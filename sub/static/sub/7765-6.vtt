YO, IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY

00:12.400 --> 00:13.460
I GOT YOU A PRESENT

00:13.560 --> 00:14.780
YO, IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY

00:14.880 --> 00:16.140
I GIVE THE BEST PRESENTS

00:16.240 --> 00:18.240
DUDE, HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU?

00:17.880 --> 00:19.880
YOU CAN'T RHYME "PRESENT"
WITH "PRESENTS."

00:19.320 --> 00:22.860
YEAH. THAT'S JUST
CARELESS RAPPING.

00:22.960 --> 00:24.300
PSSH!
WHATEVER, MAN.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.300
YOUR BIRTHDAY PRESENT
IS SO GREAT!

00:26.400 --> 00:27.660
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW!

00:27.760 --> 00:29.060
( CHUCKLES ) YEAH.

00:29.160 --> 00:30.500
I'M SURE, MAN. THANKS.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.020
DON'T THANK ME YET.

00:32.120 --> 00:34.120
THANK ME LATER TONIGHT
WHEN YOU OPEN IT AND LOVE IT,

00:33.720 --> 00:34.820
WHICH I KNOW YOU WILL.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.920
I GOT TO USE IT.

00:38.880 --> 00:40.060
OH, YEAH!

00:40.160 --> 00:42.620
PERFECT HIDING PLACE
FOR A PERFECT GIFT!

00:42.720 --> 00:45.880
MORDECAI'S GONNA LOVE IT.
I GIVE THE BEST BIRTHDAY GIFTS.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.600
Mordecai: ( Muffled )
MAN, I HATE TO SAY IT,

00:47.120 --> 00:49.120
BUT RIGBY GIVES
THE WORST BIRTHDAY GIFTS.

00:48.760 --> 00:49.940
HUH?

00:50.040 --> 00:52.180
REALLY? IT SOUNDED LIKE
HE GOT YOU SOMETHING

00:52.280 --> 00:53.460
REALLY GOOD THIS TIME.

00:53.560 --> 00:55.340
NAH. HE NEVER PUTS
ANY THOUGHT INTO THEM.

00:55.440 --> 00:57.920
AND IF HE DOES, THEY'RE USUALLY
JUST GIFTS HE GETS FOR HIMSELF.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.940
IT'S COOL, THOUGH.
I'VE GOTTEN USED TO IT.

01:00.040 --> 01:02.040
( Rapping )
YO, IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY

01:01.280 --> 01:02.660
I GOT YOU A PRESENT

01:07.040 --> 01:10.040
YO, IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY
I GIVE THE BEST PRESENTS

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
MY PRESENTS AREN'T THAT BAD,
ARE THEY?

01:13.440 --> 01:16.540
OH, NO. I GOT TO GET HIM
SOMETHING BETTER.

01:16.640 --> 01:19.380
WHAT TO GET MORDECAI?

01:19.480 --> 01:20.980
MORDECAI.

01:21.080 --> 01:24.100
MOR...DE...CAI...

01:24.200 --> 01:25.420
GIFT FOR MORDECAI.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.380
MORDECAI FOR GIFT.

01:27.480 --> 01:28.540
HMM.

01:28.640 --> 01:30.580
HMMMMM.

01:30.680 --> 01:32.740
UGH.

01:32.840 --> 01:34.660
( SIGHS )

01:34.760 --> 01:37.740
UGGGGHHH!

01:37.840 --> 01:40.260
THAT'S IT!
MORDECAI LIKES THINGS I LIKE.

01:40.360 --> 01:41.380
I LIKE VIDEO GAMES.

01:41.480 --> 01:43.180
AND MORDECAI LIKES VIDEO GAMES.

01:43.280 --> 01:44.980
I'LL GET MORDECAI A VIDEO GAME.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.440
WHOA!
"VIOLENT FIST 2: FIST FIRST!"

01:47.880 --> 01:49.780
THE NEW GAME FROM TENDINDO!
SOLD!

01:49.880 --> 01:51.880
WHAT?! 60 BUCKS?!

01:52.760 --> 01:54.760
HEY, DO YOU GUYS HAVE
ANYTHING CHEAPER?

01:54.080 --> 01:55.700
I GUESS
YOU'RE NOT INTO QUALITY.

01:55.800 --> 01:58.400
FEEL FREE TO RIFLE THROUGH
THE DISCOUNT BIN LIKE A PEASANT.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.600
UGH!

02:03.480 --> 02:04.500
( MUTTERS )

02:04.600 --> 02:06.220
THESE GAMES ARE LAME!

02:06.320 --> 02:08.180
DOGâCART RACING FOR $49?!

02:08.280 --> 02:10.380
I CAN'T AFFORD ANY OF THESE.

02:10.480 --> 02:12.560
WELL, I GUESS OUR INTERACTION
IS DONE THEN.

02:14.840 --> 02:16.660
( SLURPS )

02:16.760 --> 02:18.860
HEY, RIGBY.
WHAT'S GOT YOU DOWN?

02:18.960 --> 02:21.040
I WAS TRYING TO FIND MORDECAI
A NEW BIRTHDAY GIFT,

02:21.120 --> 02:23.360
BUT I THINK I MIGHT HAVE TO
GIVE HIM THIS ONE.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.380
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T GIVE HIM
THAT, RIGHT?

02:26.480 --> 02:27.500
UGH!

02:27.600 --> 02:29.600
I REALLY WANT TO GET HIM
A VIDEO GAME,

02:29.160 --> 02:31.160
BUT THEY'RE JUST
TOO EXPENSIVE!

02:30.360 --> 02:34.220
THEN WHY DON'T YOU JUST MAKE
A VIDEO GAME?

02:34.320 --> 02:37.180
ALLOW ME
TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

02:37.280 --> 02:38.980
I AM ZAXââ OOP.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.660
UH, I AM ZAXON!

02:40.760 --> 02:43.140
WHAT IF I TOLD
YOU CAN MAKE YOUR VERY OWN

02:43.240 --> 02:46.700
INTERACTIVE WORLD
WITH YOUR MIND?

02:46.800 --> 02:48.800
OBSERVE!

02:58.360 --> 03:03.140
ZAXOâOâOâOâN!

03:03.240 --> 03:04.580
OH, HELLO.

03:04.680 --> 03:05.820
I DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.900
But I felt your presence.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.220
I'M HERE TO SHOW YOU
AN EXCITING NEW PROGRAM

03:10.320 --> 03:13.520
THAT I HAVE DEVELOPED.
IT'S CALLED ZIPGIDZ!

03:17.080 --> 03:18.220
ZIPGIDZ ââ

03:18.320 --> 03:20.820
ZAXON'S INTELLIGENT
PLAYER TO GAME

03:20.920 --> 03:23.100
INTERFACE DESIGN BY ZAXON.

03:23.200 --> 03:26.820
I FIRST DEVELOPED THE PROGRAM
WHILE WORKING AT TENDINDO GAMES,

03:26.920 --> 03:29.940
THE TOP COMPANY LEADING THE WAY
IN A VIDEOâGAME RENAISSANCE.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.820
YOU GUYS,
I GOT A GREAT IDEA!

03:31.920 --> 03:33.660
WHAT IF THERE WAS
A PROGRAM

03:33.760 --> 03:36.220
WHERE YOU COULD MAKE
YOUR OWN VIDEO GAME?

03:36.320 --> 03:37.700
WHAT?!
YOU'RE JUST A JANITOR.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.180
YOU CAN'T MAKE VIDEO GAMES.

03:39.280 --> 03:40.500
( LAUGHTER )

03:40.600 --> 03:42.900
ANYBODY CAN MAKE
A VIDEO GAME!

03:43.000 --> 03:47.420
I'LL SHOW YOU!
I'LL SHOW ALL OF YOU!

03:47.520 --> 03:49.260
AND I DID SHOW THEM.

03:49.360 --> 03:53.620
SURE, ANY HOTSHOT "PROGRAMMER"
CAN MAKE A VIDEO GAME,

03:53.720 --> 03:56.500
BUT WITH
MY EASYâTOâUSE SOFTWARE,

03:56.600 --> 03:59.460
ANY SOâANDâSO
WITH A FREE AFTERNOON

03:59.560 --> 04:02.500
CAN MAKE ONE OF THEIR OWN,
EVEN YOU!

04:02.600 --> 04:03.460
EVEN ME?

04:03.560 --> 04:05.380
YES, YOU!
YES, YOU!

04:05.480 --> 04:08.420
WITH MY HIGHâTECH,
FUTURISTIC EQUIPMENT,

04:08.520 --> 04:12.140
THE ELECTRODES IN YOUR CEREBRAL
IMAGINATION CORTEX

04:12.240 --> 04:15.020
CAN FORMULATE
YOUR OWN VIRTUAL WORLD.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.700
SO, SIT BACK
AND LET YOUR MIND DO THE WORK.

04:17.800 --> 04:18.860
( SLURPS )

04:18.960 --> 04:21.540
( SIGHS )

04:21.640 --> 04:23.840
THAT VIDEO WAS UNINFORMATIVE
AND POORLY PRODUCED.

04:23.920 --> 04:26.100
THERE'S NO WAY
ANYONE WOULD FALL FOR THAT.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.580
( ENGINE TURNS OVER )

04:27.680 --> 04:29.540
( CHUCKLES )

04:29.640 --> 04:30.940
( HORN BEEPS )

04:31.040 --> 04:33.040
EXCEPT MY BOYFRIEND.

04:35.280 --> 04:36.580
WHOA!

04:36.680 --> 04:38.580
YOU MADE ALL OF THESE?

04:38.680 --> 04:39.660
ARE YOU A WIZARD?

04:39.760 --> 04:40.820
OF SORTS.

04:40.920 --> 04:43.300
BUT I KNOW NO TRICKS,
ONLY TRUTH.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.580
AND THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER
IS YOU PROMISED

04:45.680 --> 04:46.700
YOU'D GIVE YOUR FRIEND

04:46.800 --> 04:48.340
AN AMAZING BIRTHDAY GIFT
TONIGHT,

04:48.440 --> 04:49.700
SO LET'S GET TO IT!

04:49.800 --> 04:52.100
ALL RIGHT. SO, I JUST THINK UP
A GAME AND THAT'S IT?

04:52.200 --> 04:54.380
YES,
BUT FIRST WE MUST RUN

04:54.480 --> 04:57.780
VERY INTENSE PHYSICAL
AND MENTAL TESTS.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.060
AW, WHAT?!

04:59.160 --> 05:02.500
LET THE INTENSE
TRAINING MONTAGE BEGIN!

05:56.960 --> 05:58.100
( BEEPS )

05:58.200 --> 05:59.580
THE RESULTS ARE IN.

05:59.680 --> 06:02.940
THE PHYSICAL PORTION OF YOUR
TEST WAS MOST IMPRESSIVE.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.940
IN FACT,
IT WAS OFF THE CHARTS.

06:05.040 --> 06:06.220
YES!

06:06.320 --> 06:08.780
THE I.Q. PORTION
IS OFF THE CHARTS AS WELL,

06:08.880 --> 06:09.820
BUT IN A BAD WAY.

06:09.920 --> 06:11.140
LIKE,
LITERALLY IT'S SO LOW

06:11.240 --> 06:12.820
THAT IT'S NOT EVEN
ON THE CHARTS.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.920
I THINK
I'VE EATEN WALNUTS

06:14.120 --> 06:16.120
WITH A HIGHER INTELLECT
THAN YOURS.

06:15.720 --> 06:17.720
WHAT?! DOES THAT MEAN
I CAN'T MAKE A VIDEO GAME?

06:17.640 --> 06:20.380
NO. DON'T YOU REMEMBER
MY PROMOTIONAL VHS?

06:20.480 --> 06:22.460
ANYBODY CAN MAKE
A VIDEO GAME.

06:22.560 --> 06:26.580
TIME TO PUT ON A REALLY COOL
HELMET THAT I INVENTED MYSELF!

06:26.680 --> 06:29.940
THESE HELMETS WILL VIRTUALLY
TRANSPORT US INTO YOUR HEAD.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.980
ONCE WE'RE IN, YOU CAN MAKE
THE GAME WITH YOUR MIND.

06:33.080 --> 06:35.060
HOWEVER,
BECAUSE OF YOUR LOW I.Q.,

06:35.160 --> 06:37.140
THERE WILL BE BUGS
IN THE SYSTEM.

06:37.240 --> 06:38.700
âBUGS?
âBUT FEAR NOT.

06:38.800 --> 06:41.520
WHEN THE TIME COMES,
I WILL HELP YOU FACE THEM.

06:42.760 --> 06:44.760
BY THE WAY,
THESE HELMETS COULD KILL US.

06:44.240 --> 06:45.100
WAIT, WHAT?

06:45.200 --> 06:47.200
UGH, UH, AAAAH!

06:49.360 --> 06:50.380
WHOA!

06:50.480 --> 06:52.460
SO THIS IS
WHAT MY MIND LOOKS LIKE.

06:52.560 --> 06:55.260
YES, BUT THINK ABOUT WHAT
YOU WANT THE GAME TO BE.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.740
UH...I WANT IT TO BE
AT THE PARK, I GUESS.

07:01.560 --> 07:02.780
WHOA!

07:02.880 --> 07:05.540
NOW I WANT MORDECAI
AND SKIPS TO BE IN IT.

07:05.640 --> 07:07.380
AND THEY'VE GOT
A BIRTHDAY CAKE!

07:07.480 --> 07:09.380
( BEEPS )
HEY, DUDE!

07:09.480 --> 07:12.980
( Garbled ) COME UP
AND EAT SOME BIRTHDAY CAAAAKE!

07:13.080 --> 07:15.140
NOW ADD
SOME OBSTACLES.

07:15.240 --> 07:18.900
OH, YOU MEAN LIKE JUMPS
AND HOLES AND STUFF?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.060
AAH!

07:20.160 --> 07:22.160
NO, NO, NO!
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT!

07:21.360 --> 07:23.020
( RUMBLING )

07:29.960 --> 07:30.860
AW, MAN!

07:30.960 --> 07:32.780
"AW, MAN" IS RIGHT!

07:32.880 --> 07:35.700
NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS GET TO THE CAKE AT THE END

07:35.800 --> 07:37.860
AND THE VIDEO GAME
WILL BE MADE.

07:37.960 --> 07:39.460
JUST REMEMBER
YOUR TRAINING.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.560
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DO THIS.

07:46.160 --> 07:47.740
AAAH! THE BUGS! RUN!

07:47.840 --> 07:49.460
AAAH!

07:49.560 --> 07:50.860
WHY ARE THERE SO MANY?!

07:50.960 --> 07:53.540
ACTUALLY, BASED ON YOUR
LOW I.Q., I WAS EXPECTING MORE.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.620
QUICK! UP HERE!

07:54.720 --> 07:56.500

08:16.640 --> 08:18.300
GO. I'LL HOLD THEM OFF.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.220
NO!
I CAN'T JUST LEAVE YOU.

08:20.320 --> 08:23.260
YOUR FRIEND ONLY HAS A BIRTHDAY
ONCE A YEAR.

08:23.360 --> 08:26.980
FINISH THE GAME SO YOU CAN
GIVE HIM THE BEST GIFT EVER!

08:27.080 --> 08:29.420
HAH! AAH!

08:29.520 --> 08:32.100
OH, AND RIGBY, PROVE TO THEM

08:32.200 --> 08:36.460
THAT ANYONE CAN MAKE
A VIDEO GAME, EVEN YOU!

08:36.560 --> 08:38.020
ZAXON!

08:38.120 --> 08:40.120
AAH!

08:51.080 --> 08:52.340

( SCREAMS )

09:06.240 --> 09:08.240
REMEMBER YOUR TRAINING.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.600

Man: <i>YOU WIN!</i>

09:30.680 --> 09:32.380
HAVE SOME CAKE, BEST FRIEND!

09:32.480 --> 09:36.360
OH, YEAH! PIECE OF CAKE!

09:38.400 --> 09:39.780
AW, MAN.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.820

09:41.920 --> 09:43.920
YOU FOUGHT WELL,
OLD FRIEND.

09:45.520 --> 09:46.820
( GASPS )

09:46.920 --> 09:49.540
I'M NOT REALLY DEAD,
JUST "VIDEO GAME" DEAD.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.140

09:55.240 --> 09:56.500

09:56.600 --> 09:57.460
MORDECAI!

09:57.560 --> 09:59.020
DUDE,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

09:59.120 --> 10:01.120
YOU WENT TO THE BATHROOM
YESTERDAY AND NEVER CAME BACK.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.180
YOU MISSED MY BIRTHDAY!

10:02.280 --> 10:04.400
LOOK, MORDECAI, I KNOW MY GIFTS
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LAME,

10:04.480 --> 10:05.860
BUT I REALLY TRIED
THIS TIME.

10:05.960 --> 10:07.980
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MAN

10:08.080 --> 10:09.020
A VIDEO GAME?

10:09.120 --> 10:10.500
MADE BY YOURS TRULY!

10:10.600 --> 10:11.580
WHAT?!

10:11.680 --> 10:13.340
NO WAY.
YOU DIDN'T MAKE THIS.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.700
NO, BUT MY MIND DID.

YOU REALLY DID MAKE THIS,
HUH?

10:30.920 --> 10:32.420
YEP.

10:32.520 --> 10:34.520
THIS IS THE BEST GIFT
YOU'VE EVER GIVEN ME.
