[birds chirping]

00:08.747 --> 00:09.748
Hi.

00:24.763 --> 00:26.722
There's just so many
different options.

00:26.765 --> 00:29.420
Of course, bro.
And you deserve it all.

00:29.464 --> 00:31.422
What kind of shampoo do you use?

00:31.466 --> 00:33.250
Not none of this.
My shit is natural, bro.

00:33.294 --> 00:35.252
Like, my cousin make
my shit from scratch.

00:35.296 --> 00:36.949
[alert chimes]

00:36.993 --> 00:38.212
Are you saying black people
don't buy products

00:38.255 --> 00:39.430
from stores like this?

00:39.474 --> 00:41.302
I'm not saying that at all, bro.

00:41.345 --> 00:43.173
But what I'm saying is,
there's way too many chemicals

00:43.217 --> 00:46.089
on these shelves
for my natural dreadlocks.

00:46.133 --> 00:49.353
But you look likea Head & Shoulders type of dude.

00:49.397 --> 00:51.660
Like, uh-- 'cause dandruff?

00:51.703 --> 00:53.357
I have visible dandruff?

00:53.401 --> 00:55.272
Hey. Y'all need
something unlocked?

00:55.316 --> 00:58.319
Uh, no, actually.
I'm just wondering about

00:58.362 --> 01:00.930
this three-in-one
body wash-shampoo-conditioner.

01:00.973 --> 01:02.758
I don't really see a world
where a single product

01:02.801 --> 01:05.456
can do all three
of those tasks at once.

01:05.500 --> 01:09.330
Y-You should only hit the buttonif you need something unlocked.

01:09.373 --> 01:10.505
Really?

01:10.548 --> 01:12.898
It says "Push button for help."

01:12.942 --> 01:15.162
-Just help.
-Y'all got Wi-Fi here, bro?

01:15.205 --> 01:17.338
-Nah.
-No Wi-Fi?

01:17.381 --> 01:19.383
DAVE:
Maybe a body wash
could work as a shampoo,

01:19.427 --> 01:21.255
but there's no way
that a body wash

01:21.298 --> 01:23.344
can somehow turn
into a conditioner.

01:23.387 --> 01:25.346
Like, one item can't be
something that it's not.

01:25.389 --> 01:28.131
A nail can't be, like, a shoe.

01:28.175 --> 01:29.915
GATA:
You crazy, bro.
I used to wash my hair

01:29.959 --> 01:31.134
with a bar of soap
like a barbarian.

01:31.178 --> 01:33.223
Got my shit straight,
like, real clean.

01:33.267 --> 01:35.356
-Soap on the head?
-Come on, bro. A bar of soap.

01:35.399 --> 01:36.748
Smaller than a Tic Tac, bro.

01:36.792 --> 01:38.707
-That shit was clean, bro.
-Okay.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.361
I-I'll be at the counter.
if you need me,

01:40.404 --> 01:41.840
you know how to get me.

01:41.884 --> 01:44.147
Thanks a lot
for the help, Jesús.

01:44.191 --> 01:45.975
It's Jesus.

01:47.368 --> 01:48.934
MIKE:
Hey.

01:48.978 --> 01:51.372
I found the perfect acne regime.

01:51.415 --> 01:52.721
We're not getting
out of that tub

01:52.764 --> 01:54.375
until we totally rid
your back of the bacne.

01:54.418 --> 01:56.768
-Tonight, we scrub.
-Hold on.

01:56.812 --> 01:58.727
-Y'all take baths together?
-Yeah.

01:58.770 --> 02:00.511
When I carve out the time
from work. It is hard.

02:00.555 --> 02:02.774
-But it is my favorite part
of the week.
-Mine, too.

02:02.818 --> 02:04.776
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.
It's a great time.
-[alert chimes]

02:04.820 --> 02:07.562
Oh, I got to go get me somethingto drink. That's too much.

02:07.605 --> 02:09.041
-Where is he going?
-This stuff--

02:09.085 --> 02:10.173
He's going to get
something to drink.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.175
-Yeah, I want to get a razor.
-Yes?

02:13.437 --> 02:15.787
-Listen, man...
-♪ Hi, I'm Dave♪

02:15.831 --> 02:17.528
-♪ I'm Lil Dicky♪
-♪ Hi, I'm Dave♪

02:17.572 --> 02:18.834
-♪ Who's Dave?♪
-♪ Hi, I'm Dave.♪

02:18.877 --> 02:22.403
You need me and I need you.

02:22.446 --> 02:24.013
[laughter]

02:24.056 --> 02:25.188
Almost there.

02:25.232 --> 02:28.539
No, stop,
you are killing me. Ugh.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.541
Why? Because I am not
biodegradable

02:30.585 --> 02:32.456
and contribute to landfill?

02:32.500 --> 02:34.371
ZACK:
Yes.

02:34.415 --> 02:36.417
Don't flush so much,
don't flush so much,

02:36.460 --> 02:37.374
don't flush so much,

02:37.418 --> 02:39.115
don't flush
so much!

02:39.159 --> 02:42.771
-[laughter]
-Too early.

02:42.814 --> 02:45.295
KIDS:
Save the Earth.

02:45.339 --> 02:46.905
I'm so happy you came.

02:46.949 --> 02:48.777
Thank you for having me,
Muhammad Ali.

02:48.820 --> 02:50.170
They were so good, right?

02:51.519 --> 02:54.261
-Uh, yeah.
-Dave.

02:54.304 --> 02:55.566
No, like, I just have
no context here.

02:55.610 --> 02:56.915
I've never seen
anything like that.

02:56.959 --> 02:58.265
I don't know what
a rival school would've done

02:58.308 --> 03:00.571
with the same platform, and...

03:00.615 --> 03:03.487
Um, but I loved
your directorial style.

03:03.531 --> 03:05.228
-Really?
-Yeah.

03:05.272 --> 03:06.403
I love how you loose
you keep it,

03:06.447 --> 03:08.710
-and how you let them just...
-Loose?

03:08.753 --> 03:10.364
I'm saying I enjoyed it.
It was fun.

03:10.407 --> 03:12.104
Dave, what are you
talking about?

03:12.148 --> 03:13.715
Can you be normal for two...

03:13.758 --> 03:15.717
Hey. Sorry to interrupt.

03:15.760 --> 03:19.242
Um, so just heard that
we're closing in on Friday

03:19.286 --> 03:20.504
for John Levan's memorial.

03:20.548 --> 03:22.114
-Oh.
-That's the kid that died?

03:22.158 --> 03:24.726
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah. Very terrible.

03:24.769 --> 03:26.684
The cops have no leads at all?

03:26.728 --> 03:29.078
He wasn't murdered, Dave.

03:29.121 --> 03:30.906
I'm just saying, it's--
they haven't solved it, so...

03:30.949 --> 03:33.604
-They don't...
-So, hey, this is weird,

03:33.648 --> 03:37.173
but John was
a big Lil Dicky fan.

03:37.217 --> 03:40.263
That's awesome. Or... Yeah.

03:40.307 --> 03:42.526
Yeah, so, his parents are here,and they asked to meet you.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.528
DAVE:
Oh, okay.

03:44.572 --> 03:45.877
All right. What do I say?

03:45.921 --> 03:48.097
Just say hi.
It's not a big deal.

03:48.140 --> 03:49.446
-Right?
-Okay. Yeah, no. No big deal.

03:49.490 --> 03:51.274
I mean, you should
acknowledge t-their loss.

03:51.318 --> 03:53.363
Without saying,
"Sorry for your loss,"

03:53.407 --> 03:55.322
'cause I'm sure they're, like,
totally sick of hearing that.

03:55.365 --> 03:56.540
Maybe just don't
talk about it at all.

03:56.584 --> 04:00.152
But let them know that you knowby being somber?

04:00.196 --> 04:01.893
But nice.

04:03.330 --> 04:06.158
Okay. I'm just...
That's so much to think about.

04:06.202 --> 04:08.552
I'm just gonna say hi and, like,let them steer the conversation.

04:08.596 --> 04:10.293
Okay. Godspeed.

04:11.555 --> 04:13.340
Hi.

04:13.383 --> 04:14.515
-Oh. Hi.
-Dave. Nice to meet you.

04:14.558 --> 04:16.647
-Craig.
-Pam. Nice to meet you.
-Pam.

04:16.691 --> 04:18.736
-How are you?
-Oh, and this is Zack.
This is, uh, John's brother.

04:18.780 --> 04:20.738
Hey, Zack. Is this
Daniel Day-Lewis right here?

04:20.782 --> 04:23.437
-[laughter]
-How you doing kid?
You were great.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.568
All right, see you later, bud.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.353
We're gonna save you, Earth.

04:26.396 --> 04:28.572
Wow. He was good.

04:28.616 --> 04:30.357
-So...
-Thank you.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.707
...John just loved you.

04:32.750 --> 04:35.579
Oh, thank you so much,
or thank him.

04:35.623 --> 04:39.366
I-I mean, really, y-you were
one of his favorite rappers.

04:39.409 --> 04:40.454
PAM:Yeah. He-he loved guys like you

04:40.497 --> 04:41.977
and Macklemore and...

04:42.020 --> 04:43.544
You know,
all those kinds of guys.

04:43.587 --> 04:47.112
-[laughs softly]
-Yeah. Macklemore.

04:47.156 --> 04:50.115
You know, we weren't gonna ask,but we would just love it

04:50.159 --> 04:54.294
if you would perform a song
about John at his memorial.

04:55.512 --> 04:57.993
Oh. Uh, sure.

04:58.036 --> 04:59.995
-[exhales] Thank you, Dave.
-Oh, that'd be amazing.

05:00.038 --> 05:02.476
Oh, my gosh. Come here.That would mean the world to us.

05:02.519 --> 05:04.042
-Yeah.
-Uh, yeah.
-Thank you.

05:04.086 --> 05:06.131
-And you-you said aboutJohn.
-Mm-hmm.

05:06.175 --> 05:07.916
Okay, a song about--
'cause I don't-- you know,

05:07.959 --> 05:10.135
I've never met him.
I don't know much about him.

05:10.179 --> 05:11.920
If you just give me your e-mail,I can shoot over some thoughts.

05:11.963 --> 05:13.965
-Yes.
-Like, factoids about...

05:14.009 --> 05:15.576
-Yeah, that would help. Okay.
-Exactly.

05:15.619 --> 05:20.755
Uh, it's DonCheadlesDriveway
@lildicky2.com.

05:20.798 --> 05:23.497
I know it's complex.
I do it 'cause hackers.

05:23.540 --> 05:25.412
-Okay.
-And I hate
to break this to you,

05:25.455 --> 05:28.153
but I've actually never
performed live before, so...

05:28.197 --> 05:30.460
-No, w-we don't care.
-No, we don't...

05:30.504 --> 05:33.245
-That's even probably better.
-Yeah.

05:33.289 --> 05:35.247
And you guys have
seen my stuff, right?

05:35.291 --> 05:37.467
Because, like, it's pretty racy

05:37.511 --> 05:40.209
and, like, has this comedic toneto it that I think

05:40.252 --> 05:42.429
could be pretty
ill-fitting for...

05:42.472 --> 05:43.604
Do what you do, sweetheart.

05:43.647 --> 05:46.781
Make it funny,
and-and heartfelt.

05:46.824 --> 05:48.522
Okay.

05:48.565 --> 05:51.612
-And cool.
-Yeah.
-Sure.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.527
I am a professional. I do have
a slow process typically,

05:53.570 --> 05:55.311
but I will try
to turn something around.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.400
-Let's get, uh-- Come on.
-Yeah.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.576
-Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
-Thank you.
Oh, thank you so much.

06:05.539 --> 06:07.889
[music playing loudly]

06:07.932 --> 06:09.456
[door closes]

06:09.499 --> 06:11.501
DAVE:
It's just not my vision

06:11.545 --> 06:13.285
for my first performance ever.

06:13.329 --> 06:15.418
Okay, well, maybe, then,
it's just the kick in the butt

06:15.462 --> 06:17.289
-you need to get it over with.
-[music stops]

06:17.333 --> 06:19.291
I haven't needed
a kick in the butt.

06:19.335 --> 06:21.642
I've been being very strategic
about when to perform live.

06:21.685 --> 06:24.340
And, like, the moment.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.429
Okay, well, at least
it's a good deed,

06:26.473 --> 06:30.215
and good things come
to people who do good deeds.

06:30.259 --> 06:31.695
-Yo.
-Oh, my God.

06:31.739 --> 06:33.088
-Don't sneak up
on me like that.
-Wow.

06:33.131 --> 06:34.611
Sorry, Emma.

06:34.655 --> 06:36.613
I have to catch you up
on what just happened to me

06:36.657 --> 06:39.703
at Ally's little
play thing, okay?

06:39.747 --> 06:43.098
I'm now being forced to performfor the first time

06:43.141 --> 06:45.274
at a dead kid's funeral.

06:45.317 --> 06:47.581
I like the sound of all of this.

06:47.624 --> 06:49.583
Okay, he went to my school

06:49.626 --> 06:52.455
and was apparently
a really big fan of Dave's.

06:52.499 --> 06:54.892
And I appreciate that,
and I totally understand

06:54.936 --> 06:57.112
that a-a kid is dead.
I get that.

06:57.155 --> 06:59.070
But the nature in which
his parents asked

06:59.114 --> 07:01.116
just lackedall social awareness, you know?

07:01.159 --> 07:02.596
They're not even like,
"What are you doing?

07:02.639 --> 07:04.554
Are you free this weekend?"

07:04.598 --> 07:07.035
If-if human beings
don't have manners,

07:07.078 --> 07:08.253
we're, like, wild animals.

07:08.297 --> 07:09.820
You know what I mean? Like...

07:09.864 --> 07:12.910
Then what separates man
from geese?

07:12.954 --> 07:15.652
Yeah, I feel like they probablyhad a lot on their plate.

07:15.696 --> 07:17.480
DAVE:
This just sucks.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.047
I don't know how else to say it.This sucks.

07:19.090 --> 07:21.179
I think one of the reasons
I'm so riled up is, 'cause,

07:21.223 --> 07:23.181
like, I'm just so sick of beingcompared to Macklemore

07:23.225 --> 07:26.097
-at every moment, and that's...-Dave, people love Macklemore.

07:26.141 --> 07:28.622
Emma, am I anything
like Macklemore?

07:28.665 --> 07:30.972
-Never met him.
-Well, I'm nothing like him.

07:31.015 --> 07:33.061
-Couldn't be less like him.
-Couldn't--

07:33.104 --> 07:36.891
You're a snowflake,
and I'm gonna take a shower.

07:36.934 --> 07:40.329
"Spotify related artists:
Lil Dicky, Macklemore..."
-Yeah.

07:40.372 --> 07:42.331
-"Lonely Island, G-Eazy..."
-I know. I know.

07:42.374 --> 07:44.768
I've seen it. I've-I see it
every day a hundred times.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.204
I've written
so many e-mails about it.

07:46.248 --> 07:48.076
It's the most annoying--
It's unprofessional.

07:48.119 --> 07:52.167
I should be categorized with,
like, Young Thug and Kanye.

07:52.210 --> 07:54.517
Your rap name is literally
a small penis joke.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.432
It's actually a super
intellectual commentary

07:56.476 --> 07:57.955
on hypermasculinity.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.653
Your first single was
"My Dick Sucks."

07:59.696 --> 08:00.958
First off,
it was very successful.

08:01.002 --> 08:03.352
Second off, it had to be overt

08:03.395 --> 08:04.919
'cause it's my first content
that I'm putting out.

08:04.962 --> 08:06.660
I had to be very kind of
on the nose with it.

08:06.703 --> 08:08.531
Oh, I hope you don't
mistake my questions

08:08.575 --> 08:10.620
for me actually caring.

08:10.664 --> 08:12.230
Well, that was rude.

08:12.274 --> 08:14.581
All right, slug,
I'm going to bed.

08:14.624 --> 08:15.930
Good night.

08:19.934 --> 08:21.979
-[beat playing]
-DAVE: No.

08:22.023 --> 08:25.156
-[different beat playing]
-No, like...

08:25.200 --> 08:26.897
it's, like, too urban.

08:26.941 --> 08:29.639
Too urban?
