00:01.102 --> 00:02.770
(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:02.803 --> 00:05.073
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:05.106 --> 00:07.675
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:07.708 --> 00:09.443
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:09.477 --> 00:11.212
are members
of an elite squad

00:11.245 --> 00:12.680
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.515
These are their stories.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.494
What's wrong?

00:26.527 --> 00:28.329
Look at those.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.498
Look at this.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.766
I have been searching all over
the city for that pair of shoes.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.735
I'll buy them
for you tomorrow.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.604
We have to get here
when the store opens.

00:41.109 --> 00:43.077
Wait a second.

00:43.111 --> 00:44.645
Now what?

00:44.678 --> 00:48.182
That's not a mannequin.

00:48.216 --> 00:49.450
Oh, my God.

00:54.788 --> 00:56.290
(Fin)
Who is he?

00:56.324 --> 00:58.659
Robin Weller, 27.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.661
What, he had
his wallet under his hands too?

01:00.694 --> 01:03.464
In the storeroom,
in his pants pocket.

01:03.497 --> 01:04.598
Along with his keys.

01:04.632 --> 01:05.866
One opens the front door.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.536
He worked here.

01:08.569 --> 01:09.870
(Benson)
Robin was the manager.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.506
I got his name off
a phone list in the office.

01:12.540 --> 01:13.674
I called the owner.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.476
He closed the store
at 7:00 last night.

01:15.509 --> 01:17.278
Robin left at 5:00.

01:17.311 --> 01:18.412
Maybe he forgot something,
came back,

01:18.446 --> 01:19.447
and brought
the perp with him.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.514
(Benson)
Or the perp showed up

01:20.548 --> 01:22.516
after Robin
was already inside.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.318
Then Robin must have known him
and let him in.

01:24.352 --> 01:25.753
No forced entry.

01:25.786 --> 01:28.222
He was shot right here,
execution style,

01:28.256 --> 01:29.123
small caliber weapon.

01:29.157 --> 01:31.325
But there's no blood
on any of his clothes

01:31.359 --> 01:32.360
or anywhere else on him.

01:32.393 --> 01:33.894
Perp cleaned them up.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.563
This sponge was in the sink.

01:35.596 --> 01:38.366
So we're thinking
that he was forced to strip,

01:38.399 --> 01:41.269
sit in a chair,
bound with this wire,

01:41.302 --> 01:42.736
and then shot.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.273
How'd he get in the display?

01:45.306 --> 01:46.174
(Vizcarrondo)
See those marks?

01:46.207 --> 01:48.309
Perp dragged that chair
through the store

01:48.342 --> 01:50.311
and lifted the body
into the window.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.779
Guy's got a set on him,

01:51.812 --> 01:53.547
doing it in full view
of the street.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.849
Well, I don't think
anybody saw him.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.718
Those shades come
all the way down

01:57.751 --> 01:59.687
so they can change
the window dressing.

01:59.720 --> 02:02.523
Gave him all the time he needed
to stage the scene.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.592
And write "Killer"
in silver paint.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.361
(Fin)
He went to a lot of trouble
to send a message.

02:07.395 --> 02:10.531
If our dead guy's a killer,
who did he kill?

03:01.249 --> 03:02.616
The early bird
catches the perp.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.552
How we doing?

03:04.585 --> 03:05.619
It's gonna take weeks
to rule out

03:05.653 --> 03:07.388
the store employees
and customers.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.357
We got a busload
of fingerprints.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.924
I doubt the killer
left his.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.327
The crime scene
is too methodical.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.628
Wires, shoes, lights.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.297
That must've taken
at least an hour.

03:16.330 --> 03:18.399
That's a long time to go
without slipping up.

03:18.432 --> 03:19.433
I don't think
he did.

03:19.467 --> 03:20.934
Every element of the staging

03:20.968 --> 03:22.770
was intentional
and meaningful.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.638
Okay, so what's up
with these shoes?

03:24.672 --> 03:26.740
Well, they're all pointing
at Robin

03:26.774 --> 03:27.675
as if there was
a crowd around, watching.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.010
(Cragen)
So you're saying
the perp staged it

03:30.043 --> 03:31.712
like some kind
of a sick play?

03:31.745 --> 03:34.448
It's theatrical.
He wants attention.

03:34.482 --> 03:36.384
It's as if he's saying,
"Look at Robin.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.418
We all stand
in judgment of him."

03:37.451 --> 03:39.453
Your perp's trying
to tell a story.

03:39.487 --> 03:40.854
To catch him,
you're gonna need

03:40.888 --> 03:42.523
to know more
about who Robin was.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.491
(Fin)
We can ask his father.

03:43.524 --> 03:46.560
He's on his way to the morgue
to ID the body.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.000
(Weller)
That's my son.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.802
He looks so old.

03:54.835 --> 03:58.739
He's not even 30.

03:58.772 --> 04:01.475
When is the last time
you saw him?

04:04.412 --> 04:06.947
Six or seven months ago.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.649
You and him
have a falling out?

04:08.682 --> 04:11.852
Over his mother's death.

04:11.885 --> 04:15.022
My wife passed away
last year.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.558
Robin and I disagreed

04:17.591 --> 04:19.327
about her care.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.061
We'll need your permission
to search his apartment.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.663
Of course.

04:22.696 --> 04:26.534
Look, I'd like to go home
and see to the arrangements.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.602
Sure.

04:32.340 --> 04:33.641
He's not gonna be
much help.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.676
Guy's on a lifetime
guilt trip.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.645
Fights with his son
over his dying wife

04:37.678 --> 04:39.613
and never gets a chance
to say he's sorry.

04:39.647 --> 04:42.583
You should take
a look at this.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.018
(Fin)
I don't see anything.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.654
Hit the light.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.522
No fluids or sign
of sexual trauma,

04:48.556 --> 04:50.591
but check out his hand.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.092
(Benson)
"Green".

04:52.125 --> 04:53.093
Looks like one of those

04:53.126 --> 04:54.995
stamps you get when you go
in and out of a club.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.730
(Fin)
The Green Ballroom Club's

04:56.764 --> 04:57.765
on 13th Street,
not far

04:57.798 --> 04:59.567
from where
Robin was killed.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.001
If the stamp was
more than a day old,

05:01.034 --> 05:02.670
it would have washed off.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.304
Looks like
he went there last night.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.477
(Benson)
Have you ever seen this guy?

05:09.510 --> 05:10.678
(manager)
Uh, I don't recognize him,

05:10.711 --> 05:11.679
but that doesn't mean
anything.

05:11.712 --> 05:14.114
We were packed last night.
A huge circuit party.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.784
So everyone in the place
was gay.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.753
Not a lot of straight men
feel comfortable in that crowd.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.822
We need to know
who was here last night.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.057
Need to see your receipts,
talk to your bouncers.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.526
What time do they get in?

05:25.559 --> 05:27.094
7:00, but I can help
you now.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.962
Well, I thought you said
you didn't recognize him.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.731
I don't, but no one gets
in here without ID.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.633
We scan them digitally
and store them.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.701
Come on.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.103
People said our business
would fall off,

05:36.136 --> 05:37.771
you know, Big Brother watching
and all that.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.072
But nobody really
seems to care.

05:39.106 --> 05:42.009
Except the guys
who are married.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.777
There he is.

05:43.811 --> 05:45.112
Robin Weller, line 71.

05:45.145 --> 05:48.549
Came in at 11:14 last night.

05:48.582 --> 05:49.817
He may have come
with friends.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.051
We'll check the names
before and after.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.720
(manager)
The system cost 11 grand.

05:52.753 --> 05:53.687
We had to put it in

05:53.721 --> 05:54.888
after we got hit
selling liquor

05:54.922 --> 05:55.989
to a 15-year-old girl.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.659
Can you pull up the photo
on line 78?

05:58.692 --> 06:01.061
[keys tapping]

06:01.094 --> 06:04.031
Ken Randall.

06:10.504 --> 06:11.505
You know him?

06:14.642 --> 06:16.176
Yeah, I know him.

06:16.209 --> 06:19.079
[door unlatches]

06:19.112 --> 06:20.881
Dad.

06:23.484 --> 06:24.952
What are you doing here?

06:24.985 --> 06:27.655
I need to talk to you
about something.

06:27.688 --> 06:30.724
I have company.

06:30.758 --> 06:34.662
Is your company a guy?

06:34.695 --> 06:37.931
Yeah.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.933
You're gay.

06:39.967 --> 06:43.170
Yeah.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.772
You got a problem
with that, Dad?

06:49.209 --> 06:51.579
Thought so.

06:51.612 --> 06:54.448
That's why
I never told you.

06:54.482 --> 06:56.917
I gotta go.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.529
He didn't know Robin Weller,

07:08.562 --> 07:12.633
didn't recognize him
from the picture.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.234
Crime Scene's on their way
to Robin's apartment.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.037
Let's go.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.039
(O'Halloran)
Said you wanted to know
about the victim.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.575
I pulled photos and e-mails
off his computer.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.644
The victim liked to party.

07:23.677 --> 07:26.747
(Fin)
'97, somebody's got a nice crib
on Fire Island.

07:26.780 --> 07:27.881
(O'Halloran)
Plus South Beach,

07:27.915 --> 07:31.184
Palm Springs, P-Town--
all gay hot spots.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.920
He started young too.
Look at this.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.188
Palm Springs White Party,
he's just 17.

07:35.222 --> 07:38.792
And then five years later--
looks like he's 30.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.561
Father was right.
He got old quick.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.195
(Warner)
I think I know why.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.731
Anyone find
his medicine yet?

07:47.100 --> 07:49.202
Ritonavir.

07:49.236 --> 07:52.673
This one's called
Enfurvitide.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.608
Enfurvitide's a new
fusion inhibitor.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.043
Both are anti-retrovirals.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.110
So Robin was
HIV positive.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.112
He had AIDS.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.715
His T-cell count
was extremely low.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.651
And his viral load
was through the roof.

08:03.684 --> 08:04.785
And he got it recently.

08:04.818 --> 08:05.719
How do you know?

08:05.753 --> 08:07.721
When I saw his blood work,

08:07.755 --> 08:11.158
I had the Health Department
fax me his notification letter.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.664
He tested HIV positive
six months ago.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.298
Isn't that awfully fast
to get full-blown AIDS?

08:18.331 --> 08:19.299
It's unusual.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.068
Speaking of which,

08:21.101 --> 08:22.302
I already got a phone call

08:22.335 --> 08:23.871
requesting Robin's
death certificate.

08:23.904 --> 08:26.574
The body's not even cold.
Who called?

08:26.607 --> 08:27.775
An insurance company.

08:27.808 --> 08:30.110
His father took out
a policy on him.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.879
How much?

08:31.912 --> 08:33.914
$500,000.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.883
We checked your financials.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.618
You don't have
a nickel in the bank.

08:37.651 --> 08:38.919
Your credit rating's
down the toilet.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.988
You're broke.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.256
You think I murdered Robin
for the insurance money?

08:43.290 --> 08:45.859
Half a mil would solve
your cash flow problems.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.160
You don't understand.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.829
We spent all our money
on him.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.931
On a son
you weren't speaking to?

08:53.166 --> 08:54.267
[sighs]

08:54.301 --> 08:55.703
That happened later.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.741
When his mother was sick,

09:00.774 --> 09:02.810
Robin came home.

09:02.843 --> 09:04.011
I hadn't seen him
in years.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.178
Why?

09:09.249 --> 09:10.217
[sighs]

09:10.250 --> 09:13.020
When he was 16...

09:13.053 --> 09:15.956
he told us he was gay.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.825
I couldn't deal with it.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.226
I kicked him out.

09:21.294 --> 09:22.596
When he came back,

09:22.630 --> 09:24.364
I barely recognized him.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.634
He looked terrible.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.869
I-I asked him
what was wrong.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.270
He said he had
a drug problem.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.740
He wanted to stop,
but he couldn't.

09:32.773 --> 09:35.142
You try to help him?

09:35.175 --> 09:38.712
I spent our entire life savings
paying for his rehabs.

09:38.746 --> 09:41.849
I couldn't even afford
a proper funeral for my wife.

09:43.784 --> 09:46.119
Robin never stayed

09:46.153 --> 09:49.022
clean more than a few months.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.358
I knew it was just
a matter of time...

09:51.391 --> 09:54.127
before he overdosed.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.863
So while he was clean,

09:55.896 --> 09:57.698
you took out
an insurance policy

09:57.731 --> 09:59.867
to get your money back?

09:59.900 --> 10:04.672
I knew Robin
was going to die.

10:04.705 --> 10:08.075
If it wasn't from drugs,
it would be AIDS.

10:08.108 --> 10:13.013
Or that boyfriend of his.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.982
They had
a violent relationship?

10:15.015 --> 10:16.316
Last time I spoke
to Robin,

10:16.349 --> 10:19.653
he called from
the emergency room,

10:19.687 --> 10:22.122
crying that the guy
had beat him up.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.891
You know
the boyfriend's name?

10:26.026 --> 10:27.995
Lydon Grant.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.865
(male super)
You sure this is okay?

10:31.899 --> 10:34.301
(Fin)
Come on, man, let's go.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.236
No one home.

10:41.775 --> 10:45.178
Oh, looks like
a snowstorm in here.

10:45.212 --> 10:46.313
What the hell happened?

10:55.022 --> 10:57.124
Fin.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.329
"Killer".

11:07.467 --> 11:09.202
(Warner)
Single gunshot to the head.

11:09.236 --> 11:12.139
Entry wound, small bore--
just like Robin Weller.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.440
Same theatrics,
same perp.

11:13.473 --> 11:15.008
How long has he been dead?

11:15.042 --> 11:16.810
Still warm,
just going into rigor.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.245
I'd say no more
than eight hours.

11:18.278 --> 11:21.081
It wasn't a snow globe
that got busted in here.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.082
Crystal?

11:22.115 --> 11:23.984
80% pure
methamphetamine.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.920
Sex drug of choice.

11:26.954 --> 11:28.989
Took a lot of crank
to blanket Lydon's loft.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.323
Worth a hell of a lot
on the street.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.125
Think the murder's
about meth?

11:32.159 --> 11:34.795
Well, we know that Robin
and Lydon were lovers.

11:34.828 --> 11:37.297
It's even money.
If Lydon used, so did Robin.

11:37.330 --> 11:38.098
Explains the rehab

11:38.131 --> 11:39.499
and why Robin
looked so much older.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.334
I mean, meth ages you fast.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.303
And it makes you violent
and paranoid.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.839
Could be they both got high one
night and killed somebody,

11:45.873 --> 11:47.841
and this is just payback.

11:47.875 --> 11:48.976
But it doesn't scan.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.778
We talked to family,
friends, colleagues.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.880
These guys were well-liked.
There's no criminal records.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.347
Crystal can change
all that.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.817
Lydon had meth in his
bloodstream when he was shot.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.218
(Fin)
He wasn't just using.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.387
Nobody keeps that much around
unless they're dealing.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.890
Now, if he's a drug dealer,
this could be a turf war.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.125
Which means our perp
could be another dealer.

12:05.158 --> 12:08.061
Let's find out if Narcotics
has Lydon on their radar.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.466
(Pizzelli)
We got nothing in the system

12:13.500 --> 12:15.102
on this Robin Weller.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.771
But this guy Lydon Grant,
he's just

12:17.805 --> 12:19.873
a blip on the screen,
low-level meth dealer.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.341
Don't have much on him.

12:21.374 --> 12:22.409
Where'd your intel
come from?

12:22.442 --> 12:24.044
Wiretap last year.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.312
We were up on a cell phone

12:25.345 --> 12:27.214
that belonged
to a runner for MKS.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.148
MKS?

12:28.181 --> 12:31.218
Manhattan Killer Squad.
A violent drug gang.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.519
Well, we have
two homicides.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.888
The perp painted "killer"
on the side of the wall.

12:34.922 --> 12:37.090
MKS ever use that
as their tag?

12:37.124 --> 12:38.859
Not that I've seen,
but it's possible.

12:38.892 --> 12:39.993
These kids are savages.

12:40.027 --> 12:42.095
Into crystal meth?
Big time.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.396
They killed their way
into control

12:43.430 --> 12:44.832
of a big chunk
of the market.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.266
Cooking it?
Heisting it.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.568
They look for gay men
who are heavy users,

12:48.601 --> 12:50.503
beat them half to death,
steal their drugs,

12:50.537 --> 12:52.272
then they sell it
back to gay dealers.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.407
So a circuit party's like
one-stop shopping.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.542
Users and dealers.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.310
Got anybody inside MKS?

12:57.344 --> 13:00.247
Had an informant.
Surfaced in the East River.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.382
Haven't found the right
replacement for him yet.

13:02.415 --> 13:05.052
MKS crew's mostly young, white
psychos from the 'burbs.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.586
Psycho enough
to kill a dealer?

13:06.619 --> 13:07.855
Oh, I wouldn't
put it past them.

13:07.888 --> 13:10.023
If MKS hit your victim,

13:10.057 --> 13:11.424
there'll be chatter
on the circuit.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.860
Gay kids in the club scene

13:12.893 --> 13:15.963
know what's going on.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.164
(Benson)
Thank you for meeting me.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.466
You carrying water
for my father?

13:19.499 --> 13:22.502
Nope.
He doesn't know that I'm here.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.104
We're working on a homicide

13:24.137 --> 13:27.307
that may be connected
to circuit parties.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.376
So let's talk
to the token gay guy?

13:29.409 --> 13:32.412
What do you want?

13:34.314 --> 13:36.349
You ever hear of MKS?

13:36.383 --> 13:38.385
Bunch of little freaks
from the Island.

13:38.418 --> 13:41.054
They hit the clubs,
act like they're into the scene.

13:41.088 --> 13:42.589
But they're not gay.

13:42.622 --> 13:45.625
More like fag bashers.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.494
MKS kid goes into the party,

13:47.527 --> 13:51.298
spots a guy holding meth,
lures him outside.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.133
Where the rest of his crew
is waiting to roll him?

13:53.166 --> 13:56.536
They beat the crap out of him,
take his stash.

13:56.569 --> 13:58.405
Have you ever been hurt?

13:58.438 --> 14:00.607
I'm not into meth.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.543
Fin probably thinks I am.
Another reason to hate me.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.078
Your dad doesn't hate you.

14:05.112 --> 14:08.048
My dad doesn't know me.

14:08.081 --> 14:11.018
Why don't you give him
some time?

14:11.051 --> 14:13.954
Look, you wanna know
about MKS?

14:13.987 --> 14:16.656
There's a party tonight
at a club called Euphoria.

14:16.689 --> 14:20.260
Lot of people'll be tweaking,
dealers will be there.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.129
[crowd chanting]
Meth equals death!

14:22.162 --> 14:23.997
Meth equals death!

14:24.031 --> 14:26.033
Meth equals death!

14:26.066 --> 14:27.534
Meth equals death!

14:27.567 --> 14:29.136
Meth equals death!

14:29.169 --> 14:30.603
What's happening up there?

14:30.637 --> 14:34.474
Some kind of protest.

14:34.507 --> 14:37.310
(Cragen)
Those guys don't look
like MKS.

14:37.344 --> 14:40.047
(Fin)
Ain't nothing going down
with all this drama out here.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.448
Club must have the same idea.

14:41.481 --> 14:42.916
They're opening
the rear fire door

14:42.950 --> 14:45.919
so people don't have
to go through the protest.

14:45.953 --> 14:48.655
[man over radio]
Captain, check out the guy
in the white shirt.

14:48.688 --> 14:50.690
Meth equals death.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.292
Meth equals death.

14:52.325 --> 14:55.428
Hey, play it safe.
Use protection.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.630
Go away, man.
Leave me alone.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.936
Hey, sweetheart.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.637
You lonely tonight?

15:04.671 --> 15:06.974
Your 12 o'clock,
there's a skinny kid

15:07.007 --> 15:09.076
black shirt,
blue jeans

15:09.109 --> 15:10.610
hustling a guy
in a gray sweater.

15:10.643 --> 15:12.445
Looks like
he could be MKS.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.614
Could be just going
for a quickie.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.318
Fin, check 'em out.

15:18.351 --> 15:22.489
[men shouting]

15:22.522 --> 15:23.656
You like that?

15:23.690 --> 15:25.325
It's going down.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.427
All units hit Cortland Alley.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.232
[siren wails]
Police!

15:32.265 --> 15:34.467
(male officer)
Stay where you are.

15:34.501 --> 15:37.037
Don't move.
Get down, get down!

15:39.539 --> 15:41.341
(officer)
Let me see your hands.

15:43.376 --> 15:44.511
Don't move.
Get on the ground.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.980
Cuff him.

15:47.014 --> 15:49.316
Let's go.

15:49.349 --> 15:50.650
Captain.

15:51.751 --> 15:54.054
Check that out.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.389
"Killer."

15:58.625 --> 16:00.160
(Fin)
Hey, Killer.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.162
You get that tattoo
for offing somebody?

16:02.195 --> 16:03.330
It's my posse.

16:03.363 --> 16:04.697
Manhattan Killer Squad.

16:04.731 --> 16:05.765
They call you "Killer"?

16:05.798 --> 16:07.234
No.
King Henry.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.201
King of what?

16:08.235 --> 16:09.569
(Benson)
Garden City, Long Island?

16:09.602 --> 16:12.439
Hmm?

16:12.472 --> 16:13.706
Henry Fanello.

16:13.740 --> 16:17.610
Possession Seven,
Grand Theft Auto, Assault.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.546
Oh, just turned
18 three weeks ago.

16:19.579 --> 16:20.747
(Fin)
Happy birthday.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.315
You're an adult.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.551
No more calling Daddy.
No more juvie time.

16:24.584 --> 16:27.154
I'll make bail before that
faggot gets out of the hospital.

16:27.187 --> 16:28.421
Who's calling who
a faggot?

16:28.455 --> 16:31.024
Your gaydar must be jammed.

16:31.058 --> 16:32.559
Yeah, or maybe you're just
too scared to come out.

16:32.592 --> 16:33.593
I'm not queer.

16:33.626 --> 16:35.062
(Fin)
You're on the circuit.

16:35.095 --> 16:37.397
That is, until we put you
in jail for murder.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.432
Murder?

16:39.466 --> 16:40.433
Yo, I never saw them.

16:40.467 --> 16:41.601
(Fin)
Yes, you did.

16:41.634 --> 16:43.136
And you killed 'em.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.071
And you wrote your name
right there.

16:44.104 --> 16:44.704
You think I whacked
those fags?

16:44.737 --> 16:47.774
I ripped 'em off, that's it.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.742
Why do you target gay men?

16:49.776 --> 16:51.811
They're easy marks.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.480
Don't call the cops
when they get jumped.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.248
Don't want anyone to know
about their freaky sex lives

16:55.282 --> 16:56.583
and their meth jones.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.285
Killer.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.220
Your tag,
your crime.
I swear.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.721
I didn't do it.
I didn't kill no one.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.423
[knocking at door]

17:03.456 --> 17:05.492
Can I talk to you two
for a minute?

17:10.530 --> 17:11.831
I think I know
what "Killer" means.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.500
Yeah, him.

17:13.533 --> 17:14.834
Doc doesn't think so.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.137
Lydon Grant had AIDS,
just like Robin Weller.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.372
Well, that's not a surprise.
They were lovers.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.808
They both had
the same strain of HIV.

17:21.841 --> 17:23.176
The so-called
killer strain.

17:23.210 --> 17:26.146
Progresses from infection
to death

17:26.179 --> 17:28.115
in less than a year,
resistant to most drugs.

17:28.148 --> 17:30.083
First time I've ever seen it.

17:30.117 --> 17:32.219
If Robin or Lydon had
unprotected sex

17:32.252 --> 17:34.421
with anyone else, they could've
infected their partners.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.356
Making them both killers.

17:42.129 --> 17:43.563
(Cragen)
Well, this could be revenge.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.465
Somebody who knew
both Robin and Lydon

17:45.498 --> 17:47.300
had the new strain of HIV.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.369
Maybe a sexual partner
one of them infected.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.838
Or a vigilante
wiping out HIV victims.

17:51.871 --> 17:55.142
Specifically crystal meth users
who are gay.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.443
The whole country's
swimming in crank.

17:56.476 --> 17:57.477
Why just kill gay men?

17:57.510 --> 17:58.478
Because after years

17:58.511 --> 18:00.213
of keeping HIV in check,

18:00.247 --> 18:02.282
meth is causing an increase
in new infections,

18:02.315 --> 18:04.217
especially among gay men
in the club scene.

18:04.251 --> 18:06.419
They call it "PNP"--
Party-N-Play.

18:06.453 --> 18:07.620
(Benson)
When you're tweaking on meth,

18:07.654 --> 18:09.389
you can have sex for hours.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.191
But you're high, so you're not
likely to use a condom.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.193
And much more likely
to spread HIV.

18:13.226 --> 18:14.694
(Fin)
Then why'd the perp trick
out the victims?

18:14.727 --> 18:16.329
That just calls more attention
to himself.

18:16.363 --> 18:17.797
(Huang)
The guy's desperate.

18:17.830 --> 18:19.832
He wants people to wake up,
to pay attention to the danger.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.168
(Benson)
But how did

18:21.201 --> 18:23.636
our perp know that Lydon
and Robin had HIV?

18:23.670 --> 18:25.272
I mean, this is not something
that you advertise.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.274
It had to be a mutual friend

18:27.307 --> 18:29.309
or someone like a doctor
or health care worker

18:29.342 --> 18:31.378
who knew
they were both infected.

18:31.411 --> 18:32.679
As soon as
they tested positive,

18:32.712 --> 18:33.913
they'd have to submit a list
of their sexual contacts

18:33.946 --> 18:35.482
to the Health Department.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.321
(man)
I can't discuss anyone's
HIV status.

18:41.354 --> 18:42.622
Not a discussion,
it's a homicide investigation.

18:42.655 --> 18:43.823
Department policy.

18:43.856 --> 18:46.293
Look, sir, someone
in this office

18:46.326 --> 18:47.927
could be killing people
with AIDS.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.729
You don't help us,
we subpoena your records

18:49.762 --> 18:51.864
and bust you for obstruction.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.369
Look, you didn't hear this
from me.

18:56.403 --> 18:57.704
They said don't talk
about it.

18:57.737 --> 18:58.871
Don't talk
about what?

19:08.715 --> 19:10.383
Our computers were hacked.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.685
Somebody got the names
of people with HIV?

19:12.719 --> 19:13.486
It happened
in Florida too.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.355
Well, shouldn't you tell
the public?

19:15.388 --> 19:16.656
Our files are encrypted.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.358
Hacker won't be able
to read the list.

19:18.391 --> 19:19.459
We need those names.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.228
We're reconstructing
the files.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.695
They were damaged
when he copied them.

19:22.729 --> 19:23.730
(Benson)
He?

19:23.763 --> 19:25.898
You know who did this.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.934
We can't prove it,
but our overnight supervisor

19:27.967 --> 19:29.769
caught a janitor sitting
at a computer terminal.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.738
What's the janitor's name?

19:31.771 --> 19:34.607
Gabriel Thomason.
We fired him.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.276
You wouldn't happen
to know where he lives.

19:36.309 --> 19:39.346
No, but I can tell you
where he spends his time.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.713
Wouldn't stop talking
about some AIDS group

19:40.747 --> 19:43.216
called The Rainbow Army.

19:43.250 --> 19:46.453
(Fin)
We're looking
for Gabriel Thomason.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.521
Hey, Gabe!

19:48.555 --> 19:51.258
Got some folks here
to see you.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.959
I'm Gabriel Thomason,
can I help you?

19:52.992 --> 19:55.295
Detective Benson,
Tutuola.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.930
Saw you last night
at Club Euphoria.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.666
I had a permit
for the protest.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.434
Yeah?
Where'd you go afterwards?

20:01.468 --> 20:04.604
I, uh, hit a couple of clubs
to look for condoms.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.573
What's the matter
with the drug store?

20:06.606 --> 20:09.842
I was checking
on their supply.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.844
There was a time when

20:11.878 --> 20:13.913
all the clubs had bowls
of free condoms.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.482
So now you run
the condom patrol,

20:15.515 --> 20:17.550
since you got fired
from your janitor gig.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.852
That was a misunderstanding.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.488
(Fin)
We heard

20:21.521 --> 20:23.356
you hacked the Health
Department's computers.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.424
Yeah, what were you
looking for?

20:24.457 --> 20:26.593
Uh, actually,
I was checking my e-mail.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.761
It's typical.

20:28.795 --> 20:32.965
They have a problem, blame it
on the faggot janitor.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.003
He's gonna stick
to that story,

20:37.036 --> 20:38.305
and we can't prove
otherwise.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.639
He knows we can't nail him.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.874
I bet my paycheck
he got that list.

20:41.908 --> 20:42.975
Maybe we should
talk to somebody

20:43.009 --> 20:44.444
at the Gay Officer's League.

20:44.477 --> 20:46.813
Have a cop go undercover
inside the Rainbow Army.

20:46.846 --> 20:49.316
Gabriel's already raised up.
He smelled a rat.

20:49.349 --> 20:51.017
So where to next?

20:51.050 --> 20:52.652
I'm gonna drop you off
at the squad.

20:52.685 --> 20:53.620
I got a stop to make.

20:53.653 --> 20:54.687
Informant?

20:54.721 --> 20:56.656
Maybe.

20:58.458 --> 20:59.726
Gotta go, Dad.

20:59.759 --> 21:00.927
I just need a minute.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.595
I made enough mistakes
with you already.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.331
I'm not trying
to do it again.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.599
Come on, man, I'm working
on a case.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.335
Is it the one
Olivia told me about

21:08.368 --> 21:09.702
with the circuit parties?

21:09.736 --> 21:11.404
She talked to you?

21:11.438 --> 21:14.507
Yeah.
About MKS.

21:14.541 --> 21:16.709
Okay, I wanna show you
a picture of a dead guy.

21:16.743 --> 21:17.744
Can I do that?

21:17.777 --> 21:20.913
Yeah.

21:20.947 --> 21:25.017
Why "Killer"?

21:25.051 --> 21:27.420
The victim had a new
killer strain of HIV.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.489
You can't scare me
out of being gay.

21:29.522 --> 21:30.990
I'm not trying to.

21:31.023 --> 21:33.493
Then why ask me
about this case?

21:33.526 --> 21:36.329
Okay, this guy was murdered
after he came out

21:36.363 --> 21:37.697
of the Green Ballroom Club
the night

21:37.730 --> 21:39.098
you were there.

21:39.131 --> 21:42.435
That's how you found
out about me.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.737
It's all over the circuit
about these two guys.

21:44.771 --> 21:45.972
I heard about this.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.908
You ever heard about
the Rainbow Army?

21:48.941 --> 21:50.377
See their flyers everywhere.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.011
They do good work.

21:52.044 --> 21:53.746
You think they're involved?

21:53.780 --> 21:55.548
It's possible.

21:55.582 --> 21:57.850
I mean, they're trying to help
gay men, not kill them.

21:57.884 --> 21:59.886
Well, somebody is killing
these guys,

21:59.919 --> 22:01.421
and if we don't find him,
I guarantee you

22:01.454 --> 22:02.989
he's gonna kill more.

22:03.022 --> 22:05.458
And you're telling me this
because I'm gay

22:05.492 --> 22:06.559
and you want me
to be careful?

22:06.593 --> 22:07.960
Yes.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.363
And I also need a favor.

22:10.397 --> 22:11.998
Okay.

22:12.031 --> 22:14.401
You still majoring
in computer science?

22:18.137 --> 22:20.006
(Ken)
You know, I don't have
classes on Tuesday.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.408
I could come every week.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.643
Good. We do a lot
of demonstrations.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.545
Are your parents gonna have
a problem if you get arrested?

22:25.578 --> 22:26.679
Oh, they'd be proud of me.

22:26.713 --> 22:27.814
[laughter]

22:27.847 --> 22:30.450
This one dude, his family could
deal with him being gay,

22:30.483 --> 22:32.452
but they hated it when he
wound up in the papers.

22:32.485 --> 22:34.020
"You gotta be
so public about it?

22:34.053 --> 22:35.988
The whole world's gotta know?"

22:36.022 --> 22:37.624
(Ken)
Right, what will
the neighbors think?

22:37.657 --> 22:39.659
(Benson)
Hey, how's it going?

22:39.692 --> 22:42.395
The glasses cam works great.

22:42.429 --> 22:44.597
Who's Ken talking to?

22:44.631 --> 22:47.800
His name's Jason.
Office manager.

22:47.834 --> 22:49.602
Hey, Gabriel.
Hi, Jas.

22:49.636 --> 22:51.103
This your man?
Yeah.

22:51.137 --> 22:52.004
Ken Randall,
Gabriel Thomason.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.440
There's our friend.

22:53.473 --> 22:54.941
(Gabriel)
Jas told me all about ya.

22:54.974 --> 22:55.908
(Ken)
Not much to tell.

22:55.942 --> 22:56.943
Well, we're glad to have you.

22:56.976 --> 22:58.144
You know, we, uh, we need
all the help we can get.

22:58.177 --> 23:01.714
(Ken)
Seeing guys get sick,
being stupid

23:01.748 --> 23:02.949
makes me want
to do something.

23:02.982 --> 23:04.551
Cool. You wanna come
inside for a sec?

23:04.584 --> 23:05.818
Sure.
You good?

23:05.852 --> 23:08.721
(Jason)
Yeah.

23:08.755 --> 23:11.157
So Jason tells me
you're a computer science major.

23:11.190 --> 23:13.493
Thinking about
software engineering.

23:13.526 --> 23:15.528
Unless I go premed.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.196
But you're good
with computers.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.998
That's what
my professors say.

23:19.031 --> 23:20.099
Your fish just bit
the hook.

23:20.132 --> 23:21.468
(Fin)
Not yet.

23:21.501 --> 23:23.536
He's still sniffing the bait.

23:23.570 --> 23:24.571
From one computer
to another, so--

23:24.604 --> 23:25.905
(Ken)
I could teach you.

23:25.938 --> 23:29.108
I want to help out.
I think you guys do great work.

23:29.141 --> 23:33.179
Good.
Well, actually, um...

23:33.212 --> 23:34.781
I got a little
software problem.

23:34.814 --> 23:36.182
(Ken)
What kind?

23:36.215 --> 23:37.784
(Gabriel)
It's a file I can't open.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.519
Come to you by e-mail?

23:39.552 --> 23:41.120
It's, uh,
it's on a disk.

23:41.153 --> 23:43.122
From a different
operating system?

23:43.155 --> 23:45.992
You lost me.

23:46.025 --> 23:47.627
Windows, Mac, Unix--

23:47.660 --> 23:50.162
you go from one to another,
stuff gets garbled.

23:50.196 --> 23:51.631
Well, if I just
give you the disk,

23:51.664 --> 23:53.032
do you think
you can open it?

23:53.065 --> 23:54.634
I'll try.

23:58.170 --> 24:01.207
There you go.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.909
There's a better chance
I'll be able

24:02.942 --> 24:04.076
to open this
on my setup at home.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.077
All right,

24:05.111 --> 24:06.513
well, just, uh,

24:06.546 --> 24:08.881
take it and make sure
I get it back.

24:08.915 --> 24:09.882
What's the file
you need opened?

24:09.916 --> 24:11.117
It's a list of names.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.151
Got him.

24:15.955 --> 24:18.491
(Suarto)
Theoretically, encryption's
built into a system

24:18.525 --> 24:21.728
with its own encoding key,
but Gabriel corrupted the file.

24:21.761 --> 24:23.896
When it wouldn't open,
he saved it in another format.

24:23.930 --> 24:25.264
Is it compressed?

24:25.297 --> 24:27.266
I don't think so.

24:27.299 --> 24:31.638
Maybe it's a UUE extension
or something like that.

24:31.671 --> 24:32.672
I'll try that.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.848
(Ken)
There you go.
What do you think, Dad?

24:41.881 --> 24:43.516
Not bad, huh?

24:45.752 --> 24:47.854
That looks like our list.

24:47.887 --> 24:50.823
(Cragen)
Gabriel needs the list--why?

24:50.857 --> 24:52.124
To warn men or to kill them?

24:52.158 --> 24:53.660
Well, if he wants to stop

24:53.693 --> 24:55.161
the spread of the killer
HIV strain,

24:55.194 --> 24:56.763
he might kill anyone
who's infected.

24:56.796 --> 24:58.998
Then we canvass everybody
on that list

24:59.031 --> 25:00.833
and anybody who slept
with Lydon Grant

25:00.867 --> 25:01.834
or Robin Weller.

25:01.868 --> 25:03.269
(Fin)
Wait a minute.

25:03.302 --> 25:05.204
Gabriel's last name
is Thomason.

25:05.237 --> 25:06.806
One of the names
on Robin's list

25:06.839 --> 25:08.908
is Alexander Thomason,
age 23.

25:11.644 --> 25:13.613
Died three months ago.

25:13.646 --> 25:15.314
Before that, he lived at

25:15.347 --> 25:17.584
458 West 10th Street,
apartment 3B.

25:17.617 --> 25:19.018
(Benson)
That's Gabriel's address.

25:19.051 --> 25:23.022
Alex Thomason
is his younger brother.

25:23.055 --> 25:25.057
I know a couple of families
with two gay kids.

25:25.091 --> 25:27.126
If Alex and Gabriel
were close...

25:27.159 --> 25:30.129
Gives Gabriel mondo motive
to murder Lydon and Robin.

25:30.162 --> 25:32.632
And let the whole world
know they were "killers".

25:32.665 --> 25:34.100
But why
the Health Department list?

25:34.133 --> 25:35.768
He already avenged
his brother's death.

25:35.802 --> 25:38.104
Gabriel wanted to know
who infected Lydon.

25:38.137 --> 25:40.172
It's a chain.

25:40.206 --> 25:43.309
He's working his way
backwards.

25:43.342 --> 25:44.844
(Cragen)
Go pick Gabriel up

25:44.877 --> 25:46.746
before he finds
his next victim.

25:46.779 --> 25:48.347
[men chanting]
Meth equals death!

25:48.380 --> 25:50.717
Meth equals death!

25:50.750 --> 25:52.151
Meth equals death!

25:52.184 --> 25:54.053
Meth equals death!

25:54.086 --> 25:55.922
Meth equals death!

25:55.955 --> 25:57.857
Meth equals death!

25:57.890 --> 25:59.726
Meth equals death!

25:59.759 --> 26:00.693
Meth equals death!

26:00.727 --> 26:02.294
Gabriel Thomason.

26:02.328 --> 26:04.363
Uh...

26:04.396 --> 26:05.297
We're busy, detectives.

26:05.331 --> 26:06.899
I can speak with you
at the office tomorrow.

26:06.933 --> 26:08.901
Put the sign down, please.

26:08.935 --> 26:11.303
This is a peaceful protest,
but she's gonna arrest me.

26:11.337 --> 26:12.805
And what are the charges?

26:12.839 --> 26:14.040
Loitering while gay?

26:14.073 --> 26:15.608
No.
Homicide.

26:15.642 --> 26:16.909
Gabriel Thomason,

26:16.943 --> 26:18.645
you are under arrest
for the murders

26:18.678 --> 26:20.780
of Robin Weller
and Lydon Grant.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.081
You have the right
to remain silent.

26:22.114 --> 26:24.183
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

26:24.216 --> 26:25.652
in a court of law.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.657
I admit it.

26:30.690 --> 26:33.225
I killed Robin and Lydon.

26:33.259 --> 26:34.961
But what are two lives
compared to the thousands

26:34.994 --> 26:36.863
that could be lost if the super
strain becomes an epidemic?

26:36.896 --> 26:38.998
So you're confessing
to murder?

26:39.031 --> 26:40.667
What choice did I have?

26:40.700 --> 26:42.702
They're high on meth,
having sex with each other

26:42.735 --> 26:43.836
night after night,
exposing their partners,

26:43.870 --> 26:45.672
who would infect
their next partners.

26:45.705 --> 26:46.973
Just like they infected
your brother.

26:52.912 --> 26:55.982
Alex always used a condom.

26:56.015 --> 26:58.117
Got tested regularly.

26:58.150 --> 26:59.418
Until Robin Weller

26:59.451 --> 27:02.121
got him hooked
on crystal meth.

27:02.154 --> 27:06.659
I saw Robin
at the club that night.

27:06.693 --> 27:10.262
He was so high,
he didn't remember me.

27:10.296 --> 27:12.732
I came onto him.

27:12.765 --> 27:15.034
He took me back
to the shoe store, he was...

27:15.067 --> 27:18.070
expecting sex.

27:18.104 --> 27:20.306
He killed my brother.
I killed him.

27:20.339 --> 27:22.274
(Fin)
So you play God?

27:22.308 --> 27:24.143
Decide who lives
and who dies?

27:24.176 --> 27:26.979
It's called
a Messiah Complex.

27:27.013 --> 27:28.815
Gabriel believes
that he can see things

27:28.848 --> 27:31.050
no one else can see,
like a prophet.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.685
So he's insane.

27:32.719 --> 27:34.086
No, he knows
that it's wrong to kill.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.155
He just feels justified
in his actions.

27:36.188 --> 27:38.224
Then why was he so careful
not to get caught?

27:38.257 --> 27:39.992
Because he still
has work to do.

27:40.026 --> 27:42.461
Killing for the cause.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.296
He believes
in what he's doing.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.798
That's why he confessed.

27:45.832 --> 27:46.966
Yeah, and the defense
will argue

27:46.999 --> 27:48.735
extreme
emotional disturbance.

27:48.768 --> 27:50.236
Gabriel was driven
temporarily insane

27:50.269 --> 27:51.904
by grief over
his brother's death.

27:51.938 --> 27:53.305
(Maddox)
You really think
I'm that predictable,

27:53.339 --> 27:54.741
Casey?

27:54.774 --> 27:56.108
(Novak)
Well, you're too late, Carolyn.

27:56.142 --> 27:57.109
Your client gave it up.

27:57.143 --> 27:59.045
Did he?
Mm-hmm.

27:59.078 --> 28:00.146
Doesn't matter.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.048
Gabriel won't serve
a day in prison.

28:02.081 --> 28:04.283
How you gonna pull
that off?

28:04.316 --> 28:07.053
You really expect me
to give you all my secrets?

28:07.086 --> 28:08.855
See you at arraignment.

28:12.859 --> 28:13.893
(clerk)
Docket ending 497.

28:13.926 --> 28:16.195
We'll hear a plea,
Ms. Maddox.

28:16.228 --> 28:17.964
Not guilty.

28:17.997 --> 28:20.066
The defense can't argue
diminished capacity.

28:20.099 --> 28:23.135
Gabriel Thomason clearly stated
in his confession

28:23.169 --> 28:24.837
that he knew what he was doing,
and he knew it was wrong.

28:24.871 --> 28:25.905
(Maddox)
We're not arguing EED.

28:25.938 --> 28:28.174
Your honor, the plea
is self-defense

28:28.207 --> 28:31.343
under the accepted theories
of "imminent harm"

28:31.377 --> 28:32.478
and "greater danger".
Self-defense?

28:32.511 --> 28:34.446
Robin Weller
was tied to a chair

28:34.480 --> 28:35.748
and shot point blank
in the head.

28:35.782 --> 28:36.849
How could he have posed

28:36.883 --> 28:38.217
a risk
to Gabriel Thomason?

28:38.250 --> 28:39.786
(Maddox)
Robin Weller and Lydon Grant

28:39.819 --> 28:41.420
were the carriers
of a lethal virus.

28:41.453 --> 28:42.388
But Gabriel wasn't having sex
with them.

28:42.421 --> 28:43.756
He was never in danger.

28:43.790 --> 28:45.357
(Maddox)
Two men with HIV

28:45.391 --> 28:46.893
having drug-fueled,

28:46.926 --> 28:50.096
compulsive sex puts
other gay men in danger.

28:50.129 --> 28:51.330
My client was defending

28:51.363 --> 28:53.800
the entire gay community
from two men

28:53.833 --> 28:55.802
whose sexual behavior
threatened thousands.

28:55.835 --> 28:57.870
Your Honor, this is ludicrous.

28:57.904 --> 29:00.172
It's an interesting argument.

29:00.206 --> 29:03.209
I'm not sure it'll work,
but the jury should hear it.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.777
I'm going to allow
the defense.

29:08.247 --> 29:09.882
(Sloan)
At the Centers
for Disease Control,

29:09.916 --> 29:12.218
we monitor HIV
exposure patterns.

29:12.251 --> 29:15.054
Then you must be very concerned
about this new strain

29:15.087 --> 29:16.355
of HIV.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.357
It may be more lethal
than anything we've seen

29:18.390 --> 29:20.827
in the history
of this epidemic.

29:20.860 --> 29:23.095
What does the CDC
recommend we do?

29:23.129 --> 29:26.332
Notify the public,
increase education,

29:26.365 --> 29:28.067
and preventive measures.

29:28.100 --> 29:31.303
Some people are proposing more
radical solutions.

29:31.337 --> 29:32.304
Like what?

29:32.338 --> 29:33.873
Prosecuting people

29:33.906 --> 29:35.207
who knowingly
infect their partners

29:35.241 --> 29:37.109
or making them

29:37.143 --> 29:39.311
bear a part of the cost
of their medical treatment.

29:39.345 --> 29:42.248
(Novak)
How about killing people
who have the virus?

29:42.281 --> 29:43.549
(Sloan)
Certainly not.

29:43.582 --> 29:46.518
Killing is obviously
not the answer.

29:46.552 --> 29:49.188
Thank you.

29:49.221 --> 29:52.892
Your witness.

29:52.925 --> 29:56.028
Dr. Sloan, is there
any treatment

29:56.062 --> 29:57.363
for this new strain of HIV?

29:57.396 --> 29:59.465
It's resistant to most

29:59.498 --> 30:00.867
drug therapies.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.835
We're trying
to develop new treatments.

30:02.869 --> 30:05.004
The virus has mutated,

30:05.037 --> 30:06.438
changed to fight off
our attempts

30:06.472 --> 30:08.174
to kill it.

30:08.207 --> 30:11.310
If it spreads further,
we may not be able to stop it.

30:11.343 --> 30:13.045
Ever.

30:13.079 --> 30:15.314
So you're saying those infected
will die quickly.

30:15.347 --> 30:17.116
Yes.

30:17.149 --> 30:19.518
I believe we might be
on the verge of a disaster,

30:19.551 --> 30:22.088
a new worldwide pandemic.

30:22.121 --> 30:24.123
(Maddox)
What can we do--
test everyone and

30:24.156 --> 30:26.625
quarantine those with HIV
to a desert island?

30:26.658 --> 30:29.261
Back in the '90s, the New York
City Health Department

30:29.295 --> 30:31.964
established detention centers
for people with TB

30:31.998 --> 30:34.066
who refused to take
their medicine.

30:34.100 --> 30:35.868
Sounds like a good way
to protect the public.

30:35.902 --> 30:37.469
Why haven't you tried that?

30:37.503 --> 30:41.507
The law doesn't allow us
to quarantine people with HIV.

30:41.540 --> 30:44.243
So those infected
with this new strain

30:44.276 --> 30:46.378
can keep on having
unprotected sex

30:46.412 --> 30:48.380
and spreading this virus?

30:48.414 --> 30:52.351
Yes.
We have no way to stop them.

30:52.384 --> 30:54.486
Thank you.

30:58.657 --> 30:59.926
(Gabriel)
Well, I came of age

30:59.959 --> 31:03.062
hearing about how
so many gay men died

31:03.095 --> 31:06.198
in the '80s,
when there was no treatment.

31:06.232 --> 31:09.335
And now it's happening again
because of crystal meth.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.270
How does that make you feel?

31:11.303 --> 31:13.105
Lonely.

31:13.139 --> 31:16.175
Afraid.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.244
Hopeless.

31:18.277 --> 31:20.579
(Maddox)
How do you deal with that?

31:20.612 --> 31:23.115
(Gabriel)
By trying to make a difference.

31:23.149 --> 31:26.452
Teaching young gay men
to protect themselves.

31:26.485 --> 31:27.987
I joined the Rainbow Army

31:28.020 --> 31:29.388
to bring the message
to the circuit.

31:29.421 --> 31:31.657
Have your efforts
been successful?

31:35.962 --> 31:38.064
I couldn't save
my own brother.

31:41.167 --> 31:44.536
Alex tested positive
last year, and...

31:44.570 --> 31:47.006
And he died five months later.

31:50.176 --> 31:52.244
After the funeral,
I read his diaries,

31:52.278 --> 31:53.679
I made a list of the people
that he slept with.

31:53.712 --> 31:56.215
Why?

31:56.248 --> 31:58.417
So I could tell them
to be tested.

31:58.450 --> 32:02.588
Was Robin Weller one of the men
you talked to?

32:02.621 --> 32:04.723
Yes.

32:04.756 --> 32:08.294
And he--he told me he had
the killer strain too.

32:08.327 --> 32:11.097
That it was positive before he
had sex with my brother--

32:11.130 --> 32:14.433
That he knew,
he didn't tell Alex--

32:14.466 --> 32:16.268
And he infected him.

32:16.302 --> 32:17.636
And that made you angry.

32:17.669 --> 32:19.538
Yes.

32:19.571 --> 32:20.639
And then I saw Robin

32:20.672 --> 32:24.743
at the clubs,
picking up young guys.

32:24.776 --> 32:27.346
I tried to warn them,
but they were high on meth.

32:27.379 --> 32:29.748
They wouldn't listen.

32:29.781 --> 32:32.284
I couldn't save them.

32:32.318 --> 32:36.022
Robin was gonna murder them.

32:36.055 --> 32:38.557
Just like he murdered
my brother.

32:38.590 --> 32:40.159
(Maddox)
And that's why you killed

32:40.192 --> 32:42.694
the two men responsible
for Alex's death.

32:42.728 --> 32:44.596
I had to protect the other men
they would've infected

32:44.630 --> 32:46.532
and all the men
they would've infected.

32:46.565 --> 32:50.369
Gabriel, do you think
you did the right thing?

32:50.402 --> 32:53.172
I do.

32:53.205 --> 32:56.408
By stopping two lives,
I saved thousands more.

32:56.442 --> 32:59.711
(Maddox)
Thank you.

33:06.585 --> 33:09.188
"Stopping two lives."

33:09.221 --> 33:12.658
That's some pretty fancy
gift wrapping.

33:12.691 --> 33:15.727
You murdered two men,
didn't you?

33:15.761 --> 33:19.298
Yes.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.600
But they could've murdered
thousands of innocent others.

33:21.633 --> 33:24.136
Like your brother.

33:24.170 --> 33:26.172
You think Alex
was innocent?

33:26.205 --> 33:28.340
Of course.

33:28.374 --> 33:30.176
(Novak)
Your brother wasn't raped.

33:30.209 --> 33:33.545
He chose to have sex
without a condom.

33:33.579 --> 33:35.781
You're blaming him?

33:35.814 --> 33:37.283
You heard Dr. Sloan

33:37.316 --> 33:40.552
testify about the need
for personal responsibility.

33:40.586 --> 33:43.189
Robin Weller
wasn't behaving responsibly.

33:43.222 --> 33:45.624
But neither was your brother.

33:45.657 --> 33:46.758
(Gabriel)
Well, Alex--Alex

33:46.792 --> 33:48.760
didn't know any better.

33:48.794 --> 33:50.662
He was young,
he was high--

33:50.696 --> 33:52.531
So was Robin Weller.

33:52.564 --> 33:56.135
You blame one,
you blame both.

33:56.168 --> 33:57.603
And what if Alex
hadn't died?

33:57.636 --> 34:01.240
What if he'd gone on
using meth and partying?

34:01.273 --> 34:03.842
He could've infected others.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.312
Would you have
"stopped" his life?

34:13.852 --> 34:16.455
Answer the question.

34:16.488 --> 34:18.590
Would you have killed
your own brother?

34:39.611 --> 34:40.846
(Maddox)
There are no mysteries here.

34:40.879 --> 34:42.314
Two people are dead.

34:42.348 --> 34:44.383
Gabriel Thomason has told you

34:44.416 --> 34:46.652
that he shot
and killed them both.

34:46.685 --> 34:49.455
And why he did it.

34:49.488 --> 34:54.693
In 1981, 41 gay men
were diagnosed

34:54.726 --> 34:56.362
with a rare form of cancer

34:56.395 --> 34:58.497
no doctors had
ever seen before.

34:58.530 --> 35:01.900
Now 40 million people
are infected with HIV.

35:01.933 --> 35:05.171
40 million.

35:05.204 --> 35:07.306
Gay and straight.

35:07.339 --> 35:11.310
And we keep hoping that
they'll do something about it

35:11.343 --> 35:13.712
before it's too late,
and no one does.

35:13.745 --> 35:16.682
That's why Gabriel Thomason
took matters

35:16.715 --> 35:18.917
into his own hands.

35:18.950 --> 35:23.289
Robin Weller and Lydon Grant
infected

35:23.322 --> 35:25.791
dozens of men.

35:25.824 --> 35:27.493
And could've infected hundreds

35:27.526 --> 35:30.896
if their drug and sex binge
continued.

35:30.929 --> 35:32.731
They were terrorists.

35:32.764 --> 35:35.667
Let me put it
to you this way.

35:35.701 --> 35:39.638
You walk out of there tonight,
and on the courthouse steps

35:39.671 --> 35:42.308
is Osama Bin Laden
holding a dirty bomb.

35:42.341 --> 35:44.676
Everything you know
about this man tells you

35:44.710 --> 35:46.878
that he will detonate it
and turn Manhattan

35:46.912 --> 35:48.614
into a nuclear wasteland.

35:48.647 --> 35:50.482
You've got a gun.

35:50.516 --> 35:54.620
Would you shoot him
to save the city?

35:54.653 --> 35:56.488
Desperate times require
desperate measures.

35:56.522 --> 35:58.857
Gabriel Thomason did
what he had to do

35:58.890 --> 36:01.493
to save innocent lives.

36:01.527 --> 36:04.796
Now it's your turn.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.399
Do what you have to do.

36:07.433 --> 36:10.369
Find him not guilty.

36:17.709 --> 36:21.480
Millions dying of AIDS
is an unimaginable tragedy.

36:21.513 --> 36:23.582
But does that mean
that two more deaths,

36:23.615 --> 36:28.454
two murders don't matter?

36:28.487 --> 36:31.323
The defense argues that these
murders were justifiable,

36:31.357 --> 36:32.858
because they prevented
future deaths.

36:32.891 --> 36:38.264
It might sound rational.
But consider this.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.999
Tobacco executives--
they make cigarettes.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.902
And hundreds of thousands
of people who smoke

36:43.935 --> 36:46.272
die of lung cancer.

36:46.305 --> 36:49.441
Would it be all right
to murder the tobacco CEOs?

36:49.475 --> 36:51.343
If you think
the two situations

36:51.377 --> 36:53.579
aren't the same,
think again.

36:53.612 --> 36:56.648
People who smoke--
they know the risks.

36:56.682 --> 36:59.951
And they choose to smoke
despite them.

36:59.985 --> 37:03.422
Just like people
who choose to get high

37:03.455 --> 37:05.624
and have sex
without a condom.

37:05.657 --> 37:08.394
So don't blame the victims.

37:08.427 --> 37:10.996
Gabriel Thomason broke the law.

37:11.029 --> 37:14.300
He killed two men.

37:14.333 --> 37:15.901
He knew what he was doing,
and he knew

37:15.934 --> 37:19.271
it was wrong.

37:19.305 --> 37:22.441
You must hold him responsible.

37:27.546 --> 37:29.648
2-1 he walks.

37:29.681 --> 37:31.783
I wouldn't take those odds
on a double homicide.

37:31.817 --> 37:34.052
Safe money, 25 to life.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.587
You didn't see Gabriel
on the stand.

37:35.621 --> 37:37.022
When he cried,
the jury believed him.

37:37.055 --> 37:39.458
(Novak)
No, they didn't.

37:39.491 --> 37:42.861
Guilty.
Murder 2, both counts.

37:42.894 --> 37:44.730
Guess the jury
didn't buy his tears.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.865
Sentencing report
will ask for the max.

37:46.898 --> 37:49.468
Consecutive, Gabriel
gets 50 to life.

37:49.501 --> 37:51.303
Judge could
still drop it down.

37:51.337 --> 37:52.471
Not after she hears
Robin Weller's

37:52.504 --> 37:53.872
father.

37:53.905 --> 37:56.007
He's looking for revenge.
She'll give it to him.

37:59.578 --> 38:01.447
(Novak)
Your Honor,
Robin Weller's father

38:01.480 --> 38:02.514
would like
to make a statement

38:02.548 --> 38:04.916
before you sentence
Gabriel Thomason.

38:04.950 --> 38:07.419
Step up, Mr. Weller.

38:21.900 --> 38:25.036
I miss my son.

38:25.070 --> 38:27.406
I miss him every day.

38:30.842 --> 38:33.645
There were years
when we didn't speak.

38:33.679 --> 38:37.983
When I was so angry at him
for his life.

38:38.016 --> 38:40.452
For his behavior.

38:42.721 --> 38:44.990
But now I regret that.

38:45.023 --> 38:47.593
It's painful every day.

38:50.729 --> 38:53.965
But the last six months
I missed him

38:53.999 --> 38:58.537
the most, because he wasn't
my son anymore.

38:58.570 --> 39:04.676
He'd been taken over
by his addiction.

39:04.710 --> 39:08.514
And the Robin I knew
was gone.

39:11.683 --> 39:16.855
I don't know how many people
Robin infected

39:16.888 --> 39:18.724
or how many more
he would've infected

39:18.757 --> 39:19.991
if he'd lived.

39:26.131 --> 39:27.399
I don't approve

39:27.433 --> 39:29.635
of what Gabriel did.

39:32.904 --> 39:36.007
But I understand
why he did it.

39:40.579 --> 39:43.715
I didn't think
I'd feel this way.

39:43.749 --> 39:46.552
I thought I'd want revenge.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.826
Please...

39:54.860 --> 39:58.063
don't punish him
too severely.

40:09.107 --> 40:10.842
Thank you.

40:10.876 --> 40:14.045
The court appreciates
your statement.

40:40.506 --> 40:42.140
I couldn't stay
and listen.

40:42.173 --> 40:44.009
How much time
did Gabriel get?

40:44.042 --> 40:46.978
15 years.

40:47.012 --> 40:48.880
It's the minimum
for murder.

40:48.914 --> 40:53.084
He would've gotten a lot more
if you hadn't spoken up.

40:53.118 --> 40:57.723
I did so many things wrong
with Robin.

40:57.756 --> 41:01.059
Sure you did
the best you could.

41:04.029 --> 41:07.032
The night he told me
he was gay,

41:07.065 --> 41:09.200
I told him
I wished he was dead.

41:13.805 --> 41:17.743
I'd give anything to have
another chance with my son.

41:35.827 --> 41:38.530
[phone buttons beeping]

41:40.766 --> 41:42.634
[line ringing]

41:44.703 --> 41:46.738
[line continues ringing]
