WEBVTT

00:03.403 --> 00:05.496
The semi's been hijacked.
RC's in the hospital.

00:05.605 --> 00:08.096
We've just lost
all our top-secret data.

00:08.173 --> 00:11.473
Next, we're going to score
something big. I mean really big.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.938
The Ferret's no longer
under our control.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.945
All right, Nickey!

00:16.015 --> 00:18.211
Stealing a Ferret, this
is your idea of fun, is it?

00:18.318 --> 00:21.481
The UPF is armed with enough
explosives to blow up a city block.

00:21.554 --> 00:23.419
You and KITT must stop it.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.589
It's coming at us head on.

00:25.658 --> 00:28.821
That's the whole idea.
It thinks it has us trapped.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.541
Knight Rider,
a shadowy flight...

00:46.613 --> 00:49.207
into the dangerous world
of a man...

00:49.282 --> 00:51.113
who does not exist.

00:59.392 --> 01:01.519
Michael Knight,
a young loner...

01:01.594 --> 01:04.324
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:04.431 --> 01:06.456
the helpless, the powerless...

01:06.533 --> 01:09.525
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:10.830 --> 02:11.819
Colton?

02:11.931 --> 02:13.990
Colton, this is Hollander.

02:14.067 --> 02:16.535
That rig will be coming in
on 97, any minute.

02:16.603 --> 02:18.093
Are you ready?
Yeah.

02:18.471 --> 02:21.372
But I just heard traffic is backed
up on the Interstate for miles.

02:21.441 --> 02:23.102
No way we can get it
to the warehouse.

02:23.176 --> 02:25.167
Then we're going to have to
unload somewhere else.

02:25.245 --> 02:27.577
800 cases of vodka
is too valuable to pass up.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.171
Now, get up here, fast.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.216
Hollander says the rig's
coming in. Move it.

02:33.086 --> 02:34.280
Go, move it!

02:34.888 --> 02:36.685
Hey, I'll catch up
with you later.

02:37.724 --> 02:39.385
Get on, Erika.

02:39.559 --> 02:41.493
No way your little friend
is going to show.

02:41.561 --> 02:43.825
I'm waiting for him,
so bag it, okay?

02:45.265 --> 02:47.859
Sharkey, Decker, get on.
We don't have all day.

03:12.559 --> 03:14.493
Come on, that's 19-6!

03:14.561 --> 03:17.894
Give me a game, will you? What's
the matter with you? Dad, I'm tired.

03:17.964 --> 03:20.159
I said I don't feel like
playing. I told you that.

03:21.801 --> 03:25.032
But you're not going to be happy
till I beat you. And I can't.

03:25.438 --> 03:27.702
I can't beat the great
Glen Arkett at anything.

03:28.007 --> 03:30.805
And you never will,
not with that attitude.

03:35.448 --> 03:37.040
Here come our guests.

03:38.484 --> 03:40.384
We'll put this on hold
for later.

03:54.834 --> 03:57.701
It sure feels good to get off
that Interstate, Michael.

03:57.837 --> 03:59.270
It sure does.

03:59.339 --> 04:02.866
Nothing like a traffic jam to
make you appreciate the open road.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.370
Well, we were due to meet
Bonnie and Devon...

04:05.445 --> 04:07.470
at Arkett Industries
at 9:00 sharp.

04:07.714 --> 04:09.113
What's our new ETA?

04:09.582 --> 04:12.779
We're 21 minutes and
56 seconds behind schedule.

04:12.852 --> 04:15.787
I'm afraid RC3 and
the semi are there by now.

04:15.855 --> 04:18.016
Not unless Bonnie's come up
with a gadget...

04:18.091 --> 04:20.685
to put the semi in two places
at the same time.

04:29.168 --> 04:32.296
Rejected! Yeah!
Clip the Bird's wings!

04:32.372 --> 04:33.896
All right! Yeah!

04:34.073 --> 04:37.201
RC3, it's Michael.
What's happening?

04:37.543 --> 04:39.841
Man, you mean
what was happening.

04:39.912 --> 04:42.779
Check this out.
The Lakers, down by one.

04:42.849 --> 04:45.545
Magic feeds it to Kareem, the
big guy goes to the hoop, and...

04:45.618 --> 04:48.746
A news brief from FLAG's
roving correspondent.

04:48.855 --> 04:50.618
Yeah, with some bad news, RC.

04:50.690 --> 04:53.488
You missed the turnoff to
Arkett Industries by 20 miles.

04:53.726 --> 04:55.159
No way, my man.

04:55.228 --> 04:58.823
I dropped Bonnie and Devon
off at the stroke of 9:00.

04:59.232 --> 05:02.599
I'm sure they're eagerly
awaiting your tardy arrival.

05:02.935 --> 05:04.732
He's gloating, Michael.

05:04.804 --> 05:08.672
Did he expect me to turbo boost over
10 miles of bumper-to-bumper traffic?

05:08.808 --> 05:11.299
I mean, sustained flight
has never been my strength.

05:11.444 --> 05:13.969
Don't let him ruffle
your braking fins, pal.

05:14.247 --> 05:15.680
RC, where are you headed now?

05:15.748 --> 05:17.147
Galloway's Junction...

05:17.283 --> 05:20.411
for a stack of the best
blueberry pancakes...

05:20.486 --> 05:21.953
this side of Michigan Avenue.

05:22.021 --> 05:24.455
I mean, I have got an appetite
that just will not quit.

05:24.857 --> 05:26.688
Neither will your mouth, RC.

05:27.193 --> 05:29.661
I think that's why they call
Chicago the "Windy City."

05:35.601 --> 05:36.932
Okay, now, move in
and take her...

05:37.003 --> 05:39.733
when she hits that empty stretch of
road there, right around that bend.

05:39.806 --> 05:41.774
All right. This is our baby, let's go.

06:07.567 --> 06:10.035
Glen, why don't we talk about
the Ferret some time later?

06:10.103 --> 06:12.401
Better than that, as soon as
Nicholas and I hit the showers...

06:12.472 --> 06:13.700
we'll give you a sneak preview. Done.

06:13.773 --> 06:15.434
Excuse me. There's a call for Nicholas.

06:15.508 --> 06:17.567
Oh, thank you.
Excuse me.

06:20.613 --> 06:22.444
Hello?
Nicholas, where are you?

06:22.515 --> 06:23.504
Oh.

06:24.250 --> 06:27.913
Erika, listen, I don't think
I'm going to be able to make it.

06:27.987 --> 06:29.784
Oh, come on,
I was counting on you.

06:29.856 --> 06:32.984
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm having
trouble shaking my parents.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.856
Okay, well,
make up a story.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.495
I mean, unless...

06:37.730 --> 06:40.631
what your parents want is more
important than what you want.

06:41.167 --> 06:44.261
Erika, come on. I want to
be with you. You know that.

06:46.439 --> 06:49.203
Wait there for me, okay?
Just wait.

07:00.319 --> 07:02.412
Go closer, closer.

07:24.477 --> 07:26.536
Sure ain't
the welcome wagon ladies.

07:36.022 --> 07:37.455
Michael! Michael!

07:37.523 --> 07:39.855
RC? RC, come in!

07:39.926 --> 07:41.860
Somebody... Michael...
Get down!

07:41.928 --> 07:43.190
Move over.

07:44.997 --> 07:46.328
All right,
RC's in trouble, pal.

07:46.399 --> 07:48.629
We got to get back there
right away. Let's go.

07:53.172 --> 07:54.867
All right,
let's button up, buddy.

07:55.074 --> 07:56.939
Super Pursuit Mode.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.147
Whoa, man!

08:13.426 --> 08:16.418
This hitchhiking scene
is getting really dangerous.

08:19.398 --> 08:21.958
You know, we were going
in his direction, Michael.

08:22.034 --> 08:24.434
Yeah, but we never
pick up hitchhikers, KITT.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.903
Keep your scanners peeled.

08:34.746 --> 08:36.647
Erika, hi.
You look great!

08:37.183 --> 08:40.118
Later, Nickey. Come on. Let's
catch up with the guys. Okay.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.381
Where are we going? After
that 18-wheeler with Hollander.

08:42.455 --> 08:45.322
So, come on! Goose it. We're
missing the fun. Come on!

08:58.471 --> 09:01.963
Colton, there's a black T-top coming
in real fast. This could be trouble.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.737
I want you to ditch that guy in
the cab and haul it out of there.

09:09.448 --> 09:11.575
They've thrown RC3
out of the cab.

09:25.331 --> 09:26.764
Scan his vitals!

09:26.899 --> 09:29.390
He's unconscious, Michael.
His breathing is erratic.

09:38.711 --> 09:41.339
RC? It's me.
It's Michael.

09:41.948 --> 09:44.075
You all right?
The semi. I...

09:47.486 --> 09:49.647
I let them get the semi,
Michael.

10:03.736 --> 10:06.261
There's no cargo. We blew
it. We hijacked the wrong rig.

10:06.339 --> 10:09.331
What? You said
a black rig on 97.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.841
Look, I know what I said.

10:11.043 --> 10:14.444
But if this rig is filled with cases
of vodka, I'll drink every bottle.

10:15.648 --> 10:18.617
The truck I was expecting must
have been delayed or rerouted.

10:20.853 --> 10:22.377
What's he doing here?

10:22.822 --> 10:24.050
He's chasing Erika.

10:24.357 --> 10:26.951
He's harmless, you know.
He sits, rolls over...

10:27.326 --> 10:28.554
comes when she calls.

10:35.401 --> 10:36.891
You know what
they got here?

10:37.269 --> 10:39.794
From the look on Hollander's
face, a major foul up.

10:40.172 --> 10:41.469
What, are you kidding?

10:41.674 --> 10:43.266
They bagged the FLAG semi.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.710
Flag? Nickey,
what are you talking about?

10:53.819 --> 10:56.151
The Foundation
for Law and Government.

10:56.222 --> 10:58.452
It's their mobile
headquarters. FLAG.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.752
Man, what a score!

11:00.826 --> 11:02.555
Hey, you guys,
hear what Nickey just said?

11:02.628 --> 11:05.028
Yeah, so? I mean, booze...

11:05.097 --> 11:07.361
furs, TVs, that's a score.

11:08.200 --> 11:11.636
What are we supposed to do with a rig
that's owned by a bunch of rent-a-cops?

11:11.704 --> 11:13.035
You really
want to know?

11:13.105 --> 11:15.505
Of course, they want to
know. Come on, tell them.

11:16.542 --> 11:18.703
Well, if you know
how to use it...

11:19.478 --> 11:21.844
this semi's going to be a
lot more valuable to you...

11:22.114 --> 11:23.809
than some cases
of vodka.

11:23.883 --> 11:25.009
Sure it is.

11:25.484 --> 11:29.250
You guys, he knows what he's
talking about. I'd listen to him.

11:29.321 --> 11:32.188
If he's putting me on, this
is going to be your neck, too.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.624
Now, from here we monitor
the Ferret's movements...

11:40.700 --> 11:43.100
and then we use a solar-powered
inertial guidance system...

11:43.169 --> 11:44.659
to update targeting data.

11:44.937 --> 11:46.734
A brilliant concept, Glen.

11:46.806 --> 11:49.639
This breakthrough will have
a long term impact on...

11:49.742 --> 11:51.903
Oh, here's Michael.
Excuse me. Certainly.

11:51.977 --> 11:53.035
What's wrong?

11:53.746 --> 11:56.010
The semi's been hijacked.
RC's in the hospital.

11:56.082 --> 11:57.310
What? How bad is he?

11:57.483 --> 11:58.780
He's got a concussion.

11:59.652 --> 12:00.744
What happened?

12:01.320 --> 12:04.517
He took a nasty tumble out of the
cab, but he's going to be okay.

12:04.590 --> 12:07.991
He's more worried about the semi
than he is worried about himself.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.195
He feels responsible.

12:10.863 --> 12:12.558
Thank God he's alive.

12:13.265 --> 12:15.893
Michael, do you think you or
RC could identify the hijackers?

12:15.968 --> 12:18.493
Not a chance. Devon, they
were a bunch of bikers.

12:18.637 --> 12:20.764
All happened too fast
to see their faces.

12:22.041 --> 12:24.976
We've just lost
all our top secret data...

12:25.044 --> 12:26.602
and KITT's support systems.

12:26.679 --> 12:28.476
Devon, we can't function
long without them.

12:28.547 --> 12:30.310
This could be a plot
against the Foundation.

12:30.382 --> 12:32.009
No, no, I doubt that.

12:32.084 --> 12:34.609
Devon, I contacted the
Sheriff on the way over here.

12:34.820 --> 12:37.687
He said this group have been
hitting truckers in the area lately.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.520
Do you have any leads?
No.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.184
I wanted to brief
you guys in person.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.694
Getting back on the road is the
key to getting the semi back.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.663
Well, keep us posted.
Be careful, Michael.

12:45.731 --> 12:47.699
Good luck.
Thanks.

12:48.400 --> 12:52.837
I can't help wondering what plans a
group of bikers could possibly have...

12:52.905 --> 12:54.998
for the FLAG command center?

12:57.510 --> 12:58.636
All right!

12:58.711 --> 13:00.702
Come on, come on!

13:01.814 --> 13:03.042
All right.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.114
Here you go!

13:06.185 --> 13:08.551
Unlimited credit line
at three casinos...

13:08.621 --> 13:10.452
everything else comped.

13:10.589 --> 13:12.318
Suite, meals, shows.

13:12.391 --> 13:13.722
I told you guys.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.421
Yeah, but this is in Vegas,
Erika. We're here.

13:18.731 --> 13:19.891
Chartered jet...

13:19.999 --> 13:22.433
chauffeured limo at each end.

13:22.535 --> 13:23.968
When do you want to leave?

13:24.336 --> 13:27.362
All right! How did you learn
so much about computers, huh?

13:27.640 --> 13:29.540
Well, my mom's a programmer.

13:29.742 --> 13:33.143
My dad is a system designer. The
best in the business, naturally.

13:33.279 --> 13:35.975
They eat, sleep
and breathe computers.

13:36.048 --> 13:38.107
I think my first word
was microchip.

13:38.350 --> 13:40.375
So, Nicholas,
with this equipment here...

13:40.452 --> 13:43.114
you can make other computers
do what you want them to, right?

13:43.355 --> 13:45.220
Oh, yeah.
Name it, you got it.

13:45.424 --> 13:46.482
The local bank.

13:46.625 --> 13:48.388
Whoa, yeah!

13:48.460 --> 13:50.428
All right.
Now, wait.

13:51.030 --> 13:54.193
We're talking about serious crime
here. Can you pull it off or not?

13:55.301 --> 13:56.495
Well, yeah, I can but that...

13:56.569 --> 13:59.060
Don't give me "buts," Nicholas.
Just give me the bottom line.

13:59.138 --> 14:01.003
Yes or no.

14:04.543 --> 14:05.737
Come on, Nicholas.

14:10.182 --> 14:12.878
Piece of cake.
Yeah, yeah, I can.

14:12.985 --> 14:16.921
We have to figure out a place to stash
this rig, remember? You figure that out yet?

14:17.022 --> 14:19.855
Yes, and you'll find out where
when we get there. Now, let's go.

14:19.925 --> 14:23.486
Wait a minute, wait. This computer
transmits a constant homing signal.

14:23.929 --> 14:25.954
Now, if I can't
shut this off...

14:26.031 --> 14:27.965
the Foundation
has an operative...

14:28.033 --> 14:30.263
who'll track the semi down
no matter where you hide it.

14:30.336 --> 14:33.635
That operative wouldn't be a guy who
drives around in a black T-top, would it?

14:33.706 --> 14:36.197
Yeah, his name's Knight.
Michael. Michael Knight.

14:37.142 --> 14:38.336
Okay.

14:38.811 --> 14:42.144
First, we stash the rig and if this
guy Knight gets to be a problem...

14:42.248 --> 14:43.681
we stash him, too.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.287
I don't think that's
going to be necessary.

14:50.656 --> 14:51.748
Watch.

14:55.427 --> 14:57.827
Okay.
Nickey! All right!

15:00.699 --> 15:01.996
It's no use, Michael.

15:02.067 --> 15:04.035
Not a trace of
the semi's homing signal.

15:04.103 --> 15:06.230
Bonnie designs
homing devices...

15:06.405 --> 15:09.602
like black boxes in aircraft.
They don't break, KITT.

15:09.675 --> 15:11.506
Are you suggesting
it was deactivated?

15:11.577 --> 15:12.703
Yeah.

15:12.811 --> 15:14.278
I mean,
unless I've missed my guess...

15:14.346 --> 15:16.337
one of these hijackers
knows computers.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.811
All right, maybe we can
still get a fix on the semi.

15:19.885 --> 15:21.978
Scan the area
for radio transmissions...

15:22.054 --> 15:24.113
and the engine's
thermodynamic signature.

15:25.257 --> 15:26.986
Negative
on radio transmissions.

15:27.493 --> 15:29.984
And there are too many trucks
operating in the area...

15:30.062 --> 15:32.087
to isolate the semi's
engine, Michael.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.262
But, the Interstate's
jammed up.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.998
Which means
they had to go north...

15:37.536 --> 15:39.026
through Galloway Junction.

15:39.104 --> 15:40.298
All right, let's hit it.

15:40.372 --> 15:42.772
Chances are somebody there
saw the semi.

15:57.923 --> 15:59.254
All right.
Nice job.

15:59.491 --> 16:01.686
Get this rig out of here
or I'm calling the Sheriff!

16:05.864 --> 16:08.765
Come on, he's an old man.
Nickey, don't be such an airhead.

16:09.001 --> 16:11.196
Why did they have to do that? What?

16:11.537 --> 16:15.439
Do you want to explain getting
busted to your tacky parents? Hmm?

16:18.110 --> 16:20.010
That's enough!
Leave him alone!

16:20.145 --> 16:22.306
What is this?
What are you doing?

16:23.015 --> 16:25.984
What do you want?
Nothing complicated.

16:26.051 --> 16:29.077
Now, you just make it look like
business as usual around here...

16:29.555 --> 16:31.750
otherwise that thing may
just go off, you got it?

16:31.824 --> 16:34.622
Now, for starters, you could
get us something to eat.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.723
'Cause then we've got
some banking to do.

16:38.130 --> 16:40.098
Not until
after the bank closes.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.962
If I try to tie-in
to the computer right now...

16:42.034 --> 16:43.365
someone could
spot the override...

16:43.435 --> 16:46.666
they kill the power,
we're out of business. Okay?

16:47.506 --> 16:49.701
I got to get going.
Wait a minute.

16:49.775 --> 16:51.606
Where do you think
you're going?

16:51.844 --> 16:54.312
Well, this party
at my dad's company.

16:54.380 --> 16:57.315
My folks will start wondering
what's going on if I don't show.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.615
I'm really glad Erika
brought you in, Nicholas.

17:05.223 --> 17:07.214
Now, you just make sure
you come back.

17:07.726 --> 17:11.127
'Cause you won't like what Colton
will do to her if you don't.

17:38.157 --> 17:39.351
Hey, Nicholas?

17:40.059 --> 17:42.619
Nicholas Arkett?
Hey, it is you.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.192
Hey, Michael.

17:44.696 --> 17:45.754
How you doing?

17:45.864 --> 17:47.331
How are you?
Not bad.

17:47.466 --> 17:49.627
Boy, you've done some
serious growing here.

17:50.102 --> 17:52.764
I just saw your folks.
You're missing the shindig.

17:52.838 --> 17:54.635
Yeah, I was on my way...

17:54.706 --> 17:56.503
when my gas gauge bottomed out. Ann.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.304
I thought you were going
to be there, too? Ann!

17:58.377 --> 18:00.038
Yeah. So did I...

18:00.579 --> 18:03.446
It's a shame to be wasting
all this beauty around here.

18:04.149 --> 18:06.379
Oh, no kidding? Hijacked?

18:06.585 --> 18:09.247
As a matter of fact,
it was headed this way.

18:09.354 --> 18:12.255
You didn't see it, did you?
No. But...

18:12.524 --> 18:14.116
you know, I'll let you know if I do.

18:16.228 --> 18:17.559
See you, Mike.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.925
Nicholas,
you forgot to pay...

18:22.801 --> 18:23.927
for your gas.

18:30.876 --> 18:32.138
Let her go.

18:32.878 --> 18:34.175
You trying
to say something?

18:34.246 --> 18:36.271
The lady isn't
on the menu.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.781
Why don't you
take it easy, mister?

18:40.686 --> 18:43.120
I was just trying to
do the lady a favor.

19:04.276 --> 19:06.267
I'm Ann, Ann Galloway.

19:06.612 --> 19:09.308
My dad and I run this place.
Thanks.

19:09.381 --> 19:11.315
You're welcome.
Name's Michael Knight.

19:11.550 --> 19:13.643
Do you know
where's he going?

19:13.752 --> 19:15.913
Oh, that's the garage.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.252
Dad's been doing some work
on his car.

19:19.258 --> 19:22.557
Look, I don't mean to appear
ungrateful but I got a mess to clean up.

19:22.694 --> 19:24.924
You can get gas and food
five miles north.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.761
Yeah, I'm not looking for gas
or food. What I'm looking for...

19:27.833 --> 19:31.360
is a black semi with a chess
piece insignia on the side.

19:31.436 --> 19:32.994
Did you happen
to see that?

19:33.305 --> 19:37.002
Well, there's a lot of semis
coming through here everyday.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.205
If you didn't see it,
maybe your dad did, huh?

19:40.379 --> 19:42.904
Wait a sec!
I did see it. Yeah.

19:42.981 --> 19:45.950
It blew on through here about
half an hour ago, heading north.

19:46.051 --> 19:48.246
North? Okay, thank you.

19:48.453 --> 19:50.284
Sure you're going to be okay? Mmm-hmm.

19:50.355 --> 19:51.879
Okay. Oh!

19:52.791 --> 19:55.760
A friend of mine forgot to pay
for his gas. That should cover it.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.190
Thanks.

19:57.262 --> 19:59.730
Won't be long before Knight
figures out he's been had.

19:59.798 --> 20:01.163
Want me to blow him away?
No!

20:01.233 --> 20:04.100
I don't want someone out here looking
for him before we score that bank.

20:04.169 --> 20:06.296
We're going to have to
chance hitting that bank now.

20:06.738 --> 20:09.172
We're going to move as
soon as I round up Nicholas.

20:14.179 --> 20:15.737
No kidding?

20:15.814 --> 20:17.111
The semi's been hijacked?

20:17.182 --> 20:19.013
Yes, and Michael's
trying to find it.

20:19.084 --> 20:21.609
Now I know how Michael felt
when KITT was destroyed.

20:21.687 --> 20:23.621
It's like half of me
is missing.

20:23.689 --> 20:26.249
Well, Bonnie, the half
that's here is kind of neat.

20:26.325 --> 20:28.259
In Search and Destroy Mode...

20:28.327 --> 20:31.057
it can also detect and evade
unforeseen obstacles...

20:31.330 --> 20:33.924
and plot alternative...
Excuse me.

20:34.099 --> 20:35.726
...any of our personnel.

20:36.201 --> 20:38.328
You hungry?
What I'd like is...

20:38.403 --> 20:39.734
A glass of champagne.

20:39.805 --> 20:41.102
To start with.
Come with me.

20:41.206 --> 20:42.468
...and tertiary targets...

20:42.541 --> 20:45.135
guaranteeing a wide range
of applications...

20:45.210 --> 20:48.202
during a rapidly changing
wartime scenario.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.775
What are you doing here?
Looking for you.

20:50.849 --> 20:52.407
Knight's becoming
a problem.

20:52.484 --> 20:55.214
I want to make that withdrawal
now. I can't just leave...

20:55.287 --> 20:56.811
Nicholas. Well.

20:57.522 --> 20:58.955
I don't believe
we know this gentleman.

20:59.024 --> 21:00.787
That's right, Dad.
You don't.

21:01.026 --> 21:03.654
Well, Glen Arkett, President
of Arkett Industries.

21:03.729 --> 21:06.289
My wife Lydia,
RVP Programming.

21:06.365 --> 21:07.593
Scott Holliman.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.898
And you're with?

21:10.969 --> 21:12.903
He's one of
my professors, Dad.

21:14.539 --> 21:16.131
It's nice
to meet you...

21:16.208 --> 21:17.869
Professor Holliman.
You, too.

21:18.477 --> 21:21.173
We were just about to go and
look over one of my papers.

21:21.246 --> 21:23.510
Well, what is it?
Statistics? Calculus?

21:23.582 --> 21:27.416
Just what is it you're trying to
drum into this impenetrable cranium?

21:28.787 --> 21:30.880
I teach banking
and finance.

21:31.690 --> 21:35.182
Yeah. Not everyone does
things your way, Dad.

21:36.161 --> 21:38.220
Certainly was
a pleasure.

21:40.766 --> 21:43.360
I didn't know that
Nicholas was into finance?

21:43.435 --> 21:44.766
Neither did I.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.403
He's supposed to clear
all his classes with me.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.108
We should have caught up
with the semi by now.

21:51.176 --> 21:53.474
Yeah, I know. I was
thinking the same thing.

21:55.113 --> 21:59.140
You know, something's been bugging
me and I just put my finger on it.

21:59.217 --> 22:01.412
On what, Michael?
Ann's nervousness.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.150
I figured it was due to
her run-in with lover boy...

22:04.222 --> 22:06.452
but that doesn't explain...

22:07.025 --> 22:10.722
a whole tray of sandwiches
in an empty coffee shop.

22:17.302 --> 22:18.633
Why are we stopping?

22:19.271 --> 22:21.501
Well, I think we're on
a wild goose chase, pal.

22:21.606 --> 22:25.508
I just spotted something that will
tell us if the semi really went by here.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.171
Hey.

22:29.381 --> 22:31.281
Hey.
Excuse me?

22:31.483 --> 22:34.646
I'd like to apologize
for our previous encounter.

22:38.890 --> 22:41.120
I couldn't help but notice
you look rather bewildered.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.718
No, man. I get rides
in hot cars all the time.

22:43.795 --> 22:46.764
All the time. Some of them,
they talk to me, too.

22:46.832 --> 22:49.801
One time, man, this car wouldn't shut
up. It just kept repeating itself.

22:49.868 --> 22:51.802
The rear door is ajar.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.531
The rear door is ajar.

22:53.605 --> 22:55.505
And this guy, man,
he freaks out...

22:55.607 --> 22:58.132
yanks all these wires
from underneath the dash...

22:58.210 --> 23:00.303
and puts the poor thing
out of its misery.

23:03.849 --> 23:06.818
Personally, I think
autonasia, to coin a phrase...

23:06.885 --> 23:08.477
should be a capital offense.

23:08.687 --> 23:09.847
Yeah.

23:10.188 --> 23:14.124
So, what's the deal here, man? Are you
going to give me a ride this time, or what?

23:14.860 --> 23:16.122
KITT, I need you.

23:16.261 --> 23:18.559
Sorry, but I'm here
on official business.

23:22.901 --> 23:26.166
Yeah, figures. You sound like one
of those pompous government types.

23:26.238 --> 23:29.230
You know, one of these days, man,
somebody's gonna yank your wires.

23:29.307 --> 23:32.003
KITT, the semi's radials
have a unique tread pattern.

23:32.077 --> 23:35.137
Scan this area of fresh blacktop and
see if you can pick it up, will you?

23:35.213 --> 23:37.147
Hope your clutch falls out.

23:37.315 --> 23:38.577
Oh, very funny.

23:40.285 --> 23:43.413
Michael, I'm afraid none of those
tread patterns match the semi's.

23:43.488 --> 23:46.013
No kidding?
Just the way I figured it.

23:46.091 --> 23:47.683
It never was on this road.

23:47.893 --> 23:51.294
You mean Ann sent us on the
proverbial wild goose chase?

23:51.696 --> 23:54.460
She sure did.
And I think I know why.

23:55.734 --> 23:57.292
Let's get out of here.

24:06.778 --> 24:08.040
Wow!

24:22.661 --> 24:26.188
That's it? You just gained
access to the bank's computer?

24:26.331 --> 24:29.698
Yeah. Okay, now these two
accounts have the biggest balances.

24:30.602 --> 24:33.469
So, if I can reprogram the
automated tellers to ignore...

24:33.538 --> 24:35.665
the limit on withdrawals...
Make it fast.

24:35.740 --> 24:38.436
Colton's going to be at that
bank in a couple of minutes.

24:41.546 --> 24:44.071
Michael, I'm picking up
a radio transmission...

24:44.149 --> 24:46.117
from the semi's
computer console.

24:46.218 --> 24:48.709
All right, good going.
Pinpoint its location.

24:48.787 --> 24:50.812
Ten to one it's coming
from Galloway's Junction.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.290
Bingo!

24:53.592 --> 24:56.561
Okay, trace the destination
of the signal.

25:16.147 --> 25:17.341
Hollander.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.707
Hollander,
we're at the bank.

25:20.552 --> 25:24.420
It's a building 3.692 miles
from our position, Michael.

25:24.523 --> 25:27.014
That's the local bank.
No kidding!

25:27.225 --> 25:30.353
Well, that explains what a gang
of bikers is doing with the semi.

25:30.428 --> 25:32.328
It certainly does.
You were right.

25:32.397 --> 25:35.230
One of the hijackers must be
very computer literate.

25:35.300 --> 25:37.791
So are about half the
teenagers in America, pal.

25:37.903 --> 25:40.133
All right, let's get them!
Super Pursuit Mode.

25:55.353 --> 25:57.446
Come on. All right.

25:58.690 --> 25:59.918
Jackpot!

26:01.993 --> 26:05.053
Right, now, come on, come on,
let's go. Get it in, get it in.

26:05.530 --> 26:08.499
Get it in,
pick it up, hurry up.

26:09.501 --> 26:12.993
Come on. Come on, baby,
all right! All right!

26:15.941 --> 26:19.138
Town's coming up pretty fast.
Hit the EBS.

26:26.985 --> 26:29.419
Okay, back to cruise mode.

26:35.093 --> 26:36.617
Move in on the bank.

26:38.496 --> 26:40.862
There they are.
There they are.

26:43.001 --> 26:45.060
It's Knight. Come on.

26:45.136 --> 26:47.229
Come on, let's go,
let's get out of here!

26:55.313 --> 26:56.974
Microlock that cycle!

27:11.229 --> 27:13.254
That's a live grenade,
Michael.

27:13.331 --> 27:14.593
It's going to blow
any second.

27:14.666 --> 27:17.362
All right, I'm going to let
you put the lid on this one.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.237
You all right?
Yes, Michael.

27:24.309 --> 27:25.674
But what are we
going to do now?

27:25.744 --> 27:29.009
Head for Galloway Junction,
get the semi out of there.

27:29.414 --> 27:32.906
How can we do that without
endangering Ann and her dad?

27:32.984 --> 27:34.713
By evening the odds.

27:34.786 --> 27:36.981
And I think I know
just how to do it.

27:47.098 --> 27:48.861
That's $11,800.

27:48.933 --> 27:51.834
Six ways,
makes almost $2,000 apiece.

27:53.772 --> 27:55.433
Hey, hey, hey!
Five ways.

27:55.874 --> 27:58.399
We got Knight,
but we lost Sharkey doing it.

27:58.476 --> 27:59.943
Even better!

28:00.011 --> 28:02.536
That was practice.
That's petty cash.

28:03.181 --> 28:06.708
Next we're going to score
something big. I mean really big.

28:06.785 --> 28:08.116
Nicholas...

28:08.219 --> 28:10.449
how would you like to
stick it to your old man?

28:10.855 --> 28:12.220
Nickey!

28:12.290 --> 28:14.281
What are you talking about?

28:14.392 --> 28:17.327
Well, you see, they're testing
this Ferret this afternoon.

28:17.529 --> 28:20.987
And, according to this,
it's worth millions.

28:21.833 --> 28:23.460
Now, wait a minute.

28:23.835 --> 28:25.894
Just wait one minute.

28:27.238 --> 28:30.002
Me and my dad, okay, we
don't always get along, but...

28:30.075 --> 28:31.667
I mean, he spent years
developing the UPF.

28:31.776 --> 28:33.209
You wait a minute.

28:35.947 --> 28:38.507
That Ferret is controlled
by a computer, isn't it?

28:39.417 --> 28:40.577
Isn't it?

28:42.253 --> 28:43.720
And with this equipment
around here...

28:43.788 --> 28:45.983
you can take control
of that Ferret, can't you?

28:46.224 --> 28:48.818
Sure he can.
Nicholas, you can do it!

28:49.360 --> 28:52.090
Come on, I know you can.
Hey, so what if he can?

28:52.163 --> 28:55.132
I mean, come on, Hollander, what
are we going to do with a Ferret?

28:55.333 --> 28:58.530
Well, you see, Nicholas here
is going to reprogram it...

28:58.770 --> 29:01.705
to meet us out in the desert,
aren't you, Nicholas?

29:02.640 --> 29:04.039
Sure he will.

29:04.209 --> 29:06.109
Then we're going to
pull it into the semi...

29:06.177 --> 29:08.645
and we're going to drive
that thing down to Mexico.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.180
Then we cut a deal...

29:10.248 --> 29:13.183
and we'll be just like those
Falcon and Snowman dudes, right?

29:14.719 --> 29:17.950
I got a line on a guy down there who
can sell it to the highest bidder for us.

29:18.022 --> 29:19.421
You're nuts!

29:21.025 --> 29:23.016
The Ferret has
an armed warhead on it.

29:23.128 --> 29:25.619
I mean, it's going to take all
kinds of programming just to...

29:25.697 --> 29:29.394
Nicholas, I guess you're going to have
to get started on that now, aren't you?

29:29.801 --> 29:31.598
Because, if you don't...

29:31.736 --> 29:34.068
Colton here has
a couple of small warheads...

29:34.139 --> 29:36.004
with your name on it.

29:37.008 --> 29:38.134
Pow!

29:46.050 --> 29:48.018
Now, watch him.
Okay.

29:54.092 --> 29:55.218
Okay...

29:55.960 --> 29:57.427
I'm going scouting.

29:57.862 --> 30:00.524
We have to find a place to
rendezvous with that Ferret.

30:00.598 --> 30:01.690
Merry Christmas.

30:25.690 --> 30:28.557
Colton, I thought you said
you got Michael Knight.

30:28.626 --> 30:30.253
KITT, are you in position?

30:30.328 --> 30:32.057
Yes, Hollander just
took the bait.

30:32.130 --> 30:33.324
Your plan is working.

30:39.604 --> 30:41.299
Get him! Get him!

30:52.650 --> 30:53.947
Okay, nice timing.

30:54.419 --> 30:58.082
I heard you took a bad tumble back
there, Sharkey. I'm glad you're all right.

31:05.563 --> 31:07.997
I told you the lady
isn't on the menu.

31:46.471 --> 31:49.872
What is your stake in this,
son? You with the police?

31:50.775 --> 31:52.072
Same side.

31:52.477 --> 31:54.342
Foundation for
Law and Government.

31:55.446 --> 31:57.414
We could use
some of that around here.

31:57.482 --> 31:58.676
You got it.

31:59.651 --> 32:03.087
The kid who was driving that
Mercedes, you know where he went?

32:03.521 --> 32:05.546
In the semi
his friends hijacked.

32:06.324 --> 32:09.225
Thanks. Look,
do me a favor.

32:10.428 --> 32:12.760
If he wakes up, let me know. You got it.

32:18.069 --> 32:19.502
Nicholas?

32:20.672 --> 32:23.038
What are you doing with
these people? What's going on?

32:23.107 --> 32:24.165
Nothing, I'm...

32:24.242 --> 32:26.733
I'm just playing some games
with software, that's all.

32:26.811 --> 32:27.835
Michael?

32:32.350 --> 32:34.215
Michael, I'm afraid
the bikers have realized...

32:34.285 --> 32:35.650
they're on
a wild goose chase.

32:35.720 --> 32:37.517
They're heading back
toward the Junction.

32:37.588 --> 32:39.886
Thanks, KITT. Hold it!
Hold it.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.051
Michael, it's nothing.
Don't you lie to me, man.

32:42.126 --> 32:44.151
Look, a Ferret isn't a toy.

32:44.295 --> 32:46.957
I know an override program
when I see one. Hey!

32:47.198 --> 32:48.995
He does not have to
answer to you.

32:49.067 --> 32:51.331
You're right.
Try a judge and a jury.

32:51.402 --> 32:54.462
Will you come off it? We were just
trying to have some fun. It's no big deal.

32:54.539 --> 32:57.303
Hijacking a semi,
robbing a bank...

32:57.375 --> 32:59.639
stealing a Ferret, is this
your idea of fun, is it?

32:59.711 --> 33:01.975
Wait a minute. Wait a
minute! Is it? Is it?

33:02.680 --> 33:05.342
I had nothing to do
with hijacking the semi.

33:05.516 --> 33:07.984
How could you get involved
in something like this?

33:09.654 --> 33:12.122
I didn't know it was
going to turn out like this.

33:15.426 --> 33:17.553
I met Erika
at a concert...

33:18.229 --> 33:20.424
and she introduced me
to some of her friends.

33:20.565 --> 33:21.998
It started out
as a joke.

33:22.066 --> 33:24.830
I got trapped. It just got out
of hand. Oh, you bet it did!

33:24.902 --> 33:27.393
Your friends here
just tried to kill me.

33:27.705 --> 33:30.640
And they're headed back this
way to take another whack at it.

34:03.741 --> 34:05.231
Climb down from there.

34:05.309 --> 34:08.107
Put your hands over your head
or we blow them away.

34:24.929 --> 34:27.489
Cuff them inside
so they stay out of trouble.

34:27.931 --> 34:30.594
We got to move it. That
Ferret rolls in 15 minutes.

34:30.668 --> 34:32.966
We still have to come up
with a rendezvous point.

34:33.371 --> 34:34.360
Got it.

35:15.079 --> 35:17.343
Michael? Michael,
can you hear me?

35:17.415 --> 35:19.849
Michael?
Michael, get out of there.

35:23.721 --> 35:26.884
Come on, Michael, hurry. Those
drums are about to explode.

35:27.692 --> 35:29.523
Hit the CO2, will you, pal?

35:36.934 --> 35:39.334
Good work, KITT. Let's go!

35:52.650 --> 35:55.278
Thanks a lot, pal.
Thanks a lot.

35:55.353 --> 35:57.116
If it wasn't for you,
sustained flight...

35:57.188 --> 35:59.452
would hardly describe what
I'd be doing right about now.

35:59.524 --> 36:00.718
You're welcome, Michael.

36:00.791 --> 36:02.258
We got to get
right down to business.

36:02.326 --> 36:05.193
Ann and her father have been
taken hostage by the bikers...

36:05.263 --> 36:08.721
forcing Nicholas to use the semi
to steal the Ferret during the test.

36:08.799 --> 36:11.359
Evidently, Nicholas got
involved with the wrong crowd.

36:11.435 --> 36:12.663
He sure did.

36:12.770 --> 36:14.863
What time was the test
supposed to start?

36:14.972 --> 36:16.371
Unless it's been
rescheduled...

36:16.440 --> 36:18.772
they're at T minus 12 seconds
and counting.

36:18.843 --> 36:20.435
That's what I was afraid of.

36:20.678 --> 36:23.146
All right, plot me a course
for Arkett Industries.

36:23.214 --> 36:24.613
Get me Devon!

36:32.690 --> 36:34.555
All systems activated.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.015
Okay.

36:37.395 --> 36:38.521
Let's do it.

36:59.283 --> 37:01.751
Emergency call, Mr. Miles.
Michael Knight.

37:01.852 --> 37:03.945
It's coming through
on the speaker phone.

37:04.255 --> 37:07.452
Yes, Michael, you got
some news about the semi?

37:07.525 --> 37:10.392
Bad news, Devon.
You have to scrub the test.

37:10.461 --> 37:12.361
The test?
We can't do that.

37:12.730 --> 37:15.790
I'm afraid you're just seconds
too late for that, Michael.

37:15.866 --> 37:17.731
Those hijackers are
going to steal the Ferret.

37:17.802 --> 37:19.861
They're using Nicholas
and the semi to do it.

37:19.937 --> 37:21.234
Oh, Nicholas!

37:21.305 --> 37:22.329
How in the world
could they...

37:22.406 --> 37:25.000
That Ferret has got to be shut
down, I'm telling you, right now!

37:25.076 --> 37:28.011
I'm afraid it's not quite
as simple as that, Michael.

37:28.446 --> 37:31.882
The UPF is armed with enough
explosives to blow up a city block...

37:32.016 --> 37:35.975
and is programmed to carry out a
specific search and destroy mission.

37:36.087 --> 37:39.545
And isn't one of its features the
ability to update that data on the move?

37:39.624 --> 37:42.525
Correct.
But not instantaneously.

37:44.161 --> 37:46.356
It needs programming time.

37:46.497 --> 37:48.658
The less the better.
I'm coming in.

37:58.409 --> 38:01.742
Come on, come on. You said you could do
it, Nicholas. You better not be stalling!

38:01.812 --> 38:05.509
I'm not stalling. I said this wouldn't
be easy. I'm just doing my best.

38:41.485 --> 38:43.510
How's it going? We're
reprogramming right now.

38:43.721 --> 38:47.384
Nothing. The on-board computer
won't accept any new data.

39:01.772 --> 39:03.763
All right, Nickey!

39:03.841 --> 39:05.706
Way to go.
All right!

39:05.776 --> 39:06.970
That's nice work,
Nicholas.

39:07.044 --> 39:10.377
Now, you just keep that on course
and you park it right out there.

39:12.616 --> 39:14.948
The Ferret's no longer
under our control.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.865
It just left
the grounds.

39:35.306 --> 39:38.036
Michael, you and KITT
must stop it.

39:38.109 --> 39:39.804
Not with that armed warhead.

39:39.877 --> 39:42.710
It's headed for a populated
area. It's too risky.

39:42.847 --> 39:44.747
Devon, our only chance
is to find the semi...

39:44.815 --> 39:46.749
and make sure that Ferret
doesn't do any damage.

39:46.817 --> 39:49.650
You'll need some help.
And I'll need this.

40:47.978 --> 40:49.946
All right. It's up to
the three of us now.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.715
KITT, lock in on the semi's
radio transmission...

40:52.783 --> 40:54.307
and pinpoint its location.

40:57.888 --> 41:02.188
It's parked on a side road,
20.128 miles from our position.

41:02.259 --> 41:04.557
Good work.
Where's the Ferret?

41:07.198 --> 41:08.665
Still on the move.

41:08.799 --> 41:10.892
Michael,
my computations indicate...

41:10.968 --> 41:14.870
it's been reprogrammed incorrectly
and is targeted on the semi.

41:14.939 --> 41:17.305
It will blow it to pieces.
Give me its ETA.

41:17.374 --> 41:19.968
Exactly 1.279 minutes
to impact.

41:20.044 --> 41:22.171
There's no way we can
get there in time.

41:22.446 --> 41:23.845
Pass me to the semi.

41:26.217 --> 41:27.309
Nicholas?

41:27.384 --> 41:29.409
Nicholas, it's Michael
Knight. Can you hear me?

41:29.487 --> 41:30.511
Yeah, Michael, I can.

41:30.588 --> 41:32.852
The Ferret is targeted
on the semi.

41:32.923 --> 41:34.982
Get everyone out of there,
right now!

41:35.693 --> 41:38.093
Nice try, Knight. But
that's not going to work.

41:38.162 --> 41:39.720
This is no trick. I'm...

41:40.798 --> 41:43.926
Can you revise the Ferret's search
and destroy program from here?

41:44.068 --> 41:45.365
I think so.

41:45.603 --> 41:48.436
We can transmit the data
through the semi's computers.

41:49.006 --> 41:50.303
Okay.

41:50.975 --> 41:53.944
We're going to give
the Ferret a new target.

41:55.079 --> 41:56.171
Don't ask.

41:56.847 --> 41:58.075
Oh, no.

41:58.549 --> 42:00.847
Oh, no, he's right.
What are you talking about?

42:00.951 --> 42:04.318
I screwed something up when I transmitted
the rendezvous data to the Ferret.

42:05.823 --> 42:07.586
It thinks the semi
is the target.

42:08.025 --> 42:10.459
What, you mean they're
going to blow us all up?

42:10.528 --> 42:13.224
Yeah. I have no control
over it and I'm not kidding.

42:13.297 --> 42:15.697
I can't stop it, and I can't
change its course.

42:15.866 --> 42:17.333
Well, it's time
I changed mine.

42:18.435 --> 42:20.665
Wait a minute, where are
you going? What about them?

42:20.738 --> 42:22.899
Witnesses get
an early Fourth of July.

42:24.074 --> 42:26.508
Wait, that's cold-blooded
murder. Come on, give me the keys!

42:26.577 --> 42:27.703
Come on, Nickey! Let's go!
No!

42:27.778 --> 42:30.212
Come on! This is where I get off, Erika.

42:30.281 --> 42:33.182
I should've never gotten
involved with them or you, either.

42:33.317 --> 42:36.343
Oh, yeah? Well, you mean
a lot to me, too.

42:37.087 --> 42:40.079
You want to die?
Be my guest.

42:45.496 --> 42:47.555
Come on, Erika! Let's go!

42:47.665 --> 42:48.996
Go! Go!

43:11.689 --> 43:12.849
What's the problem?

43:12.923 --> 43:14.584
There's interference.
Someone's trying to...

43:14.658 --> 43:18.094
reprogram from the semi's
console simultaneously.

43:18.295 --> 43:19.523
Nicholas, is that you?

43:19.763 --> 43:22.129
Yeah, Michael, it's me.
I'm the only one left.

43:22.232 --> 43:24.427
They handcuffed Ann
and her father to the semi.

43:24.935 --> 43:29.338
I stayed to reprogram the Ferret,
but I can't! I can't do this!

43:29.573 --> 43:31.473
Just take it easy.

43:31.542 --> 43:33.169
Bonnie just
worked it out.

43:33.744 --> 43:38.078
Nicholas? You and I are going to
give the Ferret another target.

43:38.983 --> 43:40.075
You ready?

43:46.590 --> 43:48.057
It's the bikers, Michael.

43:49.159 --> 43:52.253
All right, microlock the
brakes and their steering.

43:59.536 --> 44:01.197
I can't hold the microlock...

44:01.271 --> 44:04.934
and continue to reprogram with Bonnie
and Nicholas. The bikers will get away.

44:05.009 --> 44:08.274
Okay, focus your thermo-dynamic
generator on their tires.

44:15.352 --> 44:16.546
You got a flat.

44:17.554 --> 44:19.385
No, I got two flats!

44:21.225 --> 44:22.283
What is it?

44:22.359 --> 44:24.759
My tires are flat!
Oh, jeez!

44:27.164 --> 44:29.359
What happened here?
The brakes locked.

44:29.433 --> 44:31.060
What did you do here?
I didn't do anything.

44:34.104 --> 44:36.595
All right, transmit their
location to the Sheriff.

44:37.041 --> 44:38.406
You're back on.

44:38.475 --> 44:42.844
Nicholas? Nicholas, I'm transmitting
the last set of reprogramming codes.

44:55.292 --> 44:57.283
Okay, 10 seconds, Bonnie.
Hurry!

45:07.304 --> 45:09.864
She did it.
Bonnie did it!

45:10.307 --> 45:12.070
The Ferret's targeted
on KITT now.

45:13.977 --> 45:15.672
Now what do we do,
Michael?

45:16.313 --> 45:18.975
Trick it into
completing its mission.

45:46.110 --> 45:48.101
They just entered
the grounds.

45:48.212 --> 45:49.907
Michael, you and KITT
must stop it.

46:02.025 --> 46:04.687
It's coming at us head on.
That's the whole idea.

46:04.762 --> 46:06.559
It thinks
it has us trapped.

46:06.630 --> 46:08.757
All right, get ready,
pal, to turbo boost.

46:08.832 --> 46:09.856
Now!

46:25.549 --> 46:29.417
Not exactly a sustained
flight, but I'll take it!

46:31.255 --> 46:32.620
So will I.

46:47.237 --> 46:49.137
Splendid work,
both of you.

46:49.206 --> 46:52.198
Well, it did three of us.
Nicholas risked his life to help.

46:52.276 --> 46:55.507
Yes, of course. I have a feeling
this will be a turning point for him.

46:55.579 --> 46:58.070
He and his parents are much too
bright not to learn from it...

46:58.148 --> 47:01.709
I agree. With everyone's help, I think
Nicholas should end up a solid citizen.

47:01.819 --> 47:04.652
Talking about me, again?
Hey! How you doing?

47:04.721 --> 47:06.689
Great.
Good as new.

47:06.757 --> 47:08.418
Good as new,
that's splendid.

47:08.492 --> 47:09.754
We have a present
for you.

47:10.127 --> 47:12.220
Oh, yeah! Check it out.

47:12.329 --> 47:13.796
All right!

47:14.464 --> 47:19.197
Magnificent. And I suggest you put it
on and return to your post immediately.

47:19.870 --> 47:22.737
You know how I feel about your
leaving the cab in transit.

47:22.806 --> 47:25.468
That's right. We wouldn't
want to be hijacked again...

47:25.576 --> 47:26.838
and not know it.

47:27.611 --> 47:28.976
Heaven forbid.

47:29.780 --> 47:32.078
You took the words
right out of my mouth.
