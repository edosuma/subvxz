00:29.997 --> 00:32.165
(dance music playing)

00:57.958 --> 00:59.760
(dogs barking)

01:01.328 --> 01:02.763
(grunts)

01:11.572 --> 01:13.240
(alarm ringing)

01:14.575 --> 01:16.944
(groans)

01:16.944 --> 01:18.579
Damn.

01:19.813 --> 01:22.716
So we realize Nyla left her
history book in Kevin's car,

01:22.716 --> 01:24.618
then we had to drive all the
way over to the west side,

01:24.618 --> 01:27.688
but he already left Monica's
house by the time we got there.

01:27.688 --> 01:31.792
Long story short, it was quicker for her
to drop me off at the house, so she did.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.594
And that, O Mother,

01:33.594 --> 01:36.797
is the epically long, yet
tediously dull account of why my car

01:36.797 --> 01:37.932
isn't in the driveway.

01:37.932 --> 01:41.101
Ugh, well, just make sure
and pick it up after school.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.337
Because I have back to back
meetings. I can't drive you.

01:43.337 --> 01:44.905
(school bell ringing)

01:44.905 --> 01:47.141
A few questions, and feel free
to answer them in any order:

01:47.141 --> 01:48.976
How are you? And where's my car?

01:48.976 --> 01:51.278
Pretty good, and I have no idea.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.781
- Oh.
- You lost your car?

01:53.781 --> 01:55.749
I didn't lose it. It's just
currently occupying a space

01:55.749 --> 01:57.218
I'm presently unaware of.

01:57.218 --> 02:01.088
Well, let's see: You left the party,
you said you had to run a quick errand,

02:01.088 --> 02:02.623
and that you'd be right back.

02:02.623 --> 02:05.292
And you never came right back.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.329
I know.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.297
Maybe your car went to go find

02:10.297 --> 02:13.167
that hoodie you borrowed from me
last month that also went missing.

02:13.167 --> 02:14.735
Wow, mystery solved.

02:16.303 --> 02:17.838
Maddie, do you know what this is?

02:19.106 --> 02:21.041
Um, it's a bottle of water.

02:21.041 --> 02:22.710
Do the questions get harder...

02:27.014 --> 02:29.717
This... isn't water.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.852
No, it's not. It's vodka.

02:32.987 --> 02:34.688
We found this in Maddie's
locker this morning.

02:34.688 --> 02:37.591
And can you do that, just search my locker?

02:37.591 --> 02:38.659
Indeed, we can.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.862
One of my friends must have
put it in there as a joke.

02:41.862 --> 02:46.033
Alcohol on school premises is
a very serious offense, Maddie.

02:46.033 --> 02:47.101
It's cause for expulsion.

02:48.102 --> 02:50.571
Well, like I said, it's not mine.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.640
Good.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.941
Then this will just help clear it up.

02:55.142 --> 02:57.845
I just need you to blow on that tip.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.017
I don't have to do this. I know my rights.

03:05.919 --> 03:09.757
"Students who are suspected of consuming
illegal substances on school grounds

03:09.757 --> 03:11.825
will immediately be tested
by appointed school officials

03:11.825 --> 03:13.827
and will face possible expulsion.

03:13.827 --> 03:16.764
Any student refusing to submit to testing,

03:16.764 --> 03:19.266
will also face possible expulsion."

03:19.266 --> 03:20.701
Hm.

03:27.041 --> 03:28.642
(clears throat)

03:29.743 --> 03:31.078
(machine calibrates)

03:31.078 --> 03:32.246
Go ahead.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.188
- (beeping)
- Thank you.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.598
- Maddie, how could you?
- Mom.

03:51.598 --> 03:53.600
- This is so unfair.
- You better take this seriously.

03:53.600 --> 03:57.171
Unfortunately, I'm going to have
to report this to the Head Master,

03:57.171 --> 03:59.640
and it's his decision whether or
not Maddie can remain a student here.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.709
You've got to be kidding me.

04:01.709 --> 04:04.144
Is there any other option?

04:07.648 --> 04:09.116
24 hours of detox

04:09.116 --> 04:11.985
and 90 days at a sober-living
facility, effective immediately.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.888
The closest teen treatment center

04:14.888 --> 04:16.357
is 40 miles away, but...

04:16.357 --> 04:19.760
with parental consent, I
can arrange for you to live

04:19.760 --> 04:21.894
in an adult facility that's closer.

04:21.894 --> 04:23.597
You can go to school by day

04:23.597 --> 04:24.865
and spend your evenings getting sober,

04:24.865 --> 04:26.600
but, Maddie, I will be watching you...

04:26.600 --> 04:28.035
I'm not going to rehab.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.570
It's not rehab.

04:29.570 --> 04:32.706
It's a residential,
outpatient treatment facility.

04:35.642 --> 04:37.878
And you're out of your damn mind.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.913
(scoffs) I'm sorry to hear that.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.283
She'll do it.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.253
What?

04:51.291 --> 04:53.761
These are prohibited in detox.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.963
You can have it back after 24 hours.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.865
Now, please head down to room 248

04:57.865 --> 04:59.600
for the strip search.

05:10.677 --> 05:12.613
(dramatic music playing)

05:39.606 --> 05:41.875
(rock music playing)

05:48.215 --> 05:50.851
â™ª Hit the sheets, learn to sleep â™ª

05:50.851 --> 05:53.253
â™ª Firm and strong â™ª

05:53.253 --> 05:55.856
â™ª All the ones who make you catch â™ª

05:55.856 --> 05:57.724
â™ª Are cursed dogs â™ª

06:02.329 --> 06:03.797
- (sobbing)
- â™ª Suffocate â™ª

06:08.602 --> 06:11.038
â™ª Stay awake, save a plate â™ª

06:11.038 --> 06:13.640
â™ª Count your treats â™ª

06:13.640 --> 06:16.043
â™ª Make you melt, make you feel â™ª

06:16.043 --> 06:18.178
â™ª So good it stinks â™ª

06:18.178 --> 06:21.281
â™ª Whoa â™ª

06:23.050 --> 06:26.253
â™ª Whoa â™ª

06:31.758 --> 06:32.793
(puking)

06:32.793 --> 06:34.194
â™ª Suffocate â™ª

06:38.298 --> 06:40.601
(rock music continues)

06:44.571 --> 06:46.573
This is ridiculous.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.674
I'm not an addict.

06:47.674 --> 06:51.044
If I was, wouldn't I have
been Lohan-ing in detox?

06:51.044 --> 06:52.913
Getting my drivers license was more taxing.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.282
Why? Why are you doing this to me?

06:55.282 --> 06:56.884
This is so unfair!

06:56.884 --> 06:58.852
This is your fault. I hate you!

06:58.852 --> 07:00.587
Tell you what...

07:00.587 --> 07:02.322
why don't I just stay home every night?

07:02.322 --> 07:04.758
You can monitor me, smell my breath,

07:04.758 --> 07:06.693
make me pee in a cup.

07:06.693 --> 07:08.829
I hate everything.

07:12.733 --> 07:13.834
(sighs)

07:30.617 --> 07:33.720
(people chatting, applause)

07:37.658 --> 07:39.726
(people greeting)

07:47.668 --> 07:49.603
(upbeat music playing)

07:49.603 --> 07:54.041
â™ª This time is my time so step aside â™ª

07:56.610 --> 07:57.978
I have good news.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.746
You're not dead.

08:00.847 --> 08:02.616
All right. Okay.

08:02.616 --> 08:05.252
We have a couple more of these,

08:05.252 --> 08:08.021
and then we are officially
done with the paperwork.

08:08.021 --> 08:11.024
That one is a statement that
Maddie has finished detox

08:11.024 --> 08:13.660
and is currently 24 hours
drug and alcohol free.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.865
So, Craig, how long have
you been a counselor here?

08:18.865 --> 08:21.568
Two years, yeah.

08:21.568 --> 08:23.704
And how long have you been sober?

08:23.704 --> 08:25.138
Hm?

08:25.138 --> 08:27.574
Me? Oh, no, no, no.

08:27.574 --> 08:31.078
I'm not in recovery. I'm just a counselor.

08:31.078 --> 08:33.013
You really got screwed
at the job fair, huh?

08:33.013 --> 08:34.581
- Maddie.
- What? He's like 12 years old.

08:34.581 --> 08:35.881
25.

08:35.881 --> 08:37.884
And highly certified.

08:37.884 --> 08:39.820
Would you like to see
my credentials, Maddie?

08:39.820 --> 08:41.655
That won't be necessary.

08:41.655 --> 08:44.625
Please excuse my daughter's rude behavior.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.860
Yes, I'm much more
affable when I'm not being

08:46.860 --> 08:48.829
institutionalized against my will.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.897
Right, now, this one says

08:50.897 --> 08:52.766
that if you go before the 90 days are up,

08:52.766 --> 08:55.669
I've still got to charge
your mom for all of it.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.604
So I can leave?

08:57.604 --> 09:00.040
No. No, you cannot.

09:00.040 --> 09:04.044
Now, all the information is in here.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.046
But...

09:09.016 --> 09:11.018
Thank you. But...

09:11.018 --> 09:13.620
Quick lowdown: group sessions, every day,

09:13.620 --> 09:14.921
one-on-ones with me, daily.

09:14.921 --> 09:17.758
You're on bathroom clean
up in the women's wing.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.226
Curfew is strictly enforced.

09:19.226 --> 09:22.629
And you will need to earn the
right to use your cell phone.

09:24.598 --> 09:25.866
You're joking.

09:25.866 --> 09:29.636
You do realize the withdrawal I'm going
to go through from not having my phone

09:29.636 --> 09:31.605
is far greater than what you're expecting

09:31.605 --> 09:33.173
from my so-called "addiction."

09:41.181 --> 09:43.750
Thank you. Also, for the first week,

09:43.750 --> 09:47.621
you can only leave for school
and scheduled group activities.

09:47.621 --> 09:49.656
But I get to go home on weekends, right?

09:51.224 --> 09:54.728
Recovery isn't a 9-5, Maddie. Okay?

09:56.063 --> 09:58.265
All right, okay. Look, here's...

09:59.266 --> 10:00.801
Here's the deal.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.670
You're going to find
temptation everywhere you go,

10:03.670 --> 10:06.339
which is why you're going to need
what I would call the four "S's."

10:06.339 --> 10:08.008
Now, that's sobriety...

10:08.008 --> 10:10.844
Cray-Cray, you need to get your ass
in the game room, like, right now.

10:10.844 --> 10:14.648
Oh right, yes. So everyone has
their own little nicknames for me.

10:14.648 --> 10:15.615
W... what's going on?

10:15.615 --> 10:17.184
Oh, Vern took the remote

10:17.184 --> 10:20.153
and said he's not giving it back until
he finds out who stole his Cheesy Chomps

10:20.153 --> 10:21.588
and they apologize.

10:21.588 --> 10:23.724
Okay, I will take care of that.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.926
Would you mind giving Maddie a quick tour?

10:25.926 --> 10:28.695
Not at all. Hi!

10:29.796 --> 10:30.831
(mouths)

10:30.831 --> 10:33.033
Well, I'll let you girls go ahead.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.668
I'm going to let myself out.

10:35.669 --> 10:37.604
You can call me if you need
me to bring you anything.

10:37.604 --> 10:38.739
- Okay?
- How?

10:38.739 --> 10:40.040
He took my friggin' phone.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.641
There's a house phone.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.814
(sighs) Hug me.

10:52.919 --> 10:55.222
You're so sweet. Come on, girl.

10:56.590 --> 10:58.592
Welcome to Springtime Meadows.

10:58.592 --> 11:00.260
You're gonna love it
here. We have so much fun.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.828
Sober people decorated the house.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.096
It's cool, right?

11:03.096 --> 11:05.665
All right, I'll give you a hint.
You're still very, very cold.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.868
Girl: All right, everybody, this is Maddie.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.102
Hi, Maddie. I'm Vern.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.871
Did anybody look in the piano?

11:10.871 --> 11:13.740
Maddie, you understand the difference
between right and wrong, right?

11:13.740 --> 11:15.742
If I did, would I be here?

11:15.742 --> 11:17.310
That's a good answer.

11:17.310 --> 11:19.146
Take this.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.680
Guard it with your life.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.282
Okay.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.651
- You're weird.
- You say that like it's a bad thing.

11:24.651 --> 11:27.220
All right, now, the
kitchen is straight ahead.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.889
The game room is to the
left, in the basement.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.257
That's where we play ping pong.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.826
I always win. I used to be
really good at all kinds of sports

11:32.826 --> 11:35.695
until I got into... Guess what
I go into. You'll never guess.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.598
For the sake of friends and
family, I hope it was downers.

11:38.598 --> 11:40.634
Meth. It was meth, girl.

11:40.634 --> 11:42.669
But you can't tell from my teeth, huh?

11:42.669 --> 11:44.571
I know, right? (Giggles)

11:44.571 --> 11:47.007
Girl: So yeah, it was really bad.
I lost custody of my daughter,

11:47.007 --> 11:49.943
but I'm gonna get her back. She's the
reason I gotta to get clean, you know.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.578
She's so sweet and so cute.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.180
Like, she-could-totally-be
in-pageants cute.

11:53.180 --> 11:56.349
I have her tattooed on my thigh. Not
her face, but her name. You want to see?

11:56.349 --> 11:58.718
- Maybe later.
- Well, you will see later, honey.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.987
Because guess what? We are...

12:00.987 --> 12:02.756
roomies!

12:02.756 --> 12:04.357
(shrieks)

12:04.357 --> 12:05.992
Oh, you don't know how excited I am.

12:05.992 --> 12:09.362
I've been waiting so long to have a
roommate that's not going through menopause.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.832
You know, you're crushing my will to live.

12:11.832 --> 12:14.367
Oh, sorry. Okay.

12:14.367 --> 12:17.571
So, you have to journal, because
it's a part of the program,

12:17.571 --> 12:19.706
but I love it because it's so much fun

12:19.706 --> 12:21.641
because I love to gossip.

12:21.641 --> 12:23.743
So, what are you in for?

12:23.743 --> 12:25.245
Um...

12:26.680 --> 12:28.648
a few sips of vodka.

12:28.648 --> 12:31.151
That's all? Girl, this is
going to be easy for you.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.091
What? You want some of
Vern's Cheesy Chomps?

12:39.292 --> 12:41.661
- I'm good.
- Okay.

12:41.661 --> 12:43.630
Trish? Trish, did you take my...

12:46.366 --> 12:47.801
Maddie Graham.

12:47.801 --> 12:48.969
Rebecca Granger.

12:52.138 --> 12:54.207
Well, I suppose it was
only a matter of time.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.043
Wait.

12:57.043 --> 12:58.211
So you two know each other?

12:58.211 --> 13:01.214
Yeah, we're old friends.

13:06.753 --> 13:07.954
Oh.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.990
- Oh my god.
- That's so nice.

13:14.728 --> 13:17.731
Last thing I remember is
drinking a lot of tequila.

13:19.299 --> 13:23.236
I woke up in lock up, them tell me me
stabbed my cheating husband four times.

13:25.605 --> 13:28.942
That guilt stays with me.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.212
Don't get me wrong, I hate him.

13:33.713 --> 13:35.081
But I hate me more.

13:37.050 --> 13:40.086
One time, the CIA

13:40.086 --> 13:42.789
dosed an entire village with LSD

13:42.789 --> 13:44.291
just to see what would happen.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.825
(laughing)

13:45.825 --> 13:47.727
Girl: They did.

13:47.727 --> 13:50.830
I guess what I've been
struggling with the most is...

13:50.830 --> 13:52.899
how my ugly past

13:52.899 --> 13:54.734
keeps coming back to haunt me.

14:01.975 --> 14:04.210
So, I had another dream last night.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.014
A relapse dream.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.585
And it's that guilt you wake up with.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.256
It's hard to shake.

14:18.325 --> 14:21.695
Even when you wake up and you
realize you were just dreaming,

14:21.695 --> 14:23.229
you didn't do anything wrong...

14:24.698 --> 14:26.099
and I...

14:27.100 --> 14:28.702
I just...

14:31.805 --> 14:33.640
I don't really want to
talk about this right now.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.349
We'll deal with this at your
one-on-one tomorrow, okay?

14:42.349 --> 14:43.850
- Okay, thank you.
- All right.

14:45.719 --> 14:48.021
(sighs) Okay, well, my friends,

14:48.021 --> 14:52.021
today is a day of hellos and goodbyes.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.362
Maddie, would you like
to introduce yourself?

14:56.763 --> 14:58.598
Hi, I'm Maddie.

14:58.598 --> 15:02.268
Oh right, yes. So in group, we
introduce ourselves by saying,

15:02.268 --> 15:05.839
"Hi, I'm whomever, and I'm an alcoholic."

15:08.041 --> 15:10.677
Hi, I'm whomever, and I'm an alcoholic.

15:10.677 --> 15:14.347
Very good, very good. I
haven't heard that one before.

15:16.082 --> 15:17.884
I'm sorry, guys. I just don't belong here.

15:17.884 --> 15:19.185
You know?

15:19.185 --> 15:20.754
I really don't.

15:20.754 --> 15:23.690
I appreciate your sobriety journey,

15:23.690 --> 15:25.759
but I'm just here because I have to be.

15:26.659 --> 15:29.029
Craig, I just remembered something.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.663
- I don't belong here either.
- Me either.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.332
(all laughing)

15:33.900 --> 15:37.604
Did anyone else feel like they
didn't belong here their first day?

15:37.604 --> 15:40.006
- (overlapping agreement)
- Yeah, I thought so.

15:41.007 --> 15:43.676
Maddie, no one thinks they belong here...

15:44.711 --> 15:46.346
at first, but...

15:46.346 --> 15:50.250
I think that where it took
some of these guys weeks

15:50.250 --> 15:51.985
to come around,

15:51.985 --> 15:54.621
I've got a feeling that it's
going to take you two days.

15:56.756 --> 15:59.793
Two days of hating me,

15:59.793 --> 16:01.628
hating them, hating this place.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.631
But I do have faith in you.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.835
He said the same thing to all of us.

16:08.835 --> 16:11.604
- (laughing)
- I absolutely did not.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.673
- Sorry, brother.
- All right, okay.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.341
Maddie, hello.

16:15.341 --> 16:18.711
- (overlapping greetings)
- Hello, kid.

16:18.711 --> 16:19.913
(under breath) Hi, Maddie.

16:19.913 --> 16:23.316
And we are bidding a very fond farewell

16:23.316 --> 16:25.285
to our very dear Douglas,

16:25.285 --> 16:27.687
AKA Mr. "I'm going to rip your head off."

16:27.687 --> 16:29.689
We're really going to miss you, buddy.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.725
As is Springtime Meadows' ritual,

16:32.725 --> 16:34.694
we have a parting gift for you,

16:34.694 --> 16:37.297
and, Doug, you will leave
behind something for the house.

16:37.297 --> 16:38.698
Great.

16:40.300 --> 16:44.300
Okay, so, we all chipped
in and we got you this.

16:48.241 --> 16:50.877
Oh, you replaced the one I lost.

16:50.877 --> 16:53.613
(laughing)

16:53.613 --> 16:55.348
Man: Put it on. Put it on.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.883
Man: Yes.

16:56.883 --> 16:59.719
- (cheering)
- Handsome!

16:59.719 --> 17:01.788
Trish: Don't lose this one.

17:03.156 --> 17:05.625
Wow. (Clears throat)

17:05.625 --> 17:07.861
Um...

17:07.861 --> 17:10.964
I'm just really grateful for you all...

17:12.065 --> 17:14.666
and for this house,

17:14.666 --> 17:15.935
and for my sobriety.

17:18.570 --> 17:21.974
My life is so different now, and I'm just
so excited to go out there and live it.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.945
So I made something for the house.

17:26.945 --> 17:29.682
It's kind of stupid, but...

17:35.755 --> 17:38.925
That's beautiful. You made this?

17:38.925 --> 17:42.128
- Yeah.
- Aw, thank you.

17:42.128 --> 17:44.063
All right, come on, everyone.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.765
- Bring it in.
- Watch my vase.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.367
Craig: Yeah, watch the vase.

17:48.801 --> 17:51.704
Hey, you take care of these guys, okay?

17:52.705 --> 17:54.240
And let them take care of you.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.143
- Okay?
- Okay.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.113
(chattering)

18:02.315 --> 18:04.017
Welcome to the fun house.

18:24.137 --> 18:25.905
Ooh, this is pretty.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.607
My dad gave that to me. He's dead.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.643
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:31.644 --> 18:32.912
Sorry.

18:32.912 --> 18:35.782
It plays the theme from Ice Castles.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.884
I don't know what that is.

18:37.884 --> 18:40.954
So when did your dad...

18:40.954 --> 18:43.756
Three years ago, this Memorial Day.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.625
And how old were you?

18:45.625 --> 18:46.960
14.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.195
Well, that sucks.

18:49.195 --> 18:50.663
I'm so sorry.

18:54.667 --> 18:57.704
So how did he die?

18:57.704 --> 18:59.639
He was killed by a drunk driver.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.675
The irony is not lost on me.

19:02.675 --> 19:03.576
Huh?

19:04.744 --> 19:06.145
Never mind.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.091
Dad?

19:52.091 --> 19:54.294
Hi, princess.

19:54.294 --> 19:56.663
You know I hate it when you call me that.

19:57.664 --> 19:58.731
I know.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.336
I miss you.

20:04.570 --> 20:05.672
Like, a lot.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.707
Shh.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.610
I'm sure I'm going to be
seeing you very, very soon.

20:10.610 --> 20:13.246
- (horn blaring)
- (gasps)

20:13.246 --> 20:15.081
(breathing heavily)

20:25.124 --> 20:28.161
Tell me again why I'm not
allowed to drive myself to school?

20:28.161 --> 20:30.330
I hate to be the bearer
of bad tidings, Maddie,

20:30.330 --> 20:32.198
but you're going to be
under constant supervision.

20:32.198 --> 20:35.001
Well, good. You'll get to see that
my life is actually pretty boring,

20:35.001 --> 20:36.936
and I'm not an addict.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.772
Have you ever stopped to consider
the reason I was drinking in school

20:39.772 --> 20:41.774
is because it's insufferably boring?

20:41.774 --> 20:44.577
I make decent grades. How
do you think that's possible?

20:44.577 --> 20:47.080
- Maybe we should just open up a bar on campus
- Maybe you should.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.281
I'll get right on that.

20:55.688 --> 20:56.789
Are you taking drugs?

20:57.790 --> 20:59.125
Yes, I do crack.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.728
Lots and lots of crack. In
fact, I'm on crack right now.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.329
I'm serious, Maddie.

21:03.329 --> 21:04.664
Do you do drugs?

21:04.664 --> 21:06.366
(dance music playing)

21:11.704 --> 21:13.172
No, I do not do drugs.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.776
But even if I did, what
business is it of yours?

21:16.776 --> 21:19.612
Aren't you supposed to be getting kids
into college and handing out condoms?

21:19.612 --> 21:23.149
I'm just not exactly sure why
you've taken such an interest in me.

21:23.149 --> 21:27.086
I'm a good student. Hell, I'm
a frickin' virgin, by choice.

21:27.086 --> 21:28.888
Ask anyone.

21:28.888 --> 21:30.256
So whatever you think you know...

21:30.256 --> 21:34.327
Maddie, a lot of aggression comes
out in the early stages of recovery.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.929
While it makes sense that
you would take it out on me,

21:36.929 --> 21:39.599
the deal I made with
you was more than fair.

21:39.599 --> 21:43.599
So I'm here, when you're ready
to have a real conversation.

21:44.036 --> 21:47.607
But until then, I hope
you like Christian pop.

21:47.607 --> 21:49.041
(Christian pop playing)

21:49.041 --> 21:51.711
â™ª Jesus is my savior â™ª

21:51.711 --> 21:55.114
â™ª Savior â™ª

21:55.114 --> 21:57.016
I love that song.

21:57.016 --> 21:59.919
Oh, that was the longest
car ride of my life.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.689
- Let me know if you need anything.
- I don't.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.894
Hey, babe.

22:07.894 --> 22:10.930
Why did you come to school
with the guidance counselor?

22:12.632 --> 22:14.867
Uh, my car is in the shop.

22:14.867 --> 22:18.704
And Ms. Molina lives close to us, and her
and my mom are friends, and I hate her.

22:18.704 --> 22:20.640
I would have given you a ride.

22:21.707 --> 22:23.709
Oh, my phone's broken.

22:23.709 --> 22:25.645
And as much as I love you,

22:25.645 --> 22:28.614
(clears throat) I'm a terrible girlfriend

22:28.614 --> 22:30.583
because I don't have your number memorized.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.752
My life is falling apart. Hold me.

22:34.954 --> 22:37.323
- Come here, babe.
- Okay.

22:39.926 --> 22:41.661
(giggles)

22:42.662 --> 22:44.297
I mean, here's the thing.

22:44.297 --> 22:47.166
I've always been the kind of person
that's like, "Sure, whatever."

22:47.166 --> 22:48.835
I kind of just go with the flow,

22:48.835 --> 22:51.103
because life is so short, right?

22:52.271 --> 22:55.741
Wait, what was I talking about? (Laughs)

22:57.610 --> 22:59.912
Have you ever told a little white lie...

23:00.980 --> 23:04.217
and had to pile on many
other little white lies

23:04.217 --> 23:06.986
to hide that little white lie?

23:08.187 --> 23:10.022
I have never told a lie in my entire life.

23:10.022 --> 23:11.624
Seriously?

23:11.624 --> 23:13.793
See how good I am at it?

23:13.793 --> 23:15.161
- Mm.
- (laughs)

23:16.162 --> 23:18.798
If Zack asks, my car is in the shop.

23:19.966 --> 23:21.934
- Oh, little white lie?
- Mm-hmm.

23:23.669 --> 23:25.238
Where is your car?

23:25.238 --> 23:27.006
Duh, it's where I left it.

23:27.006 --> 23:28.341
Where'd you leave it?

23:30.643 --> 23:31.844
Beats the hell out of me.

23:34.347 --> 23:35.681
Is your backpack in your car?

23:35.681 --> 23:38.584
- Yeah, why?
- Is your computer in your backpack?

23:38.584 --> 23:39.919
Mm-hmm.

23:41.687 --> 23:43.222
(at same time) Find my device.

23:43.222 --> 23:47.222
Oh, I am dazzled by your insanely
clever problem-solving skills.

23:48.060 --> 23:51.197
Yeah, they're nothing
compared to my breasts.

23:51.197 --> 23:52.732
(clears throat)

23:52.732 --> 23:54.634
- Yeah, they're so spectacular.
- (laughs)

23:55.601 --> 23:57.637
(music playing over radio)

24:01.941 --> 24:03.576
(Wes humming)

24:04.610 --> 24:06.045
I'm sorry.

24:06.045 --> 24:08.281
Maddie: No, it's cool. I'm almost done.

24:12.818 --> 24:16.622
"There is a wisdom that is woe,
but there is a woe that is madness."

24:16.622 --> 24:17.657
Huh?

24:18.658 --> 24:19.892
The book.

24:24.730 --> 24:26.165
Look, I have to get out of here.

24:26.165 --> 24:28.801
I need to get some nail
polish. Do you want to come?

24:30.636 --> 24:32.038
Um, it's after curfew.

24:32.038 --> 24:33.739
- So...
- Hm.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.145
Do I look like a girl who obeys curfews?

24:40.313 --> 24:43.149
Well, I guess you wouldn't
be in here if you did, huh?

24:43.149 --> 24:44.717
Mm-mm.

24:46.719 --> 24:50.323
(clears throat) Look, I'm
climbing the walls here,

24:50.323 --> 24:53.826
so I don't care where
we go, I just need to go.

24:54.827 --> 24:55.962
Anywhere.

24:57.763 --> 25:01.567
I'm a little all over the place, so you
can come or not. Just don't tell, okay?

25:04.570 --> 25:06.772
There's a hole in the back fence.
We'd have to crawl through it.

25:11.043 --> 25:12.912
- You really want to do this?
- Mm-hmm.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.652
You're gonna be trouble.

25:26.158 --> 25:28.194
So what's the deal with you and Rebecca?

25:28.194 --> 25:30.763
Ugh, we used to be best friends.

25:30.763 --> 25:34.300
It's all very "teen girl
drama-rama." Too angsty to get into.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.702
Fair enough. We should probably get back.

25:37.737 --> 25:40.806
You've obviously never been
shopping with a girl before.

25:40.806 --> 25:41.907
Obviously not.

25:41.907 --> 25:46.212
So, how did you end up at
good old Sunshine Valley,

25:46.212 --> 25:48.280
or Springtime Mausoleum.
Whatever it's called.

25:49.281 --> 25:50.683
Which time?

25:51.784 --> 25:54.620
Oh, it's too angsty to go into.

25:55.621 --> 25:56.989
TouchÃƒÂ©.

25:58.157 --> 26:00.893
We should stick to the basics.
What's your favorite color?

26:00.893 --> 26:02.662
What's your lucky number?

26:02.662 --> 26:04.330
What do you want to be when you grow up?

26:04.330 --> 26:08.330
(laughs) Blood red, 24,

26:08.734 --> 26:10.002
mortician.

26:11.203 --> 26:13.839
- Seriously?
- True story.

26:13.839 --> 26:17.009
The first funeral I ever
went to was my dad's.

26:18.044 --> 26:19.645
Wes: I'm sorry.

26:19.645 --> 26:23.749
The funeral directors were
really nice and caring.

26:23.749 --> 26:26.185
They made something so unbearable,

26:26.185 --> 26:28.220
not exactly bearable, but less bad.

26:29.221 --> 26:31.724
That's what I want to do too,

26:31.724 --> 26:33.225
make things a little less bad for people.

26:35.861 --> 26:39.265
I'm sorry, I've never
told anyone that before,

26:39.265 --> 26:41.634
and that is creepy and morbid.

26:41.634 --> 26:43.202
It's not.

26:44.737 --> 26:45.905
It's really not.

26:47.673 --> 26:49.341
What do you think?

26:49.341 --> 26:51.844
- Come on, eh?
- Smile, you're on camera.

26:51.844 --> 26:53.212
Oh yeah.

26:57.149 --> 26:59.719
- (cans opening)
- (choral music)

27:01.587 --> 27:04.023
Come on. It's kind of funny.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.658
Right?

27:07.293 --> 27:09.228
Yeah, I'll see you outside.

27:16.268 --> 27:19.105
Whoa, hold up there, hoss.

27:19.105 --> 27:20.573
Look what I got us.

27:22.775 --> 27:24.643
Ta-da.

27:24.643 --> 27:28.914
Courtesy of Jocelyn Berman's
slightly older sister, Eloise,

27:28.914 --> 27:30.282
who kind of looks like me but...

27:30.282 --> 27:31.317
You're kidding me, right?

27:31.317 --> 27:33.719
- What?
- I'm committed to my recovery this time.

27:33.719 --> 27:35.321
- Why the hell do you think I'm here?
- Okay.

27:35.321 --> 27:37.189
Never mind.

27:39.024 --> 27:40.693
It's a joke.

27:40.693 --> 27:43.362
Look. Look, I'm getting rid of it.

27:43.362 --> 27:45.765
All right? Look.

27:46.699 --> 27:48.367
I'm sorry. I'm a jerk.

27:53.706 --> 27:57.576
Thank you for saving me from the
evil forces of the drug store.

28:00.045 --> 28:01.180
No worries.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.715
(tires screech)

28:12.258 --> 28:13.759
Okay.

28:20.266 --> 28:21.734
Well, this is bad.

28:22.735 --> 28:24.603
I think you've just set
a record, breaking rules

28:24.603 --> 28:25.604
on your second night here, Maddie.

28:25.604 --> 28:28.874
Just don't kick him out. It was my idea.

28:28.874 --> 28:30.176
He was just protecting me.

28:30.176 --> 28:31.977
Okay.

28:31.977 --> 28:33.946
Okay, Maddie, why don't you
go upstairs, pack your bags,

28:33.946 --> 28:35.581
and I'll call your mom to come pick you up.

28:35.581 --> 28:38.317
Ms. Molina can make arrangements
for your expulsion from Parsons-Bell.

28:38.317 --> 28:40.352
- You can't do...
- Neither of us is leaving.

28:42.688 --> 28:43.656
Right, Craig?

28:57.670 --> 28:59.872
I need you to pee in this cup.

28:59.872 --> 29:01.273
Okay, Maddie?

29:01.273 --> 29:03.142
And this is going to be your only warning.

29:03.142 --> 29:04.143
Do you hear me?

29:05.144 --> 29:07.613
- Yeah.
- Go on, go.

29:07.613 --> 29:08.747
Go.

29:11.717 --> 29:12.651
Where do you think you're going?

29:15.221 --> 29:16.989
Not good, Maddie.

29:16.989 --> 29:20.125
Wes is my sponsee. I can't have
him participating in reckless...

29:20.125 --> 29:21.694
I know, I messed up.

29:21.694 --> 29:22.628
He...

29:23.762 --> 29:25.364
You'll get the hang of this, okay?

29:25.364 --> 29:26.632
It's like riding a bike.

29:26.632 --> 29:28.100
I don't know how to ride a bike.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.235
What?

29:29.235 --> 29:32.238
I fell off the first time I tried,
and it just seemed easier to walk.

29:32.238 --> 29:34.707
And your parents didn't
make you get back on?

29:34.707 --> 29:35.808
Workaholics.

29:35.808 --> 29:38.577
Okay, well, I'm going to teach you.

29:38.577 --> 29:41.247
I didn't always look like this,
you know. I used to be a dancer.

29:42.248 --> 29:43.349
Hmm.

29:45.918 --> 29:47.753
Wow.

29:47.753 --> 29:49.855
- Dude, you were hot.
- I'm still hot.

29:52.691 --> 29:54.593
You don't even know me.

29:54.593 --> 29:55.728
Why do you care?

29:57.029 --> 30:00.299
One day, you're going to have a
moment like this with someone else,

30:00.299 --> 30:02.201
sharing your experience.

30:02.201 --> 30:04.770
That's how it works.

30:04.770 --> 30:06.005
And it does work.

30:19.285 --> 30:20.586
Yeah!

30:20.586 --> 30:22.187
Yeah.

30:29.662 --> 30:31.030
Wes, you bailed me out once.

30:33.599 --> 30:34.733
Now, I've returned that favor.

30:37.569 --> 30:40.239
Are you sure you want to use that
get-out-of-jail-free card on this girl?

30:42.942 --> 30:44.143
Yeah.

30:45.110 --> 30:46.245
I'm worried.

30:46.245 --> 30:49.214
- Don't be.
- I can tell you like her, Wes.

30:49.214 --> 30:52.084
And that means you are potentially
putting your sobriety at risk,

30:52.084 --> 30:53.285
as well as Maddie's.

30:54.653 --> 30:56.689
I think you're overreacting.

30:56.689 --> 30:58.357
No.

30:58.357 --> 30:59.725
You told me

30:59.725 --> 31:02.661
that you were going to follow
every part of the program this time.

31:02.661 --> 31:04.830
And that means no dating the first year.

31:04.830 --> 31:08.167
- I'm not dating her man.
- It's the only way that your recovery

31:08.167 --> 31:09.702
is going to take top priority.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.639
So you and Maddie can't happen.

31:15.641 --> 31:16.575
We clear?

31:17.743 --> 31:19.611
Yeah.

31:19.611 --> 31:21.080
We're clear.

31:28.354 --> 31:29.955
(door closes)

31:33.092 --> 31:34.994
- Hey, sorry about last night.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

31:34.994 --> 31:38.230
- How did you even manage...
- I can't really talk right now.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.631
I have to go. I'm sorry.

31:39.631 --> 31:41.233
Sorry.

31:50.109 --> 31:51.310
Found it.

31:52.578 --> 31:55.681
I'm gonna give you a
free pass on explaining

31:55.681 --> 31:57.816
why your car was parked
on the west side of town

31:57.816 --> 31:59.718
or how you got home.

31:59.718 --> 32:01.253
Thanks.

32:03.822 --> 32:05.357
How's the...

32:06.658 --> 32:08.127
How are you?

32:08.127 --> 32:10.729
Um... (clears throat)

32:13.632 --> 32:16.101
"Damp and drizzly."

32:23.609 --> 32:25.611
You're gonna get through this.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.679
We're gonna get through this.

32:32.618 --> 32:33.952
I...

32:35.788 --> 32:39.858
found this on the front seat of your car.

32:42.061 --> 32:44.763
I'm glad that you and Zack are being safe.

32:49.835 --> 32:52.938
Yeah. Right.

32:52.938 --> 32:55.040
You know, Maddie, you can talk to me...

32:55.040 --> 32:56.642
I have to go.

32:56.642 --> 32:59.078
Um...

32:59.078 --> 33:01.013
I have things to do inside.

33:01.013 --> 33:03.082
So, I'll see you later.

33:10.756 --> 33:12.925
Trish: Come on, Maddie. We're
going to be late for the AA meeting.

33:13.959 --> 33:15.127
- (Maddie crying)
- Trish: Maddie?

33:15.127 --> 33:16.161
No, I'm fine.

33:16.161 --> 33:17.930
Please, no.

33:17.930 --> 33:19.698
No, what happened?

33:21.633 --> 33:22.835
(crying) I don't know.

33:25.604 --> 33:28.574
This... this was in my car.

33:30.175 --> 33:32.744
I don't... I don't remember.

33:33.912 --> 33:36.348
I don't remember what
happened on Thursday night.

33:37.616 --> 33:38.951
And I've never...

33:39.985 --> 33:42.121
(crying) I've never had sex before.

33:43.655 --> 33:46.191
And if I did, it wasn't with my boyfriend,

33:46.191 --> 33:50.191
because he was babysitting
his brother on Thursday.

33:52.064 --> 33:53.765
(sobbing)

33:53.765 --> 33:57.169
What if I cheated on
Zack with some stranger?

34:00.772 --> 34:03.175
Maddie, if you were too drunk to remember,

34:03.175 --> 34:04.576
then it wasn't consensual.

34:04.576 --> 34:05.911
But that's the thing.

34:05.911 --> 34:07.613
What if I initiated it?

34:10.649 --> 34:12.050
(sobbing)

34:12.050 --> 34:13.685
What if I was...

34:14.953 --> 34:17.623
(voice breaking) What if I was raped?

34:17.623 --> 34:19.591
I don't know!

34:19.591 --> 34:21.025
I can't remember.

34:21.025 --> 34:22.694
What if this wasn't the first time?

34:24.163 --> 34:26.130
(crying continues)

34:26.130 --> 34:28.800
I don't know. I can't remember.

34:28.800 --> 34:32.170
- Maddie. It's okay, it's okay.
- (crying heavily)

34:33.237 --> 34:34.973
It's okay.

34:36.241 --> 34:37.775
(sobbing heavily)

34:39.978 --> 34:41.213
(people chatting)

34:41.213 --> 34:42.947
Just mingle, ya hear, Maddie?

34:42.947 --> 34:44.315
Mmm, yeah.

34:45.717 --> 34:48.187
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hi!

34:58.130 --> 35:01.166
Maddie, there's somebody that
I really want you to meet.

35:01.166 --> 35:03.202
Okay, I think you're going to love her.

35:03.202 --> 35:04.703
Her and I have been best friends forever,

35:04.703 --> 35:07.706
and she has really been through it.

35:07.706 --> 35:10.909
But she's so sweet, and I really think
that maybe you could open up to her

35:10.909 --> 35:12.711
more than you could with Wiener Dog.

35:12.711 --> 35:14.012
That's my nickname for Craig.

35:14.012 --> 35:15.147
(laughs)

35:18.617 --> 35:20.686
I'm Cynthia.

35:20.686 --> 35:21.620
Nice to meet you.

35:30.028 --> 35:31.997
- I can't believe you.
- Maddie, I understand you're upset.

35:31.997 --> 35:33.799
Don't you think it's a
little hypocritical of you

35:33.799 --> 35:35.334
to call me out when you're an addict too?

35:36.768 --> 35:38.337
Did you hear what you just did?

35:38.337 --> 35:39.905
- Called you out.
- Nope.

35:39.905 --> 35:43.575
You just admitted you were an addict,
albeit accidentally, but it still counts.

35:43.575 --> 35:44.910
Whatever.

35:44.910 --> 35:47.107
- I'm 12 years sober, Maddie...
- And this is something

35:47.108 --> 35:48.108
you could have brought up many times.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.749
The program works because of its anonymity.

35:50.749 --> 35:54.286
Fine, but if one person
finds out about my situation,

35:54.286 --> 35:55.621
Cynthia,

35:55.621 --> 35:58.657
believe you me, the entire
school will find out about yours.

36:02.794 --> 36:04.196
(sighs)

36:11.003 --> 36:12.704
Hey, it's me. Are you home?

36:14.640 --> 36:16.241
How is she?

36:16.241 --> 36:18.176
She's fine.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.878
Pissed at me.

36:19.878 --> 36:22.047
But I expected she would be.

36:22.047 --> 36:25.083
- She's going to be okay though.
- Voilà.

36:26.118 --> 36:27.986
Oh wow.

36:27.986 --> 36:30.689
I cleaned her room today.
This is what I found.

36:32.291 --> 36:34.626
I didn't realize it had gotten this bad.

36:35.994 --> 36:37.596
How could I not have known?

36:41.099 --> 36:42.734
Jamie would have known.

36:44.269 --> 36:46.305
He always knew what was going on with her.

36:46.305 --> 36:48.106
It's like he had this sixth sense.

36:49.308 --> 36:50.842
(sighs)

36:50.842 --> 36:52.811
First time she had a crush
on a boy, he called it.

36:54.046 --> 36:56.782
The first time she smoked pot,
he was the one who busted her.

36:59.584 --> 37:00.719
They got each other.

37:02.821 --> 37:04.156
She told him things.

37:06.291 --> 37:08.860
And I try, but we just don't.

37:14.599 --> 37:18.236
Maddie can't ever find out that I was
the one who told you to search her locker.

37:18.236 --> 37:19.738
Of course not.

37:22.841 --> 37:26.178
Trish: It's true. My dream in life is to be

37:26.178 --> 37:27.346
on a reality show.

37:27.346 --> 37:30.015
Trish, that's actually
worse than being an addict.

37:30.015 --> 37:32.217
I'm gonna remind you you said that

37:32.217 --> 37:34.853
when I am rich and famous,
and all of America loves me.

37:34.853 --> 37:37.089
(giggling)

37:37.089 --> 37:38.957
Doug?

37:38.957 --> 37:41.827
- What are you doing here?
- I just came back to say hi to my junkie friends.

37:43.095 --> 37:44.162
- Hi.
- Craig!

37:44.162 --> 37:45.697
I just came to say hi.

37:45.697 --> 37:47.099
Come here.

37:47.099 --> 37:49.034
Hi. I remember you.

37:49.034 --> 37:50.836
- Do you remember me?
- Doug, how did you get in?

37:50.836 --> 37:53.105
There's a hole in the back fence.

37:53.105 --> 37:54.573
Craig: Let go of her.

37:54.573 --> 37:56.308
- I just came to say hi.
- Let Rebecca go.

37:56.308 --> 37:58.043
- Douglas, let go.
- Hey, get back!

37:58.043 --> 38:01.146
You guys think you're so frickin' great.

38:01.146 --> 38:02.848
Just 'cause you're all clean and stuff!

38:05.684 --> 38:06.952
Don't you?

38:06.952 --> 38:08.320
(Rebecca screaming)

38:08.320 --> 38:09.588
Douglas, listen to me.

38:09.588 --> 38:10.689
- No!
- What?

38:10.689 --> 38:12.724
We do not have that in here.

38:12.724 --> 38:15.327
- Yes we do!
- Craig: You need to calm down.

38:15.327 --> 38:18.730
You want to come party with me?
All these people think we're losers,

38:18.730 --> 38:20.098
but we're different.

38:20.098 --> 38:22.200
Okay, okay, Douglas. You have it your way.

38:22.200 --> 38:25.570
Rebecca, I'd like you to go
with Doug. Go on, go with him.

38:25.570 --> 38:27.939
Go on, go. Take her. Take Rebecca.

38:27.939 --> 38:29.975
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Go on.

38:29.975 --> 38:33.345
- Okay.
- All right, let's get out of here.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.615
(shouting)

38:37.983 --> 38:39.584
Trish, call 911 please.

38:39.584 --> 38:41.920
- Hey. Hey. Hey.
- (Douglas screaming)

38:41.920 --> 38:43.054
Are you okay?

38:44.055 --> 38:45.257
I think so.

38:45.257 --> 38:47.192
- (shouting continues)
- Craig: All right.

38:49.995 --> 38:52.063
(police radio chatter)

38:57.035 --> 38:59.237
I really thought he was going to make it.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.107
Yeah, me too.

39:02.107 --> 39:04.242
What's going to happen to him?

39:04.242 --> 39:05.977
He's had a lot of chances.

39:05.977 --> 39:07.846
I don't think he's going to
get off so easy this time.

39:07.846 --> 39:10.015
He's not a bad guy.

39:11.116 --> 39:12.818
Really, he's not.

39:12.818 --> 39:14.352
This sucks.

39:15.720 --> 39:17.222
You know, that could have been me.

39:17.222 --> 39:18.223
Yeah.

39:19.224 --> 39:20.792
Margarita: That could
have been any one of us.

39:20.792 --> 39:23.228
(radio chatter)

39:23.228 --> 39:26.198
Oh my god. Oh my god, are you okay?

39:26.198 --> 39:28.633
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

39:28.633 --> 39:30.302
All right, pack your bags. We're leaving.

39:30.302 --> 39:31.937
We're going to find you
a teen treatment center.

39:31.937 --> 39:34.339
No, I...

39:39.611 --> 39:41.046
I think I should stay here.

39:42.214 --> 39:43.348
(radio chatter)

39:49.955 --> 39:52.290
(rock music playing)

40:03.768 --> 40:07.005
â™ª Time moves slowly â™ª

40:07.005 --> 40:08.940
â™ª I'm watching my feet â™ª

40:08.940 --> 40:12.244
â™ª I'm watching my feet as I'm falling â™ª

40:13.678 --> 40:15.146
â™ª Into the moment â™ª

40:15.146 --> 40:17.682
(Maddie reading)

40:26.024 --> 40:28.059
Maddie's voice:... touchy-feely B.S.

40:31.062 --> 40:33.098
But I can do this.

40:33.098 --> 40:36.701
It's only 86 more days,
and then I get my life back.

40:36.701 --> 40:40.205
â™ª I couldn't rely on love â™ª

40:40.205 --> 40:42.073
Maddie's voice: I can do this.

40:45.010 --> 40:46.811
I made a mistake.

40:46.811 --> 40:48.647
A series of them.

40:48.647 --> 40:50.949
Some I don't even remember.

40:51.983 --> 40:53.718
But don't we all?

40:57.355 --> 41:00.992
But if being a big old mess of a
teenager has taught me anything,

41:00.992 --> 41:04.262
it's that there's nothing you
can do that can't be undone.

41:05.697 --> 41:06.798
Right?

41:06.798 --> 41:09.219
Even the things you know you need to fix

41:09.220 --> 41:11.640
that you constantly say
you'll get around to.

41:13.672 --> 41:15.574
Who am I kidding?

41:15.574 --> 41:17.275
Sometimes we do screw up.

41:18.610 --> 41:19.978
Irreparably.

41:22.647 --> 41:24.749
â™ª Everything's changing â™ª

41:24.749 --> 41:28.086
Maddie's voice: But
messes can be cleaned up.

41:30.255 --> 41:34.059
â™ª And everything changes â™ª

41:34.059 --> 41:36.695
â™ª Everything's changing â™ª

41:36.695 --> 41:39.097
â™ª Everything's changing â™ª

41:39.097 --> 41:42.267
Maddie's voice: A wise man once
said, "There's wisdom that is woe,

41:42.267 --> 41:43.802
"but there is a woe that is madness."

41:45.270 --> 41:47.138
I don't know about the wisdom part,

41:47.138 --> 41:49.574
but the madness is definitely setting in.

41:52.611 --> 41:54.346
