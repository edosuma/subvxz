01:39.265 --> 01:41.290
Ozzie. Come on in.

01:42.535 --> 01:44.264
Palmer. What's up?

01:44.370 --> 01:46.497
You know Peck
and Olson.

01:46.639 --> 01:50.075
Peck, yes, hiya.
Olson, by reputation.

01:52.645 --> 01:54.510
I'm Osborne Cox.

01:54.581 --> 01:55.843
Yeah, hi.

01:56.716 --> 01:58.445
Aren't you with...
Isn't he...

01:58.518 --> 02:00.918
Yeah, that's right.
Have a seat.

02:02.155 --> 02:04.007
Look, Oz,
look.

02:04.424 --> 02:06.585
There's no easy
way to say this.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.223
We're taking you off
the Balkans desk.

02:10.830 --> 02:13.424
What? Why?

02:13.500 --> 02:16.628
In fact, we're moving you
out of SIGINT entirely.

02:17.370 --> 02:20.897
Just... No discussion?
Just "You're out"?

02:21.007 --> 02:23.976
Well, we're having
the discussion now.

02:24.043 --> 02:28.844
Look, Oz, this doesn't
have to be unpleasant.

02:30.183 --> 02:32.708
Palmer,
with all due respect,

02:33.319 --> 02:36.345
what the fuck are
you talking about?

02:36.422 --> 02:38.481
And why is
Olson here?

02:39.859 --> 02:40.883
Ozzie, look...

02:40.960 --> 02:42.120
What the fuck
is this?

02:42.195 --> 02:43.992
I know it's not my work.
- Ozzie.

02:44.063 --> 02:45.428
I'm a great
fucking analyst.

02:45.498 --> 02:46.829
Okay, Ozzie.

02:46.900 --> 02:51.735
Ozzie, things have not been
going well, as you know.

02:51.804 --> 02:54.068
You have
a drinking problem.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.974
I have a drinking problem?

03:03.049 --> 03:05.574
This doesn't have
to be unpleasant.

03:06.319 --> 03:09.811
We found something for
you in State. It's a...

03:11.824 --> 03:14.190
Well, it is a lower
clearance level. Yes.

03:14.260 --> 03:19.425
But it's not...
Look, we're not terminating you.

03:19.766 --> 03:20.858
Hmm.

03:20.934 --> 03:23.334
This is an assault.

03:23.503 --> 03:25.937
I have a drinking problem?

03:26.039 --> 03:28.166
Fuck you, Peck. You're a Mormon!
- Ozzie.

03:28.274 --> 03:31.038
Next to you, we all have
a drinking problem!

03:31.110 --> 03:36.446
What the fuck is this?
Whose ass didn't I kiss? Huh?

03:36.549 --> 03:38.210
Let's be honest!
- Okay...

03:38.284 --> 03:41.310
I mean, let us
be fucking honest.

03:41.421 --> 03:45.824
This is a crucifixion!
This is political!

03:45.925 --> 03:48.291
And don't tell me it's not!

03:49.429 --> 03:51.624
I have
a drinking problem!

04:04.811 --> 04:06.369
You're home.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.712
Honey, hang on to your hat.
I've got some news.

04:09.782 --> 04:11.044
Did you pick up
the cheeses?

04:11.117 --> 04:12.243
Huh?

04:12.452 --> 04:13.783
The cheeses?
Were they ready?

04:13.853 --> 04:14.911
The cheeses?

04:14.988 --> 04:17.252
I didn't realize you
could be home so early.

04:17.322 --> 04:20.291
Yeah. I left a message for
you to stop by Arnaud's.

04:20.392 --> 04:22.122
The Magruders and the Pfarrers
are coming this evening.

04:22.228 --> 04:25.391
The Pfarrers...
What did Kathleen say?

04:26.065 --> 04:27.191
What?

04:27.267 --> 04:28.962
When you left
the message?

04:29.702 --> 04:31.294
That she would
give you the message.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.564
Well, I don't know, I guess
we had bigger news today.

04:33.673 --> 04:35.436
My day didn't revolve
around whether...

04:35.508 --> 04:37.066
Do you mean that you
didn't pick up the cheeses?

04:37.176 --> 04:38.575
Well, if I didn't
get the message,

04:38.645 --> 04:39.771
then I didn't pick up
the cheeses.

04:39.846 --> 04:41.609
For fuck's sake, Ozzie.
But, honey, hang on to your hat.

04:41.681 --> 04:43.672
What, now I have to go and pick them up?
- I have some news to...

04:43.783 --> 04:45.580
Stay here
and get dressed.

04:45.652 --> 04:46.983
Honey,
we have to talk.

04:47.053 --> 04:51.217
Well, not now. I mean, they're
gonna be here in less than an hour.

04:53.192 --> 04:54.625
Is that goat cheese?

04:54.694 --> 04:57.390
Chèvre, yes,
that is a goat cheese.

04:57.463 --> 05:00.330
'Cause I have a lactose reflux,
and I can't...

05:00.400 --> 05:02.061
You're lactose
intolerant?

05:02.168 --> 05:04.136
Yeah, but I...
- Or you have acid reflux?

05:04.203 --> 05:06.171
They're different things.
- I know what they are.

05:06.272 --> 05:07.534
So you misspoke.

05:07.607 --> 05:09.438
Well, thank you
for correcting me.

05:09.509 --> 05:11.807
You should try the chèvre, Harry.
It's very good.

05:11.878 --> 05:13.209
Yeah. I can
eat goat cheese.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.474
I was just telling your
husband that I have a condition

05:15.548 --> 05:18.381
where I go into
anaphylactic shock when I...

05:18.484 --> 05:20.645
Harry works in the Marshals Service, Doug.
- And my throat...

05:20.720 --> 05:22.654
Oh! I'm on
the legislative side.

05:22.722 --> 05:24.952
I work with
Senator Hobby.

05:25.024 --> 05:26.992
I was with Treasury, dealing
with Homeland Security.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.322
I'm with the Marshals now.

05:28.394 --> 05:30.862
If you want, he'll show
you his great big gun.

05:32.198 --> 05:34.962
Very funny.
Gun's no big deal.

05:35.401 --> 05:37.562
Twenty years of Marshals Service,
I never discharged my weapon.

05:37.837 --> 05:41.204
That sounds like something you
should be telling your psychiatrist.

05:41.274 --> 05:43.708
I don't have
a psychiatrist.

05:44.377 --> 05:47.210
Boy, I guess my job
is pretty undramatic.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.407
I'm on
the legislative side.

05:49.482 --> 05:50.676
Mrs. Pfarrer,
what do you do?

05:50.750 --> 05:51.876
Do you also
carry a big gun?

05:53.186 --> 05:54.551
No, I write children's...

05:54.620 --> 05:56.349
She writes
children's books.

05:56.422 --> 05:59.880
Yeah. <i>Oliver, The Cat</i>
<i>Who Lives In The Rotunda.</i>

05:59.959 --> 06:01.119
Those are wonderful!
- Thank you.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.354
My nieces and nephews
just love them.

06:02.462 --> 06:03.861
Oh! Yeah, it's a
beloved, beloved series.

06:03.996 --> 06:05.395
Oh! Thank you.

06:05.498 --> 06:07.193
You should see
the fan mail she gets.

06:08.067 --> 06:09.091
Are you sure
this is goat cheese?

06:09.202 --> 06:11.670
Why don't you let your wife tell
them about her own books, Harry?

06:11.738 --> 06:13.501
Come with me into the kitchen.
- I'm sorry. Was I dominating?

06:13.573 --> 06:14.870
Help with
the crudités.

06:18.578 --> 06:22.070
God damn it. He knows, doesn't he?
These are nice floors.

06:22.181 --> 06:25.014
Knows what?
- About us, he knows about us.

06:25.084 --> 06:26.551
Little prick.
- Don't be such an ass.

06:26.619 --> 06:28.348
He doesn't know
a thing.

06:30.089 --> 06:32.023
What is that, Forbo?

06:38.598 --> 06:40.259
What a horse's ass.

06:40.366 --> 06:41.993
I don't know why
we see them.

06:42.168 --> 06:43.795
Well, she's all right.

06:45.104 --> 06:47.436
She's a cold,
stuck-up bitch.

06:54.347 --> 06:55.439
You quit?

06:55.515 --> 06:56.880
Uh-huh.

06:56.949 --> 06:58.246
Well, thank you
for telling me.

06:58.317 --> 06:59.545
Well, I tried to
tell you this...

06:59.685 --> 07:00.845
You tried?
You tried?

07:00.920 --> 07:02.854
And then what,
aphasia kicked in?

07:02.922 --> 07:04.913
No. Then our guests
came and then...

07:05.024 --> 07:07.788
Why? For fuck's sake, Ozzie.
- I don't know.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.885
I just got so tired.

07:09.962 --> 07:11.122
You're tired?

07:11.197 --> 07:13.631
Yes, of swimming
against the current.

07:13.733 --> 07:15.030
Uh-huh.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.694
Independent thought
is not valued there.

07:18.805 --> 07:22.138
They resist it. They fight it.
The bureaucracy is...

07:22.241 --> 07:25.176
So they gave you a pension
or severance or something?

07:25.278 --> 07:29.009
I didn't retire. I quit.
I don't want their benefits.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.447
But my benefits, they
will do you, right?

07:31.517 --> 07:33.815
They'll see you through,
is that the idea?

07:33.920 --> 07:36.989
It's not like that's the
only way to make money.

07:37.024 --> 07:39.423
Yes? Yes? Well,
what're you gonna do?

07:39.492 --> 07:41.892
I'll do some consulting.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.485
Consulting.

07:43.930 --> 07:49.664
Yes, to help out while...
I've always wanted to write.

07:51.170 --> 07:53.638
Write. Write what?

07:55.141 --> 07:59.475
I've been thinking
about writing a book.

07:59.545 --> 08:03.413
Or, you know,
a sort of memoir.

08:17.029 --> 08:18.792
You okay there, Dad?

08:29.475 --> 08:31.841
Dad, I left my job
at the Agency.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.710
I'm sorry, Dad.

08:41.821 --> 08:47.157
Government service is not the
same as when you were in State.

08:47.994 --> 08:49.859
Things are different now.

08:50.663 --> 08:55.157
I don't know, maybe it's
the Cold War ending.

08:57.236 --> 09:01.764
Now it seems like it's all
bureaucracy and no mission.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.034
I'm writing a memoir.

09:07.713 --> 09:11.911
I think it can be
pretty explosive.

09:12.018 --> 09:14.418
But I don't think
you would disapprove.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.988
I don't think you
would disapprove.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.751
Katie's had trouble
accepting it.

09:18.858 --> 09:22.191
But sometimes there's
a higher patriotism, Dad.

09:39.245 --> 09:42.078
I know this kind of man.
We've seen this.

09:42.949 --> 09:45.349
Mrs. Cox,
you cannot let this man

09:45.418 --> 09:48.285
take advantage of you,
and he will.

09:48.354 --> 09:49.412
He will.

09:49.488 --> 09:51.080
Yes. This is my fear.

09:51.157 --> 09:53.284
Though he's trying...
Well, he says

09:53.359 --> 09:55.088
he's trying to pull
himself together but...

09:55.161 --> 10:00.861
Yeah. Look, sure, I'm obliged to
tell you to try to salvage things,

10:01.000 --> 10:03.798
and you should.
It's not unheard of

10:03.903 --> 10:06.804
that people turn
themselves around,

10:06.872 --> 10:11.969
but you haven't broached the
possibility of divorce yet.

10:12.044 --> 10:13.978
No.
- Well, that's good.

10:14.046 --> 10:18.244
Because first you should get his
financials before he's forewarned.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.342
Because here is a man...

10:20.419 --> 10:23.684
Here is a man
practiced in deceit.

10:23.756 --> 10:26.224
This was almost,
you could say, it's his job,

10:26.359 --> 10:28.827
and there is no reason
it's not improper.

10:29.395 --> 10:34.492
There is no reason you shouldn't get
a picture of the household finances.

10:34.567 --> 10:39.197
Paper files, computer files, whatever.
That's your prerogative.

10:40.039 --> 10:42.974
You can be a spy,
too, madam.

10:44.243 --> 10:46.711
Do this,
before he's put on alert.

10:46.779 --> 10:51.307
Before the turtle can
draw in his head and his...

10:52.718 --> 10:54.276
Feet.
- Feet.

10:54.887 --> 10:56.787
And hopefully
everything will work out.

10:56.856 --> 10:58.517
He will reform.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.820
But if not,

11:02.061 --> 11:04.894
forewarned is forearmed.

11:12.705 --> 11:17.472
We were young and committed and
there was nothing we could not do.

11:19.378 --> 11:21.903
We thought of
the Agency less...

11:25.484 --> 11:26.542
Um...

11:28.721 --> 11:32.555
The principles
of George Kennan,

11:33.726 --> 11:35.660
a personal hero of mine,

11:36.595 --> 11:41.089
like the fabled
Murrow's Boys,

11:42.635 --> 11:46.731
at a time of...

11:57.116 --> 11:59.141
<i>You have reached the Cox Group.</i>

11:59.218 --> 12:01.709
<i>We can't answer</i>
<i>your call right...</i>

12:01.787 --> 12:03.482
Hello?

12:03.622 --> 12:05.317
<i>I'm looking for Dr. Cox. Is she there?</i>

12:05.424 --> 12:10.225
No. She isn't.
Hers is the 5719 number.

12:10.296 --> 12:12.230
This is the Cox Group,

12:12.298 --> 12:15.961
but you can reach her on her
portable or at her office.

12:17.503 --> 12:18.629
<i>She's married!</i>

12:19.305 --> 12:20.499
<i>Number four.</i>

12:21.807 --> 12:23.536
<i>Has a boyfriend!</i>

12:23.642 --> 12:24.870
<i>And number six.</i>

12:26.145 --> 12:27.840
<i>She's pregnant!</i>

13:10.856 --> 13:13.051
I should try to
get a run in.

13:15.394 --> 13:16.554
Ozzie!

13:23.068 --> 13:24.501
Ozzie!

14:36.175 --> 14:40.578
<i>Let all with one accord rejoice</i>

14:40.646 --> 14:44.912
<i>In praise of Old Nassau</i>

14:44.984 --> 14:47.680
<i>In praise of Old Nassau,</i>
<i>my boys</i>

14:47.786 --> 14:50.755
<i>Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!</i>

14:50.823 --> 14:56.921
<i>Her sons will give</i>
<i>while they shall live</i>

14:56.996 --> 14:59.829
<i>Three cheers for Old Nassau!</i>

15:04.270 --> 15:07.728
We take all the chicken
fat off your buttocks, here.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.398
Mmm-hmm.

15:11.644 --> 15:14.943
And the upper arms.
- Mmm-hmm.

15:15.014 --> 15:18.450
And a little off your tummy.
- Yeah. Great.

15:18.517 --> 15:21.111
Now, we do
breast augmentation

15:22.121 --> 15:24.521
with a tiny
incision here...

15:24.990 --> 15:26.082
That marker tickles.

15:26.158 --> 15:27.523
...and here.

15:27.626 --> 15:30.527
And what about the upper leg,
the higher inside thigh area?

15:30.629 --> 15:32.494
Well, we can do
liposuction there, as well,

15:32.631 --> 15:34.496
but that area will
respond to exercise.

15:35.801 --> 15:38.429
The buttocks and upper
arms begin to store more fat

15:38.537 --> 15:42.974
once you get up around 40.
The body just tells it to go there,

15:43.042 --> 15:45.738
but the thighs will
respond to toning exercises.

15:45.844 --> 15:48.176
Yeah, I can work on my arms
till the cows come home, but...

15:48.247 --> 15:51.580
Well, also, there are of
course genetic factors.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.151
The Litzkes have
always been big.

15:53.218 --> 15:54.242
Well, everyone's got...

15:54.320 --> 15:56.720
My mother had an ass
that could pull a bus.

15:56.822 --> 15:58.221
Wow! Well, that's a...

15:58.290 --> 15:59.314
Father's side, too.

15:59.391 --> 16:02.087
I mean, although Dad tended to
carry his weight out in front more,

16:02.161 --> 16:03.788
in the gut area.
Derrière, not so much.

16:03.862 --> 16:04.920
Okay.

16:04.997 --> 16:08.296
And what about the face, you know,
the window to the soul?

16:08.400 --> 16:09.628
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

16:09.735 --> 16:11.430
Very well put.

16:11.537 --> 16:16.201
Well, your eyes are one
of your best features,

16:16.842 --> 16:20.744
but we can do something about
the incipient crow's feet.

16:20.846 --> 16:22.746
Baby crow's feet.
Little chickling's feet.

16:22.848 --> 16:24.577
I mean chicks.
Chickie, chickie, chickie.

16:24.683 --> 16:26.981
Yes, again, well put.

16:27.052 --> 16:28.986
You have a way
with words.

16:29.054 --> 16:32.353
We make a small incision
and then pull the skin tight,

16:32.424 --> 16:34.517
like stretching
the skin over a drum.

16:34.593 --> 16:35.651
Not too tight, though.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.821
We don't want that
"worked-on" look.

16:37.896 --> 16:40.364
You need sufficient slack for
the face to remain expressive.

16:40.432 --> 16:42.696
Yeah, I don't wanna
look like Boris Karloff.

16:42.801 --> 16:44.530
So you don't want a sex change!

16:44.636 --> 16:46.365
No, I'm all woman!

16:47.139 --> 16:51.542
So, Linda, what we're talking about
here is four different procedures.

16:52.411 --> 16:55.446
The liposuction,
the rhinoplasty,

16:55.481 --> 16:59.281
the facial tuck, which I would strongly
recommend over the chemical peel.

16:59.385 --> 17:00.852
Yeah, I don't wanna
burn anything off.

17:00.986 --> 17:03.386
And why should you,
with that lovely skin?

17:03.422 --> 17:05.753
And lastly,
the breast augmentation.

17:05.824 --> 17:10.261
Now, we can also do something
about the vaccine scar.

17:11.463 --> 17:14.193
I don't know if you wear
sleeveless dresses much...

17:14.266 --> 17:15.756
Not with these ham hocks!

17:15.867 --> 17:18.928
Yes, well, once they're
nice and svelte, post-op,

17:19.070 --> 17:21.631
you may change
your mind about that.

17:22.407 --> 17:23.965
I wanna talk about
this vaccine thing.

17:24.143 --> 17:25.734
I mean, can you
counsel me on this?

17:25.810 --> 17:27.335
I mean, is it
really that unsightly?

17:27.445 --> 17:29.414
I see... I mean, a bunch
of people have them.

17:29.481 --> 17:31.972
Absolutely!
Some women don't mind it.

17:33.185 --> 17:34.311
It's personal taste.

17:40.592 --> 17:41.991
Chad!

17:42.861 --> 17:44.852
Big breath. Exhale.

17:45.597 --> 17:47.292
Hold it.

17:47.366 --> 17:48.355
Hold and release!

17:48.434 --> 17:49.492
Chad!

17:49.968 --> 17:51.799
And release.

17:53.472 --> 17:54.632
Too much?

17:54.740 --> 17:58.039
I just felt a straining,
a tightness in the front of my ass.

17:58.143 --> 18:00.111
Well, you are pretty
tight down there.

18:00.245 --> 18:01.303
You have to...

18:01.346 --> 18:02.574
Yes, something
snapped in my ass.

18:02.614 --> 18:04.582
<i>Chad Feldheimer to the office, please.</i>

18:04.650 --> 18:06.174
I'm gonna check with my office.
I'll be right back,

18:06.285 --> 18:08.685
and we're gonna work
on opening those hips.

18:12.991 --> 18:15.323
I just got a batch
from BeWithMeDC.com.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.588
Oh, no. Anything good?

18:17.663 --> 18:19.324
I don't know. I'm just
looking. How do I open this?

18:19.431 --> 18:21.023
Click on the...
Click on the... Yeah...

18:21.166 --> 18:22.793
Okay. Oh, my God!

18:22.901 --> 18:24.129
Okay. Loser.

18:25.637 --> 18:27.605
Loser. Loser.

18:28.874 --> 18:31.206
They should
call this Mr. Loser.com.

18:31.310 --> 18:32.504
Did you have to
send in a picture?

18:32.578 --> 18:33.806
No, only the guys do.

18:33.879 --> 18:35.312
I had to fill out
a verbal profile,

18:35.447 --> 18:36.914
what turns me on,
what turns me off.

18:37.015 --> 18:40.348
I'm really looking for a
guy with a sense of humor.

18:40.419 --> 18:42.546
That guy... Wait. That guy wasn't bad.
- Him?

18:42.654 --> 18:44.383
No, before.
- Him?

18:44.490 --> 18:46.549
Yeah... He might
not be a loser.

18:46.625 --> 18:47.785
How can you tell?

18:47.860 --> 18:49.657
That's a Brioni suit.
- Yeah?

18:49.728 --> 18:51.093
Shit, yeah.

18:51.196 --> 18:53.426
Does he look like he would
have a sense of humor?

18:53.532 --> 18:55.727
Looks like his optometrist
has a sense of humor.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.267
What does he do?

18:57.970 --> 18:59.096
State Department.

19:00.372 --> 19:01.771
That's cool.

19:02.241 --> 19:04.471
His hair is...
- What is that?

19:07.913 --> 19:09.312
Plugs?

19:10.849 --> 19:13.545
This is our cardio area, and
we have a lot of machines,

19:13.652 --> 19:15.142
so, believe me,
there's never a wait.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.381
I mean, what you see now
is like our busiest time,

19:17.489 --> 19:19.150
and there's like
a lot of machines open.

19:19.224 --> 19:20.282
Hey, Chad.

19:20.359 --> 19:22.088
Hey, Linda.
Did you call that guy?

19:22.161 --> 19:25.096
No, not yet.
Chad Feldheimer, he's one of our trainers.

19:25.197 --> 19:27.529
I've been doing this Internet
dating thing, and I...

19:27.599 --> 19:28.827
What service?

19:28.901 --> 19:30.334
BeWithMeDC.com.

19:30.435 --> 19:31.993
Nice.
- Have you used them?

19:32.104 --> 19:35.596
No. Two friends did, though,
and they both got hooked up

19:35.741 --> 19:37.504
with really
special guys.

19:37.576 --> 19:39.066
That's fantastic.

19:39.578 --> 19:41.546
<i>If you're an English speaker,
please say, "Yes"...</i>

19:41.613 --> 19:42.637
Yes!

19:42.748 --> 19:44.613
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I didn't understand what you said.</i>

19:44.716 --> 19:46.707
<i>If you're an English speaker...</i>
- English.

19:46.785 --> 19:48.776
<i>Would you like to speak to the
billing department or to an agent?</i>

19:48.887 --> 19:49.911
Agent.

19:49.988 --> 19:51.546
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I didn't understand what you said.</i>

19:51.623 --> 19:54.057
Agent! Agent!

19:55.794 --> 19:56.954
<i>Hello.</i>
<i>Can I help you?</i>

19:57.062 --> 19:59.257
Yeah, hi.
This is Linda Litzke.

19:59.331 --> 20:00.958
Shall I give you
my account number?

20:01.099 --> 20:03.499
<i>You keyed it in. I have it here.</i>
- You have it up? Okay.

20:03.535 --> 20:06.231
I was told that I needed
pre-approval for these surgeries...

20:06.338 --> 20:09.000
<i>Yes, I'm showing that this
procedure was not approved.</i>

20:09.107 --> 20:10.768
Yes, it was denied.

20:10.842 --> 20:13.709
<i>This operation is an elective procedure.</i>
<i>It's not covered by...</i>

20:13.812 --> 20:17.213
No, those are four different operations.
It's very complicated.

20:17.316 --> 20:19.341
I'm reinventing myself.
This is a whole new look,

20:19.451 --> 20:22.511
so it's not just one thing, but
they're all approved by my doctor.

20:22.621 --> 20:24.612
<i>Your doctor's approval</i>
<i>is not the issue, ma'am.</i>

20:24.690 --> 20:26.487
But this is not... Madam.
<i>Our guidelines specify</i>

20:26.558 --> 20:28.185
<i>that elective</i>
<i>surgeries are...</i>

20:28.260 --> 20:30.922
My job involves
public interface.

20:30.996 --> 20:32.793
This is not...
<i>- I'm afraid you don't understand...</i>

20:32.864 --> 20:34.593
Oh! I understand.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.929
Put your supervisor
on, please.

20:37.202 --> 20:38.965
<i>Hold the line.</i>

21:24.750 --> 21:26.081
Alan?

21:27.085 --> 21:28.177
Linda?

21:29.021 --> 21:30.113
Yeah.

21:35.193 --> 21:38.253
<i>We've been over</i>
<i>and over and over this.</i>

21:38.363 --> 21:41.196
<i>First you say you</i>
<i>can't commit, and then...</i>

21:41.266 --> 21:42.790
<i>Would you come</i>
<i>down from there?</i>

23:27.339 --> 23:30.968
We were married when I
was in my, what, mid-20s?

23:31.042 --> 23:32.339
A kid.

23:32.411 --> 23:35.141
We were kids, 20s.

23:35.213 --> 23:37.647
You think it's forever.

23:39.084 --> 23:42.178
You get older, you start
to feel your mortality,

23:42.254 --> 23:44.552
and you say,
"There's no more time for dishonesty,

23:44.656 --> 23:48.319
"for subterfuge."
You say, "I'm not that person."

23:48.860 --> 23:49.884
The choices you make...

23:49.961 --> 23:51.826
I'm thinking of
divorcing Ozzie.

23:57.869 --> 23:59.837
Frankly, I'm thinking...

24:03.308 --> 24:06.766
I guess that's what
I should be thinking, too.

24:06.878 --> 24:08.709
With Sandy.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.805
Well, that's what
you were just saying.

24:10.882 --> 24:12.975
Absolutely, yes.

24:13.051 --> 24:14.848
And you're right.
You should dump that bozo.

24:14.920 --> 24:17.115
No question about it.
I agree.

24:17.789 --> 24:19.484
So if I were divorced...

24:19.558 --> 24:24.188
Yes, I should settle
things with Sandy

24:24.262 --> 24:26.253
because of you and me.
- Mmm-hmm.

24:28.934 --> 24:31.164
It's just, you know...

24:32.804 --> 24:35.705
It's hard to inflict that
kind of pain, you know.

24:36.374 --> 24:39.104
Of course, that would
be easier for you.

24:40.579 --> 24:43.377
Why's that?
I don't see that.

24:43.448 --> 24:45.780
Well, because
he's such a dope,

24:45.884 --> 24:49.911
and Sandy is a good lady.
She's a very special lady.

24:49.988 --> 24:52.218
She's a cold,
stuck-up bitch.

24:52.757 --> 24:54.156
That's a little...

24:54.259 --> 24:55.988
You and I should
get things sorted.

24:56.094 --> 24:58.255
I've always told you
it's more than just frivolity.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.924
That's right. That's understood.
You've been very straight.

25:01.099 --> 25:03.363
And I think I've been
loud and clear.

25:03.401 --> 25:04.891
Absolutely.

25:06.905 --> 25:08.873
Not just fun and games.

25:12.377 --> 25:13.776
Absolutely.

25:33.999 --> 25:35.398
Agent!
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

25:35.467 --> 25:36.991
<i>I didn't understand</i>
<i>what you said.</i>

25:37.135 --> 25:38.295
Agent!

25:42.107 --> 25:43.665
<i>Your call is important to us.</i>

25:43.808 --> 25:46.436
<i> Please stay on the
line for the next available agent.</i>

25:57.155 --> 25:59.817
Ted, can I talk to you
about our Mickey Mouse HMO?

25:59.891 --> 26:00.915
Uh-huh! Hang on.

26:01.059 --> 26:02.219
This is some
heavy shit.

26:02.260 --> 26:03.557
Is that my date list?

26:03.862 --> 26:04.988
No, fuck.

26:05.063 --> 26:07.190
You know, I'm trying to reinvent
myself, and these procedures,

26:07.265 --> 26:09.529
which are so incredibly not cheap...
- What is that?

26:09.634 --> 26:10.794
I can't believe this.

26:10.902 --> 26:12.870
This is like
intelligence shit.

26:12.971 --> 26:13.960
I'm not comfortable
with this.

26:14.105 --> 26:15.629
This is like...
- What is it?

26:15.774 --> 26:17.173
I can't believe
this shit I'm seeing.

26:17.275 --> 26:18.742
Manolo found it.
On the floor there.

26:18.843 --> 26:21.403
Yeah. Manolo found like this
CD just lying in a locker,

26:21.479 --> 26:23.310
a locker floor, ladies' locker.
- Just lying there.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.280
I'm like,
"What, someone's music or what?"

26:25.417 --> 26:27.282
And I come in here,
and it's these files, man.

26:27.385 --> 26:28.579
I'm not comfortable
with this.

26:28.653 --> 26:32.749
Talking about SIGINT
and signals and shit and...

26:32.824 --> 26:33.950
"Signals" means "code,"
you know.

26:34.025 --> 26:35.117
It was just lying there.

26:35.226 --> 26:38.491
Talking here about department
heads and their names and shit.

26:38.597 --> 26:41.760
And then there's these other
files that are just, like, numbers.

26:41.833 --> 26:47.465
Arrayed. Numbers and dates and
numbers and number and dates.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.597
And numbers and...

26:51.142 --> 26:53.440
I think that's
the shit, man.

26:55.447 --> 26:56.971
The raw intelligence.

26:57.115 --> 26:58.673
I'm not touching this.

26:58.783 --> 27:00.011
I want this out of here.

27:00.118 --> 27:01.983
Just throw it out?
- No. You can't do that.

27:02.020 --> 27:03.817
You should put up a note
in the ladies' locker room.

27:03.888 --> 27:05.378
Put up a note?

27:05.457 --> 27:07.789
"Highly classified
shit found?"

27:07.892 --> 27:10.793
"Signals intelligence shit?
CIA shit?"

27:10.895 --> 27:13.955
"Hello! Did anybody lose their secret CIA shit?"
I don't think so.

27:14.065 --> 27:15.259
I don't know,
you figure it out,

27:15.333 --> 27:16.732
but I'm not comfortable
with this,

27:16.835 --> 27:19.065
and I want this
out of Hardbodies.

27:19.170 --> 27:21.502
We're running
a gym here. God.

27:23.775 --> 27:26.039
Manolo, you didn't find this.

27:26.144 --> 27:28.442
I found it on
the floor there.

27:28.947 --> 27:29.971
Yeah, I know, but...

27:30.115 --> 27:31.173
Right there on
the floor there.

27:31.282 --> 27:33.011
Just lying there.

27:59.778 --> 28:00.676
Harry?

28:00.845 --> 28:01.971
Yeah, it's me.

28:24.369 --> 28:25.358
Absolut Saketini,
please.

28:25.537 --> 28:26.526
Just a Tab.

28:26.671 --> 28:28.229
But if I could get
an advance on my salary,

28:28.373 --> 28:29.840
I could at least get
the surgery ball rolling.

28:29.941 --> 28:32.409
Whoa! There's a payroll
company, you know.

28:32.510 --> 28:34.307
They don't just
advance people money.

28:34.446 --> 28:36.243
They just don't do that.

28:36.347 --> 28:38.281
I mean, sure, I could say,
"Yes, I authorize it,"

28:38.383 --> 28:40.908
but that's not going to
mean anything to them.

28:41.019 --> 28:43.180
Then why do they have us on
this cockamamie health plan?

28:43.254 --> 28:44.687
I need those surgeries, Ted.

28:44.823 --> 28:46.290
You're a beautiful woman.
You don't...

28:46.391 --> 28:48.882
I have gone just about as far
as I can go with this body.

28:48.960 --> 28:51.121
I think
it's a beautiful...

28:51.262 --> 28:53.457
It's not a phony-baloney
Hollywood body.

28:53.565 --> 28:56.728
That's right, Ted.
I would be laughed out of Hollywood.

28:56.835 --> 28:59.030
I have very limited
breasts, a ginormous ass,

28:59.137 --> 29:00.399
and I've got this gut
that swings back and forth

29:00.572 --> 29:03.541
in front of me like a shopping
cart with a bent wheel.

29:04.542 --> 29:06.703
You know, there's a lot of guys
that like you just the way you are.

29:06.778 --> 29:08.405
Yeah. Losers.

29:10.882 --> 29:12.873
I don't know.
I mean, am I a loser? Ted.

29:12.951 --> 29:14.919
You know, I wasn't always
a manager at Hardbodies.

29:15.019 --> 29:16.680
Let me tell you...

29:19.858 --> 29:22.224
Let me show you something.

29:28.133 --> 29:29.623
Is that you?

29:30.235 --> 29:35.002
Fourteen years, a Greek Orthodox priest.
Congregation in Chevy Chase.

29:35.106 --> 29:38.075
That's a good job! What happened?
- Mmm-hmm.

29:39.844 --> 29:41.744
It's a long story.

29:43.982 --> 29:45.313
Anyway,

29:46.484 --> 29:49.009
in many ways,
I'm a lot happier now.

29:50.255 --> 29:51.779
My point is...

29:52.323 --> 29:53.756
My point is,
it's a journey.

29:53.825 --> 29:55.793
That's my point.
I don't want to stay where I am.

29:55.860 --> 29:57.794
I want to find someone
to share my journey.

29:57.862 --> 30:01.195
Well, you know, sometimes, if you
don't look in your own back yard...

30:01.332 --> 30:03.926
I know. That's why I
started this Internet dating.

30:04.002 --> 30:07.369
Uh-huh. But what I'm saying is
maybe, you know, you don't have to...

30:07.472 --> 30:10.441
Look, Ted, I know that you can't
authorize an advance on my salary,

30:10.542 --> 30:13.477
but you could put in
a request, can't you?

30:14.846 --> 30:16.336
It's not going to
do any good, Linda.

30:16.414 --> 30:20.145
Ted, have you ever heard of
the power of positive thinking?

30:30.495 --> 30:31.723
Harry?

30:33.498 --> 30:35.090
It's Monica.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.392
Well, hello.

30:45.777 --> 30:47.870
Maybe I can get a run in.

30:56.888 --> 30:58.856
Hello?
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>

31:03.895 --> 31:05.021
Oh, my God.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.458
Oh, my God.

31:10.268 --> 31:11.428
Oh, my God.

31:11.603 --> 31:12.797
Do you know
what time it is?

31:12.904 --> 31:15.168
Uh-huh. So, like,
I couldn't call you

31:15.240 --> 31:16.537
on your totally
unsecure phone,

31:16.608 --> 31:18.769
but I know
who the guy is.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.110
The guy?

31:22.213 --> 31:24.204
The guy, the secret guy.

31:25.550 --> 31:26.812
So, is he high up?

31:26.951 --> 31:28.248
I don't know
if he's high up.

31:28.353 --> 31:31.083
Probably. I mean,
I got his name, not his rank.

31:31.189 --> 31:32.918
So what's his name?

31:33.691 --> 31:35.352
Osborne Cox.

31:36.628 --> 31:38.061
Never heard of him.

31:38.129 --> 31:39.960
Like you're so plugged into

31:40.031 --> 31:41.055
the intelligence community.

31:41.132 --> 31:42.121
I'm just saying
as a layperson...

31:42.200 --> 31:45.567
I think the quality of the
intelligence dictates how high up he is.

31:45.670 --> 31:47.137
Okay.
Not what we know.

31:47.238 --> 31:48.637
I also...

31:48.740 --> 31:51.903
Do you have any water?
I gotta hydrate.

31:51.976 --> 31:53.204
I got tap water.

31:53.344 --> 31:54.572
Are you kidding?

31:54.646 --> 31:56.045
How do you know
who he is?

31:56.481 --> 31:57.573
Sources.

31:57.649 --> 31:58.843
What do
you mean sources?

31:58.950 --> 32:02.215
You got like Gatorade or anything
besides, like, Maryland swamp water?

32:02.287 --> 32:03.584
Do you know how far
this is from my place?

32:03.688 --> 32:05.121
How do you know
his name?

32:05.223 --> 32:07.020
I got this geek friend,
Eddie Gallegos.

32:07.091 --> 32:09.355
He does computer stuff,
hooks up people's computers

32:09.427 --> 32:11.725
and programs
their VCRs and shit.

32:11.796 --> 32:15.391
So he examines the files and pulls off
the digital watermark, which tells you

32:15.466 --> 32:16.865
what computer
it was created on.

32:17.035 --> 32:18.434
Fucking child's play
for Eddie.

32:18.503 --> 32:19.561
Uh-huh.

32:19.671 --> 32:20.865
And...

32:21.739 --> 32:24.765
<i>I got his number, I got his number</i>

32:24.909 --> 32:25.898
Oh, my God.

32:26.010 --> 32:28.001
That was a bit
more difficult.

32:28.079 --> 32:29.341
Shall we give him a tinkle?

32:29.414 --> 32:30.779
Oh, my God.

32:31.582 --> 32:32.810
Why?

32:32.917 --> 32:36.444
'Cause he's gonna wanna know
that his shit is secure.

32:37.021 --> 32:39.251
He's gonna be relieved.

32:39.324 --> 32:42.782
He might even be so relieved
that he gives us a reward.

32:42.860 --> 32:44.987
I would be very fucking
surprised if he did not.

32:45.096 --> 32:46.825
Wow.
- Very surprised.

32:46.931 --> 32:49.195
Like, you know,
the Good Samaritan tax,

32:49.300 --> 32:52.736
which is not even a tax,
really, since it's voluntary.

33:09.520 --> 33:10.782
<i>Hello?</i>

33:13.524 --> 33:16.084
Osborne?
Osborne Cox?

33:16.160 --> 33:17.752
<i>Yes.</i>

33:18.329 --> 33:19.819
<i>Who is this?</i>

33:22.433 --> 33:26.597
This...
Is this Osborne Cox?

33:26.704 --> 33:30.140
<i>Who is this?</i>
<i>What time is it? Who are you?</i>

33:30.208 --> 33:31.266
Um...

33:31.376 --> 33:33.310
I'm a Good Samaritan.

33:34.379 --> 33:37.314
I'm sorry I'm calling
at such an hour,

33:37.382 --> 33:40.579
but I thought you
might be worried.

33:41.686 --> 33:42.710
<i>Worried?</i>

33:42.787 --> 33:46.917
About the security
of your shit.

33:52.163 --> 33:55.064
What on earth are
you talking about?

33:55.867 --> 33:57.698
Who am I speaking to?

33:58.636 --> 34:02.094
Your files. Your...
- The documents.

34:03.241 --> 34:07.644
I know these documents
are sensitive.

34:07.712 --> 34:12.513
But I am perfectly willing to give
back to you your sensitive shit,

34:13.551 --> 34:16.145
you know,
at a time of your choosing.

34:16.219 --> 34:19.018
<i>What documents are</i>
<i>you talking about?</i>

34:20.591 --> 34:21.580
Osborne Cox?

34:21.659 --> 34:23.650
<i> Yes!</i>
<i>Yes, this is...</i>

34:23.728 --> 34:26.925
Hello, it's Osborne Cox.
Who the fuck are you?

34:27.031 --> 34:29.022
<i>What documents are</i>
<i>you talking about?</i>

34:29.100 --> 34:30.158
<i>Who is that?</i>

34:30.268 --> 34:31.496
Okay.

34:33.438 --> 34:37.135
"The bureau chief in Belgrade
we all call Slovak the Butcher.

34:37.241 --> 34:40.472
"He had very little rapport with
his staff and his dispatches..."

34:40.578 --> 34:43.741
Rapport.
"Very little rapport

34:43.815 --> 34:46.215
"with his staff,"
fucking moron!

34:46.284 --> 34:47.614
<i>How did you get this?</i>

34:47.717 --> 34:49.275
Don't blow a gasket,
Osborne.

34:49.420 --> 34:50.978
<i>Who the fuck are you?</i>
<i>Listen to me.</i>

34:51.489 --> 34:53.013
We have...
It's not important where...

34:53.157 --> 34:54.715
<i>You are in way over</i>
<i>your fucking head!</i>

34:54.792 --> 34:56.282
I don't know who
the fuck you are,

34:56.360 --> 34:58.885
but you have no idea
what you're doing!

34:58.963 --> 35:02.364
Oh! Why so uptight,
Osborne Cox?

35:02.433 --> 35:05.664
I'm just a Good Samaritan,
a traveler on the road...

35:05.770 --> 35:06.896
Tell him we're
gonna give it back.

35:07.038 --> 35:08.665
We just thought that he
would like to maybe know,

35:08.773 --> 35:10.832
and tell him about that
Good Samaritan tax thing...

35:10.942 --> 35:12.603
Who is that? Hello?
Ozzie, what's going on?

35:12.710 --> 35:14.905
You tell him he's
inconveniencing us.

35:14.979 --> 35:16.606
<i>Hello!</i>
<i>Who the fuck is this?</i>

35:16.681 --> 35:18.012
<i>Ozzie,</i>
<i>what's going on?</i>

35:18.082 --> 35:21.711
You know, this is a major
inconvenience for us,

35:21.786 --> 35:24.880
and we just
thought a reward...

35:25.490 --> 35:27.583
<i>So it's money! So it's money!</i>

35:27.658 --> 35:28.989
<i>You want money?</i>
<i>Okay. Listen to me.</i>

35:29.060 --> 35:30.527
Well, yeah, why not?

35:31.295 --> 35:32.922
Am I out of line here?
<i>- Let me...</i>

35:33.030 --> 35:35.225
Listen to me,
you two clowns.

35:35.366 --> 35:37.561
Listen to me very,
very carefully.

35:39.070 --> 35:41.971
You have no idea what you're doing,
and I warn you...

35:42.073 --> 35:43.768
You warn us?
You warn us? You warn us?

35:43.908 --> 35:45.603
<i>Yes. Yes. I...</i>

35:45.676 --> 35:48.236
Let me tell you something, Mr. Intelligence.
<i>- Yes. Let me...</i>

35:48.312 --> 35:49.939
We warn you!
<i>- Listen!</i>

35:50.014 --> 35:52.073
We will call you back
with our demands!

35:52.150 --> 35:53.242
<i>Hello? Listen to me.</i>

35:53.384 --> 35:54.476
Chad! Don't you...

35:54.585 --> 35:57.076
No, Chad. Don't play his game!
<i>- Let me explain</i>

35:57.155 --> 35:58.850
<i>how this will work.</i>
- Sorry.

36:01.092 --> 36:03.322
Jeez.
The nerve of that guy!

36:06.063 --> 36:09.863
I am very fucking surprised
he did not give us that reward.

36:10.968 --> 36:12.526
What on earth is going on?

36:12.637 --> 36:17.597
Some clown, or two clowns, have
gotten a hold of my memoirs.

36:17.742 --> 36:19.209
Your what?

36:20.311 --> 36:21.369
Stolen it, or...
I don't know how...

36:21.445 --> 36:22.503
Your what?

36:22.580 --> 36:25.014
My memoirs, the book
that I'm writing.

36:25.816 --> 36:29.650
Well, why in God's name would
anyone think that's worth anything?

36:34.759 --> 36:36.454
It doesn't sound like
he's gonna play ball.

36:36.527 --> 36:38.051
He'll play ball!

36:38.196 --> 36:39.754
We just have to
show him who's boss.

36:39.830 --> 36:41.457
Well, that's...

36:41.866 --> 36:43.993
He sounds very senior.

36:44.135 --> 36:45.693
I think this is
some senior guy

36:45.870 --> 36:47.428
who has screwed
the pooch, big-time.

36:47.538 --> 36:49.597
Yeah, that's why
we got him, you know.

36:49.707 --> 36:51.868
We caught him with his thing
caught in a big, fat wringer.

36:51.976 --> 36:53.568
Yeah.
And us in the driver's seat.

36:53.678 --> 36:54.702
Uh-huh!

36:54.812 --> 36:58.009
This is our opportunity.
You don't get many of these.

36:58.082 --> 37:01.108
You slip on the ice outside of,
you know, a fancy restaurant,

37:01.252 --> 37:02.981
or something like this happens.
- Right.

37:03.020 --> 37:05.614
And right now
this has happened.

37:05.656 --> 37:07.351
Yup.

37:07.425 --> 37:08.949
It sure has.

37:12.263 --> 37:15.833
This could put a big
dent in my surgeries.

37:15.868 --> 37:16.959
Uh-huh.

37:17.868 --> 37:19.096
Big time.

37:21.906 --> 37:24.033
Honey! Honey!

37:24.909 --> 37:26.001
Huh?

37:26.077 --> 37:29.478
My car is here.
I'm off, mystery man.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.806
What is that thing?

37:31.949 --> 37:33.541
It's top secret, baby.

37:34.051 --> 37:35.313
How many cities?

37:35.386 --> 37:38.651
Seattle, San Francisco,
Los Angeles, Chicago.

37:38.723 --> 37:40.486
Why do they always
send you to Seattle?

37:40.558 --> 37:41.616
It's not a big market.

37:41.692 --> 37:43.660
I don't know. Lots of
independent bookstores.

37:43.728 --> 37:45.855
Rains all the time.
What else are people gonna do?

37:45.930 --> 37:47.090
I can think of
a couple of things.

37:47.164 --> 37:49.155
You can think of one thing.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.291
Where are they
putting you?

37:50.401 --> 37:51.390
Christ, it better
be the Peninsula,

37:51.535 --> 37:53.435
the money I make for them.

37:53.871 --> 37:55.463
Are you gonna be okay?

37:55.573 --> 37:56.904
I'll be sad,
but I'll be okay.

37:56.974 --> 37:58.202
Not too sad.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.607
Just the right amount.

38:02.046 --> 38:04.310
I am crazy about you, baby.

38:26.871 --> 38:27.997
Hey!

38:40.151 --> 38:43.287
Tony Bennett, Toni Morrison,

38:43.322 --> 38:46.956
Zoe Caldwell.
It was marvelous.

38:46.991 --> 38:50.051
First time I've ever
attended the Kennedy Honors.

38:50.127 --> 38:51.754
Jane Alexander
is a client,

38:51.829 --> 38:54.059
an old friend of Zoe's.

38:54.131 --> 38:55.462
Anyway...

38:57.868 --> 38:59.563
Connie.
- Yes, sir.

38:59.670 --> 39:03.071
<i> Would you bring in your
copy of the Cox financials?</i>

39:05.743 --> 39:09.975
<i>Tony sang</i>
The Best is Yet to Come.

39:10.081 --> 39:11.139
<i>Tony Bennett.</i>

39:15.286 --> 39:16.685
I thought I had it
here on a disk.

39:16.754 --> 39:18.085
I don't know
where the disk is.

39:18.155 --> 39:21.386
I'm sorry, I'll have to run
another off my hard drive.

39:21.459 --> 39:22.756
All right. Okay.

39:22.827 --> 39:24.988
So we've drawn up the papers,

39:25.096 --> 39:30.056
and we are prepared to execute service
on Osborne, if you so elect, Mrs. Cox.

39:30.701 --> 39:33.295
But since we are at
the point of no return,

39:33.437 --> 39:36.702
I always urge my clients
in this juncture

39:36.807 --> 39:40.937
to give it one more
day of reflection.

40:12.877 --> 40:14.174
Harry?

40:15.679 --> 40:17.237
It's Linda.

40:18.849 --> 40:20.248
Well, hello.

40:21.218 --> 40:23.982
I did the whole
bodyguard thing for years.

40:24.688 --> 40:26.918
My guy was in State, the
Secretary as a matter of fact,

40:26.991 --> 40:29.221
so I did a lot
of traveling.

40:29.326 --> 40:32.352
"Ironside has left the building."
We called him Iron Ass.

40:32.463 --> 40:33.589
Not to his face,
of course.

40:33.664 --> 40:34.961
Not to his ass, either!

40:36.300 --> 40:37.460
He was okay.

40:37.568 --> 40:38.626
Personal protection's
a young man's game.

40:38.736 --> 40:39.896
These are really good.
You wanna try one?

40:40.037 --> 40:42.665
Yeah? Does that have
shell food in it?

40:43.374 --> 40:45.171
Shell food?
- I got a sensitivity.

40:45.242 --> 40:46.675
I go into
anaphylactic shock.

40:46.744 --> 40:49.679
My larynx swells up and it closes...
What the hell.

40:49.747 --> 40:51.408
Live dangerously, huh?

40:52.183 --> 40:53.878
Can't always wear a condom,
right?

40:54.018 --> 40:55.747
That's right! Not always!

40:58.456 --> 41:00.549
Yeah. My job now is
mostly administrative.

41:00.724 --> 41:02.521
Not so much PP,
personal protection.

41:02.560 --> 41:03.618
I do still
carry the gun.

41:03.661 --> 41:04.889
Oh, my God.

41:04.962 --> 41:07.055
No big deal.
Never discharged it

41:07.198 --> 41:09.325
in 20 years of service.
Security blanket now.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.095
I don't even think about it.
Of course,

41:11.502 --> 41:12.969
you're not supposed
to think about it.

41:13.070 --> 41:15.698
In a situation where your man is
threatened, the training kicks in.

41:15.840 --> 41:18.707
It's muscle memory.
Just like that. It's reflexes. It's...

41:18.776 --> 41:20.710
Those are outrageous.
You wanna swap?

41:20.778 --> 41:22.302
No way!

41:22.379 --> 41:24.108
Go away. Go away.
Let me touch.

41:24.215 --> 41:25.375
Okay. Saki?

41:26.617 --> 41:29.051
There was a hell of a lot
of political infighting

41:29.119 --> 41:31.553
and petty, petty shit,
and then basically

41:31.622 --> 41:33.522
the old man stepped
on Geiberger's throat.

41:33.591 --> 41:36.082
This is nice.
Is this wide-plank pine?

41:36.160 --> 41:37.889
Yeah. I guess so.

41:38.562 --> 41:39.586
Yeah.

41:39.697 --> 41:42.257
Listen, Linda,
full disclosure here.

41:42.366 --> 41:44.857
Yes, I am not wearing a
wedding ring, but I am married.

41:44.969 --> 41:45.993
Hmm.

41:46.103 --> 41:49.504
I took the ring off about 18 months
ago when we agreed to separate,

41:49.607 --> 41:50.972
we agreed to disagree.

41:51.075 --> 41:52.770
That's about the only
thing we ever agreed on.

41:54.144 --> 41:56.772
Well, thanks for telling me, Harry.
I really appreciate it.

41:56.847 --> 41:59.577
You know,
full transparency is my MO.

42:01.919 --> 42:03.443
That's not gonna
go off, is it?

42:03.487 --> 42:06.456
Well, let's get in the
other room and find out.

42:18.135 --> 42:19.864
That's great.
That's exciting.

42:20.037 --> 42:21.766
Yeah. He's very,
very communicative.

42:21.906 --> 42:24.238
Very accessible.
He has a sense of humor,

42:24.308 --> 42:26.276
and he agrees 100%
about my surgeries.

42:26.410 --> 42:27.434
Well...

42:27.578 --> 42:28.636
He agrees my ass
could be smaller.

42:28.746 --> 42:30.270
I mean,
not in a mean way.

42:30.347 --> 42:32.406
It comes from
a place of humor.

42:32.483 --> 42:37.147
That's good, but, Linda, what do
you really know about this guy?

42:37.254 --> 42:39.279
I told you, he's in
the Treasury Department.

42:39.356 --> 42:41.517
But, no, I mean...

42:41.625 --> 42:44.753
You know, he could be one of these
guys that cruises the Internet.

42:44.828 --> 42:46.420
Yeah, so am I.

42:48.299 --> 42:50.290
What's wrong
with this?

42:50.367 --> 42:52.062
No, you cannot
wear that.

42:52.169 --> 42:53.363
You have to
wear a suit.

42:53.470 --> 42:55.631
You mean,
go home and change?

42:55.739 --> 42:57.229
Yeah!

42:58.309 --> 43:00.470
I was gonna
ride my bike.

43:46.557 --> 43:48.252
Osborne Cox.

43:50.995 --> 43:54.487
And you, I take it,
are Mr. Black.

43:54.565 --> 43:56.795
Yes, I am.

43:57.401 --> 43:59.369
You have the money?

44:00.804 --> 44:02.271
$50,000.

44:03.340 --> 44:06.776
That's what was agreed
upon, Osborne Cox.

44:08.479 --> 44:12.040
All right. Let me explain
something to you, Mr. Black.

44:12.650 --> 44:15.141
You know who I am,
I know who you are.

44:15.219 --> 44:16.481
Perhaps,

44:17.154 --> 44:20.920
but appearances
can be deceptive.

44:21.158 --> 44:22.557
Yeah.

44:22.660 --> 44:27.097
What you're engaged in is blackmail.
That is a felony.

44:27.197 --> 44:28.926
That's for starters.

44:29.066 --> 44:30.829
Appearances
can be deceptive.

44:32.036 --> 44:34.664
I am a mere
Good Samaritan who...

44:34.772 --> 44:38.208
Secondly, the
unauthorized dissemination

44:38.275 --> 44:42.678
of classified material
is a federal crime.

44:42.746 --> 44:45.374
If you ever carried out
your proposed threat,

44:45.449 --> 44:51.012
you would experience such a shit
storm of consequences, my friend,

44:51.088 --> 44:54.387
that your empty little head
would be spinning

44:54.458 --> 44:57.916
faster than the wheels of your
Schwinn bicycle back there.

44:58.028 --> 44:59.518
You think
that's a Schwinn.

44:59.596 --> 45:03.623
Now give me the
fucking floppy or the CD

45:03.701 --> 45:05.965
or whatever the fuck it is...

45:06.070 --> 45:09.164
As soon as you give
us the money, dickwad!

45:15.212 --> 45:16.372
You fuck!

45:16.513 --> 45:17.673
Give it to me, fuck!

45:17.748 --> 45:21.445
You fucker.
I know who you are, fucker!

45:21.552 --> 45:23.383
You're the fucker!

45:27.024 --> 45:29.254
Where's the money?
- He hit me!

45:29.359 --> 45:31.020
Where's the money?

45:31.762 --> 45:32.888
He didn't give it to me.

45:32.963 --> 45:35.056
For... Get in the car.
Get in the car.

45:44.475 --> 45:47.740
What are
you doing? Shit!

45:51.648 --> 45:55.812
Fuck it!
Fuck! Fucking lunatic!

45:58.088 --> 45:59.749
You fucking morons!

45:59.823 --> 46:00.847
Dick!

46:02.426 --> 46:04.417
That'll give him something to think about.
- Yeah.

46:04.461 --> 46:05.587
I knew this
would happen.

46:05.629 --> 46:06.687
Wait. Wait!
We gotta go back!

46:06.764 --> 46:07.753
My bike!

46:07.831 --> 46:08.957
It's on to Plan B.

46:09.199 --> 46:12.794
That's just a Kryptonite lock.
You can open those fuckers with a Bic pen!

46:13.237 --> 46:14.704
Some people.

46:20.344 --> 46:21.368
What is this?

46:21.512 --> 46:22.570
Russian Embassy.

46:25.315 --> 46:28.113
I told Mr. Krapotkin
I might be stopping by.

46:29.086 --> 46:30.986
Is there a men's room?

46:39.429 --> 46:41.920
Madam,
you are mistaken.

46:42.566 --> 46:45.091
I am assistant
cultural attaché.

46:46.069 --> 46:48.469
The organs of state security
are not allowed to function

46:48.539 --> 46:50.131
within the borders
of your country.

46:50.941 --> 46:52.602
Organs?

46:53.577 --> 46:54.635
Yes.

46:56.680 --> 47:00.411
But what if I had, say,
secrets of a highly...

47:01.185 --> 47:04.211
Secrets that might interest
the organs of the...

47:06.023 --> 47:07.081
Yes?

47:13.096 --> 47:14.757
That's just a taste.

47:26.677 --> 47:28.304
May I ask the source
of this material?

47:28.378 --> 47:29.402
No, you may not.

47:29.479 --> 47:31.470
He's very high up.
- Chad!

47:31.548 --> 47:33.573
What?
I'm just saying he's high up.

47:38.989 --> 47:41.014
PC or Mac?

47:41.091 --> 47:42.183
PC.
PC.

47:43.827 --> 47:44.987
Could you wait, please?

47:45.062 --> 47:46.256
I do have a date.

47:51.401 --> 47:52.390
Hey!

47:58.075 --> 48:00.635
The fish has bitten.

48:01.044 --> 48:02.204
Huh?

48:02.980 --> 48:04.675
Yeah, he seems cool.

48:07.718 --> 48:08.742
<i>Chad.</i>

48:16.927 --> 48:19.259
Could you accompany me, please?

48:32.376 --> 48:33.707
There is more material?

48:33.777 --> 48:35.142
There's a lot more.

48:35.279 --> 48:37.270
But we want to
be paid first.

48:38.649 --> 48:40.913
You are not ideological?

48:43.220 --> 48:44.778
I don't think so.

48:44.855 --> 48:47.346
Look, I have
a date, so...

48:51.328 --> 48:52.386
Date.

48:55.299 --> 48:56.823
Uh-oh.

48:58.001 --> 49:00.868
A line to check in, towels piling up.
I'm sorry, Ted.

49:01.004 --> 49:03.234
And Manolo running
around like crazy.

49:03.273 --> 49:05.036
What happened to your nose?

49:05.075 --> 49:06.702
This is not acceptable
at Hardbodies.

49:07.311 --> 49:08.505
You two know
better than that.

49:08.578 --> 49:10.205
Yes, we do, Ted.
I'm really sorry.

49:10.280 --> 49:11.372
This is no way...

49:11.448 --> 49:13.848
It was unavoidable, Ted.
It won't happen again.

49:13.917 --> 49:15.043
But you won't tell me
what's going on.

49:15.118 --> 49:16.415
No, we can't.

49:18.355 --> 49:19.720
I know this is
really terrible, Ted,

49:19.790 --> 49:23.191
but I have to go.
I have a date.

49:26.096 --> 49:30.556
You're changing, Linda.
It's very sad.

49:40.777 --> 49:44.178
Which, to my mind, is all the more
reason to lower the boom on Ozzie.

49:44.481 --> 49:45.812
Mmm-hmm.

49:46.850 --> 49:48.613
Is that it? "Mmm-hmm"?

49:50.020 --> 49:52.614
I'm wondering if it's
the right time and...

49:52.689 --> 49:54.122
Well, of course
it's the right time.

49:54.191 --> 49:56.022
Why wouldn't it
be the right time?

49:56.626 --> 49:58.025
Does this threaten you?
- No.

49:58.128 --> 49:59.959
You and me,
we're rock solid.

50:00.163 --> 50:03.428
It's just, I think that's
why we can afford to be big.

50:04.067 --> 50:06.262
We can think about Ozzie and
whether we give him a chance to

50:06.370 --> 50:07.530
get himself together
a little bit,

50:07.637 --> 50:08.763
before you hammer
the hell out of him.

50:08.872 --> 50:11.534
Is that how you see me? Hammering him?
- Of course not...

50:11.641 --> 50:12.972
No, but that was your word.
- Yeah.

50:13.043 --> 50:15.705
I don't hammer.
- No, of course not. Listen,

50:16.079 --> 50:17.478
I'm no friend of the guy,
you know that.

50:17.614 --> 50:19.013
I think he's an
arrogant little geek.

50:20.217 --> 50:22.549
But, you know, we have
all the time in the world,

50:22.652 --> 50:23.983
and he just lost his job.

50:24.054 --> 50:25.954
He didn't lose it.
He quit.

50:26.023 --> 50:29.220
Yeah, well, most of the people
in this town who quit, were fired.

50:29.659 --> 50:31.490
I feel sorry for him,

50:31.862 --> 50:35.923
and I think he'll be a lot easier to
deal with if he doesn't feel cornered.

50:39.703 --> 50:43.332
Maybe. Just as long as we're
talking about Ozzie here, not you.

50:43.440 --> 50:45.067
Of course we're
talking about Ozzie.

50:46.343 --> 50:48.675
I'll do whatever you want, baby.
I adore you.

50:53.183 --> 50:55.117
You get the check.
- Okay.

50:55.185 --> 50:59.588
Yeah. Yes.
Is there blood in his stool?

51:00.624 --> 51:02.091
Later.
I'm running home.

51:05.362 --> 51:06.693
I love you, baby.

51:16.406 --> 51:17.839
Ozzie?

51:20.243 --> 51:23.440
God damn it, Ozzie, what
have you done to the car?

51:26.249 --> 51:29.082
All right. All right.

51:46.636 --> 51:48.160
Oh, my God,
am I really late?

51:48.271 --> 51:51.138
No, no.
It doesn't start for five minutes.

51:52.642 --> 51:54.075
You haven't seen
this yet, have you?

51:54.211 --> 51:55.678
This one, no.
No, I have not.

51:55.745 --> 51:56.734
I hear it's terrific.

51:56.880 --> 51:57.904
Great.

51:58.982 --> 52:01.644
<i>We've been over</i>
<i>and over and over this.</i>

52:01.818 --> 52:04.685
<i>First you say you</i>
<i>can't commit, and then...</i>

52:04.721 --> 52:06.188
<i>Would you come</i>
<i>down from there?</i>

52:14.598 --> 52:18.432
Pardon our dust, the ex is
in the process of moving out.

52:19.035 --> 52:20.969
I told her to
expedite things, but...

52:21.037 --> 52:22.061
Yeah.

52:22.172 --> 52:24.003
Yeah, you know, you try
to act like an adult.

52:24.074 --> 52:25.439
Well,
it's never easy.

52:25.509 --> 52:26.635
Hmm.

52:27.177 --> 52:29.873
You wanna come downstairs?
You like surprises?

52:29.980 --> 52:32.346
Well, I'm always open
to new experiences.

52:32.415 --> 52:35.509
I gotta tell you, I saw an ad for
this in a gentleman's magazine,

52:35.585 --> 52:39.521
1,200 bucks. 1,200 bucks.
I'm looking at this thing and I think,

52:39.589 --> 52:42.319
"Jesus, you gotta be kidding me.
I'm a hobbyist.

52:42.993 --> 52:45.325
"This thing's basically
nothing but Speed-Rail."

52:45.395 --> 52:47.295
I figure I'd go down
to Home Depot

52:47.364 --> 52:49.594
and whip this up myself
for 100 bucks.

52:50.734 --> 52:51.792
What is it?

52:51.902 --> 52:52.926
What is it?

52:54.070 --> 52:57.301
You sit down there,
make yourself comfortable,

52:57.941 --> 53:01.172
put your feet in
the stirrups and...

53:06.316 --> 53:08.181
Oh, my God!

53:13.323 --> 53:14.813
That's fantastic!

53:14.925 --> 53:16.552
Something, isn't it?
100 bucks all in.

53:16.660 --> 53:19.595
Not counting my labor
and the cost of the dildo.

53:19.696 --> 53:21.391
Those things aren't cheap.
- Uh-huh!

53:21.498 --> 53:24.524
See, I lack that.
I'm not set up to mold hard rubber.

53:27.637 --> 53:30.037
The Russians? The Russians?
- Uh-huh.

53:30.106 --> 53:31.403
Mmm-hmm.

53:31.708 --> 53:33.369
The Russian Embassy, yeah.

53:34.177 --> 53:35.201
Are you sure?

53:35.278 --> 53:38.406
Hey, the guy was not hard
to follow, as you know.

53:38.715 --> 53:43.652
Why the fuck would they go to the Russians?
Why the fuck?

53:46.823 --> 53:48.688
I'm sorry.
Thank you, Hal.

53:49.259 --> 53:51.159
Hey. No problemo.

53:54.898 --> 53:56.991
Look, Ozzie, I hate to be
the paranoid old spook,

53:57.100 --> 53:59.967
but those two guys seem
very interested in you.

54:03.473 --> 54:05.805
You haven't gone poofy
on me, have you, Oz?

54:09.312 --> 54:10.779
Can I help you?

54:10.914 --> 54:12.404
I'm sorry
if I was staring,

54:12.482 --> 54:14.143
but your face
looks familiar.

54:14.217 --> 54:16.651
It's Princeton? '73?

54:16.720 --> 54:17.778
Yeah.

54:17.854 --> 54:19.219
I can't remember
your name.

54:19.289 --> 54:20.517
Osborne Cox.

54:20.657 --> 54:21.919
I thought so.

54:21.992 --> 54:24.051
Served and witnessed.

54:24.928 --> 54:26.623
You have a real
nice evening.

54:29.399 --> 54:30.423
Ouch.

54:43.880 --> 54:46.041
What the fuck?

54:52.322 --> 54:55.723
Fuck! What the fuck?

55:08.004 --> 55:09.767
Fuck! Fucking...

55:15.712 --> 55:17.441
Why did you tell him
we could get more stuff?

55:17.514 --> 55:19.106
Well, maybe we can.

55:19.182 --> 55:21.946
That's all Manolo found.
That was everything.

55:22.018 --> 55:24.179
What, are we
gonna tell Manolo

55:24.287 --> 55:26.517
to scoop some more secret
spy shit off the locker floor?

55:26.623 --> 55:27.681
Hey!
- What?

55:27.791 --> 55:30.282
I don't like the snideness,
nor the negativity.

55:30.894 --> 55:33.124
I'm sorry. I'm just
trying to work this thing.

55:33.196 --> 55:35.027
If I'm gonna reinvent myself,
I need these surgeries,

55:35.098 --> 55:36.292
and these surgeries
cost money.

55:36.366 --> 55:38.334
And this is not just
fun and games. I'm sorry.

55:38.435 --> 55:40.198
So let's figure
this thing out, okay?

55:40.337 --> 55:42.362
<i>Chad,</i>
<i>your Berry Blast is ready.</i>

55:42.572 --> 55:44.096
We know who he is.

55:44.274 --> 55:45.798
Right, Osborne Cox.

55:45.909 --> 55:48.434
So we can find out
where he lives, right?

55:48.511 --> 55:49.842
I guess.

55:49.913 --> 55:52.438
You should change into a suit.
- Why?

55:52.549 --> 55:54.210
So you don't stand out
in his neighborhood.

55:54.284 --> 55:55.342
There are certain
elemental things, Chad.

55:55.418 --> 55:56.442
His neighborhood?

55:56.519 --> 55:59.352
Yes. We should take out the
labels and the laundry marks.

55:59.422 --> 56:00.719
Laundry marks?

56:00.924 --> 56:02.289
Deniability.

56:05.495 --> 56:07.122
<i>Shake it down</i>

56:11.101 --> 56:12.728
<i>Shakes right</i>

58:33.810 --> 58:35.243
What's the odometer say?

58:36.212 --> 58:37.270
Five.

58:37.347 --> 58:39.474
About five or approximately five?
I mean...

58:39.616 --> 58:41.743
For fuck's sake, Harry,
it's five miles.

58:42.018 --> 58:43.383
5.2.

58:43.453 --> 58:45.648
Okay. I gotta do
at least five.

58:45.722 --> 58:47.314
Five and a deuce is okay.

58:47.390 --> 58:49.358
I'm amazed you
have the energy.

58:49.425 --> 58:51.723
You kidding? Pull around the
corner and we'll do it in the back.

58:51.828 --> 58:53.557
You're so coarse.

58:53.663 --> 58:55.995
No. Back of the car,
not a rear entry situation.

58:56.065 --> 58:58.499
Fuck! I'm late.

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:14.855
Hello?

01:04:05.575 --> 01:04:08.738
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:04:33.736 --> 01:04:36.864
Oh, my God.
What the fuck?

01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:43.935
What the fuck?

01:04:51.954 --> 01:04:55.287
What the fuck? Nothing?

01:04:56.859 --> 01:04:57.951
Oh!

01:04:58.027 --> 01:05:03.226
Oh, my fuck.
I killed a fucking spook.

01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:08.798
What the fuck are you doing
here, you fucker? You...

01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:30.681
Olson, what's up?

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:45.597
Palmer, what's up?

01:05:45.708 --> 01:05:50.111
Not quite certain,
sir, but it's messy.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.840
Kolyma Two tells us
they have computer files

01:05:53.916 --> 01:05:57.147
from an ex-analyst
of mine, Osborne Cox.

01:05:57.219 --> 01:05:58.345
Kolyma Two?

01:05:58.421 --> 01:05:59.445
Our man in
the Russian Embassy.

01:05:59.522 --> 01:06:00.454
Hmm.

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:03.023
They were brought in
to them by a woman...

01:06:03.092 --> 01:06:04.252
The Russians?

01:06:04.293 --> 01:06:09.458
Yeah. It was brought in by
a woman named Linda Litzke,

01:06:09.699 --> 01:06:11.667
an associate of a guy
named Harry Pfarrer.

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:13.792
Picture's in the file,
with Pfarrer's.

01:06:13.903 --> 01:06:15.336
The Russians?
- Yeah.

01:06:17.907 --> 01:06:19.272
And who's Pfarrer?

01:06:20.543 --> 01:06:25.776
Treasury guy who has
been screwing Mrs. Cox.

01:06:25.881 --> 01:06:27.542
That must be how
they got the files.

01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:30.015
Or maybe Ozzie
knows about them.

01:06:30.086 --> 01:06:31.713
They all seem to be
sleeping with each other.

01:06:31.787 --> 01:06:32.879
All right. Spare me.

01:06:32.955 --> 01:06:35.549
Yes, sir,
but this Treasury guy,

01:06:36.792 --> 01:06:40.523
it's become complicated.

01:06:42.865 --> 01:06:46.767
He just shot somebody
in Ozzie's house.

01:06:47.903 --> 01:06:50.098
Shot your analyst?

01:06:50.206 --> 01:06:51.901
No, Ozzie wasn't there.

01:06:52.108 --> 01:06:55.202
Our man surveilling
hears a gunshot,

01:06:55.277 --> 01:06:57.074
sees the guy
wrestle something

01:06:57.146 --> 01:06:59.580
into his car. Follows him.

01:06:59.648 --> 01:07:02.048
He dumps a body in
the Chesapeake Bay.

01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:04.412
Well, what'd he do that for?

01:07:04.453 --> 01:07:05.545
Don't know, sir.

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:07.055
For Christ sake, did
anyone fish the body out?

01:07:07.123 --> 01:07:08.181
Mmm-hmm.

01:07:08.257 --> 01:07:09.622
And Russian? American?

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:11.353
Don't know.
Scrubbed of ID.

01:07:13.362 --> 01:07:14.659
And this Linda...

01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:16.197
Linda Litzke.

01:07:16.265 --> 01:07:17.664
Yeah, she's Treasury?

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:19.158
No.

01:07:19.268 --> 01:07:23.102
We're fuzzy on her.

01:07:24.774 --> 01:07:27.743
So we don't really know
what anyone is after.

01:07:28.244 --> 01:07:29.438
Not really, sir.

01:07:30.413 --> 01:07:33.382
And this analyst,
ex-analyst...

01:07:33.449 --> 01:07:35.007
Cox.

01:07:35.084 --> 01:07:37.644
Yeah. What's his
clearance level?

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.449
Three.

01:07:39.922 --> 01:07:41.753
Okay, no biggie.

01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:45.791
Just, for now, just keep an eye
on everyone, see what they do.

01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:50.525
Yes, sir. And we'll interface
with the FBI on this dead body.

01:07:50.633 --> 01:07:53.796
No! No. God, no. We don't want
those idiots bumbling around in this.

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:55.666
Burn the body.
Get rid of it.

01:07:55.771 --> 01:07:59.537
And keep an eye on
everyone, see what they do.

01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:02.709
Report back to me when...

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:07.248
I don't know,
when it makes sense.

01:08:10.986 --> 01:08:12.010
<i>Go!</i>

01:08:12.421 --> 01:08:15.322
<i>And tap. Up, up and tap!</i>

01:08:15.424 --> 01:08:16.550
<i>Up, up and tap.</i>

01:08:16.692 --> 01:08:17.852
I'm bigger.
I'm bigger.

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.587
<i>Now let's add the arms,</i>
<i>right here.</i>

01:08:19.728 --> 01:08:21.354
I'm bigger than ever.

01:08:21.464 --> 01:08:23.295
<i>Up, up, again.</i>
<i>And again.</i>

01:08:23.432 --> 01:08:25.296
I'm bigger. I'm back.
I'm better. I'm back.

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:27.301
Than ever. I'm back.
<i>- Let's do it again. Come on.</i>

01:08:27.368 --> 01:08:28.393
You fuckers, I'm back.

01:08:28.504 --> 01:08:29.562
<i>Up, up, down, down.</i>

01:08:29.671 --> 01:08:30.729
You fuckers, I'm back.

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:31.863
<i>Up, up, down, down, up!</i>

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:34.033
<i>And last time...</i>

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:45.777
Linda. You okay?

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:47.979
Yeah, I'm fine, Ted. I'm sorry.

01:08:48.491 --> 01:08:49.582
You don't look fine.

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:50.750
No, no, I'm...

01:08:52.094 --> 01:08:53.925
But you won't
tell me what's wrong.

01:08:54.763 --> 01:08:56.594
You never let me in, Linda.

01:08:56.665 --> 01:08:58.997
I know you're trustworthy.
I just...

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:01.501
I don't want to endanger other people.
I mean...

01:09:01.636 --> 01:09:04.970
This is the path that I've chosen.
It's not...

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:08.407
You have to isolate,
you know, a firewall.

01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:12.874
Well, I don't know
what to think.

01:09:12.948 --> 01:09:14.415
You both go AWOL on Friday.

01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:16.383
And today Chad doesn't even
bother to come in at all.

01:09:16.484 --> 01:09:18.510
I know, Ted.
I can't run a gym this way.

01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:20.350
I know, Ted.
I'm going to have to fire him.

01:09:20.421 --> 01:09:21.752
No, no, no.
Ted, just...

01:09:21.857 --> 01:09:23.221
What?

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:24.758
Give me 24 hours!

01:09:25.493 --> 01:09:28.529
To what?
- I don't know. Just give me 24 hours!

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:31.260
Linda...
- Just give me 24 hours to solve this thing.

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:36.104
Linda, I have to tell you.

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:38.662
A man was in here earlier,
asking about you.

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:41.072
Are you in some
kind of trouble?

01:09:41.143 --> 01:09:42.804
Is Chad running away
from something?

01:09:42.877 --> 01:09:45.210
We know what we're doing, Ted.
- Let me ask you this,

01:09:45.281 --> 01:09:47.305
did he know my name?

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:49.308
Well, yes, he was asking about you.

01:09:49.385 --> 01:09:51.546
Employment history,
etcetera. Real jerk.

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:52.814
I told him to get lost.

01:09:52.921 --> 01:09:54.149
Thank you, Ted.

01:09:56.659 --> 01:10:00.459
Well, we just don't give
that out at Hardbodies.

01:10:00.596 --> 01:10:02.291
<i>Linda, a Mr. Krapotkin on line two.</i>

01:10:02.398 --> 01:10:03.422
Oh, my God.

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:08.261
Mr. Krapotkin?

01:10:08.437 --> 01:10:09.495
<i>This Linda?</i>

01:10:09.638 --> 01:10:10.627
Yes?

01:10:10.773 --> 01:10:14.470
<i>Yes, this is Ilan Krapotkin, in the
Russian Embassy, returning your call.</i>

01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:17.512
Yes, yes! Hang on.
I'm sorry, Ted. This is private.

01:10:24.787 --> 01:10:28.120
Mr. Krapotkin? Is this a secure line?
<i>- Yes?</i>

01:10:29.992 --> 01:10:31.687
Mr. Krapotkin?
Is this a secure...

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:32.784
<i>Are you joking?</i>

01:10:32.861 --> 01:10:37.821
No! I'm very worried about
my associate, you know, Chad.

01:10:39.168 --> 01:10:40.567
Do you have him?
<i>- Do we have him?</i>

01:10:42.004 --> 01:10:43.904
Is he... Was he...
Well, I don't know what the term is.

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:45.099
Did he go over?

01:10:45.207 --> 01:10:49.007
<i>I don't understand.</i>
<i>Is he not at Hardbodies?</i>

01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:55.179
No. Look, could I come
in and discuss this?

01:10:57.219 --> 01:10:59.187
<i>I'm very busy</i>
<i>at the moment.</i>

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:00.313
I'm coming anyway.

01:11:17.006 --> 01:11:18.997
You seem distracted.

01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:22.137
Do I?

01:11:22.211 --> 01:11:24.406
Very distracted.
The last few days.

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:28.310
Work.

01:11:30.185 --> 01:11:32.016
You think that might
be enough carrots?

01:11:35.024 --> 01:11:36.150
What?

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:37.418
For the salad.

01:11:42.097 --> 01:11:44.793
You know, you really
are a negative person.

01:11:46.335 --> 01:11:47.324
What?

01:11:47.436 --> 01:11:49.199
I've tried to ignore it,

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:51.034
to remain upbeat.

01:11:51.106 --> 01:11:53.370
Harry,
stop the foolishness.

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:55.740
Stop the foolishness?
- Yes, and behave.

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:59.440
You are not speaking to one
of your "shithole buddies."

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:55.796
<i>Hello?</i>

01:12:56.305 --> 01:12:59.240
Honey, it's so good
to hear your voice.

01:12:59.308 --> 01:13:00.400
<i>Is something wrong,</i>
<i>Harry?</i>

01:13:00.542 --> 01:13:06.481
No. Yeah. Can you come
home? Baby needs you.

01:13:06.949 --> 01:13:08.246
Can you please come home?

01:13:08.317 --> 01:13:11.844
<i>Harry, you know I can't
just leave the book tour.</i>

01:13:12.254 --> 01:13:13.915
I can show you your present.
It's finished.

01:13:13.989 --> 01:13:17.584
<i>Harry, I can't just leave.</i>
<i>There are two days left.</i>

01:13:17.693 --> 01:13:19.490
<i>There's still Seattle.</i>

01:13:21.663 --> 01:13:23.062
Yeah.

01:13:23.198 --> 01:13:24.631
<i>I love you, Harry.</i>

01:13:25.501 --> 01:13:28.959
Yeah. I love you, too.

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:38.376
Hey! Fucker!

01:13:43.485 --> 01:13:44.509
Fucker!

01:13:46.555 --> 01:13:47.886
Fucker!

01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:55.854
Fucker!

01:13:55.998 --> 01:13:58.228
Who do you
work for?

01:13:58.300 --> 01:13:59.995
Who do you work for?

01:14:04.807 --> 01:14:07.241
Who are you?
Who are you?

01:14:07.376 --> 01:14:09.810
Who do you work for?
CIA? NSC?

01:14:09.878 --> 01:14:11.812
Tuchman Marsh!
- What?

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:13.245
Tuchman Marsh.
- Tuchman Marsh?

01:14:13.348 --> 01:14:14.372
Yes.

01:14:14.483 --> 01:14:15.507
Your name is Tuchman Marsh?

01:14:15.584 --> 01:14:17.848
Tuchman Marsh
Hauptman Rodino!

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.649
I work for them!
You work for Tuchman Marsh.

01:14:19.721 --> 01:14:20.847
Yes!

01:14:21.623 --> 01:14:22.715
Is that a law firm?

01:14:22.825 --> 01:14:25.123
No, a rock band.
Yes, it's a law firm.

01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:26.923
Well, why are you
following me?

01:14:26.995 --> 01:14:28.724
Divorce action,
numb nuts!

01:14:32.267 --> 01:14:33.256
My wife hired you?

01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:36.303
No. Your wife hired Tuchman Marsh.
Tuchman Marsh hired me.

01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:38.373
I work for Tuchman Marsh.

01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:51.316
Sandy.

01:14:51.887 --> 01:14:54.720
Jesus. Grow up, man.
It happens to everybody.

01:15:00.128 --> 01:15:02.596
"And at midnight
of the third day,

01:15:02.664 --> 01:15:06.156
"even the sergeant
at arms fell asleep.

01:15:07.703 --> 01:15:14.165
"And it was just then, at that very moment,
that Oliver sneezed."

01:15:14.543 --> 01:15:15.874
Can we just...
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

01:15:15.944 --> 01:15:18.378
You have to let the folks at
home see this illustration.

01:15:18.447 --> 01:15:19.846
Can we just get
a shot of that?

01:15:19.982 --> 01:15:21.415
There, there it is.

01:15:21.483 --> 01:15:23.747
It's Oliver interrupting
the filibuster with...

01:15:24.987 --> 01:15:26.887
That's wonderful.
It's wonderful.

01:15:26.955 --> 01:15:29.150
The book is <i>Point</i>
<i>of Order Oliver!</i>

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:32.591
And the talented author
is Sandra Pfarrer.

01:15:32.661 --> 01:15:34.253
She'll stay with us
for our next segment

01:15:34.329 --> 01:15:36.229
when we meet
the Sultan of Salad.

01:15:36.298 --> 01:15:39.927
And then it's part two of our very
special interview with Dermot Mulroney.

01:15:40.035 --> 01:15:41.502
So keep it where it is.

01:15:43.705 --> 01:15:46.606
That was way out of line.
We were so unbelievably clear with them,

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:48.107
"It's just an Oliver segment."
- That's fine.

01:15:48.176 --> 01:15:49.165
Del and Connie
are such putzes.

01:15:49.278 --> 01:15:50.267
That's fine.
Thank you, we're done.

01:15:50.345 --> 01:15:51.778
Well, okay, great.

01:15:52.047 --> 01:15:54.345
I thought that
would never end.

01:15:55.784 --> 01:15:57.251
Me, too.

01:16:00.289 --> 01:16:02.553
Let me get
this crap off my face.

01:16:23.211 --> 01:16:25.270
What the fuck?

01:16:33.488 --> 01:16:35.820
Yes, madam.
Can we help you?

01:16:36.058 --> 01:16:38.618
What kind of Mickey Mouse
embassy are you running, anyway?

01:16:38.694 --> 01:16:40.389
I've been waiting
for 45 minutes!

01:16:40.495 --> 01:16:42.326
I'm so sorry, ma'am.
An urgent matter.

01:16:42.397 --> 01:16:44.365
Well, maybe this
is an urgent matter,

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:47.493
since, you know, Chad's
been missing for 48 hours.

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:51.238
I do not know the whereabouts
of Mr. Chad, madam.

01:16:51.273 --> 01:16:54.436
He was gathering information
for you when he was taken.

01:16:55.544 --> 01:16:59.810
We're not interested in such
information. It was dribble.

01:17:01.216 --> 01:17:03.207
Dribble?

01:17:03.585 --> 01:17:05.382
Would you like your
disk back, madam?

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:06.444
Dribble?

01:17:07.389 --> 01:17:09.755
I will give you dribble.
You listen to me, Mr. Krapotkin.

01:17:09.825 --> 01:17:11.019
I am a US citizen,

01:17:11.093 --> 01:17:13.254
and I will not take
this kind of treatment.

01:17:18.867 --> 01:17:23.327
My check was returned
for insufficient funds.

01:17:23.705 --> 01:17:25.605
No. No, no, ma'am. No.

01:17:25.674 --> 01:17:28.472
There're over $40,000
in that account.

01:17:28.543 --> 01:17:30.477
The account
is not overdrawn.

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:33.304
When?

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:37.551
But how could she
have access with...

01:17:38.387 --> 01:17:40.446
What about our savings...

01:17:40.522 --> 01:17:43.150
What about my
savings account?

01:17:43.225 --> 01:17:44.590
Mmm-hmm.

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:50.064
No. No, I'm sorry. I don't know
the number to my savings account,

01:17:50.132 --> 01:17:53.397
because believe it or not,
I don't spend my entire day

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:56.733
sitting around trying to
memorize the fucking numbers

01:17:56.838 --> 01:18:00.069
to my fucking bank
accounts! Moron!

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:17.415
No way. No, no way. Whoa!
No way, Linda. No.

01:18:17.492 --> 01:18:18.823
Well, I can't do it, Ted.

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.291
I don't know anything
about computers.

01:18:20.395 --> 01:18:21.692
Linda, this whole
thing is crazy.

01:18:21.763 --> 01:18:24.095
It was crazy the first time,
and you want to do it again?

01:18:24.166 --> 01:18:27.226
Break into the man's house?

01:18:27.335 --> 01:18:29.530
You said the Russians
didn't even want this stuff.

01:18:29.638 --> 01:18:31.105
My world is bigger
than that, Ted.

01:18:31.206 --> 01:18:32.332
There are other people.

01:18:32.507 --> 01:18:33.701
There are the Chinese.

01:18:33.809 --> 01:18:34.833
Linda,
these surgeries...

01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:36.102
No. It's not about
the surgeries, Ted!

01:18:36.178 --> 01:18:38.646
We can use this as
leverage to get Chad back.

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:39.769
What do you mean
get him back?

01:18:39.848 --> 01:18:41.440
Information is power, Ted.
Hello!

01:18:41.516 --> 01:18:42.642
What do you mean
get him back?

01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:43.776
You don't know where he is?

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:47.547
Somebody has him, Ted.
We can use this to...

01:18:47.656 --> 01:18:49.817
You call the police if you
wanna get back missing people.

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:51.358
I can't take it! I can't take it!
I can't take it!

01:18:51.426 --> 01:18:52.620
You know I can't do that.

01:18:52.694 --> 01:18:54.457
We're operating off
the map here, Ted.

01:18:54.529 --> 01:18:56.497
This is higher than the police.
It is higher than them.

01:18:56.565 --> 01:18:58.624
Linda, I...
- I need a can-do person, Ted!

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.930
I hate your negativity!
I hate your reasons why not!

01:19:01.103 --> 01:19:03.571
I hate you! I hate you!

01:19:14.282 --> 01:19:16.147
What will it be?

01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:18.985
Seven and Seven.

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:26.723
Hello?
<i>- It's Harry.</i>

01:19:27.562 --> 01:19:30.895
You think a marriage is...
And then it's...

01:19:35.003 --> 01:19:37.563
But this has all been
a long time coming.

01:19:39.207 --> 01:19:42.870
Was it? Well, yeah, right.

01:19:43.111 --> 01:19:44.942
I'm just depressed.

01:19:47.883 --> 01:19:50.283
I gotta exercise.
I haven't run in three days.

01:19:50.352 --> 01:19:52.217
Butt crunches,
anything.

01:19:53.922 --> 01:19:55.321
You think maybe I could
stay here for a little while?

01:19:55.423 --> 01:19:56.981
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no, no.

01:19:57.058 --> 01:19:59.185
It can't always
come from me.

01:19:59.261 --> 01:20:00.956
I'm not that strong!

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:03.530
You are not here
for me, Harry.

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:07.628
I need a can-do person!
You're all defeated!

01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:09.432
Chad is the only
can-do person I know,

01:20:09.538 --> 01:20:11.563
and now he's gone. He's gone.
I'm sorry, baby.

01:20:11.673 --> 01:20:13.504
I'll be good.
I'll be better.

01:20:14.109 --> 01:20:15.542
I just gotta exercise.

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:18.306
Do you have a pedestrian path or something?
- Who the fuck is Chad?

01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:19.847
He's my friend from work.

01:20:19.981 --> 01:20:21.448
You can help me find him.

01:20:21.516 --> 01:20:22.574
You know law
enforcement people.

01:20:22.717 --> 01:20:23.775
You could make a call.

01:20:23.852 --> 01:20:25.114
Unofficially.
- Linda, hold on.

01:20:25.187 --> 01:20:26.279
What happened?
What's his name?

01:20:26.354 --> 01:20:27.378
Chad Feldheimer.

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:30.617
And he just disappeared. He hasn't
been at work or at home for two days!

01:20:30.692 --> 01:20:32.319
Okay. You know his
Social Security number?

01:20:32.394 --> 01:20:34.624
No! I...
- Okay.

01:20:34.696 --> 01:20:35.788
Where was the last
place you saw him?

01:20:35.864 --> 01:20:37.593
No, I don't know.
He just disappeared.

01:20:37.732 --> 01:20:39.461
The Jamba Juice on K Street.

01:20:39.568 --> 01:20:41.297
And now he's gone.

01:20:41.469 --> 01:20:43.232
No. Okay.
Now, okay, okay.

01:20:43.371 --> 01:20:46.602
We're gonna find your little
buddy. It's a piece of cake.

01:20:46.708 --> 01:20:47.732
Okay.

01:20:47.876 --> 01:20:51.403
Piece of cake. Very easy. Okay.

01:20:52.914 --> 01:20:56.748
Open your mouth, open it. Do as the
doctor says. Come on, open your mouth.

01:20:56.852 --> 01:20:59.787
Come on. Open your mouth.
Now look here, young man.

01:20:59.888 --> 01:21:03.187
You do as I say, or I'm gonna ask
your mother to leave the doctor's room,

01:21:03.358 --> 01:21:05.792
and you and I are gonna
sort it out between us.

01:21:10.565 --> 01:21:15.002
Hello?
I'm with a patient.

01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:19.029
And it's the same fucking patient
she's been with since yesterday?

01:21:19.174 --> 01:21:22.007
You tell Dr. Cox
I have the new keys.

01:21:39.628 --> 01:21:41.255
Hey, there, sunshine.

01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:43.757
You seem better.

01:21:43.865 --> 01:21:46.060
Yeah, well, I snuck in a
little gym time this morning.

01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:47.691
And our exercise
last night didn't hurt.

01:21:47.869 --> 01:21:49.427
Why, Harry.

01:21:49.571 --> 01:21:52.597
Boy, I tell you. I'm through
banging my head against the wall.

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:54.231
I'm gonna start doing
what's right for me.

01:21:54.342 --> 01:21:56.469
I believe that, also. I think you
have to do what's right for you.

01:21:56.578 --> 01:21:58.409
Yeah. Hell, yeah. You know,
I had a shock recently,

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:01.711
and I realized that life is not
infinite and that no one is immortal.

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:04.080
I think that it's very important
to maintain a positive attitude.

01:22:04.152 --> 01:22:05.517
Always up,
always ebullient.

01:22:05.553 --> 01:22:07.145
Don't sweat
the small stuff.

01:22:07.188 --> 01:22:09.122
And it's all small stuff.
And it's all small stuff.

01:22:27.976 --> 01:22:31.002
Just for starters.

01:22:32.847 --> 01:22:34.314
Boy.

01:22:35.583 --> 01:22:38.609
Why, this is where we
first met, you remember?

01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:40.484
Of course I do.

01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:44.653
And it's hard to know what the
important days are until you...

01:22:46.761 --> 01:22:48.854
Now, I told myself that I
wasn't going to be paranoid,

01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:50.955
but is that guy
looking at us?

01:22:53.902 --> 01:22:55.028
No. Uh-uh.

01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:57.529
Have you found out
anything about Chad?

01:22:57.639 --> 01:22:58.628
No, nothing yet.

01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:00.708
I put in a couple of calls.
It shouldn't take too long.

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:01.864
Really?

01:23:02.577 --> 01:23:05.478
Yeah. There are so many
databases now it's a joke.

01:23:05.513 --> 01:23:08.004
Back when I was in PP,
there was still an art

01:23:08.049 --> 01:23:09.607
to finding people.
But not anymore.

01:23:09.684 --> 01:23:13.450
Now with cell phones? I mean,
pretty soon everybody's gonna know

01:23:13.521 --> 01:23:15.489
where you are at any given
moment, any given moment.

01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:16.852
Mmm-hmm.

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:18.683
All right.

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:20.991
When you left Jamba Juice,

01:23:21.062 --> 01:23:23.826
did Chad give you any idea
where he might be going?

01:23:23.898 --> 01:23:26.162
I know where he was going.
- You do?

01:23:26.267 --> 01:23:31.671
Georgetown. Olive Street.
160 Olive Street.

01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:35.476
It's the residence of this guy,
Osborne Cox.

01:23:44.019 --> 01:23:45.418
Who are you?

01:23:48.556 --> 01:23:49.580
What?

01:23:50.592 --> 01:23:54.756
Who are you?
You CIA? NSA? You're military?

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:59.758
Who do you work for?
Who do you work for?

01:24:01.336 --> 01:24:02.803
Who are you?

01:24:04.172 --> 01:24:08.131
I'm just Linda Litzke.

01:24:24.192 --> 01:24:25.454
Harry!

01:26:12.433 --> 01:26:14.196
For Pete's sake.

01:26:47.101 --> 01:26:52.740
And you are my wife's lover?

01:26:52.775 --> 01:26:53.729
No.

01:26:53.841 --> 01:26:54.865
Then what are
you doing here?

01:26:57.579 --> 01:27:01.242
I know you.
You're the guy from the gym.

01:27:02.684 --> 01:27:04.481
I'm not here
representing Hardbodies.

01:27:04.586 --> 01:27:08.078
Yes. I know very well
what you represent.

01:27:08.523 --> 01:27:11.219
You represent
the idiocy of today.

01:27:13.528 --> 01:27:15.018
I don't represent
that, either.

01:27:15.096 --> 01:27:16.757
Yeah.
You're the guy at the gym

01:27:16.831 --> 01:27:18.890
when I asked about
that moronic woman.

01:27:18.967 --> 01:27:21.265
She's not a moron.

01:27:21.436 --> 01:27:23.768
You're in league
with that moronic woman.

01:27:23.905 --> 01:27:26.237
You're part of
a league of morons.

01:27:26.307 --> 01:27:27.797
No. No.

01:27:27.909 --> 01:27:30.639
Yes. You see,
you're one of the morons

01:27:30.712 --> 01:27:33.340
I've been fighting
my whole life,

01:27:33.514 --> 01:27:37.507
my whole fucking life.
But guess what.

01:27:39.587 --> 01:27:41.452
Today, I win.

01:27:51.532 --> 01:27:52.624
Stop!

01:27:54.235 --> 01:27:55.634
Intruder!

01:27:56.337 --> 01:27:59.864
Stop! Intruder! Stop!

01:28:04.078 --> 01:28:06.012
Wait. Wait a minute.

01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:11.745
Where is the Treasury guy?
- Pfarrer?

01:28:11.819 --> 01:28:13.684
Right now?
- Right now.

01:28:14.422 --> 01:28:16.822
He is in a detention room
at Washington Dulles.

01:28:16.924 --> 01:28:17.948
Why?

01:28:18.092 --> 01:28:20.652
He was trying to board
a flight to Venezuela.

01:28:20.828 --> 01:28:24.286
We had his name on a hot list.
CBP pulled him in.

01:28:26.034 --> 01:28:29.170
Don't know why he was
trying to go to Venezuela.

01:28:29.205 --> 01:28:30.296
You don't know.

01:28:30.405 --> 01:28:31.531
No, sir.

01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:34.667
We have no extradition
with Venezuela.

01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:36.402
Oh!

01:28:37.478 --> 01:28:39.070
So what should
we do with him?

01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:41.205
For fuck's sake, put him on
the next flight to Venezuela.

01:28:41.316 --> 01:28:43.147
Yes, sir. Okay.

01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:47.216
Okay. So the gym manager is dead.
- Yes, sir.

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:48.346
The body is...

01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:49.788
That's gone, sir.

01:28:51.492 --> 01:28:52.516
Okay.

01:28:53.194 --> 01:28:56.857
But there was a snag.

01:28:57.732 --> 01:28:59.029
What?

01:28:59.467 --> 01:29:00.729
Well,

01:29:01.369 --> 01:29:06.329
this analyst, Cox,
was attacking the gym guy.

01:29:06.708 --> 01:29:08.699
It was in broad daylight,
on the street.

01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:11.176
Our man did not
know what to do.

01:29:11.245 --> 01:29:12.473
Felt he had to step in.

01:29:13.114 --> 01:29:14.342
Yes?

01:29:14.982 --> 01:29:16.313
He...

01:29:18.219 --> 01:29:21.586
He shot the analyst.
He shot Cox.

01:29:23.658 --> 01:29:26.559
Good. Great.
Is he dead?

01:29:26.627 --> 01:29:28.720
No, sir. He's in a coma.

01:29:29.764 --> 01:29:32.324
They don't think he's gonna
make it. They don't think...

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:36.029
They're pretty sure that
he has no brain function.

01:29:37.271 --> 01:29:42.208
Okay. Okay. If he wakes up, we'll worry
about it then. Jesus, what a clusterfuck.

01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:44.608
So, that's it then?

01:29:44.712 --> 01:29:47.647
No one else really
knows anything. Okay.

01:29:47.749 --> 01:29:48.943
Um...

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:51.644
Well, sir, there is...

01:29:51.719 --> 01:29:53.277
What?

01:29:54.122 --> 01:29:55.555
What?

01:29:55.623 --> 01:29:58.251
There is the woman,
the gym woman,

01:29:58.326 --> 01:29:59.588
Linda Litzke.

01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:02.652
Oh! Fuck, yeah.
God! Where is she?

01:30:02.797 --> 01:30:04.765
We picked her up.
We have her.

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:07.095
We have her?
To do what with?

01:30:07.201 --> 01:30:13.663
She says she'll play ball
if we pay for some,

01:30:13.808 --> 01:30:17.244
I know this sounds odd,
some surgeries

01:30:17.345 --> 01:30:20.439
that she wants,
cosmetic surgery.

01:30:20.982 --> 01:30:23.382
She says she'll sit
on everything.

01:30:23.951 --> 01:30:25.145
How much?

01:30:25.219 --> 01:30:26.618
There were
several procedures.

01:30:26.687 --> 01:30:27.813
Altogether they...
- Pay it.

01:30:27.889 --> 01:30:30.084
Yes, sir. Okay. Yeah.

01:30:33.394 --> 01:30:34.759
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:30:34.829 --> 01:30:36.319
Yeah.

01:30:37.865 --> 01:30:39.696
What do we learn, Palmer?

01:30:39.767 --> 01:30:41.132
I don't know, sir.

01:30:42.069 --> 01:30:43.764
I don't fucking know, either.

01:30:45.206 --> 01:30:47.401
I guess we learn not to do it again.
- Yes, sir.

01:30:47.475 --> 01:30:49.602
I'm fucked if
I know what we did.

01:30:49.744 --> 01:30:51.905
Yes, sir,
it's hard to say.

01:30:53.481 --> 01:30:55.881
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:34:06.617 --> 01:34:07.620
