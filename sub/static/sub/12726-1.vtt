02:01.866 --> 02:03.476
Yeah.
Feel nice and tired.

02:03.523 --> 02:06.226
But, I don't think
I've ever felt this way before.

02:06.757 --> 02:08.577
Yeah.
Move over.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.273
Oh!

02:10.477 --> 02:12.435
Hello, Mr. Humpty

02:14.833 --> 02:16.138
Oh.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.351
Mom...

02:27.643 --> 02:29.202
Sorry.

02:29.823 --> 02:31.359
Where should we get to?

02:31.726 --> 02:34.101
- See "the looking-glass".
- Hhh.

02:36.811 --> 02:40.576
I'll tell all my ideas about
the little looking-glass house.

02:41.180 --> 02:42.836
What is a looking-glass?

02:42.922 --> 02:45.413
It's a mirror.
Like that one.

02:49.016 --> 02:50.805
Mom...

02:52.587 --> 02:55.494
I'm sorry.
Right.

02:56.291 --> 02:58.806
First, there's a room
you can see through the glass.

02:58.877 --> 03:01.970
There is a room through the glass.
I've seen it.

03:02.002 --> 03:03.080
Look at you?

03:03.182 --> 03:05.221
I expect it is probably
like this room, isn't it?

03:05.260 --> 03:06.533
Just the other way around.

03:06.580 --> 03:09.088
No, different.
Completely different.

03:09.143 --> 03:10.213
You look.

03:10.393 --> 03:11.948
Go over there and
look through there?

03:12.003 --> 03:13.713
- Let's look on your face...
- Please...

03:13.791 --> 03:15.979
Oh, you're such mean bully.

03:16.066 --> 03:17.863
- Go on.
- All right.

03:24.548 --> 03:26.092
Can you see it?

03:26.361 --> 03:28.359
I see you...

03:28.461 --> 03:30.008
and me.

03:30.833 --> 03:33.547
I rather not see me at the moment.

03:33.641 --> 03:36.493
What's about the room?
The one with the glass?

03:36.851 --> 03:40.196
No, just this one.
And all of your things.

03:40.562 --> 03:42.664
You're not looking hard enough.

03:42.750 --> 03:46.212
You got to believe it
before you can see it.

04:01.246 --> 04:04.059
First, there's room
you can see through the glass.

04:04.286 --> 04:08.075
That's the same as our drawing one.
And all the things go the other way.

04:13.487 --> 04:16.401
I know that because I held up
one of our books to the glass,

04:16.447 --> 04:19.065
and then they hold one up
in the other room.

04:20.858 --> 04:23.970
How nice it would be if any we could
get into the looking-glass house?

04:24.059 --> 04:26.157
Go on, try.

04:31.052 --> 04:32.840
<i>Go on, try.</i>

04:54.562 --> 04:58.080
They didn't keep this room
nearly as tidy as they should.

05:05.971 --> 05:09.739
Here are the White Queen and
the White King walking arm in arm.

05:10.351 --> 05:12.413
I don't think they can hear me.

05:12.593 --> 05:15.015
And I'm nearly sure they can't see me.

05:15.384 --> 05:18.538
I feel somehow as if
I would get invisible.

05:19.910 --> 05:22.785
Aaaah!
It's the voice of my child.

05:22.856 --> 05:27.146
My precious Lily.
My imperial little kitten.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.528
I'm coming.

05:33.591 --> 05:34.700
Ah.

05:37.013 --> 05:38.013
Ah.

05:38.192 --> 05:39.442
Ohhh!

05:44.916 --> 05:47.623
Mind the volcano!

05:47.694 --> 05:49.007
What volcano?

05:49.091 --> 05:51.248
It blew me up here.

05:51.311 --> 05:53.483
You come up the regular way.

05:53.537 --> 05:56.115
Don't get blown up!

06:00.340 --> 06:03.739
You'll be hours and hours
getting to the table at that rate.

06:03.977 --> 06:05.735
I'd better help you, hadn't I?

06:05.837 --> 06:07.692
Uh-ah.
Oh oh!

06:08.184 --> 06:10.235
Oh,  please, don't make such faces.

06:10.322 --> 06:13.282
Make me laugh so much,
I can hardly hold you.

06:16.881 --> 06:18.166
Water.

06:19.070 --> 06:20.477
I assure you, my dear.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.845
I turned cold to the very end
of my whiskers.

06:22.890 --> 06:26.132
- Huh, call those whiskers?
- Oh the horror of that moment,

06:26.203 --> 06:28.320
I shall never, never forget it.

06:28.406 --> 06:32.178
You will forget it if you don't
write it down in the memorandum.

06:38.729 --> 06:39.909
Ah.

06:45.615 --> 06:47.402
"The Jabberwocky."

06:47.787 --> 06:51.056
"Twas brillig, and slithy toves,"

06:51.081 --> 06:54.239
"Did gyre and gimble in the wabe."

06:55.305 --> 06:57.688
It's rather hard to understand.

06:58.595 --> 07:01.704
Seem to fill my head with ideas.

07:02.235 --> 07:04.774
Only I don't exactly know
what they are?

07:04.986 --> 07:07.705
If I don't make haste, I shall have
to go back through the looking-glass,

07:07.744 --> 07:10.327
before I've seen what the rest
of the house is like.

07:10.641 --> 07:12.095
Have a look at the garden first.

07:12.149 --> 07:13.993
My dear, I really must
get the thinner pencil.

07:14.064 --> 07:15.360
I can't manage this one a bit.

07:15.400 --> 07:18.158
It writes all manner
of things I don't intend.

07:18.354 --> 07:20.212
What sort of things?

07:21.295 --> 07:26.041
'The White Knight slid down the poker.
He balanced very badly."

07:26.244 --> 07:28.709
That's not a memorandum of your feelings.

07:28.756 --> 07:30.044
Uh, oh.

07:55.321 --> 07:59.477
I should see the garden far better
if I could get to the top of that hill.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.789
And here is the path
that leads straight to it.

08:26.278 --> 08:27.900
O Tiger-lily,

08:27.994 --> 08:30.013
I wish you could talk.

08:34.312 --> 08:35.484
We can.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.578
When there's anybody worth talking to.

08:37.610 --> 08:38.696
Exactly.

08:38.741 --> 08:41.506
- Ooh, ogle her.
- Ooh, ogle her.

08:42.047 --> 08:44.469
How is it you all talk so nicely?

08:44.641 --> 08:47.617
I've been in many gardens,
but, none of the flowers could talk.

08:47.718 --> 08:51.477
Put your hand on the ground.
Then you'll know why.

08:52.188 --> 08:54.712
In most gardens,
they make the beds too soft.

08:54.767 --> 08:56.816
So, the flowers are always asleep.

08:56.918 --> 08:58.410
I've never thought of that before.

08:58.465 --> 09:00.653
It's my opinion that
you never think at all.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.619
- Absolutely.
- Ooh.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.770
Are there any other people
in the garden besides me?

09:05.833 --> 09:09.254
There's one of the flowers in the garden
that can move about like you.

09:09.309 --> 09:12.655
But, she's more bushy than you are.

09:12.702 --> 09:14.108
So, she's not like me?

09:14.186 --> 09:16.367
Well, she has the same
awkward shape as you,

09:16.398 --> 09:19.148
but, she is redder and
her petals are shorter.

09:19.263 --> 09:22.639
Yes, not tumble about, naturally.

09:22.686 --> 09:25.093
But, that's not your fault.

09:27.910 --> 09:29.765
You're beginning to fade,
you know?

09:29.843 --> 09:31.546
- Hhh!!!
- You are.

09:31.632 --> 09:35.905
And then one can't help
one's petals getting a little untidy.

09:59.230 --> 10:01.088
Where do you come from?
Where are you going?

10:01.135 --> 10:02.768
Look up.
Speak nicely.

10:02.831 --> 10:05.605
And don't twiddle
your fingers all the time.

10:09.045 --> 10:10.106
I've lost my way.

10:10.131 --> 10:13.271
I don't know what you mean by "your way"?
All the ways about here are mine.

10:13.351 --> 10:15.460
But, why did you come out here at all?

10:15.515 --> 10:18.835
Curtsey while you try to think what to say.
It saves time.

10:18.929 --> 10:21.773
It's time for you to answer now.

10:21.812 --> 10:24.069
Open your mouth a little wider
when you speak.

10:24.117 --> 10:27.187
And always say: Your Majesty.

10:27.680 --> 10:30.610
I only wanted to see
what the garden was like.

10:31.376 --> 10:34.672
- Your Majesty.
- That's right.

10:34.750 --> 10:35.938
Now, when you say "garden",

10:35.977 --> 10:41.368
I've seen gardens, compare with which
this would be a wilderness.

10:41.704 --> 10:44.063
And then I thought I'd try
to get to the top of that hill.

10:44.110 --> 10:45.535
When you say "hill",

10:45.598 --> 10:50.575
I could show you hills, in comparison
with which you'd call that a "valley".

10:50.957 --> 10:52.332
No, I shouldn't.

10:52.419 --> 10:56.278
A hill can't be a valley, you know?
That would be nonsense.

11:03.690 --> 11:06.298
You may call it "nonsense" if you like.

11:06.384 --> 11:08.205
But, I've heard nonsense,

11:08.253 --> 11:12.088
compare with which that would be
as sensible as a dictionary!

11:17.832 --> 11:20.884
It's marked out just like
a large chessboard.

11:22.115 --> 11:26.662
It's a great huge game of chess
that is being played all over the world.

11:26.985 --> 11:30.014
O how I wish
I was one of the players.

11:31.337 --> 11:34.142
That's easily managed.

11:34.818 --> 11:39.435
You can be the White Queen's pawn
since Lily's too young to play.

11:55.862 --> 11:59.903
Now, you're in the second square
to begin with.

12:00.174 --> 12:04.017
When you get to the eighth square,
you'll be a Queen.

12:04.244 --> 12:05.628
Queen?

12:06.460 --> 12:08.628
- Are you thirsty?
- Terribly.

12:08.674 --> 12:10.221
Have a biscuit.

12:12.404 --> 12:17.779
While you're refreshing yourself,
I'll just take the measurements.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.542
After two yards,...

12:22.498 --> 12:25.057
I should give you directions.

12:26.289 --> 12:28.643
- Have another biscuit.
- No, thank you.

12:28.737 --> 12:30.792
Thirst quelched, I hope?

12:30.983 --> 12:33.311
After three yards,

12:33.389 --> 12:36.623
I should repeat the directions
for fearing you'd forgotten them.

12:36.709 --> 12:40.053
After four yards,
I should say goodbye.

12:40.124 --> 12:43.015
And after five yards,
I should go.

12:43.360 --> 12:44.571
Now,...

12:44.953 --> 12:49.943
the pawn goes two squares
in its first move.

12:49.968 --> 12:56.031
So, you'll go very quickly through
the third square, by train, I should think.

12:56.125 --> 13:00.023
And find yourself in
the fourth square in no time.

13:00.053 --> 13:02.461
And that belongs to
Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

13:02.500 --> 13:05.180
The fifth square is mostly water.

13:05.258 --> 13:08.659
The sixth square belongs to Humpty Dumpty.

13:09.667 --> 13:11.957
But, you make no remark.

13:12.883 --> 13:14.792
I didn't know I had to make one,
just then.

13:14.839 --> 13:16.136
You should have said:

13:16.207 --> 13:19.520
It's extremely nice of you
to tell me all this.

13:19.555 --> 13:22.774
However, we'll suppose it said.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.932
The seventh square is forest.

13:24.972 --> 13:27.620
However, one of the knights
will show you the way.

13:27.690 --> 13:32.417
And in the eighth square,
we'll be Queens together.

13:32.456 --> 13:35.794
And it's all feasting and fun.

13:35.989 --> 13:40.388
Speak in French when you can't
think of the English for a thing.

13:40.531 --> 13:42.758
Turn your toes out when you walk.

13:42.821 --> 13:46.875
And remember...
who you are.

13:49.867 --> 13:51.251
Goodbye.

14:13.706 --> 14:15.261
Tickets, please!

14:22.582 --> 14:25.191
Where's your ticket, child?

14:25.222 --> 14:26.699
Don't  keep him waiting, child.

14:26.724 --> 14:29.856
Why, his time is worth
a thousand pounds a minute.

14:30.466 --> 14:32.715
I'm afraid I don't have one.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.762
There wasn't a ticket-office
where I came from.

14:35.801 --> 14:37.955
There wasn't room for one
where she came from.

14:38.002 --> 14:40.431
The land there is worth
a thousand pounds an inch.

14:40.478 --> 14:42.064
Don't make excuses.

14:42.112 --> 14:44.479
You should have bought one
from the engine-driver.

14:44.525 --> 14:45.963
The man that drives the engine.

14:46.010 --> 14:49.175
Why, the smoke alone is worth
a thousand pounds a puff.

14:49.206 --> 14:51.479
- I don't know what to say.
- Better say nothing at all.

14:51.518 --> 14:54.143
Language is worth
a thousand pounds a word.

14:54.168 --> 14:56.612
I'll dream about a thousand pounds,
tonight, I know I shall.

14:56.651 --> 14:59.831
You are traveling the wrong way.

15:00.153 --> 15:01.247
Sorry, but...

15:01.302 --> 15:04.357
so young a child ought to know
which way she's going.

15:04.548 --> 15:06.778
Even if she doesn't know
her own name.

15:06.918 --> 15:08.825
She ought to know her way
to the ticket-office,

15:08.896 --> 15:10.623
even if she doen't know her alphabet.

15:10.676 --> 15:13.684
She'll have to go back,
from here as luggage.

15:13.825 --> 15:16.097
Lovely.
Like a parcel.

15:16.122 --> 15:17.637
Change engines.

15:17.692 --> 15:19.404
It sounds like a horse.

15:19.624 --> 15:21.116
You might make a joke on that.

15:21.187 --> 15:23.405
Something about horse and hoarse,
you know?

15:23.452 --> 15:26.140
She can go by post.
She's got a head like a stamp.

15:26.179 --> 15:29.674
You could be sent as a message
by telegraph.

15:29.710 --> 15:34.206
She must draw the train herself
for the rest of the way.

15:34.418 --> 15:36.523
Never mind what he says.

15:36.813 --> 15:39.820
Get a return ticket
every time the train stops.

15:39.882 --> 15:40.884
Indeed, I shan't.

15:40.916 --> 15:43.947
I don't belong to
this railway journey at all.

15:44.263 --> 15:47.235
I was in the woods just now.
I wish I was back there.

15:47.298 --> 15:48.603
You might make a joke on that.

15:48.651 --> 15:51.486
Something like,
you would if you could, you know?

15:51.563 --> 15:54.884
If you're so anxious to have a joke made,
why don't you make it yourself.

15:54.916 --> 15:58.095
I know you are a friend,
a dear friend and an old friend.

15:58.134 --> 16:00.938
And you won't hurt me.
Though I am an insect.

16:00.986 --> 16:02.252
What kind of insect?

16:02.315 --> 16:05.155
What? Then you don't know
that I'm a gnat?

16:05.324 --> 16:06.330
It's only a brook.

16:06.355 --> 16:08.769
We have to jump over
to the fourth square.

16:08.816 --> 16:12.277
Fourth square?
Fourth square!

16:12.827 --> 16:16.504
Fourth square.
Who tends fourth square?

16:17.867 --> 16:20.845
You don't like all insects?

16:21.213 --> 16:23.104
I like ones that can talk.

16:23.310 --> 16:25.603
None of them talk where I come from.

16:26.642 --> 16:30.126
What kind of insects
do you rejoice in?

16:30.485 --> 16:33.556
I... I don't rejoice in insects at all.

16:33.642 --> 16:35.845
Because I'm rather afraid of them.

16:36.492 --> 16:38.511
At least, the large ones.

16:38.814 --> 16:41.330
But, I could tell you
the names of some of them.

16:41.456 --> 16:44.113
And of course,
they answer to their names?

16:44.371 --> 16:45.793
I never knew them do it.

16:45.837 --> 16:48.831
What's the use to having names
if they don't answer to them?

16:49.028 --> 16:50.697
Hmm.
No use to them.

16:50.736 --> 16:53.431
But, useful to the people
that name them, I suppose.

16:53.596 --> 16:56.675
If not, why do things have names at all?

16:56.917 --> 16:57.940
I can't say.

16:58.018 --> 17:01.167
Furthermore, in the woods over there,
they have no names.

17:01.238 --> 17:03.831
Howver, go on with your list.
You're wasting time.

17:03.886 --> 17:06.854
Oh, um...
well, there's the horse-fly.

17:06.987 --> 17:10.291
Halfway up that bush,
you'll see a rocking-horse-fly,

17:10.323 --> 17:11.823
made entirely of wood,

17:11.863 --> 17:14.902
and it gets about by swinging itself
from branch to branch.

17:15.038 --> 17:16.573
What does it live on?

17:16.675 --> 17:19.192
Sap and sawdust.

17:21.087 --> 17:22.665
Go on with your list.

17:22.775 --> 17:26.531
Um, then there's the dragonfly.

17:26.556 --> 17:29.657
Look on the branch above your head,
you'll see a snap-dragonfly.

17:29.712 --> 17:32.478
Its body is a cornish pasty.

17:32.572 --> 17:34.268
Its wings are holly leaves.

17:34.314 --> 17:37.885
And its head is a small raisin,
burning in brandy.

17:37.963 --> 17:39.377
And what does it live on?

17:39.440 --> 17:41.018
Frumenty and mince pie.

17:41.073 --> 17:43.924
And it makes its nest in a Christmas box.

17:44.042 --> 17:46.315
And then there's the butterfly.

17:46.705 --> 17:48.072
- Crawling at your feet,
- Hmm.

17:48.135 --> 17:50.033
you'll observe a bread-and-butterfly.

17:50.080 --> 17:52.526
Its wings are thin slice
of the bread-and-butter.

17:52.573 --> 17:55.940
Its body is a crust,
and its head is a lump of sugar.

17:56.254 --> 17:58.221
And what does it live on?

17:58.315 --> 18:01.237
Weak tea with cream in it.

18:01.713 --> 18:03.549
But, suppose it couldn't find any?

18:03.620 --> 18:05.846
Well, then it would die, of course.

18:06.183 --> 18:07.980
That must happen very often?

18:08.051 --> 18:10.301
But, it always happens.

18:15.541 --> 18:18.150
I suppose you wouldn't want
to lose your name?

18:18.236 --> 18:19.259
No, indeed.

18:19.314 --> 18:21.345
And yet, I don't know.
I mean,...

18:21.596 --> 18:25.082
imagine how convenient it would be
if you manage to go home without it.

18:25.107 --> 18:28.607
For instance, if the governess wanted
to call you to your lessons,

18:28.678 --> 18:31.006
she would shout out: Come here.

18:31.370 --> 18:34.220
And there she had to stop for
there would be no name for her to call.

18:34.245 --> 18:37.027
And of cause, you wouldn't have to go.

18:37.887 --> 18:39.840
Oh, that would never do, I'm sure.

18:39.887 --> 18:42.794
A governess wouldn't
excuse me lessons for that.

18:42.977 --> 18:46.095
Well, if she said 'Miss' and
then said nothing else,

18:46.158 --> 18:50.181
and of course,
you'd miss your lessons.

18:50.673 --> 18:52.548
That was a joke.

18:52.814 --> 18:54.814
I wish you had made it.

18:55.197 --> 18:58.650
Why do you wish I had made it?
It was very bad one.

18:59.963 --> 19:03.243
You shouldn't make jokes
if it makes you so unhappy.

19:03.798 --> 19:05.290
Mmm.

19:22.964 --> 19:26.315
This must the wood
where things have no names.

19:26.503 --> 19:29.854
I wonder what'll become
of my name when I go in?

19:37.834 --> 19:40.540
Beware of the Jabberwock, my son.

19:40.676 --> 19:42.585
Jaws that bite.

20:08.513 --> 20:11.537
[The House of Tweedledum]
[To The House of Tweedledee]

20:13.528 --> 20:16.887
I do believe that they live
in the same house.

20:50.054 --> 20:53.790
I suppose they got the tweedle
on the back of the collar.

20:53.947 --> 20:56.166
If you think we're wax-works,
you ought  to pay.

20:56.213 --> 20:59.345
Wax-works weren't made
to look at for nothing, all right?

20:59.861 --> 21:02.526
If you think we're alive,
you ought to speak.

21:02.596 --> 21:04.604
Sure, I'm very sorry.

21:05.361 --> 21:07.986
Tweedledum and Tweedledee
Agree to have a battle.

21:08.026 --> 21:10.917
For Tweedledum said Tweedledee
Had spoiled his nice new rattle.

21:10.977 --> 21:13.829
I know what you're thinking,
but it ain't so, all right.

21:13.886 --> 21:16.259
Yeah? Because if it was so,
it might be.

21:16.306 --> 21:17.759
And if it was so,
it would be.

21:17.806 --> 21:19.509
But as it isn't, it ain't.

21:19.742 --> 21:21.282
That's logic.

21:22.688 --> 21:23.930
I was thinking,

21:24.009 --> 21:26.486
which is the best way out
of these woods?

21:27.368 --> 21:29.563
It's getting so dark.

21:30.102 --> 21:32.430
Would you please tell me, please?

21:34.516 --> 21:36.024
- First boy.
- Eh eh.

21:36.101 --> 21:38.071
- Next boy.
- I'm sorry.

21:38.524 --> 21:39.938
See, you've begun wrong.

21:39.985 --> 21:41.796
The first thing you do in the visit,
you say:

21:41.836 --> 21:44.000
- How d'ye do?
- And shake hands.

21:56.289 --> 21:59.077
Twas is really enough
for one dance.

21:59.174 --> 22:01.354
It would never do to say
"How do you do?" now.

22:01.417 --> 22:03.831
We seem to have got
beyond that, somehow.

22:04.552 --> 22:06.503
I hope you're not much tired.

22:06.581 --> 22:08.354
No, all right.
But, uh...

22:08.558 --> 22:10.152
thank you very much for asking.

22:10.472 --> 22:12.323
So much obliged.

22:12.478 --> 22:14.143
So, you like poetry?

22:14.550 --> 22:16.072
Yes.

22:16.354 --> 22:17.729
Pretty well.

22:17.885 --> 22:19.713
Some poetry.

22:19.933 --> 22:21.558
Would you tell me
a way out of the wood?

22:21.589 --> 22:23.441
What shall I recite to her?

22:23.729 --> 22:25.627
"The Walrus and the Carpenter"
is the longest.

22:25.702 --> 22:26.862
How long is it?

22:26.908 --> 22:29.418
Tell you what?
We'll do "The Walrus and the Carpenter".

22:29.465 --> 22:30.503
Greet her.

22:30.533 --> 22:32.666
If it is very long,
could you tell me first?

22:32.744 --> 22:36.122
The sun was shining on the sea,
Shining with all his might:

22:36.159 --> 22:38.424
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright.

22:38.463 --> 22:41.229
And this was odd,
Because it was the middle of the night.

22:42.041 --> 22:43.752
The moon was shining sulkily,

22:43.815 --> 22:46.503
Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there

22:46.550 --> 22:48.096
After the day was done.

22:48.299 --> 22:51.222
"It's very rude of him," she said,
"To come and spoil the fun!"

22:51.362 --> 22:54.503
The sea was wet as wet could be,
The sands were dry as dry.

22:54.542 --> 22:57.308
You could not see a cloud,
Because no cloud was in the sky:

22:57.487 --> 23:01.886
No birds were flying overhead.
There were no birds to fly.

23:02.394 --> 23:05.410
The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand;

23:05.450 --> 23:08.863
They wept like anything to see
Such quantities of sand:

23:09.116 --> 23:12.488
"If this were only cleared away,"
They said, "it would be grand!"

23:13.176 --> 23:17.551
"If seven maids with seven mops
Swept it for half a year.

23:17.645 --> 23:19.283
- Do you suppose,"
- The Walrus said,

23:19.323 --> 23:21.378
"That they could get it clear?"

23:21.662 --> 23:25.702
"I doubt it," said the Carpenter,
And shed a bitter tear.

23:29.450 --> 23:33.998
"O Oysters, come and walk with us!"
The Walrus did beseech.

23:34.061 --> 23:38.522
"A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
Along the briny beach:

23:38.767 --> 23:42.539
We cannot do with more than four,
To give a hand to each."

23:42.682 --> 23:46.190
The eldest Oyster looked at him,
But never a word he said:

23:46.229 --> 23:49.925
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
And shook his heavy head

23:49.956 --> 23:52.784
Meaning to say he did not choose
To leave the oyster-bed.

23:52.890 --> 23:56.509
But four young Oysters hurried up,
All eager for the treat:

23:56.603 --> 23:58.783
Their coats were brushed,
their faces washed,

23:58.823 --> 24:00.612
Their shoes were clean and neat.

24:00.728 --> 24:03.861
And this was odd, because, you know,
They hadn't any feet.

24:03.945 --> 24:06.313
Four other Oysters followed them,
And yet another four;

24:06.368 --> 24:09.930
And thick and fast they came at last,
And more, and more, and more

24:10.320 --> 24:14.938
All hopping through the frothy waves,
And scrambling to the shore.

24:15.594 --> 24:18.688
The Walrus and the Carpenter
Walked on a mile or so,

24:18.781 --> 24:22.328
And then they rested on a rock
Conveniently low:

24:22.477 --> 24:25.922
And all the little Oysters stood
And waited in a row.

24:26.071 --> 24:28.895
- "The time has come,"
- The Walrus said,

24:28.927 --> 24:31.365
"To talk of many things:

24:31.492 --> 24:34.469
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax
Of cabbages and kings

24:34.524 --> 24:38.946
And why the sea is boiling hot
And whether pigs have wings."

24:39.000 --> 24:40.915
- "But wait a bit,"
- The Oysters cried,

24:40.962 --> 24:42.439
"Before we have our chat;

24:42.477 --> 24:45.493
For some of us are out of breath,
And all of us are fat!"

24:45.571 --> 24:47.235
- "No hurry!"
- Said the Carpenter.

24:47.337 --> 24:49.392
They thanked him much for that.

24:49.517 --> 24:51.369
- "A loaf of bread,"
- The Walrus said,

24:51.424 --> 24:52.565
"Is what we chiefly need:

24:52.619 --> 24:56.956
Vinegar and Pepper besides
Are very good indeed

24:57.150 --> 24:59.877
Now if you're ready, Oysters dear,

25:00.580 --> 25:02.128
We can begin to feed."

25:02.213 --> 25:05.697
"But not on us!" the Oysters cried,
Turning a little blue.

25:05.783 --> 25:09.307
"After such kindness, that would be
A dismal thing to do!"

25:09.807 --> 25:11.682
- "It seems a shame,"
- The Walrus said,

25:11.707 --> 25:12.799
"To play them such a trick,

25:12.839 --> 25:16.167
After we've brought them out so far,
And made them trot so quick!"

25:16.208 --> 25:18.700
The Carpenter said nothing but

25:18.923 --> 25:21.070
"The butter's spread too thick!"

25:21.240 --> 25:23.286
- "I weep for you,"
- The Walrus said:

25:23.342 --> 25:24.889
"I deeply sympathize."

25:24.931 --> 25:28.330
With sobs and tears he sorted out
Those of the largest size,

25:28.421 --> 25:32.080
Holding his pocket-handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes.

25:32.158 --> 25:34.057
- "O Oysters,"
- Said the Carpenter,

25:34.111 --> 25:37.062
"You've had a pleasant run!
Shall we be trotting home again?'

25:37.094 --> 25:39.515
But answer came there none

25:40.353 --> 25:42.511
And this was scarcely odd, because

25:42.596 --> 25:45.674
They'd eaten every one.

25:48.698 --> 25:50.175
I like the Walrus best,

25:50.214 --> 25:53.057
because he was little sorry
for the poor oysters.

25:53.128 --> 25:55.175
He ate more than the Carpenter, though.

25:55.238 --> 25:56.738
You see?

25:56.995 --> 25:58.902
He hield his handkerchief in front,

25:58.941 --> 26:01.996
so that the Carpenter couldn't count
how many he took.

26:02.066 --> 26:03.464
Know what I'm saying?

26:03.542 --> 26:05.145
That was mean.

26:05.395 --> 26:09.309
Well then, I like the Carpenter best
if he didn't eat so many as the Walrus.

26:09.345 --> 26:11.533
But, he took as many
as he could get.

26:11.643 --> 26:14.800
Well then, they were both
very unpleasant characters.

26:18.805 --> 26:20.946
Are there any lions
or tigers about here?

26:21.055 --> 26:24.602
No, it's only the Red King, snoring.

26:25.323 --> 26:27.375
Come and have a look.

26:40.487 --> 26:42.135
What a lovely sight!

26:42.291 --> 26:44.010
Fit to snore his head off.

26:44.176 --> 26:47.635
I'm afraid he'll catch cold
with lying on the damp straw.

26:47.877 --> 26:49.495
He's dreaming now.

26:49.565 --> 26:51.838
What do you think
he's dreaming about?

26:52.135 --> 26:54.198
Nobody can guess that.

26:54.323 --> 26:56.018
Why, about you.

26:56.268 --> 27:00.718
If he left off dreaming about you,
where do you suppose you'd be?

27:00.976 --> 27:02.835
Where I am now, of course.

27:02.898 --> 27:05.913
Nah. God bless you.
Nah. Not you.

27:06.038 --> 27:07.773
You'd be nowhere.

27:07.859 --> 27:11.055
Why, you're only a sort of thing
in his dream.

27:11.195 --> 27:14.633
If that a King was to wake up there,
you'd disappear.

27:14.782 --> 27:16.970
Poof.
Just like that.

27:17.329 --> 27:18.446
Like that.

27:18.548 --> 27:20.220
No, not like that.

27:20.298 --> 27:21.314
Like that.

27:21.393 --> 27:23.104
Like that.

27:23.571 --> 27:25.602
If I'm just a sort of thing
in his dream,

27:25.665 --> 27:27.556
what does that make you,
I shall like to know?

27:27.595 --> 27:28.656
Ditto.

27:28.681 --> 27:30.477
A ditto.
Ditto!

27:30.587 --> 27:33.688
Harsh. You'll be waking him
if you make so much noise!

27:33.860 --> 27:36.837
Why, there's no use
you two talking about waking him

27:36.869 --> 27:39.674
when you're only one
of the things in his dream.

27:39.814 --> 27:41.525
You know very well
you're not real.

27:41.627 --> 27:43.143
I am real.

27:43.244 --> 27:45.229
I am real.

27:49.992 --> 27:52.485
You won't make yourself
a bit realer by crying.

27:52.525 --> 27:54.719
There's nothing to cry about.

27:57.787 --> 28:00.783
If I wasn't real,
I wouldn't be able to cry.

28:02.190 --> 28:05.752
I don't suppose you have
there are real tears?

28:07.269 --> 28:09.494
Well, at any rate,
I better be getting out of this wood.

28:09.519 --> 28:11.792
For really it's coming on very dark.

28:12.965 --> 28:15.034
You think it's going to rain?

28:15.433 --> 28:17.003
No, I don't think so.

28:17.230 --> 28:18.660
At least, it's not under here now.

28:18.723 --> 28:20.746
But, it may rain outside?

28:20.874 --> 28:22.059
Well, it may.

28:22.161 --> 28:24.192
If it chooses.
We have no objection.

28:24.207 --> 28:25.934
- Don't we?
- No.

28:26.223 --> 28:28.113
Selfish things.

28:28.145 --> 28:29.574
Oh?

28:30.230 --> 28:32.551
See that?
You see that?

28:32.614 --> 28:34.661
- You see it?
- It's only a rattle.

28:35.020 --> 28:37.059
Not a rattlesnake.

28:37.207 --> 28:39.309
Used rattle.
Quite old and broken.

28:39.411 --> 28:42.340
Shouldn't ruin it or spoiled it.

28:43.238 --> 28:46.026
You needn't to get so angry
about an old rattle.

28:46.242 --> 28:49.617
It's not an old rattle.
It's a new one.

28:49.720 --> 28:51.845
I only bought it yesterday!

28:51.907 --> 28:54.298
It's my nice new rattle.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.970
Of course, you agree to have a battle?

28:57.166 --> 28:58.986
I suppose so.

28:59.275 --> 29:02.259
Only she must help us
to get dress up though.

29:22.082 --> 29:25.409
I hope you're good at
pinning and tying things.

29:25.481 --> 29:27.740
Everyone of these has to go on somehow.

29:27.826 --> 29:29.349
Yeah.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.026
You know?

29:35.136 --> 29:38.322
It's one of most serious things
that can possibly happen in a battle,

29:38.456 --> 29:41.347
get one's head cut off.

29:41.558 --> 29:44.003
- Do I look pale?
- Oh, yes, a little.

29:44.050 --> 29:46.621
Yeah, I'm generally very brave.
But today, I have a bit headache.

29:46.715 --> 29:48.778
I... I've got a bit of toothache.

29:48.941 --> 29:50.840
I am far worse than you.

29:50.950 --> 29:52.903
Well then, perhaps,
you'd better not fight today.

29:52.979 --> 29:55.629
- Gone.
- Well, we'll get a bit of battle.

29:55.700 --> 29:58.349
But, I don't care for an hour
or long one. What's the time now?

29:58.410 --> 29:59.598
Half past four.

29:59.661 --> 30:01.997
Well, we'll fight till six
then have dinner, yeah?

30:02.051 --> 30:04.676
Yeah, well, yeah.
And she can watch us, so.

30:04.751 --> 30:06.868
Only you, you'd better
not come very close.

30:06.899 --> 30:09.282
I mean I generally hit
everything I can see.

30:09.321 --> 30:11.063
When I get really excited.

30:11.126 --> 30:13.751
Yeah, and I hit everything within reach,
whether I can see or not.

30:13.799 --> 30:16.354
Well then, you must hit
the trees very often.

30:16.923 --> 30:20.299
I don't suppose there'll be any tree
eft standing by the time we've finished.

30:20.902 --> 30:21.924
All the best.

30:21.949 --> 30:25.939
Just then flew down a monstrous crow,
As black as a tar-barrel;

30:25.993 --> 30:31.107
Which frightened both the heroes so,
They quite forgot their quarrel.

30:31.783 --> 30:33.306
Sounds like a crow.

30:33.510 --> 30:35.470
Slowly.
Just a step back or so.

30:35.548 --> 30:37.251
Don't run.
Don't run!

30:37.293 --> 30:38.892
Run!

30:53.647 --> 30:55.444
Crow can never get at me here.

30:55.734 --> 30:58.061
It's far too large to squeeze itself in.

31:24.499 --> 31:25.929
Oh!

31:27.101 --> 31:28.132
Oh!

31:28.210 --> 31:30.648
Oh, I'm, I'm very glad
I happened to be in the way.

31:30.772 --> 31:32.898
Bread and butter.
Bread and butter.

31:33.047 --> 31:34.828
Bread and butter!

31:35.000 --> 31:36.868
Am I addressing the White Queen?

31:36.923 --> 31:40.923
Well, yes, if you call that a-dressing?
It isn't my notion of the thing at all.

31:41.134 --> 31:43.970
Well, if Your Majesty will only
tell me the right way to begin, then

31:44.017 --> 31:45.204
I'll do it as well as I can.

31:45.238 --> 31:47.251
But, I don't want it done at all.

31:47.283 --> 31:50.908
I've been a-dressing myself
for the past two hours.

31:51.024 --> 31:54.227
- May I help you put your shawl straight?
- I don't know what's mater with it.

31:54.285 --> 31:57.106
It's out of temper, I hink.
I pin it here,

31:57.184 --> 31:59.661
and I pin it there,
but there's no pleasing it.

31:59.715 --> 32:04.223
Well, it, it can't go straight, you know,
if you, you pin it all on one side.

32:04.661 --> 32:05.974
There.

32:06.044 --> 32:08.286
Oh, dear me.
What a state your hair is in?

32:08.318 --> 32:10.896
The hair brush has got entangled in it.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.747
And I lost the comb yesterday.

32:13.998 --> 32:16.357
What you need is a lady's maid.

32:16.803 --> 32:17.944
Well,...

32:17.997 --> 32:20.216
I'll take you with pleasure.

32:20.295 --> 32:23.443
Twopence a week,
and jam every other day.

32:23.529 --> 32:25.662
No, I don't mean you should hire me.

32:25.702 --> 32:27.022
And I don't care for jam.

32:27.061 --> 32:29.718
It's very good jam.

32:30.272 --> 32:32.788
Well, I don't want any today,
at any rate.

32:32.992 --> 32:35.460
Well, you couldn't have it
even if you did want it.

32:35.687 --> 32:41.875
The rule is, jam tomorrow and
jam yesterday, but never jam today.

32:42.484 --> 32:43.586
But,...

32:43.633 --> 32:46.067
it, it must come sometimes to jam today.

32:46.124 --> 32:51.335
Oh, no, it can't.
It's jam every other day.

32:51.476 --> 32:54.460
I don't understand you.
It's dreadfully confusing.

32:54.515 --> 32:59.202
That's the effect of living backwards.
It makes one a little giddy to begin with.

32:59.257 --> 33:01.281
Living backwards?
I've never hread of such thing.

33:01.306 --> 33:05.961
But, there is one great advantage.
In that, one's memory works both ways.

33:06.017 --> 33:08.252
Well, I'm sure,
mine only works one way.

33:08.291 --> 33:10.314
I can't remember things
before they happen.

33:10.361 --> 33:15.377
It's a poor sort of memory
that only works... ha ha... backwards.

33:18.767 --> 33:20.634
What sort of things
do you remember best?

33:20.689 --> 33:24.470
Oh, things that happen
the week after next.

33:24.642 --> 33:27.290
For instance,
there's the King's messenger.

33:27.338 --> 33:29.268
He is in prison,
being punished.

33:29.315 --> 33:32.026
And the trial doesn't even begin
till next Wednesday; and of course,

33:32.065 --> 33:34.548
the crime comes last of all.

33:34.604 --> 33:36.614
Suppose he never commits the crime?

33:36.667 --> 33:39.237
Well, that would be
all the better, wouldn't it?

33:40.389 --> 33:42.146
Well, of course,
it would be all the better.

33:42.171 --> 33:44.358
But, it wouldn't be all the better
his being punished.

33:44.389 --> 33:46.075
You're wrong there, at any rate.

33:46.132 --> 33:47.358
Were you never punished?

33:47.389 --> 33:48.413
Only for fault.

33:48.452 --> 33:50.202
And you were all the better for it, I know.

33:50.233 --> 33:52.530
Oh, yes. But then, I'd done
the things I was punished for.

33:52.555 --> 33:53.687
That makes all the difference.

33:53.726 --> 33:57.858
But, if you hadn't done them,
that would have been better still.

33:58.050 --> 33:59.324
Better.

33:59.673 --> 34:00.892
Better.

34:00.954 --> 34:08.157
Better. Better. Better.
Better. Better. Bet...ter!

34:08.219 --> 34:11.149
Oh, oh! My finger's bleeding.
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

34:11.210 --> 34:12.585
What's matter?
You've pricked it?

34:12.618 --> 34:14.141
I haven't yet.
But, I soon shall.

34:14.188 --> 34:15.462
Well, when do expect to do it?

34:15.501 --> 34:19.205
When I fasten my shawl again,
the brooch would come undone directly.

34:19.251 --> 34:22.385
But, be careful.
You're holding it all crooked.

34:25.379 --> 34:27.989
That accounts for the bleeding.

34:28.328 --> 34:31.579
Now, you understand
how we do things here?

34:31.752 --> 34:34.129
Well, aren't you going to scream again?

34:34.349 --> 34:35.661
Why?

34:36.103 --> 34:37.908
I've done all the screaming already.

34:37.940 --> 34:41.096
What would be the good
of having it all over again?

34:41.313 --> 34:43.150
Well, I'm glad.

34:43.799 --> 34:46.306
I wish I could've managed to be glad.

34:46.377 --> 34:48.260
But, I can never remember the rules.

34:48.306 --> 34:53.370
You must be happy, living here
and being glad whenever you like?

34:53.428 --> 34:56.112
Yes.
Only it's so very lonely here.

34:57.699 --> 34:59.410
Oh...

34:59.472 --> 35:02.308
Don't go on like that.

35:02.529 --> 35:05.696
Consider what a great girl you are.

35:05.845 --> 35:09.760
Consider what a long way
you've come today.

35:10.029 --> 35:12.022
Consider what o'clock it is.

35:12.272 --> 35:16.873
Consider anything.
Only, don't cry.

35:16.944 --> 35:19.194
Can you keep from crying
by considering things?

35:19.249 --> 35:20.545
That's the way it's done.

35:20.600 --> 35:23.397
No-one can do two things at once,
you know?

35:23.475 --> 35:26.764
Now, let's consider
your age to begin with.

35:26.858 --> 35:28.280
How old are you?

35:28.326 --> 35:30.014
I'm seven and a half, exactly.

35:30.061 --> 35:32.764
You don't have to say "exactly".
I can believe it without that.

35:32.889 --> 35:34.842
Now, I'll give you something to believe.

35:34.929 --> 35:36.358
I'm just...

35:36.437 --> 35:40.421
one hundred and one,
five months and a day.

35:40.569 --> 35:42.624
Oh, I can't believe that.

35:42.820 --> 35:44.406
Can't you?

35:44.476 --> 35:46.578
Try again.

35:47.499 --> 35:50.678
Draw long breath, and shut your eyes.

35:50.819 --> 35:54.303
There is no use trying.
One can't believe impossible things.

35:54.343 --> 35:56.054
I daresay you haven't had
much practice.

35:56.102 --> 35:58.915
When I was your age,
I did for half an hour every day.

35:58.961 --> 36:06.500
Why sometimes, I believed as many as
six impossible things before breakfast.

36:08.671 --> 36:11.341
There goes my shawl again!

36:15.991 --> 36:19.111
I hope your finger is better now.

36:46.588 --> 36:48.532
What is it you wish to buy?

36:49.073 --> 36:50.244
Um...

36:50.299 --> 36:52.487
I don't quite know yet.

36:52.565 --> 36:55.487
I should like to look
all around me first if I might.

36:55.580 --> 36:57.205
You may look in front of you.

36:57.268 --> 36:58.713
Or on both sides if you like.

36:58.737 --> 37:02.838
But, you can't look behind you, unless
you have eyes in the back of your head.

37:06.504 --> 37:08.782
<i>Things flow about so here.</i>

37:11.087 --> 37:12.649
<i>It's the most provoking.</i>

37:12.703 --> 37:15.462
Are you a child or a spinning top?
You make me giddy.

37:15.504 --> 37:17.134
Turning around like that.

37:17.376 --> 37:18.603
Um...

37:18.639 --> 37:20.609
I should like to buy...

37:20.742 --> 37:23.195
an egg, please.

37:25.004 --> 37:26.900
How do you sell them?

37:28.564 --> 37:32.979
Fivepence farting for one,
twopence for two.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.550
Then two is cheaper than one?

37:34.582 --> 37:38.082
But, you must eat them both
if you buy two.

37:38.481 --> 37:39.872
Then I'll have one, please.

37:39.904 --> 37:42.029
They might not be at all nice,
you know.

37:45.849 --> 37:48.513
I've never put things
into people's hands.

37:50.868 --> 37:52.708
That would never do.

38:01.159 --> 38:03.245
You must get it yourself.

38:05.073 --> 38:07.472
I wonder why it wouldn't do?

38:10.550 --> 38:15.278
Oh, the egg seems to get further away
the more I walk towards it.

38:23.704 --> 38:26.788
How very odd to find trees growing here.

38:27.507 --> 38:30.850
Well, this's the very queerest shop
I ever saw.

39:02.712 --> 39:04.316
Humpty Dumpty.

39:04.511 --> 39:06.566
It can't be anybody else.

39:06.764 --> 39:09.066
And how exactly like an egg he is.

39:09.151 --> 39:12.449
It's very provoking
to be called an egg.

39:12.519 --> 39:13.708
Very.

39:13.800 --> 39:16.441
I said you looked like an egg, sir.

39:16.574 --> 39:19.316
And, and some eggs are very pretty,
you know?

39:19.386 --> 39:23.660
Some people have no more
sense than a baby.

39:24.467 --> 39:28.484
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall

39:28.564 --> 39:30.803
All the King's horses
and all the King's men

39:30.843 --> 39:33.382
Couldn't put Humpty in his place again.

39:34.085 --> 39:37.094
That last line is much
too long for a poetry.

39:38.781 --> 39:40.703
Why do you sit out here all alone?

39:40.773 --> 39:42.211
Why?

39:42.328 --> 39:44.539
Because there is nobody with me,
of course.

39:44.593 --> 39:46.913
Well, don't you think you'll be
much safer on the ground?

39:47.007 --> 39:48.312
That wall is very narrow.

39:48.352 --> 39:53.711
What tremendously easy riddles, you ask.
Why, of course, I don't think so.

39:53.813 --> 39:56.868
Why, if I did fall,
which there's no chance of.

39:56.978 --> 39:59.689
But, if I did, if I did fall,

39:59.790 --> 40:02.227
the King has promised me...

40:02.267 --> 40:06.478
ahhhh... you didn't think
I was going to say that, did you?

40:06.712 --> 40:09.900
The King has promised me,
with his very own mouth,

40:09.947 --> 40:12.971
- to...
- Send all his horses and all his men.

40:13.339 --> 40:15.378
Now, I declare that's too bad.

40:15.433 --> 40:18.269
You've been listening at doors,
and behind trees, and down chimneys

40:18.300 --> 40:20.776
- or you couldn't have known it.
- I haven't indeed. It's in the book.

40:20.824 --> 40:23.527
Well, they may write
such thing in the book.

40:24.496 --> 40:26.620
Now, take a good look at me.

40:26.699 --> 40:30.027
I'm one that has spoken to the King, I am.

40:30.104 --> 40:34.729
And to show I'm not proud,
you may shake hands with me.

40:40.296 --> 40:42.257
How old did you say you were?

40:42.327 --> 40:44.194
I'm uh seven years and six months.

40:44.233 --> 40:45.764
You never said a word like it.

40:45.851 --> 40:47.741
Yeah, but, I thought
you meant how old am I.

40:47.785 --> 40:50.822
If I meant that,
I'd have said it.

40:50.882 --> 40:56.387
Now, if you'd ask my advice,
I'd have said: Leave off  at "seven".

40:56.468 --> 40:58.179
But, it's too late now.

40:58.281 --> 41:00.648
You seem very good at explaining things.

41:00.739 --> 41:04.218
I wonder would you tell me, please,
the meaning of the poem "Jabberwocky"?

41:04.507 --> 41:08.742
I can explain every poem
that were invented.

41:08.860 --> 41:12.968
And a good deal
that haven't been invented yet.

41:13.739 --> 41:19.078
Twas brillig, and the slithy toves.

41:23.648 --> 41:28.644
<i>Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:</i>

41:28.817 --> 41:33.977
<i>All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.</i>

41:34.430 --> 41:39.445
<i>Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!</i>

41:39.508 --> 41:44.038
<i>Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!</i>

41:46.411 --> 41:51.936
<i>He took his vorpal sword in hand;
Long time the manxome foe he sought</i>

41:52.188 --> 41:57.897
<i>So rested he by the Tumtum tree
And stood awhile in thought.</i>

41:58.863 --> 42:04.460
<i>And, as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,</i>

42:04.598 --> 42:09.825
<i>Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!</i>

42:10.726 --> 42:16.091
<i>One, two! One, two! And through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!</i>

42:16.204 --> 42:20.844
<i>He left it dead, and with its head
He left it dead, and with its head</i>

42:22.062 --> 42:26.883
<i>And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!</i>

42:27.001 --> 42:32.708
<i>O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”
He chortled in his joy.</i>

42:32.862 --> 42:38.545
<i>Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:</i>

42:38.708 --> 42:45.614
<i>All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.</i>

42:48.710 --> 42:52.411
Plenty of hard words there
for you, huh, huh?

42:53.473 --> 42:55.903
Well, Briling means 4 o'clock
in the afternoon,

42:55.958 --> 42:58.153
the time when you start
broiling things for dinner.

42:58.189 --> 43:00.747
That would do very well.
And, and "slithy"?

43:00.772 --> 43:04.124
Well, "slithy" means "lithe and slimy".

43:04.489 --> 43:06.810
You see, it's like a portmanteau,

43:06.857 --> 43:09.162
there're two meanings
packed up into one word.

43:09.239 --> 43:11.098
I can see that now.

43:11.224 --> 43:13.832
Hhh, what's "gyre" and "gimble"?

43:13.896 --> 43:15.521
To gyre...

43:15.591 --> 43:18.443
is to go round and round
like a gyroscope.

43:18.487 --> 43:21.358
To gimble is to make a hole like a gimlet.

43:21.410 --> 43:25.029
And a wabe is a grass-plot
around a sundial, I suppose.

43:25.137 --> 43:26.378
Well, of course, it is.

43:26.433 --> 43:27.691
It's called the wabe

43:27.745 --> 43:31.597
because it goes a long way before it
and the long way behind it.

43:31.637 --> 43:34.027
And the long way
beyond it on each side?

43:34.052 --> 43:35.089
Exactly.

43:35.120 --> 43:37.996
And "mimsy" means
"flimsy" and "miserable".

43:38.058 --> 43:40.331
There's another portmanteau for you.

43:40.394 --> 43:41.918
And a "borogove", ooh,

43:41.980 --> 43:44.996
a thin, shabby-looking bird with
feathers sticking out all around.

43:45.035 --> 43:46.808
Something like a live mop.

43:46.863 --> 43:48.551
And what's "outgrabe"?

43:48.589 --> 43:50.730
Well, "outgribing"

43:50.785 --> 43:53.332
is something between
bellowing and whistling,

43:53.395 --> 43:55.214
with a sort of sneeze in the middle.

43:55.293 --> 43:59.683
However, you’ll hear it done,
maybe, down in the wood yonder.

43:59.761 --> 44:01.722
And once you’ve heard it,

44:01.949 --> 44:04.238
you’ll be quite content.

44:04.770 --> 44:06.981
That's all.
Goodnight.

44:09.415 --> 44:11.157
Goodbye.
Till we meet again.

44:11.220 --> 44:13.243
Well, I should know you again
if we did meet.

44:13.431 --> 44:15.416
You're so like other people.

44:15.487 --> 44:19.026
Two eyes, so, nose in the middle,
mouth under.

44:19.111 --> 44:20.674
It's always the same.

44:20.721 --> 44:24.636
Now, if you have the two eyes
on the same side of your nose,

44:24.691 --> 44:27.417
and the mouth on top,
that would be some help.

44:27.456 --> 44:28.675
But, it wouldn't look nice.

44:28.728 --> 44:31.620
Wait!
Till you've tried.

44:32.807 --> 44:34.112
Goodbye.

44:44.482 --> 44:46.709
All the unsatisfactory...

44:49.524 --> 44:53.078
All the unsatisfactory people
I've ever met.

44:54.144 --> 44:57.683
Wait.
Till you've tried.

46:26.567 --> 46:28.741
I've sent them all.

46:30.371 --> 46:33.372
Did you happen to meet any soldier,
my dear, as you came through the woods?

46:33.653 --> 46:37.105
Yes, I did.
Several thousand, I should think?

46:37.292 --> 46:39.608
Four thousand, two hundred and seven.

46:39.906 --> 46:41.422
That's the axact number.

46:42.732 --> 46:44.403
I couldn't send all the horses,
you know,

46:44.435 --> 46:46.771
because two of them
are wanted in the game.

46:47.064 --> 46:49.153
I haven't sent the two messengers either.

46:49.248 --> 46:51.122
They're both gone to town.

46:51.810 --> 46:56.084
Just... look around along the road
and tell me if you can see either of them.

46:57.984 --> 47:00.225
I see nobody on the road.

47:00.695 --> 47:03.555
I only wish I had such eyes
to be able to see "nobody".

47:03.719 --> 47:05.727
And at that distance too.

47:06.243 --> 47:10.657
Why, it's as much as I can do to see
real people, by this light.

47:10.913 --> 47:13.351
No, I can see somebody now.

47:13.812 --> 47:16.085
But, he's coming very slowly.

47:16.147 --> 47:18.687
What curious attitudes he goes into!

47:18.742 --> 47:20.031
Not at all.

47:20.140 --> 47:24.359
He's an Anglo-Saxon messenger
and those are Anglo-Saxon attitudes.

47:26.108 --> 47:28.203
He only does them when he's happy.

47:28.703 --> 47:32.250
Hie name is Haigha.

47:32.484 --> 47:33.500
With an "H".

47:33.525 --> 47:36.719
I love my love with an "H",
because he is happy.

47:36.989 --> 47:40.330
I hate him with an H,
because he is hideous.

47:40.409 --> 47:44.989
I feed him with
ham sanwiches and hay.

47:45.207 --> 47:46.980
His name is Haigha...

47:47.027 --> 47:49.457
- and he lives in...
- He lives on the hill.

47:49.921 --> 47:51.715
The other messenger is called Hatta.

47:51.828 --> 47:54.242
I must have two, you know,
to come and go.

47:54.900 --> 47:56.914
One to come, one to go.

47:57.047 --> 47:58.399
I beg your pardon?

47:58.514 --> 48:00.639
It isn't respectable to beg.

48:00.866 --> 48:04.202
No, I mean I don't understand.
Why one to come and one to go?

48:04.233 --> 48:05.587
But, don't I tell you?

48:05.657 --> 48:07.766
I must have two,
to fetch and carry.

48:07.942 --> 48:10.296
One to fetch, one to carry.

48:12.656 --> 48:15.664
This young lady loves you with an H.

48:18.696 --> 48:21.416
You alarm me.
I feel faint.

48:21.683 --> 48:23.854
Give me a ham sandwich.

48:29.559 --> 48:32.755
- Another sandwich.
- There's nothing but hay left now.

48:32.925 --> 48:34.629
Hay then.

48:39.535 --> 48:41.949
Nothing like eating hay when you faint.

48:42.270 --> 48:45.082
I should think throwing cold water
over you would be better.

48:45.121 --> 48:48.699
I didn't say there was nothing better.
I said there was nothing like it.

48:48.824 --> 48:51.355
- Who did you pass on the road?
- Nobody.

48:51.457 --> 48:53.816
Quite right.
This young lady saw him too.

48:53.965 --> 48:56.871
So, of course,
nobody walks slower than you.

48:56.957 --> 48:58.520
I do my best.

48:58.638 --> 49:01.005
I'm sure nobody walks
much fater than I do.

49:01.066 --> 49:04.592
He can't do that.
Or else he'd have been here first.

49:06.285 --> 49:08.191
However, now you got your breath,

49:08.254 --> 49:10.262
you may tell us
what's happening in the town.

49:10.342 --> 49:12.390
I'll whisper it.

49:12.805 --> 49:14.680
They're at it again!!!

49:14.773 --> 49:16.148
You call that a whisper?

49:16.211 --> 49:18.337
If you do such thing again,
I'll have you buttered.

49:18.391 --> 49:20.633
It went through and through
my head like an earthquake!

49:20.695 --> 49:22.665
It would have to be
a very tiny earthquake.

49:22.728 --> 49:23.869
Huh?

49:24.034 --> 49:25.673
Who are at it again?

49:25.837 --> 49:28.298
Why, the Lion and the Unicorn,
of course.

49:28.372 --> 49:30.243
- Fighting for the crown?
- Yes.

49:30.313 --> 49:34.531
To be sure, and the best of the joke is,
it's my crown, all the while.

49:34.602 --> 49:36.500
Let's run and see them.

50:09.713 --> 50:12.346
You're... my prisoner.

50:22.646 --> 50:25.689
- Ahoy! Ahoy!
- Check!

50:36.621 --> 50:39.154
She's my prisoner.
You know?

50:39.249 --> 50:42.257
Yes.
But, I came and rescued her.

50:42.419 --> 50:45.710
Well, we must fight for her then.

50:45.828 --> 50:48.882
You'll observe the Rule of Battle,
of course?

50:51.274 --> 50:52.865
I always do.

51:05.923 --> 51:09.839
What I wonder now,
what the Rules of Battle are?

51:13.874 --> 51:15.296
One rule seems to be that...

51:15.359 --> 51:19.117
if one knight hits the other,
he knocks him off his horse.

51:23.482 --> 51:26.404
And if he misses it,
he tumbles off himself.

51:30.798 --> 51:32.735
And another rule seems to be
that they...

51:32.884 --> 51:35.095
hold their clubs with their arms
as if they are...

51:35.399 --> 51:37.345
Punch and Judy.

51:41.991 --> 51:45.665
And another rule seems to be that
they always fall on their heads.

51:53.783 --> 51:55.627
Battle's over.

52:09.600 --> 52:11.084
Oh.

52:14.696 --> 52:18.790
That was a glorious...

52:19.142 --> 52:21.321
victory, wasn't it?

52:21.353 --> 52:22.470
Well, I don't know.

52:22.495 --> 52:24.119
I don't want to be anybody's prisoner.

52:24.165 --> 52:26.846
- I want to be a Queen.
- So you will be.

52:27.424 --> 52:30.104
When you've crossed the next brook.

52:31.008 --> 52:33.345
I'll see you save
to the end of the wood.

52:33.502 --> 52:35.072
And...

52:35.275 --> 52:37.705
then I must go back, you know?

52:38.072 --> 52:40.197
That's the end of my move.

52:40.310 --> 52:42.166
Thank you very much.

52:42.205 --> 52:44.221
Would you like me
to help you off with your helmet?

52:44.252 --> 52:45.802
Yes, please.

53:03.517 --> 53:06.939
I see you're admiring my little box.

53:08.031 --> 53:09.852
It's my own invention.

53:10.102 --> 53:12.266
To keep clothes and sandwiches in.

53:12.625 --> 53:15.570
I carry it upside down,
you see?

53:15.672 --> 53:17.860
So, the rain can't get it.

53:17.992 --> 53:20.086
But, the things can get out.

53:20.211 --> 53:22.266
Do you know the lid's open?

53:24.024 --> 53:26.039
No, I didn't know it.

53:26.313 --> 53:28.969
That means all the things had fallen out.

53:30.456 --> 53:33.066
The box is no use without them.

53:47.873 --> 53:49.249
Can you...?

53:50.438 --> 53:53.040
Can you guess why I did that?

53:54.735 --> 53:58.392
I hope some bees may make a nest in it.

53:58.696 --> 54:00.767
Then I should get the honey.

54:01.575 --> 54:03.544
But, you've got a beehive.

54:03.607 --> 54:07.661
Or something very like one,
fastened to the saddle.

54:12.830 --> 54:14.556
Yes, I have.

54:15.517 --> 54:19.275
It's a very good beehive.
One of the very best kind.

54:19.439 --> 54:22.017
But not a single bee has come near it yet.

54:22.205 --> 54:23.650
Um...

54:24.029 --> 54:26.307
And the other thing is a mouse-trap.

54:27.022 --> 54:30.312
I suppose the mice keep the bees out,
or the bees keep the mice out.

54:30.358 --> 54:32.054
Or the other,
I don't know which.

54:32.218 --> 54:34.718
Ah, I was wondering
what the mouse-trap's for.

54:34.843 --> 54:37.805
It isn't very likely there would be
any mice on the horse's back.

54:37.835 --> 54:39.468
Not very likely, perhaps.

54:39.523 --> 54:40.578
But, if they do come,

54:40.625 --> 54:43.671
I don't choose to have them
running all about.

54:44.227 --> 54:47.009
It's as well to be provided
for everyhting, you see.

54:47.188 --> 54:48.837
I mean that's the reason...

54:48.915 --> 54:51.674
the horse has these anklets
round his feet.

54:53.196 --> 54:55.032
What are they for?

54:56.405 --> 54:59.673
To guard against the bites of sharks.

55:01.759 --> 55:04.970
It's an invention of my own.
And now, help me on, please.

55:05.134 --> 55:07.821
I'll walk with you to the end of the food.

55:08.954 --> 55:10.681
What's that dish for?

55:10.885 --> 55:12.221
Um...

55:12.362 --> 55:14.573
it's meant for plum cake.

55:14.884 --> 55:16.556
Ah, we'd better take it with us.

55:16.588 --> 55:19.143
It might come in handly
if we find any plum cake.

55:19.254 --> 55:21.517
Help me to get it into this thing.

55:22.712 --> 55:25.556
Yes, hold it tight, please.

55:25.650 --> 55:28.986
There're a lot of candlesticks in here.

55:33.614 --> 55:36.231
Have you got your hair well fastened on?

55:36.318 --> 55:38.131
Only in the usual way.

55:38.192 --> 55:42.013
That's hardly enough.
The wind is so very strong here.

55:42.284 --> 55:43.823
It's as strong as soup.

55:43.894 --> 55:46.583
Have you invented a plan for keeping
the hair from being blown off?

55:46.622 --> 55:47.956
Not yet.

55:48.097 --> 55:50.753
But, I've got a plan
for keeping it from falling off.

55:50.846 --> 55:52.933
Well, I should like to hear it,
very much.

55:53.011 --> 55:55.441
Well first, you take an upright stick.

55:55.512 --> 55:58.356
Then you make your hair creep up it,
like a fruit tree.

55:58.465 --> 56:01.144
Now, the reason hair falls off is
because it hangs down.

56:01.223 --> 56:03.786
Things never fall off upwards.

56:04.121 --> 56:06.653
You see, it's a plan of my own invention.

56:09.778 --> 56:12.082
You may try it if you like.

56:12.750 --> 56:15.883
I'm afraid you haven't had
much practice in riding.

56:16.024 --> 56:17.743
What makes you think that?

56:17.891 --> 56:21.821
Because people don't fall off quite
so often when they've had much practice.

56:25.564 --> 56:28.417
I've had plenty of practice.

56:28.636 --> 56:30.144
Plenty of practice.

56:34.873 --> 56:36.918
Plenty of practice.

56:36.989 --> 56:38.622
Indeed.

56:55.127 --> 56:58.372
The great art of riding's he...

56:58.927 --> 57:00.692
The great art of...

57:02.450 --> 57:05.098
I hope no bones are broken?

57:08.236 --> 57:10.094
None to speak of.

57:12.962 --> 57:14.931
Mmm...

57:15.727 --> 57:17.548
It's too ridiculous.

57:17.603 --> 57:20.438
You ought to have a wooden horse
on wheels, that you ought.

57:20.493 --> 57:24.257
- Does that kind go smoothly?
- Much more smootly than a live horse.

57:24.288 --> 57:25.510
Well then, I'll get one.

57:25.603 --> 57:28.245
Well, one or two.
Several.

57:29.234 --> 57:32.297
I'm a great hand at inventing things,
you know?

57:32.524 --> 57:36.290
I daresay you noticed,
the last time you picked me up,

57:36.383 --> 57:38.446
I was looking rather thoughtful.

57:38.618 --> 57:40.681
You were a little grave.

57:40.822 --> 57:43.243
Just then, I was thinking a new way
of getting over the gate.

57:43.275 --> 57:45.580
- Would you like to hear it?
- Very much, indeed.

57:45.650 --> 57:48.056
But uh, I'll tell you
how I came to think of it.

57:49.321 --> 57:51.470
You see, I said to myself.

57:51.533 --> 57:55.580
The only difficulty is with the feet.
The head is high enough already.

57:55.783 --> 57:56.791
Now...

57:56.872 --> 58:00.368
First, I put my... head on the gate.

58:00.494 --> 58:02.173
Then the head's high.

58:02.921 --> 58:06.369
Then I stand on my head,
my feet are high now.

58:06.659 --> 58:07.792
You see?

58:07.843 --> 58:10.370
And I'm over.
You see?

58:11.933 --> 58:15.034
I suppose you'd be over
by the time you'd done that, but...

58:15.230 --> 58:17.628
don't you think it would be rather hard?

58:20.552 --> 58:23.645
Well, I haven't tried it yet,
so I can't tell for certain.

58:23.888 --> 58:25.060
But,...

58:25.140 --> 58:27.125
I'm afraid it would be a little hard.

58:31.005 --> 58:34.411
How can you go on talking so quietly,
head downwards?

58:34.459 --> 58:37.420
What does it matter where my body...

58:37.452 --> 58:39.616
- Argh... Oh...
- happens to be?

58:40.522 --> 58:44.249
My mind goes on working all the same.

58:44.850 --> 58:48.467
In fact, the more head-downwards
I happen to be,

58:48.522 --> 58:50.936
the more I keep inventing new thngs.

58:51.553 --> 58:54.772
The cleverest thing I ever did...

58:59.810 --> 59:03.396
The cleverest thing
I ever did... of the sort...

59:03.670 --> 59:06.373
was inventing a new pudding
during the meat cource.

59:06.420 --> 59:08.528
In time to have it cooked
for the next course?

59:08.553 --> 59:10.295
Well, that was quick work, certainly.

59:10.350 --> 59:12.132
No, not the next course.

59:12.171 --> 59:14.335
Certainly, not the next course.

59:14.382 --> 59:16.039
Then it would have to be the next day?

59:16.102 --> 59:19.632
I suppose, you wouldn't have
two pudding-courses in one dinner?

59:19.890 --> 59:22.677
No, not the next day.

59:23.595 --> 59:25.656
No, not the next day.

59:28.187 --> 59:29.578
In fact,...

59:30.062 --> 59:32.032
I don't believe
that pudding ever was cooked.

59:32.063 --> 59:34.438
In fact, I don't believe
that pudding ever will be cooked.

59:34.539 --> 59:38.148
And yet, it was a very
clever pudding to invent.

59:40.282 --> 59:42.563
What did you mean it to be made of?

59:43.666 --> 59:45.641
It began with blotting-paper.

59:45.743 --> 59:48.023
That wouldn't be very nice, I'm afraid.

59:48.086 --> 59:49.656
Not very nice alone.

59:49.680 --> 59:51.344
You've no idea
the difference it makes,

59:51.383 --> 59:54.727
mixing it with other things
like gunpowder and sealing-wax.

59:56.325 --> 59:58.266
And here, I must leave you.

01:00:05.226 --> 01:00:06.899
You're sad.

01:00:10.425 --> 01:00:12.493
Let me tell you a tale...

01:00:12.712 --> 01:00:14.181
to comfort you.

01:00:14.602 --> 01:00:16.298
Is it very long?

01:00:16.415 --> 01:00:18.478
Yes, it's long.

01:00:19.259 --> 01:00:21.290
But, it's very, very beautiful.

01:00:22.337 --> 01:00:24.697
Everybody that hears me say it,

01:00:24.861 --> 01:00:27.916
it either brings the tears
into their eyes, or else...

01:00:28.032 --> 01:00:29.783
Or else what?

01:00:31.599 --> 01:00:33.521
Or else, it doesn't, you know?

01:00:35.679 --> 01:00:38.404
The name of the tale is called
"Haddocks' Eyes".

01:00:39.241 --> 01:00:41.217
That's the name of the tale, is it?

01:00:42.627 --> 01:00:44.834
No, it's something quite different.

01:00:46.327 --> 01:00:48.217
That's what the name of the tale is called.

01:00:48.265 --> 01:00:52.085
The name really is: The Aged, Aged Man.

01:00:52.491 --> 01:00:57.437
Oh! So, I ought to have said:
That's what the tale is called?

01:00:58.256 --> 01:00:59.976
No, you oughtn't.

01:01:00.078 --> 01:01:01.984
That's quite another thing.

01:01:02.374 --> 01:01:04.710
The tale is called...

01:01:05.508 --> 01:01:08.648
Ways and Means.
But, that's only what the tale is called.

01:01:08.852 --> 01:01:10.586
- You see?
- Hmm...

01:01:10.656 --> 01:01:12.594
What is the tale then?

01:01:12.719 --> 01:01:14.649
I'm coming to that.

01:01:17.759 --> 01:01:20.609
The tale really is...

01:01:22.362 --> 01:01:24.424
A-sitting On a Gate.

01:01:26.579 --> 01:01:30.478
I'll tell thee everything I can:
There's little to relate.

01:01:31.328 --> 01:01:34.861
I saw an aged, aged man,
A-sitting on a gate.

01:01:35.685 --> 01:01:38.524
"Who are you, aged man?" I said,

01:01:40.327 --> 01:01:42.469
"And how is it you live?"

01:01:42.911 --> 01:01:46.703
And his answer trickled through my head,
Like water through a sieve.

01:01:47.458 --> 01:01:53.000
He said "I look for butterflies
That sleep among the wheat,

01:01:53.223 --> 01:01:57.326
I turn them into mutton-pies,
Ans sell them in the streets.

01:01:58.070 --> 01:02:01.522
I sell them unto men," he said,
"Who sail on stormy seas;

01:02:01.741 --> 01:02:05.961
And that's the way I get my bread
A trifle, if you please."

01:02:07.878 --> 01:02:12.044
But I was thinking of a plan
To dye one's whiskers green,

01:02:12.355 --> 01:02:15.878
And always use so large a fan
That they could not be seen.

01:02:16.717 --> 01:02:20.092
So, having no reply to give
To what the old man said,

01:02:20.428 --> 01:02:24.428
I cried "Come, tell me how you live!"
And thumped him on the head.

01:02:25.835 --> 01:02:29.898
His accents mild took up the tale:
He said "I go my ways,

01:02:30.108 --> 01:02:33.976
And when I find a mountain-rill,
I set it in a blaze;

01:02:34.196 --> 01:02:38.189
And thence they make a stuff they call
Rowlands' Macassar-Oil

01:02:38.884 --> 01:02:42.454
Yet twopence-halfpenny is all
They give me for my toil."

01:02:45.384 --> 01:02:50.853
But I was thinking of a way
To feed oneself on batter,

01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:55.588
And so go on from day to day
Getting a little fatter.

01:02:57.025 --> 01:03:02.088
I shook him well from side to side,
Until his face was blue:

01:03:02.272 --> 01:03:08.030
"Come, tell me how you live," I cried,
"And what it is you do!"

01:03:10.015 --> 01:03:15.909
He said "I hunt for haddocks' eyes
Among the heather bright,

01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:21.201
And work them into waistcoat-buttons
In the silent night.

01:03:22.601 --> 01:03:28.358
And these I do not sell for gold
Or coin of silvery shine,

01:03:28.929 --> 01:03:33.289
But for a copper halfpenny,
And that will purchase nine.

01:03:34.398 --> 01:03:39.685
"I sometimes dig for buttered rolls,
Or set limed twigs for crabs:

01:03:40.049 --> 01:03:45.213
I sometimes search the grassy knolls
For wheels of Hansom-cabs.

01:03:45.611 --> 01:03:49.307
And that's the way" he gave a wink
"By which I get my wealth

01:03:49.636 --> 01:03:54.136
And very gladly will I drink
Your Honour's noble health."

01:03:58.970 --> 01:04:04.533
I heard him then, for I had just
Completed my design

01:04:05.095 --> 01:04:10.158
To keep the Menai bridge from rust
By boiling it in wine.

01:04:11.791 --> 01:04:16.455
I thanked him much for telling me
The way he got his wealth,

01:04:16.759 --> 01:04:21.944
But chiefly for his wish that he
Might drink my noble health.

01:04:24.857 --> 01:04:27.939
And now, if e'er by chance I put
My fingers into glue,

01:04:27.994 --> 01:04:32.759
Or madly squeeze a right-hand foot
Into a left-hand shoe,

01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:35.940
Or if I drop upon my toe
A very heavy weight,

01:04:35.979 --> 01:04:40.666
I weep, for it reminds me so
Of that old man I used to know

01:04:41.455 --> 01:04:47.776
Whose look was mild, whose speech was slow
Whose hair was whiter than the snow,

01:04:47.893 --> 01:04:52.424
Whose face was very like a crow,
With eyes, like cinders, all aglow,

01:04:52.565 --> 01:04:57.276
Who seemed distracted with his woe,
Who rocked his body to and fro,

01:04:57.339 --> 01:05:01.675
And muttered mumblingly and low,
As if his mouth were full of dough,

01:05:01.776 --> 01:05:04.362
Who snorted like a buffalo

01:05:05.574 --> 01:05:07.894
That summer evening long ago,

01:05:08.965 --> 01:05:10.933
A-sitting on a gate.

01:05:24.281 --> 01:05:26.750
You've only a few yards to go now.

01:05:27.391 --> 01:05:31.070
Down the hill and over that brook,
and you'll be a Queen.

01:05:31.409 --> 01:05:33.316
But, I need you...

01:05:33.472 --> 01:05:35.800
to stay and see me off first.

01:05:35.878 --> 01:05:37.917
I, I shan't be long.

01:05:38.628 --> 01:05:43.097
You'll wait and wave your handkershief
when I get to that turn in the road.

01:05:44.128 --> 01:05:46.698
I think it'll encourage me, you see?

01:05:47.073 --> 01:05:48.730
Of course, I will.

01:05:48.944 --> 01:05:51.198
And thank you so much
for coming this far.

01:05:51.277 --> 01:05:52.660
And for the tale.

01:05:52.753 --> 01:05:54.620
I liked it very much.

01:05:54.785 --> 01:05:56.339
I hope so.

01:05:57.683 --> 01:06:00.480
But, you didn't cry so much
as I thought you would.

01:06:11.665 --> 01:06:15.616
It won't take long to see him off,
I expect.

01:06:16.967 --> 01:06:18.687
There he goes.

01:06:18.758 --> 01:06:20.984
Right on his head as usual.

01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:24.539
However, he gets on again pretty easily.

01:06:24.657 --> 01:06:27.962
That comes of haing so many things
hung around the horse.

01:06:37.273 --> 01:06:39.610
I hope it encouraged him.

01:06:41.727 --> 01:06:45.029
And now for the final brook
and to be a Queen.

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:47.707
How grand it sounds!

01:07:06.105 --> 01:07:08.816
My old bones.

01:07:10.770 --> 01:07:13.160
My old bones.

01:07:13.504 --> 01:07:16.035
My old bones.

01:07:16.176 --> 01:07:17.645
Oh.

01:07:18.526 --> 01:07:21.730
It's rheumatism, I should think.

01:07:22.375 --> 01:07:24.110
I hope you're not in much pain?

01:07:24.196 --> 01:07:27.671
Oh,... dear, indeed.

01:07:27.923 --> 01:07:30.023
Can I do anything for you?

01:07:30.096 --> 01:07:31.658
Yeah.

01:07:35.057 --> 01:07:37.087
Aren't you rather cold here?

01:07:37.158 --> 01:07:38.525
How you go along!

01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:42.253
Worrity, worrity.
There never was such a child!

01:07:43.112 --> 01:07:45.221
Won't you let me walk you
round to the other side?

01:07:45.276 --> 01:07:47.535
- Ohh...
- You’ll be out of the cold wind there.

01:07:47.613 --> 01:07:51.362
Worrity, worrity, worrity!

01:07:52.179 --> 01:07:54.648
Can’t you leave a body alone?

01:07:54.817 --> 01:07:56.684
Would you like me
to read you a bit of this?

01:07:56.715 --> 01:08:01.129
You may read it if you’ve a mind to,
Nobody’s hindering you that I know of.

01:08:11.350 --> 01:08:12.679
Latest News.

01:08:12.734 --> 01:08:15.598
The Exploring Party have made
another tour in the Pantry,

01:08:15.647 --> 01:08:18.310
and have found
five new lumps of white sugar.

01:08:18.482 --> 01:08:20.662
Large and in fine condition.

01:08:20.862 --> 01:08:23.502
- In coming back,...
- Any brown sugar?

01:08:23.983 --> 01:08:26.749
N... no.
It says nothing about brown.

01:08:26.796 --> 01:08:28.593
No brown sugar.

01:08:28.733 --> 01:08:31.206
A nice exploring party.

01:08:32.417 --> 01:08:35.203
In coming back,
they had a sad accident.

01:08:35.251 --> 01:08:37.462
Two of their party were engulfed.

01:08:38.233 --> 01:08:39.571
Where what?

01:08:39.743 --> 01:08:41.157
Engulfed.

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:44.260
There's no such word in the language.

01:08:44.643 --> 01:08:46.220
But, it's in this paper.

01:08:46.267 --> 01:08:48.236
Let it stop there.

01:08:51.982 --> 01:08:53.822
You're not well at all.

01:08:53.924 --> 01:08:56.229
Can I do anything for you?

01:08:58.866 --> 01:09:01.886
It’s all along of the wig.

01:09:02.511 --> 01:09:03.527
Along of the wig?

01:09:03.566 --> 01:09:06.596
You would be cross too
if you had a wig like mine.

01:09:06.746 --> 01:09:09.136
They jokes at one.
And they worrits one.

01:09:09.198 --> 01:09:11.910
And then I gets cross.
And I gets cold.

01:09:11.957 --> 01:09:13.810
And I gets under a tree.

01:09:13.948 --> 01:09:17.129
And I gets a yellow handkerchief.

01:09:17.216 --> 01:09:19.645
And I ties up my face.

01:09:19.848 --> 01:09:22.263
As at the present.

01:09:22.477 --> 01:09:24.938
Tying up the face is very good
for the toothache.

01:09:24.973 --> 01:09:27.055
And it’s very good for the conceit.

01:09:27.126 --> 01:09:28.501
Is that a kind of toothache?

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:30.697
Well, no.

01:09:30.862 --> 01:09:37.198
It’s when you hold your head up,
so, without bending your neck.

01:09:37.412 --> 01:09:38.823
Oh, you mean stiff-neck.

01:09:38.863 --> 01:09:40.988
Oh, that’s a new fangled name.

01:09:41.062 --> 01:09:43.412
It was called "conceit" in my day.

01:09:43.492 --> 01:09:45.115
Conceit isn’t a disease at all.

01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:46.804
It is, though.

01:09:47.062 --> 01:09:49.288
Wait till you have it,
and then you’ll know.

01:09:49.384 --> 01:09:51.408
And when you catches it,...

01:09:51.533 --> 01:09:53.385
just try...

01:09:53.479 --> 01:09:55.831
tying a yellow handkerchief...

01:09:55.939 --> 01:09:57.729
round your face.

01:09:57.861 --> 01:10:01.416
It will cure you in no time!

01:10:07.698 --> 01:10:10.003
Your wig would be much neater
if you have a comb.

01:10:10.058 --> 01:10:13.167
What?
You’re a Bee, are you?

01:10:13.308 --> 01:10:15.769
And you’ve got a comb.

01:10:15.847 --> 01:10:17.003
Mmm-hhh.

01:10:17.066 --> 01:10:18.714
Much honey?

01:10:18.795 --> 01:10:22.034
Not that sort of comb.
It’s to comb hair with.

01:10:22.597 --> 01:10:25.277
Your wig is so very rough, you know?

01:10:25.928 --> 01:10:28.887
I’ll tell you...

01:10:29.176 --> 01:10:31.934
how I came to put it on.

01:10:35.126 --> 01:10:41.497
“When I was young, my ringlets waved
And curled and crinkled on my head:

01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:47.865
And then they said ‘You should be shaved,
And wear a yellow wig instead.’

01:10:48.330 --> 01:10:52.663
But when I followed their advice,
And they had witnessed the effect,

01:10:52.794 --> 01:10:57.495
They said I did not look so nice
As they had ventured to expect.

01:10:57.925 --> 01:11:04.545
They said the wig did not fit, and so
It made me look extremely plain:

01:11:04.766 --> 01:11:09.806
But what was I to do, you know?
My ringlets would not grow again.

01:11:10.398 --> 01:11:16.774
And now that I am old and grey,
And all my hair is nearly gone,

01:11:16.989 --> 01:11:23.110
They take my wig from me and say
‘How can you put such rubbish on?’

01:11:23.789 --> 01:11:29.305
And still, whenever I appear,
They hoot at me and call me ‘Pig!’

01:11:30.005 --> 01:11:35.797
And that is why they do it, dear,
Because I wear a yellow wig.”

01:11:38.304 --> 01:11:40.758
I am very sorry for you.

01:11:41.336 --> 01:11:42.680
And I think...

01:11:42.735 --> 01:11:46.993
if your wig fitted a little better, then
they wouldn’t tease you quite so much.

01:11:47.109 --> 01:11:50.406
Your wig fits very well.

01:11:50.501 --> 01:11:53.461
It’s the shape of your head that does it.

01:11:53.633 --> 01:11:56.477
Your jaws are not well shaped, though.

01:11:56.548 --> 01:11:59.603
I should think you couldn’t bite well.

01:11:59.930 --> 01:12:04.258
- I can bite anything I want.
- Not with a mouth as small as that.

01:12:05.214 --> 01:12:07.168
If you was a fighting now,

01:12:07.246 --> 01:12:10.762
Could you get hold of the other one
by the back of the neck?

01:12:11.096 --> 01:12:12.332
I’m afraid not.

01:12:12.379 --> 01:12:14.918
Well, that’s because
your jaws are too short.

01:12:15.059 --> 01:12:19.389
But, the top of your head
is nice and smooth.

01:12:20.451 --> 01:12:22.489
Then, your eyes...

01:12:23.138 --> 01:12:25.490
they’re too much in front.

01:12:26.669 --> 01:12:31.474
One would have done as well as two,
if you must have them so close.

01:12:33.334 --> 01:12:36.943
I think I must be going on now.
Goodbye.

01:12:37.537 --> 01:12:39.287
Goodbye.

01:12:39.435 --> 01:12:41.404
And thank-ye.

01:12:48.164 --> 01:12:51.375
And now for the last brook,
and to be a Queen.

01:12:51.462 --> 01:12:53.556
How grand it sounds!

01:12:53.730 --> 01:12:56.059
The eighth square at last.

01:13:14.325 --> 01:13:16.333
Well, it is grand.

01:13:16.951 --> 01:13:20.060
I never expected to be a Queen so soon.

01:13:20.341 --> 01:13:22.630
And I'll tell you what to do, Your Majesty.

01:13:22.717 --> 01:13:25.764
It'll never do for you
to be lolling about like that.

01:13:25.995 --> 01:13:28.412
Queens have to be dignified, you know?

01:13:29.131 --> 01:13:31.210
I really am a Queen.

01:13:40.370 --> 01:13:43.980
- Please, would you tell me...?
- Speak when you're spoken to.

01:13:44.473 --> 01:13:46.246
But, if everybody obeyed that rule,

01:13:46.294 --> 01:13:48.177
and if you only spoke
when you were spoken to,

01:13:48.202 --> 01:13:50.255
and you always waited for
the other person to begin,

01:13:50.277 --> 01:13:53.294
- then nobody would ever say anything.
- Ridiculous.

01:13:53.635 --> 01:13:55.862
What do you mean
if you were really a Queen?

01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:58.628
You can't be a Queen untill
you've passed the proper examination.

01:13:58.690 --> 01:14:01.815
And the sooner we begin it, the better.

01:14:02.652 --> 01:14:04.401
I only said "if".

01:14:04.667 --> 01:14:07.707
She says she only said "if".

01:14:07.809 --> 01:14:13.192
But, she said more than that.
Oh, ever so much more than that.

01:14:13.242 --> 01:14:15.703
So, you did, you know?

01:14:15.813 --> 01:14:17.507
Think before you speak.

01:14:17.532 --> 01:14:21.024
Always speak the truth
and write it down afterwards..

01:14:21.127 --> 01:14:24.775
- I'm sure, I didn't mean...
- That's just what I complain of.

01:14:24.814 --> 01:14:26.548
You should have mant.

01:14:26.717 --> 01:14:30.346
What do you suppose is the use
of the child without any meaning?

01:14:30.385 --> 01:14:32.619
Even a joke should have some meaning.

01:14:32.659 --> 01:14:35.339
And a child is more important
than a joke, I hope.

01:14:35.393 --> 01:14:38.495
You couldn't deny that,
even if you try with both hands.

01:14:38.564 --> 01:14:40.768
I don't deny things with my hands.

01:14:40.838 --> 01:14:43.354
No-one said you did.
I said you couldn't if you tried.

01:14:43.403 --> 01:14:48.244
She has it in her mind to deny something,
but, she doesn't know what to deny.

01:14:48.284 --> 01:14:51.167
A nasty, vicious temper.

01:14:55.066 --> 01:15:00.738
I invite you to Alice's dinner party,
this afternoon.

01:15:01.504 --> 01:15:04.902
And I invite you.

01:15:06.556 --> 01:15:09.721
I didn't know I was
to have a party at all. But,...

01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:12.674
if there is to be one,
I think I ought to invite the guests.

01:15:12.713 --> 01:15:16.127
We gave you the opportunity to do so.

01:15:16.401 --> 01:15:20.612
But, I daresay you haven't had
many lessons in manners yet.

01:15:23.066 --> 01:15:25.261
No!

01:15:25.683 --> 01:15:27.894
Manners are not taught in lessens.

01:15:28.277 --> 01:15:31.269
Lessons teach you to do sums,
and things of that sort.

01:15:31.730 --> 01:15:33.355
Can you do addition?

01:15:33.441 --> 01:15:36.949
What's 1 and 1 and 1
and 1 and 1 and 1 and 1?

01:15:37.089 --> 01:15:38.816
Well, I don't know.
I lost count.

01:15:38.863 --> 01:15:40.020
She can't do addition.

01:15:40.075 --> 01:15:42.380
Can you do subtraction?
Take 9 from 8.

01:15:42.516 --> 01:15:44.176
9 from 8?
That can't, you know?

01:15:44.215 --> 01:15:46.751
She can't do subtraction.
Can you do division?

01:15:46.896 --> 01:15:50.432
If you divide a loaf with a knife,
what's the answer?

01:15:50.612 --> 01:15:53.808
- I suppose...
- Bread and butter, of course.

01:15:53.901 --> 01:15:58.714
Try another subtraction sum.
Take a bone from a dog, what remains?

01:15:59.198 --> 01:16:02.737
Well, the bone wouldn't remain
if I'm taking it.

01:16:03.441 --> 01:16:06.621
And the dog wouldn't remain.
It would come after me.

01:16:06.670 --> 01:16:08.342
And I'm sure I shouldn't remain.

01:16:08.444 --> 01:16:11.780
So, you think nothing would remain?

01:16:11.866 --> 01:16:15.624
- Yes, I think that's the answer.
- Wrong as usual.

01:16:15.694 --> 01:16:18.015
The dog's temper would remain.

01:16:18.062 --> 01:16:19.069
I don't see how.

01:16:19.094 --> 01:16:21.913
 Look, the dog would lose its temper,
wouldn't it?

01:16:21.952 --> 01:16:22.968
Perhaps, it would.

01:16:22.993 --> 01:16:26.771
So, if the dog went away,
the temper would remain.

01:16:26.835 --> 01:16:28.991
They might go different way.

01:16:29.749 --> 01:16:33.312
She can't do sums a bit.

01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:37.428
Can you answer useful questions?

01:16:37.936 --> 01:16:39.897
How is bread made?

01:16:40.341 --> 01:16:44.005
- Well, you, you take some flour.
- Where do you pick the flour?

01:16:44.131 --> 01:16:46.771
You don't pick it at all.
It's ground.

01:16:46.951 --> 01:16:48.709
How many acres of ground?

01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:51.404
You mustn't miss out so many things.

01:16:51.490 --> 01:16:53.037
Fan her head.

01:16:53.130 --> 01:16:56.310
She'll be feverish after all that thinking.

01:16:56.357 --> 01:16:59.896
Do you know languages?
What's the French for "fiddle-de-dee"?

01:17:00.084 --> 01:17:03.162
- "Fiddle-de-dee" isn't English.
- Who ever said it was?

01:17:03.302 --> 01:17:05.677
If you can me
what language "fiddle-de-dee" is,

01:17:05.717 --> 01:17:07.076
I'll tell you the French for it.

01:17:07.117 --> 01:17:10.383
Queens never make bargain.

01:17:10.453 --> 01:17:12.860
I wish Queens never asked questions.

01:17:14.985 --> 01:17:18.712
I'm so sleepy.

01:17:19.564 --> 01:17:21.571
She's tired.

01:17:21.689 --> 01:17:25.345
Smooth her hair and
sing her a soothing lullaby.

01:17:25.485 --> 01:17:28.126
I don't know any soothing lullabies.

01:17:29.806 --> 01:17:35.634
Hush-a-by lady, in Alice's lap!

01:17:35.962 --> 01:17:40.696
Till the feast's ready,
we've time for a nap.

01:17:40.853 --> 01:17:44.603
When the feast's over,
we'll go to the ball.

01:17:44.725 --> 01:17:52.600
Red Queen, and White Queen,
and Alice, and all!

01:17:53.886 --> 01:17:56.582
Now that you heard the words,
sing it through to me.

01:17:56.637 --> 01:17:58.566
I'm a bit tired now.

01:18:01.347 --> 01:18:03.293
Hush...

01:18:08.511 --> 01:18:10.206
Hush...

01:18:20.956 --> 01:18:24.575
[ QUEEN ALICE ]

01:18:32.052 --> 01:18:34.626
[ VISITORS BELL ]
[ SERVANTS BELL ]

01:18:34.787 --> 01:18:36.756
I am not a visitor,...

01:18:36.951 --> 01:18:39.029
and I'm not a servant.

01:18:39.287 --> 01:18:41.241
There ought to be one marked "Queen".

01:18:41.311 --> 01:18:43.616
No admittance till the week after next.

01:18:50.043 --> 01:18:51.457
What is it now?

01:18:51.488 --> 01:18:54.207
Where is the servant whose business
it is to answer the door?

01:18:54.308 --> 01:18:56.762
- Which door?
- This one, of course.

01:18:56.808 --> 01:18:59.520
- What's it been asking of?
- I don't know what you mean.

01:18:59.585 --> 01:19:01.984
I speak English, don't I?
Or are you deaf?

01:19:02.031 --> 01:19:03.648
- What did it ask you?
- Nothing.

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:05.448
- I knocked at it.
- Shouldn't do that.

01:19:05.511 --> 01:19:07.605
Shouldn't do that.
It wexes it, you know?

01:19:07.664 --> 01:19:10.354
You let it alone,
and it'll let you alone.

01:20:45.529 --> 01:20:48.146
You've missed the soup and the fish.

01:20:48.233 --> 01:20:50.077
Bring on the joint.

01:20:59.704 --> 01:21:00.947
You look a little shy.

01:21:01.017 --> 01:21:03.337
Let me introduce you to this leg of lamb.

01:21:03.408 --> 01:21:05.673
Alice, Mutton.
Mutton, Alice.

01:21:09.409 --> 01:21:12.079
- May I cut you a slice?
- Certainly not.

01:21:12.266 --> 01:21:15.485
It isn't etiquette to cut anuone
you've been introduced to.

01:21:15.524 --> 01:21:17.555
Remove the joint.

01:21:24.023 --> 01:21:27.172
I won't be introduced to the pudding,
please, or we shall get no dinner at all.

01:21:27.203 --> 01:21:30.539
Pudding, Alice. Alice, pudding.
Remove the pudding.

01:21:31.308 --> 01:21:33.550
Waiter, bring back the pudding.

01:21:38.795 --> 01:21:40.186
What impertinence!

01:21:40.264 --> 01:21:42.819
How would you like it
if I were to cut a slice out of you?

01:21:42.909 --> 01:21:44.303
Make a remark.

01:21:44.381 --> 01:21:48.108
It's ridiculous to leave all
the conversation to the pudding.

01:21:53.551 --> 01:21:58.317
You know, I've had such a quantity
of poetry repeated to me today. And...

01:21:58.543 --> 01:22:00.442
it's a curious thing,

01:22:00.637 --> 01:22:02.418
all of it seems to be...

01:22:02.544 --> 01:22:04.982
about fishes in some way.

01:22:12.444 --> 01:22:16.999
- Queen Alice's health.
- Queen Alice's health.

01:22:28.628 --> 01:22:32.087
You can return thanks
by making a neat speech.

01:22:33.355 --> 01:22:35.290
We must support her.

01:22:37.281 --> 01:22:40.313
- I rise to...
- Take care of yourself.

01:22:40.554 --> 01:22:42.835
Something is going to happen.

01:23:02.212 --> 01:23:04.460
Or a bee?

01:23:06.586 --> 01:23:07.922
Ooh!

01:23:13.652 --> 01:23:16.431
I can not stand this any longer.

01:23:19.269 --> 01:23:21.129
Mom...

01:23:28.144 --> 01:23:30.390
I'm sorry, darling.

01:23:31.307 --> 01:23:33.968
So, we'll read some more tomorrow night.

01:23:34.055 --> 01:23:35.211
Okay.

01:23:35.244 --> 01:23:37.143
Huh, Mr. Walrus.

01:23:37.456 --> 01:23:38.917
How are you?

01:23:47.970 --> 01:23:50.532
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

01:23:52.645 --> 01:23:55.028
That's not a memorandum of your feelings.

01:23:55.059 --> 01:23:56.154
It's the end of my move.

01:23:56.208 --> 01:23:58.615
All feasting and fun.

01:24:01.145 --> 01:24:03.091
Goodnight, Humpty.

01:24:38.802 --> 01:24:41.162
A BOAT beneath a sunny sky,

01:24:41.349 --> 01:24:43.459
Lingering onward dreamily

01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:46.158
In an evening of July.

01:24:46.472 --> 01:24:49.170
Children three that nestle near,

01:24:49.558 --> 01:24:52.089
Eager eye and willing ear,

01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:54.988
Pleased a simple tale to hear.

01:24:55.470 --> 01:24:57.843
Long has paled that sunny sky:

01:24:57.962 --> 01:25:00.457
Echoes fade and memories die:

01:25:00.762 --> 01:25:03.653
Autumn frosts have slain July.

01:25:04.122 --> 01:25:07.333
Still she haunts me, phantomwise,

01:25:07.591 --> 01:25:09.875
Alice moving under skies

01:25:10.008 --> 01:25:12.591
Never seen by waking eyes.

01:25:12.786 --> 01:25:15.239
Children yet, the tale to hear,

01:25:15.456 --> 01:25:17.699
Eager eye and willing ear,

01:25:17.837 --> 01:25:20.127
Lovingly shall nestle near.

01:25:20.262 --> 01:25:21.981
In a Wonderland they lie,

01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:24.239
Dreaming as the days go by,

01:25:24.583 --> 01:25:27.020
Dreaming as the summers die:

01:25:27.342 --> 01:25:29.575
Ever drifting down the stream.

01:25:29.747 --> 01:25:32.203
Lingering in the golden gleam.

01:25:32.551 --> 01:25:36.223
Life, what is it but a dream?
