WEBVTT

00:01.073 --> 00:03.522
Okay, uh, Jay,
I'm putting you in Grocery.

00:03.522 --> 00:05.576
Sandra, we haven't even started
the Cosmetics reset,

00:05.578 --> 00:06.577
so can you get on that?

00:06.579 --> 00:08.012
- Got it.
- Okay, Carol...

00:08.013 --> 00:09.614
I'm moving you off the register,

00:09.616 --> 00:11.082
and, Cheyenne, I need you in Jewelry.

00:11.084 --> 00:13.554
What? Then no one's
covering Housewares.

00:13.554 --> 00:15.253
I mean, if somebody finds a way

00:15.255 --> 00:17.321
to shoplift a couch,
then they deserve it.

00:17.323 --> 00:20.168
I get that that's a joke,
but in all seriousness, guys,

00:20.168 --> 00:21.927
if you do see someone taking a couch,

00:21.928 --> 00:23.528
walkie oh-three-five.

00:23.530 --> 00:25.363
See something, say something.

00:25.365 --> 00:28.893
And, also, corporate is
asking us to cut hours again.

00:30.294 --> 00:32.703
Yes, I know. I agree. It sucks.

00:32.705 --> 00:35.122
We can barely keep up with
everything there is to do now.

00:35.123 --> 00:35.981
Yeah, it already looks

00:35.982 --> 00:38.609
like the day after
the Fyre Festival in here.

00:38.611 --> 00:40.344
I said the exact same thing yesterday.

00:40.346 --> 00:42.446
Oh, did you really? 'Cause I
wasn't in Grocery at the time,

00:42.448 --> 00:43.548
so I couldn't have heard you.

00:43.550 --> 00:44.703
Yeah, this place is a mess.

00:44.703 --> 00:46.450
Did you guys see this picture
somebody tweeted?

00:46.452 --> 00:48.352
It's just a bunch of beef
in a shopping cart.

00:48.354 --> 00:49.954
- What?
- "Less Meat, More Filling."

00:49.956 --> 00:51.956
- What does that even mean?
- It's a pun.

00:51.958 --> 00:53.991
Remember that commercial...
"Tastes Great, Less Filling"?

00:53.993 --> 00:56.534
- In what world is that a pun?
- I get it.

00:56.534 --> 00:58.345
That picture could be from any Cloud 9.

00:58.346 --> 01:00.202
No, I think it was ours.

01:03.412 --> 01:04.997
Can somebody please take care of that?

01:04.997 --> 01:07.343
Dibs! Yes.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:21.654 --> 01:23.521
What do we think happened here?

01:23.523 --> 01:24.302
Overdose?

01:24.303 --> 01:25.803
Ah, Bob didn't even drink.

01:26.192 --> 01:28.092
His wife's been flirting
with that tennis pro

01:28.094 --> 01:30.345
over in Fitness with the
big arms and no head.

01:30.345 --> 01:31.395
I'd start there.

01:31.397 --> 01:33.497
I swear, it's like every time
we solve one problem,

01:33.499 --> 01:34.409
another one pops up.

01:34.410 --> 01:36.167
I feel like I'm playing Whac-A-Mole.

01:36.169 --> 01:38.035
That can't still be a game, can it?

01:38.037 --> 01:40.671
With the hitting animals? Never mind.

01:40.673 --> 01:42.840
We're just too understaffed.

01:42.842 --> 01:44.875
Yeah. No, I-I know.
I keep telling corporate,

01:44.877 --> 01:46.344
but they just don't believe me.

01:46.346 --> 01:48.179
Yeah, because every
time they cut hours,

01:48.181 --> 01:50.214
we push ourselves even
harder to make it work,

01:50.216 --> 01:52.516
which they think just proves
we never needed the hours

01:52.518 --> 01:54.585
to begin with, and so they just
keep cutting and cutting

01:54.587 --> 01:56.621
until something like this happens.

01:57.259 --> 01:58.356
Poor guy.

01:58.945 --> 02:01.292
- He had kids.
- He had kids?

02:01.294 --> 02:03.127
Yeah. They've been playing soccer

02:03.129 --> 02:05.563
over in Toys and Games
for the last three months.

02:05.565 --> 02:07.098
I don't know what I'm gonna do

02:07.100 --> 02:09.213
if they keep cutting
back our hours. I got bills!

02:09.214 --> 02:11.435
I saw this methadone study
that pays pretty well,

02:11.437 --> 02:13.971
but they said I'd have to
get addicted to heroin first.

02:13.973 --> 02:15.239
So that's another expense.

02:15.241 --> 02:16.907
I was thinking of being a surrogate

02:16.909 --> 02:19.162
I mean, my womb is just
sitting here empty.

02:19.163 --> 02:20.458
Ooh, highly recommend!

02:20.459 --> 02:22.880
The money's good and your
nipples get super sensitive.

02:22.882 --> 02:24.215
I guess I'm gonna have
to have a garage sale

02:24.217 --> 02:24.949
or something.

02:25.345 --> 02:26.665
I don't have anything to sell.

02:26.666 --> 02:28.919
You have, like, 83 pairs of
sneakers, and you can't walk.

02:28.921 --> 02:30.454
Yeah? You got a bunch of hats.

02:30.456 --> 02:31.922
You don't bounce around
on your head all day.

02:31.924 --> 02:33.291
Ah, fair enough.

02:33.293 --> 02:34.678
Well, no one will even hire you

02:34.679 --> 02:36.158
if you're on call here all the time.

02:36.159 --> 02:37.928
That's why I didn't get that
job as a shirtless greeter

02:37.930 --> 02:39.282
at Abercrombie & Fitch.

02:39.283 --> 02:41.703
Oh, I used to have that job,
but in a guy's house.

02:42.402 --> 02:44.747
I knew him. He was my wrestling coach.

02:56.582 --> 02:59.116
Hey, Carol, can you cover
Sporting Goods for me?

02:59.118 --> 03:01.986
'Cause there's been a gigantic
honey spill in Groceries.

03:01.988 --> 03:05.189
It's the hardest of all spills,
so this is where I shine.

03:06.459 --> 03:07.416
Uh-huh.

03:08.594 --> 03:10.828
Hey, something bothering you?

03:10.830 --> 03:13.707
If there is, you can talk
to me about anything.

03:14.970 --> 03:15.966
Well...

03:15.968 --> 03:18.794
Sandra's a whore
who's [bleep] my boyfriend.

03:19.939 --> 03:22.807
Okay, well... Wow. Uh...

03:22.809 --> 03:25.810
She doesn't know that I know,
but that's the way I like it.

03:26.450 --> 03:29.279
You can really hurt someone
when they don't see it coming.

03:29.282 --> 03:32.516
Well, sounds like you've pretty
much got that under control.

03:32.518 --> 03:35.820
It's so good to finally have
someone to talk to about this.

03:36.582 --> 03:37.288
Yeah.

03:37.290 --> 03:39.957
We have a real father-daughter
relationship.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.326
Thank you, Daddy.

03:43.262 --> 03:44.395
You're welcome.

03:44.397 --> 03:46.678
No, no. Do the Daddy voice.

03:47.734 --> 03:49.753
You're welcome, Honey Bear.

03:51.243 --> 03:53.471
How much do you think
I could get for this?

03:53.473 --> 03:55.973
Oh, no, you're selling that?
It's so gorgeous.

03:55.975 --> 03:57.575
I know, but I need the money.

03:57.577 --> 03:59.143
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

03:59.145 --> 04:01.312
I was being so sarcastic there,
it came off as sincere.

04:01.314 --> 04:03.514
It's hideous. Maybe two dollars?

04:03.516 --> 04:06.817
Maybe there's no
point in having a garage sale.

04:06.819 --> 04:08.652
Well, why can't you just
find another way to make money?

04:08.654 --> 04:10.654
Well, I thought about doing a webcam,

04:10.656 --> 04:12.256
but then Bo said no.

04:12.258 --> 04:14.862
And it's like, why does
he get to do one and I don't?

04:14.863 --> 04:16.478
Excuse me. How much is this?

04:17.096 --> 04:19.497
- You... want to buy that?
- Yeah.

04:19.499 --> 04:21.999
It's $59.99. Yeah,
they're selling like crazy.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.996
- That's the last one.
- Okay.

04:25.004 --> 04:26.901
Great! I can ring you up here.

04:27.540 --> 04:29.407
Oh, there might be
some old birth control pills

04:29.409 --> 04:31.776
in the side pocket there,
but you can keep those.

04:32.045 --> 04:34.768
So we are really concerned
about this Twitter photo

04:34.768 --> 04:36.570
of a shopping cart
of steaks in your store.

04:36.570 --> 04:37.200
Uh-huh.

04:37.201 --> 04:38.959
It's a big warning sign for us.

04:38.960 --> 04:40.722
Yeah, uh, I-I know that it looked bad,

04:40.723 --> 04:42.586
but... but we threw the steaks out,

04:42.588 --> 04:45.456
and the big honey spill
is... is taken care of.

04:45.458 --> 04:47.289
- The what?
- The big...

04:48.027 --> 04:49.860
Huh? What?

04:49.862 --> 04:52.163
Look, are you having trouble
handling things over there?

04:52.164 --> 04:54.780
No. No, I-I-I got it handled.

04:54.780 --> 04:55.471
It's handled.

04:55.472 --> 04:58.175
So you don't think you
need more hours, then?

04:58.176 --> 05:02.473
Are... you're... you're offering
to give me more hours?

05:02.822 --> 05:06.544
I, uh... I didn't... I didn't
realize that was an option.

05:06.954 --> 05:08.620
Of course. I mean, if you need them.

05:08.622 --> 05:10.188
But if you're sure you can handle it

05:10.189 --> 05:11.140
with just the hours you have...

05:11.141 --> 05:12.482
No, I'll take the hours.

05:12.906 --> 05:13.740
I mean...

05:15.135 --> 05:18.023
Um, maybe. Yeah, we could...

05:18.692 --> 05:20.792
Or not. I mean, yes, definite...

05:20.901 --> 05:22.826
Yeah, definitely, we'll take the hours.

05:30.803 --> 05:32.228
I've been asking corporate for weeks

05:32.229 --> 05:33.734
to give me more hours, and nothing!

05:33.735 --> 05:35.436
And then one embarrassing
photo comes out,

05:35.437 --> 05:36.758
and they're like, "Here you go!"

05:36.759 --> 05:39.170
See? I told you. They just
needed to see that things

05:39.171 --> 05:41.252
would fall apart
if they didn't step in.

05:41.253 --> 05:42.313
You were totally right.

05:42.314 --> 05:43.666
It was my need to be perfect

05:43.667 --> 05:44.854
that was screwing everything up.

05:44.855 --> 05:47.222
You know, it's crazy
how many of your problems

05:47.223 --> 05:49.995
- stem from your own excellence
- I know.

05:49.997 --> 05:51.878
We should start encouraging customers

05:51.879 --> 05:53.710
to keep tweeting bad things about us.

05:53.711 --> 05:55.037
Yeah, w-why stop there?

05:55.038 --> 05:56.104
I mean, we should just create a bunch

05:56.105 --> 05:58.013
of fake Twitter accounts
and tweet it ourselves.

05:58.014 --> 05:59.717
Ha ha. We should totally do that.

06:01.075 --> 06:02.197
We totally should.

06:03.149 --> 06:05.406
No, we should actually do that.

06:06.005 --> 06:07.733
Yeah, I-I thought
I was communicating that

06:07.734 --> 06:09.692
with my eyes,
but, yeah, yeah, same page.

06:11.595 --> 06:13.161
Just make sure you get the whole...

06:13.162 --> 06:15.999
No, I got it, I've got it.
Okay, and what should it say?

06:16.386 --> 06:20.451
Um, okay, how about
"Cleanup on Aisle Yuck"?

06:20.897 --> 06:24.341
Eh, I just don't feel like
that's MayaJade91's voice.

06:24.342 --> 06:27.055
"MayaJade91"? What happened
to "Steelersfan211"?

06:27.056 --> 06:28.123
Steelersfan is the one who tweeted

06:28.124 --> 06:29.521
about how gross the bathrooms were.

06:29.522 --> 06:30.834
MayaJade's a little more spiritual,

06:30.835 --> 06:32.485
more in touch with vibrations

06:32.486 --> 06:34.968
and just kind of, like,
the energy surrounding things.

06:34.969 --> 06:37.031
Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay, how about...

06:37.917 --> 06:40.482
"Don't let this chaos
dim your inner light,

06:40.483 --> 06:44.495
♪ Cloud9Fail, ♪ BadDayToWearSandals"?

06:44.496 --> 06:46.813
Wow. You are really,
really good at this.

06:46.814 --> 06:49.018
It's like a one-line
character portrait.

06:49.311 --> 06:52.801
Oh, Amy? Someone left
half a cat in Electronics.

06:52.802 --> 06:53.864
Half a dead cat?

06:53.865 --> 06:56.164
- Well, no.
- That's perfect.

06:56.165 --> 06:58.047
I can't believe this just
fell into our lap.

06:58.547 --> 06:59.907
It's the butt half!

07:01.794 --> 07:04.573
Ooh, what about this
promotional Sinex visor?

07:04.574 --> 07:05.832
Ugh, that was Jeff's.

07:05.833 --> 07:07.835
He said he wore it ironically, but...

07:07.836 --> 07:09.637
So you guys are just selling
your old crap in the store?

07:09.638 --> 07:12.617
Vintage. We're selling our
vintage crap in the store.

07:12.618 --> 07:14.684
I got one guy to buy an old bra of mine

07:14.685 --> 07:16.417
just by saying it touched my boobs.

07:16.418 --> 07:18.880
Wow. It's all in the marketing, huh?

07:18.881 --> 07:21.434
We set up a special bar code,
so anything scanned

07:21.435 --> 07:23.432
gets sent straight
to our Venmo account.

07:23.433 --> 07:25.688
@chateo$biz.

07:25.689 --> 07:27.263
We've already made over $200.

07:27.264 --> 07:28.176
Seriously?

07:28.576 --> 07:30.770
Maybe I should try selling
some of my sneakers.

07:31.796 --> 07:33.414
I feel like the casino guy.

07:33.415 --> 07:34.575
You're broke.

07:44.029 --> 07:47.407
"Just a normal day
in America, # Cloud9Fail."

07:47.408 --> 07:49.862
- Unbelievable.
- What's going on here?

07:49.863 --> 07:52.113
Uh, more people are posting
photos of the store.

07:52.114 --> 07:53.686
- You're kidding me.
- This store?

07:53.687 --> 07:56.858
"Cloud 9 is looking
a little bit cattywampus"?

07:56.859 --> 07:58.300
What does "cattywampus" mean?

07:58.301 --> 08:00.754
Uh, cattywampus is, I believe,

08:00.755 --> 08:03.447
regional slang
for, uh, like, "all messed up."

08:03.448 --> 08:05.744
You know, I think the...
they use it in Arkansas.

08:05.917 --> 08:08.885
Oh, yep, there you go right
there... petiteroche22,

08:08.887 --> 08:11.454
that... that just... that means
"Little Rock" in French.

08:11.455 --> 08:12.074
Whoa.

08:12.075 --> 08:13.897
These just keep going and going.

08:13.898 --> 08:16.032
This is why we shouldn't
let customers into the store.

08:16.033 --> 08:19.002
- Wow, bummer.
- "Wow, bummer"?

08:19.431 --> 08:22.198
People are tearing us apart,
and your reaction is,

08:22.200 --> 08:23.967
"Wow, bummer"?

08:23.969 --> 08:25.147
No. No.

08:25.148 --> 08:29.072
No, I-I meant that like...
like, "Wow! That's a bummer!"

08:29.074 --> 08:32.033
Like, what the hell?
I'm up to here with this crap!"

08:32.034 --> 08:33.845
You know, like, "[bleep] these people!"

08:34.424 --> 08:35.394
Ugh!

08:39.544 --> 08:42.395
That is how people act
when they're upset.

08:43.047 --> 08:46.716
Oh, man. Petiteroche22 is gonna
rip our asses for this one.

08:48.673 --> 08:50.673
If you're looking
for an electric toothbrush,

08:50.675 --> 08:53.576
I'd suggest the Dentafix 100.

08:53.938 --> 08:55.058
It looks used.

08:55.405 --> 08:57.874
What? Who would sell a used toothbrush?

08:57.875 --> 08:59.104
We wouldn't sell that.

08:59.105 --> 09:01.479
This is the newest trend
in oral hygiene.

09:01.480 --> 09:03.274
You want a brush that's pre-distressed,

09:03.275 --> 09:04.458
like a nice pair of jeans.

09:04.459 --> 09:06.708
A friend of mine got one
of the old models

09:06.709 --> 09:08.809
with the straight, white bristles.

09:09.197 --> 09:10.508
Tore her gums to shreds.

09:10.509 --> 09:12.689
She had to get new ones
from a dead body.

09:14.519 --> 09:18.557
You have 83 pairs of shoes
and none of them light up?

09:18.558 --> 09:20.289
No, but some of them
are pretty valuable.

09:20.291 --> 09:21.791
Well, yeah. No, I bet.

09:21.793 --> 09:23.960
Excuse me, um, what could you tell me

09:23.962 --> 09:25.143
about these white Reeboks?

09:25.144 --> 09:27.981
Oh, yeah, those are
the OG 1989 Reebok Pumps.

09:28.299 --> 09:30.984
Classic white-and-blue colorway
with the mesh tongue.

09:30.985 --> 09:33.803
I even got the original box
and the Pump hang tag.

09:33.805 --> 09:35.758
I have flat feet.
How's the arch support?

09:36.581 --> 09:39.062
Those are original Reebok Pumps.

09:39.717 --> 09:42.906
When you buy a painting, do you
ask how the arch support is?

09:43.815 --> 09:45.928
I'm just looking for
something I can go hiking in.

09:45.929 --> 09:48.358
- Please leave.
- What? No, I was just asking...

09:48.359 --> 09:49.943
Sir, he asked you to leave.

09:51.923 --> 09:53.956
So we've been noticing a lot more

09:53.958 --> 09:56.003
of these "Cloud9Fail" photos
on Twitter.

09:56.004 --> 10:00.120
Yeah, um, you know, we are
trying our best over here,

10:00.121 --> 10:02.577
but we just keep coming up short.

10:02.578 --> 10:04.509
We really need to take care of this.

10:04.822 --> 10:08.558
I agree, but I am just
all out of ideas.

10:08.707 --> 10:11.698
If you want to suggest anything...

10:11.699 --> 10:13.643
You know, I'm just
thinking out loud here,

10:13.645 --> 10:15.484
and I hate to even have
to bring this up,

10:15.485 --> 10:17.711
but I kind of feel like
if you guys give us back

10:17.712 --> 10:20.750
a few more hours,
we could nip this thing

10:20.752 --> 10:22.121
in the bud once and for all.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.723
Well, actually, we think
all of the tweets

10:23.724 --> 10:25.424
have come from an employee
at your store.

10:25.431 --> 10:25.795
Huh?

10:30.115 --> 10:32.306
Hi, my name is Luanne.
I'm from Human Resources.

10:32.445 --> 10:34.033
Than the one next door.
I'm here because an employee

10:34.101 --> 10:36.301
has been tweeting
defamatory photos of the store

10:36.303 --> 10:37.694
from fake accounts,

10:37.695 --> 10:38.955
and I'm here to find out who it is

10:38.956 --> 10:41.275
and to hold them responsible.
So who was it?

10:41.775 --> 10:43.808
If you just stand up and come
clean about what you did,

10:43.810 --> 10:46.131
I promise nothing will happen to you.

10:46.574 --> 10:48.138
Well, we will have to fire them.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.982
I know, but don't say it.
We almost had them.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.037
No, we didn't.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.251
Okay, well, in the future,

10:53.253 --> 10:55.353
if you could just follow
my lead, please. Thank you.

10:55.355 --> 10:56.688
Excuse me?

10:56.690 --> 10:58.256
How do you know it's one of us?

10:58.258 --> 11:00.792
Well, all the posts came
from the same MAC address,

11:00.794 --> 11:03.502
and that device was logged
into the employee WiFi network.

11:03.503 --> 11:06.030
Who would be dumb enough
to send incriminating tweets

11:06.032 --> 11:07.524
from the employee WiFi?

11:07.525 --> 11:10.493
Well, it wasn't me, because
my phone is on airplane mode,

11:10.494 --> 11:12.370
and I do not know how to get it off.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.472
They were so obvious about it, too.

11:14.474 --> 11:17.609
All the fake customer accounts
were created on the same day,

11:17.611 --> 11:19.576
and they each only tweeted once.

11:19.577 --> 11:21.379
- What a dumb-ass.
- Oh, my God.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.014
- Stupid.
- Seriously. Idiot.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.049
All right, well, I don't know
how productive it is

11:25.051 --> 11:28.619
to dwell on how stupid
this person may or may not be.

11:28.620 --> 11:33.001
I think the point is,
whoever did it, knock it off.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.175
You have been warned.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.661
- That's fair.
- Okay, well, thank you

11:36.730 --> 11:38.092
so much for coming by, Luanne.

11:38.093 --> 11:40.288
Sure, but I'm not leaving
until we figure this out.

11:40.633 --> 11:42.066
Oh, good.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.335
All right, everyone,
you're all gonna have

11:44.337 --> 11:45.403
to hand over your phones.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.972
No, we cannot take your devices.

11:47.974 --> 11:50.490
Luanne! Are you serious right now?

11:59.719 --> 12:01.252
What are we gonna do? We need a plan.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.662
We should have never done this.

12:02.663 --> 12:04.589
Or at least we should've
used a burner phone.

12:04.591 --> 12:06.090
Yeah, great. That's...
Good... good plan.

12:06.092 --> 12:06.870
That's really helpful.

12:06.871 --> 12:09.060
Okay, well, then what's your plan?

12:09.062 --> 12:11.429
Well, for starters,
neither of us can admit

12:11.431 --> 12:12.300
to sending the tweets.

12:12.301 --> 12:14.599
Oh, well, that... that's good.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.375
Hold on while I write that down.

12:16.376 --> 12:19.170
"Don't admit to crime."

12:19.172 --> 12:22.774
Look, if for whatever reason
it gets traced back to me,

12:22.776 --> 12:24.442
I'm gonna say that I acted alone.

12:24.444 --> 12:27.445
There's no reason that both
of us should lose our jobs.

12:27.447 --> 12:28.699
Oh, okay.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.783
That was...

12:31.785 --> 12:34.018
that was just kind of,
like, a big gesture,

12:34.020 --> 12:37.021
so I thought maybe
I'd... I'd get a bigger reaction.

12:37.023 --> 12:38.089
Yeah. No...

12:38.091 --> 12:40.451
Yeah. No. Yes, of course. Thank you.

12:40.927 --> 12:44.369
But I just... I kind of figured
that's what we would do.

12:44.457 --> 12:44.896
Right.

12:44.997 --> 12:46.936
Just based on what we both make.

12:46.937 --> 12:48.780
- And I have kids.
- Yeah.

12:48.827 --> 12:49.736
It just sort of makes the most sense.

12:49.737 --> 12:53.363
- But that was a very nice offer.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:53.365 --> 12:55.115
Let's just... let's just move on, so...

12:55.462 --> 12:57.336
You know, I just want to make
sure that you're not planning

12:57.337 --> 13:00.053
on doing any hiking or grape stomping

13:00.072 --> 13:01.997
- or anything like that in these?
- Uh, no.

13:01.999 --> 13:03.985
No, you think I'd go hiking
in a pair of shoes

13:03.986 --> 13:06.399
I've been trying to find
for, like, six years?

13:06.400 --> 13:08.183
Of course. I'm just messing with you.

13:08.184 --> 13:11.249
All right. So, uh...

13:11.250 --> 13:13.148
You know what? Do you need these today?

13:13.149 --> 13:14.626
Because I could give them
to you next week

13:14.627 --> 13:16.461
and bring them home,
clean them up, make them nice.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.408
No, that's cool. These are pristine.

13:18.409 --> 13:19.564
Yep, they are.

13:20.632 --> 13:21.586
They are pristine.

13:21.883 --> 13:24.049
Okay, so...

13:24.050 --> 13:25.646
You're going to give me the money,

13:25.647 --> 13:27.445
I'm going to give you the shoes,

13:27.446 --> 13:30.094
and they will be yours and not mine.

13:30.456 --> 13:32.267
That is generally how this works.

13:32.268 --> 13:33.873
Right, right.

13:33.874 --> 13:35.492
Great. How much do I owe you?

13:37.282 --> 13:38.525
$3 million.

13:41.501 --> 13:44.443
Okay, so the first tweet
was sent at 10:46:32.

13:44.444 --> 13:46.113
Can we see if anyone was
on their phone then?

13:46.114 --> 13:46.987
Got it.

13:46.988 --> 13:49.881
Okay, looks like Brett
was on his phone.

13:50.628 --> 13:51.740
Also Jay.

13:52.393 --> 13:56.239
And, uh, Henry, Chris, Giuseppe W.,

13:56.601 --> 13:58.378
Sarah, Sue,

13:58.864 --> 14:02.211
Pablo, Denise, Giuseppe.

14:02.212 --> 14:03.931
Uh, okay, who was not texting?

14:03.932 --> 14:05.926
Uh, Elias isn't on his phone,

14:05.927 --> 14:07.540
though I think he might be asleep.

14:08.073 --> 14:10.021
- Uh, may I?
- Oh.

14:10.372 --> 14:12.355
What about the break room?
Anybody in there?

14:12.356 --> 14:14.167
Oh, yeah, no,
none of this is from today.

14:14.168 --> 14:15.670
We used to have cameras
in the break room,

14:15.671 --> 14:18.220
but then people found out
and got all rights-y about it.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.985
Wait... wait, hold on. What is that?

14:22.788 --> 14:25.855
Careful, careful,
stupid birds, dumb birds...

14:25.857 --> 14:28.291
Nice job.

14:30.729 --> 14:32.262
- No.
- Oh, oh, oh.

14:32.264 --> 14:34.130
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, no.

14:34.132 --> 14:36.499
Oh, no. Nope.

14:37.603 --> 14:40.176
Luanne, if you'll excuse me,

14:41.319 --> 14:43.105
I have some business to take care of.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.553
What is all this stuff?

14:45.554 --> 14:47.858
Well, it's just junk
we've had in our attic

14:47.859 --> 14:50.048
that we've been meaning
to throw out, you know.

14:50.049 --> 14:51.664
Jerusha's dad was a collector...

14:52.393 --> 14:55.440
of both things and, as it
turned out later, wives.

14:55.956 --> 14:57.683
But, anyway, is any of it valuable?

14:58.390 --> 15:02.004
I mean, a flattened
penny from Niagara Falls...

15:02.005 --> 15:03.499
that's worth less than a penny.

15:03.500 --> 15:06.356
Some random keys. Ka-ching!

15:07.173 --> 15:10.729
- A Neil Diamond cassette tape?
- Oh, I'll keep that.

15:10.730 --> 15:12.790
I've been meaning to check him out.

15:12.791 --> 15:14.616
What about these baseball cards?

15:14.617 --> 15:16.780
Mickey Mantle... wasn't he someone?

15:16.781 --> 15:19.497
I don't know. I've never really
been a fan of men's baseball.

15:19.730 --> 15:21.522
This is from the first
year he ever played,

15:21.523 --> 15:23.244
like, before he was even famous.

15:23.930 --> 15:25.098
Oh, it was worth a shot.

15:26.420 --> 15:29.518
Action Comics "Superman," 1938.

15:29.519 --> 15:31.413
Wow, this is so old.

15:33.251 --> 15:34.986
That doesn't even look like Dean Cain.

15:35.026 --> 15:35.767
Yeah.

15:36.486 --> 15:39.249
I had IT look up the
Websites that were visited

15:39.250 --> 15:41.451
by the same device
that posted the tweets.

15:41.452 --> 15:44.801
O... kay, so that's something
one could do.

15:44.803 --> 15:45.720
I didn't... didn't know that.

15:45.721 --> 15:48.806
So I was hoping we could
narrow down who it might be.

15:48.807 --> 15:51.411
Do you know anyone here
who would have visited, uh,

15:51.412 --> 15:53.287
"Huffington Post," "Slate,"

15:53.288 --> 15:54.664
"The New Yorker" caption contest,

15:54.665 --> 15:57.274
or done Google searches
for "brine my own pickles,"

15:57.275 --> 16:00.223
"Chris Hayes no glasses,"
and "Ronan Farrow age"?

16:00.585 --> 16:04.120
Huh, well, you know,
that really could describe

16:04.190 --> 16:06.015
just about everyone who works here.

16:06.016 --> 16:07.849
- It's a... it's a hip group.
- Excuse me.

16:08.282 --> 16:09.442
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

16:10.282 --> 16:13.067
If I know who the person is
who was tweeting,

16:13.683 --> 16:15.048
who should I tell about that?

16:15.049 --> 16:18.301
- You... are you saying you do?
- When you say "you"...

16:18.303 --> 16:18.969
Excuse me. Who is it?

16:18.970 --> 16:21.310
Her name is Sandra Kaluiokalani.

16:21.819 --> 16:23.751
That's spelled K-A-L...

16:24.883 --> 16:26.883
K... It's K-A-L...

16:28.221 --> 16:31.589
K-A-L-A, then I think it's "O."

16:31.723 --> 16:34.023
It's, um... it's K-A-L...

16:34.059 --> 16:35.492
Kalui...

16:36.012 --> 16:40.482
O-K-L-A-N-A-N-I.

16:40.484 --> 16:42.484
- Kaluiokalani.
- Okay.

16:42.486 --> 16:44.253
So how do you know that it's Sandra?

16:44.255 --> 16:45.354
Oh, she told me.

16:45.889 --> 16:47.258
We're really good friends,

16:47.258 --> 16:49.091
so we tell each other everything.

16:49.093 --> 16:52.461
No kidding, that's... I didn't
realize you two were so close.

16:52.463 --> 16:55.430
Oh, God, maybe
I shouldn't have said anything.

16:55.819 --> 16:58.020
I'm a horrible person, aren't I?

16:58.022 --> 16:59.021
No, you're not.

16:59.023 --> 17:01.211
She's not gonna be
in too much trouble, is she?

17:01.523 --> 17:04.540
I can't believe Sandra
would do something like that.

17:04.540 --> 17:06.184
I didn't think she had it in her.

17:06.185 --> 17:08.163
I borrowed her car, like,
three years ago,

17:08.165 --> 17:10.199
and she still hasn't asked for it back.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.415
Well, I'm not surprised.

17:11.416 --> 17:13.534
Cloud 9's been
dicking her over for years.

17:13.535 --> 17:15.671
It's true... she got injured on the job

17:15.673 --> 17:16.780
when she first started working.

17:16.781 --> 17:18.205
Instead of paying her medical bills,

17:18.207 --> 17:20.531
they just gave her a blue polo.

17:20.531 --> 17:22.569
- I guess she just snapped.
- I'm glad she did it.

17:22.570 --> 17:24.883
Like, it's about time one of us
stood up to corporate.

17:24.915 --> 17:25.617
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:25.618 --> 17:28.223
You know, as a store manager,
I would've been upset,

17:28.224 --> 17:30.828
but as a floor worker,
I'm like, "Get it, girl!"

17:30.829 --> 17:31.849
She's like a rebel.

17:31.850 --> 17:33.729
She's like a total badass bitch.

17:33.730 --> 17:35.636
Oh, my God, is Sandra an icon now?

17:35.637 --> 17:37.098
She's like a total badass bitch.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.739
Heard it both times, thanks.

17:41.243 --> 17:43.799
Sandra does live really far away.

17:43.801 --> 17:47.167
Maybe she'd be really happy to have
to find a new job closer to home.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.302
Yeah, I mean, a lot
of great success stories

17:49.303 --> 17:51.560
start with someone losing
their dead-end job.

17:51.561 --> 17:53.430
And perhaps she's supposed
to save the world,

17:53.431 --> 17:55.799
and us keeping her here
is just preventing that.

17:58.717 --> 18:01.936
Okay, I'm gonna go in there
and come clean.

18:01.937 --> 18:04.524
No, I'm not gonna
let you do that alone.

18:04.525 --> 18:05.782
We did this together.

18:05.783 --> 18:07.842
I appreciate that, but you were right.

18:07.843 --> 18:10.073
It doesn't make sense
for both of us to go down.

18:11.061 --> 18:12.956
You were counting
on me saying that, right?

18:12.957 --> 18:14.839
It's just that I make
so much more money...

18:14.840 --> 18:16.315
Yeah, y-you mentioned that.

18:21.679 --> 18:22.940
Hey, so, random...

18:22.941 --> 18:25.166
I was going through some old
security footage with Luanne.

18:25.167 --> 18:26.253
- Yeah?
- And you remember how we used

18:26.254 --> 18:28.588
to have those security
cameras in the break room?

18:28.589 --> 18:31.580
Well, we came across the time
you let all my birds escape.

18:32.929 --> 18:34.830
Uh... yeah. Um...

18:34.831 --> 18:36.060
Remember that?

18:36.061 --> 18:37.876
Remember? It was Valentine's Day.

18:37.877 --> 18:39.506
Remember? I was blaming myself for it,

18:39.507 --> 18:41.450
and then when I was at my
lowest, you had sex with me,

18:41.451 --> 18:44.007
knowing that, hours before, you
were the one that let them out.

18:44.008 --> 18:46.685
And you knew the entire time.
And yet, you said nothing.

18:46.686 --> 18:48.864
Remember that? So funny.

18:49.346 --> 18:51.308
Dina, I'm so, so sorry.

18:51.309 --> 18:53.368
Hey, come on.
Don't even worry about it.

18:53.370 --> 18:54.280
I forgive you.

18:54.281 --> 18:56.818
When you think about it,
this whole thing is just funny.

18:56.819 --> 18:59.521
Hey, come with me.
I want to show you something.

19:02.980 --> 19:05.947
They went up so fast,
it's like they wanted to burn.

19:05.949 --> 19:08.549
What's that sound?

19:08.550 --> 19:10.864
Is that air escaping from the sneakers?

19:11.288 --> 19:14.122
It almost sounds
like they're screaming.

19:18.395 --> 19:23.198
I will never forgive you... ever.

19:42.900 --> 19:44.469
Hey, Sandra.

19:44.470 --> 19:45.895
What's going on? Where are you going?

19:45.896 --> 19:49.086
I just got fired.
I don't know what happened.

19:49.087 --> 19:50.956
Luanne said I was the one
who was tweeting,

19:50.957 --> 19:52.778
but I swear to God, it wasn't me.

19:52.779 --> 19:54.292
- No, we know.
- Yeah, don't worry.

19:54.293 --> 19:56.722
- We are not gonna let this happen.
- We're gonna fix this.

19:56.723 --> 19:58.376
I never even joined Twitter

19:58.377 --> 20:00.616
'cause I was thinking
of running for City Council,

20:00.617 --> 20:02.901
and you know how my humor
can get a little edgy.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.115
There she is!

20:05.116 --> 20:08.450
Hey!

20:08.451 --> 20:11.793
Sandra, Sandra, Sandra, S...

20:12.380 --> 20:14.154
Ugh, what is wrong with you people?

20:14.155 --> 20:16.690
- Guys, I didn't do it.
- It's true, it... it wasn't her.

20:16.691 --> 20:19.105
Yeah, of course it wasn't you. Wink.

20:19.106 --> 20:20.708
Okay, guys, listen.

20:20.709 --> 20:23.925
Whoever did was pretty awesome, though.

20:23.927 --> 20:25.852
- Total superstar.
- She's a rebel.

20:25.853 --> 20:28.234
- She's a badass bitch.
- Justine, just go home.

20:28.235 --> 20:29.982
I have every right to be here.

20:29.983 --> 20:31.894
Guys, look, you know how corporate

20:31.895 --> 20:33.296
just kept cutting back our hours

20:33.297 --> 20:34.249
and cutting back our hours?

20:34.250 --> 20:36.501
- Yeah.
- I know they have.

20:36.502 --> 20:39.107
- Well...
- Well, sometimes

20:39.109 --> 20:42.562
you just got to say,
"Enough with the [bleep]."

20:42.563 --> 20:44.161
Yeah!

20:44.162 --> 20:45.974
It's like, you can only get
pushed around so much

20:45.976 --> 20:48.246
before you say, "No! This isn't fair."

20:49.107 --> 20:50.286
This isn't right."

20:50.287 --> 20:52.790
- What is happening?
- I have no idea.

20:52.791 --> 20:54.314
What are you gonna do?

20:55.492 --> 20:56.857
We're gonna... we're gonna stand up.

20:56.858 --> 20:57.695
- That's right.
- Yep.

20:57.696 --> 20:59.000
And we're gonna stay strong.

20:59.001 --> 21:00.624
- There she is.
- Yep, that's it.

21:00.625 --> 21:02.290
And we need to unionize!

21:04.433 --> 21:07.602
This is just the beginning! Yeah!

21:08.661 --> 21:11.154
Sandra! Sandra! Sandra!

21:11.155 --> 21:13.343
Sandra! Sandra!

21:13.344 --> 21:15.295
Sandra! Sandra!

21:15.296 --> 21:17.793
Sandra! Sandra! Sandra!
