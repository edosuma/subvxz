we'll hit up the titty club.

00:25.068 --> 00:27.402
Hey, yo, fam. What's up?

00:27.403 --> 00:29.404
My mixtape
dropped this week.

00:29.405 --> 00:31.189
It's tight as hell.

00:31.241 --> 00:33.158
Hey, you need this, man.
You need this in your life.

00:33.159 --> 00:34.776
New shit. New shit.

00:34.777 --> 00:36.862
Get it while
it's dope. Oh,

00:36.863 --> 00:38.413
Poseidon's here!

What's up, fam?

Oh, what's up,
Apollo?

00:44.087 --> 00:46.755
What's up, Moms?
What's up, Pops?

00:46.756 --> 00:49.006
One CD.

00:52.045 --> 00:54.213
Yo, who's this white dude?

00:54.214 --> 00:55.764
Hi, Cupid.
My name is Alan Gilbert.

00:55.765 --> 00:57.432
I'm a drug
and addiction specialist.

00:57.433 --> 00:59.434
We're here today to talk
to you about your dependence

00:59.435 --> 01:01.553
on alcohol and
codeine cough syrup.

01:01.554 --> 01:03.722
Yo, hold up.
This is an intervention?

01:03.723 --> 01:05.140
Oh, hell, no, man.
I ain't doing this shit.

01:05.141 --> 01:06.608
You will do it, or I shall

01:06.609 --> 01:09.728
smite thee with a thunderbolt!

01:09.729 --> 01:11.613
Now, Zeus, remember
what we talked about?

01:11.614 --> 01:13.615
We're coming
from a place of compassion.

01:13.616 --> 01:16.034
- Ah, this is such bullshit.
- Yes. Yeah, why don't you

01:16.035 --> 01:18.120
sit down, bitch?

01:18.121 --> 01:20.155
Mom, would you begin?

01:20.156 --> 01:22.624
Cupid,

01:22.625 --> 01:26.078
you used to bring love to
people of all shapes and sizes.

01:26.079 --> 01:27.579
You talk about the old me.
But now,

01:27.580 --> 01:29.131
you spend all your time
in nightclubs,

01:29.132 --> 01:31.300
only bringing love
to the worst type

01:31.301 --> 01:33.719
of people, like DJs and

01:33.720 --> 01:35.671
club promoters and

01:35.672 --> 01:37.589
guys who say they're producers,

01:37.590 --> 01:39.758
but when you look them up,
they haven't produced anything.

01:39.759 --> 01:41.393
That's 'cause all of those dudes
are there for me,

01:41.394 --> 01:42.978
when I real...
it comes down to it.

01:42.979 --> 01:44.563
Have any of you listened
to my mixtape?

01:44.564 --> 01:45.981
Be for real.

01:45.982 --> 01:47.766
Have you?

01:47.767 --> 01:50.352
I listened
to it.

01:50.353 --> 01:52.437
It struck me as
a cry for help.

01:52.438 --> 01:54.106
Whatever happened
to helping the little guy?

01:54.107 --> 01:56.241
Don't nice guys
deserve love, too?

01:56.242 --> 01:57.693
Yeah, nice guys don't have
yayo for Cupid.

01:57.694 --> 01:59.278
See? There he goes.

01:59.279 --> 02:00.779
He's drinking that damned
sizzurp again.

02:00.780 --> 02:02.281
Oh, like, you never did anything
bad in your life.

02:02.282 --> 02:03.415
What about that time
you turned into a swan,

02:03.416 --> 02:04.783
and you raped that lady?

02:04.784 --> 02:06.285
That's not... that's not
what this is about.

02:06.286 --> 02:07.369
- It could be.
- Or what about

02:07.370 --> 02:08.620
when you turned into that bull,

02:08.621 --> 02:10.088
and you raped that other lady?

02:10.089 --> 02:12.174
I admit it,
I made some mistakes, okay?

02:12.175 --> 02:13.508
You raped her
a bunch of times, too.

02:13.509 --> 02:15.043
Yup, yup, yup.

02:15.044 --> 02:16.595
But I don't
want you following

02:16.596 --> 02:17.879
in your old man's
footsteps.

02:17.880 --> 02:20.182
All I ever wanted...

02:20.183 --> 02:22.634
was to give you the life
that I never had.

02:22.635 --> 02:24.936
And all I ever wanted was
for you to be proud of me,

02:24.937 --> 02:26.388
but I was never enough!

02:26.389 --> 02:28.106
Cupid...

02:28.107 --> 02:30.642
I'll always be proud of you.
You're my son.

02:30.643 --> 02:33.528
Daddy.
Son.

02:33.529 --> 02:35.364
Cupid, I've got a plane ticket
with your name on it

02:35.365 --> 02:36.565
for a rehab center in Arizona.

02:36.566 --> 02:38.317
Do you accept?

02:38.318 --> 02:40.485
I do, Alan,
and I'm gonna start right now

02:40.486 --> 02:42.371
by hooking up
the world's biggest loser

02:42.372 --> 02:44.323
with some super hot chick.

02:44.324 --> 02:46.907
Good luck,
loser dumb-ass.

Dude, where have you been?

03:58.147 --> 03:59.948
I've been calling you all week.

03:59.949 --> 04:01.650
Hey, I'm sorry. I've just
been kind of busy.

04:01.651 --> 04:03.034
Busy with what?
You don't do anything.

04:03.035 --> 04:04.986
Well, I, uh...

04:04.987 --> 04:06.405
- I kind of, uh...
- Honey, where are your washcloths?

04:06.406 --> 04:07.906
Oh!
Oh! So sorry.

04:07.907 --> 04:09.574
I didn't realize we had company.

04:09.575 --> 04:11.576
- We just... he just arrived.
- No, uh, uh...

04:11.577 --> 04:13.412
- Ah. Oh, yeah.

- Whitney, this is, uh, Mike.
- Hi. Hi.

04:15.748 --> 04:17.132
I'm-I'm...
I'm Michael.

04:17.132 --> 04:18.632
- Okay.
- Uh-huh.

04:18.634 --> 04:20.918
- Yeah, cool. It's...
- Uh, no. Oh, okay.

04:20.920 --> 04:22.421
- I'm gonna jump in the shower.
- Yeah, you know where everything is.

04:22.422 --> 04:23.588
Uh-huh.
Shh.

04:23.589 --> 04:25.090
Oh, my God.

04:25.091 --> 04:26.391
- No?
- That's the hottest chick I have ever seen.

04:26.392 --> 04:29.644
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
she's-she's pretty cute.

04:29.645 --> 04:31.763
- I'm literally gonna jack off for a million years.
- Oh, my God.

04:31.764 --> 04:33.765
- I don't...
- I'm gonna rip my penis off.

04:33.766 --> 04:35.567
How did you pull that?

04:35.568 --> 04:39.237
Okay, so, uh, I was
having my lunch in the park.

04:39.238 --> 04:42.491
A gust of wind, uh, blustered
some napkins onto the ground.

04:42.492 --> 04:44.609
- I should get some napkins.
- Well, listen,

04:44.610 --> 04:46.661
I-I mean, it was more
of a moment, okay?

04:46.662 --> 04:48.413
- Oh.
- Like, it's-it's not sort of a template

04:48.414 --> 04:51.116
as much as it is
an organic happening.

04:51.117 --> 04:54.619
What am I doing?
What am I doing?

04:54.620 --> 04:57.622
I don't know. I mean, I would
think you should just be happy

04:57.623 --> 04:59.257
that I found someone
I like spending time with.

04:59.258 --> 05:01.626
Sure, yeah, I'm
happy, but, uh...

05:01.627 --> 05:03.295
What about me, man?

05:03.296 --> 05:04.846
Where's my piece
of the pie?

05:04.847 --> 05:06.631
It's okay. It's okay.

05:06.632 --> 05:07.933
You're living the dream.

05:07.934 --> 05:09.968
Thank-thank you.

05:09.969 --> 05:11.436
You're an American hero.

05:11.437 --> 05:13.305
- Oh, come on.
- No, seriously.

05:13.306 --> 05:14.940
I'm...
Thank-thank you.

05:14.941 --> 05:16.308
- Thank you.
- I'm so proud of you.

05:16.309 --> 05:17.809
So proud of you.

05:17.810 --> 05:19.528
You're doing God's
work now, okay?

05:19.529 --> 05:21.396
I guess. I guess.

05:21.397 --> 05:23.031
I guess maybe I am.

05:23.032 --> 05:24.483
I guess maybe I am.

05:24.484 --> 05:26.818
Absolutely.

05:26.819 --> 05:29.571
Yeah? Huh.

05:29.572 --> 05:31.456
Oh, hey, uh, Jessica?
Do I know you?

05:31.457 --> 05:33.325
Josh Greenberg. We were
in middle school together.

05:33.326 --> 05:34.993
I actually had
a huge crush on you,

05:34.994 --> 05:36.711
even though
you were super cruel to me

05:36.712 --> 05:38.246
and often called me a gaylord.

05:38.247 --> 05:39.748
God, it's been forever.

05:39.749 --> 05:41.883
- This is my girlfriend Whitney.
- Hi.

05:41.884 --> 05:44.252
Wow.

05:44.253 --> 05:45.670
Hey, big sister
who thought

05:45.671 --> 05:47.172
I needed help
finding a girlfriend.

05:47.173 --> 05:50.392
- Hey.
- Oh. Shows what I know.

05:50.393 --> 05:53.428
Hey, childhood bully who used to
throw milk cartons at my face.

05:53.429 --> 05:55.897
Pretty good, right?

05:55.898 --> 05:59.267
- Hey, ex-girlfriend who broke my heart.
- Hey.

05:59.268 --> 06:01.186
Hey, Spanish professor who
said I was bad at Spanish.

06:01.187 --> 06:03.103
<i>Hola, Yosh. ¿Que pasa?</i>

06:04.774 --> 06:06.691
What?

06:06.692 --> 06:08.360
Remember when you
asked me if I've been, uh,

06:08.361 --> 06:10.028
sexually active any time
in the last three months?

06:10.029 --> 06:12.113
You said, "Sort of." And I said,
"What does that mean?"

06:12.114 --> 06:14.199
And you said, "Actually, no."
And then I raised

06:14.200 --> 06:15.784
my eyebrows
as if to silently judge you.

06:15.785 --> 06:18.670
Uh, so here's my girlfriend,
Whitney.

06:18.671 --> 06:19.588
Hello. Nice to meet you.

06:19.589 --> 06:21.873
Hi.

06:21.874 --> 06:23.375
Hey, dog
that used to scare me.

06:23.376 --> 06:25.010
Go. Go.

06:25.011 --> 06:26.378
Hey, long book
I couldn't finish.

06:26.379 --> 06:29.097
I want to make sure you met, uh,
current girlfriend Whitney.

06:29.098 --> 06:31.850
- Yeah. I met her.
- Yeah, I'm just double-double-checking.

06:31.851 --> 06:33.218
- I got it. Good-bye.
<i>-  Josh, first of all,</i>

06:33.219 --> 06:35.637
gaylord-- I could not have been
more wrong on that one.

06:35.638 --> 06:37.522
You're clearly some kind
of straightlord.

06:37.523 --> 06:38.473
- Thank you very much.
- I should have married you

06:38.474 --> 06:39.641
instead of this guy.

06:39.642 --> 06:41.059
When she's right,
she's right.

06:41.060 --> 06:42.727
- They seem nice.
- Oh, they (bleep)ing suck.

06:42.728 --> 06:46.063
I thought I was smart,
but, in fact, I'm stupid.

06:46.065 --> 06:47.449
Guess I won't be needing
this anymore.

06:47.450 --> 06:49.734
- Probably not.
- He seems nice.

06:49.735 --> 06:51.703
And, uh, you know, we-we met.
I was just on a bench

06:51.704 --> 06:55.240
chasing napkins. Never give up
on your dreams, okay?

06:55.241 --> 06:57.207
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

06:58.578 --> 06:59.744
Yeah!

07:01.247 --> 07:03.965
Hey, Granddad, who was
brave and fought in wars.

07:03.966 --> 07:06.501
I miss you.

07:06.502 --> 07:09.254
He seemed nice.

07:09.255 --> 07:11.089
- I'm getting really tired.
- I know. L-Last stop, I promise.

07:11.090 --> 07:12.257
- Okay.
- Uh, knock knock.

07:12.258 --> 07:14.009
Hey, you're the temp, right?

07:14.010 --> 07:15.927
- Uh, Jeremy whatever?
- It's, uh,

07:15.928 --> 07:18.597
- Josh, actually. Um, so...
- What's up, Josh?

07:18.598 --> 07:21.888
I just wanted you, my boss,
to meet my girlfriend Whitney.

07:22.018 --> 07:24.136
Hi. Charles Powell,

07:24.137 --> 07:27.472
CEO of Powell Consulting.
Have a seat right here.

07:27.473 --> 07:29.975
Whitney, that is
a beautiful name.

07:29.976 --> 07:31.310
- You ever flown a Cessna?
- Nope.

07:31.311 --> 07:32.811
- Never?
- I have not.

07:32.812 --> 07:34.813
- Not once?
- Not once.

07:34.814 --> 07:38.400
You? Cute little you.
You've never flown in a Cessna?

07:38.401 --> 07:40.652
No one has ever offered
you a ride in a Cessna?

07:40.653 --> 07:44.289
No...

07:44.290 --> 07:46.375
- Go to the airport.
- We will take... Let's go for a ride.

07:46.376 --> 07:48.327
Yeah, we-we got to go.

07:48.328 --> 07:50.495
We may have some where we're
going. So just give it a second.

07:50.496 --> 07:51.997
- He seemed nice.
- No, he's not nice.

07:51.998 --> 07:55.299
- None-none of these people are nice!
- Hi.

07:57.141 --> 07:59.674
- Hey. Nice shoes. Where'd you get 'em?
- No. Hi.

07:59.676 --> 08:01.460
Thank you.
Oh, a little boutique.

08:01.461 --> 08:03.712
- Doesn't matter.
-  Hey, hey. Virgo.

08:03.714 --> 08:07.601
- August 29! Oh, my God.
- No, no. No! Stop it!

08:07.601 --> 08:09.602
- We're going home. It's a nice home.
- Okay.

08:09.603 --> 08:11.303
- Hello, beautiful!
- Oh! Wait, careful, bud!

08:11.304 --> 08:12.354
Hi, Ravi.

08:12.355 --> 08:13.389
What, you know this guy?

08:13.390 --> 08:14.523
Yeah. He's my yoga instructor.

08:14.524 --> 08:16.692
You're tight.
We need a session.

08:16.693 --> 08:18.477
We need to get
your body loose again.

08:18.478 --> 08:20.062
- You guys all need to stop.
- No, we...

08:20.063 --> 08:23.532
We need to get you loose...!

08:23.533 --> 08:27.486
Not every guy that's nice to me
is trying to sleep with me.

08:27.487 --> 08:29.571
- I don't actually think that's true.
- This may come

08:29.572 --> 08:31.073
as a surprise to you,
but some guys

08:31.074 --> 08:32.908
are actually interested in me
as a human being.

08:34.410 --> 08:36.328
No.

08:36.328 --> 08:38.246
You're right, you're right,
you're right.

08:38.248 --> 08:40.082
I'm just being, uh, jealous.

08:40.082 --> 08:42.333
I won't let it happen again.

08:42.335 --> 08:44.003
I appreciate that.

08:44.004 --> 08:46.472
Yeah, of course.

08:46.473 --> 08:47.840
- He's here.

08:47.841 --> 08:49.925
Uh, who's-who's, uh, here?

08:49.926 --> 08:51.927
- Hello?
- Tanaka. Tanaka.

08:51.928 --> 08:54.420
Hi. Come on in.
First door on the right.

08:54.676 --> 08:57.348
- Who's-who's that?
- I invited my friend Tanaka over.

08:57.350 --> 08:59.685
He's visiting from Japan.
Didn't I tell you?

08:59.686 --> 09:01.637
- No. No.
- Remember,

09:01.638 --> 09:04.523
I met him on my study abroad.
He took me to see Coldplay.

09:04.524 --> 09:07.024
He's a giant Japanese
penis monster.

09:08.695 --> 09:10.529
I could've swore
you just said

09:10.530 --> 09:13.649
uh, "Japanese penis monster."

09:13.650 --> 09:15.200
Well,
Tanaka's an octopoid creature

09:15.201 --> 09:16.952
from an alternate universe
whose body consists

09:16.953 --> 09:18.954
- entirely of penises.
- Uh, uh, he's...

09:18.955 --> 09:21.657
he's, um... What? What?

09:21.658 --> 09:23.325
He's traveling, right now,
through time and space

09:23.326 --> 09:25.294
seeking out orifices to
penetrate with his many penises.

09:25.295 --> 09:26.495
He's amazing.

09:26.496 --> 09:27.796
Tanaka.

09:27.797 --> 09:29.715
- Coming!
- He-he, uh...

09:29.716 --> 09:31.466
- This is, uh...
- Tanaka!

09:31.467 --> 09:33.585
- WHITNEY: Tanaka! Hi!
- Oh, (bleep).

09:33.586 --> 09:36.388
It's so good to see you. I missed you.

09:36.389 --> 09:37.506
How was the trip?

09:37.507 --> 09:39.391
- You get here okay?
- Tanaka. Tanaka.

09:39.392 --> 09:41.318
- Kill it! Kill it!
- I want you to meet Josh.

09:41.320 --> 09:43.187
Josh, come say hi to Tanaka.

09:43.646 --> 09:45.847
Oh, hey, hey.

09:45.848 --> 09:47.900
Hey, man. Welcome.

09:47.901 --> 09:51.270
- He wants you to shake his penis.
- Tanaka.

09:51.272 --> 09:53.606
- Tanaka.
- Hi.

09:53.606 --> 09:54.907
Nice to...

09:54.908 --> 09:57.276
Uh, Josh. Greenberg.

09:57.277 --> 09:59.278
Tanaka.

09:59.280 --> 10:01.531
I'm so excited you guys are finally meeting.

10:01.531 --> 10:02.998
Tanaka.

10:02.999 --> 10:04.199
- Yay.
- Tanaka, Tanaka.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.866
- Tanaka, Tanaka,
- Oh.

10:07.620 --> 10:08.954
God. Th...

10:08.955 --> 10:10.756
Mm, Tanaka.

10:13.176 --> 10:14.293
Tanaka, Tanaka, Tanaka.

10:14.294 --> 10:15.427
Okay, oh, my...

10:15.428 --> 10:17.379
This is awful.

10:17.380 --> 10:19.765
Tanaka, Tanaka,
Tanaka, Tanaka-naka-kaka.

10:19.766 --> 10:21.433
Tanaka, Tanaka.

10:21.434 --> 10:22.718
-- You're so bad!

10:22.719 --> 10:24.469
I hate him.

10:24.470 --> 10:26.054
- What?
- What-What's the, uh...

10:26.055 --> 10:28.557
How's he bad? What's...

10:28.558 --> 10:29.975
Just an inside joke.

10:29.976 --> 10:31.193
I, let me inside.

10:31.194 --> 10:32.277
I-I'll be inside.

10:32.278 --> 10:33.729
Just, what-what's the joke?

10:33.730 --> 10:35.948
Well, Tanaka was just talking

10:35.949 --> 10:37.566
about this girl
that he used to date

10:37.567 --> 10:40.368
and how his condom bill was,
like, through the roof.

10:40.370 --> 10:41.954
Tanaka.

10:41.955 --> 10:43.288
Because of his...

10:43.289 --> 10:45.324
- He has a lot of penises.
- Oh, no.

10:45.325 --> 10:46.408
Yeah, no, I got it.

10:46.409 --> 10:47.960
Yeah, that's, that is adorable.

10:47.961 --> 10:50.162
That's... that's so funny.

10:50.163 --> 10:51.496
Tanaka?

10:51.497 --> 10:52.914
No, he has...

10:52.915 --> 10:54.166
He has a sense of humor;
he gets it.

10:54.167 --> 10:56.885
He gets it.
I'm gonna get some more wine.

10:56.886 --> 10:58.420
- Oh, okay. All right.
- Tanaka.

10:58.421 --> 11:00.254
I won't.

11:01.591 --> 11:02.891
So...

11:02.892 --> 11:05.559
Um, Japan.

11:08.765 --> 11:10.983
I don't know anything
about that place.

11:10.984 --> 11:13.485
Long days.

11:13.486 --> 11:16.071
Long days.

11:16.072 --> 11:19.191
You like manga?

11:19.192 --> 11:20.525
You...

11:20.526 --> 11:21.827
Oh, I'm back.

11:21.828 --> 11:23.996
Ah, Tanaka-Naka-Naka-Naka!

11:25.832 --> 11:26.748
Honey, we don't have
any more wine.

11:26.749 --> 11:30.085
Do you think you can
go to the store and get some?

11:30.086 --> 11:33.422
So you want me to leave you
in my apartment with, uh...

11:33.423 --> 11:34.840
Tanaka.

11:34.841 --> 11:36.041
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

11:36.042 --> 11:37.959
Just to get some more wine.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.461
Shit, yeah, okay.

11:39.462 --> 11:41.095
So-so I'll... yeah, yep.

11:43.549 --> 11:44.967
Hey...

11:45.051 --> 11:46.885
tell me everything
about Burning Man.

11:46.886 --> 11:48.504
Tanaka, Tanaka...

11:48.505 --> 11:50.005
- Oh, really?
- Tanaka, Tanaka.

11:50.006 --> 11:51.757
Oh, my God,
did you have so much fun?

11:51.758 --> 11:53.307
Where was your guys' tent?

12:00.683 --> 12:03.685
You're still dating nice girl?

12:03.686 --> 12:05.854
Oh, yes, yes,
still-still dating nice girl.

12:05.855 --> 12:07.773
You drive Lamborghini?

12:07.774 --> 12:09.441
Do I drive a... No.

12:10.443 --> 12:11.660
You own real estate?

12:11.661 --> 12:13.195
Do I own real est... No.

12:13.196 --> 12:15.164
Tycoon? Greek tycoon,
something like this?

12:15.165 --> 12:16.115
- No.
- I mean, in...

12:16.116 --> 12:17.533
In my experience, my friend,

12:17.534 --> 12:19.034
to be with a lady like this,

12:19.035 --> 12:20.536
you have to have something.

12:20.537 --> 12:22.037
You have to buy better wine
than this.

12:22.038 --> 12:23.539
- Thank you.
- Can you...

12:23.540 --> 12:24.790
Can you tell her I say hi?

12:24.791 --> 12:26.508
<i>I-I can't help</i>

12:26.509 --> 12:28.093
but get the feeling
that this, uh,

12:28.094 --> 12:29.878
this Tanaka character,

12:29.879 --> 12:32.681
he really just hangs out with Whitney
'cause he wants to have sex with her.

12:32.682 --> 12:34.550
Yeah, so you guys have
got something in common.

12:34.551 --> 12:38.103
No, no, no, no, I hang out with
her for a lot of reasons, okay?

12:38.104 --> 12:40.773
She-she's got
some great ideas, okay?

12:40.774 --> 12:43.859
She-she, uh, she's got
a cute-cute little jacket.

12:43.860 --> 12:46.028
She smells wonderful.

12:46.029 --> 12:47.980
Josh, is this really
a healthy relationship,

12:47.981 --> 12:50.399
or are you just trying
to make it work 'cause she's...

12:50.400 --> 12:52.951
more beautiful than any
other girl you've ever dated?

12:52.952 --> 12:54.903
Wait, is-is-is she beautiful?

12:54.904 --> 12:57.239
I mean, I mean, 'cause, I mean,
I don't think of those things.

12:57.240 --> 12:58.907
I mean, every woman
is beautiful to me.

12:58.908 --> 13:01.160
A woman can hang out
with a friend.

13:01.161 --> 13:02.794
A male friend.

13:04.247 --> 13:05.380
No... no...

13:05.381 --> 13:06.832
You sound desperate

13:06.833 --> 13:09.751
and paranoid,
which is not attractive.

13:09.752 --> 13:11.920
If you're confident in yourself,

13:11.921 --> 13:14.423
it doesn't matter
how many penises Tanaka has.

13:14.424 --> 13:16.341
I am <i> not</i> insecure. I...

13:16.342 --> 13:17.810
I'm a goddamned American hero!

13:17.811 --> 13:19.511
What?

13:19.512 --> 13:21.680
Uh, I... never... I gotta go.

13:21.681 --> 13:24.065
- Got the...
- Ooh, Tanaka, naka.

13:24.067 --> 13:26.185
You get your filthy
penises off of her!

13:26.186 --> 13:27.736
What?
Huh?

13:27.737 --> 13:29.738
Josh, he's just giving me
a back massage.

13:29.739 --> 13:32.324
Oh, come on! Really?

13:32.325 --> 13:34.193
I'm pretty sure he was trying
to have sex with you.

13:34.194 --> 13:36.695
Are you really doing this again?
For the last time, he's my friend.

13:36.696 --> 13:38.447
- Tanaka...
- I'm serious. Just...

13:38.448 --> 13:40.115
just step off.

13:40.116 --> 13:42.367
Josh, you're being
a huge asshole!

13:42.368 --> 13:43.785
- Tanaka! Tanaka! Tanaka!
- No, stop it, all right?

13:43.786 --> 13:45.420
It's just...
it's a figure of speech.

13:45.421 --> 13:46.872
- Tanaka.
- Okay, fine, fine.

13:46.873 --> 13:48.674
So... so...

13:48.675 --> 13:50.292
Okay, I'm paranoid.

13:50.293 --> 13:52.594
I'm-I'm paranoid.

13:52.595 --> 13:55.214
The penis monster
makes me uncomfortable.

13:55.215 --> 13:57.466
You have a penis;
he has a few more.

13:57.467 --> 14:00.018
- Why is that so threatening?
- I am asking you

14:00.019 --> 14:01.887
as your boyfriend...

14:01.888 --> 14:03.805
please stop
hanging out with him.

14:03.806 --> 14:05.023
Josh...

14:05.024 --> 14:06.308
please don't make me choose

14:06.309 --> 14:07.809
between you and my friend.

14:07.810 --> 14:09.311
I can't believe
this is happening.

14:09.312 --> 14:11.730
Hm. I didn't realize
you were so insecure.

14:11.731 --> 14:14.316
Listen, I'm just trying to--
get away!

14:14.318 --> 14:15.201
- Tanaka.
- Josh,

14:15.201 --> 14:16.985
he's just trying to be nice.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.654
I know that.
I-I appreciate that.

14:18.655 --> 14:20.205
- But I'm saying-- oh, my God...
- Tanaka.

14:20.206 --> 14:22.875
- Naka.
- Oh, my... oh, God.

14:22.876 --> 14:25.043
Okay, it's in my mouth...
it got in my mouth that time.

14:25.044 --> 14:26.995
- Oh, God. Tanaka, please!
- You're being

14:26.996 --> 14:29.164
- very rude to my friend, Josh.
- You're...

14:29.165 --> 14:31.216
you're touching his penis.
You're touching one

14:31.218 --> 14:33.102
- of his penises. His penis is on you!
- Yeah? So?

14:33.102 --> 14:34.503
It's in your hands!

14:34.504 --> 14:35.671
- Tanaka.
- For  sake,

14:35.672 --> 14:37.506
Tanaka, will you please mind

14:37.507 --> 14:39.675
- your own goddamn business?
- Josh!

14:39.676 --> 14:41.510
- Whitney... Oh, my...
- Tanaka!

14:41.511 --> 14:42.678
Oh... God!

14:42.679 --> 14:43.729
Tanaka.

14:43.730 --> 14:45.295
Tanaka.

14:45.732 --> 14:48.454
I can't break up with
Whitney. No, I...

14:48.455 --> 14:51.257
Have you seen her?
She's... she's...

14:51.258 --> 14:52.375
she's... she's...

14:52.376 --> 14:54.843
everything I've ever wanted.

14:56.130 --> 14:57.764
Okay.

14:57.765 --> 15:00.633
- She make you happy?
- Sh...

15:00.634 --> 15:03.970
Being with her makes me
feel better about myself.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.721
But just because

15:05.722 --> 15:08.724
she is kind of perfect...

15:08.725 --> 15:12.395
doesn't mean
she's perfect for you.

15:17.256 --> 15:20.453
Do you remember, in seventh grade,
when you begged...

15:20.454 --> 15:23.206
for a FUBU jacket
for Hanukkah?

15:23.208 --> 15:25.659
- My God.

15:25.659 --> 15:27.743
You loved that thing,
you remember?

15:27.744 --> 15:29.295
It was shiny...

15:29.296 --> 15:31.297
and it had these
big puffy sleeves

15:31.298 --> 15:32.965
with the racer stripe
down them.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.167
- Yep.
- You wore it,

15:34.168 --> 15:35.401
- like, every day.
- Uh-huh.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.086
But it didn't fit you.

15:37.686 --> 15:39.270
And eventually, we...

15:39.272 --> 15:41.573
you know, we had
to give it to Goodwill.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.158
Which you cried about for...

15:43.159 --> 15:44.660
a long time.

15:44.661 --> 15:46.779
- Yeah, I-I know.
- Then we got you

15:46.780 --> 15:49.248
- that Lands' End jacket.
- Mm-hmm.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.617
And it... it was
a great fit.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.920
Someday you're
gonna find your...

15:54.921 --> 15:57.872
Lands' End lady.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.093
<i>Tanaka says he's really sorry</i>

16:01.094 --> 16:02.294
about what happened.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.378
That's, that's
nice of him.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.264
How's your cheek?

16:05.265 --> 16:08.050
Um... not-not so bad.
Ooh.

16:09.602 --> 16:10.654
How's his penis?

16:10.656 --> 16:11.656
It's really swollen.

16:11.658 --> 16:12.970
Aw, that's too bad.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.257
Josh, what's been
going on with you?

16:15.258 --> 16:16.725
You've been acting
so weird.

16:16.726 --> 16:17.926
Yeah, I, uh...

16:20.180 --> 16:22.932
Forgive me, Whitney,
I'm sorry, uh,

16:22.933 --> 16:25.184
but we-we-we need,
we need to-to break up.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.852
- No, but...
- Yeah.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.938
- I-I can't handle it.
- Really?

16:28.939 --> 16:30.322
I... wait... I'm sorry.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.774
We, we need, we need
to break up.

16:36.746 --> 16:39.498
<i> Just because</i>
<i>she's kind of perfect</i>

16:39.499 --> 16:43.002
<i>doesn't mean she's perfect</i>
<i>for you... for you...</i>

16:43.003 --> 16:44.920
<i>Gaylord, I could not have been</i>
<i>more wrong on that one.</i>

16:44.921 --> 16:47.840
<i>You're clearly some kind of straightlord...
straightlord...</i>

16:47.841 --> 16:50.543
Holà, Yosh!
¿Que pasa? ¿Que pasa?

16:50.544 --> 16:51.961
<i>That's the hottest chick</i>
<i>I've ever seen.</i>

16:51.962 --> 16:53.762
<i>That's the hottest</i>
<i>chick I've ever seen.</i>

16:53.763 --> 16:55.047
<i>You're living the dream.</i>
<i>You're living the dream.</i>

16:55.048 --> 16:55.931
You know what?

16:55.932 --> 16:56.932
Put a pin in that.

16:56.933 --> 16:58.851
I was... so wrong.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.387
I am... I was
an insecure idiot.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.722
I am so... so very sorry.

17:03.723 --> 17:04.890
Can we just...

17:04.891 --> 17:06.025
Just, please take me back.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.060
Josh, I'm really happy
to hear that.

17:09.061 --> 17:10.029
- Thank you.
- Good, good.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.230
But I'm engaged now.

17:11.231 --> 17:14.366
- What?
- I'm engaged. See?

17:14.367 --> 17:16.402
We broke up ten seconds ago.

17:16.403 --> 17:18.954
And it was the hardest
ten seconds of my life.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.873
I was in a really bad place.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.241
But I did some soul searching,

17:22.242 --> 17:23.709
and eventually,
I had to move on.

17:23.710 --> 17:24.993
Right, okay.

17:24.994 --> 17:27.746
I'm just trying to do the... the
math, figure out the chronology.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.583
I literally walked...
just over there.

17:30.584 --> 17:32.885
- Hey, babe. Who's this?
- What? Oh...

17:32.886 --> 17:35.471
Hey, Roger.
This is my old boyfriend Josh.

17:35.472 --> 17:38.007
Josh, this is Roger,
my fiancé.

17:38.008 --> 17:39.642
Josh! I've heard
a lot about you!

17:39.643 --> 17:40.643
Oh.

17:40.644 --> 17:43.429
The shipping industry
sounds absolutely fantastic.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.064
Oh, no, honey, that was Nico,
my boyfriend after Josh.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.181
Josh was the temp.

17:46.182 --> 17:47.600
- There was another guy?
- Mm-hmm.

17:47.601 --> 17:49.818
Dear, um, can...
can I have a word?

17:49.819 --> 17:50.936
Sure.

17:50.937 --> 17:52.271
What is it?

17:52.272 --> 17:55.658
It's-it's this guy,
uh, Josh, um...

17:55.659 --> 17:57.076
I think he's into you.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.494
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

17:58.495 --> 18:00.279
He and I are ancient history.

18:00.280 --> 18:03.115
The guy just makes me feel
really uncomfortable.

18:03.116 --> 18:06.785
Well... I think
you're being paranoid.

18:06.786 --> 18:11.709
But, if it bothers you,
I'll never talk to him again.

18:12.092 --> 18:13.841
Thanks, babe.

18:17.213 --> 18:19.381
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:19.382 --> 18:21.133
So, I don't think we should
hang out anymore.

18:21.134 --> 18:23.135
- I hope you understand.
- Oh, yeah.

18:23.136 --> 18:24.637
- Bye.
- Bye.

18:24.638 --> 18:26.722
Good-bye.

18:26.723 --> 18:28.189
Dude... dude.

18:35.424 --> 18:37.259
Yeah, I guess, uh...

18:37.260 --> 18:39.192
girls like that don't stay
on the market for too long.

18:39.194 --> 18:40.661
Mm-hmm. Tanaka.

18:40.662 --> 18:42.447
It... it really does suck.

18:42.448 --> 18:43.498
Tanaka.

18:43.499 --> 18:45.950
Mm!

18:45.951 --> 18:47.502
Just tell me, you...

18:47.503 --> 18:48.953
Tanaka?

18:48.954 --> 18:51.038
You were hitting on here, right?

18:51.039 --> 18:53.257
I mean, I was-I was-I wasn't
just making that up, was I?

18:53.258 --> 18:56.677
Tanaka, naka, naka.

18:56.678 --> 18:58.212
I knew it.

18:58.213 --> 18:59.514
I knew it!

18:59.515 --> 19:00.798
Tanaka.

19:03.018 --> 19:03.800
Pals.

19:10.948 --> 19:13.472
- Good-bye, son.
- Bye, mom. Bye, dad.

19:13.474 --> 19:14.918
It's a new day for Cupid.

19:14.919 --> 19:16.919
It's a new day for love.

19:17.693 --> 19:19.693
Can you help me do the wings? 'Cause...

19:20.919 --> 19:22.199
Okay... Hey, could somebody help me?

19:22.200 --> 19:24.200
Hey, Hey, one of you
dudes, can you help me... just...?

19:24.201 --> 19:26.201
Get well soon.

19:26.202 --> 19:29.840
