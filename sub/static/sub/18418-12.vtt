00:00.620 --> 00:02.040
- Previously on "Nashville"...

00:02.040 --> 00:03.750
- Why did mom have to die?

00:03.750 --> 00:06.250
- It's hard to understand why
some things happen.

00:06.250 --> 00:08.170
- I think I can help
Highway 65 flourish.

00:08.170 --> 00:10.000
- We thought our deal with Zach
didn't have a downside.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.290
But if he decides to yank
his money out, we're dead.

00:12.290 --> 00:14.750
- I want my next album
to be a gospel album.

00:14.750 --> 00:16.790
- Our religion isn't a business.

00:16.790 --> 00:18.670
- And you think that
making a gospel album

00:18.670 --> 00:20.000
is good business for me?

00:20.000 --> 00:21.500
- Sorry to cause you
such difficulty.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.210
- You're the one who
brought up business.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.040
- I'm pregnant.
- And I'm...?

00:27.040 --> 00:28.580
- Don't know.

00:37.210 --> 00:40.000

00:40.000 --> 00:41.580
Our album's almost out.

00:41.580 --> 00:43.330
- Thank you so much.

00:43.330 --> 00:46.750
- I could've never done it
without you guys. Never.

00:46.750 --> 00:49.960
- Reviews are in!

00:49.960 --> 00:51.710
"Juliette Barnes'
new album, "Grateful",

00:51.710 --> 00:54.920
marks an unlikely new direction
for the country pop diva."

00:57.670 --> 00:59.830
Uh..."Backed by angelic
harmonies

00:59.830 --> 01:03.540
from the Mountain Rose
Baptist Church..."

01:03.540 --> 01:05.880
- Woo!
- Yeah!

01:05.880 --> 01:07.290
- You're skipping parts.
- Okay. It's okay. I got it.

01:07.290 --> 01:08.710
- Let me see--
- "It's a bold attempt

01:08.710 --> 01:11.080
- Let me see!
- at a crossover..."

01:11.080 --> 01:12.920
- "It's a bold attempt
at a crossover,

01:12.920 --> 01:15.670
but the result is a..."
- Treacly.

01:15.670 --> 01:19.670
- Treacly mess that,
unlike Barnes, can't be saved."

01:19.670 --> 01:22.750
- Just one fool's opinion!
- Well, forget him.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.000
- Yeah, some of these critics
just want to hate everything.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.960
- Hold on, hold on.
Rolling Stone:

01:27.960 --> 01:32.120
"Juliette Barnes' culturally
tone-deaf, passion project

01:32.120 --> 01:33.790
tries to make a statement
about salvation.

01:33.790 --> 01:36.790
But instead comes off
as strange and inappropriate."

01:36.790 --> 01:38.170
- That's crazy.

01:38.170 --> 01:39.670
- Couldn't you find
one good review?

01:39.670 --> 01:41.620
- I'm trying.

01:41.620 --> 01:43.920
- You should be proud
of your work, all of you.

01:43.920 --> 01:45.710
- That's right.

01:48.460 --> 01:50.170
- Just give me a minute.

02:02.920 --> 02:04.500
(knocking on door)

02:04.500 --> 02:06.250
- Deacon? You got a minute to go
over a couple of things?

02:06.250 --> 02:07.960
- Uh, yeah.
Could we do it over coffee?

02:07.960 --> 02:09.380
- You bet.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.620
- What about the Exes?
- Thank you.

02:12.620 --> 02:14.210
Nothing booked for the Exes
till the festival.

02:14.210 --> 02:16.290
Give them a chance to rest up
before the tour.

02:16.290 --> 02:18.250
- (laughter) Yes!

02:18.250 --> 02:19.750
- What's Zach got
brewing in there?

02:19.750 --> 02:23.040
- Don't ask me.
I just run the place.

02:25.880 --> 02:29.670
(phone rings)

02:29.670 --> 02:32.250
- Go ahead.
- Thank you. Hello?

02:32.250 --> 02:33.920
- Hello, Mr. Claybourne.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.540
This is Principal Platt
at Langhorne Academy.

02:35.540 --> 02:37.750
- Everything all right?
Is Daphne okay?

02:37.750 --> 02:39.170
- Yes. There's no emergency.

02:39.170 --> 02:41.000
I'm calling because
we're concerned

02:41.000 --> 02:44.080
about her academic performance.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.500
- Yes, ma'am.
I know that she's been behind

02:46.500 --> 02:48.330
a little bit since her mom...

02:48.330 --> 02:51.540
- Yes, I understand, and
I'm very sorry for your loss.

02:51.540 --> 02:54.170
She's been through
a lot this semester.

02:54.170 --> 02:57.080
But, every student must
fulfill the same requirements

02:57.080 --> 02:59.790
in order to pass the year,
and Daphne's such a bright girl.

02:59.790 --> 03:03.080
We don't want her to have
to repeat the seventh grade.

03:03.080 --> 03:05.290
- Well, then I can assure you
that will not happen.

03:05.290 --> 03:06.540
Can you hold on one second?

03:06.540 --> 03:08.420
Zach, what's going on?

03:08.420 --> 03:11.250
- Just brainstorming how to
achieve world domination.

03:11.250 --> 03:13.420
Seriously, though, I am stoked
to sit down with you guys,

03:13.420 --> 03:15.080
and talk about strategy.
I gotta run right now.

03:15.080 --> 03:16.210
But let's set a meeting, okay?

03:16.210 --> 03:18.580
- Great. Good.
- All right.

03:20.460 --> 03:23.460
- I'm very sorry, ma'am.
Please go on.

03:23.460 --> 03:26.620
- So you're sure there's only
one other potential father?

03:26.620 --> 03:28.920
- Yeah. Just one.
And uh...

03:28.920 --> 03:30.540
He doesn't know I'm pregnant.

03:30.540 --> 03:31.830
And I would rather
not involve him

03:31.830 --> 03:33.170
if I don't have to.

03:33.170 --> 03:34.880
- Well, no need.
Your friend's cheek swab

03:34.880 --> 03:36.500
will tell the lab
whether he's a match.

03:36.500 --> 03:39.250
So by process of elimination.

03:39.250 --> 03:41.120
Any other questions?
- No.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.420
- Your results should be
ready by next week.

03:42.420 --> 03:44.120
- Mm-hm. Thanks.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.420
- Hey.
- Hi.

03:48.420 --> 03:49.960
- Hold your arm out for me?

03:52.380 --> 03:54.290
Have you eaten today?

03:54.290 --> 03:56.920
- Uh, just toast, my stomach's
been kind of sensitive.

03:56.920 --> 03:59.960
- I been there.
I have four kids.

03:59.960 --> 04:01.920
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.380
You make sure you eat after
you leave here, though, okay?

04:04.380 --> 04:05.920
Wouldn't want you
fainting out there.

04:05.920 --> 04:07.170
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.920
- You all right, sweetie?

04:10.920 --> 04:12.750
- Yeah. Just...

04:12.750 --> 04:15.500
- A little scared?

04:15.500 --> 04:18.170
- Yeah.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.420
I never thought
this would be me.

04:20.420 --> 04:21.960
I've always been careful.

04:21.960 --> 04:24.830
I take my pill the same time
every single day.

04:24.830 --> 04:27.420
And it still happened...
Ow.

04:27.420 --> 04:30.000
The whole potential father
thing is just...

04:30.000 --> 04:31.330
I'm sorry. I don't know why
I'm telling you all this.

04:31.330 --> 04:33.880
I know it's gonna be fine.

04:33.880 --> 04:35.880
- The test is very reliable.

04:35.880 --> 04:37.540
- Great.

04:37.540 --> 04:41.330
- And you are all done.
- Thanks.

04:41.330 --> 04:42.460
- Okay, you can get dressed.

04:42.460 --> 04:44.000
(text message rings)

04:47.830 --> 04:51.790
(music playing)

04:51.790 --> 04:52.880
(knocking on door)

04:52.880 --> 04:54.040
- Come in.

04:57.670 --> 04:58.880
- Your school called.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.920
- Seriously?
- Yes.

05:00.920 --> 05:03.170
- I only missed
like, four assignments.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.920
- Just four, huh?
That's all?

05:05.920 --> 05:08.500
- It's physically impossible
to turn in homework every day.

05:08.500 --> 05:11.040
- You managed up till now.

05:12.790 --> 05:14.960
Look, believe me,

05:14.960 --> 05:16.880
nobody expects
you to be perfect.

05:16.880 --> 05:18.670
But you gotta come to me
with these things.

05:18.670 --> 05:21.210
This isn't just a few
assignments, Daphne.

05:21.210 --> 05:23.170
You're failing History.
If you don't get

05:23.170 --> 05:24.620
your average up--
- I will.

05:24.620 --> 05:26.040
- Yeah, you will...

05:26.040 --> 05:28.620
I'm gonna help you.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.290
Now your principal says
you got to get at least a "B"

05:30.290 --> 05:33.380
on this final History project,
so you don't fail.

05:33.380 --> 05:35.120
So get it out.
Let's see what we got.

05:38.960 --> 05:41.250
You haven't even start--

05:43.420 --> 05:47.380
Okay...

05:47.380 --> 05:50.880
Okay. Let's um...

05:50.880 --> 05:52.380
Let's get started.

05:54.290 --> 05:56.120

07:08.420 --> 07:10.790
- You're an inspiration to me.

07:10.790 --> 07:13.210
I mean, when the kids at school
treat me like crap

07:13.210 --> 07:16.000
for being different,
your music gets me through.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.790
- Sweetheart, oh,

07:17.790 --> 07:20.500
It's so nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

07:28.920 --> 07:30.830

a bite to eat?

07:30.830 --> 07:33.670
- I don't think this baby's
gonna let me eat.

07:33.670 --> 07:36.420
My stomach's been doing
backflips since sound check.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.830

think they'll know?

07:45.830 --> 07:48.460

08:00.210 --> 08:02.210
- How you doing?

08:04.330 --> 08:07.420
"Sanctimonious and saccharine."

08:07.420 --> 08:08.670
- You took a risk.

08:08.670 --> 08:11.040
Sometimes that pays off.
Sometimes...

08:11.040 --> 08:13.040
- It blows up in your face?

08:13.040 --> 08:14.750
- Screw the critics.

08:14.750 --> 08:16.330
You poured your soul
into this album.

08:16.330 --> 08:17.710
If you love it,
it's all that matters.

08:17.710 --> 08:20.290
- That is not all that matters!

08:20.290 --> 08:21.750
My fans hated it!

08:21.750 --> 08:23.330
- They were thrown off.

08:23.330 --> 08:25.750
They're used to
a certain image of you.

08:25.750 --> 08:29.120
And the whole gospel got all...
- Gospel fans hate it the most.

08:29.120 --> 08:31.790
- We've got to keep
moving forward.

08:31.790 --> 08:35.210
For now, just try to focus
on something else.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.880
- I'm just saying, you know,

08:40.880 --> 08:42.460
don't feel like
you have to be there.

08:42.460 --> 08:44.880
- I want to be there, dumb ass.

08:44.880 --> 08:47.170
This is a big show for you.

08:47.170 --> 08:48.620
- Yeah, I know, but...

08:48.620 --> 08:51.000
- Oh, would you
stop cleaning up?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.420
I live like a pig, seriously.

08:52.420 --> 08:54.670
- It's just embarrassing,
you know.

08:54.670 --> 08:55.960
Thinking about you
out there watching me.

08:55.960 --> 08:59.380
- Well, I've seen
you play before.

08:59.380 --> 09:01.920
- That was before we were...

09:01.920 --> 09:03.710
- What?

09:07.040 --> 09:09.080
What are we?

09:09.080 --> 09:12.380
Will, stop.
It'll be fine.

09:12.380 --> 09:13.620
And, look, if it makes you
more comfortable,

09:13.620 --> 09:15.710
I can go in disguise.

09:15.710 --> 09:17.250
You know, something
like subtle face paint?

09:17.250 --> 09:19.080
Like I want Will?
You know?

09:19.080 --> 09:22.210
I'll just be mimicking your
moves during every song.

09:22.210 --> 09:23.920
And at the end of every one,
I'll be like,

09:23.920 --> 09:25.670
"Oh, my God!
That's my boyfriend!"

09:27.540 --> 09:30.670
- Is that what you are?

09:30.670 --> 09:33.920
- Yes, you dumb ass.

10:17.120 --> 10:18.750
What? Juliette?
- Hi, baby.

10:18.750 --> 10:20.120
- Wow, how long
have you been here?

10:20.120 --> 10:22.210
- Long enough.

10:22.210 --> 10:25.210
- So what do you think?
- Um...

10:25.210 --> 10:28.210
I think you sound beautiful.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.880
- Thank you.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.960
- But it's not a single.
Yet, okay?

10:33.960 --> 10:36.460
It just needs a little
bit more work.

10:36.460 --> 10:37.710
- Are you serious?

10:37.710 --> 10:39.710
- Look, with all due respect,

10:39.710 --> 10:42.960
I know that you guys have been
working really hard on this.

10:42.960 --> 10:45.920
- You've heard like three
different drafts of this,

10:45.920 --> 10:47.380
Juliette. If it needed
so much work,

10:47.380 --> 10:49.170
then why didn't you say
something before?

10:49.170 --> 10:51.620
- I should have,
and I'm sorry.

10:51.620 --> 10:54.290
I held back because I didn't
want to discourage you.

10:54.290 --> 10:56.290
Once you get out there
in the world,

10:56.290 --> 10:58.880
they're not gonna handle you
with kid gloves.

10:58.880 --> 11:01.120
Look what just happened to me.

11:01.120 --> 11:02.580
And I've been doing this
for years.

11:02.580 --> 11:04.670
- I know.

11:04.670 --> 11:07.580
You're lucky. You still have
time to fix this.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.500
- All right. So we got a slot
now for the other wing.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.710
- This looks nothing like
Amelia Earhart's plane.

11:15.710 --> 11:17.710
- Well, neither did hers
till it was finished.

11:17.710 --> 11:18.960
All right. You hold the wing.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.120
- I am holding it.
- Yeah, I know

11:21.120 --> 11:22.420
you're holding it,
but just hold it--

11:22.420 --> 11:24.040
Keep it steady.
Keep it right on there.

11:24.040 --> 11:25.460
- I am!
- You're not holding it still.

11:27.540 --> 11:28.710
- I'm tired.

11:28.710 --> 11:32.120
- Do you think I'm not tired?

11:32.120 --> 11:33.380
- Let's just stop then.

11:33.380 --> 11:35.080
- Sweetie, we're...

11:35.080 --> 11:37.580
We're trying to save
your grade here, all right?

11:43.290 --> 11:46.620
I'm not trying to be hard on you
for no reason here.

11:46.620 --> 11:48.290
I just need to know that
this is getting through to you,

11:48.290 --> 11:49.880
all right?

11:49.880 --> 11:51.420
School is your job.

11:51.420 --> 11:53.120
You gotta take this seriously.

11:53.120 --> 11:55.120
- Yeah. Whatever you want.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.290
- No, baby, it's not for me.
It's for you.

11:57.290 --> 11:58.460
You want to do
this year over again?

11:58.460 --> 12:02.080
- Why not? What's it matter?

12:02.080 --> 12:03.920
We could all die at any time!

12:08.790 --> 12:11.500
- Hey!

12:13.420 --> 12:18.120
- What?

12:18.120 --> 12:20.460
- You can't just say something
like that and run off, baby.

12:23.170 --> 12:25.000
You okay?

12:25.000 --> 12:28.330
- I'm just tired.
I need to sleep.

12:32.580 --> 12:35.170
- I know none of this seems
important, but it is.

12:35.170 --> 12:38.880
Because we just got to keep
moving on, you know.

12:40.620 --> 12:43.290
- I get it.

12:43.290 --> 12:45.080
- You go on to bed.
I'll finish it.

12:52.920 --> 12:54.670
(sighs)

13:04.460 --> 13:06.710
- Here, let me hold it.

13:06.710 --> 13:08.670
You want to go over your speech
one more time?

13:08.670 --> 13:10.620
- That's okay.

13:10.620 --> 13:13.540
- All right. There you go.

13:13.540 --> 13:17.420
Hey, you're gonna do great.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.460
(school bell rings)

13:44.960 --> 13:46.620
- (sighs)

13:59.790 --> 14:01.960
- You hear from Maddie?

14:01.960 --> 14:04.670
- No. Maybe I shouldn't
have said anything.

14:04.670 --> 14:06.000
- No. You said what
you really think.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.500
It's up to her to listen or not.

14:07.500 --> 14:09.880
- I just took her by surprise.

14:09.880 --> 14:11.580
All she's used to hearing
from this producer

14:11.580 --> 14:13.460
is how brilliant she is.

14:13.460 --> 14:16.040
It's like, Maddie, you're 17.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.210
- I'm so glad no one ever
recorded me at 17.

14:18.210 --> 14:22.710
- Right. It'd be
a really easy fix too.

14:22.710 --> 14:24.080
You know, It just needs more...

14:27.290 --> 14:29.420
This is what she's singing now.

14:31.420 --> 14:34.380
♪ Got me racing my heart now
I'm fading out ♪

14:37.170 --> 14:41.540
♪ I'm waiting to be saved
by your tidal wave ♪

14:41.540 --> 14:44.750
♪ Take me away
t-t-take me away ♪

14:44.750 --> 14:47.330
I would have her pop the chorus
up to a higher note.

14:47.330 --> 14:49.750
It just needs a stronger hook,
like...

14:49.750 --> 14:51.420
♪ Got me racing my heart now ♪

14:51.420 --> 14:54.750
♪ I'm fading out ♪

14:54.750 --> 14:59.080
♪ I'm waiting to be
saved by your tidal wave ♪

14:59.080 --> 15:02.080
♪ Take me away,
t-t-take me away ♪

15:05.420 --> 15:07.080
- Sounds like you have it.

15:07.080 --> 15:09.330
- And the track needs
to be stronger.

15:09.330 --> 15:11.620
Maybe some pop programing
in there.

15:11.620 --> 15:14.420
And the energy just
needs to grab you.

15:14.420 --> 15:15.830
- Maybe instead of trying
to explain it to her,

15:15.830 --> 15:18.000
she just needs to hear
what you hear.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.580
- You know,
you're not just pretty.

15:19.580 --> 15:22.540
You're smart too.

15:22.540 --> 15:24.210
I like it.

15:28.210 --> 15:29.750
(text message rings)

15:40.620 --> 15:44.000
- Hey! Want me
to read your palm?

15:44.000 --> 15:45.380
- Sure.

15:54.710 --> 15:57.290
- Interesting.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.710
- How much?

16:00.710 --> 16:02.170
- Get lost.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.000
Hey, watch this.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.210
Dad? Dad, is that you?

16:08.210 --> 16:10.540
Wait! I need money for college!

16:10.540 --> 16:13.170
Hey! Hey, I'm talking to you!

16:19.380 --> 16:21.500
- Hey! Bitch!
Come back here!

16:21.500 --> 16:23.380
- Come on! Come on!

16:26.290 --> 16:28.290
- Oh my God!

16:28.290 --> 16:30.250
That was insane!

16:30.250 --> 16:31.670
- That was like the dumbest
thing I could have done...

16:31.670 --> 16:33.670
- No, it was so cool.

16:33.670 --> 16:36.120
- It's wonderful to make your
acquaintance, my fairy child.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.620
My name's Liv.
- I'm Daphne.

16:38.620 --> 16:40.040
- Does your school make you
wear that outfit?

16:40.040 --> 16:41.830
- Yep.

16:41.830 --> 16:44.330
- It's ugly as hell.
No wonder you're ditching.

16:44.330 --> 16:46.420
You want me to finish
your fortune, inside?

16:46.420 --> 16:48.710
- Um, where are we?

16:48.710 --> 16:51.250
- Dude, this is where we crash.

16:51.250 --> 16:52.710
Until the cops kick us out.
Come on.

16:58.460 --> 17:00.120
Thanks

17:02.460 --> 17:04.210
- You live here?

17:04.210 --> 17:07.330
- Apologies for the mess.
Maid didn't come today.

17:07.330 --> 17:08.920
- Whoah.

17:08.920 --> 17:10.420
That's just Kyle.

17:10.420 --> 17:12.080
He sleeps through anything,
you're good.

17:13.880 --> 17:15.460
- Who are all these people?

17:15.460 --> 17:18.620
- People nobody cares about.

17:18.620 --> 17:22.250
Okay, so...
come on.

17:24.540 --> 17:26.710
This, this is your head line.

17:26.710 --> 17:28.330
See how long and straight it is?

17:28.330 --> 17:29.460
That means that you think
things through,

17:29.460 --> 17:31.420
and you stick to your goals.

17:31.420 --> 17:33.420
- Yeah, I guess I used
to be like that.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.920
- Not anymore?

17:35.920 --> 17:37.250
- Well, I mean,
I completely bailed

17:37.250 --> 17:39.170
on this Amelia Earhart project

17:39.170 --> 17:41.000
which was like 50% of my grade.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.670
- Grade's just a number,
though, right?

17:42.670 --> 17:45.000
If you learn something,
that's what matters.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.750
Hey, Sherri.
Hey, Jayden. Hi.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.170
(baby babbles)

17:54.170 --> 17:56.250
Oh, munchkin.

17:56.250 --> 17:58.830

He didn't nap today.

should I wear?

18:49.500 --> 18:51.290
- Uh...they're exactly the same.

18:51.290 --> 18:53.540
- No, they're not the same!

18:53.540 --> 18:56.290
I got to look cool.
- Oh, for Zach?

18:56.290 --> 18:58.620
- Shut up. I'm completely
nervous about this.

18:58.620 --> 19:00.120
- (laughs)

19:00.120 --> 19:01.460
Well, you must really like him.

19:01.460 --> 19:03.290
- More than I should.

19:03.290 --> 19:04.330
- So what are you worried about?

19:04.330 --> 19:06.580
You're not that bad live.

19:08.540 --> 19:10.170
All right, you need
to calm down.

19:10.170 --> 19:11.380
You're gonna be great, okay?

19:11.380 --> 19:12.500
Yeah, right, my boyfriend's

19:12.500 --> 19:14.040
only a certified genius.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.620
Who's literally one of Forbes

19:15.620 --> 19:16.750
most powerful people
in the world.

19:16.750 --> 19:18.120
- And you, my friend,

19:18.120 --> 19:19.920
are the guy that can
walk out onstage.

19:19.920 --> 19:23.670
And make 1,000 people dance
and scream and feel.

19:23.670 --> 19:26.290
All right, Zach Welles will
never be able to do that.

19:29.880 --> 19:33.290
- So, if we really want to
disrupt the music industry,

19:33.290 --> 19:35.170
we need to shift our focus.

19:35.170 --> 19:37.750
We need to start thinking about
mindshare over profits.

19:37.750 --> 19:39.290
- Mindshare?

19:39.290 --> 19:41.000
- I thought we were trying
to increase revenue.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.420
Is that what we're trying to do?
Disrupt the industry?

19:42.420 --> 19:43.750
- It sounds weird. I know.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.330
but disruption can be
a good thing.

19:45.330 --> 19:47.080
I mean, look what Uber
did to the taxi industry.

19:47.080 --> 19:48.460
- What is a mindshare?
What is that?

19:48.460 --> 19:49.750
- It's the currency of
attention,

19:49.750 --> 19:51.580
capturing eyeballs and ears.

19:51.580 --> 19:52.880
- How about actual currency?

19:56.920 --> 20:00.330
- Look, I believe we can make
this company profitable again.

20:00.330 --> 20:02.540
But it's not gonna happen
by doing things

20:02.540 --> 20:04.670
the way that you have
in the past.

20:04.670 --> 20:06.540
Okay, that model is just
no longer effective.

20:06.540 --> 20:08.880
- Sorry, I got to take
this real quick, Zach.

20:08.880 --> 20:11.540
Hello?

20:11.540 --> 20:13.920
Uh, yeah, dropped her
off this morning.

20:13.920 --> 20:17.290
Oh, my God.

20:17.290 --> 20:21.080
All right, yeah.
Okay, thank you.

20:21.080 --> 20:23.880
Daphne's missing.

20:23.880 --> 20:25.080
I gotta go.

20:25.080 --> 20:26.710
- Please...
- Yeah, thank you.

20:28.420 --> 20:29.960
- (sighs)

20:54.330 --> 20:56.170
- It's Daphne. Leave a message.

20:57.710 --> 20:59.580
(phone rings)

21:02.080 --> 21:03.580
- Did you find her?

21:03.580 --> 21:05.120
- Yeah, she's fine.
She's here.

21:05.120 --> 21:07.420
- Oh, my God, thank you.

21:07.420 --> 21:10.000
- Where are you?

21:10.000 --> 21:12.040
- I'm on my way home.
- Okay.

21:12.040 --> 21:13.960
- You must love this.

21:13.960 --> 21:15.710
- Are you kidding me?

21:15.710 --> 21:19.290
I practically had a heart attack
when dad called me!

21:19.290 --> 21:21.880
After that guy stalked mom?

21:21.880 --> 21:23.290
I'm just so glad that
you're okay, Daphne.

21:31.380 --> 21:33.580
- Daphne!

21:33.580 --> 21:35.960
- She went upstairs.
I gotta go to the studio.

21:35.960 --> 21:38.880
- Yeah, go.
- All right. I love you.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.620
- I love you.

21:46.120 --> 21:48.710
Where the hell were you?

21:48.710 --> 21:53.580
- Nowhere. I was
just walking around.

21:53.580 --> 21:55.420
- You can't do that, all right?

21:55.420 --> 21:56.540
You cannot just
run off like that.

21:56.540 --> 21:57.920
- I missed one day!

21:57.920 --> 21:59.460
Some kids don't even
go to school.

21:59.460 --> 22:00.920
- I don't care
what other kids do.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.540
You don't answer my phone call.

22:02.540 --> 22:04.250
You don't answer my texts.

22:04.250 --> 22:05.960
What about your project, huh?

22:05.960 --> 22:08.620
- I'll just retake the year.
I don't care.

22:11.290 --> 22:12.880
- You got to help me out here,
all right?

22:12.880 --> 22:14.710
Because I don't understand
what is going on.

22:14.710 --> 22:16.790
This is not you, Daphne.
This is not who you are!

22:16.790 --> 22:20.170
- You don't know me.
I'm not Maddie!

22:20.170 --> 22:22.500
- I never said you...
I don't think you are.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.880
- You try to make us family,
but we're not!

22:36.290 --> 22:37.540
- Hey.
- Ah!

22:37.540 --> 22:39.290
Sorry. The door was unlocked.

22:39.290 --> 22:41.670
- I didn't hear you come in.

22:41.670 --> 22:44.620
(cell phone rings)

22:47.920 --> 22:50.920
- Uh, it's...

22:50.920 --> 22:53.500
- Turn it off.

22:53.500 --> 22:54.920
- All right.

22:58.920 --> 23:02.580
♪ Knowing that I'm
certain to be ♪

23:02.580 --> 23:03.790
♪ Saved ♪

23:07.000 --> 23:10.540
- Did you hear how much
better you sounded?

23:10.540 --> 23:14.750
- Juliette, I'm sorry.
This version is just not me.

23:14.750 --> 23:17.830
- Okay. I get it. It's new.

23:17.830 --> 23:20.210
But I hope you'll
at least give it a chance.

23:20.210 --> 23:22.710
- I thought that's
what I just did.

23:22.710 --> 23:24.790
- Why don't you take it home.

23:24.790 --> 23:27.170
Listen to it a few times
before you make your decision.

23:27.170 --> 23:29.250
Because this single can make
or break your album.

23:29.250 --> 23:31.420
- I really appreciate
you looking out for me.

23:31.420 --> 23:34.710
I really do, but I have
been waiting so long

23:34.710 --> 23:36.380
to make my music my way.

23:36.380 --> 23:38.460
- Maddie, this is
still your song.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.960
But songs evolve and sometimes
you have to just let them.

23:40.960 --> 23:42.210
- But this didn't
evolve on its own.

23:42.210 --> 23:43.790
You changed it!

23:43.790 --> 23:45.330
And I'm sorry, but I
liked it the way it was.

23:45.330 --> 23:47.460
- Of course, you do!
You're attached to it.

23:47.460 --> 23:49.290
But sometimes that
holds you back, okay?

23:49.290 --> 23:51.670
When you were too close
to see clearly.

23:51.670 --> 23:52.830
- You don't think
I'm seeing clearly?

23:52.830 --> 23:54.710
- It happens to all of us.

23:54.710 --> 23:58.120
I am trying to make sure that
you don't get hurt here.

23:58.120 --> 24:00.710
Okay, I have been doing this
so much longer than you.

24:00.710 --> 24:03.880
I know what works
and what doesn't.

24:03.880 --> 24:05.500
- Well, then...
- What?

24:05.500 --> 24:07.210
- No. I should just go.

24:07.210 --> 24:10.120
- Maddie, you can say
what you need to say to me.

24:10.120 --> 24:13.080
- Then why didn't
your album work?

24:15.790 --> 24:19.500
- It is a completely
different situation.

24:19.500 --> 24:20.960
You're not established yet.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.460
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't--

24:23.460 --> 24:25.750
- No, it's fine.

24:25.750 --> 24:28.040
You don't want to sing it,
don't sing it.

24:28.040 --> 24:29.670

call it a day.

Daphne?

26:10.330 --> 26:12.120
- I'm failing History.

26:12.120 --> 26:14.960
Which, according to my stepdad,
is like the end of the world.

26:14.960 --> 26:17.120
- What's it like
according to you?

26:17.120 --> 26:21.290
- I mean, I know it's not good.

26:21.290 --> 26:23.290
And I should probably care more,

26:23.290 --> 26:27.670
since it's about my future
or whatever.

26:27.670 --> 26:31.290
It's like I don't even
want to be here.

26:31.290 --> 26:34.540
- Here? In therapy?

26:34.540 --> 26:36.120
- Anywhere.

26:39.460 --> 26:42.460
- So what do you think?

26:42.460 --> 26:44.380
- Daphne's showing signs
of major depression.

26:44.380 --> 26:48.830
- God, come on now.
She just lost her mom.

26:48.830 --> 26:50.880
- It can be triggered by loss.

26:50.880 --> 26:52.920
But it's different from grief.

26:52.920 --> 26:55.540
Grief subsides.
Depression is persistent.

26:55.540 --> 26:58.960
And it often comes with feelings
of emptiness or worthlessness.

26:58.960 --> 27:02.960
- I know about depression.

27:02.960 --> 27:06.170
I was just hoping she's
getting better, you know.

27:06.170 --> 27:09.290
I guess I needed her to.

27:09.290 --> 27:11.120
So what do we do?

27:11.120 --> 27:13.960
- I'm going to suggest Daphne
come see me twice a week.

27:13.960 --> 27:16.080
I can teach her
coping techniques.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.420
Help her identify her feelings
and work through them.

27:18.420 --> 27:21.460
- What about home?
What do I do?

27:21.460 --> 27:24.750
- Love her.

27:24.750 --> 27:28.460
Try to resist
the impulse to fix it.

27:28.460 --> 27:32.080
Let her push you away
if she needs to.

27:32.080 --> 27:35.790
Let her know
you'll still be there.

27:41.500 --> 27:44.080
- Okay.
- Here we go.

27:45.960 --> 27:47.500
- You don't wanna wait
till we get home?

27:47.500 --> 27:48.920
- It's like ripping off
a Band-Aid.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.120
Just gotta do it.

27:55.380 --> 27:57.500
Just remember, whatever it says,

27:57.500 --> 28:00.330
we'll deal with it.

28:00.330 --> 28:01.920
It doesn't change anything
between us.

28:33.670 --> 28:35.330
It's okay.

28:39.710 --> 28:41.920
It's okay.
It doesn't matter.

28:43.080 --> 28:44.960
I still love you.

28:52.460 --> 28:54.120
- You know, I really thought
nothing could be worse

28:54.120 --> 28:56.670
than not knowing.

28:56.670 --> 29:00.790
- Sorry, man.

29:00.790 --> 29:03.920
- I was so stupid. I just...

29:03.920 --> 29:08.500
I got attached to the thought
of me and her and the baby.

29:08.500 --> 29:11.960
- Well, can't it still be
you and her and the baby?

29:11.960 --> 29:15.250
- And him?

29:15.250 --> 29:19.040
Every time I look at her,
I see them together.

29:19.040 --> 29:22.670
- You think she still
has feelings for him?

29:22.670 --> 29:26.250
- I don't know.
Either way, I'm screwed.

29:26.250 --> 29:29.500
I swore to her the test
wouldn't matter.

29:29.500 --> 29:32.250
Why can't I just man up
and get over it?

29:32.250 --> 29:35.080
- Because it's not fair.

29:35.080 --> 29:39.790
We all get sold this fantasy
that life's gonna be easy.

29:39.790 --> 29:41.790
Hurts like hell
when you learn the truth.

29:41.790 --> 29:43.880
- Yeah, no kidding.

29:43.880 --> 29:47.330
- It's just you can't push
that kind of pain away.

29:47.330 --> 29:50.960
You gotta own it,

29:50.960 --> 29:53.120
deal with it every day.

29:53.120 --> 29:56.920
That's being a man.

29:56.920 --> 29:59.620
- Yeah.

29:59.620 --> 30:01.210
- Look, Gunnar, if you really
want to be with her,

30:01.210 --> 30:02.790
you'll find a way.

30:02.790 --> 30:06.460
- I just don't wanna
mess it up again, man.

30:06.460 --> 30:08.040
I failed her so many times.

30:08.040 --> 30:11.960
- Of course, you have
and she's failed you.

30:11.960 --> 30:16.670
I mean, that's what people do.
They fail each other.

30:16.670 --> 30:21.290

Fail better.

- Okay. Well, full disclosure,
I can tell which one is yours.

30:54.420 --> 30:57.000
- Really? That totally ruins it.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.500
You're supposed to be blind
and be able to be objective.

30:59.500 --> 31:03.380

here's your lesson.

what is making it even mean?

31:37.170 --> 31:40.330
Being universally liked?
It's impossible.

31:40.330 --> 31:42.880

gonna be that bestselling

31:42.880 --> 31:44.670
top of the charts, whatever.

31:44.670 --> 31:47.380
But it doesn't need to be.

putting something out

31:55.120 --> 31:57.460
you can't stand behind.

32:05.420 --> 32:07.170

32:35.170 --> 32:37.170
- Why?

I don't know. Maybe people would
like Juliette's version better.

33:19.960 --> 33:21.880
Clay did. I don't know.

33:21.880 --> 33:24.080

- I just...

33:28.710 --> 33:31.540
I wish I could ask mom.

33:31.540 --> 33:35.380
She was so true to her voice.

33:35.380 --> 33:39.330
- Yeah, she was.

33:39.330 --> 33:42.500
But she made some
compromises too.

33:42.500 --> 33:43.670
Especially when she started out.

33:43.670 --> 33:45.250
- So you think I should...

33:45.250 --> 33:46.790
- I can't tell you
what's right for you.

33:46.790 --> 33:47.880
I'm just saying that,
when you make music,

33:47.880 --> 33:50.080
you never really do it alone.

33:50.080 --> 33:51.330
Your band, your producer,

33:51.330 --> 33:54.250
your engineers, your audience.

his judgment here.

34:58.920 --> 35:01.120
He's so protective
of her legacy.

35:01.120 --> 35:02.290
He's afraid to let
the label evolve

needs to to survive.

35:07.040 --> 35:08.790
about finding another
job for him.

35:10.290 --> 35:11.920
- Another job?

35:11.920 --> 35:14.170
- I just don't see
how he's useful to us

35:14.170 --> 35:16.420
in his current position.
And if he didn't want

35:16.420 --> 35:17.920
to stay on, we can get him
the best possible package.

35:17.920 --> 35:20.120
- You want to let him go,
is what you want.

35:20.120 --> 35:23.170
- Something like that would
be your call, totally.

35:23.170 --> 35:26.880
I'm just voicing a concern.

35:26.880 --> 35:29.250
Just give it some thought.

35:33.710 --> 35:34.880
(text message rings)

35:40.170 --> 35:42.170
- Hey, it's Hallie.
(echoing)

35:42.170 --> 35:44.830
I just wanted to see
how you're doing.

35:44.830 --> 35:47.790
I haven't heard from you
since the party.

35:56.120 --> 35:58.460
- Are you okay?

35:58.460 --> 36:00.920
- Ye--Fine.

36:00.920 --> 36:03.830
- Hey
- Hey, thanks for meeting me.

36:03.830 --> 36:05.880
I felt like we should talk.

36:05.880 --> 36:09.380
- Yeah. I've been
feeling really bad.

36:09.380 --> 36:12.710
- No. I should not have pushed
you that hard, okay?

36:12.710 --> 36:15.380
Sometimes I get a little
caught up in myself,

36:15.380 --> 36:18.420
not to shock you.

36:18.420 --> 36:20.000
I feel like for our friendship,

36:20.000 --> 36:21.790
it might be better if I just
backed off a little bit.

36:21.790 --> 36:24.290
- Juliette...
- Professionally.

36:24.290 --> 36:26.540
- I want to use your version.
- Really?

36:26.540 --> 36:30.290
- Yeah.
- What changed your mind?

36:30.290 --> 36:32.790
- I listened.

Just let me get this out.

38:17.880 --> 38:20.500
You're the best person
I've ever known.

38:20.500 --> 38:22.540
That's why it hurt so much when
we opened that envelope.

38:22.540 --> 38:26.830
It still hurts,
but I can take it.

38:26.830 --> 38:29.750
What I can't take is losing you.

38:29.750 --> 38:31.580
Now I won't promise
not to mess up.

38:31.580 --> 38:34.750
Because I will.
It's like a guarantee.

39:11.040 --> 39:12.790
- Something tastes a little bit
different about it.

39:12.790 --> 39:16.670
- Really?
- Little bit.

39:16.670 --> 39:19.250
- Mom used more garlic.
- Mm-hmm. Hey.

39:19.250 --> 39:20.380
- I made Silly Noodle Casserole.

39:20.380 --> 39:21.540
- Ta-da!

39:25.120 --> 39:27.670
You know, I never really got
what was so silly about this.

39:27.670 --> 39:29.540
What was that, huh?
- I don't even know.

39:29.540 --> 39:31.040
We just always called it that.

39:31.040 --> 39:32.620
- Really? What about you?
What do you think?

39:32.620 --> 39:34.420
- I'm not hungry.

39:34.420 --> 39:36.000
- What? Are you serious?

39:36.000 --> 39:37.380
We just spent so long
making this, Daphne.

39:37.380 --> 39:38.880
- You been in your room
all afternoon.

39:38.880 --> 39:40.000
Scarlett and Gunnar
are coming over.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.330
I know they want to see you.

39:41.330 --> 39:43.670
- Well, I don't
want to see them.

39:43.670 --> 39:47.290
- Come on. Let's talk
about it a little bit.

39:47.290 --> 39:48.500
- Screw you!

40:18.000 --> 40:20.460
- It's okay.
You don't have to talk to me.

40:23.620 --> 40:26.330
You're angry. I get that.

40:26.330 --> 40:29.500
I keep trying to make
everything okay.

40:29.500 --> 40:32.920
And it's not.

40:32.920 --> 40:36.790
It's not for me either.

40:36.790 --> 40:39.460
It's not for any of us.

40:39.460 --> 40:43.620
And I don't know what
to do about that.

40:43.620 --> 40:46.750
But for now, maybe it's okay,

40:46.750 --> 40:50.620
not being okay.

40:50.620 --> 40:54.540
- We love you, Daph, so much.

40:56.040 --> 40:59.210
- We know you love us too.

40:59.210 --> 41:02.500
Even when you can't stand us.

41:02.500 --> 41:03.880
- We're family.

41:06.250 --> 41:08.000
- One thing you need to know is

41:08.000 --> 41:09.500
that whatever
you're going through,

41:09.500 --> 41:14.460
we're gonna be right here
for you, always,

41:14.460 --> 41:16.790
no matter what.
