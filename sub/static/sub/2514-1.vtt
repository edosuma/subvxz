<i>Right after the break, we're</i>
<i>going to interview David Kern,</i>

00:46.147 --> 00:48.647
<i>who climbed the highest</i>
<i>mountain in the world,</i>
<i>Mount Everest,</i>

00:48.649 --> 00:51.216
<i>but he's gate...</i>
<i>I mean, he's gay.</i>

00:51.218 --> 00:53.085
<i>Excuse me. He's blind.</i>

00:53.087 --> 00:57.723
<i>More teens</i>
<i>are having fuck...</i>
<i>Having luck, rather.</i>

00:57.725 --> 01:00.592
<i>One way to do a turkey call</i>
<i>is with this gobbler...</i>

01:00.594 --> 01:03.595
<i>that allows the air to</i>
<i>vibrate. You should try it.</i>

01:03.597 --> 01:05.197
<i>I'd love to.</i>
<i>Go ahead.</i>
<i>I want to see this.</i>

01:05.199 --> 01:07.266
<i>No, no.</i>

01:07.268 --> 01:08.467
<i>That just wasn't right.</i>

01:08.469 --> 01:10.135
<i>It's a beautiful Memorial Day.</i>

01:10.137 --> 01:11.570
<i>We have people</i>
<i>out here sunbathing.</i>

01:11.572 --> 01:13.672
<i>We have people</i>
<i>tossing the ball around.</i>

01:13.674 --> 01:17.242
<i>And we really want to advise</i>
<i>that you guys try to make it...</i>

01:17.244 --> 01:18.644
<i>I'm a bird, bitch!</i>
<i>A safe Memorial Day.</i>

01:18.646 --> 01:22.081
<i>Okay, dude.</i>
<i>Goddamn it, man!</i>

01:22.083 --> 01:23.582
<i>Well, I'm sure</i>
<i>you needed it, Annie.</i>

01:23.584 --> 01:26.185
<i>Did you get many spankings</i>
<i>as a kid?</i>

01:26.187 --> 01:28.654
<i>As a kid? No. I... Oh!</i>

01:28.656 --> 01:32.191
Whoa.
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

01:32.193 --> 01:34.393
<i>Susenko Energy is announcing</i>
<i>a proposal to jack off...</i>

01:34.395 --> 01:37.696
<i>What is your comment</i>
<i>on the results</i>
<i>of the proceedings?</i>

01:37.698 --> 01:44.703
<i>What really happened</i>
<i>on that Thursday</i>
<i>here at Central High...</i>

01:44.705 --> 01:47.206
<i>that led to Tim Johnson's de...</i>

01:47.208 --> 01:50.576
<i>What the </i> fuck <i> was that?</i>
<i>Shit!</i>

01:50.578 --> 01:54.379
<i>God, I'm dying</i>
<i>in this fuckin' country-ass,</i>
<i>fucked-up town.</i>

01:54.381 --> 01:58.183
<i>It looks like Reuben</i>

<i>and here comes...</i>

01:58.185 --> 02:00.452
<i>No! No!</i>
<i>Aaah!</i>

02:00.454 --> 02:04.256
<i>An infestation</i>
<i>of Canadian Brown Finches,</i>
<i>which is a small bird...</i>

02:04.258 --> 02:06.658
<i>I guess I should have</i>

02:11.465 --> 02:13.632
<i>We now send it over</i>

02:13.634 --> 02:16.835
<i>Hey, Joe, I'm here</i>
<i>at the A.S.P.C.A., where I'm...</i>

02:16.837 --> 02:23.175
<i>I think she is.</i>
<i>Meghan, are you okay?</i>

02:23.177 --> 02:24.710
<i>Okay, Meghan...</i>
<i>We'll get a medic</i>
<i>over to her.</i>

02:24.712 --> 02:25.777
<i>Yeah.</i>

02:28.281 --> 02:30.816
Thank you so much
for coming with me.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.352
You're my girl.
Team.
Right. Team.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.420
They're not going to bring up
the cat thing, right?

02:35.422 --> 02:38.624
That was 100 years ago.
No one looks at those
YouTube things anymore.

02:38.626 --> 02:40.392
Yeah, right.
Relax, Meghan.

02:40.394 --> 02:43.529
Relax?
Ooh. It's the network.

02:43.531 --> 02:46.632
It's a big step up from local,
but you are ready.
Oh, I'm ready.

02:46.634 --> 02:49.668
Just be yourself.
No, I'm going to be exactly
what they want me to be.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.570
"Anchor."

02:51.572 --> 02:54.573
It is both a noun and a verb.

02:54.575 --> 02:57.576
A reliable or principal support,

02:57.578 --> 03:00.846
but in action,
it means to hold fast.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.481
Hmm.
Mmm.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.550
I believe I can do that
for your viewers...

03:04.552 --> 03:10.255
be the center,
and hold them... steady.

03:10.257 --> 03:12.357
Tell us more about yourself.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.860
Well, I was raised in Texas.

03:14.862 --> 03:18.597
I studied journalism
at the University of Texas.

03:18.599 --> 03:21.567
I love to read.
I'm a voracious reader.

03:21.569 --> 03:24.236
Mostly historical fiction.

03:24.238 --> 03:27.739
Have you read
Toni Morrison's <i> Beloved?</i>

03:27.741 --> 03:30.709
- Of course.
- Good answer.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.679
My role models
include my parents,
which I know is corny,

03:33.681 --> 03:35.981
but they've
been married 35 years...

03:35.983 --> 03:40.452
and, um, I am recently engaged.

03:40.454 --> 03:43.855
We like that.
We'll have a decision
in two weeks.

03:43.857 --> 03:47.859
There isn't any...
dirt in your past
that we should know about?

03:49.229 --> 03:50.629
Skeletons?

03:51.564 --> 03:53.465
Bones of any kind?

03:54.467 --> 03:55.901
I'm a good girl.

03:59.472 --> 04:00.906
Morning, Meghan Miles.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.774
Be well.
Good day. Good day.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.676
Hey, looking good,
Chuck Rogers.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.245
Five minutes to air, people.

04:06.247 --> 04:11.016
I just spoke to my source
inside the network.
And?

04:11.018 --> 04:13.418
Its down to you
and Wendy Chang.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.254
The decision
should come down today.

04:15.256 --> 04:16.788
Don't be nervous.
Don't be nervous?

04:16.790 --> 04:18.257
You shouldn't have told me.
Breathe.

04:23.264 --> 04:24.896
Oh, gosh, hang on.

04:24.898 --> 04:27.499
This is Meghan Miles.

04:27.501 --> 04:30.302
Meghan, you dirty hooker.

04:30.304 --> 04:32.871
Rosie, stop.
I'm about to go on air.
<i>Okay, good.</i>

04:32.873 --> 04:35.474
But be advised that we
are going out tonight
to celebrate.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.276
Honey, I didn't get the job yet.

04:37.278 --> 04:39.478
- Minor detail.
- I don't know.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.380
It's been a really long week.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.781
<i>Don't be a cock-blocker.</i>

04:42.783 --> 04:45.951
"I will not block the cock."

04:45.953 --> 04:47.986
You know what? Hang on.
I have another call.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.722
It could be the network.

04:50.724 --> 04:53.392
- This is Meghan Miles.
<i>- Meg, honey.</i>

04:53.394 --> 04:56.495
- Hey, Mama.
- We just saw
your last newscast.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.630
<i>You did such a good job.</i>

04:58.632 --> 05:01.800
Although that outfit
was a little revealing
by about a button.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.068
Really?

05:03.070 --> 05:05.737
I've been telling wardrobe
to watch out for it.

05:05.739 --> 05:08.407
Thank you for the feedback.
<i>Well, we love you.</i>

05:08.409 --> 05:10.876
Say hi to Kyle.
<i>I love you too.</i>

05:10.878 --> 05:13.412
Talk soon.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.314
Fine. I will not block
the cock.

05:15.316 --> 05:17.783
Still me, hon.

05:17.785 --> 05:20.352
I'm so sorry, Mama.

05:20.354 --> 05:22.754
This is KZLA <i> Live at 5:00</i>
<i>Eyewitness News.</i>

05:24.558 --> 05:25.691
- With Jane Rain, weather.
- Camera one.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.025
Ready, Chuck?
Let's do this.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.694
Chuck Rogers, sports.

05:28.696 --> 05:31.496
And Chopper Steve, traffic.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.366
Will you stop it?
My mother's gonna kill me.

05:34.368 --> 05:37.669
<i>Good evening, Los Angeles.</i>
<i>I'm Meghan Miles.</i>

05:38.939 --> 05:41.506
<i>The day is upon us.</i>

<i>Chopper Steve, can you tell us</i>

05:56.090 --> 05:58.690
<i>Oh. Doing great.</i>
<i>Fantastic.</i>

05:58.692 --> 05:59.791
<i>Chopper Steve,</i>
<i>are you texting?</i>

05:59.793 --> 06:03.729
<i>Who's gonna</i>

06:08.635 --> 06:11.603

06:11.605 --> 06:15.374
<i>Oh, </i> steer clear.

06:15.376 --> 06:16.942
<i>I got that one, Meghan Miles.</i>

06:16.944 --> 06:21.880

<i>We'll check back with you</i>

06:21.882 --> 06:24.783

<i>What? Did my check bounce?</i>

06:24.785 --> 06:26.551
<i>Aw. Sorry.</i>

06:26.553 --> 06:27.753
<i>Okay. Bye now, Chopper Steve.</i>

06:27.755 --> 06:29.454
<i>Fly safe.</i>

06:29.456 --> 06:32.524
<i>Real smooth, Chopper Steve.</i>
<i>Fuckin' loser.</i>

06:32.526 --> 06:34.559
<i>I should just crash this thing</i>

06:34.561 --> 06:37.095

<i>We can still hear you.</i>
<i>Your mike is on.</i>

07:05.959 --> 07:07.626
Great.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.895
Chopper Steve...
Is he on his meds?

07:09.897 --> 07:11.897
Short answer, no.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.632
Did anybody call?
Did you get any e-mails?

07:13.634 --> 07:15.867
No. No. Calm down.
Any text messages
I need to know about?

07:15.869 --> 07:18.804
Calm down.
I'm going to hear
from them,

07:18.806 --> 07:20.505
and I'll call you at home.

07:23.676 --> 07:25.744
I can't wait
to get my drink on.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.813
And get my dance on.
And...

07:27.815 --> 07:29.214
Just those two things.
Denise.

07:29.216 --> 07:30.916
What?

07:30.918 --> 07:33.118
Meghan.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.455
Meghan! Meghan Miles.

07:36.457 --> 07:38.590
Either she's not home
or she's ignoring us.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.792
Or she's incapacitated,
tied up...

07:40.794 --> 07:43.195
or maybe she had a stroke
or a seizure or something.

07:43.197 --> 07:45.664
Denise, this is Brentwood.
Nothing bad
ever happens in Brent...

07:45.666 --> 07:47.833
Oh, my God, O.J. Simpson.
I just remembered that.
Yeah.

07:47.835 --> 07:50.502
Meghan!
It's open.

07:50.504 --> 07:54.072
Honey, you are not back
on the farm in Texas.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.007
You cannot just
leave your door unlocked.

07:56.009 --> 07:59.077
Hey, party girls.
What's up?

07:59.079 --> 08:00.178
What do you want to drink?

08:00.180 --> 08:02.581
I have tap water.
Wait.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.150
Wait, what's going on?
Where's Kyle?

08:05.152 --> 08:07.519
He's at the supermarket.

08:07.521 --> 08:10.121
And, um, where's all your stuff?

08:10.123 --> 08:12.724
Oh. Um...

08:12.726 --> 08:14.926
Kyle took it all
to the supermarket.

08:17.530 --> 08:19.698
The <i> supermercado.</i>

08:22.034 --> 08:23.902
He's gone.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.904
He, um...

08:25.906 --> 08:27.806
He said he didn't know
who I was anymore,

08:27.808 --> 08:29.875
and then he left
and he took everything.

08:29.877 --> 08:32.744
That's so weird.
When is he coming back?

08:34.246 --> 08:36.815
Why did you not tell us?

08:36.817 --> 08:38.984
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

08:38.986 --> 08:41.753
Rosie, I just...

08:41.755 --> 08:46.725
Yeah, but, honey,
we're your friends.
We're not gonna judge you.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.288
Hang on. It's Dan.

08:49.763 --> 08:55.133
<i>Meghan, don't freak out,</i>
<i>but they're going</i>
<i>with Wendy Chang.</i>

08:56.903 --> 08:58.937
<i>Meghan, are you okay?</i>

08:58.939 --> 09:02.007
Chang!

09:02.009 --> 09:04.776
This is such a terrible time
for Kyle to not be here.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.711
Denise, shut up.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.947
They gave it to Wendy Chang.

09:08.949 --> 09:11.082
She's an anchor
in San Francisco.

09:11.084 --> 09:13.585
There you go, honey.
That's a diversity hire.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.320
Asian. What can you do
about that?

09:15.322 --> 09:17.155
She's not even Asian.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.891
She's adopted.
She has red fucking hair.

09:19.893 --> 09:23.161
I'm sorry. That was mean.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.663
Good for her.
No.

09:24.665 --> 09:27.032
Screw Chang.
You are the best.

09:27.034 --> 09:29.601
Yeah. No one reads
the news like you, Meghan.

09:29.603 --> 09:32.904
We're going to sit down
and come up with a plan
to fix your life.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.774
Okay, guys, no more
pity party. It's fine.

09:35.776 --> 09:41.713
So go. I'll be fine.
I'm just gonna stay here
and catch up on <i> Idol.</i>

09:41.715 --> 09:43.048
No! We're not gonna
leave you here.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.683
You don't even have your dog.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.952
Technically, it was Kyle's dog.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.054
Who cares? Forget it.
Get a cat.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.957
Ew. That's gross.
Cats hate me. You know that.

09:51.959 --> 09:54.659
People say cats are clean,
but they're really filthy.

09:54.661 --> 09:56.962
I am sorry, okay?
Whatever.

09:56.964 --> 10:00.699
You're gonna meet
some young, stupid, hot guy,

10:00.701 --> 10:03.902
and you're gonna take all
your anger and your aggression
out on his penis.

10:03.904 --> 10:06.838
I don't know.
I don't do that with penises.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.809
I'm more of
a relationship type of girl.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.344
We're taking you out.
Come on. Let's go.

10:12.346 --> 10:15.213
Fine, but I'm wearing
these sweatpants.

10:15.215 --> 10:19.084
No. You're gonna wear
something slutty,
like Denise.

10:19.086 --> 10:21.753
I don't own anything
slutty like Denise.

10:21.755 --> 10:22.887
Denise, give Meghan your dress.

10:22.889 --> 10:24.255

24:11.017 --> 24:12.683
No, no, no.

24:12.685 --> 24:14.685
This is Tattoo,

24:14.687 --> 24:17.788
and I said "tow to"
as in "tow your car."

24:17.790 --> 24:20.157
This is a funny
language miscommunication.

24:20.159 --> 24:22.726
I can't get out here
because I don't nave my money.

24:22.728 --> 24:24.762
It's in my purse,
which is in my car.

24:24.764 --> 24:28.566
Which is at the <i> tow</i>
to place. Tow to.

24:28.568 --> 24:30.901
You no pay, I drive you jail.

24:30.903 --> 24:33.737
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We don't... There's no jail.

24:33.739 --> 24:36.841
Then you pay $23.
I am not a stripper.

24:36.843 --> 24:38.976
I'm actually a journalist...

24:38.978 --> 24:41.645
with local Emmy nominations
and a lot of connections,

24:41.647 --> 24:44.048
so you will get paid.

24:44.050 --> 24:46.116
You will get your money.

24:46.118 --> 24:50.821
But right now, I really,
really need you to just
help me out, okay?

24:50.823 --> 24:52.223
Do you understand?

24:53.058 --> 24:54.658
Okay.
Okay.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.694
You give me
a dance on lap. Huh?

24:56.696 --> 25:00.898
Four song.
Dance on lap, $23.
Finish.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.900
No. There's no deal.
No?

25:02.902 --> 25:04.869
Yes.
I can't give you
a lap dance, sir.

25:04.871 --> 25:06.704
- Four song.
- No.

25:06.706 --> 25:08.806
- You give me three song.
- No deal.

25:08.808 --> 25:09.907
No, no, no.
Okay!

25:09.909 --> 25:11.775
You dance on lap
or I take to jail.

25:11.777 --> 25:13.277
Wait, wait, wait.
You can put the gun down.

25:13.279 --> 25:14.979
Wait.
Um... Um...

25:14.981 --> 25:18.249
- Two dances.
- No, no, no.
Bullshit for me.

25:18.251 --> 25:20.818
Good deal. Yeah?

25:20.820 --> 25:24.088
- Two songs.
- Okay. Two song.

25:24.090 --> 25:26.657
Alanis Morissette
in-in V.I.P. room.

25:26.659 --> 25:28.726
The... Sure. The V.I.P. room.

25:28.728 --> 25:30.261
Just unlock the door.
Yeah. Okay.

25:30.263 --> 25:32.162
Leave the gun.
You can't take a gun in there.

25:32.164 --> 25:34.131
Oh, no gun. No gun.

25:34.133 --> 25:35.933
I get lap ready.

25:40.038 --> 25:41.772
Come on. We...

25:41.774 --> 25:44.875
Hey!

25:44.877 --> 25:46.877
Where are you going?
Come on back!
We had deal.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.646
Hey, lady!

25:50.583 --> 25:52.082
Son of a bitch.

25:52.084 --> 25:53.884
This is nuts.
What the fuck, lady?

26:35.795 --> 26:39.029
Oh, my God!

26:39.031 --> 26:41.865
<i>♪ Everybody have fun tonight ♪</i>

26:44.169 --> 26:47.037
- Hey, wait!
Wait, wait, wait!
- What do you want from me?

26:47.039 --> 26:49.273
Wait. You can help me.
Hang on. You can...

26:49.275 --> 26:51.008
Hey, hey, hey!
Go away!

26:51.010 --> 26:53.844
I need... I just...
You could help... Hey!

26:58.049 --> 27:01.118
Oh. Hey, hey. Hey, hi.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.920
Hey.

27:04.656 --> 27:06.824
Hi.

27:09.694 --> 27:12.096
Hi.
How you doing?

27:12.098 --> 27:14.131
I'm not so good, actually.
I could really use
some help.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.867
Yeah, I could use
some help too.
Oh, really? With what?

27:18.303 --> 27:20.738
Oh, no.
Yeah.

27:20.740 --> 27:21.805
Oh, yeah.
No.

27:21.807 --> 27:23.974
I'm not a...

27:23.976 --> 27:25.743
I'm not a hooker.
Yeah, okay.

27:25.745 --> 27:28.846
Have a good night.
No, no, no, no.
Wait. You can't...

27:28.848 --> 27:31.081
Oh! That's disgusting.

27:31.083 --> 27:34.218
Oh, God.

27:34.220 --> 27:36.687
This stupid dress.
I am gonna murder Denise.

27:36.689 --> 27:38.389
Oh, my God, I'm...

27:39.691 --> 27:40.991
freezing.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.660
Hey!

27:42.662 --> 27:43.694
Who the fuck are you?

27:43.696 --> 27:45.295
Uh, I'm not a prostitute.

27:45.297 --> 27:47.798
- Excuse me?
- Check out Barbie over here.

27:47.800 --> 27:50.134
Where did you guys
come from?

27:50.136 --> 27:51.402
Go on.

27:53.906 --> 27:57.074
Hey, hey. Excuse me.
Is there any chance that you
are not looking for a hooker?

27:57.076 --> 27:59.343
Free agent?

27:59.345 --> 28:01.078
Get out of here.
Looks like it.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.213
It's ballsy.

28:03.215 --> 28:05.295
Gotta give it to her, man.
That takes a lot of balls.

28:07.318 --> 28:10.821
Oh, no, come on, Dave.
Man, it's the end
of our shift.

28:10.823 --> 28:13.223
Look, dude,
I just gotta get home,
get a little bit of rest.

28:13.225 --> 28:14.992
I was gonna drive
down to Long Beach.

28:14.994 --> 28:16.760
Got this whole
fishing-charter thing
set up.

28:16.762 --> 28:18.262
It's our job, Walter.
No, it isn't.

28:18.264 --> 28:20.964
Our job is to keep
the hookers over there,

28:20.966 --> 28:22.866
away from the
decent people down there.

28:22.868 --> 28:25.169
All right.
All right, look.

28:25.171 --> 28:28.472
We can issue her
an official warning,

28:28.474 --> 28:31.308
but if I see her out here
again, we gotta take her in.

28:31.310 --> 28:33.444
See? That's good police work.
That's what I'm talking about.

28:33.446 --> 28:35.312
- What's the matter,
you can't hear?
- I have nothing against...

28:35.314 --> 28:38.949
uh, modern...
female entrepreneurs.

28:38.951 --> 28:40.384
Oh, shit.

28:40.386 --> 28:43.253
Thank God. Oh, hallelujah!

28:43.255 --> 28:46.156
<i>Do not approach</i>
<i>the vehicle.</i>

28:46.158 --> 28:47.858
<i>Ma'am, what you're</i>
<i>doing is the opposite...</i>

28:47.860 --> 28:50.127
of not approaching the vehicle.

28:50.129 --> 28:52.396
I... Okay.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.498
I can't see now.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.900
Thank goodness you are here.

28:56.902 --> 28:58.402
I am so happy to see you.
You deaf?

28:58.404 --> 29:01.205
This has been the longest
night of my life.

29:01.207 --> 29:03.006
Quit your babbling.
This has been the...

29:03.008 --> 29:04.408
Quit your babbling and listen.

29:04.410 --> 29:07.244
Okay.
We have you on video
soliciting those cars.

29:07.246 --> 29:09.279
What...
We can haul you in
right now.

29:09.281 --> 29:11.782
No, no, no, no.
I was not soliciting sex.

29:11.784 --> 29:14.051
Ma'am, do not
raise your voice at me.

29:14.053 --> 29:15.374
Don't you raise
your voice at him!

29:16.867 --> 29:18.188
How much you had
to drink tonight?

29:18.190 --> 29:21.024
- Uh...
- You smell like a distillery.

29:22.360 --> 29:25.129
I just...
I haven't been home.
Neither have I.

29:25.131 --> 29:28.165
Which is why we're gonna give
you a break and let you off
with a warning.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.901
Ready? Here it is.
Stay off of my streets.

29:30.903 --> 29:34.805
- But-But...
- We see you out here again,
and you will go to jail.

29:34.807 --> 29:36.440
But I didn't do anything wrong.

29:36.442 --> 29:39.042
Really?
You haven't done
anything wrong?

29:39.044 --> 29:40.310
What, are you going out
to get some eggs?

29:40.312 --> 29:42.012
Just wrapping up
your paper route?

29:42.014 --> 29:44.248
It's time to grow up.

29:44.250 --> 29:47.084
- Now stay off my streets.
- Stay off his streets.

29:47.086 --> 29:49.787
- I can...
- Sit down and think about it.

29:49.789 --> 29:52.055
Think about it.
Sit down.
Don't be on your knees.

29:52.057 --> 29:55.192
Off his streets
and grow the fuck up, okay?

29:57.028 --> 29:58.929
You're not going to help me?

29:58.931 --> 30:01.865
Aren't you supposed
to help people?

30:01.867 --> 30:04.301
I... I'm not a...

30:04.303 --> 30:06.837
Bitch, get outta here.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.842
That sounded tough. Veteran.

30:11.844 --> 30:13.577
Oh, thank you.

30:13.579 --> 30:16.346
Yeah, we did the right thing.

30:16.348 --> 30:18.949
You better start running!
Okay. I'm going.

30:18.951 --> 30:20.384
I'm running. I'm running.
I'm running.

30:31.463 --> 30:33.030
Molly?

30:33.032 --> 30:35.833
Me... Mel...

30:35.835 --> 30:37.334

30:37.336 --> 30:39.469

a little fuzzy last night.

Hey, babe.
What...

31:28.954 --> 31:30.587
What are you doing here?

31:30.589 --> 31:33.123
I like to get up early.

31:33.125 --> 31:36.260
Of course you do.
You're like 70.

31:36.262 --> 31:39.296
Just to clarify,
what happened last night?

31:39.298 --> 31:41.531
Everything.
Everything?

31:41.533 --> 31:43.634
- And by everything,
you mean...
- Everything.

31:43.636 --> 31:46.536
- I just passed out...
- Everything but that.

31:46.538 --> 31:49.039
Listen, you got a banana
or something?

31:49.041 --> 31:51.441
I'm sorry.
This was a mistake.

31:51.443 --> 31:55.112
I thought I was taking home
a really young, very cute guy.

31:55.980 --> 31:57.481
You must mean my son.

31:57.483 --> 31:59.283
Yeah, we get confused
all the time.

31:59.285 --> 32:01.051
Don't worry about it.

32:01.053 --> 32:02.486
Crazy night.
You can party.

32:02.488 --> 32:04.388
Fuck.

32:06.926 --> 32:11.094
Yeah. What you
think I'm doing?
I'm on the corner.

32:11.096 --> 32:13.330
Yeah. Hold up.
Hold up. Hold up.

32:14.966 --> 32:16.266
What's up?
All right, cool.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.201
Follow that guy down there.

32:22.041 --> 32:23.473
Yeah, baby, what's up?

32:25.009 --> 32:26.576
Sometimes I wonder.

32:26.578 --> 32:29.246
They like the fuckin'
Keystone Kops out there.

32:31.549 --> 32:34.985
All right, later.

32:34.987 --> 32:37.354
Sneaking up on me
is a bad idea.
No, no, no.

32:37.356 --> 32:39.022
Hi. I'm not sneaking up.

32:39.024 --> 32:40.724
I wasn't. I just...
No samples.

32:40.726 --> 32:43.327
Keep your zombie ass moving.

32:43.329 --> 32:45.262
I-I just need a little help.

32:45.264 --> 32:46.363
Sir.

32:46.365 --> 32:48.365
Now, I know you can see
I'm working,

32:48.367 --> 32:51.034
and I'm sure you done
worked that ass
enough tonight.

32:51.036 --> 32:55.305
You need
to get on home.
That's all I want to do.

32:55.307 --> 32:57.374
And I don't want your drugs.

32:57.376 --> 33:01.011
Excuse me?
Oh. I mean... That was
a terrible assumption.

33:01.013 --> 33:03.380
I mean, I don't know
if there's...
I wouldn't...

33:03.382 --> 33:04.648
Yeah, you don't know.
You're right.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.616
You need to forget
what you think I'm doing.

33:06.618 --> 33:09.052
It's already forgotten.
I'm so sorry about that.

33:09.054 --> 33:10.554
Um, I just want
to borrow your phone.

33:10.556 --> 33:13.023
Can I please make a call
on your phone?

33:13.025 --> 33:15.192
I'm pretty sure today might
be the most important day
of my life,

33:15.194 --> 33:16.727
but I really need
to make a call.

33:16.729 --> 33:18.395
Please, I'm...

33:19.430 --> 33:21.598
I am not what you think I am.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.066
I swear.

33:23.068 --> 33:24.768
I'm a good girl.

33:28.539 --> 33:30.607
Oh, shit.
You ain't that good.

33:30.609 --> 33:34.644
The police said
if they find me again
they're gonna arrest me.

33:34.646 --> 33:38.382
For what?
Being a good girl?

33:38.384 --> 33:41.518
It was a misunderstanding...
at worst.

33:41.520 --> 33:44.187
Five-0! Five-O!
Full team's coming.

33:44.189 --> 33:46.223
Oh. You better get lost.

33:46.225 --> 33:48.191
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

33:48.193 --> 33:49.760
What the fuck are you doing?

33:49.762 --> 33:51.728
I'm getting lost.
Get lost somewhere else.

33:51.730 --> 33:53.430
Where?
I don't know.

33:53.432 --> 33:55.665
That's why they
call that shit lost.

33:56.334 --> 33:58.268
Bitch, why are you so fast?

33:58.270 --> 33:59.703
I ran track in high school.

34:02.273 --> 34:04.441
Hang on. Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

34:04.443 --> 34:06.343
Hang on. Hey!

34:06.345 --> 34:09.045
Fuckin' yellow-ass Terminator.

34:12.498 --> 34:14.618
I've gotta go home.
What are you
still doing behind me?

34:14.620 --> 34:17.120
- Get out of here, man!
- I need to get in here.

34:17.121 --> 34:18.655
Get off me.
Get away from me, bitch.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.759
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?
Just give me the phone.

34:22.761 --> 34:25.128
You better go back out.
Go back out.
I can't go out there.

34:25.130 --> 34:26.596
Go.
I can't go out there.

34:27.764 --> 34:29.466
I can't. I can't
be caught out there.

34:33.103 --> 34:34.771
Oh.
What the fuck
are you doing in here?

34:34.773 --> 34:38.775
I was one of the ones
runnin' from the Five-O.

34:38.777 --> 34:41.812
- Who the fuck are you?
- Yo, chill. Chill, chill.

34:41.813 --> 34:45.114
- She with me.
- Yeah. I'm with him.
Yeah.

34:45.117 --> 34:46.516
Just some dumb ho.

34:47.152 --> 34:50.687
You fuckin' stupid?
Look at this bitch.

34:50.688 --> 34:55.225
She a undercover cop
wearing what looks like
a Marc Jacobs dress.

34:55.226 --> 34:57.627
You think some raggedy-ass
trick get her hands on that?

34:57.629 --> 34:59.629
Hold the fuck up.

35:02.633 --> 35:05.302
How the fuck
you know what a fuckin'
Marc "Jenkins" dress is?

35:05.304 --> 35:09.439
Watch one episode
of <i> What Not to Wear</i>
and get back to me.

35:09.441 --> 35:12.209
- Bitch is a cop.
- Man, she a trick.

35:12.211 --> 35:13.877
- Cop.
- She's a trick.

35:13.879 --> 35:16.480
No! That's the bitch
from the news.

35:16.482 --> 35:18.682
What?
Why you let Pookie
up in here?

35:18.684 --> 35:21.418
Why you let
some cop up in here?
Look, she ain't no cop.

35:21.420 --> 35:23.120
That's the bitch from the news.

35:23.122 --> 35:25.122
Channel Six <i> Live at 5:00.</i>

35:25.124 --> 35:27.124
I'm about to put my foot up
in your motherfucking mouth.

35:27.126 --> 35:29.893
I-I'm not a cop.
I'm not.

35:29.895 --> 35:31.728
I am...
I'm bitch from the news.

35:31.730 --> 35:35.432
"For KZLA <i> Live at 5:00</i>
<i>Eyewitness News,</i>

35:35.434 --> 35:36.867
I'm Meghan Miles.

35:36.869 --> 35:38.435
Be well."

35:38.437 --> 35:40.403
Pookie, shut the hell up.

35:40.405 --> 35:43.173
Why the hell would
KZLA's Meghan Miles...

35:43.175 --> 35:46.176
be sucking dick
for crack in our hood?

35:46.178 --> 35:48.545
No, I'm not
sucking dick for crack.

35:48.547 --> 35:50.447
What you sucking dick for then?

35:50.449 --> 35:52.215
Nothing.

35:52.217 --> 35:54.351
- Shit's free?
- Uh...

35:54.353 --> 35:56.820
So, you ain't sucked
one dick tonight?

35:59.824 --> 36:01.725
Yeah, that's what I thought.

36:01.727 --> 36:03.827
Okay, but it's...
That's not, uh...

36:03.829 --> 36:05.495
Look, I'm just lost.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.297
And I just need
to make a phone call.

36:07.299 --> 36:10.300
- I just wanted
to borrow your phone.
- Look, right here. Look.

36:10.302 --> 36:13.336
- Oh, my God.
- Bitch from the news.

36:13.338 --> 36:14.437
Yeah.
Look at this.

36:14.439 --> 36:17.541
"Be well." I love it.

36:17.543 --> 36:20.177
Oh, shit.
It do kind of look like you.

36:20.179 --> 36:22.946
Yeah. I'm Meghan.
Meghan Miles.

36:22.948 --> 36:24.681
Look, bitch from the news,

36:24.683 --> 36:27.284
you real good and stuff,

36:27.286 --> 36:30.954
but I just think
you need to work on inviting
the audience in a little more.

36:30.956 --> 36:33.223
Earnin' they trust.

36:33.225 --> 36:35.592
You have a natural,
approachable beauty.
I like it.

36:35.594 --> 36:38.628
But your delivery
is just a little robotic.

36:38.630 --> 36:42.666
I just feel like
you can show us
a little more warmth.

36:42.668 --> 36:45.769
- I know it's in there.
- Pookie, what
you smoking on?

36:45.771 --> 36:48.371
Weed laced with embalming fluid.

36:48.373 --> 36:49.940
It's pretty good.

36:49.942 --> 36:51.908
No, no, no. I kind of see
what he's sayin'.

36:51.910 --> 36:54.711
Uh-huh.
See, it's like you closed
to the world.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.680
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

36:56.682 --> 36:58.615
I mean, look how you holding
your shoulders right now.
Mm-hmm.

36:58.617 --> 37:00.717
All closed off...

37:02.353 --> 37:05.555
like you don't trust us.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.992
Okay, these are, uh,
excellent points.

37:08.994 --> 37:12.495
Viewer feedback
is very important
to me, Mr., uh...

37:12.497 --> 37:14.297
- Hulk.
- Hulk.

37:14.299 --> 37:15.498
- And?
- Scrilla.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.567
Scrilla and Pookie.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.836
- With two O's.
- Okay.

37:19.838 --> 37:23.540
I'm gonna take
everything you said...

37:23.542 --> 37:25.342
I'm going to take it all
under consideration.

37:25.344 --> 37:27.410
I need to get back
to do the news.

37:27.412 --> 37:29.346
Tonight, live at 5:00.

37:29.348 --> 37:32.849
I'm up for a promotion,
so it's really important
that I be there.

37:32.851 --> 37:34.551
But I am lost,

37:34.553 --> 37:37.454
and I don't have a phone
or money,

37:37.456 --> 37:39.289
and my car's in the impound lot.

37:39.291 --> 37:43.260
And I am currently
standing in the middle
of a ghetto crack house.

37:43.262 --> 37:45.295
Sorry. No offense.

37:45.297 --> 37:48.531
- None taken.
- That's a pretty fair
description.

37:48.533 --> 37:50.700
Look, I'll tell you what.

37:50.702 --> 37:52.269
I'm going to help you out.

37:52.271 --> 37:54.938
- Yeah. Exactly.
- Give her that one.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.340
Use that one.
Okay.

37:58.476 --> 38:00.010
Thank you.
You got it.

38:00.012 --> 38:01.611
- Thank you.
- Right over there.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.580
Okay.

38:03.582 --> 38:06.583
- Give me that.
- What happened to that dress?

38:06.585 --> 38:09.953
Since when you watch the news?
I wake up at 5:00.
That's what I...

38:09.955 --> 38:11.888
You got a TV?

38:11.890 --> 38:14.958
You see the TV in the back.
You need to sell that shit.
You owe me money.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.860
I already paid you.

38:16.862 --> 38:19.896
- Remember my E.B.T. card?
- Shut the hell up.

38:33.444 --> 38:34.978
What's wrong, sweetheart?

38:35.880 --> 38:38.581
I don't know anybody's number.

38:38.583 --> 38:41.584
They were all in my phone.

38:41.586 --> 38:43.586
I use the voice dialing
in my car,

38:43.588 --> 38:46.022
and everyone's on speed dial.

38:46.024 --> 38:48.558
That's some modern-day,
fucked-up shit, huh?

38:49.493 --> 38:51.995
Yeah.

38:51.997 --> 38:54.331
I only know,
like, three numbers.

38:54.333 --> 38:57.801
My parents in Texas,
and I am <i> not </i> calling them.

38:57.803 --> 39:00.503
I know my own number
so I could give it out
to people.

39:00.505 --> 39:01.971
I'll just...
I should text myself, right?

39:01.973 --> 39:04.441
Someone might get it.
That's a good idea.

39:04.443 --> 39:07.544
Okay. "It's Meghan.
Help. I'm"...

39:07.546 --> 39:09.779
- Where am I?
- The hood.

39:09.781 --> 39:11.881
We more like hood-adjacent.

39:12.950 --> 39:14.984
Hood. Yeah.

39:14.986 --> 39:16.720
So what's the other number?

39:24.662 --> 39:26.129
Who is this?

39:27.665 --> 39:29.366
<i>You woke me up.</i>

39:29.368 --> 39:31.901
Goddamn it,
I said who is this?
Just talk.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.670
It's me. It's Meghan.

39:35.740 --> 39:37.574
You were never gonna call me.

39:37.576 --> 39:41.945
I had to call you, okay, Kyle?
I had to.
<i>Listen.</i>

39:41.947 --> 39:44.681
Breaking up
was the hardest thing
I ever did.

39:44.683 --> 39:46.416
<i>Just hold on.</i>

39:46.418 --> 39:48.084
Hang on.

39:48.086 --> 39:50.587
Why are you talking so low?

39:50.589 --> 39:52.889
Are you...

39:52.891 --> 39:56.793
Are you with someone?
Is someone there
with you <i> already?</i>

39:56.795 --> 39:59.729
- Are you drunk?
- Technically, probably yes.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.698
Is this a booty call?

40:01.700 --> 40:03.600
No! I don't want
to have sex with you.

40:03.602 --> 40:05.735
Damn! Who you
talking to?

40:05.737 --> 40:07.470
It's my ex-fiancé.

40:07.472 --> 40:09.506
Oh, okay.
All right.

40:09.508 --> 40:11.107
- Who's that?
- That is Pookie.

40:11.109 --> 40:12.776
He's an acquaintance of mine.

40:12.778 --> 40:15.178
Okay, so then you
are not alone either.

40:15.180 --> 40:17.080
What are you doing?
Why are you calling me?

40:17.082 --> 40:19.115
I called you
because I'm in trouble,
Kyle, okay?

40:19.117 --> 40:21.117
I need you to come and get me,

40:21.119 --> 40:23.853
and I only knew
three numbers, okay?

40:23.855 --> 40:26.055
You and my parents
and 1-800-FLOWERS,

40:26.057 --> 40:27.991
and I wish to God
it wasn't the case,

40:27.993 --> 40:29.859
but some things just stick,
you know?

40:29.861 --> 40:31.094
I can't get rid of you.

40:31.096 --> 40:33.563
Anybody know any numbers?
I don't know.

40:33.565 --> 40:34.798
I know the bail bond's number.

40:34.800 --> 40:37.767
♪ 800-588-2300 ♪

40:37.769 --> 40:39.636
What you gonna
need that for?
♪ Empire ♪

40:39.638 --> 40:42.138
I may need some carpet
or something.

40:42.140 --> 40:46.009
- Are you in jail?
- Not yet, but it's
a distinct possibility.

40:46.011 --> 40:49.078
Sober up.
Call a taxi, all right?
I gotta go.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.915
Kyle, who are you talking to?

40:51.917 --> 40:54.484
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God,
there <i> is </i> someone there!

40:54.486 --> 40:55.852
<i>I knew it!</i>
<i>You bastard!</i>

40:55.854 --> 40:58.488
I'm sorry.
<i>Please don't call me again.</i>

40:58.490 --> 41:00.623
Baby, can you please
come help me?
<i>It is over, okay?</i>

41:00.625 --> 41:02.525
- Listen...
- Gotta...

41:02.527 --> 41:04.561
Now you listen, motherfucker.

41:04.563 --> 41:06.563
I don't know
what the fuck you did
to Meghan Miles...

41:06.565 --> 41:08.031
from the motherfuckin' news,

41:08.033 --> 41:12.068
but you better drag
your cracker-ass
out of bed...

41:12.070 --> 41:18.041
And get down to this crack
house and get Meghan Miles
the fuck out of here.

41:18.043 --> 41:20.009
She gotta go
do the motherfuckin' news,

41:20.011 --> 41:22.011
or else she won't get
her fuckin' promotion.

41:22.013 --> 41:24.214
<i>Give me that. Yo.</i>

41:24.216 --> 41:27.217
You show one more
motherfuckin' ounce
of disrespect to this woman,

41:27.219 --> 41:30.854
and I swear I will
track your bitch ass down
and set your ass on fire.

41:30.856 --> 41:33.156
You hear me?
Now I got your number
in my phone,

41:33.158 --> 41:34.891
but say something else.

41:34.893 --> 41:36.526
<i>Okay. Yes, sir.</i>
That's good.
That was so sweet.

41:36.528 --> 41:38.528
Really. Thank you.
I got you.

41:38.530 --> 41:40.230
Uh, who's <i> that?</i>

41:40.232 --> 41:42.799
That's Scrilla and Hulk.
They are also
acquaintances of mine.

41:42.801 --> 41:45.635
Are you in a crack house?
<i>Yes, Kyle.</i>

41:45.637 --> 41:47.670
That is what I am
trying to tell you.

41:47.672 --> 41:49.739
I am in a crack house.

41:49.741 --> 41:52.075
Oh, shit!

41:52.077 --> 41:54.010
Die slow, motherfucker!

41:58.849 --> 42:00.550
Is this a joke, Meghan?

42:03.554 --> 42:05.522
What the fuck is happening?

42:05.524 --> 42:08.057
Meghan Miles from the news,
you gotta go now.

42:08.059 --> 42:11.060
Go through that door,
make a right.
Go down the steps.

42:11.062 --> 42:13.196
You'll see a vent.
Jump in it.
It'll take you out the back.

42:13.198 --> 42:14.964
Go! Go!

42:16.934 --> 42:20.103
You got this, right?
Wait up, bitch from the news.

42:20.105 --> 42:21.871
I'm gonna put
some caps in your ass!

42:21.873 --> 42:23.806
Why is this happening to me?

42:27.177 --> 42:28.811
Right down here.

42:31.782 --> 42:33.883
Who the fuck
are you, motherfuckers?

42:34.985 --> 42:36.920
Ooh! Oh!

42:38.255 --> 42:39.722
Aaah!

42:39.724 --> 42:41.658
Oh. My bad.
Pookie?

42:41.660 --> 42:43.026
Yeah, it's me.

42:43.028 --> 42:45.595
Okay.
Come on, to the right.
Come on.

42:45.597 --> 42:46.663
Okay.
Now go to the right.

42:46.665 --> 42:51.167
This way, Meghan Miles.
Who was that?
Why is that happening?

42:51.169 --> 42:52.969
I don't know.
That was insane.

42:52.971 --> 42:54.938
I don't want to get shot.

42:54.940 --> 42:57.307
I was just out
having a good time.
Come on.

42:57.309 --> 43:01.177
<i>12th Street crack house.</i>
<i>Shots fired.</i>

43:01.179 --> 43:04.147
<i>Three black males,</i>
<i>one Caucasian female</i>
<i>in a yellow dress.</i>

43:04.149 --> 43:06.082
You believe this?

43:06.084 --> 43:09.118
Maybe it's some
other white chick
in a yellow dress.

43:09.120 --> 43:12.055
Hey, hey, hey. Whoa.
You saw this lady?

43:12.057 --> 43:14.290
- You gotta talk
to the lieutenant.
- No, we don't.

43:14.292 --> 43:16.726
Yeah, you do.

43:16.728 --> 43:19.228
Actually, we do.
I know we do.

43:19.230 --> 43:21.197
You're just supposed
to say we don't.

43:22.299 --> 43:24.100
Aw, shit.

43:24.102 --> 43:25.935
Shit, shit.

43:25.937 --> 43:27.070
Go!

43:29.873 --> 43:31.007
Pookie?
Huh?

43:31.009 --> 43:34.744
Do you know where
the impound lot is?

43:34.746 --> 43:36.245
Where they tow cars to?
Uh...

43:36.247 --> 43:38.181
The tow to.
You know where that is?
Is it nearby?

43:38.183 --> 43:40.650
Yes, yes. Okay.
The impound lot.
Yeah.

43:40.652 --> 43:43.386
What you want to do,
you wanna take this street
all the way down.

43:43.388 --> 43:45.021
Hit Western.

43:45.023 --> 43:47.023
Follow that like
it's your yellow brick road.

43:47.025 --> 43:49.092
You gonna go under the 10.

43:49.094 --> 43:51.027
If you hit Dollar Taco,
you gone too far.

43:51.029 --> 43:53.396
Okay, so the Western
and the 10.
You're sure?

43:53.398 --> 43:55.398
Yeah. Yeah, I'm about sure.

43:55.400 --> 43:57.867
But look, don't use
the bathroom at Dollar Taco.
It's really bad.

43:57.869 --> 43:59.168
Okay.
Don't do it.

43:59.170 --> 44:01.004
Thank you.
Okay, you be good.

44:01.006 --> 44:02.705
Wait, wait, wait!
What?

44:07.011 --> 44:08.678
Oh, no, no.
No, I...

44:08.680 --> 44:10.246
No. Take this.

44:13.751 --> 44:16.085
Pookie, I can't take your crack.

44:16.087 --> 44:18.821
It's worth about $10
on the street.

44:18.823 --> 44:20.823
But don't smoke it.

44:20.825 --> 44:22.425
It normally doesn't end well,

44:22.427 --> 44:23.993
at least for me.

44:23.995 --> 44:27.397
Pookie, I cannot
take your crack.
No. No, no.

44:27.399 --> 44:29.065
I insist. Please.

44:29.067 --> 44:31.934
When a crackhead
gives you his crack,

44:31.936 --> 44:34.704
you have his heart right there.

44:34.706 --> 44:38.875
Just remember,
shout out your boy Pookie
next time you're on air, okay?

44:39.877 --> 44:42.712
Um, okay.

44:42.714 --> 44:46.449
And don't forget to
shout out Scrilla and Hulk...
Yup.

44:46.451 --> 44:48.718
And Skip, Skip-a-doo,

44:48.720 --> 44:50.987
Treezy, B-Bow...

44:50.989 --> 44:52.889
not to be confused
with G-Bow...

44:52.891 --> 44:55.758
- Little Markeese
and also my Uncle Joseph.
- Sure.

44:55.760 --> 44:57.994
He's locked down in Chino.

44:58.195 --> 44:59.896
Okay.

44:59.898 --> 45:02.165
- Oh, and Meghan Miles?
- Yeah?

45:02.167 --> 45:03.433
Be well.

45:03.435 --> 45:05.368
Be well too.

45:05.370 --> 45:08.137
I'll be well if I get
my ass out of here.

45:08.139 --> 45:10.273
For two years, there's been
a tenuous peace...

45:10.275 --> 45:15.411
Then, all of a sudden,
some mystery white woman in
a yellow dress shows up...

45:15.413 --> 45:16.846
and everything goes to shit.

45:16.848 --> 45:18.815
I know. It's crazy.

45:18.817 --> 45:20.216
Add to that,
she jacks a cabdriver.

45:20.218 --> 45:21.984
Now she's running
with Scrilla's gang.

45:21.986 --> 45:23.920
No, no, no, no.
She's just a hooker.

45:23.922 --> 45:25.288
We saw her at the Point.
Yeah.

45:25.290 --> 45:27.256
- And you didn't bring her in?
- I wanted to.

45:29.760 --> 45:31.260
Tell you what, Lieutenant,

45:31.262 --> 45:32.995
How about we just brief
the next shift coming in...

45:32.997 --> 45:35.865
Next shift?
Ain't no next shift for you.

45:35.867 --> 45:37.867
You two can I.D. her.
You're staying on
till we bring her in.

45:37.869 --> 45:40.169
Caucasian, yellow dress, hooker.

45:40.171 --> 45:42.238
Back to the streets, fellas.

45:42.240 --> 45:44.974
Sorry.
What's wrong with you?
"I wanted to."

45:44.976 --> 45:48.111
Protect and serve.
Go fuck yourself, Vic.

46:05.362 --> 46:07.830
"It's Meghan. Help.
Lost in the Hood."

46:15.305 --> 46:19.509
<i>Who this?</i>
Oh, hey. This is...
I'm looking for Meghan.

46:19.511 --> 46:22.211
<i>Bitch from the news?</i>
<i>She gone.</i>

46:22.213 --> 46:24.380
<i>Don't call this number again,</i>
<i>motherfucker.</i>

46:50.340 --> 46:53.876
Oh! Ooh.
Oh. Sorry.
I didn't see you there.

46:53.878 --> 46:55.545
Ugh. Okay.
Hey! You're Meghan Miles,

46:55.547 --> 46:57.146
that Channel Six news lady.

46:57.148 --> 46:58.981
<i>I"En vivo!</i>

46:58.983 --> 47:00.516
<i>En vivo.</i>
What are you doing
down here?

47:00.518 --> 47:02.518
It's a long story.
You don't have five dollars,
do you?

47:02.520 --> 47:06.122
- In the store, I do.
Can you wait right here?
- Sure.

47:06.124 --> 47:08.891
For five dollars,
let me take your photo
and I'll put it on the wall.

47:08.893 --> 47:10.893
Oh. No, no. I can't...

47:10.895 --> 47:12.862
And then I put it
on Facebook
and everyone likes it.

47:12.864 --> 47:15.464
No, no. Oh, no, no.
You can't put a photo
on Facebook.

47:15.466 --> 47:18.201
No, no photos.
I'll send you a head shot.
I'll send you something.

47:21.305 --> 47:23.539
Hey, look!
Meghan Miles
on the walk of shame.

47:46.630 --> 47:48.331
Uh, Meghan's phone.

47:48.333 --> 47:50.266
Who's this?
Where's Meghan?

47:50.268 --> 47:55.438
Well, where is she now?
Why do you have her phone?
Did you hurt her?

47:55.440 --> 47:59.308
No. No, I...
We went home together
last night,

47:59.310 --> 48:02.044
and I'm thinking
she might be in some
trouble right now.

48:02.046 --> 48:04.647
She left her phone here,
and I have no idea
where she is.

48:04.649 --> 48:08.017
You better be telling
the truth, psycho,
because I will out-psycho you.

48:08.019 --> 48:10.219
And if you hurt Meghan,
I will reign fucking fury down
on you.

48:10.221 --> 48:13.022
<i>Relax.</i>

48:13.024 --> 48:15.625
<i>Where do you live?</i>
244 Traction.

48:15.627 --> 48:19.128
- Where the fuck is that?
- It's downtown
near the Sixth Street bridge.

48:19.130 --> 48:21.197
People live there?
<i>Yeah. I do.</i>

48:21.199 --> 48:23.599
Buzz 810 when you get here.

48:23.601 --> 48:26.202
All right, well, you stay
there or I'm calling the cops.

48:28.506 --> 48:30.907
<i>Denise, get up.</i>
I'm up.

48:30.909 --> 48:33.309
- I can hear
your sound machine.
- I need to just lie here.

48:33.311 --> 48:35.111
It's bad.
It's really bad.

48:35.113 --> 48:37.914
Denise, just get up.
Meghan might be in trouble.
She needs us.

48:37.916 --> 48:39.315
<i>You don't understand.</i>
<i>I...</i>

48:39.317 --> 48:42.018
Hey, babe, is everything cool?

48:42.020 --> 48:43.920
Please don't touch me.

48:43.922 --> 48:45.488
Who is that?

48:45.490 --> 48:47.990
<i>I made a terrible mistake</i>
<i>last night.</i>

48:47.992 --> 48:51.260
I think I may have
taken Iggy Pop home.

49:07.477 --> 49:10.479
All right, all right.
What's up? What's up?

49:11.248 --> 49:13.582
There you go.
Mm-hmm.

49:17.988 --> 49:20.022
What the fuck is this?

49:20.024 --> 49:21.991
Hi.
All right.

49:21.993 --> 49:24.260
Hey, I don't wanna
waste anyone's time.

49:24.262 --> 49:28.164
I'm gonna assume that
you're a crack dealer.

49:28.166 --> 49:30.967
And, um, I was wondering
if you wanted
a little more.

49:30.969 --> 49:32.735
A little more what?

49:32.737 --> 49:34.437
A little more crack.

49:34.439 --> 49:38.074
You know, like, maybe
I could cash it in
for some money.

49:38.076 --> 49:40.409
You wanna sell me crack?

49:40.411 --> 49:43.679
Well, I technically
don't wanna sell it because
I think that that's wrong.

49:43.681 --> 49:46.282
But I was hoping
that maybe make a return
or something.

49:46.284 --> 49:48.684
Oh. Okay. A return.
Yeah.

49:48.686 --> 49:50.353
You got the receipt?

49:50.355 --> 49:52.021
The...

49:52.023 --> 49:54.590
Uh...
Or maybe the box
it came in?

49:54.592 --> 49:57.126
Oh, come on, man,
I just have the crack.

49:57.128 --> 49:59.095
Oh, you just got the crack?
Yeah, that's all I have.

49:59.097 --> 50:01.497
And I just thought,
you know, you could
add it to your stash,

50:01.499 --> 50:03.532
Uh-huh.
Give me, like, 10 bucks,

50:03.534 --> 50:05.854
and then you can
sell it for more,
and that's good business.

50:07.571 --> 50:10.406
You don't walk
into McDonald's
with your own hamburgers...

50:10.408 --> 50:12.508
and try to sell it to 'em.

50:12.510 --> 50:15.011
You know why?
Because they already got
their own hamburgers.

50:15.013 --> 50:18.314
They're not gonna look
at your hamburgers
and be like, "Oh, shit.

50:18.316 --> 50:20.683
She's got hamburgers.
That looks like a good deal.

50:20.685 --> 50:23.352
Maybe I could buy 'em,
turn around and sell 'em
for twice as much."

50:23.354 --> 50:26.322
Crack is
all the same, right?
It's just this little thing.

50:26.324 --> 50:28.357
Put that shit away.
What the fuck you doing,
trying to set me up?

50:28.359 --> 50:32.395
I'm saying that it
would be very easy to
pass off as your own crack.

50:32.397 --> 50:33.662
It's probably all
from the same place,
isn't it?

50:33.664 --> 50:38.234
I technically got it
from Pookie who, I'm sure,
got it from Scrilla.

50:38.236 --> 50:40.169
Scrilla?
Yeah, yeah.
It's his crack.

50:40.171 --> 50:43.172
You wanna unload
Scrilla's shit on my corner,
pass it off as my own?

50:43.174 --> 50:45.775
You got a death wish, lady?
Yo, Ladeke!
What?

50:45.777 --> 50:48.210
Who's Ladeke?
Deal with this shit.
School this bitch right now.

50:48.212 --> 50:49.311
You're in the wrong territory.
This is the Figueroa Crew,
man.

50:49.313 --> 50:51.047
I'm going.

50:51.049 --> 50:53.182
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I'm not done with you.

50:53.184 --> 50:58.554
- I'm getting on the bus.
- Come back here, man.
You wanna disrespect me?

50:58.556 --> 51:00.156
Yo, Ladeke,
what am I, a sparrow?

51:00.158 --> 51:02.658
When I whistle,
you got to respond!

51:04.528 --> 51:06.462
You can't be behind the line.

51:06.464 --> 51:08.664
This one?
There's two sides.

51:08.666 --> 51:10.733
Is this the side?
You on the wrong side.

51:10.735 --> 51:12.468
Okay, okay, great.

51:12.470 --> 51:14.437
$1.50.

51:16.106 --> 51:18.207
You, blondie.

51:18.209 --> 51:20.776
Uh, yes. Yes.

51:20.778 --> 51:22.545
$1.50.

51:22.547 --> 51:25.648
Such a good
round... number.

51:25.650 --> 51:27.616
- Where's your money?
- Oh, it's, uh...

51:27.618 --> 51:29.518
You know what?
You can just keep going.

51:29.520 --> 51:31.787
It's, um...
It's here somewhere.

51:31.789 --> 51:33.456
It's, um...

51:34.124 --> 51:36.459
Shame.

51:36.461 --> 51:38.427
Are... Are you
talking to me?

51:38.429 --> 51:40.596
Have you no shame?

51:40.598 --> 51:42.765
I don't know
who you think you are,
Judgey Judgey Judgeyson,

51:42.767 --> 51:45.835
but I am... You know, don't...
I'm just trying to get
to work.

51:45.837 --> 51:48.637
Why don't you get
your pimp to drive you?

51:48.639 --> 51:51.207
These people are good people.

51:51.209 --> 51:54.710
Oh, I'm sorry.
I missed the sign
"good people only."

51:54.712 --> 51:57.413
How do you know
what is in my soul?
Hey!

51:57.415 --> 51:59.782
Oh, I can tell.
I can tell.
$1.50.

51:59.784 --> 52:03.419
Okay. Does the $1.50
need to be paid
at every stop...

52:03.421 --> 52:05.454
or does it cover
the entire journey?

52:07.157 --> 52:08.691
Are you for serious?

52:08.693 --> 52:10.593
I am for serious.

52:10.595 --> 52:13.662
Do you take credit cards?
Yeah. You can swipe it
right there.

52:13.664 --> 52:18.400
Really? That is amazing,
innovative technology...

52:18.402 --> 52:20.402
that you can just...

52:20.404 --> 52:22.538
Do you take
debit cards?

52:22.540 --> 52:24.673
Do you have a debit card?

52:25.208 --> 52:27.143
I do not.

52:27.145 --> 52:28.911
Listen. I'm gonna give you
some advice.

52:28.913 --> 52:30.746
Sure.

52:30.748 --> 52:32.481
You might wanna think
about another line of work,

52:32.483 --> 52:34.150
'cause you ain't
no good at this.

52:34.152 --> 52:35.751
If you ain't even got $1.50,

52:35.753 --> 52:39.722
you probably should
think about retiring
as a whore.

52:39.724 --> 52:44.660
And if you do scrape up $1.50,
use it to buy yourself
a sandwich.

52:44.662 --> 52:47.229
That's the reason
you can't turn no tricks...

52:47.231 --> 52:48.831
'cause you ain't got
no meat on your bones.

52:48.833 --> 52:51.200
Now, that advice was free,

52:51.202 --> 52:53.435
but this ride is $1.50.

52:53.437 --> 52:56.605
So you can pay that
or you can get your ass
off my bus.

52:56.607 --> 53:01.177
Okay. I just need to get as
far away from this gang
territory as possible.

53:01.179 --> 53:02.811
Really?

53:02.813 --> 53:05.447
If you want, I can sit down
and tell you the whole story.

53:05.449 --> 53:08.884
- No.
- No, no.
You don't have to get up.

53:08.886 --> 53:10.686
You ain't nothing
but a skinny crack whore.

53:10.688 --> 53:12.655
Now get your ass off my bus.

53:12.657 --> 53:15.958
I am not a crack whore.
I... I...

53:16.726 --> 53:18.861
- Hmm.
- Oh, that's...

53:18.863 --> 53:22.565
But this is... this is part of
that long story that I wanted
to tell you about.

53:22.567 --> 53:24.733
Okay, this...
Ugh! Yech!

53:30.540 --> 53:33.509
You did good.
You did good.

53:41.885 --> 53:43.819
All right, here it is.

53:43.821 --> 53:46.889
Could I conduct
the interviews this time?
Hey, knock yourself out.

53:46.891 --> 53:48.857
<i>X22.</i>

53:48.859 --> 53:50.492
Latest report
has Caucasian woman
in yellow dress...

53:50.494 --> 53:53.929
ejected
from municipal bus 32,
Western line.

53:53.931 --> 53:56.432
This sounds
like a psychotic break.

53:56.434 --> 53:58.467
That's pretty good there,
Dr. Phil.

53:58.469 --> 54:01.237
Uh, X22 responding.

54:01.239 --> 54:02.771
Hey, Dan.
Yeah.

54:02.773 --> 54:05.474
I'm just
working on the new
Granny Bandit story.

54:05.476 --> 54:08.410
Oh, Granny's old news.
I think we have
a better story brewing.

54:08.412 --> 54:10.946
The discord
at this year's
G8 summit?

54:10.948 --> 54:12.781
Don't be a smart-ass.

54:12.783 --> 54:14.583
The network is coming
to see Meghan today.

54:14.585 --> 54:17.286
- We have to do
a great show.
- Yeah.

54:17.288 --> 54:19.288
- Have you seen her yet?
- Nope.

54:19.290 --> 54:22.258
Did you try and call her?
Yes. Several times.

54:22.260 --> 54:24.560
All right, if you
were Meghan Miles,
where would you be?

54:36.006 --> 54:37.806
Nothing to see here.

54:55.826 --> 54:57.526
Lord?

55:08.705 --> 55:11.006
Hello.

55:11.008 --> 55:13.809
Hello. Hello. Hi.

55:13.811 --> 55:15.477
Oh.

55:15.479 --> 55:18.447
Hi.

55:18.449 --> 55:19.915
Can you help me?

55:22.619 --> 55:24.720
But this is a place
of worship, right?

55:24.722 --> 55:27.856
A house of God?
You're a rabbi.
No.

55:27.858 --> 55:29.858
Oh, you're not a...
Isn't that what they're
called?

55:29.860 --> 55:32.494
You're obviously a temptress
sent here to test my faith.

55:32.496 --> 55:34.029
Oh.

55:34.031 --> 55:37.032
Stimulation is
a distraction from,
and an offense to, God.

55:38.468 --> 55:40.703
And with an uncovered head.

55:40.705 --> 55:43.505
And this dress.

55:43.507 --> 55:46.508
I shouldn't look.
Okay, can you please just...
Please, just go.

55:46.510 --> 55:48.510
Come on.

55:48.512 --> 55:50.746
You're telling me
in this day and age,

55:50.748 --> 55:53.816
you're not going to let me use
the bathroom or make a call...

55:53.818 --> 55:55.884
or-or give me bus fare?

55:57.487 --> 55:59.788
Yeah, I just need...
I need $1.50.

55:59.790 --> 56:02.358
No, no. Look,
there are no women
allowed in there, okay?

56:02.360 --> 56:04.526
Women are kept separate
from the men.

56:04.528 --> 56:08.130
In fact, our men
aren't even allowed
to hear a woman sing.

56:08.132 --> 56:11.033
It's just bus fare.

56:11.035 --> 56:14.603
That's really all I need.
No one will know.

56:14.605 --> 56:16.772
There's no one here.
It's just us.

56:19.976 --> 56:22.544
Okay. Look, of all
the prohibitions,

56:22.546 --> 56:27.116
I love the female voice
mixing in the wind.

56:27.118 --> 56:29.485
The lilt.
The sweetness.

56:29.487 --> 56:31.019
Hmm.

56:31.021 --> 56:33.622
Now, I know I cannot touch.

56:34.991 --> 56:38.994
But can not my ears touch?

56:38.996 --> 56:43.065
A small price of $1.50
would eagerly be paid
for such a delight.

56:46.403 --> 56:48.036

I don't know.
She-She-She just appeared.

57:34.685 --> 57:36.618
She... She wants money.

57:36.620 --> 57:40.823

Okay, what is wrong with you?

You've got to have
some money in your pocket.
No, no, you can't!

57:50.767 --> 57:53.168

- Stop her!

Leave me alone.
Okay.

Hi. I'm Gordon.

58:21.832 --> 58:24.666

so not her type.
I get it though.

58:29.572 --> 58:32.541
What is this,
an artist loft?
Are you a hipster?

58:32.543 --> 58:35.210
Uh, no, not a hipster.
I can't grow
a convincing enough beard.

58:35.212 --> 58:38.580
- Oh, my God. A single man
with a cat. Wow.

58:38.582 --> 58:41.517
She's a rescue.
What a guy.

58:41.519 --> 58:43.051
Why do you look so familiar?

58:43.053 --> 58:45.020
I was also your bartender
last night.

58:45.022 --> 58:47.222
I gave you all your seven
or eight rounds of shots.

58:47.224 --> 58:50.859
Oh, so you, uh, stalk 'em,
you get 'em drunk,
then you take them home.

58:50.861 --> 58:53.862
That is not
how it happened, okay?
She needed help.

58:53.864 --> 58:56.565
I was trying to help her,
and we... well, we kind
of hit it off.

58:56.567 --> 58:58.800
Denise,
four-point douche test.
Go.

58:58.802 --> 59:01.803
What?
Have you ever been
to a strip club?

59:01.805 --> 59:03.939
Yes, but they
make me uncomfortable.

59:03.941 --> 59:06.041
What do you call
your penis?
My penis.

59:06.043 --> 59:08.577
- That's hot.
- Denise, Focus.

59:08.579 --> 59:11.680
Sorry. How do you feel
about Robert Pattinson?
Not my favorite actor.

59:11.682 --> 59:14.149
You shut your mouth.
Okay.

59:14.151 --> 59:15.984
Can I get
a "whoop, whoop"?
Whoop, whoop.

59:15.986 --> 59:17.686
No. Don't ever
do that again.

59:17.688 --> 59:23.091
Kill an innocent dog
or cheat on your girlfriend?
Cheat on my girlfriend.

59:23.093 --> 59:24.726
I'm not going to kill
an innocent dog.
That's sick.

59:24.728 --> 59:27.729
You passed.
Okay. So, we're good?

59:27.731 --> 59:29.631
- Can I get a hot chocolate?
- Not so fast.

59:29.633 --> 59:31.166

Where is she?

59:42.646 --> 59:45.080
Oh. Well, normally,
Meghan would be here
by now.

59:45.082 --> 59:48.984
But knowing Meghan,
she's out in the field
doing research.

59:54.591 --> 59:57.292
Daddy, look. Look.

59:57.294 --> 01:00:00.128

Okay, great.
Can you give me
Dan's number, please?

No, 'cause it's private.

No, no.
Okay, it's Meghan Miles.
From the news.

01:00:55.686 --> 01:00:58.186

is that you're Meghan Miles

You...

01:01:29.318 --> 01:01:33.221
So, you drove her home
in her car.
Yes. That's right.

01:01:33.223 --> 01:01:37.793
Why didn't you
take your car?
I don't have a car.

01:01:37.795 --> 01:01:40.962
You don't have a car
in the city of Los Angeles.
How do you get around?

01:01:40.964 --> 01:01:43.131
I take public
transportation mostly.

01:01:43.133 --> 01:01:44.933
I will take the bus
to work normally.

01:01:44.935 --> 01:01:46.968
Sometimes I take the subway.

01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:49.037
You son of a bitch!
You killed her!

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:51.406
Jesus!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Denise!

01:01:51.408 --> 01:01:54.743
He is lying to us.
There's no subway
in Los Angeles.

01:01:54.745 --> 01:01:56.812
- Yes, there is.
- Where?
How come I've never seen it?

01:01:56.814 --> 01:01:58.346
It's underground.

01:02:00.283 --> 01:02:02.184
Right. Okay.

01:02:03.086 --> 01:02:04.920
Sorry about that.

01:02:04.922 --> 01:02:07.022
Okay.
So, she left her phone.

01:02:07.024 --> 01:02:09.257
Uh, what else did she leave?

01:02:09.259 --> 01:02:13.261
She didn't come in with much.
She had her phone and
her keys. I had her keys.

01:02:13.263 --> 01:02:14.429
Well, where did you put them?

01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:15.671
Over by the door, on the table.

01:02:17.266 --> 01:02:21.002
The keys aren't here.
So she probably has her keys.

01:02:21.004 --> 01:02:23.271
She has her key?
That's great.

01:02:23.273 --> 01:02:25.073

It's a little thing

a little computer inside,

they can figure out
where the heck you are.

01:02:37.888 --> 01:02:42.157
Anyway,
I told Meghan about it.
She thought it was sensible.

01:02:42.159 --> 01:02:46.328
Let's call from the car,
see if the service number's
in there.

01:02:46.330 --> 01:02:48.263
No, no.
Wait a minute.
She just got a text.

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:51.199

Oh, my God.

one of those days...

just goes wrong?

how hard you try
or how good your intentions,

a friend right now.

- I'm not talking about
the details with you.
- Did she juggle your balls?

01:06:17.975 --> 01:06:20.141
Did she slap
you around a little bit,
tell you you're pretty?

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:21.710
Um...
'Cause you're pretty.

01:06:21.712 --> 01:06:25.113
You saw this little
in the yellow dress
steal your bike?

01:06:25.115 --> 01:06:27.415
She was really scary.

01:06:27.417 --> 01:06:30.385
- You got a good look at her?
- Yeah. She had these,
like, crazy eyes.

01:06:32.254 --> 01:06:33.555
All right, kid.
Come with us.

01:06:33.557 --> 01:06:35.323
Hop in.
We'll do a ride-along, okay?

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:37.592
But when we find her,

01:06:37.594 --> 01:06:40.061
I want five minutes alone
with her, okay?

01:06:40.063 --> 01:06:42.197
Not okay, creepy kid.

01:06:42.199 --> 01:06:43.598
Get in the back.
Be happy that you're coming.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.400
Just concentrate
on apprehending the perp.

01:06:45.402 --> 01:06:46.602
It's like the fucking <i>Goonies.</i>

01:06:48.637 --> 01:06:51.573
What? No.
I wouldn't want that
even if she'd agree to it.

01:06:51.575 --> 01:06:53.141
Why? Is that something
that you... like?

01:06:53.143 --> 01:06:54.776
It's just a pinky.

01:06:54.778 --> 01:07:01.182
<i>I can see that the key</i>
<i>is at Rossmore and Normandie.</i>
<i>But it seems to be moving.</i>

01:07:07.157 --> 01:07:09.324
<i>It's moving west on Normandie.</i>

01:07:09.326 --> 01:07:12.794
West on Normandie. Okay.
Great. Rose, go to Norton
and Wilshire.

01:07:12.796 --> 01:07:16.664
- I don't know where I am.
-  Three more blocks and then make a right.

01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:19.367
Hey, driver,
you got to go faster.
We have to find the bike.

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:22.637
It's "Officer." "Driver"?
What, your dad rich
or something?

01:07:22.639 --> 01:07:25.507
My dad's taxes pay your bills.
Find the bike.

01:07:25.509 --> 01:07:28.710
Kid, if you don't shut up,
I'm going to drop you off
right on this corner.

01:07:28.712 --> 01:07:30.645
God, I just want
to find my bike!

01:07:30.647 --> 01:07:32.714
And I just want
to be fucking fishing!

01:07:32.716 --> 01:07:35.083
Oh, my God.

01:07:35.085 --> 01:07:36.618
Oh, come on.
There you go.

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:38.253
You've really hurt
his feelings now.

01:07:38.255 --> 01:07:40.221
Well, the kid's an asshole.

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:42.524
<i>And here we are on the 101.</i>

01:07:42.526 --> 01:07:45.693
<i>Looking down on the gorgeous</i>
<i>San Fernando Valley,</i>

01:07:49.266 --> 01:07:50.832
<i>I worked the boom mic.</i>

01:07:50.834 --> 01:07:53.101
<i>But did that stop me</i>
<i>from getting gonorrhea?</i>

01:07:53.103 --> 01:07:58.706
<i>Any</i>
<i>available Rampart. Any</i>
<i>available Rampart. Come in.</i>

01:08:00.509 --> 01:08:03.378
- What are you smoking?
- It's an e-cig.

01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:05.447
Fake cigarette.
That's dumb.

01:08:05.449 --> 01:08:07.449
I smoke weed.

01:08:07.451 --> 01:08:09.150
Great.
Now we have to arrest you.

01:08:09.152 --> 01:08:11.820
- No. I was kidding.
- Well, you're already
in the back.

01:08:11.822 --> 01:08:14.089
- Why is this kid here?
- He's a witness.

01:08:14.091 --> 01:08:16.624
The yellow dress
is going to give her away.

01:08:16.626 --> 01:08:19.527
You...

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:20.795
Over there! Over there!
There she is.

01:08:20.796 --> 01:08:22.296
All right!
Make a U-turn. Hurry!

01:08:23.866 --> 01:08:26.201
Go back!
All right,
all right, relax!

01:08:30.238 --> 01:08:33.118
Come on! Drive faster!
Stop banging on the glass!

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:46.220
There it is!
I see the bike.

01:08:46.223 --> 01:08:48.288
Bingo.
She's here.

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:56.731
Stay in the car.
X22 pursuing suspect

01:08:56.733 --> 01:08:59.801
Entering parking lot,
corner of Vermont and Third.

01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:08.209
Miko, is that you? Come.

01:09:08.211 --> 01:09:09.777
- Uh...

01:09:09.779 --> 01:09:12.313
Oh, no.
Hello, hello.

01:09:15.317 --> 01:09:18.920
No. Uh, new girl.

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:21.221
Oh, new girl.

01:09:21.224 --> 01:09:23.224
Okay, let's do this.

01:09:23.225 --> 01:09:26.361
You know what to do?
God.

01:09:26.363 --> 01:09:28.529
I am never doing shots again.

01:09:28.532 --> 01:09:30.564
And use plenty of lube.

01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:40.241
X22, we are in pursuit

Oasis Spa.

01:09:40.243 --> 01:09:42.944
<i>- Copy that.</i>
- You. What you fellows want?

01:09:42.946 --> 01:09:44.612
Ma'am, we're in pursuit
of a suspect.

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:46.346
We just want to look around
a little bit.

01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:49.350
You're not my guy.
I took care
of my guy already.

01:09:49.352 --> 01:09:51.618
What does that mean, Walter?

01:09:51.621 --> 01:09:53.254
Don't worry about it.

01:09:54.356 --> 01:09:58.426
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I like.

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:02.430
Ohh!

01:10:02.432 --> 01:10:04.566
Oh, this is good.

01:10:07.304 --> 01:10:12.774
Okay, she stopped moving.
We got an address. Let's do
this. Let's go get her.

01:10:12.776 --> 01:10:15.210
No, no.
I go call my guy
at the station.

01:10:15.212 --> 01:10:17.212
My guy, Vic.
Okay?

01:10:17.214 --> 01:10:18.680
You know Vic?

01:10:18.682 --> 01:10:20.348
Hilarious.

01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:22.650
So, new girl, what's your name?

01:10:22.652 --> 01:10:25.687
Kim... Jong... Il.

01:10:25.689 --> 01:10:28.890
That's
beautiful name.
Listen.

01:10:28.892 --> 01:10:31.359
Can you push harder
on muscle, please?

01:10:31.361 --> 01:10:33.795
Yeah, yeah.
No, you tense. You tense.

01:10:33.797 --> 01:10:36.431
Oh, yeah.

01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:45.340
I chased her,
but better
I don't catch her.

01:10:45.342 --> 01:10:47.809
In this country,
you can't just kill.

01:10:47.811 --> 01:10:49.978
This is exciting.
Shh.

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:52.480
Kim.
Why you stop?
Shh, shh, shh.

01:10:52.482 --> 01:10:55.583
Ah, ah. You... No, no.
You tense.
You so tense.

01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:57.418
Uh... Shh.
Good. Yeah.

Shh.

01:11:13.569 --> 01:11:15.737
Shit.
Oh, oh...

01:11:15.739 --> 01:11:16.938
- Ohh!

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:18.406
What was that?

01:11:20.443 --> 01:11:22.644
Kim.

01:11:23.612 --> 01:11:24.779
You!

01:11:27.851 --> 01:11:29.851
This way.
I'm coming.
I got you covered.

01:11:33.322 --> 01:11:35.590
Other side.
I could kick it down.

01:11:35.592 --> 01:11:38.059
- Other side. Other side.

Oh, you scared me.

01:13:07.117 --> 01:13:08.850

What are you doing here?

01:13:10.653 --> 01:13:13.488
Uh, I need to get
across the freeway.

01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:15.757
Underpass about a mile down.

01:13:15.759 --> 01:13:17.658
No, no.
I don't have to go that far.

01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:22.630
Uh, the freeway's empty.
There won't be any cars
till 4:00 p.m.

01:13:22.632 --> 01:13:25.933
I could maybe
let you cross here.

01:13:25.935 --> 01:13:27.402
Great.

01:13:27.404 --> 01:13:29.604
For a toll.

01:13:29.606 --> 01:13:31.672
A toll?
I have nothing.

01:13:31.674 --> 01:13:33.441
I have no money.
I have no...

01:13:33.443 --> 01:13:35.143
I like those.

01:13:36.912 --> 01:13:39.647

I just got these.
They're a nice color.

<i>Where's Meghan Miles?</i>

01:14:09.011 --> 01:14:11.179

01:14:11.181 --> 01:14:13.648
<i>Dan, are you watching this?</i>
Yeah, Steve.

01:14:13.650 --> 01:14:16.083
Oh, my God. There's
a woman in a yellow dress
trying to cross the freeway.

01:14:16.085 --> 01:14:17.785
Freeze!

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:20.054
Put your hands
in the air!
Freeze!

01:14:20.056 --> 01:14:22.657
Get down on the ground!
Put your hands
behind your back.

01:14:22.659 --> 01:14:24.192
Hands back.
Hands in the air!

01:14:24.194 --> 01:14:27.094
- Hands up or hands down?
- Do not move.

01:14:27.096 --> 01:14:30.097
- Let me see your hands.
- Dave, stop talking
about her hands.

01:14:30.099 --> 01:14:32.533
- Sorry, Walter.
- I got this.
Just let me handle this.

01:14:32.535 --> 01:14:35.002
- Don't move. Don't move.
- We got her, Walter.
We got her.

01:14:35.004 --> 01:14:37.738
- We got her.
- Game over, ma'am.

01:14:39.608 --> 01:14:40.775
Stop!
Shit!

01:14:40.777 --> 01:14:41.943
I knew it.
Ma'am, stop!

01:14:41.945 --> 01:14:43.544
Come on, Dave.
Come on.

01:14:43.546 --> 01:14:45.112
No!
Don't, don't, don't!

01:14:52.187 --> 01:14:53.721
Ohh!

01:14:53.723 --> 01:14:55.790
Oh, my God.
She made it.

01:14:55.792 --> 01:14:57.825
Jesus Christ,
she's an Olympian.

01:14:57.827 --> 01:15:00.862
Walter,
she's getting away!
Sorry!

01:15:00.864 --> 01:15:02.597
Walter, we're stuck.
That chick is a psycho.

01:15:02.599 --> 01:15:04.265
Good job, Steve.
Keep on her.

01:15:04.267 --> 01:15:06.000
<i>I'm on it.</i>
<i>No, lost her.</i>

01:15:14.943 --> 01:15:16.611
Suckers.

01:15:38.967 --> 01:15:41.702
Boop-boop.

01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:44.939
Do not call. Don't tell Vic!
I won't tell Vic,
but I got to call it in.

01:15:44.941 --> 01:15:46.240
I will fucking shoot you.

01:15:46.242 --> 01:15:48.609
You left your purse
in your car?
Yes.

01:15:48.611 --> 01:15:50.745
And your shoes too?

01:15:50.747 --> 01:15:55.049
Um, I don't see what the shoes
have to do with anything.

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:57.885
Okay, I cannot
let you in that car
without payment.

01:15:57.887 --> 01:16:00.655
I have the key!

01:16:00.657 --> 01:16:02.723
It's right here.

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:04.292
- Look.
- Boop-boop.

01:16:04.294 --> 01:16:07.328
See the boop?
You can't block a boop-boop
with your hand.

01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:10.631
Boop-boop.
Look. Turn around.
You'll see it boop-booping.

01:16:10.633 --> 01:16:12.900
Mm-mmm. I'm not going
to fall for this.
Could be a trick.

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:15.336
What kind of trick?

01:16:15.338 --> 01:16:17.338
What am I, a magician?

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:19.840
You need to calm down.
I'm trying to help you.

01:16:19.842 --> 01:16:22.276
You are?
Yeah.

01:16:22.278 --> 01:16:24.879
Really?
Yeah.

01:16:24.881 --> 01:16:27.949
Now, what is the address...

01:16:27.951 --> 01:16:31.152
from where "your" car was towed?

01:16:31.154 --> 01:16:32.853
Okay. Yes.

01:16:32.855 --> 01:16:36.657
It was, um...
Okay, well, it's not...

01:16:36.659 --> 01:16:38.626
it's not my address,

01:16:38.628 --> 01:16:43.064
um, because I was visiting
a friend at the time
of the towing.

01:16:44.666 --> 01:16:48.102
He was a...
It was a new friend.

01:16:49.071 --> 01:16:51.038
Naughty.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:55.009
Are you telling me
that there's no way...

01:16:55.011 --> 01:16:58.846
that I could go to my car
without my license...

01:16:58.848 --> 01:17:02.183
and get my wallet
which has my money?

01:17:02.185 --> 01:17:04.118
You see what I'm laying down?

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:06.320
You see
what I'm putting down?
I'm putting that down.

01:17:07.623 --> 01:17:10.224
Are you trying to bribe me?

01:17:10.226 --> 01:17:12.827
No.
That's a shame.

01:17:12.829 --> 01:17:16.731
Because I was thinking
I might want Quiznos
for lunch today.

01:17:16.733 --> 01:17:19.967
- How much?
- $500.

01:17:19.969 --> 01:17:24.372
Quiznos does not cost...
$500?
It does for me.

01:17:24.374 --> 01:17:26.307
Okay, you are going
to let me into my car.
Hands off of there.

01:17:26.309 --> 01:17:28.743
You are going to let me
into my car!
Hands off.

01:17:28.745 --> 01:17:30.878
Stop it.
Get your hands
off the glass.

01:17:31.847 --> 01:17:33.814
Stop it.
No.

01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:36.283
I can see it!
It's right there.

01:17:36.285 --> 01:17:38.252
Hands off
the glass.
Get out of here.

01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:41.889
Give me my car.
It's right there.

01:18:37.179 --> 01:18:40.381
No, not my purse!
My purse. No! No! No!

01:18:43.218 --> 01:18:45.286
No.

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:05.005
Fuck this.

01:19:10.445 --> 01:19:13.247
Yes. Yeah!
Suck it, lady!

01:19:19.354 --> 01:19:21.088
Oh!

01:19:24.092 --> 01:19:28.195
Come on. Go. Come on. Go.
Come on. Go, go, go, go.
Come on. Come on.

01:19:30.298 --> 01:19:33.200
No, no, no, no, no.

01:19:39.207 --> 01:19:40.908
Gotcha.

01:19:45.814 --> 01:19:47.982
I know you.

01:19:47.984 --> 01:19:51.152
You're stuck again.
You gonna...

01:19:51.154 --> 01:19:53.988
Hi. I'm Gordon. I'm...
From last night.

01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:55.156
How you doing?
How you doing?

01:19:55.158 --> 01:19:56.957
Any chance you
can pop the sunroof?

01:19:56.959 --> 01:19:59.226
Yeah. Uh-huh.

01:20:01.997 --> 01:20:03.464
All right, a little more.

01:20:03.466 --> 01:20:04.965
Hi.

01:20:04.967 --> 01:20:06.267
Watch yourself.

01:20:10.138 --> 01:20:13.073
Let's get you out of here.
Apparently, you have
some news to deliver.

01:20:13.075 --> 01:20:15.109
How did you know?
What are you...

01:20:15.111 --> 01:20:16.443
I know everything.
Hi.

01:20:16.445 --> 01:20:18.979
Where's your car?
I don't have a car.

01:20:18.981 --> 01:20:20.114
What?
I know, I know.

01:20:20.116 --> 01:20:21.949
Damn, what did you
do to yourself?

01:20:21.951 --> 01:20:23.884
What did you do to my dress?

01:20:23.886 --> 01:20:27.121
How did you guys find me?
You got to get me out of here.

01:20:27.123 --> 01:20:29.390
Okay, tell me what's going on.

01:20:29.392 --> 01:20:31.926
I can't believe
you guys are here.
You guys are...

01:20:31.928 --> 01:20:33.928
- We did it!
- God, you're alive!

01:20:33.930 --> 01:20:35.996
I can't believe we found you.

01:20:35.998 --> 01:20:37.498
Thank you, guys.
I love you so much.

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:41.035
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

01:20:41.037 --> 01:20:44.538
How did you find me?
I got your friends
and your G.P.S.

01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:48.175
- Your Keytective thing.
- Oh, my God!
Keytective!

01:20:48.177 --> 01:20:50.144
My commercial.
You thought of that?

01:20:50.146 --> 01:20:54.615
I know.
Do you want me to sing it?
No, don't sing it.

01:20:54.617 --> 01:20:57.351
- Okay, I'm so sorry
that I left.
- No, no. It's okay.

01:20:57.353 --> 01:20:59.086
I don't have a bigger
regret in my life.

01:20:59.088 --> 01:21:01.922
It led to <i> the </i> most insane...

01:21:01.924 --> 01:21:04.892
I don't do this sort
of thing at all.
It's okay.

01:21:04.894 --> 01:21:07.862
Guys, I hate
to interrupt your second date,
cause it's really cute,

01:21:07.864 --> 01:21:12.299
<i>Suspect in yellow dress...</i>

01:21:12.301 --> 01:21:13.934
<i>spotted entering black S.U.V.</i>
<i>moving east on Wilshire.</i>

01:21:13.936 --> 01:21:15.436
Bingo. We got her.

01:21:15.438 --> 01:21:17.004
Who has my phone?
He does.
I got it.

01:21:17.006 --> 01:21:18.272
I got it.

01:21:22.311 --> 01:21:24.478
Meghan.
Where the hell are you?

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:27.047
Yeah, yeah. I'm on my way.
Have hair and makeup
standing by.

01:21:27.049 --> 01:21:28.582
They're ready. They're ready.
Get here.

01:21:28.584 --> 01:21:31.318
And can you connect me
to an outside line?

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:34.088
Hey there. I saw your ad
on Swinging Singles.

01:21:34.090 --> 01:21:38.125
Let me ask you something.
How can you be that hot,
that young and that single?

01:21:38.127 --> 01:21:40.461
Sorry. Got to go.
Duty calls.

01:21:40.463 --> 01:21:42.463
Lady, get out of the way!

01:21:42.465 --> 01:21:45.566
Does the fucking siren
not mean anything to you?

01:21:45.568 --> 01:21:47.001
Meghan Miles,
This is Chopper Steve,
setting down.

01:21:47.003 --> 01:21:49.503
Okay! I got to go.

01:21:49.505 --> 01:21:51.305
I'll give you a call.
I got to do the news.

01:21:51.307 --> 01:21:53.240
Good luck!
No. You come.

01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:54.975
I'm not good with helicopters.

01:21:54.977 --> 01:21:58.045
Good luck, Meghan!
You're gonna be great!
Kill it!

01:21:58.047 --> 01:22:00.014
We love you, Meghan!

01:22:00.016 --> 01:22:02.349
Christ on a piece
of halibut!
What happened to you?

01:22:02.351 --> 01:22:03.651
I need to get to the station.

01:22:03.653 --> 01:22:07.354
There's a girl
in a yellow dress out there
who almost got killed.

01:22:07.356 --> 01:22:09.123
Yeah, yeah. That's nuts.
Let's go.

01:22:09.125 --> 01:22:10.324
Let's cut some sky.

01:22:10.692 --> 01:22:12.459
Meghan!

01:22:12.461 --> 01:22:15.062
We love you, Meghan!
Good luck, Meghan!

01:22:15.064 --> 01:22:18.065
You're gonna be great!
Read that news!

01:22:18.067 --> 01:22:19.433
It's so exciting!

01:22:21.370 --> 01:22:24.638
Let me do all the talking.
No, opposite, opposite.

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:28.575
Ma'am, did you see
a woman in a yellow dress
get on that helicopter?

01:22:28.577 --> 01:22:30.678
I saw Meghan Miles,

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:35.716
undercover investigator
for KZLA,
get on a helicopter.

01:22:35.718 --> 01:22:38.285
Wait. The woman we're chasing
is just a reporter?

01:22:39.587 --> 01:22:41.455
Dear God, it's worse
than we ever imagined.

01:22:41.457 --> 01:22:43.557
The hooker has
infiltrated the media,

01:22:43.559 --> 01:22:45.693
where she's posing
as KZLA's Meghan Miles.

01:22:45.695 --> 01:22:49.029
What do you mean,
she's infiltrated
the media?

01:22:49.031 --> 01:22:53.033
So, you're saying
that our best friend Meghan
is an undercover hooker?

01:22:53.035 --> 01:22:54.568
It looks that way.

01:22:54.570 --> 01:22:56.537
So, you have
an idiot friend too?
Yeah. Mine's by choice.

01:22:56.539 --> 01:22:58.472
You got stuck
with this guy, right?

01:22:58.474 --> 01:23:01.308
We have her! Let's move!

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:04.044
Oh, my God, honey.

01:23:04.046 --> 01:23:06.613
There's too much to do.
Let's get her on the chair.

01:23:06.615 --> 01:23:09.984
Hurry up. Triage.
People, we don't have
much time.

01:23:15.457 --> 01:23:17.391
Go, go, go, go, go.
Let's go.

01:23:17.393 --> 01:23:19.560
Ten seconds to air.
Come on.

01:23:19.562 --> 01:23:24.398
All right,
this is gonna be great.
It's up to me, right?

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:26.000
<i>And now, here's Meghan Miles</i>
<i>with your news.</i>

01:23:26.002 --> 01:23:27.267
- Perfect.
- In three, two, one.

01:23:27.269 --> 01:23:28.702
All right, get out!

01:23:30.505 --> 01:23:33.307
<i>Good evening.</i>
<i>I'm Meghan Miles.</i>

01:23:33.309 --> 01:23:35.642
<i>Our top story... a woman</i>
<i>authorities describe...</i>

01:23:35.644 --> 01:23:38.345
<i>as a bitter</i>
<i>and deranged prostitute</i>
<i>in a yellow dress...</i>

01:23:38.347 --> 01:23:41.382
<i>is rampaging through our city.</i>

01:23:41.384 --> 01:23:43.484
<i>This hooker hoodlum's...</i>

01:23:44.753 --> 01:23:46.620
<i>Uh...</i>

01:23:46.622 --> 01:23:49.490
<i>This working girl's</i>
<i>sinister spree...</i>

01:23:49.492 --> 01:23:52.092
<i>began with a dispute</i>
<i>with an immigrant cabdriver...</i>

01:23:52.094 --> 01:23:53.727
<i>and would include</i>
<i>evading police,</i>

01:23:53.729 --> 01:23:59.633
<i>distributing crack cocaine</i>
<i>and possible hate crimes.</i>

01:24:01.770 --> 01:24:03.537
Oh.

01:24:05.273 --> 01:24:08.609
<i>In other news...</i>

01:24:08.611 --> 01:24:12.780
<i>You know, I know</i>
<i>I'm only supposed</i>
<i>to read the news today.</i>

01:24:12.782 --> 01:24:20.521
<i>I... can't read this story</i>
<i>because I know</i>
<i>that it's not true.</i>

01:24:20.523 --> 01:24:22.423
Huh?

01:24:22.425 --> 01:24:26.326
<i>Because...</i>
<i>this story's about me.</i>

01:24:26.328 --> 01:24:29.096
<i>I'm... I am the Hooker Hoodlum.</i>

01:24:29.098 --> 01:24:30.831
<i>Look. Look. It's me.</i>

01:24:30.833 --> 01:24:33.067
<i>The yellow dress and the...</i>

01:24:33.069 --> 01:24:35.369
<i>I'm the breaking story.</i>

01:24:35.371 --> 01:24:38.238
<i>Yeah. I'm your news at 5:00.</i>
<i>You're, uh...</i>

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:40.340
<i>Look at this, huh?</i>

01:24:40.342 --> 01:24:42.676
<i>The bad guy of the hour.</i>

01:24:44.245 --> 01:24:46.080
<i>Shall we dig a little deeper?</i>

01:24:46.082 --> 01:24:47.581
<i>Hooker Hoodlum. Hmm.</i>

01:24:47.583 --> 01:24:50.417
<i>Hooker. Yes.</i>

01:24:50.419 --> 01:24:52.753
<i>I woke up in a stranger's bed.</i>

01:24:52.755 --> 01:24:55.422
<i>A lovely, lovely stranger.</i>

01:24:56.691 --> 01:24:59.259
<i>And I had to endure</i>
<i>a really weird,</i>

01:24:59.261 --> 01:25:02.596
<i>very long...</i>
<i>walk of shame.</i>

01:25:02.598 --> 01:25:06.300
<i>Look at these feet.</i>
<i>This is how much</i>
<i>I walked right here.</i>

01:25:06.302 --> 01:25:08.702
<i>But I am not a hooker.</i>

01:25:08.704 --> 01:25:11.338
<i>Which I have said repeatedly</i>
<i>all evening long.</i>

01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:14.174
<i>Also, I'm not ashamed.</i>
<i>I shouldn't have called it</i>
<i>a walk of shame.</i>

01:25:14.176 --> 01:25:15.709
<i>Not ashamed.</i>

01:25:15.711 --> 01:25:17.811
<i>And I don't care</i>
<i>what people think anymore,</i>

01:25:17.813 --> 01:25:21.181
<i>because it is exhausting.</i>

01:25:21.183 --> 01:25:25.786
So let's just let the shame
lie with everyone...

01:25:25.788 --> 01:25:29.189
<i>who took one look</i>
<i>at a girl in a... in a...</i>

01:25:29.191 --> 01:25:34.294
<i>in this... I mean, this is not,</i>
<i>I agree, the most</i>
<i>conservative outfit,</i>

01:25:34.296 --> 01:25:38.565
<i>but this should not</i>
<i>automatically make me</i>
<i>a pariah or prey.</i>

01:25:38.567 --> 01:25:40.567
Meghan, Have you lost your mind?

01:25:40.569 --> 01:25:42.703
<i>The point is that</i>
<i>everything I did,</i>

01:25:42.705 --> 01:25:45.839
<i>I did because I was trying</i>
<i>to get back here...</i>

01:25:45.841 --> 01:25:50.444
<i>so that I could convince</i>
<i>a few people...</i>

01:25:50.446 --> 01:25:53.347
<i>that I am someone</i>
<i>that I no longer am.</i>

01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:57.818
<i>I am not safe or perfect.</i>

01:25:59.754 --> 01:26:01.488
<i>And if I'm going</i>
<i>to tell you the news,</i>

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:03.891
<i>I should be telling</i>
<i>the real story...</i>

01:26:03.893 --> 01:26:06.860
<i>and not just reading</i>
<i>this dumb script.</i>

01:26:06.862 --> 01:26:09.196
<i>Dan, I'm sorry.</i>

01:26:09.198 --> 01:26:11.832
<i>You're the best.</i>
<i>You've been nothing</i>
<i>but the best to me.</i>

01:26:11.834 --> 01:26:13.734
<i>And you're gonna</i>
<i>haul me out of here.</i>
<i>So real quick.</i>

01:26:13.736 --> 01:26:17.437
<i>I just need to say that Kyle,</i>
<i>I never want to see you again.</i>

01:26:17.439 --> 01:26:22.509
I'm so glad I dumped her.
<i>Don't call me.</i>
<i>I won't call you.</i>

01:26:22.511 --> 01:26:26.313
We traced your number
from a recovered cell phone
used by a drug syndicate.

01:26:26.315 --> 01:26:29.616
<i>Rose and Denise,</i>
<i>thank you more...</i>

01:26:29.618 --> 01:26:31.718
<i>for being my friends</i>
<i>and coming to get me.</i>

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:35.189
We did good.
We crushed it.

01:26:35.191 --> 01:26:37.891
- Hey, is it too early for shots?
-  Hell to the no.

01:26:37.893 --> 01:26:40.627
What are you still doing here?

01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:43.764
<i>And, um...</i>
<i>New guy, Gordon. Hey.</i>

01:26:43.766 --> 01:26:48.869
So, I'm
a little bit crazy.

01:26:48.871 --> 01:26:50.771
Also, you looked
really good in this dress.
I just remembered that part.

01:26:50.773 --> 01:26:52.372
And one last thing.

01:26:52.374 --> 01:26:53.907
<i>A big shout out to my boys...</i>

01:26:53.909 --> 01:26:55.943
<i>Scrilla, Hulk</i>
<i>and especially Pookie.</i>

01:26:55.945 --> 01:26:57.611
Aw!
Aw!

01:26:57.613 --> 01:26:59.813
What I'd tell ya?
What?

01:26:59.815 --> 01:27:04.918
<i>And his uncle in chinos.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, I don't remember</i>
<i>the rest, Pooks.</i>

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:07.254
What?
That's my bitch
from the news.

01:27:07.256 --> 01:27:09.356
<i>That's the news.</i>
<i>I'm Meghan Miles.</i>

01:27:09.358 --> 01:27:10.924
<i>Be well or, you know, whatever.</i>

01:27:10.926 --> 01:27:13.393
<i>Just...</i>

01:27:13.395 --> 01:27:15.862
<i>Just be yourself.</i>
<i>I mean, just...</i>

01:27:15.864 --> 01:27:17.698
Okay. Thanks, Dan.

01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:19.866
- Good luck, Chuck.
-  - Chuck, move to Meghan's chair.

01:27:19.868 --> 01:27:21.501
I think we should
get out of here.

01:27:21.503 --> 01:27:22.836
Maybe we should go.
Yeah, I think we should.

01:27:22.838 --> 01:27:25.305
<i>Meghan Miles,</i>
<i>you will be missed.</i>

01:27:25.307 --> 01:27:27.608
<i>Good day, Los Angeles.</i>
<i>I'm Chuck Rogers.</i>

01:27:27.610 --> 01:27:29.676
You know what happened.
I'm not crazy.

01:27:29.678 --> 01:27:31.712
Meghan.
 No, what was crazy about that?

01:27:33.348 --> 01:27:36.383
Incredible.
Yeah,
I'm really sorry.

01:27:36.385 --> 01:27:38.552
You should hire Chang.

01:27:38.554 --> 01:27:41.288
I mean, what an incredible
idea for an investigative
series.

01:27:41.290 --> 01:27:44.324
The girl in the yellow dress.

01:27:44.326 --> 01:27:47.361
Right. But you know
I didn't plan that.
It was just what happened.

01:27:47.363 --> 01:27:49.496
Even better. Like
<i>To Catch A Predator </i> meets...

01:27:49.498 --> 01:27:53.500
Tyra Banks in a fat suit
meets <i> Undercover Millionaire.</i>
It's fresh.

01:27:53.502 --> 01:27:57.771
Meghan, I know there's
something we can do together
at the network.

01:27:57.773 --> 01:28:01.541
- What are we talking about?
- It's a reality show.

01:28:01.543 --> 01:28:03.577
- I love it.
- Love it.

01:28:03.579 --> 01:28:07.648
- Reality?
- Your call.

01:28:07.650 --> 01:28:11.051
I need to think about it
and get back to you.

01:28:11.053 --> 01:28:12.753
Dan here can get
the ball rolling.

01:28:12.755 --> 01:28:14.721
I just need a pair of shoes.

01:28:14.723 --> 01:28:17.591
Maybe a sandwich.
Get you some shoes.
Oh, some food too.

01:28:17.593 --> 01:28:19.026
Maybe brush my teeth.
Right?

01:28:19.028 --> 01:28:20.727
No, no, you're fine.

01:28:20.729 --> 01:28:23.397
Just do some hair fixing.
I got your back,
Meghan.

01:28:23.399 --> 01:28:25.699
So, what do you have
in mind for us?

01:28:25.701 --> 01:28:28.902
- You two are a package?
- Yeah, I'm her producer.

01:28:28.904 --> 01:28:30.537
How much to go away?

01:28:30.539 --> 01:28:32.673
Hey, babe.
There he is.
Arrest him.

01:28:32.675 --> 01:28:34.308
Sir, we need you to stand up,
put your hands behind your back.

01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:35.976
What are you talking about?

01:28:35.978 --> 01:28:37.377
Put your cookies down.
Let's go.

01:28:37.379 --> 01:28:38.378
What are you doing,
arresting me?

01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:40.314
For what?
Being too sexy? Ow!

01:28:42.684 --> 01:28:46.053
So, your place or mine?
Yeah. Um...

01:28:48.022 --> 01:28:49.823
I'd love to show you mine.

01:28:49.825 --> 01:28:51.892
It's very empty,
but it has a bed.

01:28:51.894 --> 01:28:53.727
Nice. How are we
going to get there?

01:28:53.729 --> 01:28:55.429
Ooh, I have not thought of that.

01:28:55.431 --> 01:28:57.631
Uh, maybe we should
take that cab.
No. No, no.

01:28:57.633 --> 01:28:59.066
No time for that.
No, it's not.

01:28:59.068 --> 01:29:00.801
I never wanna see
a cab again.
Okay.

01:29:06.474 --> 01:29:08.542
We're gonna walk.
That's fine with me.

01:29:08.544 --> 01:29:10.544
This will be more
of an adventure.
