[applause]

00:20.870 --> 00:24.170
- From the Penn & Teller
Theater in Las Vegas, Nevada,

00:24.170 --> 00:31.930
here's your host, Jonathan Ross.
[applause]

00:39.270 --> 00:41.970
- Welcome to <i>Penn & Teller:
Fool Us.</i>

00:41.970 --> 00:44.800
Now, tonight we will see some
of the best magicians in the

00:44.800 --> 00:48.070
world, and the fun part is
you'll see it all exactly as it

00:48.070 --> 00:50.870
happens.
It's like Miley Cyrus twerking.

00:50.870 --> 00:54.170
It's all out there for
everyone to enjoy.

00:54.170 --> 00:59.400
[laughter]
[applause]

00:59.400 --> 01:01.470
So you can see everything, but
the eyes that matter most belong

01:01.470 --> 01:04.230
to the stars of our show.
There are four beady eyes and

01:04.230 --> 01:06.570
just one booming voice.
Here they are.

01:06.570 --> 01:08.600
It's the fabulous Penn and
Teller!

01:08.600 --> 01:23.800
[applause]
Now, people who've seen this

01:23.800 --> 01:27.370
show will know that when you
talk to the acts after they've

01:27.370 --> 01:29.600
performed, you talk in a kind of
code.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.900
It's a sort of a magician's
language that you're using, so

01:31.900 --> 01:34.430
you don't give away too much
for the rest of us and spoil

01:34.430 --> 01:35.930
some of the tricks in the
future.

01:35.930 --> 01:38.500
How many of these kind of secret
little kind of ways of

01:38.500 --> 01:40.600
describing things do you know?
- Well, we're kind of making

01:40.600 --> 01:45.430
them up as we go, you know.
My goal--our goal is to give an

01:45.430 --> 01:48.700
amateur magician or maybe
children who are studying magic

01:48.700 --> 01:51.230
enough information that they
can search around and dig

01:51.230 --> 01:53.530
around and go in their
libraries, and then go back and

01:53.530 --> 01:56.200
watch it again to figure out
what really went on, but those

01:56.200 --> 02:00.130
who want to just watch a live
magic show done real can also do

02:00.130 --> 02:03.500
that without having the illusion
crumbled, so we're trying to

02:03.500 --> 02:05.530
walk a little bit of a tight
wire there.

02:05.530 --> 02:07.030
- And you're doing it
fantastically.

02:07.030 --> 02:08.830
Teller, I would ask you a
question but you know what it's

02:08.830 --> 02:10.500
like.
Once he starts talking, he

02:10.500 --> 02:13.800
never shuts up, so maybe, maybe
we'll talk later instead.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.370
If you'd like to take your
seats, gentlemen, the show

02:15.370 --> 02:20.300
can begin.
[applause]

02:20.300 --> 02:23.070
Penn and Teller, ladies and
gentlemen.

02:23.070 --> 02:29.100
It's time to start the show.
Let's meet our first magician.

02:29.100 --> 02:31.730
- Hi, I'm Kostya Kimlat.
A business-focused magician

02:31.730 --> 02:34.300
specializing in sleight of hand
magic.

02:34.300 --> 02:37.000
My company trains and books
magicians around the world for

02:37.000 --> 02:40.430
all kinds of corporate events.
Over the years, I started to see

02:40.430 --> 02:43.470
the connections between the art
of magic and the craft of

02:43.470 --> 02:46.500
business.
A sale, just like a magic trick,

02:46.500 --> 02:49.930
happens in the customer's mind.
It's all about perception, and

02:49.930 --> 02:52.730
that means human interaction.
How do we communicate?

02:52.730 --> 02:55.000
Those are the real secrets of
magic.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.770
Great magic doesn't start to
fool you so that you believe in

02:57.770 --> 03:01.400
something, great magic reminds
you to be careful about what

03:01.400 --> 03:03.270
you believe in.
And that's why it can be so

03:03.270 --> 03:05.430
helpful to think like a
magician.

03:05.430 --> 03:12.400
[applause]
- Our next performer has been

03:12.400 --> 03:15.970
known to teach businessmen to
think like a magician, like they

03:15.970 --> 03:18.230
need any help in making people's
money disappear.

03:18.230 --> 03:21.030
Will you please welcome
Kostya Kimlat.

03:21.030 --> 03:28.200
[applause]
- Thank you very very much.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.670
It's an absolute pleasure to be
here with all of you in the

03:30.670 --> 03:32.900
theater and everyone watching at
home.

03:32.900 --> 03:36.030
Penn, Teller, I'd like to show
you something special using a

03:36.030 --> 03:38.070
pack of playing cards.
Will you please join me so you

03:38.070 --> 03:40.370
can watch closely?
Everyone welcome Penn and

03:40.370 --> 03:42.630
Teller.
[applause]

03:42.630 --> 03:44.600
How are you gentlemen?
What a pleasure.

03:44.600 --> 03:48.200
So nice, so nice.
So please have a seat and relax.

03:48.200 --> 03:51.230
In a moment, you're going to
help me shuffle these cards.

03:51.230 --> 03:55.430
Now I've found that how people
shuffle cards depends on which

03:55.430 --> 03:57.630
part of the world they've come
from.

03:57.630 --> 04:00.830
Now we have 52 playing cards.
We've taken the jokers out.

04:00.830 --> 04:02.730
Now I don't know if you have a
preferred way of shuffling the

04:02.730 --> 04:05.000
cards but I'd like to give you
about half of the cards.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.870
Mix those up
as much as you like.

04:06.870 --> 04:08.800
And you can mix them up, too.
Maybe you can help me do this.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.170
Can you wash them here on the
table?

04:10.170 --> 04:12.330
Like this, yeah.
Now the hardest part, of course,

04:12.330 --> 04:14.970
is collecting all those cards,
so we're going to square all of

04:14.970 --> 04:17.269
these cards up.
And you feel those are pretty

04:17.269 --> 04:19.269
well-shuffled for yourself as
well?

04:19.269 --> 04:20.829
Thank you, Teller.
I'm going to spread these face

04:20.829 --> 04:22.370
up.
And then I'm going to do kind

04:22.370 --> 04:25.300
of a crazy shuffle, okay?
I'm going to turn these face

04:25.300 --> 04:30.970
down, and I'm going to shuffle
them together but before I push

04:30.970 --> 04:33.830
them in, I want you to see the
state that they're in,

04:33.830 --> 04:35.730
all right?
Very well mixed up.

04:35.730 --> 04:37.430
And then Teller, if you would
take your hand and place it like

04:37.430 --> 04:39.430
this for me if you would.
Yeah.

04:39.430 --> 04:41.230
And then can you place your
hand--place it above.

04:41.230 --> 04:43.070
And press the cards together.
That way you not only see them

04:43.070 --> 04:45.400
all the way down the line, you
actually feel them being

04:45.400 --> 04:46.770
shuffled.
And all the way, all the way,

04:46.770 --> 04:49.030
working so effortlessly as you
do together.

04:49.030 --> 04:50.930
- We're such a team.
- You are, I love it.

04:50.930 --> 04:53.870
[laughter]
Perfect. Perfect shuffle.

04:53.870 --> 04:56.470
- You should see us shampoo
together.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.300
- Now look, would you agree
those are really well-mixed?

04:58.300 --> 05:01.870
- Yeah, I would, unfortunately.
- Now I'll say this.

05:01.870 --> 05:05.870
There is only one other shuffle
that mixes the cards in a more

05:05.870 --> 05:08.900
thorough way.
And this is a shuffle that is

05:08.900 --> 05:12.730
preferred by children and
drunks.

05:12.730 --> 05:14.800
Like that. Okay?
Now, who even drops them on the

05:14.800 --> 05:16.170
floor?
It doesn't matter.

05:16.170 --> 05:17.930
The cards are
completely mixed up.

05:17.930 --> 05:19.570
In fact, why don't you guys get
in there.

05:19.570 --> 05:21.130
Feel like a kid again.
I want you to go ahead, turn

05:21.130 --> 05:23.700
them over, mix up, face up,
face down, do whatever you like.

05:23.700 --> 05:26.200
Give them a nice little mix.
You feel pretty good about that?

05:26.200 --> 05:28.370
- Actually, it's starting to
make me feel worse and worse,

05:28.370 --> 05:29.970
I'm just telling you.
- Oh, okay, okay.

05:29.970 --> 05:31.400
Pretty good, pretty good.
Okay, cool, so we'll collect.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.130
And that's fine. That's perfect.
I'm going to gather up the cards

05:33.130 --> 05:35.230
together, and gentlemen, this
is my favorite part.

05:35.230 --> 05:41.070
Even though the cards have been
thoroughly mixed--

05:41.070 --> 05:42.470
- I'm going to break your
hands.

05:42.470 --> 05:44.070
- No, no, no, no.
Even though they're mixed, I'm

05:44.070 --> 05:47.970
going to find your two cards
which is really impressive

05:47.970 --> 05:49.430
because you haven't
even picked them yet.

05:49.430 --> 05:50.870
- That's true.
- I get excited by the shuffle,

05:50.870 --> 05:53.030
okay?
So let's do this here.

05:53.030 --> 05:55.170
I'll go through here face up or
face down.

05:55.170 --> 05:56.630
Here's what I can do.
Reach in there and grab one

05:56.630 --> 05:59.330
out, face up or face down.
It's your choice.

05:59.330 --> 06:01.530
It's absolutely your choice.
Face up. Thank you so much.

06:01.530 --> 06:03.830
I really appreciate that.
I got it.

06:03.830 --> 06:05.730
Truthfully, it doesn't matter
what the card is.

06:05.730 --> 06:08.200
If I know it, it's okay.
What matters is which

06:08.200 --> 06:09.670
way you take it out.
So would you please reach in,

06:09.670 --> 06:11.030
take out another one for me if
you would.

06:11.030 --> 06:12.830
And you've got another one, face
up. Very nice.

06:12.830 --> 06:14.200
The three of clubs.
I love it.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.130
So now, gentlemen, you can put
the card back in.

06:16.130 --> 06:17.470
You remember it.
You showed it to the camera.

06:17.470 --> 06:18.830
You can put it back in any way
you like.

06:18.830 --> 06:20.530
Face up or face down.
It's completely up to you.

06:20.530 --> 06:22.030
Yeah, slide it in there.
Absolutely.

06:22.030 --> 06:24.100
So you see it going in, and
which way, do you want to put it

06:24.100 --> 06:25.800
back in face up?
- I'm going face down.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.570
- Great.
Slide it right in there for me.

06:27.570 --> 06:29.170
We'll even leave it sticking out
so you see it there, but to the

06:29.170 --> 06:32.170
very last moment.
Now look.

06:32.170 --> 06:34.200
At this point, some cards are
face up, some cards are face

06:34.200 --> 06:35.530
down.
- No.

06:35.530 --> 06:37.100
- Look, I'm not even going to
touch them. I'm just going to

06:37.100 --> 06:38.470
let them sit there.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:38.470 --> 06:41.030
And if I let them sit there,
they start to move all on their

06:41.030 --> 06:42.800
own.
They start to turn over, so now

06:42.800 --> 06:47.270
every card is facing the right
way.

06:47.270 --> 06:51.670
Every card is now face-up.
Except for one.

06:51.670 --> 06:54.130
Except for two.
The only two.

06:54.130 --> 06:59.230
And hopefully, lucky for me,
they are your two cards.

06:59.230 --> 07:06.470
[applause]
- Thank you.

07:06.470 --> 07:09.330
- Thank you.
- Kostya Kimlet, ladies and

07:09.330 --> 07:11.600
gentlemen.
Gentlemen, you can take your

07:11.600 --> 07:12.970
seats.
Are you taking the cards with

07:12.970 --> 07:14.830
you?
Is that okay?

07:14.830 --> 07:19.630
- It is absolutely fine.
- Of course it's okay.

07:19.630 --> 07:22.030
- Take a few of them.
I think we've got a rough idea

07:22.030 --> 07:24.730
how this might be heading, but
come and join me round the fun

07:24.730 --> 07:26.600
here.
Let the guys sit down.

07:26.600 --> 07:29.370
Ladies and gentlemen, how
spectacular was that.

07:29.370 --> 07:34.300
[applause]
Wow. Wow.

07:34.300 --> 07:37.700
And you know, uh, who doesn't
love to see Penn pissed off

07:37.700 --> 07:39.570
like that?
I mean, that's a...

07:39.570 --> 07:42.400
He's in a terrible mood now but
that was really quite special

07:42.400 --> 07:44.070
indeed.
Um, this trick.

07:44.070 --> 07:45.400
Is this one that you've
come up with?

07:45.400 --> 07:46.730
- Yes, it is.
- Okay.

07:46.730 --> 07:48.170
- Absolutely, yeah, you know,
some magicians, we create the

07:48.170 --> 07:49.570
magic.
That's what we love to do.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.130
Absolutely.
- So really, the chance of them

07:51.130 --> 07:54.100
getting this, certainly, if they
do it'll be having seen it for

07:54.100 --> 07:57.070
this first time not knowing some
of the tricks in the past.

07:57.070 --> 07:59.270
- Absolutely right.
- Now, I'm hoping that you will

07:59.270 --> 08:01.270
be back here on stage performing
with them.

08:01.270 --> 08:02.700
Would that mean a lot to you?
You're a fan of these guys?

08:02.700 --> 08:04.670
- Oh, absolutely, I've been a
fan for such a long time and

08:04.670 --> 08:06.470
it's a pleasure.
I mean, to be back here in Vegas

08:06.470 --> 08:08.570
on the stage would be wonderful.
- I think we're ready to hear

08:08.570 --> 08:10.630
your verdict.
Mr. Penn and Mr. Teller?

08:10.630 --> 08:12.930
What do you have to say?
- Okay.

08:12.930 --> 08:16.870
I want to say right up front, I
hate you.

08:16.870 --> 08:21.030
Let's get that out of the way.
There is a bias here.

08:21.030 --> 08:25.230
I hated the way you looked, I
hated the way you cleanly

08:25.230 --> 08:28.970
handled the deck of cards, I
hated that I knew the punch line

08:28.970 --> 08:31.800
when you started, I hated that
it was clean all the way

08:31.800 --> 08:34.970
through, I hated that I should
have known it.

08:34.970 --> 08:37.100
I hated it from the moment
you walked out.

08:37.100 --> 08:40.169
I tell you, when I saw him
sitting there with his beady

08:40.169 --> 08:45.730
little eyes, I wanted you as
dead as a hammer.

08:45.730 --> 08:47.130
- I feel the love. Thank you.
- Right there.

08:47.130 --> 08:51.930
No, you don't feel any love.
You feel nothing but hate.

08:51.930 --> 08:55.230
I knew you were going to fool me
from the moment I saw you

08:55.230 --> 08:58.770
sitting there and yes you did,
but who cares?

08:58.770 --> 09:00.970
[applause]
And you big dumb dumb.

09:00.970 --> 09:03.930
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

09:03.930 --> 09:08.500
No it's not. No it's not.
No it's not. No it's not.

09:08.500 --> 09:12.900
No it's not. Stop it. Stop.
Shut up. Shut up.

09:12.900 --> 09:17.170
Bring that back into the air.
Bring that back up.

09:17.170 --> 09:20.370
- Put it back. Put it back.
- You fooled me.

09:20.370 --> 09:24.200
You know for a fact that it's
hard to say the word "big"

09:24.200 --> 09:30.130
without covering it with "dumb."
You fooled the big dumb guy.

09:30.130 --> 09:34.770
That doesn't mean jack.
Two-thirds of the people on here

09:34.770 --> 09:39.200
fool the big dumb guy.
When you bring that thing down,

09:39.200 --> 09:42.600
when you say "fooler fooler
fooler," is when you fool

09:42.600 --> 09:46.830
Teller, and Teller handled the
cards, and he looked at it, and

09:46.830 --> 09:50.370
he thought about it.
And you fooled him.

09:50.370 --> 09:53.330
You fooled Teller.
Now bring it down.

09:53.330 --> 09:56.230
Now it's official.
- Wow. Wow.

09:56.230 --> 09:58.870
- [bleep]
Go to hell, [indistinct].

09:58.870 --> 10:01.130
Hope you choke on it.
I don't like him, I don't like

- Thank you.

10:04.730 --> 10:08.000
- Thank you very much.
You're fabulous.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.470
He did it.
He fooled Penn and Teller.

10:13.470 --> 10:17.800
Nice job. Great job.
Well done.

10:17.800 --> 10:20.100
We'll be right back with more

</i> Now, one act has already

10:36.370 --> 10:39.000
stumped Penn and Teller and
earned the priceless opportunity

10:39.000 --> 10:42.100
to perform alongside them in

Do I hear two?
Let's meet our

10:43.570 --> 10:49.530
next potential fooler.
- Hello, I'm Frederick Falk and

10:49.530 --> 10:52.370
I'm a close-up magician.
The lifestyle of any performing

10:52.370 --> 10:55.100
artist is hard when they're
first starting out.

10:55.100 --> 10:56.870
I think having the life
experience of having been in

10:56.870 --> 11:00.370
the military really helped me a
lot to prepare for that.

11:00.370 --> 11:02.430
Everything goes into creating
the character.

11:02.430 --> 11:04.370
When I put on the wardrobe,
when I get ready for a show,

11:04.370 --> 11:08.530
I go from being just another
tall, blond, young guy to this

11:08.530 --> 11:10.900
character.
There are a lot of correlations

11:10.900 --> 11:13.530
between the character that I've
created and why so much of the

11:13.530 --> 11:16.470
magic that I create has to do
with time.

11:16.470 --> 11:20.470
That's what interests me.

11:20.470 --> 11:22.830
- Please welcome Frederick
Falk.

11:22.830 --> 11:28.570
[applause]
- Now, before I begin, I will

11:28.570 --> 11:30.170
need the assistance of one
volunteer.

11:30.170 --> 11:32.300
Jonathan, I wonder if
you might assist me with this.

11:32.300 --> 11:33.630
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

11:33.630 --> 11:36.330
- Well, you know what, I had--I
was going to maybe get someone

11:36.330 --> 11:37.670
else to do this for you.
Is that okay?

11:37.670 --> 11:39.300
- That's perfect, certainly.
- I'll tell you why, because a

11:39.300 --> 11:40.700
friend of mine is over from
England, and I thought it would

11:40.700 --> 11:42.100
be fun to have someone else on
stage anyway.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.500
We haven't met.
 You didn't know I was going

11:43.500 --> 11:44.870
to do this.
But you will know him, ladies

11:44.870 --> 11:46.500
and gentlemen.
He's one of the stars of <i>Star</i>

11:46.500 --> 11:49.200
<i>Trek, </i> the <i>Mission: Impossible
</i> films with Cruise, his own film

11:49.200 --> 11:51.230
<i>Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz,
</i> so many more.

11:51.230 --> 11:54.800
Mr. Simon Pegg is right here.
- Oh, my God.

11:54.800 --> 11:58.270
- Come on up, Simon.
Welcome to Vegas, baby.

11:58.270 --> 12:03.270
[applause]
I'll leave you guys to it.

12:03.270 --> 12:07.370
- Hello.
Well, thank you, Simon.

12:07.370 --> 12:10.700
This is a treat.
This is amazing.

12:10.700 --> 12:13.570
I'll try to not let this
distract me too much.

12:13.570 --> 12:19.670
Simon, since I was a little kid,
I've always been fascinated with

12:19.670 --> 12:25.070
the idea of time and how we as
humans--how we perceive and

12:25.070 --> 12:27.770
quantify it.
How we measure it with clocks

12:27.770 --> 12:29.930
and calendars.
Not only that but

12:29.930 --> 12:32.330
how it affects us.
So I devised this little

12:32.330 --> 12:36.130
experiment to measure just that.
Now, Simon, your job is very

12:36.130 --> 12:40.170
easy, and really, the time on
this watch is completely

12:40.170 --> 12:42.770
irrelevant as you will see in
just a few moments.

12:42.770 --> 12:45.800
So Simon, all I would like you
to do is extend your index and

12:45.800 --> 12:47.830
thumb.
I'm going to turn the watch face

12:47.830 --> 12:49.370
down.
The reason I'm doing this is

12:49.370 --> 12:51.770
obviously so I cannot see what
you're doing, and I want this

12:51.770 --> 12:54.530
to be random for you.
Simon, just spin the stem on

12:54.530 --> 12:58.800
that watch until you are
satisfied, and when you are we

12:58.800 --> 13:01.200
will proceed.
- Okay.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.000
- Okay, now push in the stem.
That's very important.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.630
Make sure you feel it click.
You felt it click?

13:04.630 --> 13:06.770
- It went in.
- This watch is now set.

13:06.770 --> 13:08.800
I cannot further adjust this
watch, okay?

13:08.800 --> 13:11.330
Nobody can.
Now I'm going to show you--I'm

13:11.330 --> 13:14.070
going to show the camera the
time that you stopped at.

13:14.070 --> 13:16.170
Now I realize there's two
Jumbotrons on either side of me

13:16.170 --> 13:18.770
so while I do this, I'm going to
face the back wall, all right?

13:18.770 --> 13:21.930
Remember this time, okay?
I'll do my best not to see.

13:21.930 --> 13:23.270
You got it?
- Yes.

13:23.270 --> 13:24.700
- Okay.
Now if you would please put both

13:24.700 --> 13:28.330
of your hands out in front of
you like this, but palms facing

13:28.330 --> 13:31.200
each other like a sandwich,
okay?

13:31.200 --> 13:33.270
Vertic--yep, there we go.
Lift it up.

13:33.270 --> 13:36.270
I'm just going to sandwich that
right in there.

13:36.270 --> 13:38.130
Now, you can put
them down on the table.

13:38.130 --> 13:41.030
Whatever happens, do not move
from that spot.

13:41.030 --> 13:43.470
We'll get back to you.
Here's where the envelope comes

13:43.470 --> 13:46.900
in.
I have one piece of paper.

13:46.900 --> 13:51.370
And all this has on it is a
blank clock face, all right?

13:51.370 --> 13:54.930
Simon, what I would like you to
do, is out there in space, just

13:54.930 --> 13:59.270
imagine this clock, this blank
clock but about 40 feet bigger.

13:59.270 --> 14:00.600
Okay?
- Okay.

14:00.600 --> 14:03.870
- And just project the hands--
the time on the watch that you

14:03.870 --> 14:07.530
stopped at, project the hands
onto that clock, all right?

14:07.530 --> 14:10.670
And I'm writing this down in
Sharpie--permanent marker, so

14:10.670 --> 14:13.300
I can't change my mind later.
I'm committed to this.

14:13.300 --> 14:15.670
Whatever happens.
You know what?

14:15.670 --> 14:17.900
I got ahead of myself.
I have a little insurance

14:17.900 --> 14:20.830
policy.
If this doesn't work for

14:20.830 --> 14:23.830
whatever reason, sometimes magic
goes that way, you get to keep

14:23.830 --> 14:27.130
whatever's in here.
Just as a little consolation

14:27.130 --> 14:28.700
prize.
I'm all about customer

14:28.700 --> 14:32.500
satisfaction.
All right, go.

14:32.500 --> 14:36.800
- Kay.
[exhales]

14:41.170 --> 14:44.800
- Okay.
Let's see what we got.

14:44.800 --> 14:49.070
Now, before I go any farther,
Simon, for the very first time

14:49.070 --> 14:52.600
out loud, what was the time that
you stopped at that you saw on

14:52.600 --> 14:56.530
the watch for everybody?
- Uh, I think--I forgot.

14:56.530 --> 14:59.070
No, I think it was ten to five?
- Ten to five as I said.

14:59.070 --> 15:01.500
please remember, otherwise this
will be a spectacular waste of

15:01.500 --> 15:06.030
time.
So, thank you for remembering.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.370
Thank you for remembering that.
It said ten minutes to five.

15:08.370 --> 15:11.430
So 4:50?
- Yeah.

15:11.430 --> 15:15.800
- Magic is a beautiful thing
when it works, but every now and

15:15.800 --> 15:18.230
again things don't go quite the
way you wanted them to.

15:18.230 --> 15:20.770
Thankfully that is not tonight.
Simon, that is exactly what I

15:20.770 --> 15:23.030
got.
4:50.

15:23.030 --> 15:30.470
[applause]
Thank you.

15:30.470 --> 15:33.100
Now, Simon, it's interesting
that you stopped at that

15:33.100 --> 15:36.130
particular moment and here's
why, and this is where I'm

15:36.130 --> 15:38.100
getting back full circle with
the way we perceive and

15:38.100 --> 15:42.330
experience time.
Simon, time really--it's all in

15:42.330 --> 15:45.630
our heads, really, and the
reason I know that is because

15:45.630 --> 15:48.730
there are no hands on that
watch whatsoever.

15:48.730 --> 15:50.330
Look at it.
Take a look.

15:50.330 --> 15:54.730
[laughs]
[applause]

15:54.730 --> 16:02.830
Thank you.
Whew, thankfully it worked, so I

16:02.830 --> 16:05.430
get to keep my consolation
prize, but just for fun, this is

16:05.430 --> 16:08.500
what you would have gotten.
These are old Morgan silver

16:08.500 --> 16:09.830
dollars.
These are a dollar apiece.

16:09.830 --> 16:13.670
I have one,
two,

16:13.670 --> 16:17.100
three,
four

16:17.100 --> 16:19.770
silver dollars.
And this is a Walking Liberty

16:19.770 --> 16:22.300
50 cent piece.
This is 50 cents.

16:22.300 --> 16:28.830
$4.50 and you stopped at 4:50.
[applause]

16:28.830 --> 16:34.700
Thank you.
- Thank you to Mr. Simon Pegg.

16:34.700 --> 16:37.370
You can go back to your seat.
Good job, Simon.

16:37.370 --> 16:39.000
Frederick Falk, ladies and
gentlemen.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.330
That was incredible.
Fabulous work.

16:41.330 --> 16:43.200
I love the way you're dressed.
It's kind of Victorian--

16:43.200 --> 16:44.830
Edwardian gentleman?
- Very--somewhere in the

16:44.830 --> 16:47.170
middle, early 1900s.
- How long have you been

16:47.170 --> 16:48.600
doing this sort of routine with
that sort of routine?

16:48.600 --> 16:52.100
- When I left the military and
I moved to Los Angeles and

16:52.100 --> 16:54.600
became a full-time member of the
Hollywood Magic Castle, I knew I

16:54.600 --> 16:56.670
had to create some kind of
character.

16:56.670 --> 16:59.470
- If you do for them, what
would it mean--I guess you're

16:59.470 --> 17:01.170
already fairly well established
if you're over there at the

17:01.170 --> 17:02.730
Magic Castle.
- There are a lot of people

17:02.730 --> 17:06.030
when I was coming--when I was
growing up and then the military

17:06.030 --> 17:08.630
and then they said, you want to
go--move to where and become a

17:08.630 --> 17:10.829
member of what?
- So this will be a good

17:10.829 --> 17:12.569
revenge on those--
- Not that I'm--I'm not a

17:12.569 --> 17:14.970
spiteful person but in a way it
would be very internally satis--

17:14.970 --> 17:16.400
- You want to enjoy, if you
want to turn to that camera and

17:16.400 --> 17:18.599
just say [bleep] you to all of
them...

17:18.599 --> 17:19.970
[laughter]
- No, I won't do it.

17:19.970 --> 17:22.430
I'll be a good person.
- Oh, thanks.

17:22.430 --> 17:25.329
That makes me a bad one.
Well, thank you.

17:25.329 --> 17:27.300
Okay, Penn, would you like to
give us your verdict?

17:27.300 --> 17:30.230
- Yes.
What really amazed us was that

17:30.230 --> 17:33.270
you actually had Simon Pegg
on stage.

17:33.270 --> 17:38.170
Which was pretty--pretty great.
[applause]

17:38.170 --> 17:41.700
We, uh, since <i>Shaun of the Dead
</i> we have just been out of our

17:41.700 --> 17:44.270
minds for Simon Pegg.
He's just fabulous.

17:44.270 --> 17:47.530
Simon's wearing a digital watch,
but I would say if we were able

17:47.530 --> 17:52.830
to find the one person in the
United States of America that's

17:52.830 --> 17:57.270
still wearing a regular analog
watch, I don't think you would

17:57.270 --> 18:01.430
have been able to do that trick.
- Yes, yes, and no. I--

18:01.430 --> 18:03.970
- It's the no we're interested
in.

18:03.970 --> 18:07.830
- Well, it's--
- There's a style of watch that

18:07.830 --> 18:12.500
the bezel can be turned and you
can set it up beforehand like

18:12.500 --> 18:14.170
that.
You can pull it out without

18:14.170 --> 18:17.070
change at the time, and you can
push it back in.

18:17.070 --> 18:20.200
That's what we're saying.
- That--

18:20.200 --> 18:23.930
- I mean, I don't want to say
this, but it is a gimmicked

18:23.930 --> 18:28.830
watch.
- I--that's--and I really, I'm

18:28.830 --> 18:32.500
truly not trying to be
argumentative and push this--

18:32.500 --> 18:34.000
- Well, you're doing a pretty
bad job.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.370
[laughter]
- No, I mean truly--I mean,

18:35.370 --> 18:36.900
yes, yes--
- But it's within your right to

18:36.900 --> 18:39.030
do this.
- Yes, the hands--

18:39.030 --> 18:41.730
obviously the hands vanish.
So I be--I mean, you could--you

18:41.730 --> 18:44.600
could certainly could inspect
the watch but I--

18:44.600 --> 18:46.300
- I mean, we're going to have
to go to Johnny Thompson, I

18:46.300 --> 18:47.700
believe.
- Well, here's the thing.

18:47.700 --> 18:49.230
Number one, you know, he's a
Marine.

18:49.230 --> 18:53.170
He's going to put up a fight.
[laughter]

18:53.170 --> 18:55.670
- Really, I--I'm not--I'm not
trying to be belligerent.

18:55.670 --> 18:57.000
- I know you're not.
You're not at all.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.830
Let's go upstairs, 'cause the
final decision can't rest with

18:58.830 --> 19:01.500
me, and when there's a little
bit of a kind of a gray area,

19:01.500 --> 19:03.870
shall we say, we have a man in
the house who's backstage

19:03.870 --> 19:06.000
called Johnny Thompson.
One of the greats from the

19:06.000 --> 19:08.300
world of magic.
He knows everything about this,

19:08.300 --> 19:11.200
so I'm going to ask for them to
give me their decision.

19:11.200 --> 19:16.000
The verdict is...
You did...

19:16.000 --> 19:18.800
not fool them.
- Oh.

19:18.800 --> 19:21.070
- I'm afraid.
But you fooled the rest of us

19:21.070 --> 19:23.700
and that's kind of what counts
in one way.

19:23.700 --> 19:27.170
It was a great performance.
Mr. Frederick Falk.

19:27.170 --> 19:29.130
Ask for him by name.
Thanks Freddy, take care man.

19:29.130 --> 19:32.870
Good luck.
We'll be back in a moment with

19:32.870 --> 19:35.730
more incredible tricks,
including one by our very own

19:35.730 --> 19:37.270
Penn and Teller.
We'll be right back.

20:25.530 --> 20:29.300
Jackson lean and I tore my
Achilles tendon and the doctors

20:29.300 --> 20:32.930
actually said that I shouldn't
be walking today.

20:32.930 --> 20:36.170
That moment terrified me.
I had the mindset that I'm

20:36.170 --> 20:38.470
walking.
I'm going to suck it up and I'm

20:38.470 --> 20:40.730
going to figure it out and I've
been walking for about three,

20:40.730 --> 20:42.600
four weeks now.
Just in time to make it on the

20:42.600 --> 20:45.670
show.

20:45.670 --> 20:54.070
- Please welcome Chris Funk.

20:54.070 --> 20:56.300
Well, it's card trick time,
'cause what's a magic show

20:56.300 --> 20:58.970
without an abundance of card
tricks?

20:58.970 --> 21:02.700
Besides unique and original.
Let's get crazy and have a bunch

21:02.700 --> 21:05.700

cards here.

21:05.700 --> 21:07.830
Looks like you three can hardly
wait.

I'm going to have the three of

21:10.000 --> 21:11.400

here.

What's your name?

21:22.330 --> 21:24.300
- Tina.
- Tina.

21:24.300 --> 21:25.630
- Lexi.
- Lexi.

21:25.630 --> 21:27.430
All right, I'm going to have you
select some playing cards.

21:27.430 --> 21:29.230
We're going to do this in the
fairest way possible.

21:29.230 --> 21:31.030
Shawn, I'm going to have you cut
about half of the cards if you

21:31.030 --> 21:33.170
will, please.
Beautiful.

21:33.170 --> 21:34.970
And I want you to turn them
face-up like that with a good

21:34.970 --> 21:36.530
little flair of the wrist if you
don't mind.

21:36.530 --> 21:38.700
Fantastic.
And put them down, face up right

21:38.700 --> 21:40.300
on top of this pack here.
- Face up?

21:40.300 --> 21:42.600
- Yes. Excellent.
What we've done

21:42.600 --> 21:44.800
is we've marked a spot.
We marked a spot with some

21:44.800 --> 21:48.200
face-up cards meeting some
face-down cards.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.400
I'm going to have you take that
first face-down card.

21:50.400 --> 21:51.870
I want you to memorize it.
You're going to take the next

21:51.870 --> 21:54.630
card, memorize it, you're going
to take the last card,

21:54.630 --> 21:56.870
memorize it.
Go ahead, memorize the cards.

21:56.870 --> 21:58.400
There's a little camera lurking
behind you.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.130
What I'm going to have you do is
show that camera.

22:00.130 --> 22:01.930
I'm going to to turn my back.
I don't want to see a thing.

22:01.930 --> 22:07.730
Ready? Do it.
[soft piano music plays]

22:07.730 --> 22:09.870

Are you still there?

22:09.870 --> 22:11.500
- We're here.
- Okay, good.

22:11.500 --> 22:13.330
I want you to place the cards
back anywhere in the deck that

22:13.330 --> 22:18.700

Go ahead, Tina.

22:18.700 --> 22:21.000
Lisa, go ahead.
Very good.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.570
Shawn, I'm going to get you to
give them a quick little mix up

22:22.570 --> 22:26.270
just like this if you don't
mind.

22:26.270 --> 22:28.530
Beautiful.
Round of applause.

22:28.530 --> 22:33.800
You can take your seats.

22:33.800 --> 22:36.000
Didn't always know I was going
to be a magician.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.870
No, I thought I was going to be
a musician.

22:38.870 --> 22:41.070
Let me re-phrase that.
I was told I was going to be a

22:41.070 --> 22:42.800
musician.
Anyone feeling my pain?

22:42.800 --> 22:45.430
Anyone?
Couple of you? Yeah.

22:45.430 --> 22:47.700
Parents broke the news to me at
the age of six when they told me

22:47.700 --> 22:51.430
I would be taking music lessons
on the violin.

22:51.430 --> 22:55.130
[laughter]
Anyways, I'd always wondered

22:55.130 --> 22:57.930
what it would have been like if
I'd combined my love of music

22:57.930 --> 23:01.430
with my love of magic.
Well, now's the time, and this

23:01.430 --> 23:05.500
is the place.
I learned that music was

23:05.500 --> 23:09.130
powerful.

23:09.130 --> 23:16.330

Starting with you, sir, I'd like

23:23.270 --> 23:26.170
you to name the card that you
selected out loud for everyone

23:26.170 --> 23:28.430
to hear.
- Four of spades.

23:28.430 --> 23:32.030
- Four of spades. All right.
That's a small number, a little

23:32.030 --> 23:34.800
number, a fun number.

- Uh, Scott Joplin.

Let's do something with Bach.

24:23.800 --> 24:28.070
Um, Teller, what I need you to
do is name a song by Bach.

24:28.070 --> 24:29.530
Branden D major?
I couldn't have picked a better

24:29.530 --> 24:31.970
one myself.
Good choice, my friend.

without talking about your

What inspires you?

- Uh, I try to look for my
inspiration in the most unusual

places possible, so it could be
the way I see someone dressed

27:16.600 --> 27:20.270
one day might spark an idea in
my head, or a song that I listen

27:20.270 --> 27:22.500
to on repeat just might make me
think differently about a

27:22.500 --> 27:25.070
concept, um, that's where this
violin routine actually came

27:25.070 --> 27:26.800
from.
I was listening to a piece and

27:26.800 --> 27:30.300
I just felt inspired on the
road, and all of a sudden this

27:30.300 --> 27:32.370
popped into my head, I got home,
I quickly tried it out, it

27:32.370 --> 27:34.900
worked, and I was fired up.
- Well, I love the ending when

27:34.900 --> 27:36.330
you were balancing the violin
as well.

27:36.330 --> 27:39.900
That alone I think was worthy of
a round of applause, but

27:39.900 --> 27:42.430
certainly the whole effect was
fantastic.

Penn.
- You know, I started out,

27:49.170 --> 27:54.600
Chris, as a juggler and there
was a time we went on Broadway

27:54.600 --> 27:56.430
and my father came to see the
show.

27:56.430 --> 27:57.900
And there's no juggling in the
show.

27:57.900 --> 28:00.700
And my father said, "You know,
uh, it's nice to do all that

28:00.700 --> 28:03.170
magic stuff, but you should
have one place in the show where

28:03.170 --> 28:06.770
you juggle so the audience knows
you know how to do something."

28:06.770 --> 28:11.030

Um, it is so wonderful that you

28:11.030 --> 28:12.770
can really play the violin.

- It's great to see someone who
can really do something.

28:15.770 --> 28:19.030
Uh, you know all this.
What a nice routine.

28:19.030 --> 28:22.770
Uh, we know about rising cards--
- Yes.

28:22.770 --> 28:26.270
- It's nice to see a vanishing
birdcage being used to vanish

28:26.270 --> 28:29.430

And in all your classical music

28:29.430 --> 28:32.870
studies, you know, you mentioned
Mozart, you mention Bach, but

28:32.870 --> 28:36.800
you didn't mention our favorite,
you know, who is Balducci.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.630
Does that ring any bells with
you?

28:39.630 --> 28:41.130
- One or two.
- Okay.

28:41.130 --> 28:43.900
- Or perhaps three.
- One, two, or three, yeah.

28:43.900 --> 28:46.800
So I think we have a pretty good
idea how you did it.

28:46.800 --> 28:50.030
Beautifully done.
Okay?

- So, for the rest of our sakes
who really don't kind of

28:52.670 --> 28:56.100
understand what's going on here,
Balducci was enough of a

28:56.100 --> 28:59.370
reference and the other things
he said to make you accept that

28:59.370 --> 29:01.400
you didn't fool them?
- I didn't fool them.

I consider myself both a
magician and an actor.

go to that dark place.

decided to use it with confetti
instead of sand.

35:32.030 --> 35:36.870
that's used in magic that I just
love is when you need to get rid

35:36.870 --> 35:42.030
of some evidence, to get rid of
that evidence in a mistake.

35:42.030 --> 35:44.870
Uh, and that's a wonderful use
of that.

35:44.870 --> 35:47.200
It makes it really really pretty
and makes it so you are

35:47.200 --> 35:51.430
completely clean at the end
whereas you wouldn't be without

35:51.430 --> 35:54.670
that mistake.
Now normally, when magicians do

35:54.670 --> 35:58.130
a mistake like that, it is
pretty clear they're doing that

35:58.130 --> 36:01.430
but you had so much comedy with
it, it was tied so much with the

36:01.430 --> 36:06.100
magic wand, and so beautifully
done that that would have blown

36:06.100 --> 36:10.030
by anybody unless you were a
little smarter than the average

36:10.030 --> 36:13.400
bear.
Um, but it was a wonderful,

36:13.400 --> 36:15.630
wonderful act.
I don't want to go into it too

36:15.630 --> 36:18.700
much more, if you feel that's
enough, because I don't want to

36:18.700 --> 36:22.030
bust it, because this is an act
that could become a classic and

36:22.030 --> 36:25.600
you should be doing it the res--
- I tip my hat to both of you.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.030
[laughter]
- Uh, Nate, that was just a

36:28.030 --> 36:29.400
beautiful thing to watch.
I enjoyed it.

36:29.400 --> 36:31.930
Wasn't it gorgeous,
ladies and gentlemen?

36:31.930 --> 36:34.400
It was a wonderful piece of
entertainment.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.930
Thank you, Nate Dendy.
Thank you so much, sir.

36:36.930 --> 36:42.100
[applause]
We need to take a quick break,

36:42.100 --> 36:44.030
but don't be fooled.
We'll be right back with more

36:44.030 --> 36:47.600
magic, including a dazzling
trick from Penn and Teller.

36:47.600 --> 36:49.470
Don't go away.

Here's a trick from the most

magical pairing since chocolate

37:06.270 --> 37:12.670
Of course it's Penn and Teller.
[applause]

37:12.670 --> 37:15.670
- After doing <i>Fool Us </i> for
awhile, I get asked now and

37:15.670 --> 37:19.730
again what trick that I've seen
fooled me the worst.

37:19.730 --> 37:22.200
People want to know the baddest
trick I've ever seen.

37:22.200 --> 37:24.670
And the trick that fooled me the
worst--the trick was done

37:24.670 --> 37:27.930
for me by Teller.
And Teller's agreed to do it

37:27.930 --> 37:30.630
again for me tonight but he
won't do it for me, 'cause I've

37:30.630 --> 37:32.230
already seen it.
I want to do it for somebody

37:32.230 --> 37:33.700
else.
I want somebody to play the

37:33.700 --> 37:37.400
part of me.
Someone to be Penn Jillette up

37:37.400 --> 37:39.700
here on stage.
How about you, sir.

37:39.700 --> 37:41.370
What's your name, please sir?
- Charlie.

37:41.370 --> 37:42.770
- Charlie.
Okay, I'm going to call you

37:42.770 --> 37:44.100
Penn.
It doesn't matter.

37:44.100 --> 37:45.430
Up here, Charlie.
I picked a good choice.

37:45.430 --> 37:47.470
Look just like me, Charlie.
Right up here, Charlie.

37:47.470 --> 37:49.330
That's uh, that's Penn there.
And you'll stand over there

37:49.330 --> 37:52.000
right next to Teller.
And just face off stage, right

37:52.000 --> 37:54.270
there, would you please--
right there, face off stage.

37:54.270 --> 37:56.470
Let's you get you being a little
more Penn-like.

37:56.470 --> 38:01.570
We'll give you some glasses and
we'll give you a ponytail right

38:01.570 --> 38:06.670
there, and there you are.
Perfect match, isn't it?

38:06.670 --> 38:08.400
I'm not going to leave you
hanging here, Charlie.

38:08.400 --> 38:09.830
We're going to give you a
headset.

38:09.830 --> 38:12.070
Put that headset on.
I'll be able to talk to you,

38:12.070 --> 38:15.000
use the microphone over here.
Tell you what to say and do.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.530
Is that microphone on?
Give it a try.

38:16.530 --> 38:18.430
- Hello?
- Yeah, that seems okay.

38:18.430 --> 38:20.130
I'll talk to you right over
here.

38:20.130 --> 38:22.530
Okay, can you hear me?
- I can hear you.

38:22.530 --> 38:25.530
- Good, say, "Good evening.
My name is Penn Jillette."

38:25.530 --> 38:27.100
- Good evening, my name is Penn
Jillette.

38:27.100 --> 38:28.430
- I talk louder than that.
Lean into it.

38:28.430 --> 38:30.430
Move your arms a lot
when you say it. Re-do my name.

38:30.430 --> 38:32.200
- Good evening, my name is Penn
Jillette.

38:32.200 --> 38:34.500
- Beautiful.
Now turn to Teller.

38:34.500 --> 38:37.270
And this is my partner, Teller.
- And this is my partner,

38:37.270 --> 38:39.100
Teller.
- We're Penn and Teller.

38:39.100 --> 38:42.930
- We are Penn and Teller.
- Now flash a peace sign.

38:42.930 --> 38:45.670
- There you go.
[laughter]

38:45.670 --> 38:48.770
Ladies and gentlemen, and now
the trick that Teller uses that

38:48.770 --> 38:54.400
always fools Penn, ladies and
gentlemen, Penn and Teller.

38:54.400 --> 38:57.730
[applause]
- Say, "Teller pulled out a

38:57.730 --> 39:00.830
perfectly ordinary deck of
cards ."

39:00.830 --> 39:03.170
- Teller pulled out an
ordinary deck of cards.

39:03.170 --> 39:05.670
- He fanned them out.
I took one at random.

39:05.670 --> 39:09.430
- He fanned them out, and I'm
going to take one at random.

39:09.430 --> 39:12.330
- I looked at it and memorized
it.

39:12.330 --> 39:17.530
- I looked at it and memorized
it.

39:17.530 --> 39:22.830
- It was the Queen of Hearts.
- It was the Queen of Hearts.

39:22.830 --> 39:25.800
- But there's no way Teller
could have known that.

39:25.800 --> 39:30.670
- But there's no way Teller
could have known that.

39:30.670 --> 39:32.500
- I put the card back in the
deck.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.400
- I put the card back in the
deck.

39:34.400 --> 39:36.600
- And Teller shuffled them up
real good.

39:36.600 --> 39:39.870
- And Teller shuffled them up
really good.

39:39.870 --> 39:44.270
- Teller then bragged he would
pull my card out of thin air.

39:44.270 --> 39:47.930
- Teller then bragged he would
pull it out of thin air.

39:47.930 --> 39:50.800
- Teller walked over and got
into that thing with the fans

39:50.800 --> 39:53.330
underneath it.
- Teller walked over to that

39:53.330 --> 39:56.930
thing with the fans in it.
- He put the cards on the

39:56.930 --> 39:58.400
floor.
- He put the cards on the

39:58.400 --> 40:00.830
floor.
- He turned on the fans.

40:00.830 --> 40:03.870
- He turned on the fans.
- The air was filled with

40:03.870 --> 40:05.430
cards.
- The air was filled with

40:05.430 --> 40:07.600
cards.
- How would he find my Queen

40:07.600 --> 40:11.430
of Hearts in pitch darkness?
- How would he find my Queen of

40:11.430 --> 40:13.670
Hearts in pitch darkness?
- Then suddenly, the Queen of

40:13.670 --> 40:16.770
Hearts!
- And suddenly, the Queen of

40:16.770 --> 40:19.770
Hearts.

Teller.

Teller.

40:25.270 --> 40:27.100

40:27.100 --> 40:30.300

40:30.300 --> 40:32.930
Beautifully done.
Beautifully done, Charlie.

40:32.930 --> 40:35.070
It was like
looking into a mirror.

40:35.070 --> 40:37.530
You were just wonderful there,
Charlie.

40:37.530 --> 40:40.430
Thank you so much, that's
Charlie playing the part of me.

40:40.430 --> 40:42.170
It was like looking in the
mirror, Teller.

40:42.170 --> 40:43.870
It was like
looking in the mirror.

40:43.870 --> 40:48.330
Perfectly done.
Perfectly done.

40:48.330 --> 40:51.770
- For Penn and Teller and all
of us here at <i>Fool Us, </i> we thank

40:51.770 --> 40:54.100
you so much for watching and
hope you have a magical night.

40:54.100 --> 40:57.330
See you soon.
