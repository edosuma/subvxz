I was sitting with my friend
Arthur Kornblum in a restaurant.

02:18.304 --> 02:21.473
It was a Horn & Hardart cafeteria.

02:21.641 --> 02:26.145
And this beautiful girl walked in,
and I turned to Arthur...

02:26.312 --> 02:31.358
and I said "Arthur, you see that girl?
I'm going to marry her."

02:31.526 --> 02:34.111
And two weeks later we were married.

02:34.279 --> 02:37.573
And it's over 50 years later...

02:37.740 --> 02:40.033

It's an 18-hour trip, which becomes
six shifts of three hours.

04:28.309 --> 04:31.853
Or, alternatively,
we could break it down by mileage.

04:32.021 --> 04:35.691
There's a...
There's a map on the visor...

04:35.858 --> 04:39.695

where we can change shifts.

04:39.862 --> 04:41.697

No. I don't like to eat between meals.

I'll roll down the window.

the story of your life?

05:03.886 --> 05:05.137
The story of my life?

05:05.305 --> 05:08.056
We got 18 hours to kill
before New York.

05:08.224 --> 05:12.060
That won't even get us out of Chicago.
Nothing's happened to me yet.

05:12.228 --> 05:14.730
- So I'm going to New York.
- So something'll happen?

05:14.897 --> 05:16.273
- Yes.
- Like what?

05:16.441 --> 05:18.900
Like I'm going to journalism school.

05:19.068 --> 05:22.195
So you can write about things
that happen to other people.

05:23.114 --> 05:26.074
- That's one way to look at it.
- Suppose nothing happens.

05:26.242 --> 05:29.911
Suppose you never meet anybody,
you never become anything...

05:30.079 --> 05:33.498
then you die and
nobody notices for two weeks

05:33.666 --> 05:35.751
until the smell drifts into the hall.

05:38.254 --> 05:41.423
- Amanda said you had a dark side.
- Thaf's whaf drew her fo me.

05:41.591 --> 05:44.885
- Your dark side?
- Sure. Why, don'f you have a dark side?

05:45.053 --> 05:48.680
I know, you probably
dot your "I" s with little hearts.

05:48.848 --> 05:51.475
I have just as much of a dark side
as the next person.

05:51.642 --> 05:55.145
Oh, really? When I buy a new book,
I always read the last page first.

05:55.313 --> 05:58.106
That way, if I die before I finish
I know how it ends.

05:58.274 --> 06:00.609
That, my friend, is a dark side.

06:00.777 --> 06:05.322
That doesn't mean you're deep. I mean,
yes, basically I'm a happy person.

06:05.490 --> 06:08.075
- So am I.
- I don't see anything wrong with that.

06:08.242 --> 06:11.411
No, you're too busy being happy.
Ever think about death?

06:11.579 --> 06:13.747
- Yes.
- Sure you do. A fleeting thought...

06:13.915 --> 06:17.292
that drifts in and out of
the transom of your mind. I spend days.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.461
And this makes you a better person?

06:19.629 --> 06:23.340
Look, when the shit comes down,
I'm gonna be prepared and you're not.

06:23.508 --> 06:27.803
In the meantime, you're gonna
ruin your whole life waiting for it.

06:34.811 --> 06:38.063
- You're wrong.
- I'm nof wrong. He wanfs her fo leave.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.358
- Thaf's why he pufs her on fhe plane.
- She doesn'f wanf fo sfay!

06:41.526 --> 06:42.818
Of course she wanfs fo sfay!

06:42.985 --> 06:45.821

I don'f wanna spend

06:49.033 --> 06:51.034

06:51.202 --> 06:53.662
Thaf probably sounds snobbish
fo you, buf I don'f.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.580
You'd rafher be
in a passionless marriage...

06:55.748 --> 06:57.165
And Firsf Lady of Czechoslovakia.

06:57.333 --> 07:00.335
Than with the man you had
the greatest sex of your life with...

07:00.503 --> 07:03.213
just because he owns a bar
and that is all he does?

07:03.381 --> 07:04.756
Yes.

07:04.924 --> 07:08.343
And so would any woman in
her right mind. Women are practical...

07:08.511 --> 07:11.138
even Ingrid Bergman,
which is why she gets on the plane

07:11.305 --> 07:13.557
at the end of the movie.

07:16.352 --> 07:18.520
I understand.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.189
- What? What?
- Nothing.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.567
- What?
- Forget about it.

07:23.734 --> 07:26.194
- Forget about what?
- It's not important.

07:26.362 --> 07:28.405
No, just tell me.

07:29.031 --> 07:31.867
Obviously you haven't had great sex yet.

07:32.034 --> 07:34.202
- Two, please.
- Right over there.

07:34.370 --> 07:36.413
- Yes, I have.
- No, you haven't.

07:36.581 --> 07:40.375
It just so happens that
I have had plenty of good sex.

07:58.436 --> 08:00.896
With whom?

08:01.063 --> 08:04.733
- What?
- With whom did you have this great sex?

08:04.901 --> 08:06.943
I'm not gonna tell you that!

08:07.111 --> 08:09.571
Fine. Don't tell me.

08:14.452 --> 08:18.246
- Shel Gordon.
- Shel. Sheldon?

08:18.414 --> 08:21.750
No. No, you did not have
great sex with Sheldon.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.586
- I did, too.
- No, you didn't.

08:24.754 --> 08:29.090
A Sheldon can do your taxes. If you
need a root canal, Sheldon's your man.

08:29.258 --> 08:32.427
But humpin' is not Sheldon's
strong suit. It's the name.

08:32.595 --> 08:34.929
"Do it to me, Sheldon."
"You're an animal, Sheldon."

08:35.097 --> 08:37.224
"Ride me, big... Sheldon."

08:37.390 --> 08:40.309
- It doesn't work.
- Hi.

08:40.477 --> 08:42.979
- What can I get you?
- I'll have a number three.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.775
The chef's salad with
the oil and vinegar on the side.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.276
And the apple pie à la mode.

08:48.444 --> 08:51.655
Chef and apple à la mode.

08:51.822 --> 08:55.450
But I'd like the pie heated
and I want the ice cream on the side.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.911
I'd like strawberry, if you have it.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.288
If not, then whipped cream,
but only if it's real.

09:00.456 --> 09:02.165
If it's out of a can, nothing.

09:02.333 --> 09:06.294
- Not even the pie?
- No, just the pie, but then not heated.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.637
- What?
- Nothin'. Nothin'.

09:17.640 --> 09:21.184
- How come you broke up with Sheldon?
- How do you know we broke up?

09:21.352 --> 09:25.814
If you didn't, you wouldn't be with me.
You'd be with Shel the Wonder Schlong.

09:27.066 --> 09:30.110
First of all, I am not with you.

09:30.278 --> 09:33.822
And second of all, it is none
of your business why we broke up.

09:33.990 --> 09:37.534
You're right, you're right.
I don't wanna know.

09:40.121 --> 09:44.708
Well, it was because he was jealous and
I had these days-of-the-week underpants.

09:44.875 --> 09:48.044
Sorry, I need a judge's ruling.

09:48.212 --> 09:50.714
- Days-of-the-week underpants?
- Yes.

09:50.881 --> 09:54.175
They had days of the week on them
and I thought they were funny.

09:54.343 --> 09:57.887
Then one day Sheldon says to me
"You never wear Sunday."

09:58.055 --> 10:01.057
He's all suspicious.
Where had I left Sunday?

10:01.225 --> 10:03.435
And I told him and he didn't believe me.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.730
- What?
- They don't make Sunday.

10:06.897 --> 10:10.358
- Why not?
- Because of God.

10:14.697 --> 10:18.867
OK, so 15%o of my share is... 90.

10:19.535 --> 10:21.870
$6.90.

10:24.915 --> 10:26.958
Let's leave seven.

10:29.670 --> 10:30.670
What?

10:33.215 --> 10:35.383
Do I have something on my face?

10:36.510 --> 10:38.678
You're a very attractive person.

10:40.765 --> 10:41.931
Thank you.

10:42.099 --> 10:44.267
Amanda never said
how attractive you were.

10:44.435 --> 10:46.728
Maybe she doesn't think I'm attractive.

10:46.896 --> 10:51.024
I don't think it's a matter of opinion.
Empirically, you are attractive.

10:53.277 --> 10:55.403
Amanda is my friend.

10:55.571 --> 10:56.946
So?

10:57.114 --> 10:59.908
- So you're going with her.
- So?

11:00.076 --> 11:02.285
So you're coming on to me!

11:02.870 --> 11:05.413
No, I wasn't.

11:05.873 --> 11:07.582
What?

11:08.084 --> 11:11.920
Can't a man say a woman is attractive
without it being a come-on?

11:12.088 --> 11:13.463
All right, all right.

11:13.631 --> 11:18.259
Let's just say, just for the sake
of argument, that it was a come-on.

11:18.427 --> 11:22.430
What d'you want me to do about it?
I take it back, OK? I take it back.

11:22.598 --> 11:23.973
You can't take it back.

11:24.141 --> 11:26.810
- Why not?
- Because it's already out there.

11:26.977 --> 11:30.397
What are we supposed to do?
Call the cops, it's already out there!

11:30.564 --> 11:33.525
Just... let it... lie.

11:33.693 --> 11:38.446
- OK?
- Great! "Let it lie." That's my policy.

11:38.614 --> 11:41.616
That's what I always say: "Let it lie."

11:41.784 --> 11:43.493
Wanna spend the night in a motel?

11:43.661 --> 11:45.662
- See? I didn't let it lie.
- Harry.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.831
I said I would, then I didn't.

11:47.998 --> 11:49.624
- Harry!
- What?

11:49.792 --> 11:52.127
We are just going to be friends, OK?

11:52.294 --> 11:54.963
Great! Friends! It's the best thing.

11:56.382 --> 11:59.134
You realize
fhaf we could never be friends.

11:59.301 --> 12:02.095
- Why not?
- What I'm saying is...

12:02.263 --> 12:05.140
and this is not a come-on
in any way, shape or form...

12:05.307 --> 12:06.933
is that men and women
can't be friends,

12:07.101 --> 12:09.686
'cause the sex part
always gets in the way.

12:11.897 --> 12:12.939
That's not true.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.984
I have a number of men friends
and there is no sex involved.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.235
- You don't.
- I do.

12:17.403 --> 12:18.611
- You don't.
- I do!

12:18.779 --> 12:19.988
You only think you do.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.323
I have sex with them
without my knowledge?

12:22.491 --> 12:25.827
No, they all wanna have sex with you.

12:25.995 --> 12:29.664
- They do not.
- Do, too.

12:29.832 --> 12:30.790
How do you know?

12:30.958 --> 12:34.002
No man can be friends
with a woman he finds attractive.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.129
He always wants to have sex with her.

12:37.006 --> 12:41.134
So you're saying a man can be friends
with a woman he finds unattractive.

12:41.302 --> 12:44.345
No, you pretty much
wanna nail them, too.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.016
What if they don't wanna have sex?

12:48.184 --> 12:53.730
Doesn't matter. The sex thing is already
out there, so the friendship is doomed.

12:54.648 --> 12:56.232
I guess we're not
gonna be friends then.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.400
Guess not.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.402
That's too bad.

But then after ourjunior year
his parents moved away.

14:26.323 --> 14:30.451
- But I never forgot her.
- He never forgot me.

14:30.619 --> 14:33.955
No, her face was burned on my brain.

14:34.123 --> 14:37.667
And it was 34 years later
that I was walking down Broadway...

14:37.835 --> 14:39.961
and I saw her come out
of Toffenetti's.

14:40.129 --> 14:41.963
We both looked at each other...

14:42.131 --> 14:46.467

as she was at sixteen.

- Fine. I'm doin' fine.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.519
I was just walking by
and I thought it was you.

15:38.687 --> 15:40.229
Yeah, it was.

15:40.397 --> 15:44.484
- You still with the DA's office?
- No, I switched to the other side. You?

15:44.652 --> 15:49.072
I work with a small firm. We do
political consulting. Yeah, it's great.

15:50.366 --> 15:53.034
Oh, Harry, this is Sally Albright.
Harry Burns.

15:53.202 --> 15:57.038
Harry and I, we used to...
We lived in the same building.

16:00.584 --> 16:04.712
Well, listen, I got a plane to catch.
It was good to see you, Joe. Bye.

16:11.470 --> 16:15.264
Thank God he couldn't place me. I drove
to New York with him five years ago...

16:15.432 --> 16:18.518
and it was the
longest night of my life.

16:20.020 --> 16:22.897
- What happened?
- He made a pass at me. When I said no:

16:23.065 --> 16:26.192
He was going with
a girlfriend of mine...

16:27.069 --> 16:30.071
Oh, God. I can't remember her name.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.531
Don't get involved with me.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.283
I am 26 and can't remember
the name of the girl...

16:34.451 --> 16:35.743
I was such good friends with

16:35.911 --> 16:37.495
I wouldn't get involved
with her boyfriend.

16:38.288 --> 16:40.373
- So what happened?
- When?

16:40.541 --> 16:43.668
- When he made a pass, you said no...
- Oh, oh.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.421
I said we could just be friends.

16:46.588 --> 16:51.968
And this part I remember. He said men
and women could never really be friends.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.429
Do you think that's true?

16:55.264 --> 16:56.431
No.

16:56.598 --> 16:59.434
Do you have any women friends,
just friends?

17:00.144 --> 17:01.561
No.

17:01.729 --> 17:04.771
But I will get one
if it's important to you.

17:06.650 --> 17:08.651
Amanda Reese!

17:08.819 --> 17:11.112
That was her name. Thank God.

17:11.280 --> 17:14.949
I will miss you. I love you.

17:15.451 --> 17:18.953
- You do?
- Yes.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.290
I love you.

17:45.814 --> 17:48.274
- What would you like to drink?
- Nothing, thanks.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.359
- D'you have any Bloody Mary mix?
- Yes.

17:50.527 --> 17:53.237
No, wait. Here's what I want.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.782
Regular tomato juice,
fill it up three quarters...

17:55.949 --> 17:58.284
then add a splash of Bloody Mary mix,
just a splash,

17:58.452 --> 18:00.495
and some lime on the side.

18:00.662 --> 18:03.164
The University of Chicago, right?

18:04.083 --> 18:05.041
Yes.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.585
Did you look this good
at the university?

18:07.753 --> 18:10.171
- No.
- Did we ever...?

18:10.339 --> 18:12.381
No. No!

18:13.175 --> 18:17.178
We drove from Chicago to New York
together after graduation.

18:17.346 --> 18:20.932
- Would you two like to sit together?
- Great! Thank you.

18:26.897 --> 18:29.398
You were a good friend of...

18:30.192 --> 18:33.569
Amanda's. I can't believe
you can't remember her name.

18:33.737 --> 18:36.197
What do you mean?
I can remember. Amanda Rice.

18:36.365 --> 18:39.033
- Reese.
- Reese, right. What happened to her?

18:39.201 --> 18:41.869
- I have no idea.
- You have no idea?!

18:42.037 --> 18:45.706
You were friends. We didn't make it
because you were such good friends.

18:45.874 --> 18:47.667
- You went with her!
- Was it worth it?

18:47.835 --> 18:50.044
The sacrifice, for a friend
you no longer see?

18:50.212 --> 18:52.713
Harry, you might not believe this...

18:52.881 --> 18:56.717
but I never considered
not sleeping with you a sacrifice.

18:56.885 --> 18:59.887
Fair enough. Fair enough.

19:03.058 --> 19:05.226
- You wanted to be a gymnast.
- Journalist.

19:05.394 --> 19:09.063
- That's what I said. And?
- I am a journalist. I work at The News.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.482
Great. And you're with Joe.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.402
Well, that's great. Great.

19:14.570 --> 19:17.446
You're together, what, three weeks?

19:18.115 --> 19:21.450
- A month. How did you know?
- You take someone to the airport...

19:21.618 --> 19:23.119
it's the beginning of a relationship.

19:23.287 --> 19:27.290
That is why I never
do that at the beginning.

19:27.457 --> 19:30.209
- Why?
- Because eventually things move on...

19:30.377 --> 19:33.546
and you don't take someone.
I never wanted anyone to say...

19:33.714 --> 19:36.090
"How come you never take me
to the airport any more?"

19:37.342 --> 19:42.263
It's amazing. You look normal,
but actually you are the Angel of Death.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.640
Are you gonna marry him?

19:45.601 --> 19:50.438
We have known each other a month and
neither of us wants to marry right now.

19:50.606 --> 19:51.689
I'm getting married.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.609
You are?

19:54.776 --> 19:57.028
- You are?
- Yeah.

19:57.738 --> 20:01.949
- Who is she?
- Helen Hillson. She's keeping her name.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.661
- You're getting married.
- Yeah.

20:06.705 --> 20:10.082
What's so funny about that?

20:11.084 --> 20:14.003
It's just... It's just
so optimistic of you, Harry.

20:14.171 --> 20:17.089
You'd be amazed what
falling madly in love can do for you.

20:17.257 --> 20:20.635
Well, it's wonderful.
It's nice to see you embracing life.

20:20.802 --> 20:24.805
Yeah. Plus, you get to a certain point
where you get tired of the whole thing.

20:24.973 --> 20:26.307
What whole thing?

20:26.475 --> 20:28.476
The whole "life of a single guy" thing.

20:28.644 --> 20:32.813
You meet someone, you have the safe
lunch, you decide to move on to dinner.

20:32.981 --> 20:36.317
You go dancing,
you do the white man's overbite...

20:36.818 --> 20:38.402
go back to her place, have sex,

20:38.570 --> 20:40.863
and then you know
what goes through your mind?

20:41.031 --> 20:44.575
"How long do I have to lie here
and hold her before I can go home?"

20:44.743 --> 20:46.786
"“Is 30 seconds enough?"

20:46.954 --> 20:49.705
That's what you're thinking?
Is that true?

20:49.873 --> 20:52.250
Sure. All men think that.

20:52.417 --> 20:55.628
How long do you like to be
held afterwards? All night, right?

20:55.796 --> 20:56.879
That's the problem.

20:57.047 --> 21:00.174
Somewhere between 30 seconds
and all night is your problem.

21:00.342 --> 21:02.843
- I don't have a problem.
- Yeah, you do.

21:17.901 --> 21:20.361
- Staying over?
- Yes.

21:20.529 --> 21:24.115
Would you like to have dinner?
Just friends.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.701
You don't believe
men and women can be friends.

21:26.868 --> 21:29.078
- When did I say that?
- On the ride to New York.

21:29.246 --> 21:31.539
No, no, no, no, I never said that.

21:32.165 --> 21:35.876
Yes, that's right.
They can't be friends.

21:36.044 --> 21:40.589
Unless both are involved with someone.
Then they can. I amend the earlier rule.

21:40.757 --> 21:42.216
If two people are in relationships,

21:42.384 --> 21:45.511
the pressure of possible involvement
is lifted.

21:46.430 --> 21:49.432
That doesn't work either.
The person you're with can't see...

21:49.599 --> 21:52.059
why you need to be friends
with the person...

21:52.227 --> 21:55.688
like it means something
is missing from the relationship.

21:55.856 --> 21:59.567
Then when you say "No, nothing
is missing," the person you're with...

21:59.735 --> 22:03.654
accuses you of being attracted to
the person you're just friends with...

22:03.822 --> 22:06.574
which you probably are.
I mean, let's face it.

22:06.742 --> 22:09.076
So we're back to the rule
before the amendment:

22:09.244 --> 22:11.954
Men and women can't be friends.
Where's it leave us?

22:12.122 --> 22:13.539
- Harry.
- What?

22:13.707 --> 22:14.790
Goodbye.

22:15.792 --> 22:17.084
OK.

22:24.426 --> 22:27.428
I'll just stop walking.
I'll let you go ahead.

22:31.099 --> 22:33.476
We were married 40 years ago.

22:33.643 --> 22:37.313
We were married three years, we got
a divorce. Then I married Marjorie.

22:37.481 --> 22:39.982
- First you lived with Barbara.
- Right, Barbara.

22:40.150 --> 22:42.651
But I didn't marry Barbara.
I married Marjorie.

22:42.819 --> 22:45.988
- Then you got a divorce.
- Right. Then I married Katie.

22:46.156 --> 22:47.782
Another divorce.

22:47.949 --> 22:52.828
Then a couple of years later at Eddie
Collecio's funeral, I ran into her.

22:52.996 --> 22:55.664
I was with some girl
I don't even remember.

22:55.832 --> 22:58.542
- Roberta.
- Right. Roberta.

22:58.710 --> 23:01.128
But I couldn't take my eyes off you.

23:01.296 --> 23:04.507
I remember I snuck over to her
and I said...

23:04.674 --> 23:07.802
- What did I say?
- You said "What are you doin' after?"

23:07.969 --> 23:12.473
Right. So I ditch Roberta, we go
for coffee, a month later we're married.

23:12.641 --> 23:15.810
35 years to the day
after our first marriage.

23:19.314 --> 23:22.233
- I went through his pockets.
- Marie, why?

23:22.401 --> 23:24.276
- You know what I found?
- No, what?

23:24.444 --> 23:29.323
They just bought a dining-room table.
His wife just spent $1,600 on a table.

23:29.491 --> 23:32.201
- Where?
- The point isn't where, Alice.

23:32.369 --> 23:34.495
The point is he's never gonna leave her.

23:34.663 --> 23:37.164
What else is new?
You've known this for two years.

23:37.332 --> 23:39.834
You're right. I know you're right.

23:40.001 --> 23:41.335
Can't you find someone single?

23:41.503 --> 23:43.546
When I was single
I knew lots of nice single men.

23:43.713 --> 23:46.841
There must be someone.
Sally found someone.

23:47.008 --> 23:49.218
Sally got the last good one.

23:49.386 --> 23:51.220
- Joe and I broke up.
- What?

23:51.388 --> 23:52.930
- When?
- Monday.

23:53.098 --> 23:55.266
- You waited three days?
- Joe's available?

23:55.434 --> 23:59.687
For God's sake, Marie, don't you
have feelings? She's obviously upset.

23:59.855 --> 24:02.815
I'm not that upset.
We'd been growing apart for a while.

24:02.983 --> 24:04.358
But you were a couple.

24:04.526 --> 24:08.237
You had someone to go places with.
You had a date on national holidays!

24:08.405 --> 24:12.032
I said to myself "You deserve
more than this. You're 31 ..."

24:12.200 --> 24:13.367
And the clock is ticking.

24:13.535 --> 24:16.537
No, it doesn't start
to tick until you're 36.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.998
God, you're in such great shape.

24:19.166 --> 24:23.252
Well, I've had a few days
to get used to it, and I feel OK.

24:23.420 --> 24:25.671
Good. Then you're ready.

24:27.090 --> 24:30.217
- Really, Marie!
- Well, how else do you think you do it?

24:30.385 --> 24:34.054
I've got the perfect guy. I don't
find him attractive, but you might.

24:34.222 --> 24:36.265
She doesn't have a problem with chins.

24:36.433 --> 24:40.186
- Marie, I'm not ready yet.
- But you just said you were over him.

24:40.353 --> 24:43.814
I am over him,
but I'm in a mourning period.

24:46.443 --> 24:48.777
- Who is it?
- Alex Anderson.

24:48.945 --> 24:50.070
Oh!

24:50.238 --> 24:52.740
You fixed me up with him six years ago.

24:52.908 --> 24:55.367
Sorry. God.

24:55.535 --> 24:57.953
All right, wait. Here. Here we go.

24:58.121 --> 25:01.707
- Ken Darman.
- He's been married for over a year.

25:01.875 --> 25:04.084
Really?

25:04.252 --> 25:06.253
Married.

25:06.421 --> 25:08.464
- Oh, wait. Wait, I got one.
- Look...

25:08.632 --> 25:11.425
there is no point going out
with someone I might like

25:11.593 --> 25:13.093
if I met him at the right time...

25:13.261 --> 25:16.931
but who right now would
just be a transitional man.

25:17.098 --> 25:21.727
OK, but don't wait too long. Remember
what happened with David Warsaw?

25:21.895 --> 25:23.604
His wife left him and everyone said

25:23.772 --> 25:26.398
"Give him some time.
Don't move in too fast."

25:26.566 --> 25:29.151
Six months later he was dead.

25:29.319 --> 25:33.072
Are you saying I should marry quickly
in case he's about to die?

25:33.240 --> 25:35.282
At least you could say you were married.

25:35.450 --> 25:38.619
I'm saying that the right man
is out there.

25:38.787 --> 25:41.080
If you don't grab him,
someone else will...

25:41.248 --> 25:43.624
and you'll spend your life
knowing that someone else

25:43.792 --> 25:45.793
is married to your husband.

25:50.090 --> 25:52.466
Ten! Hut!

26:06.856 --> 26:10.818
- When did this happen?
- Friday. Helen comes home from work...

26:10.986 --> 26:14.363
"..and she says “I don't know
if I wanna be married any more."

26:14.531 --> 26:15.781
Like it's the institution.

26:15.949 --> 26:20.035
Nothing personal, just something
she's been thinking about.

26:20.203 --> 26:23.539
I'm calm. I say "Why don't we
take time to think about it?"

26:23.707 --> 26:25.833
- "Don't rush into anything."
- Yeah, right.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.168
Next day she says
she's thought about it.

26:28.336 --> 26:31.589
She wants a trial separation.
She just wants to try it.

26:31.756 --> 26:35.050
But we can still date - like this
is supposed to cushion the blow.

26:35.218 --> 26:36.844
I got married so I could stop dating,

26:37.012 --> 26:39.346
so still dating
is not a big incentive...

26:39.514 --> 26:43.183
since the last thing you wanna do
is date your wife, who should love you.

26:43.351 --> 26:46.937
Which is what I'm saying to her,
when it occurs to me maybe she doesn't.

26:47.105 --> 26:49.857
So I say to her
"Don't you love me any more?"

26:50.025 --> 26:53.235
D'you know what she says?
“I don't know if I've ever loved you."

26:53.403 --> 26:57.615
Oooh! That's harsh. You don't
bounce back from that right away.

26:57.782 --> 27:00.743
- Thanks, Jess.
- No, I'm a writer. I know dialogue.

27:00.910 --> 27:02.536
That's particularly harsh.

27:02.704 --> 27:05.914
Then she says someone in her office
is going to South America...

27:06.082 --> 27:07.708
and she can sublet his apartment.

27:07.876 --> 27:10.628
I can't believe this.
And the doorbell rings.

27:10.795 --> 27:13.339
"“I can sublet his apartment" -
the words still hang in the air

27:13.506 --> 27:15.591
like in a balloon...

27:15.759 --> 27:17.051
- Like a cartoon.
- Right.

27:17.218 --> 27:20.012
So I go to the door and
there are moving men there.

27:20.180 --> 27:22.056
Now I start to get suspicious.

27:22.223 --> 27:25.934
I say "Helen, when did you call
these movers?" She doesn't say anything.

27:26.102 --> 27:28.896
So I ask the movers
"When did this woman book you?"

27:29.064 --> 27:30.898
And they're three huge guys.

27:31.066 --> 27:34.234
One with a T-shirt saying
"Don't fuck with Mr. Zero."

27:34.402 --> 27:39.782
So I said "Helen, when did you make this
arrangement?" She says "A week ago."

27:39.949 --> 27:43.118
I said "You've known for a week
and you didn't tell me?"

27:43.286 --> 27:46.747
And she says
“I didn't wanna ruin your birthday."

27:49.042 --> 27:52.086
Mr. Zero knew you were getting
a divorce a week before you?

27:52.253 --> 27:54.171
- Mr. Zero knew.
- I can't believe this!

27:54.339 --> 27:58.676
- I haven't told you the bad part yet.
- What's worse than Mr. Zero knowing?

27:58.843 --> 28:00.928
It's all a lie.

28:01.471 --> 28:05.599
She's in love with somebody else.
Some tax attorney.

28:05.767 --> 28:08.477
- She moved in with him.
- How did you find out?

28:09.938 --> 28:12.147
I followed her.
Stood outside the building.

28:12.315 --> 28:15.109
- That's so humiliating!
- Tell me about it.

28:15.276 --> 28:16.819
And, you know, I knew.

28:16.986 --> 28:19.655
I knew that even though we were happy,
it was an illusion.

28:19.823 --> 28:22.324
And that one day
she'd kick the shit outta me.

28:22.492 --> 28:25.369
Marriages don't break up
due to infidelity.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.788
It's a symptom something else is wrong.

28:27.956 --> 28:31.208
Oh, really?
Well, that symptom is fucking my wife!

28:35.463 --> 28:38.841
So I just happened to see
his American Express bill.

28:39.843 --> 28:42.136
What do you mean
"just happened" to see it?

28:42.470 --> 28:46.140
Well, he was shaving,
and there it was in his briefcase.

28:46.307 --> 28:48.851
What if he came out and saw you?

28:49.018 --> 28:51.854
You're missing the point.
I'm telling you what I found.

28:52.021 --> 28:57.276
He just spent $120
on a new nightgown for his wife.

28:58.486 --> 29:00.362
I don't think he's
ever gonna leave her.

29:00.530 --> 29:03.157
No one thinks he's
ever gonna leave her.

29:03.324 --> 29:05.993
You're right, you're right.
I know you're right.

29:21.551 --> 29:25.345
Someone is staring at you
in Personal Growth.

29:27.891 --> 29:31.894
I know him. You'd like him.
He's married.

29:32.061 --> 29:33.520
Who is he?

29:33.688 --> 29:36.315
Harry Burns.
He's a political consultant.

29:36.483 --> 29:38.358
He's cute.

29:38.526 --> 29:41.695
- You think he's cute?
- How do you know he's married?

29:41.863 --> 29:43.822
Last time I saw him
he was getting married.

29:43.990 --> 29:47.201
- When was that?
- Six years ago.

29:47.368 --> 29:50.370
So he might not be married any more.

29:50.538 --> 29:51.830
Also, he's obnoxious.

29:51.998 --> 29:56.794
It's like in The Lady Vanishes, when she
says "You're the most obnoxious man"...

29:56.961 --> 30:00.047
- "The most contemptible".
- Then they fall madly in love.

30:00.215 --> 30:02.716
- Also, he never remembers me.
- Sally Albright.

30:05.553 --> 30:07.638
- Hi, Harry.
- I thought it was you.

30:07.806 --> 30:10.474
It is. This is Marie.

30:12.018 --> 30:13.727
Was Marie.

30:13.895 --> 30:15.896
- How are you?
- Fine.

30:16.064 --> 30:18.857
- How's Joe?
- Fine.

30:19.025 --> 30:21.068
I hear he's fine.

30:21.236 --> 30:24.613
- You're not with Joe any more?
- We just broke up.

30:24.781 --> 30:28.408
Oh... I'm sorry. That's too bad.

30:29.244 --> 30:31.745
Yeah. Well, you know.

30:31.913 --> 30:33.288
Yeah.

30:33.456 --> 30:35.457
So...

30:35.625 --> 30:37.584
- What about you?
- I'm fine.

30:37.752 --> 30:39.878
How's married life?

30:40.922 --> 30:43.924
Not so good.
I'm getting a divorce.

30:44.092 --> 30:47.970
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm really sorry.

30:48.596 --> 30:51.431
Yeah, well, what're you gonna do?

30:51.599 --> 30:53.141
What happened with you guys?

30:53.309 --> 30:57.104
When Joe and I started seeing each other
we wanted the same thing.

30:57.272 --> 31:01.984
We didn't wanna get married because
every time anyone we knew got married...

31:02.151 --> 31:05.863
it ruined their relationship.
They practically never had sex again.

31:06.030 --> 31:09.908
It's true. That's one of the secrets
that no one ever tells you.

31:10.076 --> 31:12.786
I would sit with my girlfriends
who have kids...

31:12.954 --> 31:15.622
my one girlfriend with kids, Alice...

31:15.790 --> 31:19.960
and she would complain about
how she and Gary never did it any more.

31:20.128 --> 31:23.463
She didn't even complain about it.
She said it matter-of-factly.

31:23.631 --> 31:27.134
She said they were up all night,
they were both exhausted...

31:27.302 --> 31:31.013
the kids took every sexual impulse
they had out of them.

31:32.557 --> 31:37.352
Joe and I would say "We're so lucky.
We have this wonderful relationship."

31:37.520 --> 31:39.646
"We can have sex on the kitchen floor

31:39.814 --> 31:41.773
and not worry
about the kids walking in."

31:41.941 --> 31:45.819
"We can fly off to Rome
on a moment's notice."

31:46.863 --> 31:50.032
Then one day I was taking
Alice's girl for the afternoon...

31:50.199 --> 31:53.076
'cause I promised to
take her to the circus.

31:53.244 --> 31:55.787
We were in the cab playing I-spy.

31:55.955 --> 31:58.665
“I spy a mailbox, " “I spy a lamppost."

31:59.167 --> 32:02.711
And she looked out the window
and she saw this man and woman...

32:02.879 --> 32:04.004
with these two little kids,

32:04.172 --> 32:07.257
and the man had one of the kids
on his shoulders.

32:07.425 --> 32:10.802
"And she said “I spy a family."

32:12.096 --> 32:16.516
And I started to cry.
You know, I just started crying.

32:17.852 --> 32:20.520
And I went home and I said
"The thing is, Joe...

32:20.688 --> 32:23.815
we never do fly off to Rome
on a moment's notice."

32:23.983 --> 32:25.859
And the kitchen floor...?

32:26.402 --> 32:31.073
Not once. It's this very cold, hard,
Mexican ceramic tile.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.824
Oh.

32:33.368 --> 32:34.952
Anyway...

32:35.119 --> 32:36.703
we talked about it for a long time.

32:36.871 --> 32:40.415
I said "This is what I want"
and he said “I don't."

32:40.583 --> 32:44.044
And I said "Well, I guess it's over."
And he left.

32:46.881 --> 32:50.759
And the thing is, I...
I feel really fine.

32:50.927 --> 32:54.179
I am over him.
I mean, I really am over him.

32:54.347 --> 32:57.474
That was it for him.
That was the most that he could give.

32:57.642 --> 32:58.892
And every time I think about it,

32:59.060 --> 33:02.062
I am more and more convinced
I did the right thing.

33:02.897 --> 33:04.690
Boy, you sound really healthy.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.942
Yeah.

33:07.110 --> 33:10.737
- At least I got the apartment.
- That's what everybody says to me.

33:10.905 --> 33:13.407
But really, what's so hard
about finding an apartment?

33:13.574 --> 33:15.701
You read the obituary column.

33:15.868 --> 33:19.413
You find out who died, go to the
building, and then you tip the doorman.

33:19.580 --> 33:23.667
It'd be easier if they combined
obituaries with the real-estate section.

33:23.835 --> 33:27.087
Then you have "Mr. Klein died,
leaving a wife, two children..."

33:27.255 --> 33:32.134
and a spacious three-bedroom apartment
with a wood-burning fireplace."

33:34.429 --> 33:37.431
The first time we met
I really didn't like you that much.

33:37.598 --> 33:39.433
- I didn't like you.
- Yeah, you did.

33:39.600 --> 33:42.936
You were just so uptight then.
You're much softer now.

33:43.104 --> 33:47.107
I hate that kind of remark. It sounds
like a compliment, but it's an insult.

33:47.275 --> 33:49.359
OK, you're still as hard as nails.

33:49.527 --> 33:52.946
I didn't wanna sleep with you so you
wrote it off as a character flaw...

33:53.114 --> 33:54.865
instead of dealing
with the possibility

33:55.033 --> 33:57.325
it might have something to do with you.

33:58.786 --> 34:02.330
What's the statute of limitations
on apologies?

34:03.207 --> 34:04.166
Ten years.

34:04.333 --> 34:07.127
I can just get it in
under the wire.

34:11.841 --> 34:14.634
Would you like to have
dinner with me sometime?

34:15.011 --> 34:17.596
Are we becoming friends now?

34:18.973 --> 34:20.849
Well...

34:21.976 --> 34:23.310
Yeah.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.647
Great! A woman friend.

34:28.483 --> 34:30.358
You may be the first attractive woman

34:30.525 --> 34:33.820
I've not wanted to sleep with
in my entire life.

34:33.987 --> 34:36.322
That's wonderful, Harry.

34:37.492 --> 34:40.702
- We were born in the same hospital...
- In 1921.

34:40.870 --> 34:43.371
- ..Seven days apart.
- In the same hospital.

34:43.539 --> 34:46.666
- We both grew up one block apart.
- We lived in tenements.

34:46.833 --> 34:49.668
- On the Lower East Side.
- On Delancey Street.

34:49.837 --> 34:52.839
- I moved to the Bronx when I was ten.
- He lived on Fordham Road.

34:53.007 --> 34:55.967
- She moved when she was 11.
- I lived on 183rd Street.

34:56.135 --> 34:58.428
She worked on the 15th floor
as a nurse.

34:58.596 --> 35:01.348
I worked for a prominent neurologist...

35:01.516 --> 35:04.518
- I had a practice on the 14th floor.
- ..Dr. Permelman.

35:04.685 --> 35:07.020
- We never met.
- Never met.

35:07.188 --> 35:10.816
- Can you imagine that?
- D'you know where we met? An elevator.

35:10.983 --> 35:13.819
- I was visiting family.
- In the Ambassador Hotel.

35:13.986 --> 35:16.571
He was on the third floor,
I was on the 12th.

35:16.739 --> 35:20.367
I rode up nine extra floors
just to keep talking to her.

35:20.535 --> 35:23.036
Nine extra floors.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.715
- Hello.
- You sleeping?

35:35.883 --> 35:38.593
- No, I was watching "Casablanca."
- Channel?

35:38.761 --> 35:41.555
- Eleven.
- Thank you. Got it.

35:41.889 --> 35:45.684
So you'd be happier with Victor Laszlo
than with Humphrey Bogart?

35:45.852 --> 35:48.895
- When did I say that?
- When we drove to New York.

35:49.063 --> 35:53.567
- I never said that. I'd never say that.
- All right, fine. Have it your way.

35:55.403 --> 35:57.445
- Have you been sleeping?
- Why?

35:57.613 --> 36:01.575
'Cause I haven't been sleeping.
I really miss Helen.

36:02.910 --> 36:08.206
Maybe I'm coming down with something.
I watched "Leave It to Beaver" in Spanish.

36:08.374 --> 36:12.169
"Buenos días, Señor Cleaver.
¿Dónde están Wallace y Theodore?"

36:12.336 --> 36:13.545
I'm not well.

36:13.713 --> 36:17.591
I went to bed at 7:30.
I haven't done that since third grade.

36:17.758 --> 36:20.760
That's the good thing
about depression - you rest.

36:20.928 --> 36:23.972
- I'm not depressed.
- OK. Fine.

36:24.140 --> 36:26.975
Do you still sleep
on the same side of the bed?

36:27.143 --> 36:29.686
I did for a while,
but now I'm using the whole bed.

36:29.854 --> 36:34.858
God, that's great. I feel weird
when just my leg wanders over.

36:35.526 --> 36:37.360
I miss her.

36:37.945 --> 36:41.448
- I don't miss him. I really don't.
- Not even a little?

36:41.616 --> 36:43.617
You know what I miss?

36:43.784 --> 36:46.119
I miss the idea of him.

36:47.788 --> 36:50.290
Maybe I only miss the idea of Helen.

36:51.083 --> 36:53.585
No, I miss the whole Helen.

36:56.339 --> 36:58.465
Last scene.

37:01.636 --> 37:05.138
Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.

37:05.306 --> 37:08.475
Ingrid Bergman.
She's low maintenance.

37:08.643 --> 37:11.186
- Low maintenance?
- There are two kinds of women.

37:11.354 --> 37:15.649
- High maintenance and low maintenance.
- And Ingrid is low maintenance?

37:15.816 --> 37:17.651
An Im, definitely.

37:17.818 --> 37:19.819
- Which one am I?
- The worst kind.

37:19.987 --> 37:22.781
You're high maintenance,
but you think you're low.

37:22.949 --> 37:25.033
- I don't see that.
- You don't see that?

37:25.201 --> 37:28.286
"Waiter, a house salad,
but not the regular dressing."

37:28.454 --> 37:30.830
"“I'll have balsamic vinegar -
on the side."

37:30.998 --> 37:34.334
"Then salmon with mustard sauce,
but I want the sauce on the side."

37:34.502 --> 37:38.338
- "On the side" is a big thing for you.
- I just want it the way I want it.

37:38.506 --> 37:40.507
I know. High maintenance.

37:40.675 --> 37:43.718
10,000 franks should pay our expenses.

37:43.886 --> 37:45.887
Our expenses?

37:46.055 --> 37:50.517
Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

37:51.686 --> 37:55.188
Best last line of a movie ever.

37:58.025 --> 38:02.529
I'm definitely coming down with
something. Probably a 24-hour tumor.

38:02.697 --> 38:04.781
- You don't have a tumor.
- How do you know?

38:04.949 --> 38:09.953
- If you're so worried, go see a doctor.
- No, he'll just tell me it's nothing.

38:10.121 --> 38:12.622
- Will you be able to sleep?
- If not, I'll be OK.

38:12.790 --> 38:16.042
- What'll you do?
- I'll stay up and moan.

38:16.210 --> 38:21.214
Maybe I should practice now.

38:24.427 --> 38:26.928
Good night, Harry.

38:27.096 --> 38:29.222
Good night.

39:04.759 --> 39:08.803
I had my dream again - where I'm making
love and Olympic judges are watching?

39:08.971 --> 39:11.806
I'd nailed the compulsories,
so this is it: the finals.

39:11.974 --> 39:15.435
I got a 9.8 from the Canadian,
a perfect 10 from the American...

39:15.603 --> 39:19.105
and my mother, disguised as
an East German judge, gave me a 5.6.

39:19.273 --> 39:21.483
Must've been the dismount.

39:21.650 --> 39:24.819
Basically it's the same one
I've had since I was 12.

39:24.987 --> 39:27.697
- What happens?
- No, it's... It's too embarrassing.

39:27.865 --> 39:30.200
- Don't tell me.
- OK, there's this guy.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.868
What's he look like?

39:32.036 --> 39:33.995
I don't know.
He's just kinda faceless.

39:34.163 --> 39:37.457
A faceless guy. OK. Then what happens?

39:37.625 --> 39:39.626
He rips off my clothes.

39:39.794 --> 39:43.880
- Then what happens?
- That's it.

39:44.632 --> 39:47.509
That's it? A faceless guy
rips off your clothes.

39:47.676 --> 39:51.930
And that's the sex fantasy you've had
since you were 12. Exactly the same?

39:52.098 --> 39:54.808
Well, sometimes I vary it a little.

39:54.975 --> 39:57.477
- Which part?
- What I'm wearing.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.984
- What?
- Nothing.

40:06.821 --> 40:10.365
I have decided that for today...

40:10.533 --> 40:13.159
we are going to talk like this.

40:13.327 --> 40:16.496
- Like this?
- No. To repeat after me.

40:16.664 --> 40:17.705
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

40:17.873 --> 40:18.832
- Pepper.
- Pepper!

40:18.999 --> 40:20.583
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

40:20.751 --> 40:25.004
Waiter, there is too much pepper
on my paprikash.

40:25.673 --> 40:30.009
Waiter, there is too much pepper
on my paprikash.

40:30.177 --> 40:33.430
But I would be proud
to partake of your pecan pie.

40:33.597 --> 40:35.223
Oh, no!

40:35.391 --> 40:37.392
- But I would be proud.
- But I would be proud.

40:37.560 --> 40:38.685
- To partake.
- To partake.

40:38.853 --> 40:41.855
- Of your pecan pie.
- Of your pecan pie.

40:42.022 --> 40:43.565
- Pecan pie.
- Pecan pie.

40:43.732 --> 40:47.360
- Pecan pie.
- Pecan pie!

40:47.528 --> 40:51.030
- Would you like to go to the movies?
- Would you like to go...

40:51.198 --> 40:57.120
Not to repeat. Please, to answer. Would
you like to go to the movies tonight?

40:57.288 --> 41:01.332
Oh... Oh...
Well, I'd love to, Harry, but I can't.

41:01.500 --> 41:04.544
What do you have? A hot date?

41:04.712 --> 41:07.213
- Well, yeah. Yeah.
- Really?

41:07.381 --> 41:09.507
Yeah. I was gonna tell you,
but, I don't know,

41:09.675 --> 41:12.051
- I felt strange about it.
- Why?

41:12.219 --> 41:14.262
'Cause we've spent
so much time together.

41:14.430 --> 41:17.056
I think it's great that you have a date.

41:17.224 --> 41:19.267
- You do?
- Yeah.

41:25.816 --> 41:28.651
- Is that what you're gonna wear?
- Yeah.

41:28.819 --> 41:31.946
Well... I don't know. Why?

41:32.364 --> 41:35.992
I think you should wear skirts more.
You look really good in skirts.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.786
- I do?
- Yeah.

41:40.247 --> 41:45.335
I think hieroglyphics are really a comic
strip about a character named Sphinxy.

41:45.503 --> 41:49.088
- Harry, you should get out there, too.
- Oh, I'm not ready.

41:49.256 --> 41:52.717
- You should.
- I would not be good for anybody now.

41:52.885 --> 41:54.594
It's time.

41:54.762 --> 41:58.097
It was the most
uncomfortable night of my life.

41:58.265 --> 42:00.308
See, no, it has to go this way.

42:01.435 --> 42:04.187
The first date back
is always the toughest, Harry.

42:04.355 --> 42:06.356
You only had one date.

42:06.524 --> 42:09.943
- How do you know it won't get worse?
- How much worse can it get...

42:10.110 --> 42:15.615
than finishing dinner, having him pull
a hair out of my head and floss with it?

42:15.783 --> 42:18.618
We're talking dream date
compared to my horror.

42:18.786 --> 42:22.288
It started out fine.
She's a very nice person.

42:22.456 --> 42:26.125
And we're talking in this Ethiopian
restaurant she wanted to go to.

42:26.293 --> 42:29.629
"I was making jokes, like “I didn't
know they had food in Ethiopia."

42:29.797 --> 42:33.508
"This'll be a quick meal. I'll order
two empty plates and we can leave."

42:33.676 --> 42:35.969
Yeah! Nothing from her,
not even a smile.

42:36.136 --> 42:39.305
I downshift into small talk
and ask where she went to school.

42:39.473 --> 42:42.725
She says Michigan State.
And this reminds me of Helen.

42:42.893 --> 42:46.020
All of a sudden I'm in the middle
of an anxiety attack...

42:46.188 --> 42:49.148
my heart's beatin' fast
and I start sweatin' like a pig.

42:49.316 --> 42:52.277
- Helen went to Michigan State?
- No, Northwestern.

42:52.444 --> 42:54.654
But they're both Big Ten schools.

42:54.822 --> 42:57.907
I got so upset
I had to leave the restaurant.

42:59.910 --> 43:02.245
Harry, I think this takes a long time.

43:02.413 --> 43:06.666
It might be months before we're able
to enjoy going out with someone new.

43:06.834 --> 43:07.750
Yeah.

43:07.918 --> 43:11.170
Maybe longer before we're able
to go to bed with someone new.

43:11.338 --> 43:13.715
Oh, I went to bed with her.

43:14.967 --> 43:17.885
- You went to bed with her?!
- Sure.

43:18.762 --> 43:19.804
Oh.

43:23.851 --> 43:26.853
- I don't understand this relationship.
- What d'ya mean?

43:27.021 --> 43:28.688
- Enjoy being with her?
- Yeah.

43:28.856 --> 43:30.857
- You find her attractive?
- Yeah.

43:31.025 --> 43:33.192
- And you're not sleeping with her?
- No.

43:33.360 --> 43:35.528
You're afraid to let yourself be happy.

43:35.696 --> 43:39.073
Why can't you gimme credit for this?
This is a big thing for me.

43:39.241 --> 43:43.077
I never had a relationship with a woman
that didn't involve sex. I'm growing.

43:43.245 --> 43:44.954
Are you finished?

43:45.122 --> 43:46.873
I got a stack o' quarters.
I was here first.

43:47.041 --> 43:48.082
- Were not.
- Was too.

43:48.250 --> 43:49.917
- Were not!
- Was too!

43:50.085 --> 43:52.629
- Big jerk.
- Little creep.

43:52.796 --> 43:54.714
- Where was I?
- You were growing.

43:54.882 --> 43:56.382
Yeah.

43:56.550 --> 43:59.802
It's very freeing.
I can say anything to her.

44:00.429 --> 44:03.723
Are you saying you can say things to her
you can't say to me?

44:03.891 --> 44:06.392
No, it's just a different perspective.

44:06.560 --> 44:08.686
I get the woman's
point of view on things.

44:08.854 --> 44:12.565
She tells me about the men she sees,
and I talk to her about the women I see.

44:12.733 --> 44:14.859
- You tell her about other women?
- Yeah.

44:15.027 --> 44:18.613
Like the other night, I made love
to this woman and it was incredible.

44:18.781 --> 44:22.492
I took her to a place that wasn't human.
She actually meowed.

44:22.660 --> 44:23.785
You made a woman meow?

44:23.952 --> 44:27.121
Yeah, and I can say
these things to her.

44:27.289 --> 44:28.289
And the great thing is,

44:28.457 --> 44:31.668
I don't have to lie because
I don't wanna get her into bed.

44:31.835 --> 44:35.922
- I can just be myself.
- You made a woman meow?

44:36.924 --> 44:39.926
What do you do with these women?
Just get up and leave?

44:40.094 --> 44:41.094
Sure.

44:41.261 --> 44:43.471
Explain how you do it.
What do you say?

44:43.639 --> 44:46.182
I say I have an early meeting,
early squash game.

44:46.350 --> 44:47.308
You don't play squash.

44:47.476 --> 44:50.103
They don't know that.
They just met me.

44:50.771 --> 44:53.231
- That's disgusting.
- I know. I feel terrible.

44:53.399 --> 44:55.942
I'm so glad I never
got involved with you.

44:56.110 --> 45:00.071
I just would've been some woman you
had to get outta bed and leave at 3am...

45:00.239 --> 45:03.449
and go clean your andirons.
You don't even have a fireplace.

45:03.617 --> 45:04.909
Not that I would know this.

45:05.077 --> 45:07.412
Why are you upset?
This isn't about you.

45:07.579 --> 45:11.749
Yes, it is! You are a human affront
to all women, and I am a woman.

45:11.917 --> 45:14.669
Hey, I don't hear anyone complaining.

45:14.837 --> 45:17.255
Of course not.
You're out the door too fast.

45:17.423 --> 45:21.259
- I think they have an OK time.
- How do you know?

45:21.802 --> 45:24.137
What d'ya mean how do I know? I know.

45:24.304 --> 45:28.141
- Because they...
- Yes, because they...

45:28.726 --> 45:33.855
- How do you know that they're really...
- What're you saying? They fake orgasm?

45:34.314 --> 45:36.649
- It's possible.
- Get outta here!

45:36.817 --> 45:39.902
Why? Most women
at one time or another have faked it.

45:40.320 --> 45:43.239
- They haven't faked it with me.
- How do you know?

45:44.366 --> 45:46.117
Because I know.

45:47.619 --> 45:50.747
Oh. Right. That's right.

45:50.914 --> 45:53.166
I forgot. You're a man.

45:53.333 --> 45:55.543
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

45:55.711 --> 45:59.422
All men are sure it never happened
to them and most women have done it...

45:59.590 --> 46:00.840
so you do the math.

46:01.800 --> 46:04.343
You don't think I
could tell the difference?

46:04.511 --> 46:07.346
- No.
- Get outta here.

46:16.356 --> 46:18.441
Oh.

46:21.361 --> 46:23.362
Are you OK?

46:27.367 --> 46:29.368
Oh, God.

46:30.120 --> 46:32.205
Oh, God.

46:33.040 --> 46:35.166
Oh.

46:37.377 --> 46:39.420
Oh...

46:39.588 --> 46:42.215
Oh, God.

46:42.382 --> 46:44.050
Oh, yeah, right there.

46:46.386 --> 46:50.515
Oh... Oh... Oh...

46:50.682 --> 46:52.809
Oh, God. Oh...

46:52.976 --> 46:56.062
Yes! Yes! Yes!

46:56.230 --> 46:57.897
Yes! Yes!

46:58.065 --> 47:01.400
Yes! Oh!

47:01.568 --> 47:05.780
Oh, yes! Yes! Yes! Oh!

47:05.948 --> 47:11.410
Yes! Yes! Yes!

47:11.578 --> 47:15.081
Oh! Oh... Oh...

47:15.249 --> 47:17.291
Oh, God.

47:17.459 --> 47:19.293
Oh.

47:27.135 --> 47:29.011
I'll have what she's having.

- Wanna get some air?

49:48.568 --> 49:51.570
- Yeah.
- Seven, six, five, four...

49:51.738 --> 49:54.073
three, two, one!

49:54.241 --> 49:58.244
Happy New Year!

50:17.681 --> 50:19.849
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

50:27.315 --> 50:29.817
He was a head counselor
at the boys' camp,

50:29.985 --> 50:32.570
I was a head counselor
at the girls' camp...

50:32.738 --> 50:36.615
and they had a social one night,
and he walked across the room.

50:36.783 --> 50:39.785
I thought he was coming
to talk to my friend Maxine...

50:39.953 --> 50:43.622
'cause people were always
crossing rooms to talk to Maxine.

50:43.790 --> 50:46.625
But he was coming to talk to me,
and he said...

50:46.793 --> 50:49.754
"“I'm Ben Small
of the Coney Island Smalls."

50:49.921 --> 50:54.425
At that moment I knew. I knew
the way you know about a good melon.

50:56.344 --> 50:58.971
You sent flowers to yourself.

50:59.139 --> 51:02.892
$60 I spent on this big arrangement
of flowers, and I wrote a card...

51:03.060 --> 51:04.518
that I planned to leave on the table

51:04.686 --> 51:07.146
where Arthur would
just happen to see it.

51:07.314 --> 51:09.565
What did the card say?

51:09.733 --> 51:12.318
"Please say yes. Love Jonathan."

51:12.486 --> 51:14.570
- Did it work?
- He never even came over.

51:14.738 --> 51:18.824
He forgot a charity thing his wife is
chairman of. He's never gonna leave her!

51:18.992 --> 51:22.328
- Of course he isn't.
- You're right. I know you're right.

51:22.496 --> 51:25.331
- Where is this place?
- Somewhere on the next block.

51:25.499 --> 51:28.000
Oh! I can't believe I'm doing this.

51:28.168 --> 51:31.670
Harry is one of my best friends
and you are one of my best friends.

51:31.838 --> 51:33.672
And if you two hit it off,

51:33.840 --> 51:36.175
we could still be friends,
instead of drifting apart...

51:36.343 --> 51:39.386
like you do when you date someone
who doesn't know your friends.

51:39.554 --> 51:43.557
You and I haven't drifted apart
since I started seeing Arthur.

51:43.725 --> 51:47.353
If Arthur ever left his wife
and I actually met him...

51:47.521 --> 51:50.940
I am sure that
you and I would drift apart.

51:51.108 --> 51:53.192
He's never gonna leave her.

51:53.360 --> 51:55.361
Of course he isn't.

51:55.529 --> 51:57.696
You're right. I know you're right.

51:58.198 --> 52:00.407
- I dunno about this.
- It's just a dinner.

52:00.575 --> 52:05.704
I've finally gotten to a place where I'm
comfortable with just me and my work.

52:05.872 --> 52:07.373
If she's so great
why don't you date her?

52:07.541 --> 52:09.625
I told you. We're just friends.

52:09.793 --> 52:12.586
- So she's not attractive?
- No, she is attractive.

52:12.754 --> 52:17.383
- You said she had a good personality.
- She has a good personality.

52:18.969 --> 52:20.386
What?

52:20.554 --> 52:24.765
When someone's not attractive, they're
described as having a good personality.

52:24.933 --> 52:28.727
If you'd asked about looks and I'd
said "She has a good personality"...

52:28.895 --> 52:30.604
she's not attractive.

52:30.772 --> 52:34.275
But because I mentioned she has
a good personality, she can be either.

52:34.442 --> 52:38.237
Attractive with a good personality, or
not attractive with a good personality.

52:38.405 --> 52:40.406
- So which one is she?
- Attractive.

52:40.574 --> 52:42.867
But not beautiful, right?

52:45.412 --> 52:47.663
It's like,
whenever I read Jimmy Breslin,

52:47.831 --> 52:50.499
it's as if he's leaving
a wake-up call...

52:50.667 --> 52:54.753
- ..for the City of New York.
- What d'you mean by a "wake-up call"?

52:54.921 --> 52:59.258
He's saying that we've got people
in the city who are on welfare...

53:00.594 --> 53:02.595
Would I have seen any of your windows?

53:02.762 --> 53:07.224
A couple of weeks ago
I did a thing with hostages.

53:07.392 --> 53:09.268
- The people in blindfolds.
- Yeah.

53:09.686 --> 53:12.938
I thought it was like late '80s.

53:13.607 --> 53:14.940
That's interesting.

53:15.108 --> 53:18.068
Let's just say I'm not
a big fan of Jimmy Breslin.

53:18.236 --> 53:22.781
Well, he's the reason I became a writer,
but that's not important.

53:35.629 --> 53:39.131
Harry, you and Marie
are both from New Jersey.

53:39.299 --> 53:40.799
- Really?
- Where?

53:40.967 --> 53:42.509
- South Orange.
- Haddonfield.

53:42.677 --> 53:44.553
Oh!

53:50.602 --> 53:52.144
So, what are we gonna order?

53:52.312 --> 53:54.647
I'm gonna start with
the grilled radicchio.

53:54.814 --> 53:58.192
Jess, Sally is a great orderer.
Not only does she pick the best...

53:58.360 --> 54:01.695
but she orders it in a way even the
chef didn't know how good it could be.

54:01.863 --> 54:05.199
- Restaurants have become too important.
- Oh, I agree.

54:05.367 --> 54:09.662
"Restaurants are to people in the '80s
what theatre was to people in the '60s."

54:09.829 --> 54:11.664
I read that in a magazine.

54:12.332 --> 54:14.375
I wrote that.

54:14.542 --> 54:17.169
- Get outta here.
- No, I did! I wrote that.

54:17.337 --> 54:20.714
I've never quoted anything
from a magazine. That's amazing.

54:20.882 --> 54:23.425
Don't you think that's amazing?
And you wrote it?

54:24.552 --> 54:27.012
I also wrote
"Pesto is the quiche of the '80s."

54:27.180 --> 54:29.890
- Get over yourself!
- I did!

54:30.058 --> 54:32.685
- Where did I read that?
- New York Magazine.

54:32.852 --> 54:35.187
Sally writes for New York Magazine.

54:35.355 --> 54:37.856
You know, that piece
had a real impact on me.

54:38.024 --> 54:39.733
I don't know much about writing...

54:39.901 --> 54:42.236
It spoke to you, and that pleases me.

54:42.404 --> 54:45.698
I mean, you have to admire people
who can be that articulate.

54:45.865 --> 54:49.535
Nobody has ever quoted
me back to me before.

54:58.962 --> 55:02.298
Oh! I've been looking for
a red suede pump.

55:04.718 --> 55:07.219
What do you think of Jess?

55:08.138 --> 55:09.263
Well...

55:09.431 --> 55:11.557
Do you think you
could go out with him?

55:12.392 --> 55:13.392
I don't know...

55:13.560 --> 55:16.186
'Cause I feel really
comfortable with him.

55:16.354 --> 55:19.565
- You wanna go out with Jess.
- If it would be all right with you.

55:19.733 --> 55:22.651
Sure. Sure.
I'm just worried about Harry.

55:22.819 --> 55:25.279
He's sensitive,
he's going through a rough period,

55:25.447 --> 55:27.906
and I don't want you to reject him.

55:28.074 --> 55:30.284
I wouldn't. I totally understand.

55:30.452 --> 55:33.912
If you don't think you're gonna
call Marie, do you mind if I call her?

55:34.080 --> 55:35.706
- No, no.
- Good. Good.

55:35.874 --> 55:40.002
But for tonight you shouldn't. I mean,
Sally's very vulnerable right now.

55:40.170 --> 55:44.131
You can call Marie, but wait a week
or so. Don't make any moves tonight.

55:44.299 --> 55:47.968
Fine. No problem.
I wasn't even thinking about tonight.

55:48.595 --> 55:52.222
Well, I don't feel like walking
any more. I think I'll get a cab.

55:52.390 --> 55:55.476
- I'll go with you.
- Great! Taxi!

56:06.780 --> 56:12.659
"A man came to me and said
“I found nice girl for you."

56:12.827 --> 56:16.955
"She lives in the next village...

56:17.123 --> 56:20.459
and she is ready for marriage."

56:21.628 --> 56:25.839
We were not supposed to meet
until the wedding...

56:26.007 --> 56:28.050
but I wanted to make sure.

56:28.218 --> 56:32.513
So I sneak into her village,
hid behind a tree...

56:32.680 --> 56:35.474
watch her washing the clothes.

56:36.226 --> 56:41.980
I think if I don't like the way
she looks, I don't marry her.

56:42.148 --> 56:44.983
But she looked very nice to me.

56:45.151 --> 56:48.237
So I said "OK" to the man.

56:48.988 --> 56:50.739
We get married.

56:50.907 --> 56:53.992
We married for 55 years.

57:01.126 --> 57:04.294
- I have to get this.
- Harry, we're here for Jess and Marie.

57:04.462 --> 57:08.298
- We'll find something. Great stuff.
- Should have gone to the plant store.

57:08.466 --> 57:11.677
- Here. Perfect for them.
- What's that?

57:11.845 --> 57:14.513
Battery-operated pith helmet, with fan.

57:14.681 --> 57:17.516
- Why is this necessary in life?
- I don't know.

57:17.684 --> 57:20.727
Look at this. Also makes great fries.

57:20.895 --> 57:24.773
Oh, oh-oh. Good.
Call off the dogs. The hunt is over.

57:24.941 --> 57:27.818
Sally, this is the greatest.

57:27.986 --> 57:30.237
Sally, please report to me.

57:30.405 --> 57:33.157
Look. This is the greatest.
You're gonna love this.

57:33.324 --> 57:38.579
This is a singing machine. Look, you
sing the lead and this has the backup.

57:38.746 --> 57:41.832
- This is from Oklahoma!
- "Surrey with the Fringe on Top."

57:42.000 --> 57:44.710
Yes, perfect.

57:46.337 --> 57:49.298

58:19.120 --> 58:22.164
It's my voice, isn't it?
You hate my voice.

58:22.332 --> 58:25.792
- I know, it's terrible. Joe hated it...
- It's Helen.

58:25.960 --> 58:27.878
Helen?

58:28.046 --> 58:29.755
She's coming right towards me.

58:38.264 --> 58:41.808
- How are you, Harry?
- Fine. I'm fine.

58:43.603 --> 58:46.313
This is lra Stone. Harry Burns.

58:46.481 --> 58:48.357
Harry.

58:52.737 --> 58:55.781
I'm sorry. This is Sally Albright.
Helen Hillson...

58:55.949 --> 58:57.824
and lra.

58:57.992 --> 58:59.826
Sally.

58:59.994 --> 59:03.163
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

59:05.375 --> 59:07.292
Well...

59:08.002 --> 59:11.421
- See you.
- Yeah. Bye.

59:12.715 --> 59:15.217
Nice to meet you... lra.

59:20.348 --> 59:22.432
You OK?

59:23.643 --> 59:26.103
Yeah, I'm perfect.

59:26.271 --> 59:29.606
She looked weird, didn't she?
She looked really weird.

59:29.774 --> 59:33.485
- I've never seen her before.
- Trust me. Her legs looked heavy.

59:33.653 --> 59:35.445
- Must be retaining water.
- Harry!

59:35.613 --> 59:38.365
Believe me, the woman saved everything.

59:41.452 --> 59:43.453
Sure you're OK?

59:43.621 --> 59:46.540
Oh, I'm fine.
Look, it had to happen at some point.

59:46.708 --> 59:49.293
In a city of eight million,
you're bound to run into your ex-wife.

59:49.460 --> 59:50.836
So it happened.

59:51.004 --> 59:53.088
And now I'm fine.

59:56.092 --> 59:58.802
I like it. It works.
It says "home" to me.

59:58.970 --> 01:00:02.848
All right. All right.
We'll let Harry and Sally be the judge.

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:05.892
What do you think?

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:07.936
- It's nice.
- Case closed.

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:10.522
Of course he likes it - he's a guy.

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:12.774
Sally?

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.861
What's so awful about it?

01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:19.948
It's so awful, there's no way to begin
to explain what's so awful about it.

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:22.492
Honey, I don't object to your things.

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:26.246
If we had room, you could put your
things in it, like your bar stools...

01:00:26.414 --> 01:00:30.375
Honey, wait, wait. Honey, wait.
You don't like my bar stools?

01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:33.795
Harry, come on,
someone has to be on my side.

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:36.757
I'm on your side.
I just want you to have good taste.

01:00:36.924 --> 01:00:39.134
I have good taste!

01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:44.264
Everybody thinks they have good taste,
but they couldn't all have good taste.

01:00:44.432 --> 01:00:48.268
You know, it's funny.
We started out like this, Helen and I.

01:00:48.436 --> 01:00:52.856
We hung things, we picked out tiles
together. Then you know what happens?

01:00:53.024 --> 01:00:58.528
Six years later you're singing "Surrey
with the Fringe on Top" in front of lra!

01:00:58.696 --> 01:01:00.572
Do we have to talk
about this right now?

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:03.492
Yes. Right now is the perfect time...

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:07.663
because I want our friends to benefit
from the wisdom of my experience.

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:09.081
Right now everything is great.

01:01:09.248 --> 01:01:12.376
Everyone is happy and in love,
and that's wonderful.

01:01:12.543 --> 01:01:15.879
But sooner or later,
you'll be screaming at each other

01:01:16.047 --> 01:01:17.839
about who'll get this dish.

01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:20.967
This $8 dish will cost $1,000 in calls

01:01:21.135 --> 01:01:23.095
to the legal firm of
"That's mine, this is yours."

01:01:23.262 --> 01:01:25.138
- Harry!
- Please.

01:01:25.306 --> 01:01:28.475
Jess, Marie,
do me a favor for your own good.

01:01:28.643 --> 01:01:32.938
Put your name in your books right now
before you don't know whose is whose...

01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:38.110
because some day you'll go 15 rounds
over who's gonna get this coffee table.

01:01:38.277 --> 01:01:43.949
This stupid, wagon-wheel,
Roy-Rogers, garage-sale coffee table!

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:49.454
- I thought you liked it.
- I was being nice!

01:01:53.793 --> 01:01:55.877
He just bumped into Helen.

01:02:03.511 --> 01:02:06.304
I want you to know...

01:02:06.472 --> 01:02:10.642
that I will never want
that wagon-wheel coffee table.

01:02:18.776 --> 01:02:20.318
I know, I know,

01:02:20.486 --> 01:02:22.320
I shouldn't have done it.

01:02:22.488 --> 01:02:24.406
Harry, you have to try to find a way

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:27.284
of not expressing
every feeling you have...

01:02:27.452 --> 01:02:29.453
every moment that you have them.

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:32.122
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:35.000
There are times and places for things.

01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:38.336
Well, the next time you're giving
a lecture on social graces,

01:02:38.504 --> 01:02:40.922
tell me 'cause I'll sign up.

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:44.676
Hey! You don't have
to take your anger out on me.

01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:48.221
I'm entitled to throw anger your way.
Especially when I'm being told

01:02:48.389 --> 01:02:50.849
how to live my life
by Miss Hospital Corners!

01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:54.811
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing bothers you!

01:02:54.979 --> 01:02:58.648
- You never get upset about anything!
- Don't be ridiculous!

01:02:58.816 --> 01:03:00.066
What?

01:03:00.234 --> 01:03:01.735
You never get upset about Joe.

01:03:01.903 --> 01:03:04.529
I never see it back up on you.
How is it possible?

01:03:04.697 --> 01:03:08.700
- Don't you experience feelings of loss?
- I don't have to take this crap.

01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:11.578
If you're over Joe,
why not see people?

01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:12.871
I see people!

01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:16.333
See people! Have you slept
with one person since Joe?

01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:19.252
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:23.298
That will prove I'm over Joe
because I fuck somebody?!

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:25.133
You have to move back to New Jersey

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:27.052
'cause you've slept
with everyone in New York.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:30.514
I don't see that turning Helen
into a faint memory for you.

01:03:31.182 --> 01:03:34.184
Besides, I will make love
when it is making love.

01:03:34.352 --> 01:03:37.813
Not the way you do it, like you're
out for revenge or something.

01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:40.065
Are you finished now?

01:03:41.734 --> 01:03:43.193
Yes.

01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:45.695
Can I say something?

01:03:45.863 --> 01:03:47.531
Yes.

01:03:50.159 --> 01:03:52.869
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:06.174
Don't say a word!

01:04:09.804 --> 01:04:12.889
It's a monkey, a monkey.
Monkey see, monkey do.

01:04:13.057 --> 01:04:16.476
- It's an ape. Going ape.
- It's a baby!

01:04:16.644 --> 01:04:18.770
- Planet of the Apes!
- She said baby!

01:04:18.938 --> 01:04:19.938
Try Planet of the Dopes.

01:04:20.106 --> 01:04:23.900
- It doesn't look like a baby.
- Big mouth. Jagger as a baby.

01:04:24.068 --> 01:04:26.611
- Baby ape!
- Stop with the apes.

01:04:26.779 --> 01:04:29.948
- Baby's breath.
- Rosemary's Baby's... mouth?

01:04:30.116 --> 01:04:32.617
- "Won't You Come Home, Bill Baby?"
- Kiss the baby!

01:04:32.785 --> 01:04:37.330
- "Melancholy Baby's Mouth!"
- Baby fish... Baby-fish mouth!

01:04:38.207 --> 01:04:40.083
- 15 seconds.
- A big mouth.

01:04:40.251 --> 01:04:42.210
- Baby boom!
- Baby...

01:04:42.378 --> 01:04:44.963
Draw something
resembling anything!

01:04:45.131 --> 01:04:48.758
- Crying baby. Kiss the baby.
- Baby spitting up... Exorcist baby!

01:04:48.968 --> 01:04:52.721
- "Yes Sir, That's My Baby."
- "No sir, don't mean maybe."

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:55.640
- That's it. Time's up.
- Baby talk.

01:04:55.808 --> 01:04:59.144
Baby talk? What's that?
That's not a saying.

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:02.772
But "baby-fish mouth" is sweeping
the nation. I hear them talking!

01:05:03.441 --> 01:05:05.901
Final score. Our team: 110.

01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:08.028
You guys: 60.

01:05:08.195 --> 01:05:11.406
- Fix! Definitely a fix.
- Pathetic.

01:05:11.866 --> 01:05:13.658
- I can't draw.
- No...

01:05:13.826 --> 01:05:16.786
That's a baby,
and it's clearly talking.

01:05:16.954 --> 01:05:18.747
You're wonderful.

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:21.750
- Who wants coffee?
- I do, and I love you.

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:24.711
- D'you have tea?
- Industrial strength.

01:05:24.879 --> 01:05:28.423
- I'll help you. Decaf?
- Yeah.

01:05:29.216 --> 01:05:31.134
- Three.
- Yes, please.

01:05:31.302 --> 01:05:34.346
- Where's the bathroom?
- Through that door, down the hall.

01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:43.271
Never looked like a baby to me.

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:44.898
- Which part?
- All of it.

01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:48.401
- You were gonna show me a book cover.
- Yeah, it's in the den.

01:05:48.569 --> 01:05:52.781
Julian, help yourself.
Have some more wine, whatever, OK?

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:55.241
I like saying den.
Got a nice ring to it.

01:05:55.743 --> 01:05:58.536
Emily's a little young for Harry,
don't you think?

01:05:58.704 --> 01:06:01.456
Well, she's young,
but look what she's done.

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:03.917
What has she done? She makes desserts.

01:06:04.085 --> 01:06:06.002
Does Julian seem
a little stuffy to you?

01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:08.463
He's a good guy.
You should talk to him.

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:10.006
He's too tall to talk to.

01:06:10.174 --> 01:06:13.343
She makes 3,500
chocolate-mousse pies a week.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.888
Emily is "Aunt Emily?"

01:06:17.056 --> 01:06:19.516
He took us to a Met game
last week. It was great.

01:06:19.684 --> 01:06:21.476
You all went to a Met game together?

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:24.145
Yeah, but...
it was a last-minute thing.

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:25.689
But Sally hates baseball.

01:06:25.856 --> 01:06:28.066
Harry doesn't even like sweets.

01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:30.735
Julian is great.

01:06:30.903 --> 01:06:32.862
I know. He's a grown-up.

01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:34.239
Emily is terrific.

01:06:34.407 --> 01:06:36.408
Yeah. But when I asked
where she was...

01:06:36.575 --> 01:06:38.743
when Kennedy was shot,
she said "Ted Kennedy was shot?"

01:06:38.911 --> 01:06:39.911
No.

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:54.134
- Hello?
- Are you alone?

01:06:54.301 --> 01:06:56.344
Yeah. I was just finishing a book.

01:06:56.512 --> 01:06:59.305
- Could you come over?
- What's the matter?

01:06:59.473 --> 01:07:02.517
- He's getting married.
- Who?

01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:04.728
Joe!

01:07:04.895 --> 01:07:06.980
I'll be right there.

01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:14.237
- Hi.
- Are you all right?

01:07:16.657 --> 01:07:18.950
Come on in.

01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:24.748
- I'm sorry to call you so late.
- It's all right.

01:07:26.208 --> 01:07:28.293
- I need a Kleenex!
- OK.

01:07:28.461 --> 01:07:29.919
OK. OK.

01:07:30.087 --> 01:07:33.298
He just called me up,
"Wanted to see how you were"...

01:07:33.466 --> 01:07:35.842
"Fine. How are you?" "Fine."

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:39.596
His secretary's on vacation,
everything's all backed up.

01:07:39.764 --> 01:07:43.558
He's got a big case in Newark,
blah, blah, blah.

01:07:44.643 --> 01:07:48.897
And I'm sitting on the phone thinking
“I am over him, I really am over him...

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:53.193
"..I can't believe I was ever
remotely interested in any of this."

01:07:54.195 --> 01:07:57.530
"And then he said “I have some news."

01:08:01.327 --> 01:08:05.705
She works in his office.
She's a paralegal. Her name is Kimberly.

01:08:07.541 --> 01:08:09.542
He just met her!

01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:15.256
She's supposed to be his
transitional person, not "the one!"

01:08:20.638 --> 01:08:25.433
All this time... I've been saying...
that he didn't wanna get married.

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:29.062
But the truth is...

01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:31.939
he didn't wanna marry me.

01:08:35.027 --> 01:08:37.319
He didn't love me.

01:08:41.367 --> 01:08:44.035
If you could take him back
right now, would you?

01:08:45.871 --> 01:08:47.872
No!

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:50.917
But why didn't he wanna marry me?

01:08:51.710 --> 01:08:54.462
- What's the matter with me?
- Nothing.

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:56.923
- I'm difficult.
- You're challenging.

01:08:57.091 --> 01:09:00.676
- I'm too structured. I'm closed off.
- But in a good way.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:05.098
No, no, no. I drove him away.

01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:09.602
And I'm gonna be 40!

01:09:10.688 --> 01:09:12.188
When?

01:09:12.356 --> 01:09:14.732
- Some day.
- In eight years.

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:20.404
But it's there! It's just sitting there
like this big dead end.

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:26.911
And it's not the same for men. Charlie
Chaplin had babies when he was 73.

01:09:27.078 --> 01:09:29.288
Yeah, but he was too old to pick 'em up.

01:09:35.379 --> 01:09:37.755
Oh, come here. Come here.

01:09:37.923 --> 01:09:39.756
It's gonna be OK.

01:09:39.925 --> 01:09:42.301
It's gonna be fine, you'll see.

01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:46.555
Go ahead. It's not one
of my favorites anyway.

01:09:48.392 --> 01:09:50.894
It's gonna be OK.

01:09:56.817 --> 01:09:58.943
OK?

01:09:59.111 --> 01:10:00.987
OK.

01:10:03.908 --> 01:10:05.033
I'll make some tea.

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:07.702
Harry, could you
hold me a little longer?

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:09.704
Oh, sure.

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:11.539
Oh.

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:18.296
OK?

01:10:50.204 --> 01:10:52.080
Are you comfortable?

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:54.165
Sure.

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:03.007
- D'you want something to drink?
- No, I'm OK.

01:11:04.176 --> 01:11:07.845
I'm going to get up for some water,
so it's really no trouble.

01:11:08.013 --> 01:11:10.098
OK. Water.

01:12:05.487 --> 01:12:10.199
You have all your video tapes
alphabetized and on index cards.

01:12:10.367 --> 01:12:11.743
Thank you.

01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:15.621
- D'you wanna watch something?
- No. Not unless you do.

01:12:16.123 --> 01:12:18.291
No. That's OK.

01:12:32.306 --> 01:12:35.933
- D'you wanna go to sleep?
- OK.

01:13:10.177 --> 01:13:11.386
Where are you going?

01:13:12.679 --> 01:13:15.181
I gotta go.

01:13:16.308 --> 01:13:19.519
Gotta go home, change my clothes
and go to work. And so do you.

01:13:19.686 --> 01:13:23.481
But after work I'd like to take you
out to dinner, if you're free. You free?

01:13:23.649 --> 01:13:26.192
- Yes.
- Fine. I'll call you later.

01:13:26.819 --> 01:13:29.153
- Fine.
- Fine.

01:13:48.215 --> 01:13:50.216
- Yours!
- Hello.

01:13:50.384 --> 01:13:52.635
- Sorry to call so early.
- Are you all right?

01:13:52.803 --> 01:13:56.180
No one I know would call at this hour.

01:13:56.348 --> 01:13:58.349
- No one I know would call.
- It's awful.

01:13:58.517 --> 01:14:00.309
- I need to talk.
- What happened?

01:14:00.477 --> 01:14:02.437
- Harry came over.
- I went to Sally's.

01:14:02.604 --> 01:14:05.314
- I was upset Joe was marrying.
- One thing led to another.

01:14:05.482 --> 01:14:07.650
Before I knew it we were kissing.
Then...

01:14:07.818 --> 01:14:10.069
- ..we did it.
- They did it!

01:14:10.237 --> 01:14:12.238
- That's great!
- We prayed for it.

01:14:12.406 --> 01:14:15.074
- You shoulda done it before.
- We said you should do it.

01:14:15.242 --> 01:14:17.869
- You belong together.
- You killed two birds with one stone.

01:14:18.036 --> 01:14:20.580
- Two wrongs make a right.
- How was it?

01:14:20.747 --> 01:14:22.248
- During part was good...
- Good...

01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:24.417
- then I felt suffocated.
- Then it wasn't.

01:14:24.585 --> 01:14:25.793
- Sorry.
- The worst.

01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:27.295
- I had to go.
- He left.

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:29.130
- I feel bad.
- I'm embarrassed.

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:30.548
- I don't blame you.
- That's horrible.

01:14:30.716 --> 01:14:32.633
- I feel ill.
- I'm catching a cold.

01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:34.427
Look, it didn't work out.

01:14:34.595 --> 01:14:38.055
Never sleep with anyone
when you find out your ex is marrying.

01:14:38.223 --> 01:14:40.057
- Who's talking?
- Is that Jess?

01:14:40.225 --> 01:14:42.727
- It's Jane Fonda on the VCR.
- It's Bryant Gumbel.

01:14:42.895 --> 01:14:44.437
Wanna have breakfast?

01:14:44.605 --> 01:14:46.647
- No, I'm not up to it.
- I feel too awful.

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:48.733
- Good.
- I mean, it's so early.

01:14:48.901 --> 01:14:51.277
- But call me later.
- I'll call you later.

01:14:51.445 --> 01:14:52.653
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.

01:14:52.821 --> 01:14:54.906
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:14:56.116 --> 01:14:58.826
- God!
- I know.

01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:02.997
Tell me I'll never have to be
out there again.

01:15:06.251 --> 01:15:09.170
You will never have
to be out there again.

01:15:12.466 --> 01:15:14.926
I'll just say we made a mistake.

01:15:15.677 --> 01:15:18.513
Sally, it was a mistake.

01:15:20.849 --> 01:15:23.392
I just hope I get to say it first.

01:15:24.269 --> 01:15:26.938
I hope she says it before I do.

01:15:29.816 --> 01:15:31.067
It was a mistake.

01:15:31.235 --> 01:15:33.653
I am so relieved
that you think so, too.

01:15:35.239 --> 01:15:37.406
I'm not saying last night wasn't great.

01:15:38.283 --> 01:15:41.285
- It was!
- Yes, it was!

01:15:42.287 --> 01:15:45.831
- We just never should have done it.
- I couldn't agree more.

01:15:46.166 --> 01:15:49.335
- I am so relieved!
- Great.

01:15:49.503 --> 01:15:52.213
Yeah.

01:15:53.799 --> 01:15:55.883
Two mixed green salads.

01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:30.334
It is so nice when you can sit
with someone and not have to talk.

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:36.716
Most of the time,
you go to bed with someone...

01:16:36.883 --> 01:16:40.928
then she tells you all her stories,
you tell her all your stories.

01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:44.849
But with Sally and me,
we'd already heard each other's stories.

01:16:45.017 --> 01:16:49.020
So once we went to bed, we didn't know
what we were supposed to do. You know?

01:16:49.187 --> 01:16:51.439
Sure, Harry.

01:16:52.065 --> 01:16:53.733
I don't know.

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:55.610
Maybe you get to a point
in a relationship

01:16:55.777 --> 01:16:59.530
where it's too late
to have sex. You know?

01:17:09.082 --> 01:17:11.500
Is Harry bringing anyone to the wedding?

01:17:11.668 --> 01:17:13.711
I don't think so.

01:17:15.047 --> 01:17:16.422
Is he seeing anyone?

01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:20.635
He was seeing
this anthropologist, but...

01:17:21.511 --> 01:17:25.723
- What does she look like?
- Thin, pretty, big tits.

01:17:25.891 --> 01:17:27.475
Your basic nightmare.

01:17:32.105 --> 01:17:33.564
What d'ya think?

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:37.693
Oh, Marie...

01:17:38.403 --> 01:17:40.237
Tell the truth.

01:17:41.698 --> 01:17:44.200
It's just beautiful.

01:18:15.774 --> 01:18:21.612
We are gathered here today to celebrate
the marriage of Marie and Jess.

01:18:22.322 --> 01:18:25.491
And to consecrate
their vows of matrimony.

01:18:25.659 --> 01:18:29.120
The vows they will take
join their lives.

01:18:29.287 --> 01:18:34.375
The wine they will share
binds all their hopes together.

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:36.836
And by the rings they will wear...

01:18:37.003 --> 01:18:41.966
they will be known to all
as husband and wife.

01:18:52.352 --> 01:18:55.980
I've never seen her so happy.
She's a different person.

01:18:56.148 --> 01:19:00.860
Oh, yeah, she is. It's great,
but what're we gonna do about you?

01:19:01.027 --> 01:19:03.404
- Me?
- Hon, you wanna dance?

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:06.073
- Oh, yeah! Yeah, I do.
- Excuse us.

01:19:09.494 --> 01:19:12.204
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:19:15.834 --> 01:19:19.003
- Nice ceremony.
- Beautiful.

01:19:21.298 --> 01:19:22.798
Boy, the holidays are rough!

01:19:22.966 --> 01:19:26.761
Every year I try to get from
Thanksgiving to New Year.

01:19:26.928 --> 01:19:29.513
A lot of suicides.

01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:33.559
- Would you like a pea pod with shrimp?
- Thank you.

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:37.521
- How've you been?
- Fine.

01:19:37.689 --> 01:19:39.273
- Seeing anybody?
- Harry.

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:41.192
- What?
- I don't wanna talk about this.

01:19:41.359 --> 01:19:44.695
- Why not?
- I don't want to talk about it.

01:19:45.322 --> 01:19:49.533
Why can't we get past this? Are we
gonna carry this thing around for ever?

01:19:49.701 --> 01:19:54.038
- Forever? It just happened!
- It happened three weeks ago.

01:19:54.206 --> 01:19:57.124
You know how a year to a person
is like seven years to a dog?

01:19:58.293 --> 01:20:00.127
Yes!

01:20:02.297 --> 01:20:05.299
Is one of us supposed to be a dog
in this scenario?

01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:07.927
- Yes.
- Who is the dog?

01:20:08.094 --> 01:20:11.388
- You are.
- I am! I am the dog!

01:20:11.556 --> 01:20:14.016
I am the dog! I...

01:20:20.023 --> 01:20:22.691
I don't see that. You are the dog.

01:20:22.859 --> 01:20:25.069
You act like what happened
didn't mean anything.

01:20:25.237 --> 01:20:28.405
No, I don't, but why
does it have to mean everything?

01:20:28.573 --> 01:20:29.907
Because it does!

01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:33.911
You know it better than anyone,
'cause after it happens you walk out!

01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:37.039
- I didn't walk out.
- Sprinted is more like it.

01:20:37.207 --> 01:20:40.626
- We both agreed it was a mistake.
- The worst mistake I ever made!

01:20:42.462 --> 01:20:44.338
- What do you want from me?
- Nothing!

01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:46.632
Fine! But let's just
get one thing straight.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:50.427
I did not go over there
to make love to you.

01:20:50.595 --> 01:20:54.598
But you looked at me with these weepy
eyes: "Don't go home. Hold me, Harry."

01:20:54.766 --> 01:20:58.602
- What was I supposed to do?
- Are you saying you took pity on me?

01:20:58.770 --> 01:21:00.855
- No! I was...
- Fuck you!

01:21:04.901 --> 01:21:08.028
Everybody, could I have
your attention, please?

remotely attractive...

Hi, it's me. It's the holiday season...

01:22:11.509 --> 01:22:14.970
and I thought I'd remind you
that it's the season of forgiveness.

01:22:15.138 --> 01:22:19.725
And, although it's not widely known,
it is also the season of groveling.

01:22:19.893 --> 01:22:22.394
So, if you felt like calling me back...

01:22:22.562 --> 01:22:26.774

Home, desperately wanna talk to me,

If it's either A or C,

You got Dick Clark. That's tradition.

You got Mallomars,
the greatest cookie of all time.

01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:05.265
And you're about to give the Knicks
their first championship since 1973.

I don't know why
I let you drag me to this.

This is much better. Fresh air,
I have the streets all to myself.

01:25:34.337 --> 01:25:38.048
Who needs to be at a big, crowded party,
pretending to have a good time?

01:25:38.216 --> 01:25:41.927
Plus, this is the perfect time
to catch up on my window-shopping.

This is good.

01:25:55.733 --> 01:25:58.902

You realize that
we could never be friends.

01:26:44.616 --> 01:26:46.909
- Why not?
- What I'm saying is...

01:26:47.076 --> 01:26:48.327
men and women can't be friends,

01:26:48.494 --> 01:26:50.662
'cause the sex part
always gets in the way.

01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:52.206
That's not true!

01:26:52.373 --> 01:26:54.958
No man can be friends
with a woman he finds attractive.

01:26:55.126 --> 01:26:59.129
- He always wants to have sex with her.
- What if they don't wanna have sex?

01:26:59.297 --> 01:27:02.966
Doesn't matter. The sex thing is already
out there, so the friendship is doomed.

01:27:03.134 --> 01:27:05.636
And that is the end of the story.

01:27:05.803 --> 01:27:07.679

"Should auld acquaintance be forgot" -
should we forget old acquaintances?

01:30:56.367 --> 01:30:58.618
Or if we forget them,
should we remember them?

01:30:58.786 --> 01:31:01.037
Which is not possible
'cause we already forgot 'em!

01:31:01.205 --> 01:31:06.460
Maybe it just means we should remember
that we forgot them, or something.

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:11.923
Anyway, it's about old friends.

01:31:18.639 --> 01:31:21.141
The first time we met
we hated each other.

01:31:21.309 --> 01:31:26.104
No, I hated you. The second time
we met, you didn't even remember me.

01:31:26.272 --> 01:31:28.565
I did, too! I remembered you.

01:31:28.733 --> 01:31:31.234

we became friends.

We were friends

- We had a really wonderful wedding.
- It really was... a beautiful wedding.

01:31:48.085 --> 01:31:52.297
- We had this enormous coconut cake.
- Huge coconut cake with the tiers.

01:31:52.465 --> 01:31:55.467
And there was this very rich
chocolate sauce on the side.

01:31:55.635 --> 01:31:59.054
Right. 'Cause not everybody likes it
on the cake 'cause it makes it soggy.

01:31:59.222 --> 01:32:02.432
Particularly, the coconut soaks up
a lot, so it's important

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:03.767
