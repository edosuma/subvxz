09:46.934 --> 09:49.414
See, I knew you were gonna run
that ball even before the snap.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.503
I didn't know before the snap.

09:51.547 --> 09:53.027
Sure, you did.

09:53.070 --> 09:55.595
You were eying the back right
corner of that end zone.

09:55.638 --> 09:57.640
It's subtle, but you have a tell

09:57.684 --> 09:59.076
when you're
holding something back.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.687
You were doing it
way back in high school,

10:00.730 --> 10:02.036
and you did it just now.

10:02.079 --> 10:04.604
What aren't you saying?

10:08.825 --> 10:10.914
You went to Crenshaw,

10:10.958 --> 10:13.438
so you know
how the old neighborhood works.

10:13.482 --> 10:15.353
You rise up out of there,

10:15.397 --> 10:17.007
everybody you ever knew
has got their hand out,

10:17.051 --> 10:18.661
thinks you owe them
something.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.054
I never bit.

10:20.097 --> 10:22.534
You give into one,
next day a dozen show up.

10:22.578 --> 10:23.840
It's like feeding cats.

10:23.884 --> 10:25.407

jealous or angry enough

10:25.450 --> 10:27.409
to want to take you out?NICHOLS:
I didn't.

10:27.452 --> 10:30.673
But now, who knows?

10:30.717 --> 10:32.066
They were my biggest fans.

10:32.109 --> 10:34.764
Now most of my hate mail
comes from my old zip code.

10:34.808 --> 10:36.505
You save any of
these letters?

10:36.548 --> 10:37.549
[scoffs]

10:37.593 --> 10:38.855
How about you, Carolyn?

10:38.899 --> 10:40.596
Do you hang on to any
of this hate mail?

10:40.640 --> 10:42.685
I just stuff them in a box.

10:42.729 --> 10:45.862
I don't want any of these people
to get in trouble.

10:45.906 --> 10:47.734
I'm sure most of them
were just letting off

10:47.777 --> 10:48.909
some steam,
but some of it's...

10:50.650 --> 10:51.912
It's awful.

10:51.955 --> 10:52.956
How so?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.393
They say Derrick's
a sellout.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.962
Say how they're gonna hurt him.
Hurt me.

10:59.006 --> 11:00.398
Burn our house down.

11:00.442 --> 11:02.792
I thought it would
stop when he retired,

11:02.836 --> 11:05.447
but some people just want
to tear down achievers.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.884
Would you mind turning
over this mail to us?

11:09.407 --> 11:11.409
NICHOLS:
That's my girl.

11:11.453 --> 11:12.933
Asked her out
sophomore year of college

11:12.976 --> 11:14.151
and never looked back.

11:16.414 --> 11:17.807
We about done here, guys?

11:17.851 --> 11:19.461
I got some commitments
I need to get to.

11:19.504 --> 11:21.506
Actually, we were gonna ask
both of you to come with us

11:21.550 --> 11:23.117
to enter protective custody
until things cool down.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.119
Sorry. I don't think so.

11:25.162 --> 11:26.903
Are you opposed to
a security detail?

11:26.947 --> 11:28.557
Free bodyguards? Sure.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.515
Just have them
meet me out front.

11:30.559 --> 11:32.648
Thanks for
everything, guys.

11:36.565 --> 11:37.740
All right,
I'm gonna talk to Sanchez

11:37.784 --> 11:39.481

can hang back.

get out of your sight.Roger that.

11:56.019 --> 11:57.717

11:57.760 --> 11:59.849
that call you answered earlier.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.851
You seemed pretty shook.
Does it have anything to do

12:01.895 --> 12:03.853
with the commission
coming after Hondo?[exhales]

12:03.897 --> 12:05.550
Well,
that's a whole separate problem.

12:05.594 --> 12:06.638
No, it's got nothing

12:06.682 --> 12:08.989
to do with that.Okay. Just checking.

12:10.033 --> 12:11.818
The call...

12:13.689 --> 12:15.735
It was, um...

12:15.778 --> 12:17.824
about an old Jane Doe case

12:17.867 --> 12:20.914
I never really quite cracked.

12:20.957 --> 12:23.481
Is it one I know?No, it was
my pre-SWAT days.

12:23.525 --> 12:26.180
I was still working Homicide.
Come here.

12:29.574 --> 12:31.838
It's been 20 years now,
believe it or not.

12:31.881 --> 12:34.057
We found her body
in the brush off Route 27.

12:34.101 --> 12:36.538
Poor girl was barely more

12:36.581 --> 12:38.018
than a kid.

12:38.061 --> 12:40.237
Newspapers dubbed her
Highway Jane.

12:40.281 --> 12:41.935
It says she died
of strangulation?Yeah.

12:41.978 --> 12:44.546
I caught her killer
a month later.

12:44.589 --> 12:46.722
Interviewed him
more times than I care to count,

12:46.766 --> 12:48.680
but he never told us
who she was.

12:48.724 --> 12:51.161
To be honest,
I don't even believe he knew.

12:51.205 --> 12:53.816
So, I waited for someone
to show up and claim her body,

12:53.860 --> 12:55.122
but no one ever did.

12:55.165 --> 12:58.081
We buried her
in an unmarked grave.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.779
Can't imagine the pain.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.476
Yeah, it's kept me up

13:01.519 --> 13:02.825
for nights for 20 years,

13:02.869 --> 13:06.176
not being able to help out
whoever her family was.

13:06.220 --> 13:09.049
I reach out to the coroner's
office a few times a year,

13:09.092 --> 13:11.529
check the status
on the case.

13:11.573 --> 13:14.532
Is that the call you got?
The coroner?Yeah. Apparently,

13:14.576 --> 13:17.057
they ran her DNA through
one of those ancestry databases

13:17.100 --> 13:18.232
everyone's using.

13:18.275 --> 13:20.103
Think they've identified
a first cousin.

13:20.147 --> 13:22.540
They track down this cousin yet?Well,

13:22.584 --> 13:23.933
I've been trying, but the phone
just keeps ringing,

13:23.977 --> 13:27.894
so who knows
how old the contact info is.Huh.

13:27.937 --> 13:31.636
Well, if only we knew somebody
that had the equipment

13:31.680 --> 13:35.205
or resources to pull an address.

13:35.249 --> 13:37.773
Any luck sourcing the 911 call?STREET:
Nope.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.122
But we know it was
placed from a burner,

13:39.166 --> 13:40.820
just like the one
that sent Nichols

13:40.863 --> 13:41.864
a death threat.Same phone?

13:41.908 --> 13:42.909
Yeah.

13:42.952 --> 13:44.127
Whoever swatted Nichols,

13:44.171 --> 13:45.955
they covered their tracks,
but I'm not sure

13:45.999 --> 13:47.565
they're the most sophisticated.

Hi. Justin Wolf.
Derrick Nichols' manager.

14:10.719 --> 14:11.938
I'd like to speak
to whoever's in charge here.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.983
That'd be me.

14:14.027 --> 14:15.855
What can I do for you, Mr. Wolf?

14:15.898 --> 14:16.943
The, uh, people after my client.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.292
How close are you
to catching them?

14:18.335 --> 14:20.033
Mr. Nichols send you here?

14:20.076 --> 14:21.295
No, not explicitly,

14:21.338 --> 14:23.210
but Derrick
pays me three percent.

14:23.253 --> 14:25.865
He knows that means
I keep an eye on things for him.

14:25.908 --> 14:28.258
For three percent of his pay,
you better do more than that.

14:28.302 --> 14:30.260
Believe me, I do.

14:30.304 --> 14:32.262
Derrick pays me three percent
to make sure he stays rich

14:32.306 --> 14:35.048
off the other 97%.Having a marquee quarterback
for a client,

14:35.091 --> 14:36.876
that's got to open
some doors, too, right?

14:36.919 --> 14:38.181
Doesn't hurt,
but I'm the one that pushed him

14:38.225 --> 14:39.879
to license his name
ten years back.

14:39.922 --> 14:40.923
And between that
and the real estate,

14:40.967 --> 14:41.968

Dips got greedy,

destroying a marriage, huh?

19:07.189 --> 19:09.278
Son of a bitch
screwed my wife.

19:09.322 --> 19:12.281

assaulted me first.

19:12.325 --> 19:14.327
I was on his O-line
for five years.

19:14.370 --> 19:16.024

half my career protecting
his ass, and this

19:18.461 --> 19:20.681
is how he repays me?

Well, 20 years ago,

20:48.899 --> 20:51.075
a young woman was murdered,
and she was never identified.

20:51.119 --> 20:54.818
Recently, they put her DNA
into a family tree database

20:54.862 --> 20:57.778

to just one relative.

may have dropped off the grid,

looked like this.

I had any cousins.

Mm.Mom never talked about him.

21:40.429 --> 21:42.518
I tried to get her to open up
before she died,

21:42.562 --> 21:44.172

much of a fan.

21:44.215 --> 21:45.608

21:45.652 --> 21:48.002
I got from that side
was a few birthday cards.

are exactly the people
that I meant.

there's other women?

22:26.388 --> 22:28.564

you do more listening

than you do talking.

My life's a lie.

23:03.077 --> 23:04.557

the money, the women...

23:08.299 --> 23:10.432
I'm a weak man.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.653
Maybe all this

23:13.696 --> 23:16.395
is just the chickens
coming home to roost.

You can't change the past, man.

Technology
keeps getting better.

23:38.329 --> 23:40.984

get their names back every day.

23:41.028 --> 23:42.333
You just got
to give it time.

23:42.377 --> 23:45.249
If time were the answer,
she'd have her name.

23:45.293 --> 23:47.426
Her parents would know
what happened to her.

23:47.469 --> 23:49.210
They could at least visit
her grave.

23:55.608 --> 23:57.436
When you were
working Homicide,

23:57.479 --> 24:00.482
I'm guessing Highway Jane
wasn't the only Doe file

24:00.526 --> 24:01.744
that you couldn't close.

24:01.788 --> 24:04.443
What is it about this case?

24:09.273 --> 24:12.320
You know, I always said that
Barb and the kids were my life,

24:12.363 --> 24:16.411
but I'm, I'm not sure that
was true early in my career.

24:16.455 --> 24:19.588
I wanted Detective so bad,
I'd bring every case home;

24:19.632 --> 24:22.373
I hardly saw JP or Molly.

24:22.417 --> 24:24.550
Finding a-a young girl,
that must've really hit home.

24:24.593 --> 24:26.682
Always does.

24:26.726 --> 24:29.337
But that's not why
this stuck in my craw.

24:29.380 --> 24:32.209
Late one night, Molly came
across the case file on my desk.

24:32.253 --> 24:34.037
[sighs]

24:34.081 --> 24:35.386
What'd she see?

24:35.430 --> 24:38.172
Crime scene photo...
or enough of one.

24:42.132 --> 24:43.612
I used to look out my window

24:43.656 --> 24:45.396
and record myself,

24:45.440 --> 24:48.574
then I'd play back
every fact, every detail.

24:48.617 --> 24:51.490
That's how I worked
my way through a case back then.

24:51.533 --> 24:54.144
But one night,

24:54.188 --> 24:56.320
I turned around,

24:56.364 --> 24:58.322
and Molly was there.

24:58.366 --> 25:00.324
Curled up in a corner.

25:00.368 --> 25:02.065
She couldn't have been there
more than ten seconds

25:02.109 --> 25:03.676
when I realized...

25:03.719 --> 25:05.416
she saw the photo on my desk.

25:05.460 --> 25:08.463
So I threw this thing down
and I ran over to her.

25:09.725 --> 25:11.727
And I, uh...

25:13.729 --> 25:15.644
I had to explain
to my little girl

25:15.688 --> 25:18.647
that the world can be
a dangerous place.

25:18.691 --> 25:21.563
You seem to remember it
all pretty clearly.

25:21.607 --> 25:24.218
I can't forget it.

25:24.261 --> 25:26.263
And then when
she calmed down,

25:26.307 --> 25:28.265
you know, the questions
started-- who's...

25:28.309 --> 25:29.658
out looking for the girl?

25:29.702 --> 25:31.399
Where are her parents, you know?

25:31.442 --> 25:34.533
She asked me to promise that I
would find Jane Doe's real name.

25:34.576 --> 25:38.493
And promise I'd bring her back
to her mom and dad, so...

25:38.537 --> 25:40.364
[chuckles]

25:40.408 --> 25:42.149
...I promised.

25:42.192 --> 25:44.064
I swore it.

25:44.107 --> 25:46.196
You did what was best
for your kid at the time.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.242
It's all you can do.

25:48.285 --> 25:50.810
Yeah, months went by,

25:50.853 --> 25:54.074
and eventually Molly stopped
asking about the case, but...

25:54.117 --> 25:56.729
she never looked
at me the same way again.

25:58.426 --> 26:01.168
At least that's how it felt.

26:02.212 --> 26:04.388
I've seen you two together.

26:04.432 --> 26:06.216
Molly adores you.

26:06.260 --> 26:07.566
No... I-I know.

26:07.609 --> 26:09.263
I-I know she loves me.

26:09.306 --> 26:11.091
It's not that.

26:11.134 --> 26:13.615
I think it made her sad
to find out her dad was

26:13.659 --> 26:16.139
a guy who made promises
that he couldn't keep.

26:16.183 --> 26:18.446
So from then on,
every case I got,

26:18.489 --> 26:21.144
it was a reminder of that piece
of our relationship

26:21.188 --> 26:23.233
my job took away.

26:27.890 --> 26:30.632
When someone puts time and
money into attempted murder,

26:30.676 --> 26:32.460
they're what we call
a persistent threat.

26:32.503 --> 26:34.288
Whoever's after Derrick,
you sure they'll try again?

26:34.331 --> 26:35.811
Well, you sure they won't?

26:35.855 --> 26:37.421
I spoke to the newsroom manager
at Bad Behavior.

26:37.465 --> 26:39.728
She won't give up the source
of the Nichols affair.

26:39.772 --> 26:41.556
Did you tell her
someone's life is at stake?I did.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.253
I pushed as hard as I could.

26:43.297 --> 26:44.733
Call her back.
Ask her if she wants to report

26:44.777 --> 26:46.387
the news
or she wants to be the news.

26:46.430 --> 26:48.607
Here's what you asked for,
Sanchez.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.347
Nichols' latest statement.Great.

26:50.391 --> 26:52.393
All right, I want to go
over this with Nichols.

26:52.436 --> 26:54.569
Where is he?I saw him

26:54.613 --> 26:56.484
in that corner on the phone,
but that was a while ago.

26:56.527 --> 26:58.660
Carolyn left him a voice mail.
He was calling her back.

26:58.704 --> 27:00.749
He wouldn't have left
without me.

27:03.796 --> 27:05.667
This is Derrick,
leave a message.

27:05.711 --> 27:08.191
Straight to voice mail.

27:08.235 --> 27:09.845
Maybe he wanted to speak
to Carolyn face to face.

27:09.889 --> 27:11.804
You think he took off?HONDO:
I really hope not.

27:11.847 --> 27:13.893
His guard's down, and somebody
out there is after him.

27:13.936 --> 27:15.677
I wonder what Carolyn said
in the message?

27:15.721 --> 27:16.765
What are you doing?

27:16.809 --> 27:18.158
A few of my clients
gave me access

27:18.201 --> 27:19.333
to their passcodes just in case

27:19.376 --> 27:21.291
they get locked out
of their accounts.

27:21.335 --> 27:22.771
Here.

27:22.815 --> 27:24.730

37:51.007 --> 37:55.316
And turns out, there was a faint
imprint from a pen on the back

37:55.360 --> 37:57.405
with the sender's address.

37:57.449 --> 37:59.320
Barely make out the name.

37:59.364 --> 38:01.975
Braun-- do we have contact
information for her family?

38:02.018 --> 38:03.455
There is no family.

38:03.498 --> 38:05.587
Her father died
a few years ago.

38:05.631 --> 38:08.286
Her mother passed away
when she was young.

38:09.330 --> 38:12.246
Kimberly was their only child.

38:14.596 --> 38:16.294
So all those years I obsessed

38:16.337 --> 38:18.034
about what her parents
were going through.

38:18.078 --> 38:19.297
They're gone.

38:19.340 --> 38:20.733
There's no one to tell.

38:20.776 --> 38:22.430
Bob...

38:22.474 --> 38:24.519
you can stand down.

38:26.347 --> 38:27.740
[chuckles softly]

38:27.783 --> 38:29.307
Whoa.

38:29.350 --> 38:31.091
That's her.

38:31.134 --> 38:33.093
Kimberly Braun.

38:34.137 --> 38:35.400
[smacks lips]

38:44.278 --> 38:46.498
Nichols.

38:46.541 --> 38:49.196
I respect what you did today.

38:49.239 --> 38:51.416
Before you knew the
truth about Carolyn.

38:51.459 --> 38:53.635
Running into danger.
It wasn't smart,

38:53.679 --> 38:55.071
but it was heroic.

38:55.115 --> 38:56.508
Not football hero.

38:56.551 --> 38:58.074
Real hero.

39:00.294 --> 39:02.165
I hated you guys.

39:02.209 --> 39:04.864
You know... Crenshaw.

39:06.126 --> 39:08.650
Y'all beat us three out
of my four years in high school.

39:08.694 --> 39:10.435
[chuckles]

39:10.478 --> 39:12.437
Yeah, we didn't think
much of Dorsey, either.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.308
You play?Mm-hmm.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.266
College?Thought about it.

39:16.310 --> 39:18.225
Joined the Marines instead.

39:18.268 --> 39:20.358
You ever regret
not going for it?

39:20.401 --> 39:22.621
My daddy's dream was
to watch me play at Grambling.

39:22.664 --> 39:25.101
But I was stubborn.

39:25.145 --> 39:26.712
So you chose to do the opposite.

39:26.755 --> 39:28.496
Something like that.

39:28.540 --> 39:31.325
I was good, though-- maybe not
a five star recruit like you,

39:31.369 --> 39:33.371
and I probably wasn't
gonna go pro.

39:33.414 --> 39:34.763
But you never know.

39:34.807 --> 39:36.722
I ain't gonna lie.

39:36.765 --> 39:38.680
Can't help but wonder sometimes.

39:38.724 --> 39:41.335
You know what I always
wanted to be?

39:41.379 --> 39:42.858
Hmm?

39:42.902 --> 39:44.294
A cop.

39:44.338 --> 39:45.774
[chuckles]
I guess nobody told you

39:45.818 --> 39:48.124
what they pay cops.[both laugh]

39:49.604 --> 39:51.476
Hey.

39:51.519 --> 39:53.129
Good luck with everything, man.

39:53.173 --> 39:54.479
Thank you, man, appreciate it.

39:54.522 --> 39:56.524
All right.
Stay up.

39:59.484 --> 40:02.356
Aw, second-guessing me

40:02.400 --> 40:04.271
in front of the team?

40:04.314 --> 40:05.751
Textbook
insubordination.

40:05.794 --> 40:07.317
Give me a break, Sanchez.

40:07.361 --> 40:08.841
I was just passing
along what I was seeing.

40:08.884 --> 40:10.886
You're making this easy,
Hondo.

40:10.930 --> 40:13.454
Strike two.

40:13.498 --> 40:14.629
One more, and you're looking

40:14.673 --> 40:16.588
at a mandatory
disciplinary hearing.

40:16.631 --> 40:18.503
Just remember...

40:18.546 --> 40:20.461
you wanted to do this
the hard way.

40:27.599 --> 40:29.905
MOLLY:
You're gonna help her, right?

40:29.949 --> 40:31.864
HICKS: I'm going to do
everything I can.

40:31.907 --> 40:34.606
MOLLY: No, promise me
you'll help her, Dad.

40:34.649 --> 40:37.435
HICKS: Molly, I swear it,
I'll help her.

40:37.478 --> 40:39.915
MOLLY:
What grade was she in?

40:39.959 --> 40:42.744
HICKS:
I... I don't know, sweetie.

40:42.788 --> 40:45.399
But I do know she's in heaven.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.880
I know her friends are there,
maybe her grandparents,

40:47.923 --> 40:50.360
her dog,

40:50.404 --> 40:52.275
and toys to play with.

40:52.319 --> 40:54.495
Okay, honey? Come here.

40:57.237 --> 40:58.586
[clicks]

41:08.988 --> 41:10.598
That's why Sanchez

41:10.642 --> 41:13.296
took this job--
to get Hondo to quit.

41:13.340 --> 41:14.733
That's awful.

41:15.908 --> 41:17.518
We got to do something.

41:17.562 --> 41:18.911
What's in this for Sanchez?

41:18.954 --> 41:20.478
Your guess is as good as ours.

41:20.521 --> 41:21.522
How's Hondo holding up anyway?

41:21.566 --> 41:23.481
He's hanging in there.

41:24.699 --> 41:27.354
I take it you
filled them in?

41:28.703 --> 41:30.444
Sorry. We-we-we had no idea.

41:32.359 --> 41:33.795
What can we do to help?

41:33.839 --> 41:35.797
I don't know what we can do.

41:35.841 --> 41:37.538
Besides wait him out.

41:37.582 --> 41:39.453
I'm done waiting, man.Yeah, so am I.

41:39.497 --> 41:40.802
You've done so much
for all of us.

41:40.846 --> 41:42.412
It's time for us
to return the favor.

41:42.456 --> 41:43.588
You don't need to face this
on your own.

41:44.937 --> 41:46.504
So we're in agreement then.

41:47.809 --> 41:50.551
We solve this problem...

41:50.595 --> 41:52.422
once and for all.
