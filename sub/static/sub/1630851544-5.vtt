Previously onSWAT...20-Squad's been reinstated.

00:04.047 --> 00:05.005
DEACON:
Who's team leader?

00:05.048 --> 00:06.049
I'm your new 20-David.

00:06.093 --> 00:07.485
Rodrigo Sanchez.

00:07.529 --> 00:09.009
I'm SWAT OG from
before your time,

00:09.052 --> 00:10.662
and I worked with
Hondo, Deacon, Luca.

00:10.706 --> 00:12.621
They were all my brothers.

00:12.664 --> 00:14.057
I look forward to
making you family, too.

00:14.101 --> 00:16.103
You good with this?It is what it is.

00:16.146 --> 00:17.887
LUCA:
There's no way
a guy like Sanchez

00:17.930 --> 00:19.671
comes back here
without an agenda.

00:19.715 --> 00:21.369
Let's just wait
and see what happens.

00:21.412 --> 00:22.631
Rodrigo Sanchez.

00:22.674 --> 00:24.154
They sent him
to get you to quit.

00:24.198 --> 00:26.504
It's his one and only job there.

00:26.548 --> 00:27.723
Sanchez is in on this?

00:27.766 --> 00:29.072
RENEE: I overheard
him telling my boss

00:29.116 --> 00:30.856
that it wouldn't
take him long to get rid of you.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.075
I know about your orders
with the commission.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.859
I'm glad this is
all out in the open now.

00:33.903 --> 00:36.036
What the hell is going on here?SANCHEZ:
All it's gonna take

00:36.079 --> 00:37.646
is one minor screwup
to give the commission

00:37.689 --> 00:39.517
what it wants
to send you packing.

00:39.561 --> 00:40.953
So have some dignity

00:40.997 --> 00:43.173
and just walk away first.

00:45.088 --> 00:47.699
DISPATCHER: Please state
the nature of your emergency.MAN: We need help.

00:47.743 --> 00:49.701
Some guy broke into our house
with a gun.

00:49.745 --> 00:50.920
He's shooting.

00:50.963 --> 00:52.617
5814 La Goleta.

00:52.661 --> 00:54.097
DISPATCHER:
Police are on the way, sir.

00:54.141 --> 00:55.533
Is anyone in the home injured?

00:55.577 --> 00:57.405
MAN:
My parents. I heard screams.

00:57.448 --> 00:58.884
Then gunfire.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.103
Oh, God.DISPATCHER:
Is the man

01:00.147 --> 01:01.713
still inside the house?MAN:
Yeah.

01:01.757 --> 01:04.629
I think he's high on something.
Oh! Oh, no. Oh, no.

01:04.673 --> 01:06.588
He's coming. He's coming! [line disconnects]

01:06.631 --> 01:07.980
DISPATCHER:
Hello?

01:08.024 --> 01:09.547
Sir, are you there?

01:09.591 --> 01:11.071
LUCA: This place
is freaky quiet.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.768
TAN:
Maybe the suspect
already bolted.

01:12.811 --> 01:14.465
Hold.

01:18.600 --> 01:19.775
He's inside.

01:19.818 --> 01:22.082
We're being watched. Sanchez,

01:22.125 --> 01:23.822
I think the suspect
might be expecting us.

01:23.866 --> 01:25.259
SANCHEZ:
Roger that.

01:25.302 --> 01:27.217
Remember, everyone, we got
three possible victims.

01:27.261 --> 01:28.740
Tan, take point.

01:28.784 --> 01:30.916
SANCHEZ: Stay sharp
and don't give up positions.

01:48.499 --> 01:50.762
Shots fired from inside.

01:50.806 --> 01:52.112
Deacon, emergency entry.

01:53.287 --> 01:54.766
HONDO:
Tan, moving.

02:00.816 --> 02:02.644
SANCHEZ:
20-David. There's blood
in the kitchen.

02:03.732 --> 02:05.473
No sign of the victim.

02:05.516 --> 02:08.215
27-David. Repeat.DEACON:
30-David.

02:08.258 --> 02:09.694
There was a struggle
in the kitchen.

02:09.738 --> 02:12.132
Suspect may have a gun
and a knife.

02:12.175 --> 02:13.263
Move.

02:14.264 --> 02:16.484
TAN:
Clear.

02:16.527 --> 02:18.486
Clear.

02:18.529 --> 02:19.965
Looks like they

02:20.009 --> 02:21.619
just moved in.
Some kind of remodel.

02:29.584 --> 02:31.890
LAPD! Drop that weapon!CHRIS:
Hands up now!

02:31.934 --> 02:33.675
STREET:
Drop it!

02:33.718 --> 02:34.850
What the hell?

02:35.677 --> 02:37.505
That's a cardboard cutout.

02:37.548 --> 02:38.549
Moving.

02:38.593 --> 02:40.160
Street.

02:42.901 --> 02:44.773
26-David. Suspect is using

02:44.816 --> 02:46.862
a 12-gauge.
Let's move.

02:53.216 --> 02:56.219
Hondo. Any sign
of the residents?Not yet.

02:56.263 --> 02:58.178
Suspect may be forcing
them to hunker down.

02:58.221 --> 03:00.092
House like this, it
might have a safe room.

03:00.136 --> 03:02.834
The gunman could be in there
with them.SANCHEZ: What a nightmare.

03:02.878 --> 03:05.228
20-Squad, be advised. We got
a possible hostage situation

03:05.272 --> 03:06.882
inside a fortified safe room.LUCA:
Roger that.

03:06.925 --> 03:08.144
Nothing in here.

03:29.121 --> 03:31.167
It's clear.Hondo.

03:33.256 --> 03:35.345
SANCHEZ:
20-David in.

03:35.389 --> 03:37.695
Safe room's got to have
its own power source.

03:37.739 --> 03:38.914
Bet it's in here.

03:46.704 --> 03:49.620
[door clangs]Thing's reinforced.

03:49.664 --> 03:52.101
It's high-tech.27-David.

03:52.144 --> 03:54.321
There is a safe room
in the master suite.

03:54.364 --> 03:55.931
Someone inside
could be bleeding out.

03:55.974 --> 03:57.280
We got to find a way
to override the system.

03:57.324 --> 03:58.977
We're looking, Hondo.

03:59.021 --> 04:00.022
[circuit breaker door opens]

04:02.067 --> 04:03.155
NICHOLS:
You try coming in here,

04:03.199 --> 04:05.114
I'll rain down holy hell on you!

04:05.157 --> 04:06.898
Drop your weapon!LAPD! Open the door!

04:06.942 --> 04:08.335
Who's in there with you?NICHOLS:I got

04:08.378 --> 04:10.075
enough bullets in here
to kill everybody!

04:10.119 --> 04:11.947
Get the hell out!30-David.

04:11.990 --> 04:13.078
Luca.LUCA:
Go.

04:13.122 --> 04:14.254
If we don't get
this door open ASAP,

04:14.297 --> 04:16.256
we're looking
at a triple homicide.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.084
Look, he found the power.
Keep him talking.

04:19.128 --> 04:20.782
Hey, man, what do you want?

04:20.825 --> 04:22.000
NICHOLS:
Is that a brother?

04:22.044 --> 04:23.175
Man, how you gonna do me
like this?

04:23.219 --> 04:24.612
You're the one
who shot at me.

04:24.655 --> 04:25.961
NICHOLS:
Next time, I won't miss.

04:26.004 --> 04:27.092
Don't be stupid!

04:27.136 --> 04:28.137
What's your name?

04:28.180 --> 04:29.747
NICHOLS:
You know my damn name.

04:35.362 --> 04:38.800
Are you Derrick Nichols,
the quarterback?

04:38.843 --> 04:40.280
Luca, try this.

04:49.158 --> 04:51.116
NICHOLS:
This door opens,
you're a dead man!

04:51.160 --> 04:52.683
Okay, hey, hey.

04:52.727 --> 04:53.945
Listen to me.

04:53.989 --> 04:56.078
I'm Sergeant Harrelson
with the LAPD.

04:56.121 --> 04:57.209
Someone called to report

04:57.253 --> 04:58.689
an armed intruder
at this residence.

04:58.733 --> 05:00.169
Did you make that call?NICHOLS:
No!

05:00.212 --> 05:01.823
We didn't call the police.

05:03.172 --> 05:05.130
All right, Derrick,
we're gonna open the door.

05:05.174 --> 05:06.654
Don't be stupid.
Put the gun on the ground.

05:06.697 --> 05:07.959
We don't want to hurt you.

05:08.003 --> 05:10.135
All right. Three.Here we come!

05:10.179 --> 05:12.007
Two. One.

05:13.269 --> 05:14.314
HONDO:
Need you to step out.

05:16.490 --> 05:18.318
Is there anyone else
in there with you?

05:19.275 --> 05:21.016
NICHOLS:
Don't. Whoa, whoa, whoa.Show me your hands!

05:21.059 --> 05:22.713
Whoa, whoa!Show me your hands!
Come out very slowly.

05:22.757 --> 05:24.976
Don't shoot! Don't shoot.
Carolyn, it's okay.

05:25.020 --> 05:27.414
Come on out. They're cops.[breathing shakily]
I'm his wife.

05:27.457 --> 05:29.111
NICHOLS:
It's okay.CAROLYN: I'm his wife.

05:29.154 --> 05:31.374
Is there anyone
else in the house?No.

05:33.071 --> 05:34.159
All right, come on out.

05:34.203 --> 05:35.683
Come on out. Keep
your hands up.

05:35.726 --> 05:37.032
That's it.

05:38.512 --> 05:39.730
27-David. We're speaking
with the residents upstairs.

05:39.774 --> 05:40.775
We're a Code 4.

05:40.818 --> 05:42.298
There is no intruder.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.082
The 911 call was a hoax.

05:44.126 --> 05:45.388
This was a swatting?

05:45.432 --> 05:46.955
HONDO:
Yeah, looks like it.

05:46.998 --> 05:48.304
But we're gonna try
and get some answers.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.479
Like why the hell

05:49.523 --> 05:52.003
a shotgun was discharged
on the police.

05:52.047 --> 05:53.309
Roger that.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.137
MAN:
I got friends

05:55.180 --> 05:57.269
who kill for a living, Nichols.
And guess what?

05:57.313 --> 05:59.097
They're outside your house
right now.

05:59.141 --> 06:00.751
Say hi for me if you see them

06:00.795 --> 06:02.362
before they put a bullet
in your head.

06:02.405 --> 06:05.016
Got that message
30 seconds before you rolled up.

06:05.060 --> 06:07.149
So when I saw movement
in the yard, I just fired.

06:07.192 --> 06:09.499
He's telling the truth. He had
no idea you were the police.

06:09.543 --> 06:11.327
How'd you cut your hand?

06:11.371 --> 06:13.024
I was in the kitchen.

06:13.068 --> 06:14.112
Didn't think
I'd make it to my gun,

06:14.156 --> 06:15.287
so I went for a knife.

06:15.331 --> 06:16.985
Fumbled it, I guess.

06:17.028 --> 06:18.943
You have any idea who would've
left you a message like that?

06:18.987 --> 06:20.336
No clue. Who would want

06:20.380 --> 06:21.511
to do something
like this to us?

06:21.555 --> 06:23.470
It's all so sick.

06:23.513 --> 06:26.037
A sick prank.This is no prank.

06:26.081 --> 06:27.735
This is attempted murder.

06:27.778 --> 06:29.432
With us as the weapon.

06:31.913 --> 06:33.828
â™ª

07:08.471 --> 07:10.430
[helicopter blades whirring][siren whoops]

07:16.392 --> 07:19.003
[exhales]

07:19.047 --> 07:22.093
SANCHEZ:
Imagine retiring in your mid-30s

07:22.137 --> 07:24.226
with a spread like this.

07:24.269 --> 07:26.489
After a decade
as a franchise QB.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.535
Word is Nichols and his wife

07:28.578 --> 07:30.450
have already flipped quite
a few old spreads like this.[indistinct chatter]

07:30.493 --> 07:32.495
We should give the media
a few sound bites,

07:32.539 --> 07:34.541
get ahold of any bad press.

07:34.584 --> 07:36.368
You know how they love
to start in on cops

07:36.412 --> 07:38.283
when there's a swatting.I, uh,

07:38.327 --> 07:41.330
I need to know that, uh,
you have 20-Squad buttoned down.

07:41.373 --> 07:43.201
Being team leader's hard enough

07:43.245 --> 07:45.160
without any,
you know, bad blood.

07:45.203 --> 07:46.509
No bad blood, Commander.

07:46.553 --> 07:49.120
You admitted in my office
that the police commission

07:49.164 --> 07:51.296
sent you to SWAT
to push Hondo out.

07:51.340 --> 07:53.255
Office politics
doesn't affect how I lead

07:53.298 --> 07:55.562
in the field.
I like Hondo.

07:55.605 --> 07:57.955
Everyone will be better off
when he realizes

07:57.999 --> 07:59.566
it's time to move on.

08:02.873 --> 08:04.309
[reporters clamoring]

08:04.353 --> 08:05.963
The news made it here
in record time.

08:06.007 --> 08:08.096
Yeah, I can already
see the headline.

08:08.139 --> 08:11.012
"SWAT team
terrorizes quarterback."I had

08:11.055 --> 08:12.535
a call with the chief
on the way over here.

08:12.579 --> 08:15.320
He's treating it as the
assassination attempt it was.

08:15.364 --> 08:18.019
Now, SWAT didn't start it,
but he wants us to finish it.

08:18.062 --> 08:20.500
[chuckles]
Doing what he loves best.

08:20.543 --> 08:22.327
Soaking up the attention.

08:22.371 --> 08:24.416
Anyone else on the team know the
truth about Sanchez's agenda?

08:24.460 --> 08:26.506
No. Hondo wanted us
to keep quiet

08:26.549 --> 08:28.203
so we don't poison
the locker room.LUCA: Yeah, he wants

08:28.246 --> 08:29.987
to wait it out. He figures
Sanchez will get bored

08:30.031 --> 08:31.511
and move on eventually.[phone ringing]

08:31.554 --> 08:34.339
Days like this, I wonder
why I even bother answering.

08:34.383 --> 08:36.516
Same old vultures with
the same old questions.

08:36.559 --> 08:39.519
Oh. I should take
this. Excuse me.

08:41.390 --> 08:43.348
This is Hicks.

08:45.394 --> 08:47.396
Yeah.NICHOLS:
I don't know how else

08:47.439 --> 08:49.572
to say it. I have no idea
who did this do us.

08:49.616 --> 08:50.834
If I did,
I wouldn't be talking to you.

08:50.878 --> 08:52.619
I'd be handling it.I don't doubt that.

08:52.662 --> 08:54.359
That's exactly what the
culprit was counting on,

08:54.403 --> 08:56.361
that you'd take things
into your own hands.

08:56.405 --> 08:58.538
You really can't think of anyone
who might want to hurt you?

08:58.581 --> 09:00.540
I can think of thousands.

09:00.583 --> 09:01.889
I'd see them every Sunday,

09:01.932 --> 09:03.804
screaming how they want
to tear me apart.

09:03.847 --> 09:05.414
He still gets
heckled sometimes

09:05.457 --> 09:06.807
for that interception
in Seattle.

09:06.850 --> 09:08.373
Six damn years ago.

09:08.417 --> 09:10.245
HONDO:
Think back.

09:10.288 --> 09:12.334
Has either one of you ever
been harassed by a stalker?

09:12.377 --> 09:14.466
No.Never.

09:14.510 --> 09:15.685
Anyone you owe any money to?

09:15.729 --> 09:17.818
Does it look
like we're in debt?

09:21.561 --> 09:24.302
I've been watching you play
since your Dorsey days.

09:24.346 --> 09:27.479
I went to Crenshaw.
Decade ahead of you.[laughs]

09:28.524 --> 09:31.396
Crenshaw. Aw, man.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.398
You clowns were the worst.

09:33.442 --> 09:35.879
[chuckles]You remember
that playoff game in Dallas?

09:35.923 --> 09:37.968
Season on the line,
fourth and goal.

09:38.012 --> 09:40.449
Hmm.You were rolling to
your right, looking

09:40.492 --> 09:41.885
for your open man, but
Davis was right there

09:41.929 --> 09:43.365
waiting to destroy you.

09:43.408 --> 09:44.584
He had about a hundred
pounds on you.

09:44.627 --> 09:46.890
Ended up flat on his back
in the end zone.

09:46.934 --> 09:49.414
See, I knew you were gonna run
that ball even before the snap.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.503
I didn't know before the snap.

09:51.547 --> 09:53.027
Sure, you did.

09:53.070 --> 09:55.595
You were eying the back right
corner of that end zone.

09:55.638 --> 09:57.640
It's subtle, but you have a tell

09:57.684 --> 09:59.076
when you're
holding something back.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.687
You were doing it
way back in high school,

10:00.730 --> 10:02.036
and you did it just now.

10:02.079 --> 10:04.604
What aren't you saying?

10:08.825 --> 10:10.914
You went to Crenshaw,

10:10.958 --> 10:13.438
so you know
how the old neighborhood works.

10:13.482 --> 10:15.353
You rise up out of there,

10:15.397 --> 10:17.007
everybody you ever knew
has got their hand out,

10:17.051 --> 10:18.661
thinks you owe them
something.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.054
I never bit.

10:20.097 --> 10:22.534
You give into one,
next day a dozen show up.

10:22.578 --> 10:23.840
It's like feeding cats.

10:23.884 --> 10:25.407
Think one of them's
jealous or angry enough

10:25.450 --> 10:27.409
to want to take you out?NICHOLS:
I didn't.

10:27.452 --> 10:30.673
But now, who knows?

10:30.717 --> 10:32.066
They were my biggest fans.

10:32.109 --> 10:34.764
Now most of my hate mail
comes from my old zip code.

10:34.808 --> 10:36.505
You save any of
these letters?

10:36.548 --> 10:37.549
[scoffs]

10:37.593 --> 10:38.855
How about you, Carolyn?

10:38.899 --> 10:40.596
Do you hang on to any
of this hate mail?

10:40.640 --> 10:42.685
I just stuff them in a box.

10:42.729 --> 10:45.862
I don't want any of these people
to get in trouble.

10:45.906 --> 10:47.734
I'm sure most of them
were just letting off

10:47.777 --> 10:48.909
some steam,
but some of it's...

10:50.650 --> 10:51.912
It's awful.

10:51.955 --> 10:52.956
How so?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.393
They say Derrick's
a sellout.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.962
Say how they're gonna hurt him.
Hurt me.

10:59.006 --> 11:00.398
Burn our house down.

11:00.442 --> 11:02.792
I thought it would
stop when he retired,

11:02.836 --> 11:05.447
but some people just want
to tear down achievers.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.884
Would you mind turning
over this mail to us?

11:09.407 --> 11:11.409
NICHOLS:
That's my girl.

11:11.453 --> 11:12.933
Asked her out
sophomore year of college

11:12.976 --> 11:14.151
and never looked back.

11:16.414 --> 11:17.807
We about done here, guys?

11:17.851 --> 11:19.461
I got some commitments
I need to get to.

11:19.504 --> 11:21.506
Actually, we were gonna ask
both of you to come with us

11:21.550 --> 11:23.117
to enter protective custody
until things cool down.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.119
Sorry. I don't think so.

11:25.162 --> 11:26.903
Are you opposed to
a security detail?

11:26.947 --> 11:28.557
Free bodyguards? Sure.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.515
Just have them
meet me out front.

11:30.559 --> 11:32.648
Thanks for
everything, guys.

11:36.565 --> 11:37.740
All right,
I'm gonna talk to Sanchez

11:37.784 --> 11:39.481
and see if you and Luca
can hang back.

11:39.524 --> 11:42.527
Do not let Nichols
get out of your sight.Roger that.

11:51.798 --> 11:54.670
Deacon. What's up?

11:54.714 --> 11:55.976
DEACON:May be

11:56.019 --> 11:57.717
none of my business, but...

11:57.760 --> 11:59.849
that call you answered earlier.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.851
You seemed pretty shook.
Does it have anything to do

12:01.895 --> 12:03.853
with the commission
coming after Hondo?[exhales]

12:03.897 --> 12:05.550
Well,
that's a whole separate problem.

12:05.594 --> 12:06.638
No, it's got nothing

12:06.682 --> 12:08.989
to do with that.Okay. Just checking.

12:10.033 --> 12:11.818
The call...

12:13.689 --> 12:15.735
It was, um...

12:15.778 --> 12:17.824
about an old Jane Doe case

12:17.867 --> 12:20.914
I never really quite cracked.

12:20.957 --> 12:23.481
Is it one I know?No, it was
my pre-SWAT days.

12:23.525 --> 12:26.180
I was still working Homicide.
Come here.

12:29.574 --> 12:31.838
It's been 20 years now,
believe it or not.

12:31.881 --> 12:34.057
We found her body
in the brush off Route 27.

12:34.101 --> 12:36.538
Poor girl was barely more

12:36.581 --> 12:38.018
than a kid.

12:38.061 --> 12:40.237
Newspapers dubbed her
Highway Jane.

12:40.281 --> 12:41.935
It says she died
of strangulation?Yeah.

12:41.978 --> 12:44.546
I caught her killer
a month later.

12:44.589 --> 12:46.722
Interviewed him
more times than I care to count,

12:46.766 --> 12:48.680
but he never told us
who she was.

12:48.724 --> 12:51.161
To be honest,
I don't even believe he knew.

12:51.205 --> 12:53.816
So, I waited for someone
to show up and claim her body,

12:53.860 --> 12:55.122
but no one ever did.

12:55.165 --> 12:58.081
We buried her
in an unmarked grave.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.779
Can't imagine the pain.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.476
Yeah, it's kept me up

13:01.519 --> 13:02.825
for nights for 20 years,

13:02.869 --> 13:06.176
not being able to help out
whoever her family was.

13:06.220 --> 13:09.049
I reach out to the coroner's
office a few times a year,

13:09.092 --> 13:11.529
check the status
on the case.

13:11.573 --> 13:14.532
Is that the call you got?
The coroner?Yeah. Apparently,

13:14.576 --> 13:17.057
they ran her DNA through
one of those ancestry databases

13:17.100 --> 13:18.232
everyone's using.

13:18.275 --> 13:20.103
Think they've identified
a first cousin.

13:20.147 --> 13:22.540
They track down this cousin yet?Well,

13:22.584 --> 13:23.933
I've been trying, but the phone
just keeps ringing,

13:23.977 --> 13:27.894
so who knows
how old the contact info is.Huh.

13:27.937 --> 13:31.636
Well, if only we knew somebody
that had the equipment

13:31.680 --> 13:35.205
or resources to pull an address.

13:35.249 --> 13:37.773
Any luck sourcing the 911 call?STREET:
Nope.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.122
But we know it was
placed from a burner,

13:39.166 --> 13:40.820
just like the one
that sent Nichols

13:40.863 --> 13:41.864
a death threat.Same phone?

13:41.908 --> 13:42.909
Yeah.

13:42.952 --> 13:44.127
Whoever swatted Nichols,

13:44.171 --> 13:45.955
they covered their tracks,
but I'm not sure

13:45.999 --> 13:47.565
they're the most sophisticated.

13:47.609 --> 13:49.524
Neither are some of these fans,
judging by the grammar

13:49.567 --> 13:50.830
in these letters.CHRIS:
Get this.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.222
I ran both calls

13:52.266 --> 13:53.745
through our voice ID software.SANCHEZ:Uh-huh.

13:53.789 --> 13:56.879
[distorted]: I got friends
who kill for a living.

13:56.923 --> 13:59.186
Suspect was just using
a voice-changing app.

13:59.229 --> 14:00.840
Simple, huh?SANCHEZ:
Word I'd use

14:00.883 --> 14:02.363
is "creepy," but yeah.

14:02.406 --> 14:04.147
All right,
bring the letters to Forensics.

14:04.191 --> 14:05.975
Have Officer Gibbs take a look.
Tell him I sent you.

14:06.019 --> 14:07.934
He owes me one.Can we help you?

14:07.977 --> 14:10.675
Hi. Justin Wolf.
Derrick Nichols' manager.

14:10.719 --> 14:11.938
I'd like to speak
to whoever's in charge here.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.983
That'd be me.

14:14.027 --> 14:15.855
What can I do for you, Mr. Wolf?

14:15.898 --> 14:16.943
The, uh, people after my client.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.292
How close are you
to catching them?

14:18.335 --> 14:20.033
Mr. Nichols send you here?

14:20.076 --> 14:21.295
No, not explicitly,

14:21.338 --> 14:23.210
but Derrick
pays me three percent.

14:23.253 --> 14:25.865
He knows that means
I keep an eye on things for him.

14:25.908 --> 14:28.258
For three percent of his pay,
you better do more than that.

14:28.302 --> 14:30.260
Believe me, I do.

14:30.304 --> 14:32.262
Derrick pays me three percent
to make sure he stays rich

14:32.306 --> 14:35.048
off the other 97%.Having a marquee quarterback
for a client,

14:35.091 --> 14:36.876
that's got to open
some doors, too, right?

14:36.919 --> 14:38.181
Doesn't hurt,
but I'm the one that pushed him

14:38.225 --> 14:39.879
to license his name
ten years back.

14:39.922 --> 14:40.923
And between that
and the real estate,

14:40.967 --> 14:41.968
everything is paying off.

14:42.011 --> 14:43.795
You really come here
to talk shop?

14:44.840 --> 14:46.320
'Cause I have a feeling
you came here

14:46.363 --> 14:48.017
'cause you want to tell us
who might be trying to kill

14:48.061 --> 14:50.106
your client.WOLF: Just thinking
there might be some way

14:50.150 --> 14:51.891
I could leave
some sort of anonymous tip?

14:51.934 --> 14:53.370
We can keep a secret.WOLF:
Not gonna write my name down

14:53.414 --> 14:54.894
in some report?

14:56.330 --> 14:57.418
You see a pen?

14:59.115 --> 15:00.682
Okay.

15:00.725 --> 15:02.771
There's this guy Dips
from the old neighborhood.

15:02.814 --> 15:05.034
Derrick's handler
since before he was drafted.

15:05.078 --> 15:07.384
Now, over time,
Dips got greedy,

15:07.428 --> 15:08.733
and eventually,
Derrick cut him out,

15:08.777 --> 15:11.867
and it ended very badly.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.738
He ever threaten
Nichols' life?[scoffs]

15:13.782 --> 15:15.871
The death threats
were the least of it.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.220
I mean, it got ugly in the end.

15:17.264 --> 15:19.005
Smashed windshields,
stolen jewelry.

15:19.048 --> 15:20.876
Punches were thrown.CHRIS:
You know where

15:20.920 --> 15:23.096
this Dips guy is now?Okay, last I heard,

15:23.139 --> 15:24.749
selling stolen car parts

15:24.793 --> 15:25.968
somewhere downtown.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.928
CHRIS:
Seems like Hondo's had

15:28.971 --> 15:31.495
an extra eye on you lately.You mean since my mom died?

15:31.539 --> 15:33.541
I guess old habits
die hard.

15:33.584 --> 15:35.673
So, you guys are good now?Yeah.

15:35.717 --> 15:38.372
I mean, I'm not thrilled
that he ghosted us all

15:38.415 --> 15:40.287
when he went to Mexico,
but, uh...

15:40.330 --> 15:41.984
he had a lot going on.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.725
We worked it out.

15:43.768 --> 15:45.118
Which one you
think is Dips?

15:45.161 --> 15:46.510
CHRIS:
Guessing the guy
ignoring the cops.

15:47.555 --> 15:49.122
LAPD.

15:49.165 --> 15:50.950
You Dips?

15:50.993 --> 15:52.255
[hip-hop music playing]

15:56.999 --> 15:59.436
Name is Michael. The only ones

15:59.480 --> 16:03.049
call me Dips
run with Derrick Nichols.

16:03.092 --> 16:04.659
You here
'cause he got swatted?

16:04.702 --> 16:06.356
We're here
cause someone almost killed him.

16:06.400 --> 16:09.185
Someone?
Don't you mean the cops?

16:09.229 --> 16:11.274
Heard you just about
did the deed, too.

16:11.318 --> 16:13.581
[scoffs]
Damn shame.You remember

16:13.624 --> 16:15.670
threatening to kill Mr. Nichols?
Kill his family?

16:16.714 --> 16:18.368
That's what he told you?

16:18.412 --> 16:20.327
Me and him had words, yeah.

16:20.370 --> 16:22.198
Didn't know it was a crime.

16:22.242 --> 16:24.157
Ever place a phony call to 911?

16:24.200 --> 16:27.595
Hell, no. I don't need
to hide behind the police.

16:27.638 --> 16:31.251
I'll meet Nichols face-to-face.
Anytime, anyplace.

16:31.294 --> 16:33.383
I ain't the only one
he's screwed over.

16:33.427 --> 16:35.995
I read what
they say online.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.605
Lots of people
say a lot of things

16:37.648 --> 16:40.260
about celebrities online.They do.

16:40.303 --> 16:42.262
There's this one forum
of, uh,

16:42.305 --> 16:43.785
I don't know, haters.

16:43.828 --> 16:46.440
Maybe you should
check them out.What'll we see if we do?

16:46.483 --> 16:48.790
The dark side
to L.A.'s golden boy.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.400
Waitresses he didn't tip.

16:50.444 --> 16:52.272
Caddies who saw him
cheatin' at golf.

16:52.315 --> 16:54.404
I read about it
at night sometimes.

16:54.448 --> 16:56.493
Relaxes me.

16:56.537 --> 16:58.408
If someone wants
to kill Nichols,

16:58.452 --> 17:00.280
they're on that site, trust me.

17:00.323 --> 17:02.282
Tell him I said good luck.

17:05.372 --> 17:06.721
SANCHEZ:
Hey, Hondo.

17:06.764 --> 17:08.766
When you spoke to
Nichols, you get a sense

17:08.810 --> 17:10.464
he rubs people
the wrong way?

17:10.507 --> 17:13.075
He's rich and famous.
That does it for some folks.

17:13.119 --> 17:16.470
I mean the people he knows.
Think he's the type

17:16.513 --> 17:18.602
that'd have someone
in his own circle targeting him?

17:18.646 --> 17:20.474
You tell me.

17:20.517 --> 17:22.128
What type is that?

17:22.171 --> 17:24.130
[sighs]

17:24.173 --> 17:27.263
You know, I gave you time
to make the right call.

17:27.307 --> 17:30.527
Sticking around SWAT will be
death by a thousand pinpricks,

17:30.571 --> 17:32.094
but that's your choice.

17:32.138 --> 17:34.053
And I'm just fine
with my choices.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.663
What about you, Sanchez?

17:35.706 --> 17:37.056
Whatever deal you cut
with the commission,

17:37.099 --> 17:38.492
you're only using it
to climb the ladder.

17:38.535 --> 17:41.495
You're determined
to make me the bad guy, huh?

17:41.538 --> 17:44.628
That's what you need, Hondo,
that's what I'll be.

17:44.672 --> 17:47.109
You do what you got to do,
but ask yourself this.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.198
How happy are they gonna be
with you in six months

17:49.242 --> 17:50.460
when I'm still here?

17:50.504 --> 17:51.722
DEACON:
Our suspect's back.

17:51.766 --> 17:52.941
Just posted a death threat

17:52.984 --> 17:53.985
on the Nichols forum.

17:54.029 --> 17:56.075
MAN:
Think I gave up?

17:56.118 --> 17:58.207
Think again.
You're dead, Nichols.

17:58.251 --> 18:00.514
No one around you is safe.
No one.

18:00.557 --> 18:02.994
Where's Nichols right now?

18:03.038 --> 18:05.475
[indistinct chatter]

18:05.519 --> 18:07.651
[Nichols chuckles]

18:07.695 --> 18:11.394
â™ª When I wake up in the morning,
I'm-a do it my way â™ª

18:11.438 --> 18:13.701
â™ª Let me do it, watch me do it [phone ringing]

18:13.744 --> 18:16.399
â™ª That's what we do, how we do

18:16.443 --> 18:17.661
â™ª That's what we do...

18:17.705 --> 18:19.141
Hondo, what's up?HONDO:
Hey.

18:19.185 --> 18:20.664
There's been a new threat
on Nichols' life.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.144
He can't be seen in public.
You got

18:22.188 --> 18:23.363
to pull him. Now.

18:23.406 --> 18:25.104
WAGNER:
Nichols?

18:25.147 --> 18:26.322
I'm coming for you!

18:26.366 --> 18:27.628
You son of a bitch!

18:29.020 --> 18:30.631
LAPD! Stop right there![indistinct shouting]

18:30.674 --> 18:33.460
I'm gonna kill you![Tan grunts]

18:33.503 --> 18:35.114
Hey, hey, guys, guys,

18:35.157 --> 18:36.985
guys. Mr. Nichols.

18:37.028 --> 18:38.595
Down, everyone![Tan and Wagner grunting]

18:38.639 --> 18:40.075
LAPD!

18:40.119 --> 18:42.077
Let me go! I'm gonna kill him!LUCA:
I said down!

18:42.121 --> 18:43.339
Let me go!

18:45.515 --> 18:46.603
Do not move.

18:46.647 --> 18:47.996
[Wagner grunting]

18:48.039 --> 18:49.128
Hands behind your back.

18:49.171 --> 18:50.433
Let me go!

18:51.695 --> 18:53.306
You're dead, Nichols!

18:53.349 --> 18:54.437
I'm gonna kill you!

19:02.619 --> 19:03.577
Nichols is the criminal.LUCA:
Look, assault

19:03.620 --> 19:05.274
is a felony, Mr. Wagner.

19:05.318 --> 19:07.146
And what's the punishment for
destroying a marriage, huh?

19:07.189 --> 19:09.278
Son of a bitch
screwed my wife.

19:09.322 --> 19:12.281
The way I see it, Nichols
assaulted me first.

19:12.325 --> 19:14.327
I was on his O-line
for five years.

19:14.370 --> 19:16.024
I spent

19:16.067 --> 19:18.418
half my career protecting
his ass, and this

19:18.461 --> 19:20.681
is how he repays me?
By sleeping with my wife?

19:20.724 --> 19:22.161
That's why you want him dead?

19:22.204 --> 19:24.206
Who says I want him dead?TAN:
You did.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.643
About eight times.
Tried to bash his head in, too.

19:26.687 --> 19:29.646
Or easier just to get him shot
up by police, right? At least

19:29.690 --> 19:31.518
this time, you weren't using us
to cover your tracks.

19:31.561 --> 19:34.260
Using you?
The hell are you talking about?

19:34.303 --> 19:35.913
The swatting
you put into motion.

19:35.957 --> 19:37.654
I had nothing to do
with any swatting.LUCA: Look, Nichols

19:37.698 --> 19:39.178
had an affair
with your wife, all right?

19:39.221 --> 19:40.570
Motives don't get stronger.WAGNER:Yeah,

19:40.614 --> 19:42.181
but I only heard about him
and Amanda an hour ago.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.312
You heard from who?

19:43.356 --> 19:45.488
The radio.

19:45.532 --> 19:47.055
DJs reported

19:47.098 --> 19:49.231
breaking news
about him and Amanda.

19:49.275 --> 19:51.190
They read the texts,

19:51.233 --> 19:52.365
talked about the pics.

19:52.408 --> 19:54.105
Look, I was on my way home

19:54.149 --> 19:55.629
from the gym
when I flipped a U-turn,

19:55.672 --> 19:58.327
decided to come crash
Derrick's book signing instead.

19:58.371 --> 20:01.200
I had nothing to do with
whatever happened before that.

20:03.332 --> 20:04.464
Someone hacked
Nichols' email,

20:04.507 --> 20:06.205
leaked the affair
to Bad Behavior.

20:06.248 --> 20:08.729
Whoever's behind this was
trying to goad an angry husband

20:08.772 --> 20:10.209
into finishing
the job for them.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.167
Just about got
Nichols killed, too.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.517
Now the press is blaming this
lineman for swatting Nichols,

20:14.561 --> 20:16.040
acting like the whole
thing's case closed.

20:16.084 --> 20:17.999
All right, they can report
whatever they want,

20:18.042 --> 20:19.348
but this isn't over.

20:19.392 --> 20:22.438
Nichols and his manager
are on their way here.

20:22.482 --> 20:24.788
All right, get in touch
with someone in that newsroom.

20:24.832 --> 20:26.225
Whoever leaked them this stuff's

20:26.268 --> 20:27.878
involved in the plot
to kill Nichols.

20:27.922 --> 20:29.228
Get a name.

20:32.927 --> 20:34.233
[doorbell rings]

20:37.279 --> 20:38.802
Gail Morgan?

20:38.846 --> 20:40.891
Yeah?Robert Hicks, LAPD.

20:40.935 --> 20:43.024
This is my colleague,
Sergeant Kay.

20:43.067 --> 20:44.895
I was wondering if
we could get a word?

20:44.939 --> 20:46.245
Yeah, sure. What about?

20:46.288 --> 20:48.856
Well, 20 years ago,

20:48.899 --> 20:51.075
a young woman was murdered,
and she was never identified.

20:51.119 --> 20:54.818
Recently, they put her DNA
into a family tree database

20:54.862 --> 20:57.778
and matched
to just one relative.

20:57.821 --> 20:59.301
You.

20:59.345 --> 21:00.911
You're her first cousin.

21:00.955 --> 21:04.001
I'm sorry,
I'm not sure I understand.

21:04.045 --> 21:06.787
Do you have any cousins who
may have dropped off the grid,

21:06.830 --> 21:08.310
say, 20 years ago?

21:08.354 --> 21:10.007
She might've
looked like this.

21:14.011 --> 21:15.317
I don't know what to say.
I mean, I...

21:15.361 --> 21:17.406
I didn't even know
I had any cousins.

21:17.450 --> 21:20.366
Mom was an only child,
and I never knew my dad.

21:20.409 --> 21:23.107
I guess this girl
must be from his side?

21:23.151 --> 21:25.936
Yeah, she, uh,
she'd be his niece.

21:25.980 --> 21:27.416
HICKS: Ma'am, we're
eager to track down

21:27.460 --> 21:29.244
this girl's parents,
and you're the closest

21:29.288 --> 21:30.593
we've come to in two decades.

21:30.637 --> 21:32.943
I mean,
if you could tell us anything

21:32.987 --> 21:34.467
about your father's side
of the family?

21:34.510 --> 21:36.295
Where they're from?
How many siblings?

21:36.338 --> 21:38.035
No clue.

21:38.079 --> 21:40.386
HICKS:
Mm.Mom never talked about him.

21:40.429 --> 21:42.518
I tried to get her to open up
before she died,

21:42.562 --> 21:44.172
but she wasn't
much of a fan.

21:44.215 --> 21:45.608
The only thing

21:45.652 --> 21:48.002
I got from that side
was a few birthday cards.

21:48.045 --> 21:49.308
Those stopped

21:49.351 --> 21:51.353
when I was a kid.HICKS:
Did you happen

21:51.397 --> 21:53.094
to hang on to those cards?

21:53.137 --> 21:54.835
Why would I?

21:54.878 --> 21:56.445
Yeah.GAIL:
I'm sorry.

21:56.489 --> 21:59.274
I-I've got to get ready
for my shift.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.102
You want this thing back?

22:01.145 --> 22:04.410
[inhales] Well,
thanks for your time, ma'am.

22:04.453 --> 22:07.195
Yeah.Sorry for the intrusion.

22:07.238 --> 22:08.631
Hey, the cops

22:08.675 --> 22:10.372
ever catch her killer?

22:10.416 --> 22:12.548
A long time ago.

22:12.592 --> 22:14.942
He's dead now.

22:18.293 --> 22:19.903
HONDO:
When I asked you

22:19.947 --> 22:22.950
about enemies, husbands of women
that you're sleeping with

22:22.993 --> 22:24.430
are exactly the people
that I meant.

22:24.473 --> 22:26.345
And I'm guessing
there's other women?

22:26.388 --> 22:28.564
And other husbands?I should've said something
to you.

22:30.392 --> 22:32.351
I'm sorry.[phone ringing]

22:36.964 --> 22:38.313
It's Carolyn.

22:39.880 --> 22:42.186
She must've seen the news.HONDO:
Go ahead and answer it.

22:42.230 --> 22:43.927
We'll give you some space.

22:43.971 --> 22:46.321
I don't have
football anymore.

22:47.540 --> 22:50.107
If I don't have Carolyn,
I don't know who I am.

22:50.151 --> 22:51.674
What do I even say?

22:52.675 --> 22:54.373
[phone chimes]

22:54.416 --> 22:56.462
Call her back
and tell her the truth.

22:56.505 --> 22:58.159
That you're sorry.

22:58.202 --> 23:00.204
But then I'd recommend
you do more listening

23:00.248 --> 23:01.380
than you do talking.

23:01.423 --> 23:03.033
My life's a lie.

23:03.077 --> 23:04.557
Sure, I had talent,

23:04.600 --> 23:08.256
but once it started paying off,
the money, the women...

23:08.299 --> 23:10.432
I'm a weak man.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.653
Maybe all this

23:13.696 --> 23:16.395
is just the chickens
coming home to roost.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.050
You can't change the past, man.

23:20.094 --> 23:22.139
But you can't fix things
with Carolyn

23:22.183 --> 23:23.706
if you ain't alive
to do it.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.151
HICKS:
30 years

23:34.195 --> 23:36.327
on the force, you'd think I'd
know to not get my hopes up.

23:36.371 --> 23:38.286
Technology
keeps getting better.

23:38.329 --> 23:40.984
Unidentified victims
get their names back every day.

23:41.028 --> 23:42.333
You just got
to give it time.

23:42.377 --> 23:45.249
If time were the answer,
she'd have her name.

23:45.293 --> 23:47.426
Her parents would know
what happened to her.

23:47.469 --> 23:49.210
They could at least visit
her grave.

23:55.608 --> 23:57.436
When you were
working Homicide,

23:57.479 --> 24:00.482
I'm guessing Highway Jane
wasn't the only Doe file

24:00.526 --> 24:01.744
that you couldn't close.

24:01.788 --> 24:04.443
What is it about this case?

24:09.273 --> 24:12.320
You know, I always said that
Barb and the kids were my life,

24:12.363 --> 24:16.411
but I'm, I'm not sure that
was true early in my career.

24:16.455 --> 24:19.588
I wanted Detective so bad,
I'd bring every case home;

24:19.632 --> 24:22.373
I hardly saw JP or Molly.

24:22.417 --> 24:24.550
Finding a-a young girl,
that must've really hit home.

24:24.593 --> 24:26.682
Always does.

24:26.726 --> 24:29.337
But that's not why
this stuck in my craw.

24:29.380 --> 24:32.209
Late one night, Molly came
across the case file on my desk.

24:32.253 --> 24:34.037
[sighs]

24:34.081 --> 24:35.386
What'd she see?

24:35.430 --> 24:38.172
Crime scene photo...
or enough of one.

24:42.132 --> 24:43.612
I used to look out my window

24:43.656 --> 24:45.396
and record myself,

24:45.440 --> 24:48.574
then I'd play back
every fact, every detail.

24:48.617 --> 24:51.490
That's how I worked
my way through a case back then.

24:51.533 --> 24:54.144
But one night,

24:54.188 --> 24:56.320
I turned around,

24:56.364 --> 24:58.322
and Molly was there.

24:58.366 --> 25:00.324
Curled up in a corner.

25:00.368 --> 25:02.065
She couldn't have been there
more than ten seconds

25:02.109 --> 25:03.676
when I realized...

25:03.719 --> 25:05.416
she saw the photo on my desk.

25:05.460 --> 25:08.463
So I threw this thing down
and I ran over to her.

25:09.725 --> 25:11.727
And I, uh...

25:13.729 --> 25:15.644
I had to explain
to my little girl

25:15.688 --> 25:18.647
that the world can be
a dangerous place.

25:18.691 --> 25:21.563
You seem to remember it
all pretty clearly.

25:21.607 --> 25:24.218
I can't forget it.

25:24.261 --> 25:26.263
And then when
she calmed down,

25:26.307 --> 25:28.265
you know, the questions
started-- who's...

25:28.309 --> 25:29.658
out looking for the girl?

25:29.702 --> 25:31.399
Where are her parents, you know?

25:31.442 --> 25:34.533
She asked me to promise that I
would find Jane Doe's real name.

25:34.576 --> 25:38.493
And promise I'd bring her back
to her mom and dad, so...

25:38.537 --> 25:40.364
[chuckles]

25:40.408 --> 25:42.149
...I promised.

25:42.192 --> 25:44.064
I swore it.

25:44.107 --> 25:46.196
You did what was best
for your kid at the time.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.242
It's all you can do.

25:48.285 --> 25:50.810
Yeah, months went by,

25:50.853 --> 25:54.074
and eventually Molly stopped
asking about the case, but...

25:54.117 --> 25:56.729
she never looked
at me the same way again.

25:58.426 --> 26:01.168
At least that's how it felt.

26:02.212 --> 26:04.388
I've seen you two together.

26:04.432 --> 26:06.216
Molly adores you.

26:06.260 --> 26:07.566
No... I-I know.

26:07.609 --> 26:09.263
I-I know she loves me.

26:09.306 --> 26:11.091
It's not that.

26:11.134 --> 26:13.615
I think it made her sad
to find out her dad was

26:13.659 --> 26:16.139
a guy who made promises
that he couldn't keep.

26:16.183 --> 26:18.446
So from then on,
every case I got,

26:18.489 --> 26:21.144
it was a reminder of that piece
of our relationship

26:21.188 --> 26:23.233
my job took away.

26:27.890 --> 26:30.632
When someone puts time and
money into attempted murder,

26:30.676 --> 26:32.460
they're what we call
a persistent threat.

26:32.503 --> 26:34.288
Whoever's after Derrick,
you sure they'll try again?

26:34.331 --> 26:35.811
Well, you sure they won't?

26:35.855 --> 26:37.421
I spoke to the newsroom manager
at Bad Behavior.

26:37.465 --> 26:39.728
She won't give up the source
of the Nichols affair.

26:39.772 --> 26:41.556
Did you tell her
someone's life is at stake?I did.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.253
I pushed as hard as I could.

26:43.297 --> 26:44.733
Call her back.
Ask her if she wants to report

26:44.777 --> 26:46.387
the news
or she wants to be the news.

26:46.430 --> 26:48.607
Here's what you asked for,
Sanchez.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.347
Nichols' latest statement.Great.

26:50.391 --> 26:52.393
All right, I want to go
over this with Nichols.

26:52.436 --> 26:54.569
Where is he?I saw him

26:54.613 --> 26:56.484
in that corner on the phone,
but that was a while ago.

26:56.527 --> 26:58.660
Carolyn left him a voice mail.
He was calling her back.

26:58.704 --> 27:00.749
He wouldn't have left
without me.

27:03.796 --> 27:05.667
This is Derrick,
leave a message.

27:05.711 --> 27:08.191
Straight to voice mail.

27:08.235 --> 27:09.845
Maybe he wanted to speak
to Carolyn face to face.

27:09.889 --> 27:11.804
You think he took off?HONDO:
I really hope not.

27:11.847 --> 27:13.893
His guard's down, and somebody
out there is after him.

27:13.936 --> 27:15.677
I wonder what Carolyn said
in the message?

27:15.721 --> 27:16.765
What are you doing?

27:16.809 --> 27:18.158
A few of my clients
gave me access

27:18.201 --> 27:19.333
to their passcodes just in case

27:19.376 --> 27:21.291
they get locked out
of their accounts.

27:21.335 --> 27:22.771
Here.

27:22.815 --> 27:24.730
I'm in his voice mail.

27:24.773 --> 27:27.646
MAN: We have Carolyn. If you
want her to live, call back

27:27.689 --> 27:29.343
in five minutes
for instructions.

27:29.386 --> 27:31.693
If you're not alone when you do,
your wife is dead.

27:31.737 --> 27:33.695
God, I hope Derrick knows
what he's doing.

27:33.739 --> 27:34.914
He doesn't.

27:42.704 --> 27:45.272
Cops posted at the Nichols house
haven't seen Carolyn in an hour.

27:45.315 --> 27:48.667
Don't know when,
but she was taken.

27:48.710 --> 27:49.929
LUCA:
Well, we pinged Nichols' cell.

27:49.972 --> 27:51.844
He ditched it in a trash can
a few blocks away.

27:51.887 --> 27:53.410
We're pinging Carolyn's phone,
too.

27:53.454 --> 27:55.108
Trying to see when it went dark.

27:55.151 --> 27:56.718
Whoever kidnapped her
is using her as bait

27:56.762 --> 27:58.241
trying to lure Nichols out.

27:58.285 --> 27:59.721
He should've said
something to us.

27:59.765 --> 28:01.027
He's desperate-- he'll
do whatever they say,

28:01.070 --> 28:02.289
meet wherever they want.

28:02.332 --> 28:04.247
All right, bring up
his enemies list.

28:04.291 --> 28:06.380
DEACON:
This is who we're looking at.

28:06.423 --> 28:08.251
Tony Hill mailed
nine death threats

28:08.295 --> 28:09.818
to Nichols
during his final season.

28:09.862 --> 28:11.820
Blake West is
an active user

28:11.864 --> 28:14.693
on the Nichols-bashing site.
Nichols' golf buddy, Ed, is

28:14.736 --> 28:16.738
the only one in his circle with
so much as a speeding ticket.

28:16.782 --> 28:19.306
We've had eyes on these three
the past few hours?

28:19.349 --> 28:21.264
Then there's no way
any of them are the kidnappers.

28:21.308 --> 28:22.744
[door opens]

28:22.788 --> 28:24.528
We know who hacked
into Nichols' emails

28:24.572 --> 28:25.878
and leaked the affair
to the press.

28:25.921 --> 28:27.009
This guy Ollie Jones.

28:27.053 --> 28:28.402
Who is he to Nichols?

28:31.448 --> 28:33.581
Are you sure you don't know him?

28:33.624 --> 28:35.017
I've never seen
that guy in my life.

28:35.061 --> 28:36.802
Why do I get the feeling
you don't believe me?

28:36.845 --> 28:38.760
What about Ollie's
old boss?

28:38.804 --> 28:40.806
Ever lay eyes
on this guy?

28:40.849 --> 28:43.417
Yeah, that's Sam Greer.

28:43.460 --> 28:45.549
Personal trainer
to elite athletes,

28:45.593 --> 28:47.987
turned his business into
a coaching empire-- you know,

28:48.030 --> 28:49.597
Derrick almost cut
a deal with him last month,

28:49.640 --> 28:51.773
but it, uh, fizzled out
at the last minute.

28:51.817 --> 28:54.689
Why? You think Greer had
something to do with this?

28:54.733 --> 28:56.473
Don't know. How big
a deal we talking?

28:56.517 --> 28:58.737
60 million, give or take.

28:58.780 --> 29:00.651
You didn't think
to mention this?

29:00.695 --> 29:02.653
Why would I?
The deal fell through.

29:02.697 --> 29:04.438
Well, if Greer thinks Nichols
screwed him out of money

29:04.481 --> 29:06.745
like that, killing Nichols could
be retribution.

29:06.788 --> 29:09.356
Coaching empire, my ass.

29:09.399 --> 29:11.445
The IRS has been levying
Greer's accounts,

29:11.488 --> 29:13.316
garnishing 80%
of his income.

29:13.360 --> 29:14.927
Sports Commission's
after him, too.

29:14.970 --> 29:16.842
There are doping allegations
involving ten student-athletes.

29:16.885 --> 29:18.931
Hearing's set
for next week.

29:18.974 --> 29:20.628
He gets banned
from contact with athletes,

29:20.671 --> 29:22.108
he's financially ruined.

29:22.151 --> 29:23.805
SANCHEZ: Somebody's been
keeping his head above water,

29:23.849 --> 29:26.677
depositing five grand a week
cash into his account.

29:26.721 --> 29:28.984
This isn't
a one-man job.

29:29.028 --> 29:31.334
Greer has help from
someone well-off.

29:31.378 --> 29:33.641
You.

29:33.684 --> 29:35.077
WOLF:
No, no, no. No, no, no.

29:35.121 --> 29:37.471
I never lied to you.You're the one who put Nichols

29:37.514 --> 29:39.821
in bed with this con man
in the first place.

29:39.865 --> 29:41.954
Exactly how well do
you know Sam Greer?

29:41.997 --> 29:44.130
Not well at all, okay?

29:44.173 --> 29:46.654
I didn't bring Nichols
the Greer deal, I swear to you.

29:46.697 --> 29:48.003
The voice mail
from the kidnappers.

29:48.047 --> 29:49.483
We got a location
on the cell phone.

29:49.526 --> 29:51.093
Do you know where they are?

29:51.137 --> 29:52.834
No, but I know where they were
when they left the message.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.880
Two pings surfaced
on Highway 14

29:54.923 --> 29:56.969
like they were headed
to Mission Valley.WOLF: Wait, Mission Valley?

29:57.012 --> 29:58.709
That's where Greer's
training facility is.

29:58.753 --> 30:00.668
That was
part of his pitch.

30:00.711 --> 30:02.757
A flagship football facility
for up-and-coming athletes.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.672
Remember where it is exactly?

30:05.716 --> 30:07.022
Yeah, you don't forget
a pitch like that.

30:07.066 --> 30:08.458
Place is right here.

30:08.502 --> 30:09.720
It's huge, you can't miss it.

30:19.643 --> 30:21.645
â™ª

30:28.914 --> 30:30.872
Hello?

30:32.787 --> 30:35.007
Carolyn?

30:35.050 --> 30:36.878
Anyone there?

30:36.922 --> 30:38.880
I came alone!

30:43.189 --> 30:45.147
You get recognized on the way?

30:45.191 --> 30:46.757
No.

30:46.801 --> 30:48.542
I laid low, like you said.

30:48.585 --> 30:51.110
Better hand over that little
hooker pistol you got there.

30:51.153 --> 30:53.764
[grunts]

30:57.725 --> 30:59.422
You want to
see your wife?

30:59.466 --> 31:01.685
We got business first.

31:05.211 --> 31:07.213
â™ª

31:15.221 --> 31:17.223
Locker rooms, offices.

31:17.266 --> 31:18.702
Plenty of spots Greer
could be holding them.

31:18.746 --> 31:20.879
Well, that's why this is
a covert entry.

31:20.922 --> 31:21.923
We got to come up
with a rescue plan

31:21.967 --> 31:22.968
before they know we're here.

31:23.011 --> 31:24.012
Who knows what he'll do

31:24.056 --> 31:25.231
if he gets spooked first?

31:25.274 --> 31:26.623
No need to find out.
We'll stay out of sight

31:26.667 --> 31:28.060
until we locate
Nichols and Carolyn.

31:28.103 --> 31:31.063
I want visual confirmation
before we move in.

31:31.106 --> 31:32.847
Luca, Chris,
we need heat signatures

31:32.891 --> 31:34.022
from everyone in there.

31:34.066 --> 31:35.632
Deac and Tan will
breach the side door.

31:35.676 --> 31:36.938
Hondo and Street,
meet you inside.

31:36.982 --> 31:38.505
Let's roll.

31:38.548 --> 31:39.898
You got it.Roger that.

31:40.986 --> 31:42.944
â™ª

31:51.083 --> 31:53.085
Tan, go.

31:57.611 --> 31:58.960
[saw buzzing]

31:59.004 --> 32:00.919
[grunts]

32:00.962 --> 32:02.616
We're in.All right.

32:02.659 --> 32:04.618
Three, two, one.

32:04.661 --> 32:06.533
[door creaks open]

32:08.839 --> 32:11.712
[electricity crackling]

32:15.324 --> 32:17.848
[drone buzzing]

32:30.861 --> 32:32.689
Hit the wall--
someone's coming!

32:32.733 --> 32:35.649
[footfalls echoing]

32:46.877 --> 32:48.618
There's 42 million
in that account.

32:48.662 --> 32:51.012
[cocks gun]Make the transfer.

32:51.056 --> 32:53.580
I told you,
not until I see my wife.

32:53.623 --> 32:56.017
Bring her over!

32:58.672 --> 33:00.761
I'm sorry for
everything, baby!

33:00.804 --> 33:02.023
Did they hurt you?

33:02.067 --> 33:04.025
[grunts]I'm so sorry.

33:04.069 --> 33:05.940
Whatever he wants,
just give it to him.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.289
If I give it to him,
he'll kill us!

33:07.333 --> 33:08.551
Enough!

33:08.595 --> 33:10.771
Just listen
to your wife.

33:10.814 --> 33:12.642
Or maybe

33:12.686 --> 33:14.122
I'll just shoot her
first!

33:14.166 --> 33:15.645
No! No, no, no, don't!

33:15.689 --> 33:17.038
NICHOLS:
Don't!

33:17.082 --> 33:18.126
Where'd that come from?

33:18.170 --> 33:19.258
Anyone got ears?

33:19.301 --> 33:20.737
Sounded like
the southwest corner

33:20.781 --> 33:22.130
of the field house.

33:22.174 --> 33:24.872
Hang tight,
we're getting a read.

33:24.915 --> 33:26.830
I'm counting
six heat signatures.

33:26.874 --> 33:29.050
Hey, fellas.

33:46.850 --> 33:49.114
I can't make out
who's down there.HONDO: We got to get closer.

33:49.157 --> 33:50.115
Let's move.

34:01.865 --> 34:03.432
30 yards out.

34:03.476 --> 34:05.086
HONDO: I see Carolyn.
Both hostages

34:05.130 --> 34:06.914
are in view.
We good to move in?

34:06.957 --> 34:08.263
We have eyes on all suspects?HONDO:
That's a negative.

34:08.307 --> 34:09.699
Only a partial view of Greer.

34:09.743 --> 34:11.179
No angle
on the other gunmen yet.

34:11.223 --> 34:13.007
Stay put until we have eyes.

34:16.141 --> 34:18.230
Wait a minute,
something ain't right.

34:23.278 --> 34:26.107
I think the wife's in on it.What?

34:26.151 --> 34:28.022
What the hell
are you talking about?

34:28.066 --> 34:29.241
Carolyn and Greer
are working together.

34:29.284 --> 34:30.242
She's not a hostage?

34:30.285 --> 34:31.721
HONDO:
No, she's faking it.

34:31.765 --> 34:33.245
Nichols is being set up.
We got to move.

34:33.288 --> 34:34.855
No one move. This is my call.

34:35.986 --> 34:37.901
HONDO:
Sanchez, you're not hearing me.

34:37.945 --> 34:38.902
Things are about
to get real bad.

34:38.946 --> 34:40.121
Stand down, Sergeant.

34:40.165 --> 34:41.818
[Carolyn whimpering]Do it or she dies!

34:42.471 --> 34:43.907
Move in!

34:45.213 --> 34:47.650
LAPD!
Drop the weapons right now!LAPD!

34:47.694 --> 34:50.262
Drop the gun!
Turn around, drop your gun!Drop it! Get on your knees!

34:50.305 --> 34:51.785
I am not going down for this!

34:51.828 --> 34:52.786
Just let her go. Please.

34:52.829 --> 34:54.135
Step aside, Nichols!

34:54.179 --> 34:55.963
You want a hostage, take me!

34:56.006 --> 34:57.747
Get out of the way!
What are you doing?!

34:57.791 --> 34:59.140
Derrick, your wife's
in on it, man!

34:59.184 --> 35:01.273
The two of them
have been working

35:01.316 --> 35:02.796
together to take you out.

35:02.839 --> 35:04.972
That's insane!
Derrick, look at me!

35:05.015 --> 35:06.234
Baby, please tell me
it's not true!

35:06.278 --> 35:07.844
It's not.

35:07.888 --> 35:09.411
Of course it isn't!

35:09.455 --> 35:11.239
You believe some
random cop over me?

35:11.283 --> 35:14.373
Derrick, ask her to explain why
she's been holding Greer's hand.

35:18.464 --> 35:20.292
Fine.

35:20.335 --> 35:22.294
You want real, Derrick?

35:24.252 --> 35:26.776
You ended this marriage
a long time ago.

35:27.864 --> 35:29.997
I've stood by you
since I was 19.

35:30.040 --> 35:32.304
Camps, playoffs,
getting released.

35:32.347 --> 35:35.394
It's always been about you.

35:35.437 --> 35:37.178
Your lies.

35:37.222 --> 35:38.397
Your women.

35:40.181 --> 35:42.009
With me and Sam...

35:42.052 --> 35:44.185
things are different.

35:45.317 --> 35:48.015
[grunts]I'm warning you!

35:48.058 --> 35:49.321
Get back!Drop your weapon!

35:49.364 --> 35:50.757
Take it easy, Greer!

35:50.800 --> 35:51.932
Just calm down!

35:58.808 --> 35:59.548
I'll kill him
if you don't stay back!

35:59.592 --> 36:01.159
We're not going anywhere.

36:01.202 --> 36:02.464
Stay back!

36:02.508 --> 36:05.163
Okay.

36:05.206 --> 36:07.469
We're inside,
staying out of sight.

36:07.513 --> 36:10.168
I'm coming up at eight o'clock,
Luca's at four.

36:10.211 --> 36:11.865
Soon as one of us gets
an angle on Greer,

36:11.908 --> 36:13.214
you want us taking the shot?Yes.

36:16.217 --> 36:18.567
Your best bet is
to give up right now.GREER: Shut up!

36:18.611 --> 36:21.004
Just let me, just let me think.

36:21.048 --> 36:23.224
Just do what he says, man.I said shut the hell up!

36:23.268 --> 36:25.183
Don't do anything stupid!

36:25.226 --> 36:26.314
LUCA:
Nichols is in the way.

36:26.358 --> 36:27.489
If he took one more step

36:27.533 --> 36:29.056
to the right, I'd have the shot.

36:37.064 --> 36:38.239
Move in!

36:38.283 --> 36:39.501
Drop your weapon!

36:39.545 --> 36:41.155
TAN: On the ground!DEACON: Drop it!

36:41.199 --> 36:42.983
TAN: Drop your weapon!
Hands behind your head now!

36:44.027 --> 36:46.160
Suspect down.TAN:
Where'd she go?

36:46.204 --> 36:47.161
Where's Carolyn?

36:47.205 --> 36:48.684
Stop!

36:52.558 --> 36:54.255
Don't move! Don't move.

36:54.299 --> 36:55.474
Get off me, bitch!

36:55.517 --> 36:57.519
[Carolyn whimpering][flex-cuff tightens]

36:58.520 --> 36:59.521
I got her.

37:08.051 --> 37:10.358
Deacon, I'm glad you're here.

37:10.402 --> 37:13.361
I want to apologize
for dumping that on you,

37:13.405 --> 37:15.494
the thing with Molly.No, no, don't mention it.

37:15.537 --> 37:17.931
Um, Commander...

37:17.974 --> 37:19.541
something
you got to see.

37:21.151 --> 37:23.241
"Father marks five
year anniversary

37:23.284 --> 37:25.678
in search for his
missing daughter."

37:25.721 --> 37:29.159
It's from The Rochester,
Minnesota Chronicle,2006.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.381
Jane Doe. We found her.

37:33.425 --> 37:35.644
How?Well, there was something

37:35.688 --> 37:37.342
about the way the cousin
answered your questions

37:37.385 --> 37:39.126
about the birthday cards from
the other side of the family.

37:39.169 --> 37:41.955
So I went back
and talked to her again.

37:41.998 --> 37:44.174
Asked if she'd take
a closer look.

37:44.218 --> 37:46.264
She found one.

37:46.307 --> 37:49.223
She hadn't kept the envelope,
but she let me take the card,

37:49.267 --> 37:50.964
and I brought it to the lab
for the hell of it.

37:51.007 --> 37:55.316
And turns out, there was a faint
imprint from a pen on the back

37:55.360 --> 37:57.405
with the sender's address.

37:57.449 --> 37:59.320
Barely make out the name.

37:59.364 --> 38:01.975
Braun-- do we have contact
information for her family?

38:02.018 --> 38:03.455
There is no family.

38:03.498 --> 38:05.587
Her father died
a few years ago.

38:05.631 --> 38:08.286
Her mother passed away
when she was young.

38:09.330 --> 38:12.246
Kimberly was their only child.

38:14.596 --> 38:16.294
So all those years I obsessed

38:16.337 --> 38:18.034
about what her parents
were going through.

38:18.078 --> 38:19.297
They're gone.

38:19.340 --> 38:20.733
There's no one to tell.

38:20.776 --> 38:22.430
Bob...

38:22.474 --> 38:24.519
you can stand down.

38:26.347 --> 38:27.740
[chuckles softly]

38:27.783 --> 38:29.307
Whoa.

38:29.350 --> 38:31.091
That's her.

38:31.134 --> 38:33.093
Kimberly Braun.

38:34.137 --> 38:35.400
[smacks lips]

38:44.278 --> 38:46.498
Nichols.

38:46.541 --> 38:49.196
I respect what you did today.

38:49.239 --> 38:51.416
Before you knew the
truth about Carolyn.

38:51.459 --> 38:53.635
Running into danger.
It wasn't smart,

38:53.679 --> 38:55.071
but it was heroic.

38:55.115 --> 38:56.508
Not football hero.

38:56.551 --> 38:58.074
Real hero.

39:00.294 --> 39:02.165
I hated you guys.

39:02.209 --> 39:04.864
You know... Crenshaw.

39:06.126 --> 39:08.650
Y'all beat us three out
of my four years in high school.

39:08.694 --> 39:10.435
[chuckles]

39:10.478 --> 39:12.437
Yeah, we didn't think
much of Dorsey, either.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.308
You play?Mm-hmm.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.266
College?Thought about it.

39:16.310 --> 39:18.225
Joined the Marines instead.

39:18.268 --> 39:20.358
You ever regret
not going for it?

39:20.401 --> 39:22.621
My daddy's dream was
to watch me play at Grambling.

39:22.664 --> 39:25.101
But I was stubborn.

39:25.145 --> 39:26.712
So you chose to do the opposite.

39:26.755 --> 39:28.496
Something like that.

39:28.540 --> 39:31.325
I was good, though-- maybe not
a five star recruit like you,

39:31.369 --> 39:33.371
and I probably wasn't
gonna go pro.

39:33.414 --> 39:34.763
But you never know.

39:34.807 --> 39:36.722
I ain't gonna lie.

39:36.765 --> 39:38.680
Can't help but wonder sometimes.

39:38.724 --> 39:41.335
You know what I always
wanted to be?

39:41.379 --> 39:42.858
Hmm?

39:42.902 --> 39:44.294
A cop.

39:44.338 --> 39:45.774
[chuckles]
I guess nobody told you

39:45.818 --> 39:48.124
what they pay cops.[both laugh]

39:49.604 --> 39:51.476
Hey.

39:51.519 --> 39:53.129
Good luck with everything, man.

39:53.173 --> 39:54.479
Thank you, man, appreciate it.

39:54.522 --> 39:56.524
All right.
Stay up.

39:59.484 --> 40:02.356
Aw, second-guessing me

40:02.400 --> 40:04.271
in front of the team?

40:04.314 --> 40:05.751
Textbook
insubordination.

40:05.794 --> 40:07.317
Give me a break, Sanchez.

40:07.361 --> 40:08.841
I was just passing
along what I was seeing.

40:08.884 --> 40:10.886
You're making this easy,
Hondo.

40:10.930 --> 40:13.454
Strike two.

40:13.498 --> 40:14.629
One more, and you're looking

40:14.673 --> 40:16.588
at a mandatory
disciplinary hearing.

40:16.631 --> 40:18.503
Just remember...

40:18.546 --> 40:20.461
you wanted to do this
the hard way.

40:27.599 --> 40:29.905
MOLLY:
You're gonna help her, right?

40:29.949 --> 40:31.864
HICKS: I'm going to do
everything I can.

40:31.907 --> 40:34.606
MOLLY: No, promise me
you'll help her, Dad.

40:34.649 --> 40:37.435
HICKS: Molly, I swear it,
I'll help her.

40:37.478 --> 40:39.915
MOLLY:
What grade was she in?

40:39.959 --> 40:42.744
HICKS:
I... I don't know, sweetie.

40:42.788 --> 40:45.399
But I do know she's in heaven.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.880
I know her friends are there,
maybe her grandparents,

40:47.923 --> 40:50.360
her dog,

40:50.404 --> 40:52.275
and toys to play with.

40:52.319 --> 40:54.495
Okay, honey? Come here.

40:57.237 --> 40:58.586
[clicks]

41:08.988 --> 41:10.598
That's why Sanchez

41:10.642 --> 41:13.296
took this job--
to get Hondo to quit.

41:13.340 --> 41:14.733
That's awful.

41:15.908 --> 41:17.518
We got to do something.

41:17.562 --> 41:18.911
What's in this for Sanchez?

41:18.954 --> 41:20.478
Your guess is as good as ours.

41:20.521 --> 41:21.522
How's Hondo holding up anyway?

41:21.566 --> 41:23.481
He's hanging in there.

41:24.699 --> 41:27.354
I take it you
filled them in?

41:28.703 --> 41:30.444
Sorry. We-we-we had no idea.

41:32.359 --> 41:33.795
What can we do to help?

41:33.839 --> 41:35.797
I don't know what we can do.

41:35.841 --> 41:37.538
Besides wait him out.

41:37.582 --> 41:39.453
I'm done waiting, man.Yeah, so am I.

41:39.497 --> 41:40.802
You've done so much
for all of us.

41:40.846 --> 41:42.412
It's time for us
to return the favor.

41:42.456 --> 41:43.588
You don't need to face this
on your own.

41:44.937 --> 41:46.504
So we're in agreement then.

41:47.809 --> 41:50.551
We solve this problem...

41:50.595 --> 41:52.422
once and for all.
