WEBVTT

01:38.515 --> 01:40.722
Damn, Linden.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.179
What the hell are you doing here
in the middle of the night,

01:43.228 --> 01:44.764
sneaking around in the dark?

01:44.813 --> 01:46.929
I was returning the file
you forgot at my place.

01:46.982 --> 01:48.768
That's where it was.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.057
- Yeah.
- I've been looking all over for it.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.226
I thought I lost it.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.520
What are you doing here
so late?

01:54.573 --> 01:56.985
You know, clock never stops.

01:57.034 --> 01:59.992
Digging around down in storage
halfway to China,

02:00.037 --> 02:02.699
still no Seward file.

02:02.748 --> 02:05.831
Well, it sounds like you have
along night ahead of you.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.832
Good luck.

02:07.878 --> 02:09.288
You miss it?

02:09.338 --> 02:11.078
What?

02:13.967 --> 02:16.674
No, I mean,
I didn't really look.

02:16.678 --> 02:19.511
No?
Not curious at all?

02:19.514 --> 02:21.971
Just opened it up,
closed it real quick,

02:22.017 --> 02:23.177
brought it right back?

02:23.226 --> 02:25.717
Yep.

02:25.771 --> 02:28.558
Stepping in that bouillabaisse
at the factory

02:28.607 --> 02:32.600
nearly ruined
my hush puppies, too.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.319
Why did she get out of the car?

02:41.995 --> 02:45.829
She knows he's not bringing her
there for seX-- not there.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.365
Yet she walks right in.
She doesn't fight.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.749
She doesn't run.

02:49.795 --> 02:52.207
No ligature marks
on her arms or wrists.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.962
No sign of a struggle
outside the scene.

02:55.008 --> 02:58.546
Know he's got a knife,
so maybe he's got a gun, too.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.339
No one's outrunning a bullet.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.888
Or else he knows
how to control them

03:03.934 --> 03:05.765
because he's done it before.

03:05.811 --> 03:06.926
Maybe there's a connection

03:06.978 --> 03:08.969
between this killing
and the Seward job.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.265
No.

03:10.315 --> 03:13.648
No, their throats were cut.
That's it.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.652
Look, your girl was outside.
Mine was in an apartment.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.813
Yours is a teenager.
Trisha Seward was 30.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.116
Yours was raped.
Mine wasn't.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.819
And you closed your case
three years ago.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.405
Yes, we got the guy.

03:26.081 --> 03:30.165
I'm thinking
my guy took trophies.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.997
Bunch of my girl's rings
were missing.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.879
Probably broke her finger
pulling them off.

03:37.509 --> 03:39.795
What do you mean,
broke a finger?

03:39.845 --> 03:41.801
Snapped it in two postmortem.

03:41.847 --> 03:45.214
Seward take any trophies?

03:46.768 --> 03:49.225
No.

03:49.271 --> 03:52.058
Back to square one.

03:54.693 --> 03:57.275
Yeah, well, good luck.

03:57.320 --> 04:02.280
Hey, Linden.
Get them dogs cleaned.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.658
Hey. It’s me, so leave
me a message or whatever.

04:55.712 --> 04:58.124
Hey, Kal. It's me again.

04:58.173 --> 05:00.505
Where the hell you at?

05:00.550 --> 05:01.960
Call me.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.261
Yo, Kallie, wake up!

05:10.310 --> 05:14.644
Hey! Come on!
Answer the door!

05:20.779 --> 05:22.019
- Kallie around?
- No.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.233
She said she was staying here
last night. Where's she at?

05:24.241 --> 05:26.983
I don't know. I-I don't have
time for this, all right?

05:26.993 --> 05:28.654
You mind?

05:29.871 --> 05:31.532
Bitch.

05:41.716 --> 05:44.298
He isn't as fine as you.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.677
Yeah. No shit.

05:49.349 --> 05:53.718
But his look, you know--
God, it's sick.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.315
My look will be like that,
you know,

06:00.360 --> 06:02.316
but sicker.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.728
Going to those
Hollywood parties,

06:04.781 --> 06:06.362
getting to eat fish
off naked girls,

06:06.408 --> 06:08.364
getting free swag.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.992
A lot of girls
would be all up on you--

06:11.037 --> 06:14.404
- models and stuff.
- Yeah.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.959
Come on, Lyric.

06:19.963 --> 06:21.078
Cut it out.

06:21.131 --> 06:24.123
I'm not doing anything.
Leave me alone.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.133
Hey.

06:34.185 --> 06:37.973
Lyric.

06:38.023 --> 06:40.139
Lyric.

06:40.191 --> 06:41.522
Hey.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.183
Hey.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.024
No one's like you.

06:47.073 --> 06:50.565
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:50.619 --> 06:54.032
You got snot and stuff everywhere.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.165
I got to wash up first.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.166
No, you smell good.

07:01.212 --> 07:03.168
Hey.

07:03.214 --> 07:06.001
I don't want you working today.

07:06.051 --> 07:08.383
Mm. Come here.

07:15.101 --> 07:18.639
I got like 60 bucks saved.

07:18.647 --> 07:21.639
Maybe, if you want,
we could go see a movie later,

07:21.650 --> 07:24.266
get Chinese.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.654
Yeah, all right.

07:26.696 --> 07:30.814
But only if we see
something scary,

07:30.867 --> 07:33.108
'cause you
a little scaredy-cat.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.363
Well, you should have
just given Jablonski the file,

07:38.416 --> 07:39.531
like we talked about.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.705
This one's on me.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.335
It's not like we had
nothing to go on.

07:44.381 --> 07:47.043
I mean, th-these girls,
they got regular Johns, pimps.

07:47.050 --> 07:51.043
Jablonski was up.
We would have been up.

07:51.054 --> 07:53.841
Even money says the wife
will be booked by lunch.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.848
Yeah, it blows,
but, you know, it's the job.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.633
Come on. Let's go.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.135
Where are we going?

08:00.188 --> 08:01.519
There's a place
down in The Jungle--

08:01.564 --> 08:04.522
Beacon House, Beacon Home.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.148
They take in runaways.
We might get lucky.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.685
Jesus freaks. Great.

08:08.697 --> 08:11.860
I was talking to Linden
about this case she closed.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.148
Whoa.

08:13.201 --> 08:15.157
- You talked with Linden about this?
- Yeah.

08:15.203 --> 08:17.535
There's a reason
she's not a cop anymore.

08:17.580 --> 08:18.990
I had a hunch--
came up empty.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.029
Well, that's what you get

08:20.083 --> 08:22.039
when you learn
from a bad first partner.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.374
At least with Linden,
you got to learn

08:23.378 --> 08:24.914
if the carpet
matched the drapes, huh?

08:24.921 --> 08:26.661
Yeah, night shift ends,
out to gas works park,

08:26.715 --> 08:27.955
- bend her over the hood...
- Hey.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.294
- ...watch the sunrise.
- It wasn't like that, all right?

08:30.343 --> 08:31.958
- Hey, whatever you say, partner.
- Look. I told you the name 10 times.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.673
So, then,
what's your problem, man?

08:33.722 --> 08:36.839
Kallie Leeds--
L-E-E-D-S.

08:36.891 --> 08:38.882
Just look it up.
Jesus.

08:38.935 --> 08:41.768
Damn, instant karma's a bitch,
ain't it, little man?

08:44.232 --> 08:48.350
Look. Have you seen this girl
in the tombs?

08:48.403 --> 08:49.939
Is that your little lady?

08:51.364 --> 08:53.525
It's a nice ring.
You give that to her?

08:53.575 --> 08:56.066
Where did you find it?
A gum-ball machine?

08:58.163 --> 08:59.994
Your friend's not
in the system.

08:59.998 --> 09:02.284
Didn't pick up anyone
named Kallie Leeds last night.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.459
Well, there you go.

09:03.501 --> 09:06.834
She ain't here. Case closed.
You are welcome.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.337
Hey, Sergeant.

09:11.676 --> 09:13.667
Official hanging procedures--
you believe this?

09:13.720 --> 09:16.507
No longer you hold the left leg,
I hold the right leg.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.922
We got to do homework
to kill this asshole?

09:18.975 --> 09:21.136
This son of a bitch
wants to be hanged.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.886
I got a rope and a lawn chair.
What's the holdup?

09:26.024 --> 09:28.015
The academy didn't teach you
how to get dressed?

09:28.026 --> 09:29.357
Sorry.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.939
Billy started teething.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.232
My wife's going crazy.
We're not really sleeping.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.616
Yeah, well, that sucks.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.778
Still, your focus
has got to be right here.

09:37.827 --> 09:40.284
- You do your eight, then you hit the gate.
- Yeah, yeah.

09:40.288 --> 09:41.994
You just keep pounding
them Red Bulls.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.078
Uh-huh.

09:43.124 --> 09:46.582
Yeah.

09:50.381 --> 09:53.339
27 years, I've never seen
anybody not take the needle.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.090
Seward's turning
this whole place

09:55.136 --> 09:56.717
into a three-ring
circle jerk.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.424
How many executions you done?

09:58.515 --> 10:00.255
Left arm twice.
Brown two years ago.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.639
Elledge in '01.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.970
Working an execution's like
being called up to the show.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.809
Open six!

10:05.855 --> 10:08.813
You're kind of like
the southpaw of the rotation.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.814
More like the specialist
in the pen.

10:10.860 --> 10:15.354
Hey!
I want to make a phone call!

10:15.406 --> 10:17.567
Go shut him up.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.448
Let's go! Open six!

10:19.494 --> 10:20.449
Open.

10:22.497 --> 10:25.079
Opening six.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.037
Copy that. Closing six.

10:28.086 --> 10:30.293
You know the drill, Seward.

10:30.296 --> 10:31.957
Phone call's
only after yard time.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.296
I need to call my lawyer.

10:33.341 --> 10:36.128
I thought you didn't have
a lawyer anymore.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.759
How old's your kid?

10:40.932 --> 10:42.217
What?

10:42.225 --> 10:44.932
Mine did the same.

10:48.273 --> 10:52.312
Must be, what,
uh... two months, three?

10:52.360 --> 10:54.521
Four.

10:54.571 --> 10:57.859
You got to take off your shirt
when you burp them.

10:57.907 --> 11:00.819
I saved a few of mine that way.

11:05.748 --> 11:09.411
My lawyer's gonna help me
see my kid one last time.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.834
I got to talk to him.

11:18.970 --> 11:20.460
Turn around.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.504
Put your hands
through the hole.

11:40.366 --> 11:44.154
Well, look
what the rain washed in.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.195
Come on in.

11:50.335 --> 11:53.873
Well, there's always pressure
from somewhere, you know?

11:53.922 --> 11:58.165
But, uh, I'll leave the politics
to the politicians.

11:58.218 --> 12:01.710
You know, heading up
special investigations--

12:01.763 --> 12:04.345
it's--
it's where I belong.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.722
You still take
your coffee black, Sarah?

12:06.768 --> 12:08.133
Ido. Thanks.

12:14.943 --> 12:18.561
So, uh, how's, uh... how's
civilian life treating you?

12:18.613 --> 12:20.399
It's good.

12:20.448 --> 12:21.563
Yeah, I love the island.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.405
It's really been
a change for the better.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.950
Well, you look good.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.826
I'm happy for you.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.749
Now, I must have been
off the street too long.

12:36.798 --> 12:40.791
I mean, I assume...

12:40.802 --> 12:42.793
this is why you're here?

12:45.223 --> 12:47.555
Aren't that many cops
who know what it's like

12:47.600 --> 12:50.558
having one of their guys
executed.

12:52.981 --> 12:55.973
I always had questions.
You know that.

12:58.027 --> 13:01.190
Well, you worked
a solid case out.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.733
The DA thought so.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.898
The 12 members
of the jury did, too.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.942
But nothing's 100%--
not in our line of work.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.068
You know that.

13:08.121 --> 13:12.239
Trisha Seward's finger
was broken postmortem.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.954
I went back
through the case file.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.623
It was, uh, her ring finger,
but we never found a ring

13:17.630 --> 13:19.621
on her body
or at the crime scene.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.419
Yesterday, a working girl
was found in West Seattle

13:22.510 --> 13:25.092
with... her throat cut
ear to ear,

13:25.138 --> 13:26.628
just like
the Seward woman--

13:26.681 --> 13:28.888
broken finger, missing jewelry.

13:30.435 --> 13:33.802
Finger broken, jewelry missing.

13:36.482 --> 13:39.394
It's a stretch, I know.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.396
But what if there's
a connection?

13:41.487 --> 13:42.943
What if--

13:42.989 --> 13:44.604
Ray Seward
didn't kill his wife?

13:44.657 --> 13:46.773
Yeah.

13:55.626 --> 13:59.244
Seward called me here...

13:59.297 --> 14:01.583
today, at my home.

14:01.632 --> 14:03.588
That's right.

14:03.634 --> 14:06.797
He invited me to his execution.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.925
He said, "Bring the wife,
the kids,

14:09.974 --> 14:11.760
and a bag of Ding Dongs."

14:16.939 --> 14:20.773
He requested hanging...

14:20.777 --> 14:22.984
which he'll have.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.852
Yeah.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.147
I should go.

14:30.828 --> 14:33.615
Please tell Jen
thanks for the coffee.

14:33.664 --> 14:37.657
Those aren't the actions
of an innocent man, Sarah.

14:37.668 --> 14:42.583
Ijust want to be sure
we're executing a guilty one.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.271
Stay away from us.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.359
I've forgiven him,

15:09.409 --> 15:11.525
but I don't ever
want to see you again.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.687
What's going on?

15:48.739 --> 15:52.778
I mean, I thought we had
a good thing, Sarah.

15:55.621 --> 15:59.785
Last night,
and then some guy shows up,

15:59.834 --> 16:02.541
- and you--
- You don't know me.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.703
What?

16:06.299 --> 16:08.665
I break things.

16:14.182 --> 16:15.843
I do-- I break them,

16:15.892 --> 16:18.008
and they don't ever get fixed.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.474
But this thing,
this one thing--

16:22.523 --> 16:24.138
Sarah.

16:25.651 --> 16:28.643
Ican help.

16:28.654 --> 16:32.192
Just let me help you.

16:33.868 --> 16:36.985
Sorry.

16:55.389 --> 16:56.925
What is it?

16:56.933 --> 16:58.013
Seattle PD.

16:58.059 --> 17:00.141
We've got some questions
about this kid Ashley--

17:04.774 --> 17:07.186
Yo! It's the police!

17:07.235 --> 17:09.066
Open this damn door!

17:13.699 --> 17:16.657
I'm gonna need to see
some identification.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.442
Whatever you say, Padre.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.995
Got some questions
about a girl-- one of yours.

17:20.998 --> 17:22.784
Ashley Kwon.

17:22.833 --> 17:26.246
Happy to have a convo
after I see some ID.

17:26.295 --> 17:30.038
All right,
you want to see some ID?

17:30.049 --> 17:31.334
Here you go.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.877
Hey. What's with the security,
Padre?

17:35.930 --> 17:39.343
Some of the girls' pimps
or ex-boyfriends come in here,

17:39.392 --> 17:42.680
claiming to be family
or social workers or whatever,

17:42.728 --> 17:44.309
trying to take them back.

17:44.355 --> 17:46.846
Yeah, okay. So, the last time
you saw Ashley Kwon

17:46.899 --> 17:47.979
was five days ago?

17:48.025 --> 17:50.141
Yeah, she had a bed here
for a few nights,

17:50.152 --> 17:51.938
- then she went awol.
- Huh.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.604
You don't seem too surprised
about how she ended up.

17:54.657 --> 17:56.022
Well, after being here
a few years,

17:56.033 --> 17:57.898
there's not a lot
of surprises left.

17:59.662 --> 18:02.028
That's Ashley?

18:02.039 --> 18:03.028
Yeah.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.743
Did she have a pimp?

18:04.750 --> 18:06.536
Run with the street family?

18:06.586 --> 18:08.577
I don't pry into their lives.

18:08.629 --> 18:11.371
Beacon is a safe space.
No questions asked.

18:11.465 --> 18:14.957
They can come here,
and they can be kids again,

18:14.969 --> 18:16.800
even if it's just
for a few hours.

18:16.804 --> 18:19.466
That's the most recent photo
I've got.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.307
We've been asking around
all the usual places.

18:23.311 --> 18:24.972
Do you know anywhere
off the grid

18:25.021 --> 18:26.557
where Ashley might have stayed?

18:26.606 --> 18:29.564
Uh, there's a motel
off 99-- Queens.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.190
I know
she's stayed there before.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.567
It's kind of a last resort
for some of the kids

18:33.613 --> 18:36.025
if they can't get a bed here
or the other shelters.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.938
Thanks, Father.

18:37.992 --> 18:40.608
Yeah, and to answer
your question, Detective,

18:40.661 --> 18:43.619
if I don't keep track
of these kids, no one will.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.620
And it's "Pastor," by the way.

18:45.666 --> 18:48.624
So you're just the light
at the end of the tunnel.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.914
No, the light at the end
of the tunnel is

18:50.963 --> 18:52.578
the train that's speeding
towards them.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.624
I'm just trying to pull them
off the tracks.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.804
All right.
All clear.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.060
Lucky number seven.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.936
Last time you got to piss
in front of me.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.222
I know how much
you're gonna miss it.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.067
So, you've been doing
really good.

19:15.112 --> 19:16.397
How's everything else?

19:16.489 --> 19:17.945
Look like you lost some weight.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.230
You been eating?

19:19.241 --> 19:21.402
Yeah. Every day.

19:21.410 --> 19:22.616
Probation's almost up.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.277
We got to start thinking...

19:24.288 --> 19:25.619
about the next move.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.951
Did you, um, check out
any of those GED classes

19:27.958 --> 19:29.084
I talked to you about?

19:29.085 --> 19:30.950
No, not really my thing.

19:30.961 --> 19:33.623
No, as soon as I clear this,
I'm heading to LA,

19:33.673 --> 19:35.755
doing some modeling and acting.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.758
Yeah, the problem with dreams
is that they stay dreams,

19:38.803 --> 19:40.964
not reality, for most.

19:40.971 --> 19:42.802
Remember, you got to be
the one to make things happen,

19:42.848 --> 19:44.054
so stay clean, focused,

19:44.100 --> 19:46.933
and, um, I'll see you next week
with the results.

19:46.977 --> 19:48.968
Sweet.

19:55.945 --> 19:57.560
Yeah, when Twitch
starts modeling,

19:57.613 --> 19:59.194
he said we'll have
lots of money

19:59.240 --> 20:00.446
and we won't have
to pull dates anymore.

20:00.491 --> 20:02.652
He said you could come
with him to California?

20:02.660 --> 20:05.367
Hell, yeah, he did,
like he was begging me.

20:05.413 --> 20:07.904
"Please, baby.
Please, please, please."

20:07.957 --> 20:11.870
And I was like,
"Okay. Maybe."

20:11.919 --> 20:14.251
Hey, Lyric,
you looking fine, girl.

20:14.296 --> 20:17.788
Don't run away from me,
bitches. I got a limp.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.423
Okay, be like that.

20:19.510 --> 20:21.967
You're all-- you're all--
you're all teeth, anyways.

20:21.971 --> 20:25.964
That's why you only suck
dime slots and high-schoolers.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.011
Yo, what's up, guys?

20:29.228 --> 20:30.809
What's up, Bullet?

20:30.855 --> 20:31.970
Any of you guys
seen Kallie around?

20:31.981 --> 20:35.064
Hey, shorty.
I seen Kallie.

20:35.109 --> 20:37.065
Where?

20:37.111 --> 20:38.351
Where?!

20:38.404 --> 20:40.190
7-Eleven.
Candy aisle.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.775
Chicken-head slut
got her throat cut.

20:41.824 --> 20:43.780
- Now she a PEZ dispenser.
- Do you want me to kick your ass, huh?

20:43.826 --> 20:45.032
Is that what you want?

20:45.077 --> 20:46.738
You better get up
out of my face, bitch.

20:46.787 --> 20:47.902
You gonna shoot me?

20:47.955 --> 20:49.695
Is that what you're gonna do?

20:49.707 --> 20:51.288
All right, Goldie.
Come on.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.745
Shoot me.
Pull the trigger.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.375
That's what I thought.

20:55.463 --> 20:56.748
You're nothing
but a punk-ass pussy bitch.

20:56.797 --> 20:57.957
I got more balls than you.

20:58.007 --> 21:01.920
Okay. Y'all know
we're just joking, right?

21:01.927 --> 21:03.963
- You better watch your bitch ass.
- Yeah? You better watch yours.

21:15.441 --> 21:16.977
You get one.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.815
Look, I take
full responsibility.

21:18.861 --> 21:20.351
Shut your mouth.
You get one.

21:20.404 --> 21:22.736
You get one screw-up.
The first one-- that's on me.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.239
But the next time
you break protocol,

21:25.284 --> 21:26.524
that is me on you.

21:26.577 --> 21:27.783
Do you understand?

21:27.828 --> 21:29.284
Seward said
he was gonna call his lawyer.

21:29.330 --> 21:32.914
He didn't call his lawyer.
He called a cop.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.994
A cop, Henderson!

21:35.044 --> 21:37.376
What did he say to you?

21:37.379 --> 21:39.916
He said that, uh,
he wanted to see his son.

21:39.924 --> 21:42.006
- He asked me about Billy.
- Aw, that's sweet.

21:42.051 --> 21:43.712
So, just the two of you
swapping baby tips

21:43.761 --> 21:45.092
like two daddies
in a playground.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.970
Open it.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.731
Go get the other guy.

22:02.780 --> 22:05.772
Tell him I want to order
a Meat Lover's pizza.

22:05.825 --> 22:08.783
"Chapter one.

22:08.828 --> 22:12.787
Essentially, execution
by hanging is strangulation

22:12.832 --> 22:15.494
effected by restricting
the executee's air supply

22:15.543 --> 22:17.249
at the neck,

22:17.294 --> 22:21.128
unconsciousness occurring
between two and four minutes,

22:21.173 --> 22:23.664
and death within 10,

22:23.717 --> 22:25.969
resulting in death
by asphyxiation."

22:26.011 --> 22:27.512
That's not needed.

22:27.555 --> 22:31.389
You're a-a better man
than that, Francis.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.048
Sit your ass down, Dale.

22:33.102 --> 22:35.388
Unless you want to be jacking off
to memories of your girlfriend,

22:35.437 --> 22:36.973
go sit down.

22:36.981 --> 22:38.517
Hey.

22:38.524 --> 22:41.436
Hey.

22:43.571 --> 22:47.155
I knew a Jimmy Becker.

22:47.199 --> 22:50.987
He's a guard at Cedar Creek.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.243
Is there any relation?

22:55.749 --> 22:58.661
Hmm?

22:58.711 --> 23:00.121
Of course there is.

23:00.170 --> 23:01.956
It's a family business--

23:02.006 --> 23:05.624
prison guards
and racecar drivers.

23:07.636 --> 23:11.925
Well, get on with it, Francis.

23:11.974 --> 23:15.808
It was just getting good.

23:17.521 --> 23:20.263
"Depending
upon the equipment used,

23:20.316 --> 23:23.979
there will be
some physical trauma

23:23.986 --> 23:25.977
to the executee's body.

23:25.988 --> 23:31.233
A mathematical miscalculation
can result in..."

23:48.135 --> 23:51.969
Last exit to nowhere.

23:51.972 --> 23:56.056
Why can't these kids ever find
a place with a bar?

23:58.145 --> 24:01.512
If we crap out here, I'll buy
the first round, all right?

24:01.565 --> 24:02.850
That make you happy?

24:06.028 --> 24:08.815
Just knock.
They'll probably let you watch.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.574
Hey, mamacita.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.578
Seen this girl around?

24:17.623 --> 24:19.363
I'm a cop
investigating a homicide.

24:19.416 --> 24:20.997
Thatjog
your old-ass memory?

24:21.043 --> 24:22.999
Honey, I don't care
if you're six cops.

24:23.045 --> 24:25.001
I watch shows.

24:25.047 --> 24:27.003
You need a warrant
if you want to bother me.

24:29.385 --> 24:33.298
Put the damn specs on
and look at the picture.

24:33.347 --> 24:35.508
On second thought,
um, you know,

24:35.557 --> 24:37.969
me and my partner here--
we need a room.

24:38.018 --> 24:40.725
You know, we work together,
but we...

24:40.771 --> 24:42.887
You got an ice machine?

24:42.940 --> 24:45.181
'Cause we're gonna
settle in real tight

24:45.234 --> 24:47.566
and spend a few days
making sweet, sweet love.

24:47.611 --> 24:49.067
You know, when my big old bear
over here,

24:49.071 --> 24:51.062
when he-- when he gets started
on that vibrating bed,

24:51.073 --> 24:52.859
he never wants to leave.

24:55.577 --> 24:57.113
That's what I'm talking about.

24:57.121 --> 24:58.952
Give me a smile,
mama-san.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.580
Yeah, that's it.
I like it.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.286
Never seen her.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.667
Yeah? 'Cause we got a witness
says our dead girl

25:05.713 --> 25:07.829
was here two nights ago.

25:07.881 --> 25:09.542
Kallie said that?

25:09.591 --> 25:13.880
Kallie was cussing up a storm
in the parking lot

25:13.929 --> 25:16.341
a couple nights ago,
and I had to boot her out,

25:16.390 --> 25:19.348
and now she's trying to say
I know some dead girl,

25:19.393 --> 25:21.725
which is a damn lie.

25:21.770 --> 25:24.056
I try and help these kids,

25:24.106 --> 25:28.395
and this is how they repay me.

25:30.070 --> 25:32.402
Need to check my balls
for lice after going in there.

25:32.448 --> 25:34.063
That girl at the station
this morning--

25:34.116 --> 25:36.949
she was looking for Kallie,
thought she was missing.

25:36.994 --> 25:39.610
5 Point or Sloop's?
Your dime, your choice.

25:39.663 --> 25:41.779
Kallie got thrown out of here,

25:41.832 --> 25:43.914
she'd have to walk
this road back.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.915
It's the only way
back to The Jungle.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.747
I mean, t-those kids
might have seen her.

25:47.796 --> 25:49.377
Clock stopped 45 minutes ago.

25:49.423 --> 25:51.835
Come on. We're here.
W-we got to talk to them.

25:51.884 --> 25:54.216
Thought you were gunning
for your stripes, being smart,

25:54.261 --> 25:55.762
putting cases in the black.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.920
Now we're looking for a missing
girl that's not even missing?

25:57.973 --> 26:00.055
We're here, all right?
It'll take a couple of minutes.

26:00.100 --> 26:03.388
Go, go. Just go.
Have a talk.

26:24.875 --> 26:27.662
Get in, or I'm leaving you.

26:43.685 --> 26:46.301
I knocked
a couple times, but...

26:49.691 --> 26:51.898
I brought some leftover cake.

26:51.944 --> 26:54.060
Ellen wanted it off the boat.

26:54.113 --> 26:56.525
She said
she lacks self-control.

26:56.573 --> 26:57.983
I say live a little,
but--

26:58.033 --> 26:59.534
Just say it.

26:59.576 --> 27:02.113
Say what?

27:02.162 --> 27:04.118
I have about a million times.

27:04.164 --> 27:05.995
I mean, you're gonna do
whatever it is

27:05.999 --> 27:07.079
that you need to do,

27:07.126 --> 27:10.459
and nobody's gonna
convince you otherwise.

27:18.679 --> 27:21.091
Adrian drew that over and over

27:21.140 --> 27:23.973
after I found him
in the apartment.

27:25.853 --> 27:28.515
He'd been trapped there
for six days

27:28.522 --> 27:30.683
with his mom's
decomposing body.

27:30.732 --> 27:34.850
I never told you that part.

27:34.903 --> 27:37.360
So, now you're gonna drag him
back into this,

27:37.364 --> 27:39.025
make him relive it
all over again?

27:39.032 --> 27:40.533
It's almost four years.

27:40.576 --> 27:43.158
In that time, he's been
in and out of foster homes.

27:43.203 --> 27:45.945
He's not you, Sarah.
He doesn't need you to save him.

27:45.998 --> 27:50.037
But he deserves to know
the truth.

27:50.085 --> 27:53.452
Will that make it better
for him or just you?

28:12.566 --> 28:13.555
Open seven!

28:53.982 --> 28:56.974
Where's Skinner?

28:56.985 --> 28:58.646
He's not coming.

28:58.695 --> 29:00.651
Yeah, then you're wasting
my time.

29:00.697 --> 29:02.312
But he couldn't care less
about you.

29:06.036 --> 29:08.869
Yeah, I remember you
from the trial.

29:08.914 --> 29:10.370
You're his partner.

29:10.415 --> 29:13.327
I was.

29:13.377 --> 29:16.164
Why do you want to see him?

29:16.213 --> 29:20.582
'Cause he lied in court.

29:22.719 --> 29:25.335
He called me a coward.

29:25.347 --> 29:28.805
He said I was weak.

29:28.850 --> 29:33.093
There's nothing weak
about holding down a woman

29:33.146 --> 29:38.482
and sawing through the muscles,
the tendons, in her neck,

29:38.527 --> 29:41.269
all while she's looking
up at you

29:41.321 --> 29:45.690
with her windpipe cut,
trying to breathe.

29:49.037 --> 29:53.952
So... you tell Skinner
that I want him to be here.

29:54.001 --> 29:55.957
I want him standing right there

29:55.961 --> 29:58.293
when they put the noose
around my neck.

29:58.338 --> 30:04.880
And tell him that I want him
to look me in the eye,

30:04.886 --> 30:09.471
'cause then we'll find out
who the real coward is.

30:11.143 --> 30:13.850
What did you do
with your wife's ring?

30:14.980 --> 30:17.266
What?

30:17.274 --> 30:20.482
Your wife.

30:23.363 --> 30:27.572
Her finger was broken
postmortem.

30:29.202 --> 30:31.329
You took her ring.

30:31.371 --> 30:33.783
What did you do with it?

30:33.832 --> 30:35.914
I pawned it.

30:35.959 --> 30:38.336
- Where?
- At a pawn shop.

30:38.378 --> 30:40.039
Which one?

30:54.061 --> 30:58.896
Your son, Adrian,
just kept drawing this

30:58.940 --> 31:01.898
over and over.

31:01.943 --> 31:04.901
Why?

31:04.946 --> 31:06.356
Why?

31:08.408 --> 31:09.397
Guard.

31:17.626 --> 31:19.787
I don't have a son.

31:40.941 --> 31:42.932
And my lawyer's gonna
hear about this, too!

31:42.943 --> 31:44.979
It's cruel and unusual!

31:45.028 --> 31:46.143
No right moving me around!

31:46.196 --> 31:48.107
Man, you two woods
just like the judge!

31:48.156 --> 31:50.488
I was railroaded!
B&O and short line!

31:50.534 --> 31:52.820
- Turn around.
- Didn't want you to get lonely, Ray.

31:52.869 --> 31:55.861
Hey, and I want my books, too.
I want my books.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.870
You know them dumbass boys
down there in ”D"

31:57.916 --> 32:00.828
can't read anyhow.

32:00.836 --> 32:03.828
Aw, damn.

32:03.839 --> 32:06.125
Is that Ray Seward?

32:06.174 --> 32:09.291
Is that Mr. Big Noise?

32:09.344 --> 32:12.507
Ray. Ray.

32:12.556 --> 32:15.844
Hey, man, everybody up in here
got your name in their mouth.

32:15.892 --> 32:18.884
Man, I don't know who's
trending more, you or Jesus.

32:18.937 --> 32:22.771
Look, Ijust need some advice.
Know what I'm saying?

32:22.816 --> 32:25.023
I'm just trying to figure out how
I can work these fools, you know?

32:25.068 --> 32:26.569
I got my Pardon Board
coming up.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.351
I wrote my own motion
of appeal.

32:28.405 --> 32:30.566
You want to hear it, man?
I got it right here in my head.

32:30.615 --> 32:32.992
Let me give it to you.

32:40.709 --> 32:42.290
Hey, crime fighter.

32:42.335 --> 32:45.122
Hey.

32:45.172 --> 32:46.833
Hmm.

32:46.882 --> 32:49.294
"Serenity."
Mm.

32:49.342 --> 32:50.673
Sounds like a stripper's name.

32:50.719 --> 32:53.836
Yeah, actually.
I should get that removed.

32:53.889 --> 32:55.754
Uh, yeah. That, okay.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.640
Um, we need to talk.

32:58.643 --> 33:00.474
Toothbrush is the first step.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.262
And next,
it'll be your clothes.

33:03.315 --> 33:04.646
And then your friends,

33:04.691 --> 33:06.807
and then I'm gonna
make you get me a ring.

33:06.860 --> 33:09.852
And a dog, because what
I really want is a kid,

33:09.863 --> 33:11.694
but-- but I don't
want to scare you off,

33:11.698 --> 33:15.987
so I have to take baby steps.

33:16.036 --> 33:18.698
Seriously, it was an--
an old white-elephant gift.

33:18.747 --> 33:20.328
Did you just, like--

33:20.373 --> 33:22.830
what, y-your old one?
It's right here.

33:22.876 --> 33:23.956
It's right here in the drawer.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.287
- You know, Marty The Molar...
- Okay?

33:25.337 --> 33:26.668
...gave that to me
in third grade

33:26.713 --> 33:28.749
'cause I had
proper flossing technique.

33:28.757 --> 33:30.839
Ah, yeah.

33:30.884 --> 33:31.839
Thank you.

33:31.885 --> 33:34.126
You're welcome.

33:34.179 --> 33:35.965
So sweet to me.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.972
I got a new "Untamed & Uncut"
on the DVR.

33:39.017 --> 33:39.972
What?

33:40.018 --> 33:41.974
Oh, double white shark attack.

33:41.978 --> 33:43.263
Oh, snap.

33:43.313 --> 33:44.849
No joke.

33:44.898 --> 33:49.141
I'll get
the microwave popcorn ready.

33:49.194 --> 33:52.686
And keep the tat.

33:52.739 --> 33:55.572
It's hot.

34:00.205 --> 34:03.538
"After chemicals
are applied to one side,

34:03.583 --> 34:06.370
repeat steps three to six."

34:06.461 --> 34:08.622
All right.

34:14.261 --> 34:16.627
Check it out.

34:16.638 --> 34:18.424
What are you doing?

34:18.515 --> 34:21.723
Oh, damn,
this stuff's itchy as hell.

34:21.768 --> 34:25.352
You spent all our money
on this?

34:25.397 --> 34:27.353
What?

34:27.399 --> 34:31.312
I thought you said
we were gonna lay low.

34:31.361 --> 34:33.147
I didn't spend it.

34:33.196 --> 34:34.857
I invested it.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.646
No, this is an investment.

34:36.700 --> 34:38.361
Well, the sooner I get
my head shots,

34:38.410 --> 34:39.775
the sooner I start modeling,

34:39.828 --> 34:43.070
the sooner the money
comes rolling in.

34:43.123 --> 34:46.081
Huh?
I know what I'm doing.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.075
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

34:48.086 --> 34:49.622
Okay.

34:49.671 --> 34:52.959
Well, look, um, you know,

34:52.966 --> 34:55.298
we're still gonna need
some walking-around scratch,

34:55.302 --> 34:56.508
you know, just for now.

34:56.553 --> 34:59.670
I was gonna pull
a date tonight,

34:59.723 --> 35:01.304
but I got to let
this stuff settle.

35:01.349 --> 35:03.180
You know,
it's what the pros use.

35:03.184 --> 35:05.015
I got to leave it in all night.

35:06.187 --> 35:08.724
It's okay, baby.

35:08.732 --> 35:11.348
I can go out.

35:11.401 --> 35:13.608
Oh, Lyric, girl.

35:13.653 --> 35:15.814
You're the best.

35:17.616 --> 35:19.072
Now you want to help me
do the other side?

35:19.117 --> 35:20.357
Yo, Lyric!

35:20.410 --> 35:22.025
You seen Kallie up in here?

35:22.078 --> 35:23.363
Ever heard of knocking, Bullet?

35:23.413 --> 35:24.744
Oh, shut up.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.905
No, didn't see her.
Why?

35:26.958 --> 35:28.198
'Cause no one has.

35:28.251 --> 35:29.582
She ain't picking up her phone.

35:29.628 --> 35:30.959
She ain't at Beacon
or the bridge.

35:31.004 --> 35:32.289
She's gone.

35:32.339 --> 35:34.751
She'll show up.
Don't worry.

35:34.799 --> 35:38.041
Oh, Goldie's been turning out
a new girl at his pad.

35:38.094 --> 35:41.052
Yeah. Didn't know?

35:41.097 --> 35:42.928
What are you talking about?

35:42.974 --> 35:45.090
1--
that's what I heard.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.099
You know he's always
wanted to stick it to Kallie,

35:47.145 --> 35:48.726
so one plus one...

35:52.067 --> 35:56.276
That is one crazy bitch.

36:43.118 --> 36:44.779
Kallie?

36:44.828 --> 36:45.943
Kallie?

36:45.995 --> 36:49.783
You punk-ass bitch.

36:49.833 --> 36:51.573
What do you think you're doing?

36:51.626 --> 36:54.584
Huh?

36:54.629 --> 36:57.621
Stop!

37:00.135 --> 37:03.252
Get off me! Aah!

37:04.973 --> 37:09.091
Just-- think you're hard,
huh? You think you're a man?

37:09.102 --> 37:11.138
You're just a little bitch

37:11.187 --> 37:13.143
that needs to be broke
like the rest.

37:16.401 --> 37:17.811
Stop!

37:23.783 --> 37:25.899
Please, no.

37:25.910 --> 37:28.572
No. Please.

37:28.580 --> 37:31.572
Please. Please.

37:37.046 --> 37:39.833
No. No.

37:48.308 --> 37:50.264
It's nice of you to come
and check in on Adrian,

37:50.310 --> 37:51.675
after all these years.

37:51.686 --> 37:53.517
Ijust wanted to see
how he's doing

37:53.521 --> 37:56.137
with everything that's
going on with his father.

37:56.149 --> 37:58.856
He's been doing
really great lately.

37:58.902 --> 38:00.517
We're still trying to
figure out the right way

38:00.570 --> 38:01.980
to talk to him
about all this--

38:02.030 --> 38:04.988
his dad, the execution.

38:05.033 --> 38:06.523
Adrian, honey?

38:06.576 --> 38:08.316
There's someone
here to see you.

38:08.369 --> 38:09.575
Oh.

38:09.621 --> 38:12.237
He's in the backyard.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.297
Adrian's very lucky.

38:27.305 --> 38:30.138
Let's go out
so you can talk to him.

38:35.104 --> 38:37.811
No, Ijust wanted to see him.
Thank you.

38:53.081 --> 38:56.619
He's been drawing again lately.

38:56.626 --> 38:59.459
Since he heard the news
about his father.
