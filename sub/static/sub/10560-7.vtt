00:48.432 --> 00:49.672
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:49.700 --> 00:52.078
the library will be
closing in five minutes.

00:53.837 --> 00:57.080
You found what you were
looking for, Mr. Faber?

00:57.107 --> 00:59.280
I did indeed.

00:59.343 --> 01:01.846
Thank you for pointing
me in the right direction,

01:01.879 --> 01:03.790
Miss Messing.

01:03.847 --> 01:08.455
It's a fine addition to my favorite hobby.

01:08.519 --> 01:11.466
I'm pleased to hear it.

01:11.522 --> 01:14.469
And I'm sure Rose will be as well.

01:34.611 --> 01:35.749
Hello?

01:40.617 --> 01:42.597
Is somebody still here?

01:50.961 --> 01:52.133
Who is it?

01:52.162 --> 01:54.608
This is not funny.

02:08.860 --> 02:09.999
What have you, George?

02:10.027 --> 02:12.201
Sir, a Miss Lucille Messing

02:12.231 --> 02:13.574
didn't arrive for her shift today,

02:13.599 --> 02:16.239
and her landlady says she
didn't return home last night.

02:16.268 --> 02:18.680
I take it this isn't normal
behavior for Miss Messing.

02:18.704 --> 02:19.705
It's not, sir.

02:19.738 --> 02:22.082
I thought it best to telephone you.

02:22.107 --> 02:24.246
So this is where she was last seen.

02:24.276 --> 02:26.017
Were there any signs of a struggle?

02:26.044 --> 02:27.421
No, sir. All the doors were locked.

02:27.446 --> 02:28.686
No sign of forced entry.

02:28.714 --> 02:30.387
- No witnesses?
- None.

02:30.415 --> 02:31.736
The other librarian is on her way.

02:31.750 --> 02:32.751
She's due any minute.

02:32.784 --> 02:35.594
She might be able to shed
some light on the matter.

02:35.621 --> 02:36.691
Oh...

02:36.722 --> 02:39.464
Miss?

02:39.525 --> 02:41.801
You there!

02:45.464 --> 02:48.240
Stop!

02:48.267 --> 02:49.712
Miss!

02:49.735 --> 02:51.715
- Stop! Police!
- Let me go!

02:54.406 --> 02:55.476
Anna?

02:58.477 --> 02:59.478
Hello, William.

02:59.545 --> 03:00.717
Anna.

03:00.746 --> 03:03.556
What the devil are you doing here?

03:03.582 --> 03:05.493
Anna.

03:05.551 --> 03:06.552
You can't be here.

03:06.585 --> 03:08.223
There are people after you.

03:10.088 --> 03:12.659
Why did you come back?

03:12.724 --> 03:14.067
Anna!

03:14.092 --> 03:15.935
William, I'm sorry. I tried.

03:15.961 --> 03:17.304
Really, I did.

03:17.329 --> 03:19.502
I went to Chicago and Boston.

03:19.565 --> 03:20.805
And you come back to Toronto?

03:20.832 --> 03:23.005
What if the Black Hand finds out?

03:23.068 --> 03:24.843
I doubt they even remember I exist.

03:24.903 --> 03:26.246
There is a price on your head.

03:26.271 --> 03:27.272
They'll remember.

03:27.306 --> 03:30.014
And you come back here,
where they tried to kill you?

03:30.075 --> 03:32.578
I've already been here
several months, William.

03:32.611 --> 03:34.181
What?

03:34.246 --> 03:35.526
Honestly, who's going to notice

03:35.581 --> 03:36.855
an anonymous librarian?

03:36.915 --> 03:38.292
Please.

03:38.317 --> 03:40.524
It's the only place I don't feel alone.

03:40.586 --> 03:42.532
You can't stay.

03:42.588 --> 03:44.158
I'm fine.

03:44.189 --> 03:46.328
And what were you doing
at the library anyway?

03:46.358 --> 03:48.429
I hope you don't have an overdue book.

03:48.460 --> 03:50.098
There's a heavy penalty for that.

03:50.128 --> 03:51.698
Very funny.

03:51.763 --> 03:53.037
It's not that simple.

03:53.098 --> 03:56.212
I'm investigating the
disappearance of Lucille Messing.

03:56.268 --> 03:58.214
- Lucille?
- Yes.

03:58.270 --> 04:00.773
She didn't go home last night.

04:00.806 --> 04:02.479
That's not like her.

04:02.507 --> 04:04.316
Do you know of anyone close to her?

04:04.343 --> 04:06.152
Well, she has a fiancé.

04:06.178 --> 04:07.816
And today's Tuesday,

04:07.846 --> 04:10.224
so last night, she'd have
been at choir practice.

04:10.282 --> 04:11.454
Very good.

04:11.483 --> 04:12.723
Where are the practices?

04:12.784 --> 04:15.321
At St. Alban's church, I believe.

04:15.354 --> 04:17.732
Right.

04:17.789 --> 04:18.790
Do you know of anything

04:18.824 --> 04:20.803
that may have been bothering her recently?

04:22.294 --> 04:24.570
William, what if this is all a mistake?

04:24.630 --> 04:26.075
What if the Black Hand have found me,

04:26.131 --> 04:27.735
and they took her by mistake?

04:27.799 --> 04:31.008
Well, we don't know that she's been taken.

04:31.036 --> 04:32.811
She could have disappeared
of her own accord.

04:32.838 --> 04:34.715
It's not something Lucille would do.

04:36.074 --> 04:38.020
What if I am responsible?

04:48.420 --> 04:49.763
It's highly illegal, Inspector.

04:49.821 --> 04:51.027
I'm well aware of the law.

04:51.056 --> 04:52.535
Not to mention immoral.

04:52.557 --> 04:55.037
Teaching contraception is not only a crime.

04:55.060 --> 04:56.061
It's a mortal sin.

04:56.094 --> 04:58.734
As I've said, we'll
look into it, Mr. Wilson.

04:58.764 --> 04:59.834
Now, good day.

05:08.874 --> 05:10.410
Inspector O'Kelly.

05:10.442 --> 05:11.580
To what do I owe the pleasure?

05:11.610 --> 05:13.112
Oh, I just thought I'd drop by

05:13.178 --> 05:14.953
and say how much Station
5 is looking forward

05:15.013 --> 05:17.015
to trouncing your boys
at baseball next week.

05:17.049 --> 05:18.756
It's that time of year again.

05:18.784 --> 05:21.697
What was the score last year? 16-3?

05:21.720 --> 05:23.063
Oh!

05:23.088 --> 05:24.590
My apologies.

05:24.623 --> 05:27.536
Well, I don't think we'll be
putting up a team this year.

05:27.559 --> 05:28.594
We're too busy.

05:28.627 --> 05:30.402
Too busy?

05:30.429 --> 05:33.205
A whole year, and that's the
best you could come up with?

05:33.932 --> 05:36.970
I'm charged with keeping the
citizens of this city safe,

05:37.035 --> 05:40.482
not running around a
playground in knickerbockers.

05:48.380 --> 05:49.654
Lucille Messing?

05:49.715 --> 05:52.662
Yes, she's a member of my choir.

05:52.718 --> 05:55.392
Well, not much of a voice,
but she gave it her all.

05:55.420 --> 05:56.990
How worrisome.

05:57.055 --> 05:58.432
When did you last see her?

05:58.457 --> 06:00.300
Well, she missed practice last night.

06:00.325 --> 06:02.965
- Was that unusual?
- Yes, most unlike her.

06:02.994 --> 06:06.567
She was always punctual,
a most reliable girl.

06:06.598 --> 06:10.569
Do you have any idea what
could have happened to her?

06:10.602 --> 06:14.641
Is it possible she
disappeared of her own accord?

06:17.776 --> 06:18.948
Mr. Trevor?

06:18.977 --> 06:21.014
You should talk to her fiancé,

06:21.079 --> 06:22.649
Geoffrey Coville.

06:22.681 --> 06:24.991
- Why is that?
- Oh, he just...

06:25.016 --> 06:26.154
had a way about him.

06:26.184 --> 06:28.186
Made me uneasy.

06:28.253 --> 06:29.254
How so?

06:29.287 --> 06:32.496
He was so... superior.

06:32.524 --> 06:33.885
It was always something of a puzzle

06:33.925 --> 06:37.372
as to why a quiet young woman like Lucille

06:37.429 --> 06:38.874
was engaged to him.

06:42.634 --> 06:43.874
Are you sure this is the address.

06:43.935 --> 06:45.437
Mr. Wilson gave the Inspector?

06:45.470 --> 06:46.471
I don't know, Henry.

06:46.505 --> 06:47.882
All I know is that this is the address

06:47.939 --> 06:49.145
the Inspector gave me.

06:49.174 --> 06:50.175
This doesn't seem right.

06:50.208 --> 06:51.648
I mean, shouldn't we be investigating

06:51.676 --> 06:54.714
some sort of medical facility?

06:54.780 --> 06:58.284
Who knows what goes on
behind closed doors, Henry?

06:58.316 --> 07:00.694
Who knows?

07:03.021 --> 07:05.524
Retraining from relations during this time

07:05.557 --> 07:07.628
will reduce the likelihood of pregnancy.

07:07.659 --> 07:10.663
However, a much surer
way to prevent conception

07:10.695 --> 07:12.641
is the barrier method.

07:12.664 --> 07:14.234
This is a diaphragm.

07:14.299 --> 07:16.836
While no device can promise certainty,

07:16.868 --> 07:19.212
the diaphragm is a much more...

07:19.237 --> 07:21.239
Dr. Ogden?

07:21.306 --> 07:23.877
Constable Crabtree.

07:27.145 --> 07:29.265
I take it you're here on
official business, Constable.

07:29.314 --> 07:31.089
Yes, your gathering has
come to the attention

07:31.149 --> 07:32.651
of the Toronto Constabulary.

07:32.684 --> 07:33.754
I see.

07:33.819 --> 07:35.821
Advocating contraception,
Doctor, is illegal,

07:35.854 --> 07:37.595
as I'm sure you know.

07:37.656 --> 07:38.896
It pains me to do this,

07:38.924 --> 07:40.562
but I've been asked to arrest you.

07:40.592 --> 07:42.868
You'll have to come down to
the station house with us.

07:46.765 --> 07:49.268
Are the other women free to leave?

07:49.334 --> 07:51.041
They're attending an illegal gathering.

07:51.069 --> 07:52.412
Constable, please.

07:52.437 --> 07:55.247
They're here at my invitation.

07:55.273 --> 07:56.911
George.

07:56.942 --> 07:59.354
Some of them risk a beating
if they're found out.

08:00.712 --> 08:02.453
Well, they're free to go, then.

08:02.514 --> 08:03.618
Ladies, I'm sorry.

08:03.682 --> 08:05.855
Could you please see yourselves out?

08:05.884 --> 08:07.090
Thank you.

08:09.387 --> 08:10.457
Ladies.

08:15.460 --> 08:17.269
Well, you could always work at Station 4.

08:17.295 --> 08:19.775
They're a bit delicate
for the streets of Toronto,

08:19.798 --> 08:21.800
but good chaps, nonetheless.

08:21.867 --> 08:23.608
And I wouldn't call them Miss Nancy's,

08:23.635 --> 08:25.046
though, some might.

08:25.070 --> 08:27.607
If a friendly game of
baseball isn't to their liking,

08:27.639 --> 08:30.415
maybe a nice game of marbles or hopscotch.

08:30.442 --> 08:32.479
Right! That's enough out of you, O'Kelly.

08:32.544 --> 08:34.386
Ah, Brackenreid. I didn't see you there.

08:34.412 --> 08:36.085
Station 4 accepts the challenge.

08:36.114 --> 08:37.592
And we won't just play against you;

08:37.616 --> 08:39.220
We'll bloody well beat you.

08:39.251 --> 08:40.662
I very much doubt that.

08:40.719 --> 08:42.823
Care to put your money where your mouth is?

08:42.888 --> 08:44.333
I'd be delighted.

08:45.490 --> 08:46.662
$10.

08:47.659 --> 08:49.639
Done.

08:56.167 --> 08:57.840
Mr. Coville, do you have any idea

08:57.903 --> 09:00.008
of your fiancée's whereabouts?

09:00.071 --> 09:01.448
She didn't go home last night?

09:01.473 --> 09:03.282
That's not possible.

09:03.308 --> 09:05.151
Could there have been a family matter?

09:05.176 --> 09:06.621
I am her family.

09:06.645 --> 09:08.921
Lucille's parents are deceased.

09:08.947 --> 09:11.826
- Any other family?
- None that I know of.

09:11.850 --> 09:13.852
Mr. Coville, when was the last time

09:13.919 --> 09:15.455
you saw your fiancée?

09:15.487 --> 09:18.297
Yesterday. We met for lunch.

09:18.323 --> 09:20.496
Did you notice anything unusual?

09:20.525 --> 09:24.132
Actually, yes. She was
wearing a blue dress.

09:25.964 --> 09:27.637
That was unusual?

09:27.666 --> 09:29.873
Lucille is quite a reserved person.

09:29.935 --> 09:32.347
She thought blue was exceptionally daring.

09:32.370 --> 09:35.180
That's why I encouraged
her work at the library,

09:35.206 --> 09:38.050
to see if she could break out of her shell.

09:38.109 --> 09:41.682
Please, find her, Detective.

09:46.618 --> 09:49.690
Sir, we've received bad
news regarding Miss Messing.

09:49.721 --> 09:52.725
A hiker found her body early this morning.

10:16.514 --> 10:17.993
Miss Messing was strangled.

10:18.016 --> 10:21.054
I believe a cord of some kind was used.

10:21.086 --> 10:22.929
Though, there is one particular mark

10:22.988 --> 10:25.400
that is decidedly darker than the others.

10:25.490 --> 10:29.097
Here. Back of the neck.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.867
Perhaps pressure from a thumb,

10:30.895 --> 10:34.240
if someone grabbed her from behind.

10:34.265 --> 10:35.869
Hmm.

10:35.900 --> 10:38.676
- Any other bruising?
- No.

10:38.703 --> 10:41.775
Were there any signs of... interference?

10:41.840 --> 10:44.582
It appears her maidenhood is still intact.

10:44.609 --> 10:45.883
Well, that's strange.

10:45.910 --> 10:47.947
An innocent young woman
is abducted, killed,

10:48.013 --> 10:51.790
and yet no liberties
were taken on her body.

10:51.850 --> 10:53.761
You say our woman was a librarian,

10:53.785 --> 10:55.696
shy, churchgoing.

10:55.720 --> 10:56.721
All who knew her

10:56.755 --> 10:59.235
characterized her as reserved, cautious.

10:59.257 --> 11:00.736
Take a look at this.

11:10.969 --> 11:12.243
Not something you would see

11:12.270 --> 11:14.750
on a woman of reserved character.

11:18.977 --> 11:21.651
It's rather beautiful, isn't it?

11:21.713 --> 11:24.717
I understand tattooing has
become something of a fad

11:24.749 --> 11:27.958
in England among the aristocracy.

11:27.986 --> 11:29.727
Why might she do this?

11:29.754 --> 11:31.461
I suppose it would depend

11:31.489 --> 11:35.562
on exactly who your Miss Messings truly is.

11:35.593 --> 11:37.334
What are you suggesting?

11:37.395 --> 11:39.636
Consider the placement of the rose.

11:39.664 --> 11:42.167
A simple lifting of her
skirt above the ankle

11:42.233 --> 11:45.806
and it was there for all the world to see.

11:45.837 --> 11:47.441
I would suggest

11:47.472 --> 11:50.480
that there is more to your
librarian than meets the eye.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.020
I'd only known her a short while,

11:54.047 --> 11:56.960
but she showed no signs
of having a wild side.

11:58.685 --> 12:01.222
So the Black Hand weren't
involved after all.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.530
That is some relief, Anna.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.695
No, Lucille Messings murder came about

12:05.725 --> 12:07.432
as a result of something in her past,

12:07.460 --> 12:09.440
not her association with you.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.806
Murdoch, do you have a...

12:11.865 --> 12:13.970
Miss Fulford.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.980
What are you doing back here in Toronto?

12:16.036 --> 12:18.277
Inspector, that's no longer her name.

12:18.304 --> 12:21.251
Ah, well, Miss whatever-your-name-is,

12:21.274 --> 12:23.982
being here is like signing
your own death warrant.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.081
Well, I'll take my chance, Inspector.

12:26.112 --> 12:28.422
Mm.

12:28.448 --> 12:29.586
Murdoch, if you have a moment,

12:29.616 --> 12:31.376
perhaps you could spare
a word for Dr. Ogden.

12:31.384 --> 12:34.160
Julia? She's here?

12:34.220 --> 12:36.666
She certainly is.

12:37.724 --> 12:40.295
Julia, let me get the
Constable to unlock this,

12:40.326 --> 12:41.634
so we can speak properly.

12:41.661 --> 12:44.835
Constable Crabtree refused to lock it.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.639
Please come in.

12:48.334 --> 12:51.144
These cells are for criminals.

12:53.006 --> 12:55.646
I understand that.

12:55.675 --> 12:57.018
What I'm less sure of is

12:57.077 --> 13:00.650
why counseling impoverished
women is a crime.

13:00.680 --> 13:03.160
You were teaching methods of contraception.

13:03.183 --> 13:06.653
I was simply following my conscience.

13:06.686 --> 13:07.687
I'm sorry, William,

13:07.754 --> 13:09.529
but since I began my own practice,

13:09.589 --> 13:11.796
I see the same thing day after day.

13:11.825 --> 13:16.274
Women run off their feet,
caring for too many children.

13:16.296 --> 13:20.438
It's my duty as a doctor
to do something about it.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.708
Julia, I admire your principles.

13:22.769 --> 13:24.271
It's not about principles.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.148
It's about the health
of women and children.

13:27.173 --> 13:30.620
And you aren't going to
change any of that in here.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.283
Go home, Julia.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.122
I will not.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.128
I won't be leaving until
I've had an opportunity

13:37.150 --> 13:38.720
to argue my case in front of a judge.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.787
A case you will lose.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.322
Then I'll lose.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.356
And if that happens,

13:43.389 --> 13:45.130
you will be facing two years in prison

13:45.158 --> 13:47.832
in surroundings much less
comfortable than this.

13:49.229 --> 13:50.799
You're being stubborn.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.702
I like to think determined.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.221
Here you go, boys.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.059
Station 4 is gonna be fielding

14:12.085 --> 14:13.860
a top-notch crackerjack baseball team

14:13.887 --> 14:15.093
at this year's police games.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.362
But, sir, Armstrong is on leave.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.427
- So what?
- Well, he's our pitcher.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.870
After last year's
debacle? Not bloody likely.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.533
I've nominated Higgins.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.338
Sir, no. I...

14:25.365 --> 14:27.538
I'm on third base, sir.
I'm the third baseman.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.569
Then we need a new third baseman.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.243
Oh, no. I don't think so, sir.

14:36.276 --> 14:37.414
We need you, Murdoch.

14:37.443 --> 14:40.117
I've not played much baseball, sir.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.250
All hands on deck.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.783
You'll be a quick study.

14:42.849 --> 14:44.123
That's the spirit.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.721
Oh, and this year, we're
going to be practicing.

14:46.753 --> 14:48.630
Oh, that's an excellent idea, sir.

14:48.688 --> 14:50.964
Now, what are you lot
doing standing around?

14:51.024 --> 14:52.435
Get back to work.

14:52.458 --> 14:55.132
And, Higgins, as our pitcher,

14:55.195 --> 14:56.265
you're our leader.

14:56.296 --> 14:59.971
You hold in your hands the
fate of the station's honor.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.979
Now, be a good lad and put the kettle on.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.707
It's reassuring to see how
seriously the Constabulary

15:06.739 --> 15:08.582
is treating the death of my fiancée.

15:08.608 --> 15:12.146
Mr. Coville, it's my number one priority.

15:12.212 --> 15:13.247
Clearly.

15:17.050 --> 15:21.157
You characterized your fiancée
as a shy, restrained woman.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.098
She was that.

15:23.122 --> 15:25.227
Then why did she have a tattoo?

15:28.094 --> 15:29.129
The red rose.

15:29.162 --> 15:33.508
It snaked from her
ankle to almost mid-calf.

15:33.566 --> 15:34.806
I don't believe you.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.313
Well, I've seen it with my own eyes.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.089
How could you not have known?

15:45.111 --> 15:47.455
You told me the two of you were engaged.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.187
We weren't haven't relations,

15:49.249 --> 15:50.694
if that's what you're insinuating.

15:50.750 --> 15:54.789
Lucille was a good Christian woman.

15:54.821 --> 15:56.960
It's a very uncommon adornment.

15:56.990 --> 15:57.991
How long have you...

15:58.024 --> 15:59.594
I would appreciate it if
you would spend your time

15:59.626 --> 16:01.333
trying to find my fiancée's killer

16:01.361 --> 16:05.207
instead of besmirching her character.

16:05.265 --> 16:08.144
Typical of the police, I suppose.

16:08.167 --> 16:11.546
You enjoy wallowing in filth, don't you?

16:19.279 --> 16:21.156
- William.
- Anna.

16:21.180 --> 16:22.818
I was just on my way to see you.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.556
I didn't think anything of it at the time,

16:24.617 --> 16:25.618
but a few weeks ago,

16:25.652 --> 16:28.223
I overheard Lucille having
a conversation with a man,

16:28.288 --> 16:30.063
and he insisted that he knew her

16:30.123 --> 16:31.500
and wanted to renew their acquaintance.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.162
He was really quite brazen.

16:33.192 --> 16:35.229
And what was Miss Messings reaction?

16:35.295 --> 16:37.571
Well, she told him he was mistaken.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.234
Well, could you describe him?

16:39.299 --> 16:41.745
I could if I saw him again.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.075
Do you think she knew him?

16:43.136 --> 16:45.912
Well, at the time, no, but now...

16:45.972 --> 16:47.144
Right.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.379
Where are we going?

16:48.408 --> 16:51.719
We are off to Toronto's only tattoo studio.

17:13.499 --> 17:17.071
I remember. Three sessions.

17:17.103 --> 17:19.515
A very unusual young woman.

17:21.607 --> 17:24.109
It was a painful session,

17:24.176 --> 17:27.021
but she endured it without a whimper.

17:28.448 --> 17:31.793
She was my only female customer.

17:31.851 --> 17:34.730
Mr. Sato, did you design this rose for her?

17:34.754 --> 17:37.701
No, it was from a book.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.863
Do you recall the name of the book?

17:39.892 --> 17:42.031
No.

17:42.061 --> 17:46.203
Mr. Sato, you say she was
your only female customer.

17:46.232 --> 17:50.271
Did Miss Messing say why
she might want such a thing?

17:50.303 --> 17:51.941
I didn't inquire,

17:51.971 --> 17:54.918
but people often employ my services

17:54.941 --> 17:57.615
to mark a significant milestone.

18:00.947 --> 18:01.982
Thank you.

18:07.253 --> 18:10.325
Are you sure you wouldn't
like a tattoo, William?

18:10.390 --> 18:11.562
I don't think so.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.127
Be our little secret.

18:22.402 --> 18:23.676
Thank you, Constable.

18:23.736 --> 18:26.740
Oh, I'm sure we won't be
keeping you long, Doctor.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.754
Hello, George.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.757
Constable Crabtree.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.419
Dr. Grace. Pleased to see you.

18:37.917 --> 18:38.918
Dr. Ogden.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.431
You are just about the
bravest woman I've ever met.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.956
Oh, well, hardly.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.866
I was simply doing my job as a physician.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.460
You were doing much more than that.

18:46.492 --> 18:48.494
You were promising emancipation,

18:48.528 --> 18:49.632
allowing women the chance

18:49.662 --> 18:52.939
to have some measure of
control over their destiny.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.468
I'm ready to plan a rally
to protest your imprisonment.

18:55.501 --> 18:57.606
Well, there's no need for that.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.981
You misunderstand. It's not for you.

19:00.006 --> 19:01.349
It's for the right of women

19:01.374 --> 19:03.217
to choose whether or not to conceive.

19:03.276 --> 19:06.814
In fact, a woman of your
position unfairly jailed

19:06.846 --> 19:09.520
shines a light on the injustice.

19:09.549 --> 19:12.393
I appreciate your support, Dr. Grace.

19:12.452 --> 19:15.558
Sir, I've discovered something
that may be of relevance.

19:15.621 --> 19:18.033
We located a patron who
last checked out a book

19:18.057 --> 19:19.502
the night Miss Messing disappeared.

19:19.525 --> 19:22.335
- Ah, did you get a name?
- Yes, sir.

19:22.361 --> 19:24.398
Little Friends With Feathers.

19:24.464 --> 19:25.499
The patron, George.

19:25.531 --> 19:28.535
Yes, of course... ah, Stanley Faber, sir.

19:28.568 --> 19:31.981
Uh, she appeared a charming young woman.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.415
Though, I never knew her name.

19:33.473 --> 19:35.976
Uh, Miss... Miss Messing, you say?

19:36.008 --> 19:37.351
That's right.

19:37.376 --> 19:40.983
And you saw her at the
library two days ago?

19:41.013 --> 19:43.516
I, uh... I go there to research.

19:43.549 --> 19:47.053
- I'm an amateur ornithologist.
- That's right.

19:47.086 --> 19:51.831
And you took out a book,
Little Friends With Feathers.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.895
That's right.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.563
Tell me, Mr. Faber,

19:56.596 --> 20:01.602
do you stay at the library
late on a regular basis?

20:01.667 --> 20:06.173
Not more than once a week, sometimes twice.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.412
So fairly regularly, then?

20:08.441 --> 20:13.686
And yet you claim you have
never spoken to Miss Messing?

20:13.713 --> 20:15.420
No, I never...

20:15.448 --> 20:17.394
is this an interrogation?

20:17.416 --> 20:19.953
It most certainly is.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.930
Mr. Faber, you may be the last person

20:21.954 --> 20:25.925
to have seen Miss Messing alive.

20:30.263 --> 20:33.039
I just received your
message. I was in Buffalo.

20:33.065 --> 20:36.979
I tried speaking with her,
but Julia's a determined woman.

20:37.036 --> 20:39.744
Yes, my wife does know her mind.

20:39.772 --> 20:42.275
Well, conviction is an admirable quality.

20:44.544 --> 20:48.993
I'll leave you two. The door's open.

20:49.048 --> 20:52.120
Hello, Darcy.

20:52.151 --> 20:54.825
I thought I'd surprise you, arriving early,

20:54.887 --> 20:56.491
but it appears you've trumped me.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.126
Hi.

20:58.157 --> 20:59.932
Julia, I need you to come home.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.996
- Darcy...
- Julia.

21:02.061 --> 21:03.301
I understand your position,

21:03.329 --> 21:06.071
but you won't win an
argument inside a jail cell.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.169
Please trust me.

21:08.234 --> 21:09.838
This is something I care about.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.506
I know that you do.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.778
But let's join the fight.

21:13.806 --> 21:14.807
Together.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.581
Please.

21:18.344 --> 21:21.416
Inspector Brackenreid's
agreed to look the other way.

21:27.954 --> 21:32.027
All right, I'll come home,
but I haven't given up.

21:32.091 --> 21:33.331
Out of my office!

21:33.359 --> 21:35.239
I'm telling you today
what I told you yesterday,

21:35.261 --> 21:37.537
what I'll probably tell you
tomorrow and the day after that.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.634
I have no bleeding comments!

21:41.467 --> 21:44.846
I'm being hounded by
reporters thirsting for blood.

21:44.870 --> 21:46.816
What's the progress on
this librarian killer?

21:46.839 --> 21:48.318
Librarian killer?

21:48.341 --> 21:50.116
That's what they've coined him.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.222
Oh, and they've heard about
the young woman's tattoo.

21:52.278 --> 21:53.552
I don't know how.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.615
We need to sort this, and soon, Murdoch.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.685
Yes, sir.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.628
Sir, telephone message.

22:01.387 --> 22:03.560
Look, I found this in
Lucille's desk drawer.

22:03.623 --> 22:07.036
Oh, I prefer much more scientific texts.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.299
Look at the bookmark.

22:12.231 --> 22:14.142
Written with a calligraphy pen,

22:14.166 --> 22:15.975
very elaborate hand.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.039
Does this number sequence
mean anything to you?

22:18.070 --> 22:19.208
Well, it looks like the numbers

22:19.238 --> 22:20.717
we use on library books.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.151
The Dewey Decimal system

22:22.174 --> 22:24.984
organizes book titles into ten categories

22:25.011 --> 22:26.217
and then subdivides.

22:26.245 --> 22:28.384
Each successive number narrows the field.

22:28.414 --> 22:30.485
7 denotes arts and recreation.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.860
709. Art history.

22:34.654 --> 22:35.860
Lucky guess.

22:35.888 --> 22:38.562
What don't you know about?

22:38.591 --> 22:41.003
I have a very curious mind,

22:41.027 --> 22:42.028
always have.

22:42.061 --> 22:44.200
Well, that's a very attractive quality.

22:44.230 --> 22:47.677
Most men have curious
hands and little else.

22:47.700 --> 22:48.701
Well...

22:48.734 --> 22:53.046
Let's see what The Secret
Heart has to tell us.

22:58.177 --> 22:59.212
235.

23:00.579 --> 23:03.856
235.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.226
Here.

23:07.053 --> 23:11.866
Mm, but 67 isn't part of
Melville Dewey's system.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.962
Try page 67?

23:22.301 --> 23:25.805
She looks like Lucille.

23:25.871 --> 23:29.751
And she's holding a rose.

23:29.775 --> 23:31.880
This must be the illustration

23:31.911 --> 23:34.289
that Lucille asked Mr. Sato to copy.

23:39.618 --> 23:43.156
"Devil."

23:43.222 --> 23:44.667
"Drum."

23:44.724 --> 23:46.635
Do you think that means anything?

23:49.662 --> 23:52.268
The Devil's Drum.

23:52.298 --> 23:54.175
It would appear your friend Lucille

23:54.233 --> 23:55.576
strayed a great distance

23:55.601 --> 23:58.980
from the confines of the
Toronto Public Library.

24:04.477 --> 24:06.320
I admire you speaking on
behalf of the city's poor,

24:06.345 --> 24:07.619
Mr. Lamott.

24:07.646 --> 24:09.421
Proper nutrition is critical.

24:09.448 --> 24:10.620
As chair of the board,

24:10.649 --> 24:14.153
I feel the hospital has a
duty not just to treat illness

24:14.186 --> 24:16.632
but to try and prevent
it in the first place.

24:16.655 --> 24:17.929
A disease like rickets

24:17.957 --> 24:20.301
could be eradicated with better nutrition.

24:20.326 --> 24:22.169
You must see a lot of terrible cases

24:22.194 --> 24:24.504
in your private practice, Mrs. Garland.

24:24.530 --> 24:26.635
It's still Dr. Ogden.

24:26.665 --> 24:28.611
And, yes, I do.

24:28.634 --> 24:32.172
The mothers of this city
bear an enormous burden.

24:32.204 --> 24:35.378
In caring for their children?

24:35.441 --> 24:37.887
And bearing children year after year,

24:37.943 --> 24:39.320
even as their own health fails.

24:39.345 --> 24:41.052
Quite so, and in their dwellings.

24:41.113 --> 24:43.559
What do you suggest, Dr. Ogden,

24:43.616 --> 24:45.357
we tell them to stop having them?

24:46.552 --> 24:48.657
If contraception we're not illegal,

24:48.687 --> 24:50.860
families could make those
decisions for themselves.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.894
You mean women could?

24:55.194 --> 24:57.174
I suppose I do,

24:57.196 --> 25:00.541
if only to benefit the health
of the family as a whole.

25:00.566 --> 25:02.637
Good way to prevent illness,

25:02.668 --> 25:03.669
is it not?

25:06.972 --> 25:08.349
Shall we?

25:08.374 --> 25:10.854
Oh.

25:18.818 --> 25:21.924
Your wife is a very spirited woman.

25:21.987 --> 25:23.398
Yes, Julie is wonderful

25:23.422 --> 25:25.561
and not shy about expressing her opinions.

25:25.591 --> 25:28.663
They're certainly very modern.

25:28.694 --> 25:31.903
You have your hands full
there, I suspect, Garland.

26:14.273 --> 26:15.650
Oh, come on, love.

26:15.708 --> 26:16.743
. I'm pus)'-

26:16.775 --> 26:18.083
This is-l didn't get her name.

26:18.110 --> 26:19.646
She won't tell me her name.

26:19.712 --> 26:21.817
- Hello.
- Come on, love.

26:21.881 --> 26:24.623
Yeah. We're not
- Oh, we're friendly types.

26:24.650 --> 26:26.288
Hey, we'll buy you a beer, you know?

26:26.318 --> 26:27.922
- We'll get you a drink.
- Yeah, come on.

26:27.953 --> 26:30.797
- What do you say?
- Be a sport.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.734
Is everything all right, gentlemen?

26:39.632 --> 26:40.838
Anna.

26:40.900 --> 26:43.005
You think I've never been in a bar before?

26:43.068 --> 26:44.604
What are you doing here?

26:44.637 --> 26:46.139
You should be in hiding.

26:46.171 --> 26:48.447
You need my help to find the murderer.

26:48.474 --> 26:50.511
- Oh, do I?
- Yes.

26:50.576 --> 26:52.146
I'm the only one who saw the man

26:52.177 --> 26:55.647
talking to Lucille in the library.

26:55.681 --> 26:56.751
Very well.

26:56.782 --> 26:59.524
Then you let me know if
you happen to see him.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.526
You know, you're the only woman in this bar

27:05.591 --> 27:10.370
who isn't engaged in
the entertainment of men.

27:10.429 --> 27:13.000
Am I not entertaining?

27:13.032 --> 27:15.672
Can I get you anything, sir?

27:15.701 --> 27:18.272
Yes, I would like some information, please.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.215
I'm just here to serve drinks.

27:20.272 --> 27:23.845
Miss, if there is gaming
going on in that back room,

27:23.876 --> 27:26.789
I will be compelled to
shut down this establishment

27:26.812 --> 27:28.849
indefinitely.

27:28.881 --> 27:30.883
Now...

27:30.950 --> 27:33.226
have you ever seen this young woman?

27:36.322 --> 27:37.460
I've seen her...

27:37.489 --> 27:39.696
a month or so back,

27:39.725 --> 27:41.363
not our usual clientele.

27:41.393 --> 27:44.067
- Was she with anyone?
- No, she came in alone.

27:44.129 --> 27:45.733
That's why I remember her.

27:45.798 --> 27:48.210
She looked like a lady.

27:48.233 --> 27:49.974
Then I thought something different.

27:50.002 --> 27:51.174
Why do you say that?

27:51.203 --> 27:53.809
A gentleman joined her and
ordered them both a drink.

27:55.140 --> 27:56.881
- Were they together very long?
- No.

27:56.909 --> 27:59.549
She left a short while later.

27:59.578 --> 28:04.049
Funny. Didn't take her for a doxy.

28:04.083 --> 28:06.893
Had you ever seen this man before?

28:06.919 --> 28:11.026
Never saw him before or since.

28:11.056 --> 28:12.865
I would very much like to hear from you

28:12.891 --> 28:14.427
if you ever see this man again.

28:14.493 --> 28:15.528
Oh.

28:17.563 --> 28:18.871
What is it?

28:18.897 --> 28:20.342
Nothing. Nothing.

28:20.366 --> 28:22.505
Nothing.

28:22.534 --> 28:25.014
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.448
Shall we?

28:44.456 --> 28:45.958
There's somebody following us.

28:46.025 --> 28:47.936
I know. Keep walking.

28:53.532 --> 28:54.567
Why are you following us?

28:54.600 --> 28:56.136
I heard you asking about that woman.

28:56.201 --> 28:58.807
I was. What do you know about her?

28:58.871 --> 29:00.817
I've got a little sister to look after.

29:00.873 --> 29:01.943
Mother too.

29:01.974 --> 29:03.078
Upstanding citizens

29:03.108 --> 29:05.486
usually volunteer
information to the police.

29:05.544 --> 29:08.047
Oh, give the boy a few pennies, William.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.117
Fine.

29:11.150 --> 29:12.629
Let's have it.

29:12.651 --> 29:13.755
I don't know much about her,

29:13.786 --> 29:16.323
but the man she took
off with, he's a regular,

29:16.388 --> 29:17.458
name of Carling.

29:17.489 --> 29:20.436
Helped him home once after
he had a few too many.

29:20.459 --> 29:23.167
Carling.

29:23.228 --> 29:24.263
Thank you.

29:24.296 --> 29:25.775
It's nights like this

29:25.798 --> 29:27.675
that make me miss my days in the morgue.

29:27.733 --> 29:30.111
Yes, the hospital board
do make for lively company,

29:30.135 --> 29:31.580
don't they?

29:31.603 --> 29:33.446
- That's one way to put it.
- Mm.

29:33.472 --> 29:37.318
I suppose Roger Lamott does go on.

29:37.342 --> 29:38.980
You made quite an impression on him.

29:39.011 --> 29:42.185
Me? A married woman? I'm flattered.

29:42.247 --> 29:44.853
Your ideas, darling.

29:44.917 --> 29:47.591
My ideas or my opinions?

29:47.619 --> 29:48.962
The whole issue of contraception

29:48.987 --> 29:50.022
is very controversial.

29:50.089 --> 29:52.763
It's a religious affront to many people.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.293
You do remember who it is you married,

29:54.326 --> 29:55.327
don't you, Darcy?

29:55.360 --> 29:57.601
I'm not exactly what you'd
call a shrinking violet?

29:57.629 --> 29:59.040
Of course I do.

29:59.098 --> 30:00.941
And I admire your spirit and conviction

30:00.966 --> 30:02.707
more than any man alive, but...

30:03.936 --> 30:05.973
But?

30:06.004 --> 30:09.213
They're considering making
me head of the hospital.

30:10.342 --> 30:12.652
That's wonderful news! Congratulations.

30:12.678 --> 30:14.021
Now, I said considering.

30:14.046 --> 30:16.322
Um, nothings been officially decided.

30:16.348 --> 30:19.795
But until it has...

30:19.818 --> 30:21.320
You would like your opinionated wife

30:21.353 --> 30:23.959
to keep her own counsel.

30:23.989 --> 30:28.165
Is it so much of a compromise, Julia?

30:30.129 --> 30:32.575
I so want you to get the position.

30:35.634 --> 30:36.738
Right.

30:36.802 --> 30:38.975
Pretend we're lovers on a stroll.

30:42.708 --> 30:45.848
Oh, this Mr. Carling
surely is a married man.

30:45.878 --> 30:47.516
Hard to believe.

30:47.546 --> 30:49.685
Oh, now, who's the naive one?

30:49.715 --> 30:52.559
No, I don't mean his
actions. I mean Lucille's.

30:52.584 --> 30:54.086
Maybe she didn't know.

30:54.153 --> 30:55.188
Or didn't care.

31:00.759 --> 31:02.500
That's him, the man from the library,

31:02.528 --> 31:05.737
the one who insisted he knew Lucille.

31:05.764 --> 31:08.438
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.275
Right.

31:10.335 --> 31:11.678
Can you see yourself home?

31:11.703 --> 31:13.273
I think I can manage that.

31:13.338 --> 31:15.079
All right.

31:20.279 --> 31:22.146
Oh, Mr. Carling.

31:22.147 --> 31:25.094
I didn't know she was dead.

31:25.117 --> 31:27.597
What a waste.

31:27.619 --> 31:31.465
I was hoping to see her again.
We had unfinished business.

31:31.523 --> 31:35.198
There was something special about that one.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.079
She invited me to join her.

31:49.641 --> 31:51.382
She chose me.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.219
She told me to call her Rose.

32:02.955 --> 32:04.593
Her note was an invitation

32:04.623 --> 32:06.830
to a rendezvous later that same evening.

32:06.892 --> 32:08.098
Did you go?

32:08.126 --> 32:10.333
What do you think, Detective?

32:11.830 --> 32:13.810
Was there a discussion of payment?

32:13.832 --> 32:16.904
That wasn't the nature of the encounter.

32:26.011 --> 32:28.013
She was a vision.

32:39.291 --> 32:40.929
She said...

32:42.027 --> 32:43.700
Undress me.

33:02.214 --> 33:04.194
But finally...

33:14.693 --> 33:16.502
Get out.

33:20.799 --> 33:22.574
Not quite what you were expecting.

33:22.634 --> 33:24.341
I would say not.

33:26.305 --> 33:27.750
And did you?

33:27.806 --> 33:29.547
Sorry?

33:29.574 --> 33:31.247
Leave. Did you leave?

33:31.310 --> 33:34.484
Of course. Lam a gentleman, Detective.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.220
And that was the last time you saw her?

33:36.248 --> 33:39.559
Yes, I never saw her
again. You have my word.

33:39.584 --> 33:42.861
And your word isn't worth
very much, Mr. Carling.

33:42.888 --> 33:45.698
You were seen with Miss
Messing at the public library

33:45.724 --> 33:48.330
trying to renew your acquaintance.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.738
Why would you ask the question
if you already know the answer?

33:50.762 --> 33:52.002
To see if you would be inclined

33:52.030 --> 33:54.510
to lie to the police.

33:54.533 --> 33:55.841
Very well.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.074
I saw Rose in the street
looking entirely different

33:58.103 --> 33:59.704
than the woman I met in The Devil's Drum.

33:59.705 --> 34:01.912
That's when you followed
her into the library.

34:01.940 --> 34:04.079
Wouldn't you?

34:04.109 --> 34:06.715
Mysterious woman like that,

34:06.745 --> 34:10.716
who wouldn't follow her
to the ends of the earth?

34:17.789 --> 34:19.860
Cooperstown's finest, son. Get used to it.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.098
Finest horsehide in the land.

34:23.261 --> 34:24.342
Give it your best, Henry.

34:24.362 --> 34:25.603
Give it some salt and pepper.

34:25.630 --> 34:27.074
Salt and pepper?

34:27.099 --> 34:28.703
It's a sporting expression.

34:31.870 --> 34:32.905
Oh, come on, Henry.

34:32.938 --> 34:34.578
You've got to put some mustard on it, man,

34:34.606 --> 34:36.051
like this.

34:37.109 --> 34:39.054
Oh, my gosh.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.119
Uh...

34:45.917 --> 34:47.260
Begging your pardon, sir.

34:47.284 --> 34:48.992
"Begging my... "

34:49.054 --> 34:51.159
Bloody hell, Crabtree. That was brilliant.

34:51.223 --> 34:52.862
That was the fastest pitch I've ever seen.

34:52.891 --> 34:53.995
It was like lightning.

34:54.059 --> 34:55.833
What position do you play?

34:55.893 --> 34:57.805
Second base.

34:57.829 --> 35:00.309
Higgins, second base.

35:00.332 --> 35:03.404
Crabtree, you're our new pitcher.

35:09.007 --> 35:12.181
Are you telling me that
Lucille had an alter ego?

35:12.244 --> 35:13.780
A woman with a tattoo

35:13.812 --> 35:16.816
who solicited strange men in a tavern?

35:16.848 --> 35:18.486
So it would appear.

35:18.517 --> 35:22.431
Then the woman that I
thought I knew doesn't exist.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.661
It would seem that I have
narrowly escaped marriage

35:24.689 --> 35:26.532
to a trollop.

35:26.591 --> 35:29.094
She was your fiancée, sir.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.936
Are you finished?

35:34.132 --> 35:36.544
I'll let you get back to your mourning.

35:37.669 --> 35:41.549
How am I to mourn the death
of a stranger, Detective?

35:43.842 --> 35:45.685
You'll inform me if
you're going out of town,

35:45.710 --> 35:47.621
Mr. Coville?

35:47.646 --> 35:49.216
I am a suspect?

35:49.281 --> 35:52.819
I'd like to be informed
if you plan to travel.

35:55.020 --> 35:56.829
How did you pick up
your technique, Crabtree?

35:56.855 --> 35:58.163
Well, it's funny you should ask, sir.

35:58.190 --> 36:01.069
My aunt Nettle's farm up
in Haileybury was set upon

36:01.126 --> 36:04.005
by a plague of vermin
of biblical proportions.

36:04.029 --> 36:05.372
I was a young lad at the time,

36:05.397 --> 36:06.876
not yet entrusted with firearms,

36:06.898 --> 36:08.673
so I took to eradicating the little beasts

36:08.700 --> 36:10.179
by hurling stones at them.

36:10.202 --> 36:11.203
Oh.

36:11.236 --> 36:12.806
Sir.

36:12.838 --> 36:13.839
Ah.

36:13.872 --> 36:15.909
- Reporting for duty.
- Good, good.

36:15.974 --> 36:17.817
There's a desk waiting
for you at the station.

36:17.843 --> 36:19.823
- Good to be aboard.
- Good to have you.

36:21.346 --> 36:22.916
Who's that fellow?

36:22.981 --> 36:24.517
A new recruit to Station 4.

36:24.549 --> 36:25.687
I swore him in yesterday.

36:25.717 --> 36:27.924
Much experience in law enforcement, sir?

36:27.986 --> 36:29.397
None whatsoever,

36:29.421 --> 36:31.765
but he played professional
baseball for 12 years.

36:31.823 --> 36:34.167
Sir, a ringer? Is that necessary?

36:34.192 --> 36:36.433
I thought we were doing rather well.

36:36.495 --> 36:38.941
We may be doing rather well, Crabtree,

36:38.997 --> 36:40.738
but I'm from Yorkshire.

36:40.765 --> 36:41.835
I intend to win.

36:50.542 --> 36:52.544
Will I do'?

36:52.577 --> 36:54.887
Just let me.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.524
We can't have the new administrator

36:58.550 --> 37:00.791
of the Victoria Hospital for Sick Children

37:00.852 --> 37:02.024
with his tie askew.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.431
Mm, well, I haven't got the position yet.

37:04.456 --> 37:06.561
You will, Darcy.

37:06.591 --> 37:09.970
And I won't do anything
to jeopardize your chances.

37:10.028 --> 37:11.974
We are gonna accomplish so much, Julia.

37:13.398 --> 37:14.604
Wish me luck.

37:14.633 --> 37:16.135
Of course.

37:16.201 --> 37:18.704
I'll be here when you get back.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.259
So you had no idea

37:41.293 --> 37:43.637
that Lucille had been living a double life?

37:43.662 --> 37:44.800
No.

37:44.829 --> 37:48.333
Though, she did ask me recently
if I had ever been betrayed.

37:48.400 --> 37:49.936
Betrayed?

37:49.968 --> 37:52.574
As if she was asking my advice.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.982
So something had been troubling her?

37:58.176 --> 38:01.521
Lucille's note to Mr. Carling...

38:01.580 --> 38:04.686
"All will be revealed."

38:04.749 --> 38:07.093
William, this isn't her handwriting.

38:09.854 --> 38:12.767
Both notes were written in the same hand.

38:12.791 --> 38:17.501
Perhaps someone was
directing Lucille to the book.

38:17.529 --> 38:19.509
Do you think it could
have been Mr. Carling?

38:19.531 --> 38:21.374
Well, it's possible.

38:21.433 --> 38:24.039
But I believe Mr. Carling
was genuinely surprised

38:24.102 --> 38:27.811
when Lucille approached
him in The Devil's Drum.

38:27.839 --> 38:29.876
I believe Lucille's actions

38:29.941 --> 38:32.444
we're being directed by a third party.

38:32.477 --> 38:35.686
What, like some sort of Svengali?

38:35.714 --> 38:38.160
She didn't do this of her own accord.

38:38.183 --> 38:39.821
Well, perhaps she did.

38:39.851 --> 38:41.797
What do you mean?

38:41.820 --> 38:43.299
Well, think about it this way.

38:43.321 --> 38:47.167
What if she wasn't a victim
or a pawn in all this?

38:47.192 --> 38:50.196
What if beneath that quiet exterior

38:50.228 --> 38:52.139
Lucille was a willing participant

38:52.163 --> 38:54.575
who enjoyed breaking taboos?

38:54.633 --> 38:58.046
Like undressing for strangers?

38:58.069 --> 39:00.913
If the man she loved told her to do it.

39:00.972 --> 39:02.474
Her fiancé?

39:02.507 --> 39:04.817
Well, he didn't even know about her tattoo.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.845
I doubt they shared intimate secrets.

39:06.878 --> 39:09.415
Well, they were to be married.

39:09.481 --> 39:11.927
Women marry for many reasons, William,

39:12.017 --> 39:14.395
not always for passion.

39:14.419 --> 39:18.162
Women are taught to hide their passion.

39:18.189 --> 39:19.725
And not only women;

39:19.758 --> 39:21.101
Men too.

39:21.760 --> 39:24.400
Don't you feel that sometimes, William?

39:38.243 --> 39:39.881
Cats must be lying with dogs.

39:39.911 --> 39:41.390
I beg your pardon.

39:41.413 --> 39:43.086
You're ten minutes late.

39:44.115 --> 39:46.356
George?

39:46.384 --> 39:48.022
We're on a reconnaissance mission, sir.

39:48.053 --> 39:50.624
We're off to observe the lads at Station 5.

39:50.689 --> 39:52.396
Their nine are practicing this morning,

39:52.424 --> 39:54.461
and rumor has it, they brought in a ringer.

39:54.526 --> 39:55.800
Oh.

39:55.860 --> 39:56.861
Uh, George,

39:56.895 --> 39:58.932
do you know how to operate
that piece of equipment?

39:58.963 --> 40:00.636
Well, I'm thinking of employing

40:00.699 --> 40:02.906
a trial-and-error method, sir.

40:02.934 --> 40:03.935
Ah.

40:03.968 --> 40:04.969
Good luck, gentlemen.

40:05.036 --> 40:06.606
And be careful.

40:09.107 --> 40:11.644
Okay, Station 5, let's look alive!

40:11.710 --> 40:12.711
Get out there.

40:12.744 --> 40:14.314
Show some jolly hustle. Come on.

40:14.379 --> 40:15.756
Come on, lads.

40:20.318 --> 40:21.922
Nothing to worry about, Crabtree.

40:21.953 --> 40:24.627
Your form's better than this.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.397
Never seen that bloke before.

40:33.131 --> 40:34.769
Whoa! Whoa!

40:34.799 --> 40:36.278
- Whoo-hoo!
- All right, all right.

40:36.301 --> 40:39.908
Bloody hell. The rumors are true.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.975
He's not a copper.

40:42.006 --> 40:45.317
This is utterly against
the spirit of the game.

40:45.343 --> 40:47.914
Sir, didn't you bring in a ringer?

40:47.946 --> 40:50.859
I was merely leveling up the playing field.

40:50.915 --> 40:52.690
I should be forming a protest.

40:52.751 --> 40:54.788
To whom, sir?

40:57.122 --> 40:59.932
Well, then, I'll find some
other way to take him out.

41:03.261 --> 41:05.605
A librarian soliciting strange men

41:05.630 --> 41:07.166
down at The Devil's Drum.

41:07.198 --> 41:08.677
Press will have a field day.

41:08.700 --> 41:10.611
What have you got?

41:10.635 --> 41:12.275
Well, sir, we know the murder took place

41:12.303 --> 41:14.476
after the library was closed.

41:14.506 --> 41:17.009
Her body was found in the
woods in Rosedale Valley,

41:17.041 --> 41:18.349
not far from the path.

41:18.376 --> 41:20.014
Did she know the suspects?

41:20.044 --> 41:22.354
Yes, sir, all but Mr. Faber,

41:22.380 --> 41:23.791
an ornithologist who spent

41:23.815 --> 41:25.317
a great deal of time at the library

41:25.350 --> 41:27.523
but claims he never
spoke with Miss Messing.

41:27.552 --> 41:30.465
He was the last person to see her alive.

41:30.488 --> 41:31.694
Isn't ornithology a hobby

41:31.723 --> 41:34.499
better pursued in nature than in a library?

41:34.526 --> 41:36.199
Mr. Faber may have been more infatuated

41:36.227 --> 41:38.639
with the librarian than the books.

41:38.663 --> 41:39.971
- Alibi?
- No, sir.

41:39.998 --> 41:41.739
He was at home alone.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.404
And gentleman number two?

41:43.468 --> 41:46.210
A Geoffrey Coville, the victim's fiancée©.

41:46.237 --> 41:49.707
He was more upset to learn
of her unconventional behavior

41:49.741 --> 41:52.847
and went so far as to say that
if she was behaving this way,

41:52.877 --> 41:55.050
she got what she deserved.

41:55.079 --> 41:56.752
Oh, well, that was nice of him.

41:56.815 --> 41:59.489
Oh, sir, maybe Mr. Coville
discovered the truth

41:59.517 --> 42:02.828
that his betrothed was
not the lily-white innocent

42:02.854 --> 42:03.855
he believed her to be

42:03.888 --> 42:06.994
and killed her in some sort of blind rage.

42:07.025 --> 42:08.231
He claims to have been alone

42:08.259 --> 42:09.863
in a hotel in Cobourg at the time.

42:09.894 --> 42:12.204
But as of yet, I've been
unable to confirm it.

42:12.230 --> 42:14.210
Let me know as soon as you find out.

42:14.232 --> 42:15.734
And the third gentleman?

42:15.767 --> 42:17.440
Uh, Leonard Carling,

42:17.502 --> 42:20.346
a married man who had a
liaison with Miss Messing.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.214
But he lied about the encounter

42:22.240 --> 42:25.414
and also lied about following
her into the library.

42:25.443 --> 42:27.753
Miss Messing teased Mr. Carling, sir,

42:27.779 --> 42:29.417
with the promise of a risqué encounter.

42:29.447 --> 42:30.790
However, upon their next meeting,

42:30.849 --> 42:32.453
she denied she knew him.

42:32.517 --> 42:35.862
Maybe, sir, Carling decided
to pursue his passions there,

42:35.887 --> 42:37.958
and, being thwarted a third time,

42:38.022 --> 42:39.092
took his revenge.

42:40.225 --> 42:41.636
That's possible.

42:41.693 --> 42:44.013
On the night of the murder,
Mr. Carling claims to have been

42:44.028 --> 42:45.735
in the company of another young woman,

42:45.763 --> 42:47.800
whose name he doesn't seem to remember.

42:47.866 --> 42:49.243
Let's bring him in.

42:49.267 --> 42:51.042
Suggest a conversation with his wife

42:51.069 --> 42:52.946
might to aid in jogging his memory.

42:52.971 --> 42:53.972
Yes, sir.

42:54.038 --> 42:55.813
We need to figure this out, gentlemen,

42:55.874 --> 42:59.651
before every woman in Toronto
is afraid to walk the streets.

43:09.587 --> 43:10.998
Excuse me.

43:11.055 --> 43:12.090
Yes?

43:12.123 --> 43:15.570
I requested an Audubon monograph

43:15.593 --> 43:16.594
two weeks ago.

43:16.628 --> 43:19.905
Has it... has it... has it arrived?

43:19.931 --> 43:22.434
Oh, well, uh, I'll check.

43:24.135 --> 43:25.512
Oh, please do.

43:25.570 --> 43:27.948
I have been most patient.

43:33.244 --> 43:36.020
But you agreed we would
start to promote a clinic.

43:36.080 --> 43:37.855
I've changed my mind.

43:37.916 --> 43:40.294
Is this because of the arrest?

43:40.318 --> 43:41.854
It's too risky...

43:41.920 --> 43:44.924
for you and for the
other people helping us,

43:44.956 --> 43:45.957
for our patients.

43:45.990 --> 43:47.867
It's a risk we're willing to take.

43:49.861 --> 43:53.206
Our cause may be an idea ahead of its time.

43:53.264 --> 43:55.710
At any rate, I can no longer take part.

43:55.767 --> 43:58.873
But without you, there is no clinic.

44:00.772 --> 44:03.275
I've weighed this decision
very carefully, Emily.

44:03.308 --> 44:05.049
I'm sorry.

44:05.109 --> 44:06.782
I've made up my mind.

44:17.822 --> 44:19.699
Time, gentlemen, please.

44:37.175 --> 44:38.848
Hello, Miss Fulford.

44:40.244 --> 44:43.691
I'm sorry. You must be mistaken.

44:43.715 --> 44:45.592
As you wish.

44:45.650 --> 44:48.062
Who are you?

44:48.086 --> 44:50.032
Now, why would I tell you that?

45:00.498 --> 45:02.739
Police Station 4, please.

45:02.767 --> 45:05.407
I'm afraid Detective Murdoch isn't here.

45:05.436 --> 45:08.110
Well, I'll have to locate
him. Can he telephone you back?

45:08.172 --> 45:09.344
Well, can you tell him

45:09.374 --> 45:11.615
to get to the library as soon as he can?

45:11.676 --> 45:13.781
I think The Black Hand have found me.

45:13.845 --> 45:15.290
Thank you.

45:17.782 --> 45:19.455
How long ago was this, Constable?

45:19.517 --> 45:22.589
Moments ago, sir. I
didn't know where you were.

45:31.629 --> 45:32.937
Hello?

45:40.438 --> 45:41.542
Who are you?

46:40.998 --> 46:42.534
Please...

46:42.600 --> 46:43.601
Please, no.
