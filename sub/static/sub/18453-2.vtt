00:22.523 --> 00:24.441
Okay, my little herpetologists.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.026
Let's review.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.195
Warm or cold-blooded?

00:28.278 --> 00:29.363
Cold!

00:29.446 --> 00:31.657
- Covered in...
- Scales.

00:31.740 --> 00:34.201
Found on every continent except...

00:34.284 --> 00:36.036
Antarctica!

00:36.119 --> 00:37.996
You are brilliant!

00:38.080 --> 00:39.289
And your snakes are tired,

00:39.372 --> 00:41.834
so please return them to their homes
and we'll return to our textbooks.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.756
I hear your heart beating.

00:47.840 --> 00:52.094
Don't be afraid.
I know you are a good snake.

00:55.222 --> 00:58.433
<i>The attack on the school bus</i>
<i>took my friends' lives...</i>

00:59.059 --> 01:00.477
<i>took my sight...</i>

01:01.562 --> 01:03.188
<i>but I survived.</i>

01:04.606 --> 01:07.150
<i>My father wanted to keep that a secret.</i>

01:07.234 --> 01:11.530
<i>He smuggled me out of Russia to America,</i>
<i>to a boarding school for the blind.</i>

01:12.615 --> 01:14.407
<i>He felt I'd be safe there.</i>

01:15.033 --> 01:19.162
<i>My maternal aunt would check in on me</i>
<i>and he would join me as soon as he could.</i>

01:20.330 --> 01:24.459
<i>Until then, I had every Sunday night</i>
<i>to look forward to.</i>

01:47.107 --> 01:48.942
Did you like it?

01:49.026 --> 01:52.112
<i>I could find you</i>
<i>in the midst of a million violins</i>

01:52.195 --> 01:53.864
<i>if you played just one note.</i>

01:53.947 --> 01:56.617
<i>Maybe three notes. But no more.</i>

01:56.700 --> 01:58.952
<i>How was the food this week?</i>

01:59.036 --> 02:00.537
<i>Don't wrinkle your nose!</i>

02:06.334 --> 02:08.921
I'll have Auntie bring you some vatrushka.

02:09.004 --> 02:12.466
<i>I told my friend I would be with you soon.</i>

02:12.549 --> 02:15.218
Soon. I promise.

02:17.930 --> 02:19.556
I need to be careful...

02:20.598 --> 02:23.852
<i>find a new home, where we'll be safe.</i>

02:23.936 --> 02:26.689
<i>It's like hide-and-seek.</i>
<i>Right now we are hiding.</i>

02:26.772 --> 02:29.024
<i>Can you stay hidden a little longer?</i>

02:29.107 --> 02:31.694
Because of you, I know I can do anything.

02:31.777 --> 02:33.737
<i>You can do anything.</i>

02:34.529 --> 02:35.697
Nina...

02:37.282 --> 02:38.909
listen carefully.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.247
No one can know who you are.

02:44.915 --> 02:49.336
You need to stop speaking Russian
until we see each other again.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.504
<i>Understand?</i>

02:51.588 --> 02:52.630
Yes.

02:54.091 --> 02:56.051
I have one last request.

02:57.427 --> 03:00.263
Play.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.071
<i>He was my lifeline.</i>

03:16.154 --> 03:17.614
And I was his.

03:18.741 --> 03:20.743
Every Sunday, we saved each other.

03:22.244 --> 03:25.998
We shed our skins and plotted the future.

03:27.165 --> 03:30.293
I had escaped the Voi, and he would, too.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.546
We'd fool everyone together.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.802
<i>But then, one day, I was called down</i>
<i>to the headmistress' office.</i>

03:46.935 --> 03:49.646
Nina, your aunt...

03:49.730 --> 03:52.274
she's here because something
has happened to your father.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.234
I'm so sorry.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.529
Ninachka.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.531
Auntie.

04:06.538 --> 04:08.123
There was an accident...

04:09.041 --> 04:10.542
a horrible accident.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.419
Your papa is gone.

04:13.461 --> 04:14.629
He isn't dead.

04:14.713 --> 04:17.257
- He's in hiding from the Voi.
- Ninachka--

04:17.340 --> 04:19.176
Your aunt is here
to take you to live with her.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.846
I can't speak Russian.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.514
I can't go with her!

04:24.598 --> 04:27.517
I'm sorry, Nina.
You have to go home.

04:27.600 --> 04:31.104
But I don't have a home
until he comes and we make one!

04:31.188 --> 04:34.274
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
I know it's been good for you here.

04:38.445 --> 04:42.699
<i>I felt my father was in hiding,</i>
<i>but my aunt believed he had died,</i>

04:42.783 --> 04:45.035
<i>and both of our lives</i>
<i>had changed for the worse.</i>

04:46.286 --> 04:49.289
<i>See, as long as I was in school</i>
<i>and she was watching out for me,</i>

04:49.372 --> 04:50.623
<i>my father made sure money,</i>

04:50.707 --> 04:53.043
<i>more money than she had ever seen</i>
<i>in her entire life,</i>

04:53.126 --> 04:54.795
<i>flowed into her account.</i>

04:54.878 --> 04:57.339
<i>For my tuition, for her attention.</i>

04:57.422 --> 04:59.049
<i>But that was all done now.</i>

04:59.674 --> 05:01.301
<i>What little money was left in the account</i>

05:01.384 --> 05:04.346
<i>wasn't enough to cover the burden</i>
<i>of raising a blind child.</i>

05:04.429 --> 05:06.974
Her name is Nina.
She's my niece.

05:07.891 --> 05:09.684
She is fucking blind?

05:09.768 --> 05:15.065
Be decent. Her father, my brother in-law,
a great man, just died.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.865
<i>I was really lonely then.</i>

05:25.408 --> 05:28.370
<i>For the first time,</i>
<i>my blindness felt like a prison.</i>

05:31.164 --> 05:33.000
<i>- It was cold where I slept.</i>

05:34.251 --> 05:36.419
<i>I rarely spoke to anyone...</i>

05:37.420 --> 05:41.133
<i>except for the babies,</i>
<i>who would come and go.</i>

05:41.216 --> 05:43.426
Believe me,
that picture doesn't do him justice.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.095
Beautiful.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.014
How can his mother not want him?

05:47.097 --> 05:48.848
She's young, a college student.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.518
No, he was meant for you.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.103
We're so lucky.

05:53.186 --> 05:56.106
We never thought, at this point, a baby.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.315
Mmm.

05:57.399 --> 05:58.566
We have his room all ready.

05:58.650 --> 06:01.028
Yeah, of course.
Have you brought the money?

06:01.736 --> 06:03.613
Yes, Abel brought it.

06:03.697 --> 06:07.659
Um, we've... been in the car all day.

06:07.742 --> 06:10.662
-May I use your restroom?
-Oh, yeah, of course. It's upstairs.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.877
The first door, you can't miss it.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.071
What's your name, sweetheart?

07:26.154 --> 07:28.365
Shh.

07:29.199 --> 07:32.118
You can talk to me.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.088
I'm Nancy.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.016
I'm Nina.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.602
Does your mom live here?

07:57.685 --> 07:59.479
No, she's dead.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.203
What the hell is this?

08:16.329 --> 08:18.999
Do you know why I'm here?
I'm a cancer survivor.

08:20.792 --> 08:21.876
Nina?

08:22.585 --> 08:23.836
It's okay, I said she could.

08:23.920 --> 08:27.382
Enough, Nina. Go ask Tamara
to help you with your homework.

08:27.465 --> 08:28.841
She said you are behind.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.385
Couldn't we take them both?

08:30.468 --> 08:32.387
Nance, this... I...

08:32.470 --> 08:34.431
Abel, this child is special.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.642
She... she needs more than this.

08:38.435 --> 08:41.771
I can imagine it's very hard.

08:41.854 --> 08:43.065
It is.

08:43.148 --> 08:45.108
Both her parents have passed.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.276
We'll pay you.

08:50.072 --> 08:52.074
Better for you to take the baby.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.650
We choose her.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.117
If you want her, I can't stop you.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.536
You can provide for her
better than I could.

09:39.162 --> 09:40.872
Only, no one should know.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.624
No one would know anyway.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.085
We'll change her name.
Blank slate.

09:45.168 --> 09:49.214
We'll... we'll make her an American girl.

09:50.548 --> 09:53.593
Do you... do you wanna come live with us?

09:53.676 --> 09:54.802
Yes, I'd like that.

09:54.886 --> 09:57.847
Oh, your eyes are blue as the prairie sky.

09:58.932 --> 10:02.519
Prairie. That's what I'll call you.

10:08.566 --> 10:11.068
Here we go, Prairie!

10:11.153 --> 10:14.030
- Careful, Abel!
- Oh, she isn't going to break.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.407
- Careful!
- Are you, Prairie?

10:15.490 --> 10:17.284
-No.
-No? I can't hear you.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.826
-No.
-I can't hear you.

10:18.910 --> 10:21.204
-No!
-I can't hear you!

10:21.288 --> 10:22.289
No!

10:23.790 --> 10:25.625
Okay!

10:27.585 --> 10:30.046
This is your new home.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.840
Well, Prairie, we take off our shoes here.

10:33.841 --> 10:35.218
Let me help you.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.054
Okay, can I lift this foot?

10:38.888 --> 10:40.557
And lift that foot.

10:46.188 --> 10:48.481
Wow! How is that?

10:48.565 --> 10:49.607
Good.

10:49.691 --> 10:52.360
Feel all the branches on it,
and the leaves.

10:54.154 --> 10:57.448
You're climbing a tree!

10:57.532 --> 11:01.661
"'You don't know what these beans are,'
said the man to Jack.

11:01.744 --> 11:05.832
'If you plant them overnight,
by morning they'll...

11:07.334 --> 11:09.211
Up, up, to the sky.

11:09.294 --> 11:13.548
And if it does not turn out to be true,
you can have your cow back.'"

11:13.631 --> 11:16.008
Okay, we'll go to the next one.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.239
She's sleeping.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.991
She's been doing this
for a couple of weeks.

11:42.577 --> 11:45.872
I'm taping it so we can show a doctor.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.791
She needs a doctor, Nancy.

11:56.674 --> 11:59.761
Honey! Prairie, let go. Prairie. Nina!

11:59.844 --> 12:01.178
Oh!

12:03.681 --> 12:05.558
Prairie believes her father's alive

12:05.642 --> 12:08.811
and sneaking her messages
about where to find him in dreams.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.564
She also believes her dreams
are premonitions,

12:11.648 --> 12:13.941
and that the Russian Mafia are after her.

12:14.025 --> 12:18.154
Kids tell tall tales. I did myself.

12:18.237 --> 12:23.493
Yes, but hers are tales of grandeur
that she believes are reality.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.994
Myths that make her special.

12:25.077 --> 12:27.079
So what are you saying exactly?

12:27.163 --> 12:30.082
Prairie's exhibiting early signs
of serious mental illness.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.794
You don't happen to know
the mental history

12:32.877 --> 12:34.504
of her biological parents, do you?

12:34.587 --> 12:36.464
No. Um...

12:36.548 --> 12:41.303
But I am sure that
when she's been with us for a while,

12:41.386 --> 12:42.429
she's gonna be--

12:42.512 --> 12:44.013
Her new stability is essential, yes,

12:44.097 --> 12:48.393
but the best way to support her, ma'am,
is with the right mix of medication.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.896
But how...
how will medication make her better?

12:51.980 --> 12:54.190
I can't medicate her. She's a child!

12:54.274 --> 12:57.443
- What she needs is love.
- Okay, let me be clear.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.320
Untreated, she gets worse.

13:00.071 --> 13:04.575
Blind children are
extraordinarily imaginative,

13:04.659 --> 13:06.578
but this is different, okay?

13:06.661 --> 13:08.496
We're dealing with a psychosis.

13:10.039 --> 13:13.001
If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna
get some samples. I'll be right back.

13:29.934 --> 13:35.732
Because we've got friends and relatives
far away from here who wanna see you.

13:35.815 --> 13:40.403
And also, I think a good mom should have
a picture of her little girl.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.071
-You ready?
-Yes.

13:42.154 --> 13:45.367
One, two, three.

13:45.450 --> 13:46.784
There we go.

13:46.868 --> 13:49.370
<i>Nina!</i>

14:03.217 --> 14:04.301
Prairie, honey...

14:05.302 --> 14:07.054
have one of these.

14:07.138 --> 14:11.100
It'll make you feel better.
Okay, there you go.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.895
And here's some water.

14:18.441 --> 14:21.235
Good girl. You feeling better?

14:21.319 --> 14:22.320
Mmm.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.739
<i>Okay, how does that feel to you?</i>

14:24.822 --> 14:26.574
Good. Fine, fine.

14:26.657 --> 14:29.744
- Is his collar okay?
- Yeah. It's very nice.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.579
I'm starting to sweat.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.623
The lights are hot, sorry about that.

14:33.706 --> 14:34.957
All right, this is gonna be sweet,

14:35.041 --> 14:37.001
not many grandparents come in
with their grandkids.

14:37.085 --> 14:38.669
She's our daughter.

14:38.753 --> 14:40.922
Open mouth, insert foot. Sorry.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.341
All right, everybody, relax. Looking good.

14:43.424 --> 14:47.178
Prairie, my dear,
toward the sound my voice. Prairie?

14:47.261 --> 14:49.680
Prairie,
toward the sound of my voice, honey.

14:49.764 --> 14:50.807
Yeah, there you go.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.476
<i>I was medicated for 13 years.</i>

14:54.977 --> 14:56.813
<i>It made me feel numb inside.</i>

14:57.730 --> 15:00.650
<i>- But it didn't stop my premonitions.</i>

15:02.110 --> 15:03.528
Nina!

15:04.487 --> 15:06.114
Nina!

15:07.824 --> 15:09.659
Nina!

15:45.570 --> 15:46.487
Papa.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.550
You up, sweetheart?

16:07.633 --> 16:09.552
Yeah, I'm good. I'm up!

16:13.723 --> 16:15.433
Let me see in the light.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.435
Oh.

16:20.605 --> 16:24.942
This time of year is...
is always hard on you.

16:26.611 --> 16:27.653
Hold on.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.544
Let's not tell your father.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.005
<i>The medicine dulled me.</i>

16:46.088 --> 16:48.132
But it didn't stop the dreams.

16:48.925 --> 16:51.553
They just kept coming, for years.

16:51.636 --> 16:54.138
Because they were messages
from my father,

16:54.222 --> 16:55.848
reminding me that he was alive,

16:55.932 --> 16:59.310
that he was waiting for me,
that he was calling for me.

16:59.393 --> 17:02.229
Maybe you dreamed of him
because you missed him.

17:03.230 --> 17:06.317
Hmm, normal dreams
don't make your nose bleed.

17:08.570 --> 17:12.239
The premonitions were powerful
because I could see in them.

17:13.575 --> 17:16.285
Twenty-one wax candles, my birthday.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.079
That's when we were to meet.

17:19.080 --> 17:22.792
The face of a giantess,
surrounded by water.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.129
There's only one place that could be.

17:27.838 --> 17:29.382
I made a plan to go there.

17:30.466 --> 17:31.926
Wait a minute. So you just left?

17:32.718 --> 17:35.930
Come on, she didn't just run away.
Right?

17:37.848 --> 17:38.683
I did.

17:40.935 --> 17:42.895
I knew my father was waiting for me,

17:42.979 --> 17:45.648
that Nancy and Abel
would never understand.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.486
A girl I knew from school
was going to Chicago.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.364
I got her to give me a ride
to the Greyhound station.

17:54.365 --> 17:55.866
And from there...

17:57.702 --> 17:58.995
I disappeared.

19:25.122 --> 19:26.916
Miss, we're closed.

19:28.459 --> 19:30.627
I have to ask you to get on the ferry.

19:30.711 --> 19:32.588
I can't, I'm waiting for someone.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.215
Maybe you've seen him?

19:34.298 --> 19:38.511
He's tall, blonde.
His hair might be gray now, or grayish.

19:39.762 --> 19:41.222
No, sorry.

19:41.889 --> 19:42.932
But, miss...

19:45.309 --> 19:47.019
you have to get on the ferry.

19:56.237 --> 19:57.738
I turned 21 today.

19:58.656 --> 19:59.949
Happy birthday.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.912
I wondered all day what it said about her.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.999
Would you read it to me?

20:08.708 --> 20:11.335
Yeah. But then you have to
get on the ferry.

20:12.586 --> 20:13.713
You gotta go.

20:17.633 --> 20:21.303
"Here, at our sea-washed, sunset gates

20:21.387 --> 20:24.681
shall stand a mighty woman with a torch,

20:24.766 --> 20:27.810
whose flame is the imprisoned lightning,

20:27.894 --> 20:31.147
and her name, Mother of Exiles.

20:32.732 --> 20:36.819
<i>From her beacon-hand</i>
<i>glows world-wide welcome,</i>

20:36.903 --> 20:43.117
<i>her mild eyes command the air-bridged</i>
<i>harbor that twin cities frame.</i>

20:44.576 --> 20:50.207
<i>'Keep ancient lands, your storied pomp!'</i>
<i>cries she with silent lips.</i>

20:51.250 --> 20:53.669
<i>'Give me your tired, your poor,</i>

20:53.753 --> 20:56.588
<i>your huddled masses</i>
<i>yearning to breathe free,</i>

20:56.672 --> 20:59.925
<i>the wretched refuse of your teeming shore.</i>

21:02.219 --> 21:06.057
<i>Send these, the homeless,</i>
<i>tempest-tost to me.</i>

21:06.140 --> 21:09.602
<i>I lift my lamp beside the golden door!'"</i>

21:29.080 --> 21:30.957
<i>I should have gone home...</i>

21:31.958 --> 21:35.336
<i>but I was heartbroken and ashamed.</i>

21:35.419 --> 21:37.046
<i>Too proud.</i>

21:41.425 --> 21:45.096
<i>I didn't wanna give up,</i>
<i>so I devised one last plan.</i>

21:47.514 --> 21:51.268
<i>If I couldn't see my father,</i>
<i>maybe he could hear me.</i>

21:54.021 --> 21:57.149
I would play my violin in the underground
until he stepped off a train,

21:57.233 --> 21:58.943
heard my song, and came running.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.405
And do you know?

22:04.323 --> 22:05.324
My plan worked.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.995
But it wasn't my father who found me.

22:11.663 --> 22:13.207
It was another man.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.545
The man who would change my life.

22:35.312 --> 22:37.314
Oh, hey, later, French.
See you tomorrow.

22:38.274 --> 22:39.441
Right.

23:17.479 --> 23:19.315
We haven't done that in a while.

23:20.649 --> 23:21.609
Mmm.

23:22.359 --> 23:23.945
We can now.

23:26.948 --> 23:28.240
Your eyes...

23:29.491 --> 23:31.118
they're sparkling.

23:35.206 --> 23:37.166
You want breakfast in bed?

23:38.834 --> 23:41.378
Well, of course I want breakfast in bed.

24:02.649 --> 24:03.734
What?

24:05.152 --> 24:06.528
I went on a walk.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.324
Your mom and I could go with you.

24:12.826 --> 24:14.536
Alone. Sometimes, I...

24:14.620 --> 24:16.580
Sometimes I just need to be alone.

24:18.457 --> 24:22.003
The last time you went out on your own,
you came back with dog bites.

24:24.713 --> 24:27.299
And then this thing with
Steve Winchell's teacher,

24:27.383 --> 24:29.551
and now you're hiding things from us.

24:29.635 --> 24:32.179
Look, I know that you're trying
to keep me safe.

24:32.888 --> 24:37.142
And I know that I let you down.
I... embarrassed you.

24:37.893 --> 24:40.354
I'm sorry, but I can't...

24:40.437 --> 24:43.399
I can't live cooped up
in this house all the time.

24:44.983 --> 24:48.945
Maybe the doctor in St. Louis was right,
and we... we took you home too soon.

24:49.030 --> 24:51.573
Maybe you need time in medical care.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.200
-Please don't say that.
-Professionals--

24:53.283 --> 24:54.284
Please, I'm...

24:57.913 --> 24:59.915
I'm sorry that I scared you.

25:02.251 --> 25:03.711
Please don't send me away.

25:06.046 --> 25:08.549
If you talk to that trauma counselor,

25:08.632 --> 25:11.635
the one from the FBI,
the one that keeps calling.

25:11.718 --> 25:14.763
You need someone with experience.

25:16.682 --> 25:19.017
- If I do, can I walk at night?
- Prairie--

25:19.101 --> 25:22.063
On my own.
Just for clearing my head, not to--

25:22.146 --> 25:24.606
It's not safe, Prairie.

25:24.690 --> 25:25.733
One hour.

25:26.608 --> 25:29.611
She can have an hour walk. Right?

25:31.029 --> 25:34.075
Maybe she needs some
wide open space, Nance.

25:45.085 --> 25:45.919
<i>Adrian.</i>

25:50.132 --> 25:51.341
Here you go, bud.

25:52.551 --> 25:53.760
Eat. Let's go.

25:58.348 --> 26:00.184
Come on. Last bite, last bite.

26:00.267 --> 26:01.852
You gotta go brush your teeth, all right?

26:02.603 --> 26:03.687
I did.

26:03.771 --> 26:05.647
No, you didn't. Your toothbrush was dry.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.568
All right.

26:12.654 --> 26:15.199
-You good?
-What?

26:15.282 --> 26:16.825
You good? Everything good?

26:17.826 --> 26:20.287
My butthole stinks, but yeah.

26:20.371 --> 26:22.998
Great. We'll have the doctor
check that out for you.

26:27.544 --> 26:29.755
All right.
Hey, come on. Last bite, last bite.

26:30.839 --> 26:34.218
Come on, there we go, there we go.
Gotta get to the bus stop, all right?

28:05.934 --> 28:07.311
Yo! What's up?

28:13.024 --> 28:15.527
- Mr. Harris?
<i>- Hi, Alfonso.</i>

28:15.611 --> 28:18.196
<i>This is Kevin Harris</i>
<i>from the Knightsman Foundation.</i>

28:19.114 --> 28:22.868
Uh, hi! It's, uh... it's nice to meet you.
Well, phone meet you.

28:22.951 --> 28:25.036
<i>We're very impressed by you, Alfonso.</i>

28:25.120 --> 28:27.581
<i>Athletics, grades, community involvement.</i>

28:27.664 --> 28:31.001
<i>And your essay about bees.</i>

28:31.084 --> 28:32.503
<i>Phenomenal.</i>

28:32.586 --> 28:33.629
Bees?

28:33.712 --> 28:37.132
<i>- Oh. Oh, my mistake.</i>

28:37.215 --> 28:40.010
<i>You wrote about learning CPR!</i>
<i>Sorry.</i>

28:40.093 --> 28:44.139
<i>Anyway, we loved it</i>
<i>and we want to offer you the scholarship.</i>

28:45.807 --> 28:47.893
<i>- How's that feel?</i>

28:47.976 --> 28:51.522
Wow, that's, uh... Wow.

28:51.605 --> 28:54.107
<i>That's what we like to hear.</i>

28:54.190 --> 28:57.027
<i>Your</i> abuela <i>will be over the moon.</i>

28:57.110 --> 28:59.613
He's actually gotta get back
to class, Mr. Harris.

28:59.696 --> 29:00.781
Uh, keep up those grades.

29:00.864 --> 29:02.032
We'll follow up soon.

29:02.115 --> 29:04.826
Uh, this means a lot to me. Thank you.

29:04.910 --> 29:08.830
<i>Welcome to the Knightsman family, Alfonso.</i>
<i>You have a great day.</i>

29:12.417 --> 29:13.335
You got it.

29:14.127 --> 29:16.297
What matters is you got it.

29:17.464 --> 29:19.424
It's okay. It's a lot to process.

29:20.634 --> 29:23.512
Uh, do I need to do anything?
Like, write 'em a letter, something?

29:23.595 --> 29:25.013
Just e-mail and accept.

29:25.096 --> 29:27.182
There's also a dinner, always awkward.

29:28.392 --> 29:31.937
And of course, carry a full course load,
uh, abide by the character clause.

29:32.020 --> 29:33.647
Oh. I don't know what that means.

29:33.730 --> 29:35.023
Ah, just don't do anything weird.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.859
Don't get in trouble with the cops
or anything. It'll be fine.

29:41.196 --> 29:44.408
Yo, you spell "Voi" with a "y" or an "i"?
I can't find anything.

29:44.491 --> 29:47.453
Maybe it's with Russian letters.
Open your mind.

29:53.709 --> 29:55.794
Hey. I, uh...

29:55.877 --> 29:58.464
I got your text.
That bus is messed up, right?

29:58.547 --> 30:00.006
Yeah. Fucked up.

30:02.258 --> 30:03.844
Uh, can I... Can I sit here?

30:05.304 --> 30:08.515
-Can you help us look shit up?
-Uh, yeah, yeah, sure.

30:09.391 --> 30:10.809
You gotta help us find some shit.

30:10.892 --> 30:13.645
Yeah, we haven't found anything
on Nina Azarov yet.

30:13.729 --> 30:15.605
Well, she was a kid.
Maybe her dad scrubbed it

30:15.689 --> 30:17.566
- so she couldn't be traced.
- Mmm.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.568
Uh, I'll look up "Azarov mine."

30:19.651 --> 30:21.945
I mean, she said her father
had a mine, right?

30:22.029 --> 30:24.197
- Yeah. Yeah, good idea.
- Mmm-hmm.

30:28.118 --> 30:29.745
She trying to get you out of Asheville?

30:29.828 --> 30:31.121
Fat chance.

30:31.204 --> 30:33.707
But just 'cause they haven't come yet,
doesn't mean they won't.

30:33.790 --> 30:35.417
Plan on talking to your parents?

30:35.501 --> 30:36.543
What's Asheville?

30:37.503 --> 30:40.714
Uh, it's like boot camp,
or military school.

30:40.797 --> 30:43.800
-You know, for bad kids.
-Are you even trying to find anything?

30:43.884 --> 30:45.469
Try some Russian shit.

30:50.432 --> 30:53.101
Hey, you sent me that Snapchat?

30:53.184 --> 30:55.812
-Oh, yeah.
-No, I don't want to look at that.

30:56.396 --> 30:58.065
I know. We're tracing her story.

30:58.148 --> 31:00.192
Like, nothing so far,
uh, except for the bus.

31:00.275 --> 31:02.068
- Which is huge.
- Yeah.

31:08.534 --> 31:10.326
You'll be there tonight, right?

31:13.497 --> 31:15.791
That guy thinks he's the shit, doesn't he?

31:16.541 --> 31:18.585
He's a fucking dick
if he doesn't come back.

31:26.051 --> 31:27.928
Come sit, baby.

31:28.011 --> 31:29.680
<i>Maman</i> has a headache.

31:35.519 --> 31:37.438
Is something wrong?

31:37.521 --> 31:40.732
No, no, actually,
uh, I have good news.

31:40.816 --> 31:43.777
- Ah?
- Really good news.

31:44.945 --> 31:48.449
-I got the call today, from that trust.
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh?

31:48.532 --> 31:50.492
And I got the scholarship.

31:51.743 --> 31:54.788
I can go to any school in Michigan,
for free.

31:54.871 --> 31:57.123
So you don't have to worry about anything.

31:59.418 --> 32:02.337
Nothing, <i>Maman.</i> Not even a cent.

32:04.465 --> 32:06.382
So you're done with Harvard?

32:08.802 --> 32:11.304
Uh, well, I...
I haven't heard back from them.

32:11.387 --> 32:14.766
But this is an option, a really good one.

32:14.850 --> 32:16.977
I just want the best for you, baby.

32:20.271 --> 32:22.107
We'll make it without you...

32:23.108 --> 32:25.277
By the skin of our teeth, we will.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.404
Well, I can drive down some weekends,

32:27.488 --> 32:29.615
and we can go to Carlos'
baseball games together.

32:29.698 --> 32:32.451
Baby, you know I can't go
to those things in my condition.

32:32.534 --> 32:33.952
If you really feel like
you have a condition,

32:34.035 --> 32:35.996
you should let me take you to the doctor.

32:37.622 --> 32:38.540
See?

32:40.250 --> 32:43.253
What am I going to do without you
worrying about me all the time, huh?

32:45.547 --> 32:48.800
Well, that's what I'm saying.
You know, I'll be close.

32:49.801 --> 32:50.802
Michigan.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.351
I'm proud of you.

32:59.603 --> 33:03.356
And you deserve
everything in the world...

33:04.399 --> 33:05.817
and more.

33:07.903 --> 33:09.279
<i>Merci, Maman.</i>

33:12.533 --> 33:14.117
A favor, my star?

33:15.118 --> 33:16.453
Pick up milk?

33:17.120 --> 33:19.706
I can't have my coffee
in the morning without it.

33:19.789 --> 33:22.375
Yeah. Sure.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.132
Hey, hey, French. Hey!

33:29.883 --> 33:31.635
Hey.

33:31.718 --> 33:33.469
Yeah, I thought I saw you there.

33:34.513 --> 33:37.182
So I... I like cold stuff in the cold.

33:37.265 --> 33:38.183
Cool.

33:39.560 --> 33:42.813
You're bringing milk?
That's... that's weird.

33:42.896 --> 33:44.731
Oh, no, uh, I'm not going.

33:49.110 --> 33:53.073
You're worried being at the house with her
will mess up getting into college, right?

33:53.156 --> 33:56.868
Yeah, well, I just got a scholarship,
actually. Full ride.

33:57.494 --> 33:58.495
Wow.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.997
If anyone would, it would be you.

34:02.624 --> 34:06.211
You know, my parents
kind of want me to be you. It's--

34:06.294 --> 34:08.255
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:08.338 --> 34:13.051
Uh, first they wanted me
to be Christine Yee, but...

34:17.013 --> 34:19.725
There's a character clause
for the scholarship?

34:19.808 --> 34:23.144
I mean, I know they have one
for the Mabel Allen.

34:23.228 --> 34:25.772
Wow, you know your shit.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.859
Yeah, it's like...

34:29.860 --> 34:32.988
they think people like us will just
slide into being criminals

34:33.071 --> 34:35.281
unless they specifically prohibit it.

34:35.365 --> 34:36.575
You gotta read up.

34:36.658 --> 34:40.662
Yeah. If I'm caught at a house
with drug deals, it's over, you know?

34:40.746 --> 34:42.706
-Mmm-hmm.
-It's different for someone like Steve.

34:42.789 --> 34:44.207
He's fucking his own life up.

34:44.291 --> 34:47.544
And I'm just trying not to fall into
the default of getting my life fucked.

34:47.628 --> 34:49.504
Well, if that makes sense.

34:49.588 --> 34:50.964
No, that makes sense.

34:52.007 --> 34:53.133
It's just...

34:53.216 --> 34:56.136
Aren't you curious
as to how it ends?

34:57.345 --> 34:59.347
-What, her story?
-Mmm.

34:59.430 --> 35:00.891
No, I... I don't really care.

35:00.974 --> 35:02.809
Her story, but...

35:03.894 --> 35:05.186
Us.

35:05.270 --> 35:10.108
I mean, don't you think that...
she picked us for some reason?

35:14.570 --> 35:19.242
Like, Steve's probably a murderer, and,
uh, Jesse's totally checked out of life,

35:19.326 --> 35:22.621
and Ms. Broderick-Allen is weird and sad,

35:22.704 --> 35:26.082
and I'm... well, you know.

35:27.542 --> 35:28.584
I don't need help.

35:29.169 --> 35:31.797
-No, I know, I wasn't--
-No, I do everything on my own.

35:33.924 --> 35:35.717
I know. I...

35:38.803 --> 35:42.515
Yeah. Well, I gotta get this back
in non-ice cube form. So...

35:43.058 --> 35:44.059
Okay.

36:03.620 --> 36:04.996
Damn it.

36:06.373 --> 36:07.666
Buck!

36:09.334 --> 36:10.501
Buck!

36:20.053 --> 36:21.387
Come on, let's go.

36:33.149 --> 36:34.901
Oh, that's cool.

36:35.652 --> 36:37.654
Got fucking frostbite last night.

36:43.118 --> 36:45.954
If we're gonna keep doing this,
you can't deal outta here.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.414
What's it to you?

36:49.040 --> 36:50.458
You just can't.

36:52.669 --> 36:55.213
Guys, OA said we only have an hour.

36:55.296 --> 36:58.049
-Let's not waste time.
-Whatever, man.

36:58.758 --> 37:01.136
But that means your supply
is cut, too, Buck.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.637
Including the testosterone.

37:18.945 --> 37:20.739
I can tell you everything
that I did wrong.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.575
I didn't eat when I was hungry.

37:23.658 --> 37:25.535
Didn't sleep when I was tired.

37:25.618 --> 37:27.370
Didn't get warm when I was cold.

37:27.453 --> 37:28.704
It made me weak.

37:30.706 --> 37:32.959
But the biggest mistake I made
was believing

37:33.043 --> 37:34.836
that if I cast a beautiful net...

37:36.087 --> 37:37.964
I'd catch only beautiful things.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.479
Your music, it's...

39:59.397 --> 40:01.316
Russian, yes?

40:04.069 --> 40:05.278
Are you Russian?

40:06.321 --> 40:08.531
Me? No. I'm American.

40:08.614 --> 40:09.615
Hap...

40:10.700 --> 40:13.536
...is my name.
Dr. Hunter Aloysius Percy,

40:13.619 --> 40:15.330
so, Hap for short.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.041
Can I... Can I help you with something?

40:18.124 --> 40:19.250
No, no, no.

40:21.502 --> 40:23.004
Can I ask you something?

40:23.671 --> 40:25.465
I'm sorry, I'm late. I have to go.

40:25.548 --> 40:27.425
Did you always play that well?

40:27.508 --> 40:29.219
Or did something happen to you?

40:30.761 --> 40:32.638
It did, didn't it?
Something happened to you and then you,

40:32.722 --> 40:36.142
then you could play...
transcendently like that.

40:37.268 --> 40:40.605
Did... I'm sorry.
Did... did you have an NDE?

40:40.688 --> 40:41.814
I don't know what that is.

40:41.898 --> 40:44.233
Uh, a near-death experience.
Did you die?

40:44.901 --> 40:46.444
Then come back to life?

41:03.003 --> 41:05.130
- You okay with lemon?
- Yeah.

41:05.213 --> 41:07.548
All right. Here we go.

41:07.632 --> 41:09.259
You take this, put it up to your mouth,

41:09.342 --> 41:11.677
and you just slurp the oyster down

41:11.761 --> 41:13.763
like you're sucking sea water
out of a shell.

41:16.557 --> 41:17.767
Oh.

41:21.729 --> 41:23.398
All right, I hated my first one, too.

41:23.481 --> 41:25.650
Uh, can we get some fries, please?

41:25.733 --> 41:27.276
But everything good in this world takes,

41:27.360 --> 41:28.653
uh, getting used to.

41:28.736 --> 41:31.822
Right, I remember my first coffee
in college.

41:31.906 --> 41:33.992
I wanted to throw up.
But by the end of medical school,

41:34.075 --> 41:36.077
I couldn't get out of bed
without a double shot.

41:36.161 --> 41:38.621
That's a lot of school for someone
who said they hated it.

41:38.705 --> 41:41.582
Well, I didn't... I just didn't understand

41:41.666 --> 41:44.960
why I wasn't supposed to ask the questions
that had no answers.

41:45.045 --> 41:47.213
They're the most interesting questions,
aren't they?

41:47.297 --> 41:48.673
What is consciousness?

41:48.756 --> 41:53.678
Where does consciousness go after...
you know, after this place?

41:53.761 --> 41:54.679
Hmm.

41:55.430 --> 41:56.889
But you know. Right?

41:56.972 --> 41:58.058
I mean, when you were...

41:58.141 --> 42:01.769
Let me ask you a question,
when you returned after dying, was that...

42:02.687 --> 42:05.023
Did you feel like that was a choice?

42:05.106 --> 42:07.192
-You experienced it as a choice?
-Yeah.

42:07.275 --> 42:08.859
Wow. Wow.

42:08.943 --> 42:11.529
You called it a near-death experience?

42:11.612 --> 42:12.697
-Yeah.
-So you had one?

42:12.780 --> 42:16.034
Uh, here, ketchup at midnight,

42:16.117 --> 42:18.494
mustard at four o'clock,
mayo at eight o'clock.

42:18.578 --> 42:20.955
Good stuff, okay?

42:21.872 --> 42:23.916
Did I have an NDE? No.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.252
I didn't, but I, uh...

42:28.213 --> 42:31.924
It's pretty much all I...
Well, it is all I think about.

42:32.007 --> 42:33.468
What my life's about.

42:34.385 --> 42:40.266
So I was an anesthesiologist in the ER,
and the first time I heard... uh...

42:40.349 --> 42:42.727
a patient flat-line, I thought...

42:43.436 --> 42:47.440
like, I almost heard... something.

42:47.523 --> 42:48.900
You know? Something...

42:49.609 --> 42:51.944
I don't know. Something.

42:54.363 --> 42:56.199
So I went to this bunch of doctors,
summoned my courage.

42:56.282 --> 42:57.283
I asked them, they're like,

42:57.367 --> 42:59.869
"Eh, yeah, everybody thinks
they feel something."

42:59.952 --> 43:02.997
No, I heard... a whoosh...

43:03.998 --> 43:07.627
of something leaving the body,

43:07.710 --> 43:11.422
and the whoosh... of it coming back.

43:15.468 --> 43:19.054
Now if they came back,
it means they went somewhere.

43:20.390 --> 43:21.641
Where did they go?

43:27.938 --> 43:29.274
We could prove that.

43:31.734 --> 43:32.860
Wow.

43:32.943 --> 43:37.157
I... I did what any reasonable scientist
would do.

43:37.240 --> 43:40.493
I walked away from the ER
and I started what has become

43:40.576 --> 43:45.790
a... a lifetime of study of,
uh, NDE survivors.

43:46.707 --> 43:49.001
So you know people like me.

43:51.629 --> 43:52.630
Yeah.

43:52.713 --> 43:56.759
Yeah, well, I'm... I'm doing a study
right now with three people just like you.

43:56.842 --> 43:59.137
Well, one of them is
particularly like you.

43:59.220 --> 44:02.723
She came back with, uh,
special skills, musical ability.

44:02.807 --> 44:04.099
Like, what is that?

44:04.184 --> 44:08.271
Perfect pitch, in her case,
but there are others I've met who've...

44:08.354 --> 44:09.897
People come back with, uh,

44:09.980 --> 44:14.444
mathematical or artistic, or, you know,
um... linguistic abilities.

44:14.527 --> 44:16.279
It's... It's...

44:16.362 --> 44:17.947
That's not what makes them amazing.

44:18.030 --> 44:20.074
What makes you incredible...

44:21.201 --> 44:25.163
is that you have traveled outside this...

44:26.289 --> 44:28.457
...coma...

44:29.667 --> 44:30.710
that we're all in.

44:31.877 --> 44:33.003
You know?

44:34.755 --> 44:36.090
Ever since I left Russia,

44:36.174 --> 44:39.260
the only thing I've thought about
every day is how to find my father.

44:40.052 --> 44:42.888
And he was the only person
who never made me feel like

44:42.972 --> 44:44.640
I was demented or--

44:44.724 --> 44:45.850
No, of course not.

44:45.933 --> 44:48.394
You should never have been medicated.

44:49.270 --> 44:50.188
Never.

44:50.813 --> 44:53.274
Why, because you're...
you have vivid dreams?

44:53.358 --> 44:54.900
That's insane.

44:58.070 --> 45:00.781
Sorry, this is so strange to hear that...

45:01.449 --> 45:03.826
I am weird, but that you like weird.

45:03.910 --> 45:05.203
No, weird is good.

45:06.912 --> 45:10.124
I mean, there's some pathetically
ordinary guy somewhere

45:10.208 --> 45:11.959
wearing a T-shirt with that
emblazoned on the front:

45:12.042 --> 45:13.753
"Weird is good."

45:23.137 --> 45:25.014
I have to go.

45:26.474 --> 45:27.892
Can I get the check, please?

45:28.518 --> 45:32.522
I have to fly home tonight,
get back to work.

45:32.605 --> 45:33.939
Um...

45:34.690 --> 45:37.610
I have something
I think you might like. Um...

45:37.693 --> 45:39.612
It's kind of an offshoot of my work.

45:39.695 --> 45:43.908
So, I was here, I sold a patent
at a conference yesterday, and...

45:43.991 --> 45:46.619
-Can I show you something?
-Yeah, yeah.

45:46.702 --> 45:48.120
Yeah? Okay.

45:50.623 --> 45:51.707
Here.

45:51.791 --> 45:53.918
Okay, let's get this stuff out of the way.

45:54.001 --> 45:59.549
So, like I said, a lot of it is about
trying to hear the whoosh, okay?

45:59.632 --> 46:04.345
I'm just gonna put that right in there.

46:04.429 --> 46:06.180
Okay, is that in?

46:13.354 --> 46:14.522
-Okay?
-Mmm-hmm.

46:14.605 --> 46:16.106
All right, now...

46:17.567 --> 46:19.193
You switch it on down there.

46:20.611 --> 46:24.532
This can make a heartbeat audible
at 500 feet.

46:25.616 --> 46:27.535
-Just press this?
-Uh-huh.

46:42.508 --> 46:45.011
That! She's move... Someone's moving.

46:45.094 --> 46:46.220
Yeah.

46:52.018 --> 46:53.936
Younger maybe? Like a kid?

46:54.019 --> 46:55.896
Absolutely, absolutely.

46:57.064 --> 47:01.110
You know, a heartbeat is...
is more unique even than a fingerprint.

47:01.193 --> 47:02.362
Here, try this.

47:16.459 --> 47:18.544
- Wow!
- Yeah.

47:34.560 --> 47:36.270
That's what you sound like.

47:38.564 --> 47:40.107
That's what I sound like.

47:48.491 --> 47:49.700
Take me with you.

47:51.243 --> 47:52.495
Study me.

47:54.163 --> 47:55.456
Are you sure?

48:03.548 --> 48:04.549
How long?

48:05.716 --> 48:07.968
No headwinds. Just a few hours.

48:11.764 --> 48:14.183
Put your hands to the right.
There's a window there.

48:14.266 --> 48:18.354
Pull it. Okay, slide it down and back.
There's a latch in the middle.

48:20.106 --> 48:23.067
Keep going, there you go,
and pull it up and over and back.

48:23.150 --> 48:26.612
Up and over and back, all the way.
Push the window.

48:28.072 --> 48:29.532
Push, go on.

48:52.722 --> 48:54.724
Okay, here we are.

48:57.309 --> 49:00.480
Glad I left the heat on. I don't know
what you would've thought of me

49:00.563 --> 49:02.523
if you walked into a freezing house.

49:05.901 --> 49:10.490
Oh, there's a bed downstairs in the lab,
hope that's okay.

49:16.411 --> 49:17.538
It's so quiet.

49:19.081 --> 49:21.000
There aren't any roads nearby?

49:21.083 --> 49:24.461
Uh, that and there's
insulated glazing on every window.

49:24.545 --> 49:26.130
The winters here are brutal.

49:26.213 --> 49:28.508
Glass of water.

49:30.468 --> 49:31.510
Can I use your phone,

49:31.594 --> 49:33.888
just to call my parents
and tell them I'm okay?

49:33.971 --> 49:35.515
Yeah, sure.

49:40.728 --> 49:42.229
Here, let me take that.

49:42.312 --> 49:49.153
And, uh, there's a chair
right behind you now. Okay.

49:52.156 --> 49:53.824
-You want help to dial?
-Oh, no.

49:53.908 --> 49:55.117
Okay.

50:35.407 --> 50:38.744
It just keeps ringing.
They're probably on the other line.

50:38.827 --> 50:42.081
Well, we'll call them again tomorrow.
We don't want 'em to worry.

50:43.332 --> 50:44.375
So...

50:45.125 --> 50:47.086
long day for you, must be tired.

50:47.169 --> 50:48.838
-Can I show you downstairs?
-Yeah.

50:48.921 --> 50:49.964
All right.

50:54.760 --> 50:58.264
Okay, it's two sets of stairs.

50:58.347 --> 51:00.015
First one's the easy one.

51:00.808 --> 51:03.518
There's a handrail on your left.

51:04.687 --> 51:06.355
Okay, got it?

51:07.898 --> 51:10.400
And then there's a spiral coming up.

51:13.862 --> 51:16.448
Okay. Here, you're about halfway down.

51:21.704 --> 51:23.330
Oh... I'll take your bag.

51:23.413 --> 51:25.124
Sorry.

51:26.083 --> 51:27.459
Smells like rock.

51:28.753 --> 51:30.254
Shale.

51:30.337 --> 51:31.714
Here.

51:31.797 --> 51:33.423
I built this lab myself.

51:34.508 --> 51:36.551
Okay, there's a big step coming up.

51:38.804 --> 51:40.055
Is that running water?

51:40.139 --> 51:43.475
Yeah. It's a natural spring.
I just left it.

51:43.558 --> 51:45.811
Never the same river twice, as they say.

51:47.021 --> 51:49.607
And... hold on, here we are.

51:52.735 --> 51:54.111
Okay.

51:54.194 --> 51:56.614
There's a bed three steps ahead of you.
Turn around.

51:57.823 --> 51:58.866
Okay.

52:05.497 --> 52:09.669
You are an incredible asset, Prairie.

52:09.752 --> 52:15.758
I'm... I'm so lucky that I met you,
and to be working with you.

52:18.761 --> 52:20.054
Thank you.

52:24.099 --> 52:25.267
You get some rest.

52:26.101 --> 52:27.186
Good night.

52:59.760 --> 53:00.803
Hap?

53:15.234 --> 53:16.819
Okay, okay.

53:16.902 --> 53:18.404
Let me walk you through this,

53:18.487 --> 53:20.739
'cause I know where your head's at.

53:20.823 --> 53:22.157
"This is not happening."

53:22.241 --> 53:23.408
It is.

53:24.409 --> 53:25.745
"This is a dream."

53:25.828 --> 53:27.662
You are wide awake.

53:27.747 --> 53:29.081
"Someone will find me."

53:30.332 --> 53:32.626
"Why am I locked in a cage?"

53:34.378 --> 53:37.840
Well... you'll find out soon enough.

53:38.465 --> 53:42.886
It may be a while
before he comes for you.

53:42.970 --> 53:46.306
And as you think about
every step that led you here,

53:46.390 --> 53:51.645
you'll eventually realize
it's no one's fault but your own.

53:52.897 --> 53:56.859
Your thoughts are gonna
try to take you down. Don't let them.

53:58.027 --> 53:59.736
You'll find your freedom.

53:59.820 --> 54:01.113
In sleep.

54:01.781 --> 54:03.282
In your dreams.

54:04.741 --> 54:06.701
It's how we stay sane.

54:10.330 --> 54:11.581
What's your name?

54:15.461 --> 54:16.837
Prairie.

54:19.464 --> 54:20.883
Prairie.
