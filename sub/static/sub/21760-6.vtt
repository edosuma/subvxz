We gotta get this cake baked

01:31.880 --> 01:33.500
before Anita
comes home from work.

01:33.500 --> 01:35.000
Aggh!

01:35.000 --> 01:37.670
So, what do you think, Rollster?

01:37.670 --> 01:40.620
German chocolate
or cinnamon spice?

01:42.880 --> 01:44.920
Both, huh?

01:44.920 --> 01:46.580
Well, that's an idea.

01:46.580 --> 01:48.210
Yeah, maybe we could
combine them

01:48.210 --> 01:50.830
and make one big German cinnamon
chocolate spice cake, huh?

01:52.250 --> 01:54.540
Why are we baking her
a cake now?

01:54.540 --> 01:56.460
She hasn't won
"Designer of the Year,"

01:56.460 --> 01:57.790
she's only
been nominated.

01:57.790 --> 02:00.790
It is an honor
just to be nominated.

02:00.790 --> 02:02.830
Of course, winning
gives you the added joy

02:02.830 --> 02:05.120
of rubbing
everybody's nose in it.

02:05.120 --> 02:09.170
Well, win or lose, Anita's
really gonna love this cake.

02:09.170 --> 02:13.330
I just hope Cruella doesn't
keep her working all night.

02:13.330 --> 02:16.960
man: But, Ms. De Vil,
it's almost midnight.

02:16.960 --> 02:19.500
We can't keep everyone
working all night.

02:19.500 --> 02:21.750
Can't

02:21.750 --> 02:23.790
The only thing
I can't do,

02:23.790 --> 02:25.580
you simple-headed
gherkin,

02:25.580 --> 02:27.710
is lose the "Designer
of the Year" award!

02:27.710 --> 02:30.380
No one leaves until
I get the call
from Puffin

02:30.380 --> 02:31.620
telling me I've won.

02:31.620 --> 02:35.580
I want all my servants--
uh, employees--

02:35.580 --> 02:37.380
to have the opportunity
to grovel

02:37.380 --> 02:39.460
at my
award-winning feet.

02:39.460 --> 02:43.290
Oh, well, you're
certain to win,
Ms. De Vil.

02:46.080 --> 02:48.460
Well, of course
I'm certain to win.

02:48.460 --> 02:51.880
Didn't I bribe
every judge in town
to get the nomination?

02:51.880 --> 02:55.170
Yes, ma'am, but they say
Puffin's incorruptible,

02:55.170 --> 02:56.960
and he makes
the final decision and...

02:59.290 --> 03:04.040
Then I'll just have to make him
an offer he can't refuse.

03:13.790 --> 03:17.420
Well, my dear, are we being
brilliant as usual?

03:17.420 --> 03:20.710
Yes, I can see we are.

03:20.710 --> 03:22.880
You know, I can never
thank you enough

03:22.880 --> 03:24.540
for letting me
work here, Cruella.

03:25.750 --> 03:28.080
No, my dear,
you can't, can you?

03:29.670 --> 03:31.250
Answer it, Anita!

03:31.250 --> 03:35.120
It may be that
wonderfully dim
husband of yours.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.710
Hello?

03:36.710 --> 03:38.830
Why, yes, Mr. Puffin,
this is--

03:38.830 --> 03:42.290
Hello, Puffin,
darling!

03:42.290 --> 03:44.620
Isn't it me
you want
to speak to?

03:44.620 --> 03:46.830
Why, yes, Cruella.

03:46.830 --> 03:48.330
I knew it!

03:48.330 --> 03:52.290
Listen, before I make
the public announcement,

03:52.290 --> 03:54.000
I wanted to congratulate you

03:54.000 --> 03:57.620
for having
the Designer of the Year
working for you.

03:57.620 --> 04:00.960
Darling, I don't
work for me.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.750
I am me!

04:04.120 --> 04:06.120
Oh, Cruella,
you're such a caution.

04:06.120 --> 04:07.710
No, darling, not you at all.

04:07.710 --> 04:10.830
Anita's the new
Designer of the Year.

04:13.710 --> 04:15.620
Cruella, are you all right?

04:17.420 --> 04:20.460
Of course,
Anita, dear!

04:20.460 --> 04:23.120
I'm just so
full of emotion,

04:23.120 --> 04:26.380
I can barely
express my feelings.

04:27.790 --> 04:31.040
Dizzy, where are you?

04:32.830 --> 04:34.710
Clean up this mess!

04:34.710 --> 04:35.790
Yes, Ms. De Vil.

04:35.790 --> 04:37.580
Cruella: Memo to myself.

04:37.580 --> 04:39.460
Persuade Puffin
that if I don't get

04:39.460 --> 04:42.290
the "Designer of the Year"
award,

04:42.290 --> 04:43.750
no one will.

04:44.580 --> 04:47.210
Roger: Oh, Cruella wouldn't
give you the day off

04:47.210 --> 04:48.750
for your award presentation?

04:48.750 --> 04:50.830
Anita: She's a little jealous.

04:50.830 --> 04:54.540
Roger: Jealous? She's one taco
short of a combination plate.

04:54.540 --> 04:57.750
Anita: Roger, relax.
Everything's under control.

04:57.750 --> 04:59.170
I have my dress, my makeup,

04:59.170 --> 05:02.080
everything I'll need
for the ceremony right here.

05:02.080 --> 05:03.500
I'll get ready after work

05:03.500 --> 05:06.620
and meet you at Topstown Plaza
in plenty of time.

05:06.620 --> 05:08.960
Roger: Well, I just
don't want you to miss

05:08.960 --> 05:11.460
any of
your well-deserved hoopla.

05:13.330 --> 05:15.330
Yeccch! Mush!

05:15.330 --> 05:17.670
Yuck! Double mush!

05:19.960 --> 05:21.460
Just think.

05:21.460 --> 05:24.620
For one brief moment,
the name "Anita Dearly"

05:24.620 --> 05:27.670
will stand for all that is pure
and lovely

05:27.670 --> 05:29.830
and must be dry-cleaned.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.750
We'll all be on TV.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.710
Which is my best side?

05:35.710 --> 05:37.540
You're sitting
on it.

05:37.540 --> 05:42.380
Oh, Topstown Plaza's got
a five-star kitchen.

05:42.380 --> 05:46.620
Oh, I'm getting goose bumps
just thinking about it.

05:46.620 --> 05:50.330
Thinking about it
is all any of you
are ever gonna do.

05:50.330 --> 05:53.380
So, what exactly are you
trying to say?

05:53.380 --> 05:56.750
They're not taking us.

05:58.960 --> 06:02.290
Lucky: But there's a difference
between not taking us

06:02.290 --> 06:05.210
and thinking
they're not taking us.

06:05.210 --> 06:06.380
Come on!

06:07.500 --> 06:09.170
-Yay!

06:16.290 --> 06:19.170
Puffin: Hmm.
Now let me get this straight.

06:19.170 --> 06:22.670
Your anonymous benefactor
wants me to recognize

06:22.670 --> 06:25.830
Cruella de Vil
as the Designer of the Year?

06:25.830 --> 06:27.750
That's right.
And here's her--

06:27.750 --> 06:29.170
His.

06:29.170 --> 06:31.580
His anonymous
check.

06:31.580 --> 06:33.080
Please ignore
the signature.

06:33.080 --> 06:36.670
And if I don't do it?

06:37.580 --> 06:41.290
Then we're to tie you
into a knot no one can undo.

06:41.290 --> 06:42.830
Say, like a half sheepshank.

06:42.830 --> 06:43.880
Windsor.

06:43.880 --> 06:44.960
Half sheepshank.

06:44.960 --> 06:47.540
Where you gonna get
sheep this time of year?

06:47.540 --> 06:48.540
Right.

06:51.750 --> 06:53.620
Well, let's get this
over with, then.

06:53.620 --> 06:55.250
I have a busy day.

06:57.580 --> 07:00.710
He wants to get it
over with.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.460
He has a busy day.

07:06.330 --> 07:08.040
Waaaah!

07:09.580 --> 07:14.380
Oh! For a guy named Puffin,
he sure packs a mighty wallop.

07:14.380 --> 07:15.540
Yow!

07:20.500 --> 07:22.040
Lucky: Stop squirming!

07:22.040 --> 07:23.670
Rolly: Hey, watch it!

07:23.670 --> 07:27.580
Cadpig: I can't help it.
I'm sitting on a high heel.

07:27.580 --> 07:28.830
Oh!

07:28.830 --> 07:30.250
I never should have drunk

07:30.250 --> 07:32.500
all that water at breakfast.

07:32.500 --> 07:35.580
We've been here so long,
I'm seeing spots.

07:35.580 --> 07:38.000
Lucky: Come on,
it's time for supper.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.500
Fresh air!

07:45.580 --> 07:46.710
Lucky, you'll get caught!

07:46.710 --> 07:49.540
Who is gonna catch me?

07:49.540 --> 07:52.500
Cruella: Well,
what have we here?

07:54.830 --> 07:57.540
How dare you show up
looking like this!

07:57.540 --> 07:59.960
Get into my office
before someone sees you.

07:59.960 --> 08:02.790
What's that old bag of bones
up to now?

08:05.040 --> 08:06.120
Ouch!

08:10.170 --> 08:13.500
You ruined my plan.
This upsets me.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.210
Normally, I would
do away with you,

08:15.210 --> 08:18.420
but I'll need you
for my alternative plan.

08:18.420 --> 08:22.460
Oh, Anita's going to
look beautiful in this.

08:22.460 --> 08:25.380
Too bad no one
will see her.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.000
Huh?

08:29.250 --> 08:32.460
Oh, it's beautiful, Cruella.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.380
This is very kind
of you.

08:35.380 --> 08:37.500
Mwah!

08:38.620 --> 08:40.380
Shush, my dear!

08:40.380 --> 08:43.380
You are representing
the House of De Vil.

08:43.380 --> 08:45.330
We want you looking
your best.

08:45.330 --> 08:48.620
I'll hang this old
rag in my closet

08:48.620 --> 08:51.120
so it won't get
any more wrinkled.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.920
She's up
to something,
all right.

08:53.920 --> 08:55.580
Rolly: What
should we do?

08:55.580 --> 08:58.670
We've got to help Anita,
that's what we should do.

08:58.670 --> 09:01.380
all: Yeah! Let's help Anita!

09:01.380 --> 09:04.250
Lucky: Rolly, you and Spot
keep an eye on Anita.

09:04.250 --> 09:06.580
Cadpig and I will watch
old witch face!

09:10.540 --> 09:12.380
Now, you finish
getting ready, dear.

09:12.380 --> 09:13.710
Everyone's gone home,

09:13.710 --> 09:16.750
so you'll have the entire place
to yourself.

09:18.330 --> 09:21.790
And you'll have it
for quite some time.

09:39.420 --> 09:42.170
Are you sure you can
pull it off, Andre?

09:42.170 --> 09:45.290
Andre: I have turned
elephants into dinosaurs

09:45.290 --> 09:48.000
in the name of entertainment,
but ziss...

09:48.000 --> 09:50.120
is a real challenge.

09:50.120 --> 09:51.620
Aaah!

09:57.620 --> 10:01.420
I'll do anything to be
Designer of the Year.

10:01.420 --> 10:04.790
S'il vous plaît... commence.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.000
Yipes!

11:23.250 --> 11:26.170
Yaaaaaah!

11:35.040 --> 11:36.540
both: Huh?

11:45.960 --> 11:47.330
Voilà.

11:47.330 --> 11:51.420
I don't believe it.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.380
Excellent!

11:54.380 --> 11:57.960
You are a genius, Andre!

11:57.960 --> 11:59.880
Uh-uh!

11:59.880 --> 12:01.380
There'll be no sweating,

12:01.380 --> 12:04.830
or you'll be wearing
your new face on your shoes.

12:04.830 --> 12:06.420
Don't worry, Andre,

12:06.420 --> 12:08.580
When Anita Dearly
refuses the award

12:08.580 --> 12:11.170
and accepts it
for her dear Cruella,

12:11.170 --> 12:14.330
she'll be cool as ice.

12:17.540 --> 12:19.330
We gotta tell Anita.

12:29.120 --> 12:31.120
Hello

12:31.120 --> 12:32.580
I'm locked in!

12:32.580 --> 12:34.000
Hello?

12:34.000 --> 12:37.500
Ohh! There has to be
a phone working somewhere.

12:39.290 --> 12:41.620
Why do these things
always happen to me?

12:51.500 --> 12:54.330
Lucky: Rolly! Spot!

12:54.330 --> 12:56.540
-Ooh!

13:02.080 --> 13:03.790
Lucky, is that you?

13:03.790 --> 13:07.080
What's going on?
Why is the door closed?

13:07.080 --> 13:08.790
We're locked in!

13:08.790 --> 13:10.580
And the phones
are all dead.

13:10.580 --> 13:13.380
She's gonna miss
the awards ceremony.

13:13.380 --> 13:16.040
No, Anita will be there,
all right.

13:16.040 --> 13:19.120
But it won't be the right Anita.

13:23.290 --> 13:26.750
Oh, I feel like
a new woman.

13:26.750 --> 13:28.920
Because I am a new woman.

13:30.620 --> 13:35.250
Now, just stay cool and no one
will ever know the difference.

13:35.250 --> 13:38.040
Relax. You boys
can go home now.

13:38.040 --> 13:41.710
Cruella de Vil will
handle things from now on.

13:41.710 --> 13:43.830
Especially that award.

13:49.120 --> 13:52.080
Rolly, Spot, you get
Anita out of there,

13:52.080 --> 13:54.120
we'll stop Cruella.

14:08.670 --> 14:10.120
Oh!

14:11.250 --> 14:12.880
Uh...

14:12.880 --> 14:14.880
Oh.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.250
Hmm.

14:16.250 --> 14:18.830
Ugh, disgusting.

14:18.830 --> 14:21.540
But I'll do anything
to get that award.

14:21.540 --> 14:25.040
Even drive Anita's, uh...
car.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.170
Uggh!

14:41.540 --> 14:44.920
Oh! Dirty little old jalopy.

14:47.920 --> 14:50.330
Aaaaah!

14:54.620 --> 14:57.540
Rolly: Ohh!
Got any ideas?

14:57.540 --> 14:59.670
Uh, this is one
of those times

14:59.670 --> 15:02.040
when I wish my head
worked as good
as my mouth.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.960
That's it!

15:08.960 --> 15:10.000
What?

15:10.000 --> 15:11.420
What!

15:21.170 --> 15:24.120
Come on, Anita,
where are you?!

15:28.000 --> 15:29.380
Anita?

15:31.120 --> 15:33.460
Oh, sweetie,
you made it!

15:33.460 --> 15:35.080
Mwah!

15:38.460 --> 15:40.830
Ah, oh,
you taste funny.

15:40.830 --> 15:45.420
Oh, it's a new lipstick
I'm testing for Cruella.

15:45.420 --> 15:47.210
Kiss of death.

15:47.210 --> 15:48.920
Yeah, some lipstick.

15:48.920 --> 15:52.210
It even makes you sound
like the old bag.

15:52.210 --> 15:56.080
Reginald,
what a nice thing to say.

15:56.080 --> 16:00.040
I've always wanted
to be as much like
that wonderful woman

16:00.040 --> 16:01.500
as possible.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.210
What a great
imitation of Cruella.

16:05.210 --> 16:07.380
Now, come on,
we've gotta hurry.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.290
Hurry, Cadpig!

16:13.290 --> 16:16.580
Lucky, Cadpig,
what are you doing here?

16:21.790 --> 16:24.750
You guys are not
supposed to be here.

16:24.750 --> 16:27.500
Ugh! He doesn't
get it.

16:28.920 --> 16:30.670
Whoa!

16:32.750 --> 16:34.880
Ohh! Ooh!

16:34.880 --> 16:36.330
Let go of that dress,

16:36.330 --> 16:40.000
you spotty little pile
of bad smells!

16:40.000 --> 16:41.460
Uh... huh?

16:41.460 --> 16:44.500
I mean, let go
of mommy's dress,

16:44.500 --> 16:47.880
you sweet little
spotted monster.

16:47.880 --> 16:49.250
Come here, you guys.

16:49.250 --> 16:52.250
That's right, uh, darling.

16:52.250 --> 16:55.580
You watch the mongrels
while I get my award.

16:55.580 --> 16:57.920
Kiss-kiss!

16:57.920 --> 17:00.500
Boy, success does change people.

17:03.750 --> 17:05.880
Rolly: Easy!

17:05.880 --> 17:08.040
Steady!

17:08.040 --> 17:09.670
Uggh!

17:09.670 --> 17:11.670
What do I do now?

17:11.670 --> 17:15.000
Just wiggle your beak
till you feel some clicks,

17:15.000 --> 17:16.460
and then turn your head
to the right.

17:16.460 --> 17:19.710
Okay, I'm doing it.

17:22.710 --> 17:26.120
Rolly
What are you doing here?

17:26.120 --> 17:28.290
And how did you
get the door open?

17:29.380 --> 17:32.000
Pretty clever
using my beak
as a lock pick.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.040
Quick thinking,
Rolly.

17:38.830 --> 17:42.290
Oh, no, someone's
taken my car!

17:42.290 --> 17:46.120
Well, Cruella will understand.
It was an emergency.

18:07.580 --> 18:08.880
Yeah!

18:18.790 --> 18:21.040
officer: Whoa! A miscreant.

18:29.250 --> 18:30.750
Something wrong?

18:30.750 --> 18:33.790
I thought the husband
of the winner would
rate a better table.

18:33.790 --> 18:37.040
The husband of the winner
usually doesn't bring pets

18:37.040 --> 18:39.500
wearing his suspenders.

18:39.500 --> 18:42.460
Never mind him, it's time.

18:42.460 --> 18:47.040
It is now my pleasure
to introduce to you

18:47.040 --> 18:52.080
the lovely and talented winner
of "Designer of the Year."

18:53.330 --> 18:56.620
Stop talking about her
and give me the award,

18:56.620 --> 18:58.540
you pompous polliwog.

18:58.540 --> 19:00.380
What do we do, Lucky?

19:00.380 --> 19:02.210
I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

19:02.210 --> 19:05.960
Puffin: Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a distinct honor...

19:05.960 --> 19:07.960
Uh-uh, there will
be no sweating,

19:07.960 --> 19:10.750
or you'll be wearing
your new face
on your shoes.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.960
...an honor bestowed on one
who's fresh, yet not pushy,

19:13.960 --> 19:15.750
clever, yet not...

19:15.750 --> 19:18.040
I got it!

19:18.040 --> 19:19.330
Follow me!

19:20.420 --> 19:21.960
Whoa! Ugh!

19:21.960 --> 19:23.500
Wait!

19:23.500 --> 19:26.330
Ooh-ooh.
A little drafty. Ugh!

19:26.330 --> 19:29.120
To the lighting booth,
quick!

19:29.120 --> 19:33.830
And let me add, finally,
this lady is as sweet

19:33.830 --> 19:36.540
as she is brilliant.

19:36.540 --> 19:39.420
Thank you for
those kind words.

19:39.420 --> 19:42.210
But I don't deserve
this great honor.

19:42.210 --> 19:45.330
I'm going to accept this award
for the rightful winner,

19:45.330 --> 19:49.170
the person without whom
I would have done nothing.

19:49.170 --> 19:50.670
Me!

19:50.670 --> 19:53.380
I mean, my... my employer

19:53.380 --> 19:56.710
and close personal friend,
Cruella de Vil.

19:56.710 --> 19:58.120
Huh?

19:58.120 --> 19:59.710
Whoa!

20:03.080 --> 20:05.500
Ohhhh!

20:05.500 --> 20:07.420
Now I'm mad.

20:09.040 --> 20:12.500
Hey, what are you tire-biters
doing here?

20:12.500 --> 20:16.120
Oww! Oooh! Oh!
Hey, let go! Aaah!

20:16.120 --> 20:19.290
Okay, Cruella,
you think you're so hot?

20:19.290 --> 20:21.880
Take this!

20:21.880 --> 20:24.120
Through thick and thin,

20:24.120 --> 20:26.420
it was always Cruella de Vil

20:26.420 --> 20:27.830
who pulled me through.

20:27.830 --> 20:30.670
Without her genius,
I am nothing.

20:30.670 --> 20:32.880
She taught me
everything I know.

20:36.750 --> 20:39.540
Oh, I hope I'm not too late!

20:41.670 --> 20:43.040
Missed her.

20:43.040 --> 20:46.670
Well, she has to
come out sometime.

20:46.670 --> 20:50.830
No, Ms. de Vil's
little girl Cruella

20:50.830 --> 20:53.670
never takes anything
lying down.

20:56.460 --> 20:58.960
What's the matter
with you insects?

20:58.960 --> 21:01.830
Don't you know a winner
when you see one?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.830
What

21:04.830 --> 21:07.920
Oh, no, I'm melting!

21:07.920 --> 21:09.750
I'm melting!

21:09.750 --> 21:11.500
Whaaaaa!

21:13.620 --> 21:14.790
Cruella?

21:14.790 --> 21:17.380
But then
where's Anita Dearly?

21:17.380 --> 21:18.710
Anita, breathless:
Here I am!

21:24.830 --> 21:28.120
Yeah!
Way to go, babe!

21:30.080 --> 21:32.670
Here you are, my dear.

21:32.670 --> 21:35.380
man: Oh, it's just
so wonderful!

21:35.380 --> 21:37.830
You know,
I really would like
to thank Cruella.

21:37.830 --> 21:40.500
I couldn't have
won it without her.

21:40.500 --> 21:43.000
Don't. You'll spoil
her tantrum.

21:45.330 --> 21:46.620
Uggh!

21:46.620 --> 21:50.790
Well, at least I get
to drive my own car home.

21:50.790 --> 21:51.960
Your car?

21:51.960 --> 21:54.880
Well, of course
it's my car.

21:54.880 --> 21:58.670
Who else around here
is classy enough
to drive this?

21:58.670 --> 22:02.210
Speeding, failure
to stop at a red light,

22:02.210 --> 22:03.960
failure to stop
for a fire hydrant,

22:03.960 --> 22:05.880
failure to acknowledge
police siren,

22:05.880 --> 22:07.830
resisting arrest...

22:07.830 --> 22:08.920
Ugggh!

22:08.920 --> 22:11.330
Glamour
is not pretty.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.500
Failure to...
