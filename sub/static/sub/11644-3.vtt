00:02.680 --> 00:04.839
I was on the roof
dressed as a superhero.

00:04.840 --> 00:05.359
Yeah, then what happened?

00:05.360 --> 00:07.159
Nothing.

00:07.160 --> 00:08.159
Who is this guy?

00:08.160 --> 00:09.719
I don't know.
He's following me.

00:09.720 --> 00:11.519
What does he actually know?

00:11.520 --> 00:15.519
He seems to know everything.
We need to find him.

00:15.600 --> 00:18.559
I'm going to take a shit in his bed.

00:18.560 --> 00:19.599
Who are you?

00:19.600 --> 00:21.319
Why are you in my flat?

00:21.320 --> 00:25.319
It's you!

00:50.040 --> 00:50.839
Give me the bag!

00:50.840 --> 00:51.719
Ow, my necklace!

00:51.720 --> 00:55.719
Give me the bag, bitch!

01:13.200 --> 01:17.199
You're touching me?

01:18.640 --> 01:22.639
Who are you?

01:38.440 --> 01:40.599
# The city breathing

01:40.600 --> 01:42.599
# The people churning

01:42.600 --> 01:44.079
# The conversating

01:44.080 --> 01:48.079
# The price is what?

02:00.240 --> 02:02.079
# The conversating

02:02.080 --> 02:04.039
# This place is heaven

02:04.040 --> 02:08.038
And if you see them... #

02:19.320 --> 02:20.999
Right.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.719
Put all this shit in that skip.

02:22.720 --> 02:25.999
Would it kill you
to dress it up a bit?

02:26.000 --> 02:29.999
Put all this shit
in that skip, please.

02:30.080 --> 02:34.079
Sometimes I wonder if you take
this job entirely seriously.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.999
I'm 100% committed
to yourongoing rehabilitation.

02:39.280 --> 02:43.279
It occupies my every waking minute.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.599
Er, where are you going?

02:48.600 --> 02:52.599
For a coffee and a Danish.

02:52.880 --> 02:56.879
Smug bastard.

02:57.400 --> 03:01.399
Well, this is a big load of wank!

03:02.280 --> 03:06.279
Ah, ha, ha. Nice.

03:11.520 --> 03:13.559
So what are you doing later?

03:13.560 --> 03:16.399
I'm going to get
mytattoo touched up.

03:16.400 --> 03:19.839
Sounds painful! Maybe I should
come along and hold your hand.

03:19.840 --> 03:22.919
Yeah, all right.

03:22.920 --> 03:26.919
'Those two going together.
How's that ever going to work?'

03:37.040 --> 03:41.039
Have you seen any more
of that guy in the mask?

03:41.080 --> 03:43.319
Not since last week.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.359
Why do you think helead us
to that girl's flat?

03:45.360 --> 03:49.359
Maybe he wanted us to know
that he knew that we were on to him.

03:50.160 --> 03:53.719
Or there could be another
totally different explanation.

03:53.720 --> 03:56.399
You're supposed
toknow about this stuff.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.799
Why are you interested in him?

03:58.800 --> 04:01.959
Because I just am, all right.

04:01.960 --> 04:05.959
What?

04:45.760 --> 04:49.759
I've seen some weird shit
over the last few weeks, but this...

04:50.840 --> 04:54.799
This goes against
the very laws of nature.

04:54.800 --> 04:57.559
It's very wrong.

04:57.560 --> 05:00.279
It looks like
it'sfading or something.

05:00.280 --> 05:03.319
Yeah. It just needs
alittle touching up, no?

05:03.320 --> 05:05.399
I can do that foryou now
if you want?

05:05.400 --> 05:08.239
Yeah. Nice one.

05:08.240 --> 05:12.239
Hey, Simon. You should get one.

05:12.920 --> 05:15.039
I have a phobia of needles.

05:15.040 --> 05:18.239
Listen, I haven't seen you
around town lately.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.959
Nah, I've got curfew.

05:19.960 --> 05:23.439
So, whose cock is this?

05:23.440 --> 05:24.719
That's mine.

05:24.720 --> 05:27.359
Really? I'm not being funny but,

05:27.360 --> 05:30.239
why would you do something like that?

05:30.240 --> 05:33.359
It expresses how I felt about
my girlfriend when she left me.

05:33.360 --> 05:36.119
You couldn't just get drunk
and sleep with a prostitute?

05:36.120 --> 05:40.119
Each one of these
means something to me, my friend.

05:40.680 --> 05:44.439
When I ink my skin, I feel it.

05:44.440 --> 05:46.119
Hey, man.

05:46.120 --> 05:50.119
Whatever gets you off!

05:52.120 --> 05:55.679
Listen, when your curfew ends, give
me a call. I'll buy you a drink.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.999
Hey, Kelly.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.519
How about this one?

05:59.520 --> 06:01.759
Would you fancy me
even more if I had this,

06:01.760 --> 06:05.759
or does it look a bit gay to you?

06:05.800 --> 06:06.879
Oh!

06:06.880 --> 06:10.639
I mean it would look gay on me, just
because I've got a beautiful face.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.639
You get away with it, with your face.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.599
I'm not saying you're ugly.

06:15.600 --> 06:18.239
You've looked in the mirror.

06:18.240 --> 06:22.239
No offence, man.

06:28.600 --> 06:32.599
None taken.

06:40.360 --> 06:43.159
So, how about you and me
go get a drink?

06:43.160 --> 06:44.439
Where do you want to go?

06:44.440 --> 06:46.359
Who's asking you? I'm talking to him.

06:46.360 --> 06:48.679
Look! This is more of a boy's night.

06:48.680 --> 06:50.679
We're talking some quality man time.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.999
Beer, football...
Maybe some wrestling.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.319
Why are you being such a dick?

06:55.320 --> 06:59.239
Come on, man.
Let's go watch some wrestling.

06:59.240 --> 07:03.239
We don't need her.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.999
I thought we were going to abar
to watch some wrestling?

07:18.200 --> 07:19.799
Nah, who wants to go to a bar?

07:19.800 --> 07:22.679
We've got everything we need,
right here. Come on.

07:22.680 --> 07:24.199
Make yourself comfortable.

07:24.200 --> 07:28.199
Take off your jacket. Relax.

07:41.120 --> 07:42.799
So, this is really cool, huh?

07:42.800 --> 07:46.039
A couple of good looking
young fellas, a few beers.

07:46.040 --> 07:50.039
That's good times.

07:51.320 --> 07:55.319
Hey, why don't I put some music on?

08:02.600 --> 08:06.599
Oh!

08:07.600 --> 08:10.719
Oh, yeah.

08:10.720 --> 08:14.719
Careless Whisper

08:31.960 --> 08:35.958
Wanker!

08:38.559 --> 08:40.519
Are you talking to me?

08:40.520 --> 08:42.519
Yeah, that's right.

08:42.520 --> 08:46.519
Talking to you,
you ugly, rat-faced fuck.

08:47.280 --> 08:48.919
You're going to get a slap.

08:48.920 --> 08:51.679
Come on then. Save me, you prick!

08:51.680 --> 08:55.679
Where you going? Come here!

09:10.200 --> 09:12.319
I just want to talk to you.

09:12.320 --> 09:13.439
Really?

09:13.440 --> 09:17.239
I thought you might want to break
into my flat and shit in my bed.

09:17.240 --> 09:18.759
That wasn't me.
We got the wrong flat.

09:18.760 --> 09:22.599
You tell your little friend,
he owes me a new mattress.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.239
He wiped his arse on my pyjamas.

09:24.240 --> 09:28.239
That's the kind of thing he does.
He's not right in the head.

09:32.440 --> 09:35.839
What?

09:35.840 --> 09:39.839
I know this is going
to sound weird and crap but...

09:40.000 --> 09:43.999
I feel like I know you.

09:44.320 --> 09:48.319
You feel like you know me!

09:49.680 --> 09:53.679
You smooth bastard.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.479
Well, you can help yourself.

09:56.480 --> 10:00.399
Just pull my knickers up when
you're done. I'll order a pizza.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.239
Are you always such a bitch?

10:03.240 --> 10:07.239
Are you always such a weird twat?

10:08.520 --> 10:09.639
Are we done?

10:09.640 --> 10:13.639
Yeah.

10:26.160 --> 10:29.479
I want to know everything
there is to know about you.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.399
Like what?

10:31.400 --> 10:35.399
Anything.

10:36.520 --> 10:40.519
I just bought the Battlestar
Galactica DVD box set.

10:41.520 --> 10:44.159
Tell me about your
first sexual experience.

10:44.160 --> 10:48.159
Do you want to hear about mine?

10:49.760 --> 10:51.599
It was a family camping holiday.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.199
One of my mum's friends came with us

10:54.200 --> 10:58.119
and one night I felt her hand
sliding into my sleeping bag,

10:58.120 --> 11:02.119
like a warm, friendly snake.

11:02.600 --> 11:03.639
Sss!

11:03.640 --> 11:06.879
Then she grabs my cock
and starts wanking me off.

11:06.880 --> 11:09.639
She had lovely little hands.
Like a midget's.

11:09.640 --> 11:11.119
Your hand's on my leg?

11:11.120 --> 11:15.119
Shh.

11:19.720 --> 11:20.999
What are you doing?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.759
You don't know how much
I've always wanted to do that.

11:23.760 --> 11:26.159
Feel my heart. It's racing.

11:26.160 --> 11:28.319
It's OK, it's OK. I'll be gentle.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.799
Why don't we slip your trousers off?

11:30.800 --> 11:33.159
It's OK, we don't
have to fight any longer.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.799
I want to see it.

11:35.800 --> 11:39.319
Simon. Simon, don't go.
We don't have to go all the way.

11:39.320 --> 11:41.239
We can just cuddle.

11:41.240 --> 11:44.279
And when you're ready,
we can do some dry humping.

11:44.280 --> 11:48.279
Call me!

14:01.233 --> 14:04.712
How's your head?

14:04.713 --> 14:07.072
What the fuck is going on?

14:07.073 --> 14:09.912
Since when did you run around,
jumping off buildings?

14:09.913 --> 14:12.352
Ever since I travelled
back from the future.

14:12.353 --> 14:14.552
Really, did you?

14:14.553 --> 14:18.552
Yes.

14:19.593 --> 14:23.592
Seriously?

14:26.713 --> 14:28.112
How does this work?

14:28.113 --> 14:29.512
There's two of you.

14:29.513 --> 14:31.152
There's the Simon you know,

14:31.153 --> 14:35.072
and there's the future Simon.

14:35.073 --> 14:37.752
Me.

14:37.753 --> 14:41.752
You're so different.

14:43.433 --> 14:46.912
A lot happens between now and then.

14:46.913 --> 14:48.712
You touched me.

14:48.713 --> 14:52.712
Why doesn't my power work on you?

14:55.033 --> 14:58.432
Things are different in the future.

14:58.433 --> 15:02.432
What's with all the photographs
and clocks and...

15:05.233 --> 15:09.232
There are things that need
to happen at certain times.

15:09.673 --> 15:13.672
I'm here to make sure they do.

15:20.913 --> 15:24.912
Does it hurt?

15:29.473 --> 15:33.472
I should go.

15:41.433 --> 15:44.032
No matter what happens...

15:44.033 --> 15:48.032
you can never tell Simon I'm him.

15:48.393 --> 15:49.872
You can't tell any of them.

15:49.873 --> 15:51.512
Not Curtis, not anyone.

15:51.513 --> 15:55.272
It could change anything everything.

15:55.273 --> 15:59.272
Promise me you won't tell.

16:11.473 --> 16:12.552
He kissed me.

16:12.553 --> 16:14.352
Nathan kissed you?

16:14.353 --> 16:18.272
He put his tongue...in my mouth.

16:18.273 --> 16:20.232
He's a dickhead.
He's winding you up.

16:20.233 --> 16:22.872
He tried to take my trousers off.

16:22.873 --> 16:25.592
Are you taking the piss?

16:25.593 --> 16:28.592
He said he wanted to do some...

16:28.593 --> 16:29.912
..dry humping.

16:29.913 --> 16:31.152
What did you do?

16:31.153 --> 16:33.552
I left!

16:33.553 --> 16:37.552
Very quickly.

16:37.913 --> 16:41.232
If you open your heart,

16:41.233 --> 16:45.232
I know we could have something
really beautiful.

16:45.513 --> 16:48.072
Yours...

16:48.073 --> 16:49.752
..forever,

16:49.753 --> 16:52.232
Nathan.

16:52.233 --> 16:54.032
Jesus! Stop kicking me!

16:54.033 --> 16:56.352
What have I told you about
dicking around with Simon?

16:56.353 --> 16:58.472
Who's dicking around?
You put your tongue in his mouth!

16:58.473 --> 16:59.712
Ow! Jesus! All right.

16:59.713 --> 17:03.192
All right, so I got
a littlebit fresh with him.

17:03.193 --> 17:05.632
I was staring into
those big,beautiful eyes.

17:05.633 --> 17:06.712
He's like a...

17:06.713 --> 17:08.152
He's like a handsome shark.

17:08.153 --> 17:10.672
I couldn't help myself.

17:10.673 --> 17:11.872
I love him.

17:11.873 --> 17:12.712
You're a dick!

17:12.713 --> 17:15.112
Do my feelings for him
offend you? I'm sorry.

17:15.113 --> 17:18.271
Because they're true.
And pure... Well, they're true.

17:18.272 --> 17:21.392
I can't pretend any longer. I won't.

17:21.393 --> 17:25.271
'I never felt like this about anyone.
He completes me.'

17:25.272 --> 17:27.512
Er, that's from Jerry Maguire.

17:27.512 --> 17:28.872
Yeah, I know.

17:28.873 --> 17:30.912
I've watched it
fourtimes last night.

17:30.913 --> 17:34.152
It's like he's Tom and I'm Renee.

17:34.153 --> 17:36.272
Someone else
is the ugly,speccy kid.

17:36.273 --> 17:39.152
Are you trying to tell me
you're gay or something?

17:39.153 --> 17:42.072
Gay, straight, retarded. Why
do we put labels and everything?

17:42.073 --> 17:46.072
We do, all right? Or else no-one
will know what the fuck's going on.

17:47.713 --> 17:51.712
Is this why me and you
haven't got it together?

17:51.833 --> 17:54.352
Maybe he's what has been
missing from my life.

17:54.353 --> 17:56.352
Why do you think
I was alwaysso mean to him?

17:56.353 --> 17:57.872
Because you're a wanker.

17:57.873 --> 18:01.872
No, it is because it's much easier
to humiliate, degrade

18:01.953 --> 18:04.192
and just generally
shit allover someone

18:04.193 --> 18:08.192
than it is to admit
thatyou love them!

18:08.633 --> 18:12.632
# You won't believe what love can do

18:13.793 --> 18:17.792
# Until it happens to you. #

18:23.633 --> 18:25.032
Hi.

18:25.033 --> 18:28.472
I got you a drink.

18:28.473 --> 18:32.472
It's just a drink.

18:40.993 --> 18:44.992
Thank you.

18:45.153 --> 18:49.152
Do you ever think about the future?

18:50.273 --> 18:54.192
Do you think about...
what's goingto happen to us?

18:54.193 --> 18:58.032
All the time.

18:58.033 --> 19:00.752
And we need to be ready.

19:00.753 --> 19:03.112
What for?

19:03.113 --> 19:07.112
One day someone's going
to find out about us.

19:07.833 --> 19:11.832
Everything will change.

19:13.473 --> 19:16.952
I know you've looked out for us.
Killing the probation worker.

19:16.953 --> 19:20.952
The second one.

19:21.913 --> 19:24.872
I've never thanked you.

19:24.873 --> 19:28.312
I wanted you to know.

19:28.313 --> 19:32.312
Thanks.

19:33.993 --> 19:37.632
Why are you being so nice to me?

19:37.633 --> 19:41.112
I can be nice.

19:41.113 --> 19:45.112
Sometimes.

19:48.593 --> 19:52.592
Look, if I've ever been
a bitchto you...

19:54.153 --> 19:58.152
I'm sorry.

19:58.593 --> 20:02.592
I've never thought
you werea bitch.

20:04.313 --> 20:08.312
Sometimes I think it's difficult
for beautiful girls.

20:09.593 --> 20:13.592
People don't see past their looks.

20:21.953 --> 20:25.952
I should go.

20:46.473 --> 20:49.272
What's this?

20:49.273 --> 20:50.992
Read it.

20:50.993 --> 20:53.032
We'll take things slowly.

20:53.033 --> 20:56.712
When you're ready to develop the
physical side of our relationship,

20:56.713 --> 21:00.392
you just let me know. No pressure.

21:00.393 --> 21:01.432
Thanks.

21:01.433 --> 21:05.432
It's just so hard when
you'reso cute, and I'm so horny,

21:05.513 --> 21:08.352
and there's only
a couple of thinlayers of cotton

21:08.353 --> 21:12.352
separatingour genitals.

21:19.153 --> 21:23.152
Did you know that he had a tattoo
done with your name on it?

21:24.553 --> 21:28.552
No.

21:49.153 --> 21:50.192
Hey.

21:50.193 --> 21:51.552
Hiya.

21:51.553 --> 21:52.992
Everything all right
with the tattoo?

21:52.993 --> 21:54.032
It's fine.

21:54.033 --> 21:56.232
Know that guy I was with yesterday?
The gobby one?

21:56.233 --> 21:58.272
Is there something wrong with him?

21:58.273 --> 22:01.312
I think there probably is.

22:01.313 --> 22:02.472
Did you tattoo him?

22:02.473 --> 22:04.352
No.

22:04.353 --> 22:05.472
Why?

22:05.473 --> 22:09.072
Because he's got this tattoo
and I thought he might have come in.

22:09.073 --> 22:11.672
'She knows I did it.'

22:11.673 --> 22:13.472
You tattooed him, didn't you?

22:13.473 --> 22:17.472
Did you turn him into a gay?

22:18.633 --> 22:20.392
I always liked you.

22:20.393 --> 22:21.432
What?

22:21.433 --> 22:25.032
Why do you want to be with
a gobby little shit like him? Hm?

22:25.033 --> 22:26.552
Now, I can make you happy.

22:26.553 --> 22:27.672
You're just being weird.

22:27.673 --> 22:31.672
You can't make people gay
just because they're dickheads.

22:32.633 --> 22:33.672
What are you doing?

22:33.673 --> 22:35.992
I'm going to make you so...

22:35.993 --> 22:39.992
happy.

23:14.825 --> 23:18.424
Hi.

23:18.425 --> 23:22.424
Were you sniffing my knickers?

23:23.425 --> 23:25.384
You think I risked my life
travelling through the dimensions

23:25.385 --> 23:28.224
of time so I could sniff
your knickers?

23:28.225 --> 23:29.824
I don't know, did you?

23:29.825 --> 23:33.824
No.

23:36.705 --> 23:40.704
I've got something
that belongs to you.

23:43.385 --> 23:47.384
I thought I'd lost it.

23:55.185 --> 23:57.424
You told me I was beautiful today.

23:57.425 --> 23:59.144
I know.

23:59.145 --> 24:01.584
Everything that happens to Simon,

24:01.585 --> 24:04.424
it's already happened to me.

24:04.425 --> 24:07.384
You made me feel...

24:07.385 --> 24:09.744
Ever since I got this power,

24:09.745 --> 24:12.824
blokes, you know...

24:12.825 --> 24:15.424
It doesn't make you feel
very good about yourself.

24:15.425 --> 24:18.664
It's not down to you.

24:18.665 --> 24:20.824
None of us asked for this.

24:20.825 --> 24:23.104
What d'you want from me?

24:23.105 --> 24:27.104
Why are you here in this time?

24:27.705 --> 24:31.664
I came back for you.

24:31.665 --> 24:33.904
Are we together?

24:33.905 --> 24:37.304
We will be.

24:37.305 --> 24:39.664
That's why I'm here.

24:39.665 --> 24:41.104
You and me?

24:41.105 --> 24:44.624
Seriously.

24:44.625 --> 24:48.624
How is that ever gonna happen?

24:50.905 --> 24:54.904
You fall in love with me.

24:55.505 --> 24:58.144
You can't say stuff like that.

24:58.145 --> 24:59.944
You know what happens.

24:59.945 --> 25:03.944
And I don't know how I'm supposed
to feel, and it's freaking me out.

25:10.105 --> 25:14.104
You... You need to go.

25:14.945 --> 25:17.544
Don't.

25:17.545 --> 25:21.544
Will you please fuck off!

26:08.705 --> 26:10.984
Hi.

26:10.985 --> 26:14.984
Come here.

26:18.105 --> 26:18.704
I don't feel like it.

26:18.705 --> 26:21.824
C'mon.
Let's go to the storeroom.

26:21.825 --> 26:24.744
Can we just leave it, yeah?

26:24.745 --> 26:26.224
What's up with you?

26:26.225 --> 26:28.064
Nothing.

26:28.065 --> 26:29.264
No, no, you've been in
some kind of weird mood.

26:29.265 --> 26:30.304
No, I haven't.

26:30.305 --> 26:32.944
Now you don't want to have sex?

26:32.945 --> 26:36.704
We don't have sex.
What's that supposed to mean?

26:36.705 --> 26:37.864
Well? What?

26:37.865 --> 26:41.504
Is this it? Is this the best I get?
Wanking myself off in a storeroom.

26:41.505 --> 26:43.624
It's not my fault I can't touch you.

26:43.625 --> 26:45.584
So it's my fault?

26:45.585 --> 26:46.944
No, I didn't mean that.

26:46.945 --> 26:48.664
You think I've asked for this?
No.

26:48.665 --> 26:51.184
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I deserve all this.

26:51.185 --> 26:54.864
But I need
you to make me feel like I don't.

26:54.865 --> 26:57.824
Alisha, I didn't mean that.

26:57.825 --> 26:59.104
Alisha.

26:59.105 --> 27:01.504
And don't even think about
using your power to fix this.

27:01.505 --> 27:05.504
I want to know what
a prick you can be.

27:06.425 --> 27:08.664
I don't even remember
having that done.

27:08.665 --> 27:12.664
No, neither do I. I don't regret
it though. Not one little bit.

27:13.745 --> 27:16.024
I think the tattoos
are controlling you.

27:16.025 --> 27:17.864
That tattoo guy must have done them.

27:17.865 --> 27:20.544
Er, Vince wouldn't do that.
He loves me.

27:20.545 --> 27:23.664
That's your tattoo talking.
Cute and clever.

27:23.665 --> 27:27.664
And that's yours.

27:44.545 --> 27:48.544
Hi.

27:50.665 --> 27:54.664
Are you coming in?

27:56.025 --> 27:59.504
I don't even know if what
you're telling me is true.

27:59.505 --> 28:03.224
You say all these, things.

28:03.225 --> 28:05.904
You tell me I fall in love with you.

28:05.905 --> 28:08.624
How do I know it happens?

28:08.625 --> 28:12.624
You can't do this to me.

28:51.945 --> 28:54.984
I have to go.

28:54.985 --> 28:58.984
You touch me like that and
then you tell me you have to go?

28:59.745 --> 29:02.824
There's something I need to do.

29:02.825 --> 29:06.824
Wait here.

29:10.705 --> 29:14.624
What am I doing?

29:14.625 --> 29:17.144
It's going to be all right.

29:17.145 --> 29:21.144
I should know. I'm from the future.

29:32.585 --> 29:33.624
We need to get him
to remove the tattoos.

29:33.625 --> 29:34.904
I really don't think he did it.

29:34.905 --> 29:37.424
I need to find Alisha.
We had a big fight.

29:37.425 --> 29:41.424
Hey, man. Love hurts, OK.
It chews you up and spits you out...

29:41.745 --> 29:44.624
like a big ball of mucus.

29:44.625 --> 29:48.624
Oy.

29:49.065 --> 29:50.184
It's him.

29:50.185 --> 29:51.824
We can see that.

29:51.825 --> 29:55.824
What does he want?

29:56.585 --> 29:58.304
Hi.

29:58.305 --> 30:01.344
You all right there, fella?

30:01.345 --> 30:05.344
He's got a gun!

30:21.465 --> 30:23.544
It's peanuts.

30:23.545 --> 30:25.104
Dry-roasted.

30:25.105 --> 30:27.704
All that drama, he drops off a snack?

30:27.705 --> 30:30.944
Why is he giving us peanuts?

30:30.945 --> 30:34.464
Maybe he knows I missed lunch.

30:34.465 --> 30:37.544
I suppose you've got a
better explanation than that?

30:37.545 --> 30:38.584
Anything,

30:38.585 --> 30:40.584
anything you could possibly come
up with would be better than that.

30:40.585 --> 30:43.264
All right, touchy. Just cos you
and your girlfriend split up.

30:43.265 --> 30:45.904
We didn't split up!

30:45.905 --> 30:49.904
All right.

30:52.505 --> 30:54.664
We should go to the tattoo parlour.

30:54.665 --> 30:55.944
Are you coming?

30:55.945 --> 30:59.944
Let's just get this done, all right?

31:15.985 --> 31:19.984
Oh, there he is, Mr Dick.

31:20.665 --> 31:23.504
Because of the tattoo, on your cock?

31:23.505 --> 31:25.184
So what is this?

31:25.185 --> 31:28.344
We know about the tattoos.
I told them that you didn't do it.

31:28.345 --> 31:32.064
Just get rid of the
bullshit tattoos, yeah?

31:32.065 --> 31:33.504
Or what?

31:33.505 --> 31:34.784
Or get ready to feel the pain.

31:34.785 --> 31:35.904
You're not gonna hurt him.

31:35.905 --> 31:38.224
You're on our side.

31:38.225 --> 31:41.944
He's so fit.
Lose the tattoos!

31:41.945 --> 31:45.944
WHIRRING

31:53.025 --> 31:55.664
You stabbed me!

31:55.665 --> 31:58.544
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.
She stays. You go.

31:58.545 --> 31:59.624
Don't just stand there.

31:59.625 --> 32:02.864
Right, right, right.

32:02.865 --> 32:06.864
What do we do?

32:10.425 --> 32:14.424
Remove the tattoos,
or I open the nuts.

32:16.065 --> 32:18.664
He stabs me
and you're offering him peanuts?

32:18.665 --> 32:21.824
Nuts are his kryptonite.

32:21.825 --> 32:22.984
Like in Superman.

32:22.985 --> 32:26.984
Listen.
Sure we can work this out, yeah?

32:27.905 --> 32:30.744
Don't open those nuts.

32:30.745 --> 32:32.464
You want some?

32:32.465 --> 32:34.184
Dry roasted.

32:34.185 --> 32:35.824
So butch.

32:35.825 --> 32:39.824
Listen! Drop the nuts
or I'll take her eye out!

32:42.145 --> 32:44.904
You're so sexy.

32:44.905 --> 32:47.624
Let her go!
Put your nuts on the floor!

32:47.625 --> 32:49.544
Don't make me do it!
Drop the nuts!

32:49.545 --> 32:51.904
Drop the gun!
Will someone tell me what's going on!

32:51.905 --> 32:53.824
I will shoot her in the eye!

32:53.825 --> 32:55.664
Let her go!

32:55.665 --> 32:59.664
AAARGHHHHH!

33:19.065 --> 33:22.024
Simon!

33:22.025 --> 33:26.024
Please don't kill him.
My beautiful boy.

33:27.265 --> 33:31.264
I will never...let you go...

33:49.785 --> 33:51.184
Remove...the...tattoos.

33:51.185 --> 33:53.704
Inject me.

33:53.705 --> 33:57.704
Do it!

34:19.625 --> 34:23.623
If you want to spunk all over a
girl's tattoos, just ask them, yeah?

34:32.643 --> 34:35.402
What do you want?

34:35.402 --> 34:39.402
I bought you some pyjamas.

35:08.803 --> 35:11.682
Are you OK?

35:11.683 --> 35:14.642
Brilliant

35:14.643 --> 35:18.642
Peaches and cream

35:20.883 --> 35:23.922
Can I do anything, like?

35:23.923 --> 35:25.602
You got a spare heart?

35:25.603 --> 35:29.602
What?

35:31.483 --> 35:32.922
I just erm...

35:32.923 --> 35:34.762
I just wanted you to have 'em.

35:34.763 --> 35:38.442
You know?

35:38.443 --> 35:42.442
I hope they fit all right.

35:43.763 --> 35:47.762
Thanks.

35:49.843 --> 35:53.042
I have to go, like.

35:53.043 --> 35:56.482
I feel weird leaving you like this.

35:56.483 --> 36:00.482
It's not as bad it looks.

36:01.723 --> 36:05.722
I'll be fine.

36:13.963 --> 36:16.482
This is where it all started.

36:16.483 --> 36:19.682
I'm standing in the exact spot
where three months ago

36:19.683 --> 36:22.482
a freak storm caused The ASBO Five

36:22.483 --> 36:26.002
to develop
their extraordinary powers.

36:26.003 --> 36:29.522
So when did you first realise
you had a power?

36:29.523 --> 36:33.042
'Well, we'd just found that other
boy's body stuffed in the locker

36:33.043 --> 36:35.762
'and then Curtis grabbed my hand
and he's all like,

36:35.763 --> 36:38.322
"Oh, I want to bone you.
I want to shag you senseless."

36:38.323 --> 36:42.122
I mean, I guess I didn't really know
for sure until I touched Simon.

36:42.123 --> 36:46.122
LIFT OPENS

36:51.203 --> 36:54.442
You shouldn't be watching that.

36:54.443 --> 36:58.002
Do we become famous?

36:58.003 --> 36:59.962
Do you want to be famous?

36:59.963 --> 37:03.962
It's got to be better
than picking up litter.

37:11.203 --> 37:15.202
Sometimes I think
that was the best time of my life.

37:15.403 --> 37:19.402
Does something bad happen to us?

37:19.723 --> 37:23.722
Am I going to die?

37:24.123 --> 37:28.122
I'm not going to let that happen.

37:28.403 --> 37:32.402
So what happens now?

37:33.963 --> 37:37.762
What do you want to happen?

37:37.763 --> 37:41.762
I don't know.

38:29.483 --> 38:33.482
# So I walked into the haze

38:36.723 --> 38:40.722
# And a million dirty ways

38:45.403 --> 38:49.402
# Now I see you lying there

38:53.643 --> 38:57.642
# Like a lilo losing air

39:01.603 --> 39:05.602
# Black rocks and shoreline sand

39:09.843 --> 39:13.842
# Still that summer I cannot bear

39:17.523 --> 39:21.522
# And I wipe the sand from my eyes

39:25.563 --> 39:27.562
# The Spanish Sahara

39:27.563 --> 39:29.442
# The place that you wanna

39:29.443 --> 39:33.082
# Leave the horror here

39:33.083 --> 39:36.202
# Forget the horror, yeah

39:36.203 --> 39:37.962
# Forget the horror... #

39:37.963 --> 39:41.242
Don't take this
the wrong way, but...

39:41.243 --> 39:45.242
You're way better
than I thought you'd be.

39:45.603 --> 39:49.602
I had a good teacher.

39:49.763 --> 39:51.162
You.

39:51.163 --> 39:54.562
I never taught you how to do that.

39:54.563 --> 39:56.522
Not yet.

39:56.523 --> 40:00.442
But you will.

40:00.443 --> 40:04.322
I didn't realise
how much I missed it.

40:04.323 --> 40:08.322
Being able to touch someone.

40:08.603 --> 40:12.602
I can't believe
I've just had sex with you.

40:14.523 --> 40:16.282
You're Simon.

40:16.283 --> 40:20.122
You're still a virgin.

40:20.123 --> 40:24.122
Not for much longer.

40:25.443 --> 40:29.442
Do you lose it with me?

40:35.723 --> 40:38.522
Are you jealous?

40:38.523 --> 40:41.602
Shut up.

40:41.603 --> 40:45.402
I like it that you're jealous.

40:45.403 --> 40:49.402
This is too weird.

40:55.843 --> 40:58.002
So that was
an unexpected turn of events.

40:58.003 --> 41:00.322
You mean you being a big gay?

41:00.323 --> 41:03.082
I'm not a gay. Look at me.

41:03.083 --> 41:06.282
You sure about that?

41:06.283 --> 41:09.842
I'm about 98% certain.
Would you like me to prove it to you?

41:09.843 --> 41:11.562
Go on then.

41:11.563 --> 41:14.842
Really?

41:14.843 --> 41:17.842
Get on with it.

41:17.843 --> 41:20.242
All right.

41:20.243 --> 41:21.522
Prepare to be aroused.

41:21.523 --> 41:25.522
Oh, just kiss me, you dick!

41:40.923 --> 41:44.922
Yeah... Undo this...

42:03.003 --> 42:06.282
I'm not being funny, yeah, but,
is this doing anything for you?

42:06.283 --> 42:09.202
Well, you know I'm a guy.
We're really not that fussy.

42:09.203 --> 42:10.802
It just feels all wrong,

42:10.803 --> 42:13.322
like I'm doing it
with my cousin or something.

42:13.323 --> 42:17.322
Well, I could slip another finger
up there. You know, go two up?

42:18.043 --> 42:19.682
No, it just don't feel right.

42:19.683 --> 42:23.682
You know when you just know?

42:24.643 --> 42:28.282
I just think we should be mates.

42:28.283 --> 42:31.122
After all these weeks' build-up
we're not even going to shag?

42:31.123 --> 42:32.442
Is that what you're saying?

42:32.443 --> 42:33.842
Sorry.

42:33.843 --> 42:37.802
Yeah.

42:37.803 --> 42:41.282
You want to take that out?

42:41.283 --> 42:43.202
Oh, yeah, OK.

42:43.203 --> 42:46.442
Oh, I think it's stuck.

42:46.443 --> 42:46.842
Oh, for fuck's sake!

42:46.843 --> 42:50.842
Oh, for fuck's sake!
Hang on.

42:51.963 --> 42:55.962
Hello!

42:57.323 --> 42:59.362
Mates, yeah?

42:59.363 --> 43:03.362
Yeah, mates.

43:04.363 --> 43:05.922
Big buddies.

43:05.923 --> 43:09.922
Pals.

43:59.043 --> 44:00.642
Hi.

44:00.643 --> 44:04.482
I got to go do my Community Service.

44:04.483 --> 44:08.482
I guess you know that,
cos I'm going to see you there.

44:11.443 --> 44:14.802
So...

44:14.803 --> 44:18.802
Are we seeing each other now?

44:27.443 --> 44:28.962
Yes.

44:28.963 --> 44:31.802
I can't lie to Curtis.

44:31.803 --> 44:33.362
I can't do that to him.

44:33.363 --> 44:35.842
You have to.

44:35.843 --> 44:38.122
What, you want me
to keep on seeing him?

44:38.123 --> 44:42.122
The present me isn't ready
for what has to happen.

44:44.163 --> 44:46.962
You have to give me time.

44:46.963 --> 44:49.282
Will you stop being
so fucking mysterious!

44:49.283 --> 44:55.282
It goes with the territory.
Yeah, well it's annoying!

44:59.323 --> 45:01.802
You have to trust me.

45:01.803 --> 45:05.802
Just let it play out.

45:10.883 --> 45:13.562
What's up with you?

45:13.563 --> 45:15.722
I just realised
I haven't died this week.

45:15.723 --> 45:18.562
It's only Thursday.
There's still time.

45:18.563 --> 45:22.202
Now why would you say
something like that? Twat!

45:22.203 --> 45:25.802
So you don't love me any more?
OK. So I loved you. Big deal.

45:25.803 --> 45:28.162
I think we should talk about it.

45:28.163 --> 45:29.482
I so want to hear this.

45:29.483 --> 45:31.162
If we'd have...

45:31.163 --> 45:33.722
That would've been
the best sex you've ever had.

45:33.723 --> 45:37.002
Correction. That would've been
the only sex you've ever had.

45:37.003 --> 45:39.882
Do you ever get embarrassed
of anything? Not really, no.

45:39.883 --> 45:41.402
We done?

45:41.403 --> 45:43.962
You know that fella in the mask?

45:43.963 --> 45:46.482
How did he know
that Vince was allergic to nuts?

45:46.483 --> 45:49.082
I told you.
He seems to know everything.

45:49.083 --> 45:53.082
We need to find out who he is.

45:53.763 --> 45:57.762
Can't we just let him do his thing?
I mean seriously, who cares?

46:00.323 --> 46:04.322
That's a bald fanny!

46:06.163 --> 46:10.162
Oh, they love it!

46:10.563 --> 46:14.562
Bosh!

46:18.163 --> 46:21.762
He's going to be doing his Community
Service thing with you lot.

46:21.763 --> 46:23.962
Are you saying he's like
a new member of the gang?

46:23.963 --> 46:25.922
We can't let the new guy
find out about our powers.

46:25.923 --> 46:28.522
Have any of you
got one of these weird powers?

46:28.523 --> 46:29.842
Things with us...

46:29.843 --> 46:32.202
They haven't been right
for a while now.

46:32.203 --> 46:33.362
You're different.

46:33.363 --> 46:37.082
If you're done being
all super-heroey with your clocks,

46:37.083 --> 46:41.082
you can come back to bed.

46:41.283 --> 46:42.642
He's fucking crazy!

46:42.643 --> 46:45.162
Do you think he was talking
about this fella?

46:45.163 --> 46:46.762
I want my money.

46:46.763 --> 46:49.002
All we need is 100 grand.

46:49.003 --> 46:50.162
Let's rob a bank.

46:50.163 --> 46:53.562
This is not real. It's just a game!
You think this is a game?

46:53.563 --> 46:57.562
This is my life.
