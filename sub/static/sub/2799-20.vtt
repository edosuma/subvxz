00:51.969 --> 00:53.909
Feel like getting high?

00:53.976 --> 00:55.983
Do I have to?

00:57.321 --> 00:58.457
Hey, this is Stokes.

00:58.525 --> 01:01.910
I need a lift to
Convention Center Drive.

01:02.171 --> 01:04.947
Looks like somebody had some
late-night target practice.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.573
Three Boy Does.

01:07.640 --> 01:08.576
No IDs.

01:08.644 --> 01:11.218
Nobody saw anything.

01:11.674 --> 01:14.030
Nine-millimeter shells
all over the place.

01:14.086 --> 01:16.026
That's a lot of racket.
Somebody heard something.

01:16.061 --> 01:16.982
Only ones who did

01:17.017 --> 01:19.238
thought it was the
fireworks show at the Wynn.

01:19.273 --> 01:20.985
Good luck.

01:33.328 --> 01:34.767
What do you think?

01:34.834 --> 01:38.148
Time of death: 3:17 A.M.?

01:38.184 --> 01:40.687
Shot through a Flavor Flav clock.

01:40.754 --> 01:42.292
Haven't seen one of
these since high school.

01:42.359 --> 01:44.266
Old school's the new school.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.774
So, what do you think?

01:59.809 --> 02:01.592
This has got to be a gang war, huh?

02:02.076 --> 02:04.068
Well, if it's a gang war...

02:04.135 --> 02:06.635
these kids were outgunned.

02:43.336 --> 02:45.000
No personal effects!

02:45.035 --> 02:46.724
No keys, no ID!

02:46.759 --> 02:48.288
Nothing!

02:48.354 --> 02:49.828
Either these kids were traveling light,

02:49.863 --> 02:51.337
or they were robbed blind.

02:51.372 --> 02:54.158
And who the hell would rob
them up there? Andre the Giant?

02:58.222 --> 03:02.202
Hey, Doc, is it just me, or
did something crush his legs?

03:02.269 --> 03:05.380
Well, first off...

03:07.421 --> 03:09.866
...looks like he is a she,

03:09.901 --> 03:12.537
and something crushed her legs.

03:20.298 --> 03:22.103
What do you think this is?

03:22.171 --> 03:23.977
That's your job.

03:24.044 --> 03:26.117
Yeah.

03:26.717 --> 03:32.238
Well... I did find casings
in such a wide distribution...

03:32.306 --> 03:34.073
and a lot of them were flattened,

03:34.108 --> 03:36.536
so it suggests to me
that the killer was moving

03:36.571 --> 03:37.678
when he was shooting.

03:42.174 --> 03:43.126
Drive-by?

03:43.161 --> 03:45.393
Yeah, with a
hit-and-run chaser.

03:54.111 --> 03:55.436
What up, country?

03:55.472 --> 03:58.004
So, the bullet is practically smooth.

03:58.039 --> 04:00.537
I mean, no sharp-edged rifling marks.

04:00.603 --> 04:02.948
Which means it was probably
fired from a polygonal barrel.

04:02.983 --> 04:04.194
Did you run cartridge casings yet?

04:04.229 --> 04:07.554
Yeah, yeah, and got an IBIS hit
off of a firing pin impression.

04:07.589 --> 04:11.207
Murder weapon is an H&K MP-5.

04:11.273 --> 04:13.331
That's a $2,500 firearm.

04:13.366 --> 04:15.010
That's not your typical street piece.

04:15.045 --> 04:16.899
Yeah. It registered to LVPD.

04:16.935 --> 04:17.469
Really?

04:17.505 --> 04:17.969
Yeah.

04:18.004 --> 04:20.154
Those babies are very
popular with law enforcement,

04:20.190 --> 04:21.947
and that one

04:21.982 --> 04:24.356
is issued to SWAT...

04:24.357 --> 04:26.959
and reported stolen during a drug raid

04:26.994 --> 04:29.692
on Vegas Valley and Sandhill...

04:29.727 --> 04:32.411
six months ago

05:05.571 --> 05:09.115
Hodges, you getting anywhere
with that steel rod we found?

05:09.586 --> 05:12.263
Your steel rod is part of
a custom hydraulic cylinder.

05:12.298 --> 05:15.375
Size and shape is a match
for a brand called "Red's".

05:15.410 --> 05:17.209
Oh, this guy was
driving a street hopper.

05:17.244 --> 05:19.654
Low-riders get little clearance...

05:21.735 --> 05:24.542
I'm sure he was more busted
up about his ride being damaged

05:24.577 --> 05:26.332
than the three kids he whacked.

05:27.121 --> 05:28.103
Also found

05:28.138 --> 05:30.647
paint traces on the rod.

05:30.714 --> 05:34.419
Color is Chesapeake Blue Pearl.

05:34.454 --> 05:36.445
It's from a Dupont line
called "Brilliantz".

05:36.480 --> 05:38.977
Mostly used on show vehicles.

05:39.043 --> 05:41.050
Red's auto parts are
individually serialized.

05:41.117 --> 05:43.559
Shouldn't be too hard to
find out where it was sold.

05:43.626 --> 05:44.103
Cool.

05:44.138 --> 05:45.806
A'ight, G, so...

05:46.045 --> 05:47.725
Don't make me shoot you.

05:48.643 --> 05:50.716
Crime Scene Investigation.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.590
Hell, I love a bloody scene...

05:52.657 --> 05:54.597
DNA and all that.

05:54.664 --> 05:56.210
Look, you give me a serial number,

05:56.245 --> 05:57.720
I can definitely figure
out who bought it.

05:57.755 --> 05:59.469
Yeah, yeah, here you go.

05:59.504 --> 06:00.893
A'ight.

06:02.825 --> 06:04.589
This is the old style cylinder.

06:05.802 --> 06:06.998
Give me a second.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.941
Yeah, man, this, uh...
serial's not showing up.

06:17.976 --> 06:19.091
You said "definitely".

06:19.126 --> 06:20.697
Yeah, but these old serial numbers

06:20.732 --> 06:22.268
sometimes get erased from the system.

06:22.303 --> 06:23.454
I mean, it's happened, you know?

06:23.490 --> 06:25.602
Sounds like the wrong name
might've just popped up.

06:25.637 --> 06:27.029
No name popped up.

06:27.064 --> 06:27.956
What's the matter, man?

06:27.991 --> 06:29.890
You worried about having
some hard times if you give

06:29.925 --> 06:30.882
your homey's name up?

06:30.917 --> 06:33.117
I'll get a warrant. You don't
mind taking a break for a while,

06:33.152 --> 06:35.230
sitting on the curb while
we get some cops up in here.

06:35.265 --> 06:37.309
Look, man, I don't need that
kind of a scene around here.

06:37.460 --> 06:38.944
How 'bout we do this?

06:38.979 --> 06:41.268
How 'bout you let us muscle
you off your computer,

06:41.303 --> 06:42.773
and we can get the
information ourselves?

06:42.808 --> 06:44.208
That way, if you're ever asked,

06:44.243 --> 06:45.726
you can say there was
nothing you could do.

06:45.761 --> 06:48.640
You can let us do our jobs,
and we'll be out of your hair.

06:52.498 --> 06:53.994
I can live with that.

06:55.340 --> 06:56.677
Good man.

07:03.735 --> 07:08.234
Jeremiah Calvin. 59391 Sandhill.

07:09.087 --> 07:12.654
That's the same part of town
where the SWAT cop lost his gun.

07:17.650 --> 07:21.130
How long ago did I call for backup?

07:21.196 --> 07:23.905
About 15 minutes.

07:26.915 --> 07:30.912
Dispatch, this is unit 3D7.

07:30.947 --> 07:34.910
We are 465 at 59391 Sandhill.

07:34.976 --> 07:36.090
ETA on that backup?

07:36.125 --> 07:37.170
<i>Unit 3D7, copy.</i>

07:37.205 --> 07:39.857
<i>ETA approximately five minutes.</i>

07:40.417 --> 07:42.307
Copy that. We'll sit tight.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.370
Hello. There's our
gangster ride right there.

07:45.405 --> 07:46.693
With a gangster in it.

07:46.728 --> 07:47.697
Yep.

07:48.959 --> 07:51.367
Look at that.

07:56.519 --> 07:57.149
He saw us.

07:57.184 --> 08:00.163
If we don't get him now,
man, we're losing him forever.

08:00.553 --> 08:01.940
Then go for it.

08:02.573 --> 08:04.683
Dispatch, this is unit 3D7.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.759
Suspect is on the move.

08:06.794 --> 08:09.889
It's a, uh, royal blue Chevy Impala

08:09.924 --> 08:13.306
northbound on Vegas Valley Drive.

08:13.341 --> 08:16.688
License
4-2-3-Nora-Queen-John.

08:16.755 --> 08:17.758
Northbound.

08:17.824 --> 08:18.695
<i>Copy that.</i>

08:18.761 --> 08:20.568
<i>I'll inform the backup.</i>

08:21.401 --> 08:23.017
Where are we now?

08:23.478 --> 08:27.024
Dispatch, westbound Hatteras.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.398
Westbound Hatteras.

08:29.399 --> 08:33.592
Suspect is now west on Kreg Avenue.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.631
We're now southbound on Eastern.

08:47.326 --> 08:49.300
Dispatch, uh, this is unit 3D7.

08:49.366 --> 08:51.541
Suspect has pulled into an alley

08:51.608 --> 08:53.128
on the 7700 block on Eastern.

08:53.163 --> 08:54.218
Where's my backup?

08:55.210 --> 08:56.386
<i>We've got two on the way.</i>

08:56.421 --> 08:58.859
<i>They're stuck behind a
TC on Maryland Parkway.</i>

08:59.469 --> 09:00.444
Hey, what are you doing?

09:00.480 --> 09:02.227
I told you little punk... airport cops

09:02.262 --> 09:03.409
to stop riding me, man.

09:03.444 --> 09:04.557
Son, get back in the car.

09:04.592 --> 09:05.472
You get out the car!

09:05.507 --> 09:07.455
All this old Crime Scene
stuff followin' me, man.

09:07.490 --> 09:09.402
Y'all think you're all
cops? Y'all ain't cops.

09:09.470 --> 09:10.707
That's right, we're not cops.

09:10.774 --> 09:11.778
We're mad scientists.

09:11.845 --> 09:13.049
Back away from the vehicle

09:13.116 --> 09:14.244
and let me see your hands right now.

09:14.279 --> 09:16.359
Dispatch, we got a code three.

09:16.427 --> 09:17.530
Hey, hold on, man,
you calling for backup?

09:17.598 --> 09:19.310
Your backup or my backup?

09:20.541 --> 09:22.667
Son, you trying to win
the wet tee shirt contest?

09:22.702 --> 09:24.317
My partner here's a great shot.

09:24.352 --> 09:25.893
Yeah, you're real cute
with that gun, too.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.061
I'm not going to tell you again.

09:27.096 --> 09:28.633
You know what, man? I've
had so many damn guns

09:28.668 --> 09:30.877
pointed at my face, I feel
right at home looking at yours.

09:30.944 --> 09:32.047
Let me see your hands.

09:32.115 --> 09:33.620
How you know I won't shoot your man?

09:33.686 --> 09:35.593
Huh? How you know I ain't
got something at my waist

09:35.660 --> 09:36.731
pointed at your man right now?

09:36.797 --> 09:38.236
You know, hollow points'll go

09:38.303 --> 09:39.841
right through the door.

09:43.956 --> 09:45.460
You want to shoot me, huh?

09:47.501 --> 09:48.437
Whoa, whoa, hey, right here.

09:48.504 --> 09:49.574
He was reaching for something.

09:49.641 --> 09:51.682
Check him for weapons, Mitch.

09:54.600 --> 09:55.329
It's cool. He's clean.

09:55.395 --> 09:56.298
He's clean?

09:56.365 --> 09:57.669
I don't need no gun for you!

09:58.707 --> 09:59.710
Just be cool.

09:59.776 --> 10:01.048
You messed with the wrong brother.

10:01.115 --> 10:04.125
Whatever, man. Just
be cool, just be cool.

10:04.881 --> 10:07.312
I'm telling you, man, I'm ready
to file a complaint right now.

10:07.824 --> 10:10.562
And that not-a-cop better be
lucky I ain't suing his ass.

10:10.598 --> 10:11.671
<i>Maybe I will.</i>

10:11.738 --> 10:13.678
<i>Look, man, I wasn't even doing nothing.</i>

10:14.888 --> 10:15.860
Hey.

10:15.925 --> 10:17.163
How'd things go with Ecklie?

10:17.791 --> 10:18.602
Not good.

10:20.534 --> 10:22.882
Don't worry. I'll go and talk to him.

10:22.917 --> 10:24.669
No, don't talk to him.

10:25.274 --> 10:27.165
<i>You want to tell me
what your car was doing</i>

10:27.231 --> 10:30.376
at the scene of a triple
homicide two nights ago?

10:31.013 --> 10:32.048
Wait, hold up, h
- hold up, man.

10:32.115 --> 10:33.051
Let's get this straight.

10:33.864 --> 10:35.226
I don't own a car.

10:35.594 --> 10:36.898
You can check the papers.

10:36.966 --> 10:38.203
That's my Grandpa's ride.

10:38.269 --> 10:39.808
So you borrowed it two nights ago?

10:39.876 --> 10:41.046
No, I didn't.

10:41.113 --> 10:42.651
I was working, man.

10:42.718 --> 10:44.591
I deejay over at O.G.

10:44.658 --> 10:46.265
If you don't believe me, you could ask

10:46.330 --> 10:49.910
Jeni, and Rocker Jules, and GG,

10:49.977 --> 10:52.921
and Lina, and Blaze.

10:53.087 --> 10:54.860
You know, I had my first
five-some that night.

10:54.928 --> 10:57.135
And there wasn't no
homicides goin' down.

10:57.201 --> 10:59.042
You could believe that.

10:59.108 --> 11:01.583
I'm happy for you, man.

11:01.650 --> 11:04.260
So, what, are you pinning
this rap on Grandpa?

11:04.327 --> 11:07.203
Yo, man, my grandpa was a
gangster back in the day.

11:07.270 --> 11:08.708
You'd be surprised.

11:08.774 --> 11:11.384
Yeah, I'm really not
surprised by much anymore.

11:11.452 --> 11:14.060
We have a warrant to
search your house...

11:14.127 --> 11:16.902
and I bet I find a crime
to go with every gun.

11:17.793 --> 11:20.615
If I'd killed those kids...

11:21.098 --> 11:23.292
you would never find a gun.

11:29.546 --> 11:30.851
Las Vegas Police.

11:30.918 --> 11:32.858
We have a warrant to
search the premises.

11:32.925 --> 11:35.333
Come on in.

11:43.428 --> 11:45.368
Costs money to fix a door.

11:45.435 --> 11:46.773
Thanks for knocking.

11:52.313 --> 11:53.713
Clear.

11:54.154 --> 11:55.664
Got any guns in the house, sir?

11:55.699 --> 11:57.176
I don't allow that garbage in here.

11:57.243 --> 11:58.500
Where's Jeremiah's room?

11:58.535 --> 11:59.985
End of the hall.

12:04.568 --> 12:06.407
Got nothing.

12:12.093 --> 12:13.899
I'm going to need you
to verify the whereabouts

12:13.966 --> 12:15.338
of your grandson
Jeremiah two nights ago.

12:15.405 --> 12:16.742
How the hell would I know?

12:16.809 --> 12:18.081
Man, you're making me miss my program.

12:18.148 --> 12:19.752
It's not like I got that TiVo.

12:19.820 --> 12:21.058
Mr. Calvin?

12:21.124 --> 12:22.630
Whose room is next to Jeremiah's?

12:22.698 --> 12:23.598
Morris'.

12:23.633 --> 12:24.809
Did Morris ever drive the car?

12:24.844 --> 12:25.522
Go ask him.

12:25.558 --> 12:26.166
Where is he?

12:26.201 --> 12:29.152
He wasn't in his room?
He's been in there all day.

12:29.219 --> 12:30.958
Morris?

12:32.999 --> 12:35.006
Morris?

12:43.067 --> 12:44.879
Control, this is CSI Willows.

12:44.914 --> 12:45.969
We need an ambulance.

12:46.004 --> 12:46.848
<i>Copy that.</i>

12:47.014 --> 12:49.356
Hey, Morris, somebody's coming for you.

12:52.802 --> 12:56.581
He doesn't have a bad attitude,
he has Clostridium tetani.

12:56.648 --> 12:58.086
Tetanus.

12:58.152 --> 13:01.631
I extracted this from
the wound in his calf.

13:03.538 --> 13:05.411
Bacteria on the stable
got into the bloodstream

13:05.478 --> 13:08.287
releasing toxins that
enabled muscular contractions.

13:08.354 --> 13:10.218
That's why they call it lockjaw.

13:11.465 --> 13:13.271
No wonder he wouldn't talk
- he couldn't.

13:13.940 --> 13:15.311
How long before he can?

13:15.379 --> 13:17.017
Take couple of days for the antibiotics

13:17.084 --> 13:19.571
to flush it out of his system.

13:22.771 --> 13:24.612
Well, he doesn't have lock-wrist.

13:24.648 --> 13:25.346
You got a pen?

13:31.512 --> 13:34.216
We match your blood to the staple gun,

13:34.251 --> 13:36.920
it puts you at Convention Center Drive

13:36.986 --> 13:38.224
and you go down for three murders.

13:39.429 --> 13:42.271
You have anything to tell us,

13:42.339 --> 13:44.311
now's the time.

15:16.965 --> 15:20.678
Hey, so the car was
definitely at the scene.

15:20.744 --> 15:25.661
Blood on the soft-top was
a match to one of the vics.

15:25.729 --> 15:27.100
And Morris Calvin was there.

15:27.167 --> 15:29.874
DNA confirmed that it was
his blood on the staple gun.

15:42.287 --> 15:43.925
Yeah, but we don't have a murder weapon

15:43.992 --> 15:45.872
so we can't confirm
Morris was the shooter.

15:45.907 --> 15:47.753
There's a ton of unknown
prints on the car.

15:47.788 --> 15:49.779
GSR in the backseat.

15:49.845 --> 15:51.116
Had to be other people involved.

15:51.183 --> 15:52.855
If we could ID the vics,

15:52.922 --> 15:54.494
it might tell us who'd want them dead.

15:54.817 --> 15:57.271
Standard procedure for a drive-by

15:57.339 --> 16:00.349
is shoot as much as you can
as fast as you can, right?

16:00.415 --> 16:01.886
Then leave as fast as you can.

16:02.412 --> 16:05.232
So why did Morris get out of the car?

16:05.299 --> 16:07.071
Maybe the vics had something he wanted.

16:07.138 --> 16:08.509
The only thing the
victims on the ground had

16:08.576 --> 16:10.751
on them were the clothes on their back.

16:10.817 --> 16:13.427
And the kid in the palm
tree, empty satchel.

16:13.494 --> 16:16.370
Vega ran the vics' past
the guys in the Gang Unit.

16:16.930 --> 16:18.779
Nobody recognized them.

16:18.845 --> 16:21.054
And tox panels on them
all came back negative.

16:21.120 --> 16:22.591
There were no drugs in their system,

16:22.658 --> 16:24.097
no personal effects.

16:24.164 --> 16:26.037
I doubt they were even packing.

16:26.104 --> 16:27.675
They were packing posters.

16:27.743 --> 16:30.786
Are you suggesting that they
were killed for their posters?

16:31.780 --> 16:33.696
Maybe for what was on them.

16:34.731 --> 16:35.537
All right, now wait a minute,

16:35.603 --> 16:37.643
Grissom, there were posters
all over that street.

16:37.710 --> 16:40.186
Man, we have no way of knowing
which posters they put up.

16:40.253 --> 16:42.192
Well, you got the staple gun.

16:42.260 --> 16:44.049
Figure out what they stapled.

18:13.601 --> 18:14.979
Hey, Slick.

18:15.698 --> 18:19.428
I saw my P.O. yesterday,
guys, so you can just go home.

18:19.495 --> 18:21.402
Parole officer didn't
bring us here, cousin.

18:21.469 --> 18:22.673
A poster did.

18:22.740 --> 18:24.747
If you're trying to stick me

18:24.814 --> 18:26.249
with some kind of child porno thing

18:26.284 --> 18:27.858
or something sick like that,

18:27.925 --> 18:29.128
I'm not your guy.

18:29.195 --> 18:31.202
I do mainly concerts and conventions

18:31.269 --> 18:33.343
and have for the past 20 years.

18:33.409 --> 18:35.383
I'm cheap, fast, and open 24/7.

18:35.852 --> 18:38.093
Just like my ex-wife.

18:38.159 --> 18:40.166
You have any idea where this came from?

18:42.575 --> 18:45.418
You know, maybe.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.729
The wall of fame.

18:48.797 --> 18:52.643
This is where my customers
can appreciate my work.

18:52.977 --> 18:54.598
Let's see here.

18:54.633 --> 18:57.928
Yeah, now this is a classic.

18:57.995 --> 19:00.269
Now I know about "Chicks Gone Nutz"

19:00.336 --> 19:01.574
because of their booby videos

19:01.641 --> 19:04.852
but "Dudes Gone Nutz" now...

19:04.919 --> 19:06.357
that really busts my belt.

19:06.423 --> 19:08.063
You know, wait a second...

19:08.129 --> 19:09.869
I think I've seen that guy before.

19:09.937 --> 19:11.108
It's Dollar. He's a rapper.

19:11.173 --> 19:12.176
No kidding.

19:12.244 --> 19:13.850
Those dudes are nuts.

19:13.916 --> 19:16.860
Yeah, well, everybody goes nuts.

19:16.927 --> 19:18.700
Any idea who ordered up the poster?

19:18.767 --> 19:21.275
Skinny little black kid,
day before yesterday.

19:23.008 --> 19:24.417
One of these?

19:25.188 --> 19:27.965
Oh...

19:28.032 --> 19:29.170
Man. That's too bad.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.177
Yeah, there he is.

19:31.242 --> 19:32.480
How did he pay?

19:32.548 --> 19:33.952
Wad of cash.

19:34.831 --> 19:36.427
Interframe artifacts.

19:36.494 --> 19:39.840
It's a still frame from a video.

19:39.906 --> 19:41.947
I'm afraid we're going to
deplete your wall of fame-

19:42.013 --> 19:45.032
that posters coming with us.

19:47.934 --> 19:49.640
I did a search on Dollar.

19:49.707 --> 19:51.278
His real name is Jessie Cleveland.

19:51.346 --> 19:54.791
Vegas street kid made good,
first CD went platinum.

19:54.858 --> 19:56.899
Brass is contacting his managers.

19:56.965 --> 19:58.638
Here he is.

19:59.928 --> 20:02.417
I'm guessing this is
not his next album cover.

20:02.977 --> 20:04.457
I doubt it.

20:05.781 --> 20:08.973
So when I went online, I
found the usual things...

20:09.041 --> 20:12.184
websites, photos, and this...

20:14.707 --> 20:16.532
<i>Playa, look, dawg, you
know what I'm saying,</i>

20:16.600 --> 20:18.505
<i>I got stacks of cash in the back, man,</i>

20:18.573 --> 20:22.018
<i>I got jewelry, I got Black
American Express cards.</i>

20:22.086 --> 20:23.825
<i>I got whatever you want,
man, take it all, dawg.</i>

20:23.892 --> 20:25.865
<i>Put your face in the
bed, your ass in the air,</i>

20:25.932 --> 20:29.076
<i>and say what I want you to say.</i>

20:31.415 --> 20:33.224
<i>I'm Dollar...</i>

20:33.291 --> 20:36.100
<i>from "Dudes Gone Nutz"</i>

20:37.021 --> 20:38.474
<i>and I liked it...</i>

20:41.652 --> 20:42.890
<i>I like to take it...</i>

20:42.958 --> 20:45.333
Video was mirrored on a dozen rap sites.

20:45.399 --> 20:46.870
It's all over the net.

20:46.937 --> 20:47.941
<i>This ain't right, dawg.</i>

20:48.008 --> 20:49.280
So this is a rap thing?

20:49.347 --> 20:51.152
Biggie and Tupac?

20:51.219 --> 20:52.724
<i>Who's the bitch now?</i>

20:52.791 --> 20:55.032
<i>You got it, dawg.</i>

20:55.100 --> 20:56.704
If these guys would shoot
somebody over lyrics,

20:56.771 --> 20:57.908
they'd definitely kill over this.

20:57.976 --> 20:59.882
Yeah.

21:02.540 --> 21:03.661
Mr. Dollar

21:03.728 --> 21:05.803
left strict instructions
not to be disturbed.

21:05.870 --> 21:07.030
Well, that's too bad
'cause we're conducing

21:07.065 --> 21:09.122
a murder investigation.

21:11.989 --> 21:13.511
Las Vegas Police.

21:13.546 --> 21:14.698
Open up.

21:17.489 --> 21:19.744
Would you open the door, please?

21:23.745 --> 21:24.468
Thank you.

21:39.017 --> 21:41.125
Hey, Jim, check it out.

21:41.192 --> 21:43.459
Hitting on 21.

21:43.494 --> 21:44.737
P-
I-M-P.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.309
Yeah. Don't kid yourself.

21:46.377 --> 21:47.948
He's getting pimped in that video.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.022
Excuse me, but if Mr. Dollar's not here,

21:50.088 --> 21:53.669
you're going to have to leave.

21:53.734 --> 21:55.575
We haven't even checked
under the bed yet.

21:55.725 --> 21:58.514
Yeah, and what's with
all the boxes, clothes?

21:58.673 --> 21:59.803
It's MAGIC.

21:59.803 --> 22:02.583
You know, for a concierge,
you're not really very helpful.

22:02.698 --> 22:03.807
It's a convention, sir.

22:03.854 --> 22:06.315
MAGIC
- Men's Apparel Guild In California.

22:06.469 --> 22:08.208
It's the largest fashion
show in the world.

22:08.432 --> 22:10.004
With every rapper,
there's a clothing line.

22:10.234 --> 22:11.147
They all come to MAGIC to promote it.

22:11.890 --> 22:13.161
Biggest party in town.

22:14.617 --> 22:16.656
So what kind of car did he drive?

22:17.384 --> 22:21.196
Um, sir, his vehicle's still in valet.

22:24.541 --> 22:26.352
There it is right there.

22:26.649 --> 22:28.355
Yeah, is that it?

22:28.422 --> 22:30.629
It's the only one with
22-inch rims; it's got to be.

22:35.178 --> 22:36.616
What's that?

22:36.683 --> 22:37.987
Open this up.

22:53.835 --> 22:55.213
Where we at, man?

22:55.281 --> 22:57.355
You're outside your hotel, sir.

22:57.422 --> 22:58.789
Don't worry, we're gonna
get you out of there

22:58.824 --> 23:00.688
and get you medical
attention. All right?

23:00.723 --> 23:02.518
Man, is you crazy? Look what I got on.

23:02.553 --> 23:05.824
I got all these people
around here, the press.

23:05.859 --> 23:09.095
Man, let me know when we
get to the hospital, man.

23:11.001 --> 23:12.808
He's got a point.

23:12.809 --> 23:14.638
My prints.

23:14.866 --> 23:16.636
They'all want my prints, folks.

23:17.023 --> 23:19.932
I'm the guy that was forced
to wear the bikini, remember?

23:19.999 --> 23:22.206
I was in a trunk. I was in two trunks.

23:22.274 --> 23:24.649
Three teenagers were killed
on Convention Center Drive.

23:24.716 --> 23:26.522
They were shot down
putting up posters of you.

23:26.589 --> 23:29.231
Man, there's posters
of me all over town.

23:29.298 --> 23:30.469
Got a record coming out.

23:30.536 --> 23:32.644
I know. I like the album cover.

23:35.058 --> 23:36.155
Where'd you get that?

23:36.222 --> 23:38.964
Like you said, they're all over town.

23:39.032 --> 23:42.075
We need your prints so that we
may exclude you as a suspect.

23:42.142 --> 23:43.982
Yeah, right.

23:44.049 --> 23:45.955
Go ahead, take my prints.

23:46.022 --> 23:48.096
So what's the story with the video?

23:48.163 --> 23:50.739
Man, I left the Sean
John party, swerving.

23:50.806 --> 23:54.619
Big bubble butt on one
hand, bottle in the other.

23:54.686 --> 23:56.526
Went back to the room and I passed out

23:56.592 --> 23:58.198
before I could even get my lay on.

23:58.265 --> 24:00.673
When I woke up, I had
a gun and a video camera

24:00.741 --> 24:01.844
shoved in my face.

24:01.912 --> 24:03.984
Y'all know where that ended up.

24:04.051 --> 24:06.829
Next thing I know, I'm in my
luggage with a fat-ass lip.

24:06.895 --> 24:08.132
What'd the guy look like?

24:08.199 --> 24:10.507
I don't know. He had on a mask.

24:10.574 --> 24:12.179
Anyone following you at the time?

24:12.246 --> 24:14.621
Man, I was so blunted and liquored up,

24:14.689 --> 24:15.725
I have no idea.

24:17.063 --> 24:18.003
Yo.

24:18.038 --> 24:21.009
Listen, man, y'all find
out who did this for me,

24:21.077 --> 24:23.084
like, I'm telling you,
like, I'll take care of you.

24:23.150 --> 24:24.924
I'll give you a whole
new closet full of suits.

24:24.991 --> 24:25.774
Like, whatever you want.

24:25.809 --> 24:27.707
Like, you'll be popping
tags for over a year.

24:27.742 --> 24:30.169
Like, you'll be the freshest cops
on the street, I swear to God.

24:30.204 --> 24:32.416
So, why would somebody
want to do this to you?

24:32.483 --> 24:34.088
Man, why wouldn't they?

24:34.155 --> 24:37.433
I've been dealing with beef like
this my entire life, you dig?

24:37.500 --> 24:40.276
I bought my first bulletproof
vest when I was 15 years old,

24:40.343 --> 24:42.050
and I wore it to school.

24:42.115 --> 24:43.521
Them putting me in that bikini, man,

24:43.588 --> 24:45.126
that poster ain't nothing, man.

24:45.193 --> 24:46.356
I'm lucky to be alive.

24:46.391 --> 24:49.040
Okay, look,

24:49.106 --> 24:50.545
why "Dudes GonNutz"?

24:50.613 --> 24:52.150
I don't know, man.

24:52.217 --> 24:55.897
I did some guest spots on the
little "Chicks Gone Nutz" video.

24:55.964 --> 24:57.603
You know, the girls
flash their thing things.

24:58.086 --> 24:59.945
Dudes just jealous, man.

25:00.012 --> 25:01.851
I dodge haters for a living.

25:01.918 --> 25:04.459
I got more enemies than
some countries got people.

25:04.527 --> 25:05.997
Give us some names.

25:07.464 --> 25:09.276
It'll be a long list.

25:10.308 --> 25:12.890
Griss, we are not having any luck

25:12.956 --> 25:15.049
identifying the three
teenagers from CC Drive.

25:15.084 --> 25:17.108
It's been two days,
no one's come forward.

25:17.143 --> 25:19.746
Without an ID, it's like
they never even existed.

25:19.814 --> 25:21.887
We need to get their
faces out in the public-

25:21.954 --> 25:23.038
newspapers, billboards.

25:23.073 --> 25:25.399
Well, maybe you could breathe

25:25.466 --> 25:27.741
a little bit more life into them.

25:27.807 --> 25:30.784
Yeah. I'm pretty good
at mouth-to-mouth.

26:43.325 --> 26:46.880
Gentra just loved the hip-hop music.

26:46.947 --> 26:51.095
And it kept her out on the streets.

26:51.162 --> 26:54.205
She actually wanted
to be a rapper herself.

26:54.273 --> 26:57.049
She did a couple of talent shows.

26:57.115 --> 26:59.491
Didn't do too well.

26:59.557 --> 27:02.902
So she joined a street team.

27:02.969 --> 27:04.107
A street team?

27:04.174 --> 27:07.184
Groups of kids who hit the streets

27:07.250 --> 27:08.989
to promote their favorite rapper.

27:11.415 --> 27:14.409
It kept Gentra around what she loved.

27:14.476 --> 27:16.567
Do you know which rapper she worked for?

27:16.602 --> 27:17.987
Hi-Def.

27:18.055 --> 27:21.366
That's what he calls himself.

27:21.433 --> 27:24.019
The State of Nevada's willing to pay

27:24.054 --> 27:28.239
to send your daughter back
to California for burial.

27:28.323 --> 27:31.723
I couldn't afford to bury my husband.

27:32.204 --> 27:35.983
In that case, she'll be cremated.

27:36.050 --> 27:38.057
I'll make sure you get the remains.

27:38.806 --> 27:41.235
You send her ashes to Hi-Def.

28:15.654 --> 28:17.125
That's our guy.

28:17.192 --> 28:19.802
The one with the tats. That's Hi-Def.

28:22.109 --> 28:24.107
Looks like Dollar's crew is here, too.

28:24.142 --> 28:26.123
MAGIC wing all the rappers.

28:26.190 --> 28:27.929
Go ahead, I'll catch up.

28:37.301 --> 28:38.149
Afternoon.

28:38.184 --> 28:39.535
You must be in the wrong spot.

28:39.570 --> 28:40.941
This isn't the security hut.

28:40.976 --> 28:42.312
We need to talk to Hi-Def.

28:42.379 --> 28:43.885
Can't wait till after the show?

28:43.950 --> 28:46.292
Either you get him or we will.

28:57.866 --> 28:59.370
What do you cops want from me?

29:00.143 --> 29:02.214
You ever see these kids?

29:03.766 --> 29:05.119
Never.

29:05.154 --> 29:06.788
I have. They're from our street team.

29:06.823 --> 29:08.275
They look kind of
weird in those pictures,

29:08.310 --> 29:10.074
but Ray never smiles.

29:10.141 --> 29:11.245
They're dead.

29:11.312 --> 29:12.081
What?

29:12.116 --> 29:13.386
They've been gone three days.

29:13.453 --> 29:14.524
You didn't notice?

29:14.991 --> 29:16.999
Don't look at me, ma'am.

29:17.065 --> 29:19.374
I never seen those
kids before ever, sorry.

29:20.352 --> 29:22.556
Look, we've got kids coming
and going all the time.

29:22.591 --> 29:23.756
It's hard to keep up.

29:23.822 --> 29:25.930
I mean, I know who they are;
it's Ray, Marvin and Gentra.

29:25.996 --> 29:27.434
Do you know their last names?

29:27.502 --> 29:29.106
No, I'm sorry.

29:29.173 --> 29:32.519
Well, do you know where they got this?

29:37.436 --> 29:39.208
Probably the same place I got this.

29:49.950 --> 29:51.785
Hey, guys.

29:51.853 --> 29:53.090
Whoa, whoa, whoa. How you doing?

29:53.156 --> 29:55.867
Let me get one of those for you.

29:55.933 --> 29:57.405
Here you go.

29:57.471 --> 29:59.111
No, thanks, man, I'm all set.

29:59.177 --> 30:00.481
You know, personally,

30:00.549 --> 30:02.488
I think it's a bad idea
to hit on blackjack.

30:02.556 --> 30:05.132
Well, you know, that's just how we do.

30:05.198 --> 30:06.135
We never bust.

30:06.686 --> 30:08.476
I know all about Dollar.

30:08.543 --> 30:10.416
What's your connection?

30:10.483 --> 30:11.422
Are you a cop?

30:11.457 --> 30:12.992
I work with the police department, yeah.

30:13.059 --> 30:16.002
Crime lab. My name's Nick Stokes.

30:16.069 --> 30:19.481
Drops. And let's just
say Dollar pays the bills.

30:19.547 --> 30:21.154
The video just showed up on my desk.

30:21.221 --> 30:22.067
First day of the show.

30:22.102 --> 30:23.825
It was in a plain manila envelope.

30:23.860 --> 30:24.904
So you put it on the net.

30:24.939 --> 30:28.078
I never said that, but things happen.

30:28.145 --> 30:30.988
Did Hi-Def and Dollar
have a beef before this?

30:31.054 --> 30:32.015
Yeah, a couple of years ago,

30:32.050 --> 30:34.331
Dollar did song called "New Vegas".

30:34.399 --> 30:36.774
Talking about how Las
Vegas is the new New York.

30:36.841 --> 30:38.680
Hi-Def is New York.

30:38.748 --> 30:40.620
He and Dollar been punking
each other ever since.

30:41.503 --> 30:43.541
What's the deal with these street teams.

30:43.576 --> 30:44.527
What's going on?

30:44.562 --> 30:47.715
They do all the filthy,
dirty, grimy promo for Dollar.

30:47.750 --> 30:50.868
Snipe posters, give away
stickers, pass CDs around.

30:50.904 --> 30:51.789
Nothing new.

30:51.824 --> 30:53.487
You know, three kids were murdered

30:53.523 --> 30:55.663
the other night doing
the exact same thing.

30:55.949 --> 30:57.156
What can I say, man?

30:57.191 --> 30:58.775
These kids run the streets, bro.

30:58.810 --> 31:02.000
Anybody at any given
time can run up on them

31:02.035 --> 31:03.232
and try and lullaby their ass.

31:03.299 --> 31:04.351
Yeah, I don't know about that.

31:04.386 --> 31:06.339
They were putting up
posters of your boy Dollar-

31:06.374 --> 31:08.497
ones that made him look a lot stupider

31:08.532 --> 31:10.792
than just hitting on
blackjack, you know what I mean?

31:12.196 --> 31:14.504
Take a look at these kids.

31:14.570 --> 31:17.548
See if you recognize any of them.

31:18.178 --> 31:19.322
Nope.

31:19.388 --> 31:20.525
Show them.

31:25.698 --> 31:27.282
Nice suit.

31:27.349 --> 31:29.339
Glad to see you dressed
for the occasion.

31:31.864 --> 31:33.336
No.

31:33.403 --> 31:36.546
Eh, sorry, Crime Lab, Nick Stokes.

31:36.613 --> 31:38.019
Nobody here's got a clue.

31:38.085 --> 31:42.560
Yeah, okay.

31:42.969 --> 31:44.876
Oh, well, what do you know?

31:44.942 --> 31:46.415
There goes one of my birds.

31:46.481 --> 31:47.752
Sorry, got to go.

31:47.819 --> 31:49.459
Peace.

31:49.526 --> 31:50.930
I'll see you soon, dawg.

31:50.997 --> 31:52.869
Yeah, whatever.

31:52.937 --> 31:55.780
Look, you need any more
posters, just scream at me.

31:55.847 --> 31:56.977
Hey, Tweety!

31:57.012 --> 31:58.720
Tweety!

32:14.415 --> 32:15.819
Hey. Hey.

32:15.886 --> 32:17.893
Mandy matched two prints off the photo

32:17.960 --> 32:19.432
that you gave to Dollar's street team

32:19.499 --> 32:21.839
to the unknowns that I
found in the low rider.

32:21.907 --> 32:23.278
One was on the passenger side door,

32:23.346 --> 32:25.988
the other one was on the steering wheel.

32:26.055 --> 32:27.961
Hey, yo, yo, yo, make sure you tell him

32:28.028 --> 32:31.339
about that crazy new suit
line we got coming out.

32:32.477 --> 32:33.647
Now what?

32:33.713 --> 32:35.387
I'm here for Drops.

32:35.454 --> 32:36.825
Hang up.

32:41.608 --> 32:43.280
I'm expanding into Asia.

32:43.348 --> 32:44.586
No kidding?

32:44.651 --> 32:46.008
Where's your street team?

32:46.494 --> 32:48.568
They're grubbing
- they went down to the Cafe Hospital.

32:48.603 --> 32:50.643
You know, they're kind of
Benigni over that Waldorf salad.

32:52.737 --> 32:54.786
They're murder suspects.

32:55.824 --> 32:58.332
Get them up here.

32:58.795 --> 33:00.541
This is very disappointing.

33:10.609 --> 33:12.549
Yo, gentlemen,

33:12.616 --> 33:14.555
on the wall.

33:18.903 --> 33:22.215
I didn't shoot nobody.

33:22.282 --> 33:26.864
Please, you got to believe me.

33:26.931 --> 33:29.540
I just wanted to drive that car.

33:29.607 --> 33:31.614
Morris was always bragging about it.

33:31.682 --> 33:34.491
I'll believe you if you
tell me what really happened.

33:36.531 --> 33:39.509
I was picking up an order for Drops.

33:39.575 --> 33:43.020
I saw that poster on the wall.

33:43.087 --> 33:46.633
I just told the other guys what I saw.

33:46.700 --> 33:48.640
Look, I know I shouldn't have done that,

33:48.707 --> 33:51.218
'cause as soon as I did,
Morris wanted to see the poster.

33:51.253 --> 33:54.125
Morris would do anything for Dollar.

33:54.192 --> 33:56.400
You know, Dollar's his life.

33:56.467 --> 33:59.578
He only has Dollar in his iPod.

33:59.644 --> 34:01.283
No one else.

34:01.350 --> 34:03.959
So then you went to CC Drive.

34:04.025 --> 34:06.668
Yeah.

34:06.736 --> 34:08.777
We just waited for them to show up.

34:08.842 --> 34:12.053
Who is "they"?

34:12.120 --> 34:13.926
Some other snippers.

34:13.994 --> 34:15.933
High-def street team.

34:16.001 --> 34:19.312
Morris didn't care who they were,

34:19.379 --> 34:21.931
as long as they was putting up
them posters, they was dead to him.

34:21.967 --> 34:22.882
Morris, hurry up, man-

34:22.917 --> 34:23.835
you just said you were gonna scare them.

34:23.870 --> 34:26.536
Nah, man. that poster
makes Dollar look like a ho.

34:26.603 --> 34:28.478
Dollar's nobody's ho.

34:36.070 --> 34:38.545
I ran them over.

34:40.552 --> 34:46.639
After he got the first one...
he said he had to get the rest.

34:46.706 --> 34:48.813
He shot the second one next,

34:48.880 --> 34:51.690
down off the palm tree.

34:54.266 --> 34:58.146
The last one almost got away.

35:03.264 --> 35:05.539
What was Dante doing during all of this?

35:06.425 --> 35:09.653
I was just riding
shotgun, watching Morris.

35:09.720 --> 35:11.660
You didn't do anything about it?

35:11.727 --> 35:13.164
He was out of his mind.

35:13.231 --> 35:15.038
Where did Morris get the gun?

35:15.106 --> 35:16.777
It was in the trunk.

35:16.845 --> 35:19.755
He said his brother swiped
it off some dumb-ass cop.

35:19.821 --> 35:20.791
Where is it now?

35:20.859 --> 35:22.598
Broken apart and thrown away.

35:22.665 --> 35:24.236
Pro style.

35:24.790 --> 35:25.809
Looks like you and your buddy

35:25.876 --> 35:28.250
are gonna get broken
apart and thrown away, too.

35:28.316 --> 35:30.625
I guess there's nothing else to say.

35:30.692 --> 35:33.736
Guess not.

35:59.458 --> 36:00.963
<i>This ain't right, dog.</i>

36:01.030 --> 36:03.873
<i>Now who's the bitch? Huh?</i>

36:03.940 --> 36:05.980
<i>Who's the bitch now?</i>

36:37.991 --> 36:39.529
I figure Dante had that revolver

36:39.596 --> 36:41.536
when he was going up
and down those poles.

36:41.603 --> 36:42.708
Grip gets thumped,

36:42.743 --> 36:45.383
chips off in the satchel.

36:45.450 --> 36:47.122
Wood grain seems consistent,

36:47.190 --> 36:50.133
This means Dante made the video.

36:50.200 --> 36:52.842
You said Dante works for Dollar.

36:52.909 --> 36:55.250
He's a fan.

36:55.318 --> 36:57.960
Why would he humiliate
someone he respects?

36:59.030 --> 37:01.740
I don't know.

37:01.806 --> 37:04.616
I don't know, but on the video,

37:04.683 --> 37:07.927
Dante did say, "Who's the bitch now?"

37:07.994 --> 37:11.774
So... you could say it
got a little personal.

37:12.888 --> 37:17.728
So... get personal.

38:21.482 --> 38:25.261
<i>Yo, what's up, it's your boy
Dollar, from Chicks Gone Nuts.</i>

38:25.328 --> 38:27.201
<i>We're out here in Vegas, baby.</i>

38:27.268 --> 38:30.681
<i>We got whatever you want
- chicks, jewelry.</i>

38:30.747 --> 38:31.917
<i>We got the bottles.</i>

38:31.984 --> 38:34.059
<i>Come holler at us, you know.</i>

38:37.838 --> 38:41.451
So you obviously know Dollar.

38:41.517 --> 38:43.591
You know, your brother has been arrested

38:43.659 --> 38:45.999
for felony kidnapping and assault

38:46.066 --> 38:47.605
and accessory to murder.

38:47.673 --> 38:49.446
Now if there's anything that you know

38:49.481 --> 38:52.422
that can help us
understand his motivation,

38:52.489 --> 38:54.596
now's the time to tell us, okay?

38:57.640 --> 39:01.587
Tisha...

39:01.654 --> 39:03.861
what happened to your face?

39:08.377 --> 39:13.427
About a year ago, during
Black Spring Break,

39:13.495 --> 39:16.036
Dollar caught me
walking through the MGM.

39:16.103 --> 39:18.110
He was hosting this
Chicks Gone Nuts video.

39:18.177 --> 39:20.251
Said he'd give me
$500 to put on a bikini

39:20.318 --> 39:22.794
and jump on his hotel bed.

39:23.550 --> 39:26.305
I needed the money...

39:26.372 --> 39:29.617
so I did it.

39:29.684 --> 39:32.393
I got my money and went home.

39:32.460 --> 39:35.494
Couple months later, Dante came
busting into my room with the tape.

39:37.578 --> 39:43.900
He cussed me out, then
forgot about that, too.

39:45.941 --> 39:48.984
Until my dad saw the tape.

39:53.398 --> 39:58.383
He called me a whore and a slut.

39:58.450 --> 40:02.865
He had his car keys in his hand.

40:02.932 --> 40:07.682
He cut up my face, my chest,

40:09.198 --> 40:13.697
my stomach.

40:14.471 --> 40:17.962
I haven't seen him since.

40:20.291 --> 40:23.528
And Dante blamed Dollar.

40:23.938 --> 40:28.453
He couldn't find Daddy.

40:28.520 --> 40:31.097
He wouldn't blame me.

40:31.163 --> 40:34.173
So he joins Dollar's street team

40:34.239 --> 40:37.518
to get close to him,
close enough to sneak

40:37.585 --> 40:41.264
into his hotel room and videotape him,

40:41.331 --> 40:44.575
the same way he videotaped you.

40:48.427 --> 40:52.270
I know he didn't mean for anyone to die.

40:52.369 --> 40:55.748
He just did it for me.
