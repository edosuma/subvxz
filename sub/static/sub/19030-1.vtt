WEBVTT

00:07.275 --> 00:07.642
That's new.

00:07.944 --> 00:10.445
Oh, yeah. My girlfriend
gave me a watch.

00:10.455 --> 00:12.281
Do you give a crap,
or are you just hoping

00:12.291 --> 00:13.829
that by pointing out
something new of mine,

00:14.099 --> 00:17.856
I'll segue the conversation into talking
about something new of yours, like...

00:18.526 --> 00:21.235
Your new prepubescent
"Miami Vice" beard.

00:21.365 --> 00:23.859
There are those who say I look
like a young Kenny Loggins.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.865
- Who?
- Me.

00:26.504 --> 00:27.769
<i>Time to go
teach the new interns.</i>

00:27.901 --> 00:29.653
<i>They started a week ago,</i>

00:29.793 --> 00:31.130
<i>and they sucked!</i>

00:32.084 --> 00:36.455
This patient's loss of temperature
sensation on the contralateral side

00:36.577 --> 00:38.874
is consistent
with which syndrome, Rodney?

00:39.288 --> 00:42.265
<i>There was Katie,
the self-centered climber...</i>

00:42.466 --> 00:43.489
McConaughey's.

00:44.460 --> 00:44.927
McConaughey's.

00:45.761 --> 00:46.761
McConaughey is not a syndrome.

00:46.771 --> 00:48.697
He is, however, one of
our finest working actors.

00:48.699 --> 00:51.000
I recently learned
how I could lose him in 10 days.

00:51.137 --> 00:53.438
Katie is sabotaging you,
I assume,

00:53.448 --> 00:56.880
- because she knows the answer.
- Brown-sequard syndrome.

00:57.041 --> 00:58.710
Yay, Katie got it.

00:59.780 --> 01:01.914
<i>There was Denise,
who could be a bit callous...</i>

01:02.784 --> 01:03.518
You know...

01:03.519 --> 01:05.854
It's ironic that "cancer"
starts with "can,"

01:06.587 --> 01:07.320
because at this stage,

01:07.626 --> 01:09.227
there's nothing
we can do about it.

01:09.929 --> 01:12.462
Let's take a walk, sunshine.
I...

01:14.066 --> 01:14.632
<i>And there was Ed.</i>

01:15.005 --> 01:17.238
Ed, did you finish
those case reports last night?

01:17.248 --> 01:19.175
Ah! I totally
was gonna do it, man,

01:19.185 --> 01:21.176
but I was on this "Lost"
fan site last night

01:21.879 --> 01:22.613
talking to this chick.

01:23.346 --> 01:26.213
About an hour in, I realize
it's a dude messin' with me.

01:26.553 --> 01:28.722
- I've been there.
- Revenge time.

01:28.732 --> 01:31.612
I signed up for a new account--
Hotgirl99.

01:31.773 --> 01:33.017
I start flirtin'
with this dude.

01:33.206 --> 01:34.621
I'm like, "Oh, hey,
I look just like Kate."

01:34.741 --> 01:36.465
And he's totally into it,
right?

01:36.556 --> 01:38.251
Next thing you know,
I got him to agree

01:38.412 --> 01:40.591
to a personal meet-up
here in the hospital

01:41.022 --> 01:43.008
where he'll be holding
a red balloon.

01:46.819 --> 01:51.320
- Wait a minute, you're Hotgirl99?
- Yeah.

01:52.755 --> 01:55.456
- The new interns all suck!
- Yeah, but I'm gonna handle it.

01:55.692 --> 01:57.859
Like you handled
Jimmy the overly-touchy orderly?

01:58.629 --> 02:00.230
Somebody looking for me?

02:01.000 --> 02:01.734
No, Jimmy, we're fine.

02:01.744 --> 02:04.236
All right. Let me know if
you need anything. Okay.

02:04.246 --> 02:06.930
Have you noticed he only
touches above the waist now?

02:07.061 --> 02:08.074
You're welcome.

02:08.255 --> 02:11.347
You know, our intern class
was the last good one.

02:12.073 --> 02:13.583
You must've liked my class
a little,

02:13.713 --> 02:14.567
seeing as you almost
married me.

02:14.619 --> 02:17.352
Mm, yeah, but hello, Keith,
I didn't.

02:19.025 --> 02:20.826
<i>That was harsh,
but no one cared</i>

02:20.836 --> 02:23.596
<i>because today we were meeting
Dr. Kelso's replacement</i>

02:23.666 --> 02:25.967
<i>as Chief of Medicine--
Dr. Taylor Maddox.</i>

02:26.502 --> 02:29.436
<i>She was smokin' hot, so first
I had to see her like this...</i>

02:35.315 --> 02:37.983
<i>I wanna be your lover, baby,
I wanna be your man</i>

02:38.084 --> 02:40.852
<i>I don't want no other, baby,
want you again and again</i>

02:41.723 --> 02:43.591
<i>and I've waited
all night long</i>

02:43.742 --> 02:45.187
<i>now I know what I wanna do</i>

02:46.129 --> 02:50.326
<i>I just wanna make
love to you, come on!</i>

02:55.676 --> 02:57.086
<i>Yeah!</i>

02:57.265 --> 02:59.269
Hi. Hi.

02:59.379 --> 03:01.249
<i>But then I noticed
how friendly she seemed.</i>

03:01.259 --> 03:04.117
<i>She had the most infectious
smile. No one could resist it.</i>

03:04.282 --> 03:06.509
- And I mean no one.
- No.

03:06.601 --> 03:07.525
Yes!

03:08.988 --> 03:09.755
Never!

03:11.164 --> 03:11.864
Here it comes!

03:15.524 --> 03:19.603
- Clear.
- Aah!

03:20.108 --> 03:21.208
Brava!

03:22.142 --> 03:22.642
Oh, yeah!

03:23.081 --> 03:23.915
Yes!

03:25.850 --> 03:27.051
You proud fool.

03:27.061 --> 03:30.924
Okay, I'm gonna tell you everything
you need to know about me.

03:31.727 --> 03:32.793
One-- I have an open door policy.

03:33.699 --> 03:36.633
Two-- if you do your job well,
you're great with me. Okay?

03:37.066 --> 03:38.533
And three-- I don't like spiders.

03:38.543 --> 03:40.504
So if you see one,
I want you to stomp it.

03:40.514 --> 03:42.471
I want you to stomp it dead,
okay?

03:42.481 --> 03:44.475
I don't want you
to put it into a little cup

03:44.485 --> 03:46.478
and take it outside,
because it'll just

03:46.488 --> 03:48.548
find its way back in, okay?
They're sneaky.

03:48.883 --> 03:51.321
Oh, can someone help that man
to his room?

03:52.686 --> 03:55.168
Oh. No, I-I'm not sick.

03:55.681 --> 03:58.302
I'm just cold,
and there were no chairs.

03:59.826 --> 04:01.577
I'm-- I'm a lawyer.

04:02.099 --> 04:05.110
- Of course you are, sweetie.
- I'm on it.

04:06.113 --> 04:07.398
She's the new boss, Ted.

04:08.341 --> 04:09.717
Aah!

04:12.072 --> 04:12.747
Does it hurt here?

04:13.046 --> 04:15.415
Or here? How about here?
Or under here?

04:16.497 --> 04:16.964
Do I know you?

04:18.322 --> 04:19.089
Jimmy, heel!

04:19.100 --> 04:22.229
Slowly move. Just slowly move.
Don't rush anything. No, Jimmy.

04:23.132 --> 04:24.866
Oh, Jimmy.
Breathe deep for me real slow.

04:24.967 --> 04:27.534
I just wanna feel you breathe.

04:28.773 --> 04:31.040
Yeah. That's a boy.
That's a boy. That's a boy.

04:32.141 --> 04:32.974
Good. Breathe on my face.

04:33.767 --> 04:36.306

04:46.619 --> 04:49.239
<i>Okay, time to connect
with the new chief</i>

04:49.360 --> 04:52.851
<i>using a picture of my son
and some brilliant acting.</i>

04:54.136 --> 04:54.761
Oh! Is that your boy?

04:54.994 --> 04:56.994
What's that? Oh, yeah.

04:57.736 --> 04:59.902
- His name is Sam.
- I have a daughter of my own.

05:01.280 --> 05:02.483
<i>It's working!</i>

05:02.894 --> 05:03.274
<i>Now seal the deal</i>

05:03.609 --> 05:06.277
<i>with a follow-up question,
but nothing too personal.</i>

05:07.448 --> 05:08.315
Did you deliver vaginally?

05:09.614 --> 05:10.644
I did.

05:11.077 --> 05:13.054
Big girl. Must've hurt.

05:13.457 --> 05:14.350
Wow.

05:16.294 --> 05:20.509
Hi, Mr. Hicks. So you were
admitted to the hospital

05:20.642 --> 05:22.246
- with shortness of breath?
- Yes, that's right.

05:22.859 --> 05:23.998
Okay, so I'm just gonna...

05:24.691 --> 05:26.585
Die! Die! Die!

05:26.909 --> 05:29.318
Sorry. Spider. Um,
I'm just gonna take you up

05:29.399 --> 05:33.617
- and get you a full-body scan, okay?
- Yeah.

05:34.718 --> 05:35.351
And there she goes.

05:35.586 --> 05:38.287
A chief of medicine working
one-on-one with a patient?

05:39.491 --> 05:41.081
Maybe she's not so bad.

05:41.411 --> 05:43.197
- I think she's probably a jerk.
- Why?

05:43.388 --> 05:44.431
That position
attracts jerks.

05:45.568 --> 05:47.541
Plus, well, I know jerks.

05:47.691 --> 05:50.098
Hell, I married a jerk.
I divorced a jerk.

05:50.268 --> 05:52.696
- New freckle.
- I'm interrupted by jerks.

05:52.937 --> 05:54.825
Look, just give me two minutes
with this Maddox,

05:54.924 --> 05:57.337
and I'll know for sure
whether or not she's a jerk.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.450
Well, go!

05:58.661 --> 05:59.613
Pass.

06:04.479 --> 06:06.004
I know people are down
on these new interns,

06:06.225 --> 06:07.649
but everyone's teachable,
you know?

06:08.366 --> 06:10.138
- Even Jo.
- Who?

06:10.288 --> 06:13.247
I like to call Denise "Jo"
because she reminds me

06:13.439 --> 06:16.018
of that streetwise, mannish girl
on "Facts of Life."

06:16.243 --> 06:18.602
You know,
Katie's cutesy and blonde.

06:18.874 --> 06:20.922
- You could call her "Blair."
- "Blair" is stupid.

06:20.957 --> 06:21.415
<i>"Blair" is perfect,</i>

06:21.952 --> 06:24.488
<i>but now I can never use it
in front of Turk,</i>

06:24.657 --> 06:27.658
<i>or he'll say 'You're welcome!'
in that really smug way of his.</i>

06:27.668 --> 06:31.029
Okay, let's gather 'round
for rounds.

06:31.142 --> 06:33.307
Get it? "'round for rounds"?
You can use it.

06:33.331 --> 06:36.636
Our first patient is
presenting with biliary colic...

06:36.707 --> 06:39.108
And, uh-- Ed, would--
Would you mind-- would you mind

06:39.118 --> 06:41.509
turning off the beeping
if you're gonna text?

06:41.880 --> 06:44.081
- I'll turn it off.
- Thank you!

06:44.091 --> 06:48.509
Uh, upper right abdominal pain.
What's your diagnosis... Jo?

06:48.648 --> 06:48.960
I know.

06:49.501 --> 06:51.088
Of course you do, Katie,
because you know anything

06:51.208 --> 06:53.505
that anyone's ever asked
you ever. But I didn't ask you.

06:53.655 --> 06:54.418
I asked Jo.

06:54.586 --> 06:57.076
Well, the patient definitely
looks like hell, so--

06:57.307 --> 06:59.095
Quick side note--
When a patient's eyes are open,

06:59.405 --> 07:00.720
that usually means
that they're awake.

07:00.755 --> 07:02.637
Sorry, Mrs. Gallagher.
You look very beautiful today.

07:03.274 --> 07:03.674
Doesn't she?

07:04.109 --> 07:06.177
Yeah, your jaundice
makes you glow.

07:06.282 --> 07:08.871
Yes, yellow like the sun.

07:09.203 --> 07:12.289
- Ed, stop texting!
- I'm not texting.

07:12.458 --> 07:14.181
I'm looking at photos
of Sienna Miller's breasts.

07:14.303 --> 07:15.267
There's a difference.

07:15.418 --> 07:18.202
Okay, well, do that more
later, when we're together.

07:18.735 --> 07:19.637
Jo, you were saying?

07:19.757 --> 07:21.654
I'm guessing Mrs. Gallagher
probably has cholecy--

07:21.654 --> 07:23.068
Cholecystitis.
She has cholecystitis.

07:23.234 --> 07:25.801
- I'm gonna cut your throat.
- Okay, that's enough, Jo.

07:25.811 --> 07:27.847
- You, too, Blair.
- Welcome!

07:27.977 --> 07:29.151
Damn it!

07:29.403 --> 07:30.999
 If you want,
you can call me "Tootie."

07:31.034 --> 07:32.245
- I don't think it's racist.
- Oh, oh, fine.

07:32.255 --> 07:36.082
I'm Tootie, and I know how
to go on the web and BitTorrent.

07:36.263 --> 07:39.549
You probably shouldn't be texting
while you're leading rounds.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.714
I'm-- Oh, I'm-- th--
this is his phone.

07:41.815 --> 07:43.783
- It's not my phone.
- W.T.H?!

07:43.953 --> 07:46.099
Oh, fine. It's not your phone.
Hey, want a phone, buddy?

07:49.707 --> 07:50.107
No.

07:50.117 --> 07:52.109
All right, listen,
I want you

07:52.119 --> 07:54.422
to run some renal function tests
on Mr. Hicks.

07:54.531 --> 07:57.110
Can you do that, or do you have
more questions about my vagina?

07:57.280 --> 07:57.945
<i>Lie!</i>

07:58.751 --> 07:59.151
No.

07:59.983 --> 08:00.117
Hmm.

08:00.354 --> 08:03.214
Dr. Maddox,
I just wanted to say

08:03.214 --> 08:04.958
how excited I am to
be working with you.

08:06.597 --> 08:07.431
Katie is such a kiss ass.

08:08.133 --> 08:10.500
You mean "mini-Elliot"?

08:10.935 --> 08:13.168
What? That's what
everybody's calling her.

08:13.178 --> 08:14.838
It's probably
just because we are...

08:15.777 --> 08:17.411
Both blonde
and have perky boobs.

08:18.412 --> 08:19.350
Or...

08:19.510 --> 08:22.299
It's because she is incredibly
whiny and self-involved,

08:22.429 --> 08:24.536
and you, Barboo, for the last
year and a half or so,

08:24.637 --> 08:28.362
have been the most self-involved
and whiny person in the galaxy.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.034
What nobody understands
about me...

08:30.935 --> 08:31.794
Point proven. Thank you.

08:32.933 --> 08:33.400
Okay...

08:34.402 --> 08:35.034
Mm, suck-up's back.

08:35.967 --> 08:36.501
You're abrasive.

08:37.169 --> 08:37.870
That's enough, Blair.

08:38.374 --> 08:39.842
- Welcome!
- Damn it!

08:39.852 --> 08:42.779
Okay, listen up, guys. I gotta
go take care of Mr. Hicks,

08:43.148 --> 08:45.983
so I need you guys to watch
the floor. Check every patient

08:45.993 --> 08:48.152
and switch out any lines
that need changing.

08:48.162 --> 08:50.221
Monitor Mr. Lombardi's
blood gas,

08:50.223 --> 08:52.323
and intubate him
if he starts getting acidotic.

08:52.461 --> 08:54.362
Work as a team,
you'll be all over it.

08:54.372 --> 08:56.362
Let's have some hands in,
okay?

08:56.372 --> 08:58.030
Somebody has some
very soft hands.

08:58.199 --> 08:59.392
I sleep in gloves.

08:59.702 --> 09:00.602
Right on.
Okay, nobody die!

09:02.669 --> 09:03.236
Nobody die!

09:04.810 --> 09:05.210
Dr. Kelso...

09:05.747 --> 09:09.270
Now that you're retired,
I can finally say this.

09:09.482 --> 09:10.596
You, sir...

09:13.113 --> 09:15.231
- Oh, I can't do it.
- You'll get there, Ted.

09:17.196 --> 09:19.898
- What's with the balloon?
- It's been a sad day.

09:19.908 --> 09:21.933
Can you even believe Dr. Cox?

09:23.033 --> 09:25.035
calling me whiny
and self-involved?

09:25.104 --> 09:28.204
Elliot, you know how
we're so close

09:28.334 --> 09:30.192
we can say anything
to each other, right?

09:30.301 --> 09:30.673
Yeah?

09:31.304 --> 09:33.148
Look, over the last year
or so,

09:33.158 --> 09:35.181
you've been going through
a lot.

09:36.720 --> 09:37.253
You got engaged.

09:39.259 --> 09:41.760
You broke off your wedding
at the last second.

09:42.031 --> 09:44.799
It'd be easy for anyone to
become a little self-absorbed.

09:46.607 --> 09:47.507
What are you saying,
Carla?

09:48.738 --> 09:50.473
This is why
I come here every day.

09:51.676 --> 09:53.095
You come here every day?

09:53.698 --> 09:55.182
Loser!

09:56.569 --> 09:58.035
My balloon!

10:00.862 --> 10:03.632
Mr. Hicks' renal tests
came back negative.

10:03.724 --> 10:04.801
Thank God.

10:04.822 --> 10:07.369
See, Bernie isn't just
a patient. He's also my lover.

10:09.717 --> 10:10.540
Really?

10:11.693 --> 10:13.821
No!
He's fat, bald and ugly!

10:14.132 --> 10:15.498
- Thanks a lot!
- Aah!

10:15.533 --> 10:17.745
<i>Okay, just swallow your pain
and fix this.</i>

10:19.146 --> 10:19.714
Look, Dr. Maddox,

10:20.417 --> 10:22.398
I think you're
a very well-built...

10:23.221 --> 10:25.549
Sturdy woman.

10:26.001 --> 10:26.693
Like a shed.

10:27.086 --> 10:29.309
No, not like a shed.
Like a...

10:29.752 --> 10:31.426
Naughty...

10:31.890 --> 10:32.783
- Like it.
- Structure.

10:33.747 --> 10:35.331
- Structure?
- I should go.

10:38.310 --> 10:39.112
Ugh! Aah!

10:39.718 --> 10:43.377
Stop confusing me by being nice
and giving me phones.

10:43.658 --> 10:46.909
Fine! But why did you
have to trip me?

10:47.160 --> 10:49.027
Let me answer that question
with another question--

10:49.197 --> 10:50.492
'cause I wanted to?

10:52.567 --> 10:54.859
- Ahem! Excuse me.
- Yeah?

10:55.298 --> 10:57.105
Do you think
it would've been funny

10:57.217 --> 10:58.551
if he had broken his neck?

11:00.281 --> 11:01.826
I feel like
you want me to say "no."

11:01.955 --> 11:04.409
- What's your name?
- Oh, boy. You really are new here.

11:06.507 --> 11:07.665
Uh-oh.

11:08.277 --> 11:10.713
- "The Janitor."
- Howdy!

11:12.186 --> 11:12.652
Oh, say, Beth,

11:12.690 --> 11:15.474
your patient Mr. Lombardi
is about to crash.

11:15.896 --> 11:16.708
How'd that happen?

11:17.190 --> 11:19.690
Well, sometimes
when people get owies

11:19.800 --> 11:22.750
and they're left untreated,
they become even bigger owies.

11:22.902 --> 11:25.710
Hey! You guys are supposed
to tube him if he got acidotic.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.397
- What the hell?!
- He's not my patient, man.

11:27.708 --> 11:28.476
Uh, I-I was over there.

11:28.811 --> 11:30.756
Now he's coding.

11:31.519 --> 11:32.259
Crash cart!

11:33.132 --> 11:34.598
<i>Sometimes just two words</i>

11:34.768 --> 11:36.583
<i>are enough to make your
thoughts perfectly clear...</i>

11:36.997 --> 11:39.456
So you actually agree
with what Dr. Cox said about me?

11:40.254 --> 11:42.229
<i>Whether you're being
brutally honest...</i>

11:42.520 --> 11:43.483
I do.

11:44.758 --> 11:46.262
<i>Or holding someone
accountable...</i>

11:47.136 --> 11:47.570
You're fired.

11:49.035 --> 11:49.969
What about my son?

11:50.611 --> 11:51.889
That's my daughter!

11:54.709 --> 11:56.936
I'm-- I'm-- I'm-- I'm sorry.
May I see it again?

11:58.133 --> 11:58.484
Please?

11:59.693 --> 12:03.122
Aah! Eeh!

12:04.122 --> 12:05.923
<i>Or apologizing
for a major screwup.</i>

12:06.863 --> 12:07.822
We're sorry.

12:07.963 --> 12:09.650
Yeah. We'll-- we'll get it
together from now on.

12:09.759 --> 12:10.212
Promise.

12:10.934 --> 12:14.182
<i>But for some reason,
I didn't want to hear it.</i>

12:14.298 --> 12:16.250
You know what?
I'm done with you guys.

12:20.052 --> 12:22.646
Hey, C-Bear,
every time I see Maddox,

12:22.747 --> 12:24.844
I get one step closer
to ending my career.

12:25.265 --> 12:28.328
- Aw, you'll be fine. Maddox seems cool.
- I don't know about that.

12:28.468 --> 12:30.104
I- I just can't
shake the feeling

12:30.224 --> 12:33.264
- that woman is a complete tool.
- You've been saying that all day.

12:33.349 --> 12:35.532
Why don't you just go talk to her
and figure it out once and for all?

12:36.254 --> 12:36.669
Nah.

12:37.766 --> 12:39.060
Hey, aren't you
supposed to be at rounds?

12:39.191 --> 12:40.646
Oh, they're driving me crazy.

12:40.681 --> 12:43.511
Someone needs to send those
interns to an internment camp.

12:44.082 --> 12:46.051
Dude, internment camps
are never funny.

12:46.061 --> 12:48.213
<i>I always forget that Turk
is one-eighth Japanese.</i>

12:50.427 --> 12:53.722
Hey, can you give Mr. Hicks
a full cardiac workup?

12:53.843 --> 12:55.057
Of course.

12:55.249 --> 12:57.106
And what would you say
if I said he was my lover?

12:57.141 --> 12:59.315
I'd know that obviously
you were joking

12:59.435 --> 13:01.263
because you are
way out of his league.

13:02.713 --> 13:05.130
Oh, there-- there
that is. We're doing this. Okay.

13:05.281 --> 13:06.757
- I like you the best.
- Oh.

13:07.804 --> 13:09.926
Thanks, mom...
Ma'am. Ma'am.

13:10.037 --> 13:11.199
She's not your mom.

13:11.370 --> 13:13.586
Well, she certainly doesn't
think that I'm all about me.

13:14.387 --> 13:15.187
I was just being honest.

13:15.625 --> 13:17.160
I'd want you
to do the same for me

13:17.170 --> 13:19.231
if I were doing things
I might regret later.

13:19.241 --> 13:22.194
Name one thing that I've done
lately that I'm gonna regret.

13:23.183 --> 13:23.605
Mmm!

13:24.317 --> 13:25.923
- Oh!
- Hey, blondie!

13:26.508 --> 13:27.641
- Ahh.
- Show me your rack!

13:28.672 --> 13:28.772
No!

13:29.145 --> 13:31.109
Ooh! Yah!

13:32.362 --> 13:35.082
Oh, like that
is gonna come back to haunt me.

13:37.825 --> 13:39.858
- What else you got?
- Well, what about the way

13:39.868 --> 13:42.263
you're always mocking Keith
about not marrying him?

13:43.397 --> 13:46.280
You probably don't even realize
how devastated he still is.

13:47.959 --> 13:48.601
Oh, hey, ladies!

13:49.874 --> 13:50.708
Awesome day, huh?

13:51.371 --> 13:52.209
Awesome!

13:53.334 --> 13:55.111
Ugh.
I hope he'll pull through.

13:57.985 --> 14:00.760
And now on to our next patient.

14:01.322 --> 14:02.797
Let's go, bitches!

14:03.429 --> 14:05.853
Why is Dr. Squeaky Pants
leading rounds?

14:05.983 --> 14:07.209
Where the hell is Dorian?

14:08.763 --> 14:10.610
Keith is not
still devastated.

14:10.751 --> 14:12.025
I mean, what the hell
is Carla talking about?

14:12.213 --> 14:15.419
- She's completely off base, right?
- I have to disagree with you.

14:15.549 --> 14:17.217
You don't see my point at all?

14:17.378 --> 14:19.555
You don't understand.
I'm married to Carla, right?

14:20.188 --> 14:21.666
She has spies everywhere.

14:21.807 --> 14:23.594
So I have to disagree with you.

14:27.889 --> 14:29.890
I'm on to you, Rochelle.

14:32.358 --> 14:34.063
Dr. Reid?
May I talk to you?

14:38.837 --> 14:39.637
Ted, are you gonna talk?

14:40.244 --> 14:41.613
In a second.
I'm just waiting

14:41.623 --> 14:44.088
for the anti-anxiety medication
to kick in.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.357
And... There it is.

14:48.053 --> 14:48.387
Hey, baby.

14:48.621 --> 14:51.042
Yeah, Ted,
I'm actually in charge

14:51.152 --> 14:52.389
of keeping
a lot of people alive, so--

14:52.895 --> 14:54.364
Carla's right.
Keith's a mess.

14:54.374 --> 14:57.298
He hasn't been able to pull out
of it since you ended things.

14:57.500 --> 15:00.069
- He's sad all the time.
- Yeah, I don't see it.

15:01.004 --> 15:01.670
Of course you don't.

15:02.106 --> 15:04.467
No one ever wants
the person who hurt them

15:04.569 --> 15:06.344
to ever see how badly
they've been hurt.

15:14.435 --> 15:15.323
- Morning.
- Morning.

15:15.591 --> 15:17.358
<i>It's amazing
how the exact same question</i>

15:18.565 --> 15:20.167
<i>can have
totally different connotations.</i>

15:21.565 --> 15:22.454
May I talk to you?

15:23.487 --> 15:24.341
May I talk to you?

15:26.698 --> 15:27.625
May I talk to you?

15:28.737 --> 15:31.047
I have to ask,
when I fired you before...

15:31.318 --> 15:33.888
- Did you think I was kidding?
- No, I knew you were serious

15:33.998 --> 15:35.361
'cause I heard that you fired
Jimmy the orderly.

15:35.462 --> 15:36.174
What'd he do?

15:37.424 --> 15:39.792
Okay, this is where
you keep all of the tension.

15:40.466 --> 15:42.300
Do you mind
if I do a yogi chant?

15:42.965 --> 15:43.731
It relaxes the muscles.

15:45.103 --> 15:48.000
Ha, maya, maya, ma-ha!

15:49.263 --> 15:50.338
- Do you feel that?
- Mm-hmm.

15:50.348 --> 15:53.145
But that's just Jimmy
being Jimmy.

15:53.735 --> 15:55.342
You know, the incident yesterday
with Dr. Dorian--

15:55.543 --> 15:57.390
I swear to you
that will never happen again...

15:57.751 --> 15:58.544
Even though he deserved it.

15:58.579 --> 16:01.421
- I don't know.
- Come on! I've been here forever.

16:01.592 --> 16:03.445
You can't just throw me
out of the hospital.

16:03.595 --> 16:06.657
No, but I can walk you out
without you even noticing.

16:09.301 --> 16:10.727
Well-played.

16:11.079 --> 16:13.240
- I need your keys.
- Mmm.

16:14.347 --> 16:16.313
- Where are the rest?
- I got tired of carrying 'em all,

16:16.422 --> 16:18.551
so I made one that works
on everything. Watch!

16:22.651 --> 16:23.318
Huh? How about that?

16:23.622 --> 16:26.056
Come on. Hit the highway!

16:28.924 --> 16:29.646
Thank you.

16:33.777 --> 16:34.385
No!

16:39.165 --> 16:39.409
Keith...

16:41.601 --> 16:43.527
I just realized that I
never really took the time

16:43.637 --> 16:46.719
to apologize for the way
things ended between us.

16:48.726 --> 16:49.022
I mean, I did say

16:49.259 --> 16:52.027
that I was so sorry right
when it happened. Remember?

16:53.062 --> 16:54.232
We were outside,

16:54.412 --> 16:56.132
I gave you the ring back,
you started crying and cr--

16:56.234 --> 16:57.308
Uh, no need to recap,
Elliot.

16:57.470 --> 16:58.482
Right.

16:59.606 --> 17:01.506
Look, I know
this was my decision,

17:01.575 --> 17:04.011
so it was easier for me
to move on,

17:04.380 --> 17:06.813
and, well, you know,
make jokes and stuff.

17:06.823 --> 17:09.184
I guess that I've been
so self-involved

17:09.921 --> 17:12.589
I never stopped to think
that you still may be hurting.

17:13.791 --> 17:16.261
Anyway, I just wanted
to really apologize...

17:18.391 --> 17:18.891
For everything.

17:20.963 --> 17:21.195
Thanks.

17:22.636 --> 17:23.136
It means a lot.

17:25.007 --> 17:26.032
- Hug?
- No.

17:26.785 --> 17:27.075
Okay.

17:28.801 --> 17:30.785
Why would you pass off
your interns?

17:31.075 --> 17:32.551
I just-- I can't deal
with them anymore.

17:32.763 --> 17:36.121
Really? Because I had an intern
just a couple of years back

17:37.122 --> 17:37.790
that I hated.

17:38.059 --> 17:39.759
Honestly,
he was so maddening

17:40.962 --> 17:43.629
that my therapist put me
on a suicide/homicide watch.

17:44.634 --> 17:45.367
Do I know this intern?

17:46.770 --> 17:47.871
- Intimately.
- I figured.

17:48.301 --> 17:51.069
This is a teaching hospital.
You have to teach.

17:52.076 --> 17:52.309
I know.

17:52.319 --> 17:56.021
I'm just-- I'm-- I'm so tired
of their attitude

17:56.021 --> 17:56.713
and I'm tired
of their ignorance.

17:56.880 --> 17:59.507
It's the same thing
year after year.

17:59.629 --> 18:00.782
I'm just...

18:01.890 --> 18:02.290
Tired.

18:03.092 --> 18:04.093
<i>Here comes the tongue-lashing.</i>

18:05.518 --> 18:06.651
Boy, I get that.

18:09.028 --> 18:10.530
Why do you think I've been
avoiding the new chief?

18:11.152 --> 18:14.714
Because if I do talk to her,
and she is indeed a jerk,

18:14.955 --> 18:17.393
then once again,
I'm gonna have to be that guy

18:17.564 --> 18:20.254
who gets in her face
over every little injustice.

18:20.450 --> 18:23.550
But you wanna know something?
I'm tired, too.

18:24.487 --> 18:26.722
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.

18:27.761 --> 18:30.080
<i>Oh, my God!
He's treating me like an equal.</i>

18:30.643 --> 18:32.711
<i>Quick, do something equals do!</i>

18:37.406 --> 18:38.729
Why would you do that?

18:38.880 --> 18:40.596
I don't know.
I thought equals shared coffee.

18:41.389 --> 18:41.708
No.

18:42.677 --> 18:44.344
So this intern
that you mentioned...

18:44.914 --> 18:46.115
Earlier,
I'm sure eventually

18:46.249 --> 18:48.759
he turned into
a pretty amazing doctor.

18:48.890 --> 18:50.817
- Didn't he?
- Actually, it was a "she."

18:51.700 --> 18:52.317
It wasn't me?

18:52.439 --> 18:55.132
No, no, it was you.
It was you.

18:55.776 --> 18:59.069
- Hey.
- We'll get there.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.907
Okay, you get nice and comfy.

19:05.309 --> 19:07.960
Dr. Reid gave me
Mr. Hicks' test results,

19:08.100 --> 19:09.495
but they're
locked in my briefcase,

19:09.805 --> 19:10.659
and I lost the key.

19:11.541 --> 19:12.219
Allow me.

19:14.659 --> 19:15.392
Mm, loving this thing!

19:16.491 --> 19:17.492
And... Here it is.

19:17.929 --> 19:19.496
Hey, how come
all you have in here

19:19.701 --> 19:21.902
is a smiley face button
and a revolver?

19:22.170 --> 19:24.371
Well, one's in case
I get sad,

19:25.974 --> 19:28.341
and the other one's
in case I get really sad.

19:29.313 --> 19:30.357
Well, see you tomorrow.

19:30.768 --> 19:31.364
We'll see.

19:34.677 --> 19:34.985
Ah.

19:36.290 --> 19:38.325
Oh, Mr. Hicks'
cardiac test results.

19:38.460 --> 19:39.827
- They're negative.
- Hmm.

19:39.837 --> 19:41.829
What do you know
about that?

19:41.839 --> 19:43.766
Just like the 100 other tests
we ordered

19:43.776 --> 19:46.169
for a man who's only complaint
was shortness of breath.

19:46.204 --> 19:48.805
I assume there's a nugget
of a point buried in there.

19:48.815 --> 19:51.038
Why you running that guy
through the wringer?

19:52.074 --> 19:53.774
Because he's got
awesome insurance.

19:54.312 --> 19:55.613
He's 100%
pure profit machine.

19:56.678 --> 19:58.817
Ca... And might I add...
Ching!

19:59.932 --> 20:01.427
I mean, I may even order
an M.R.I

20:01.558 --> 20:03.152
just to see if he's actually
stuffed with money.

20:03.594 --> 20:05.926
In fact,
I think I'm ordering one.

20:06.086 --> 20:08.085
And since you cried about it,
why don't you

20:08.205 --> 20:10.162
take him to radiology
like a good little boy?

20:10.603 --> 20:12.036
[ # Catch My Disease # ]
<i>My head is a box...</i>

20:12.046 --> 20:14.440
<i>Sometimes it really sucks
to do the right thing...</i>

20:15.674 --> 20:16.887
<i>And that's the way I like it</i>

20:17.931 --> 20:21.380
<i>So, please...</i>

20:21.792 --> 20:22.785
- You were right about me...
- Baby, please!

20:24.386 --> 20:24.753
And thanks.

20:26.325 --> 20:27.117
<i>Open your heart</i>

20:27.481 --> 20:29.396
- Don't mention it.
- Love you.

20:30.363 --> 20:30.896
- I love you, too.
- Catch my disease.

20:30.906 --> 20:34.001
<i>Trying to teach
a bunch of jerks...</i>

20:34.102 --> 20:36.303
Okay, when dealing
with peripheral neuropathy,

20:36.538 --> 20:37.791
always think...

20:38.404 --> 20:40.274
Diabetes first.

20:41.010 --> 20:42.846
<i>Or once again,
facing off with a jerk.</i>

20:43.083 --> 20:46.243
Look, you can't just
bleed a guy's insurance dry

20:46.394 --> 20:48.211
just because you want to pay
for a new x-ray machine.

20:48.332 --> 20:51.827
Oh, will you shut up if I give you
a key that opens everything?

20:51.837 --> 20:54.821
The more things change,
the more they stay the same, huh?

20:55.680 --> 20:56.101
Hi, folks!

20:56.136 --> 20:58.960
If you need anything cleaned up,
just give me a shout, okay?

20:59.310 --> 21:00.164
Sure.

21:00.402 --> 21:02.903
- Who the hell is that?
- I don't know.

21:03.085 --> 21:05.052
I like him.

21:06.859 --> 21:08.906
Interns, alright!

21:09.759 --> 21:10.899
You guys psyched?
It's our eighth year.

21:11.029 --> 21:13.563
- Who's with me?
- Yay.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.565
Come on. I know it's tempting
to just mail it in,

21:15.575 --> 21:17.568
but there's still
a lot of people

21:17.578 --> 21:19.667
who rely on us week to week.
I think we owe it to them

21:20.917 --> 21:23.142
to be as inspired as we were
in our first few years.

21:23.152 --> 21:25.002
Now I know we never do great
come medical awards season...

21:25.012 --> 21:28.563
Except for Dr. Shalhoub.
He wins everything.

21:28.773 --> 21:31.068
But I still think we're as good
as anybody else out there.

21:31.751 --> 21:33.134
The Nielsens'
certainly beg to differ.

21:36.066 --> 21:36.694
Oh, they're just upset

21:36.814 --> 21:38.369
'cause their insurance
won't cover a private room.

21:38.609 --> 21:40.013
