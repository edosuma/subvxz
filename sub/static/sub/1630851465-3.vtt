00:11.136 --> 00:11.761
-Previously on
"Notorious Queens"...

00:11.762 --> 00:13.012
-I heard you're writing a book.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.555
-Yeah, I want to write
about my life.

00:14.556 --> 00:18.475
I want to write my memoir
because I want people to learn

00:18.476 --> 00:20.394
that we all go through things

00:20.395 --> 00:22.229
and we can all have
second chances.

00:22.230 --> 00:27.860
It's about, you know, coming out
and being this new person.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.778
-I'm having the same psychic
for, like, six years.

00:29.779 --> 00:31.655
Like, I wrote down
my perfect man,

00:31.656 --> 00:33.157
like everything that
I would want in a man.

00:33.158 --> 00:35.409
-So that's what you talk
to your psychic about?

00:35.410 --> 00:36.702
- Mm-hmm.
- Hell no.

00:36.703 --> 00:40.080
-Your mother worries about you.
Who does this to?

00:40.081 --> 00:43.917
-Can't be mine.
What the fuck?

00:43.918 --> 00:46.086
- You have been through a lot.
- I have.

00:46.087 --> 00:49.757
-You cannot be afraid
of who you've loved,

00:49.758 --> 00:52.968
but now it's time to let it
rain, my little Stormey.

00:52.969 --> 00:54.386
-Gonna make me cry.

00:54.387 --> 00:57.765
The psychic is just kind of
giving me the okay to move on

00:57.766 --> 01:00.017
and I don't have to hide my --

01:00.018 --> 01:02.227
My personal life so much
anymore.

01:02.228 --> 01:04.813
I am a believer now.

01:04.814 --> 01:07.691
With Tonesa,
there was a social media post,

01:07.692 --> 01:10.527
and I just felt like a comment
was kind of subbing me.

01:10.528 --> 01:13.238
And so I just kind of
backed off from her.

01:13.239 --> 01:14.615
-Have you guys had that
conversation?

01:14.616 --> 01:16.742
- We haven't. Yeah. We haven't.
- Mm-hmm.

01:16.743 --> 01:22.790
-Okay. If Stormey is having
some issues with her "friend,"

01:22.791 --> 01:25.000
why she telling me about it
instead of telling Toni?

01:25.001 --> 01:28.587
That's kinda messy. Can't wait
to see how this turns out.

- Hi, honey.
- Give you a hug. Aww.

02:16.803 --> 02:19.388
-What's going down?
What's going on?

02:19.389 --> 02:20.931
-Nothing. Um...

02:20.932 --> 02:23.058
just chillin' really.
- Cool.

02:23.059 --> 02:26.520
I'm glad you wanted to join me,
agreed to join me.

02:26.521 --> 02:27.688
-Yes, yes.

02:27.689 --> 02:28.897
-I just wanted to,

02:28.898 --> 02:31.275
you know, get to know
you outside of the girls.

02:31.276 --> 02:34.194
I felt like, "I need
to talk to her alone."

02:34.195 --> 02:37.531
- Girl, we need shots, man.
- I know. What do you drink?

02:37.532 --> 02:38.491
-I'm drinking tequila,

02:38.492 --> 02:39.741
per usual.
- Oh, okay.

02:39.742 --> 02:41.702
- What you getting?
- I want some vodka.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.370
A vodka shot.
- Okay, cool.

02:43.371 --> 02:45.038
-When I met Mehgan
a few weeks ago,

02:45.039 --> 02:47.583
I remembered her from once
before.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.334
I met you before.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.837
We were invited
to a basketball game together.

02:51.838 --> 02:52.797
- With Polly?
- Yes.

02:52.798 --> 02:54.923
-Okay. I remember that night.

02:54.924 --> 02:56.466
-And she just been really cool,

02:56.467 --> 02:57.718
so I just want to get to know

02:57.719 --> 03:00.262
her a little more
to build a friendship.

03:00.263 --> 03:03.140
Maybe it's
a big sister-little sister.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.474
-Drink up.

03:04.475 --> 03:07.936
- Mm. There.
- What else you've been doing?

03:07.937 --> 03:11.773
-This weekend, I kind of felt
like a little lonely.

03:11.774 --> 03:14.318
I miss my boo, so --
-Boo?

03:14.319 --> 03:15.694
I need to hear something about
this boo,

03:15.695 --> 03:17.029
'cause I ain't got no boo,

03:17.030 --> 03:18.739
so I need to hear about
everybody else's boo.

03:18.740 --> 03:19.948
I need to live through y'all.

03:19.949 --> 03:21.575
- I miss him.
- Is he in Detroit?

03:21.576 --> 03:23.952
- Yeah, he's in Detroit.
- He's not gonna come visit us?

03:23.953 --> 03:26.496
All of us?
- Not right now.

03:26.497 --> 03:29.208
I want him too, but...
I probably have to

03:29.209 --> 03:30.459
go visit them first.

03:30.460 --> 03:31.877
-What is he --
-He's got a little situation.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.587
- A situation?
- Yeah.

03:33.588 --> 03:35.297
-What's his little situation?
Come on.

03:35.298 --> 03:36.340
We gotta get to know each other.

03:36.341 --> 03:37.883
What's the situation? Come on.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.886
-Well, I don't know if you heard
that I'm a part

03:40.887 --> 03:43.222
of this organization called BMF.

03:43.223 --> 03:46.725
So, Terry, I've been with him
since the '90s.

03:46.726 --> 03:49.061
He was one of the head guys.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.271
When Terry and I went to prison,

03:51.272 --> 03:52.898
we had a bad breakup.

03:52.899 --> 03:56.902
So he just came home in May,

03:56.903 --> 03:59.446
so they kind of got him
stipulated like

03:59.447 --> 04:01.990
he has to stay in Detroit
for a minute.

04:01.991 --> 04:05.619
Terry and I are trying
to rekindle our relationship,

04:05.620 --> 04:11.083
but he's thousands of miles away
and it's frickin' hard.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.502
It's been a long time
since we have been together,

04:13.503 --> 04:15.837
so it's like we just
starting all over.

04:15.838 --> 04:18.632
And starting all over
is like in a honeymoon.

04:18.633 --> 04:19.967
- Yeah.
- Yeah. You know.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.094
Like, "Ooh, I like him.
Like, I miss him." Right.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.096
- "I want him to be here."
- I don't know how

04:24.097 --> 04:25.681
it's going to be
like next month,

04:25.682 --> 04:27.224
but right now kind of like,
"Oh, wow."

04:27.225 --> 04:30.519
You know, I'm used to just
seeing him every day.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.521
-Toni,
y'all still be havin' sex?

04:32.522 --> 04:35.357
-What? What? You think I'm old
and I can't have sex?

04:35.358 --> 04:37.818
Yes!
- Okay, 'cause you know

04:37.819 --> 04:40.487
I don't be knowin' like...
- Lots of sex.

04:40.488 --> 04:41.655
I think she was throwing shade

04:41.656 --> 04:43.240
like I'm that damn old
or something.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.784
Yeah, I have sex,
and I'm gonna continue

04:45.785 --> 04:47.244
till probably the day I die.

04:47.245 --> 04:50.289
[Chuckles]
I told you he was affectionate.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.874
[Laughs]
Are you dating?

04:52.875 --> 04:56.586
- No, my phone is dry.
- Dry? Dry?

04:56.587 --> 04:59.006
-It's drier than
a Popeye's biscuit dry.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.341
- Oh, that's dry here.
- Period. Period.

05:01.342 --> 05:02.551
-That's dry.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.469
When's the last time you had
a relationship?

05:04.470 --> 05:06.471
-I've been single...
In January,

05:06.472 --> 05:08.849
it'll be three years.
- Really?

05:08.850 --> 05:09.933
-Yeah.

05:09.934 --> 05:11.935
I've been hurt so many times
in relationships.

05:11.936 --> 05:14.855
Like, I give all of me
and I never get that back.

05:14.856 --> 05:21.403
Like, I want more for myself,
and I'm not settling for less.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.947
-So what do you do now?
You don't have a boyfriend.

05:23.948 --> 05:26.325
-Right.
I got a whole box of toys.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.826
- Aww.
- It's really sad.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.870
-That's sad, though, 'cause --
-It is so sad.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.789
-'Cause it's not -- you know,
I need my whole body touched.

05:32.790 --> 05:34.458
-You know these men do not
deserve me, okay?

05:34.459 --> 05:36.501
So I'd rather just play with
my little toy, you know.

05:36.502 --> 05:39.338
Take the toy out the box,
put it back in the box.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.839
Ain't gonna give me no headache.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.466
- Go right to sleep.
- Go right to sleep.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.718
Ain't got to get up
and cook no breakfast,

05:44.719 --> 05:46.678
wash my drawers -- nothing.
- Nothing.

05:46.679 --> 05:49.348
-Cool. But I know it's still a
little --

05:49.349 --> 05:51.475
-It sucks.
[Laughs]

05:51.476 --> 05:53.935
-But, like, one of biggest fears
is getting older

05:53.936 --> 05:55.937
and being by myself.
So, like, I don't know.

05:55.938 --> 05:57.773
- That was my fear, too.
- Yeah.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.400
-So, that's why I'm --
I'm hoping

06:00.401 --> 06:02.402
that I'm just not
having a rebound,

06:02.403 --> 06:05.489
like, because I've been
by myself and lonely so long.

06:05.490 --> 06:08.116
That's what I wanted the psychic
to tell me.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.826
It's like I need
somebody to tell me.

06:09.827 --> 06:13.705
- What is making you doubt it?
- Our past.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.416
In our relationship,
he cheated on me a lot.

06:16.417 --> 06:19.419
Not a lot -- twice. And so...

06:19.420 --> 06:23.215
And I know you shouldn't
stay in your past, you know,

06:23.216 --> 06:25.008
but I keep thinking like,

06:25.009 --> 06:28.428
"Oh, shit. It's..."
- Like what if?

06:28.429 --> 06:29.638
- What if.
- Mm-hmm.

06:29.639 --> 06:33.058
-Rebuilding a relationship
can be very hard

06:33.059 --> 06:35.685
because our past is very hurtful
for both of us.

06:35.686 --> 06:38.188
So that's the stage
we're in now.

06:38.189 --> 06:41.650
Can I trust him that far away?

06:41.651 --> 06:43.276
I don't know.

06:43.277 --> 06:44.736
-So, um,
how close are you and Stormey?

06:44.737 --> 06:46.279
Because y'all really do have
a lot in common.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.782
Are y'all like super close?
Like sister-sister?

06:48.783 --> 06:51.701
- We're just cool.
- Y'all ever had any beef?

06:51.702 --> 06:53.203
-No, we haven't had no real
beef.

06:53.204 --> 06:55.747
- Oh, well, you know that--
- That's your "unh-unh."

06:55.748 --> 06:57.791
That's not what you heard.
- She said that y'all had like

06:57.792 --> 06:59.042
a little Internet beef.

06:59.043 --> 07:01.837
I was like, "Internet beef?"
- Who? Stormey?

07:01.838 --> 07:03.338
- Mm-hmm.
- Me and Stormey did?

07:03.339 --> 07:06.383
-What I heard was that
it was some subliminal shade

07:06.384 --> 07:10.512
being thrown via the Internet
on a Instagram post at her.

07:10.513 --> 07:14.182
-We hung out once, and then
there was a social media post.

07:14.183 --> 07:16.143
And I just felt like a post
or comment

07:16.144 --> 07:17.394
was kind of subbing me.

07:17.395 --> 07:20.856
And so I just kind of
backed off from her.

07:20.857 --> 07:24.401
-From me? Girl, bye.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.069
- Wait.
- Stormey? No.

07:26.070 --> 07:27.612
-So you ain't never threw
no shade at Stormey?

07:27.613 --> 07:30.657
- No! Why?
- I don't know.

07:30.658 --> 07:31.825
- No.
- I don't know.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.452
So, you don't know.
- I don't know.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.954
You know, so tell me --
What was the shade?

07:35.955 --> 07:38.707
-I don't know. She said --
-Why would I have to shade her?

07:38.708 --> 07:41.126
I'd get on the phone
and shade people.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.170
I ain't gonna do it
on the Internet.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.172
-I thought she would have
brought it up at psychic night.

07:45.173 --> 07:46.590
We was all there.
- Right.

07:46.591 --> 07:49.092
- She didn't say nothing.
- Well, I'll see her this week,

07:49.093 --> 07:51.136
so I'm gonna make sure
I bring it up

07:51.137 --> 07:53.472
because I don't like shit
floating around me

07:53.473 --> 07:55.182
and not telling me.
- I well, I mean,

07:55.183 --> 07:57.392
if she feels a type of way, I
feel like she should tell you.

07:57.393 --> 08:00.479
-Yeah, y'all just met.
I know her.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.564
Why wouldn't you tell me?

08:02.565 --> 08:05.192
I was shocked. Like,
what do we have a beef about?

08:05.193 --> 08:07.861
I couldn't imagine
doing anything to her, you know,

08:07.862 --> 08:10.697
and I was shocked that she
didn't come to me and tell me,

08:10.698 --> 08:12.157
but she would tell Mehgan.

08:12.158 --> 08:15.160
Felt like, "What is you telling
this Mehgan for?"

08:15.161 --> 08:17.412
I mean, you don't even know her.

08:17.413 --> 08:22.292
I felt like, "Damn, like,
now you shading me."

08:22.293 --> 08:26.129
She should've let me know that
before she told you.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.507
-I don't know, Stormey gives me
very, like...

08:28.508 --> 08:30.133
She just be very passive.
- Right.

08:30.134 --> 08:33.094
She's passive until she get --
It builds up

08:33.095 --> 08:34.888
and then it's like...
- But that's how some people

08:34.889 --> 08:36.348
deal with that problem
because, you know,

08:36.349 --> 08:37.891
at the end of the day,
she got to do it herself.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.476
You know what I'm saying?
- Right.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.102
-The pool party would be
a time to talk about it.

08:41.103 --> 08:43.313
-Stormey is having a pool party
at her home.

08:43.314 --> 08:45.315
-I'm going to have
a little spa day for us

08:45.316 --> 08:46.816
and I'm going to have
some body butter

08:46.817 --> 08:48.401
and I'm going to have some
good masseuses

08:48.402 --> 08:50.987
that's gonna rub it on us and
make us feel real special.

08:50.988 --> 08:54.115
Now I have to go to this party
knowing this Stormey

08:54.116 --> 08:57.077
has a beef with me,
and it's really pissing me off.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.621
I don't like being made
to feel stupid.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.957
So she has a lot
of explaining to do.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.708
Don't get me no liquor.
Don't give me shots.

09:03.709 --> 09:07.254
Don't give me anything, because
then I get a little aggressive.

09:07.255 --> 09:08.713
-I would just want to know
what was said.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.967
-I just want to address it.
I need to know.

I like them, too, Sandy.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.991

09:42.915 --> 09:45.750
About that move back, it's been
going well with the new girls

09:45.751 --> 09:47.168
that I was telling you
that I met

09:47.169 --> 09:48.503
and I brought over for drinks

09:48.504 --> 09:51.256
and we actually had a psychic
to come over.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.592
- Oh, how was that?
- That was interesting.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.427
You know, I've never sat
with a psychic before.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.638
He spoke on a lot of things
that just kind of made me

09:58.639 --> 10:01.433
just more aware
what I supposed to be doing.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.686
And he touched on something that
happened to me a while back.

10:04.687 --> 10:07.981
And coincidentally,
it happened just again.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.775
- What?
- You see that?

10:10.776 --> 10:13.612
- That's the paparazzi girl.
- Oh, hell no.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.155
-How do you even
find out where we are, though?

10:15.156 --> 10:17.324
Girl, we just need to leave,
'cause you know what?

10:17.325 --> 10:18.658
I can't even deal with that.

10:18.659 --> 10:20.076
It's really unrattling to me,

10:20.077 --> 10:25.040
because when I had my first
run in with the paparazzi,

10:25.041 --> 10:28.460
it turned my whole life
upside down.

10:28.461 --> 10:31.087
I'm still shook up about
the paparazzi incident.

10:31.088 --> 10:34.633
You know, I didn't expect to
to have that run in so soon

10:34.634 --> 10:36.593
as I returned back
to Los Angeles.

10:36.594 --> 10:40.430
So, yeah. I'm feeling
some kind of way about it.

10:40.431 --> 10:43.016
But when I ran into these
people again and I'm like,

10:43.017 --> 10:44.476
"Oh, God, here we go again.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.394
What they 'bout to say now?"
You know what I mean?

10:46.395 --> 10:47.812
And I just don't want
to deal with it.

10:47.813 --> 10:50.523
I want to keep my privacy
as much as possible.

10:50.524 --> 10:53.360
And that's why I'm just feeling
a little confused about am

10:53.361 --> 10:57.322
I making the right decision,
moving back, um, and, you know,

10:57.323 --> 10:59.449
is it going to be
a comfortable transition for me,

10:59.450 --> 11:00.992
which I'm sort of
struggling with?

11:00.993 --> 11:03.411
Three and a half years ago,
I was coming out of a restaurant

11:03.412 --> 11:05.372
and then one of the paparazzi
mentioned

11:05.373 --> 11:07.040
that, "Oh, that's
Suge Knight's baby mom."

11:07.041 --> 11:10.251
And then, of course, they went
into some questions about him

11:10.252 --> 11:11.795
and what they thought I had said

11:11.796 --> 11:15.548
had us at, like, odds with each
other, which is not true.

11:15.549 --> 11:19.219
And it all crumbled
within a matter of a week.

11:19.220 --> 11:22.555
It was heartbreaking to me.

11:22.556 --> 11:25.308
-I think you made a good choice
in moving back.

11:25.309 --> 11:28.645
We all together for the
first time in almost 30 years.

11:28.646 --> 11:30.772
- Yeah, I know.
- It's been a long time.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.774
Give it some thought,
and give it some time.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.776
-I know I need to give it
some more time.

11:34.777 --> 11:37.612
-It's just too soon.
Your mom is back.

11:37.613 --> 11:39.447
-I'm -- And I'm so happy
that you are back.

11:39.448 --> 11:41.825
I needed the support.
I needed you.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.493
I really needed you here.

11:43.494 --> 11:46.996
My mom's opinion weighs heavily
on my decision to stay.

11:46.997 --> 11:48.832
Her circumstances
doesn't allow her

11:48.833 --> 11:50.542
to travel
outside of state lines.

11:50.543 --> 11:54.546
So it's very selfish of me
to not be here for her.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.965
I can't live in fear,
so I know that I'm probably

11:56.966 --> 11:58.591
going to have
to go a tougher skin

11:58.592 --> 12:00.385
when it comes
to the paparazzi here.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.178
-You know, being incarcerated
all those years,

12:02.179 --> 12:06.433
and I just only imagine
you all being without a mom,

12:06.434 --> 12:07.851
you know, I know it was hard.

12:07.852 --> 12:11.479
So I'm here, you know,
if you ever want to talk and

12:11.480 --> 12:12.731
without the interruptions,

12:12.732 --> 12:14.649
that 15-minute phone call,
I'm here now.

12:14.650 --> 12:16.568
-I know that you are,
and a feels --

12:16.569 --> 12:17.777
That feels really great.

12:17.778 --> 12:20.572
So I also been
thinking about talking

12:20.573 --> 12:23.241
to someone professionally.
- We all need that.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.784
-I highly recommend it.

12:24.785 --> 12:27.078
-71 and I do that.
So, yeah.

12:27.079 --> 12:30.373
-I had to empty myself
out there with groups.

12:30.374 --> 12:31.750
I had to rehabilitate.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.836
And if I didn't, I wouldn't be
where I'm at right now.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.588
-I mean, it's definitely
going to be helpful.

12:36.589 --> 12:40.550
And I'm not ashamed to admit
that I can ask for help, too.

12:40.551 --> 12:43.052
[Laughter]
- Okay.

12:43.053 --> 12:46.055
-I know that my mom
was dealing with a lot of anger

12:46.056 --> 12:47.974
and feelings of betrayal.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.642
So by her going to a therapist,

12:49.643 --> 12:52.562
and I see the peace
that she has now in herself

12:52.563 --> 12:54.606
and that she's able
to forgive others,

12:54.607 --> 12:56.232
um, I think that's
a tremendous strength.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.902
I thought it was the best thing
that she could have done.

12:58.903 --> 13:00.862
And, um, it's something
that I had to work on

13:00.863 --> 13:02.447
because I would
hold grudges forever.

13:02.448 --> 13:06.451
And I'm looking for therapy
to get to some healing.

I can't wait to play it for you.

14:26.365 --> 14:28.157
I know that you know good music.

14:28.158 --> 14:30.034
You said you worked
in the entertainment industry.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.744
- Oh, yeah.
- What did you do?

14:31.745 --> 14:33.538
-Well, I actually used to work
for the Grammys,

14:33.539 --> 14:36.374
but prior to that,
I was Suge's ear.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.668
So, um...
- Right, like the whole A&R.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.295
-Yep. So he'll come home,
and play the music,

14:40.296 --> 14:41.963
and I tell him what I think.
- Really?

14:41.964 --> 14:43.506
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, that's lit.

14:43.507 --> 14:46.634
I've been working on new music
for a while now,

14:46.635 --> 14:48.094
but as of right now,

14:48.095 --> 14:51.848
no one has heard it other than
my manager and my vocal coach.

14:51.849 --> 14:54.684
So I really want to get
an outside opinion

14:54.685 --> 14:56.019
on my first single

14:56.020 --> 14:59.439
so I can see if it's really
as good as I think it is,

14:59.440 --> 15:02.025
or am I just hype of myself.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.235
Stormey was with Suge Knight
for years.

15:04.236 --> 15:06.237
I know she's been around

15:06.238 --> 15:10.450
most successful and talented

would want on this song,

15:13.621 --> 15:15.038
it'll definitely be Stormey.

When we had the wine night
and you were talking about

15:52.701 --> 15:55.411
how you had to leave L.A.
and you went to Vegas,

15:55.412 --> 15:58.706
You know, you ducked off and
focused on you and your family.

15:58.707 --> 16:00.333
-Had to get me right for
everybody else,

16:00.334 --> 16:02.961

definitely relate to that.

- Just have all the confidence

got a hit song on your hands.

16:11.387 --> 16:12.428

16:12.429 --> 16:14.263
-Yes, so just move like a star,

-Yo, beat that.
I appreciate that. For real.

16:21.021 --> 16:23.564
She like, "That's a hit.
That's a hit right there."

16:23.565 --> 16:25.024
I was like [gasps]

16:25.025 --> 16:26.651
You know,
I didn't expect her to say that.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.070
I just, you know, I'm just
thinking she was gonna be like,

16:29.071 --> 16:30.780
"Oh, it's good, it sounds good."

16:30.781 --> 16:32.657
But she like, "That's a hit."

16:32.658 --> 16:36.412
Yo, that made
my heart beat fast.

16:41.709 --> 16:44.127
My manager,
she's like, "La'Britney,

16:44.128 --> 16:46.629
I need you to have the song
mixed and mastered,

16:46.630 --> 16:49.465
I need you to have
your listening party

16:49.466 --> 16:51.592
properly planned out,
the location."

16:51.593 --> 16:54.137
She's gave me three weeks
to do all of these things

16:54.138 --> 16:55.680
and pull all of the stuff
together.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.265
-And I think that
you could do it.

16:57.266 --> 17:01.102
-I know I can. What I -- What
I need to do is find a house.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.271
I'm still trying
to find a house.

17:03.272 --> 17:05.189
The pressures of me just like

17:05.190 --> 17:07.525
really trying to solidify
a place to live,

17:07.526 --> 17:09.318
I can't wait to bring
the boys out here.

17:09.319 --> 17:13.781
It's been like 10 days
since I've physically seen them.

17:13.782 --> 17:15.283
- Oh, you missed them.
- Yeah, I like to see they faces.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.410
I like to rub my lips
on they cheeks.

17:17.411 --> 17:22.623
So trying to just balance
like real life, career life,

17:22.624 --> 17:25.376
and time is, like, flying by.

17:25.377 --> 17:28.629
-Yeah, I see. Ooh.
That's a lot of pressure.

17:28.630 --> 17:31.549
-Yeah. Having a solid foundation
for me and my family

17:31.550 --> 17:33.760
is more important
than anything else.

17:33.761 --> 17:36.971
So, like, that's fucking me up
from being able to really focus

17:36.972 --> 17:38.056
on anything else.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.432
It's just, like, stressful.

17:39.433 --> 17:42.518
I did not think that
it will be this complicated.

17:42.519 --> 17:44.479
- I have an idea for you.
- Okay.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.773
-We can do a listening party
at my house if you want.

17:46.774 --> 17:49.692
-Hell yeah, I want to have to
listening party at your house.

17:49.693 --> 17:51.069
Your house bomb.
- [Laughs]

17:51.070 --> 17:52.779
-I'm trying to get a crib
like your crib out here.

17:52.780 --> 17:55.198
So I would love to.
I think that'd be so cool.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.283
-And we can just have it like
a small -- a small,

17:57.284 --> 17:58.659
intimate type of setting.
- Okay.

17:58.660 --> 18:01.204
- But we're inviting key people.
- The whole team.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.413
-Exactly. Key people.

18:02.414 --> 18:04.123
-When Stormey tells me
I can use her crib

18:04.124 --> 18:07.627
for my listening party,
I'm like [exhales sharply]

18:07.628 --> 18:08.795
"Wow," you know?

18:08.796 --> 18:10.421
Like Stormey
has this big, beautiful house.

18:10.422 --> 18:12.924
I'm just like, "Yo, that real
real of you, you know?"

18:12.925 --> 18:15.468
I really appreciate
that kind of love.

18:15.469 --> 18:18.429
So Mehgan the other day
was pissed at the psychic.

18:18.430 --> 18:19.847
- Yeah, she was.
- She was like,

18:19.848 --> 18:22.600
"I don't know what ancestors'
he was talking to,

18:22.601 --> 18:23.976
but they must be dead ancestors

18:23.977 --> 18:26.062
because he ain't readin'
my horoscope right at all."

18:26.063 --> 18:28.022
-But I think he kind of hit
the nail on the head

18:28.023 --> 18:30.566
with something with her because
we've mentioned her mother.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.819
She was just -- immediately
just rejected that.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.780
And, you know,
I'm a mother and -- and I know

18:35.781 --> 18:37.198
no mothers
are perfect out there.

18:37.199 --> 18:38.783
And I know when people
don't like their mothers,

18:38.784 --> 18:39.992
that kind of bothers me
because I'm like,

18:39.993 --> 18:41.327
"What kind of person are you?"

18:41.328 --> 18:42.703
The fact that she wasn't open

18:42.704 --> 18:44.789
to that
was a little concerning to me.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.625
She's not going to have
a good relationship with a man

18:47.626 --> 18:49.919
until she's able to learn
how to forgive her mama.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.629
- Mm. Mm.
- Like, she's putting on

18:51.630 --> 18:53.256
this front that she's...
- Front -- the makeup,

18:53.257 --> 18:54.924
[indistinct]
- all together,

18:54.925 --> 18:56.259
but yet deep down inside,

18:56.260 --> 18:58.427
I think she's dealing
with some -- some real issue.

18:58.428 --> 18:59.887
-Yeah, I think so, too.

18:59.888 --> 19:02.056
-And that's what I like
to share with her

19:02.057 --> 19:03.516
is I've gone through that.

19:03.517 --> 19:05.852
I've gone through shame,
being humiliated

19:05.853 --> 19:09.856
and I've worked through it,
and she could get through it.

19:09.857 --> 19:12.358
You know, I do feel
that Mehgan has some issues

19:12.359 --> 19:14.152
with her mother
and forgiveness, and, yeah,

19:14.153 --> 19:17.071
you may have been hurting
in that situation,

19:17.072 --> 19:19.031
but you don't know
what that other person

19:19.032 --> 19:20.700
may have been
going through as well.

19:20.701 --> 19:24.203
I do feel that if she's not able
to reconcile with her mother

19:24.204 --> 19:25.705
or find some sort of peace,

19:25.706 --> 19:27.707
it will affect
other relationships.

19:27.708 --> 19:32.044
Now, speaking of real, 'cause
I like to keep things real...

19:32.045 --> 19:33.921
- Uh-huh.
- now, I know

19:33.922 --> 19:36.299
you and Toni have, um,
a relationship.

19:36.300 --> 19:39.177
I'm sort of new to her,
but we did hang out a while

19:39.178 --> 19:41.846
and, um, I just felt like
I had caught of beat,

19:41.847 --> 19:43.973
and I told Mehgan
I may have assumed,

19:43.974 --> 19:48.060
but I had saw a post,
and I felt like it was a sub.

19:48.061 --> 19:49.145
- From Toni?
- Yeah.

19:49.146 --> 19:50.771
- What did it say?
- And it said,

19:50.772 --> 19:53.941
"I don't want nobody or somebody
riding my coattail."

19:53.942 --> 19:55.693
And I was -- I don't know.

19:55.694 --> 19:58.196
Like I said, I was in my
feelings at that time,

19:58.197 --> 20:00.990
but I felt -- I felt like
I caught a beat from it,

20:00.991 --> 20:03.534
and I kind of backed off
on Toni.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.203
I feel like I want
to talk to her about it

20:05.204 --> 20:07.622
just to make sure that we
don't have nothing there,

20:07.623 --> 20:10.082
you know what I mean, and that
is clear, you know what I mean?

20:10.083 --> 20:12.793
And -- And if I was wrong
about my assumption,

20:12.794 --> 20:16.255
I'm woman enough to admit it.
- She's pretty direct, you know?

20:16.256 --> 20:18.591
So I feel like if she felt like

20:18.592 --> 20:20.801
that about you,
she'll let you know.

20:20.802 --> 20:22.762
- Yeah.
- Toni and Stormey

20:22.763 --> 20:24.013
do have a history.

20:24.014 --> 20:26.891
They have been friends
for a while now.

20:26.892 --> 20:30.144
It's possible --
Maybe Toni was mad at Stormey

20:30.145 --> 20:31.854
and Stormey did some shit to her
to make her

20:31.855 --> 20:34.232
shade her on the Internet.
Who knows?

20:34.233 --> 20:36.359

they could come together

20:36.360 --> 20:37.610

- But I don't want that.

26:18.910 --> 26:20.953
I want to still have fun and
build with my man.

26:20.954 --> 26:22.663
I want to build.
- You want him to be active.

26:22.664 --> 26:25.541
-Active.
I need a person that values me.

26:25.542 --> 26:28.002
- Okay.
- My person is at least six feet.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.420
- How tall are you?
- I'm 5'5".

26:29.421 --> 26:31.755
I like -- I'm a big girl.
For my size, I'm thick.

26:31.756 --> 26:33.215
I need somebody
to make me feel like I'm small.

26:33.216 --> 26:34.800
-Six feet though?
'Cause you know the average

26:34.801 --> 26:37.052
height for a man is like 5'8".
- Okay, well, average

26:37.053 --> 26:39.638
ain't for me, sis, period.
- [Laughs]

26:39.639 --> 26:41.098
Mehgan is reading me her list.

26:41.099 --> 26:43.267
I feel like a lot of the things
that she were naming,

26:43.268 --> 26:45.185
they were just like
surface level.

26:45.186 --> 26:49.064
But, like, where are the most
important characteristics

26:49.065 --> 26:51.734
and traits
that we need to see in our men?

26:51.735 --> 26:55.404
What's going to really make
a relationship successful

26:55.405 --> 26:57.656
isn't a man's height,
you feel me?

26:57.657 --> 27:00.367
Like, what is his heart like?

27:00.368 --> 27:01.952
-My person has no other
children.

27:01.953 --> 27:04.246
My person is --
-Okay, hold on. Hold on.

27:04.247 --> 27:07.166
- Negative Nancy!
- But I have to -- No,

27:07.167 --> 27:08.626
because I have children.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.420
So, like, if people counted me
out because I have children

27:11.421 --> 27:13.088
then you fucking losing.
Let me tell you something.

27:13.089 --> 27:16.342
So my experience with men
who have children,

27:16.343 --> 27:17.760
like, if they are good fathers,

27:17.761 --> 27:21.263
they actually tend to be more
responsible, more mature.

27:21.264 --> 27:23.682
Because when you have children,
you know what I'm saying?

27:23.683 --> 27:24.767
Your life changes.

27:24.768 --> 27:27.019
-I'm the oldest of seven,
and my dad

27:27.020 --> 27:29.521
has seven kids
by seven different women.

27:29.522 --> 27:31.857
-Okay, but what if your man --
-But let me tell you,

27:31.858 --> 27:36.278
it's been hard for me to have
relationships with my siblings

27:36.279 --> 27:38.155
because the baby mamas
is bitter.

27:38.156 --> 27:39.657
- Yeah.
- It's too much.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.283
I don't want my kids to have
to share a daddy with nobody.

27:41.284 --> 27:42.826
That's your daddy, period.
- Okay. Okay.

27:42.827 --> 27:45.788
I mean, this your man, not mine.
- Yeah, 'cause he coming.

27:45.789 --> 27:48.832
No other children,
My person has nice hair.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.793
Not no taco meat.

27:50.794 --> 27:53.921
Taco meat hair
is like hair that looks like

27:53.922 --> 27:56.548
shriveled-up ground beef.

27:56.549 --> 27:58.300
[Laughs] I'm sorry, sis.

27:58.301 --> 28:01.845
[Laughs] Period.

28:01.846 --> 28:03.514
-I mean, okay, come on, sis.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.307
Like, I know
you want what you want,

28:05.308 --> 28:08.310
but, like, what happens
if a man comes along

28:08.311 --> 28:10.938
and he treats you like the queen
that you are,

28:10.939 --> 28:12.231
but he got a little taco meat?

28:12.232 --> 28:13.941
You're going
to get rid of him for that?

28:13.942 --> 28:16.193
You know, I think not.

28:16.194 --> 28:18.904
-My person doesn't mind showing
me off and being proud of me

28:18.905 --> 28:20.781
because you know you ain't got
to keep me under the rug,

28:20.782 --> 28:22.032
period.
- Okay.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.534
-My person wants kids.

28:23.535 --> 28:24.993
-He wants kids, can't have kids.

28:24.994 --> 28:26.370
-He can't have kids
but want to have some.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.080
-That's some bullshit
right there.

28:28.081 --> 28:30.040
-What? What if he's just like me
and has just not found

28:30.041 --> 28:31.583
the right baby mama?
- But you might

28:31.584 --> 28:34.586
miss out on people.
- I'm just -- They're not for me.

28:34.587 --> 28:36.255
That's how I feel, though.
I feel like

28:36.256 --> 28:38.173
this is the list that I want
and this is what I want.

28:38.174 --> 28:40.008
And like I said,
I do believe in manifestation.

28:40.009 --> 28:41.260
You know, I feel like I deserve

28:41.261 --> 28:42.803
and I can have anything
that I want.

28:42.804 --> 28:45.931
-You be so particular,
like, with people,

28:45.932 --> 28:48.058
I don't think
that that's realistic.

28:48.059 --> 28:49.309
-Maybe I live in la la land,
sis,

28:49.310 --> 28:50.602
but I feel like my man coming.

28:50.603 --> 28:52.312
La'Britney
is giving me these crazy looks

28:52.313 --> 28:55.441
and thinks that my list
is ridiculous and outrageous,

28:55.442 --> 28:59.153
but it just makes me feel
like La'Britney may be willing

28:59.154 --> 29:04.116
to lower her standards for
a man, but I'm not doing it.

29:04.117 --> 29:06.702
-But anyway.
Listen, one of my friends,

29:06.703 --> 29:08.912
she just went to see
this dating expert.

29:08.913 --> 29:12.583
And sis has been in love
ever since.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.960
She just got proposed to,
about to get married. Yes.

29:14.961 --> 29:16.503
- How long has it been?
- It's been like

29:16.504 --> 29:19.715
only three months.
- To her perfect man.

29:19.716 --> 29:21.300
-I don't know if her list
was like yours,

29:21.301 --> 29:23.886
but she loves him, though,
and he loves her.

29:23.887 --> 29:25.471
And that's all that matters.

29:25.472 --> 29:28.766
I want to set you guys up.
- Okay, cool.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.267
- You down?
- I would be open to it,

29:30.268 --> 29:32.019
but I'm gonna hand her
this list, and she gonna have to

29:32.020 --> 29:34.271
find the person on the list
or it's not going down, period.

29:34.272 --> 29:36.231
-Listen, let's speak this list
into existence.

29:36.232 --> 29:37.900
-This list gonna happen period.
I'm telling you.

29:37.901 --> 29:39.568
I'm gonna be like,
"Miss Dating Match Person,

29:39.569 --> 29:43.822
this is who I want. Go get him."
- Or her job is gonna be to

29:43.823 --> 29:47.284
help you really find the real

29:47.285 --> 29:48.869
because I don't think
that's the real.

29:48.870 --> 29:50.245
- It's the real.
- A lot of it

29:50.246 --> 29:52.039
is too, like, shallow.
- When it comes to my man,

29:52.040 --> 29:53.999
I could be whoever I want to be
because he's the one

29:54.000 --> 29:55.834
who are going to be hitting
from the back at night.

29:55.835 --> 29:57.169
Okay?
- [Laughs]

29:57.170 --> 29:59.421
-He gonna be the one digging it
out at night, okay,

29:59.422 --> 30:01.173
and I have to be attracted
to the person

30:01.174 --> 30:02.966
that's on top of me, sis,
period.

30:02.967 --> 30:04.051
-Look, you right.

30:04.052 --> 30:05.594
Cheers.
- Cheers.

30:05.595 --> 30:06.804

- Destinee. Nice to meet you.
- You as well.

30:40.213 --> 30:42.422
-Okay, so this is the thing.
I've been working on

30:42.423 --> 30:43.841
my line for the next season,

30:43.842 --> 30:47.427
and I want to do
like a preseason fashion show.

30:47.428 --> 30:48.929
I just met this new group
of girls

30:48.930 --> 30:51.598
'cause y'all know I ain't got no
friends in L.A. period, right?

30:51.599 --> 30:54.935
They're about 10 to 15 years
older than me, right?

30:54.936 --> 30:56.395
But they're all entrepreneurs,

30:56.396 --> 30:59.022
and I want to -- like,
I want to include them.

30:59.023 --> 31:02.401
So this is what I have so far
as far as ideas.

31:02.402 --> 31:05.070
These are like the new trends
of the season.

31:05.071 --> 31:08.198
So, you know, I got
a little old scooter up here

31:08.199 --> 31:10.617
and a little young fatty
down here, right?

31:10.618 --> 31:11.827
- Okay.
- Yeah.

31:11.828 --> 31:12.953
-So I was going to go

31:12.954 --> 31:16.123
with these three
for the three ladies.

31:16.124 --> 31:17.958
So I've been designing swimwear
for three years,

31:17.959 --> 31:19.418
and I'm very passionate
about it.

31:19.419 --> 31:21.962
These ladies probably think
I'm just a pretty face

31:21.963 --> 31:23.463
and I have nothing to offer,

31:23.464 --> 31:25.632
but I'm serious about what I do
and I want to show them

31:25.633 --> 31:27.426
that there's more to me
than meets the eye.

31:27.427 --> 31:29.011
This will go on for Queen T.

31:29.012 --> 31:31.096
She's older, but she's really
cute, nice body.

31:31.097 --> 31:33.599
Every time we link up,
she'd be dressed for the nines.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.392
So I feel like this
one would be cute for her.

31:35.393 --> 31:36.685
She's very fashionable.

31:36.686 --> 31:37.978
And then we have this one
for Miss Stormey.

31:37.979 --> 31:39.855
She'll be
more conservative girl.

31:39.856 --> 31:42.316
You know, she don't drink
or smoke or do nothing fun,

31:42.317 --> 31:43.942
so, you know, all she --
I don't know if she

31:43.943 --> 31:45.945
gonna be comfortable showing a
little belly.

31:47.071 --> 31:49.698
Oh, she's not a wife, sis.
She a baby mama.

31:49.699 --> 31:51.783
So, she Suge Knight baby mama.

31:51.784 --> 31:55.203
Tragic, but she's cool sometimes
or whatever because, like,

31:55.204 --> 31:56.830
she'll be playing
Miss Goody Two Shoes

31:56.831 --> 31:58.373
and I'm just like, "Sis,

31:58.374 --> 32:01.376
like, you was 'married'
to Suge Knight.

32:01.377 --> 32:02.920
Like, you ain't
Miss Goody Two Shoes."

32:02.921 --> 32:04.588
So we're going to do this
one for Goody Two Shoes.

32:04.589 --> 32:05.923
- Okay.
- Okay, cool.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.300
When I just met Stormey,
like, she was giving me

32:08.301 --> 32:12.304
Miss Perfect vibes, Skittles
and rainbows and all that.

32:12.305 --> 32:15.807
And then I get to talking to her
and she has beef with Miss T.

32:15.808 --> 32:17.559
Now that Toni's going to
ask her about it,

32:17.560 --> 32:20.103
we're going to see what
type of person she really is.

32:20.104 --> 32:21.897
And then for this one,
this is La'Britney.

32:21.898 --> 32:25.275
She 31, nice body,
you know, young and sexy.

32:25.276 --> 32:27.361
So, you think this is cool,
right?

32:27.362 --> 32:29.237
Okay, so these three are a go.
- Okay.

32:29.238 --> 32:31.323
-So, we need to pick out
five more swimsuits

32:31.324 --> 32:33.450
and then we need to pick out
a color scheme

32:33.451 --> 32:35.077
and then we need to pick
out a theme.

32:35.078 --> 32:37.245
-I say do like
a "jungle fever" collection.

32:37.246 --> 32:39.831
Like...
- That would be cute.

32:39.832 --> 32:41.583
It's very important for this
fashion show to go

32:41.584 --> 32:44.252
smoothly for me because
I'm tired of selling online.

32:44.253 --> 32:46.213
Like, I really,
really want to get into

32:46.214 --> 32:47.547
a high-end retail store.

32:47.548 --> 32:51.009
So jungle fever seems to be
the best idea for me.

32:51.010 --> 32:52.886
I want it to be very expensive.

32:52.887 --> 32:55.180
Like, I want it
to be on the yacht.

32:55.181 --> 32:56.473
-Yeah, so I would say, like,

32:56.474 --> 32:58.058
add, like, dainty stuff
onto the swimsuit,

32:58.059 --> 33:00.185
like gold hardware and make it
very exquisite and sexy.

33:00.186 --> 33:02.479
-Very -- Very. Yeah, I agree.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.481
Right. So that's what I want.
- Hell yeah.

33:04.482 --> 33:06.233
-Okay, y'all, well,
this has been fun.

33:06.234 --> 33:07.484
- Yeah.
- Okay.

33:07.485 --> 33:09.653
- Bye, y'all. Thanks for coming.
- Bye. Take care.

you were really disrespectful.
And I also felt, like, attacked.
