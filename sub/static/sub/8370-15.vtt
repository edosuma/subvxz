01:04.565 --> 01:06.695
_

01:14.709 --> 01:17.149
- Lion Guard!
- Lion Guard!

01:17.184 --> 01:18.275
This way, everyone!

01:22.650 --> 01:24.534
You're here!
Thank goodness!

01:24.569 --> 01:26.419
We came as soon as we could.

01:26.421 --> 01:28.123
What's the kerbubble?

01:28.158 --> 01:30.708
Our den! It's full of...

01:30.743 --> 01:33.259
- Hyenas!
- Hyenas again?

01:33.261 --> 01:37.063
We've had to chase them out of the
Pride Lands every night this week!

01:37.098 --> 01:41.538
I know one thing that'll scare them
away from the aardvarks' den for good.

01:41.573 --> 01:43.306
Lion Guard, follow me!

01:49.577 --> 01:51.407
There they are!

01:51.412 --> 01:52.912
I see 'em...

01:52.914 --> 01:54.814
Everyone, stay behind me.

01:56.584 --> 02:00.014
Hey! I told you before,
and I meant it.

02:00.021 --> 02:04.431
Get out of
the Pride Lands!

02:09.764 --> 02:11.694
And stay out.

02:13.734 --> 02:17.574
Oh, yeah! Things
have been pretty quiet since

02:17.575 --> 02:20.980
we chased those hyenas
off the other night, huh?

02:21.015 --> 02:23.109
Well, Kion did
most of the work.

02:23.144 --> 02:26.274
Yeah, but we had his back!

02:27.548 --> 02:28.781
Mmm!

02:28.816 --> 02:30.546
Ugh. Bunga!

02:30.551 --> 02:33.721
- What?
- Please tell me you're done eating.

02:33.756 --> 02:36.189
Not even close!

02:36.224 --> 02:39.724
Besides, haven't you noticed?

02:39.727 --> 02:42.057
There are termites everywhere!

02:43.731 --> 02:45.932
Uh, yeah.

02:45.967 --> 02:49.397
No kidding.
Here, Bunga. All yours.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.763
Mmm, termites on a stick!

02:51.772 --> 02:53.602
Thanks, Kion!

02:53.608 --> 02:55.878
Mmm!

02:56.410 --> 02:57.610
Really?

02:57.645 --> 02:59.245
Everyone!
Everyone!

02:59.247 --> 03:00.379
What is it, Ono?

03:00.414 --> 03:02.814
We've got an emergency
at Mekundu Cliffs!

03:02.817 --> 03:04.947
A big hollow tree is falling apart!

03:04.952 --> 03:09.522
A tree falling apart?
That's not really an emergency.

03:09.524 --> 03:12.854
Yes, it is! It's the tree
where the Mekundu Bats live!

03:12.860 --> 03:14.260
They're asleep inside!

03:14.295 --> 03:17.966
- Why didn't you wake them up?
- I would, but, you know...

03:18.001 --> 03:20.035
...they're bats.

03:20.070 --> 03:21.534
You're afraid of bats?

03:21.536 --> 03:24.535
You're the bravest.
I'm the keenest of sight. Okay?

03:24.570 --> 03:27.535
You were right to get us, Ono.
Come on, everybody.

03:27.542 --> 03:29.272
To the Pride Lands' end...

03:29.277 --> 03:31.077
<i>...Lion Guard defend!</i>

03:33.147 --> 03:34.877
One second!

03:34.882 --> 03:37.512
...Lion Guard defend!

03:39.554 --> 03:41.284
What's the fastest way, Ono?

03:44.458 --> 03:47.130
Across that fallen tree
and over the ravine!

03:47.165 --> 03:48.428
Got it!

03:57.572 --> 03:59.202
<i> Heyvi kabisa!</i>

03:59.207 --> 04:02.807
I don't get it. That tree's
held all of us before.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.680
Even Beshte.
What happened?

04:04.715 --> 04:06.312
Maybe it just got old.

04:06.347 --> 04:09.177
Whatever it was,
we can talk about it later.

04:09.183 --> 04:11.813
We still have to help
the Mekundu bats!

04:11.819 --> 04:12.889
Come on!

04:13.988 --> 04:15.818
There it is!
The hollow tree!

04:18.392 --> 04:19.452
Whoa!

04:22.530 --> 04:26.070
The whole thing's coming down!
We gotta wake up the bats!

04:26.105 --> 04:28.197
<i>Wake up! Get up!
Wake up, guys! Wake up, bats!</i>

04:28.202 --> 04:31.667
- Hey, bats!
- Are they coming out?

04:31.672 --> 04:33.402
I don't hear anything.

04:37.845 --> 04:40.845
<i>I'm going in!
Zuka Zama!</i>

04:40.848 --> 04:44.248
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

04:48.356 --> 04:50.126
Oh, no!

04:52.193 --> 04:54.023
- Are they gone?
- They're gone.

04:54.028 --> 04:55.528
Bunga?

04:55.529 --> 04:56.729
Uh-oh! Look out!

04:56.731 --> 04:57.801
Oh, no!

04:58.599 --> 04:59.669
Bunga!

05:01.902 --> 05:03.662
Somebody call me?

05:05.306 --> 05:09.036
I am not okay with all
the termites around here.

05:09.043 --> 05:11.603
You're right.
There's a lot of them.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.942
I've never seen
so many termites.

05:13.948 --> 05:15.681
They ate through
the whole tree.

05:15.716 --> 05:18.216
Maybe they ate through
the tree bridge, too.

05:18.219 --> 05:20.019
I bet that's why it collapsed!

05:20.054 --> 05:22.784
That certainly makes sense.
Termites eat wood.

05:22.790 --> 05:25.374
So too many termites
would eat too much wood.

05:25.409 --> 05:27.959
But we've always had termites
in the Pride Lands.

05:27.962 --> 05:29.392
Why are there too many now?

05:29.397 --> 05:32.067
Hey! Just because
there are a lot of termites,

05:32.102 --> 05:33.636
it doesn't mean
there's too many.

05:33.671 --> 05:34.994
Huh?

05:40.608 --> 05:42.678
Okay. There may be
a few too many.

05:42.713 --> 05:44.907
We have to tell my dad.

05:44.912 --> 05:47.841
Let me guess.
You're here to tell me that

05:47.842 --> 05:50.590
there are too many
termites in the Pride Lands?

05:50.625 --> 05:52.184
Um, yeah.

05:52.186 --> 05:56.156
The thing is, we don't know
why there are so many termites.

05:56.157 --> 05:59.857
Hmm. Maybe we should
ask the aardwolves.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.960
- Aardwolves?
- That's right.

06:01.962 --> 06:04.822
They're the Pride Lands'
termite experts.

06:04.832 --> 06:07.762
I've heard of aardwolves,
but I've never seen one.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.968
I'm not surprised.
They're very shy.

06:09.970 --> 06:13.110
They only come out at night, and
pretty much keep to themselves.

06:13.145 --> 06:17.447
But they love to eat termites.
Even more than you do!

06:17.482 --> 06:20.281
- Not possible!
- So the aardwolves keep

06:20.282 --> 06:23.390
the Pride Lands' termites under control?

06:23.425 --> 06:26.314
That's right.
At least, until now.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.254
I sure hope
nothing happened to them.

06:28.289 --> 06:32.229
Yeah. We better talk to the
aardwolves and make sure they're okay.

06:32.264 --> 06:34.956
- Where do they live?
- Well, they tend to roam around.

06:34.962 --> 06:38.922
But their favorite places to
sleep are empty aardvark dens.

06:40.201 --> 06:42.183
Empty aardvark dens?

06:42.218 --> 06:45.115
Ha! That's funny. We
just chased hyenas out

06:45.116 --> 06:47.881
of an empty aardvark
den a couple days ago!

06:47.916 --> 06:52.645
Uh, Dad? What exactly
do aardwolves look like?

06:52.646 --> 06:55.246
Well, they actually look
a lot like hyenas.

06:56.851 --> 06:58.884
I was afraid you'd say that.

06:58.919 --> 07:03.629
Dad, I... I think I kicked the
aardwolves out of the Pride Lands.

07:04.258 --> 07:05.358
It was a mistake.

07:05.359 --> 07:07.108
I thought they were hyenas.

07:07.143 --> 07:08.857
We all did.
I still do!

07:08.863 --> 07:10.193
Thanks, guys.

07:10.197 --> 07:12.597
But I'm the one who used
the Roar on them.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.700
You Roared at the aardwolves?

07:15.703 --> 07:17.663
Well, that explain
the termites.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.635
I'm sorry, Dad.

07:21.008 --> 07:23.508
Kion, you've made a mistake.

07:23.511 --> 07:24.744
We all do.

07:24.779 --> 07:25.909
But it's what you do

07:25.913 --> 07:27.213
to correct your mistakes

07:27.214 --> 07:28.714
that really counts.

07:28.716 --> 07:29.916
Thanks, Dad.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.387
We're gonna make things right.

07:31.422 --> 07:32.715
I promise!

07:32.720 --> 07:35.260
Lion Guard, we're gonna find
those aardwolves,

07:35.295 --> 07:37.426
and bring them back
to the Pride Lands!

07:41.362 --> 07:46.692
Your Roar sure knocked those
aardwolves a long way into the Outlands.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.961
Don't rub it in.
I'm just glad we got their

07:49.962 --> 07:53.033
scent from the aardvark
dens so we can track them.

07:53.040 --> 07:56.110
I'm glad I had a termite
snack before we left.

07:56.145 --> 07:57.910
This place has none.

07:57.945 --> 08:01.375
Those poor aardwolves must be
gettin' awful hungry.

08:01.382 --> 08:04.882
As soon as we get them back home,
they'll have plenty of termites to eat!

08:05.986 --> 08:07.916
Do you smell that?

08:09.056 --> 08:10.486
It's the aardwolves' scent.

08:10.491 --> 08:12.131
And it's getting stronger.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.265
I just saw The Lion Guard!

08:19.300 --> 08:20.933
They followed us
into the Outlands!

08:20.968 --> 08:23.838
What are they doing out here?

08:23.873 --> 08:25.508
You think they're still after us?

08:25.543 --> 08:26.836
The Lion Guard?

08:26.841 --> 08:28.374
Why would they be after us?

08:28.409 --> 08:30.909
They already chased us
out of the Pride Lands.

08:30.911 --> 08:34.251
Into the
termite-forsaken Outlands.

08:34.285 --> 08:35.278
Yes.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.442
Yes! Of course!

08:37.451 --> 08:39.921
The Lion Guard can't be
looking for us.

08:39.956 --> 08:41.820
They're just passing by!

08:47.361 --> 08:49.764
So when we find the
aardwolves, what's the plan?

08:49.799 --> 08:52.167
- Sneak up on 'em?
- Surround them?

08:52.202 --> 08:56.939
- Still think they're just passing by?
- But why? Why?!

08:58.272 --> 09:01.472
Oh, look!
Is that a bug?

09:01.475 --> 09:04.805
Pfft! All this tracking's
taking too long.

09:04.812 --> 09:07.442
I'm goin' up and over.

09:07.448 --> 09:09.018
<i> Zuka Zama!</i>

09:11.519 --> 09:13.677
It's not like you'd sneak up on somebody

09:13.678 --> 09:15.619
and surround them just to say hello.

09:15.623 --> 09:17.283
Am I right?

09:18.893 --> 09:20.293
Oh, hello!

09:23.898 --> 09:26.468
I found 'em!
They're goin' that way!

09:26.503 --> 09:27.797
But why are they running away?

09:27.801 --> 09:30.096
I don't know, Beshte.
All I know is that we've

09:30.097 --> 09:32.537
gotta convince 'em to come
back to the Pride Lands!

09:32.540 --> 09:33.939
Now come on!

09:33.974 --> 09:37.204
- Aardwolves!
<i>- Aardwolves! Aardwolves!</i>

09:39.046 --> 09:41.076
It really is the Lion Guard!

09:41.081 --> 09:43.821
Why didn't somebody
say something?

09:43.856 --> 09:46.687
They're coming
after us!

09:46.722 --> 09:48.721
Run faster!

09:48.756 --> 09:50.990
Wow. They're pretty fast.

09:51.025 --> 09:53.085
<i>Oh, you want fast?
Huwezi!</i>

09:57.031 --> 09:58.964
Listen up!
We're the Lion Guard!

09:58.999 --> 10:01.655
We're only here to... Whoa.

10:04.505 --> 10:07.356
- You okay?
- They didn't stop.

10:07.391 --> 10:10.176
Yeah, we noticed.
That was weird.

10:10.177 --> 10:13.045
Wait.
They're afraid of us!

10:13.047 --> 10:17.049
- Afraid of us?
- Well, I did use the Roar on them.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.184
Maybe they think
we're out to get them.

10:19.186 --> 10:21.356
You mean they think
we're the bad guys?

10:21.391 --> 10:22.615
But we're the Lion Guard.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.083
We can't be the bad guys.

10:24.091 --> 10:26.031
And you didn't mean
to Roar at them.

10:26.066 --> 10:27.660
It was an honest mistake.

10:27.695 --> 10:30.025
Yeah, but they don't know that.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.730
So we've gotta convince
them we're the good guys.

10:32.733 --> 10:35.363
Of course, we've gotta
find them again first.

10:35.369 --> 10:37.139
Look! I see one of
them right there!

10:41.141 --> 10:42.675
<i>Hapana.</i>

10:42.710 --> 10:45.110
Guys! He's running
right towards a cliff!

10:45.112 --> 10:46.712
Leave this one to me!

10:46.714 --> 10:47.974
<i> Zuka Zama!</i>

10:58.795 --> 11:00.196
Get off me.

11:00.231 --> 11:01.560
Get off of me!

11:01.595 --> 11:03.925
What do you think you're doing?

11:03.931 --> 11:08.671
Uhh, maybe a little something
like saving your life!

11:08.706 --> 11:09.899
What?

11:10.904 --> 11:12.404
Oh.

11:12.406 --> 11:14.376
Uh, in that case, thanks.

11:15.576 --> 11:17.710
So now what?

11:17.745 --> 11:20.845
You've already kicked me and the
others out of the Pride Lands!

11:20.848 --> 11:23.082
Where do you want
us to go now?

11:23.117 --> 11:25.947
We want you to come
back to the Pride Lands!

11:25.953 --> 11:28.874
You want us to go back?
Wouldn't it have been

11:28.875 --> 11:32.674
easier just not to kick
us out in the first place?

11:32.760 --> 11:35.454
- He's got a point there.
- Bunga...

11:35.462 --> 11:39.197
- Just sayin'...
- Look, I'm really sorry.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.899
That was a mistake.

11:40.934 --> 11:43.825
I Roared at you because
we thought you were hyenas.

11:44.271 --> 11:47.640
Hyenas?
Hyenas?!

11:47.641 --> 11:50.351
Do I look like a hyena to you?

11:50.386 --> 11:51.604
- Pretty much.
- Yep.

11:51.612 --> 11:52.872
Uh-huh.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.780
You aardwolves really don't
get out much, do you?

11:55.783 --> 11:58.543
We still need to find
the rest of your pack.

11:58.552 --> 12:00.612
So we can take you all home.

12:00.621 --> 12:03.626
I don't know...
What's in it for me?

12:04.358 --> 12:08.457
- Well, you get to go home.
- A home that's now

12:08.462 --> 12:10.692
totally overrun
with termites, by the way.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.969
Termites?

12:15.836 --> 12:17.236
Now you're talking!

12:17.237 --> 12:20.109
Why didn't you say so in
the first place? Let's go!

12:20.841 --> 12:23.105
Uh, hey!
Wait for us!

12:25.479 --> 12:27.279
Here. Behind these rocks!

12:29.183 --> 12:30.413
Ooh, look!

12:30.417 --> 12:31.547
Let's hide in there!

12:34.488 --> 12:37.691
This is perfect!
Yes! Totally perfect!

12:37.726 --> 12:40.895
I think.
Yeah, they'll never find us here.

12:41.328 --> 12:42.498
I hope.

12:44.398 --> 12:47.132
Poor, brave Mjomba!

12:47.167 --> 12:49.237
It's because of him we're safe.

12:50.337 --> 12:51.670
Maybe.

12:51.705 --> 12:53.735
I'll take a peek, just to be sure.

12:57.678 --> 12:59.578
Yup. All clear.

13:02.116 --> 13:05.417
Hmm. Ooh.
Something smells delicious!

13:07.020 --> 13:09.890
Aardwolves!

13:09.925 --> 13:12.991
Goigoi!
You hear what I said?

13:13.060 --> 13:15.855
- Love you, too, baby.
- Goigoi!

13:16.630 --> 13:19.598
Wha...?
Was I snorin'?

13:19.600 --> 13:21.900
Oh, never mind.
Keep sleeping if you want.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.762
Just more scrumptious
aardwolf for me and the kids.

13:25.405 --> 13:29.404
- You had me at aardwolf.
- Thought so.

13:29.409 --> 13:32.209
Smells like a whole pack of
'em just moved in next door.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.412
When did the hyraxes move out?

13:34.414 --> 13:37.142
- They didn't.
- Oh, yeah.

13:37.151 --> 13:40.354
- They were delicious.
- Now that you're up,

13:40.389 --> 13:43.557
time we said hello
to our new neighbors.

13:43.592 --> 13:46.387
Whatever you say, dear.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.653
Coming in here was a great idea!

13:48.662 --> 13:51.562
It's roomy, nice and dank,
wall to wall dirt...

13:51.565 --> 13:54.265
Oh. Too bad there's
nothing here to eat.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.465
Oh, I wouldn't say that!

13:59.072 --> 14:03.502
- We're the folks from next door!
- Howdy, neighbors!

14:03.510 --> 14:06.110
You scared us for a second there!

14:06.113 --> 14:08.243
We thought you were
the Lion Guard.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.082
Lion Guard? Where?

14:10.117 --> 14:12.245
It weren't me!
Rairai made me do it!

14:12.252 --> 14:13.312
- Goigoi...
- Hey!

14:15.088 --> 14:17.389
Oh! You don't like 'em either?

14:17.424 --> 14:20.124
Well, don't worry.
They'll never find us.

14:20.127 --> 14:22.527
We totally gave them the slip!

14:22.830 --> 14:26.231
- I think.
- I see.

14:26.266 --> 14:29.766
Well, now, you just set
your minds at ease.

14:29.770 --> 14:32.140
We're the furthest thing
from the Lion Guard.

14:32.175 --> 14:33.779
Believe you me.

14:33.814 --> 14:35.134
And...

14:35.142 --> 14:37.942
Why exactly were you running
away from the Lion Guard?

14:37.945 --> 14:40.515
Because they're mean!
And they're scary!

14:40.550 --> 14:42.444
Say it, sister!

14:42.449 --> 14:45.849
But mainly because Kion's Roar sent
us flying out of the Pride Lands!

14:45.853 --> 14:48.113
And then they came
after us here!

14:48.121 --> 14:49.961
You won't tell them
where we are, will you?

14:49.996 --> 14:51.687
Don't you worry about that.

14:51.692 --> 14:55.552
I promise, the Lion Guard
won't find hide nor hair of you.

14:56.697 --> 14:58.227
Well, maybe a little hide.

14:58.232 --> 15:01.667
- And maybe a little hair.
- Huh?

15:01.668 --> 15:04.038
All we're trying to say is,
as your new neighbors,

15:04.073 --> 15:05.637
we're going to be
such good friends!

15:05.639 --> 15:07.809
And you know what friends do...

15:07.844 --> 15:11.743
Have each other for dinner!
Ow!

15:11.745 --> 15:14.145
He means, have each other
over for dinner.

this cave to hide in!

17:26.680 --> 17:30.449
Oh, no, honey.
We're the lucky ones.

17:30.484 --> 17:32.614
Yep. They're hiding
in that cave all right.

17:32.619 --> 17:35.614
Okay. This time,
we need a good plan.

17:35.622 --> 17:38.390
On it. I'll go in alone.
Oof!

17:38.392 --> 17:40.122
<i>No!</i>

17:40.127 --> 17:42.794
Sorry, Little B.
Nothin' personal.

17:42.829 --> 17:45.699
Mjomba, will you go into that cave?

17:45.734 --> 17:48.199
Tell the other aardwolves
we're not a threat?

17:48.201 --> 17:50.002
Sure. I can do that.

17:50.037 --> 17:52.907
Just pop your head out when
you know they won't run.

17:52.942 --> 17:55.376
Then we can all go back
to the Pride Lands.

17:56.343 --> 17:58.403
Then I can eat!

17:58.412 --> 18:02.312
Unlimited termite feast,
here I come!

18:03.083 --> 18:04.643
Almost unlimited!

18:04.651 --> 18:06.491
Some of those termites
are mine!

18:07.054 --> 18:11.523
- Seriously?
- Never too early to call dibs.

18:11.558 --> 18:14.725
Hello!
Any aardwolves at home?

18:14.728 --> 18:16.158
Private party!

18:16.163 --> 18:19.093
Not at all, not at all,
the more the merrier!

18:19.099 --> 18:21.169
Mjomba! You escaped!

18:21.204 --> 18:24.569
How smart!
How brave!

18:24.604 --> 18:27.739
- It is really you, right?
- Yeah, it's me!

18:27.774 --> 18:31.574
And I've got good news, the
Lion Guard are the good guys.

18:31.578 --> 18:35.443
- They saved me!
- Good guys? No way!

18:35.449 --> 18:37.189
They kicked us out
of the Pride Lands!

18:37.224 --> 18:40.184
Is this another trick?

18:40.187 --> 18:42.017
Are they hiding behind you?

18:43.056 --> 18:46.431
No! And they
didn't mean to kick us out!

18:46.466 --> 18:49.394
- They thought we were hyenas!
- Hyenas?

18:49.429 --> 18:53.699
That's ridic...
Okay, now I see it.

18:53.700 --> 18:57.540
Anyway, they want to take
us back to the Pride Lands.

18:57.575 --> 19:01.277
Since we left,
it's crawling with termites!

19:01.312 --> 19:04.044
Mmm. Termites?
Crawling with 'em?

19:04.079 --> 19:06.704
Yeah, and we can eat 'em all!

19:06.713 --> 19:09.043
They need us to!

19:09.049 --> 19:12.089
You hear that?
We can go home and eat termites!

19:12.124 --> 19:14.315
So, let's go!

19:14.321 --> 19:18.091
Hold on a second! I thought we
were going to have dinner here.

19:18.126 --> 19:21.560
Well, I dunno.
You got any termites?

19:21.595 --> 19:25.065
Oh. Trust me, none of you
are leaving this cave hungry.

19:25.100 --> 19:28.295
In fact, none of you
are leaving at all!

19:28.301 --> 19:30.241
Goigoi! Push!

19:35.008 --> 19:37.578
Something's not right.
Why'd they do that?

19:37.613 --> 19:39.811
Maybe they're still scared of us?

19:39.846 --> 19:41.680
You think they didn't
believe Mjomba?

19:41.715 --> 19:43.515
I promised we'd make things right.

19:43.517 --> 19:44.587
Come on!

19:46.953 --> 19:49.353
Ono. Can you see
through the crack?

19:49.356 --> 19:50.486
I can try.

19:53.093 --> 19:54.493
<i>Hapana!</i>

19:55.428 --> 19:56.658
Jackals!

19:57.831 --> 19:59.431
Should we wait for the kids?

19:59.432 --> 20:01.892
We'll bring 'em
the leftovers.

20:06.139 --> 20:07.209
<i> Twende Kiboko!</i>

20:08.441 --> 20:10.851
Get away from
the aardwolf, Rairai!

20:13.680 --> 20:15.620
Aardwolves!
Follow me!

20:19.119 --> 20:20.519
All clear, Kion!

20:20.520 --> 20:22.120
Kion!

20:22.122 --> 20:23.982
So nice of you to drop by!

20:23.990 --> 20:26.230
Gotta admit, I wish you'd
of come a little later.

20:26.265 --> 20:28.360
I'll bet you do, Rairai.

20:28.395 --> 20:32.017
- Anybody got Goigoi?
- He's not going anywhere.

20:33.366 --> 20:37.508
All right, Rairai.
Time for you to go home!

20:37.543 --> 20:39.134
You betcha!
See ya next visit!

20:40.140 --> 20:41.640
Okay, Bunga!

20:52.152 --> 20:53.812
And stay in there!

20:53.820 --> 20:57.060
<i>Don't you worry about
little ol' us! We love it in here!</i>

20:57.095 --> 20:58.790
<i>Don't we, Goigoi?</i>

20:58.825 --> 21:01.755
<i>Goigoi?</i>

21:01.761 --> 21:04.631
She seemed like
such a good hostess.

21:04.666 --> 21:06.131
Until she tried to eat us.

21:06.166 --> 21:08.766
Yeah, that sorta spoiled the party.

21:08.768 --> 21:12.168
I could really use
a termite about now.

21:12.172 --> 21:14.032
Can we go home and eat?

21:14.040 --> 21:16.580
Best idea I've heard all day.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.559
Hey, buddy, how you doing?

21:28.594 --> 21:30.389
I'm fine. I guess...

21:30.424 --> 21:32.184
Miss the termites?

21:32.192 --> 21:34.222
I'm trying to be
brave about it.

21:34.227 --> 21:35.527
But I gotta admit...

21:36.763 --> 21:38.363
I do miss 'em.

21:38.365 --> 21:40.125
Well...

21:40.133 --> 21:43.633
We've got a little surprise
that might make you feel better.

21:43.637 --> 21:47.207
I don't think there's
anything that could do that.

21:48.708 --> 21:52.448
How about a thank you gift
from the aardwolves?

21:52.483 --> 21:57.984
They saved me some!
Un-Bunga-lievable!

21:58.019 --> 22:01.259
Hey, it's working!
I really do feel better!
