11:38.500 --> 11:40.060
Excuse my French.

11:41.940 --> 11:42.940
Do you speak English?

11:43.300 --> 11:44.260
Yes.

11:44.420 --> 11:45.060
Do you?

11:46.140 --> 11:47.260
Our motorcycle...

11:47.620 --> 11:49.260
..went out of gas
just down the road.

11:50.380 --> 11:51.580
Do you have any gasoline?

11:52.100 --> 11:53.540
No, I don't have any car.

11:54.420 --> 11:55.500
There's not much needed...

11:55.500 --> 11:57.820
..maybe you have like a lawn
mower or something like that?

11:57.820 --> 11:59.660
No, l have nothing with an engine.

12:00.860 --> 12:02.940
How far is it to the
nearest gas station?

12:04.300 --> 12:07.180
It's about 12 kilometres,
outside Saint-Lyphard...

12:07.180 --> 12:08.660
..but it's closed by now.

12:09.780 --> 12:11.180
I've cut myself.

12:11.900 --> 12:12.500
Madam?

12:12.660 --> 12:14.060
Please she's bleeding.

12:14.860 --> 12:16.180
Can you please help us?

12:16.900 --> 12:18.300
_ She'S bleeding!
_ l'm bleeding!

12:18.820 --> 12:20.300
Yeah, just a moment.

12:43.580 --> 12:44.580
Where do you want me?

12:44.740 --> 12:46.100
You can sit on the chair there.

13:06.020 --> 13:08.300
You're the woman we met
by the road earlier, right?

13:08.820 --> 13:10.980
Yes. That's right.

13:12.300 --> 13:14.140
_ Did you find it?
_ Find what?

13:14.980 --> 13:17.620
_ The town you were looking for?
_ Oh yeah, we did.

13:17.820 --> 13:19.020
Thank you for helping us out.

13:24.060 --> 13:25.020
Are you American?

13:26.460 --> 13:27.420
No, we're Norwegian.

13:28.500 --> 13:29.260
I see.

13:30.700 --> 13:31.700
That's very cold.

13:32.060 --> 13:34.260
Yeah, in the winter at least.

13:34.900 --> 13:35.780
Have you ever been?

13:36.540 --> 13:37.700
Yeah, when I was young.

13:38.460 --> 13:39.100
Really?

13:40.100 --> 13:40.940
Did you Iike it?

13:42.100 --> 13:43.140
Quite nice.

13:44.900 --> 13:45.820
Something wrong?

13:49.980 --> 13:50.740
Can you feel it?

13:51.700 --> 13:53.140
- No.
_ It's moving.

13:55.940 --> 13:58.580
I'm sorry, it'S just the
first time l felt it.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.340
It's alright.

14:03.060 --> 14:03.980
When are you due?

14:04.500 --> 14:05.420
In January.

14:09.900 --> 14:11.260
Do you have any children?

14:12.940 --> 14:14.060
It's done.

15:05.060 --> 15:06.860
I've got a guest room upstairs.

15:37.900 --> 15:39.620
Is this alright?

15:39.620 --> 15:41.100
_ Sure.
_ Yeah, it's perfect.

15:42.420 --> 15:43.020
Thank you.

15:47.900 --> 15:49.300
Would you like some supper?

15:49.300 --> 15:50.940
Yeah, we would love some.

15:50.940 --> 15:51.660
I would!

15:52.020 --> 15:52.860
AIright.

16:44.220 --> 16:45.660
I Iove this house.

16:46.060 --> 16:47.260
It's so quiet here.

16:48.180 --> 16:49.740
That's why l bought it.

16:50.300 --> 16:51.500
To find the peace to write?

16:52.980 --> 16:55.140
I noticed your name on a
couple of books up there.

16:55.740 --> 16:56.900
Vivienne Noir, right?

16:57.180 --> 16:57.820
Well.

16:59.300 --> 17:00.420
What's your real name?

17:02.580 --> 17:03.980
It is a pen name l reckon?

17:04.300 --> 17:06.020
It's so awful l won't tell you.

17:06.020 --> 17:06.660
Really?

17:19.099 --> 17:20.460
How did you know my name?

17:20.900 --> 17:21.819
You told me.

17:22.940 --> 17:23.780
Did l?

17:23.780 --> 17:24.420
Yeah...

17:25.300 --> 17:26.619
..outside on the porch.

17:29.660 --> 17:33.820
No, I didn't move out here to write.
lt was rather the opposite.

17:35.300 --> 17:38.540
To be honest l never really liked
the writing. It was just a job.

17:38.700 --> 17:41.860
Like selling shoes or whatever.
Something one has to do.

17:41.860 --> 17:43.820
You must've sold a Iot of shoes.

17:44.140 --> 17:45.060
What do you mean?

17:45.220 --> 17:46.820
I mean, since you
can afford all this.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.980
I can cope, yes.

17:51.180 --> 17:52.140
Smells wonderful.

17:53.740 --> 17:54.740
Dinner is ready.

17:56.540 --> 17:58.260
Cheers!

18:03.300 --> 18:04.260
Enjoy your meal.

18:05.340 --> 18:07.140
_ Is this a..?
_ It's a pheasant.

18:07.980 --> 18:09.060
I've never tasted it.

18:10.820 --> 18:12.620
It's actually really good Vivienne.

18:12.780 --> 18:14.260
I'm gIad to hear it.

18:14.940 --> 18:17.300
You know, we've just had
bread since Berlin l think.

18:17.300 --> 18:19.140
So this is really
something else.

18:21.220 --> 18:23.180
Why do you travel
on a motorbike?

18:23.780 --> 18:25.260
Isn't that rather bumpy?

18:25.420 --> 18:27.140
Yeah, but you get used to it.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.980
I wanted Isabel to see
some of the world before...

18:31.460 --> 18:32.180
Well.

18:33.700 --> 18:34.820
We're expecting.

18:34.820 --> 18:36.020
Isabel is pregnant.

18:37.620 --> 18:38.740
Congratulations.

18:38.940 --> 18:39.580
Thank you.

18:39.900 --> 18:41.980
So we had to do it before...

18:43.020 --> 18:45.620
..you know, having a child is a
Iot of responsibility for a woman.

18:50.860 --> 18:52.620
Actually we're going to
head further south...

18:52.620 --> 18:55.260
..so maybe you have some
recommendations for us?

18:56.620 --> 19:00.340
Oh, you should stop by
La plage de la Mine-d'Or.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.660
Outside Pénestin.

19:02.220 --> 19:03.020
What is it?

19:03.540 --> 19:04.380
It's a beach.

19:05.940 --> 19:07.140
Yeah, we should see it.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.540
It's a beautiful pIace.

19:10.340 --> 19:12.420
Maybe if the weather is nice,
we could spend the night?

19:12.780 --> 19:13.380
Sure.

19:15.340 --> 19:17.300
Have you known each
other for a long time?

19:17.740 --> 19:18.980
Yeah we have actuaIly.

19:18.980 --> 19:20.300
We met at a party first.

19:20.820 --> 19:23.780
I was out with my ballet
dancer friends, and then...

19:23.780 --> 19:27.380
..Markus he was going to a
party on the floor above us.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.140
And then he went to the
wrong party you see.

19:30.140 --> 19:32.180
No I didn't go wrong.
I found you.

19:35.900 --> 19:39.180
Well, I was actually a dancer
myself in my younger days.

19:40.500 --> 19:44.660
But a bad knee put an end to it.
So l started writing books instead.

19:44.940 --> 19:46.260
I'm so sorry to hear that.

19:46.820 --> 19:47.540
That's life.

19:49.620 --> 19:51.660
I don't know what l would
do if l couldn't dance.

19:52.220 --> 19:53.780
I would be devastated I think.

19:55.180 --> 19:55.900
Do you miss it?

19:56.060 --> 19:56.660
No.

19:57.180 --> 19:59.060
I'm too old for
that kind of thing.

20:01.900 --> 20:04.460
My fiancé was dancing as well.

20:05.140 --> 20:06.260
_ Really?
_ Mhm.

20:06.500 --> 20:07.340
What happened?

20:08.340 --> 20:09.300
What do you mean?

20:09.300 --> 20:10.780
Between you and your fiancé?

20:12.300 --> 20:13.260
Love ended.

20:13.700 --> 20:14.740
He found someone else?

20:15.060 --> 20:15.900
Someone younger?

20:16.700 --> 20:17.580
And more pretty?

20:19.460 --> 20:21.420
Is that the only reason
you can think of

20:25.020 --> 20:26.180
Sorry, I didn't mean to pry.

20:33.420 --> 20:37.460
A child can be rather devastating
for a dancing career, isn't it so?

20:38.940 --> 20:39.900
It can.

20:39.900 --> 20:40.820
No, I don't think so.

20:41.180 --> 20:43.420
There's a lot of dancers
who are also parents.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.980
Would you like some
wine my dear?

20:50.180 --> 20:52.620
Yeah, actually a small sip
won't do any harm l think.

20:52.620 --> 20:53.980
No, I wouldn't do that.

20:56.820 --> 20:59.060
- Markus?
_ No. We've discussed it.

21:00.780 --> 21:03.020
_ It's next to nothing.
_ You won't drink that.

21:04.100 --> 21:05.780
_Are you kidding?
_ No, l'm not.

21:06.700 --> 21:07.620
Put it down.

21:08.460 --> 21:09.260
Markus!

21:09.860 --> 21:11.300
I'll go and get some more.

21:15.220 --> 21:16.260
Give me that glass.

21:17.340 --> 21:19.620
_ I'm not drinking any.
_ Give it to me.

23:08.060 --> 23:09.820
Thanks for a lovely evening.

23:10.620 --> 23:11.580
You're welcome.

23:12.540 --> 23:13.260
Good night.

28:37.980 --> 28:38.900
My God!

28:39.820 --> 28:42.180
_ Did l scare you?
_ Sorry...

28:42.900 --> 28:45.060
_ I didn't mean to...
_ No, you're fine.

28:45.500 --> 28:46.700
Just don't mind me.

31:07.380 --> 31:09.060
Where does the rest
of your family live?

31:10.540 --> 31:11.660
I never had any.

31:13.060 --> 31:14.460
Well, you didn't have anyone?

31:16.980 --> 31:18.940
I grew up in a...

31:19.380 --> 31:20.860
..what do you call it?

31:21.300 --> 31:22.420
Un orpheIinat.

31:26.100 --> 31:27.100
An orphanage.

31:33.860 --> 31:36.580
Actually there was this one thing
I wanted to ask you about...

31:36.580 --> 31:40.820
Yesterday I was outside in your
garden, and I saw this cross...

31:40.820 --> 31:43.020
..or a tombstone or something.

31:43.540 --> 31:44.660
Who's buried there?

31:45.660 --> 31:46.420
Jean-Luc.

31:51.900 --> 31:53.540
He was run over by a car.

31:54.780 --> 31:55.620
My cat.

32:01.060 --> 32:02.340
Do you know who did it?

32:02.860 --> 32:04.660
Probably one of the neighbours.

32:05.340 --> 32:07.700
There's no one else
driving past here.

32:08.620 --> 32:10.020
Except you of course.

32:14.020 --> 32:15.300
So when are you leaving?

32:16.660 --> 32:19.220
Markus had some trouble
with the engine...

32:19.220 --> 32:22.380
..but as soon as he's done with that,
l guess we'll be out of her in no time.

32:22.380 --> 32:22.980
Good.

32:57.100 --> 32:57.860
Good morning.

35:06.980 --> 35:10.140

39:24.820 --> 39:27.100

39:35.780 --> 39:37.740
We just wanted

39:40.180 --> 39:40.740
Listen.

39:42.420 --> 39:45.140
Listen Vivienne.
We fixed the motorcycle.

39:45.900 --> 39:47.660
We just wanted to
thank you, that's all.

39:48.860 --> 39:50.020
We bought you a cake.

39:50.020 --> 39:52.940
_ You're after my money, I know.
_ No! Vivienne!

39:53.340 --> 39:55.700
_ You're after my money.
_ Vivienne, calm down!

40:39.060 --> 40:39.780

40:42.500 --> 40:43.500
Are you okay?

40:44.620 --> 40:46.700
You're being silly!
We didn't mean to scare you.

40:47.020 --> 40:48.060
What do you want?

40:48.740 --> 40:53.100
We want you to come out. We're leaving
soon, so we wanted to say goodbye.

40:54.620 --> 40:55.740
Just a moment.

47:46.380 --> 47:47.660
I've made you a cup of tea.

47:49.020 --> 47:49.940
That's sweet.

47:52.660 --> 47:53.780
Careful it's hot.

48:00.660 --> 48:01.580
How are you feeling?

48:03.220 --> 48:04.100
Not too well.

48:05.740 --> 48:08.020
Guess there's just a lot
going on at the moment.

48:09.220 --> 48:12.260
Too bad. Could've been
a nice day for the beach.

48:14.100 --> 48:15.860
Maybe you can
take Markus out?

48:16.580 --> 48:17.500
He would love that.

48:18.900 --> 48:19.700
Why not?

48:35.100 --> 48:36.980
I'm sure the tea will
make you feel better.

50:46.060 --> 50:47.380
The water is actually nice!

50:55.300 --> 50:56.020
How was he?

50:57.220 --> 50:58.980
_ Who?
_ Your fiancé.

51:02.460 --> 51:03.100
Well...

51:07.540 --> 51:08.860
He was handsome.

51:10.060 --> 51:10.780
Tall.

51:11.580 --> 51:12.420
Blue eyes.

51:15.220 --> 51:17.300
He reminds me a
bit of you actually.

51:22.740 --> 51:24.060
Sounds like a nice guy.

51:24.540 --> 51:25.100
Yeah...

51:26.180 --> 51:26.900
He was.

51:30.420 --> 51:31.900
I met him at a party.

51:33.940 --> 51:35.860
He wasn't supposed to be there.

51:38.180 --> 51:41.980
He made sure that everybody
paid attention to him.

51:43.660 --> 51:44.580
And l did.

51:47.300 --> 51:48.300
So he stayed.

51:49.420 --> 51:50.340
For the night.

51:52.580 --> 51:53.700
And the day after.

51:57.780 --> 51:59.660
Until one day.

52:07.460 --> 52:08.460
Do you still love him?

52:12.060 --> 52:12.980
What do you mean?

52:14.860 --> 52:15.860
Do you still love him?

52:16.500 --> 52:18.380
Well, what difference
does that make?

52:20.900 --> 52:21.820
Maybe nothing.

52:23.380 --> 52:24.500
Let's go for a swim!

52:25.300 --> 52:27.100
No, I'm better here thanks.

53:29.340 --> 53:30.380
Isabel!

53:43.380 --> 53:44.260
Isabel?

54:03.420 --> 54:04.540
I'm sorry.

54:09.900 --> 54:12.260
_ Sorry!
_ What do you mean?

54:15.340 --> 54:16.180
Isabel!

54:20.140 --> 54:20.940
What's happened?

54:23.020 --> 54:25.380
- I'm sorry
_ For what?

56:34.900 --> 56:38.340

58:54.300 --> 58:56.940

58:56.940 --> 59:00.540
_ Who's calling?
_ It's Vivienne Hansen.

59:02.180 --> 59:04.540

_ l won't talk to her.

59:04.540 --> 59:06.460

59:06.900 --> 59:08.700
The doctor is not available.

59:08.980 --> 59:11.580

59:11.820 --> 59:13.940

01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:17.820

01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:21.060
Yes, I think so.

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:39.300
Kind of l guess.

01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:42.940

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.660
No, it's alright.
Nothing to worry about.
