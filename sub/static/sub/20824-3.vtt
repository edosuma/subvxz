WEBVTT

00:10.444 --> 00:13.412
We risk our lives for $500.

00:13.414 --> 00:15.047
What the hell happened?

00:15.049 --> 00:16.915
I don't know! Why are we
still letting her run shit?

00:16.917 --> 00:19.251
She just uses us
to get what she wants.

00:19.253 --> 00:21.186
We want more of a say
in what jobs we do.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.155
I'm the mother,
so that makes me the boss.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.991
From now on, you do whatever
you think is right.

00:25.993 --> 00:27.292
I wanna stay.

00:27.294 --> 00:29.194
Best be careful, man, okay?

00:31.399 --> 00:34.266
Mommy! Lena, this is
Daddy's friend, Lucy.

00:34.268 --> 00:35.801
Her mother left her,
you're banging some woman

00:35.803 --> 00:38.537
that she's never seen before
in her mother's bedroom.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.939
- You two a thing now?
- I don't know.

00:40.941 --> 00:43.275
Why don't you come stay
at the house for a little while?

00:43.277 --> 00:45.677
I'm Amy. I run a Bible study.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.212
You should come sometime.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.415
Baz is gonna come to you
in a little while.

00:49.417 --> 00:51.717
I'd be careful not to let
that boy's recklessness

00:51.719 --> 00:54.586
come back and hit me
in the face if I were you.

00:54.588 --> 00:57.089
He wants to see you.
He's running out of time.

00:57.091 --> 00:58.957
On my own terms.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.292
May we all get what we want...

01:00.294 --> 01:03.095
And never what we deserve.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074

02:09.130 --> 02:10.429
When we get there,

02:10.431 --> 02:12.631
I'm gonna need you
to watch my back.

02:12.633 --> 02:15.234
At a funeral?
And keep your mouth shut.

02:15.236 --> 02:18.403
We're going to pay our respects
and leave.

02:23.844 --> 02:27.312
So this, this Manny guy,

02:27.314 --> 02:29.281
when was the last time
you saw him?

02:29.283 --> 02:33.819
20 years ago maybe.

02:48.102 --> 02:49.401
Yeah.

02:49.403 --> 02:50.869
<i>Hey, man, where are you?</i>

02:50.871 --> 02:52.437
My place. Why?

02:52.439 --> 02:55.941
I need a favor.
I'm down in Mexico.

02:55.943 --> 02:59.311
<i>- I'm gettin' stuff for the job.
- Yeah?</i>

02:59.313 --> 03:00.879
How's Lucy?

03:00.881 --> 03:03.815
Smurf took off out of town
and she won't say where.

03:03.817 --> 03:06.952
I'm supposed to pick up
Lena after school.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.854
Well, if you leave now,
no hassle at the border.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.556
<i>- You'll make it.
- No, Pope. I can't.</i>

03:10.558 --> 03:12.090
I can't. Can you help me out?

03:12.092 --> 03:14.826
Can you pick her up?

03:14.828 --> 03:16.228
Look, the shit I said...

03:16.230 --> 03:20.165
<i>When should I tell Lena
you'll be back?</i>

03:20.167 --> 03:21.967
Tomorrow.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.276
- Hey, where the hell is Marco?
- He's coming.

03:31.278 --> 03:35.113
<i>Carlos, don't shove the chayote
around the plate, por favor.</i>

03:35.115 --> 03:36.415
<i>Ya te dije, eat it.</i>

03:38.786 --> 03:41.587
You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. When do
you think he's gonna get here?

03:41.589 --> 03:44.056
Is this how you always get
before a job or just this one?

03:44.058 --> 03:48.193
- This one being...
- Yeah, first without Smurf.

03:48.195 --> 03:49.861
It has to go smoothly.

03:49.863 --> 03:52.931
Show her it's real, that you're
handling things now.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.400
Every job has to go smoothly.

03:57.137 --> 03:59.638
Marco's here.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.377
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.212
<i>- What's up?
- Hola.</i>

04:08.749 --> 04:10.449
<i>- Â¿CÃ³mo estÃ¡?
- Bien, bien.</i>

04:10.451 --> 04:12.884
<i>- Hey, hola, Tio Marco.
- -Hola.</i>

04:12.886 --> 04:15.220
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's do it.

04:15.222 --> 04:16.822
Let's go.

04:16.824 --> 04:19.156
- Ciao.
- Bye.

04:19.159 --> 04:21.526
Thought Smurf didn't want you
doing anything with me?

04:21.528 --> 04:24.630
Well, Smurf's not in charge anymore.
Since when?

04:29.103 --> 04:32.104
Hey. Come on in. So I actually
want you to start it off

04:32.106 --> 04:35.240
'cause I feel like you're gonna
have the best read on it.

04:35.242 --> 04:37.109
Okay.

04:37.111 --> 04:39.077
Loved this place.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.113
My friends
and I used to sneak in here

04:41.115 --> 04:42.447
before we were legal.

04:42.449 --> 04:45.450
Yeah, it's a great beach dive.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.919
You know, just good cheap beer
and no bullshit.

04:47.921 --> 04:50.722
- That's how I'm gonna keep it.
- Love that.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.591
Yeah, I'm gonna open up
this room a bit.

04:52.593 --> 04:55.394
- Lose the drop ceiling.
- In a week?

04:55.396 --> 04:56.995
Yeah, you gotta get earnin',
man.

04:56.997 --> 05:00.265
No, I'm just sayin', that's...
That's a lot of work.

05:00.267 --> 05:02.401
- You both the owners?
- Yeah.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.269
No, it's just me.

05:04.271 --> 05:06.371
Technicality.

05:07.408 --> 05:11.009
Like the fire pits
down in San Onofre.

05:11.011 --> 05:14.413
- Back in the day.
- Yep. That's what I'm going for.

05:14.415 --> 05:18.684
The feel of those Friday nights
before this place got taken over

05:18.686 --> 05:21.586
by all the Newport money
and tourists.

05:21.588 --> 05:24.556
Speaking of Fridays,

05:24.558 --> 05:28.160
I had sex in that bathroom
with Jeff McNoughton.

05:28.162 --> 05:30.629
- Okay.
- Whoa. You're hired.

05:32.199 --> 05:33.832
What? She's got history here.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.968
So you a sink girl
or a stall girl?

05:36.970 --> 05:39.037
- I'm... I'm a sink guy.
- Okay, Jesus, man.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.273
Definitely a sink girl.
I can tell. I can tell.

05:41.275 --> 05:44.242
Okay, all right.
That's good. Thanks, bud.

05:45.913 --> 05:49.448
So how long have you
bartended for?

05:49.450 --> 05:50.916
- Seven years.
- Seven years.

05:50.918 --> 05:54.486
Barback, two. I can text
you guys my references.

05:54.488 --> 05:58.190
Yeah. That'd be great. Yeah.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.591
Yeah, that would be great.

05:59.593 --> 06:02.861
I'll walk you out. Okay.

06:04.331 --> 06:07.332
Um, so if everything works out,

06:07.334 --> 06:10.202
you think you could,
start next week?

06:10.204 --> 06:11.737
- Yeah.
- Cool.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.271
Got your liquor license yet?

06:13.273 --> 06:16.541
Temporary one with the lease.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.744
But I'm getting
the real one tomorrow.

06:18.746 --> 06:22.013
- I have an interview, so...
- It's a shitload of red tape.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.949
My ex tried to get one
and couldn't,

06:23.951 --> 06:25.417
but then he had a record.

06:25.419 --> 06:28.420
Shit.

06:28.422 --> 06:30.088
Yeah. I'm sure it'll be fine.

06:30.090 --> 06:33.492
Yeah. I'll get you those references.
Great.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.693
- See you next week.
- Yeah.

06:34.695 --> 06:37.295
- I hope.
- Later, sink girl.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.732
I like her.

06:42.236 --> 06:44.069
Well, II think
the most important part is...

06:44.071 --> 06:46.805
Is the first part.
God is faithful. Right?

06:46.807 --> 06:50.542
Because no matter what we do
even when we stop listening,

06:50.544 --> 06:52.177
- He's there.
- Praise God.

06:52.179 --> 06:55.580
Right. Right. So His love
is unconditional. Exactly.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.784
Yes. That's not the
point of the verse.

06:58.786 --> 07:02.120
What do you think it is, Andrew?

07:02.122 --> 07:03.889
The end part.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.724
God is faithful.

07:05.726 --> 07:09.127
He will not let you be tried
beyond what you are able to bear

07:09.129 --> 07:12.464
but with the trial will also
provide a way out,

07:12.466 --> 07:14.065
so that you may be able
to endure it.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.801
That's the part that matters...

07:15.803 --> 07:20.839
How we can bear anything
if we have to.

07:20.841 --> 07:25.544
Right. Because he loves you.
So II guess we're both right.

07:25.546 --> 07:26.945
It doesn't say that.

07:26.947 --> 07:30.015
It just says He'll get
you through.

07:30.017 --> 07:33.718
The beauty of the Gospel is
the meaning can be clear

07:33.720 --> 07:36.488
- to each of us...
- That's right.

07:36.490 --> 07:39.791
In a very different way.
Yes. Amen.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.960
- Yeah.
- Right.

08:05.652 --> 08:10.188
Hey. I heard you drive in. I
thought I'd check in on ya.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.390
What are those for?

08:12.392 --> 08:15.427
Me and Deran we,
we bought a bar.

08:15.429 --> 08:18.663
What? Yeah, it's a total dive,
but we're gonna make it cool.

08:18.665 --> 08:19.931
That's why I haven't been
texting you

08:19.933 --> 08:22.601
'cause been working
our balls off.

08:22.603 --> 08:25.003
Gutting it and, you know,
all the rest.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.638
Can I come see it?

08:26.640 --> 08:29.808
Sure, when it's... done.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.676
You know, Smurf and J
are outta town.

08:31.678 --> 08:35.212
We've got the whole house to ourselves.
Yeah, II gotta get back.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.749
Come over tonight.
They won't be back.

08:37.751 --> 08:42.520
We're gonna be workin'
all night, so...

08:42.523 --> 08:44.523
- Yeah, I get it.
- Yeah?

08:49.897 --> 08:52.063
Thanks, everyone.
See you all next week.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.366
- Good night, Amy.
- Bye, Jaymie.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.374
Hey.

09:02.376 --> 09:04.976
The church is having a kids'
softball game tomorrow

09:04.978 --> 09:09.047
at Capistrano Park.
You wanna come?

09:09.049 --> 09:13.118
Bring lunch? Lena could play.

09:16.323 --> 09:18.390
Text me if you wanna.

09:18.392 --> 09:21.560
I can pick you guys up.

10:06.239 --> 10:08.239
Watch your back in there, baby.

10:08.241 --> 10:11.977
Manny's crew have always been
a bunch of scumbags.

10:50.450 --> 10:53.251
Hey.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.154
Stop.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.424
This is my grandson, J.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.126
- Good to meet you.
- You, too.

11:01.128 --> 11:05.363
Jake and I used to work with
Manny before he left California.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.665
Met your grandma
when she was your age.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.166
Yeah? What was she like?

11:08.168 --> 11:10.201
Sexy and tough as shit.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.704
Go grab us a beer.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.706
I'll take that.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.217
My beer.

11:29.890 --> 11:34.459
Manny wasn't lying when he said
he needed the cash.

11:34.461 --> 11:37.996
Before he got sick,
Manny's crew wanted Javi out.

11:37.998 --> 11:42.600
Javi's running jobs for now...
Drugs, girls, guns.

11:42.602 --> 11:44.703
Manny's crew all bitch
about him.

11:44.705 --> 11:46.738
Say he's a sick piece of shit.

11:46.740 --> 11:49.040
He beat one of his guys
to death.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.308
Left him in the yard
with his dogs

11:50.310 --> 11:53.545
till there was nothing left.

11:56.917 --> 12:00.318
Shit.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.721
What you doin'?

12:02.723 --> 12:04.622
Research for the liquor license

12:04.624 --> 12:06.725
and a business plan
for the inspector.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.460
I got a business plan for you.

12:08.462 --> 12:10.995
- Yeah?
- Sell booze, make money.

12:10.997 --> 12:12.597
- That's great.
- Yeah?

12:12.599 --> 12:14.065
Yeah, that's real helpful.
I'll put that down.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.735
You know, I'm thinking
we should do aan after hours.

12:16.737 --> 12:18.470
Get known for it,
make it a thing.

12:18.472 --> 12:21.039
Yeah, and what?
Get shut down immediately?

12:21.041 --> 12:25.276
Do you have any idea how serious
this is?

12:25.278 --> 12:29.814
I mean, it's even... it's on me
if some asshole gets drunk

12:29.816 --> 12:33.251
and gets in his car, so...

12:33.253 --> 12:35.353
All right.

12:35.355 --> 12:38.957
So, we gonna do this or what?

12:40.527 --> 12:42.961
Yeah, soon as I'm finished.

12:50.137 --> 12:53.705
All right.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.576
Hey, hey. Stop, stop!
What are you doing?

12:58.578 --> 12:59.844
What?

12:59.846 --> 13:02.447
Are you kidding me, man?

13:02.449 --> 13:05.250
I said that wall. Not this wall.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.685
Jesus.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.005
When is Daddy coming back?

13:27.007 --> 13:31.009
Tomorrow. Hopefully.

13:33.413 --> 13:36.648
Come on. Let's get you
something to eat.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.854
Seriously, man.
What's your problem?

13:42.856 --> 13:45.089
You're tense as shit.

13:45.091 --> 13:47.492
This is supposed to be fun.

13:50.030 --> 13:53.865
II got a record, man. I... It's
up to this inspector whether

13:53.867 --> 13:55.300
I get the license or not.
And I don't know if...

13:55.302 --> 13:58.970
Dude, plenty of excons
have bars.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.705
He could turn me down, man.
I don't know.

14:00.707 --> 14:03.074
So just look him in the eye,
tell him you have a record,

14:03.076 --> 14:04.709
and slide him some cash.

14:04.711 --> 14:07.912
He's a liquor inspector, man.
He's not doing it for the glory.

14:07.914 --> 14:09.848
All Smurf's buildings,

14:09.850 --> 14:12.917
all the palms she's greased
worked for her, didn't it?

14:12.919 --> 14:14.953
Yeah, maybe.

14:14.955 --> 14:18.790
Come on. Here.

14:22.796 --> 14:24.963
All right, you stupid mermaid.

14:27.801 --> 14:29.834
Whoa!

14:40.580 --> 14:43.047
Go ahead and eat, man.

14:49.256 --> 14:51.623
So you, um, you live with Smurf?

14:51.625 --> 14:53.791
Ever since my mom died.

14:53.793 --> 14:55.660
And she took you in?

14:58.398 --> 15:01.766
She ever...
She ever talk about me?

15:01.768 --> 15:04.836
I haven't been there
all that long.

15:06.907 --> 15:08.973
I'm sorry about your dad,
by the way.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.511
Manny.

15:13.513 --> 15:16.414
Nah, he wasn't my dad.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.591
What's she really doing here?

15:26.593 --> 15:28.993
What do you mean?

15:28.995 --> 15:30.528
Smurf.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.697
What's she want?

15:36.436 --> 15:39.070
Enjoy your meal.

16:08.335 --> 16:11.469
I heard you showed.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.572
I had to see it for myself.

16:14.574 --> 16:18.176
Never thought he'd go so fast.

16:18.178 --> 16:22.313
Yeah, well, there was
nothing fast about it.

16:22.315 --> 16:25.350
I made that clear
the other night.

16:25.352 --> 16:29.354
Here's a little something
to help pay for the day.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.356
What? Is this how
you fix things?

16:31.358 --> 16:34.225
Nothing to fix, baby.

16:34.227 --> 16:36.160
Just paying my respects.

16:46.706 --> 16:51.209
I always loved that smell.

16:51.211 --> 16:55.013
Reminds me of those Sunday
nights out by your pool.

16:55.015 --> 16:57.048
You'd bring out all that food,

16:57.050 --> 16:59.617
and I'd eat
till my stomach hurt,

16:59.619 --> 17:03.254
just to see you smile.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.490
We all would...

17:05.492 --> 17:09.861
Manny, Jake, my dad.

17:10.896 --> 17:15.199
It was back when
you called us a family.

17:15.201 --> 17:20.972
You know, I heard you...
the night my dad took off.

17:20.973 --> 17:23.340
You and Manny were fighting
on the street

17:23.343 --> 17:24.776
about what to do with me.

17:24.778 --> 17:26.778
You were a 10yearold kid, Javi.

17:26.780 --> 17:30.248
You don't know what you heard.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.350
You told him to throw me out
like I was a piece of trash

17:32.352 --> 17:33.618
is what I heard.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.820
Is that what I said?

17:37.991 --> 17:39.657
Why'd you come?

17:39.659 --> 17:41.259
Pay my respects
to an old friend.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.428
That's a bunch of bullshit.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.963
Why you really here?
Who you looking for?

17:48.835 --> 17:53.137
You take good care of yourself
now, Javi, okay?

17:53.139 --> 17:57.775
I'm keeping this, by the way.
It was always mine.

18:16.529 --> 18:19.664
So Smurf retired?
How'd that happen?

18:19.666 --> 18:21.299
She'd lost a step,
and it was time.

18:21.301 --> 18:25.136
So who's running things now?

18:25.138 --> 18:26.771
Me and Pope.

18:26.773 --> 18:31.242
<i>Pope? You mean
you're running things.</i>

18:31.244 --> 18:32.577
So what's up?

18:32.579 --> 18:34.445
Is there any opportunities?

18:34.447 --> 18:36.047
You and me? Like the old days?

18:36.049 --> 18:39.083
Nah, man. I don't do that
shit anymore. It's too risky.

18:39.085 --> 18:40.952
- I'm not talkin' drugs, man.
- What, then?

18:40.954 --> 18:43.588
- Tourists.
- Tourists?

18:43.590 --> 18:45.857
Yeah. Jewelry.

18:45.859 --> 18:47.592
I got a couple guys
working hotels.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.026
It's a good operation.
Could move a lot more

18:49.028 --> 18:50.495
if I could fence some
of the bigger pieces

18:50.497 --> 18:52.230
to your contacts up north.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.265
I'm already into something, Marco.
What do you think I'm doing here?

18:54.267 --> 18:57.101
- It's not a job. It's easy cash.
- What is it, then? What, what?

18:57.103 --> 19:00.238
What? I've got this bracelet.
20 grand.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.772
Go to your fence, take 20%.

19:01.774 --> 19:04.575
- 30.
- Marco, it's not the cut.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.043
<i>Eso todo.</i>

19:06.045 --> 19:09.180
Good? Let's see.

19:09.182 --> 19:11.048
Ba ba ba ba ba.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.316
Looks good. How much?

19:12.318 --> 19:14.185
<i>- Mil cien.
- $1,100.</i>

19:19.526 --> 19:22.160
<i>- Yeah? Gracias.
- Gracias.</i>

19:31.804 --> 19:34.272
Why are you doing that?

19:34.274 --> 19:39.744
Because it's important to keep
your stuff in order, Lena.

19:39.746 --> 19:42.647
Remember I said that.

19:42.649 --> 19:45.416
That lady, Amy, remember her?

19:45.418 --> 19:49.020
She's coming by tomorrow
to take us to a softball game.

19:49.022 --> 19:51.189
Does that sound fun?

19:51.191 --> 19:52.790
Sure.

20:06.439 --> 20:09.941
The sun blinds them.

20:09.943 --> 20:13.110
If it doesn't get up,
Mommy hits them with a brick.

20:13.112 --> 20:17.248
You know, so it doesn't
hurt anymore.

20:19.052 --> 20:23.654
How long does it usually take...
to know if it's gonna get up?

20:23.656 --> 20:26.224
Not long.

20:29.963 --> 20:32.029
I don't think it's getting up.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.784
You don't have to look.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.446
Is Carlos asleep?

21:22.448 --> 21:25.182
Finally.

21:25.184 --> 21:27.918
He said he likes you being here.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.454
I told him not to get used to it.
Yeah, good.

21:30.456 --> 21:31.989
Wouldn't want him to.

21:31.991 --> 21:35.993
Did you get everything
you needed today from Eduardo?

21:35.995 --> 21:38.896
- Yeah. Yeah, I did.
- Good.

21:38.898 --> 21:42.867
Hey, did Marco told you
something about a bracelet?

21:42.869 --> 21:44.268
Yeah.

21:44.270 --> 21:47.605
The whole pitch. The hotels,
everything. Yeah.

21:47.607 --> 21:50.308
- That's so stupid. God.
- What?

21:50.310 --> 21:53.878
He just... he has to play
the big man with you

21:53.880 --> 21:56.147
every single time. Can't just...

21:56.149 --> 21:59.884
- Can't just tell you the truth.
- What's the truth?

21:59.886 --> 22:01.385
What?

22:03.423 --> 22:06.891
- II think he's in trouble.
- What kind of trouble?

22:06.893 --> 22:08.626
I don't know exactly.
I'm not sure.

22:08.628 --> 22:11.162
It just seems like
he needs some cash,

22:11.164 --> 22:13.364
and so I'm afraid he's gonna
unload that thing

22:13.366 --> 22:14.965
somewhere he shouldn't.

22:14.967 --> 22:17.802
- The bracelet?
- Yeah.

22:22.442 --> 22:24.675
I mean, do you want me
to sell it? I can sell it.

22:24.677 --> 22:26.610
No. I know you don't trust him.

22:26.612 --> 22:29.914
I don't trust your brother.
You don't trust your brother.

22:29.916 --> 22:33.117
That's not true.

22:36.756 --> 22:39.623
Look, why don't I take it? I have to
talk to one of our fences anyhow.

22:39.625 --> 22:43.094
Why don't I take the bracelet,
see what she can do with it?

22:43.096 --> 22:45.429
- How 'bout that?
- Are you sure?

22:45.431 --> 22:47.965
Yeah, it's not a big deal.

22:52.472 --> 22:54.872
That Javi guy... he said that,

22:54.874 --> 22:56.674
he said that
Manny wasn't his dad.

22:56.676 --> 22:58.542
No.

22:58.544 --> 23:02.413
Javi's dad was some guy
who used to pull jobs with us

23:02.415 --> 23:05.182
until he ripped us off and left
town with all the money.

23:08.621 --> 23:10.888
Give me a minute.

23:28.608 --> 23:31.175
Well?

23:31.177 --> 23:33.244
Time I left,
Javi's guys were so wasted,

23:33.246 --> 23:35.713
they were fighting each other.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.848
They're idiots.

23:37.850 --> 23:40.384
Did you talk to anyone,
get a sense of what...

23:40.386 --> 23:43.721
There's something.

23:43.723 --> 23:45.523
Manny's memory was goin'.

23:45.525 --> 23:49.393
His doctor told him to record
shit to help him remember.

23:49.395 --> 23:52.363
Like what? Like anything
that came into his head.

23:52.365 --> 23:55.166
Names he remembered.

23:55.168 --> 23:57.802
A few of these guys say
that's all he did at the end.

23:57.804 --> 24:04.041
Just sit, saying shit into
one of the mini tape recorders.

24:16.756 --> 24:19.190
You sure you can't come over? I've
got the whole place to myself.

24:19.192 --> 24:21.425
<i>I'm going to a movie with
my parents and little sister.</i>

24:21.427 --> 24:24.361
<i>Some animated thing.
Family date night.</i>

24:24.363 --> 24:27.665
<i>- Ouch.
- Trust me, I know. Later.</i>

24:27.667 --> 24:29.300
Okay, bye.

26:06.399 --> 26:09.767
Don't get that gross skin on it.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.669
I know how to warm up milk.

26:11.671 --> 26:14.271
Smurf used to do it for me, too,
when I couldn't sleep,

26:14.273 --> 26:19.343
except she used the microwave,
which was cheating.

26:19.345 --> 26:21.946
Is Mommy dead?

26:25.518 --> 26:27.217
What?

26:34.026 --> 26:36.627
There's no reason to think that.

26:36.629 --> 26:38.963
Where is she?

26:38.965 --> 26:41.899
I don't know, but...

26:41.901 --> 26:44.168
but she wouldn't want you
to be sad.

26:44.170 --> 26:46.637
<i>I am sad.</i>

26:46.639 --> 26:49.974
Why isn't Daddy sad?

26:51.911 --> 26:54.244
Your... your dad is sad.

26:54.246 --> 26:56.180
He's...

26:57.583 --> 27:00.250
He's secret sad.

27:12.932 --> 27:15.933
My dad left when I was little,

27:15.935 --> 27:18.669
and I'm okay.

27:18.671 --> 27:21.238
You will be, too.

27:32.251 --> 27:33.951
So you and Manny ran the crew?

27:33.953 --> 27:35.352
Manny ran it.

27:35.354 --> 27:40.157
Baby, I was only 16 years old
when I met him.

27:40.159 --> 27:43.894
I'd just done a 5day stint
in county on shoplifting.

27:43.896 --> 27:49.700
Had no money, no food.
Manny found me.

27:49.702 --> 27:51.635
Taught me.

27:53.706 --> 27:57.941
Ooh, we did some crazy shit
back in the day.

28:00.379 --> 28:04.782
My favorite was when
we were low on cash.

28:04.784 --> 28:07.518
Manny would take me to a store.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.019
I'd go in first.

28:09.021 --> 28:13.524
He'd come in behind me
like he didn't know me.

28:13.526 --> 28:17.394
Put a gun to my head.

28:17.396 --> 28:19.396
Everyone would stop and stare

28:19.398 --> 28:22.132
at the skinny little
blonde girl.

28:22.134 --> 28:26.470
They'd try to save her
with their wallets.

28:28.941 --> 28:33.711
So what happened then?

28:33.713 --> 28:35.879
- Like, what do you mean?
- I mean, like,

28:35.881 --> 28:39.883
how did you go from being
so close with Manny

28:39.885 --> 28:41.952
to never seeing him again?

28:43.422 --> 28:46.523
Sometimes things go wrong, J.

28:46.525 --> 28:49.460
20 years wrong?

28:54.900 --> 28:57.968
Listen.

28:57.970 --> 29:02.172
You remember what they were all
saying about Manny at the end?

29:02.174 --> 29:04.308
The way he was,
laying in his bed,

29:04.310 --> 29:09.646
babblin' bullshit all day long?

29:09.648 --> 29:11.915
That ever happens to me,

29:11.917 --> 29:13.917
you put a bullet in my head.

29:13.919 --> 29:17.287
Okay.

29:19.125 --> 29:22.092
Swear!

29:22.094 --> 29:25.129
Say, "Grandma, that ever
happens to you",

29:25.131 --> 29:28.432
I'll put the bullet
in your head."

29:35.608 --> 29:39.843
I'll put a bullet in your head.

29:47.887 --> 29:50.587
Beautiful boy.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.393
What the hell is Smurf up to?

29:56.395 --> 29:58.228
She want you to move back
or somethin'?

29:58.230 --> 30:00.097
I'm not moving back.

30:00.099 --> 30:01.832
I'm not.

30:05.638 --> 30:08.272
Hey, does Nicky know
about this place?

30:08.274 --> 30:10.274
Yeah.

30:10.276 --> 30:11.809
All right, well, she'd better
keep her mouth shut.

30:11.811 --> 30:13.644
I don't want Smurf to know
till we open.

30:13.646 --> 30:16.280
Relax, man. I mean,
Smurf's gone somewhere,

30:16.282 --> 30:18.282
and I'll tell Nicky
not to say anything.

30:18.284 --> 30:19.750
And what's the matter
if Smurf knows?

30:19.752 --> 30:22.186
- She's gonna know eventually.
- Not till we open.

30:22.188 --> 30:24.321
'Cause when we open,
it'll be real,

30:24.323 --> 30:27.024
and it's gonna be mine,

30:27.026 --> 30:29.293
Not something she can take.

30:32.765 --> 30:35.299
Nicky again?

30:35.301 --> 30:37.734
I can't do this anymore.

30:37.736 --> 30:39.703
I'm gonna break up with Nicky.

30:39.705 --> 30:41.538
Rip the bandaid off.

30:41.540 --> 30:46.643
There you go. Should've done it
a while ago.

32:10.529 --> 32:12.095
I told you we'd find
something open.

32:14.967 --> 32:16.300
Go ahead and get us a seat.

32:16.302 --> 32:19.703
I gotta get something
from the truck.

32:42.928 --> 32:44.261
Thank you.

32:51.537 --> 32:54.938
Do exactly as I say and nobody's
gonna get hurt. Okay?

32:54.940 --> 32:57.274
Get the cash out
the register right now.

32:57.276 --> 32:59.176
Hurry up. Move your asses. Go.

32:59.178 --> 33:01.812
You. Take the bag.

33:01.814 --> 33:05.148
Everybody, get your phones
and your wallets out, okay?

33:05.150 --> 33:06.750
I want you to put it in the bag.

33:06.752 --> 33:09.686
Do exactly as I say,
and nobody's gonna get hurt.

33:09.688 --> 33:12.222
- Don't get any ideas.
- Come on. Let's go.

33:12.224 --> 33:14.424
You, you, you. Get everything
out. Put it in the bag.

33:14.426 --> 33:16.893
Let's go. Put it in there!
Come on! Sorry.

33:16.895 --> 33:20.330
You think I won't use this?
Get it in the bag.

33:20.332 --> 33:21.765
Let's go. Come on!

33:27.206 --> 33:28.505
- Whoo!
- Whoohoohoo!

33:28.507 --> 33:31.341
Let's go! Let's go!

33:32.144 --> 33:33.977
Go, go, go, go, go, now!

33:38.317 --> 33:41.218
Yes! Yes, baby! Yes.

33:41.220 --> 33:43.186
Whoo!

33:43.188 --> 33:44.955
Toss the phones!

33:46.592 --> 33:48.325
- Whoohoohoo!
- Aah!

33:53.799 --> 33:56.733
Aah! You crazy bastard.
In an opencarry state.

33:56.735 --> 33:59.436
You are one beautiful baby.

33:59.438 --> 34:02.005
You're a natural.
Not like the other boys.

34:02.007 --> 34:05.409
I had to teach them everything,
every single thing.

34:05.411 --> 34:08.411
You feel that rush? You feel it?

34:08.414 --> 34:10.147
- You feel the rush, baby?
- Yeah.

34:10.149 --> 34:14.684
You know what it feels like now?
Do you?

34:20.893 --> 34:23.793
You are fearless.

34:26.264 --> 34:28.231
Like you.

34:39.378 --> 34:42.879
We need to talk, Nicky.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.246
Yeah, we do.

34:44.248 --> 34:46.783
Yeah, okay, so...

34:46.784 --> 34:48.784
What did my dad do
with you guys?

34:48.786 --> 34:51.788
It had to do with
the base, didn't it?

34:51.790 --> 34:54.958
Pendleton? The last few months,
after my dad was, like,

34:54.960 --> 34:57.794
besties with Baz
for, like, a second.

34:57.796 --> 34:59.930
He got weird. Hardly sleeping.

34:59.932 --> 35:04.301
How much did you pay him?
I bet it was a lot.

35:04.303 --> 35:06.536
Yeah, okay.

35:06.538 --> 35:08.605
What if he did do
something with us?

35:08.607 --> 35:12.275
He's such a goddamn coward.

35:12.277 --> 35:15.946
I know that's why he left
and went to Guam.

35:18.183 --> 35:20.984
But I'm not a coward.

35:20.986 --> 35:24.221
The fire? If I wasn't there,
you'd be dead.

35:24.223 --> 35:26.590
If I didn't get rid of
the drugs, you'd be in jail.

35:26.592 --> 35:28.391
And you like it
when your dick's in my mouth,

35:28.393 --> 35:32.662
so you really need to stop
treating me like a little kid!

35:35.234 --> 35:36.867
All right.

35:40.005 --> 35:42.906
Okay, so what'd you want
to talk about?

35:49.848 --> 35:53.917
Just don't tell Smurf
about the bar, okay?

35:53.919 --> 35:56.520
Okay.

36:00.325 --> 36:02.726
You know, I'm tired and drunk,

36:02.728 --> 36:06.029
and I'd kind of like
to have sex.

36:16.208 --> 36:19.142
Me, too.

36:27.486 --> 36:30.887
Deran Cody?

36:30.889 --> 36:34.257
Yeah. Sir.

36:34.259 --> 36:35.759
Brian Mills.

36:35.761 --> 36:37.761
Nice to meet you.

36:37.763 --> 36:39.496
You got your work cut out
for you?

36:39.498 --> 36:43.033
Yeah.

36:43.035 --> 36:44.768
You ever own a business before?

36:44.770 --> 36:47.571
How'd you finance this?
Business loan?

36:47.573 --> 36:49.406
Savings.

36:49.408 --> 36:50.840
And where do you work?

36:50.842 --> 36:53.643
As a property manager
for my family's buildings.

36:53.645 --> 36:56.379
Your, your taxes show that?

36:56.381 --> 36:57.981
Yeah.

36:57.983 --> 37:02.586
Would this help for my 220?

37:02.588 --> 37:06.923
Sorry, I couldn't figure out
how to do the front page thing.

37:06.925 --> 37:09.659
But it, you know, basically kind
of lays out what I'm gonna do.

37:09.661 --> 37:11.461
No. I don't need that.

37:11.463 --> 37:13.730
Okay.

37:13.732 --> 37:16.266
But you know what the 220 is?

37:16.268 --> 37:18.868
It's the report
you're doing on me.

37:18.870 --> 37:21.104
You have done your research.

37:23.675 --> 37:25.475
I have a record.

37:25.477 --> 37:28.144
When I was 22, I stole a car,

37:28.146 --> 37:29.813
I did five months at East Mesa,

37:29.815 --> 37:32.849
a year probation and...

37:34.586 --> 37:36.820
Extenuating circumstances?

37:36.822 --> 37:39.823
Nobody made me do it, if that's
what you're asking.

37:39.825 --> 37:42.759
<i>Why did you do it?</i>

37:47.099 --> 37:50.166
When I was 18,
II surfed competitively,

37:50.168 --> 37:55.171
and, you know, I qualified
for the West Coast championship

37:55.173 --> 37:57.240
at Avalanche Beach.

37:57.242 --> 38:00.977
My family thought I really
had a shot, you know?

38:00.979 --> 38:03.980
My brother basically quit school
to drive me to competitions.

38:03.982 --> 38:05.982
And...

38:05.984 --> 38:10.020
I turned 20 and it looked
like I was gonna get sponsored,

38:10.022 --> 38:15.292
and then it kind of flamed out.

38:15.294 --> 38:17.127
After that, I didn't think
I'd have a shot

38:17.129 --> 38:20.930
at anything
on my own again, and...

38:20.932 --> 38:23.833
I just did a lot of stupid shit.

38:26.471 --> 38:27.771
So...

38:27.773 --> 38:30.907
You know what
moral turpitude is?

38:30.909 --> 38:35.345
I'm guessing it's not
a good thing.

38:35.347 --> 38:39.182
I have to assess the likelihood
of you committing acts of it.

38:44.890 --> 38:47.023
When we send inspectors,
we don't tell you.

38:47.025 --> 38:49.726
Everything by the book.

38:49.728 --> 38:51.361
Don't give me a reason
to turn you down.

38:51.363 --> 38:55.165
I won't. And thank you for
not giving me some story

38:55.167 --> 38:58.568
about being wrongly accused
or trying to bribe me.

38:58.570 --> 39:02.372
You wouldn't believe how many
people we turn down for that.

39:02.374 --> 39:04.841
No shit.

39:04.843 --> 39:07.010
- No shit.
- That's crazy.

39:11.717 --> 39:14.918
- Better get back to work.
- Yeah.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.119
- Yeah, I will.
- All right, be good.

39:16.121 --> 39:19.189
- Thank you, thank you.
- You bet.

39:50.789 --> 39:53.957
Come on, baby. Time to go home.

40:05.137 --> 40:08.838
<i>- This isn't how it should look.
- No.</i>

40:10.709 --> 40:13.009
Hey.

40:13.011 --> 40:16.379
- Hi.
- Ruby's okay?

40:16.381 --> 40:17.981
You didn't get my message?

40:17.983 --> 40:22.419
No. II didn't get it. Hey.

40:23.688 --> 40:27.123
Um, can we talk in private?

40:28.727 --> 40:32.295
- I'll just be a second, okay?
- Okay.

40:38.737 --> 40:40.003
You all right?

40:40.005 --> 40:42.839
Yeah, it's just, um...

40:45.076 --> 40:48.645
You might hear something
at the game about me.

40:48.647 --> 40:52.182
I have a son... Christopher.

40:52.184 --> 40:53.883
He's 8.

40:53.885 --> 40:58.421
I lost custody of him.

40:58.423 --> 41:02.859
I had an accident
with him in the car.

41:02.861 --> 41:05.161
I had been drinking.

41:06.698 --> 41:10.567
He was okay...

41:10.569 --> 41:14.938
Eventually, but, um...

41:14.940 --> 41:18.541
I'm still working
at forgiving myself.

41:20.445 --> 41:22.979
I just... I know how close
you are with Lena,

41:22.981 --> 41:28.251
so I understand if you
can't see past it.

41:34.125 --> 41:36.659
What happened to your hand?

41:36.661 --> 41:41.331
I burned myself.

41:49.107 --> 41:53.543
Lena's trying to make pancakes.

41:53.545 --> 41:56.045
I think...

41:56.047 --> 41:59.282
we should put the food out
that you brought.

42:12.430 --> 42:15.632
- What's up, Gia?
- Look who's here!

42:15.634 --> 42:18.601
- Bazzy boy.
- How's it goin'?

42:18.603 --> 42:21.371
- You're a sight for sore eyes.
- And you're lookin' good.

42:21.373 --> 42:23.072
And you know what to say.

42:23.074 --> 42:24.707
Well, that's true. How's it goin'?
All right.

42:24.709 --> 42:26.843
- You remember Monica?
- Yeah, of course.

42:26.845 --> 42:30.179
So... to what do I owe
the pleasure? Hi.

42:30.181 --> 42:31.514
A couple things.

42:31.516 --> 42:34.684
A friend of mine is
trying to sell this.

42:36.988 --> 42:38.421
Yeah.

42:38.423 --> 42:40.189
Take a look.

42:40.191 --> 42:41.824
She's better with emeralds.

42:41.826 --> 42:43.760
I know.

42:44.863 --> 42:48.464
Well, it's a beauty.
Very few inclusions.

42:48.466 --> 42:50.767
Patterns in the stones
that look like moss.

42:50.769 --> 42:52.402
Whoever cut this was skilled.

42:54.873 --> 42:56.673
What do you think
you can get for that?

42:56.675 --> 42:59.275
I don't know.
Have to make a few calls.

42:59.277 --> 43:03.012
- I'll let you know.
- Okay.

43:03.014 --> 43:06.082
I'm gonna have some credit card
numbers in a couple weeks.

43:06.084 --> 43:07.550
I'm thinking 300 to 400.

43:07.552 --> 43:09.953
Security codes,
solid credit limits.

43:09.955 --> 43:12.755
You can make some good money off of them.
Cards are risky.

43:12.757 --> 43:14.891
You've never had a problem
with credit cards before.

43:14.893 --> 43:18.795
What are you talkin' about? What's
the issue here? What am I missing?

43:21.933 --> 43:25.602
Smurf told you not to
work with us, didn't she?

43:25.604 --> 43:28.771
Gia, I thought you were
smarter than this.

43:28.773 --> 43:31.441
From here on in, who do you think
is gonna bring you more business?

43:31.443 --> 43:33.710
Who? Think about it.

43:33.712 --> 43:36.913
I can't help you, Baz.

44:03.308 --> 44:05.174
He's here.

44:05.176 --> 44:08.378
Remember what I told you. Don't talk
about the lady from the church.

44:08.380 --> 44:12.348
- Hello?
- He returns!

44:12.350 --> 44:14.517
- Daddy.
- Hey, sweetie. How are ya?

44:14.519 --> 44:16.819
How's it goin'? You're good?

44:16.821 --> 44:18.087
You have fun with Uncle Pope?

44:18.089 --> 44:20.423
Yeah, he's a fun guy, isn't he?

44:20.425 --> 44:22.025
Thanks for watching her.

44:22.027 --> 44:24.794
Can I talk to you outside
for a minute?

44:29.701 --> 44:31.734
Yeah.

44:31.736 --> 44:33.703
You weren't
pissing around in Mexico.

44:33.705 --> 44:35.838
No. Any of this stuff
gets left on site,

44:35.840 --> 44:37.573
it's better
I bought it over the border.

44:37.575 --> 44:41.577
It's less traceable.
But, man, we got a problem.

44:41.579 --> 44:43.579
I went by Gia's to talk
about the credit cards.

44:43.581 --> 44:45.181
Smurf got to her.

44:45.183 --> 44:47.283
I called Smurf's guy
in San Pedro, same thing.

44:47.285 --> 44:49.318
They will not do business
with us.

44:49.320 --> 44:50.853
A third of our take
at the church

44:50.855 --> 44:52.922
could be credit cards.
Yeah, no, shit. If not more.

44:52.924 --> 44:54.590
We're gonna have a small window
before they get reported.

44:54.592 --> 44:57.193
We need to have a buyer
in place that night.

44:57.195 --> 44:58.461
Find a new buyer.

44:58.463 --> 45:01.230
Pope, in two weeks?
Not happening.

45:02.734 --> 45:05.601
Gia was hustling antiques
on the strand

45:05.603 --> 45:07.170
before Smurf found her.

45:07.172 --> 45:11.240
<i>Smurf made Gia off of jobs
we pulled.</i>

45:11.242 --> 45:14.010
Maybe that's it.

45:14.012 --> 45:18.181
What? We don't find a
new fence, we make one.

45:24.556 --> 45:26.723
Hey, get in here, man.
We wanna be on schedule,

45:26.725 --> 45:28.958
we gotta get all these down
by the end of the night.

45:28.960 --> 45:32.095
Yeah. How'd it go with
the liquor inspector?

45:32.097 --> 45:35.331
- Good. Kinda. Yeah.
- Told you.

45:35.333 --> 45:37.066
Nothing that cash can't solve.

45:37.068 --> 45:40.069
Yeah.

45:40.071 --> 45:42.505
How'd Nicky take it?

45:42.507 --> 45:44.173
You broke up with her, right?

45:44.175 --> 45:46.776
Yeah..

45:46.778 --> 45:48.311
Didn't really go like that.

45:52.817 --> 45:57.954
Whatever, man.
She's a cool chick. That's all.

46:34.292 --> 46:35.892
Hey.

46:35.894 --> 46:39.162
- She left for the day.
- I'm not here to see Gia.

46:40.965 --> 46:42.832
You want me to talk to her?

46:42.834 --> 46:45.501
It won't work. No, I know
she won't listen to you.

46:45.503 --> 46:48.838
I see the way she talks to you.
Believe me, I get it.

46:48.840 --> 46:53.876
I was under Smurf's thumb
for 20 years. I get it.

46:54.712 --> 46:56.579
What do you want?

46:56.581 --> 46:58.447
Every time I come in here,

46:58.449 --> 47:00.049
you're the one
that does the work,

47:00.051 --> 47:01.984
which means,
you know the buyers.

47:01.986 --> 47:04.720
No, I, I've been
with Gia a long time and...

47:04.722 --> 47:07.723
Yeah, and I was loyal
to Smurf, too.

47:07.725 --> 47:09.892
Look where it got me.

47:09.894 --> 47:11.294
But then, maybe Gia's different.

47:11.296 --> 47:13.462
Maybe she has your best
interests at heart.

47:15.133 --> 47:19.268
Look, in two weeks, I'm gonna
have 400 credit card numbers.

47:19.270 --> 47:22.071
You know someone that
can handle that?
