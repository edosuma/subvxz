00:13.801 --> 00:18.000
To the new year.
may it be better than last year.

00:18.067 --> 00:20.501
Ahh! i know it will be.

00:22.067 --> 00:26.200
Carlos, i need you to bring
negotiations to a close.

00:28.434 --> 00:29.101
Not a problem, mr. greene.

00:29.134 --> 00:32.333
Mark and i
will take care of it.

00:34.467 --> 00:35.734
Hey, how you doin', man?

00:35.801 --> 00:36.967
How you doin', carlos?

00:37.001 --> 00:38.134
Good. good.

00:38.168 --> 00:39.901
So, uh, can we, uh,
talk about the deal.

00:39.967 --> 00:41.667
Of course. just follow me.

00:45.001 --> 00:48.767
So i, uh, had a chance
to take a look
at the numbers.

00:48.834 --> 00:50.834
Ohh!

00:53.434 --> 00:56.767
Mr. greene's proposal
wasn't a request, nick.

00:56.801 --> 00:59.701
Yes, but feel free to take
as much time as you need
to think about it.

00:59.767 --> 01:01.200
Uhh!

01:01.267 --> 01:02.200

01:18.634 --> 01:21.001
So i sign this
and i'm good, right?

01:21.068 --> 01:24.233
As long as you testify,
you'll have total immunity,

01:24.300 --> 01:26.534
With new identities for you,
your wife, and kids.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.333
What about kimi?

01:28.400 --> 01:30.367
Come on, mark.
i can't put your mistress
in witness protection.

01:30.434 --> 01:31.934
Just like i told my wife,

01:32.001 --> 01:33.333
I'm not leaving kimi.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.400
Elliot greene's
not a forgiving man.

01:35.467 --> 01:38.867
You don't sign,
we cut you loose.

02:23.300 --> 02:23.833
What?

02:23.900 --> 02:24.967
Get away from
the bloody window.

02:25.034 --> 02:26.568
What's going on?
why?

02:26.634 --> 02:28.568
A sniper just killed
mark mclaughlin

02:28.634 --> 02:30.334
While he was in
protective custody.

02:30.401 --> 02:32.000
Is he someone
from one of our cases?

02:32.067 --> 02:35.100
No, no, no, no.
he was a case
reynolds was working

02:35.167 --> 02:36.267
Before he came here.

02:36.334 --> 02:39.067
All right, lightman,
don't say another word, ok?

02:39.134 --> 02:40.733
Mclaughlin was reynolds'
running buddy

02:40.800 --> 02:41.900
In an assortment
of crimes, right?

02:41.967 --> 02:44.568
You're not supposed to know
anything about that.

02:44.601 --> 02:46.201
You work here.
i know everything.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.067
Does somebody
want to fill me in?

02:48.100 --> 02:50.000
Reynolds was undercover
for 2 years

02:50.067 --> 02:52.601
Trying to dismantle
elliot greene's
organization in new york.

02:52.668 --> 02:54.401
Yep.
greene, the wall street guy?

02:54.434 --> 02:55.401
Yeah.

02:55.434 --> 02:57.000
Mobster, killer, extortionist.

02:57.067 --> 02:59.434
Mark was the lead witness
in the case against greene.

02:59.501 --> 03:01.267
Yeah, now he's dead.

03:01.334 --> 03:03.401
Reynolds is the next
in line to testify.

03:03.434 --> 03:05.668
The u.s. attorney's on his
way over. wants to put you
into protective custody.

03:05.733 --> 03:08.100
You sound like you have
a problem with that.

03:08.167 --> 03:10.501
Yeah, i do. they
got a spotty track
record at best.

03:10.568 --> 03:12.534
Would you bet your life
they could keep you
safe out there?

03:12.601 --> 03:13.967
No, i didn't think so.

03:14.034 --> 03:16.067
All right, so what
do you have in mind?

03:16.134 --> 03:17.934
Follow me.

03:21.234 --> 03:22.800
Hi. you're the u.s.
attorney, right?

03:22.867 --> 03:25.733
Garrett denning.
where's agent reynolds?

03:25.800 --> 03:27.434
He's in the loo.

03:27.467 --> 03:29.401
Uh, this is foster.

03:34.967 --> 03:37.634
Why is he in there?
we have to move now.

03:37.700 --> 03:41.100
Well, 'cause your last witness
got his head blown off.

03:41.134 --> 03:42.501
And he works here.
my office, my rules.

03:42.568 --> 03:43.967
You're way out of line.

03:44.034 --> 03:46.301
Now, he is my new lead
witness, and he's
leaving with me.

03:46.367 --> 03:47.800
Right. well, that's
bulletproof glass,

03:47.867 --> 03:50.601
That's reinforced door.
he stays until i put in
the code.

03:50.634 --> 03:52.100
So you're holding
him prisoner.

03:52.134 --> 03:53.267
Hostage.

03:53.301 --> 03:57.201
I'll release him
if my demands are met.

04:01.700 --> 04:04.934
Ryan star: * dream,

www.addic7ed.com

04:27.434 --> 04:30.833
Give me agent reynolds now
or i will have your company
shut down

04:30.900 --> 04:32.601
And charge you with
obstruction of justice.

04:32.668 --> 04:34.000
Oh, well, that's not
gonna get him out of there.

04:34.267 --> 04:36.000
We are all concerned
about reynolds' safety,

04:36.033 --> 04:37.667
So let's just try
to work out a deal.

04:37.701 --> 04:39.401
Oh, you have
a list of demands, do you?

04:39.467 --> 04:43.000
Yeah. secure our building
until we know he's safe.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.467
That's unnecessary.

04:44.534 --> 04:47.267
U.s. marshals are fully capable
of protecting agent reynolds.

04:47.334 --> 04:49.167
You don't sound too sure
about that.

04:49.200 --> 04:50.734
The only ones i don't trust
were the 3 guarding mclaughlin.

04:50.801 --> 04:52.000
Only they knew
where he was going.

04:52.033 --> 04:54.434
My office is conducting
an investigation

04:54.501 --> 04:55.567
Into those marshals.

04:55.634 --> 04:57.334
Yeah. you give them
to me,

04:57.401 --> 04:59.467
And then i'll let
reynolds go.
his life's in danger.

04:59.534 --> 05:02.801
You ask him who he trusts
to get to the bottom
of this, you or us?

05:04.900 --> 05:08.200
You were the only ones
who knew the safe house
location.

05:08.234 --> 05:10.100
One of you gave up
your witness.

05:10.167 --> 05:11.933
It's not possible.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.667
If there was someone
dirty on my team...

05:13.734 --> 05:16.000
They all flash fear when
they hear elliot greene's name.

05:16.067 --> 05:17.701
What did this guy do?

05:17.734 --> 05:20.033
He was a wall street fixer.

05:20.067 --> 05:23.200
If a hedge fund was looking
for inside information,

05:23.267 --> 05:25.134
Greene's people did
whatever it took
to get it for them.

05:25.167 --> 05:26.501
What did it normally take?

05:26.567 --> 05:27.801
Blackmail, kidnapping,

05:27.834 --> 05:29.933
Torture, murder.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.300
Our identities
were kept secret,

05:31.367 --> 05:33.167
Even from each other.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.200
Which one of you
did greene get to?

05:35.267 --> 05:38.467
The u.s. marshals
don't hire turncoats.

05:39.634 --> 05:41.033
Uh, just a minute.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.534
Can i borrow you?

05:48.701 --> 05:51.234
All right,
this gentleman here

05:51.300 --> 05:53.634
Is from the u.s.
attorney's office,

05:53.701 --> 05:56.200
And it is his job to put
whichever one of you 3

05:56.267 --> 05:58.868
Killed mclaughlin, in prison.

06:05.367 --> 06:08.134
Right, well, you two,
ok, go on.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.401
Out. go on.

06:11.768 --> 06:13.334
I want to talk to you.

06:13.401 --> 06:15.200
What did i do?

06:15.267 --> 06:17.401
Well, those two were scared
they might be working with

06:17.467 --> 06:18.501
Someone connected to greene.

06:18.567 --> 06:20.334
Only you showed
additional fear

06:20.401 --> 06:22.367
When you were threatened
with jail time.

06:22.434 --> 06:25.134
So what did greene do?
did he pay you off?

06:27.067 --> 06:28.200
Did he threaten your family?

06:28.267 --> 06:29.534
No.

06:29.601 --> 06:31.134
Something else.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.868
What, did you simply
not like mclaughlin?

06:33.933 --> 06:37.033
Mark was an obnoxious
lowlife and scumbag,

06:37.100 --> 06:39.134
But i didn't want him dead.

06:47.467 --> 06:48.401
Hey.

06:48.467 --> 06:50.534
Keep an eye on him,
all right?

06:50.601 --> 06:53.300
What does that mean?
we question the marshal

06:53.334 --> 06:55.100
Or wait for lightman
to come back?

06:55.167 --> 06:56.167
Hmm. i don't know.

06:56.234 --> 06:58.667
But i'm sure
it's some kind of test.

07:00.234 --> 07:01.601
So is that our guy or not?

07:01.667 --> 07:04.401
Uh, what can you tell me
about the case
now mclaughlin's dead?

07:04.467 --> 07:05.933
Well, his death
is a disaster.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.501
I have to restructure
my entire approach
to the trial.

07:08.567 --> 07:10.534
And without reynolds,
i don't have a case.

07:10.601 --> 07:13.167
Does his voice sound
like his face looks
to you?

07:13.200 --> 07:15.300
There was a distinct
upturn in his vocal pitch

07:15.367 --> 07:17.868
When he mentioned
mclaughlin's death.

07:17.933 --> 07:19.234
Did you have him killed?

07:19.300 --> 07:21.167
That's absurd.
he was our lead witness.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.534
Yeah, but he was
at a meeting with you

07:22.601 --> 07:23.868
Just before
he was murdered, right?

07:23.933 --> 07:26.134
You knew the exact
place and time
he was being moved.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.167
Well, of course.
i'm an assistant u.s.
attorney, for god's sake.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.734
And yet you're happy
he's dead.

07:29.801 --> 07:31.967
Oh, it makes sense.
he had a rap sheet
a mile long,

07:32.033 --> 07:34.467
And he only cut a deal
with you because you
had him by the throat.

07:34.534 --> 07:36.100
I mean, if it was me,

07:36.167 --> 07:38.933
I would much prefer
a highly decorated fbi
agent as a witness.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.967
Did you have
mark mclaughlin killed?

07:41.033 --> 07:42.300
Are you people on drugs?

07:42.367 --> 07:44.834
Did you have any idea
he was about to be murdered?

07:44.900 --> 07:46.634
Absolutely not.

07:48.567 --> 07:49.801
That's the truth.

07:49.868 --> 07:52.067
Thank you. now get back
in there with that marshal.

07:52.334 --> 07:54.601
He's a puppet.
i'm much more interested

07:54.667 --> 07:56.300
In the guy who's pulling
the strings.

07:56.367 --> 07:59.434
You want me to get you
in front of elliot greene?

07:59.500 --> 08:01.001
Yeah. absolutely.

08:01.068 --> 08:03.667
If you want the truth.

08:06.133 --> 08:07.100
[velcro rips]

08:07.167 --> 08:09.034
This'll tell you
if i have swine flu?

08:09.100 --> 08:11.801
Nah. nah.

08:11.867 --> 08:15.434
It's a prerequisite
for a body cavity search.

08:17.367 --> 08:19.233
I'm kidding.

08:19.300 --> 08:21.133
Just kidding, mr. greene.

08:22.133 --> 08:24.734
So, how are we
feeling today?

08:24.801 --> 08:25.734
Fine, i guess.

08:25.834 --> 08:26.667
What, just fine?

08:26.734 --> 08:28.534
It's not every day
the lead witness

08:28.601 --> 08:30.467
In a case against you
gets killed, is it?

08:32.100 --> 08:33.833
Who are you?

08:33.900 --> 08:35.567
I'm a friend of the witness
that's about to step in

08:35.634 --> 08:37.001
To keep you behind bars.

08:37.068 --> 08:39.001
I'm also a doctor.

08:39.068 --> 08:41.333
And you're entitled
to a lawyer.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.767
Don't need one.

08:43.801 --> 08:47.367
Tell me, how'd you
get to mclaughlin?

08:47.434 --> 08:51.500
Did you pay off
one of the marshals?

08:51.567 --> 08:53.701
Did you threaten him?

08:53.767 --> 08:56.167
Someone higher up
the food chain, then?

08:56.233 --> 08:58.767
No, it's not that either.

08:58.834 --> 09:00.467
It is funny, isn't it?

09:00.534 --> 09:02.701
A man gets killed,
today you're facing
another murder count.

09:02.767 --> 09:04.068
That's funny.

09:04.100 --> 09:05.567
Tell your friends
i'm confident

09:05.601 --> 09:07.434
I'll be cleared
at trial.

09:09.001 --> 09:12.001
You believe that, don't you?

09:12.068 --> 09:14.500
I have nothing to fear.

09:14.567 --> 09:16.334
You think you can
kill my friend?

09:16.400 --> 09:17.901
Who's your friend?

09:17.934 --> 09:20.667
The man i know as carlos?
benjamin reynolds, right?

09:20.734 --> 09:22.500
If you think
that federal agent

09:22.567 --> 09:25.500
Is gonna be the guy
who's gonna take me down,

09:25.567 --> 09:28.801
Ask him about
his old friend scotty.

09:30.467 --> 09:31.534
What's up?

09:31.601 --> 09:33.634
I just had
a very interesting chat

09:33.701 --> 09:35.367
With your friend
elliot greene.

09:35.434 --> 09:37.767
He says he has no intention
of harming you.

09:37.834 --> 09:39.667
Yeah, well, forgive me
if i don't believe him.

09:39.734 --> 09:42.767
Do you have any idea
why he's not the slightest bit
worried about your testimony?

09:42.834 --> 09:45.100
Half of what i know
could send him away
for life.

09:45.167 --> 09:48.300
Does the name scotty
mean anything to you?

09:50.701 --> 09:52.734
There it is.

09:52.801 --> 09:54.634
There it is.

09:56.534 --> 09:58.500
Let me see that case file.

10:02.734 --> 10:04.367
What are you looking for?

10:16.667 --> 10:18.100
Ok, there.

10:19.500 --> 10:20.667
What is that?

10:20.701 --> 10:22.200
Can we quit screwing
around here?

10:22.267 --> 10:23.867
Greene's trial
is in 4 days.

10:23.934 --> 10:25.667
Yeah, well, that's
not gonna matter,

10:25.701 --> 10:28.701
Because you're gonna have to
make your case without me.

10:28.767 --> 10:30.467
Without you,
i don't have a case.

10:30.534 --> 10:31.834
Just use the surveillance tapes.

10:31.901 --> 10:33.200
That should be enough.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.233
You're my witness
who authenticates the tapes

10:35.300 --> 10:36.567
And nails the guy.

10:36.634 --> 10:37.701
And as a federal agent,
you know,

10:37.734 --> 10:39.400
You really don't have
a choice in the matter.

10:39.467 --> 10:40.934
I do have a choice.

10:41.001 --> 10:43.834
You sacrificed
2 years of your life
to build this case.

10:43.901 --> 10:44.767
Hey?

10:44.834 --> 10:47.434
And now i'm done
sacrificing.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.934
If you don't take the stand,
you'll be fired from the fbi

10:50.001 --> 10:51.467
And we will press charges
against you.

10:51.534 --> 10:53.567
I'm not testifying.

10:53.634 --> 10:55.367
You can't do that.

10:56.334 --> 10:58.434
Watch me.

10:58.500 --> 11:00.567
I've seen that face before.

11:06.051 --> 11:08.250
You need to call me back
as soon as you get this.

11:08.267 --> 11:09.767
I've got a big problem here.

11:09.801 --> 11:11.701
Call me on my cell phone
as soon as you get
to the office.

11:15.467 --> 11:16.501
Have you lost your mind?

11:16.567 --> 11:17.567
You know, that's funny,

11:17.600 --> 11:20.234
'cause i was about to ask you
the same question.

11:20.767 --> 11:21.734
Why are you doing this to me?

11:22.101 --> 11:25.034
Look, lightman,
i get it, ok?

11:25.101 --> 11:27.101
You're concerned
and i appreciate that.

11:27.134 --> 11:28.867
But you really need
to back off, ok?

11:28.934 --> 11:31.267
I'm the man that's
keeping you safe.

11:31.333 --> 11:34.400
You know what this is?
this is just another one
of your ego trips.

11:34.467 --> 11:36.200
You can't rest
until you find out

11:36.233 --> 11:38.667
What i've been keeping
from you.

11:38.701 --> 11:40.168
No, it's not about me.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.134
No, it's about the pain
you're feeling, right now.

11:42.168 --> 11:44.801
Oh, so you just
see it all, huh?

11:44.834 --> 11:47.400
But, see, you have
no idea. none.

11:47.467 --> 11:49.400
I've had to make a few
brutal choices in the past

11:49.467 --> 11:50.801
To arrive at the right outcome.

11:50.834 --> 11:52.134
Hey, let me tell you
something.

11:52.168 --> 11:54.134
When i was undercover
on the greene case,

11:54.168 --> 11:55.233
My father, he died.

11:55.300 --> 11:57.233
I didn't go
to the hospital.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.400
Or the funeral.

11:58.467 --> 12:00.168
So don't talk to me
about tough choices.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.734
Well, then testify.

12:02.801 --> 12:04.200
Go on, then.

12:04.233 --> 12:07.801
Make the sacrifice
count for something.

12:07.867 --> 12:10.500
Just--just shut up
and give me my phone.

12:12.667 --> 12:14.068
Who were you calling?

12:14.101 --> 12:15.867
Sheila radotti. who's she?

12:15.901 --> 12:17.701
She was my handler
on the case.

12:17.734 --> 12:20.267
Oh, yeah? does she know
why you won't testify?

12:20.333 --> 12:22.101
I haven't spoken
to her in months.

12:24.934 --> 12:26.867
Oh, so, i get it.

12:26.901 --> 12:28.567
So you're investigating
me for them.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.934
Yep. yeah.

12:31.001 --> 12:32.667
To keep you from getting
dragged out of here.

12:32.701 --> 12:34.467
Yeah, funny you didn't
mention that up front.

12:34.534 --> 12:36.467
Just trying to get
to the truth, ben.

12:36.534 --> 12:37.567
Yeah.

12:37.600 --> 12:40.034
And i bet you'll
serve me up to get it.

12:48.701 --> 12:49.634
Hey.

12:49.701 --> 12:51.233
Hey.

12:51.267 --> 12:53.200
Is there anything
in the case file
from reynolds' handler?

12:53.233 --> 12:54.801
Sheila radotti.

12:54.867 --> 12:57.233
Yeah, yeah.
she wrote most of it.

12:57.267 --> 13:00.233
The language suggest
she's, uh, intelligent,

13:00.267 --> 13:02.567
Meticulous, and, uh,

13:02.600 --> 13:04.734
Emotionally attached
to reynolds.

13:04.767 --> 13:07.034
You think he was
shagging his boss?

13:07.934 --> 13:10.001
Well...

13:10.068 --> 13:12.934
I can't confirm that
from the case file,

13:12.967 --> 13:15.600
But her feelings for him
run deep.

13:15.634 --> 13:17.701
I wonder if he feels
the same way.

13:17.767 --> 13:19.767
What, do you think
he's trying to protect her?

13:19.801 --> 13:22.068
He's protecting someone.

13:24.134 --> 13:25.600
That's it. i'm going in.

13:25.634 --> 13:28.101
No. lightman will be furious
that you interfered.

13:28.134 --> 13:30.233
I'm gonna go find out
what he wants.

13:30.267 --> 13:34.267
No. then he'll be angry
that we didn't take
the initiative sooner.

13:35.434 --> 13:37.300
Well, if i'm gonna get
yelled at no matter what,

13:37.333 --> 13:39.101
I might as well
get in the game.

13:39.134 --> 13:40.667
You coming?

13:43.300 --> 13:45.667
Describe the events
of this morning.

13:45.701 --> 13:49.200
I woke up at 5:15 a.m.

13:49.267 --> 13:52.068
I took a shower.
i got dressed.

13:52.134 --> 13:54.101
Interested in what i did
in the john?

13:54.134 --> 13:56.168
Loker: why don't we
skip ahead to after that?

13:56.200 --> 13:58.901
I woke mark up and i took him
to his meeting

13:58.967 --> 14:00.001
With the u.s. attorney.

14:00.034 --> 14:01.567
Whoa, whoa, you skipped
some steps there.

14:01.634 --> 14:02.901
What happened between
waking him up

14:02.967 --> 14:04.333
And taking him
out of the safe house?

14:04.367 --> 14:06.467
The usual. he got ready
and we left.

14:06.500 --> 14:09.734
Well, did he brush his
teeth? did he shower?
talk us through it.

14:09.801 --> 14:11.967
I wasn't with him
in the bathroom.

14:14.801 --> 14:16.500
You screwed up.

14:16.534 --> 14:18.934
When mark was in
the bathroom,
what did you do?

14:19.001 --> 14:20.867
Who do you tnk you are, huh?

14:20.901 --> 14:23.333
I've been decorated 3 times
in the line of duty.

14:23.367 --> 14:26.233
But you made a mistake
this morning.
so what was it?

14:26.300 --> 14:29.701
Tell us or your
career ends today.

14:29.734 --> 14:32.600
We can see to that.

14:32.667 --> 14:35.101
I could hear mark
talking in the bathroom

14:35.168 --> 14:37.767
And i caught him
using the cell phone.

14:37.801 --> 14:39.101
He wasn't supposed
to have one.

14:39.134 --> 14:41.333
And i'm guessing
you didn't report it.

14:41.367 --> 14:44.600
I tossed it.
i didn't think it would
compromise our security.

14:44.634 --> 14:47.267
Tell us where
you ditched the phone.

14:49.467 --> 14:51.867
Special agent radotti?

14:51.901 --> 14:54.233
Gillian foster.
i've left you
a few messages.

14:54.300 --> 14:56.500
Oh, right. i'm sorry
i haven't gotten back to you.

14:56.534 --> 14:59.134
I'm on my way to a briefing
on the hill and i'm kind of
in a hurry.

14:59.168 --> 15:01.068
No problem.
i'll walk with you.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.168
I really need to talk
about agent reynolds.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.801
I can't discuss any of
the details of the greene case.

15:05.834 --> 15:09.467
Well, i'm more concerned
about why he's refusing
to testify.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.600
I wish i could help you,
but we haven't spoken
since he was reassigned,

15:12.667 --> 15:14.101
And they didn't even
tell me where.

15:14.168 --> 15:16.200
You were his only lifeline
to the outside world

15:16.233 --> 15:17.534
When he was undercover.

15:17.567 --> 15:18.967
You must have
some insights.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.400
I just found out
that he's refusing to testify,

15:21.467 --> 15:23.367
And it shocked me.
it's not like him.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.667
He's a model agent.
the gold standard.

15:25.701 --> 15:27.168
Model agent, gold standard.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.667
You're lavishing all sorts
of praise on him,

15:28.701 --> 15:31.233
But you don't act
very concerned.

15:31.267 --> 15:33.767
Let me clue you in
about what it's like

15:33.834 --> 15:35.867
For people to work
together undercover.

15:35.901 --> 15:38.168
I've counseled agents
after they've completed
undercover assignments.

15:38.200 --> 15:41.068
Well, then you should understand
that there's a very strong bond

15:41.101 --> 15:42.400
Between ben and me.

15:42.434 --> 15:44.734
I do not want to see him
ruined or in prison.

15:44.767 --> 15:46.734
Well, then you should
want him to testify.

15:48.534 --> 15:50.734
To get in with greene's
organization,

15:50.767 --> 15:54.333
Ben was authorized to commit
minor crimes to play the role
of a criminal.

15:54.367 --> 15:57.867
He assaulted people,
made threats, used narcotics.

15:57.901 --> 15:59.300
I've been there.

15:59.367 --> 16:02.934
Even if you're authorized
to break the law,
it changes you.

16:02.967 --> 16:05.300
How did it change reynolds?

16:05.367 --> 16:07.701
He was authorized to use drugs,
not abuse them.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.467
And if he testifies,
it'll all come out.

16:12.068 --> 16:14.367
We have reason to believe
someone named scotty

16:14.400 --> 16:16.001
Is keeping him
off the stand.

16:16.068 --> 16:17.834
Scotty villarosa?

16:17.901 --> 16:19.534
Is that someone
reynolds used drugs with?

16:19.567 --> 16:20.701
Among other things.

16:20.734 --> 16:23.367
When we swept up
greene's crew,

16:23.400 --> 16:25.200
We never found scotty.

16:25.233 --> 16:26.534
He just disappeared.

16:26.567 --> 16:28.233
Got away.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.200
We could really
use your help

16:31.267 --> 16:32.567
Back at my office.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.101
And reynolds
really needs a friend.

16:35.134 --> 16:36.467
Can you come down
and talk to him?

16:36.534 --> 16:40.500
Anything for ben.
i'll head over
after the briefing.

16:40.567 --> 16:43.534
Well, i don't think
that they're
romantically involved.

16:43.567 --> 16:44.801
She cares for him.

16:44.867 --> 16:47.333
Well, she paints a pretty ugly
picture with her words,

16:47.400 --> 16:49.134
So what did you see?

16:49.200 --> 16:51.034
The whole drug thing
with reynolds--
does it bother you?

16:51.068 --> 16:54.400
Does it unsettle you?
is it flashback
to your ex-husband?

16:54.434 --> 16:57.333
If--if i'm upset,
it's because this just
got twice as complicated.

16:57.400 --> 17:00.101
Me being married to alec
gave me insights

17:00.134 --> 17:01.500
Into how addicts can lead
double lives.

17:01.567 --> 17:03.667
Don't read me.
you're supposed to
be reading her.

17:03.734 --> 17:05.567
Oh. sorry, love.

17:05.599 --> 17:08.167
Well, um, that was alec,
this is reynolds.

17:08.233 --> 17:11.001
Who is refusing to testify
in order to protect himself.

17:11.068 --> 17:12.167
According to her.

17:12.233 --> 17:13.434
But protect himself
from what?

17:13.467 --> 17:14.500
I don't know.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.001
Well, maybe
we don't know reynolds

17:16.068 --> 17:17.666
As well as we thought we did.

17:19.434 --> 17:21.500
Don't throw your career away
like this.

17:23.068 --> 17:24.001
All right.

17:24.068 --> 17:25.500
Everybody out.
go on.

17:25.567 --> 17:27.901
This is my investigation.

17:27.934 --> 17:30.667
Out you go. go on.

17:30.734 --> 17:31.667
Go on.

17:31.734 --> 17:33.001
Thanks for your help.

17:35.300 --> 17:38.801
Oh, don't--don't do that.
don't try it.

17:38.834 --> 17:41.967
I'm onto you.

17:42.001 --> 17:43.400
Really?
yeah.

17:43.467 --> 17:45.034
Well, if that's true,
you should see
how pointless it is

17:45.101 --> 17:46.901
For you to keep coming
at me like that.

17:46.967 --> 17:48.967
See, you're wrestling
with something that
you can't live with.

17:49.001 --> 17:49.967
Been there, done that.

17:50.001 --> 17:51.001
Look, lightman,
just stop, ok?

17:51.034 --> 17:53.567
I've interrogated
more suspects than you.

17:53.634 --> 17:54.634
Oh, you think so?

17:54.667 --> 17:55.634
Yeah, i know so.

17:55.667 --> 17:57.267
And i know
all the mind games.

17:57.300 --> 17:59.134
Wrong again.
i don't need mind games
when i got the truth.

17:59.168 --> 18:01.300
The truth? really?
enlighten me.

18:01.333 --> 18:03.567
You were a cokehead.

18:04.634 --> 18:08.934
Prone to mood swings
and violence.

18:08.967 --> 18:11.967
Foster spoke
to your handler.

18:16.467 --> 18:18.734
I was doing my job.

18:18.801 --> 18:20.834
I hear you liked doing drugs.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.967
I hear you liked
being a criminal.

18:23.001 --> 18:25.034
Bit of a rush, right?

18:25.101 --> 18:27.734
I was getting close enough
to greene to make my case.
that's it.

18:27.801 --> 18:30.667
No, there's more to it
than that. i think
you miss those days.

18:30.701 --> 18:32.434
That's why you won't testify.

18:32.467 --> 18:33.801
You're wrong.

18:33.834 --> 18:36.767
Yeah, i think you're afraid.
you're afraid that everyone's

18:36.801 --> 18:38.701
Gonna see the coke-snorting
whoremonger

18:38.767 --> 18:41.200
You've been trying so hard
to bury.

18:41.267 --> 18:42.634
You better back off now.

18:42.667 --> 18:46.134
Yeah, your handler said your
time undercover changed you.

18:46.168 --> 18:47.233
I don't think
you changed at all.

18:47.300 --> 18:48.300
I think that's what
you really are.

18:48.333 --> 18:49.267
I think you're afraid

18:49.333 --> 18:50.534
Everyone's gonna see that.

18:50.567 --> 18:51.701
You want to talk about me?

18:51.734 --> 18:53.734
Yeah.

18:53.801 --> 18:55.667
Do you know i read
your file, too, lightman?

18:55.701 --> 18:56.967
Northern ireland.

18:57.001 --> 18:58.667
Hoabout
we talk about that?

18:59.867 --> 19:02.034
I'm not the one
heading off to jail.

19:02.101 --> 19:03.801
Yeah, well,
you should be.

19:03.834 --> 19:07.934
Some of the crap
you were involved in
over there.

19:09.567 --> 19:10.567
You know...

19:10.600 --> 19:12.867
There's still time
to step up

19:12.934 --> 19:14.300
And be the good boy
in all this.

19:14.333 --> 19:17.467
It's too late
for a change now.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.667
It doesn't have to be.

19:29.434 --> 19:31.134
What's in the case file, ben?

19:31.168 --> 19:35.001
What was it that
surprised you so much?

19:38.867 --> 19:41.233
You helped me out with
some serious trouble

19:41.300 --> 19:43.967
With my friend terry.

19:44.001 --> 19:46.967
I might be able
to repay the favor.

19:47.001 --> 19:49.233
My office.

19:49.300 --> 19:52.367
No cameras.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.667
Who's scotty?

20:03.667 --> 20:07.034
You know,
you make one mistake...

20:07.068 --> 20:09.600
And any other day
it wouldn't even matter.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.967
Who is he?

20:12.001 --> 20:14.600
You know, people who are
supposed to have your back,

20:14.667 --> 20:17.101
They just...

20:17.168 --> 20:19.367
They just leave you hanging.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.667
Did he betray you?

20:23.267 --> 20:27.967
Scotty villarosa was
another one of greene's guys.

20:28.034 --> 20:29.168
I worked with him.

20:29.200 --> 20:31.333
Did he threaten you?

20:31.367 --> 20:33.767
He can't ever get to me.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.233
You seem pretty certain
of that.

20:39.068 --> 20:40.867
Why?

20:43.500 --> 20:45.701
Because i killed scotty.

20:46.867 --> 20:49.600
Shot him dead.

20:55.801 --> 20:56.701
You killed scotty villarosa?

20:58.268 --> 21:02.167
I mean, was it
self-defense or...

21:03.600 --> 21:04.800
Yeah.

21:06.934 --> 21:07.867
He was my first one.

21:09.934 --> 21:11.000
I never shot
a person before.

21:14.001 --> 21:16.634
And you think that
he'd just fall back
and be dead instantly,

21:16.667 --> 21:18.368
But no, he--
he held on.

21:20.433 --> 21:21.934
He just stood there,

21:22.001 --> 21:23.834
Watching me as he died.

21:24.901 --> 21:26.533
Why'd you kill him?

21:26.600 --> 21:29.600
Just wrong place,
wrong time, i guess.

21:29.667 --> 21:31.134
We were in his apartment.
i went to the intercom

21:33.567 --> 21:38.634
My wire started futzing out,
making noises.

21:38.667 --> 21:42.701
And i tried to cover it up,
i tried to explain
to him, but...

21:42.768 --> 21:44.067
I was busted.

21:44.134 --> 21:47.334
So, scotty finds your wire,

21:47.401 --> 21:49.434
And he pulled his gun on you.

21:52.100 --> 21:54.634
Tell me he pulled a gun
on you.

21:56.601 --> 21:58.234
[sigh]

21:59.434 --> 22:02.200
He had this look
on his face.

22:02.267 --> 22:04.300
And i knew he had a gun.

22:04.367 --> 22:07.467
But i had the drop on him,
and i warned his dumb ass

22:07.534 --> 22:08.967
And he still tried to...

22:09.033 --> 22:11.100
[sighs]

22:11.167 --> 22:13.367
So that was that.

22:13.434 --> 22:15.134
I took the wire off my body,
put it on scotty's,

22:15.200 --> 22:18.234
Made him look like the rat
to greene.

22:19.067 --> 22:20.634
I was in after that.

22:20.700 --> 22:23.100
You know, killing scotty
was the best thing

22:23.167 --> 22:25.900
That ever happened to me
on this case.

22:25.967 --> 22:28.000
You've covered this up
the whole time?

22:28.067 --> 22:29.534
Hell, no. as soon
as i got a chance,
i called sheila

22:29.568 --> 22:31.000
And i told her everything.

22:31.067 --> 22:32.634
She told me
to stay on the case

22:32.700 --> 22:34.034
And that she would handle it.

22:34.101 --> 22:35.234
And you took her
at her word?

22:35.268 --> 22:36.700
Yes, i did.
because the very next day,

22:36.734 --> 22:38.967
She said headquarters
signed off on the shooting

22:39.000 --> 22:41.334
She even had me sign
an incident report.

22:41.401 --> 22:43.800
But it's not
in the case file now.

22:43.833 --> 22:45.634
So don't you understand?
i'll be discredited

22:45.668 --> 22:47.668
As a witness
and greene will walk.

22:47.734 --> 22:50.800
You'll get done
for murder.

22:50.833 --> 22:52.034
Exactly.

22:52.100 --> 22:54.100
Now you see why
i can't testify.

22:54.167 --> 22:57.100
'cause either way,
i'm screwed.

22:58.933 --> 23:01.000
Yeah. yeah, you are.

23:01.067 --> 23:03.900
Radotti uses you and you
just roll over, right?

23:03.967 --> 23:05.933
And, you know, you let
greene have another go
at you, is that it?

23:06.000 --> 23:08.401
Are you just gonna
give it up without a fuss?

23:08.467 --> 23:09.467
Excuse me?

23:09.501 --> 23:11.267
You heard me.
i mean, it's pathetic.

23:11.334 --> 23:14.634
I can't believe i've wasted
this much time on you.

23:14.701 --> 23:18.134
I mean, you're a baby.
what are you, are you some
kind of coward or what?

23:18.200 --> 23:19.900
Uhh!

23:19.967 --> 23:22.034
It's about bloody time.

23:22.100 --> 23:26.200
I've been waiting for this.
i mean, my god,

23:26.267 --> 23:28.234
You've still got a bit
of fight left in you, i see.

23:28.301 --> 23:31.234
So, you're gonna stand up
for yourself now, are you?

23:31.301 --> 23:33.167
What the hell do you
think i've been doing?

23:33.200 --> 23:36.034
Huh? i've been looking
for a better way out of this

23:36.100 --> 23:38.100
And there isn't one.

23:38.167 --> 23:39.933
There is. yeah, there is.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.434
Let me have a crack at it.

23:42.501 --> 23:44.768
And why should i trust you?

23:44.867 --> 23:46.534
Now...

23:46.567 --> 23:49.967
It's a funny thing,
about trust.

23:50.034 --> 23:52.134
'cause it's a matter
of faith.

23:52.200 --> 23:57.034
I mean, you can never really
be sure of anything. right?

24:01.100 --> 24:04.701
Because i killed scotty.

24:04.768 --> 24:07.000
Shot him dead.

24:08.434 --> 24:10.467
You told me there were
no cameras in here.

24:10.534 --> 24:12.367
This tape belongs to the fbi,

24:12.434 --> 24:15.301
I mean, as evidence
in an ongoing
investigation, right?

24:17.334 --> 24:18.567
All right, so,
you watch the screen.

24:18.634 --> 24:19.734
Watch the screen.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.234
It's gone.

24:30.334 --> 24:32.800
I mean...

24:32.867 --> 24:34.701
It's gone.

24:34.768 --> 24:38.434
If anybody finds
that you ever did that,
you're going to prison.

24:38.501 --> 24:40.200
Yeah.

24:40.267 --> 24:43.200
So now we're in
the same boat,
aren't we?

24:44.267 --> 24:48.267
So let's start
getting creative.

24:49.434 --> 24:52.634
[music playing]

24:58.967 --> 25:00.668
This better be about the case.

25:00.733 --> 25:02.867
Oh, yeah,
fortuitously it is.

25:02.900 --> 25:04.067
This is
mark mclaughlin's
mistress.

25:04.134 --> 25:06.900
She is a dancer
of the...
exotic variety.

25:07.267 --> 25:09.434
We're going to bring
her and his wife in.

25:09.501 --> 25:11.033
An hour before mark died,

25:11.100 --> 25:13.567
He called each of them
on the cell phone
he wasn't supposed to have.

25:13.634 --> 25:15.901
We figured he dropped
his location to them
and got set up.

25:15.968 --> 25:17.534
So, what, you're gonna
establish a baseline

25:17.601 --> 25:19.200
By watching her strangle
a pole with her thighs, are you?

25:19.267 --> 25:20.534
Well, we're trying
to determine

25:20.601 --> 25:22.634
If she gets embarrassed
when she performs.

25:22.701 --> 25:24.501
We could use that
to rattle her.

25:24.534 --> 25:26.000
If you want
to rattle her,

25:26.067 --> 25:27.834
Interview the mistress
and the wife together,
let the sparks fly.

25:27.901 --> 25:29.267
We scheduled them
to avoid that.

25:29.334 --> 25:31.367
Well, that's very
considerate, but wrong.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.334
People find it hard
to suppress their emotions

25:33.367 --> 25:34.934
Wheny're confronted by
the victim of eir deception.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
Ok. we'll bring them in
together.

25:38.067 --> 25:39.367
Good.

25:40.801 --> 25:43.333
Well, i'm glad to see
you pushed ahead on this.

25:44.133 --> 25:46.501
I half-expected to return
and find you sitting
on your thumbs.

25:47.934 --> 25:50.400
Mm-hmm.

25:58.301 --> 26:01.568
Damn, lightman.
you're not messing
around, huh?

26:05.000 --> 26:07.733
Your handler's in the cube
and denning's in the lab.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.000
All right.

26:10.067 --> 26:11.100
Ready?

26:11.167 --> 26:13.634
I guess i got
no other choice.

26:13.700 --> 26:15.867
Let's go have some fun.

26:26.184 --> 26:28.250
What are they doing here?

26:28.317 --> 26:29.384
I'm charging
agent reynolds

26:29.451 --> 26:30.850
For every crime
he committed

26:30.917 --> 26:32.351
While he was
on the greene case.

26:32.417 --> 26:35.317
I was under orders
to commit certain crimes
to maintain my cover.

26:35.384 --> 26:37.617
Based on the assumption
you'd fully cooperate
with prosecution.

26:37.684 --> 26:39.617
You're not keeping
your end of the deal.

26:39.684 --> 26:41.751
I don't think your people
have been telling
the whole truth here.

26:41.818 --> 26:43.417
You know, unless you can
make him testify,

26:43.484 --> 26:45.684
I have no reason
to listen to you anymore.

26:51.983 --> 26:53.983
What is special agent
radotti doing here?

26:54.050 --> 26:57.217
Well, you know how
you were wondering why
reynolds won't testify.

26:57.284 --> 26:58.217
Yeah.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.551
She's about to tell you.

27:11.084 --> 27:12.984
I'm sorry about the wait,
agent radotti.

27:13.051 --> 27:14.418
Special agent radotti.

27:14.483 --> 27:15.617
Where's ben?

27:15.684 --> 27:17.318
Well, he's gonna be tied up
for a while

27:17.384 --> 27:18.418
With the u.s. attorney.

27:18.450 --> 27:22.418
This is some setup
you've got here.

27:22.483 --> 27:24.184
I came to speak with
agent reynolds,

27:24.251 --> 27:27.117
So if he's not available,
i have a lot of work to do
ba at headquarters.

27:27.184 --> 27:29.684
What else can you tell me
about reynolds' drug use

27:29.750 --> 27:32.184
While he was undercover?

27:32.251 --> 27:34.684
He did his duty.

27:34.750 --> 27:37.151
Which, at times,

27:37.217 --> 27:38.583
Included drug use,

27:38.650 --> 27:40.184
So that he could
prove himself

27:40.251 --> 27:42.117
To some very
dangerous people.

27:42.184 --> 27:44.784
You seem to think
he went above  and beyond
the call of duty.

27:44.850 --> 27:46.817
Ben's a good agent

27:46.884 --> 27:50.450
Who got caught up
in a very bad situation.

27:50.517 --> 27:52.517
End of story.

27:54.984 --> 27:58.617
Can you tell me about
the night reynolds killed
scotty villarosa?

27:59.884 --> 28:01.817
Here we go.
radotti:
what are you talking about?

28:01.884 --> 28:03.184
You killed a man
while undercover?

28:03.251 --> 28:05.151
Are you telling me you don't
know anything about it?

28:05.217 --> 28:08.917
There's nothing to know.

28:08.984 --> 28:10.917
He never killed anyo.

28:10.984 --> 28:11.984
What the hell are
they talking about?

28:12.051 --> 28:13.418
That was not
in the file.

28:13.483 --> 28:15.650
Mouth shut, eyes open,
counselor.

28:15.717 --> 28:17.017
Reynolds said
he shot scotty

28:17.084 --> 28:18.217
And then informed you,

28:18.284 --> 28:21.017
As required by fbi protocol.

28:21.084 --> 28:23.017
Never.

28:23.084 --> 28:25.217
You can tell
she's lying, right?

28:25.284 --> 28:29.583
Look, she spent more time
undercover than you.
i can't tell a thing yet.

28:29.650 --> 28:32.084
Ben got in too deep.

28:32.151 --> 28:33.717
He became addicted.

28:33.784 --> 28:36.017
I should have
pulled him out sooner.

28:36.084 --> 28:38.251
Reynolds, you're up.

28:38.318 --> 28:40.151
Wait.

28:40.217 --> 28:43.184
What are you doing?

28:43.251 --> 28:45.650
I'm saving your case.

28:52.617 --> 28:54.384
Where did he get that gun?

28:54.450 --> 28:56.583
From me.

29:00.884 --> 29:03.151
You better start telling
the truth right now.

29:03.217 --> 29:06.184
Ben, don't make this worse.

29:06.251 --> 29:07.517
Let me go.

29:07.583 --> 29:08.984
No. you're not going anywhere

29:09.051 --> 29:11.850
Till you admit
that i told you about scotty.

29:11.917 --> 29:16.284
Whatever you've done,
i can explain the pressure
that you were under.

29:16.351 --> 29:17.450
When the dust settles,

29:17.517 --> 29:20.084
You can have a great career
out of the fbi.

29:20.151 --> 29:21.917
I'm not making
another deal with you.

29:21.984 --> 29:24.017
After killing scotty,
i called you.

29:24.084 --> 29:26.684
I told you everything.

29:26.750 --> 29:27.984
Radotti:
that never happened.

29:27.985 --> 29:30.985
Maybe the drugs made you think
that tha happened.

29:30.985 --> 29:32.283
Look, stop, ok? Stop lying.

29:33.650 --> 29:35.418
You wrote up an incident report
for the shooting

29:35.483 --> 29:36.984
And you had me sign it.

29:37.051 --> 29:38.251
No, i didn't.

29:38.318 --> 29:42.117
Ben, you never called.

29:42.184 --> 29:44.017
I didn't know.

29:44.351 --> 29:45.917
You told me
to stay undercover

29:45.984 --> 29:47.384
Because the case
against greene

29:47.451 --> 29:48.817
Was too important to lose.

29:49.383 --> 29:51.684
If you had come to me
with this,

29:51.751 --> 29:53.550
I could have done my job.

29:53.617 --> 29:56.383
And then you wouldn't be in
the mess that you're in now.

29:56.450 --> 29:59.350
I'm sorry.

30:01.151 --> 30:03.517
I trusted you.

30:05.584 --> 30:08.984
You were all i had.

30:11.717 --> 30:13.584
Oh, she's good.

30:16.184 --> 30:18.218
[buzzer]

30:25.084 --> 30:26.584
But reynolds got to her.

30:26.650 --> 30:28.550
There are 3 points
where the deception leaked.

30:28.617 --> 30:31.817
Yeah, she could have sold the lie
to anyone else except him.

30:32.917 --> 30:35.184
Well, what did you get?

30:35.250 --> 30:36.784
Take agent reynolds
into custody,

30:36.817 --> 30:37.817
Remove that weapon.

30:37.884 --> 30:39.417
No, wait a minute, no.
he's telling the truth.

30:39.484 --> 30:40.417
We can show you.

30:40.484 --> 30:41.784
Take a look at radotti

30:41.851 --> 30:43.283
As she's offering
her first denial.

30:43.350 --> 30:45.417
Save it. he just
confessed to murder.

30:45.484 --> 30:47.851
He had to make an appalling
decision, granted.

30:47.917 --> 30:50.218
But radotti endorsed it.

30:50.283 --> 30:51.751
Her lies were aparent
when he confronted her

30:51.817 --> 30:53.283
From the beginning,
agent reynolds

30:53.350 --> 30:55.218
Has shown a complete
lack of candor.

30:55.283 --> 30:56.383
I don't have any choice.

30:56.450 --> 30:58.517
If you arrest him,
your case is over.

30:58.584 --> 31:01.617
My case was over the second
mark mclaughlin died.

31:01.684 --> 31:03.784
Reynolds is no good to me
without hard evidence

31:03.851 --> 31:05.717
That proves radotti
covered up the shooting.

31:05.784 --> 31:07.817
I don't even know
if that proof exists.

31:07.884 --> 31:09.218
It does.

31:09.250 --> 31:11.417
We just have to follow.

31:11.484 --> 31:14.817
She'll take us there.

31:16.751 --> 31:17.984
we're very sorry for your loss.

31:18.051 --> 31:20.817
We only have
a few questions.

31:20.884 --> 31:23.450
Mark had an unauthorized
cell phone,

31:23.517 --> 31:25.584
And the only people that he called
with it were you two.

31:25.651 --> 31:28.283
So, which one of you
is really grieving,

31:28.350 --> 31:31.684
And which one of you gave him up
to elliot greene's people?

31:34.017 --> 31:34.884
Interesting.

31:34.951 --> 31:36.684
You're both angry.

31:36.751 --> 31:38.218
Yeah, i'm angry.

31:38.283 --> 31:40.051
She got Mark killed.

31:40.118 --> 31:41.817
Maybe you killed him
because he loved me

31:41.884 --> 31:43.684
And not your used
piece of ass.

31:43.751 --> 31:45.584
Shutt your mouth, tramp.

31:45.650 --> 31:49.118
Ok. how long did you know
mark had a mistress?

31:49.184 --> 31:51.851
Long enough to come up
with plan to kill him over it?

31:51.917 --> 31:54.684
I didn't have him killed.

31:54.751 --> 31:57.283
Mrs. mclaughlin,
look at kimi.

31:57.350 --> 31:59.884
How do you feel
when you see her?

32:04.051 --> 32:05.283
Angry.

32:05.350 --> 32:07.584
And sad.

32:07.650 --> 32:10.017
You feel very hurt.

32:13.851 --> 32:16.350
I still loved mark.

32:16.417 --> 32:18.484
It's true, but...

32:18.550 --> 32:20.484
You're hiding something.

32:22.151 --> 32:23.751
I was gonna divorce him, ok?

32:23.817 --> 32:27.184
I talked to a lawyer
last tuesday, 2 weeks ago.

32:27.250 --> 32:28.617
Because of her?

32:30.884 --> 32:34.884
I really believed
he worked on wall street.

32:34.951 --> 32:38.283
I didn't know
he was a criminal
until he was arrested.

32:38.350 --> 32:41.417
I couldn't stay married
to someone like that.

32:41.484 --> 32:44.383
Did you tell him
the truth?

32:46.283 --> 32:49.650
She isn't the kind of person who would
knowingly stay with a criminal.

32:49.717 --> 32:51.984
What kind of person
are you, kimi?

32:52.251 --> 32:54.650
I loved mark.

32:54.717 --> 32:58.483
I was gonna spend my life
with him.

32:58.550 --> 33:00.750
I didn't want him dead.

33:00.817 --> 33:02.917
She's telling
the truth, too.

33:02.984 --> 33:05.084
Well, maybe you let it slip
somehow.

33:05.151 --> 33:08.151
Maybe you wrote it down
on a piece of paper
and forgot?

33:08.217 --> 33:10.717
When i gave mark his phone,
he told me to tell no one.

33:10.784 --> 33:11.684
You gave mark the phone?

33:12.250 --> 33:14.950
Yeah. back when
he was in county,

33:15.017 --> 33:16.684
Before he cut his deal.

33:18.017 --> 33:20.417
You dumb little bitch.

33:20.484 --> 33:22.150
What?

33:22.217 --> 33:24.484
If someone knew that number,
they could locate the phone.

33:24.551 --> 33:26.117
They would know
where mark was.

33:26.184 --> 33:27.484
No one knew the number.

33:27.551 --> 33:29.150
It was our private phone

33:29.217 --> 33:32.350
So she couldn't find out
about us.

33:32.417 --> 33:34.517
Kimi.

33:35.717 --> 33:41.250
Sometimes he would take
work calls on the phone.

33:43.083 --> 33:44.784
From greene.

33:48.717 --> 33:53.083
Mark died and it was my fault.

33:53.150 --> 33:54.950
[sobbing]

34:02.717 --> 34:04.951
You wrote up an incident report
for the shooting,

34:05.017 --> 34:06.650
Which you had me sign.

34:06.717 --> 34:08.016
No, i didn't.

34:08.083 --> 34:10.382
She's nodding yes
while she's saying no.

34:10.550 --> 34:12.117
Well, that's not gonna help
reynolds.

34:12.184 --> 34:14.951
Oh, hey, uh, did you guys
close the case?

34:15.016 --> 34:18.016
Yeah. fbi is working
to tie mghlahin's
murder to greene.

34:18.083 --> 34:20.083
All right. foster.

34:21.284 --> 34:23.417
Ben, you never called.

34:23.483 --> 34:25.617
I didn't know.

34:25.684 --> 34:27.150
You told me
to stay undercover

34:27.217 --> 34:29.550
Because the case against greene
was too important to lose.

34:29.617 --> 34:32.851
If you had come to me with this,
I would have done my job

34:32.917 --> 34:36.016
And you would not be in
the mess that you're in now.

34:36.083 --> 34:37.750
I'm sorry.

34:37.817 --> 34:39.083
She's lying.

34:39.150 --> 34:41.184
Yeah, she is. when she denies
that she knows anything,

34:41.251 --> 34:43.417
She's lying. when she says
she's sorry, she means it.

34:43.983 --> 34:48.284
She cares about reynolds,
but just not enough
to tell the whole truth.

34:48.351 --> 34:49.850
We need to up the stakes
on her,

34:49.882 --> 34:53.217
Make it more clear
how her actions
are affecting reynolds.

34:54.417 --> 34:56.583
How much pull you got
with the justice department?

34:56.650 --> 34:58.451
It depends.
what are you asking for?

34:58.517 --> 35:00.351
I need to call in a favor.

35:00.417 --> 35:02.150
I'm gonna take
run at her.

35:02.217 --> 35:04.883
She's not gonna simply
crack under pressure.

35:04.950 --> 35:06.584
Under the right kind
of pressure, she will.

35:06.651 --> 35:09.818
[soft piano playing]

35:22.150 --> 35:23.917
Hey. how you doing?

35:23.983 --> 35:25.217
Thank you.

35:25.284 --> 35:26.751
Oh. glad i could help.

35:26.818 --> 35:28.784
You have a certain
look about you.

35:28.850 --> 35:30.017
Oh, really?

35:30.084 --> 35:31.417
What kind of look?

35:31.484 --> 35:35.284
Like a fox trying
to outrun the hounds.

35:37.184 --> 35:40.551
I bet that accent of yours gets
you pretty far, doesn't it?

35:40.617 --> 35:43.117
Well, you work with
what you've got, right?

35:44.184 --> 35:46.950
A beautiful woman--
you know the game.

35:48.017 --> 35:50.617
Well, where i work,
beauty is not an asset.

35:50.684 --> 35:53.651
I'll bet you handle your end
of affairs quite nicely.

35:53.718 --> 35:57.017
My affairs, yes.
Other people's

35:57.084 --> 35:58.517
That's the nightmare.

35:58.584 --> 36:00.517
That's the worst.

36:00.584 --> 36:03.617
They screw up and then
they expect you to fix it.

36:03.684 --> 36:07.017
There's just no sense
of accountability

36:07.084 --> 36:10.651
Or follow-through,
self-reliance.

36:10.718 --> 36:13.351
Or loyalty.

36:15.851 --> 36:17.184
Buy me another?

36:17.251 --> 36:18.917
Sure, love.

36:18.984 --> 36:20.617
Excuse me.

36:20.684 --> 36:22.684
2 this time.

36:22.750 --> 36:24.084
I'm sheila.

36:24.151 --> 36:26.151
I'm terry.

36:26.218 --> 36:27.684
Nice to meet you.

36:27.750 --> 36:28.984
Cheers.

36:29.051 --> 36:30.151
Cheers.

36:30.218 --> 36:31.151
[glasses clink]

36:31.218 --> 36:33.684
To the end of a long day.

36:33.750 --> 36:35.951
Thank you.

36:36.017 --> 36:38.151
It sounds like a line.

36:38.218 --> 36:41.383
Well, it is a line. Well...

36:41.450 --> 36:44.117
I think we've met
somewhere before.

36:45.884 --> 36:47.184
Tell me you don't
work with the bureau.

36:47.251 --> 36:48.984
No. wall street.

36:50.551 --> 36:53.851
I think you know my boss.

36:53.918 --> 36:56.317
He's going to trial
in a few days.

36:58.683 --> 37:00.717
Get your hands off me.

37:06.184 --> 37:08.083
It's a shame.

37:08.150 --> 37:11.350
Elliot greene got caught
with his hand in the jar.

37:13.651 --> 37:16.083
It's lucky for him
he's got friends like us.

37:16.450 --> 37:18.550
Hey?

37:19.917 --> 37:21.218
You have a nice night.

37:32.484 --> 37:34.984
Radotti: hey! stop.

37:35.051 --> 37:38.383
Oh! and here i was thinking
i'd ruined my chances.

37:38.450 --> 37:41.650
What did you mean by,
"greene's lucky to have
friends like us"?

37:41.717 --> 37:43.350
Are you saying you're
not a friend of ours?

37:43.417 --> 37:45.250
What are you asking me?

37:45.317 --> 37:49.218
Well, any friend of ours
won't take the stand
against greene.

37:49.283 --> 37:53.118
I can arrest you
for threatening to harm
a federal agent.

37:53.184 --> 37:55.484
Which makes me glad
i did no such thing.

37:55.550 --> 37:56.684
Don't touch him.

37:56.717 --> 37:58.051
I would never.

37:58.118 --> 38:01.184
I saw him today.
he's not even gonna testify.

38:01.250 --> 38:04.151
See, we heard different.

38:04.218 --> 38:06.051
He cut a deal
about an hour ago.

38:06.118 --> 38:09.484
So..night, love.

38:10.550 --> 38:13.951
I'm not gonna let anything bad
happen to reynolds,

38:14.017 --> 38:15.317
So call it off.

38:17.450 --> 38:18.917
The wheels are
in motion, love.

38:18.951 --> 38:21.784
How does 20 years
in federal prison
sound to you?

38:21.851 --> 38:24.151
Based on your experience
with greene, do you think
you can get me to trial?

38:24.218 --> 38:26.283
Oh, i'm not afraid to
go outside the system
to get justice.

38:26.350 --> 38:27.450
That's interesting.

38:27.517 --> 38:30.250
It sounds like you should
be working with us.

38:31.184 --> 38:33.350
You don't need
to kill reynolds.

38:33.417 --> 38:36.718
I have information
that can ensure greene
becomes a free man

38:36.783 --> 38:39.950
Just promise me
nothing happens to ben.

38:40.017 --> 38:41.783
You're playing for time,
love.

38:41.850 --> 38:45.251
You can have greene's
lawyer verify it
in a matter of minutes.

38:46.917 --> 38:48.050
All right.

38:48.117 --> 38:50.284
Let reynolds testify.

38:50.351 --> 38:53.251
Question him about the murder
of scotty villarosa.

38:53.317 --> 38:54.950
Knock it off.

38:55.017 --> 38:57.218
Everybody knows
he killed scotty.

38:57.283 --> 38:58.684
We told him where
to bury the corpse.

38:58.751 --> 38:59.984
But i never reported it.

39:00.051 --> 39:01.817
There's no record of it
in the fbi files.

39:01.884 --> 39:05.250
Have greene's lawyer
ask reynolds the shooting.

39:05.317 --> 39:07.283
He'll be discredited
on the stand.

39:07.350 --> 39:10.051
He'll look like a rogue
agent and the whole case
will collapse.

39:10.118 --> 39:12.851
You don't need to kill him.

39:15.283 --> 39:17.917
Have greene's lawyer ask reynolds
about the shooting.

39:17.984 --> 39:19.951
He'll be discredited
on the stand.

39:20.017 --> 39:22.383
He'll look like a rogue
agent and the whole case
will collapse.

39:22.450 --> 39:24.684
You don't need to kill him.

39:26.350 --> 39:29.250
Anything else you want to add?

39:29.317 --> 39:33.484
Among the many other
atrocities this monster
committed,

39:33.551 --> 39:35.850
Elliot greene held
12-year-old girl hostage

39:35.917 --> 39:39.550
So her ceo father would
disclose his quarterly
earnings a day early.

39:39.617 --> 39:42.784
I'm sorry. what's your point?

39:42.851 --> 39:44.350
I made a choice.

39:44.417 --> 39:46.817
Oh, i see.
and where did that choice

39:46.884 --> 39:49.051
Leave a loyal agent, then?

39:49.118 --> 39:50.851
If i had reported
the shooting,

39:50.917 --> 39:54.283
They would have pulled him
off the case and greene
would still be out there.

39:54.851 --> 39:56.317
I realized last night,
that i couldn't do anything

39:56.383 --> 39:59.517
That would cost you
your life, ben.

40:01.584 --> 40:03.851
I'm so sorry.

40:03.917 --> 40:07.350
It's a little late
for that, isn't it?

40:07.917 --> 40:09.984
I should remind you,
you have the right
to remain silent.

40:10.351 --> 40:12.251
I was in charge
and i put the case

40:12.317 --> 40:13.550
Before the interests
of one person.

40:13.717 --> 40:16.417
Hanging me out to dry
wasn't about the case.

40:16.484 --> 40:17.984
It was about advancing
your career.

40:18.051 --> 40:20.283
Which has obviously
come to an end.

40:20.350 --> 40:22.317
If i didn't do what i did,
you'd have no case.

40:22.383 --> 40:24.917
You should be thanking me.

40:29.517 --> 40:32.450
There will be an internal
investigation,
but you'll be cleared.

40:32.517 --> 40:35.017
You'll testify
against greene
with our full support.

40:35.084 --> 40:36.117
Thank you, sir.

40:36.184 --> 40:37.384
Dr. lightman.

40:37.451 --> 40:38.817
You're welcome.

40:39.684 --> 40:41.551
I could see the, um...

40:41.618 --> 40:43.517
The gratitude.

40:45.118 --> 40:46.507
I'll see myself out.

40:51.084 --> 40:52.117
[lightman whistles]

40:52.284 --> 40:53.984
Oi! convict.

40:54.051 --> 40:56.717
how'd you get here?

40:56.784 --> 40:58.984
I got quite a reputation
with the guards.

40:59.051 --> 41:00.251
They're terrified of me.

41:00.317 --> 41:01.951
[laughs]

41:02.517 --> 41:05.451
Yeah, as they should be.

41:05.517 --> 41:07.551
You all right?

41:07.617 --> 41:08.784
Yeah, you know,

41:08.851 --> 41:10.417
3 hot meals, comfy bed,

41:10.484 --> 41:12.950
Nothing to do but read
and watch tv.

41:13.017 --> 41:14.684
You know, being
a protected witness

41:14.751 --> 41:16.217
Is kind of like
being on vacation.

41:16.284 --> 41:20.184
But i am ready to get
back to work, though.

41:20.250 --> 41:24.417
Yeah, well,
not long now, eh?

41:24.484 --> 41:26.083
Yeah.

41:28.050 --> 41:32.384
Now, officially,
you didn't do anything wrong.

41:32.451 --> 41:34.150
How you feel about it,

41:34.217 --> 41:36.651
That's an entirely
different matter.

41:39.350 --> 41:42.083
You know, i keep thinking
about scotty's son.

41:42.150 --> 41:44.117
His name's mike.
He's...

41:44.184 --> 41:48.083
He's about 12 years old now,
and, uh...

41:48.150 --> 41:51.117
I used to take him
to the knicks games
sometimes and...

41:51.184 --> 41:53.551
He was a good kid.

41:55.117 --> 41:56.517
I killed his father.

41:56.550 --> 41:58.117
Yeah, you did.

41:59.951 --> 42:01.351
Yeah, you did.

42:01.418 --> 42:03.017
You made your choice.

42:03.084 --> 42:04.418
Yeah.

42:08.117 --> 42:10.083
Why didn't you
just write me off?

42:10.150 --> 42:14.350
I've been cut loose
many times, you know,

42:14.417 --> 42:16.584
When the truth
was inconvenient.

42:16.651 --> 42:19.884
There was one person
caught me on the way down.

42:19.950 --> 42:22.184
That's a true friend.

42:22.250 --> 42:23.417
Yeah.

42:23.484 --> 42:24.884
Yeah, she is.

42:27.017 --> 42:30.217
Hey, look, uh,
you know, they pulled
me away so fast,

42:30.284 --> 42:31.584
I never got a chance
to tnank you--

42:31.651 --> 42:32.818
Oh, shut up.

42:38.151 --> 42:42.317
Family doesn't need to
stand on ceremony, all right?

42:42.383 --> 42:44.283
Court's in session.

42:44.350 --> 42:45.984
It's time, agent reynolds.

42:46.050 --> 42:47.050
All right.

42:47.117 --> 42:49.150
Here goes.

42:49.217 --> 42:51.451
You'll get it done.

42:51.517 --> 42:53.351
That i will.
