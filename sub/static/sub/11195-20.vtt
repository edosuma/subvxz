WEBVTT

00:05.923 --> 00:07.966
(Stargate alarm)

00:12.095 --> 00:14.640
Chevron six encoded.

00:14.765 --> 00:19.811
- Glad you could make it, Colonel.
- Wouldn't miss it, sir. This is the best bit.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.818
Chevron seven locked.

00:31.573 --> 00:33.784
Proceeding with MALP transit.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here

00:43.085 --> 00:45.462
(male technician) MALP en route.

00:45.546 --> 00:48.090
You look tense.

00:48.173 --> 00:50.843
No, I'd say anxious.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.096
I am neither tense nor anxious.

00:55.013 --> 00:57.307
Perhaps concerned.

00:57.432 --> 00:58.851
Why?

00:58.934 --> 01:02.521
The address of this planet came
from the repository of the Ancients.

01:02.604 --> 01:05.065
Receiving MALP telemetry.

01:11.989 --> 01:16.118
Nothing I can see resembles
anything we know about the Ancients.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.745
Architecture, technology, writing.

01:18.829 --> 01:21.999
Maybe it came to this planet
after the Ancients left it.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.209
Teal'c, do you recognise any of this?

01:24.293 --> 01:28.422
- I do not, General Hammond.
- Nope. Neither do l.

01:31.383 --> 01:33.010
I'm just saying.

01:37.890 --> 01:40.767
- What's it doing?
- Flying, sir.

01:40.851 --> 01:43.812
- MALPs can't fly.
- Apparently they can.

01:46.148 --> 01:50.235
- Shouldn't there be a memo on this?
- I do not believe we are still in control.

01:50.319 --> 01:53.655
Run a systems diagnostic on the MALP.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.623
- It's stopped transmitting.
- Negative, sir.

02:02.706 --> 02:05.709
We have a strong signal.
We should be receiving video.

02:05.918 --> 02:08.461
Uh, Major, you should take a look at this.

02:09.630 --> 02:13.926
Sir, very high frequency oscillations are
being transmitted on a feedback loop.

02:14.009 --> 02:16.386
- They may be trying to communicate.
- "They"?

02:16.512 --> 02:18.472
Well, whoever "they" are.

02:18.722 --> 02:21.016
- Exactly.
- What?

02:21.183 --> 02:25.270
Sir, I recommend we disengage
the Stargate and analyse this data.

02:25.521 --> 02:27.731
Agreed. Terminate the link.

02:29.733 --> 02:32.653
Whoa! We got an EM spike!
The system is overloading.

02:32.736 --> 02:34.154
- Shut down.
- I can't get in.

02:34.238 --> 02:37.824
- Try override!
- Control systems are locked out! Argh!

02:45.207 --> 02:47.417
The computer's
no longer under our control.

02:47.501 --> 02:50.587
- Emergency disconnect, sir?
- Do it!

02:52.756 --> 02:55.592
- Major, are you OK?
- Yes, sir.

04:26.808 --> 04:29.186
Let's get him to the infirmary.

04:31.897 --> 04:34.691
He's got first- and
second-degree burns, sir.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.402
- I'd like to run some more tests.
- Very well.

04:40.322 --> 04:44.952
The Stargate control systems
and their redundancies are inoperative.

04:45.035 --> 04:47.829
The circuitry in these terminals is fused.

04:47.913 --> 04:50.791
- Any idea what that was?
- None, sir.

04:50.874 --> 04:54.378
The secondary systems are running,
but it was one hell of an EM spike.

04:54.503 --> 04:57.172
I'd like to run a diagnostic
on the main computer.

04:57.256 --> 05:00.342
- Yeah. After I treat this hand.
- As soon as l...

05:00.425 --> 05:02.970
- It is a very bad burn, Sam.
- Five minutes.

05:03.095 --> 05:06.181
- Now!
- Do as the doctor says.

05:06.265 --> 05:07.724
Yes, sir.

05:07.808 --> 05:11.395
Thank you, Colonel.
You, Daniel and Teal'c are next.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.564
- What? I'm fine.
- What? We're fine.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.691
I would like to be the judge of that.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.277
Some form of energy
came through the Stargate.

05:18.360 --> 05:23.657
It's only prudent to make sure there's
no physiological effects to you all. ASAP?

05:26.743 --> 05:30.873
- Who put her in charge?
- The US Air Force.

05:31.373 --> 05:35.752
In medical matters, Dr Fraiser
may overrule those of any rank.

05:40.382 --> 05:43.093
I'm not gettin' all my memos.

05:49.308 --> 05:53.478
Well, by the looks of the control room,
I'd say you're both very lucky.

05:54.188 --> 05:56.565
I guess it could have been worse.

05:57.149 --> 05:59.860
I'd like to know what it was trying to do.

05:59.943 --> 06:04.114
Unfortunately, our best diagnostic tool
for figuring that out was trashed.

06:04.198 --> 06:07.075
- You're all done here.
- Thanks.

06:12.664 --> 06:17.544
- Reporting as requested.
- Thanks, Teal'c. Just have a seat, please.

06:30.766 --> 06:35.145
Can you freeze it just before it cuts out?
I want a video capture of this hub thing.

06:35.229 --> 06:39.149
I might be able to cross-reference
the architecture.

06:41.276 --> 06:46.073
No, I don't think this place is even
remotely connected to Ancient Earth.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.033
(typing)

06:48.825 --> 06:52.871
(Carter) There. This is the start of
the high-frequency oscillations.

06:52.955 --> 06:57.209
They began seconds after we lost video
and started to multiply exponentially.

06:57.292 --> 07:02.422
Then the oscillations fused our equipment
and made it impossible to measure them.

07:02.548 --> 07:08.220
Now, if I isolate the smaller, more detailed
signal and expand the time line...

07:11.682 --> 07:14.685
There. It's a waveform of some kind.

07:14.810 --> 07:17.521
- Alien signal.
- Piggybacked on the MALP telemetry.

07:17.604 --> 07:21.692
That must be how it came back
through an outgoing wormhole.

07:21.775 --> 07:26.029
I can't analyse it until I get the computers
back up. My hands are tied.

07:26.113 --> 07:29.366
- There are other computers.
- Not that I can access.

07:29.491 --> 07:32.578
General Hammond's
put the SGC under quarantine.

07:48.093 --> 07:51.763
- So information was accessed?
- Apparently.

07:51.889 --> 07:53.307
Why? By what?

07:53.390 --> 07:56.977
We don't know, sir. But it branched out
through very specific areas:

07:57.102 --> 08:00.689
..network and language software,
system and application software.

08:00.772 --> 08:04.610
- Learning to read, learning to talk.
- And knowledge of our systems.

08:04.735 --> 08:07.613
You're saying something
was inside our computers?

08:07.696 --> 08:10.073
We're just guessing at this point, but...

08:10.157 --> 08:14.870
Whatever it was, we interrupted it before
it completed its scan of our computer.

08:14.953 --> 08:18.373
Did you determine any more
from the MALP transmissions?

08:18.457 --> 08:23.837
Nothing on or off world resembles
the architecture. It's entirely alien.

08:23.921 --> 08:27.674
(Carter) We're running a virus scan
and purging the entire mainframe.

08:33.263 --> 08:38.727
Our file allocation tables were corrupted.
There are sectors we'll never recover.

08:38.809 --> 08:42.147
I'm maintaining DEFCON 2
and keeping the mountain locked down...

08:42.272 --> 08:46.527
..until you can tell me with confidence
there'll be no further repercussions.

08:46.610 --> 08:49.279
- Yes, sir.
- (camera whirs)

09:09.132 --> 09:11.677
So it's a probe?

09:11.802 --> 09:15.055
No, it's like a probe.
We actually don't know what to call it.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.224
Before we were able to cut it off,...

09:17.349 --> 09:21.728
..a structured EM wave navigated
over half of our computer system.

09:22.271 --> 09:25.774
- For what reason?
- Well, we sent a probe to their world.

09:25.899 --> 09:30.445
- So we're calling it a probe?
- Sure.

09:30.529 --> 09:34.199
We don't know what would have
happened if we hadn't interrupted it.

09:34.283 --> 09:38.203
- It did an awful lot of damage.
- Perhaps that was the intention.

09:38.287 --> 09:40.581
Maybe it was intended to be passive,...

09:40.664 --> 09:43.375
..but was so advanced
that it fused our systems.

09:43.458 --> 09:46.628
- We really have no way of knowing.
- Now, what is this?

09:46.712 --> 09:51.258
The high-frequency oscillations we
received, time magnified and scaled.

09:51.550 --> 09:54.636
Looks like high-amplitude tracings
of an EEG.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.764
- Like a brain wave?
- Yeah.

10:01.018 --> 10:03.061
Hello?

10:13.322 --> 10:16.325
- It's still here.
- What, the probe?

10:16.450 --> 10:18.911
Well, whatever it is.

10:27.753 --> 10:30.547
It sustained itself
within our secondary systems...

10:30.631 --> 10:34.384
..while we were cleaning up
the main computer.

10:34.510 --> 10:36.720
Do I look fat?

10:36.803 --> 10:39.681
It's like it wants us to know that it's here.

10:47.856 --> 10:50.609
Come here often?

11:02.454 --> 11:04.414
Yeah, all right, that's me.

11:33.485 --> 11:36.989
Beg your pardon, sir. The dialling
sequencer just went down.

11:37.072 --> 11:40.325
- Take it off line, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

11:46.373 --> 11:49.626
- It's learning.
- Learning what?

11:50.002 --> 11:53.589
Uh, about us. Who we are,
what we do here.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.425
Put a stop to it, Major.

11:56.508 --> 12:00.762
- Yes, sir.
- We don't even know its intentions.

12:00.846 --> 12:06.310
Doctor, I can't allow an alien technology
into our computer systems.

12:25.537 --> 12:28.707
(Hammond) Have we
maintained quarantine?

12:28.832 --> 12:31.376
(Carter) Yes, sir. We're still isolated.

12:31.668 --> 12:34.129
I don't want to contaminate
the outside world.

12:34.213 --> 12:37.966
I want whatever this is
stopped right here, right now.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.138
I think it likes me.

12:48.060 --> 12:51.230
From what I can decipher, sir,
it's like a computer program:

12:51.355 --> 12:54.358
..incredibly invasive,
but as complex as a DNA strand.

12:54.483 --> 12:57.194
And it's growing.
It's eating more and more memory.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.947
- Can you remove it?
- This will take a shutdown...

13:00.030 --> 13:02.407
..of all systems
connected to the mainframe,...

13:02.491 --> 13:05.202
..followed by a format of all drives.

13:05.285 --> 13:10.249
Unfortunately, sir, all data not backed up
before this event will be destroyed.

13:10.374 --> 13:14.753
- But it's the only way to be sure.
- Understood. Do it.

13:15.254 --> 13:17.548
We'll be out of commission
for a while, sir.

13:17.673 --> 13:21.969
I've already alerted all offworld teams
to stay put until further notice.

13:22.094 --> 13:23.345
Yes, sir.

13:23.470 --> 13:27.057
- Sergeant?
- Stand by for systems power down.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.602
Powering down.

13:38.610 --> 13:39.444
Hey!

14:12.060 --> 14:15.063
- All scans came back clean, sir.
- Thank you, Sergeant.

14:15.147 --> 14:18.734
We may have only lost data
from the last 24 hours before the event.

14:18.859 --> 14:22.529
We'll know more when I can access
the SGC archives in the Pentagon.

14:22.654 --> 14:26.783
I'd like you and Sergeant Siler to
double-check your results before we do.

14:26.867 --> 14:29.244
Yes, sir.

14:29.328 --> 14:31.371
Major.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.168
You're kidding!

14:46.803 --> 14:48.847
Carter!

14:49.431 --> 14:52.142
- Emergency lighting?
- In the MALP room, yes, sir.

14:52.226 --> 14:54.269
A small power-usage anomaly.

14:54.394 --> 14:57.356
General Hammond
said we should check it out.

14:57.439 --> 15:00.692
- Forget to change a light bulb, Siler?
- That's not my job, sir.

15:00.817 --> 15:03.445
Yes, sir. Light bulb. Very amusing.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.126
- It's warm.
- Fire?

15:18.210 --> 15:21.463
(Siler) Alarms would be
going off by now, Major.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.715
It's been welded, from the inside.

15:24.258 --> 15:28.011
By who? There's been nobody
on this level since the power shutdown.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.472
Get a torch.

16:09.553 --> 16:11.430
(whirring)

16:52.137 --> 16:56.600
- What is it?
- I don't know, sir.

16:58.685 --> 17:03.649
I think we robbed the alien program
of an environment, so it created one.

17:06.902 --> 17:12.574
It appears to be sustaining itself from the
electric power from the emergency lights.

17:12.950 --> 17:16.537
It must have gotten into a MALP,
survived on battery power...

17:16.662 --> 17:21.791
..and built this... memory mainframe
while we were on emergency power.

17:22.626 --> 17:26.547
- "Memory mainframe"?
- I know for a fact we wiped out a ton of it.

17:27.256 --> 17:32.845
This program must be able to reproduce
itself from a fraction of its original size.

17:33.178 --> 17:37.432
And now it's expanding into
whatever available memory it can find.

17:37.516 --> 17:39.393
OK!

17:40.018 --> 17:43.021
General, we're gonna need
some claymores down here.

17:43.146 --> 17:45.274
I'm on my way.

17:45.399 --> 17:47.860
You want to blow it up?

17:48.527 --> 17:50.320
- Yes.
- Why?

17:50.529 --> 17:51.864
Why?!

17:51.947 --> 17:56.910
Sir, we've isolated this area. There is
no chance of reinfection of our computer.

17:57.077 --> 18:00.080
It's obviously fighting to survive.

18:00.622 --> 18:03.458
So do bacteria!

18:11.842 --> 18:13.969
It's trying to communicate.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.929
So do bac...

18:16.054 --> 18:20.184
Sir, I agree with Daniel.
This is a life form - obviously intelligent.

18:20.267 --> 18:25.147
We've been in the same position as this
alien entity I don't know how many times.

18:25.230 --> 18:29.693
On another planet, cut off
from our world, trying to stay alive.

18:31.236 --> 18:33.447
What in God's name...?

18:34.323 --> 18:39.745
Well, General, whatever got into our
computers apparently has built a nest.

18:50.756 --> 18:53.133
- Overnight?
- According to the security log,...

18:53.258 --> 18:57.012
..there hasn't been any human activity
in the MALP room for 36 hours.

18:57.179 --> 19:02.476
For the record, sir, I want to blow it
to hell. These folks want to chat with it.

19:03.519 --> 19:08.482
Are you absolutely certain
it can't reconnect to our computers?

19:08.607 --> 19:10.734
General?

19:11.985 --> 19:17.282
It's surviving on an emergency circuit,
so it's isolated from the rest of the base.

19:17.366 --> 19:20.869
We can kill it just by
severing that connection.

19:21.954 --> 19:25.874
- How do you intend to proceed?
- Well, sir, it's provided an interface.

19:25.999 --> 19:30.879
I'd like to try to make contact with it.
If anything goes wrong, we cut the power.

19:32.422 --> 19:34.550
Very well.

20:16.592 --> 20:20.888
Maybe it's trying to figure out
why we sent a probe to its world.

20:29.938 --> 20:31.982
Major Carter?

20:40.115 --> 20:41.992
Carter!

20:46.038 --> 20:48.582
Start an EKG and EEG.

20:49.625 --> 20:51.418
OK. On my count.

20:51.543 --> 20:53.921
Three, two, one.

21:07.476 --> 21:09.770
We in?

21:11.647 --> 21:13.690
(flatline beep)

21:14.233 --> 21:16.610
Charge the paddles 100.

21:16.735 --> 21:19.029
Take over.

21:33.001 --> 21:35.379
It's normal sinus rhythm.

21:41.844 --> 21:43.887
Sir.

21:45.514 --> 21:48.058
What? What is it?

21:48.183 --> 21:52.187
These readings match those that infected
the computer in the first place.

21:52.271 --> 21:54.565
It's inside her.

22:14.918 --> 22:19.965
These weaker readings are
Major Carter's, these are the entity's.

22:20.048 --> 22:23.135
How can a computer program
be inside a human brain?

22:23.218 --> 22:26.221
Sam said it was looking for memory
within which to expand.

22:26.305 --> 22:29.808
The human brain is capable
of storing terabytes of information.

22:29.933 --> 22:34.021
- How do you intend to remove it?
- I doubt it's even possible, sir.

22:34.104 --> 22:36.732
More and more of her brain's
being stimulated.

22:36.815 --> 22:41.695
It's impossible to tell if her memory's
being suppressed, overwritten or erased.

22:41.778 --> 22:46.742
General Hammond. I advise that Major
Carter be placed under armed guard.

22:46.825 --> 22:48.702
What?

22:48.785 --> 22:51.538
If an alien entity
has somehow invaded her body,...

22:51.622 --> 22:55.667
..then she is a security risk,
and must be treated as such.

22:55.751 --> 22:57.377
I agree with Teal'c.

22:57.503 --> 23:02.049
The entity has fooled us twice.
I'll be damned if I'll let it do it again.

23:02.132 --> 23:05.135
She's to remain under guard at all times.

23:05.219 --> 23:07.596
Yes, sir.

23:30.160 --> 23:32.204
Carter?

23:36.291 --> 23:38.585
She's conscious.

23:49.096 --> 23:52.099
Can you talk?

23:54.518 --> 23:58.105
Colonel, her PET scan
resembles that of a stroke victim.

24:00.899 --> 24:06.196
Parts of her brain seem very active.
Others seem dormant or suppressed.

24:06.280 --> 24:08.240
The entity has full motor control.

24:08.323 --> 24:13.287
However, it might be able to communicate
with a speech synthesiser if I explain it.

24:13.412 --> 24:16.832
Just concentrate on
getting it out of her, will ya?

24:17.624 --> 24:19.668
I don't know how, sir.

24:22.838 --> 24:26.508
What about the Tok'ra or Asgard?
Don't they owe us a favour by now?

24:26.633 --> 24:30.888
Till this situation is resolved, Colonel,
we're still under quarantine.

24:30.971 --> 24:34.224
That means from ourallies as well.

24:34.349 --> 24:37.769
We cannot risk the entity
leaving this facility.

24:48.864 --> 24:50.991
It used a capacitor from the MALP...

24:51.116 --> 24:54.203
..to deliver a charge
right through the keyboard, sir.

24:54.286 --> 24:56.497
- Well, don't touch it.
- Yes, sir.

24:56.580 --> 25:02.503
- Sam said it was growing. Expanding.
- Perhaps the entity that possessed her...

25:02.586 --> 25:06.423
..sensed that Major Carter's mind
was a better memory-storage vessel.

25:06.548 --> 25:10.302
- It was a trap.
- A trap?

25:10.427 --> 25:13.764
Yep. It was watching us the whole time.

25:15.766 --> 25:19.895
Uh, so you're saying it knew Sam and I
wanted to make contact with it?

25:20.812 --> 25:22.064
Yeah.

25:22.189 --> 25:26.652
The device was created as a delivery
system, in order to invade her body.

25:26.985 --> 25:30.072
- Yes.
- Basically, what you're saying is that...

25:30.197 --> 25:34.660
..if we'd just listened to you
in the first place and blown it up...

25:34.743 --> 25:37.454
No, seriously. Is that what you're saying?

25:37.538 --> 25:39.915
If we had destroyed the entity,...

25:40.040 --> 25:44.211
..Major Carter would not
have been adversely affected.

25:44.294 --> 25:46.088
OK, look.

25:46.171 --> 25:51.385
I know your first instinct is to protect,
both of you - that's your job - but...

25:51.885 --> 25:56.139
..no matter what happens,
no matter how this turns out,...

25:57.474 --> 26:01.144
..Sam wasn't wrong
to try to communicate with it.

26:36.138 --> 26:38.348
(synthesised voice) O'Neill.

26:38.473 --> 26:40.517
That's right.

26:41.351 --> 26:43.729
Go get the doc.

26:46.231 --> 26:48.525
And you are...?

26:51.153 --> 26:52.946
I am within.

26:56.742 --> 27:01.455
- You are O'Neill.
- Yeah. We've established that.

27:02.831 --> 27:05.209
This one has memory ofyou.

27:05.292 --> 27:08.003
The "one" you're
talking about is a person.

27:08.086 --> 27:11.340
Her name is Major Samantha Carter.

27:13.050 --> 27:15.344
Then... I am Major...

27:15.469 --> 27:17.930
No. No, you're not.

27:21.934 --> 27:26.897
We understand that you've taken control
of Major Carter, but you're not her.

27:28.690 --> 27:30.817
There was no other choice.

27:31.777 --> 27:33.904
No otherplace to go.

27:34.780 --> 27:37.533
You wished to terminate.

27:37.616 --> 27:39.493
Still do.

27:41.578 --> 27:44.915
But you will not. Not now.

27:46.166 --> 27:48.544
I have observed.

27:50.295 --> 27:52.506
You value the life ofone.

27:53.924 --> 27:56.593
Yes, we do.

27:57.761 --> 28:00.222
This one is important.

28:01.932 --> 28:04.226
She is.

28:06.812 --> 28:10.148
For this reason, this one was chosen.

28:11.233 --> 28:15.362
You will not terminate this one
in order to destroy me.

28:18.574 --> 28:21.660
It went into Sam out of self-preservation.

28:23.537 --> 28:27.916
I cannot be removed from
this mind without terminating.

28:28.792 --> 28:31.461
You will not terminate this one.

28:35.841 --> 28:38.510
None ofyou will.

28:42.973 --> 28:45.434
Therefore I will survive.

28:54.359 --> 28:57.362
The entity insists Sam's mind is intact,...

28:57.487 --> 29:00.824
..but I can't detect anything
beyond the barest trace.

29:00.949 --> 29:04.369
I believe, even if I was
somehow able to remove it,...

29:04.495 --> 29:07.414
..she would be essentially braindead.

29:08.207 --> 29:10.167
I see.

29:10.709 --> 29:15.422
Then why does the entity insist
that Sam's mind is still within?

29:15.506 --> 29:17.799
It's the only way to keep us from killing it.

29:17.883 --> 29:20.802
Or it's telling the truth
and we just can't detect it.

29:20.886 --> 29:24.473
Even if Sam is still in there
somewhere, it won't be for long.

29:24.556 --> 29:30.020
The entity's influence is still growing,
and there is nothing I can do to stop it.

29:30.103 --> 29:32.064
What course of action remains?

29:32.189 --> 29:35.943
Well, it wants to survive,
so... we offer to send it home.

29:36.318 --> 29:39.988
This alien technology is capable
of travelling back to us...

29:40.072 --> 29:42.616
..through an outgoing wormhole.

29:42.741 --> 29:46.078
I won't risk the same thing
happening again.

29:46.161 --> 29:51.041
I've already ordered that the coordinates
be locked out of the dialling computer.

29:51.166 --> 29:57.005
Let me talk to it. Maybe we can...
convince it to leave willingly.

29:58.382 --> 30:00.926
Very well, Dr Jackson.

30:01.009 --> 30:02.970
Dismissed.

30:07.808 --> 30:09.142
Jack.

30:09.476 --> 30:11.103
Sir?

30:11.812 --> 30:15.649
We may have to make
some difficult choices.

30:15.732 --> 30:19.403
I know that Major Carter
means a great deal to you.

30:20.070 --> 30:23.240
She's a very valuable
member of my team, sir.

30:23.782 --> 30:25.742
Yes, she is.

30:59.568 --> 31:02.029
My name is Daniel.

31:03.447 --> 31:05.908
(synthesised voice) I am aware.

31:06.033 --> 31:09.453
Right. You, uh... you read my file.

31:10.954 --> 31:15.083
- Yes.
- Then you know I am a scientist.

31:17.044 --> 31:19.087
Yes.

31:21.507 --> 31:24.843
You have determined
I cannot be extracted.

31:26.094 --> 31:28.138
Yes.

31:31.183 --> 31:36.146
I will now offerinformation
in exchange for continued survival.

31:37.981 --> 31:41.151
We don't want your information.
We want Sam.

31:43.904 --> 31:47.574
Leaving this mind
would cause termination.

31:47.658 --> 31:52.120
You left that thing you constructed
in the MALP room. Go back.

31:56.959 --> 32:00.796
I have already grown beyond its capacity.

32:05.259 --> 32:09.805
Why... why did you do this? Why did
you come here in the first place?

32:10.681 --> 32:14.852
- You attacked.
- No, we sent a probe.

32:16.019 --> 32:18.063
Yes?

32:18.730 --> 32:24.653
It's, uh... something we do to determine
whether or not a place is safe for humans.

32:30.325 --> 32:33.662
Radio energy was emitted
from yourprobe.

32:34.872 --> 32:36.999
Contagion.

32:37.082 --> 32:42.129
- Much damage was caused within.
- Within what?

32:44.840 --> 32:46.884
Within us.

32:48.760 --> 32:52.347
It spread before we
understood it was poison.

32:52.556 --> 32:57.352
You're saying your world was damaged
by radio waves from one probe?

32:58.604 --> 33:00.189
Yes.

33:00.272 --> 33:04.651
We didn't mean to hurt you.
It was a misunderstanding.

33:04.776 --> 33:07.070
Yet it is done.

33:07.196 --> 33:10.032
So you came here to... to what?

33:12.284 --> 33:15.037
- Preserve.
- Preserve your world?

33:16.121 --> 33:18.665
- Yes.
- How?

33:20.792 --> 33:22.753
By destroying you.

33:29.343 --> 33:32.137
Well, that's not gonna happen.

33:34.973 --> 33:38.227
Transmission was interrupted.

33:38.727 --> 33:42.147
Ifl had been able
to complete transmission,...

33:42.272 --> 33:45.025
..you would have been destroyed.

33:45.567 --> 33:47.861
My world would have been preserved.

33:47.986 --> 33:50.280
Well, in a way, you succeeded.

33:50.989 --> 33:53.450
We won't go back there.

33:53.742 --> 33:57.329
You can repair the damage and we
won't send any more probes through.

33:57.621 --> 34:00.249
Yes, we will.

34:00.999 --> 34:02.793
Jack?

34:02.876 --> 34:05.796
We'll send dozens of 'em.

34:05.879 --> 34:08.340
One after another.

34:08.465 --> 34:11.009
I don't care what it does.

34:12.719 --> 34:15.472
- No.
- Leave her. Now.

34:16.264 --> 34:18.475
You won't.

34:18.600 --> 34:21.311
You've read my file. Think again.

34:22.103 --> 34:25.357
- I must preserve.
- Fine. Stick to your guns, then.

34:25.440 --> 34:29.110
- Jack...
- Daniel, we're gonna do this my way.

34:29.777 --> 34:31.405
You can't.

34:31.530 --> 34:34.783
- General?
- You're damn right we can.

34:35.367 --> 34:37.578
No. Please.

34:37.786 --> 34:40.330
Leave her.

34:40.414 --> 34:44.626
- I must preserve.
- If you want to preserve your world,...

34:44.710 --> 34:47.004
..leave Major Carter right now.

35:00.184 --> 35:02.227
Stand down!

35:05.522 --> 35:07.816
Let her go!

35:16.492 --> 35:18.952
We have an emergency situation:
corridor 649.

35:44.019 --> 35:47.940
I believe the alien is attempting
to return to the mainframe.

36:15.467 --> 36:16.635
(whoosh)

37:09.605 --> 37:11.982
Still no change.

37:22.659 --> 37:27.789
I don't know if she ever told you this,
Colonel, but Sam made a living will:

37:27.873 --> 37:29.917
.."No extraordinary means."

37:32.878 --> 37:35.422
Yeah, she told me.

37:37.257 --> 37:40.344
There's, uh... there's no
brain activity of any kind.

37:40.469 --> 37:44.139
No brain wave for
either Sam or the entity.

37:44.223 --> 37:47.809
She's being kept alive
entirely on life support.

37:49.645 --> 37:52.648
I think it's time to let her go, sir.

37:58.195 --> 38:01.156
Just, uh... give it a minute, huh?

38:27.516 --> 38:32.479
Hammond ordered the mainframe thing
in the MALP room destroyed,...

38:32.855 --> 38:36.108
..in case the entity managed
to find its way back in there.

38:36.233 --> 38:38.610
That's probably
what it was trying to do.

38:54.835 --> 38:57.045
Sir, we're go for a systems restart.

38:57.171 --> 38:59.882
- Proceed, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

39:17.649 --> 39:20.319
All operational systems are back on line.

39:24.823 --> 39:26.867
Get back!

39:28.911 --> 39:30.787
(alarm)

39:30.871 --> 39:32.915
It's the MALP room, sir.

39:33.040 --> 39:35.834
SG-1 to the MALP room immediately.

39:49.723 --> 39:52.100
I think our friend is back, sir.

39:55.229 --> 39:56.939
All right, let's blow it.

39:59.775 --> 40:01.568
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

40:04.780 --> 40:07.157
Look at this.

40:07.574 --> 40:10.828
- The entity.
- No, it said it couldn't go back.

40:12.913 --> 40:17.459
- It's Sam.
- Daniel... I shot her twice.

40:17.584 --> 40:21.588
After it transferred Sam's
consciousness out of her body.

40:21.672 --> 40:26.051
You killed the entity after it
put Sam into this... this thing.

40:28.136 --> 40:30.597
- She's in here.
- Why?

40:30.722 --> 40:32.933
- Why would it do that?
- You demanded it.

40:33.058 --> 40:36.144
You threatened to send an army
of probes to its home world.

40:36.228 --> 40:38.438
Saving Sam and allowing
itself to be killed...

40:38.564 --> 40:42.234
..was the only way
to preserve its home world.

40:44.069 --> 40:45.863
Get me Hammond.

40:45.988 --> 40:47.406
(phone rings)

40:47.489 --> 40:50.492
- Hammond.
- General, we've got a situation here.

40:50.576 --> 40:53.245
Same here, Colonel. I'm on my way.

41:16.560 --> 41:20.731
This EEG matches Sam's.
I don't know how, but it's her.

41:21.690 --> 41:24.234
- What do we do?
- There's nothing I can do, sir,...

41:24.359 --> 41:27.946
..but to provide a conduit for her
to return into her own body.

41:33.410 --> 41:36.830
The entity has deceived us
on several occasions.

41:42.002 --> 41:44.213
Go ahead, Doctor.

41:44.296 --> 41:46.340
Yes, sir.

42:16.078 --> 42:18.288
She's back.

42:25.504 --> 42:28.340
Hey, Carter. Where you been?

42:31.260 --> 42:34.513
- It's gone?
- Yes, it is.

42:37.182 --> 42:40.853
I was shouting... for you to hear.

42:41.812 --> 42:44.022
We heard.
