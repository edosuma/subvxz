snowfall of the season

01:30.193 --> 01:31.953

and there's an endless list
of projects to do around here.

01:51.525 --> 01:53.354
One of the things
I've always worried about is

01:53.389 --> 01:56.564
there's really been a lot of ice
coming off the roof.

When it comes to the icicles,
that's a real safety hazard.

02:09.715 --> 02:10.923
Those things can weigh a lot

02:10.958 --> 02:12.546
and they don't have
to fall from very far

02:12.580 --> 02:15.618

the cabin melts the snow.

02:26.456 --> 02:29.804
They are a persistent winter
hazard in the Arctic,

02:29.839 --> 02:32.704
but working on a slick roof
15 feet off the ground

02:32.738 --> 02:34.913
is even more dangerous.

Morgan: Now I just gotta get
down off of here.

02:38.123 --> 02:39.642

Morgan plans to build an awning
over the front door.

02:46.856 --> 02:49.652

across this old abandoned cabin.

It's right up along
this creek here.

of old aluminum printing plates.

03:11.846 --> 03:13.779
They're lightweight.
They're weatherproof.

03:13.814 --> 03:15.505
They're the size of
a sheet of newspaper,

03:15.540 --> 03:16.989

like shingles.

to build this awning.

04:03.553 --> 04:05.383
They've got a lot of teeth,

which makes them really nice
for pulling weight

of daylight ahead of him,

04:38.519 --> 04:40.935
the first snow of winter
is on the ground

to deter Jason Hawk

04:48.598 --> 04:51.429
on a new piece of land

there's no road access.

to travel by water.

the only way to get in.

is some water running through it

and a place that we can build
a house and a shop for Jason.

06:52.584 --> 06:55.449
Jason: This isn't
a home-building site.

06:55.484 --> 06:58.245
It's gotta be something
that we can utilize,

take two hours each way

are real small,

for him to focus on it.

11:04.077 --> 11:05.147
Hatchet's a lot younger.

One dog on a lion.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.647
The storm's coming in

11:22.682 --> 11:24.235

I'm just gonna have
to start following him.

11:35.315 --> 11:37.938
It's a big concern when
you got one dog on one lion.

11:37.973 --> 11:41.217
The lion can just smoke
your dog in a heartbeat,

to pinpoint a howl and harder
for Hatchet to pick up a scent.

It's a female.

12:59.571 --> 13:01.988
Narrator: Rich often forces cats
to jump

13:02.022 --> 13:05.129
so the dogs can run them
deeper into the high country.

13:05.163 --> 13:07.890
But with Hatchet's uncertain
performance today,

13:07.925 --> 13:09.823
he calls off the hunt here,

13:09.858 --> 13:13.896
about 5 miles
from the nearest ranch.

a ongoing battle,

13:36.574 --> 13:39.542

13:49.725 --> 13:53.211
Narrator: Across the country
in North Carolina,

13:53.246 --> 13:54.557
months after a tornado

13:54.592 --> 13:57.975
leveled thousands of dollars
of Eustace's cash crop,

13:58.009 --> 14:01.357
the devastation continues.

14:01.392 --> 14:05.154
A massive worm infestation
is devouring the fallen timber

14:05.189 --> 14:07.156
and its value.

14:07.191 --> 14:09.193
Now Eustace and Preston
are mounting

14:09.227 --> 14:10.815
a full-scale recovery operation

14:10.850 --> 14:14.129
to save their profits
before it's too late.

14:14.163 --> 14:17.201
We've got a time clock
ticking right now, you know?

14:17.235 --> 14:19.686
We've got beetles
getting into our wood.

14:19.720 --> 14:23.897
Those things are degrading
the lumber significantly.

14:23.932 --> 14:27.867
Eustace: Well, you just have to
harvest as much as you can

14:27.901 --> 14:30.870
and try to salvage it
and get something out of it

14:30.904 --> 14:34.080
before the worms
eat 'em up completely.

14:34.114 --> 14:36.254
Narrator: But before they can
start hauling logs back

14:36.289 --> 14:37.773
to their sawmill,

14:37.807 --> 14:40.534
they have to widen and repair
the only access road

14:44.228 --> 14:47.196
Man, that's tight.

14:47.231 --> 14:49.405
Yeah, it is.

14:49.440 --> 14:51.614
Is there anywhere
we could go around at all?

14:51.649 --> 14:53.409
Could we
just bypass this?

14:53.444 --> 14:56.136
This is the only way
to get through here.

14:56.171 --> 14:57.517
It's bad, isn't it?

14:57.551 --> 15:00.175
The quickest way to salvage
the timber

15:00.209 --> 15:01.590
is by freight wagon,

15:01.624 --> 15:04.351
which can haul up
to 10 logs at a time.

15:04.386 --> 15:08.045
Fully loaded, it will weigh
nearly 4,000 pounds

15:08.079 --> 15:09.770
and require ample clearance

15:09.805 --> 15:12.152
from the road's
unstable shoulder.

15:12.187 --> 15:15.052
Man, I would hate to drop
a wheel off in there.

15:15.086 --> 15:18.089
That'd be solid rock
we'd be landing on.

15:18.124 --> 15:19.573
Eustace: The wheel will just
fall into the creek.

15:19.608 --> 15:22.369
The wagon will roll.
You'll flip.

15:22.404 --> 15:25.096
You know,
with a heavy load of logs...

15:27.996 --> 15:30.308
It's 7...7 feet
to the drop-off,

15:30.343 --> 15:31.792
but I don't want to be
on the drop-off.

15:31.827 --> 15:34.588
I'd rather have the wheel
at least back here.

15:34.623 --> 15:39.835
And so given 4 inches
over here, that's 5 foot.

15:39.869 --> 15:42.389
And imagine it heavily
loaded with logs coming down

15:42.424 --> 15:43.735
through this slick thing.

15:43.770 --> 15:46.669
Yes, this is just
a catastrophe waiting to happen.

15:46.704 --> 15:48.637
You'll be
in the creek there.

15:48.671 --> 15:50.880
We could try
building that up,

15:50.915 --> 15:53.055

soft and mushy.

15:53.090 --> 15:54.815

is that, Eustace?

-Yeah?
-Yep.

16:09.037 --> 16:10.797

to just drill

16:10.831 --> 16:12.005
a whole bunch of holes,

16:12.040 --> 16:13.627
we fill those things up
with black powder,

then see if we can't get
that rascal to break off.

16:17.079 --> 16:18.460

of powder to blast a way
to a new logging road.

16:51.596 --> 16:53.978
And their time-tested recipe

16:54.013 --> 16:57.706
begins with a simple
ingredient, charcoal.

16:57.740 --> 16:59.984
Going old school
with that rock, huh?

17:00.019 --> 17:01.434

We just take the charcoal
and we grind it up,

17:04.851 --> 17:07.026
sort of smash it up
into smaller pieces

17:07.060 --> 17:08.717
just like a powder.

17:08.751 --> 17:10.960
How much powder do you reckon
we're gonna need

17:10.995 --> 17:12.652
to make to blow
that big rock up?

17:12.686 --> 17:14.826
I'm thinking, like,
a couple buckets.

Let me get
the right mixture.

Eustace: Mix it with water,
make a paste,

17:26.148 --> 17:28.254
and let it dry in the sun.

a little black magic

17:30.532 --> 17:32.465
just like mama
used to make.

All right.

17:33.431 --> 17:35.088
Now, when this stuff
dries out

17:35.123 --> 17:37.470
we'll be better
to rock 'n' roll.

17:45.581 --> 17:47.790
densest rock
that we have around here,

17:47.825 --> 17:49.827
and so we need
a whole lot of black powder.

so we gotta be kind of careful.

22:33.421 --> 22:35.664
and really hidden
at the same time.

22:35.699 --> 22:37.839
You get into these little trees,

22:37.873 --> 22:40.738
you can go 100 yards
and not see where you came from.

22:40.773 --> 22:42.844
It hides all sorts of stuff.

22:47.711 --> 22:50.403
There's some cut branches
on that tree over there,

22:50.438 --> 22:52.992
so that's usually a sign
that someone's been around

22:53.026 --> 22:55.477
collecting firewood
in years past.

22:55.512 --> 22:58.756
Usually there's a lot of those
around any cabin site.

22:58.791 --> 23:01.207
It's gotta be around
here somewhere.

23:03.623 --> 23:08.214
There's a cut stump off
to our left there.

23:08.248 --> 23:12.632
I think I kind of see
a clearing ahead.

There it is.

23:22.055 --> 23:23.471
Finally.

23:23.505 --> 23:26.646
It's hard to see
it's so tumbled down.

23:26.681 --> 23:29.684
It's amazing and sobering
to see how quickly nature

23:29.718 --> 23:31.686
will start to take back
these structures.

23:31.720 --> 23:34.274
I always wonder when I see these
old places like what happened

23:34.309 --> 23:35.897
and what the story is.

23:35.931 --> 23:38.796
I'm sure somebody had high hopes
for this place at one point,

23:38.831 --> 23:41.868
but it's a pile
of rotten wood now.

23:41.903 --> 23:45.562
It's a good reminder that
that could happen to us, too.

Narrator: Morgan's here
on a mission to scavenge

23:47.736 --> 23:49.911
whatever he can from the ruins,

23:49.945 --> 23:53.915
primarily a pile of aluminum
that's a rarity in the bush

23:53.949 --> 23:56.711
and ideal for construction
and roofing.

23:56.745 --> 23:58.160
Morgan: The day's short.

23:58.195 --> 24:01.301
I'm gonna dig out the printing
plates and get out of here.

24:01.336 --> 24:04.650
I think it was right
in here somewhere.

24:04.684 --> 24:07.307
It kind of makes me nervous
walking around in the snow

24:07.342 --> 24:10.587
on this rotten floor
I know is underneath me.

24:10.621 --> 24:14.453
Alls I'd have to do is step
on a rusty nail

24:14.487 --> 24:18.215
and it'd be a pretty
ugly walk home.

24:18.249 --> 24:20.493
I gotta get this out
of the way, though.

right there.

I bet they put this cabin
together in '84, '85.

25:09.887 --> 25:12.027
All right, let's see what else
is around here.

25:12.062 --> 25:14.823
Stuff like this is really
precious out here

25:14.858 --> 25:16.549
and well worth its weight.

25:16.584 --> 25:18.033
You know, as long
as I'm over here,

25:18.068 --> 25:19.552
I'm gonna poke around
in the snow

25:19.587 --> 25:21.520
and see what else there is.

25:21.554 --> 25:23.349
Oh, that's a nice
big timber spike.

25:23.383 --> 25:24.523
There might be
some more of them.

25:24.557 --> 25:27.560
I mean those things
cost $1.50 apiece.

25:27.595 --> 25:31.426
They're really useful
for all sorts of log building.

25:31.460 --> 25:33.601
Definitely

25:33.635 --> 25:35.637
I spent a lot of time
getting here, a lot of effort,

25:35.672 --> 25:40.021
so I don't wanna leave
anything too useful.

25:40.055 --> 25:41.954
They have barrels
right along here.

25:41.988 --> 25:43.783
I think it was right
in here somewhere.

25:43.818 --> 25:46.545
This is kind of like
Alaskan recycling.

25:46.579 --> 25:49.720
The stuff would probably
be junk anywhere else,

25:49.755 --> 25:51.239
but because we're so far out

25:51.273 --> 25:55.036
and it costs so much
to get anything out here,

25:55.070 --> 25:57.694
we kind of have to utilize
all the resources

25:57.728 --> 26:00.489
that are available to us.

26:00.524 --> 26:02.975
Nice, that's a barrel.

Narrator: The heavier Morgan
makes his load,

26:07.013 --> 26:10.603
the slower and more difficult
the trip home will be.

26:10.638 --> 26:14.227
But the 40-pound barrel
is too valuable to pass up.

26:14.262 --> 26:16.989
Morgan: A barrel like that,
it's just got 1,001 uses.

26:17.023 --> 26:19.612
You can make those things
into wood stoves.

26:19.647 --> 26:23.754
You can make them
into water tanks, water boilers.

[ Grunts ]

26:29.139 --> 26:31.486

26:31.520 --> 26:33.799
Well, I think I got
what I came for.

26:33.833 --> 26:35.145
I could probably spend
all day here,

26:35.179 --> 26:37.734
but the way the day's getting,

26:37.768 --> 26:39.667
I got a ways to go back
dragging that barrel.

26:39.701 --> 26:42.324
It's not gonna be
a real quick trip.

26:42.359 --> 26:44.982

took two full hours.

26:45.017 --> 26:47.226
With a 60-pound load in tow,

26:47.260 --> 26:49.193
the return trip will be a race

26:49.228 --> 26:53.819
against oncoming darkness
and plunging temperatures.

26:53.853 --> 26:55.786
I'm gonna have a heavy load
going back

26:55.821 --> 26:58.340

26:58.375 --> 26:59.963
I definitely don't want
to stay out tonight,

26:59.997 --> 27:03.138
so I gotta get the hell
out of here.

In the Blue Ridge Mountains,

27:16.807 --> 27:19.672
Eustace and Preston head
for the blast zone

27:19.707 --> 27:21.778
armed with their homemade
black powder.

27:21.812 --> 27:23.814
We got this black powder made

27:23.849 --> 27:26.679
and hopefully we'll see
if we can't pop that rock.

27:26.714 --> 27:28.854
Narrator: Their goal is
to widen the logging road

27:28.888 --> 27:30.683
so they can gain easy access

27:30.718 --> 27:33.824
to 12 acres
of storm-damaged timber.

27:33.859 --> 27:35.032
Preston: We need to be able
to get in there,

27:35.067 --> 27:36.309
load up that wagon,

27:36.344 --> 27:39.140
start cutting some timber,
and then get moving.

27:39.174 --> 27:42.005
Narrator: But first they have to
sheer off at least 2 feet

27:42.039 --> 27:45.629
of a granite slab
that's encroaching on the trail.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.596
Eustace: Yeah, there are
a couple seams right there.

27:47.631 --> 27:49.840
-Yup.
-That one's close enough.

27:49.875 --> 27:53.741
If we can get that clump off,
we might could make it by.

27:53.775 --> 27:54.811
Nice.

way up there.

Exploiting a weakness.

27:57.468 --> 27:59.712
Eustace: The best way
to blow up this rock

27:59.747 --> 28:01.749
is to drill holes down
in the cracks

28:01.783 --> 28:04.061
and pack them full
with black powder.

28:04.096 --> 28:06.167
What are you thinking,
somewhere in there?

28:06.201 --> 28:08.065
Yeah, let's try it.

28:08.100 --> 28:10.550
Narrator: The most efficient way
to blast the rock

28:10.585 --> 28:14.106
is to place the explosives
below its surface.

28:14.140 --> 28:17.281
A homemade drill rigged
with a masonry bit

28:17.316 --> 28:20.077
bores a hole
at least 6 inches deep.

28:20.112 --> 28:22.286
It's a challenge drilling
through this rock.

28:22.321 --> 28:24.703
It's not like we got
an air hammer or anything.

28:26.670 --> 28:29.224
But the deeper we can make
the hole and the more powder

28:29.259 --> 28:30.950
we can get in there, the better.

28:30.985 --> 28:34.367
"Let the weight of the hammer
do the work,"

28:34.402 --> 28:35.748
Papaw would say.

28:40.201 --> 28:42.168
Well, we're
getting down there.

28:42.203 --> 28:45.862
We'll just try
a little piece

28:45.896 --> 28:49.900
and try it
and see what happens.

28:49.935 --> 28:52.420
It might do nothing
or it might blow a chunk

28:52.454 --> 28:54.663
or it might blow
the whole thing.

28:57.874 --> 28:59.738

trial and error.

I don't know.

I don't know what it's gonna do,
but we'll find out.

29:05.260 --> 29:08.056
If we just lit that, it would
just shoot like a gun

29:08.091 --> 29:09.471
out of a rock barrel.

29:09.506 --> 29:10.783
It would just
fly out of there.

29:10.818 --> 29:13.061
So we need to pack it
full of clay

29:13.096 --> 29:16.893
so that powder will stay down
inside the rock.

-Here goes nothing.

Well,
we still need more.

more powder, man.

that's for sale and on budget.

34:32.760 --> 34:34.141
That would be it
right up here.

34:34.175 --> 34:37.247
Let's see what
it's like further on up.

34:37.282 --> 34:39.456
Narrator:
To get a full lay of the land,

34:39.491 --> 34:43.184
Jason must locate the markers
that outline the property.

34:44.289 --> 34:48.431
Jason:
If I am at the right spot,

34:48.465 --> 34:52.297
there should be some
property markers pretty close.

34:52.331 --> 34:55.334
There's one, I think.

34:59.787 --> 35:04.205
Yup, probably a corner marker.

35:04.240 --> 35:07.967
It's about right here, corner.

35:08.002 --> 35:14.353
So, walk down and see what
the other corner looks like.

35:14.388 --> 35:16.114
Right now, it's looking good.

35:16.148 --> 35:17.598
I've got water access.

35:17.632 --> 35:19.841
That covers the water
end of things.

35:19.876 --> 35:22.637
It also gives me
an area to plant.

35:22.672 --> 35:25.261
Usually you get back away
from the rocks

35:25.295 --> 35:27.159
you get some good loam
built up there.

35:27.194 --> 35:29.713
That's always a good sign.

35:32.716 --> 35:34.546
The only part of this
I'm not liking,

35:34.580 --> 35:38.481
it looks like we're dropping
back down towards the river.

35:38.515 --> 35:40.690
Narrator: Building a homestead
beside a creek

35:40.724 --> 35:41.863
has its advantages,

35:41.898 --> 35:45.039
but it also carries
the risk of flooding.

35:45.073 --> 35:47.490
Jason needs to ensure
that the entire property

35:47.524 --> 35:50.769
sits above
the creek's floodplain.

35:50.803 --> 35:53.081
This makes me
a little nervous.

35:53.116 --> 35:56.671
What I'm seeing is
a big ol' slough

35:56.706 --> 35:58.949
running through this property.

35:58.984 --> 36:03.022
It's where the backwaters
of the river run.

36:03.057 --> 36:07.130
Cuts down the usable
land incredibly.

36:07.165 --> 36:13.136
You know, I'm gonna check out
one more corner and see.

36:13.171 --> 36:18.624
If it ain't uphill, then I've
made this hike for a bust.

36:28.703 --> 36:30.878
Here's the damn stake.

36:34.295 --> 36:36.228
It sucks.

36:36.263 --> 36:39.127
Washed-up trees,
backwater eddies,

36:39.162 --> 36:41.371
and an entire island
that's underwater,

36:41.406 --> 36:44.167
at least for a portion
of the year.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.652
It's not gonna leave
a bunch of land.

36:46.687 --> 36:49.241
Narrator:
Of the 15 acres for sale,

36:49.276 --> 36:52.589
nearly 14 show signs
of seasonal flooding.

36:52.624 --> 36:55.834
Jason needs at least 10 above
the creek's high water mark

36:55.868 --> 36:59.182
for a homestead to be viable.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.977
Jason: I mean, when you're
laying down a homestead,

37:01.011 --> 37:03.531
you have to have
some buildable land.

37:03.566 --> 37:05.913
There's a lot of infrastructure.

37:05.947 --> 37:08.087
I've gotta put up
a blacksmith shop.

37:08.122 --> 37:12.333
We've got a house, eventually
something for livestock.

37:12.368 --> 37:14.232
This isn't gonna fit that bill.

37:14.266 --> 37:17.580
On top of that, you still
gotta cut a road into it.

37:17.614 --> 37:21.066
And it obviously floods.

37:21.100 --> 37:23.033
Not my idea of a good time.

37:23.068 --> 37:27.348
Right now, I got my family
living in a tent.

37:27.383 --> 37:29.316
Winter's nipping at my heels.

37:29.350 --> 37:31.870
I've gotta figure out something.

37:38.704 --> 37:42.570
Narrator:
In the Ozark Mountains,

37:42.605 --> 37:45.987
Jason's come up empty
on his property scout,

37:46.022 --> 37:49.922
but he's not
returning empty handed.

37:49.957 --> 37:52.511
-[ Whistles ]
-Daddy's home.

37:52.546 --> 37:54.479
Hey, baby.

37:54.513 --> 37:56.929
Well, I'm not coming back
with any good news

37:56.964 --> 37:58.759
about the girls' dream
of property,

37:58.793 --> 38:03.315
but on the other hand, they're
gonna have full bellies tonight.

38:03.350 --> 38:06.732
I don't think I've ever seen
a fish that big before.

38:06.767 --> 38:07.733
Welcome to Arkansas.

38:07.768 --> 38:10.218
It's like 20 pounds.

38:10.253 --> 38:13.808
At this point, I'm beat.

38:13.843 --> 38:16.017
You should come
and sit by the fire.

38:16.052 --> 38:17.433
I should.
You been being good?

38:17.467 --> 38:20.470
Yeah.

38:20.505 --> 38:24.198
Mary: So how was the property?
Any place to build?

38:24.232 --> 38:27.339
I mean, there's maybe
one acre, if that,

38:27.374 --> 38:30.998
of buildable land
out of 15.

38:31.032 --> 38:33.034
The rest of it's
floodplain.

38:33.069 --> 38:34.829
It's not gonna work out.

38:34.864 --> 38:38.937
[ Sighs ] So here we are
at the end of the day.

38:38.971 --> 38:42.561
Sure, we got dinner, but we're
gonna have to start over,

38:42.596 --> 38:45.219
look for a different place.

38:45.253 --> 38:47.255
It's getting kind of late
in the year.

38:47.290 --> 38:48.912
I know it's only gonna
get colder.

38:48.947 --> 38:53.089
We really do need
some solid walls.

38:53.123 --> 38:54.366
Want to try a little
bite of the skin?

38:54.401 --> 38:56.920
It's really good.

38:56.955 --> 38:58.336
Delicious.

38:58.370 --> 39:00.338
Jason:
We've had some major setbacks,

39:00.372 --> 39:03.064
couple stumbling blocks
along the way,

39:03.099 --> 39:04.376
but we're still here.

39:04.411 --> 39:07.897
Finding the right place,
it just takes time.

39:19.426 --> 39:21.497
Narrator:
In the Great Alaska Range,

39:21.531 --> 39:23.257
Morgan's scavenger hunt

39:23.291 --> 39:25.535
has taken him
far longer than expected

39:25.570 --> 39:28.262
and well into the cold night.

39:28.296 --> 39:31.299
Temperatures have dropped to
a bone-chilling 35 below

39:31.334 --> 39:32.818
since sundown,

39:32.853 --> 39:34.475
marking his seventh
straight hour

39:34.510 --> 39:36.546
of exposure to the elements.

39:36.581 --> 39:39.618
Battling exhaustion as he pushes
through the dense snowpack,

39:39.653 --> 39:42.276
he's guided only by
a single beam of light.

39:42.310 --> 39:44.865
Morgan:
I gotta watch out now.

39:44.899 --> 39:47.419
There's a lot of hazards
at night.

39:47.454 --> 39:50.974
This is kind of the time
when accidents can happen.

39:51.009 --> 39:53.563
You gotta just try to be
as careful as possible out here

39:53.598 --> 39:55.358
because it's not like
there's a safety net

39:55.393 --> 39:58.361
out here to catch you.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.881
No matter how experienced
somebody is,

40:00.915 --> 40:02.434
they can sure
get their ass handed

40:02.469 --> 40:05.610
to them in a hurry
in temperatures like this.

40:05.644 --> 40:09.268
Definitely been a long day
and I'm ready to get home.

40:15.378 --> 40:18.692
Oh, there's the house.

40:18.726 --> 40:20.038
All right.

40:20.072 --> 40:23.973
That's a light
in the window there.

40:24.007 --> 40:26.320
Hello, hello.

40:26.354 --> 40:28.426
Margaret:
Hello, welcome back.

40:28.460 --> 40:30.186
What did you find?

40:30.220 --> 40:32.119
Oh, I found some treasures.

40:32.153 --> 40:35.743
Oh, that looks heavy.

40:35.778 --> 40:36.882
-Oh, wow.
-Yeah.

40:36.917 --> 40:39.160
You cut a lot of wood.

40:39.195 --> 40:40.886
Awesome, yeah.

40:40.921 --> 40:41.991
Look out.

40:42.025 --> 40:45.132
Yeah, check some
of this stuff out.

40:45.166 --> 40:47.721
-Oh, cool.
-Yes, look at these things.

40:47.755 --> 40:49.964
Margaret: These salvaged items
are so valuable to us

40:49.999 --> 40:52.139
because they're things
we didn't have to fly in.

40:52.173 --> 40:53.899
They're things we didn't have
to pack it on the horses.

40:53.934 --> 40:56.315
They were just left
in the woods.

40:56.350 --> 40:58.007
So, it's really nice
to find these things

40:58.041 --> 40:59.698
that we can utilize.

40:59.733 --> 41:01.044
Morgan:
Check this out, though.

41:01.079 --> 41:04.013
These are from the '80s.

41:04.047 --> 41:05.186
Oh.

41:05.221 --> 41:07.016
I think there's probably
20 of them there.

41:07.050 --> 41:09.397
They're in varying
degrees of...

41:09.432 --> 41:11.883
-Disarray?
-Yeah.

41:11.917 --> 41:13.471
Morgan: A little bit
of something

41:13.505 --> 41:14.920
takes a lot of work to get it.

41:14.955 --> 41:17.923
Out here in the mountains, you
can put in a whole lot of work

41:17.958 --> 41:20.339
and only have a little bit
to show for it,

41:20.374 --> 41:22.134
and that's just the way it is.

41:22.169 --> 41:24.827
There's some tea going inside
if you want some.

41:24.861 --> 41:26.173
Yeah, that's good.
Melt this ice off my beard.

41:26.207 --> 41:27.588
[ Laughs ]

41:27.623 --> 41:30.108
It's been a long day. I think
it's time to eat some dinner

41:30.142 --> 41:32.075
and tomorrow
we'll improve the house.

41:32.110 --> 41:35.734
Morgan: It was a good day
and I'm gonna go warm up.

41:42.810 --> 41:44.916
Narrator:
Next time on "Mountain Men"...

41:44.950 --> 41:46.469
-By God, we got one.
-[ Laughs ]

41:46.504 --> 41:47.850
Tom: We got one.

41:47.884 --> 41:50.024
Narrator: ...Tom's new
partnership pays off.

41:50.059 --> 41:51.785
That's what they call
trapping fever.

41:51.819 --> 41:54.166
Beaver fever.

41:54.201 --> 41:56.306
Eustace gets moving.

41:56.341 --> 41:57.756
[ Thud ]

41:57.791 --> 41:59.240
Oh, did you hear that?

41:59.275 --> 42:01.035
But it's a false start.

42:01.070 --> 42:03.417
Eustace: It feels like we move
a little bit forward,

42:03.451 --> 42:05.868
then take two steps backwards.

42:05.902 --> 42:07.801
Narrator: And Marty is
forced into retreat.

42:07.835 --> 42:09.457
How are you doing,
baby girl?

42:09.492 --> 42:11.805
But finds new hope.

42:11.839 --> 42:16.706
One, two, three,
four...five.

42:16.741 --> 42:18.466
There is a lot
of wolves here.
