[Drea] <i>It was the night</i>
<i>the first bombs were dropped,</i>

00:15.640 --> 00:17.851

-Jo!

00:19.602 --> 00:20.562
Jojo.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.272
Dude, just tell me.

00:22.355 --> 00:24.315
Did you plan this book shit
around our family vacation,

00:24.399 --> 00:26.276
or did we plan our family vacation
around your book shit?

00:26.359 --> 00:28.528
I swear to God,
keep calling it my book shit

00:28.611 --> 00:30.280
and see what you
fucking do to me.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.949
Dude, I don't even know
who you are anymore, dude.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.451
This is so fucked up!

00:34.534 --> 00:37.203
Why and how is this fucked up, Kenya?

00:37.287 --> 00:38.747
-Are you being serious right now?
-Yes!

00:38.830 --> 00:39.831
How is it fucked up?

00:39.914 --> 00:42.375
You, out of anybody in the world,
should understand

00:42.459 --> 00:44.627
how working and vacationing
at the same time

00:44.711 --> 00:46.838
is a good thing, right?
You should understand that.

00:46.921 --> 00:48.298
Oh, my God! [scoffs]

00:48.381 --> 00:49.299
-Oh, okay.
-Okay.

00:49.382 --> 00:51.259
Okay. Okay.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.764
Any time we go away, he's working.

on American story structure.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.688
I never 100 percent confirmed this,

01:03.772 --> 01:05.940
but I'm pretty sure
this one time we went to Maui,

01:06.024 --> 01:10.070
and he taught an all-day master class
on how to work on vacation.

01:11.237 --> 01:12.947
I wasn't working on vacation.

01:13.031 --> 01:16.159
I was working
and we got a vacation out of it.

01:16.242 --> 01:17.202
What was she gonna do?

01:17.285 --> 01:18.953
Sneak out of our room
in the middle of the day

01:19.037 --> 01:20.705
then sneak back
like some kind of psychopath?

01:20.789 --> 01:23.208
Pretend she was getting
like a 90-minute shiatsu?

01:23.291 --> 01:25.418
Some kind of fucked up
paddle board lesson?

01:26.211 --> 01:27.879
All she had to do was say something.

01:28.463 --> 01:29.631
I'm a reasonable guy.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.258
A reasonable guy?

01:32.550 --> 01:33.635
[laughing]

01:33.718 --> 01:35.929
That came out of his mouth?

01:36.012 --> 01:37.639
Wait, you can't be serious.

01:37.722 --> 01:38.807
Did he say that?

01:38.890 --> 01:42.060
Did he actually say that?
Can somebody please get me the tape?

01:42.143 --> 01:45.271
I'm serious, I'll wait.
I want to see it, go get it.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.818
As my parents' fighting raged on,

01:49.901 --> 01:52.237
my sister and I were locked in more of...

01:52.862 --> 01:54.447

All right, guys.
We're gonna do this.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.810
No, you cannot go out there.
There was just a tropical storm.

02:24.269 --> 02:25.687
You're gonna get pulomia.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.523
Wait, wait, wait, you mean pneumonia?

02:28.773 --> 02:29.941
No, pulomia.

02:30.650 --> 02:33.069
Wait, so you know what it is,
but you don't know how to pronounce it?

02:33.153 --> 02:34.404
Well, I looked it up.

02:34.487 --> 02:36.447
I wanted to know
how Jim Henson went out.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.492
Okay, weirdo. Let's go, dude. [chuckles]

02:39.576 --> 02:41.035
Stop, wait! We can't just

02:41.578 --> 02:43.079

02:43.913 --> 02:45.248
God, you're a nerd.

-Why is he like this?
-[gasps incredulously]

02:47.250 --> 02:49.043
I think Mom breastfed him too long.

02:49.627 --> 02:51.296
[scoffs] You guys sound stupid.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.506
You can't be breastfed for too long.

02:53.590 --> 02:54.966
When did he stop?

02:55.049 --> 02:57.260
I guess he would have been, like, five.

02:57.886 --> 02:58.845
[Drea] Five?

02:58.928 --> 03:02.432
You fed my brother milk from your bosom
until he was five years old?

03:03.016 --> 03:04.350
In emerging countries,

03:04.434 --> 03:06.978
it is considered normal
to drink breast milk

03:07.061 --> 03:08.605
well into your teens.

03:08.688 --> 03:12.233
In emerging countries, they also think
albino body parts have special powers.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.776
That is not the same thing.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.987

It's fine, though.

melanoma in my family, though.

From what I understand, it's one
of the worst cancer deaths. Um...

We had to bury my uncle Hecky
in a closed casket.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.463
I mean, he was pussing, like ooze.

05:38.546 --> 05:39.630

with all Muenster cheese?

I'll follow you.

This brunch is about to give me life.

I'm going a couple chia seed puddings,

05:50.391 --> 05:51.434
couple crepes.

You think it's crazy if I ask
for an entire fig?

-Oh, no.
-Princess Drea! What's the business?

05:57.982 --> 05:59.275
What's up, Marquise?

05:59.567 --> 06:00.401
So.

There's a super chill bonfire later
if you want to roll.

-No, babe, I don't think that's her scene.

goes to college for a year

06:30.473 --> 06:32.475

she's got it figured out.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.394
She doesn't know what my scene is.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.813

06:51.619 --> 06:53.204
I might need another scene.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.040
I might be down to kick it later.

06:56.541 --> 06:57.667
Okay, Drea.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.420
I'm serious. I would like to hang out.

07:02.964 --> 07:03.840
Fine.

about us drinking, you're gone.

-[Izzy] Ha. No.

[Pops] Wait, where are you going?

07:41.294 --> 07:44.088
Take it in, boys.
This is what freedom tastes like.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.340
Oh, it tastes so good.

07:47.091 --> 07:48.384
It is delicious.

07:48.676 --> 07:52.054
We should probably stick to the parts
of the resort without people.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.556
We might run into somebody.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.641

07:59.770 --> 08:01.314
After you take these little guys
to their stop,

08:01.397 --> 08:03.983
would you mind driving my husband and I
to the clubhouse?

08:04.066 --> 08:05.234
Actually--

08:05.318 --> 08:07.528
Actually, we were just heading that way.

08:07.612 --> 08:08.696

Mr. and Mrs. Wesbird,

08:23.544 --> 08:25.087

08:30.635 --> 08:31.594
Whoa.

08:32.303 --> 08:34.180
Not too shabby, fellas. [chuckles]

08:34.722 --> 08:37.141
With our cuteness and your motor skills,

08:37.225 --> 08:40.269
I feel like
we could easily make, like, millions.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.979
I feel that you're not wrong.

08:42.063 --> 08:45.066
And I feel that Fijian juvenile hall
is a nightmare,

08:45.149 --> 08:47.568
so I'm guessing maybe
we should get the frick out of here.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.028
I feel like you're a nerd.

08:59.288 --> 09:01.332

No bag, no bag.

not gonna answer his call?

11:34.151 --> 11:37.113
I don't, but that's a risk
I'm willing to take right now.

That's right, girl, and the best revenge

11:53.337 --> 11:54.964

Okay.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.663
So, I did some research

13:50.746 --> 13:53.833

13:55.000 --> 13:56.585
Trust me, you're fine.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.504
You know, the only rule you need to know

13:58.587 --> 14:00.631
is liquor before beer
and you're in the clear.

14:01.423 --> 14:03.008
That's actually not true.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.760
Oh, it's absolutely true.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.096
No, it has less to do
with the order of consumption

14:07.179 --> 14:09.765

-Okay, I don't care.

14:09.849 --> 14:10.975
Okay? Don't ruin this.

30:11.434 --> 30:13.019
Thank you so much. Um...

30:13.561 --> 30:14.479
[clears throat] 

30:14.979 --> 30:16.356
I'm just a little-- Excuse me.

30:18.608 --> 30:20.235
Oh, shit.

30:21.486 --> 30:22.570
Okay. Oh. 

30:25.031 --> 30:26.032
Thank you.

30:26.115 --> 30:28.076
Thank you so much for, um...

30:28.159 --> 30:29.160
for coming today.

30:29.244 --> 30:30.453
Um... [clears throat]

30:31.079 --> 30:32.121
Okay. Oh.

30:34.624 --> 30:36.292
I'm Joya Barris.

30:36.376 --> 30:39.879
I'm the author of the book, obviously.

30:39.963 --> 30:41.548
[laughs]

30:41.631 --> 30:43.132
[sighs and clears throat]

30:45.885 --> 30:49.973
Um, so before we, uh, get...
before I get started,

30:50.348 --> 30:51.182
um...

30:51.724 --> 30:53.893
I just want to say how much this book

30:54.686 --> 30:56.688
means to me and, uh...

31:07.115 --> 31:08.408
[exhaling]

31:08.491 --> 31:10.785
The humble words that Andre Johnson said,

31:11.327 --> 31:12.328
that I wrote...

31:13.663 --> 31:14.789
really got to me.

31:15.790 --> 31:17.542
Made me want to be a better person.

31:18.209 --> 31:19.335
Be a better husband.

31:20.753 --> 31:21.671
<i>Black-ish.</i>

31:22.630 --> 31:23.965
Such a good show.

31:24.215 --> 31:25.884
-Such a good show.
-[Drea] Yeah.

31:26.301 --> 31:27.927
Never got that Emmy, though.

31:28.553 --> 31:29.387
Nope.

31:30.638 --> 31:33.349
Got the Humanitas, Golden Globe,

31:34.267 --> 31:35.977
AFI, Peabody,

31:37.020 --> 31:38.563
bunch of amateur awards,

31:38.980 --> 31:40.148
basically swept.

31:42.567 --> 31:43.443
That Emmy,

31:44.527 --> 31:45.820
elusive statue.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.701
I worked for a long time on it,
and it wouldn't

31:52.118 --> 31:54.287
have been possible without the support

31:54.704 --> 31:56.456
and love of my family,

31:57.332 --> 31:58.499
which, um...

31:59.584 --> 32:02.795
you're about to hear too much about, so...

32:03.296 --> 32:05.214
without further ado, um...

32:06.257 --> 32:07.967
I'll just read you a little bit.

32:08.885 --> 32:11.596
We'll start with my favorite chapter...

32:12.513 --> 32:17.518
entitled "Why Babies and Molly Don't Mix."

32:17.602 --> 32:18.686
[guests laughing]

32:19.145 --> 32:22.398
Thank you so much for coming.
Thank you.

32:22.482 --> 32:23.316
Hi!

32:24.275 --> 32:25.234
Thank you.

32:27.028 --> 32:30.573
Don't forget, you too can be a lawyer,
wife, mother of six.

32:31.074 --> 32:32.617
Oh, I'm actually barren.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.412
But I'm considering going back
to law school now, so...

32:36.496 --> 32:38.081
-Oh! That's the spirit, honey.
-Thank you.

32:40.333 --> 32:42.543
-Who's next? Yeah.
-[Kenya] I'm sorry. Excuse me.

32:42.752 --> 32:45.797
Don't shoot. It's just me.
It's my wife, I'm so sorry. [chuckling]

32:46.089 --> 32:46.965
I'm so sorry.

32:47.423 --> 32:48.800
-Hi.
-Um, hi.

32:49.008 --> 32:51.302
Dude, that was fucking amazing.

32:52.011 --> 32:54.472
I'm so proud of you. Like, seriously.

32:54.555 --> 32:56.599
-Are you fucking with me?
-No, man.

32:56.683 --> 32:58.017
Like, that was amazing.

32:58.101 --> 33:01.020
Like, I'm so glad I came,
I can't believe I almost missed this.

33:01.688 --> 33:04.857
Even though you didn't tell me about it,
and I found out at the last minute...

33:04.941 --> 33:07.068
-Kenya, listen.
-Um... No.

33:07.151 --> 33:09.654
You didn't tell me about it
because I've been being a dick.

33:11.239 --> 33:13.074
Seriously, I'm sorry.

33:13.157 --> 33:15.076
I've been giving you shit
about this and...

33:15.576 --> 33:18.454
seeing you out here doing your thing
and, like, living your life.

33:18.538 --> 33:19.539
It's amazing.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.709
I forget how dope you are
because we're just in our shit every day,

33:22.792 --> 33:23.876
but you're the shit.

33:24.585 --> 33:26.963
-Really?
-Yes, babe. I'm so sorry.

33:27.922 --> 33:29.507
-I love you.
-I love you.

33:29.590 --> 33:32.260
I'm really, really sorry.
Thank you for putting up with me.

33:32.343 --> 33:34.095
-I do put up with you.
-[laughs] I'm a lot.

33:34.178 --> 33:36.431
-You're a lucky man.
-I am the luckiest.

33:36.514 --> 33:37.724
[both laugh] 

33:37.807 --> 33:38.850
Have you, um...

33:39.308 --> 33:40.518
read the book yet?

33:41.436 --> 33:42.437
Oh...

33:42.937 --> 33:45.106
-I want to say yes--
-No. It's okay.

33:45.189 --> 33:46.774
I think, maybe better you don't.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.735
Yeah, just summarize it for me.

33:48.818 --> 33:49.652
Yeah, I will.

33:50.319 --> 33:52.071
-I love you.
-I'm so proud of you. Seriously.

33:52.155 --> 33:53.906
Hurry up. Come home. Bye!

33:54.824 --> 33:56.951
So sorry, guys. Thank you. Amazing book.

33:57.368 --> 33:59.871
Start to finish.
Thrills, chills, everything.

34:00.621 --> 34:02.498
He's actually a really nice guy.

34:02.582 --> 34:03.666
[woman laughing]

34:03.750 --> 34:06.753
So, barely, just barely,

34:06.836 --> 34:10.757
<i>our family had survived</i>
<i>the latest Barris family vacation war.</i>

34:11.174 --> 34:14.969
<i>Each of the troops left affected</i>
<i>in their own unique ways.</i>

34:16.220 --> 34:18.598
<i>Some came out earning new stripes</i>
<i>and respect...</i>

34:19.223 --> 34:22.101
<i>accomplishing near impossible missions...</i>

34:22.185 --> 34:24.729
["The Scientist" by Coldplay playing]<i> </i>

34:24.812 --> 34:26.939
<i>...emerging as battle-tested heroes.</i>

34:28.816 --> 34:29.901
<i>And as for me,</i>

34:30.860 --> 34:33.613
<i>while I was coming out of the trenches</i>
<i>a little wounded,</i>

34:34.113 --> 34:38.076
<i>I had faced the dangers</i>

34:39.202 --> 34:41.496
<i>Ready to put myself out there</i>

34:42.580 --> 34:44.707

34:48.920 --> 34:51.380
When I first started filming
this documentary,

34:51.798 --> 34:53.674
there were a lot of,

34:54.717 --> 34:58.137
let's say, ugly moments
that I was hesitant to show.

34:58.888 --> 35:00.640
<i>Especially the fighting.</i>

35:01.808 --> 35:05.186
<i>But, something that I've come to realize</i>
<i>is that</i>

35:05.603 --> 35:07.105
<i>families need to fight.</i>

35:07.605 --> 35:10.608
<i>Just like countries fight</i>
<i>to build a better world,</i>

35:10.691 --> 35:12.860
<i>families fight to better each other.</i>

35:13.236 --> 35:14.237
<i>It's healthy.</i>

35:16.697 --> 35:18.533
<i>It's like my dad said before:</i>

35:19.534 --> 35:22.787
<i>You only really have to start worrying</i>
<i>when the fighting stops.</i>

35:24.122 --> 35:26.457
<i>And if I know anything about my family,</i>

35:26.958 --> 35:29.669
<i>the fighting isn't stopping anytime soon.</i>

35:36.592 --> 35:38.594
