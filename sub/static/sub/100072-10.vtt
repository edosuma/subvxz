¶<i> It seems today</i>

00:04.413 --> 00:08.083

<i>MAN (on TV): We now return to</i>
LEGO Spotlight.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.455
("Yakety Sax" playing)

00:42.359 --> 00:45.194
I'm not sure we should be
letting Stewie watch this.

00:45.195 --> 00:46.380
It's LEGO. It's fine.

00:46.381 --> 00:48.957
- Yeah, you're right.
- (whistle blows)

00:48.958 --> 00:50.275
Well, that's my train.

00:50.276 --> 00:53.244
Time to disappear
from this life completely.

00:53.245 --> 00:56.056
No, no, Peter. It's just Chris
practicing his new recorder.

00:56.057 --> 00:57.765
What? I said no hobbies.

00:58.968 --> 01:01.586
Brian, that LEGO movie
kind of scared me.

01:01.587 --> 01:04.306
Ah, don't worry about it,
Stewie. It's all make-believe.

01:04.307 --> 01:07.233
- ("Yakety Sax" plays)
- Ah! LEGO! LEGO!

01:08.886 --> 01:10.478
(playing high-pitched note
repeatedly)

01:10.479 --> 01:12.573
Chris, stop!
That sounds terrible.

01:12.574 --> 01:14.932
Yeah, you can't just play
one note over and over.

01:14.933 --> 01:16.577
You're not Danny McBride.

01:16.578 --> 01:18.269
Who taught you
to play like that?

01:18.270 --> 01:19.913
Well, our music teacher quit

01:19.914 --> 01:22.416
and was replaced
by a back-East bird.

01:22.417 --> 01:23.825
(bird whistles two notes)

01:23.826 --> 01:25.276
(students play same notes)

01:25.277 --> 01:26.569
(bird whistles same notes)

01:26.570 --> 01:27.904
(students play same notes)

01:27.905 --> 01:29.423
(school bell rings)

01:29.424 --> 01:30.948
See you tomorrow, Mr. Mason.

01:30.949 --> 01:32.759
(bird whistles same notes)

01:32.760 --> 01:35.337
Well, I'm gonna have to talk to
Principal Shepherd about this.

01:35.338 --> 01:37.839
Great. Every kid
loves seeing their mom

01:37.840 --> 01:39.174
inside their high school.

01:39.175 --> 01:41.268
I'm sorry, but music
is an important part

01:41.269 --> 01:42.603
of your education.

01:42.604 --> 01:43.920
Your mother's right, Chris.

01:43.921 --> 01:45.013
You don't want to mess this up,

01:45.014 --> 01:47.015
like Skee-Lo messed up
his wishes.

01:47.016 --> 01:49.967
Uh, I wish I was a little bit
taller, I wish I was a baller,

01:49.968 --> 01:52.112
I wish I had a rabbit
in a hat with a bat.

01:52.113 --> 01:54.597
(magical chiming)

01:54.598 --> 01:56.950
- Skee-Lo?!
- What?

01:56.951 --> 01:59.410
You need money!

02:02.365 --> 02:03.648
(tranquil music playing)

02:03.649 --> 02:06.776
You wanted to see me,
Mrs. Griffin?

02:06.777 --> 02:09.779
Um, yes,
to discuss the music program.

02:09.780 --> 02:11.706
Right! Right, of course.

02:11.707 --> 02:14.492
Sorry. I was just testing
these... candles

02:14.493 --> 02:17.620
for a... lie I can't...
think of right now. (panting)

02:17.621 --> 02:21.499
Now, what's this forgettable
misunderstanding all about?

02:21.500 --> 02:24.127
Uh, my son is being taught
by a bird.

02:24.128 --> 02:26.813
- Ah. Ms. Wilkins.
- No, Mr. Mason.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.316
Right. Lot of open windows
in this school.

02:29.317 --> 02:31.676
You need a real music teacher.

02:31.677 --> 02:35.155
I'm a trained piano player, and
I've taught lessons for years.

02:35.156 --> 02:37.181
I'd love to come work for you.

02:37.182 --> 02:39.784
You would?
Well, that changes everything.

02:42.146 --> 02:44.164
I'm not gonna have sex with you.

02:44.165 --> 02:46.916
I know. I just farted.

02:50.487 --> 02:54.532
So, everyone,
I have an announcement to make.

02:54.533 --> 02:57.511
I'm gonna be the new
music teacher at Adam West High.

02:57.512 --> 02:59.421
- What?
- Please say you're joking.

02:59.422 --> 03:01.664
I'm not joking. I start Monday.

03:01.665 --> 03:03.925
My wife, a music teacher?

03:03.926 --> 03:06.519
Hold on.
That's a marriage time-out.

03:12.527 --> 03:14.510
I... I think Dad did this wrong.

03:14.511 --> 03:16.863
Yeah, aren't-aren't <i> we</i> supposed
to be the frozen ones?

03:16.864 --> 03:19.223
- Dad's a loser.
- Yeah, he sucks.

03:19.224 --> 03:21.702
- Stop it.
- Why? He can't hear us.

03:21.703 --> 03:23.019
<i>PETER:</i>
<i>But I could hear them.</i>

03:23.020 --> 03:24.520
<i>And it hurt.</i>

03:24.521 --> 03:25.730
<i>Turns out,</i>
<i>if you're gonna learn</i>

03:25.731 --> 03:27.874
<i>how to stop time</i>
<i>in wizard school,</i>

03:27.875 --> 03:30.785
<i>don't leave class early to be</i>
<i>the first in line for lunch.</i>

03:30.786 --> 03:32.546
<i>It was pizza day.</i>

03:32.547 --> 03:34.548
<i>And you'd think it's got</i>
<i>to be pretty good pizza,</i>

03:34.549 --> 03:37.092
<i>being made by a magic wand</i>
<i>and whatnot.</i>

03:37.093 --> 03:38.885
<i>But it was just okay.</i>

03:38.886 --> 03:41.537
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>it was the usual guy making it.</i>

03:41.538 --> 03:45.349
<i>This has been a Peter Griffin</i>
<i>Marriage Time-Out.</i>

03:48.730 --> 03:51.973
(indistinct chatter)

03:51.974 --> 03:53.758
(chatter stops)

03:53.759 --> 03:55.568
Good morning, class.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.989
So... you know.
(chuckles)

04:01.743 --> 04:04.560
I'm your new music teacher,
Mrs. Griffin,

04:04.561 --> 04:07.748
and I started from the bottom.
Now I'm here.

04:07.749 --> 04:09.991
So... rap.

04:09.992 --> 04:11.442
(laughter)

04:11.443 --> 04:13.444
Oh, my God, you're so lame.

04:13.445 --> 04:15.112
I know you are, but what am I?

04:15.113 --> 04:16.447
Lame.

04:16.447 --> 04:18.591
Okay, we'll call that one a tie.

04:18.593 --> 04:21.336
Now, class,
what is music to you?

04:21.337 --> 04:22.620
BOY:
Nothing.

04:22.621 --> 04:24.121
Okay, Deaf Larry, we know

04:24.122 --> 04:26.299
music is nothing to you
and never will be.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.009
Who else? What is music to you?

04:28.010 --> 04:29.293
Stupid.

04:29.294 --> 04:31.420
Connie, you're just afraid,
so you lash out.

04:31.421 --> 04:33.965
I get you, because I <i> was</i> you.

04:33.966 --> 04:36.592
Headstrong, full of anger,
and a body that looked

04:36.593 --> 04:38.779
like it stepped
right out of <i> Redbook</i> magazine.

04:38.780 --> 04:40.614
- GIRL: Is that good?
- Yes, that's good.

04:40.615 --> 04:42.023
You don't know. Shut up.

04:42.024 --> 04:43.975
You were <i> never</i> me.

04:43.976 --> 04:46.410
Oh, no? Look down at your desk.

04:48.272 --> 04:49.480
"L.G."?

04:49.481 --> 04:51.124
Lois... Griffin.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.960
But-but weren't you
Lois Pewterschmidt back then?

04:53.961 --> 04:55.653
Meg, go to
the principal's office.

04:55.654 --> 04:57.205
My desk also has "L.G." on it.

04:57.206 --> 04:59.156
- Mine, too.
- They all do!

04:59.157 --> 05:02.118
Okay, okay, I didn't know where
the troublemaker was gonna sit.

05:02.119 --> 05:05.806
Mr. Mason may have been a bird,
but at least he wasn't a liar.

05:05.807 --> 05:09.183
Well, you better get used to <i> me,</i>
'cause Mr. Mason's gone.

05:11.169 --> 05:13.629
Sweetie, it's the middle
of the day. What happened?

05:13.630 --> 05:15.982
- (whistles two notes)
- Oh, no.

05:15.983 --> 05:19.635
Well, I hope this doesn't affect
our plan to have eggs.

05:19.636 --> 05:20.987
(whistles same notes)

05:20.988 --> 05:23.823
You <i> wanted</i> this to happen!

05:28.571 --> 05:30.980
So, Lois, how was
your first big day teaching?

05:30.981 --> 05:32.407
You pull a Mary Kay Letourneau?

05:32.408 --> 05:33.858
(laughs)

05:33.859 --> 05:35.192
No, Peter.

05:35.193 --> 05:36.652
I didn't leave my family

05:36.653 --> 05:40.507
to have sex with a 12-year-old
boy named Vili Fualaau,

05:40.508 --> 05:44.201
get arrested for rape, give
birth to his child in prison,

05:44.202 --> 05:46.680
get out, get arrested again
for humping him in a car

05:46.681 --> 05:49.516
when he was 13,
have his second kid in jail,

05:49.517 --> 05:51.167
get out, get married to him,

05:51.168 --> 05:54.354
change my name
to Mary Kay Letourneau-Fualaau,

05:54.355 --> 05:56.714
live my life
as a disgraced sex offender,

05:56.715 --> 05:58.549
and then get dumped by him.

05:58.550 --> 06:01.269
(laughing):
No, I didn't do that.

06:01.270 --> 06:03.864
But I did have a little trouble
in Meg's class

06:03.865 --> 06:06.015
because of that brat
Connie D'Amico.

06:06.016 --> 06:08.851
She's a classic,
entitled, mean-girl slut.

06:08.852 --> 06:11.520
Connie D'Amico? She stopped by
to see you yesterday.

06:11.521 --> 06:13.230
She did?! What'd she say?

06:13.231 --> 06:16.042
- She said you're gullible.
- And?

06:16.043 --> 06:17.878
Hmm, Connie D'Amico.

06:17.879 --> 06:19.695
The name sounds familiar.

06:19.696 --> 06:21.405
I better go check
Meg's yearbook--

06:21.406 --> 06:25.242
pages four, six, 11,
27, 41, 42 and 60--

06:25.243 --> 06:27.578
to see if it's the babe
I'm thinking of.

06:27.579 --> 06:29.246
Lois, I'll take
my dessert upstairs

06:29.247 --> 06:31.758
in the masturbation bathroom.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.417
(sighs)
Maybe I'm not cut out

06:33.418 --> 06:35.086
to teach high school kids.

06:35.087 --> 06:37.213
I thought
I could handle their nonsense,

06:37.214 --> 06:39.566
but I just kind of froze today
with Connie.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.717
- Yeah, hang it up.
- You gave it a day.

06:41.718 --> 06:42.961
That's nonsense, Lois.

06:42.962 --> 06:45.054
You just have to be more
of an authority figure.

06:45.055 --> 06:46.406
If Connie gets out of line
again,

06:46.407 --> 06:48.265
don't be afraid
to show her who's boss.

06:48.266 --> 06:50.226
Like I did with those squirrels.

06:50.227 --> 06:52.153
- (squirrels chittering)
- Hey, neighborinos.

06:52.154 --> 06:53.914
Um, so, not a huge deal,

06:53.915 --> 06:56.082
but if you guys could keep
your chittering down,

06:56.083 --> 06:58.442
I'm trying to get
some writing done in the house.

06:58.443 --> 06:59.994
Oh, yeah, yeah,
no-no problem, bro.

06:59.995 --> 07:02.405
Also, maybe you could go (bleep)
your own face, huh?

07:02.406 --> 07:03.614
Could that be good?

07:03.615 --> 07:04.666
- (laughter)
- Yeah!

07:04.667 --> 07:06.117
(chuckles)

07:06.118 --> 07:07.928
(chucking):
Oh. Okay.

07:07.929 --> 07:10.263
All right, thanks, guys.

07:10.264 --> 07:11.956
Stewie? What are you doing here?

07:11.957 --> 07:13.749
I followed you into your cutaway

07:13.750 --> 07:16.127
because I didn't believe
you showed anyone who's boss.

07:16.128 --> 07:17.771
And I was right.

07:17.772 --> 07:20.498
Did you get a sleeve tattoo
of Freddie Mercury?

07:20.499 --> 07:22.024
Yeah, it's a cutaway.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.595
(playing light
chord progressions)

07:26.596 --> 07:29.640
I know some of you kids think
this class has nothing to do

07:29.641 --> 07:32.786
with your day-to-day lives,
but you couldn't be more wrong.

07:32.787 --> 07:35.646
Music tells the story
of our lives.

07:35.647 --> 07:37.648
For example, this morning,

07:37.649 --> 07:40.535
I woke up
and saw it was a sunny day.

07:40.536 --> 07:42.461
(plays Grieg's "Morning Mood")

07:45.466 --> 07:47.542
Then I had some tea.

07:47.543 --> 07:49.636
(plays "East Asian riff")

07:49.637 --> 07:52.288
Which was from China.

07:52.289 --> 07:56.142
On my way out the door, the
kitty cat ran across my piano.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.127
(plays dissonant,
descending notes)

07:58.128 --> 07:59.554
Get off of there, kitty cat!

07:59.555 --> 08:01.172
(laughs)

08:01.173 --> 08:03.007
Then I drove to work.

08:03.008 --> 08:04.775
(plays rapid, upbeat melody)

08:05.820 --> 08:08.154
But then, I hit some traffic...

08:08.155 --> 08:10.824
(plays ominous sting)

08:10.825 --> 08:13.234
...that was caused by a parade.

08:13.235 --> 08:15.903
(plays Sousa's
"The Stars and Stripes Forever")

08:15.904 --> 08:17.521
For gay rights.

08:17.522 --> 08:20.149
(plays "The Stars and Stripes
Forever" in high octave)

08:20.150 --> 08:22.669
And finally,
I got to school early

08:22.670 --> 08:25.696
and diarrhea'd
in the girls' locker room.

08:25.697 --> 08:28.491
(plays sustained low note)

08:28.492 --> 08:30.034
The end.

08:30.035 --> 08:31.160
You suck!

08:31.161 --> 08:32.253
Aah!

08:32.254 --> 08:35.515
(laughter)

08:35.515 --> 08:37.374
That's it, Connie!

08:37.375 --> 08:39.143
To the principal's office. Now!

08:43.432 --> 08:46.768
Okay. For the rest of the class,
I will wait for the bell.

08:46.769 --> 08:48.511
(school bell ringing)

08:48.512 --> 08:50.772
And then I will suddenly talk
much louder and faster

08:50.773 --> 08:52.365
as you're heading out the door.

08:52.366 --> 08:54.868
Okay, and remember, there's
a quiz a week from Wednesday!

08:54.869 --> 08:56.685
- (students gasping)
- BOY: Oh, no.

08:56.686 --> 08:58.538
Good. That means you heard me.

08:58.539 --> 09:01.707
This is how Hollywood thinks
school teachers talk.

09:05.454 --> 09:07.530
Connie, I've asked Mrs. Griffin
to be here

09:07.531 --> 09:09.716
since it was <i> her</i> class
you disrupted.

09:09.717 --> 09:13.077
And I'm sorry to say, this is
your third strike this year.

09:13.078 --> 09:14.870
According to school policy,

09:14.871 --> 09:17.164
three strikes means
you're expelled.

09:17.165 --> 09:18.541
What?!

09:18.542 --> 09:21.085
Principal Shepherd,
I'm not sure that's necessary.

09:21.086 --> 09:23.045
I'm sorry.
I've made my decision.

09:23.046 --> 09:25.256
Now, if you ladies don't mind
stepping out,

09:25.257 --> 09:27.308
I have to reprimand
Danny McBride next.

09:27.309 --> 09:29.593
Mr. McBride,
do you know why you're here?

09:29.594 --> 09:33.556
Yeah, maybe because I'm awesome,
and you're a gay homosexual,

09:33.557 --> 09:35.266
and also the word
"Jet Ski" a lot?

09:35.267 --> 09:36.767
(grunting)

09:36.768 --> 09:39.244
(chuckling):
Yeah, you know why you're here.

09:45.086 --> 09:48.070
Ugh. I feel kind of bad
about getting Connie expelled.

09:48.071 --> 09:49.780
But maybe
this'll make her realize

09:49.781 --> 09:51.833
she needs to be
more respectful to others.

09:51.834 --> 09:53.951
Eh, probably not.
She's really hot.

09:53.952 --> 09:55.119
(phone vibrates)

09:55.120 --> 09:56.787
Hey, Lois, I just got an invite

09:56.788 --> 09:58.506
for a Facebook group
you started called

09:58.507 --> 10:01.101
"Keep Harriet Tubman
Off the 20-Dollar Bill."

10:01.102 --> 10:03.627
What? I haven't even been
on Facebook today.

10:03.628 --> 10:06.347
Wow. Your profile pic is now
just the word "veterans"

10:06.348 --> 10:08.724
with a circle
and a line through it.

10:08.725 --> 10:11.277
I mean, that's the way I feel
about ghosts, but veterans?

10:11.278 --> 10:13.446
Mom, this is Connie
getting back at you.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.139
It's called "cyberbullying."

10:15.140 --> 10:17.975
(scoffs)
Cyberbullying? Me?

10:17.976 --> 10:21.788
By the way, Vili Fualaau
is now a DJ in Seattle.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.939
Boy, Connie must
really mean business.

10:23.940 --> 10:26.650
Like an Armenian kid
in a candy store.

10:26.651 --> 10:28.944
Hey, little boy, can I help you?

10:28.945 --> 10:30.538
Yes, I wish to buy business

10:30.539 --> 10:33.299
and turn into car wash.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.175
(children shouting in distance)

10:36.953 --> 10:38.829
(women chuckle)

10:38.830 --> 10:42.099
We had no idea
you'd switched teams, Lois.

10:46.147 --> 10:47.722
Ugh. Damn it, Connie.

10:47.723 --> 10:50.224
No, it's just a nasty prank.

10:50.225 --> 10:52.059
What's so nasty about it?

10:52.060 --> 10:53.844
(chuckles):
I mean, nothing.

10:53.845 --> 10:55.396
I-I'm fine with it.

10:55.397 --> 10:57.473
Okay, well,
if you're so fine with it,

10:57.474 --> 10:58.974
what are you doing Friday night?

10:58.975 --> 11:01.352
Oh, um...

11:01.353 --> 11:04.497
Mmm. So, I got
my blacksmith certification.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.241
- I can make axes now.
- Oh.

11:07.242 --> 11:09.243
You in the market for an ax?

11:09.244 --> 11:11.362
I'll keep this
on the D.L. Hughley,

11:11.363 --> 11:14.590
but your next date should be
with Christ.

11:17.678 --> 11:20.755
Lois, are you using
the Elmo toothbrush,

11:20.756 --> 11:23.257
- which is mine?
- Oh, sorry, Peter.

11:23.258 --> 11:26.043
I've just been so distracted
with this whole Connie thing.

11:26.044 --> 11:27.544
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

11:27.545 --> 11:30.214
So, Connie made you mistake
a monster's face

11:30.215 --> 11:31.599
for the words "Oral-B."

11:31.600 --> 11:33.050
Come on, Peter, I'm serious.

11:33.051 --> 11:34.551
This is a real problem.

11:34.552 --> 11:35.937
Well, if she's really ruining
your life,

11:35.938 --> 11:37.554
go down to the station
and talk to Joe.

11:37.555 --> 11:39.607
Yeah, I thought of that,
but I hate competing

11:39.608 --> 11:43.018
with the sound of ringing phones
and typewriter keys.

11:43.019 --> 11:44.061
- (phones ringing, keys clacking)
- And she hacked

11:44.062 --> 11:46.230
- all my Internet accounts.
- What?

11:46.231 --> 11:49.191
Connie!
I think she hacked my Twitter!

11:49.192 --> 11:51.193
Well, without any
hard evidence, Lois,

11:51.194 --> 11:53.379
I'm afraid
there's nothing we can do!

11:53.380 --> 11:56.624
Fine! I knew this would be
a waste of time!

11:56.625 --> 11:59.410
Okay, fellas, she's gone!

11:59.411 --> 12:00.945
(ringing and clacking stop)

12:00.946 --> 12:03.389
I'd like to report somebody
using the wrong toothbrush.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.082
Have a seat, sir.
Tell me everything.

12:05.083 --> 12:07.309
Okay. You know Elmo, right?

12:10.898 --> 12:14.141
Hmm, I'm not seeing
any Viva brand paper towels.

12:14.142 --> 12:16.736
- That's the only brand I use.
- Uh, sounds good.

12:16.737 --> 12:19.763
I'm gonna go see what new stuff
they're turning into milk.

12:19.764 --> 12:21.932
Oh, wood milk!

12:21.933 --> 12:25.319
Hey, that woman has
all the Viva brand paper towels.

12:25.320 --> 12:27.655
E-Excuse me, miss,

12:27.656 --> 12:30.958
could I have one of those
Viva brand paper towel rolls?

12:32.610 --> 12:35.571
- (gasps)
- Oh, so sorry.

12:35.572 --> 12:38.332
I need them all
for the big mess you've made.

12:38.333 --> 12:40.668
Hey, Lois, do we need
any jeans milk at home?

12:40.669 --> 12:43.170
Oh, hey, Connie.
Nice shopping outfit.

12:43.171 --> 12:44.455
Come on, Connie.

12:44.456 --> 12:46.081
It's the only brand I use.

12:46.082 --> 12:49.343
I need it to pat down bacon
and let Meg suck the wad.

12:49.344 --> 12:50.794
Too bad, bitch.

12:50.795 --> 12:52.729
(scanner beeps)

12:54.000 --> 13:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:03.308 --> 13:05.309
- (beeps)
- There we go.

13:05.310 --> 13:07.620
I know it's been you
cyberbullying me.

13:07.621 --> 13:09.122
I didn't mean
to get you expelled,

13:09.123 --> 13:10.814
but now I'm glad I did.

13:10.815 --> 13:13.200
You're a very disrespectful
young lady.

13:13.201 --> 13:14.943
At least <i> I'll</i> have a paper towel

13:14.944 --> 13:17.237
with the power
to take on any spill.

13:17.238 --> 13:18.447
Okay, that's it.

13:18.448 --> 13:20.041
You'll pay for this, Connie!

13:20.042 --> 13:23.660
You better watch your step.

13:23.661 --> 13:24.928
(gasping and murmuring)

13:29.501 --> 13:31.627
Ah, darn it. I couldn't open
my camera in time.

13:31.628 --> 13:33.837
Oh, you can just text me yours.

13:33.838 --> 13:36.565
I'm not texting you.
I don't know you.

13:39.636 --> 13:41.804
Peter, I'm exhausted.

13:41.805 --> 13:43.564
I can't even think
of making dinner.

13:43.565 --> 13:45.182
Well, I didn't hear
what you just said,

13:45.183 --> 13:46.734
but what's the dinner situation?

13:46.735 --> 13:48.736
¶ ¶

13:48.737 --> 13:51.572
<i>Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker,</i>
<i>transitioning into my sad voice</i>

13:51.573 --> 13:53.240
<i>for the death of a white girl.</i>

13:53.241 --> 13:56.002
<i>Local white girl Connie D'Amico</i>
<i>died at the scene</i>

13:56.003 --> 13:58.195
<i>of an automobile accident</i>
<i>earlier tonight,</i>

13:58.196 --> 14:01.174
<i>the brake lines of Connie's</i>
<i>Celica apparently cut.</i>

14:01.175 --> 14:03.492
Oh, my God. How horrible!

14:03.493 --> 14:05.661
(exhales)
Can you imagine being the shovel

14:05.662 --> 14:08.831
that gets to scrape that ass
off the road?

14:08.832 --> 14:11.291
Eh, maybe in my next life.

14:11.292 --> 14:12.017
(knock on door)

14:13.336 --> 14:16.505
Lois Griffin, I'm sorry,
but you're under arrest.

14:16.506 --> 14:19.174
I'm gonna have to take you down
to the station.

14:19.175 --> 14:20.843
On what charge?

14:20.844 --> 14:22.603
We've got you
on grocery store video

14:22.604 --> 14:24.179
threatening Connie D'Amico.

14:24.180 --> 14:26.032
You're under arrest
for her murder.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.558
What?!

14:27.559 --> 14:30.945
Guys, my mom was arrested
for Connie's murder.

14:30.946 --> 14:32.896
No quiz!

14:32.897 --> 14:34.331
(all cheering)

14:44.325 --> 14:45.742
Joe, this is ridiculous.

14:45.743 --> 14:47.536
There's no way
Lois killed Connie.

14:47.537 --> 14:49.204
There's just too much evidence
against her.

14:49.205 --> 14:50.631
I got to take her in.

14:50.632 --> 14:52.875
So, what, I'm supposed to be
a guy without a wife now?

14:52.876 --> 14:55.728
What am I supposed to do,
whatever I want whenever I want?

14:55.729 --> 14:58.064
I'm gonna get crow's-feet
from smiling too much.

14:58.065 --> 15:00.424
Sorry, Peter. It's gonna be
quite an adjustment.

15:00.425 --> 15:02.885
Seriously, who's gonna greet me
in a shapeless sweatshirt

15:02.886 --> 15:04.887
- when I come home?
- Meg, maybe.

15:04.888 --> 15:07.431
Who's gonna slap a tarantula
of shampoo hair

15:07.432 --> 15:08.765
on the wall of the shower?

15:08.766 --> 15:10.225
It's the little things you miss.

15:10.226 --> 15:12.486
Who's gonna go, "Ooh! Ooh!
Careful!" while I'm parking?

15:12.487 --> 15:14.989
Sometimes this is
the hardest part of my job.

15:14.990 --> 15:17.900
Who's gonna fill up my DVR
with lady judge programs?

15:17.901 --> 15:19.326
I-I don't make the rules.

15:19.327 --> 15:21.829
Oh, and I suppose now I'll have
to start every road trip

15:21.830 --> 15:24.331
- with a full tank of gas?
- I took an oath, Peter.

15:24.332 --> 15:26.667
What am I supposed to do?
Masturbate comfortably in bed?

15:26.668 --> 15:28.076
The law's the law.

15:28.077 --> 15:30.454
And I guess I'm gonna have to be
on time to every party

15:30.455 --> 15:32.840
- and stay real late?
- Yeah, why do they do that?

15:32.841 --> 15:35.083
And so long,
<i>Handmaid's Tale,</i> I guess.

15:35.084 --> 15:36.844
Two or three more jokes, Peter.

15:36.845 --> 15:38.179
So long,<i> This Is Us.</i>

15:38.180 --> 15:39.346
Last one, maybe.

15:39.347 --> 15:41.256
So long, seeing my dining room.

15:41.257 --> 15:42.633
You got a stronger one
to end on?

15:42.634 --> 15:45.093
So long,
bitchy 2:00 a.m. blanket pulls.

15:45.094 --> 15:46.446
Ah, there we go.

15:46.447 --> 15:48.989
(bleep), Peter.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.267
What am I supposed to do now,
Brian?

15:52.268 --> 15:54.195
Whatever I want whenever I want?

15:54.196 --> 15:56.271
Yeah, I was right here
when you were doing that.

15:56.272 --> 15:58.482
Oh.
I-I didn't hear your laugh.

15:58.483 --> 16:00.375
I'm more of a smile guy.

16:04.155 --> 16:06.490
Peter, we have got to prove
Lois is innocent.

16:06.491 --> 16:08.375
That's right.
And the best way to crack

16:08.376 --> 16:10.327
any high-profile crime case

16:10.328 --> 16:13.288
is to do a podcast
before you have all the facts.

16:13.289 --> 16:15.290
- Okay.
- And the key to any podcast

16:15.291 --> 16:18.126
is poor sound quality
and tons of commercials.

16:18.127 --> 16:19.720
All right, we've got Lois
calling in from prison.

16:19.721 --> 16:21.481
She's only got three minutes.

16:21.482 --> 16:23.483
<i>LOIS (staticky):</i>
<i>Thanks for looking</i>
<i>at my case, guys.</i>

16:23.484 --> 16:25.392
You bet, Lois.
My first question is...

16:25.393 --> 16:27.177
do you get a good night's sleep?

16:27.178 --> 16:30.231
<i>No, 'cause I'm in prison,</i>
<i>and my cellmate is bipolar.</i>

16:30.232 --> 16:32.349
Well, if you get
a Casper mattress now,

16:32.350 --> 16:34.017
you have a hundred days
to decide

16:34.018 --> 16:35.477
if it's the right mattress
for you.

16:35.478 --> 16:37.163
<i>Peter,</i>
<i>I don't have time for this.</i>

16:37.164 --> 16:39.165
I don't have time
for underwear that bunches up.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.858
That's why I wear MeUndies.
Perfect underwear

16:41.859 --> 16:43.577
for hanging yourself
in your jail cell.

16:43.578 --> 16:46.339
<i>Can we talk about the case?</i>
<i>I have 30 seconds</i>

16:46.340 --> 16:48.841
<i>before they haul me off</i>
<i>to the freaking cafeteria.</i>

16:48.842 --> 16:50.751
Sounds like
you could use Blue Apron.

16:50.752 --> 16:53.370
Have you ever wanted to receive
a vegetable in the mail?

16:53.371 --> 16:54.922
Then you need Blue Apron.

16:54.923 --> 16:56.832
I'm, like, obsessed
with the stir-fry.

16:56.833 --> 16:59.001
Brian here
likes the Moroccan beef.

16:59.002 --> 17:01.837
I-I have no opinion
on the Moroccan beef, Peter.

17:01.838 --> 17:04.006
Brian, this is not art.
This is commerce.

17:04.007 --> 17:06.174
<i>Peter, before I go,</i>
<i>I need a new lawyer.</i>

17:06.175 --> 17:08.361
<i>This one made</i>
<i>a sexual pass at me.</i>

17:08.362 --> 17:10.863
Oh, boy. Everyone knows
hiring is a nightmare.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.940
At least it was
before ZipRecruiter.

17:12.941 --> 17:16.059
ZipRecruiter:
we vastly overestimate

17:16.060 --> 17:19.579
how many podcast listeners are
in a position to hire someone.

17:22.784 --> 17:24.526
Okay, Brian,
let's go through Lois's drawers

17:24.527 --> 17:26.878
and look for clues.
If you find any, let me know.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.031
And if you find
the yo-yo she took from me,

17:29.032 --> 17:30.716
definitely let me know.

17:30.717 --> 17:31.884
Stupid Lois.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.460
I'm not gonna use it
in the house.

17:33.461 --> 17:35.370
The Wendy's employee
gave it to me

17:35.371 --> 17:36.872
if I promised to calm down.

17:36.873 --> 17:38.206
Peter, this is a dead end.

17:38.207 --> 17:40.393
All I see here is your Nerf gun
from last summer.

17:40.394 --> 17:42.803
Oh, no way.
She said I lost that.

17:42.804 --> 17:45.139
She deserves to be in jail.

17:45.140 --> 17:46.140
PETER:
Hey!

17:46.141 --> 17:47.883
Suck on that, Lois!

17:47.884 --> 17:49.977
That was very close
to my eyes, Peter.

17:49.978 --> 17:51.645
It wasn't close to your eye.

17:51.646 --> 17:54.781
- That's why I took it.
- It was so far from your eye.

17:58.102 --> 17:59.320
What are we doing here?

17:59.321 --> 18:01.080
Connie never went
to the Drunken Clam.

18:01.081 --> 18:03.732
Doesn't matter. Everybody knows
the way you solve a murder

18:03.733 --> 18:05.901
is to ask a barkeep
if he knows anything.

18:05.902 --> 18:07.661
When he says no,
you turn around,

18:07.662 --> 18:10.447
and then he says "wait"
and gives you an important clue.

18:10.448 --> 18:13.283
Hey, Jerome, do you know
anything about Connie's death?

18:13.284 --> 18:15.836
No, man.
I've just been working here.

18:15.837 --> 18:17.412
All right, Brian.
Let's get out of here.

18:17.413 --> 18:19.340
- Peter, wait.
- Yes?

18:19.341 --> 18:22.584
One of the waitresses says
you put her tip down her pants.

18:22.585 --> 18:26.013
Huh. How long were you planning
to sit on that little nugget?

18:26.014 --> 18:27.422
You just did it.

18:27.423 --> 18:28.515
Okay, Jerome.

18:28.516 --> 18:30.425
If you <i> remember</i> anything else,

18:30.426 --> 18:33.279
here's my number.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.197
Oh, and here's a nickel
for the watered-down beer.

18:37.618 --> 18:39.576
Keep the change.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.124
How are we gonna solve
this case, Peter?

18:45.125 --> 18:46.292
I've been thinking about that.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.819
You're a dog,
and I'm a man. Right?

18:48.820 --> 18:50.278
So we're basically <i> Scooby-Doo.</i>

18:50.279 --> 18:52.322
- So, what are you saying?
- We go around town

18:52.323 --> 18:55.450
and rip off faces
until we find the real killer.

18:55.451 --> 18:56.877
Unless...

18:56.878 --> 18:58.995
(screams)

18:58.996 --> 19:00.714
Which can only mean...

19:00.715 --> 19:02.332
(screams)

19:02.333 --> 19:04.334
Twins? Guess again.

19:04.335 --> 19:06.061
(both scream)

19:15.805 --> 19:18.823
The newspaper
is embarrassing me.

19:23.571 --> 19:25.665
Well, kids, we tried.

19:25.666 --> 19:27.908
I'm afraid
your mother's a murderer.

19:27.909 --> 19:30.026
No, Peter, I'm right here.

19:30.027 --> 19:31.578
Lois, you escaped!

19:31.579 --> 19:33.488
Careful, kids.
She killed before.

19:33.489 --> 19:35.866
- She'll kill again.
- JOE: No, Peter, look wider.

19:35.867 --> 19:37.510
We're all here.

19:37.511 --> 19:39.178
Turns out
Lois didn't kill anyone.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.514
Connie D'Amico
faked her own death.

19:41.515 --> 19:43.257
- (all gasp)
- Gasp!

19:43.258 --> 19:46.018
We found Connie an hour ago
at a motel outside of town.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.262
Turns out she put a pig
in a blonde wig

19:48.263 --> 19:49.747
behind the wheel of her car.

19:49.748 --> 19:53.100
I'm sorry, our coroner
has been pretty sloppy lately.

19:53.101 --> 19:55.635
She's been dealing
with some substance abuse.

19:55.636 --> 19:57.938
"She"?
Interesting.

19:57.939 --> 20:00.223
Anyway, Lois has been cleared
of all charges.

20:00.224 --> 20:01.725
And what of the pig?

20:01.726 --> 20:04.160
That was a very tough
house call.

20:08.232 --> 20:10.617
- Yes?
- Excuse me, folks.

20:10.618 --> 20:12.286
Do you have a daughter
named Peppa?

20:12.287 --> 20:13.879
Yes.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.256
You're gonna want to sit down.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.465
Well, Lois, I got to say,

20:24.466 --> 20:26.225
it's great to have you home
from prison.

20:26.226 --> 20:27.709
Ah, it's great to be home.

20:27.710 --> 20:29.252
Hey, I-I got to ask,

20:29.253 --> 20:31.213
are-are you gonna stay
that jacked forever?

20:31.214 --> 20:32.565
I don't know.
Do you like it?

20:32.566 --> 20:35.309
I-I-I do and I don't, you know?

20:35.310 --> 20:37.928
It-it was... it was nice
being held up against a wall,

20:37.929 --> 20:41.223
but when you made me suck
the hairdryer, I-I...

20:41.224 --> 20:42.633
I enjoyed it, I did,

20:42.634 --> 20:45.560
but I-I don't want to do
that specific thing again.

20:45.561 --> 20:47.729
Well, that's too bad,
'cause I'm ready for round two.

20:47.730 --> 20:50.123
Just got to make sure
the kids don't come in.

20:53.110 --> 20:54.945
- (whimpers)
- Now no one can get in,

20:54.946 --> 20:56.422
and no one can get out.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.073
Hands on the headboard, chief.

20:58.074 --> 20:59.591
Yes, ma'am.
