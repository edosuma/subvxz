WEBVTT

00:02.567 --> 00:04.091
Previously on
The Big Bang Theory...

00:04.134 --> 00:06.267
Uh, we sort of have another
reason for asking you here.

00:07.398 --> 00:09.096
We want to have a baby,

00:09.139 --> 00:11.054
but we can't do it
on our own.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.055
Okay, whoa, whoa.

00:12.099 --> 00:13.274
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:13.317 --> 00:15.102
Yeah, this has been
such a nice evening.

00:15.145 --> 00:18.061
Let's all just stop before
anyone says any more things.

00:18.105 --> 00:19.497
Leonard, would you be
the father of our baby?

00:19.541 --> 00:21.673
Oh, you said a thing.

00:23.632 --> 00:26.461
Thank you, guys, again
for agreeing to do this.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.724
Yeah, it means
so much to us.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.421
Ah, we're happy
we can help.

00:30.465 --> 00:33.076
Yeah, and we don't find it
weird at all.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.773
It's a little weird
for us, too.

00:34.817 --> 00:36.949
I mean, instead of our baby
looking like Zack,

00:36.993 --> 00:39.343
it's gonna look
like Leonard.

00:40.257 --> 00:42.564
Or Penny if it's a girl.

00:44.566 --> 00:46.176
No, no, it's not gonna look...

00:47.134 --> 00:49.266
Sure.

00:50.267 --> 00:51.529
But I promise,

00:51.573 --> 00:54.184
we're gonna be
really good parents.
Mm-hmm.

00:54.228 --> 00:55.664
Oh, we know you will.

00:55.707 --> 00:57.318
So, what is the next step?Yeah.

00:57.361 --> 00:59.755
Well, Leonard, we were hoping
you'd go in on Monday.

00:59.798 --> 01:00.799
Okay.

01:00.843 --> 01:02.236
And they say,
for the best results,

01:02.279 --> 01:03.933
between now and then,
you shouldn't have sex.

01:03.976 --> 01:05.413
ZACK:
Sorry, bro,

01:05.456 --> 01:07.806
I know it seems impossible
to go for five days without,

01:07.850 --> 01:10.244
but I believe in you.

01:10.287 --> 01:13.464
Five days?
My record is 24 years.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.207
Uh, I think that also means
no flying solo.

01:17.251 --> 01:18.208
Oh.

01:18.252 --> 01:21.733
Then my record is 14 years.

01:21.777 --> 01:24.040
And, well, we're really
hoping for a son.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.347
So just, like, keep that in mind
when you're in there.

01:26.390 --> 01:30.394
Yeah, just think, "Little
boys, little boys."

01:32.614 --> 01:35.530
Still just
totally not weird.

01:35.573 --> 01:37.184
Hello.

01:37.227 --> 01:39.186
Oh, hey, Sheldon. We're kind of
in the middle of something.

01:39.229 --> 01:41.449
Oh, I won't be a moment.
I just need to grab a book

01:41.492 --> 01:43.015
off a high shelf, which I can do

01:43.059 --> 01:45.496
because I am both
tall and smart.

01:47.194 --> 01:49.152
Sheldon, come home!

01:49.196 --> 01:51.763
They don't want
to have your baby!

01:51.807 --> 01:53.287
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.463
Oh-oh, dear, I think
I got something in my eye.

01:55.506 --> 01:57.943
My piercing, blue eye.

01:59.075 --> 02:01.469
Sheldon!
Fine.

02:01.512 --> 02:05.473
I've also never had a cavity
and I don't have asthma...

02:32.456 --> 02:36.504
So, this week
would have been my wedding

02:36.547 --> 02:39.811
if Anu and I hadn't decided
to slow things down.

02:39.855 --> 02:42.727
Oh, yeah, I would have
forgotten, except for those

02:42.771 --> 02:45.687
nonrefundable airline tickets
to India I bought.

02:45.730 --> 02:46.862
I'm sorry.

02:46.905 --> 02:50.692
No, no. What's $3,000
between friends?

02:50.735 --> 02:52.215
Yeah, I probably
would've just

02:52.259 --> 02:54.826
thrown it away on health care
for my children.

02:56.001 --> 02:58.308
Uh, if you still want to go,
you can go to India

02:58.352 --> 03:01.224
and help my dad eat
all the nonrefundable sushi.

03:01.268 --> 03:03.357
Indian sushi?

03:03.400 --> 03:06.360
I need a change of underwear
just thinking about that.

03:06.403 --> 03:09.624
I really think
we made the right decision.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.756
Agreed, although
I did have

03:11.800 --> 03:14.542
a pretty awesome bachelor party
planned for this weekend.

03:14.585 --> 03:15.543
Really? What was it?

03:15.586 --> 03:16.892
Well, I used my NASA connections

03:16.935 --> 03:19.024
to get us four seats
on that plane

03:19.068 --> 03:21.375
that lets you experience
weightlessness.

03:21.418 --> 03:24.465
The Vomit Comet.
That is so cool.

03:24.508 --> 03:26.728
I've always wanted
to experience weightlessness.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.730
The closest I ever came
was that time

03:28.773 --> 03:31.298
I accidentally set my scale
to kilograms.

03:33.300 --> 03:36.128
I know, it would've
been fun, but, hey,

03:36.172 --> 03:39.871
the next time you decide to
marry a woman you barely know.

03:39.915 --> 03:41.264
We could still go.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.397
You know, make it
a guys' weekend.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.747
Yeah.
All right, let's do it.

03:45.790 --> 03:48.489
Great. It'll be like
the good old days.

03:48.532 --> 03:51.970
You mean when we were all sad,
desperate and horribly alone?

03:53.624 --> 03:55.800
I remember it more fondly.

03:58.325 --> 04:01.241
Leonard, if you had
food on your face,

04:01.284 --> 04:02.372
would you want me to tell you?

04:02.416 --> 04:05.549
Where? Did I get it?

04:05.593 --> 04:07.986
Oh, no, not now;
it was last week.

04:09.205 --> 04:10.728
I didn't know
whether or not to tell you,

04:10.772 --> 04:12.600
but everyone was staring.

04:12.643 --> 04:15.298
For the record,
it was right there.

04:15.342 --> 04:17.953
And it was Nutella.

04:17.996 --> 04:18.997
Thanks.

04:19.041 --> 04:20.999
You looked like
a hazelnut Hitler.

04:22.349 --> 04:24.916
Hey, who wants to hear
some exciting news?

04:24.960 --> 04:26.309
Oh, what's up?

04:26.353 --> 04:29.573
This weekend, I got us
four seats on the Vomit Comet.

04:29.617 --> 04:32.446
Oh, you lost me at "vomit,"
you lost me again at "comet,"

04:32.489 --> 04:35.275
and to be honest, I was
on the fence at "us."

04:36.754 --> 04:38.626
Yeah, I can't go either.
Penny's dad is visiting

04:38.669 --> 04:40.715
from Nebraska, and I haven't
seen him for a while.

04:40.758 --> 04:42.804
Oh, that's nice
you guys get along.

04:42.847 --> 04:45.502
I forget, Howard, does your
father-in-law still hate you?

04:47.678 --> 04:49.114
WOLOWITZ:
He doesn't hate me.

04:49.158 --> 04:50.681
He's just disappointed

04:50.725 --> 04:53.293
that I'm not
any other man on the planet.

04:54.598 --> 04:58.123
That's how I feel about
Ben Affleck as Batman.

04:59.342 --> 05:00.343
Well, these two are out.

05:00.387 --> 05:01.692
There goes
our guys' weekend.

05:01.736 --> 05:03.999
Okay, so let's make it
a couples' weekend.

05:04.042 --> 05:05.479
I'll bring Anu,
you bring Bernadette.

05:05.522 --> 05:06.741
I'm not sure
Bernie would like it.

05:06.784 --> 05:08.743
Maybe I'll invite
Stuart or Bert.

05:08.786 --> 05:10.222
SHELDON:
Oh, go with Bert!

05:10.266 --> 05:12.921
He's huge. It'd be fun to
watch him float around.

05:14.052 --> 05:15.750
Like that time the
Underdog balloon

05:15.793 --> 05:18.318
got away at the
Macy's Parade.

05:20.972 --> 05:22.844
Hey. What are those?

05:22.887 --> 05:24.236
Oh, vitamins.

05:24.280 --> 05:27.370
Zack wants me to take them
to increase my virility.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.807
Zack used the word "virility"?

05:31.809 --> 05:34.595
He may have said
"wiener power."

05:36.901 --> 05:38.338
Okay, that's my dad.

05:38.381 --> 05:40.644
Now, remember, do not bring up
any baby stuff, all right?

05:40.688 --> 05:42.820
Not me not wanting one,
not you having one with Zack.

05:42.864 --> 05:44.518
Got it.And if he brings it up,
change the subject

05:44.561 --> 05:46.171
to literally anything else.I got it.

05:46.215 --> 05:49.392
But not the Cornhuskers.
Do not discuss the Cornhuskers.

05:49.436 --> 05:52.308
Is that a sports team?

05:52.352 --> 05:53.918
Never mind, you're good.

05:55.442 --> 05:57.400
Daddy! Hi.Hey, Slugger.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.054
Aw.

05:59.097 --> 06:01.796
Hey, Wyatt.
Leonard.

06:01.839 --> 06:03.754
Hey, that's a hell
of a handshake.

06:03.798 --> 06:06.583
Ah, well, you know,
I've been taking vitamins.

06:06.627 --> 06:09.281
Dad, uh, come on in,
sit down.

06:09.325 --> 06:11.414
Can I get you something
to drink? Maybe a beer?

06:11.458 --> 06:13.242
Sure, if you're having one.Okay.

06:13.285 --> 06:15.287
And why wouldn't you,
since you're not pregnant?

06:17.289 --> 06:19.422
Um...

06:19.466 --> 06:22.033
Leonard wants to have a baby
with my ex-boyfriend Zack.

06:27.604 --> 06:30.433
How 'bout those Cornhuskers?

06:34.002 --> 06:38.354
Hey, would you mind if Raj
and I went away this weekend?

06:38.398 --> 06:42.010
Well, it is important for you
two to keep the spark alive.

06:42.053 --> 06:45.274
No, just the bachelor party
I had planned.

06:45.317 --> 06:46.928
I thought we'd do it anyway.

06:46.971 --> 06:48.408
Oh, so a guys' weekend?

06:48.451 --> 06:50.453
Kinda. I mean, Sheldon
and Leonard couldn't make it,

06:50.497 --> 06:52.803
so Raj invited Anu
and I asked Stuart.

06:54.501 --> 06:57.112
Wait, you invited Stuart
before me?

06:57.155 --> 06:58.766
Actually, I invited Bert
before Stuart,

06:58.809 --> 07:01.464
but I don't know why
I just told you that.

07:01.508 --> 07:03.118
Why didn't you invite me?

07:03.161 --> 07:05.773
Because
I know you.

07:05.816 --> 07:09.254
You don't want to float
weightless in an airplane.

07:09.298 --> 07:10.473
What are you
talking about?

07:10.517 --> 07:12.083
I love doing crazy
stuff like that.

07:12.127 --> 07:15.870
Bernie, you got sick from
the teacup ride at Disneyland.

07:15.913 --> 07:17.611
Lots of people do.

07:17.654 --> 07:20.222
We were still in line.

07:20.265 --> 07:21.876
So you don't want me to go?

07:21.919 --> 07:24.661
No, I want you to go
if you're gonna have fun.

07:24.705 --> 07:27.142
I don't want you to go
if you're gonna be miserable

07:27.185 --> 07:29.187
and ruin it for everyone.

07:30.014 --> 07:31.886
Which is a long way of saying

07:31.929 --> 07:33.540
I want you to go!

07:36.107 --> 07:38.849
: I think this is
going pretty good, huh?

07:41.765 --> 07:44.681
Maybe for you.
You threw me under the bus.

07:44.725 --> 07:46.640
Oh, I'm sorry. I panicked.
He was judging me.

07:46.683 --> 07:48.424
Well, yeah, now he's judging me.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.817
I know. It worked.

07:51.340 --> 07:54.604
You two might want to talk
louder or quieter.

07:54.648 --> 07:57.346
In high school, he could
hear me open a can of beer

07:57.389 --> 07:58.695
in my closet
under a blanket.

08:02.307 --> 08:05.485
So let me get this
straight, Leonard.

08:05.528 --> 08:07.008
She doesn't want
to have your baby,

08:07.051 --> 08:10.011
but her dumbbell
ex-boyfriend does.

08:10.054 --> 08:13.362
Well, I-- no, I wouldn't
say it like that.

08:13.405 --> 08:14.711
How would you say it?

08:16.365 --> 08:18.585
Uh, same words, just less angry.

08:19.716 --> 08:21.936
Well, I don't know
about Los Angeles,

08:21.979 --> 08:24.982
but in Nebraska,
that's kind of strange.

08:25.026 --> 08:28.464
It's strange here, too,
and we have a bakery for dogs.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.379
And you're okay with this?

08:30.422 --> 08:31.859
I support my husband.Thank you.

08:31.902 --> 08:33.121
But, you know,
if you think differently,

08:33.164 --> 08:34.383
you should feel free
to say so.

08:34.426 --> 08:37.865
You know, just like, "Ah!"
Make a scene.

08:37.908 --> 08:41.564
Okay, look, they can't
have kids of their own,

08:41.608 --> 08:42.913
and they like
that I'm smart,

08:42.957 --> 08:44.567
and they want that
for their child.

08:44.611 --> 08:45.437
No, I get it.

08:45.481 --> 08:46.308
You do?

08:46.351 --> 08:47.527
Sure.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.746
Back on the farm,
we had a prize stallion.

08:49.790 --> 08:53.968
We didn't let that just go to
waste; we put him out to stud.

08:55.665 --> 08:58.538
No, no, this is... this is
a little different than that...

08:58.581 --> 09:01.410
No, no, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

09:01.453 --> 09:03.847
Uh, you were comparing me
to a prize stud. Go on.

09:10.854 --> 09:12.552
You have fun with

09:12.595 --> 09:13.901
your new best buddy?

09:13.944 --> 09:15.642
Hey, it's your fault
your dad likes me.

09:15.685 --> 09:17.644
You dated idiots
your whole life.

09:17.687 --> 09:20.342
Well, he was right
about one thing.

09:20.385 --> 09:23.563
I am married to a stud.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.608
Mm. Really?

09:25.652 --> 09:27.349
Yeah, I felt so bad
about selling you out,

09:27.392 --> 09:29.612
I thought I would
maybe make it up to you.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.270
Wait, wait. I can't.

09:35.313 --> 09:36.663
I mean, I want to,

09:36.706 --> 09:38.621
but I'm not supposed to
for the next three days.

09:38.665 --> 09:41.581
Oh. That's right.
I forgot.

09:41.624 --> 09:44.061
All right, well, guess
I'll just read a little

09:44.105 --> 09:46.107
and then-- I don't
know-- go to sleep.

09:50.372 --> 09:53.375
Really? That's what
you're sleeping in?

09:53.418 --> 09:54.594
Oh, you want me to take it off?

09:54.637 --> 09:56.204
No.

09:56.247 --> 09:57.640
All right.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.990
Well, then pipe down
and let me read my comic book.

10:01.078 --> 10:03.385
Penny, I-I know
what you're doing.

10:03.428 --> 10:04.255
Just please stop.

10:04.299 --> 10:06.475
Ooh, listen to this.

10:06.518 --> 10:07.694
"Bam.

10:07.737 --> 10:08.869
"Pow.

10:08.912 --> 10:11.088
Take that, Batman."

10:14.265 --> 10:15.919
Thanks again for
doing this, guys.

10:15.963 --> 10:18.052
Of course.So excited.

10:18.095 --> 10:19.793
I'm glad you came.

10:19.836 --> 10:22.012
Howard made it sound like
this wasn't your kind of thing.

10:22.056 --> 10:23.710
He did say that, but here I am.

10:23.753 --> 10:25.712
So what does he know?

10:25.755 --> 10:27.801
I'm sorry. I just...

10:27.844 --> 10:29.803
didn't think you'd enjoy
plummeting to the Earth

10:29.846 --> 10:31.152
at 400 miles an hour.

10:31.195 --> 10:32.893
I love going fast,

10:32.936 --> 10:34.242
unlike Grandma here,

10:34.285 --> 10:35.896
poking along
at 70 miles an hour.

10:35.939 --> 10:37.288
Am I right?

10:38.550 --> 10:40.727
I've always wanted
to do this.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.685
I'm an adrenaline junkie.

10:42.729 --> 10:44.121
Roller coasters, snowboarding,

10:44.165 --> 10:47.429
dating men
who bathe with their dogs.

10:47.472 --> 10:50.345
It was during a drought.

10:51.389 --> 10:53.087
I'm a thrill-seeker, too.

10:53.130 --> 10:55.176
I've had to pull back
since I became a mom,

10:55.219 --> 10:57.744
but I'll still jump on the back
of a grocery cart

10:57.787 --> 11:00.834
and just roll
through the meat section.

11:01.878 --> 11:03.097
And I'm married
to her,

11:03.140 --> 11:05.795
which is quite
the ride.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.055
Amy?

12:33.753 --> 12:36.930
There's something out here.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.758
Just trap it
under a cup,

12:38.801 --> 12:41.108
and I'll be there
in a minute.

12:41.151 --> 12:44.633
I'll try, but
it's Leonard.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.156
What?

12:48.855 --> 12:50.813
Well, what is
he doing here?

12:50.857 --> 12:52.380
I told you, if we left
pizza on the counter,

12:52.423 --> 12:54.469
we'd attract
something.

12:55.513 --> 12:56.950
Oh, hey, guys.

12:56.993 --> 12:58.473
Sorry. I used my key.

12:58.516 --> 13:00.301
I just needed
a place to crash.

13:00.344 --> 13:01.824
Is everything okay?

13:01.868 --> 13:03.173
Yeah, I...

13:03.217 --> 13:05.132
had to get out of the apartment.

13:05.175 --> 13:08.309
My wife kept trying
to have sex with me.

13:09.353 --> 13:10.528
Been there.

13:16.883 --> 13:19.450
Why are you trying
to avoid having sex?

13:19.494 --> 13:21.191
Well, we just did it
three weeks ago.I was talking

13:21.235 --> 13:22.845
to Leonard!

13:25.282 --> 13:26.893
Well, I-I have to go
to the clinic

13:26.936 --> 13:28.459
for Zack and Marissa on Monday,

13:28.503 --> 13:31.245
and I'm supposed
to save myself until then.

13:31.288 --> 13:35.902
Sounds like maybe Penny's not
totally on board with that plan.

13:35.945 --> 13:38.078
Well, she said she was.

13:38.121 --> 13:42.082
But she also said
I looked dope.

13:43.518 --> 13:47.130
Honestly, I don't even
think I looked fly.

13:47.174 --> 13:48.653
So you're willing
to go through with this,

13:48.697 --> 13:50.786
even though
she clearly has reservations?

13:50.830 --> 13:52.005
If she has a problem,

13:52.048 --> 13:54.224
she should say something.

13:54.268 --> 13:55.225
She tried to seduce you.

13:55.269 --> 13:56.226
If that's not a cry for help,

13:56.270 --> 13:57.967
I don't know what is.

13:59.403 --> 14:01.884
Penny doesn't want
to have kids.

14:01.928 --> 14:03.494
I respect that.

14:03.538 --> 14:06.976
But this is my chance to
leave a part of me behind.

14:07.020 --> 14:10.545
Okay, but this isn't
gonna make you a dad.

14:10.588 --> 14:12.982
It's gonna be
their baby, not yours.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.723
Although,
someday,

14:14.766 --> 14:16.725
if that kid wants
to know why he's short,

14:16.768 --> 14:19.206
nearsighted, and asthmatic...

14:20.424 --> 14:22.687
...he may hunt you down.

14:25.647 --> 14:29.607
Are you guys ready for the most
intense experience of your life?

14:29.651 --> 14:31.218
Yes.Definitely.

14:31.261 --> 14:32.523
Not to brag, but
I'm an astronaut,

14:32.567 --> 14:34.351
so I've been
weightless before.

14:34.395 --> 14:36.440
Can be pretty scary.

14:37.485 --> 14:39.443
Please, I'm, like, 90 pounds.

14:39.487 --> 14:43.447
I'm weightless every time
I hold more than three balloons.

14:43.491 --> 14:46.102
Okay, I just need you guys
to sign these waivers,

14:46.146 --> 14:47.582
and then you
can go get changed.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.410
There are a lot
of pages here.

14:49.453 --> 14:52.195
Is this a waiver or a screenplay
you've been working on?

14:53.153 --> 14:55.068
I'm sure it's just
boilerplate.

14:55.111 --> 14:57.853
Absolutely. It's to protect us
in case of injury.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.595
It says, "Or death."

15:02.292 --> 15:04.947
Which is awesome.

15:06.209 --> 15:08.168
Done.Where are the
changing rooms?

15:08.211 --> 15:10.605
Dressing rooms
are in the back.

15:10.648 --> 15:12.650
No peeking.

15:15.001 --> 15:16.611
Here you go.

15:16.654 --> 15:18.918
Okay. Should we go get changed?

15:18.961 --> 15:20.920
Yeah. Hang on a second.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.312
What?

15:22.356 --> 15:24.097
Just--
I have two babies at home.

15:24.140 --> 15:25.533
What am I doing?

15:25.576 --> 15:27.187
If you don't want to do this,

15:27.230 --> 15:28.579
then why'd you come?

15:28.623 --> 15:30.103
To prove to Howard
that he doesn't know me as well

15:30.146 --> 15:32.453
as he thinks he does.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.281
Looks like he does.

15:34.324 --> 15:37.632
Unless I do it
and then he doesn't.

15:37.675 --> 15:40.852
Why not just be honest?

15:40.896 --> 15:42.506
You're right.

15:42.550 --> 15:44.508
I should be honest.

15:44.552 --> 15:48.773
You owe me $3,000 for those
plane tickets to India!

15:54.127 --> 15:55.998
Hey.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.522
That was a long run.

15:58.566 --> 16:00.437
Yeah. Well,
I was in the zone.

16:00.481 --> 16:02.178
You know,
and then in a diner

16:02.222 --> 16:07.009
and then in a massage chair
at the mall where I fell asleep.

16:07.053 --> 16:09.272
Are you avoiding me?

16:09.316 --> 16:11.448
Well, I took a nap
next to Hot Dog on a Stick.

16:11.492 --> 16:12.972
What do you think?

16:14.712 --> 16:18.020
I think you're mad at me
and Leonard,

16:18.064 --> 16:21.284
but maybe... you're really mad
at yourself.

16:21.328 --> 16:23.417
Why would I be
mad at myself?

16:23.460 --> 16:27.029
'Cause you regret
this "no baby" plan of yours.

16:27.073 --> 16:28.161
You know, it's
pretty crappy of you

16:28.204 --> 16:29.466
to make me feel
bad about this.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.425
I'm not trying
to make you feel bad.

16:31.468 --> 16:34.863
But... do you?

16:35.864 --> 16:37.039
Yes.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.867
I feel like I'm
letting everybody down.

16:38.910 --> 16:40.260
Hate disappointing Leonard,

16:40.303 --> 16:42.479
but I really hate
disappointing you.

16:42.523 --> 16:44.873
Oh, Slugger, you could
never disappoint me.

16:47.136 --> 16:50.792
Okay, your high school years
were a little rough.

16:51.793 --> 16:53.621
And I'm sorry about that.

16:53.664 --> 16:55.014
There was you
sneaking out at night

16:55.057 --> 16:56.972
and your boyfriends
sneaking out in the morning.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.843
I said sorry.

16:58.887 --> 17:00.889
That time you got drunk
and stole a horse.

17:00.932 --> 17:02.412
Yeah.

17:02.456 --> 17:03.892
I was there.
I remember.

17:03.935 --> 17:05.720
Parts of it.

17:05.763 --> 17:08.114
But besides all that,

17:08.157 --> 17:11.073
being your dad is the best thing
ever happened to me.

17:12.118 --> 17:13.902
What about
Randall and Lisa?

17:14.946 --> 17:17.384
They're okay.

17:17.427 --> 17:19.603
I just don't want you
to miss out.

17:19.647 --> 17:21.605
I know.

17:21.649 --> 17:23.955
But if this is
really what you want--

17:23.999 --> 17:25.740
or don't want--

17:25.783 --> 17:27.350
I'm on your side.

17:27.394 --> 17:29.396
Thanks.

17:32.094 --> 17:32.921
Hey.

17:32.964 --> 17:34.096
Hey.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.272
Uh, Wyatt, we need to talk.

17:36.316 --> 17:37.969
Sure. What's up?

17:38.013 --> 17:41.060
I want you to back off.

17:41.103 --> 17:44.454
You know? I-If Penny and I don't
have kids, that's between us.

17:44.498 --> 17:46.456
So you need
to stay out of it.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.241
Oh, Leonard, it's okay.
We talked. We're good.

17:49.285 --> 17:50.765
Oh.

17:53.942 --> 17:57.293
Okay, you could've
stopped me sooner.

17:57.337 --> 17:59.078
Could've let
you go longer.

17:59.121 --> 18:00.818
Uh-huh.

18:00.862 --> 18:02.733
You did great, Leonard.
Very forceful.

18:02.777 --> 18:04.387
Yeah?

18:04.431 --> 18:08.087
I-I-I felt like my voice
was a little shaky there.

18:09.827 --> 18:11.916
Um...

18:11.960 --> 18:14.528
Hey, I decided
to not go through

18:14.571 --> 18:17.096
with this Zack
and Marissa thing.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.314
Really?

18:18.358 --> 18:20.142
But you were
so excited about it.I know.

18:20.186 --> 18:21.839
But, um...

18:21.883 --> 18:24.146
I think I was just
fooling myself.

18:24.190 --> 18:28.237
I-I would be heartbroken
if I had a kid out there

18:28.281 --> 18:30.326
and I wasn't his dad.

18:30.370 --> 18:32.198
I know you would.

18:32.241 --> 18:34.025
Yeah.

18:36.071 --> 18:38.334
: So, that thing
you wanted to do last night,

18:38.378 --> 18:41.250
I'm available.

18:41.294 --> 18:43.557
I got real good hearing there,
stud.

18:46.255 --> 18:48.953
All right,
everyone's suited up.

18:48.997 --> 18:50.694
Let's head out
to the tarmac!

18:50.738 --> 18:52.609
Actually, one second.

18:52.653 --> 18:55.482
Howie, I don't think
I should do this.

18:55.525 --> 18:56.831
Really?

18:56.874 --> 19:00.226
Well, I did
not see that coming.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.185
Just-- We have kids,

19:03.229 --> 19:05.753
and it's not smart to
put us both in danger.

19:05.796 --> 19:06.754
That's a good point.

19:06.797 --> 19:08.277
When I was little,
my parents

19:08.321 --> 19:09.409
never flew together.

19:09.452 --> 19:10.758
We thought it was
because they loved us,

19:10.801 --> 19:13.543
but it turns out
they hated each other.

19:13.587 --> 19:15.415
See?

19:15.458 --> 19:17.417
I just think
I shouldn't go.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.158
Actually, this is much safer
than driving a car.

19:19.201 --> 19:21.072
Stay out of it, flyboy!

19:22.161 --> 19:24.293
You're right.

19:24.337 --> 19:26.295
But I've done this before.

19:26.339 --> 19:28.515
And since you really,
really want to go,

19:28.558 --> 19:29.733
I'll stay here.

19:30.778 --> 19:32.345
Oh. Great.

19:32.388 --> 19:35.217
Unless you don't want to because
I was right and I do know you.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.915
Well, if you really know me,
then you know how far I'll go

19:37.959 --> 19:39.221
to prove a point.Apparently,

19:39.265 --> 19:40.962
34,000 feet that way,
then straight back down,

19:41.005 --> 19:42.181
up and down,
over and over again

19:42.224 --> 19:44.748
until you throw up food
you didn't even eat.

19:46.010 --> 19:48.752
They are definitely
your weirdest friends.

19:48.796 --> 19:50.276
If only that were true.

19:54.497 --> 19:57.979
I hate this so much!

19:58.022 --> 20:00.590
Why am I doing this?!

20:00.634 --> 20:04.028
To prove a stupid point
to your husband!

20:04.072 --> 20:06.030
Oh, right. Worth it.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.344
Hey, Zack.

20:15.388 --> 20:19.000
Um, look, I-I know this
is gonna be disappointing,

20:19.043 --> 20:22.569
but, um, I-I can't do this.

20:22.612 --> 20:24.092
No, no, no, no.

20:24.135 --> 20:27.530
I-I, I know how.I just can't.

20:29.271 --> 20:30.577
But, hey, look,

20:30.620 --> 20:31.882
i-if you like,

20:31.926 --> 20:34.407
I-I know someone
who might be interested.

20:34.450 --> 20:37.410
No! Absolutely not!

20:39.412 --> 20:41.327
I'm sorry,
my wife says I'm not allowed.
