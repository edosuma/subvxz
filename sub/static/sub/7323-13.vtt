MM.

07:04.194 --> 07:06.156

INSTEAD OF ME?

07:06.156 --> 07:08.759
WELL, DR. SHEPHERD DIDN'T WANT
TO LEAVE ANYTHING TO CHANCE.

07:08.759 --> 07:10.831
NOW YOU CAN BOTH
GO TO HELL.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.833
MEREDITH, IT WAS OPEN

07:12.833 --> 07:15.205

07:18.469 --> 07:19.710

A GOOD DAY, DANIEL?
YES, I AM, DR. SHEPHERD.

07:30.581 --> 07:32.723
YOU GIVE ME THAT NEW WONDER DRUG
OF YOURS, I'LL BE EVEN BETTER.

07:32.723 --> 07:35.085
WELL, IF IT CAME DOWN TO
HOW MUCH I LIKE THE PATIENT,

07:35.085 --> 07:37.087
YOU'D BE A SHOO-IN.
(laughs)

07:37.087 --> 07:39.089
NOW IF DANIEL GETS THE DRUG,

07:39.089 --> 07:41.692
HOW SOON WILL HE STOP SLIPPING
IN AND OUT OF THINGS?

07:41.692 --> 07:43.694
WELL, AT THIS STAGE,
WE DON'T KNOW

07:43.694 --> 07:45.235
ANY MORE THAN YOU DO,
MRS. COBB.

07:45.235 --> 07:47.237
THAT'S WHY WE'RE GONNA DO
A 2-YEAR FOLLOW-UP.

07:47.237 --> 07:49.469
AND THE IDEA THAT HIS CONDITION
COULD BE REVERSED ALTOGETHER,

07:49.469 --> 07:52.102
IS THAT COMPLETELY
OUT OF THE QUESTION?

07:52.102 --> 07:53.704
BECAUSE I-I JUST READ

07:53.704 --> 07:56.106
THAT WHEN THE DRUG WAS USED
ON RATS AND MONKEYS...
MM-HMM.

07:56.106 --> 07:58.108
THERE WAS SOME REVERSAL
IN TISSUE DAMAGE.

07:58.108 --> 08:00.751
THAT'S RATS AND MONKEYS. IT
COULD BE DIFFERENT FOR HUMANS.

08:00.751 --> 08:03.113
(Derek) WELL, I DON'T WANT TO
RULE OUT A REVERSAL ALTOGETHER.

08:03.113 --> 08:05.516
BUT RIGHT NOW, WE'RE TRYING
TO STOP THE PROGRESSION.

08:05.516 --> 08:07.518
ALL RIGHT, DR. KAREV
IS GONNA TAKE YOU DOWN

08:07.518 --> 08:09.059
FOR AN M.R.I. LATER,

08:09.059 --> 08:12.623
SO IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE
QUESTIONS TODAY, PAGE HIM.

08:12.623 --> 08:16.126
(laughs) I'M FEELING BETTER
ALREADY, DR. SHEPHERD.

08:16.126 --> 08:18.128
HERE WE GO. (laughs)
(Derek) HERE WE GO.

08:18.128 --> 08:20.130
(slaps back)
A CLINICAL TRIAL'S

08:20.130 --> 08:22.132
A LITTLE DIFFERENT
THAN A REGULAR SURGERY.

08:22.132 --> 08:25.075
YOU CAN PAINT
A ROSIER PICTURE.
YEAH, I-I DIDN'T WANT
TO GIVE 'EM FALSE HOPE.

08:25.075 --> 08:27.678
YOU DIDN'T GIVE 'EM ANY HOPE.
LOOK, IF MRS. COBB THINKS

08:27.678 --> 08:29.780
THIS IS GONNA GIVE HER HUSBAND
A BETTER CHANCE,

08:29.780 --> 08:31.782
SHE'LL BE A BETTER CAREGIVER,
AND IN THE END,

08:31.782 --> 08:33.784
HE HAS A BETTER CHANCE
OF SUCCESS, OKAY?

08:33.784 --> 08:35.515
YES, SIR.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.618
GOOD.

08:37.618 --> 08:40.520
IS THAT ALL YOU'RE HAVING?
YEAH, I THINK SO. UM...

08:40.520 --> 08:42.923
(slurps)

08:42.923 --> 08:44.524

08:47.057 --> 08:49.830
MNH-MNH. CHIEF,
THIS IS MY MILKSHAKE TIME.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.902
MILKSHAKE TIME
IS NOT A THING.
(slurping)

08:51.902 --> 08:53.804
YOU DIDN'T BOTHER TO TELL ME

08:53.804 --> 08:55.806
THAT YOU WERE
BROADCASTING SURGERIES.

08:55.806 --> 08:58.569
OH, I DIDN'T THINK
IT'D BE A BIG DEAL.
WELL, IT IS.
WHAT IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG?

08:58.569 --> 09:00.641
LOOK, THE PATIENTS
WHO WANT TO DO IT

09:00.641 --> 09:02.613
SIGN A COMPREHENSIVE RELEASE.

09:02.613 --> 09:04.615
AND THE NICE THING IS,
MOST OF THEM WANT TO DO IT.

09:04.615 --> 09:07.277
THEY'RE EXCITED ABOUT BEING
ON THE CUTTING EDGE. (slurps)

09:07.277 --> 09:10.651
UNTIL THEY CODE ON THE TABLE
IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE WORLD.
IN WHICH CASE,
I'D STOP TWEETING.

09:10.651 --> 09:13.053
IN THE MEANTIME, RESIDENTS
FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY

09:13.053 --> 09:15.055
GET TO SEE A SURGEON'S
DECISION-MAKING PROCESS.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.057
THEY GET
TO ASK QUESTIONS LIVE.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.259
IT'S A GREAT TEACHING TOOL.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.862
NO, IT'S LAWYER BAIT.
SHUT IT DOWN, DR. BAILEY.

09:21.862 --> 09:24.334
SIR, IF YOU UNDERSTOOD IT,
YOU'D BE ON BOARD.

09:24.334 --> 09:26.797
I UNDERSTAND IT FINE.
UH-HUH.

09:26.797 --> 09:29.940
I UNDERSTAND IT, DR. BAILEY.
IF YOU SAY SO.

09:29.940 --> 09:33.143
I DO SAY SO.

09:33.143 --> 09:35.806
DON'T GIVE ME BAILEY EYES.

09:35.806 --> 09:38.348
(sighs)

09:40.180 --> 09:43.854
I'LL... LOOK INTO
THIS TWEETER THING.

09:43.854 --> 09:45.315
BUT NO PROMISES.

09:45.315 --> 09:47.918
UH, DOES THIS MEAN I GET
TO TWEET IN THE MEANTIME?

09:47.918 --> 09:50.921
NO, IT MEANS GIVE ME A CHANCE
TO LOOK INTO IT.

09:50.921 --> 09:52.362
(laughs)

09:52.362 --> 09:54.364
HI. WHAT'S GOING ON?
HOW'S YOUR DAY GOING SO FAR?

09:54.364 --> 09:56.366
GOOD. I'VE GOT
A CABG LATER THIS MORNING

09:56.366 --> 09:58.368
WITH AVERY AND YANG,
WHO HAVE OFFICIALLY ENTERED

09:58.368 --> 10:01.371
INTO THE RABID DOG STAGE
IN THE RACE FOR CHIEF RESIDENT,

10:01.371 --> 10:03.373
WHICH COULD BE A GOOD THING

10:03.373 --> 10:05.636
OR IT COULD BE A-A BAD THING,
WHICH I--

10:05.636 --> 10:08.979
YOU REALLY AREN'T INTERESTED
IN MY DAY AT ALL, ARE YOU?
I MIGHT BE HAVING
MARK SLOAN'S BABY.

10:08.979 --> 10:11.341
OH, GOOD LORD.
HE GOT TO YOU, TOO?
(elevator bell dings)

10:11.341 --> 10:13.283
CALLIE IS PREGNANT
WITH MARK'S KID.

10:13.283 --> 10:15.145
IT'S WHILE WE WERE,
YOU KNOW...

10:15.145 --> 10:17.147
I LOVE CALLIE,
AND MARK...

10:17.147 --> 10:19.750
YOU KNOW, IS HUMAN
AND CLEARLY HAS GOOD GENES

10:19.750 --> 10:22.723
BECAUSE HE'S BOTH PRETTY
AND SMART.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.195
AND I WANT TO HAVE A KID,
BUT WITH CALLIE.

10:25.195 --> 10:28.198
I'M NOT SURE THAT I WANT
TO HAVE CALLIE'S KID WITH MARK.

10:28.198 --> 10:30.701
AND SO JUST--CAN YOU
SAY SOMETHING TO ME

10:30.701 --> 10:33.403
THAT WILL MAKE ME WANT TO HAVE
CALLIE'S KID WITH MARK?
UM...

10:33.403 --> 10:36.406
(pager beeps)
I GOTTA GO.

10:36.406 --> 10:37.868
(sighs)

10:37.868 --> 10:40.040
WHAT HAPPENED?

10:40.040 --> 10:42.172
I MIGHT BE MISCARRYING.
YOU'RE NOT MISCARRYING.

10:42.172 --> 10:44.074
WELL, THEN IT'S AN ECTOPIC.

10:44.074 --> 10:46.917
COULD IT BE A BLIGHTED OVUM?
IT'S NOT A MOLAR PREGNANCY,
IS IT?

10:46.917 --> 10:49.680
WOW. WE GOT A LOT OF DOCTORS
IN THE ROOM.

10:49.680 --> 10:52.322
(Mark) WHO THE HELL ARE YOU,
AND WHAT ARE YOUR CREDENTIALS?

10:52.322 --> 10:54.324
LUCY FIELDS, HARVARD M.D.,
DUKE OB-GYN RESIDENT,

10:54.324 --> 10:56.186
AND NOW
MATERNAL-FETAL MEDICINE FELLOW

10:56.186 --> 10:58.428
AT SEATTLE GRACE MERCY WEST.
DAMN GOOD AT MY JOB.

10:58.428 --> 11:00.991
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?
WE'RE, UH, WE'RE RELATED
TO THE...

11:00.991 --> 11:03.663
OH, UH, THAT'S, A-A...

11:03.663 --> 11:05.265
IT'S A SITUATION.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.197
LESBIAN LOVER,
BABY DADDY.

11:07.197 --> 11:09.069
AH, AND EVERYBODY'S
A LITTLE WIGGED OUT.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.801
(elevator bell dings)

11:10.801 --> 11:12.342
OKAY. SO...

11:13.944 --> 11:16.076
(chuckles)

11:16.076 --> 11:18.949
THERE'S YOUR BABY.

11:20.450 --> 11:23.213
THERE IS THE YOLK SAC.

11:23.213 --> 11:25.455
LOOKS GOOD.
YOU'RE GOOD.

11:25.455 --> 11:28.058
I'M BLEEDING. I--
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON.

11:28.058 --> 11:30.060
HAPPENS IN AROUND 30%
OF ALL PREGNANCIES.

11:30.060 --> 11:33.964
IT'S PROBABLY FINE.
BUT I-I DON'T SEE A HEARTBEAT.
WHERE'S--WHERE IS THE HEARTBEAT?

11:33.964 --> 11:36.696
OH, WELL, IT'S PROBABLY
TOO EARLY FOR THAT.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.770
I'LL DO BLOOD WORK, BUT I'M
PRETTY SURE EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

11:39.770 --> 11:41.772
JUST TAKE IT EASY
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS,

11:41.772 --> 11:44.374
DRINK A LOT OF WATER,
NO TAMPONS, NO INTERCOURSE.
SING IT.

11:44.374 --> 11:47.237
UH, CALL ME IF THE BLEEDING
GETS WORSE OR IF THERE'S PAIN.

11:47.237 --> 11:49.709
OTHERWISE,
GO LIVE YOUR LIFE,

11:49.709 --> 11:51.982
ALL OF YOU,
WHILE YOU STILL CAN.

11:56.046 --> 11:58.448
MARTHA ELKIN, 75,
MULTI-VESSEL CORONARY DISEASE

11:58.448 --> 12:00.120
CONFIRMED BY AN ANGIOGRAPHY.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.422
HERE THIS MORNING
FOR AN OFF-PUMP CABG.

12:02.422 --> 12:05.395
THAT'S JUST DOCTOR SPEAK
FOR A QUADRUPLE BYPASS.

12:05.395 --> 12:06.997
OH, THANK YOU.

12:06.997 --> 12:08.999
PRE-OP LABS
AND HER X-RAYS WERE NORMAL.

12:08.999 --> 12:11.131
OKAY. YOU'RE READY
TO ROLL, MARTHA.

12:11.131 --> 12:13.133
MY HUSBAND WENT DOWN
FOR SOME COFFEE.

12:13.133 --> 12:16.907
HE WANTED TO KNOW HOW LONG I'D
BE ASLEEP AFTER THE PROCEDURE.

12:16.907 --> 12:18.939
(Jackson) WELL, MARTHA,
IT'S HARD TO TELL.

12:18.939 --> 12:21.011
EVERY PATIENT
REACTS DIFFERENTLY.

12:21.011 --> 12:24.414
UH, BUT WE'LL KEEP HIM POSTED.
MOST PATIENTS WAKE
WITHIN 90 MINUTES.

12:24.414 --> 12:27.818
OH, THAT'S HELPFUL, DEAR.
HE'LL BE GLAD TO KNOW THAT.

12:27.818 --> 12:30.050
WE--WE'RE BOTH SO NERVOUS.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.052
WELL, SOME ANXIETY
IS COMPLETELY NORMAL.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.184
BUT LET ME...

12:34.184 --> 12:36.756
REASSURE YOU.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.359
DR. ALTMAN IS
AN INCREDIBLY TALENTED SURGEON.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.892
YOU'RE IN THE VERY BEST
OF HANDS.

12:41.892 --> 12:43.964
UM, MARTHA, I'D LIKE TO...
(bed rail latch clicks)

12:43.964 --> 12:45.896
GIVE YOU
MY CELLULAR TELEPHONE NUMBER.

12:45.896 --> 12:48.338
NOW YOU OR YOUR HUSBAND,
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS,

12:48.338 --> 12:50.841
IF HE GETS A LITTLE WORRIED
OR WANTS AN UPDATE,

12:50.841 --> 12:53.043
THEN HE CAN CALL THIS NUMBER.

12:53.043 --> 12:55.045
I'LL EVEN MAKE SURE
TO HAVE A NURSE ANSWER

12:55.045 --> 12:57.447
IF WE'RE IN THE O.R.
OH, YOU'RE WONDERFUL.

12:57.447 --> 12:59.309
I MEAN, YOU ALL ARE.

12:59.309 --> 13:03.213
THIS IS THE FINEST PATIENT CARE
THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN.

13:03.213 --> 13:05.886
I FEEL LIKE A-A V.I.P.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.988
WELL, IT'S JUST
WHAT WE DO.
(tears paper)

13:07.988 --> 13:11.061
(paper rustles, pen clicks)

13:11.061 --> 13:12.923
(indistinct conversations)

13:12.923 --> 13:15.896
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

13:15.896 --> 13:18.528
HEY. HOW LONG
ARE YOU GONNA BE IN THERE?

13:18.528 --> 13:21.131
OH, I'VE GOTTA PUT ON
A LOCALIZING FRAME.

13:21.131 --> 13:22.572
AT LEAST AN HOUR.

13:22.572 --> 13:24.935
AN HOUR?
YEAH, GIVE OR TAKE.

13:24.935 --> 13:27.938
DR. SHEPHERD WANTS ME TO BE
AS THOROUGH AS POSSIBLE.

13:27.938 --> 13:30.340
NO! I'M NOT DOING THIS
WITHOUT MY WIFE.

13:30.340 --> 13:33.083
SIR.
NO!

13:33.083 --> 13:36.186
(Alex) MR. COBB,
YOUR WIFE IS RIGHT HERE.

13:36.186 --> 13:39.089
THAT'S NOT MY WIFE.
MRS. COBB.
LOOK, IT'S YOUR WIFE.

13:39.089 --> 13:40.550
THAT'S NOT VICTORIA.

13:40.550 --> 13:42.552
DANIEL, DANIEL, DANIEL.

13:42.552 --> 13:45.325
DANIEL, IT'S ME.
IT'S ALLISON.
YOU'RE NOT VICTORIA.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.328
IT'S ALLISON.
YOU'RE--YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE.
YOU'RE NOT VICTORIA.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.560
IT'S ALLISON.
I WANT VICTORIA.
I WANT MY WIFE.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.963
IT'S ALLISON.
GET AWAY FROM ME!

13:54.504 --> 13:57.037
SIR, WHO IS YOUR WIFE?

13:57.037 --> 13:59.039
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.170
SIR?

14:00.170 --> 14:02.112
I TOLD YOU.
IT'S VICTORIA.

14:02.112 --> 14:03.573
I WANT VICTORIA.

14:03.573 --> 14:05.245
IS SHE HERE?

14:05.245 --> 14:08.418
(pants) NO.

14:08.418 --> 14:10.550
DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS?

14:10.550 --> 14:12.983
I DON'T--

14:12.983 --> 14:16.126
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW.
OKAY, OKAY. I...

14:16.126 --> 14:18.488
WELL, I'M GONNA GO FIND
VICTORIA FOR YOU, OKAY?

14:18.488 --> 14:20.490
I'M GONNA GO LOOK FOR HER.

14:20.490 --> 14:22.532
I'M GONNA FIND HER
AND BRING HER TO YOU.

14:22.532 --> 14:24.564
YOU SIT TIGHT.
I'LL FIND VICTORIA.
(pats leg)

14:24.564 --> 14:27.998
OKAY. OKAY. OKAY.

14:27.998 --> 14:30.040
(lowered voice) DO YOU KNOW
WHO VICTORIA IS?

14:32.142 --> 14:35.075
VICTORIA IS THE WOMAN
HE LOVES.

14:48.558 --> 14:51.321
(Allison) THEY MET
AT THE HOME LAST YEAR.

14:51.321 --> 14:54.564
MM-HMM.
ONE DAY HE ASKED ME
TO WHEEL HER TOWARDS HIM.

14:54.564 --> 14:56.896
AND THAT WAS IT.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.569
I WATCHED HIM
FALL IN LOVE WITH HER.

14:59.569 --> 15:02.202
WELL, BEN AND I WATCHED.

15:02.202 --> 15:05.335
YOU'RE VICTORIA'S HUSBAND?

15:05.335 --> 15:08.908
UNTIL SHE LEAVES ME.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.311
OH, SHE'S NOT GONNA
LEAVE YOU, BEN.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.583
WE'LL SEE.

15:13.583 --> 15:17.347
VICTORIA WAS DIAGNOSED
WITH VASCULAR DEMENTIA.

15:17.347 --> 15:20.550
IT'S NOT ALZHEIMER'S,
BUT IT MIGHT AS WELL BE.

15:20.550 --> 15:22.492
SHE'S LIKE DANIEL.

15:22.492 --> 15:26.156
WHEN SHE'S LUCID,
SHE KNOWS I'M HER HUSBAND.

15:26.156 --> 15:28.328
WHEN SHE'S NOT...

15:28.328 --> 15:31.331
I GO FROM BEING HER HUSBAND
TO, UH,

15:31.331 --> 15:34.104
SOMEBODY THAT GETS TO HEAR
ABOUT DANIEL ALL THE TIME.

15:34.104 --> 15:36.406
DANIEL CAN STILL BE
IN THE TRIAL, CAN'T HE?

15:36.406 --> 15:38.408
THIS DOESN'T MEAN
HE CAN'T DO IT?

15:38.408 --> 15:40.410
NO, HE CAN STILL DO IT.

15:40.410 --> 15:42.442
THE RULE FOR THE STUDY IS,
UH, WE NEED HIS CONSENT.

15:42.442 --> 15:45.015
ONCE WE HAVE IT, IT'S OKAY
IF HE'S NOT ALWAYS LUCID.

15:45.015 --> 15:47.647
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY MORE OPENINGS, DO YOU?

15:47.647 --> 15:50.450
UNFORTUNATELY, THE TRIAL IS
ONLY FOR ALZHEIMER'S DEMENTIA.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.682
THERE'S NO CHANCE?

15:52.682 --> 15:54.454
I'M SORRY.

15:56.426 --> 15:59.189
(Daniel and Allison laugh)

16:04.334 --> 16:08.168
THIS IS SERIOUSLY JACKED UP.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.570
(cell phone chimes)
MAYO CLINIC
SAYS "GOOD LUCK."

16:10.570 --> 16:14.104
(chime)
CLEVELAND CLINIC SENT YOU
A WHOLE BUNCH OF SMILEY FACES.

16:14.104 --> 16:16.446
(chime)
AND THERE'S A RESIDENT
FROM SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA,

16:16.446 --> 16:18.448
JOINING US FOR THE FIRST TIME.
YAY, SYDNEY.

16:18.448 --> 16:20.510
(chime)
TURN IT OFF, GREY.
CHIEF'S ORDERS.

16:20.510 --> 16:23.213
OH, BUT THIS IS MR. WINDSOR'S
THIRD OPERATION.

16:23.213 --> 16:26.116
EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW
HOW IT COMES OUT.
OKAY, UNTIL I GET THE OKAY
FROM THE CHIEF,

16:26.116 --> 16:28.988
WE'RE NOT EVEN GONNA TWEET
THE TIME OF DAY.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.721
I MEAN, IT'S--IT'S NOT LIKE
THE CHIEF EVEN READS TWEETS.

16:31.721 --> 16:35.195
IT'S NOT LIKE HE'LL KNOW.
DROP IT, KEPNER.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.527
I UNDERSTAND.
HE'S THE BOSS.

16:37.527 --> 16:40.730
A-AND I'M SURE THAT
HE'S GOT HIS REASONS.

16:40.730 --> 16:45.105
BUT YOU'VE ALSO GOT
3,000 RESIDENTS OUT THERE

16:45.105 --> 16:47.637
WHO HAVE BEEN BY YOUR SIDE
THIS WHOLE TIME,

16:47.637 --> 16:50.740
THROUGH A COUPLE OF--
OF VERY DIFFICULT,

16:50.740 --> 16:54.244
TIME-CONSUMING,
LIFE-THREATENING OPERATIONS.

16:54.244 --> 16:57.547
AND NOW TO TELL THEM FORGET IT,
JUST LIKE THAT?

16:57.547 --> 16:59.649
IT--IT--IT--IT'S LIKE...

16:59.649 --> 17:02.152
IT'S LIKE TURNING OFF
THE TV

17:02.152 --> 17:05.195
WHEN CLARICE IS KNOCKING
ON THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE.

17:05.195 --> 17:07.026
IT--IT'S SILENCING THE LAMBS,

17:07.026 --> 17:10.160
AND--AND--AND THE LAMBS
WANT TO SCREAM, DR. BAILEY.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.632
THE LAMBS...
(whispers) WANT TO SCREAM.

17:12.632 --> 17:15.635
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

17:18.338 --> 17:20.740
THE MAN WOULD NEVER KNOW.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.213
NO. NO, THE MAN WOULD NOT.

17:28.118 --> 17:30.120
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

17:30.120 --> 17:32.152
(people speaking indistinctly)

17:32.152 --> 17:33.723
(Derek clears throat)

17:33.723 --> 17:35.725
WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S REALLY FUN

17:35.725 --> 17:37.457
AND NOT AT ALL DEPRESSING?

17:37.457 --> 17:39.489
ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH.

17:39.489 --> 17:42.192
CALLIE'S HAVING MY BABY.

17:42.192 --> 17:43.593
WHAT?

17:43.593 --> 17:45.064
RIGHT?

17:45.064 --> 17:47.367
BEST NEWS OF MY LIFE.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.769
AT LEAST IT WOULD BE,
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT

17:49.769 --> 17:51.501
THAT LEXIE WANTS A BABY

17:51.501 --> 17:53.543
ABOUT AS MUCH
AS SHE WANTS A ROOT CANAL.

17:53.543 --> 17:56.546
I-I GUESS I COULD TELL HER
I'M THE BABY'S UNCLE.

17:56.546 --> 17:59.249
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE
THE COOL UNCLE.

17:59.249 --> 18:01.711
THE COOL UNCLE'S ONLY COOL
TILL THE KID'S, LIKE, 9,

18:01.711 --> 18:04.454
AND THEN THE COOL UNCLE'S
JUST CREEPY.

18:04.454 --> 18:06.616
(chuckles)
I'M THE DAD.

18:06.616 --> 18:08.488
I WANT THIS...

18:08.488 --> 18:11.090
AND I WANT LEXIE.

18:12.522 --> 18:14.594
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT--WHAT DO I DO?

18:14.594 --> 18:17.327
YOU'RE THE MAN WITH THE ANSWERS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

18:17.327 --> 18:20.600
HOW COULD MEREDITH AND I TRY FOR
MONTHS AND NOT HAVE ANY LUCK,

18:20.600 --> 18:23.273
AND YOU LOOK AT SOMEBODY,
AND A BABY APPEARS?

18:23.273 --> 18:27.407
SLOANS ARE UNUSUALLY FERTILE.
YOU'RE A CLASSIC EXAMPLE
OF FAILING UP.

18:27.407 --> 18:31.411
NOT EXACTLY THE ADVICE
I WAS LOOKING FOR.
WELL, YOU GOT IT. CHEERS.

18:31.411 --> 18:34.584
(pager beeps)

18:37.447 --> 18:39.149
SHE OKAY?
(Lucy) YEP.

18:39.149 --> 18:40.420
MAYBE.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.622
I SAID, "YEP."
YEP IS NOT MAYBE. IT'S YEP.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.654
SHE PAGED US.
I PAGED YOU.

18:44.654 --> 18:46.656
CALLIE HASN'T LEFT
THE EXAM ROOM

18:46.656 --> 18:49.629
SINCE YOU WERE LAST HERE
TWO HOURS AGO.
WELL, WHAT IF IT IS
A MOLAR PREGNANCY

18:49.629 --> 18:52.262

IT ISN'T DONE FOR TRAUMA

29:04.743 --> 29:07.146
DOESN'T MEAN--
I KNOW. I--
BUT EVEN IF WE WANTED TO,

29:07.146 --> 29:09.148
WE DON'T HAVE THE EQUIPMENT
TO EXTRACT CELLS.

29:09.148 --> 29:11.250

SHE'S WIGGED OUT, OKAY?

29:43.182 --> 29:45.955
SHE WON'T SAY ANYTHING.
I THINK IT'S MY FAULT.
WELL, WHAT DID YOU DO?

29:45.955 --> 29:47.957
WE WERE JUST BOTH BUSTING
EACH OTHER'S BALLS.

29:47.957 --> 29:49.889
WE'RE BOTH ON THE SAME SURGERY,

29:49.889 --> 29:52.892
