<i>It's Movieland's</i>
<i>biggest night--</i>

00:06.441 --> 00:09.093
<i>a night filled</i>
<i>with unimaginable surprises.</i>

00:09.236 --> 00:12.409
<i>Some will go home winners,</i>
<i>and some will go home losers.</i>

00:12.530 --> 00:13.939
<i>But one thing's for sure.</i>

00:14.062 --> 00:16.379
<i>It's the glitziest,</i>
<i>most glamorous evening</i>

00:16.477 --> 00:17.694
<i>of the year.</i>

00:18.645 --> 00:22.720
Aw. Moths ate my Oscar carpet.

00:22.848 --> 00:23.852
Oh, no.

00:23.947 --> 00:25.462
Where will Brad Pitt walk?

00:25.569 --> 00:27.701
Come on, Mike.
It's exciting.

00:27.816 --> 00:30.371
The Oscars. I like it.

00:30.481 --> 00:31.920
It's a nice bit of escapism.

00:32.014 --> 00:33.724
Yeah, I'm all on board
with escaping.

00:33.828 --> 00:35.811
Well, you're not allowed to.
You're watching it.

00:35.922 --> 00:37.888
It's like the Super Bowl
of Hollywood.

00:38.025 --> 00:39.326
What do you know
about Hollywood?

00:39.431 --> 00:41.204
Hey, I know plenty
about Hollywood.

00:41.294 --> 00:43.656
I do the "People"
crossword puzzle every week.

00:43.781 --> 00:45.561
And 5 across is shut up.

00:45.726 --> 00:48.535
Well, just five more days,
and I'm off to the Windy City.

00:48.678 --> 00:49.918
What are you talking about?

00:50.047 --> 00:51.099
Oh, the Chicago trip.

00:51.217 --> 00:52.706
Every year,
the fifth grade class

00:52.805 --> 00:54.126
gets to take a trip,
and this year

00:54.176 --> 00:55.748
we're going to Chicago
for three days.

00:55.855 --> 00:57.938
They've been having meetings
about it all year.

00:58.106 --> 01:01.253
You... know
I'm in fifth grade, right?

01:01.927 --> 01:04.720
We get to stay in a hotel,
go to museums,

01:04.845 --> 01:06.746
have meals <i>in</i> restaurants.

01:06.843 --> 01:10.479
- Wow. Exciting. That sounds like
quite a trip. - I know, right?

01:10.597 --> 01:11.837
I'm finally gonna see the place

01:11.850 --> 01:14.014
"The Tastes Of Chicago" catalog
is from.

01:17.543 --> 01:18.987
Yeah. He's not goin'.

01:19.992 --> 01:21.508
- What?
- Are you kidding me?

01:21.627 --> 01:24.806
This is Brick we're talking
about. Brick alone in Chicago?

01:24.919 --> 01:27.008
He won't be alone.
He'll be with 30 other kids.

01:27.122 --> 01:30.187
Yeah, for about five seconds
until he wanders onto a bus

01:30.325 --> 01:33.818
or an El train or a boat
or a beam 30 stories

01:33.926 --> 01:36.417
over the city.
Have you not seen "Mr. Magoo"?

01:39.359 --> 01:41.419
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:41.532 --> 01:43.873
Oh, my God.
Did you see how weird that was?

01:44.017 --> 01:46.785
That was so weird.
Wasn't it weird?

01:46.895 --> 01:48.201
So weird.

01:48.507 --> 01:50.097
Okay, I have to tell you
something,

01:50.234 --> 01:52.035
but you have to promise
you won't tell anyone.

01:52.387 --> 01:54.122
Did I tell anyone
when you swallowed a fly?

01:54.223 --> 01:56.625
Okay. Well, when Darrin took me
to the Valentine's Day dance,

01:56.734 --> 01:59.640
and we were cleaning up,
our eyes met over the trash can,

01:59.801 --> 02:01.950
- and he kissed me.
- Aah!

02:02.090 --> 02:04.469
Oh, my God! So are--
are you guys like a thing now?

02:04.607 --> 02:06.435
I don't know. We didn't
really get a chance to talk.

02:06.558 --> 02:07.747
Maybe it was just
the mirror ball.

02:07.856 --> 02:10.794
Whenever there are mirror balls,
people do <i>crazy</i> things.

02:10.920 --> 02:12.200
But what if he really likes me

02:12.316 --> 02:13.721
but he doesn't know
that I like him,

02:13.850 --> 02:16.356
- and that's why he's being so weird?
- That's totally it.

02:16.473 --> 02:17.599
But what if he doesn't
really like me,

02:17.691 --> 02:18.993
and he just got caught up
in the whole romance

02:19.099 --> 02:20.671
of Valentine's Day
and doesn't really know how

02:20.791 --> 02:21.996
to tell me he doesn't like me?

02:22.107 --> 02:23.607
- Well, that makes sense, too.
- Well, which one is it?

02:23.721 --> 02:24.824
- Which one do you think it is?
- What do you think?

02:24.935 --> 02:27.335
- What do <i>you</i> think?
- Oh, my God. I think I really like him.

02:27.479 --> 02:29.030
Unless he doesn't like me back.

02:29.463 --> 02:32.283
Thanks, Carly. You always
give the best advice!

02:35.103 --> 02:36.956
<i>Okay,</i>
<i>so I was pretty darn nervous</i>

02:37.072 --> 02:38.541
<i>about Brick going to Chicago,</i>

02:38.678 --> 02:40.678
<i>but I figured once I heard</i>
<i>the details of the trip,</i>

02:40.732 --> 02:42.003
<i>I would feel better.</i>

02:42.187 --> 02:45.085
<i>I was wrong--
very, very wrong.</i>

02:45.363 --> 02:47.098
Now as far as the hotel goes,

02:47.206 --> 02:48.777
we won't have an adult
in each room,

02:48.904 --> 02:51.890
but the kids will be trusted
to monitor themselves.

02:52.011 --> 02:52.809
Oh, God.

02:52.935 --> 02:55.020
They'll have exactly 26 minutes

02:55.130 --> 02:56.961
to wander
around the Observation Deck

02:57.059 --> 02:59.113
on the 103 floor.

02:59.223 --> 03:00.412
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

03:00.521 --> 03:02.202
And then it's off
to Gino's East,

03:02.316 --> 03:05.249
where each child will make
their own deep dish pizza

03:05.387 --> 03:07.680
in an 800-degree oven.

03:07.788 --> 03:08.972
What are you doing to me?

03:09.100 --> 03:12.376
And that brings us to 8:25
and the end of my presentation,

03:12.484 --> 03:16.816
right on time as... always.
Thank you.

03:17.028 --> 03:20.435
Okay, uh, very informative,
Mr. Walker.

03:20.560 --> 03:22.967
Now everyone who's interested
in chaperoning,

03:23.093 --> 03:25.975
please put their name
in this bowl.

03:26.084 --> 03:28.117
Remember to fold
your paper squares twice,

03:28.228 --> 03:30.116
once, and once again.

03:30.457 --> 03:31.565
<i>All right, if there was any way</i>

03:31.671 --> 03:33.105
<i>I was letting Brick</i>
<i>go on this trip,</i>

03:33.267 --> 03:34.370
<i>I was gonna</i>
<i>have to do something</i>

03:34.488 --> 03:36.902
<i>that goes against everything</i>
<i>I stand for--</i>

03:37.006 --> 03:38.110
<i>volunteer.</i>

03:38.209 --> 03:40.476
Hi, Connie.
Well, listen, you're in luck.

03:40.593 --> 03:41.676
I've cleared my schedule,

03:41.781 --> 03:43.636
and I'm available
to chaperone the trip,

03:43.742 --> 03:45.804
so Chaperone Frankie
reporting for duty.

03:45.922 --> 03:48.270
Oh, that's wonderful,
Frankie, but actually,

03:48.395 --> 03:50.662
everybody here
wants to chaperone this trip.

03:50.807 --> 03:52.786
This is the crown jewel
of field trips.

03:52.900 --> 03:56.041
Oh. Well, I should really be
one of the chaperones,

03:56.146 --> 03:58.655
'cause I haven't volunteered
for anything all year.

03:58.769 --> 04:00.408
Oh, now do you really think
that's fair

04:00.609 --> 04:02.992
for you to get to go
on the most coveted field trip

04:03.136 --> 04:05.201
after not volunteering
for anything all year?

04:05.304 --> 04:07.694
Look, Brick's kind of special,

04:07.813 --> 04:09.933
and not the kind you slap
a bumper sticker on your car

04:09.979 --> 04:11.911
to brag about, so...

04:12.010 --> 04:14.616
Sorry. We have
a fair way of doing it.

04:14.733 --> 04:16.666
We put all the names
in a big bowl,

04:16.779 --> 04:18.817
and we pick four,
and those are the ones

04:18.950 --> 04:20.149
that get to be the chaperones.

04:20.279 --> 04:21.315
Good luck.

04:26.321 --> 04:27.281
You know, if I were you,

04:27.362 --> 04:28.979
I wouldn't even wanna go
on this trip.

04:29.158 --> 04:32.283
Kids throw up on buses,
and when one goes, they all go.

04:32.403 --> 04:36.530
Okay, here we go.
Fingers crossed, everyone.

04:39.905 --> 04:40.992
"Jenna Bieler."

04:48.075 --> 04:49.404
"Connie McDonald."

04:49.504 --> 04:50.953
Oh, that's me. Oh.

04:55.335 --> 04:56.742
"Julia Laumann."

04:56.845 --> 04:58.370
Whoo!

05:02.014 --> 05:04.361
And finally...

05:07.178 --> 05:08.580
"Scott Ridgeway."

05:09.732 --> 05:11.519
W-wait a minute.
Hold on a second.

05:11.659 --> 05:12.835
A man's name?

05:12.984 --> 05:14.436
How is there a man's name
in there?

05:14.550 --> 05:16.127
I don't see any men here.

05:16.244 --> 05:17.687
He had a previous engagement.

05:17.810 --> 05:20.242
I'm sorry. Something doesn't
smell right here.

05:20.367 --> 05:22.491
I mean, come on. You just
happened to pick your own name?

05:22.601 --> 05:25.665
We're supposed to believe
that was <i>just</i> a coincidence?

05:25.780 --> 05:27.340
This thing is obviously rigged.

05:27.454 --> 05:30.712
I mean, I didn't get picked,
and I put my name in four times.

05:32.000 --> 05:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:48.770 --> 05:52.778
- Hey, Sue.
- Oh. Hey, Darrin.

05:52.938 --> 05:55.543
Didn't see you there.
So--

05:55.654 --> 05:56.487
Oh, my God!

05:56.600 --> 05:58.080
What are you doing
in the senior hall?

05:58.216 --> 05:59.858
No suck-mores allowed
in the senior hall,

06:00.001 --> 06:01.836
unless you're hot,
which you're not.

06:01.938 --> 06:04.983
I'm Axl Heck, and I approved
this message.

06:05.101 --> 06:06.213
Go!

06:08.200 --> 06:10.537
Sorry about that, Darrin.

06:16.734 --> 06:17.882
Hey, Brick.

06:18.322 --> 06:20.149
I've got a big surprise.

06:20.390 --> 06:22.891
This Saturday, I am taking <i>you</i>

06:23.009 --> 06:25.396
to the book fair
in Terre Haute.

06:25.722 --> 06:27.659
But I'm gonna be in Chicago
on Saturday.

06:27.773 --> 06:31.778
Oh, that's <i>this</i> weekend.
Hmm.

06:32.520 --> 06:34.751
What should we do about that?

06:34.865 --> 06:38.681
Once-in-a-lifetime book fair
or stinky old Chicago?

06:38.781 --> 06:40.502
Well, despite
the poor air quality

06:40.609 --> 06:41.918
and aging infrastructure,

06:42.170 --> 06:43.970
I think it'd still
rather go to Chicago.

06:44.073 --> 06:45.990
Did I tell you about
all the candy I'm gonna buy you?

06:46.099 --> 06:48.714
Oh, in Chicago, we're going
to an old-time candy store.

06:48.828 --> 06:51.327
You know, there's a lot
of bad things about Chicago.

06:51.488 --> 06:53.966
It's cold. There's crime.

06:54.108 --> 06:55.188
The Cubs.

06:55.296 --> 06:56.704
Hey, Brickster.

06:56.824 --> 06:58.237
You pumped
for that Chicago trip?

06:58.383 --> 07:00.544
Dottie's super stoked.
Gonna be the trip of a lifetime.

07:00.632 --> 07:02.212
Uh, I don't think it is, Sean.

07:02.325 --> 07:04.151
There's a lot of other
fun trips coming up.

07:04.328 --> 07:05.031
There's a trip

07:05.124 --> 07:06.609
to the waste recycling plant
in April,

07:06.728 --> 07:09.137
so... yeah.

07:09.927 --> 07:11.744
Why don't you go practice?

07:13.734 --> 07:16.037
Look, Brick, here's the thing.

07:16.155 --> 07:17.659
If I can't be a chaperone,

07:17.789 --> 07:20.016
I just don't feel comfortable
letting you go.

07:20.147 --> 07:22.614
Look, mom,
I understand you're nervous.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.089
But I read books,

07:24.191 --> 07:25.910
and in every one,
the parents are always nervous

07:26.014 --> 07:28.952
about the hero before he goes
off on his great adventure.

07:29.069 --> 07:31.290
But he always goes,
and he's scared,

07:31.435 --> 07:34.551
but he faces the challenge,
and ultimately triumphs.

07:34.656 --> 07:38.159
Well, I watch TV,
and in all the crime shows,

07:38.277 --> 07:40.164
- little kids die.
- Fine.

07:40.376 --> 07:42.621
I guess I'll just be that kid
who didn't get to go

07:42.796 --> 07:44.892
because his mom
was too worried about him.

07:45.067 --> 07:46.212
That'll be fun.

07:46.344 --> 07:48.763
All right, fine.
You can go.

07:48.879 --> 07:51.185
Yes! I'm finally gonna be
like everyone else.

07:51.312 --> 07:52.663
Everyone else.

07:52.785 --> 07:54.008
Whoop!

07:56.735 --> 07:58.582
♪ You run today ♪

08:05.100 --> 08:06.366
Ha ha!

08:06.472 --> 08:08.705
- Oh! Jeez. What the...
- Sorry.

08:08.833 --> 08:11.120
I forgot you guys
were rehearsing today.

08:11.367 --> 08:14.116
- Don't mind me.
- What are you wearing?

08:14.239 --> 08:15.439
Why are you dressed like that?

08:15.563 --> 08:18.115
Oh! I don't know.

08:18.477 --> 08:20.425
Ah! I was just
gonna get the rake.

08:20.628 --> 08:22.045
I was just gonna do some...

08:22.521 --> 08:23.622
raking.

08:23.730 --> 08:26.311
Oh!
There's the turpentine.

08:31.533 --> 08:33.318
Oh! These high heels
sure do come in handy.

08:33.914 --> 08:37.393
Well... you guys can
keep playing. I'll just watch.

08:37.491 --> 08:39.094
Ew! No.

08:39.221 --> 08:40.826
Why not? I mean...

08:40.929 --> 08:42.890
we don't get a lot of practice
in front of people.

08:42.962 --> 08:45.301
Sue is not people!
Now get out!

08:45.658 --> 08:47.528
But, Axl, I--

08:48.417 --> 08:49.224
Axl, you--

08:49.323 --> 08:52.473
Why are you being so-- aah!

09:00.852 --> 09:02.990
<i>So Brick was on his way</i>
<i>to Chicago,</i>

09:03.197 --> 09:05.267
<i>and I had made my peace</i>
<i>with it.</i>

09:05.410 --> 09:09.579
Okay. So you don't have
any books on you? None at all?

09:09.730 --> 09:10.698
No.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.002
Eyes on your surroundings
at all times.

09:13.105 --> 09:15.074
No reading, not even street signs.

09:15.207 --> 09:16.768
And I really shouldn't
have to say this,

09:16.878 --> 09:18.779
but please don't put
anything in your mouth

09:18.920 --> 09:21.084
that isn't food.
No exceptions.

09:21.184 --> 09:22.717
Mom, I'll be fine.

09:24.957 --> 09:26.293
Oh, wait.

09:43.437 --> 09:44.252
Hi.

09:44.353 --> 09:45.313
Frankie Heck.
We met at--

09:45.378 --> 09:46.634
Yeah, I know who you are.

09:46.748 --> 09:48.538
We have all of our chaperones.

09:48.649 --> 09:50.092
Mrs. Heck.

09:50.311 --> 09:53.274
My parent contract
clearly stated

09:53.393 --> 09:55.765
that once you have said good-bye
to your child,

09:55.894 --> 09:59.995
you have 23 seconds
to depart the premises.

10:00.126 --> 10:03.326
Got it. I-I just wanted
to see if he had a buddy yet.

10:03.446 --> 10:05.166
If you could pair him
with someone responsible--

10:05.290 --> 10:06.637
maybe a girl.

10:07.001 --> 10:08.111
We're good here.

10:09.327 --> 10:10.401
Let's move it out!

10:10.493 --> 10:12.583
Also, I packed
all orange clothes

10:12.699 --> 10:14.526
so he'll be easy to spot.
He wanders.

10:14.645 --> 10:16.191
And if someone could check when
he comes out of the bathroom,

10:16.294 --> 10:18.124
I can't 100% guarantee that he'll zip up.

10:18.217 --> 10:20.248
And if those priceless art
like in a museum or something,

10:20.367 --> 10:21.728
be prepared to meet
the guards now,

10:21.816 --> 10:23.387
because he will touch it.

10:23.493 --> 10:24.862
Walk faster.

10:25.053 --> 10:29.895
Okay! Here we go, people.
We're 34 seconds late.

10:34.635 --> 10:37.775
<i>So just when Sue had decided</i>
<i>it was just one amazing kiss</i>

10:37.899 --> 10:40.562
<i>over a garbage can, and that's</i>
<i>all it would ever be...</i>

10:44.783 --> 10:45.832
Hey.

10:46.241 --> 10:47.669
I wrote a song.

10:49.067 --> 10:51.726
This song is called
"Betsy-- Not Her Real Name."

10:53.282 --> 10:58.170
♪ Sometimes it's
easier to sing your feelings ♪

10:58.278 --> 11:02.191
♪ than to say them
to her face ♪

11:02.464 --> 11:05.506

11:32.830 --> 11:34.908
Oh, my God.
I wish I was deaf.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.560
- That sucked.
- That's...

11:36.948 --> 11:39.685
Even Sue thinks it sucked.
Look, she's crying.

11:51.288 --> 11:53.425
<i>The next morning,</i>
<i>I'd like to say I felt better,</i>

11:53.550 --> 11:56.085
<i>that the little cheery e-mail</i>
<i>update they sent us parents</i>

11:56.214 --> 11:57.405
<i>had eased my concerns.</i>

11:57.657 --> 11:59.513
<i>I'd</i> like <i>to say that.</i>

12:00.053 --> 12:02.908
"Missing boy plus Chicago"?
What are you doin'?

12:03.035 --> 12:04.960
What, you think
"kidnapped plus Chicago"

12:05.074 --> 12:06.372
is a better search?

12:06.692 --> 12:08.115
Trust me.

12:08.215 --> 12:09.782
If anyone's dumb enough
to kidnap Brick,

12:09.908 --> 12:11.688
after a couple days,
they'll bring him back.

12:11.956 --> 12:14.342
I can't believe you're
making jokes about this.

12:14.462 --> 12:16.572
Look, Brick's growing up.
We raised him right.

12:16.681 --> 12:17.800
Hopefully some of it stuck.

12:17.910 --> 12:18.962
Give him a chance
to impress you.

12:19.062 --> 12:21.585
It'll prove you right.
Worrying doesn't do any good.

12:21.688 --> 12:24.413
That's not true. It shows God
that you're paying attention,

12:24.518 --> 12:25.718
that you're not getting cocky.

12:25.801 --> 12:27.328
Who's the person
that always gets the piano

12:27.461 --> 12:28.614
dropped on their head?

12:28.724 --> 12:31.440
The one whistling,
not the one looking up.

12:31.993 --> 12:32.792
How many people you know

12:32.920 --> 12:34.784
have gotten a piano
dropped on their head?

12:35.252 --> 12:39.090
"Piano plus head plus death."

12:39.685 --> 12:41.754
Will you cut it out?
Get off the computer.

12:41.944 --> 12:43.119
I just can't stop thinking

12:43.230 --> 12:44.906
he's in some kind of danger.

12:45.131 --> 12:49.190
Frankie, listen to me.
He was fun while we had him.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.158
Mike, stop doing that.

12:53.155 --> 12:55.893
<i>The next day, I was actually</i>
<i>feeling a little better.</i>

12:56.010 --> 12:59.051
<i>Mike was right.</i>
<i>There was no point in worrying.</i>

12:59.169 --> 13:01.098
<i>I just needed to take my mind</i>
<i>off Brick,</i>

13:01.209 --> 13:04.019
<i>and there's no better</i>
<i>distraction than Oscar night.</i>

13:04.299 --> 13:06.313
<i>And there was so much</i>
<i>to distract me.</i>

13:06.429 --> 13:08.998
<i>There was the pre-pre-show.</i>
<i>The pre-arrival show,</i>

13:09.136 --> 13:11.168
<i>the pre-red carpet,</i>
<i>the arrivals,</i>

13:11.279 --> 13:13.655
<i>the red carpet, the interviews,</i>
<i>the ring cam,</i>

13:13.778 --> 13:15.467
<i>the bling cam,</i>
<i>the post-red carpet,</i>

13:15.589 --> 13:17.587
<i>and the post-interview wrap-up.</i>

13:20.073 --> 13:21.715
It's starting!

13:22.015 --> 13:23.624
Aah! Yay!

13:23.891 --> 13:24.970
Yeah!

13:25.150 --> 13:28.163
Okay. Come on.
Everybody fill out a ballot.

13:28.330 --> 13:29.872
I haven't seen
any of these movies.

13:30.329 --> 13:32.524
And unless you're having
an affair, neither have you.

13:32.641 --> 13:33.905
Just fill it out.

13:34.510 --> 13:36.998
- Where are you going? - I'm gonna
call some of the guys from the quarry,

13:37.132 --> 13:38.304
see what their picks are.

13:38.423 --> 13:39.508
Really?

13:39.621 --> 13:41.754
No. I'm going to get a beer.

13:49.836 --> 13:50.957
Hi, Darrin.

13:51.075 --> 13:52.072
Hey, Sue.

13:52.358 --> 13:53.512
You look really nice.

13:53.731 --> 13:56.037
Thanks.
It's Oscar night.

13:57.005 --> 14:00.452
Hey. Um... I didn't get a chance
to tell you the other day,

14:00.605 --> 14:04.564
but you are
an amazing singer/songwriter.

14:04.703 --> 14:07.889
Seriously. No, you are
like Jon Bon Jovi.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.362
Hey, what are you doing here?
We practicing tonight?

14:10.638 --> 14:12.073
I just thought I'd drop by.

14:12.221 --> 14:14.399
Oh. Cool.
Let's go to my room.

14:14.512 --> 14:16.738
Or y-you could watch
the Oscars.

14:19.260 --> 14:21.146
Watching the Oscars
could be fun.

14:21.540 --> 14:22.723
Really?

14:23.164 --> 14:24.671
Guess we could goof on 'em.

14:24.774 --> 14:27.819
Hey, Darrin.
Here. Take a ballot.

14:27.929 --> 14:29.058
Thanks.

14:30.272 --> 14:31.832
Why are they called
the Oscars, anyway?

14:31.942 --> 14:33.433
Why not the Normans
or the Felixes?

14:33.593 --> 14:35.973
Or the Darrins.

14:36.169 --> 14:38.658
And why the red carpet?
Why not a blue one?

14:40.364 --> 14:41.863
That's hilarious.

14:43.031 --> 14:45.715
Uh, here. I'll help you
with your ballot.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.443
If somebody's boob doesn't
pop out soon, I'm outta here.

14:48.549 --> 14:49.269
Seriously, Darrin.

14:49.362 --> 14:50.639
This is boring. Let's go.

14:50.733 --> 14:52.122
Oh, come on. I wanna stay.

14:52.232 --> 14:54.627
I really like my choice
for best sound mixing.

14:59.292 --> 15:02.235
Documentary short. Boom.

15:02.405 --> 15:06.251
Aw! I didn't know "Kiko's Bike"
was about Ugandan warlords.

15:06.370 --> 15:09.115
I would never have picked
"Mandel Bread For Nana."

15:09.236 --> 15:11.202
Oh, Darrin!
What are you doin'?

15:15.054 --> 15:16.045
What?

15:16.147 --> 15:17.014
Shove over.

15:17.122 --> 15:19.343
- Just sit there.
- That's my lucky seat.

15:19.477 --> 15:21.157
I picked best costume
in that seat.

15:21.436 --> 15:22.844
Are you...

15:22.958 --> 15:26.008
Oh! Kate Winslet and Bill Paxton
are about to present.

15:26.222 --> 15:28.708
That's Cate Blanchett
and Bill Pullman.

15:29.078 --> 15:31.372
They really should make them
wear name tags.

15:31.760 --> 15:33.641
Maybe you should suggest that

15:33.752 --> 15:35.887
at the next "People" magazine
crossword meeting.

15:35.998 --> 15:37.794
You know you're wrecking this
for me.

15:39.011 --> 15:42.929
Hey, Brick. Brick?

15:43.176 --> 15:46.261
What are doing here?
You're home. What happened?

15:46.370 --> 15:48.010
Well, we got back
to the school,

15:48.131 --> 15:50.218
and everyone was real excited
to see their parents,

15:50.405 --> 15:53.478
and I thought you'd be there,
but you weren't.

15:53.581 --> 15:54.897
All the other parents
were there.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.674
A lot of them had
"Welcome Home" signs,

15:56.786 --> 15:58.068
and I was waiting and waiting,

15:58.177 --> 16:00.588
thinking you'd come,
but you didn't.

16:00.962 --> 16:02.897
So I got a ride home
with Mrs. Donahue,

16:03.016 --> 16:05.562
and she couldn't believe that
you wouldn't have picked me up.

16:05.691 --> 16:06.957
She thought something
must have happened to you,

16:07.075 --> 16:08.856
but... I guess not.

16:08.977 --> 16:11.529
<i>And</i> the Oscar
for worst mother goes to--

16:11.622 --> 16:13.382
No, no, no, no.
That's not right.

16:13.493 --> 16:14.891
I was supposed to pick you up
tomorrow.

16:15.004 --> 16:18.353
It was a 3-day trip--
Friday, Saturday, Su--

16:21.021 --> 16:22.672
I can still buy you candy.

16:22.818 --> 16:24.498
You were worried about <i>me</i>
being irresponsible,

16:24.607 --> 16:26.222
and you didn't even pick me up.

16:26.336 --> 16:27.504
All right,
I think you're stating

16:27.615 --> 16:28.958
what we all already know,

16:29.069 --> 16:31.201
but you're home now.
So come on. Sit down.

16:31.302 --> 16:32.889
I wanna hear
all about your trip.

16:33.122 --> 16:35.741
- Ah, forget it.
- No. Come on, Brick.

16:35.870 --> 16:38.937
I'm sorry.
I wanna hear all about it.

16:39.056 --> 16:40.333
Put in a tape.

16:40.777 --> 16:43.166
I'm gonna go watch basketball
in the garage.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.994
Brr! I'm cold.

16:49.714 --> 16:51.147
Boring!

16:51.256 --> 16:53.858
Your speech is boring!
Play him off. Come on.

16:54.033 --> 16:55.984
Oh, if you tell your kids
to go to sleep,

16:56.109 --> 16:58.595
I'm gonna shoot myself.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.471
<i>I'd like to thank</i>
<i>the Academy...</i>

17:04.099 --> 17:07.617
Aah!

17:13.146 --> 17:15.791
Aah! No!

17:16.261 --> 17:17.325
No way!

17:17.441 --> 17:18.673
Absolutely not!

17:18.785 --> 17:20.545
- Axl, you don't underst--
- Go to your room!

17:20.585 --> 17:22.710
- You can't tell me to--
- Go to your room!

17:25.085 --> 17:27.847
What are you doing?
Are you insane?!

17:27.959 --> 17:29.762
Is this 'cause
you feel sorry for her?

17:29.878 --> 17:31.479
- No. I like her.
- Is this 'cause I peed

17:31.570 --> 17:33.412
in your Mountain Dew bottle
when we were 7?

17:33.520 --> 17:34.463
That was you?

17:34.577 --> 17:36.042
Well... you are not allowed.

17:36.158 --> 17:38.346
You are not allowed
to date my sister. I forbid it!

17:38.455 --> 17:39.441
But I really like her.

17:39.544 --> 17:42.181
Well...
Fine.

17:42.309 --> 17:44.006
I'm gonna date your mom.
Ha ha!

17:44.111 --> 17:45.813
You better get in there,
because she just met a guy

17:45.937 --> 17:47.031
on Christian Mingle.

17:47.158 --> 17:48.736
I'm gonna date your mom,
and then I'm gonna marry her,

17:48.869 --> 17:49.891
and then I'll be your stepdad,

17:50.022 --> 17:52.057
and then I will forbid you
from dating my sister.

17:52.176 --> 17:53.896
- Axl, we--
- Name one thing you see in her!

17:53.976 --> 17:55.309
- One!
- Well, she--

17:55.452 --> 17:57.743
- I don't wanna hear it!
- Ohh!

17:58.139 --> 17:58.773
Ohh!

17:58.886 --> 18:02.312
Dad, there are <i>things</i>
going on in this house

18:02.451 --> 18:05.840
that you need to know about
right now, and mom, too.

18:06.077 --> 18:07.955
Bedroom! Set!

18:13.044 --> 18:15.422
Now grab a bag to barf in
before I tell you this

18:15.548 --> 18:18.283
'cause I have got
some disgusting news.

18:18.391 --> 18:20.067
You ready? All right?

18:20.195 --> 18:24.592
Sue and my ex-friend Darrin
think they like each other.

18:24.727 --> 18:26.561
Yeah. Absorb that.

18:26.938 --> 18:28.270
They're gonna do stuff.

18:28.415 --> 18:30.775
Maybe not yet.
But they're gonna do stuff,

18:30.904 --> 18:33.598
and...
I can't even talk about this.

18:33.719 --> 18:35.113
I'm making myself sick.

18:35.323 --> 18:37.937
Darrin? Really? Huh.

18:38.116 --> 18:39.932
Well, Axl, Sue's getting older,

18:40.048 --> 18:42.008
and you have to expect things
like this to happen.

18:42.082 --> 18:44.740
- They spend a lot of time toge--
- No! <i>No!</i>

18:44.854 --> 18:46.134
Now I know
I've said this before,

18:46.215 --> 18:48.371
but this time I mean it!
Do some parenting!

18:48.453 --> 18:49.734
Make them stop!

18:49.829 --> 18:51.949
Maybe you should worry
a little less about me flushing

18:51.952 --> 18:53.619
and more about who
your daughter's dating.

18:54.147 --> 18:55.192
Hmm?

18:55.299 --> 18:56.703
Brr!

18:58.295 --> 19:02.109
Well... this is interesting.

19:02.244 --> 19:05.331
Hmm. I guess she was bound
to date one of Axl's friends.

19:05.458 --> 19:07.238
Yeah. I don't like it.

19:07.419 --> 19:10.568
He's too old, he's too dumb,
and he's too Darrin.

19:10.670 --> 19:12.698
Well, yes,
he's all those things,

19:12.843 --> 19:15.976
but he's also very sweet
and harmless.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.394
That's what the neighbors
always say about serial killers.

19:18.645 --> 19:20.638
Mike, we've known his family
for years.

19:20.756 --> 19:22.599
They're good people.
He's a nice kid.

19:22.709 --> 19:24.025
Let's not overreact.

19:24.131 --> 19:25.645
I can't believe
you're not worried about this.

19:25.753 --> 19:27.323
He's 18, and he looks 30.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.946
Well, you're the one who said
they're getting older.

19:30.067 --> 19:31.384
They're growing up.

19:31.498 --> 19:33.727
We have to trust
that we've done our job

19:33.848 --> 19:36.154
and that Sue's ready
to make good decisions.

19:36.291 --> 19:38.767
You said you don't worry,
so just don't worry.

19:38.873 --> 19:41.182
Nobody likes being given
their own advice, Frankie.

19:41.386 --> 19:42.888
Well, what are we
supposed to do?

19:42.997 --> 19:44.838
We can't tell her
she can't go out with him.

19:44.965 --> 19:47.389
She already had car dates
with Matt.

19:47.498 --> 19:48.494
- She did?
- Mm.

19:48.605 --> 19:50.307
- Where was I?
- You...

19:50.648 --> 19:52.051
I'm gonna talk to this kid.

19:52.688 --> 19:55.958
Whatever happened to Brad?

19:56.147 --> 19:57.975
I liked it when
she was dating Brad.

20:04.996 --> 20:07.329
So I understand you're
interested in taking out Sue.

20:07.456 --> 20:08.692
Yes, sir.

20:09.911 --> 20:12.251
I just wanna remind you
that I work at a quarry,

20:12.369 --> 20:13.997
and I have access to dynamite.

20:14.160 --> 20:16.973
Yeah, I know.
You have the coolest job.

20:17.700 --> 20:19.892
I think you're missing
what I'm saying here, Darrin.

20:20.070 --> 20:22.090
I'm saying if you're gonna
go out with Sue,

20:22.226 --> 20:25.213
when you're with <i>her,</i>
I want you to picture my face.

20:26.303 --> 20:27.199
No offense, sir,

20:27.327 --> 20:28.763
but that's sort of
a mood killer.

20:28.980 --> 20:31.095
I really like her, sir,
and I will treat her

20:31.206 --> 20:32.222
with the utmost respect,

20:32.350 --> 20:34.640
and I would never do
anything to hurt her.

20:36.272 --> 20:39.919
Ugh. All right.
I guess, fine.

20:40.032 --> 20:41.127
Thanks, Mr. Heck.

20:41.224 --> 20:43.073
I really appreciate
the vote of confidence.

20:43.182 --> 20:44.389
And I'm gonna take you up
on that offer

20:44.495 --> 20:46.092
to come see the quarry.

20:49.387 --> 20:51.720
<i>So another Oscar night</i>
<i>had come and gone.</i>

20:51.844 --> 20:52.973
<i>There were winners...</i>

20:53.070 --> 20:54.110
We're going out
for fro-yo.

20:54.123 --> 20:55.749
We'll be back
in half an hour. Bye!

20:56.874 --> 20:58.493
<i>There were losers...</i>

20:59.406 --> 21:01.215
<i>and there were surprises...</i>

21:01.344 --> 21:03.824
Ooh, and here's a
picture of me at Wrigley Field.

21:03.829 --> 21:06.260
I didn't know you guys
went to Wrigley Field.

21:06.377 --> 21:08.016
Oh, no, just me.
