00:06.607 --> 00:08.676
BARNEY:
This year for Founder's Day,

00:08.709 --> 00:10.344
we're going all out.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.346
I've rented an authentic
Western stallion

00:12.380 --> 00:14.215
to give horsey rides
in the parking lot.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.116
You can thank my connection

00:15.149 --> 00:16.717
at a Canadian meat company
for that one.

00:16.750 --> 00:19.153
This will probably be
his last weekend, so don't

00:19.187 --> 00:20.588
be stingy with the carrots.

00:20.621 --> 00:21.755
Where were you?

00:21.789 --> 00:24.192
I got a ticket
taking Hope to day care.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.559
I haven't been
drinking, Officer.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.195
And if you open up that door,

00:27.228 --> 00:29.463
you'll see why I
was driving so slow.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.236
Oh, no, please don't
write me a ticket.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.671
Look, I have a van,
my fiancée has a moped.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.273
And when I spend the night
at my fiancée's house,

00:39.307 --> 00:40.608
I can't borrow my
mom's car, and...

00:40.641 --> 00:42.276
Look, I swear it's safe.

00:42.310 --> 00:45.079
I get in accidents all the time.

00:45.113 --> 00:46.714
Don't worry.
I figured out a way

00:46.747 --> 00:48.682
to drive Hope
that's even safer.

00:48.716 --> 00:51.385
Does this involve the
text message you sent

00:51.419 --> 00:55.123
asking me to fill a shopping
cart with marshmallows?

00:55.156 --> 00:57.158
We got to buy a new car.

00:57.191 --> 00:59.560
These vintage cash registers
are going

00:59.593 --> 01:01.395
to be a treat for the customers,

01:01.429 --> 01:03.097
but a terrible burden
for all of you.

01:03.131 --> 01:05.266
They only go up to
nine dollars and 99 cents,

01:05.299 --> 01:07.701
and they may be plated in lead,
so whatever you do,

01:07.735 --> 01:09.237
don't lick your fingers
after using them.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.239
I'm talking to you, Frank.

01:14.442 --> 01:15.809
Buy a car, huh?

01:15.843 --> 01:17.211
It's just a big decision.

01:17.245 --> 01:18.479
But maybe you're right.

01:18.512 --> 01:21.149
Maybe I need
to man up and do it.

01:21.182 --> 01:23.284
I'll talk to my parents
about it after work.

01:23.317 --> 01:25.119
Jimmy, you are a
25-year-old man.

01:25.153 --> 01:26.620
I think you're a
little bit past

01:26.654 --> 01:28.489
having to ask your parents'
permission to buy a car.

01:28.522 --> 01:30.558
So you input the price,

01:30.591 --> 01:32.826
you crank the handle,
and the drawer opens.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.128
(bell dings)

01:34.162 --> 01:36.264
Hmm. Must be stuck.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.298
(grunts)

01:39.800 --> 01:41.669
In sticking
with our Founder's Day theme,

01:41.702 --> 01:43.837
I refuse
to accept any modern medicine.

01:43.871 --> 01:48.176
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go read the scripture

01:48.209 --> 01:50.211
until the devil comes out of me.

01:53.214 --> 01:55.316
Look, I'll talk to my parents
about the car thing,

01:55.349 --> 01:58.352
and if they say
it's okay, I'll do it.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.154
No biggie.

02:00.188 --> 02:01.189
(sighs)

02:01.222 --> 02:04.625
Hey, I know what
you're thinking.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.594
"Am I really getting
married to a guy

02:06.627 --> 02:08.496
"who has to ask Mommy
and Daddy's permission

02:08.529 --> 02:09.797
to buy a car?"

02:09.830 --> 02:11.432
That's not very
sexy, is it?

02:11.465 --> 02:15.203
FYI, I haven't talked to
my parents in seven years,

02:15.236 --> 02:18.806
I'm a free-thinker,
and I can do 25 sit-ups...

02:18.839 --> 02:20.308
throughout the course of a day.

02:20.341 --> 02:23.644
I'm just putting
it out there.

02:23.677 --> 02:26.214
* Whoo

02:26.247 --> 02:31.385
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

02:31.419 --> 02:34.255
A new car?

02:34.288 --> 02:36.790
New? Buying a
new car is nuts.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.326
It borders on reckless.

02:38.359 --> 02:42.796
But we need a new car,
and Sabrina said--

02:42.830 --> 02:44.332
Sabrina says. Sabrina says.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.200
Think for yourself, Jimmy.

02:46.234 --> 02:48.402
And for God's sake,
do as we say.

02:48.436 --> 02:50.671
A new car is a complete waste
of money.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.506
They lose three-fourths
of their value

02:52.540 --> 02:54.208
the minute
you drive 'em off the lot.

02:54.242 --> 02:54.908
That can't be true.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.577
Doesn't matter, anyway.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.412
There's no way you guys have
enough money for a new car.

02:58.446 --> 03:00.848
We don't need all the money.
We're gonna take out a loan.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.850
Whoa! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.918
Whoa. We don't take
out loans, Jimmy.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.887
Credit is for chumps.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.291
Credit is why this whole
country is in a deep repression.

03:10.324 --> 03:11.225
BURT:
People went out,

03:11.259 --> 03:12.393
and they borrowed more money

03:12.426 --> 03:13.827
than they could afford.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.729
Now their houses are either
under water or upside down.

03:15.763 --> 03:18.266
While that sounds fun for
a weekend, it's no way to live.

03:18.299 --> 03:21.302
Jimmy, what's the worst
cartoon character?
Wimpy.

03:21.335 --> 03:22.370
Right. Because
he always wanted

03:22.403 --> 03:25.273
to pay Tuesday
for a hamburger today.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.240
With a gut like that,

03:26.274 --> 03:28.242
he should have been
eating the spinach anyway.

03:28.276 --> 03:30.411
I bet he got gout, and that's
why they canceled the cartoon.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.246
That's why your dad
and I always pay cash,

03:32.280 --> 03:34.415
and we never buy anything new.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.350
That way we always get
a much better deal.

03:36.384 --> 03:37.718
I mean, look at this fridge.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.320
We bought it used.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.454
Freezer works too good.

03:42.290 --> 03:45.293
There are tons of cars
in The Natesville Courier.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.860
We'll go looking with you
tomorrow.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.896
And if Sabrina gives
you a hard time,

03:48.929 --> 03:51.932
just remind her that she had
a boyfriend when you met her.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.534
You got her used.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.303
BURT:
Hold on.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.905
Think I got something.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.875
Oh, it's your harmonica.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.377
I thought
it would be refreshing

04:03.411 --> 04:05.913
to play a cold harmonica
on a hot day.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.915
(plays lively tune)

04:07.948 --> 04:09.950
(laughs)

04:11.785 --> 04:13.321
(muffled grunting, plays notes)

04:13.354 --> 04:14.422
It's stuck on my lips!

04:14.455 --> 04:15.556
(plays notes)

04:15.589 --> 04:16.424
Don't pull!

04:16.457 --> 04:17.591
Don't pull.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.360
(Burt groans,
notes play)

04:19.393 --> 04:20.928
(muffled murmuring)
No, no, no. That's gonna hurt!

04:20.961 --> 04:23.431
JIMMY:
So we started checking
The Natesville Courier.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.466
After the ten pages
of escort services,

04:25.499 --> 04:28.436
there were listings for a dozen
old cars in our price range,

04:28.469 --> 04:30.571
which was exactly $830
or under.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.307
What is with your guys'
irrational fear of credit?

04:33.341 --> 04:34.808
Everybody uses it.

04:34.842 --> 04:37.345
But if everybody jumped off
a cliff, would you?
I would.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.780
I wouldn't want to be the last
person left in the world.

04:39.813 --> 04:42.015
I mean, it would be cool
to spend one night

04:42.049 --> 04:43.451
in the White House
and everything.

04:43.484 --> 04:45.386
But after that,
right off a cliff.

04:45.419 --> 04:46.787
Now that we got
that major problem solved...

04:46.820 --> 04:48.689
All I was trying to say is,

04:48.722 --> 04:51.392
you're not going to find a lot
of decent cars for $830.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.327
We're not looking
for a lot-- just one.

04:53.361 --> 04:55.696
One diamond in the rough.

04:56.464 --> 04:58.432
(yells)

04:58.466 --> 05:00.401
Not a diamond.

05:01.469 --> 05:03.637
I can't believe
this is so cheap.

05:03.671 --> 05:04.538
We'll take it.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.574
(car alarm chirps)

05:07.975 --> 05:10.344
(laughs)

05:10.378 --> 05:11.412
Not a diamond.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.480
Oh, come on!

05:12.513 --> 05:13.814
It's just like
the nursery rhyme.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.383
I know another
fairy tale.

05:15.416 --> 05:18.352
We don't get it,
and we live happily ever after.

05:18.386 --> 05:19.887
Not a diamond.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.790
It's just as roomy as an SUV.

05:22.823 --> 05:26.494
The poor guy would have lived
if he'd only worn his seat belt.

05:26.527 --> 05:29.363
That reminds me--
this doesn't have seat belts.

05:29.397 --> 05:30.998
Gomez,
Morticia, Lurch,

05:31.031 --> 05:32.433
I'm out of here.

05:32.466 --> 05:33.200
If you're giving out nicknames,

05:33.233 --> 05:35.068
I'd like a say in it.

05:36.504 --> 05:37.838
I'm not selling it.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.740
I just thought
this would be a good way

05:39.773 --> 05:41.008
to meet fellow Pacer fans.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.510
Now that
you're here,

05:42.543 --> 05:44.144
you want
to go get some pizza

05:44.177 --> 05:46.013
and talk about
how awesome my Pacer is?

05:46.046 --> 05:47.381
BURT:
Whoa, look at this.

05:47.415 --> 05:49.617
I think Sabrina
left too soon.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.457
That's our diamond.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.426
But it's more than $830.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.528
We'll just have
to get creative.

06:00.561 --> 06:03.397
I promise you're
going to love this.

06:03.431 --> 06:05.365
Ooh, this is exciting!

06:08.636 --> 06:10.404
It's your
mother's car.
Not anymore.

06:10.438 --> 06:11.939
They gave it to us.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.907
As a gift?
Well, sort of.

06:13.941 --> 06:16.444
You see, we finally found
the diamond in the rough,

06:16.477 --> 06:18.579
but it was a bit
above my spending limit.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.448
So my parents kicked in
the extra money,

06:20.481 --> 06:23.717
and they gave us this car,
and they got their dream car.
Mm.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.118
(tires squealing in distance)

06:25.152 --> 06:27.154
*

06:35.929 --> 06:38.198
Is this amazing
or what?

06:38.231 --> 06:40.834
Roads? We don't need roads!

06:42.536 --> 06:44.605
Please cover
my eyes again.

06:44.638 --> 06:46.640
*

06:50.644 --> 06:52.813
See? This car's not so bad.

06:52.846 --> 06:55.449
And once you get a feel
for how to pump the brakes,

06:55.483 --> 06:56.650
it's actually not that hard
to stop.

06:56.684 --> 06:58.586
Oh, yeah. That and the fact

06:58.619 --> 07:00.120
that the radio shorts out
when the heater's on,

07:00.153 --> 07:01.922
the hood pops up
when you brake too fast,

07:01.955 --> 07:04.091
the power steering only works
on right turns.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.926
(grunting)
And... not...

07:05.959 --> 07:09.497
on... left... turns.

07:14.568 --> 07:15.903
JIMMY:
Where are we?

07:15.936 --> 07:18.238
SABRINA: At a place where
normal people buy cars.

07:18.271 --> 07:21.241
Look, this car is no safer
for Hope than your van was.

07:21.274 --> 07:24.512
Well...
Cars should not do this.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.514
I'm pretty sure if you pull
that hard on any steering wheel,

07:26.547 --> 07:28.549
it's gonna come off.
Let's find out.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.957
It adjusts up and down,
controls the radio,

07:36.990 --> 07:39.493
cruise control,
Bluetooth and climate,

07:39.527 --> 07:41.595
but it does not come off.

07:41.629 --> 07:42.930
(grunting)

07:42.963 --> 07:44.532
(panting)

07:44.565 --> 07:45.633
Well, the seat's
pretty comfortable.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.635
Oh, wait-- it gets better.
Hold on.

07:47.668 --> 07:48.802
Please be an ejector seat,

07:48.836 --> 07:49.970
please be an ejector seat,
please be... Oh!

07:50.003 --> 07:51.972
Oh, this is still cool.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.608
Huh?
(laughs)

07:57.210 --> 07:58.145
Heated seats are
great, right?

07:58.178 --> 08:01.515
My ass feels like
it just came out of a dryer.

08:01.549 --> 08:03.817
That kind of luxury
cannot come cheap.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.586
Just a few bucks more
on our monthly payment.

08:05.619 --> 08:06.887
That's it?
Mm-hmm.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.725
Your life is about to change,
my friend.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.797
Fresh air and sunshine,
anytime you want it,

08:16.830 --> 08:18.532
for just pennies a day.

08:18.566 --> 08:20.834
It just seems that if
there's an open roof...

08:20.868 --> 08:22.502
There is no
ejector seat, Jimmy.

08:24.572 --> 08:27.040
Oh, I can't
get enough of that.

08:27.074 --> 08:28.742
It's called
"new car smell."

08:28.776 --> 08:30.578
How much do they charge
for that?

08:30.611 --> 08:31.912
It's free.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.714
Oh, we'll take it!

08:33.747 --> 08:35.148
Congratulations.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.750
You just chose
the most reliable,

08:36.784 --> 08:38.586
affordable, family
car on the market.

08:38.619 --> 08:41.154
Now let's go do
some paperwork.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.923
(sniffing)

08:42.956 --> 08:44.658
How about I stay,
sign the paperwork,

08:44.692 --> 08:47.928
you pick up Hope, and I will
meet you at home with a new car?

08:47.961 --> 08:51.865
Jimmy, this is the first new car
in Chance family history.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.166
You should frame the title

08:53.200 --> 08:54.935
and put it up next
to your college di...

08:54.968 --> 08:57.204
Next to your high school di...

08:57.237 --> 08:58.906
Never mind.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.708
I love you.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.644
See you at home.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.915
(inhaling)

09:07.948 --> 09:09.650
VIRGINIA:
The engine on this thing

09:09.683 --> 09:11.018
runs a little rough.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.053
You really think
it can get up to 88?

09:13.086 --> 09:14.722
Only one way to find out.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.289
(engine revving)

09:16.323 --> 09:18.892
If you really could go back
in time, what would you do?

09:18.926 --> 09:20.728
Remember that time
we drove back from the lake...

09:20.761 --> 09:21.729
Mm.
...and I said I could

09:21.762 --> 09:23.063
make it all the way home

09:23.096 --> 09:24.297
without stopping
to go to the bathroom?

09:24.331 --> 09:25.766
I'd stop.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.134
I would go back in time

09:27.167 --> 09:28.736
and not make chili
when we were up at the lake.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.071
Here we go.

09:31.104 --> 09:34.174
(engine revving)

09:39.312 --> 09:41.649
(Burt laughs)

09:41.682 --> 09:42.683
Sixty...

09:43.717 --> 09:44.918
Sixty-five...

09:46.687 --> 09:47.755
Seventy!

09:48.656 --> 09:49.923
Seventy-three!

09:52.192 --> 09:53.727
Seventy-eight!

09:53.761 --> 09:54.762
(gasps)

09:54.795 --> 09:56.096
Ow! Stop it, Burt!

09:56.129 --> 09:57.230
She's breaking up!

09:57.264 --> 09:58.832
She's breaking up!

09:58.866 --> 10:01.234
(screaming)

10:01.268 --> 10:04.404
BURT:
Well, that was disappointing.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.773
I mean, I'm not an idiot.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.841
I know we don't have
a flux capacitor,

10:07.875 --> 10:09.710
but I thought,
if we could get it up to 88,

10:09.743 --> 10:10.844
maybe something would happen.

10:10.878 --> 10:12.780
It's probably best
that it didn't.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.815
Remember that movie
The Butterfly Effect?

10:14.848 --> 10:18.385
We would have had to sit
through that stupid thing twice.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.825
Put down the pen, Jimmy.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.326
I just ran your credit.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.428
You've got a score of 91.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.297
Oh, that's an "A," right?

10:30.330 --> 10:31.832
It's out of 850.

10:31.865 --> 10:34.868
This is the worst credit score
we've ever seen.

10:34.902 --> 10:37.437
It's the hardest my manager's
laughed since I showed her

10:37.470 --> 10:40.107
that Internet video of guys
getting kicked in the jingles.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.042
Have you seen that?

10:42.075 --> 10:43.343
Oh, here, this'll cheer you up.

10:43.376 --> 10:44.678
I don't understand.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.179
I've never had
a credit card.

10:46.213 --> 10:47.848
I've never taken
out a loan.

10:47.881 --> 10:48.949
I've never even
borrowed lunch money.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.684
How can my credit be bad?

10:50.718 --> 10:53.987
Well, according
to this, in 1993,

10:54.021 --> 10:55.689
you opened a credit card,

10:55.723 --> 10:57.725
and made a bunch of charges
you never paid.

10:57.758 --> 11:00.761
Do you remember signing
any documents as a kid?

11:00.794 --> 11:04.164
Well, my mom used to make me
practice signing my autograph

11:04.197 --> 11:06.466
in case I ever
became a movie star.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.201
You're my favorite
movie star.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.473
Can I have your autograph?

11:13.506 --> 11:15.008
Okay.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.744
Great.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.746
Sign here, here, and here.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.213
Initials here and here.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.082
And we're going to need
this one in triplicate.

11:22.115 --> 11:23.717
No.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.085
They wouldn't.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.254
Says you owe six grand
for a hot tub.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.490
How can we afford a hot tub

11:30.523 --> 11:32.760
and I can't get new shoes?

11:34.828 --> 11:36.864
Because your feet are gonna
keep growing, buddy,

11:36.897 --> 11:38.732
but this hot tub
will fit us forever.

11:38.766 --> 11:41.034
Now go to bed, and don't
forget to wipe your toes

11:41.068 --> 11:42.369
before you go inside.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.104
Ugh...

11:44.137 --> 11:46.273
These debts are from
over 20 years ago.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.776
I'm sure creditors
must have been calling you.

11:48.809 --> 11:51.078
(phone ringing)

11:51.111 --> 11:52.746
Hello?

11:52.780 --> 11:55.382
This is Dennis Powers
from the Bank of Natesville.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.818
I'm calling for James Chance.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.921
Dad, it's that guy
who prank calls us again.

12:00.954 --> 12:03.023
Let him have it, son.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.258
Say hello to my butt.

12:05.292 --> 12:06.359
(farting)

12:06.393 --> 12:09.262
That's not funny or effective

12:09.296 --> 12:11.131
since I can't
smell it from here.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.232
(farts)

12:12.265 --> 12:14.034
If you continue to mock me,

12:14.067 --> 12:15.268
I'll freeze your credit.

12:15.302 --> 12:16.303
(farting over phone)

12:17.337 --> 12:18.305
(squirting sound)

12:18.338 --> 12:19.807
Uh-oh.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.842
I gambled and I lost!

12:24.177 --> 12:26.213
Wow, that sounds traumatic.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.149
Which makes it even harder to
ask for all this stuff back.

12:34.822 --> 12:36.824
Virginia, I did it!

12:42.863 --> 12:45.432
(makes whooshing sound
like DeLorean door opening)

12:45.465 --> 12:47.234
We're a DeLorean house now.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.302
Finally, people will be
pointing at our house

12:49.336 --> 12:50.470
for all the right reasons.

12:50.503 --> 12:51.839
(rattling doorknob)

12:51.872 --> 12:53.573
Mom? Dad?

12:53.606 --> 12:54.842
Back up.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.844
Just back up.
And be careful.

12:56.877 --> 12:59.179
I already smacked the mailman's
chin pretty hard.

12:59.212 --> 13:00.881
(whooshing)

13:00.914 --> 13:02.182
DeLorean door.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.852
Yeah, that won't get old.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.454
I cannot believe what you guys
did to me when I was a kid.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.122
I mean, you have done
some awful things,

13:09.156 --> 13:10.958
but this-- this has
to be the worst.

13:10.991 --> 13:14.361
Oh, my God, he found out Maw Maw
performed his circumcision.

13:14.394 --> 13:17.030
She learned how to do it
during the war.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.031
You barely cried.

13:18.065 --> 13:20.000
You stole my identity!

13:20.033 --> 13:22.035
What?
We would never do that.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.204
You took out a credit card
in my name when I was five.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.305
Oh, that.

13:25.338 --> 13:26.974
Yeah, we did kind of do that.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.508
But it wasn't
our fault, Jimmy.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.477
We had no idea how
credit cards worked.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.179
One day, your dad
was at the bank

13:32.212 --> 13:34.314
and they were handing out
these really cool fanny packs

13:34.347 --> 13:36.016
if he signed up
for a credit card.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.851
It wasn't a lame one.
It was leather.

13:37.885 --> 13:40.287
And when the credit card
showed up with his name on it,

13:40.320 --> 13:41.922
we could buy all our dream stuff

13:41.955 --> 13:43.623
from those late-night
infomercials.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.492
Smokin' Joe Frazier Grill,

13:45.525 --> 13:46.994
Andrew Dice Clay Dicer,

13:47.027 --> 13:48.929
Rowdy Roddy Piper
Popcorn Popper.

13:48.962 --> 13:51.398
The Henry Winkler Sprinkler.
The Bret Michaels
Poison Control Kit.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.901
And a whole set of knives
that could cut through a can.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.136
I used to ask your mom if
she wanted to split a beer,

13:56.169 --> 13:57.637
then I'd cut that
sucker right in two.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.040
But before we maxed out
your dad's card,

14:00.073 --> 14:01.875
they sent us another one,
through the mail,

14:01.909 --> 14:03.376
with my name on it.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.512
And that's when
we really went to town.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.014
Big-ticket items, Jimmy.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.882
Things rich people have:

14:08.916 --> 14:10.183
night-vision goggles,

14:10.217 --> 14:12.152
an answering machine/phone
combo,

14:12.185 --> 14:13.586
an electric card-shuffler,

14:13.620 --> 14:15.923
a Darth Vader boombox
with a lightsaber antenna.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.490
We spent hundreds.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.659
So when you were telling me
that you never used credit

14:19.692 --> 14:21.895
because it was bad,
that was a load of crap.

14:21.929 --> 14:25.365
No, we were trying to protect
you from the evil, Jimmy.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.901
We knew we had a problem,

14:27.935 --> 14:30.037
but luckily, we reached
our limit on both our cards.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.572
So there's no way anyone was
gonna send us another one again.

14:32.605 --> 14:34.908
But the Devil had other plans.

14:34.942 --> 14:37.010
One day, a new card
arrived in the mail...

14:37.044 --> 14:38.545
with your name on it.

14:38.578 --> 14:41.081
The bastard went
after our child.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.615
We could have easily
sliced through that card

14:42.649 --> 14:44.051
with our fancy new knives,

14:44.084 --> 14:46.086
then effortlessly
cut through a tomato,

14:46.119 --> 14:48.989
but we were young and
we really wanted a hot tub.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.390
And besides,

14:50.423 --> 14:52.592
we thought there was a "statue
of imitations" on credit.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.394
We thought your record
would be clean

14:54.427 --> 14:56.029
by the time you were an adult.

14:58.098 --> 15:01.034
We never meant to
hurt you, Jimmy.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.535
Tomorrow morning,
we're going to the bank.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.204
We're gonna tell
them what we did,

15:04.237 --> 15:05.205
and we're gonna clear your name.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.539
And then that's it.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.108
We're not making
bad decisions anymore.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.110
While we're there, we can
grab some lunch next door

15:10.143 --> 15:11.311
at that Mexican-Indian
restaurant

15:11.344 --> 15:12.579
the health department
finally reopened.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.081
JIMMY:
Oh, that's a good idea.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.548
I heard their power
went out the other day

15:15.582 --> 15:17.084
for 18 hours and they're selling
anything with chicken in it

15:17.117 --> 15:19.019
for real cheap.
Sounds great.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.420
We'll take
the East River Bridge.

15:20.453 --> 15:21.921
There's almost no traffic
since it started cracking.

15:26.159 --> 15:29.029
Oh, yes...

15:29.062 --> 15:33.000
I seem to have quite a few
notes on you in this file.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.302
Hah. "The phone farter."

15:35.335 --> 15:38.571
It's not his fault.
He was five years old.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.641
Isn't there any way we can
just pay back what we spent?

15:41.674 --> 15:44.577
Well, I suppose we could
transfer this debt

15:44.611 --> 15:46.013
to the two of you.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.015
Which, with penalties
and interest,

15:48.048 --> 15:52.485
comes to $125,000.76.

15:52.519 --> 15:55.322
Two questions: can we pay
that with a credit card,

15:55.355 --> 15:57.124
and can we get a credit card?

15:57.157 --> 15:59.759
Can't they just pay back
the amount that they borrowed?

15:59.792 --> 16:01.261
It doesn't work that way.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.130
Rules are rules.

16:03.163 --> 16:06.133
What do you think, there's
a magic button I can press

16:06.166 --> 16:08.568
that'll make your penalties
and interest disappear?

16:11.038 --> 16:12.605
Actually, there is.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.707
This one...

16:16.243 --> 16:17.677
...right here.

16:20.713 --> 16:22.449
Nice try,

16:22.482 --> 16:24.284
but these are
the fastest fingers

16:24.317 --> 16:26.219
in the Natesville branch.

16:26.253 --> 16:28.521
That's why I've
never been caught

16:28.555 --> 16:31.224
picking my nose at a red light.

16:31.258 --> 16:33.093
And I do it a lot.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.795
I'm not going to help you.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.698
I detest reckless spenders

16:38.731 --> 16:40.567
who live above their means.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.135
But we're not like that anymore.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.204
I swear. We never buy
anything we can't afford.

16:44.237 --> 16:48.075
He's not lying.
We all work hard at
our part-time jobs.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.742
Plus, we coupon and
live in a crappy house

16:49.776 --> 16:51.211
with my crazy great-grandmother.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.080
Oh...

16:53.113 --> 16:57.650
I live with my elderly mother.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.287
Oh, it's not easy...

17:01.688 --> 17:03.323
...but I love her.

17:03.356 --> 17:07.160
I know exactly
how you feel, Dennis.

17:07.194 --> 17:10.063
You got to take care of them
the way they took care of you.

17:11.264 --> 17:12.832
Does yours bite, too?

17:12.865 --> 17:15.068
(quietly): Not now, Burt.
I'm doing something here.

17:15.102 --> 17:20.073
It does sound like you've
learned your lesson.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.508
Yeah.

17:21.541 --> 17:22.775
I guess everybody
makes mistakes

17:22.809 --> 17:24.211
when they're younger.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.114
I'm gonna help you folks out.

17:27.147 --> 17:29.249
Hey, Dennis,

17:29.282 --> 17:31.284
some idiot parked
in my handicap spot.

17:31.318 --> 17:33.086
I'm gonna call a tow truck,

17:33.120 --> 17:34.554
but you might
want to check it out.

17:34.587 --> 17:35.588
It's your dream car.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.124
(gasps)

17:40.127 --> 17:42.529
Whoa, Betty!

17:42.562 --> 17:44.531
I wish I was rich enough

17:44.564 --> 17:48.135
to waste money on
a sweet ride like this.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.302
Yeah.

17:49.336 --> 17:51.271
I feel dirty just
being next to it.

17:51.304 --> 17:55.142
Maybe we should go back inside
and finish fixing Jimmy's debt.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.087
It's hot out, huh?

18:14.327 --> 18:17.197
You almost pulled one
over on old Dennis.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.266
Sure, you've changed your ways.

18:19.299 --> 18:23.136
Sure, you don't live
above your means.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.505
You only drive the
sweetest car ever built.

18:25.538 --> 18:26.739
But you don't understand.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.508
They found their diamond
in the rough.

18:28.541 --> 18:32.679
Stop. Just stop.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.614
Other than when I'm at
a gentleman's club,

18:34.647 --> 18:36.516
I don't like being lied to.

18:36.549 --> 18:40.753
I'm going to
personally make sure

18:40.787 --> 18:44.224
that this debt follows
you to your grave.

18:44.257 --> 18:45.458
Uh...

18:47.494 --> 18:49.762
Wait, Dennis.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.199
It's probably hard to believe,
knowing we own that car,

18:52.232 --> 18:54.301
but as parents, we've
made tons of mistakes.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.803
But up till now, we've always
been able to fix it

18:56.836 --> 18:59.306
so they didn't follow Jimmy
around for the rest of his life.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.241
That's not true.
It is true, Jimmy.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.342
We've been terrible parents.

19:02.375 --> 19:03.810
Oh, no, no, no,
that part's true.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.612
But the mistakes you made,
they followed me around.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.347
You never made me
do my homework,

19:07.380 --> 19:08.481
which is why I couldn't
get any job

19:08.515 --> 19:09.782
that required any education.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.251
You never took me
to the dentist,

19:11.284 --> 19:12.952
so when the wind blows,
my gums bleed.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.188
And you never let me
make my own decisions,

19:15.222 --> 19:17.357
which is why I rely
on you and my fiancée

19:17.390 --> 19:18.691
to tell me what to do.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.960
Jimmy, we tried our best.
Oh, yeah?

19:20.993 --> 19:23.630
Was your best letting my
great-grandmother circumcise me?

19:23.663 --> 19:26.233
I mean, it's no wonder I always
pee a little bit to the left.

19:26.266 --> 19:27.734
What do you expect me to do?

19:27.767 --> 19:29.536
Pull foreskin out of my pocket
and reattach it?

19:29.569 --> 19:31.304
Please give Jimmy
his credit back.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.905
We'll give you
anything you want.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.577
Her.

19:37.610 --> 19:40.813
I want her.

19:40.847 --> 19:43.716
Well, I am flattered, but...

19:45.285 --> 19:47.287
Ah...

19:48.921 --> 19:50.590
JIMMY:
It wasn't how they imagined it,

19:50.623 --> 19:53.226
but Mom and Dad did
get to use the DeLorean

19:53.260 --> 19:55.362
to go back in time
and change the past.

19:55.395 --> 19:56.663
Ah.

19:56.696 --> 19:57.997
Oof!

19:58.030 --> 20:00.233
JIMMY:
And I got my credit back.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.439
In the end, the one good thing

20:06.473 --> 20:08.241
that came out of my parents
ruining my credit

20:08.275 --> 20:10.277
was that I was
determined not to.

20:13.646 --> 20:14.947
Oh! Should we get
the navigation?

20:14.981 --> 20:16.383
Ah, I know my way
around Natesville.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.617
The rear-view camera?

20:17.650 --> 20:19.319
That's what back
bumpers are for.

20:19.352 --> 20:20.320
The entertainment system?

20:20.353 --> 20:21.721
So many people have those.

20:21.754 --> 20:23.290
We'll just tailgate a mini-van

20:23.323 --> 20:24.757
and Hope can see as
many movies as she wants.

20:24.791 --> 20:27.327
Sunroof?
We'll take the basic model.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.862
And is there any way
that you can finance that

20:29.896 --> 20:31.331
under the name "Hope Chance"?

20:33.300 --> 20:34.967
I'm just kidding.

20:41.408 --> 20:44.444
Come on, come on...
you're getting closer.

20:44.477 --> 20:45.478
Come on! Out of the way!

20:46.746 --> 20:47.714
Come on!

20:47.747 --> 20:48.781
Just a little more.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.318
Almost there...

20:52.452 --> 20:54.821
Come on...

20:54.854 --> 20:56.289
Yes!

20:56.323 --> 20:57.990
(laughs) Yes! Yes!

20:59.359 --> 21:00.560
Holy crap!

21:00.593 --> 21:01.761
Ah!

21:03.496 --> 21:05.332
(horse whinnies)

21:05.365 --> 21:06.499
Wha...?

21:11.771 --> 21:13.440
Oh, my God!

21:13.473 --> 21:15.442
It worked!

21:15.475 --> 21:16.443
What year is it?

21:16.476 --> 21:18.345
Is it 2013?

21:18.378 --> 21:21.080
Nope. Here at Howdy's,
it's 1829.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.316
Hey, why don't you mosey into
Howdy's General Store

21:23.350 --> 21:25.352
for a five-cent sarsaparilla?

21:25.385 --> 21:26.486
No time, partner.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.521
I'm off to the year 2008

21:28.555 --> 21:31.023
to marry Susan Boyle

21:31.057 --> 21:33.025
before she got rich and famous.
(laughing)

21:35.995 --> 21:38.998
Child:
Do something nice tomorrow.
