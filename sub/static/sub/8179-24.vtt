WEBVTT

00:05.471 --> 00:07.989
HELLO.

00:08.055 --> 00:09.991
A POLITICAL POLL?

00:10.058 --> 00:12.727
I NEVER HAVE BEFORE,
BUT GO AHEAD, SHOOT.

00:13.562 --> 00:17.965
I DON'T KNOW.

00:18.033 --> 00:21.136
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

00:21.203 --> 00:22.870
WHO?

00:22.938 --> 00:25.006
OHH, RIGHT.

00:25.073 --> 00:26.807
I DON'T KNOW.

00:28.594 --> 00:30.095
UH, HELLO?

00:31.497 --> 00:35.800
ONE MOMENT, DOUGLAS,
I'M MAKING A PHONE CALL.

00:35.868 --> 00:39.020
YEAH. I'M ALREADY ON THE
PHONE, OK? I'M TAKING A POLL.

00:39.087 --> 00:40.772
MY APOLOGIES.
CARRY ON.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.340
SORRY ABOUT THAT, GUY.
GO AHEAD.

00:43.409 --> 00:44.542
I DON'T KNOW.

00:44.610 --> 00:45.760
HOW COULD YOU
NOT KNOW THAT?

00:45.828 --> 00:47.562
ARTHUR, WOULD YOU
JUST HANG UP, PLEASE?!

00:47.630 --> 00:48.329
WHY SHOULD I?

00:48.397 --> 00:50.415
THE MAN'S CONDUCTING
A POLITICAL POLL

00:50.483 --> 00:53.685
AND HE HAS A RIGHT TO SPEAK TO
SOMEONE WHO'S NOT AN IGNORAMUS!

00:53.752 --> 00:56.354
IF YOU'RE SO SMART, WHY DON'T YOU
TELL HIM THAT YOU LIVE IN MY BASEMENT?

00:56.422 --> 00:58.657
WHY DON'T YOU TELL HIM
YOU'RE ENORMOUS?

00:58.724 --> 01:02.443
WHY DON'T YOU TELL HIM THAT YOUR
TOTAL SALARY LAST YEAR WAS $12?!

01:02.511 --> 01:03.962
THAT WAS AFTER TAXES!

01:05.230 --> 01:07.532
ARTHUR, JUST STOP TALKING,
WOULD YOU, PLEASE?

01:07.600 --> 01:10.935
SORRY ABOUT THAT, GUY-
HELLO? HELLO?

01:12.000 --> 01:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:45.988 --> 01:47.538
GET READY TO LAUGH.

01:47.606 --> 01:49.757
HON, I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING HERE, OK?

01:49.825 --> 01:51.092
I'M ON MY ROUTE TODAY,
RIGHT?

01:51.159 --> 01:53.828
DOUG? MOMMY'S BUSY.

01:53.896 --> 01:55.663
BUT THIS IS A REALLY
FUNNY STORY.

01:55.731 --> 01:57.632
OK, JUST BECAUSE I'M DOING
THIS PROJECT FROM HOME

01:57.700 --> 01:59.734
DOESN'T MEAN I'M SITTING
AROUND HERE DOING NOTHING. OK?

01:59.801 --> 02:01.669
MY BOSS WANTS ME
TO TRANSLATE

02:01.737 --> 02:04.589
THIS HUMONGOUS PIECE
OF REAL ESTATE JARGON CRAP

02:04.657 --> 02:08.276
INTO LAYMAN'S TERMS SO A
JURY CAN UNDERSTAND IT, OK?

02:08.344 --> 02:10.562
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR YOUR LITTLE STORY.

02:10.628 --> 02:16.016
<i>MM-HMM, BUT YOU DID
HAVE TIME FOR THAT STORY.</i>

02:16.084 --> 02:18.620
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
WAS A SNOOZEFEST.

02:18.687 --> 02:19.787
PLEASE?

02:19.855 --> 02:21.956
FINE.

02:26.662 --> 02:29.214
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I
ASKED YOU NOT TO DO THAT?

02:29.282 --> 02:31.883
I'M SORRY. LOOK, I'M CLEARLY
STARVED FOR ATTENTION.

02:31.950 --> 02:34.619
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
TELL ME YOUR DAMN STORY!

02:34.687 --> 02:35.804
I'M IN MY TRUCK, RIGHT?
I'M MAKING MY STOPS.

02:35.871 --> 02:37.305
NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY,

02:37.372 --> 02:39.908
WHEN I LOOK DOWN AT THE ADDRESS
LABEL ON MY NEXT DELIVERY.

02:39.976 --> 02:42.310
GUESS WHAT THE GUY'S NAME IS?

02:42.377 --> 02:43.478
I DON'T KNOW. WHAT?

02:43.545 --> 02:44.979
BUBKA PENIS.

02:48.216 --> 02:50.852
GIMME A BREAK. THAT'S
NOT THE GUY'S REAL NAME.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.069
YES, IT WAS.
I ASKED HIM FOR PROOF.

02:52.137 --> 02:54.105
HE SHOWED ME
HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE.

02:54.172 --> 02:57.992
DOUG, NOBODY'S LAST NAME
IS PENIS.

02:58.059 --> 03:01.462
<i>NOBODY FROM THIS COUNTRY,
SNOB.</i>

03:01.530 --> 03:03.514
HE HAPPENS
TO BE FROM ISRAEL.

03:03.549 --> 03:05.934
APPARENTLY IT'S LIKE SMITH
OVER THERE.

03:06.002 --> 03:08.687
OK, SO IS THAT IT?
IS THAT YOUR STORY?

03:08.754 --> 03:12.741
KNOW WHAT? IF YOU DIDN'T LAUGH
AT A RALPH PENIS, I'D UNDERSTAND.

03:13.926 --> 03:14.626
BUT BUBKA?

03:17.562 --> 03:18.480
COME ON IN, HOLLY!

03:18.547 --> 03:20.181
HEY, ARTHUR, YOU READY
FOR YOUR WALK?

03:20.248 --> 03:23.117
I'VE BEEN READY SINCE YOU
DROPPED ME OFF ON TUESDAY.

03:23.185 --> 03:26.987
OK, WELL, I GUESS
WE SHOULD GET GOING, THEN.

03:27.055 --> 03:28.123
WHAT'S WRONG?

03:28.190 --> 03:30.625
NOTHING. NOTHING.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

03:30.693 --> 03:33.962
NOW LET'S GO ENJOY
THIS BEAUTIFUL DAY!

03:35.531 --> 03:36.581
I CAN'T SHAKE
THE FEELING

03:36.648 --> 03:38.800
THAT SOMETHING'S
BOTHERING YOU.

03:38.868 --> 03:41.536
I'M GETTING KICKED OUT
OF MY APARTMENT.

03:41.603 --> 03:42.804
WHY?

03:42.872 --> 03:44.004
THE GUY I WAS
SUBLETTING IT FROM,

03:44.072 --> 03:45.506
HE WAS LIVING WITH SOMEONE.

03:45.574 --> 03:48.343
WELL, NOW HE'S STARTING TO THINK
THAT MAYBE HE'S NOT GAY.

03:48.410 --> 03:49.960
UGH, IT'S A WHOLE STORY.

03:50.028 --> 03:51.011
WHERE WILL YOU GO?

03:51.079 --> 03:52.447
I DON'T KNOW.

03:52.514 --> 03:54.415
MAYBE MY STEP-BROTHER'S
TOOL SHED.

03:54.483 --> 03:55.517
HE'S GONNA LET ME KNOW.

03:55.584 --> 03:56.718
NONSENSE.

03:56.785 --> 03:58.469
YOU'LL STAY HERE WITH ME
IN THE BASEMENT

03:58.537 --> 03:59.670
TILL YOU FIND A NEW PLACE.

03:59.738 --> 04:01.472
NO. NO, I COULDN'T.

04:01.540 --> 04:03.424
THERE'LL BE
NO HANKY-PANKY.

04:04.760 --> 04:05.927
TO BE HONEST,

04:05.995 --> 04:09.263
THE WHOLE DOG-WALKER THING
IS A PRETTY BIG TURN-OFF.

04:09.331 --> 04:11.349
LET ME JUST ASK THE KIDS.

04:14.152 --> 04:16.904
HOLLY'S GETTING KICKED OUT
OF HER APARTMENT.

04:16.971 --> 04:18.740
CAN SHE STAY WITH US?

04:20.058 --> 04:22.894
WELL, DAD, IT'S, UH,
KIND OF HARD TO SAY NO

04:22.961 --> 04:26.097
WHEN SHE'S STANDING
3 FEET AWAY FROM US.

04:26.165 --> 04:28.466
SHE'S IN A DIFFERENT ROOM!

04:28.534 --> 04:29.717
OK, NOT REALLY
A DIFFERENT ROOM

04:29.785 --> 04:32.720
WHEN YOU CAN WAVE
TO HER FROM THIS ONE.

04:34.823 --> 04:38.326
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A YES.

04:42.430 --> 04:44.565
ARE YOU COMING DOWN
FOR BREAKFAST?

04:44.633 --> 04:47.368
NO. I HAVE
TOO MUCH TO DO.

04:47.435 --> 04:49.370
YOU GOT
TO HAVE BREAKFAST.

04:49.437 --> 04:51.372
HONEY, I'M FINE.
JUST GO AHEAD.

05:01.383 --> 05:03.550
WHAT'S HAPPENING
HERE, BABY?

05:05.520 --> 05:08.439
WELL, HOLLY'S GONNA
BE DOWN THERE AND...

05:08.507 --> 05:09.974
I'LL HAVE TO...

05:10.042 --> 05:11.709
TALK TO HER.

05:11.777 --> 05:14.929
SO? YOU TALK TO HER
ALL THE TIME.

05:14.997 --> 05:16.330
NO. I SAY HELLO
AND GOOD-BYE,

05:16.398 --> 05:19.233
BUT NOW WE'LL BE
JUST SITTING THERE EATING

05:19.301 --> 05:23.738
AND IT'LL BE, LIKE, "HEY,
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH MILK?"

05:25.307 --> 05:27.107
SO THEN
DON'T TALK TO HER.

05:27.175 --> 05:28.492
THAT'S MORE AWKWARD.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.328
DOUG, THEN SKIP
BREAKFAST, OK?

05:30.395 --> 05:32.564
OH, YOU'D LIKE THAT,
WOULDN'T YOU?

07:18.887 --> 07:21.255
ARTHUR, I'M GONNA
GO GRAB SOME BREAKFAST!

07:23.458 --> 07:24.592
OKEY-DOKE!

07:24.659 --> 07:25.760
MORNING, DOUG.

07:25.828 --> 07:28.930
HEY.

07:28.997 --> 07:31.332
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANKS
AGAIN FOR TAKING ME IN.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.032
I REALLY
APPRECIATE THAT.

07:32.100 --> 07:34.318
NO PROBLEM.

07:37.823 --> 07:39.540
WANT SOME CEREAL?

07:39.608 --> 07:40.391
SURE.

07:40.458 --> 07:41.476
OK.

07:44.713 --> 07:45.846
HEH.

07:49.384 --> 07:50.718
THERE YOU GO. YEAH.

08:22.484 --> 08:24.218
CEREAL.

08:26.054 --> 08:28.339
IT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.

08:28.407 --> 08:29.774
MM-HMM.

08:31.327 --> 08:34.861
HEY, ARTHUR! COME ON UP
FOR BREAKFAST, BUDDY!

08:34.929 --> 08:39.200
YOU KNOW I CAN'T START MY DAY
WITHOUT MY 2 SCOOPS OF ARTIE!

08:39.267 --> 08:42.870
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS,
BUT IT SOUNDS TERRIFYING!

08:58.620 --> 09:01.889
FUNNY THING HAPPENED TO ME
THE OTHER DAY AT WORK.

09:03.692 --> 09:05.092
REALLY? WHAT?

09:05.360 --> 09:08.529
I DELIVERED A PACKAGE TO
THIS GUY NAMED BUBKA PENIS.

09:17.372 --> 09:18.939
HANDS UP!
HANDS UP! HANDS UP!

09:19.007 --> 09:19.973
THERE YOU GO.

09:21.709 --> 09:24.295
OH, MAN, I AM SORRY.

09:24.362 --> 09:27.164
THAT WAS JUST-
THAT WAS SO FUNNY.

09:27.232 --> 09:29.901
D- DON'T APOLOGIZE.
IT WAS FUNNY.

09:29.968 --> 09:31.869
GOD, FUNNY THINGS
MUST HAPPEN TO YOU

09:31.937 --> 09:33.454
ALL THE TIME
ON YOUR JOB.

09:33.522 --> 09:35.222
OH, THEY DO. THEY DO.
HERE. HAVE SOME MORE CEREAL.

09:35.290 --> 09:36.223
OH, THANK YOU.

09:40.496 --> 09:42.696
HEY, YOU, UH,
COMING DOWN FOR BREAKFAST?

09:42.764 --> 09:43.647
NAH.

09:43.715 --> 09:44.765

09:47.336 --> 09:49.119
HEY.

09:50.856 --> 09:52.973
OH, I GOT UP EARLY, SO I
THOUGHT I'D MAKE SOME BREAKFAST,

09:52.992 --> 09:55.843
JUST A LITTLE THANK-YOU
FOR HAVING ME.

09:55.911 --> 09:58.679
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME PANCAKES,
EGGS, AND HAND-CUT BACON?

09:58.747 --> 10:00.031
YES, YES, AND...

10:00.099 --> 10:01.799
HELL, YES.

10:01.867 --> 10:04.101
WELL, IT'LL BE READY
IN JUST ONE SECOND.

10:10.175 --> 10:11.341
OH, I'M SORRY.

10:11.409 --> 10:13.127

10:13.195 --> 10:15.830
I'LL GIVE 5 BUCKS

10:18.700 --> 10:21.068
GET OUT!

10:21.136 --> 10:22.936
WOW! YOU THE MAN.

10:23.004 --> 10:25.206
I DON'T KNOW IF I
HAVE 5 BUCKS ON ME.

10:25.274 --> 10:27.408
OOH, I DO HAVE
THIS ARBY'S COUPON.

10:27.476 --> 10:29.426
THAT'S AS GOOD AS CASH

10:29.494 --> 10:30.794
GREAT.
WELL, HAVE A SEAT.

10:30.863 --> 10:32.964
I'VE GOT A LOT

10:34.766 --> 10:36.968
OK.

10:38.036 --> 10:40.004
OH, HEY, YOU WANT ME

LET'S HAVE SEX.

11:13.655 --> 11:15.089

13:04.466 --> 13:08.035
THANK YOU, DOWNSTAIRS WIFE.

13:08.102 --> 13:11.255
MY NIPPLES ARE HARD.

13:13.775 --> 13:14.892
THIS IS DISGUSTING!

13:14.959 --> 13:16.260
THIS IS AN INSULT
TO CARRIE.

13:16.328 --> 13:17.661
SHE'S THE WOMAN
YOU VOWED

13:17.729 --> 13:19.330
TO SPEND THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE WITH.

13:19.398 --> 13:20.564
LOOK, IF I HAD TO
CHOOSE ONE OF THEM,

13:20.632 --> 13:22.232
I'D PROBABLY
CHOOSE HER.

13:22.300 --> 13:24.134
YOU DO
HAVE TO CHOOSE!

13:24.202 --> 13:27.237
MMM, NOT AT THE MOMENT. OHHH.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.908
I GOT 2 KIDS.
DO I GET AN EXTRA WIFE?

13:30.976 --> 13:34.011
NO. THAT GOES
TO THE WHITE MAN.

13:34.079 --> 13:35.596
THIS IS NOT JUST GOOD
FOR ME, ALL RIGHT?

13:35.664 --> 13:37.297
THIS SUNDAY, THE FIGHT

13:39.868 --> 13:41.469
SO WE CAN SMOKE
ALL THE STOGIES WE WANT.

13:41.536 --> 13:44.071
PLUS, HOLLY KNOWS A GUY
WHO CAN GET US CUBANS.

13:44.138 --> 13:45.139
OK, THOSE
ARE ILLEGAL.

13:45.206 --> 13:46.140
I'VE-I'VE HAD IT.

13:46.207 --> 13:48.025
YOU GUYS
DON'T RESPECT MARRIAGE

13:48.092 --> 13:50.061

13:52.280 --> 13:54.365
SO, ANY REQUESTS

13:54.432 --> 13:55.599
'CAUSE HOLLY

13:55.666 --> 13:57.534
I SAY WE GO WITH,
LIKE, A TACO BAR.

13:57.602 --> 13:59.302
HOLLY WILL PROBABLY BE
CIRCULATING AROUND HERE

13:59.370 --> 14:00.971
WITH HORS D'OEUVRES, SO
NO ONE'S GONNA GO HUNGR-

14:01.039 --> 14:02.773
HEY. CAN I HELP YOU?

14:04.192 --> 14:05.976

14:07.279 --> 14:08.295
AND THEN
I FINISHED EARLY,

14:08.363 --> 14:09.363
SO FOR THE REST
OF THE WEEKEND

14:09.430 --> 14:11.766
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME

YEAH. JUST DO ME A FAVOR

14:16.404 --> 14:18.422
MAKE SURE IT'S NOT
TOO COMPLICATED, OK?

14:20.358 --> 14:21.575
'KAY, NOT SURE
IF I LIKE WORK BOOTS

14:21.643 --> 14:23.210
ON THE COFFEE TABLE,
OK?

14:23.278 --> 14:25.662
UH, SORRY.
THANK YOU.

14:25.730 --> 14:28.515
UH, HON, IS THIS SUPPOSED
TO BE UNDERSTANDABLE

14:28.583 --> 14:29.984
TO REGULAR PEOPLE?

14:30.051 --> 14:30.985
YEAH. WHY?

14:31.052 --> 14:32.586
WELL, LIKE
THIS PART HERE:

14:32.653 --> 14:35.088
"THE JURORS SHOULD ONLY
CONSIDER EVIDENCE

14:35.157 --> 14:38.225
GERMANE TO THE ISSUES
AT HAND."

14:39.126 --> 14:42.463
What?!
WHAT?

14:42.531 --> 14:44.214
I'M TOTALLY LOST HERE. WHAT,
ARE YOU SUING JERMAINE JACKSON?

14:44.282 --> 14:46.149
IS HE SUING YOU?
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

14:46.217 --> 14:47.468
OH, COME ON, YOU GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME. I'M SERIOUS.

14:47.536 --> 14:48.969
LOOK AT THIS THING.
IT'S FULL OF BIG WORDS.

14:49.037 --> 14:50.805
"LITIGATION,"

14:50.872 --> 14:53.774
"FACADE," "CONSTANTINE."

14:53.842 --> 14:56.260
THAT'S THE DEFENDANT'S
LAST NAME.

14:56.328 --> 14:58.029
OK, YOU'RE
BEING AN IMBECILE.

14:58.096 --> 14:59.496
ALL RIGHT, WELL, IF YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY IMBECILES ON YOUR JURY,

14:59.564 --> 15:01.681
I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

15:01.749 --> 15:04.568
OH, THE JURY'S GONNA
BE FULL OF IMBECILES.

15:04.636 --> 15:07.972
THE SMART PEOPLE
GET OUT OF JURY DUTY.

15:08.039 --> 15:11.308
NOW I HAVE TO DO THIS
WHOLE REPORT OVER AGAIN.

15:11.375 --> 15:13.110
OH, GOSH. I'LL
WALK YOU UPSTAIRS, BABY.

15:17.615 --> 15:20.667
HERE WE GO.
THERE YOU ARE.

15:20.735 --> 15:22.336
HEY, AND IF YOU GET
A LITTLE STRESSED OUT,

15:25.156 --> 15:26.606
YOU JUST
GIVE ME A HOLLER.

15:29.810 --> 15:31.828
SO, ANYWAY, I'M SURE YOU'RE
COMFORTABLE HERE AND ALL,

15:31.896 --> 15:33.664
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU EVER
NEED A CHANGE OF SCENERY,

15:33.731 --> 15:35.666
WE GOT PLENTY OF ROOM
IN OUR APARTMENT.

15:35.733 --> 15:36.700
THAT'S REALLY SWEET
OF YOU. ACTUALLY-

15:36.768 --> 15:38.802
UH, HOL, COULD YOU
GO INTO THE KITCHEN

15:38.870 --> 15:41.505
AND SEE HOW WE'RE DOING
MINI-DONUT-WISE?

15:41.573 --> 15:43.340
OH, I THINK WE
HAVE 2 BOXES LEFT.

15:43.407 --> 15:45.075
THINKING ISN'T KNOWING.

15:45.143 --> 15:47.811
YOU'RE RIGHT.

15:49.514 --> 15:51.749
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOIN'? NOTHIN'.

15:51.816 --> 15:52.399
YOU'RE TRYING TO STEAL
MY DOWNSTAIRS WIFE.

15:52.467 --> 15:54.351
YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE A DOWNSTAIRS!

15:54.419 --> 15:55.503
SO?

15:55.570 --> 15:58.005
SH-SHE'LL BE FUTON WIFE.

15:58.072 --> 15:59.306
LOOK, I'M JUST
LOOKIN' FOR SOMEONE

15:59.374 --> 16:01.642
TO IRON MY SHIRTS
WITHOUT BITCHING ABOUT IT.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.077
LOOK, I'LL SEE YOU
SUNDAY. COME ON.

16:03.145 --> 16:05.212
AND YOU, TOO. LET'S GO.
WHAT DID I DO?

16:05.280 --> 16:07.264
I LOOK AT YOU,
AND I SEE TROUBLE.

16:11.369 --> 16:13.003
AND IF YOU
LOOK OVER HERE,

16:13.071 --> 16:14.604
YOU'LL SEE THIS ONE'S
PERFECT FOR YOU.

16:14.672 --> 16:17.257
IT'S A LOVELY ONE-BEDROOM
WITH A KITCHENETTE.

16:17.325 --> 16:18.408
HEY! IT LOOKS REALLY NICE.

16:18.476 --> 16:19.977
WHAT'S, UH-
WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE?

16:20.045 --> 16:21.078

SOME APARTMENTS.

16:21.146 --> 16:24.148
OH, AND WE DO HAVE 2
BOXES OF MINI-DONUTS LEFT.

16:24.216 --> 16:25.715
GREAT, GREAT. UH, COULD
YOU GO INTO THE GARAGE

16:25.783 --> 16:28.702
AND CHECK OUT THE DIET
DR. PEPPER SITUATION?

16:28.769 --> 16:30.420
I THINK WE'VE GOT
ABOUT 4 CASE-

16:30.488 --> 16:32.556
OH. THINKING
ISN'T KNOWING.

16:32.624 --> 16:34.325
HERE,
LET ME GO CHECK.

16:37.028 --> 16:38.862
HEY, GUY.

16:38.930 --> 16:40.231
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO
WANTED HOLLY TO STAY HERE.

16:40.298 --> 16:42.166
WHY ARE YOU
RUSHIN' HER OUT?

16:42.234 --> 16:44.534
THIS ROOMMATE THING'S
NOT FOR ME.

16:44.602 --> 16:46.703
SPITTING OUT OUR TOOTHPASTE
AT THE SAME TIME

16:46.771 --> 16:49.539
WAS ONLY CUTE ONCE.

16:49.607 --> 16:51.374
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
THAT SOUNDS ADORABLE.

16:51.442 --> 16:53.777
HELL, IT'S CUTE ENOUGH
JUST WATCHING YOU DO IT.

16:53.845 --> 16:55.679
SORRY. SHE'S HISTORY.

16:55.747 --> 16:58.515
OK, YOU LISTEN UP AND
YOU LISTEN GOOD, OLD MAN.

16:58.583 --> 17:00.501
I GOT A GOOD THING GOIN'
WITH HOLLY DOWN HERE

17:00.568 --> 17:01.835
AND CARRIE UPSTAIRS, OK?

17:01.902 --> 17:03.970
SO YOU JUST FORGET ABOUT
ALL THIS APARTMENT STUFF.

17:04.038 --> 17:04.905
BUT I WANT HOLLY OUT.

17:05.057 --> 17:06.357
YEAH, WELL, I WANT
HOLLY TO STAY.

17:06.425 --> 17:08.709
I GUESS WE'LL JUST
HAVE TO AGREE TO DISAGREE.

17:08.777 --> 17:10.010
WELL, WHY DON'T WE AGREE
THAT I'M VERY BIG

17:10.078 --> 17:12.046
AND YOU'RE VERY BRITTLE?

17:13.614 --> 17:15.448
I COULD GET ON BOARD WITH THAT. YEAH.

17:15.516 --> 17:17.917
SO HERE'S HOW IT'S
GONNA GO DOWN-WHOA!

17:17.986 --> 17:20.237
IT'S A LITTLE EARLY FOR
A BREAK, HUH, LITTLE LADY?

17:20.305 --> 17:21.271
OH, I'M JUST GONNA
GET SOME COFFEE.

17:21.339 --> 17:22.539
OH, I'LL MAKE YOU
COFFEE.

17:22.607 --> 17:23.540
THAT'S
WHAT I'M HERE FOR.

17:23.608 --> 17:25.040
YOU GO GET BACK
UP IN THAT ZONE.

17:25.108 --> 17:26.175
GET IN THE ZONE, GIRL!

17:26.243 --> 17:27.478

<i>AND THE SEABISCUIT DVD
WITH EXTRAS.</i>

17:39.474 --> 17:41.041
YOU'RE ALL SET HERE.

17:41.976 --> 17:43.994

17:44.061 --> 17:45.846
HEY, THANK YOU

17:49.017 --> 17:49.950
WHAT ARE YOU-
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:50.018 --> 17:50.951
I'M JUST SEEING
IF THE DOOR CAN LOCK

17:51.019 --> 17:52.219
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

17:53.788 --> 17:55.505
WHY WOULD THE DOOR LOCK
FROM THE OUTSIDE?

17:55.573 --> 17:56.306
I KNOW. IT'S CRAZY.

17:56.374 --> 17:58.224
OK, BE PRODUCTIVE!

17:59.310 --> 18:01.395
OH, HOW DID
THOSE MORMONS DO IT?

18:10.855 --> 18:14.891
BOY, YOUR DOWNSTAIRS WIFE REALLY
KNOWS HER WAY AROUND A CHIMICHANGA.

18:15.944 --> 18:17.595
TEQUILA SHOTS, BOYS!

18:17.662 --> 18:19.663
OHH!

18:19.731 --> 18:21.665
I JUST LOVE
THE SMELL OF CIGARS.

18:21.733 --> 18:23.567

JUST MAKES ME WANNA BAKE.

18:25.003 --> 18:27.137
DOUG, GREAT PARTY.
OH, THANKS, MAN.

18:27.205 --> 18:28.705
I WANNA INTRODUCE YOU

18:28.773 --> 18:30.640
HI. THANKS
FOR HAVING ME.

18:30.708 --> 18:31.992
IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO WITH
YOU HAVING TO GO THROUGH LIFE

18:32.060 --> 18:33.360
WITH THIS GUY
AS YOUR BROTHER.

18:33.427 --> 18:35.245
AH, WATCH IT. YOU WANNA
STAY ON MELINDA'S GOOD SIDE.

18:35.313 --> 18:37.247
SHE DOES P.R.

18:37.315 --> 18:39.116

19:04.659 --> 19:06.660
AND I'LL INTRODUCE YOU

19:06.728 --> 19:08.061
'KAY.

19:10.365 --> 19:11.798

19:27.515 --> 19:30.084
WELL, I MEAN, IF SHE'S GONNA
INTRODUCE YOU TO THE PLAYERS,

19:30.151 --> 19:32.353

19:32.420 --> 19:34.688
NO, NO, DON'T WORRY

OK. BYE.

OH, NO, NO, IT'S FINE,

19:50.672 --> 19:52.389
EXCEPT I SPENT ALL DAY
MAKING DOUG'S FAVORITE DISHES,

19:52.457 --> 19:53.523
AND NOW THEY'RE JUST
GONNA SIT HERE AND GET COLD,

19:53.558 --> 19:55.225
BUT DOES HE CARE? NO, NO!

19:55.293 --> 19:57.761
BECAUSE HE'S WITH SOME GIRL
AT HIS PRECIOUS HOCKEY GAME!

20:00.531 --> 20:04.201
SHOULDN'T I BE THE ONE
WHO'S UPSET ABOUT THIS?

20:04.269 --> 20:06.337

20:19.517 --> 20:21.986
HEY, HOL,

20:51.882 --> 20:54.234
OK, I'M GONNA
GO CHECK INTO A HOTEL.

21:02.309 --> 21:03.744
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T SHOW UP
AT THE GAME, MELINDA.

21:03.812 --> 21:05.579
I- I RAN INTO A THING
HERE AT HOME.

21:07.115 --> 21:09.049
NO, I KNOW YOU WENT TO A LOT OF
TROUBLE, AND I APPRECIATE THAT.

21:09.117 --> 21:12.052
LET ME MAKE IT UP TO YOU. CAN YOU
