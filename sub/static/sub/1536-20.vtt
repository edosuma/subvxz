00:01.000 --> 00:02.047
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.120 --> 00:03.121
Juliette.

00:03.200 --> 00:04.531
I thought for sure
you'd be interested

00:04.600 --> 00:06.170
to know that
Ada/ind is pregnant.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.241
It's yours.

00:07.360 --> 00:09.203
Do you remember
that wild afternoon?

00:09.320 --> 00:10.321
What do you want from me?

00:10.400 --> 00:12.323
I need you to protect me
from Juliette.

00:12.400 --> 00:13.640
You're choosing her
over me.

00:13.720 --> 00:14.721
That's not
what I'm doing.

00:14.800 --> 00:16.210
Then get out of my way.

00:16.280 --> 00:19.204
Nick must have some way of
communicating with his mother, yes?

00:19.280 --> 00:23.968
Wouldn't it be wonderful if Nick was in
mortal danger and needed mummy's help?

00:24.040 --> 00:26.964
There is a way to suppress
the Hexenbiest in her.

00:29.640 --> 00:30.641
No.

00:30.720 --> 00:31.720
Juliette, where are you?

00:31.800 --> 00:34.371
You might want to
stop by Aunt Marie's trailer.

00:34.440 --> 00:35.441
What have you done?

00:45.520 --> 00:49.366
"Catch me when you can..."

00:59.840 --> 01:01.330
Oh, my God.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.004
Unbelievable.

01:35.880 --> 01:38.770
This is not Juliette.
This is...

01:38.840 --> 01:40.365
This is vengeance.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.770
I just can't
beheve it.

01:43.840 --> 01:45.365
Even if she is
a Hexenbiest.

01:49.560 --> 01:54.521
Okay, this is not the kind my
family ever went camping in.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.965
This is where
we start looking.

01:56.040 --> 01:57.280
You've seen all
these in Portland?

01:57.360 --> 02:00.045
I gotta say, man, you've
been living one weird life.

02:01.760 --> 02:02.886
You got an extra
flashlight?

02:02.960 --> 02:03.961
Yeah.

02:04.640 --> 02:05.971
Thank you.

02:06.800 --> 02:09.280
All of these books, the weapons,
everything in this trailer

02:09.360 --> 02:11.522
has been in my family
for generations.

02:27.360 --> 02:29.169
Some of these
don't look too bad.

02:29.240 --> 02:31.641
Oh, no, no, no.
Not the Ogre gun.

02:32.640 --> 02:34.290
Please, not the Ogre gun.

02:48.680 --> 02:50.762
The one you used
to save my life.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.161
It looks okay.

02:54.040 --> 02:57.408
Some of these weapons were built
to survive a lot more than this.

02:59.600 --> 03:02.251
Hey, this book's okay.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.008
I don't know
what'll happen with Juliette.

03:05.120 --> 03:07.168
But don't make
the same mistake I did.

03:07.240 --> 03:09.891
Don't leave
the people you love.

03:10.760 --> 03:12.285
Even if that
puts them in danger.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.169
All I have are
a lot of regrets.

03:14.240 --> 03:16.049
No, you don't owe
anyone an apology.

03:19.160 --> 03:20.730
Yes, I do.

03:20.800 --> 03:23.644
Look, I thought about you

03:24.440 --> 03:27.603
every day
for my entire life.

03:27.680 --> 03:28.806
And having you
back in it,

03:31.200 --> 03:33.000
I don't see how I could
ask for anything more.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.962
I'll come back if I can.

03:44.840 --> 03:47.969
Look, why don't we take
what's left to the Spice Shop?

04:29.320 --> 04:31.480
I don't care what happened
to her or what she's become,

04:31.520 --> 04:33.170
she's crossed the line.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.126
We gonna go after her?

04:35.200 --> 04:37.123
What do you think?

04:56.240 --> 04:58.288
Hey. baby
Hi!

05:01.560 --> 05:02.721
Hey!

05:05.680 --> 05:07.569
I love your new hair.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.120
But it's too damn
cold to be out here.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.520
It's better than guttin'
chickens in Creswell.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.567
Much warmer like this.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.366
Stop it.
There's a car comin'.

05:25.080 --> 05:26.525
You go.
I'll get the next one.

05:26.600 --> 05:27.806
Okay.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.925
- You want a date?
- Get in.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.648
You want a date, sweetie?

05:49.720 --> 05:51.484
You're very pretty.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.050
Not from around here,
are you, baby?

05:53.120 --> 05:54.724
I recently arrived.

05:54.800 --> 05:57.201
Mmm, well,
welcome to Portland.

05:57.280 --> 05:58.441
What you lookin' for?

05:58.520 --> 06:02.525
Something a Kehrseite couldn't handle.
What you really are.

06:02.600 --> 06:07.242
Mmm. You mean
something like this?

06:07.960 --> 06:10.122
Ah, now you're beautiful.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.724
This should be fun.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.086
You got someplace special?

06:15.160 --> 06:17.162
I've got a lovely spot.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.365
Um, where are we going?

06:32.440 --> 06:34.249
I think we should
do it right here.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.167
On the ground?
No, no way.

07:06.640 --> 07:07.926
You don't trust me.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.331
Why should I?

07:09.400 --> 07:11.448
Because I'm just trying
to protect myself

07:11.520 --> 07:13.488
and my baby from being
killed by Juliette.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.846
You've seen
what she is now.

07:14.920 --> 07:16.001
I have.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.760
You think I planned
all of this?

07:18.840 --> 07:19.966
I don't.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.840
Now, how is this suppressant
supposed to work?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.446
I don't know how it works.
I just know that it should.

07:27.160 --> 07:29.288
I wish it was a little
more sure than "should."

07:29.360 --> 07:31.886
It's not like I do this
kind of stuff every day.

07:31.960 --> 07:35.726
You know, I was a perfectly happy
lawyer just minding my own business

07:35.800 --> 07:37.370
before Nick's aunt
came to town.

07:37.960 --> 07:41.123
I really doubt his aunt is responsible
for everything you've done.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.725
That's not
what I'm saying.

07:44.800 --> 07:46.211
Oh, what's the point?

07:46.280 --> 07:47.566
You all hate me anyway.

07:49.400 --> 07:52.961
Even though I did side
with the Resistance

07:53.040 --> 07:56.806
and come back here
with Nick's mom and Diana.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.245
I trusted you,

07:58.800 --> 08:01.406
remember, when I was
staying at your house?

08:01.960 --> 08:04.008
I thought you were
trying to help me.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.842
I don't feel good
about what we did.

08:09.560 --> 08:13.167
But it was necessary
to protect your child.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.401
What's left?

08:16.160 --> 08:18.162
Just my mother.

08:18.240 --> 08:20.049
Okay, when do we get her?

08:20.120 --> 08:22.600
We dig her up tomorrow.

08:28.480 --> 08:30.005
What's all that?

08:30.080 --> 08:31.127
Stuff from the trailer.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.530
The stuff that
wasn't destroyed.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.159
Yeah, we're lucky
there's anything left.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.565
What happened
to the trailer?

08:35.640 --> 08:37.130
Juliette.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.611
She torched it.

08:39.440 --> 08:40.679
Oh, my God.

08:40.760 --> 08:43.081
We're moving everything that
survived into the basement.

08:43.159 --> 08:45.441
If she did that to the trailer,
what's she gonna do to me?

08:45.600 --> 08:46.965
You mean,
besides kill you?

08:48.280 --> 08:49.691
Does anybody know
where Juliette is?

08:49.760 --> 08:50.807
No.

08:52.080 --> 08:53.127
And we need to get
you someplace safe.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.929
You can't stay here tonight.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.526
I can't take her to my house. That's
the first place Juliette will look.

08:57.640 --> 08:59.130
Well, my place
would be the second.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.282
There's no way she's
staying at our place.

09:01.360 --> 09:02.646
Sorry, I mean,
same problem.

09:03.280 --> 09:06.727
Uh, after eating one of Adalind's
cookies and devouring half my carpet,

09:06.800 --> 09:09.280
I'm not all that keen,
but whatever you guys need.

09:10.120 --> 09:12.009
Where's the last place
Juliette would look?

09:18.560 --> 09:20.324
I got the blinds down,
curtains drawn,

09:20.400 --> 09:21.845
back door
double locked.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.211
Bud, this is
Adalind Schade.

09:27.280 --> 09:28.406
Adalind, very nice
to meet you.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.720
Any friend of Nick's
is a friend of mine.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.802
And listen,
this is very important.

09:31.880 --> 09:33.644
Nobody can know
that she is here.

09:33.760 --> 09:35.728
Gotcha.
Not even your wife.

09:35.880 --> 09:37.211
Of course not.

09:37.280 --> 09:38.280
When does she get back?

09:38.320 --> 09:39.731
Uh, a week from Thursday.

09:39.800 --> 09:40.926
She... She and
the kids are visiting

09:41.000 --> 09:42.081
her sister Louise
in Ann Arbor.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.730
So, we're good.

09:46.680 --> 09:49.126
And you're very pregnant.

09:49.680 --> 09:50.966
Which is okay, because,
you know,

09:51.040 --> 09:52.690
I've been there,
done that.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.524
Not that I've been
pregnant, but...

09:54.600 --> 09:56.489
Well, that was
a stupid thing to say.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.887
So, what do you want
need me to do here?

09:59.960 --> 10:01.291
Just keep her inside.

10:01.360 --> 10:02.885
Don't answer the phone
or the door.

10:02.960 --> 10:03.961
Copy that.

10:04.080 --> 10:07.641
Is her husband or, you know,
significant other in trouble, too?

10:07.720 --> 10:09.848
'Cause I have enough room.
The fridge is stocked.

10:10.520 --> 10:11.726
Does he like pie?

10:13.520 --> 10:15.010
Do you like pie?

10:15.640 --> 10:16.846
On, Nick?

10:16.920 --> 10:18.046
Oh, he loves pies.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.851
We're always bringing
pies over to him and...

10:22.040 --> 10:24.884
Hold on a second. I think
you misunderstood me.

10:24.960 --> 10:26.450
She knows
what you meant.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.164
She...

10:28.880 --> 10:30.086
But how did...
How did... How did...

10:30.160 --> 10:31.207
What do you mean?
How did that...

10:31.280 --> 10:32.441
Juliette's gone, Bud.

10:32.520 --> 10:33.521
Whoa.

10:34.080 --> 10:35.605
I can't believe that.

10:36.320 --> 10:37.526
It's complicated.

10:37.840 --> 10:38.841
Oh.

10:40.360 --> 10:41.566
I can see that.

10:41.880 --> 10:44.486
Right now, you just need to
make sure that she's safe.

10:44.560 --> 10:45.800
Yeah, sure, right.
Whatever you need.

10:45.880 --> 10:47.450
And if Juliette
tries to contact you,

10:47.520 --> 10:48.851
don't tell her
anything.

10:48.960 --> 10:50.962
She wants Adalind dead.

10:55.080 --> 10:57.481
Well, yeah, okay. Okay.

10:57.560 --> 10:59.767
I mean, you know,
these things happen, I guess.

11:00.800 --> 11:01.801
Thanks, Bud.

11:05.760 --> 11:07.285
How did it go?

11:07.360 --> 11:09.522
Kelly Burkhardt believes
her son's in danger.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.011
She feeling heroic?

11:11.080 --> 11:12.206
She's on her way.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.362
Did you ask about the child?

11:14.440 --> 11:17.808
No, if I had, she would
have gotten suspicious.

11:17.880 --> 11:18.961
Don't underestimate her.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.923
I don't.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.889
I don't
underestimate you, either.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.530
It's better that way.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.285
I'd prefer you not go.

11:28.360 --> 11:29.521
It's been a long day.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.807
Then you should
get some rest.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.524
Things are happening
very quickly now.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.204
We can't afford
to be out of touch.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.408
You expect me to stay here?

11:38.360 --> 11:39.850
I do.

11:39.920 --> 11:41.285
Your room's right there.

11:41.360 --> 11:44.409
So you don't think
Adalind is coming back?

11:44.480 --> 11:46.881
I don't see
why she would.

11:46.960 --> 11:49.167
Now that Nick knows he's
going to be a Grimm daddy,

11:49.240 --> 11:52.005
I'm sure he's taking
very good care of her.

11:59.040 --> 12:00.690
Been burning some bridges?

12:00.760 --> 12:02.364
A little payback.

12:02.440 --> 12:03.441
Oh.

12:04.840 --> 12:07.241
We're going to
have a lot of that.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.282
Get any rest?

13:11.240 --> 13:12.241
Not much.

13:12.320 --> 13:13.320
Me either.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.725
Guess we're all
in good company.

13:14.800 --> 13:15.847
What have we got?

13:16.680 --> 13:18.444
Mary Ann Casey,
24 years old.

13:18.520 --> 13:20.124
Picked up a few times
for prostitution.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.565
Someone cut her
up pretty good.

13:21.640 --> 13:22.641
Who found the body?

13:22.720 --> 13:26.725
Roommate of the deceased and fellow
entertainer, Heidi McDunnah.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.326
Got her in the
back of my car.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.400
Heidi!

13:30.440 --> 13:32.204
Detectives Griffin
and Burkhardt.

13:33.360 --> 13:34.805
You're the one
who found her?

13:34.880 --> 13:36.211
Mary Ann? Yeah.

13:36.280 --> 13:37.725
Were you two
working last night?

13:37.800 --> 13:38.801
Yes.

13:38.920 --> 13:40.280
When was the last
time you saw her?

13:40.320 --> 13:42.448
Just after midnight.

13:42.520 --> 13:43.681
Was she with someone?

13:43.800 --> 13:45.131
I don't know.
I was busy.

13:46.720 --> 13:48.802
I left her on Couch
and 3rd.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.689
And we usually check in
on each other every hour,

13:50.760 --> 13:55.721
and so, when she didn't come
home, I went looking for her.

13:55.800 --> 13:58.565
And I didn't find
her till this morning.

14:00.720 --> 14:03.849
We were supposed to look out for
each other. And I let her down.

14:11.640 --> 14:13.927
Look, I'm just gonna
cut to the chase.

14:14.040 --> 14:16.771
I'm a Grimm, and I know
you're a Klaustreich.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.564
I don't know what you talking about.
Yeah, you do.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.768
Now, I need to know.
Was Mary Ann a Wesen, too?

14:21.720 --> 14:23.688
She's a Fuchsbau.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.006
She have a boyfriend?

14:25.080 --> 14:26.206
No.

14:26.280 --> 14:27.520
She have a problem
with anybody?

14:27.600 --> 14:29.204
We don't have a pimp,
if that's what you're asking.

14:29.280 --> 14:30.520
Johns giving you
any trouble?

14:30.640 --> 14:31.760
Nothing out of the ordinary.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.802
But you never know
when someone's gonna go off.

14:34.480 --> 14:35.840
I just can't
believe this happened.

14:37.280 --> 14:38.566
I can't believe
that she's dead.

14:38.640 --> 14:39.641
You can let her go.

14:39.720 --> 14:41.768
- Bernard!
- Yes, sir.

14:42.560 --> 14:44.688
This officer will
make sure you get home.

14:45.320 --> 14:47.607
Let's take a look at the
body, see what we've got.

14:47.680 --> 14:50.251
She's Wesen,
so was the vic.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.970
Wesen prostitutes?

14:52.040 --> 14:54.407
My mind's going a lot
of places with this.

14:54.480 --> 14:57.723
Well, if they're Wesen,
maybe the killer is, too.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.165
Lot of blood.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.211
Oh, man.

15:01.560 --> 15:03.164
Throat cut.

15:03.240 --> 15:05.083
With a very sharp instrument.

15:05.640 --> 15:07.051
Maybe the killer isn't Wesen.

15:07.120 --> 15:09.009
Well, that'd be
a nice change of pace.

15:11.720 --> 15:13.210
This is more than just a cut.

15:25.160 --> 15:26.200
You need a minute?

15:27.840 --> 15:28.841
Yeah.

15:31.440 --> 15:33.841
You knew her?

15:33.920 --> 15:35.365
I did.

15:35.840 --> 15:38.320
Hi, Mom, it's me.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.165
I know we never had a
chance to say goodbye

15:41.240 --> 15:43.129
after you
kicked me out.

15:43.200 --> 15:46.761
So, goodbye.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.451
And there are probably a few
things you should know.

15:49.520 --> 15:51.522
I had a baby with Sean.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.123
Can't imagine what
you'd think of that.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.362
I named her Diana.

15:56.440 --> 16:01.128
But that didn't work out so
well because she was stolen

16:01.200 --> 16:04.647
by the Grimm and his
friends, including Sean,

16:04.720 --> 16:09.851
and the Grimm's mother
who, by the way, killed you,

16:09.920 --> 16:12.491
which I guess you do know.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.881
Anyway, uh,

16:14.960 --> 16:18.885
now I'm gonna
have another baby.

16:19.640 --> 16:22.883
You'll never guess who the
father of that one is.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.446
It's Nick, the Grimm.

16:26.760 --> 16:31.482
So, the only reason you're not
rolling over in your grave

16:31.560 --> 16:33.369
is because you're here.

16:34.440 --> 16:36.249
You weren't
the greatest mother,

16:37.960 --> 16:41.601
and I'm sure I wasn't the
greatest daughter.

16:43.080 --> 16:45.447
But I loved you.

16:46.560 --> 16:48.767
And now I need you.

16:49.760 --> 16:56.006
You are gonna help me stop Juliette
from killing me and my baby.

16:56.080 --> 16:59.846
And then I'm gonna
get Diana back,

16:59.920 --> 17:03.845
and I'm gonna raise both of
my children the right way.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.964
So, thanks, Mom,

17:08.040 --> 17:10.566
for being dead when
I needed you the most.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.924
Let's get her
out of here.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.047
According to
Mary Ann's sheet,

17:17.119 --> 17:19.599
she's been picked up for
prostitution and possession.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.045
Last arrest was
three months ago.

17:21.119 --> 17:23.009
First offense, a year
and half before that.

17:23.079 --> 17:24.844
Previous address in Creswell.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.569
What about
known associates?

17:26.640 --> 17:27.686
Any dealers
in there?

17:27.760 --> 17:30.923
Two that I know of. Marcus
Ivon and Clinton Wasco.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.445
Just got the report from the ME.

17:32.520 --> 17:33.681
It says,
"The victim's uterus

17:33.760 --> 17:37.401
"was skillfully removed
with a very sharp blade."

17:37.480 --> 17:38.720
Are we talking scalpel?

17:38.800 --> 17:41.690
A drug dealer with a medical degree?
Probably not.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.808
The wounds indicate that
the killer is left-handed.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.120
Really?

17:46.080 --> 17:47.800
This is starting
to sound a little familiar.

17:48.640 --> 17:50.290
Prostitutes,
left-handed killer,

17:50.360 --> 17:52.044
organs being
surgically removed.

17:52.120 --> 17:53.770
You're thinking
Jack the Ripper?

17:53.840 --> 17:55.360
Well, if I remember
correctly, same MO.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.243
Only difference is, that was
London, and this is Portland.

18:00.400 --> 18:01.401
Here we go.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.926
"London, September 1888.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.570
"Elizabeth Stride's
body was found

18:05.640 --> 18:07.722
"in a dark yard off Berner
Street at 1:00 a.m.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.928
"Her throat had been cut
with a sharp instrument.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.764
"Another victim
named Annie Chapman

18:11.840 --> 18:15.083
"also had her throat cut and uterus
removed by an unknown assailant."

18:15.160 --> 18:16.241
Hmm.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.769
You think this is
a Jack the Ripper wannabe?

18:18.840 --> 18:19.841
Maybe.

18:19.920 --> 18:20.921
You tied this
to any other victims?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.001
Not in Portland.

18:22.120 --> 18:23.281
So far just the one.

18:23.360 --> 18:24.566
We're doing
a five-state search

18:24.640 --> 18:25.766
to see if the
killer's on the move.

18:25.840 --> 18:27.285
There could be
one difference here.

18:27.360 --> 18:28.361
Our victim is Wesen.

18:28.440 --> 18:29.726
Unless Jack's were, too.

18:30.320 --> 18:31.320
Intriguing idea.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.400
No way to find that out
unless you can talk to Jack.

18:33.440 --> 18:36.125
Stay on this. The press will be all
over it if they make a connection.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.281
How much has gone out?

18:37.360 --> 18:38.361
Nothing yet.

18:38.440 --> 18:40.283
Good, let's keep it
that way.

18:44.280 --> 18:48.330
Now, what if those murders back
in the 1800s were Wesen-related?

18:48.400 --> 18:50.767
Jack didn't pick his victims
because they were prostitutes.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.683
He picked them because
they were Wesen.

18:52.760 --> 18:55.127
Yeah, sounds like Jack the
Ripper could've been a Grimm.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.520
Except for leaving
their heads on.

18:56.560 --> 18:57.846
I wish we had the trailer.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.604
Well, not everything was destroyed.
We might get lucky.

18:59.680 --> 19:00.966
Then let's go.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.729
I can't do it.

19:08.800 --> 19:09.801
I know I need to.

19:09.880 --> 19:11.325
But... But I can't.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.640
Monroe.

19:12.720 --> 19:14.290
Me?

19:15.440 --> 19:16.521
I'm vegan.

19:18.040 --> 19:19.326
I'll do it.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.401
Thank you.

19:20.480 --> 19:21.481
Uh-huh.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.160
How much
of her do we need?

19:33.240 --> 19:36.608
Tongue, liver, gallbladder
and four ribs.

19:37.200 --> 19:38.201
All right.

19:39.120 --> 19:41.088
Here's the liver,

19:41.440 --> 19:43.442
oh, and the gallbladder.

19:50.960 --> 19:52.371
Maybe you should sit down.

19:52.440 --> 19:54.010
You don't need to...
I'm fine.

19:54.080 --> 19:55.923
Now for the tongue.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.529
So,

20:10.760 --> 20:12.444
how long does Mom
have to cook?

20:13.160 --> 20:16.801
Um, I'm not really sure, but I think
we'll know it when it's done.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.006
Cool.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.848
Now for the ribs.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.367
Here goes.

20:39.680 --> 20:40.681
Don't worry.

20:40.800 --> 20:43.326
I'll check and see who it
is before I let them in.

20:47.680 --> 20:48.727
You Okay?

20:48.800 --> 20:53.203
Yeah, it's just not
that easy being pregnant,

20:53.280 --> 20:56.602
cutting up your mom, and waiting
for someone to kill you.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.764
Honey,
it's Nick and Hank.

20:59.840 --> 21:01.285
We'll be in the basement.

21:01.360 --> 21:04.443
Look, it's not the trailer, but
there's plenty of room at least.

21:04.520 --> 21:05.806
So, what are we
looking for?

21:05.880 --> 21:07.609
- Serial killers.
- Ah!

21:07.680 --> 21:10.126
That's a nice
change of pace.

21:10.200 --> 21:11.201
Anyone in particular?

21:11.280 --> 21:12.691
Jack the Ripper

21:12.760 --> 21:15.240
or somebody like him.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.609
Hello, love.

21:46.960 --> 21:47.961
What do you want?

21:48.040 --> 21:50.646
I'm looking for
something special.

21:50.720 --> 21:53.200
What a Kehrseite
wouldn't understand.

21:53.280 --> 21:55.362
Something wild.

21:57.720 --> 22:00.041
Just what I had in mind.

22:02.800 --> 22:04.450
Wild costs extra.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.887
You're more
than worth it, love.

22:07.800 --> 22:11.725
Now, my friends call me Jack.

22:11.800 --> 22:13.165
I could be your friend.

22:13.240 --> 22:15.163
Well, I'd like that.

22:15.240 --> 22:16.605
Heidi.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.922
Do I know you?

22:21.040 --> 22:23.327
I've been watching you.

22:23.440 --> 22:26.364
And you've been talking to the police...

22:26.440 --> 22:27.680
...haven't you, love?

22:42.160 --> 22:43.491
Wait a minute.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.040
I think I might actually
have something here.

22:46.440 --> 22:50.047
This is from the Luxembourg
Peasant's Revolt of 1798.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.849
Check this out.

22:51.920 --> 22:54.491
"During the chaos
of the bloody conflict,

22:54.600 --> 22:56.204
"I continued to patrol
the streets at night,

22:56.280 --> 22:59.568
"where Blutbaden from
the surrounding countryside

22:59.640 --> 23:01.404
"had come to feed
on refugees."

23:02.800 --> 23:05.246
Now, let me
just clarify here,

23:05.360 --> 23:10.810
my family never did the refugee
thing, just for the record.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.882
"Having killed two
Blutbaden in a fortnight,

23:12.960 --> 23:15.804
"I was somewhat
surprised to discover

23:15.880 --> 23:17.848
"several bodies
of young girls

23:17.920 --> 23:20.321
"whom I knew to be Wesen

23:20.400 --> 23:23.483
"with their throats slit
and their stomachs cut open.

23:25.600 --> 23:28.922
"Normally, I would not get
involved in Wesen on Wesen kills,

23:29.000 --> 23:33.801
"but the sheer
brutality made me curious.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.882
"Was this the work
of another Grimm?"

23:37.680 --> 23:38.727
Well, was it?
I don't know.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.689
The rest of the
page is burned off.

23:40.760 --> 23:42.603
Let me see
if there's more.

23:44.120 --> 23:46.441
Uh, "Later,
came upon a soldier

23:46.520 --> 23:50.605
"killing one of the town's prostitutes
and removing various organs.

23:50.680 --> 23:53.001
"For what purpose,
I still do not know,

23:53.080 --> 23:57.927
"for when I cornered
the soldier,

23:58.040 --> 24:00.407
"he did not Woge.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.960
"Yet there was
something in his eyes,

24:03.040 --> 24:06.089
"as if the Devil himself
had taken hold of him.

24:06.160 --> 24:08.970
"At that moment
I knew what I had to do,

24:10.200 --> 24:11.406
"Wesen or not.

24:12.720 --> 24:17.282
"And even as I plunged
my sword into him, he smiled,

24:17.360 --> 24:19.681
"as if death
meant nothing to him."

24:19.760 --> 24:21.410
"Taken hold of him"?

24:21.520 --> 24:24.444
Does this mean
the soldier's the killer?

24:24.520 --> 24:26.522
Or something was making
him do the killings.

24:26.600 --> 24:29.570
You mean, the old "Devil
made me do it" defense?

24:29.640 --> 24:32.883
Come on, that is,
like, a classic Wesen excuse.

24:49.640 --> 24:51.165
That's the last rib.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.526
Okay.

24:55.560 --> 24:58.131
Perfect.

24:59.400 --> 25:00.640
Did you
find anything?

25:00.720 --> 25:03.371
Yeah, and it's
a little unnerving.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.928
Nick thinks the killer
who did the killing

25:07.000 --> 25:08.525
wasn't actually the killer
who did the killing

25:08.600 --> 25:11.444
because the killing was done by a
killer who'd been dead a long time.

25:11.520 --> 25:13.363
Seriously?

25:13.440 --> 25:15.522
According to the books, Jack the
Ripper might have been around

25:15.600 --> 25:17.364
a hell of a lot longer
than anybody thought.

25:19.680 --> 25:20.681
Ooh.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.366
That really does not
smell very good.

25:23.440 --> 25:26.250
I think this has gotta be
almost ready, don't you?

25:26.320 --> 25:28.129
Oh, Nick, she's gonna faint.

25:28.200 --> 25:29.201
Whoa! Adalind!

25:29.280 --> 25:30.486
No, no, I...

25:30.560 --> 25:31.925
You need to lie down.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.480
No, I need to finish
reducing the potion.

25:35.360 --> 25:37.124
No.

25:37.200 --> 25:38.486
You need to stay
right here.

25:38.560 --> 25:39.925
Adalind, I've got this.

25:40.520 --> 25:41.931
Thanks.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.480
Okay. Okay.

25:47.560 --> 25:49.801
I think it's
boiled down by now.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.120
Yeah.

25:54.600 --> 25:55.965
Whoa.

25:56.960 --> 25:58.200
I think it's done.

25:58.280 --> 25:59.361
Did you see
the skull?

25:59.440 --> 26:00.440
Yes.

26:00.480 --> 26:02.289
Then all we
have to do is strain it.

26:09.320 --> 26:12.005
Wu, I'm putting you
on speaker.

26:12.080 --> 26:13.286
Nick, we got another
body, same MO.

26:13.360 --> 26:14.361
Where?

26:14.440 --> 26:16.249
Under the Broadway Bridge
across from Union Station.

26:16.320 --> 26:17.321
We're sealing off the area.

26:17.400 --> 26:19.767
It's the roommate,
the one we talked to.

26:19.840 --> 26:21.490
We're on our way.

26:21.600 --> 26:22.761
You good here?

26:23.240 --> 26:24.890
Loosely speaking.

26:29.080 --> 26:30.320
What?

26:30.440 --> 26:32.249
Nick has got
to be going crazy right now.

26:32.360 --> 26:33.691
Maybe we should
contact Trubel.

26:34.680 --> 26:37.001
That's probably
not a bad idea.

26:37.840 --> 26:39.001
ME's on her way.

26:39.080 --> 26:42.243
But just like her friend, one slice
to the throat, abdomen cut open.

26:42.320 --> 26:46.041
So, it's either the same Jack copycat
or a copycat of the copycat.

26:46.120 --> 26:47.565
What about
the possession thing?

26:47.640 --> 26:49.051
What possession thing?

26:50.560 --> 26:52.130
I've been getting hourly calls
from the mayor's office,

26:52.200 --> 26:54.885
wanting to know what the hell
we're doing about this.

26:55.880 --> 26:56.881
Is it the same?

26:56.960 --> 26:58.291
Yeah.

26:59.320 --> 27:00.765
Do we have any leads?

27:00.840 --> 27:02.126
Nothing we can share
with the press.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.361
Share it with me.

27:03.440 --> 27:05.363
Well, it's possible we're dealing
with something very old.

27:05.440 --> 27:06.646
What kind of something?

27:06.720 --> 27:09.166
Well, first reference is 100
years before Jack the Ripper.

27:09.240 --> 27:10.800
Several similarly
mutilated women.

27:10.840 --> 27:12.729
Killer was supposedly
a soldier.

27:12.800 --> 27:16.009
He was killed, but 100 years
later, the murders started again

27:16.080 --> 27:17.923
and were blamed
on Jack the Ripper.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.970
And everyone that's killed the
same way is blamed on a copycat.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.405
But what if
it's not a copycat?

27:23.720 --> 27:25.643
Well, I'm not taking
that to the press.

27:25.720 --> 27:28.246
Look, whoever is doing
this is flesh and blood.

27:28.320 --> 27:29.321
Find him.

27:31.800 --> 27:35.486
Uh, how are we supposed to book a
killer who's over 300 years old?

27:35.560 --> 27:37.449
We have
to find him first.

27:37.520 --> 27:40.000
I think he's just
getting started.

27:56.920 --> 27:58.524
I think that's
all of it.

27:58.600 --> 27:59.761
Looks like water.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.284
Won't taste like it.

28:04.560 --> 28:05.560
How'd it go?

28:05.600 --> 28:07.568
It's done.

28:07.640 --> 28:08.641
That's it?

28:08.720 --> 28:10.643
Yeah, it's pure now.

28:10.720 --> 28:13.166
Now, all we have to do is
get Juliette to take it.

28:13.240 --> 28:14.240
Oh, that'll be a snap,

28:14.280 --> 28:16.203
'cause, you know, the last time
she took something we gave her,

28:16.280 --> 28:17.520
boy, that worked out
like gangbusters.

28:17.600 --> 28:19.204
And if she thinks Adalind
had anything to do with it,

28:19.280 --> 28:20.281
she'll never take it.

28:20.360 --> 28:21.646
Unless she knows it works.

28:21.760 --> 28:22.727
How are we going
to know that?

28:22.800 --> 28:23.801
It only works
on Hexenbiests.

28:23.880 --> 28:26.042
That's why I'm gonna
take it first.

28:26.120 --> 28:28.009
If it works on me,
it'll work on her.

28:28.080 --> 28:29.923
You can't... Yeah, I
don't have a choice.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.207
And if she stays a
Hexenbiest, I'm dead.

28:32.400 --> 28:33.447
Oh!

28:41.720 --> 28:42.801
Ugh!

28:44.480 --> 28:45.641
God!

28:45.960 --> 28:46.961
How do you feel?

28:48.240 --> 28:50.368
Like I just drank my mother.

28:51.640 --> 28:54.803
How long before we know if this
stuff is, you know, doing anything?

28:54.920 --> 28:57.446
Mmm. Not too long.

28:58.920 --> 29:00.524
I think
I wanna sit down.

29:00.800 --> 29:01.801
Mmm.

29:01.880 --> 29:03.928
Why?
What's going on?

29:04.000 --> 29:06.526
Just...

29:06.640 --> 29:08.688
You better
hold me down.

29:08.760 --> 29:09.761
What?

29:09.840 --> 29:11.365
All of you.

29:11.440 --> 29:13.249
- Just hold me down.
- Okay.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.810
Oh, God, here it comes!

29:22.720 --> 29:24.563
Don't let go!

29:49.360 --> 29:51.169
Monroe, the jar!
Oh, my God!

29:55.880 --> 29:56.881
Whew!

30:14.400 --> 30:15.481
I have a pulse.

30:15.840 --> 30:16.841
Good.

30:18.400 --> 30:19.526
She's warm.

30:30.320 --> 30:31.685
What happened?

30:35.040 --> 30:36.041
Well...

30:37.960 --> 30:39.610
Things got a little intense.

30:39.720 --> 30:41.961
Yeah, they did.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.450
Did I hear somebody scream?

30:45.040 --> 30:46.405
Yeah,
that would be you.

30:46.600 --> 30:47.601
Oh.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.726
That's why
it sounded so close.

30:52.120 --> 30:53.690
- Oh, no, no, no.
- No, no,

30:53.760 --> 30:55.762
I... I need to sit up.

30:57.960 --> 31:01.407
Well, I guess we should
see if it worked.

31:01.480 --> 31:03.562
I think you should
just lie down.

31:03.640 --> 31:04.880
No, Nick.

31:04.960 --> 31:07.531
I need to know if
this made a difference.

31:09.480 --> 31:10.686
You all better stand back,
just in case.

31:10.760 --> 31:13.286
Yes, right.
Stand back.

32:09.120 --> 32:12.329
Well, I... I guess I'm good.

32:16.520 --> 32:19.091
Now, all you need
is Juliette.

32:19.800 --> 32:21.404
Nick's house.

32:21.480 --> 32:24.131
It's a two-storey house.
Two bedrooms upstairs.

32:24.200 --> 32:25.611
A front door and then
a door through the kitchen

32:25.680 --> 32:27.887
and then the garage
is on that side.

32:29.520 --> 32:30.646
And here?

32:31.200 --> 32:33.601
Mr. Stevenson. He works
for the phone company.

32:33.720 --> 32:37.645
He lives alone. His wife died.
His daughter lives in Phoenix.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.480
The Clemens. They're
both in their 70s.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.483
Retired, they've
lived there forever.

32:44.560 --> 32:46.210
They mostly stay at home.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.080
This one?

32:49.160 --> 32:50.366
Peter and Dana Greene.

32:50.440 --> 32:51.680
They moved in
about two years ago.

32:51.760 --> 32:55.082
They have two young boys,
around five and seven.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.406
And here.

32:56.480 --> 32:57.840
Renters. I don't
know who they are.

32:57.880 --> 32:59.564
How many?

32:59.640 --> 33:00.641
Three.

33:01.440 --> 33:05.081
Well, you know
what they say.

33:05.160 --> 33:06.400
Three is a charm.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.244
I've done
a lot of bad things.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.526
But I... I didn't know that
was gonna happen to Juliette.

33:15.560 --> 33:16.561
Get some sleep.

33:19.120 --> 33:20.121
Nick?

33:23.520 --> 33:25.761
When this works for her,

33:25.840 --> 33:27.683
what happens to our baby?

33:28.760 --> 33:31.445
No one's gonna to take him
from you this time.

33:42.880 --> 33:44.245
What happens now?

33:44.320 --> 33:45.321
Keep her here.

33:45.880 --> 33:47.211
Right, right.
I can do that.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.762
But eventually, the wife and kids
are gonna be coming back and...

33:49.880 --> 33:52.008
As soon as it's done, I'll
find some place for her.

33:52.680 --> 33:54.967
Right. Okay.

33:56.240 --> 33:58.083
You think I should just
stick around tonight?

33:58.160 --> 33:59.161
Just in case?

34:05.720 --> 34:06.721
Just in case what?

34:06.800 --> 34:08.130
We don't know,
that's why I'm staying.

34:08.199 --> 34:11.283
Oh, right, right. Yeah, that's
probably a good idea. Just in case.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.925
Get some sleep.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.400
It's Nick.

34:29.040 --> 34:30.280
Pining for you, is he?

34:30.880 --> 34:32.882
I doubt it.

34:32.960 --> 34:34.324
No, no,
no, no, no.

34:34.400 --> 34:36.641
Let him twist
a little more.

34:37.360 --> 34:38.565
Suffering is
good for the soul.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.004
- Hi, you've reached Juliette.
- Leave a message.

34:46.080 --> 34:49.208
Juliette, we need to talk.

34:49.280 --> 34:51.567
It's important. There's
something that can help.

34:52.080 --> 34:53.366
Call me.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.889
At this moment,
there are no suspects.

35:00.960 --> 35:03.042
However, we are putting
the full force

35:03.200 --> 35:06.044
of the department behind this
investigation.

35:06.360 --> 35:07.361
Mr. Mayor.

35:09.720 --> 35:10.960
I want to add that

35:11.040 --> 35:13.646
I have complete
confidence in our police,

35:13.720 --> 35:15.882
that they will quickly
find this killer,

35:15.960 --> 35:18.088
and that they will
bring him to justice.

35:18.160 --> 35:19.605
And rest assured,

35:19.720 --> 35:22.451
lam putting all our resources
behind this investigation.

35:22.520 --> 35:24.284
Is this
a Jack the Ripper copycat?

35:24.360 --> 35:25.964
He's using the same methods?

35:26.040 --> 35:28.042
I mean, have you found any
connections to other victims?

35:28.120 --> 35:29.849
What're you doing
to keep women off the streets?

35:29.920 --> 35:31.001
Jack was left-handed.

35:31.080 --> 35:32.206
Is this guy left-handed?

35:32.240 --> 35:34.083
What... I just want to assure
the citizens of Portland

35:34.160 --> 35:36.527
that the police are
doing everything we can.

35:36.600 --> 35:39.040
Have there been any notes?
Jack the Ripper...

35:56.800 --> 35:58.768
I need to see you right away.

35:58.840 --> 36:00.171
No, no, it can't wait.

36:01.320 --> 36:03.004
But then when?

36:19.920 --> 36:21.524
Sean?

36:21.600 --> 36:22.840
What's wrong?

36:22.920 --> 36:25.287
Something's happening
to me.

36:26.800 --> 36:27.801
You were shot again?

36:27.880 --> 36:30.565
No, this is from
when I was shot before.

36:30.640 --> 36:31.641
It's the same wounds.

36:32.760 --> 36:35.047
They were healed, and then
they just start bleeding.

36:35.120 --> 36:36.531
It's happened over and over.

36:36.600 --> 36:38.090
Has anyone else
seen this?

36:38.160 --> 36:40.003
I went to see a doctor.

36:40.080 --> 36:41.280
I had an MRI,
I had a CAT scan.

36:41.320 --> 36:42.481
They say there's
nothing wrong with me.

36:42.560 --> 36:44.528
But there is
something wrong with me.

36:44.600 --> 36:46.602
Okay. I need you
to sit down.

36:50.840 --> 36:52.490
Have there been
any dreams?

36:54.160 --> 36:55.286
Yeah.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.644
I keep reliving
the moment I was shot.

37:02.240 --> 37:03.844
And then I wake up.

37:03.920 --> 37:05.490
And I...

37:07.640 --> 37:09.847
I have this dream that
something is reaching for me.

37:13.200 --> 37:14.565
And I've had blackouts.

37:16.520 --> 37:17.920
And where are you
when that happens?

37:18.920 --> 37:20.331
I don't know.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.647
I keep waking up in
these strange places.

37:28.160 --> 37:32.210
In a pool, at a fountain,
in my bathtub.

37:32.280 --> 37:33.725
Always around water?

37:33.800 --> 37:36.610
Yeah. I just... I just
don't know how I got there.

37:36.680 --> 37:37.647
Okay, I need you
to calm down.

37:37.720 --> 37:39.802
Look, can you
help me or not?

37:39.880 --> 37:40.881
I don't know.

37:40.960 --> 37:41.960
It's gonna take
some time.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.525
No, I don't have time!

37:43.600 --> 37:46.160
I don't know even know why I came here.
This is a complete waste!

37:46.200 --> 37:47.281
Sean!

37:48.000 --> 37:49.968
I need you to come back!

37:50.680 --> 37:51.761
Right,
this is where we are.

37:51.840 --> 37:53.808
Bodies have been
found here and here.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.609
So, we're gonna need
extra police presence

37:55.680 --> 37:58.331
in all places known for sex
trafficking, all right?

37:58.400 --> 38:00.289
Thank you.
Let's get on with it.

38:00.360 --> 38:02.283
Hi, man, where you been? Things
are heating up around here.

38:02.360 --> 38:04.567
I've tried Juliette
I don't know how many times.

38:05.160 --> 38:06.207
So, you haven't
spoken to her yet?

38:06.280 --> 38:09.523
No. She's done with me. And I'm
not gonna leave another message.

38:09.640 --> 38:11.244
You gonna get that?

38:13.840 --> 38:15.251
Burkhardt.

38:15.320 --> 38:16.560
Nick.

38:16.640 --> 38:17.846
Juliette?

38:19.160 --> 38:21.208
Sorry, it's taken me so long
to get back to you.

38:21.280 --> 38:22.441
I've been really busy.

38:24.480 --> 38:26.005
Juliette, we found
a way to help you.

38:26.080 --> 38:28.651
Help me? Really?

38:28.720 --> 38:29.960
Yeah, we have a suppressant.

38:30.040 --> 38:31.280
A suppressant?

38:31.360 --> 38:33.283
Look, we tested it,
and it will work.

38:33.360 --> 38:34.646
I thought you said
there wasn't a cure.

38:34.720 --> 38:35.846
Rosalee and
Henrietta both said...

38:35.920 --> 38:39.481
I know, but this can help.
Juliette, this will work.

38:39.560 --> 38:41.005
Just come to the Spice Shop.

38:41.080 --> 38:42.241
Monroe and Rosalee and...

38:42.320 --> 38:44.049
And I have found something.

38:46.560 --> 38:47.561
When?

38:49.040 --> 38:50.041
Now?

38:50.720 --> 38:51.721
Okay.

39:22.960 --> 39:24.724
Some say the Devil's dead,

39:24.840 --> 39:27.207
The Devil's dead,
the Devil's dead

39:27.280 --> 39:31.604
Some say the Devil's dead
And buried in Whitechapel

39:31.720 --> 39:35.281
Some say he rose again
Some say he rose again

39:39.640 --> 39:40.641
She's here.

39:45.760 --> 39:46.807
Juliette.

39:46.880 --> 39:48.609
Hey, Monroe.

39:48.680 --> 39:51.968
Rosalee, Hank, Nick.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.404
Anybody else?

39:57.600 --> 39:58.840
Juliette,
we all know this is...

39:59.200 --> 40:04.411
It's a little bit awkward, but,
really, it's for the right reason.

40:04.480 --> 40:05.641
Fixing me?

40:07.320 --> 40:08.367
Yes.

40:10.240 --> 40:12.083
Such good friends.

40:12.560 --> 40:15.404
But how did this happen,
this special medicine?

40:15.480 --> 40:16.891
How did you suddenly
figure it out?

40:16.960 --> 40:17.961
The books.

40:18.600 --> 40:19.601
From the trailer?

40:21.760 --> 40:23.250
I guess I went
a little overboard

40:23.320 --> 40:27.769
when I found out that whore was
pregnant with a little Grimm.

40:30.680 --> 40:32.125
Juliette, this will work.

40:32.240 --> 40:35.005
So, that means you've tried
it on what, a Fuchsbau?

40:35.480 --> 40:36.481
No, a...

40:37.320 --> 40:39.971
A Blutbad?
I doubt it.

40:41.160 --> 40:42.446
Wouldn't that mean
you'd have to try it

40:42.520 --> 40:44.409
on a Hexenbiest to
make sure it works?

40:44.520 --> 40:48.127
Juliette, take it,
and we can...

40:48.200 --> 40:49.929
It's "we" again?

40:50.000 --> 40:53.925
Look, Juliette, we're just trying
to help you get back what you lost.

40:59.640 --> 41:01.085
Just take it.

41:03.520 --> 41:04.885
Please.

41:06.320 --> 41:07.560
Well, all right.

41:07.640 --> 41:09.881
Let's just
get this over with.

41:17.200 --> 41:19.521
Juliette, stop.

41:20.960 --> 41:22.724
Do I look like I
need anybody's help?

41:25.360 --> 41:27.567
No, Juliette, it's all we've got!

41:41.400 --> 41:43.641
When are you all gonna learn
that I like who I am?

41:44.640 --> 41:45.926
Well, we don't.

41:48.280 --> 41:50.328
Well, that's just
too damn bad.

41:52.440 --> 41:54.886
You made me.
Now, get used to it.

41:58.440 --> 41:59.885
Nick.
Oh, my God.

42:02.800 --> 42:03.847
She's doing it.

42:07.760 --> 42:09.410
What're you doing?

42:09.480 --> 42:11.482
- No!
- I've got no control.

42:11.560 --> 42:12.561
Nick!

42:14.640 --> 42:15.801
Let go of the gun!

42:16.360 --> 42:17.725
I can't stop it!
