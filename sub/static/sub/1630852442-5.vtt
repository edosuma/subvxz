00:15.640 --> 00:18.720
How could a real estate agent
rob a bank during a viewing?

00:18.800 --> 00:21.120
That's the smart bit.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.560
She's got the perfect alibi.

00:23.640 --> 00:26.760
<i>You've reached Maria</i>
<i>at Läget real estate agency.</i>

00:27.280 --> 00:29.800
<i>Thanks for your call. I'm afraid I can't--</i>

00:29.880 --> 00:30.720
Hang on.

00:30.800 --> 00:34.640
We know that
eight people left the apartment.

00:34.720 --> 00:36.880
Then it's empty.
There was no one else there.

00:36.960 --> 00:40.400
So the robber must have been
one of the eight people.

00:40.480 --> 00:42.880
She ran into the apartment
wearing the balaclava.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.560
The hostages were released.
She removed the balaclava

00:45.640 --> 00:47.880
and left with them
without anyone noticing.

00:48.560 --> 00:51.040
It's so damn simple.

00:51.120 --> 00:53.600
She's the one with a strong motive.

00:53.680 --> 00:57.240
That's a fact. Now she won't pick up,
even though I've called a thousand times.

00:57.920 --> 01:00.920
You go from one suspect to the next,
always so confident.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.400
She's the only one left. It must be her.

01:03.920 --> 01:06.120
-I don't understand.
-Yes, but…

01:06.640 --> 01:07.920
Estelle Gustavsson.

01:09.760 --> 01:11.360
You asked me to come in today.

01:11.440 --> 01:14.640
Would you mind waiting outside?
We're just finishing here.

01:14.720 --> 01:16.400
Yes, I'm in no hurry.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.880
-Have you thought this through?
-Yes, I have.

01:23.960 --> 01:28.280
-I really think it could be her.
-Okay, so why is the lady here?

01:29.480 --> 01:33.520
There are indications that suggest
that she helped the real estate agent.

01:35.640 --> 01:36.920
What kind of indications?

01:46.040 --> 01:47.120
Estelle Gustavsson.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.480
On my way.

01:54.560 --> 01:57.360
I'm sorry you had to wait.
There's quite a lot going on.

01:57.440 --> 01:58.440
Don't worry.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.040
Please, have a seat.

02:00.560 --> 02:03.080
I'll do my best to answer your questions,

02:03.160 --> 02:05.480
but my memory is not what it used to be.

02:05.560 --> 02:10.000
But you remember going to view
your own apartment as a potential buyer?

02:58.960 --> 03:01.120
Is anyone hungry?

03:01.200 --> 03:02.640
There's food in the freezer.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.160
I mean, there should be some.
There always is.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.320
I'm fine, thank you.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.760
Let me know and I'll take care of it.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.600
You can't smoke in here.

03:18.600 --> 03:19.720
Why not?

03:20.360 --> 03:21.640
Is it because…

03:22.680 --> 03:24.760
Partly that, but this is a viewing.

03:25.360 --> 03:27.640
It's hardly your average viewing.

03:29.280 --> 03:33.880
Look, there's an ashtray.
People must have smoked here before.

03:34.760 --> 03:40.040
And look,
the smoke is drawn up towards the ceiling.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.920
It's a perfect place to smoke.

03:46.320 --> 03:50.080
It can't be easy for you,
being stuck in here, while your husband

03:50.680 --> 03:52.160
is parking the car.

03:52.240 --> 03:56.240
I believe Knut has parked the car by now.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.840
How long have you been married?

03:58.360 --> 04:00.720
Good Lord. Forever.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.320
I think Ro is cheating on me.

04:04.400 --> 04:05.560
Really?

04:06.080 --> 04:07.280
She's completely off.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.480
She doesn't want to buy this apartment.

04:09.560 --> 04:12.200
She sees no future.
She's involved with someone else.

04:12.280 --> 04:13.280
No.

04:13.360 --> 04:14.960
She couldn't do that.

04:15.040 --> 04:16.280
Do you find it shocking?

04:16.360 --> 04:19.120
You don't do that to someone you love.

04:19.640 --> 04:24.000
What would you say
if I told you I had an affair once?

04:26.520 --> 04:28.320
Have you been unfaithful?

04:29.880 --> 04:31.440
Everyone makes mistakes.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.680
It was a neighbor.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.840
He read a lot, like me.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.760
Knut never read anything,

04:39.840 --> 04:43.240
but this neighbor, Klas-Göran,

04:43.320 --> 04:47.800
he was always carrying a book
when I saw him in the elevator.

04:48.840 --> 04:50.880
One day he said,

04:50.960 --> 04:52.840
"I've finished this book."

04:52.920 --> 04:54.920
"I think you should read it."

04:55.520 --> 04:57.240
And that's when you…

04:59.160 --> 05:00.040
Did you?

05:00.560 --> 05:02.600
I lent him a book.

05:02.680 --> 05:05.480
He lent me one, and I lent him one.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.040
And it carried on like that.

05:08.600 --> 05:13.240
But one day when I opened the book
that I'd borrowed from him,

05:13.840 --> 05:17.280
something fell out and onto the floor.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.560
-Okay.
-What was it?

05:19.640 --> 05:22.000
It was the key to his apartment.

05:24.520 --> 05:26.880
Right. So that's when you…

05:27.520 --> 05:28.360
No.

05:30.520 --> 05:32.840
No, I went to my place.

05:33.360 --> 05:37.600
I toyed with the thought of using the key.

05:37.680 --> 05:43.000
Thousands of times
I put the key in his lock,

05:43.080 --> 05:45.040
in my imagination.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.880
-But hang on…
-God!

05:48.440 --> 05:49.760
So you never did it?

05:49.840 --> 05:52.280
I couldn't do that to Knut.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.800
You cheap tramp.

05:57.600 --> 06:00.880
When Knut died, it was six years ago,

06:03.800 --> 06:07.240
Klas-Göran died a few weeks later.

06:10.560 --> 06:13.520
Since then, my life has been very empty.

06:16.880 --> 06:19.080
So Knut has not gone to park the car?

06:20.240 --> 06:23.480
As I said,
I think he's parked the car by now.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.800
But when we talk about these things,

06:27.880 --> 06:29.280
I like a glass of wine.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.920
You see, there's wine in here.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.240
A whole box.

06:36.600 --> 06:37.640
What?

06:39.080 --> 06:39.960
You live here?

06:40.600 --> 06:43.560
-No.
-That's why you know there's wine.

06:43.640 --> 06:46.680
That's why you know
there's food in the freezer,

06:46.760 --> 06:49.320
and that's why you're so happy
to smoke inside.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.320
You unlocked the bathroom with a key.

06:52.080 --> 06:54.080
Okay. Sure.

06:54.920 --> 06:58.960
You're right. I live here.

07:05.280 --> 07:06.440
What was that?

07:06.520 --> 07:08.320
Have you got pets?

07:08.400 --> 07:09.600
No.

07:12.480 --> 07:13.480
God!

07:14.880 --> 07:16.520
I'll get straight to the point.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.840
You have canceled viewings
three times in the last six months.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.520
Why?

07:22.440 --> 07:24.120
I suppose

07:24.640 --> 07:27.760
I have changed my mind at the last minute.

07:27.840 --> 07:31.840
It's not easy selling a place
where you've lived for so long.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.520
But is it the case that

07:36.600 --> 07:41.920
you feel really bad
for Maria Oredsson because of that?

07:42.000 --> 07:46.200
-The real estate agent?
-I think you know what I mean.

07:46.280 --> 07:49.880
I also know that she's heading
for personal bankruptcy. Right?

07:51.120 --> 07:51.960
Oh.

07:52.520 --> 07:54.880
You can stop pretending now.

07:55.520 --> 08:00.200
Is it not the case that you've felt so bad
that you've wanted to help her

08:00.280 --> 08:02.920
by giving her an alibi
on the day of the robbery?

08:03.000 --> 08:07.480
No, that's not true. Why would I do that?

08:11.840 --> 08:13.680
This is the weapon from the robbery.

08:15.480 --> 08:16.600
Do you recognize it?

08:17.760 --> 08:18.600
No.

08:20.880 --> 08:24.720
How come it's got your prints on it, then?

08:26.040 --> 08:27.160
No idea.

08:29.560 --> 08:34.640
Estelle, is it not the case
that you gave her the weapon?

08:34.720 --> 08:36.600
-No.
-Is it your husband's revolver?

08:36.680 --> 08:40.240
Did you lend it to her
to use in the robbery?

08:40.320 --> 08:41.920
Could you answer my question?

08:42.880 --> 08:44.800
-Jack?
-Not now, I'm a bit--

08:44.880 --> 08:46.280
It's regarding the suspect.

08:47.600 --> 08:48.800
Sorry?

08:51.360 --> 08:52.200
Hold on.

08:55.760 --> 08:59.240
Maria Oredsson is on the bus
arriving in three minutes.

08:59.960 --> 09:00.800
Where?

09:00.880 --> 09:02.000
At the bus station.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.400
Please stay here, Estelle. Keep her there.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.960
Maria Oredsson will be here
in three minutes

09:11.040 --> 09:12.600
on the bus from Stockholm.

09:12.680 --> 09:14.400
It could be
our only chance of catching her.

09:17.960 --> 09:19.160
Jack! Wait!

09:31.400 --> 09:32.680
Maria Oredsson?

09:34.000 --> 09:35.720
Has anyone seen Maria Oredsson?

09:35.800 --> 09:39.720
A dark blonde lady with fairly short hair.

09:40.400 --> 09:41.440
Maria Oredsson!

09:42.560 --> 09:43.920
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.200
-Jack, calm down.
-Check the other side of the coach.

09:50.280 --> 09:53.120
-What?
-Go outside and check. She may be here.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.000
On the other side!

10:03.920 --> 10:05.520
-Hi.
-Hello.

10:13.920 --> 10:15.200
-Maria Oredsson?
-Jack!

10:15.880 --> 10:18.000
Hang on. We need to talk about this.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.000
-Let go!
-There's something I have to--

10:20.080 --> 10:22.320
Are you Maria Oredsson,
the real estate agent?

10:22.400 --> 10:23.240
Yeah.

10:23.320 --> 10:25.120
-Why won't you pick up your phone?
-Sorry?

10:28.760 --> 10:31.360
Maria, right now you're under suspicion,

10:31.440 --> 10:34.240
and you have not answered
a single phone call.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.600
I was at a silent retreat.

10:39.920 --> 10:41.280
A silent retreat?

10:42.720 --> 10:45.120
It's wonderful.
You don't speak for a week.

10:45.800 --> 10:46.680
Right.

10:46.760 --> 10:47.920
It frees your thoughts.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.720
So, Maria,

10:52.400 --> 10:57.000
none of the other hostages
have told us anything about you.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.360
It's as if you weren't there.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.480
I see. But I was there.

11:04.800 --> 11:06.200
Look, something moved.

11:06.280 --> 11:08.120
Is it a cat?

11:08.200 --> 11:09.400
I heard coughing.

11:09.480 --> 11:11.200
Me too, but…

11:11.280 --> 11:13.800
-A cat?
-Yes, Estelle was smoking and--

11:13.880 --> 11:16.000
-I don't know.
-What's going on?

11:16.080 --> 11:18.000
There's a cat that's allergic to smoke.

11:18.080 --> 11:21.560
Some creature
has gotten into the wardrobe.

11:21.640 --> 11:24.520
-Have you checked?
-No, it could be dangerous.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.680
Hang on, Roger. What are you doing?

11:26.760 --> 11:30.560
-Roger!
-It could be absolutely anything.

11:30.640 --> 11:33.640
There, kitty cat. I'll give you some food.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.160
-No, Roger!
-What's going on?

11:40.920 --> 11:44.080
-Roger!
-Oh, sorry.

11:44.160 --> 11:47.200
Oh, hello.
Nice to see so many of you here.

11:48.640 --> 11:52.400
Have you had time
to look around the apartment?

11:56.400 --> 11:57.240
In a wardrobe?

11:57.320 --> 12:00.640
I'm not very good at selling.

12:00.720 --> 12:05.680
I'm not very good at this job,
so sometimes I need to get away

12:05.760 --> 12:07.160
and psych myself up.

12:07.240 --> 12:10.160
-What does this have to do with--
-They started screaming.

12:10.240 --> 12:15.920
I got scared and hid.
I climbed up there and hid.

12:17.960 --> 12:20.080
-Okay.
-I'm not very good at hiding.

12:20.160 --> 12:23.880
I chose that place to hide.
Maybe it wasn't a great hiding place.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.120
Okay.

12:26.200 --> 12:30.560
Maria, I have checked your finances.

12:30.640 --> 12:34.040
Both your business
and your private finances.

12:34.120 --> 12:38.120
It doesn't look too bright, really.

12:38.720 --> 12:42.760
Your real estate firm
hasn't sold anything for six months.

12:44.720 --> 12:48.360
Okay. Things are a bit slow at the moment.

12:48.440 --> 12:51.400
Numbers aren't really my thing.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.600
I'm no good with finances.

12:54.680 --> 12:57.000
It's hard to stick to a budget.

12:57.880 --> 12:58.800
I'm not good at it.

12:58.880 --> 13:02.760
I'd say those are clear motives
for robbing a bank.

13:02.840 --> 13:06.000
Was it your idea or Estelle's
to rob the bank?

13:06.800 --> 13:07.680
What do you mean?

13:07.760 --> 13:10.680
When the robbery failed, you ran into me,

13:10.760 --> 13:13.880
fled into the apartment,
and took everyone hostage.

13:13.960 --> 13:14.800
Isn't that true?

13:16.200 --> 13:17.440
What? No.

13:17.520 --> 13:18.360
Hello?

13:20.400 --> 13:23.760
Are we offering
Estelle Gustavsson some food?

13:25.520 --> 13:27.200
Jim Johansson speaking.

13:28.520 --> 13:29.640
Pardon?

13:31.920 --> 13:32.840
I see.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.480
Where?

13:39.560 --> 13:42.600
I'd never be able to rob a bank.

13:42.680 --> 13:46.360
Please explain to me where the robber was
when I entered the apartment.

13:46.440 --> 13:49.200
-It was empty.
-Still in the apartment.

13:49.280 --> 13:51.080
Wrong answer.

13:51.160 --> 13:52.040
Jack.

13:52.640 --> 13:53.920
Not right now, please.

13:54.800 --> 13:55.920
It's Jill.

14:00.760 --> 14:03.720
She's in a bad way. Very bad. Come on.

14:16.240 --> 14:17.400
What did she take?

14:18.400 --> 14:21.240
I don't know. They just said an overdose.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.040
Jim speaking.

14:26.120 --> 14:29.640
<i>Hi.</i> <i>The real estate agent</i>
<i>and the old lady are still here.</i>

14:30.360 --> 14:36.040
Let them go and give the keys back
to Estelle Gustavsson.

14:36.120 --> 14:39.440
-We don't need them anymore.
-No, Dad.

14:39.520 --> 14:42.920
<i>I will see to it immediately.</i>
<i>Ask Jack to drive carefully.</i>

14:43.000 --> 14:45.200
<i>-The roads are icy in Stockholm.</i>
-Okay. Bye.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.360
I don't want to hear any more
about strange theories.

14:50.440 --> 14:51.840
Not a word.

14:52.560 --> 14:53.720
Who's the robber, then?

14:54.640 --> 14:56.280
Not one of them anyway.

14:58.080 --> 15:00.280
Don't you trust me anymore, Dad?

15:04.760 --> 15:06.120
Good. Have you got the bag?

15:08.640 --> 15:10.120
You're free to go.

15:10.720 --> 15:11.560
Thank you.

15:15.720 --> 15:17.480
-Bye.
-Bye.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.120
What did you tell them?

15:24.720 --> 15:27.440
Not much. I'm not very good at interviews.

15:27.520 --> 15:31.920
The main thing is that
we tell them the same thing.

15:32.480 --> 15:36.560
I don't know. My memory isn't very good.

15:36.640 --> 15:39.600
I think
you need to work on your self-esteem.

15:40.680 --> 15:42.440
-Do you think so?
-Yes, I do.

15:43.080 --> 15:43.920
Yes.

15:44.560 --> 15:47.200
You're fine just as you are.

16:32.920 --> 16:35.560
-Take it easy.
-Mind my nose.

16:35.640 --> 16:38.040
-I've broken my nose.
-I'm trying to help you.

16:38.120 --> 16:40.400
Roger, let me see.

16:40.480 --> 16:41.640
What's going on?

16:46.800 --> 16:47.960
What the hell?

16:51.720 --> 16:52.640
What the hell?

16:54.680 --> 16:56.440
We've seen your face now.

16:57.080 --> 16:58.720
You'll have to kill us now.

16:58.800 --> 16:59.800
-No.
-Yes, you do.

16:59.880 --> 17:01.920
If you don't kill us, you're done for.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
Calm down!

17:03.880 --> 17:04.880
Calm down.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.360
Calm down? You sick bastard!

17:08.920 --> 17:11.080
What are you doing?

17:11.160 --> 17:13.600
Help me. Pin her down.

17:13.680 --> 17:16.200
You could have killed my wife, damn it!

17:16.280 --> 17:18.320
You could have killed her.

17:18.400 --> 17:21.600
The gun just went off.
I got really scared myself.

17:26.000 --> 17:26.920
Sorry.

17:28.320 --> 17:31.760
I promise, I won't hurt anyone.

17:32.480 --> 17:35.520
I just wanted my girls.

17:45.520 --> 17:48.720
-Get down!
-I need to get out.

17:50.880 --> 17:52.160
I need to get out!

17:55.160 --> 17:56.920
Get down!

17:58.520 --> 18:00.440
I don't know what to do.

18:01.760 --> 18:05.520
I just wanted
everything to be alright. Sorry.

18:05.600 --> 18:06.960
Let her go.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.880
My girls are my everything.

18:18.160 --> 18:19.960
Let her go.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.880
We want to hear your explanation.

18:56.320 --> 18:57.640
Dad.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.200
Don't speak.

19:05.240 --> 19:07.600
I know you're sorry. Don't speak.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.800
It's gonna be alright.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.400
You'll be home soon.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.120
I promise everything's gonna be fine.

19:20.320 --> 19:21.600
We love you.

19:52.640 --> 19:54.160
So how was she?

19:55.000 --> 19:56.080
Not great.

19:57.720 --> 19:59.520
We'll have to wait and see.

20:00.760 --> 20:02.200
Sure. Let's go.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.000
Aren't you going to say hi?

20:09.920 --> 20:14.560
I'm working early tomorrow, and we have
a long way to go, so we need to leave now.

20:18.400 --> 20:19.240
Okay.

20:34.280 --> 20:36.560
I panicked and ran in here.

20:40.360 --> 20:43.280
I should have given up
at the bank already,

20:44.560 --> 20:47.920
but I needed the money,
otherwise I would have lost custody.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.880
The girls are the only thing
that matters to me.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.000
What do we do now?

20:59.480 --> 21:01.160
Thanks for sharing.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.080
It doesn't change what I've done.

21:06.160 --> 21:10.440
How could you forgive me for this?
It's sick.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.680
No one is perfect, dear.

21:13.840 --> 21:17.440
We need to talk this through properly.

21:17.520 --> 21:19.440
I need some food.

21:19.520 --> 21:22.000
How can you think about food, Ro?

21:22.080 --> 21:23.680
We've been here for hours.

21:24.280 --> 21:25.320
I need food too.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.080
Okay, but where do we get food from?

21:28.160 --> 21:30.280
It's a bit of a tricky one.

21:30.360 --> 21:35.400
In a hostage situation, the police need to
agree to all demands. I know that.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Who wants pizza?

21:41.080 --> 21:42.680
-Yes, please.
-I do.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.160
<i>Liv speaking.</i>

21:55.240 --> 21:57.680
Hi, this is Estelle.

21:57.760 --> 22:01.440
<i>-Hi, Estelle.</i>
-I'm back in the apartment.

22:01.520 --> 22:05.280
You're welcome to move in tomorrow,
if you still want to.

22:05.360 --> 22:09.320
<i>I'm not sure.</i>
<i>I don't think this is gonna work.</i>

22:13.840 --> 22:17.320
Jack, please be quick. I'm exhausted.

22:17.400 --> 22:18.840
I'm gonna check something.

22:20.040 --> 22:21.800
Can't it wait until the morning?

22:21.880 --> 22:25.040
I'm just checking something
from the bank's surveillance camera.

22:25.120 --> 22:26.000
I'll be quick.

22:40.880 --> 22:44.920
I want to check if the real estate agent
has a similar build to the robber.

22:45.520 --> 22:46.520
Jack.

22:47.920 --> 22:51.320
Where is the hard drive
with the surveillance film?

22:52.600 --> 22:54.000
Please stop digging.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.280
Did you take it?

22:57.960 --> 22:58.880
I deleted it.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.080
What the hell?

23:05.120 --> 23:06.400
I deleted it.

23:07.200 --> 23:09.000
You're protecting the robber.

23:09.080 --> 23:10.760
I had to.

23:13.240 --> 23:14.800
Hang on.

23:14.880 --> 23:17.400
So you know who the robber is?

23:20.240 --> 23:21.160
Yes.
