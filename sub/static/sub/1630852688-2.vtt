00:09.959 --> 00:13.880
MONACO, PRINCIPALITY OF MONACO

00:32.080 --> 00:33.199
How beautiful!

00:34.440 --> 00:37.559
Cris says to me,
"Gio, you have the boat in Monaco."

00:37.640 --> 00:40.800
"You can go with the kids.
Maybe you want to go this weekend."

00:42.040 --> 00:43.600
"You can take your friends."

00:45.080 --> 00:47.559
So, well, I said, "Sure, okay."

00:48.120 --> 00:51.000
I sent a text at almost one
in the morning on Thursday.

00:51.800 --> 00:55.120
"Guys," to the Darlings group,
"do you want to do something crazy?"

00:56.080 --> 00:59.160
The Darlings were so up for it,
they got there before I did.

00:59.239 --> 01:01.599
But how insane is it
that we get a WhatsApp at midnight?

01:01.680 --> 01:04.080
"I propose something crazy. Monaco."

01:04.160 --> 01:05.800
And I say,
"Of course, we go to Monaco."

01:05.880 --> 01:10.759
"Today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow.
I'm available to go to Monaco 24/7."

01:10.840 --> 01:13.600
You always have to have your bags ready
with my sister. Honestly.

01:13.680 --> 01:15.320
You never know the surprise.

01:15.399 --> 01:17.759
If you blink, you miss out
on the adventure for sure.

01:17.840 --> 01:18.840
Yes, it's true.

01:18.920 --> 01:20.880
The Darlings team is up for anything.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.600
We're the regulars.

01:23.680 --> 01:24.960
Mamen and Elena,

01:25.040 --> 01:26.520
who I introduced to my sister.

01:26.600 --> 01:30.800
Sofía. She worked with my sister.
Iván did too.

01:30.880 --> 01:33.680
Georgi has been to Formula 1 before,
right?

01:33.759 --> 01:35.800
- With Cris, or no?
- I think so, right?

01:35.880 --> 01:38.440
Yes, last year, they were with-- Greeting…

01:38.520 --> 01:40.800
- Yes, I did see paparazzi.
- Hamilton. His friend.

01:40.880 --> 01:43.920
- They were in Mercedes.
- Exactly. Is this the first time for you?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.440
Man, of course, darling.

01:45.520 --> 01:47.800
These opportunities only come around
once in a lifetime.

01:48.520 --> 01:50.479
You can't have an agenda with Georgina.

01:51.040 --> 01:53.119
I mean, you never know
where you'll wake up,

01:53.199 --> 01:55.559
and where you'll travel to the next day.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.559
- There's a wasp there.
- What?

02:00.640 --> 02:02.199
There's a bee on the bag.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.799
- Did it sting you?
- No.

02:11.920 --> 02:13.519
- Ow!
- Mommy!

02:13.600 --> 02:15.280
They're bees from Monaco!

02:15.360 --> 02:17.640
Shit, they go straight for the gold.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.239
The best thing about going on the yacht

02:21.320 --> 02:22.799
is that everything is set up.

02:23.239 --> 02:24.760
It's our second home.

02:24.840 --> 02:28.760
Sometimes, I don't even take my bag
because we have everything there.

02:31.160 --> 02:32.720
Look at you!

02:33.360 --> 02:35.040
- Mateo! Hello!

02:36.680 --> 02:39.760
My loves! Come, my loves. Prince!

02:40.360 --> 02:42.040
- Hello.
- How are you?

02:42.120 --> 02:43.280
Hello, darling.

02:44.480 --> 02:46.080
- Hello, my love.
- Honey.

02:46.640 --> 02:47.480
Hello.

02:48.040 --> 02:50.560
- Hi, hi, darling.
- How are you, darling?

02:51.600 --> 02:55.040
- If it isn't my life! My little treasure.
- Who's painted her lips?

02:55.120 --> 02:56.000
How are you?

02:56.080 --> 02:57.600
- Mateo.
- How was your trip?

02:57.679 --> 02:59.560
- How was the trip, darling?
- Great.

02:59.640 --> 03:01.320
- Hey, honey.
- Great.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.239
- Mateo.
- Are you tired?

03:04.200 --> 03:07.120
My nieces and nephews are my everything.

03:07.200 --> 03:11.480
They're the best thing in my life.
I see them and, well, I just melt.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.480
Do you like this flower?

03:13.560 --> 03:16.080
- I love this flower.
- I don't. I don't.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.120
- Hey!
- There's… there's a baby.

03:18.760 --> 03:21.000
- You're ugly!
- I won't give you chocolate. What?

03:21.080 --> 03:23.239
- Where's there a baby?
- Show me those nails.

03:23.320 --> 03:24.679
Where is there a baby?

03:25.360 --> 03:27.320
Now that Alana has said there's a baby…

03:27.399 --> 03:29.600
- There's a baby.
- What?

03:29.679 --> 03:31.000
I'm pregnant.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.720
- No!

03:34.239 --> 03:35.080
Excuse me?

03:35.160 --> 03:37.560
- Yes, we're pregnant.
- Congratulations!

03:37.640 --> 03:40.760
I already knew Ivi was pregnant
since the moment she found out.

03:41.560 --> 03:45.440
So, I was like a spectator.
I wanted to see everyone's reactions,

03:45.519 --> 03:49.160
but I wasn't ready because I didn't know
she was going to say it then.

03:49.239 --> 03:50.359
But, yes, I did know.

03:50.440 --> 03:52.920
- Girl!
- Auntie Ivi has a baby inside.

03:53.000 --> 03:53.920
That's amazing!

03:54.000 --> 03:55.640
- That's so good.
- Yes!

03:55.720 --> 03:58.320
- Oh, I get really excited. Yes, darling.
- Amazing.

03:58.399 --> 04:00.679
- Congratulations, lady.
- Thank you.

04:00.760 --> 04:04.600
Imagine the Darlings, already
with the thrill of being in Monaco,

04:04.679 --> 04:05.600
all haggard…

04:05.679 --> 04:07.079
Well, this was news.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.880
- I don't know if it's a girl or a boy…
- Let me see.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.799
- Show me your hands.
- What do you think it is?

04:13.560 --> 04:15.880
- Hmm, it's a girl.
- A girl? It's a girl?

04:15.959 --> 04:18.079
When you ask someone
to show you their hands,

04:18.159 --> 04:21.720
if they do it like this,
the people I've known have had a boy.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.440
When it's like this, it's a girl.

04:23.520 --> 04:24.840
My sister did this.

04:24.920 --> 04:27.760
- So I looked at her and said, "Let's see."
- It's a girl?

04:27.840 --> 04:29.039
It's a girl.

04:29.120 --> 04:32.080
I gave her the Georgiology test.

04:33.800 --> 04:34.720
It's not heavy.

04:35.440 --> 04:38.360
- No, it's also the cleat…
- It's Cris's cleat.

04:39.320 --> 04:40.880
What happens with that?

04:41.720 --> 04:43.800
- No. It's straight.
- Straight.

04:43.880 --> 04:45.080
See? Girl.

04:45.599 --> 04:46.479
Is it a girl?

04:46.560 --> 04:47.479
This is for real.

04:47.560 --> 04:49.240
It's the science of Georgiology.

04:49.320 --> 04:53.320
Yes, Georgiology exists,
and Georgiology works. It's a girl.

04:53.960 --> 04:54.960
I'm going to have a niece.

04:55.039 --> 04:57.039
- Look at them.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.440
As soon as we found out
Ivi was pregnant,

05:02.520 --> 05:04.160
we stopped and put on some music.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.440
Just to celebrate.

05:05.520 --> 05:08.360
Thing is, my daughters celebrate
by dancing.

05:20.520 --> 05:23.360
The "Darlings" idea came
from Georgi always calling us "darling."

05:23.440 --> 05:25.000
- True.
- She calls you darling.

05:25.080 --> 05:27.440
She's such a charmer
so she calls you darling.

05:27.520 --> 05:28.800
"Darling, what are you doing?"

05:28.880 --> 05:31.359
So she would call us all darlings
and it's true.

05:31.440 --> 05:34.640
It's so warm and nice
that in the end we're all darlings.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.359
I can't believe how many years it's been.

05:36.440 --> 05:38.960
And the amount of hours we spent
on buses to get to work.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.640
Which bus? When was this?

05:41.680 --> 05:44.400
When I moved to Madrid,
which is when I met Iván.

05:44.479 --> 05:45.800
You had a lot of free time.

05:45.880 --> 05:49.120
- And you'd cry… you'd cry on the bus.
- Yes, I'd cry a lot.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.760
I'd get lost around Madrid.
It was just awful.

05:52.479 --> 05:55.280
The first person I met
in Madrid was Ivancico.

05:55.359 --> 05:57.080
At Massimo Dutti.

05:57.160 --> 06:00.080
He was studying and working with me
as a store clerk.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.440
When he decided to leave the store,
I got

06:05.240 --> 06:06.599
so sad.

06:06.680 --> 06:08.720
What happened at the subway escalator?

06:08.800 --> 06:12.200
- You inhaled a fart.
- Shut up! Don't tell that.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.000
- My God!
- You have to now.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.120
Tell us!

06:15.200 --> 06:18.400
We were in the subway,
and all of a sudden…

06:18.479 --> 06:20.720
- She has to tell it now.
- We were really new to Madrid.

06:20.799 --> 06:23.359
Of course we had no idea
people could be so mean.

06:23.440 --> 06:25.240
An older man

06:25.880 --> 06:28.720
in front, my sister and me behind.

06:29.440 --> 06:30.440
Suddenly…

06:30.520 --> 06:32.960
- This was the man's butt in my face.
- …and he goes…

06:33.039 --> 06:34.400
And goes, "Fa!"

06:35.080 --> 06:38.359
- No!
- No, hold on. That was the gesture.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.760
- It was pretty intense.
- Fa!

06:39.840 --> 06:41.160
- And my sister--
- I was like this…

06:41.720 --> 06:44.320
This was my sister's hair.

06:44.400 --> 06:47.120
- Offended, the older man turned around--
- You were laughing!

06:47.200 --> 06:48.640
…and started staring at us.

06:49.479 --> 06:51.400
As if it was you on top of it.

06:51.479 --> 06:54.280
- "Sir, get yourself a butt lid."

06:54.359 --> 06:55.359
Unbelievable.

06:56.280 --> 06:58.680
People might think
that she's really serious

06:58.760 --> 07:02.760
or that she's just a poser
but she's a normal girl.

07:03.520 --> 07:07.280
She likes to eat, laugh,
she likes… I don't know

07:07.359 --> 07:09.840
have fun, chat, hang out.

07:11.280 --> 07:14.760
We usually don't talk about this
but people always ask me,

07:14.840 --> 07:17.760
- "But how is Georgina really?"
- Yes, "Who is Gio?"

07:17.840 --> 07:20.280
"Has she changed?"
I always say, "She's still the same."

07:20.359 --> 07:21.960
- I even get goosebumps.
- Yes.

07:22.039 --> 07:23.880
- It's true, she's still the same.
- True.

07:26.320 --> 07:29.039
The thing that makes her really happy
is family.

07:29.120 --> 07:31.400
Spending time with family and her friends,

07:31.479 --> 07:35.239
because she's also a person who forms
a family with her group of friends.

07:35.320 --> 07:36.840
They don't know what they read.

07:36.919 --> 07:40.440
It's true when you're in the public eye,
the whole world thinks that…

07:41.400 --> 07:43.599
- They have the right to…
- …they have the right to comment.

07:43.680 --> 07:44.840
I mean, they can comment,

07:44.919 --> 07:47.200
but it's as if they knew you,
and they don't.

07:47.280 --> 07:48.120
Right.

07:48.200 --> 07:51.640
Everyone thinks they're part of your life.
It's something that really amazes me.

07:51.719 --> 07:53.760
It seems they know more
about our lives sometimes--

07:53.840 --> 07:56.440
But they also don't know much
about us because we…

07:56.520 --> 07:58.000
I mean, at least me…

07:58.080 --> 07:59.880
- I don't open up completely.
- Exactly.

08:00.479 --> 08:02.080
It was hard at the beginning.

08:02.159 --> 08:05.239
I'd get annoyed
not being able to respond, you know?

08:05.320 --> 08:09.599
And say, "Man, people are talking
and I'd like to share my version."

08:09.679 --> 08:11.479
Which I think is also fair, right?

08:12.679 --> 08:15.039
But it doesn't work like that.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.919
Otherwise, you'd spend all your time

08:17.000 --> 08:19.880
trying to quash fake news
and you can't live like that.

08:20.560 --> 08:23.640
Anyway, I let it pass and that's it.

08:24.400 --> 08:27.479
But I have to say,
I don't get many bad critiques.

08:29.520 --> 08:32.559
I remember one time,
the media were saying you were pregnant,

08:32.640 --> 08:34.480
so one day we planned to meet in Madrid.

08:34.559 --> 08:38.000
And I told her, "I thought you were going
to open that door and be pregnant."

08:38.079 --> 08:41.039
Well, my pregnancy of the elephant.
How long has it lasted?

08:41.120 --> 08:42.199
- Four years?
- True.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.160
As long as you love me,
you know, the people I care about,

08:45.240 --> 08:47.560
- nothing else matters.
- You don't worry about that.

08:47.640 --> 08:48.920
Gio is fun,

08:49.000 --> 08:52.120
generous, polite, respectful.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.840
She's family-oriented,

08:55.360 --> 08:57.920
and she's a really,
really, really good friend.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.199
I remember once, when I was coming out
of the Bernabéu, and everyone was going,

09:02.280 --> 09:07.640
"Georgina, Georgina, Georgina, a photo,
a photo, a photo," after watching a game.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.000
"Georgina!" at the cross walk,

09:09.680 --> 09:13.480
and this really crass woman went by
holding a liter of beer in her hand.

09:14.640 --> 09:18.480
"Hey, so much for Georgina?"
"She was just selling bags a moment ago!"

09:20.560 --> 09:21.800
I was about to tell her,

09:21.880 --> 09:24.760
- "But, girl! Girl!"

09:24.839 --> 09:26.640
- That girl--
- I was going to tell her,

09:26.720 --> 09:29.720
"Excuse me,
I used to sell them. Now I buy them."

09:29.800 --> 09:30.920
"Take that."

09:31.000 --> 09:33.800
Being friends with Georgina is the bomb.

09:33.880 --> 09:37.040
I have a normal friendship
because we're always friends,

09:37.120 --> 09:41.079
but she just has the money and capability
that the rest of people don't have.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.800
She's a friend with superpowers.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.480
- Hello, darlings.
- All right.

09:56.560 --> 09:59.199
- Good morning.
- Good morning. How's it going?

09:59.280 --> 10:02.520
I'll make you a coffee the way I like it,
okay? The way I drink it.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.320
I'll make yours a <i>cortado.</i> I know--

10:04.400 --> 10:06.839
Do you wake up looking like that?
Good heavens!

10:06.920 --> 10:08.120
- Well!
- Yes, man.

10:08.199 --> 10:10.720
- Are you saying that for us?
- No! 

10:10.800 --> 10:12.040
My god!

10:12.120 --> 10:14.720
- I slept awful, just wanted to say.
- Yes?

10:14.800 --> 10:17.959
- What else do you need?
- Nothing. I made coffee like I take it.

10:18.040 --> 10:20.800
- Instant with hot water and cold oat milk.
- All right, great.

10:20.880 --> 10:23.720
- Do you want it, um, hot?
- Um, no.

10:23.800 --> 10:27.640
I'll bathe the babies, I'll take a shower,
and we'll go to the Ferrari pits.

10:27.720 --> 10:31.160
They invited me to lunch
with John, the owner of Ferrari.

10:31.720 --> 10:34.360
- The owner of all Ferrari?
- That's classy, baby.

10:34.440 --> 10:37.079
Nothing surprises me anymore,
I have to say.

10:37.160 --> 10:40.520
I mean, that Ferrari guy?
I don't even know who he is, honestly.

10:40.600 --> 10:43.000
So, I mean, I don't care if she meets him.

10:43.079 --> 10:44.800
I'm just being real.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.240
I'll only take Júnior.

10:46.320 --> 10:48.120
- Sofi, will you come with me?
- Yes.

10:48.199 --> 10:51.240
We'll take the pictures, talk to them,
we'll take a look.

10:51.320 --> 10:53.000
We'll wish Ferrari good luck.

10:53.079 --> 10:55.600
- My heart's torn.
- We'll bring them lots of good luck.

10:55.680 --> 10:57.320
Today, I'm going with Ferrari,

10:57.400 --> 10:59.719
but I also really like Mercedes
because of Hamilton.

10:59.800 --> 11:00.640
Okay.

11:00.719 --> 11:02.040
Well, there's also--

11:02.120 --> 11:04.920
- You're good friends with Hamilton, right?
- Yes.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.480
Yes, Cris really likes him.

11:07.400 --> 11:11.000
The first time I went was three years ago
after the Cannes red carpet.

11:11.079 --> 11:13.440
Cristiano was waiting for me in Monaco,

11:13.520 --> 11:15.880
and the Formula 1 races were going on.

11:15.959 --> 11:18.199
We went to the pits with Hamilton.

11:18.280 --> 11:20.560
We had a chance to look at the cars,

11:20.640 --> 11:24.280
breathe the magical atmosphere.
It's really thrilling there.

11:25.320 --> 11:27.839
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

11:27.920 --> 11:28.880
Hi.

11:29.560 --> 11:30.839
I bring a little something.

11:30.920 --> 11:32.199
- Yes!
- Oh!

11:32.280 --> 11:34.000
- Well, well, well…
- From the Darlings.

11:34.079 --> 11:35.520
- Let's see.

11:36.120 --> 11:36.959
Look, a gift.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.959
- Hey, it's for your Mom.
- It's for Mom, okay?

11:39.040 --> 11:40.680
You'll like it but…

11:40.760 --> 11:41.680
What is it?

11:42.719 --> 11:44.280
- A gift!
- Is it for you?

11:45.120 --> 11:47.640
- Yes, my love. It's for Mommy.
- Wow.

11:48.560 --> 11:50.320
- I'll open it for you.
- Okay.

11:51.240 --> 11:52.839
Let's see. Open it.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.920
You can tell Mateo knows
how to open gifts.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.400
- Man, Mateo's an expert at opening gifts.
- All right.

11:58.520 --> 12:01.160
- Oh!
- A thank you gift.

12:01.240 --> 12:03.360
- Be careful, don't drop it.
- No!

12:03.440 --> 12:05.520
- What about me?
- Poor little one.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.199
- It's for everybody.
- Oh, look!

12:08.880 --> 12:10.400
The necklace Mommy wanted.

12:11.880 --> 12:13.240
Wait, wait, Alana, it can break.

12:13.320 --> 12:15.440
After looking forward
for a year and a half!

12:15.520 --> 12:18.719
- A year and a half looking.
- Well, I'll call it Monaco.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.800
- Great!
- Oh, very well.

12:20.880 --> 12:22.520
- Look at that power.

12:22.600 --> 12:23.520
I'll wear it today.

12:24.560 --> 12:26.760
The Darlings gifted me a gold chain

12:26.839 --> 12:29.400
that I'd spent a year
and a half looking for.

12:29.480 --> 12:32.480
My sister was tired of me saying,
"I want one."

12:32.560 --> 12:35.480
I asked my friend Mamen,
who worked at a fine jeweler,

12:35.560 --> 12:36.640
"Help me find one."

12:37.160 --> 12:41.199
And Elena, "If you travel
and you see one, tell me where?"

12:42.160 --> 12:46.079
In the end my sister got a hold of one
and they all gifted it to me.

12:46.160 --> 12:47.880
To more years in Monaco!

12:47.959 --> 12:49.959
- Hey! Easy there.
- Man!

12:50.040 --> 12:51.040
With milk.

12:51.120 --> 12:53.199
With gold chains like these,
I'll bring you all back.

12:53.280 --> 12:56.240
- Let's not overdo it, gorgeous, right?
- With those gifts.

12:56.320 --> 12:58.120
- A little gift as thanks for Monaco.
- Cheers!

12:58.199 --> 13:00.520
- Thank you, darling.
- To all of you.

13:00.599 --> 13:03.560
- Hey!
- There's some for you too.

13:24.839 --> 13:26.400
Queen!

13:27.079 --> 13:29.640
- Queen of the boat!

13:33.120 --> 13:34.920
John Elkann owns Ferrari,

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
and he's a very,
very good friend of Cristiano.

13:38.079 --> 13:41.640
Cristiano admires him,
and he admires Cristiano very much.

13:42.280 --> 13:45.000
He gave us the opportunity
to visit with Cristianito,

13:45.079 --> 13:47.959
and to live those moments of tension
and excitement.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.360
You wouldn't believe the sound.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.800
It's a whole different world.

14:04.079 --> 14:06.040
Parallel to the one we live in.

14:07.800 --> 14:09.640
It was great. I loved it.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.479
There was nobody there.

14:18.040 --> 14:20.880
Nobody, it was just the owner
and his three children,

14:20.959 --> 14:22.079
and a couple.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.880
- Did you see John Elkann?
- Yes, we've been introduced.

14:24.959 --> 14:28.120
They were with the princess,
who's their sister-in-law. I had no idea.

14:28.719 --> 14:31.920
- And with the prince. What's his name?
- Beatrice Borromeo and--

14:32.000 --> 14:33.959
- Beatrice Borromeo.
- And Pierre Casiraghi.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.680
They didn't tell us
they were there either.

14:36.319 --> 14:38.280
- It's his sister-in-law.
- His sister-in-law?

14:39.040 --> 14:40.479
- Ah!
- He says, "My woman."

14:40.560 --> 14:42.520
- Then he says, "My wife."
- Was the prince there?

14:42.599 --> 14:44.079
- Was there?
- Yes, the brother-in-law.

14:44.160 --> 14:47.280
- John Elkann's brother-in-law.
- Andrea and Pierre Casiraghi were there.

14:47.360 --> 14:49.760
So, who's is the prince? Andrea or…

14:50.400 --> 14:52.360
- They're brothers.
- Oh, they're brothers?

14:53.160 --> 14:54.959
But he said, "My sister-in-law's husband."

14:55.040 --> 14:56.760
- Andrea's the oldest.
- He said that to me.

14:58.920 --> 15:01.479
Well, then, I don't know what he must be.

15:02.240 --> 15:05.079
- We'd arranged for you to have a convers--
- Oh, well it's the two princes,

15:05.160 --> 15:09.120
and the princess's husband
who's not-- who's also a prince.

15:09.199 --> 15:11.520
But who are not brothers, but the husband.

15:12.719 --> 15:16.560
Well, that's one confusing family album…
tree. Wow!

15:16.640 --> 15:18.839
- And I'm from Jaca, fucking clueless.
- Yes.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.680
The princess and I, "Hi!"

15:21.760 --> 15:23.800
- Hey!
- Okay, hi! It doesn't even matter.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.560
It just felt weird afterwards.

15:26.640 --> 15:30.280
And we're wearing these caps,
shirts and they're in suits…

15:30.360 --> 15:31.959
And we're here just…

15:32.920 --> 15:35.640
They must have thought,
"Who are these freaks?"

15:41.160 --> 15:42.880
Beatrice, so here it is.

15:42.959 --> 15:45.280
I'm extending an invite for dinner
at my place.

15:51.920 --> 15:54.479
- Yes, downstairs.
- Mommy!

15:55.800 --> 15:58.520
Give Mom a hug. Let's see,
let's see, let's see.

15:58.599 --> 16:00.319
My loves. Beautiful.

16:00.400 --> 16:01.319
Mom!

16:06.240 --> 16:09.359
Like that. Now, here look.
Look at yourself here.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.560
Oh, look, Dad's calling.

16:13.359 --> 16:14.560
Darling.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.319
<i> Hi, baby. How are you?</i>

16:16.400 --> 16:18.079
Fine. We're back.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.359
I went with Cris and Sofía to Ferrari.

16:21.439 --> 16:22.520
<i>How did it go?</i>

16:22.599 --> 16:24.760
Really well. Everything was great.

16:26.199 --> 16:28.880
Um, you could tell
everyone was really nervous.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.520
- <i>Of course.</i>
- There was adrenaline…

16:32.599 --> 16:34.160
- They're about to go out now.
- Hey, Dad.

16:34.839 --> 16:36.640
<i>How does it look? Hey, my love.</i>

16:36.719 --> 16:38.040
- Hey!

16:39.400 --> 16:40.959
Our hearts are torn.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.680
- <i> You do?</i>
- Daddy!

16:45.359 --> 16:46.839
<i> How are you, my loves?</i>

16:48.079 --> 16:50.120
Who puts that on you?

16:50.680 --> 16:51.959
- <i>Hey, beautiful.</i>

16:52.040 --> 16:53.000
Put it on Mom!

16:53.839 --> 16:56.560
When Cristiano and I
have to be apart for work,

16:56.640 --> 16:58.839
particularly him for the selection,

16:58.920 --> 17:00.520
we still miss each other,

17:00.599 --> 17:03.520
but thanks to technology,
I still feel close to him.

17:04.560 --> 17:06.440
We call each other a lot
through FaceTime.

17:06.960 --> 17:10.680
With the kids. While we have lunch,
while we have dinner.

17:10.760 --> 17:12.960
- <i> Hey love, all good?</i>
- Who have we seen?

17:14.200 --> 17:17.640
I've seen Norris, Leclerc and Sainz.

17:19.280 --> 17:21.399
<i> Did you like it?</i>
- It was cool.

17:21.480 --> 17:24.159
- <i>Good.</i>
- They sounded like…

17:25.839 --> 17:27.599
The engines.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.440
Right?

17:29.520 --> 17:31.800
Yes, yes. Are you going to see the race?

17:32.480 --> 17:34.280
<i> Yes, I'll watch it</i>
<i>before I go to sleep.</i>

17:34.800 --> 17:37.560
Okay, okay. Well then, much luck to you.

17:38.240 --> 17:39.640
- Good luck, Dad.
<i>We'll talk.</i>

17:39.720 --> 17:41.600
- All right, kisses.
- Good luck. Bye.

17:41.680 --> 17:43.159
- Bye.
<i>Talk later. Bye.</i>

17:44.440 --> 17:47.880
To me as a mother
she's one of the most important things,

17:47.960 --> 17:51.159
because we have four kids,
so she's the pillar.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.720
Hey, too bad Leclerc went down
to fifth place.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.200
Yes, man, what a shame.

18:02.960 --> 18:05.080
He was first yesterday.
What a bummer for him.

18:05.159 --> 18:07.840
- Yes, they're so fast.
- They really are.

18:07.919 --> 18:08.840
It's incredible.

18:10.640 --> 18:13.159
See? It's impossible to overtake
in this circuit.

18:14.919 --> 18:18.200
When you're on a yacht,
you watch Formula 1

18:18.280 --> 18:20.040
like it's on a screen.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.880
The cars are going by so fast
that you have no time to see

18:23.960 --> 18:25.360
who just went by.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.440
It's incredible.

18:28.520 --> 18:29.600
Look at Sainz.

18:30.240 --> 18:31.440
So fast.

18:31.520 --> 18:33.000
- Yes?
- He's doing good.

18:33.800 --> 18:34.880
He came in second.

18:34.960 --> 18:36.640
Do you want to lay down here, queen?

18:37.440 --> 18:42.560
It's just such an experience filled
with excitement because of the noise,

18:42.640 --> 18:44.240
the speed of the cars.

18:45.360 --> 18:47.679
Ferrari second!

18:48.440 --> 18:50.360
But look! Look! Carlos!

18:50.440 --> 18:52.919
Carlos!

18:53.760 --> 18:56.960
Bravo, Ferrari! Let's go! Spain!

18:57.960 --> 18:59.560
Then the boats start honking.

19:05.040 --> 19:08.560
It's spectacular.
Everyone's in high spirits.

19:09.560 --> 19:13.840
It's amazing what hanging out with friends
and having fun can do for you.

19:17.080 --> 19:20.280
Carlos! Carlos! Carlos!

19:30.640 --> 19:34.240
TURIN, ITALY

19:54.720 --> 19:55.840
Darling.

19:56.840 --> 19:58.000
<i> Hello, darling.</i>

19:58.919 --> 20:00.520
- Can you see me?
- <i>What you doing?</i>

20:01.560 --> 20:03.600
I'm cleaning my bags.

20:04.880 --> 20:06.679
They're covered in fingerprints,

20:07.440 --> 20:09.080
and packing my suitcase.

20:11.240 --> 20:13.000
- <i>Oh!</i>
- Yes, for vacation.

20:13.080 --> 20:16.800
And then a couple of commitments
I have in Madrid. Please.

20:18.159 --> 20:20.360
I've loved fashion from a young age.

20:20.440 --> 20:23.280
I was always checking out
everyone's dresses.

20:23.360 --> 20:27.399
And then, when I got to Madrid,
I started working at Massimo Dutti.

20:27.480 --> 20:28.919
Then, at Gucci,

20:29.000 --> 20:31.560
I began to be more interested in fashion,

20:31.640 --> 20:34.399
live it up more and understand it,
you know?

20:35.480 --> 20:38.520
<i>All right then. That gorgeous</i>
<i>gray blazer you bought with the pants?</i>

20:38.600 --> 20:39.720
Um,

20:40.399 --> 20:42.200
you say the one from Balmain?

20:43.760 --> 20:45.520
- This one?

20:50.240 --> 20:52.720
Wi-Fi in this house is always shit.

20:54.080 --> 20:58.200
So, four routers in the house
and the freaking Wi-Fi never works.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.840
- Darling?
- <i> Hello.</i>

21:04.360 --> 21:07.960
Twenty routers out here
and the phone still cuts off.

21:08.040 --> 21:09.240
<i>Yes?</i>

21:10.000 --> 21:11.240
Really!

21:11.320 --> 21:14.000
<i>You take the technology curse</i>
<i>wherever you go.</i>

21:14.080 --> 21:15.159
Yes.

21:15.720 --> 21:20.280
I'm taking this dress
I bought in Monaco, the pistachio green.

21:20.360 --> 21:21.480
This one.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.040
<i>Let me see.</i>

21:24.320 --> 21:25.440
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

21:25.520 --> 21:27.720
Very summery and sexy.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.240
<i>I love it. Approved.</i>

21:29.320 --> 21:33.120
We call each other lately
because we usually organize the closet.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.040
I'll tell her, "Oh, this one."

21:35.120 --> 21:37.320
"Do you remember the one we bought
I don't know where?"

21:37.399 --> 21:39.560
Look how nice it goes with the yellow bag.

21:40.360 --> 21:42.080
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Gorgeous.

21:42.159 --> 21:45.679
I love Hermès, I love Gucci,
I love Prada. It's so feminine.

21:46.520 --> 21:48.240
Do you like this Prada one? Okay.

21:49.240 --> 21:52.560
I also have its cousin from Prada.
It has a little chain.

21:54.880 --> 21:57.040
- <i>Oh, I like this one better.</i>
- You do?

21:58.000 --> 22:01.200
I love Louis Vuitton,
I love the Inditex group.

22:01.280 --> 22:03.159
I love Decathlon.

22:04.040 --> 22:05.640
I love Nike.

22:05.720 --> 22:08.399
I love Mayoral. I love all brands.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.919
<i>Your first baby Coco. Isn't it?</i>

22:12.000 --> 22:15.040
The first Hermès I ever had.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.080
<i>Ooh!</i>

22:17.159 --> 22:18.840
Cris gave it to me for Christmas.

22:18.919 --> 22:20.439
I was blown away.

22:21.399 --> 22:23.960
But I was blown away more about, well,

22:24.040 --> 22:25.080
the bag!

22:25.600 --> 22:29.640
But also because of how hard it is
to get an Hermès.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.120
All right, shoes.

22:32.200 --> 22:35.000
<i>You definitely have to wear</i>
<i>those pink shoes this summer.</i>

22:35.080 --> 22:36.200
These ones?

22:36.280 --> 22:39.439
- <i>Because they're beautiful.</i>
- I'll take a pair of jeans then, no?

22:39.520 --> 22:42.000
I can't take these shoes
overshadowing the dress.

22:42.080 --> 22:44.080
I'll take all the colors of these I have.

22:44.600 --> 22:49.320
I love sneakers. I love wearing flats,
although I love heels.

22:49.399 --> 22:51.560
I love bags, I love dresses.

22:52.159 --> 22:53.560
I got these new ones.

22:54.320 --> 22:55.159
<i>Wow!</i>

22:55.800 --> 22:56.880
From Le Silla.

22:57.399 --> 22:58.280
By the way,

22:59.399 --> 23:03.439
there was a card in the box for Le Silla

23:04.000 --> 23:06.600
and I realized they put me on it.

23:07.200 --> 23:08.040
Look.

23:09.159 --> 23:11.439
- It's me.
- <i> Is that in Venice?</i>

23:11.520 --> 23:12.880
<i>In Cannes? Where is it?</i>

23:12.960 --> 23:14.800
This was last year in Venice.

23:16.040 --> 23:17.800
- <i>Wow.</i>
- With the black dress.

23:17.880 --> 23:20.399
Yes, the day I met Almodóvar.

23:20.480 --> 23:22.439
I have a very unique style.

23:22.520 --> 23:26.240
They've tried to change
my style many times, wanted me to wear--

23:26.320 --> 23:28.800
But if I don't feel like myself,
I don't wear it.

23:28.880 --> 23:31.120
I don't like to go out there insecure.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.919
<i>Those gorgeous high tops?</i>
<i>The ones I'm in love with?</i>

23:34.000 --> 23:37.200
<i>- You know which ones. The Dior Jordan's?</i>
- These?

23:37.280 --> 23:38.480
<i>Those.</i>

23:40.159 --> 23:43.720
I feel bad wearing them too much.
I want them to last for my babies.

23:45.280 --> 23:46.560
I love this look.

23:49.240 --> 23:51.159
All like this. Looks like a jumpsuit.

23:52.280 --> 23:54.120
With the transparent ones.

23:54.720 --> 23:59.480
I like to mix a five euro track suit
with my expensive bag, for example.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.640
Or with my amazing sneakers.

24:02.280 --> 24:06.200
I love to mix.
And I love jewelry over a tracksuit.

24:06.280 --> 24:09.800
There will be people
who don't understand it, but they will.

24:14.480 --> 24:16.520
I wear my sweats every day.

24:16.600 --> 24:20.840
I love comfort.
I'm very, very practical in that sense.

24:20.919 --> 24:23.960
I like to be comfortable
so I can run out if I have to.

24:26.760 --> 24:29.399
My kids always get me dirty,

24:30.480 --> 24:33.520
and since I'm always riding
in the car to school…

24:34.960 --> 24:39.040
I try. I can't wear a lot of jeans
because of comfort.

24:39.120 --> 24:41.640
In case I have to go on the swings
at the park,

24:41.720 --> 24:45.280
or the slide, kneel,
sit in the garden or wherever.

24:46.560 --> 24:47.520
Hello.

24:50.480 --> 24:51.439
Hello!

24:52.159 --> 24:53.080
My loves.

24:53.640 --> 24:55.000
My loves.

24:55.080 --> 24:57.520
- Hi.
- Hello, Kevin. How are you?

24:59.960 --> 25:03.320
Being a mom means
being worried 24 hours a day.

25:04.240 --> 25:08.240
You're constantly thinking,
"My kids, my kids, my kids."

25:08.320 --> 25:09.919
They mean everything to me.

25:10.919 --> 25:11.760
Let's go.

25:12.560 --> 25:13.600
Let's go eat.

25:13.679 --> 25:16.320
We're going to write down
what you want to eat, okay?

25:16.399 --> 25:18.480
- Come on, let's go.

25:18.560 --> 25:21.000
Don't cry, love. Let's go.

25:21.600 --> 25:24.960
As a girl, I always had
a strong maternal instinct.

25:25.040 --> 25:28.760
I was very maternal.
I always had my Baby Bones.

25:28.840 --> 25:31.760
Before going to school,
I would play with my little kitchen

25:31.840 --> 25:32.880
and the cribs.

25:33.480 --> 25:35.000
And I would leave them ready

25:35.080 --> 25:39.960
so when I'd come back, I'd take them
for a stroll around my minute house.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.080
They were always very well looked after.

25:42.760 --> 25:45.679
- What time did you fall sleep?
- A little bit late.

25:45.760 --> 25:48.199
Well, I heard you moving
like a little mouse.

25:50.679 --> 25:54.800
She's the most protective person,
the most protective mother,

25:54.880 --> 25:57.040
the warmest mother,
the most loving mother.

25:57.760 --> 25:59.880
And they're always on her mind.

25:59.960 --> 26:03.840
She does everything because of,
and for her children.

26:04.840 --> 26:07.520
Boo! Boo! Boo!

26:07.600 --> 26:08.880
How scary.

26:09.880 --> 26:13.280
- Let's go, handsome.
- Mom, don't give him a cup!

26:13.360 --> 26:14.520
- My cup.
- Of course.

26:16.919 --> 26:20.720
Cristianito, the three babies,
Mateo, Alana and Eva,

26:20.800 --> 26:21.840
they're my whole life.

26:21.919 --> 26:23.800
It was something I always dreamed of.

26:23.880 --> 26:26.720
I always thought I would love
to have a big family.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.760
Let's… let's go eat.

26:28.840 --> 26:31.040
- You put it here.
- Yes, let's go.

26:31.120 --> 26:34.320
- Look, I'll show you.
- We'll have some dessert if you behave.

26:34.399 --> 26:36.040
- Did you put sunscreen on?
- Yes.

26:36.120 --> 26:37.840
You open it and you put this on.

26:37.919 --> 26:40.120
I mean, I'm thankful each day
that I have the freedom

26:40.199 --> 26:44.439
of not having to wake up at 7:00,
leave the house and get back by 21:00

26:44.520 --> 26:46.720
like so many moms. Like I used to.

26:46.800 --> 26:49.159
I would leave home at 8:00, 9:00, 10:00.

26:49.240 --> 26:50.960
I would be back by 10:00 at night.

26:51.520 --> 26:55.000
And I have the economic means
that I can stay home with them.

26:55.080 --> 26:58.720
I'm aware that I have the opportunity
to look after the kids myself.

27:00.720 --> 27:01.760
Do you want this?

27:02.520 --> 27:03.600
A bit of sunscreen.

27:07.080 --> 27:12.040
I'm really, really happy
in knowing that she's the ideal person

27:12.120 --> 27:14.520
to give our kids a good upbringing.

27:17.800 --> 27:20.360
And be the most adequate person
to educate them,

27:20.439 --> 27:22.080
love them, care for them.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.760
- Cristiano put too much sunscreen.
- More for the arms.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.439
It's four kids,

27:29.520 --> 27:32.520
three of them are basically toddlers,
three, four years old,

27:33.760 --> 27:36.919
and if you don't have a mother
to support you in that way,

27:37.000 --> 27:39.199
even if you're the best Dad in the world,

27:39.280 --> 27:41.080
I think you end up falling short.

27:43.439 --> 27:46.000
If you don't have a woman like her, well,

27:46.080 --> 27:48.600
it would be completely different,
much harder.

27:48.679 --> 27:50.360
I have no doubt about it.

27:54.399 --> 27:55.480
Don't I look pretty?

27:56.919 --> 27:59.159
- Can I have the Kinder egg?
- You'll cry.

27:59.240 --> 28:00.080
After.

28:01.280 --> 28:04.360
- I don't have it.
- I'm… I'm really hungry.

28:04.439 --> 28:07.000
- I'm… I'm hungry.
- Yes, Mom is too.

28:07.679 --> 28:09.320
It is the same, right?

28:09.399 --> 28:11.560
- I want a Kinder egg.
- No!

28:12.640 --> 28:15.520
When I see them coming out of school
tired and whiny,

28:15.600 --> 28:19.040
I think to myself,
"The journey won't be easy."

28:19.840 --> 28:22.520
At least one will cry, or want my phone.

28:23.880 --> 28:25.919
I'm hungry.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.480
I'm really hungry!

28:29.080 --> 28:30.399
I want some gum.

28:30.480 --> 28:32.840
If you want, I'll give you a gummy bear.

28:34.840 --> 28:37.600
- Yes!

28:39.040 --> 28:41.320
As a mom, I'm very affectionate,

28:41.399 --> 28:43.360
and a bit of a pushover.

28:44.360 --> 28:47.439
My kids can do anything
they want around me.

28:47.520 --> 28:48.600
I love them so much,

28:48.679 --> 28:51.480
that it is impossible for me
to be strict with them.

28:51.560 --> 28:54.080
If your stomach hurts eating pasta,

28:54.159 --> 28:56.280
it also hurts eating ice cream, okay?

28:59.560 --> 29:01.080
- Mom.
- What, love?

29:01.159 --> 29:03.679
Do you like the lemon one,
or do you like yours?

29:04.480 --> 29:05.800
- Mine.
- Hmm.

29:07.080 --> 29:10.800
TURIN, ITALY

29:17.959 --> 29:19.480
INSTYLE
FASHION

29:24.959 --> 29:26.600
I think that's the last one.

29:27.600 --> 29:28.439
With this.

29:31.720 --> 29:34.280
Oh, I'll entertain myself watching ads.

29:34.840 --> 29:35.959
Let's go!

29:36.560 --> 29:39.840
I love living in Turin.
It's very well located.

29:39.919 --> 29:43.600
Everything is close.
If we want some snow, we go to the snow.

29:43.679 --> 29:46.800
If we want a more cosmopolitan day,
we go to Milan.

29:46.879 --> 29:49.560
If we want sea, we go to Savona or Monaco.

29:50.399 --> 29:54.320
Darling, this china for house two,
because we have the white one,

29:54.399 --> 29:59.199
and the one with the gold detail.
Oh, and the zebra one.

30:00.959 --> 30:02.240
So, this one for Madrid.

30:02.320 --> 30:05.240
Staying in Turin
depends on a lot of things.

30:05.320 --> 30:08.280
Among other things,
it depends on Cris, of course.

30:08.360 --> 30:09.760
In that sense, I don't ask for much

30:09.840 --> 30:12.199
because at the end of the day,
I'm happy at home.

30:12.280 --> 30:13.560
I work from home.

30:13.639 --> 30:15.320
I take care of my children.

30:15.399 --> 30:17.879
My children are super happy
wherever we go,

30:17.959 --> 30:20.919
because we have all the resources
to get them into the best schools,

30:21.000 --> 30:23.240
and the best extracurricular activities.

30:23.879 --> 30:26.760
In 2017, when we remodeled Madrid,

30:26.840 --> 30:29.600
- I bought this china from Hermès--
- It's beautiful because the color--

30:29.679 --> 30:31.800
I don't use it a lot
'cause I don't want to wear it out.

30:31.879 --> 30:33.120
It's beautiful.

30:35.520 --> 30:37.399
I like it so much I don't want to…

30:39.320 --> 30:40.399
The clothes are ready.

30:40.480 --> 30:42.240
The vacation stuff is ready.

30:42.840 --> 30:45.600
About the thing to donate?
The china? What's with that?

30:45.679 --> 30:46.959
The winter stuff's in boxes.

30:47.040 --> 30:50.639
And the summer stuff…
I have some in my room but, oh well.

30:51.159 --> 30:53.439
Cris's next stop for now is Turin,

30:53.520 --> 30:57.120
but in summer as much as in winter,
there's always a chance we travel,

30:57.199 --> 30:59.080
because the markets are open.

30:59.159 --> 31:01.399
There are a lot of factors
that have to sync

31:01.480 --> 31:03.720
but I'm happy and open to any change.

31:03.800 --> 31:05.520
Do you know what I've realized?

31:05.600 --> 31:08.800
What do I look for in the places
I move to?

31:09.600 --> 31:11.760
Countryside, horses,

31:12.720 --> 31:16.040
parks for running,
now that I have children, to go with them,

31:16.120 --> 31:18.080
and spend the mornings, the afternoons.

31:18.600 --> 31:21.439
- Sure… yes.
- That's totally my childhood, you know?

31:23.120 --> 31:25.639
I would like to stay a little longer.

31:25.720 --> 31:29.199
I have a really organized life,
and the kids' school.

31:30.560 --> 31:33.760
I've already looked up
the after-school activities for next year.

31:34.879 --> 31:37.040
The house is set
with all of our belongings.

31:37.919 --> 31:40.879
In case I find out soon,
I'll have to go one day.

31:40.959 --> 31:44.000
I'll leave that day and be back
in the evening to look at houses.

31:44.080 --> 31:46.320
When we moved here, we saw this house.

31:46.840 --> 31:49.320
They had just built it. Freshly done.

31:49.959 --> 31:51.639
It was love at first sight.

31:52.560 --> 31:54.480
We had a meeting in Greece.

31:54.560 --> 31:57.159
He signed his new contract with Juventus.

31:57.240 --> 32:00.320
So, well, after a week,
I think, we went to Turin,

32:00.399 --> 32:01.600
signed the contract,

32:02.199 --> 32:05.199
and we took advantage of the trip
to look for houses.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.760
Well, this house was made for us.

32:17.399 --> 32:18.360
Hello.

32:19.159 --> 32:21.520
- <i>Hello, Georgina, how are you?</i>
- Very well, and you?

32:22.240 --> 32:23.399
<i>Very well too.</i>

32:24.080 --> 32:25.159
<i>Lots of stress.</i>

32:25.800 --> 32:28.360
Sure, that's what's good in life.
To have a job.

32:29.639 --> 32:33.959
Well, I wanted to ask you
about an option to spend summer this year.

32:35.639 --> 32:37.320
We don't want to leave Europe.

32:38.040 --> 32:40.639
Okay? We want to stay around here.

32:40.719 --> 32:42.399
Could be Baleares, Spain,

32:43.040 --> 32:45.679
could be Italy, Croatia, Greece,

32:45.760 --> 32:47.360
France, Côte d'Azur.

32:48.520 --> 32:51.000
When we'd go on vacation as a kid,

32:51.520 --> 32:53.399
I remember my mom would take the car

32:53.480 --> 32:56.360
and take us to a house
we had near the beach.

33:00.280 --> 33:03.840
And well, we'd spend the whole day
eating watermelons.

33:04.399 --> 33:06.159
I remember us going to the supermarket,

33:06.240 --> 33:08.919
buying a giant watermelon,
and loaves of bread.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.959
My mother would make a Spanish omelet.

33:11.719 --> 33:15.879
Or we'd stop at a restaurant
near the beach to buy sandwiches.

33:15.959 --> 33:18.560
Well, we'd try to go
where there were fewer people

33:18.639 --> 33:20.240
so we could rest and chill.

33:21.360 --> 33:24.120
And it was very nice. It was great.

33:24.800 --> 33:27.840
<i>Would you prefer a hotel</i>
<i>or a villa for yourselves?</i>

33:27.919 --> 33:28.919
A villa.

33:29.719 --> 33:33.959
So then, you can look to see
if there's a villa with many rooms,

33:34.040 --> 33:35.399
and a private pool.

33:36.840 --> 33:39.879
- <i>Okay.</i>
- A villa with easy access to the dock,

33:39.959 --> 33:41.959
so we have access with a smaller boat.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.439
It should have a pool.

33:45.040 --> 33:47.719
It should have a piece of land
to walk with the kids

33:47.800 --> 33:51.399
and not have to leave the villa
to take them out for a stroll.

33:52.040 --> 33:54.240
It could have some countryside,
if possible.

33:55.240 --> 33:58.080
Now, I can travel
to the best places in the world

33:58.159 --> 33:59.919
without having to worry
about paying for it

34:00.000 --> 34:01.800
or paying installments.

34:02.959 --> 34:05.439
But I still enjoy as much as I used to.

34:07.879 --> 34:10.639
If it doesn't have a gym, that's fine.

34:10.719 --> 34:13.159
We'll see if there's a room
to put in the machines.

34:13.239 --> 34:15.239
- <i> Okay.</i>
- We'll bring the machines.

34:17.280 --> 34:19.280
It has to be very private…

34:20.600 --> 34:23.920
…because they sent me one in Marbella
but it has access.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.639
No-- Yes, it doesn't have direct access
to the beach,

34:26.719 --> 34:28.560
- but they can see us from the beach.
<i>- Okay, yes.</i>

34:28.639 --> 34:31.400
<i>I think we should discard Marbella</i>
<i>in your case,</i>

34:31.480 --> 34:34.280
<i>because, exactly,</i>
<i>it's an issue of privacy.</i>

34:34.360 --> 34:38.000
Last year, we went around the Côte d'Azur
and we stopped at Minorca,

34:38.080 --> 34:41.280
Majorca, then Formentera and Ibiza.

34:41.360 --> 34:43.280
But we stayed just one night in Ibiza

34:43.360 --> 34:45.600
because the paparazzi
wouldn't leave us alone

34:45.679 --> 34:46.799
and we could never rest.

34:47.880 --> 34:52.080
<i>I'm thinking of one in Italy</i>
<i>and another really cool one in Majorca.</i>

34:52.159 --> 34:55.440
All right. Well, send me the house options
and we'll talk.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.400
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Well, thank you so much.

34:57.960 --> 34:59.839
<i>- Thanks, Georgina.</i>
- All right, we'll talk.

34:59.920 --> 35:01.680
<i>- Very well. Kisses, bye.</i>
- Kisses, bye.

35:04.600 --> 35:06.120
Independent villa.

35:12.280 --> 35:14.240
Okay, all set.

35:14.760 --> 35:16.760
- Oh, the dog.

35:16.839 --> 35:20.799
Oh, Toñi, my love, I didn't know
you were behind Mom, my dear.

35:20.880 --> 35:23.880
That you were there.
I stepped on your bum.

35:23.960 --> 35:26.319
- My love.
- Oh, little queen was asleep.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.799
Look! Mommy!

35:47.280 --> 35:49.480
- Careful.
- One.

35:49.560 --> 35:50.839
Toñi!

35:50.920 --> 35:53.600
Doody, doody, doody.

36:00.240 --> 36:02.160
We're like any other family.

36:03.280 --> 36:05.080
We have breakfast together.

36:05.680 --> 36:09.240
Cris goes to training,
I get ready whatever needs to get ready.

36:09.319 --> 36:11.720
If I have to take care of a house,
I'll do that.

36:11.799 --> 36:14.720
A vacation, a trip,
a future career project…

36:16.080 --> 36:17.360
My children.

36:17.440 --> 36:19.600
- Look at Toñi sunbathing.

36:19.680 --> 36:20.560
Come on.

36:21.600 --> 36:23.760
Okay, enough.
Don't do the splits here, Alana.

36:23.839 --> 36:26.600
Do them on the floor. Right, well…

36:27.600 --> 36:30.040
- Beauties, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

36:30.560 --> 36:31.560
My… my clothes!

36:31.640 --> 36:36.240
To me, my home is my temple.
A place to wind down.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.720
I have the peace I need there.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.760
I feel like I have a sense of family.

36:52.880 --> 36:55.920
In company, valued, spoiled, and loved.

36:56.600 --> 36:59.799
Sometimes I think, "Man, I'm so happy."

37:02.200 --> 37:05.680
MADRID, SPAIN

37:08.080 --> 37:10.720
- A kiss. I love you.
- Mommy!

37:10.799 --> 37:14.240
- Give me a kiss, come on.
- No! Where are you going?

37:15.760 --> 37:17.720
- I'm--
- No!

37:18.359 --> 37:20.600
What's going on, hmm?

37:20.680 --> 37:23.359
All right, I'll be back soon.
I'll get a Kinder egg, love.

37:24.359 --> 37:27.240
The Euro Cup is starting
and Portugal is going all in.

37:27.319 --> 37:30.319
- Hello, good morning, Mrs. Georgina.
- Good morning.

37:30.400 --> 37:31.600
Where are we going?

37:31.680 --> 37:33.319
To Budapest, right?

37:34.400 --> 37:37.640
I'm always on edge
but excited about the Euro Cup.

37:38.200 --> 37:41.040
I know it's a really important time
for Cristiano.

37:41.120 --> 37:45.080
He's been preparing for the Euro Cup
since the start of this season.

37:54.280 --> 37:56.040
We have to talk about something.

37:57.319 --> 37:59.400
- Do you remember the party--
- The wedding? The wedding!

37:59.480 --> 38:01.359
- No.

38:02.160 --> 38:04.280
- It's not up to me! I wish!
- A production. In a castle.

38:04.359 --> 38:07.280
They sent you a catalog about it
from a wedding planning business.

38:07.359 --> 38:08.680
- For weddings?
- Yes.

38:09.280 --> 38:12.040
They are always joking about the wedding.
"When's the wedding?"

38:12.560 --> 38:15.960
Ever since Jennifer Lopez put out
that song about the ring for when…

38:16.040 --> 38:18.319
My god, they're always singing it to me.
