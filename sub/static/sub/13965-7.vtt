JOHN:
Previously on Killjoys...

00:03.296 --> 00:04.957
DUTCH: Who’s that
new bartender again?

00:05.047 --> 00:07.333
Sabine.
It's okay to dwant him.

00:07.425 --> 00:08.505
It's when you
don't want someone,

00:08.593 --> 00:10.003
but you don't want
anyone else to have them.

00:10.094 --> 00:12.380
PAWTER: So, what’s
disrupting thought patterns
got to do with the wall?

00:12.471 --> 00:14.883
I don't know, but I found
one of the engineers,
Artura Senbek,

00:14.974 --> 00:16.760
and the word is
she's in Old Town,
hiding out.

00:16.851 --> 00:17.840
I'm meeting her tonight.

00:17.935 --> 00:19.846
KHLYEN: Each time you
receive a red box,

00:19.937 --> 00:21.848
you will have
a duty to perform.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.895
Why was I on Arkyn as a girl?

00:24.233 --> 00:26.019
KHLYEN: It wasn’t you.

00:30.323 --> 00:31.904
(BREATHING UNEVENLY)

00:32.867 --> 00:34.653
No,no,nol

00:35.286 --> 00:36.275
No.

01:14.784 --> 01:15.990
(BOTH PANTING)

01:16.327 --> 01:17.737

01:21.707 --> 01:22.822
Owl

01:23.376 --> 01:24.661
(GASPING) I'm sorry.

01:25.795 --> 01:28.753
Go back to sleep.
Bad dream.

01:29.173 --> 01:30.879
(EXHALES) Another one?

01:31.968 --> 01:33.003
You're the one who thought

01:33.094 --> 01:36.177
talking about Khlyen's plasma
was a good bedtime story.

01:36.847 --> 01:39.179
Now I can't switch
my brain off.
Hey.

01:40.351 --> 01:41.841
This isn't all on you.

01:42.186 --> 01:43.801
Why put so much
pressure on yourself,

01:43.896 --> 01:45.511
like you're the only
one who can solve it?

01:46.565 --> 01:49.693
Because somewhere
deep and scary,
I know that I am.

01:54.282 --> 01:55.692
I got to go.

01:57.118 --> 01:58.733
You're a free man.

02:34.905 --> 02:36.361
I don't know you.
Why would I trust you?

02:36.449 --> 02:39.191
Because I'm a Killjoy,
and because
Old Town needs you to.

02:39.910 --> 02:42.322
I don't need some
outsider telling me
how to help Old Town.

02:42.413 --> 02:43.823
No, you know exactly
how to help,

02:43.914 --> 02:45.950
because you're part of
what screwed Old Town
in the first place.

02:46.584 --> 02:49.747
Your name?
It's all over these
schematics, Ms. Senbek.

02:49.962 --> 02:54.046
I know that you
helped design the wall.
I'm not blaming you.

02:54.425 --> 02:56.165
You worked for The Company,
and you did yourjob.

02:56.260 --> 02:57.466
But let's be honest.

02:57.553 --> 02:58.542
It was a shitjob,

02:58.637 --> 03:00.252
and you did a shitty thing
caging these people in.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.430
I think I've paid
enough for that. Hmm?

03:02.892 --> 03:05.554
Now, see, that's
interesting as hell to me.

03:06.020 --> 03:08.853
You help engineer the wall,
and then they
lock you inside it.

03:08.939 --> 03:09.974
VVhy?

03:10.524 --> 03:13.266
Because I asked too
many stupid questions.

03:14.195 --> 03:16.151
Now you tell me what
this wall is really for,

03:16.238 --> 03:18.365
and I promise,
no one else will
ever know your part.

03:18.449 --> 03:20.531
D'AVIN: Johnny. Upstairs, now.

03:20.618 --> 03:21.858
Hey, just one second.

03:25.623 --> 03:27.079
Shit.

03:33.798 --> 03:36.084
D'AVIN: How is she?
Definitely still alive.

03:38.094 --> 03:41.006
Okay, walk me through this.
What the hells happened?

03:41.097 --> 03:42.928
I don't know.
One minute,
we're having sex,

03:43.015 --> 03:44.755
and then she just...
I don't know!

03:44.850 --> 03:46.010
Well, did you
freak out after sex

03:46.102 --> 03:47.137
and attack her
like with Dutch?

03:47.228 --> 03:49.435
No! No, shejust
Sixed out on me.

03:49.522 --> 03:51.979
Okay, because,
you know,
you're my brother,

03:52.066 --> 03:53.772
and I love you,

03:53.859 --> 03:56.566
but maybe you
should think about
holstering that thing.

03:56.654 --> 03:57.985
Not a good track record.

03:58.072 --> 04:00.939
And by the way,
Sixes don't have dayjobs
as Westie bartenders.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.614
She was obviously
using you.

04:02.701 --> 04:03.690
For what?

04:03.786 --> 04:06.448
Noidea.
What the hells do we
do with her now?

04:06.539 --> 04:08.530
Dutch has to see this.
We got to get her
cleaned up and on Lucy.

04:08.624 --> 04:09.739
How, genius?

04:09.834 --> 04:12.246
There's a room
full of drunken
Westies downstairs.

04:12.336 --> 04:13.837
"Oh, hey, don't mind us,

04:13.921 --> 04:16.537

your sexy bartender. Pip-pip."

(SIGHS)

04:18.217 --> 04:19.206
Hmm.

04:26.392 --> 04:27.848
It's Sabine.
JOHN: Yeah.

04:28.102 --> 04:30.184
It's Sabine in a bag.
Yes.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.015
Johnny, why did you bring me
Sabine in a bag?

04:32.106 --> 04:33.266
Not a lot of
better options.

04:33.357 --> 04:35.598
I think when you're in
"girl-in-bag" territory,

04:35.693 --> 04:37.775
you skipped way the hells
past better choices.

04:39.113 --> 04:41.024
What is going on?
She's a Six.

04:41.365 --> 04:42.525
How do you know?

04:43.701 --> 04:47.660
She showed herself
while we were having sex.

04:48.372 --> 04:49.361
Oh.

04:50.833 --> 04:51.868
(SIGHS)

04:52.918 --> 04:53.907

04:54.753 --> 04:56.038
I'm not great.

(SABINE MOANS)

05:01.135 --> 05:02.500
Why isn't she
attacking us?

05:02.595 --> 05:05.052
l weakened her somehow.
She won't even wake up.

05:05.264 --> 05:06.504
Really?

05:07.433 --> 05:10.049
I take back my bitching.
Well done, Jaqobis.

05:10.936 --> 05:13.769
We finally have
a Level Six
right where we want them.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.638
In the bag.

05:18.861 --> 05:20.397
No? Too much?

How's she looking?

05:45.012 --> 05:46.092
Six'y.

05:46.222 --> 05:49.259

she told me true?

Let's find out.

05:57.900 --> 06:00.232
John, why isn't she healing?
She's a Six.

06:00.319 --> 06:01.479
That's kind of their thing.

06:01.570 --> 06:04.403
Well, it looks like
she leaked a ton
of that green stuff.

06:04.740 --> 06:06.605
Look, in science-y terms...

06:07.493 --> 06:08.482
I think you broke her.

06:08.577 --> 06:12.445
Maybe she had some kind of
crazy allergic reaction to me?

06:12.540 --> 06:14.405
Well, if this is some sort of
anaphylactic coma,

06:14.500 --> 06:16.661
I can try and jolt her out of
it with an epinephrine shot.

06:16.752 --> 06:18.288

I don't believe you can
be convinced, so why
should I bother trying?

Because you're restrained,
and I'm violent.

that I like you.

braid each other's hair,

you're taking
this too personally.

09:43.667 --> 09:44.747
What's going on?

09:45.502 --> 09:47.914
I just don't like
the way she used you.

punch her face parts.

Well, thank you,
but I'm a big boy, and
we have bigger problems.

09:54.261 --> 09:57.094
Like, none of us have
ever interrogated
a Level Six before,

09:57.181 --> 09:58.671
and she just got
out of some damn coma.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.757
If we get this wrong,
we've lost our shot.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.809
So, how do you suggest
we get the answers?

10:06.356 --> 10:08.221
We need a RAC expert.

10:08.317 --> 10:09.272
No.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.486
Someone who has
lots of experience with Sixes.

10:11.612 --> 10:14.604
Don't say it.
Someone with
a fine head of hair.

10:14.782 --> 10:15.771
Ugh!

10:17.034 --> 10:18.023
I hate you.

10:18.577 --> 10:19.566
I hate you more.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.236
Lucy, hail Turin
on a secure line.

10:23.916 --> 10:26.953
TURIN: We are 100%
off the grid here. No RAC.

10:27.044 --> 10:28.784
A small group of
us crazy assholes

10:28.879 --> 10:30.619
trying to get to the bottom
of what Sixes are.

10:30.798 --> 10:31.958
And this is the first time

10:32.049 --> 10:34.506
we've ever captured one
in the Quad,
so it's a big day.

10:34.593 --> 10:35.628
You all get a cookie.

10:35.719 --> 10:36.708
Whee!

10:38.806 --> 10:40.262

Who's your creepy friend?

10:40.349 --> 10:42.135
He's my creepy
interrogator.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.053
I call him Phil.

Best one we got.
Breaking out the fine
china for you people.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.858
See, the thing about
Sixes, the buggers
lookjust like us.

10:53.028 --> 10:56.065
And we can'tjust go
around poking Killjoys
and seeing who heals.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.525
The union would
frown at that.

10:57.616 --> 11:00.028
Ifwe're ever gonna eradicate
Sixes from The Rack,

11:00.160 --> 11:01.741
we got to identify them first.

11:02.913 --> 11:05.404
That's where
D'avin's little girlfriend
comes in.

11:06.750 --> 11:09.082
And if creepy Phil isjust
gonna creepy torture her,

11:09.169 --> 11:10.375
I'd have saved
you the trouble.

11:10.963 --> 11:12.499
No, pain doesn't
break Sixes.

11:12.589 --> 11:16.332
We've come up with a...
Another technique.
Real elegant shit.

11:16.426 --> 11:17.802
Weenie Jaqobis
will like it.

11:18.428 --> 11:19.804
Me?
You.

11:20.430 --> 11:21.556
Pupillometric measurement.

11:21.640 --> 11:22.675
Ooh.

11:24.935 --> 11:26.596
Optical lie detector. Nice.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.177
How does it work?

11:28.272 --> 11:29.762
TURIN: The eyes don't lie.

11:30.774 --> 11:32.389
Photographs of
missing RAC agents

11:32.484 --> 11:34.020
are projected
inside those goggles,

11:34.111 --> 11:36.352
along with an embedded
prompt, "Am I a Six?"

11:36.446 --> 11:38.152
The computer will
register her reactions.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.195
(TURIN SNAPS FINGERS)

11:39.283 --> 11:42.491
Just like that, we got
a starting list of Level Six
agents to target.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.868
Target how?
We don't even know
how to kill them yet.

11:44.955 --> 11:47.071
TURIN: One problem
at a time, big hair.

11:47.791 --> 11:50.498
We got RAC
loyalists working with us
throughout the day.

11:50.586 --> 11:52.076
Once we...

11:53.338 --> 11:54.669
(BREATH ES HEAVILY)

12:00.012 --> 12:01.673
(BOTH GRUNTING)

12:13.108 --> 12:14.518
TURIN: 'Cause I didn't
come here to lose.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.061
Uh... Guys?

12:17.404 --> 12:18.439
That's not good.

12:20.824 --> 12:22.530
Sorry.
JOHN: "Sorry"?

12:23.118 --> 12:26.155
What the shit
kind of Six is she?

12:26.371 --> 12:27.531
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

12:32.920 --> 12:35.332
DUTCH: Hey. Betty Beheaddy.

12:35.672 --> 12:36.832
What is this?

12:37.299 --> 12:40.132
We call it a Dreadnaught.
It's an execution
stick for Sixes.

12:40.218 --> 12:41.719
I thought all
you people healed.

12:41.803 --> 12:42.792
We have limits.

12:42.888 --> 12:45.049
Instant brain death
is a pretty big one.

12:45.474 --> 12:47.760
Look, I promise,
I had to kill him
before he killed me.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.432
He was a Six.
Bullshit.

12:51.355 --> 12:55.519
To keep me from talking.
Just look at him. Please.

12:55.901 --> 12:57.437
(SIGHS)

13:02.824 --> 13:05.440
There's partial
healing on the edges,
and we got plasma.

13:05.661 --> 13:08.073
Creepy Phil was a creepy Six.

13:13.543 --> 13:16.455
Well, congratulations.
You found the mole.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.120
Passed my test.

13:18.215 --> 13:19.751
That wasn't a test.

13:20.550 --> 13:23.383
No. But it'd be
pretty cool if it was.

13:26.181 --> 13:28.467
I got to go dark
for a while. Clean house.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.810
You and your team
are on your own.

13:31.019 --> 13:33.010
You're taking Sabine,
though, right?
Can't do it.

13:33.105 --> 13:35.312
Her people will probably send
the Black Root for her here.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.476
Khlyen mentioned them.
What are they?

13:37.567 --> 13:40.229
They're like a secret
police for the Sixes.

13:40.570 --> 13:43.733
Keep their people in line.
You do not want to meet them.

13:44.074 --> 13:45.234
Protect Sabine.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.156
Keep her talking,
get everything
you can out of her.

13:47.577 --> 13:48.566
And then?

13:48.954 --> 13:51.616
I'm not Khlyen's
biggest fan, but I know this,

13:51.915 --> 13:54.156
he didn't train you to
be weak when it counts.

13:54.751 --> 13:55.911
You might need this.

14:04.845 --> 14:07.086
DUTCH: (ON COMMS) Guys, grab Sabine.
We’re out of here.

14:07.431 --> 14:08.420
(CRYING)

14:08.515 --> 14:09.755
D'AVIN: Why are you crying?

14:10.017 --> 14:11.177
Something's wrong.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.722
I haven't felt a kill
like this in a long time.

14:17.107 --> 14:18.813
What did you do to me?

14:24.906 --> 14:26.237
Detonation collar.

14:26.324 --> 14:28.610
If any of us gives the order,
your head goes boom.

14:29.286 --> 14:30.947
How's that for
sudden brain death?

14:33.623 --> 14:34.783
All yours.

14:38.128 --> 14:39.664
Clean shirt.
Thanks.

14:43.341 --> 14:46.128
Let me guess,
you're good cop now.

14:46.470 --> 14:48.711
No, I'm the guy
you had sex with,

14:48.805 --> 14:51.057
watched you die,
found out you were a Six,

14:51.141 --> 14:54.133
and deserves some answers.

14:54.311 --> 14:56.427
You do. Sorry.

14:57.814 --> 14:59.020
(SIGHS)

14:59.107 --> 15:01.689
So, what do you want to know?

15:03.445 --> 15:05.026
Why were you
getting close to me?

15:05.113 --> 15:07.695
I told you, it was my
assignment from Khlyen.

15:08.450 --> 15:10.281
Watching over you,
keeping you safe.

15:11.787 --> 15:14.324
The rest was
completely your fault
for that incredible jawline.

15:14.539 --> 15:15.574
(SIGHS)

15:15.665 --> 15:17.872
It's okay, you can smile.
lwon't tell her.

15:18.126 --> 15:19.957
(CHUCKLES)
This isn't about Dutch.

15:20.045 --> 15:23.162
Everything you do is
a little bit about her,
don't you think?

15:23.465 --> 15:24.955
Even me.
You?

15:25.050 --> 15:27.883
l was supposed to be
the door closer, right?
The move-on lay.

15:29.387 --> 15:30.763
Sorry I screwed that up.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.013
Still don't regret last night.

15:34.184 --> 15:37.017
Oh, really? How about
the almost dying part?

15:37.562 --> 15:39.268
Yeah, that was less good.

15:39.981 --> 15:42.973
Most people just
fall asleep after.
I had to get all dramatic.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.269
What?

15:52.202 --> 15:53.487
You're bleeding.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.866
She's still bleeding
from the fight.

15:57.958 --> 15:58.947
So?

15:59.209 --> 16:01.541
So,notheaHng,
killing her own people,

16:01.628 --> 16:03.914
she's not exactly
a normal Six anymore.

16:04.005 --> 16:06.621
Maybe Johnny can...
I don't know,
experimentwith me.

16:06.716 --> 16:08.843
Maybe I can heal
her fully somehow.

16:08.927 --> 16:11.259
D'avin, she is playing you.

16:11.346 --> 16:13.553
I know, I'm not being
yanked around by my shaft.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.050
No, by your heart.

16:15.559 --> 16:17.049
Tell me you don't
feel sorry for her.

16:17.144 --> 16:18.384
We should feel
sorry for her.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.810
Bullshit. She's not
some wounded animal

16:20.897 --> 16:22.148
we found by
the side of the road.

16:22.232 --> 16:23.972
You don't get to
fix her and keep her.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.562
She is a weapon
meant to be used against us,

16:26.695 --> 16:29.357
and once we get
what we can out of her,
we're getting rid of her.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.648
What is that
supposed to mean?

16:32.742 --> 16:35.119
What do you think?
No, you say it.

16:36.246 --> 16:39.329
You want to go
back to being Yala?
Red boxes and assassinations?

16:39.416 --> 16:42.249
You're better than that.
We're not murderers.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.666
We are at war.
With who?

16:43.753 --> 16:46.460
I don't know,
because your little
bang buddy won't tell me.

16:46.548 --> 16:47.958
Then treat her like
an enemy combatant.

16:48.049 --> 16:49.914
There are conventions,
and you don't
get to break them.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.924
Find another way.

16:53.638 --> 16:55.754
JOHN: Guys, lthink
I figured out what's
happening to Sabine.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.182
I had Turin send me a scan
of his little headless buddy

16:59.269 --> 17:00.509
for comparison with Sabine.

17:00.604 --> 17:03.767
Not really up on my
brain art, Johnny.
What are we seeing?

17:04.107 --> 17:05.938
(SIGHS) Honestly?
I don't know.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.937
Micro lesions
or neurofungus,

17:08.028 --> 17:10.690
all clustered in
the anterior insular cortex
and hypothalamus...

17:10.780 --> 17:12.862
Smaller words.
It's like an infection.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.405
It shuts down
parts of the brain

17:14.492 --> 17:15.902
that allow for bonding,
empathy, and love.

17:17.245 --> 17:19.281
I think we're looking
at what makes Sixes.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.199
It's like someone
invented a way

17:21.291 --> 17:23.748
to shut down
everything about us
that's human and good.

17:23.835 --> 17:25.621
Engineered psychopaths?
JOHN: Yeah.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.457
But take a look
at the scan of Sabine's
from this morning.

17:28.548 --> 17:29.958
Looks almost normal.

17:30.050 --> 17:32.507
Right now,
without enough of that shit
in her system to control her,

17:32.594 --> 17:34.084
I think we're
seeing the real Sabine.

17:34.179 --> 17:36.966
She's having her
first true emotions
in, what, decades?

17:37.057 --> 17:38.297
VVhy?

17:38.391 --> 17:39.551
You.

17:39.643 --> 17:43.010
When you two hooked up,
and she exploded
out all that plasma,

17:43.104 --> 17:46.096
I think the stuff in her brain
started to die off without it.

17:46.191 --> 17:49.683
So, the cure for
Sixes is banging D'av?

17:50.528 --> 17:52.905
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, well,
as much as I would like
to claim that one

17:52.989 --> 17:54.570
for Clan Jaqobis, no.

17:55.325 --> 17:56.565
Take a look at
this latest scan.

17:57.994 --> 17:59.780
It's coming back.
Fast.

17:59.871 --> 18:02.988
The plasma must have
some base titer or
viral load it returns to.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.243
So, it's temporary.

18:04.334 --> 18:07.417
Until she turns into
a psychopathic Six again.

18:07.504 --> 18:08.664
SABINE: How long do I have?

18:14.719 --> 18:16.220
You must be thrilled
to get rid of me

18:16.304 --> 18:17.680
without having
to be the bad guy.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.345
I'm not afraid of
being the bad guy.

18:19.474 --> 18:21.385
There you go,
making me like you again.

18:21.476 --> 18:23.341
Got to respect
an honest bitch.

18:24.271 --> 18:25.807
Why did they pick you, Sabine?

18:26.273 --> 18:28.013
They track all of us agents.

18:28.525 --> 18:29.731
I had the winning combo.

18:29.818 --> 18:31.604
Strong enough to take
the physical transition,

18:31.695 --> 18:33.026
broken enough to
survive the mental.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.228
How do you mean, "mental"?

18:34.322 --> 18:37.064
Let's just say it's not
a very efficient process.

18:37.701 --> 18:40.283
Most people don't
make it through.
They go crazy.

18:41.538 --> 18:44.280
The green breaks
your bonds with anyone
you've ever loved.

18:44.374 --> 18:47.457
It's like everyone you
had any connection to
dies on you, all at once.

18:47.544 --> 18:50.286
The more damaged and
antisocial you are,
the better a candidate.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.955
Guess I checked
the right boxes.

18:53.675 --> 18:54.790
Like you.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.966
I'm on that list
because Khlyen put me there.

18:57.053 --> 18:59.886
You're on that list
because Khlyen
broke you in the cradle.

19:01.433 --> 19:03.094
It's not fair, you know?

19:03.184 --> 19:05.140
They didn't ask,
they just took
me and did this.

19:05.228 --> 19:06.388
I'm not anybody's puppet.

19:08.064 --> 19:09.270
On that, we agree.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.189
I'm not dying on this ship.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.944
What if I could help you
identify all the Sixes,
everywhere?

19:16.406 --> 19:19.569
One condition.
After, you let me go.

19:19.743 --> 19:21.574
I can't do that.
You know I can't.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.993
My people will track me
down for betraying them.

19:24.748 --> 19:25.828
It's safer if they
don't find me here

19:25.915 --> 19:26.950
and saves you from
having to kill me.

19:27.042 --> 19:28.202
They'll do it for you.

19:31.421 --> 19:32.410
Deal.

19:36.885 --> 19:39.877
Well, look who isn't dead.

19:39.971 --> 19:41.177
Where's your team?

19:41.264 --> 19:42.424
I'm here to pick
up a solo warrant.

19:42.766 --> 19:46.258
Artura Senbek, Level Two.
Should be
reserved under my name.

19:47.896 --> 19:51.388
So it is.
Witnessed and locked.

19:51.941 --> 19:52.930
(BEEPING)

19:53.026 --> 19:54.186
Thank you.

19:54.611 --> 19:57.444
Hey, maybe don't mention
this one to
Dutch and D'av, okay?

20:01.409 --> 20:03.274
Let's try that again.
(SIGHS)

20:04.954 --> 20:06.239
Be cool, lady.

20:06.748 --> 20:08.079
It's not a big deal.

20:08.500 --> 20:12.368
Need I remind you, squirt,
the last time you kept
a warrant from Dutch,

20:12.462 --> 20:16.250
you all ate shit
sandwiches for a week,
and two of you damn near died.

20:16.424 --> 20:19.507
You know what?
This is none of
your business, Bell.

20:20.261 --> 20:21.922
I can take a solitary
warrant if I want to.

20:22.013 --> 20:23.628
I don't have to
explain myself to you.

20:25.392 --> 20:28.634
You're right. As you were.

20:29.854 --> 20:30.969
Hey.

20:32.273 --> 20:35.936
Whatever you're up to...
They deserve better from you.

20:37.904 --> 20:38.893
(SIGHS)

20:42.992 --> 20:44.448
So, how is this gonna work?

20:44.536 --> 20:47.118
SABINE: I can only
identify Sixes I've met,

20:47.205 --> 20:50.368
but D'avin is different
because of his
gift with the plasma.

20:50.542 --> 20:52.032
And what, exactly,
is this shit?

20:52.127 --> 20:53.583
A neurobinder.

20:53.670 --> 20:55.786
The combined
memories of every Six
gets stored here.

20:56.005 --> 20:58.212
Really strong
Sixes like Khlyen
can connect to the green

20:58.299 --> 21:00.210
and flip through those
memories like a radio dial.

21:00.844 --> 21:03.802
From what he tells me,
sounds like D'av can too.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.673
Ready?
Yes, ma'am.

21:18.695 --> 21:19.810
Give me your hands.

21:21.990 --> 21:24.481
JOHN: So, if he connects
to the green while
wearing Turin's glasses,

21:24.576 --> 21:26.237
he'll be able to
ID all the Sixes.

21:26.619 --> 21:27.654
Nifty.

21:33.293 --> 21:34.408
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

21:34.502 --> 21:35.708
Ready?

21:36.504 --> 21:37.744
Ready-ish.

21:39.549 --> 21:40.629
JOHN: It's working.

21:42.218 --> 21:43.469
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

21:45.054 --> 21:46.305
How do I know if...

21:47.390 --> 21:48.379
(GRUNTS)

21:53.313 --> 21:54.553
Why'd we stop here?

21:58.109 --> 21:59.895
The sky's beautiful, isn't it?

22:02.113 --> 22:03.899
Come on. Race you.

22:05.450 --> 22:07.065
Wait! Stop!

22:08.328 --> 22:09.317
What's wrong?

22:09.412 --> 22:10.697
(D'AVIN PANTING)

22:11.331 --> 22:14.414
I don't understand.
Am I doing it right?

22:14.501 --> 22:16.492
Perfect. You're
doing perfect. Keep going.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.077
Trust me, okay?

22:23.801 --> 22:25.086
What is that thing?

22:25.178 --> 22:26.964
We need to get
inside and find out.

22:29.432 --> 22:30.467
It's resisting me.

22:30.934 --> 22:33.095
You're stronger.
You can do this.

22:43.279 --> 22:44.314
Something's wrong.

22:44.405 --> 22:46.020
Yeah, I see it.
Synaptic overload.

22:46.115 --> 22:47.321
Hey, Dutch,
I can't pull him out.

22:47.408 --> 22:48.443
Sabine, let him go.

22:49.118 --> 22:50.779
Get him out of there. Now!

22:52.539 --> 22:54.245
(BOTH PANTING)

22:54.332 --> 22:56.618
Slow, slow, slow. You okay?

22:57.460 --> 22:58.449
Oh.

22:59.546 --> 23:00.877
Dizzy as shit.

23:00.964 --> 23:02.795
Yeah, I hate that part.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.507
Where were we?
Not sure.

23:06.678 --> 23:07.713
Did we get what you need?

23:07.804 --> 23:10.216
I got a shit ton of hits
before we had to
cut the connection.

23:10.932 --> 23:14.049
Some of these suckers
have last known
addresses in Old Town.

23:14.435 --> 23:15.891
What are they
doing hiding out there?

23:19.983 --> 23:21.223
You okay?

23:21.359 --> 23:24.271
Hey. So, what do we do now?

23:24.654 --> 23:26.986
We hand these over
to Turin, or we go
Six-hunting ourselves?

23:27.282 --> 23:30.991
I don't trust her, Johnny.
And I don't trust
that I don't trust her.

23:31.202 --> 23:34.569
Maybe D'av's right,
and ljust hate her
because he doesn't.

23:34.998 --> 23:36.659
Do you think I'm too
protective of you guys?

23:36.833 --> 23:37.868
You?

23:38.960 --> 23:39.995
Little bit.

23:40.920 --> 23:41.955
But we can take it.

23:44.632 --> 23:45.747
D'av can watch her.

23:46.467 --> 23:49.083
She's not gonna go
anywhere with a bomb
strapped to her neck.

23:49.512 --> 23:52.379
But you and I need
to go make sure
these Sixes are legit.

23:53.057 --> 23:55.264
'Cause if she's playing us,
we have to kill her tonight

23:55.351 --> 23:56.727
before she goes full Six.

23:58.187 --> 23:59.848
We can't let D'av stop us.

24:11.868 --> 24:13.028
It's late. Packing up.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.201
Come on. Just one?

24:18.416 --> 24:19.997
Well, you can have
all of them.

24:20.501 --> 24:21.661
Ta.

24:21.753 --> 24:22.913
JOHN: Boobs are awesome.

24:23.504 --> 24:25.881
They're like
tactical weapons,
but squishy.

24:27.258 --> 24:29.374
Hey, would you stop moving?
I can't get a lock.

24:29.510 --> 24:30.590
(DEVICE BEEPING)

24:32.055 --> 24:35.343
Boom. Another Six. Mark him.

24:35.767 --> 24:37.473
(SNEEZES)
Hey!

24:40.855 --> 24:42.937
Next time,
make this shit taste better.

24:43.650 --> 24:46.357
Hey, that gum adds
an ingenious
track-able biostain

24:46.444 --> 24:47.980
to your spit, thank you.

24:48.071 --> 24:49.982
Won't wash off for weeks,

24:50.073 --> 24:51.779
and they'll never know
we have a fix on them.

24:52.075 --> 24:53.440
DUTCH:
/ don’t like this, Johnny.

24:53.534 --> 24:54.990
Why are there
so many Sixes here,

24:55.078 --> 24:56.443
just sitting around
doing nothing?

24:56.537 --> 24:59.199
It's like... They're
waiting for something.

25:00.041 --> 25:03.249
Well, bright side,
Sabine told the truth,
ID'd her own people.

25:03.753 --> 25:05.334
Maybe D'av's right,
we can trust her.

25:05.963 --> 25:07.089
DUTCH: Maybe.

25:12.303 --> 25:15.045
It's late.
Enough hunting tonight.

25:15.515 --> 25:17.756
Send all the data to Turin
and head back to Lucy.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.227
I'm on my way.

25:23.272 --> 25:24.603
Yeah, me too.

25:31.197 --> 25:33.688
All right, Sabine,
what are you hiding?

25:53.136 --> 25:54.421
SABINE: We already
had sex, you know.

25:54.721 --> 25:55.801
D'AVIN: I remember.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.219
So maybe we
should have sex again,

25:57.306 --> 25:59.388
see ifyou can cure me
before Dutch gets back.

25:59.475 --> 26:01.386
Yeah, because that worked out
so well last time,

26:01.477 --> 26:03.092
what with you dying under me.

26:03.730 --> 26:05.561
Promise not to die this time.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.182
Sorry, not really up
for penis roulette.

26:09.819 --> 26:10.899
Can you at least
get me drunk,

26:10.987 --> 26:12.568
help me keep my
mind off things
while we wait?

26:12.655 --> 26:13.735
That, I can do.

26:14.824 --> 26:19.568
So, what was with
that silver box thing
you were looking for?

26:21.998 --> 26:25.081
I wasn't sure if
you'd remember.
That was me cheating a bit.

26:26.836 --> 26:28.076
How?

26:28.171 --> 26:30.082
I hijacked your
connection to the green

26:30.173 --> 26:32.414
to take one last visit
to my grandfather's farm.

26:32.508 --> 26:33.759
Had a lot of
happy memories there.

26:33.843 --> 26:35.504
Didn't look like
much of a peach farm.

26:35.595 --> 26:38.177
No offense, but you
don't look like
much of a peach farmer.

26:40.808 --> 26:42.423
Can I tell you
something personal?

26:42.518 --> 26:44.099
'Cause I don't really
have time to be coy.

26:45.772 --> 26:47.103
You're my first
real connection

26:47.190 --> 26:50.227
I've been able to
feel with someone
in over 60 years.

26:51.611 --> 26:52.726
You're nice, too.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.322
Wow. Ouch.

26:55.990 --> 26:59.107
What am I supposed to say?
You stalked me and used me.

26:59.202 --> 27:01.067
Now you're flooding
with all these emotions?

27:01.579 --> 27:03.695
But it's heightened.
This isn't real.

27:03.915 --> 27:05.530
It's okay if it
didn't mean more to you.

27:06.709 --> 27:09.246
You don't get to tell me
what it can mean to me, okay?

27:10.838 --> 27:11.827
Fair enough.

27:12.632 --> 27:13.621
Good.

27:14.509 --> 27:15.498
Because whatever I'm feeling,

27:15.593 --> 27:18.050
it's the last real emotion
I'm gonna feel for anyone.

27:18.596 --> 27:20.052
This is all I get.

27:20.723 --> 27:23.180
You're my last butterflies,
D'avin Jaqobis.

27:23.893 --> 27:27.101
You know, all I'm asking
is that you help me
make the best of it.

27:30.316 --> 27:31.305
Okay.

27:32.401 --> 27:33.686
Then I can do
better than this.

27:37.907 --> 27:39.522
Come on.

27:39.951 --> 27:41.236
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

27:41.786 --> 27:43.196
Listen.

27:43.287 --> 27:45.949
My partner's
connected to The Nine,
she can protect you.

27:46.165 --> 27:48.781
She can't protect me
from what I've already done.

27:49.043 --> 27:51.580
You made choices.
Now, here's mine.

27:52.588 --> 27:54.169
A warrant for your arrest.

27:55.258 --> 27:56.418
You help me
shut down the wall,

27:56.509 --> 27:58.465
or I will take you back
to my partner on Qresh.

27:58.761 --> 28:00.752
And then The Company
will know we've talked.

28:02.223 --> 28:04.839
Fine. Greenwell.

28:05.268 --> 28:06.474
You know this name?

28:06.602 --> 28:07.978
No.

28:08.062 --> 28:10.178
It's where they sent
us to test the wall.

28:11.107 --> 28:12.392
A strange group.

28:12.733 --> 28:16.225
Scientists,
behaviorists, engineers.

28:16.529 --> 28:18.394
What the hells
do these walls do?

28:18.489 --> 28:19.604
None of us know.

28:19.824 --> 28:21.985
The technology came
from somewhere else.

28:22.910 --> 28:25.447
And we were just
sent there to build it.

28:25.746 --> 28:27.031
So Greenwell's a town?

28:27.123 --> 28:28.738
Greenwell was a slaughter.

28:28.875 --> 28:34.370
The old, sick, the very young.
All dead in one day. One.

28:35.214 --> 28:38.297
Like they were culling a herd.

28:38.384 --> 28:40.500
And so what happened
to the survivors?

28:40.636 --> 28:41.796
Missing.

28:42.430 --> 28:44.295
The Company took them away.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.470
I tried asking where they
had taken them to, but...

28:48.853 --> 28:51.390
And so they threw you
in Old Town to shut you up?

28:51.480 --> 28:55.393
If I make more trouble,
they will put my
family here, too.

28:55.776 --> 28:58.643
Look, lady, if death
is coming to Old Town,

28:58.738 --> 29:01.605
we don't have time to
play cover-your-ass.

29:03.868 --> 29:04.948
WOMAN: My baby!

29:06.996 --> 29:10.739
I can tell you where
the controls are kept.
I set them up myself.

29:11.208 --> 29:12.197
Where?

29:12.543 --> 29:15.455
Spring Hill.
In Jelco's private office.

over the shirt action.

29:29.727 --> 29:31.183

Oh, damn! (CHUCKLES)

Johnny and l are
lucky we're only brothers.

This is nice. Thank you.

29:46.702 --> 29:47.817
(SIGHS)

29:47.995 --> 29:49.326
They should be back soon.

29:52.708 --> 29:54.699
When Dutch kills me,
I don't want you watching.

29:56.337 --> 29:57.452
She's not gonna kill you.

29:57.546 --> 30:01.130
Not when I'm like this, maybe,
but later, when I turn.

30:02.760 --> 30:03.749
(SIGHS)

30:03.928 --> 30:05.839
I'm sorry.
Should I be lying to us?

30:05.930 --> 30:07.795
We both know
what has to happen.

30:07.890 --> 30:09.096
What do you want
from me, Sabine?

30:09.183 --> 30:10.298
You know what I want.

30:11.060 --> 30:12.891
Not happening.
Can't let you go.

30:13.187 --> 30:15.143
That's not what
I'm asking for.
Then what?

30:16.607 --> 30:17.813
I'm disappearing.

30:19.402 --> 30:20.517
I feel it.

30:20.945 --> 30:24.278
It's this cold nothing
gnawing at my stomach.

30:24.907 --> 30:27.569
All Iwant is to matter to
someone before I'm gone.

30:31.414 --> 30:34.247
That's not fair.
Nothing about this is fair.

30:51.308 --> 30:52.889

you'll miss me.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.769
Tell me I was a good
person when it counted.

one of those things

under her bed like
a dirty little secret.

hobby-shit on your team.

32:09.845 --> 32:11.927
Sabine will kill
your whole team.
That's herjob.

32:12.014 --> 32:13.345
Well, Sabine
blows at herjob.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.093
She told us you had attitude.

32:15.184 --> 32:17.926
Yeah? Well, she told me
about your people, too.

32:23.359 --> 32:24.940
She told me how to kill you.

32:34.703 --> 32:36.739
Where's Johnny?
We've got problems.

32:42.044 --> 32:44.911
I let Sabine go.
I know you're not gonna...

32:45.005 --> 32:46.961
Stop. I can't hear you
over the knife in my back.

32:47.049 --> 32:48.880
Dutch...
She's Black Root!

32:48.968 --> 32:51.630
She's not some
Level Six guardian angel
with boobs

32:51.720 --> 32:53.676
or whatever the hells
you thought she was.

32:53.764 --> 32:55.755
Khlyen didn't
send her to watch us.

32:55.850 --> 32:57.761
She was using us
to find Khlyen.

32:59.186 --> 33:01.222
Okay. Doesn't change anything.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.516
What the shit
does that even mean?

33:04.692 --> 33:07.559
I hid a tracker on her
before I let her go.

33:10.322 --> 33:13.814
Our team always comes first.
Don't ever question that.

33:14.076 --> 33:15.407
Then why let her go?

33:16.328 --> 33:18.239
I didn't want her
last moments to be caged.

to wake up with

33:22.334 --> 33:23.949
You want to hate her
because of it?

33:24.879 --> 33:25.868
I can't.

33:27.006 --> 33:28.291
Any one of us could be her.

33:33.095 --> 33:37.634
Least I could do is not
let her see it coming,
give her a fighting chance.

33:42.897 --> 33:43.886
Sorry.

I'll handle it
from here, okay?

33:55.826 --> 33:57.942
Listen, she hijacked my
connection with the green.

33:58.037 --> 34:00.949
She's looking for
some place on Leith.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.781

is our best chance
of finding it first.

Go, please!

34:58.222 --> 34:59.507
Why are you even here?

34:59.598 --> 35:05.138
I'm so sorry. I panicked.
I warned Jelco
you were coming.

35:06.730 --> 35:11.690
Now, now, you know
the rules. Loose tongues
get cut, Ms. Senbek.

35:11.777 --> 35:13.108
Let her go.

35:13.195 --> 35:14.776
Magnanimous,
but awfully shortsighted.

35:14.863 --> 35:16.444
I'd be more worried
about my own freedom.

35:16.865 --> 35:17.854
Oh.

35:17.950 --> 35:21.283
Nice bluff, sack face.
I'm a RAC Agent.

35:21.370 --> 35:22.655
(CHUCKLES)

35:24.373 --> 35:28.787
Breaking into
a high-ranking officer's
personal quarters

35:28.877 --> 35:31.289
and stealing
Company intelligence.

35:31.380 --> 35:34.998
My, my. Care to
show me the warrant
that covers that? Hmm?

35:37.636 --> 35:39.797
I thought not. Gentlemen.

35:41.932 --> 35:43.047
(GROANS)

35:43.309 --> 35:44.298
(WHIMPERING)

36:00.576 --> 36:01.611
(BEEPING)

36:01.702 --> 36:03.317
FEMALE VOICE:
Target signal in range.

36:19.887 --> 36:20.876
(GRUNTING)

36:22.556 --> 36:24.342
Drop it. Kick it away.

36:25.809 --> 36:27.549
Hands behind your head.

36:27.728 --> 36:29.969
I don't want to hurt you,
I just want to be left alone.

36:30.064 --> 36:31.600
You're Black Root, Sabine.

36:32.274 --> 36:34.560
It only ends in one way.
Why are you out here?

36:34.651 --> 36:36.983
Khlyen has safe houses
stashed all around "The J."

36:37.237 --> 36:38.488
I could never find a trace,

36:38.572 --> 36:41.484
but D'avin seems to have
a direct connection
with him, so I used that.

36:41.575 --> 36:42.735
Because you want
to catch Khlyen.

36:42.826 --> 36:43.906
Because I want help!

36:44.161 --> 36:45.947
(BOTH GRUNTING)

36:59.134 --> 37:00.294
(DUTCH GROANS)

37:06.100 --> 37:08.307
How is Khlyen
supposed to help you?

37:08.977 --> 37:10.183
(GRUNTS)

37:10.270 --> 37:11.259
(PANTING)

37:11.688 --> 37:12.939
He's different.

37:14.066 --> 37:15.431
He feels for you.

37:17.027 --> 37:20.895
He was there
when it all started.
The green, Sixes, The Rack.

37:21.615 --> 37:25.403
Until something
happened and he rebelled.
Something about you.

37:29.665 --> 37:30.825
What about me?

37:31.834 --> 37:32.823
We don't know.

37:34.002 --> 37:37.620
He's taken all memories
of you out of the green,
hidden them from us.

37:38.549 --> 37:40.505
He's protecting
you from something.

37:42.177 --> 37:43.383
You know what's sad?

37:44.179 --> 37:46.431
You're already half Six,
and you don't even know it.

37:46.723 --> 37:47.758
Shut up.

37:50.185 --> 37:52.597
Why do you think Khlyen
trained you like that?

37:52.688 --> 37:55.270
Not how to kill.
How not to care.

37:55.566 --> 37:57.102
Shut your heart down,
scar by scar,

37:57.192 --> 38:00.184
and made you afraid
to trust or love
anyone, even him.

38:00.362 --> 38:03.695
All so you'd have a better
chance of surviving
the Six transition intact.

38:04.575 --> 38:08.318
Deep inside,
most of you is already dead.

38:10.706 --> 38:12.367
You know why you're
with the Jaqobis?

38:13.041 --> 38:14.372
'Cause I have
a thing for brothers?

38:14.793 --> 38:17.705
Because they
feel so damn much.

38:18.547 --> 38:20.458
It's intoxicating,
isn't it?

38:21.216 --> 38:23.673
Being so close to people
who aren't afraid to love.

38:24.887 --> 38:26.548
They haven't figured out
how broken you are yet,

38:26.638 --> 38:29.220
but you know I can see it,
and that's why you hate me.

38:35.522 --> 38:36.511
I'm sorry.

38:37.399 --> 38:38.434
That's not...

38:41.904 --> 38:43.644
This is what
happens near the end.

38:44.865 --> 38:46.446
Just fear and rage.

38:47.784 --> 38:49.285
I'm almost out of time.

38:51.580 --> 38:53.411
You can't let them
do this to you.

38:53.582 --> 38:54.992
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

38:55.083 --> 38:56.368
They'll come for you.

38:57.252 --> 38:59.538
They'll rip everything
out of you that matters.

39:00.255 --> 39:03.247
You're the walking dead,
only no one will let you die.

39:11.391 --> 39:12.767
You have to do it.

39:17.105 --> 39:18.390
I'll come for you.

39:19.775 --> 39:23.063
Kill Johnny, kill D'avin,
and lwon't even care.

39:24.613 --> 39:25.944
I'd do it for you.

39:29.117 --> 39:30.527
I'm not doing this for you.

39:39.086 --> 39:40.622
(SIGHS)

40:27.718 --> 40:28.707
(SIGHS)

41:33.367 --> 41:34.573
DUTCH: Sabine was wrong.

41:35.744 --> 41:38.030
Khlyen didn't make
that safe house for Sixes.

41:39.414 --> 41:40.699
He made it for me.

41:41.083 --> 41:45.122
Everything there was
like a message
I couldn't decode yet.

41:46.797 --> 41:49.083
I think she led me there
before I was
supposed to find it.

41:51.593 --> 41:53.504
D'AVIN: Do you think
the shot to the head
was enough?

41:54.554 --> 41:55.839
Did you stay with her?

41:59.017 --> 42:00.006
Why not?

42:02.145 --> 42:04.602
Guess I thought she deserved
a fighting chance.

42:08.902 --> 42:11.439
Another red box.
Another kill job.

42:11.988 --> 42:13.023
You gonna open it?

42:13.407 --> 42:14.442
I already did.

42:24.209 --> 42:25.619
It says "Aneela."

42:27.295 --> 42:28.455
What if it's her?

42:29.548 --> 42:31.379
The other me
you saw on Arkyn?

42:33.218 --> 42:34.628
I think she's still alive.

42:37.055 --> 42:38.636
Khlyen wants me to kill her.

42:41.810 --> 42:43.846
(MUSIC PLAYING)
