WEBVTT

00:01.501 --> 00:04.003
I got an offer on Fairfield.

00:04.038 --> 00:05.238
It's not exactly
what we were asking,

00:05.272 --> 00:07.206
but it's definitely
in the ballpark.

00:07.241 --> 00:08.541
So you're gonna accept it?

00:08.575 --> 00:10.843
I have to weigh
all of my options, don't I?

00:10.877 --> 00:12.597
That's what this trip's
all about, isn't it?

00:12.612 --> 00:13.612
<i>What are you doing?!</i>

00:13.680 --> 00:14.713
Going for a ride.
You wanna come?

00:14.748 --> 00:17.316
You can't!
Jack would never let you!

00:17.350 --> 00:19.885
- Hey! I'll fall!
- Hold on!

00:19.920 --> 00:22.387
<i>Make a left turn
on range road one three five.</i>

00:22.422 --> 00:24.957
That doesn't look like much!

00:24.991 --> 00:27.859
The GPS is programmed
to choose the shortest route.

00:27.893 --> 00:29.694
Here goes nothin'.

00:29.728 --> 00:32.764
Nothing to worry about.

00:37.603 --> 00:39.637
<i>Turn right in 100 metres.</i>

00:39.672 --> 00:41.106
Hey, slow down, or
you're gonna miss the turn!

00:41.140 --> 00:44.141
I can't miss a turn
that doesn't exist, Lis!

00:44.176 --> 00:45.577
<i>Recalculating.</i>

00:45.611 --> 00:48.012
If that thing says
"recalculating" one more time,

00:48.046 --> 00:51.516
I swear I'm gonna huck it
right out this window!

00:51.550 --> 00:54.486
Okay! Gosh!

00:54.520 --> 00:55.687
Well, what do we do?

00:55.721 --> 00:56.888
Are we gonna go back
the same way we came?

00:56.922 --> 00:59.656
I don't think
that's a good idea.

00:59.724 --> 01:01.392
We've been on the road
for hours now,

01:01.460 --> 01:03.961
we're running low on fuel...

01:03.996 --> 01:06.297
I think the best thing to do
is stay on course

01:06.331 --> 01:10.968
and hope this road ends up
somewhere civilized.

01:11.036 --> 01:12.036
<i>Recalculating.</i>

01:12.070 --> 01:13.437
That's it!

01:13.472 --> 01:16.339
No, don't! Don't you dare!
Don't!

01:19.477 --> 01:22.579
No, you're gonna
ruin the surprise!

01:23.915 --> 01:25.716
Hey, I appreciate you making me

01:25.750 --> 01:26.950
a birthday cake and everything,

01:27.018 --> 01:29.152
it's just...

01:29.220 --> 01:30.754
it's weird seeing you
baking right now!

01:30.788 --> 01:32.629
I mean when was the last time
you boiled water?

01:32.689 --> 01:33.823
Yeah, okay,

01:33.891 --> 01:36.026
I admit cooking
isn't exactly my strong suit,

01:36.060 --> 01:39.429
but this is a cake, Ty,
how hard can it be?

01:39.463 --> 01:40.530
Dad, you're back!

01:40.597 --> 01:42.465
Yeah.

01:42.533 --> 01:44.667
Funny,
I ran into Tricia downtown,

01:44.735 --> 01:47.003
and it turns out
her mother is very sick

01:47.071 --> 01:50.039
and she has to leave
for Toronto.

01:50.073 --> 01:51.974
That- that's not funny.

01:52.009 --> 01:53.509
Is everything okay?

01:53.577 --> 01:56.278
Uh, so she asked
if I would do her a favour.

01:56.346 --> 01:57.914
What kind of favour?

01:57.948 --> 01:59.148
<i>Don't worry about me,</i>

01:59.182 --> 02:01.851
I'll just carry
all this stupid crap myself!

02:01.919 --> 02:04.819
Ty, Amy, this is Jade
Virani, Tricia's daughter.

02:04.887 --> 02:05.820
Do you guys have anything
to eat?

02:05.888 --> 02:07.923
I'm, like, starving!

02:09.000 --> 02:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:16.066 --> 02:17.899
Oh, hey there, roomie!

02:17.967 --> 02:18.934
Jade?!

02:19.001 --> 02:20.969
Who's this guy?
He's really hot!

02:21.003 --> 02:22.938
Gross!
That's my brother!

02:22.972 --> 02:23.972
And that's my charm bracelet!

02:24.040 --> 02:25.807
Who said you could touch
my stuff?!

02:25.875 --> 02:28.009
Chill out,
I was just looking at it.

02:28.077 --> 02:31.012
Hey! Look at you two!

02:31.080 --> 02:32.480
What is she doing here?

02:32.548 --> 02:33.782
Jade? She's staying with us
for a few days

02:33.849 --> 02:36.384
while her mother deals
with a medical emergency.

02:36.452 --> 02:39.019
My grandma's undergoing
a major operation.

02:39.088 --> 02:40.221
They say you're not
supposed to have

02:40.255 --> 02:42.223
more than three facelifts
in a lifetime.

02:42.291 --> 02:44.192
This is her seventh.

02:44.259 --> 02:46.227
Okay...

02:46.295 --> 02:48.829
Anyway, you two hit it off
so well at the fishing camp,

02:48.863 --> 02:50.764
I thought you might want
to share a room together.

02:50.799 --> 02:53.501
Gosh, Mr. Fleming,
we did have a really good time.

02:53.535 --> 02:55.803
I just love Georgia.

02:55.837 --> 02:57.270
It's Geor-gie!

02:57.338 --> 02:59.272
She even let me
borrow her charm bracelet.

02:59.307 --> 03:01.208
No, I-
Hah! Okay!

03:01.275 --> 03:02.242
But- hmph!

03:02.276 --> 03:03.644
So I'll see you later,

03:03.678 --> 03:05.545
and maybe I'll pick up a pizza
for dinner, all right?

03:05.580 --> 03:06.947
Bye!

03:06.982 --> 03:08.015
Give it back!

03:08.083 --> 03:09.750
I never said
you could borrow it!

03:09.784 --> 03:13.186
Relax, kid,
I was just trying it on.

03:26.867 --> 03:28.968
Well, it's official.

03:29.003 --> 03:30.069
We're out of gas,

03:30.137 --> 03:32.371
and your GPS has no idea
where we are!

03:34.842 --> 03:37.476
And I have no cell signal.

03:37.511 --> 03:38.477
I can't believe it!

03:38.512 --> 03:39.879
Okay...

03:39.913 --> 03:41.413
here's what we're gonna do:

03:41.448 --> 03:44.483
I'll head back toward
the main road.

03:44.518 --> 03:46.752
As soon as I find
a cell signal,

03:46.786 --> 03:48.220
well, I'll just call for help.

03:48.255 --> 03:50.356
And me,
what am I supposed to do?

03:50.390 --> 03:52.024
Well, you stay here.

03:52.058 --> 03:54.360
So if something happens to
you and I end up here stranded,

03:54.394 --> 03:56.695
I'll just live off
what's in my purse?!

03:56.729 --> 03:58.164
<i>Oh no, wait!</i>

03:58.198 --> 04:00.132
I have gum.
I'll be good for a week, you go.

04:00.166 --> 04:01.232
All right.

04:02.168 --> 04:04.102
You and me, we'll go together.

04:04.137 --> 04:05.370
Thank you!

04:06.706 --> 04:08.674
So now what are you doing?!

04:08.708 --> 04:10.008
I'm going to get Cinders!

04:10.076 --> 04:11.643
I can't leave him abandoned
on the side of the road!

04:11.678 --> 04:13.045
He'll be just fine.

04:13.112 --> 04:14.913
We can leave him where he is.

04:14.947 --> 04:17.447
Jack, what if a logging truck
comes barreling down here

04:17.516 --> 04:19.149
and smashes into the back
of the trailer? No.

04:19.218 --> 04:20.817
And what if we don't get back
in time to water him

04:20.851 --> 04:22.119
and he dies of colic?

04:22.154 --> 04:23.854
Sorry, I've invested
far too much in that horse

04:23.922 --> 04:24.955
to do that!

04:24.990 --> 04:27.225
You do what you need to do.

04:27.259 --> 04:30.595
Please... hurry it up,
we're losing daylight.

04:30.629 --> 04:32.230
Yes, sir!

04:32.856 --> 04:36.976
<i>Continue on current
route for 79.5 kilometres.</i>

04:39.727 --> 04:42.013
<i>Recalculating.</i>

04:42.133 --> 04:43.482

get us back to the main road?</i>

05:31.556 --> 05:34.058
<i>It should've been a shortcut,</i>

05:34.125 --> 05:37.161
but I thought we'd be there
by now.

05:38.763 --> 05:40.530
Here, let me take that for you.

05:40.565 --> 05:41.631
Oh, thanks.

05:43.267 --> 05:44.634
Okay...

05:49.239 --> 05:50.306
Come on.

05:53.143 --> 05:55.278
Your old man just sold
that entire flock of sheep,

05:55.312 --> 05:57.280
and for a tidy profit,
I might add!

05:57.314 --> 05:58.814
That's great.

05:58.848 --> 06:02.017
Yeah, well,
the only catch is...

06:02.052 --> 06:04.019
that I have to truck them
out of here tomorrow.

06:04.088 --> 06:06.522
I hope you're not expecting me
to look after the girls!

06:06.590 --> 06:07.856
<i>Well, Georgie's old enough.</i>

06:07.891 --> 06:08.891
You know,
she can look after herself

06:08.925 --> 06:09.925
for a few hours.

06:09.993 --> 06:11.760
It's not Georgie
I'm worried about.

06:11.795 --> 06:13.662
Jade?
She's harmless!

06:13.697 --> 06:16.264
Yeah, harmless.
She stole grandpa's truck!

06:16.299 --> 06:17.967
Yeah, she stole
the tr-

06:18.001 --> 06:19.868
but she apologized!

06:20.837 --> 06:22.905
Sort of.
Okay, I'll do it.

06:22.939 --> 06:24.940
Oh, honey, I know
it's an inconvenience,

06:24.975 --> 06:27.710
but her mother practically
cornered me at Maggie's

06:27.744 --> 06:29.264
and guilted me into
taking care of her,

06:29.278 --> 06:31.879
so what was I supposed to do?

06:31.914 --> 06:33.448
Hmm.

06:33.483 --> 06:35.083
What is that?

06:35.118 --> 06:36.918
<i>Ty's birthday cake.</i>

06:36.952 --> 06:39.020
It looks like
a birthday pancake.

06:39.054 --> 06:40.622
Thanks, dad.

06:44.793 --> 06:46.861
What am I doing wrong?

06:59.407 --> 07:03.477
Okay. We're lost.

07:05.547 --> 07:09.716
I was sure this would get us
back to the main road.

07:09.751 --> 07:13.154
Well, look, you've got something
in common with the GPS.

07:13.221 --> 07:14.388
Are you recalculating?

07:14.422 --> 07:16.223
No, don't go there!

07:16.258 --> 07:17.625
"Recalculating."

07:17.692 --> 07:19.526
You know, we
wouldn't be in this mess

07:19.560 --> 07:21.427
if it wasn't for
your blind faith

07:21.462 --> 07:22.729
in modern technology!

07:22.764 --> 07:25.832
All right...
What ever happened to a paper map,

07:25.867 --> 07:27.000
and a compass?

07:27.035 --> 07:28.101
Why don't you have them
in your pocket,

07:28.136 --> 07:30.403
next to your sextant
and your abacus?

07:30.471 --> 07:32.739
Okay.
I get your point.

07:35.209 --> 07:37.043
It's too late to get back
to the truck before dark.

07:37.110 --> 07:40.346
We're gonna have to find
a place to set up a camp.

07:40.381 --> 07:41.581
I hate camping!

07:41.649 --> 07:44.217
Well, we don't
have much choice, Lis!

07:44.285 --> 07:46.486
Besides, didn't you used
to be a girl guide?

07:46.520 --> 07:48.354
Yes, best years of my life!

07:48.422 --> 07:51.123
Well, surely you went camping
with them.

07:51.191 --> 07:53.425
No I didn't, I avoided it!

07:53.459 --> 07:54.894
And how did you manage that?

07:54.928 --> 07:56.929
Well, I sold a lot of cookies!

07:59.465 --> 08:00.733
Hi, Lisa, it's Amy.

08:00.801 --> 08:03.268
I'm just wondering
how you and grandpa are doing.

08:03.303 --> 08:05.337
I tried calling his phone,
but no luck,

08:05.405 --> 08:06.672
so give me a call when you can.

08:06.740 --> 08:08.740
Okay?

08:08.808 --> 08:10.242
Is everything all right?

08:10.276 --> 08:13.212
Yeah, I just- I thought grandpa
would be home a long time ago.

08:13.279 --> 08:14.846
Well, maybe he got stuck
in some traffic on the highway

08:14.914 --> 08:16.014
or something.

08:16.048 --> 08:18.917
Yeah, maybe.
I just expected him to call.

08:18.984 --> 08:20.719
Yeah. Are you ready
for dinner?

08:20.753 --> 08:22.020
Yes, I am!

08:22.088 --> 08:25.489
Um, Ty, I have a little bit
of bad news.

08:25.557 --> 08:27.158
What's that?

08:27.226 --> 08:30.128
Your cake...
it was a total disaster.

08:30.196 --> 08:32.330
Hey, Amy, I don't mind,
it's okay.

08:32.397 --> 08:33.496
No, it's your birthday,

08:33.532 --> 08:35.172
and I just wanted it
to be perfect, and I-

08:35.234 --> 08:38.635
hey, it will be perfect.
You know why?

08:38.669 --> 08:40.738
Because you're spending it
with me?

08:44.208 --> 08:46.577
No, because you're buying me
an expensive dinner.

08:46.612 --> 08:48.579
Hey!

08:50.215 --> 08:51.249
Let's go!

09:03.427 --> 09:05.095
What is that you're humming?

09:05.163 --> 09:06.263
I know that, what is that tune?

09:06.330 --> 09:09.566
It's called,
"Walk me over the bridge."

09:10.635 --> 09:12.535
<i>Oh yeah...</i>

Nope! There'll be tons

10:34.616 --> 10:35.983
What?

10:36.017 --> 10:37.051
Food!

10:37.118 --> 10:39.019
Dig in while it's hot.

10:39.087 --> 10:40.221
Give it back!

10:40.255 --> 10:42.223
What's your problem?

10:42.290 --> 10:43.490
You took it!

10:43.558 --> 10:44.758
I don't even know
what you're talking about!

10:44.826 --> 10:46.927
My bracelet, it's gone!

10:46.995 --> 10:48.896
Well, I don't have it!
Yes, you do!

10:48.964 --> 10:50.697
Girls!

10:51.900 --> 10:53.099
Georgie,

10:53.167 --> 10:54.634
I thought that Jade said
you'd let her borrow it.

10:54.702 --> 10:56.703
That was a lie,
and now she's stolen it!

10:56.738 --> 10:58.037
I don't even like
that ugly bracelet,

10:58.105 --> 10:59.373
so why would I steal it?

10:59.440 --> 11:00.974
I don't know,
why'd you steal Jack's truck?!

11:01.041 --> 11:03.176
<i>Okay! Girls!</i>

11:03.244 --> 11:05.512
Jade, if you took it,

11:05.580 --> 11:07.080
just return it
and we'll forget all about it.

11:07.114 --> 11:08.849
What ever happened to innocent
until proven guilty?

11:08.916 --> 11:10.816
I didn't say you took it.
But if you did...

11:10.885 --> 11:11.817
I didn't!

11:11.886 --> 11:13.753
Yes, you did!
No, I didn't!

11:13.820 --> 11:14.854
Did too!
Did not!

11:14.922 --> 11:15.855
<i>That's enough!</i>

11:15.923 --> 11:17.723
Obviously it was a bad idea

11:17.791 --> 11:19.192
putting you two
in the same room together,

11:19.260 --> 11:20.960
so I'd like you to go upstairs,
get your stuff,

11:21.028 --> 11:23.029
and you can stay in that room
down the hall.

11:23.097 --> 11:24.697
Happy to!

11:28.435 --> 11:29.468
And next time you decide

11:29.536 --> 11:31.704
to put a kleptomaniac
in my room,

11:31.772 --> 11:33.539
ask me first!

11:37.143 --> 11:38.411
A klepto...

11:39.379 --> 11:42.114
Mmm!

11:45.584 --> 11:50.622
Well, I better make
sure he's good for the night.

11:54.527 --> 11:59.063
<i>♪ And I know
what's ahead is worth more ♪</i>

11:59.131 --> 12:04.402
<i>♪ So let's go for a walk
somewhere quiet to talk ♪</i>

12:04.437 --> 12:07.204
<i>♪ we'll see just what life's</i>
<i>got in store ♪</i>

12:07.272 --> 12:09.974
That was a beautiful song.

12:11.276 --> 12:12.844
You miss her, don't you?

12:12.912 --> 12:16.513
I miss Lyndy sometimes.

12:16.581 --> 12:19.750
But I love you all the time,

12:19.784 --> 12:22.719
whether I go to France or not.

12:23.655 --> 12:26.723
And one day I will go with you.

12:28.226 --> 12:29.660
Okay.

12:29.694 --> 12:32.496
I'm gonna hold you to it.

12:32.564 --> 12:34.865
Will you dance with me?

12:34.899 --> 12:36.032
I will.

12:38.302 --> 12:41.004
<i>♪ Just walk me
over the bridge my darling ♪</i>

12:44.676 --> 12:46.409
Atta boy!

12:51.548 --> 12:53.116
There we go!

12:55.652 --> 12:57.120
That's just silly!

12:57.154 --> 13:00.156
Plenty of room in there
for both of us.

13:01.825 --> 13:03.693
And a storm's coming.

13:03.727 --> 13:05.127
Come on.

13:12.268 --> 13:13.569
Oh man!

13:25.448 --> 13:28.450
'Kay, just please let me
know if you hear anything.

13:28.485 --> 13:30.352
Okay.
You have my number?

13:30.420 --> 13:31.653
Great, thanks.

13:31.687 --> 13:32.954
Everything okay?

13:32.989 --> 13:34.490
Well, that was the guy
who bought Lisa's horse.

13:34.557 --> 13:37.059
He was expecting Jack and Lisa
to drop Cinders off hours ago,

13:37.093 --> 13:38.359
but they never showed.

13:38.394 --> 13:39.561
Did you call Lisa's phone?

13:39.595 --> 13:41.262
'Cause you can bet Jack
didn't take his.

13:41.296 --> 13:42.564
I did, there was no answer.

13:42.598 --> 13:43.632
We've been trying all night.

13:43.666 --> 13:45.567
Okay, well, let's not panic.

13:45.635 --> 13:47.002
Okay?

13:47.036 --> 13:48.870
You know, they probably
just stopped

13:48.905 --> 13:49.871
and got a motel room.

13:49.906 --> 13:51.205
It's a long way to Montana.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.742
No, if they had stopped,
grandpa would've called!

13:53.809 --> 13:55.743
Amy, honey, there's nothing
we can do tonight anyway.

13:55.810 --> 13:56.911
It's pitch black out there!

13:58.380 --> 14:00.014
Not to mention that storm.

14:00.049 --> 14:01.315
We can't just sit here!

14:01.383 --> 14:05.219
Well, it's a little early
to sound the alarm.

14:05.287 --> 14:07.155
I'll bet Jack and Lisa
got back together again

14:07.222 --> 14:08.656
<i>and they're so wrapped up</i>
<i>in each other,</i>

14:08.723 --> 14:11.158
they forgot to call.

15:09.481 --> 15:12.048
Oh no!

15:14.619 --> 15:15.786
Argh!

15:17.589 --> 15:18.922
Hi!

15:18.990 --> 15:20.558
Cinders, he's gone!

15:20.592 --> 15:22.626
What?!

15:22.694 --> 15:23.794
Oh no!

15:25.396 --> 15:26.796
Cinders!

15:27.866 --> 15:30.067
The storm must've spooked him.

15:30.101 --> 15:31.568
I should've checked on him.

15:31.602 --> 15:32.936
It's not your fault.

15:32.971 --> 15:36.039
There's nothing
you could've done.

15:38.579 --> 15:41.019
Well, this trip has just
been one disaster after another!

15:41.044 --> 15:42.345
I know!

15:42.380 --> 15:46.315
When it comes to travelling,
we never had much luck.

15:46.350 --> 15:48.418
Yeah, that is true.

15:49.687 --> 15:51.220
I think he went through here.

15:54.642 --> 15:57.002
<i>What else did you keep
your mouth shut about in France?</i>

15:57.027 --> 15:58.427
Well, I don't think
I had a decent meal

15:58.461 --> 16:00.329
the entire time we were there!

16:00.364 --> 16:02.365
What?!

16:02.399 --> 16:04.066
We ate at some of
the best restaurants

16:04.101 --> 16:05.201
in all of Europe!

16:05.235 --> 16:06.903
Well, it's pretty hard
to enjoy your meal

16:06.937 --> 16:09.038
when the waiter's looking down
his nose at you

16:09.072 --> 16:10.339
like you're some kind of hick

16:10.407 --> 16:12.508
that's never seen
a salad fork before!

16:12.542 --> 16:13.575
Maybe it had something
to do with the fact

16:13.610 --> 16:15.477
that you're scrutinizing
the menu

16:15.512 --> 16:16.745
like a penny-pinching
miser!

16:16.813 --> 16:18.213
I've always done that.

16:18.247 --> 16:20.416
You know you can't teach
an old dog new tricks!

16:20.450 --> 16:21.617
No, you can't!

16:21.651 --> 16:23.084
I can't even-
I can't believe you lied!

16:23.119 --> 16:24.853
I didn't lie!
But you did, though!

16:24.921 --> 16:26.455
I just kept my mouth shut.

16:26.489 --> 16:28.223
Well, that is exactly
the same thing!

16:28.257 --> 16:29.758
I went on the trip, Lis!

16:29.793 --> 16:32.427
What else do you want from me?!

16:34.630 --> 16:35.863
<i>Lis!</i>

16:37.934 --> 16:39.100
Lisa!

16:39.135 --> 16:41.202
<i>He went this way.</i>

16:46.309 --> 16:47.842
Over here!

16:47.910 --> 16:49.644
Look at this.

16:51.046 --> 16:53.614
He went across the creek.

17:08.396 --> 17:10.097
Oh my God!
Jack!

17:11.531 --> 17:13.400
Uh...

17:13.468 --> 17:16.203
Nice and slow, Lis.
We don't wanna work him up.

17:17.738 --> 17:19.306
You all right?

17:19.340 --> 17:21.107
<i>He must've slid down
during the storm last night.</i>

17:21.175 --> 17:23.643
Cinders, you okay?

17:23.711 --> 17:24.877
Can we even get him
out of here?

17:24.945 --> 17:27.446
I don't know,
he's down there quite a ways.

17:27.515 --> 17:29.616
And we can't move those rocks,

17:29.684 --> 17:31.985
<i>and the sides</i>
<i>are way too steep.</i>

17:32.052 --> 17:33.286
We can do this.

17:33.354 --> 17:35.355
<i>Maybe we can get
him out this way.</i>

17:36.756 --> 17:39.492
We're gonna need a saw
to move these logs here.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.894
Do you have something like that
<i>in your trailer?</i>

17:41.962 --> 17:42.962
No.

17:42.997 --> 17:44.897
Easy now, easy now.

17:44.965 --> 17:46.332
This is what we're gonna do:

17:46.400 --> 17:49.469
Give me your phone,
I'll hike up to higher ground.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.204
When I get a signal,
I'll call for help.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.231
I'm gonna come with you.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.006
No, you stay here this time.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.741
You gotta keep this horse calm,

17:55.775 --> 17:57.810
make sure
he doesn't get dehydrated.

17:57.878 --> 18:00.913
<i>What if something
happens to you, then?</i>

18:00.947 --> 18:03.883
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.985
I won't be long, I promise!

18:06.920 --> 18:09.321
Just make sure he stays calm
'til I get back.

18:09.355 --> 18:11.256
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

18:11.290 --> 18:12.957
Here...

18:12.992 --> 18:14.559
take this with you.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.562
You won't be gone long?

18:17.630 --> 18:18.963
I'll be back
before you know it.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.465
<i>Okay.</i>

18:25.905 --> 18:28.372
How'd you do this?
How'd you do it?

18:36.015 --> 18:37.715
Hey. Hey!

18:37.750 --> 18:39.884
Why don't you have some waffles
with your whipped cream?

18:42.921 --> 18:44.221
Any word on Jack?

18:44.256 --> 18:46.157
No, nothing, and the police
won't do anything

18:46.191 --> 18:48.559
until he's been missing
for at least twenty-four hours.

18:48.593 --> 18:49.726
We should head out now,

18:49.761 --> 18:51.828
retrace the route
that Jack and Lisa took.

18:51.863 --> 18:53.164
I'm coming too.

18:53.198 --> 18:56.667
No, no, kid, this is a job
best left for adults.

18:56.701 --> 18:58.735
Well, what if something
happened to Jack?

18:58.770 --> 18:59.970
I wanna help!

19:00.004 --> 19:01.137
<i>No, he's gonna be fine.</i>

19:01.172 --> 19:02.138
This is a precaution,
that's all.

19:02.173 --> 19:04.041
Don't worry.

19:04.075 --> 19:06.476
Hey, is Jack that old guy?
The cowboy?

19:06.510 --> 19:07.911
Yeah, my grandpa.

19:07.946 --> 19:10.180
I liked him.
He was really cool.

19:10.214 --> 19:11.414
Anyway, I hope he's okay.

19:11.482 --> 19:13.516
Yeah, me too.

19:26.430 --> 19:27.763
Ah!

19:36.539 --> 19:38.608
Oh, come on! Dammit!

19:52.718 --> 19:53.998
<i>So they were
headed to a ranch</i>

19:54.023 --> 19:55.023
<i>just south of</i>
<i>the Montana border,</i>

19:55.091 --> 19:56.391
<i>right around here.</i>

19:56.426 --> 19:57.892
<i>Uh, that'd be about
three hours away.</i>

19:57.960 --> 19:59.294
Yeah, unless they took
a shortcut.

19:59.329 --> 20:00.569
No, they were hauling
a trailer.

20:00.597 --> 20:01.930
They wouldn't have strayed
from the main highway.

20:01.998 --> 20:03.865
Well, I think I'll check
some of these secondary roads,

20:03.933 --> 20:05.233
see if I can find 'em.

20:05.267 --> 20:08.603
Hey, it's Lisa!
Lisa, hi!

20:08.671 --> 20:12.373
Amy? Oh boy, is it good
to hear your voice!

20:12.407 --> 20:14.976
Grandpa, how are you?
Where are you?

20:15.044 --> 20:17.846
We ran out of gas,
but Lisa and I, we're okay.

20:17.913 --> 20:19.014
Okay, they're okay.
They're fine.

20:19.081 --> 20:20.015
Okay, let...

20:20.082 --> 20:21.315
<i>Now listen,</i>

20:21.350 --> 20:23.284
<i>there was a pretty bad storm</i>
<i>here last night</i>

20:23.352 --> 20:25.386
and Cinders got spooked.

20:25.454 --> 20:28.756
He managed to get himself
trapped in a gully.

20:28.823 --> 20:30.858
So I need you and Ty

20:30.925 --> 20:33.427
to get down here
with my chainsaw.

20:33.495 --> 20:35.062
Okay, I got it, grandpa,
but where are you?

20:35.130 --> 20:36.564
Now...

20:36.632 --> 20:41.401
We ended up on a logging road.
It's range road 135.

20:41.469 --> 20:44.237
Okay. Range road
one three five, yep.

20:44.305 --> 20:48.676
Now, there's a trail
about 200 yards west

20:48.743 --> 20:50.577
of where Lisa's truck
is parked.

20:50.645 --> 20:52.913
<i>You keep going</i>
<i>until you come to a creek.</i>

20:52.947 --> 20:55.515
The gully is on the other side
of that creek.

20:55.583 --> 20:58.084
Okay, I got it. We'll
be there in a few hours.

20:58.118 --> 21:01.221
Amy, is Ty close by?

21:01.255 --> 21:02.689
Yeah, he's right here.

21:02.723 --> 21:03.956
Put him on.

21:03.991 --> 21:05.659
He wants to talk to you.

21:05.693 --> 21:06.793
Okay, we'll get supplies.

21:06.860 --> 21:07.794
Okay.

21:07.861 --> 21:09.296
Jack, hey.

21:09.330 --> 21:14.333
Ty, there's a bottle
of pills in my bedside table

21:14.367 --> 21:16.703
and I need you
to bring them to me.

21:16.737 --> 21:21.140
Now, don't let anyone see you,
they'll just start to worry.

21:21.175 --> 21:22.575
<i>Can you do that for me?</i>

21:22.642 --> 21:24.744
Yeah, of course!
Is everything okay?

21:24.812 --> 21:26.512
Ty?

21:26.546 --> 21:27.946
Ty?

21:28.014 --> 21:29.848
Jack...

21:34.321 --> 21:36.255
Alrighty,
I've just gotta grab my coat

21:36.289 --> 21:38.357
and we can go play!

22:30.653 --> 22:31.719
Hey.

22:35.524 --> 22:39.941
So, um... Jack called
and he's okay.

22:40.061 --> 22:43.334
Tim said it was just a big fuss
about nothing.

22:53.226 --> 22:55.727
I told you I didn't steal
your stupid bracelet!

22:55.761 --> 22:57.762
I know, and I'm sorry.

22:57.830 --> 23:00.465
I guess I just forgot
where I put it.

23:00.500 --> 23:01.633
Yeah, right!

23:01.668 --> 23:02.701
You were doing that on purpose.

23:02.735 --> 23:04.135
You wanted to get me
in trouble.

23:04.170 --> 23:05.904
No, I wasn't!

23:08.140 --> 23:09.874
I said I was sorry.

23:09.942 --> 23:11.009
Have you ever heard
of the expression,

23:11.043 --> 23:12.110
"Eye for an eye?"

23:12.178 --> 23:13.712
Yeah.

23:13.746 --> 23:18.282
Well, if I were you,
I'd watch my back.

23:33.198 --> 23:35.233
- Lisa!
- Here!

23:36.602 --> 23:38.269
Hey!

23:38.303 --> 23:39.604
Oh!

23:42.406 --> 23:44.007
Oh!

23:44.075 --> 23:45.109
You're back.

23:48.246 --> 23:49.412
Well, I got through.

23:49.480 --> 23:51.849
You did?
Amy and Ty are on their way.

23:51.883 --> 23:55.352
Oh! Good!

23:56.654 --> 23:58.521
Come on, come on!

23:58.589 --> 24:00.790
<i>Come on!</i>

24:00.858 --> 24:02.692
<i>Come on!</i>

24:04.795 --> 24:06.796
Come on, come on.
Come on!

24:06.830 --> 24:09.399
<i>Come on!</i>
<i>Everybody goes!</i>

24:10.968 --> 24:12.636
That's it.

24:16.640 --> 24:18.440
Hey, you forgot one.

24:18.475 --> 24:20.243
Where?
Over there.

24:21.411 --> 24:22.779
<i>Oh, no, that's Clover.</i>

24:22.813 --> 24:25.248
That's Georgie's 4h sheep.

24:25.282 --> 24:26.582
What does that mean?

24:26.616 --> 24:29.218
That means she's responsible
for taking care of him.

24:29.253 --> 24:30.319
Oh.

24:31.617 --> 24:32.897
Look, I know
that you and Georgie

24:32.922 --> 24:34.256
aren't exactly getting along,

24:34.291 --> 24:35.691
but I kinda hope...

24:35.725 --> 24:37.893
that you might look after her
while I'm gone?

24:37.927 --> 24:38.927
Oh, absolutely.

24:38.961 --> 24:39.895
Me and Georgie talked about it

24:39.962 --> 24:40.996
and we decided to put

24:41.063 --> 24:42.097
the whole bracelet thing
behind us.

24:42.131 --> 24:43.699
Really?
I didn't know that.

24:43.733 --> 24:46.468
Yeah, I think we're gonna have
a lot of fun together.

24:55.111 --> 24:56.845
<i>You okay?</i>

24:58.147 --> 25:00.481
Yeah, I'm fine.

25:00.516 --> 25:03.218
You know what I thought
about a lot when...

25:03.252 --> 25:06.621
I heard you had
your heart attack?

25:07.556 --> 25:10.257
Just how much time
we spent arguing

25:10.292 --> 25:15.029
about vacation homes
and trips to France.

25:16.365 --> 25:18.433
That just all seemed
so unimportant

25:18.467 --> 25:20.468
and silly,

25:20.502 --> 25:22.937
when all I really wanted to do
was just...

25:23.004 --> 25:24.671
I just wanted
to spend time with you.

25:24.706 --> 25:25.940
Well...

25:25.974 --> 25:29.576
I was so happy
when you came back last winter.

25:29.644 --> 25:31.045
You were?

25:36.318 --> 25:38.418
<i>You okay?</i>

25:38.486 --> 25:40.320
Send it back.

25:41.255 --> 25:42.922
Well, do you wanna
give it a try first?

25:42.990 --> 25:44.458
I don't need to give it a try,

25:44.492 --> 25:47.461
I'm perfectly comfortable
in my own bed!

25:47.495 --> 25:49.663
Okay, but I think...

25:49.697 --> 25:54.100
just maybe give it a chance
'cause it's adjustable

25:54.134 --> 25:55.434
and...

25:55.502 --> 25:57.403
the mattress is a really lovely
memory foam.

25:57.471 --> 25:59.405
I said, send it back!

26:00.374 --> 26:04.010
Okay. Fine.

26:04.044 --> 26:05.711
Why do you have to fight me
on everything?

26:05.779 --> 26:07.947
I'm trying to just-
I'm trying to take care of you!

26:08.015 --> 26:10.883
I don't need
you to be my nurse!

26:12.652 --> 26:14.553
You had a heart attack!

26:14.588 --> 26:17.523
We can't just pretend
that you're okay.

26:17.557 --> 26:20.393
<i>If you don't want
me to take care of you,</i>

26:20.460 --> 26:21.927
I-I-I get that.

26:23.997 --> 26:26.899
I just don't know
what I'm supposed to be doing!

26:26.966 --> 26:28.566
You don't tell me how you feel
or what you need,

26:28.634 --> 26:33.138
and I came back from France
to be here for you!

26:33.206 --> 26:36.408
And it just feels like
it's obviously not working.

26:36.442 --> 26:38.510
You know what?

26:39.645 --> 26:43.382
Maybe we shouldn't go
to Arizona together.

26:45.217 --> 26:46.584
Okay.

26:47.720 --> 26:49.587
Maybe you're right.

26:53.492 --> 26:55.527
I'm gonna go.

26:57.262 --> 26:59.564
You take care of yourself.

27:08.106 --> 27:10.908
Why wouldn't
you let me help you?

27:10.976 --> 27:13.411
I know you might not
understand this,

27:13.478 --> 27:17.113
but...

27:17.181 --> 27:20.250
I kept picturing us
ten years down the road,

27:20.284 --> 27:22.986
and...

27:23.054 --> 27:25.689
and I didn't like what I saw.

27:25.757 --> 27:26.990
What did you see?

27:27.024 --> 27:29.426
I saw me laying in that bed,

27:29.494 --> 27:32.529
you spoon feeding me
mashed potatoes.

27:35.232 --> 27:37.300
That's a load of crap.

27:37.335 --> 27:41.338
With all due respect,
you can't predict the future!

27:42.273 --> 27:43.594
How do you know
ten years from now

27:43.607 --> 27:45.741
that I'm not gonna need someone
to spoon feed me

27:45.776 --> 27:46.843
mashed potatoes?

27:46.877 --> 27:48.911
You're a lot younger
than me, Lis.

27:48.946 --> 27:50.680
Is that what all of this
has always been about?

27:50.714 --> 27:52.815
That you are trying to save me

27:52.850 --> 27:55.417
from a life
of taking care of you?

27:55.452 --> 27:57.186
I guess you could say that.

27:57.220 --> 27:59.455
It's honourable,

27:59.490 --> 28:01.591
but it's damn stupid!

28:01.625 --> 28:06.528
Don't you get it?
Don't you get that I was all in?

28:06.562 --> 28:09.198
I was all in
because I loved you,

28:09.232 --> 28:12.301
not because
I felt sorry for you.

28:12.335 --> 28:14.970
<i>But that's all just...</i>
<i>water under the bridge</i>

28:15.005 --> 28:17.006
because if loving each other
was enough,

28:17.040 --> 28:19.674
then...

28:19.709 --> 28:22.777
we'd still be together,
wouldn't we?

28:32.655 --> 28:33.822
For what it's worth,

28:33.856 --> 28:36.558
Arizona wasn't all
it's cracked up to be.

28:36.592 --> 28:38.393
Yeah? Too hot?

28:39.328 --> 28:40.761
No.

28:40.829 --> 28:42.397
Too lonely.

28:43.999 --> 28:48.636
I spent the whole time there
wishing you were with me.

28:48.703 --> 28:52.106
I'm just too damn stubborn
to pick up the phone

28:52.174 --> 28:54.909
and too damn stubborn
to say I'm sorry.

28:55.977 --> 28:57.878
<i>Jack?</i>

28:57.913 --> 28:59.479
Here!

29:01.449 --> 29:02.917
Ty!

29:02.984 --> 29:04.284
- Hey!
- Hey.

29:04.318 --> 29:05.986
We got here as
soon as we could.

29:06.021 --> 29:07.888
- Is everybody okay?
- Yeah, we're fine.

29:07.956 --> 29:10.624
Aren't you a
sight for sore eyes!

29:10.692 --> 29:12.725
Grandpa! Hey!

29:13.324 --> 29:15.004
Cinders has been
down there for hours.

29:15.029 --> 29:17.230
We really need to get him
out of there!

29:17.298 --> 29:18.665
So?

29:18.732 --> 29:20.333
Oh!

29:20.401 --> 29:21.768
Thank you!

29:32.913 --> 29:34.948
<i>Clover!</i>

29:36.650 --> 29:38.184
Clover!

29:38.251 --> 29:39.852
Oh!

29:39.920 --> 29:41.287
Clover?

29:43.156 --> 29:44.757
Hey, Georgie.

29:44.825 --> 29:45.991
I was just gonna go over
to the house

29:46.025 --> 29:47.460
to get something to drink,
did you wanna come?

29:47.527 --> 29:49.095
Have you seen Clover?

29:49.162 --> 29:51.863
Who's Clover?
My lamb.

29:51.931 --> 29:53.299
Is he a little lamb?

29:53.366 --> 29:55.101
Yes!

29:55.168 --> 29:57.736
Is his fleece as white as snow?

29:57.804 --> 29:59.037
Have you seen him or not?

29:59.106 --> 30:00.206
Last time I checked,
he was in the chicken Coop

30:00.273 --> 30:01.607
and now he's gone!

30:01.641 --> 30:03.909
There is no way
he could've escaped!

30:05.044 --> 30:06.812
Okay, relax.
Don't have an aneurysm.

30:06.879 --> 30:08.413
Yeah, I saw him.

30:08.447 --> 30:10.215
Where? Tim put him in
the back of the truck

30:10.249 --> 30:12.584
with the rest of the lambs.

30:12.619 --> 30:13.919
What?!

30:29.101 --> 30:30.668
That should do it!

30:31.604 --> 30:33.871
- Okay!
- You ready, Cinders?

30:33.905 --> 30:35.139
You ready?

30:35.206 --> 30:38.876
We're gonna get you out of here,
come on.

30:39.811 --> 30:42.713
It's okay, come on.
Good boy!

30:46.718 --> 30:48.519
Good boy, good boy.

30:48.553 --> 30:49.820
All right. I'm just
gonna check him out

30:49.855 --> 30:51.588
for a second here.

30:55.593 --> 30:58.195
All right, he's good to go.

30:58.229 --> 30:59.329
Well then,

30:59.364 --> 31:01.265
what do y'all say
we get out of here?

31:01.299 --> 31:03.433
I think that's the best idea
I've heard all day!

31:05.303 --> 31:06.570
Good boy!

31:10.107 --> 31:13.342
Tim, call me back as
soon as you get this message!

31:13.377 --> 31:14.678
You took Clover by mistake!

31:14.712 --> 31:16.612
Please don't sell him!

31:16.647 --> 31:18.882
If you don't bring him back,
Olivia's going to kill me!

31:18.916 --> 31:22.585
I already lost him once,
I can't lose him again!

31:22.619 --> 31:24.587
So please, call me!

31:32.162 --> 31:33.862
Hey, Clover.

31:34.831 --> 31:37.233
Hey, how you doing, buddy?

31:37.267 --> 31:38.601
How you doing?

31:40.170 --> 31:41.937
I got something for you.

31:42.906 --> 31:45.107
Here, try this.

31:45.141 --> 31:47.008
Come on.

31:47.076 --> 31:49.143
You are so cute!

31:58.253 --> 32:01.388
It's okay. Come on, Cinders,
you're all right!

32:03.791 --> 32:06.093
Hey, you're all right,
let's go!

32:06.127 --> 32:07.561
Come on!

32:08.763 --> 32:10.464
Cinders!

32:11.733 --> 32:14.034
I thought we dealt
with the water issue.

32:14.102 --> 32:16.437
Yeah, so did I.

32:16.471 --> 32:18.272
You don't wanna cross
the stream, do you?

32:18.340 --> 32:19.906
Well, he's been
under a lot of stress.

32:19.941 --> 32:22.508
It might've set him back a bit.

32:22.576 --> 32:23.610
I don't think we
should force him across.

32:23.677 --> 32:25.846
He's been through
so much today.

32:25.913 --> 32:27.781
I don't think we need
to force him.

32:27.849 --> 32:29.415
I think he'll follow you.

32:29.483 --> 32:31.051
Really?
Yeah.

32:31.119 --> 32:32.285
Yeah, you've spent all day
with him

32:32.353 --> 32:34.654
and he trusts you.

32:34.688 --> 32:36.156
Okay.

32:36.224 --> 32:37.184
Wanna walk me through it?

32:37.224 --> 32:38.591
Of course.

32:41.762 --> 32:43.663
Okay, Cinders.

32:43.731 --> 32:46.499
You and me, all right?

32:46.567 --> 32:48.067
Gonna cross there?

32:48.135 --> 32:50.403
Okay, now, walk forward.

32:51.338 --> 32:52.639
Whoa.

32:53.573 --> 32:55.053
That's good, and
stop right there.

32:55.075 --> 32:58.844
But don't turn back to him,
just let him come to you, okay?

33:18.831 --> 33:20.865
Come on.

33:22.001 --> 33:23.368
Good boy!

33:25.037 --> 33:26.437
Good boy!

33:33.679 --> 33:35.079
Good boy!

33:36.381 --> 33:38.716
There you go!

33:42.018 --> 33:44.686
<i>Hey, any luck</i>
<i>tracking down Tim?</i>

33:44.721 --> 33:45.988
No.

33:46.022 --> 33:48.657
It's probably too late,
anyways.

33:48.691 --> 33:49.758
Clover is gone,

33:49.792 --> 33:51.760
and I have no one to blame
but myself.

33:53.396 --> 33:55.330
Follow me, kid.

33:55.364 --> 33:56.464
Why?

33:56.499 --> 33:57.632
I got something to show you.

33:57.666 --> 33:59.901
Trust me,
you're gonna want to see it.

33:59.935 --> 34:01.669
Come on!

34:04.806 --> 34:06.541
<i>You can stop whining</i>
<i>about Clover now.</i>

34:06.575 --> 34:09.010
<i>He's right here,</i>
<i>safe and sound.</i>

34:09.045 --> 34:11.079
What? How'd
he get up in the loft?

34:11.112 --> 34:12.279
I hid him.

34:12.313 --> 34:13.614
Maybe you should
think about that

34:13.649 --> 34:17.184
next time you're accusing
innocent people of stealing!

34:17.217 --> 34:18.619
So where is he?

34:18.654 --> 34:21.121
Over there, behind those bales.

34:24.059 --> 34:25.793
Well, I don't see him.

34:26.995 --> 34:29.996
What do you mean,
he's right... there.

34:33.134 --> 34:36.803
Jade, this isn't funny!
Where's Clover?

34:36.837 --> 34:39.672
He was right here, I swear!

34:39.739 --> 34:42.543
Clover!
Come here, boy!

34:42.577 --> 34:44.445
I don't understand!

34:44.478 --> 34:46.279
What is there to understand?!

34:46.346 --> 34:48.181
He escaped!

34:48.215 --> 34:50.617
You have to find him, quick,
before the coyotes get him!

34:50.650 --> 34:52.686
<i>The coyotes?</i>

34:53.721 --> 34:55.589
Clover!

34:55.623 --> 34:57.056
Come here, boy!

34:57.959 --> 34:59.192
Clover!

35:08.902 --> 35:11.471
Thank you for everything,
I mean it.

35:11.538 --> 35:12.905
I was glad to help.

35:12.973 --> 35:15.641
But I do think it's a shame
that you're selling Cinders.

35:15.709 --> 35:17.110
You two have a real connection.

35:17.144 --> 35:19.344
Oh, I don't know.
I do. Why do you think he followed you

35:19.412 --> 35:20.746
through the river?

35:20.780 --> 35:23.882
Well, I don't even know if
I'm gonna be able to keep him.

35:23.917 --> 35:26.085
I'm about to accept an offer
on Fairfield.

35:26.119 --> 35:27.620
So you are leaving.

35:27.687 --> 35:29.387
Yeah.

35:29.455 --> 35:30.756
That's too bad.

35:30.790 --> 35:31.757
You know, you've spent
all this time

35:31.791 --> 35:33.525
building a relationship.

35:33.593 --> 35:36.661
It'd be a shame
to just let that go.

35:36.729 --> 35:38.663
Amy, why do I get the sense

35:38.731 --> 35:42.367
you're not talking
about Cinders?

35:55.714 --> 35:58.683
You know I love you, Lisa.

36:00.986 --> 36:04.722
I probably don't show you
that enough.

36:07.859 --> 36:09.926
I love you, too.

36:12.597 --> 36:16.933
I love...
I love us together.

36:16.968 --> 36:19.036
So do I.

36:19.103 --> 36:22.139
I love the life
that we have together.

36:32.050 --> 36:35.919
Georgie, I am so sorry!
I can't find Clover anywhere!

36:35.953 --> 36:39.589
It was just supposed to be
a stupid joke.

36:39.623 --> 36:41.691
I never meant
to kill your lamb!

36:43.727 --> 36:47.463
Well, there is one place
you didn't look.

36:49.466 --> 36:51.534
Come with me, "kid."

36:55.372 --> 36:58.373
Oh, gross!
Are you serious?

37:00.877 --> 37:03.813
Clover!
Oh my God, you're okay!

37:03.847 --> 37:05.014
How did he get in here?

37:05.048 --> 37:07.549
Well, I put him there.
What?!

37:07.584 --> 37:09.318
Well, it didn't take me
that long to figure out

37:09.352 --> 37:10.986
you were hiding him.

37:11.021 --> 37:14.656
So I thought it was your turn
to learn a lesson.

37:14.691 --> 37:15.824
You're evil!

37:15.891 --> 37:18.059
You had me convinced
I killed a little lamb!

37:18.094 --> 37:21.496
Sorry! I didn't know
you'd get so upset!

37:25.000 --> 37:26.401
High five.

37:26.436 --> 37:28.837
What?
I said, high five!

37:28.871 --> 37:30.872
Oh...

37:30.940 --> 37:32.607
Great job, kiddo!

37:32.641 --> 37:35.943
You're not nearly as uncool
as I thought you were.

37:35.977 --> 37:38.145
Clover!

37:38.179 --> 37:40.347
Cutie! Aww!
Look at you!

37:45.053 --> 37:47.821
<i>Oh! Stop the truck!
Stop the truck!</i>

37:48.757 --> 37:50.190
Why, what's wrong?

37:50.225 --> 37:53.560
I just finally have a signal
and I don't wanna lose it.

37:53.628 --> 37:55.128
I hope I'm not too late
to accept that offer

37:55.162 --> 37:56.730
on Fairfield.

37:57.898 --> 38:01.568
Oh, shoot!
I'm losing the signal.

38:02.836 --> 38:04.604
Oh!

38:06.574 --> 38:07.974
Come on!

38:09.376 --> 38:10.643
Come on!

38:10.677 --> 38:12.611
Lisa, this is crazy!

38:14.982 --> 38:16.382
I have half a bar.

38:16.449 --> 38:19.551
Just wait 'til we get
back to town.

38:19.619 --> 38:21.654
Oh, good!
There's a full bar.

38:23.757 --> 38:26.191
There, it's ringing!

38:30.497 --> 38:32.731
What are you doing?

38:32.799 --> 38:35.501
I don't want you to sell.

38:37.437 --> 38:39.471
Just hear me out.

38:42.408 --> 38:45.277
Maybe it is enough.

38:45.344 --> 38:46.511
What is?

38:46.578 --> 38:49.047
Earlier, you said...

38:49.115 --> 38:52.150
that loving each other
wasn't enough.

38:53.452 --> 38:55.486
But you're wrong.

38:56.856 --> 38:58.823
It is enough, Lis.

38:59.825 --> 39:01.859
I still love you,

39:01.927 --> 39:04.562
and I think you still love me.

39:04.630 --> 39:09.300
We just have to figure out
how our lives fit together.

39:09.368 --> 39:12.603
I don't know how
that's gonna work,

39:12.638 --> 39:15.706
only that I want it to...

39:17.075 --> 39:19.543
and I hope you do, too.

39:20.545 --> 39:22.779
So will you please...

39:22.848 --> 39:27.700
just... stay?

39:46.171 --> 39:48.839
Well, we
thought he was missing,

39:48.873 --> 39:52.309
um, but it turns out
that he was just hiding

39:52.344 --> 39:53.877
behind some hay bales.

39:53.911 --> 39:55.212
Right, Jade?

39:55.246 --> 39:57.547
