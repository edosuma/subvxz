00:16.480 --> 00:17.920
Say something.

00:20.720 --> 00:23.680
[sighs] Can we... Can we get out of here?

00:24.640 --> 00:26.200
I'll try and explain.

00:45.240 --> 00:48.440
- Is it much further?
- I don't recognize anything.

00:48.520 --> 00:50.080
I haven't been here since I was little.

00:50.160 --> 00:52.280
I cannot believe
Auntie Joan left it to me.

00:52.360 --> 00:54.280
It is such a beautiful cottage.

00:54.360 --> 00:56.480
No signal, ergo, no maps, y'all.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.440
Too many people rely on maps.

00:58.520 --> 01:01.200
Like, we should just trust our intuition
a bit more.

01:01.960 --> 01:04.640
- [Mal] No signal here either.
- Oh, bugger!

01:04.720 --> 01:05.720
I meant to call Helen.

01:05.800 --> 01:08.280
She would kill me if I don't check in,
with her bare hands.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.480
[chuckles] She really could.

01:10.560 --> 01:13.000
- Why didn't she come with us?
- Oh, she hates the countryside.

01:13.080 --> 01:15.400
She says, "Once you live in the city,
why go backwards?"

01:19.960 --> 01:21.280
Ooh, erm...

01:22.560 --> 01:24.480
Well, it's definitely smaller
than I remember.

01:27.800 --> 01:28.920
[Luke] Hmm...

01:29.800 --> 01:31.160
Anything else different?

01:32.120 --> 01:34.440
[mumbles quietly]

01:35.760 --> 01:38.040
Well, it's a beautiful view.

01:38.120 --> 01:39.600
We could grab some firewood,

01:39.680 --> 01:41.720
set up with a few drinks,
make a night of it.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.240
[laughing] Yeah!

01:43.320 --> 01:46.760
Or we could check into the nearest
boutique hotel for a hot stone massage.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.680
Come on, Luke. We'll drink till it
feels like we're sitting on chairs.

01:49.760 --> 01:51.720
Yeah, and we can sleep
on the planet's surface,

01:51.800 --> 01:53.280
like we do every night.

01:55.120 --> 01:56.560
I'm sorry, what now?

01:56.640 --> 01:59.680
Just the spectacle of you having to go
without your creature comforts.

01:59.760 --> 02:01.200
What is that supposed to mean?

02:01.280 --> 02:03.640
You're the only guy I know
that wears more than one moisturizer.

02:03.720 --> 02:07.680
Er, no, I wear one moisturizer,
one advanced cell-structure buffer,

02:07.760 --> 02:10.800
and one post-shave hydrator.
That's three lots of ones, so...

02:10.880 --> 02:12.680
[Mal] Looks like some old tarpaulin
over there we could use.

02:12.760 --> 02:13.760
All right. That's settled.

02:13.840 --> 02:15.320
Me and Frankie will go into town
and get extras.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.040
Ooh, I'll come, too.
Get some signal to call Helen.

02:18.120 --> 02:20.840
Oh, Dyl, could you help me
get the tarp out the back?

02:24.200 --> 02:26.960
- Hello.
- [Luke] Here they are.

02:27.040 --> 02:29.280
- Right, who wants a drink?
- Sounds good.

02:29.360 --> 02:32.640
Can't. Off the booze.
Got to keep my sperm quality up.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.440
Why don't we do some mushrooms instead?

02:34.520 --> 02:36.840
You do know that alcohol
is actually fruit that's rotted.

02:36.920 --> 02:40.360
- Like... like, these are fresh.
- They're the healthy choice!

02:40.440 --> 02:43.560
[inhales sharply] No, thanks.
I'm, er... I'm watching my weight.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.360
Hmm?

02:48.120 --> 02:49.480
[chuckles nervously]

02:53.200 --> 02:57.000
[Evie] Can I ask,
is everything okay between us?

02:57.080 --> 02:58.640
[Dylan] Yeah, of course. Why?

02:58.720 --> 03:02.360
[chuckles] Because ever since
that girl's party when we...

03:02.720 --> 03:03.800
you know...

03:04.640 --> 03:06.520
I don't know, it feels...

03:06.600 --> 03:09.160
feels like things are a bit off
with you in general.

03:10.200 --> 03:12.440
I mean, what's Frankie about?

03:12.520 --> 03:14.840
I think she's about 21.

03:14.920 --> 03:17.200
Well, she doesn't really
seem to be your type.

03:17.280 --> 03:21.240
Well, my type's been a disaster,
and I don't...

03:21.320 --> 03:22.800
I don't have to think about Frankie,

03:22.880 --> 03:25.400
so that just...
That seems easier.

03:27.880 --> 03:30.080
[Evie] Easier than being yourself?

03:30.160 --> 03:32.400
Yep, that's the idea.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.000
I don't know.
I think that's kind of sad.

03:36.320 --> 03:38.080
I like your old self.

03:38.160 --> 03:39.240
I sort of...

03:40.200 --> 03:41.800
loved those things about you.

03:41.880 --> 03:45.920
And... I know things move on,
that's fine, but...

03:48.200 --> 03:50.360
Well, don't get rid
of all your good things.

03:53.160 --> 03:54.800
[scoffs] I...

03:56.160 --> 03:58.840
I think what you're saying is
you think I should propose to Frankie.

03:58.920 --> 04:01.160
[Evie laughs] Yeah.

04:02.120 --> 04:04.480
[Frankie] What's so important
about calling your wife?

04:04.560 --> 04:07.320
[Angus] I have to check in,
in case her internal temperature changes.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.080
We're trying for a baby.

04:09.160 --> 04:11.280
Oh, I had a bar!
We should reverse and try find it.

04:11.360 --> 04:13.360
- We'll be in town soon.
- No, no, but it was a bar!

04:13.440 --> 04:15.840
A delicious bar of signal! [Laughing]

04:16.440 --> 04:18.519
- Everything all right there?
- [laughing]

04:18.600 --> 04:21.320
- He's probably hallucinating.
- [Dylan] Why would that be happening?

04:21.399 --> 04:23.080
- I gave him some mushrooms.
- [Angus] Ooh.

04:23.160 --> 04:24.520
- They're perfectly healthy!
- [laughing]

04:24.600 --> 04:26.280
Frankie said
they won't affect my sperm.

04:26.360 --> 04:27.960
[Angus continues laughing]

04:28.800 --> 04:30.640
[Evie sighs] What's the plan?

04:30.720 --> 04:34.120
Plan is I'm gonna build a fire...
right here.

04:34.200 --> 04:37.680
- Are you sure that's a good idea?
- Why would it not be a good...

04:38.240 --> 04:40.640
I can build a goddamn fire, lady,
all right?

04:40.720 --> 04:42.480
Just because I take care
of my beautiful skin...

04:42.560 --> 04:44.760
- I'm not saying that, Luke. I'm not...
- Shh!

04:44.840 --> 04:46.440
I don't need advice, all right?

04:46.520 --> 04:48.080
I need big logs and a lot of leaves.

04:48.160 --> 04:50.760
Don't want to rain on your parade,
but big logs and leaves...

04:50.840 --> 04:52.360
Leaves will be damp
this time of year

04:52.440 --> 04:54.680
and the logs won't catch
without a shit-ton of kindling.

04:54.760 --> 04:56.000
Okay, well, that's your opinion.

04:56.080 --> 04:59.520
It's also how logs, leaves,
and twigs and fire work?

04:59.600 --> 05:01.680
[grunting] Er, I think I'll be fine.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.320
Well, I'm just gonna
start working the shelter then,

05:04.400 --> 05:06.200
and possibly a small backup fire?

05:06.280 --> 05:08.440
- You know, just in case.
- [chuckles]

05:10.600 --> 05:12.320
Okay, well, uh, anyone need my help?

05:12.400 --> 05:14.000
[Luke and Mal] Not me!

05:16.280 --> 05:19.600
Found one! Straight off the bat.
Massive twig.

05:20.680 --> 05:24.440
- Have you done mushrooms before?
- [laughing] I'm not a five-year-old child.

05:24.520 --> 05:25.720
No, I haven't done them before.

05:25.800 --> 05:28.080
[Frankie] Look, just mellow out
and ingest them.

05:28.160 --> 05:29.400
I'm being sensual, okay?

05:29.480 --> 05:30.960
- Let me feed you.
- I'm driving!

05:31.040 --> 05:33.680
You can do both. It's called multitasking.
Women do it all the time.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.960
What, start tripping at 50 miles per hour?

05:36.040 --> 05:37.360
- Come on.
- Frankie, fuck off!

05:39.680 --> 05:41.400
[muffled giggling]

05:41.480 --> 05:44.520
Oh, a bar! A bar!
[groans] It's gone.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.240
[blows]

05:48.200 --> 05:50.280
Fuck you, Bear Grylls.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.960
Hey, this isn't exactly what I had in mind
for this weekend.

05:56.040 --> 05:59.520
I wanted us to do stuff together.
Us... and Mal.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.120
What? Why?

06:01.200 --> 06:04.120
Because we've been going out for a year
and you barely know him.

06:04.200 --> 06:05.520
[sighs] Not true at all.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.120
- [Luke exhales heavily]
- [Evie] Oh?

06:07.200 --> 06:08.480
What's his surname?

06:09.320 --> 06:10.440
[scoffs]

06:10.520 --> 06:12.800
- Only old people use surnames.
- Luke.

06:13.560 --> 06:15.360
I know Mal is a nice guy, all right?

06:15.440 --> 06:16.720
Yeah, he's a lot more than that.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.840
It would mean a lot
if you made more of an effort.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.120
[sighs]

06:23.120 --> 06:24.400
Fine, we'll combine forces.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.400
But to be clear, I'm doing this for you,

06:26.480 --> 06:28.200
and not because this fire
hasn't lit yet.

06:28.760 --> 06:29.800
It's gonna be glorious.

06:30.800 --> 06:33.160
Yeah, yeah, it looks... looks great.

06:33.640 --> 06:36.320
[Frankie] I thought you were supposed
to be this cool, older guy,

06:36.400 --> 06:38.880
but it turns out
you're just old and judgmental.

06:38.960 --> 06:41.400
- I'm sorry I let you down.
- I think she's talking to me.

06:41.480 --> 06:43.000
Are you gonna do the shrooms or not?

06:43.080 --> 06:45.120
I need to reconsider
what I'm doing with my life.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.240
You should become a vet!

06:46.320 --> 06:47.560
- Whole thing was a mistake.
- Or a pilot!

06:47.640 --> 06:49.360
- Make him stop.
- Why can't I stop?

06:49.440 --> 06:51.520
- 'Cause you're off your face.
- Am I? Oh, am I?

06:51.600 --> 06:52.680
Oh, shit, guys, am I?

06:52.760 --> 06:55.080
Just two or three, okay?
So we're on the same frequency.

06:55.160 --> 06:56.280
[spits] No!

06:56.360 --> 06:57.880
Oh, my God!
You're being an asshole!

06:57.960 --> 06:59.600
- [Dylan] I can't do this anymore.
- Ooh!

06:59.680 --> 07:01.480
It was meant to be easy,
and it's really not.

07:01.560 --> 07:04.080
Let me out. Seriously, let me out!
Drop me at a bus stop!

07:04.160 --> 07:06.120
- We all getting on a bus?
- We are breaking up.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.560
What?
But you guys are brilliant together!

07:09.880 --> 07:11.880
- [rock music playing on radio]
- Yeah!

07:22.480 --> 07:24.000
[indistinct chatter]

07:24.880 --> 07:27.080
Sweet mother of God, that's a fine blaze.

07:27.160 --> 07:31.120
All the bits you want to be on fire
are all just basically on fire.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.680
Making fires that burn.

07:32.760 --> 07:35.400
We had an actual lecture on it
in the army. [Chuckles]

07:35.480 --> 07:37.520
[chuckling] Very good. Good.

07:37.600 --> 07:40.120
No, I'm serious.
I was in the army for four years.

07:42.520 --> 07:43.520
What?

07:43.600 --> 07:46.360
Surely you knew that.
I have told you that before, Luke.

07:46.440 --> 07:48.280
No offense, Evie,
but sometimes when you talk,

07:48.360 --> 07:51.120
it's like having the radio on.
It's lovely, comforting background noise

07:51.200 --> 07:53.080
that I don't feel
obliged to concentrate on.

07:53.160 --> 07:55.880
- Thank God he said "no offense."
- You was in the real, actual army?

07:55.960 --> 07:57.320
Affirmative.

07:57.400 --> 08:00.120
- [laughs] That's army speak for "yes."
- Oh.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.680
Okay, tell me.
How much you bench, guy?

08:05.040 --> 08:07.080
- Quite a lot.
- Looks like it, yeah.

08:07.160 --> 08:08.640
Mind if I have a squizz on the guns?

08:08.720 --> 08:10.240
It might be fairly weird... Okay!

08:10.320 --> 08:12.920
[gasping] Oh!
Christ, that's a tight wad!

08:13.000 --> 08:14.480
Okay, I'm gonna go get some more wood.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.680
Can't believe you didn't tell me
about this, Evie.

08:17.360 --> 08:21.120
So what's the secret, Malcolm?
Eat clean, train dirty, yeah? [Sniffs]

08:21.680 --> 08:22.840
Do you mind if I grab a pec?

08:22.920 --> 08:24.960
- [stammers] I would mind.
- Okay, okay.

08:28.160 --> 08:30.360
Helen?
Yes! Strong signal!

08:30.920 --> 08:32.200
How's your temperature?

08:32.919 --> 08:37.480
Sure? Sure? Sure? Okay.

08:39.799 --> 08:40.919
Could you check she's gone?

08:41.880 --> 08:42.960
So do you have to go back?

08:43.039 --> 08:45.520
Don't know. [Grunts] Forgot to ask.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.240
Look, I don't think I can now, can I?

08:47.320 --> 08:50.280
- [music playing in passing car]
- Whoo!

08:50.360 --> 08:52.280
[vocalizing]

08:52.360 --> 08:54.640
Definitely not. Let's pack you up.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.240
[muffled laughing]

09:18.120 --> 09:19.680
You'll die if you stay in there.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.840
It's like being in winter
inside a bit of furniture.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.720
[gasps] It's like Narnia!

09:23.800 --> 09:26.760
- You're crushing their oven chips.
- No, come on. Get in.

09:26.840 --> 09:29.920
It was roasting out there, but in here,
my buttocks have gone completely numb,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.160
but my nipples feel very nice indeed.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
I'm not coming on to you.

09:35.320 --> 09:36.160
Okay.

09:36.240 --> 09:39.320
No, no, I just realized I was talking
about my buttocks and my nip-nips.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.040
It sounded like
I was coming on to you,

09:41.120 --> 09:43.400
but I'm just naming bits of me
that are cold.

09:43.480 --> 09:45.120
You could get out of the freezer.

09:45.200 --> 09:46.200
No.

09:47.760 --> 09:50.200
Could you get out of the freezer, please?

09:51.520 --> 09:52.880
I can still see you.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.640
We've been watching you on the CCTV.

09:56.720 --> 10:00.240
So pay for your stuff and leave,
or I call the police.

10:01.640 --> 10:03.320
[whispers] What do you think we should do?

10:13.480 --> 10:15.080
Stick of gum?

10:27.400 --> 10:28.680
That's good gum.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.280
Ice cool, right? [Chuckles]

10:32.000 --> 10:34.640
[Evie chuckles]
What are you guys doing up there?

10:34.720 --> 10:36.320
Waterproofing the roof.

10:37.040 --> 10:40.600
Evie, Mal's gonna build his own house
one day from scratch.

10:40.680 --> 10:42.920
- You know what scratch is?
- Really?

10:43.000 --> 10:46.120
Scratch is from nothing!
He's gonna build it with his bare hands.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.480
Sort of a dream of mine.

10:47.560 --> 10:50.480
- Hmm. Didn't know that.
- Build a house, fill it with kids.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.080
- Oh, right.
- [Luke] Roger that, skip.

10:58.600 --> 10:59.640
[chuckles]

11:00.680 --> 11:01.960
Ooh, cripes.

11:02.040 --> 11:03.800
I ate quite a lot
of dried fruit in the car,

11:03.880 --> 11:06.120
and now I need what the French call
un shit très grand.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.320
How many kids?

11:07.400 --> 11:09.120
- Where'd you say the toilet was?
- There isn't one.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.760
When you say "fill the house with kids..."

11:11.840 --> 11:13.120
how many is "full"? [Chuckles]

11:13.200 --> 11:14.800
- The toilet, Evie?
- There isn't one.

11:14.880 --> 11:16.720
Three, maybe four?

11:16.800 --> 11:18.520
Earlier you said you used the ladies'...

11:18.600 --> 11:20.520
Yeah, as in, I went behind a log. Er...

11:20.600 --> 11:22.520
Four's quite a lot of kids. [Chuckles]

11:22.600 --> 11:26.000
Look, can we please stop talking about
having a family, guys? This is serious!

11:26.080 --> 11:29.120
I can't shit outdoors, all right?
I'm a three-ply kind of guy.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.960
A flushing toilet is essential.
I'm not compromising on that.

11:32.040 --> 11:35.000
- Not compromising with who?
- Well, what am I supposed to do?

11:35.080 --> 11:36.320
- [groans]
- [sighs]

11:37.960 --> 11:41.080
[groans] I am not taking a shit
on that shovel, Evie.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.040
- [sighs] Dig a hole.
- Dig a... [gasps]

11:43.120 --> 11:44.600
That's barbaric!

11:44.920 --> 11:48.360
Letting fly in nature
is a pretty liberating experience.

11:48.440 --> 11:50.040
Trust me, it's a beautiful thing.

11:52.440 --> 11:53.760
I'm going to find a toilet.

11:56.520 --> 11:59.480
[stammers] I'll come with you!

11:59.560 --> 12:01.200
I need to use the toilet as well.

12:02.240 --> 12:03.560
Wait, Luke!

12:12.400 --> 12:17.240
Angus, if a girl you've been maybe
sort of suppressing feelings for...

12:17.320 --> 12:22.400
If she turned around and told you
that she once loved you,

12:22.480 --> 12:26.360
and for being the best version
of yourself, would you...

12:27.440 --> 12:28.840
I mean, should I...

12:28.920 --> 12:30.200
Stop.

12:30.280 --> 12:33.040
You've completely lost me.
I need one-word questions.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.800
Come on. We need to get back.

12:36.880 --> 12:39.560
[panting] Er, does four
sound like a lot to you?

12:39.640 --> 12:41.840
I don't have time for this.
I've gotta find a toilet.

12:41.920 --> 12:44.120
Did he mention how soon
he thought this needed to happen?

12:44.200 --> 12:45.680
What is the big deal?

12:45.760 --> 12:49.000
He's a great guy! He loves you!
He wants a future with you!

12:49.080 --> 12:51.800
Some of us have got real problems! [Gasps]

12:58.720 --> 13:00.000
[laughs]

13:00.680 --> 13:01.680
Shit! Oh, my God!

13:01.760 --> 13:03.080
- What?
- Where's Frankie?

13:03.160 --> 13:05.720
She went home on a bus.
Ages ago.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.600
Oh, right.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.480
What do you think that man
in the supermarket meant

13:09.560 --> 13:11.640
- when he said "we've been watching you"?
- [thumping]

13:11.720 --> 13:13.080
- Oh, Richard!
- [brakes screeching]

13:17.480 --> 13:19.640
- Who's Richard?
- I don't know. I panicked.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.040
[groans]

13:24.120 --> 13:26.200
[sighs] Shit.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.920
[panting] Anything I can help with?

13:30.760 --> 13:32.560
Just think that through.
At this moment,

13:32.640 --> 13:36.360
is there literally anything
you could help anyone with?

13:37.360 --> 13:38.200
No.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.520
[whistling]

13:43.560 --> 13:44.880
What's with the whistling?

13:44.960 --> 13:48.000
I'm being nonchalant.
I don't want anyone to know I'm tripping.

13:48.560 --> 13:49.840
I'm the only person here.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.520
We were told we were being watched.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.680
That was in the supermarket,
and it was specifically

13:53.760 --> 13:56.080
'cause you got
into their frozen vegetables.

13:56.160 --> 13:58.040
Shit!
Do you think we can get this changed?

13:58.120 --> 13:59.800
The walk back's fucking miles.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.520
Wait! We have... Angus!

14:02.600 --> 14:04.360
Shit! Fuck!

14:06.120 --> 14:07.960
[muttering] Fuck, fuck, fuck.

14:08.040 --> 14:09.440
Angus!

14:09.520 --> 14:11.120
[continues muttering]

14:12.040 --> 14:13.240
[Dylan] Fucking idiot.

14:15.360 --> 14:17.840
Luke, where are you going? [Laughs]

14:17.920 --> 14:20.640
There is always a toilet
if you want one badly enough, Evie.

14:20.720 --> 14:21.720
There's nowhere.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.040
- You're gonna have to...
- [gasps]

14:24.120 --> 14:26.960
There's movement.
I'm out of time here. What do I do?

14:27.040 --> 14:28.440
You dig.

14:29.600 --> 14:30.600
Fuck!

14:31.680 --> 14:33.320
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Are you leaving?

14:33.920 --> 14:35.760
- Good luck.
- [scoffs]

14:58.000 --> 14:59.040
[gasps]

15:07.000 --> 15:08.480
[faint growling]

15:10.080 --> 15:11.960
[heart beating steadily]

15:18.680 --> 15:21.040
[gasps] My God.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.680
It's beautiful.

15:23.800 --> 15:25.440
[deer shrieks]

15:29.080 --> 15:30.680
[grunting]

15:30.760 --> 15:32.160
Angus!

15:35.480 --> 15:37.920
- Angus!
- [Angus whispers] Dylan.

15:39.560 --> 15:40.400
Angus.

15:41.080 --> 15:42.400
I'm up a tree.

15:45.480 --> 15:47.400
Sorry I abandoned you.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.840
- Successful trip?
- Didn't stick around to find out.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.560
I wanted to talk to you.

15:53.640 --> 15:56.120
- Me, too. I...
- [Luke] Thank you!

15:56.200 --> 15:58.400
Whoo!
[laughs] Poo-poo!

15:58.480 --> 15:59.920
[laughing]

16:00.000 --> 16:01.240
What for?

16:01.320 --> 16:04.120
Yesterday, I'd have refused, man.
I'd have tried to hold that sucker in,

16:04.200 --> 16:05.680
but you inspired me.

16:05.760 --> 16:08.040
You. It was...

16:08.120 --> 16:10.680
[exhales] beautiful.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.720
Did you manage to wash your hands?

16:13.800 --> 16:15.880
[exhales] No way.
I'm au naturel now, baby.

16:15.960 --> 16:18.000
- Okay, great.
- [sighs]

16:18.080 --> 16:19.360
Hands by your sides.

16:19.440 --> 16:23.120
This guy, Evie.
A motherfucking keeper! I'm just saying.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.400
I'm gonna head to the woods

16:24.480 --> 16:26.080
and build you both a special place
to take a shit.

16:27.240 --> 16:30.120
- I could use a hand finishing up...
- I've found my thing, Mal.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.560
Let me do this for you. [Sighs]

16:32.640 --> 16:36.280
- Look, will you please come down?
- [Angus] No, I think Helen's stalking me.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.360
- Shh!
- It's not her style to follow you.

16:38.440 --> 16:41.800
She'd just... she'd just walk up to you
and start shouting at you.

16:41.880 --> 16:43.760
Yeah, that's what she wants you to think.

16:43.840 --> 16:46.040
- Come down!
- Ooh! Hey, guys.

16:46.120 --> 16:48.800
- [gasps]
- I'm looking for trees with low branches.

16:48.880 --> 16:51.640
Somewhere you could sit
for like... ten, 12 minutes.

16:51.720 --> 16:54.600
I need to get Angus down from the tree,
and I need to see Evie.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.240
Oh, she's, er, she's back at the cottage.
What's the rush?

16:57.320 --> 17:00.280
I think... And I've been doing my best
not to look at this,

17:00.360 --> 17:02.320
but I think... I love her.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.400
Love-her-like-a-sister kind of love?

17:07.480 --> 17:08.800
No, the other kind.

17:08.880 --> 17:11.960
Look, I know...
I know that's a lot to take in, but...

17:12.040 --> 17:13.640
I think she might feel the same,

17:13.720 --> 17:15.440
or she used to. What?

17:15.520 --> 17:17.160
Nothing. No, nothing.

17:17.240 --> 17:18.599
- What?
- It's...

17:20.160 --> 17:21.960
She seems kind of happy with Mal, man.

17:22.599 --> 17:27.079
[scoffs] Since when do we care about Mal?
This is my life we're talking about.

17:27.160 --> 17:29.920
I've been walking around
with a stone in my throat,

17:30.000 --> 17:32.640
- and I think she's the reason why.
- Uh...

17:32.720 --> 17:35.000
- Do you think we should talk about it?
- No, no.

17:35.080 --> 17:36.120
I talk about everything.

17:36.200 --> 17:38.400
I never stop talking,
and it kills everything.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.040
[chuckling]

17:40.800 --> 17:42.480
Okay.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.200
Well, I'm here for you, whatever.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.280
Oh, dear.
Whoa! [Groans]

17:49.560 --> 17:50.840
I'm okay!

17:58.440 --> 18:00.040
Are you happy?

18:02.600 --> 18:03.680
I am.

18:03.760 --> 18:05.760
I think we'd last the winter here,
if we wanted.

18:05.840 --> 18:07.280
[both chuckle]

18:09.120 --> 18:10.320
Sorry about earlier.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.640
- I was just a bit thrown...
- No. No, no, it's not...

18:14.480 --> 18:15.840
Just 'cause I know what I want,

18:15.920 --> 18:18.960
it doesn't mean
you have to want those things, too.

18:19.040 --> 18:24.000
I want a life with you,
not to fit you into my idea of a life.

18:24.080 --> 18:27.080
And anyway, there's no pressure, 'cause...

18:27.160 --> 18:30.400
Well, if you say no,
I'm pretty sure Luke will say yes.

18:30.480 --> 18:32.280
[laughs]

18:38.840 --> 18:40.440
[both chuckle]

18:42.800 --> 18:44.280
Are you proposing to me?

18:44.360 --> 18:45.360
Maybe.

18:46.680 --> 18:48.840
Can I eat it or do I wear it for life?

18:48.920 --> 18:51.200
You don't think I'm being serious.

18:52.240 --> 18:55.000
Serious is not that commonplace with you.

18:57.240 --> 18:58.320
Well?

18:59.440 --> 19:01.240
Are you asking me to marry you?

19:07.960 --> 19:12.440
I think for a long time I've had
other people's ideas in my head...

19:14.080 --> 19:16.800
about what things are supposed to be.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.400
And I'm realizing that...

19:22.480 --> 19:26.000
none of them knew what the fuck
they were talking about.

19:29.040 --> 19:34.320
And so that leaves me,
and what I want and what I think...

19:39.520 --> 19:42.480
And I can see myself
growing old with your face.

19:44.040 --> 19:45.640
In your imaginary house.

19:45.720 --> 19:47.680
[both chuckle]

19:47.760 --> 19:48.760
I'm just...

19:49.800 --> 19:53.480
I'm just saying, if you were to ask me...

19:55.960 --> 19:58.280
I don't think I'd necessarily say no.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.400
Hey, guys!

20:40.280 --> 20:41.520
Where have you been?

20:43.440 --> 20:45.280
Caught these animals in the woods.

20:47.520 --> 20:48.920
Starting to worry about you.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.920
- Oh, where's Frankie?
- There's no more Frankie.

20:52.720 --> 20:55.200
Are you okay?
You look a bit bummed out.

20:55.280 --> 20:57.120
I'll just drink my way through it

20:57.200 --> 21:00.800
until the ground feels like an armchair.
Something like that.

21:03.160 --> 21:05.000
You think it's not a good sign
that my paranoia

21:05.080 --> 21:06.520
was bumping into my wife?

21:09.920 --> 21:11.400
I think maybe I should speak to her.

21:11.880 --> 21:13.560
[all] Yeah.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.760
Skoal?

21:14.840 --> 21:16.400
- [all chuckle]
- [Evie] Skoal!

21:16.480 --> 21:18.120
[all] Skoal!

21:19.040 --> 21:20.800
[birds chirping]

22:08.560 --> 22:11.200
I should have another go
at lighting that bad boy. It's freezing.

22:11.280 --> 22:13.720
[sighs] Evie's really happy, isn't she?

22:13.800 --> 22:16.800
[inhales deeply]
Talking about getting married.

22:16.880 --> 22:19.560
I mean... [sighs] fuck.

22:21.400 --> 22:22.960
I'm not gonna mess with that.

22:23.040 --> 22:25.800
I want her to be happy.
I really do.

22:29.120 --> 22:30.520
How badly do you love her?

22:30.600 --> 22:32.320
[breathes sharply]

22:32.400 --> 22:34.560
It'll change. It'll go.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.520
What if it doesn't, dude?

22:39.280 --> 22:40.520
It will.

22:41.640 --> 22:44.840
I've been in love...
quite a lot. [Chuckles]

22:44.920 --> 22:47.360
Believe me, it always goes.

22:48.720 --> 22:50.280
Has to.

23:09.560 --> 23:11.360
I'm not in love with you.

23:12.120 --> 23:15.400
I'm just...
I'm just doing what I always do.

23:15.480 --> 23:18.960
And I'm going to miss it being us
after you get married and...

23:20.080 --> 23:22.040
That's all.
That's... [chuckles softly]

23:23.320 --> 23:26.560
That's what I've been saying to Luke.
That's what Luke meant.

23:27.480 --> 23:30.440
Look, I don't know
where I'm headed and, um,

23:30.520 --> 23:33.840
I don't want to get lost without you
and be on my own.

23:33.920 --> 23:35.280
It's selfish. That's...

23:36.040 --> 23:37.640
That's how I love you.

23:40.480 --> 23:41.800
Say something.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.320
I get it. [Chuckles]

23:45.160 --> 23:47.360
Maybe you, me and Luke
should've got married. [Chuckles]

23:47.440 --> 23:50.520
[chuckles] We'd have spent our lives
doing Luke's laundry

23:50.600 --> 23:52.000
and making him packed lunches.

23:52.840 --> 23:54.520
Yeah, he really needs to eat healthier.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.200
Yeah. [Chuckles]

24:04.880 --> 24:06.160
The other thing with Luke is...

24:06.240 --> 24:07.560
Dylan.

24:09.640 --> 24:10.920
This is complicated.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.720
It's also really simple.

24:12.800 --> 24:14.720
You ask me what I want and...

24:16.440 --> 24:18.640
I want to be your best man.
I wanna...

24:19.680 --> 24:21.840
I wanna walk you up the aisle and...

24:23.160 --> 24:24.600
I want you to be happy...

24:25.320 --> 24:26.720
for the rest of your life.

24:27.640 --> 24:29.280
That matters to me.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.920
I want those things for you, too.

24:33.640 --> 24:34.920
Yeah, well...

24:36.000 --> 24:37.640
