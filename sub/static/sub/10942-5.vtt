00:02.206 --> 00:03.707
Peter! Yeah!

00:03.774 --> 00:05.341
<i>Hold on...</i>

00:05.409 --> 00:08.277
<i>Uh... no.</i>

00:08.345 --> 00:10.680
<i>No, she's out. Again.</i>

00:10.748 --> 00:12.148
Jack and I have been talking
for awhile

00:12.216 --> 00:14.117
about the possibility of...

00:14.184 --> 00:15.184
<i>My bringing another one</i>
<i>of my kids</i>

00:15.252 --> 00:16.184
<i>out here to the ranch</i>

00:16.253 --> 00:17.586
to work for the summer.

00:17.654 --> 00:19.187
You know what?

00:19.255 --> 00:21.289
I can't afford to run this place on my own.
Right.

00:21.357 --> 00:22.758
Congratulations, Lisa,

00:22.826 --> 00:24.326
you bought yourself
a dude ranch.

00:24.394 --> 00:25.961
I managed to score an invite

00:26.029 --> 00:27.963
to Soraya's party
tomorrow night.

00:28.031 --> 00:29.064
Who're you gonna take?

00:29.132 --> 00:30.533
I pick you.

00:30.600 --> 00:31.700
Me?

00:31.768 --> 00:33.601
Unless you have plans
with Chelsea?

00:33.669 --> 00:35.770
We kind of broke up.

<i>Mallory...</i>

00:37.640 --> 00:38.907
<i>Mallory:</i>
<i>Badger?</i>

00:38.974 --> 00:40.742

your new ranch hand.

00:56.558 --> 00:57.691
Ho, ho, ho...

00:59.594 --> 01:01.094
Don't even think about it.

01:01.162 --> 01:02.896
Dude, this yours?

01:02.964 --> 01:03.997
Yeah,

01:04.065 --> 01:05.197
and it's worth more
than your life.

01:05.265 --> 01:06.766
So keep your grubby hands
off it.

01:06.833 --> 01:08.067
I'm just looking.

01:08.134 --> 01:10.102
Yeah, well, the show's over.

01:10.170 --> 01:11.437
Okay?

01:11.504 --> 01:12.304
I need you to tack up
a couple of horses

01:12.372 --> 01:13.305
for me and Amy.

01:13.373 --> 01:14.707
Can you handle that?

01:14.775 --> 01:15.841
Wouldn't it be more fun
to take your girl for a rip

01:15.909 --> 01:17.777
on this bad boy?

01:17.844 --> 01:19.511
Or have you gone all cowboy
out here?

01:19.580 --> 01:22.080
If you wanna spend time
with a horse crazy girl,

01:22.147 --> 01:24.115
you'll learn to love
your trail rides.

01:28.253 --> 01:29.320
Okay.

01:37.963 --> 01:40.831
(Lever clunks,
metallic squeaking)

01:41.733 --> 01:43.634
Aw, who's this guy?

01:44.603 --> 01:45.769
<i>Scott:</i>
<i>His name's Avery.</i>

01:45.837 --> 01:47.738
He was part
of an abandoned herd.

01:47.806 --> 01:48.939
Look at how beat up he is.

01:49.007 --> 01:50.007
They probably had
to fight each other

01:50.075 --> 01:51.875
for every blade of grass.

01:51.943 --> 01:54.177
<i>Scott: Yeah, well, I'm trying</i>
<i>to find him a home,</i>

01:54.245 --> 01:56.213
but he's terrified
of other horses;

01:56.280 --> 01:58.315
blows up whenever
he even gets close to one.

01:58.382 --> 02:00.783
So where are you taking him?

02:01.752 --> 02:02.819
(Laughs)

02:04.455 --> 02:05.722
You knew as soon
as I saw that face

02:05.789 --> 02:07.357
I'd wanna work with him.

02:07.425 --> 02:10.226
Well, I thought you might
be interested this case.

02:10.293 --> 02:11.727
Okay...

02:11.794 --> 02:14.830
Come on, Avery.
You're comin' with me, bud.

02:14.897 --> 02:17.466
Oh, yes you are.
(Laughs)

02:19.736 --> 02:20.802
Oh.

02:23.173 --> 02:25.340
"Welcome mat is tacky.
Lisa."

02:26.275 --> 02:27.375
Tacky?

02:30.513 --> 02:31.579
Ugh...

02:34.350 --> 02:35.550
"Rethink colour."

02:35.618 --> 02:36.717
Oh please.

02:42.890 --> 02:44.891
"Too 19's."
Guess you'd know.

02:45.793 --> 02:48.195
(Vehicle rumbles up the drive)

02:52.467 --> 02:53.534
Peter?!

02:57.971 --> 02:59.004
Peter!

02:59.973 --> 03:01.674
Baby!

03:01.741 --> 03:04.210
Oh my God, I missed you.

03:05.145 --> 03:06.412
Really?

03:06.480 --> 03:09.882
Then what're you still
doing here?

03:11.117 --> 03:13.085
(Horses whinny and snuffle)

03:13.153 --> 03:15.053
Ty: So what's with that horse
Scott dropped off?

03:15.120 --> 03:16.655
Amy: It's actually
a pretty sad story.

03:16.722 --> 03:19.291
His owners just up and left him
in the middle of winter.

03:19.358 --> 03:20.492
What the hell?

03:20.560 --> 03:21.593
Yeah, I know,
I can't believe...

03:21.661 --> 03:23.461
No, look.

03:23.529 --> 03:25.096
Amy:
Awww! (Titters)

03:25.164 --> 03:26.631
A little donkey.

03:26.699 --> 03:29.100
This place is pretty off
the beaten path.

03:29.168 --> 03:30.701
Yeah,
it's Sarah craven's place.

03:30.768 --> 03:32.503
<i>She's kinda the town hermit.</i>

03:32.571 --> 03:33.770
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>go back to your house.</i>

03:49.253 --> 03:50.653
Ty:
Here you go, buddy.

03:50.721 --> 03:52.288
Amy:
(Laughs) I better tell her he's loose.

03:52.356 --> 03:54.757
(Horse whinnies)

04:02.765 --> 04:04.433

04:15.378 --> 04:16.478
Poor guy.

04:19.047 --> 04:20.113
Look at these sores.

04:20.180 --> 04:21.716
He must be in a lot of pain.

04:22.751 --> 04:23.784
<i>Sarah:</i>
<i>Hey! (Gun cocks)</i>

04:25.086 --> 04:27.154

of falcon here

05:28.680 --> 05:30.447
for over 20 years

05:30.515 --> 05:32.148
and doing a pretty
damn good job of it.

05:32.216 --> 05:34.751
Now get off my property.

I did call. I called several times!

05:50.767 --> 05:52.000
In the middle of the night,
Lou.

05:52.068 --> 05:53.702
I feel like I'm married
to my voice mail here.

05:53.769 --> 05:55.770
What's going on?

05:55.838 --> 05:57.271
It's the dude ranch, okay?

05:57.340 --> 05:59.307
It's in shambles.

06:00.776 --> 06:01.710
Looks fine to me.

06:01.777 --> 06:03.378
Yeah, it does now...

06:03.446 --> 06:05.213
But I spent the last few weeks
getting it back on its feet.

06:05.280 --> 06:06.848
You should've seen it.

06:06.915 --> 06:08.082
How would you feel
if you came home

06:08.150 --> 06:09.550
and you found your business
was in trouble.

06:09.617 --> 06:11.719
I would've called you, Lou,

06:11.786 --> 06:12.953
and told you
what was happening.

06:13.020 --> 06:14.355
You know, involved you
with my decisions,

06:14.422 --> 06:15.589
that's what I would've done.

06:15.657 --> 06:18.692
Oh, yeah, like you did
with Dubai.

06:19.627 --> 06:21.895
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry, I didn't...

06:21.963 --> 06:24.264
I thought it was only gonna be
a few of days, okay?

06:24.332 --> 06:25.732
But it got complicated.

06:25.799 --> 06:28.368
And Lisa bought out my dad,
so she's my partner now.

06:28.435 --> 06:29.836
Lisa.
Yeah.

06:29.903 --> 06:31.103
So that's great!

06:31.171 --> 06:32.004
She's the perfect person
to run this place.

06:32.072 --> 06:33.439
Yes, exactly!

06:33.507 --> 06:34.474
So, great, can we go home now?

06:34.541 --> 06:36.976
Yes... soon.

06:38.011 --> 06:39.645
I just...
Lisa has some big ideas

06:39.713 --> 06:41.747
I'm not too keen on
and I want...

06:41.814 --> 06:43.715
You know, it's just gonna
take some time.

06:43.783 --> 06:45.450
How much time?
I don't know.

06:45.518 --> 06:46.852
A few weeks.
A month.

06:46.919 --> 06:48.420
A month?
Maybe.

06:49.355 --> 06:51.723
Lisa and I, we have to get on
the same page.

06:51.791 --> 06:53.592
Yeah, so do we.

07:00.899 --> 07:03.501
Ah, looks like Roy Rogers
found himself a sidekick.

07:05.804 --> 07:07.638
Hey, Mallory.

07:07.706 --> 07:09.172
Jamie?

07:09.240 --> 07:11.909
Since when does Jake
hang out with Jamie?

07:11.976 --> 07:14.010
Sounds like he's a real playa.

07:14.077 --> 07:15.412
<i>Jake:</i>
<i>We're goin' on a trail ride.</i>

07:15.479 --> 07:16.613
You wanna come?

07:16.680 --> 07:18.915
We know you're probably
too busy, but...

07:18.982 --> 07:20.650
Actually, it sounds fun.
So, yeah.

07:20.718 --> 07:21.918
Cool.

07:21.985 --> 07:23.520
Jamie:
How about your hired hand?

07:23.587 --> 07:25.922
Maybe he wants
to come along too.

07:25.989 --> 07:27.690
Uh... no.

07:27.758 --> 07:28.892
Unless you guys want
to take turns

07:28.959 --> 07:30.225
scraping him off the trail.

(Chuckles)

07:35.097 --> 07:36.298
Amy: You know, I know that woman
doesn't want

07:36.365 --> 07:37.599
anything to do with us,

07:37.667 --> 07:40.469
but someone needs
to look at her horse.

07:40.537 --> 07:41.537
Ty: Well, maybe we could go
out there

07:41.604 --> 07:43.472
for another ride tomorrow.

07:43.540 --> 07:45.973
Yeah.
That'd be a good idea.

07:46.041 --> 07:47.241
Hey, Avery?

07:47.309 --> 07:50.044
<i>How are ya?</i>
<i>You want a treat?</i>

07:52.414 --> 07:54.315
<i>Good boy, Avery.</i>

07:55.951 --> 07:58.586
Hey. You guys need me
to do anything?

07:58.654 --> 08:01.255
Didn't Mallory just take off
with her friends?

08:01.323 --> 08:02.923
It's too bad you don't know
how to ride.

08:02.990 --> 08:05.759
Badger: Yeah, like I want to go
on some lame trail ride.

08:05.827 --> 08:07.360
I don't play cowboy for anyone.

08:07.428 --> 08:08.394
Right.

08:08.463 --> 08:09.563
I'll go get Harley.

08:10.765 --> 08:11.998
Amy:
Good boy.

08:12.066 --> 08:14.434
So, what's wrong with this guy?

08:15.402 --> 08:17.903
Well, he's pretty picked on
by his old herd,

08:17.971 --> 08:19.905
so now he's afraid of horses.

08:19.973 --> 08:22.942
First step is to get him
to share his feed trough.

08:23.910 --> 08:24.877
<i>Hey, Harley.</i>

08:24.945 --> 08:26.144

08:59.409 --> 09:01.644
Big smiles, united front.

09:01.712 --> 09:02.845
Got it?

09:05.115 --> 09:07.149
Grampa?
Look who's here.

09:07.217 --> 09:09.018
Well I'll be.

09:09.085 --> 09:10.953
The whole family's home now.

09:11.021 --> 09:12.955
Hey, yeah.
Great to be back, Jack.

09:13.023 --> 09:14.323

09:24.166 --> 09:25.233
Great.

09:27.803 --> 09:29.237

09:29.304 --> 09:30.505
Lot of changes around here,
huh?

09:30.572 --> 09:32.339
Lou and Lisa partners now?

09:32.407 --> 09:34.241
That should work out well.

09:34.308 --> 09:36.010
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

Two, uh...

<i>Yeah.</i>

10:01.201 --> 10:03.735
So, I heard about
your screw up with spartan.

10:03.803 --> 10:06.304
How the hell did you hear
about that?

10:06.372 --> 10:07.573
Who the hell are you?

10:07.640 --> 10:10.008
Jamie.
Mallory's friend.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.110
The one she talks
to all the time

10:12.178 --> 10:14.279
about this guy named Badger.

10:14.346 --> 10:16.648
The colic thing,
the running away thing,

10:16.716 --> 10:19.016
the whole
brooding artist thing,

10:19.084 --> 10:21.218
the kiss thing...

10:21.286 --> 10:23.353
Ah...
Okay, I get it.

10:24.322 --> 10:25.890
So you think you know
everything about me.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.491
I know you can't ride.

10:27.559 --> 10:29.961
But if you want to impress
Mallory,

10:30.028 --> 10:31.428
you better learn.

10:31.496 --> 10:33.030
Like... now.

10:38.402 --> 10:40.570
Badger:
Whoa... whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:40.671 --> 10:42.505
Okay...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:42.573 --> 10:43.840
Stop slouching.

10:43.908 --> 10:45.742
This isn't about looking cool.

10:45.810 --> 10:46.977
Clearly.

10:47.044 --> 10:48.912
Just sit up straight.

10:49.814 --> 10:50.946
Can I ask you something?

10:51.014 --> 10:52.214
<i>Mm-hmm?</i>

10:52.281 --> 10:55.350
Why're you doing this?
What's in it for you?

10:55.418 --> 10:57.552
I've got my reasons.

10:57.621 --> 10:59.054
Okay, look.
You seem nice,

10:59.122 --> 11:02.390
but you're Mallory’s
best friend and...

11:02.458 --> 11:04.159
Get over yourself.

11:04.227 --> 11:05.961
I'm not into you.

11:06.029 --> 11:08.295
I want Mallory to be able
to spend more time with you.

11:08.363 --> 11:09.864
Oh. So you're doing this
for her?

11:09.932 --> 11:12.100
Yeah... well, sort of.

11:13.035 --> 11:15.236
I kinda want Jake to myself.

11:17.272 --> 11:19.707
(Scoffs)
Really? Jake?

11:19.775 --> 11:20.808
Mm-hm.

11:21.977 --> 11:23.744
(Wheelbarrow rattles)

11:26.347 --> 11:28.115
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Wow,</i>

11:28.182 --> 11:30.283
Badger on a horse.

11:31.485 --> 11:33.386
Badger:
You, this way.

11:36.290 --> 11:37.991
(Wheelbarrow clunks)

11:41.928 --> 11:45.097
Peter: Well, it sure is nice to have
a family dinner again.

11:45.165 --> 11:46.465
Lou:
I try and cook for him,

11:46.533 --> 11:48.768
but Peter usually ends up
getting stuck eating out

11:48.835 --> 11:51.303
with his business colleagues
in Dubai.

11:51.371 --> 11:52.471
You must get sick of eating

11:52.539 --> 11:53.472
at all those fancy restaurants,

11:53.540 --> 11:56.207
night after night.
Right?

11:57.609 --> 12:00.578
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I do
have to eat out

12:00.646 --> 12:02.681
<i>a little more</i>
<i>than I'd like to.</i>

12:02.748 --> 12:04.582
<i>But you know what I do</i>
<i>do is, ah,</i>

12:04.650 --> 12:07.318
I always make sure I call Lou
if I'm not gonna be home

12:07.386 --> 12:08.787
when I'm supposed to.

12:08.854 --> 12:10.521
A little common courtesy thing.
<i>Right, babe?</i>

12:10.589 --> 12:12.823
(Awkward chuckle)
Right.

12:13.958 --> 12:15.693
Hey, Lou, Ty and I were out
riding today

12:15.760 --> 12:17.761
and we came across
the cutest little donkey.

12:17.829 --> 12:19.863
And turns out that it belongs
to Sarah craven.

12:19.931 --> 12:21.098
Crazy craven?

12:21.166 --> 12:22.633
Mallory, come on.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.235
What? That's what everyone
calls her.

12:24.303 --> 12:26.470
She's gone completely
stark raving mad

12:26.538 --> 12:28.037
being out there all by herself.

12:28.105 --> 12:29.539
Nothin' but gossip.

12:29.607 --> 12:31.408
Don't believe
everything you hear.

12:31.475 --> 12:33.610
Why don't you go get the cake.

12:33.678 --> 12:34.744
Fine.

12:42.853 --> 12:45.987
<i>(Veranda floorboard creaks)</i>

12:46.055 --> 12:47.456
<i>(Shifting sounds)</i>

12:54.497 --> 12:55.564
(Shrieks)

12:59.068 --> 13:00.468
(Exhales heavily)

13:03.806 --> 13:05.605
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>So he's been getting worse then?</i>

13:05.674 --> 13:06.674
Sarah:
I'm here aren't I?

13:06.741 --> 13:08.575
(Falcon nickers)

13:08.643 --> 13:10.377
So he's been laying down a lot?

13:10.444 --> 13:13.446
He gets tired;
He's 22-years-old.

13:14.348 --> 13:15.816
He's gonna have to have
all that dead skin

13:15.884 --> 13:17.685
stripped off his hocks.

13:17.752 --> 13:20.220
Okay.
How long's it gonna take?

13:20.288 --> 13:21.488
It has to be done by our vet,

13:21.556 --> 13:23.490
so, hopefully,
tomorrow morning.

13:23.558 --> 13:25.091
Your horse is gonna have
to stay here over night.

13:25.159 --> 13:26.459
Uh, no.

13:26.527 --> 13:28.728
I've never spent a night
away from falcon.

13:28.796 --> 13:31.298
Well, he's in no shape
to walk home now.

13:31.365 --> 13:33.066
I said I'm not
leaving him here.

13:33.133 --> 13:34.901
That's okay.
We've got an extra room,

13:34.968 --> 13:37.269
and you're welcome to stay.

13:48.281 --> 13:49.448
Hey, falcon.

13:50.350 --> 13:51.917
(Lock clunks, Sarah gasps)

13:51.984 --> 13:53.918
(Gasps) Sarah?

13:55.053 --> 13:56.887
Uh... good morning.

13:57.856 --> 13:59.156
I couldn't sleep in the house.

13:59.225 --> 14:01.058
The damn bed was too soft.

14:01.126 --> 14:04.095
Oh. Uh, would you like
to join us for breakfast?

14:04.162 --> 14:05.830
Uh, no, um...

14:07.533 --> 14:09.033
I have.

14:09.101 --> 14:11.435
Just might be nice
to have some company.

14:11.502 --> 14:14.170
You people talk too much.

14:16.574 --> 14:19.776
You sure do remind me
of Marion.

14:20.845 --> 14:22.779
You knew my mom?

14:22.847 --> 14:25.681
She came out to see falcon
a few times.

14:25.749 --> 14:27.149
When you said your name
was Fleming,

14:27.217 --> 14:28.618
I thought...

14:28.685 --> 14:30.753
Mm, maybe she can help.

14:31.688 --> 14:32.788
She was a real nice lady.

14:32.856 --> 14:35.824
I'm sorry to hear she passed.

14:39.596 --> 14:41.396
(Gate closes)

14:41.464 --> 14:43.298
Lisa: No, I was just thinking
about some minor changes.

14:43.366 --> 14:44.633
You know, like indoor plumbing

14:44.700 --> 14:46.368
and kitchenettes, maybe,
in the cabins,

14:46.435 --> 14:47.802
<i>and, uh...</i>

14:47.870 --> 14:50.104
Maybe a place for a whirlpool.

14:50.172 --> 14:51.406
You mean like a spa?

14:51.474 --> 14:52.974
Yes, exactly!

14:53.041 --> 14:55.677
Like a whole new building
that we would build?

14:55.745 --> 14:59.079
Well, I have an architect
doing up some drawings.

14:59.147 --> 15:02.015
Lisa, these are not
minor changes.

15:02.083 --> 15:03.350
Lou, I know this is your baby,

15:03.418 --> 15:04.717
and I get that.

15:04.786 --> 15:06.586
And I know it's hard
to let go of the reigns...

15:06.654 --> 15:09.289
Let go? I'm not letting go
of anything.

15:09.356 --> 15:11.024
But you're going back to Dubai

15:11.092 --> 15:13.559
and I'm gonna be here
overseeing the day-to-day,

15:13.627 --> 15:17.363
so I think I should be able
to have a part in it's future.

15:17.431 --> 15:20.900
Right? You mean like completely
rethink my entire vision

15:20.967 --> 15:23.135
for the dude ranch?

15:23.203 --> 15:26.505
But see, now,
it's kinda our vision,

15:26.572 --> 15:28.140
isn't it?

15:29.075 --> 15:30.342
Right.

15:33.847 --> 15:36.014
Ty:
He's got zero energy.

15:36.081 --> 15:37.381
He's been lying down so much

15:37.449 --> 15:39.650
he's given himself
these terrible ulcers.

15:39.718 --> 15:40.952
They're pretty bad.

15:41.020 --> 15:42.120
Yeah.

15:42.188 --> 15:43.087
He's been drinking lots
of water

15:43.155 --> 15:45.290
<i>and he's always cold.</i>

15:45.357 --> 15:47.158
He reminds me of that horse
we saw at the Shaley Ranch

15:47.226 --> 15:48.326
a few weeks ago.

15:49.261 --> 15:51.196
Yeah, you're right.

15:51.263 --> 15:52.395
I'll take some blood

15:52.463 --> 15:54.597
and run some tests
at the clinic.

15:54.665 --> 15:55.699
What kind of tests?

15:55.766 --> 15:57.100
And what did that
other horse have?

15:57.168 --> 15:59.269
Cushings disease.
It's pretty serious,

15:59.337 --> 16:01.571
especially at falcon's age.

16:01.639 --> 16:02.840
But let me run the tests

16:02.907 --> 16:04.674
before we jump
to any conclusions.

16:04.742 --> 16:06.043
I'll have results tomorrow.

16:06.110 --> 16:07.344
Tomorrow?!

16:07.411 --> 16:11.113
If I were you,
I'd keep him here over night.

16:11.181 --> 16:13.550
Sarah, the spare room's
all yours...

16:13.617 --> 16:15.051
Or the barn.

16:15.118 --> 16:17.354
Whatever you choose.

16:23.861 --> 16:27.363
(Buzz of chatter,
dishes clank, music plays)

16:27.430 --> 16:28.831
Oh! Hey, Peter,
you're back.

16:28.898 --> 16:30.098
Hey, yeah.

16:30.166 --> 16:31.533
Yeah, just for a short
visit anyway.

16:31.601 --> 16:34.035
Um, Lou told me
you made valedictorian.

16:34.103 --> 16:36.204
Congratulations.
Yeah, thank you. Do you want some coffee?

16:36.272 --> 16:37.740
Yeah, sure.

16:40.776 --> 16:42.410
So, uh...

16:42.478 --> 16:44.579
Got any big plans for the fall?

16:44.646 --> 16:46.080
Uh, business at the u of c.

16:46.147 --> 16:48.383
But I'm hoping to get my MBA
eventually.

16:48.450 --> 16:49.884
Good plan.

16:49.951 --> 16:51.018
You know, I got my start
in that program as well.

16:51.086 --> 16:52.353
Oh, wow.

16:52.421 --> 16:54.455
Um, I'm actually looking
to get some experience

16:54.523 --> 16:56.223
in like a more corporate
environment.

16:56.291 --> 16:58.157
Are you looking
for any summer interns?

16:58.225 --> 16:59.359
You know, there's not a lot
going on

16:59.427 --> 17:00.594
at the Calgary office
right now.

17:00.661 --> 17:02.729
We've kind of moved
everything overseas.

17:02.797 --> 17:04.297
Totally understand.
I just thought, you know,

17:04.365 --> 17:05.298
I'd throw it out there.

17:05.366 --> 17:06.633
Sure.
Well, listen,

17:06.701 --> 17:07.867
let me talk to a few people,
ask around.

17:07.935 --> 17:08.868
If anybody's looking,
I'll let you know.

17:08.935 --> 17:10.804
Oh, that'd be great.
Thanks.

17:10.872 --> 17:11.905
Sure.

17:15.709 --> 17:17.476
Good boy, Avery.

17:17.544 --> 17:19.377
You're all right.

17:19.445 --> 17:21.346
<i>Ty: Think maybe should we try him</i>
<i>with Harley again?</i>

17:21.415 --> 17:22.981
Let's wait.
He needs to trust us

17:23.049 --> 17:25.150
before we can even think about
bringing in another horse.

17:26.619 --> 17:27.685
(Avery nickers)

17:29.288 --> 17:30.388
Good boy.

17:32.090 --> 17:33.157
(Snuffles)

17:37.530 --> 17:38.596
(Whinnies)

17:40.933 --> 17:42.600
Looks like this little guy
wants to visit.

17:42.668 --> 17:44.501
(Avery and lucky nicker
and snuffle)

17:44.569 --> 17:46.269
Come on, lucky, let's go.

17:46.337 --> 17:47.938
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Hey, Sarah?</i>

17:48.005 --> 17:49.440
Do you think maybe you could
give us a hand with something.

17:50.675 --> 17:52.309
What do you need?

17:52.376 --> 17:53.410
Your donkey.

17:57.381 --> 17:58.615
(Gate rattles)

18:01.518 --> 18:02.552
Who's this?

18:02.619 --> 18:04.420
Look at this cute
little guy, huh?

18:04.488 --> 18:06.422
He's skittish, huh?

18:06.490 --> 18:08.624
Yeah, but he's actually
a lot better with lucky

18:08.692 --> 18:10.560
than he is with most horses.

18:10.627 --> 18:12.862
Hm? If I can get him used
to a donkey,

18:12.930 --> 18:16.698
then I can graduate him
to a horse.

18:16.766 --> 18:17.933
(Avery snuffles)

18:18.000 --> 18:19.935
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Hey, what's this, guys?</i>

18:20.002 --> 18:22.203
What's that?
Oh, good boy.

18:23.439 --> 18:26.575
Amy: Look at that!
Ty: Yeah, there we go!

18:26.642 --> 18:27.709
Good boy!

18:28.611 --> 18:32.080
You really have
your mother's ways.

18:32.147 --> 18:33.881
(Laughs)

18:33.949 --> 18:35.148
There you go.

18:38.052 --> 18:40.120
(Phone keys beeping)

18:40.188 --> 18:42.823
So that thing's like
an umbilical cord

18:42.891 --> 18:44.692
to the office.

18:44.759 --> 18:45.993
Hey, I'm not working though,
Jack.

18:46.060 --> 18:47.495
I'm just trying to book
a couple of tickets

18:47.562 --> 18:49.529
for Lou and I to go back
to Dubai next week.

18:49.563 --> 18:51.831
Lou's okay with that?

18:51.899 --> 18:53.399
I don't know.
She's been gone long enough,

18:53.467 --> 18:54.634
so I'm putting my foot down.

18:54.702 --> 18:56.870
(Laughs)
You be careful.

18:56.937 --> 18:58.204
You put your foot down
with Lou,

18:58.271 --> 19:00.807
and she's likely
to stomp on your toes.

19:00.875 --> 19:01.875
Jack and Peter:
(Chuckle)

19:01.942 --> 19:02.876
Right.

19:02.943 --> 19:04.010
(Keys beep)

19:05.211 --> 19:07.345
Level with me here.

19:07.413 --> 19:09.447
What is going on with you two?

19:09.516 --> 19:11.650
I don't know.
I mean...

19:11.718 --> 19:14.219
I get that the dude ranch
is Lou's thing, you know,

19:14.286 --> 19:16.722
but she's been gone
almost a month now.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.356
And Lisa was supposed
to be the answer,

19:18.424 --> 19:20.025
but, you know, apparently
they can't agree on anything,

19:20.092 --> 19:21.559
so...

19:21.593 --> 19:23.060
I've heard that.

19:24.029 --> 19:26.296
So here's an idea.

19:26.364 --> 19:30.100
Why don't you put your fancy
corporate managerial skills

19:30.168 --> 19:31.502
to work at home here,

19:31.570 --> 19:34.705
and come up with some kind
of practical solution.

19:34.773 --> 19:36.640
(Laughs)

19:36.707 --> 19:38.241
Oh, okay, I get it.

19:38.308 --> 19:39.876
So, if I intervene with Lou,

19:39.944 --> 19:40.877
then you won't have to
with Lisa,

19:40.945 --> 19:42.178
is that...?

19:42.246 --> 19:44.380
Well, I'm not the puttin'
my foot down type.

19:44.448 --> 19:46.950
Not with those women anyway.

19:47.018 --> 19:49.218
So I'm counting on you

19:50.154 --> 19:52.155
to make it right.

19:59.763 --> 20:03.532
You're not goin'
and gettin' sick on me, boy.

20:03.600 --> 20:06.334
Don't even think about it.

20:07.503 --> 20:08.870
(Chokes back tears)

20:08.938 --> 20:10.772
Hey, Sarah?

20:10.839 --> 20:12.040
(Falcon nickers)

20:13.008 --> 20:14.842
I'm sorry, are you okay?

20:15.778 --> 20:17.244
Yeah... I'm fine.

20:20.182 --> 20:22.984
He's not even my damn horse,
you know.

20:23.052 --> 20:24.552
He's not?

20:24.619 --> 20:26.086
No.

20:27.088 --> 20:30.991
Belongs to somebody that
I haven't seen in a long time.

20:31.059 --> 20:32.425
(Falcon nickers)

20:33.327 --> 20:35.128
Uh, what do you want?

20:38.432 --> 20:40.567
Amy:
Well, I was thinking,

20:40.634 --> 20:41.801
since it's a nice warm night,

20:41.868 --> 20:44.770
could I leave lucky outside
with Avery.

20:44.838 --> 20:47.807
(Sniffles)
Yeah, you might as well.

20:48.775 --> 20:51.010
We're all stranded here anyway.

20:51.078 --> 20:53.946
I know it's... hard
waiting for results.

20:54.915 --> 20:57.181
I just want to go home.

20:58.117 --> 20:59.818
I have some chickens
that need to be fed

20:59.885 --> 21:01.586
first thing in the morning.

21:01.654 --> 21:03.054
I can look after falcon

21:03.122 --> 21:06.658
if you need to go
and look after your chickens.

21:06.726 --> 21:08.627
I won't leave him.

21:09.862 --> 21:11.129
Okay.

21:11.931 --> 21:14.231
How 'bout I send Mallory
in the morning.

21:14.298 --> 21:15.365
Yeah, fine.

21:22.974 --> 21:24.675
(Barn door shuts)

21:24.743 --> 21:27.177
(Crickets chirp loudly,
owl hoots)

21:30.848 --> 21:31.881
Yeah.

21:34.217 --> 21:35.718
Yeah, okay.

21:36.620 --> 21:38.054
All right.
Thanks, Scott.

21:38.122 --> 21:40.156
(Phone beeps off)

21:41.992 --> 21:44.426
Is it cushings disease?

21:44.494 --> 21:46.128
Yeah.

21:46.196 --> 21:47.596
So what happens now?

21:47.664 --> 21:50.166
Well, there's medication,
but...

21:50.233 --> 21:52.601
It's really expensive
and it might not even work.

21:52.669 --> 21:54.970
Is there anything else
we can do?

21:55.038 --> 21:56.738
Not really,

21:56.806 --> 21:59.107
Scott thinks it's best
if we just put him down.

22:11.922 --> 22:13.255
<i>Morning.</i>

22:13.324 --> 22:14.557
Morning.

22:17.260 --> 22:18.761
I didn't hear you get up.

22:18.779 --> 22:23.516
Yeah, I, uh, wanted to get
a start on these files.

22:24.918 --> 22:26.351
What's going on here, Lou?

22:26.419 --> 22:28.320
Um, I'm trying to come up
with a filing system.

22:28.388 --> 22:30.489
I'm talking about the files.

22:31.391 --> 22:32.824
What's going on with you
and me?

22:32.892 --> 22:34.059
Okay...

22:34.126 --> 22:36.195
I don't know
what you want me to say.

22:36.262 --> 22:37.462
I'm trying here, okay, Peter?

22:37.530 --> 22:39.665
I really am,
but I have a business to run.

22:39.732 --> 22:41.700
And I can't just drop
everything

22:41.767 --> 22:43.434
and move back to Dubai.

22:43.502 --> 22:45.936
Okay.
So, just so I'm clear

22:46.004 --> 22:49.073
on what it is exactly
that you're saying is,

22:49.140 --> 22:51.475
what's keeping you here
is the dude ranch, right?

22:51.543 --> 22:53.077
Yes.

22:53.144 --> 22:54.778
Okay, well, I think I may have
a solution for you then.

22:54.846 --> 22:55.946
You do?

22:56.014 --> 22:57.348
Maybe.

22:57.416 --> 22:58.848
Lo, I have a business
manager here

22:58.916 --> 23:01.218
to care of my interests
when I'm away.

23:01.285 --> 23:03.786
Right? I mean we could do
the same for you.

23:03.854 --> 23:07.190
Okay, but I can't afford
to pay a business manager.

23:07.258 --> 23:09.058
That's why you hire
someone who's young

23:09.126 --> 23:11.228
and eager for the experience.

23:11.295 --> 23:12.762
Someone like Soraya.

23:12.830 --> 23:14.396
Soraya?

23:14.464 --> 23:15.664
(Scoffs) Wow.

23:17.400 --> 23:18.567
What?

23:18.635 --> 23:20.436
Apparently my dude ranch
is so small time

23:20.503 --> 23:22.971
and insignificant that, heck,

23:23.039 --> 23:25.006
even a teenager can run it.

23:25.074 --> 23:26.709
You're impossible,
you know that?

23:26.776 --> 23:28.777
Honestly. I'm not gonna leave
my business

23:28.845 --> 23:31.679
in the hands of one
of my sister's friends, Peter.

23:31.747 --> 23:34.315
The dude ranch
is important to me.

23:34.383 --> 23:36.217
More important
than your marriage?

23:36.285 --> 23:38.353
That is so unfair.

23:40.522 --> 23:41.856
Okay, I've got a meeting
in Calgary.

23:41.923 --> 23:43.458
We'll talk later, all right?

23:46.461 --> 23:49.229
(Sarah clears her throat)

23:50.798 --> 23:53.166
What're you doing here?

23:53.234 --> 23:54.901
I sleep here.

23:56.571 --> 23:57.604
Hey.
Hey.

24:00.408 --> 24:03.409
Sarah, um, we have some news.

24:06.012 --> 24:08.147
Ty: It's a pretty severe
glandular condition,

24:08.214 --> 24:11.250
so that's why your horse
is lying down all the time.

24:11.318 --> 24:13.319
Sarah:
So what do we do?

24:13.387 --> 24:16.455
There are treatments,
but only for the symptoms

24:16.523 --> 24:18.423
<i>and not for the disease.</i>

24:18.491 --> 24:21.092
And at falcon's age, um...

24:21.994 --> 24:23.227
Well, it's...

24:23.296 --> 24:24.562
I think what Ty's trying to say

24:24.630 --> 24:27.265
is that falcon may not
get any better.

24:27.333 --> 24:28.366
You're wrong.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.936
You're not even a real vet.

24:32.004 --> 24:33.738
He's just trying to help.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.472
It's okay.

24:36.441 --> 24:37.775
Maybe it's better
if you hear this from Scott.

24:37.842 --> 24:39.343
No.

24:39.411 --> 24:40.977
I've heard enough.

24:45.717 --> 24:47.217
What are these treatments?

24:47.285 --> 24:48.752
It's medication.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.986
It doesn't always work,
and it's very expensive.

24:51.054 --> 24:53.155
Well, I don't have any money.

24:53.223 --> 24:56.359
So there has to be another way.

24:57.894 --> 24:59.395
Your mother would've known
what to do.

25:03.434 --> 25:04.500
(Water sprays)

25:06.336 --> 25:07.936
(Handles clatter)

25:08.705 --> 25:11.873
I can't believe I have to go
to crazy craven's creepy cabin

25:11.941 --> 25:14.343
to feed her stupid chickens.

25:15.411 --> 25:17.679
Want some company?

25:17.747 --> 25:19.047
No, you've only had one lesson,

25:19.114 --> 25:21.983
so I doubt you'll be able
to keep up.

25:22.051 --> 25:23.517
I'm a quick study.

25:23.585 --> 25:27.120
Plus, Jamie's a real good
teacher.

25:27.188 --> 25:28.622
I bet she is.

25:29.558 --> 25:33.694
(Door clunks open,
broom swishes, chimes jingle)

25:35.630 --> 25:37.231
(Clears throat)
Sarah?

25:37.298 --> 25:40.199
Oh yeah, um, your porch
just need sweeping.

25:40.267 --> 25:42.469
Oh, great.
Um...

25:43.437 --> 25:46.473
Hey, listen,
about the barn earlier...

25:48.542 --> 25:51.077
No one's supposed to know
about me and Peter;

25:51.144 --> 25:54.247
that we're... fighting.

25:54.314 --> 25:56.448
Hey, I'm no gossip.

25:56.549 --> 25:57.683
Thanks.

25:58.852 --> 25:59.951
You know, it's not like
we fight like that

26:00.019 --> 26:01.620
all the time.

26:01.688 --> 26:05.090
It's just been...
Complicated.

26:05.157 --> 26:06.392
You got it right.

26:06.459 --> 26:08.527
Being out there on your own,

26:08.595 --> 26:10.795
doing whatever you want,
no interruptions.

26:10.863 --> 26:11.962
Just...

26:12.865 --> 26:14.465
Totally on your own.

26:14.533 --> 26:17.034
(Scoffs)
Like a hermit, right?

26:17.102 --> 26:19.370
No, that's not what I meant.
I...

26:19.438 --> 26:21.338
"Crazy craven" -
that's what you meant.

26:21.407 --> 26:22.373
That's what they call me
in town.

26:22.441 --> 26:24.208
No, I...

26:24.276 --> 26:26.110
I didn't mean that.

26:26.177 --> 26:29.312
Believe it or not, I know...

26:29.380 --> 26:33.283
What it's like to be lonely
in a marriage.

26:35.453 --> 26:36.453
You're married?

26:36.521 --> 26:38.321
Was.

26:38.389 --> 26:41.525
Do you mind if I ask
what happened?

26:42.459 --> 26:44.259
Oh, Ethan and me, we, uh...

26:44.327 --> 26:47.863
We didn't have any family -
it was just the two of us...

26:47.931 --> 26:50.065
and we wanted to live off
the grid,

26:50.133 --> 26:52.735
you know, get back to the land.

26:52.803 --> 26:54.403
Six months in, Ethan decided

26:54.471 --> 26:55.971
he couldn't stand
the isolation.

26:56.039 --> 26:57.172
So the fool decided

26:57.240 --> 27:01.342
he wanted to travel
the world instead.

27:01.410 --> 27:03.511
You guys wanted
different things.

27:03.579 --> 27:04.679
Yeah.

27:06.214 --> 27:08.750
And we started to fight.

27:10.018 --> 27:11.419
But I wanted to make it work.

27:11.487 --> 27:12.787
I just thought, you know,

27:12.855 --> 27:15.789
if we could just give it
one more month...

27:15.857 --> 27:18.992
Eventually,
he threatened to leave.

27:19.928 --> 27:22.930
I thought it was a bunch
of hot... hot air,

27:22.997 --> 27:24.364
'til he walked out the door
one night

27:24.432 --> 27:26.132
and he didn't come back.

27:26.200 --> 27:29.536
Not even for that damn horse,
falcon.

27:29.604 --> 27:31.904
Sarah. I'm...
I'm so sorry.

27:32.840 --> 27:34.907
Oh hey... I'm not.

27:37.410 --> 27:39.679
It made me stronger.

27:41.815 --> 27:43.115
I mean, 20 years later,

27:43.183 --> 27:46.651
I'm... living the life
I always imagined:

27:47.620 --> 27:49.087
Just me,

27:49.154 --> 27:51.055
the land, the animals...

27:53.659 --> 27:55.727
That's all I need.

28:02.734 --> 28:04.802
(Birds chirp, chickens cluck)

28:05.737 --> 28:07.070
Badger:
Pretty good, huh?

28:07.138 --> 28:09.773
Not bad for a beginner.

28:09.841 --> 28:12.442
Badger: Yeah, I got some
pretty mad skills.

28:12.511 --> 28:14.745
In a few more lessons,
I'll be galloping.

28:14.813 --> 28:17.615
You're gonna be taking
more lessons?

28:17.682 --> 28:19.348
<i>Badger:</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

28:20.718 --> 28:22.118
(Chickens cluck)

28:26.423 --> 28:28.024
(Clucking)

28:30.394 --> 28:31.995
I hate chickens.

28:32.062 --> 28:34.096
Stop being such a city boy.

28:34.164 --> 28:35.831
Get in here.

28:35.899 --> 28:38.333
You sure none of these guys
have, ah...

28:38.401 --> 28:40.268
<i>Salmonella or...</i>

28:40.336 --> 28:42.971
<i>Avian swine flu,</i>
<i>or...</i>

28:43.873 --> 28:44.940
<i>Ugh.</i>

28:45.274 --> 28:47.075
Eh...

28:47.143 --> 28:49.678
Face your fear!

28:49.746 --> 28:51.946
<i>Oh, get up,</i>
<i>you big baby.</i>

28:52.014 --> 28:54.849
You're the biggest chicken
in the coop.

28:55.817 --> 28:57.317
<i>Mallory:</i>
<i>Don't you dare!</i>

28:57.385 --> 28:58.953
(Chickens cluck)

28:59.021 --> 29:00.721
<i>Badger:</i>
<i>I... I can't believe you did that!</i>

29:00.789 --> 29:01.956
(Clucking)

29:02.024 --> 29:04.559
Mallory:
Come on, let's go.

29:06.061 --> 29:07.861
Badger! Look!

29:07.929 --> 29:09.095
(Gasps)

29:09.163 --> 29:11.297
You didn't tie off your horse!

29:12.199 --> 29:13.466
(Sighs)
Come on.

29:14.468 --> 29:15.902
<i>Badger:</i>
<i>He couldn't have gotten far.</i>

29:15.970 --> 29:17.270
Memphis!

29:17.337 --> 29:19.238
<i>Badger:</i>
<i>Memphis!</i>

29:19.306 --> 29:20.540
Memphis!

29:23.443 --> 29:24.509
(Phone rings)

29:30.083 --> 29:32.051
(Exhales, phone beeps on)

29:33.019 --> 29:33.953
Hey.

29:34.020 --> 29:35.487
Hey, Lou, listen...

29:36.456 --> 29:37.522
I didn't come all the way
from Dubai

29:37.591 --> 29:39.123
just to fight with you, okay?

29:39.191 --> 29:41.525
I'm not enjoying this
any more than you are.

29:41.594 --> 29:43.427
It's just...

29:43.495 --> 29:44.796
Look, you knew that
when we got married,

29:44.863 --> 29:46.631
we were gonna move away, right?

29:46.699 --> 29:47.765
I know, I...

29:49.668 --> 29:52.536
I thought it was going
to be easier,

29:52.605 --> 29:53.638
but it's not.

29:53.706 --> 29:55.371
So, what're you saying?

29:55.439 --> 29:57.874
You think you made a mistake?

30:00.645 --> 30:01.712
(Sighs)

30:03.581 --> 30:04.881
Okay.

30:04.949 --> 30:06.483
Uh, look, I gotta work late
at the office,

30:06.550 --> 30:08.752
so I'm just gonna stay
in the city tonight, all right?

30:08.820 --> 30:10.420
(Phone beeps off)

30:10.488 --> 30:12.021
Come on, Peter...

30:12.956 --> 30:14.890
P-Peter?

30:17.594 --> 30:19.495
(Phone beeps off)

30:19.562 --> 30:20.763
(Sighs deeply)

Ah, there he is.

30:28.570 --> 30:29.971
Mallory:
(Sighs)

30:33.475 --> 30:34.776
(Memphis nickers)

30:35.678 --> 30:37.512
Mallory:
Come here, boy.

30:38.413 --> 30:39.080
Okay...

30:41.884 --> 30:43.450
(Memphis nickers)

30:43.518 --> 30:46.419
Mallory: You still have a lot
to learn about horses.

30:46.487 --> 30:47.855
Why is this my fault?

30:47.922 --> 30:49.589
You're the one who attacked me
with a chicken.

30:49.658 --> 30:50.858
(Wood creak and snaps)

30:50.925 --> 30:53.193
Badger and Mallory:
(Scream)

31:09.142 --> 31:10.276
Yeah...

31:14.581 --> 31:15.681
(Winces)

31:15.748 --> 31:16.948
Your arm.

31:17.016 --> 31:18.317
I'm fine.

31:21.221 --> 31:24.189
Oh my God,
we have to get out of here.

(Wooden slats snap,
Mallory shrieks)

31:32.064 --> 31:33.331
(Coughing)

31:33.399 --> 31:35.667
I don't think
we're climbing out.

31:35.734 --> 31:37.235
(Coughs)

31:37.303 --> 31:39.069
What do we do?

31:40.171 --> 31:41.638
Help! Anyone!

31:42.607 --> 31:44.741
Help! Somebody!
Help!

31:44.809 --> 31:47.477

Come here, Avery.

31:59.296 --> 32:01.097
See? Who's this?

32:01.164 --> 32:02.765
Who's that?

32:02.833 --> 32:05.134
Hey, you're not scared of him.

32:05.202 --> 32:07.103
Hmm.

32:07.170 --> 32:08.471
Who's that, huh?

32:08.539 --> 32:11.039
(Chuckles)
Good boy.

32:12.642 --> 32:14.809
Jake:
Hey, Amy. Mallory around?

32:14.877 --> 32:16.678
Uh, no, she just rode up
to Sarah craven's place

32:16.746 --> 32:17.679
with Badger.

32:17.747 --> 32:19.047
Okay, thanks.

32:19.115 --> 32:21.450
That's weird.
Since when does Badger ride?

32:21.517 --> 32:22.851
Looks like it's going to be
just the two of us

32:22.918 --> 32:24.185
this afternoon.

32:24.254 --> 32:25.819
Uh, craven's place
isn't far from here.

32:25.887 --> 32:27.521
Maybe we can catch up.

32:27.589 --> 32:28.922
(Clicks tongue)

32:29.858 --> 32:31.125
There you go, Avery.

32:31.192 --> 32:32.760
You're a good boy.

32:33.862 --> 32:35.896
It's not so scary, huh?

32:45.239 --> 32:47.006
Your arm -
is it okay?

32:47.074 --> 32:48.508
Yeah, I'm fine.

32:48.576 --> 32:50.543
Okay, stop saying you're fine,
I know you're not.

32:50.611 --> 32:53.112
Just let me look at it.

32:55.583 --> 32:57.216
Does this hurt?

32:57.284 --> 32:58.584
No.

32:58.652 --> 33:00.786
'Kay, does-
Ahhh! Yes!

33:00.853 --> 33:02.488
Okay...

33:02.555 --> 33:03.989
(Exhales shakily)

33:04.056 --> 33:07.025
We need to immobilize your arm.

33:07.994 --> 33:09.861
You sound like you know
what you're doing.

33:09.929 --> 33:12.364
Lou made me take
a first aid course

33:12.432 --> 33:14.599
when I first started working
at heartland.

33:14.667 --> 33:17.669
This might throw a wrench
in your riding lessons

33:17.736 --> 33:19.236
with Jamie.

33:25.243 --> 33:26.377
What?

33:26.445 --> 33:27.478
You know...

33:28.347 --> 33:30.347
You and her...

33:31.282 --> 33:32.949
Are you kidding?

33:33.017 --> 33:34.017
The only reason
I'm taking lessons

33:34.084 --> 33:36.753
is so I can go riding with you.

33:36.821 --> 33:37.887
Oh...

33:45.262 --> 33:46.862
(Exhales heavily)

33:47.798 --> 33:48.964
What is that?

33:49.032 --> 33:50.199
What?

33:50.266 --> 33:51.334
That.

34:03.278 --> 34:05.347
Mallory and Badger:
(Frightened gasps and shrieks)

34:05.414 --> 34:07.014
Oh my God...

34:07.850 --> 34:09.250
<i>Oh my God!</i>

34:10.185 --> 34:11.118
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Oh, and, uh, one of these.</i>

34:11.186 --> 34:12.454
Okay, five dollars.

34:12.521 --> 34:14.088
All right.
See ya.

34:14.156 --> 34:15.223
Thanks.

34:17.125 --> 34:18.525
Lou.
Hey.

34:18.592 --> 34:19.860
I'm glad I ran into you.

34:19.927 --> 34:21.328
Me too.

34:21.396 --> 34:23.697
Um, I think we got off on
the wrong foot the other day.

34:23.764 --> 34:25.165
Yeah, you know what?
What don't...

34:25.233 --> 34:27.368
Why don't we just put that
behind us and move forward?

34:27.435 --> 34:28.435
Perfect.

34:28.503 --> 34:29.603
'Cause want the same thing
here.

34:29.670 --> 34:31.938
We want the dude ranch
to succeed, right?

34:32.005 --> 34:33.206
At least that we can agree on.

34:33.274 --> 34:34.373
Okay, good.

34:35.509 --> 34:37.076
I want to show you these plans,

34:37.143 --> 34:38.978
so that you know
where I'm coming from.

34:39.045 --> 34:41.781
Lisa, I need you to understand
that these plans

34:41.849 --> 34:43.750
run counter to everything
I have learned

34:43.817 --> 34:45.083
in the past two years.

34:45.150 --> 34:48.152
Okay, but just look them
before you reject them.

34:48.221 --> 34:49.221
Okay?

34:49.289 --> 34:50.389
Okay.

34:51.456 --> 34:53.190
Okay?

34:53.259 --> 34:55.293
Okay.
Wow. Don't panic.

34:56.262 --> 34:57.462
You guys want some coffee?

34:57.530 --> 34:58.930
Yes, I would love some.
Thank you.

34:58.998 --> 35:00.131
I'm good.

35:00.199 --> 35:01.966
Ooh, are you guys renovating?

35:02.034 --> 35:03.535
Uh, no, we're...

35:03.603 --> 35:07.671
Well, hopefully updating
the dude ranch a little bit.

35:07.739 --> 35:10.140
<i>Sauna, whirlpool,</i>
<i>little spa...</i>

35:10.208 --> 35:11.642
Okay, um... well...

35:12.611 --> 35:14.044
I mean, I know
it's none of my business,

35:14.112 --> 35:16.280
but tons of German tourists

35:16.347 --> 35:17.548
come through the diner
every summer

35:17.616 --> 35:19.249
<i>and they all want</i>
<i>the same thing:</i>

35:19.317 --> 35:20.984
Um, rustic, western...

35:21.052 --> 35:25.121
I mean, a totally authentic
cowboy experience.

35:25.188 --> 35:26.322
If I were you,

35:26.390 --> 35:28.625
I'd leave the dude ranch
just as it is.

35:28.692 --> 35:31.360
Let me get you some more sugar.

35:32.329 --> 35:34.297
Well, I'm sure you're loving
hearing that.

35:34.364 --> 35:38.033
I couldn't have said it
better myself.

35:39.001 --> 35:40.268
(Exhales)

35:41.203 --> 35:44.606
<i>Badger:</i>
<i>This is seriously messed up.</i>

35:44.674 --> 35:47.576
We are gonna die down here,
just like he did.

35:47.644 --> 35:49.044
We're not gonna die.

35:49.111 --> 35:52.013
Nobody knows we're here.
They think we're at Sarah's.

35:52.081 --> 35:53.281
(Stammering,
searching for words)

35:53.349 --> 35:54.549
Look, somebody will find us.

35:54.616 --> 35:55.616
No, they won't1

35:55.684 --> 35:57.685
we are in the middle
of nowhere.

35:57.753 --> 36:01.088
This is the last place they'll look.
Mallory! Mallory.

36:01.156 --> 36:03.624
They'll send a search party,
okay?

36:04.593 --> 36:05.927
They'll send someone.

36:05.994 --> 36:07.061
Who?

36:09.297 --> 36:10.363
Lassie?

36:11.265 --> 36:12.632
(Exhales)

36:15.069 --> 36:17.971
I don't wanna die down here.

36:19.907 --> 36:22.876
I'm not gonna
let that happen, okay?

36:22.944 --> 36:24.711
We'll be okay.

36:28.715 --> 36:30.315
There's got to be something
in my mom's journals

36:30.383 --> 36:32.618
about cushings disease.

36:32.686 --> 36:34.487
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>You guys know where Badger is?</i>

36:34.554 --> 36:35.988
I can never seem to find him.

36:36.055 --> 36:37.322
Uh, yeah, I think he went
with Mallory

36:37.390 --> 36:38.290
up to Sarah craven's,

36:38.358 --> 36:39.592
but that was hours ago.

36:39.659 --> 36:41.126
Well, he better get back soon.

36:41.194 --> 36:42.393
That kid's gotta learn

36:42.461 --> 36:43.728
how to pull his weight
around here.

36:47.332 --> 36:49.834
How's it going
with that falcon horse?

36:49.902 --> 36:51.603
(Sighs)
Not so good.

36:53.238 --> 36:54.572
Scott says
the most humane thing to do

36:54.640 --> 36:56.040
is put him down.

36:58.342 --> 36:59.442
Oh?

37:00.512 --> 37:02.679
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

37:02.747 --> 37:03.914
It's just at falcon's age,

37:03.982 --> 37:05.916
Scott thinks that
he won't get much better.

37:05.984 --> 37:08.151
Well, what do you think?

37:08.219 --> 37:09.987
I think there's still hope.

37:10.054 --> 37:11.287
I want to try and help falcon,

37:11.355 --> 37:14.557
but not if it means
he's gonna suffer.

37:14.625 --> 37:16.926
Well, your mom always knew
when a horse's time had come,

37:16.994 --> 37:19.929
but until that moment
she never gave up.

37:19.997 --> 37:21.397
I know Scott's
a pretty good vet,

37:21.464 --> 37:23.465
but sometimes you gotta go
with your instincts.

37:23.533 --> 37:26.435
So what's your gut tell you?

37:30.306 --> 37:31.340
(Hooves thunder)

37:32.909 --> 37:36.412
<i>Jamie:</i>
<i>There's the other horse.</i>

37:36.479 --> 37:37.678
Jake:
That's weird.

37:37.746 --> 37:39.947
Jamie:
I wonder where they are?

37:40.015 --> 37:42.583
Jake: Come on.
(Clicks tongue)

37:49.158 --> 37:50.224
Badger...

37:51.760 --> 37:52.826
Yeah.

37:56.364 --> 37:57.597
If we don't get out of here...

My mom wrote in her journal
about this herb chasteberry.

you could do.

38:49.780 --> 38:52.048

38:59.123 --> 39:00.656
I know you don't
wanna hear this, but...

39:00.724 --> 39:03.025
Yeah, I understand.

39:03.093 --> 39:05.027
Sarah, we're gonna have
to keep falcon here,

39:05.095 --> 39:08.531
so we can keep a close eye
on him.

39:09.433 --> 39:10.933
We'll take really good care
of him.

39:11.001 --> 39:12.067
I promise, okay?

39:12.136 --> 39:13.368
You're just gonna
have to trust us.

41:37.899 --> 41:38.899
Oh yeah?

41:38.967 --> 41:40.368
Sure.

41:40.435 --> 41:42.736
I can even show you how to ride
a horse with one arm.

41:42.804 --> 41:43.837
(Laughs)

41:47.542 --> 41:49.543
Got your message.

41:51.212 --> 41:53.813
You know, I was thinking
it wasn't that long ago

41:53.881 --> 41:56.115
you asked me to marry you,
right here.

41:59.220 --> 42:01.020
I hired Soraya.

42:02.289 --> 42:03.556
<i>Peter:</i>
<i>Good.</i>

42:04.491 --> 42:07.125
I want to make this work,
Peter.

42:07.194 --> 42:10.496
I don't wanna be away
from you anymore.

42:11.698 --> 42:13.532
Neither do I.

42:14.434 --> 42:15.767
I, um...

42:15.835 --> 42:18.969
I'm gonna need a few days
to train Soraya.

42:19.037 --> 42:20.071
Okay.

42:21.073 --> 42:22.940
Will you stay with me?

42:23.008 --> 42:24.875
Ah.

42:24.943 --> 42:26.944
Of course I will.

42:29.215 --> 42:31.249
You know, I...

42:31.317 --> 42:33.983
I just missed you so much.

42:34.885 --> 42:36.119
Honestly, I didn't know
it was possible

42:36.187 --> 42:37.921
to miss a person that much.

42:39.857 --> 42:42.125
And I was scared.

42:42.193 --> 42:44.361
I thought I might be
losing you.

42:44.429 --> 42:45.529
No.

42:46.631 --> 42:48.765
No, I'm right here.

42:49.733 --> 42:51.534
I'm right here.

42:54.003 --> 42:56.038
♪ Oh, when the tide pulls
the sand awry ♪

42:58.975 --> 43:03.713
♪ oh, when the tide pulls
the sand awry ♪

43:06.215 --> 43:07.582
Sarah: Hey.
Ty: Hey there.

43:07.650 --> 43:08.717
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Hey.</i>

43:11.987 --> 43:13.455
Sarah:
Oh yeah...

43:16.892 --> 43:19.227
Falcon's looking better
every day.

43:19.295 --> 43:20.762
He's got more energy.

43:20.829 --> 43:22.529
And it might be
too early to tell,

43:22.597 --> 43:26.199
but I think those herbs
are working.

43:29.937 --> 43:31.138
How's lucky doing?

43:31.205 --> 43:33.274
(Nickering and snuffling)

43:33.341 --> 43:34.775
Amy:
Really good.

43:34.842 --> 43:36.543
<i>Thanks so much</i>
<i>for letting her stay here.</i>

43:36.611 --> 43:39.044
Her and Avery
have really bonded.

43:39.980 --> 43:41.180
You know, Sarah,

43:41.248 --> 43:43.048
it would be a shame
to separate them.

43:45.985 --> 43:49.655
Are you suggesting that
I take this damn horse home?

43:49.722 --> 43:50.656
Maybe.

43:50.723 --> 43:52.457
Ah, no way.

43:53.393 --> 43:55.327
No, it's too much trouble.

43:55.395 --> 43:57.061
Yeah, but look at them.

43:57.129 --> 43:59.798
He's not even afraid of falcon.

44:00.866 --> 44:03.768
(Luck and Avery nicker
and whinny)

44:08.607 --> 44:09.640
What do you say, lucky?

44:11.476 --> 44:13.277
(Whinnying and braying)

44:16.147 --> 44:18.415
I think he says yes.

44:20.250 --> 44:22.185
Sarah and Amy:
