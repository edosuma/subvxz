01:39.792 --> 01:42.344
-Here you go, miss.
-Thank you.

01:44.014 --> 01:45.956
Step through, please.

01:48.109 --> 01:50.213
Open your laptop, please.

01:55.211 --> 01:57.992
I guess people take their computers
with them everywhere nowadays.

01:58.186 --> 01:59.495
Security blanket.

01:59.689 --> 02:01.096
Lucky blanket.

02:02.633 --> 02:04.006
Next.

02:18.148 --> 02:20.732
Wow, even answer your own door,
senator.

02:20.930 --> 02:22.839
-I'm impressed.
-Front-porch mentality.

02:23.042 --> 02:24.602
I like to know who's visiting.

02:24.801 --> 02:28.029
Plus, my secretary, Laura,
just stepped out for an early lunch.

02:28.511 --> 02:30.649
Caroline Eldridge from
Family First is visiting.

02:30.847 --> 02:33.529
You're early. I like that. Come in.

02:37.373 --> 02:39.925
-Let's take the sofa.
-Okay.

02:42.075 --> 02:44.824
Hope you don't mind if I take
this out.

02:45.019 --> 02:48.149
My hard drive is now officially
my only source of memory...

02:48.345 --> 02:51.956
...and I wanna get all those
old-fashioned values down accurately.

02:52.151 --> 02:55.184
Now, as you know, we're putting
together our Family First brochure...

02:55.382 --> 02:58.032
...and we've got pictures
that we could use captions for.

02:58.677 --> 03:00.586
-Fire away.
-Okay.

03:00.789 --> 03:03.537
Let's start with this one.

03:03.732 --> 03:07.473
That's me and some of the staff
in the Gulf of Mexico after Katrina.

03:08.051 --> 03:09.960
Heartbreaking stuff.

03:10.481 --> 03:11.790
Okay.

03:11.985 --> 03:13.447
Let's call this:

03:13.649 --> 03:16.070
"Senator Sachs and staff
lend a hand in hurricane relief.

03:19.343 --> 03:21.065
-Good.
-How about that?

03:21.262 --> 03:22.756
That's one of my former interns...

03:22.957 --> 03:24.582
...Josh.

03:24.781 --> 03:26.722
Must have been taken his last day
of work.

03:26.924 --> 03:28.811
Let's call it:

03:29.227 --> 03:33.187
-"lntern program a success."
-Okay.

03:34.058 --> 03:35.399
Met a lot of good kids that way.

03:36.169 --> 03:37.695
I'll bet.

03:39.752 --> 03:41.344
How about that one?

03:41.543 --> 03:43.103
Wait, let me try.

03:43.303 --> 03:47.196
"lntern program has fringe benefits"?

03:48.037 --> 03:49.466
Let's see.

03:50.692 --> 03:53.658
-Let's call it "extramarital Sachs."
-Who are you?

03:53.859 --> 03:56.892
Someone who thinks it's a bit
hypocritical for the past two years...

03:57.090 --> 03:59.740
...you've tried to limit the civil rights
of gay individuals...

03:59.937 --> 04:01.943
-...while being gay yourself.
-Lady--

04:02.145 --> 04:04.413
Preach family first
as if there's one kind of family.

04:04.608 --> 04:08.251
I don't know what you think you got
but let me explain something to you.

04:08.446 --> 04:11.707
What I've got is a signed statement
by Josh.

04:11.901 --> 04:15.576
We've got canceled checks and
he's ready to turn over the love notes.

04:15.772 --> 04:18.870
-Laura.
-Out to lunch, remember?

04:19.067 --> 04:20.757
It's gonna be your word against his.

04:20.954 --> 04:23.287
We're running his tomorrow.

04:23.481 --> 04:25.749
I work for David Shane
at the New york Courier.

04:25.944 --> 04:26.958
Jesus Christ.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.850
Josh came to us seven
months ago...

04:29.047 --> 04:31.021
...and thought we'd be interested
in knowing...

04:31.223 --> 04:34.156
...that he's not the only handsome
skeleton in your closet.

04:34.358 --> 04:36.812
So we thought we'd give you
an opportunity to respond.

04:38.484 --> 04:40.425
Anything you want.

04:41.651 --> 04:45.261
I will give you anything
that you want.

04:45.458 --> 04:46.886
Anything.

04:49.232 --> 04:52.046
I will give-- I will give you anything
that you want.

04:52.240 --> 04:53.319
Anything.

04:53.519 --> 04:55.111
You just did, senator.

04:55.694 --> 04:57.798
You just did.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.009
Tell me you got that, Miles.

05:00.205 --> 05:01.830
Please tell me you got that.

05:02.028 --> 05:03.238
I got it, you psychopath.

05:03.436 --> 05:05.290
Jump on the shuttle,
get down to the paper.

05:05.484 --> 05:07.872
And we'll get fantastically,
exceedingly drunk.

05:10.665 --> 05:13.414
I will give you anything that you want,
anything.

05:13.609 --> 05:15.102
One more time.

05:15.304 --> 05:16.710
You transmitted from D.C.

05:16.903 --> 05:18.080
And recorded in New York.

05:18.279 --> 05:20.001
-Go to Legal. It'll check.
-I intend to.

05:20.198 --> 05:22.205
Also we need to clear
the quote from the intern.

05:22.406 --> 05:24.609
He's at home waiting for the call.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.293
This your headline, David Shane?

05:28.995 --> 05:30.304
Yep.

05:30.498 --> 05:31.480
We'll be at Chumley's...

05:31.683 --> 05:35.326
...ordering copious amounts of drinks
on this paper.

05:36.033 --> 05:37.440
God, I love this job.

05:37.632 --> 05:39.541
Hey, hey. To David Shane.

05:39.743 --> 05:42.198
May this article bring you
all the prizes you deserve.

05:42.399 --> 05:46.708
Fame, alcoholism,
rehab, relapse, rehab.

05:46.909 --> 05:49.461
When you win the Pulitzer,
don't forget the little people.

05:49.660 --> 05:52.278
Oh, fuck the little people.

05:52.475 --> 05:55.125
Hey, you're empty. You buy, I fly.

05:56.538 --> 05:58.392
Excuse me, sweetheart.

06:03.128 --> 06:05.876
Careful, Ro. Next round he might aim
for your lips.

06:06.071 --> 06:08.972
Mr. Arvis Narron.

06:09.430 --> 06:14.000
What kind of name is Arvis?

06:14.868 --> 06:15.816
Family name.

06:18.226 --> 06:19.470
Story's been pulled, Ro.

06:19.666 --> 06:22.121
Somebody got to your intern.
Made him clam up.

06:22.321 --> 06:25.168
My guess is somebody with lots
of zeroes.

06:25.489 --> 06:27.081
What?

06:27.471 --> 06:28.681
Well...

06:29.039 --> 06:30.533
...I'm just gonna go call him.

06:31.343 --> 06:33.098
You'll get his lawyer,
just like we did.

06:33.294 --> 06:35.878
Do you know I've been working
on this story for six months?

06:36.077 --> 06:37.004
Six.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.301
Take a couple weeks off.
You've earned the break.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.222
I'm gonna go back to the office
right now.

06:41.419 --> 06:43.240
This guy's got a stack
of interns, trust me.

06:43.434 --> 06:46.695
Kolski wants you to take
a couple of weeks off.

06:46.889 --> 06:47.871
That's not a request.

06:48.072 --> 06:49.795
Okay, wait, hold up.

06:50.344 --> 06:51.488
Please tell me...

06:51.688 --> 06:54.720
...you're not saying because the paper
endorsed Sachs' last campaign...

06:54.919 --> 06:56.063
...that he's off-limits now.

06:56.262 --> 06:58.530
Please tell me that is not
what you're saying.

06:58.726 --> 07:00.481
-What's up, Narron?
-Get this, Miles.

07:00.677 --> 07:03.359
Tomorrow's headline:
"Free Press Dead."

07:03.556 --> 07:06.173
Kolski wants to shut me down
because I went after the senator.

07:06.371 --> 07:07.777
Does it ever get to you, Narron?

07:07.971 --> 07:11.744
The idea that we're supposed to be
reporting the news not covering it up?

07:11.937 --> 07:14.456
Like we couldn't show the dead
bodies coming back from lraq.

07:14.656 --> 07:16.597
If you don't see it,
means it never happened.

07:16.799 --> 07:17.748
Your source ran dry.

07:17.951 --> 07:20.284
-My source didn't run dry.
-You can't try to cover up--

07:20.478 --> 07:23.292
My source was paid off.

07:23.485 --> 07:25.371
This is a good story, Narron.

07:26.205 --> 07:27.317
The story's dead.

07:29.307 --> 07:30.681
Classic.

07:30.874 --> 07:34.419
Powerful men
protecting powerful men.

07:34.617 --> 07:36.308
I backed you when you wanted
anonymity...

07:36.505 --> 07:38.871
...when you wanted to write under
an old boy's name.

07:39.064 --> 07:42.543
This is not the first time you shut me
down but this is definitely the last.

07:42.742 --> 07:48.108
So you tell Kolski keep his paid
vacation because I fucking quit.

07:49.429 --> 07:51.664
Taxi. Hey.

08:07.726 --> 08:08.969
Rowena?

08:10.765 --> 08:13.350
Rowena. Wait up.

08:17.707 --> 08:20.456
Wait. Wait.

08:20.650 --> 08:22.024
Fuck.

08:29.031 --> 08:31.420
-Rowena.
-Grace. Shit, you scared me.

08:31.622 --> 08:33.246
You didn't return my phone calls.

08:33.445 --> 08:36.346
Well, yeah, I've been pretty busy
working out of town.

08:36.549 --> 08:41.337
Oh, yeah. The Senator Sachs scandal.
Don't worry. I didn't tell anyone.

08:41.539 --> 08:43.393
Besides, I got a better story for you.

08:43.586 --> 08:45.724
It's about Harrison Hill.

08:45.921 --> 08:48.441
-Come on.
-We met online.

08:48.833 --> 08:50.109
We did.

08:50.303 --> 08:53.237
He was giving a Q and A, I e-mailed
him and told him how great it was.

08:53.439 --> 08:56.699
You know, stroke a man's dick
and you get him for one night.

08:57.277 --> 09:00.342
Stroke his ego,
you get him for life, huh?

09:00.988 --> 09:03.322
Yeah, we sort of struck up
a friendship online...

09:03.516 --> 09:05.173
...but I could tell that he liked me.

09:05.371 --> 09:08.566
So I decided to come to New York
and accidentally bump into him.

09:08.762 --> 09:11.030
I knew about his fundraiser,
so I bought a ticket...

09:11.225 --> 09:15.347
...walked right up to him and said,
"Harrison, it's Fast Filly."'

09:16.919 --> 09:18.861
I thought he was gonna be angry.

09:19.062 --> 09:22.160
But instead, he's turned on by it.

09:22.357 --> 09:24.299
He likes the balls of it.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.288
"Stick around," he says.

09:26.484 --> 09:29.450
Couple hours later, we're doing it
in his Beemer, his hotel suite.

09:29.650 --> 09:30.992
He keeps one, creep.

09:32.146 --> 09:33.771
What happened to Chuck?

09:33.969 --> 09:35.627
We're fighting more
than we're fucking.

09:37.936 --> 09:40.869
Anyway, I get back to Philly,
our online stuff gets pretty hot.

09:41.071 --> 09:42.183
He misses me.

09:42.382 --> 09:44.291
I mean, he practically begs me
to move here.

09:44.494 --> 09:46.316
So I check out apartments
and agencies...

09:46.509 --> 09:48.898
...and I wanna tell him, you know,
I'm really excited.

09:49.100 --> 09:52.895
But suddenly,
I can't get ahold of him.

09:53.835 --> 09:57.282
I mean, I sent him a million e-mails
and he just cuts me off.

09:57.481 --> 10:00.033
Cold. Fucker.

10:01.192 --> 10:02.533
I know where Hill lives.

10:03.944 --> 10:06.048
I've seen his Armani wife.

10:06.759 --> 10:08.733
He has no idea what I can do
to him.

10:09.478 --> 10:12.543
What is it you want from me this time,
Grace?

10:12.740 --> 10:15.739
Actions have consequences, Ro.

10:15.939 --> 10:17.727
You can't just forget people.

10:17.923 --> 10:21.021
Bury them and pretend like
they never existed.

10:21.218 --> 10:23.105
It always comes back to haunt you.

10:23.297 --> 10:27.125
I wonder what Hill would think if David
Shane publishes a few of his e-mails?

10:27.328 --> 10:29.302
I'm sure the wife would find them
interesting.

10:32.126 --> 10:33.587
Take them. Read them.

10:33.790 --> 10:36.855
Because I'm about an inch away
from ringing this guy's doorbell.

10:37.052 --> 10:38.961
Regards to your mother.

11:01.876 --> 11:05.803
I know where Hill lives.
I've seen his Armani wife.

11:06.450 --> 11:09.199
He has no idea what
I can do to him.

11:11.345 --> 11:14.791
To David Shane. May this article
bring you all the prizes you deserve.

11:14.992 --> 11:18.307
And when you win the Pulitzer,
don't forget the little people.

11:51.108 --> 11:53.246
Here comes the beep.
you know what to do.

11:54.210 --> 11:57.504
Hey, Ro, it's Miles, again.
I've been calling for like a week.

11:57.697 --> 12:00.762
Are you looking for a job?
If you are, come on, take me with you.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.716
Guess what,
my sister had a boy, Fletcher.

12:02.911 --> 12:05.910
How cool is that? I fly home
in an hour. Call me later, please.

12:06.111 --> 12:09.721
I hate Narron too.
Narron's a dick. Bye.

12:14.875 --> 12:17.176
Here comes the beep.
you know what to do.

12:18.106 --> 12:21.749
Ro, it's Elizabeth Clayton.
Grace's mother.

12:21.977 --> 12:23.286
-I need help.
-Elizabeth.

12:23.481 --> 12:24.855
-Hi.
-Ro? It's Grace.

12:25.048 --> 12:27.982
She's missing. They started calling
from her agency last week.

12:28.183 --> 12:31.444
She goes to New york a lot and
I thought maybe she contacted you.

12:31.638 --> 12:34.157
It's just that I filed
a missing person's report.

12:34.357 --> 12:35.666
A woman drowned in New york.

12:35.861 --> 12:38.729
- They asked for dental records.
-Elizabeth, hang on a second.

12:38.931 --> 12:40.818
-I saw Grace last week.
-Oh, thank God.

12:41.011 --> 12:44.174
-Spare yourself a trip.
-But if it is-- If I weren't there--

12:44.369 --> 12:48.645
I know half the people at the city
morgue. This is not Grace, I promise.

12:48.848 --> 12:50.855
I'll call you when I get back.

12:52.047 --> 12:54.631
Hi, I'm Rowena Price.
Here to lD a body.

12:56.366 --> 12:59.267
Whoever did this tried to weigh
the body down.

12:59.468 --> 13:00.777
Amateur move.

13:00.972 --> 13:03.590
-Why is that?
-Didn't work.

13:04.171 --> 13:05.414
Fair warning.

13:05.898 --> 13:07.807
This isn't pretty.

13:11.369 --> 13:12.579
We're guessing an anchor...

13:12.776 --> 13:15.677
...or some sharp metal debris
ripped off the face and neck.

13:15.880 --> 13:19.294
So we're hoping that you could
identify something else.

13:19.654 --> 13:22.555
She has a birthmark, scars...

13:22.885 --> 13:24.794
...and it looks like a tattoo--

13:51.740 --> 13:53.528
Hi, Rowena.

13:55.898 --> 13:57.719
Do you wanna play?

14:00.121 --> 14:01.778
Well, are you coming?

14:03.512 --> 14:04.918
Let's go around back.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.163
I live up there.

14:17.554 --> 14:21.928
you do everything you can to protect
your children.

14:22.257 --> 14:24.012
Right schools, right opportunities.

14:24.816 --> 14:27.499
But it's all an illusion.
Nobody's safe.

14:27.695 --> 14:29.637
Who would do this to my daughter?

14:29.838 --> 14:31.747
We're gonna find out, Mrs. Clayton.

14:31.949 --> 14:33.640
Do you mind if I ask you
a few questions?

14:33.837 --> 14:36.422
-Can you excuse us?
-No. She's a friend of the family.

14:38.475 --> 14:40.995
Do you know if your daughter
had been seeing anyone?

14:41.194 --> 14:42.306
Yeah.

14:42.506 --> 14:44.098
Chuck. Chuck Freeman.

14:44.298 --> 14:45.759
But they'd been having trouble.

14:45.961 --> 14:47.684
Yeah, she told me that too.

14:47.880 --> 14:49.603
I ran into her on the subway
last week...

14:49.800 --> 14:52.166
...she mentioned
that they were having fights.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.213
Was that the last time you saw her?

14:54.406 --> 14:55.453
Yeah.

14:55.654 --> 14:59.427
I mean, I tried to call her, but she was
in the middle of something, and....

14:59.684 --> 15:02.498
Well, I wish now I had tried
a little bit harder.

15:02.692 --> 15:03.804
Oh, I know, honey.

15:04.003 --> 15:07.036
They knew each other
since they were kids.

15:08.034 --> 15:11.294
You were so close, you two,
especially after your father--

15:11.489 --> 15:13.114
Yeah, I know.

15:13.312 --> 15:16.726
Well, you were always so good to me
and my mother.

15:16.927 --> 15:17.854
So was Grace.

15:22.013 --> 15:25.176
Mrs. Clayton, we're gonna need you
to sign some papers downstairs.

15:25.372 --> 15:26.582
Certainly.

15:26.779 --> 15:28.601
I'll be just a minute.

15:30.362 --> 15:31.888
Ro.

15:32.762 --> 15:35.860
You know, Grace was so proud
of you.

15:36.312 --> 15:39.660
She saved all your articles.
She bragged about you.

15:40.375 --> 15:42.829
How did she know
that I was David Shane?

15:43.030 --> 15:45.363
I assumed you told her.

15:48.308 --> 15:49.966
I probably did.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.111
Thank you.

15:52.307 --> 15:55.601
The police are gonna find out
exactly who did this.

15:56.338 --> 15:58.344
I'll make sure they do.

15:59.121 --> 16:00.844
Thank you, honey.

16:06.606 --> 16:07.947
Hey.

16:08.653 --> 16:10.344
Hey, Miles.

16:12.300 --> 16:14.155
Let me get the key.

16:14.347 --> 16:17.445
I'm usually a key-above-the-door
kind of guy.

16:20.138 --> 16:21.544
-Hey, Miles.
-Yeah.

16:21.737 --> 16:24.606
When was the last time
you saw Grace?

16:26.887 --> 16:29.276
Oh, God, you know me
and dates, l--

16:29.479 --> 16:31.267
All right, well, roughly. A week?

16:31.461 --> 16:34.275
A month? A year?
Five years? What?

16:34.469 --> 16:36.672
Yeah, something like that. Why?

16:37.348 --> 16:38.722
Because.

16:38.916 --> 16:41.402
Just because I cut somebody out
of my life...

16:41.603 --> 16:44.700
...doesn't mean I expect you
to cut them out of yours.

16:44.897 --> 16:47.962
-Well, maybe you do.
-All right, maybe I do.

16:48.544 --> 16:51.063
-Why you got to keep it a secret?
-We exchanged e-mails...

16:51.263 --> 16:54.709
...a couple times. I was only nice to
her because she was a friend of yours.

16:54.910 --> 16:56.916
So you told her I was David Shane?

16:57.981 --> 17:00.119
Yeah. Busted.

17:00.316 --> 17:02.650
Could you be serious for five
fucking minutes?

17:02.843 --> 17:05.810
I'll bet you told her
about Senator Sachs too, didn't you?

17:06.010 --> 17:08.627
I stopped associating with her
when she fucked your boyfriend.

17:08.826 --> 17:09.752
Ask him who told her.

17:09.944 --> 17:12.911
You need to stay in your own
fucking lane, that's what I think.

17:13.112 --> 17:16.275
You just better leave Cam out of it.
I mean it, Miles.

17:16.471 --> 17:19.284
Ro, I'm sorry.
I was being insensitive.

17:19.478 --> 17:21.365
Ro, I'm sorry.

17:21.557 --> 17:25.201
It's just-- I was the one
who was left picking up the pieces...

17:25.396 --> 17:28.592
...after Grace and Cameron
tore you apart and l-- And l--

17:31.954 --> 17:35.727
Yeah. So, what do the police say?

17:35.920 --> 17:39.596
They're chasing a lead on some guy
she was dating in Philly.

17:40.046 --> 17:41.901
But I have another idea.

17:42.094 --> 17:43.174
Why's that?

17:43.885 --> 17:46.056
Because I saw Grace last week.

17:49.451 --> 17:51.076
Oh, I'm the one
who's keeping secrets?

17:51.275 --> 17:53.478
She wanted me to chase down
Harrison Hill.

17:53.675 --> 17:55.048
Harrison Hill, Harrison Hill?

17:55.242 --> 17:57.510
Yes, that Harrison Hill.
Here, take a look at this.

17:57.705 --> 17:59.493
She was threatening
to go to his wife.

17:59.689 --> 18:01.249
Apparently, they met online
in July...

18:01.448 --> 18:03.935
...and had one hell of a weekend
in September.

18:04.135 --> 18:06.142
I mean, that's assuming
he is ADEX.

18:06.342 --> 18:07.290
-Wait. Who? Who?
-ADEX.

18:07.494 --> 18:09.729
The guy she's been e-mailing,
ADEX.

18:09.925 --> 18:12.095
I mean, it tracks.
Harrison Hill owns...

18:12.292 --> 18:15.607
...the biggest ad agency
in New York City?

18:15.811 --> 18:20.446
"I'm gonna fuck you so hard,
I'm gonna split you in half."

18:21.793 --> 18:24.094
Oh, my.

18:25.823 --> 18:27.481
Oh, my God.

18:30.686 --> 18:33.336
Wait a minute, Ro.
This is not a story.

18:33.533 --> 18:38.420
Miles, I would love, love, love to get
my hands on the rest of these e-mails.

18:38.619 --> 18:41.815
Because the way I see it, Grace was
fucking Hill, he dumped her...

18:42.010 --> 18:45.075
...she got pissed, threatened to go
to the wife, and she wound up dead.

18:45.273 --> 18:46.352
I mean, come on.

18:46.553 --> 18:48.559
-It's simple, that's it.
-This is Harrison Hill.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.832
If he wanted somebody dead,
he won't do it hims--

18:51.031 --> 18:53.900
-That's just the first of all.
-She was stalking the guy.

18:54.102 --> 18:57.516
She sent him a million e-mails.
She probably even went to his house.

18:57.717 --> 18:58.993
Who knows?

18:59.189 --> 19:02.417
All it takes to commit a murder...

19:02.611 --> 19:06.123
...are the right ingredients
at the right time.

19:10.001 --> 19:12.204
Son of a bitch.

19:13.967 --> 19:15.723
-Hey, where are you?
-G.W. Bridge.

19:15.918 --> 19:17.325
Why? What's up?

19:17.519 --> 19:20.103
I got into Grace's Hotmail account.
It's her main one.

19:20.302 --> 19:22.406
There's a shitload of guys in there,
by the way.

19:22.605 --> 19:24.033
But none of them are ADEX.

19:24.236 --> 19:26.145
But that's not the account
I gave you, Miles.

19:26.347 --> 19:30.340
Well, hold on. And then I looked at her
other account, FastFilly@iol.com...

19:30.538 --> 19:34.082
...and guess who's all up in her box?
ADEX. Ro.

19:34.601 --> 19:36.902
-Yeah?
-You got to read some of this shit.

19:37.096 --> 19:38.589
I wanna read it all, Miles.

19:38.792 --> 19:41.246
Okay. So, I'm gonna bring over
everything after work.

19:41.446 --> 19:44.162
And, Ro, we still don't know
that ADEX is Hill.

19:44.357 --> 19:46.560
And we still don't know
that he's not.

19:46.980 --> 19:47.907
Yeah.

20:25.144 --> 20:27.696
Hey, your dinner's getting warm.

20:34.485 --> 20:35.793
Hold it.

20:36.372 --> 20:39.983
Can I just say for the record, wow.

20:42.834 --> 20:46.379
Can I also say that's just a ridiculous
outfit to be wearing for takeout?

20:46.577 --> 20:48.464
Well, I didn't know
you were bringing takeout.

20:48.655 --> 20:50.662
Well, I didn't know you had a date.

20:50.927 --> 20:53.577
-Oh, God.
-Who's the...?

20:53.774 --> 20:55.878
Who's the lucky guy?

20:56.749 --> 20:58.887
Can we just look at the e-mails,
please?

20:59.084 --> 21:01.091
Sure. Yeah. Here, here.
Have a seat.

21:01.868 --> 21:03.209
Okay.

21:07.049 --> 21:08.772
So yeah.

21:09.193 --> 21:13.567
You told me that Grace wanted you
to threaten Hill.

21:13.767 --> 21:17.344
Well, she was doing it without you
for a while. Listen. This, this--

21:17.542 --> 21:20.574
This e-mail's a week old
and it's her last one.

21:20.773 --> 21:23.193
"Harrison, if you don't," capital,
"pay attention to me...

21:23.397 --> 21:25.567
...you're going to," capital,
"pay the price.

21:25.764 --> 21:28.283
I'm in the city
and I know your wife's away.

21:28.483 --> 21:31.711
Meet with me now,
or I'll meet with her later."

21:31.905 --> 21:35.133
So Grace knew that the wife
was out of town.

21:35.328 --> 21:37.880
You're going under the assumption
that Grace actually knew...

21:38.079 --> 21:40.184
...what she was talking about,
which is a mistake.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.487
By the way, even though she calls
ADEX Harrison...

21:42.686 --> 21:45.881
...it doesn't prove that it's Harrison
Hill. It's not proof enough to print.

21:46.077 --> 21:48.018
Okay. So how do we prove it?

21:48.220 --> 21:49.845
Well, technically we can't prove it...

21:50.043 --> 21:52.148
...but if we can get ADEX
to send us an e-mail...

21:52.346 --> 21:56.174
...I can tail it, jimmy the lock, and then
take a closer look into his account.

21:57.496 --> 21:59.983
You are amazing.

22:01.112 --> 22:03.086
I love you, man.

22:03.575 --> 22:06.225
This is just such an obstruction
of justice.

22:06.422 --> 22:09.203
No, no, no.
This is the pursuit of justice.

22:09.397 --> 22:11.949
I'll make you a deal.
We get anything concrete on Hill...

22:12.148 --> 22:14.602
...we'll go to the cops
and to Narron on the same day.

22:14.803 --> 22:16.591
They get their man.
We get our story.

22:16.787 --> 22:18.412
But even if ADEX turns out
to be Hill...

22:18.609 --> 22:20.812
...it's not a crime to chat nor cheat.

22:21.009 --> 22:24.270
But it is a crime to be walking out
on a feast like this in that outfit.

22:24.464 --> 22:26.406
And yet, I have to because I'm late.

22:26.607 --> 22:28.711
So you finish up.
I'll see you tomorrow.

22:28.910 --> 22:31.048
Shut the door. It locks by itself.

22:31.245 --> 22:32.903
Have fun.

22:40.042 --> 22:41.569
Harrison Hill.

22:45.513 --> 22:46.658
Oh, there you are.

22:58.757 --> 23:00.283
Cam.

23:00.483 --> 23:01.465
-Oh, Cam.
-Come here.

23:01.667 --> 23:03.968
-You are naughty.
-Come on.

23:09.984 --> 23:11.391
Come here.

23:13.887 --> 23:15.861
Oh, yeah.

23:17.022 --> 23:18.331
Yeah.

23:32.121 --> 23:34.063
-You like that?
-Yes, baby.

23:34.265 --> 23:36.752
Oh, come on. Say it.

23:41.270 --> 23:43.790
Yeah, oh, yeah.

23:43.989 --> 23:45.876
You like it? You like that?

23:46.069 --> 23:48.337
Yeah, good.

23:53.682 --> 23:54.925
I need to get closer to Hill.

23:55.122 --> 23:58.023
Hello, Miles. How are you?
Fine. you? Thanks.

23:58.224 --> 23:59.882
Hello, Miles. How are you?
Fine. You?

24:00.079 --> 24:01.672
Okay, I need to get closer to Hill.

24:01.871 --> 24:03.431
Close as you got to Cam last night?

24:03.630 --> 24:06.150
It's a little soon to be going
on dates with Grace's ex.

24:06.349 --> 24:07.658
Oh, I'm sorry, your ex.

24:07.854 --> 24:09.227
Are you fucking spying on me now?

24:09.709 --> 24:11.530
No. A friend of mine saw you
two last night.

24:11.724 --> 24:13.033
And he said it looked friendly.

24:13.227 --> 24:14.601
What? You get him by default?

24:14.795 --> 24:18.023
Well, not that I owe you or
your friend an explanation.

24:18.217 --> 24:20.638
I wanted to see Cam. Somebody
had to tell him about Grace.

24:20.840 --> 24:22.945
Well, I guess we all
grieve differently.

24:23.144 --> 24:25.565
You know what, Miles? Forget it.

24:25.767 --> 24:27.807
If you don't wanna help me,
Terry wouldn't mind.

24:28.007 --> 24:29.501
He's been dying to get
into research.

24:29.702 --> 24:32.319
Oh, Terry couldn't find his ass
with both hands and his ass.

24:33.445 --> 24:35.451
All right, fine, fine, fine.
I'll play nice.

24:36.420 --> 24:37.597
Okay. Good.

24:38.275 --> 24:39.932
While you look around
in cyberspace...

24:40.131 --> 24:42.235
...I need to be looking around
at my new job...

24:42.434 --> 24:44.538
...that you, clever friend,
are going to get me.

24:44.737 --> 24:46.362
Oh, God love you.

24:46.560 --> 24:49.112
Something temporary.
Easy in, easy out. Can you do that?

24:49.312 --> 24:51.732
Does a bear shit in the woods?
H2A's got a blade server...

24:51.935 --> 24:54.803
...that gives more entry points
than a college girl at Mardi Gras.

24:55.005 --> 24:57.394
I'll access the needs list they send
to temp agencies.

24:57.597 --> 24:59.571
Shouldn't be too hard.
There's always openings.

24:59.772 --> 25:02.292
-And, hey, wear something sexy.
-What?

25:02.491 --> 25:03.571
You need to bait the hook.

25:04.154 --> 25:06.739
Just make sure I'm working for Hill.

25:06.938 --> 25:08.879
yeah, your new name
will be Katherine Pogue.

25:09.080 --> 25:10.705
I choose my own names.

25:10.904 --> 25:13.838
Well, tough. I had a crush on a girl
in high school named Katherine.

25:14.039 --> 25:15.413
It's an homage.

25:15.606 --> 25:17.995
-Going to H2A.
-H2A.

25:18.229 --> 25:21.425
Hill's a Jersey native who slipped
and fell into a big pile of money...

25:21.620 --> 25:24.434
-... when he married--
-Mia Rheinhart Hill.

25:24.628 --> 25:27.856
She's also the daughter of Max
Rheinhart, principal owner of H2A.

25:28.051 --> 25:29.228
-There you go.
-Thank you.

25:29.426 --> 25:31.531
Now, if you'll follow me.

25:33.105 --> 25:35.821
Hard to separate a man
from his wife's money.

25:36.016 --> 25:37.990
Money is the root of all evil, Miles.

25:38.926 --> 25:40.649
Check your scriptures.

25:40.846 --> 25:43.528
Love of money is the root of all evil,
Ro.

25:44.013 --> 25:45.322
Love.

25:46.316 --> 25:48.966
We have a new temp.
Her name is Katherine Pogue.

25:49.164 --> 25:50.373
-Hi.
-Hi.

25:50.763 --> 25:52.420
Thank you. I'll show you
to your desk.

25:52.874 --> 25:54.499
And press 9 to get out,
3 to reach me.

25:54.697 --> 25:57.991
I'll be right across from you. You
shouldn't have a problem finding me.

26:04.167 --> 26:06.533
Katherine, we need a coffee setup
in Conference Room A.

26:06.725 --> 26:08.416
-Will I be working for Mr. Hill?
-No.

26:08.613 --> 26:10.881
I'm working for Mr. Hill.
You're working for me.

26:11.076 --> 26:14.752
And you'd better roll up your sleeves.
We are short-staffed this week.

26:19.170 --> 26:22.016
Sensational, Harrison. Really.

26:22.209 --> 26:23.452
Spectacular.

26:23.648 --> 26:27.356
I hear you're thinking about opening
in Amsterdam, by the way.

26:27.551 --> 26:30.899
-Yes, we did. In April.
-Really?

26:31.102 --> 26:32.050
Excuse me, Mr. Hill.

26:32.253 --> 26:35.002
Mr. Kirschenbaum's car is downstairs
and your 2:00 is waiting.

26:35.196 --> 26:37.050
Thanks, Esmeralda.

26:37.435 --> 26:39.606
-I'll walk you out, Jon.
-Great. Thanks.

26:39.802 --> 26:42.932
You're doing well.
I'm very proud of you.

26:43.481 --> 26:46.065
I couldn't have done it without you.
I learned from the best.

26:46.264 --> 26:47.922
-I appreciate it.
-Thanks for coming by.

26:48.120 --> 26:50.159
Listen, this is probably
just bullshit...

26:50.359 --> 26:54.449
...but one of my guys heard that a
couple of your execs were in Canton...

26:54.645 --> 26:56.717
...sniffing around
my Reebok account.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.217
If you're sure it's bullshit,
why are you asking me?

26:59.636 --> 27:02.734
Because they heard about it
from inside your agency.

27:03.442 --> 27:06.311
I just don't want you to make that kind
of mistake, Harrison.

27:06.513 --> 27:09.262
I've been representing Reebok
for 1 1 years.

27:09.456 --> 27:10.503
They're my main account.

27:10.704 --> 27:14.826
They're not gonna jump ship for your
smile and some downtown hype.

27:18.126 --> 27:21.737
Eat or be eaten. Right, Jon?

27:21.932 --> 27:23.720
Isn't that what you always told me?

27:23.916 --> 27:26.184
Now, you left the Reebok account out
on the table.

27:26.379 --> 27:29.956
If I didn't pick it up, someone else
was going to and you know that.

27:30.153 --> 27:33.600
Ten years ago you wouldn't have let
this happen. You fumbled the ball.

27:33.800 --> 27:36.417
You really are that stupid.

27:36.615 --> 27:38.949
Give my regards to Vanessa.

27:41.510 --> 27:43.037
Esmeralda.

27:49.379 --> 27:52.226
We have a leak to
Kirschenbaum and Bond.

27:52.419 --> 27:55.996
I wanna find out who the fuck it is.
Right now.

27:58.017 --> 27:59.609
Hold the door, please.

28:02.079 --> 28:05.339
-Wait. Thank you.
-That was close.

28:08.509 --> 28:11.442
Harrison, will you be attending
the Victoria's Secret meeting tonight?

28:11.644 --> 28:13.748
I was hoping maybe I could catch
a ride.

28:13.947 --> 28:16.150
-Yeah, I think I'll be going.
-Okay.

28:38.771 --> 28:40.592
Keep the meter running.

29:02.603 --> 29:04.936
We can go now.
74th and Broadway, please.

29:22.916 --> 29:24.541
Rowena.

29:27.427 --> 29:29.019
Rowena.

29:31.745 --> 29:34.199
Rowena.

29:36.799 --> 29:38.587
Got you.

29:45.245 --> 29:48.277
You know how much
Daddy likes bath time.

29:59.863 --> 30:01.870
We have a Victoria's Secret
party tonight.

30:02.071 --> 30:05.136
-Good morning, Esmeralda.
-Good morning, Katherine.

30:05.334 --> 30:09.009
Two hundred guests,
200 gift bags, too little time.

30:09.204 --> 30:12.519
Five items per bag. Have fun.

30:23.728 --> 30:26.509
-Miles, what? I'm at work.
-Well, it wasn't just a drowning.

30:27.086 --> 30:28.515
She was poisoned.

30:28.718 --> 30:30.856
She had a hole in her gut the size
of a fruit bowl.

30:31.053 --> 30:32.646
Oh, come on.

30:32.844 --> 30:35.331
No, that's a direct quote
from the examiner's office.

30:35.531 --> 30:37.473
The killer also put it in her eyes...

30:38.283 --> 30:40.105
...which is weird.

30:41.194 --> 30:44.040
Ro, they haven't announced it yet...

30:44.776 --> 30:46.052
...but Grace was pregnant.

30:47.016 --> 30:49.437
She was in her first trimester.

30:49.639 --> 30:52.060
Hello. I'm Gina.

30:52.262 --> 30:55.108
-Ro?
-Katherine Pogue, are you in here?

30:55.301 --> 30:57.275
Oh, there you are.

30:58.244 --> 31:01.146
I could tell you Victoria's secret,
but then I'd have to kill you.

31:01.347 --> 31:02.274
-Clever, huh?
-Yeah.

31:02.467 --> 31:05.215
Mr. Hill came up with it for the
"Very Sexy Collection" launch.

31:06.305 --> 31:07.679
Very sexy.

31:07.873 --> 31:09.596
And in a rainbow of colors.

31:10.848 --> 31:12.636
Here, keep a few for the home fires.

31:12.831 --> 31:14.805
I know a pretty girl like you
has a boyfriend.

31:15.007 --> 31:17.079
-No.
-Girlfriend?

31:18.398 --> 31:20.088
-Pets?
-No.

31:20.284 --> 31:23.131
Well, we've got some
local talent here.

31:23.324 --> 31:27.381
I'll say. What's up with Hill?
He's interesting.

31:27.962 --> 31:28.976
Married.

31:29.658 --> 31:32.472
Rumor is, and you didn't hear it
from me...

31:32.664 --> 31:36.308
...he had a couple of interoffice flings
a few years back, led to lawsuits.

31:36.503 --> 31:38.869
Paid a lot of money
to make them go away.

31:39.062 --> 31:41.876
That's when he got his front girl
to run interference.

31:42.069 --> 31:43.378
That would be Josie.

31:44.149 --> 31:47.530
Or, if you get on her bad side,
Cujosie.

31:47.732 --> 31:50.186
She's his gatekeeper.
His walking hard drive.

31:50.386 --> 31:53.614
So he never forgets a name,
an account, an enemy.

31:53.809 --> 31:56.077
No one gets to him now
without going through her.

31:56.273 --> 31:58.345
Let me guess, he's done her too,
right?

31:58.544 --> 32:00.910
Oh, no. No.

32:01.103 --> 32:04.484
She'd be more interested in you than
in him, if you catch my heavy drift.

32:05.229 --> 32:06.571
I think I do.

32:06.765 --> 32:09.033
She's his watchdog, not his bitch.

32:09.228 --> 32:12.227
-The guy's reformed, unfortunately.
-Right.

32:12.875 --> 32:14.697
His wife's all over him.

32:14.890 --> 32:16.744
She's got eyes in the back
of your head.

32:16.938 --> 32:17.865
Trust me.

32:18.057 --> 32:23.358
She finds him cheating,
she and her money are out the door.

32:23.559 --> 32:24.900
See Jesse Drake over there?

32:25.095 --> 32:27.844
He had this blond temp last fall
could melt butter.

32:28.038 --> 32:30.656
Her name was Veronica.

32:30.853 --> 32:32.740
One day, the boss's wife comes in...

32:32.932 --> 32:35.801
...sees Mr. H and Veronica talking
close over the Sparkletts...

32:36.003 --> 32:38.686
...the next day the temp's toast.

32:38.882 --> 32:40.921
The boy's been leashed.

32:41.122 --> 32:44.416
But since I have it on good authority
he's into some very kinky shit.

32:44.609 --> 32:46.779
He probably likes the tight collar.

32:48.639 --> 32:50.526
I'd let him give me a little spank.

32:51.454 --> 32:54.006
-Did I just say that out loud?
-You're sick.

33:03.578 --> 33:04.952
Sorry.

33:05.978 --> 33:07.155
I didn't mean to scare you.

33:07.352 --> 33:08.661
Sorry.

33:10.231 --> 33:11.954
You're Katherine, right?

33:12.151 --> 33:15.019
And you're Harrison Hill, the boss.

33:15.606 --> 33:17.035
Yes.

33:18.069 --> 33:19.563
It's good to be the boss.

33:20.053 --> 33:21.426
Yeah.

33:22.068 --> 33:25.416
So I'll see you at the party tonight,
Katherine.

33:56.329 --> 33:57.986
Here we go.

34:04.710 --> 34:09.018
On behalf of Victoria's Secret, I would
like to thank our very special angel...

34:09.221 --> 34:12.699
...Harrison Hill, for making us
sexier than ever.

34:14.594 --> 34:16.001
Harrison.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.138
I have no idea how we could
possibly make...

34:22.335 --> 34:24.408
...you look any sexier than you do
tonight, Heidi.

34:24.607 --> 34:26.679
Thank you so very much.

34:26.878 --> 34:31.132
I'd just like to raise a glass
to everyone at Victoria's Secret...

34:31.324 --> 34:33.690
...and all my people at H2A...

34:33.884 --> 34:35.770
...for making this
a successful campaign...

34:35.963 --> 34:40.467
...a Very Sexy Collection
is H2A's most sexful--

34:41.880 --> 34:44.052
Succsexf--

34:47.000 --> 34:48.592
We did really good
with this campaign.

34:48.791 --> 34:51.507
Happy Valentine's Day.
God bless you.

34:53.014 --> 34:54.737
Thank you. Good night.

34:56.437 --> 34:59.436
So is part of the torture the fact
we get to watch all this fun?

34:59.635 --> 35:01.936
Are you kidding me?
We got the best seats in the house.

35:02.130 --> 35:05.446
Okay, see the guy with the bad
combover standing by the statues?

35:05.649 --> 35:07.623
Bob Milstein, Accounting.

35:07.824 --> 35:09.417
He may look unlucky in love.

35:09.616 --> 35:12.517
He recently nailed Kay Rolands,
Sales...

35:12.719 --> 35:15.139
...the giant standing by the shrimp.

35:15.726 --> 35:19.434
-Corporate America, ain't it grand?
-One big happy family, eh?

35:19.629 --> 35:22.727
Who's the loud-laughing brunette?
The one that looks a little tipsy.

35:22.923 --> 35:27.177
Oh, Bethany Lee, account manager.

35:27.370 --> 35:30.816
Long legs, perfect teeth,
may they rot in hell.

35:32.137 --> 35:33.729
A few years back
there was chatter...

35:33.927 --> 35:37.668
...she and Mr. Hill were going over
more than just the company numbers.

35:37.863 --> 35:38.877
-Really?
-Yeah.

35:39.079 --> 35:41.761
But that was before the lawsuits,
before Cujosie...

35:41.958 --> 35:44.575
...and before the wife
started paying attention.

35:44.772 --> 35:48.088
Now it's all hugs and kisses
and they're going to fertility clinics.

35:48.291 --> 35:49.981
I think her oven's on the fritz.

35:50.818 --> 35:53.021
Is there anything you don't know,
Gina?

35:53.218 --> 35:54.646
No.

35:55.040 --> 35:57.690
I don't get it. Mrs. Hill is pretty.

35:57.888 --> 35:59.448
I mean, she's really pretty.

35:59.647 --> 36:04.348
Show me a beautiful woman, I'll show
you a man who's tired of fucking her.

36:04.541 --> 36:07.290
-Nice, Gina.
-What? I've got brothers.

36:12.955 --> 36:14.777
Hi.

36:14.970 --> 36:16.595
Hey.

36:19.192 --> 36:21.264
You're embarrassing him
and yourself.

36:21.464 --> 36:23.503
Okay, I'll be better.

36:23.703 --> 36:26.964
His wife is out there.

36:27.158 --> 36:28.685
I'm sorry.

36:28.885 --> 36:30.510
I'm sorry.

36:30.773 --> 36:32.877
Here's money for a cab.

36:33.588 --> 36:35.016
Come on.

36:35.731 --> 36:39.658
-He'll call me, right?
-Good night, Bethany, good night.

36:54.669 --> 36:56.807
I told you already, Narron, I quit.

36:57.004 --> 36:59.873
I figured two weeks was enough
to let you cool off.

37:00.075 --> 37:01.765
I gotta go.

37:02.954 --> 37:05.320
I'm sorry about the senator, Ro,
but I can't lose you.

37:05.513 --> 37:08.381
-David Shane is this paper's star.
-You don't bench a star, Narron.

37:08.584 --> 37:11.365
There will always be powerful people
covering things up, Ro...

37:11.560 --> 37:13.446
...at every paper, in every city.

37:13.638 --> 37:15.809
It's called editorializing
and it's a reality.

37:16.613 --> 37:18.368
Don't give up
because one son of a bitch...

37:18.565 --> 37:21.248
...pulled some strings at the paper
and silenced your source.

37:21.444 --> 37:24.443
Rest up, come back...

37:24.643 --> 37:27.098
...and nail the next son of a bitch.

37:29.313 --> 37:30.589
Maybe.

37:30.785 --> 37:33.784
So I set up your lOL account,
but you're gonna need a name.

37:34.432 --> 37:36.406
How about Rocket?

37:36.607 --> 37:38.876
That was my nickname
from college.

37:39.070 --> 37:41.917
Are you sure you don't wanna be
"Hot Bitch on Wheels"?

37:42.780 --> 37:48.245
No, I'm kidding.
All right, Rocket, Rocket, "Rocketgirl."

37:48.443 --> 37:52.184
A little sexier than
DShane@NYCourier.com.

37:52.377 --> 37:54.515
So I put ADEX...

37:56.153 --> 38:00.591
...into your friends file
and as a little extra added bonus...

38:00.791 --> 38:04.205
...your computer has a few things
to say. Listen, this is good.

38:05.333 --> 38:06.707
Miles is sexy.

38:08.789 --> 38:10.250
Miles is sexy.

38:11.827 --> 38:13.615
-Translation?
-Let me guess.

38:13.810 --> 38:14.890
Miles is sexy?

38:15.090 --> 38:18.384
-You think so?
-And I need this, why?

38:18.577 --> 38:19.951
Because it's fucking radical.

38:20.145 --> 38:22.446
Every time you get an lM,
you'll have a voice to match.

38:22.639 --> 38:25.060
I don't want my computer talking.
I don't want it saying:

38:25.262 --> 38:27.749
-"Miles is sexy."
-I'll just give an audio to Hill.

38:27.950 --> 38:30.021
I sampled his voice
from some streaming video.

38:30.221 --> 38:32.522
-You don't mind if Hill talks?
-Do I have a choice?

38:32.716 --> 38:34.276
No.

38:38.474 --> 38:40.197
So, what's he like up close
and personal?

38:40.394 --> 38:44.287
Well, tell you one thing,
there's more to the guy than you think.

38:44.488 --> 38:45.950
You should check out his offices.

38:46.152 --> 38:47.362
Go online, take the tour.

38:47.559 --> 38:50.046
You'll see. It's outrageous.

38:51.046 --> 38:53.729
Sick. Just what you'd like.

38:53.925 --> 38:57.666
Oh, you know what, by the way,
I did find something out. Apparently...

38:57.860 --> 39:01.175
...Hill has squashed a couple
of sexual harassment suits.

39:01.378 --> 39:03.385
-Could you chase the money trail?
-Yeah, well...

39:03.586 --> 39:05.528
...I guess he's a likely
candidate for that.

39:05.729 --> 39:06.743
No, not really.

39:06.945 --> 39:08.984
He's now got this gorgeous
Amazonian woman...

39:09.184 --> 39:12.445
-...that does all the dirty work.
-Oh, really? Is she hot?

39:12.638 --> 39:13.848
Yes.

39:14.047 --> 39:18.518
She's very hot.
She's also a lesbian.

39:18.717 --> 39:20.342
Bastard.

39:21.308 --> 39:24.089
All right, so seeing
that you're a chat-room virgin....

39:24.283 --> 39:27.064
-Big deal, I'm a chat-room virgin.
-No, I think it's a compliment.

39:27.258 --> 39:30.192
I think you should practice
online flirting.

39:30.585 --> 39:34.096
-Why would I want to do that?
-Because you'll tell a perfect stranger...

39:34.296 --> 39:37.742
...something you won't tell your best
friend. Especially if you're anonymous.

39:37.942 --> 39:40.210
You should know that,
Mr. David Shane.

39:42.069 --> 39:44.818
Oh, by the way, I got a dollar that
says Hill's not our guy.

39:46.420 --> 39:49.997
We got a pregnant Grace,
threatening to go to the wife, right?

39:50.194 --> 39:53.935
-Yeah.
-Okay, but meanwhile, the wife...

39:54.129 --> 39:57.227
...is busy trying to haul Hill off
to a fertility clinic.

39:58.384 --> 40:02.790
And let's not forget the most
important part, the wife is the money.

40:02.990 --> 40:04.299
-Yeah.
-I don't know.

40:04.494 --> 40:05.737
That's motive on a big stick.

40:05.933 --> 40:08.583
-Motive on a big stick?
-That's what I said.

40:08.780 --> 40:11.746
So I'll take your bet.

40:11.947 --> 40:13.507
Game on.

40:16.362 --> 40:18.183
Welcome to chat.

40:19.241 --> 40:21.127
"Trublu?" Okay.

40:22.695 --> 40:24.189
Welcome.

40:24.743 --> 40:26.236
"Haven't seen you around."

40:27.589 --> 40:30.654
New to this. Who are you?

40:33.220 --> 40:36.066
Hello, Neil, I'm Tiffany.

40:42.177 --> 40:45.624
Okay, Trublu, let's go.

40:46.655 --> 40:50.844
How do you imagine me?

40:51.038 --> 40:53.339
"Long blond hair, longer legs--"

40:53.533 --> 40:55.769
Really close.

40:57.468 --> 40:58.874
Welcome.

40:59.227 --> 41:03.088
"When you said you were getting off,
I didn't know you meant literally."

41:03.290 --> 41:06.039
Leave me alone.

41:09.752 --> 41:13.493
I haven't contacted him.

41:16.181 --> 41:18.285
"l did on his--"

41:26.546 --> 41:28.618
-Hello.
-Okay, look, this isn't funny.

41:28.817 --> 41:31.882
-You're taking advantage of me.
-This is exactly what we talked about.

41:32.080 --> 41:33.803
Once he responds,
I get past his firewall.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.301
It's the price of admission.
I wrote, "Dear Harrison...

41:36.494 --> 41:39.177
...the answers are: Great sex,
cheap beer, the Rolling Stones."

41:39.373 --> 41:40.747
-What?
-Come on.

41:40.941 --> 41:44.039
We got to push his buttons. By the
way, I sent it from your account.

41:44.236 --> 41:46.123
Oh, shit. He's on.

41:46.316 --> 41:48.616
-There he is. Let me drive.
-He's on, Miles, he's on.

41:48.810 --> 41:50.948
-Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Miles.
-Harrison--

41:51.146 --> 41:53.217
-What are you doing?
-Nice to hear from you.

41:53.417 --> 41:56.350
Miles, you're typing for me?

41:56.552 --> 41:58.373
-It's a riddle.
-Miles. Stop it.

41:58.567 --> 42:00.705
-Miles, stop it.
-All right, fine. Fine. Fine.

42:00.902 --> 42:03.455
I'm through the firewall into ADEX's
account. He's all yours.

42:04.325 --> 42:06.779
Miles, you bastard.

42:08.164 --> 42:09.538
-What's your name?
-Shit.

42:17.665 --> 42:18.842
Veronica.

42:19.872 --> 42:21.562
What color is your hair?

42:22.367 --> 42:23.992
Blond.

42:25.055 --> 42:26.003
Dirty.

42:26.974 --> 42:29.046
I like dirty.

42:29.757 --> 42:31.283
Filthy.

42:31.485 --> 42:34.004
I'd like to get a fistful.

42:34.939 --> 42:35.887
Are you turned on?

42:36.123 --> 42:37.945
I am.

42:38.522 --> 42:40.048
Fucker.

42:44.152 --> 42:45.079
I should go.

42:45.272 --> 42:47.094
But you just warmed me up.

42:47.287 --> 42:49.174
Yeah. Don't blueball the guy.

42:49.367 --> 42:52.944
"Yeah, Ro. Don't blueball the guy."

42:55.828 --> 42:58.283
-I'll be back. Bye.
-Goodbye.

43:01.938 --> 43:04.010
Would you quit spying on me,
you fuck?

43:04.210 --> 43:06.991
You are officially in the way
of how I work and I'm not having it.

43:07.185 --> 43:09.966
-It's Hill. We can prove it now.
-Don't send e-mails on my behalf.

43:10.159 --> 43:12.166
And do not speak for me in any way.

43:12.366 --> 43:15.049
How about, "Thank you, Miles,
for your subversive genius"?

43:15.245 --> 43:17.700
Thank you. Bye.

43:21.707 --> 43:24.423
Good morning, H2A.
May I help you?

43:24.938 --> 43:26.628
-Hey, good morning.
-How are you?

43:26.826 --> 43:28.767
Good morning, H2A.

43:35.334 --> 43:37.156
Hello.

43:38.086 --> 43:40.190
"What happened to you last night?"

43:46.787 --> 43:48.031
Morning.

43:48.226 --> 43:50.397
"Tiffany? Veronica?"

43:50.593 --> 43:51.521
Katherine.

43:54.625 --> 43:56.729
You forgot to fill out your l-9.

43:57.536 --> 43:58.779
Okay.

43:58.975 --> 44:02.072
I told Human Resources
I'd run it right back over there...

44:02.270 --> 44:03.513
...now.

44:04.062 --> 44:07.377
Okay, well, I'll just fill this out.

44:07.580 --> 44:10.613
-You looking for permanent work?
-Always.

44:10.811 --> 44:11.923
Where have you temped?

44:12.507 --> 44:14.001
I don't know. Got a phone book?

44:14.202 --> 44:15.216
Yes, I do.

44:16.186 --> 44:17.527
Okay.

44:18.520 --> 44:21.137
Zaffman, Meyer and Pearce, l.P.E.--

44:21.336 --> 44:24.182
-I love the new building.
-Great bathrooms.

44:24.375 --> 44:26.229
What about Kirschenbaum
and Bond?

44:27.381 --> 44:28.810
Average bathrooms.

44:29.013 --> 44:30.507
When did you work there?

44:30.708 --> 44:32.431
I don't know, maybe April.

44:32.628 --> 44:34.863
I don't know. My life is kind of crazy.

44:35.059 --> 44:38.091
One day just runs into the next.

44:39.793 --> 44:41.549
Heineken Amsterdam
is gonna love it.

44:41.745 --> 44:44.330
We should start talking
about print, scheduling, tie-ins.

44:44.528 --> 44:46.186
It can play internationally too.

44:46.383 --> 44:50.212
Jesse, why don't you start talking
about media buys with Chuck...

44:50.414 --> 44:52.682
...Toni and Steve.
I need a couple minutes.

44:52.877 --> 44:54.698
-I'll be right back.
-I'm glad you're happy.

44:54.892 --> 44:56.353
So glad you're happy.

44:56.555 --> 44:58.921
When do you think we could roll it
to print?

45:01.706 --> 45:02.785
Here, hold this, please.

45:02.986 --> 45:04.992
Esmeralda, hold my calls
for a few minutes.

45:05.192 --> 45:07.745
Phelps. Mr. Phelps.

45:07.944 --> 45:08.871
Afternoon, boys.

45:09.064 --> 45:12.161
Kindly do me a favor and stand up,
would you? Get out!

45:12.359 --> 45:14.595
Piece of shit,
you're gonna spy on me?

45:15.653 --> 45:18.467
Here, get the fuck up,
you piece of sh--

45:19.268 --> 45:20.697
You were a fucking bike messenger.

45:20.899 --> 45:22.360
I made you rich.

45:22.564 --> 45:25.824
I hope they have a job for you
over at Kirschenbaum.

45:28.385 --> 45:30.621
I accept your resignation.

45:33.791 --> 45:35.165
Gunnar.

45:35.902 --> 45:38.803
Congratulations.
Now clean up your new office.

45:40.477 --> 45:43.062
Back to work.
What are you guys looking at?

45:43.260 --> 45:45.681
Shit. What just happened?

45:45.883 --> 45:48.600
Gunnar Hope just got a promotion.

45:51.354 --> 45:54.036
"Veronica, how did you know
about my ADEX account?"

45:59.511 --> 46:02.227
I used to temp at H2A.

46:08.372 --> 46:09.746
Yeah.

46:13.330 --> 46:16.111
My boyfriend wouldn't like that.

46:18.128 --> 46:19.437
Shit.

46:25.326 --> 46:27.365
Does this phone call mean
I'm forgiven?

46:27.566 --> 46:29.605
You've got once chance
to redeem yourself.

46:29.804 --> 46:31.659
He wants a photo of Veronica.

46:31.852 --> 46:34.601
-Who?
-Me. Rocketgirl.

46:34.794 --> 46:36.768
-ls nude an option?
-Miles.

46:37.163 --> 46:39.300
There was a temp
that used to work here.

46:39.497 --> 46:41.319
-Veronica something.
-"Veronica something."

46:41.512 --> 46:43.900
-You gotta be kidding me.
-She worked for Jesse Drake.

46:44.104 --> 46:46.242
Every employee here
has got a security photo lD.

46:46.439 --> 46:48.293
-She's got to be in the files.
-Oh, come on.

46:48.486 --> 46:49.598
Miles. Do it.

46:49.798 --> 46:52.993
I need this, Miles.
Just do it. Please.

46:56.068 --> 46:59.198
-Hurry up.
-A last name would really help.

46:59.394 --> 47:01.914
Yeah, well, how many Veronicas
can there be in the system?

47:03.522 --> 47:05.048
Come on, Miles.

47:05.249 --> 47:06.590
Hurry.

47:07.456 --> 47:11.033
-Miles.
-This is ridiculous. Come on.

47:11.231 --> 47:13.718
Come on. Come on.

47:13.918 --> 47:17.179
I can see him from here.
Come on, Miles, hurry.

47:17.372 --> 47:18.681
Miles.

47:18.876 --> 47:20.818
Hurry up. Miles.

47:21.787 --> 47:24.885
-Okay.
-Hurry.

47:25.082 --> 47:27.220
Come on, come on.

47:29.017 --> 47:30.064
Yahtzee.

47:30.680 --> 47:34.028
Veronica Carter. Just download,
upload, exhale and send.

47:34.231 --> 47:36.140
You are awesome.

47:36.342 --> 47:38.731
Yeah, well, remember that
the next time you're firing me.

47:39.638 --> 47:40.717
Oh, Ro...

47:40.916 --> 47:43.371
...I'm meeting my guy
from the M.E.'s office, Bill Patel...

47:43.572 --> 47:44.619
...at Chumley's at 7:00.

47:44.819 --> 47:47.088
He's got the talks on Grace,
everything the cops have.

47:47.282 --> 47:49.551
Great. I'll meet you there.

47:52.561 --> 47:53.738
-Shit.
-What?

47:53.937 --> 47:56.718
My computer screen is frozen.
And Veronica's face is screen saver.

47:56.912 --> 47:58.286
What?

47:58.479 --> 47:59.788
-Miles.
-Turn it off.

47:59.983 --> 48:01.444
-Oh, fuck.
-Turn it off.

48:01.646 --> 48:03.172
Turn the power off.

48:04.205 --> 48:05.611
Fuck, he's coming.

48:06.572 --> 48:08.710
-Hi.
-Hi.

48:09.355 --> 48:11.329
-Pretty busy for the end of the day.
-Yeah.

48:11.530 --> 48:12.479
Just working away.

48:12.682 --> 48:14.307
Anything I can help with?

48:15.337 --> 48:16.613
Nope.

48:17.225 --> 48:19.613
Not unless data entry turns you on.

48:20.136 --> 48:23.135
You know what?
Surprisingly, it doesn't.

48:23.335 --> 48:24.796
But seriously, how you doing?

48:26.021 --> 48:27.963
Let me tell you about my night.

48:29.541 --> 48:33.402
I have to go to dinner at Sapa.
Average jokes, exceptional food.

48:34.115 --> 48:37.114
If you find yourself bored...

48:37.314 --> 48:42.015
...in the area of 24th and Sixth
around 1 0:00...

48:42.208 --> 48:44.761
...you could fall by for a drink.

48:45.919 --> 48:50.041
I really appreciate that offer,
but I think I'm gonna have to pass.

48:50.238 --> 48:51.863
Okay.

48:56.764 --> 48:58.868
Is there something else I can do
for you, or--?

49:00.587 --> 49:01.896
No.

49:02.442 --> 49:04.384
I'm just waiting for you to change
your mind.

49:07.145 --> 49:08.835
Look, Mr. Hill--

49:09.032 --> 49:12.479
I recognize that tone.
Sounds serious.

49:13.863 --> 49:15.356
I really like working here.

49:15.558 --> 49:19.812
And I would really like for my work
to speak for itself.

49:20.996 --> 49:22.457
Fair enough.

49:24.131 --> 49:26.335
Have a splendid evening,
Miss Pogue.

49:30.210 --> 49:32.413
Wait. Mr. Hill?

49:34.688 --> 49:37.273
In case I change my mind...

49:38.847 --> 49:41.301
...keep an eye out around dessert.

49:44.445 --> 49:46.615
Hey, how you guys doing?

49:46.812 --> 49:50.106
-Miles.
-Bill Patel, Rowena Price.

49:50.299 --> 49:52.022
-A pleasure.
-You can lose the glasses.

49:52.218 --> 49:54.072
This isn't Deep Throat.

49:54.745 --> 49:56.784
Here's your piña colada,
hold the umbrella.

49:58.424 --> 50:01.205
We know about the drowning, Bill,
but what was this poison?

50:01.399 --> 50:02.609
Belladonna.

50:02.806 --> 50:04.213
What's that?

50:04.406 --> 50:07.220
Highly toxic plant that's used
to make atropine.

50:07.413 --> 50:08.623
You know what that is, right?

50:08.820 --> 50:11.438
Well, yeah.
Atropine is used to dilate eyes.

50:11.635 --> 50:14.536
And for anesthesia, and in cardiac
medicine as a resuscitant...

50:14.738 --> 50:17.454
...and witchcraft.

50:19.185 --> 50:21.606
Coroner had cause of death listed
as atropine poisoning...

50:21.808 --> 50:25.701
...but I did a further test on the bile
and found it was belladonna.

50:25.903 --> 50:27.015
Which means what?

50:27.214 --> 50:30.377
It's not the expensive synthetic type,
so it's more readily available...

50:30.574 --> 50:32.907
...harder to narrow down
where it came from.

50:33.101 --> 50:34.344
Where do you get it?

50:35.212 --> 50:39.782
Well, you don't pop into Duane Reade
and order a vial, but it's accessible.

50:39.978 --> 50:41.919
Easy enough to find
if you know where to look.

50:42.121 --> 50:44.324
Nowadays, you can pretty much get
anything online.

50:44.520 --> 50:46.178
But it's definitely toxic?

50:46.376 --> 50:50.019
Belladonna is used for eye surgeries,
but never in this amount.

50:50.215 --> 50:52.156
The killer put it in her eyes.

50:52.358 --> 50:57.658
Her death was brutal
and certainly no accident.

50:57.988 --> 50:59.035
Cheers.

51:01.667 --> 51:03.073
-Where you going?
-I gotta run.

51:03.266 --> 51:04.989
-Well, stick around for a while.
-I can't.

51:05.185 --> 51:09.046
I gotta run home. Going out for a drink.
Bill here can tell you more about it.

51:10.400 --> 51:12.309
Bill? You okay?

51:12.991 --> 51:14.071
Brain freeze.

51:14.270 --> 51:17.400
-Who are you getting drinks with?
-I will call you later.

51:17.598 --> 51:19.834
Bill, you have been a godsend.
Thank you.

51:20.700 --> 51:21.910
Breathe through the nose.

51:53.073 --> 51:54.185
Nice dress.

51:54.385 --> 51:56.489
-Nice party.
-Tell you what.

51:57.104 --> 51:59.176
Order two Hemingway daiquiris.

51:59.375 --> 52:01.829
This joint is one of two places
in all of New York City...

52:02.031 --> 52:04.451
...that makes great daiquiris.
I'll be back to tell you...

52:04.654 --> 52:06.693
...why they taste like heaven.

52:07.404 --> 52:09.542
Did I tell you that's a great-looking
dress?

52:18.345 --> 52:20.167
No, no, no.

52:21.545 --> 52:24.064
-You ready?
-Two daiquiris.

52:41.313 --> 52:42.622
Thank you.

52:43.041 --> 52:45.495
I'm dizzy from the spin
and I'm all the way over here.

52:48.095 --> 52:49.339
Here.

52:50.271 --> 52:54.808
A very famous man once said
that sincerity is everything.

52:55.005 --> 52:57.851
Once you learn to fake that,
the rest is easy.

52:58.396 --> 53:01.711
So the Hemingway daiquiri...

53:01.947 --> 53:04.696
...is two ounces of light rum,
one ounce--

53:04.889 --> 53:07.344
One ounce lime juice,
one ounce simple syrup...

53:07.545 --> 53:10.195
...dash grapefruit grenadine float.

53:10.391 --> 53:13.325
Oh, I knew I had to worry about you.
You pay attention.

53:13.526 --> 53:17.748
I do. For instance,
I noticed that wedding ring.

53:17.941 --> 53:20.722
Oh, yes. I am married.

53:20.916 --> 53:23.370
-So what?
-So, what are you doing here with me?

53:23.571 --> 53:25.294
I'm having a Hemingway daiquiri
with you.

53:25.490 --> 53:27.945
-What are you doing here with me?
-Am I with you?

53:29.522 --> 53:30.666
Are you married?

53:30.865 --> 53:33.581
Wow, that would make this
really interesting, wouldn't it?

53:33.775 --> 53:35.117
-No. God, no.
-No?

53:35.311 --> 53:37.253
-Just broke up with someone?
-No.

53:37.455 --> 53:38.861
-Gay?
-No.

53:39.054 --> 53:41.671
Actually, I'm thinking of joining
Match.com.

53:41.869 --> 53:43.908
-No, you're not. Are you kidding me?
-Yes.

53:44.109 --> 53:45.701
-People date online.
-You're gorgeous.

53:45.899 --> 53:47.557
What do you think of it?

53:47.756 --> 53:49.697
My life is complicated enough
as it is.

53:49.898 --> 53:51.043
I'm having a drink with you.

53:51.242 --> 53:53.663
I'm trying to figure out
how I'm gonna explain that.

53:53.865 --> 53:55.588
Will you have to?

53:56.808 --> 53:58.465
Hopefully not.

53:59.368 --> 54:01.058
Hopefully not.

54:01.254 --> 54:03.294
-Do you have kids?
-No.

54:03.494 --> 54:04.835
You don't have any kids, right?

54:05.030 --> 54:06.785
-No.
-Family?

54:06.981 --> 54:08.638
A mother.

54:09.988 --> 54:14.493
Here is to Gunnar Hope
and his corner office.

54:14.690 --> 54:16.599
Oh, God.

54:17.953 --> 54:20.822
-That was a little dramatic, wasn't it?
-Yeah.

54:21.024 --> 54:23.990
I refuse to be treated like that.
That fucking Phelps.

54:24.191 --> 54:25.467
Rat.

54:25.662 --> 54:26.840
Committed the cardinal sin.

54:27.038 --> 54:30.615
-Which is what?
-Don't betray your friends.

54:30.813 --> 54:32.241
Don't betray people who love you.

54:32.444 --> 54:33.393
Law of the jungle, huh?

54:33.596 --> 54:35.570
Law of the universe.

54:35.771 --> 54:38.487
It's not kill or be killed anymore.

54:38.682 --> 54:42.325
Kill or become irrelevant.

54:43.961 --> 54:46.742
So here's to not becoming
irrelevant.

54:47.991 --> 54:49.397
And don't be mad.

54:49.590 --> 54:51.761
Don't be mad that I'm married
or any of that.

54:51.958 --> 54:56.779
I mean, because that's, you know,
a different thing than what this is.

54:56.980 --> 54:58.386
Is it?

55:01.874 --> 55:04.262
I should probably just make some
arrangements...

55:04.466 --> 55:06.440
...to have a car take you home.

55:06.641 --> 55:08.069
Okay.

55:08.273 --> 55:09.647
Okay.

55:11.088 --> 55:13.508
Drink your Hemingway daiquiri.

55:19.916 --> 55:22.403
-Hello.
-Where the hell have you been, kiddo?

55:22.604 --> 55:25.952
-Late night.
-Yeah, I'll bet.

55:26.155 --> 55:27.780
Hey, wait a minute. Are you drunk?

55:28.426 --> 55:31.011
No. Sounds like you are.

55:31.208 --> 55:33.542
-No, I'm not.
-What's up?

55:33.735 --> 55:37.312
-Oh, just me waiting to talk to you.
-About?

55:38.534 --> 55:41.915
I kind of thought that we were doing
this story together.

55:42.117 --> 55:43.230
We are.

55:43.429 --> 55:46.395
I'm the one who's doing all the grunt
work while you're out drinking.

55:46.596 --> 55:49.083
You know, I mean, at least,
you can introduce me to the--

55:49.283 --> 55:51.192
At least, you can introduce me
to the lesbian.

55:51.394 --> 55:52.735
Take the virtual tour.

55:52.929 --> 55:55.383
I'm sure there's a lovely picture
of her there, Miles.

55:55.585 --> 55:57.689
-Night, night.
-Wait, wait, wait.

55:58.560 --> 56:01.722
Remember that series of murders
they traced back to Riverbank Park?

56:01.918 --> 56:04.535
The drifter they never caught?

56:04.734 --> 56:07.831
Women that were being murdered
and tossed off the cliffs?

56:08.029 --> 56:09.817
Yeah, yeah. The Rufus Scott series.

56:10.011 --> 56:14.004
Yeah, well, the cops think
maybe the drifter tossed Grace.

56:14.362 --> 56:16.882
Yeah, well, maybe.

56:17.081 --> 56:21.455
But I'm gonna go to bed,
so let's talk about it tomorrow.

56:21.656 --> 56:23.760
-Sweet dreams.
-Bye.

56:30.389 --> 56:31.501
Tired?

56:37.043 --> 56:40.783
What did you have in mind?

56:41.233 --> 56:42.280
you.

56:43.248 --> 56:45.833
The coffee room. Remember?

56:46.032 --> 56:49.805
-you rubbed against me.
-This is some good shit.

56:49.999 --> 56:52.332
Save this chat.

56:52.526 --> 56:54.151
Then you bent over.

56:54.348 --> 56:55.330
She did?

56:55.532 --> 56:57.474
you knew what you were doing
to me.

56:57.676 --> 56:59.301
you liked it.

57:00.011 --> 57:01.537
Not quite.

57:01.738 --> 57:03.265
I can't stop thinking about you.

57:04.234 --> 57:06.306
Where's your boyfriend?

57:06.505 --> 57:08.741
You are a twisted--

57:08.936 --> 57:10.845
Where's your wife?

57:11.335 --> 57:13.571
-Out.
-Out. Figured.

57:14.278 --> 57:16.896
Looks like it's just you and me, Hill.

57:17.093 --> 57:18.849
Are you turned on?

57:19.045 --> 57:20.800
No.

57:21.348 --> 57:22.776
Me too.

57:24.227 --> 57:26.593
Are you trying to seduce me,
mister?

57:26.786 --> 57:29.240
Wait a minute, now I'm gonna
get your whole name...

57:29.441 --> 57:32.572
...Harrison Hill.

57:32.768 --> 57:35.004
-What are you wearing?
-Robe.

57:35.199 --> 57:38.013
-What's underneath?
-Panties.

57:38.206 --> 57:41.140
Ask what color. Come on, come on.
I know it. What color?

57:41.341 --> 57:42.966
What color?

57:45.116 --> 57:46.904
I knew it.

57:47.099 --> 57:49.749
White. Sheer.

57:49.947 --> 57:52.466
-I like that.
-You like that?

57:52.665 --> 57:54.607
Now picture this.

57:55.224 --> 57:57.460
-We're on a beach.
-No, no. Let's keep this real.

57:57.656 --> 58:01.844
-Let's put this at H2A.
-Okay.

58:02.038 --> 58:04.077
-H2A.
-Yes.

58:04.821 --> 58:07.187
-No one's around.
-I got to tell you about this, Miles.

58:07.381 --> 58:09.235
you come into the coffee room.

58:11.187 --> 58:12.910
I'm already there.

58:14.258 --> 58:18.086
Miles, chatting with Hill...

58:18.289 --> 58:23.655
-...talking about H2A.
-you rub against me.

58:25.103 --> 58:27.142
I lift up your skirt.

58:27.918 --> 58:28.965
Veronica?

58:29.517 --> 58:30.858
-Veronica.
-I'm coming.

58:31.053 --> 58:34.597
-you there?
-Sorry. My hands were a little busy.

58:34.795 --> 58:38.242
Mine too. At least one of them.

58:41.705 --> 58:42.981
God, you're easy.

58:43.593 --> 58:45.316
I'm gonna tell you what to do.

58:45.512 --> 58:47.072
you like being told what to do?

58:47.559 --> 58:49.249
Okay.

58:49.447 --> 58:52.163
Trail your hands to your panties.

58:53.477 --> 58:55.364
Go inside.

58:56.452 --> 58:59.320
Can you feel me fucking you, Ro?

59:13.310 --> 59:15.132
-Hey.
-Hi.

59:15.614 --> 59:18.330
-What are you doing here?
-Giving you breakfast.

59:18.525 --> 59:20.945
-Good morning.
-Yeah? Morning.

59:24.699 --> 59:26.487
Don't answer it.

59:26.682 --> 59:28.024
-I have to answer it.
-You don't.

59:28.217 --> 59:29.591
-Wait, hold that thought.
-No, no.

59:29.785 --> 59:31.672
Don't. Tell them that you're busy.

59:31.864 --> 59:33.271
-Don't answer that.
-Hey.

59:33.463 --> 59:36.561
Hey, I need to talk to you.
I think I got a breakthrough on Hill.

59:36.759 --> 59:38.645
Please give me a second.
I gotta take this.

59:38.838 --> 59:41.936
Okay, Miles, what's up?
Did you get my e-mail?

59:42.133 --> 59:44.685
Wait, tell me you didn't just say,
"Cam, give me a minute."

59:44.884 --> 59:46.258
I don't have time for this shit.

59:46.451 --> 59:49.265
-What?
-Oh, you're busy, huh?

59:50.674 --> 59:52.779
Well, look, there's too much
to go over right now.

59:52.977 --> 59:54.733
Can you meet me
at the Grill Room at 1:00?

59:54.928 --> 59:56.716
-Yeah.
-I hate that he's there, Ro.

59:56.912 --> 59:59.333
Yeah, I know you do.

01:00:00.015 --> 01:00:01.989
Hey, Ro.

01:00:03.118 --> 01:00:04.295
Did Cam happen to mention...

01:00:04.493 --> 01:00:07.340
...that he's having a DNA test today
for Grace's baby?

01:00:07.852 --> 01:00:09.858
Three o'clock, 31st Precinct.

01:00:10.539 --> 01:00:12.294
Cops have them together
in November.

01:00:12.491 --> 01:00:13.418
Coffee.

01:00:14.059 --> 01:00:16.130
Did he happen to mention that?

01:00:17.705 --> 01:00:19.875
What is it with great women
and shitty men?

01:00:20.072 --> 01:00:21.216
I don't know.

01:00:21.416 --> 01:00:23.836
You figure it out. Tell me later.

01:00:25.894 --> 01:00:27.203
No more phones.

01:00:34.435 --> 01:00:36.093
What are you doing later?

01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:38.046
-You.
-No, I mean, like later.

01:00:38.242 --> 01:00:40.151
This afternoon later.

01:00:40.737 --> 01:00:43.256
Showing a couple of places uptown.

01:00:44.096 --> 01:00:45.023
Oh, really?

01:00:45.216 --> 01:00:47.157
-What about downtown?
-What do you mean?

01:00:47.359 --> 01:00:50.456
-Thirty-first Precinct.
-What?

01:00:50.654 --> 01:00:52.508
Three o'clock.

01:00:53.309 --> 01:00:57.049
Fucking liar. Thought you said you
hadn't seen Grace in over a year.

01:00:57.244 --> 01:00:58.171
I haven't.

01:00:58.363 --> 01:01:01.177
That must be why the cops
have you with her three months ago.

01:01:01.978 --> 01:01:03.571
-Thanks.
-Thought you said it was over.

01:01:03.769 --> 01:01:05.841
You said you didn't give a shit
about that bitch.

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.341
-I don't.
-You sat your ass right there and said:

01:01:08.536 --> 01:01:10.477
-"l love you, Ro."
-I do, Ro.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:11.824
You're a fucking liar.

01:01:15.350 --> 01:01:17.324
Was it yours?

01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:23.467
Could it have been yours?

01:01:28.817 --> 01:01:30.245
I don't know.

01:01:32.368 --> 01:01:36.196
-You don't know.
-Ro--

01:01:36.687 --> 01:01:38.541
Get the hell out of my house.

01:02:11.235 --> 01:02:12.696
-Good morning, Larry.
-Good morning.

01:02:15.809 --> 01:02:17.053
Hey.

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.160
Good morning.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:20.767
Morning.

01:02:23.295 --> 01:02:24.636
Okay.

01:02:25.023 --> 01:02:26.931
I give up. What?

01:02:27.134 --> 01:02:28.857
You didn't read the paper today?

01:02:29.053 --> 01:02:31.899
Today is "National Take Your Best
Employee to Work Day."

01:02:33.275 --> 01:02:35.413
So I guess you're going to pick up
Esmeralda next.

01:02:35.611 --> 01:02:38.610
You know what? Esmeralda rides
a broom to work every day.

01:02:42.008 --> 01:02:44.658
That's funny. Very funny.
A sense of humor.

01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:49.971
Bobby, say hi to Katherine.

01:02:50.518 --> 01:02:53.484
Hi, Esmeralda, it's me again.
Is he still in a meeting?

01:02:54.101 --> 01:02:57.002
Well, just let him know I called
and I'll see him later.

01:02:57.204 --> 01:02:58.316
Thanks.

01:03:06.897 --> 01:03:08.423
Thank you.

01:03:14.318 --> 01:03:19.401
Gentlemen, welcome to New York,
or as we like to call it, Reebok Town.

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:24.070
Come and have a seat
right over here.

01:03:27.369 --> 01:03:31.775
That ass kissing will go on all
afternoon. Wanna take a long lunch?

01:03:32.263 --> 01:03:36.768
No, actually, I can't.
I've got to meet a friend downtown.

01:03:36.966 --> 01:03:38.394
I'll see you.

01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:40.956
Fancy lady.

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:44.129
-So, what's up?
-I stumbled across some information...

01:03:44.324 --> 01:03:46.266
...about Hill's wife
and her family fortune.

01:03:46.467 --> 01:03:49.313
They had millions and millions.
And they invested a lot of it...

01:03:49.506 --> 01:03:51.840
...into medical research.
One of the guys they backed...

01:03:52.033 --> 01:03:54.782
...revolutionized surgery
by finding a medicinal use...

01:03:54.976 --> 01:03:57.693
...for a poisonous plant
called belladonna.

01:03:57.887 --> 01:04:01.399
We have proof that Hill was ADEX.
We have proof that ADEX knew Grace.

01:04:01.598 --> 01:04:03.092
We have the motive,
the pregnancy...

01:04:03.293 --> 01:04:07.994
...now we have knowledge and history
that links Hill directly with belladonna.

01:04:08.283 --> 01:04:11.349
The only thing we don't have is access
to Hill's personal e-mail account.

01:04:11.547 --> 01:04:13.434
What are you talking about?
We do have access.

01:04:13.626 --> 01:04:15.830
That's his lOL account.
His main account is with H2A.

01:04:16.025 --> 01:04:18.577
I can't get to it. There's a firewall.
There's something new.

01:04:18.777 --> 01:04:20.947
I can't scale it with a remote.

01:04:21.783 --> 01:04:24.084
-Take this.
-And what's that?

01:04:24.279 --> 01:04:26.547
It's new spyware you'll mickey
into Hill's laptop.

01:04:26.742 --> 01:04:29.130
Go at the end of the day,
install it into the computer...

01:04:29.333 --> 01:04:30.794
...and bury it into the hard drive.

01:04:30.997 --> 01:04:34.574
-And how long will that take?
-Three minutes and 1 4 seconds.

01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:37.192
But that's just a guess.

01:05:10.887 --> 01:05:12.381
SPYrid?

01:05:12.582 --> 01:05:14.556
Fuck. What?

01:05:18.788 --> 01:05:20.675
-yeah?
-Okay. So he's got antispyware...

01:05:20.867 --> 01:05:22.874
...on his computer.
There's a big sign that says:

01:05:23.075 --> 01:05:25.114
"Stop in the name of SPYrid."

01:05:25.314 --> 01:05:27.735
SPYrid? Oh, he's definitely
hiding something.

01:05:27.937 --> 01:05:30.205
There was a leak, so they probably
went into lockdown.

01:05:30.401 --> 01:05:32.156
What do I do?
He's asking for a password.

01:05:33.247 --> 01:05:35.734
It's new. Look, I can get in,
but it'll take a few minutes.

01:05:35.935 --> 01:05:38.651
Just take the flash drive out,
we'll do it later. I'm sorry.

01:05:38.845 --> 01:05:40.438
Sorry? All you can say is sorry?

01:05:40.637 --> 01:05:43.157
-Well, I don't--
-Well, tell me something.

01:05:49.562 --> 01:05:51.219
Usually the competition's smarter...

01:05:51.417 --> 01:05:54.798
...than to send a beautiful temp
into the boss's office...

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.860
...to snoop around on his fucking
computer to try and find fresh ideas.

01:05:59.063 --> 01:06:01.004
-l, well, l--
-No, wait.

01:06:01.206 --> 01:06:04.783
Let me see if I can help you.
I am in your office...

01:06:05.556 --> 01:06:09.548
...and I really need to come up
with a really honest story.

01:06:10.803 --> 01:06:15.471
No. I was really just gonna--
I don't know, tell you the truth.

01:06:15.665 --> 01:06:17.225
Go ahead. Give that a shot.

01:06:17.425 --> 01:06:21.646
I came in here
because I wanted to leave you a note.

01:06:22.127 --> 01:06:24.940
I wanted to do it at the end of the day
when there was nobody here.

01:06:25.134 --> 01:06:28.516
I really didn't want everybody
in this office to know...

01:06:28.717 --> 01:06:30.658
...that the new girl...

01:06:30.924 --> 01:06:35.046
...has got a big crush on the boss.

01:06:35.978 --> 01:06:38.247
And what was this little note
gonna say?

01:06:38.793 --> 01:06:41.181
Well, it was gonna say
that you're wrong...

01:06:41.928 --> 01:06:44.000
...because there's 1 7 restaurants
in this city...

01:06:44.199 --> 01:06:47.460
...that make the
Hemingway daiquiri.

01:06:49.062 --> 01:06:51.134
Who were you talking to
on the phone?

01:06:51.333 --> 01:06:52.642
-Eddie.
-Eddie?

01:06:52.836 --> 01:06:53.948
My friend Eddie.

01:06:54.148 --> 01:06:56.569
He's a bartender
and he was helping me...

01:06:57.283 --> 01:06:58.330
...put together the list.

01:06:58.531 --> 01:07:00.538
I realize that I didn't remember
all 1 7 bars...

01:07:00.738 --> 01:07:04.217
...so I was calling him for help
and l--

01:07:04.833 --> 01:07:06.654
I'm sorry.

01:07:07.296 --> 01:07:10.229
-And I'm positive I'm fired.
-Get out.

01:07:15.293 --> 01:07:17.300
Here. This is the list of the bars.

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:20.533
-Please get--
-I'm telling you the truth.

01:07:20.731 --> 01:07:22.389
This...

01:07:22.586 --> 01:07:23.928
...is what I was leaving.

01:07:26.393 --> 01:07:28.182
You might wanna...

01:07:28.377 --> 01:07:29.970
...check them out.

01:07:36.246 --> 01:07:38.733
Hey. This is what you want me
to believe?

01:07:38.934 --> 01:07:40.689
That you came in here...

01:07:41.045 --> 01:07:42.506
...for this list?

01:07:43.796 --> 01:07:45.203
Yeah.

01:07:46.643 --> 01:07:48.071
Okay.

01:07:49.010 --> 01:07:50.831
Well, you're fired.

01:07:54.864 --> 01:07:56.838
Because I don't wanna take you
to dinner...

01:07:57.039 --> 01:07:58.926
...as your boss.

01:08:00.046 --> 01:08:05.347
I mean, maybe I'll rehire you
in the morning or maybe after dessert.

01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:08.896
You can tell me all about this crush
you have on the boss.

01:08:12.618 --> 01:08:13.828
Okay.

01:08:36.098 --> 01:08:39.228
-I did that?
-Yes, you did that.

01:08:48.413 --> 01:08:49.875
-Where you going?
-Wait.

01:08:51.453 --> 01:08:53.557
I've gotta go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

01:08:53.756 --> 01:08:54.868
All right.

01:08:56.955 --> 01:08:58.448
-I'll be right back.
-You all right?

01:10:37.018 --> 01:10:39.406
All of a sudden I'm not feeling
that good.

01:10:39.609 --> 01:10:41.878
I think maybe you should
take me home.

01:10:44.791 --> 01:10:47.092
Too much sake, I think.

01:11:09.039 --> 01:11:11.526
Which way are we going?
My exit's back there.

01:11:40.804 --> 01:11:43.138
How far are you prepared
to take this?

01:11:46.211 --> 01:11:48.152
Say your name.

01:11:49.314 --> 01:11:50.720
Go ahead. Just say it.

01:11:52.129 --> 01:11:54.943
-Katherine.
-Bullshit.

01:11:55.135 --> 01:11:57.590
-Katherine Pogue.
-Bullshit.

01:12:03.485 --> 01:12:04.913
Bullshit.

01:12:08.764 --> 01:12:12.024
Okay. You need to take me home.

01:12:13.113 --> 01:12:14.574
Esmeralda was right.

01:12:18.328 --> 01:12:20.399
And I didn't want to believe her.

01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:26.706
You're a spy for Kirschenbaum,
right?

01:12:28.053 --> 01:12:29.645
Answer me!

01:12:31.155 --> 01:12:32.715
Don't wanna talk?

01:12:33.939 --> 01:12:35.760
Well, I'll tell you what.

01:12:36.434 --> 01:12:38.092
How about this?

01:12:39.345 --> 01:12:44.199
Let's get your pal M on the phone.

01:12:44.399 --> 01:12:48.075
Who the fuck is M?
And why is my name on this text?

01:12:53.644 --> 01:12:54.953
Okay.

01:12:56.011 --> 01:12:58.312
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

01:12:58.507 --> 01:13:00.840
-Are you or are you not a fucking spy?
-Yes.

01:13:01.034 --> 01:13:02.692
-What?
-Yes.

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:07.654
Phelps, right?

01:13:08.999 --> 01:13:10.908
You and that scumbag Phelps
the whole time.

01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:13.662
From the first day. Right?

01:13:14.757 --> 01:13:16.928
How much could they be
paying you?

01:13:17.124 --> 01:13:19.774
Are they paying you more
than hooker money?

01:13:20.099 --> 01:13:22.040
Because that's what you are, right?

01:13:22.915 --> 01:13:25.085
Do you even know what the word
loyalty means?

01:13:25.282 --> 01:13:27.256
I bet your wife is wondering
the same thing.

01:13:40.285 --> 01:13:43.579
I am so disappointed in you
right now.

01:13:44.636 --> 01:13:46.773
But just because you wanna hurt
somebody...

01:13:48.282 --> 01:13:49.939
...doesn't mean that you will.

01:14:23.246 --> 01:14:26.027
Harrison. I'm sorry. I have--

01:14:26.221 --> 01:14:28.806
I've never spied on anybody
like this.

01:14:31.435 --> 01:14:33.028
Fuck you.

01:14:35.466 --> 01:14:36.894
Get out.

01:14:59.235 --> 01:15:00.641
Rowena.

01:15:04.704 --> 01:15:07.899
Rowena.

01:15:09.663 --> 01:15:11.931
Rowena.

01:15:17.212 --> 01:15:18.935
Come on, honey.

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:23.792
I wonder where could she be?

01:15:30.936 --> 01:15:32.528
Bath time.

01:15:33.367 --> 01:15:35.984
No.

01:15:37.429 --> 01:15:39.370
Ro, I called you
50 fucking times last night.

01:15:39.573 --> 01:15:41.939
I called you at H2A,
they said you no longer work there.

01:15:42.132 --> 01:15:43.658
I mean, what the fuck?
Where are you?

01:15:43.859 --> 01:15:46.160
On the way to the rehab center
to see my mother.

01:15:46.355 --> 01:15:49.550
Last time I spoke to you was when you
jimmied the lock on Hill's computer.

01:15:49.746 --> 01:15:51.752
Any idea of the thoughts
going through my head?

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.436
Hill saw the text message
you sent me last night.

01:15:55.631 --> 01:15:57.485
-What?
-So I guess we won't be getting...

01:15:57.678 --> 01:15:59.368
-...into his computer after all.
-Oh, no.

01:15:59.566 --> 01:16:01.572
No, no, no.

01:16:02.957 --> 01:16:05.290
No, it's okay.
I'll figure something out.

01:16:05.484 --> 01:16:09.411
-Don't worry about it. Are you okay?
-Yeah. I'm good.

01:16:12.266 --> 01:16:14.654
Look, can we...

01:16:15.177 --> 01:16:16.518
...have an early dinner tonight?

01:16:16.713 --> 01:16:19.973
You can bring your laptop and we'll
start putting the story together?

01:16:20.167 --> 01:16:22.370
-Okay.
-Okay?

01:16:22.567 --> 01:16:26.940
Oh, good. You never say okay,
and that's good. I love okay.

01:16:27.332 --> 01:16:30.746
Oh, good.
I'm just glad you're out of there.

01:16:30.948 --> 01:16:33.281
Yeah. Me too.

01:16:35.234 --> 01:16:37.306
Okay, I'll see you tonight.

01:16:37.953 --> 01:16:40.473
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:16:45.759 --> 01:16:47.351
Phyllis?

01:16:48.062 --> 01:16:49.949
Anybody here?

01:16:51.228 --> 01:16:52.886
Hello?

01:16:56.923 --> 01:16:58.199
Hi, Mom.

01:17:07.927 --> 01:17:09.814
You look pretty.

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:12.718
-Hello, can I help you?
-Oh, yeah, hi.

01:17:12.918 --> 01:17:15.950
I'm from lT. I was sent to run the detox
on Mr. Hill's computer.

01:17:16.148 --> 01:17:20.108
Fascinating. Wanna know why?
Nobody called lT.

01:17:20.307 --> 01:17:22.379
Well, your computer did, sir.

01:17:23.058 --> 01:17:26.985
When any computer hooked up
to the grid goes down, it cries for help.

01:17:27.184 --> 01:17:29.769
-A cry for help. Have you tried these?
-No.

01:17:29.967 --> 01:17:31.592
-There's honey in the center.
-Thank--

01:17:31.791 --> 01:17:34.376
-I'm Harrison Hill.
-Benson comma Kurt.

01:17:34.574 --> 01:17:36.875
Interesting name.
Let me ask you something.

01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:38.443
Could this have anything to do...

01:17:38.637 --> 01:17:40.873
...with someone installing spyware
on my computer?

01:17:41.068 --> 01:17:42.628
It could have to do with anything...

01:17:42.828 --> 01:17:46.471
...but I won't know until I give
your computer a clean scrub.

01:17:46.666 --> 01:17:48.804
-I like a good, clean scrub.
-Yeah.

01:17:49.065 --> 01:17:51.585
I need about 1 0 minutes in my office,
but in the meantime...

01:17:51.784 --> 01:17:54.020
...Josie wouldn't mind
showing you around the office.

01:17:54.215 --> 01:17:55.262
Hello, Josie.

01:17:55.464 --> 01:17:57.765
Josie, meet Benson comma Kurt.

01:17:57.958 --> 01:18:00.991
Esmeralda, can I have those mockups
that Gunnar left someplace, please?

01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:02.814
Yes, yes, I know right where it is.

01:18:03.013 --> 01:18:05.794
-Follow me.
-Josie.

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.930
Come on, Miles.

01:18:20.127 --> 01:18:21.337
Shit.

01:18:25.597 --> 01:18:27.539
Beautiful space.

01:18:28.316 --> 01:18:30.138
Beautiful people.

01:18:31.739 --> 01:18:34.607
Beautiful pictures. Are those--?
Are those planets?

01:18:34.811 --> 01:18:37.559
No, eyes.

01:18:37.753 --> 01:18:41.646
Mrs. Hill did a whole series:
"lnside the Dilated Eye."

01:18:42.072 --> 01:18:44.144
We have a guest computer.

01:18:44.343 --> 01:18:47.212
Take the virtual tour.
It's very informative.

01:18:48.661 --> 01:18:51.377
I'll be in my office if you need me.

01:19:09.230 --> 01:19:12.578
Oh, thanks. I got locked out.

01:19:51.681 --> 01:19:53.535
Miles is sexy.

01:19:55.551 --> 01:19:57.144
Miles?

01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:06.608
Miles is sexy.

01:20:19.479 --> 01:20:21.267
Miles is sexy.

01:20:31.859 --> 01:20:33.647
Miles is sexy.

01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:53.547
Miles is sexy.

01:21:24.929 --> 01:21:26.422
Miles is sexy.

01:21:46.810 --> 01:21:48.598
Miles is sexy.

01:21:53.144 --> 01:21:55.925
"Welcome, Trublu"?

01:22:05.204 --> 01:22:06.283
Miles is sexy.

01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:18.508
Miles is sexy.

01:22:26.668 --> 01:22:28.642
Miles is sexy.

01:22:36.329 --> 01:22:38.238
Miles is sexy.

01:22:47.109 --> 01:22:48.963
Miles is sexy.

01:22:57.411 --> 01:22:59.352
Miles is sexy.

01:23:05.343 --> 01:23:07.415
-Miles is sexy.
-Can I help you?

01:23:07.614 --> 01:23:09.621
What the fuck, Miles?

01:23:09.822 --> 01:23:13.367
What are you doing in this room?
Well, I heard my voice...

01:23:14.045 --> 01:23:15.833
...coming from your computer.

01:23:16.028 --> 01:23:17.915
That's what I'm doing.

01:23:18.427 --> 01:23:21.044
-It's a joke. That's just a joke.
-Oh, it's a joke, huh?

01:23:21.243 --> 01:23:25.103
Well, are all these pictures
on this computer a joke?

01:23:25.305 --> 01:23:26.232
Miles is sexy.

01:23:26.425 --> 01:23:30.417
Are the pictures of me out there
on that goddamn dummy a joke?

01:23:31.991 --> 01:23:33.397
I'll tell you what's funny.

01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:36.272
What's funny is the fact that
you said you hadn't seen Grace...

01:23:36.469 --> 01:23:40.265
...but yet you got pictures of her
on your computer from October.

01:23:40.468 --> 01:23:45.136
Nude pictures, all fucking chained up
and strapped up and shit.

01:23:45.330 --> 01:23:47.915
Hey, can we go in the other room
and talk about this?

01:23:48.114 --> 01:23:50.960
Let's talk about him. Trublu.

01:23:51.153 --> 01:23:53.454
Maybe your pal Trublu
took all these pictures.

01:23:53.647 --> 01:23:56.068
Maybe Trublu took all these
fucking pictures in here.

01:23:56.270 --> 01:23:57.514
You freak.

01:23:57.710 --> 01:24:00.165
-Wait a minute.
-Go ahead, admit it.

01:24:00.589 --> 01:24:03.817
Fucking admit it right now.
You were ADEX.

01:24:16.296 --> 01:24:19.873
-Two or three times, yeah.
-Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:24:20.071 --> 01:24:23.419
You've been manipulating
this whole thing, haven't you?

01:24:23.622 --> 01:24:26.970
Lying to me. Fucking Grace.

01:24:27.172 --> 01:24:29.026
Who didn't?

01:24:31.907 --> 01:24:35.005
You were trying to set up
Harrison Hill, huh?

01:24:37.569 --> 01:24:40.121
Wait a minute. You think that
because of this...

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:42.141
...that I had something to do
with that?

01:24:42.335 --> 01:24:44.985
Why wouldn't l? You can't keep
changing your identity, Miles...

01:24:45.182 --> 01:24:46.970
...and expect people to trust you.

01:24:47.166 --> 01:24:49.020
Don't be such a fucking hypocrite,
Ro.

01:24:49.661 --> 01:24:51.765
-Fuck you.
-No. Fuck you.

01:24:52.188 --> 01:24:54.707
I've been working my ass off
on this for you the whole time.

01:24:54.907 --> 01:24:57.808
-Everybody has secrets, Ro.
-Right. Everybody's got secrets, huh?

01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:59.919
Until they get caught.

01:25:01.401 --> 01:25:05.012
Let's see.
Take a fucking look at something.

01:25:05.207 --> 01:25:09.483
You told me to take the virtual tour
of H2A.

01:25:09.686 --> 01:25:10.668
When you do...

01:25:10.869 --> 01:25:13.771
...when you click on the photographs
hanging in the reception area...

01:25:13.973 --> 01:25:15.882
...it links you to Mia Hill's webpage.

01:25:16.084 --> 01:25:18.352
She took photographs of dilated eyes,
Ro.

01:25:18.547 --> 01:25:20.750
They're eyes. Look.
"Mia Rheinhart Hill replicates...

01:25:20.947 --> 01:25:22.801
...a phenomenon fashionable
in the 1 920s...

01:25:22.993 --> 01:25:26.986
...the dilation of a woman's pupils
with the use of belladonna."

01:25:27.184 --> 01:25:30.412
This is it.
This puts the poison in his hands...

01:25:30.607 --> 01:25:33.224
...or it puts the poison
in his wife's hands.

01:25:33.422 --> 01:25:34.883
This is it.

01:25:36.077 --> 01:25:38.215
This is what we've been looking for.

01:25:41.899 --> 01:25:43.841
You need to get help.

01:25:45.770 --> 01:25:47.776
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:25:47.978 --> 01:25:49.832
This is the story.

01:25:50.632 --> 01:25:52.519
Can I go now?

01:26:18.559 --> 01:26:22.452
I have a history of powerful men
squashing stories...

01:26:22.654 --> 01:26:24.628
...and hiding facts...

01:26:24.829 --> 01:26:26.421
...so I wanted to get this together.

01:26:26.621 --> 01:26:29.369
Give it to you before Harrison Hill
had a chance to do just that.

01:26:37.753 --> 01:26:39.607
"Veronica. What's new?"

01:26:42.295 --> 01:26:44.683
"Boyfriend's out of town."

01:26:47.158 --> 01:26:49.840
"Which means?" You tell me.

01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:53.037
"Hotel Gansevoort."

01:26:54.963 --> 01:26:57.166
"I'll leave a key under your name. "

01:26:57.362 --> 01:27:01.322
"From room 1801,
the view is spectacular...

01:27:01.521 --> 01:27:03.277
...especially the sunrise."

01:27:12.717 --> 01:27:14.146
Are you Harrison Hill?

01:27:16.812 --> 01:27:18.153
Yeah.

01:27:19.691 --> 01:27:22.886
Mr. Hill, I'm gonna need you to put
your hands behind your back.

01:27:26.057 --> 01:27:28.925
You're under arrest for the murder
of Grace Clayton.

01:27:29.383 --> 01:27:32.514
-Who?
-"Fast Filly."

01:27:33.606 --> 01:27:36.866
You have the right to remain silent
and refuse to answer any questions.

01:27:37.061 --> 01:27:40.769
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

01:27:40.964 --> 01:27:43.963
you have the right to hire an attorney
before speaking to the police...

01:27:44.162 --> 01:27:46.943
..and have an attorney present during
questioning any time now...

01:27:47.137 --> 01:27:48.729
...or in the future.

01:27:48.993 --> 01:27:52.123
The State of New york will prove
beyond a reasonable doubt...

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:57.272
... that the defendant, Harrison
Matthew Hill, did intentionally...

01:27:57.470 --> 01:28:00.949
...and with premeditation commit
the heinous murder...

01:28:01.149 --> 01:28:02.872
...of Grace Alexandra Clayton.

01:28:03.644 --> 01:28:05.400
Are you aware of the hundreds
of e-mails...

01:28:05.595 --> 01:28:07.831
...between your husband
and other women?

01:28:08.378 --> 01:28:09.687
Now I am.

01:28:09.882 --> 01:28:11.986
Mrs. Hill, where do you keep
your belladonna?

01:28:12.186 --> 01:28:15.665
It's in my medicine cabinet
in my photography studio downtown.

01:28:15.864 --> 01:28:18.547
The state will present irrefutable
physical evidence...

01:28:18.743 --> 01:28:22.222
... that places the murder weapon,
poison called belladonna...

01:28:22.422 --> 01:28:26.893
...in the defendant's car
commingled with the victim's blood...

01:28:27.092 --> 01:28:29.131
...hair and bodily secretions.

01:28:29.331 --> 01:28:30.378
We got blood.

01:28:30.579 --> 01:28:34.058
And, finally, you will learn
about Grace Clayton...

01:28:34.258 --> 01:28:36.875
...a young woman
who believed the lies...

01:28:37.073 --> 01:28:39.625
...that this ad man was selling...

01:28:39.824 --> 01:28:42.092
...never realizing the price
that she would pay...

01:28:42.287 --> 01:28:44.523
...would be her own tragic death.

01:28:44.718 --> 01:28:46.441
Thank you for your time
and consideration.

01:28:46.637 --> 01:28:48.524
I look forward to your
verdict at the close.

01:28:48.717 --> 01:28:52.261
All over the city, really.
But most often at his hotel suite.

01:28:52.459 --> 01:28:53.833
He kept one at the Gansevoort.

01:28:54.027 --> 01:28:56.066
He liked to watch the sun rise
over the city.

01:28:56.267 --> 01:29:00.007
He just didn't want his wife to find out.
If she did, it was over.

01:29:00.201 --> 01:29:04.673
The hair, blood and secretions
all matched the victim, Grace Clayton.

01:29:04.871 --> 01:29:07.837
Additionally, we did find some trace
elements of belladonna extract.

01:29:08.039 --> 01:29:11.005
All significant financial holdings
are in the name of his wife...

01:29:11.205 --> 01:29:13.626
-...Mia Rheinhart Hill.
-lt was after midnight on the 5th.

01:29:13.828 --> 01:29:15.006
I just started my shift.

01:29:15.204 --> 01:29:18.051
This blond woman was freaking out,
wanting to see Mr. Hill.

01:29:18.275 --> 01:29:19.867
I buzzed him. There was no answer.

01:29:20.067 --> 01:29:22.400
She left an envelope,
but she wasn't happy.

01:29:22.594 --> 01:29:26.270
About an hour later, Mr. Hill came
down, he took the envelope and left.

01:29:26.464 --> 01:29:28.089
I didn't see him the rest of the night.

01:29:28.288 --> 01:29:29.629
I'm holding in my hand a copy...

01:29:29.823 --> 01:29:32.473
...of State's Exhibit Number Three
in evidence which reads:

01:29:32.702 --> 01:29:35.418
"Grace. Don't come by my house.

01:29:36.189 --> 01:29:39.319
Don't come by my office.
We are done.

01:29:39.516 --> 01:29:42.101
Leave me the fuck alone."

01:29:42.299 --> 01:29:44.753
Can you please tell the jury
where this came from?

01:29:44.954 --> 01:29:49.328
I retrieved it from Harrison's hard drive
after the police seized his computer.

01:29:52.503 --> 01:29:56.942
It starts with a quiet hum,
an empty screen inviting you.

01:29:57.366 --> 01:30:01.009
-Has the jury reached a verdict?
-Yes, we have, Your Honor.

01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:05.289
"Come inside, " it says.

01:30:06.259 --> 01:30:08.014
"We're always open. "

01:30:08.594 --> 01:30:11.049
Will the defendant please rise?

01:30:14.192 --> 01:30:16.810
How do you find on the charge
of murder in the first degree?

01:30:20.878 --> 01:30:24.674
It's a world, you think, where
actions have no consequence...

01:30:25.933 --> 01:30:28.266
...where guilt is cloaked
by anonymity...

01:30:29.803 --> 01:30:32.257
...where there are no fingerprints.

01:30:34.762 --> 01:30:37.150
An invisible universe...

01:30:40.328 --> 01:30:42.629
...filled with strangers...

01:30:43.207 --> 01:30:45.378
...interconnected online...

01:30:46.182 --> 01:30:48.003
...and disconnected in life.

01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:51.839
It will steal your secrets...

01:30:52.292 --> 01:30:53.884
...corrupt your dreams...

01:30:55.714 --> 01:30:58.496
...and co-opt your identity.

01:31:00.577 --> 01:31:02.333
Because in this world...

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:06.228
... where you can be anything
you want...

01:31:07.071 --> 01:31:09.012
...anyone you want...

01:31:11.134 --> 01:31:13.653
...you just might lose sight...

01:31:14.972 --> 01:31:16.695
...of who you are.

01:31:28.631 --> 01:31:30.518
Hello, Rowena.

01:31:31.414 --> 01:31:33.869
You know how much Daddy
likes bath time.

01:31:38.228 --> 01:31:42.056
My great big beautiful girl.

01:31:42.291 --> 01:31:43.305
You are so--

01:31:44.786 --> 01:31:47.916
-Put her down, now.
-She needed help.

01:31:48.113 --> 01:31:50.502
-lsn't that right, Rowena?
-Get out.

01:31:51.056 --> 01:31:52.582
Oh, you better get out of here.

01:31:52.783 --> 01:31:54.571
-You put that thing down.
-No, I mean it.

01:31:54.767 --> 01:31:56.871
Put it down, now.

01:31:57.294 --> 01:31:58.854
Do you hear me?

01:32:01.772 --> 01:32:04.259
Are you okay, honey?
Are you okay?

01:32:07.722 --> 01:32:08.649
Mommy, he's coming.

01:32:09.546 --> 01:32:12.992
I said, get out. Get out.

01:32:15.655 --> 01:32:17.826
She was blackmailing you,
wasn't she?

01:32:18.023 --> 01:32:20.291
That's why you did her those favors
all those years...

01:32:20.486 --> 01:32:22.973
...even after she slept
with your boyfriend.

01:32:24.453 --> 01:32:27.103
You just couldn't say no, could you?

01:32:29.027 --> 01:32:31.808
What was it?
What did Grace know about you?

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:40.894
We're just gonna tell people
he disappeared.

01:32:41.087 --> 01:32:43.127
Like last August.

01:32:43.582 --> 01:32:44.923
He just never came home.

01:32:45.150 --> 01:32:48.694
He just went away
and he never came home.

01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:51.194
You got that?

01:32:51.388 --> 01:32:53.395
Rowena, look at me.

01:32:53.595 --> 01:32:54.969
You got that?

01:33:00.313 --> 01:33:02.319
God, you must have hated her.

01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:05.486
I hated her. I hated her for you.

01:33:06.774 --> 01:33:07.756
I still do.

01:33:07.958 --> 01:33:08.886
-Rowena.
-Grace.

01:33:09.078 --> 01:33:12.111
-She just kept coming back.
-You can't just forget people.

01:33:12.309 --> 01:33:14.926
Bury them and pretend
like they never existed?

01:33:15.603 --> 01:33:18.221
And then she handed you Hill
that night.

01:33:18.675 --> 01:33:20.235
She fucking handed him to you.

01:33:20.434 --> 01:33:21.481
Regards to your mother.

01:33:23.697 --> 01:33:28.267
At some point, you must have thought,
"This has to end.

01:33:28.559 --> 01:33:29.835
This all has to end."

01:33:31.278 --> 01:33:34.823
So you did a little research.
you took the virtual tour.

01:33:35.021 --> 01:33:37.671
That's how you found out about
the belladonna.

01:33:37.869 --> 01:33:39.875
That's how you knew you could pin it
on Hill.

01:33:41.515 --> 01:33:43.969
And then that's how
I knew it was you.

01:33:44.586 --> 01:33:46.790
You remember that night
at my apartment?

01:33:46.985 --> 01:33:48.872
When I was looking for Mia Hill's
webpage...

01:33:49.065 --> 01:33:51.649
...and your computer finished
the address for me.

01:33:51.848 --> 01:33:53.440
Didn't register for me at the time.

01:33:53.639 --> 01:33:57.085
It occurred to me that you already
had everything you needed to know.

01:33:57.286 --> 01:34:00.896
- you led me right to him.
-Belladonna is used to dilate eyes.

01:34:01.093 --> 01:34:04.190
-Are those planets?
-No, eyes.

01:34:04.388 --> 01:34:07.289
Mrs. Hill did a whole series:
"lnside the Dilated Eye."

01:34:07.490 --> 01:34:09.148
Every step of the fucking way.

01:34:09.345 --> 01:34:12.988
And then, all you needed
was the belladonna.

01:34:13.856 --> 01:34:16.092
And l--
And I remembered your mother...

01:34:16.287 --> 01:34:20.955
...and that pathetic little pharmacy
they have there...

01:34:22.173 --> 01:34:25.074
...and how you always used to
complain how understaffed they were.

01:34:25.276 --> 01:34:27.283
And it really wasn't that difficult
to get.

01:34:27.708 --> 01:34:31.219
you called her to let her think
you were gonna do a story on Hill.

01:34:31.418 --> 01:34:34.548
"Bring your computer, " you said,
"show me everything you've got. "

01:34:34.745 --> 01:34:38.289
you laced her drink good enough
to knock her out. you got some hair.

01:34:38.488 --> 01:34:39.665
you took some blood.

01:34:39.863 --> 01:34:41.805
you placed the belladonna
in her eyes...

01:34:42.007 --> 01:34:44.395
...to implicate Hill or his wife.

01:34:46.645 --> 01:34:48.106
And then...

01:34:48.629 --> 01:34:53.646
...all you needed to do was connect
Hill with the physical evidence.

01:34:53.842 --> 01:34:56.591
you had the blood.
you had the fibers.

01:34:58.001 --> 01:35:00.204
you even had the belladonna.

01:35:01.232 --> 01:35:04.101
All the tumblers clicking into place.

01:35:06.095 --> 01:35:08.167
Secrets are great, Ro.

01:35:08.366 --> 01:35:10.438
Unless you get caught.

01:35:12.588 --> 01:35:15.718
You once told me that all it takes
for the perfect murder...

01:35:15.915 --> 01:35:19.143
...are the right ingredients
at the right time.

01:35:23.688 --> 01:35:26.949
So you waited all these years
for everything to line up.

01:35:33.253 --> 01:35:35.642
That's fucking beautiful.

01:35:36.676 --> 01:35:38.563
That's poetic.

01:35:43.554 --> 01:35:47.033
It's almost perfect
except for one little thing.

01:35:54.495 --> 01:35:59.479
What are you willing to do for me
to keep me quiet?

01:36:48.364 --> 01:36:51.592
Lieutenant Tejada,
it's Rowena Price.

01:36:52.043 --> 01:36:55.108
I think we sent the wrong man
to prison. Miles attacked me.

01:36:55.307 --> 01:36:57.695
You got to get to my house.

01:36:57.897 --> 01:36:59.489
Please.
