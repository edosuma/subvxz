00:01.084 --> 00:03.246
Previously on
"Designated Survivor”...

00:03.378 --> 00:04.243
Director Foerstel is still digging,

00:04.379 --> 00:06.461
even though we managed to quash
your mother-in-law's subpoena.

00:06.590 --> 00:08.125
Now we know it's an ongoing investigation.

00:08.258 --> 00:12.252
| told my daughter that I hadn't
seen Eric Little since 1987,

00:12.387 --> 00:16.472
and that's technically not true.
| saw him briefly six months ago.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.056
[Damian] Are we gonna talk about this?

00:18.185 --> 00:19.801
-Talk about what?
-What happened between us.

00:19.937 --> 00:21.348
Nothing's happened between us.

00:21.939 --> 00:25.102
[Emily] Charlotte Thorn was a British rep.
They were touting her as a future P.M.

00:25.234 --> 00:26.645
[gunshot]

00:26.777 --> 00:28.734
-The Thorn murder?
-The Prime Minister's furious.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.149
-Perhaps I could smooth things.
-That would be great.

00:31.281 --> 00:33.147
That's five hours before Thorn was killed.

00:33.283 --> 00:35.149
Let's run her visitor
through facial recognition.

00:35.285 --> 00:36.946
Secretary Moss?

00:38.288 --> 00:39.278
[siren wails]

00:39.414 --> 00:41.075
[Sahin] In the last month,

00:41.208 --> 00:45.327
hundreds of journalists expelled
from our great nation!

00:45.462 --> 00:49.126
Voices of dissent, silenced -

00:49.258 --> 00:50.965
some of them killed!

00:51.093 --> 00:57.089
And President Turan, he breaks ground
on a brand new $20 million villa!

00:57.224 --> 00:58.589
[shouting, booing]

00:58.725 --> 01:00.591
So, what do we want to say to him?

01:00.727 --> 01:02.593
Turan must go!

01:02.729 --> 01:05.346
[all chanting] Turan must go!
Turan must go!

01:05.482 --> 01:07.314
Opposition leader Nuri Sahin

01:07.442 --> 01:09.604
has gathered activists
outside the Turkish embassy

01:09.736 --> 01:11.318
to condemn President Fatih Turan,

01:11.446 --> 01:13.278
who's in town this week
for a NATO summit.

01:13.407 --> 01:14.863
-This is...
-[television shuts off]

01:14.992 --> 01:15.982
Turan's people are already hinting

01:16.118 --> 01:18.325
they want to jack up the leases
on our airfields.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.865
| know why he needs the money.
Elections are in six months.

01:20.998 --> 01:23.831
-He's building a war chest.
-Yep. He's got a lot of votes to buy.

01:23.959 --> 01:26.792
Not with any more of our money.
We pay more than enough for those bases:

01:26.920 --> 01:28.376
$6 billion a year.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.337
Yeah, I'd be ready to break the bank, sir.

01:30.465 --> 01:33.457
The strategic value of those airfields
to NATO is enormous.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.210
We store nuclear weapons there.

01:35.345 --> 01:38.713
Without that real estate, Russia can make
the Middle East its own personal sandbox.

01:38.849 --> 01:41.056
So you need to make nice
at our joint presser:

01:41.184 --> 01:44.643
assure the world of the fundamental
importance of the U.S.-Turkey alliance.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.057
You mean give the bastard oxygen.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.975
That's a more succinct way
of putting it, yeah.

01:51.695 --> 01:54.983
[Hannah] This was taken the night
before your boss was murdered.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.732
And the gentleman you see entering
Charlotte Thorn's room there

01:57.868 --> 02:00.200
is Secretary of State Cornelius Moss.

02:00.329 --> 02:02.411
| don't know anything about that.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.405
You didn't know
they were carrying on an affair?

02:04.541 --> 02:07.078
-No.
-Quite a secret to keep from an assistant

02:07.210 --> 02:09.747
you were joined at the hip with
for the past seven years.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.292
Which is his way of saying
we don't believe you.

02:15.010 --> 02:18.093
They met at a human rights conference
in Dubai last year.

02:18.221 --> 02:20.929
-Was it serious?
-It was headed that way.

02:21.058 --> 02:24.767
Charlotte was still finalizing
her divorce, so they kept it discreet.

02:24.895 --> 02:28.013
They met all over the world.
But it was petering out.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.606
-Why do you think that?
-Because they started arguing.

02:30.734 --> 02:31.940
| don't know about what.

02:32.069 --> 02:34.401
Do you know
when their last argument was?

02:37.032 --> 02:39.694
Secretary Moss came by her office
for an hour

02:39.826 --> 02:41.783
on the afternoon of the 21st.

02:41.912 --> 02:44.529
-The day before she was killed.
-Yes.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.073
There were raised voices.
He left quite unhappy.

02:47.209 --> 02:49.200
And you didn't think
to tell us any of this.

02:49.336 --> 02:53.330
Secretary Moss is a former President.
He couldn't have killed her.

02:54.216 --> 02:57.299
Okay. It is not your job
to protect his reputation.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.338
I'm not protecting his reputation.

03:00.097 --> 03:03.806
Charlotte was a beacon
of moral authority to millions.

03:03.934 --> 03:06.392
How do you think
she's going to be remembered

03:06.520 --> 03:10.559
if it comes out that she was having an
affair before her divorce was even final?

03:11.024 --> 03:12.856
[voice breaking] Excuse me.

03:17.698 --> 03:18.813
-[door closes]
-[sighs]

03:18.949 --> 03:20.781
You're an ex-President.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.735
The woman you've been sleeping with
kicks you to the curb.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.736
How's that conversation go?

03:26.957 --> 03:30.120
Probably better than the one
we're going to have with him.

03:30.794 --> 03:33.252
| can't believe
I'm actually in the Oval Office.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.166
-It's cool, right?
-Yeah.

03:35.298 --> 03:38.131
-I'll show you Air Force One later.
-Really?

03:38.260 --> 03:39.842
And you gotta check out
the Lincoln Bedroom.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.132
-I'd love to.
-[tap-tap on door]

03:42.806 --> 03:44.547
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

03:45.392 --> 03:46.678
Dad, this is Sibyl.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.346
Sibyl, my dad.

03:48.478 --> 03:51.095
-It's an honor to meet you, Mr. President.
-It's very nice to meet you.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.517
Is my son being a gracious host?

03:52.649 --> 03:54.185
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.775
You're the first person
he's wanted to show his new home to.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.404
Leo, okay if I go freshen up?

04:00.991 --> 04:02.652
Yeah, just around the corner.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.286
Thanks.

04:06.621 --> 04:07.998
It's been an honor, sir.

04:08.123 --> 04:10.034
It's very nice
to finally meet you, Sibyl.

04:10.167 --> 04:12.158
Just over there to the left.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.877
Dad, you were supposed
to run into us at 10:00 sharp.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.543
-It's 10:12. I figured you weren't coming.
-I know, I'm sorry. I got busy.

04:18.675 --> 04:19.880
You totally killed the vibe.

04:20.010 --> 04:22.877
Wow. "Thanks, Dad,
for letting me use the Oval Office."

04:23.013 --> 04:25.380
I'm sorry, I just... I really like her.

04:25.515 --> 04:28.849
| know you do. I know. She's lovely.

04:29.853 --> 04:32.060
Gonna go check on her,
make sure she's okay.

04:32.189 --> 04:33.429
Yeah, okay.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.225
[sighs]

04:38.361 --> 04:40.944
-How's it going?
-Not so good.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.239
Should've shown her
the Lincoln Bedroom.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.699
That's what I would've done.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.704
[Alex] Mom, I just want
to say this again.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.369
You do not have to talk to the FBI.

04:53.502 --> 04:57.086
The subpoena that Director Foerstel
issued to you was quashed.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.376
Right, because he didn't know
about my little run-in

04:59.508 --> 05:02.546
with Eric Little six months ago.
And neither did you.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.213
I'm not blaming you.

05:04.346 --> 05:08.761
My point is that if he finds out,
he just issues another subpoena, right?

05:08.892 --> 05:09.848
He'd have to.

05:09.976 --> 05:14.265
| started all this because I took
that bribe. And I will finish it.

05:14.397 --> 05:17.230
The goal is to convince Director Foerstel
that Icarus Astrotech

05:17.359 --> 05:20.442
had no "pattern of influence”
that leads to the White House.

05:20.570 --> 05:21.560
| understand that.

05:21.696 --> 05:24.404
All he's gonna want to talk about
is Eric Little.

05:24.533 --> 05:28.276
And as long as I steer him away
from my recent meeting with him,

05:28.411 --> 05:31.620
then everything's fine, right?

05:31.748 --> 05:33.409
Yes. That's the whole game.

05:33.542 --> 05:36.375
Do not volunteer anything about
what happened six months ago.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.460
You focus on what happened
30 years ago,

05:38.588 --> 05:40.920
where the statute of limitations
has expired.

05:41.049 --> 05:44.963
And if Director Foerstel doesn't bring up
the most recent Eric Little meeting,

05:45.095 --> 05:47.587
then your candor will go a long
way towards convincing him

05:47.722 --> 05:49.508
that there's no conspiracy,

05:50.100 --> 05:52.558
which means we may be home free.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.597
And if he does bring it up?

05:57.357 --> 06:00.600
Then, at least we've gotten
in front of it.

06:04.406 --> 06:07.944
The United States and Turkey have a
long-standing friendship and partnership,

06:08.076 --> 06:12.161
one rooted in the shared respect
and understanding of our common values.

06:12.289 --> 06:15.623
More than $17 billion in bilateral trade
last year alone -

06:15.750 --> 06:18.788
a strong strategic alliance
that protects the region.

06:18.920 --> 06:22.254
And a strategic alliance that is
centered around forward Air Force bases,

06:22.382 --> 06:25.670
whose long-term leases
we look forward to renegotiating.

06:25.802 --> 06:29.636
It is this abiding connection between
our countries that we want to maintain,

06:31.266 --> 06:35.009
which is why I'm so troubled that
America continues to give safe haven

06:35.145 --> 06:37.432
to Nuri Sahin,
an enemy of the Turkish people.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.931
-What is Turan doing?
-Going off book.

06:40.066 --> 06:43.650
Mr. Sahin staged an unsuccessful coup
against my government.

06:44.154 --> 06:46.862
-And now he has found sanctuary here.
-Way off book.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.357
President Turan and I have
a difference of opinion here.

06:49.492 --> 06:53.281
Nuri Sahin is a visiting professor
at Georgetown University.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.825
He abides by our laws, and he is welcome,

06:55.957 --> 06:59.200
-as long as he grades on a curve.
-[light laughter]

06:59.336 --> 07:01.873
So then you continue to provide
the terrorist safe harbor.

07:02.005 --> 07:03.370
Everybody, we're going
to go ahead and adjourn

07:03.506 --> 07:05.372
to the East Room for photos now.
Thank you very much.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.010
-Thank you.
-[reporters shouting]

07:07.135 --> 07:10.469
Sir, maybe you want to take a few minutes
and calm down before you go in there?

07:10.597 --> 07:11.883
What are you talking about? I'm calm.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.507
-You don't look calm.
-I'm calm!

07:15.518 --> 07:16.804
Oh, boy.

07:17.812 --> 07:20.520
Mr. President, with all due respect,
what the hell was that?

07:20.649 --> 07:22.606
| think the meaning was clear.

07:22.984 --> 07:25.396
Then perhaps you're in need
of a diplomatic primer.

07:25.528 --> 07:28.486
Prepared statements serve a purpose,
so neither side can embarrass the other.

07:28.615 --> 07:29.776
I'm not embarrassed.

07:30.492 --> 07:33.655
But you should be, for giving asylum
to an enemy of our state.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.369
We have not given asylum to anyone.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.829
Then extradite Sahin
so he can face justice!

07:37.958 --> 07:40.416
There's no legal basis for that.
He hasn't committed a crime.

07:40.543 --> 07:43.251
In your country.
In ours, he's a murderer;

07:43.380 --> 07:45.712
97 civilian casualties
in the coup attempt.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.547
Our intelligence shows
that the coup attempt

07:47.676 --> 07:49.758
was carried out by a faction
of the Turkish military.

07:49.886 --> 07:53.049
-Mr. Sahin had nothing to do with it.
-Your intelligence is flawed!

07:53.181 --> 07:56.549
And so is your impulse to interfere
with domestic Turkish affairs.

07:56.685 --> 07:58.096
Quite the opposite, sir.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.265
If we had extradited him,
then we would have interfered.

08:00.397 --> 08:03.230
| wonder if Turkey had welcomed
Patrick Lloyd,

08:03.358 --> 08:05.144
whether you'd feel the same way?

08:06.236 --> 08:10.230
Mr. President, that comparison
is not even worthy of a response.

08:11.408 --> 08:13.740
And you are no longer worthy
of our bases.

08:14.661 --> 08:18.871
But perhaps Russia is, Mr. President.

08:22.419 --> 08:24.660
[theme music]

08:32.679 --> 08:34.135
[all chanting] Turan must go!

08:34.264 --> 08:36.130
Turan must go!

08:36.265 --> 08:37.347
Turan must go!

08:39.436 --> 08:40.972
| was blown away by last night.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.309
Thanks again.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.305
Sorry I didn't get to show you
the Residence.

08:44.441 --> 08:46.227
Next time?

08:46.359 --> 08:47.736
[chanting continues]

08:47.861 --> 08:49.477
Uh, let's cut up Waterside.

08:49.612 --> 08:52.195
But the cafe I wanted to show you
is just around the corner.

08:52.323 --> 08:55.611
-Here, grab one. We need all hands.
-Sorry, I'm not interested.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.326
You're not interested in what,
human rights?

08:57.454 --> 08:58.944
The violent suppression of dissent?
Mass arrests?

08:59.080 --> 09:01.321
Too busy spending all of Daddy's money
to give a crap about anybo--

09:01.458 --> 09:02.823
-Hey! Get out of her face!
-Leo!

09:02.959 --> 09:06.293
Get him out of here. Let's go.
Clear the area.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.592
Right now, Nuri Sahin
is the only realistic hope

09:10.717 --> 09:12.458
for a democratic, secular Turkey.

09:12.594 --> 09:14.460
Which is why he poses
such a threat to Turan.

09:14.596 --> 09:17.258
And why Turan's on the warpath.
My contacts at NATO are telling me

09:17.390 --> 09:19.677
that he wants to bring a motion
to censure the United States.

09:19.809 --> 09:22.346
That's absurd. We cover
nearly a quarter of NATO's budget.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.846
-The vote will never carry.
-No, of course not.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.346
But passing the motion
isn't Turan's goal.

09:26.483 --> 09:29.316
-What is?
-Undermining us on the world stage.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.856
And with the limited good will
the Administration has banked abroad,

09:31.988 --> 09:34.025
we can't afford our allies
to be taking jabs, sir.

09:34.157 --> 09:35.818
And this isn't even a jab.
It's a roundhouse.

09:35.950 --> 09:38.942
He's right, sir. We can't let
this motion come up for a vote.

09:39.079 --> 09:42.492
Aaron, apparently President Turan is
getting ready to move against us in NATO.

09:42.624 --> 09:45.707
I've heard, sir. I just got a draft
of the measure. It's a stinging rebuke.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.451
Well, we'll have Secretary Moss block it.

09:47.587 --> 09:51.080
Actually, sir, there's been
an issue with the Secretary.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.715
He's recently emerged
as a person of interest

09:53.843 --> 09:56.175
in the murder investigation
of Charlotte Thorn.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.715
[scoffs]
What the hell are you talking about?

09:57.847 --> 09:59.133
He was having an affair with her

09:59.265 --> 10:01.472
and was seen at her apartment
a few hours before the murder.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.966
Are you kidding?

10:03.603 --> 10:05.935
-Did he disclose this to anyone?
-No, sir.

10:06.064 --> 10:08.101
He was too busy involving himself
in the investigation.

10:08.233 --> 10:11.191
-Have you talked to him?
-Not yet. We wanted to apprise you first.

10:12.529 --> 10:15.521
[sighs]
Son of a bitch!

10:15.657 --> 10:18.649
We're talking about
a former President here.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.321
| know him. He...

10:20.954 --> 10:24.072
He's my friend. There has to be
a reasonable explanation.

10:24.207 --> 10:27.791
And he should be afforded the same
presumption of innocence as anyone else.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.414
But he cannot be allowed
to obstruct this investigation,

10:30.547 --> 10:32.254
not even in the slightest. Understood?

10:32.382 --> 10:34.214
Yes, sir. I'll tell Hannah.
She'll thread the needle.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.424
Secretary Moss is also
the U.S. representative

10:36.553 --> 10:39.420
on NATO's Defense and Security Committee,
which meets here later this afternoon.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.763
It would be improper for him
to attend given these facts, sir.

10:41.891 --> 10:45.350
-If you sideline him, he'll suspect why.
-Not if I go in his stead.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.855
Let them know I'll be stepping in.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.937
-Will do.
-[sighs]

10:49.065 --> 10:52.899
Sir, we can't afford an international
black eye with Turkey.

10:53.027 --> 10:56.361
We simply can't, not after Kunami. Not
while Thorn's murder is still unsolved.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.820
| agree.

10:57.949 --> 11:00.782
Emily, start working with Seth
on a P.R. counter-offensive.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.948
Lyor, Aaron; reach out to our allies.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.242
Let them know that our bond
with Turkey is unbreakable.

11:06.374 --> 11:09.162
-We need to nip this in the bud.
-[all] Yes, sir.

11:14.048 --> 11:17.291
-Sir, you're needed in the Residence.
-Thank you, Mike. I'll be right there.

11:17.427 --> 11:19.213
You should come now, sir.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.880
Hey, get out of her face!

11:23.016 --> 11:26.304
[agent] Get him out of here.
Let's go. Clear the area.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.928
-It's not what it looks like.
-Really? 'Cause what it looks like

11:29.063 --> 11:31.054
is you and your girlfriend went
to a political demonstration.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.352
What the hell were you thinking?

11:32.483 --> 11:34.770
No, I didn't.
| wasn't there for the protest, Dad.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.024
Well, we're listening.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.939
Sibyl and I were walking to breakfast.

11:41.075 --> 11:42.816
This guy comes out of nowhere
and confronts her.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.818
-And you pushed him?
-Well, I pushed him away.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.820
He got in her face,
and she's like 90 pounds.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.414
I'm sorry, Dad, but if that was Mom,
what would you have done?

11:49.542 --> 11:51.704
What kind of exposure is he looking at
for this sort of thing?

11:51.836 --> 11:53.452
We could argue defense of others

11:53.588 --> 11:55.875
so they'd have a hard time
making out assault.

11:56.007 --> 11:59.841
Misdemeanor disturbing the peace if the
D.A. wants to make a name for himself.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.960
But then we could argue
selective prosecution.

12:02.096 --> 12:03.473
Prosecution?

12:03.598 --> 12:05.760
We're not gonna let anything bad
happen to you, okay?

12:05.892 --> 12:07.883
Will this affect
my college applications?

12:08.019 --> 12:11.762
No. You're gonna have to explain it like
you just did to us, but we'll handle it.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.640
-[phone ringing]
- need to go check on Sibyl.

12:15.652 --> 12:16.813
Yeah.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.273
Okay, thank you.

12:19.405 --> 12:23.740
That was Kendra. That guy he pushed
just hired Bella Conroy.

12:23.868 --> 12:26.485
Oh, so here comes the civil suit.

12:26.621 --> 12:28.077
Yeah.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.871
| checked with Secretary Moss'
Secret Service detail.

12:33.002 --> 12:36.040
He went off the grid about 11:00 p.m.
the night before Thorn's murder.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.458
He resurfaced the next evening.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.206
Is disappearing like that usual?

12:39.342 --> 12:42.380
It happens when ex-Presidents
want privacy.

12:42.512 --> 12:46.471
But Secretary Moss is also protected
by the State Department's DSS.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.055
And he slipped them, too.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.515
Thanks, Mike.

12:49.644 --> 12:53.558
We need to find out what Moss was up to
when he ditched his security.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.476
| can fill in part of the puzzle.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.064
Moss had a credit-card charge

12:57.193 --> 12:59.651
at a ritzy private medical
facility in Georgetown

12:59.779 --> 13:01.690
called Ravenwood Hill at 10:00 a.m.

13:01.823 --> 13:04.565
A few hours after the murder.
Defensive injuries?

13:04.701 --> 13:07.819
Nothing on Thorn's body suggests
a struggle, just the gunshot wound.

13:08.538 --> 13:11.200
Charles, can you tell us
what he was up to in that facility?

13:11.332 --> 13:13.198
Not without a subpoena.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.620
| don't mess with medical records.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.834
What if it was something
that was technically non-medical,

13:19.966 --> 13:24.301
like hours of admission,
something like that?

13:25.972 --> 13:27.258
Gimme a sec.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.511
[keyboard clicking]

13:33.396 --> 13:37.515
Moss self-admitted at 8:30
in the morning, discharged at 9:00 p.m.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.774
[reporters shouting]

13:46.909 --> 13:48.411
What was Leo doing at the rally?

13:48.536 --> 13:50.402
The President doesn't comment
on family matters.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.279
Our sources indicate
that the man Leo pushed,

13:52.415 --> 13:55.077
Peter Potuck, wants to press charges.
Has the D.A. been in touch?

13:55.209 --> 13:57.291
The President doesn't comment
on family matters.

13:57.420 --> 13:58.581
-[shouting]
-Seth, come on!

13:58.713 --> 14:01.580
The YouTube video of Leo's scuffle
already has nine million hits.

14:01.716 --> 14:02.877
The victim hired Bella Conroy.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.546
You seem to know everything already,
Tiffany, so why are you asking me?

14:05.678 --> 14:08.466
-We're asking for confirmation.
- I can confirm that's all I have.

14:08.598 --> 14:09.963
The victim's clearly pressing charges.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.261
If that's clear,
then what do you need me for?

14:12.393 --> 14:14.475
-Is the President concerned about the--
-[TV shuts off]

14:14.604 --> 14:16.470
Well, the good news is,
if the Moss story breaks,

14:16.606 --> 14:19.143
another story might push it
off the front page. The bad news is--

14:19.275 --> 14:20.857
The President sees the dilemma, Lyor.

14:20.985 --> 14:23.647
Yeah... I'm saying we have
to cauterize something, sir.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.270
My vote is the civil suit.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.613
| already reached out to Conroy
to set up a meeting.

14:27.742 --> 14:29.232
What do you think she's looking for?

14:29.369 --> 14:31.576
My guess: a little publicity,
a few hundred grand.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.320
[sighs] I've watched
the video six times.

14:33.456 --> 14:36.494
The guy is twice the size of my son,
went down like a sack of potatoes.

14:36.626 --> 14:39.789
He probably figured out it was Leo.
He's using the threat of criminal charges

14:39.921 --> 14:41.286
as leverage. Sir, write a check.

14:41.422 --> 14:44.835
-You're right. Make it disappear.
-Yes, sir.

14:47.095 --> 14:50.338
[Hannah] Mr. Secretary, we realize
these are uncomfortable questions.

14:50.473 --> 14:53.511
Asking my whereabouts when
a Member of Parliament was killed?

14:53.643 --> 14:55.759
Why would you think
that'd be uncomfortable?

14:55.895 --> 14:58.353
We're not trying to offend you, sir.
We're trying to exonerate you.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.597
| don't need to be exonerated, son.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.974
Of course not, sir.
Because you didn't do anything.

15:03.111 --> 15:07.230
-So if you could just give us your alibi--
-I will do nothing of the sort.

15:07.365 --> 15:09.652
Then maybe you can tell us
what you were doing at Ravenwood.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.158
That's none of your business.

15:13.287 --> 15:16.370
Sir, if you don't answer our questions,
it puts us in an awkward position.

15:16.499 --> 15:17.830
And puts you in one, too.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.786
Are you telling me I need a lawyer?

15:23.297 --> 15:24.879
| don't know, sir. Do you?

15:28.010 --> 15:29.512
Good day, Agent Wells.

15:45.319 --> 15:48.562
[Kendra] Peter Potuck's attorney
says their opening salvo is $8 million.

15:48.698 --> 15:49.654
What?

15:49.782 --> 15:51.398
-For a lousy push?
-That's ridiculous.

15:51.534 --> 15:53.525
| spent my entire career as a professor.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.368
They know I don't have
that kind of money.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.828
Maybe it's not a shakedown.
Maybe Potuck's looking for publicity.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.573
Or a special interest is staking him.

15:59.709 --> 16:02.076
You know, someone on the wrong side
of an Administration policy.

16:02.211 --> 16:04.748
-Mike.
-I'll look into it, sir.

16:04.881 --> 16:08.215
Sir, Agent Wells spoke to Secretary Moss.
He refused to cooperate.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.300
I'm very disappointed to hear that.

16:11.429 --> 16:14.012
Emily, I need you to have
a come-to-Jesus talk with him.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.427
Will do, sir, after NATO's Defense
and Security Committee meeting,

16:16.559 --> 16:18.721
-which we are late for.
-Let's go.

16:20.062 --> 16:22.554
| do not understand
why my motion to censure

16:22.690 --> 16:25.057
the United States cannot be
brought to the Assembly floor.

16:25.193 --> 16:27.059
Parliamentary procedure,
President Turan.

16:27.195 --> 16:30.062
None of the other member nations
are willing to second that motion.

16:30.198 --> 16:31.859
Because President Kirkman
has threatened all of them!

16:31.991 --> 16:35.279
Be careful, sir.
That is defamatory and false.

16:35.411 --> 16:37.527
You harbor a criminal, sir.

16:37.663 --> 16:38.994
That makes you a criminal.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.956
If the honorable President from Turkey
is finished with his little outburst,

16:42.084 --> 16:43.916
| believe the committee has
important work to do.

16:44.045 --> 16:46.878
Yes, the distribution of NATO's assets.

16:47.006 --> 16:50.544
The mutual defense and security
this committee is supposed to address!

16:50.676 --> 16:52.633
And which you are allowing
President Kirkman to undermine!

16:52.762 --> 16:55.049
The only one
who's undermining us is you...

16:55.181 --> 16:58.640
by threatening to pull back leases
for air bases that protect us all.

16:58.768 --> 17:00.258
Protection is a two-way street.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.101
We won't give it if we don't get it.

17:02.230 --> 17:03.971
[representative] A point of procedure,
Mr. Secretary General.

17:04.106 --> 17:08.646
If President Turan is unwilling to address
the business of this committee,

17:08.778 --> 17:11.065
| think he should be censured.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.814
That won't be necessary.

17:13.950 --> 17:18.069
It is apparent Turkey's interests
are no longer of value to NATO.

17:18.204 --> 17:21.742
So NATO is no longer
of value to Turkey.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.457
We'll be sending a formal notice
of withdrawal.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.537
This is no good, Tom.
No good at all.

17:28.673 --> 17:31.085
-Florian, he's bluffing.
-He's not.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.753
We've already received the paperwork.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.343
-The global implications of this--
-He's behaving like a bully.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.803
He's trying to see how much
he can behave like a dictator

17:37.932 --> 17:39.422
within our democratic body.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.675
And if we don't check him now,
the bar will move,

17:41.811 --> 17:45.020
and we'll never be able to move it back.
Look, I understand your concern.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.979
If we don't maintain
a stronghold in Turkey,

17:47.108 --> 17:49.975
we potentially open up the Middle East
for Russian dominance.

17:50.111 --> 17:52.603
Which affects the balance of power
in Eurasia, too.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.991
This could incite another cold war.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.407
What would you have me do?

17:58.661 --> 18:00.493
| think you know the answer
to that question.

18:02.498 --> 18:05.616
If I make Nuri Sahin go back to Turkey...

18:05.751 --> 18:08.243
[sighs]
...there won't be a trial.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.836
It'll be a firing squad, and you know it.

18:10.965 --> 18:11.830
He's one man, sir.

18:11.966 --> 18:15.209
My country was predicated
on the idea that one man matters.

18:15.344 --> 18:17.335
One man can make a difference.

18:17.471 --> 18:20.554
One American, perhaps.
But Sahin is Turkish.

18:20.683 --> 18:24.142
And 29 countries are counting on you
to keep NATO intact.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.136
The world is counting, sir.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.022
Seth? Hey! Seth?

18:33.154 --> 18:35.361
Tiffany, there's another briefing
at 6:00 p.m.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.230
| know. I wanted
to speak to you privately.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.403
-Make it fast.
-It's about the President's family.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.948
-I have nothing to say about Leo Kirkman.
-It's about the President's mother-in-law.

18:47.043 --> 18:49.751
-Good, I have your attention.
-What is it?

18:49.879 --> 18:51.665
| understand that
the President's mother-in-law

18:51.797 --> 18:54.175
is meeting with Director Foerstel today.
Do I have that right?

18:54.300 --> 18:57.008
-No comment.
-Good, I have it right.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.968
| want a sit-down
with the President, Seth.

18:59.096 --> 19:02.054
-That's not gonna happen.
-Okay. I know that you don't think

19:02.183 --> 19:04.220
that I have enough to go to press,
but I do.

19:04.352 --> 19:07.595
Icarus and heart transplants and bribes.
It's all very salacious.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.437
And I'm guessing the President
would want an opportunity

19:09.565 --> 19:11.101
to give his family's side of things.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.645
Otherwise, these articles
can seem so one-sided.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.110
What's your time frame?

19:16.238 --> 19:18.275
-Thirty minutes.
-Are you out of your mind?

19:18.407 --> 19:20.068
The President has a full agenda today.

19:20.201 --> 19:22.192
You may have chutzpah,
but you don't have a deadline.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.786
-You're an e-zine.
-Who competes against the big boys now,

19:24.914 --> 19:26.780
and we like to get the scoop.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.577
Thirty minutes, Seth.

19:31.962 --> 19:33.794
-So Gimble has us.
-Yes, sir.

19:33.923 --> 19:37.257
And she wants to do the interview now
so we can't coordinate with Eva.

19:37.385 --> 19:39.467
Gimble's gonna publish
with or without our cooperation.

19:39.595 --> 19:42.462
But sitting down with her gives you
an opportunity to spin things.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.760
The problem is, we don't know
what you're walking into.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.599
We don't know
the extent of Gimble's intel.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.138
Eva's recent meeting with Little;

19:48.270 --> 19:49.647
-that's the danger zone.
-Yes, sir.

19:49.772 --> 19:52.309
If Gimble and Foerstel both ask
about that, you and Eva risk

19:52.441 --> 19:54.819
contradicting each other,
which would look like thirty years

19:54.944 --> 19:57.185
of Icarus getting contracts
while greasing the First Family.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.562
And let's not forget to throw
a dead body into the mix.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.189
Eric Little's murder is still unsolved.

20:01.325 --> 20:04.613
All of which would give Foerstel
ammunition to widen his investigation.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.736
But if the Little meeting
doesn't come up,

20:06.872 --> 20:09.204
my cooperation might get
Gimble to stop digging.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.291
It might, but the downside's enormous.

20:13.129 --> 20:14.290
It's Russian roulette.

20:16.090 --> 20:18.502
NATO's coming apart,
my son is being sued,

20:18.634 --> 20:21.001
my mentor is a potential murder suspect,

20:21.137 --> 20:24.596
and my mother-in-law's
being grilled by the FBI.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.466
And I'm just sitting here
watching the world burn.

20:30.104 --> 20:33.313
It's time to pick up a bucket.
Set up the interview.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.652
It breaks with etiquette
for a former President

20:47.788 --> 20:50.029
to be summoned
to a Chief of Staff's office.

20:50.166 --> 20:52.032
Well, it breaks with etiquette

20:52.168 --> 20:54.660
for a former President
to have to be summoned.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.001
Please.

20:58.674 --> 21:01.211
I'm advising you that we are now
on the record, sir.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.299
| understand.

21:02.428 --> 21:05.170
How long had you and Ms. Thorn
been involved?

21:05.306 --> 21:06.171
Five months.

21:06.307 --> 21:08.139
-Was it serious?
-She wanted it to be.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.678
| was a little more circumspect.

21:09.810 --> 21:12.598
What were you two arguing about
the day before she died?

21:15.524 --> 21:17.481
Secretary Moss?

21:19.779 --> 21:21.861
Well, she gave me an ultimatum.

21:23.032 --> 21:25.069
She told me she expected a ring.

21:25.201 --> 21:28.944
| made a joke, said she already had one.
She said that was a friendship ring.

21:29.538 --> 21:32.121
And then, I said
| didn't like being pushed.

21:32.249 --> 21:34.911
-And how did you leave it?
-She told me it was over.

21:35.044 --> 21:38.207
| told her she was being foolish,
and I walked out.

21:39.048 --> 21:42.211
| went back to her hotel later that night
to see if we could...

21:42.676 --> 21:44.667
-work things out.
-And did you?

21:45.679 --> 21:46.805
No.

21:47.681 --> 21:51.049
Where were you the morning
that Charlotte Thorn was killed?

21:52.686 --> 21:54.347
I'm not at liberty to discuss that.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.222
Why did you check yourself into
Ravenwood Hill Medical Facility

21:57.358 --> 21:58.393
hours after her murder?

21:58.526 --> 22:00.108
-It's not relevant.
-Sir--

22:00.236 --> 22:03.228
| swear to you I did not Kill
Charlotte Thorn.

22:07.076 --> 22:09.238
| cared deeply about her.

22:14.542 --> 22:16.078
That's all I have to say.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.786
The President has instructed me
to advise you

22:19.922 --> 22:22.789
that until such time as you fully
cooperate, you are suspended.

22:25.386 --> 22:27.297
Please tell the President for me

22:27.429 --> 22:30.717
that |, better than anyone,
appreciate his position,

22:31.225 --> 22:34.058
and that I hope when this is
solved and my name is cleared,

22:34.520 --> 22:36.431
| can continue to serve him.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.982
[door opens, closes]

22:42.111 --> 22:43.772
Mr. President,

22:43.904 --> 22:47.147
are you familiar with a deceased Icarus
Astrotech employee named Eric Little?

22:47.283 --> 22:51.322
Yes, but only in the context of
the FBI inquiry into my mother-in-law.

22:51.453 --> 22:56.243
Are you aware that Eva Booker was
the recipient of a bribe from him in 19877

22:56.375 --> 22:58.787
Tiffany, I thought we'd agreed
you were gonna confine your questions

22:58.919 --> 23:00.956
to matters of which the President
had personal knowledge.

23:01.088 --> 23:02.795
This isn't a court of law, Seth.
It's an interview.

23:02.923 --> 23:05.961
Seth, it's fine.
| am aware of the bribe.

23:06.093 --> 23:10.257
But again, only in the context of
the FBI inquiry into my mother-in-law.

23:11.390 --> 23:15.805
[Eva] Yes, I knew I was being
offered a bribe by Mr. Little.

23:15.936 --> 23:18.268
-And you knew that it was wrong.
-Yes.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.432
And I'd do it again.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.852
Point of clarification:
did you do it again, Mrs. Booker?

23:21.984 --> 23:24.021
-No.
-Are you aware that six months ago,

23:24.153 --> 23:26.269
the Department of Defense
awarded Icarus Astrotech,

23:26.405 --> 23:28.487
Mr. Little's company,
a billion-dollar contract?

23:28.991 --> 23:30.072
No.

23:30.993 --> 23:32.859
Are you aware
that the Icarus employee

23:32.995 --> 23:34.736
who executed that contract
was Mr. Little?

23:34.872 --> 23:36.658
If she didn't know about the contract,
how would she know--

23:36.790 --> 23:38.497
I'd like her to answer.

23:41.170 --> 23:44.208
-No.
-So you were not aware that the D.O.D.

23:44.340 --> 23:46.627
authorized a billion-dollar contract
to Icarus Astrotech?

23:46.759 --> 23:50.127
No. I have a great deal
of respect for Secretary Grimaldi.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.594
He has an excellent staff,
and I don't micro-manage him.

23:55.142 --> 23:56.428
[phone buzzes]

24:03.609 --> 24:05.475
We'd like to take a brief break.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.022
I'm going to object to that.

24:07.613 --> 24:10.731
I'd like to remind you, Mr. Foerstel,
that we are here voluntarily.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.732
Yes, and you've voluntarily
agreed to my guidelines.

24:12.868 --> 24:14.984
And they include a ban
on coordination of testimony.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.201
Coordination with whom?

24:17.373 --> 24:18.488
Really?

24:18.624 --> 24:20.661
Coordination with whom,
Director Foerstel?

24:20.793 --> 24:22.830
Why would you assume
that we are coordinating

24:22.962 --> 24:24.703
Mrs. Booker's testimony with anyone?

24:24.838 --> 24:27.045
I'm not gonna assume anything,
provided we continue.

24:30.469 --> 24:33.302
Mr. President, do you understand
why the contract

24:33.430 --> 24:35.512
has the appearance of impropriety,

24:35.641 --> 24:37.973
particularly
in light of Mr. Little's murder?

24:38.644 --> 24:40.601
Yes, I think I do.

24:40.729 --> 24:44.188
Sometimes, journalists,
through no fault of their own,

24:44.316 --> 24:47.650
seek to find a story
even when there is no story there.

24:48.654 --> 24:51.271
You haven't exactly been
the most transparent of Presidents.

24:51.407 --> 24:52.738
Now, I take exception to that.

24:52.866 --> 24:55.278
| think I've gone to great lengths
to be as transparent as possible.

24:55.411 --> 24:59.200
Now obviously, there are limits when
matters of national security are involved.

24:59.331 --> 25:03.165
So you admit that you're not always
honest with the American people?

25:05.337 --> 25:07.954
Have you made any large purchases
in the past six months?

25:08.090 --> 25:09.080
Define large.

25:09.216 --> 25:11.048
Above $1,000.

25:11.260 --> 25:12.421
No.

25:12.553 --> 25:15.136
Have there been any irregularly
large deposits in your accounts

25:15.264 --> 25:16.379
over the past six months?

25:16.515 --> 25:18.756
Director Foerstel,
Mrs. Booker has already stated

25:18.892 --> 25:20.678
she has not accepted a monetary bribe.

25:20.811 --> 25:22.142
Yes, but given her history,

25:22.271 --> 25:24.387
you understand why I can't take
this assertion at face value.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.685
We'll provide copies
of her bank statements.

25:27.151 --> 25:28.357
Thank you.

25:31.447 --> 25:33.609
| have just one more question,
Mrs. Booker.

25:33.741 --> 25:36.574
Six months ago, did you take
a vacation on St. Lucia?

25:36.702 --> 25:40.741
Specifically, did you stay
at a hotel called the Grand Balfour?

25:41.457 --> 25:42.663
Yes.

25:42.791 --> 25:44.122
How did you afford that holiday?

25:44.251 --> 25:47.243
My husband left me an annuity,

25:47.379 --> 25:51.748
and every year, my daughter and |
take one trip together.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.795
Last year, it was Bermuda and...

25:54.636 --> 25:56.297
This year, it was St. Lucia.

25:57.306 --> 26:01.140
Mr. Foerstel, Mrs. Booker's been here
a long time. If there's nothing further.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.597
No, there's nothing further.

26:03.729 --> 26:06.346
Thank you so much
for your cooperation, Mrs. Booker.

26:06.482 --> 26:07.722
Thank you.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.104
Why don't you ask me
the question that you want to ask?

26:11.236 --> 26:12.488
Sir?

26:12.613 --> 26:14.195
Just ask the question. I'll answer it.

26:14.323 --> 26:16.405
That way, we can stop
dancing around each other.

26:16.533 --> 26:17.989
All right.

26:20.287 --> 26:24.372
Can you assure the American people that
your family is not presently involved

26:24.500 --> 26:27.788
in any type of pay-for-play arrangement
with Icarus Astrotech?

26:27.920 --> 26:32.505
Yes, I can, because there is
no corrupt relationship with Icarus.

26:32.633 --> 26:37.048
Nothing nefarious is being orchestrated
by my mother-in-law, my wife, or me.

26:37.179 --> 26:41.218
| took a pledge to serve
the American people, not myself,

26:41.350 --> 26:43.682
and I am doing that
to the best of my ability.

26:43.811 --> 26:45.347
| give you my word.

26:47.481 --> 26:49.643
Kendra said Mrs. Booker came through
with flying colors.

26:49.775 --> 26:51.482
-So did you, Mr. President.
-We'll see.

26:51.610 --> 26:54.978
I'm only grateful that she didn't know
about Eva's last meeting with Eric Little.

26:55.114 --> 26:58.323
And Gimble's piece will be about
a 30-year-old bribe to save a man's life.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.440
That's gonna lack teeth.

26:59.576 --> 27:00.828
It's not all good news.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.489
Foerstel may be leaking to Gimble.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.908
Not a chance. John Foerstel
may be many things,

27:05.040 --> 27:06.496
but dishonorable isn't one of them.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.491
Then someone else is leaking
to both of them.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.493
In the end, we can only control
what we control.

27:10.629 --> 27:11.915
Seth, thank you for setting it up.

27:12.047 --> 27:13.549
-Great job, Mr. President.
-Yes, sir.

27:13.674 --> 27:15.460
Mr. President, Nuri Sahin is here.

27:15.592 --> 27:16.844
Thank you.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.586
| need to handle this one on my own.

27:19.721 --> 27:21.303
| understand.

27:25.310 --> 27:28.018
| know why you have called me here, sir.

27:28.564 --> 27:31.352
| know you have to send me back.

27:33.318 --> 27:34.433
I'll be honest.

27:34.570 --> 27:36.982
There has been a great deal of pressure
to do just that.

27:37.114 --> 27:38.195
| understand.

27:38.323 --> 27:40.655
President Turan is right.

27:40.784 --> 27:41.819
| am a revolutionary.

27:41.952 --> 27:44.614
Are you telling me that
you were part of the attempted coup?

27:44.746 --> 27:46.248
No, sir.

27:46.832 --> 27:49.039
But I want Turan removed.

27:49.835 --> 27:52.042
Democratically, yes, but removed.

27:53.922 --> 27:55.458
Men like that...

27:55.591 --> 27:59.255
the only thing they fear
more than bullets is the ballot box.

27:59.595 --> 28:00.676
Yes.

28:00.804 --> 28:05.048
And the pursuit of democracy
is the worthiest of causes.

28:05.184 --> 28:09.052
Like your own Nathan Hale said...

28:09.188 --> 28:15.230
"I only regret I have
but one life to give to my country.”

28:16.069 --> 28:17.446
That's correct.

28:18.947 --> 28:21.325
And he was a teacher, like you. Please.

28:23.952 --> 28:27.445
| want you to know that
you are safe here in my country.

28:28.790 --> 28:30.747
| admire what you're doing.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.958
And I can only hope that someday soon,

28:33.086 --> 28:34.793
you'll be able to return home.

28:36.423 --> 28:37.834
Thank you, sir.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.128
No, thank you.

28:46.058 --> 28:49.426
| looked into Peter Potuck, sir,
the guy Leo pushed.

28:49.895 --> 28:52.102
He works for a charity
called the Ankara Trust.

28:52.231 --> 28:54.689
It funnels money into Turan's regime.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.978
Wait a second. You're telling me...

28:57.110 --> 28:59.818
that this whole thing with Leo
was a setup,

28:59.947 --> 29:02.609
and that President Turan was behind it?

29:02.741 --> 29:04.106
Yes, sir.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.484
The charity's run by an Emre Sadik.

29:07.162 --> 29:10.120
Mr. President, Sadik has
a 17-year-old daughter, and...

29:11.333 --> 29:13.620
her name is Sibyl, sir.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.038
Leo's girlfriend?

29:15.170 --> 29:17.127
She's part of this?

29:17.673 --> 29:18.754
Yes, sir.

29:21.176 --> 29:22.678
Oh, no.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.134
| want to do a press conference

29:28.267 --> 29:30.224
denouncing President Turan
and his tactics.

29:30.352 --> 29:32.309
Sir, you can't talk about that
on a public forum.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.849
He went after my family, my son!

29:34.982 --> 29:37.644
We understand that, sir.
But Gimble is about to break a story

29:37.776 --> 29:39.562
about an investigation
into your mother-in-law.

29:39.695 --> 29:41.686
Criminal charges are only
pending against Leo.

29:41.822 --> 29:44.029
Sir, if you intervene on his behalf
by attacking Turan,

29:44.157 --> 29:46.194
you'll make the House of Borgia
look like "Romper Room."

29:46.326 --> 29:50.240
Damn it! I am tired of you people
always telling me my hands are tied!

29:51.164 --> 29:53.246
Well, there is a way to untie them.

29:53.375 --> 29:56.037
Yeah, I know, by throwing Sahin
to the lions. Not gonna happen!

29:56.169 --> 29:58.957
-Think of something else!
-[Aaron sighs]

30:00.382 --> 30:01.872
I'll do a presser with Sahin.

30:02.009 --> 30:05.092
Sir, it's not U.S. policy to give
a platform to the opposition leader.

30:05.220 --> 30:06.426
They don't know that.

30:06.555 --> 30:08.421
And they don't know
what I'm capable of.

30:08.557 --> 30:09.922
That'll be my leverage.

30:10.058 --> 30:12.265
Tell President Turan
| want to see him now.

30:12.394 --> 30:13.976
-That's all!
-Yes, sir.

30:19.443 --> 30:22.060
-You're saying she was playing me?
-Yeah.

30:22.738 --> 30:23.853
I'm really sorry, son.

30:23.989 --> 30:26.777
No. No, we spend two hours
on the phone every night.

30:26.908 --> 30:29.445
| mean, we were gonna go
on spring break together.

30:29.578 --> 30:30.488
This is a mistake!

30:30.620 --> 30:32.952
I'm afraid it's not.
| had Mike triple-check it.

30:33.081 --> 30:36.699
Sweetheart, being the President's son
means that sometimes,

30:36.835 --> 30:39.327
people don't have the purest of motives.

30:40.589 --> 30:42.546
Leo. Leo, please.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.005
Tom, leave him.

30:44.509 --> 30:45.499
[door closes]

30:45.635 --> 30:46.921
[sighs]

30:50.182 --> 30:51.923
[Hannah] Moss has been cleared
as a suspect,

30:52.059 --> 30:53.424
but he gave us a valuable lead.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.221
Charlotte Thorn wore a friendship ring.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.970
The police didn't find it on her body.

30:57.105 --> 30:59.813
Find the ring, we find the killer.

30:59.941 --> 31:01.773
[crunching]

31:02.444 --> 31:04.401
Here's one with Thorn in a necklace.

31:05.113 --> 31:06.979
Thorn and a pendant.

31:07.115 --> 31:08.856
Actually, that's a brooch.

31:09.951 --> 31:11.942
Thorn and another pendant.

31:15.457 --> 31:18.290
Here's something, at a fundraiser
the night before she was killed.

31:18.418 --> 31:19.704
Can you blow that up?

31:19.836 --> 31:21.918
[keyboard clicking]

31:22.047 --> 31:23.333
[beeping]

31:26.718 --> 31:28.334
I've seen that ring.

31:28.470 --> 31:29.460
So have I.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.553
Thank you.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.847
[Hannah] This is Charlotte at a fundraiser
the night before she was killed.

31:40.982 --> 31:42.268
And that's the ring she was wearing.

31:42.401 --> 31:43.937
[Damian] But when they found
her body a day later,

31:44.069 --> 31:47.482
there was no ring on it.
Guess who has that same exact ring?

31:48.490 --> 31:50.447
We both liked the same jewelry.

31:50.575 --> 31:52.282
Okay, here's another photo.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.869
That's you.
Same fundraiser, no ring.

31:54.996 --> 31:56.737
You can see where this is going, right?

31:56.873 --> 31:58.705
She's wearing the ring, and you're not.

31:58.834 --> 32:01.792
Then 24 hours later,
she doesn't have it and you do.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.787
And I see the setting on that ring.
There's a lot of little crevices

32:04.923 --> 32:06.960
where dead skin, DNA can lodge.

32:07.092 --> 32:10.130
So we're going to take that ring, and
we're gonna send that down to the lab.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.718
-And if your boss--
-You don't understand!

32:11.847 --> 32:14.384
We might.
It was a brutal job, sounds like,

32:14.516 --> 32:16.052
16-hour days, year after year.

32:16.184 --> 32:18.175
Handmaiden to someone famous,
unappreciated.

32:18.311 --> 32:19.392
You must've hated her.

32:19.521 --> 32:21.432
| didn't hate her! I loved her!

32:25.318 --> 32:28.401
She was in this terrible marriage
for years.

32:28.530 --> 32:30.487
And she finally gets out of it.

32:30.615 --> 32:32.993
And then I have to watch
as she falls for Secretary Moss,

32:33.118 --> 32:34.608
who doesn't care for her at all!

32:34.744 --> 32:36.326
-She broke up with him.
-Yes.

32:36.997 --> 32:38.908
[tearfully]
And I went to her, and...

32:39.040 --> 32:41.168
| told her that we could
finally be together.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.034
[sobs]

32:43.170 --> 32:45.537
And she said that she didn't want me.

32:45.672 --> 32:49.666
All those years of doing
absolutely everything for her,

32:49.801 --> 32:54.386
of leading me on,
and she was just... just using me!

32:55.140 --> 32:57.347
-So you shot her.
-Yes.

32:59.352 --> 33:01.013
She betrayed me.

33:01.146 --> 33:03.558
| loved her, but she betrayed me!

33:14.409 --> 33:16.275
A press conference with Sahin?

33:16.411 --> 33:17.526
You wouldn't dare.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.278
Not only will I, I'll do as many

33:19.414 --> 33:22.281
as I think is necessary
to convey not only to your people,

33:22.417 --> 33:26.536
but to the rest of the world that Nuri
Sahin is the only person who is capable

33:26.671 --> 33:30.289
of delivering true democracy and
opportunity to the great Turkish people,

33:30.425 --> 33:34.134
and that he alone can make his nation
a shining beacon of hope and stability

33:34.262 --> 33:36.799
in a region that is historically unstable.

33:36.932 --> 33:40.300
Hell, by the time I'm finished, you'll be
begging me not to extradite him.

33:40.435 --> 33:43.393
Because if I do, you'll be staring
straight down the barrel

33:43.522 --> 33:45.479
-at certain civil war.
-President Kirkman--

33:45.607 --> 33:46.642
Here is my one-time offer.

33:46.775 --> 33:49.142
And I want you to pay attention,
'cause there's a price to pay.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.769
Turkey will remain a NATO state.

33:51.905 --> 33:53.942
You will give us back the leases
for the air bases.

33:54.074 --> 33:55.235
This is extortion.

33:55.367 --> 33:56.983
You will drop the civil case
against my son,

33:57.118 --> 33:59.325
and your man will contact
the District Attorney's office

33:59.454 --> 34:01.741
and tell them
that he is not pressing charges.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.830
If you fail to do any one
of these things,

34:03.959 --> 34:06.166
you can watch Mr. Sahin
and myself on television

34:06.294 --> 34:07.910
delivering the first of what I hope

34:08.045 --> 34:09.956
to be many press conferences
in the Rose Garden.

34:10.090 --> 34:11.125
Are you following me?

34:11.257 --> 34:12.793
-Yes!
-Good.

34:12.926 --> 34:14.882
Because now I need to be
particularly clear,

34:15.011 --> 34:17.422
because you and |
will never speak again.

34:17.556 --> 34:19.967
If you ever try and harm
my family, I will find you,

34:20.100 --> 34:22.181
and not as the President
of the United States,

34:22.310 --> 34:24.266
but a man who is trying
to protect his own.

34:24.646 --> 34:26.228
And I promise you,

34:26.815 --> 34:28.647
that's not how you want to see me.

34:33.321 --> 34:36.905
Mike, I think you can show
President Turan the way out.

34:38.326 --> 34:39.828
Sir?

34:52.465 --> 34:54.627
| come to you a humbled man,

34:54.759 --> 34:57.091
offering an apology to his President.

34:57.220 --> 35:00.679
| know that my behavior obstructed
the Thorn murder investigation,

35:00.807 --> 35:02.468
and that was never my intent.

35:02.601 --> 35:03.966
Yet that was the effect.

35:06.646 --> 35:09.513
| cared very deeply
about Charlotte Thorn.

35:10.108 --> 35:13.066
And I wanted to be a part
of the investigation to get her justice.

35:13.194 --> 35:15.322
And you wanted to keep
your affair a secret.

35:15.447 --> 35:16.903
Yes, that too.

35:17.866 --> 35:21.905
She was the first woman I'd opened up to
in the four years since Elaine died.

35:22.037 --> 35:25.496
And part of me felt I was being disloyal,

35:25.957 --> 35:28.335
like I was dishonoring her memory.

35:30.462 --> 35:32.499
| get why you wouldn't want it
to go public.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.918
No. It's the same reason
why I pulled away

35:35.050 --> 35:38.042
when Charlotte told me
she wanted something more serious.

35:38.178 --> 35:39.839
| understand.

35:41.389 --> 35:43.300
The problem is, I didn't.

35:43.433 --> 35:46.676
| didn't understand
just how much I cared about her.

35:46.811 --> 35:50.054
So when she told me
it was over, I went home.

35:51.358 --> 35:53.065
And I started spiraling.

35:54.319 --> 35:55.605
And you slipped.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.902
Two years clean,
one night to fall off the wagon.

36:02.327 --> 36:05.069
Next morning, I checked myself
into Ravenwood...

36:06.206 --> 36:09.369
because I could not allow myself
to go down that path again.

36:09.918 --> 36:12.376
And you didn't think
you could trust me with that.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.086
No, Tom, I didn't.

36:14.547 --> 36:16.163
| felt ashamed.

36:18.009 --> 36:20.250
So I am saving you the trouble, sir.

36:21.346 --> 36:22.802
Because when I was President,

36:22.931 --> 36:25.764
you know what I'd call someone
who acted the way I have?

36:26.559 --> 36:27.845
A cab.

36:34.150 --> 36:36.403
You've made a mistake, Cornelius.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.485
| value our friendship.

36:38.613 --> 36:40.570
And I still need your counsel,
your humanity,

36:40.699 --> 36:42.656
and I think the American people do, too.

36:42.784 --> 36:46.402
But if we were somehow
to move forward as friends,

36:46.538 --> 36:48.825
| would need you
to give me your word

36:48.957 --> 36:51.574
you would never leave me
on the outside again.

36:52.794 --> 36:54.330
You have it.

36:55.380 --> 36:56.586
Thank you.

36:57.590 --> 36:58.967
All right.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.141
Do what you have to.

37:06.266 --> 37:08.758
But as soon as you're ready, come back.

37:08.893 --> 37:10.884
Your office will be waiting.

37:15.650 --> 37:16.981
Thank you, sir.

37:18.486 --> 37:20.443
Let me walk you out.

37:23.491 --> 37:25.607
[sighs]

37:27.454 --> 37:29.616
[knock on door]

37:35.420 --> 37:37.036
So, we have some unfinished business.

37:37.172 --> 37:39.163
Yeah? What sort of business?

37:40.925 --> 37:42.427
Personal business.

37:42.927 --> 37:44.008
Is that right?

38:05.366 --> 38:06.868
[sighs]

38:09.788 --> 38:11.449
[knock on door]

38:26.387 --> 38:27.673
Hey.

38:29.724 --> 38:31.180
[sighs]

38:32.477 --> 38:34.343
| can't even go to a movie.

38:36.022 --> 38:38.730
There's a screening room here
in the White House.

38:39.734 --> 38:42.021
| mean, I can't have a normal life.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.402
| know.

38:44.531 --> 38:48.069
And everyone who looks at me;
all they see is the President's son.

38:50.078 --> 38:53.241
All I can tell you is that the right girl
won't see you that way.

38:53.373 --> 38:55.740
There won't be a right girl
as long as I'm living in a bubble.

39:01.506 --> 39:03.543
| am so sorry.

39:14.936 --> 39:16.927
[Hannah] So, when are you
leaving town?

39:19.274 --> 39:20.764
Who said I'm leaving town?

39:22.235 --> 39:24.397
Well, you were detailed
to the Thorn case.

39:24.529 --> 39:27.237
- I was.
-And we closed that case.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.446
We did.

39:29.951 --> 39:31.362
And you have a duffel bag.

39:32.078 --> 39:33.614
| was headed to the gym.

39:34.956 --> 39:37.914
No, I've been posted full time
at the British Embassy,

39:38.042 --> 39:40.420
effective... immediately.

39:40.545 --> 39:41.751
What?!

39:43.798 --> 39:45.380
[laughs]

39:49.429 --> 39:51.420
[crickets chirping]

39:55.101 --> 39:56.307
[sighs]

39:59.188 --> 40:00.269
Hey.

40:00.398 --> 40:01.638
Hey, how is he?

40:01.983 --> 40:03.314
Not good.

40:04.152 --> 40:06.610
He just found out
his girlfriend was Mata Hari.

40:06.738 --> 40:09.776
- I just wish I knew what to say.
-There is nothing to say.

40:09.908 --> 40:12.821
You've just gotta be there for him,
which you are.

40:14.954 --> 40:16.456
You're there for all of us.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.081
And we're going to need you
right now.

40:20.209 --> 40:21.461
What is it?

40:22.587 --> 40:24.169
This came.

40:30.511 --> 40:33.173
You're being subpoenaed
by John Foerstel? For what?

40:33.306 --> 40:36.719
His last question to my mom was
about our trip to St. Lucia.

40:36.851 --> 40:39.513
Foerstel's found
a Saint Lucian bank account

40:39.646 --> 40:42.229
set up by Eric Little six months ago...

40:42.357 --> 40:43.597
in my name.

40:44.442 --> 40:47.651
Right before Icarus got
its latest government contract

40:47.779 --> 40:49.611
for a billion dollars.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.272
<i>Tom...</i>

40:53.034 --> 40:54.695
I'm being set up.

40:54.827 --> 40:55.988
We're all being set up!
