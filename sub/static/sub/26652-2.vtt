00:01.610 --> 00:03.655
- Previously
on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

00:03.699 --> 00:05.266
That's my mom.

00:05.309 --> 00:07.137
There's no loophole
where I can save my family

00:07.181 --> 00:08.443
and not screw up history.

00:08.486 --> 00:09.661
- I'm so sorry, Z.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.490
- What the hell
is going on here?

00:12.534 --> 00:14.275
- This is my dad, Hank.

00:14.318 --> 00:15.841
- Hello, John.

00:15.885 --> 00:17.669
- The knuckle bones
of a martyred saint--

00:17.713 --> 00:19.976
they act as a divining rod,
able to detect the presence

00:20.020 --> 00:22.152
of beings not belonging
to our world.

00:28.158 --> 00:30.465
- I sent that bastard
straight to hell, didn't I?

00:30.508 --> 00:32.510
- You need to be
a part of a team.

00:32.554 --> 00:35.687
- No, I would rather
bloody top myself

00:35.731 --> 00:37.167
than move in with you lot.

00:37.211 --> 00:40.257
People around me
get killed or far worse.

00:40.301 --> 00:42.825
Oh, bollocks.

00:44.305 --> 00:46.872
- How's our magical
upgrade going, Ray?

00:46.916 --> 00:48.526
- Almost done, I think.

00:48.570 --> 00:49.701
Though the they never covered

00:49.745 --> 00:51.312
how to interface
time seismographs

00:51.355 --> 00:54.184
and enchanted bones
in the Ivy U PhD program.

00:59.842 --> 01:01.713
Well, that should do it.

01:01.757 --> 01:05.717
My peers would say that science
and magic don't mix,

01:05.761 --> 01:08.329
but to them, I'd ask, "Have you
seen 'The Fifth Element'?"

01:08.372 --> 01:09.852
Right?

01:09.895 --> 01:12.724
- Ivy U sounds like
a real party school.

01:12.768 --> 01:14.074
- Oh, I hope this works.

01:14.117 --> 01:15.379
We need a way to pinpoint

01:15.423 --> 01:17.164
magical threats
on the timeline.

01:17.207 --> 01:19.862
I mean, who knows what kind
of creatures are out there

01:19.905 --> 01:21.690
wreaking havoc on history?

01:21.733 --> 01:23.344
- Like, uh, vampires.

01:23.387 --> 01:24.388
- Gremlins.

01:24.432 --> 01:26.303
- Aswangs.

01:26.347 --> 01:28.392
Cannibalistic Filipino
were-beasts

01:28.436 --> 01:31.178
with proboscis-like tongues.

01:31.221 --> 01:32.918
I've been doing some research
just in case.

01:32.962 --> 01:35.007
- I thought that's why
we had Constantine.

01:35.051 --> 01:37.358
- Yeah, about that.

01:37.401 --> 01:39.011
Constantine is...

01:39.055 --> 01:42.058
- Tired, hungover,
and in need of a stiff one.

01:43.799 --> 01:46.193
Dealer's choice as to what
that's a euphemism for.

01:46.236 --> 01:48.151
- He's here.

01:48.195 --> 01:50.806
- Yeah, you know, I meant what
I said about joining you lot,

01:50.849 --> 01:53.287
but then I pictured that
same lot squaring off against

01:53.330 --> 01:55.550
some of the manky buggers
that I've come up against,

01:55.593 --> 01:57.291
and I thought,
"Yeah, you know what?

01:57.334 --> 01:59.771
You're right. You're all bloody
doomed without me."

01:59.815 --> 02:03.166
One aswang will take you down
without breaking a sweat.

02:03.210 --> 02:05.255
- Ha ha!
New legend alert.

02:05.299 --> 02:06.909
I better go update
the chore wheel.

02:06.952 --> 02:08.606
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hang on, sunshine.

02:08.650 --> 02:10.173
I'm not a bloody legend.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.480
I'm merely offering my services
as a consultant,

02:12.523 --> 02:15.657
and as such,
I have some stipulations.

02:15.700 --> 02:17.485
I don't do silly costumes,

02:17.528 --> 02:19.269
I expect full benefits,

02:19.313 --> 02:22.838
and I require no less
than two weeks paid vacation.

02:28.670 --> 02:30.193
- Hey, it worked.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.806
We already got a--

02:34.850 --> 02:37.940
Do we have a special name
for these magical fugitives?

02:37.983 --> 02:39.855
- Well, I was thinking,
since they're mysteries

02:39.898 --> 02:41.813
involving mythical beings,

02:41.857 --> 02:46.427
we could go
with myth-teries.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.516
- Fugitives it is.

02:48.559 --> 02:49.821
What's it say?

02:49.865 --> 02:52.346
- Salem, Massachusetts,
1692.

02:52.389 --> 02:53.999
- First day on the job,

02:54.043 --> 02:55.697
and you're taking me
to the bloody witch trials.

02:55.740 --> 02:58.961
- Well, I hope you're
feeling morally superior

02:59.004 --> 03:00.963
because we are getting

03:01.006 --> 03:04.749
our Puritan purit-on.

03:06.011 --> 03:08.362
That was too much, right?

03:17.414 --> 03:19.242
- I'm telling you, your machine
is clearly buggered.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.897
There's nothing magical
about Puritan New England.

03:21.940 --> 03:24.204
- I know. I was there, but it
could all be different now.

03:24.247 --> 03:25.814
- Oh, come on.

03:25.857 --> 03:27.468
If a creature landed there,
why would it idle

03:27.511 --> 03:29.905
in the absolute worst
possible place for magic?

03:29.948 --> 03:31.863
The people of Salem
are paranoid and petty,

03:31.907 --> 03:33.909
and, besides,
every magical creature knows

03:33.952 --> 03:36.085
that if you want to get weird,
you go to New York.

03:36.128 --> 03:38.218
- Then we need to find it
before it flees.

03:38.261 --> 03:40.176
- All right, well, I agreed
to help you save history,

03:40.220 --> 03:42.918
not take part in your little
role-playing adventures.

03:42.961 --> 03:44.702
Call me if you find anything.

03:44.746 --> 03:46.182
- If he's staying,
I'm staying.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.229
Besides, no fun
in Puritan times.

03:49.272 --> 03:52.101
The Church banned
burning people at the stake.

03:52.144 --> 03:53.581
- Well, they didn't
actually burn people.

03:53.624 --> 03:55.322
That was the Middle Ages.

03:55.365 --> 03:58.499
The Puritans used the gallows,
but, yeah, sure, stay.

03:58.542 --> 04:00.283
- You know, I actually miss

04:00.327 --> 04:02.590
having someone
Nate-splain history to us.

04:02.633 --> 04:03.591
- Me too.

04:03.634 --> 04:05.288
- Speaking of which,

04:05.332 --> 04:07.769
I wonder how Operation
Dinner with Dad is going.

04:09.945 --> 04:13.296
- Thanks.

04:13.340 --> 04:15.777
- Good steak.

04:15.820 --> 04:18.997
So, um, what are you doing
for work these days?

04:20.434 --> 04:22.523

Little bit of that.

04:22.566 --> 04:23.611
You?

04:23.654 --> 04:25.177
- Same old, same old.

04:27.484 --> 04:30.270
- Sir, your credit card
was declined.

04:30.313 --> 04:31.880
- I, uh--

04:31.923 --> 04:34.622
I must have given you the...
wrong one.

04:34.665 --> 04:35.797
There you go.

04:35.840 --> 04:39.757
- And this one expired
in 1953.

04:39.801 --> 04:42.978

why I still carry it.

and we think it's a real witch.

09:16.947 --> 09:18.558

must be off her trolley

09:18.601 --> 09:20.342

why they call it that.

spontaneously combusted.

The whole town was set ablaze."
- Sounds like my kind of woman.

09:52.766 --> 09:54.506

to convince the public

- Whatever it is,
Jane's at the center of it.

09:57.901 --> 09:59.163
- Well, now, hang on a minute.

09:59.207 --> 10:00.469
You said that
she was gagged.

10:00.512 --> 10:01.949
- Yeah.

10:01.992 --> 10:06.388
- Did any of you actually
hear her cast a spell?

10:06.431 --> 10:08.042
You see, spells are

10:08.085 --> 10:09.609
a verbal game, mateys.

10:09.652 --> 10:10.871
Was there anyone else there,

10:10.914 --> 10:12.829
someone who would want
to protect Jane?

10:12.873 --> 10:14.831
- Prudence.
- Her daughter.

10:14.875 --> 10:17.878
- Ah, a malevolent demon has
attached itself to the child,

10:17.921 --> 10:19.140
and the mother is being blamed.

10:19.183 --> 10:21.185
I've seen it
a million times over.

10:21.229 --> 10:22.883
Easy peasy,
lemon squeezy.

10:22.926 --> 10:24.232
Let's get to it, shall we?

10:24.275 --> 10:27.452
- Well, look
who started to care.

10:27.496 --> 10:29.890
- Uh, but I am not
wearing a costume.

10:29.933 --> 10:31.413
I'll see you later, big man.

10:52.913 --> 10:55.611
Is that you?

10:55.655 --> 10:58.396
Did you sleepwalk
to work again?

10:58.440 --> 11:00.094
- Whoa, whoa!
- Oh, my God!

11:01.748 --> 11:03.880
What the hell
are you doing here?

11:03.924 --> 11:05.969
And why aren't you
wearing pants?

11:06.013 --> 11:07.710
- I can explain.

11:07.754 --> 11:10.582
And thank you for not
mentioning the shower cap.

11:10.626 --> 11:11.932
- Pretend I did.

11:11.975 --> 11:13.629
- Coconut oil
makes my hair more buoyant.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.717
- Mm-hmm.

11:14.761 --> 11:15.892
- I should try that.

11:15.936 --> 11:18.112
And, uh,
the pants situation?

11:18.155 --> 11:21.811
- Well, I decided
to extend my trip to 2018,

11:21.855 --> 11:25.032
and I may possibly be living
a little bit at the Bureau.

11:25.075 --> 11:26.729
- You couldn't spring
for a hotel?

11:26.773 --> 11:28.557
- Well, here's a fun fact
about staying in the present--

11:28.600 --> 11:31.299
it costs money,
and as a legend,

11:31.342 --> 11:35.085
your salary is the friendships
you make along the way.

11:35.129 --> 11:36.478
- Got ya.
- Yeah.

11:36.521 --> 11:39.699
And you? I know
you love paperwork, but...

11:39.742 --> 11:41.744
- Oh, yes,
I'm presenting my budget

11:41.788 --> 11:43.920
to the Department of Defense
tomorrow.

11:43.964 --> 11:45.530
Rip was always good
at schmoozing the bigwigs.

11:45.574 --> 11:47.054
It was never
really my thing.

11:47.097 --> 11:49.099
And now, with this whole
magic initiative,

11:49.143 --> 11:50.753
we're gonna need
even more money.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.537
- I can help.
I'm great at schmoozing.

11:52.581 --> 11:54.452
Oh, uh, no--
no, thank you.

11:54.496 --> 11:56.019
Why not?

11:56.063 --> 11:58.152
I need a place to stay.
You need a wingman.

11:58.195 --> 12:00.110
It'll be fun,
and we can hang out.

12:00.154 --> 12:01.503

ham and eggs.

17:50.591 --> 17:52.419
- Damn it.

17:52.462 --> 17:54.421
The godmother
was telling the truth.

17:54.464 --> 17:55.813
We can't send her to hell

17:55.857 --> 17:57.206
without sending Prudence
down with her.

17:57.250 --> 17:58.947
Bloody fairy godmothers--

17:58.990 --> 18:01.776
they're like parasites
who feed off their hosts.

at the whim of their charge.

18:03.908 --> 18:06.694
The girl will have
to reject the godmother.

18:06.737 --> 18:08.565
- Who's going to give up
that kind of power,

18:08.609 --> 18:11.220
especially
in her situation?

18:11.264 --> 18:14.136
- We just have to give her
what she wants.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.617
If we save her mom,
she won't need the godmother.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.662
- Z, we can't.

18:18.706 --> 18:20.577
I checked
the historical record.

18:20.621 --> 18:22.971
Jane Hawthorne
was executed as a witch.

18:23.014 --> 18:25.321
That was canon
before the fairy godmother

18:25.365 --> 18:26.583
affected the timeline.

18:26.627 --> 18:28.107
We can't change that.

18:28.150 --> 18:30.848
- So we're just gonna
let them do it?

18:30.892 --> 18:34.461
Sara, this is exactly what
it's like where I'm from--

18:34.504 --> 18:36.202
the tribalism,
scapegoating,

18:36.245 --> 18:38.465
persecuting someone
just because they're different,

18:38.508 --> 18:41.381
while other people just
stand by and do nothing.

18:41.424 --> 18:43.165
- I don't want it to go down
like this either, Z.

18:43.209 --> 18:44.993
I'm sorry,
but we don't have a choice.

18:45.036 --> 18:47.169
- Look, I promised her
that I would help her.

18:47.213 --> 18:49.650
- Well, you made a promise
that we can't keep.

18:49.693 --> 18:52.870
The priority here is separating
Prudence from her godmother.

18:52.914 --> 18:54.568
That's how we're gonna
save more lives.

18:54.611 --> 18:56.004
- So, in the meantime,

18:56.047 --> 18:57.571
we just let her think
we're saving her mom?

18:59.181 --> 19:01.314
- Great.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.806
- I'm here to save you, Jane.

19:15.850 --> 19:18.113
- We need to go now.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.420

but I cannot go.

19:30.908 --> 19:32.693
- These people are insane.

19:32.736 --> 19:34.303
They're gonna kill you
no matter what.

19:34.347 --> 19:35.739
- They are afraid,

19:35.783 --> 19:38.002
and fear brings out
the worst in all of us.

19:38.046 --> 19:40.962
Therefore,
I must forgive them...

19:41.005 --> 19:43.225
for they know not
what they do.

19:43.269 --> 19:45.184

of whom I think.

20:05.116 --> 20:07.467

20:07.510 --> 20:10.252

use her power henceforth.

23:45.554 --> 23:47.556

there was a time demon

23:50.472 --> 23:51.952

broke his prison,

23:56.739 --> 23:58.654
which, surprise, surprise,

23:58.698 --> 24:00.874
released an unknown number of
other dangerous magical beings,

24:00.917 --> 24:02.571
all of whom got spat out
across the timeline

24:02.615 --> 24:04.878
and now must be hunted down
and sent to hell.

24:06.706 --> 24:08.577

- No, actually.

24:10.536 --> 24:14.365

24:23.505 --> 24:25.072
The damage that these
supernatural fugitives

24:25.115 --> 24:26.726
