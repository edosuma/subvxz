WEBVTT

01:17.411 --> 01:19.004
The first date.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.961
<i>Sometimes all you have
is a couple of details.</i>

01:23.584 --> 01:27.214
<i>Red miniskirt, blond hair.</i>

01:27.379 --> 01:30.974
<i>But you never know who your client's
gonna be, or how they're going to look.</i>

01:31.133 --> 01:33.761
- Hi.
- Hi. Ahem.

01:33.927 --> 01:38.273
- How are you?
- I was like, no way. That can't be him.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.901
You look like a secret agent
in that suit.

01:41.059 --> 01:44.188
- Well, uh, ahem, don't blow my cover.
- Ha, ha.

01:44.354 --> 01:48.029
Come on, Mr. Breaker
I'm buying you a drink.

01:48.191 --> 01:52.867
- What did you just call me?
- Mr. Drecker.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.700
Mr. Breaker, it's Logan
Logan Lewis.

01:56.867 --> 02:00.167
I was in your history class.
World history.

02:00.621 --> 02:04.296
- You gave me a D, you jerk.
- Logan Lewis.

02:06.084 --> 02:08.836
- Sure, sure. Uh, hi.
- You forgot me.

02:09.003 --> 02:10.256
No.

02:10.422 --> 02:13.892
Mr. Drecker, I can't
believe you forgot me.

02:14.051 --> 02:17.021
- Ahem.
- You still drive that jeep?

02:17.387 --> 02:22.268
No, I, uh... I drive a convertible.

02:22.434 --> 02:23.981
- Nice.
- Yeah.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.689
Why don't I buy you a drink?

02:28.565 --> 02:32.320
- Uh, we shouldn't be doing this.
- Relax. I'm legal now.

02:32.486 --> 02:36.411
You know, I used to, um...
I used to stare at your hands.

02:36.573 --> 02:39.873
- I would be staring-
- No, no, I mean this.

02:41.328 --> 02:42.830
We shouldn't be doing this.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.624
- Why not?
- Because you know me.

02:45.791 --> 02:48.169
All right? And I know you.

02:48.335 --> 02:54.217
And you're a nice girl,
and you have a lot going for you.

02:54.383 --> 02:59.264
You shouldn't be paying for it.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.854
I'll tell you what,
I'll get your money back.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.563
Okay?

03:05.394 --> 03:07.567
What are you talking about?

03:10.107 --> 03:13.031
<i>And sometimes
you get it all wrong.</i>

03:15.570 --> 03:18.824
Anyway, it's great to see you.
I think you look great.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.118
And, uh, sorry about that D.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.412
- Heh.
- I've gotta go. See you.

03:26.498 --> 03:27.590
Hi.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.717
<i>Logan Lewis.</i>

03:29.876 --> 03:32.220
<i>Smart, talked a lot in class.</i>

03:32.379 --> 03:34.598
<i>What if she told somebody?</i>

03:34.756 --> 03:36.349
<i>"Paying for it."</i>

03:36.508 --> 03:38.431
<i>Of all the things to say.</i>

03:38.593 --> 03:41.267
All you told me was blond hair
and red miniskirt

03:41.430 --> 03:46.812
Tanya, from now on we need a file,
you know, with a photo or something.

03:46.977 --> 03:48.775
<i>Ray, we are not the FBI.</i>

03:48.937 --> 03:51.065
What woman is gonna let me
take her picture?

03:51.231 --> 03:52.983
I blew my cover, Tanya.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.494
I knew this girl from school.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.780
Wait, you had sex with a student?

03:57.946 --> 04:00.495
No, no, with a former student.

04:00.657 --> 04:04.912
- You had sex with a former student?
- No! We talked, Tanya.

04:05.078 --> 04:08.332
I thought that she was the client.

04:08.498 --> 04:11.047
And I... I mean...

04:11.209 --> 04:13.303
I should... I gotta call her, you know?

04:13.462 --> 04:15.430
- I should explain to her...
- No. No.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.762
- Do not call anyone.
- Fuck.

04:17.923 --> 04:22.270
What if she Facebooks or Twitters
or whatever the hell they do now?

04:22.429 --> 04:25.182
Do not call anyone, all right?
And I rescheduled Lydia.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.726
Lydia, yeah.
Uh, I don't know, you know?

04:29.811 --> 04:31.154
Please, no cuffs.

04:31.313 --> 04:35.034
The outfit, the handcuffs. I mean,
it's too much. It's not my thing.

04:35.192 --> 04:36.694
<i>Not your thing?</i>

04:36.860 --> 04:38.237
It needs to be your thing, Ray.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.247
Because if it's not your thing,
it's gonna be Jason's thing.

04:41.406 --> 04:42.703
<i>You need a safe word.</i>

04:42.866 --> 04:44.539
- A what? A what?
- A safe word.

04:44.701 --> 04:47.420
<i>It's something you say when
a situation gets out of hand.</i>

04:47.579 --> 04:49.707
Like "bubble boy" or "Chechnya"
or something.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.341
<i>So she knows to stop hurting you.</i>

04:51.500 --> 04:54.128
I don't need to say "bubble boy,"
Tanya, okay?

04:54.294 --> 04:57.173
I will figure this out myself.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.513
<i>Ray, hello?</i>

05:00.675 --> 05:02.177
<i>- Ray?
- Oh, no.</i>

05:02.344 --> 05:04.142
<i>Earth to Ray, hello?</i>

05:04.304 --> 05:08.229
- You guys, is this bad reception in here?
- "Catch up sometime"?

05:08.391 --> 05:09.938
<i>Ray?</i>

05:15.065 --> 05:16.738
Psst.

05:16.900 --> 05:20.074
A fat guy, an Arab and a baby
get on a plane...

05:20.237 --> 05:23.116
and they got two parachutes.
Who gets them?

05:23.698 --> 05:26.827
- Um, I don't...
- The parachute.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.463
- Boo!
- Oh, my God!

05:31.915 --> 05:35.545
That's nice. Okay.

05:36.378 --> 05:38.051
Come on, let's go.

05:43.093 --> 05:46.518
- Hi.
- Guess you changed your mind about me.

05:46.680 --> 05:50.435
Well, a pimp comes through for a pimp.

05:55.438 --> 05:56.906
Lenore?

05:57.065 --> 06:00.114
Shh! I'm in here.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.995
Give me your hand.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.295
What happened?

06:10.453 --> 06:14.549
I was punished for trying
to help someone.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.962
- I'm sorry.
- I'll be fine.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.550
Jason, listen to me.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.512
Their clients have heard of you
and they're calling me directly.

06:22.674 --> 06:25.723
I have three women lined up
for you this week alone.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.059
I sense hesitation.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.563
It's Sandee.
You know, she called.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.272
She's at her mom's.

06:33.435 --> 06:37.360
Sandee. She wants you back?

06:37.522 --> 06:39.650
She's pregnant.

06:40.609 --> 06:42.737
And it's mine.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.577
Where is her mother's house?

06:46.740 --> 06:48.583
Okay.

06:48.742 --> 06:52.121
Three, four... Okay.

06:52.287 --> 06:53.834
Hi, uh, Logan, it's Ray.

06:53.997 --> 06:56.546
I've been thinking about you.

06:56.708 --> 06:59.052
Just thought I'd say hi.

06:59.210 --> 07:02.009
<i>Hello?
- Hi, uh, Logan.</i>

07:02.172 --> 07:04.550
It's Mister... Uh, Ray.

07:04.716 --> 07:06.309
It's... it's Breaker.

07:06.468 --> 07:08.891
<i>Hi, Mr. Drecker.</i>

07:09.054 --> 07:10.476
Ahem. Hi.

07:10.639 --> 07:12.312
<i>Guess who I just talked to.</i>

07:12.474 --> 07:14.602
What? Uh, who?

07:14.768 --> 07:19.069
Andy Figler. I told her I ran into you
and she couldn't believe it either.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.527
Believe what?

07:20.690 --> 07:23.489
- That I ran into you.
- Oh, right.

07:23.652 --> 07:25.074
Um, ahem.

07:25.236 --> 07:30.288
Listen, uh, Logan,
the other night, um, you know...

07:30.450 --> 07:33.545
- ...I hope you didn't get the wrong idea.
- About what?

07:33.703 --> 07:39.426
You know, sometimes things can,
um, sound not the way they are...

07:39.584 --> 07:42.007
with all that music in that place.

07:42.170 --> 07:45.094
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- What?

07:46.007 --> 07:47.304
Do you want to come over?

07:47.968 --> 07:50.312
- To your house?
- Yeah.

07:50.470 --> 07:55.727
I'd love that. We could, um, catch up.
Why not?

07:58.812 --> 08:00.155
Lori usually gives the tours...

08:00.313 --> 08:02.816
but I figured you'd want
a friendly face to show you.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.782
Again, Matt, thank you so much
for the opportunity.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.446
Like I said, happy to help.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.831
You need a job and we need some help
at the office.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.913
And you'll fit right in. We all get along.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.828
- Hello.
- Little tip though.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.794
Bake something.
Kill them with chocolate.

08:18.498 --> 08:22.378
- Here we go, kitchen.
- Uh, ha, ha. Yeah, kitchen.

08:22.544 --> 08:23.966
Is this where I put my lunch?

08:24.129 --> 08:26.848
- Oh, brown bagging it, huh? Nice.
- Well.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.510
Tell you what.
Since it's your first day...

08:29.676 --> 08:32.099
how about I take you out
to Calico Dan's for lunch?

08:32.261 --> 08:34.481
Oh, you don't have to do that.
Thank you though.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.017
Yeah, you're right.
I should be tightening my belt too.

08:37.267 --> 08:39.770
Mindy's trying to bleed me dry. Heh.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.234
Divorce can do such
strange things to people.

08:42.397 --> 08:45.276
I had no idea that Ronnie
would be so angry.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.661
Oh, my God, Mindy is
like the Incredible Hulk.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.696
- Really? Ha, ha.
- Oh, yeah. Ha, ha.

08:49.863 --> 08:53.709
When he first told me about the hand job,
I was like, "Well, okay.â€œ

08:53.867 --> 08:56.541
Whoa, wait a minute.
What hand job? What?

08:57.454 --> 08:58.831
Huh?

08:58.997 --> 09:01.546
- My wife gave Ronnie a hand job?
- No.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.342
Rf icky

09:08.173 --> 09:10.426
I'm not upset, okay?

09:10.592 --> 09:12.936
Um, what would you say was
the timeline of that hand job?

09:13.094 --> 09:15.142
- When did it take place?
- Oh, I don't...

09:15.305 --> 09:17.854
- I'm not really sure, Matt.
- Just a guess.

09:18.016 --> 09:20.986
- I'm not really sure.
- Just a guess-timate.

09:39.662 --> 09:41.039
<i>Lydia.</i>

09:41.206 --> 09:44.130
<i>It was a ; if you ask me</i>

09:44.292 --> 09:47.717
<i>Some women like to dress up
as nurses, schoolgirls.</i>

09:47.879 --> 09:50.883
<i>What kind of woman
likes to dress up like a cop?</i>

09:51.049 --> 09:53.393
Good evening, officer.

09:53.551 --> 09:57.351
I suppose you think because you're
good-looking and I'm a woman...

09:57.514 --> 10:01.109
- ...that you can just get away with littering.
- Oh, no, I wasn't littering.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.895
- I think you did.
- Look, I don't want any trouble.

10:04.062 --> 10:08.863
Well, you have a choice.
You can go to jail or you can fuck me.

10:10.652 --> 10:13.826
Well, uh, I guess I'll go to jail.

10:20.036 --> 10:23.290
Bad idea. Now you have
to go to jail and fuck me.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.299
- Hands behind your back.
- Ow! Hold up, hold up.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.132
- What did you say?
- Chechnya! Bubble boy!

10:28.294 --> 10:30.717
- Timeout.
- What?

10:31.089 --> 10:34.343
Look, I think we need
a safe word, okay?

10:34.509 --> 10:36.261
You know, like, uh...

10:36.427 --> 10:39.101
I'm fine with letting you play
dress-up and all that stuff...

10:39.264 --> 10:42.234
but ease up on the whup-ass, please.

10:42.392 --> 10:43.985
Oh, God.

10:44.144 --> 10:48.445
- Was I too rough on you?
- No, I didn't say that.

10:48.606 --> 10:53.533
I just, you know...
it's for both of us.

10:53.695 --> 10:54.992
You know, just in case.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.829
- I mean, right?
- Okay.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.335
Okay, whatever you need.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.838
I mean, I don't need one, but if it
makes you feel more comfortable...

11:03.997 --> 11:07.752
Heh. What? I'm not the one
who needs one, believe me.

11:07.917 --> 11:11.592
- Well, who needs one then'?
- Well, I don't know.

11:11.754 --> 11:14.007
I was thinking of you.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.142
Oh, well.

11:16.301 --> 11:20.681
Don't you worry about me. Huh?

11:25.476 --> 11:28.480
It looks like a beeper. Does it beep?

11:28.646 --> 11:31.445
Yes, it beeps. Talks too.

11:31.608 --> 11:32.985
Really? What does it say?

11:33.151 --> 11:36.200
- You wanna hear?
- No, I can... It's okay.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.456
- No, I can hear it later.
- Hold on, hold on.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.743
- Oh, God, don't. Don't futz with it.
- Come on.

11:40.909 --> 11:42.707
I can make it speak Spanish for you.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.668
Relax. Fuck you.
Don't fuck with me, Charlie.

11:45.830 --> 11:49.084
I bailed you out. You are in my house.
You play by my rules.

11:49.250 --> 11:52.424
Now give me that fucking knife.
Give it to me.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.930
Thank you. You're in my custody.

11:58.092 --> 12:00.390
This is serious business.

12:03.681 --> 12:06.480
I mean it. No.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.450
Man, I like it when you
lay it down, warden.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.870
Tanya!

12:22.951 --> 12:25.545
Tanya? Skagle!

12:25.703 --> 12:27.125
Uh...

12:27.288 --> 12:30.542
Tanya!
- Ray, uh, just a second.

12:30.708 --> 12:31.960
- Ha, ha.
- Shh!

12:32.126 --> 12:34.504
- So you're gonna hide me from your ho?
- Shh! Hush.

12:34.671 --> 12:37.174
No. I got nothing to hide.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.217
Tanya!

12:40.301 --> 12:42.178
Tell him I said hi.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.267
Why are we talking out here?
Do you know?

12:47.433 --> 12:49.356
We're getting fresh air, all right?

12:49.519 --> 12:51.772
What? What's up?
What's up? What is it?

12:51.938 --> 12:54.566
Lydia, she's way too hyper.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.326
She's gonna kill me.
We need to bench her.

12:57.485 --> 13:00.785
Okay, 'fine. Fine, I'll do
it I'll do it. I just...

13:00.947 --> 13:03.120
I just don't think right now
is the best moment...

13:03.283 --> 13:05.661
- ...to bench a paying customer.
- Why not'!

13:05.827 --> 13:08.250
Because some of the women,
not all of them...

13:08.413 --> 13:10.632
not the ones I respect
the most, quite frankly...

13:10.790 --> 13:12.337
Spit it out.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.424
Some of the women think it's nice
to get fucked by a younger guy.

13:15.586 --> 13:16.678
They wanna try him out.

13:16.838 --> 13:19.466
I'm the old guy all of a sudden
just because this kid is 12?

13:19.632 --> 13:22.602
You're not old, you're just older.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.263
Let me tell you something, Skagle.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.853
I'm seeing a 25-year-old tonight.

13:28.016 --> 13:31.316
- What, like a potential client?
- No, like a date, okay?

13:31.477 --> 13:33.775
Women her age happen
to find me very appealing.

13:33.938 --> 13:37.568
Ray, that's pathetic.
There's lots of women over 35...

13:37.734 --> 13:38.906
Don't throw stones, Tanya.

13:39.068 --> 13:41.571
It's okay for you to fuck
some kid in a bathroom...

13:41.738 --> 13:43.957
but I go out on a date
with some younger girl...

13:44.115 --> 13:46.618
that makes me suddenly
a dirty old man? You're sexist.

13:46.784 --> 13:49.128
And my neighbor knows
I fucked some kid in a bathroom.

13:49.287 --> 13:51.460
Everybody knows you fucked
some kid in a bathroom.

13:51.622 --> 13:55.627
<i>- That is a tactical move and you know it.
- Tactical? Ha! My ass.</i>

13:57.086 --> 13:58.429
Matt, that's bullshit!

13:58.588 --> 14:01.216
Bullshit, Matt.
Where's your fucking proof?

14:01.382 --> 14:03.009
I know what happened, Mindy.

14:03.718 --> 14:06.312
Why, because she told you?
Did you tell him that?

14:06.471 --> 14:08.223
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

14:08.389 --> 14:11.518
- We were talking about Ronnie and...
- How could you hire her?

14:11.684 --> 14:13.436
We used to laugh about how
stupid she is.

14:13.603 --> 14:14.980
- Remember that?
- I do not.

14:15.146 --> 14:17.865
Absolutely not. Look, I don't know
what she's talking about.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.901
- Did you fuck her yet?
- What?

14:20.068 --> 14:22.571
- Did he fuck you yet? He will. He does that.
- Mindy.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.660
And you do that too, don't you?

14:24.822 --> 14:28.122
You have nothing to offer, so you
find someone who does and you glom on.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.286
I think this meeting has
come to an end, Mindy.

14:30.453 --> 14:32.876
I'm just trying to do my job.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.589
- Jessica.
- Please go away, Matt.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.554
<i>Jessica.</i>

14:43.716 --> 14:46.310
Uh, Patsy, could we get a minute?

14:46.469 --> 14:47.812
Thank you.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.684
Hey, I am so sorry that happened.

14:52.850 --> 14:56.525
She was way, way, way out of line.

14:56.687 --> 14:58.985
Is that what people think about me?

14:59.148 --> 15:03.745
God, no, not at all.
Hey, people really like you here.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.871
Yeah. They loved the cupcakes.

15:06.656 --> 15:09.159
You're a great filer.

15:12.495 --> 15:13.872
Excuse me.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.047
That's the ER. You know what?

15:19.460 --> 15:21.053
They can wait.

15:21.212 --> 15:23.055
This is more important.

15:25.133 --> 15:26.726
This is your house, huh?

15:26.884 --> 15:29.512
Yeah, my parents kind of gave it to me.

15:29.679 --> 15:33.855
It's funny, you know.
I never pictured you in the bar scene.

15:34.016 --> 15:37.566
Oh, no, I'm not, ahem, in the bar scene.

15:37.728 --> 15:40.356
So then who was that
that you were meeting?

15:40.523 --> 15:44.278
Yeah, I should probably explain
a little more about that.

15:44.444 --> 15:47.243
I, uh... I do a... Ahem.

15:47.989 --> 15:51.209
Uh, an outreach program.

15:51.993 --> 15:55.463
It's for this, uh, wellness center.
It's kind of like a support group.

15:55.621 --> 16:00.422
I get... You know, I raise money for it
and get paid sometimes to do counseling.

16:00.585 --> 16:05.967
Stuff like that. Anyway, the other night
I, heh, thought that you were...

16:06.132 --> 16:09.432
a patient... A client. Patient.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.976
I like your convertible.

16:14.515 --> 16:17.268
- Mr. Drecker, can I show you something?
- Sure.

16:17.435 --> 16:19.938
Okay. Um.

16:20.104 --> 16:26.578
This is probably gonna be stupid to you,
but it meant a lotto me.

16:26.736 --> 16:28.784
Okay, let's see. Oh, here.

16:28.946 --> 16:32.041
Oh, my God. There.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.248
- There.
- Was that me?

16:34.410 --> 16:39.257
- Mm-hm.
- "Logan, no matter who..." Heh.

16:39.415 --> 16:42.214
Jeez, I can't even read my handwriting.

16:42.376 --> 16:46.051
"Logan, no matter who
underestimates you...

16:46.214 --> 16:51.266
never underestimate yourself.
Coach D."

16:52.011 --> 16:55.811
- Well, that's...
- I fucking loved that.

16:58.476 --> 17:01.025
You know why
I gave you a D, don't you?

17:01.187 --> 17:03.986
Because it wouldn't have
been fair to the others?

17:04.815 --> 17:06.317
No. Heh.

17:06.483 --> 17:08.578
Because you didn't do the work.

17:11.821 --> 17:14.119
Are you a prostitute, Mr. Drecker?

17:16.035 --> 17:17.627
- What?
- How much do you cost?

17:17.787 --> 17:20.882
- Logan, wait. You got the wrong idea.
- That you fuck for money?

17:21.040 --> 17:24.214
- I told you. I'm a therapist.
- I'm pretty sure I got the right idea.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.881
- I raise money for...
- Mr. Drecker, I am not a little kid.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.800
Logan, I am your teacher.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.969
- Look...
- And I want to fuck you.

17:33.135 --> 17:35.308
I've gotta go.

17:35.471 --> 17:38.566
<i>- Lift it up.
- It makes my boobs look bigger.</i>

17:38.724 --> 17:40.647
<i>I'm very excited to show my friends.</i>

17:40.810 --> 17:43.484
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

17:43.646 --> 17:46.399
<i>- Check out my booty.
- Good God almighty, girl.</i>

17:49.110 --> 17:51.158
Mom.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.199
- Mom!
- Your mother can't hear you, Sandee.

17:55.241 --> 17:58.666
She's making a grocery run.
I just talked to her outside.

17:58.995 --> 18:01.464
- How did you find me?
- Jason gave me your address.

18:01.622 --> 18:03.090
Why?

18:11.716 --> 18:14.936
Congratulations, by the way...

18:15.094 --> 18:18.849
on your little bun, little miracle.

18:20.641 --> 18:23.520
- How many months are you?
- I don't know. Two maybe.

18:23.686 --> 18:26.030
- Are you taking your prenatal vitamins?
- Of course.

18:26.188 --> 18:28.532
- Let me see them.
- No.

18:28.691 --> 18:31.114
Oh, Sandee.

18:31.277 --> 18:34.497
Faking a pregnancy? Really?
Is that the best you could come up with?

18:34.655 --> 18:35.907
I'm not lying.

18:36.073 --> 18:39.623
Sweetheart, you entered a forest of lies,
and you forgot your fucking compass.

18:39.827 --> 18:42.455
But I think you and I have gotten off
on the wrong foot.

18:42.622 --> 18:46.297
Sandee, I don't want
to lake Jason away from you.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.212
- You don't?
- No, you two are meant for each other.

18:49.378 --> 18:52.222
You're meant to be together,
and I honor that.

18:52.381 --> 18:59.765
What I want is to sell Jason
to other women for a profit.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.604
Do you understand what that means?

19:04.435 --> 19:07.609
It's a terrific business
opportunity for him.

19:07.772 --> 19:11.822
Will you make it happen
or will you stand in his way?

19:12.526 --> 19:18.078
If I give you something I love,
what do I get in return?

19:18.240 --> 19:19.742
What do you want?

19:19.909 --> 19:25.712
I want a hi-def flat-screen TV
and Blu-ray.

19:29.543 --> 19:32.763
You're giving us your can'?
- What about the Mustang?

19:32.922 --> 19:36.267
You'll get the Mustang
too in about 10 years.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.769
This is safer, all right?

19:39.470 --> 19:41.973
Come on, guys. That's a great car.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.726
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.315
Thank you. And you.

19:47.478 --> 19:49.071
Uh...

19:49.230 --> 19:51.232
For you.

19:51.399 --> 19:52.867
Ta-da.

19:53.025 --> 19:56.746
It's a loan. Just a loan.

19:56.904 --> 19:59.032
Oh, Ray.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.621
- Thank you, Ray.
- Yup.

20:01.784 --> 20:05.163
GUYS, why don't you go
play your dad that song?

20:06.914 --> 20:08.006
Song? What song?

20:08.165 --> 20:10.384
Ray, thank you,
but I don't need the money.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.046
No, no, listen. Uh...

20:13.212 --> 20:15.055
You pay me back whenever you want.

20:15.214 --> 20:19.765
It's not that. I actually-
I don't need the money. I got a job.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.804
- Thank you.
- You got a job?

20:21.971 --> 20:25.601
Yeah, with the doctor
who treated my mom.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.564
You met him at the hospital.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.105
- The doctor?
- Yeah.

20:30.271 --> 20:32.694
- Okay.
- One, two, F-you.

20:33.023 --> 20:35.947
Congrats on your job

20:36.110 --> 20:38.488
<i>Don't F it up, don'! F it up</i>

20:39.029 --> 20:41.748
<i>Ronnie's gone</i>

20:41.907 --> 20:43.580
<i>Don't F it up, don'! F it up</i>

20:43.743 --> 20:45.837
<i>Jessica and yet another doctor.</i>

20:45.995 --> 20:48.874
<i>And the good news
just kept on coming.</i>

20:50.499 --> 20:52.922
Maybe I'm just shallow. I don't know.

20:53.085 --> 20:57.306
Louise, we have
a good thing going here.

20:57.465 --> 20:59.593
You're gonna throw it away?

20:59.759 --> 21:01.853
You don't even know this kid.

21:02.011 --> 21:05.265
I know, but I can only afford one of you.

21:05.431 --> 21:08.059
And, you know, he's...

21:09.393 --> 21:11.145
He's got a lot of energy.

21:18.527 --> 21:19.619
Hmm.

21:21.197 --> 21:23.325
Charlie, I'm home.

21:23.491 --> 21:25.118
Charlie?

21:35.294 --> 21:39.470
- Where's your milk? Where is it?
- Got some right here.

21:40.341 --> 21:42.514
You have 10 minutes, all right?

21:42.676 --> 21:46.931
You put this on, get in the car
and I'll drive you home.

21:47.097 --> 21:49.475
Ooh. â€œGet in the car."
Ha, ha.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.770
Who the fuck you talking to, Tanya?

21:51.936 --> 21:54.610
Who the fuck am I talking to?
I'm on the hook for 40 grand.

21:54.772 --> 21:57.321
You're breaking curfew.
I'm responsible for you.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.736
- Put it on.
- Put the bracelet down now.

21:59.902 --> 22:03.782
- I'm sorry?
- Put the damn bracelet out of sight.

22:03.948 --> 22:06.417
- Now.
- What's...?

22:13.707 --> 22:15.425
Oh, God.

22:16.669 --> 22:20.674
That's Lydia.
She's really a cop. She's a real cop.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.567
<i>So I lost a few clients.</i>

22:35.729 --> 22:38.653
<i>I still had a shoebox full of money.</i>

22:41.819 --> 22:44.493
<i>I didn't get it from being
a coach, a teacher...</i>

22:44.655 --> 22:46.749
<i>or a substitute teacher.</i>

22:46.907 --> 22:49.831
<i>I got it from the one job
I could count on.</i>

22:54.290 --> 22:56.634
<i>And I could outlast any kid.</i>

23:03.674 --> 23:07.724
Hey. What are you doing here?

23:07.887 --> 23:10.060
Uh...

23:11.557 --> 23:13.025
This thing that I do...

23:16.270 --> 23:19.444
- ...it's what I'm good at.
- Mm.

23:19.607 --> 23:22.486
Do you think I'm gonna tell on you,
Mr. Breaker?

23:22.651 --> 23:24.619
Give me a little credit.

23:24.778 --> 23:27.327
Well, I did give you that D.

23:32.328 --> 23:35.753
So then did you come here
to make it up to me?

23:37.333 --> 23:39.711
Heh. I don't know.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.467
Maybe.

23:43.172 --> 23:45.095
I want an A.

23:47.343 --> 23:52.144
- How about a C?
- I want an A.

24:00.272 --> 24:03.697
How about a B?
I want a fucking A, Mr. Breaker.

24:03.859 --> 24:05.987
And I want it now.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.707
You got 600 bucks?

24:36.767 --> 24:39.316
Oh, my Go-cl, Mr. Drecker

24:39.478 --> 24:41.606
I knew it.
