11:32.160 --> 11:34.479
You do whatever you gotta
do, whatever it takes.

11:34.480 --> 11:35.720
And second?

11:36.960 --> 11:39.839
Right, we're not people
'cause you don't have people.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.046
That's correct.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.764
Purpose for your
visit to Mexico?

11:45.920 --> 11:46.967
Quail hunting.

11:47.080 --> 11:49.811
My aunt in Tuba City had a heart
attack so we cut our trip short.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.119
Tuba City?

11:53.120 --> 11:54.326
It's near Odessa.

11:54.520 --> 11:55.719
Nice place?

11:55.720 --> 11:57.722
Hellhole,
but she's my favorite aunt.

STIG: Oh, shit.

12:03.760 --> 12:05.410
AGENT 1: Tell us about your trip.
Lawyer.

12:06.480 --> 12:07.679
What's the big deal?
Lawyer.

12:07.680 --> 12:09.648
You were down in Sonora,
weren't you?

12:12.840 --> 12:15.764
You don't think Agent Jessup and the
DEA know about you and Papi Greco?

12:15.880 --> 12:17.119
Lawyer. Lawyer.

12:17.120 --> 12:18.159
They know you were
at his ranch.

12:18.160 --> 12:19.321
I know I need a lawyer.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.650
AGENT 2: Tell Agent Rees
about Papi Greco.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.843
Who?
Papi Greco.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.845
Well, who's that? Some Mexican
Santa Claus or something?

DEB: (CHUCKLES)
Come on, Mr. Stigman.

12:30.840 --> 12:33.320
I think it's in your best
interest to cooperate.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.480
You need to stop playin'
the stupid card, all right?

12:36.680 --> 12:38.799
Well, ma'am, it's my intent to
cooperate with whatever you need.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.879
I mean, as an American, I know
you're just doin' your job,

12:40.880 --> 12:42.999
and sometimes innocent folks like
me get caught up in the system.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.519
It's like the airlines. They don't
lose your luggage on purpose, right?

12:45.520 --> 12:47.399
But everybody takes it
so damn personal.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.159
DEB: Come on, Mr. Stigman.
So you wanna play games?

12:50.160 --> 12:51.961
Well, what'd you have in mind?

12:52.480 --> 12:54.369

How do you concentrate
workin' with her, man?

13:21.320 --> 13:23.721
Five border agents are rippin'
apart your car as we speak.

No.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.251
Can they see us?
No.

13:36.440 --> 13:37.726
Okay.

13:38.720 --> 13:40.245
There was no cocaine.

13:44.080 --> 13:45.639
You had a deal in place.
Right.

13:45.640 --> 13:48.199
Five hundred passports
in return for cocaine.

13:48.200 --> 13:49.406
Right.

13:49.560 --> 13:50.879
Hey, Bobby.

13:50.880 --> 13:51.920
BOBBY: How you doin', Deb?

13:52.040 --> 13:55.249
Good. Man, your boy
Stig's a piece of work.

13:56.560 --> 13:57.925
He winked at you, didn't he?

13:59.160 --> 14:00.241
How'd you know?

14:00.920 --> 14:02.490
Bobby didn't get the cocaine.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.051
DEB: What?
What happened?

14:04.680 --> 14:07.399
Papi offered me cash.
I told him no.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.004
I told him
to keep the passports,

14:10.040 --> 14:12.159
so, eventually, he's gotta
come up with the cocaine.

14:12.160 --> 14:14.925
What about this guy you said
you could flip? Little Toro?

14:16.320 --> 14:18.288
I got him.
It's real close.

14:19.800 --> 14:21.723
I don't know
who you are anymore.

14:22.360 --> 14:23.646
It's like...

14:24.120 --> 14:25.884
It's like you're
out on this limb.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.162
And you've been out
there way too long.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.924

that to say what?

14:30.080 --> 14:31.684

You're dating...

Mmm-hmm.

15:32.680 --> 15:35.843
...your imaginary
boyfriend, Harvey.

15:36.200 --> 15:39.044
Uh, he's not my boyfriend,
and his name's not Harvey.

15:39.200 --> 15:42.329
I like Harvey. It has a
nice ring to it. Harvey.

15:42.480 --> 15:44.519
You don't get to be
jealous anymore, Bobby.

15:44.520 --> 15:45.726
Harvey.

15:46.360 --> 15:48.039
You pushed me away.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.565
So you could be with Harvey.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.250
Fuck you.

15:53.760 --> 15:55.171
Little Tom's dead.

15:56.280 --> 15:58.121
You told Jessup you were
close to flipping him.

15:58.320 --> 15:59.560
I was.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.599
But when I got
down to the ranch,

16:01.600 --> 16:03.762
Papi's boys was throwin'
his head around in a bag.

16:03.920 --> 16:05.604
Well, that's game, then.

16:06.040 --> 16:09.681
With Little Toro off the board,
Jessup's pulling you out.

16:09.840 --> 16:10.921
Not if you don't tell him.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.759
I'm your control, Bobby.
That's correct.

16:12.760 --> 16:13.761
I have to tell him.

16:13.880 --> 16:17.168
That's why I need you

16:17.600 --> 16:20.683
to let me rob
Tres Cruces Savings and Loan.

16:20.880 --> 16:21.927
You want to rob a bank?

16:22.040 --> 16:24.281
No, Stig wants to rob
the bank. It's his idea.

16:24.440 --> 16:25.726
So there's no entrapment.

16:25.920 --> 16:28.399
What I want
is access to that money

16:28.400 --> 16:30.448
that Papi's got
in the safe deposit box.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.159
You know no judge
is gonna give you

16:32.160 --> 16:33.730
a blanket warrant
for the boxes.

16:33.920 --> 16:36.764
We don't need a warrant. Not if
the money's evidence in a crime.

16:36.920 --> 16:38.319
We just trace it
back to ownership,

16:38.320 --> 16:41.164
we got Papi on tax evasion,
possible RICO.

16:41.720 --> 16:43.051
Yeah?
Yeah.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.359
And what about Stig?

16:44.360 --> 16:45.441
What about him?

16:45.680 --> 16:46.841
He's a side dish.

hadn't welched on that coke.

you get everybody

No, I don't.

I mean, this can't
be Papi's money.

28:46.280 --> 28:48.681
In your hand. Is that
a badge in your hand?

in the place.

across from a diner

a coincidence,

looking hard enough.

Bobby Beans was DEA?

31:28.440 --> 31:29.441
No, I didn't.

No offense, sir, but you really need
to work on your surprised face.

31:32.760 --> 31:35.570
Well, if he was DEA,
he helped you rob a bank.

31:36.320 --> 31:38.800
Which means he's dirty, and
for that, I have no mercy.

31:40.600 --> 31:42.568
Where'd you leave him?
In the desert.

31:42.720 --> 31:44.768
Is he dead?
More than likely.

31:47.480 --> 31:48.970
"More than likely."

31:50.400 --> 31:51.765

what that means?

31:52.040 --> 31:54.159
The whole point of you
working with Bobby Beans

31:54.160 --> 31:55.519
was to kill him off
and create a cut-out

31:55.520 --> 31:57.159
so the op couldn't
get traced back to us.

31:57.160 --> 31:59.119
My cover's solid. There's
no way it'll trace back.

My cover is solid. There's no
way it'll trace back, sir.

above your pay grade.

32:05.680 --> 32:06.727

money in the same bank as the CIA?

deliver to Tres Cruces

7% of my revenue.

me use their planes

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.481
No shit?

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:12.840
Yeah.
What was she doin' there?

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:15.040
She said she was there to
meet her boyfriend, Harvey.

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:17.199
Wait. Your girlfriend
has a boyfriend?

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.531
She's not my girlfriend.

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:20.601
Holy shit.

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:23.566
Yeah, just pick a car.

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:25.486
Right here.

01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:27.281
You picked that one?

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:28.401
Yeah.

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.804
Fuck you want,
a fuckin' Bentley?

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.406
I got it.

01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:51.484
WOMAN: Hi.
Hey.

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:53.931
Crazy question,

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.851
you wouldn't have anybody knows
how to fix a snowmobile?

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.001
I don't think so.

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:00.519
Would you check for me? I really
need it fixed by tonight.

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:01.931
Why, a big storm coming?

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:03.969
You never can be too sure.

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:06.241
I'll be right back.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.525
Up with that?
What?

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:11.648
She smiled at you,
you didn't wink at her?

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:13.723
I don't wink
at every woman I see.

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:17.487
Snowmobile in Texas, huh? You must
be in some serious shit, sailor.

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:19.000
You got yourself
a new claw, huh?

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:21.242
Gimme claw. Give it a pound.
It's a beaut.

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:23.164
You still got
my rainy-day stash?

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:24.446
Yeah.

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:29.771
See ya later, Stig.

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:31.041
All right.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.439
STIG: You know what they say, talk softly
and carry an M-4 with a grenade launcher.

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:38.726
BOBBY: Wow.

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:41.451
Which one you want?

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.880
This one.

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:44.724
What's your plan
for gettin' on the base?

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.087
I'm workin' on it.

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:02.599
Remember, once we get
to the command building,

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.279
Quince's office is first
floor, end of the hall.

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:06.439
If he's not in the field, that's
where he lives 18 hours a day.

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:07.885
Right, right. But you
still haven't told me

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.639
what the plan is to
get through the gate.

01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:12.166
I got a plan. I mean, I'm capable
of comin' up with a plan.

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:13.359
I'm not sayin'
you're not capable,

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.771
I'm just sayin' you haven't told me.
What is it?

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:16.370

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:18.846

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.119
That was your plan?

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:56.319
Well, we're on the base,
aren't we?

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:59.279
That's not a plan. Nobody in their
right mind breaks into a naval base.

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:01.039
That's why it's a brilliant plan.
No one expected it.

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:04.079
You shoulda seen your face.
Damn, they were surprised.

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.719
Your stop comin' up.
I'll play decoy,

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:07.319
lead 'em away, try to get
to the Admiral, okay?

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.926
All right. Things go wrong, I'll
see you back at the boat yard.

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:11.201
Things ain't goin' wrong.

Admiral, I'm gettin' a medal. Watch.

01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:18.120
You're gonna wish
me luck, aren't ya?

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:19.799

Good luck.

Shit, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to do that to you, man.

Sir. (PANTING)

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:56.327
I've been in service 12 years.

01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:58.639
I've never stepped foot in an
officers' mess, much less crashed it.

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.130
Please, sir, it's an emergency.

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.325
Stand outside, please.

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:06.368
Leave us alone.
Thank you, sir.

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:07.919
Hey, I'm really sorry
about that, man.

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:10.239
I didn't mean to hit you like that.
I apologize.

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:12.599
I'm listening,
sailor. Sit.

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:13.806
Thank you, sir.

01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:21.040
QUINCE: Try the Admiral again for me.
RECEPTIONIST: Yes, sir.

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:38.919
ADMIRAL: And you believed
this stolen money

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:41.844
would all be used
to fight drug cartels?

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.731
Yes, sir. I thought the orders came
down the valid chain of command.

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:46.763
Blind loyalty is not loyalty.

01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:48.600
I know that, sir,
and that's why I'm here.

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:50.799
Well, you've shown
a lot of tenacity

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:52.450
and a lot of guts
bringing this to me.

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:54.802
Thank you, sir. That means
the world comin' from you.

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:59.530
Unfortunately, there's
nothing I can do for you.

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:01.959
Of course, sir. I mean, you
can just lock down the base.

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:03.200
You can arrest
Commander Quince.

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:06.204
The United States Navy
does not rob banks.

01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:08.362
Its personnel
did not rob a bank.

01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:12.167
I'm not gonna tarnish the integrity
of the Navy over one crooked sailor.

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:13.999
If there was money
taken from the bank

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.970
that was part of
an illegal CIA slush fund,

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:19.600
the Navy had no knowledge
the fund existed.

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:24.039
Your jacket has you
six months AWOL?

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.041
Yes, sir.

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:27.129
It's gonna stay that way.

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:33.410
Commander Quince's jacket will
likewise be amended so he's also AWOL,

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.847
making none of this
the Navy's problem.

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:38.208
Sir, this isn't right.

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:40.044
Well, I'd offer more,

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:41.679
but when the hand has gangrene,

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:43.682
you chop it off
to save the body.

01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:48.331
You don't keep the pinkie around
just because it meant well.

01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:00.720
Have Petty Officer Stigman
dropped outside the main gate.

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:04.811
He sets foot on a military
base anywhere in the world,

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:07.530
I want him shot.

01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:08.879
This is bullshit.

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:11.201

on the orders of men like you!

like they did Jessup?

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:47.959
STIG: Well, you know
what was so cool?

01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:49.919
You rolling in
on that '64 Impala.

01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:51.519
I mean, you looked badass, man.

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:52.759
BOBBY: Yeah,
that's right.

01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:54.999
Listen, one more thing,
one more thing.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.081
STIG: What?

01:38:56.200 --> 01:38:57.440
BOBBY: Give me your gun.

01:38:58.080 --> 01:38:59.479
Give me your gun.

01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:00.559
STIG: You're not serious.

01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:01.561
BOBBY: Yes, I am.

01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:02.921
Thank you.

01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:05.119
You're really gonna do this after
everything we've been through?

01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:07.079
Arm or leg?

01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:08.679
This is not gonna
make you feel better.

01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:11.719
I'm thinking leg. Because leg, there's
more flesh, there's not as much bone.

01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:12.999
The arm will...

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.559
You know what you are?
You are a petty...

01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:17.086
(GUNSHOT)
Fucking son of a bitch!

01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:19.119
Hurts, doesn't it? You
know you coulda killed me?

01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:21.119
Is that right? Three
more inches to the left.

01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:22.199
Don't even say it, man.

01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:23.679
You wouldn't be winking
at waitresses anymore.

01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:25.719
I'd still wink, I just wouldn't
be able to do anything about it.

01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:26.919
You know me, I don't miss.

01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:29.599
I never miss. When's the
last time you saw me miss?

01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:32.251
You gonna carry my ass
all the way the fuck home.

01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:34.283
Oh, shit, man.
This burns.

01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:35.771
BOBBY: (CHUCKLES)
That's correct.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.839
STIG: You know, I shot you when
I didn't know who you were.

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:41.319
Before we were family.

01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:42.399
There's a difference.

01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:44.767
BOBBY: But we're family now. I shot
you because I know who you are.

01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:46.086
STIG: That ain't right.

01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:05.804
They definitely got the look.

01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:09.760
Assholes and windshield sunglasses,
practically CIA uniform.

01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:11.765
Can I get you boys
anything else?

01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:14.086
Are your doughnuts any good?

01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:17.566
Tell you the truth,
they're pretty lousy.

01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:19.882
Can't tell you how happy
we are to hear that.

01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:23.126
You take care.

01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:24.479
I saw that.

01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:25.959
Saw what?
You winked.

01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:27.530
That's a twitch.
Yeah, right.

01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:34.599
You know, for a guy who
just blew up $43 million,

01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:36.719
all of a sudden, you are
a very generous tipper.

01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:39.007
Who said I blew up $43 million?

01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:41.919
What are you sayin'?

01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:43.239
I'm not sayin' anything.
What are you hearing?

01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:45.239
I'm hearin' somethin'.
You're sayin' somethin'.

01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:47.279
Well, if you're hearin' it, it's
only because you're hearin' it,

01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:49.799
not 'cause I'm sayin' it.

01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:51.290
How much did you keep?

01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:53.486
Two million?

01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:56.159
That's like one each.

01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:57.479
So now you get half?

01:40:57.480 --> 01:40:59.608
Well, I shot half the guys. So?

01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:02.211
Two million?

01:41:03.305 --> 01:41:09.628
