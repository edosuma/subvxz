Semper fortis.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.026
Mom, you said if I came
over, we could watch a movie.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.059
No. I said if you
finished your homework.

00:29.060 --> 00:30.560
But Latin's too hard.

00:30.561 --> 00:33.233
I know, I know. But I swear,
you will use it for everything.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.565
Really. Especially if you
want to be a doctor or a lawyer.

00:35.566 --> 00:37.107
I don't want to
be either of those.

00:37.108 --> 00:39.038
Okay. What do you want to be?

00:39.039 --> 00:40.571
A fashion designer.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.043
Semper fortis.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.476
Always... something.

00:46.477 --> 00:48.518
(Knock on door) Oh.
Must be your father.

00:48.519 --> 00:50.221
Already?

00:54.054 --> 00:54.825
Hey.

00:54.826 --> 00:56.186
Hello, Todd.

00:56.187 --> 00:58.158
Thanks for watching
her. Anytime.

00:58.159 --> 01:00.260
Come on, kiddo. Let's go.

01:00.261 --> 01:02.763
See you, Megan.

01:05.666 --> 01:06.796
Thanks, mom.

01:06.797 --> 01:08.668
I'm sorry about the movie.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.470
Maybe we can do it this weekend.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.673
I can't. I'm going to
Boston with dad and Kate.

01:14.545 --> 01:17.076
Oh.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.349
Well, then, um...

01:19.350 --> 01:20.850
Next weekend.

01:20.851 --> 01:22.413
Okay.

01:30.191 --> 01:33.123
Let me get this straight.
This tall? You're sure?

01:33.124 --> 01:35.325
Man, she took a real beating.

01:35.326 --> 01:38.228
Then some soulless
bastard dumps her out here.

01:38.229 --> 01:40.230
Well, that's if she was dumped.

01:40.231 --> 01:43.203
A guy walking his dog
came across the body

01:43.204 --> 01:44.374
and Mr. Meth head over there

01:44.375 --> 01:45.735
going through her pockets.
What do you want me to say?!

01:45.736 --> 01:46.736
Hey, settle down.

01:46.737 --> 01:49.839
Liver temp and rigor puts t.O.D.

01:49.840 --> 01:51.881
Between 5:00 and
7:00 P.M. yesterday.

01:51.882 --> 01:54.644
No obvious fatal trauma.

01:54.645 --> 01:57.517
No strangulation.
No stab wounds.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.249
Ooh.

01:59.250 --> 02:01.891
Nice compound fracture
of the tibia, though.

02:01.892 --> 02:04.254
How hard would you have
to hit someone to do that?

02:04.255 --> 02:06.196
Never underestimate
the power of meth.

02:06.197 --> 02:08.858
Detective Morris,
good to see you.

02:08.859 --> 02:12.402
Dr. Hunt. Nice tennis
shoes. Very c.S.A.

02:12.403 --> 02:15.265
(Man shouts indistinctly,
camera shutter clicks)

02:15.266 --> 02:17.167
Crime scene
appropriate. (Chuckles)

02:17.168 --> 02:19.169
You get an I.D.
On this girl yet?

02:19.170 --> 02:22.342
No. My newfound friend dookie over
here isn't gonna... (Speaking indistinctly)

02:22.343 --> 02:24.614
Tell us anything till he
lands back on planet earth.

02:24.615 --> 02:26.616
Well, this looks like it
could be a handprint.

02:26.617 --> 02:29.749
I'm thinking she and dookie
came out here to get high.

02:29.750 --> 02:33.423
He tries to take
advantage. She fights back.

02:33.424 --> 02:36.486
Mm. I don't think this girl
presents as a drug user.

02:36.487 --> 02:40.190
Well, it's what's on the inside
that counts, right, doctor?

02:40.191 --> 02:43.162
(Chuckles) I'll let you know
what I get out of rocket man.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.163
(Camera shutter clicks)

02:44.164 --> 02:46.896

02:46.897 --> 02:49.269
(Police radio
chatter, siren wails)

02:49.270 --> 02:51.271
Bud was almost in a good mood.

02:51.272 --> 02:53.172
His wife let him
back in the house. Ah.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.205
What is with those shoes anyway?

02:55.206 --> 02:56.506
I'm not wearing heels. So?

02:56.507 --> 02:58.208
Well, that's a first.

02:58.209 --> 03:00.610
Maybe my mind
was on other things.

03:00.611 --> 03:01.951
(Sighs)

03:01.952 --> 03:04.454
Lacey is going to
Boston this weekend...

03:04.455 --> 03:05.915
With Todd and Kate.

03:05.916 --> 03:07.917
Ah. He didn't even consult me.

03:07.918 --> 03:09.919
A whole weekend
with his new girlfriend,

03:09.920 --> 03:12.492
who, by the way, just
also happens to be my...

03:12.493 --> 03:14.193
Your boss.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.795
(Indistinct conversations,
camera shutters click)

03:15.796 --> 03:17.797
Good morning, Dr. Murphy.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.329
I understand we've
got a dumped body.

03:19.330 --> 03:21.271
We're not sure if it
was dumped or not.

03:21.272 --> 03:23.273
Great. This area's
supposed to be family friendly.

03:23.274 --> 03:24.974
I already have the city
tourist board calling me.

03:24.975 --> 03:26.276
And here I was,

03:26.277 --> 03:27.877
concerned about a woman
who was beaten to death. Hmm.

03:27.878 --> 03:30.440
You know that
for a fact? Not yet.

03:30.441 --> 03:31.811
Well, until you
do, I'm consulting.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.543
Send me the x-rays as
soon as you have 'em.

03:33.544 --> 03:36.386
(Camera shutters clicking)

03:36.387 --> 03:37.747
Go, team.

03:37.748 --> 03:40.250
(Kate) Okay, folks, I
have a brief statement.

03:40.251 --> 03:42.492
The body of a woman
was found this morning.

03:42.493 --> 03:44.425
We have no I.D. At this time.

03:45.896 --> 03:47.797
(Morris) Who was she, dookie?

03:47.798 --> 03:50.700
I don't know who she is.

03:50.701 --> 03:52.231
I already told you.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.403
Who was she?

03:53.404 --> 03:55.965
(Sighs) I don't know.

03:55.966 --> 03:58.268
I don't know! I don't
know! I don't know!

03:58.269 --> 04:00.840
Knock it off. Knock
it off. Knock it off!

04:00.841 --> 04:02.772
You know what I think?

04:02.773 --> 04:05.345
I think you two
were getting high.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.447
Things got out of hand.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.779
You dragged her off the path
into those godforsaken woods.

04:09.780 --> 04:12.282
You took her money,
and you beat her to death.

04:12.283 --> 04:14.554
No! I told you, when I tripped

04:14.555 --> 04:18.388
is when I first saw her body, but
she was dead already. (Pounds table)

04:18.389 --> 04:19.990
Is that before or
after you shot up?

04:25.596 --> 04:27.897
Jane Doe, approximately
30 years old.

04:27.898 --> 04:30.300
No obvious cause of death.

04:30.301 --> 04:32.342
Severe abrasions
on the right side.

04:32.343 --> 04:35.305
Compound fracture
of the left tibia.

04:35.306 --> 04:37.677
How big was the guy who did
this? (Camera shutter clicking)

04:37.678 --> 04:40.680
If it's the guy from the
scene, about Ethan's size

04:40.681 --> 04:42.712
with the added bonus of meth.

04:42.713 --> 04:45.355
Uh, meth gives you
superhuman strength.

04:45.356 --> 04:46.317
It does not make you stronger.

04:46.318 --> 04:47.717
It just makes you
feel like you are.

04:47.718 --> 04:50.289
It blocks the brain's
pain receptors

04:50.290 --> 04:53.623
so the muscles
operate beyond fatigue.

04:53.624 --> 04:56.626
(Clicks) And she has a tattoo

04:56.627 --> 05:00.330
on her left wrist
of four horses.

05:00.331 --> 05:01.401
Of the apocalypse?

05:01.402 --> 05:03.433
Four little horses, and
you go apocalypse?

05:03.434 --> 05:05.805
Well, horses are scary,
and there's four of 'em.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.378
Those don't look like
badass, scary horses to me.

05:08.379 --> 05:09.679
Those are nice horses.

05:09.680 --> 05:10.940
Horses are never nice.

05:10.941 --> 05:12.442
If you don't mind,

05:12.443 --> 05:13.883
there is something
written beneath the horses.

05:13.884 --> 05:16.646
"Pa-1302." (click)

05:16.647 --> 05:18.317
Ah. Thank you.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.319
And she has glitter
on her lips. Hmm.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.492
Presumably from her lipstick.

05:22.493 --> 05:24.354
Are you sure she wasn't a user?

05:24.355 --> 05:25.955
There's no evidence
of xerostomia.

05:25.956 --> 05:28.498
Why? There's white
powder under her nails.

05:28.499 --> 05:30.400
Is that cocaine?

05:30.401 --> 05:32.462
Huh. Maybe bud was right,

05:32.463 --> 05:34.904
and our victim and her attacker
were doing drugs together.

05:34.905 --> 05:36.966
Or not. (Camera shutter clicks)

05:36.967 --> 05:39.409
Forensics found a
d.N.A. Match in codis

05:39.410 --> 05:40.870
to the bloody handprint.

05:40.871 --> 05:43.373
We have a new suspect, sort of.

05:43.374 --> 05:44.814
Sort of? (Click)

05:44.815 --> 05:48.648
Zoe brant. She's doing
four to seven years in county.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.380
How do you kill someone

05:50.381 --> 05:54.053
if you're already behind bars?

05:54.054 --> 05:55.555
(Fabric snaps)

♪♪♪

06:02.833 --> 06:04.063
(Morris) Zoe brant...

06:04.064 --> 06:06.135
Serving four to seven
for nearly beating

06:06.136 --> 06:07.097
your drug dealer to death.

06:07.098 --> 06:09.599
But good behavior got
you, uh, horse therapy

06:09.600 --> 06:12.371
at grass hill stables
two days a week.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.073
Yeah, so?

(Indistinct conversations)

06:20.080 --> 06:22.712
Oh, my god. That's Bryn.

06:22.713 --> 06:25.685
Does Bryn have a last name?

06:25.686 --> 06:26.856
(Slides picture)

06:26.857 --> 06:30.860
Yeah. Bryn Walker.
She started the program.

06:30.861 --> 06:32.462
What happened to her?

06:32.463 --> 06:35.625
You tell us. That's
your blood on her shirt.

06:35.626 --> 06:37.797
Wait. You think I did
this? I got cut yesterday.

06:37.798 --> 06:40.970
A horse kicked me to the
ground. Bryn helped me up.

06:40.971 --> 06:43.072
That part of the therapy,
getting knocked to the ground?

06:43.073 --> 06:45.104
(Scoffs) Bryn used
horses to help us learn

06:45.105 --> 06:48.538
how to control our emotions,
how to be more sensitive.

06:48.539 --> 06:50.540
And what emotions do you think

06:50.541 --> 06:52.882
made that horse want
to kick you in the head?

06:52.883 --> 06:55.184
Uh, pain. I was
bandaging the horse's leg.

06:55.185 --> 06:58.147
Uh, Bryn was teaching me
to be a veterinary assistant.

06:58.148 --> 07:00.149
Wow. That's a long road.

07:00.150 --> 07:02.652
I'm out in three months.
I've got a little girl,

07:02.653 --> 07:05.154
and I want to be able
to take care of her.

07:05.155 --> 07:07.156
What's your little girl's name?

07:07.157 --> 07:08.728
None of your business.

07:08.729 --> 07:12.532
Wow. That horse therapy's
really working for you, Zoe.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.864
We'll be in touch.

07:14.865 --> 07:16.466
(Woman) Let's go.

07:16.467 --> 07:18.968
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

07:18.969 --> 07:22.071
So much for good behavior.
Five will get you ten that, uh,

07:22.072 --> 07:24.073
Zoe tried to escape,
Bryn got in the way.

07:24.074 --> 07:26.746
Why would she escape?
She's out in three months.

07:26.747 --> 07:28.748
'Cause she's a felon and a user.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.580
You saw those track marks.

07:30.581 --> 07:32.882
Yeah, I saw them. They were old.

07:32.883 --> 07:35.124
It may be hard for you
to comprehend, detective,

07:35.125 --> 07:38.227
but users do get clean.

07:38.228 --> 07:40.229
People can change.
Bryn Walker believed that.

07:40.230 --> 07:42.231
Maybe, but she wouldn't
be the first person

07:42.232 --> 07:45.995
who got killed by giving
a felon a second chance.

07:45.996 --> 07:49.198
(Megan) Anything on those
x-rays to give us cause of death?

07:49.199 --> 07:51.240
(Kate) Not found yet.

07:51.241 --> 07:54.103
These injuries are all remote.
Maybe a couple of years old.

07:54.104 --> 07:56.245
Shattered her right
ankle, broken clavicle,

07:56.246 --> 07:57.807
broke her arm a couple of times.

07:57.808 --> 07:59.078
Those are riding injuries
she must have competed.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.480
That would be an understatement.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.482
Bryn was a champion equestrian.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.155
She won a competition
just a few days ago.

08:06.156 --> 08:08.958
And I think I've solved the
mystery about her tattoo.

08:08.959 --> 08:10.960
The only family she has
was her brother, Andrew.

08:10.961 --> 08:12.021
He died in prison.

08:12.022 --> 08:15.765
Pa-1302 was his
prison I.D. Number.

08:15.766 --> 08:17.767
If you can't save
the ones you love,

08:17.768 --> 08:20.069
save everyone else. What
about the four horses?

08:20.070 --> 08:22.572
Of the apocalypse, right?
What is it with you guys?

08:22.573 --> 08:24.574
It's the fourhorsemen
of the apocalypse,

08:24.575 --> 08:26.105
not the horses.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.107
I also got the blood tox back.

08:28.108 --> 08:31.140
Uh, Bryn wasn't a recent
user, and she didn't o.D.

08:31.141 --> 08:32.141
And we still don't have an I.D.

08:32.142 --> 08:33.683
Of that white
powder from her nails.

08:33.684 --> 08:35.144
(Scoffs) There is
no way this woman

08:35.145 --> 08:36.746
met up with a meth
head to get high.

08:36.747 --> 08:39.248
Is there anything besides
the blood to implicate Zoe?

08:39.249 --> 08:41.851
Not unless she picked
Bryn up by the foot

08:41.852 --> 08:43.152
and swung her around.

08:43.153 --> 08:44.924
Tib-fib spiral fractures.

08:44.925 --> 08:47.256
Usually you see this
around machinery accidents,

08:47.257 --> 08:49.258
like if a limb gets stuck
in something and twisted.

08:49.259 --> 08:50.630
There was no machinery
around the crime scene.

08:50.631 --> 08:51.801
You know what?

08:51.802 --> 08:53.803
Spiral fractures,
contusions on one side...

08:53.804 --> 08:56.236
I think that Bryn got her
foot caught in her stirrup.

08:59.169 --> 09:02.311
She was dragged by a horse.

09:02.312 --> 09:05.044
(People speaking indistinctly)

09:05.045 --> 09:06.545
A riding accident?

09:06.546 --> 09:08.547
No, I find that hard to believe.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.580
And why is that, Mr. Brooks?

09:10.581 --> 09:12.081
Ms. Walker was a pro.

09:12.082 --> 09:14.584
Did she often ride
without a helmet?

09:14.585 --> 09:17.156
Nope, but I only
manage this place.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.858
But I can tell you,

09:18.859 --> 09:20.860
she only rode one
horse, and there he is,

09:20.861 --> 09:22.862
no worse for wear.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.934
First class champion. (Neighs)

09:24.935 --> 09:27.867
Shh. Ooh, it's
okay. It's all right.

09:27.868 --> 09:31.240
Well, I don't see any
saddle marks or sweat stains.

09:31.241 --> 09:33.202
This horse hasn't
been ridden in a while.

09:33.203 --> 09:34.644
You know horses?

09:34.645 --> 09:36.606
I used to ride. My
daughter has the bug now.

09:36.607 --> 09:39.609
Really? 'Cause i... I
buy and sell on the side

09:39.610 --> 09:41.110
if you're ever in the
market. (Horse neighs)

09:41.111 --> 09:43.983
Bryn had a tattoo
with four horses.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.885
Sure she doesn't
ride any other horse?

09:45.886 --> 09:47.286
Not that I know of.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.288
Well, thank you very much
for your time, Mr. Brooks.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.061
No problem.

09:52.262 --> 09:55.094
You know, if you're
ever in the market.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.265
(Laughs)

09:56.266 --> 09:59.198
Did you see the way this horse
flinched when he touched him?

09:59.199 --> 10:00.269
So?

10:00.270 --> 10:01.171
So Zoe's right.

10:01.172 --> 10:03.202
Horses are very
sensitive to people.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.704
One false move...

10:04.705 --> 10:07.106
So we're still looking for
the horse Bryn fell off of.

10:07.107 --> 10:10.109
I'll make some calls,
see if anybody in Philly

10:10.110 --> 10:13.182
has a missing horse
in their backyard.

10:13.183 --> 10:15.114
(Nickers)

10:15.115 --> 10:16.616
Shh.

10:18.148 --> 10:20.820
(Man speaking indistinctly)

10:20.821 --> 10:21.991
(Lacey) Hello.

10:21.992 --> 10:24.253
Lace, hi. It's me.

10:24.254 --> 10:26.696
What are you doing later?

10:26.697 --> 10:28.397
The lower half of both
Bryn's lungs collapsed.

10:28.398 --> 10:30.299
Megan hasn't sectioned them yet?

10:30.300 --> 10:31.931
She set aside the
lungs for Ethan.

10:31.932 --> 10:34.233
Well, Ethan's not here, and
Megan's still at the stable,

10:34.234 --> 10:35.935
so I'll do it.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.937
Well, we still don't have c.O.D.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.839
Hand me the scissors.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.340
(Cart rattles)

10:41.341 --> 10:43.173
Thanks.

10:49.079 --> 10:50.319
What?

10:50.320 --> 10:53.022
First you're consulting,
and now you're dissecting?

10:53.023 --> 10:56.956
Mnh-mnh. You're
never this helpful.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.357
(Sighs)

10:58.358 --> 11:03.262
Todd and I are taking Lacey
to Boston for the weekend.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.394
Oh.

11:05.395 --> 11:08.397
Well, being helpful
isn't gon' help.

11:08.398 --> 11:10.340
Thanks.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.373
Wait. What is that?

11:14.374 --> 11:16.176
(Scissors clatter)

11:17.277 --> 11:19.909
Mm.

11:19.910 --> 11:22.281
What is that? Mm.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.283
Looks like some kind
of undigested food.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.686
How'd that get in her lungs?

11:29.019 --> 11:30.990
(Pants) Why are we doing this?

11:30.991 --> 11:32.762
Megan thinks that
Bryn falling off a horse

11:32.763 --> 11:34.193
had something to
do with her death.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.694
It would help to
find some evidence

11:35.695 --> 11:37.096
that she was
actually riding one.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.999
This is definitelynot
in my job description.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.272
You and me both, Sundance.

11:43.273 --> 11:45.204
Hey.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.006
I got hoofprints here.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.839
Oh. I've got crap.

11:49.840 --> 11:51.841
Well, keep looking.

11:51.842 --> 11:54.884
No, seriously. I've got crap.

11:54.885 --> 11:57.287
Okay.

12:01.091 --> 12:02.721
Is that...

12:02.722 --> 12:04.754
Yep. Manure.

12:04.755 --> 12:06.425
Horse was definitely here.

12:06.426 --> 12:09.959
We're done.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.331
You know, horses
give me the creeps.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.834
It all goes back to my
childhood, when I was younger,

12:14.835 --> 12:16.836
and my... my gramps
wouldn't let us watch cartoons.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.838
We would have to watch
reruns of "mister ed,"

12:18.839 --> 12:20.840
you know, with his lips
and his teeth moving.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.371
It was like a nightmare.

12:22.372 --> 12:23.813
Hey, Ethan. Huh?

12:23.814 --> 12:26.176
I think we found our horse.

12:31.251 --> 12:34.353
Wow. This riding vest
inflates when you fall.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.355
Look, it's got a drawstring.
You attach it to the saddle,

12:36.356 --> 12:38.187
and then when you
fall off the horse...

12:38.188 --> 12:40.189
I thought we were
shopping for my trip.

12:40.190 --> 12:42.862
Why would we need
to shop for your trip?

12:42.863 --> 12:45.034
What kind of trip
is this? A lame one.

12:45.035 --> 12:46.435
You don't want to go?

12:46.436 --> 12:48.397
Emily's birthday is on Saturday,
and she's having a huge party.

12:48.398 --> 12:50.399
But instead, I get
to be the third wheel

12:50.400 --> 12:51.770
with dad and Kate.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.302
Does your father
know about this?

12:53.303 --> 12:55.204
He doesn't care.

12:55.205 --> 12:58.447
Maybe you could talk to him?

12:58.448 --> 13:00.779
Maybe you could wear this vest?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.781
Mom, I know what
I'm doing on a horse.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.784
Lacey, a woman fell off her
horse yesterday and died.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.287
She was a very good rider,
but her foot still got caught

13:08.288 --> 13:11.060
in the stirrup. You're getting
this vest. I don't see how her foot

13:11.061 --> 13:12.491
could've gotten
caught in her stirrup...

13:12.492 --> 13:14.163
Lacey.

13:14.164 --> 13:16.125
Becausemost riders I
know... (Slides mouse)

13:16.126 --> 13:19.298
Use saddles with safety
stirrups. (Clicks mouse button)

13:19.299 --> 13:20.529
See, when you fall,
the sidebar detaches,

13:20.530 --> 13:23.472
and your foot comes out.

13:23.473 --> 13:26.806
(People speaking indistinctly)

13:30.140 --> 13:31.440
(People speaking indistinctly)

13:31.441 --> 13:33.442
Hey, Ethan and
I found this horse

13:33.443 --> 13:35.144
out by the crime scene.

13:35.145 --> 13:37.146
Bryn's name is on the saddle.

13:37.147 --> 13:39.118
Where's Ethan? Uh, therapy.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.420
What is going on,
Dr. Hunt? (Horse neighs)

13:41.421 --> 13:44.453
Detective Morris, this
is my daughter, Lacey.

13:44.454 --> 13:46.455
What the hell? Is this bring
your daughter to work day?

13:46.456 --> 13:48.958
Watch your language.
She's only 12.

13:48.959 --> 13:51.000
I'm almost 12 1/2.

13:51.001 --> 13:52.461
Mr. Brooks,

13:52.462 --> 13:55.134
it appears that Bryn
rode more than one horse.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.136
Uh, it must be
one of the misfits

13:57.137 --> 13:59.468
she used with her prisoners.

13:59.469 --> 14:03.242
Mm. Lacey, you're up.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.414
(Snorts) Whoa.

14:05.415 --> 14:07.416
It's okay. It's okay.

14:07.417 --> 14:10.419
These kind of saddles are
made with safety stirrups.

14:10.420 --> 14:12.421
See, if you fall, and
your foot gets caught,

14:12.422 --> 14:15.084
you don't get dragged
'cause it releases...

14:15.085 --> 14:16.385
(Grunts)

14:16.386 --> 14:19.990
But this one is broken.

14:24.494 --> 14:28.137
See, it's supposed
to release like this.

14:28.138 --> 14:29.969
(Clicks)

14:29.970 --> 14:33.342
Uh, maybe it got
stuck in the accident.

14:33.343 --> 14:36.345
Oh, right. Horse
did it all by himself.

14:36.346 --> 14:37.947
(Peter) This isn't broken.

14:37.948 --> 14:39.949
These scratches
look like tool marks.

14:39.950 --> 14:43.082
Someone's tampered
with this stirrup.

14:43.083 --> 14:46.356
Bryn's saddle was sabotaged.

14:55.926 --> 14:57.226
This is, uh, Bryn's
storage shed.

14:57.227 --> 14:59.898
Well, open it.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.270
(Jangles keys)

15:01.271 --> 15:04.233
Excuse me. Will,
what are you doing?

15:04.234 --> 15:06.635
This is police business, sir.

15:06.636 --> 15:08.007
This is private property.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.278
You don't go in there
without Bryn's permission.

15:09.279 --> 15:10.310
Bryn's dead.

15:11.581 --> 15:13.413
What?

15:17.187 --> 15:20.089
James savage.

15:20.090 --> 15:21.550
He's Bryn's boyfriend.

15:21.551 --> 15:23.552
(Lowered voice) Keep
him busy for a while.

15:23.553 --> 15:25.554
I want to see
what's in that shed.

15:25.555 --> 15:27.057
Sure.

15:29.699 --> 15:32.201
Mr. Savage...

15:32.202 --> 15:35.264
I'm very sorry that you
had to find out this way.

15:35.265 --> 15:37.266
How long were you
and Bryn together?

15:37.267 --> 15:39.668
(Horse neighs) About a year.

15:39.669 --> 15:41.670
We, uh, met at a competition.

15:41.671 --> 15:44.043
(Sighs) Just moved in together.

15:44.044 --> 15:47.216
Why didn't you call the police
when Bryn didn't come home?

15:47.217 --> 15:48.217
She was here at the stable.

15:48.218 --> 15:49.678
Overnight?

15:49.679 --> 15:52.051
Yeah. There's a
couch in the office.

15:52.052 --> 15:54.023
Sometimes she would stay
there if she had to work late.

15:54.024 --> 15:56.725
The prisoner program
required a ton of paperwork.

15:56.726 --> 15:58.227
Did Bryn ever mention

15:58.228 --> 15:59.328
having a fight with one
of the other prisoners?

15:59.329 --> 16:00.489
No, why?

16:00.490 --> 16:03.132
It seems somebody
sabotaged her saddle.

16:03.133 --> 16:06.066
Anyone else at the stable
have a problem with Bryn?

16:08.538 --> 16:12.001
Yeah. It's that creep
who works here.

16:12.002 --> 16:13.002
Will Brooks?

16:13.003 --> 16:14.743
Yeah. He made
some passes at her.

16:14.744 --> 16:16.705
He... he wouldn't let her alone.

16:16.706 --> 16:19.509
(Horse neighs)

16:32.222 --> 16:34.123
(Object clatters)

16:34.124 --> 16:36.165
Where's my mom? Crap.

16:36.166 --> 16:39.598
Don't sneak up on
people with guns, kid.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.430
Didn't your mom tell
you to wait in the car?

16:41.431 --> 16:43.272
Didn't she tell you to
watch your language?

16:43.273 --> 16:45.104
All right. Go do what she said.

16:45.105 --> 16:48.207
You do what she said.
You do what she said.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.140
(Laughs)

16:54.084 --> 16:57.146
You have no idea what
that stuff is, do you?

16:57.147 --> 16:59.348
I'll figure it out.

16:59.349 --> 17:02.151
It's a hoof pick.

17:02.152 --> 17:04.153
Cleans their feet.

17:04.154 --> 17:06.126
(Objects clatter)

17:08.228 --> 17:11.400
Wow. Look at these ribbons.

17:11.401 --> 17:12.561
Do you know what it takes

17:12.562 --> 17:14.303
to be this kind of
a champion rider?

17:14.304 --> 17:16.535
A horse, for starters?

17:16.536 --> 17:19.138
It's all about discipline
and awareness,

17:19.139 --> 17:20.639
of yourself and your horse.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.471
It's a lot about
communication...

17:22.472 --> 17:25.174
When to take control and
when to ease up on the reins.

17:25.175 --> 17:26.815
Oh, listen to you. A mini Megan.

17:26.816 --> 17:28.817
You don't like my
mom much, do you?

17:28.818 --> 17:30.649
Oh, I like her fine.

17:30.650 --> 17:34.523
She's like liver. Six days
a week is a little much.

17:34.524 --> 17:37.257
I wouldn't know.

17:39.289 --> 17:41.130
(Horse neighs)

17:41.131 --> 17:43.492
These look all right to you?

17:43.493 --> 17:45.294
Yeah.

17:45.295 --> 17:48.297
Your mom's looking
for you back at the car.

17:48.298 --> 17:51.340
Hey. You find anything
out from our friend?

17:51.341 --> 17:53.602
Well, it seems that will
Brooks may have wanted

17:53.603 --> 17:55.774
a little bit more than just
the keys to Bryn's shed,

17:55.775 --> 17:57.776
if you know what I mean.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.149
I don't get it.

18:00.750 --> 18:02.651
Uh... ask your mom.

18:02.652 --> 18:04.153
Yeah. I don't mean sex.

18:04.154 --> 18:05.854
I mean, how does an expert rider

18:05.855 --> 18:07.357
fall off her horse?

18:17.297 --> 18:19.798
I understand you
have Bryn's file.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.301
Yeah. I-I might have
a lead on her c.O.D.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.703
I found a piece of
broccoli in her right lung

18:24.704 --> 18:26.705
that was macerated
with stomach juices.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.437
You did? Yes, I know. Sorry.

18:28.438 --> 18:30.809
It's your body, but
you were at the stable,

18:30.810 --> 18:33.442
and Ethan was not here. Why
are you taking Lacey to Boston?

18:33.443 --> 18:36.145
I am not taking her
anywhere. Todd is.

18:36.146 --> 18:37.316
With you.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.448
Megan, I'm not
trying to replace you.

18:39.449 --> 18:41.490
Could I have the file, please?

18:41.491 --> 18:43.493
(Sighs)

18:47.597 --> 18:49.298
So I just won't go,
then. Yes, you will.

18:49.299 --> 18:51.160
Megan... her heart is normal.

18:51.161 --> 18:52.901
(Sighs) Blood work, too.

18:52.902 --> 18:57.206
So how did the contents of
her stomach end up in her lungs?

18:57.207 --> 18:59.308
A blow to the abdomen?
Maybe the fall off the horse?

18:59.309 --> 19:02.271
Yes, but what made
her fall off the horse...

19:02.272 --> 19:04.273
And cause food
to get in her lungs

19:04.274 --> 19:07.916
and both lower
lobes to collapse?

19:07.917 --> 19:09.918
It has to be a drug.

19:09.919 --> 19:11.880
But you said yourself,
her blood work was normal.

19:11.881 --> 19:13.323
Tox screen's don't
catch everything.

19:16.256 --> 19:18.587
If there is...

19:18.588 --> 19:21.260
An injection site,

19:21.261 --> 19:24.263
it would have to be
in the abraded area.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.935
Otherwise, we
would've found it earlier.

19:26.936 --> 19:30.299
Maybe someplace
where she didn't feel it.

19:30.300 --> 19:31.641
The soft tissue. Her hip.

19:40.650 --> 19:43.282
There is a bump here.

19:43.283 --> 19:46.255
There has to be an entry point.

19:46.256 --> 19:47.817
(Object clatters)

19:53.593 --> 19:54.763
Mm-hmm.

19:54.764 --> 19:56.366
Hmm.

20:04.904 --> 20:08.677
(Indistinct conversations)

20:08.678 --> 20:10.410
(Kate) Todd.

20:12.482 --> 20:14.283
You took Lacey to a crime scene?

20:14.284 --> 20:16.245
I think he's here to see me.

20:16.246 --> 20:18.647
I'm sorry. I'm... i'm... Just...
just give me one minute.

20:18.648 --> 20:20.950
Yeah. I'll take the
sample to the lab.

20:22.422 --> 20:25.394
Okay, I'll...

20:25.395 --> 20:29.928
Lacey calls me talking about...
About sabotaged saddles

20:29.929 --> 20:32.461
and... and dead horse riders.

20:32.462 --> 20:34.403
Where is she, by the way?

20:34.404 --> 20:35.734
In my office doing homework.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.235
Any killers in there?

20:37.236 --> 20:39.368
(Scoffs) At least I'm not
taking her away for the weekend

20:39.369 --> 20:40.539
with my new girlfriend.

20:40.540 --> 20:42.010
Why are you doing that?

20:42.011 --> 20:44.242
She has heart set
on going to that party.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.844
Yeah, that party is
being chaperoned

20:45.845 --> 20:47.816
by Emily's brother,
by the way. He's 17.

20:47.817 --> 20:50.449
Which I would've known if I
had any say in my daughter's life.

20:50.450 --> 20:51.650
You gave that up five years ago.

20:51.651 --> 20:52.951
I didn't give up
being her mother.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.023
Why don't you just let her
stay with me this weekend?

20:55.024 --> 20:58.427
No. No way. I'm
taking her home, megs.

20:58.428 --> 20:59.788
(Sighs)

20:59.789 --> 21:03.031
Uh, results on the powder
under Bryn's fingernails...

21:03.032 --> 21:06.495
Traces of oat bran and
sugar and phenylbutazone,

21:06.496 --> 21:07.996
also known as...

21:07.997 --> 21:10.969
Bute. It's a-a
horse pain reliever.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.401
It's...

21:12.402 --> 21:14.703
It, um...

21:14.704 --> 21:15.774
It sounds like she put it

21:15.775 --> 21:16.845
in some kind of mash
to feed the horse.

21:16.846 --> 21:18.377
Uh, that's not all.

21:18.378 --> 21:19.408
You know, uh, that
jumping competition

21:19.409 --> 21:20.649
she won a few days ago?

21:20.650 --> 21:21.850
A horse was disqualified

21:21.851 --> 21:23.382
for having too much
bute in its system.

21:23.383 --> 21:24.383
Whose horse?

21:24.384 --> 21:25.384
(Closes folder)

21:25.385 --> 21:27.386
The boyfriend... James savage.

21:27.387 --> 21:29.388
You think that
she buted his horse

21:29.389 --> 21:30.889
to get him disqualified?

21:30.890 --> 21:33.363
Well, maybe Bryn's not as
squeaky clean as we thought.

21:41.931 --> 21:43.932
You and Bryn were rivals.

21:43.933 --> 21:46.735
See, I didn't know that,
uh, horseback riding was

21:46.736 --> 21:48.036
the only olympic competition

21:48.037 --> 21:50.078
where men and women
competed equally.

21:50.079 --> 21:51.940
And she has been
kicking your ass.

21:51.941 --> 21:55.514
You've come in second ten
times in the last two years to her...

21:55.515 --> 21:57.686
The privvy invitational,
grosspoint grand,

21:57.687 --> 21:59.348
east coast summit.

21:59.349 --> 22:01.850
She drugs your horse.
You get disqualified.

22:01.851 --> 22:03.822
She ends up dead.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.624
I didn't kill Bryn.
That is absurd.

22:05.625 --> 22:08.927
Detective, do you know
why you're only allowed

22:08.928 --> 22:11.930
to give a small amount
of bute for a competition?

22:11.931 --> 22:14.403
No, doctor. Why?

22:14.404 --> 22:16.805
Because if it needs bute,
that means it's injured.

22:16.806 --> 22:19.368
And making a horse
compete like that

22:19.369 --> 22:21.039
would be inhumane.

22:21.040 --> 22:24.042
Mr. Savage, we both know
Bryn was not the kind of person

22:24.043 --> 22:26.575
to bute a horse
before a competition.

22:26.576 --> 22:28.116
Bute is administered orally.

22:28.117 --> 22:31.951
If it gets on your hands,
it can cause skin irritation.

22:32.982 --> 22:35.023
You buted your own
horse, didn't you?

22:35.024 --> 22:37.926
The only thing I ever put on
my horse during competition

22:37.927 --> 22:39.428
was coat shine.

22:39.429 --> 22:41.761
I make it myself,
and it's legal.

22:46.596 --> 22:48.967
Let's see. Show me your hands.

22:48.968 --> 22:51.140
Why? I'm gonna
test you for bute.

22:53.743 --> 22:55.874
Don't you need a
warrant? (Morris) Sure.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.877
And when we get one,
we'll have one for your trailer

22:58.878 --> 23:02.781
and your car, your
house, your computer.

23:02.782 --> 23:05.555
Anything on there you
don't want us to find?

23:07.487 --> 23:09.888
(Sighs)

23:09.889 --> 23:13.061
Okay. I buted my own horse.

23:13.062 --> 23:15.093
We're all looking for an edge.

23:15.094 --> 23:16.866
But I didn't kill Bryn.

23:20.129 --> 23:22.130
What I don't get
is if pagliacci here

23:22.131 --> 23:25.173
buted his own horse, then
why is it on Bryn's hand?

23:25.174 --> 23:27.105
Did you find any in the shed?

23:27.106 --> 23:29.137
No. Then again, why don't
you ask your daughter?

23:29.138 --> 23:31.079
She's like you. She's
a know-it-all, too.

23:31.080 --> 23:33.442
She should've stayed in the car.

23:33.443 --> 23:34.613
I think she just misses you.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.044
Why?

23:36.045 --> 23:37.746
What?

23:37.747 --> 23:39.087
Did she say something?

23:39.088 --> 23:42.420
Look, I... I don't
know kids. I just...

23:42.421 --> 23:45.423
She seems like she wants to spend
more time with you. (Cell phone beeps)

23:45.424 --> 23:47.426
I told her she was nuts.

23:48.828 --> 23:50.128
What is it?

23:50.129 --> 23:52.130
Preliminary lab report.

23:52.131 --> 23:55.003
Bryn was injected with
Succinylcholine bromide.

23:55.004 --> 23:57.135
A little slower please.

23:57.136 --> 24:00.008
It's a paralytic that vets
use to put horses down.

24:00.009 --> 24:01.970
Ah. Now we're back to Zoe.

24:01.971 --> 24:04.973
She was training to be
a veterinary's assistant.

24:04.974 --> 24:06.214
To provide for her daughter.

24:06.215 --> 24:08.076
(Sighs) I'll send some
guys out to the stables

24:08.077 --> 24:10.979
and see if there's a veterinary
kit with some missing, uh...

24:10.980 --> 24:12.581
Succinylcholine bromide.

24:12.582 --> 24:16.084
Why would she kill Bryn?
She was trying to help Zoe.

24:16.085 --> 24:18.557
Why? Look at your own evidence.

24:18.558 --> 24:20.559
The drug, the
blood on Bryn's shirt,

24:20.560 --> 24:22.190
access to the saddle...

24:22.191 --> 24:23.992
All roads lead to Zoe.

24:23.993 --> 24:26.895
You're the one who's always
talking about the body as proof.

24:26.896 --> 24:28.998
What is it telling
you? (Exhales)

24:30.640 --> 24:34.102
Asphyxiation by Succinylcholine.

24:34.103 --> 24:36.575
That's what killed Bryn.

24:36.576 --> 24:37.906
There's a vial missing,

24:37.907 --> 24:39.477
and your fingerprints
are all over that box.

24:39.478 --> 24:42.080
Outgoing phone records
from the stable office.

24:42.081 --> 24:44.112
Somebody was
calling your family.

24:44.113 --> 24:46.114
Bryn caught you using
the phone, didn't she?

24:46.115 --> 24:47.886
Threatened to take
away your privileges,

24:47.887 --> 24:49.888
bounce you out of the program...
That's not what happened.

24:49.889 --> 24:52.120
A guard saw you arguing
with Bryn outside the office

24:52.121 --> 24:54.122
an hour before she was killed.

24:54.123 --> 24:56.925
We were arguing because I
wanted her to stop calling my mother.

24:56.926 --> 24:58.927
Bryn was making
those calls? Yeah.

24:58.928 --> 25:01.169
She was trying to convince
my mom to let my kid see me.

25:01.170 --> 25:02.200
Why would that make you angry?

25:02.201 --> 25:04.232
My mom gave up on
me a long time ago.

25:04.233 --> 25:06.134
I appreciate what
Bryn was trying to do,

25:06.135 --> 25:08.106
but you can't convince
someone you've changed

25:08.107 --> 25:09.878
if they don't
want to believe it.

25:09.879 --> 25:12.841
(People speaking indistinctly)

25:12.842 --> 25:14.843
Why are your
fingerprints on the box?

25:14.844 --> 25:17.816
Bryn asked me to put
that box back in the cabinet.

25:17.817 --> 25:19.818
She'd just stopped someone
from trying to put a horse down.

25:19.819 --> 25:20.919
Who? I don't know.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.250
Some guy who
doesn't like horses.

25:22.251 --> 25:24.623
She, uh, she
wouldn't say anymore.

25:24.624 --> 25:26.595
Uh-huh. And this, uh, this
horse, what did it look like?

25:26.596 --> 25:28.827
I don't know. It
was a white one.

25:28.828 --> 25:30.829
It, uh, it was
new to the stable,

25:30.830 --> 25:33.302
had an injured front leg.

25:35.104 --> 25:37.706
You're sure the horse was white?

25:37.707 --> 25:39.108
Yeah.

25:43.743 --> 25:46.615
(Indistinct conversations)

25:46.616 --> 25:48.216
Excuse me, detective.

25:48.217 --> 25:50.749
Uh, I'm Zoe brant's mother.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.821
You wanted to speak to me.

25:52.822 --> 25:54.122
Oh, yes. Thanks for coming in.

25:54.123 --> 25:56.124
Uh... who is this?

25:56.125 --> 25:58.056
This is Zoe's daughter, Laila.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.058
Hi. Hi.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.761
That's pretty.

26:02.762 --> 26:04.833
(Velcro crackles)

26:04.834 --> 26:08.937
No, sweetie. Um, Laila,
come... come by grandma.

26:08.938 --> 26:10.939
Thank you.

26:10.940 --> 26:13.942
Um... Mrs. Brant, have
you ever talked to a woman

26:13.943 --> 26:16.175
named Bryn Walker?

26:19.248 --> 26:21.951
(Ethan) What were you eating?

26:23.212 --> 26:25.754
Man, this is weird.

26:25.755 --> 26:27.255
It looks like the horse digested

26:27.256 --> 26:29.257
some kind of metallic substance.

26:29.258 --> 26:30.759
What is that smell?

26:30.760 --> 26:33.121
Well, I just spent an
hour with the white horse

26:33.122 --> 26:35.624
trying to figure out why
someone would want to kill him.

26:35.625 --> 26:37.926
And, uh, I'm now
knee-deep in horse poop.

26:37.927 --> 26:39.227
Maybe it's the horse poop.

26:39.228 --> 26:40.729
Did you find anything
apart from metal in his...

26:40.730 --> 26:43.231
Yeah, he was sick with colic.

26:43.232 --> 26:45.704
And I found bute in his
whiskers mixed in with oat bran...

26:45.705 --> 26:46.875
Oat bran and sugar.

26:46.876 --> 26:48.136
Yes.

26:48.137 --> 26:49.938
So Bryn was taking
care of a sick horse.

26:49.939 --> 26:51.309
But that doesn't explain

26:51.310 --> 26:53.642
why she was riding a
horse she didn't own.

26:53.643 --> 26:55.644
Those are the
horse's veterinary files.

26:55.645 --> 26:58.346
I found a brand on the horse
and then tracked down the owner.

26:58.347 --> 27:01.119
Any connection to Bryn?
Mm-hmm. Will Brooks.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.291
The guy bought
the horse from him,

27:03.292 --> 27:06.295
and then returned it
because it didn't perform well.

27:08.297 --> 27:11.129
This horse was
supposed to compete?

27:11.130 --> 27:13.262
Mm-hmm.

27:18.938 --> 27:22.240
You were a little, um,
hard on Megan yesterday,

27:22.241 --> 27:23.742
don't you think?

27:23.743 --> 27:26.675
Yeah. Sorry to get
you involved in all that.

27:26.676 --> 27:28.146
You kinda crossed that line

27:28.147 --> 27:30.849
when you invited Lacey to
spend the weekend with us.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.851
See, you didn't know
the old Megan, okay?

27:32.852 --> 27:35.223
She wasn't always
this attentive.

27:35.224 --> 27:36.885
So she's changed. Yeah.

27:36.886 --> 27:39.227
Maybe she deserves a break.

27:39.228 --> 27:40.729
Whose side are you on?

27:40.730 --> 27:42.731
Ours. Listen...

27:42.732 --> 27:44.833
We are great together.

27:44.834 --> 27:45.994
True.

27:45.995 --> 27:47.096
But this isn't about us.

27:49.238 --> 27:52.170
I think maybe you invited
Lacey for the weekend

27:52.171 --> 27:55.974
because... you're
afraid of letting go.

27:55.975 --> 27:59.207
No, no. Uh, you
don't understand.

27:59.208 --> 28:01.179
My parents were divorced.

28:01.180 --> 28:04.182
I know what it's like to
be stuck in the middle.

28:04.183 --> 28:06.284
(Cell phone rings) Sorry.

28:06.285 --> 28:09.087
(Ring)

28:09.088 --> 28:10.889
(Sighs)

28:10.890 --> 28:12.320
(Exhales)

28:12.321 --> 28:14.322
Just make sure
this is about Lacey

28:14.323 --> 28:17.425
and not... About your own stuff.

28:17.426 --> 28:19.427
Okay? I gotta go. Thanks.

28:19.428 --> 28:22.000
Yeah.

28:22.001 --> 28:23.832
(Megan) Bryn told Zoe

28:23.833 --> 28:26.374
that she stopped somebody
from putting down a horse.

28:26.375 --> 28:28.376
So maybe that led
to putting down Bryn?

28:28.377 --> 28:29.938
We figure out what's
wrong with that horse,

28:29.939 --> 28:31.910
maybe we can
isolate Bryn's killer.

28:31.911 --> 28:33.281
Well, I mean, I'm
no veterinarian,

28:33.282 --> 28:35.483
but just looking at these
x-rays, I can tell you,

28:35.484 --> 28:38.346
he's got arthritis, splints,
deterioration of the skeleton.

28:38.347 --> 28:40.048
I mean, this is an old horse.

28:40.049 --> 28:42.050
Will Brooks sold
it as a show horse.

28:42.051 --> 28:44.222
I mean, why would he
think it could compete?

28:44.223 --> 28:47.726
Sell ice to eskimos.
Check out the teeth.

28:49.959 --> 28:51.900
It looks like somebody
filed them down

28:51.901 --> 28:53.832
and filled them with something.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.834
(Megan) So that's
why the horse flinched.

28:55.835 --> 28:58.336
Will must have had
silver nitrate on his hands.

28:58.337 --> 29:00.068
Come again?

29:00.069 --> 29:02.240
It's called bishoping.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.242
It's this horrible process

29:04.243 --> 29:07.515
where they use silver nitrate
to alter the shape of the teeth

29:07.516 --> 29:09.848
to make the horse look younger.

29:09.849 --> 29:11.279
And then sell it
at a higher price.

29:11.280 --> 29:14.422
So maybe Bryn discovered
that Brooks was bishoping horses.

29:14.423 --> 29:19.258
And then he killed
Bryn to shut her up.

29:23.893 --> 29:26.896
(Horse neighing)

29:38.077 --> 29:40.078
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

29:40.079 --> 29:42.951
What are you searching
through my stuff for?

29:42.952 --> 29:44.813
I thought a
prisoner killed Bryn.

29:44.814 --> 29:46.815
Yeah? Well, she wasn't
bishoping horses, was she?

29:46.816 --> 29:48.286
Keep an eye on him.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.118
Horses freak me
out, but I feel for them,

29:50.119 --> 29:53.562
knowing guys like that exist.

30:09.038 --> 30:10.909
Hey, I got something.

30:10.910 --> 30:12.480
Huh?

30:12.481 --> 30:14.943
Succinylcholine, empty.

30:14.944 --> 30:17.215
(Imitates mister
ed) Well, wilbur,

30:17.216 --> 30:20.188
we just need to
find the syringe.

30:20.189 --> 30:21.419
You feel better now
you got that out?

30:21.420 --> 30:23.391
(Normal voice) Oh, yeah.

30:23.392 --> 30:25.393
Much better.

30:25.394 --> 30:27.896
(Morris) Bryn was planning
on going to the authorities.

30:27.897 --> 30:30.328
That's why you
sabotaged her saddle

30:30.329 --> 30:31.900
and shot her full of that drug.

30:31.901 --> 30:34.562
I didn't kill Bryn,
okay? We had a deal.

30:34.563 --> 30:35.563
What deal?

30:35.564 --> 30:37.565
She caught me. Okay.

30:37.566 --> 30:40.869
I promised to stop bishoping
horses if she kept quiet,

30:40.870 --> 30:42.871
and in return, I would give

30:42.872 --> 30:44.873
all the old horses to
her therapy program.

30:44.874 --> 30:46.875
You would just give
her all the horses?

30:46.876 --> 30:49.948
That, or I could sell 'em
for dog food. (Morris) Wow.

30:49.949 --> 30:52.951
You really are a poster child
for animal rights. I kept my end.

30:52.952 --> 30:55.924
I stayed out all night helping
her with the damn horse.

30:55.925 --> 30:57.555
Helping her how? It had colic,

30:57.556 --> 30:59.427
so you have to keep it moving.

30:59.428 --> 31:01.129
You have to keep walking it.

31:01.130 --> 31:04.332
And the last time I saw
this, it was in Bryn's hand.

31:04.333 --> 31:07.035
Come on. I swear to you.

31:07.036 --> 31:08.866
Somebody's setting me up.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.368
I'll hold him on animal cruelty,

31:10.369 --> 31:12.370
but for the murder, I need
confirmation on the drug.

31:12.371 --> 31:13.902
We'll get it to
the lab right now.

31:13.903 --> 31:16.104
Any chance that Zoe set will up?

31:16.105 --> 31:18.907
(Morris) I don't think so.
I talked to Zoe's mother.

31:18.908 --> 31:21.910
It was Bryn calling her from
the stable office, not Zoe.

31:21.911 --> 31:23.051
Why?

31:23.052 --> 31:24.913
Well, Bryn wanted
Zoe to see her daughter

31:24.914 --> 31:27.385
so they could connect
before she got out.

31:27.386 --> 31:29.387
And the mother was against that?

31:29.388 --> 31:31.319
You can't convince
somebody you've changed

31:31.320 --> 31:33.561
if they don't want
to believe you.

31:33.562 --> 31:35.924
Zoe said that. And
her mother didn't buy it.

31:35.925 --> 31:37.025
She's on the fence.

31:37.026 --> 31:39.668
What do you think, detective?

31:45.034 --> 31:47.275
(Chuckles)

31:47.276 --> 31:49.337
(Elevator bell dings)

31:49.338 --> 31:51.339
"4 horses... 8.9
million results"?

31:51.340 --> 31:53.041
I gotta go. Yeah.

31:53.042 --> 31:54.342
My god.

31:54.343 --> 31:55.643
Megan.

31:55.644 --> 31:57.485
Oh. Who are you here to see?

31:57.486 --> 31:59.017
Uh, you.

31:59.018 --> 32:01.019
Mm. Can you hang on?

32:01.020 --> 32:03.021
This will just take
a second, all right?

32:03.022 --> 32:03.993
What?

32:03.994 --> 32:05.994
(Sighs) I thought about it,

32:05.995 --> 32:07.996
and... I think

32:07.997 --> 32:11.359
Lacey should stay
with you this weekend.

32:11.360 --> 32:13.431
Okay. Great.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.433
Because I've been
doing some thinking, too,

32:15.434 --> 32:16.934
and I want to be more
involved in her life.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.037
From now on, I want
her every other weekend.

32:19.038 --> 32:20.268
(Chuckles) Wow.

32:20.269 --> 32:22.440
I extend an olive branch,
you want the whole tree.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.072
I think Lacey would
want me to... Megan.

32:24.073 --> 32:25.443
No, Megan, Megan...
(Cell phone rings)

32:25.444 --> 32:27.415
Hold that thought.
Yeah, sure. I'll do that.

32:27.416 --> 32:28.576
Hello.

32:28.577 --> 32:30.618
Uh-huh.

32:30.619 --> 32:32.621
Yeah, I'll tell him.

32:34.984 --> 32:36.954
Oh, no, no. Do not
look at me like that.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.186
Same old Megan. No, I'm not.

32:38.187 --> 32:40.428
What I am is done trying
to prove myself to you.

32:40.429 --> 32:43.591
And that was Lacey.
You're late to pick her up.

32:43.592 --> 32:45.663
What? I can't...

32:45.664 --> 32:48.166
I gotta go. I-I will
talk to you later.

32:48.167 --> 32:50.539
I gotta... wow.

33:01.750 --> 33:04.582
Todd was just here.

33:04.583 --> 33:07.515
He had to leave
to pick up Lacey,

33:07.516 --> 33:10.258
otherwise I'm sure he
would've come by to say hello.

33:10.259 --> 33:11.719
It's fine, Megan.

33:11.720 --> 33:14.422
He doesn't have to see me
every time he comes to see you.

33:14.423 --> 33:17.025
(Chuckles) That's
very adult of you.

33:17.026 --> 33:19.367
Well, I don't imagine i'm
gonna lose him to you, am I?

33:19.368 --> 33:20.368
(Laughs)

33:20.369 --> 33:23.031
No, he's all yours.

33:23.032 --> 33:25.033
(Laughs) I don't
know if I'd go that far.

33:25.034 --> 33:26.704
Well, at least for the weekend.

33:26.705 --> 33:29.137
Lacey's staying with me.

33:29.138 --> 33:31.479
Oh, I'm glad to hear it.

33:31.480 --> 33:33.681
Listen, I know Todd.

33:33.682 --> 33:36.013
I know, this kind of decision,

33:36.014 --> 33:39.788
he didn't get there without
someone kicking him in the...

33:41.450 --> 33:43.291
So...

33:43.292 --> 33:45.293
You're actually
here to thank me?

33:45.294 --> 33:48.626
What I'm trying to say is...

33:48.627 --> 33:52.730
That you're sorry.

33:52.731 --> 33:54.732
There may have been times

33:54.733 --> 33:58.166
when I took my anger
at Todd out on you,

33:58.167 --> 34:00.038
and...

34:01.110 --> 34:03.111
I'm really bad at this.

34:03.112 --> 34:04.572
Oh, for god sake. Just say it.

34:04.573 --> 34:06.043
Okay. I'm sorry and thank you.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.445
(Slaps thighs)

34:07.446 --> 34:10.047
Now see? Was it that hard?

34:10.048 --> 34:12.180
(Knock on door)

34:12.181 --> 34:14.252
Yes, Curtis.

34:14.253 --> 34:16.124
We've got a problem.

34:16.125 --> 34:18.126
I checked the amount
of Succinylcholine

34:18.127 --> 34:20.188
left in the syringe Ethan found.

34:20.189 --> 34:21.459
Is this right?

34:21.460 --> 34:23.262
She didn't get
enough to kill her.

34:30.799 --> 34:33.141
There was enough
Succinylcholine in Bryn's system

34:33.142 --> 34:35.603
to paralyze her, but
not enough to kill her.

34:35.604 --> 34:37.105
She was still alive
lying in that ravine?

34:37.106 --> 34:38.806
That's cold.

34:38.807 --> 34:40.077
So what stopped her breathing?

34:40.078 --> 34:42.110
I assumed the manure
at the crime scene

34:42.111 --> 34:43.451
came from the white horse,

34:43.452 --> 34:46.684
so I ran his d.N.A.
Against it to double-check.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.456
It wasn't a match.

34:48.457 --> 34:50.158
Ethan, we're trying
to solve a murder.

34:50.159 --> 34:52.220
Go take your 4-h
project somewhere else.

34:52.221 --> 34:53.521
Don't you get it?

34:53.522 --> 34:56.364
The manure wasn't from the
horse that Bryn was riding, Sherlock.

34:56.365 --> 34:57.495
So someone else
rode a different horse

34:57.496 --> 34:58.626
out to the crime scene.

34:58.627 --> 35:01.130
Yes, and he ate something shiny.

35:06.735 --> 35:07.875
Glitter.

35:07.876 --> 35:09.707
Somehow he ingested it.

35:09.708 --> 35:11.479
Why would a horse eat glitter?

35:11.480 --> 35:12.680
He wouldn't.

35:12.681 --> 35:14.682
(Peter) We found glitter
on Bryn at autopsy.

35:14.683 --> 35:17.245
Traces of it on her lips.

35:17.246 --> 35:19.247
(Ethan) So she ate it, too?

35:19.248 --> 35:23.751
No, she didn'teatanything.

35:23.752 --> 35:25.894
She inhaled it.

35:27.456 --> 35:30.899
The glitter was on
the killer's hands

35:32.631 --> 35:36.165
that's what made
her stop breathing.

35:39.438 --> 35:41.138
He suffocated her.

35:41.139 --> 35:44.141
Why would a horseback
rider have glitter on his hands?

35:44.142 --> 35:45.914
To win.

36:06.164 --> 36:07.735
(Snorts)

36:07.736 --> 36:10.298
(Neighs)

36:10.299 --> 36:13.170
(Snorts)

36:13.171 --> 36:15.173
(Tires scrape gravel)

36:16.405 --> 36:17.505
Hey there.

36:17.506 --> 36:18.876
Hi.

36:18.877 --> 36:22.280
Could you get off the
horse, please, Mr. Savage?

36:22.281 --> 36:24.383
Off the horse, please.

36:26.255 --> 36:28.716
Hi.

36:28.717 --> 36:32.260
You give your horse
every advantage, don't you?

36:32.261 --> 36:35.323
Numb its pain with drugs,

36:35.324 --> 36:38.667
coat shine on his nose
to make it all shiny.

36:40.899 --> 36:44.532
We found it in
Bryn's eyes and nose.

36:44.533 --> 36:47.935
Your own special
brand, remember?

36:47.936 --> 36:50.978
You forgot it was on your
glove when you suffocated her.

36:50.979 --> 36:52.840
That's crazy. Why
would I do that?

36:52.841 --> 36:53.942
Jealousy.

36:55.444 --> 36:57.585
I saw the phone records
from the stable office

36:57.586 --> 36:59.247
the night before Bryn died.

36:59.248 --> 37:02.520
You called there repeatedly.
You thought she was with will.

37:02.521 --> 37:04.252
You were right.

37:04.253 --> 37:05.953
Making all those times that
she beat you in competition

37:05.954 --> 37:07.755
feel that much worse.

37:07.756 --> 37:09.757
Some men just can't handle that.

37:09.758 --> 37:12.300
But her betrayal gave
you the perfect way

37:12.301 --> 37:15.002
to get rid of
her... Pin it on will.

37:15.003 --> 37:17.535
(Morris) You sabotaged
her saddle, sent her off

37:17.536 --> 37:19.867
on her afternoon ride
paralyzed with Succinylcholine,

37:19.868 --> 37:21.969
and then let her
horse do the rest.

37:21.970 --> 37:23.471
You put the
evidence in will's shed,

37:23.472 --> 37:24.942
will takes the fall,

37:24.943 --> 37:27.775
and then you start winning
blue ribbons instead of red.

37:27.776 --> 37:29.777
What happened,
James... The horse reared,

37:29.778 --> 37:31.279
you didn't get the
needle in far enough?

37:31.280 --> 37:33.981
You screwed up. That's
why you went out there.

37:33.982 --> 37:37.325
(Megan) You knew there was a
chance she would survive. (Whimpering)

37:37.326 --> 37:42.460
You had to go out there
to finish her off yourself.

37:42.461 --> 37:47.435
Her punishment for being
better than you will ever be.

37:47.436 --> 37:49.297
Better?

37:49.298 --> 37:53.701
So... she cheats on me
with some trailer-park loser,

37:53.702 --> 37:55.573
and you think that
she's better than me?

37:55.574 --> 37:59.006
Oh, well, you showed
her, didn't you?

37:59.007 --> 38:02.049
The thing is, James,

38:02.050 --> 38:04.712
she didn't cheat on you.

38:04.713 --> 38:07.585
Yeah, she was with will,

38:07.586 --> 38:09.358
saving a horse's life.

38:11.289 --> 38:14.362
You're under arrest for
the murder of Bryn Walker.

38:14.363 --> 38:16.063
You have the right
to remain silent.

38:16.064 --> 38:19.296
Anything you say can and will be used
in a court of law. (Handcuffs clicking)

38:19.297 --> 38:21.298
You have the
right to an attorney.

38:21.299 --> 38:22.430
If you cannot
afford an attorney,

38:22.431 --> 38:23.771
an attorney will
be provided for you.

38:23.772 --> 38:25.574
Do you understand these rights?

38:32.511 --> 38:35.513
Some former prisoners
took up a collection.

38:35.514 --> 38:39.046
They're planning a
memorial for Bryn.

38:39.047 --> 38:42.620
So she does have
a family after all.

38:42.621 --> 38:45.823
Any word from Todd?

38:45.824 --> 38:47.595
Yeah.

38:47.596 --> 38:49.597
He's agreed to let me have Lacey

38:49.598 --> 38:51.959
every other weekend. (Chuckles)

38:51.960 --> 38:54.402
We're telling her tonight.

38:54.403 --> 38:56.534
Be careful what
you wish for, huh?

38:56.535 --> 38:58.035
(Both chuckle)

38:58.036 --> 39:01.038
I, um, found the four
horses, by the way.

39:01.039 --> 39:03.070
It's a discourse by the Buddha.

39:03.071 --> 39:04.642
The Buddha?

39:04.643 --> 39:06.343
Uh-huh. (Laughs)

39:06.344 --> 39:08.045
Um... the excellent horse

39:08.046 --> 39:12.079
moves before the
whip touches its back.

39:12.080 --> 39:15.583
The good horse runs
at the lightest touch.

39:15.584 --> 39:19.056
The poor horse doesn't
move until he feels pain.

39:19.057 --> 39:23.060
And then there's
the very bad horse.

39:23.061 --> 39:28.497
He doesn't move until the
whip penetrates his marrow.

39:30.098 --> 39:32.369
My car accident...

39:32.370 --> 39:35.543
Was my whip.

39:35.544 --> 39:38.145
It broke me.

39:38.146 --> 39:40.548
And it...

39:40.549 --> 39:43.451
Brought me back to Lacey.

39:43.452 --> 39:46.554
What if I screw up again?

39:46.555 --> 39:48.487
You won't.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.921
You won't.

39:57.165 --> 39:59.468
(Exhales deeply)

40:09.938 --> 40:12.941
(Speaking indistinctly)

40:18.416 --> 40:21.490
We caught Bryn Walker's killer.

40:23.452 --> 40:25.523
And her program's
gonna continue,

40:25.524 --> 40:29.156
so you'll have a job
when you get out.

40:29.157 --> 40:31.529
I appreciate that.

40:31.530 --> 40:34.463
There's one other thing.

40:42.070 --> 40:44.112
Oh, my god.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.977
Hi, baby.

40:49.978 --> 40:52.049
Mommy.

40:52.050 --> 40:54.051
You're so beautiful.

40:54.052 --> 40:55.183
(Sighs)

41:11.540 --> 41:14.041
So, uh, your mother
and I were talking,

41:14.042 --> 41:16.644
and... and we were wondering...

41:16.645 --> 41:20.077
If you wanted to stay
with her more often.

41:20.078 --> 41:22.149
But it... it's no
pressure. If... if... if...

41:22.150 --> 41:24.251
Yeah. If you don't
want to, that's okay, too.

41:24.252 --> 41:25.252
Yeah.

41:25.253 --> 41:28.216
No, no, I-I would like to.

41:29.618 --> 41:31.018
Okay.

41:31.019 --> 41:33.490
Okay, good. We'll come up
with some kind of schedule.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.222
All right? Something
you can count on.

41:35.223 --> 41:37.124
Maybe every other
weekend to start, okay?

41:37.125 --> 41:40.568
Does that mean I can stay
with mom this weekend?

41:40.569 --> 41:42.499
(Laughs)

41:42.500 --> 41:44.501
Yeah, it... sure.

41:44.502 --> 41:46.974
And can I go to the party?

41:46.975 --> 41:48.637
(Laughs)

41:51.039 --> 41:52.810
How about...

41:52.811 --> 41:57.115
You and I go see
a movie together?

41:58.286 --> 42:01.218
It's a pretty good compromise.

42:01.219 --> 42:03.220
Yeah. Yeah, I'll...
I'll check online.

42:03.221 --> 42:06.254
I'll see what the showtimes are.

42:09.758 --> 42:11.228
(Blows air)

42:11.229 --> 42:14.201
(Laughs)

42:14.202 --> 42:15.903
Nice save.

42:15.904 --> 42:17.565
I'm learning. Yeah.

42:17.566 --> 42:18.737
(Laughs)

42:21.209 --> 42:23.211
Oh.
