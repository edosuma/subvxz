WEBVTT

00:07.511 --> 00:08.455
Hustle it up.

00:08.491 --> 00:09.939
Previously on House of Lies...

00:09.940 --> 00:11.727
I know you thought you'd
made it into Marty's most

00:11.728 --> 00:13.961
intimate circle, and here
comes Jeannie, and just like that...

00:13.996 --> 00:16.664
booted unceremoniously down the
hall, out of the old pussay.

00:16.666 --> 00:17.381
Ew.

00:17.416 --> 00:18.666
I want to buy you, Marty.

00:18.668 --> 00:20.551
It's been a while since your people

00:20.586 --> 00:21.919
could buy my people.

00:21.971 --> 00:24.138
This offer is no longer exclusive.

00:24.173 --> 00:27.308
Seven times my
revenue... when Skip buys my firm,

00:27.343 --> 00:28.893
that is what he's gonna
put in my pocket.

00:28.928 --> 00:30.728
Maybe we
take this away from Monica.

00:30.763 --> 00:31.952
Well, fuck yeah.

00:31.953 --> 00:35.074
I'm gonna get my
company so pumped up,

00:35.075 --> 00:38.319
that my valuations are just jacked.

20 stories tall,

00:44.760 --> 00:46.961
four football fields in length.

00:46.996 --> 00:48.696
Movie theater, retail shops.

00:48.748 --> 00:51.365
And it ain't even the
biggest ship in the fleet.

00:51.417 --> 00:54.535
Oh, put on your slickers and grab
your chum buckets, kiddies,

00:54.587 --> 00:57.371
because from this point on,
it is big game fishing only.

00:57.373 --> 00:59.173
Ugh. As opposed to
before, when, you know,

00:59.208 --> 01:00.591
we were just fucking around.

01:00.626 --> 01:02.676
Hey, it's fired-up
Marty. I love fired-up Marty.

01:02.712 --> 01:04.044
Last year, Palace Cruises did...

01:04.096 --> 01:05.262
Just over

01:05.298 --> 01:07.097
4.6 billion in revenue.

01:07.133 --> 01:08.716
God, I love that word... billion!

01:08.768 --> 01:10.688
'Cause you know what
billion-dollar clients mean?

01:10.720 --> 01:14.138
Big fat fucking zeros at
the end of that fat-ass check

01:14.190 --> 01:16.890
that Skip Galweather's gonna
cut to acquire K and A.

01:16.943 --> 01:19.610
Assuming your ex-wife doesn't
win the offer first.

01:19.645 --> 01:22.279
Correct, which is why I want this
particular whale harpooned

01:22.315 --> 01:23.897
and rendered by the time

01:23.899 --> 01:25.532
we reach port of call in
the next couple of days.

01:25.568 --> 01:27.117
Puts us back on a plane to L.A.,

01:27.153 --> 01:29.069
where we will secure more business

01:29.071 --> 01:31.205
and make ourselves
un-fucking-deniable.

01:31.240 --> 01:32.539
And I can get back to our child.

01:32.575 --> 01:34.658
Well, yes, we got to get
back to Phoebe. Phoebe, of course.

01:34.710 --> 01:35.876
But can we make it happen, captain?

01:35.911 --> 01:37.077
Yes, we can.

01:37.129 --> 01:38.245
And can we make it happen, Douglas?!

01:38.297 --> 01:39.413
Just call me Ishmael.

01:39.465 --> 01:41.048
Uh, can we make it happen, Clyde?

01:41.083 --> 01:42.955
Clyde, would you like to stop looking...

01:42.956 --> 01:43.634
I got it. I got it. I got it.

01:43.669 --> 01:44.918
Get in here. We're doing a thing.

01:44.920 --> 01:46.553
Winning business good, losing bad.

01:46.589 --> 01:48.389
Jeannie wants to see her kid.
I'm with you, chief. Let's go.

01:48.424 --> 01:49.556
Great. Dinner's in a couple hours.

01:49.592 --> 01:50.808
Till that time, we're gonna get settled,

01:50.843 --> 01:51.976
take a look around the ship,

01:52.011 --> 01:53.143
try to come up with something nice

01:53.179 --> 01:54.311
to say to the captain and CEO at dinner.

01:54.347 --> 01:56.263
The captain? Hold up, hold up, hold up.

01:56.315 --> 01:57.681
Are you serious?

01:57.733 --> 01:59.433
We're sitting at the
captain's table tonight?

01:59.485 --> 02:00.734
Don't fuck with me on this, Marty.

02:00.770 --> 02:01.742
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

02:01.743 --> 02:03.737
It's just that this ship is
captained by Megan Dunleavy.

02:03.773 --> 02:06.273
One of the few female
captains in the cruise line industry.

02:06.325 --> 02:07.608
Get this. She worked her way up

02:07.660 --> 02:09.943
to master mariner in three short years.

02:09.996 --> 02:11.716
So what's the term if
it happens out at sea?

02:11.747 --> 02:13.247
Is it still considered stalking?

02:13.282 --> 02:14.248
- It's called stalking, right?
- I'd call it stalking.

02:14.283 --> 02:15.249
What about sea stalking?

02:15.284 --> 02:16.617
It's stalking for sure.

02:16.669 --> 02:19.620
Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie, it
is every little boy's fantasy

02:19.672 --> 02:21.422
to sleep with a ship
captain, am I right?

02:21.457 --> 02:23.090
Oh, Doug.

02:23.125 --> 02:24.708
It absolutely is not.

02:24.760 --> 02:25.926
What?

02:25.961 --> 02:27.795
I've never had that fantasy before,

02:27.847 --> 02:29.880
and I will fuck anything.

02:29.932 --> 02:31.799
And don't you have a girlfriend

02:31.801 --> 02:33.684
who also happens to be our client?

02:33.719 --> 02:35.302
Well, uh, Marty, we
never said we were exclusive.

02:35.304 --> 02:36.470
I don't give a shit.

02:36.522 --> 02:38.305
See? Marty gets it, yeah?

02:38.357 --> 02:40.057
No stranger himself to the joys

02:40.109 --> 02:42.559
of mixing business and pleasure. Up top.

02:42.611 --> 02:44.395
That, and the fact that
she already signed a contract.

02:44.447 --> 02:45.779
- Up top! Don't give a shit.
- Ah.

02:46.816 --> 02:48.032
Wasn't that funny.

02:48.067 --> 02:49.316
It's not what I'm laughing at.

02:49.368 --> 02:50.484
Is that Marty Kaan?!

02:50.536 --> 02:52.119
- Oh, no.
-  Oh, yes.

02:52.154 --> 02:53.404
Oh, no, no, no, no.

02:53.456 --> 02:56.040
Ooh, come to get his dick
wet on the high seas, eh?!

02:56.075 --> 02:57.458
It is!

02:57.493 --> 02:58.625
Unbelievable!

02:58.661 --> 02:59.827
- Fucking Dushkins.
-  Oh, yeah.

02:59.879 --> 03:01.128
Unbelievable.

03:01.163 --> 03:02.296
Oh, the whole gang is here!

03:02.331 --> 03:03.664
Alex and Kyle.

03:03.716 --> 03:05.196
What the fuck are you guys doing here?

03:05.217 --> 03:06.667
Palace Cruises begged us...

03:06.719 --> 03:07.835
Begged us!

03:07.887 --> 03:09.053
To come run a club night for them.

03:09.088 --> 03:10.288
And we are fucking killing it.

03:10.306 --> 03:11.588
- Yes!
- Yay.

03:11.640 --> 03:12.756
You gotta come.

03:12.808 --> 03:13.891
Oh, look at this.

03:13.926 --> 03:16.343
"So much fun, you'll ship your pants."

03:16.395 --> 03:18.512
You'll ship your pants, bro!

03:18.514 --> 03:20.397
Ha-ha!

03:20.433 --> 03:22.015
Okay. Wow.

03:24.937 --> 03:26.320
On the count of three,

03:26.355 --> 03:29.106
the first knot you ever learned
to tie. You ready?

03:29.158 --> 03:31.325
One, two, three. Cleat hitch!

03:31.360 --> 03:32.993
I think it was a sheet bend.

03:33.028 --> 03:34.528
A sheet bend?

03:34.580 --> 03:36.280
That was the second one I learned.

03:36.332 --> 03:37.612
Wow.

03:37.616 --> 03:39.533
God, you're just full of surprises.

03:39.585 --> 03:40.522
Let me ask you something.

03:40.523 --> 03:43.787
Would you mind me citing your
story in my upcoming TED talk?

03:43.839 --> 03:45.589
Oh, my God, Douglas, are
you giving a TED talk?

03:45.624 --> 03:46.590
Why didn't you tell anybody?

03:46.625 --> 03:48.125
We would've loved to know about that.

03:48.177 --> 03:49.426
See, part of my talk's

03:49.462 --> 03:51.011
about overcoming adversity,

03:51.046 --> 03:52.379
and I think your story, Captain,

03:52.431 --> 03:54.598
would be an inspirational example.

03:54.633 --> 03:57.050
I'm sorry. My-my story of adversity?

03:57.103 --> 03:58.352
Well, yeah.

03:58.387 --> 04:00.020
You know, being a woman.

04:01.857 --> 04:03.257
Well, in a male-dominated profession

04:03.275 --> 04:04.858
is what... You know what I meant.

04:04.894 --> 04:06.226
Douglas, maybe you should stop digging.

04:06.278 --> 04:07.444
I feel like the hole

04:07.480 --> 04:09.313
is deep enough.

04:09.365 --> 04:11.198
Yeah.

04:12.234 --> 04:13.317
Hmm.

04:15.237 --> 04:18.071
Earlier, I was telling
Marty how impressed I am

04:18.072 --> 04:20.290
that you do all your business onboard.

04:20.326 --> 04:22.125
Mm.

04:25.381 --> 04:28.499
I do think it'sortant to understand

04:28.551 --> 04:30.584
how much fun we have around here.

04:31.637 --> 04:33.170
Yes.

04:33.222 --> 04:34.588
That's clear.

04:36.142 --> 04:37.508
So, how can we be more profitable?

04:38.928 --> 04:41.345
Well, we're still replatforming

04:41.397 --> 04:43.480
the journey line, you
know, to trend-jack

04:43.516 --> 04:45.182
secular market space migration,

04:45.234 --> 04:47.935
exploring ancillary liquidity scenarios.

04:47.987 --> 04:49.319
It's gonna take a...

04:49.355 --> 04:50.487
gonna take a minute.

04:50.523 --> 04:52.189
- I see.
- Mm-hmm.

04:52.241 --> 04:54.491
Well, I guess I'll just
have to wait till the morning.

04:55.661 --> 04:57.861
Mm-hmm. Ready for me?

04:57.913 --> 04:58.946
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

04:58.948 --> 04:59.997
Do you wear that
jacket everywhere?

05:00.032 --> 05:00.998
I do.

05:01.033 --> 05:02.449
Is there any chance...?

05:02.501 --> 05:03.867
Clyde, hey.

05:03.919 --> 05:06.203
I need you to fast-track a deck
with some good solutions

05:06.255 --> 05:08.505
that we can put in front of
this guy first thing in the morning.

05:08.541 --> 05:09.840
Sure.

05:09.875 --> 05:11.592
And you're still sitting here...?

05:11.627 --> 05:12.626
I'll do it after
dinner. What am I gonna do?

05:12.628 --> 05:13.627
I'm at the table right now.

05:13.679 --> 05:14.711
You're gonna do this.

05:14.763 --> 05:15.796
Right now, we're eating with

05:15.798 --> 05:16.880
- the captain right now.
- Clyde.

05:16.932 --> 05:17.881
Clyde.

05:17.933 --> 05:19.099
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:19.134 --> 05:20.300
Let me steal you for one second,

05:20.352 --> 05:22.112
- just because I may have to leave.
- Mm-hmm.

05:22.721 --> 05:23.687
What the fuck?

05:23.722 --> 05:25.472
Was I not just crystal clear?

05:25.524 --> 05:26.857
You were.

05:26.892 --> 05:28.058
It's almost as if

05:28.110 --> 05:29.476
he has nothing to gain

05:29.528 --> 05:31.028
and a whole lot to lose

05:31.063 --> 05:32.696
if this sale to Skip goes through.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:44.076 --> 05:45.709
Let's get wet!

05:48.631 --> 05:49.880
All right, well, remember
it's not cheating

05:49.915 --> 05:51.215
in international waters.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.417
- Enchanté.
- Nice.

05:53.469 --> 05:54.885
Clyde,

05:54.920 --> 05:56.086
you have got to fuck the captain.

05:56.138 --> 05:57.671
Yep, put it in her port

05:57.723 --> 05:58.639
and her stern.

05:58.674 --> 05:59.590
Those are boat terms!

05:59.642 --> 06:00.459
Excuse me!

06:00.460 --> 06:02.060
That's our captain you're talking about.

06:02.094 --> 06:02.976
You show some respect.

06:03.012 --> 06:04.368
And I'm sure she was simply

06:04.369 --> 06:06.730
being cordial to a
passenger at her table.

06:06.765 --> 06:08.181
I don't think she's
gonna go and fuck Clyde.

06:08.234 --> 06:09.483
All right, Doug.

06:09.518 --> 06:11.238
I'm sure she offers tours
of the engine room

06:11.270 --> 06:12.519
to, like, everybody, right?

06:12.571 --> 06:15.072
- Bro, are you kidding me?!
- What? What, what, what?

06:15.107 --> 06:16.773
Engine room is totally off-limits
to passengers.

06:16.825 --> 06:18.191
She didn't make it seem that way.

06:18.244 --> 06:19.444
You know what's not off-limits?

06:19.445 --> 06:20.444
Don't say her vagina.

06:20.496 --> 06:21.995
Her pussy!

06:22.948 --> 06:23.947
Excuse me, excuse me.

06:23.999 --> 06:25.365
Hey!

06:25.417 --> 06:26.500
Hey!

06:26.535 --> 06:28.168
Clyde? Doug?

06:28.203 --> 06:29.536
The fuck are you doing here?

06:29.588 --> 06:30.982
Clyde's gonna fuck the captain.

06:31.063 --> 06:32.539
Right in the engine room.

06:32.591 --> 06:34.181
That is awesome.

06:34.309 --> 06:36.426
Uh, but before that
happens, we got a little business

06:36.462 --> 06:37.628
that we need to talk about.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.179
So fuck off, Dushkins.

06:39.214 --> 06:40.797
Ah.

06:40.849 --> 06:42.099
Bye.

06:42.134 --> 06:43.313
- You guys want a drink?
-  No.

06:43.314 --> 06:45.719
I want to know what the
fuck you are doing here

06:45.721 --> 06:46.876
and not in the data dump room.

06:46.877 --> 06:49.106
Yeah, well, we were in the
data dump room, Marty.

06:49.141 --> 06:50.557
And the data dump
room led us right here.

06:50.559 --> 06:51.775
Why don't you take a look around?

06:51.810 --> 06:53.360
This place is fucking packed.

06:53.395 --> 06:55.896
They got V.I.P. booths.
They have bottle service.

06:55.948 --> 06:57.905
There is a motherfucking line

06:58.043 --> 07:00.400
to get into a club on a cruise ship.

07:00.452 --> 07:01.535
But you want to know the best part?

07:01.570 --> 07:02.903
None of it is covered

07:02.905 --> 07:04.321
in the all-inclusive package.

07:04.373 --> 07:07.040
But all these people
are more than happy to pay,

07:07.048 --> 07:08.041
because?

07:08.077 --> 07:09.376
Because it's alcohol

07:09.411 --> 07:10.911
and it's vacation and fuck it.

07:10.963 --> 07:12.746
- Mm.
- Fuck it.

07:12.748 --> 07:14.043
And fuck it.

07:14.446 --> 07:15.882
Think about it.

07:17.419 --> 07:18.385
Oh, no.

07:18.420 --> 07:19.803
- Yeah.
- No.

07:19.838 --> 07:21.221
- No.
- I know this goes against

07:21.256 --> 07:23.507
every fiber of your being, but
we ran the numbers, okay?

07:23.559 --> 07:26.593
The play to secure
optimal profits for Palace Cruises

07:26.645 --> 07:28.762
and a shit-ton of
after-work for K and A...

07:28.814 --> 07:30.647
- Don't.
- is standing

07:30.683 --> 07:32.265
right over there,

07:32.318 --> 07:34.651
dressed in suits made of cartoons.

07:34.687 --> 07:37.714
Oh, fuck yeah! Who's
having a good time tonight?

07:58.677 --> 08:01.712
A dedicated party
ship run by the Dushkins?

08:01.764 --> 08:05.265
That is our recommendation, yeah.

08:05.300 --> 08:09.219
Here are some first-year
profit projections, sir.

08:09.271 --> 08:10.721
Hmm.

08:11.807 --> 08:13.974
Fuck me.

08:14.026 --> 08:16.443
The Dushkins have
already made you a lot of money

08:16.478 --> 08:17.894
in a short amount of time

08:17.946 --> 08:19.363
with a limited amount of space.

08:19.398 --> 08:20.822
Implement this expansion...

08:20.824 --> 08:23.817
And they'll make you a boatload more.

08:23.819 --> 08:25.786
It helps if you look at the boat. Okay.

08:25.821 --> 08:26.787
Doug.

08:26.822 --> 08:29.039
You're suggesting that I expand

08:29.074 --> 08:31.208
business dealings with the Dushkins?

08:31.243 --> 08:33.794
Have you spent time with these men?

08:33.828 --> 08:34.828
- Yes.
-  Yes.

08:34.880 --> 08:35.912
They're-they're assholes.

08:35.964 --> 08:37.464
Uh, I'm gonna stop you there.

08:37.499 --> 08:38.881
They're huge assholes.

08:38.917 --> 08:41.802
But the fact of the matter
is they do have the Midas touch

08:41.837 --> 08:43.559
when it comes to party promotion.

08:43.701 --> 08:45.134
They know how to monetize the space

08:45.135 --> 08:46.640
better than anyone in the country.

08:46.675 --> 08:47.544
Well, that may be,

08:47.701 --> 08:49.843
but they won't even sign
the contract on this ship

08:49.845 --> 08:51.478
until the demands in
their rider are met.

08:51.513 --> 08:52.512
They-they have a rider?

08:52.564 --> 08:53.680
Oh, yeah.

08:53.682 --> 08:55.182
Let me just read
you a couple highlights.

08:55.234 --> 08:57.651
A private helicopter
to and from the boat.

08:57.686 --> 08:59.736
- Huh.
- Flying lessons.

08:59.772 --> 09:01.905
- Wow.
- One live-in masseuse.

09:01.940 --> 09:03.190
In parentheses, hot.

09:03.242 --> 09:04.491
One live-in chef.

09:04.526 --> 09:05.492
In parentheses...

09:05.527 --> 09:07.244
- hot.
- Hot. Yeah, saw that coming.

09:07.279 --> 09:08.912
Starting to sound like Jeannie's rider.

09:08.947 --> 09:10.697
'Cause of all the "hot"...

09:10.749 --> 09:12.149
- Yeah.
-  Oh, we're having fun.

09:12.167 --> 09:15.702
Listen, we've done
business with these guys before.

09:15.754 --> 09:17.045
We know how to talk to assholes.

09:17.196 --> 09:18.705
We speak fluent asshole, sir.

09:18.707 --> 09:19.840
- Thanks, Doug.
- You got it.

09:19.875 --> 09:21.341
And we believe

09:21.376 --> 09:24.010
that we can get them down
to some reasonable demands.

09:31.103 --> 09:33.053
Okay.

09:33.105 --> 09:36.022
You get this down to,
say, a page, we're in business.

09:36.942 --> 09:38.308
Do I have to say I'm skeptical?

09:38.360 --> 09:41.311
Please allow me to say
that we  look forward

09:41.363 --> 09:43.146
- to making you a believer.
-  Yes.

09:45.734 --> 09:47.701
Fuck...

09:47.736 --> 09:49.786
me.

09:51.206 --> 09:52.489
So, listen, Clyde,

09:52.541 --> 09:54.157
I don't want to get
into a pissing match with you

09:54.209 --> 09:55.492
- about the captain,
- Oh.

09:55.544 --> 09:57.210
So I'm respectfully asking
you to stand down.

09:57.246 --> 09:58.378
I would, but I really...

09:58.413 --> 09:59.830
I really do want to
see that engine room.

09:59.882 --> 10:01.131
Why? You've seen one
engine room, you've seen 'em all.

10:01.166 --> 10:02.666
- Who cares?
- No, but this one is supposed

10:02.718 --> 10:04.000
- to be special, and she's gonna
- No, it's not. It's boring.

10:04.052 --> 10:05.335
be the one that shows it to me.

10:05.387 --> 10:06.670
- So I really...
- Please don't. Please don't.

10:06.722 --> 10:07.547
I-I hate you.

10:07.726 --> 10:10.590
Best part is, you won't have
to put up with me for much longer.

10:10.592 --> 10:12.008
What does that mean?

10:12.060 --> 10:15.011
It means that if this
sale to Skip goes through,

10:15.063 --> 10:16.980
we are fucked, Douglas.

10:17.015 --> 10:18.982
Think about it, even
in a best-case scenario,

10:19.017 --> 10:20.984
if he doesn't fire us, you really think

10:21.019 --> 10:22.686
he's gonna let two guys
in the Marty Kaan regime

10:22.738 --> 10:23.820
fucking rise up the ranks?

10:23.856 --> 10:25.822
Oh, please. He doesn't remember us.

10:25.858 --> 10:26.949
- Really?!
- No.

10:27.114 --> 10:29.109
Okay, we saw him take a
shit in Marty's briefcase.

10:29.161 --> 10:30.443
You think he's gonna remember us, Doug?

10:30.496 --> 10:32.579
- Yeah, we're fucked.
- Yes.

10:32.614 --> 10:33.694
And do you want to know the

10:33.703 --> 10:34.823
- fucking worst part?
- What?

10:34.833 --> 10:36.116
Even after all these years,

10:36.168 --> 10:37.768
Marty never offered to make us partners.

10:37.786 --> 10:40.754
I mean, at least then we
would have a piece of the action.

10:40.789 --> 10:42.455
But now we have fucking nothing.

10:42.508 --> 10:44.958
Would have been nice, right?

10:46.678 --> 10:47.761
Yeah.

10:47.796 --> 10:49.880
All right, come on. We're up.

10:51.850 --> 10:53.466
Take that, loser!

10:55.187 --> 10:57.554
What the fuck? Goddamn
it, what did I tell you?

10:57.606 --> 10:58.555
Well, hello.

10:58.607 --> 10:59.806
Buenos dias.

10:59.858 --> 11:01.224
So what'd you guys think of the club?

11:01.276 --> 11:04.027
Um, to be honest, I found
it a little depressing.

11:04.062 --> 11:05.529
Depressing?! Hold on!

11:07.840 --> 11:09.115
Fuck do you mean the club's depressing?

11:09.151 --> 11:10.116
People love our club.

11:10.152 --> 11:11.151
They love our club.

11:11.203 --> 11:12.950
Last night, some old dude told us

11:12.951 --> 11:14.454
he got an under-the-table
handy from his wife.

11:14.489 --> 11:15.622
First time in 30 years.

11:15.657 --> 11:16.706
Does that sound depressing to you?

11:16.742 --> 11:18.041
Doesn't sound depressing to me.

11:18.076 --> 11:19.376
It's not not depressing.

11:19.411 --> 11:21.044
Guys, the club is fantastic.

11:21.079 --> 11:22.996
What's depressing is the
squandered opportunity.

11:23.048 --> 11:24.769
Right now, you're in a limited space,

11:24.934 --> 11:26.800
and you're just wasting your talents.

11:26.835 --> 11:28.385
Could you imagine if you owned

11:28.420 --> 11:29.553
an entire ship?

11:29.588 --> 11:32.339
Right? I mean, your own fucking ship.

11:32.391 --> 11:33.390
Owned by you,

11:33.425 --> 11:34.391
operated by you.

11:34.426 --> 11:36.426
Dushkin Party Cruise Lines.

11:36.478 --> 11:37.404
Did you just say "Dushkin

11:37.429 --> 11:38.478
- Party Cruise Lines"?
- Yeah.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.096
Jeannie, oh, my God, guess what I say.

11:40.148 --> 11:41.314
Sign me the fuck up.

11:43.352 --> 11:44.985
We fucking love this idea, Marty.

11:45.020 --> 11:46.403
Love this idea.

11:46.438 --> 11:47.988
- It's a great idea.
- Mm.

11:48.023 --> 11:49.823
First thing we're gonna
do is put in some real shops.

11:49.858 --> 11:51.608
Yeah, get rid of all
this family-friendly bullshit.

11:51.660 --> 11:53.222
Yeah, yeah, instead of Gap, Gucci.

11:53.247 --> 11:53.747
Ooh.

11:53.779 --> 11:55.579
Instead of that
stupid fucking M&M store...

11:55.614 --> 11:57.014
Yeah, yeah, yeah, an S and M store.

11:57.032 --> 11:58.531
Ow!

11:58.584 --> 11:59.866
- Instead of Starbucks...
- No, no, wait, wait.

11:59.918 --> 12:01.368
We'll... let's keep the Starbucks.

12:01.420 --> 12:02.442
We'll keep the Starbucks.

12:02.443 --> 12:03.920
Guys, you can do whatever you want.

12:03.956 --> 12:05.036
It's your own fucking ship.

12:05.040 --> 12:06.790
- Ooh, fucking love this idea!
- Yeah!

12:06.842 --> 12:08.124
How do we make this happen?

12:08.176 --> 12:09.615
Hey, Marty, can
I talk to you for a second?

12:09.616 --> 12:11.256
Uh, can it... can it wait?

12:11.257 --> 12:12.581
I mean, we're talking to the Dushkins

12:12.582 --> 12:14.014
about their own boat right now.

12:14.049 --> 12:15.015
Yeah, about that.

12:15.050 --> 12:17.217
Uh, we ran the numbers and, um...

12:17.269 --> 12:18.551
There's a problem.

12:18.604 --> 12:20.387
- What?
- What problem?

12:20.439 --> 12:22.055
Uh, looks like start-up costs

12:22.107 --> 12:23.885
are higher than we
initially projected, guys.

12:23.920 --> 12:25.753
Taking into account thip,

12:25.805 --> 12:27.405
upkeep, staff, basic insurance coverage.

12:27.424 --> 12:28.556
All in?

12:28.592 --> 12:29.924
You're looking at 200 mil.

12:29.976 --> 12:31.593
$200 million dollars?

12:31.645 --> 12:33.394
Marty, we don't have
$200 million dollars.

12:33.430 --> 12:35.396
So what? You're the
fucking Dushkins, you can get it.

12:35.432 --> 12:36.314
Yeah, we're sort of in this rebuilding

12:36.349 --> 12:37.348
phase right now though.

12:37.400 --> 12:39.120
Kind of doubled down on
our cologne, Snatch.

12:39.152 --> 12:40.902
- By Dushkin?
-  By Dushkin.

12:40.937 --> 12:41.903
Burned our backers.

12:41.938 --> 12:43.271
- Fuck.
-  Ugh, man.

12:43.323 --> 12:44.606
That sucks.

12:44.658 --> 12:47.158
Dushkin Party Ship, it
was a hell of an idea.

12:47.193 --> 12:48.017
- Fuck.
- I would've gone on

12:48.042 --> 12:48.910
that thing in a second.

12:48.945 --> 12:49.699
Fuck!

12:49.847 --> 12:50.663
Double fuck.

12:50.803 --> 12:53.364
- We're gonna think about this.
- Really?

12:53.416 --> 12:54.699
Sorry, guys.

12:54.751 --> 12:56.311
Put some pants on, have a think.

12:59.839 --> 13:03.174
And now we wait.

13:20.844 --> 13:22.477
Nice elbow.

13:22.529 --> 13:24.294
We need to talk about my exit strategy.

13:24.413 --> 13:26.781
Your exit strategy?

13:26.816 --> 13:27.782
Yeah.

13:27.817 --> 13:29.200
I got no incentive to stay.

13:29.235 --> 13:31.569
And I'm fucked at K and
A if Skip takes over.

13:31.621 --> 13:33.655
Check ball, all right?

13:39.310 --> 13:41.690
You know you should've made me
partner a long fucking time ago.

13:41.691 --> 13:43.631
- Jesus Christ.
- I worked my fucking ass off for you.

13:43.667 --> 13:45.427
Yeah, and we paid you
for that, right, Clyde?

13:45.468 --> 13:46.668
You know what your problem is?

13:46.720 --> 13:48.469
Oh, this ought to be beautiful.

13:48.505 --> 13:50.505
What's my problem, buddy? Hmm?

13:50.557 --> 13:52.924
You made up your mind about
me a long fucking time ago.

13:52.976 --> 13:54.444
Doesn't matter what I do, doesn't matter

13:54.445 --> 13:57.729
how much I fucking grow,
that's never gonna change.

13:57.764 --> 13:59.681
- Got you.
- Yeah.

13:59.733 --> 14:01.911
Well, guess what, you
whining about it like a little bitch,

14:01.912 --> 14:04.018
is that supposed to show
me how much you've matured?

14:04.070 --> 14:06.351
- I'm not fucking whining.
- Then what are you doing, Clyde?

14:06.356 --> 14:09.574
Fine, can we talk about my
severance package or not?

14:11.327 --> 14:14.112
Yeah. When we get back to
the office, all right?

14:21.504 --> 14:24.122
They will figure this
out eventually, right?

14:24.174 --> 14:25.790
Oh, yeah, they'll put it together.

14:25.842 --> 14:27.125
It's a simple solution.

14:27.177 --> 14:29.794
Yeah, but they're pretty simpleminded.

14:29.846 --> 14:31.796
Yeah, that's true.

14:31.848 --> 14:33.798
- There he is!
-  Hey!

14:33.850 --> 14:35.313
Where have you been, Clyde?

14:35.314 --> 14:37.802
Why is there soot all
over your jacket? Oh.

14:37.854 --> 14:39.137
Huh.

14:39.189 --> 14:40.972
That is fucking weird.

14:41.024 --> 14:42.726
Okay, very good.

14:42.842 --> 14:43.960
Showing up late.

14:44.114 --> 14:46.811
The soot from the engine
room on your jacket.

14:46.863 --> 14:48.479
Oh, I get it.

14:48.531 --> 14:49.530
What do you get?

14:49.566 --> 14:50.916
Well, he's trying to make me think

14:50.917 --> 14:54.318
that he fucked the captain, but
I know that didn't happen.

14:54.370 --> 14:56.487
Oh, he's right, I didn't.

14:56.539 --> 14:58.489
So you're denying it.

14:58.541 --> 15:00.158
I am. I am.

15:00.210 --> 15:01.159
Ugh.

15:01.211 --> 15:02.744
Then where'd the soot come from?!

15:02.796 --> 15:03.848
- Why are you late?!
- Hey.

15:03.849 --> 15:04.835
Are you fucking with me right now?!

15:04.860 --> 15:05.188
Doug.

15:05.215 --> 15:06.132
- Doug.
- Well-well, denying it

15:06.133 --> 15:08.716
makes me think he really
did, when he actually didn't.

15:08.752 --> 15:10.384
- That makes sense.
- Yeah, smart.

15:10.420 --> 15:12.386
You didn't fuck the captain.

15:12.422 --> 15:14.129
No, I didn't fuck the captain.

15:14.335 --> 15:16.674
Oh, fuck you, Clyde!

15:16.726 --> 15:18.926
Okay, here we go. You watching that?

15:18.978 --> 15:21.429
See the tumblers, they're
starting to line up.

15:21.481 --> 15:23.264
They put it together. That's it, boys.

15:23.316 --> 15:25.650
Now do a celebratory chest bump!

15:27.187 --> 15:28.102
Yaga!

15:28.154 --> 15:29.403
- Marty!
-  Over here!

15:29.439 --> 15:30.238
Fellas!

15:30.273 --> 15:31.239
Yes!

15:31.274 --> 15:33.908
We have got an idea.

15:33.943 --> 15:35.189
What? Hello, focus.

15:35.190 --> 15:37.361
Uh, instead of us
putting up the money to run a ship...

15:37.413 --> 15:38.830
Palace Cruises gives us one to run.

15:38.865 --> 15:40.198
Oh, my God.

15:40.250 --> 15:41.783
Wow, that is a great idea,

15:41.835 --> 15:43.417
but I do see one small problem.

15:43.453 --> 15:45.286
Yeah, the-the CEO hates you guys.

15:45.338 --> 15:46.704
Yeah, he hates you guys.

15:46.756 --> 15:48.492
He's got a real stick up his ass

15:48.613 --> 15:50.208
about the rider in your contract.

15:50.260 --> 15:52.343
Well, Marty, you
should talk to him about that

15:52.378 --> 15:54.262
- and see if maybe you could...
- Loosen the stick?

15:54.297 --> 15:56.714
- Yeah!
- I guess I could try.

15:56.766 --> 15:58.099
Worth a shot.

15:58.134 --> 16:00.134
- Yeah, Marty!
- Yeah, but here's the thing.

16:00.186 --> 16:02.350
In order for this to
have any chance of working,

16:02.351 --> 16:04.037
you're going to have to back down

16:04.038 --> 16:05.690
on all those demands in that rider.

16:05.725 --> 16:06.691
No.

16:06.726 --> 16:08.265
You got to do it, guys.

16:08.389 --> 16:09.894
All of them?

16:09.946 --> 16:12.626
Listen, it's that or no ship, okay?

16:12.767 --> 16:14.232
Your call.

16:14.284 --> 16:15.764
- The rider, the ship...
- That's tough.

16:15.785 --> 16:16.734
Think it over.

16:16.786 --> 16:18.369
Very smart.

16:21.574 --> 16:23.457
- Fuck it.
- Fuck it.

16:23.493 --> 16:25.159
Rider demands rescinded.

16:25.211 --> 16:26.639
- Wow.
- Okay, then.

16:26.640 --> 16:28.913
We're gonna bust our ass and
try to get you guys a ship.

16:28.965 --> 16:30.414
- Fuck yeah!
- Yes!

16:30.466 --> 16:31.415
All right.

16:31.467 --> 16:33.835
Okay, guys, got a lot of work to do.

16:33.887 --> 16:35.303
- Get out of here.
- Crunch some numbers.

16:35.338 --> 16:36.554
- We'll be in touch.
- Yeah!

16:36.589 --> 16:38.222
I think that went great.

16:38.258 --> 16:40.141
Yeah. I feel like a
little bit of a clap.

16:40.176 --> 16:41.259
- Shots?!
- Shots!

16:41.311 --> 16:42.393
- Shots.
-  Yeah.

16:42.428 --> 16:43.895
Shots!

16:43.930 --> 16:45.847
Shots, shots, shots.

16:48.902 --> 16:50.768
- No, no, no, no, no.
-  Hit it again.

17:01.664 --> 17:03.281
- I got to dance it off!
- Oh!

17:12.675 --> 17:14.625
I'm king of the ship!

17:14.676 --> 17:16.544
That's not the line, asshole!

17:16.596 --> 17:18.546
I fucking deserve a partnership, Marty.

17:18.598 --> 17:19.602
You know that!

17:19.720 --> 17:21.015
You "deserve" it?

17:21.050 --> 17:22.266
I do fucking deserve it.

17:22.301 --> 17:23.467
- Guys, guys...
- Yes!

17:23.469 --> 17:24.635
Do you know what the
word "deserve" means?

17:24.637 --> 17:25.803
- Guys...
-  Yes, I do!

17:25.805 --> 17:27.137
It means you fucking earned it.

17:27.140 --> 17:28.556
- Fuck you!
- Aw...

17:28.608 --> 17:30.274
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you!

17:30.310 --> 17:31.475
Fuck you, Clyde.

17:31.527 --> 17:32.944
- Fuck you, you piece of shit!
- You guys suck!

17:32.979 --> 17:34.812
Such a buzz kill.

17:34.814 --> 17:36.781
- Bye, Jeannie.
- Let me be who I'm supposed

17:36.816 --> 17:38.065
- to fucking be!
- Oh!

17:38.117 --> 17:39.277
I should be up where you are.

17:39.285 --> 17:40.451
Should I call the wambulance?

17:40.486 --> 17:41.652
- Yeah, call the wambulance.
- Here it comes.

17:41.654 --> 17:42.737
- See what happens.
-  Wah-oh!

17:42.789 --> 17:45.289
Wah-oh! Wah-oh! Wah-oh! Wah-oh!

17:49.579 --> 17:51.162
I fucked you, man.

17:51.214 --> 17:52.797
- No. No.
- I did.

17:52.832 --> 17:54.548
- No, Clyde, I'm sorry, man.
- You know what I would've done

17:54.584 --> 17:56.217
- if Skip gave me that offer?
- What?

17:56.252 --> 17:58.169
The same exact thing
that you fucking did.

17:58.221 --> 17:59.637
Ah.

17:59.672 --> 18:02.006
Dude, you are my favorite work son.

18:02.058 --> 18:04.258
I love you. Just don't tell blah.

18:04.310 --> 18:05.593
- I'm not gonna tell the...
- What?

18:05.645 --> 18:07.061
- What?
- I love you, too, Marty!

18:07.096 --> 18:08.813
- Come on, man.
-  Marty!

18:08.848 --> 18:09.764
Guys!

18:11.017 --> 18:13.651
I got to pump and dump.

18:14.687 --> 18:15.686
- Ah!
- Oh!

18:15.688 --> 18:16.938
That's my girl.

18:28.534 --> 18:29.617
No.

18:29.669 --> 18:30.618
Hello.

18:30.670 --> 18:31.836
Sweet potato fries!

18:31.871 --> 18:33.704
Ew, ew, ew, ew!

18:33.706 --> 18:35.706
There's no booze here.

18:35.758 --> 18:38.489
Hey, you know what has
high... a high alcohol content?

18:38.604 --> 18:42.179
What has high alcohol content?

18:42.215 --> 18:43.180
What?

18:43.216 --> 18:44.265
I dare you.

18:44.300 --> 18:45.516
Oh, you fucking dare me?

18:45.551 --> 18:46.851
- I da...
- You fucking dare me?

18:46.886 --> 18:48.861
What are you guys talking about?

18:52.058 --> 18:53.140
What?

18:53.192 --> 18:54.308
What?

18:54.360 --> 18:55.810
- Drink that baby food!
- Chug, chug, chug!

18:55.862 --> 18:58.145
- Baby! Ba... No, come on, Clyde!
- Drink that baby food!

18:58.197 --> 19:00.064
- Drink that baby food!
- Chug, chug!

19:00.066 --> 19:02.700
- Chug, chug, chug! No, Clyde!
- Drink that... Yes! Yes!

19:02.735 --> 19:04.618
Goddamn it! You fucking asshole!

19:04.654 --> 19:05.619
Yes!

19:05.655 --> 19:06.821
God, the suspense is killing me.

19:06.873 --> 19:08.289
Stay, stay, stay.

19:08.324 --> 19:09.290
Ready?

19:09.325 --> 19:10.574
Okay!

19:10.576 --> 19:13.744
Look under your chairs!

19:16.082 --> 19:17.048
Oh, what is it?

19:17.083 --> 19:18.485
That's right!

19:18.486 --> 19:19.667
You get a partnership!

19:19.719 --> 19:21.385
- And you get a partnership!
- No.

19:21.421 --> 19:22.670
No way!

19:22.722 --> 19:24.755
Are you serious?!

19:24.757 --> 19:25.890
- Marty!
- Marty!

19:25.925 --> 19:27.808
Marty, I love you! This is unbelievable!

19:29.595 --> 19:31.479
We did it!

19:36.519 --> 19:37.985
Oh, shit.

19:38.021 --> 19:39.153
I'm late.

19:39.188 --> 19:40.571
I'll see you guys tomorrow, all right?

19:41.908 --> 19:43.524
Nice try, Clyde.

19:43.576 --> 19:45.326
I'm still not falling
for it.

19:45.361 --> 19:47.495
Hey, be careful, buddy.

19:47.530 --> 19:48.881
Yeah, right.

19:49.181 --> 19:51.615
You know something?

19:51.667 --> 19:55.669
We're... really, really good at life.

19:55.705 --> 19:57.505
- Yep.
- Like, we...

19:57.540 --> 19:59.662
we have this
business we're about to sell

19:59.798 --> 20:02.009
for some serious "fuck you" money.

20:02.045 --> 20:03.844
Oh, my God, serious money.

20:03.880 --> 20:06.130
And we have a kid, Marty!

20:06.132 --> 20:09.300
We have a beautiful, amazing...

20:09.302 --> 20:11.385
And she's so well-adjusted.

20:11.437 --> 20:14.305
She's-she's five months
old, but I like your optimism.

20:14.307 --> 20:17.641
And, yeah, it sucks that
we have to travel so much

20:17.693 --> 20:20.227
d-during these formative
months, but that's gonna change.

20:20.279 --> 20:22.313
And that builds character.

20:22.365 --> 20:24.482
It's a character builder.

20:24.534 --> 20:26.157
I mean, we are

20:26.279 --> 20:28.652
killing it as parents!

20:28.654 --> 20:30.204
I agree!

20:30.239 --> 20:31.496
Killing it!

20:34.994 --> 20:36.327
That's what I'm saying.

20:36.379 --> 20:37.486
Yeah.

20:43.772 --> 20:45.886
What's going on?

20:45.922 --> 20:47.671
What happened? You're changing.

20:47.723 --> 20:48.672
Oh, no, don't cry.

20:48.724 --> 20:50.091
Jeannie, don't-don't cry.

20:50.143 --> 20:51.926
We were just killing
it. We just had fun.

20:51.978 --> 20:53.761
Don't cry, Jeannie.

20:53.813 --> 20:56.180
Yeah, don't cry, Jeannie.

20:57.650 --> 21:01.102
What if we're not killing
it as parents, Marty?

21:01.154 --> 21:03.154
We just said we're killing it.

21:03.189 --> 21:05.272
I love her so much!

21:05.324 --> 21:06.941
I know. I know.

21:06.993 --> 21:08.109
Okay, come on.

21:08.161 --> 21:10.111
Oh, my God.

21:10.163 --> 21:12.663
Tell the captain to
stop driving in circles.

21:17.420 --> 21:18.702
What are you doing?

21:18.754 --> 21:20.454
I'm calling our baby.

21:20.506 --> 21:23.124
Jeannie, don't do that.

21:23.176 --> 21:25.626
You're drunk, okay?

21:25.678 --> 21:27.878
It's gonna come off as desperate.

21:27.930 --> 21:28.963
Jeannie?

21:29.015 --> 21:30.431
I want to talk to my baby.

21:30.466 --> 21:31.432
What time is it?

21:31.467 --> 21:32.766
Just fucking put her on.

21:32.802 --> 21:33.884
Come on. It's the nanny. "Please."

21:33.936 --> 21:35.302
Just fucking put her on, please.

21:35.354 --> 21:37.438
There you go.

21:39.058 --> 21:41.525
Hi, bun.

21:41.561 --> 21:42.526
Hey, boo-boo.

21:42.562 --> 21:44.395
How you doing, bunny?

21:44.447 --> 21:45.529
What are you doing?

21:45.565 --> 21:47.314
What are you doing?

21:47.366 --> 21:48.983
Can you say hi to Mom and Daddy?

21:49.035 --> 21:50.201
Hi, bunny. We miss you.

21:50.236 --> 21:52.369
Hi, mama. We miss you.

21:52.405 --> 21:53.704
Yeah.

21:53.739 --> 21:56.113
Oh, my God, look at her.

21:57.132 --> 21:59.960
She's getting so big.

22:02.665 --> 22:04.498
Don't.

22:04.550 --> 22:06.167
You're getting so big!

22:15.061 --> 22:16.065
Love you.

22:22.435 --> 22:24.401
Hey.

22:24.437 --> 22:26.237
Some night, huh?

22:26.272 --> 22:27.521
Oh, hey.

22:27.573 --> 22:28.856
What are you doing here?

22:28.908 --> 22:30.658
It's me, Doug.

22:30.693 --> 22:33.494
Cleat hitch.

22:36.115 --> 22:37.281
I knew it.

22:37.283 --> 22:38.582
I'm sorry?

22:38.618 --> 22:40.451
Listen, Cap, uh...

22:40.453 --> 22:43.120
I know we've been
doing this little dance,

22:43.122 --> 22:45.839
but, uh, I head back to L.A.

22:45.875 --> 22:48.425
tomorrow, and...

22:48.461 --> 22:50.544
I guess what I'm saying is,

22:50.596 --> 22:53.047
I'm just a boy standing in
front of a ship captain...

22:53.099 --> 22:55.599
Okay. You need to go
back to your stateroom.

22:55.635 --> 22:56.450
Hey. Hey, hey.

22:56.601 --> 22:58.281
It's wildly
inappropriate that you're here.

22:58.304 --> 23:00.137
Oh, I see.

23:00.139 --> 23:02.773
But if Clyde were here, it'd
be wildly appropriate, right?

23:02.808 --> 23:04.475
Who is Clyde?

23:04.477 --> 23:06.143
"Who's Clyde?"

23:06.145 --> 23:08.362
Like you don't know good
old "engine room" Clyde.

23:08.397 --> 23:09.947
You two...

23:09.982 --> 23:11.693
peas in a fucking pod.

23:12.972 --> 23:14.868
He's here now, isn't he?

23:14.904 --> 23:16.453
- I'm calling security.
- Whoa.

23:16.489 --> 23:19.323
Okay, hey! Okay, okay, fine.

23:22.161 --> 23:24.161
J'accuse!

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
I knew it.

23:35.258 --> 23:37.258
Hey.

23:37.310 --> 23:38.225
Who you calling?

23:38.261 --> 23:39.226
Security,

23:39.262 --> 23:40.261
Captain Dunleavy.

23:40.313 --> 23:42.012
So cool.

23:42.064 --> 23:42.763
Hurry.

23:42.815 --> 23:45.766
I'm the captain now.

23:47.853 --> 23:50.354
Marty?

23:50.406 --> 23:52.156
Hmm?

23:52.191 --> 23:53.440
Did we have sex?

23:53.492 --> 23:54.775
Didn't.

23:57.029 --> 23:59.196
Marty?

23:59.248 --> 24:00.197
Hmm?

24:00.249 --> 24:03.584
Did we drunk-dial our baby last night?

24:03.619 --> 24:05.369
Did.

24:06.422 --> 24:08.338
Oh, no.

24:09.052 --> 24:11.709
Don't worry, mama.

24:11.761 --> 24:13.877
We are still fucking killing it.

24:13.879 --> 24:14.878
Yeah.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.982
We're killing it. Hmm.

24:17.130 --> 24:19.383
We'll be
docking at our first port of call

24:19.385 --> 24:21.468
in approximately ten minutes.

24:21.520 --> 24:23.854
Welcome to Cabo San Lucas.

24:27.143 --> 24:30.394
So... how do you
think it's going over there?

24:30.446 --> 24:31.612
Know what?

24:31.647 --> 24:33.647
If anyone can get it done, it's Marty.

24:33.699 --> 24:35.532
Yeah. Yeah, he can.

24:38.821 --> 24:40.537
Wasn't cream, it was ice cream.

24:40.573 --> 24:42.489
But I'm gonna tell
you just like I told him...

24:42.541 --> 24:44.325
Look at him, he's going for it.

24:44.377 --> 24:45.326
Come on, Marty.

24:46.245 --> 24:48.662
Got to try the sorbet!

24:48.714 --> 24:51.382
Well, I-I'm really glad that
you enjoyed our dessert bar so much.

24:51.417 --> 24:53.917
You're goddamn right I did, Patrick.

24:53.919 --> 24:56.253
It's a fucking home run.

24:56.255 --> 24:57.971
What's happening?

25:01.010 --> 25:02.843
Any luck with the Dushkins?

25:02.895 --> 25:04.345
Well, the Dushkins.

25:04.397 --> 25:05.979
They're gonna run a boat for you.

25:06.015 --> 25:06.851
Ah.

25:06.852 --> 25:09.316
And they have agreed
to forgo their rider.

25:09.352 --> 25:10.434
Completely?

25:11.771 --> 25:13.153
How on earth did you do that?

25:13.189 --> 25:14.405
Eh.

25:19.745 --> 25:22.663
Looks like you guys got yourself a boat.

25:24.417 --> 25:25.999
- Yes, we did!
- Yeah, we got a fucking boat!

25:26.035 --> 25:27.534
Yes, we did!

25:27.586 --> 25:28.869
Yeah!

25:28.921 --> 25:30.204
Marty fucking Kaan!

25:30.256 --> 25:31.755
Marty fucking Kaan!

25:31.791 --> 25:34.007
Marty Kaan! Marty Kaan!

25:34.043 --> 25:35.292
Where's Doug?

25:40.549 --> 25:41.965
Marty, Jeannie, thank God.

25:42.017 --> 25:43.133
What an ordeal.

25:43.135 --> 25:44.601
I swear to God, if we
miss this fucking plane...

25:44.637 --> 25:45.837
I need a coconut water so bad.

25:45.855 --> 25:46.855
- How did you do it?
- Whoa.

25:46.856 --> 25:48.021
Did you trade cigarettes for things?

25:48.057 --> 25:49.723
- Get away from me.
- For, like, a calculator?

25:49.775 --> 25:50.808
Did you drop the soap?

25:50.810 --> 25:52.526
You know, I went my whole life

25:52.561 --> 25:53.777
without being incarcerated.

25:53.813 --> 25:55.013
- Incarcerated?
- Yeah.

25:55.030 --> 25:57.815
They put you in a room and
demagnetized your key card.

25:57.817 --> 26:00.317
Yeah, thanks to you and
your childish mind games.

26:00.319 --> 26:02.786
Oh, my God, how
did you get through it?

26:02.822 --> 26:06.957
Aren't you glad you
made them both partners?

26:06.992 --> 26:08.409
I did what now?
