29:11.640 --> 29:13.608
Please, come with us.

29:13.760 --> 29:15.285
The cliffs are no safer
than here.

29:15.480 --> 29:17.482
If we leave now,
at least we stand a chance.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.929
It's time for us to go.

We need to hurry.

29:58.600 --> 30:01.126

It's time for you
to lead us out of here.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.687
I'm not coming.

30:06.680 --> 30:09.809

You can't stay here.

30:09.960 --> 30:11.803
This is my life, here.

30:11.960 --> 30:14.281
Your mother and I built this place
with our bare hands.

30:14.440 --> 30:18.001
Her spirit rests here.
This place is sacred too.

30:18.160 --> 30:21.050
It is stronger
than a million zombies!

30:21.200 --> 30:24.522
- What if it's not?
- Then I go down with the ship.

30:26.840 --> 30:28.729
Please don't do this.

30:32.440 --> 30:35.330
Everyone,
it is time for you to go.

30:35.520 --> 30:39.127
It has been an honour to serve
as your tribal chief.

30:39.280 --> 30:42.284
In my absence,
listen to my daughter.

30:43.360 --> 30:45.488
She has known you
all of her life.

30:45.640 --> 30:48.689
And she holds a wisdom
that is beyond her years.

30:48.840 --> 30:50.410

30:52.280 --> 30:55.841

as far as we can take them

31:29.440 --> 31:31.283
