WEBVTT

00:00.520 --> 00:01.120
Uh, Greg.
Don't worry, put it on your tab.

00:01.159 --> 00:02.399
OK.

00:04.040 --> 00:07.120
Coming through, lads.
Coming through, ladies.

00:07.160 --> 00:08.279
Ruby!

00:09.359 --> 00:11.119
Getting warm.

00:11.160 --> 00:14.199
Warmer.
Thanks.

00:14.240 --> 00:16.920
You know,
they're always slightly warm.

00:16.960 --> 00:20.079
I think it's because he's English.

00:20.120 --> 00:23.120
Yeah, probably.
Yeah.

00:24.960 --> 00:29.199
You know, it's OK, if you want to...

00:29.239 --> 00:33.280
If I want to...?
I don't know.

00:33.320 --> 00:37.840
Share? Scream? Swear?

00:37.880 --> 00:39.840
Anything beginning with "S" is fine.

00:39.880 --> 00:42.280
Thank you, but I'm fine.

00:44.240 --> 00:47.920
I'm over it. Over him.

00:52.759 --> 00:56.960
I was always going to get over it
at some point. Eventually.

00:58.200 --> 01:02.359
So I thought... why wait?

01:02.399 --> 01:04.120
Why not just be over it?

01:04.159 --> 01:06.319
So I did.

01:06.359 --> 01:08.680
Am?

01:08.719 --> 01:12.040
I am over it.

01:12.079 --> 01:17.959
OK. So that sounds very... logical.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.239
Yeah. I thought so.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.079
Mari!

01:23.120 --> 01:24.719
Ruby!

01:27.439 --> 01:30.319
Oh, God. Come on.
No.  Yeah!

01:30.359 --> 01:32.879
Ugh.  Yes.
MARI LAUGHS

01:34.840 --> 01:37.480
You know,
she still won't talk about him.

01:37.519 --> 01:39.799
Give her time.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.719
Do you think men
are fundamentally unreliable?

01:42.760 --> 01:44.079
Or is it learned behaviour?

01:44.120 --> 01:45.560
Personally, I think

01:45.599 --> 01:48.599
the masculine fear of commitment
is a little like gravity.

01:49.640 --> 01:51.599
Ever present, totally invisible,

01:51.640 --> 01:53.959
and liable to drag you down
at any minute.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.760
Blimey. That's almost profound.

03:00.319 --> 03:03.039
CHILDREN SCREAM AND LAUGH

03:12.960 --> 03:16.400
CHILDREN CHATTER

03:24.240 --> 03:27.479
Good morning, everyone.
Trust we all slept well?

03:27.520 --> 03:28.680
HE COUGHS

03:30.520 --> 03:32.439
Looking a little seedy, Dr Nair.

03:32.479 --> 03:35.039
Clearly didn't get the memo
about the house special.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.520
Thank you for your concern.

03:36.560 --> 03:39.159
But I think I'll be all right,
provided I neither move nor speak.

03:39.199 --> 03:41.560
Physician, heal thyself.
Right, to business.

03:41.599 --> 03:43.960
KNOCK AT DOOR
Good morning.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.159
I'm looking for Dr Nair.
His office is empty.  And you are?

03:47.199 --> 03:48.960
Dr Nikita Sharma.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.639
I'm your new junior colleague,
but everyone calls me Niki.

03:51.680 --> 03:53.080
No, no, no, no, no.

03:53.120 --> 03:56.560
You were supposed to arrive
only on the 24th.

03:56.599 --> 03:58.560
Which, of course, is today.

04:00.199 --> 04:02.879
Yes. Yes. So, Lydia,

04:02.919 --> 04:06.400
as you know, my son Ajay
has returned to his medical studies,

04:06.439 --> 04:09.120
but by good fortune, I've been able
to secure the services

04:09.159 --> 04:11.560
of an excellent
junior trainee doctor.

04:13.319 --> 04:15.840
Welcome, Dr Sharma.
My name is Lydia Fonseca.

04:15.879 --> 04:16.920
I'm sure the rest of my team

04:16.959 --> 04:19.120
will introduce themselves
to you individually,

04:19.160 --> 04:20.519
after we complete morning report.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.199
Can I just say...
To business.

04:22.240 --> 04:24.480
Unless anyone else
has a surprise in store for me?

04:27.040 --> 04:29.240
Right, Amir Khan, over in Anapuri.

04:29.279 --> 04:31.439
The biopsy results
came through yesterday.

04:31.480 --> 04:35.519
Unfortunately, suspected laryngeal
carcinoma has been confirmed.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.680
But no local spread, so hopefully,

04:37.720 --> 04:39.920
a little localised radiotherapy
will see him through.

04:39.959 --> 04:42.759
I thought, as you made the diagnosis
in good time,

04:42.800 --> 04:45.680
you could pop over
and give him the news.  Sure.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.959
And why don't you take Dr Sharma...
Sharma.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.199
Despite my wizened appearance,
Doctor,

04:52.240 --> 04:54.399
I still have a fully functioning
short-term memory.

04:54.439 --> 04:58.759
Dr Walker, I've had your request for
an urgent consultation in Yuvenam.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.959
A sick child,
details are a little sketchy,

05:01.000 --> 05:02.680
so I thought a visit
would be appropriate.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.639
Give your motorbike a run-out.
No problem.

05:04.680 --> 05:05.839
Didn't think there would be.

05:05.879 --> 05:08.399
Sister Mari, you're in maternity,
yours truly in admissions.

05:08.439 --> 05:10.879
Thank you, everyone,
our patients are waiting.

05:11.879 --> 05:12.959
Not you.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.480
Lydia, I'm so sorry,

05:16.519 --> 05:19.079
it was just an admin error
on my part.

05:19.120 --> 05:21.240
I don't like fait accompli, Dr Nair,

05:21.279 --> 05:24.040
especially when it comes
to my staff. Who the hell is she?

05:25.399 --> 05:27.120
You know, my friend, Jasprit,

05:27.160 --> 05:31.519
was in orthopaedic practice
in Kochi. Niki is his daughter.

05:31.560 --> 05:35.759
And Jasprit feels that she should
see some actual medicine

05:35.800 --> 05:39.120
before she specialises. You know,
real-life experience, so to speak.

05:41.279 --> 05:43.720
Fine. I don't have the energy
to argue.

05:43.759 --> 05:45.560
But she's your responsibility,
not mine.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.319
Totally, totally.

05:48.839 --> 05:50.639
By the way,
have we heard from Dr Verma?

05:52.199 --> 05:55.399
Arrived yesterday.
Official resignation letter.

05:56.439 --> 05:59.920
Then what do we do? We ask Kochi
for a replacement surgeon?

05:59.959 --> 06:01.399
After the year we've had?

06:01.439 --> 06:04.079
Fresh surgeons are like hen's teeth.
No, no.

06:04.120 --> 06:07.040
As usual, we'll just
have to muddle through on our own.

06:07.079 --> 06:08.759
Well, that we can do.

06:10.040 --> 06:12.639
And have you talked to Dr Walker
about this?

06:12.680 --> 06:14.560
No, not yet. But I will.

06:42.279 --> 06:44.800
Agh!

06:48.600 --> 06:50.519
Oh, come on!

06:56.800 --> 06:59.240
Hi.
Ruby.

06:59.279 --> 07:01.399
Oh.

07:01.439 --> 07:06.560
Samir. I work for...
DCO. Somehow, I got that.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.000
Do you need a hand?

07:09.040 --> 07:12.439
Yeah, it just cut out on me. I'm
assuming it's something technical?

07:12.480 --> 07:14.959
Yeah. I think it's a pretty safe
bet. You tried calling the AA?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.519
Really? They work out here?
I didn't know that...

07:18.560 --> 07:20.920
Wow. You really are
fresh off the boat.

07:23.439 --> 07:25.839
So, what are you doing here?

07:25.879 --> 07:28.360
Doctor. For GKH.

07:28.399 --> 07:29.920
I need a torch.

07:35.120 --> 07:38.319
GKH? I don't think I've heard
of that one. Is it a non-profit?

07:38.360 --> 07:40.639
Good Karma Hospital. Over in Barco.

07:40.680 --> 07:43.600
Small, but perfectly formed.
Can you hold this?

07:43.639 --> 07:45.560
Yes.
Point it there.

07:47.720 --> 07:49.959
Look, I'm really grateful
for the help,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.360
but my control are sending
a mechanic as soon as they can...

07:52.399 --> 07:53.720
OK. Try it now.

07:54.920 --> 07:57.240
Bumpy roads mean electrical
connections work loose.

07:57.279 --> 07:58.720
It's pretty simple, really.

08:11.560 --> 08:13.839
ENGINE STARTS

08:13.879 --> 08:15.439
Oh.

08:15.480 --> 08:17.439
Thanks. I owe you one.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.480
Welcome to India.

08:23.600 --> 08:26.240
Hey! Wait! No!

08:30.639 --> 08:33.360
OK, so, that was a pretty dumb place
to leave it...  I was helping you.

08:33.399 --> 08:35.879
Parking in someone's blind spot
isn't exactly helpful.

08:35.919 --> 08:37.279
Hello! Mirrors, one on each side.

08:37.320 --> 08:39.120
It was obvious
I was gonna pull back!

08:45.159 --> 08:47.000
So, what do we do now?

08:55.279 --> 08:57.639
I don't think I should
really be doing this.  Tough.

08:58.960 --> 09:02.279
I have my own schedule, and...
You killed my bike.

09:02.320 --> 09:05.200
Indian traffic law gives me the
right to commandeer your vehicle.

09:07.360 --> 09:09.080
Is that true?

09:09.120 --> 09:10.559
Probably.

09:12.639 --> 09:15.519
So, where are we going?
I'll tell you when we get there.

09:18.159 --> 09:19.600
Dr Fonseca?

09:23.159 --> 09:25.840
I wondered if I could
have a few minutes of your time.

09:25.879 --> 09:30.440
My name is Hira Grover,
and I am your local politician.

09:30.480 --> 09:31.600
Since my election,

09:31.639 --> 09:34.279
I've been touring all
the public hospitals in the area,

09:34.320 --> 09:36.080
just to see how we can help.

09:36.120 --> 09:37.399
We're honoured.

09:37.440 --> 09:39.919
Although, I did think
there'd be more of an entourage.

09:39.960 --> 09:42.240
Fresh paint, Dr Fonseca.

09:42.279 --> 09:44.440
A queen thinks the world
smells of it,

09:44.480 --> 09:46.960
but I need to see things
as they really are.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.120
And today's our lucky day?

09:49.159 --> 09:51.879
I want to be a politician
who keeps her promises.

09:51.919 --> 09:53.480
I'm a doctor, too, you know.

09:53.519 --> 09:56.000
Oh, yeah,
the Grove Clinic chain, right?

09:56.039 --> 09:58.279
They say
you're worth a small fortune.

09:59.480 --> 10:01.720
I was lucky enough to have success
with my business,

10:01.759 --> 10:05.440
but now I want to
give something back to my community.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.600
Tell me what you need.

10:07.639 --> 10:08.799
Just the usual.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.559
Money, more staff, new buildings,
equipment, the works.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.000
Feel free to stop me any time.

10:13.039 --> 10:15.799
What you do here is incredible.

10:15.840 --> 10:18.200
And I sincerely want to help.

10:19.559 --> 10:21.000
OK.

10:21.039 --> 10:23.279
You asked for it. This way.

10:29.679 --> 10:30.960
Dr Nair!

10:33.480 --> 10:35.840
Dr Nair. Found you.

10:35.879 --> 10:38.799
Can I just say, I am so sorry
if I embarrassed you,

10:38.840 --> 10:41.080
but I am 100% certain
today is the correct date.

10:41.120 --> 10:43.879
In fact, I rechecked the email
chain, and I can absolutely confirm

10:43.919 --> 10:47.000
I'm supposed to be here. Now.
Which... I am.

10:49.159 --> 10:53.440
Dr Sharma... when you get to my age,

10:53.480 --> 10:56.279
you start to accept that,
ultimately,

10:56.320 --> 10:57.840
everything is your own fault...

10:59.440 --> 11:02.639
..and the only cure
is the sweet release of eternity.

11:06.960 --> 11:10.000
I'm sorry, I...
I don't know how to respond.

11:11.720 --> 11:14.879
Do you have a car?
Yes.

11:14.919 --> 11:16.559
Then please lead me to it.

11:19.320 --> 11:19.639
'is arriving on platform one.'

11:56.480 --> 11:59.240
How's that for service?
Thank you.

11:59.279 --> 12:00.559
Absolute pleasure.

12:03.919 --> 12:06.039
Excuse me. Do you speak English?

12:06.080 --> 12:07.960
Like a native. How can I help?

12:09.200 --> 12:12.519
Er... I'm looking
for the owner of this place?

12:12.559 --> 12:14.960
He was supposed to meet us there?

12:15.000 --> 12:18.480
"Karnataka Sunshine Apartments.
Best On The Beach."

12:18.519 --> 12:21.879
Which means you want Deepak,
although... I would put 'em third.

12:21.919 --> 12:25.000
I'm sorry?
The apartments.

12:25.039 --> 12:28.679
Definitely third best on the beach,
in my humble opinion.

12:28.720 --> 12:32.480
On the bright side,
bronze is still a medal. I'm Greg.

12:34.240 --> 12:37.799
Frankie. Frankie Martin.
This is my son. Bobby!

12:37.840 --> 12:40.720
Bobby!
SHUTTER CLICKS

12:40.759 --> 12:43.240
OK, so, where can
we find this Deepak character?

12:43.279 --> 12:47.240
Well, let's see, it's Wednesday,
so he will be at the cash-and-carry,

12:47.279 --> 12:50.279
buying more of those chocolates
that you put on the pillows.

12:50.320 --> 12:53.639
After that,
he usually has a drink with Axar,

12:53.679 --> 12:57.039
except on the first of the month
when he goes to see his therapist.

12:57.080 --> 13:00.360
But you're very welcome to wait here
until he returns.

13:02.279 --> 13:04.840
OK. So, how long will that be?

13:04.879 --> 13:09.519
Probably...
about two large gin and tonics?

13:11.440 --> 13:14.519
I'll have one. Let's start with one,
how about that?!

13:14.559 --> 13:16.039
Of course you will.

13:18.559 --> 13:21.399
So, all this is just a normal day?

13:21.440 --> 13:23.559
This? This is nothing.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.960
We average just under
800 patients a week.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.279
Emergencies, follow-up, maternity.

13:28.320 --> 13:31.240
That's incredible... and shocking.

13:31.279 --> 13:33.960
Well, people can't afford the kind
of medicine your clinics offer,

13:34.000 --> 13:37.320
so they come here.
That I can see.

13:37.360 --> 13:39.000
I don't know how you manage.

13:39.039 --> 13:40.799
Hard work and good medicine.

13:40.840 --> 13:42.799
But if we had extra staff
and equipment,

13:42.840 --> 13:44.679
we could do so much more.

13:44.720 --> 13:46.879
And now, I'm afraid
I have to go to a clinic,

13:46.919 --> 13:49.960
so if you'll excuse me.
Sister Mari? Yes, Doctor?

13:50.000 --> 13:52.519
Please could you show Dr Grover
around the rest of the hospital?

13:52.559 --> 13:54.399
She's keen to see everything
that we do here?

13:54.440 --> 13:56.639
Of course. All of it?

13:56.679 --> 13:58.559
Oh, yes. Leave no stone unturned.

13:58.600 --> 14:02.240
I want her to see how exactly
how deserving we really are.

14:02.279 --> 14:03.559
You're in excellent hands.

14:05.279 --> 14:07.879
Oh.
Dr Grover, this way.

14:10.840 --> 14:14.080
SATNAV: 'In 100m, take the next
turning on your left.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.120
'Not long to go now.

14:16.159 --> 14:18.879
'Don't forget our little saying...
MSM.

14:18.919 --> 14:22.440
'Say it with me -
mirror, signal, manoeuvre.

14:22.480 --> 14:25.519
'OK, my darling, you have
arrived at your destination.

14:25.559 --> 14:29.840
'Remember to turn the lights off.
I love you.'

14:29.879 --> 14:32.840
I've been meaning to ask,
is that Jasprit?

14:32.879 --> 14:36.200
Daddy insisted on programming it
when he bought me the car.

14:36.240 --> 14:38.720
I don't think he trusts me.

14:38.759 --> 14:41.000
VOCAL WARM-UP

14:48.360 --> 14:52.080
OK, from your chest and from your
head, but not from your throat, OK?

14:52.120 --> 14:55.840
VOCAL WARM-UP CONTINUES

14:57.480 --> 14:59.480
HE CLEARS THROAT

15:03.799 --> 15:05.919
You play all these instruments?

15:05.960 --> 15:11.960
Guitar, keyboard, bass.
A little saxophone.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.399
Not bad.
And sitar?

15:14.440 --> 15:16.120
What, that? Just decoration.

15:16.159 --> 15:18.360
I'm not George bloody Harrison?

15:18.399 --> 15:21.600
No, this is the real instrument.

15:21.639 --> 15:23.639
My husband is a singer.

15:23.679 --> 15:27.679
Weddings mainly.
Every wedding needs music.

15:27.720 --> 15:30.200
Vital! My show is the best.
All the hits.

15:30.240 --> 15:33.120
If Amir can't get you get up
to dance, you have no legs!

15:33.159 --> 15:35.120
THEY LAUGH

15:35.159 --> 15:37.279
HE SINGS IN HINDI

15:44.799 --> 15:46.039
Sorry, Doctor.

15:46.080 --> 15:49.480
You're here to talk about
the test results?

15:49.519 --> 15:50.840
Yes, yes.

15:50.879 --> 15:55.360
The growth on your larynx
is cancer. I'm sorry.

15:58.440 --> 16:01.320
Is there any treatment? Surgery?

16:01.360 --> 16:04.600
The tests show that
it hasn't spread far, so surgery...

16:04.639 --> 16:07.799
That's good, right?
Very good.

16:07.840 --> 16:11.000
The specialists have recommended
a course of radiation therapy,

16:11.039 --> 16:13.840
and if that treatment goes well,
we can expect a full recovery.

16:16.679 --> 16:18.799
Sorry, Dr Nair. You were speaking.

16:20.159 --> 16:23.519
No, my junior colleague
has given the right prognosis.

16:23.559 --> 16:27.519
With the right kind of medicines,
the outlook is very positive.

16:27.559 --> 16:30.559
Thank you, Doctor.

16:30.600 --> 16:33.120
Our daughter is getting married
in three months' time.

16:34.360 --> 16:38.399
We were both so worried.
You understand?

16:38.440 --> 16:41.000
My sincere congratulations.

16:42.480 --> 16:46.120
Mr Khan, do you have any questions?

16:49.080 --> 16:52.200
This treatment, the radiation...

16:52.240 --> 16:53.639
will it affect my voice?

16:53.679 --> 16:55.799
Possibly.

16:55.840 --> 16:59.879
Some people have complained
of a little hoarseness, maybe.

16:59.919 --> 17:02.679
But the most important thing
is that with this treatment,

17:02.720 --> 17:04.160
we can cure this.

17:05.880 --> 17:09.680
Exactly!
Thank you.

17:10.880 --> 17:15.079
We're both very grateful...
aren't we?

17:15.119 --> 17:18.359
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.

17:25.200 --> 17:26.839
Doctor! Excuse me.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.440
Yeah? Is every OK?

17:28.480 --> 17:31.480
First of all, I want to thank you
for all you have done.

17:31.519 --> 17:33.160
Your care has been quite wonderful.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.880
Really, it's no problem.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.319
Also, today is my first day,
so I haven't really done much.

17:37.359 --> 17:41.759
I have made a decision to delay
this treatment, this radiation,

17:41.799 --> 17:43.400
until after my daughter is married.

17:45.359 --> 17:48.000
I'm sorry, I don't understand?

17:48.039 --> 17:50.359
You see, I promised to sing for her
at her ceremony,

17:50.400 --> 17:53.799
and if there's any chance
that this could affect my voice,

17:53.839 --> 17:55.400
then I can't possibly risk it.

17:55.440 --> 17:59.920
Mr Khan, we have caught
this cancer right in time,

17:59.960 --> 18:04.000
and any delay will allow it
to spread. Each day is vital.

18:04.039 --> 18:07.319
I understand.
But I'm prepared to take this risk.

18:07.359 --> 18:09.559
My daughter's wedding
is more important.

18:09.599 --> 18:11.119
So, you just bring it forward,

18:11.160 --> 18:13.359
next week, I'm sure your daughter
will understand.

18:13.400 --> 18:16.039
Sadly, impossible.
Many arrangements have been made.

18:16.079 --> 18:17.519
Accommodation, catering,

18:17.559 --> 18:20.400
the groom's family are coming
from great distances.

18:20.440 --> 18:23.680
Thank you for your concern,
but my mind is made up.

18:23.720 --> 18:24.839
Does your wife know?

18:27.519 --> 18:30.599
Absolutely not.
And as far as she will know,

18:30.640 --> 18:33.559
I will be continuing this treatment
exactly as planned.

18:33.599 --> 18:38.039
This is my final decision.
All right.

18:41.640 --> 18:42.960
HE SIGHS

18:59.480 --> 19:02.200
Are you sure
this is the right place?

19:02.240 --> 19:04.079
It just looks deserted.

19:21.720 --> 19:24.640
Please come!
My daughter's very sick.

19:26.480 --> 19:29.200
DOG BARKS

19:34.000 --> 19:36.160
How long has she been like this?
Since yesterday.

19:37.720 --> 19:40.480
Her pulse is abnormally slow.

19:40.519 --> 19:42.400
GCS ten, at best.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.200
So we need to move her
to your hospital?

19:44.240 --> 19:46.440
It's not just our daughter,
there are more.

19:46.480 --> 19:48.319
Other people are sick, too.

19:52.519 --> 19:54.880
Just give us a moment.
We'll be right back.

20:00.319 --> 20:02.680
We need to move her.
She'll die without ICU.

20:02.720 --> 20:05.880
The policy says that if
whatever this is is contagious,

20:05.920 --> 20:07.440
we isolate first.

20:07.480 --> 20:09.640
So, you're saying
we should leave her here?

20:10.799 --> 20:14.480
Our duty is to report it and treat
as best we can. We can't move her.

20:14.519 --> 20:16.200
Then she'll die. You know that.

20:19.480 --> 20:20.440
OK. It's all on me. I'll transport
her to the nearest hospital.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.880
Blue tit?
Yes.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.400
Lap... wig?

20:25.680 --> 20:29.960
Lapwig is not a bird,
but if you mean lapwing, then, yes.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
That's what I meant.

20:31.039 --> 20:32.839
I've photographed
every British bird.

20:32.880 --> 20:35.839
They're all on my website
and Instagram.

20:35.880 --> 20:38.079
I have 6,518 followers.

20:38.119 --> 20:41.839
That's incredible.
I never knew birds were so popular.

20:41.880 --> 20:44.480
Ornithology is Britain's
third most popular hobby,

20:44.519 --> 20:45.920
behind jam making and knitting.

20:45.960 --> 20:48.880
It's true. Why else
do you think we're in India?

20:48.920 --> 20:51.880
Excuse me.
That's a blue-faced malkoha.

20:51.920 --> 20:54.079
Don't go far.
OK.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.519
Amazing kid.

20:59.839 --> 21:02.400
I told him
that we could only come to India

21:02.440 --> 21:04.920
if he saved his share
of the plane fare.

21:06.079 --> 21:08.279
I really thought
that would be the end of it,

21:08.319 --> 21:10.119
but he got himself a job
at the pound shop,

21:10.160 --> 21:12.000
spent exactly zero money
for three months,

21:12.039 --> 21:15.319
so he'll go far,
whether we like it or not.

21:15.359 --> 21:16.839
The lad's got focus.

21:16.880 --> 21:19.759
That's all you need
to make it in life.

21:19.799 --> 21:22.279
Never really been my strong suit,
hence...

21:22.319 --> 21:24.720
Focus has never been
Bobby's problem.

21:24.759 --> 21:27.480
If he wants something,
he'll go for it, 100%.

21:27.519 --> 21:30.240
That's a good thing. Right?

21:30.279 --> 21:33.759
Sure. But it can be exhausting.

21:36.160 --> 21:38.079
Bobby's neuro diverse.

21:39.680 --> 21:43.880
Asperger's, ADHD...
it's a complex diagnosis.

21:44.960 --> 21:47.160
Don't get me wrong,
in some ways he's brilliant, but...

21:48.519 --> 21:51.319
..he doesn't see risks, you know?
Always been the same.

21:51.359 --> 21:53.920
One sight of someone he knows,
he'd be straight across the road.

21:53.960 --> 21:55.119
Whoosh!

21:55.160 --> 21:57.319
Then you can relax.

21:57.359 --> 22:00.079
India's entire traffic system
is based on recognising

22:00.119 --> 22:02.680
the fundamental unpredictability
of the individual.

22:02.720 --> 22:05.799
He's never been in safer hands.
SHE CHUCKLES

22:05.839 --> 22:08.480
Speaking of which...
Here comes the man with the keys

22:08.519 --> 22:10.720
to the third-best apartments
on the beach.

22:10.759 --> 22:14.039
SHOUTS: Deepak! Deepak!

22:15.200 --> 22:19.440
Sorry, a bit loud.
It's fine.

22:21.400 --> 22:25.119
It makes no sense.
He's risking his life for a song.

22:26.599 --> 22:29.319
Perhaps we should go back?
Explain things again.

22:29.359 --> 22:30.839
His wife did most of the talking,

22:30.880 --> 22:32.759
could be that he just
simply doesn't get it?

22:32.799 --> 22:36.839
Dr Sharma, it seems to me
that our patient understands

22:36.880 --> 22:38.720
his situation only too well.

22:38.759 --> 22:43.240
And, as he's in full command
of all his faculties,

22:43.279 --> 22:45.119
I think we have no alternative

22:45.160 --> 22:48.319
except
just to give in to his wishes.

22:48.359 --> 22:50.519
Even if he's making
a terrible decision?

22:50.559 --> 22:52.279
Precisely.

22:52.319 --> 22:55.200
Because it's not
your life or my life...

22:57.519 --> 22:59.720
..it is HIS life.

22:59.759 --> 23:02.079
So unless he changes his mind,
we wait.

23:02.119 --> 23:03.839
HORN BLARES

23:11.519 --> 23:13.519
What the hell?

23:13.559 --> 23:15.119
HORN BLARES

23:24.720 --> 23:26.240
Ruby, what's going on?

23:31.599 --> 23:34.200
MOBILE RINGS
Talk to me.

23:34.240 --> 23:35.680
She's infected.

23:35.720 --> 23:37.640
The whole village is sick,
but she's the worst.

23:37.680 --> 23:38.839
Suspected encephalitis.

23:38.880 --> 23:41.039
Started fitting.
Started with IV of diazepam,

23:41.079 --> 23:43.880
but now she's comatose.
Any other symptoms?

23:43.920 --> 23:46.759
Fevers, headaches, myalgia.
Some are vomiting.

23:46.799 --> 23:48.319
Ten cases already, maybe more.

23:48.359 --> 23:51.200
Rash?
None that I can see.

23:51.240 --> 23:52.640
Stay there.

23:55.079 --> 23:57.240
Exactly the same presentation

23:57.279 --> 23:59.440
as Kozhikode and Malappuram
four years ago.

23:59.480 --> 24:02.079
You think this is Nipah virus?
Yes, I'm sure.

24:07.119 --> 24:08.240
MOBILE RINGS

24:08.279 --> 24:11.720
Her pressure's dropping.
I need more fluid.

24:11.759 --> 24:14.480
Normal saline.
I can get some.  Wait.

24:14.519 --> 24:17.759
You do nothing until I tell you to,
understand? Nothing.

24:17.799 --> 24:19.480
They shouldn't help out
the girl here.

24:19.519 --> 24:22.200
The correct procedure
is to isolate the entire village.

24:22.240 --> 24:24.839
The entire area.
However, we are where we are, Ram.

24:24.880 --> 24:28.400
We cannot admit a Nipah patient
in our hospital.

24:28.440 --> 24:31.400
If this thing spreads,
the entire staff, the patients,

24:31.440 --> 24:32.680
everyone is at risk.

24:32.720 --> 24:34.039
I agree with Doctor Nair.

24:34.079 --> 24:35.680
There is no vaccine,
no drugs that work.

24:35.720 --> 24:37.440
Mortality up to 70%
for confirmed cases.

24:37.480 --> 24:40.240
Nothing on Earth scares me more
than this damn virus.

24:40.279 --> 24:42.440
They've already been exposed,
we can't change that.

24:42.480 --> 24:43.519
We have no choice.

24:43.559 --> 24:45.440
We just give them the supplies
they need

24:45.480 --> 24:47.039
and send them back
to the village,

24:47.079 --> 24:48.359
and then call the authorities

24:48.400 --> 24:50.279
and lock it down.
And let the girl die?

24:50.319 --> 24:52.839
Look at her. She needs our help.

24:53.880 --> 24:55.640
She won't get halfway, Lydia.

24:55.680 --> 24:58.319
Sister, I've seen
how this disease spreads.

24:58.359 --> 24:59.599
It's not worth the risk.

24:59.640 --> 25:03.839
If there is an outbreak here, it
doesn't even bear thinking about.

25:03.880 --> 25:06.240
Lydia, please,
you know I'm right on this one.

25:06.279 --> 25:09.079
We have to turn them back right now,
there's no other way.

25:09.119 --> 25:13.319
The girl will die.
They're both young and fit.

25:13.359 --> 25:15.480
Lydia?!

25:15.519 --> 25:18.200
Mari, evacuate the entire hospital.

25:18.240 --> 25:19.680
Everybody else stay away from here

25:19.720 --> 25:21.559
until I work out
what the hell we're gonna do.

25:37.759 --> 25:41.279
So, everyone who can walk
has been discharged.

25:41.319 --> 25:43.200
The inpatients
are all in the main ward,

25:43.240 --> 25:46.480
and we have staff in every entrance
so no-one can get in or out.

25:46.519 --> 25:47.559
OK. Good.

25:51.079 --> 25:53.359
We can use the operating theatre
as a quarantine unit.

25:53.400 --> 25:55.920
There's negative pressure,
we can safely isolate them there.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.599
Lydia...
Let me finish!

25:57.640 --> 25:59.319
They'll work alone with her.

25:59.359 --> 26:01.880
Absolutely none of the staff
will be put at risk.

26:01.920 --> 26:03.319
This is reckless!

26:03.359 --> 26:06.359
I won't stand here and watch
a child die without a fight, Ram.

26:06.400 --> 26:09.759
So, please, just do it, now.
Thank you.

26:09.799 --> 26:10.920
Ridiculous!

26:17.319 --> 26:18.720
This way.

26:51.319 --> 26:54.400
That's her second bag,
started at 12:42.

26:54.440 --> 26:55.720
Got it.

26:55.759 --> 26:58.200
Pulse is OK, BP's a little high.

26:58.240 --> 27:00.480
For a minute there,
I was worried your boss

27:00.519 --> 27:01.880
was gonna make us turn around.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.400
Believe me, she thought about it.

27:03.440 --> 27:07.039
If I hadn't been there with you,
would you have left her?

27:08.839 --> 27:10.960
I don't know. Maybe.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
MONITOR ALARM BEEPS

27:13.039 --> 27:14.319
Pulse is dropping.

27:14.359 --> 27:16.680
BP?
Climbing. Mannitol?

27:23.400 --> 27:25.319
Can I have my camera back, please?

27:25.359 --> 27:27.480
Give it back, you'll break it!

27:27.519 --> 27:29.079
Shut up!

27:29.119 --> 27:31.799
Please! Just give it back!

27:31.839 --> 27:34.920
Hey!
It's mine!  Hey!

27:36.119 --> 27:39.720
What do you think you're doing?
Bobby, you OK? Give it back to him.

27:39.759 --> 27:40.880
Give what back?

27:40.920 --> 27:43.240
Don't play silly beggars
with me, mate.

27:43.279 --> 27:44.319
Just hand it over.

27:44.359 --> 27:47.119
What, this? This is MY camera.

27:47.160 --> 27:49.599
Right?
Yeah.

27:49.640 --> 27:52.200
You want me to take your picture?

27:52.240 --> 27:53.920
Smile.

27:53.960 --> 27:55.200
SHUTTER CLICKS

27:55.240 --> 27:56.480
THEY LAUGH

27:57.720 --> 27:59.599
SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE

28:01.400 --> 28:04.279
What did you call him?

28:04.319 --> 28:06.640
OK, sonny, last chance.

28:06.680 --> 28:08.880
Hand it over now
and we'll forget all about this.

28:08.920 --> 28:11.599
Or...?
Or we won't.

28:11.640 --> 28:13.480
And believe me you'll wish you had.

28:13.519 --> 28:15.680
I'm so glad you're here, Officer...

28:15.720 --> 28:17.519
Ugh!

28:19.680 --> 28:24.640
Yeah? What about you? 'Ey? Yeah?
Get out of it, then!

28:29.960 --> 28:31.559
Jesus Christ, that hurt!

28:31.599 --> 28:32.599
HE GROANS

28:36.000 --> 28:39.920
Bobby... Bobby, it's all right,
mate, they're gone.

28:42.400 --> 28:45.440
This decision
is totally irresponsible!

28:45.480 --> 28:48.559
To allow an infected patient
into the community...

28:48.599 --> 28:51.720
Was my choice. My staff are
isolated, no-one else is at risk.

28:51.759 --> 28:53.680
And I'll remind you
this is still my hospital

28:53.720 --> 28:55.200
and I decide how I run it.

28:55.240 --> 28:57.400
I certainly won't be lectured to
by the likes of you.

28:57.440 --> 28:58.759
The likes of me?

28:59.920 --> 29:01.720
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

29:01.759 --> 29:03.480
You see me as your inferior,
is that it?

29:03.519 --> 29:06.279
Oh! For God's sake, that's not
what I meant and you know it...

29:06.319 --> 29:08.240
So what exactly did you mean?

29:08.279 --> 29:10.440
You practically ignored me
this morning...

29:10.480 --> 29:13.279
Because, unlike a politician,
I still have a hospital to run.

29:13.319 --> 29:16.039
Badly, if this incident
is anything to go by.

29:16.079 --> 29:17.480
The girl is dying.

29:17.519 --> 29:19.000
Almost certainly!

29:20.480 --> 29:23.400
But as doctors,
whether Indian or English,

29:23.440 --> 29:28.000
we are supposed to retain clinical
judgement in all circumstances.

29:29.480 --> 29:30.480
And Dr Nair...

29:31.720 --> 29:34.359
..what is his opinion
on this gross recklessness?

29:40.000 --> 29:42.880
Dr Fonseca
has my full and total support.

29:42.920 --> 29:47.359
All the required quarantine measures
were followed.

29:47.400 --> 29:49.240
Your suggestion is unwarranted.

29:49.279 --> 29:51.799
Dr Fonseca is an Indian citizen,
just like you and I.

29:51.839 --> 29:56.319
So we are all, unfortunately,
together in this terrible situation.

29:56.359 --> 29:57.599
We need you.

29:59.440 --> 30:01.720
She's coning.
Right pupil's just blown.

30:01.759 --> 30:03.599
Have you tried mannitol?
Not enough.

30:03.640 --> 30:05.799
If we don't reduce the pressure
she'll be dead soon.

30:05.839 --> 30:07.480
Craniotomy is our only option.

30:07.519 --> 30:10.079
But we don't have a neurosurgeon.
I can do it.

30:10.119 --> 30:11.920
I had a training number
before I left the UK.

30:11.960 --> 30:13.400
I've done the procedure.

30:13.440 --> 30:15.599
If Ruby can gas for me,
I can operate.

30:15.640 --> 30:16.920
But I'll need a nurse to scrub in.

30:16.960 --> 30:18.839
Impossible.
I can't risk any more of my staff.

30:20.799 --> 30:22.319
No...

30:22.359 --> 30:24.880
There's diamorphine in the fridge.
Make her comfortable.

30:24.920 --> 30:26.240
She shouldn't suffer.

30:26.279 --> 30:27.799
I'm sorry,
we gave the girl a chance.

30:27.839 --> 30:29.960
I understand.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.799
Right decision.
You made the correct choice.

30:32.839 --> 30:34.039
DOOR OPENS

30:36.200 --> 30:37.359
No harm done.

30:37.400 --> 30:40.039
Well, maybe a little,
but he deserved it.

30:40.079 --> 30:41.839
Bullies are the same the world over.

30:41.880 --> 30:43.759
Bobby told me you head-butted him?

30:45.160 --> 30:46.559
You're bleeding...

30:46.599 --> 30:48.759
Just glad I'm not a woodpecker.

30:48.799 --> 30:50.000
Hell of a way to make a living.

30:53.640 --> 30:55.240
I knew this was all a mistake.

30:55.279 --> 30:57.160
If I could get on a plane tomorrow,
I would...

30:57.200 --> 31:00.720
Hey, hey.
Give the place a chance, yeah?

31:00.759 --> 31:03.279
I did, and I'm still here.

31:03.319 --> 31:05.640
20 years on, living the dream.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.839
With a headache.

31:07.880 --> 31:12.359
HE SCOFFS
Look around you. Small price to pay.

31:16.400 --> 31:18.400
MONITOR ALARM BEEPS RAPIDLY

31:27.839 --> 31:29.960
OK, I'm starting a craniotomy now.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.240
Systolic at 160.

31:39.440 --> 31:42.279
Get ready for rapid closure
in case of herniation.

31:42.319 --> 31:45.839
Have some lintins to hand.
Yes, Doctor.

31:45.880 --> 31:48.039
The dura's tenting.
How's her blood pressure?

31:48.079 --> 31:49.759
200 systolic.

31:49.799 --> 31:52.240
Scissors and forceps.

31:54.119 --> 31:56.119
Dropping. 180.

31:58.920 --> 32:00.279
Brain's beginning to herniate.

32:00.319 --> 32:03.920
I need a 100ml of 3% hypertonic
saline pushed through now.

32:06.559 --> 32:07.920
PHONE RINGS

32:11.640 --> 32:13.400
Yes?

32:20.759 --> 32:21.920
What?

32:25.000 --> 32:26.160
You!

32:27.759 --> 32:30.200
I just now got off the phone
with Mr Khan.

32:30.240 --> 32:33.240
I gave you a specific instruction
and you defied me!

32:33.279 --> 32:34.920
I thought his wife
had a right to know

32:34.960 --> 32:36.880
her husband
was putting his life at risk,

32:36.920 --> 32:38.880
so I called her.
Oh, you "thought"!

32:38.920 --> 32:41.759
Well, in that case,
please, forgive me.

32:41.799 --> 32:44.640
Clearly,
my opinion is worth nothing!

32:44.680 --> 32:48.920
Let me tell you, I am sick and tired
of being ignored in this place.

32:48.960 --> 32:51.279
My hospital! Sick and tired of it!

32:53.720 --> 32:58.839
You have deliberately
breached patient confidentiality.

32:58.880 --> 33:02.319
If Mr Khan
proceeds against you legally,

33:02.359 --> 33:04.839
you will lose your
licence to practice

33:04.880 --> 33:07.319
and this hospital
will be under threat.

33:07.359 --> 33:11.319
So, here is what
you are going to do.

33:11.359 --> 33:12.960
You are going to go back there,

33:13.000 --> 33:15.799
beg his forgiveness
and carry out his wishes.

33:15.839 --> 33:17.759
Am I clear?

33:17.799 --> 33:19.599
Yes, Doctor Nair.
Go!

33:24.680 --> 33:26.480
ALARM BEEPING RAPIDLY

33:32.000 --> 33:33.720
We need a drain and a pressure bolt.

33:33.759 --> 33:34.960
Doctor.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.319
BEEPING CONTINUES

33:48.519 --> 33:51.440
It's working. 21mm of mercury.

33:53.799 --> 33:57.079
That's OK. High, but OK.

33:57.119 --> 33:58.480
BEEPING SLOWS

33:59.519 --> 34:00.839
You hear that?

34:00.880 --> 34:02.519
No alarms.

34:17.159 --> 34:18.559
Just through there.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.920
To have a voice like mine,
is such a gift.

34:37.519 --> 34:42.679
Make people move,
laugh, dance and cry.

34:42.719 --> 34:46.719
It is my privilege...
and I cannot give it up.

34:48.480 --> 34:51.599
But you think I'm being selfish,
correct?

34:53.280 --> 34:55.800
I know your family cares about you.

34:55.840 --> 34:57.199
Ha!

34:57.239 --> 35:00.800
I think the big boss
sent you here to apologise.

35:02.519 --> 35:04.840
Afraid old Amir would get
the lawyers onto him.

35:07.800 --> 35:11.199
What I did was wrong.
It's your choice.

35:13.360 --> 35:17.079
But, for what it's worth,
I believe you're making a mistake.

35:17.119 --> 35:19.639
Maybe we just value
different things.

35:21.199 --> 35:24.039
Maybe we agree to differ.

35:24.079 --> 35:25.599
That's the phrase, hmm?

35:27.280 --> 35:30.599
My father is a very clever man.

35:30.639 --> 35:33.800
A great surgeon, too.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.800
Do you know
the problem with clever men?

35:37.400 --> 35:39.119
They always know best.

35:40.280 --> 35:42.599
Usually, they're right.

35:42.639 --> 35:45.719
But sometimes even a clever person
can make a mistake.

35:48.519 --> 35:51.719
Your daughter wants
to share her life with you.

35:51.760 --> 35:55.360
Her marriage, her babies,
her joy and her pain.

35:57.519 --> 35:59.679
That is more important
than any song.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.880
Don't take that away from her.

36:10.840 --> 36:12.199
Thank you for trying.

36:18.559 --> 36:20.039
Doctor?

36:20.079 --> 36:24.079
If I do this for you, then you
have to do something for me.

36:24.119 --> 36:25.800
OK?

36:34.280 --> 36:36.159
Mr Greg McConnell?

36:36.199 --> 36:38.000
Guilty.

36:38.039 --> 36:39.519
Everything OK?

36:39.559 --> 36:42.440
Don't tell me some toerag's
turned over my bar again.

36:42.480 --> 36:45.000
You are being arrested for assault.

36:45.039 --> 36:46.320
I'm being what?

36:46.360 --> 36:49.880
Oh, oh, all right, lads.
'Ey! Good grip.

36:49.920 --> 36:52.920
I can see that.
I'm coming quietly, aren't I?

36:58.679 --> 37:00.519
No, this way.

37:01.599 --> 37:04.280
Landscape, not portrait.
We are not savages.

37:06.920 --> 37:09.079
To all my precious
family and friends,

37:09.119 --> 37:13.320
both alive and yet to come,
here is my song,

37:13.360 --> 37:16.559
delivered with love and respect.

37:16.599 --> 37:17.760
They say that in life

37:17.800 --> 37:21.039
you should sing each song
as if it is your last.

37:21.079 --> 37:26.519
So if this is my last song,
let's make it a wonderful one.

37:27.880 --> 37:33.320
JAUNTY TUNE PLAYS

37:36.679 --> 37:39.960
HE SINGS IN HINDI

38:18.039 --> 38:21.039
Hello, darling.

38:21.079 --> 38:22.679
Funny story...

38:31.760 --> 38:33.400
HE GROANS

38:34.440 --> 38:37.159
Ah!
What happened to healing hands?

38:37.199 --> 38:40.360
They went the same way as your
common sense. Fighting, seriously?

38:40.400 --> 38:42.519
India needs superheroes.

38:42.559 --> 38:43.639
I'm like...
HE WINCES

38:43.679 --> 38:46.159
..Superman,
if he wore flowery shorts

38:46.199 --> 38:47.920
and owned a world-famous beach bar.

38:47.960 --> 38:51.920
World-famous, is it?
Let it go. It's my fantasy.

38:51.960 --> 38:53.719
Oh.

38:55.239 --> 38:56.639
I heard about the drama.

38:56.679 --> 38:58.599
How's the little girl?

38:58.639 --> 39:02.039
She's stable for now.
The village has been isolated.

39:02.079 --> 39:03.199
There are no further cases,

39:03.239 --> 39:05.400
so, hopefully,
that should contain the outbreak.

39:05.440 --> 39:07.760
What about the others?
They're gonna be in quarantine

39:07.800 --> 39:10.159
for two weeks with the girl.

39:10.199 --> 39:13.559
You made the right decision, 100%.

39:13.599 --> 39:15.719
Did I?

39:15.760 --> 39:18.960
Life was so much easier when I
believed in every decision I made.

39:20.599 --> 39:22.360
Come here. Come on.

39:23.480 --> 39:25.320
Mmm.

39:25.360 --> 39:28.760
When did you learn to do exactly
the right thing at the right time?

39:28.800 --> 39:30.480
Training.

39:30.519 --> 39:32.440
Just good training.

39:32.480 --> 39:33.840
You coming home?

39:33.880 --> 39:36.280
Got a couple
of nice fat tuna steaks.

39:36.320 --> 39:39.119
Yeah.
There's something I gotta do first.

39:41.079 --> 39:44.440
I've received Dr Varma's
official resignation letter.

39:44.480 --> 39:46.199
I'm sorry.

39:47.840 --> 39:49.519
It's fine.

39:50.679 --> 39:52.239
Doesn't matter.

39:53.800 --> 39:56.159
Broken hearts matter a great deal,
Ruby.

39:57.519 --> 39:59.079
I'm not 16 any more.

39:59.119 --> 40:01.960
Well, me neither,
but it still hurts.

40:02.000 --> 40:06.599
You think she's trying to buy her
way out or is it just a cosy chat?

40:06.639 --> 40:08.760
Lydia doesn't chat.

40:11.159 --> 40:13.119
And you?

40:13.159 --> 40:14.239
Erm...

40:15.360 --> 40:20.360
I have my moments.
I chat, but never at work.

40:20.400 --> 40:22.000
That would be unprofessional.

40:22.039 --> 40:25.360
Obviously, but...

40:25.400 --> 40:28.159
I think we can make
an exception now, right?

40:28.199 --> 40:30.679
Ha, agreed.

40:34.880 --> 40:37.760
Do you remember I once told you
that breaking up with a man

40:37.800 --> 40:39.519
is like removing a sticking plaster.

40:39.559 --> 40:42.880
Just rip it off and it
only hurts for two seconds.

40:42.920 --> 40:44.039
Yeah, I remember.

40:44.079 --> 40:45.519
I lied.

40:48.079 --> 40:50.320
Don't make my mistake.

40:50.360 --> 40:53.920
Don't waste the best years of your
life pretending you're invincible.

40:57.280 --> 40:58.400
Thanks for letting me know.

40:58.440 --> 41:00.440
OK.

41:00.480 --> 41:01.679
Bye.

41:11.480 --> 41:15.960
So...
what do you wanna talk about?

41:16.000 --> 41:18.599
I mean,
I usually start with the weather,

41:18.639 --> 41:22.039
but it's basically just hot
all the time here, right?

41:22.079 --> 41:25.960
Yes, it's pretty hot...

41:26.000 --> 41:28.320
especially for someone new.

41:28.360 --> 41:30.519
Being new to India...

41:34.920 --> 41:40.840
I spy with my little eye,
something beginning with... V.

41:40.880 --> 41:42.280
Ventilator.

41:43.440 --> 41:45.000
Damn, OK.

41:46.159 --> 41:47.559
Your turn.

41:49.079 --> 41:53.760
I spy with my little eye,
something beginning with...

41:53.800 --> 41:55.239
K.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.000
K?
Yes.

41:58.840 --> 42:01.000
Karishma.
SHE SCOFFS

42:01.039 --> 42:02.880
What was that?

42:02.920 --> 42:04.679
Because you got it wrong.

42:08.480 --> 42:10.880
BUBBLING

42:10.920 --> 42:12.199
Oh, bollocks.

42:15.840 --> 42:17.440
'Hiya.'

42:19.239 --> 42:22.360
That smells bloody gorgeous.
You're turning into a domestic god.

42:22.400 --> 42:25.440
And one who can spot acute
alcohol deficiency at ten paces.

42:25.480 --> 42:28.239
And now I'm in love.
Mmm.

42:30.559 --> 42:33.599
Just gonna jump in the shower.
Right behind you.

42:40.760 --> 42:42.760
