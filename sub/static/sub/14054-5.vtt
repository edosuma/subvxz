00:03.800 --> 00:07.236
Well, now that you've moved in, I see
you're making yourself right at home.

00:07.400 --> 00:08.753
You're not, like, into him, are you? 

00:08.920 --> 00:10.990
You told Summer you weren't coming.
Now you're here with him?

00:11.160 --> 00:12.878
- Ryan and I aren't here together.
- We're done.

00:13.040 --> 00:15.793
I can't say no to my family.
I'll pay everything back.

00:15.960 --> 00:19.350
- Put your feelings for him aside.
- He's one of my oldest friends.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.796
Are you telling me you lost everything?
That is my money! My kids' tuition!

00:22.960 --> 00:25.599
- I'm sorry.
- Son of a bitch! You're a thief!

00:25.760 --> 00:28.558
- I'm sorry.
- I just need to be alone right now.

01:00.840 --> 01:02.831
So, what are we doing
in front of this tank?

01:03.000 --> 01:05.309
Ryan, we're like two samurai, really.

01:05.480 --> 01:09.439
And we need to have respect
for each other before meeting in battle.

01:09.600 --> 01:13.070
And eating lobster is a battle,
as you will soon learn.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.798
Is that a new shirt?

01:14.960 --> 01:18.236
Yeah. Your mom bought me some new
clothes, which she didn't have to do.

01:18.400 --> 01:21.039
Right. You can get a lot of mileage
out of a tank top.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.953
Hey, do you think I could pull off
the wife-beater?

01:24.120 --> 01:26.111
You know, switch up my look?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.195
Got you. You got your style, I got mine.

01:29.360 --> 01:31.271
- Yeah.
- You're dead.

01:34.040 --> 01:38.192
That was amazing.
A lot of work, but amazing.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.999
What's going on with you and Marissa?
Did you talk to her?

01:41.160 --> 01:42.991
I don't think she wants to talk.

01:43.160 --> 01:46.630
- Everything with her and her dad...
- Do you know what your problem is?

01:46.800 --> 01:49.678
And I speak from experience,
with great authority here.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.638
Is that you really need
to be aggressive, okay?

01:52.800 --> 01:56.713
Her and Luke broke up. You need to go
after her, tell her how you feel. It's easy.

01:56.880 --> 01:59.872
What do we do? Where do we go?
I have no car, no money.

02:01.360 --> 02:05.353
I got it. I picked up extra sailing lessons
this week. Feeling a little bit flush.

02:05.520 --> 02:07.238
Not you too. I can't keep doing this.

02:07.400 --> 02:10.597
Your parents pay for everything.
I can't keep taking their money.

02:10.759 --> 02:13.035
- They're parents. They work for us.
- They're your parents.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.794
They're your guardians.
It's the same principle.

02:15.960 --> 02:18.838
- What are you gonna do for cash, then?
- You're out of here!

02:19.000 --> 02:21.275
You can't fire me. I quit!

02:28.600 --> 02:31.319
Fine. But you're hooking me up
with free lobster.

03:01.400 --> 03:04.233
This actually works out good for me,
you starting the new job.

03:04.400 --> 03:08.154
I'll have time to do that stuff I haven't
been able to do since you moved here...

03:08.320 --> 03:10.151
...like I'm gonna get to start my novel.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.594
I'll be back by 6.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.432
Yeah. I know. It's 9 now.

03:13.600 --> 03:16.478
Which means I'm gonna have
nine hours of "me" time.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.392
Know what I'm saying? For me, Ryan.

03:18.560 --> 03:21.438
I'm gonna do stuff like learn Chinese,
study my Talmud.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.079
You know, sink my teeth into it.

03:23.240 --> 03:24.912
You gonna be okay?

03:25.080 --> 03:26.399
Yes. Before you moved here...

03:26.560 --> 03:29.632
...all I did was hang out by myself,
so it's really a return to form.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.233
Should we not go?

03:31.400 --> 03:34.358
Maybe we could tell Julie
we're not going and go anyway.

03:34.520 --> 03:37.910
You guys, that's too mean.
We can't do that. Can we, Kirsten?

03:38.080 --> 03:41.470
Absolutely not. We've had this retreat
on the books now for months.

03:41.640 --> 03:43.232
And Julie's looking forward to it.

03:43.400 --> 03:46.437
Yeah, and some of us
were looking forward to retiring early...

03:46.600 --> 03:48.556
...before her husband stole our money.

03:48.720 --> 03:50.711
Dad. What are you doing, man?

03:50.880 --> 03:53.075
I'm waiting for them to disperse.

03:53.240 --> 03:56.357
I left my briefcase in there.
I need to get to work.

03:56.520 --> 03:59.876
- Well, go get it.
- And talk to those women? I can't.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.996
He didn't steal. It wasn't like...

04:02.520 --> 04:04.511
She's our friend.

04:04.680 --> 04:08.195
I can't believe you're defending them.
Jimmy Cooper's a thief and a felon.

04:08.640 --> 04:09.834
Those women are obsessed.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.514
You kidding?
A scandal this big in a town this small...

04:12.680 --> 04:14.591
...they'll be dining out
on this for months.

04:14.760 --> 04:17.991
What are their kids gonna do?
I mean, with their father in prison?

04:18.160 --> 04:20.515
- You think he's going to jail?
- I heard 10 to 20.

04:20.680 --> 04:23.399
- Is it true he's going to jail?
- He stole a lot of money...

04:23.560 --> 04:24.754
...from powerful people.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.277
What's Marissa gonna do
without her dad?

04:27.440 --> 04:29.590
No one knows if she'll even wanna go.

04:29.760 --> 04:33.594
I don't want to go, I have to go.
The trip's already been paid for.

04:33.760 --> 04:38.356
Besides, if I don't show up, they'll spend
the entire weekend gossiping about me.

04:38.520 --> 04:39.999
You're being a little paranoid.

04:40.160 --> 04:43.470
No, I'm not. I'm sure they think
I've masterminded this whole debacle.

04:43.640 --> 04:45.631
Honey, they're your friends.

04:45.800 --> 04:48.792
Please. They're the gatekeepers
of this entire community...

04:48.960 --> 04:52.032
...a community your daughters and I
would like to remain a part of.

04:52.200 --> 04:56.034
This is my chance to go before the firing
squad and plead for a stay of execution.

04:56.200 --> 04:59.510
I was hoping to be able to talk
this weekend.

04:59.680 --> 05:02.240
This is your mess, Jimmy.
You clean it up.

05:02.400 --> 05:06.473
And when I get back, we'll figure out
what the hell we're gonna tell our girls.

05:10.640 --> 05:12.870
I'm totally crispy.

05:13.040 --> 05:17.636
Let's go do something.
Shopping, get exfoliated, anything.

05:17.800 --> 05:21.156
And pay for it how? I mean, my dad's
credit cards got shut off yesterday.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.515
What about Luke?
I mean, he can pay for you.

05:24.040 --> 05:26.713
- He is your boyfriend, right?
- I don't know.

05:28.320 --> 05:30.038
We left things kind of up in the air.

05:30.200 --> 05:35.115
- You haven't talked since cotillion?
- I haven't talked to anyone, except you.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.714
Okay, this is so not the way
to handle this.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.792
You're gonna become depressed.
Then you'll need medication...

05:41.960 --> 05:44.838
...and then you're gonna stop
feeling like anything.

05:45.280 --> 05:47.350
According to my stepmom.

05:49.160 --> 05:52.948
Let me buy you lunch. My dad gave me
his credit card in case of emergencies.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.396
- And, well, this is an emergency.
- Okay.

05:56.560 --> 05:58.949
All right, man, I'm gonna give you
the rundown.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.119
This...

06:02.440 --> 06:03.714
...is garbage.

06:03.880 --> 06:05.996
It belongs in the garbage.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.799
This belongs over here.

06:09.560 --> 06:11.949
And now for the advanced class.

06:12.120 --> 06:16.113
Hello, Mrs. Palmer. How are you today?
Would you like another glass of merlot?

06:16.280 --> 06:17.918
Coming right up.

06:19.360 --> 06:20.793
Drunk.

06:20.960 --> 06:23.155
- Been working here long?
- Oh, man, too long.

06:23.320 --> 06:27.108
Everybody who comes in is a freak show.
They like $30 entrees on plastic plates...

06:27.280 --> 06:31.671
...$60 bottles of wine in plastic cups,
and service with a big smile.

06:31.840 --> 06:34.638
Welcome to Newport,
where things only appear to be casual.

06:35.800 --> 06:38.758
Of course,
living here does have its upside.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.911
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:42.480 --> 06:44.038
First day on the job.

06:44.720 --> 06:47.917
Well, the food here is really good.

06:48.320 --> 06:49.912
Yeah.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.195
- How's your dad?
- He's okay.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.838
- How are you?
- Coop! Starving.

06:58.120 --> 07:00.190
- I should get back to work.
- Right.

07:00.360 --> 07:02.954
You wanna hang out sometime?
Go out?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.753
- Like on a date?
- Not a date, just...

07:08.200 --> 07:09.997
- I can't right now.
- No, of course.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.596
- Right.
- But thanks.

07:14.760 --> 07:16.239
See you.

07:21.720 --> 07:23.711
Hey, Jimmy.

07:27.560 --> 07:30.632
- How's it going?
- Never better.

07:30.800 --> 07:34.315
Listen, I was thinking, how would you
like some free legal advice?

07:34.880 --> 07:38.350
You wanna be my lawyer? How long
do you wanna send me away for?

07:38.520 --> 07:41.159
- I got way too big an ego for that.
- Well, that's true.

07:41.320 --> 07:44.835
I wouldn't be representing you. I have
a friend who's a securities attorney.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.877
But I could help you
put together a case.

07:47.040 --> 07:49.395
Why? You don't even like me.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.716
Well, I'm a public defender.

07:51.880 --> 07:54.440
I represent a lot of people I don't like.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.429
I wish somebody had told me
he worked here now.

08:02.600 --> 08:03.794
- Why?
- No reason.

08:04.760 --> 08:07.320
Oh, what do you know? Luke.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.477
- What a coincidence.
- You invited him?

08:10.640 --> 08:13.313
- Gotta pee. See you.
- Wait, Summer.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.711
Hey, man.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.791
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

08:26.040 --> 08:29.077
I hate that kid, man.
I seriously hate that kid.

08:29.240 --> 08:30.832
He walks in like he owns the place.

08:31.640 --> 08:35.155
Let me tell you, that Abercrombie & Fitch
water-polo-playing bitch...

08:35.320 --> 08:37.356
...wouldn't last two minutes in Corona.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.317
- You're from Corona?
- Yeah, man.

08:39.480 --> 08:41.914
- Chino.
- Chino?

08:42.080 --> 08:44.310
It's a long way from home.
That place is no joke.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.118
I'm sorry I haven't called you back.

08:46.280 --> 08:49.795
No worries.
We don't have to talk about it.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.632
- Maybe we should talk about it.
- Why?

08:51.800 --> 08:55.588
Talking about stuff is just gonna get us
all bummed out. Let's just do something.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.593
- Newport kids must make you sick too.
- Sounds like you're a fan.

08:58.760 --> 09:01.957
You know, I like the surf,
I like the tips, love the girls.

09:02.720 --> 09:05.518
It's not all like this.
There's some real people around here.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.033
- Oh, yeah?
- I tell you what.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.998
After work, I'll show you
what I'm talking about. Cool?

09:10.160 --> 09:11.593
Cool.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.556
Holly's beach house. Party.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.438
- I don't really want to.
- Why not?

09:18.600 --> 09:23.116
It's weird. I mean, her dad beat up
my dad at my debutante ball.

09:23.280 --> 09:26.955
You can't blame Holly for that.
I mean, your dad stole all their mon...

09:28.400 --> 09:29.958
Nice.

09:49.720 --> 09:52.598
Normally we don't tip out to trainees,
but you did good, man.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.990
- Thanks.
- All right, now you can buy me a beer.

09:55.160 --> 09:57.958
- I'm gonna grab my sweatshirt.
- All right.

10:06.360 --> 10:07.952
- Hey.
- What's up?

10:08.120 --> 10:11.874
Craziest thing. I was in the neighborhood,
checked my watch, it's 6:00...

10:12.040 --> 10:14.952
...I figured maybe we'd celebrate
your first day on the job.

10:15.120 --> 10:16.519
- Yeah.
- Yo, kid. You ready?

10:16.680 --> 10:20.559
Yeah. I made other plans. This is Donnie.
He grew up in a town next to me.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.358
- Donnie, Seth.
- What's up, man?

10:22.520 --> 10:26.069
Hey, what's up? You guys must
have a lot of catching up to do.

10:26.240 --> 10:31.439
Got some girls we gotta catch up with.
The blond's a dancer.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.429
Yes. The ladies. I feel you.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.716
Well, do you wanna...?
Donnie, is it cool...?

10:37.880 --> 10:41.190
No, no, no. Please, no.
You guys go. I have to...

10:41.360 --> 10:44.432
I was gonna do stuff.
Donnie, it was really good to meet you.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.670
- All right, man. Let's go.
- See you.

10:46.840 --> 10:50.116
So then I'll see you at home tomorrow.

10:50.280 --> 10:52.555
Or tonight. I don't know. Just go.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.359
- You sure you don't want to...?
- No, no. Just...

10:55.520 --> 10:57.636
- All right.
- Okay.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.119
Have fun.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.958
What are you reading?

11:33.120 --> 11:35.236
The new <i>Legion</i> came out Wednesday.

11:35.800 --> 11:37.916
- It's part two of five.
- I liked part one.

11:38.080 --> 11:40.310
Yeah, I'll let you borrow it
when I'm done.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.272
Thanks.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.349
How was last night?

11:45.520 --> 11:46.919
- Fun.
- Cool.

11:48.040 --> 11:51.953
That's cool that, you know, you met
someone that's where you're from.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.759
You know, it's just cool.

12:05.960 --> 12:08.679
I mean, I know he's not
the most sensitive guy in the world.

12:08.840 --> 12:11.479
No one wants to see you
with Luke more than me.

12:11.640 --> 12:13.915
But what you're going through
right now is gnarly.

12:14.080 --> 12:16.640
Luke's a boy. Maybe he can't handle it.

12:17.160 --> 12:18.752
Is it bad to burn on top of a peel?

12:20.760 --> 12:23.069
Yeah. Put 30 on.

12:23.240 --> 12:25.037
Coop, your life will stabilize.

12:25.200 --> 12:28.317
Your parents will work it out.
Your mom will go away this weekend...

12:28.480 --> 12:30.596
...they'll miss each other
and have makeup sex.

12:30.760 --> 12:33.672
- Summer. God.
- It's true.

12:35.400 --> 12:36.879
Marissa.

12:37.320 --> 12:38.753
Hi.

12:41.160 --> 12:44.550
- I'm just heading to the office.
- Yeah, me too.

12:45.960 --> 12:48.349
- You know what...?
- I was thinking...

12:49.120 --> 12:51.429
When I asked you to hang out,
I was asking you out.

12:51.680 --> 12:53.398
- I know.
- I wanted to clear that up...

12:53.560 --> 12:55.471
...because I'm gonna ask you out again.

12:55.640 --> 12:57.631
Do you wanna do something tonight?

12:57.800 --> 12:59.756
I have to babysit for Kaitlin.

12:59.920 --> 13:03.196
But I will be cooking.
Macaroni and cheese. It's my specialty.

13:03.360 --> 13:05.396
So that's a yes.

13:05.560 --> 13:06.993
All right.

13:08.960 --> 13:12.509
Won't these costs
be covered by Chapter 11?

13:12.680 --> 13:15.240
Well, filing for bankruptcy
won't make this go away.

13:15.400 --> 13:18.233
The U.S. Attorney's Office
is involved in this now.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.868
They'll push for fraud,
unauthorized transactions.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.838
Okay, so they fine me,
I go back to work, I make it all back.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.879
Four million dollars? Unless you plan on
going to the track and getting lucky...

13:28.040 --> 13:30.349
Look, if you don't wanna do this...

13:30.520 --> 13:32.954
You're gonna lose your Series 7 license.

13:33.120 --> 13:35.918
It's important that you understand
the predicament you're in.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.672
Look...

13:37.840 --> 13:41.276
...I get it from my wife every day,
my daughters won't talk to me...

13:41.440 --> 13:45.991
...I got beat up in front of everyone
at the most elegant event of the year.

13:46.160 --> 13:48.594
I get it. Okay, man?
I definitely understand.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.155
Well, look. You know, we're both tired.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.789
Maybe we should take a break,
go out.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.632
What do you wanna do?

13:57.800 --> 14:00.917
Well, our wives are away
for the weekend. We could...

14:02.040 --> 14:04.508
Well, what did we do
before we got married?

14:04.680 --> 14:06.511
Put that thing away, Kirsten.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.079
I'm sorry.

14:08.240 --> 14:12.279
We put a bid in on a new development,
and the counteroffer's outrageous.

14:12.440 --> 14:16.115
We're here to relax.
Just because you have a job...

14:16.280 --> 14:18.635
She's lucky she has a career.

14:19.240 --> 14:21.470
I mean, it's not luck.
You're a very hard worker.

14:22.920 --> 14:26.356
God knows I could use
my own income right about now.

14:26.840 --> 14:30.355
Let's say it. I better enjoy the weekend
because I won't be back for a while.

14:30.520 --> 14:32.590
Don't say that. It's not true.

14:32.760 --> 14:36.196
Jules, tell me. Did you have
any idea about any of it?

14:36.360 --> 14:38.237
How would I have known?

14:38.400 --> 14:42.359
We have a deal. My domain's the kitchen
and the bedroom. His is the office.

14:42.520 --> 14:45.318
- I held up my end of the bargain.
- You poor thing.

14:45.480 --> 14:48.950
Believe me, if I'd known, I'd have
taken my girls out of the country.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.031
It's them I'm concerned about.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.794
Having to live with the shame
of what your father's done?

14:53.960 --> 14:56.679
- Maybe we shouldn't talk about this.
- Oh, no, I don't mind.

14:56.840 --> 14:59.957
To be honest, I blame myself.

15:00.120 --> 15:03.396
I feel like I should have known,
like I should have sensed it somehow.

15:03.560 --> 15:07.109
- How could you? You had no idea.
- Don't beat yourself up. You're a victim.

15:07.280 --> 15:08.952
You're right, I know.
It's just...

15:09.120 --> 15:10.519
What else can I do?

15:10.680 --> 15:14.992
- I have the name of a great attorney.
- A good attorney could really help Jimmy.

15:15.160 --> 15:18.277
It's for Julie, to divorce his sorry ass.

15:18.440 --> 15:22.513
Girls, this isn't helping Julie relax.
Isn't that why we're here?

15:22.680 --> 15:25.990
Kirsten's right.
I mean, you wouldn't get a divorce.

15:27.720 --> 15:29.472
Would you?

15:35.080 --> 15:36.957
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:37.800 --> 15:42.112
How do you feel about
a little thing that I like to call...

15:42.600 --> 15:44.113
...the IMAX Experience?

15:44.960 --> 15:47.872
- This town sucks. The best I could do.
- I can't.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.792
I'm hanging out with Marissa tonight.

15:49.960 --> 15:52.235
We'll get a third ticket.
I doubt it'll sell out.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.152
Well, she's got her sister.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.276
Fine. Four tickets then. I like Kaitlin.

15:56.440 --> 15:58.670
She's nice, and she's smart,
for a fifth-grader.

15:58.840 --> 16:01.149
Actually, I...

16:01.320 --> 16:04.710
...was gonna go over there.
Help her babysit.

16:06.480 --> 16:07.754
Nice. The babysit.

16:07.920 --> 16:11.071
I see. Stepping it up, taking it
to the next level. I can respect that.

16:11.240 --> 16:12.992
Yeah. Hey, Donnie, I'm gonna head out.

16:13.160 --> 16:17.073
I'm gonna head out too. I can't believe
we survived this shift. I'm so hung-over.

16:17.560 --> 16:18.834
What are you gonna do now?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.991
- I got plans.
- All right, man.

16:23.880 --> 16:28.237
I have an extra ticket to the IMAX.
Shark movie, hammerheads, very violent.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.470
- What are you, like, 8?
- Got a better idea?

16:30.640 --> 16:34.599
I got a house party in Long Beach.
Six kegs, crazy honeys.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.035
- Okay, yes. That is better.
- Wanna come?

16:39.120 --> 16:40.269
Is that...? Is that cool?

16:40.760 --> 16:42.955
- Let me just change up.
- All right.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.997
- I do enjoy the crazy honeys.
- You're not going.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.116
Okay, Mom, except that I am.

16:51.280 --> 16:53.714
It's a shady neighborhood.
It's pretty hardcore.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.711
Dude, it's Long Beach, not Chechnya.

16:55.880 --> 16:58.075
Guys like Donnie,
you don't exactly know them...

16:58.240 --> 17:00.629
...and they don't exactly know
kids like you.

17:00.800 --> 17:03.314
- So I shouldn't talk about Grey Poupon?
- How you gonna get there?

17:03.480 --> 17:06.472
I got my mom's Range Rover.
Well, I'll park it up the street.

17:06.640 --> 17:09.473
Look, man, Donnie's a good guy, right?
He's cool, right?

17:09.640 --> 17:13.189
So maybe this way we can all
be friends. We can all hang out.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.551
- You boys game or what?
- Yeah, man.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.071
We'll go for one hour.

17:22.880 --> 17:25.952
Do you know how long it's been
since I've had a steak?

17:26.119 --> 17:27.519
I live with three vegetarians.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.399
You know how long it's been
since we had beer in the house?

17:30.560 --> 17:32.278
I'm so sick of chardonnay and merlot.

17:32.440 --> 17:33.668
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

17:36.400 --> 17:39.198
You wanna grab that?
These are almost done.

17:43.400 --> 17:46.358
- Hello?
- Jimmy? Did I dial your number?

17:46.520 --> 17:48.112
No, no. I'm at your place.

17:48.480 --> 17:49.879
Oh, working on the case?

17:50.040 --> 17:52.508
Well, we're taking a break, actually.

17:53.080 --> 17:54.115
With Sandy?

17:54.280 --> 17:56.999
Yeah. We're doing guy stuff.

17:58.760 --> 18:02.275
All right. Well, when you finish
doing guy stuff...

18:02.440 --> 18:06.433
...would you have Sandy give me a call?
I called to see if everything was okay.

18:06.600 --> 18:09.433
- Is it?
- Well...

18:09.600 --> 18:11.238
I guess. I don't know.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.790
You know,
I've been really worried about you.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.269
<i>Thanks. I appreciate it.</i>

18:17.440 --> 18:21.319
Well, I'll talk to you when I get back.
Take care, Jimmy.

18:24.120 --> 18:26.793
Your concern for my husband
is really touching.

18:28.400 --> 18:31.358
Can you believe that? God.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.111
She really is a dancer.

19:09.040 --> 19:12.077
Chino. Come here, man.
I want you to meet some of my boys.

19:12.240 --> 19:15.038
- We have 45 minutes.
- We should invite her to the pool house.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.872
- Don't say "pool house."
- Right.

19:17.040 --> 19:20.396
Oh, dude, I thought you said
you played before.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.120
Well, some people
have a natural talent.

19:24.720 --> 19:25.869
Not me.

19:26.040 --> 19:29.589
I haven't played video games in, like...
I can't remember last time I played.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.751
Are we old? Because...

19:32.360 --> 19:36.148
...if I didn't know better,
I'd swear I was still 16.

19:36.320 --> 19:39.392
Hell, I'm still 22.
It was the best year of my life.

19:39.840 --> 19:43.958
- Yeah? Why 22?
- That's when I met Kirsten.

19:45.880 --> 19:49.316
- Why 16?
- Oh, that's when...

19:50.600 --> 19:52.511
...I met Kirsten.

20:02.680 --> 20:04.875
- Hello?
- <i>Marissa?</i>

20:05.040 --> 20:07.554
Hey. Where are you?

20:07.720 --> 20:11.395
What'd I tell you, man?
How much better is this than Newport?

20:12.480 --> 20:15.438
I got dragged to a party,
but I'm leaving. I'm on my way.

20:15.600 --> 20:19.229
I just gotta get
Seth away from this...

20:19.400 --> 20:21.789
- This dancer.
- Dancer?

20:22.240 --> 20:26.119
It's a long story, but I'll be there soon.

20:26.280 --> 20:29.158
- Save me some mac and cheese?
- Sure. See you.

20:32.200 --> 20:35.192
- No, no way...
- Seth.

20:38.120 --> 20:39.678
One second.

20:39.840 --> 20:43.071
Hang on a second. Listen,
I am really connecting with this girl.

20:43.240 --> 20:47.074
She just moved here with her sister from
Uzbekistan, they're saving for a condo.

20:47.240 --> 20:48.673
Nice. That hits here.

20:48.840 --> 20:52.833
Now, she does have a serious boyfriend,
but she's looking into...

20:55.480 --> 20:57.357
Good luck with the condo.

21:00.520 --> 21:03.830
Some dude just demo'd
a Range Rover.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.309
That car's messed up.

21:17.800 --> 21:20.314
This happened in the parking lot
of the IMAX theater?

21:21.680 --> 21:23.318
Shark movies bring out
a rough crowd.

21:26.160 --> 21:29.869
I'll call the insurance company, but
you're explaining this to your mother.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.917
It could get ugly.

21:37.240 --> 21:38.559
Yeah.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.229
So did you call Marissa?

21:42.400 --> 21:45.198
I tried her again this morning.
She doesn't wanna talk.

21:45.360 --> 21:49.114
- I'm sorry I salted your game, man.
- I gotta get to work.

21:57.280 --> 22:00.158
I'll give you Richard's number
when we get back. He's the best.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.231
He did Carol's divorce.
She got everything.

22:02.400 --> 22:04.118
Thanks. That'd be great.

22:04.280 --> 22:07.477
- You're really considering a divorce?
- Why, are you gonna tell Jimmy?

22:07.840 --> 22:09.637
Julie needs to protect herself.

22:09.800 --> 22:13.031
I can't believe you're encouraging this.
When your husband had an affair...

22:13.200 --> 22:15.350
...no one gave you
a divorce attorney's number.

22:15.520 --> 22:17.829
Kirsten, that was very uncalled-for.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.595
What's uncalled-for is your
$500-a-day coke habit in college.

22:21.760 --> 22:25.196
- It was just sophomore year.
- What Jimmy did was wrong.

22:25.360 --> 22:28.158
Spare me. You have a Guatemalan family
cleaning your house...

22:28.320 --> 22:30.470
...for less than minimum wage.

22:31.680 --> 22:36.310
I have spent this entire weekend
listening to you women judge Jimmy.

22:36.480 --> 22:40.109
Yes, he made a big mistake. But life is
complicated, and none of us is perfect.

22:40.280 --> 22:43.317
- Not even you, Julie.
- And what is that supposed to mean?

22:43.480 --> 22:46.313
He didn't buy ponies and jewelry
for himself.

22:46.480 --> 22:49.199
How interesting that you
should take his side.

22:49.360 --> 22:50.952
Shower time. Limo leaves at 6.

22:51.120 --> 22:54.510
He did this to give you everything.
And now you're just gonna leave him?

22:54.680 --> 22:56.079
He lied to me, Kirsten.

22:56.240 --> 22:58.549
You lied to yourself! I know Jimmy.

22:58.720 --> 23:02.952
I know. I've heard. He still has
your prom photo up on our wall.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.672
- It's all in the past.
- Really?

23:05.840 --> 23:09.833
You think it's a coincidence that we
ended up living next door to you?

23:10.000 --> 23:13.879
I'm the one who married him.
This is my problem, not yours.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.197
Who knew that
when he knocked me up...

23:19.360 --> 23:22.955
...it'd be the best thing
that ever happened to you?

23:38.840 --> 23:40.398
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:40.560 --> 23:43.632
Your dad let me in.
Seems like he's doing better.

23:43.960 --> 23:45.473
Yeah, I guess.

23:47.120 --> 23:48.917
Do you need to get that?

23:49.080 --> 23:52.152
It's probably just Summer calling
about another party at Holly's.

23:52.320 --> 23:54.550
Yes, another one of those.

23:55.680 --> 23:58.240
- So how'd it go with the dancer?
- Actually...

23:58.400 --> 24:02.154
...that's what I wanted to talk about.
Last night was totally my fault.

24:02.320 --> 24:06.313
Okay? Ryan was extremely bummed he
didn't get to make his Blockbuster night.

24:06.480 --> 24:09.711
I know you're going through a lot,
and you didn't need to get stood up.

24:09.880 --> 24:13.714
- So I apologize.
- Wow, that's very...

24:13.880 --> 24:16.713
...thoughtful.
- Well, he's pretty mad at me right now.

24:16.880 --> 24:19.269
Why don't you help me out?
How about another date?

24:21.400 --> 24:23.755
He's a good cook.

24:30.840 --> 24:34.276
I tell you, one good swing...

24:34.440 --> 24:36.317
...and I love this game.

24:36.480 --> 24:37.879
Nice drive.

24:39.760 --> 24:43.355
So I talked to my friend,
the securities attorney, this morning.

24:43.520 --> 24:44.999
Working on the weekend?

24:45.160 --> 24:47.230
Working for you, to keep you out of jail.

24:47.400 --> 24:50.472
- He's pretty sure he can make it happen.
- Excellent.

24:50.640 --> 24:52.870
It's contingent upon you
making full restitution.

24:53.480 --> 24:57.473
You'll lose your license and never be
allowed near an investment account.

24:57.640 --> 25:01.349
- But little or no jail time.
- So I gotta pay back everything I lost.

25:02.080 --> 25:05.197
And even then, there are no guarantees.
But it's your only option.

25:05.360 --> 25:09.273
Well, that's not an option. I mean, where
the hell am I gonna find $4 million?

25:09.440 --> 25:13.194
Your house is valued at 3.2, you got
2.6 in equity. That's a good start.

25:13.360 --> 25:15.351
You want me to sell my house?

25:15.520 --> 25:17.033
Julie will...

25:17.200 --> 25:19.919
- She'll leave me.
- Julie cares about you and the kids.

25:20.080 --> 25:22.958
She won't care about losing the house,
if it means keeping you.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.599
Whose wife are we talking about?

25:26.280 --> 25:28.430
No. We gotta come up
with something else.

25:28.600 --> 25:31.478
This is it. This is a gift. Be grateful.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.675
- Grateful?
- Did you think it would just go away?

25:34.840 --> 25:36.910
That there would be no consequences?
Get real.

25:37.080 --> 25:40.436
Who are you to tell me to get real?
You live in a fantasy land.

25:40.600 --> 25:43.637
Your wife is rich. You live in
a house you've never paid for.

25:43.800 --> 25:45.995
You get fired,
Kirsten wouldn't even notice it.

25:46.160 --> 25:50.233
You have no idea what
it's like to provide for a family.

25:52.720 --> 25:57.555
I think there's more to providing
for a family than money.

25:57.840 --> 26:01.992
Wanna be there when Marissa graduates?
You wanna watch Kaitlin grow up?

26:02.160 --> 26:04.720
You can start over.
You can start a new life.

26:05.040 --> 26:08.032
I don't want a new life.
I want my old one back.

26:10.040 --> 26:12.474
But I guess
that's not gonna happen, huh?

26:15.440 --> 26:16.714
- Hey.
- What's up?

26:16.880 --> 26:19.678
Seth Cohen, your friendly
neighborhood pimp, at your service.

26:19.840 --> 26:22.149
I talked with Marissa.
It's totally handled.

26:22.320 --> 26:24.311
I'll be right back with your drinks.

26:24.480 --> 26:25.754
What are you talking about?

26:25.920 --> 26:29.674
It turns out that I'm skilled at getting
a date, provided it's not for me.

26:29.840 --> 26:33.958
You'll have the house to yourself. She'll
be coming over, and you'll be cooking.

26:34.120 --> 26:35.439
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

26:35.600 --> 26:38.239
What's the agenda for tonight?
Any plans?

26:38.400 --> 26:40.118
- Not really, no.
- Anything going on?

26:40.280 --> 26:42.919
There's a lame beach party,
typical Newport scene.

26:43.080 --> 26:45.389
You know what, man? We should go.

26:46.200 --> 26:50.955
No. It's not for me. It's gonna be
water-polo guys and their girlfriends.

26:51.120 --> 26:53.509
I don't get the whole
water-polo thing down here.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.830
Nor do I. A bunch of dudes
who enjoy wearing Speedos.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.117
- What do they know about partying?
- I couldn't agree more.

26:59.440 --> 27:00.873
But the girls are hot.

27:01.040 --> 27:04.635
So with the right attitude
and a couple cocktails, it could be fun.

27:04.800 --> 27:07.439
If it's not, we'll make it fun.
Life is what you make it.

27:08.120 --> 27:10.475
- That's very wise, Donnie.
- Tell you what, man.

27:10.640 --> 27:13.996
Here's what we'll do. We're gonna go.
I'll call a couple of my boys.

27:14.160 --> 27:17.357
We'll drink their beer, dance with
their honeys and have a good time.

27:17.520 --> 27:18.555
- All right.
- All right?

27:18.720 --> 27:20.153
All right.

27:24.400 --> 27:27.358
Enough with the moody scowl thing.
Please, it's not a big deal.

27:27.520 --> 27:30.990
- You're taking him to a Newport party?
- Exactly. It'll be on my turf.

27:31.160 --> 27:35.039
I don't have turf, but if I did, this would
be it. And Summer will be there.

27:35.200 --> 27:38.954
- I don't know about this, Seth.
- I do. It's fine. Not a big deal. I promise.

27:39.120 --> 27:41.998
Now, you got a date, okay?
So you have to go.

27:43.440 --> 27:45.351
Make me proud.

27:47.280 --> 27:48.872
Put a sock on the door.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.433
Hey.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.550
I brought you some leftovers.

28:17.520 --> 28:20.034
It should go well
with the grilled cheese.

28:20.400 --> 28:21.594
My specialty.

28:21.760 --> 28:25.309
- Very fancy.
- Hey, don't knock it till you've tried it.

28:29.280 --> 28:30.793
Dinner is served.

28:40.760 --> 28:42.318
Kind of lame, right?

28:42.480 --> 28:45.711
I'm seeing lots of potential
in here, actually.

28:58.960 --> 29:00.234
Hey.

29:04.440 --> 29:06.510
Where's Marissa?

29:07.040 --> 29:08.553
She's at home.

29:09.680 --> 29:10.954
We're...

29:11.120 --> 29:13.031
...sort of taking a break.

29:13.520 --> 29:15.351
You are?

29:20.280 --> 29:21.952
Are you okay?

29:34.480 --> 29:36.914
That was the best grilled cheese ever.

29:37.080 --> 29:39.275
Yeah. Your mac and cheese
was pretty good too.

29:39.440 --> 29:41.795
Yeah? Well, it tasted better last night.

29:44.960 --> 29:46.791
Hey.

29:51.200 --> 29:54.158
- But, hey, we're here now, right?
- Yeah.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.551
I'm glad we are.

30:00.600 --> 30:02.636
So how are you with everything?

30:02.800 --> 30:05.189
I'm okay, I guess.

30:05.360 --> 30:07.954
I mean, I still don't know
what's gonna happen.

30:08.200 --> 30:10.191
My parents are fighting all the time.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.511
My family's not perfect.

30:15.880 --> 30:18.269
Not even close, but...

30:20.000 --> 30:22.992
...I just don't want us to fall apart.

30:27.600 --> 30:30.353
Let's do something fun.
You can still have fun, right?

30:30.520 --> 30:32.078
I don't know.

30:34.480 --> 30:36.596
What if you don't have a choice?

30:36.760 --> 30:38.637
What does that mean?

30:40.560 --> 30:42.790
No, no, no. Don't. Stop.

30:44.560 --> 30:46.039
Okay.

30:52.440 --> 30:54.158
I'm taking you with me.

31:27.440 --> 31:30.671
What's up, girl?
You don't like to dance?

31:31.000 --> 31:33.036
Not with you.

31:34.680 --> 31:36.796
I'm trying to get to the bar.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.310
You're fine, you know that?

31:39.480 --> 31:40.993
Good one.

31:41.160 --> 31:43.993
But aren't you, like, the busboy?

31:45.360 --> 31:48.397
- Random.
- Who is that guy?

31:49.240 --> 31:51.276
What's up? Somebody got a problem?

31:51.640 --> 31:52.629
Hey, hey.

31:53.320 --> 31:57.029
- What's going on?
- These kids are mad-dogging me.

31:57.400 --> 32:00.756
- Then why don't we go? I'm ready.
- No, I'm ready.

32:03.120 --> 32:07.636
Yeah, what? That's what I'm saying.
Life is what you make it.

32:14.480 --> 32:17.199
Hurry up, I'm freezing.

32:20.440 --> 32:23.955
- You've got goosebumps.
- I know. Towel.

32:24.120 --> 32:25.997
All right. Here.

32:29.600 --> 32:32.319
- You want a sweatshirt?
- No. Can I borrow a tank top...

32:32.480 --> 32:35.711
...so I can look as cool as you?
- Yeah. You wanna go back in the pool?

32:35.880 --> 32:37.199
No.

32:44.960 --> 32:46.712
Do you have to...?

32:49.000 --> 32:50.479
I'm sorry.

32:55.200 --> 32:58.476
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Seth. Donnie's kind of psycho.

33:00.400 --> 33:02.152
Okay, not really a good time
right now.

33:02.320 --> 33:05.995
I wouldn't call if it wasn't serious.
Take my dad's car, meet me at Holly's.

33:07.640 --> 33:09.392
I'll be right there.

33:11.760 --> 33:14.320
Okay. So that was Seth.

33:14.480 --> 33:15.515
I gotta go pick him up.

33:15.680 --> 33:18.877
- He's at Holly's if you want to...
- I can't go there.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.553
Right.

33:21.840 --> 33:23.751
Okay. So...

33:27.120 --> 33:29.031
Sorry. I...

33:29.200 --> 33:30.758
No. It's okay.

33:45.200 --> 33:47.031
You know how long
I've wanted to do this?

33:47.200 --> 33:49.077
As long as I have?

33:50.040 --> 33:52.474
You guys should have
broken up a long time ago.

33:59.360 --> 34:01.316
No. Chill. Chill!

34:01.480 --> 34:02.629
Seriously, relax.

34:02.800 --> 34:05.360
- What's up, bro? You want a drink?
- No, no.

34:05.520 --> 34:06.635
- You sure?
- Yes.

34:06.800 --> 34:08.472
It's vodka, very good. I'll do the...

34:11.679 --> 34:13.716
That sounded expensive.

34:14.440 --> 34:15.839
Come on.

34:17.719 --> 34:19.472
You go. I'II...

34:19.639 --> 34:21.471
I'm right behind you.

34:26.400 --> 34:30.552
- That's my blender!
- Check it out. It's Abercrombie.

34:31.400 --> 34:33.516
Or are you Fitch?

34:33.679 --> 34:36.353
- Jackass, what's your problem?
- You.

34:36.520 --> 34:39.114
- Luke, you really don't want to be...
- Shut up, Cohen.

34:39.280 --> 34:41.190
How'd you get in here anyway?

34:41.960 --> 34:45.077
Look, I don't know who you are.
You best be leaving.

34:45.239 --> 34:47.833
Or what? What you gonna do, man?

34:48.000 --> 34:50.036
What, you afraid I'm gonna
mess up your hair?

34:50.199 --> 34:52.077
- Donnie.
- What's up, Ryan?

34:52.239 --> 34:55.710
Should've figured he's a friend of yours.
Take him back to the trailer park.

34:55.880 --> 34:58.474
- We should go.
- What did you say to me?

34:58.640 --> 35:00.756
All right. Let's go.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.994
What's up now?
Who's the tough guy now?

35:07.040 --> 35:10.237
How much you hate this kid? The way
he talks to you like you're trash?

35:10.800 --> 35:13.872
- What about you, Seth?
- Yeah, he's definitely flawed.

35:14.040 --> 35:17.157
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Look at the role reversal now.

35:17.320 --> 35:19.709
- Who's the bitch?
- Look, you scared him. Put it down.

35:19.880 --> 35:24.510
I'm just trying to have a good time. I'm
trying to have fun. You boys having fun?

35:27.760 --> 35:30.479
What's the matter with you, man?
I was just messing around.

35:30.640 --> 35:32.949
- Oh, my God!
- We gotta go. Let's go.

35:33.800 --> 35:36.792
Oh, my God.
Call an ambulance, somebody!

35:36.960 --> 35:39.269
- You're gonna be okay.
- Call the cops, 911.

35:42.840 --> 35:47.118
I guess this is me.
Thanks for a relaxing weekend, ladies.

35:47.280 --> 35:49.748
I'm off to fire my cleaning lady.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.908
- Okay. See you at spinning.
- Bye, Taryn.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.196
Is it warm in here?

36:07.360 --> 36:09.590
Could you turn the air on, please?

36:10.400 --> 36:13.198
I'm sorry if I upset you.
It wasn't my place.

36:24.400 --> 36:27.756
I remember as a kid,
if I saw a limousine driving...

36:27.920 --> 36:30.480
...I'd always try to see
through the tinted window...

36:30.640 --> 36:33.837
...wondering what kind of life
the people inside lived.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.993
How glamorous and lucky.
Who knew, right?

36:38.920 --> 36:40.399
You knew.

36:41.880 --> 36:44.838
You were probably in there,
staring back at me.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.355
Which means I've been
jealous of you since I was 8.

36:50.480 --> 36:53.836
When I met Jimmy, I had nothing.
No money.

36:55.440 --> 36:57.476
I don't wanna go back
to being nothing again.

36:58.120 --> 36:59.633
You won't.

36:59.800 --> 37:02.758
You have a family, you have Jimmy.
He loves you.

37:05.040 --> 37:06.473
Not as much as he loved you.

37:08.640 --> 37:10.153
But I knew that when I married him.

37:13.120 --> 37:16.908
I was winning the lottery.
Great guy, great life.

37:18.840 --> 37:21.354
And he was doing the honorable thing.

37:25.520 --> 37:27.238
It's your turn, Julie.

37:29.920 --> 37:31.319
Don't abandon him.

37:37.120 --> 37:38.951
Hey. It's me.

37:39.120 --> 37:41.031
Yeah. No.

37:41.840 --> 37:43.432
I'm sorry.

37:43.600 --> 37:45.318
I'm at the hospital.

37:45.480 --> 37:48.392
No. Everything's fine, but...

37:49.160 --> 37:50.991
...I think you'll wanna get down here.

37:54.120 --> 37:55.473
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.517
Hi. How'd it go?

37:57.680 --> 37:59.398
Not well.

37:59.560 --> 38:00.913
How about you?

38:01.080 --> 38:02.559
The same.

38:03.160 --> 38:05.276
Sandy, what happened to our car?

38:06.640 --> 38:08.232
Seth will explain everything.

38:08.400 --> 38:10.834
- Where is he?
- I don't know. He's out, I guess.

38:16.680 --> 38:18.875
You bought beer?

38:21.160 --> 38:22.479
I miss beer.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.508
- Want a sip?
- I want more than that.

38:31.680 --> 38:33.033
Really?

38:34.000 --> 38:36.719
You know, the boys might be out
for a while.

38:44.080 --> 38:45.229
Hey.

38:46.440 --> 38:47.634
I didn't hear you come in.

38:50.440 --> 38:53.000
So how was your weekend?
You win the lottery?

38:54.120 --> 38:55.838
That's funny.

38:58.160 --> 39:01.630
Do you wanna sit or stand?
Because I've got some news.

39:03.520 --> 39:05.397
It's not gonna be easy.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.471
We've... Well...

39:07.640 --> 39:09.870
...you've got a decision to make.

39:11.320 --> 39:12.514
What is it, Jimmy?

39:13.480 --> 39:18.349
We can liquidate our assets,
sell the house...

39:19.880 --> 39:23.509
...and start all over with nothing
as a family.

39:24.480 --> 39:28.029
Or we can declare bankruptcy...

39:28.200 --> 39:29.997
...keep the house...

39:30.160 --> 39:33.869
...and I see you and the girls
in about eight to 10 years.

39:34.880 --> 39:39.112
It's up to you.
Whatever you wanna do, I'll do.

39:41.120 --> 39:44.795
The cops said Donnie wasn't gonna
get far before they caught him.

39:46.000 --> 39:49.993
If you wanna make some extra money,
I'm sure there's a job at the restaurant.

39:50.160 --> 39:55.314
No. That's okay. It'd be good to take
some "me" time, work on the novel.

39:56.240 --> 39:58.390
Tonight would make a good chapter.

40:00.960 --> 40:02.712
Are you scared?

40:05.640 --> 40:07.232
Yeah.

40:11.600 --> 40:13.830
- Hi.
- Hey.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.958
He's okay.
He's with his parents, third floor.

40:17.120 --> 40:18.872
It's just his arm.

40:21.680 --> 40:24.399
So this guy, was he a friend of yours?

40:24.560 --> 40:26.437
No, not really.

40:29.040 --> 40:32.077
- Well, thanks for calling me.
- Yeah.

40:33.200 --> 40:34.553
I...

40:36.480 --> 40:39.631
- I should go.
- I can wait.

40:41.160 --> 40:43.913
No, it's okay. I might be a while.

40:59.240 --> 41:01.754
Never thought the day would end here.

41:02.360 --> 41:03.918
I'm sorry, man.

41:06.160 --> 41:09.038
You were right. I shouldn't have
brought Donnie to that party.

41:09.200 --> 41:13.034
No, it's my fault. If it wasn't for me,
you never would have met him.

41:13.200 --> 41:15.350
Luke wouldn't be in the hospital.

41:15.520 --> 41:19.593
I feel like ever since I got here,
everyone's life's just gotten worse.

41:19.760 --> 41:21.637
Not everyone.

41:23.200 --> 41:26.317
All I was thinking about
in that ambulance was...

41:26.480 --> 41:30.268
...I'm so gone, back to Chino.
Or worse.

41:30.440 --> 41:33.318
You're not going anywhere,
so don't worry about it.

41:34.120 --> 41:36.793
I do think from now on, though,
we gotta stick together...

41:36.960 --> 41:40.873
...because united we're unstoppable,
but divided it's like...

41:41.040 --> 41:43.713
- People get shot.
- That's what I'm saying.

41:43.880 --> 41:45.791
That's what I'm saying.
