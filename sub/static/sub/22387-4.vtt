05:57.591 --> 05:58.790
now, this right here is a new
invention of mine.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.726
Invention of mine.
Last time I tried it out,

06:00.728 --> 06:02.060
last time I tried it out,
it didn't exactly go well,

06:02.062 --> 06:03.428
it didn't exactly go well,
but hopefully it will work

06:03.430 --> 06:03.895
but hopefully it will work
tonight.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.630
Tonight.
This is the amazing twist-a-roo

06:05.632 --> 06:13.071
this is the amazing twist-a-roo
3179.314279365123...5.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.539
3179.314279365123...5.
As you can see, my arm

06:14.541 --> 06:15.807
as you can see, my arm
goes all the way inside, and

06:15.809 --> 06:16.775
goes all the way inside, and
if I open this up, you can see

06:16.777 --> 06:17.943
if I open this up, you can see
my arm is real, correct?

06:17.945 --> 06:18.610
My arm is real, correct?
>> Yes, yes.

06:18.612 --> 06:19.194
>> Yes, yes.
>> Do you mind to make sure

06:19.195 --> 06:19.777
>> do you mind to make sure
it's real?

06:19.780 --> 06:20.645
It's real?
>> Sure.

06:20.647 --> 06:21.113
>> Sure.
>> [Both yelp]

06:21.115 --> 06:22.647
>> [Both yelp]
>> [Laughs] It's a joke.

06:22.649 --> 06:23.882
>> [Laughs] It's a joke.
It's a joke.

06:23.884 --> 06:24.950
It's a joke.
Now, what's going to happen is,

06:24.952 --> 06:26.451
now, what's going to happen is,
Jonathan, is you're going to

06:26.453 --> 06:30.856
Jonathan, is you're going to
take that portion of the box.

06:30.858 --> 06:31.790
Take that portion of the box.
And you're going to start

06:31.792 --> 06:33.024
and you're going to start
twisting it nice and slowly

06:33.026 --> 06:35.394
twisting it nice and slowly
in a sort of clockwise,

06:35.396 --> 06:36.061
in a sort of clockwise,
circular motion.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.429
Circular motion.
About three times,

06:37.431 --> 06:38.730
about three times,
or until I start screaming out

06:38.732 --> 06:40.132
or until I start screaming out
in pain, telling you to stop.

06:40.134 --> 06:40.966
In pain, telling you to stop.
Okay?

06:40.968 --> 06:41.833
Okay?
So I'm gonna put

06:41.835 --> 06:43.435
so I'm gonna put
my arm in again.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.453
My arm in again.
So if you'd like to take that

06:44.454 --> 06:45.470
so if you'd like to take that
portion of the box and start

06:45.472 --> 06:46.972
portion of the box and start
twisting on the count of three.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.840
Twisting on the count of three.
One, two, three. Go.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.976
One, two, three. Go.
[Groaning] Once.

06:50.978 --> 06:53.979
[Groaning] Once.
[Groans] Twice.

06:53.981 --> 06:57.949
[Groans] Twice.
[Groans] Three times a lady.

06:57.951 --> 06:58.850
[Groans] Three times a lady.
There we go.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.419
There we go.
I think that's enough.

07:00.421 --> 07:00.886
I think that's enough.
Oh, gosh.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.954
Oh, gosh.
Oh.

07:02.956 --> 07:03.622
Oh.
Oh, dear.

07:03.624 --> 07:04.856
Oh, dear.
If you'd like to just hold

07:04.858 --> 07:05.891
if you'd like to just hold
that portion of the box.

07:05.893 --> 07:08.160
That portion of the box.
You seem to have, uh...

07:08.162 --> 07:09.594
You seem to have, uh...
This didn't happen last time,

07:09.596 --> 07:12.063
this didn't happen last time,
but you've really hurt me.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.498
But you've really hurt me.
Gosh!

07:13.500 --> 07:13.965
Gosh!
>> I'm sorry.

07:13.967 --> 07:14.900
>> I'm sorry.
You got to get out.

07:14.902 --> 07:18.470
You got to get out.
[Applause]

07:18.472 --> 07:20.038
[Applause]
>> That's not meant to happen.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.073
>> That's not meant to happen.
Now, let's try and reverse

07:22.075 --> 07:22.941
now, let's try and reverse
the process.

07:22.943 --> 07:23.775
The process.
Twist it round the other way

07:23.777 --> 07:24.443
twist it round the other way
if you like.

07:24.445 --> 07:24.910
If you like.
Here we go.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.978
Here we go.
[Gasps and groans]

07:26.980 --> 07:27.879
[Gasps and groans]
Keep going.

07:27.881 --> 07:30.816
Keep going.
[Groans] Twice.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.150
[Groans] Twice.
And one more time.

07:32.152 --> 07:33.585
And one more time.
Ugh, there we go.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.153
Ugh, there we go.
And hopefully...

07:35.155 --> 07:37.155
And hopefully...
My arm is completely back

07:37.157 --> 07:38.023
my arm is completely back
to normal.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.658
To normal.
There we go.

07:39.660 --> 07:40.125
There we go.
I'm okay.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.526

07:56.577 --> 07:58.543
let's give penn and teller
a couple minutes to talk.

07:58.545 --> 07:59.244
A couple minutes to talk.
Have you ever been to Vegas

07:59.245 --> 07:59.944
have you ever been to Vegas
before?

07:59.947 --> 08:01.012
Before?
>> I've never been to Vegas.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.614
>> I've never been to Vegas.
It would be quite amazing

08:02.616 --> 08:03.081
it would be quite amazing
if I did.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.049
If I did.
>> I would so love it if,

08:04.051 --> 08:05.650
>> I would so love it if,
as a result of the show, we got

08:08.255 --> 08:09.254
To Vegas to fully enjoy it.
Because I think...

08:09.256 --> 08:10.856
Because I think...
[Laughter]

08:10.858 --> 08:12.157
[Laughter]
I think it could be one hell of

08:12.159 --> 08:14.192
I think it could be one hell of
an experience for you.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.760
An experience for you.
Well, you did it all fabulously.

08:15.762 --> 08:16.962
Well, you did it all fabulously.
And the personality you have

08:16.964 --> 08:18.063
and the personality you have
onstage and the warmth you give

08:18.065 --> 08:19.598
onstage and the warmth you give
off and the humor, that's a huge

08:19.600 --> 08:20.065
off and the humor, that's a huge
selling thing.

08:20.067 --> 08:20.999
Selling thing.
I mean, that's what people

08:21.001 --> 08:22.801
I mean, that's what people
would love to see you doing.

08:22.803 --> 08:25.937
Would love to see you doing.
You know, in a way, the magic

08:25.939 --> 08:27.005
you know, in a way, the magic
isn't the best part of the act.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.206
Isn't the best part of the act.
You're the best part of the act.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.207
You're the best part of the act.
And I thought it was great.

08:29.209 --> 08:30.075
And I thought it was great.
Congratulations.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.877
Congratulations.
It was really great fun.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.178

Let's see if penn and teller

08:33.179 --> 08:34.779
let's see if penn and teller
have got a clue.

08:34.780 --> 08:35.914
Have got a clue.
>> You just said something

08:35.916 --> 08:37.549
>> you just said something
dead wrong.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.049
Dead wrong.
You said the magic wasn't

08:39.052 --> 08:40.919
you said the magic wasn't
the best part of his act.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.020
The best part of his act.
And I got to tell you.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.022
And I got to tell you.
Some of the stuff in there,

08:44.024 --> 08:45.023
some of the stuff in there,
the more you know,

08:45.025 --> 08:46.558
the more you know,
the better it was.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.159
The better it was.
The opening trick he did

08:48.161 --> 08:50.795
the opening trick he did
I have seen Lance Burton,

08:50.797 --> 08:54.065
I have seen Lance Burton,
master magician, star of his own

08:54.067 --> 08:55.934
master magician, star of his own
Vegas show forever--I've seen

08:55.936 --> 08:56.835
Vegas show forever--I've seen
him do that.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.036
Him do that.
We've both seen him do that.

08:58.038 --> 09:01.573
We've both seen him do that.
And his ending was not as good.

09:01.575 --> 09:02.941
And his ending was not as good.
Is that ending your own?

09:02.943 --> 09:03.608
Is that ending your own?
>> No.

09:03.610 --> 09:04.075
>> No.
>> Okay.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.278
>> Okay.
[Laughter]

09:06.280 --> 09:07.145
[Laughter]
>> That's another great thing.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.146
>> That's another great thing.
He's honest.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.014
He's honest.
That's very rare

09:09.016 --> 09:12.083
that's very rare
in show business.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.719
In show business.
>> You sold that so completely,

09:14.721 --> 09:15.954
>> you sold that so completely,
I was sure that the ending

09:15.956 --> 09:17.122
I was sure that the ending
of that was your own

09:17.124 --> 09:18.323
of that was your own
'cause your acting was just

09:18.325 --> 09:19.157
'cause your acting was just
beautiful on it.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.560
Beautiful on it.
I also want to say, about the

09:21.562 --> 09:23.929
I also want to say, about the
hand thing you did, what I love

09:23.931 --> 09:25.730
hand thing you did, what I love
about that is, you weren't

09:25.732 --> 09:28.099
about that is, you weren't
finding some other child

09:28.101 --> 09:30.101
finding some other child
to torture, but you did it

09:30.103 --> 09:31.102
to torture, but you did it
to yourself.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.038
To yourself.
So you were the star of the

09:33.040 --> 09:35.040
so you were the star of the
trick and the victim of the

09:35.042 --> 09:37.275
trick and the victim of the
trick, and I always love that.

09:37.277 --> 09:38.577
Trick, and I always love that.
And I also want to tell you

09:38.579 --> 09:40.011
and I also want to tell you
something, Daniel,

09:40.013 --> 09:41.046
something, Daniel,
really from the bottom

09:41.048 --> 09:41.880
really from the bottom
of my heart.

09:41.882 --> 09:44.115
Of my heart.
I want you to look right now

09:44.117 --> 09:45.317

Path you're on.
If you don't like what you see

here...

09:52.059 --> 09:54.059

'cause we can show you pictures

10:05.138 --> 10:07.739
'cause we can show you pictures
of teller doing shows when he

10:07.741 --> 10:10.041

was your age, and it's exactly

10:10.043 --> 10:11.076
was your age, and it's exactly
the same.

10:11.078 --> 10:13.812
The same.
And I was doing the same stuff

10:13.814 --> 10:14.813
and I was doing the same stuff
when I was 15.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.681
When I was 15.
I just wasn't quite as good.

10:16.683 --> 10:19.718
I just wasn't quite as good.

I'm a street entertainer.
I told you stop stalking me.

11:25.252 --> 11:26.718
I told you stop stalking me.
Why do you do it?

11:26.720 --> 11:28.720
Why do you do it?
I get enjoyment out of

I get enjoyment out of
performing magic on the streets

11:30.257 --> 11:31.723
performing magic on the streets
for people that could not afford

11:31.725 --> 11:34.225
for people that could not afford
to see me if I was famous.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.727
To see me if I was famous.
That's why I do it.

11:35.729 --> 11:36.895
That's why I do it.
Every time I see that man,

Yeah.
Describe my style of magic

11:40.801 --> 11:42.267
describe my style of magic
would be very controversial,

11:42.269 --> 11:45.837
would be very controversial,
in your face, like white boy

11:45.839 --> 11:47.138
in your face, like white boy
mock atmosphere.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.406
Mock atmosphere.
Yeah, yeah, no, stop it.

11:48.408 --> 11:49.474
Yeah, yeah, no, stop it.
I know it's on the stick.

11:49.476 --> 11:50.375
I know it's on the stick.
Shut up.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.342
Shut up.
I have a lot of passion

11:51.344 --> 11:52.711
I have a lot of passion
for what I do.

11:52.713 --> 11:53.712
For what I do.
But it's a gift.

11:53.714 --> 11:55.013
But it's a gift.

11:56.983 --> 11:57.882
Fake it last night?"
She said, "no, I really was

11:57.884 --> 11:58.349
she said, "no, I really was
asleep."

11:58.351 --> 11:59.350
Asleep."
You know, I've been everywhere.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.119
You know, I've been everywhere.

12:06.159 --> 12:06.825

to do that.

12:06.827 --> 12:07.425
To do that.
Cheer up, sir.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.060
Cheer up, sir.
You wanted kids.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.962

I'm not really a mean person.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.271
I'm not really a mean person.
It's just the way my character

choice by going, "pick <i> a</i> cup."

14:49.489 --> 14:50.321

Thank you.

15:12.378 --> 15:16.014
Two on the bottom, one on top.
That's my favorite position.

15:19.018 --> 15:21.019
Is this the way it's gonna be?

15:24.657 --> 15:34.299
[Applause]
There's too many balls to begin

15:34.301 --> 15:35.466
there's too many balls to begin
with, so what I'm gonna do is

15:35.468 --> 15:38.202
with, so what I'm gonna do is
eliminate a few, which makes

15:38.204 --> 15:39.170
eliminate a few, which makes
the game a little bit easier

15:39.172 --> 15:43.508
the game a little bit easier
to follow.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.176
To follow.
So we have one ball there,

15:45.178 --> 15:47.078
so we have one ball there,
one ball there.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.046
One ball there.
Darren, would you mind standing

15:48.048 --> 15:49.047
Darren, would you mind standing

15:49.049 --> 15:49.514
For me, please?
>> Certainly.

15:49.516 --> 15:50.415

about your shirt.

15:52.352 --> 15:53.351
About your shirt.
Okay?

15:53.353 --> 15:54.452
Okay?

15:54.454 --> 15:55.453
Darren, how many balls are being
used throughout?

15:55.455 --> 15:56.387
Used throughout?
>> Three.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.422
>> Three.
>> Three, yeah.

15:57.424 --> 15:58.690

Okay, so how many balls are

15:58.692 --> 16:00.224

16:01.027 --> 16:02.026
>> One.
>> One, okay.

16:02.028 --> 16:03.394

So if I eliminate this one

16:03.396 --> 16:05.463
so if I eliminate this one
from the game...

16:05.465 --> 16:06.497
From the game...
How many balls will it leave

16:06.499 --> 16:07.332
how many balls will it leave
left in the game?

16:07.334 --> 16:08.399
Left in the game?
>> Two.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.134
>> Two.
>> Correct.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.302
>> Correct.
But if I eliminate this one

16:11.304 --> 16:12.637
but if I eliminate this one
from the game, how many balls

16:12.639 --> 16:14.005
from the game, how many balls
will it left in the game?

16:14.007 --> 16:14.739
Will it left in the game?
>> One.

16:14.741 --> 16:15.573

16:15.575 --> 16:16.474

>> In the middle.
>> In the middle. There you are.

16:18.011 --> 16:19.377
>> In the middle. There you are.
I put this one away, but how

16:19.379 --> 16:20.511
I put this one away, but how
come, Darren, this one's back

16:20.513 --> 16:22.013
come, Darren, this one's back
so quick?

16:22.015 --> 16:23.214
So quick?
Well, I tell you, Darren,

16:23.216 --> 16:23.832
well, I tell you, Darren,
because what I do is sleight

16:23.833 --> 16:24.449
because what I do is sleight
of hand.

16:24.451 --> 16:25.483
Of hand.
I don't take the ball

16:25.485 --> 16:26.551
I don't take the ball
and put it here.

16:26.553 --> 16:27.719
And put it here.
I just manipulate it in such

16:27.721 --> 16:28.686
I just manipulate it in such
a way that you think it's

16:28.688 --> 16:30.021
a way that you think it's
going away.

16:30.023 --> 16:32.256
Going away.
But I keep it palmed, yeah?

16:32.258 --> 16:34.125
But I keep it palmed, yeah?
There's no ball here, but when I

16:34.127 --> 16:35.560
there's no ball here, but when I
lift up the cup, what happens,

16:35.562 --> 16:36.527
lift up the cup, what happens,
I drop the ball from the

16:36.529 --> 16:37.495
I drop the ball from the
back of the cup, create the

16:37.497 --> 16:38.529
back of the cup, create the
illusion that I come from the

16:38.531 --> 16:40.365
illusion that I come from the
cup, you stupid audience...

16:40.367 --> 16:43.334

17:37.223 --> 17:39.057
I cover up the ball.
And the ball is gonna vanish.

17:39.059 --> 17:39.808
And the ball is gonna vanish.
How many balls under the hat,

23:31.477 --> 23:32.143
to need to make a table,
like a human table.

23:32.145 --> 23:33.177
Like a human table.
So I will be using you

23:33.179 --> 23:34.912
so I will be using you
for part of this, and we need

23:34.914 --> 23:36.046
for part of this, and we need
one other person, so...

23:36.048 --> 23:37.081
One other person, so...
>> From that side, you'd like?

23:37.083 --> 23:38.182
>> From that side, you'd like?
>> From any side you like.

23:38.184 --> 23:39.183
>> From any side you like.
If you could grab them,

23:39.185 --> 23:39.950
if you could grab them,
I'll explain what's going

23:39.952 --> 23:40.618
I'll explain what's going
to happen.

23:40.620 --> 23:41.302
To happen.
>> Who would like to do it?

23:41.303 --> 23:41.985
>> Who would like to do it?
Which of the ladies here

23:41.988 --> 23:42.653
which of the ladies here
would like to do it?

23:42.655 --> 23:43.120
Would like to do it?
Lady there.

23:43.122 --> 23:43.988
Lady there.
What's your name?

23:43.990 --> 23:44.655
What's your name?
>> Rema.

23:44.657 --> 23:45.990
>> Rema.
>> Rema, ladies and gentlemen.

23:45.992 --> 23:48.959
>> Rema, ladies and gentlemen.
[Applause]

23:51.930 --> 23:56.167
>> What was your name again?
Great, for this, I may as well

23:56.169 --> 23:58.903
great, for this, I may as well
explain the sort of genesis

23:58.905 --> 24:00.171
explain the sort of genesis
of this for me.

24:00.173 --> 24:01.539
Of this for me.
Now, most magicians will

24:01.541 --> 24:03.140
now, most magicians will
practice either with cards

24:03.142 --> 24:04.508
practice either with cards
or coins.

24:04.510 --> 24:06.510
Or coins.
I like to practice with both.

24:06.512 --> 24:07.445
I like to practice with both.
So I have something I carry

24:07.447 --> 24:08.679
so I have something I carry
around a lot.

24:08.681 --> 24:09.947
Around a lot.
For this, we also need a nice,

24:09.949 --> 24:12.116
for this, we also need a nice,
big, Fluffy mat and a nice, big,

24:12.118 --> 24:13.150
big, Fluffy mat and a nice, big,
hard table.

24:13.152 --> 24:15.085
Hard table.
And the reason being is, we will

24:15.087 --> 24:17.121
and the reason being is, we will
place the coins out into a nice

24:17.123 --> 24:18.689
place the coins out into a nice
little sort of square.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.191
Little sort of square.
And you cover each one of these

24:20.193 --> 24:21.692
and you cover each one of these
up, okay?

24:21.694 --> 24:22.493
Up, okay?
Now, what's going to happen,

24:22.495 --> 24:23.160
now, what's going to happen,
as you start to cover all

24:23.162 --> 24:24.195
as you start to cover all
of these up, you're gonna jump

24:24.197 --> 24:25.563
of these up, you're gonna jump
everything about.

24:25.565 --> 24:26.730
Everything about.
And it works in a very simple

24:26.732 --> 24:28.098
and it works in a very simple
matter just like this.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.901
Matter just like this.
If you tap, that will jump.

24:30.903 --> 24:32.470
If you tap, that will jump.
Sure, and a bit of applause, but

24:32.472 --> 24:35.639
sure, and a bit of applause, but
it's very--it's all very--

24:35.641 --> 24:36.740
it's very--it's all very--
now, again, all the magician

24:36.742 --> 24:37.825
now, again, all the magician
would do is, he would do this

24:37.826 --> 24:38.909
would do is, he would do this
with all four of these, and he

24:38.911 --> 24:39.877
with all four of these, and he
would clink and everything

24:39.879 --> 24:41.812
would clink and everything
would jump out of the way,

24:41.814 --> 24:43.247
would jump out of the way,
but...

24:43.249 --> 24:45.883
But...
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

24:45.885 --> 24:46.951
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't applaud that.

24:46.953 --> 24:47.985
Don't applaud that.
Don't applaud that, because,

24:47.987 --> 24:49.687
don't applaud that, because,
in this one, you need the cards.

24:49.689 --> 24:50.488
In this one, you need the cards.
You need the coins.

24:50.490 --> 24:51.689
You need the coins.
You need the big Fluffy mat.

24:51.691 --> 24:52.756
You need the big Fluffy mat.
In fact, the mat's the most

24:52.758 --> 24:54.158
in fact, the mat's the most
important thing.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.159
Important thing.
What that lets you do is

24:55.161 --> 24:56.193
what that lets you do is
sneakily put your thumb

24:56.195 --> 24:57.495
sneakily put your thumb
on things and pick it up.

24:57.497 --> 24:58.963
On things and pick it up.
As you're picking up

24:58.965 --> 25:00.030
as you're picking up
with the cards and things

25:00.032 --> 25:01.999
with the cards and things
like that, you can also slide

25:02.001 --> 25:03.033
like that, you can also slide
stuff along.

25:03.035 --> 25:04.168
Stuff along.
So I've decided to try

25:04.170 --> 25:06.036
so I've decided to try
and figure out a way that will

25:06.038 --> 25:08.272
and figure out a way that will
get rid of the big Fluffy mat,

25:08.274 --> 25:11.141
get rid of the big Fluffy mat,
the table, and basically

25:11.143 --> 25:12.743
the table, and basically
everything that we don't need.

25:12.745 --> 25:14.111
Everything that we don't need.
So what I've decided to do is

25:14.113 --> 25:17.214
so what I've decided to do is
take the mat and get rid of it.

25:17.216 --> 25:17.882
Take the mat and get rid of it.
I was aiming

25:17.884 --> 25:18.582
I was aiming
for your head there.

25:18.584 --> 25:20.251
For your head there.
Did I miss?

25:20.253 --> 25:21.085
Did I miss?
>> It's too high for you,

25:21.087 --> 25:21.752
>> it's too high for you,
isn't it?

25:21.754 --> 25:24.955
Isn't it?
[Laughter]

25:24.957 --> 25:27.925
[Laughter]
[Applause]

25:30.896 --> 25:32.296
>> So to do this--if you can
have a wee sit over here.

25:32.298 --> 25:32.963
Have a wee sit over here.
>> Go and sit down.

25:32.965 --> 25:33.614
>> Go and sit down.
>> If you'd follow me, my dear.

25:33.615 --> 25:34.264
>> If you'd follow me, my dear.
Thank you.

25:34.267 --> 25:35.533
Thank you.
Just have a little seat there.

25:35.535 --> 25:36.233
Just have a little seat there.
>> Rema.

25:36.235 --> 25:37.201
>> Rema.
>> Could you sit down for us,

25:37.203 --> 25:39.303
>> could you sit down for us,
big boy?

25:39.305 --> 25:40.704
Big boy?
There you go.

25:40.706 --> 25:42.139
There you go.
And what I need you to do

25:42.141 --> 25:43.240
and what I need you to do
is make a human table.

25:43.242 --> 25:44.108
Is make a human table.
Are you aware to how you

25:44.110 --> 25:44.775
are you aware to how you
do this?

25:44.777 --> 25:46.076
Do this?
>> No, but I'm game.

25:46.078 --> 25:46.777
>> No, but I'm game.
>> Great.

25:46.779 --> 25:48.746
>> Great.
>> [Laughs]

25:48.748 --> 25:50.648
>> [Laughs]
>> Shall I...

25:50.650 --> 25:53.617
>> Shall I...
[Laughter]

25:55.120 --> 25:57.321
Sit down, you.
If you could be so kind as to

25:57.323 --> 25:58.556
if you could be so kind as to
put your hands out just like

25:58.558 --> 25:59.890
put your hands out just like
that for me.

25:59.892 --> 26:00.691
That for me.
And I'm gonna tuck the label

26:00.693 --> 26:01.191
and I'm gonna tuck the label
of your tie in.

26:01.193 --> 26:02.159
Of your tie in.
>> Thank you.

26:02.161 --> 26:03.044
>> Thank you.
>> That way, I won't know

26:03.045 --> 26:03.928
>> that way, I won't know
it's from primark.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.296
It's from primark.
If you could do the same.

26:05.298 --> 26:06.096
If you could do the same.
Thank you.

26:06.098 --> 26:07.131
Thank you.
And then what we need to do

26:07.133 --> 26:08.566
and then what we need to do
is just to place a coin

26:08.568 --> 26:09.333
is just to place a coin
on each.

26:09.335 --> 26:10.301
On each.
Now, I need to make sure it's

26:10.303 --> 26:11.969
now, I need to make sure it's
tail side up for my ocd

26:11.971 --> 26:13.837
tail side up for my ocd
or I'll go mental.

26:13.839 --> 26:15.673
Or I'll go mental.
And we also need the cover.

26:15.675 --> 26:16.840
And we also need the cover.
So the cover, again, would be

26:16.842 --> 26:19.643
so the cover, again, would be
our little cards.

26:19.645 --> 26:20.811
Our little cards.
Now, again, it's gonna work

26:20.813 --> 26:21.612
now, again, it's gonna work
the exact same way.

26:21.614 --> 26:23.981
The exact same way.
But if I try and slide this now,

26:23.983 --> 26:25.249
but if I try and slide this now,
it will obviously fall and hit

26:25.251 --> 26:25.916
it will obviously fall and hit
the floor.

26:25.918 --> 26:26.751
The floor.
In fact, can you put your hand

26:26.752 --> 26:27.585
in fact, can you put your hand
down a bit?

26:27.587 --> 26:29.086
Down a bit?
I told you I'm not that tall.

26:29.088 --> 26:29.787
I told you I'm not that tall.
Perfect.

26:29.789 --> 26:31.288
Perfect.
That one there.

26:31.290 --> 26:32.890
That one there.
There we are.

26:32.892 --> 26:34.024
There we are.
And, again, if I try and do it

26:34.026 --> 26:36.594
and, again, if I try and do it
now, this means if I tap

26:36.596 --> 26:37.661
now, this means if I tap
this one with that card

26:37.663 --> 26:38.629
this one with that card
and that one with that card,

26:38.631 --> 26:39.363
and that one with that card,
you should both be able to

26:39.365 --> 26:42.333
you should both be able to
feel everything happen.

26:42.335 --> 26:43.000
Feel everything happen.
>> Wow.

26:43.002 --> 26:46.770
>> Wow.
[Applause]

26:46.772 --> 26:48.305
[Applause]
>> Across your hand is the

26:48.307 --> 26:49.707
>> across your hand is the
receiving hand over here.

26:49.709 --> 26:50.341
Receiving hand over here.
We'll try to let you feel

26:50.343 --> 26:51.208
we'll try to let you feel
both of these.

26:51.210 --> 26:52.176
Both of these.
So if you just click,

26:52.178 --> 26:53.010
so if you just click,
you should be able to feel

26:53.011 --> 26:53.843
you should be able to feel
both as it jumps,

26:53.846 --> 26:56.246
both as it jumps,
now leaving three over here.

26:56.248 --> 26:57.348
Now leaving three over here.
And for the very last one--

26:57.350 --> 26:58.315
and for the very last one--
let me just try and see if I

26:58.317 --> 27:00.351
let me just try and see if I
can do this--you can pop it

27:00.353 --> 27:01.018
can do this--you can pop it
and it will jump

27:01.020 --> 27:01.986
and it will jump
all the way over.

27:01.988 --> 27:04.955
All the way over.
[Cheers and applause]

27:09.894 --> 27:11.295
>> That was awesome.
>> Thank you very much.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.363
>> Thank you very much.
Thank you.

27:12.365 --> 27:13.263
Thank you.
>> Thank you.

27:13.265 --> 27:16.100
>> Thank you.
Rema, ladies and gentlemen.

27:16.102 --> 27:18.335
Rema, ladies and gentlemen.
That was incredible.

27:18.337 --> 27:19.069
That was incredible.
While we got the chairs,

27:19.071 --> 27:20.671
while we got the chairs,
why don't we--we can still

27:20.673 --> 27:21.338
why don't we--we can still
use the chairs.

27:21.340 --> 27:22.339
Use the chairs.
We'll let penn and teller

27:22.341 --> 27:23.107
we'll let penn and teller
confer there for a bit.

27:23.108 --> 27:23.874
Confer there for a bit.
And I've known penn and teller

27:23.876 --> 27:25.309
and I've known penn and teller
on and off for about 20 years,

27:25.311 --> 27:26.410
on and off for about 20 years,
and it's only in the last six

27:26.412 --> 27:27.411
and it's only in the last six
months or so that penn has

27:27.413 --> 27:28.946
months or so that penn has
started understanding me

27:28.948 --> 27:29.413
started understanding me
most of the time.

27:29.415 --> 27:30.280
Most of the time.
>> Yeah.

27:30.282 --> 27:32.349
>> Yeah.
>> As you say, for him--

27:32.351 --> 27:33.417
>> as you say, for him--
when we're speaking now,

27:33.419 --> 27:34.351
when we're speaking now,
for him, what he hears is

27:34.353 --> 27:35.219
for him, what he hears is
[Babbling] ra, da, da, da, ga,

27:35.221 --> 27:35.886
[babbling] Ra, da, da, da, ga,
ga, da, da.

27:35.888 --> 27:36.353
Ga, da, da.
That's what he--

27:36.355 --> 27:37.421
that's what he--
>> it's a completely different

27:37.423 --> 27:38.088
>> it's a completely different
language.

27:38.090 --> 27:38.989
Language.
>> It's like two ducks

27:38.990 --> 27:39.889
>> it's like two ducks
sitting out in front of him

27:39.892 --> 27:41.091
sitting out in front of him
as far as he's concerned.

27:41.093 --> 27:41.742
As far as he's concerned.
I think you're in with a pretty

27:41.743 --> 27:42.392
I think you're in with a pretty
good chance.

27:42.395 --> 27:43.360
Good chance.
I'm gonna ask--I'm gonna jump in

27:43.362 --> 27:45.295
I'm gonna ask--I'm gonna jump in
now I think.

27:45.297 --> 27:46.697
Now I think.
>> We just have to ask you

27:46.699 --> 27:53.070
>> we just have to ask you
one question, and, uh...

27:53.072 --> 27:55.406
One question, and, uh...
If we're wrong about this,

27:55.408 --> 27:56.707
if we're wrong about this,
you have fooled us.

27:56.709 --> 27:58.275
You have fooled us.
We're not going to try to sneak

27:58.277 --> 28:00.778
we're not going to try to sneak
in a second guess because we

28:00.780 --> 28:03.380
in a second guess because we
don't have a second guess.

28:03.382 --> 28:05.315
Don't have a second guess.
If we don't know this,

28:05.317 --> 28:06.083
if we don't know this,
you've fooled us.

28:06.085 --> 28:07.384
You've fooled us.
Would you just hold your hands

28:07.386 --> 28:09.219
would you just hold your hands
up like this?

28:09.221 --> 28:11.889
Up like this?
And just tell us--just honestly,

28:11.891 --> 28:13.857
and just tell us--just honestly,
I guess, could you do that

28:13.859 --> 28:16.393
I guess, could you do that
routine exactly the same if

28:16.395 --> 28:18.896
routine exactly the same if
you took off all your jewelry?

28:18.898 --> 28:20.431
You took off all your jewelry?
>> What jewelry are you--

28:20.433 --> 28:22.032
>> what jewelry are you--
>> rings.

28:22.034 --> 28:22.966
>> Rings.
>> Bang on, bud, yeah.

28:22.968 --> 28:25.703
>> Bang on, bud, yeah.
>> Okay.

28:25.705 --> 28:26.437
>> Okay.
And I also have to add,

28:26.439 --> 28:28.372
and I also have to add,
he--he also fooled me.

28:28.374 --> 28:29.239
He--he also fooled me.
>> He fooled you?

28:29.241 --> 28:30.240
>> He fooled you?
>> It was another teller one.

28:30.242 --> 28:32.910
>> It was another teller one.
>> Wow.

28:32.912 --> 28:33.911
>> Wow.
He's too smart.

34:18.424 --> 34:20.290
Wasn't that spectacular?
Romany, what a great

34:20.292 --> 34:21.123
romany, what a great
performance.

34:21.126 --> 34:21.625
Performance.
That was great.

34:21.627 --> 34:22.492
That was great.
>> Thank you.

34:22.494 --> 34:23.427
>> Thank you.
>> Wow.

34:23.429 --> 34:26.429
>> Wow.
[Applause]

34:26.431 --> 34:29.733
[Applause]
>> [Sighs]

34:29.735 --> 34:30.667
>> [Sighs]
>> And I can tell you, I didn't

34:30.668 --> 34:31.467
>> and I can tell you, I didn't
do anything to help her.

34:31.469 --> 34:32.369
Do anything to help her.
I didn't take my jacket off.

34:32.371 --> 34:33.335
I didn't take my jacket off.
I didn't do anything.

34:33.338 --> 34:34.704
I didn't do anything.
That was a terrific performance.

34:34.706 --> 34:35.639
That was a terrific performance.
I don't know whether the guys

34:35.641 --> 34:36.540
I don't know whether the guys
have worked it out.

34:36.542 --> 34:38.275
Have worked it out.
They look quite content

34:38.277 --> 34:39.141
they look quite content
over there, but maybe they're

34:39.143 --> 34:40.210
over there, but maybe they're
just enjoying the view.

34:40.212 --> 34:41.210
Just enjoying the view.
Penn, teller?

34:41.213 --> 34:42.545
Penn, teller?
Do you know how she did it?

34:42.547 --> 34:44.481
Do you know how she did it?
>> As far as the rope tie,

34:44.483 --> 34:46.449
>> as far as the rope tie,
this was used extensively

34:46.452 --> 34:48.819
this was used extensively
in spirit cabinets, where people

34:48.821 --> 34:50.454
in spirit cabinets, where people
would be tied up like this by

34:50.456 --> 34:51.822
would be tied up like this by
a committee from the audience,

34:51.824 --> 34:53.456
a committee from the audience,
then put in a cabinet.

34:53.458 --> 34:55.525
Then put in a cabinet.
And it was all done to prove

34:55.527 --> 34:56.293
and it was all done to prove
the existence

34:56.295 --> 34:57.461
the existence
of the spirit world.

34:57.463 --> 34:59.796
Of the spirit world.
It's wonderful for it to be done

34:59.798 --> 35:01.798
it's wonderful for it to be done
with sexual flirtation instead,

35:01.800 --> 35:03.500
with sexual flirtation instead,
something good instead of

35:03.502 --> 35:04.501
something good instead of
something evil.

35:04.503 --> 35:05.669
Something evil.
It's a variation

35:05.671 --> 35:07.637
it's a variation
on the kellar rope tie.

35:07.639 --> 35:09.372
On the kellar rope tie.
I think you'll recognize that.

35:09.374 --> 35:10.640
I think you'll recognize that.
And then all you need is

35:10.642 --> 35:12.509
and then all you need is
someone who is compliant

35:12.511 --> 35:14.111
someone who is compliant
and bends to your every whim,

35:14.113 --> 35:15.846
and bends to your every whim,
like Jonathan Ross.

35:15.848 --> 35:17.581
Like Jonathan Ross.
It was wonderfully done.

35:17.583 --> 35:20.517
It was wonderfully done.
>> Happy to oblige.

35:20.519 --> 35:21.351
>> Happy to oblige.
[Cheers and applause]

35:21.353 --> 35:22.452
[Cheers and applause]
>> Ladies and gentlemen,

35:22.454 --> 35:23.653
>> ladies and gentlemen,
she was fabulous, wasn't she?

35:23.655 --> 35:24.488
She was fabulous, wasn't she?
She didn't fool them,

35:24.490 --> 35:25.555
she didn't fool them,
but it was a great act.

35:25.557 --> 35:27.224
But it was a great act.
Romany!

35:27.226 --> 35:29.526
Romany!
[Cheers and applause]

35:29.528 --> 35:30.427

35:32.364 --> 35:34.264
Thank you so much.
Okay, it's break time again.

35:34.266 --> 35:35.365
Okay, it's break time again.
But don't go away 'cause we will

35:35.367 --> 35:36.399
but don't go away 'cause we will
be right back here with a trick

35:36.401 --> 35:38.368
be right back here with a trick
where penn encases poor teller's

35:38.370 --> 35:41.138
where penn encases poor teller's
head in a solid concrete block.

35:41.140 --> 35:43.607
Head in a solid concrete block.
See you soon.

35:55.686 --> 35:59.389
>> Thank you so much.
Welcome back to <i> fool us.</i>

35:59.391 --> 36:00.357
Welcome back to <i> fool us.</i>
Ladies and gentlemen, just for

penn and teller.

36:04.329 --> 36:07.297
Penn and teller.
[Cheers and applause]

36:14.906 --> 36:17.841
>> I don't know if the--in the--
people in the studio here

36:17.843 --> 36:19.543
people in the studio here
can tell that much, but people

36:19.545 --> 36:21.611
can tell that much, but people
at home can certainly tell that

36:21.613 --> 36:23.313
at home can certainly tell that
because we're live performers,

36:23.315 --> 36:25.448
because we're live performers,
you might notice that I tend to

36:25.450 --> 36:27.384
you might notice that I tend to
look toward the back when I'm

36:27.386 --> 36:28.485
look toward the back when I'm
performing and when I'm talking

36:28.487 --> 36:29.953
performing and when I'm talking
to all of you, and that's 'cause

36:29.955 --> 36:32.389
to all of you, and that's 'cause
I have astonishingly bad

36:32.391 --> 36:33.356
I have astonishingly bad
eyesight.

36:33.358 --> 36:34.457
Eyesight.
See, if I'm sitting

36:34.459 --> 36:35.492
see, if I'm sitting
right up here in the front,

36:35.494 --> 36:36.359
right up here in the front,
like right down here,

36:36.361 --> 36:37.561
like right down here,
still looks like I'm watching

36:37.563 --> 36:40.363
still looks like I'm watching
on TV, so I always experience

36:40.365 --> 36:41.665
on TV, so I always experience
every show--no matter where I'm

36:41.667 --> 36:43.466
every show--no matter where I'm
sitting, I always experience it

36:43.468 --> 36:45.602
sitting, I always experience it
kind of vicariously.

36:45.604 --> 36:46.536
Kind of vicariously.
What's your name, please, ma'am?

36:46.538 --> 36:47.404
What's your name, please, ma'am?
>> Becks.

36:47.406 --> 36:47.871

36:47.873 --> 36:48.538
>> Becks.
Right up here,

36:48.540 --> 36:49.439

would you please, becks?

36:49.441 --> 36:50.040
Would you please, becks?
Right up here on the stage,

36:50.041 --> 36:50.640
right up here on the stage,

36:50.642 --> 36:51.608
Please.
I'm bringing you up here

36:51.610 --> 36:53.610
I'm bringing you up here
for a couple of reasons here,

36:53.612 --> 36:55.445
for a couple of reasons here,
becks.

36:58.316 --> 37:03.353
One reason is, a lot of times,
people sitting in the back don't

37:03.355 --> 37:04.287
people sitting in the back don't
think they're ever going to even

37:04.289 --> 37:05.555
think they're ever going to even
see someone who's sitting

37:05.557 --> 37:06.656
see someone who's sitting
right down here in front.

37:06.658 --> 37:07.524
Right down here in front.
This is becks.

37:07.526 --> 37:08.658
This is becks.
She's in the third row.

37:08.660 --> 37:09.643
She's in the third row.
That's what people in front

37:09.644 --> 37:10.627
that's what people in front
look like right here.

37:10.629 --> 37:12.462
Look like right here.
That's becks right there.

37:12.464 --> 37:14.631
That's becks right there.
And I also wanted to give you

37:14.633 --> 37:15.999
and I also wanted to give you
an opportunity to meet teller.

37:16.001 --> 37:17.534
An opportunity to meet teller.
He looks about 10 pounds

37:17.536 --> 37:19.369
he looks about 10 pounds
heavier on TV, but all the same,

37:19.371 --> 37:20.303
heavier on TV, but all the same,
that's teller.

37:20.305 --> 37:21.004
That's teller.
Gonna bring you right over here,

37:21.006 --> 37:21.671
gonna bring you right over here,
becks.

37:21.673 --> 37:23.006
Becks.
One of the things that I

37:23.008 --> 37:24.608
one of the things that I
noticed, as I got close to you,

37:24.610 --> 37:25.642
noticed, as I got close to you,
is, you're wearing glasses that

37:25.644 --> 37:27.711
is, you're wearing glasses that
are very fashionable

37:27.713 --> 37:29.746
are very fashionable
and very attractive.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.248
And very attractive.
Are those just worn for fashion,

37:31.250 --> 37:32.015
are those just worn for fashion,
or are they also corrective?

37:32.017 --> 37:32.882
Or are they also corrective?
>> No, they're for corrective.

37:32.884 --> 37:33.583
>> No, they're for corrective.
>> They're corrective.

37:33.585 --> 37:34.651
>> They're corrective.
Just--forgive me for a second.

37:34.653 --> 37:35.218
Just--forgive me for a second.
Would you just take them

37:35.219 --> 37:35.784
would you just take them
off for a sec?

37:35.787 --> 37:36.653
Off for a sec?
I just want to take

37:36.655 --> 37:37.320
I just want to take
a look at them.

37:37.322 --> 37:37.988
A look at them.
Oh, these are beaut--I love

37:37.990 --> 37:39.456
oh, these are beaut--I love
the--I love the black and white.

37:39.458 --> 37:41.458
The--I love the black and white.
And so clean, becks.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.493
And so clean, becks.
Your ocular hygiene

37:43.495 --> 37:44.628
your ocular hygiene
is astonishing.

37:44.630 --> 37:45.662
Is astonishing.
That's--that's--I got to talk

37:45.664 --> 37:46.663
that's--that's--I got to talk
to you about that.

37:46.665 --> 37:48.698
To you about that.
'Cause my glasses, I look like

37:48.700 --> 37:49.699
'cause my glasses, I look like
I just cleaned them off

37:49.701 --> 37:50.734
I just cleaned them off
with a beef Patty.

37:50.736 --> 37:52.302
With a beef Patty.
But these are--

37:52.304 --> 37:53.436
but these are--
these are beautiful.

37:53.438 --> 37:54.738
These are beautiful.
And I--I don't want to get

37:54.740 --> 37:55.739
and I--I don't want to get
personal, becks, but are you

37:55.741 --> 37:56.740
personal, becks, but are you
nearsighted or farsighted?

37:56.742 --> 37:57.641
Nearsighted or farsighted?
>> Farsighted.

37:57.643 --> 37:58.541
>> Farsighted.
>> Farsighted.

37:58.543 --> 37:59.743
>> Farsighted.
So if I'm close up to you

37:59.745 --> 38:00.543
so if I'm close up to you
like--you can see me without

38:00.545 --> 38:01.011
like--you can see me without
them a little bit?

38:01.013 --> 38:01.678
Them a little bit?
>> Yeah.

38:01.680 --> 38:02.946
>> Yeah.
>> Okay, let me just put these

38:02.948 --> 38:04.481
>> okay, let me just put these
right here, becks,

38:04.483 --> 38:05.782
right here, becks,
where they'll be safe.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.851
Where they'll be safe.
Now, uh, becks, with you on

38:07.853 --> 38:09.486
now, uh, becks, with you on
stage, you can feel the whole

38:09.488 --> 38:11.421
stage, you can feel the whole
tone of the audience changes

38:11.423 --> 38:13.490
tone of the audience changes
'cause the audience trusts you

38:13.492 --> 38:14.958
'cause the audience trusts you
in a way they couldn't possibly

38:14.960 --> 38:16.059
in a way they couldn't possibly
trust me, okay?

38:16.061 --> 38:17.427
Trust me, okay?
For instance, if you were not

38:17.429 --> 38:18.962
for instance, if you were not
on stage and I were to reach

38:18.964 --> 38:20.430
on stage and I were to reach
into my pocket and pull out

38:20.432 --> 38:23.600
into my pocket and pull out
a billiard bill and just state

38:23.602 --> 38:26.002
a billiard bill and just state
this is a billiard ball,

38:26.004 --> 38:27.637
this is a billiard ball,
some people wouldn't believe me.

38:27.639 --> 38:28.271
Some people wouldn't believe me.
They wouldn't believe

38:28.272 --> 38:28.904
they wouldn't believe
for a few reasons.

38:28.907 --> 38:30.340
For a few reasons.
One reason is, they sell

38:30.342 --> 38:32.709
one reason is, they sell
billiard ball shells that are

38:32.711 --> 38:33.543
billiard ball shells that are
used for billiard ball

38:33.545 --> 38:35.445
used for billiard ball
manipulation acts.

38:35.447 --> 38:36.479
Manipulation acts.
They sell collapsible

38:36.481 --> 38:37.480
they sell collapsible
billiard balls.

38:37.482 --> 38:38.448
Billiard balls.
And also they wouldn't believe

38:38.450 --> 38:41.651
and also they wouldn't believe
me because, becks, I am a liar.

38:41.653 --> 38:42.686
Me because, becks, I am a liar.
So if you weren't up here

38:42.688 --> 38:44.054
so if you weren't up here
to demonstrate that it's a real

38:44.056 --> 38:45.722
to demonstrate that it's a real
billiard ball, I might do that

38:45.724 --> 38:46.790
billiard ball, I might do that
by going over here and just

38:46.792 --> 38:48.992
by going over here and just
tapping it like this.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.694
Tapping it like this.
Now, with you on stage, becks,

38:50.696 --> 38:51.594
now, with you on stage, becks,
I don't have to do that.

38:51.596 --> 38:52.729
I don't have to do that.
But I still do it

38:52.731 --> 38:54.397
but I still do it
because it annoys teller,

38:54.399 --> 38:56.399
because it annoys teller,
and that brings me joy.

38:56.401 --> 38:57.734
And that brings me joy.
So, with you on stage, becks,

38:57.736 --> 38:58.702
so, with you on stage, becks,
all I have to do is have you

38:58.704 --> 38:59.469
all I have to do is have you
examine--and it's really

38:59.471 --> 39:00.370
examine--and it's really
important--examine that

39:00.372 --> 39:01.638
important--examine that
billiard ball, would you please?

39:01.640 --> 39:02.772
Billiard ball, would you please?
We're also gonna use this

39:02.774 --> 39:03.640
we're also gonna use this
magic wand.

39:03.642 --> 39:04.774
Magic wand.
Teller, you're not facing--

39:04.776 --> 39:05.742
teller, you're not facing--
bring it here.

39:05.744 --> 39:06.743
Bring it here.
Now I can use that magic wand.

39:06.745 --> 39:07.327
Now I can use that magic wand.
And, becks, is that a real

39:07.328 --> 39:07.910
and, becks, is that a real
billiard ball?

39:07.913 --> 39:08.778
Billiard ball?
>> Yeah.

39:08.780 --> 39:09.779
>> Yeah.
>> And is this a real

39:09.781 --> 39:11.081
>> and is this a real
magic wand?

39:11.083 --> 39:12.349
Magic wand?
Who cares, becks?

39:12.351 --> 39:14.084
Who cares, becks?
And, um...

39:14.086 --> 39:15.518
And, um...
See, this works better to be

39:15.520 --> 39:16.519
see, this works better to be
in the audience than it is

39:16.521 --> 39:17.354
in the audience than it is
to be right up here,

39:17.356 --> 39:18.021
to be right up here,
'cause in the audience,

39:18.023 --> 39:19.756
'cause in the audience,
this looks kind of groovy.

39:19.758 --> 39:21.391
This looks kind of groovy.
But up here, this is clearly

39:21.393 --> 39:22.826
but up here, this is clearly
just a dowel covered

39:22.828 --> 39:23.927
just a dowel covered
with shelf paper

39:23.929 --> 39:24.861
with shelf paper
and some adhesive tape

39:24.863 --> 39:25.929
and some adhesive tape
that's been bitten off by one of

39:25.931 --> 39:27.797
that's been bitten off by one of
our magic guys, Zeke.

39:27.799 --> 39:28.665
Our magic guys, Zeke.
But all the same, these are

39:28.667 --> 39:29.799
but all the same, these are
the props we're gonna be using,

39:29.801 --> 39:30.700
the props we're gonna be using,
becks.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.102
Becks.
Now I'm gonna tap this

39:32.104 --> 39:33.436
now I'm gonna tap this
three times.

39:33.438 --> 39:34.637
Three times.
On the third time, it's gonna

39:34.639 --> 39:35.105
on the third time, it's gonna
vanish, okay, becks?

39:35.107 --> 39:35.772
Vanish, okay, becks?
>> Okay.

39:35.774 --> 39:36.806
>> Okay.
>> Now, am I in your sweet spot?

39:36.808 --> 39:37.507
>> Now, am I in your sweet spot?
Can you see okay?

39:37.509 --> 39:37.974
Can you see okay?

39:38.793 --> 39:39.609
>> okay, I just want to make
sure with your eyesight.

39:39.611 --> 39:40.543
Sure with your eyesight.
Here we go, becks.

39:40.545 --> 39:42.979
Here we go, becks.
In one, two, three.

39:42.981 --> 39:44.714
In one, two, three.
>> [Laughing]

39:44.716 --> 39:51.020
>> [Laughing]
[Applause]

39:51.022 --> 39:51.888
[Applause]
>> What was that, becks,

39:51.890 --> 39:53.656
>> what was that, becks,
about two seconds?

39:53.658 --> 39:54.124
About two seconds?
A second?

39:54.126 --> 39:54.791
A second?
>> Yeah, a second.

39:54.793 --> 39:56.760
>> Yeah, a second.
>> But for, like, that second,

39:56.762 --> 39:57.694
>> but for, like, that second,
you were filled with, like,

39:57.696 --> 39:59.796
you were filled with, like,
full-body Disney wonder, right?

39:59.798 --> 40:00.930
Full-body Disney wonder, right?
>> Yes.

40:00.932 --> 40:02.465
>> Yes.
>> And then you glanced up here,

40:02.467 --> 40:03.767
>> and then you glanced up here,
and the waveform collapsed

40:03.769 --> 40:04.434
and the waveform collapsed
and went to...

40:04.436 --> 40:04.901
And went to...
>> Yeah.

40:04.903 --> 40:05.935
>> Yeah.
>> Abject disappointment.

40:05.937 --> 40:06.903
>> Abject disappointment.
[Laughter]

40:06.905 --> 40:08.571
[Laughter]
But fortunately for everyone

40:08.573 --> 40:10.840
but fortunately for everyone
involved, this is a two-person

40:10.842 --> 40:13.576
involved, this is a two-person
performing ensemble, and teller

40:13.578 --> 40:15.645
performing ensemble, and teller
is much better than I am.

40:15.647 --> 40:16.546
Is much better than I am.
So you watch--the rest

40:16.547 --> 40:17.446
so you watch--the rest
of this trick, you can

40:17.449 --> 40:18.515
of this trick, you can
pretty much ignore me.

40:18.517 --> 40:19.516
Pretty much ignore me.
It doesn't matter at all.

40:19.518 --> 40:22.051
It doesn't matter at all.
But keep your eyes on teller.

40:22.053 --> 40:23.052
But keep your eyes on teller.
Stare at him carefully.

40:23.054 --> 40:24.821
Stare at him carefully.
Put your--

40:24.823 --> 40:26.790
put your--
oh, no, becks.

40:26.792 --> 40:28.958
Oh, no, becks.
One of two things has happened.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.027
One of two things has happened.
Either your glasses have really,

40:31.029 --> 40:33.897
either your glasses have really,
truly vanished, or I no longer

40:33.899 --> 40:35.432
truly vanished, or I no longer
care about breaking them.

40:35.434 --> 40:35.899
Care about breaking them.
[Laughter]

40:35.901 --> 40:36.766
[Laughter]
First you said it was a--

40:36.768 --> 40:37.784
first you said it was a--
so you said it was about

40:37.785 --> 40:38.801
so you said it was about
a second I fooled you?

40:38.804 --> 40:39.469
A second I fooled you?
Is that right?

40:39.471 --> 40:40.137
Is that right?
About a second, you said

40:40.138 --> 40:40.804
about a second, you said
I fooled you?

40:40.806 --> 40:41.771
I fooled you?
Is that what you said?

40:41.773 --> 40:42.806
Is that what you said?
About a second I fooled you.

40:42.808 --> 40:43.907
About a second I fooled you.
This might fool you

40:43.909 --> 40:47.710
this might fool you
a little longer, becks.

40:47.712 --> 40:48.945
A little longer, becks.
Now, becks,

40:48.947 --> 40:50.146
now, becks,
I don't expect you to be able

40:50.148 --> 40:51.581
I don't expect you to be able
to see that far without

40:51.583 --> 40:54.517
to see that far without
your glasses, but, becks,

40:54.519 --> 40:55.652
your glasses, but, becks,
are those your glasses

40:55.654 --> 40:56.119
are those your glasses
over there, becks?

40:56.121 --> 40:56.786
Over there, becks?
>> Yeah.

40:56.788 --> 40:57.821
>> Yeah.
>> Go over there and pluck them

40:57.823 --> 40:59.656
>> go over there and pluck them
off teller's face

40:59.658 --> 41:01.758
off teller's face
and put them on your own face.

41:01.760 --> 41:02.959
And put them on your own face.
Are those your glasses, becks?

41:02.961 --> 41:03.827
Are those your glasses, becks?
>> Yeah.

41:03.829 --> 41:04.894
>> Yeah.
>> I'm really sorry.

41:04.896 --> 41:05.795
>> I'm really sorry.
But you can clean them off

41:05.797 --> 41:06.696
but you can clean them off
just a little bit.

41:06.698 --> 41:07.163
Just a little bit.
Thank you so much.

41:07.165 --> 41:07.931
