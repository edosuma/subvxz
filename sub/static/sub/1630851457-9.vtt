01:07.291 --> 01:08.666
No, not again.

01:30.666 --> 01:34.833
Stop! Don't attack
the people trying to help you.

01:34.916 --> 01:38.000
Ah. You're finally awake, Tsubaki.

01:38.083 --> 01:39.916
-Misa?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.500
You know each other?

01:42.166 --> 01:45.666
When I heard about what happened
to your father, I just had to come.

01:48.041 --> 01:52.291
Who would have thought there'd be
a Sith hidden among the royal family?

01:53.375 --> 01:55.666
-Why is the princess carrying a bow?

01:55.750 --> 01:57.416
Surely, you don't plan to fight?

01:58.041 --> 02:00.375
Tsubaki, why did you come?

02:00.458 --> 02:04.458
Masago is a Sith Lord.
It's impossible to defeat her alone.

02:06.125 --> 02:07.500
Allow me to go with you.

02:10.583 --> 02:13.833
Hmm. I'm not sure.
Well, we'll just go this way.

02:13.916 --> 02:16.458
Lady Misa, who is your strange friend?

02:18.125 --> 02:19.416
He's a Jedi.

02:19.500 --> 02:22.708
He helped us five years ago
when we were attacked by Orochi.

02:22.791 --> 02:26.791
Eh? A Jedi traveled all the way here
by himself?

02:26.875 --> 02:28.166
Seems kind of suspicious.

02:29.416 --> 02:31.458
Misa, do they really need to be here?

02:31.541 --> 02:33.208
'Scuse me?

02:33.291 --> 02:35.750
From what I can tell,
you can't seem to fight.

02:35.833 --> 02:39.166
I see. Jedi judge by appearances, do they?

02:39.250 --> 02:41.500
If you must know,
we're not strong fighters.

02:44.041 --> 02:47.208
We can't even fend off
wild tooka-cats!

02:50.583 --> 02:53.125
Why do we need guides
to lead us back to your palace?

02:54.041 --> 02:56.958
Things have changed.
There are checkpoints everywhere.

02:57.041 --> 02:59.875
I am in exile and now cannot even
get close to the palace.

03:01.416 --> 03:03.625
Kamahachi knows
all the back roads in and out,

03:04.125 --> 03:06.333
and Senshuu has all the connections.

03:06.416 --> 03:09.666
-They are both essential to this journey.

03:09.750 --> 03:12.791
Well, they're searching
for you.

03:13.375 --> 03:16.250
Understood, but they better not
get in the way.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.625
Shh. Shh. Stop!
They'll hear you!

03:22.708 --> 03:25.458
You're not scared,
are you, Jedi?

03:25.541 --> 03:28.083
It's a protection song
against evil spirits.

03:30.958 --> 03:32.458
Hey, stop singing!

03:32.541 --> 03:33.833
Be quiet!

04:08.750 --> 04:12.125
We're surrounded.
There's no way out of here.

04:12.208 --> 04:14.125
-Hey. Up here.

04:14.208 --> 04:17.958
-There's a path across the mountain.
-Eh? No! We can't do that!

04:18.041 --> 04:21.000
There's a reason why they call the area
the "place of the gods,"

04:21.083 --> 04:23.500
because no one who has entered
has ever returned.

04:23.583 --> 04:25.750
We-- We can't. Impossible.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.916
We've no choice. Let's go.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.791
Stop!

04:29.875 --> 04:32.708
You'll be cursed!
No, I won't go!

04:33.291 --> 04:34.875
Fine. I'll add 300 credits.

04:35.541 --> 04:36.875
Hmm.

04:36.958 --> 04:39.333
That is-- Watch out! 500!

04:40.791 --> 04:42.291
Deal.

05:06.375 --> 05:09.250
-Huh?

05:10.583 --> 05:12.458
Kamahachi? We have to go back!

05:13.291 --> 05:16.041
No! If we do, we lose you too.

05:16.125 --> 05:17.208
Let me go!

05:17.291 --> 05:18.416
It's hopeless.

05:18.500 --> 05:19.958
It's his destiny to die.

05:20.041 --> 05:21.750
This is divine punishment.

05:21.833 --> 05:22.958
Ridiculous.

05:23.041 --> 05:25.083
Nothing is predestined!

05:25.166 --> 05:27.708
-Go on. I'll find you later.
-Tsubaki!

05:39.875 --> 05:43.500
I don't have any more money.

05:43.583 --> 05:45.333
No, Lady Misa.

05:56.958 --> 05:57.958
Huh?

05:59.958 --> 06:02.125
-Kamahachi!

06:04.000 --> 06:05.583
You made it.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.083
As promised.

06:08.500 --> 06:11.208
-Take care of yourself, my Lady.

06:11.750 --> 06:12.958
-Tsubaki?

06:15.833 --> 06:17.375
-Are you okay?

06:17.458 --> 06:19.125
-I'm fine.

06:19.208 --> 06:20.583
-Hmm?
-Eh?

07:08.208 --> 07:11.958
Your father is making a fuss
that his princess has disappeared.

07:12.041 --> 07:15.041
He's just overreacting.

07:15.125 --> 07:16.541
You should get some rest.

07:16.625 --> 07:20.208
I'd love to if I could,
but I'm still working.

07:20.291 --> 07:22.791
You call this working? Like Jedi work?

07:23.416 --> 07:25.166
Unfortunately, yes.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.958
Why are you out here, really?

07:28.750 --> 07:33.333
Just thinkingâ€¦ about bringing stability
and peace to this world

07:33.416 --> 07:35.166
and what it would take to do it.

07:45.250 --> 07:47.291
I've thought about it too.

07:47.375 --> 07:49.416
About what I can do.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.333
Also about what I can't.

07:52.250 --> 07:53.500
What was your conclusion?

07:54.333 --> 07:56.750
Well, well, Princess.

07:58.708 --> 08:00.833
Did you think that by bringing a Jedi

08:00.916 --> 08:03.291
you'd be able to avenge
your pitiful father?

08:08.958 --> 08:11.041
You are the king's sister.

08:11.125 --> 08:12.791
-How could you?

08:12.875 --> 08:17.250
It was the right time. I was waiting
for the perfect opportunity to come along.

08:17.333 --> 08:21.833
Masago, you are to leave this planet
right now and never return.

08:21.916 --> 08:24.208
Is this a taste of that Jedi benevolence?

08:37.708 --> 08:41.083
You have talent, but you lack technique.

08:54.166 --> 08:55.583
He was always going to die

08:55.666 --> 08:57.083
-because it was written.

08:58.041 --> 09:00.208
There is nothing that has not been fated.

09:03.750 --> 09:07.166
Let go!

09:08.458 --> 09:10.833
Tsubaki!

09:14.875 --> 09:16.541
Calm down, Tsubaki.

09:16.625 --> 09:17.916
Consider the facts.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.208
What could you possibly have done
to save your friends?

09:28.458 --> 09:33.208
Now you're finally able to see
the limitations of the Jedi's power.

09:34.750 --> 09:35.833
If you allow it,

09:35.916 --> 09:39.625
the dark side will awaken the true power
that lies within you.

09:42.625 --> 09:46.000
You will join me.
It is written. It is your destiny.

09:52.250 --> 09:53.583
I have to go back.

09:54.083 --> 09:56.375
You've been having a nightmare recently.

09:56.458 --> 09:57.875
What did you see?

09:57.958 --> 09:58.958
I'm not sure.

09:59.666 --> 10:02.958
The vision of someone
being killed repeatedly.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.125
Someone else should go in your stead.

10:06.208 --> 10:09.541
If you go, you will be tempted,
and it will cloud your judgment.

10:11.083 --> 10:15.250
If it comes to that,
understand I won't be able to save you.

10:15.333 --> 10:16.333
It's destiny.

10:16.916 --> 10:19.666
No, it's not!

10:47.458 --> 10:49.916
Without power,
you can change nothing.

10:50.750 --> 10:54.250
You can gain it though
by becoming my right hand.

10:56.083 --> 10:59.416
With you by my side,
we will be able to rule together,

10:59.500 --> 11:02.291
and we will bring order to the galaxy.

11:02.375 --> 11:04.291
We can then protect the planet.

11:04.375 --> 11:07.458
We can protect your precious Misa as well.

11:09.875 --> 11:10.916
She's dead!

11:11.625 --> 11:13.583
-Are you sure?

11:13.666 --> 11:17.000
Why don't we try to save Misa together?

11:28.500 --> 11:33.583
Please, help me save her,
my Master.

11:53.250 --> 11:54.833
What did you do, Tsubaki?

11:55.333 --> 11:57.333
I did what had to be done.

11:58.375 --> 12:01.166
Shall we go, my apprentice?
