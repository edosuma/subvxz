- Knew it!

06:20.423 --> 06:21.623
I used to wear them in school.

they're just kind of a... comfort thing.

kind of a fashion statement.

41:11.943 --> 41:13.703
Even her folks
don't come visit no more so...

41:13.783 --> 41:15.063
She's passing over?

41:17.543 --> 41:20.023
- When?
- Uh...

41:20.103 --> 41:22.463
- Let's go grab a coffee.
- Okay.

41:24.343 --> 41:27.143
- She didn't tell you?
- No, she did not.

41:28.023 --> 41:32.743
- Said she was just visiting.
- More like sampling the trial version.

41:34.903 --> 41:40.463
I mean, I've only known her
the past three years.

41:40.543 --> 41:43.503
We talk on the comm box.

41:46.143 --> 41:49.223
She told you how she ended up
quadriplegic?

41:49.303 --> 41:51.143
And how long she's been that way?

41:52.903 --> 41:57.263
One night, she's 21,
comes out to her folks.

41:57.343 --> 42:00.023
They're a little uptight about it,
you might say.

42:01.103 --> 42:02.863
They told her they don't
want a gay daughter.

42:02.943 --> 42:05.023
It's not natural and so forth.

42:05.103 --> 42:09.143
They fight. She gets in her car.
Runs it off the road. Boom!

42:09.223 --> 42:12.343
- When she was 21?
- More than 40 years back.

42:12.423 --> 42:15.463
It's been her whole lifetime, basically.

42:15.543 --> 42:18.063
So the whole San Junipero system
has been a big deal for her.

42:18.143 --> 42:19.663
The biggest deal.

42:19.743 --> 42:24.663
Of course now, until she passes over,
it goes permanent,

42:24.743 --> 42:27.143
she's on a five-hour weekly limit.

42:27.223 --> 42:29.103
I guess you're the same.

42:29.183 --> 42:32.663
They ration it out.
They don't trust us with more.

42:32.743 --> 42:35.743
They say you go crazy
if you have too much, you know?

42:35.823 --> 42:38.703
You don't leave your seat.
You disassociate body from mind.

42:38.783 --> 42:42.823
Like that doesn't happen
in every senior home already. [laughs]

42:43.703 --> 42:46.143
The system's there
for therapeutic reasons,

42:46.223 --> 42:49.183
immersive nostalgia therapy.

42:49.263 --> 42:51.783
Plunge you into a world of memories.

42:52.543 --> 42:55.863
Helps with Alzheimer's,
that's what they say.

42:55.943 --> 42:57.183
Small mercies.

42:58.703 --> 42:59.823
So...

43:01.103 --> 43:02.863
About this marriage...

43:05.103 --> 43:08.183
The state's got a triple lockdown
on euthanasia cases.

43:08.263 --> 43:12.383
You gotta have a sign-off from the doc,
the patient, a family member.

43:12.463 --> 43:16.863
It's to stop folks from passing over just
because they prefer San Junipero flat out.

43:16.943 --> 43:18.783
Anyhow, Yorkie's family,

43:19.423 --> 43:22.063
they're big-time religious,
and they will not sign.

43:22.143 --> 43:24.383
But a spouse can override them.

43:25.423 --> 43:28.583
- Hence the wedding bells.
- You got it.

43:28.663 --> 43:30.703
We got a pastor coming tomorrow a.m.,

43:30.783 --> 43:33.623
and then she's scheduled to pass
tomorrow afternoon.

43:33.703 --> 43:37.063
"Scheduled to pass."
Let's just call it dying.

43:37.143 --> 43:39.143
If you can call it dying.

43:39.223 --> 43:42.343
Uploaded to the cloud, sounds like heaven.

43:43.303 --> 43:44.503
I guess.

43:46.263 --> 43:47.663
You gonna wear a suit?

43:47.743 --> 43:49.463
[laughs]

43:49.543 --> 43:51.943
The ceremony's on my coffee break.

43:53.423 --> 43:56.823
I never married so I just figured,
you know, what's the harm?

43:57.823 --> 43:59.223
You're a good man.

44:01.263 --> 44:02.703
It's the least I could do, right?

44:06.423 --> 44:09.543
Think you could hook us up
to the system now?

44:09.623 --> 44:12.663
Just for a little while,
before she passes?

44:12.743 --> 44:16.343
You can still see her afterwards.
I mean, then she's no limit.

44:16.423 --> 44:19.263
She's full, fat, permanent San Juniperan.

44:19.343 --> 44:21.503
I know, but can you?

44:21.583 --> 44:24.183
Seriously, it is so tight here
that they monitor every...

44:24.263 --> 44:26.223
I only want a moment.

44:44.423 --> 44:45.223
[Greg] Ma'am.

44:46.663 --> 44:49.303
- You got five minutes
- Thank you.

45:02.943 --> 45:04.143
Hey!

45:06.383 --> 45:08.503
I've never been here
during the daylight.

45:09.703 --> 45:10.503
It's warm.

45:11.423 --> 45:14.223
Listen, I gotta be quick.
So I spoke to Greg.

45:14.303 --> 45:15.423
Oh.

45:16.903 --> 45:20.583
- You're passing over tomorrow?
- Yeah.

45:20.663 --> 45:22.383
Couple of hours after the wedding.

45:23.143 --> 45:27.543
So I guess I am technically
honeymooning here forever.

45:29.423 --> 45:31.263
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
- [shushes]

45:34.143 --> 45:37.383
- I'm gonna say something crazy.
- Okay.

45:41.783 --> 45:43.183
Wanna marry me instead?

45:45.103 --> 45:48.143
It's just... Greg seems great, but...

45:49.583 --> 45:51.783
- Why not someone you've connected with?
- [laughs]

46:00.863 --> 46:02.623
- [laughs] Is that a yes?
- [laughs]

46:05.343 --> 46:07.143
[man] ...to be your lawfully wedded wife,

46:07.223 --> 46:12.383
to have and to hold,
in sickness and in health,

46:13.623 --> 46:18.263
in good times and in woe,
for richer, for poorer...

46:19.343 --> 46:20.503
[beeping]

46:26.383 --> 46:29.143
[Yorkie breathing faintly]

46:46.383 --> 46:47.943
[breathing stops]

47:06.023 --> 47:07.863
[sighs]

47:09.583 --> 47:12.583
[gulls squawking]

47:12.663 --> 47:15.023
[waves rippling]

47:48.263 --> 47:49.343
[sighs]

47:51.423 --> 47:52.583
[nurse] Hold tight.

47:54.863 --> 47:56.223
There you go.

48:00.543 --> 48:01.543
Nearly there.

48:03.703 --> 48:04.783
That's it.

48:08.303 --> 48:10.263
[Kelly coughing]

48:15.183 --> 48:16.783
Are you sure you're all right?

48:20.863 --> 48:22.183
[beeps]

48:25.343 --> 48:27.023
[sighs]

48:44.223 --> 48:47.303
[horn honks]

48:47.743 --> 48:48.863
Hey!

48:48.943 --> 48:50.863
[both laughing]

48:58.023 --> 48:59.583
You didn't dress up to see me?

49:00.103 --> 49:01.343
Oh...

49:01.423 --> 49:02.863
Come on!

49:04.983 --> 49:07.103
- Better?
- [both laugh]

49:09.223 --> 49:10.223
Whoop!

49:13.383 --> 49:14.623
Oh!

49:16.383 --> 49:17.783
Oh! Whoo!

49:26.623 --> 49:28.503
[Yorkie] Looks so real.

49:31.223 --> 49:33.543
It feels so real!

49:36.023 --> 49:38.063
[Kelly laughs]

49:38.983 --> 49:40.383
[laughs and screams]

49:40.463 --> 49:45.303
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I love it here! [laughs]

49:45.383 --> 49:46.383
I just love it.

49:46.463 --> 49:50.143
- You've been here before.
- But now I live here!

49:51.703 --> 49:52.943
Be with me.

49:54.383 --> 49:57.903
- I'm with you now.
- That's not what I mean.

49:59.823 --> 50:01.183
Pass over.

50:02.343 --> 50:05.463
- When it's your time.
- Yorkie.

50:05.543 --> 50:08.903
- Stay here with me.
- Can we just enjoy tonight?

50:08.983 --> 50:10.983
It's almost midnight.

50:11.063 --> 50:12.423
In ten minutes, you're out of here.

50:12.503 --> 50:14.143
Then I gotta wait a week
to see you again.

50:14.223 --> 50:17.343
- You know I'm just a visitor.
- What, a couple of months, then what?

50:17.423 --> 50:20.143
- We're not discussing this.
- Then you're gone.

50:20.223 --> 50:24.063
- Just gone. You could have forever.
- Forever?

50:24.143 --> 50:27.383
- Who can even make sense of forever?
- However long you want then.

50:27.463 --> 50:30.063
I mean, you can remove yourself
like that. [snaps fingers]

50:30.143 --> 50:31.943
It's not a trap.

50:32.023 --> 50:35.423
I mean, look at it! Jesus! Touch it!
[bangs vehicle]

50:35.503 --> 50:37.823
- I'm going.
- Hey! Oh. Hey.

50:39.703 --> 50:40.703
It's real.

50:41.863 --> 50:44.263
This is real.

50:45.863 --> 50:47.503
And this.

50:49.023 --> 50:50.543
- Hmm?
- Come on.

50:50.623 --> 50:52.463
You know that was just a gesture.

50:54.423 --> 50:58.143
- You married me.
- To help you pass over.

50:58.223 --> 51:03.103
- As a... kindness.
- It's not so kind to leave.

51:07.103 --> 51:10.143
Okay, look, look, I'm sorry, I just...

51:12.143 --> 51:13.943
I got this chance.

51:15.703 --> 51:18.823
<i>We</i> got this chance.
I wanna share it with you.

51:21.223 --> 51:23.863
I said I made my choice.

51:23.943 --> 51:27.063
What is it? You feel bad
because your husband isn't here?

51:27.863 --> 51:30.743
- Because that was his choice.
- Don't.

51:30.823 --> 51:33.503
He chose not to stay here.
It's like he left you.

51:34.463 --> 51:37.543
You know, he could have stayed,
but he chose to leave you.

51:37.623 --> 51:39.903
- You don't know what you're saying.
- You should be mad at him.

51:39.983 --> 51:42.023
- Not whipping yourself with guilt.
- Get off me.

51:42.103 --> 51:45.983
You can't see it!
But what he did, it was selfish actually!

51:46.063 --> 51:47.063
[gasps]

51:50.663 --> 51:52.103
Forty-nine years...

51:54.263 --> 51:59.543
I was with him for 49 years.

52:00.583 --> 52:03.143
You can't begin to imagine.

52:04.303 --> 52:05.863
You can't know...

52:07.703 --> 52:11.263
the bond, the commitment, the boredom,

52:11.343 --> 52:13.703
the yearning, the laughter,
the love of it.

52:13.783 --> 52:16.343
The fucking love. You just cannot know!

52:18.343 --> 52:20.463
Everything we sacrificed.

52:21.903 --> 52:25.423
The years I gave him.
The years he gave me.

52:25.503 --> 52:26.863
Did you think to ask?

52:28.823 --> 52:31.423
Did it occur to you to ask?

52:33.983 --> 52:35.383
We had a daughter.

52:38.103 --> 52:39.343
Alison.

52:41.263 --> 52:44.143
Always difficult, always beautiful.

52:44.223 --> 52:46.943
Died at 39 years old, bless her heart.

52:47.023 --> 52:50.103
And Richard and I,
we felt that heartbreak as one.

52:51.543 --> 52:54.303
You think you're the only person
ever suffered, go fuck yourself.

52:54.383 --> 52:56.583
- Well, I didn't know...
- Didn't think to.

52:58.143 --> 53:00.663
You know, when he was dying,
Richard said to me

53:00.743 --> 53:04.383
when they offered him this,
to pass over, pass through,

53:04.463 --> 53:07.143
spend eternity in this fucking graveyard
you're so in love with,

53:07.223 --> 53:12.903
he said, "How can I?
When she missed out, how can I?"

53:14.183 --> 53:15.383
And so he went.

53:16.783 --> 53:19.783
And I wish I could believe he's
with her now,

53:19.863 --> 53:21.503
that they're together, but I don't.

53:22.463 --> 53:25.423
I believe they're nowhere.
Just like you said.

53:26.023 --> 53:30.103
Gone. No, I pitied you,
and that's the truth. I pitied you.

53:30.183 --> 53:31.583
Now you give me some sales pitch

53:31.663 --> 53:33.543
about how fucking peachy forever
could be.

53:33.623 --> 53:34.663
I'm sorry.

53:34.743 --> 53:36.943
You wanna spend forever
somewhere nothing matters?

53:37.783 --> 53:39.823
End up like Wes?

53:39.903 --> 53:43.023
All those lost fucks at the Quagmire

53:43.103 --> 53:45.183
trying anything to feel something,
go ahead.

53:46.463 --> 53:49.183
But I'm out. I'm gone.

53:52.463 --> 53:56.143
Kelly, I'm sorry. Kelly!

54:01.423 --> 54:03.143

56:14.023 --> 56:17.183
- You all right?
- Yeah, I am fine.

56:26.983 --> 56:29.103
[wheezes]

57:14.063 --> 57:17.023
- Well, okay then.
- Huh?

57:21.463 --> 57:22.463
Kelly?

57:23.543 --> 57:25.703
All things considered...

57:27.743 --> 57:29.183
I guess I'm ready.

57:31.703 --> 57:32.823
For what?

57:36.103 --> 57:38.103
For the rest of it.
