WEBVTT

00:04.963 --> 00:06.338
Man, this is weird.

00:06.589 --> 00:09.216
Ever realize Cap'n Crunch's
eyebrows are on his hat?

00:09.467 --> 00:10.551
That's what's weird?

00:10.802 --> 00:13.721
The man's been captain
of a cereal for 40 years.

00:16.265 --> 00:17.766
Whoa, yuck!

00:17.934 --> 00:18.976
What?

00:19.269 --> 00:21.895
The spoon!
You licked and you put.

00:24.357 --> 00:26.275
You licked and you put.

00:26.484 --> 00:27.568
Yeah, so?

00:28.445 --> 00:32.531
Don't you see how gross that is?
It's like you using my toothbrush!

00:33.408 --> 00:34.742
You used my toothbrush?

00:36.453 --> 00:40.247
Only because I used the red one
to unclog the drain.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.583
Mine is the red one!

00:44.044 --> 00:48.589
Oh, God!
Can open. Worms everywhere!

00:49.507 --> 00:51.925
Why can't we use the same toothbrush...

00:52.135 --> 00:54.094
...but we can use the same soap?

00:54.345 --> 00:58.140
Because soap is soap.
It's self-cleaning.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.726
The next time you shower...

01:00.977 --> 01:04.855
...think about the last thing I wash
and the first thing you wash.

01:54.614 --> 01:56.406
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:56.825 --> 01:59.535
Look at you fancy lads!

02:00.161 --> 02:01.203
What's the occasion?

02:01.454 --> 02:04.123
You know that guy on my show
that's in a coma?

02:05.333 --> 02:07.042
He's having a brunch.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.752
Ready when you are.

02:11.005 --> 02:13.549
I can't believe you're
actually getting tattoos.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.843
You guys are getting tattoos?

02:16.052 --> 02:19.388
But you cannot tell Ross
because I wanna surprise him.

02:19.639 --> 02:22.432
Wow, this is wild!
What are you gonna get?

02:22.684 --> 02:24.977
I'm getting a lily.

02:25.895 --> 02:28.522
For my mom, because her name's Lily.

02:29.649 --> 02:32.901
That's lucky. What if
her name was Big Ugly Splotch?

02:34.946 --> 02:36.780
- Where you getting it?
- On my shoulder.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.031
What?

02:38.366 --> 02:40.200
What's on your shoulder?

02:40.535 --> 02:41.660
A chip.

02:44.414 --> 02:47.291
- A tattoo. I'm getting a tattoo.
- A tattoo?

02:47.542 --> 02:49.376
Why? Why would you wanna do that?

02:49.627 --> 02:51.170
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.547
You don't think
they're kind of cool?

02:53.798 --> 02:55.674
No. Sorry, I don't.

02:55.884 --> 02:59.178
Why would anyone pay someone
to scar their body for life?

02:59.429 --> 03:01.513
What if it doesn't come out right?

03:01.723 --> 03:04.808
It's like having
a bad haircut all the time.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.770
Why is everyone staring at me?

03:09.230 --> 03:11.732
Sign this card for Dad.
Richard will be here soon.

03:11.941 --> 03:13.775
Richard's going to the party too?

03:14.027 --> 03:16.361
He's my parents' best friend.
He has to go.

03:16.613 --> 03:19.865
So is today the day
you'll tell them about you two?

03:20.116 --> 03:24.203
Yeah, for my dad's birthday,
I decided to give him a stroke.

03:25.079 --> 03:27.331
No, I think you should tell them.

03:27.624 --> 03:31.001
I don't know how serious he is.
Until I do, I won't say anything.

03:31.252 --> 03:33.587
I don't think
Mom and Dad would mind.

03:33.796 --> 03:36.798
Remember when you were 9
and Richard was 30, Dad said:

03:37.008 --> 03:38.842
"God, I hope they get together."

03:44.057 --> 03:45.140
Shall we?

03:45.391 --> 03:46.934
Okay, wait.

03:47.435 --> 03:48.810
You know what?

03:49.103 --> 03:52.147
Ross, let's switch places.
You get in the middle.

03:52.523 --> 03:55.817
This looks like we're trying
to cover something up.

03:56.027 --> 03:59.655
You could come in straddling him,
they still wouldn't believe it.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.408
We're here!

04:03.743 --> 04:06.370
- Hi, kids!
- The children!

04:06.829 --> 04:09.456
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Thank you.

04:09.874 --> 04:10.916
Happy birthday!

04:11.167 --> 04:13.627
So you kids thanked
Dr. Burke for the ride?

04:13.878 --> 04:17.798
Actually, Mom, I think Monica
thanked him for the both of us.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.551
So you kids take the train in?

04:21.761 --> 04:24.263
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.

04:24.472 --> 04:25.764
Speaking of whom...

04:26.015 --> 04:29.893
...I hear he's got some
20-year-old twinkie in the city.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.774
Finger cramp! Oh, God!

04:36.025 --> 04:38.360
Sorry. Here, let me get that, Mom.

04:40.363 --> 04:43.448
So Richard's shopping
in the junior section?

04:44.325 --> 04:45.784
Are we still on that?

04:46.035 --> 04:49.496
You just know she's got
the IQ of a napkin.

04:50.164 --> 04:51.581
She's probably not even pretty.

04:51.833 --> 04:55.544
Just young enough so that
everything is still pointing up.

05:03.636 --> 05:04.970
Can you believe this place?

05:05.221 --> 05:07.055
I know. This is a great apartment.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.183
In the bathroom there's mirrors
on both sides of you.

05:10.435 --> 05:13.770
When you're in there, it's like
peeing with the Rockettes.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.606
Well, there's my fantasy come true.

05:17.191 --> 05:18.233
Seriously.

05:19.402 --> 05:20.485
Hey.

05:20.653 --> 05:22.654
We were just saying, great apartment!

05:22.905 --> 05:24.823
Thanks. You want it?

05:25.074 --> 05:26.533
I'm moving to a bigger place.

05:26.784 --> 05:28.493
You should take this one.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.912
Can you see me in a place like this?

05:31.497 --> 05:34.583
Why not? You hate park views
and high ceilings?

05:34.834 --> 05:36.835
Come on, I'll show you the kitchen.

05:38.546 --> 05:41.048
That's all right,
I saw a kitchen this morning.

05:41.215 --> 05:42.299
On TV.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.968
Stop talking. Okay!

05:46.179 --> 05:48.722
- Come on, tell us!
- Is she really 20?

05:48.931 --> 05:50.807
I am not telling you guys anything.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.852
Come on, it's my birthday.
Let me live vicariously!

05:54.604 --> 05:56.730
Dad, you really don't want to do that.

05:56.939 --> 05:59.608
What's a little midlife crisis
between friends?

05:59.859 --> 06:01.318
Would you let it go?

06:01.569 --> 06:04.988
I know what you're going through.
When I turned 50, I got the Porsche.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.491
You got your own little speedster.

06:08.284 --> 06:11.161
- Seriously, it's not like that.
- Tell you what.

06:11.412 --> 06:15.374
Maybe one of these weekends
you can borrow the car and I could...

06:15.625 --> 06:18.001
Dad, I beg you not
to finish that sentence!

06:18.378 --> 06:20.045
What? I'm kidding!

06:20.338 --> 06:23.131
You know I'd never let him
touch the Porsche.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.099
Okay, Rach.

06:33.017 --> 06:35.477
Which lily?
This lily or that lily?

06:36.104 --> 06:38.397
- Well, I...
- I like this lily.

06:38.648 --> 06:41.066
It's more open
and that's like my mom.

06:41.317 --> 06:43.777
She had a more open, giving spirit.

06:44.278 --> 06:46.279
Foghorn Leghorn!

06:48.032 --> 06:50.242
Blond girl?
You're in room two.

06:50.451 --> 06:52.953
Not-so-blond girl, you're with me.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.247
- Here we go!
- Uh-huh.

06:56.290 --> 06:57.749
You're not going.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.000
Uh-huh.

06:59.168 --> 07:01.211
Is this because of what Ross said?

07:01.587 --> 07:02.671
No.

07:04.048 --> 07:06.591
- Well, yeah, maybe.
- I don't believe this.

07:06.843 --> 07:10.679
Is this how this relationship works?
Ross equals boss?

07:11.848 --> 07:14.057
Come on, what is this, 1922?

07:14.600 --> 07:16.017
What's 1922?

07:16.811 --> 07:18.770
Just, you know, a long time ago.

07:20.606 --> 07:23.817
When men used to tell women
what to do a lot.

07:24.152 --> 07:27.696
Then there was suffrage, which was
a good thing. But it sounds horrible.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.534
Do you want this tattoo?

07:32.785 --> 07:34.786
Yes, I do.
It's just that Ross...

07:35.872 --> 07:37.789
Is your boyfriend the boss of you?

07:39.709 --> 07:40.750
No.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.586
Who is the boss of you?

07:44.130 --> 07:45.297
You?

07:46.048 --> 07:48.884
No. You are the boss of you!

07:49.135 --> 07:52.053
You march in there and
get that tattoo on your hip!

07:52.680 --> 07:54.055
Go!

08:00.188 --> 08:01.396
How you doing?

08:01.606 --> 08:03.231
I'm a twinkie!

08:04.317 --> 08:06.568
Really? I'm a hero.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.989
This is so hard.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.284
Yeah, I know. I hate it too.

08:14.577 --> 08:17.245
Look, maybe we should just tell them.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.123
Maybe we should just tell
your parents first.

08:20.708 --> 08:22.417
My parents are dead.

08:23.461 --> 08:25.754
God, you are so lucky!

08:27.507 --> 08:29.508
I mean...
Well, you know what I mean.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.427
Just hang in there, okay?

08:33.136 --> 08:35.764
Okay, I'll go out first, all right?

08:41.229 --> 08:44.481
Judy! Going to the bathroom.
Good for you!

08:47.693 --> 08:51.404
Thank you, Richard.
I appreciate the support.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.618
Honey.

08:57.411 --> 09:00.413
Seen my Harmon Killebrew bat?
Bob doesn't believe I have one.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.123
I have no idea.

09:02.750 --> 09:05.126
Did you know Richard
has a twinkie in the city?

09:07.046 --> 09:10.382
I know. He's a new man.
It's like a scene from Cocoon.

09:11.300 --> 09:14.511
I just never would have
pictured Richard with a bimbo.

09:14.762 --> 09:17.639
He told Johnny Shapiro
that she's quite a girl.

09:17.848 --> 09:21.434
He told Johnny that he thinks
he's falling in love with her.

09:21.644 --> 09:24.145
- Really?
- I've never seen him this happy.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.814
So, Jack...

09:26.274 --> 09:28.900
...ever think about trading me in
for a younger model?

09:29.151 --> 09:31.278
Of course not.

09:31.487 --> 09:34.030
With you, it's like
I've got two 25-year-olds.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.245
Oh, Jack, stop!

09:40.454 --> 09:42.289
Come on!

09:42.999 --> 09:45.417
It's my birthday!

09:49.672 --> 09:50.839
Can we drop this?

09:51.090 --> 09:53.300
I am not interested
in the guy's apartment.

09:53.593 --> 09:57.721
Oh, please. I saw the way
you were checking out his moldings.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.014
You want it.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.266
Why would I want another apartment?

10:01.517 --> 10:03.685
I've already got
an apartment that I love.

10:03.936 --> 10:06.062
It wouldn't kill you
to say it once in a while.

10:09.817 --> 10:13.778
All right. You want the truth?
I'm thinking about it.

10:14.905 --> 10:16.489
- What?
- I'm sorry.

10:16.741 --> 10:19.618
I'm 28. I've never lived alone...

10:19.827 --> 10:22.787
...and I'm at a place
where I got enough money...

10:22.997 --> 10:24.539
...that I don't need a roommate.

10:24.749 --> 10:28.001
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't need a roommate either.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.754
I can afford to live here by myself.

10:31.005 --> 10:34.633
I may have to bring in somebody
once a week to lick the silverware.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.969
Why are you getting
so bent out of shape?

10:38.179 --> 10:40.472
We didn't agree to live
together forever.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.349
We're not Bert and Ernie.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.560
You know what?

10:45.770 --> 10:47.562
If this is the way you feel...

10:47.813 --> 10:49.648
...then maybe you should take it.

10:50.566 --> 10:52.692
- That's how I feel.
- Then maybe you should take it!

10:52.860 --> 10:53.902
Maybe I will!

10:54.070 --> 10:55.403
- Fine with me!
- Great!

10:55.655 --> 10:58.406
You can spend more quality time
with your real friends...

10:58.616 --> 11:00.283
...the spoons!

11:01.327 --> 11:03.411
Whose drink can I freshen?

11:05.081 --> 11:06.956
Almost time for cake!

11:16.175 --> 11:17.384
Mon?

11:17.718 --> 11:19.302
Mon, are you okay?

11:19.553 --> 11:23.556
- Remember that video of Mom and Dad?
- Yeah?

11:24.016 --> 11:26.351
- Well, I just caught the live show.
- Ew!

11:38.280 --> 11:40.407
- Hey there.
- What?

11:41.075 --> 11:45.036
Nothing. I just heard
something nice about you.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.122
Really?

11:47.415 --> 11:48.707
Richard?

11:50.292 --> 11:53.753
- Your son isn't seeing anyone, is he?
- Not that I know of.

11:54.004 --> 11:57.465
I was thinking, why doesn't
he give Monica a call?

12:01.137 --> 12:02.929
That's an idea.

12:03.139 --> 12:06.266
Well, actually,
I'm already seeing someone.

12:06.475 --> 12:07.726
- Oh?
- Oh?

12:08.310 --> 12:09.602
Oh...

12:11.772 --> 12:13.606
She never tells us anything.

12:13.858 --> 12:16.276
Ross, did you know
Monica's seeing someone?

12:16.527 --> 12:19.821
Mom, there are
so many people in my life.

12:20.406 --> 12:23.074
Some are seeing people
and some aren't.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.034
Is that crystal?

12:27.747 --> 12:29.581
So who's the mystery man?

12:30.249 --> 12:32.625
Well, he's a doctor.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.294
A real doctor?

12:34.545 --> 12:36.713
No, a doctor of meat.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.424
Of course he's a real doctor.

12:39.675 --> 12:41.301
And he's handsome.

12:42.219 --> 12:44.971
And he's sweet,
and I know you'd like him.

12:45.222 --> 12:47.182
Well, that's wonderful.

12:53.230 --> 12:55.273
Mom, it's okay.

12:55.441 --> 12:56.524
It is, Judy.

12:56.734 --> 12:58.193
Jack!

13:00.112 --> 13:02.781
Could you come in here for a moment?

13:03.282 --> 13:04.324
Now!

13:05.159 --> 13:07.786
- Found it!
- I'll take that, Dad.

13:11.457 --> 13:16.044
It seems your daughter and Richard
are something of an item.

13:16.504 --> 13:19.881
That's impossible.
He's got a twinkie in the city.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.383
I'm the twinkie.

13:23.010 --> 13:25.178
- You're the twinkie?
- She's not a twinkie!

13:25.679 --> 13:28.431
Look, this is the best relationship
I've been in...

13:28.641 --> 13:31.351
Oh, please! A relationship?

13:31.602 --> 13:33.019
Yes, a relationship!

13:33.229 --> 13:35.480
For your information,
I'm crazy about this man.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.815
Really?

13:37.441 --> 13:38.525
Yes.

13:38.943 --> 13:42.195
Am I supposed to stand here
and listen to this on my birthday?

13:43.531 --> 13:47.617
This is a good thing. You said
you've never seen Richard happier.

13:47.785 --> 13:48.827
When did I say that?

13:48.994 --> 13:52.622
Upstairs in the bathroom,
right before you felt up Mom!

13:53.624 --> 13:56.000
Happy birthday to you

13:56.210 --> 13:59.754
Happy birthday to you

14:00.005 --> 14:04.342
Happy birthday, dear Jack

14:04.802 --> 14:09.347
Happy birthday to you

14:10.641 --> 14:13.893
It looks so good!
Oh, I love it.

14:14.144 --> 14:17.230
I know, so do I!
I'm so glad you made me do this.

14:17.439 --> 14:19.315
Okay, let me see yours.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.737
Let's see yours again.

14:25.656 --> 14:28.283
We just saw mine.
Let me see yours.

14:31.161 --> 14:32.537
Oh, no!

14:33.706 --> 14:35.707
It's gone! That's so weird.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.710
I don't know how, where it went.

14:41.088 --> 14:42.171
You didn't get it?

14:42.339 --> 14:43.464
No.

14:44.049 --> 14:45.091
Why not?

14:45.301 --> 14:46.759
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

14:47.011 --> 14:49.554
How could you do this to me?
This was your idea!

14:49.763 --> 14:53.349
I know! I was gonna get it,
but he came in with this needle.

14:53.559 --> 14:56.227
And did you know
they do this with needles?

14:57.438 --> 14:59.147
Really? You don't say?

14:59.356 --> 15:02.275
Because mine was licked on by kittens!

15:05.362 --> 15:06.446
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:06.697 --> 15:08.156
I'm sorry about what...

15:08.407 --> 15:09.824
- Yeah, me too.
- I know.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.121
Do we need to hug?

15:17.041 --> 15:18.541
No, we're all right.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.669
So I got you something.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.297
Plastic spoons!

15:26.675 --> 15:29.594
- Great!
- Lick away, my man!

15:30.387 --> 15:33.973
These will go great in my new place
till I get real ones.

15:34.767 --> 15:35.808
What?

15:36.477 --> 15:40.647
I can't use these forever.
They're no friend of the environment.

15:41.315 --> 15:44.192
No, I mean what's this
about your new place?

15:44.652 --> 15:46.361
I'm moving out,
like we talked about.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.571
I didn't think that was serious.

15:50.866 --> 15:53.368
You know, I thought
that was just a fight.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.286
Well, it was a fight...

15:55.537 --> 15:57.789
...based on serious stuff, remember?

15:58.040 --> 16:00.166
About how I never
lived alone or anything?

16:00.417 --> 16:03.378
I think it would be good for me.
Help me to grow...

16:03.879 --> 16:04.963
...or whatever.

16:09.176 --> 16:10.885
Well, there you go.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.889
Hey, are you cool with this?

16:15.140 --> 16:16.808
I don't wanna leave you high and dry.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.851
I've never been lower or wetter.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.439
I'll be fine.
I'll just turn your...

16:23.691 --> 16:25.274
...bedroom into a game room.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.777
Put the foosball table in there.

16:29.613 --> 16:31.739
Why do you get to keep the table?

16:34.410 --> 16:36.536
I did pay for half of it.

16:39.748 --> 16:40.873
I paid for the other half.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.835
I'll tell you what.
I'll play you for it.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.129
All right, you're on.

16:46.380 --> 16:49.549
I can take two minutes
out of my day to kick your ass.

16:50.759 --> 16:54.262
Your men will get scored on
more times than your sister.

16:57.474 --> 17:00.018
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:01.812 --> 17:03.396
Which sister?

17:06.858 --> 17:09.152
So are you sorry that I told them?

17:09.361 --> 17:13.448
No. It's been a long time
since your dad and I went running.

17:17.911 --> 17:18.953
Did you get it?

17:19.163 --> 17:20.954
- Is Ross here?
- He went out for pizza.

17:21.205 --> 17:22.623
Okay, really quick.

17:24.334 --> 17:25.460
That's great!

17:25.627 --> 17:26.919
Very tasteful.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.464
- Wanna see mine? Wanna see mine?
- Yes!

17:30.007 --> 17:31.632
What? You didn't get one.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.510
Okay. Well then, what is this?

17:36.889 --> 17:38.473
What are we looking at?

17:39.349 --> 17:41.184
That blue freckle?

17:42.811 --> 17:44.103
That's my tattoo.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.898
That is not a tattoo.
That is a nothing.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.733
I got her in the chair...

17:48.984 --> 17:52.862
...he barely touched her with the
needle, she screamed and that was it.

17:53.113 --> 17:54.739
Okay, hi!

17:56.825 --> 18:00.369
For your information,
this is exactly what I wanted.

18:01.288 --> 18:04.999
This is a tattoo of the Earth as seen
from a great, great distance.

18:07.044 --> 18:09.754
It's the way my mother
sees me from heaven.

18:10.881 --> 18:13.508
Oh, what a load of crap!

18:14.968 --> 18:16.260
That is a dot!

18:16.595 --> 18:21.224
Your mother's in heaven going,
"Where the hell's my lily, you wuss!"

18:23.268 --> 18:26.312
That is not a tattoo!
This is a tattoo!

18:30.818 --> 18:32.610
You got a tattoo?

18:33.904 --> 18:34.987
Maybe.

18:36.323 --> 18:39.158
But just a little one.
Phoebe got the whole world!

18:41.286 --> 18:42.912
Well, let me see.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.625
Well?

18:47.876 --> 18:49.377
Well, it's really...

18:51.130 --> 18:52.505
...sexy.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.216
I wouldn't have thought
it would be, but...

18:56.093 --> 18:57.176
...wow!

19:00.013 --> 19:01.055
Really?

19:01.265 --> 19:02.765
Yeah, so...

19:03.559 --> 19:06.561
So is it sore?
Or can you do stuff?

19:09.231 --> 19:10.273
I guess.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.400
Save us some pizza.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.658
Get it out of the corner!

19:22.536 --> 19:23.661
Pass it! Pass it!

19:24.163 --> 19:26.080
Stop talking to your men!

19:27.457 --> 19:28.541
Yes!

19:28.792 --> 19:30.543
And the table is mine.

19:34.631 --> 19:36.299
Congratulations.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.355
You guys will still
come visit me, right?

19:51.607 --> 19:53.274
Oh, yeah! You got the big TV.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.693
We'll be over there all the time.

19:56.486 --> 19:58.571
Except when we are here.

20:03.285 --> 20:06.329
I know you're just moving uptown,
but I'll really miss you.

20:06.538 --> 20:09.665
How can you not be
across the hall anymore?

20:09.875 --> 20:14.045
Who's gonna eat all of our food
and tie up our phone lines...

20:14.296 --> 20:16.130
Is that my bra?

20:18.300 --> 20:22.136
- What are you doing with my bra?
- It's not what you think.

20:22.346 --> 20:25.473
We used it to fling
water balloons off the roof.

20:26.642 --> 20:30.102
Remember? Those kids couldn't
even get theirs across the street.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.146
Yeah, I remember.

20:34.983 --> 20:38.027
Let's bring the rest of these
down to the truck.

20:50.207 --> 20:51.791
You want me to...

20:52.292 --> 20:54.502
...give you a hand
with the foosball table?

20:54.836 --> 20:55.878
Nah...

20:56.255 --> 20:59.006
You keep it.
You need the practice.

21:01.385 --> 21:02.426
Thanks.

21:03.470 --> 21:04.512
So...

21:05.389 --> 21:06.597
...I guess this is it.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.099
Yeah, right.

21:08.350 --> 21:09.642
I guess so.

21:12.729 --> 21:14.063
Listen...

21:15.190 --> 21:16.607
When am I gonna see you?

21:16.900 --> 21:18.985
I'm guessing tonight
at the coffeehouse.

21:19.236 --> 21:21.612
Right. Yeah. Okay.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.115
Take care.
