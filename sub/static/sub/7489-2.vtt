00:06.531 --> 00:10.191
Look how small this pizza is.

00:11.302 --> 00:16.402
I just realized why they
call this place Mini's.

00:17.242 --> 00:20.577
I probably should have
ordered more than one taco.

00:20.578 --> 00:22.346
Can I have a bite of your pizza?

00:22.347 --> 00:24.207
Dez!

00:32.217 --> 00:34.491
Sorry I'm late for the
team Austin meeting.

00:34.492 --> 00:36.900
Actually you're right on time.

00:36.901 --> 00:40.464
You see, I set your watch ahead 45
minutes so you wouldn't be late.

00:40.465 --> 00:44.558
Oh man! That means I was
on time for work too!

00:44.559 --> 00:47.844
That's why they didn't fire me.

00:47.845 --> 00:50.474
Oh, so where are we on
the new dance video?

00:50.475 --> 00:53.710
Yeah, I promised the fans we'd have
it on the website by next weekend.

00:53.711 --> 00:56.580
Well, I've been working on something
with my new back-up dancers.

00:56.581 --> 00:58.415
So when do we get to see it?

00:58.416 --> 01:01.596
Does now work for you?

01:02.979 --> 01:06.399
It's an Austin flash mob!

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074

01:23.441 --> 01:25.781
Whoa! Whoa!

01:30.399 --> 01:34.835
Uh, that cart wasn't there
last night when we rehearsed.

01:34.836 --> 01:39.216
We're gonna need a
new back-up dancer.

01:41.379 --> 01:44.481
<i>When the crowd wants more,
I bring on the thunder.</i>

01:44.482 --> 01:47.616
<i>'Cause you've got my back,
and I'm not going under.</i>

01:47.617 --> 01:49.148
<i>You're my point,
you're my guard.</i>

01:49.149 --> 01:50.767
<i>You're the perfect chord.</i>

01:50.768 --> 01:53.812
<i>And I see our names together
on every billboard.</i>

01:53.813 --> 01:56.871
<i>We're headed for the top,
we've got it on lock.</i>

01:56.872 --> 01:58.485
<i>We'll make 'em say "hey!"</i>

01:58.486 --> 02:00.808
<i>And we'll keep rockin'.</i>

02:00.809 --> 02:04.946
<i>Oh, there's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

02:04.947 --> 02:07.982
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

02:07.983 --> 02:11.051
<i>It's no fun when
you're doing it solo.</i>

02:11.053 --> 02:14.375
<i>With you it's like, "whoa".
Yeah, and I know.</i>

02:14.376 --> 02:17.025
<i>I own this dream.</i>

02:17.026 --> 02:20.403
<i>'Cause I got you with me.</i>

02:20.404 --> 02:23.521
<i>There's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

02:23.522 --> 02:27.842
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

02:36.508 --> 02:38.242
Shh! Fine we'll just
keep this between us.

02:38.243 --> 02:40.578
- Okay.
- Keep what between us?

02:40.579 --> 02:42.880
Uh... Well...

02:42.881 --> 02:47.851
Uh, this book! For now we'll
just keep this book between us.

02:47.852 --> 02:50.432
What up, kids?

02:51.590 --> 02:53.757
What up, Mr. Conley?

02:53.758 --> 02:57.535
So Austin, I hear you're having
auditions for a new back-up dancer.

02:57.536 --> 03:00.356
Yeah, one of my guys got hurt last
week so we need to replace him.

03:00.357 --> 03:02.633
Oh, that's a bummer for him.

03:02.634 --> 03:04.735
But awesome for me!

03:04.736 --> 03:07.538
I'll see you cats there.

03:07.539 --> 03:09.819
You dance?

03:10.542 --> 03:12.510
But you're a teacher.

03:12.511 --> 03:15.076
There's a lot of things
about me you don't know.

03:15.077 --> 03:20.977
For instance, I live with my
mother and I text with my toes.

03:25.234 --> 03:27.117
I hope some people show up
for the audition because,

03:27.118 --> 03:30.135
my gut tells me Mister
Conley is not the guy.

03:30.136 --> 03:31.729
- No!
- Got that right.

03:31.730 --> 03:34.038
Oh hey, Trish?

03:34.039 --> 03:36.401
I thought you were going to
come by Sonic Boom last night?

03:36.402 --> 03:38.736
Oh, sorry, we went
to the movies.

03:38.737 --> 03:40.404
Don't see "The Timid Heart."

03:40.405 --> 03:42.991
We went to the movies?
Who's "we"?

03:42.992 --> 03:44.344
Uh...

03:44.345 --> 03:46.213
We? I didn't say we.

03:46.214 --> 03:48.854
I said uh, me.

03:49.421 --> 03:52.251
Really? You said "me
went to the movies"?

03:52.252 --> 03:55.930
Yes, me did! That's
what me said.

03:55.931 --> 03:59.471
Well, me gotta go to class.

04:00.564 --> 04:03.215
Trish is dating somebody!

04:03.216 --> 04:05.762
- What?
- Nobody knows Trish better than me.

04:05.763 --> 04:08.983
Something's up! She went to
the movies with somebody.

04:08.984 --> 04:11.474
Dez, do you know something?

04:11.475 --> 04:14.355
Uh uh uh uh uh...

04:14.722 --> 04:17.841
Me gotta go to class.

04:17.892 --> 04:20.772
"Uh uh uh uh uh."

04:20.985 --> 04:24.169
Five "uh" s? He does
know something.

04:24.170 --> 04:27.470
Trish is dating somebody!

04:30.285 --> 04:33.051
Welcome to the auditions to
be my new back-up dancer.

04:33.052 --> 04:34.792
Thanks for coming out.

04:34.793 --> 04:38.855
Those of you that stink, thanks
in advance for wasting my time.

04:38.856 --> 04:42.517
Just the fact that you showed
up here today means...

04:42.518 --> 04:44.040
You're a winner.

04:44.041 --> 04:48.275
Except we are only looking for
one dancer, so the truth is...

04:48.276 --> 04:51.516
Most of you are losers.

04:51.743 --> 04:55.463
Okay, let's see what you got.

05:06.131 --> 05:07.991
Woo!

05:44.829 --> 05:46.689
Woo!

05:48.172 --> 05:50.974
Wow, that Roger guy
is really good.

05:50.975 --> 05:52.670
I don't think anyone's
going to beat him.

05:52.671 --> 05:55.782
I like him! Let's hire him.

05:55.783 --> 05:58.308
Hang on, we still
have one more dancer.

05:58.309 --> 06:00.289
Trent!

06:01.609 --> 06:05.616
Here you go. Um, I just want to thank
you guys so much for this opportunity.

06:05.617 --> 06:09.820
It means so much to me, and I
would do anything to make it.

06:09.821 --> 06:11.756
He seems very driven.

06:11.757 --> 06:14.964
I like him! Let's hire him.

06:14.965 --> 06:19.285
I think we should see
him dance first.

06:38.650 --> 06:40.510
Woo!

06:40.773 --> 06:42.633
Woo!

06:43.480 --> 06:46.724
Okay, it's clearly
between Roger and Trent.

06:46.725 --> 06:47.858
Totally...

06:47.859 --> 06:50.828
And Dez and Mr. Conley
and the juggler.

06:50.829 --> 06:53.229
Everybody was so good.

06:53.230 --> 06:56.830
Uh, we can't hire everybody.

06:57.401 --> 07:01.190
Trent is the guy. He's exactly
what you're looking for.

07:01.191 --> 07:02.221
Right, Dez?

07:02.222 --> 07:05.972
I totally agree with Trish.
Trent's our guy.

07:05.973 --> 07:08.412
- Okay, I'm convinced. Trent it is.
- Yes!

07:08.413 --> 07:10.993
Ha! I'm glad that's over.

07:10.994 --> 07:13.551
I feel so bad for the people
who don't get picked.

07:13.552 --> 07:16.428
Like in "The Timid Heart," when
Emma chooses Richard over Gabe.

07:16.429 --> 07:19.004
He was devastated.

07:19.005 --> 07:21.359
Not that I would know
because I didn't see it.

07:21.360 --> 07:24.133
So what do you say I take
you guys out for some

07:24.134 --> 07:26.097
tiny pizzas to celebrate
finding a dancer?

07:26.098 --> 07:28.201
- Yeah!
- Oh, I can't.

07:28.202 --> 07:32.642
I got something to do.
And so does Dez.

07:34.048 --> 07:36.323
Dez saw "The Timid Heart."

07:36.324 --> 07:38.120
You know what that means.

07:38.121 --> 07:41.072
Trish went to the
movies with Dez.

07:41.073 --> 07:43.713
He is the "we."

07:43.714 --> 07:47.127
Trish is dating Dez!
Dez is dating Trish!

07:47.128 --> 07:48.631
Each of them is
dating the other one!

07:48.632 --> 07:49.929
Ally, come on.

07:49.930 --> 07:53.302
The idea that Dez and Trish
are secretly dating is...

07:53.303 --> 07:57.088
Ridiculous, impossible, and
completely, totally...

07:57.089 --> 07:59.009
True.

08:07.892 --> 08:10.661
I can't believe Trish
and Dez are dating.

08:10.662 --> 08:15.642
It's surprising, but I
can kind of picture it.

09:12.656 --> 09:15.658
Okay, maybe it's a
little hard to picture.

09:15.659 --> 09:19.696
I don't know why Trish didn't tell me.
We're supposed to be best friends.

09:19.697 --> 09:22.961
She probably feels weird about it.
You know...

09:22.962 --> 09:25.744
Because it's weird.

09:25.745 --> 09:30.952
What if they break up? How are we going
to work together or be friends together?

09:30.953 --> 09:34.049
I just don't want it to change
the way the four of us hang out.

09:34.050 --> 09:36.866
They'd feel the same
way if we were dating.

09:36.867 --> 09:39.267
Me and you?

09:39.459 --> 09:42.049
That'd be weird.

09:42.050 --> 09:44.510
Really weird.

09:46.557 --> 09:48.766
- Totally weird.
- Yeah, weird.

09:48.767 --> 09:52.282
Five, six, seven, eight and one.

09:52.283 --> 09:55.646
So, haven't seen you
since yesterday.

09:55.647 --> 09:57.253
Let's catch up. I'll go first...

09:57.254 --> 10:00.655
I don't have a new secret boyfriend.
Okay, your turn.

10:00.656 --> 10:03.021
Shh! I'm trying to watch
the new back-up dancer.

10:03.022 --> 10:05.811
Three and four, five,
six, seven, eight.

10:05.812 --> 10:09.886
And one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

10:09.887 --> 10:15.787
Cool! Take five. There's drinks
upstairs in the practice room.

10:16.274 --> 10:19.790
It's driving me crazy. Why won't
they admit they're dating?

10:19.791 --> 10:21.394
Maybe we got it wrong.

10:21.395 --> 10:26.488
Please, I know Trish better than anybody.
She's definitely dating Dez.

10:26.489 --> 10:28.490
Ally's acting strange.

10:28.491 --> 10:31.192
And that's unusual because...?

10:31.193 --> 10:34.018
She's acting like she
knows something.

10:34.019 --> 10:35.922
Did you tell her
about my boyfriend?

10:35.923 --> 10:38.199
I haven't said anything
about you two.

10:38.200 --> 10:41.502
You didn't tell them
my secret, did you?!

10:41.503 --> 10:43.501
Look at them,
they're so in love.

10:43.502 --> 10:45.473
They can't keep their
hands off of each other.

10:45.474 --> 10:48.643
Get your hands off me. I
haven't said anything.

10:48.644 --> 10:50.825
This is ridiculous. I'm
going to say something.

10:50.826 --> 10:53.123
- Ally, wait, I...
- I'm sorry, guys.

10:53.124 --> 10:56.779
I can't keep pretending.
We know your secret.

10:56.780 --> 10:58.553
Fine, you got us!

10:58.554 --> 11:01.090
I knew it! You and
Trish are dating.

11:01.091 --> 11:03.371
Huh? What?

11:03.693 --> 11:05.332
Ewe!

11:05.333 --> 11:08.560
No, my secret is that I
love romance movies.

11:08.561 --> 11:12.058
Trish caught me at the theater when she
was on a date with her new boyfriend.

11:12.059 --> 11:17.330
I knew you had a new boyfriend.
So if it's not Dez, who is it?

11:17.331 --> 11:19.980
I've been secretly dating Trent.

11:19.981 --> 11:22.009
My new back-up dancer?

11:22.010 --> 11:23.902
How long has this been going on?

11:23.903 --> 11:29.803
Well, it all started in third grade
when I saw "Letters From a Lover Lost."

11:30.332 --> 11:33.487
I'm talking about
Trish and Trent.

11:33.488 --> 11:35.570
It's only been a week.

11:35.571 --> 11:39.260
But we saw you and Dez
hugging at the locker.

11:39.261 --> 11:44.365
Oh, I was so happy that Trent got the
dancing gig that I had to hug somebody.

11:44.366 --> 11:48.406
Wait, back up. Dez, you
like romance movies?

11:48.407 --> 11:50.538
No, I love them!

11:50.539 --> 11:53.407
The passion, the
heartache, the emotion.

11:53.408 --> 11:57.869
They live the love we
can only dare to dream.

11:57.870 --> 12:00.314
Can we just focus on
one secret at a time?

12:00.315 --> 12:03.350
Trish, how come you didn't
tell me about Trent?

12:03.351 --> 12:05.812
Because I didn't want the
fact that we were going out,

12:05.813 --> 12:08.322
to influence Austin's
decision on who to hire.

12:08.323 --> 12:10.789
You didn't want to
influence my decision?

12:10.790 --> 12:12.558
You're kidding me, right?

12:12.559 --> 12:16.231
Pick Trent, pick Trent, pick Trent,
pick Trent, pick Trent, pick Trent!

12:16.232 --> 12:21.335
Pick him, pick him, pick
Trent, pick Trent, pick Trent!

12:21.336 --> 12:26.240
It means a lot to me that he
was hired on his own merit.

12:26.241 --> 12:28.895
Hey, guys. Ally, Dez.

12:28.896 --> 12:32.472
- Sorry, what was your name again?
- They know about us.

12:32.473 --> 12:34.844
And you guys are cool with it?

12:34.845 --> 12:37.905
Totally cool with it.

12:38.420 --> 12:40.670
Austin, I promise we're
not going to let our

12:40.671 --> 12:42.999
relationship get in the
way of team Austin.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.298
Awesome. So, Trent, what do you
say we get back to rehearsal?

12:45.299 --> 12:47.144
- Let's do it.
- Oh, he can't.

12:47.145 --> 12:49.296
I'm making Trent take me to
see "The Wedding Diary."

12:49.297 --> 12:52.957
It starts in like 15 minutes.

12:53.067 --> 12:55.713
"The Wedding Diary"
is out already?

12:55.714 --> 13:00.102
Listen, guys, I have to go.
I have practice for...

13:00.103 --> 13:02.143
Sports.

13:08.105 --> 13:10.836
In case I cry during the...

13:10.837 --> 13:12.877
Sports.

13:21.567 --> 13:23.492
My best friend has a boyfriend.

13:23.493 --> 13:25.399
My best friend has a boyfriend.

13:25.400 --> 13:28.608
- My best friend has...
- Ally, please stop singing that song.

13:28.609 --> 13:30.874
I just love love.

13:30.875 --> 13:33.470
So tell me, what's Trent like?

13:33.471 --> 13:36.633
He treats me so great. And
he's so much fun to be around.

13:36.634 --> 13:39.653
Look at this bracelet he got
me for our one-week-iversary.

13:39.654 --> 13:42.894
It says, "Trent's boo."

13:43.829 --> 13:48.449
I haven't seen you this happy since
Dez got that tuba stuck on his head.

13:48.450 --> 13:51.464
That was a good day.

13:51.465 --> 13:55.444
Listen, Ally, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about this right away.

13:55.445 --> 13:58.865
That's okay. I understand.

13:58.927 --> 14:00.125
I gotta run.

14:00.126 --> 14:02.608
I'm gonna get fired
from my job at the nail

14:02.620 --> 14:05.113
salon so I can spend
more time with my boo.

14:05.114 --> 14:06.700
Oh.

14:06.701 --> 14:09.019
Babe, please don't be mad.

14:09.020 --> 14:14.920
You know I only started dating Trish to
get the gig as Austin's back-up dancer.

14:16.096 --> 14:17.883
How do I know you're
not just saying that?

14:17.884 --> 14:23.307
You haven't even gotten me anything
for our three-week-iversary.

14:23.308 --> 14:26.008
I got you this.

14:26.534 --> 14:28.942
"Trent's boo"?!

14:28.943 --> 14:31.283
I love it.

14:32.537 --> 14:34.129
You're gonna break
up with her, right?

14:34.130 --> 14:35.599
Yes. Yeah, I just...

14:35.600 --> 14:37.517
I have to figure out how
to let her down easy,

14:37.518 --> 14:41.958
you know, so I can
still keep the gig.

14:44.411 --> 14:47.271
Trish's boo has another boo?

14:47.272 --> 14:49.132
Boo!

14:58.299 --> 15:00.238
Great to see you, mom.

15:00.239 --> 15:02.302
Oh! You too, Ricky.

15:02.303 --> 15:03.388
How's Africa?

15:03.389 --> 15:06.518
Oh, it's great. This has
been one of the most,

15:06.519 --> 15:09.800
fascinating research
expeditions yet.

15:09.801 --> 15:12.148
Okay, Ricky, don't
touch my book.

15:12.149 --> 15:14.909
Give me my book.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.250
Hey, Ally, guess what?

15:17.251 --> 15:20.997
Lula the gorilla... She
gave birth to twins.

15:20.998 --> 15:22.455
Aw!

15:22.456 --> 15:26.146
I named this one Ally,
because she's so creative.

15:26.147 --> 15:29.405
And this one Trish,
because she's so tough.

15:29.406 --> 15:32.003
And also because
she sleeps a lot.

15:32.004 --> 15:36.903
Speaking of Trish, I need some advice.
She has a new boyfriend...

15:36.904 --> 15:39.438
Oh, I love love!

15:39.439 --> 15:41.241
Your best friend
has a boyfriend!

15:41.242 --> 15:43.559
Your best friend
has a boyfriend!

15:43.560 --> 15:48.314
Yeah. But I found out that he's only
using her to get in with Austin.

15:48.315 --> 15:51.688
- She's going to be devastated.
- Oh.

15:51.689 --> 15:53.456
That's tough.

15:53.457 --> 15:55.694
But you're going to
have to tell her.

15:55.695 --> 15:58.424
You'd want her to tell you if
it was the other way around.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.945
You're right.

16:01.082 --> 16:03.429
Thanks, mom. I love you.

16:03.430 --> 16:06.120
I love you too.

16:06.121 --> 16:10.403
Would you like to see video of
Lula giving birth to the twins?

16:10.404 --> 16:12.324
Uh...

16:13.274 --> 16:18.314
Sorry, mom. You're cutting...
Talk to you later.

16:22.216 --> 16:24.886
- You say bye first.
- No, you say bye first.

16:24.887 --> 16:26.644
- You say bye.
- You say bye!

16:26.645 --> 16:28.653
- No, you say bye.
- Nuh-uh, you say bye.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.514
Bye!

16:30.602 --> 16:32.392
Okay.

16:32.393 --> 16:35.382
I'll see you later.

16:35.383 --> 16:37.386
What was that all about?

16:37.387 --> 16:39.299
Trish, we gotta talk.

16:39.300 --> 16:40.903
What is it?

16:40.904 --> 16:42.824
Uh...

16:42.958 --> 16:45.074
My mom named a baby
gorilla after you.

16:45.075 --> 16:47.415
Really? Aw!

16:49.039 --> 16:51.019
And...

16:51.793 --> 16:53.705
Trent has another girlfriend
and he's only using

16:53.706 --> 16:57.867
you so he can be
Austin's back-up dancer.

16:57.868 --> 16:59.956
Please, that's ridiculous...

16:59.957 --> 17:02.453
That you would be so jealous
that I have a boyfriend,

17:02.454 --> 17:05.906
that you would make up
such a horrible story!

17:05.906 --> 17:07.454
But, wait.

17:07.455 --> 17:10.406
You wouldn't make up a story
like this, would you?

17:10.407 --> 17:12.242
Because you're my best friend.

17:12.242 --> 17:14.511
And you would never want
to hurt my feelings.

17:14.512 --> 17:19.130
And this was probably really hard
for you to tell me, which means...

17:19.131 --> 17:21.891
It must be true.

17:21.994 --> 17:24.275
That jerk!

17:25.944 --> 17:28.613
How could he do this to me?

17:28.614 --> 17:31.674
I'm so sorry, Trish.

17:32.263 --> 17:34.852
We are totally ready to
shoot this dance video.

17:34.853 --> 17:36.925
I worked out this move where
me and Trent do this thing...

17:36.926 --> 17:40.079
You can't use Trent.
He's no good.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.414
What are you talking about?
He's really good.

17:42.415 --> 17:44.781
He's one of the best dancers
I've ever worked with.

17:44.782 --> 17:49.528
No, he has another girlfriend.
He's just using Trish.

17:49.529 --> 17:52.229
That's terrible.

17:59.357 --> 18:01.158
Oh hey, guys.

18:01.159 --> 18:03.494
Okay, Trish, give him
a piece of your mind.

18:03.495 --> 18:05.634
It's all you.

18:05.635 --> 18:08.039
- Listen, Trent, you...
- I'll handle this!

18:08.040 --> 18:11.001
Listen, Trent, you mess with
Trish, you mess with all of us.

18:11.002 --> 18:13.370
She is a great person and
you don't deserve her.

18:13.371 --> 18:16.507
Yeah, nobody gets to be
mean to Trish except me.

18:16.508 --> 18:18.542
We're mean to each other.
It's kind of our thing.

18:18.543 --> 18:20.544
Well, technically, she's more
mean to me than I am to her.

18:20.545 --> 18:23.156
Okay, that'll do, Dez.

18:23.157 --> 18:24.877
I thought you really liked me.

18:24.878 --> 18:29.582
I do really like you. You're
cute, you're fun, you're tough.

18:29.583 --> 18:33.815
And if I wasn't so focused on my career,
I could totally see us together.

18:33.816 --> 18:35.726
What about your girlfriend?

18:35.727 --> 18:39.387
Mmm. Right. There's that too.

18:40.447 --> 18:45.307
I'm sorry, Trish. I never
meant to hurt you.

18:45.503 --> 18:47.304
Well, sorry or
not, you're fired.

18:47.305 --> 18:49.059
Yeah! You heard him.

18:49.060 --> 18:52.217
Wait, this isn't about Trish.

18:52.218 --> 18:55.165
I think you're just firing me because
you're afraid I'm going to show you up.

18:55.166 --> 18:58.059
Please. Nobody's a better
dancer than Austin.

18:58.060 --> 19:00.036
Really?

19:00.037 --> 19:04.252
I challenge Austin
Moon to a dance-off.

19:04.253 --> 19:07.133
Oh no, he didn't!

19:08.126 --> 19:11.893
You don't need to prove
anything to him, Austin.

19:11.894 --> 19:14.834
You're right, Ally.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.054
Hear that, everybody?

19:17.055 --> 19:19.815
Austin is scared.

19:22.507 --> 19:25.520
Do it, Austin. Do it for me.

19:25.521 --> 19:28.461
Humiliate that jerk.

19:33.551 --> 19:35.385
- Let's do this.
- Woo!

19:35.386 --> 19:38.057
Yeah! Dance-off!

19:38.058 --> 19:41.058
We got a dance-off!

19:42.987 --> 19:47.487
<i>I'm so fresh I'm so
fresh right now...</i>

19:51.630 --> 19:53.779
<i>Yeah. My, I'm so fresh.</i>

19:53.780 --> 19:55.923
<i>Organically farmed and
picked to my best.</i>

19:55.924 --> 19:59.504
<i>High tops and my crisp white shades.
Girls pass me by like, "oh, my days!"</i>

19:59.505 --> 20:02.923
<i>I bet you've never seen style this wild.
Step out the car with...</i>

20:02.924 --> 20:05.504
- Woo!
- Yeah!

20:06.868 --> 20:09.293
<i>Ain't nobody that's
fresher than me.</i>

20:09.294 --> 20:12.537
<i>You ain't fresher than me, ain't
nobody that's fresher than me.</i>

20:12.538 --> 20:14.440
<i>Yeah, you ain't fresher than me.</i>

20:14.441 --> 20:17.988
<i>Ladies say, "who's that guy?
Who's that guy? He's so fly".</i>

20:17.989 --> 20:19.861
<i>Ladies say, "who's that guy?"</i>

20:19.862 --> 20:21.962
<i>Yeah, that's me, that's
me, that's right.</i>

20:21.963 --> 20:25.747
<i>Ladies say, "who's that guy?
Who's that guy? He's so fly".</i>

20:25.748 --> 20:27.097
<i>Ladies say, "who's that guy?"</i>

20:27.098 --> 20:29.216
<i>Yeah, that's me, that's
me, that's right.</i>

20:29.217 --> 20:32.854
<i>Ladies say, "who's that guy?
Who's that guy? He's so fly".</i>

20:32.855 --> 20:34.541
<i>Ladies say, "who's that guy?"</i>

20:34.542 --> 20:36.458
<i>Yeah, that's me, that's
me, that's right.</i>

20:36.459 --> 20:40.362
<i>Ladies say, "who's that guy?
Who's that guy? He's so fly".</i>

20:40.363 --> 20:42.943
- Yeah!
- Woo!

20:44.534 --> 20:48.093
Austin, Austin, Austin, Austin!

20:48.094 --> 20:50.948
Austin, Austin, Austin!

20:50.949 --> 20:54.069
Austin, Austin, Austin!

21:01.618 --> 21:05.082
So I put the video of the Austin-Trent
dance-off on the website.

21:05.083 --> 21:07.959
And it already got a ton of hits.
People love it.

21:07.960 --> 21:10.824
- What up?!
- Oh, that's cool.

21:10.825 --> 21:12.728
But I still feel bad for Trish.

21:12.729 --> 21:16.836
To have her first love end so badly.
She must be crushed.

21:16.837 --> 21:19.208
Like in that movie,
"First Love."

21:19.209 --> 21:25.109
Charlotte never loved again after the
unnamed sailor betrayed her heart.

21:27.887 --> 21:30.746
Dez and I might have
watched it last night.

21:30.747 --> 21:32.428
Austin cried.

21:32.429 --> 21:34.297
I did not. I had
something in my eye.

21:34.298 --> 21:36.698
Yeah, tears.

21:38.621 --> 21:40.723
I'm sure Trish will be fine.

21:40.724 --> 21:42.658
It's just going to take time.

21:42.659 --> 21:45.078
It might be months, maybe years.

21:45.079 --> 21:47.496
Guess who got a new boyfriend!

21:47.497 --> 21:48.645
Roger?

21:48.646 --> 21:50.426
Yep. And just so you know,

21:50.427 --> 21:54.611
he asked me out after you hired him
to be your new back-up dancer.

21:54.612 --> 21:56.472
Bye.

21:58.161 --> 22:02.986
Now that we're all here, let's celebrate
the awesome new dance video...

22:02.987 --> 22:06.211
With a cake from Mini's.

22:06.212 --> 22:11.252
- I call the big piece!
- Okay wait, wait. Stop!
