WEBVTT

00:04.738 --> 00:05.273
COME ON, HENRY,
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS

00:05.306 --> 00:06.707
AND SAY
YOUR PRAYERS.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.276
GRANDPA, CAN I PRAY
FOR THE POWER

00:08.309 --> 00:11.512
TO BLOW THINGS UP
WITH MY EYES?

00:11.545 --> 00:13.747
YEAH, I DON'T SEE
WHY NOT.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.149
SEAN, I'M HOME!

00:15.183 --> 00:16.484
HEY, GUYS.
WHERE'S SEAN?

00:16.517 --> 00:18.786
HE RAN OVER
TO THE O'KEEFE'S
NEXT DOOR.

00:18.819 --> 00:20.621
OH, GOD.
WHERE'S LILY?

00:20.654 --> 00:22.423
I THINK HE WAS
GONNA GO GET HER.

00:22.456 --> 00:23.524
OH, GOD.

00:23.557 --> 00:27.228
MOM, GRANDPA SAYS
I'M TOO OLD TO SLEEP
IN MY PAJAMAS.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.696
OH, WELL, YOU'RE NOT.

00:28.729 --> 00:32.600
I SLEEP IN THE NUDE.
I LIKE THE FEEL.

00:32.633 --> 00:33.334
I DO!

00:33.367 --> 00:36.704
YOU'RE WEARING
PAJAMAS. UPSTAIRS.

00:37.638 --> 00:38.439
EDDIE!

00:38.472 --> 00:40.441
I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
STOP PANICKING.

00:40.474 --> 00:41.242
OH, COME ON, WHOA!

00:41.275 --> 00:42.276
HEY, I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO CALLED 911.

00:42.310 --> 00:45.279
I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO SCREAMED
LIKE A LITTLE GIRL.

00:45.313 --> 00:47.115
WHAT? DID YOU
FIND LILY?

00:47.148 --> 00:48.216
YEAH.
AND?

00:48.249 --> 00:50.151
UH, THINGS ARE
LOOKING UP.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.386
MOM, HENRY DOESN'T
HAVE ANY PANTS ON.

00:52.420 --> 00:55.423
OHH! PUT ON
YOUR PANTS, HENRY!

00:55.456 --> 00:57.425
Henry: I DON'T
WANT TO!

00:57.458 --> 01:00.828
HE SAID HE'S SLEEPING
GRANDPA-STYLE.

01:04.432 --> 01:05.533
ALL RIGHT,
I'M COMING UP!

01:05.566 --> 01:07.568
AND I AM NOT DONE
WITH YOU!

01:07.601 --> 01:08.869
WHAT'S
SHE SO WORRIED
ABOUT?

01:08.902 --> 01:11.172
UH, N-NOTHING.
IT'S JUST, UM,

01:11.205 --> 01:13.207
EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON,
ME AND EDDIE HAD TO GO

01:13.241 --> 01:14.475
BY THE DRUGSTORE
TO PICK UP,

01:14.508 --> 01:17.178
UH, A PERSONAL ITEM.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.079
CAN I HELP YOU?

01:19.113 --> 01:22.650
OH, HI. NO,
JUST BROWSING,
REALLY. THANKS.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.585
HE'S GOT TERRIBLE
JOCK ITCH.

01:24.618 --> 01:27.321
OH, JEEZ! IT'S NOT
TERRIBLE. HEH HEH!

01:27.355 --> 01:29.623
OH, COME ON. YOU'VE BEEN
DIGGING AT IT.

01:29.657 --> 01:31.292
AISLE 3,
ON THE RIGHT.

01:31.325 --> 01:32.626
IT--IT'S NOT
TERRIBLE!

01:32.660 --> 01:36.530
IT'S JUST--JUST
AN AVERAGE CASE
AT BEST.

01:37.265 --> 01:41.569
HEY, LOOK AT
THAT TWITCHY KID
AT THE CONDOM RACK.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.605
HEH HEH HEH!

01:44.638 --> 01:47.408
YOU REMEMBER
WHEN WE WERE HIS AGE
BUYING CONDOMS?

01:47.441 --> 01:48.709
COME ON, COME ON!

01:48.742 --> 01:51.245
COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON!

01:51.279 --> 01:54.582
COME ON,
TWIST THE KNOB, MAN.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.686
ALL RIGHT!
HEH HEH--

01:58.719 --> 02:00.354
OH! OH, YOU IDIOT!

02:00.388 --> 02:03.157
YOU--YOU DID
THE WRONG ONE!

02:03.191 --> 02:04.358
NO, I DIDN'T.

02:04.392 --> 02:05.893
YEAH, I GOT ASPIRIN!

02:05.926 --> 02:06.827
TURN THIS ONE.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.028
AW, MAN! I DON'T HAVE
ANY MORE QUARTERS!

02:08.061 --> 02:12.300
CLAUDIA'S WAITING
FOR ME RIGHT NOW,
AND I'VE GOT ASPIRIN.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.402
TELL HER
IT'S THE PILL.

02:14.435 --> 02:17.371
YOU--NO ONE...

02:18.572 --> 02:23.344
THOSE WERE STUPID,
STUPID TIMES.

02:23.577 --> 02:26.647
HEY, ISN'T THAT
THE KID FROM NEXT DOOR?

02:26.680 --> 02:27.948
WHERE?

02:27.981 --> 02:32.152
BUYING THE CONDOMS.
THAT'S LILY'S BOYFRIEND.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.223
BRAD O'KEEFE?!

02:35.256 --> 02:38.359
BRAD O'KEEFE WAS
BUYING CONDOMS?

02:38.392 --> 02:40.261
12 PACK.

02:40.661 --> 02:43.297
THE KID THINKS BIG.

02:44.332 --> 02:45.399
SEAN, THERE'S
A FIRE ENGINE

02:45.433 --> 02:46.767
OUTSIDE
THE O'KEEFE'S!

02:46.800 --> 02:48.702
WHAT? UH...

02:48.736 --> 02:58.779
MAN, THEY TAKE
THAT 911 STUFF
SO SERIOUSLY.

02:58.779 --> 03:06.987
MAN, THEY TAKE
THAT 911 STUFF
SO SERIOUSLY.

03:07.020 --> 03:07.988
YOU GUYS, THERE'S
A FIRE NEXT DOOR!

03:08.021 --> 03:09.957
OK, NOW, THERE'S NO FIRE.
THERE'S A FIRE ENGINE.

03:09.990 --> 03:10.891
CAN WE GO
SEE THE FIRE?

03:10.924 --> 03:12.526
WHOA, AREN'T YOU GUYS
SUPPOSED TO BE IN BED?

03:12.560 --> 03:13.927
NOT WHEN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD'S
BURNING DOWN.

03:13.961 --> 03:16.330
ALL RIGHT,
HEY, HEY, HEY!
THERE'S NO FIRE!

03:16.364 --> 03:17.465
AND IT'S PAST
YOUR BEDTIME.

03:17.498 --> 03:18.332
WHAT--WHY DO I
HAVE TO GO TO BED

03:18.366 --> 03:19.900
WHEN HE GOES TO BED?
I'M OLDER THAN HIM.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.435
YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO BED
AT HIS BEDTIME.

03:21.469 --> 03:22.770
HE'S GOING TO BED
AT YOUR BEDTIME.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.772
THEN WHY DOES HE GET
SPECIAL TREATMENT?

03:24.805 --> 03:26.574
BECAUSE I'M CUTER.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.476
OK, BOTH OF YOU
UPSTAIRS.

03:28.509 --> 03:29.176
COME ON.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.544
THOSE FIREMEN
LOOK ANGRY.

03:30.578 --> 03:33.547
THEY SHOULD BE PSYCHED
THERE'S NO FIRE.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.283
WHAT HAPPENED
OVER THERE, SEAN?

03:35.316 --> 03:36.550
DIDN'T YOU STICK
TO OUR STRATEGY?

03:36.584 --> 03:38.986
STRATEGY? COME ON,
WHAT STRATEGY?

03:39.019 --> 03:41.689
CLAUD! CLAUD!

03:41.722 --> 03:43.291
I SAW BRAD--

03:43.324 --> 03:45.659
BRAD O'KEEFE
BUYING CONDOMS.

03:45.693 --> 03:46.394
WHAT?

03:46.427 --> 03:48.362
BRAD O'KEEFE WAS
BUYING CONDOMS!

03:48.396 --> 03:50.264
OH, MY GOD.
I CAN'T GO TO WORK.

03:50.298 --> 03:51.599
NO, NO, WAIT,
I HAVE TO GO TO WORK

03:51.632 --> 03:53.367
BECAUSE I'M FILLING IN
FOR REBECCA.

03:53.401 --> 03:54.335
OH, GOD!
OH, MY GOD.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.404
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL DEAL WITH IT.
I'VE GOT IT.

03:56.437 --> 03:58.439
YOU SURE?
YES, ABSOLUTELY.

03:58.472 --> 03:59.640
BUT I'M OPEN
TO SUGGESTIONS.

03:59.673 --> 04:02.410
ALL RIGHT, JUST, UM,
TRY TO ACT COOL.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.911
RIGHT, BE COOL. COOL.

04:03.944 --> 04:06.280
YES. AND KEEP HER
VERY CLOSE
TO THIS HOUSE.

04:06.314 --> 04:07.014
RIGHT.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.382
AND, UM, DON'T
TALK DOWN TO HER.

04:08.416 --> 04:09.149
JUST BE OPEN TO HER

04:09.182 --> 04:10.884
AND FOLLOW YOUR
NATURAL INSTINCTS.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.620
GOOD. RIGHT. OK.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.655
NO, NO. WAIT, WAIT!
YOU CAN'T--

04:14.688 --> 04:16.357
DON'T FOLLOW YOUR
NATURAL INSTINCTS!

04:16.390 --> 04:18.826
RIGHT! DON'T--YES!
YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO?

04:18.859 --> 04:20.661
I'M JUST--I'M GONNA
LAY DOWN THE LAW.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.796
NO, THAT'S ONE
OF YOUR INSTINCTS!

04:22.830 --> 04:24.632
WHEN YOU FORBID HER
TO DO SOMETHING,

04:24.665 --> 04:25.699
SHE'S JUST GONNA
TURN AROUND

04:25.733 --> 04:27.635
AND DO IT ANYWAY
JUST TO SPITE YOU.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.303
OH, RIGHT. GOD, NO!

04:29.337 --> 04:30.170
NO, NO, LISTEN!

04:30.203 --> 04:31.905
JUST STEER
CLEAR OF HER
TILL I GET HOME.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.575
OK, RIGHT. I'M GONNA
STEER CLEAR OF HER

04:34.608 --> 04:35.876
TILL YOU GET HOME. OK.

04:35.909 --> 04:36.910
STEER CLEAR.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.313
HOME. OK.

04:41.682 --> 04:42.916
NO, WAIT!

04:42.950 --> 04:43.751
YOU CAN'T STEER
CLEAR OF HER

04:43.784 --> 04:45.819
BECAUSE YOU GOTTA
KEEP AN EYE ON HER.

04:45.853 --> 04:46.787
OH, MY GOD, YEAH!

04:46.820 --> 04:48.989
JUST STAY CLOSE
TO HER AND DON'T
TALK TO HER.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.924
RIGHT!
LOVE YOU!

04:50.958 --> 04:52.360
ALL RIGHT,
LOVE YOU.

04:56.964 --> 04:57.931
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
YOU GOTTA
TALK TO HER

04:57.965 --> 05:00.701
BECAUSE OTHERWISE
SHE'S GONNA
GET SUSPICIOUS.

05:00.734 --> 05:01.702
YEAH!

05:01.735 --> 05:03.471
SO, UM, ACT NATURAL.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.439
NATURAL! HA HA HA!

05:05.473 --> 05:06.239
YEAH! GOOD!

05:06.273 --> 05:07.775
THERE'S
SOME GOOD ADVICE
IN THERE.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.678
WHERE?
I DON'T KNOW.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.713
I DON'T SEE
WHY YOU'RE SO WORRIED.

05:12.746 --> 05:15.383
THAT O'KEEFE BOY IS
SUCH A MILQUETOAST.

05:15.416 --> 05:16.350
ALL RIGHT,
WHOA, WHOA, OK.

05:16.384 --> 05:19.787
HE MIGHT BE
A MILQUETOAST,
BUT SHE LIKES HIM.

05:21.755 --> 05:22.856
HEY!

05:22.890 --> 05:23.491
HI.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.025
READY TO GO
TO THE MOVIES?

05:25.058 --> 05:27.695
I CAN'T.
I HAVE OTHER PLANS.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.698
OK, OK! IF YOU'RE
GONNA MAKE

05:30.731 --> 05:31.699
SUCH A HUGE DEAL
ABOUT IT,

05:31.732 --> 05:32.866
WE'LL GO
TO THE MOVIES.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.403
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
YOUR OTHER PLANS?

05:35.436 --> 05:37.838
I DON'T HAVE
OTHER PLANS.

05:37.871 --> 05:40.608
OH. I'M SORRY.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.910
UGH!

05:45.913 --> 05:47.147
SHE USES HIM
FOR A DOORMAT.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.817
DAD, YOU DON'T SPEAK
TEENAGE GIRL, ALL RIGHT?

05:49.850 --> 05:51.852
DOORMAT TRANSLATES
INTO "ME LIKEY."

05:51.885 --> 05:55.989
YEAH? THEN WHY
DOESN'T SHE SAY,
"ME LIKEY?"

05:56.023 --> 05:57.791
NO, NO. SHE'D
ONLY SAY THAT

05:57.825 --> 05:59.760
IF SHE WANTED
TO REALLY BLOW HIM OFF.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.695
UGH! THANK GOD
I HAD BOYS.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.597
THANKS, DAD,
MEANS A LOT.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.132
I DIDN'T MEAN YOU.

06:05.599 --> 06:07.901
LOOK, OK, I KNEW
SHE LIKED THIS KID BRAD, OK?

06:07.935 --> 06:09.670
AND I JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO SIT AROUND

06:09.703 --> 06:10.638
AND WATCH HIM SUFFER,

06:10.671 --> 06:12.573
SO I GAVE HIM
A LITTLE TALK,

06:12.606 --> 06:14.775
A LITTLE
CONFIDENCE BOOSTER.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.411
SHE LIKES ME?

06:17.445 --> 06:18.311
ABSOLUTELY.

06:18.345 --> 06:22.750
SO THAT'S
WHY SHE ACTS
LIKE SHE HATES ME.

06:22.783 --> 06:25.052
SEE, BRAD,
WOMEN DON'T ALWAYS MEAN

06:25.085 --> 06:26.487
WHAT THEY APPEAR
TO MEAN.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.722
THEY--THEY SEND
CONFUSING SIGNALS.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.157
LIKE, YOU KNOW MY WIFE.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.525
OH, YEAH!

06:31.559 --> 06:33.661
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
CALM DOWN.

06:33.694 --> 06:34.762
OK, SEE,
THERE WAS A TIME

06:34.795 --> 06:36.964
WHEN I THOUGHT CLAUDIA
DIDN'T LIKE ME.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.867
WHOO! OWW!

06:39.900 --> 06:41.435
HEY, CLAUDIA BUSTAMONTE!

06:41.469 --> 06:43.937
HEH HEH.
CAN I HELP YOU,
FINNERTY?

06:43.971 --> 06:44.705
HEY, I GOT
SOME NEW WOOFERS

06:44.738 --> 06:46.807
IN MY STEREO SYSTEM.
CHECK IT OUT.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.777
OH, YEAH!

06:49.810 --> 06:52.780
HA HA! WHOO!

06:52.813 --> 06:53.581
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

06:53.614 --> 06:56.717
SOUNDS PRETTY AWESOME,
HUH? HA HA HA!

07:02.956 --> 07:05.926
I'M OK! IT'S COOL!

07:07.194 --> 07:08.696
HOW'D IT WORK OUT?

07:08.729 --> 07:10.964
BRAD, WE'RE MARRIED.

07:10.998 --> 07:11.699
THAT'S COOL.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.667
YEAH, YEAH.
SO JUST RELAX, MAN.

07:13.701 --> 07:14.735
BE CONFIDENT,
ALL RIGHT?

07:14.768 --> 07:17.505
AND THAT WAY LILY
WILL STOP WALKING
ALL OVER YOU.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.872
YOU KNOW,
YOU GOTTA JUST--

07:18.906 --> 07:20.808
YOU GOTTA SHOW THE WORLD
HOW COOL YOU CAN BE.

07:20.841 --> 07:24.077
YOU KNOW, CUT CLASS
AND, UH, START A BAND.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.046
THROW A PARTY.

07:26.079 --> 07:26.914
YEAH, YEAH, LIKE...

07:26.947 --> 07:29.249
LIKE A "COMING OUT
AS A COOL GUY" PARTY!

07:29.282 --> 07:32.686
YEAH! YEAH, JUST DON'T
CALL IT THAT.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.455
SO YOU TOLD HIM
TO THROW A PARTY?

07:36.056 --> 07:39.793
UH, OK, THAT'S
A VERY LIBERAL
INTERPRETATION

07:39.827 --> 07:41.762
OF WHAT I SAID.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.096
YOU SHOULDN'T GET
ALL BUDDY-BUDDY

07:43.130 --> 07:45.065
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER'S
BOYFRIEND.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.134
THEN THE FEAR SUBSIDES.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.669
OK.

07:48.702 --> 07:49.970
YEAH, ALL COMMUNICATION
SHOULD COME

07:50.003 --> 07:51.672
IN THE FORM
OF A WARNING.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.541
ALL RIGHT.
THANKS, DAD.

07:53.574 --> 07:56.544
I'M GONNA BE A FIREMAN
WHEN I GROW UP.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.111
Jimmy:
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.848
I CAN BE ANYTHING
I WANT TO BE.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.182
NO, YOU CAN'T!

08:02.215 --> 08:04.752
LAST WEEK YOU WANTED
TO BE A ROBOT.

08:04.785 --> 08:07.154
I CAN BE A ROBOT.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.689
YOU COULDN'T.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.924
FINE. I'LL BE A FIREMAN.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.192
YOU DON'T HAVE
THE STUFF.

08:12.225 --> 08:15.062
WHEN WE WENT CAMPING,
WHO PUT OUT THAT FIRE?

08:15.095 --> 08:16.564
YEAH, BUT WHEN
YOU'RE A FIREMAN

08:16.597 --> 08:17.965
YOU CAN'T PEE
ON A BURNING BUILDING.

08:17.998 --> 08:21.602

08:21.635 --> 08:22.836
WELL, THEN I GUESS
YOUR BED

08:22.870 --> 08:25.138

CATCHING FIRE

UGH! MOM!

08:26.173 --> 08:29.042

08:29.076 --> 08:30.611
LOOK, OK, LOOK,

08:32.880 --> 08:36.049
WE BATTING,
LIKE, .666, HUH?

08:37.885 --> 08:38.752
THIS ISN'T BASEBALL.

08:38.786 --> 08:39.653
NO, I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT BASEBALL, BABY.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.254
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THAT PART OF THE OMEN

08:41.288 --> 08:42.022
WHEN THEY LOOK
ON HIS SCALP

08:42.055 --> 08:45.025
AND SEE THE MARK
OF THE BEAST.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.728
AW, COME ON, BABY,
I'M JUST TRYING
TO BE OPTIMISTIC.

08:47.761 --> 08:50.698
LOOK, THIS WHOLE THING
WITH LILY WAS REALLY HARD.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.801

BRAD'S PARENTS
ARE OUT OF TOWN.
HE'S HAVING A PARTY.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.974
OH, UH, LILY, LISTEN.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.209

NOT TO DO DRUGS?

09:17.224 --> 09:19.192
OK.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.094
I WON'T.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.997
DON'T WAIT UP!

09:24.031 --> 09:25.966
UM...

09:25.999 --> 09:27.935
WOW,

SO YOU JUST
LET HER GO?

09:31.639 --> 09:33.641
LOOK, YOU TOLD ME
I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING!

09:33.674 --> 09:35.242
I DIDN'T TELL YOU
TO DO NOTHING!

09:35.275 --> 09:37.077
WELL, WHAT WAS
I SUPPOSED TO DO?

09:37.110 --> 09:39.046
SOMETHING!

09:39.079 --> 09:40.781
OH, WE DID
SOMETHING.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.983
OH, WHAT?

09:52.025 --> 09:54.094
UM, DAD,
ARE YOU OK?

09:54.127 --> 09:55.062
UH, YEAH,

09:55.095 --> 09:57.097
WELL, BECAUSE

09:57.130 --> 09:58.999
ALL THE WAY

09:59.032 --> 10:01.635
HUH? OH!

10:02.235 --> 10:03.470
OH, MAN, THESE GIRLS
KEEP STARING AT ME.

10:03.503 --> 10:06.974
YEAH, PROBABLY BECAUSE
YOU'RE JUMPING UP
AND DOWN LIKE A GEEK.

10:07.007 --> 10:09.810
I THINK NOT.

10:12.813 --> 10:16.183
LOOK, LOOK, CAN WE
PLEASE JUST TRY
TO IGNORE THE PARTY?

10:16.216 --> 10:17.117
ALL RIGHT, GUYS?

10:17.150 --> 10:18.686
I'M TRYING, BUT LOOK,
LOOK. CHECK THIS OUT.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.153
WILL YOU CHECK THIS OUT?

10:20.187 --> 10:22.022
WHAT?

10:25.158 --> 10:28.028
YES, HELLO, OFFICER?

10:28.061 --> 10:29.129
YEAH, I'D LIKE TO REPORT

10:29.162 --> 10:32.365
A LOUD AND OUT OF CONTROL
PARTY.

10:32.399 --> 10:35.168
WELL, I WANT IT SHUT DOWN.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.037
WELL, I'M
A PROPERTY OWNER,

10:37.070 --> 10:39.873
AND A TAXPAYER, AND I HAVE
A HEART CONDITION,

10:39.907 --> 10:44.144
AND THIS ROCK 'N' ROLL
MUSIC'S KILLING ME!

10:45.112 --> 10:47.748
Sean: WHOA, WHOA! WELL,
IF IT AIN'T THE FUZZ!

10:47.781 --> 10:49.349
MAN, WHY DON'T YOU LET
THE KIDS HAVE SOME FUN?

10:49.382 --> 10:52.686
YEAH,
SINCE WHEN IS PARTYING
AGAINST THE LAW?

10:52.720 --> 10:54.755
HEY, SKATEBOARDING
IS NOT A CRIME!

10:54.788 --> 10:56.156
HEY, WHOA, WHOA.
YOU SMELL SOMETHING?

10:56.189 --> 10:58.125
I SMELL BACON! YEAH!

10:58.158 --> 10:59.827
WH-WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT?

10:59.860 --> 11:01.061
YOU LOOKING AT ME?
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

11:01.094 --> 11:04.064
GET HIGH!
PIGS CAN'T FLY!

11:04.097 --> 11:04.898
DON'T LOOK
OVER HERE.

11:04.932 --> 11:06.299
ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT
DID YOU SAY TO LILY

11:06.333 --> 11:07.300
WHEN SHE CAME OUT?

11:07.334 --> 11:08.068
NOTHING.
GOOD.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.904
NO, NOT GOOD.
SHE NEVER CAME OUT.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.406
WHERE THE--

11:13.440 --> 11:14.875
GOD!

11:14.908 --> 11:16.844
UGH! THE COPS LEFT
OVER AN HOUR AGO.

11:16.877 --> 11:17.845
WHERE IS SHE?

11:17.878 --> 11:19.279
RIGHT THERE.
WHERE?

11:19.312 --> 11:21.014
THAT UPSTAIRS
ROOM.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.816
OH, GOD.

11:22.850 --> 11:23.817
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT?

11:23.851 --> 11:26.787
CHECK OUT
ALL THOSE CANDLES.

11:27.154 --> 11:29.256
I WISH MY FIRST TIME
HAD BEEN THAT ROMANTIC.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.157
SHUT UP!

11:30.190 --> 11:31.091
OH, I'M SORRY.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.259
SORRY, THAT WAS
INSENSITIVE.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.194
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT?

11:34.227 --> 11:35.262
YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA
GO OVER THERE

11:35.295 --> 11:36.730
AND GET LILY
RIGHT NOW.

11:36.764 --> 11:37.597
SHE'S GONNA
HATE YOU.

11:37.630 --> 11:40.333
A LOT OF PEOPLE HATE ME.
ARE YOU COMING?

11:43.470 --> 11:46.740
WHAT WERE
THEY LOOKING AT?!

11:50.110 --> 11:53.747
HEY, EDDIE, YOU GOT
A CREDIT CARD?

11:53.781 --> 11:56.116
YES, I DO.

11:57.284 --> 12:00.187
WHERE'D YOU GET
A GOLD CARD?

12:01.154 --> 12:03.991
IT'S YOURS.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.471
OH! GRR!

12:25.078 --> 12:25.913
WHAT WERE THEY DOING?

12:25.946 --> 12:28.281
THEY WERE PLAYING
WITH THE OUIJA BOARD.

12:28.315 --> 12:29.549
OH, THAT'S
A RELIEF.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.152
THEY'RE JUST
INTO SATANISM.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.922
GOD, DID LILY FREAK OUT?
WHAT SHE DO?

12:34.955 --> 12:39.759
UH, WELL, HONESTLY,
I THINK I HANDLED IT
PRETTY WELL.

12:41.161 --> 12:44.031
UM, UM...FIRE!

12:49.469 --> 12:50.470
MAN, THIS IS LAME.

12:50.503 --> 12:53.006
YEAH, THERE'S
NOTHING ON FIRE.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.942
HEY! HEY!

12:54.975 --> 12:58.045
CAN YOU SPRAY SOME FOAM
ON SOMETHING?

12:58.078 --> 12:59.847
WE DON'T USE FOAM, SON.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.281
THAT'S JUST USED
AT AIRPORTS.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.916
CAN YOU FOAM ME?

13:02.950 --> 13:05.886
NO, I CAN'T.
IS YOUR DAD HOME?

13:05.919 --> 13:09.356
IF I TELL YOU,
WILL YOU FOAM ME?

13:09.389 --> 13:10.423
NO.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.826
COME ON IN.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.996
DAD,
THEY COULDN'T
FIND ANY FIRE.

13:16.029 --> 13:16.997
WELL, DID THEY
EVEN LOOK?

13:17.030 --> 13:19.066
YES,
THEY LOOKED!

13:19.099 --> 13:20.968
WHAT EXACTLY
DID YOU THINK YOU SAW?

13:21.001 --> 13:22.569
WHOA! THERE'S NO
"I THINK" ABOUT IT.

13:22.602 --> 13:23.436
ALL RIGHT?
I KNOW WHAT I SAW,

13:23.470 --> 13:28.208
IT WAS ORANGE
AND FLICKERING
AND FIERY.

13:29.076 --> 13:31.144
WE FOUND CANDLES.

13:31.178 --> 13:33.847
DID YOU PUT THEM OUT?

13:33.881 --> 13:36.016
SIR, CALLING IN
A FALSE ALARM
IS A FELONY.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.018
OH, I SEE. TO BE
ON THE SAFE SIDE,

13:38.051 --> 13:40.187
WE SHOULD'VE SET
THE WHOLE HOUSE ON FIRE.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.990
THAT IS ALSO A FELONY.

13:43.023 --> 13:46.193
YOU GOT ALL THE ANGLES,
DON'T YOU?

13:48.161 --> 13:51.364
ALL RIGHT, LET'S
PACK UP THE HOSES!

13:51.398 --> 13:53.566
YOU'RE DOING
GOD'S WORK, SIR.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.402
DAD, HAVE YOU LOST
YOUR MIND?

13:55.435 --> 13:57.037
I WAS CONCERNED.

13:57.070 --> 13:57.704
OH!

13:57.737 --> 13:58.939
MOM, WHY ARE YOU
HUGGING ME?

13:58.972 --> 14:01.074
BECAUSE YOU WERE
PLAYING OUIJA.

14:01.108 --> 14:04.244
SHE--SHE'S JUST GLAD
TO HAVE YOU HOME.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.880
INTACT.
DAD.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.316
OK, WHAT IS
GOING ON?
YOU OK?

14:09.349 --> 14:10.951
YES, EXCEPT
FOR THE FACT

14:10.984 --> 14:15.055
THAT DAD SCARED
THE HELL OUT OF US.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.491
SPIRITS, TELL US

14:18.525 --> 14:23.263
WHO AMONG US WILL BE
THE FIRST TO DIE?

14:25.032 --> 14:26.533
OH, THIS IS
TOO CREEPY.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.535
SHH! IT'S MOVING.

14:28.568 --> 14:32.505
OH, NO. IT'S MOVING
TOWARDS "B".

14:33.540 --> 14:36.343
OH, NO! "B" FOR BRAD!

14:36.376 --> 14:41.314
SPIRITS, DOES "B"
STAND FOR BRAD?

14:46.519 --> 14:48.088
Girl: YES!

14:48.121 --> 14:50.690
OH, I'M GONNA DIE!

14:50.723 --> 14:54.227
WELL, NOT SOON.
JUST FIRST.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.029
SPIRITS...

14:56.063 --> 14:58.999
IS BRAD GOING
TO DIE SOON?

14:59.032 --> 15:01.168
DON'T ASK IT THAT!

15:02.669 --> 15:05.205
IT'S MOVING
TOWARDS "YES" AGAIN.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.242
WHA!

15:09.276 --> 15:10.677
MAYBE IT WAS A SPIRIT.

15:10.710 --> 15:14.147
IS IT COMING
FOR BRAD?

15:14.181 --> 15:15.248
ASK IT TO GO AWAY!

15:15.282 --> 15:17.250
IT DOESN'T WORK
THAT WAY!

15:26.126 --> 15:27.961
UM, UM...FIRE!

15:27.995 --> 15:31.198
I'M GONNA DIE!

15:31.231 --> 15:32.365
WE WERE TERRIFIED.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.734
YEAH, HEY, HEY!
I WAS TRAUMATIZED, TOO.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.303
BUT YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO BROKE IN!

15:36.336 --> 15:39.139
OK, NOW WE'RE PLAYING
THE BLAME GAME. GREAT.

15:42.409 --> 15:43.543
HEY, MR.
AND MRS. FINNERTY.

15:43.576 --> 15:46.046
JUST WANTED TO SAY
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

15:46.079 --> 15:49.049
I GOT OUT SAFE.
THERE'S NO FIRE.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.285
GOT A LOT OF GUTS
COMING AROUND HERE,
SHOWING YOUR FACE.

15:52.319 --> 15:53.120
Sean:
THAT'S RIGHT.

15:53.153 --> 15:56.056
YEAH, STILL GONNA
HAVE TO BUST YOU UP.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.190
WHAT?

15:57.224 --> 15:58.625
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU TWO?

15:58.658 --> 16:00.293
OH, COME ON. DON'T
PLAY ALL INNOCENT.
ALL RIGHT?

16:00.327 --> 16:02.129
WE KNOW WHAT YOU TWO
WERE UP TO.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.231
AND WHAT'S THAT?

16:07.600 --> 16:10.303
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, PAL!

16:12.405 --> 16:13.706
OK, WHERE ARE THEY?

16:13.740 --> 16:15.275
HEE HEE HEE!

16:15.308 --> 16:17.444
NO LAUGHING, PUNK!

16:17.477 --> 16:21.248
OH! OH, WHAT DO
WE HAVE HERE,
YOUNG MAN?

16:21.281 --> 16:22.382
HMM?

16:22.415 --> 16:23.383
I--I--

16:23.416 --> 16:24.584
WHAT ARE THOSE?

16:24.617 --> 16:27.754
THANK GOD
SHE DOESN'T KNOW.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.689
I KNOW WHAT THEY ARE!

16:29.722 --> 16:31.524
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT HE HAS THEM.

16:31.558 --> 16:34.494
I'M SORRY, LILY.
I WAS TRYING TO DO
THE RESPONSIBLE THING.

16:34.527 --> 16:37.097
I MEAN, WE NEEDED
PROTECTION.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.231
PROTECTION FROM WHAT?

16:38.265 --> 16:42.369
IN CASE OUR PASSIONS
GOT OUT OF CONTROL.

16:44.104 --> 16:44.704
OW!

16:44.737 --> 16:48.541
YEAH, LIKE THAT,
BUT NICE.

16:48.808 --> 16:51.711
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THAT THERE IS
"PASSION" BETWEEN US?

16:51.744 --> 16:54.714
LILY, WOMEN SEND SIGNALS,

16:54.747 --> 16:57.650
AND YOU'VE BEEN SENDING ME
SIGNALS FOR A LONG TIME.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.319
WHAT SIGNALS?

16:59.352 --> 17:02.722
YOU KNOW, LIKE EVEN
TONIGHT AT THE PARTY.

17:02.755 --> 17:05.292
HA HA HA!

17:53.306 --> 17:55.875
YOU HAD DIP
ON YOUR FACE.

17:55.908 --> 17:56.643
YEAH?

17:56.676 --> 17:58.545
I WAS TELLING YOU
TO WIPE IT OFF.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.780
THAT'S NOT A SIGNAL.

18:01.248 --> 18:03.850
HE'S A 15-YEAR-OLD BOY.
EVERYTHING'S A SIGNAL.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.318
YOU UNDERSTAND!

18:05.352 --> 18:06.119
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND,

18:06.153 --> 18:07.754
BUT YOU'RE STILL
GONNA GET BUSTED UP.

18:07.787 --> 18:11.424
BUT MR. FINNERTY EXPLAINED
ALL ABOUT SIGNALS.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.793
HE--HE SAID
YOU LIKED ME.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.496
YOU TALKED TO HIM?

18:16.529 --> 18:20.167
UH, UM, WELL, WE WERE
JUST--WE HAD A CHAT.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.234
ABOUT ME?

18:21.268 --> 18:22.335
UH, WELL, YOU KNOW,

18:22.369 --> 18:25.272
UH, UM, YOUR NAME
MIGHT HAVE COME UP.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.373
AAH!

18:26.406 --> 18:28.408
OH, COME ON, LILY!

18:28.441 --> 18:31.344
I WAS TRYING
TO BE HELPFUL!

18:31.378 --> 18:36.383
OH, MAN. THE OUIJA BOARD
WAS RIGHT.

18:38.251 --> 18:39.352
LILY.

18:39.386 --> 18:41.354
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU PEOPLE?

18:41.388 --> 18:42.422
IS SEX
ALL YOU EVER
THINK ABOUT?

18:42.455 --> 18:46.393
COME ON, YOU'RE--
NO, YOU'RE OUR DAUGHTER,
COME ON!

18:46.426 --> 18:48.795
YOU NEED
TO GET A HOBBY.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.898
DID YOU KNOW BRAD
HAD BOUGHT CONDOMS?
NO!

18:51.931 --> 18:54.401
WELL, THEN YOU DON'T KNOW
EVERYTHING, DO YOU?

18:54.434 --> 18:56.569
OH! BUT STILL,
I MEAN, IT'S BRAD, OK?

18:56.603 --> 18:57.437
I COULD TAKE HIM
TO THE PARK

18:57.470 --> 18:59.906
AND MAKE HIM CATCH
FRISBEES IN HIS MOUTH.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.374
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
LIKE A DOG, OK?

19:01.408 --> 19:02.475
AND LIKE A DOG,
YOU CAN BRING HIM HOME,

19:02.509 --> 19:06.879
AND HE'S GONNA TRY
TO GET ALL FRIENDLY
WITH YOUR LEG.

19:06.913 --> 19:07.914
EW.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.882
LOOK, LOOK,
ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT HE DIDN'T TRY

19:09.916 --> 19:11.351
TO PULL ANY MOVES
AT THIS PARTY?

19:11.384 --> 19:15.522
NO! I MEAN, WE BARELY
EVEN TALKED. WE--

19:17.390 --> 19:19.326
OH, GOD.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.528
HE IS SO LAME.

19:25.998 --> 19:29.236
SO, UH, WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO?

19:29.269 --> 19:31.871
YOU'RE HAVING
A PARTY, BRAD.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.840
I KIND OF WANT
TO DO THAT.

19:33.873 --> 19:36.243
R-RIGHT.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.445
R-REMEMBER
WHEN WE WERE KIDS?

19:38.478 --> 19:40.913
THAT COWBOY WALLPAPER
IN MY ROOM?

19:40.947 --> 19:43.416
YEAH?
IT'S DOWN.

19:43.450 --> 19:44.717
DON'T HAVE IT ANYMORE.

19:44.751 --> 19:45.952
GREAT!

19:45.985 --> 19:47.554
YEAH, IT'S BLUE NOW.

19:47.587 --> 19:51.391
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.
YOU LIKE BLUE.

19:51.424 --> 19:54.494
DEFINITELY!

19:54.527 --> 19:56.563
SO YOU WANT TO SEE IT?

19:56.596 --> 19:57.630
THE BLUE?

19:57.664 --> 19:59.532
YEAH, IF YOU WANT.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.601
NOW?
SURE!

20:01.634 --> 20:04.337
NO.

20:05.272 --> 20:07.807
YOU KNOW MY PARENTS
ARE GONE?

20:07.840 --> 20:09.008
SO?

20:09.041 --> 20:11.378
SO...

20:11.411 --> 20:12.912
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, BRAD?

20:12.945 --> 20:15.014
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

20:15.047 --> 20:18.585
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

20:19.386 --> 20:20.186
HEH HEH!

20:20.219 --> 20:23.022
SEE, I TOLD YOU!
HE HAD IT ON HIS MIND.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.090
BECAUSE
YOU PUT IT THERE.

20:24.123 --> 20:26.493
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
I MIGHT HAVE GIVEN HIM
SOME ADVICE,

20:26.526 --> 20:27.627
BUT I CERTAINLY
DIDN'T TELL HIM

20:27.660 --> 20:31.398
TO SUIT UP
FOR THE BIG GAME.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.566
OK, YOU TALKED
ABOUT ME WITH BRAD.

20:33.600 --> 20:37.370
YOU CALLED
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT
ON MY OUIJA GAME.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.306
IT'S SO HUMILIATING.

20:39.339 --> 20:40.840
BUT WE DO THINGS
LIKE THIS BECAUSE
WE'RE CONCERNED,

20:40.873 --> 20:43.476
AND WHEN
WE'RE CONCERNED
WE GET INVOLVED,

20:43.510 --> 20:46.513
AND THAT LEADS
TO HUMILIATION.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.014
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
A LOT OF PARENTS
DON'T CARE ENOUGH

20:48.047 --> 20:50.550
ABOUT THEIR KIDS
TO HUMILIATE THEM.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.452
BUT WE DO.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.988
MOM, DAD,
COULD YOU TRY LOVING ME

20:56.022 --> 20:58.591
WITHOUT CARING SO MUCH?

20:59.592 --> 21:00.793
WE'LL TRY.

21:00.827 --> 21:01.861
FOR YOU.

21:01.894 --> 21:04.431
THANK YOU.

21:05.665 --> 21:08.335
HEH HEH! SEE?

21:08.368 --> 21:09.302
MY STRATEGY WORKED.

21:09.336 --> 21:12.672
OH, YOU DID NOT
HAVE A STRATEGY.
YES, I DID.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.907
I GOT SOME STRATEGY.

21:16.676 --> 21:17.544
COME ON, LET'S GO.

21:17.577 --> 21:21.581
I'M SORRY.
I WASN'T REALLY
BEING MYSELF.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.983
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.685
IT'S JUST THAT...

21:25.718 --> 21:27.520
YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

21:27.554 --> 21:29.456
SERIOUSLY?

21:29.489 --> 21:30.557
YEAH.

21:30.590 --> 21:33.860
THAT'S
REALLY SWEET, BRAD.

21:40.533 --> 21:41.901
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

21:41.934 --> 21:43.603
YEAH.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.038
JUST A SECOND.

21:47.974 --> 21:50.009
YEAH!

21:50.042 --> 21:51.611
COME HERE,
YOU LITTLE--

21:51.644 --> 21:53.713
IF I GET
MY HANDS ON YOU--

21:53.746 --> 21:55.348
YOU BETTER RUN!

21:58.017 --> 21:58.685
YOU HAVE A SON
ABOUT THIS BIG,
BROWN HAIR?

21:58.718 --> 22:00.119
UH, YEAH, YEAH.
HE'S UPSTAIRS.

22:00.152 --> 22:03.322
NO, HE'S NOT.

22:07.093 --> 22:07.960
HEY, DAD!

22:07.994 --> 22:10.597
HENRY, YOU COME DOWN
FROM THERE
RIGHT NOW!

22:10.630 --> 22:12.632
FINE.

22:18.805 --> 22:20.006
PSYCH!

22:20.039 --> 22:20.740
HENRY!

22:20.773 --> 22:23.976
MY GOD, HE DOES
HAVE THE STUFF.
