TV NARRATOR:
<i>Meet the Jade Dragon Triad.</i>

00:10.117 --> 00:12.161
<i>They take no prisoners...</i>

00:12.202 --> 00:15.038
<i>because they are prisoners...</i>

00:15.080 --> 00:18.750
<i>at the Orange County</i>
<i>Correctional Facility L.I.T.E.</i>

00:18.792 --> 00:21.795
<i>They're the ruling gang</i>
<i>in this four-star hellhole,</i>

00:21.837 --> 00:24.465
<i>and the"Real</i>
<i>Asian Prison Housewives</i>

00:24.507 --> 00:25.966
<i>"of the Orange County</i>

00:26.008 --> 00:28.492
<i>White Collar Prison System."</i>

00:30.427 --> 00:33.055
NOH: <i>We are a gang;</i>
<i>we stick together.</i>

00:33.097 --> 00:34.890
Uh-huh. Although, right now,

00:34.932 --> 00:36.850
one of our members
is a real "B" word.

00:36.892 --> 00:40.146
We're getting ready to do
something about it.

00:40.187 --> 00:43.107
OLIVE: <i>She come in</i>
<i>and quickly become leader.</i>

00:43.149 --> 00:46.401
And we get so sick
of her bossy, bossy behavior,

00:46.443 --> 00:48.112
and now she got to go.

00:48.154 --> 00:51.448
In civilian life,
we'd just vote Lu out,

00:51.490 --> 00:55.661
but here... she's gonna end up
on the wrong end of a noodle.

00:55.702 --> 00:57.830
<i>Uncooked.</i>

00:57.871 --> 01:00.040
<i>You get me?</i>

01:00.082 --> 01:01.792
LUCILLE:
<i>Ignore them.</i>

01:01.834 --> 01:04.837
Their bark is louder than
the dogs they eat back home.

01:04.878 --> 01:06.797
And I got news for them.

01:06.839 --> 01:08.423
Anyone who comes after me

01:08.465 --> 01:11.760
is going to be
one unfortunate cookie.

01:11.802 --> 01:13.553
(laughs)

01:13.595 --> 01:15.973
I made a pun.

01:16.015 --> 01:17.724
(sighs)

01:17.766 --> 01:19.935
NARRATOR: <i>Now the story</i>
<i>of a family</i>

01:19.977 --> 01:21.854
<i>whose future was</i>
<i>abruptly cancelled,</i>

01:21.895 --> 01:24.272
<i>and the one mother</i>
<i>who had no choice</i>

01:24.314 --> 01:26.358
<i>but to keep herself together.</i>

01:30.821 --> 01:33.406
<i>It's Lucille's</i>
"Arrested Development."

01:35.534 --> 01:37.953
NARRATOR: <i>Years before</i>
<i>her behavior had become</i>

01:37.995 --> 01:40.914
<i>"bossy, bossy"</i>
<i>with the Jade Dragon Triad...</i>

01:42.875 --> 01:45.669
<i>Lucille was fleeing the SEC...</i>

01:45.711 --> 01:47.546
Full steam, boys!

01:47.587 --> 01:49.048
- (cell phone ringing)
- (clamoring outside)

01:49.089 --> 01:51.466
<i>...when she got a call.</i>

01:51.508 --> 01:53.177
Hello, Lucille.

01:53.219 --> 01:55.470
I still hope you're coming
to our little get-together.

01:55.512 --> 01:57.556
You want to hear
something funny?

01:57.597 --> 01:59.808
I never got an invitation!

01:59.850 --> 02:02.936
But I feel like I'm there,
because it's all over the news.

02:02.978 --> 02:05.272
- (siren whooping)
- Oh, honey, is that you?

02:05.313 --> 02:06.940
I'm on my deck waving to you.

02:06.982 --> 02:08.400
But with those police boats
following you,

02:08.441 --> 02:10.485
I guess I'm waving good-bye.

02:10.526 --> 02:12.905
You must be mistaken,
because I can't see you,

02:12.946 --> 02:14.740
and you're usually
as hard to miss

02:14.781 --> 02:16.533
as Liberace
wearing a fright wig.

02:16.575 --> 02:18.869
(over phone):
Oh, goodness, that is you!

02:18.911 --> 02:21.663
I'm practically
counting your crow's feet.

02:21.705 --> 02:23.456
Oh, well,
maybe I should turn back

02:23.498 --> 02:25.125
- and show you another bird.
- (line disconnects)

02:25.167 --> 02:26.919
Hel-Hello?

02:26.960 --> 02:28.879
Did you hear me say that
about the bird? Hello?!

02:28.921 --> 02:32.216
<i>But it was clear that Lucille 2</i>
<i>hadn't heard it.</i>

02:32.258 --> 02:34.968
<i>So, in a fit of</i>
<i>what sailors call "sea rage..."</i>

02:35.010 --> 02:36.511
Coming about.

02:36.553 --> 02:38.138
<i>...she turned back</i>
<i>to show her the bird.</i>

02:38.180 --> 02:40.266
Coming about, boys!

02:40.307 --> 02:42.142
<i>But Lucille 2</i>
<i>wasn't the only thing</i>

02:42.184 --> 02:44.061
<i>that got flipped that day.</i>

02:44.103 --> 02:45.645
JOHN BEARD: ...none of which
would've happened

02:45.687 --> 02:47.480
if it had continued out to sea.

02:47.522 --> 02:50.192
But then the "Queen" changed
course, heading back to shore,

02:50.234 --> 02:53.112
before crashing into the jetty
in what can only be described

02:53.153 --> 02:55.906
as a "sail-past" gone wrong.

02:55.948 --> 02:58.242
<i>And that's when they got</i>
<i>some good news from Barry.</i>

02:58.284 --> 03:00.368
BARRY: First of all,
won't be cheap.

03:00.410 --> 03:02.579
It's gonna cost you a fortune
in legal fees.

03:02.621 --> 03:04.414
What's the good news?

03:04.456 --> 03:06.541
<i>Correction:</i>
<i>good news for Barry.</i>

03:06.583 --> 03:08.168
It's all bad news.

03:08.210 --> 03:10.503
<i>Although, he did have</i>
<i>one good suggestion:</i>

03:10.545 --> 03:11.713
...you're going away
for a long time,

03:11.755 --> 03:13.132
unless we can come up
with a good alibi.

03:13.173 --> 03:16.343
Ma! I fell in the ocean;
why didn't you come for me?

03:16.384 --> 03:17.677
And there it is.

03:17.719 --> 03:18.678
- What?
- I did.

03:18.720 --> 03:19.972
- Buster...
- What?

03:20.013 --> 03:21.389
...tell them
how you were drowning

03:21.431 --> 03:23.016
and I commandeered the ship
to save you.

03:23.058 --> 03:24.184
Tell them what I did.

03:25.393 --> 03:27.146
- The truth.
- Okay.

03:27.187 --> 03:29.982
She stole the "Queen Mary"
to get away from the SEC.

03:30.023 --> 03:31.942
Oh, and she winked.

03:31.984 --> 03:35.321
Correction: it's a glare.
(chuckles)

03:35.362 --> 03:36.446
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Oh, God.

03:36.488 --> 03:37.489
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

03:37.530 --> 03:38.657
Wait, wh-where you going?

03:38.698 --> 03:40.033
Wait, she doesn't
have her make--

03:40.075 --> 03:41.409
I have her lipstick!

03:41.451 --> 03:43.162
<i>But Buster knew that lipstick</i>

03:43.203 --> 03:45.831
<i>wasn't the only thing</i>
<i>she'd be without.</i>

03:45.872 --> 03:50.669
<i>So, after she was released to</i>
<i>await trial under house arrest,</i>

03:50.710 --> 03:54.256
<i>he made sure she was able</i>
<i>to catch up on what she missed.</i>

03:54.298 --> 03:56.549
This is the same scene
I came back to

03:56.591 --> 03:59.345
after Cancun four years ago.

03:59.386 --> 04:03.431
<i>And after devising their plan</i>
<i>to build the wall,</i>

04:03.473 --> 04:06.559
<i>it was decided that</i>
<i>George Sr. should move out,</i>

04:06.601 --> 04:09.604
<i>in order to make</i>
<i>their fake divorce look real.</i>

04:09.646 --> 04:11.606
After the trial,
you can move back in.

04:11.648 --> 04:14.276
It's only a trial separation.

04:14.318 --> 04:16.569
(laughs):
I made a pun.

04:16.611 --> 04:17.570
(chuckles)

04:17.612 --> 04:19.781
Even in this time of stress.

04:19.822 --> 04:22.242
You think you're gonna be okay,
alone with Buster?

04:22.284 --> 04:24.494
If I need a moment to myself,
I'll step out on the balcony.

04:24.536 --> 04:26.205
Your ankle bracelet--
it's gonna go off.

04:26.246 --> 04:27.998
So I'll make him
stand on the balcony.

04:28.040 --> 04:30.000
He's happiest
when he feels useful.

04:30.042 --> 04:32.502
<i>Soon, he was</i>
<i>practically delirious.</i>

04:35.881 --> 04:36.923
(Buster sobs)

04:36.965 --> 04:38.842
<i>There was one bright spot</i>

04:38.884 --> 04:40.844
<i>when they simultaneously</i>
<i>stumbled on a term</i>

04:40.886 --> 04:43.013
<i>they both secretly</i>
<i>recognized...</i>

04:43.055 --> 04:44.973
MAN (on TV): ...take this
hot mess of a skirt...

04:45.015 --> 04:47.767
<i>...would be useful</i>
<i>in their future disagreements.</i>

04:47.809 --> 04:49.978
(mouthing)

04:50.020 --> 04:51.397
MAN (on TV): ...I'm covered
with glue and I'm, like...

04:51.438 --> 04:53.899
this is a hot mess!

04:53.940 --> 04:55.483
(mouthing)

04:55.525 --> 04:58.904
<i>But as her trial grew closer,</i>
<i>it was getting harder</i>

04:58.945 --> 05:02.408
<i>for Lucille</i>
<i>not to alienate her alibi.</i>

05:02.449 --> 05:05.160
This toast has hook holes...

05:05.202 --> 05:08.330
...again! I told you to get rid
of that thing; it's hideous.

05:08.372 --> 05:10.832
Plus, what's gonna happen
when they swear you in?

05:10.874 --> 05:12.918
You're gonna
rip the Bible in half.

05:12.959 --> 05:14.253
The jury will love that.

05:14.294 --> 05:17.547
You're getting pretty snippy

05:17.589 --> 05:19.216
to your key witness, aren't you?

05:19.258 --> 05:20.717
What do you want?

05:20.759 --> 05:24.430
Maybe you could hook me up
with a little stimmy.

05:26.306 --> 05:28.516
Lil' stimmy.

05:28.558 --> 05:29.642
Are you trying to do this?

05:29.684 --> 05:31.228
Yes!

05:31.270 --> 05:33.272
And I want stimmy
to get a hook that'll do that.

05:33.313 --> 05:35.065
<i>When no such hook</i>
<i>was available,</i>

05:35.107 --> 05:38.777
<i>Lucille found other means</i>
<i>to mollify her alibi--</i>

05:38.818 --> 05:41.238
<i>both of which were unveiled</i>
<i>at a family meeting.</i>

05:41.280 --> 05:44.366
...you're the key witness
in your mother's trial.

05:44.408 --> 05:46.076
Wait, I thought
I was the key witness.

05:46.118 --> 05:47.702
- You're the star witness.
- Oh.

05:47.744 --> 05:50.580
Because it was your life
I was going after to save.

05:50.622 --> 05:52.082
He fell off the boat.

05:52.124 --> 05:54.084
- He'll tell you in my own words.
- (groans)

05:54.126 --> 05:55.585
(mumbles):
Homosexuals kidnapped...

05:55.627 --> 05:58.046
Up-up-up.

05:58.716 --> 06:00.340
(loudly):
Homosexuals kidnapped the boat

06:00.399 --> 06:02.151
and took it on a joy ride.

06:02.193 --> 06:03.986
Mother didn't want to trample
their rights, so she let them.

06:04.028 --> 06:05.571
Then she realized
that her son fell

06:05.613 --> 06:07.948
off the boat and into the water,
and she went back.

06:07.990 --> 06:09.825
Oh, and a fish swam by my ankle.

06:09.867 --> 06:11.536
(gasps)
That really happened.

06:11.577 --> 06:12.704
Should I keep that?

06:12.745 --> 06:14.079
- Make it an eel.
- Okay.

06:14.121 --> 06:16.040
- It's gonna be an eel!
- Better.

06:16.081 --> 06:19.126
<i>But alone with Buster,</i>
<i>the tension grew worse,</i>

06:19.168 --> 06:22.921
<i>and things came to a head</i>
<i>the night before the trial.</i>

06:22.963 --> 06:24.507
Buster, I'm going to exhale!

06:24.549 --> 06:26.133
No, please!

06:26.175 --> 06:28.927
I've had, like, seven
in the past half hour.

06:28.969 --> 06:31.556
You're not the one
staring five years in the face.

06:31.597 --> 06:34.517
Well, right now, I'm staring at
a hundred years in the face!

06:34.559 --> 06:36.352
(whispers):
How dare you.

06:36.394 --> 06:39.731
Would you mind?

06:39.772 --> 06:41.940
Be careful, defendant.

06:41.982 --> 06:44.818
Remember who you're talking to.

06:44.860 --> 06:47.071
It sure would be a shame
if something happened

06:47.112 --> 06:49.490
to your pretty little
key witness.

06:49.532 --> 06:51.659
Star witness.

06:51.701 --> 06:53.827
And are you
threatening yourself?

06:53.869 --> 06:55.371
Maybe I am.

06:55.413 --> 06:59.584
<i>And losing confidence</i>
<i>in her star witness,</i>

06:59.625 --> 07:01.835
<i>Lucille decided to take</i>
<i>a few keepsakes with her,</i>

07:01.877 --> 07:05.715
<i>in case things didn't</i>
<i>go her way.</i>

07:06.882 --> 07:08.509
<i>And that's when she discovered</i>

07:08.551 --> 07:10.844
<i>that the family</i>
<i>she believed supported her</i>

07:10.886 --> 07:13.723
<i>had actually already begun</i>
<i>divvying up her stuff,</i>

07:13.765 --> 07:14.932
<i>in case she lost.</i>

07:17.226 --> 07:18.519
Aw...

07:18.561 --> 07:20.813
And he's supposed to be
the good one.

07:20.854 --> 07:23.733
This does not bode well
for tomorrow.

07:23.775 --> 07:26.485
<i>Actually, they'd claimed</i>
<i>those things years earlier</i>

07:26.527 --> 07:29.280
<i>when she was having</i>
<i>a sunspot checked.</i>

07:29.321 --> 07:30.782
<i>But she was right</i>
<i>to worry about</i>

07:30.823 --> 07:32.408
<i>the turnout for the trial.</i>

07:32.450 --> 07:35.327
Does the defense have a witness
they'd like to call?!

07:35.369 --> 07:36.912
Any witness?

07:36.954 --> 07:38.997
Please tell me you're working on
a strategy for us.

07:39.039 --> 07:41.166
Oh. It's us now?

07:41.208 --> 07:43.502
Well, we have Lucille Austero.

07:43.544 --> 07:44.878
She's the only one who showed.

07:44.920 --> 07:46.922
I don't think
that is good for us.

07:46.964 --> 07:48.090
Nonsense.

07:48.132 --> 07:49.592
- She owns the company now.
- Mm-hmm.

07:49.634 --> 07:51.719
She's got as much to lose
as I do.

07:51.761 --> 07:53.471
And she's a dear friend.

07:53.512 --> 07:55.055
I'll do it myself though.

07:55.097 --> 07:56.641
I need this to go well.

07:56.682 --> 07:59.769
<i>And so it was Lucille</i>
<i>who did the questioning</i>

07:59.811 --> 08:02.480
<i>of her new star witness,</i>
<i>Lucille 2.</i>

08:02.521 --> 08:04.940
Thank you so much
for coming to be my witness.

08:04.982 --> 08:07.192
You're such
a large shareholder...

08:07.234 --> 08:08.778
Oh...

08:08.820 --> 08:10.529
(chuckles):
I've made a pun.

08:10.571 --> 08:13.741
Oh, how could I not do it
for my oldest friend?

08:13.783 --> 08:14.950
Oh!

08:14.992 --> 08:17.161
Now I've gone and done a double.

08:17.202 --> 08:18.454
(laughs):
A double.

08:18.496 --> 08:20.164
Like your pre-surgery chin.

08:20.205 --> 08:21.749
Or your post-breakfast drink.

08:21.791 --> 08:24.918
Oh, I wish you'd come
to my rehab clinic.

08:24.960 --> 08:28.046
But anything to help that
Keystone Cop family of yours.

08:28.088 --> 08:29.507
Keystone Cops.

08:29.548 --> 08:31.843
Your references are as fresh
as the wallpaper

08:31.884 --> 08:33.719
in the room
of that pretend child

08:33.760 --> 08:35.596
you've had all these years.

08:35.638 --> 08:37.717
- But, my friend...
- You're right, I shouldn't joke.

08:37.722 --> 08:40.392
None of your family showed up,
you poor thing.

08:40.433 --> 08:42.977
This is such a black mark
on all of you.

08:43.020 --> 08:44.897
You should know
about black marks.

08:44.938 --> 08:47.191
Your pillow must look like
a Rorschach test.

08:47.232 --> 08:49.819
(chuckles): Not that there'd be
anyone to see it.

08:49.861 --> 08:51.612
So, as I was saying...

08:51.654 --> 08:53.071
<i>But unfortunately,</i>

08:53.113 --> 08:55.491
<i>their 30-year</i>
<i>passive-aggressive dance</i>

08:55.533 --> 08:57.242
<i>was losing some of its passive.</i>

08:57.284 --> 08:59.286
As if everybody in this room
couldn't tell

08:59.328 --> 09:03.040
how jealous and conniving you
are, my dear Lucille Austero.

09:03.081 --> 09:06.836
What I knew was that you were
stealing for years-- we all did!

09:06.878 --> 09:09.672
That's why nobody was surprised
when you stole that boat.

09:09.714 --> 09:11.131
And I knew you couldn't wait

09:11.173 --> 09:13.718
to get your liver-spotted claws
into my company!

09:13.759 --> 09:15.969
Says the woman whose liver
can be spotted from outer space.

09:16.011 --> 09:18.263
- No further questions!
- No further answers!

09:18.305 --> 09:19.640
Am I done?

09:19.682 --> 09:23.561
Oh, that's got to be
a treasure chest.

09:23.602 --> 09:24.729
You think that went well?

09:24.770 --> 09:26.814
BARRY:
I do.

09:26.856 --> 09:29.734
<i>The judge kept Lucille on ice</i>
<i>while she awaited the verdict.</i>

09:29.775 --> 09:31.485
Have you heard anything?

09:31.527 --> 09:35.155
Well, our cashier's pregnant,
and she's not married, so...

09:35.197 --> 09:36.448
I mean about me.

09:36.490 --> 09:38.534
Oh, you're guilty--
three to five.

09:40.000 --> 09:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here

09:47.543 --> 09:49.962
<i>Lucille was</i>
<i>checking in to her new home.</i>

09:50.003 --> 09:53.090
Hello! Oh, Mrs. Bluth is here,
for stealing the "Queen Mary."

09:53.131 --> 09:56.093
- We're so glad to have you here.
<i>- It was one of the so-called</i>

09:56.134 --> 09:57.055
<i>country club prisons...</i>

09:57.094 --> 09:59.263
So... you are here.

09:59.304 --> 10:02.015
<i>...that had become popular</i>
<i>after the Enron debacle.</i>

10:02.057 --> 10:03.434
...so you're gonna take
this hallway to the elevators,

10:03.475 --> 10:04.727
and then you're gonna
want to go...

10:04.769 --> 10:06.228
Slow down.

10:06.270 --> 10:08.188
You sound like the end
of a Cymbalta commercial.

10:08.230 --> 10:10.399
Even the lifers get confused.
Don't worry...

10:10.441 --> 10:13.193
<i>Even though it was a nice</i>
<i>prison, it was still prison.</i>

10:13.235 --> 10:14.570
...your choice of
fresh scent, sport,

10:14.612 --> 10:16.196
or floral for your delousing.

10:16.238 --> 10:18.741
Also, if you're
sexually assaulted by a guard...

10:18.783 --> 10:21.410
A $20 gratuity is appreciated?

10:21.452 --> 10:22.661
(laughs)

10:22.703 --> 10:25.038
No, but press seven
on your phone.

10:25.080 --> 10:27.792
If you go through the front
desk, it'll take forever.

10:27.833 --> 10:31.003
<i>After Lucille got settled in,</i>
<i>she received a visitor.</i>

10:31.044 --> 10:32.296
LUCILLE:
You missed my trial, George.

10:32.337 --> 10:33.505
How could you?

10:33.547 --> 10:35.215
GEORGE SR:
I told you I was sorry.

10:35.257 --> 10:37.009
I was unconscious
on the sweat lodge floor.

10:37.050 --> 10:38.051
I lost two days.

10:38.093 --> 10:39.637
I'm losing three to five years.

10:39.678 --> 10:41.931
And those are the last years,
George, the best years,

10:41.973 --> 10:44.266
where you can have sex and not
worry about getting pregnant.

10:44.308 --> 10:45.601
All right, here's the good news:

10:45.643 --> 10:47.269
they only got you
on stealing the boat.

10:47.311 --> 10:49.313
They didn't even touch us
on the financial stuff.

10:49.354 --> 10:51.398
- You're gonna get out of here.
- When?

10:51.440 --> 10:53.800
Better be before the money runs
out; this place isn't cheap.

10:53.818 --> 10:56.904
I know, and you are
running up those spa bills.

10:56.946 --> 11:00.032
The same girl who hands me
towels does the cavity checks.

11:00.073 --> 11:01.492
You tip.

11:01.533 --> 11:03.828
Barry says he can get your
sentence reduced if...

11:03.869 --> 11:07.289
you agree to leave here
and go to Lucille 2's

11:07.331 --> 11:08.791
rehab clinic.

11:08.833 --> 11:11.543
That's the bitch
that put me here.

11:11.585 --> 11:14.630
And I'm not gonna fake having
some sort of...

11:14.672 --> 11:16.256
I don't know-- alcohol problem--

11:16.298 --> 11:18.843
just so that sterile cuckoo bird
can laugh at me.

11:18.884 --> 11:20.427
I figured. Okay.

11:20.469 --> 11:23.180
I have another idea--
now, you know China Garden?

11:23.221 --> 11:24.473
I know the one by the harbor.

11:24.515 --> 11:25.516
No, this one's a person.

11:25.557 --> 11:26.725
And that one closed.

11:26.767 --> 11:29.186
China Garden's Aunt Olive

11:29.227 --> 11:31.730
is very well connected
with the Jade Triad Gang.

11:31.772 --> 11:32.982
It's a prison gang here.

11:33.024 --> 11:34.900
And believe me,
they will protect you.

11:34.942 --> 11:36.986
That's a gang?

11:37.028 --> 11:40.072
I thought they were
tech support.

11:40.113 --> 11:41.824
<i>It turned out they were a gang.</i>

11:41.866 --> 11:44.035
<i>And thanks to China Garden,</i>

11:44.076 --> 11:46.286
<i>Lucille was admitted</i>
<i>as a probationary member.</i>

11:46.328 --> 11:47.913
You play mahjong before?

11:47.955 --> 11:50.123
Our beach club used
to have a Jewish Day.

11:50.165 --> 11:51.208
Your move, Olive Garden.

11:51.249 --> 11:52.835
I can't concentrate.

11:52.877 --> 11:55.212
Playing mahjong
without cigarette is like

11:55.253 --> 11:57.297
playing video poker without...

11:57.339 --> 11:58.340
cigarette.

11:58.382 --> 12:00.258
Why are we not allowed to smoke

12:00.300 --> 12:01.844
in this stupid prison?

12:01.886 --> 12:04.763
<i>And that's</i>
<i>when Lucille made her move.</i>

12:04.805 --> 12:07.683
- I know a loophole.
- Huh?

12:07.725 --> 12:08.893
"Roop hore"?

12:08.934 --> 12:10.728
- Roop hore.
- Roop hore.

12:10.769 --> 12:12.897
<i>It was a loophole</i>
<i>that would get Lucille</i>

12:12.938 --> 12:15.273
<i>accepted as</i>
<i>a full-fledged member</i>

12:15.315 --> 12:17.943
<i>member of</i>
<i>the Jade Dragon Triad.</i>

12:17.985 --> 12:19.786
You couldn't have chosen
a harder word to say.

12:22.155 --> 12:24.658
<i>And soon</i>
<i>the Dragons were taking</i>

12:24.700 --> 12:26.744
<i>"drags on"</i>
<i>their cigarettes again.</i>

12:26.785 --> 12:28.829
There's always a way
to get what you want.

12:28.871 --> 12:32.917
My husband is a very
powerful man, Lucille Bluth.

12:32.958 --> 12:36.003
Perhaps we can help each other
get what we want.

12:36.045 --> 12:39.423
<i>And that's how Lucille found</i>
<i>a deep-pocketed investor</i>

12:39.464 --> 12:41.174
<i>to help build the wall.</i>

12:41.216 --> 12:44.845
I got Olive Garden
to offer us unlimited bread.

12:44.887 --> 12:47.890
Who better than the Chinese
to help us build a wall, right?

12:47.932 --> 12:50.851
So the Chinese will own
a piece of the wall

12:50.893 --> 12:52.227
between U.S. and Mexico?

12:52.269 --> 12:53.979
They'll own all of it,
but they'll make us

12:54.021 --> 12:56.023
very rich in the process.

12:56.065 --> 12:58.650
We just need to get Michael
to sign a release.

12:58.692 --> 13:00.569
He sold his shares,
but he could still claim

13:00.611 --> 13:01.862
that he deserves a piece.

13:01.904 --> 13:04.489
Or worse, find out
and blow the whistle.

13:04.531 --> 13:06.450
Where the hell did we go wrong
with that kid?

13:06.491 --> 13:09.202
Probably where we went wrong
with the others-- I don't know.

13:09.244 --> 13:12.123
I like the plan... I just wonder

13:12.164 --> 13:14.625
if we're not in that
treason-adjacent place

13:14.666 --> 13:17.086
where the, uh,
government will retaliate

13:17.128 --> 13:19.004
and, uh... execute us.

13:19.046 --> 13:21.882
LUCILLE: Oh, they'd never
execute a woman for this.

13:21.924 --> 13:24.322
I have a good feeling
about these people.

13:24.442 --> 13:26.637
Oh, that's good enough for me.

13:26.678 --> 13:28.346
- (George crying)
<i>- But the change in the economy</i>

13:28.388 --> 13:31.809
<i>led the government to put</i>
<i>the wall project on hold.</i>

13:31.850 --> 13:33.185
<i>And as the months passed</i>

13:33.226 --> 13:35.687
<i>and the Chinese saw</i>
<i>no progress on the wall,</i>

13:35.729 --> 13:37.106
<i>tension mounted.</i>

13:37.148 --> 13:39.942
<i>And Lucille was getting</i>
<i>more controlling.</i>

13:39.984 --> 13:41.110
She said you're fat.

13:41.152 --> 13:42.861
That's what you said, right?

13:42.903 --> 13:44.155
Or does that mean something

13:44.196 --> 13:46.445
- different in Chinese?
- No, it means "fat."

13:46.565 --> 13:48.659
You keep causing trouble,
you're going to end up

13:48.700 --> 13:51.203
- with noodles in your belly.
- I like noodles.

13:51.244 --> 13:54.123
Not this way--
very hard to digest.

13:54.165 --> 13:55.791
Ancient Chinese secret, huh?

13:55.833 --> 13:57.626
It's no secret--
we'll kill you.

13:57.668 --> 13:59.711
<i>- She was even being controlling</i>
- Did you get that?

13:59.753 --> 14:01.964
<i>of the"R.A.P.H.O.C.W.C.P.S."</i>

14:02.006 --> 14:03.674
<i>reality TV crew.</i>

14:03.715 --> 14:05.425
Do you need a clean of
her making the threat?

14:05.467 --> 14:07.011
I can lean back,
but you will come around

14:07.052 --> 14:08.637
and get my reaction, yes?

14:08.679 --> 14:11.056
Oh, I'll say it again--
we'll kill you.

14:11.098 --> 14:13.391
<i>But soon</i>
<i>the threat was made real.</i>

14:13.433 --> 14:14.558
Oh!
She's got a sharpened noodle!

14:14.689 --> 14:16.483
She's trying to noodle-stab me!

14:16.524 --> 14:17.984
- Back up!
- (people screaming)

14:18.025 --> 14:19.110
(yells)

14:20.194 --> 14:22.363
- (grunts)
- (people yelling)

14:22.405 --> 14:23.615
(blows)

14:23.657 --> 14:25.492
Aah, my eye!

14:25.533 --> 14:27.952
This will be even more
exciting if you jump cut it.

14:27.994 --> 14:29.663
Quiet!

14:29.704 --> 14:34.125
You can't just come in and have
bread for nothing around here.

14:34.167 --> 14:36.753
You have to pay bill some time.

14:36.795 --> 14:39.589
<i>It wasn't a great time to find</i>
<i>out George didn't own</i>

14:39.631 --> 14:42.592
<i>the right property</i>
<i>to build the wall on.</i>

14:42.634 --> 14:45.386
<i>- And so a new plan emerged</i>
- LUCILLE: Make sure Hebert Love

14:45.428 --> 14:47.096
comes out against the wall...

14:47.138 --> 14:50.684
<i>They needed the government</i>
<i>to kill the wall completely,</i>

14:50.725 --> 14:52.477
<i>- but pay them anyway.</i>
- As much as I'd like to stay

14:52.519 --> 14:53.645
and lay some more pipe with you,

14:53.687 --> 14:55.438
I better get moving
on this thing.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.231
We've got to make
this wall work, George.

14:57.273 --> 14:58.900
We know Lucille 2
will oppose it,

14:58.941 --> 15:01.277
we just have make sure
Herbert Love does.

15:01.318 --> 15:03.111
Oh, don't worry-- that's
why I asked Michael for help.

15:03.154 --> 15:06.574
Michael? What are you bringing
Michael into this for?

15:06.616 --> 15:08.618
The only thing he should
be doing is signing over

15:08.660 --> 15:09.744
his rights to the company.

15:09.786 --> 15:11.287
I asked him to do this as well.

15:11.329 --> 15:12.497
<i>He made it a condition</i>
<i>of the now</i>

15:12.539 --> 15:14.457
<i>four favor family pact.</i>

15:14.499 --> 15:15.709
Will you please relax?

15:15.750 --> 15:16.671
...do something for me?

15:16.710 --> 15:18.545
You know,
your mother is very hurt.

15:18.586 --> 15:20.672
You haven't visited her.
It's like you have given up

15:20.714 --> 15:22.256
- on the family business.
- I have.

15:22.298 --> 15:24.050
Yes, but not in writing.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.844
To protect all of us, visit her,

15:25.886 --> 15:28.137
sign a little something
saying it's all hers.

15:28.179 --> 15:29.472
- Will you do this, Michael?
- Yeah.

15:29.514 --> 15:30.557
But I get to make you look bad

15:30.598 --> 15:31.850
- in the movie, okay?
- Okay.

15:31.892 --> 15:32.934
- Should we settle up?
- All right.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.477
Who owes what-what to who?

15:34.519 --> 15:35.854
LUCILLE: <i>Send me some evidence</i>
<i>of a wall</i>

15:35.896 --> 15:37.397
<i>I can show the Chinese.</i>

15:37.438 --> 15:38.565
And the government.

15:38.606 --> 15:40.901
We need to make
this happen, George.

15:40.942 --> 15:42.944
The Chinese have more
than a sharpened noodle

15:42.985 --> 15:44.612
with my name on it.

15:44.654 --> 15:46.698
NARRATOR: <i>And days later,</i>
<i>that evidence arrived</i>

15:46.740 --> 15:48.115
<i>from George Sr.</i>

15:48.157 --> 15:49.659
We've built this wall.

15:49.701 --> 15:51.411
We have miles and...

15:51.452 --> 15:54.581
and miles of wall, uh...

15:54.622 --> 16:00.879
(audio fast-fowarding)

16:00.921 --> 16:03.381
- There's more wall, uh...
- Dad! Dad...!

16:03.423 --> 16:06.092
- And you know, and it feels good to help,
- It's spinning!

16:06.133 --> 16:07.802
to protecting our-our border.

16:07.844 --> 16:09.679
LUCILLE: My God,
he Steamboat Willied it.

16:09.721 --> 16:11.765
- It's a heart project.
- Dad! Dad!

16:11.806 --> 16:13.182
We love America.

16:13.224 --> 16:15.810
- We love America.
- Daddy!

16:15.852 --> 16:18.855
(sighs)

16:18.897 --> 16:22.483
<i>And that's when Lucille noticed</i>
<i>something worrisome.</i>

16:24.151 --> 16:27.113
<i>It seemed her prison family</i>
<i>was preparing</i>

16:27.154 --> 16:30.784
<i>for her to disappear as well.</i>

16:36.456 --> 16:39.667
<i>So Lucille took matters</i>
<i>into her own hands.</i>

16:41.878 --> 16:43.922
GOB: Well, that was fast,
you hot little...

16:43.964 --> 16:46.424
- It's your mother. - Hi, sorry, I
thought you were somebody else.

16:46.466 --> 16:48.092
I can't tell you who, 'cause
I'm-I'm dating someone famous.

16:48.134 --> 16:49.552
someone... famous.

16:49.594 --> 16:51.554
You better start to build
this wall built pronto.

16:51.596 --> 16:54.015
I tried with your father,
but he can't do it.

16:54.056 --> 16:55.934
Well, I'm kind of busy now--
I'm working with Michael.

16:55.976 --> 16:57.978
What are you working on
with Michael?

16:58.019 --> 16:59.646
Dad made him give me a job.

16:59.687 --> 17:01.063
I see--
so he thought it was

17:01.105 --> 17:03.399
a good idea
to have you two together.

17:03.441 --> 17:04.901
Isn't that nice?

17:04.943 --> 17:07.444
My God, is there anyone there
with half a brain

17:07.487 --> 17:08.695
that can help me with this?

17:08.738 --> 17:09.990
I don't know about
"half a brain,"

17:10.031 --> 17:11.531
but Tobias is living
with me right now

17:11.574 --> 17:13.159
and he's not very bright.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.244
Although he is working in
the rehab where Lucille 2 is.

17:16.287 --> 17:17.664
He is?

17:17.704 --> 17:19.205
<i>And that's when Lucille came up</i>

17:19.248 --> 17:20.875
<i>with a plan</i>
<i>to get transferred away</i>

17:20.916 --> 17:22.335
<i>from the Jade Dragon Triad.</i>

17:22.376 --> 17:23.920
Hire a crew and start the wall.

17:23.962 --> 17:25.421
And not a word to your brother.

17:25.463 --> 17:26.923
I'm getting a transfer.

17:26.964 --> 17:29.676
It's time for Mama to put on
the old drunk act.

17:29.717 --> 17:31.385
GOB:
That was an a...?

17:34.138 --> 17:36.057
<i>After a call</i>
<i>to Lucille 2's rehab center,</i>

17:36.098 --> 17:37.809
- (slurring): Lucille 2, please.
<i>- where her drunk act was</i>

17:37.851 --> 17:40.353
<i>as good as you'd see</i>
<i>at the Method One Clinic...</i>

17:40.394 --> 17:42.022
Fine, Lucille Austero.

17:42.063 --> 17:43.982
<i>...Lucille was admitted</i>
<i>as a patient.</i>

17:44.024 --> 17:45.316
<i>And soon met the therapist</i>

17:45.358 --> 17:46.108
<i>who held the keys to her</i>
<i>freedom.</i>

17:46.150 --> 17:47.276
You look great.

17:47.318 --> 17:48.987
That suit looks
very hetero on you.

17:49.029 --> 17:51.865
Well, thank you--
you look very hetero as well.

17:51.906 --> 17:55.201
Now... how are you?

17:55.242 --> 17:56.828
I'm as normal as blueberry pie.

17:56.870 --> 17:59.080
So write that down on a form,
sign me out,

17:59.121 --> 18:01.415
I won't have
to go back to prison,

18:01.457 --> 18:05.252
and maybe you'll find a new car
parked in your driveway.

18:07.213 --> 18:08.631
Oh...

18:08.673 --> 18:10.842
Yes, well,
it-it doesn't work that way.

18:10.884 --> 18:13.678
We have to have a series
of sessions, and, uh, I have to

18:13.720 --> 18:16.180
swear in the best
of my professional opinion

18:16.222 --> 18:18.558
that you have accepted
and made every effort

18:18.599 --> 18:21.310
at thoughtfully reflecting
upon your weaknesses.

18:21.352 --> 18:23.354
Yes!
Write down that I did that.

18:23.396 --> 18:25.023
Well, no,
I-I don't work that way.

18:25.065 --> 18:26.399
You don't work any way.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.192
This is your first paying job
in ten years.

18:28.234 --> 18:29.569
Oh, no, no, this doesn't pay.

18:29.610 --> 18:31.404
This is part of a
work release program.

18:31.445 --> 18:33.606
The state of California thinks
that I'm a sex offender.

18:33.614 --> 18:36.283
D-D-Don't worry about what
the state of California thinks.

18:36.325 --> 18:37.994
The point is we have a chance

18:38.036 --> 18:39.620
to be honest with ourselves.

18:39.662 --> 18:42.540
Fine-- you don't look
heterosexual in that suit.

18:42.582 --> 18:44.918
You look as swishy
as Ryan Seacrest.

18:44.959 --> 18:46.753
Ryan Seacrest is straight.

18:46.794 --> 18:48.880
And I'm 40!
Sign the form.

18:48.922 --> 18:51.049
Well, at least we have
a dialogue going.

18:51.091 --> 18:52.550
Dialogue?

18:52.592 --> 18:54.594
If you don't release me
you've heard the last

18:54.635 --> 18:56.554
I'm going to say to you
in these sessions.

18:56.596 --> 18:58.472
Fine, but you will have
to sit with me

18:58.514 --> 19:00.141
for the full session.

19:00.182 --> 19:02.685
Every single session.

19:02.727 --> 19:07.023
Now, Lucille, I can't
make you talk.

19:07.065 --> 19:09.525
But you know what I can do?

19:15.322 --> 19:17.075
Hmm?

19:19.077 --> 19:22.329
Okay, I can't trick you
into talking, either.

19:22.371 --> 19:24.665
<i>This went on</i>
<i>for several sessions.</i>

19:32.048 --> 19:34.550
Perhaps that's
why they call this place

19:34.592 --> 19:37.720
Au-stare-ity.

19:40.098 --> 19:41.182
No?

19:43.225 --> 19:45.895
Au-stare-i...

19:45.937 --> 19:47.021
Fine.

19:47.063 --> 19:48.064
Well, if you're
not going to talk,

19:48.106 --> 19:49.315
I'm just going to...

19:49.356 --> 19:51.233
- write this up.
<i>- Earlier that day,</i>

19:51.275 --> 19:53.277
<i>Tobias had encountered</i>
<i>a plot problem</i>

19:53.319 --> 19:55.155
<i>with the</i>
<i>"Fantastic Four" musical.</i>

19:55.196 --> 19:56.363
A villain.

19:56.405 --> 19:57.991
I was thinking the same thing.

19:58.032 --> 20:00.743
I mean, why aren't the
Fantastic Four fighting anyone.

20:00.785 --> 20:02.453
Instead of just
dancing around, you mean.

20:02.495 --> 20:04.622
Right, it's like all Sharks
and no Jets.

20:04.664 --> 20:06.666
Then we would have a second act.

20:06.707 --> 20:08.334
Lucia, right?

20:08.375 --> 20:09.836
I mean, that's their foe.

20:09.877 --> 20:11.212
Lucia Von Bardass?

20:12.839 --> 20:15.424
Have you guys ever
even read one of these things?

20:15.466 --> 20:17.844
<i>So Tobias was glad for the</i>
<i>break in Lucille's sessions.</i>

20:17.885 --> 20:18.886
- ...to do this right?
<i>- So that he could work on it.</i>

20:18.928 --> 20:20.387
I mean, really right.

20:20.429 --> 20:22.807
This woman is a villain.

20:22.849 --> 20:24.184
You think I'm a villain, too?

20:24.225 --> 20:25.476
- No...
- My children

20:25.518 --> 20:27.020
are all waiting for me to die

20:27.061 --> 20:28.521
so they can divvy up my stuff,

20:28.562 --> 20:30.481
my Chinese gang mates were
getting ready

20:30.523 --> 20:33.151
to noodle stab me,
and even one of the guards

20:33.193 --> 20:35.195
called me "Gangie,"
and he was talking

20:35.236 --> 20:36.570
about the monster movie.

20:36.612 --> 20:39.032
He thinks that horrible
monster looks like me!

20:39.073 --> 20:41.534
So fine, you want to call me
a villain, I accept it!

20:41.575 --> 20:42.827
I'm your villain!

20:42.869 --> 20:45.038
Uh, actually I was writing down

20:45.079 --> 20:46.080
a casting breakdown

20:46.122 --> 20:47.874
for the role of Lucia

20:47.915 --> 20:49.667
for my "Fantastic Four" musical.

20:49.709 --> 20:52.628
This was all
about your stupid play?

20:52.670 --> 20:54.255
I was about to cry

20:54.296 --> 20:56.423
for the first time in 60 years.

20:56.465 --> 20:58.968
I remember when
the last time was, too.

20:59.010 --> 21:01.929
I hid under Mama's porch
during a thunderstorm...

21:01.971 --> 21:04.140
(voice breaks): and I found
the remains of my ostri...

21:04.182 --> 21:06.642
It's not a stupid play.

21:06.684 --> 21:08.186
It's a musical.

21:08.228 --> 21:09.520
And I have to debut it

21:09.562 --> 21:11.105
on a boat at Cinco.

21:12.314 --> 21:13.649
It's on a boat?

21:13.691 --> 21:15.193
Take to the sea!

21:15.235 --> 21:17.653
Yes, I'll sign everyone out
for the night,

21:17.695 --> 21:20.990
but I guess I'll have to play
the old sea bitch myself.

21:21.032 --> 21:22.616
I'm in.

21:22.658 --> 21:24.326
Really?

21:24.368 --> 21:25.912
Well, that's wonderful.

21:25.953 --> 21:27.914
Well, I think we have made
a breakthrough today.

21:27.955 --> 21:30.041
In the musical, not you.

21:30.083 --> 21:32.793
Oh, God, no, there's miles
of work to do with you. (laughs)

21:32.835 --> 21:35.379
<i>But, of course,</i>
<i>he would make her audition.</i>

21:35.421 --> 21:37.464
<i>So Lucille wrote a song</i>
<i>from the heart.</i>

21:37.506 --> 21:39.133
LUCILLE:
♪ My children despise me ♪

21:39.175 --> 21:40.760
♪ My husband defies me ♪

21:40.801 --> 21:42.344
♪ It doesn't surprise me ♪

21:42.386 --> 21:43.679
♪ The hell with them all ♪

21:43.721 --> 21:45.472
♪ I'll put up a wall ♪

21:45.514 --> 21:47.474
♪ You think I'm a villain ♪

21:47.516 --> 21:48.893
♪ A villain I'll be ♪

21:48.935 --> 21:50.561
♪ My heart is in pain ♪

21:50.603 --> 21:52.563
♪ I just want to flee ♪

21:52.605 --> 21:54.899
♪ From me. ♪

21:56.567 --> 21:57.902
Wonderful.

21:57.944 --> 21:59.279
Terrifying.

21:59.320 --> 22:00.321
Isn't she?

22:00.362 --> 22:01.572
Betty, you can leave.

22:01.614 --> 22:03.407
Lucille, would you please stay?

22:03.449 --> 22:06.286
<i>But staying was the last thing</i>
<i>Lucille had in mind.</i>

22:06.327 --> 22:07.745
- (phone rings)
- LUCILLE: Hello?

22:07.787 --> 22:09.747
MAN: I want to be with you;
I... I have needs.

22:09.789 --> 22:10.706
George, is that you?

22:10.748 --> 22:12.250
<i>It wasn't.</i>

22:12.292 --> 22:14.835
<i>It was Oscar who,</i>
<i>living as George,</i>

22:14.877 --> 22:16.963
<i>- and feeling more amorous...</i>
- (Oscar whistles)

22:17.004 --> 22:20.341
<i>...went to visit Lucille 2</i>
<i>for an afternoon delight.</i>

22:20.382 --> 22:22.593
<i>When she wasn't there,</i>
<i>he found her work number.</i>

22:22.635 --> 22:23.677
WOMAN:
Austerity.

22:23.719 --> 22:25.096
Lucille 2, please?

22:25.138 --> 22:27.098
<i>But, of course, at Austerity,</i>

22:27.140 --> 22:29.516
<i>- this woman is Lucille 2.</i>
- Hello.

22:29.558 --> 22:31.518
I want to be with you;
I... I have needs.

22:31.560 --> 22:33.104
LUCILLE:
George, is that you?

22:33.146 --> 22:35.356
<i>But a newly virile Oscar</i>
<i>figured, in a pinch,</i>

22:35.397 --> 22:37.233
<i>any Lucille would do.</i>

22:37.275 --> 22:39.693
Yes, this is George.
Where are you?

22:39.735 --> 22:41.279
I'm in rehab, you know that.

22:41.321 --> 22:43.906
Why don't I swing by,
and we can conjugate?

22:43.948 --> 22:45.532
Let's do our business
over the phone.

22:45.574 --> 22:48.494
May not have a lot of time,
but, uh, all right, here goes:

22:48.535 --> 22:51.705
I want to pull your panties
off with my...

22:51.747 --> 22:53.207
Real business, George.

22:53.249 --> 22:56.418
I'd very much like to pull your
underwear off with my teeth...

22:56.460 --> 22:57.837
LUCILLE:
No-- at Cinco,

22:57.878 --> 23:00.298
we're getting on a boat,
we're leaving the country.

23:00.340 --> 23:01.799
OSCAR:
But what about love?

23:01.841 --> 23:04.969
Easy-- Gene Parmesan
got photos of Herbert Love

23:05.011 --> 23:06.179
with some redheaded whore.

23:06.220 --> 23:09.640
I'm giving his wife a taste,
so he knows we know.

23:09.682 --> 23:12.935
If he wins, we should be able to
get him to do whatever we want

23:12.977 --> 23:14.561
with that wall now.

23:14.603 --> 23:15.604
- (phone beeps)
- I'm not completely following...

23:15.646 --> 23:17.190
Oop. Hold on.

23:17.231 --> 23:19.150
<i>And that's when Lucille finally</i>
<i>had a visit from her son.</i>

23:19.192 --> 23:21.194
- Hello.
- Michael Bluth here to see you.

23:21.235 --> 23:22.736
Send him up.

23:22.778 --> 23:24.864
- OSCAR: ...with my teeth.
- Michael's here.

23:24.905 --> 23:26.366
- Oh...
- This is my chance to make sure

23:26.407 --> 23:28.034
he doesn't get
too cozy with Gob.

23:28.075 --> 23:30.161
- Why?
- Bad things happen

23:30.203 --> 23:31.871
when brothers collude.

23:36.334 --> 23:37.918
When can we have sex?

23:37.960 --> 23:39.170
LUCILLE:
After Cinco.

23:39.212 --> 23:40.921
Cinco?

23:40.963 --> 23:43.549
LUCILLE: Just get a boat ready,
we'll make our getaway.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.467
So not... not today.

23:45.509 --> 23:49.013
<i>And that's when she saw Michael</i>
<i>for the first time</i>

23:49.055 --> 23:51.391
<i>since the last time</i>
<i>he left the family.</i>

23:51.432 --> 23:52.766
Wow.

23:52.808 --> 23:54.227
This is a step up from prison.

23:54.268 --> 23:55.811
How would you know?

23:55.853 --> 23:57.397
You haven't come
to visit me once.

23:57.438 --> 23:58.398
Yeah. Sorry.

23:58.439 --> 23:59.815
I feel bad about that.

23:59.857 --> 24:01.483
So you're here to make amends?

24:01.525 --> 24:04.070
Because you know your mother
will always take you back.

24:04.111 --> 24:06.655
And because
I know my mother wants me

24:06.697 --> 24:08.949
to sign away any connection
to the family business.

24:08.991 --> 24:09.951
I just need a signature.

24:09.992 --> 24:11.535
I'm happy to help.
If...

24:11.577 --> 24:13.871
- you do something for me.
- For me.

24:13.913 --> 24:16.207
Yeah, I heard
that's been happening.

24:16.249 --> 24:18.459
I'm happy to help you, honey.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.461
Me, too.

24:20.502 --> 24:23.172
<i>And that's how Michael got his</i>
<i>mother's rights to the movie.</i>

24:23.214 --> 24:25.716
<i>But not right away.</i>

24:37.019 --> 24:38.104
So happy to help.

24:38.145 --> 24:39.105
Me, too.

24:39.146 --> 24:41.523
- So, everything else is good?
- Yeah.

24:41.565 --> 24:44.026
You've talked to your sister,
the radical?

24:44.068 --> 24:46.070
Yeah. She's a redhead now,
and she's dating Herbert Love,

24:46.112 --> 24:47.863
but other than her looks
and her belief system,

24:47.905 --> 24:49.365
- Oh...
- she's the same old Lindsay.

24:49.407 --> 24:52.243
So that's Lindsay in the photo.

24:52.285 --> 24:53.953
And I hear you're dating
an actress...

24:53.994 --> 24:55.455
who's also dating Ron Howard?

24:55.496 --> 24:56.456
(wry laugh)

24:56.497 --> 24:57.998
No, no...
no, no, no, no, no, no.

24:58.040 --> 25:00.167
She is not dating
Ron Howard, Mother.

25:00.209 --> 25:01.449
Ron Howard is her father, okay?

25:01.461 --> 25:02.878
(Michael chuckles)

25:02.920 --> 25:04.922
Your mind...

25:04.964 --> 25:07.091
I did, though, actually
find out who she is dating.

25:07.133 --> 25:09.093
<i>Michael had found out,</i>
<i>earlier that day,</i>

25:09.135 --> 25:11.553
<i>when he visited</i>
<i>her apartment to head off</i>

25:11.595 --> 25:15.182
<i>any ill feelings</i>
<i>she might have about this...</i>

25:15.224 --> 25:16.642
I'll do everything
in my power to make sure

25:16.683 --> 25:17.851
she never dates you again.

25:17.893 --> 25:18.894
<i>Or this...</i>

25:18.936 --> 25:20.146
You are ruining
my life, Ron Howard!

25:20.187 --> 25:21.314
Nice, right?

25:21.355 --> 25:22.773
Is too big.

25:22.815 --> 25:25.067
She likes small.

25:25.109 --> 25:26.986
LEM:
Can I please have ice cream?

25:27.027 --> 25:30.197
No, no, you are a Depardieu.
No sweets.

25:30.239 --> 25:32.283
Getting excited about Cinco?

25:32.325 --> 25:35.661
Your Cinco, not ours.

25:38.705 --> 25:42.084
<i>Michael wasn't proud</i>
<i>of what he was about to do.</i>

25:42.126 --> 25:44.170
Hey, Lem, I can reach
the ice cream and, you know,

25:44.211 --> 25:45.671
in my family,
we play a game called

25:45.712 --> 25:49.383
"If You Do Something For Me."

25:49.425 --> 25:50.884
Rules are meant
to be broken, huh?

25:50.926 --> 25:54.054
I will give you this Dove bar,
if you do something for me.

25:54.096 --> 25:55.389
We have Dove bars?

25:55.431 --> 25:57.183
We do. Look at that.

25:57.224 --> 26:01.187
Tell me what you know
about this "George Maharis."

26:01.228 --> 26:02.146
Not much.

26:02.188 --> 26:03.230
He's old.

26:03.272 --> 26:04.565
Is he older than me?

26:04.606 --> 26:05.816
A few years.

26:05.858 --> 26:07.193
He looks like you.

26:08.277 --> 26:10.154
So, handsome.

26:10.196 --> 26:12.532
<i>And that's when Lucille</i>
<i>found a way</i>

26:12.573 --> 26:14.408
<i>to keep the brothers</i>
<i>from colluding.</i>

26:14.450 --> 26:16.076
George Maharis.

26:16.118 --> 26:18.078
George--
that's your brother's name.

26:18.120 --> 26:19.663
George Oscar Bluth.

26:19.705 --> 26:23.376
Yes, uh, George
is Gob's first name, yep.

26:23.417 --> 26:24.751
<i>And that's when Michael</i>

26:24.793 --> 26:26.712
<i>remembered something else</i>
<i>strange.</i>

26:30.216 --> 26:32.176
I probably should have
expected that.

26:32.218 --> 26:33.177
<i>And then stranger...</i>

26:33.219 --> 26:35.012
MICHAEL:
"Love each other..."

26:35.054 --> 26:37.139
Oh, that definitely
sounds like Gob.

26:37.181 --> 26:39.975
<i>And he did say he was</i>
<i>seeing someone famous...</i>

26:40.017 --> 26:41.435
...dating someone famous.

26:41.477 --> 26:43.896
<i>And Michael remembered</i>
<i>hearing about that, as well.</i>

26:43.937 --> 26:45.856
Me doth think he hath a lady.

26:45.898 --> 26:49.318
- Oh.
- And they're both a bit of celebrities.

26:49.360 --> 26:51.987
Well, that is odd, because I,
I'm also dating a celebrity.

26:52.029 --> 26:53.239
If I were you,
I'd put a tail on him.

26:53.280 --> 26:55.074
Get a P.I.

26:55.115 --> 26:57.451
Where the hell
am I gonna find a P.I.?

26:57.493 --> 26:58.869
Gene Parmesan...

26:58.911 --> 27:00.538
at your service.

27:00.580 --> 27:01.539
(screaming)

27:01.581 --> 27:02.540
Gene!

27:02.582 --> 27:04.666
He does this to me every time!

27:04.708 --> 27:06.869
- What's he doing here, Mom?
- Oh, he's working for me.

27:06.877 --> 27:07.836
Why'd you scream, then?

27:07.878 --> 27:11.298
I thought he was that guy.

27:13.634 --> 27:15.677
Mm.

27:17.054 --> 27:18.847
NARRATOR:
<i>At Lucille's behest,</i>

27:18.889 --> 27:21.975
<i>Michael borrowed the family</i>
<i>P.I. to follow his brother.</i>

27:22.017 --> 27:24.061
GENE:
He just drove by. Pick me up.

27:24.103 --> 27:26.647
MICHAEL:
This is the great disguise, huh?

27:26.688 --> 27:28.023
Fry cook!

27:28.065 --> 27:29.942
Oh, no, no,
this is my horrible night job.

27:29.983 --> 27:32.069
In fact, I was hoping
you could drop me off

27:32.111 --> 27:33.737
at Chicken Dan's
when we're all done.

27:33.779 --> 27:34.780
Chicken Dan's, huh?

27:34.821 --> 27:36.365
That is embarrassing.

27:36.407 --> 27:38.534
This from a man who's driving
around a mapping car?

27:38.576 --> 27:40.453
You know, I don't even think
these things work.

27:40.494 --> 27:42.413
That's why I rely
on these babies right here--

27:42.455 --> 27:43.747
the old binocs.

27:43.789 --> 27:45.874
Let's see if we can't find
this target.

27:45.916 --> 27:47.918
You know, the great thing
about these is,

27:47.960 --> 27:50.630
there's no software to update...

27:50.671 --> 27:52.381
- Oh, God, what are you doing?
- Sorry.

27:52.423 --> 27:54.049
Oh, these binoculars
make me nauseous.

27:54.091 --> 27:55.217
MICHAEL:
Well, of course they do.

27:55.259 --> 27:56.718
Why don't you just use the maps?

27:56.760 --> 27:59.346
- No.
- We're in a satellite-linked mapping car.

27:59.388 --> 28:02.182
No, no. Sometimes
the old ways are the...

28:02.224 --> 28:03.434
- Hey.
- You-you better pull over.

28:03.476 --> 28:04.644
- All right, hang on.
- Pull over!

28:04.685 --> 28:06.061
One, two.

28:06.103 --> 28:07.104
<i>And while Michael was</i>
<i>waylaid...</i>

28:07.146 --> 28:08.397
One, two...

28:08.439 --> 28:09.315
<i>...Lucille was working</i>
<i>on her tap dancing.</i>

28:09.356 --> 28:10.399

Tell her she missed a step.

28:26.415 --> 28:27.833
She can't do it like that.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.627
<i>- ...on people's feelings.</i>
- Oh, uh,

28:29.669 --> 28:31.545
DeBrie, you might have missed
a step, so...

28:31.587 --> 28:33.880
- Sorry. I think I might...I hurt my leg.
- Oh.

28:33.922 --> 28:36.634
And so, I need some, mm,
Tylenol with c-codeine?

28:36.676 --> 28:38.636
Or maybe
a little morphie morph?

28:38.678 --> 28:40.179
No. DeBrie, come on. (laughs)

28:40.220 --> 28:42.014
Don't you want to get back
on that horse?

28:42.055 --> 28:43.599
Even better!

28:43.641 --> 28:45.476
<i>She was the best</i>
<i>villain casting</i>

28:45.518 --> 28:48.354

28:48.395 --> 28:50.189
<i>And on the night of Cinco,</i>

28:50.230 --> 28:51.565
<i>Lucille's escape plans</i>

28:51.607 --> 28:53.775
<i>got a step closer</i>

28:53.817 --> 28:57.070
<i>Oscar did indeed borrow a boat</i>
<i>and left it idling,</i>

28:57.112 --> 29:00.949
<i>which unfortunately, was what</i>
<i>this man was looking for.</i>

29:00.991 --> 29:03.494
<i>And Lucille slipped away</i>
<i>from the cast,</i>

29:03.536 --> 29:05.829
<i>looking for her husband.</i>

29:05.871 --> 29:08.457
There you are!

29:08.499 --> 29:10.626
What are you doing here?

29:10.668 --> 29:12.545
What do you mean,
what am I doing here?

29:12.586 --> 29:14.338
We made plans...
to escape on the boat!

29:14.380 --> 29:16.507
I never made plans with you.

29:16.549 --> 29:20.135
But we talked
about it on the phone,

29:20.177 --> 29:21.887
when you were trying
to talk dirty to me.

29:21.928 --> 29:23.347
- Oh.
- What is wrong with you?

29:23.389 --> 29:25.224
This is... this is embarrassing.
Full disclosure.

29:25.265 --> 29:26.726
Uh, that was Oscar,

29:26.767 --> 29:28.769
who may have been the one
you were talking with.

29:28.852 --> 29:31.980
He's been filling in...
for me occasionally.

29:32.022 --> 29:35.651
Filling in?
As in, visiting me?

29:35.693 --> 29:38.487
You sent your brother
to have sex with me?

29:38.529 --> 29:40.197
No, I sent him to listen to you

29:40.239 --> 29:42.241
one time, and then,
he found out about the wall,

29:42.282 --> 29:43.909
and tried to get you
talking about it,

29:43.950 --> 29:46.746
and this was his way
of shutting you up.

29:46.787 --> 29:48.955
- He told you this?
- No, you told me

29:48.997 --> 29:50.332
when I visited.

29:50.374 --> 29:53.210
I got in there
a couple of times... too.

29:53.252 --> 29:54.712
Oh, but not for sex.

29:54.754 --> 29:56.630
I don't have the tiger
in my tank anymore.

29:56.672 --> 29:58.424
Maybe I do need a vacay.

29:58.465 --> 29:59.800
So, tell me about this trip.

29:59.841 --> 30:01.552
That's interesting.
Where we going?

30:01.594 --> 30:03.178
I'll tell you where we're going.

30:03.220 --> 30:04.722
We're going to court.

30:04.764 --> 30:06.848
We're getting a real divorce.

30:06.890 --> 30:09.309
You're out of the marriage.

30:09.351 --> 30:11.186
Lucille...?

30:11.228 --> 30:14.440
<i>And that's when she came</i>
<i>face to face with the man...</i>

30:14.481 --> 30:16.108
<i>...whose face</i>
<i>she'd just faced...</i>

30:16.149 --> 30:17.777
- Are you ready?
- <i>...but it was a different...</i>

30:17.818 --> 30:19.403
<i>- It-it was Oscar.</i>
- Hello, Oscar.

30:19.445 --> 30:21.488
You should get an Oscar
for your portrayal of George

30:21.530 --> 30:23.532
in "Screw the Oblivious
Sister-in-law."

30:23.574 --> 30:26.577
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

30:26.619 --> 30:27.661
You-you got me.

30:27.703 --> 30:29.538
I was gon...
I was gonna tell you.

30:29.580 --> 30:31.832
I was acting
when I pretended to be George,

30:31.873 --> 30:34.000
but I am dead serious when I say

30:34.042 --> 30:37.630
you are the hottest woman
I know.

30:37.671 --> 30:42.468
I'm here tonight because
I want to run away with you.

30:42.509 --> 30:44.010
Oscar. Really?

30:44.052 --> 30:45.763
Of course. What?

30:45.805 --> 30:48.515
Do you think I'm here for the
donkey punch? Which I do love,

30:48.557 --> 30:50.517
and it's the only night
you can get it.

30:50.559 --> 30:53.604
But you are the only woman
for me, Lucille!

30:53.646 --> 30:57.065
Bring me those thin,
pot-stained lips.

30:57.107 --> 30:58.818
Oh, honey.

30:58.859 --> 31:00.653
(both moaning)

31:00.694 --> 31:02.404
- What's this?
- I have no idea.

31:02.446 --> 31:03.947
<i>And that's when she found out</i>
<i>the latest thing</i>

31:03.989 --> 31:06.032
<i>that was hers</i>
<i>that had been claimed.</i>

31:06.074 --> 31:08.577
<i>He'd actually acquired it</i>
<i>earlier that night</i>

31:08.619 --> 31:10.704
<i>when he was... polling</i>
<i>for Lucille 2.</i>

31:10.746 --> 31:13.206
- That, um...
- She's claimed you!

31:13.248 --> 31:15.459
Everyone I know wants
to take everything away from me!

31:15.501 --> 31:16.710
No! That's not true.

31:16.752 --> 31:18.044
I love you.

31:18.086 --> 31:19.963
I don't know if it's the maca.

31:20.005 --> 31:21.715
I've just been so randy lately.

31:21.757 --> 31:24.050
But you're...

31:24.092 --> 31:25.344
you...

31:25.385 --> 31:27.095
you're my kind of Lucille!

31:27.137 --> 31:28.347
Get away from me, you liar.

31:28.388 --> 31:30.474
I can't believe
you were with her.

31:30.516 --> 31:32.142
She's finished.

31:32.184 --> 31:34.645
And the Oscar goes, too!

31:34.687 --> 31:36.021
To...?

31:36.062 --> 31:37.481
Get out of my sight!

31:37.523 --> 31:38.816
<i>She was in an emotional storm</i>

31:38.858 --> 31:40.860
<i>and could have used</i>
<i>a therapist.</i>

31:40.901 --> 31:42.820
- Oh, my God...
- TOBIAS: Lucille!

31:42.862 --> 31:44.822
<i>- When she ran into a therapist</i>
- Where are you going?

31:44.864 --> 31:46.448
<i>who could've used a storm.</i>

31:46.490 --> 31:47.949
To disappear.

31:47.991 --> 31:49.869
That's what everyone
wants me to do.

31:49.910 --> 31:52.830
Lucille!

31:52.872 --> 31:55.040
You are not the villain.

31:55.081 --> 31:57.000
(sighs)

31:57.042 --> 31:58.919
I'm so tired
of being the villain.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.420
Well, those days are over.

32:00.462 --> 32:03.590
What you are
is the Invisible Girl.

32:03.632 --> 32:05.258
You make it impossible
for people

32:05.300 --> 32:07.093
to see you in order
to protect yourself.

32:07.135 --> 32:08.637
<i>And somehow, in that moment,</i>

32:08.679 --> 32:10.055
<i>something changed for her.</i>

32:10.096 --> 32:11.473
I do do that.

32:11.515 --> 32:13.392
And in this way, you launch

32:13.433 --> 32:15.143
sneak attacks,
and you create a force field

32:15.185 --> 32:16.562
to keep people away.

32:16.603 --> 32:18.605
Right! I'm not a villain.

32:18.647 --> 32:20.357
I'm the Invisible Girl!

32:20.399 --> 32:21.901
Yes, that's what I'm saying!

32:21.942 --> 32:25.153
Oh, you know, it's funny...
I never would have

32:25.195 --> 32:28.407
come to this if it hadn't been
for Lucille 2's rehab.

32:28.448 --> 32:31.952
I need to pay her back
for everything she's done to me.

32:31.993 --> 32:34.914
I'm going back to rehab.

32:34.955 --> 32:38.876
I just have
to make one quick stop first.

32:38.918 --> 32:40.586
I don't think we have time.

32:40.627 --> 32:42.228
<i>And that's the night</i>
<i>that Lucille decided</i>

32:42.254 --> 32:43.714
<i>she didn't want</i>
<i>to be invisible anymore.</i>

32:43.756 --> 32:45.465
I've got to do this...

32:45.507 --> 32:47.927
<i>And perhaps, ironically,</i>
<i>it was also</i>

32:47.968 --> 32:52.389
<i>the night that Lucille 2</i>
<i>became the Invisible Girl.</i>

32:52.431 --> 32:54.057

32:58.645 --> 33:00.731
<i>originally meant</i>
<i>for Lucille's escape,</i>

<i>and after making one stop,</i>
<i>faces the awful truth.</i>

33:04.526 --> 33:08.029
They're going to be talking
about this bomb for years.

33:08.071 --> 33:10.323
TOBIAS:
Oh, God, it is bad, isn't it?

33:10.365 --> 33:12.534
Lindsay was right
to discourage me.

33:14.369 --> 33:16.413
- Tobias?
- Marky?

33:16.455 --> 33:18.498
If you're not Lindsay,
then where is Lindsay?

33:18.540 --> 33:19.959
Isn't that her
on the love boat?

33:20.000 --> 33:22.628
- But I just put a bomb on the love boat!
- What?!

33:22.669 --> 33:24.189
- Lindsay! Lindsay!
- Lindsay! Lindsay!

33:24.212 --> 33:25.505
Lindsay, there's a bomb!

33:28.383 --> 33:29.342
<i>Lindsay remembers</i>
<i>she's on a boat...</i>

33:29.384 --> 33:30.260
Oh, (bleep)

33:30.302 --> 33:32.345
