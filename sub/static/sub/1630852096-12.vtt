DETMER:
We're officially out of
the galactic barrier

00:12.055 --> 00:13.839
and into extragalactic space.

00:13.883 --> 00:16.799
Whatever happened here
with Oros, it drives you.

00:16.842 --> 00:20.020

I built my own transporter
to get back to him.

00:20.063 --> 00:21.238
Whatever we think we know

00:21.282 --> 00:23.284
about Species Ten-C,
we're wrong.

00:23.327 --> 00:26.156
However we think first contact
will go, it won't.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.550
BURNHAM:
The Ten-C are hidden
inside a hyperfield,

00:28.593 --> 00:30.813
and right now I have no idea
how to get in,

00:30.856 --> 00:34.121
what we'll find once we do,
or what they even look like.

00:34.164 --> 00:35.774
If I know Michael,
she'll find a way

00:35.818 --> 00:37.298
into the hyperfield
before we do.

00:37.341 --> 00:38.647
TARKA:
I can create a patch.

00:38.690 --> 00:39.909
It'll numb the sensors

00:39.952 --> 00:41.302
on a section of
Discovery's hull,

00:41.345 --> 00:42.694
just big enough
to attach your ship

00:42.738 --> 00:44.435
without Zora realizing it.

00:44.479 --> 00:46.481
My ship will enter
into the hyperfield

00:46.524 --> 00:48.048
attached to Discovery.

00:48.091 --> 00:50.093
Tarka will find the DMA's
power source and disable it.

00:50.137 --> 00:52.617
That'll stop the DMA.
Earth will be safe.

00:52.661 --> 00:54.010
How do I fit in to all of this?

00:54.054 --> 00:55.490
Stay in contact. That's it.

00:55.533 --> 00:57.666
So that's the hyperfield.

00:57.709 --> 00:59.015
There is a planet

00:59.059 --> 01:00.495
about two light-years away
from it.

01:00.538 --> 01:02.018
I really think
we should check it out.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.715
We sent DOTs down
to the planet's surface.

01:03.759 --> 01:07.632
They recovered
16 unique compounds.

He has replicated
the hydrocarbon

04:13.644 --> 04:14.776
Yes, General, we will.

04:14.819 --> 04:16.299
And at such close distance,

04:16.343 --> 04:18.475
the hyperfield's radiation
may impact the warp core,

04:18.519 --> 04:21.522

statistically significant.

Is taking on this level of risk
really prudent?

what it's like to lose a world,

Any progress restoring systems?

13:11.878 --> 13:13.444
Engineering says that the orb is

13:13.488 --> 13:14.750
somehow keeping them
powered down.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.360
Nothing they've tried
has worked.

13:16.404 --> 13:17.840
Have them try something else.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.146
SARU [over comm]:
Captain, we need you

13:19.189 --> 13:21.844
for a first contact discussion.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.237
Commander Rhys,
you have the conn.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.542
Let me know if anything changes.

13:25.456 --> 13:28.198
STAMETS:
She says there's a malfunction
in her system somewhere,

13:28.242 --> 13:31.593
but I checked the logs,
Zora ran diagnostics,

13:31.636 --> 13:33.247
nothing seemed
out of the ordinary.

13:33.290 --> 13:36.946
Well, sometimes getting
to the root cause of a feeling

13:36.990 --> 13:39.296
is helped by focusing
on the feeling itself.

13:39.340 --> 13:40.471
We'll talk.

13:40.515 --> 13:42.038
I appreciate that.

13:42.082 --> 13:43.257
Thank you.

13:43.300 --> 13:46.042
Hugh. Are you all right?

13:46.086 --> 13:48.262
Yeah, I just...

13:48.305 --> 13:51.134
I keep thinking about
what I felt down on that planet.

13:51.178 --> 13:54.616
Peace, calm, comfort.

13:54.659 --> 13:57.271
It's been a long time
since I had that, and...

13:57.314 --> 13:59.621
I'm not sure how to get
back there, you know?

13:59.664 --> 14:02.058
Well, I need to get back
to Adira and the team.

14:02.102 --> 14:05.627
But when this is all over,
we're taking a vacation.

14:05.670 --> 14:08.195
-[chuckles]
-Just the two of us.

14:08.238 --> 14:09.718
Deal.

14:13.678 --> 14:16.159
All right, let's get started.

14:16.203 --> 14:17.639
ZORA:
How?

14:17.682 --> 14:20.120
Well, we'll play the Trill game
while we talk.

14:20.163 --> 14:21.208
Helped you before.

14:21.251 --> 14:22.992
I'll set it up for us.

14:25.342 --> 14:27.997
RILLAK:
But why would the Ten-C
bring us in here,

14:28.041 --> 14:32.784
scan us extensively, and then
not even engage with us?

14:32.828 --> 14:34.569
I might speculate that they are

14:34.612 --> 14:37.920
attempting to understand our
technology before proceeding.

14:37.964 --> 14:41.228
Speculation is of little use
in this moment.

14:41.271 --> 14:42.882
We require answers.

14:44.971 --> 14:47.364
Could it be that they're using
a communication frequency

14:47.408 --> 14:49.801
-we're unaware of?
-More likely they're waiting

14:49.845 --> 14:52.065
for us to communicate
a sense of purpose.

14:52.108 --> 14:55.764
Our message conveyed no intent,
merely a lack of threat.

14:55.807 --> 14:56.983
NDOYE:
We cannot hope to conduct

14:57.026 --> 14:58.854
effective diplomacy
as prisoners.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.857
Communication is
our only option right now.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.164
We don't even know
how to get them to speak to us.

15:08.429 --> 15:09.952
BURNHAM:
I have an idea.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.867
For centuries,
it's been Federation tradition

15:11.911 --> 15:14.348
to present a gift
during first contact

15:14.391 --> 15:15.784
as a way of building trust.

15:15.827 --> 15:18.700
Stamets collected
a few samples of boronite

15:18.743 --> 15:20.049
from the site
of the DMA implosion.

15:20.093 --> 15:22.922
Gift-giving can be
culturally complex.

15:22.965 --> 15:26.012
The Ten-C may not perceive it
as we intend.

15:26.055 --> 15:27.927
It's the only thing
we know for sure they want.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.494
I'm not sure
what other choice we have.

15:30.538 --> 15:31.887
Hmm.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.369
H-How could we possibly
deliver it?

15:36.196 --> 15:38.894
We could beam the particles
directly onto the orb membrane.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.897
It sized itself to fit our ship.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.768
It has to have
sensor capabilities.

15:47.816 --> 15:50.210
Let's give it a shot.

15:56.999 --> 16:00.350
Engines, shields, weapons,
all still down.

16:02.222 --> 16:04.093
Nothing's working.

16:04.137 --> 16:06.748
TARKA:
The Ten-C must be blocking
those systems. Don't worry.

16:06.791 --> 16:08.619
They'll come back
once I get us out of this orb.

16:08.663 --> 16:10.186
You found a way?

16:10.230 --> 16:12.058
When a nightsprey's
done nesting,

16:12.101 --> 16:15.278
there's only one way
to leave the jajtspat.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.803
RENO:
Hey.

16:19.804 --> 16:21.893
Why exactly did you team up
with that guy?

16:21.937 --> 16:25.462
He seems a couple of cherries
short of a sundae.

16:25.506 --> 16:29.597
He lost someone and made a vow
to get back to him.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.991
I respect that.

16:33.775 --> 16:35.603
My mentor, Cleveland Booker,
used to say

16:35.646 --> 16:38.606
the measure of someone is in
how they honor their promises.

16:38.649 --> 16:40.042
RENO:
You share a name with someone?

16:40.086 --> 16:42.044
That's not confusing at all.

16:42.871 --> 16:46.005
He's not called Book anymore.

16:47.876 --> 16:49.965
In the courier world,
trust is everything.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.794
Trust that someone will do
the job you paid them for,

16:52.837 --> 16:55.710
not rip you off or sell you out.

16:57.364 --> 17:01.107
The name Cleveland Booker
earned trust for generations,

17:01.150 --> 17:02.978
passed from one to another.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.328
Mine was the fourth in the line.

17:05.372 --> 17:07.809
When he retired,

17:07.852 --> 17:09.854
he gave his name
and his clients to me.

17:12.944 --> 17:14.816
I became the fifth.

17:14.859 --> 17:16.948
You think he'd approve of Tarka?

17:16.992 --> 17:20.039
I think he'd understand him.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.874
When my wife died,
I needed a focus.

17:29.918 --> 17:32.660
So I joined the Hiawatha.

17:32.703 --> 17:35.706
After we crashed,

17:35.750 --> 17:40.494
there was an ensign,
horribly burned.

17:40.537 --> 17:43.497
He begged me to let him go.

17:43.540 --> 17:47.196
I told him it was my duty
to keep him alive.

17:48.632 --> 17:52.723
I kept replicating skin grafts.

17:54.160 --> 17:57.424
It took 11 days for him to die.

17:57.467 --> 18:01.863
After he finally did,
that's when I saw that

18:01.906 --> 18:06.520
his eyes were
the same color as hers.

18:06.563 --> 18:08.957
The exact same green.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.046
That is why
I couldn't let him go.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.918
Not because of him,
because of me.

18:16.138 --> 18:20.229
You and Tarka have made
some dubious choices,

18:20.273 --> 18:23.711
because you're both in pain,
and you can't see it.

18:23.754 --> 18:26.888
I see you're trying
to work on me.

18:27.976 --> 18:29.934
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.

18:34.330 --> 18:36.506
How much longer
until we're free?

18:36.550 --> 18:38.117
TARKA:
Soon.

18:39.248 --> 18:40.858
SARU:
The boronite has been sent.

18:40.902 --> 18:42.904
No response yet, Captain.

18:43.731 --> 18:46.908
You're feeling it out as you go,
adapting, making choices.

18:46.951 --> 18:49.084
I respect that.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.173
But a soldier has to accept
when they've hit a wall.

18:51.217 --> 18:54.133
That's when the truly
hard choices need to be made.

18:56.309 --> 18:59.138
I used to think
there was no wall.

18:59.181 --> 19:02.315
As captain, my experience
has taught me otherwise.

19:03.403 --> 19:05.796
General,
we haven't hit it yet.

20:51.902 --> 20:54.209
Which hydrocarbons, exactly?

Each molecule is 25% joy,
22% sadness,

17% peacefulness,
14% irritation,

21:03.087 --> 21:06.439

That's six of the 16 emotions
we know they can feel.

21:09.703 --> 21:11.139
It's nonsensical.

21:11.182 --> 21:13.707
Perhaps it is attempting
to convey all six emotions

simultaneously.

[whirring]

21:23.412 --> 21:26.372
Incredible.
What could that mean?

be for communication, somehow.

21:32.639 --> 21:34.249
ZORA:
You may be right, Captain.

21:34.293 --> 21:37.165
The light pattern was identical
both times.

21:37.208 --> 21:40.342
If that's their language,
then the hydrocarbons

21:40.386 --> 21:44.346
must convey emotional inflection
and context.

21:44.390 --> 21:47.001
We need to mirror
the light pattern back to them.

21:47.044 --> 21:48.524
How will that move us forward?

21:48.568 --> 21:50.091
It'll show them
we recognize this

21:50.134 --> 21:51.353
as an effort to communicate.

21:51.397 --> 21:53.442
From there,
we'll need to find a way

21:53.486 --> 21:56.184
to convey simple
and then more complex thoughts.

21:56.227 --> 21:59.753
Sounds like the start of

Won't take nearly that long
to get us out of here,

22:45.755 --> 22:46.974
What kind of help?

22:47.017 --> 22:49.150
I need to ignite a plasma stream

22:49.193 --> 22:51.021

From there, a simple reversed

the exact moment

I started feeling so distracted,

25:40.364 --> 25:41.714

25:41.757 --> 25:44.238
that occurred
around the same time:

25:44.281 --> 25:45.848
a replicator-system malfunction.

25:45.892 --> 25:47.241
Commander Reno fixed it.

25:47.284 --> 25:49.373
Oh, well, maybe she can shed
some light.

25:49.417 --> 25:51.550
Commander Reno,
it's Dr. Culber.

25:53.639 --> 25:55.336
Zora, where's Commander Reno?

25:55.379 --> 25:57.468
My sensors show her

Oh. She's probably helping

25:59.383 --> 26:01.864
a way out of this orb.
I'll talk to her.

26:02.822 --> 26:04.954
One of my professors
at the Academy used to say

26:04.998 --> 26:08.523
that if a problem stumps you,
examine your assumptions.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.960
Now, we're assuming
that the hydrocarbons are

26:11.004 --> 26:12.962

of some kind?

the hydrocarbons contain

26:17.488 --> 26:19.403
emotional and semantic content?

26:19.447 --> 26:20.840
NILSSON:
Maybe it's like music.

26:20.883 --> 26:23.451
A piano piece evokes emotion
but also has

26:23.494 --> 26:25.671
a structure of pitches,
note lengths, tempo.

26:25.714 --> 26:29.152
BURNHAM:
Yes, what if the hydrocarbons
are the structure?

26:29.196 --> 26:32.068
If each is a symbol, or a word,

26:32.112 --> 26:34.375
then the molecules themselves
are the message.

26:34.418 --> 26:37.247
Zora, will you display a holo

to read this,

26:43.558 --> 26:45.386
how do we do it?
Where do we start?

26:45.429 --> 26:47.170
Which direction do we go?

26:47.214 --> 26:51.261
It's like an encrypted message,
but we're missing a key.

26:51.305 --> 26:54.656
Maybe the lights are a key.

26:54.700 --> 26:58.704
A star map is a 2D rendering

is a map
