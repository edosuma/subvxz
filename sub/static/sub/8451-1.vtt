00:31.000 --> 00:33.559
Hand over the milk money, Weaver.

00:36.535 --> 00:38.468
I can't do that, Derek.

00:38.536 --> 00:40.833
I'm not sure
you'll spend it on milk.

00:43.072 --> 00:45.005
That's me, Mitch Weaver.

00:45.073 --> 00:47.904
That's Sam, my lifelong best friend.

00:47.974 --> 00:51.875
I never had a dad growing up,
so Sam's dad Pops filled in a little.

00:51.944 --> 00:54.934
He was a boxer,
real tough guy.

00:55.012 --> 00:58.878
One thing to remember in life,
no matter where you go or what you do....

00:58.947 --> 01:01.641
don't take no crap from nobody.

01:01.714 --> 01:04.876
I never liked the guy,
but he was right about not taking crap.

01:04.950 --> 01:08.042
Wow! My dad sure is great.

01:08.118 --> 01:12.985
Hey, do you know where
he hides his guns?

01:13.054 --> 01:14.748
Don't worry.

01:18.024 --> 01:21.718
We planted the guns in the bully's desk
so he'd get in trouble.

01:21.791 --> 01:24.191
It wasn't me!

01:24.260 --> 01:28.091
Let me go!
They weren't mine!

01:28.161 --> 01:31.391
We always did stuff like that,
get back at people who messed with us.

01:31.463 --> 01:34.988
There was this crossing guard
used to grab all the kids' asses.

01:35.065 --> 01:37.828
Back then people weren't on
the lookout for that kind of thing.

01:37.900 --> 01:40.867
The only way to nail a guy like that
was to catch him red-handed.

01:40.935 --> 01:42.925
That's where Super Glue came in.

01:43.002 --> 01:46.959
Look, everybody! Crossing guard's
grabbing 8-year-old's ass over here!

01:52.573 --> 01:55.871
We really got back at
this ornery baby-sitter we didn't like.

01:57.843 --> 02:01.607
After all these years,
this picture still makes me horny.

02:01.679 --> 02:04.841
I mean, wistful!
It makes me wistful.

02:04.913 --> 02:08.210
When I was 16,
the saddest event of my life occurred.

02:08.281 --> 02:09.714
My mom died.

02:09.782 --> 02:14.240
Everyone did their best to console me,
particularly Aunt Jenny.

02:14.318 --> 02:17.047
It wasn't easy, because
I'm not comfortable expressing my...

02:17.119 --> 02:19.608
What do you call them? Emotions?

02:19.687 --> 02:22.450
Anyways, I learned to express myself
in other ways.

02:22.522 --> 02:25.284
I started making little notes to myself.

02:25.356 --> 02:27.017
Note to self.

02:27.091 --> 02:31.582
Remember, Aunt Jenny is your aunt.

02:31.659 --> 02:34.252
Then there was this character
we had to deal with.

02:34.328 --> 02:36.592
She thought just because she was
a meter maid...

02:36.663 --> 02:39.823
that she had the right to go around
giving everybody parking tickets.

02:39.897 --> 02:42.229
That's where the popcorn
came in handy.

02:49.769 --> 02:53.464
In high school, I still didn't take crap
from anyone, man or beast.

02:53.538 --> 02:55.630
This Doberman would always chase us.

02:55.706 --> 02:58.229
So we borrowed my cousin's
huge German shepherd...

02:58.306 --> 03:00.239
who also happens to be gay.

03:01.208 --> 03:03.504
Taught that Doberman some humility.

03:04.376 --> 03:06.138
Boy, those were the days.

03:06.210 --> 03:09.700
But then, something happened.
I grew up.

03:09.778 --> 03:13.474
Okay, 132 Highfield Avenue
in three minutes.

03:13.548 --> 03:15.742
I can make it.
I can make it.

03:18.049 --> 03:19.482
Oh, no!

03:31.457 --> 03:34.357
Hi, there.
Thirty minutes or free, right?

03:34.425 --> 03:37.449
And you took 32 minutes.

03:37.526 --> 03:40.221
So close and yet so far.

03:40.295 --> 03:43.386
Gimme a break. That free pizza
comes out of my paycheck.

03:43.462 --> 03:45.760
That doesn't seem fair, does it?

03:48.965 --> 03:51.125
Then the guy says,
"If you want the money for this pizza...

03:51.200 --> 03:54.293
you tell Aldo and the rest
of those sweaty Italian fruits...

03:54.369 --> 03:56.301
to come down
and get it from me themselves."

03:56.369 --> 04:01.531
Also, he started saying nasty things
about that Mussolini character.

04:01.604 --> 04:05.903
The guy called.
I know you didn't make it on time.

04:05.974 --> 04:09.169
None of the other pizza places have
the 30-minute thing anymore.

04:09.242 --> 04:10.674
Can't we drop it?

04:10.743 --> 04:13.643
You think we should drop
the 30-minute guarantee?

04:13.711 --> 04:16.837
You think Aldo's should be
just like all the others?

04:18.079 --> 04:21.444
Mitch Weaver, you're not fit
to wear this shirt.

04:49.129 --> 04:51.528
That's my Canadians jersey.

04:55.931 --> 04:58.195
You have anything in a 10-1l2 wide?

04:59.067 --> 05:00.931
Toni-Ann, what are you doing?

05:02.068 --> 05:05.093
I've had it. Uncle Aldo called.
He told me he fired you.

05:05.170 --> 05:10.003
That's your 14th job in the past
three months! I can't take it anymore!

05:10.073 --> 05:13.164
Honey, I understand you're upset.

05:13.240 --> 05:16.174
Maybe you'll feel better
after we have some dirty sex.

05:16.242 --> 05:20.370
Forget it! I'm through
wasting my life with you.

05:20.444 --> 05:21.876
Good-bye!

05:21.944 --> 05:25.003
- What about the rest of my stuff?
- Your stuff?

05:25.080 --> 05:27.013
There is no "your stuff."

05:27.081 --> 05:29.640
I have paid for everything
in this apartment.

05:31.183 --> 05:33.116
Wait a minute. That's not true.

05:33.184 --> 05:35.276
I paid for the popcorn machine.

05:48.558 --> 05:50.321
What's up, fruity?

05:50.393 --> 05:51.824
Hey, ass-bite.

05:52.860 --> 05:56.521
By the looks of this popcorn machine, I
guess she tossed you out for good, huh?

05:56.595 --> 05:58.186
Yep.

05:58.263 --> 06:00.457
Passed your car back there.

06:00.531 --> 06:03.556
- It's a nasty flat, but I can fix it.
- Thanks, Sam.

06:03.633 --> 06:07.328
I was wondering. Could I crash
with you and your dad for a while?

06:08.201 --> 06:12.465
No. I'm gonna turn away my best friend
so he's gotta sleep in his car. Come on.

06:15.305 --> 06:17.238
Hey, that's my shirt.

06:17.305 --> 06:19.636
You're wearing my shirt.

06:24.776 --> 06:26.208
Here you go.

06:26.277 --> 06:28.108
No, that's all right.

06:28.179 --> 06:30.839
I was talking to somebody else
that's different than you.

06:37.449 --> 06:40.144
Two, three, up.

06:40.217 --> 06:42.082
Press those knees straight.

06:42.152 --> 06:44.482
And again. Take it down.

06:44.553 --> 06:46.611
Two, three...

06:46.687 --> 06:48.177
and lift it up.

06:53.257 --> 06:55.986
- Pops, how you doin'?
- Pretty good, son.

06:56.059 --> 06:59.356
But it'd be goin' a lot better
if you brought me a whore.

06:59.427 --> 07:01.053
I thought you couldn't...

07:01.128 --> 07:03.720
I can't but...

07:03.795 --> 07:06.763
I subscribe to this magazine
to give me a few ideas.

07:06.831 --> 07:10.230
There's an article about home
stereo equipment, too. That's for you.

07:10.299 --> 07:11.890
That's great.

07:11.966 --> 07:14.991
- I'll be right back, all right?
- Yeah.

07:20.238 --> 07:21.670
Do me a favor.

07:21.738 --> 07:24.705
Could you stay with him for a while?

07:24.773 --> 07:26.330
What's the matter?

07:26.407 --> 07:29.704
You know how I feel about your father.
I'm uncomfortable around him.

07:29.775 --> 07:32.402
He's kind of... I don't know.

07:32.477 --> 07:34.468
Creepy, you know?

07:34.545 --> 07:36.807
He creeps the hell out of me,
to tell you the truth.

07:36.879 --> 07:38.607
He likes you.

07:38.680 --> 07:42.273
I gotta call somebody
to borrow a jack.

07:42.348 --> 07:44.281
Stay with him for a while.

07:44.349 --> 07:45.782
All right.

07:49.451 --> 07:51.385
Feelin' okay, Mr. McKenna?

07:51.453 --> 07:53.886
Don't worry about me.

07:53.955 --> 07:57.582
I just want to thank you
for spending a little time with me.

07:57.656 --> 08:00.317
- Well, no problem.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:00.391 --> 08:03.789
- I also want to say I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

08:03.859 --> 08:07.588
For being a creepy old man.

08:07.660 --> 08:09.957
I apologize, you rotten bastard!

08:10.028 --> 08:13.962
- You say those things about me?
- Pops! Pops! Let go!

08:14.030 --> 08:17.965
Get out of here, Sam!
I'll kill this bastard!

08:18.033 --> 08:21.193
I can still hear,
no matter how creepy I look.

08:21.267 --> 08:24.861
- It's Mitch! Let go.
- All right, take him.

08:24.936 --> 08:27.562
Everything's falling apart.

08:27.637 --> 08:29.696
Remember how things were
when we were young?

08:29.771 --> 08:31.864
Yeah, it was great.

08:31.940 --> 08:33.371
Yeah, it was.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.929
I felt good about myself back then.

08:36.008 --> 08:39.806
If somebody messed with me, no problem.
I didn't take crap from anybody.

08:39.876 --> 08:44.006
Now I'm in my 30s, I can't hold a job.
I go out with women I don't even like.

08:44.080 --> 08:47.444
Worst of all, I take crap
from absolutely everybody.

08:48.448 --> 08:50.142
Things could be worse.

08:50.215 --> 08:53.705
I could've got my nose bit off
by a Saigon whore.

08:59.486 --> 09:02.420
You bastard!

09:04.090 --> 09:07.216
I'm just messin' with you, Jimmy.
I saw you down there.

09:07.291 --> 09:09.656
Get Jimmy a beer on me.

09:09.726 --> 09:11.920
Okay. It's okay.

09:13.860 --> 09:15.293
Wow, look at her.

09:15.362 --> 09:17.591
Yeah. She's all yours, buddy.
Go get her.

09:27.034 --> 09:30.593
Hi. How ya doin'?
I'm Sam McKenna.

09:35.205 --> 09:37.331
I live with my dad.

09:37.406 --> 09:41.238
It appears Travis Cole
has bailed out the city once again...

09:41.308 --> 09:45.332
coming up with the necessary funding
to save the Chelsea Opera House.

09:45.409 --> 09:48.536
How could a man in my position
not step in and do his civic duty?

09:48.611 --> 09:50.805
That opera house is part
of this city's heritage.

09:50.878 --> 09:53.403
Heck, yes, I'm gonna keep it up
and running.

09:53.481 --> 09:56.812
I love this city,
and as we all know...

09:56.882 --> 09:59.349
I love opera.

09:59.416 --> 10:00.849
Right, Spunky?

10:00.918 --> 10:04.750
A guy like Travis Cole
has a great life.

10:04.819 --> 10:06.979
Why? Just because he's rich?

10:07.054 --> 10:10.283
No. Because he doesn't take crap
from anybody.

10:10.355 --> 10:12.686
There are two kinds of people in this
world: Those who get stomped on...

10:12.757 --> 10:15.486
and those who do the stomping.

10:15.559 --> 10:17.582
Where'd you come up
with that theory?

10:17.659 --> 10:20.627
That famous guy said it.
What's his name?

10:20.694 --> 10:22.854
Oh, yeah. Jesus.

10:22.929 --> 10:24.589
Hi. I'm Mitch.

10:25.596 --> 10:27.427
Hello, Mitch.

10:27.498 --> 10:30.693
Maybe later you'll drop by the house.

10:30.766 --> 10:33.029
You know, check out the hot tub.

10:33.100 --> 10:36.534
- Hey, pal, beat it!
- Why don't you beat it?

10:36.602 --> 10:40.400
The lady obviously isn't interested
in you, jerk-off! So get lost!

10:40.470 --> 10:43.198
Maybe we should let the lady decide.

10:43.271 --> 10:45.535
- I think you should fight it out.
- Good idea.

10:45.607 --> 10:47.369
- Great idea!
- Brilliant idea!

10:47.441 --> 10:50.966
- I love the idea.
- Terry, Jack, Mike, Rick.

10:51.043 --> 10:54.909
Oh, no. My dumb friend needs me.
I gotta go.

11:00.247 --> 11:03.214
Well, Mitch, looks like
we've got ourselves a fight.

11:03.281 --> 11:06.477
Great. It's fightin' time.
Can I be on their side?

11:08.551 --> 11:11.348
Looks like there's gonna be a brawl.
You playin' something good?

11:11.420 --> 11:15.376
Hell, yeah!
Rolling Stones' "Street Fighting Man."

11:15.454 --> 11:17.978
G-7!

11:19.324 --> 11:21.586
You just hit G-8.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.121
Bring it on!

11:29.561 --> 11:31.552
How come you get a pool cue?

11:34.397 --> 11:36.626
Come on.
You fell right into my trap.

11:36.699 --> 11:39.826
Sammy, bite 'em!
Bite 'em in the nose!

11:46.238 --> 11:49.636
Note to self.
Learn to fight.

11:56.175 --> 11:59.200
I wanna go over there and rip
their heads off, every one of them.

11:59.277 --> 12:04.644
That would probably work, since they're
so tired from beating us mercilessly.

12:04.713 --> 12:08.112
But since we rented the cop uniforms,
let's try it my way, all right?

12:10.249 --> 12:13.216
- Hey, dude, what's up?
- Neil, is that you?

12:13.283 --> 12:16.649
Yeah, it's me, Neil.

12:16.719 --> 12:22.279
It's Jason. We just got back from
beating these guys. Messed 'em up good!

12:22.355 --> 12:26.312
The whole time, this guy's lying there,
crying like a little girl.

12:26.390 --> 12:29.415
- Wait, I'll get Terry.
- Don't get Terry. I mean...

12:29.492 --> 12:31.891
The reason I'm calling is this.

12:31.960 --> 12:35.688
There's these guys going around
to frat houses pretending to be cops.

12:35.761 --> 12:38.820
But they're not real cops.
They're fake cops.

12:38.896 --> 12:41.295
They just robbed a bunch of stuff
from the Delta Psi house.

12:41.365 --> 12:43.298
So don't be fooled, okay?

12:43.366 --> 12:45.299
Sure thing.
Thanks for calling.

12:45.367 --> 12:47.458
Okay, no problem, dude.

12:47.533 --> 12:51.229
Now you go back to doing something
latently homoerotic, all right?

12:58.506 --> 13:02.634
Hello, real cops?
Yes, I'd like to register a complaint.

13:02.708 --> 13:05.539
We got a complaint about the noise.

13:05.609 --> 13:07.735
Whatever you say, Officer.

13:08.711 --> 13:10.303
Officer down! We need backup!

13:20.250 --> 13:22.843
- Okay, we'll take care of these two.
- You got it.

13:23.986 --> 13:26.384
Hey, frat sisters,
remember us?

13:28.321 --> 13:30.414
I'll take this one.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.989
- I'll take the next one.
- All right, man.

13:48.731 --> 13:51.892
That felt great, man,
getting back at those guys tonight.

13:51.966 --> 13:54.559
I've got to admit, that was brilliant,
what you did.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.568
You are the king of revenge.

13:56.635 --> 13:59.966
Pipe down! I'm trying to watch
these broads work out.

14:00.037 --> 14:02.369
- You want another beer?
- Yeah.

14:04.973 --> 14:06.940
Mitch, you wanna come over here?

14:07.007 --> 14:08.997
I'm not falling for that one again.

14:10.542 --> 14:14.340
- I think I'm having a heart attack.
- Not gonna work.

14:17.812 --> 14:21.838
Pops! You all right?

14:31.752 --> 14:34.084
I'm gonna let him sleep.

14:34.155 --> 14:37.315
Could you stay with him
while I find the doctor?

14:37.388 --> 14:39.322
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

14:45.826 --> 14:47.623
I'm glad you came.

14:47.695 --> 14:50.924
Hey, Mr. McKenna.
I'll go get Sam.

14:50.996 --> 14:54.396
No, hold on.
There's something I want to tell you.

14:54.464 --> 14:56.556
Oh. I'm gonna find Sam.

14:56.632 --> 14:59.191
Mitch, sit your ass down!

15:02.802 --> 15:06.099
It's embarrassing being physically
afraid of a hundred-year-old man...

15:06.170 --> 15:08.103
who just had a coronary...

15:08.171 --> 15:10.104
so could we hurry this up?

15:10.172 --> 15:12.435
I'm not doin' too well.

15:12.506 --> 15:15.769
So knowing that, I think
I better tell you this now.

15:16.642 --> 15:19.610
- Tell me what?
- I'm your father.

15:25.246 --> 15:28.805
You must be delirious,
because you're not my father.

15:28.881 --> 15:31.974
I don't know who my father is,
but it's not you.

15:32.050 --> 15:33.710
Here, Mitch.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.744
Look at the picture
in this locket.

15:43.122 --> 15:44.611
Holy Lord!

15:44.689 --> 15:48.919
That's a picture of you and my mom
having sex!

15:48.991 --> 15:52.084
God! Why would you show me that?

15:52.160 --> 15:54.626
I'm sorry, son.

15:54.694 --> 15:57.287
I figured you'd never believe me
unless I showed you that picture.

15:58.296 --> 16:02.594
I loved your mother as a friend, but it
wasn't true love. We both knew that.

16:02.665 --> 16:08.032
Besides, back then they didn't have
these fancy birth control methods.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.795
Like pullin' out.

16:09.868 --> 16:12.063
Oh, God!

16:12.137 --> 16:15.036
Stop sayin' dirty stuff for a second,
would you?

16:17.139 --> 16:19.469
Does Sam know about this?

16:19.539 --> 16:22.098
No. And I don't want you to tell him.

16:22.174 --> 16:23.607
Why not?

16:25.043 --> 16:28.238
I don't want him to feel
he's been lied to his entire life.

16:28.311 --> 16:30.744
Down deep he's very sensitive.

16:30.812 --> 16:32.745
Promise me you won't tell him.

16:32.812 --> 16:35.110
I can't promise you.

16:35.181 --> 16:37.114
Sam's got a right to know.

16:37.182 --> 16:39.171
I'm gonna tell him.

16:39.249 --> 16:41.512
Hello. I'm Dr. Farthing.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.643
Are you Mr. McKenna's son?

16:47.587 --> 16:49.521
I gotta talk to Sam.

16:49.589 --> 16:53.579
Mitch, don't tell him!
Don't you tell him!

16:53.656 --> 16:56.647
Now, let me ask you.

16:56.725 --> 16:59.123
Are you a betting man?

16:59.192 --> 17:01.353
I don't know. Sure.

17:01.428 --> 17:04.758
If someone were taking bets on
your father's bout with death...

17:04.828 --> 17:07.954
I'd bet everything I own on death.

17:08.765 --> 17:11.596
It's a good bet.
The odds are he'll probably die.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.527
Couldn't you have prepared him
for that?

17:15.602 --> 17:17.534
Oh, well...

17:17.602 --> 17:20.593
kind of thought I did
with that betting analogy.

17:20.670 --> 17:22.762
What is wrong with my dad?

17:22.838 --> 17:24.805
Oh, your dad?

17:24.873 --> 17:28.898
In a nut shell,
your dad needs a heart transplant.

17:28.975 --> 17:33.433
Because of his age,
he's low priority on the donor's list.

17:33.511 --> 17:37.103
Was your father a famous athlete
or rock star?

17:37.178 --> 17:41.443
No. He was a boxer,
but he wasn't famous.

17:42.815 --> 17:44.975
Sorry, no heart there.

17:45.049 --> 17:48.073
But, for $600...

17:48.151 --> 17:51.050
I could sell you
a fully-adjustable hospital bed.

17:51.118 --> 17:54.382
Are you crazy?
I don't need a bed.

17:55.989 --> 17:59.184
Playing hardball, are you?
Okay, $550.

17:59.257 --> 18:01.417
I don't have to sit here
and listen to this!

18:01.491 --> 18:02.786
No, wait.

18:02.857 --> 18:05.155
I can't believe this is happening.

18:05.226 --> 18:08.217
Wait. Where're you goin'?
Your friend's leaving...

18:08.294 --> 18:11.057
Come back here. I can help him.

18:12.296 --> 18:14.627
Please, come back, sit down.

18:16.632 --> 18:20.225
I'm sorry.
I'm a compulsive gambler.

18:21.301 --> 18:25.826
Now, I know there's nobody to blame
for this but myself.

18:25.903 --> 18:29.564
I don't know. Maybe the Buffalo Bills,
or the Boston Red Sox or Mr. "T"...

18:29.638 --> 18:31.071
or the Jets.

18:31.139 --> 18:34.834
Mr. "T"? Are you telling me
that you bet on the fight...

18:34.908 --> 18:37.340
in Rocky III,
and you bet against Rocky?

18:37.408 --> 18:40.501
Hindsight is 20l20, my friend.

18:40.577 --> 18:42.703
The point is, I'm in trouble.

18:44.145 --> 18:47.705
Deep trouble. Which could be good
for Mr. McKenna's father.

18:47.781 --> 18:52.147
There is a way I can get his name bumped
to the top of the list to get his heart.

18:52.216 --> 18:54.241
How?

18:58.019 --> 19:00.317
If you pay me $50,000.

19:00.387 --> 19:02.854
- Did you say $50,000?
- No.

19:02.922 --> 19:06.378
I whispered $50,000.
I need it in two weeks.

19:06.457 --> 19:11.051
This is awful, but I've given these
bookies practically everything I have.

19:14.527 --> 19:18.655
When I was young, my mom used to tell me
that the lights we see in the sky...

19:18.729 --> 19:21.662
are from stars that burned out
millions of years ago.

19:21.730 --> 19:23.856
It's like life.

19:23.932 --> 19:28.299
Something can be one way you think
all your life...

19:28.367 --> 19:31.096
and in reality
it's completely different.

19:32.037 --> 19:33.366
Yeah.

19:33.436 --> 19:36.336
I'm gonna kill you, asshole!

19:36.405 --> 19:39.430
Sam, are you pissing
off the side of the building?

19:39.507 --> 19:40.938
Sort of.

19:41.807 --> 19:47.572
You know, I'm going crazy here
over Pops. He's gonna die!

19:47.643 --> 19:50.372
He's not gonna die. You're gonna get
the money and get him a heart.

19:50.445 --> 19:53.378
$50,000 in two weeks?
Come on!

19:53.446 --> 19:56.846
My sister Carol said she'd send
two grand. Where will I get the rest?

19:56.915 --> 20:00.610
- Are you gonna not try?
- Of course I'm gonna try!

20:02.184 --> 20:05.516
What if I got a job?

20:05.587 --> 20:07.712
Maybe I could pay this guy off
in installments.

20:07.787 --> 20:11.017
Yes. Now you're talkin'.
I'll help you every step of the way.

20:12.389 --> 20:14.083
Thanks, buddy.

20:16.925 --> 20:18.358
You little bastards!

20:18.427 --> 20:20.359
That was a hell of a piss.

20:21.827 --> 20:23.761
Look at the "help wanted" section.

20:23.829 --> 20:27.353
I'm looking at the "buy and sell" ads.
Maybe we can sell something.

20:27.430 --> 20:30.262
- Just look for a job.
- All right, all right!

20:30.332 --> 20:31.855
Movie line comin' up.

20:39.536 --> 20:42.561
How's that lookin', baby?

20:55.245 --> 20:57.405
He was supposed to keep drivin'.

21:00.113 --> 21:03.445
To start with,
the bottom stair is a roundover.

21:03.516 --> 21:06.176
It does a 180 into the newel post.

21:06.250 --> 21:10.843
The bannister has a 90 degree easement
and dies into the newel post.

21:10.918 --> 21:13.579
Ninety degrees.

21:13.653 --> 21:16.314
- That's gonna be a problem.
- What's the problem?

21:16.388 --> 21:20.550
We lied on our resumes.
We know nothing about construction.

21:20.624 --> 21:22.318
When is lunch?

21:22.391 --> 21:23.823
You're fired.

21:24.992 --> 21:27.926
Ass-bite, you sure this is a good idea?

21:27.994 --> 21:30.961
Hell, yeah.
It's 50 bucks for eatin' brownies.

21:31.028 --> 21:34.053
They are safe, but there is a chance
of some side effects...

21:34.130 --> 21:39.122
including mild itching, nausea, chills,
hallucinations and rashes.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.759
These are good?
Aren't they good?

21:48.137 --> 21:50.604
I think I feel a slight itch.

21:51.872 --> 21:53.499
No, maybe not.

21:54.374 --> 21:56.534
Could be my imagination.

22:09.347 --> 22:13.715
We eat the pig and
then together we burn.

22:15.751 --> 22:19.584
- What you talkin' about, Satan?
- Come with me.

22:19.654 --> 22:23.747
You belong with me.

22:23.821 --> 22:25.754
Burn!

22:32.860 --> 22:37.521
The hell with that job.
Who wants to be itchy anyway?

22:38.595 --> 22:41.994
All right. Everybody line up.

22:42.063 --> 22:44.826
Don't be dummies.
Just get in line.

22:44.898 --> 22:46.330
That's fine.

22:46.399 --> 22:50.925
Gentlemen, members of the national
office are coming here tonight...

22:51.001 --> 22:54.025
for their annual inspection
of this theater.

22:54.102 --> 22:57.627
Right now, I'm going to explain to you
my managing style...

22:57.704 --> 23:00.967
for the benefit of the new guys.

23:03.174 --> 23:05.801
So there you are, tubby.

23:05.876 --> 23:08.138
You look like a bucket of lard
on a bad day.

23:08.209 --> 23:09.766
You baby gorilla.

23:09.843 --> 23:12.003
Why don't you work the zoo
and stop bothering people?

23:12.078 --> 23:14.773
Got a call yesterday
from Baskin Robbins.

23:14.846 --> 23:19.144
They said that they're down
to only five flavors.

23:19.215 --> 23:21.443
You're swelling up as I talk to you.

23:21.516 --> 23:23.608
Look at you. How's this?
How's it doin'?

23:25.886 --> 23:28.546
Hello, ice cream.
Having a good time running around?

23:31.188 --> 23:35.122
Are you laughing 'cause I called your
friend a fat pig? Think that's funny?

23:35.189 --> 23:38.282
I was laughing earlier
when you were talking to his belly.

23:38.358 --> 23:42.019
Why don't you get a horse and live
in the mountains? Don't bother anybody.

23:42.093 --> 23:44.185
You've got a personality
like a dead moth.

23:44.261 --> 23:47.319
Okay, the fun's over.

23:47.395 --> 23:50.295
Anybody messes this thing up
for me tonight is through.

23:50.364 --> 23:53.854
Not only are you fired,
your life is over.

23:53.932 --> 23:58.492
I'll see to it you never work again, and
wind up tearing tickets off in Kuwait.

24:00.302 --> 24:01.734
Everybody's sucking sand.

24:01.803 --> 24:03.964
Nobody messes up,
understand me?

24:04.038 --> 24:06.732
Don't mess up!

24:10.674 --> 24:12.641
That guy's gonna be our boss?

24:12.709 --> 24:16.438
After a speech like that, how does
he expect us not to screw him over?

24:16.510 --> 24:19.568
Every one of us said the same thing
our first day working for Hamilton...

24:19.645 --> 24:21.578
only nobody does anything.

24:21.646 --> 24:25.011
Trust me, this isn't just talk.
Nobody screws me over like that.

24:25.081 --> 24:27.844
- Me, neither.
- I can't help you. I need this job.

24:27.916 --> 24:30.907
But if you really screw over Hamilton,
I'll give you ten bucks.

24:30.985 --> 24:33.713
Mark me down for $20.

24:33.785 --> 24:36.116
Mr. Witherspoon.

24:36.187 --> 24:38.586
Class operation, Hamilton.
Good job.

24:38.655 --> 24:42.089
Thank you.
Let me get you some refreshments.

24:43.725 --> 24:45.315
Okay, we're all set.

24:45.391 --> 24:48.188
One, two, three. Look away!

24:56.831 --> 24:58.354
Look, an alien.

24:58.431 --> 25:01.490
Yeah, we better have sex
with each other.

25:07.336 --> 25:10.928
Note to self.
Sam just looked at the screen.

25:11.004 --> 25:13.631
No, I didn't.
I was just making sure the reel had...

25:14.740 --> 25:19.436
- This alien looks like a hot guy.
- Right. We better have sex with him.

25:19.508 --> 25:23.203
Gimme that.
It took long enough, you dummy.

25:34.049 --> 25:36.516
Hamilton, you're through.

25:38.318 --> 25:42.218
That was amazing.
You should do that stuff for a living.

25:45.421 --> 25:46.854
Sam, tonight...

25:46.922 --> 25:49.912
we made a wad of cash for doing
something that comes natural to us.

25:49.990 --> 25:51.684
Revenge.

25:51.758 --> 25:54.351
We should open
a "revenge for hire" business.

25:54.426 --> 25:57.120
I've never heard of
a "revenge for hire" business.

25:57.193 --> 25:59.127
Exactly. We'd be the first.

25:59.195 --> 26:02.185
With every genius business idea,
there's got to be a first.

26:02.263 --> 26:05.753
Like the guy who first thought
of delivering pizza to people's houses.

26:05.831 --> 26:07.765
Or the guy who invented crack.

26:09.333 --> 26:11.857
Who's gonna hire us?

26:11.934 --> 26:14.527
I have a feeling people are going
to pay us a lot of money...

26:14.602 --> 26:16.536
to do their dirty work.

26:19.606 --> 26:22.664
Okay, let's get a few things
straight here.

26:22.740 --> 26:27.232
As long as the rent's on time,
you don't wreck the place, we're okay.

26:27.309 --> 26:28.899
If not...

26:29.910 --> 26:31.900
I punch you in the stomach.

26:31.978 --> 26:36.003
If that ever comes up,
that Sam's department.

26:36.080 --> 26:38.377
Yeah, that's my department.

26:41.015 --> 26:43.278
Good.

26:43.350 --> 26:44.942
Good luck to you.

26:45.018 --> 26:46.450
Thanks.

26:50.020 --> 26:51.453
Mildred!

26:53.388 --> 26:54.854
Wait up.

26:54.922 --> 26:57.288
- Oh, hi, Rich.
- Hi, Mildred.

26:57.358 --> 27:00.791
I guess you forgot my name.
It's not Mildred, it's Kathy.

27:00.858 --> 27:03.383
No, I didn't forget.
You never told me, so I just guessed.

27:03.460 --> 27:07.019
Oh. That's a novel approach.

27:07.095 --> 27:10.655
So, how'd the fight with
those fraternity guys turn out?

27:10.731 --> 27:12.322
We kicked their ass!

27:12.398 --> 27:15.593
I was punching one guy
and kicking this other guy.

27:15.666 --> 27:18.031
I threw one dude right through
a plate glass window.

27:18.101 --> 27:21.364
- Really?
- Sort of, except the exact opposite.

27:21.436 --> 27:24.768
Don't you think it's silly
for grown men to fight?

27:24.838 --> 27:28.203
Did you see the movie Kickboxer?
They're all grown men.

27:30.007 --> 27:31.941
Are we going to your apartment now?

27:33.241 --> 27:36.471
I'm going back to work.

27:36.544 --> 27:39.136
- Where do you work?
- Right there.

27:40.345 --> 27:43.711
Phillips Motors!
Are you a dirty car salesman?

27:43.781 --> 27:47.475
- No. I'm a dirty accountant.
- Hey, Kathy!

27:47.549 --> 27:52.745
Break's over, sweetheart.
Get your ass in here! Now!

27:52.818 --> 27:55.911
- Who's that dude?
- Anton Phillips, the owner.

27:55.986 --> 28:00.216
- Does he always talk to you like that?
- Well, yeah.

28:00.289 --> 28:03.815
But he's doing a live TV commercial
tomorrow, so he's worse than usual.

28:05.157 --> 28:08.523
Anyway, it was nice
seeing you again, Mitch.

28:11.060 --> 28:13.493
Live TV commercial?

28:14.496 --> 28:17.430
Okay, settle down, prostitutes.

28:17.498 --> 28:22.296
Understand that you each get $20,
and this requires no sex.

28:22.366 --> 28:24.855
No sex at all...

28:24.934 --> 28:27.129
regardless of what
this character tells you.

28:27.203 --> 28:30.295
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter?

28:30.370 --> 28:34.202
We spend most of the money
my sister sent for Pops on this office.

28:34.272 --> 28:37.296
And now we're wasting the rest of it
so you can impress some girl?

28:37.373 --> 28:40.398
No. This isn't for her.

28:40.476 --> 28:44.103
This is so we can get a free commercial
for Dirty Work on live television.

28:47.712 --> 28:52.010
And in five, four, three, two.

28:52.081 --> 28:54.844
Hello, everyone.
I'm Anton Phillips...

28:54.916 --> 28:57.109
President of Phillips Motors.

28:57.183 --> 29:00.151
We'll return in a moment
to the Channel 11 Movie Matinee...

29:00.219 --> 29:05.882
but I'm here with you live to show you
some great luxury automobiles.

29:05.955 --> 29:09.287
Like this one-year-old
Cadillac Deville...

29:09.356 --> 29:11.550
priced right at $36,000.

29:11.624 --> 29:14.387
Fully loaded:
V-8 engine, standard.

29:14.459 --> 29:17.790
Shock-resistant CD player, standard.

29:17.861 --> 29:19.987
- The trunk looks kinda small.
- This is live!

29:20.062 --> 29:23.655
I'm on live T...
Trunk's fine.

29:23.730 --> 29:27.096
As you can see, friends,
it's not small.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.564
It's a big trunk.
I'll show you right here.

29:29.633 --> 29:31.725
You got a dead hooker in the trunk!

29:31.801 --> 29:33.666
No! It can't be.

29:33.736 --> 29:36.635
- It was. It was a dead hooker.
- It wasn't a dead hooker!

29:36.704 --> 29:39.967
- I know a dead hooker when I see one.
- What's happening?

29:40.038 --> 29:43.494
- Come on down.
- Here's another dead hooker!

29:43.573 --> 29:45.040
What?

29:45.775 --> 29:47.367
Oh, my goodness!

29:47.443 --> 29:52.070
I've never seen so many dead hookers
in all my life.

29:52.145 --> 29:54.339
Lord knows I have.

29:54.412 --> 29:58.471
- I can remember a time...
- Look, there's Mitch on TV.

29:58.548 --> 30:01.242
Yeah, there's Mitch.

30:01.315 --> 30:05.410
And there's the Saigon whore...

30:05.485 --> 30:08.350
that bit my nose off!

30:10.320 --> 30:13.220
These are nice cars.
These are luxury automobiles.

30:13.289 --> 30:16.984
I've got a whole place.
They're fully loaded.

30:17.057 --> 30:19.388
They're loaded
with dead hookers.

30:19.459 --> 30:22.688
You're seein' things.
Don't shoot this.

30:22.760 --> 30:25.819
- This is not part of the commercial.
- Some jerk making your life miserable?

30:25.895 --> 30:29.920
You want revenge? Call 555-0187
and let us do your dirty work.

30:29.997 --> 30:31.555
And we're clear.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.093
Wake up, slut!

30:35.166 --> 30:36.895
Well, well, well.

30:36.967 --> 30:40.128
We meet again.
Nose biter!

30:40.202 --> 30:42.829
Time to pay the fiddler, whore!

30:44.971 --> 30:48.097
That was great.
Let's get out of here.

30:49.173 --> 30:52.266
Nurse, record vital signs, please.

30:52.341 --> 30:55.740
If that stethoscope is as freezing cold
as it was yesterday...

30:55.810 --> 30:57.936
I'm gonna shove it
right up your ass!

30:58.011 --> 31:00.035
Vital signs normal.

31:05.348 --> 31:06.779
Hey, Pops!

31:06.848 --> 31:10.044
Sam! Mitch!
What are you two fruits up to?

31:10.117 --> 31:13.107
You should've seen it.
We just did this cool thing on TV...

31:13.185 --> 31:15.584
that should really help
our revenge business.

31:15.653 --> 31:17.280
We found our calling.

31:17.354 --> 31:21.879
Looking back, I must've been your age
when I found my calling.

31:21.956 --> 31:23.923
So you became a boxer?

31:23.990 --> 31:26.855
That's when I started working
in stag films.

31:28.159 --> 31:30.092
I'm gonna find Dr. Farthing.

31:32.161 --> 31:35.356
Hey, look, Pops.

31:35.429 --> 31:37.761
- I gotta tell you something.
- What?

31:37.832 --> 31:40.856
I've made up my mind.
I'm going to tell Sam.

31:40.933 --> 31:43.400
Or not!

31:43.467 --> 31:46.434
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't tell Sam.

31:46.502 --> 31:48.628
He might react badly.

31:48.703 --> 31:52.637
I wouldn't want anything to break up
our relationship before I die.

31:53.805 --> 31:57.069
Okay, I won't tell him.

31:57.141 --> 31:58.697
Yeah.

32:05.578 --> 32:09.206
Note to self.
Forget about fathering children.

32:12.981 --> 32:16.643
- Any bleeding?
- Only when I sit down.

32:16.717 --> 32:18.650
What happened to your arm?

32:18.717 --> 32:22.447
I'm not sure. It's either
from sleeping on it the wrong way...

32:22.520 --> 32:25.646
or from bookmakers throwing me out
of a speeding car.

32:25.721 --> 32:28.985
- Did you get the 50 grand?
- Not yet.

32:29.057 --> 32:33.286
If we get some money in two weeks,
could we pay the rest in installments?

32:33.358 --> 32:36.757
No. Well, there are nine days left.

32:36.826 --> 32:40.727
Might I suggest kidnapping the child
of a celebrity?

32:40.796 --> 32:45.890
You know, I realize Pops isn't your
favorite person in the whole world...

32:45.965 --> 32:49.263
so I appreciate how hard
you're trying to help him out.

32:49.334 --> 32:50.924
That's nice.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.934
I've gotta tell you something.

32:53.002 --> 32:56.901
Your father is not only your father.

32:58.738 --> 33:01.262
He's also...

33:01.340 --> 33:05.171
He's also a good man.

33:05.241 --> 33:07.175
Your father is a good man.

33:07.243 --> 33:08.902
Yeah.

33:08.976 --> 33:10.466
Mitch, you know...

33:12.511 --> 33:15.774
I wanted to...

33:16.713 --> 33:19.238
You're my best friend, man.

33:19.315 --> 33:21.544
Keep your distance there, Liberace.

33:21.617 --> 33:23.048
I was just...

33:24.751 --> 33:27.218
Hey, Kathy!
I'm glad to see you.

33:27.286 --> 33:31.185
Did you really think you were helping me
with that disgusting stunt?

33:31.254 --> 33:34.620
Hey, maybe you don't realize it,
but that disgusting stunt...

33:34.688 --> 33:37.155
was this idiot's way of saying
he likes you.

33:39.525 --> 33:41.616
I'm gonna stand over there.

33:42.926 --> 33:44.757
The guy deserved it.

33:44.828 --> 33:47.954
Because of what you did,
Anton had to sell the dealership.

33:48.029 --> 33:50.861
Now I'm out of a job.
Did I deserve that?

33:50.931 --> 33:54.455
No, but you shouldn't work for a guy
who treats you bad anyway.

33:54.531 --> 33:59.160
That is a decision for me to make,
not you or your awful company.

33:59.235 --> 34:01.793
Putting prostitutes
in the trunks of cars?

34:01.869 --> 34:04.837
- That is so...
- Cool!

34:04.905 --> 34:07.701
The dead hooker in the trunk thing
was the coolest thing ever.

34:08.772 --> 34:10.933
Wow, Mitch, congratulations.

34:11.007 --> 34:13.998
Now you're famous for being a jerk.

34:14.074 --> 34:16.975
I wish some girl would look at me
the way she looks at you.

34:17.043 --> 34:18.976
What are you talking about?
She hates me.

34:19.045 --> 34:21.443
No, she's mad at you.
There's a difference.

34:21.512 --> 34:24.480
She's mad at you
because she likes you so much.

34:24.547 --> 34:28.504
I'm short, not invisible.
Can I get a little help down here?

34:28.583 --> 34:31.710
Heather, who works here,
is an abusive drunk.

34:31.784 --> 34:35.013
Calls me names. Hits me.
Your classic dwarf hater.

34:35.085 --> 34:37.018
Here she comes.

34:38.454 --> 34:40.387
Move over, short stuff.

34:41.688 --> 34:46.350
Hey, baby, you ever had a chick
with a beard before?

34:46.424 --> 34:48.824
I can't say that I have,
bearded broad.

34:48.893 --> 34:52.190
Then, sugar, you haven't lived.

34:54.496 --> 34:57.794
Note to self.
I don't want to live.

34:59.197 --> 35:01.164
I'll be in my trailer, honey.

35:01.232 --> 35:05.167
If you want it,
come and get it.

35:07.535 --> 35:10.002
Does that go for me, too?

35:11.271 --> 35:13.237
So can you help me?

35:13.305 --> 35:15.636
Yeah, we can help you.

35:36.917 --> 35:38.712
No beard.

35:38.784 --> 35:41.251
My problem is with
these guys next door.

35:41.319 --> 35:44.980
They drive around in their Porsche
90 miles an hour where my kids play...

35:45.054 --> 35:46.487
blasting their music.

35:46.555 --> 35:50.353
They have loud, wild parties
still going on when I get up for work.

35:50.424 --> 35:52.947
- Sounds awful.
- It's unbearable.

35:53.024 --> 35:55.390
It's unbearable to live next door
to that house.

35:56.360 --> 36:00.089
Then we'll make it unbearable
to live in that house.

36:06.865 --> 36:08.388
This should do it.

36:08.466 --> 36:11.524
Oh, Mitch, this is brutal.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.567
We hide these fish
all over the house?

36:13.635 --> 36:15.569
And they'll stink for days.

36:15.637 --> 36:17.694
Okay, let's go.

36:36.146 --> 36:38.079
Come on, quick.

36:39.348 --> 36:41.316
My flight doesn't leave for an hour.

36:42.515 --> 36:45.210
- Nice place you've got.
- Yeah, yeah.

36:52.054 --> 36:53.645
You want it?

36:53.722 --> 36:55.155
Check it out.

36:56.090 --> 36:57.522
Looks good.

37:00.459 --> 37:01.891
What's the problem?

37:02.859 --> 37:04.292
Smells like fish.

37:04.361 --> 37:06.590
What was that? Some sort of signal?

37:06.662 --> 37:08.628
Is that a signal?
You wearing a wire?

37:08.695 --> 37:10.924
No. It really does smell
like fish in here.

37:10.997 --> 37:13.124
You're a damn cop! That's it.

37:13.199 --> 37:15.665
Show these guys what we do to cops.

37:15.733 --> 37:18.200
Say hello to the devil for me.

37:18.267 --> 37:19.699
Behind you!

37:21.736 --> 37:24.636
I've been hit. Kill them!

37:24.704 --> 37:26.193
Kill them!

37:26.271 --> 37:29.705
Make your gun fight
like the devil himself!

37:29.773 --> 37:33.139
Burn in hell, you bastards!

37:33.209 --> 37:36.267
Oh, sweet Jesus! He got me.

37:36.343 --> 37:41.277
Mark, over there. Grab it.
I use it to cut firewood.

37:42.646 --> 37:46.774
What's he using? You're killing me
with that chain saw!

37:50.350 --> 37:54.784
He took away my chain saw,
and now he's using it on me.

37:57.387 --> 38:00.218
My, God! Is that a hand grenade?

38:14.029 --> 38:15.461
Good Lord!

38:15.529 --> 38:19.588
We gotta get out of here.
Will you come on?

38:27.835 --> 38:30.894
That's it!
This noise has got to stop!

38:33.004 --> 38:36.302
Oh, my God.
I never asked you to do this.

38:36.373 --> 38:38.670
Ed, we gotta go.

38:38.741 --> 38:40.798
Could you pay us now?

38:40.875 --> 38:44.571
Four hundred bucks, and we need
$50,000 in six days?

38:44.644 --> 38:48.271
- We're not even close.
- I know we're not.

38:48.980 --> 38:51.072
There's a message.

38:51.148 --> 38:53.080
Maybe it's a job.

38:53.782 --> 38:56.215
Hey, fatso. Fatso!

38:56.283 --> 39:00.081
It's me, Hamilton, your boss
from the movie theater.

39:00.152 --> 39:02.312
I saw that TV commercial you made.

39:02.386 --> 39:06.752
Fat, fat, fat! When you sweat,
marbles come off your ass.

39:13.858 --> 39:15.848
Hello. Dirty Work.

39:17.394 --> 39:21.452
No, I can hear you fine.
It must be your phone.

39:22.696 --> 39:24.252
Sure, we'll be right over.

39:32.401 --> 39:36.358
So this whole block will become a
parking lot for the Chelsea Opera House?

39:36.437 --> 39:39.768
Yep, to make sure none
of Travis Cole's friends...

39:39.838 --> 39:42.897
have to park their Mercedes
on the street.

39:42.973 --> 39:45.838
I've lived in this house for 62 years.

39:45.908 --> 39:48.341
Now the bulldozers
are coming tomorrow.

39:50.209 --> 39:54.372
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- No, no. I have a plan.

40:10.886 --> 40:12.820
What do you make of this?

40:12.888 --> 40:16.150
Either it's a trick and we're walking
into a huge ambush...

40:16.222 --> 40:20.555
or this is the single, dumbest act
in the history of crime.

40:33.199 --> 40:35.132
How we gonna get out of here?

40:35.200 --> 40:38.258
We can't make bail.
Pops is gonna die.

40:38.334 --> 40:40.767
We're gonna be left here to rot.

40:40.836 --> 40:45.065
I'm not worried about the rotting now,
I'm worried about something else.

40:45.137 --> 40:47.571
What else is there to worry about?

40:47.639 --> 40:51.037
We're in prison with prisoners.

40:51.107 --> 40:52.938
So what?

40:53.008 --> 40:56.702
So what? You know what prisoners do
to each other all the time.

40:56.776 --> 40:59.108
No. What?

40:59.178 --> 41:00.940
You don't know?

41:01.012 --> 41:03.342
No!

41:03.413 --> 41:04.846
They...

41:16.553 --> 41:17.985
I never heard that.

41:18.054 --> 41:20.248
You never heard that?

41:20.322 --> 41:22.255
How could you have never
heard of that?

41:22.323 --> 41:24.916
That's what prisons
are most famous for.

41:27.492 --> 41:28.924
All right, let's go.

41:30.660 --> 41:33.093
Not you, tubby.

41:33.162 --> 41:35.390
You sure you don't want him, too?

41:37.630 --> 41:41.758
The popcorn in the bulldozer stunt
was allegedly perpetrated by these men:

41:41.832 --> 41:43.992
Mitchell Weaver
and Samuel McKenna.

41:44.067 --> 41:46.932
But was this
a dangerous act of mischief...

41:47.001 --> 41:50.492
or a heroic example
of civil disobedience?

41:50.570 --> 41:53.799
Those two boys sure are heroes to me.

41:53.872 --> 41:58.330
If Mitch Weaver and Sam McKenna
are heroes, then who's the villain?

41:58.407 --> 42:01.533
Many would say that would be
the builder of the parking lot...

42:01.609 --> 42:05.305
millionaire real estate mogul,
Travis Co...

42:05.378 --> 42:08.833
Damn it. That looks bad.
We've got to stop the hemorrhaging.

42:08.912 --> 42:11.437
Martin, could you wait outside?

42:11.515 --> 42:14.004
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry about what happened.

42:14.082 --> 42:16.777
It's all right, Martin.
It wasn't your fault.

42:20.484 --> 42:23.044
By the end of the day, I'd like Martin
jobless, homeless...

42:23.120 --> 42:26.019
penniless and hairless.

42:33.191 --> 42:36.125
You fellows have a lot of growing up
to do, I'll tell you that.

42:36.193 --> 42:39.126
Ridiculous!
Completely ridiculous!

42:40.395 --> 42:44.159
Can you believe these characters?
Way out of line!

42:44.230 --> 42:47.686
Have a good mind
to go to the warden about this.

42:47.765 --> 42:51.200
The lack of respect
hurts the most.

42:51.267 --> 42:52.858
That's what hurts the most.

42:52.934 --> 42:56.164
Except for the other thing.
That hurts the most.

42:56.236 --> 42:59.863
But the lack of respect
hurts the second most.

42:59.938 --> 43:02.701
Weaver, McKenna,
you're free to go.

43:06.841 --> 43:08.274
Ridiculous!

43:11.177 --> 43:13.303
First of all,
Mrs. Murphy is owed...

43:13.378 --> 43:16.778
my deepest apologies for the hardships
she's unjustly suffered.

43:16.847 --> 43:22.282
Secondly, all charges have been dropped
against Mr. Weaver and Mr. McKenna...

43:22.349 --> 43:24.872
who are not criminals
but heroes.

43:24.950 --> 43:27.611
In fact, all of us are going out
for popcorn.

43:28.519 --> 43:30.883
Okay, Spunky,
you can come too.

43:32.454 --> 43:35.422
I think he's got his thumb
up that dog's ass.

43:35.490 --> 43:38.286
Gentlemen, I think I have a job for you.

43:40.225 --> 43:45.057
Mitch, Sam, considering your recent
exploits as mischief makers...

43:45.127 --> 43:47.856
I think you may be able to help me.

43:47.929 --> 43:53.489
There's a small walk-up building
I own over at 99 Franklin Street.

43:53.565 --> 43:57.431
It's low-income housing.
My way of giving back to the community.

43:57.500 --> 44:00.627
But much to my chagrin,
the criminal element...

44:00.702 --> 44:04.136
has reared its ugly head
in the form of drug dealers, gangs...

44:04.204 --> 44:07.297
even a house of prostitution.

44:07.372 --> 44:10.634
He's doing that... Why don't you get
the cops to get them out?

44:10.706 --> 44:12.765
It's not that simple.

44:12.841 --> 44:16.296
As long as those criminals
pay their rent on time...

44:16.375 --> 44:18.935
the police say I have no grounds
to evict them.

44:19.010 --> 44:23.240
- What do you want us to do?
- Get the building condemned.

44:23.313 --> 44:28.010
By any means necessary. That way,
everyone will be evicted legally.

44:28.082 --> 44:31.846
Then I'll fix it up, rent the apartments
to honest, hardworking people.

44:31.917 --> 44:35.612
I don't know. We've never done
anything this big before.

44:35.686 --> 44:38.848
Gentlemen, let me give you
a minute to think it over.

44:40.589 --> 44:42.350
Doesn't it seem like...

44:42.422 --> 44:44.515
He's definitely doing that dog.

44:44.591 --> 44:48.285
Doesn't it seem like we're getting
into something over our heads here?

44:48.358 --> 44:51.258
So, gentlemen, have you decided?

44:52.161 --> 44:54.094
We'll do it...

44:54.162 --> 44:56.958
for $50,000.

44:58.497 --> 45:01.828
Very well.
$50,000 it is.

45:06.335 --> 45:07.767
Good news, Mr. McKenna.

45:07.835 --> 45:10.667
All right, boys!
Bring on the whore!

45:10.737 --> 45:13.000
No, it's not a whore.

45:13.072 --> 45:16.164
We're gonna get you the $50,000
for your heart transplant.

45:16.240 --> 45:17.797
That's good, too.

45:17.873 --> 45:19.999
We don't have the money yet, Pops.

45:20.075 --> 45:23.133
- Yeah, but it's a sure thing.
- Excuse me.

45:23.209 --> 45:25.540
Sam, can I have a word with you?

45:25.611 --> 45:28.272
- Sure.
- Thank you.

45:28.346 --> 45:31.280
Wait. You didn't tell him, did ya?

45:33.181 --> 45:34.772
Thanks.

45:34.848 --> 45:37.782
But I still want to,
and I can't promise you I won't.

45:39.851 --> 45:43.376
Just getting my photo album.
What are you so jumpy about?

45:44.354 --> 45:48.516
I don't know. Maybe it's your
lifelong pattern of random assault.

45:48.589 --> 45:50.783
Look at this.

45:50.857 --> 45:54.052
That's me fighting for the middleweight
championship of the Golden Gloves.

45:55.659 --> 45:59.286
That's me shaking hands with
Dwight D. Eisenhower, U.S. President.

45:59.361 --> 46:00.622
My goodness!

46:01.929 --> 46:04.522
That's your mom giving me a...

46:04.597 --> 46:06.028
I'm sorry.

46:06.097 --> 46:08.725
That's Sam's mom.

46:09.799 --> 46:12.561
Yeah. Irene.

46:14.504 --> 46:17.903
His blood levels are good.
Should cut down on finger foods.

46:17.972 --> 46:19.905
What happened to your foot?

46:19.973 --> 46:23.600
What I don't understand is,
when you owe a bookie a lot of money...

46:23.674 --> 46:28.132
and he blows off one of your toes,
you still owe him the money.

46:28.210 --> 46:32.234
Doesn't seem fair since he's gonna
kill me in four days anyway.

46:32.311 --> 46:35.507
Mitch says we'll have the money
for you.

46:35.580 --> 46:40.413
Oh, thank God!
I mean, that's good news, Sam.

46:40.483 --> 46:43.007
We just have to get
the building condemned.

46:43.085 --> 46:46.745
We go in, wreck the joint.
Pops is saved.

46:47.653 --> 46:49.280
Did you call him Pops?

47:17.835 --> 47:19.961
What havoc are you planning now?

47:20.036 --> 47:22.299
What are you doing here?

47:23.304 --> 47:25.237
Actually, I was looking for you.

47:25.305 --> 47:28.364
I saw how you and your friend
saved that woman's house.

47:28.441 --> 47:32.705
Guess you can use your powers
for good as well as evil.

47:34.510 --> 47:36.976
I'm on my way
to my grandmother's place.

47:37.044 --> 47:39.204
Do you want to walk me?

47:39.279 --> 47:42.610
Note to self. Mitch was right.

47:42.680 --> 47:44.374
No, he wasn't.

47:44.448 --> 47:46.541
It's too late.
It's already on tape.

47:46.616 --> 47:50.982
I'm glad you finally realized
you should never take crap from anybody.

47:51.051 --> 47:54.178
There's my grandma.
Hi, Grandma.

47:54.253 --> 47:58.347
Your grandmother lives here?
At 99 Franklin Street?

47:58.422 --> 48:01.549
Yep. Grandma,
I'd like you to meet Mitch.

48:01.624 --> 48:05.751
Hi. Kathy's told me about you.
You're a hero.

48:05.826 --> 48:11.056
Well, today I'm a hero. Tomorrow,
who knows? You might both hate me.

48:12.529 --> 48:15.018
Girls, I'm over here.

48:15.097 --> 48:17.963
Excuse me, Mitch.
It was nice meeting you.

48:19.632 --> 48:23.361
Are those prostitutes?
I mean, who are those girls?

48:24.535 --> 48:28.400
They work with my grandmother. She runs
a business out of her apartment.

48:28.470 --> 48:31.563
Sixty years old
and still going strong.

48:31.638 --> 48:34.197
Yeah, I bet she is.

48:34.272 --> 48:36.967
Would you like to come in
for some coffee?

48:37.041 --> 48:41.669
Oh, no. I have to go lift weights.

48:41.743 --> 48:43.175
What?

48:45.946 --> 48:48.412
Okay, some other time, maybe?

48:48.480 --> 48:50.107
That'd be great.

48:50.181 --> 48:52.580
Okay. Bye.

49:07.189 --> 49:10.715
That sweet girl's grandmother
runs a whorehouse...

49:10.792 --> 49:13.156
out of the building
we're about to destroy?

49:13.226 --> 49:16.854
Yeah. I feel awful doing this to Kathy.

49:16.927 --> 49:20.361
Mitch, you're starting to like Kathy,
aren't you?

49:20.429 --> 49:22.828
No!

49:22.897 --> 49:27.229
I know you. When you say no
like that, you mean yes.

49:27.299 --> 49:29.562
- What are you talking about?
- I'll show you.

49:29.634 --> 49:32.601
Did you ever rob a bank?

49:32.668 --> 49:35.795
Did you ever climb Mount Everest?

49:35.871 --> 49:40.271
Did you ever say you could see why
women find Sean Connery sexy?

49:43.508 --> 49:45.498
Okay, so I like Kathy a little.

49:45.575 --> 49:49.703
Man, I hate the fact we have to destroy
her grandmother's building.

49:49.777 --> 49:52.039
- But we have to.
- Yep.

51:39.365 --> 51:42.230
We did it, man!
I can't believe it! Pops lives.

51:42.300 --> 51:45.359
What'd I tell you?
Here's to a brand-new heart.

51:45.435 --> 51:48.732
That's right. I couldn't have done it
without a genius like you.

51:48.803 --> 51:51.066
I couldn't have done it without...

51:52.773 --> 51:55.604
a big oaf to smash down
all the doors like you.

51:55.674 --> 51:57.300
Yeah!

51:58.442 --> 52:00.875
Hey, we should go pick up
our 50 grand.

52:00.944 --> 52:02.910
Good idea.

52:02.977 --> 52:05.274
Hey, is that the building?

52:07.080 --> 52:09.808
Building owner James Kirkpatrick
had little to say.

52:09.881 --> 52:12.678
Kirkpatrick owns that building?

52:12.749 --> 52:17.445
- What happened to the building?
- I have no idea, but I'll find out.

52:17.518 --> 52:20.213
Resident Gladys Waite
lamented the fall of the building.

52:20.286 --> 52:22.275
I don't know what I'll do.

52:22.353 --> 52:26.288
I've been running a sewing business
out of my apartment for 30 years.

52:26.356 --> 52:28.185
Sewing business?

52:28.256 --> 52:32.749
Tenants are staying at a local shelter.
But what about the condemned building?

52:32.826 --> 52:35.850
Unfortunately, I'll have to level it.

52:35.927 --> 52:39.293
Enough boring talk. I want to talk
about my true passion...

52:39.363 --> 52:42.091
which is the grand reopening
of the opera house.

52:42.164 --> 52:45.098
All proceeds go to benefit
the homeless.

52:45.166 --> 52:49.896
You know how I feel about the homeless.
They're human beings and have no homes.

52:59.540 --> 53:01.472
May I help you gentlemen?

53:01.540 --> 53:04.337
Mitch Weaver and Sam McKenna
to see Travis Cole.

53:04.408 --> 53:07.569
Mr. Cole said your services
are no longer needed.

53:07.643 --> 53:09.837
No longer...

53:09.911 --> 53:12.776
Fellas, I have an idea.
Get Mr. Cole on the phone...

53:12.845 --> 53:14.607
I have a better idea.

53:14.679 --> 53:17.476
Why don't we kick
every one of your asses...

53:17.548 --> 53:20.709
and then go upstairs
and kick Cole's ass, too?

53:30.455 --> 53:32.717
All right, I screwed up.

53:32.788 --> 53:35.551
What do we do now?

53:38.992 --> 53:40.424
Homeless guys.

53:41.493 --> 53:46.723
I'll give you a dollar each if you run
into this building and yell and scream.

53:46.795 --> 53:50.355
That's very nice,
but I think what you need...

53:50.431 --> 53:53.865
are like some psycho,
out-of-control homeless guys.

53:53.933 --> 53:57.299
We're more the broken, spiritless...

53:57.369 --> 54:00.336
"I've lost the will to live" type
homeless guys.

54:00.402 --> 54:02.734
How about for two dollars?

54:21.013 --> 54:24.003
Mitch, Sam, what a pleasant surprise.

54:24.080 --> 54:26.980
- Where's our money?
- What money?

54:27.049 --> 54:30.142
You owe us $50,000 for getting the
building on Franklin Street condemned.

54:30.217 --> 54:31.809
We want it now.

54:31.885 --> 54:34.944
But I don't even own the building
on Franklin.

54:35.520 --> 54:39.284
I told you I did, but I lied.
Good luck trying to prove it.

54:39.355 --> 54:40.788
Son of a bitch!

54:40.856 --> 54:44.084
Once you stopped my bulldozer
from leveling that old lady's house...

54:44.157 --> 54:46.387
I couldn't let you get away with it.

54:46.459 --> 54:50.517
So I figured out a way for you to
help me and hurt you at the same time.

54:50.593 --> 54:53.527
I guess I showed you guys something
about dirty work.

54:53.595 --> 54:57.120
Whatever. But we're not leaving
without our 50 grand.

55:04.667 --> 55:08.033
When you jumped on that guard's back
and yelled...

55:08.103 --> 55:11.298
"The CIA put a chip in my brain"...

55:11.371 --> 55:15.067
I was laughing so hard
I almost shit my pants.

55:15.140 --> 55:17.299
Almost?

55:20.743 --> 55:22.902
Thanks. That was fun.

55:22.976 --> 55:25.307
More fun than working for Cole.

55:26.646 --> 55:29.670
- You worked for Cole?
- All of us have.

55:30.814 --> 55:32.406
I had a life...

55:32.482 --> 55:36.848
a house, cars,
respect in the community.

55:36.917 --> 55:39.612
Suddenly it was all taken away.

55:39.685 --> 55:43.141
I finally realized
just how low I'd sunk.

55:43.220 --> 55:45.949
I was at my daughter's soccer game.

55:46.022 --> 55:47.818
She lives with her mom.

55:47.888 --> 55:52.347
I was standing on the sidelines
and a cop asked me to move along.

55:52.425 --> 55:55.119
That's when it hit me.
I'm not even a human.

55:55.193 --> 55:56.625
Here's your $2.

56:05.298 --> 56:08.891
How could you stand outside
my grandmother's home...

56:08.966 --> 56:10.933
the day before you destroyed it?

56:11.000 --> 56:13.695
You're telling me you thought
she was a drug dealer?

56:13.768 --> 56:18.033
- No, I thought she was a whore!
- What is wrong with you?

56:18.104 --> 56:21.196
Look, we made a mistake.

56:21.272 --> 56:23.637
The worst thing is
we didn't even get paid.

56:23.707 --> 56:26.072
The worst thing is
you didn't get paid?

56:26.142 --> 56:30.076
- The reason we needed that money...
- Stop right there.

56:30.144 --> 56:33.578
You drive these people from their homes
and all you care about is money?

56:33.645 --> 56:35.578
I should call the police.

56:35.646 --> 56:39.704
I'm really sorry about what happened,
but listen...

56:39.781 --> 56:43.079
I'm done listening.
Have a nice life.

56:49.520 --> 56:51.578
No, beat it, nurse!

56:52.654 --> 56:55.383
Come back when you're a broad!

56:58.792 --> 57:00.451
Hey, fellas.

57:01.659 --> 57:03.592
Why so glum?

57:03.660 --> 57:08.061
We didn't get the money.
Mr. Sure Thing here was wrong.

57:08.129 --> 57:11.392
I don't know what happened.
I messed up. I'm sorry.

57:11.464 --> 57:12.930
That was easy.

57:12.998 --> 57:18.831
You can chalk this up as a loss
and forget about it. I can't do that.

57:18.901 --> 57:21.733
Pops is my dad.

57:21.803 --> 57:24.396
I'm sorry.
I gotta tell him. Sam...

57:24.471 --> 57:26.733
No. I'll tell him.

57:26.805 --> 57:28.738
Tell me what?

57:30.074 --> 57:32.267
I'm Mitch's father, too.

57:34.176 --> 57:35.369
It's true.

57:35.443 --> 57:39.070
This is no time for one
of your practical jokes.

57:39.144 --> 57:41.441
Show him the locket.

57:41.512 --> 57:42.843
Show me what?

57:50.284 --> 57:52.216
This is Pops...

57:54.052 --> 57:55.712
and your mother!

57:55.786 --> 57:57.615
Yeah, I know.

57:57.686 --> 57:59.347
You cheated on Mom?

57:59.421 --> 58:03.220
No! She was there, too.
Who do you think took the picture?

58:04.657 --> 58:08.956
Wait a minute.
So that makes us...

58:09.027 --> 58:10.856
Brothers.

58:12.361 --> 58:15.022
- You lied to me!
- Pops wouldn't let me tell.

58:15.096 --> 58:17.529
Don't blame him.
You should have told me.

58:17.597 --> 58:20.724
You know how hard that man
can squeeze a pair of balls?

58:20.798 --> 58:22.766
It's not bad that we're brothers.

58:22.834 --> 58:25.027
Sure, for you!
You've got everything.

58:25.101 --> 58:28.194
You're smart, people like you,
you never have to pay for sex.

58:28.270 --> 58:30.429
Pops was the one thing I had
that you didn't.

58:30.503 --> 58:32.970
Now I don't even have that.

58:33.038 --> 58:35.870
Stay away from me, all right?

58:49.712 --> 58:54.205
That was really funny,
siccing the cops on us.

58:54.283 --> 58:56.772
Really?
I thought it was funny...

58:56.850 --> 59:01.115
but I'm surprised you did
because you got your asses kicked.

59:04.820 --> 59:07.788
Things will get better.
Hang in there.

59:07.856 --> 59:09.447
Thanks for listening.

59:11.457 --> 59:12.889
Listen, pal...

59:12.958 --> 59:17.859
you ever need anything,
I mean anything at all...

59:19.261 --> 59:20.694
you come to me.

59:20.763 --> 59:23.229
- Can I stay at your place tonight?
- The thing is this.

59:23.297 --> 59:27.493
I live over at the Y, as you know.

59:29.767 --> 59:34.327
I got a roommate, Old Jack, who is
a little particular about strangers.

59:34.402 --> 59:36.392
No, problem, Jimmy. Thanks.

59:36.469 --> 59:39.335
He just got his knee drained.

59:39.405 --> 59:41.338
I'll find another place.

59:41.406 --> 59:46.603
He needed it, too. That thing
was getting a little bit ripe.

59:46.676 --> 59:49.666
I get the picture.
I'll sleep in my car.

59:49.743 --> 59:52.438
Old Jack's a odd duck, I tell you.

59:54.312 --> 59:58.771
Many times I catch him staring
at me sleeping, which is off-putting.

59:58.848 --> 01:00:01.178
- I guess that would be.
- His feet bleed.

01:00:01.249 --> 01:00:03.182
I don't want to stay at your place!

01:00:03.250 --> 01:00:05.843
Point taken.
Point taken, Mitch.

01:00:24.494 --> 01:00:26.221
Hey, buddy.

01:00:28.162 --> 01:00:30.357
I'm trying to get some sleep
back here.

01:00:51.041 --> 01:00:56.032
Note to self. Remember, no matter
how bad life gets, there is always beer.

01:00:58.944 --> 01:01:01.571
All right, I screwed up.
What do we do now?

01:01:01.646 --> 01:01:03.078
Homeless guys.

01:01:03.146 --> 01:01:06.841
I'll give you a dollar each if you run
into this building and yell and scream.

01:01:06.915 --> 01:01:09.439
I left the recorder on.

01:01:12.751 --> 01:01:15.048
I don't even own the building
on Franklin.

01:01:15.119 --> 01:01:18.575
I told you I did, but I lied.
Good luck trying to prove it.

01:01:18.654 --> 01:01:20.621
Son of a bitch!

01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:26.856
I guess I showed you something
about dirty work.

01:01:32.094 --> 01:01:33.686
What are you doing?

01:01:33.762 --> 01:01:36.229
Getting the money from Cole.

01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:40.962
My tape recorder was running.

01:01:41.032 --> 01:01:44.431
Everything in Cole's office
I got on tape. And I got a great plan.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:48.799
Another plan? Like the plan
that got us here in the first place?

01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:54.567
Look, I know you're mad but I think I know how to
get the $50,000 and save the apartment. I really need your help.

01:01:57.107 --> 01:02:01.804
Look Mitch, a lot of stuff came pouring
out of me at the hospital...

01:02:01.876 --> 01:02:05.503
because I was in shock
about what I just heard.

01:02:05.578 --> 01:02:08.637
How did you feel when you found out?

01:02:08.713 --> 01:02:11.737
I don't know.
At first I felt a little weird.

01:02:11.814 --> 01:02:16.407
But we've always been like brothers.
Now it's just official.

01:02:16.483 --> 01:02:19.007
It's kind of cool.

01:02:19.084 --> 01:02:22.813
I guess it is cool.
But it does change things.

01:02:22.886 --> 01:02:24.182
How?

01:02:24.253 --> 01:02:26.483
Remember in second grade...

01:02:26.555 --> 01:02:30.147
when we used rusty soda can tops
to become blood brothers?

01:02:30.223 --> 01:02:34.852
It was a bunch of trouble for nothing
because we were already brothers.

01:02:35.892 --> 01:02:37.655
Yeah, that's right.

01:02:37.727 --> 01:02:41.422
Hey, remember in fifth grade
when I was under the monkey bars...

01:02:41.496 --> 01:02:43.827
and I peeked at
your sister's underwear?

01:02:43.897 --> 01:02:45.557
Remember that?

01:02:45.631 --> 01:02:48.928
I was sneaking a peek
at my own sister's underwear.

01:02:48.999 --> 01:02:54.492
That's right. And remember
in 12th grade, you had sex with her?

01:02:59.238 --> 01:03:01.932
Okay, enough reminiscing.

01:03:05.141 --> 01:03:06.608
Listen.

01:03:06.675 --> 01:03:10.904
In the past two weeks, I've been
beaten up, thrown out of buildings...

01:03:10.977 --> 01:03:13.945
I've slept in my car,
spent the night in jail...

01:03:14.012 --> 01:03:17.173
And when you were in jail,
those guys...

01:03:17.247 --> 01:03:21.181
The point is, you aren't the only ones
who got screwed over.

01:03:21.249 --> 01:03:24.183
Yes, I made a big mistake
destroying your building...

01:03:24.251 --> 01:03:26.377
but I know how we can get it back.

01:03:26.452 --> 01:03:29.385
Why should we believe you?

01:03:29.453 --> 01:03:33.853
I walked through life believing
the only principle I had to live by...

01:03:33.921 --> 01:03:36.286
was "Don't take crap from anybody."

01:03:36.356 --> 01:03:38.847
Suddenly all that changed.

01:03:38.925 --> 01:03:41.551
Suddenly I was trying to do something
for someone else.

01:03:41.626 --> 01:03:46.027
We were trying to earn $50,000
to get a heart transplant for our dad.

01:03:47.529 --> 01:03:49.359
You two are brothers?

01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:52.023
Yeah, it's a long story.

01:03:52.098 --> 01:03:54.030
My dad boned his mom.

01:03:54.098 --> 01:03:56.032
Okay, it's a short story.

01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:00.895
I'm saying that when you're doing it
for someone else...

01:04:00.968 --> 01:04:04.459
it's not just revenge,
it's standing up for yourself.

01:04:04.538 --> 01:04:08.232
That's why I'm asking all of us
to stand up for ourselves.

01:04:08.305 --> 01:04:13.366
Travis Cole screwed all of us.
I say we fight back. Are you with me?

01:04:17.177 --> 01:04:21.976
Are you with me based on the guarantee
that if I'm wrong, you can kick my ass?

01:04:26.247 --> 01:04:30.410
I understand how upset you were
when you found out what we did.

01:04:30.484 --> 01:04:32.416
I want to thank you
for going along with us.

01:04:32.484 --> 01:04:35.975
I promise you'll get your building back.

01:04:36.053 --> 01:04:37.485
Okay, Mitch.

01:04:39.455 --> 01:04:42.423
Don't screw me over again.
I mean it.

01:04:44.758 --> 01:04:46.690
Why didn't he punch you, too?

01:04:46.758 --> 01:04:48.657
I have no idea.

01:04:49.693 --> 01:04:54.753
Deciding to fight back against Cole
is turning things around for me.

01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:59.991
Travis Cole is empty inside, so he has
to make everyone around him empty.

01:05:00.064 --> 01:05:04.124
That's what he did to me.
But I'm not empty anymore.

01:05:04.201 --> 01:05:07.862
I'm filled with something,
filled with purpose...

01:05:07.936 --> 01:05:11.267
filled with hope,
filled with dignity.

01:05:11.337 --> 01:05:13.270
It's all thanks to you g...

01:05:14.572 --> 01:05:16.403
Guys?

01:05:16.474 --> 01:05:18.906
Guys, wait up.

01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:28.803
How you doin'? I got a delivery
of some opera costumes here.

01:05:28.878 --> 01:05:31.607
- What's the company name?
- Company name?

01:05:36.716 --> 01:05:38.306
Very clever.

01:05:47.354 --> 01:05:49.287
These brownies are great.

01:05:51.957 --> 01:05:55.721
Let's go, prostitutes, homeless guys.
Shake a leg.

01:05:55.792 --> 01:05:58.520
Come on, haven't got all day.
Let's go.

01:05:58.593 --> 01:06:01.459
Good Lord! I'm in whore heaven!

01:06:10.199 --> 01:06:12.291
What are they watching?

01:06:12.366 --> 01:06:14.698
In this corner, weighing in...

01:06:14.769 --> 01:06:17.736
at 225 pounds...

01:06:17.803 --> 01:06:21.828
the former heavyweight champion
of the world...

01:06:21.905 --> 01:06:23.769
Kenny Norton!

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:28.206
And his opponent Gary Coleman!

01:06:30.809 --> 01:06:34.244
Come on, man, bring it! Bring it!

01:06:42.215 --> 01:06:43.807
Well, here we are.

01:06:45.183 --> 01:06:48.947
Building tenants, you'll be serving
as the ushers and ticket takers.

01:06:49.018 --> 01:06:52.214
So take one of those,
and Kathy will tell you what to do.

01:06:52.287 --> 01:06:55.049
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I don't know why I'm here.

01:06:55.121 --> 01:06:59.920
Why are you here? Wait, I remember.
Intense physical attraction to me.

01:07:04.227 --> 01:07:05.853
What's the trouble, sir?

01:07:05.927 --> 01:07:11.021
My costume is not here. I cannot go
on a stage without my costume.

01:07:11.096 --> 01:07:14.689
Relax. I will track down
your costume personally.

01:07:14.764 --> 01:07:19.426
By the way, you're a fat guy.
Would you care for a brownie?

01:07:20.534 --> 01:07:23.764
Excuse me, coming through.
Pardon me.

01:07:23.836 --> 01:07:27.099
Excuse me. Sorry.
Coming through here.

01:07:27.171 --> 01:07:31.503
I know I must really smell.
Plus, I farted. Coming through.

01:07:31.573 --> 01:07:34.904
Joining me, the man responsible
for this glorious event...

01:07:34.975 --> 01:07:37.306
real estate mogul Travis Cole.

01:07:37.376 --> 01:07:41.037
Thank you. I'm proud of two things
about tonight's event.

01:07:41.111 --> 01:07:45.910
First, all proceeds from the opera
will go to benefit the homeless.

01:07:45.981 --> 01:07:50.177
And secondly, I personally oversaw
every aspect of this production.

01:07:50.250 --> 01:07:53.342
And I believe it will be known
as the finest staging...

01:07:53.417 --> 01:07:56.112
of Don Giovanni ever presented.

01:07:56.186 --> 01:07:58.813
Excuse me, coming through.

01:08:00.621 --> 01:08:03.748
Hey, did you fart? Oh, I think
that was me from before. Sorry.

01:08:03.823 --> 01:08:05.755
Excuse me, coming through.

01:08:05.823 --> 01:08:09.087
Fellas, you've heard the old saying:

01:08:09.158 --> 01:08:12.819
"In the land of the blind,
a man with one eye is king."

01:08:12.894 --> 01:08:15.726
Well, today, in the land
of the skunks...

01:08:15.795 --> 01:08:18.421
the man with half a nose is king.

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:25.921
Hello, everyone.

01:08:30.002 --> 01:08:32.731
I'm your mayor, Adrian Riggins.
Thank you.

01:08:32.803 --> 01:08:35.737
Before tonight's performance
of Don Giovanni...

01:08:35.805 --> 01:08:39.533
let's take a moment to recognize the man
that made this night possible...

01:08:39.607 --> 01:08:44.541
the best friend this city
has ever had, Travis Cole.

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:54.613
Enjoy the opera, everyone.

01:09:15.225 --> 01:09:16.817
What the...

01:09:19.394 --> 01:09:22.453
Wow! Get a load
of that mountain range.

01:09:23.461 --> 01:09:25.224
Come back, baby.

01:09:27.131 --> 01:09:30.564
This is the most daring portrayal
of Don Giovanni I've ever seen.

01:09:30.631 --> 01:09:34.328
Let's go. Time for Pops
to climb that mountain.

01:09:34.402 --> 01:09:35.834
What's up, fruity?

01:09:35.902 --> 01:09:39.495
How did you... It doesn't matter.
You'll be gone in a minute.

01:09:39.569 --> 01:09:43.265
Aha! You didn't count on
my loyal army of prostitutes, did you?

01:09:45.439 --> 01:09:46.929
What do you want?

01:09:47.006 --> 01:09:50.064
Just relax. Let's watch
your dirty opera.

01:09:50.142 --> 01:09:52.575
You're a hell of a woman, baby.

01:09:52.643 --> 01:09:55.838
Let me take you to Vegas.
You know what they say.

01:09:55.911 --> 01:09:58.879
It ain't over till the fat lady
checks into a hotel with Pops.

01:09:58.947 --> 01:10:02.381
What are you doing?
You're ruining Don Giovanni.

01:10:02.448 --> 01:10:05.143
Don Giovanni?
Who's that dude?

01:10:05.216 --> 01:10:07.206
The opera.
You're ruining the opera.

01:10:07.284 --> 01:10:11.480
Oh, the opera. Yes, we are ruining that.
Sam, now!

01:10:11.553 --> 01:10:14.112
You got it, buddy!

01:10:14.188 --> 01:10:18.713
Sing the song, boys!

01:10:20.091 --> 01:10:24.957
Bow, and kneel before me!

01:10:29.595 --> 01:10:32.154
Jimmy! Release the skunks.

01:10:32.230 --> 01:10:34.753
Okay, I got it. I'm on it.

01:10:34.831 --> 01:10:37.856
Don't let me down, boys.

01:10:37.933 --> 01:10:41.025
Run. Fly. Fly away.

01:10:41.101 --> 01:10:44.967
Run! Run out! Fly!

01:10:45.036 --> 01:10:46.469
Fly!

01:10:51.273 --> 01:10:55.832
Skunks used to heighten the atmosphere
of squalor and despair. Brilliant!

01:11:04.046 --> 01:11:06.945
Oh, the cameras are here.

01:11:07.014 --> 01:11:08.947
By the way, Travis...

01:11:09.015 --> 01:11:11.539
remember when you said this?

01:11:11.616 --> 01:11:17.142
Note to self. Making love to blowup doll
not as good as advertised.

01:11:18.354 --> 01:11:22.151
Sorry. I must have gone too far.

01:11:22.221 --> 01:11:23.654
I'll just...

01:11:24.889 --> 01:11:27.322
I don't even own the building
on Franklin.

01:11:27.391 --> 01:11:30.756
I told you I did, but I lied.
Good luck trying to prove it.

01:11:30.826 --> 01:11:32.453
Son of a bitch!

01:11:32.527 --> 01:11:36.358
I bet those reporters would love
to get hold of this tape.

01:11:38.697 --> 01:11:40.663
How much do you want?

01:11:40.731 --> 01:11:43.221
All I want is the $50,000
you owe us.

01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:44.789
$50,000.

01:11:44.867 --> 01:11:47.856
Make it out to Dr. Farthing.

01:11:47.934 --> 01:11:50.402
Kirkpatrick.

01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:52.732
Kirkpatrick is going to punch you
in the stomach.

01:11:52.803 --> 01:11:54.736
Here you go.

01:11:57.906 --> 01:11:59.838
You'll sign this contract...

01:11:59.906 --> 01:12:03.341
that gives back ownership
of 99 Franklin Street to Kirkpatrick.

01:12:03.409 --> 01:12:06.205
Give it here.

01:12:06.276 --> 01:12:09.335
Thanks, Mitch.
I'm glad I didn't have to punch you.

01:12:09.412 --> 01:12:11.345
Me too, buddy.

01:12:12.713 --> 01:12:16.011
Okay, Cole, it's been nice
doing business with you.

01:12:16.082 --> 01:12:18.674
You probably want to go home,
kick back...

01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:21.843
and enjoy a nice glass
of Chihuahua piss or something.

01:12:21.918 --> 01:12:23.009
Farthing.

01:12:25.419 --> 01:12:28.717
Here's the check for $50,000.

01:12:28.788 --> 01:12:30.221
That's great, Mitch.

01:12:33.324 --> 01:12:35.814
Want to bet I don't go to my bookie?

01:12:35.892 --> 01:12:40.155
You're paying off your bookie so you can
live to perform Pops's heart transplant.

01:12:48.332 --> 01:12:50.730
Note to self.

01:12:50.799 --> 01:12:53.665
Stop payment on $50,000 check.

01:12:57.301 --> 01:12:58.495
Oh, Travis.

01:12:58.569 --> 01:13:00.365
Son of a bitch, bastard!

01:13:00.437 --> 01:13:04.371
You idiot. That contract
won't hold up for ten seconds...

01:13:04.439 --> 01:13:06.872
after my lawyers get through with it.

01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:10.738
And, oops, what happened
to your tape?

01:13:10.809 --> 01:13:15.540
You wrecked it. Well, don't worry.
I have one on the house P.A. System.

01:13:15.612 --> 01:13:17.306
Hit it, Kathy.

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:22.112
Note to self. Remember to get
ass wart cream...

01:13:22.182 --> 01:13:24.341
for giant wart on my ass.

01:13:24.416 --> 01:13:27.179
It's a little bit past that.

01:13:27.251 --> 01:13:30.377
You bastard! You can't destroy me.
I'm Travis Cole.

01:13:30.452 --> 01:13:33.511
No one destroy's Travis Cole!
No one!

01:13:37.122 --> 01:13:39.021
Fat lady, are you okay?

01:13:39.090 --> 01:13:44.389
Yes, I'm okay. Just keep
that crazy old man away from me.

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:48.720
What the hell is going on?

01:13:48.795 --> 01:13:51.729
I don't care if you are my son.
Get your own broad.

01:13:52.730 --> 01:13:54.459
Bravo!

01:13:56.865 --> 01:14:00.924
In a startling turn of events
at the opera house...

01:14:01.001 --> 01:14:05.265
real estate mogul Travis Cole
has been arrested for fraud.

01:14:05.336 --> 01:14:07.269
Mr. Cole, anything to say?

01:14:08.438 --> 01:14:10.701
Good brownies.

01:14:10.772 --> 01:14:14.866
Jenkins, listen to me.
This is very important.

01:14:14.941 --> 01:14:20.605
Stop payment on a check for $50,000
I made out to a Dr. Farthing. Got that?

01:14:20.678 --> 01:14:24.634
Jenkins, are you ready
for some crazy, rough sex?

01:14:25.713 --> 01:14:27.645
Absolutely!

01:14:27.713 --> 01:14:32.376
Good, Jenkins. I'm counting on you.
And find Spunky.

01:14:37.953 --> 01:14:39.214
Hey, Mitch.

01:14:39.287 --> 01:14:43.153
Jimmy. Your new nose looks great.

01:14:43.222 --> 01:14:46.315
Thanks. Best $200 I ever spent.

01:14:48.391 --> 01:14:52.554
- That girl you're with, she's not the...
- Yep.

01:14:52.627 --> 01:14:56.754
Lin-Yung, the Saigon whore
who bit my nose off.

01:14:56.829 --> 01:14:58.456
We're getting hitched.

01:15:00.697 --> 01:15:01.788
Let's go.

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:07.266
Hold on.
I'm talking to my friend here!

01:15:07.334 --> 01:15:12.395
Jeez, sometimes you got
to remind the hen who the rooster is.

01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:15.504
Good luck to you, Jimmy.

01:15:15.572 --> 01:15:17.903
Okay. See you around.

01:15:20.907 --> 01:15:23.238
When I say "Let's go," you go.

01:15:23.309 --> 01:15:27.334
Yeah? It's time you shut
your cake hole, Yoko!

01:15:27.411 --> 01:15:28.843
Women.

01:15:30.712 --> 01:15:33.804
Don't talk back to me
in front of my friend.

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:36.313
You're making me really angry.

01:15:36.381 --> 01:15:40.247
Whoa, that scares me to death.

01:15:42.418 --> 01:15:45.852
You bit my new nose off!
Damn it!

01:15:45.919 --> 01:15:48.546
How you feeling with your new heart?

01:15:48.621 --> 01:15:53.283
I feel great thanks to you and Sam,
my two boys.

01:15:53.357 --> 01:15:57.086
Now that I met Gladys, I hope
they can fix another part of my body.

01:15:57.159 --> 01:15:59.455
I'll give you a hint.

01:15:59.526 --> 01:16:01.824
It rhymes with "cock."

01:16:06.330 --> 01:16:11.230
Sam and I got great new jobs.
Pops got his heart. And I got the girl.

01:16:11.298 --> 01:16:15.165
And Dr. Farthing, well,
he got over his gambling problem.

01:16:15.235 --> 01:16:19.101
But the bookies beat him
to death anyway, so he's dead.

01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:22.400
That's it. Bye.

01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:28.933
Cole, it's nice
doing business with you.

01:16:29.008 --> 01:16:31.474
Now you probably want to get home...

01:16:37.545 --> 01:16:38.739
Sorry.

01:16:38.813 --> 01:16:41.542
- Nurse, you want to record vitals?
- Cut.

01:16:41.615 --> 01:16:45.447
Cole, it's been nice doing business
with you. Now you...

01:16:45.517 --> 01:16:47.279
Cut.

01:16:51.253 --> 01:16:53.413
Say your line again.

01:16:57.022 --> 01:17:00.149
- Check the gate please.
- Cut.

01:17:02.958 --> 01:17:07.017
- Well, Cole...
- I'm trying to help you.

01:17:07.094 --> 01:17:09.492
Have you always been like this?

01:17:09.561 --> 01:17:11.790
How you got this movie,
I'll never know.

01:17:11.862 --> 01:17:16.194
- Some other time we could go camping?
- What?

01:17:16.265 --> 01:17:18.926
- You know, just you and me.
- Let's go.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.933
Mitch, I'm lonely.
