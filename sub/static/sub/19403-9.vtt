WEBVTT

00:05.906 --> 00:10.443
I had worked for eight years
at that point...

00:10.444 --> 00:12.512
Up until that point...

00:12.513 --> 00:16.750
To keep the country of Iran
from a nuclear capability.

00:19.287 --> 00:21.954
I organized a plan
to transfer a sum of money

00:21.955 --> 00:23.890
to the candidate who would

00:23.891 --> 00:28.027
work against the goal
of a nuclear Iran.

00:28.028 --> 00:32.465
But... I put it in...

00:32.466 --> 00:34.668
the hands of the other guy.

00:38.005 --> 00:40.740
And that guy had set the
table at that moment

00:40.741 --> 00:43.110
to use it to employ a specialist

00:43.111 --> 00:45.412
to put the final systemization

00:45.413 --> 00:46.680
on their program.

00:48.316 --> 00:50.783
So in May of 2012,
I was in the position of

00:50.784 --> 00:55.356
possibly having
single-handedly armed Iran.

01:03.664 --> 01:06.699
But the money
got away from them.

01:06.700 --> 01:10.870
Due to what we've learned
is the inherent difficulty

01:10.871 --> 01:16.109
of delivering an entity
from A to B, I guess.

01:16.110 --> 01:20.413
And an opportunity arose
to get it back,

01:20.414 --> 01:25.419
just a really nice
opportunity to get it back.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.289
To fix it.

01:30.124 --> 01:31.458
It was...

01:31.459 --> 01:33.760
It was hard to
stop trying to fix it,

01:33.761 --> 01:36.296
my... my personally arming Iran.

01:36.297 --> 01:38.598
So we stayed in there.

01:38.599 --> 01:41.634
Remember, at this stage the...

01:41.635 --> 01:46.906
I mean, at that point,
the money was in the hands of...

01:46.907 --> 01:49.809
Well...

01:49.810 --> 01:52.412
a young puppeteer.

01:52.413 --> 01:53.946
All we had to do was
get through that week,

01:53.947 --> 01:55.783
and get back to Luxembourg.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:07.755 --> 03:10.358
Is there anything you would
like to say as we begin?

03:14.662 --> 03:16.796
Yes.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.299
Proceed.

03:21.235 --> 03:23.937
I'm not really
an industrial engineer.

03:27.741 --> 03:34.447
This matter of yours,
I'm sure, is serious.

03:34.448 --> 03:37.284
And I don't want to
complicate your case,

03:37.285 --> 03:39.587
and take up your time.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.557
I falsified my records here.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.595
I have experience.

03:51.198 --> 03:56.168
Former experience in structural
design and integration.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.737
But I have limited experience

03:57.738 --> 04:00.873
in this specific field
of engineering.

04:00.874 --> 04:04.944
I misrepresented
the degree of my experience

04:04.945 --> 04:06.145
to my employer,

04:06.146 --> 04:11.785
and to a point,
my education in this field.

04:13.186 --> 04:16.255
Your matter, I'm sure,
is serious.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.858
I understand.

04:18.858 --> 04:22.962
And I'll account
for myself honestly.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.366
You and I have met before.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.635
On my first morning here.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.370
On my first visit here.

04:30.371 --> 04:33.340
In your parking lot.

04:33.341 --> 04:36.208
You seemed unsettled.

04:36.209 --> 04:37.877
Then again in Luxembourg.

04:37.878 --> 04:41.814
When you had a health issue
on the street.

04:41.815 --> 04:44.617
When you, um...

04:44.618 --> 04:46.853
I'm not sure of the word.

04:46.854 --> 04:49.322
- Collapsed.
- Collapsed.

04:49.323 --> 04:51.291
On the street.

04:53.594 --> 04:56.863
A man with no police record
in his native country,

04:56.864 --> 05:00.667
no police record over his nine
years of residence in Luxembourg,

05:00.668 --> 05:03.436
was murdered on
the night of May 11th

05:03.437 --> 05:04.905
in Luxembourg City.

05:09.477 --> 05:10.644
Let's begin.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.952
You arrived in Luxembourg
on May 11th?

05:19.953 --> 05:22.789
- Yes.
- With McMillan?

05:22.790 --> 05:24.491
Yes.

05:24.492 --> 05:26.726
Did you interact with
any airport personnel

05:26.727 --> 05:29.696
at the Luxembourg airport
on the 11th?

05:29.697 --> 05:30.930
No.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.865
Do you have knowledge of
any of your colleagues

05:32.866 --> 05:36.736
interacting with airport
personnel on the 11th?

05:36.737 --> 05:37.937
No.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.773
Did you haven any interaction
with airport personnel

05:40.774 --> 05:44.677
elsewhere in Luxembourg
City on May the 11th?

05:44.678 --> 05:46.145
No.

05:46.146 --> 05:49.582
What's the nature of your
relationship with Dennis McClaren?

05:49.583 --> 05:50.751
Co-workers.

05:53.387 --> 05:54.787
Friends.

05:54.788 --> 05:58.591
And you spent some time
together that evening?

05:58.592 --> 06:00.793
Shortly after you arrived?

06:00.794 --> 06:06.265
Yes. Walking around,
checking out the city.

06:06.266 --> 06:08.935
Mr. McClaren was stabbed

06:08.936 --> 06:11.672
shortly after he says
you parted company.

06:14.241 --> 06:15.708
Where did you go after you left

06:15.709 --> 06:18.045
the company of Mr. McClaren?

06:20.914 --> 06:24.451
I was expected at
a business dinner.

06:24.452 --> 06:28.655
With my superior, Leslie Claret.

06:28.656 --> 06:30.957
What time did you
attend this dinner?

06:30.958 --> 06:32.291
I didn't.

06:32.292 --> 06:33.960
- You were expected.
- Yes.

06:33.961 --> 06:36.396
- You didn't attend?
- No.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.834
Your colleague Leslie Claret

06:41.835 --> 06:44.571
said your explanation for
failing to attend this dinner

06:44.572 --> 06:48.407
was a matter concerning a bag.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.677
Luggage from the airport.

06:50.678 --> 06:52.179
Lost at the airport.

06:53.681 --> 06:55.983
He claims you were
retrieving this bag.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.654
You mentioned at the
beginning of this interview

07:01.655 --> 07:04.023
that you had no interaction
with airport personnel

07:04.024 --> 07:07.127
anywhere in Luxembourg
City on May the 11th.

07:09.563 --> 07:10.764
That is correct.

07:14.001 --> 07:17.937
I failed to attend
that dinner...

07:17.938 --> 07:21.909
because I'm in grossly
over my head here.

07:24.077 --> 07:28.481
I was unprepared for the technical
specifics of that meeting.

07:28.482 --> 07:31.250
And I spent time that evening

07:31.251 --> 07:33.219
attempting to gain footing on

07:33.220 --> 07:38.191
the narrow and obscure engineering
specific to our field.

07:39.560 --> 07:43.329
After I left the company
of Dennis McClaren,

07:43.330 --> 07:47.634
I walked to the Haupfhausen Western
European Technical Library,

07:47.635 --> 07:51.671
and I spent time analyzing
the engineering necessary

07:51.672 --> 07:54.106
for that evening's meeting.

07:54.107 --> 07:56.544
In what manner?

07:57.545 --> 08:00.246
There's only one
technical manual

08:00.247 --> 08:05.051
that regards our specific
engineering systems.

08:05.052 --> 08:10.591
"The Integral Principles of the
Structural Dynamics of Flow."

08:29.810 --> 08:31.244
I signed the book out.

08:33.881 --> 08:38.184
And I sat trying to process
what I needed for the evening.

08:41.254 --> 08:43.722
It was too great a task.

08:43.724 --> 08:48.494
I failed to diagnose and
absorb what was necessary

08:48.495 --> 08:51.397
to get me through
that evening's meeting.

08:51.398 --> 08:55.234
So, I arrived well afterwards.

08:55.235 --> 09:00.306
And I told Leslie Claret
the reason for my delay

09:00.307 --> 09:03.409
involved a lost bag.

09:03.410 --> 09:05.012
Which wasn't the case.

09:07.615 --> 09:10.250
Please repeat
the name of this manual.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.286
"The Integral Principles

09:14.287 --> 09:17.123
of the Structural Dynamics
of Flow."

09:17.124 --> 09:18.692
It concerns?

09:20.127 --> 09:22.595
The complicated process
of the delivery

09:22.596 --> 09:24.965
of an entity from A to B.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.538
Did you make any phone calls.

09:32.539 --> 09:34.641
May 11th?

09:34.642 --> 09:36.342
From Luxembourg?

09:36.343 --> 09:39.111
Yes.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.313
No.

09:42.549 --> 09:45.618
Do you know an Alice Taylor?

09:45.619 --> 09:46.786
No.

09:46.787 --> 09:50.089
Did you call Alice Taylor
at 7:07 p.m.

09:50.090 --> 09:54.060
from Luxembourg on
the night of May 11th?

09:54.061 --> 09:55.162
No.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.332
This guy...

10:01.401 --> 10:06.172
This guy, sort of unusual guy.

10:06.173 --> 10:09.341
Suit. American.

10:09.342 --> 10:12.679
He said he was something,
something unusual.

10:12.680 --> 10:16.216
Attaché, he said.

10:18.085 --> 10:22.822
Borrowed my phone on my way back
from the technical library.

10:22.823 --> 10:29.428
He approached me and said he'd
had some belongings stolen.

10:29.429 --> 10:32.665
Asked if he could call
a family member.

10:32.666 --> 10:37.336
And he asked if
he could use my phone.

10:37.337 --> 10:38.604
You allowed this?

10:38.605 --> 10:41.708
Yes. I allowed it.

10:41.709 --> 10:43.376
He seemed like he was
in some trouble.

10:47.848 --> 10:51.517
Do you remember anything else
about that interaction?

10:51.518 --> 10:53.786
- With him?
- Yes.

10:53.787 --> 10:56.056
I remember he never thanked me.

10:58.525 --> 11:00.861
And he had a... a weird badge.

11:08.601 --> 11:11.237
Would you please write
the following.

11:11.238 --> 11:13.340
77 De Champlain.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.305
You seem sad.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.608
I guess I am.

11:49.609 --> 11:51.244
Why?

11:53.546 --> 11:56.615
I've been concerned.

11:56.616 --> 11:59.186
Greatly, I guess.

12:00.988 --> 12:04.623
Concerned over
possibly being dismissed

12:04.624 --> 12:06.193
this last couple of weeks.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.229
Which is why I'm sure
I seemed unsettled

12:10.230 --> 12:13.332
when we encountered each other.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.333
First.

12:17.204 --> 12:20.672
I haven't been able to
eat or sleep

12:20.673 --> 12:23.342
this last two weeks.

12:23.343 --> 12:27.414
Which, I guess,
is why I dropped that day.

12:31.885 --> 12:35.322
So why so sad, John,
at this moment?

12:38.959 --> 12:42.495
I, was dismissed earlier today.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.240
Thank you.

12:54.241 --> 12:57.110
For your time and your help
with our investigation.

13:32.946 --> 13:36.917
"The Integral Principles of the
Structural Dynamics of Flow."

13:49.062 --> 13:52.164
She's at the Colony Motel
on Lauder Avenue, 207.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.534
She asked if you'd just
come right over after work.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.258
Hey. Edward Tavner.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.993
I have an appointment
with Detective Mills.

14:53.994 --> 14:57.330
- Regarding?
- The theft of my attaché shit.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.599
Check it out, guy.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.700
Wait here.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.303
I'll retrieve Detective Mills.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.986
Yeah?

19:14.987 --> 19:15.987
- Hello.
- Hi.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.423
I never got your email.

19:17.424 --> 19:18.758
I'm sending it now.

20:08.007 --> 20:10.842
I'm sorry, am I at 211?

20:10.843 --> 20:12.110
This is 207.

20:12.111 --> 20:13.245
I'm very sorry.

20:13.246 --> 20:14.613
No problem.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.949
Alice, leave. At once.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.667
I realized Alice had left.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.736
I followed you from McMillan.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.237
I followed you
to your impending...

20:39.238 --> 20:41.239
Fuck.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.941
What?

20:42.942 --> 20:46.346
I forgot to kill Birdbath.

22:43.596 --> 22:45.865
Someone put their hand
on my back.

22:48.134 --> 22:51.503
At this point,
we had a strong expectation

22:51.504 --> 22:53.472
that we would recover the bag.

22:53.473 --> 22:55.206
The only real impediment

22:55.207 --> 22:57.175
to recovery and
re-establishing the plan

22:57.176 --> 22:59.210
was the guy with
the girl's name.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.813
Our resource simply couldn't
return to Luxembourg

23:01.814 --> 23:03.949
to recover the bag
at that point.

23:03.950 --> 23:06.685
He needed assistance
getting back on something

23:06.686 --> 23:08.755
we were calling
the travel squad.

23:10.256 --> 23:14.993
So, end of this hunt,
you tie up your loose ends.

23:14.994 --> 23:17.062
All these threads
that can still unravel

23:17.063 --> 23:19.998
the chance to get back
to Luxembourg Monday.

23:19.999 --> 23:23.101
I'll deal with the guy
with the girl's name.

23:23.102 --> 23:25.604
Yeah.

23:25.605 --> 23:27.406
How many loose ends do you have?

23:29.408 --> 23:35.547
Stephen, Birdbath,
Icabod, Gregory Gordon.

23:35.548 --> 23:37.149
Several, I guess.

23:46.559 --> 23:48.994
My dad's visiting.
I brought him along.

23:48.995 --> 23:51.096
Haven't seen him in a while.

23:51.097 --> 23:55.233
He's been away. At sea.

23:55.234 --> 23:56.535
Leslie.

23:56.536 --> 23:58.770
You're a tugger, I understand.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.472
Tugboat captain, your son says.

24:00.473 --> 24:02.407
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

24:02.408 --> 24:03.942
Tom.

24:03.943 --> 24:07.613
I'm not a tugger myself.
I just have that tugboat blood.

24:07.614 --> 24:10.582
Well, I guess we'll have a few things
to talk about then, won't we, Leslie?

24:10.583 --> 24:12.250
Probably, Tom, probably.

24:12.251 --> 24:14.553
Maybe we'll get some time
together in the marsh.

24:14.554 --> 24:16.655
Right. We can share
our favorite tugboat jokes.

24:16.656 --> 24:19.625
Damn right.

24:19.626 --> 24:21.127
Well, this is Lawrence,
my number two.

24:23.229 --> 24:24.563
Tom Lakeman.

24:24.564 --> 24:27.032
- This is Icabod.
- Hey. Hey.

24:27.033 --> 24:28.333
Hey, there.

24:28.334 --> 24:29.502
What's your real name?

24:34.440 --> 24:35.473
What?

24:35.474 --> 24:38.677
Long weekend, team.

24:38.678 --> 24:40.311
The goal?

24:40.312 --> 24:43.515
Let's come together.

24:43.516 --> 24:45.884
We're gonna have some fun
over this weekend.

24:45.885 --> 24:48.787
S'mores, you know,
campfire stories.

24:48.788 --> 24:52.323
Talent show. Great.

24:52.324 --> 24:56.127
Let's get to know each other
over this weekend.

24:56.128 --> 24:58.096
All the way.

24:58.097 --> 25:02.100
All right, McMillan,
into the marsh.

25:02.101 --> 25:03.769
Let's come together,

25:03.770 --> 25:05.571
then let's head off to
Luxembourg

25:05.572 --> 25:06.838
a fortified unit,

25:06.839 --> 25:10.676
and get this goddamn
Denon deal done.

25:10.677 --> 25:13.245
Except for Lakeman,
who's simply not going.

25:15.815 --> 25:17.883
So at this late stage,
it's time to alert you to

25:17.884 --> 25:21.587
a paper work situation
involving John Lakeman.

25:21.588 --> 25:23.321
Flawed paper work.

25:23.322 --> 25:28.493
He can't stay at McMillan
in his current situation.

25:28.494 --> 25:31.262
Can't really stay in America...

25:31.263 --> 25:34.099
really, in fact, I guess.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.567
It's mysterious.

25:35.568 --> 25:41.539
I've begun looking more deeply
into his background, frankly.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.142
Out of curiosity, frankly.

25:47.980 --> 25:50.882
I wasn't really listening
to what you said,

25:50.883 --> 25:54.720
'cause John's done after
this weekend, anyway,

25:54.721 --> 25:57.555
unless Leslie has
a change of heart,

25:57.556 --> 26:02.360
which, you know, what are the
fuckin' chances of that?

26:02.361 --> 26:05.797
So don't sweat it, Gregory.

26:05.798 --> 26:08.968
Like I said, curious now.

26:10.703 --> 26:13.104
So the guy goes back aft,

26:13.105 --> 26:16.041
and the captain says,
"No, you idiot,"

26:16.042 --> 26:18.210
"the forward quarter bilt."

26:20.279 --> 26:22.547
God, I love that one.

26:22.548 --> 26:24.449
- Me, too.
- Yeah.

26:24.450 --> 26:26.451
Love.

26:26.452 --> 26:27.686
- Yeah.
- Because it's so true.

26:27.687 --> 26:29.054
Well, you're damn right it is.

26:29.055 --> 26:32.057
I mean, picture this guy
at the Morse lamp

26:32.058 --> 26:34.392
halfway to the fuckin'
Kort nozzle.

26:34.393 --> 26:37.462
I can just picture that.

26:37.463 --> 26:39.230
Hilarious?

26:39.231 --> 26:41.734
Yeah, it sure is, Tom.

26:44.336 --> 26:46.004
Fuck.

26:46.005 --> 26:48.340
What the fuck do you mean,
you forgot?

26:50.877 --> 26:54.312
I got a lot going on, man.

26:54.313 --> 26:58.184
I sat in my shack
all afternoon like a jerk.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.254
Sorry, man.

27:03.589 --> 27:06.992
It had to be yesterday,
that was the way.

27:06.993 --> 27:09.028
You fucked it up, John. Come on.

27:13.700 --> 27:16.935
I'm really sorry, man.

27:16.936 --> 27:19.938
I want 400 grand in that account

27:19.939 --> 27:21.973
by the end of the day,

27:21.974 --> 27:26.377
or I tell a really interesting
campfire story tonight

27:26.378 --> 27:29.882
about something I heard
in the bathroom one time.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.590
Well, you won't enjoy
your S'mores

27:39.591 --> 27:42.795
very much after that. Jerk.

27:44.931 --> 27:46.665
What do you know
about John, Icabod?

27:50.770 --> 27:52.404
Mum's the word.

27:56.575 --> 27:57.877
At this point.

28:00.679 --> 28:01.914
What does that mean?

28:05.217 --> 28:06.217
Nothing.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.757
But you said mum's the word.

28:11.758 --> 28:12.925
Sure.

28:16.428 --> 28:17.429
Then you said nothing.

28:19.631 --> 28:20.800
Sure.

28:24.436 --> 28:26.973
No, that's confusing.
What does that mean?

28:31.543 --> 28:32.711
We'll see.

28:47.794 --> 28:50.228
Intentionally?

28:50.229 --> 28:52.030
I think so, yeah.

28:52.031 --> 28:54.766
We were competing
for this position.

28:54.767 --> 28:55.967
Pushed you?

28:55.968 --> 28:57.936
Yes.

28:57.937 --> 29:02.107
Is this like a really good
position or something?

29:02.108 --> 29:05.344
- Our position, mine and John's?
- Yeah.

29:07.513 --> 29:10.849
I mean, it would be better
if I didn't have to share it.

29:10.850 --> 29:14.052
And if I had a whole desk.

29:14.053 --> 29:15.686
I mean, would a guy
push another guy

29:15.687 --> 29:17.856
in front of a truck
for this position?

29:17.857 --> 29:19.490
It's not like
mayor or something.

29:19.491 --> 29:21.526
No, it's not like mayor.

29:21.527 --> 29:22.627
Then why would he do it?

29:22.628 --> 29:24.429
I don't know.

29:24.430 --> 29:27.166
But I think he did it.

29:32.038 --> 29:35.440
Listen, you just better
be certain, Stephen.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.208
You can't just be
fucking making shit up

29:37.209 --> 29:39.544
at this point in your rehab.

29:39.545 --> 29:41.013
Looks really bad on me.

29:43.549 --> 29:46.518
I think John pushed me.

29:48.988 --> 29:51.222
Do some deep thinking
this weekend

29:51.223 --> 29:52.223
about that day

29:52.224 --> 29:55.693
until you can say
for certain, Stephen.

29:55.694 --> 29:56.862
You can't say you're recovered

29:56.863 --> 29:58.497
unless you can say
you're certain.

30:29.929 --> 30:31.863
Boy.

30:31.864 --> 30:33.599
You're clumsy, Stephen.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.172
Yeah.

30:43.675 --> 30:46.178
Stumbling through the forest.

30:47.313 --> 30:48.313
Yeah.

30:50.649 --> 30:53.185
Walkin' in front of trucks.

30:54.353 --> 30:55.353
No, I didn't.

30:57.823 --> 30:59.491
Sure, you did.

31:00.392 --> 31:01.392
No, I didn't.

31:11.670 --> 31:14.705
You have kids, Leslie?

31:14.706 --> 31:17.242
Yes.

31:17.243 --> 31:19.577
Boy, girl?

31:19.578 --> 31:20.979
One of each, Tom.

31:20.980 --> 31:23.449
Lucky man.

31:25.651 --> 31:27.086
Yeah.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.888
I have two boys.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.858
Nice.

31:33.859 --> 31:35.995
John's the good one.

31:38.030 --> 31:40.331
Well, I don't mean good.

31:40.332 --> 31:42.600
You know what I mean. They're...

31:42.601 --> 31:44.936
They're different.

31:44.937 --> 31:47.205
Well, the other one must be
quite the fuck up,

31:47.206 --> 31:48.975
you don't mind my sayin'.

31:52.311 --> 31:55.113
You know what, Leslie?
I do mind.

31:55.114 --> 31:57.548
Your sayin'.

31:57.549 --> 31:58.716
And I'll tell you why.

31:58.717 --> 32:02.321
All ears, Tom.

32:03.489 --> 32:06.057
You're reading John
wrong, Leslie.

32:06.058 --> 32:08.693
How so, Tom?

32:08.694 --> 32:11.762
He's a terrific kid.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.499
You'd be glad to know him,
Leslie, if you knew him.

32:14.500 --> 32:15.900
I do, Tom.

32:15.901 --> 32:17.935
No, no, I'm afraid
you don't, Leslie.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.105
Well...

32:20.106 --> 32:22.607
- Leslie.
- Yeah.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.977
Tell me about your son.

32:27.213 --> 32:30.715
Well, that's a bit
complicated, Tom.

32:30.716 --> 32:31.716
How's that, Leslie?

32:33.719 --> 32:34.785
Marcus, my son,

32:34.786 --> 32:41.759
my half-Vietnamese
32 year old...

32:41.760 --> 32:42.760
boy,

32:42.761 --> 32:47.965
we... we're...

32:47.966 --> 32:52.104
Well... we were pals, Tom.

32:55.074 --> 32:59.177
Enjoyed life's cool moments,
big and small.

32:59.178 --> 33:01.080
Side-by-side.

33:02.948 --> 33:05.216
Pals.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.785
No doubt about that.

33:07.786 --> 33:10.156
That sounds good, Leslie.

33:11.290 --> 33:13.592
Yeah, it was good, Tom, before...

33:18.497 --> 33:19.497
Before?

33:23.302 --> 33:26.071
I'm not perfect, Tom.

33:26.072 --> 33:27.606
There was a time...

33:30.409 --> 33:33.411
Well, I put myself first.

33:33.412 --> 33:34.413
For a time.

33:36.548 --> 33:39.151
For a miserable period when I...

33:43.822 --> 33:45.524
Well, we're not pals anymore.

33:47.993 --> 33:49.295
Goddamn.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.765
He's a grown man, Tom.

34:00.739 --> 34:03.841
Well...

34:03.842 --> 34:05.177
tomorrow.

34:07.646 --> 34:09.114
Yeah.

34:09.880 --> 34:12.783
A new morning.

34:12.784 --> 34:14.051
Who knows what's in store.

34:14.052 --> 34:17.922
Maybe start out with
a breakfast.

34:17.922 --> 34:20.291
You know?
That's the meal where...

34:20.292 --> 34:22.993
Well, you have
the whole day ahead.

34:22.994 --> 34:24.329
You can still fool yourself

34:24.330 --> 34:26.130
you might actually
accomplish something.

34:26.132 --> 34:27.232
You know what I mean, Leslie?

34:27.233 --> 34:29.065
Over breakfast.

34:29.067 --> 34:32.203
You're right, Tom,
you're damn right.

34:32.204 --> 34:35.306
You want to have a breakfast
tomorrow, Leslie?

34:35.306 --> 34:36.641
Sounds good, Tom.

34:36.641 --> 34:38.275
It will be good, Leslie.

34:38.277 --> 34:40.110
John and I brought
a whole spread.

34:40.112 --> 34:41.911
Bagels, bacon, you know?

34:41.913 --> 34:44.282
Whole spread.

34:44.283 --> 34:45.683
I look forward to that, Tom.

34:45.684 --> 34:47.819
I... I sure will.

34:48.887 --> 34:50.121
Me too, Leslie.

34:53.225 --> 34:55.893
You really are a jerk, John.

34:55.893 --> 34:59.063
You could at least come by after work.
You know where I live.

34:59.064 --> 35:02.834
You could have done it then.

35:03.835 --> 35:06.137
I'm sorry.

35:06.138 --> 35:09.208
This thing with the cop
threw me.

35:10.876 --> 35:12.511
Why's that cop comin' around?

35:15.281 --> 35:16.582
Something happened.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.520
What kind of cop is she?

35:22.921 --> 35:24.190
Homicide.

35:31.129 --> 35:33.532
Were you gonna do it?

35:35.967 --> 35:38.404
I don't know what
I'm gonna do anymore.

35:43.008 --> 35:44.843
Are you gonna talk?

35:49.515 --> 35:52.551
I don't really know what
I'm gonna do anymore, either.

35:53.685 --> 35:55.821
I don't know
where you go from here.

35:59.725 --> 36:00.725
Yeah.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.929
- Jack.
- Yeah?

36:04.930 --> 36:08.566
They can't get you $400,000.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.536
They can't even get me a chair.

36:22.648 --> 36:25.316
You don't look too good, my man.

36:25.317 --> 36:26.852
You don't mind me sayin'.

36:30.556 --> 36:32.558
I'll see you at the campfire.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.300
Tale time.

36:42.301 --> 36:44.034
What's that?

36:44.035 --> 36:46.437
Campfire story.

36:46.438 --> 36:48.105
Come on, someone have at it.

36:48.106 --> 36:49.641
Scary story.

36:51.142 --> 36:52.311
Come on.

36:55.647 --> 36:57.883
Probably Icabod should go, no?

37:02.321 --> 37:05.155
Why should I do it, Tom?

37:05.156 --> 37:06.358
As opposed to the others?

37:17.403 --> 37:19.505
I know a story.

37:21.607 --> 37:23.409
What you got, Jack?

37:24.843 --> 37:29.179
Probably won't believe it,
though it's a true story.

37:29.180 --> 37:31.882
True story.

37:31.883 --> 37:33.718
This guy here,

37:33.719 --> 37:35.387
you're not gonna believe this.

37:36.522 --> 37:39.024
This guys and his dad...

37:44.062 --> 37:46.497
still seem to get along.

37:46.498 --> 37:48.699
How about that?

37:48.700 --> 37:52.937
Families who still
like each other.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.739
It's rare.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.608
Look at the way
he looks at his father.

37:59.311 --> 38:01.347
It's nice to see.

38:18.364 --> 38:23.000
Why am I most suited
to tell a scary tale?

38:23.001 --> 38:27.972
I don't know,
you just have a kind of a...

38:27.973 --> 38:30.576
headless kind of vibe.

38:36.415 --> 38:39.049
- Leslie.
- Yeah.

38:39.050 --> 38:41.251
Guy's tricky.

38:41.252 --> 38:43.320
Yeah.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.889
What's the deal with that?

38:44.890 --> 38:47.726
He likes this other guy.
Stephen.

38:52.831 --> 38:55.600
Can you drive a wedge
between 'em?

38:55.601 --> 38:57.167
What, like tonight?

38:57.168 --> 38:58.470
Yeah.

39:00.606 --> 39:03.608
We pretty much just have
Sharing Time,

39:03.609 --> 39:06.343
whatever that is,
and a talent show.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.880
I... I don't know.

39:10.449 --> 39:11.983
Clock's ticking, John.

39:14.319 --> 39:17.888
Leslie's estranged
from his family.

39:17.889 --> 39:18.889
Work that.

39:26.164 --> 39:28.032
Sharing Time

39:28.033 --> 39:30.468
allows us to go around
the horn here,

39:30.469 --> 39:32.169
and share thoughts.

39:32.170 --> 39:36.206
Well, private thoughts
about our work place

39:36.207 --> 39:37.608
that, for whatever reason,

39:37.609 --> 39:40.546
we're reluctant
to share ordinarily.

39:41.947 --> 39:45.149
In Sharing Time,
there are no repercussions,

39:45.150 --> 39:47.718
upshots or even
slaps on the wrist.

39:47.719 --> 39:51.922
It's just about the team
becoming a tighter team.

39:51.923 --> 39:54.059
Share anything.

39:56.528 --> 39:58.996
Let's get started, team.

39:58.997 --> 40:00.731
Gregory.

40:00.732 --> 40:04.603
What would you change about
your work place environment?

40:06.371 --> 40:10.007
Brighter colors.
About the office.

40:10.008 --> 40:14.446
Okay. Can do. Good.

40:19.117 --> 40:21.218
Well, let's just
go around the horn. Next.

40:21.219 --> 40:23.387
John.

40:23.388 --> 40:26.423
I'd change the fact that

40:26.424 --> 40:31.061
Stephen says bad things about
all you guys all the time.

40:31.062 --> 40:36.133
He says really bad stuff
about all you guys.

40:36.134 --> 40:38.903
All the time.

40:38.904 --> 40:40.706
Like?

40:42.140 --> 40:43.841
Like he said you think
you're all cool

40:43.842 --> 40:46.977
because you're
in charge now, Leslie.

40:46.978 --> 40:48.378
But you can't even be
in charge of

40:48.379 --> 40:51.181
the important things
in your life.

40:51.182 --> 40:53.785
And your family probably
doesn't even talk to you.

40:56.488 --> 41:02.092
Well, I... I don't see how that's
any of Stephen's business.

41:02.093 --> 41:04.596
I don't think I said that.

41:06.164 --> 41:10.100
I don't see how that's
any of your concern, son.

41:10.101 --> 41:11.703
That's what I think.

41:13.705 --> 41:15.305
That's enough Sharing Time.

41:15.306 --> 41:17.274
Let's...

41:17.275 --> 41:20.745
Let's just start the...

41:20.746 --> 41:22.246
Whatever the fuck that thing is,

41:22.247 --> 41:23.447
the talent show.

41:23.448 --> 41:25.750
It's okay.

41:25.751 --> 41:27.785
No, this is gonna...
This is gonna be great.

41:27.786 --> 41:29.787
It's gonna be great.

41:29.788 --> 41:31.922
Yeah.

41:31.923 --> 41:33.859
- Yeah.
- All right.

41:50.075 --> 41:52.076
Leslie.

41:52.077 --> 41:53.544
Yeah, Tom?

41:53.545 --> 41:56.714
Could we have a word about John?

41:56.715 --> 41:58.649
What's on your mind, Tom?

41:58.650 --> 42:02.286
Well, I know there's been
some friction.

42:02.287 --> 42:04.121
He mentioned.

42:04.122 --> 42:09.894
He also mentioned that he wishes
it were otherwise, Leslie.

42:09.895 --> 42:12.362
There has been friction.

42:12.363 --> 42:14.498
From the beginning.

42:14.499 --> 42:16.602
'Fraid so, Tom, 'fraid so.

42:19.004 --> 42:23.709
He had a hard year previous
to his time with McMillan.

42:25.744 --> 42:29.046
A lot was asked of him, and...

42:29.047 --> 42:30.915
maybe he was...

42:30.916 --> 42:35.152
struggling to carry
some weight, I think.

42:35.153 --> 42:39.890
He carried it a long way
alone, really.

42:39.891 --> 42:44.261
- And maybe, Leslie...
- Yeah.

42:44.262 --> 42:49.299
Maybe you could, give him a
break for a few more weeks.

42:49.300 --> 42:52.536
Let him show you that
he's a really good man

42:52.537 --> 42:55.472
to have on your side, Leslie,

42:55.473 --> 42:59.310
and depend on. John.

43:01.046 --> 43:04.749
Anyway, my son isn't who
you think he is, Leslie.

43:04.750 --> 43:06.317
He's a good boy.

43:09.721 --> 43:12.857
Maybe you could
give a kid a break.

43:12.858 --> 43:15.694
From one old tug-boater
to another.

43:20.598 --> 43:22.833
Tom,

43:22.834 --> 43:25.770
prisoners who perform
helpful tasks

43:25.771 --> 43:29.774
that, serve the greater
prison population,

43:29.775 --> 43:35.112
like, say, barbers or
prison dental hygienists,

43:35.113 --> 43:38.749
they often get a...
A symbol of that job

43:38.750 --> 43:41.518
tattooed somewhere
on their back,

43:41.519 --> 43:44.154
stave off assaults from behind

43:44.155 --> 43:47.793
that, are common
in prison surroundings.

43:51.162 --> 43:55.365
I have a tattoo of
a small bicuspid

43:55.366 --> 43:58.502
on the back of my neck, Tom,

43:58.503 --> 44:02.406
because for 18 months...

44:02.407 --> 44:06.812
I cleaned the teeth of
a large prison population.

44:09.681 --> 44:11.917
Built a beautiful life.

44:14.219 --> 44:17.855
And I tore it down.

44:17.856 --> 44:20.858
And I flossed the teeth of...

44:20.859 --> 44:25.562
Well, men I wouldn't
share a bus with ordinarily,

44:25.563 --> 44:30.435
so I could be allowed to begin
rebuilding it three months early.

44:33.571 --> 44:36.341
Your son was supposed to
help me build.

44:39.677 --> 44:42.980
But he's encumbering that.

44:42.981 --> 44:45.817
That most important thing.

44:48.419 --> 44:52.123
So what I think...

44:53.725 --> 44:54.993
Yeah?

44:59.230 --> 45:00.931
I like you, Tom.

45:00.932 --> 45:02.699
Same here, Leslie.

45:02.700 --> 45:05.904
Well, good. Good, Tom.

45:06.938 --> 45:08.740
But what I think...

45:11.309 --> 45:13.744
If you'd like to know
what I think

45:13.745 --> 45:16.014
about your son...

45:18.183 --> 45:19.884
I'm sorry, Tom,

45:19.885 --> 45:25.022
but I think your son
is weak-willed and soft,

45:25.023 --> 45:27.893
and let's his daddy
fight his battles.

45:30.661 --> 45:31.929
So...

45:31.930 --> 45:35.400
I like you. I do.

45:36.902 --> 45:40.038
But... nope.

45:47.512 --> 45:50.415
That other kid doesn't seem
to like you that much.

45:52.818 --> 45:56.253
That other kid got hit
by a fuckin' truck.

45:56.254 --> 45:58.389
I don't know what
John's problem is.

46:19.477 --> 46:21.812
Man, what a hard ass.

46:21.813 --> 46:23.680
Did you have a breakfast?

46:23.681 --> 46:26.483
Yeah.

46:26.484 --> 46:27.484
Didn't work.

46:29.587 --> 46:33.158
Okay. Dick Cheney.

46:35.626 --> 46:38.562
What?

46:38.563 --> 46:40.465
Dick Cheney.

46:44.002 --> 46:46.004
I don't know who that is.

46:48.874 --> 46:50.607
You don't know who
Dick Cheney is?

46:50.608 --> 46:52.877
No.

46:52.878 --> 46:55.479
Former vice president?

46:55.480 --> 46:57.082
Okay.

46:58.649 --> 47:01.385
So what?

47:01.386 --> 47:04.188
- So he was duck hunting...
- Yeah.

47:04.189 --> 47:07.591
- Just like you.
- Yeah.

47:07.592 --> 47:10.760
And during that duck hunt...

47:10.761 --> 47:12.696
Yeah.

47:12.697 --> 47:14.966
He shot some guy in the face.

47:33.551 --> 47:34.886
Morning, Leslie.

47:36.821 --> 47:38.056
Lakeman.
