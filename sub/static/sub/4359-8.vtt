<i> My sister Annie

Oh, no.

01:22.640 --> 01:24.640
Yeah...
Maybe you should get up.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.560
Your alarm went off
an hour ago.

01:26.560 --> 01:28.520
Mom told Ray not
to wait for you.

01:52.760 --> 01:55.720
Sorry... I overslept.

01:55.720 --> 01:58.600
I want to see you
after school, Alex.

02:02.240 --> 02:05.000
<i>( Electrical zapping )</i>

02:11.680 --> 02:13.000
So, this is
supposed to

02:13.000 --> 02:14.600
stimulate his brain waves?

02:14.600 --> 02:16.000
Exactly, but with Dave

02:16.000 --> 02:18.680
I'm not sure how much
there is to stimulate.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.720
I'm just hoping
one of these jolts

02:20.720 --> 02:22.360
will shake
something loose.

02:22.360 --> 02:24.320
<i>( Zapping )</i>

02:24.320 --> 02:25.880
This is worth a try,
Vince

02:25.880 --> 02:28.760
but we should stop
before we do serious damage.

02:28.760 --> 02:30.040
Aw, do I have to?

02:30.040 --> 02:32.000
Yes, we may need him
later.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.480
Oh, David,
you back with us?

02:33.480 --> 02:35.160
Yeah.

02:36.720 --> 02:40.240
I assume you have
nothing for us.

02:40.240 --> 02:42.480
You can go home now.

02:42.480 --> 02:45.680
Wait, Vince,
I think I got an idea.

02:45.680 --> 02:46.960
Can't be sure, though.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.400
It doesn't happen often.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.040
Yeah, well,
make it quick.

02:50.040 --> 02:51.640
Miss Atron
is very busy.

02:51.640 --> 02:54.200
We know the kid
goes to the Junior High

02:54.200 --> 02:55.640
or high school, right?

02:55.640 --> 02:56.880
That's good, Dave.

02:56.880 --> 02:58.440
Major progress here.

02:58.440 --> 03:01.720
So instead of us doing
the surveillance on each kid

03:01.720 --> 03:04.600
why don't we have the teachers
do it for us?

03:04.600 --> 03:06.280
Who gets closer
to the kids

03:06.280 --> 03:07.480
than the teachers?

03:07.480 --> 03:09.000
Using the school system

03:09.000 --> 03:11.280
could add legitimacy
to our search.

03:11.280 --> 03:13.120
It could help us enormously.

03:13.120 --> 03:14.240
I like it.

03:14.240 --> 03:15.600
The future of GC-161

03:15.600 --> 03:17.680
depends on
finding that student

03:17.680 --> 03:21.040
and the future of this company
depends on GC-161.

03:21.040 --> 03:22.600
I want a full plan laid out

03:22.600 --> 03:24.560
and I want to know
how to approach it

03:24.560 --> 03:26.320
without raising any questions.

03:26.320 --> 03:27.440
Good work, don.

03:27.440 --> 03:30.160
That's Dave.

03:30.160 --> 03:33.400
Remember... when Spain
was under attack

03:33.400 --> 03:35.800
from Franco and the fascists

03:35.800 --> 03:37.080
volunteers

03:37.080 --> 03:38.440
from over 50 countries

03:38.440 --> 03:40.440
organized international brigades

03:40.440 --> 03:42.160
to help fight them.

03:42.160 --> 03:44.560
Think about that, class.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.800
Volunteers who
weren't even Spanish

03:46.800 --> 03:48.480
men and women
courageously

03:48.480 --> 03:51.600
risking their lives for
a principle they believed in.

03:51.600 --> 03:55.680
Have any of you ever
had to stand up for something

03:55.680 --> 03:58.560
that you believed
so strongly in?

03:59.680 --> 04:00.800
Yes, Ray?

04:00.800 --> 04:02.720
I publicly protested
in the cafeteria

04:02.720 --> 04:03.960
about the soggy fries.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.160
<i>( Class laughing )</i>

04:06.160 --> 04:07.640
That's a start, Raymond.

04:07.640 --> 04:10.200
In your own way,
you're making this world

04:10.200 --> 04:11.920
a better place
to live. Alex?

04:11.920 --> 04:14.200
Our lives aren't
like that, Miss Clark.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.960
We don't have a war going on

04:15.960 --> 04:19.279
and there really isn't
too much stuff to stand up for.

04:19.279 --> 04:22.000
Is Alex right, class?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.160
Maybe, but for homework
this week

04:24.160 --> 04:26.600
read more
about the Spanish Civil War

04:26.600 --> 04:28.920
and compare it
with your own lives.

04:28.920 --> 04:33.520
<i>( Class bell ringing ) And see if
sometimes you don't exhibit unusual courage.</i>

04:33.520 --> 04:36.400
I bet you do.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.840
Oh, and, Alex?

04:38.920 --> 04:40.480
Don't forget, after school.

04:54.640 --> 04:56.360
Okay... so, uh...

04:56.360 --> 04:59.120
Each of the teachers
will fill out this form

04:59.120 --> 05:01.880
telling us if they've
seen anything unusual

05:01.880 --> 05:03.080
in their students.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.440
Would you shut up?

05:04.440 --> 05:07.680
One good idea stimulated
by a brain machine

05:07.680 --> 05:09.000
and now you think

05:09.000 --> 05:11.040
you're some kind
of genius.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.520
Thanks, Vince.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.120
I hate you.

05:17.120 --> 05:21.000
<i>Alex: I can't believe
she's the only teacher I like</i>

05:21.000 --> 05:22.600
and she's
the only teacher

05:22.600 --> 05:24.000
I get in trouble with.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.120
If you can make
history interesting

05:26.120 --> 05:27.440
you know you're good.

05:27.440 --> 05:29.320
She's a great
track coach, too.

05:29.320 --> 05:31.200
Think she'll call
your parents?

05:31.200 --> 05:32.160
<i>( Sighs )</i>

05:32.160 --> 05:34.160
I guess I'll find out.

05:42.960 --> 05:45.560
Miss Atron and P.V.C.P.
Have decided to sponsor

05:45.560 --> 05:48.520
the Paradise Valley
child-of-the-year program.

05:48.520 --> 05:49.480
Ah, sounds great.

05:49.480 --> 05:50.800
Yes, at P.V. Chemical

05:50.800 --> 05:53.160
we're very connected
to our community

05:53.160 --> 05:56.000
and feel that by finding
exceptional children

05:56.000 --> 05:58.640
and entering them
in national competitions

05:58.640 --> 06:01.520
we can raise the awareness
of our great town.

06:01.520 --> 06:02.640
And we assume

06:02.640 --> 06:04.880
that you always
have your eyes open

06:04.880 --> 06:06.480
<i>for any child exhibiting</i>

06:06.480 --> 06:09.040
any extraordinary abilities
or talents.

06:09.040 --> 06:10.000
I always do.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.280
<i>( Chuckles )
Good.</i>

06:11.280 --> 06:12.840
Well, all
you have to do

06:12.840 --> 06:14.960
is fill out a form
for each child

06:14.960 --> 06:16.400
and leave
the rest to us.

06:16.400 --> 06:17.640
Any problems
with it?

06:17.640 --> 06:19.880
Why would I have
any problems?

06:19.880 --> 06:21.480
It sounds wonderful.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.840
Miss Atron greatly appreciates
your participation.

06:29.840 --> 06:31.360
Have a, uh,
productive day

06:31.360 --> 06:33.360
Miss Clark.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.440
Hi, Miss Clark.

06:57.440 --> 06:58.800
Alex.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.600
I have something very serious

07:00.600 --> 07:02.600
I need to talk to you about.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.240
Miss Clark, let me explain.

07:04.240 --> 07:07.400
You're my favorite teacher
and I'm not just saying that.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.880
But I promise
I'll never be late again.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.920
Well, I'm very happy
to hear that.

07:11.920 --> 07:15.120
But I wanted to talk to you
about something else:

07:15.120 --> 07:16.080
The track team.

07:16.080 --> 07:17.800
The track team?

07:17.800 --> 07:19.200
Do you have any idea

07:19.200 --> 07:21.680
how fast you made it
down that hallway?

07:21.680 --> 07:23.880
Well, you were cooking.

07:23.880 --> 07:25.000
Really?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.120

07:26.120 --> 07:27.560

07:31.040 --> 07:33.120

Come on.</i>

07:35.480 --> 07:36.520
All right!

07:36.520 --> 07:38.600
Good time, guys!

07:38.600 --> 07:40.240
Yes, yes!

07:40.240 --> 07:42.000
So, what do
you think, Ray?

07:42.960 --> 07:44.360
I think I had a pebble

07:44.360 --> 07:45.560
in my shoe.

07:45.560 --> 07:47.440
Alex, I'd like you
to anchor

07:47.440 --> 07:49.080
our shuttle relay team.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.520
We could sure use you.

07:50.520 --> 07:51.760
Well, I don't know.

07:51.760 --> 07:54.680
I really don't like
to join things too much.

07:54.680 --> 07:57.760
Alex, we've had one of
the state's best track teams.

07:57.760 --> 07:59.680
But somehow,
the past three years

07:59.680 --> 08:01.560
we seem to have lost our edge.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.120
Last year...

08:03.120 --> 08:04.560
We didn't even
win a meet.

08:04.560 --> 08:05.760
You could help

08:05.760 --> 08:07.680
put the school back
on the map.

08:07.680 --> 08:08.640
Not to mention

08:08.640 --> 08:09.760
to be considered

08:09.760 --> 08:12.280
one of the coolest
kids in school.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.160
Okay, why not?

08:15.160 --> 08:16.760
All right, yes!

08:21.760 --> 08:23.520
People never
really think about

08:23.520 --> 08:25.200
how they can
affect history.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.280
Miss Clark told us

08:26.280 --> 08:27.800
all this fascinating
stuff

08:27.800 --> 08:29.560
about the Spanish Civil War.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.320
Loyalists versus nationalists

08:31.320 --> 08:33.039
prelude to
World War II.

08:33.039 --> 08:35.240
Tell us more about
the track team.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.440
Well, I never realized
how fast I was.

08:37.440 --> 08:39.600
Actually, I wouldn't
have even noticed

08:39.600 --> 08:41.320
if it weren't for
Miss Clark.

08:41.320 --> 08:44.480
You know, I haven't timed myself
in the 100 in years.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.120
I was known to get down
the line pretty fast.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.920
I'm a bit of
a speed-burner myself.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.800
Well... perhaps
we'll race sometime.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.080
I'll let the press know.

08:54.080 --> 08:55.800
<i>( Tapping glass )</i>

08:55.800 --> 08:57.160
With that in mind

08:57.160 --> 08:59.840
I think it only fitting
that I make a toast.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.120
To Alex.

09:01.120 --> 09:02.400
Mrs. Mack:
To Alex.

09:02.400 --> 09:03.720
To Alex.

09:10.520 --> 09:12.360
Alex... that could

09:12.360 --> 09:14.680
have just as easily
been Mom or Dad.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.960
No, it couldn't,
they always knock.

09:20.320 --> 09:23.000
Can I talk to you for a sec?

09:23.960 --> 09:25.000
About what?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.720
I hate to be
miss know-it-all...

09:27.720 --> 09:29.960
No, you don't.

09:29.960 --> 09:30.920
Okay, I don't...

Junior High.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.800
I know.

09:39.240 --> 09:41.440
Look, I'm not going
to tell you again

09:41.440 --> 09:43.360
what you can
and can't do, Alex

09:43.360 --> 09:45.400
but you don't want
to do anything

09:45.400 --> 09:48.080
that's going to draw
attention to yourself.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.600
I guess all
I'm saying is

09:49.600 --> 09:50.680
be careful.

09:50.680 --> 09:51.960
I will, Annie.

09:51.960 --> 09:53.360
Okay.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.240
I'm always careful.

09:58.440 --> 10:00.960
Almost always.

10:30.920 --> 10:32.120
Yes!

10:35.480 --> 10:36.360
What's the matter?

10:36.360 --> 10:37.640
Be cool, you're glowing.

10:37.640 --> 10:38.600
Oh, no.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.160
It'll go away
in a second.

10:40.160 --> 10:41.440
It sometimes happens

10:41.440 --> 10:43.480
when my heart
beats really fast.

10:44.920 --> 10:45.800
Better?

10:45.800 --> 10:46.760
Yeah.

10:46.760 --> 10:47.800
Okay, come on.

10:49.760 --> 10:50.640
All right

10:50.640 --> 10:51.840
nice work, you two.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.640
Now, when you
pass the baton

10:53.640 --> 10:55.480
you have to trust
each other.

10:55.480 --> 10:56.520
How did it feel?

10:56.520 --> 10:57.480
It felt great.

10:57.480 --> 10:58.440
Yeah, fine.

10:58.440 --> 10:59.640
Okay. Our first test

10:59.640 --> 11:01.960
is against Peaceful
View on Saturday.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.320
Yeah, district champs.

11:03.320 --> 11:06.080
We can still give them
a fight, right?

11:06.080 --> 11:07.040
Right.

11:07.040 --> 11:08.000
All right, then.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.200
<i>( Exhales deeply )</i>

against peaceful?

11:14.680 --> 11:16.080
Not in all the events

11:16.080 --> 11:19.160
but I do like our chances
in the shuttle relay.

11:19.160 --> 11:20.120
Thanks.

11:20.120 --> 11:21.160
All right.

11:22.120 --> 11:23.200
Ray, this so cool.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.720
And to be
running anchor?

11:24.720 --> 11:25.960
I can't believe it.

11:25.960 --> 11:27.640
I thought
you'd run anchor.

11:27.640 --> 11:28.720
Yeah, so did I.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.480
But hey,
if it can't be me

11:30.480 --> 11:32.040
I'm glad
it's you, Alex.

11:32.040 --> 11:34.640
Alex:
What's that doing here?

11:34.640 --> 11:36.360
No idea, but let's go.

11:36.360 --> 11:37.400
Yeah.

11:39.880 --> 11:42.440
Alex: What's Vince
doing with Miss Clark?

11:48.360 --> 11:50.440
Ray: Hey,
what's going on?

11:56.320 --> 11:57.760
Let's go.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.400
<i>Alex:
Maybe Miss Clark and Vince</i>

12:03.400 --> 12:04.560
are old friends.

12:04.560 --> 12:06.320
Or maybe
they're dating.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.760
I don't know, Alex.

12:07.760 --> 12:10.160
It's hard picturing
Vince dating anyone.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.120
Yeah.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.800
But why would Miss Clark

12:12.800 --> 12:14.640
be handing him envelopes?

12:14.640 --> 12:16.000
Handing who envelopes?

12:16.000 --> 12:17.760
Nothing.

12:17.760 --> 12:20.600
Oh, come on, you're covering up.

12:20.600 --> 12:21.360
What?

12:21.360 --> 12:22.680
No big deal, Annie.

12:22.680 --> 12:25.600
We saw Miss Clark handing
Vince this big envelope.

12:25.600 --> 12:26.360
But so what?

12:26.360 --> 12:27.520
What?!
Ray!

12:27.520 --> 12:30.520
Good old Ms. Clark

12:30.520 --> 12:32.440
the world's greatest teacher.

12:32.440 --> 12:35.040
Alex, forget about
Ms. Clark, and forget

12:35.040 --> 12:36.360
about the track team.

12:36.360 --> 12:37.640
Annie, I respect you

12:37.640 --> 12:40.480
but this is Miss Clark
you're talking about.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.800
You can't ditch her
or the team.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.240
We need you.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.640
I'm not going
to ditch the team.

12:46.640 --> 12:47.920
Not yet, anyway.

12:47.920 --> 12:48.960
<i>( Sighs )</i>

12:53.200 --> 12:57.200
Mitch Gumpstein was seen making
very unusual noises

12:57.200 --> 12:59.200
in sixth period biology.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.760
A gurgling sound.

13:00.760 --> 13:04.520
When asked, Mitch,
a seventh-grader, only replied

13:04.520 --> 13:05.800
"Super Burrito."

13:05.800 --> 13:09.520
That was from Mr. Krantz,
the science teacher.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.320
<i>( Burps loudly )</i>

13:11.320 --> 13:12.280
Excuse me.

13:12.280 --> 13:13.440
I don't know.

13:13.440 --> 13:15.040
It sounds
inconclusive to me.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.600
You've read me 30 reports

13:16.600 --> 13:18.880
and other than
a few gurgling stomachs

13:18.880 --> 13:21.520
and the kid with
the double-jointed shoulder

13:21.520 --> 13:22.640
I have nothing.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.880
Is this what you're
about-- nothing?

13:24.880 --> 13:27.160
Give me some
observable phenomenon.

13:27.160 --> 13:28.400
Hang on,
Miss Atron.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.960
The best is yet to come.

13:29.960 --> 13:32.000
Read it, Vinnie...
I mean, Vince.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.160
<i>( Rats squeaking )</i>

13:33.160 --> 13:35.960
Okay, this is
from the history teacher

13:35.960 --> 13:38.600
who also serves
as the track coach.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.920
"No observable differences
to report as yet.

13:41.920 --> 13:46.240
"However, the big track meet
should serve as an ideal test

13:46.240 --> 13:49.120
"for unusual, physical
characteristics.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.120
Miss Clark."

13:51.320 --> 13:53.960
See, the track meet.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.360
Beautiful.

13:56.840 --> 13:58.480
Um...
I'm not convinced.

13:58.480 --> 14:01.800
I mean, this isn't
what I'd envisioned at all.

14:01.800 --> 14:05.440
Involving civilians like this
is highly dangerous.

14:05.440 --> 14:06.800
I need results.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.680
What was I thinking
when I allowed myself

14:09.680 --> 14:11.400
to be talked into this?

14:11.400 --> 14:13.600
I never liked the idea.

14:13.600 --> 14:14.920
<i>( Rats squeaking )</i>

15:02.360 --> 15:03.960
<i>( Door slams )</i>

15:14.520 --> 15:18.080
The forms say "P.V. Chemical
student observation report."

15:18.080 --> 15:21.040
Miss Clark is keeping tabs
on us for the Plant.

15:21.040 --> 15:23.720
I guess this means
no more track for you.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.040
No more relay team.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.480
I don't know what to do.

15:26.480 --> 15:28.360
I love being
on the track team.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.360
I've never been
on a team before.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.720
But what if Miss Clark
sees me glowing?

15:32.720 --> 15:34.160
Tomorrow's the meet.

15:34.160 --> 15:37.160
I don't know if we
can find somebody else.

15:37.160 --> 15:38.200
It isn't fair, Ray.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.840
I deserve to be
on that team.

15:39.840 --> 15:41.800
It's all
because of them.

15:45.800 --> 15:46.720
<i>Alex:
Mom?</i>

15:46.720 --> 15:47.920
Surprise, honey.

15:47.920 --> 15:50.480
A special carbo-load dinner
for that meet.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.800
Now, remember,
your body is a temple.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.160
The meet's been canceled.

15:54.160 --> 15:55.680
What did you say?

15:55.680 --> 15:56.760
Canceled.

15:56.760 --> 15:57.720
Why?

15:57.720 --> 15:59.680
Well, the track...

15:59.680 --> 16:01.760
It's too muddy.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.640
It's a muddy track.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.600
That's a good boy.

16:09.600 --> 16:10.360
<i>( Kissing )</i>

16:10.360 --> 16:11.640
What're you doing?

16:11.640 --> 16:12.600

16:12.600 --> 16:14.560
Show me your stuff.

<i>( Rat squeaking )</i>

16:17.840 --> 16:19.480
What do you want?

16:19.480 --> 16:20.920
Nothing.

16:20.920 --> 16:22.200
Nothing?

16:22.200 --> 16:26.680
Then what are you
doing here?

16:28.040 --> 16:28.920
My plan.

16:28.920 --> 16:30.960
What if it doesn't
work out?

16:30.960 --> 16:32.880
You should have
thought of that

16:32.880 --> 16:35.400
before you opened
your big mouth, David.

16:35.400 --> 16:36.400
I know.

Oh, come on,
Dave, be a man.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.360
She's going
to fire me.

16:44.360 --> 16:48.400
She could have fired you
a long time ago

16:48.400 --> 16:49.880
but she didn't.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.560
<i>( Rat squeaking )</i>

16:51.560 --> 16:52.560
I'm scared.

16:52.560 --> 16:54.440
Look... it's not
your fault.

16:54.440 --> 16:58.120
If I hadn't sent those shock
waves through your brain

16:58.120 --> 17:00.800
you never would have
thought about it.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.960
Do you still hate me?

17:04.960 --> 17:05.920
Yes.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.560
But things could change

17:07.560 --> 17:10.760
if we get results
at the track meet tomorrow.

17:18.839 --> 17:19.920
Ray, this is Ryan.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.280
He's a pole vaulter.

17:21.280 --> 17:23.200
He'll run third
and you'll anchor

17:23.200 --> 17:25.119
if Alex really
doesn't show up.

17:25.119 --> 17:26.640
She's not going
to show up

17:26.640 --> 17:29.080
so do what
you're going to do.

17:29.080 --> 17:30.880
Don't worry
about running fast.

17:30.880 --> 17:32.720
The hand-off
is most important.

17:32.720 --> 17:35.720
Just don't drop the thing
and we have a chance.

17:38.720 --> 17:40.080
Vince:
Excuse me.

17:40.080 --> 17:41.600
<i>( Whistles )</i>

17:41.600 --> 17:43.360
I'll be right back, Ray.

17:43.360 --> 17:44.440
Go loosen up.

17:53.880 --> 17:57.480
When was the Spanish Civil War
and how did it end?

17:57.480 --> 18:00.960
1936 to 1939, when Madrid fell
to Franco's army.

18:00.960 --> 18:03.480
You know the subject matter
pretty well.

18:03.480 --> 18:04.440
I'm impressed.

18:04.440 --> 18:06.000
It's Miss Clark's class.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.280
She makes history seem
so important.

18:08.280 --> 18:09.760
It doesn't make sense.

18:09.760 --> 18:12.080
Alex, you can't run in that race

18:12.080 --> 18:13.680
so just
forget about it.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.600
My team is counting on me.

18:15.600 --> 18:18.600
Is the team more important
than your safety?

18:18.600 --> 18:22.480
I can't live my whole life being
afraid of the Plant, Annie.

18:26.120 --> 18:30.760
One, two, three, four, five...

18:30.760 --> 18:31.720
All:
Break!

18:31.720 --> 18:33.360
There you go!

18:33.360 --> 18:34.400
Yes!

18:36.880 --> 18:41.320
Man: The last event of the
day, the shuttle relay.

18:43.040 --> 18:45.280
And may the best team win?

18:49.320 --> 18:51.520
I got a cousin
in Peaceful View.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.440
He can't stand that place.

18:53.440 --> 18:54.400
Alex:
Ray!

18:54.400 --> 18:56.560
What are you doing?

18:56.560 --> 18:57.600
Vince and Dave are here.

18:57.600 --> 18:58.680
I don't care.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.200
I want to run anyway.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.160
Man:
Runners to your marks.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.840
Great, I'll take over
for Ryan

19:03.840 --> 19:05.120
and you are our anchor

19:05.120 --> 19:07.000
against Mr. happiness
over here.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.840

20:21.000 --> 20:22.080
My career in track

20:23.320 --> 20:25.200
I'm going to tell Miss Clark

20:25.200 --> 20:26.920

20:26.920 --> 20:27.720
Nice running.

20:31.160 --> 20:32.200
Yeah.

20:43.600 --> 20:46.440
Vince: You agreed to
participate, Miss Clark.

20:46.440 --> 20:48.480
I'm sorry,
I'm withdrawing.

20:48.480 --> 20:49.760
Look, I don't know

20:49.760 --> 20:51.440
what you really want

20:51.440 --> 20:53.080
but I did my own research.

20:53.080 --> 20:54.480
You work for the Plant

20:54.480 --> 20:55.760
as head of security.

20:55.760 --> 20:57.360
What does head of security

20:57.360 --> 20:59.640
have to do with this?

20:59.640 --> 21:01.800
I do a lot of projects
for Miss Atron.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.400
Miss Clark:
Well, that may be so

21:03.400 --> 21:04.600
but I no longer buy

21:04.600 --> 21:07.080
your "child athlete
of the year" stuff.

21:07.080 --> 21:09.280
If you would like me to speak

21:09.280 --> 21:11.040
to Miss Atron personally

21:11.040 --> 21:12.120
I'd be happy to.

21:12.120 --> 21:13.640
Oh, please don't mention

21:13.640 --> 21:14.800
my name if you do.

21:14.800 --> 21:15.880
As I said...

21:15.880 --> 21:18.040
I won't be
filling out your forms.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.360
Please leave.

21:19.360 --> 21:22.120
Not until those forms
are filled out.

21:22.120 --> 21:24.200
Then you'll be here
a long time.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.080
You want to cha-cha
with me?

21:26.080 --> 21:27.520
We can get

I'll be speaking again with you
real soon, Miss Clark.

21:59.240 --> 22:00.200
Nice race, Alex.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.160
I heard a rumor

22:01.160 --> 22:02.840
that you might not
make it.

22:02.840 --> 22:03.920
I'm glad I did.

22:03.920 --> 22:06.000
I actually stood up
for my beliefs.

22:06.000 --> 22:06.960
In what way?

22:06.960 --> 22:08.000
It's a long story

as the Spanish
Civil War, though.

22:11.320 --> 22:14.480
Really?
I'd love to hear it.

22:14.480 --> 22:15.480
Maybe someday.
