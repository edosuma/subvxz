WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:04.127
Where were you last night?

00:04.162 --> 00:06.088
I was at the library
with Darien.

00:06.123 --> 00:08.790
Again? You guys
are practically dating.

00:08.825 --> 00:11.143
World's most boring
dating, but dating.

00:11.178 --> 00:12.786
Yeah, I wish, okay.

00:12.821 --> 00:15.346
He hasn't even asked me out yet,

00:15.382 --> 00:18.191
and I don't know why because
we definitely have chemistry,

00:18.226 --> 00:20.960
- in fourth period, and in person.
- ( Marisa laughs )

00:20.996 --> 00:23.771
- Hey, KC.
- Oh, hey, what's up, Darien?

00:23.807 --> 00:26.692
So I was wondering if you've
seen that new alien movie yet.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.544
No, no. I'm not really
a huge sci-fi fan.

00:29.580 --> 00:33.256
Oh. That's too bad.

00:33.291 --> 00:36.334
I heard about this new
Argentinean steak place.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.454
It's supposed to be great.

00:38.456 --> 00:39.888
Yeah, well, I'm gonna
have to take your word for it,

00:39.923 --> 00:41.603
because I'm a vegetarian.

00:44.278 --> 00:46.286
Oh, I forgot.

00:46.321 --> 00:49.080
So are there any good
vegetarian places

00:49.115 --> 00:51.166
you could recommend?
I'd love to try one.

00:51.202 --> 00:53.377
Of course,
I'd hate to eat alone.

00:53.412 --> 00:55.262
Yeah, for sure.

00:55.297 --> 00:57.122
There's a really good one
on Clark Street.

00:57.157 --> 00:59.123
They actually have
communal tables,

00:59.159 --> 01:01.239
so you can meet
a lot of interesting people.

01:08.018 --> 01:09.618
Uh, okay.
So I'll just see you later.

01:09.653 --> 01:11.520
All right.

01:11.555 --> 01:13.780
He is so cute!

01:13.815 --> 01:16.107
Why won't he just
ask me out already?

01:16.143 --> 01:19.727
He just did. Three times.

01:19.763 --> 01:22.689
What do you think
the movie and the steak,

01:22.725 --> 01:26.818
and the "where can I eat
vegetarian not alone" was about?

01:26.854 --> 01:29.662
Darien, wait up!
I wanna try the steak place.

01:29.698 --> 01:32.065
They have salads, right?

01:32.100 --> 01:35.694
¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶

01:35.729 --> 01:38.889
¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶

01:38.966 --> 01:42.843
¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep things hustle cool ¶

01:42.878 --> 01:46.905
¶ I'll always find a way,
a way out of the fire ¶

01:46.941 --> 01:50.650
¶ Don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶

01:50.685 --> 01:52.744
¶ I'm not perfect ¶

01:52.780 --> 01:56.815
¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶

01:56.850 --> 02:00.752
¶ But I, I, I,
I keep it undercover ¶

02:00.788 --> 02:02.862
¶ Livin' my life,
no way to learn ¶

02:02.897 --> 02:05.140
¶ Doin' my thing,
gonna make it work ¶

02:05.175 --> 02:07.283
¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby, I'm fearless ¶

02:07.319 --> 02:09.394
¶ But I always got your back ¶

02:09.429 --> 02:11.280
¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶

02:11.315 --> 02:13.523
¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶

02:13.558 --> 02:16.159
¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶

02:16.194 --> 02:17.510
¶ It's all part of the plan ¶

02:17.545 --> 02:19.913
I keep it undercover.

02:19.948 --> 02:21.548
I keep it undercover.

02:25.603 --> 02:26.795
- So I'll pick you up Saturday night?
- Yeah, yeah.

02:26.830 --> 02:28.821
I'm not gonna be picking you up,

02:28.857 --> 02:30.574
you know, 'cause
you're twice my size.

02:30.609 --> 02:31.900
( Awkward laughter )

02:31.935 --> 02:33.175
All right, that's cool.

02:37.065 --> 02:38.248
Hey, Ernie, how's it going?

02:38.283 --> 02:40.234
Me Ernie?

02:40.269 --> 02:43.203
Yes, you Ernie.

02:43.238 --> 02:44.998
I'm good. Thanks for asking.

02:54.925 --> 02:57.025
What just happened?

02:57.060 --> 03:01.354
It's contact popularity.

03:01.390 --> 03:04.850
When a popular guy
like Darien says hi to you,

03:04.885 --> 03:06.735
people think that
you're more important

03:06.770 --> 03:08.562
than you really are.

03:08.597 --> 03:11.014
It's like you're cool-adjacent.

03:11.049 --> 03:13.809
That's pathetic.

03:13.844 --> 03:15.894
I'll take it.

03:18.807 --> 03:22.359
All right, Marisa, do not
go all crazy, all right,

03:22.394 --> 03:25.903
but I have my first official date
with Darien this Saturday night.

03:25.939 --> 03:29.241
( High-pitched shriek )

03:31.645 --> 03:34.454
I'm glad you didn't
go all crazy.

03:34.490 --> 03:36.406
Yes, I'm excited, too,

03:36.441 --> 03:38.400
okay, but I'm also very nervous.

03:38.435 --> 03:41.053
I've never really been
on a real date before.

03:41.129 --> 03:42.245
What about when you went
to the dance with Lincoln?

03:42.280 --> 03:44.397
Mission.

03:44.433 --> 03:45.081
What about when you
went to the movies with Brett?

03:45.116 --> 03:47.375
Mission.

03:47.411 --> 03:48.601
What about that guy
you made out with at camp?

03:48.636 --> 03:50.311
He was not a mission.

03:50.346 --> 03:52.472
No, he was imaginary.

03:52.507 --> 03:54.057
I made him up.

03:54.092 --> 03:56.359
That is too bad.

03:56.394 --> 03:58.186
You guys really seemed to click.

04:03.835 --> 04:06.027
Hey, Dad, I just
wanted to let you know

04:06.063 --> 04:06.869
that I have
a date Saturday night.

04:06.905 --> 04:08.955
Let me guess.

04:08.990 --> 04:12.200
With the guy from summer camp?

04:12.235 --> 04:14.085
No.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.430
It's a real date with a real guy

04:16.465 --> 04:18.481
that actually exists.

04:18.516 --> 04:21.768
Oh. Okay, well, have fun.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.929
That's it?

04:23.964 --> 04:25.380
You don't wanna know
anything about him

04:25.416 --> 04:27.273
or meet him before we go out?

04:27.309 --> 04:28.950
KC, the last guy
you were interested in

04:28.986 --> 04:31.244
tried to kill you.

04:31.279 --> 04:33.239
I say anyone
is a step up from that.

04:34.483 --> 04:35.723
( Knocking at door )

04:41.548 --> 04:44.173
Hi. Is this
the Cooper residence?

04:44.208 --> 04:45.858
That depends. Who's asking?

04:45.894 --> 04:48.720
Oh, sorry. Hi. I'm Abby Martin.

04:48.755 --> 04:50.155
I just moved to D.C.
from Chicago.

04:50.190 --> 04:52.390
That's great.

04:52.425 --> 04:54.909
So sorry I didn't
pick you up from the airport,

04:54.944 --> 04:57.970
probably because I don't
know who you are.

04:58.006 --> 05:00.582
Right. Of course you don't,

05:00.617 --> 05:03.251
because I'm a total stranger
showing up at your door.

05:03.287 --> 05:05.269
I'm originally from Evanston,

05:05.305 --> 05:06.687
I'm a freshman at
Howard University,

05:06.723 --> 05:08.648
I live at the Wheatley dorm,

05:08.684 --> 05:10.650
and what was the other thing?

05:10.686 --> 05:13.046
Oh, yeah, I think
we might be related.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.738
( Clears throat ) Excuse me.

05:15.774 --> 05:17.281
Could you just
back that up a little bit?

05:17.317 --> 05:20.068
Oh, uh, I'm originally
from Evanston...

05:20.103 --> 05:21.944
Yeah, I meant the related part.

05:21.980 --> 05:23.379
Right. Um...

05:23.415 --> 05:25.740
Here's the thing.

05:25.775 --> 05:27.083
My dad passed away recently.

05:27.119 --> 05:28.417
I never really knew my mom.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.312
So I started researching her,

05:30.347 --> 05:31.796
and public records
led me to you.

05:31.832 --> 05:36.585
Oh, I'm pretty sure
I'm not your mother.

05:36.620 --> 05:38.260
And not just because
you're older than me.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.975
Actually, my mom passed away
when I was really young.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.936
Totally sad, I know.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.570
But what can you do?

05:47.605 --> 05:50.182
Guess I'm like
Little Orphan Annie

05:50.217 --> 05:52.697
without all the fun
singing and dancing.

05:52.727 --> 05:55.736
Anyway...

05:55.772 --> 05:58.924
uh, I'm actually
looking for Kira Cooper.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.517
Her maiden name is King?

06:01.552 --> 06:02.469
I think she might be
my mother's sister.

06:02.504 --> 06:05.438
I'm... I'm sorry,

06:05.473 --> 06:07.523
but I think you might've
found the wrong Kira Cooper,

06:07.559 --> 06:10.518
'cause my mom
never had a sister.

06:10.553 --> 06:12.570
But... good luck.

06:12.606 --> 06:15.824
Okay. Thanks.
Sorry to bother you.

06:15.859 --> 06:18.410
It's all good.

06:18.445 --> 06:20.036
Oh, hey, Mom.

06:20.072 --> 06:22.121
That was really weird.

06:22.156 --> 06:24.223
She was saying that
you might be her aunt,

06:24.259 --> 06:25.292
but I told her that
you didn't have a sister.

06:25.327 --> 06:27.878
Actually, um...

06:27.913 --> 06:30.255
we need to talk.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.385
I cannot believe
that I have an aunt

06:36.421 --> 06:37.754
that I never even knew about.

06:37.789 --> 06:40.123
How could you keep this from me?

06:40.158 --> 06:42.659
- Why didn't you tell me about this?
- KC, calm down.

06:42.694 --> 06:45.278
I can't believe you have a
sister that I never knew about.

06:45.313 --> 06:47.396
Why wouldn't you tell me this?

06:47.432 --> 06:50.383
Why would you keep this from me?

06:50.418 --> 06:51.843
I think we're missing
the big picture here.

06:51.878 --> 06:55.330
I have a late aunt who may
have left me a small fortune.

06:55.365 --> 06:58.224
Will you all be quiet
and let me explain?

06:58.260 --> 07:01.770
Sit down.

07:01.805 --> 07:04.355
Kira said her sister was the
black sheep of the family.

07:04.391 --> 07:07.584
- Judy!
- What?

07:07.619 --> 07:09.152
You were taking too long,
so I accessed the files.

07:09.187 --> 07:10.637
This is my story to tell.

07:10.672 --> 07:12.172
Let's move it along, shall we?

07:15.586 --> 07:17.185
Anyway, my sister Erica and I

07:17.220 --> 07:19.529
really never got along.

07:19.565 --> 07:21.056
Didn't have that in
your files, did you, Judy?

07:21.091 --> 07:23.699
Actually, I did,

07:23.735 --> 07:26.410
I just didn't think
it was my place

07:26.446 --> 07:28.772
to bring up
your personal business.

07:28.807 --> 07:31.482
As I was saying,

07:31.517 --> 07:33.317
after Erica learned
that my parents and I

07:33.353 --> 07:34.844
were part of the Organization,

07:34.879 --> 07:36.546
she joined the Other Side.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.514
Wait, wait.

07:38.549 --> 07:40.366
Your sister joined
the Other Side?

07:40.402 --> 07:43.645
Yes, and it broke our hearts.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.313
My parents got rid
of everything that showed

07:45.349 --> 07:47.232
she ever existed.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.858
They figured it'd be
easier that way.

07:48.893 --> 07:50.868
But I managed to save
a few pictures

07:50.904 --> 07:52.069
from when we were kids,
'cause no matter what,

07:52.105 --> 07:55.265
she was my sister.

07:55.267 --> 07:56.574
Judy, I want you to access
my personal computer.

07:56.610 --> 07:59.627
- My password is...
- I already figured out your secret password.

07:59.662 --> 08:00.845
SpyMom1?

08:02.858 --> 08:04.841
I thought it was ILoveCraig.

08:04.876 --> 08:07.218
No, honey, that's your password.

08:07.253 --> 08:09.779
Oh, yeah, that's right.

08:09.815 --> 08:11.272
Lights off.

08:14.444 --> 08:17.929
Pulling up super secret
sister pictures.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.598
I loved my sister,

08:19.633 --> 08:21.953
but she never really fit in
with the rest of the family.

08:26.389 --> 08:29.624
She just walked to the beat
of her own drum.

08:29.659 --> 08:32.260
I can relate.

08:32.295 --> 08:35.004
And after college,
when Erica found out

08:35.039 --> 08:36.823
that I was recruited
to be a spy like our parents,

08:36.858 --> 08:37.841
she really felt left out.

08:37.876 --> 08:40.518
I can relate.

08:40.553 --> 08:43.221
She was always a little off,

08:43.256 --> 08:44.976
doing weird things,
acting all strange.

08:47.778 --> 08:49.803
And sometimes,
it was just embarrassing

08:49.838 --> 08:51.087
being in the same family.

08:51.123 --> 08:52.797
Oh, look at that.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.358
Now I can relate.

08:55.394 --> 08:57.686
Erica and I never spoke again

08:57.721 --> 08:59.295
after she joined the Other Side.

08:59.331 --> 09:01.714
That was almost 20 years ago.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.584
It was hard, but sometimes,

09:04.619 --> 09:07.921
you just have to know
when to let go.

09:07.956 --> 09:09.831
Now that she's really gone...

09:09.866 --> 09:11.582
Mom, Mom, Mom.

09:11.617 --> 09:13.976
Hey, on the bright side,
we got Abby now.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.620
She is a part of the family.

09:15.655 --> 09:17.388
We could always
reach out to her.

09:17.423 --> 09:19.324
Oh, no. Uh-uh. Absolutely not.

09:19.359 --> 09:21.518
I got a bad feeling
about this whole thing.

09:21.553 --> 09:23.611
But we're the only family
that she has.

09:23.647 --> 09:25.527
KC, enough.
I'm shutting this down.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.726
Hey, is that a picture
of you in a hot tub?

09:29.761 --> 09:31.311
With MC Hammer?

09:36.150 --> 09:37.910
I'm shutting that down, too.

09:42.965 --> 09:44.874
Okay, hypothetical
question, right?

09:44.876 --> 09:46.651
Let's just say I'm
on my date with Darien tonight,

09:46.686 --> 09:49.879
and I pass out from nervousness.

09:49.914 --> 09:52.940
Now, is it better
to faint into my food,

09:52.976 --> 09:54.534
or onto the floor?

09:54.569 --> 09:55.927
If it were me,
I would just faint

09:55.962 --> 09:59.338
right into his arms,
but that is an advanced move,

09:59.374 --> 10:01.057
and you may not be ready for it.

10:01.092 --> 10:03.351
Marisa, I'm serious, all right.

10:03.386 --> 10:06.154
I really, really like this guy,

10:06.189 --> 10:08.264
and I need your help. What
if he thinks I'm boring?

10:08.299 --> 10:10.166
Boring? Please,
you have traveled the world.

10:10.202 --> 10:12.493
You've met royalty.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.754
You have been in the same
room as the president.

10:14.789 --> 10:17.148
All things I cannot tell him.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.400
Everything that's
unique about me

10:18.435 --> 10:20.668
is classified.

10:20.704 --> 10:24.064
Or gross, like the
plantar's wart on my foot.

10:25.099 --> 10:26.882
Okay, little hint.

10:26.918 --> 10:29.469
Try not to mention
your warts to him.

10:29.504 --> 10:32.630
Or anyone. Ever.

10:32.665 --> 10:36.267
So basically,
all I can tell him is...

10:36.303 --> 10:38.444
I have a great family,
I go to school,

10:38.479 --> 10:40.221
and I come home
to my great family.

10:40.256 --> 10:41.339
Then make something up.

10:43.509 --> 10:45.051
This date needs to go well.

10:45.086 --> 10:46.428
We need this.

10:46.463 --> 10:48.062
Why do you care?

10:48.098 --> 10:49.572
Thanks to him,

10:49.607 --> 10:50.882
I'm popular-adjacent.

10:50.917 --> 10:52.708
Since he acknowledged me,

10:52.743 --> 10:54.844
I've gotten 13 "Heys,"
ten "'Sups,"

10:54.880 --> 10:56.879
and I passed a group of
people talking about a party,

10:56.914 --> 10:58.865
and for the first time
in my life,

10:58.942 --> 11:00.308
the conversation didn't
come to a screeching halt.

11:00.343 --> 11:02.527
Marisa, help her!

11:04.964 --> 11:07.507
Okay, KC, here's
all the dating advice

11:07.542 --> 11:09.275
you will ever need.

11:09.310 --> 11:11.427
If you can't be interesting,

11:11.462 --> 11:14.072
then be interested.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.032
Guys love to talk
about themselves,

11:16.067 --> 11:18.142
so just talk about
things he likes.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.553
Oh, we'll treat this
like a mission.

11:20.588 --> 11:22.488
I'll find out
everything Darien likes,

11:22.523 --> 11:24.357
put together a dossier,
and prep you.

11:24.392 --> 11:25.883
Okay, guys, come on.

11:25.918 --> 11:29.629
This seems a little weird,
creepy, and super stalkery.

11:29.664 --> 11:31.104
Yeah, welcome to
the world of dating.

11:32.241 --> 11:33.766
No one goes in cold anymore.

11:36.620 --> 11:39.130
Now in case all else fails,

11:39.165 --> 11:41.674
you are also
gonna need a go-to story.

11:41.709 --> 11:43.142
Okay, I know I'm gonna
hate myself for asking,

11:43.177 --> 11:44.819
but what is a go-to story?

11:44.854 --> 11:46.662
It is a story that
makes you seem sweet,

11:46.697 --> 11:48.964
vulnerable and lovable,

11:49.000 --> 11:51.276
preferably featuring
a small, helpless animal.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.960
Yeah, I don't have one of those.

11:52.995 --> 11:54.778
Oh, you can borrow mine.

11:54.814 --> 11:56.631
I got it from my friend
Angela in Connecticut.

11:56.666 --> 11:58.791
Now listen and learn.

12:01.095 --> 12:02.420
I was almost seven.

12:05.082 --> 12:08.326
I had begged my parents
for months to get me a puppy.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.321
Then on my birthday,
they got me...

12:10.347 --> 12:13.473
Mr. Doodles.

12:13.508 --> 12:17.335
I took him for a walk,
but the collar was too big.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.654
He got loose,
and out of nowhere,

12:19.689 --> 12:20.713
a car came barreling
down the street...

12:20.749 --> 12:23.390
This is ridiculous.

12:23.426 --> 12:26.703
No one is going to buy
this manipulative, ridiculous...

12:26.738 --> 12:29.530
Poor sweet, vulnerable,
lovable Marisa.

12:32.502 --> 12:33.826
Go on, I'm listening.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.504
Where did you get those pants?

12:45.540 --> 12:47.690
These? I've had these for years.

12:47.726 --> 12:50.317
I guess I never
told you about 'em.

12:50.353 --> 12:51.552
Kinda like you never
told me about your sister.

12:51.587 --> 12:54.063
Hmm.

12:54.098 --> 12:56.482
I wonder what else
you're not telling me.

12:56.517 --> 12:59.493
Fine. I didn't want you to know,

12:59.529 --> 13:01.603
but I guess I have no choice.

13:01.639 --> 13:03.514
I'm not really your wife.

13:03.549 --> 13:04.832
I'm working deep undercover,

13:04.868 --> 13:06.468
( deep voice )
and my real name is Frank.

13:08.254 --> 13:09.545
Don't ask me where
them kids came from,

13:09.580 --> 13:11.973
because I don't know.

13:12.008 --> 13:15.117
Fine. If you're not
gonna take me seriously,

13:15.152 --> 13:17.370
I have no choice but to
go play golf with Stu.

13:17.405 --> 13:19.346
Stu? Who's Stu?

13:19.382 --> 13:21.249
I have secrets, too, woman.

13:27.006 --> 13:29.340
You dragged that brush
through your hair 36 times.

13:29.375 --> 13:32.860
I didn't think it was gonna
get any better after 35,

13:32.896 --> 13:35.605
but boy, you proved me wrong.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.915
Don't you have someplace to be,

13:37.951 --> 13:39.976
like a scrap heap?

13:45.058 --> 13:47.441
Oh, look at you.

13:47.477 --> 13:49.710
Gorgeous. Okay, remember

13:49.746 --> 13:51.888
not to use your phone
during the date,

13:51.923 --> 13:53.364
except to check if
there's spinach in your teeth.

13:53.399 --> 13:56.433
And if Marisa gave you
any advice, ignore it.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.352
And most important...

13:58.387 --> 14:00.605
Okay, Mom, please. I'm
nervous enough as it is.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.399
You're gonna give
my pit stains pit stains.

14:03.434 --> 14:05.601
Can't a mother give her daughter
a little dating advice?

14:05.637 --> 14:07.320
Is that what Grandma
used to do for you?

14:07.355 --> 14:09.688
No, but my older sis...
Never mind.

14:09.724 --> 14:11.140
You were gonna say
sister, weren't you?

14:11.176 --> 14:12.775
Yes, I was.

14:12.810 --> 14:16.329
Sister Mary Elizabeth.

14:16.364 --> 14:19.156
She was one of my teachers
at parochial school.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.250
And for a woman
who was married to God,

14:21.285 --> 14:22.476
she knew a lot about dating.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.141
Okay, Mom, I can clearly see
that you're hurting about this.

14:28.176 --> 14:30.159
Why don't you just
reach out to Abby?

14:30.161 --> 14:32.412
She's your niece. She
deserves to know her family.

14:32.488 --> 14:36.132
KC, she is a stranger
who showed up at our door.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.591
We don't have any proof that
she is who she says she is.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.118
We don't have
any proof that she's not.

14:39.154 --> 14:41.312
Okay, well, say she is my niece.

14:41.347 --> 14:43.155
If she's anything
like her mother,

14:43.191 --> 14:45.133
- that girl is no good.
- You don't know that.

14:45.209 --> 14:46.225
Just because her mom's bad
does not mean that she is.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.577
It's true.

14:48.613 --> 14:50.254
Not everybody turns out
like their parents.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.090
My mother was a coffee machine.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.193
KC, look, I'm done
talking about this.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.687
Mom, we could just call her...

14:57.722 --> 15:00.081
No! This conversation is over.

15:00.116 --> 15:02.424
I don't want anyone
from this family

15:02.460 --> 15:05.900
to have any contact whatsoever
with that Abby girl.

15:08.983 --> 15:10.774
Wow. At least when
my mom got that hot,

15:10.810 --> 15:12.650
you'd get some coffee out of it.

15:16.941 --> 15:18.449
All right, let's review.

15:18.484 --> 15:20.801
What's Darien's favorite
thing to do on the weekend?

15:20.837 --> 15:22.195
- Motocross racing.
- Favorite food.

15:22.230 --> 15:23.387
His grandma's salmon croquettes.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.906
Favorite Harry Potter movie.

15:24.941 --> 15:27.249
Trick question.
He loves them all.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.836
You're ready.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.473
Now go out there
and make me popular...

15:34.508 --> 15:37.051
I mean proud. Proud.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.046
Change of plans, KC.

15:41.082 --> 15:42.999
You have an emergency
extraction mission.

15:43.034 --> 15:44.266
Okay, Dad, I love you,
but I am not squeezing

15:44.302 --> 15:46.477
your back pimples ever again.

15:46.513 --> 15:49.288
This is Organization business.

15:49.324 --> 15:51.324
You can't do this to us!
She has a date.

15:51.359 --> 15:52.639
I'm this close to being popular.

15:56.756 --> 16:00.148
Dad, can't the mission wait
until 10:00 or 11:00 tonight?

16:00.184 --> 16:02.785
Yeah, I'm sure the agent
who's been captured

16:02.821 --> 16:04.453
won't mind waiting a few hours.

16:04.488 --> 16:06.738
Maybe they'll give him
some coconut water

16:06.774 --> 16:08.750
- and a foot massage.
- Oh, so we're good.

16:08.785 --> 16:10.501
Get in the van.

16:16.292 --> 16:18.025
Okay, KC, an agent
from the Organization

16:18.061 --> 16:19.693
has been captured
by the Other Side.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.770
<i>Intel shows that
they might be holding him</i>

16:21.805 --> 16:22.888
<i>in this apartment.</i>

16:26.802 --> 16:28.836
Hey, Dad, thermal scan
confirms there are two perps

16:28.871 --> 16:30.329
in there with
our compromised agent.

16:30.365 --> 16:33.490
- I'm going in.
- <i>KC, our orders are</i>

16:33.526 --> 16:35.375
- to wait for back-up.
- <i>I can't wait. I have a date,</i>

16:35.411 --> 16:37.836
<i>and an unreasonably
early curfew.</i>

16:37.872 --> 16:39.371
<i>- I'm going in.
- KC, stand down.</i>

16:39.406 --> 16:40.446
I repeat, stand down.

16:42.568 --> 16:44.410
Hey, think fast.

17:04.256 --> 17:06.849
KC! KC, are you there?
KC! Are you there?

17:06.884 --> 17:09.034
I'm right here.

17:09.069 --> 17:12.579
- KC, you could've been seriously hurt.
- But I wasn't.

17:12.615 --> 17:13.739
- But you could've been.
- But I wasn't.

17:13.774 --> 17:14.749
But you could've been.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.992
But again, I wasn't.

17:17.027 --> 17:19.345
That's not the point.

17:19.380 --> 17:23.082
I believe Agent Murphy here
would disagree.

17:23.159 --> 17:25.851
He also thinks that
10:00 is a little bit early

17:25.886 --> 17:27.862
for a curfew,
right, Agent Murphy,

17:27.897 --> 17:29.577
whose life I just saved?

17:35.421 --> 17:38.005
Oh, hey, how'd the mission go?

17:38.040 --> 17:40.841
Oh, I would tell you,
but it's a secret.

17:40.877 --> 17:43.802
Really, Craig? Really?

17:43.837 --> 17:46.321
When are you gonna stop
all this nonsense?

17:46.357 --> 17:48.416
Hey, I'm a man of many secrets.

17:48.451 --> 17:51.569
For instance, did you know
I can burp the entire alphabet?

17:51.604 --> 17:53.020
Wasn't cute on our first date,

17:53.056 --> 17:55.172
and it's not gonna be cute now.

17:55.207 --> 17:57.258
And if you don't
stop acting like a darn fool,

17:57.293 --> 17:59.493
you're gonna be sleeping
on this couch tonight.

18:02.865 --> 18:05.666
Dad, I get that
you're upset with Mom,

18:05.701 --> 18:07.659
but if you wanna
patch things up,

18:07.695 --> 18:09.879
can I give you a little advice?

18:09.914 --> 18:12.506
Stop worrying about
being interesting,

18:12.541 --> 18:14.891
and worry more about
being interested.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.670
What the heck does that mean?

18:17.705 --> 18:19.555
I don't know.

18:19.590 --> 18:20.989
Marisa came up with it.

18:21.024 --> 18:23.125
But I think, in this case,

18:23.161 --> 18:24.902
it means stop making
a big deal about you,

18:24.937 --> 18:26.144
and worry about her.

18:26.180 --> 18:28.881
Huh.

18:28.916 --> 18:31.142
You know, that
actually makes sense.

18:31.177 --> 18:34.370
Thank you, son.

18:34.405 --> 18:38.045
And if that fails, tell her
a story about a dead dog.

18:50.446 --> 18:51.954
I'm here. I'm here.

18:51.990 --> 18:55.808
I'm here. Uh, sorry I'm late.

18:55.844 --> 18:57.301
I just, um, had to
help my dad with something.

18:57.336 --> 18:58.577
Anything interesting?

18:58.612 --> 19:00.854
Interesting? No.

19:00.890 --> 19:03.641
I am not interesting at all.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.942
But I am interested...

19:05.978 --> 19:07.753
in what you like on the menu.

19:07.788 --> 19:10.038
I'm not sure what to get.

19:10.073 --> 19:14.502
How about salmon croquettes?

19:14.537 --> 19:16.720
Because it's a pizza place
and they're not on the menu.

19:16.755 --> 19:19.131
Yeah.

19:19.166 --> 19:21.475
Sure, that's a good reason.

19:21.510 --> 19:23.185
I just love them so much.

19:23.220 --> 19:24.395
I thought you were a vegetarian.

19:24.430 --> 19:27.423
I am.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.992
I am, but I like to pretend
to eat salmon croquettes...

19:32.096 --> 19:34.538
while motocross racing
and reading

19:34.574 --> 19:36.334
all seven Harry Potter books.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.018
I mean, is there a best one?

19:40.054 --> 19:43.380
Don't ask me 'cause
I love them all.

19:43.415 --> 19:45.099
KC, are you randomly
mentioning things that I like?

19:45.134 --> 19:47.301
Why would you say that?

19:47.336 --> 19:49.617
Because you're randomly
mentioning things that I like.

19:51.240 --> 19:52.356
Please tell me you did not
internet-stalk me

19:52.391 --> 19:54.308
to prepare for our date.

19:54.343 --> 19:57.011
No. Of course not.
I would never do that.

19:57.046 --> 19:58.295
That is so weird
and creepy and...

19:58.331 --> 19:59.647
very manipulative.

20:03.828 --> 20:04.828
I was almost seven.

20:07.415 --> 20:10.557
I had begged my parents
for months for a puppy,

20:10.592 --> 20:12.551
and then,
on my birthday, I, um...

20:12.586 --> 20:14.286
I'm sorry.

20:18.901 --> 20:20.660
Here's a little secret for you.

20:20.695 --> 20:22.778
The last time
this blanket was used,

20:22.813 --> 20:24.755
Ernie had the stomach flu
and threw up on it.

20:24.790 --> 20:27.074
Sweet dreams.

20:27.109 --> 20:28.976
Can I tell you a secret?

20:29.011 --> 20:31.795
I can be an idiot sometimes.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.881
Oh, tell me something
I didn't already know.

20:34.917 --> 20:38.560
I was upset because I didn't
know about your sister,

20:38.596 --> 20:40.321
and I acted like a jerk.

20:40.356 --> 20:42.289
What I should've done
was sit you down,

20:42.325 --> 20:46.177
and asked, how you doing, baby?

20:46.212 --> 20:47.928
I know this whole thing
must be really painful.

20:47.964 --> 20:49.763
You okay?

20:49.799 --> 20:51.740
Oh, Craig.

20:55.287 --> 20:58.147
Now if there's
anything else you're hiding,

20:58.182 --> 21:00.007
and you wanna
get it off your chest...

21:00.042 --> 21:01.375
Don't ruin it, Craig.

21:07.441 --> 21:10.717
Thank you.
I had a great time tonight.

21:10.753 --> 21:12.886
Did you? Did you really?

21:15.116 --> 21:16.349
No. ( Laughs )

21:16.384 --> 21:18.309
Neither did I.

21:18.344 --> 21:20.160
Yeah, I'm sorry.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.947
It was horrible,
and it was all my fault.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.265
And the worst part is
I really, really like you,

21:25.301 --> 21:27.418
and I just ruined
my very first date ever.

21:27.453 --> 21:29.127
Okay, wait a minute.

21:29.163 --> 21:30.362
This is your very first date?

21:30.397 --> 21:32.280
Yes.

21:32.316 --> 21:34.183
Now wait another minute.

21:34.218 --> 21:36.538
Did you just say
you really liked me?

21:36.812 --> 21:39.180
Maybe.

21:39.215 --> 21:41.389
KC, I like you, too,

21:41.425 --> 21:43.066
and I wanna get to know you.

21:43.102 --> 21:44.743
Who's the real KC?

21:44.778 --> 21:47.188
Um...

21:47.223 --> 21:50.307
Well, the real me...

21:50.343 --> 21:52.983
The real me has never had a salmon
croquette, and never wants to.

21:54.321 --> 21:57.114
I have no interest
in motocross racing,

21:57.150 --> 21:59.991
and I am way behind
in my Harry Potters.

22:00.027 --> 22:03.870
I guess the real KC is someone

22:03.906 --> 22:08.408
who really, really,
really cares about her family.

22:08.444 --> 22:10.870
They are, like, the most important
thing in the world to me.

22:10.905 --> 22:13.864
I couldn't even imagine
going through life without...

22:18.004 --> 22:19.202
You know what, thank you
so much for everything,

22:19.238 --> 22:21.689
and I really wanna
do this again,

22:21.724 --> 22:24.291
but I gotta go talk to
a family member right now.

22:27.713 --> 22:31.465
Thanks for...
walking me to your door?

22:34.061 --> 22:38.105
So... how'd it go, buddy?

22:38.140 --> 22:39.940
Will we be seeing you again?

22:53.013 --> 22:54.971
Oh, hi.

22:55.007 --> 22:57.391
Hi. Um, I'm sorry.

22:57.426 --> 22:59.309
I didn't get to properly
introduce myself before.

22:59.344 --> 23:03.255
I'm KC Cooper,
and I'm your cousin.

23:03.291 --> 23:11.291
Come on in.
