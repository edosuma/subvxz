WEBVTT

00:00.093 --> 00:02.041
Previously on Madam Secretary...

00:02.041 --> 00:03.137
Jay, it's everything.

00:03.138 --> 00:05.106
We are not a family anymore.

00:05.107 --> 00:06.207
Abby, come on.

00:06.208 --> 00:07.441
I just needed

00:07.442 --> 00:08.376
some time apart.

00:08.377 --> 00:09.810
Virginia Field Force.

00:09.811 --> 00:10.912
Your standard militia group.

00:10.913 --> 00:12.713
Anti-government,
little white supremacy.

00:12.714 --> 00:14.282
I'd like to think about hiring

00:14.283 --> 00:16.484
private security
contractors like Vesuvian.

00:16.485 --> 00:17.618
Pirosmani stole American weapons

00:17.619 --> 00:18.819
and sold them on the black market.

00:18.820 --> 00:19.987
Any idea where he is?

00:19.988 --> 00:21.556
They're trying to track him down,

00:21.557 --> 00:23.690
but he's gone.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:05.700 --> 01:07.335
I tell you,

01:07.336 --> 01:09.804
if I get one more e-mail

01:09.805 --> 01:11.439
about the book fair... I get it.

01:11.440 --> 01:12.840
How did you get on that list?

01:12.841 --> 01:14.041
I signed up

01:14.042 --> 01:16.477
during a 2:00 a.m. guilt trip.

01:16.478 --> 01:17.979
You handle world diplomacy, Mom.

01:17.980 --> 01:19.213
Dad's got the book fair.

01:19.214 --> 01:20.881
You do?

01:20.882 --> 01:23.084
- Babe, books.
- Just so you know,

01:23.085 --> 01:25.219
remainders of your book on St. Augustine

01:25.220 --> 01:27.221
are not gonna be huge sellers.

01:27.222 --> 01:29.790
Too bad it's not celebrity gossip.

01:29.791 --> 01:31.258
Don't go telling your dad

01:31.259 --> 01:33.260
that St. Augustine isn't a celebrity.

01:33.261 --> 01:34.428
That's right.

01:34.429 --> 01:35.997
Jason!

01:35.998 --> 01:37.565
You are gonna miss your ride.

01:37.566 --> 01:38.666
Hey.

01:38.667 --> 01:41.435
Could I get some money for school?

01:41.436 --> 01:42.770
Good morning to you, too.

01:42.771 --> 01:43.971
What do you need?

01:43.972 --> 01:46.374
It's this graphing calculator for Calc.

01:46.375 --> 01:47.808
It's $127.

01:47.809 --> 01:49.944
- What?
- For a calculator?

01:49.945 --> 01:53.781
Can't you just use a pencil and paper?

01:53.782 --> 01:54.982
I could.

01:54.983 --> 01:56.917
I could also just become a blacksmith

01:56.918 --> 01:58.919
and use primitive tools
for an obsolete job

01:58.920 --> 02:00.721
in a world that no longer exists.

02:00.722 --> 02:02.390
- Is this a requirement?
- Yeah.

02:02.391 --> 02:03.524
They're actually $170,

02:03.525 --> 02:05.092
but we get a student
discount at the store.

02:05.093 --> 02:06.794
I know.

02:06.795 --> 02:08.062
Thank you.

02:08.062 --> 02:10.698
Well, for $127,

02:10.699 --> 02:12.199
it'd better guarantee an "A."

02:12.200 --> 02:13.734
Yeah.

02:13.735 --> 02:15.336
That's kind of a big ask

02:15.337 --> 02:18.305
for most public school parents, right?

02:20.609 --> 02:22.843
This arms dealer that we've been after,

02:22.844 --> 02:24.679
Dito Pirosmani?

02:24.680 --> 02:25.946
Spanish law enforcement

02:25.947 --> 02:27.648
was supposed to apprehend him

02:27.649 --> 02:30.017
at his villa. All they
got was a house cat.

02:30.018 --> 02:32.219
Not a good morning for the CIA.

02:32.220 --> 02:36.290
Or me, since I convinced CIA
to let Spain handle the op

02:36.291 --> 02:39.460
instead of our guys.

02:39.461 --> 02:41.729
I'm sorry, you were
saying? The calculator.

02:41.730 --> 02:44.031
You know what? Maybe you could
talk to Jason's math teacher

02:44.032 --> 02:45.199
when you're at the school?

02:45.200 --> 02:47.702
Intelligence work is never done.

02:47.703 --> 02:49.804
Hey, I'm about to read this.

02:49.805 --> 02:50.938
Yeah?

02:50.939 --> 02:52.772
- Yeah. I...
- When?

02:54.809 --> 02:57.016
Our source on Pirosmani's location

02:57.017 --> 02:57.945
was solid, sir.

02:57.946 --> 02:59.146
Then what the hell happened?

02:59.147 --> 03:00.748
It's not hard to believe

03:00.749 --> 03:03.718
he got inside information
from Spanish Intelligence.

03:03.719 --> 03:05.252
Or on our end.

03:05.253 --> 03:07.021
He already had a mole
in the State Department.

03:07.022 --> 03:09.123
So, what's our next move?

03:09.124 --> 03:10.725
We've frozen Pirosmani's assets

03:10.726 --> 03:12.193
in all of our allied nations.

03:12.194 --> 03:13.694
That will limit his movement.

03:13.695 --> 03:15.062
But now that he's
looking over his shoulder,

03:15.063 --> 03:16.897
it'll be that much harder
to capture him alive.

03:16.898 --> 03:18.065
I want this contained.

03:18.066 --> 03:19.400
- Whatever it takes.
- Mr. President,

03:19.401 --> 03:22.036
I do think that we
should make every effort

03:22.037 --> 03:24.572
to take Pirosmani into custody.

03:24.573 --> 03:26.440
Yes, the evidence

03:26.441 --> 03:28.976
that he was behind the
stolen weapons is significant,

03:28.977 --> 03:30.311
but it's still circumstantial.

03:30.312 --> 03:32.480
Alive, we would have the opportunity

03:32.481 --> 03:35.349
to interrogate him and
flush out his whole network

03:35.350 --> 03:37.118
- of illegal arms dealing.
- We have no reason

03:37.119 --> 03:38.385
to believe that he will cooperate

03:38.386 --> 03:40.154
- in an interrogation.
- We also have to consider

03:40.155 --> 03:42.723
the damage to our alliance with Georgia

03:42.724 --> 03:46.627
if we assassinate one of their
citizens extra-judicially.

03:46.628 --> 03:49.063
Though I doubt he's
their favorite citizen.

03:49.064 --> 03:50.197
Mr. President,

03:50.198 --> 03:52.733
if forced to choose
between killing Pirosmani

03:52.734 --> 03:54.201
and allowing him to remain free,

03:54.202 --> 03:55.869
I advise lethal force.

04:05.112 --> 04:07.715
Let's get him alive if we can,

04:07.716 --> 04:11.251
but we'll take him dead
if he leaves us no choice.

04:14.388 --> 04:17.690
Rough night?

04:17.692 --> 04:19.260
Caffeine withdrawal.

04:19.261 --> 04:21.762
Think I'm having a stroke.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.064
Why would you give up on caffeine?

04:24.065 --> 04:25.966
To be healthier, less dependent.

04:25.967 --> 04:28.301
Is that black?

04:32.174 --> 04:33.607
Coming over for the game tonight?

04:33.608 --> 04:34.875
Dude, no offense,

04:34.876 --> 04:36.811
but I can't do another
night at your place.

04:36.812 --> 04:37.912
I mean...

04:37.913 --> 04:39.046
All those metal folding chairs

04:39.047 --> 04:41.482
make me feel like I'm at an AA meeting.

04:41.483 --> 04:43.150
Then sit on the floor.

04:43.151 --> 04:44.685
Okay, what is this?

04:44.686 --> 04:47.521
Are you trying to relive your
first apartment after college?

04:47.522 --> 04:49.824
Because that is not a
year I want to relive.

04:49.825 --> 04:51.692
Mark Meese stole my girlfriend

04:51.693 --> 04:53.427
and ate all my cereal.

04:53.428 --> 04:56.897
And the furniture was terrible.

04:56.898 --> 04:58.299
I'm just keeping it simple.

04:58.300 --> 05:01.135
That's what guys say when
they don't want to commit.

05:01.136 --> 05:02.636
But, you see...

05:02.637 --> 05:04.905
you need to commit to your life.

05:04.906 --> 05:06.407
Because your life

05:06.408 --> 05:10.477
is not a girl you met
at Burning Man, man.

05:10.478 --> 05:12.847
You're better with caffeine.

05:12.848 --> 05:14.248
I know.

05:14.249 --> 05:16.183
- Damn it.
- Hey.

05:16.184 --> 05:19.320
Call me when you have an ottoman.

05:19.321 --> 05:22.022
This is it. Everything
we've got on Pirosmani.

05:22.023 --> 05:23.190
From the Western allies.

05:23.191 --> 05:25.559
I can go back to CIA.

05:25.560 --> 05:27.695
I don't know. I...

05:27.696 --> 05:30.097
It feels like we're
looking for a puzzle piece

05:30.098 --> 05:31.765
that just isn't there.

05:31.766 --> 05:34.068
He said he doesn't deal
in stolen U.S. weapons,

05:34.069 --> 05:35.803
and now all the best Intel

05:35.804 --> 05:38.505
in the world says the same thing.

05:38.506 --> 05:40.274
On the other hand, he is an arms dealer.

05:40.275 --> 05:42.176
Who kept his word in Somalia.

05:42.177 --> 05:43.244
I thought

05:43.245 --> 05:44.612
I had a good read on him.

05:44.613 --> 05:46.046
CIA's Russian file did say

05:46.047 --> 05:47.248
they had a forensic accountant

05:47.249 --> 05:49.884
in GRU tracking him over
the last eight years.

05:49.885 --> 05:53.287
Well, I'm sure the
Kremlin isn't in a hurry

05:53.288 --> 05:55.756
to expose their lax weapons control

05:55.757 --> 05:57.491
- and corruption.
- That's what I thought.

05:57.492 --> 05:58.893
So I looked up the accountant.

05:58.894 --> 06:00.661
He's due to attend an
international conference

06:00.662 --> 06:02.763
on information systems over
the next few days in Nice.

06:02.764 --> 06:04.398
One of us could reach out.

06:04.399 --> 06:05.898
See if he'd meet.

06:08.302 --> 06:12.973
That would be going
around CIA's investigation.

06:12.974 --> 06:15.809
It's a fact-finding mission.

06:15.810 --> 06:17.810
Following up on Somalia.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.381
Call him.

06:20.382 --> 06:23.951
He agrees to take the meeting, you go.

06:23.952 --> 06:25.152
Just me?

06:25.153 --> 06:27.221
Take a few extra days on the Riviera.

06:27.222 --> 06:29.390
You've been through it
lately. You could use a break.

06:29.391 --> 06:32.326
Like the sound of that.

06:32.327 --> 06:34.995
So, where are we with the VFF
since they landed in Greece?

06:34.996 --> 06:38.032
Sir, based on Dr. McCord's theory

06:38.033 --> 06:39.466
that they're following.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.402
Biblical prophecy,

06:41.403 --> 06:43.437
we're focusing on the Middle East,

06:43.438 --> 06:45.205
but we don't want to rule out

06:45.206 --> 06:47.207
- a European attack.
- Not much of a focus.

06:47.208 --> 06:48.342
No leads?

06:48.343 --> 06:50.244
We have every available sigint system

06:50.245 --> 06:52.079
tracking Slattery, Abbott and Zanner,

06:52.080 --> 06:54.815
but so far no hits with
facial or voice recognition.

06:54.816 --> 06:56.550
Either they're still in transit

06:56.551 --> 06:57.985
or they slipped past border control.

06:57.986 --> 06:59.219
This isn't gonna work.

06:59.220 --> 07:01.088
It's too much territory.

07:01.089 --> 07:03.090
We need another approach.

07:03.091 --> 07:05.059
Sir, we can go with Henry's theory

07:05.060 --> 07:08.696
and just put all of
our chips on Jerusalem.

07:08.697 --> 07:11.498
The Lailat Al Mi'raj celebration
at the Al-Aqsa Mosque.

07:11.499 --> 07:13.534
It's a likely target if
you want to provoke conflict

07:13.535 --> 07:16.437
between Israel and Sunni Islam,
but it's not the only one.

07:16.438 --> 07:19.106
There's Al Kaaba at
Al-Masjid Al-Haram in Mecca,

07:19.107 --> 07:22.309
there's Al-Masjid
an-Nabawi in Medina...

07:22.310 --> 07:23.677
But you said Al-Aqsa

07:23.678 --> 07:25.412
is the most likely target?

07:25.413 --> 07:27.815
If I'm right and they want to provoke

07:27.816 --> 07:29.550
worldwide conflict, the crossroads

07:29.551 --> 07:32.920
of Judaism, Islam and Christianity

07:32.921 --> 07:34.987
is a likely place to start.

07:37.324 --> 07:39.944
Let's tighten our focus to Israel

07:39.945 --> 07:42.680
and its border countries.
Give 'em 48 hours.

07:42.681 --> 07:43.781
See what we get.

07:43.782 --> 07:46.317
And if we're wrong and they decide

07:46.318 --> 07:49.053
to hit Rome, Paris or Istanbul?

07:49.054 --> 07:50.753
Then we made the wrong choice.

07:55.926 --> 07:58.496
Mr. Soroka?

07:58.497 --> 08:00.364
Mr. Whitman. Nice to see you.

08:00.365 --> 08:02.233
- Please.
- Thanks for meeting me.

08:02.234 --> 08:03.092
Sure.

08:03.093 --> 08:05.569
It's a little bit
colder than I expected.

08:05.570 --> 08:06.737
It's windy?

08:06.738 --> 08:08.272
Yeah.

08:08.273 --> 08:09.940
Garçon?

08:09.941 --> 08:11.242
Un autre café, s'il vous plaît.

08:11.243 --> 08:12.209
Oui, Monsieur.

08:12.210 --> 08:15.212
Merci. So, enjoying the Riviera?

08:15.213 --> 08:17.381
You know, these conferences.

08:17.382 --> 08:19.984
It's barely time to enjoy it.

08:19.985 --> 08:21.218
You must forgive me.

08:21.219 --> 08:23.254
I-I might be, called away.

08:23.255 --> 08:24.889
- Of course. And I can make this quick.
- Yes.

08:24.890 --> 08:26.023
I mentioned that we're

08:26.024 --> 08:28.659
looking into Dito Pirosmani.

08:28.660 --> 08:30.461
Really we just need to locate him.

08:30.462 --> 08:31.996
We're hoping to intervene in a hotspot

08:31.997 --> 08:34.131
in East Timor, and we understand

08:34.131 --> 08:37.835
that Dito has some,
business dealings in the region.

08:37.836 --> 08:41.337
Yeah, I suppose you don't
mean his chemical company.

08:41.339 --> 08:42.840
Not in this case, no.

08:42.841 --> 08:45.476
And I suppose that's not why
you're tracking his accounts.

08:45.477 --> 08:48.946
Mr. Whitman, your secretary of state

08:48.947 --> 08:51.982
is a, a bold woman,

08:51.983 --> 08:54.318
but she should be careful
who she works with.

08:54.319 --> 08:56.053
We're moving carefully.

08:56.054 --> 08:58.522
That's why I came to you.

08:58.523 --> 09:01.724
Yes, yes...

09:03.828 --> 09:05.429
Sorry, I-I need to take this.

09:05.430 --> 09:07.398
- Of course.
- Yes.

09:07.399 --> 09:08.666
Hello.

09:08.667 --> 09:11.734
Da.

09:12.403 --> 09:14.305
- Hey.
- No noise.

09:14.306 --> 09:16.106
Wh-Whoa. Come on.

09:16.107 --> 09:18.042
Help! Help!

09:18.043 --> 09:21.544
Help!

09:40.268 --> 09:41.868
I still think

09:41.869 --> 09:45.338
I should do the whole thing in Dutch.

09:45.339 --> 09:48.675
Well, the Koningsdag address
is customarily given in English,

09:48.676 --> 09:51.114
but, then again, we've
never done it online before.

09:51.115 --> 09:54.151
- So...
- Let's have Matt translate his remarks.

09:54.152 --> 09:55.852
Ma'am. Jay is on line two.

09:55.853 --> 09:57.688
I... And here.

09:57.689 --> 09:59.089
Will you have Matt
translate this, please?

09:59.090 --> 10:00.457
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

10:00.458 --> 10:01.658
We're live in six minutes.

10:01.659 --> 10:03.293
Yeah.

10:03.294 --> 10:06.096
Please tell me you
are nursing a sunburn.

10:06.097 --> 10:07.964
Not at the moment, ma'am, no.

10:07.965 --> 10:09.666
There's a bit of a problem.

10:09.667 --> 10:11.467
What? How?

10:12.269 --> 10:16.138
You should never have betrayed me.

10:17.541 --> 10:18.942
Who is this?

10:18.943 --> 10:20.811
I was your friend.

10:20.812 --> 10:22.946
Now I am your enemy.

10:22.947 --> 10:24.648
Dito, what's this about?

10:24.649 --> 10:26.917
You have till end of business tomorrow

10:26.918 --> 10:28.584
to release my assets.

10:29.619 --> 10:31.455
End of business where?

10:31.456 --> 10:32.556
And where are you?

10:32.557 --> 10:33.724
You froze my accounts.

10:33.725 --> 10:35.692
You know where they are.

10:35.693 --> 10:37.994
Good-bye, Madam Secretary.

10:46.670 --> 10:47.650
Pirosmani has to know

10:47.651 --> 10:50.342
that the United States doesn't
negotiate with terrorists.

10:50.343 --> 10:53.478
He doesn't consider himself a terrorist.

10:53.479 --> 10:56.615
He considers himself a businessman.

10:56.616 --> 10:59.718
At the very least, he'll
insist we return his assets.

10:59.719 --> 11:01.419
Will we?

11:01.420 --> 11:03.020
No.

11:04.689 --> 11:05.957
I'll have more information

11:05.958 --> 11:07.559
for you after I meet with the president.

11:07.560 --> 11:09.927
We have to tell his family.

11:10.662 --> 11:12.664
Yeah, of course.

11:12.665 --> 11:14.566
I'll call Abby.

11:14.567 --> 11:16.101
I know it goes without saying,

11:16.102 --> 11:18.670
but we need to keep a
tight circle on this.

11:18.671 --> 11:21.205
For Jay's sake.

11:23.175 --> 11:24.643
I'm sorry. When exactly

11:24.644 --> 11:26.077
did the State Department
decide to intervene

11:26.078 --> 11:27.206
in an ongoing CIA investigation?

11:27.207 --> 11:29.581
This wasn't some kind
of covert operation.

11:29.582 --> 11:32.584
It was one bureaucrat seeking
information from another.

11:32.585 --> 11:34.819
And in so doing, you
put your policy advisor

11:34.820 --> 11:36.888
in a life-and-death situation
that he isn't trained to handle!

11:36.889 --> 11:38.355
Enough!

11:40.358 --> 11:44.062
Pirosmani has kidnapped
an American diplomat.

11:44.063 --> 11:46.360
This is a CIA matter now.

11:46.361 --> 11:48.166
Exactly who knew Jay's itinerary?

11:48.167 --> 11:51.970
Only the accountant, Timur Soroka.

11:51.971 --> 11:53.203
We'll find him.

11:53.972 --> 11:56.208
Just so this is perfectly clear,

11:56.209 --> 11:59.077
the United States will
not compromise its policy

11:59.078 --> 12:00.782
against negotiating with terrorists.

12:00.783 --> 12:02.446
Of course.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.690
Yes, I really appreciate it.

12:11.691 --> 12:13.725
Thank you.

12:13.726 --> 12:14.726
Ms. Alvarez?

12:14.727 --> 12:16.661
Hey. Jason's dad.

12:16.662 --> 12:18.630
- Hi. Henry McCord.
- Of course.

12:18.631 --> 12:21.066
You're working the
book fair with crutches.

12:21.067 --> 12:22.400
That's amazing.

12:22.401 --> 12:24.636
Yeah, well, I kind of feel like
I'm working in the last days

12:24.637 --> 12:27.038
of the whaling industry,
but I'm doing what I can.

12:27.039 --> 12:29.074
Listen, Jason came to me

12:29.075 --> 12:32.978
about this graphing calculator
he needs, and, I mean,

12:32.979 --> 12:35.213
it's not a hardship for
us, but I got to believe

12:35.214 --> 12:37.082
that if we have to have a book fair

12:37.083 --> 12:38.717
to send the debate team to New York,

12:38.718 --> 12:40.518
then there's got to be a lot
of families that can't afford

12:40.519 --> 12:41.886
to throw money at a piece of gear

12:41.887 --> 12:43.154
that they're not gonna use in a year.

12:43.155 --> 12:45.924
I get it. I wanted to
subsidize them altogether,

12:45.925 --> 12:48.493
but we did get as deep
a discount as we could.

12:48.494 --> 12:50.629
Can we go to the company?
We got to do better

12:50.630 --> 12:52.931
- than 127 bucks.
- No.

12:52.932 --> 12:55.766
It's just $27.

12:58.837 --> 13:01.072
You must have misread
the notice we sent home.

13:01.073 --> 13:03.275
Well, there you go. Problem solved.

13:04.510 --> 13:06.311
Numbers. They will get you every time.

13:06.312 --> 13:08.779
- Sorry to bother you.
- No bother.

13:11.850 --> 13:14.486
Mr. Brennan, thanks for agreeing
to see me on such short notice.

13:14.487 --> 13:16.321
I think it's Daryl by now.

13:16.322 --> 13:19.157
How's your colleague in
Somalia? Anis, was it?

13:19.158 --> 13:21.192
Yeah. He's still recovering,

13:21.193 --> 13:24.029
but I'm-I'm sure he'll be
back in action soon enough.

13:24.030 --> 13:25.964
You'll have to excuse me.

13:25.965 --> 13:27.632
I-I need to cut to the chase.

13:27.633 --> 13:29.601
Yeah, go.

13:29.602 --> 13:32.671
What's your impression
of Dito Pirosmani?

13:32.672 --> 13:35.774
I only know him by reputation,
never worked with him.

13:35.775 --> 13:38.476
I'm asking you to be frank.

13:38.477 --> 13:41.313
Can I trust Dito Pirosmani

13:41.314 --> 13:43.814
in a one-on-one negotiation?

13:46.951 --> 13:49.754
Early... I'm talking before Fallujah...

13:49.755 --> 13:52.691
we were sent to train a
core group of local militia

13:52.692 --> 13:55.760
on a training site 60
klicks outside of Basra.

13:55.761 --> 13:57.796
We were short on carriers,

13:57.797 --> 14:00.365
so I made a deal with the
only supplier available.

14:00.366 --> 14:01.182
Pirosmani.

14:01.183 --> 14:03.535
I paid him a good price,
but my guy tells me

14:03.536 --> 14:05.470
he can't get it through.

14:05.471 --> 14:08.673
At the same time, we
get Intel we'd been made.

14:08.674 --> 14:12.777
400 or 500 Iraqi insurgents
only half a day out.

14:12.778 --> 14:14.779
I get Dito on the sat,

14:14.780 --> 14:16.781
explain the transfer problem,

14:16.782 --> 14:18.817
tell him I will personally
guarantee the funds,

14:18.818 --> 14:21.219
but we need the trucks
to evac immediately.

14:21.220 --> 14:23.655
His answer?

14:23.656 --> 14:26.423
"Not my problem."

14:27.625 --> 14:29.461
We lost half the contingent

14:29.462 --> 14:32.364
of the best officers Iraq had to
offer in a three-hour firefight.

14:32.365 --> 14:36.066
Pirosmani all but murdered them himself.

14:39.070 --> 14:41.106
Merci. Je t'envoie un numéro à utiliser

14:41.107 --> 14:43.674
pour une transmission sécurisée.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.611
What are you guys still doing here?

14:46.612 --> 14:48.146
No one wanted to leave.

14:48.147 --> 14:50.482
There's, um, Kung Pao
chicken if you want.

14:50.483 --> 14:51.850
No, thanks...

14:51.851 --> 14:53.184
What's the news from Intelligence?

14:53.185 --> 14:58.623
They got into the hotel
security cameras, but nothing.

14:58.624 --> 15:00.325
Okay, well, why don't you all head home,

15:00.326 --> 15:02.026
and we'll let you know
if there's any news?

15:02.027 --> 15:04.361
No.

15:05.163 --> 15:07.999
Well, then, Blake,
how about some coffee?

15:08.000 --> 15:09.011
God, yes, please.

15:09.012 --> 15:12.169
- Yes, and also Henry left word for you.
- Great.

15:16.674 --> 15:18.543
My number one rule is never work

15:18.544 --> 15:20.044
with the American government.

15:20.045 --> 15:21.346
They always screw you.

15:24.750 --> 15:27.752
I'm trying not to feel like it's a wake.

15:27.753 --> 15:28.953
Let's call it a vigil.

15:28.954 --> 15:30.388
You got a lot of good people

15:30.389 --> 15:31.956
working really hard to get him home.

15:31.957 --> 15:34.192
How's your work going?

15:34.193 --> 15:36.261
Don't ask if you want a distraction.

15:36.262 --> 15:38.596
That bad?

15:38.597 --> 15:40.231
I hope not.

15:40.232 --> 15:41.833
If it all goes to hell, it's on me.

15:41.834 --> 15:44.169
We are really...

15:44.170 --> 15:47.238
not helping each other
right now, are we?

15:47.239 --> 15:49.706
Okay, you want a distraction?

15:51.443 --> 15:55.880
You know that $127 solid-gold
calculator Jason needs?

15:55.881 --> 15:57.882
Yeah.

15:57.883 --> 15:59.884
The one with the diamond buttons?

15:59.885 --> 16:01.920
I ran into his math teacher.

16:01.921 --> 16:04.289
It's a $27 calculator.

16:04.290 --> 16:05.924
Jason padded the number.

16:05.925 --> 16:07.358
Why would he do that?

16:07.359 --> 16:10.161
I'm trying not to think the worst.

16:10.162 --> 16:11.863
You haven't asked him yet?

16:11.864 --> 16:13.698
No, I'm waiting for the right time.

16:13.699 --> 16:15.333
Th-There's something going on with him.

16:15.334 --> 16:16.801
He's just been so down lately.

16:16.802 --> 16:18.036
Well,

16:18.037 --> 16:20.839
find out what's going
on, and then nail him.

16:20.840 --> 16:22.941
Due process.

16:22.942 --> 16:25.142
Yeah.

16:26.878 --> 16:30.348
What if I really messed up?

16:30.349 --> 16:32.951
Babe, you sent Jay on
a diplomatic mission.

16:32.952 --> 16:35.887
There's no way you could
have known this would happen.

16:35.888 --> 16:37.121
I undermined the CIA.

16:37.122 --> 16:39.457
I thought I had a hunch about this guy,

16:39.458 --> 16:41.292
and I put Jay in harm's way.

16:41.293 --> 16:42.627
Don't do this to yourself.

16:42.628 --> 16:45.296
But I did do this.

16:45.297 --> 16:47.398
And I did it to Abby

16:47.399 --> 16:48.633
and his daughter.

16:48.634 --> 16:49.801
Babe...

16:49.802 --> 16:52.069
I have to get him home.

16:58.776 --> 17:02.606
- You're up early.
- Yeah, there's a debate meeting.

17:02.607 --> 17:05.142
- I'm-I'm taking the bus.
- You're gonna miss it.

17:05.143 --> 17:08.243
I ran into your calculus teacher.

17:11.048 --> 17:13.183
Do I need to go on?

17:13.184 --> 17:15.752
You know what?

17:15.752 --> 17:18.255
Just... just ground me,

17:18.256 --> 17:20.022
and I'll-I'll give you
the money back. It's fine.

17:20.023 --> 17:21.625
You're not getting off that easy.

17:21.626 --> 17:24.094
You have one chance to explain to me

17:24.095 --> 17:26.230
what is worth more
to you than our trust.

17:32.170 --> 17:34.204
Okay, look, if you're in trouble...

17:34.205 --> 17:36.507
- drugs, whatever...
- No.

17:36.508 --> 17:39.976
No, it's noth... It's-it's
nothing like that.

17:43.548 --> 17:47.317
There's this guy, Siham, at Westmore.

17:47.318 --> 17:51.020
He's some kind of Kuwaiti prince.

17:52.589 --> 17:54.658
And he's-he's always driving
around in his Bugatti,

17:54.659 --> 17:57.661
and taking everyone to these
private clubs in New York,

17:57.662 --> 18:01.798
and it's just this... disgusting
display of materialism.

18:01.799 --> 18:03.567
And, you know, Piper and I...

18:03.568 --> 18:05.836
we're always making
fun of this guy, right?

18:05.837 --> 18:08.438
And then, last week,
I go on his Instagram,

18:08.439 --> 18:10.407
so we'll have new stuff to laugh about,

18:10.408 --> 18:12.576
and there he is on a helicopter ride.

18:12.577 --> 18:14.144
With Piper.

18:14.145 --> 18:16.046
Buddy.

18:16.047 --> 18:20.150
It was like she got
kidnapped by the pod people.

18:20.151 --> 18:22.885
I'm still waiting to
hear about the money.

18:25.889 --> 18:27.958
There's a hot air balloon you can rent.

18:27.959 --> 18:30.327
- Buddy!
- I know! I know.

18:30.328 --> 18:32.829
It's $340 for two hours,

18:32.830 --> 18:34.765
and I just thought...

18:34.766 --> 18:36.934
if I could get her in the air somehow...

18:36.935 --> 18:39.636
Okay, I got to say something.
Two things, actually.

18:39.637 --> 18:42.439
One... we're never gonna be able
to compete with Kuwaiti royalty.

18:42.440 --> 18:43.974
I know.

18:43.975 --> 18:47.511
And two, which is way more important.

18:47.512 --> 18:50.280
Piper's gonna like who she likes,

18:50.281 --> 18:52.282
and it might not make
sense, and it might seem like

18:52.283 --> 18:54.084
she's betraying who she really is,

18:54.085 --> 18:56.987
but you're not gonna change her mind

18:56.988 --> 18:59.288
by trying to compete.

19:10.167 --> 19:11.702
Ma'am?

19:11.703 --> 19:13.670
What's wrong? You got any news?

19:13.671 --> 19:17.441
French Intelligence has
Timur Soroka in custody.

19:17.442 --> 19:19.242
Okay, that's good.

19:19.243 --> 19:21.678
Um, is he talking yet?

19:21.679 --> 19:24.081
He's asking for a lawyer.

19:24.082 --> 19:28.151
And, Jay's wife is here.

19:28.152 --> 19:31.688
Okay, um, let me...

19:31.689 --> 19:34.758
Let me see what I can
get out of Soroka first

19:34.759 --> 19:36.460
before I talk to Abby.

19:36.461 --> 19:38.228
Can you...?

19:38.229 --> 19:40.530
Of course.

19:40.531 --> 19:43.734
I met with Jay Whitman.

19:43.735 --> 19:45.936
We had coffee.

19:45.937 --> 19:48.805
I stepped away to make a phone call.

19:48.806 --> 19:50.707
He was gone. That's it.

19:50.708 --> 19:52.409
That's all I know.

19:52.410 --> 19:53.877
Can I go home now?

20:00.684 --> 20:04.988
Tell Mr. Soroka his private
account in Cape Verde, where

20:04.989 --> 20:06.757
we know Dito Pirosmani does business...

20:06.758 --> 20:08.191
that was our first clue.

20:08.192 --> 20:11.128
Would he like to hear a list
of the payments he's received

20:11.129 --> 20:13.130
over the last 18 months?

20:17.634 --> 20:19.736
Your boss say to me,

20:19.737 --> 20:22.673
"Help save starving Africans."

20:22.674 --> 20:24.274
I'm undone by my own heart!

20:24.275 --> 20:27.144
Mr. Pirosmani, my
boss did not screw you.

20:27.145 --> 20:30.080
No? I help her, she takes my money

20:30.081 --> 20:31.515
and hunts me like an animal.

20:31.516 --> 20:34.785
'Cause you put stolen M16 rifles
in the hands of terrorists.

20:34.786 --> 20:36.486
You know we can't just overlook that.

20:36.487 --> 20:37.788
What are you saying?

20:37.789 --> 20:39.289
I never touch American guns.

20:39.290 --> 20:41.024
- What?
- The M16s.

20:41.025 --> 20:42.793
They jam in combat.

20:42.794 --> 20:45.262
They don't like heat, they
don't like sand, they...

20:45.263 --> 20:47.064
You know what everyone wants?

20:47.065 --> 20:50.200
The guerillas, the
insurgents, even your own army.

20:50.201 --> 20:53.603
They want...

20:53.604 --> 20:55.639
Kalashnikov.

20:55.640 --> 20:58.375
It's like a Niva. It's
ugly, but you get there.

20:58.376 --> 21:01.445
Why do I want American
guns that nobody else wants?

21:01.446 --> 21:03.146
I never screw you.

21:03.147 --> 21:04.680
Why you screw me?

21:13.857 --> 21:16.693
This little two-bit bureaucrat
thinks he can play games.

21:16.694 --> 21:19.329
Tell him we're contacting.

21:19.330 --> 21:20.397
President Salnikov.

21:21.599 --> 21:24.034
I'm sure he'd be interested to know

21:24.035 --> 21:26.536
that one of his top forensic accountants

21:26.537 --> 21:29.406
is in the pocket of
a Georgian arms dealer

21:29.407 --> 21:31.908
trafficking in stolen
U.S. military weapons.

21:40.250 --> 21:43.353
Enjoy Gldani prison.

21:59.636 --> 22:02.806
Fine. Let's see it.

22:02.807 --> 22:04.341
I don't understand.

22:04.342 --> 22:06.977
The secretary called me yesterday.

22:06.978 --> 22:09.411
How can you not know where he is?

22:10.614 --> 22:13.350
He is the number one priority right now

22:13.351 --> 22:16.286
for several intelligence agencies.

22:16.287 --> 22:18.088
They'll find him.

22:18.089 --> 22:19.956
What if something goes wrong?

22:19.957 --> 22:21.958
- What if they don't find him? What...?
- Abby.

22:21.959 --> 22:24.961
I have seen many

22:24.962 --> 22:27.731
hostage situations resolved.

22:27.732 --> 22:31.134
We have extremely skilled negotiators.

22:31.135 --> 22:33.103
But I know you won't pay ransom.

22:33.104 --> 22:35.071
So what is there to negotiate?

22:35.072 --> 22:37.573
It's always about more than money.

22:41.045 --> 22:43.513
I know this is a lot to handle.

22:43.514 --> 22:45.915
Do you have someone at home?

22:51.087 --> 22:53.156
You sure you don't need a ride?

22:53.157 --> 22:55.525
No. My mom's coming, but thanks.

22:55.526 --> 22:56.493
Yeah.

22:56.494 --> 22:58.794
Hey.

23:00.163 --> 23:04.366
I know what you probably
think of me, but...

23:05.068 --> 23:07.370
I really do love him, you know?

23:07.371 --> 23:10.639
Of course you do.

23:12.642 --> 23:16.545
But what if Jay doesn't know that?

23:35.532 --> 23:37.801
Where are we?

23:37.802 --> 23:40.036
We have five heat signatures.

23:40.037 --> 23:42.172
Three on the first floor,
two in the basement.

23:42.173 --> 23:43.673
And we've confirmed Jay Whitman

23:43.674 --> 23:45.075
and Dito Pirosmani are among them?

23:45.076 --> 23:46.309
Yeah, we received corroborating Intel

23:46.310 --> 23:48.111
from DGSI five minutes ago.

23:48.112 --> 23:50.280
Now, we have to assume that
Whitman's in the basement.

23:50.281 --> 23:51.446
Is there any direct access?

23:51.447 --> 23:52.849
Negative. They'll have
to go through the bogeys

23:52.850 --> 23:54.517
on the first floor,
then down the stairs.

23:54.518 --> 23:56.152
That leaves whoever's guarding Whitman

23:56.153 --> 23:57.654
plenty of time to take him out.

23:57.655 --> 23:58.822
That's a risk we may have to take.

23:58.823 --> 24:00.160
Dito Pirosmani

24:00.161 --> 24:01.992
didn't steal our weapons.

24:01.993 --> 24:04.628
He can't be responsible
for Garcia or Milken.

24:04.629 --> 24:05.435
What's this?

24:05.436 --> 24:08.565
Analysis of Soroka's
dossier on Pirosmani.

24:08.566 --> 24:10.074
The accountant who
was cooking the books?

24:10.075 --> 24:11.275
One set was cooked.

24:11.276 --> 24:13.578
Pirosmani paid Soroka to doctor them

24:13.579 --> 24:16.180
to keep him out of
trouble with the Russians.

24:16.181 --> 24:17.815
This is the second set.

24:17.816 --> 24:21.152
So he'd have leverage in
case Pirosmani turned on him.

24:21.153 --> 24:24.322
Mr. President, we have no
time to corroborate this.

24:24.323 --> 24:25.890
No. I've been through it.

24:25.891 --> 24:27.158
There is not

24:27.159 --> 24:30.227
one single deal on American soil

24:30.228 --> 24:32.930
or involving American arms.

24:32.931 --> 24:35.484
He's not our guy, sir.

24:35.485 --> 24:37.168
He's holding an American
diplomat hostage,

24:37.169 --> 24:38.502
so now he is our guy.

24:38.503 --> 24:40.504
He already thought we were after him,

24:40.505 --> 24:43.274
then freezing his assets
just confirmed his paranoia.

24:43.275 --> 24:45.142
He played fair with us, we screwed him.

24:45.143 --> 24:46.577
At least that's how he sees it.

24:46.578 --> 24:49.046
We have 47 minutes before
Pirosmani's deadline

24:49.047 --> 24:50.581
to save your staffer.

24:50.582 --> 24:52.083
Mr. President, there's no time.

24:52.084 --> 24:54.385
We all know that we go
in there guns blazing,

24:54.386 --> 24:57.822
we put Jay and those
SEALs at tremendous risk.

24:57.823 --> 24:59.490
What are you asking for?

24:59.491 --> 25:02.760
Enough time to make sure
that this is our only option.

25:02.761 --> 25:04.295
If I'm right,

25:04.296 --> 25:05.796
Pirosmani's on the defensive.

25:05.797 --> 25:07.765
He doesn't want to kill

25:07.766 --> 25:10.301
an American FSO, he just
wants his empire back.

25:10.302 --> 25:12.637
We give him another chance

25:12.638 --> 25:16.507
to reach out to us one more time,

25:16.508 --> 25:18.433
and save us having to go in.

25:18.434 --> 25:20.578
That's a pretty big
gamble with your own guy.

25:20.579 --> 25:24.647
Which should tell you how
confident I am in this evidence.

25:27.418 --> 25:28.386
40 minutes on the clock.

25:28.387 --> 25:30.888
Then we go in.

25:30.889 --> 25:33.424
Stand by, Neptune, await my order.

25:33.425 --> 25:36.027
Now, what do you see here?

25:36.028 --> 25:39.363
I-I don't know.

25:39.364 --> 25:41.298
A-A-A bank account?

25:41.299 --> 25:43.734
Yeah. That's my primary
account in Zurich.

25:43.735 --> 25:46.370
And it's still empty.

25:46.371 --> 25:49.005
I told you they won't pay for me.

25:52.810 --> 25:54.979
But I am not a terrorist.

25:54.980 --> 25:56.280
It's my own money!

25:56.281 --> 25:58.649
But you are a kidnapper now.

25:58.650 --> 26:01.085
And the president of the United States

26:01.086 --> 26:03.254
is not gonna reverse his
position of non-negotiation

26:03.255 --> 26:05.089
just to preserve my life.

26:05.090 --> 26:08.025
I'm not that important.

26:08.026 --> 26:11.394
Then they leave me no choice.

26:17.868 --> 26:21.238
You might get out of this,
but you'll never be free again.

26:21.239 --> 26:24.341
For the rest of your life you'll
be looking over your shoulder.

26:24.342 --> 26:27.911
And eventually, they will find you.

26:29.280 --> 26:30.848
If you really want out of this,

26:30.849 --> 26:32.950
you've got one chance.

26:32.951 --> 26:36.987
If those M16s weren't yours,
then someone set you up.

26:36.988 --> 26:41.092
And if that's true, you have
to talk to the secretary.

26:41.093 --> 26:42.493
She already betrayed me.

26:42.494 --> 26:44.295
Listen to me. If you're
telling the truth,

26:44.296 --> 26:46.864
then kidnapping me, that
was your only offense

26:46.865 --> 26:48.466
against the United States.

26:48.467 --> 26:49.667
And I-I-I might,

26:49.668 --> 26:50.801
I might be worth enough

26:50.802 --> 26:53.571
to get you off the hook for that.

26:53.572 --> 26:55.272
Yeah.

26:55.273 --> 26:57.208
You have a gun to your head,

26:57.209 --> 27:00.610
so you will say anything to survive.

27:01.812 --> 27:04.148
Mr. President.

27:04.149 --> 27:06.851
Dito Pirosmani is calling
for Secretary McCord.

27:06.852 --> 27:08.985
Mr. President.

27:10.521 --> 27:14.859
Yes. You have my permission
to offer him his freedom.

27:14.860 --> 27:16.960
Put him through, Lieutenant.

27:21.432 --> 27:22.933
This is Secretary McCord.

27:22.934 --> 27:26.337
Mr. Pirosmani, before we continue,

27:26.338 --> 27:28.439
I need proof that Jay Whitman is alive.

27:28.440 --> 27:31.175
She wants to hear you.

27:31.176 --> 27:34.111
I'm here, ma'am.

27:35.647 --> 27:37.114
Dito, let me be clear.

27:37.115 --> 27:39.183
This is not a negotiation.

27:39.184 --> 27:41.185
Then I waste my time.

27:41.186 --> 27:43.020
You have an American hostage.

27:43.021 --> 27:44.455
There are consequences to that.

27:44.456 --> 27:46.423
We cannot unfreeze your assets.

27:46.424 --> 27:48.926
But you took my money for
something that I didn't do.

27:48.927 --> 27:50.795
Based on your known criminal history

27:50.796 --> 27:53.230
and a great deal of
evidence, yes; However,

27:53.231 --> 27:56.300
we have new evidence that seems to show

27:56.301 --> 27:58.135
that you did not steal
U.S. military weapons.

27:58.136 --> 27:59.470
As I said.

27:59.471 --> 28:00.671
So let me go.

28:00.672 --> 28:03.707
If you surrender your
hostage immediately,

28:03.708 --> 28:06.343
I can see that you leave with
your freedom, but that's all.

28:06.344 --> 28:10.047
So you call to say me
that you made a mistake,

28:10.048 --> 28:12.316
and you still take my money?

28:12.317 --> 28:14.185
It's after what I have done for you?

28:14.186 --> 28:17.221
Release Jay Whitman and
you leave with your life.

28:17.222 --> 28:18.722
So you're ready to risk

28:18.723 --> 28:20.691
killing your own man to get me,

28:20.692 --> 28:22.560
knowing that you are wrong?

28:22.561 --> 28:26.163
Unfortunately, that is a risk

28:26.164 --> 28:27.598
we are willing to take, yes.

28:27.599 --> 28:29.834
We all have to live with risks we take.

28:29.835 --> 28:31.701
Good-bye, Madam Secretary.

28:41.581 --> 28:44.617
Two minutes out. Neptune,
move to position one.

28:48.221 --> 28:50.090
We've got to go.

28:50.091 --> 28:51.792
Wait, this doesn't make sense.

28:51.793 --> 28:54.194
I mean, why is he doing this to himself?

28:54.195 --> 28:56.495
Sir.

28:58.665 --> 29:01.768
On the ground now!

29:01.769 --> 29:04.136
Stay down, stay down.

29:06.139 --> 29:08.274
Okay, we got you.

29:09.506 --> 29:11.739
We have the package.

29:13.008 --> 29:15.177
Package secured.

29:15.178 --> 29:16.107
Team retreat.

29:16.108 --> 29:18.080
Hold, please, Admiral.

29:18.081 --> 29:19.548
Team leaders, stand by.

29:19.549 --> 29:20.997
We should take him.

29:20.998 --> 29:23.800
No. That wasn't the deal.

29:23.801 --> 29:25.946
Someone puts a gun to your
head, that's not a deal.

29:25.947 --> 29:26.915
He's worthless

29:26.916 --> 29:28.616
as an asset.

29:28.617 --> 29:30.018
He has no cash,

29:30.019 --> 29:32.587
the entire international
community is after him.

29:32.588 --> 29:35.523
I mean, why, why would
we risk those men's lives

29:35.524 --> 29:38.126
to go after a man who's
no longer a threat?

29:38.127 --> 29:40.261
I have to agree with the secretary.

29:40.262 --> 29:41.930
Stand down.

29:41.931 --> 29:43.731
RTB, Neptune. Over.

29:43.732 --> 29:47.567
Copy. Over and out.

29:50.772 --> 29:53.408
Now that we've got out
of that little folly,

29:53.409 --> 29:56.109
I'd like to know who we
should have been after.

29:59.847 --> 30:02.350
He conned us out of a hundred bucks

30:02.351 --> 30:04.185
for a hot air balloon?

30:04.186 --> 30:05.453
Can you think of a good reason?

30:05.454 --> 30:07.722
So where'd you land?
Good cop or bad cop?

30:07.723 --> 30:09.724
Grounded for lying,
pancakes for broken heart.

30:09.725 --> 30:11.025
You know, I got to say,

30:11.026 --> 30:13.027
- I'm surprised at Piper.
- Right?

30:13.028 --> 30:15.363
She doesn't seem like
a "Barbie's Dreamliner"

30:15.364 --> 30:17.031
- kind of girl.
- But you know what?

30:17.032 --> 30:19.901
This is good; She's going
against her instincts.

30:19.902 --> 30:22.870
Jason's got to get in there
and build on the friendship.

30:22.871 --> 30:24.138
That's not exactly what I told him.

30:24.139 --> 30:25.206
You didn't tell him

30:25.207 --> 30:26.741
- to fight for her?
- Well, he did.

30:26.742 --> 30:27.742
Look where that led him.

30:27.743 --> 30:29.410
Because he went too big. Henry.

30:29.411 --> 30:32.213
Your son needs you, come on.

30:32.214 --> 30:34.182
Okay, okay, okay. Have
you got leftover energy

30:34.183 --> 30:36.250
from hostage negotiation, or what?

30:36.251 --> 30:37.952
Definitely not.

30:37.953 --> 30:40.688
I'm really glad that you got Jay back.

30:42.891 --> 30:45.559
You have no idea.

30:47.261 --> 30:48.730
Hey.

30:48.731 --> 30:50.765
I'm ordering Thai. What do you want?

30:50.766 --> 30:52.433
I'm not hungry.

30:52.434 --> 30:54.134
Come on, you got to eat.

30:55.236 --> 30:57.305
All right, look. If you can't accept it,

30:57.306 --> 30:59.574
then get back in there
and make your case.

30:59.575 --> 31:02.010
- You ju... you said...
- I know.

31:02.011 --> 31:04.545
But maybe if Piper knew how you felt...

31:04.546 --> 31:06.948
Sometimes that can turn the tide.

31:06.949 --> 31:08.683
It's too late.

31:08.684 --> 31:10.251
I'm already in the friend zone.

31:10.252 --> 31:13.121
Okay, look.

31:13.122 --> 31:16.557
Believe me, I know how scary
it can be to take a big risk,

31:16.558 --> 31:19.594
but sometimes that's the only
way to move things forward.

31:19.595 --> 31:23.031
Use the connection you already have.

31:23.032 --> 31:24.899
If you could lift the grounding,

31:24.900 --> 31:26.601
there's this zombie convention...

31:26.602 --> 31:28.870
Yeah, yeah. Good try, good try.

31:28.871 --> 31:30.371
Why don't you just call her?

31:30.372 --> 31:33.241
Like on the phone with no
texting and talk to her.

31:33.242 --> 31:35.977
Yeah. Who wants
to ride in a helicopter

31:35.978 --> 31:38.146
when you can actually talk
to somebody on the telephone?

31:38.147 --> 31:41.182
Perhaps later, we'll go get
phosphates at the drugstore

31:41.183 --> 31:44.218
and then go to the World's Fair
to admire the new gramophone.

31:44.219 --> 31:46.653
Yeah, you see? You're
not far off your game.

31:48.589 --> 31:50.258
No.

31:50.259 --> 31:51.793
You are not coming in.

31:51.794 --> 31:53.261
Are you crazy?

31:53.262 --> 31:56.698
Except we might be sending
you a list of possible suspects

31:56.699 --> 31:59.267
we're looking at now that
we know it wasn't Pirosmani.

31:59.268 --> 32:02.403
No rush. Maybe a bit of a rush.

32:02.404 --> 32:04.739
But just take some time, okay?

32:04.740 --> 32:06.674
We're just really glad you're back.

32:06.675 --> 32:07.474
All right.

32:07.475 --> 32:09.777
I'm not sure how much
of a help he'd be anyway.

32:09.778 --> 32:10.978
Anton Jankovic

32:10.979 --> 32:13.581
hasn't left the Bahamas in 18 months.

32:13.582 --> 32:16.751
Nassim retired, which
the Turks have confirmed.

32:16.752 --> 32:19.554
The Saudis have been shadowing
Kashadian for nearly a year.

32:19.555 --> 32:22.824
Every one of our leads
is either incapacitated,

32:22.825 --> 32:25.927
imprisoned or... dead.

32:25.928 --> 32:28.562
Then we start all over.

32:29.864 --> 32:32.867
Pull every bit of paperwork
attached to the leaks,

32:32.868 --> 32:34.769
go through 'em one by one.

32:34.770 --> 32:36.104
Yes, ma'am.

32:36.105 --> 32:38.071
Maybe we do need Jay.

32:44.879 --> 32:46.914
Hi.

32:48.951 --> 32:50.818
It's okay.

32:50.819 --> 32:53.453
It's okay. I'm okay.

33:00.696 --> 33:04.832
So... how was Nice, otherwise?

33:07.402 --> 33:09.637
My God.

33:09.638 --> 33:12.106
I wanted to bring you guys
some chocolates or something.

33:12.107 --> 33:14.041
No. We have the gift we need.

33:14.042 --> 33:15.743
We have it.

33:15.744 --> 33:17.411
You're okay?

33:17.412 --> 33:20.181
- I mean, really okay?
- Yes, yes.

33:20.182 --> 33:21.883
I'm sorry if I worried you.

33:21.884 --> 33:24.685
It's not like it was your fault.

33:24.686 --> 33:26.888
Well, maybe if I'd run
a little faster, but...

33:34.028 --> 33:37.298
Chloe's still at day
care, but please come in.

33:37.299 --> 33:38.833
They need me back already.

33:38.834 --> 33:41.169
No. You cannot be serious.

33:41.170 --> 33:42.637
It's a big thing.

33:42.638 --> 33:44.738
Of course it is.

33:45.606 --> 33:49.710
Hey, I just wanted you to know I'm okay.

33:49.711 --> 33:51.712
I mean, about us.

33:51.713 --> 33:54.549
I just don't want there to be any...

33:54.550 --> 33:57.185
Yeah.

33:57.186 --> 34:00.221
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:00.222 --> 34:02.190
Okay, thanks.

34:02.191 --> 34:04.491
Okay.

34:05.293 --> 34:07.361
So I'll come by tonight to see Chloe?

34:07.362 --> 34:09.530
- If that's all right?
- Yes. Yeah, of course.

34:09.531 --> 34:13.266
She will be over the moon to see you.

35:27.834 --> 35:30.126
I can't believe you did that.

35:31.211 --> 35:33.712
You just couldn't let it go, could you?

35:35.848 --> 35:38.784
Are you talking about Pirosmani?

35:38.785 --> 35:40.193
You went behind my back,

35:40.194 --> 35:42.488
disregarded my recommendation
and the president's orders.

35:42.489 --> 35:44.423
We had nothing to do
with that assassination.

35:44.424 --> 35:46.192
Then why is the hotel reporting

35:46.193 --> 35:47.960
that a group of Americans showed up

35:47.961 --> 35:49.795
right before Pirosmani's room was hit?

35:49.796 --> 35:51.764
The guy had plenty of enemies.

35:51.765 --> 35:54.600
Am I sorry that one of
them did the job for us? No.

35:54.601 --> 35:56.869
But it wasn't us.

35:56.870 --> 36:00.138
Elizabeth, we had nothing to do with it.

36:01.844 --> 36:03.093
I hate being wrong.

36:03.094 --> 36:04.467
Now, I don't know if
this'll be good news or not,

36:04.468 --> 36:06.063
but Defense Intelligence
shared their files on movement

36:06.064 --> 36:07.696
- in and out of Somalia in the past...
- I'm sorry.

36:07.697 --> 36:09.231
- I just have to do this again.
- Two months.

36:09.232 --> 36:10.733
We are so glad that you're back.

36:10.734 --> 36:12.001
It's extremely mutual, ma'am.

36:12.002 --> 36:13.548
I mean, I'm sorry to
call you in already.

36:13.549 --> 36:15.137
- But, okay, you were saying? Go ahead.
- Right.

36:15.138 --> 36:17.272
So Dito Pirosmani's private plane here,

36:17.273 --> 36:19.575
and this was a week later.

36:19.576 --> 36:22.511
Paul Crane. Why do I know that name?

36:22.512 --> 36:24.013
Independent risk management

36:24.014 --> 36:26.649
and defense contractor, works
with a lot of different firms.

36:26.650 --> 36:30.218
And here's a list of
his most recent partners.

36:36.125 --> 36:38.394
Mr. Brennan, ma'am.

36:38.395 --> 36:41.630
Daryl. Thanks so much for
coming in to see me again.

36:41.631 --> 36:44.533
- We're gonna get people talking.
- We are.

36:44.534 --> 36:47.102
You remember my senior
policy advisor, Jay Whitman?

36:47.103 --> 36:49.672
- Good to see you.
- You, too.

36:49.673 --> 36:51.306
Well, as I mentioned, we...

36:51.307 --> 36:55.559
We wanted to go over some things
about the operation in Somalia.

36:55.560 --> 36:57.120
How can I help?

36:57.371 --> 37:01.178
We've been tracking some
stolen military equipment.

37:01.179 --> 37:03.213
Sniper rifles and AT4s mostly.

37:03.214 --> 37:05.049
Also quite a few M16s.

37:05.050 --> 37:07.451
Though I hear they're temperamental.

37:07.452 --> 37:09.253
These rebel groups aren't too picky,

37:09.254 --> 37:11.483
- and we know who armed them.
- Of course.

37:11.484 --> 37:13.985
Dito Pirosmani. That's
what we thought, too.

37:13.986 --> 37:15.921
Made perfect sense, right?

37:15.922 --> 37:19.024
Known illegal arms dealer who
regularly operates in Africa.

37:19.025 --> 37:21.593
But then, looking into it,

37:21.594 --> 37:25.931
turns out, Pirosmani never
deals in U.S. weaponry.

37:25.932 --> 37:28.133
He's right careful about that.

37:28.134 --> 37:30.202
Almost principled.

37:30.203 --> 37:31.503
Yeah.

37:31.504 --> 37:33.338
I'd call Dito Pirosmani a lot of things,

37:33.339 --> 37:35.207
but principled is not one of them.

37:35.208 --> 37:36.308
What's your point?

37:36.309 --> 37:41.213
The week after Pirosmani
flew into Mogadishu,

37:41.214 --> 37:44.850
presumably to make his deal
with the Somali rebel armies,

37:44.851 --> 37:48.620
we noticed another arrival
of note... Paul Crane?

37:48.621 --> 37:51.189
- I've worked with Paul.
- Yeah.

37:51.190 --> 37:53.725
I would hate to think he's
capable of something like that.

37:53.726 --> 37:55.060
Hell of an allegation.

37:55.061 --> 37:56.828
That's why we wanted to be sure.

37:56.829 --> 37:59.898
So the FBI brought Mr.
Crane in, and he did confirm

37:59.899 --> 38:01.933
that he was working
for your company during

38:01.934 --> 38:05.169
that particular mission.

38:06.138 --> 38:11.243
I'm going to use a term
I usually don't like.

38:11.244 --> 38:14.246
Paul Crane is a mercenary.

38:14.247 --> 38:17.349
He'd say whatever it
takes to save his own skin.

38:17.350 --> 38:19.885
Would you like to see how
we confirmed what he told us?

38:19.886 --> 38:21.119
Well, you're welcome to share whatever

38:21.120 --> 38:22.754
you think you have
with my legal counsel.

38:22.755 --> 38:25.624
I don't appreciate being set
up by one of my competitors.

38:25.625 --> 38:29.060
Maybe you should call
your legal counsel.

38:29.061 --> 38:32.063
Daryl Brennan, FBI.

38:32.064 --> 38:33.799
You're under arrest for the theft

38:33.800 --> 38:35.433
of United States government property

38:35.434 --> 38:38.870
and the murders of Barry
Milken and Agent Joseph Garcia.

38:38.871 --> 38:40.572
You have the right to remain silent.

38:40.573 --> 38:42.140
Anything you say can and will be used

38:42.141 --> 38:43.742
against you in a court of law.

38:43.743 --> 38:45.410
You have the right to
speak to an attorney

38:45.411 --> 38:48.345
and to have an attorney
present during any questioning.

38:55.687 --> 38:57.622
If you're gonna drown
your sorrow watching

38:57.623 --> 38:59.257
these chick flicks, could you at least

38:59.258 --> 39:00.559
turn it down or go upstairs

39:00.560 --> 39:01.827
- or something?
- Just...

39:01.828 --> 39:03.862
Okay, look, I know you're scared,

39:03.863 --> 39:05.597
but at a certain
point, you're just gonna

39:05.598 --> 39:06.932
- have to talk to her.
- Dad.

39:06.933 --> 39:08.934
That's what I'm doing right now,

39:08.935 --> 39:12.571
and you're kind of
totally blowing it for me.

39:12.572 --> 39:13.905
Piper's on my laptop.

39:13.906 --> 39:17.241
It's like a virtual hang situation. See?

39:20.245 --> 39:21.980
O-Okay, you two have got

39:21.981 --> 39:24.249
to get over your fear of
sharing physical space.

39:24.250 --> 39:26.284
I would love to have
her in my physical space,

39:26.285 --> 39:28.019
but she's grounded, too.

39:28.020 --> 39:29.354
Really?

39:29.355 --> 39:31.690
Okay, come on. Go.

39:31.691 --> 39:32.858
What...? Why is she grounded?

39:32.859 --> 39:34.426
For the helicopter ride.

39:34.427 --> 39:36.194
Which she hated, by
the way, but she kind of

39:36.195 --> 39:37.829
got roped in and couldn't say no.

39:37.830 --> 39:40.432
- And then she puked.
- That's bad.

39:40.433 --> 39:42.567
Yeah, if by bad you mean
awesome, then it's really bad.

39:42.568 --> 39:44.436
Okay, go on, just go back to your movie.

39:44.437 --> 39:46.304
- Okay.
- I got to go back to work for a while.

39:46.305 --> 39:48.039
- Bye, Piper.
- Bye, Dr. McCord.

39:48.040 --> 39:49.674
No funny business, you two.

39:51.811 --> 39:53.745
So the whole arms smuggling thing...

39:53.746 --> 39:56.581
was that Vesuvian or just Brennan?

39:56.582 --> 39:58.375
He was the only one on the take.

39:58.376 --> 40:00.418
Apparently he was massively in debt,

40:00.419 --> 40:02.623
thanks to our skill in solving conflict

40:02.624 --> 40:04.737
with diplomacy instead of shooting wars.

40:04.738 --> 40:05.938
Go, us.

40:05.939 --> 40:07.584
He organized this whole side deal

40:07.585 --> 40:09.942
selling stolen weaponry
to cover his debts.

40:09.943 --> 40:13.212
And, when the CIA
started closing in on him,

40:13.213 --> 40:15.981
that's when he ordered the hit

40:15.982 --> 40:17.583
on Joseph Garcia.

40:17.584 --> 40:18.751
In the State Department.

40:18.752 --> 40:20.419
That's insane.

40:20.420 --> 40:22.057
Sorry, what was the story
with Barry Milken, then?

40:22.058 --> 40:23.756
So, he was helping
Brennan cover up the theft

40:23.757 --> 40:25.551
from the Texas arms depot.

40:25.552 --> 40:27.393
And as soon as Brennan
thought that Milken

40:27.394 --> 40:29.028
was gonna cut a deal with the FBI,

40:29.029 --> 40:31.697
he ordered to have him shot by a sniper.

40:31.698 --> 40:33.332
There he is.

40:33.333 --> 40:35.901
I can't believe we
had to call you in today.

40:35.902 --> 40:37.169
I was happy to do it.

40:37.170 --> 40:38.237
Yeah, he'd rather be here.

40:38.238 --> 40:39.772
I've seen his apartment, trust me.

40:41.374 --> 40:43.509
Well, I'm buying drinks

40:43.510 --> 40:45.811
if you're not dead on your feet.

40:45.812 --> 40:48.080
That did not come out right.

40:48.081 --> 40:49.882
- I heard drinks.
- Yeah.

40:49.883 --> 40:51.162
Yeah.

40:51.163 --> 40:53.752
I might catch up with you guys.
I got a... I got time with Chloe,

40:53.753 --> 40:56.055
- I just... I don't want to miss.
- Good.

40:56.056 --> 40:57.056
Nadine?

40:57.057 --> 40:59.525
I just got word that Kevin Park...

40:59.526 --> 41:03.462
well, Agent Garcia, will be
honored in the annual ceremony

41:03.463 --> 41:06.265
at the CIA memorial wall tomorrow.

41:06.266 --> 41:08.734
Of course. I should have realized.

41:08.735 --> 41:11.470
And I know they're not even
gonna be able to say his name,

41:11.471 --> 41:13.038
but I'd like to be there.

41:13.039 --> 41:14.940
You should absolutely come.

41:14.941 --> 41:17.076
Thank you.

41:17.077 --> 41:18.277
Come on.

41:18.278 --> 41:19.744
Okay.

41:25.718 --> 41:27.186
Hey.

41:27.187 --> 41:28.187
Are we doing this?

41:28.188 --> 41:30.121
Yeah.

41:34.460 --> 41:37.863
SIGINT got a hit from an
intercepted phone conversation.

41:37.864 --> 41:39.064
Voice recognition confirmed

41:39.065 --> 41:41.800
it's one of our VFF
leaders, Lance Abbott.

41:41.801 --> 41:44.136
The call came from a
road in the Syrian Golan,

41:44.137 --> 41:45.736
about here.

41:48.841 --> 41:50.775
But that's not their final destination.

41:53.579 --> 41:54.813
It's Jerusalem.

41:54.814 --> 41:56.482
Security

41:56.483 --> 42:00.319
is more than the absence of threat.

42:00.320 --> 42:03.989
The silent soldiers of the
Central Intelligence Agency

42:03.990 --> 42:05.324
work throughout the world,

42:05.325 --> 42:08.260
in some of its most dangerous places,

42:08.261 --> 42:11.663
to bring us to a
deeper state of security

42:11.664 --> 42:13.899
through connection,

42:13.900 --> 42:16.668
trust and alliance,

42:16.669 --> 42:19.238
the building blocks of peace.

42:19.239 --> 42:24.943
We honor, today, those who
faced extraordinary hazard

42:24.944 --> 42:28.680
and made the ultimate
sacrifice for our security.

42:28.681 --> 42:32.084
While their names cannot be known,

42:32.085 --> 42:34.286
the fearless work that
they do brings us all

42:34.287 --> 42:38.422
one step closer to a
world of true security.
