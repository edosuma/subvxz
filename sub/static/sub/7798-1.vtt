00:47.600 --> 00:52.040
Don't forget to tell Uncle Louie I left
the red wine and Parmesan in the fridge.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.680
I love you. Bye-bye.

00:53.760 --> 00:55.640
- 'Bye, Judy.
- Send me a picture.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.720
I'll be back soon. Don't worry about it.

00:57.880 --> 01:00.440
- Be careful, now.
- 'Bye.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.519
- Take it easy, now.
- 'Bye.

01:30.120 --> 01:32.840
"California, here we come"

01:33.360 --> 01:35.600
What's wrong? Don't you like my singing?

01:35.720 --> 01:36.960
I don't like the song.

01:37.080 --> 01:39.960
You're going to love California.
You get up in the morning...

01:40.080 --> 01:41.880
...roll out of bed, plop, in the pool.

01:42.080 --> 01:43.040
Yeah, sure.

01:43.280 --> 01:47.000
You'll see. This isn't exactly a dump
we're moving to.

02:53.360 --> 02:57.640
Push, Daniel.
Give it all you've got, kid. Push!

02:58.560 --> 03:01.760
Okay, we've got it. Come on.
Get in, hurry up.

03:04.520 --> 03:07.320
We did it again. Way to go!

03:33.720 --> 03:35.880
Daniel, wake up.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.280
Look off the starboard bow.
Paradise at last.

03:41.440 --> 03:42.920
We made it.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.240
Come on.

03:45.320 --> 03:46.520
This is it.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.720
This is the end of the line.

03:50.560 --> 03:51.960
You're telling me.

03:52.840 --> 03:55.160
Come on. All hands on deck.

03:56.920 --> 04:00.400
We've got to get this thing unloaded
before it sinks.

04:02.240 --> 04:05.800
Look at those palm trees!
Damn, do you know what that means?

04:06.000 --> 04:08.320
Yeah, watch out for falling coconuts.

04:08.560 --> 04:12.320
- Wise guy. No more Newark winters.
- I like winters.

04:12.440 --> 04:15.240
Oh, you like sore throats?
You like frozen toes?

04:15.600 --> 04:16.920
I don't like smog.

04:17.160 --> 04:20.279
- Did I tell you about the pool here?
- About 100 times.

04:20.399 --> 04:22.600
Okay, so make it 101.

04:22.720 --> 04:27.160
Open your eyes, my darling son.
This is the Garden of Eden.

04:27.240 --> 04:30.720
Come on.
Listen, we're in apartment 20, okay?

04:30.920 --> 04:32.640
One flight up.

04:51.080 --> 04:53.040
- Are you okay?
- Don't worry about it.

04:53.280 --> 04:54.760
- Let me help you up.
- Thanks.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.840
I shouldn't have done that. It was stupid.

04:57.320 --> 04:59.200
You must be the new people in 20, right?

04:59.320 --> 05:00.320
Yeah, I guess so.

05:00.520 --> 05:02.800
- Freddy Fernandez, apartment 17.
- Daniel LaRusso.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.240
How you doing? Let me help.

05:04.360 --> 05:07.760
- No, it's fine. It's heavy, man.
- I got it.

05:08.320 --> 05:10.120
- Where are you from?
- New Jersey.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.680
What are you doing out here?

05:11.840 --> 05:14.960
My mom got a job with some company
out here. Rocket Computers.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.720
Flight of the Future. I don't know.

05:16.840 --> 05:19.560
- I never heard of it.
- It's up and coming.

05:20.400 --> 05:24.680
- Is this the only pool you've got?
- That's it. What was that, karate?

05:25.760 --> 05:28.000
- Yeah.
- Have you been doing it long?

05:28.120 --> 05:30.400
- Yeah, a while.
- Did you ever use it?

05:30.520 --> 05:33.240
- A couple of times.
- I bet you could kick some ass.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.200
I'd like to learn that.
Maybe you could teach me.

05:36.320 --> 05:38.280
- Sure. That's cool. Anytime.
- Great.

05:38.400 --> 05:41.360
This place is a dump.
You should go back to New Jersey.

05:42.480 --> 05:44.040
How did you know where I was from?

05:44.160 --> 05:46.960
'Cause I'm from New Jersey.
I got a nose for my own.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.560
- Well what part?
- Parsippany.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.600
- I never should've left.
- My Uncle Louie's from Parsippany.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.280
- Louie Martini?
- Louie LaRusso.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.880
Louie LaRusso? Don't know him.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.400
Hey, pup.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.520
How you doing? You thirsty?

06:02.280 --> 06:03.920
- She's crazy.
- What?

06:04.040 --> 06:06.600
- She's not playing with a full deck.
- She's nice.

06:06.720 --> 06:09.600
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- I don't know. I guess nothing.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.640
We're having a beach party.
Want to come?

06:12.720 --> 06:15.680
- Sure, that's cool.
- I'll come get you in the morning.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.000
Here's apartment 20.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.880
- Is it?
- Should I leave this here?

06:20.000 --> 06:22.720
- Yeah, thanks for the help.
- No problem.

06:22.800 --> 06:26.520
Nice meeting you. Take care.
See you tomorrow morning.

06:28.560 --> 06:32.240
Don't say anything about the pool.
I'll call first thing in the morning.

06:32.400 --> 06:35.040
Did you tell that old lady
where we were from?

06:35.120 --> 06:37.160
Yes. Didn't she remind you of Aunt Tessy?

06:38.080 --> 06:41.720
- More like Uncle Louie.
- I really think we're going to do good here.

06:41.840 --> 06:44.480
I have a very positive feeling.
I'm telling you, Daniel.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.440
I just know it's going to work.
The faucet's broken.

06:47.520 --> 06:51.400
The real estate lady said there's
a fix-it guy. See if you can find him.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.120
What's that for?

06:54.720 --> 06:56.440
- Uncle Louie's dog.
- He's cute.

06:56.520 --> 06:59.320
- I got invited to a party tomorrow.
- Great. You see?

06:59.560 --> 07:03.280
- But you wanted me to help you unpack.
- I don't remember saying that.

07:04.360 --> 07:07.320
I must have had you mixed up
with somebody else.

07:07.440 --> 07:08.600
Thanks, Ma.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.680
Could you tell me
where the maintenance guy is?

07:14.960 --> 07:16.360
Hey, pup.

07:16.480 --> 07:20.040
You go in through there,
turn left, not too far...

07:20.280 --> 07:23.080
...then right, go inside, and you'll find him
on the left.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.680
So I go right then left?

07:24.800 --> 07:28.040
No, left then right, then inside on the left.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.920
Hello?

07:54.680 --> 07:56.320
Are you the maintenance man?

07:58.160 --> 08:00.280
We're the new people in apartment 20.

08:02.360 --> 08:04.840
The faucet's really leaking there.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.320
Could you come fix it?

08:16.240 --> 08:17.800
Can I tell my mom when?

08:18.480 --> 08:19.640
When what?

08:21.520 --> 08:23.240
When you're going to fix the faucet.

08:23.400 --> 08:24.400
After.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.640
After what?

08:26.760 --> 08:28.320
After after!

09:17.040 --> 09:20.160
Could we have the ball, please?

09:20.240 --> 09:21.720
Pretty good.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.280
Show-off.

09:26.760 --> 09:29.880
Sorry. Hey, wait up.

09:32.440 --> 09:35.160
- Who's that blonde in the blue?
- The hills.

09:35.600 --> 09:38.160
- What's the hills?
- Rich.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.840
- I think the blonde is looking at you.
- Yeah, right.

09:59.920 --> 10:03.880
- I think she has the hots for you.
- Who could blame her?

10:04.160 --> 10:06.560
- Why don't you make a move?
- No, I'm eating, man.

10:06.680 --> 10:09.320
- How can you think about eating?
- I'm hungry.

10:09.440 --> 10:13.640
- Maybe they ain't got no moves in Jersey.
- I got moves where I come from.

10:13.840 --> 10:17.240
We've got more moves back there
than here, I'll tell you that much.

10:17.880 --> 10:19.920
Let's see 'em.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.680
Come on, buddy. Go get her.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.960
I'm going.

10:28.680 --> 10:31.080
- Lose something?
- I hope we're not bothering you.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.120
Hey, how do you juggle?

10:33.240 --> 10:38.000
It's pretty easy. You start on the knee.
You just go one.

10:38.160 --> 10:41.120
One at a time. Then you try two.
One, two.

10:42.200 --> 10:45.520
And then three and four.
Try it. Just bring your leg up. Good!

10:52.520 --> 10:56.720
- That was awesome!
- Brew time. Who's for a warm one?

10:56.840 --> 10:57.960
No, I pass.

10:59.160 --> 11:01.320
Who are you kidding?
You're the ace degenerate.

11:01.640 --> 11:06.280
Ex-degenerate. Tomorrow I'm a senior.
I've got one year to make it all work.

11:06.400 --> 11:10.040
And that's what I'm gonna do.
Make it work, all of it.

11:10.160 --> 11:13.920
You must be a trendsetter, Johnny.
Everyone's doing something new.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.520
Take a right. Check it out.

11:17.720 --> 11:20.840
- Forget it, man. It's ancient history.
- Who told you, man?

11:21.880 --> 11:24.080
- I thought they broke up.
- She did, he didn't.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.520
Come on, try it.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.160
Watch this.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.240
I'll get it. I'll be right back.

11:48.880 --> 11:51.760
- Ali, I want to talk to you.
- Leave me alone.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.280
We've been over all this.
I don't want to talk.

11:54.640 --> 11:56.880
I want to talk to you, all right?

11:57.920 --> 12:01.480
- What is your problem?
- Just get out of here.

12:01.600 --> 12:05.200
- That won't solve anything.
- Give me my radio.

12:05.360 --> 12:06.840
I said, give me my radio.

12:07.120 --> 12:09.760
- You promise you'll talk to me?
- Yes, give me my radio.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.200
- You just broke my radio!
- Yeah.

12:17.640 --> 12:19.280
Don't touch it, punk.

12:22.360 --> 12:25.080
- What's going on?
- You want it?

12:33.600 --> 12:35.320
Johnny, stop it.

12:39.320 --> 12:41.880
- Stop it.
- I didn't do anything.

12:47.480 --> 12:49.200
You're a big man now, huh?

12:50.000 --> 12:52.720
You started this. I just wanted to talk.

12:53.360 --> 12:56.840
- Leave him alone and we'll talk.
- Where did I hear that before?

12:58.200 --> 13:00.600
How about you, hero? Had enough?

13:02.920 --> 13:05.880
- Now we're even.
- No mercy, man.

13:16.640 --> 13:19.840
Why don't you hit me?

13:19.960 --> 13:21.280
- It's your fault!
- It's not.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.280
- It's your fault.
- Ever think it's yours?

13:23.480 --> 13:25.040
Why do you always have to fight?

13:25.160 --> 13:27.640
Bullshit. Get on your bikes, guys.

13:35.960 --> 13:37.960
You sure pick cool people
to be friends with.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.000
Where'd you find this guy?

13:40.440 --> 13:42.840
Come on, let's go. He'll be all right.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.920
- Are you okay?
- Just leave me alone.

13:55.440 --> 13:58.640
- I'll help you.
- Leave me alone. I'm okay.

13:58.760 --> 14:02.320
Come on, Ali. Let's go.
It's better if you leave him alone.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.320
Come on, let's go.

14:26.400 --> 14:27.960
Daniel!

14:32.200 --> 14:34.760
- How was the party?
- It was okay.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.920
Must have been more than okay.
I didn't hear you come in.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.720
- Any friend material?
- Some. I got to go.

14:40.960 --> 14:42.680
- Eat first.
- I'm not hungry.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.840
- You need energy to be charming.
- I'm fine, I got energy.

14:46.040 --> 14:48.160
Do me a favour. Take off the glasses.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.600
- Why?
- Because I asked you to.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.760
- It's California. It's the look.
- I want to see your baby browns.

14:55.640 --> 14:58.200
- Come on with the baby browns.
- Are you on something?

14:58.840 --> 15:00.720
- I'm on Minute Maid.
- Why hide your eyes?

15:00.840 --> 15:03.400
- I'm not.
- Take off the glasses.

15:03.600 --> 15:04.720
Now!

15:09.560 --> 15:11.920
My God! How did that happen?

15:13.360 --> 15:16.840
I hit a kerb with my bike.
I wore the glasses so you wouldn't worry.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.200
- It looks worse than it feels.
- Don't do that.

15:19.320 --> 15:22.360
- It doesn't hurt.
- Can you see? You want to stay home?

15:22.440 --> 15:23.360
I've got to go.

16:21.680 --> 16:24.920
- Hey, you guys, Freddy, how you doing?
- Hey, the karate kid.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.720
Let's see the moves.

16:27.160 --> 16:30.120
- He knows how to get his butt kicked.
- I already know that move.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.200
Let's get out of here.

16:32.280 --> 16:33.320
Hey, think fast.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.120
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you doing?

16:36.240 --> 16:39.560
- Your eye.
- It looks worse than it feels. Believe me.

16:39.720 --> 16:40.880
I hope so.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.880
I never got a chance to thank you.

16:44.360 --> 16:47.400
That was nothing.
I'm just sorry about your radio.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.800
I'm more sorry about your eye.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.520
You should've just given it to him.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.280
Why? It wasn't his, right?

16:54.600 --> 16:57.640
- Yeah, it wasn't his.
- We think alike already.

16:58.360 --> 16:59.920
You know what else we do alike?

17:02.600 --> 17:04.800
You've been practicing.

17:04.920 --> 17:07.560
- Cheerleaders, over here.
- I've got to go.

17:07.720 --> 17:10.160
- I'll see you.
- 'Bye.

17:10.280 --> 17:13.760
- Hey, have you got a name?
- Ali with an "i."

17:14.960 --> 17:18.839
- What's your name?
- Daniel with an "I."

17:19.920 --> 17:21.640
I'll see you later.

17:23.079 --> 17:24.560
Definitely.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.560
Get him, Bobby.

18:06.080 --> 18:07.480
Have a nice trip?

18:08.560 --> 18:10.680
Look what he's doing to Bobby.

18:11.480 --> 18:14.440
Nobody hits me. I'm going to kill him.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.280
- None of that on this team!
- He hooked me!

18:18.400 --> 18:20.120
I said out of here!

18:21.080 --> 18:22.720
Back to it. Let's go.

18:22.840 --> 18:25.880
This school sucks! It sucks.

18:48.040 --> 18:51.800
52, 53, 54...

18:52.560 --> 18:56.440
55, 56, 57...

18:57.520 --> 18:59.680
- Fix faucet.
- Come on in.

18:59.880 --> 19:01.360
It's the kitchen one.

19:01.960 --> 19:05.600
1, 2, 3...

19:05.800 --> 19:06.920
Karate.

19:07.640 --> 19:11.320
- Yeah, 5, 6...
- Very good.

19:12.880 --> 19:17.000
- Learn from book?
- And a few months at the Y in Newark.

19:17.120 --> 19:19.680
9, 10...

19:20.560 --> 19:24.440
...11, 12, 13...

19:28.160 --> 19:29.640
What happened to eye?

19:29.960 --> 19:31.680
I fell off my bike.

19:36.080 --> 19:37.880
Lucky no hurt hand.

19:55.720 --> 19:58.760
- Ali with an "i." How are you doing?
- Good.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.640
- Not too hungry today?
- Not really.

20:02.280 --> 20:03.920
Have some pie, I made it myself.

20:05.640 --> 20:08.680
- How do you like the valley?
- It hasn't been dull.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.080
Was Newark dull?

20:11.200 --> 20:13.000
How did you know I was from there?

20:13.080 --> 20:15.320
- I asked.
- Oh, really?

20:16.200 --> 20:18.840
- Are you sitting with anybody?
- With you, if it's okay.

20:18.920 --> 20:21.360
- Sounds great to me. Want some milk?
- Thanks.

20:22.280 --> 20:25.600
- Sorry about the soccer tryouts.
- Those are the breaks.

20:25.960 --> 20:28.680
Remember that guy you had trouble with
on the beach?

20:28.840 --> 20:32.160
- Yeah, King Karate?
- He's my ex-boyfriend.

20:32.680 --> 20:34.400
That's good to know. What?

20:35.400 --> 20:36.880
Yeah, you're right. I know.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.800
- What are you doing?
- It's this little voice...

20:39.880 --> 20:42.680
...telling me I've got to be nuts
to be talking to you.

20:42.760 --> 20:45.640
- That'll be $2.50.
- For both.

20:46.480 --> 20:50.280
- $3.75.
- It doesn't matter, anyway.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.880
- Why's that?
- Because it's over.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.280
- Wait. How over?
- Weeks.

20:56.560 --> 20:58.360
One week, five weeks?
How many weeks is "weeks"?

21:08.320 --> 21:12.200
<i>- Fear does not exist in this dojo. Does it?
- No, Sensei!</i>

21:12.320 --> 21:16.080
<i>- Pain does not exist in this dojo. Does it?
- No, Sensei!</i>

21:16.240 --> 21:20.840
<i>- Defeat doesn't exist in this dojo. Does it?
- No, Sensei!</i>

21:21.000 --> 21:25.360
<i>- Fear does not exist in this dojo. Does it?
- No, Sensei!</i>

21:25.440 --> 21:29.720
<i>- Pain does not exist in this dojo. Does it?
- No, Sensei!</i>

21:29.920 --> 21:35.120
<i>- Defeat doesn't exist in this dojo. Does it?
- No, Sensei!</i>

21:35.320 --> 21:36.360
Prepare.

21:40.080 --> 21:43.320
- What do we study here?
- The way of the fist, sir!

21:43.720 --> 21:48.160
- And what is that way?
- Strike first, strike hard, no mercy!

21:48.360 --> 21:53.280
- I can't hear you.
- Strike first, strike hard, no mercy!

21:55.320 --> 21:57.360
<i>- Mr. Lawrence.
- Yes, Sensei.</i>

21:58.400 --> 22:00.040
Warm them up.

22:14.920 --> 22:17.560
Fighting positions. Jab punch.

22:17.960 --> 22:19.000
Ready.

22:27.840 --> 22:31.800
Guess what.
I'm going to be trained as a manager.

22:32.200 --> 22:33.760
Isn't that great?

22:34.440 --> 22:36.400
The programme's two nights a week.

22:36.520 --> 22:41.800
As soon as a spot opens up, I'm in.
The benefits are great.

22:42.320 --> 22:44.200
They pay for everything.

22:45.440 --> 22:46.920
That's great.

22:48.760 --> 22:51.320
- What's the matter, Daniel?
- Nothing.

22:53.600 --> 22:57.280
Remember when you went to the country
and hated it 'cause you had no friends?

22:57.400 --> 22:58.720
What happened?

23:00.200 --> 23:01.680
I got poison ivy.

23:01.800 --> 23:05.520
You met Kevin and Kenny,
who became your best friends in the world.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.480
You've got to give it a try.

23:09.840 --> 23:11.960
I know it's hard.

23:12.560 --> 23:14.280
We're not quitters, are we?

23:14.680 --> 23:16.000
I guess not.

23:17.160 --> 23:20.120
- What's with the karate place?
- It sucks.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.920
Good. We couldn't afford it anyway.

23:23.680 --> 23:25.240
And the girl situation?

23:25.960 --> 23:28.400
- It's okay.
- Just okay?

23:28.760 --> 23:31.720
To me it looks like
the whole world turned blonde.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.920
You got your eye on anybody?

23:37.000 --> 23:38.040
Cute?

23:38.240 --> 23:39.480
Not cute.

23:40.360 --> 23:44.240
- She's beyond cute.
- But she's blonde, right?

23:44.480 --> 23:47.840
- She's got blonde hair.
- Lucille, let's go, here they come.

23:47.960 --> 23:51.480
- Is she as pretty as Judy?
- She buries Judy in a second.

23:51.600 --> 23:53.760
She buries Judy?

23:54.320 --> 23:58.200
Tell me about it later. I love you.
Careful how you ride home.

24:00.120 --> 24:04.160
She's got an excellent smile.
She's really smart.

24:06.920 --> 24:10.320
I'd say she's beautiful.
I think she's beautiful.

24:11.040 --> 24:12.920
I think she's something else.

24:14.480 --> 24:16.480
She's hot. Definitely hot.

24:44.400 --> 24:48.880
- Looking for a shortcut to Newark?
- He wants to learn karate.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.360
Here's the first lesson: How to take a fall.
Don't think about the pain.

25:23.720 --> 25:25.760
Damn bike! I hate this bike!

25:25.920 --> 25:28.960
I hate this frigging bike! Stupid bike!

25:30.400 --> 25:33.040
What's the matter?
Why did you throw your bike away?

25:33.120 --> 25:36.240
- Because I felt like it.
- Look at me when I'm talking to you.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.520
My God!

25:39.800 --> 25:42.520
Tell me what's going on.
Don't say another bike accident.

25:42.680 --> 25:44.680
- What do you want to hear?
- The truth.

25:44.840 --> 25:47.400
No, all you want to hear
is how great it is here.

25:47.520 --> 25:50.080
Maybe for you, but it sucks for me.
I hate this place!

25:50.160 --> 25:53.640
I hate it, I want to go home!
Why can't we just go back home?

25:54.640 --> 25:56.120
Listen to me.

25:56.200 --> 25:58.840
I cannot help you
unless you tell me what's wrong.

25:58.960 --> 26:00.360
I've got to take karate.

26:00.480 --> 26:04.040
- You took karate.
- Not at the Y, at a good school.

26:04.240 --> 26:07.560
- Fighting doesn't solve anything.
- Neither does palm trees.

26:07.680 --> 26:09.160
That's not fair.

26:09.640 --> 26:13.600
It wasn't fair coming out here
without asking me.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.280
You're right.

26:18.600 --> 26:19.840
I should've asked.

26:19.960 --> 26:23.560
I just want to go home.
I don't understand the rules here.

26:23.680 --> 26:26.640
Let's see if we can figure out
the rules together.

26:26.760 --> 26:29.800
- What about your bike?
- It's safer taking the bus.

26:29.920 --> 26:33.400
Why can't we just go home
and forget this place?

26:54.680 --> 26:57.320
- I'll tell you everything he said.
- You'd better.

27:09.840 --> 27:10.920
How are you?

27:11.040 --> 27:14.840
- What happened to your forehead?
- It's terrible. A gigantic runaway zit.

27:14.960 --> 27:16.680
That's gross.

27:17.400 --> 27:20.920
Daniel, this is Susan.
What really happened?

27:21.040 --> 27:22.920
I got in a bike accident.

27:23.920 --> 27:26.720
What kind of bike do you have?
A Honda? Suzuki?

27:28.120 --> 27:29.920
It's a Miyagi Turbo.

27:30.040 --> 27:32.240
- Yeah?
- Oh, really?

27:32.360 --> 27:35.320
- We're going to the arcade. Want to come?
- Sounds great.

27:35.400 --> 27:37.960
There's this new game I want to show you.

27:41.680 --> 27:46.120
I forgot something.
I'll catch up with you guys in a minute.

27:46.200 --> 27:48.840
- Don't run away.
- I'm not running away from anything.

27:49.120 --> 27:53.080
- We've got to deal with this.
- I'll deal with it my own way.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.920
- Daniel...
- Get off my case!

28:31.840 --> 28:34.960
Did you fix my bike?

28:35.360 --> 28:37.480
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

28:37.600 --> 28:39.560
I really appreciate that.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.160
Are those real trees?

28:44.120 --> 28:46.480
You like see, come inside.

28:47.280 --> 28:48.320
Thanks.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.920
How did they get so small?

28:58.040 --> 28:59.520
I train.

28:59.760 --> 29:02.040
Clip here, tie there.

29:03.120 --> 29:04.920
Did you learn this in Japan?

29:05.080 --> 29:06.240
Okinawa.

29:06.360 --> 29:07.480
Where's that?

29:08.160 --> 29:09.360
My country.

29:10.960 --> 29:12.160
China here.

29:12.560 --> 29:13.960
Japan here.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.040
Okinawa here.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.560
Did you go to school for this?

29:19.640 --> 29:20.840
Father teach.

29:21.560 --> 29:22.960
Was he a gardener?

29:23.560 --> 29:24.680
Fisherman.

29:24.840 --> 29:26.000
A fisherman.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.920
These are really beautiful.

29:29.720 --> 29:31.120
Come, you try.

29:31.280 --> 29:33.080
I don't know how to do this stuff.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.840
- Sit down.
- I may mess it up or something.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.320
Close eyes.

29:40.200 --> 29:41.160
Trust.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.240
Concentrate.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.480
Think only tree.

29:52.240 --> 29:55.920
Make a perfect picture
down to last pine needle.

29:57.320 --> 30:01.440
Wipe your mind clean.
Everything but the tree.

30:03.040 --> 30:05.920
Nothing exists in whole world...

30:06.240 --> 30:08.240
...only tree.

30:10.480 --> 30:11.560
You got it?

30:12.880 --> 30:14.360
Open eyes.

30:15.720 --> 30:17.120
Remember picture?

30:18.280 --> 30:19.320
Yeah.

30:20.240 --> 30:21.720
Make like picture.

30:30.920 --> 30:33.120
Just trust the picture.

30:34.120 --> 30:36.360
How do I know my picture's the right one?

30:36.480 --> 30:40.160
If come from inside you,
always the right one.

31:13.360 --> 31:14.360
Hi.

31:15.120 --> 31:16.600
Hi, Ma, come on in.

31:18.080 --> 31:21.200
- You fixed your bike.
- Mr. Miyagi fixed it.

31:22.520 --> 31:23.920
Great, thank you.

31:24.920 --> 31:27.080
- How much do we owe you?
- No, please.

31:27.320 --> 31:28.440
My pleasure.

31:28.800 --> 31:30.200
That's very nice.

31:32.560 --> 31:33.760
Hi, champ.

31:34.280 --> 31:35.240
Hey.

31:36.360 --> 31:40.240
- What are you doing?
- I'm trimming my baby tree.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.080
<i>Bonsai tree.</i>

31:42.680 --> 31:43.760
<i>Bonsai tree.</i>

31:44.120 --> 31:45.080
<i>Bonsai.</i>

31:45.720 --> 31:46.680
<i>Bonsai.</i>

31:47.680 --> 31:48.720
They're beautiful.

31:48.840 --> 31:51.560
Mr. Miyagi learned it in Okinawa.
That's where he's from.

31:51.760 --> 31:52.720
Really?

31:52.840 --> 31:54.320
They're so delicate.

31:59.240 --> 32:00.400
For me?

32:00.920 --> 32:02.560
No, I couldn't.

32:02.640 --> 32:04.760
Please, hurt feelings.

32:06.120 --> 32:07.920
That's very nice, thank you.

32:08.480 --> 32:10.720
- Welcome.
- I know just where it will go.

32:11.680 --> 32:13.240
Come on, it's getting late.

32:13.400 --> 32:16.440
- I'll be up in a half hour.
- No, now. School tomorrow.

32:17.560 --> 32:20.200
- Thank you for everything.
- You're welcome.

32:22.120 --> 32:23.760
Don't forget tree.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.320
Must practice.

32:27.280 --> 32:28.320
Thank you.

32:28.440 --> 32:30.480
<i>- Sayonara.
- Sayonara.</i>

32:31.320 --> 32:33.680
- Goodnight.
- Thanks again. See you.

32:37.200 --> 32:40.080
Ma, he gave you the nicest one.
This guy is something else.

32:40.320 --> 32:43.200
You saw what he did to my bike.
This guy is great.

33:12.600 --> 33:16.560
- Happy Halloween. You like?
- Yeah, that's nice.

33:16.760 --> 33:19.400
Passed school today. Lots happening.

33:21.280 --> 33:23.360
What's the matter? You're not going?

33:23.520 --> 33:24.480
No.

33:25.080 --> 33:26.040
How come?

33:26.680 --> 33:28.680
I'm not into dancing that much.

33:30.160 --> 33:31.800
I don't feel like it, anyway.

33:33.800 --> 33:36.360
You're too much by self. Not good.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.520
I'm not by myself.

33:39.320 --> 33:40.520
I'm with you.

33:41.440 --> 33:45.920
To make honey, young bee
need young flower, not old prune.

33:46.840 --> 33:48.800
I don't have a costume, anyway.

33:49.520 --> 33:51.000
If have costume...

33:51.560 --> 33:52.600
...you go?

33:53.240 --> 33:55.280
If I went as the Invisible Man.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.640
Invisible Man?

33:59.040 --> 34:01.120
You know, so no one would see me.

34:17.239 --> 34:18.560
There's Daniel.

34:18.719 --> 34:20.360
- Where?
- In the shower.

34:20.440 --> 34:22.800
- How do you know?
- I just know.

34:22.920 --> 34:24.040
May I?

34:25.120 --> 34:28.800
- I don't know what she sees in him.
- She must be into fungus.

34:33.360 --> 34:35.920
Help me, my flower needs water.

34:37.320 --> 34:39.880
You've come to the right place, stranger.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.600
- I've never danced in a shower.
- A friend of mine made this for me.

34:45.120 --> 34:46.080
Isn't it great?

34:46.280 --> 34:47.920
Where have you been hiding?

34:48.320 --> 34:49.880
I haven't been hiding.

34:49.960 --> 34:52.920
- I haven't seen you around.
- You been looking?

34:53.199 --> 34:54.840
- Sort of.
- Sort of?

34:55.360 --> 34:57.480
I thought you were still angry with me.

34:58.160 --> 35:01.040
- Why?
- Because of what I said last time I saw you.

35:01.160 --> 35:03.040
I've been thinking a lot about that.

35:03.160 --> 35:05.640
I should learn to mind my own business.

35:06.120 --> 35:09.800
No, I think you're right about facing things.
I feel the same way.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.360
I just kind of forgot for a while.

35:12.520 --> 35:15.400
- Thanks for reminding me.
- You're welcome.

35:17.160 --> 35:20.040
He thinks he can do
whatever he wants to people.

35:20.680 --> 35:22.320
- Who?
- Johnny.

35:22.680 --> 35:24.920
I'd love to see him get some
of his own medicine.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.000
What goes around comes around.

35:27.200 --> 35:30.080
- I'd love to be there when it does.
- Me, too.

35:36.240 --> 35:38.040
You want to go outside?

35:39.920 --> 35:41.320
You talked me into it.

35:46.520 --> 35:50.720
- That chicken is wild!
- That guy's using real eggs!

35:50.840 --> 35:52.240
He's great!

35:52.600 --> 35:53.720
No!

36:00.440 --> 36:01.600
Johnny!

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
Johnny!

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
- Got that number rolled?
- In a minute.

36:13.120 --> 36:15.400
I'm going to get the guys. Hurry up.

37:10.760 --> 37:11.960
Shit!

37:12.680 --> 37:14.320
Move, man!

37:19.400 --> 37:21.200
Johnny, what's up?

37:23.240 --> 37:25.800
Get out of my way!

37:26.240 --> 37:28.560
- What's wrong?
- It's coming around.

37:34.920 --> 37:35.840
Get up!

37:38.480 --> 37:39.560
Get out of my way!

37:47.320 --> 37:49.360
What the hell are you doing?

37:50.120 --> 37:51.520
Get out of the way!

38:25.600 --> 38:27.160
You ain't going nowhere.

38:32.200 --> 38:33.920
You little wimp!

38:36.520 --> 38:39.560
You couldn't leave well enough alone,
could you, little twerp?

38:39.720 --> 38:42.600
No, you had to push it.
Well, now you're gonna pay!

38:45.280 --> 38:47.320
Where are you going, sweetheart?

38:47.600 --> 38:49.640
How about a front kick, Johnny?

38:54.000 --> 38:55.040
Get him up.

38:55.160 --> 38:57.160
- He's had enough.
- Shut up!

38:57.280 --> 39:00.960
- He can't even stand up.
- That don't mean squat.

39:01.400 --> 39:05.280
- Johnny, he's had enough.
- I'll decide when he's had enough.

39:05.360 --> 39:07.160
What's wrong with you, Johnny?

39:07.280 --> 39:10.240
- An enemy deserves no mercy.
- Right!

39:10.800 --> 39:12.360
You're crazy, man!

39:17.280 --> 39:18.840
Get him!

39:47.120 --> 39:48.360
<i>Daniel-san.</i>

39:49.840 --> 39:50.840
Come.

40:31.680 --> 40:32.800
Leave on.

40:33.560 --> 40:36.520
- It stinks. What is it?
- Smell bad, heal good.

40:41.080 --> 40:43.240
- Where did Spider-Man go?
- Who?

40:43.840 --> 40:46.040
The guy who bailed me out.
Where'd he go?

40:49.960 --> 40:50.960
What, you?

40:53.240 --> 40:55.600
- No way.
- Why "no way"?

40:55.720 --> 40:58.760
- Because...
- Because, old man?

41:00.000 --> 41:01.080
Have tea.

41:01.680 --> 41:02.760
Feel better.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.400
Why didn't you tell me?

41:29.560 --> 41:31.760
- Tell you what?
- That you do karate.

41:32.600 --> 41:34.840
- You never ask.
- Where'd you learn it?

41:35.440 --> 41:36.400
Father.

41:36.960 --> 41:38.880
I thought he was a fisherman.

41:39.880 --> 41:42.520
In Okinawa, all Miyagi know two things:

41:43.040 --> 41:44.920
Fish and karate.

41:45.360 --> 41:48.080
Karate come from China, 16th century.

41:48.760 --> 41:50.680
<i>Called "te," hand.</i>

41:51.480 --> 41:52.800
Much later...

41:53.400 --> 41:58.320
...Miyagi ancestors call "karate,"
empty hand.

41:59.760 --> 42:02.640
I always thought it came
from Buddhist temples.

42:03.440 --> 42:05.400
You, too much TV.

42:06.400 --> 42:08.360
That's what my mother tells me.

42:12.440 --> 42:15.240
- Have you ever taught anyone?
- No.

42:15.320 --> 42:16.320
Would you?

42:17.080 --> 42:18.880
- It depend.
- On what?

42:19.360 --> 42:20.320
Reason.

42:21.400 --> 42:22.720
How's revenge?

42:24.880 --> 42:29.240
You look for revenge that way,
start by digging two graves.

42:30.240 --> 42:32.400
At least I'd have company, right?

42:32.600 --> 42:35.800
Fighting always last answer to problem.

42:36.760 --> 42:39.640
Mr. Miyagi, I don't think
you understand my problem.

42:39.760 --> 42:42.800
Miyagi understand problem perfect.

42:43.920 --> 42:47.680
Your friend all karate student?

42:48.440 --> 42:50.440
Friends? Yeah, those guys.

42:50.560 --> 42:52.040
Problem attitude.

42:52.600 --> 42:56.080
The problem is I keep getting
my ass kicked.

42:56.320 --> 42:59.880
Because boys have bad attitude.

43:00.840 --> 43:03.080
Karate for defence only.

43:04.280 --> 43:06.480
That's not what these guys are taught.

43:07.040 --> 43:08.520
I can see.

43:09.240 --> 43:12.760
No such thing bad student,
only bad teacher.

43:13.280 --> 43:15.440
Teacher say, student do.

43:16.680 --> 43:18.240
Great, that solves everything.

43:18.320 --> 43:22.280
I'll go to the school and straighten it out
with the teacher.

43:22.760 --> 43:26.040
Now use head
for something other than target.

43:27.360 --> 43:30.240
- I was only kidding.
- Why kidding?

43:30.800 --> 43:32.840
I get killed if I show up there.

43:33.760 --> 43:35.240
Get killed anyway.

43:40.800 --> 43:42.280
Would you go with me?

43:43.880 --> 43:45.040
No, I can't.

43:45.640 --> 43:47.360
Why? You said it was a good idea.

43:47.480 --> 43:49.200
For you, good idea.

43:49.280 --> 43:52.080
For me, good idea no get involved.

43:52.200 --> 43:54.520
But you're already involved.

43:54.680 --> 43:56.080
- Very sorry.
- What?

44:01.920 --> 44:03.840
Thanks for nothing then.

44:04.320 --> 44:07.040
Like I didn't have enough problems already.

44:08.520 --> 44:11.880
Now I've got to carry your weight, too.
Don't do me any more favours.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.240
<i>- Daniel-san.
- What?</i>

44:17.760 --> 44:19.920
Okay, I go.

44:22.120 --> 44:25.080
- Excellent, Mr. Miyagi.
- Miyagi.

44:26.200 --> 44:27.240
Miyagi.

44:27.600 --> 44:29.400
What kind of belt do you have?

44:30.160 --> 44:31.160
Canvas.

44:31.440 --> 44:32.480
You like?

44:33.080 --> 44:34.960
J.C. Penney. $3.98.

44:35.640 --> 44:36.640
I meant...

44:36.800 --> 44:39.920
In Okinawa a belt means
no need rope hold up pants.

44:42.680 --> 44:44.400
That's funny.

44:44.560 --> 44:46.120
<i>- Daniel-san.
- What?</i>

44:47.880 --> 44:50.200
Karate here.

44:51.960 --> 44:53.600
Karate here.

44:54.360 --> 44:56.640
Karate never here.

44:58.200 --> 44:59.520
You understand?

45:01.440 --> 45:02.480
I think so.

45:04.600 --> 45:06.240
<i>Goodnight, Daniel-san.</i>

45:07.400 --> 45:09.720
Goodnight, Mr. Miyagi. Miyagi!

45:10.800 --> 45:12.200
Tomorrow morning?

45:12.560 --> 45:14.120
10:00.

45:19.840 --> 45:23.600
Thanks for helping me out
with my friends out there.

45:36.560 --> 45:40.760
- Good morning, Mr. Miyagi.
- How do you feel?

45:40.880 --> 45:45.000
- A little sore.
- You know how drive?

45:45.120 --> 45:47.080
Yeah, I do.

45:48.120 --> 45:52.080
- No, I'm not very good at it.
- Me neither.

45:52.200 --> 45:54.080
I don't have a licence.

45:54.400 --> 45:55.600
Me neither.

45:56.400 --> 45:59.120
I guess it's okay then.

46:35.120 --> 46:37.680
You lose concentration
in a fight and you're dead meat!

46:37.800 --> 46:38.880
<i>- Yes, Sensei.
- What?</i>

46:39.000 --> 46:40.080
<i>Yes, Sensei!</i>

46:41.640 --> 46:42.720
Get up!

46:44.600 --> 46:47.160
Give me 60 pushups on your knuckles.

46:51.120 --> 46:52.280
Combat!

47:02.040 --> 47:03.920
Brown. Robertson.

47:14.480 --> 47:15.560
On guard.

47:21.040 --> 47:22.520
Point. Round kick.

47:22.840 --> 47:24.920
What are you looking at? Finish him!

47:26.800 --> 47:28.120
Return.

47:30.960 --> 47:32.360
Prepare.

47:35.640 --> 47:38.760
We do not train to be merciful, here.
Mercy is for the weak.

47:39.600 --> 47:42.320
Here, on the street, in competition...

47:42.440 --> 47:44.320
...a man confronts you, he is the enemy.

47:44.440 --> 47:48.040
An enemy deserves no mercy.
What is the problem, Mr. Lawrence?

47:51.400 --> 47:53.040
Come on, let's forget this.

47:53.760 --> 47:55.560
Wait, not yet.

47:57.640 --> 48:00.280
Class, we have visitors. Fall in behind me.

48:07.680 --> 48:10.120
I hear you jumped
some of my students last night.

48:10.720 --> 48:12.840
Afraid the facts mixed up.

48:13.560 --> 48:15.040
Are you calling him a liar?

48:15.520 --> 48:17.240
No call no one nothing.

48:17.520 --> 48:19.440
What are you here for, old man?

48:19.560 --> 48:21.680
Come ask leave boy alone.

48:22.600 --> 48:24.920
Can't the boy take care of himself?

48:25.080 --> 48:26.720
One-to-one problem, yes.

48:27.320 --> 48:30.440
Five-to-one problem, too much ask anyone.

48:30.560 --> 48:32.800
Is that what's bothering you, the odds?

48:33.280 --> 48:35.000
Well, we can fix that.

48:35.400 --> 48:37.680
<i>- Feel like matching, Mr. Lawrence?
- Yes, Sensei!</i>

48:37.840 --> 48:39.000
No more fighting.

48:39.120 --> 48:41.400
<i>This is a karate dojo, not a knitting class.</i>

48:41.560 --> 48:44.600
You don't come in here,
drop a challenge and leave, old man.

48:45.400 --> 48:48.280
You get your boy on the mat,
or you and I will have a problem.

48:48.400 --> 48:51.520
<i>Too much advantage, your dojo.</i>

48:52.480 --> 48:53.880
Name a place.

48:54.560 --> 48:55.760
Tournament.

49:00.160 --> 49:02.960
You've got real nerve, old man.

49:04.320 --> 49:06.280
But I think we can accommodate you.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.720
Can't we, Mr. Lawrence?

49:08.920 --> 49:10.320
<i>Yes, Sensei.</i>

49:11.080 --> 49:12.080
Fall in.

49:16.600 --> 49:18.880
Ask one more small request.

49:19.600 --> 49:20.920
Make it fast.

49:21.280 --> 49:24.160
Ask leave boy alone to train.

49:25.320 --> 49:27.640
You're a pushy little bastard, ain't you?

49:27.760 --> 49:29.640
But I like that.

49:33.400 --> 49:36.360
No one touches the prima donna
until the tournament.

49:36.480 --> 49:39.680
<i>- Is that understood?
- Yes, Sensei!</i>

49:41.440 --> 49:42.920
But if you don't show...

49:44.400 --> 49:45.880
...then it's open season...

49:47.880 --> 49:49.080
...on him...

49:50.800 --> 49:52.000
...and you.

50:17.560 --> 50:19.040
I can't believe this.

50:19.680 --> 50:21.560
- I cannot believe this!
- What?

50:21.640 --> 50:24.840
What you just got me into.
You said you'd make things better.

50:24.960 --> 50:27.000
- I did.
- How?

50:27.320 --> 50:30.760
How? I saved you two months of beating.

50:31.480 --> 50:34.360
Great, now I've got something
to look forward to.

50:39.120 --> 50:41.160
How much further is your house?

50:42.000 --> 50:43.640
Other side tracks.

50:43.880 --> 50:46.000
Are you in the oil business, too?

50:46.920 --> 50:49.480
Not everything is as seem.

50:49.600 --> 50:52.040
Reminds me of Newark.
What are we going to do here?

50:52.160 --> 50:53.560
Start training.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.480
Much work be done.

50:55.680 --> 50:57.720
Tournament here before you know it.

50:58.160 --> 50:59.800
That's what I'm afraid of.

51:04.040 --> 51:07.720
That teacher was really wacko.
You really think I can beat that guy?

51:07.840 --> 51:09.240
No matter.

51:09.920 --> 51:12.640
Wacko teacher attitude rest in fist.

51:12.800 --> 51:14.600
Stupid, but fact of life.

51:14.720 --> 51:16.440
Win, lose, no matter.

51:16.760 --> 51:19.320
You make good fight, earn respect.

51:19.600 --> 51:23.160
- Then nobody bother.
- They'll bury me where I fall.

51:23.960 --> 51:28.000
Either way, problem solved.
Wait right here.

51:36.680 --> 51:37.920
This is great.

51:45.280 --> 51:49.000
- I forgot to give you this back.
- You keep.

51:49.120 --> 51:50.280
Thanks a lot.

51:51.080 --> 51:53.880
- Ready?
- Yeah, I guess so.

51:56.760 --> 51:58.680
<i>Daniel-san, must talk.</i>

52:00.920 --> 52:02.560
Walk on road.

52:03.000 --> 52:07.280
Walk right side, safe. Walk left side, safe.

52:07.800 --> 52:13.000
Walk middle, sooner or later,
you get squished just like grape.

52:13.680 --> 52:15.640
Here, karate same thing.

52:15.760 --> 52:20.280
Either you karate do, yes, or karate do, no.

52:20.640 --> 52:24.920
You karate do, "guess so," just like grape.

52:26.040 --> 52:27.600
Understand?

52:28.720 --> 52:30.360
Yeah, I understand.

52:31.320 --> 52:32.800
Ready?

52:33.880 --> 52:35.120
Yeah, I'm ready.

52:35.320 --> 52:36.640
Yes.

52:38.880 --> 52:41.200
First make sacred pact.

52:42.440 --> 52:46.960
I promise teach karate. That's my part.

52:47.280 --> 52:54.200
You promise learn. I say, you do,
no questions. That's your part.

52:55.640 --> 52:56.760
Deal?

52:57.400 --> 52:58.880
It's a deal.

53:03.560 --> 53:07.080
First wash all the cars, then wax.

53:07.640 --> 53:11.920
- Why do I have to...
- Remember deal. No questions.

53:12.160 --> 53:14.040
Yeah, but...

53:14.920 --> 53:19.640
Wax on right hand. Wax off left hand.

53:20.040 --> 53:22.760
Wax on, wax off.

53:23.080 --> 53:26.440
Breathe in through nose,
out through mouth.

53:27.640 --> 53:30.120
Wax on, wax off.

53:30.240 --> 53:32.800
Don't forget to breathe. Very important.

53:33.080 --> 53:35.720
Wax on, wax off.

53:36.040 --> 53:38.200
Wax on, wax off.

53:38.320 --> 53:39.960
Where did these cars come from?

53:41.120 --> 53:42.440
Detroit.

54:00.360 --> 54:01.760
Wax on...

54:02.520 --> 54:04.400
...right hand make circle.

54:04.480 --> 54:07.120
Wax off, left hand make circle.

54:07.440 --> 54:10.320
Wax on, wax off.

54:10.600 --> 54:13.560
Breathe in, breathe out.

54:13.840 --> 54:16.720
Wax on, wax off.

54:48.400 --> 54:50.840
Mr. Miyagi, I'm finished.

54:52.040 --> 54:53.680
You want to check these out?

54:55.000 --> 54:56.200
Mr. Miyagi?

54:58.400 --> 54:59.400
Mr. Miyagi?

55:06.280 --> 55:07.440
Hello?

55:42.880 --> 55:45.440
I've been looking all over for you.
Where've you been?

55:45.600 --> 55:47.720
- I don't believe it.
- What?

55:47.960 --> 55:51.080
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to find that idiot.

55:51.160 --> 55:53.720
- No, it's been taken care of.
- Until next time.

55:53.880 --> 55:56.600
- There isn't going to be a "next time."
- There they are.

55:57.240 --> 56:00.640
Watch this.
Hey, guys, it's good to see you.

56:01.200 --> 56:03.760
Sorry about your eye, Johnny.
Your shoulder okay, Tommy?

56:04.000 --> 56:06.800
You guys be careful not to step
in front of any more buses.

56:07.720 --> 56:11.000
<i>Hold it. Remember what Sensei said?
Wait for the tournament.</i>

56:11.120 --> 56:13.360
It must be "Take a Worm for a Walk" week.

56:15.920 --> 56:17.400
You did all that damage?

56:17.480 --> 56:20.120
When you make a wish in the shower,
it always comes true.

56:20.200 --> 56:23.240
- I should have kept my mouth shut.
- No, we've got an agreement.

56:23.320 --> 56:24.880
Yeah? What's that?

56:25.000 --> 56:29.480
They agreed not to beat up on me
and I promised not to bleed on them.

56:30.360 --> 56:32.920
- I don't believe you.
- What can I do, moan and groan?

56:33.000 --> 56:36.240
- Anybody else would.
- Who'd listen anyway?

56:36.400 --> 56:37.400
Me.

56:38.560 --> 56:39.880
Really?

56:40.920 --> 56:44.800
- You feel like listening on Saturday night?
- Sure.

56:45.160 --> 56:47.080
Great! So Saturday night...

56:47.200 --> 56:50.520
...we'll go out, we'll have a good time.
We'll do whatever.

56:51.760 --> 56:54.400
- Is that your address?
- You got it.

56:55.320 --> 56:56.720
Where is this?

56:57.560 --> 56:59.280
- I've got to go.
- Okay.

56:59.360 --> 57:02.240
I'll talk to you later. Great.

57:03.080 --> 57:04.200
All right.

57:07.640 --> 57:11.920
Mr. Harris, can I talk to you?
LaRusso. Third period history class.

57:12.040 --> 57:17.080
I wanted to tell you, I really got a lot
out of that lecture about the Indians.

57:17.520 --> 57:22.320
I was telling my buddies about it.
Could you give us a quick review?

57:22.440 --> 57:24.880
- Sure, I'm free this period.
- Great for me.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.400
No, I got to go.

57:27.840 --> 57:31.120
I guess that leaves you and me,
but that's all right.

57:31.240 --> 57:33.560
You can tell them about it later.

57:33.680 --> 57:37.720
The Plains Indians
were a very primitive tribe...

57:51.080 --> 57:52.480
Come on, Casanova.

58:18.920 --> 58:21.200
- Hi, how are you doing?
- Good.

58:21.320 --> 58:23.520
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

58:23.720 --> 58:25.360
You've got company.

58:25.480 --> 58:28.760
Those are my parents.
Come on, I want you to meet them.

58:28.880 --> 58:30.280
Great.

58:30.880 --> 58:32.600
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi, Dad.

58:32.680 --> 58:34.960
This is Daniel LaRusso.

58:35.080 --> 58:37.960
- My parents, Mr. And Mrs. Mills.
- How do you do, Daniel?

58:38.960 --> 58:41.000
- Hello, Daniel.
- Nice to meet you.

58:41.120 --> 58:44.000
- Where are you going?
- I don't know. Where are we going?

58:44.120 --> 58:45.840
I don't know. Wherever you want.

58:45.920 --> 58:49.040
- Golf N' Stuff?
- We're going to Golf N' Stuff, then.

58:50.040 --> 58:52.840
Don't worry about that.
Weren't you going to have that fixed?

58:52.920 --> 58:54.800
I am. I was. I will.

58:54.920 --> 58:58.640
- You live in Encino, Daniel?
- Encino? No.

58:59.280 --> 59:03.160
- Where do you live?
- Out, like Reseda.

59:04.840 --> 59:08.280
- And that's your mother?
- Yeah, that's her.

59:08.400 --> 59:09.600
Hi!

59:10.000 --> 59:12.720
She's waiting for us.
We'd better go. Nice to meet you.

59:12.840 --> 59:15.400
- Not too late, sweetheart.
- Okay, Dad.

59:19.920 --> 59:24.280
- Hi, Mrs. LaRusso. I'm Ali.
- Hi, Ali. Call me Lucille.

59:25.200 --> 59:28.000
- That's a beautiful house you have.
- Thanks.

59:35.120 --> 59:36.600
- Can you drive a stick?
- Yeah.

59:37.280 --> 59:41.000
Put it into second, let it roll,
and when I say "pop it," pop it.

59:41.160 --> 59:42.160
"Pop it."

59:47.360 --> 59:49.560
Don't worry, it's all under control.

59:50.280 --> 59:53.160
She's cute. It happens a lot.

59:53.520 --> 59:57.560
Okay, LaRusso, push! On, you huskies!

59:57.680 --> 59:59.800
Okay, pop it!

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:02.760
We got it on the first!

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:24.360
I'll pick you up at 11:00.
Please, don't be late. Have fun.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:31.880
- Look at that slide.
- We'll do that next time.

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:35.680
- Why next time?
- You need a bathing suit.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:38.960
Oh, yeah. Bathing suits.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:43.000
- Do you play hockey?
- Not professionally.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.560
This is the best time
I've had since I've been here.

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:49.480
- We'll have to do it again.
- Definitely.

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.760
Hey, good looking. How are you?

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.320
Good. This is cool.

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:56.320
- I just got it. You want a ride?
- Some other time.

01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:59.440
- Are you sure?
- Daniel, this is Eddie. Eddie, Daniel.

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:01.280
- How are you doing, Daniel?
- Good.

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.440
- Hey, Ali! How's it going?
- Hi, guys.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:07.560
- How are you doing?
- Want to come with us?

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:11.000
No, I don't think so.
You guys have a good time.

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:13.320
- We'll make room.
- I'll call you tomorrow.

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.960
Your little friend can come,
if it's okay with his mommy.

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.280
Hi, kids.

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:22.320
- Hey, Mommy, can Daniel come for a ride?
- I really like your car.

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:33.720
- You could've gone.
- I didn't want to.

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:38.560
- It's no big deal.
- Lf I'd wanted to go, I would have.

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:42.640
It makes no difference to me.
Do what you want, I don't care.

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:15.240
This is beautiful.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.840
Mr. Miyagi, this is great.
You've got real fish in there.

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.960
This is outrageous.

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:32.920
I thought Chung Lee's restaurant was nice.
You beat his act.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.720
This is paradise. Did you do this yourself?

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:38.680
Are these bongos?

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:40.800
No, I got it.

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:44.320
<i>"Hare Krishna"</i>

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.400
<i>Daniel-san, you much humour.</i>

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:49.040
- What are these?
- Japanese sander.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:52.400
- What do you do with them?
- Funny you should ask.

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.720
Right circle.

01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:59.560
Left circle.

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:04.480
- It'd be easier going back and forth.
- But you go circle.

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:06.080
Right circle.

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.120
Left circle.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:13.120
Right circle, left circle.

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:16.160
Breathe in, breathe out.

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:19.960
Right circle, left circle.

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.720
Right circle, left circle.

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:25.120
Breathe in, breathe out.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:32.440
Whole floor. Right circle, left circle.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.640
Right circle.

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:36.920
Left circle.

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:40.440
Breathe in, breathe out.

01:04:58.480 --> 01:04:59.880
Very good.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.600
Splinters all gone.

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:08.120
I'm finished.

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:10.960
Mr. Miyagi, I'm beat.

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:13.200
My shoulders.

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:14.560
Good.

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:17.240
Go home, get rest.

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:21.320
Come morning, start early. 6:00.

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:10.880
Wouldn't a fly swatter be easier?

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:16.520
Man who catch fly with chopsticks,
accomplish anything.

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:20.040
Did you ever catch one?

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.800
Not yet.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:25.880
Could I try?

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:28.560
If wish.

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:55.560
Hey, Mr. Miyagi, look!

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:04.600
You, beginner luck.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:11.120
I guess that means I can accomplish
anything, right? No sweat.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:14.880
First you accomplish paint fence.

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:27.840
All in wrist.

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:32.160
Wrist up. Wrist down.

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:38.120
All in wrist. Up, down, long stroke.

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:41.200
Very good. Up, down.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.640
No look me, look fence.

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:45.720
Up...

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:47.840
...down.

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:52.720
Bend the wrist. Downstroke, you bend.
See? Good.

01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:56.280
Long stroke. Up, down. Very good.

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:58.600
Bend your knees. Down.

01:07:58.760 --> 01:07:59.760
Up.

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.760
<i>Very good, Daniel-san.
Don't forget to breathe.</i>

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.640
In, out.

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:06.680
Up...

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:08.880
...down.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:13.120
Up, down.

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.480
Up...

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:16.240
...down.

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:17.920
Up...

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:19.520
...down.

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:25.800
<i>Very good, Daniel-san.</i>

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.120
Up, down.

01:08:29.399 --> 01:08:30.720
Up...

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.319
...down.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:41.800
Small board, left hand.
Big board, right hand.

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:45.399
- I'm almost done.
- All of fence.

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:53.960
Big board, right hand.
Small board, left hand.

01:08:54.399 --> 01:08:56.279
Up, down.

01:08:57.279 --> 01:08:59.240
Up, down.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.120
All finished.

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:21.120
It looks pretty good, huh?

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:23.240
Both sides?

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.319
Not yet.

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:47.319
<i>Daniel-san. Very good job.</i>

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.800
Come morning. Start early.

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:04.760
Up...

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:06.560
...down.

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:08.400
Up...

01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:10.000
...down.

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:40.600
Damn it! I can't believe this.

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:01.840
Missed spot.

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:03.440
What spot?

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:07.360
- You didn't tell me you were going fishing.
- You not here when I go.

01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:11.000
- Maybe I wanted to go.
- You karate training.

01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:13.800
I'm what? I'm being your goddamn slave!

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:15.840
- We made a deal here.
- So?

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:18.720
"So"? You're supposed to teach
and I'm supposed to learn.

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:21.920
Four days I've been busting my ass,
I haven't learned a thing.

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:25.160
- You learn plenty.
- I've learned to sand your decks.

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:28.440
I've waxed your car, I paint your house,
paint your fence.

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:32.280
- Not everything is as seems.
- Bullshit! I'm going home, man.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.880
<i>Daniel-san!</i>

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.680
- What?
- Come here.

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:47.000
- Show me sand the floor.
- I can't move my arm, all right?

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:53.280
What are you doing?

01:11:58.760 --> 01:11:59.960
What are you doing?

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:05.920
- Now show me sand the floor.
- How did you do that?

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:07.160
Show!

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:11.760
Sand the floor?

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:16.360
Stand up.

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:20.880
Show me sand the floor.

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:25.440
Sand the floor.

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.400
Sand the floor.

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:30.080
Big circle. Sand the floor.

01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:32.520
Sand the floor.

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:38.200
Now show me wax on, wax off.

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:48.760
- Wax on, wax off.
- "Wax on, wax off!"

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:49.920
Wax on...

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:51.560
...wax off.

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.760
Concentrate. Look in my eyes.

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:57.240
Lock your hand, thumb inside.

01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:59.200
Wax on...

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.160
...wax off.

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:02.680
Wax on...

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:05.120
...wax off.

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:07.640
Wax on.

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:09.960
Wax off.

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:15.480
Show me paint the fence. Up, down.

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:18.880

Look eye! Always look eye.

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.840
Come back tomorrow.

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:18.080
Learn balance. Go water, kick.
Learn balance.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.320
What were you doing on those stumps?

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:02.520
- Called crane technique.
- Does it work?

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.400
If do right, no can defence.

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:07.200
Could you teach me?

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:10.240
First learn stand, then learn fly.

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:14.520
<i>- Nature rule, Daniel-san, not mine.
- Who taught you?</i>

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:18.200
- Father teach.
- You must have had some father.

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:23.400
- Look, the kid's got a pet Nip.
- He know any tricks, kid?

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:28.160
Excuse, please. Boy cold, must leave.

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:30.760
Kindly remove bottle.

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:36.840
Kindly do it yourself, Mr. Moto.

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:49.200
How did you do that?

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:52.120
Don't know. First time.

01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:58.360
Hey, you!

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:11.200
- Hey, not bad. Definitely varsity material.
- You let me.

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:17.120
Should we try the slide on Friday?
I could pick you up about 7:00.

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:20.200
I'm having dinner with my parents
at the country club.

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:22.920
I'll be done by 9:30. Meet me out front.

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:24.360
- Is that cool?
- Yeah.

01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:25.800
Johnny, over here!

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:29.680
- What's the matter?
- It's that little voice again.

01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:33.240
Pretend you're deaf.
Encino Oaks Country Club. 9:30.

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:35.880
Friday? Great.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.320
- Hi, Ali.
- "Hi, Ali."

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:40.400
I've got to be nuts.

01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:56.680
Okay, here. Stop. Throw anchor.

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:04.960
Good. Stand bow.

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:09.400
Not bow. Bow!

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:12.640
- Up!
- What, up front?

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:14.280
Make block.

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:17.360
Left, right. Up, down.

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:21.200
Side, side. Breathe in, breathe out.

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:24.400
And no scare fish.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.040
When do I learn how to punch?

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:33.640
Better learn balance.

01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:35.800
Balance is key.

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:39.920
Balance good, karate good.
Everything good.

01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:44.400
Balance bad, better pack up, go home.
Understand?

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:47.120
Yeah, I understand.

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:54.200
Did you ever get into fights
when you were a kid?

01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:55.760
Plenty.

01:19:56.280 --> 01:20:00.880
- It wasn't like the problem I have, right?
- Fighting, fighting. Same, same.

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:02.840
But you knew karate.

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:06.080
Someone always know more.

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:09.200
There were times
when you were scared to fight?

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:13.840
Always scared. Miyagi hate fighting.

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:17.440
- But you like karate.
- So?

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:20.400
Karate's fighting, you train to fight.

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.960
That what you think?

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.080
No.

01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:30.640
Then why train?

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:34.560
So I won't have to fight.

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:38.200
Miyagi have hope for you.

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:41.880
- When do I learn how to punch?
- Learn how punch...

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:44.880
...when learn how keep dry!
- No!

01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:52.000
<i>Daniel-san, you're all wet behind ear!</i>

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:53.760
Are you crazy?

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:56.360
You're crazy.

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:18.640
Trouble with Johnny?

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:22.520
- You two lovebirds having problems?
- We're not lovebirds.

01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:26.440
- What time is it?
- It's about 9:40.

01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:30.360
- I've got to go.
- Do you have a date?

01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:35.520
- With whom?
- A friend.

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:37.760
Not that boy from Reseda.

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:39.840
Yeah, he's from Reseda.

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:42.200
He's a nice guy. It's no big deal.

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:45.800
Honey, you've monopolised
the best-looking man here long enough.

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:48.400
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:53.760
I've been thinking,
maybe we can call a truce.

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:57.200
I'm not at war. Excuse me.

01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:59.360
Could we please finish the dance?

01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:02.440
Don't you ever do that to me again!

01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:55.720
I didn't know you were a singer.
How are you doing?

01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:00.720
<i>Daniel-san, come inside.</i>

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:04.560
- What's that song you were singing?
- Japanese blues.

01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:07.520
<i>Kampai.</i>

01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:10.240
<i>Kampai.</i>

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:19.560
<i>Banzai!</i>

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:22.080
To baby trees.

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:26.600
<i>Not bonsai. Banzai!</i>

01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:28.640
<i>Banzai.</i>

01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:31.440
<i>Banzai!</i>

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:34.520
<i>- Banzai!
- Close enough.</i>

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:50.600
- What are we celebrating here?
- Anniversary.

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:53.440
Whose anniversary?

01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:58.200
Is this your wife?
I didn't know you were married.

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:03.520
- Damn beautiful, don't you think?
- Yeah, she's pretty.

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:07.680
First time I saw her...

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:11.360
...was cane field, Hawaii.

01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:14.040
Beautiful.

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:18.040
Damn good cane cutter, too.

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:22.600
Where is she now?

01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:25.440
Drink, drink.

01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:36.120
<i>Daniel-san.</i>

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:39.720
Look, look.

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:48.880
First American-born Miyagi
waiting to be born.

01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:57.320
Drink, drink.

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.000
"Sergeant Miyagi!

01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:04.520

"...wife have complications at birth."

01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:29.080
Complications. No doctor came.

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:34.080
Land of free, home of brave.

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:36.040
No doctor came.

01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:54.040
Mr. Miyagi.

01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:58.920
Are you okay?

01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:49.640
"We regret to inform you
that on November 2, 1944...

"Valour."

Now punch.

01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:37.200
Hard.

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:42.200
You some kind of girl or something?

01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:46.440
Punch! Drive a punch.
Not just arm. Whole body.

<i>Hip, leg, drive a punch. Make kiai.</i>

01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:53.880

Hey, pretty good?

01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:09.160
Look at this.

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:14.000
<i>Wait. Daniel-san.</i>

01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:18.560
What do you think?

01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:24.320
I tell you what Miyagi think,
I think you dance around too much.

01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:27.800
I think you talk too much.
I think you no concentrate enough.

01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:30.600
Lots of work to be done.
Tournament just around corner.

01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:32.160
Come, stand up.

01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:36.280
Steady, concentrate. Focus power.

01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:43.080
Drive a punch.

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:46.040
<i>Drive a punch, Daniel-san.</i>

I know what I'm wishing for.

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:20.160
Very good.

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:27.760
Number one birthday present.

01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:31.360
Mr. Miyagi, what did you do?
You didn't have to do this.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.400
What is this? I have no idea.

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:40.680
Mr. Miyagi, this is great.

01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:44.480
Where did this come from?

01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:49.320

I'll understand.

01:32:56.960 --> 01:32:58.920
I know you understand.

01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:01.800
Try on.

01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:05.680
This is beautiful. This is great.

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:08.840
Do you think I stand a chance
at the tournament?

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:12.280
Not matter what Miyagi think.
Miyagi not fighting.

01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:15.760
I don't know if I know enough karate.

01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:18.080
Feeling correct.

01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:21.560
You sure know how to make
a guy feel confident.

01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:27.600
You trust the quality of what you know,
not quantity.

01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:32.160
Today you get driver's licence?

01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:35.360
Yeah, look at this.

01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:38.160

Thanks. The kid's legal, now.

01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:49.640
I never know you have sweetheart.

01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:57.360
No. Different, but different.

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:01.520
Too bad mother not here.

01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:02.920
Shoot!

01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:05.120
- Shoot! Damn!
- What's matter?

01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:09.520
I've got to go. My mother
is making a surprise cake for me.

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:12.640
- Miyagi understand.
- I wasn't supposed to know. Damn it.

01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:14.280
- That's okay.
- I'm sorry.

01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:16.200
Miyagi once have mother, too.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.040
Go outside. Something show you.

01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:22.920
Number two present?

01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:27.320
You don't have to give me anything.
You've given me enough already.

01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:29.760
No really, I'm serious.

01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:32.440
Choose.

01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:37.440
Oh, no.

01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:40.680
Hurt old man feeling.

01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:44.720
- Choose.
- Oh, wow.

01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:57.280
I can't believe it.

01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:02.840
What a gift!

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.720
Oh, boy.

01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:18.600
Just remember:

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:24.320
A licence never replace eye, ear and brain.

01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:30.640
What matter?

01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:35.000
I'm just scared.
The tournament and everything.

01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:40.240
You remember lesson about balance?

01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:42.880
Yeah.

01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:47.120
Lesson not just karate only.

01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:50.920
Lesson for whole life.

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:55.760
Whole life have a balance.

01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:00.280
Everything be better.

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:04.160
Understand?

01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:07.600
Yeah, I understand.

01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:13.360
Oh, wow.

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:21.280
You're the best friend I ever had.

01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:24.360
You...

01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:27.280
...pretty okay, too.

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:32.760
Go.

01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:35.120
Go find the balance.

01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:47.040
<i>- Banzai, Daniel-san!
- Banzai!</i>

01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:33.480
I give up. Don't shoot! No.

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:37.840
- Don't leave me. I'm wounded.
- Good, maybe you'll die.

01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:45.440
- I just wanted to apologise.
- Fine, you apologised.

01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:48.840
- I got my licence.
- Whoop-dee-doo.

01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:52.400
- What's with you?
- What do you expect? Cartwheels?

01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:58.800
I just expected some courtesy,
or is that only for people with fancy cars?

01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:03.480
Can't you take a hint?

01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:09.600
Does the truth hurt?

01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:12.040
- You really think that's it?
- I know it is.

01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:14.280
- You're wrong.
- I bet I'm wrong.

01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:18.360
I didn't go out with you
because of a car or where you live.

01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:21.000
Okay, while we're on the subject,
why did you then?

01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:23.360
Why did you?

01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:26.640
I thought maybe you and me
were different.

01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:30.080
I'm from Reseda, you're from the hills,
that's how we're different.

01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:33.280
Admit that you just can't handle
the situation the way it is.

01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:36.240
I can handle it fine. You can't.

01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:40.920
What makes you so sensitive?
She's never been anything but nice to you.

01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:44.480
- She used me to make him jealous.
- She doesn't even like him.

01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:48.120
Who could tell, the way their faces
were stuck together at the country club?

01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:52.280
Right, you didn't stick around
for the exciting conclusion.

01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:54.560
- What, his hand on her ass?
- Her right hook.

01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:57.640
You think she sprained her wrist
doing her nails?

01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:02.080
- She hit him?
- That's an understatement.

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:08.360
- Why didn't she say something?
- She shouldn't have to, should she?

01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:28.400
Hey, slugger.

01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:35.560
Look, I'm a jerk.

01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:40.360
You are a jerk.

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:42.920
So, am I forgiven?

01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:46.640
I don't hear anything.

01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:48.960
Sounds like a "yes" to me.

01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:51.720
Come here.

01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:04.800
I guess you know
about the tournament tomorrow.

01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:06.560
Who doesn't?

01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:08.040
Dumb move, huh?

01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:10.360
Not necessarily.

01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:13.360
I don't have much of a cheering section.

01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:15.080
You got me.

01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:18.920
I'll probably get killed in the first match.

01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:21.920
So, we'll leave early.

01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:39.560
- I've got something to show you.
- What?

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.680
- How do you like it?
- Is it yours? Are you serious?

01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:50.080
- It's beautiful.
- It sure is.

01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:52.240
- My God.
- Here you go.

01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:55.240
- You want me to drive?
- It's the '80s!

01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:59.760
- To start, you push that button.
- You're incredible.

01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:04.040
Press the clutch.
Get the lights, no that one.

01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:08.520
Good. Down is first. Let it out slow.

01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:11.080
Hold on!

01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:15.320
This is awesome. How fast does it go?

01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:17.120
Let's not find out.

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:23.200
- What belt are you?
- Why matter?

01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:26.080
This is open division,
it's only for brown belt or above.

01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:27.840
Boy black belt.

01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:32.720
You'd better hustle. They're starting.
Down the hall, to your left.

01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:35.000
- I'll see you inside.
- Okay.

01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:37.880
Excuse me, Mr. Referee.

01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:41.160
This is not "Miyaji." Miyagi.

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:42.960
Miyagi.

01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:44.600
Okay, thank you.

01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:57.480
Well, look who we have here.
Our little friend Danielle.

01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:59.080
Hello, Danielle.

01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:02.160
What's the matter?
Mommy not here to dress you?

01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:06.480
I'm talking to you, punk.
Come on, make a move.

01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:08.360
Hey, save it for the ring.

01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:09.560
Come on!

01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:12.120
- All right.
- Let's go.

01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:13.840
Come on.

01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:16.080
Points or no points...

01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:18.400
...you're dead meat.

01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:21.240
I said out!

01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:24.920
Dead meat.

01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:30.960
Way to go, I think he's gonna cry.

01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:45.880
<i>The winner of the first match
in the open division is Rufus Schneider.</i>

01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:50.040
- Mr. Miyagi.
- Hurry. Tournament starting.

01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:50.880
Where'd we get this?

01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:51.680
<i>Daniel LaRusso...</i>

01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:55.040
<i>- Buddha provide.
- ... please report to Ring 3.</i>

01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:56.840
- Where's Ring 3?
- Over there.

01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:00.320
Hold it! Sorry, teachers and students only.

01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:02.520
He doesn't speak English...

01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:06.520
...and I can't understand his instructions
without her. She's his translator.

01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:12.480
- What did he say?
- You remind him of his uncle in Tokyo.

01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:17.480
- I guess it's okay. What?
- He says you're very kind.

01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:19.560
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.440
- What are the rules here?
- I don't know.

01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:27.120
First time you, first time me.

01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:30.800
I figured you knew about this stuff.
I figured you went to these before.

01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:32.080
Great, I'm dead.

01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:35.760
- You told me you fought a lot.
- For life, not for points.

01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:38.280
Everything above your waist is a point.

01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:41.800
You can hit the head, sternum,
kidneys, ribs. Got it?

01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:44.040
- I hope so.
- You can do it.

01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:46.600
When are you jerks going to grow up?

01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:55.760
- Where am I, over here at this one?
- Number 3.

01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:57.880
- What's that guy kneeling for?
- I don't know.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.960
- Don't you know anything?
- Don't get hit.

01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:13.080
Face. Bow. On guard.

01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:15.000
Fight.

01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:22.440
Back on your line.

01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:24.560
Be tough, Daniel.

01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.360
Come on, be tough.

01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:34.920
Remember your defence. Points coming.
Concentrate. Focus power.

01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:37.240
Remember balance. Make good fight.

01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:42.240
Run out of the ring once more,
it'll cost you a point.

01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:44.120
On guard. Ready?

01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:54.280
That's one, Daniel, come on.

01:44:56.680 --> 01:44:58.080
One more!

01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:00.240
Move back on your line.

01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:03.320
That's one point, round kick.

01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:07.440
Daniel, you're the best!

01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:24.960
You're dead!

01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:04.640
Point! Winner!

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.200
Winner!

01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:58.000
- It must be tight.
- Yeah, right there.

01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:01.360
- I never thought I'd get this far.
- Make two of us.

01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:03.080
Wouldn't it be great if I won?

01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:06.920
- It'd be great if you survive.
- What do you mean "survive"?

01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:11.280
- I'm fine as long as I don't move.
- You've got to move now, they're starting.

01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:14.480
Are they starting now?
What do you mean "survive"?

01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:18.840
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:22.240
<i>... may I have your attention, please.</i>

01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:27.440
<i>This is the first semi-final match
of the afternoon.</i>

01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:34.680
<i>Defending champion,
John Lawrence of the Cobra Kai.</i>

01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:38.640
<i>Two-time winner of the All Valley
Under-18 Golden Trophy.</i>

01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:43.280
<i>He'll be facing Darryl Vidal
of the Locust Valley Karate Club.</i>

01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:48.400
<i>Three points wins.
Contestants, please come to the ring.</i>

01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:50.840
<i>Good luck, gentlemen.</i>

01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:54.600
Go get him, Johnny.

01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:56.920
Show him what you're made of.

01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:59.240
Face me, gentlemen. Bow.

01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:02.600
Face. Bow. Ready?

01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:05.360
Come on, Johnny.

01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:09.960
Fast, Johnny. Come on. Do it.

01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:16.400
One point, Lawrence.

01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:27.160
Lawrence, back on the line.

01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:28.520
Way to go!

01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:30.160
Are you all right?

01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:31.560
I'm okay.

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:35.280
One point, Lawrence.

01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:41.720
Good point, Johnny!

01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:45.360
Point Lawrence. Winner!

01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:53.640
<i>The next semi-final determines
who will face the defending champion.</i>

01:49:54.080 --> 01:50:00.680
<i>Daniel LaRusso, of the Miyagi-do Karate.</i>

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.320
Bobby...

01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:05.720
...I want him out of commission.

01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:08.160
<i>Sensei, I can beat this guy.</i>

01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:13.520
- I don't want him beaten.
- But I'll be disqualified!

01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:15.560
Out of commission.

01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:21.800
<i>Let's go, fellas. Good luck.</i>

01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:33.120
Do what you got to do, Bobby!

01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:41.160
Face. Bow. Ready?

01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:44.400
Watch the control, gentlemen. Ready?

01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:56.360
- I'm sorry! I didn't mean it.
- My leg!

01:50:57.320 --> 01:51:01.200
- Mr. Miyagi, my leg hurts.
- Miyagi here.

01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:07.720
<i>Bobby Brown of the Cobra Kai
has been disqualified...</i>

01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:12.640
<i>... for excessive and deliberate contact.
Under rule 41-2...</i>

01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:17.120
<i>... Daniel LaRusso has 15 minutes
to return to the ring.</i>

01:51:17.240 --> 01:51:19.480
<i>If he is unable to return...</i>

01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:23.720
<i>... John Lawrence will win by default.</i>

01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:30.160
I'll inform the judges.

01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:33.120
You did well out there, young man.

01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:38.840
Damn it!

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.040
Honey, forget it.

01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:43.320
You were great.

01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:45.760
I couldn't be prouder.

01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:47.880
It was just bad luck.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.640
You would have won
if they hadn't cheated.

01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:53.000
Just leave me alone for a minute.

01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:54.520
We'll be outside.

01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:01.120
Mr. Miyagi...

01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:05.800
...you think I had a chance of winning?

01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:07.440
Win, lose, no matter.

01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:09.360
That's not what I mean.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.880
Had good chance.

01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:19.640
Can you fix my leg with that thing you do?

01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:22.040
No need fight anymore.

01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:25.520
- You proved a point.
- What, that I can take a beating?

01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:29.360
Every time I see those guys,
they'll know they got the best of me.

01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:35.360
I'll never have balance that way,
not with them, not with Ali...

01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:40.200
...not with me.

01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:45.680
What?

01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:49.920
Close eye.

01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:14.400
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the moment we've been waiting for.</i>

01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:19.640
<i>Daniel LaRusso's going to fight?</i>

01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:22.360
<i>Daniel LaRusso's going to fight!</i>

01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:26.640
<i>This is what it's all about, folks.
You know it.</i>

01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:29.320
<i>How's the leg, son?</i>

01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:33.480
<i>All right. What a man!</i>

01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:36.120
<i>The final match to determine...</i>

01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:39.120
<i>... who'll emerge victor and champion...</i>

01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:43.360
<i>... of the All Valley Under-18
Karate Championship.</i>

01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:46.560
<i>Daniel LaRusso, Miyaji-do Karate...</i>

01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:49.040
<i>Miyagi-do.</i>

01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:51.320
<i>Miyagi-do Karate.</i>

01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:54.640
<i>... versus John Lawrence of the Cobra Kai.</i>

01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:57.600
<i>Three points wins. Good luck, boys.</i>

01:53:58.240 --> 01:54:00.880
Come on, Daniel!
You've got this guy. You can do it.

01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:09.480
Face me. Bow.

01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:12.760
Face off. Bow. Ready?

01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:23.160
That's okay, Johnny.

01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:24.840
Lawrence, return.

01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:28.000
One point, LaRusso.

01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:29.320
You're dead.

01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:37.120
Daniel, you've got him!

01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:46.440
<i>Point! Jab! That's two for LaRusso.</i>

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:50.160
<i>Time out. Go to your sensei.</i>

01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:51.880
Turn, kneel.

01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:54.280
Johnny, you're a creampuff!

01:54:55.400 --> 01:54:56.520
Sweep the leg.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:00.880
You have a problem with that?

01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:04.080
<i>No, Sensei.</i>

01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:07.400
No mercy.

01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:17.160
One more!

01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:20.800
Two points LaRusso. Lawrence nothing.

01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:31.920
<i>One point Lawrence. 2-1, LaRusso.</i>

01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:55.400
Kick to the side. One point Lawrence. 2-2.

01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:05.000
Out of bounds. Come back in.

01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:08.560
Destroy him, Johnny!

01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:10.800
Come on, Daniel, you can do it!

01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:34.280
Come on, Daniel. Be strong.

01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:38.200
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:41.800
<i>Whoever wins the next point
will be our new champion.</i>

01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:48.080
Finish him, Johnny!

01:56:56.280 --> 01:56:59.000
It's over, Johnny! You did it!

01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:04.200
Are you okay? Can you go on?

01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:07.360
Get him a body bag!

01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:12.360
Warning for illegal contact to the knee.

01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:19.520
Finish him!

01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:29.600
Winner!

01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:41.840
<i>The new champion!</i>

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:46.280
- You're all right, LaRusso.
- Thanks a lot.

01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:54.240
Mr. Miyagi, we did it. All right!
