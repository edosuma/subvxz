01:07.680 --> 01:10.069
I was the third brother of five

01:10.160 --> 01:13.197
Doing whatever I had to do to survive

01:14.440 --> 01:17.159
I'm not saying what I did was all right

01:17.240 --> 01:19.276
Trying to break out of the ghetto

01:19.360 --> 01:21.316
Was a day-to-day fight

01:21.400 --> 01:24.597
Been down so long,
getting up didn't cross my mind

01:24.680 --> 01:28.309
But I knew there was a better way of life
that I was just trying to find

01:28.400 --> 01:31.790
You don't know what you'll do
until you're put under pressure

01:31.880 --> 01:34.758
Across 110th Street is a hell of a tester

01:35.560 --> 01:38.358
Across 110th Street

01:38.440 --> 01:42.479
Pimps trying to catch a woman that's weak

01:42.560 --> 01:44.869
Across 110th Street

01:44.960 --> 01:49.511
The pushers won't let the junkie go free

01:49.600 --> 01:52.273
Across 110th Street

01:52.360 --> 01:56.433
Awoman trying to catch a trick on the street

01:56.520 --> 01:59.557
Across 110th Street

01:59.640 --> 02:06.751
You can find it all, yeah

02:06.840 --> 02:09.513
Find it all in the street

02:09.600 --> 02:13.195
Oh, yeah, yeah

02:13.280 --> 02:16.989
Brother, there's a better way out

02:17.080 --> 02:19.036
Snorting that coke, shooting that dope, man

02:19.120 --> 02:20.394
You're copping out

02:20.480 --> 02:24.553
Take my advice, it's either live or die

02:24.640 --> 02:27.712
You've gotta be strong if you wanna survive

02:27.800 --> 02:31.349
The family on the other side of town

02:31.440 --> 02:33.829
Would catch hell without a ghetto around

02:34.640 --> 02:38.428
In every city you find the same thing going down

02:38.520 --> 02:41.990
Harlem is the capital of every ghetto town

02:42.960 --> 02:44.279
Look around you

02:44.360 --> 02:45.918
Oh, look around you

02:46.000 --> 02:47.752
Look around you

02:47.840 --> 02:50.195
Ooh, look around you, yeah

02:50.280 --> 02:53.238
Ooh, yeah

03:39.800 --> 03:41.756
That's them.

03:46.720 --> 03:49.359
- We had an OK week.
- Why wouldn't we?

04:01.840 --> 04:03.796
Get Monday's stuff together.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.990
Now, what have we got here?

04:12.320 --> 04:15.073
- All right, gentlemen, let's go.
- All right.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.675
575.
575.

04:20.279 --> 04:23.590
590.
575.

04:28.280 --> 04:32.512
First one's 20 from St Nicholas, second 108.

04:35.120 --> 04:37.031
625.

04:37.560 --> 04:40.028
- 625, yeah?
- 625.

04:40.120 --> 04:42.111
783.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.153
- 590.
- 590, check.

04:51.840 --> 04:53.717
575, check.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.070
- OK.
- 623.

05:02.160 --> 05:04.515
623.

05:05.520 --> 05:06.999
Underthe table.

05:07.080 --> 05:09.275
Is anybody in there driving a '68 Caddy?

05:09.920 --> 05:12.878
- It's two cops.
- Give the assholes a couple of dollars.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.516
Give them 20 dollars.

05:16.600 --> 05:20.195
- Everybody back against the window.
- What's going on?

05:20.280 --> 05:23.238
Hey, I know him. That's Jim Harris.

05:23.320 --> 05:25.151
- Where's your gun?
- I don't have any.

05:25.240 --> 05:29.074
- What's up, man?
- What the hell does it look like?

05:29.160 --> 05:32.709
- Up with those hands.
- Thought you were still in the joint.

05:32.800 --> 05:36.270
- Harris, you can't jive in here and take money.
- Shut it.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.830
Come on, baby.

06:19.720 --> 06:21.790
No! For God's sake!

06:52.080 --> 06:54.036
Come on.

07:02.720 --> 07:04.836
Not so goddamn fast.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.550
OK, let's go. Let's go.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.429
Come on.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.995
- Hey, Joe, you all right?
- I'm all right.

07:25.080 --> 07:27.435
Come on, you can't crap out on me now.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.676
What the hell's going on?

07:48.680 --> 07:51.274
Drive, man. Drive.

07:51.360 --> 07:53.999
What happened up there? Shit, the truck.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.235
What's the matter, Henry? Can't you drive?

08:20.320 --> 08:22.959
- It's stalled!
- Then get it going!

08:23.040 --> 08:26.635
- Let's get out of here.
- Hey, Jim, cop! Cop!

08:28.360 --> 08:30.920
Drive. Drive!

08:56.360 --> 09:00.194
Here, Tony, give him a kiss, give him a kiss.

09:00.280 --> 09:04.068
That's it. Remember Grandpa?
He gave you the bicycle last Christmas.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.714
- You wanna hold him, Grandpa?
- What?

09:12.800 --> 09:15.394
- You remember my Uncle Charlie?
- Who?

09:15.480 --> 09:17.755
Uncle Charlie! It's good to see you.

09:39.720 --> 09:43.315
- What are you going outside for?
- Nick! Take the kid.

09:44.280 --> 09:46.032
Take the kid!

09:46.120 --> 09:49.317
- Sure. Anything else?
- No, that's all right.

09:49.400 --> 09:51.356
- You sure?
- That's all right.

09:52.720 --> 09:55.280
Hey, Theresa, take the kids.

09:55.360 --> 09:58.511
God, they're always running all overthe hall.

10:17.320 --> 10:19.675
I love it.
You like this?

10:21.440 --> 10:27.913
Compare mio, da quanto tempo!
Come e bello.

10:29.320 --> 10:32.437
- Nicky, get Mamma some champagne.
- Un pochettino, huh?

10:32.520 --> 10:35.114
You get it for her, Theresa, I'm busy. You get it.

10:37.400 --> 10:40.153
- Hello, Nick.
- How are you? Good to see you.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.993
- Hi.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

10:48.680 --> 10:52.116
- What is it?
- Nick, look.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.676
What do you see?

10:56.560 --> 10:58.516
Central Park.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.636
Central Park, si.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.756
But there's also no-man's-land

11:02.840 --> 11:05.798
that separates us from the black in Harlem.

11:05.880 --> 11:09.236
- Yeah.
- Nick.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.834
Today they took our bank in Harlem

11:11.920 --> 11:14.115
for over 300,000 dollar.

11:14.200 --> 11:16.156
What?

11:16.920 --> 11:19.480
They killed two of the family,

11:19.560 --> 11:22.120
two cops, and two of their own.

11:22.200 --> 11:26.876
Nick, it ain't forthe money, it ain't forthe men,

11:26.960 --> 11:30.350
but we have to teach them a lesson

11:30.440 --> 11:32.396
or we'll lose Harlem.

11:32.480 --> 11:33.469
Yes.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.596
If we lose Harlem,

11:35.680 --> 11:38.353
we lose a lot more than the money.

11:38.440 --> 11:41.796
We lose il prestigio, I'onore.

11:42.600 --> 11:46.115
Nick, chi controlla la giocata

11:47.040 --> 11:50.555
controlla la citta e forse tutto lo Stato.

11:50.640 --> 11:53.518
'They're trying to push us out of Harlem.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.750
'We worked too hard to get it.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.229
'This may be your last chance.

11:58.320 --> 12:00.754
'lt may be mine to do something foryou.

12:00.840 --> 12:05.277
'Take care of yourself, Nick.
They're rough, those niggers.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.351
'All right?

12:07.440 --> 12:09.874
'Now, Nick, say the truth.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.313
- 'Can you handle it? '
- Sure, I can handle it.

12:13.880 --> 12:15.996
- What?
- Yeah, sure you can.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.278
Captain Mattelli, it's been a bitch. World War Two.

12:59.360 --> 13:02.636
So I heard. It's a real beaut, huh?
Where's Reilly?

13:02.720 --> 13:05.234
Last time I saw him he was on the ambulance.

13:06.360 --> 13:10.035
Reilly. Why the hell wasn't I called before?

13:10.120 --> 13:12.998
Frank, you were off duty,
we got to you as soon as we could.

13:13.080 --> 13:15.389
- OK, brief me. Brief me.
- Seven dead.

13:15.480 --> 13:17.869
Seven? I heard six.

13:17.960 --> 13:22.033
Patrolman Hanratty on the way to the hospital,
doesn't stand a chance.

13:22.120 --> 13:25.078
- Anything else?
- Right now, just bodies.

13:25.160 --> 13:27.435
Three white, four black, all dead.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.112
Where were the boys hit?

13:30.200 --> 13:35.832
Hanratty about 30 yards down,
about where that prowl car is.

13:35.920 --> 13:39.549
Patrolman Adams was coming around that corner.

13:39.640 --> 13:42.074
- Where did it happen? Upstairs?
- Yeah.

13:50.040 --> 13:52.918
- How's this car involved?
- Checking the registration.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.956
It must have brought some of them here.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.712
- Hi, Dick.
- Captain.

13:56.800 --> 13:59.439
- New York car?
- Yeah, it's local.

14:02.760 --> 14:06.673
Where's the brass?
Chief of detectives is upstairs.

14:06.760 --> 14:09.752
Mayor's busy upstate,
he's running for governor.

14:09.840 --> 14:12.673
Commissioner's telling a convention
in San Francisco

14:12.760 --> 14:15.399
how beautifully we do things in New York.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.630
That's fine, that's great.

14:19.240 --> 14:21.879
- Anything on the canvass?
- Not a damn thing.

14:21.960 --> 14:25.077
Nobody saw, nobody heard, huh?
No.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.310
- It figures.
- Yeah.

14:30.720 --> 14:35.157
You didn't hear anything?
No. It was just terrible.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.189
The dude they took out before was cut in two.

15:20.080 --> 15:23.914
- Machine gun.
- They've found them halfway down the block.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.150
Nine millimetre. Lots of them.

15:40.720 --> 15:43.109
Jimmy, take a few frontal shots.

15:43.960 --> 15:46.758
- Hello, Frank.
- Hiya, Charlie.

15:46.840 --> 15:50.355
- Got yourself a handful now.
- Things don't add up.

15:50.440 --> 15:54.433
Two whites, three blacks. How do you figure it?

15:54.520 --> 15:57.751
What else brings whites to Harlem
but business?

16:14.480 --> 16:16.550
Who are you?

16:17.280 --> 16:20.033
- You must be Captain Mattelli.
- That's right.

16:20.120 --> 16:23.874
I'm Lieutenant William Aylesworth Pope.
I'm in charge here.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.836
Excuse me.

16:30.320 --> 16:35.474
- What did you say?
- I said I'm Lieutenant Pope. I'm in charge here.

16:38.520 --> 16:40.556
- Meaning what?
- Meaning, Captain,

16:40.640 --> 16:44.758
- I'm Lieutenant Pope, I'm in charge here.
- Frank.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.629
- Hey, Jack.
- Can I talk to you a minute?

16:57.080 --> 17:00.993
- We got the big brass, huh?
- Come on in a minute, I wanna talk to you.

17:01.080 --> 17:05.949
- Yeah?
- Er, shut the door.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.791
- Yeah, Jack?
- Frank, this one's gonna be a bitch.

17:15.880 --> 17:18.234
Downtown's afraid it's gonna hit the fan.

17:18.319 --> 17:20.675
Did you bring me in here to make a speech?

17:20.760 --> 17:24.548
- No I didn't. You're not gonna like it.
- Stop dancing around. Tell me.

17:24.640 --> 17:29.191
Politicians feel that this other guy here
should carry the ball.

17:29.280 --> 17:32.875
- Who?
- Him. The black guy.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.629
- Why, because he's black?
- Because he's black, yeah.

17:37.720 --> 17:41.713
Jack, here in Harlem he's gonna get
the same flak I do. He's still a cop.

17:41.800 --> 17:43.518
What the hell do you care?

17:43.600 --> 17:48.720
Can he stop a race riot because he's black?
Last year I stopped it myself, Jack.

17:48.800 --> 17:52.270
- It's just politics, Frank.
- Screw politics.

17:52.360 --> 17:54.635
Look, I'm not gonna listen to any of this.

17:54.720 --> 17:58.713
You've got to get it through your head, Frank.
It's his baby.

17:58.800 --> 18:02.713
- Get that through your head.
- You force this on me and I'll resign.

18:08.720 --> 18:11.837
I'll give it to you straight. They'd like that.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.915
They're pushing out everybody over 50.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.118
- How old are you?
- You know damn well I'm 55 just like you.

18:20.840 --> 18:23.559
What do we do because we're 55? Eat shit?

18:28.720 --> 18:30.756
I don't know, Frank.

18:30.840 --> 18:32.990
I made peace with my reality.

18:34.160 --> 18:37.152
You're gonna have to make it with yours.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.077
What's his name?

19:02.040 --> 19:06.192
Son of a bitch, we're in fortrouble -
it's the old man's son-in-law.

19:08.400 --> 19:11.312
Hey, Nick. What do you say, Nick?

19:12.760 --> 19:14.830
Long time no see.

19:19.360 --> 19:21.555
Come on. I wanna talk to you.

19:38.080 --> 19:40.514
You didn't have any guard downstairs?

19:40.600 --> 19:42.716
You didn't have a lookout, huh?

19:44.200 --> 19:46.998
15 years, we never been hit.

19:47.080 --> 19:49.116
We change apartments.

19:49.200 --> 19:52.875
We never used that one before,
we thought we were OK.

19:52.960 --> 19:54.837
You thought?

19:54.920 --> 19:59.311
Your ass must've been thinking
because now we're out $300,000.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.278
Do you hear me good? We're out $300,000.

20:02.360 --> 20:04.476
Now what do we do?

20:04.560 --> 20:08.838
I don't blame the old man for being mad
but anybody can get ripped off.

20:08.920 --> 20:11.195
Not when you work for us.

20:11.280 --> 20:15.068
Harlem is ours. We found it, we made it,
and we're gonna keep it.

20:15.160 --> 20:19.312
This shit ain't ever gonna happen again.
You hear me? Ever.

20:22.760 --> 20:24.876
Now, who did it?

20:26.880 --> 20:30.156
Three black guys. Two dressed as policemen.

20:31.160 --> 20:35.597
I got a reward out for information. A grand.

20:35.680 --> 20:39.116
- Shevvy here's in charge.
- A grand?

20:39.200 --> 20:42.237
What... What are you trying to do? You trying?

20:42.320 --> 20:45.357
You telling me you really want
to find these guys?

20:45.440 --> 20:47.908
What are you talking about?

20:49.160 --> 20:51.754
Five. Five grand.

20:55.360 --> 20:57.396
Five grand.

20:58.040 --> 21:01.953
That's good. Now find them.
But don't touch, they're mine.

21:02.040 --> 21:03.996
I'm gonna teach these guys a lesson.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.150
Goddamn it, D'Salvio.

21:06.960 --> 21:11.272
I've been in charge here 15 years
and nobody tells me how to run my business.

21:11.360 --> 21:16.388
Hey, hey! Your business is running our business.
Do you understand that?

21:16.480 --> 21:19.392
You may be a big shot around here up in Harlem

21:19.480 --> 21:22.756
but below 110th Street
you're nothing but a hired nigger.

21:23.920 --> 21:26.195
That's all.

21:32.600 --> 21:37.230
It's not smart forthree dagos
to run around killing brothers up here.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.236
Fuck you and your brothers.

21:56.440 --> 21:59.512
- Hey, D'Salvio!
- Yeah?

21:59.600 --> 22:04.196
You ain't never gonna make it. You know that?
What are you, 45 years old?

22:04.280 --> 22:07.875
You were a punk errand boy
when you married the boss's daughter

22:07.960 --> 22:10.713
and you're still a punk errand boy.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.556
- You motherfucker.
- No, Nick!

22:14.640 --> 22:17.279
- Nick, no.
- All right, all right, all right.

22:49.320 --> 22:53.598
I would've liked to seen Doc's face
when he heard his bank was knocked over.

22:59.920 --> 23:04.675
Hey, Shevvy. Welcome to the 7/11.
What's your pleasure?

23:04.760 --> 23:06.955
You got a chick here named Gloria Roberts?

23:07.040 --> 23:10.510
Yeah, she shills here. Down there.

23:29.520 --> 23:31.670
- You know who I am?
- Yeah.

23:31.760 --> 23:34.194
You work for Poppa Bear.
I used to see you around.

23:34.280 --> 23:37.431
You're in a position to see a whole lot of things.

23:38.160 --> 23:40.879
A hundred bucks for anything interesting.

23:42.160 --> 23:44.390
There's the number.

23:47.640 --> 23:49.710
Hey, Glo.

23:49.800 --> 23:53.349
You losing all your baby fat, you looking good.

23:53.440 --> 23:57.956
It's the big hit today. That's it. The big hit.

23:59.240 --> 24:02.198
You looking real good.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.832
Next time we give a party, you gonna be there.

24:08.440 --> 24:10.396
Yeah.

24:23.160 --> 24:26.072
You got a gangster, what you need's a pimp.

24:27.040 --> 24:29.110
'Late this afternoon...

24:29.200 --> 24:32.829
'... broke into a Harlem apartment
and gunned down five occupants.'

24:32.920 --> 24:36.708
Goddamn it, Joe.
You couldn't come by two minutes early?

24:36.800 --> 24:38.279
I doubt that.

24:38.360 --> 24:41.477
'... Timothy Hanratty,
cut down both with machine-gun fire.

24:41.560 --> 24:44.313
'Officer Adams died instantly
from multiple wounds.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.472
'Officer Hanratty passed away
on the operating table... '

24:47.560 --> 24:52.190
How 'bout that? Couple of idiots killed
two more cops and one of them's a brother.

24:52.280 --> 24:54.430
Goddamn.

24:54.520 --> 24:58.593
'lt is assumed that Mattelli
will handle the investigation.'

25:01.440 --> 25:04.477
If you don't want my love

25:06.640 --> 25:09.757
If you don't need my love

25:10.720 --> 25:12.870
Baby, give...

25:12.960 --> 25:14.916
Mm!

25:15.000 --> 25:17.070
Hey.

25:17.160 --> 25:19.390
Oh, I'd like to have it now

25:22.720 --> 25:25.871
If you don't need my love...

25:27.560 --> 25:30.836
Mm! Shazam! Goddamn.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.309
All you gotta do is

25:33.400 --> 25:36.597
Give it back

25:38.080 --> 25:40.594
I believe some lonely heart could use it

25:46.160 --> 25:48.515
Oh, don't let temptation

25:51.360 --> 25:53.476
Don't let it get the best of you

25:57.000 --> 25:59.150
See you can't have your cake, baby

26:07.240 --> 26:11.677
Hey. I've got a problem.

26:13.800 --> 26:17.395
Damn. You got a problem? How does he feel?

26:17.480 --> 26:20.711
He didn't have them on at the time.
Can you fix them?

26:21.560 --> 26:24.791
Yeah. Hold on a minute.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.029
Hyme's Cleaners.

26:26.120 --> 26:30.272
Joe. Hey, this is me. Is that you?

26:32.080 --> 26:36.153
Hold the phone, will you?
Hey, look, the lady who fixes these is out.

26:36.240 --> 26:40.995
Why don't you bring them back in the morning
and pick them up at night, OK?

26:46.120 --> 26:51.478
- What's happening, man?
- H-H-Hey, man, ljust had to say,

26:51.560 --> 26:54.393
we did it, man, we did it.

26:59.040 --> 27:02.430
- Hey, look, you smoking?
- ' Course not.'

27:02.520 --> 27:05.478
Look, we are on fire.

27:13.160 --> 27:15.116
Ooh.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.433
Mm.

27:46.800 --> 27:49.917
- Yeah?
- Henry J is getting highed-up, man.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.276
- Who's it for?
- Son of a bitch.

27:53.360 --> 27:55.351
'What are we gonna do? '

27:55.440 --> 27:57.749
Nothing. Stay loose.

27:58.560 --> 28:03.873
Hey Harris, the goddamn toilet's flushing
into the sink again. Can't you fix it right?

28:04.480 --> 28:06.516
I did what I can without a new valve.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.795
What we gonna do tonight?

28:10.000 --> 28:12.514
Why don't you call the owner in Mexico?

28:12.600 --> 28:15.239
He's usually there this time of the year.

28:30.040 --> 28:31.837
You're lucky, I think it's water.

28:31.920 --> 28:35.037
There's a law against withholding information.

28:35.120 --> 28:37.759
But I tell you, we had the radio on.

28:39.160 --> 28:43.915
You live directly across the street
and over a hundred rounds were fired.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.834
- They play the radio loud.
- Jesus Christ.

28:47.920 --> 28:50.559
Sorry, Officer, we can't be of more help.

28:52.120 --> 28:54.156
We didn't hear or see anything.

28:56.360 --> 28:57.952
Cool it, Jessup.

28:58.040 --> 29:02.511
That's a hundred-dollar bill, brother,
and it be yours if you want it.

29:05.400 --> 29:08.198
Honest man work hard for a hundred dollars.

29:08.280 --> 29:11.431
I'm a brother asking for help and willing to pay.

29:12.520 --> 29:15.193
Go on, take it, Jessup, and let me in,

29:15.280 --> 29:17.510
oryou'd better never go out again.

29:19.920 --> 29:21.876
I'm opening.

29:24.760 --> 29:28.753
You know, you done real good
not to say anything to the man.

29:35.800 --> 29:39.759
What the hell you expect me to say?
I don't know a damn thing.

29:39.840 --> 29:44.072
- I don't know nothing, man.
- You mean you didn't hear a goddamn noise?

29:44.160 --> 29:47.948
Most men don't rap much
when I'm copping their joint. Want to try me?

29:48.040 --> 29:50.838
Hey, what kind of talk is that? Reilly!

29:50.920 --> 29:53.036
I don't know nothing.

29:54.040 --> 29:57.271
- What the hell's going on?
- He's hauling in a lot of garbage.

29:57.360 --> 30:01.717
Just came in foryou.
Male Caucasian, armed robbery.

30:03.160 --> 30:06.869
- Five Asians, huh?
- Listen, Frank, this just came in too.

30:06.960 --> 30:10.839
We got a make on the getaway car -
chequered sedan, '66, '67,

30:10.920 --> 30:13.639
crumpled right fender, painted black, lot of rust.

30:13.720 --> 30:17.190
- Does the lieutenant have this?
- No. I thought it'd be better...

30:17.280 --> 30:21.159
- I appreciate what you're trying to do.
- Why let him take the credit?

30:21.240 --> 30:24.357
Dave, this is his operation. But thanks.

30:26.200 --> 30:28.714
The Captain will be here shortly.

30:28.800 --> 30:31.473
- Captain.
- Hi, Charley. Why are you here?

30:32.680 --> 30:35.433
- Sidney's here? Who brought him in?
- Yeah.

30:35.520 --> 30:40.071
- All right. Marti, ma che fai qua?
- Sto vigliacco m'ha arrestato per niente!

30:40.160 --> 30:41.957
- Arrestato perché?
- Per niente.

30:42.040 --> 30:43.996
- What's the charge?
- Making a book.

30:44.080 --> 30:46.640
Book? He can't even read! Let him go.

30:47.560 --> 30:52.793
- Macché tuo padre!
- Quante volte ti ho detto, eh? Allora vai via.

30:52.880 --> 30:55.314
- Let him go.
- Chief, I gotta talk to you.

30:55.400 --> 30:58.870
I'm not taking any stuff,
they just dragged me in here.

30:58.960 --> 31:01.520
- Really? OK, I'll take care of it.
- Yeah.

31:02.240 --> 31:04.356
Honey, will you coveryourtits?

31:06.400 --> 31:08.994
- Listen, I've been straight.
- I warned you.

31:09.080 --> 31:11.992
- He was lying, man.
- You got any shit on you?

31:12.080 --> 31:14.640
Hell no, man. I said I'm straight.

31:14.720 --> 31:16.836
Charley, can't you see I'm busy?

31:16.920 --> 31:19.832
- But nobody...
- I'll take care of it.

31:19.920 --> 31:22.718
Just stay clean. I'll take care of it, Charley.

31:23.920 --> 31:26.115
I swear, I didn't see anything.

31:26.800 --> 31:29.553
There's a machine gun going
and you heard nothing?

31:29.640 --> 31:32.313
No. Man, you must be new around here.

31:32.400 --> 31:34.470
How you doing, Lieutenant?

31:35.120 --> 31:37.076
- I'm getting there.
- That's good.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.515
- How are you, Sidney?
- How are you, Captain?

31:39.600 --> 31:44.276
I've known this man foryears,
he's harmless. I'll vouch for him.

31:45.320 --> 31:48.118
Go on, Sidney. Charley's hysterical.

31:49.600 --> 31:51.556
Thank God.

31:52.520 --> 31:54.875
Pope, I know this punk. Can I be of any help?

31:54.960 --> 31:56.598
No, thank you, Captain.

31:56.680 --> 31:59.956
Chink, we've tangled before.
Answerthis man's questions.

32:00.040 --> 32:01.792
Captain, please.

32:01.880 --> 32:04.394
I'm just trying to help you both.

32:10.120 --> 32:12.076
At 3:47,

32:12.160 --> 32:16.790
more than 150 rounds of ammunition were fired
into your apartment 200 yards away.

32:16.880 --> 32:21.192
Afew moments later, another 50 to 75 rounds
were fired in the street

32:21.280 --> 32:23.430
in a direct sightline from your newsstand.

32:23.520 --> 32:25.511
Two policemen were killed.

32:26.240 --> 32:30.313
A car drove down the street and passed
ten feet from where you were,

32:30.400 --> 32:33.198
turned to the right and went in front of you,

32:33.280 --> 32:36.078
and you're gonna tell me you didn't see a thing?

32:36.160 --> 32:39.948
Brother, I'd rathertalk to you
than a racist honky pig, man.

32:40.040 --> 32:42.395
Why won't you believe me, man?

32:42.480 --> 32:45.597
Don't give me that brother crap.
I asked you a question.

32:45.680 --> 32:48.592
How can you be deaf,
dumb and blind forfive hours?

32:48.680 --> 32:51.069
I didn't see anything.

32:51.160 --> 32:54.630
I'll break every bone in your body
if you don't answerthis man.

32:54.720 --> 32:57.553
You'd better answerthis man's questions.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.992
- I said I didn't need your help and I meant it.
- OK. OK.

33:03.080 --> 33:05.116
We'll play it your way, Pope.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.156
What have you come up with, huh?

33:08.880 --> 33:11.030
- We're getting there.
- Oh, you are?

33:11.120 --> 33:13.236
My boys came up with this.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.595
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

33:24.680 --> 33:27.956
- Here, put out an all-units on this.
- Yes, sir.

33:28.040 --> 33:30.076
Goodbye, Captain.

33:31.920 --> 33:33.911
OK, Mr Pope.

33:42.200 --> 33:43.792
Money, baby!

33:43.880 --> 33:45.950
Money!

33:49.880 --> 33:52.348
Tell me something, Henry, tell me something.

33:52.440 --> 33:55.113
- What?
- Where'd you get all that?

33:55.200 --> 33:58.078
I won first prize in a beauty contest.

33:59.480 --> 34:00.708
Money!

34:06.360 --> 34:08.476
You must've gone crazy.

34:10.600 --> 34:12.556
Crazy?

34:15.360 --> 34:17.476
Maybe.

34:17.560 --> 34:19.630
But we won, Gloria.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.636
We won.

34:30.159 --> 34:33.835
I didn't wanna kill nobody. It wasn't in the plan.

34:35.040 --> 34:37.110
Give it back.

34:43.960 --> 34:46.996
I'd rather see you in jail than dead.

34:47.080 --> 34:51.039
At least I could see you.
They ain't executed nobody in ten years.

34:51.120 --> 34:53.235
Give the mob back the money.

34:53.320 --> 34:58.633
I can't give the mob back the five men I shot.
Orthe cops back theirtwo.

34:58.720 --> 35:01.154
- They don't make deals.
- Money talks.

35:01.240 --> 35:04.676
- The dead are dead but you can deal with it.
- Gloria.

35:04.760 --> 35:08.469
I always figured you
a step and a half ahead of the pack

35:08.560 --> 35:10.835
but you sound like all the other dumb broads.

35:10.920 --> 35:14.515
- You don't stand a chance.
- I ain't giving nothing back.

35:14.600 --> 35:16.989
Not one dime.

35:17.080 --> 35:19.640
You don't stand a chance of living out the week.

35:19.720 --> 35:23.110
What do you mean, we don't stand a chance
of living out the week?

35:23.200 --> 35:27.239
We didn't stand a chance of spotting
that Cadillac but we did.

35:27.320 --> 35:32.872
We didn't stand a chance of it being
the same fat-faced accountant but it was.

35:32.960 --> 35:37.875
You see, like, not a chance in hell of walking into
that room and coming out alive,

35:37.960 --> 35:39.916
much less with 300,000,

35:40.000 --> 35:41.956
but we did.

35:42.040 --> 35:45.953
And now you're talking about we don't have
a chance of living out the week.

35:46.040 --> 35:47.996
No chance at all?

35:49.120 --> 35:51.270
Well, I'm rolling.

35:51.360 --> 35:55.148
You see? I made my point, ten times today,

35:55.240 --> 35:57.276
and I've still got the dice.

35:57.360 --> 35:59.316
And I'm gonna keep on rolling.

36:01.640 --> 36:03.596
Yeah, all right, then.

36:03.680 --> 36:07.514
At first, you told me not to try it,
but you was wrong, bad wrong.

36:08.400 --> 36:11.472
Until six o'clock this evening,
what was sure for me?

36:11.560 --> 36:14.028
I'll tell you what - prison.

36:14.120 --> 36:17.317
Back in the joint again, beating my pud.

36:17.400 --> 36:19.755
Or outside in some assholed job

36:19.840 --> 36:22.559
like a janitor or a porter.

36:22.640 --> 36:25.996
You know, cleaning up
after some goddamn white man.

36:26.080 --> 36:28.469
That was sure. That was dead sure.

36:28.560 --> 36:30.312
You would've gotten a job.

36:30.400 --> 36:32.038
Look at me.

36:32.960 --> 36:34.916
Look at me!

36:35.720 --> 36:39.429
You're looking at a 42-year-old ex-con nigger,

36:39.520 --> 36:43.399
with no schooling, no trade,
and a medical problem.

36:43.480 --> 36:48.110
Who would want me for anything
but washing cars or swinging a pick?

36:48.200 --> 36:51.749
You've gotta get your mind
out of that white woman's dream.

37:13.240 --> 37:16.232
It was gonna be one nothing job after another.

37:23.560 --> 37:25.915
And you'd be working in that club,

37:28.520 --> 37:32.911
still being propositioned every night.

37:36.440 --> 37:38.635
How long would it be before we...

37:39.520 --> 37:42.353
we needed the bread so bad
that I'd tell you to do it?

37:44.400 --> 37:46.152
Huh?

39:03.200 --> 39:06.988
Got any numbers on it?
Not a number on it anywhere.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.197
- What have you found?
- I can't find a thing, Lieutenant.

39:23.480 --> 39:25.948
Get over here, come on.

39:28.800 --> 39:33.351
Listen, you know where the NYPD garage is
on Center Street?

39:33.440 --> 39:35.874
That's a 40-dollartow job.

39:35.960 --> 39:41.432
I ain't going on no 40-dollartow
without a written paperfrom somebody in charge.

39:45.920 --> 39:48.115
I'm somebody in charge.

39:50.240 --> 39:53.710
I'm taking it down the precinct garage,
no further.

40:05.960 --> 40:10.590
You son of a bitch! Come back here!

40:30.400 --> 40:33.915
Hey, Shevvy. Guy on the phone,
says his name is Howard Jello.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.197
Yeah, I know him. He's a cop with a big mouth.

40:41.840 --> 40:45.435
- Shevvy.
- Hey, man, I hearyou been missing me.

40:46.560 --> 40:50.075
- When you coming back uptown?
- Soon as I get reassigned.

40:50.160 --> 40:52.116
I'm starving to death downtown.

40:54.360 --> 40:58.194
I work at headquarters.
We got the make on the getaway car.

40:58.280 --> 41:00.236
And we got the make on the owners.

41:00.320 --> 41:04.233
- 'I hearyou'd pay pretty good forthis.'
- One bill for name of owner.

41:06.360 --> 41:09.955
Well, a bill's better
than what I've been doing down here.

41:11.400 --> 41:13.311
Mr and Mrs...

41:14.320 --> 41:18.472
Glenn W Fears.

41:24.720 --> 41:27.473
- Is your name Glenn Fears?
- Yep.

41:28.600 --> 41:30.795
Do you own a 1966 chequered sedan?

41:30.880 --> 41:32.836
I got rid of that car last week.

41:33.480 --> 41:36.711
- Seven men were killed.
- I had nothing to do with that.

41:36.800 --> 41:40.076
Glenn, you drove that getaway car, didn't you?

41:40.160 --> 41:42.754
- No, I didn't drive it.
- I know you drove that car.

41:42.840 --> 41:45.070
Your ass, I did.

41:49.880 --> 41:51.552
Mattelli!

41:55.600 --> 41:57.556
What the hell are you doing?

41:57.640 --> 42:01.758
- This junkie drove the getaway car.
- I swearto God I didn't.

42:02.440 --> 42:04.192
Fears.

42:08.040 --> 42:11.396
You don't have to answer any questions
without a lawyer.

42:11.480 --> 42:13.436
You're entitled to an attorney.

42:13.520 --> 42:15.954
I'm-a get me a lawyer
and sic him dead on your ass.

42:16.040 --> 42:18.190
- I'll give you lawyer!
- Yelping.

42:20.280 --> 42:23.192
- This kind of thing went out with Prohibition.
- Look...

42:23.280 --> 42:26.078
I'm sick and tired of your liberal bullshit.

42:26.160 --> 42:29.869
Make up your mind -
are you a cop or one of them social workers?

42:29.960 --> 42:31.837
All right, Captain.

42:32.480 --> 42:34.869
Go back to 1940.

42:34.960 --> 42:39.078
Pull out the powder keg,
blow up the whole goddamn community.

42:40.320 --> 42:43.517
Look, the way I work gets results.

42:45.240 --> 42:47.356
I don't hear him saying a goddamn thing.

42:52.640 --> 42:54.596
No shit.

42:58.320 --> 43:00.834
Now he didn't tell them nothing, right?

43:00.920 --> 43:03.957
Told me he didn't say a thing.

43:04.040 --> 43:06.918
Mrs Fears, this is ourfriend, Nick.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.231
Mrs Fears, it's a real pleasure to see you here.

43:10.320 --> 43:13.790

43:13.880 --> 43:17.634
Now, Mrs Fears, Doc is gonna show

44:03.480 --> 44:06.756
Get me some gin and some champagne

44:06.840 --> 44:11.197

- Oh, Lord have mercy!

44:11.280 --> 44:13.236
Champagne.

44:14.920 --> 44:18.196
Yeah. Give me another glass, too.

44:21.400 --> 44:23.391

45:23.000 --> 45:26.629
You want your brains all overthat wall, brother?

45:26.720 --> 45:28.438
Are you talking to me, white man?

45:28.520 --> 45:31.034

45:31.960 --> 45:36.238

That's a beauty.
You gonna buy us a couple of snorts?

45:47.320 --> 45:51.518

45:51.600 --> 45:53.716
- He is.

45:54.400 --> 45:57.039
Who are you boying?

46:00.840 --> 46:03.957

- He's a doll.

46:06.080 --> 46:08.036
Aah! Aah!

46:10.320 --> 46:12.276

46:28.320 --> 46:31.551
Let him go. Let him go.

46:45.320 --> 46:47.550
Get up. Head up.

47:01.040 --> 47:04.476
Get up. Get up, you dirty bastard. Get up.

47:25.200 --> 47:27.156
Get me my coat, Frank.

47:36.080 --> 47:38.036
All right, get him out of here.

47:38.800 --> 47:42.156
We'll take care of him some more.
Get him out of here.

47:50.800 --> 47:53.872
Anybody here... seen anything?

48:08.800 --> 48:11.872
- Can you hear me?
- He needs plasma. Hold that.

48:11.960 --> 48:13.916
Tell me your name, brother.

48:15.280 --> 48:19.159
Tell me, who done this to you?
Boy, I'm trying to help you.

48:19.240 --> 48:21.196
- Will he make it?
- I'm doing my best.

48:21.280 --> 48:26.718
Was it a brother or was he white?
Tell me, boy, cos I'm trying to help you.

48:26.800 --> 48:29.633
Tell me, was it a brother or was it a whitey?

48:29.720 --> 48:33.156
Help me! Help me, Jimbo!

48:33.240 --> 48:35.470

48:35.560 --> 48:38.393
- Wait a minute. Boy, tell me.
- Jim.

48:38.480 --> 48:40.516
Jim who?

48:40.600 --> 48:43.910
You gotta tell me, boy, cos you're dying.

48:44.720 --> 48:47.757
You dumb bastard, I tell you...

49:00.240 --> 49:02.356
There's no pulse now.

49:20.160 --> 49:21.878
No more crucifixions.

49:23.480 --> 49:26.790
My people don't crucify anybody, Frank.

49:26.880 --> 49:29.348
Crucifying's wop shit.

49:29.440 --> 49:31.510
Doc...

49:32.440 --> 49:34.510
no more crucifixions.

49:39.480 --> 49:41.755
Am I hearing you right?

49:42.520 --> 49:46.149
- Are you giving me orders?
- You're goddamn right I am.

49:48.200 --> 49:50.839
- Show him out, Shevvy.
- Who the fuck do you?

49:50.920 --> 49:53.115
No, Captain, or I'll blow your brains...

49:54.480 --> 49:56.710
Two against two. That's fair.

49:57.960 --> 50:00.030
You be happy, Frank.

50:01.440 --> 50:05.194
The last suckerthat put his hands on me lost.

50:09.680 --> 50:12.592
Hi. You're new here, ain't you?

50:13.760 --> 50:15.876
College boy?

50:15.960 --> 50:19.350
- Two years.
- Right on, baby.

50:19.440 --> 50:21.271
Yeah.

50:29.240 --> 50:31.959
I could get you his job.

50:37.160 --> 50:40.357
They're looking for
bright black boys on the force.

50:42.200 --> 50:44.953
How much are we paying this dude, Shevvy?

50:45.040 --> 50:47.998
He's the guy that sent back
the Christmas present.

50:48.080 --> 50:52.039
Yeah? Mr Mattelli don't do that.

50:54.360 --> 50:58.319
We've been giving him 2,500 a month
forthe past two years.

51:01.920 --> 51:04.957
And he come in here, giving me orders. Shit.

51:05.040 --> 51:07.235
He works for me.

51:08.640 --> 51:12.269
He works for me,
the same as the whores and the dealers.

51:14.560 --> 51:18.030
- I only took gambling money.
- Yeah, they all say that.

51:18.120 --> 51:24.468
No. No, you don't take whoring money,
you don't take dirty junkie money.

51:24.560 --> 51:27.677
You only take nice, clean numbers money.

51:28.440 --> 51:31.352
Where do you think it comes from?
The men below us.

51:31.840 --> 51:36.231
Dirty money or clean money, it's all the same.
Now get the hell out of here.

51:36.960 --> 51:39.520
Look, I came to give you a message.

51:39.600 --> 51:42.672
If you're too dumb to understand,
that's your business.

51:42.760 --> 51:46.070
Any more bodies, I'm coming afteryou.
You hear me?

51:46.160 --> 51:49.516
You watch your motherfucking mouth, white boy.

51:49.600 --> 51:53.991
You might be something big
to those booty-butts at the station

51:54.080 --> 51:56.310
but, goddamn it, this is me.

51:56.400 --> 51:58.595
Doc motherfucking Johnson.

52:00.320 --> 52:04.711
You come running in here
because a couple of your cops got nined.

52:05.280 --> 52:07.555
Especially because one was white.

52:09.840 --> 52:12.638
Yourfriend is a racist son of a bitch.

52:12.720 --> 52:15.075
He always has been. They all are.

52:16.920 --> 52:20.310
If you're smart, you'll stick with me.

52:24.400 --> 52:26.391
Hey, Shevvy,

52:27.520 --> 52:29.556
give him a taste.

52:46.080 --> 52:48.230
Hey, come on.

52:48.920 --> 52:52.549
Don't waste your career on the force, my boy.

52:53.880 --> 52:55.438
Take the money, brother.

52:58.440 --> 53:01.079
You stick it up your ass, brother.

53:04.440 --> 53:06.396
Ah, well, OK.

53:08.880 --> 53:11.519
Take the old man home.

53:15.520 --> 53:18.557
Stand up, you bastard. I'll show you how old I am.

53:18.640 --> 53:22.519
Go on, pull it.
Pull it, you motherfucking Johnson.

53:22.600 --> 53:24.795
Go on, pull it.

53:24.880 --> 53:27.519
You're crazy, Mattelli.

53:27.600 --> 53:31.559
You don't wanna keep on living. You wanna die.

53:32.440 --> 53:34.556
I'm not gonna help you.

53:37.280 --> 53:40.033
Hey, boy, see where my hands are.

53:42.400 --> 53:45.233
Shevvy, show him out.

53:47.360 --> 53:50.113
- Look, Doc...
- So long, Mattelli.

53:51.240 --> 53:53.196
Been nice knowing you.

53:54.800 --> 53:56.153
Captain.

53:57.200 --> 53:58.599
Let's go.

54:20.680 --> 54:22.636
Goddamn clown.

54:29.280 --> 54:31.271
OK, Mr Pope.

54:32.200 --> 54:34.270
Now we can go.

54:38.640 --> 54:41.074
I don't know why I bother keeping them clean.

54:41.160 --> 54:45.199
- Pride of service.
- Some wino will puke on this by midnight.

54:46.760 --> 54:49.877
Do you hearthey found
some poor bastard crucified?

54:49.960 --> 54:52.758
They think it's one of the guys
that did the hit today.

54:52.840 --> 54:55.991
- How do they know who it was?
- Fingerprints.

54:57.280 --> 54:59.316
Guy named Jackson.

55:00.680 --> 55:02.636
Hey, come on, come on, huh?

55:03.520 --> 55:05.954
- How much?
- A dollar seven, with tax.

55:08.200 --> 55:10.350
Screw the tax - here's a buck.

55:15.640 --> 55:18.154
- Yeah. Even cut his balls off.
- Wow.

55:34.480 --> 55:37.472
'... 57 persons aboard.
An airport spokesman said... '

55:40.720 --> 55:44.190
How would you like to live in this toilet, Mattelli?

55:44.280 --> 55:47.317
I did, Mr Pope. I did.

56:03.880 --> 56:06.917
- Yes?
- Mrs Jackson?

56:07.000 --> 56:10.515
- Yes?
- We're police officers, Mrs Jackson.

56:10.600 --> 56:12.716
- What?
- Police.

56:17.960 --> 56:20.030
Mrs Henry J Jackson?

56:23.520 --> 56:26.671
- We don't have any trouble here.
- Can we come in?

56:31.840 --> 56:33.796
Please.

56:47.320 --> 56:49.880
Came to ask about a friend of your husband's.

56:50.520 --> 56:52.590
His name is Jim.

56:53.240 --> 56:56.471
- Ask Henry J.
- You must know somebody named Jim.

56:56.560 --> 57:00.439
Henry J is at his garage
on 137th Street and St Nick. Ask him.

57:00.520 --> 57:02.795
I don't know nothing about no Jim.

57:02.880 --> 57:06.111
Mrs Jackson, are you
and your husband separated?

57:06.200 --> 57:10.512
We haven't been together
for a couple of months but we're not separated.

57:11.680 --> 57:15.070
Mrs Jackson, I don't know
how to tell you this but...

57:16.320 --> 57:18.436
your husband is dead.

57:18.520 --> 57:20.636
I'm... l'm very sorry.

57:32.640 --> 57:35.712
- How did he die?
- The fact is that...

57:35.800 --> 57:38.155
It was an automobile accident.

57:40.280 --> 57:42.316
Hit and run.

57:47.400 --> 57:51.678
- Her husband is dead.
- Yes, I know.

58:04.200 --> 58:05.952
Mrs Jackson,

58:06.040 --> 58:08.474
now about this fella, Jim.

58:08.560 --> 58:10.835
Can you tell us anything about him?

58:16.080 --> 58:20.676
- You kids have an uncle named Jim, huh?
- The kid doesn't have anything to do with this.

58:20.760 --> 58:23.877
He used to call him "big fella".

58:25.120 --> 58:28.430
Big fella. I didn't know him.

58:28.520 --> 58:30.590
Uh,

58:30.680 --> 58:32.557
I didn't know him.

58:32.640 --> 58:35.074
He said he was over six foot, though.

58:36.040 --> 58:39.874
Henry J, he called him...
His name was Jim Harris.

58:41.240 --> 58:43.071
Jim...

58:43.160 --> 58:45.276
Um...

58:45.360 --> 58:47.476
He used to visit him in jail, even.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.116
He gonna be in there foryears and years.

58:53.640 --> 58:55.596
Mrs Jackson.

58:57.480 --> 59:01.712
The coroner's office will be
getting in contact with you.

59:01.800 --> 59:04.394
Will they make a fuss when I go downtown?

59:06.560 --> 59:10.678
We didn't have no paper.
We were common-law.

59:10.760 --> 59:13.911
They want you to identify
and claim the body. That's all.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.150
That won't be necessary.

59:16.240 --> 59:22.110
If you have any trouble, just go
to the 27th precinct and ask for Frank Mattelli.

59:25.160 --> 59:27.628
You want me to write it down foryou?

59:29.200 --> 59:31.156
No, I can remember. Thank you.

59:37.200 --> 59:39.111
Jim Harris, huh?

59:43.280 --> 59:47.717
Look, this was in your husband's pocket
when we found him.

59:47.800 --> 59:49.950
I guess it belongs to you now.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:29.598
His name's Logart. Joe Logart.

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:47.555
Hey, Jim, it's me.

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:53.275
Jim, you in there?

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.999
Jim, it's Joe.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.070
They got Henry J.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.236
They castrated his balls.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.270
You taking off?

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.516
You gotta figure he talked.

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.916
Maybe.

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:39.838
We always figured,
if they got one of us, you know?

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:42.912
Anybody start fucking with my balls, I'd talk.

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:46.636
Yeah.

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.158
I figure they'd be looking hardest in the ghettos.

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.390
I'm getting out, man.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.429

Yeah.

You OK?

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:28.391
I kind of went to pieces
on you up there, didn't I?

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:32.035
Thanks for pulling me out of it, man.

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:41.551
- ljust didn't think it'd be that rough.
- Forget it, Joe. It's over.

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:47.152
We got what we went after, and we're still alive.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:53.197
It didn't start hitting me
until we started to climb them stairs, man.

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:59.638
Everything seemed so shaky, you know?

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.470
And those shots, man.

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.311
Those shots.

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.436
And my legs, Jimbo.

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:26.433
My legs feel like the floor's started
moving from under me.

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:31.069

Whatever happens, man, we gonna end up rich.

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:46.875
But dead, man.

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:50.230
There ain't no better way.

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:02.356
You take care, brother.

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.791
Hiya, boys.

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:32.314
- Hiya, Stenner.
- Captain, how are you?

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.709

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.396

No, I haven't seen any guy like this.

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:08.439
- Thought they might be friends of yours.
- No.

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:12.835
They all look alike to me.

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:15.036
Yeah, I thought you'd say that.

Son of a bitch.

You know what we done to

You know what we done to
that nigger creep, huh?

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:50.308

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:53.073

let's see you laugh.

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:18.596
Are you laughing?

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:27.514
Come over here. I wanna talk to you.

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.435
You're not talking, are you?

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:37.150
Hey, you wanna see a pretty picture?
You wanna see a pretty scene, huh?

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:41.869
You wanna see some pretty scenery?
Take him over here. Here!

01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:54.916
Put him overthe edge.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.150
That's it.

01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:59.834
Stay right there. Stay right there.

01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:03.229
Now who was it? Tell me who it was.

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:07.550
You think I get any kicks out of
wiping you out?

01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:11.110
You see any horns up here?
There are no horns. We're not animals.

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:13.712
Tie his legs, tie his legs good.

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:16.678
We're trying to be friends, that's all.

01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:22.596
If you don't tell me who it was, you're gonna
make me do something that I don't like.

01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:24.875
You're gonna make me feel very bad.

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:28.350
You're not gonna tell me?
You're not gonna tell me?

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:32.272
Hoist him.

01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.316
No!

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:37.716
Look at that. Can you fly? Huh?

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:41.588
Yeah. Yeah, Look at that, look at that.

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:44.831
Why should you take a drop 20 storeys...

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:47.516

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:51.559
We're gonna find out. We found Henry J.
We found you here.

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:54.436
Who was it, Joe? Oryou drop.

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:04.428
- Hold it.
- Wait a minute!

01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:06.590
Come here. No, it's all right.

01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:09.990
Just tell me, baby,
and everything will be all right.

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:14.230
That's all right, just tell me. Who was it?

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:17.198
- Who?
- Jim... Harris.

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:19.191
Who? Harris? Jim Harris?

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:24.476
All right, sweetheart. All right, sweetheart.

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:29.030
Jim Harris.

01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:53.076
Hello?

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:56.997
My medicine. Where the hell did I put my pills?

01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:59.913
I remember. Go back to the room. I'm coming.

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:10.989
There goes Harris's broad.
She's gonna take us right to him.

01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:25.756
Jim?

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:29.676
Gloria.

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.789
Glori...

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:37.839
- It's all right.
- After all that planning...

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:39.876
I forgot my medicine.

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:44.073
- It's all right.
- Gloria...

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:47.550
Darling, it's all right, don't talk.

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:50.200
I ain't never gonna leave you alone again.

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:53.430
Right there.

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:56.159
637 Lennox Avenue.

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:59.516
He's holed up on the fifth floor
of the empty tenement.

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:01.875
- Is the girl still in there?
- Right.

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:04.076
Lucky son of a bitch.

01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:13.000
Hey, Pope, can I see you a second?

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:19.636
Come in, will you?

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:25.156
It's been a long goddamn night.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.036
Pope, I want to talk to you.

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:31.953
I want you to understand...

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:35.555
Do you want a drink?

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:38.555
No, I don't drink.

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:41.350
You will, Pope. You will.

01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:51.875
Monday I'll give you all the facts,
names and figures.

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:54.793
- ljust don't...
- Wait a minute. Why?

01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:58.716
Cos I'm 55.

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:01.796
Put in 33 years, and...

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:04.910
I think it's time to quit.

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:12.679
I want to retire.
And I don't want you to use anything...

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:17.869
- I want you to stop patronising me.
- What are you talking about?

01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:25.595
You really are a racist son of a bitch.

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:27.352
Will you cut out that racist crap?

01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:30.591
Because I'm black,
I'm gonna blow the whistle on you?

01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:33.194
- You want my job, don't you?
- Yes!

01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:35.194
Yes.

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:38.996
Not like that, Mattelli.

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:42.796
I want it on my terms.

01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:51.276
- ljust thought that...
- When are you gonna start looking at me as a cop?

01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:58.876
Mattelli here.

01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:02.749
Hey, hey, Pope. Hold it.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:07.031
It's foryou.

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:13.993
Pope here.

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:16.435
If you use this right what I'm gonna tell you,

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:19.318
you can be detective first grade in a month.

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:21.516
You've got five seconds. Say it.

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:25.237
Move fast and you can get Harris.

01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:29.552
He's holed up in the fifth floor
of the empty tenement at 637 Lennox Avenue.

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:40.554
He's trying to suck us into something.

01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:42.710
He's telling you you're in and I'm out.

01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:49.029
Pope, the bill comes later.

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:51.554
Screw him. I won't pay it.

01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:55.277
Branco, Jeffries, Brooks, let's go!

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:59.353
- Harris is holed up at 637 Lennox Avenue.
- I guess that's TPF.

01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:03.991
Get flak vests, sharpshooters,
tear gas, the whole goddamn thing.

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:07.995
All right...

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.309
Captain.

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:15.470
Are you coming?

01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:01.435
Jim? Jim, are you asleep?

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:06.436
Jim?

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:10.513
Dead men hate soup.

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:14.036
- Faker.
- Need love.

01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:16.711
- Make love with me.
- No.

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:19.436
I'll keep in touch.

01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:25.879
Save your dime. I'm going to bed.

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:28.994
I already know how it's gonna turn out.

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:41.276
We are gonna make it, ain't we?

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:47.356
Yeah.

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:51.796
We're gonna make it.

01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:54.917
If we only could.
We will.

01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:57.756
Maybe we still can.

01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:34.751
Jamaica.

01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:37.593
- Jamaica?
- That's where we're going.

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:42.031
I don't even have my bathing suit.
But that's OK.

01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:56.550
We're gonna find us
a place high in the mountains,

01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:58.676
near a stream of water.

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:02.076
Maybe a lake.

01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:07.590
Then I'm gonna cut my own logs

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:12.277
and build us a little hut
with my own two hands.

01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:15.995
We'll have a cow,

01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:20.039
a couple of pigs, and some wild turkeys.

01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:24.196
- Baby turtles? I've always wanted a pet turtle.
- Mm?

01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:28.874
- I'll grow carrots in my garden forthem.
- What?

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.916
Carrots in my garden forthem.

01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:36.435
All right, Harris, this is the police!

01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:39.956
Come out with your hands up
and there won't be any trouble.

01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:54.154
I'm gonna give you three seconds!

01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:59.116
Harris, you got three seconds!

01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:01.918
One...

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:04.638
two...

01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:07.158
three!

01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:14.037
Aah!

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:20.275
Aah!

01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:31.554
Start the car! Start the car!

01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:00.796
Aah!

01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:12.995
Keep your cover and hold yourfire.

01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:17.074
Mattelli, get down.

01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:20.196
Get down.

01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:03.235
