Sign up in the foyer
and be sure to show it.

00:11.261 --> 00:13.430
So it took me all night,
but I finally figured out

00:13.513 --> 00:16.224
how to project our backdrop
for the talent show tomorrow.

00:16.308 --> 00:19.019
Great, except we're not doing
the cosplay stage fight thing anymore.

00:19.102 --> 00:21.229
Wait, what? Why not?

00:21.938 --> 00:24.316
It's a talent show raising money
for victims of a terrorist attack.

00:24.399 --> 00:27.402
Can't exactly bring fake weapons on stage.
So insensitive.

00:27.485 --> 00:28.486
Okay, but it's tomorrow.

00:28.570 --> 00:29.862
-What are we gonna do instead?
-[Baaz] Don't worry.

We had a flash of genius
in the bathroom this morning.

"Symphony of Farts."

00:34.909 --> 00:36.661
-Excuse me?
-We light our farts on fire.

00:36.744 --> 00:39.206
In time with the finale
of "Ride of the Valkyries."

00:39.289 --> 00:40.915
Oh, yeah, because that makes it so classy.

00:40.998 --> 00:42.709
I told you she wouldn't like it.

00:42.792 --> 00:43.918
Wait, why... why would you assume that?

00:44.001 --> 00:45.795
-Because you're a girl.
-No, it's because it's gross.

00:45.878 --> 00:47.630
But you find it gross
because you're a girl.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.550
No, me finding farts gross literally
has nothing to do with my genitals

00:50.633 --> 00:52.802
and everything to do with the fact
that they're disgusting.

00:52.885 --> 00:54.304
Lola!

00:54.387 --> 00:55.763
How do you feel about farts?

00:55.847 --> 00:58.308
-Oh, they're hilarious.
-See? Also, really?

00:58.391 --> 01:00.893
Yeah! They come out of your butt
and they make a funny sound.

01:02.354 --> 01:05.273
-I still think it's a terrible idea.
-Yeah, because you're a girl.

01:05.357 --> 01:06.816
Stop saying that!

01:06.899 --> 01:08.901
[Hunter] Guys and girls just find
different things funny.

01:08.985 --> 01:11.529
-Except for Lola.
-Yeah, I'm an enigma.

01:11.613 --> 01:14.741
You still can't assume everything about
anybody just because of their gender.

01:14.824 --> 01:16.743
Fine. Then I'll just assume
you're a no-fun killjoy

01:16.826 --> 01:17.869

to support you.

use a different bathroom,

06:32.141 --> 06:33.350

can come with depression and anxiety,

-So you don't want to kiss her?

-[stutters] Well, no!
-Come on, you're human.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.970
Hey, where have you been?
I've been texting you.

09:14.053 --> 09:15.304
Yeah, I'm sorry. I was in class.

09:16.681 --> 09:20.184
Um, I just had the weirdest conversation
with Grell.

09:20.267 --> 09:23.563
She wanted to know
if I wanted to be a dude.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.106
Like, if I was trans.

09:25.189 --> 09:28.943
Isn't that so offensive?
Like I'd wanna be more like you dummies.

09:29.026 --> 09:31.988
-[bell ringing]
-I gotta get to math.

09:32.071 --> 09:34.741
Yeah, I know. We're in the same class.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.035
What's wrong with him?

09:39.078 --> 09:40.246
What's wrong with you?

09:40.329 --> 09:43.499
-Baaz, don't do this right now.
-Do what?

09:43.583 --> 09:47.503
The no-boobs thing, the armpit hair,
the bathroom thing...

09:47.587 --> 09:49.213
Plus, you don't ever
wanna make out anymore.

09:49.296 --> 09:52.383
-Wait, Hunter said that?
-He was very distraught.

09:52.466 --> 09:54.636
So, if you're not trans, what are you?

09:54.719 --> 09:57.013
-A lesbian?
-Which wouldn't be a bad thing.

09:57.096 --> 09:59.473
-No! Of course not, but--
-Well, is that what he thinks?

09:59.556 --> 10:01.934
[Vijay] He's confused.
[Baaz] Because you're being confusing.

10:02.018 --> 10:05.605
So sort yourself out, or at least
put the poor guy out of his misery.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.074
[sighs]

10:23.205 --> 10:25.124
I know it sucks
that you didn't get into a school,

10:25.207 --> 10:27.960
but there's a ton of community college
programs that sound awesome.

10:28.711 --> 10:31.839
Why don't we ditch class
and get our hands on some beers?

10:31.923 --> 10:34.383
[chuckles] No way, dude. I've got a test.

10:34.466 --> 10:36.678
And if we're still
in the same history class, so do you.

10:36.761 --> 10:39.055
-[sighs]
-Hey, it's okay.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.264
We'll figure it out.

10:40.347 --> 10:42.433
[sighs] I think I'm in the process
of being broken up with.

10:42.516 --> 10:44.226
Of course this is about Esme.

10:44.310 --> 10:47.104
I think she thinks
something's going on with Frankie.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.648
-Is there?
-No.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.150
I think she's just assuming the worst.

10:51.233 --> 10:53.527
Ah, maybe it's inevitable.

10:53.610 --> 10:54.987
I mean, you're going to CalTech,

10:55.071 --> 10:57.031
Esme's going to whatever
fancy school she wants,

10:57.114 --> 10:58.908
and I'm just a loser with no future.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.409
Well, I'm trying to
help you out with that.

11:02.494 --> 11:05.497
Maybe if she sees that I've got a plan,
she won't break up with me.

11:05.581 --> 11:08.000
Um, that's not really why
I was suggesting this,

11:08.084 --> 11:11.713
but sure, whatever gets you
signing those applications.

11:25.559 --> 11:27.353
Okay, so, you know, I've been thinking.

11:27.436 --> 11:30.356
I think farts are funny
because they're a surprise.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.739
I'm really sorry.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.866
-It's okay.
-[sighs]

11:41.826 --> 11:45.997
I was just trying to see if...
[inhales deeply] I'm gay.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.834
-And?
-No, I don't think I am.

11:49.917 --> 11:52.003
Okay! Glad I could help.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.255
[sighs] Then what is wrong with me?

11:54.338 --> 11:56.173
-Sorry, I'm really confused.
-Me, too!

11:57.091 --> 11:58.300
[sighs]

12:02.138 --> 12:05.432
I feel... in between.

12:05.516 --> 12:08.685
I don't feel like a girl
or what everyone thinks is a girl.

12:08.770 --> 12:11.272
I don't like makeup and stuff like you do.

12:11.355 --> 12:13.816
I really, really hate my boobs.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.943
Yeah, I... I was wondering
what was going on there.

12:16.027 --> 12:18.279
But I don't feel like a boy, either.

12:18.362 --> 12:20.531
And I'm definitely not gay.

12:20.614 --> 12:22.241
I like Hunter.

12:22.324 --> 12:24.243
-This sounds familiar.
-What?

12:24.326 --> 12:26.162
You're like... [chuckles]
the girliest girl I know.

12:26.245 --> 12:29.290
No, not me! My favorite vlogger did
a thing about this.

12:29.373 --> 12:30.833
They identify as genderqueer.

12:30.917 --> 12:34.378
Or, I think there's another name for it.
Um... Gender fluid.

12:34.461 --> 12:38.674
They feel like they're between
a boy or girl. Or both. Or neither.

12:38.757 --> 12:40.802
-Does that make sense?
-No.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.053
Okay, it's like...

12:43.220 --> 12:48.392
If being a boy or a girl is made up,
then you can be whatever you want, right?

12:48.475 --> 12:49.643
There, that's them.

12:53.314 --> 12:54.523
I think this calls for a makeover.

12:54.606 --> 12:56.358
Lola, not everything calls for a makeover.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.069
You have never been more wrong.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.821
Okay, look, just tell me
what you'd want to look like

12:59.904 --> 13:01.488
if you weren't worrying about
being a boy or a girl.

Well, most people like you
use different pronouns.

-Like "ze," instead of "he" or "she."
-Why?

I guess, if you're not all boy

that you posted.

18:49.378 --> 18:53.006
Oh, "Last Exit?" Yeah. Um...

18:54.007 --> 18:56.718
I don't know. I wasn't in a great place
when I wrote that song

18:56.802 --> 19:00.931
and I was worried it would make people...
kill themselves.

19:01.014 --> 19:03.434
I get it. I went through
some pretty scary stuff, too.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.061
But you know what? Songs like that helped.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.938
They let me know that I wasn't alone.

19:08.021 --> 19:10.941
Yeah, that your thoughts weren't wrong

-No, I'm asking you to come meet with us,

play a few more songs,

to be up there.

21:42.050 --> 21:43.344
he'll come around.

21:44.386 --> 21:46.096
But I'm not going back.

she didn't break up with me.

I kind of have two girlfriends now.

at Frankie's house, and, uh...

22:22.173 --> 22:25.802
some stuff happened.
