WEBVTT

02:49.922 --> 02:51.455
Burn them all!

02:51.557 --> 02:53.023
Where's my sister?

02:54.994 --> 02:56.794
Burn them all!

03:27.326 --> 03:28.659
Please.

03:41.507 --> 03:43.740
Burn them. Burn them all!

03:57.590 --> 04:00.123
<i>Burn them all!</i>

04:08.367 --> 04:11.201
Meera.

04:11.303 --> 04:13.270
They found us.

04:20.512 --> 04:23.447
I'm so sorry.

05:27.613 --> 05:29.046
Come with me, now.

05:34.053 --> 05:36.386
The dead don't rest.

06:02.214 --> 06:03.914
It's so green.

06:04.016 --> 06:05.682
Oh, yes.

06:05.784 --> 06:07.584
Once you get south of the Riverlands,

06:07.686 --> 06:10.587
very different sorts of
trees start to take over.

06:10.689 --> 06:14.391
Maple, Elm, Beech, Poplar.

06:17.963 --> 06:19.863
The odd Willow.

06:19.965 --> 06:22.432
And of course now that summer's over,

06:22.534 --> 06:25.335
you'll start seeing the
autumn colors coming in.

06:27.806 --> 06:31.842
Still, you'll find more green
here than anywhere else.

06:31.944 --> 06:35.612
You're nervous.
You're a nervous talker.

06:40.419 --> 06:42.819
That's not any better
being a nervous mute.

06:42.921 --> 06:45.389
I didn't think
I'd ever come back here

06:45.491 --> 06:47.758
after my father made me
renounce my title

06:47.860 --> 06:49.726
and inheritance

06:49.828 --> 06:52.262
and, well, threaten
to kill me if I didn't.

06:53.832 --> 06:56.199
A person just doesn't
feel welcome at that point.

06:58.270 --> 07:01.505
And I certainly didn't expect to
be introducing him to my family.

07:02.975 --> 07:05.442
So you know what to tell them.

07:05.544 --> 07:07.411
That Little Sam is your baby.

07:07.513 --> 07:09.079
Yes, now that's very important.

07:09.181 --> 07:11.681
If he thinks that
Little Sam is his grandchild,

07:11.784 --> 07:13.650
he'll take you in.

07:13.752 --> 07:17.154
He'll get an education.
He'll learn to read.

07:17.256 --> 07:20.157
And you can help teach him. Huh?

07:20.259 --> 07:23.193
What did you tell
your family about me?

07:26.665 --> 07:29.066
I told them I met you in the North.

07:29.168 --> 07:31.034
Did you tell them how far north?

07:31.136 --> 07:34.237
Well, it wasn't a very
large piece of parchment.

07:34.339 --> 07:36.019
You didn't tell them
where I'm really from?

07:36.108 --> 07:37.908
You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?

07:38.010 --> 07:40.110
The thing is...

07:40.212 --> 07:42.546
my father doesn't like wildlings.

07:42.648 --> 07:47.017
He hoped I'd make a man of myself
by "killing some bloody wildlings,"

07:47.119 --> 07:50.687
so it's probably a good subject
to avoid if at all possible.

07:53.559 --> 07:55.926
I think we're here.

08:25.424 --> 08:26.690
Sam.

08:26.792 --> 08:29.025
Oh, Sam.

08:29.128 --> 08:31.261
Oh, hello, Mother.

08:33.966 --> 08:35.932
I never thought I'd see you again.

08:36.034 --> 08:38.635
- You look wonderful.
- Oh.

08:41.539 --> 08:42.873
Talla?

08:42.975 --> 08:45.742
Gods, you're a woman now.

08:45.844 --> 08:48.311
Father says I have
to marry Symun Fossoway.

08:48.413 --> 08:51.448
- He has yellow teeth...
- That's enough, Talla.

08:53.485 --> 08:57.821
Oh, um, Mother, this is Gilly.

09:00.092 --> 09:02.359
Oh, my.

09:02.461 --> 09:04.561
You are lovely.

09:06.532 --> 09:09.065
I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly.

09:12.371 --> 09:15.238
Oh, and this,

09:15.340 --> 09:17.741
this is our son Samwell.

09:22.581 --> 09:25.782
Hello, little one.

09:25.884 --> 09:29.252
It's me, your grandmother.

09:31.023 --> 09:32.455
May I hold him?

09:32.558 --> 09:34.457
Yes, of course.

09:38.497 --> 09:40.363
Oh.

09:40.465 --> 09:42.899
You have a curious mind, I can tell.

09:43.001 --> 09:46.269
You'll be a scholar like your father.

09:46.371 --> 09:50.407
Where is Father?
And Dickon?

09:50.509 --> 09:52.342
They're on a hunt.

09:53.545 --> 09:55.579
<i>They'll join us for dinner.</i>

09:55.681 --> 09:59.015
Come inside.
Such a journey.

09:59.117 --> 10:00.817
You must be exhausted.

10:00.919 --> 10:04.287
Come, you'll be wanting a
bath after all that travel.

10:04.389 --> 10:06.489
Oh, and a dress for dinner.

10:06.592 --> 10:08.258
You can wear one of mine.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.193
What's your color?

10:10.295 --> 10:12.662
Midnight blue or silver?

10:12.764 --> 10:14.864
Silver, maybe.
Come.

10:14.967 --> 10:17.334
You can choose one of my
bedrooms if you want.

10:26.345 --> 10:28.878
Is there no other way?

10:28.981 --> 10:30.547
You're afraid for her?

10:30.649 --> 10:33.416
Of course I'm afraid for her!

10:35.988 --> 10:39.589
It just seems very dangerous.

10:39.691 --> 10:42.125
She'll be protected the entire way.

10:42.227 --> 10:44.794
The Faith Militant are very stern

10:44.896 --> 10:47.497
with those who overstep their bounds.

10:49.334 --> 10:52.902
And Queen Margaery isn't your mother.

10:53.005 --> 10:55.939
I suspect the gods will
predispose the common people

10:56.041 --> 10:58.575
to gentleness on her behalf.

10:58.677 --> 11:01.144
She's truly opened her heart to them.

11:01.246 --> 11:05.015
She's always been very devoted
to the poor and the unfortunate.

11:05.117 --> 11:07.951
And now she's devoted
to the gods as well.

11:10.155 --> 11:12.389
Would you like to see her?

11:33.745 --> 11:35.478
Have they hurt you?

11:35.580 --> 11:36.980
Have they mistreated you?

11:37.082 --> 11:40.150
- No, Your Grace.
- I've missed you.

11:40.252 --> 11:41.951
More than you could know.

11:42.054 --> 11:44.220
We'll be together again soon

11:44.323 --> 11:47.057
and everything will be
better than it was before.

11:47.159 --> 11:49.092
Better how?

11:49.194 --> 11:50.560
Soon the...

11:53.031 --> 11:54.831
walk of atonement.

11:56.335 --> 11:58.468
He says there's no other way.

11:58.570 --> 12:01.671
Have you spoken to him at
all, the High Sparrow?

12:01.773 --> 12:05.141
Yes, a few times.

12:05.243 --> 12:06.576
Have you?

12:06.678 --> 12:08.178
Yes, I have.

12:08.280 --> 12:10.947
He's not quite what we
thought he was, is he?

12:12.484 --> 12:15.218
You think I'm mad.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.387
I sound mad.

12:17.489 --> 12:19.422
No.
No, you don't.

12:19.524 --> 12:21.558
You...
you could never.

12:21.660 --> 12:23.326
You're right, he's not.

12:23.428 --> 12:25.128
He's a lot more...

12:25.230 --> 12:26.763
He is.

12:26.865 --> 12:28.965
There's something about him.

12:29.067 --> 12:31.134
His way of looking at the world.

12:33.505 --> 12:38.675
It's not an easy thing admitting
to yourself what you really are.

12:38.777 --> 12:40.710
It's taken me a while.

12:40.812 --> 12:42.846
He's helped me.

12:42.948 --> 12:44.848
What are you talking about?

12:44.950 --> 12:49.285
You're a good person. You've
always been a good person.

12:49.388 --> 12:52.555
You're the best person I know.

12:52.657 --> 12:55.658
I was just telling him about
your devotion to the poor.

12:55.761 --> 12:57.560
Ah, yes, I visited their hovels

12:57.662 --> 13:01.064
and I fed them soup and I made
sure I was seen doing it.

13:02.501 --> 13:05.869
I never gave them what
they really needed, though.

13:05.971 --> 13:10.640
I've had lots of time to think about
how good I was at seeming good.

13:12.244 --> 13:14.844
All those stories I told
myself about who I was

13:14.946 --> 13:17.580
and why I did the things I did.

13:18.817 --> 13:21.484
There were so many lies
in those stories.

13:23.288 --> 13:24.988
I don't understand.

13:25.090 --> 13:27.257
It's all right.
It really is.

13:27.359 --> 13:30.827
It's such a relief
to let go of those lies.

13:35.901 --> 13:37.767
What about Loras?

13:39.704 --> 13:41.304
I love my brother.

13:41.406 --> 13:45.241
I will always love my brother.

13:45.343 --> 13:49.646
His soul is pure and perfect.

13:49.748 --> 13:52.248
His sins don't erase that purity,

13:52.350 --> 13:54.384
they only obscure it.

13:54.486 --> 13:58.888
He just needs to atone for them.

14:00.125 --> 14:01.424
We all do.

14:01.526 --> 14:04.727
Sooner or later, one way or another.

14:06.064 --> 14:09.098
The gods have a plan for us all.

14:24.449 --> 14:27.283
It's hard to walk in this.

14:29.488 --> 14:31.387
It's beautiful.

14:33.258 --> 14:35.058
You're beautiful.

15:22.240 --> 15:26.109
This venison, it's very tasty.

15:26.211 --> 15:28.745
Is it from today's hunt?

15:28.847 --> 15:30.747
Well, no.

15:30.849 --> 15:32.782
We haven't been able
to cure that one yet.

15:32.884 --> 15:34.784
<i>This is last week's.</i>

15:34.886 --> 15:38.421
Oh, of course.
Sorry.

15:38.523 --> 15:40.490
Long journey.

15:40.592 --> 15:43.092
Brought it down from 70 yards.

15:43.194 --> 15:44.794
One shot.

15:44.896 --> 15:48.331
Oh, that's a fair distance.

15:48.433 --> 15:51.301
So do you do much hunting
up at the Wall?

15:51.403 --> 15:54.070
Oh, yes.
Yes.

15:54.172 --> 15:55.738
A good amount.

15:56.908 --> 15:58.474
North of the Wall,

15:58.577 --> 16:00.710
you don't hunt, you don't eat.

16:00.812 --> 16:02.278
Mm-hmm.

16:02.380 --> 16:04.247
Mostly deer or is it elk as well?

16:05.750 --> 16:07.951
Rabbits.

16:08.053 --> 16:10.320
<i>Sometimes squirrels.</i>

16:13.525 --> 16:17.327
I say "We," it's my
friend Jon mostly.

16:17.429 --> 16:19.228
Sometimes Edd.

16:19.331 --> 16:20.997
<i>Oh, and Gilly.</i>

16:21.099 --> 16:24.067
She's... she's quite
a good hunter as well.

16:25.103 --> 16:27.403
Um, huntress.

16:27.505 --> 16:29.706
<i>I imagine it's common where you're from.</i>

16:29.808 --> 16:33.242
We once met a man, Lord Umber from
Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll,

16:33.345 --> 16:35.578
<i>who said he taught all
his daughters how to hunt.</i>

16:35.680 --> 16:38.181
Your father taught you to hunt?

16:38.283 --> 16:40.116
Our father would never teach us.

16:40.218 --> 16:44.220
I think our father could learn a
thing or two from your father.

16:44.322 --> 16:45.622
That's enough of that.

16:49.094 --> 16:50.660
Samwell, would you care
for more bread?

16:50.762 --> 16:53.730
Oh, yes.
Yes, please.

16:53.832 --> 16:55.398
Thank you, Mother.

16:59.504 --> 17:01.638
Not fat enough already?

17:13.585 --> 17:16.419
I travelled south under orders
from the Lord Commander.

17:16.521 --> 17:18.755
- He wants me to...
- I read your letter.

17:20.592 --> 17:22.558
You're to be a maester.

17:22.661 --> 17:23.992
Yes.

17:24.095 --> 17:25.862
And once I have my chain,

17:25.964 --> 17:28.464
I'll return to Castle Black.

17:28.566 --> 17:31.768
I thought the Night's Watch
might make a man of you.

17:33.371 --> 17:35.571
Something resembling a man at least.

17:36.975 --> 17:40.510
You managed to stay soft and fat.

17:42.414 --> 17:45.014
Your nose buried in books.

17:45.116 --> 17:49.552
Spending your life reading about
the achievements of better men.

17:49.654 --> 17:53.122
I'll wager you still can't sit
a horse or wield a sword.

17:53.224 --> 17:56.325
Randyll, to be maester of the
Night's Watch is a great honor.

17:56.428 --> 17:58.761
He can wield a sword.

18:00.131 --> 18:02.198
He killed a Thenn.

18:04.035 --> 18:05.435
He killed a white walker.

18:05.537 --> 18:08.938
There's no such thing.

18:10.709 --> 18:14.077
I saw it with my own eyes on
our way down to Castle Black.

18:14.179 --> 18:17.814
He drove a dagger
into the walker's heart.

18:17.916 --> 18:21.417
He risked his own life
to save mine more than once.

18:21.519 --> 18:25.121
He's a greater warrior than
either of you will ever be.

18:27.459 --> 18:30.460
Your way down to Castle Black?

18:33.364 --> 18:35.531
<i>Where did he kill a white walker?</i>

18:38.036 --> 18:40.236
Where are you from?

18:40.338 --> 18:42.672
How'd you come to meet my son?

18:44.843 --> 18:47.176
The Night's Watch came to our keep.

18:47.278 --> 18:49.278
- Where?
- Gilly.

18:49.380 --> 18:51.547
- North of the Wall.
- <i>North of the Wall?</i>

18:55.787 --> 18:58.020
You're a wildling.

19:05.263 --> 19:09.432
The Seven Kingdoms have waged war
against these savages for centuries

19:09.534 --> 19:13.069
and here I sit hosting one in my hall

19:13.171 --> 19:16.272
<i>thanks to my son.</i>

19:18.543 --> 19:20.042
See that sword?

19:22.947 --> 19:25.848
It's called Heartsbane.

19:25.950 --> 19:29.652
It's been in our family
for 500 years.

19:29.754 --> 19:31.821
<i>It's Valyrian steel.</i>

19:31.923 --> 19:34.390
<i>Only a handful of them
left in the world.</i>

19:34.492 --> 19:38.361
It's supposed to go to my
firstborn son after I die.

19:38.463 --> 19:40.096
To him.

19:41.366 --> 19:44.767
He will never wield that sword.

19:44.869 --> 19:48.971
If he were to become
Lord Tarly of Horn Hill,

19:49.073 --> 19:51.374
it would be the end of this house.

19:54.045 --> 19:57.013
I took you for a Mole's
Town whore when I saw you

19:57.115 --> 19:58.681
and I made my peace with that.

19:58.783 --> 20:00.550
Who else would have him?

20:02.453 --> 20:04.120
But I overestimated him.

20:05.657 --> 20:07.390
<i>No.</i>

20:09.194 --> 20:13.329
It was a wildling whore
that seduced my son.

20:15.533 --> 20:17.600
This you getting back at me, boy?

20:19.871 --> 20:23.940
Hmm? Bringing that to my table
and making me dine with it?

20:26.411 --> 20:28.845
<i>And you got what you
were after, didn't you?</i>

20:28.947 --> 20:33.216
A bastard.
A half-breed bastard.

20:33.318 --> 20:35.885
Your invitation into our home.

20:35.987 --> 20:39.021
Come, my dear.
Talla.

20:40.225 --> 20:42.191
I've lost my appetite.

20:42.293 --> 20:43.659
He dishonors us.

20:43.761 --> 20:46.629
You dishonor yourself.

20:50.535 --> 20:54.003
Your mother's a fine woman.
You're not worthy of her.

20:56.708 --> 21:01.110
To please her, I'll take the wildling in.
She can work in the kitchens.

21:01.212 --> 21:04.213
The bastard will be raised here.

21:07.085 --> 21:10.620
But this will be the last night
you ever spend at Horn Hill.

21:18.396 --> 21:21.597
I'm sorry I let him
treat you that way.

21:21.699 --> 21:25.067
I was afraid he'd turn
you and Little Sam away.

21:25.169 --> 21:28.070
I'm not angry at you.

21:28.172 --> 21:30.206
I'm angry that horrible people

21:30.308 --> 21:32.808
can treat good people that
way and get away with it.

21:38.383 --> 21:40.349
When do you have to go?

21:43.421 --> 21:45.354
First light.

21:56.267 --> 21:57.733
Say good-bye
to him for me.

22:06.010 --> 22:09.111
You're not what
he thinks you are, Sam.

22:09.213 --> 22:11.681
He doesn't know what you are.

22:15.086 --> 22:17.019
Good-bye, Gilly.

23:01.399 --> 23:03.232
- Sam?
- We're leaving.

23:03.334 --> 23:05.167
- What?
- Get your things.

23:05.269 --> 23:08.304
I don't have any things.

23:08.406 --> 23:11.240
- What are you doing?
- We belong together.

23:11.342 --> 23:13.242
All of us.

23:13.344 --> 23:15.878
What about your mother and sister?

23:15.980 --> 23:17.913
Oh, they'll understand.

23:18.016 --> 23:19.682
Your sister's dress.

23:19.784 --> 23:21.650
She won't mind.

23:23.588 --> 23:25.454
Looks better on you anyway.

23:25.556 --> 23:27.523
Sam.

23:27.625 --> 23:29.692
That's your father's sword.

23:29.794 --> 23:31.827
It's my family's sword.

23:36.634 --> 23:38.401
Sam.

23:38.503 --> 23:41.003
Won't he come for it?

23:42.640 --> 23:44.807
He can bloody well try.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.247
The lion and the rose are one.

23:51.349 --> 23:53.382
I thank the gods above.

23:53.484 --> 23:55.985
And to you, my beauteous bride,

23:56.087 --> 23:58.120
I pledge undying love.

23:58.222 --> 24:02.525
Hail King Joffrey.
Hail Queen Margaery.

24:02.627 --> 24:05.261
I'll drink a toast to my new queen,

24:05.363 --> 24:07.696
for there is no one fairer.

24:07.799 --> 24:12.001
Dear Uncle, will you share my
joy and be my royal cupbearer?

24:12.103 --> 24:14.870
Drink long and deep, my noble king,

24:14.972 --> 24:17.206
from this cup of sweet wine.

24:17.308 --> 24:19.842
The last drink he shall ever take.

24:19.944 --> 24:21.877
And vengeance shall be mine.

24:33.491 --> 24:35.691
Poison!

24:35.793 --> 24:37.560
Murder!

24:37.662 --> 24:40.062
I gasp.
I... I die.

24:42.500 --> 24:45.000
I limp.

24:45.103 --> 24:47.236
And it was he...

24:47.338 --> 24:50.439
<i>...that poisoned me.</i>

24:50.541 --> 24:53.442
My evil Uncle Imp.

24:59.817 --> 25:01.250
Calm down, dear.

25:05.623 --> 25:07.590
My firstborn son.

25:07.692 --> 25:10.092
My golden lion

25:10.194 --> 25:12.695
foully, falsely slain.

25:14.332 --> 25:16.966
I pray you found a lasting peace

25:17.068 --> 25:19.235
free from strife and pain.

25:21.706 --> 25:23.973
Hear my prayer, O cruel gods.

25:24.075 --> 25:25.908
<i>Take my life instead.</i>

25:26.010 --> 25:29.879
For I cannot face another day
when my sweet boy is dead.

25:29.981 --> 25:32.882
<i>Oh, woe.</i>

25:32.984 --> 25:34.950
Oh, grief.

25:36.454 --> 25:39.722
Oh, darkest day,
my heart is full of sorrow.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.660
All hope is lost.

25:45.963 --> 25:47.796
All joy is gone.

25:51.035 --> 25:53.903
And there is no tomorrow.

26:13.958 --> 26:16.525
What is that I hear and smell?

26:16.627 --> 26:19.295
<i>Someone I'll soon send to hell.</i>

26:19.397 --> 26:21.964
It's time to see if truth they told

26:22.066 --> 26:25.701
who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.

26:27.939 --> 26:29.905
You beast.
You beast.

26:30.007 --> 26:34.843
You killed my wife and now
you've taken your father's life.

26:34.946 --> 26:37.713
<i>No worse child
ever stained this land.</i>

26:37.815 --> 26:40.316
Curse the day I named you.

26:49.694 --> 26:53.395
My greatest crime.
Now I must flee.

26:53.497 --> 26:56.298
<i>Then sail across the Narrow Sea</i>

26:56.400 --> 27:00.536
<i>to do unto you more treachery.</i>

27:00.638 --> 27:04.340
Don't fear winter.
Fear me!

27:08.379 --> 27:10.212
<i>Thank you.</i>

27:10.314 --> 27:13.882
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Bianca,</i>

27:13.985 --> 27:15.918
<i>Clarenzo.</i>

27:16.020 --> 27:19.655
I give you Bobono.

27:19.757 --> 27:22.191
I give you Camello.

27:22.293 --> 27:24.560
<i>And last but not least,</i>

27:24.662 --> 27:26.795
sweet Lady Crane.

27:38.142 --> 27:41.610
Give this a good beating. Shake
those fleas out. That's a dear.

27:41.712 --> 27:43.846
That crowd was shit.

27:48.252 --> 27:50.252
Girl.

27:50.354 --> 27:52.688
What are you doing back here?

27:52.790 --> 27:54.189
Nothing.

27:54.292 --> 27:57.660
I saw you the other day
in the audience.

27:57.762 --> 28:00.696
How many times have you
seen this stupid play?

28:02.633 --> 28:03.666
Three times.

28:03.768 --> 28:05.467
Did you pay?

28:05.569 --> 28:07.736
No.

28:11.242 --> 28:13.542
I remember when the players
came to my village.

28:13.644 --> 28:16.245
I didn't have any money,
so I snuck in.

28:16.347 --> 28:18.514
Just like you.

28:18.616 --> 28:20.716
Saw the painted faces, the costumes,

28:20.818 --> 28:22.384
listened to the songs,

28:22.486 --> 28:25.921
cried when the young lovers
died in each other's arms.

28:26.023 --> 28:29.792
I ran off and joined them the
next day, never looked back.

28:31.329 --> 28:32.728
You're very good.

28:32.830 --> 28:34.563
My final speech is shit.

28:34.665 --> 28:37.933
But to be fair to myself,
which I always like to be,

28:38.035 --> 28:40.269
the writing's no good.

28:40.371 --> 28:42.271
So change it.

28:43.974 --> 28:46.842
It would all just be farting,
belching, and slapping without you.

28:48.279 --> 28:50.412
How would you change it?

28:55.820 --> 28:59.021
The queen loves her son
more than anything.

28:59.123 --> 29:02.157
And he was taken from her
before she could say good-bye.

29:02.259 --> 29:04.259
She wouldn't just cry.

29:07.932 --> 29:10.766
She would be angry.

29:10.868 --> 29:13.435
She would want to kill the
person who did this to her.

29:17.641 --> 29:18.807
What's your name?

29:20.544 --> 29:22.644
Mercy.

29:22.747 --> 29:25.447
You have very expressive eyes, Mercy.

29:25.549 --> 29:28.117
<i>Wonderful eyebrows.</i>

29:29.420 --> 29:31.353
Do you like pretending
to be other people?

29:33.157 --> 29:35.824
I have to go. My
father's waiting for me.

29:44.001 --> 29:46.735
Lady Crane, they loved you.

29:46.837 --> 29:49.605
They were sweet.
Or drunk.

29:49.707 --> 29:51.774
Drunkenly sweet.

29:51.876 --> 29:53.442
No laugh for Ned's death.

29:53.544 --> 29:57.246
These people are worse than animals.

29:58.482 --> 30:01.150
But they loved her.
They all love her.

30:01.252 --> 30:05.020
Yes, you are adored
by people and animals alike.

30:05.122 --> 30:07.656
I do what I can with what I'm given.

30:07.758 --> 30:09.658
With what you're given?

30:09.760 --> 30:11.593
Well, I was thinking...

30:11.695 --> 30:13.195
<i>Oh, we're all thinkers now, are we?</i>

30:13.297 --> 30:16.098
Full to the tits with ideas.

30:16.200 --> 30:19.501
- I didn't mean...
- You have ideas, I have ideas,

30:19.603 --> 30:21.370
he has ideas.

30:21.472 --> 30:24.173
Why should my ideas have
any more value than yours

30:24.275 --> 30:27.576
simply because I've been
doing this my whole life?

30:27.678 --> 30:29.878
Who is anyone to judge my work?

30:29.980 --> 30:32.748
This is my profession.
I know what I'm doing.

30:32.850 --> 30:34.783
You have no right to an opinion.

30:48.098 --> 30:50.365
Careful of that one.

30:54.171 --> 30:56.238
She wants you dead.

31:35.513 --> 31:37.079
And?

31:37.181 --> 31:39.414
As I expected.

31:41.118 --> 31:42.851
A shame.

31:42.953 --> 31:44.953
A girl had many gifts.

31:47.958 --> 31:49.825
You promised me.

31:55.966 --> 31:58.000
Don't let her suffer.

32:49.420 --> 32:52.521
Company, halt!

32:53.791 --> 32:55.390
My lord.

32:55.492 --> 32:57.326
My lord.

32:58.963 --> 33:02.731
My friends, the hour has come.

33:02.833 --> 33:06.568
Madness has overtaken this city

33:06.670 --> 33:11.273
and grasped in its claws my children.

33:11.375 --> 33:14.543
But now we must drive it back

33:14.645 --> 33:17.713
under the rocks whence it came.

33:17.815 --> 33:22.351
Madness has had its day!

33:25.522 --> 33:27.856
<i>Forward, march!</i>

33:30.427 --> 33:34.162
Rich or poor, noble or common,

33:34.264 --> 33:38.433
if we sin, we must atone.

33:40.004 --> 33:42.504
Margaery of House Tyrell

33:42.606 --> 33:45.040
<i>came to us a sinner.</i>

33:45.142 --> 33:47.509
She stood before the gods

33:47.611 --> 33:50.078
in the holy sept and lied.

33:50.180 --> 33:53.215
She turned a blind eye
to her brother's sins.

33:53.317 --> 33:55.884
She disgraced her house,

33:55.986 --> 33:59.254
her king, and herself.

34:30.853 --> 34:32.721
<i>Company, halt!</i>

34:32.822 --> 34:35.090
Face front!

34:35.192 --> 34:36.925
Turn!

34:38.829 --> 34:41.596
<i>Lord Tyrell.</i>

34:41.699 --> 34:43.965
Ser Jaime.

34:44.068 --> 34:45.967
Sorry to interrupt.

34:46.070 --> 34:48.770
<i>We're here for Queen Margaery
and Ser Loras Tyrell.</i>

34:48.871 --> 34:52.139
Give them to us
and we'll be on our way.

34:52.242 --> 34:56.344
I don't have the authority
to give them to you.

34:56.447 --> 34:59.281
And you don't have
the authority to take them.

34:59.383 --> 35:01.216
That's right.

35:03.487 --> 35:04.653
Hyah.

35:09.927 --> 35:12.961
<i>Lock spears!</i>

35:13.063 --> 35:17.232
I speak for King Tommen of House
Baratheon, First of His Name.

35:17.334 --> 35:20.402
The gods don't recognize
his authority in this matter.

35:20.504 --> 35:23.238
You've already insulted
one great house.

35:23.340 --> 35:25.307
<i>It won't happen twice.</i>

35:25.409 --> 35:27.642
Every last sparrow will die

35:27.745 --> 35:30.212
before Margaery Tyrell
walks down that street.

35:30.314 --> 35:32.814
To die in the service of the gods

35:32.916 --> 35:35.117
would please
each and every one of us.

35:35.219 --> 35:37.552
We yearn for it.

35:46.597 --> 35:49.097
But there is no call for it today.

35:51.969 --> 35:54.970
There will be no walk of atonement.

36:11.355 --> 36:13.355
<i>Order up.</i>

36:13.457 --> 36:16.424
Queen Margaery has already
atoned for her sins

36:16.527 --> 36:19.528
<i>by bringing another</i>

36:19.630 --> 36:21.730
into the true light of the Seven.

36:51.728 --> 36:54.930
Together we announce

36:55.032 --> 36:57.566
<i>a new age of harmony.</i>

36:58.602 --> 37:00.535
A holy alliance

37:00.637 --> 37:04.172
between the Crown and the Faith.

37:19.323 --> 37:23.325
<i>Long live King Tommen
and bless you, Queen Margaery!</i>

37:23.427 --> 37:25.827
The Crown and the Faith

37:25.929 --> 37:29.664
are the twin pillars
upon which the world rests.

37:29.766 --> 37:34.870
Together we will restore
the Seven Kingdoms to glory.

37:53.257 --> 37:55.390
What's happening?

37:55.492 --> 37:57.492
He's beaten us.

37:57.594 --> 37:59.461
That's what's happening.

38:14.344 --> 38:17.345
When you attack the Faith,
you attack the Crown.

38:17.447 --> 38:20.415
Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit

38:20.517 --> 38:23.118
to serve as Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard.

38:23.220 --> 38:27.155
I've been a member of the Kingsguard
since before you were born.

38:29.059 --> 38:32.093
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to do anything.

38:34.498 --> 38:36.431
I have to answer to the gods.

38:36.533 --> 38:38.767
Not when you're sitting
in that chair.

38:42.906 --> 38:45.507
The Crown's decision
on this matter is final.

38:47.644 --> 38:50.578
Will I be walking naked
in the streets?

38:50.681 --> 38:53.181
Or will I spend a few months
in the sept dungeons first

38:53.283 --> 38:55.417
to teach me about the gods' mercy?

38:59.623 --> 39:03.925
You have served your house and your
king faithfully for many years.

39:04.027 --> 39:06.261
And you will continue to do so.

39:08.031 --> 39:09.965
But not in this city.

39:13.236 --> 39:16.604
You've lost it?

39:18.342 --> 39:19.641
Yes, Father.

39:19.743 --> 39:22.677
It's a castle, not a bloody sheep.

39:22.779 --> 39:25.947
Presumably you still
know where it is.

39:26.049 --> 39:27.649
You didn't lose Riverrun.

39:27.751 --> 39:29.884
You let the Blackfish
take it from you.

39:29.987 --> 39:32.954
He surprised us. He knows the
castle better than anyone.

39:33.056 --> 39:36.424
You did lose the Blackfish
after the Red Wedding.

39:36.526 --> 39:39.527
You had him right here in this
hall and you let him leave.

39:39.629 --> 39:42.130
Then when I told you to
hunt him down and kill him,

39:42.232 --> 39:43.598
you couldn't find him.

39:43.700 --> 39:45.800
That's what it means
to lose something.

39:45.902 --> 39:49.337
Now he's come back
and taken Riverrun.

39:49.439 --> 39:51.606
I don't think it's fair to blame us...

39:51.708 --> 39:54.976
For 300 years we kissed Tully boots,

39:55.078 --> 39:58.980
swore oaths to them and their
stinking fish banners.

39:59.082 --> 40:01.316
Not again.
Riverrun is ours.

40:01.418 --> 40:03.752
Take it back.

40:03.854 --> 40:05.387
We don't have the men.

40:05.489 --> 40:08.823
We've got 10 times as many
men as the damn Blackfish.

40:08.925 --> 40:11.960
<i>The Mallisters have
risen against us. And the Blackwoods.</i>

40:12.062 --> 40:15.263
<i>The Brotherhood Without Banners
is rallying the commoners against us,</i>

40:15.365 --> 40:17.298
<i>raiding our supply trains and camps.</i>

40:17.401 --> 40:20.435
<i>Riverrun can
withstand a siege for a year.</i>

40:20.537 --> 40:23.872
If I want excuses,
I'll put her in charge.

40:23.974 --> 40:25.740
They're laughing at us.

40:25.842 --> 40:27.709
All across the Riverlands

40:27.811 --> 40:29.544
right down to King's Landing,

40:29.646 --> 40:31.279
<i>they're laughing at us.</i>

40:31.381 --> 40:33.915
I hear it in my sleep!

40:34.017 --> 40:37.018
I'm not dead yet,
unfortunately for you.

40:37.120 --> 40:41.856
And I'll not leave this world until
they all choke on that laughter.

40:41.958 --> 40:44.492
Take that castle back.

40:45.962 --> 40:48.463
He'll never yield, Father.

40:48.565 --> 40:51.066
Oh, he'll yield.

40:55.572 --> 40:58.306
You'll show him the knife you used

40:58.408 --> 41:02.110
to kill Robb Stark's child
in his whore mother's belly,

41:02.212 --> 41:04.479
and you'll show him
the knife you used

41:04.581 --> 41:06.714
<i>to open his niece's throat.</i>

41:06.817 --> 41:08.783
<i>And you'll remind him who it was</i>

41:08.885 --> 41:12.754
that got married at the Red
Wedding in the first place.

41:12.856 --> 41:14.522
His nephew.

41:29.773 --> 41:32.407
<i>Cheer up, Lord Edmure.</i>

41:32.509 --> 41:34.576
You're going home.

41:34.678 --> 41:38.179
I'm being sent to deal
with the Blackfish.

41:38.281 --> 41:41.149
Apparently Walder Frey
can't manage it on his own

41:41.251 --> 41:43.051
because he's 400 years old.

41:43.153 --> 41:45.653
<i>Sent me with an army
to the Riverlands</i>

41:45.755 --> 41:47.622
and a siege that could last months.

41:47.724 --> 41:50.158
Better you're elsewhere
at the head of an army

41:50.260 --> 41:51.826
than in the sept dungeons.

41:51.928 --> 41:54.796
I'm not going to the Riverlands.

41:57.868 --> 41:59.100
What, then?

41:59.202 --> 42:00.635
I'm going to give Bronn

42:00.737 --> 42:02.804
the largest bag of gold
anyone's ever seen

42:02.906 --> 42:06.274
and have him gather
the best killers he knows.

42:06.376 --> 42:09.744
I'll take them to the sept and I'll
remove the High Sparrow's head

42:09.846 --> 42:11.679
and every other
sparrow head I can find.

42:11.781 --> 42:15.350
- You can't.
- He has our son! He stole our son!

42:15.452 --> 42:17.452
He's torn our family apart.

42:17.554 --> 42:19.888
How should we treat people
who tear us apart?

42:19.990 --> 42:24.058
We should treat them
without mercy and we will.

42:24.161 --> 42:26.995
But if you kill the High Sparrow,
you won't leave the sept alive.

42:27.097 --> 42:30.131
And without you,
this is all for nothing.

42:30.233 --> 42:33.601
Stand at the head of our army
where you belong,

42:33.703 --> 42:36.004
where Father wanted you.

42:36.106 --> 42:38.473
Show our men where
their loyalties belong.

42:38.575 --> 42:40.575
Show them what Lannisters are,

42:40.677 --> 42:42.610
what we do to our enemies.

42:43.980 --> 42:46.214
And take that stupid
little castle back

42:46.316 --> 42:48.516
because it's ours
and because you can.

42:48.618 --> 42:51.719
You'll stand trial soon.
I need to be here for you.

42:51.821 --> 42:55.990
It will be a trial by combat.

42:56.092 --> 42:58.459
I have the Mountain.

43:00.697 --> 43:03.364
They've made us both
stronger, all of them.

43:04.734 --> 43:06.768
They have no idea how strong we are.

43:06.870 --> 43:09.170
No idea what we're going
to do to them.

43:19.783 --> 43:22.183
We've always been together.

43:22.285 --> 43:24.852
We'll always be together.

43:24.955 --> 43:27.388
We're the only two
people in the world.

43:47.344 --> 43:49.177
Why did you help us?

43:52.716 --> 43:54.215
The Three-Eyed Raven
sent for me.

43:54.317 --> 43:55.516
The Three-Eyed
Raven's dead.

43:55.619 --> 43:57.685
Now he lives again.

44:10.367 --> 44:13.067
When I last saw you, you were a boy.

44:14.771 --> 44:16.337
A fearless boy.

44:16.439 --> 44:19.507
Loved to climb the castle
walls, frighten his mother.

44:19.609 --> 44:22.010
Who are you?

44:39.529 --> 44:41.296
Uncle Benjen.

44:42.699 --> 44:44.132
<i>The last letter Jon wrote me</i>

44:44.234 --> 44:46.067
said you had been
lost beyond the Wall.

44:49.072 --> 44:51.639
I led a ranging party
deep into the North

44:51.741 --> 44:54.475
to find white walkers.

44:54.577 --> 44:56.177
They found us.

44:56.279 --> 45:00.114
A white walker stabbed me in
the gut with a sword of ice.

45:02.452 --> 45:04.118
Left me there to die.

45:04.220 --> 45:05.620
To turn.

45:05.722 --> 45:08.289
The Children found me.

45:08.391 --> 45:11.592
Stopped the walker's
magic from taking hold.

45:11.695 --> 45:12.994
How?

45:13.096 --> 45:15.396
The same way they made the
walkers in the first place.

45:15.498 --> 45:16.831
You saw it yourself.

45:18.635 --> 45:20.635
Dragonglass.

45:20.737 --> 45:23.738
A shard of dragonglass
plunged into your heart.

45:26.009 --> 45:28.743
You are the Three-Eyed
Raven now.

45:28.845 --> 45:31.779
I didn't have time to learn.
I can't control anything.

45:34.818 --> 45:36.851
You must learn to control it

45:36.953 --> 45:38.853
before the Night King comes.

45:41.324 --> 45:43.124
Drink.

45:45.261 --> 45:48.329
One way or another,

45:48.431 --> 45:51.132
he will find his way
to the world of men.

45:51.234 --> 45:53.634
When he does,

45:53.737 --> 45:56.904
you will be there waiting for him.

45:57.006 --> 46:00.274
And you will be ready.

46:20.620 --> 46:23.087
<i>Everything all right?</i>

46:23.189 --> 46:25.223
<i>How many days' ride to Meereen?</i>

46:25.325 --> 46:27.158
<i>A week at best.</i>

46:27.260 --> 46:30.662
How many ships will I need to
bring my khalasar to Westeros?

46:30.764 --> 46:32.864
Dothraki and all their horses,

46:32.966 --> 46:35.300
the Unsullied, the Second Sons...

46:35.402 --> 46:37.268
1,000 ships easily.

46:37.370 --> 46:39.504
- Probably more.
- And who has that many?

46:39.606 --> 46:41.105
Nobody.

46:41.207 --> 46:43.241
Nobody yet.

46:45.312 --> 46:48.813
So we ride for Meereen and after
that we sail for Westeros.

46:48.915 --> 46:50.415
And what then?

46:50.517 --> 46:53.284
I take what is mine.

46:53.386 --> 46:56.220
You weren't made to sit
on a chair in a palace.

46:56.323 --> 46:58.656
What was I made for?

46:58.758 --> 47:02.427
You're a conqueror,
Daenerys Stormborn.

47:11.605 --> 47:13.104
Wait here.

47:49.576 --> 47:50.869
I'm going after her.

47:50.953 --> 47:52.412
Wait for me here.

48:47.759 --> 48:51.179
Every khal who ever lived
chose three blood riders

48:51.847 --> 48:54.766
to fight beside him and guard his way.

48:55.267 --> 48:57.561
But I am not a khal.

48:58.687 --> 49:00.981
I will not choose three blood riders.

49:02.357 --> 49:04.318
I choose you all.

49:07.529 --> 49:09.906
I will ask more of you than any khal

49:10.616 --> 49:12.868
has ever asked of his khalassar!

49:14.703 --> 49:18.081
Will you ride the wooden horses
across the black salt sea?

49:19.875 --> 49:23.920
Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits

49:24.546 --> 49:26.548
and tear down their stone houses?

49:29.092 --> 49:31.970
Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms,

49:32.387 --> 49:35.557
the gift Khal Drogo promised me

49:35.641 --> 49:37.976
before the Mother of Mountains?

49:40.937 --> 49:43.315
Are you with me?

49:46.360 --> 49:47.402
Now

49:50.656 --> 49:52.324
and always?
