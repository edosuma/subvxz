is always the same.

And it's not because
I'm heartless,

11:27.437 --> 11:29.979

Griffin O'Reilly,

Uh, yes.

Well done.
Did you look inside?

11:47.707 --> 11:50.419
I-i did, but i actually
found a discrepancy

11:50.420 --> 11:52.171
between what
the supplemental report says

11:52.172 --> 11:54.794
versus what's in the
prosecution's murder book.

11:54.795 --> 11:57.096
What kind of discrepancy?
A name.

11:57.097 --> 11:58.758
The murder book
says the hunting knife

11:58.759 --> 12:00.840
was found on the front lawn
by officer Jake...

12:00.841 --> 12:02.511

Chad mullens?

is insinuating here...

12:11.061 --> 12:13.112
I'm just reading from
the supplemental arrest report,

12:13.113 --> 12:15.694
which says that officer mullens
found the hunting knife,

12:15.695 --> 12:17.026
not our witness here.

12:17.027 --> 12:20.200

officer dorsey?

Uh... No.

Says officer mullens.

who i recently found out

12:31.631 --> 12:34.003
is under investigation
for drinking on the job,

12:34.004 --> 12:36.255
which explains why your boss
might want to keep his name

12:36.256 --> 12:38.297
off of the official
arrest report,

12:38.298 --> 12:40.759

for yours.

can we take a recess?

out, we attack the motive.

12:47.888 --> 12:49.058
Any thoughts?
Laurel: I had one.

12:49.059 --> 12:51.230
Prosecution's going to use
Marjorie's best friend

12:51.231 --> 12:53.102
to say that she wanted
to divorce Max,

12:53.103 --> 12:55.895
which would have eliminated
his inheritance per the prenup

12:55.896 --> 12:57.736
and thereby
giving him motive to kill.

12:57.737 --> 12:59.528
I looked into discrediting
the friend,

12:59.529 --> 13:01.450

Marjorie spoke to you

nearly a year ago.

13:29.139 --> 13:30.229

the following toast

about two months ago.

performed their first dance

of the Von trapp children."

when the murder occurred,

of the street.

that night,

that it was my neighbor,

34:19.138 --> 34:20.558
Okay.

34:20.559 --> 34:21.890
But tonight, i do you.

34:44.413 --> 34:45.794
Sam?

34:47.045 --> 34:48.467
Sam: In here.

34:52.511 --> 34:54.512
What's this all about?

34:54.513 --> 34:57.715
We are celebrating your win,
which, let me just say...

34:57.716 --> 34:59.478
You predicted.
I know.

35:02.681 --> 35:04.522
Here. Sit.

35:04.523 --> 35:08.486
I'm gonna head to the cellar
and get us a bottle.

35:08.487 --> 35:10.899
Don't move.

35:51.570 --> 35:53.612
Annie?
Everything okay?

35:56.445 --> 35:59.697
I found a bottle Ted and Leah
gave us for our 20th.

35:59.698 --> 36:00.948
Where you going?

36:00.949 --> 36:03.120
I have a client who just
called me from jail.

36:03.121 --> 36:04.833
I'll be home as soon as i can.

36:22.351 --> 36:24.181
Nia's inside.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.853
I just need a minute.
No.

36:25.854 --> 36:27.436
It's about
the Lila stangard murder.

36:30.068 --> 36:31.309
It's not my case.

36:31.310 --> 36:33.110
I told you...
I'm on probation.

36:33.111 --> 36:34.151
I know.

36:34.152 --> 36:36.944
But Sam knew her.
She was his student.

36:36.945 --> 36:40.278
They were close.

36:40.279 --> 36:42.200
They were close.

36:49.087 --> 36:51.208
Hey.
How'd it go?

36:51.209 --> 36:54.882
Fine. Got him out
on a misdemeanor.

36:54.883 --> 36:57.595
Annie.

36:57.596 --> 37:00.798
Hmm?
You sure we're okay?

37:00.799 --> 37:04.762
'Cause if we're not,
I'd rather talk about it.

37:04.763 --> 37:08.517
I promise it won't be
as scary as you think.

37:16.154 --> 37:18.156
Annie.

37:24.032 --> 37:27.416
We're good.
I promise.

37:40.879 --> 37:42.380
They were close.

They were close.

37:44.142 --> 37:45.723
You serious?

37:45.724 --> 37:47.224
You think he had something
to do with it?

37:47.225 --> 37:48.016
I don't know.
Why?

37:48.017 --> 37:49.557
Because she was his student?

37:49.558 --> 37:50.808
That's your case?

37:50.809 --> 37:52.350
One of his closest students.

37:52.351 --> 37:55.152
Which means he'd screw her.
Yeah.

37:55.153 --> 37:56.273
But kill her?

37:56.274 --> 37:59.156
We're all capable
of terrible things, Nate.

37:59.157 --> 38:00.658
This is your job talking.

38:00.659 --> 38:04.111
It's making you see bad
where there is none.

38:04.112 --> 38:07.034
But you got to stop,
go home, and talk to him.

38:07.035 --> 38:08.576
He told me nothing happened.

38:08.577 --> 38:11.619
Then there's your answer.
No, listen, all right?

38:11.620 --> 38:14.712
How many times has Nia asked you
those same questions, huh?

38:14.713 --> 38:16.674
And what did you tell her
about us?

38:16.675 --> 38:18.086
The truth?

to tell me that he was there,

38:49.077 --> 38:50.368
that his alibi checks out.

It's the only way
to stop my mind, all right?

38:53.452 --> 38:54.622
To know for sure

38:54.623 --> 38:56.213
that he didn't have anything
to do with this.
