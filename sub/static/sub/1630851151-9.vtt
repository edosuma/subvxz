WEBVTT

00:29.163 --> 00:30.698
No, rotate.

00:36.337 --> 00:38.005
You have to rotate it.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.445
Jesus Christ. May I?

01:05.566 --> 01:07.968
Oh, thank you.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.549
That's Linda Tripp.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.934
- Morning, Ron.

01:49.277 --> 01:51.945
Hello, Ken, it's Linda Tripp.

01:52.079 --> 01:55.082
Again. It was alarming enough
to be asked to write a how-to

01:55.216 --> 01:57.685
manual for my own job,
but it has now been nearly

01:57.785 --> 02:00.288
one month since I requested
the materials I need to even

02:00.421 --> 02:01.789
attempt to start on this,

02:01.922 --> 02:03.424
and-and still
I've received nothing.

02:14.302 --> 02:15.269
<i>At a minimum,</i>

02:15.436 --> 02:17.205
I will need my
correspondence books

02:17.271 --> 02:21.942
and all volumes of the archival
histories of JCOC 59 and 60.

02:25.546 --> 02:28.616
<i>If anyone cast the slightest
glance at my cubicle,</i>

02:28.782 --> 02:31.452
they would easily find
all of these on my desk there.

02:35.556 --> 02:38.058
<i>Lucianne,
have you had any occasion to</i>

02:38.125 --> 02:39.627
<i>talk to Linda recently?</i>

02:39.760 --> 02:42.796
<i>I haven't talked to Linda
since, uh, uh, the day</i>

02:42.896 --> 02:44.965
<i>she wore the wire
to the Ritz-Carlton Hotel.</i>

02:45.098 --> 02:47.067
<i>Judge Starr asked her
not to be in touch.</i>

02:47.134 --> 02:49.637
<i>-With anyone?
-Right, with anyone.</i>

02:49.737 --> 02:50.971
<i>
Are you surprised that only one</i>

02:51.138 --> 02:53.574
<i>out of ten Americans
view her favorably?</i>

02:53.641 --> 02:55.643
<i>No, not with how the White Houe</i>

02:55.743 --> 02:57.978
<i>and sundry sympathetic
people have</i>

02:58.078 --> 03:00.748
<i>framed the discussion
of Linda in such a negative wa.</i>

03:00.814 --> 03:03.251
<i>Do you think it also
might be that people don't</i>

03:03.317 --> 03:04.985
<i>like people
who tape their friends?</i>

03:19.500 --> 03:20.834
Rotate.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.117
- Hello.
- Hi.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.687
This is all that there was.
Nothing from your office...

03:39.820 --> 03:41.455
Ugh.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.796
Oh, and I, uh...
I checked the machine.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.531
This lady named Jane
from <i>The New Yorker,</i>

03:50.664 --> 03:52.633
she left, like, four messages.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.302
- She's writing
an article about...
- Fabulous.

03:54.402 --> 03:56.870
There's absolutely nothing
I can do about that.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.740
Well, you could at least
call her back and talk to her.

03:59.873 --> 04:02.910
Allison, my attorney made it
very plain. It would be unwise.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.244
I would lose my immunity.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.314
Meanwhile,
the Clintons get to turn me

04:06.414 --> 04:09.149
into Joseph Goebbels.

04:09.216 --> 04:11.319
And the whole world
believes them.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.656
Mom, just come home already.

04:18.826 --> 04:21.228
- I'm sick of staying with Dad.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.764
Can't blame you on that.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.934
- Look, the reporters are gone

04:27.067 --> 04:28.736
from our street
and I go by every day.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.438
Well, you shouldn't.

04:30.571 --> 04:31.905
It's not safe.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.941
But there's no one
there anymore.

04:34.074 --> 04:36.109
- I mean, come on. Mom?

04:36.243 --> 04:38.512
This? This is not healthy.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.681
You have your grand jury thing,
you are under

04:40.781 --> 04:42.916
so much stress and you are
just sitting here alone

04:43.050 --> 04:44.952
all day, reading articles
about yourself.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.423
It's not just my testimony.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.026
I'm going to make a statement.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.595
What do you mean?

04:54.728 --> 04:58.265
I've decided,
once I have my freedom back,

04:58.432 --> 05:02.436
I'm going to give a speech.
I'm going to address the nation.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.605
What are you going to say?

05:05.939 --> 05:08.442
I'm simply
going to tell my story.

05:27.294 --> 05:29.397
It's not fair.

05:29.463 --> 05:33.333
He didn't get paraded
down to the courthouse.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.335
He got to testify at home.

05:35.469 --> 05:36.904
I'm not the president.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.974
Okay, no, really--
how do I look?

05:41.074 --> 05:42.843
I'm going for
"not a deranged whore."

05:44.077 --> 05:46.146
Okay, what do you
want me to say?

05:46.313 --> 05:49.983
I'm about to be questioned
by 23 strangers,

05:50.083 --> 05:51.318
and whoever they are,

05:51.485 --> 05:53.253
I'm sure they already hate me.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.255
PLATO
Are you ready?

05:59.427 --> 06:02.663
<i>BILL
We committed ourselves
to a comprehensive strategy</i>

06:02.830 --> 06:08.168
<i>to lower the crime rate and mae
America a safer place to live.</i>

06:08.268 --> 06:11.038
- I gave him that tie.
- What?

06:11.171 --> 06:12.840
<i>...has shown remarkable result.</i>

06:12.940 --> 06:14.107
It's Zegna.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.943
I bought it at the Neiman's
in Mazza Gallerie.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.345
Does he know that she
is testifying today?

06:18.479 --> 06:19.547
I'm sure.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.348
Do you think he's trying
to send her a message?

06:21.482 --> 06:22.716
I mean, is that even legal?

06:22.850 --> 06:24.184
- Should I tell someone
about that?
- Mom.

06:24.284 --> 06:25.553
<i>
We should resolve to do better.</i>

06:25.686 --> 06:29.189
It's fine. I'm not going to
let it mess me up.

06:38.866 --> 06:43.704
She's here,
she's here! She's in that car!

06:43.837 --> 06:45.205
-- Monica!
-- Hey, Monica!

06:49.743 --> 06:51.712
I can save you, Monica!

06:53.681 --> 06:55.315
You are going to hell!

06:55.415 --> 06:57.485
Monica, how are you feeling?

06:59.219 --> 07:00.988
Monica, are you in love
with the president?

07:02.422 --> 07:04.057
Feel ready?

07:04.191 --> 07:06.426
I'm just excited to see
the inside of a courtroom.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.762
You know, this is the first time
Starr's given me anything

07:08.896 --> 07:10.564
to do beyond secretarial work.

07:10.698 --> 07:13.233
He is old-fashioned.

07:13.366 --> 07:15.435
And look, Monica and I
are familiar,

07:15.569 --> 07:18.105
but Starr does have a point.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.741
It's better that a woman asks
some of these questions.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.744
- She's here.
- Okay.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.579
You can bring in the jury.

07:34.354 --> 07:38.626
- Are they already in there?
- Yes, they've just been seated.

07:38.759 --> 07:41.028
We'll be right out here,
anytime you need.

07:56.276 --> 07:57.945
Good morning.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.113
You can have a seat right there.

08:12.660 --> 08:13.894
Can you raise your right hand?

08:13.961 --> 08:15.495
Oh, sure, yes.

08:17.130 --> 08:20.634
Do you, Monica S. Lewinsky,
swear to tell the truth,

08:20.768 --> 08:23.303
the whole truth and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?

08:23.403 --> 08:25.072
I do.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.913
Now, uh, Ms. Lewinsky,
what we're going to do

08:32.980 --> 08:34.514
is we're going to start off

08:34.648 --> 08:36.684
talking about your relationship
with the president.

08:38.819 --> 08:41.154
Do I not get
to learn people's names?

08:42.322 --> 08:46.426
Uh, the answer to that is no.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.495
Um, I know it seems kind of...

08:48.662 --> 08:49.997
Kind of awkward.

08:50.097 --> 08:54.534
It's important that the record
have no identifications.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.336
Oh, okay.

08:56.436 --> 08:59.439
Now, as we have discussed,
our office feels you'll be more

08:59.506 --> 09:02.676
comfortable getting certain
questions from Ms. Immergut,

09:02.776 --> 09:05.713
so I'm going to
turn it over to her now.

09:05.846 --> 09:08.716
Ms. Lewinsky,
can you tell the grand jury:

09:08.849 --> 09:10.350
when did you
start your relationship

09:10.483 --> 09:13.186
with the president
of the United States?

09:14.354 --> 09:16.624
November 15, 1995.

09:16.690 --> 09:19.192
Um, it was during the shutdown

09:19.292 --> 09:20.961
when I was assigned to
the West Wing.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.696
Can you tell the grand jury
what happened?

09:24.798 --> 09:27.635
Around... uh,
around00 in the evening

09:27.701 --> 09:30.971
I was headed into
Mr. Stephanopoulos's office.

09:31.038 --> 09:34.307
The president... was in there.

09:34.407 --> 09:39.579
He invited me into
the next room and then...

09:39.713 --> 09:40.981
we kissed.

09:41.048 --> 09:44.217
Did anything else
happen between you?

09:47.387 --> 09:49.056
Um...

09:50.057 --> 09:55.262
And we were more...
physically intimate after that.

09:55.395 --> 09:57.397
And what do you mean by that?

10:09.910 --> 10:11.078
On that occasion, did you

10:11.211 --> 10:12.512
perform oral sex
on the president?

10:12.612 --> 10:15.248
God, this is embarrassing.

10:15.382 --> 10:18.018
I assure you
we won't be dwelling on this.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.355
Yes, I did.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.925
Jesus.

10:25.759 --> 10:28.762
Was there any other
physical intimacy performed?

10:32.599 --> 10:35.135
Everything up to oral sex.

10:36.436 --> 10:38.939
Now, to avoid you having
to go into each subsequent

10:39.106 --> 10:41.274
act of physical intimacy,

10:41.441 --> 10:46.947
we'll introduce what we
have marked as Exhibit ML-7.

11:03.063 --> 11:04.998
Did you provide all
the information listed

11:05.132 --> 11:06.466
on this chart?

11:11.404 --> 11:12.806
Yes, I did.

11:12.973 --> 11:16.143
This details each of
your sexual encounters

11:16.309 --> 11:17.244
with President Clinton.

11:17.310 --> 11:19.246
To the best of your knowledge,

11:19.312 --> 11:20.647
is it all accurate?

11:22.182 --> 11:26.319
Yes. I want to hide
under this table, but yes.

11:26.419 --> 11:30.657
Ms. Lewinsky, did your
relationship with the president

11:30.824 --> 11:35.195
have a... non-sexual component?

11:36.196 --> 11:37.430
- Yes, it did.
- Could you describe that

11:37.497 --> 11:38.832
for the grand jury?

11:38.932 --> 11:41.501
Sure, um...

11:43.703 --> 11:46.006
It was more than just...

11:47.707 --> 11:50.177
We enjoyed
being with each other.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.447
He'd-- we would tell jokes,

11:54.547 --> 11:56.950
talk about our childhoods,
current events.

11:57.017 --> 11:59.686
Sometimes we'd just...

12:01.621 --> 12:03.390
Um, we'd just be affectionate.

12:03.523 --> 12:07.027
He'd push my hair
out of my face.

12:08.695 --> 12:10.864
I think back on it and...

12:10.964 --> 12:13.233
he always made me smile
when I was with him.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.702
It was a lot of, uh...

12:19.139 --> 12:20.874
He was sunshine.

12:28.648 --> 12:32.485
- We okay for a break?
- Uh, yeah, ten minutes?

12:33.921 --> 12:35.755
Ten minutes, everyone.

12:57.911 --> 13:01.448
Moving through your affidavit
here, let me ask you a question.

13:01.581 --> 13:03.851
Paragraph eight begins,

13:03.951 --> 13:06.086
"I have never had
a sexual relationship

13:06.219 --> 13:08.088
with the president."

13:08.221 --> 13:09.289
Is that true?

13:11.591 --> 13:12.926
- No.
- Okay,

13:13.026 --> 13:15.428
so the next logical
follow-up is:

13:15.562 --> 13:18.265
why were you willing to
say something false

13:18.431 --> 13:20.267
under penalty of perjury?

13:22.702 --> 13:25.538
Uh, I did not think my...
my private relationship

13:25.605 --> 13:27.140
was anyone's business.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.813
No one asked me to lie--
not the president, not anyone.

13:34.882 --> 13:38.451
I made that decision.
By myself.

13:38.551 --> 13:42.289
And I wish I hadn't,
to put it mildly.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.291
Thank you.

13:44.391 --> 13:47.127
Now, the grand jury
has some questions for you.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.498
- Okay.
- Did you and the president

13:51.631 --> 13:53.466
ever talk about
denying the relationship

13:53.566 --> 13:55.002
if anyone asked about it?

13:55.135 --> 13:58.138
I offered that on-on my own.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.307
I always told him
I would deny it.

14:00.407 --> 14:01.841
Why did you keep
that stained black dress?

14:01.975 --> 14:03.476
- It's a blue dress.
- Blue.
- Blue.

14:03.643 --> 14:05.478
Answer the question, please.

14:05.645 --> 14:08.315
Well, I have a lot of clothes,

14:08.481 --> 14:10.984
and so I don't usually
dry-clean things

14:11.151 --> 14:12.852
until I'm going
to wear them again.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.654
Like, I don't know
how you guys are,

14:14.754 --> 14:16.189
but you have clothes
to dry-clean

14:16.323 --> 14:18.525
and you kind of keep them
in your closet until you

14:18.658 --> 14:21.161
dry-clean them all together
when you need them.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.830
And now I feel like
I'm talking about

14:23.997 --> 14:26.833
dry-cleaning too much and
the process around dry-cleaning.

14:26.934 --> 14:30.670
Anyway, with that dress...

14:30.770 --> 14:32.339
I was going to wear it again

14:32.505 --> 14:34.674
and when I told Linda that,

14:34.774 --> 14:37.010
she told me
I looked heavy in it.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.680
Um, so I-I never
ended up wearing it again.

14:40.813 --> 14:45.385
Ergo I never cleaned it.
Does that answer your question?

14:46.453 --> 14:50.357
Ms. Lewinsky, did your mother
ever discourage

14:50.457 --> 14:52.625
your relationship
with the president?

14:53.793 --> 14:54.727
Oh, yes.

14:54.861 --> 14:57.630
Well, then, what kept it going?

14:59.632 --> 15:01.368
I fell in love.

15:02.369 --> 15:03.470
I have a question.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.572
You said you felt you were in

15:05.705 --> 15:07.374
a real relationship.

15:07.507 --> 15:08.875
A real connection.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.811
- Yes.
- With this married man.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.414
- Yes.
- It's been in the papers

15:14.547 --> 15:16.984
you had a relationship before.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.719
Similar to this, a married man.

15:19.819 --> 15:22.755
The way Kate and Andy Bleiler
made it seem on TV,

15:22.889 --> 15:25.492
it's-it's not entirely accurate.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.160
I-If that's the part
that you're, um...

15:27.260 --> 15:29.262
The only part I know is that

15:29.396 --> 15:31.898
he was a married man
and had a family.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.566
Yes.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.935
Like I know about the president.

15:37.237 --> 15:40.740
We're asked to trust
your version of events,

15:40.840 --> 15:43.276
but it seems you arrived
in D.C. and sought out

15:43.410 --> 15:47.580
a-an affair based on deception
and lies.

15:48.748 --> 15:51.118
Did you not believe that
this was wrong?

15:55.355 --> 15:57.124
My intention...

15:58.625 --> 16:01.128
...when I came to Washington
was to start over.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.597
I did not want
to have another affair

16:04.731 --> 16:06.633
with a married man
because it was horrible.

16:06.766 --> 16:09.036
And I don't know
why I did it again.

16:09.102 --> 16:12.105
I just know that I did it again.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.776
And I know a lot of...
a lot of people think that

16:16.909 --> 16:18.978
that's wrong, and so do I.

16:19.112 --> 16:23.950
I know there's a lot of work
I need to do on myself.

16:25.952 --> 16:28.121
I just feel I had to ask
the question because

16:28.255 --> 16:29.622
a lot of us are confused.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.458
- I'm not.
- No need to be rude.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.293
Oh, it's okay.

16:33.393 --> 16:34.794
In a way, I really,
I really appreciate

16:34.927 --> 16:36.296
you asking me
where I'm coming from,

16:36.429 --> 16:39.132
'cause most people just assume
when it comes to me, so...

16:39.232 --> 16:42.635
Um, I really respect
your question

16:42.769 --> 16:44.637
and I-I appreciate
what you're saying.

16:45.638 --> 16:46.806
Whatever your name is.

16:46.973 --> 16:48.575
Oh, Ms. Lewinsky...

16:48.641 --> 16:51.311
Can you, can you guys
call me Monica?

16:51.411 --> 16:53.012
Are-are they allowed
to call me Monica?

16:53.146 --> 16:54.481
If you say so.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.151
Sure.

16:58.251 --> 17:01.154
I'm just 25. Please.

17:01.254 --> 17:05.425
But you'll be Ms. Lewinsky
whether you're 25 or 28 or...

17:05.492 --> 17:08.495
- Not when I get married.

17:08.595 --> 17:12.665
Monica, do you
still love the president?

17:18.538 --> 17:21.674
The day they held me
at the Ritz,

17:21.774 --> 17:25.378
they wanted me to turn on him.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.514
I said no.

17:27.614 --> 17:30.517
I-I did not want to do anything
to let him get hurt.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.519
And then when this all came out,

17:32.652 --> 17:34.687
the-the people that
worked for him,

17:34.821 --> 17:36.623
they trashed me.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.225
They claim that they haven't,

17:38.358 --> 17:41.361
but they call me a stalker.
They called me a liar.

17:41.494 --> 17:45.465
They say I'm inappropriate.
I mean, you all know.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.202
And then he makes this speech.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.705
And he says...

17:52.839 --> 17:55.041
He makes it seem like...

17:55.142 --> 17:57.244
all that he cares about is
how unfair all of this

17:57.377 --> 17:59.412
- has been to him.
- Mm.

18:01.047 --> 18:04.317
So to-- sorry--
to answer your question, um...

18:07.254 --> 18:09.222
...it turns out he's not
who I thought he was.

18:09.356 --> 18:11.758
Monica, about that day
you just mentioned

18:11.891 --> 18:13.726
when you were approached
by Mr. Emmick

18:13.860 --> 18:16.663
and the OIC, can you tell us
a little bit about that?

18:16.763 --> 18:18.231
Oh, um...

18:18.365 --> 18:21.168
If I could ask,
uh, what areas are you

18:21.268 --> 18:22.669
wanting to get into?

18:22.769 --> 18:25.905
Because we're already
tight for time and, uh,

18:26.038 --> 18:27.407
well, you know, there were...

18:27.540 --> 18:29.442
many hours of activity.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.411
Just want to know
about that day.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.448
Okay, well, how about we
table that for now...

18:35.582 --> 18:38.751
- No, I want to hear about that.
- We should be able
to hear about that day.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.119
Let her talk. Why not?

18:40.253 --> 18:42.589
Let her talk.

18:42.722 --> 18:45.091
All right, go ahead.

18:46.426 --> 18:48.295
So, you were approached
in the food court

18:48.428 --> 18:50.597
at Pentagon City
by two FBI agents.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.932
Linda Tripp had lied
to get you there. Is that right?

18:53.032 --> 18:54.434
Uh, yes.

18:54.601 --> 18:57.304
And then they proceeded
to take you up to a hotel room.

18:57.437 --> 18:59.272
Why didn't you
ask for your lawyer?

19:00.607 --> 19:01.974
I did.

19:03.610 --> 19:06.112
But they told me
I was in trouble and that

19:06.279 --> 19:08.948
I wouldn't be able to help
myself with my attorney present,

19:09.048 --> 19:10.950
so I just did what they said.

19:11.117 --> 19:14.120
It was the FBI
and I was really scared.

19:14.221 --> 19:16.055
What happened
when you got up there?

19:23.129 --> 19:26.399
S-Sorry.

19:27.467 --> 19:30.637
Would it be okay--
uh, can you step out?

19:33.172 --> 19:36.142
Karin can take over
from here, right?

19:36.243 --> 19:38.345
Karin can take over.

19:38.478 --> 19:39.812
Karin can stay.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.664
Thank you.

20:06.005 --> 20:09.442
They said if I called my lawyer,
I wouldn't be offered immunity.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.844
Did you feel threatened by that?

20:12.779 --> 20:15.181
Did they offer you a chance
to call another attorney?

20:15.282 --> 20:16.883
They suggested one.

20:17.016 --> 20:18.851
Did you take them up on that?

20:18.985 --> 20:21.020
- No.
- Why not?

20:21.120 --> 20:23.890
- Because I didn't trust them.
- Hmm.

20:24.023 --> 20:26.459
It sounds as though they
were actively discouraging you

20:26.559 --> 20:28.395
from talking to an attorney.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.363
Well, from talking
to Frank Carter.

20:30.463 --> 20:33.300
Yes, Frank Carter,
my only attorney.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.703
Are we due for
a ten-minute break?

20:37.704 --> 20:38.971
No, ma'am.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.986
It lasted about 12 hours
in total.

20:54.053 --> 20:56.823
FEMALE JUROR
My God. Wow.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.826
And they told me over
and over that I was free

20:59.926 --> 21:01.594
to leave, but I didn't.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.433
I didn't understand
because they also said

21:06.566 --> 21:09.068
they were prepared
to indict me and I could

21:09.168 --> 21:12.104
spend up to 28 years in prison
and that they would

21:12.238 --> 21:16.242
prosecute my mother if I didn't
help them, you know? So...

21:16.343 --> 21:19.446
I was, uh, confused and, uh...

21:19.579 --> 21:21.080
Were you angry?

21:24.250 --> 21:27.086
Yes, mostly at myself.

21:27.186 --> 21:29.255
For ending up in this situation.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.794
And for putting the president
at risk.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.195
And...

21:38.365 --> 21:42.268
And-and for, uh,
doing this to my family.

21:42.402 --> 21:45.872
Monica, they set you in a trap.

21:45.938 --> 21:47.874
- Mm-hmm.
- It's what they do.

21:47.940 --> 21:49.942
Monica, is there anything else
you'd like to add

21:50.042 --> 21:51.277
to your testimony?

21:51.378 --> 21:53.480
We want to give you
the fullest opportunity.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.549
Um...

21:56.616 --> 21:59.051
Uh...

22:00.953 --> 22:05.625
I guess I want to say
that no one asked me to lie.

22:05.792 --> 22:08.495
And I was never
promised a job for my silence.

22:09.962 --> 22:11.464
Mostly I'm sorry.

22:12.965 --> 22:15.301
I'm really sorry for
everything that happened.

22:19.806 --> 22:22.308
- And I hate Linda Tripp.

22:22.409 --> 22:24.010
I know that's right.

22:24.143 --> 22:26.312
-Forget her.

22:26.479 --> 22:30.149
- What goes around comes around.
-It does.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.494
I am going to go in
and remove some

22:41.594 --> 22:44.163
extra cartilage
and bone right here.

22:44.263 --> 22:46.332
Then I'm going to go ahead
and pull the skin

22:46.433 --> 22:48.668
off of the issue so I can
chisel that bump down.

22:48.835 --> 22:52.004
Then we fracture it
so that we can close the roof,

22:52.104 --> 22:54.006
much the same way
you would on a house.

22:54.173 --> 22:55.174
Does that make sense?

22:55.341 --> 22:57.009
Um...

22:57.109 --> 22:58.445
Yeah.

22:58.511 --> 23:01.180
Dr. Loeb does wonderful work.

23:01.347 --> 23:03.015
Oh, thanks.
Okay, I'm going to go ahead

23:03.149 --> 23:05.351
and step out
and do my final prep.

23:05.485 --> 23:07.286
I'll see you in there.

23:07.353 --> 23:09.121
Okay.

23:12.792 --> 23:15.895
- Where's Steve?
- Oh, he didn't want to come.

23:16.028 --> 23:19.966
Is he still in a funk
about losing his job?

23:20.032 --> 23:21.868
Gosh, yes, he's...

23:22.001 --> 23:25.872
blaming my case and says
the airline fired him because of

23:25.972 --> 23:28.040
pressure from Clinton,
but, Susie,

23:28.174 --> 23:31.143
he wouldn't work the hours
that they wanted him to.

23:31.210 --> 23:32.912
I think that's all that it is.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.481
Well, did you tell him that?

23:35.982 --> 23:38.050
He won't listen to me.

23:40.820 --> 23:43.089
Hey. You nervous?

23:43.222 --> 23:46.092
I'm just glad that
people'll stop making fun

23:46.225 --> 23:47.927
of my big ol' awful nose.

25:33.766 --> 25:37.937
I'm told there is a Russian
children's verse that says,

25:38.004 --> 25:41.507
"What do we plant
when we plant a new wood?

25:41.608 --> 25:45.511
Boats in which waves
can safely be withstood."

25:45.612 --> 25:49.015
In both our nations,
music education is that

25:49.115 --> 25:51.350
sturdy boat that lifts us up,

25:51.483 --> 25:55.187
that carries our unique cultural
treasures into the future.

25:55.321 --> 25:58.791
And now, it is my honor to
introduce to you Bill Clinton,

25:58.891 --> 26:02.228
- president of the United States.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.744
Mr. President, Mr. Bowles
said you wanted this list...

26:17.877 --> 26:20.079
I know what it is. Thanks.

26:28.220 --> 26:30.556
Betty, would you ask
the first lady to come see me?

26:30.657 --> 26:32.224
Right away, sir.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.516
You wanted to see me?

26:57.616 --> 27:00.019
I wanted to say something.

27:10.797 --> 27:14.100
25 years, you're the one
opinion I give a shit about.

27:15.534 --> 27:19.271
Most men of our age, they...
they find their wives so dull

27:19.438 --> 27:22.374
they cringe
when she talks at dinner.

27:22.441 --> 27:24.711
I pity those men.

27:24.777 --> 27:27.113
They don't have what I do.

27:31.617 --> 27:35.121
I gave in to
a disgusting impulse.

27:35.254 --> 27:37.890
Because I didn't know
how to walk down the hall

27:37.957 --> 27:40.392
and say to my best friend

27:40.459 --> 27:42.729
that this job is lonely

27:42.795 --> 27:44.964
and I'm worn to the bone...

27:46.165 --> 27:48.567
...and I'm dead inside
half the time.

27:50.469 --> 27:52.138
There's been hell raining
down on us

27:52.238 --> 27:54.640
from the day we walked
into this place.

27:54.741 --> 27:56.976
You know, every move
we make-- the right,

27:57.076 --> 27:59.311
the press, they seize,
attack and drag us

27:59.411 --> 28:01.981
through the streets
over nothing.

28:02.081 --> 28:05.651
And I know it's stupid, but when
Newt shuts down the government,

28:05.752 --> 28:08.154
and Starr has slithered
into our lives

28:08.254 --> 28:10.990
to look for malfeasance
in every line of every receipt

28:11.157 --> 28:13.159
of every piddly thing
we've ever bought,

28:13.259 --> 28:15.828
I thought I had to be
strong for us.

28:15.995 --> 28:18.330
And instead, I fucked it all up.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.176
When it first came out,
I was so ashamed I wanted to

28:30.342 --> 28:32.278
crawl in a hole and disappear.

28:35.181 --> 28:37.850
I couldn't bear what I'd done
to you and Chelsea.

28:39.618 --> 28:42.688
I couldn't face telling you,
I just couldn't.

28:44.857 --> 28:47.459
So I made it worse and I lied.

28:56.135 --> 29:00.306
Everything good in my life
comes out of us together.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.813
I don't know who I am
without you.

29:08.080 --> 29:11.050
I know you said you
didn't care why it happened.

29:11.183 --> 29:13.385
But I wanted you to know.

29:19.325 --> 29:20.592
Is that all?

29:20.726 --> 29:22.261
No.

29:22.394 --> 29:23.896
I love you.

29:24.931 --> 29:26.598
That's all.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.452
- Mom?
- Busy.

29:46.585 --> 29:47.854
There's all this stuff in here.

29:47.954 --> 29:49.121
I didn't know that
you were arrested.

29:49.255 --> 29:50.756
It was a teen prank.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.925
Some boys put things in
my purse as a joke.

29:53.059 --> 29:54.626
Okay, but this part
about your dad--

29:54.760 --> 29:56.628
I mean, you don't talk about him
my entire life and I have

29:56.762 --> 29:59.431
no idea why until someone
writes an article about it.

30:11.777 --> 30:13.612
Oh, my God.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.453
Jesus Christ.

30:24.456 --> 30:26.625
- Unbelievable.
- What?

30:26.792 --> 30:28.460
None of this
is what I asked for.

30:28.560 --> 30:31.297
They know what I need
to do my job and they...

30:31.430 --> 30:34.466
they send me a completely
useless pile of paper.

30:35.801 --> 30:37.736
And look at the shape it's in.

30:45.011 --> 30:46.145
This is a message.

30:46.312 --> 30:49.315
Could just be one
of the lazier secretaries.

30:51.650 --> 30:52.985
Bring my purse.

31:00.659 --> 31:03.495
- Oh, my God.
- Linda,

31:03.595 --> 31:05.197
I didn't know
you were coming in.

31:05.331 --> 31:07.099
I need to see Ken.

31:15.674 --> 31:18.177
- Excuse me.
- I work here.

31:18.277 --> 31:19.511
Uh...

31:21.613 --> 31:24.516
No, I have to go.
Okay, it's just-- Leave us.

31:24.650 --> 31:27.186
Linda, you know you
cannot just...

31:27.286 --> 31:28.854
Did you oversee
and approve this shipment?

31:28.988 --> 31:30.389
- What?
- It's a simple question.

31:30.522 --> 31:33.792
Did you oversee
and approve this shipment?

31:33.892 --> 31:36.295
- I can't say that I have any...
- Because I asked
for the basic materials

31:36.395 --> 31:38.897
I need to do my job
and what I got

31:39.031 --> 31:41.633
was random printed
email traffic.

31:41.733 --> 31:45.637
Some JCOC participant list
thrown violently into a box.

31:45.737 --> 31:48.374
- Linda.
- This is chilling.

31:48.507 --> 31:52.078
This is veiled hostility
from my colleagues,

31:52.211 --> 31:53.412
simply because
I'm a cooperating witness

31:53.545 --> 31:54.981
in a federal investigation.

31:55.081 --> 31:56.815
I'm sure it was
just an honest mistake.

31:56.915 --> 31:59.485
- We are past that, Ken.
- Listen.

31:59.551 --> 32:01.553
Just write down exactly
what you need

32:01.653 --> 32:03.922
- and then we...
- What I need

32:04.056 --> 32:07.259
is to come here like normal
and do my work.

32:07.393 --> 32:09.595
And I do not doubt that
you'll be able to do that soon,

32:09.728 --> 32:10.662
and that things
will settle down,

32:10.762 --> 32:12.898
but DOD just opened this
investigation

32:12.999 --> 32:14.233
- and until we...
- What?

32:15.434 --> 32:16.602
What investigation?

32:20.606 --> 32:22.241
They'll be contacting you.

32:22.374 --> 32:23.742
When you were hired,

32:23.875 --> 32:28.080
you affirmed on your DD 398 that
you had never been arrested.

32:28.214 --> 32:29.581
Now, <i>The New Yorker</i>
has come out...

32:29.715 --> 32:31.083
It was a teen prank!

32:31.217 --> 32:33.285
- Linda...
- On me!

32:35.287 --> 32:36.755
The charges were dropped.

32:36.888 --> 32:40.292
Linda, you cannot lie
to the Department of Defense

32:40.426 --> 32:42.128
on a security clearance form.

32:42.261 --> 32:44.530
That is a serious crime.

32:45.597 --> 32:47.099
I see.

32:49.135 --> 32:50.436
I see now.

32:51.437 --> 32:52.604
You see what?

32:52.738 --> 32:55.441
They're really coming after me.

32:55.541 --> 32:57.609
Okay, well...

33:12.991 --> 33:15.294
Good afternoon, ma'am.
I'm Special Agent Irons

33:15.427 --> 33:17.129
with the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

33:17.296 --> 33:18.964
This is Special Agent Fallon.

33:19.065 --> 33:21.300
Do you have
a moment to speak with us?

33:25.971 --> 33:27.306
Thank you, ma'am.

33:27.406 --> 33:28.807
We're detailed with the Office

33:28.907 --> 33:30.809
of Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr.

33:30.909 --> 33:32.811
Perhaps you've seen
Judge Starr on the news.

33:32.911 --> 33:35.514
Well, he's finishing up
his investigation,

33:35.647 --> 33:37.483
preparing to
make a report to Congress.

33:37.583 --> 33:39.485
We're just here following up
on some threads.

33:39.651 --> 33:42.188
Ma'am, as you may know,
the president and others

33:42.321 --> 33:44.690
are in legal peril because
of false affidavits

33:44.823 --> 33:46.492
filed in the Paula Jones
lawsuit.

33:46.658 --> 33:48.860
We're just dotting our i's,
Ms. Broaddrick. You understand.

33:48.994 --> 33:52.331
Now, here is
your Jones affidavit.

33:52.498 --> 33:54.500
You swore this
a few months back.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.502
Here, you state that
President Bill Clinton

33:56.668 --> 33:59.671
never made any unwanted
sexual advances toward you.

33:59.771 --> 34:03.275
Ma'am, were you being truthful
when you signed your name

34:03.342 --> 34:05.010
to this statement?

34:18.890 --> 34:20.226
-I don't...

34:20.359 --> 34:21.860
I don't get it.

34:23.195 --> 34:25.131
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

34:26.132 --> 34:28.234
How was your audition?

34:28.367 --> 34:30.136
It sucked.

34:30.236 --> 34:34.373
- Who was that?
- The lawyers. They said...

34:35.807 --> 34:37.576
...the judge did
a summary judgment.

34:37.709 --> 34:40.212
Mm. What is that?

34:40.312 --> 34:42.314
It's... it's bad.

34:42.381 --> 34:46.218
It means that
she threw out the case.

34:47.319 --> 34:48.887
The Supreme Court said
you had a case.

34:49.020 --> 34:52.090
But now the judge
says I don't, so I...

34:52.224 --> 34:53.825
I guess it's over.

34:53.925 --> 34:57.329
What? What-what do we get?
How much money we get?

34:57.429 --> 34:59.765
Well, that's what
I'm saying. Um...

34:59.898 --> 35:02.268
It's nothing.
We get nothing.

35:02.401 --> 35:03.902
- The fuck?!
- I know.

35:04.035 --> 35:06.104
- I know, I need to call Susie.
- Oh, yeah, great idea.

35:06.238 --> 35:08.274
Smart. She always
makes things better.

35:08.407 --> 35:10.609
- Steve, don't.
- No, no, we need to go back

35:10.742 --> 35:11.777
and we need to
take Clinton's deal.

35:11.910 --> 35:13.078
I wanted that money.

35:13.212 --> 35:16.915
What?
No, no, but you and Susie

35:17.015 --> 35:19.084
told me that
I shouldn't take it, so...

35:19.218 --> 35:22.454
I don't wanna hear
your fucking voice.

35:22.588 --> 35:24.590
Wait, but that is not fair
because I-- gosh,

35:24.723 --> 35:27.593
I only ever started doing this
'cause you wanted me to.

35:27.693 --> 35:30.429
I-I did... I did all this
for you.

35:30.562 --> 35:33.131
You sound pretty stupid
right now with your face

35:33.265 --> 35:35.434
all broken from a nose job.

35:35.534 --> 35:38.103
Because I got a bad nose,

35:38.204 --> 35:40.306
which I didn't even know I had

35:40.439 --> 35:42.941
until you made me do this
and be on TV

35:43.108 --> 35:46.445
and people laughed at me, but...

35:46.545 --> 35:49.114
but I did it, like I always
do what you say.

35:49.248 --> 35:50.982
You think I liked
moving to California,

35:51.116 --> 35:52.451
where I've never seen
so many people

35:52.551 --> 35:54.119
who smile while they hate you

35:54.253 --> 35:55.954
and it makes my skin
fucking crawl

35:56.087 --> 35:58.290
and it's sunny all day
and it's...

35:58.457 --> 36:00.125
You think it'll be better
if we move home,

36:00.226 --> 36:02.794
where everyone knows exactly
who you are and what you did?

36:02.961 --> 36:04.630
What do you mean, "what I did"?

36:08.300 --> 36:09.801
What do you mean?

36:12.137 --> 36:15.641
Say it. Say it, Steve.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.646
You think I did it.

36:20.746 --> 36:23.649
You think I went up there
and I gave him a blow job.

36:27.353 --> 36:29.821
Yeah, okay, okay.

36:31.189 --> 36:34.493
I can take this from Jay Leno

36:34.593 --> 36:39.030
and people laughing at me
at Vons, but...

36:39.164 --> 36:40.999
from you?

36:41.099 --> 36:43.001
You're supposed to believe me!

36:43.101 --> 36:47.172
We are fighting to show people
that he did me wrong!

36:47.339 --> 36:49.841
And...

36:49.941 --> 36:51.843
And in reality,
all-all this is--

36:51.943 --> 36:54.346
all the press conferences
and all the magazines

36:54.480 --> 36:56.348
and-and the TV shows

36:56.482 --> 36:59.451
and the lawyers and more lawyers
and more lawyers--

36:59.551 --> 37:03.289
it's just me trying to get you
to believe me!

37:03.355 --> 37:08.527
Which we both know you
never did, so you know what?

37:08.660 --> 37:11.630
If you want to say I'm stupid,
well, fuck you!

37:11.697 --> 37:14.300
But most of all,
if I'm stupid on one thing,

37:14.366 --> 37:15.867
it was believing that
you were any more

37:16.001 --> 37:19.305
than a chickenshit asshole
who cared about me at all!

37:31.483 --> 37:34.052
Oh, you think
I'm gonna ask you to stay?!

37:41.560 --> 37:43.895
Okay, it's pretty simple.

37:43.995 --> 37:46.264
You listen to all of
these tapes. After each one,

37:46.398 --> 37:48.600
you sign the tape,
as well as sign

37:48.734 --> 37:49.935
and date those documents,

37:50.068 --> 37:53.238
confirming that the voices
are you and Linda Tripp.

37:53.339 --> 37:54.740
I have to listen
to all of these?

37:54.873 --> 37:56.575
They're all evidence.

37:56.675 --> 37:58.744
Karin here will sit in with you.

37:58.844 --> 38:00.946
I would, but I gotta get
to the courthouse.

38:01.079 --> 38:03.349
What's happening
at the courthouse?

38:07.586 --> 38:10.088
Do you, Linda R. Tripp,
swear to tell the truth,

38:10.221 --> 38:12.791
the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

38:12.924 --> 38:14.292
I do.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.931
You ready?

38:23.535 --> 38:25.937
<i>-- Hi.
-- Hi.</i>

38:27.272 --> 38:28.440
<i>How are you?</i>

38:30.108 --> 38:33.445
Uh, now, with
Mr. Wisenberg's assistance,

38:33.545 --> 38:35.280
I'd like to read to you

38:35.447 --> 38:38.784
what the grand jury
has come to know as Tape 11.

38:40.552 --> 38:42.888
You have a, uh,
transcript there.

38:42.954 --> 38:44.656
Okay.

38:46.625 --> 38:48.794
"Linda, I got the creep a tie.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.962
It was 20 bucks at Marshalls."

38:51.129 --> 38:52.964
"Oh, good, who makes it?"

38:53.131 --> 38:55.166
"Calvin Klein.
It's gorgeous, Linda."

38:55.300 --> 38:57.469
"Yeah, Marshalls generally,

38:57.603 --> 38:59.505
every now and then,
you can hit."

38:59.638 --> 39:02.641
"It's really different from all
the other ones I've given him.

39:02.774 --> 39:04.643
"I'm putting a note with it.

39:04.743 --> 39:06.077
I wrote such a funny card
to him."

39:06.144 --> 39:07.479
Linda Tripp laughs.

39:07.579 --> 39:08.814
<i>
-I said, "This tie will</i>

39:08.980 --> 39:11.182
<i>"look good with either
a taupe or navy suit</i>

39:11.316 --> 39:12.684
<i>"and a white
or a light blue shirt.</i>

39:12.818 --> 39:15.421
<i>-That is, if you like it."
-Mm-hmm.</i>

39:15.487 --> 39:17.022
"And then do you know
what I wrote?

39:17.155 --> 39:20.992
"I said, 'And just think,
now you can pay homage to me

39:21.159 --> 39:24.262
"if you want by having
a work week in which you

39:24.329 --> 39:26.097
wear one of my ties every day.'"

39:26.164 --> 39:27.433
Linda Tripp laughs.

39:27.499 --> 39:29.367
<i>Ms. Lewinsky laughs.</i>

39:29.501 --> 39:31.437
<i>
-'Cause this
is the fifth one, right?</i>

39:31.503 --> 39:33.271
<i>You have to give him one
for the weekend days, too.</i>

39:33.338 --> 39:36.675
"That's what I want.
That's my fantasy.

39:36.775 --> 39:40.345
To have the creep
wear one of my ties every day."

39:41.346 --> 39:45.216
Um, Ms. Tripp,
who was the creep?

39:49.020 --> 39:51.457
The president
of the United States.

39:51.523 --> 39:55.026
Was this typical
of the sort of subject

39:55.126 --> 39:56.862
you and Monica Lewinsky
would discuss?

39:56.995 --> 39:59.898
Yes, we almost
never talked about anything

40:00.031 --> 40:02.300
aside from the president.

40:02.367 --> 40:04.870
She shared a lot of intimate
details with you, did she not?

40:07.038 --> 40:08.306
She did.

40:08.373 --> 40:09.575
<i>MONICA
I was upset before,</i>

40:09.708 --> 40:11.543
<i>but not like I am now.</i>

40:11.643 --> 40:13.044
<i>
Oh, man.</i>

40:13.144 --> 40:14.980
<i>
It's too much for one person.</i>

40:15.080 --> 40:17.483
<i>
Oh, it is too much
for one person.</i>

40:17.583 --> 40:18.550
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

40:18.684 --> 40:21.252
Moving into November 1997.

40:21.386 --> 40:25.423
Is it fair to say that
Ms. Lewinsky was increasingly

40:25.557 --> 40:27.759
distraught
on her calls with you?

40:27.893 --> 40:31.597
Yes, she was obsessed with
the president's lack of contact.

40:31.730 --> 40:35.433
And what typically would happen
when she tried to make contact?

40:35.567 --> 40:38.504
She would call Betty Currie
and then call me

40:38.604 --> 40:39.938
to tell me she called Betty.

40:40.071 --> 40:41.406
And then, if Betty hadn't
gotten back to her

40:41.507 --> 40:43.509
within an hour,
she would get angry

40:43.609 --> 40:46.011
and call Betty again,
then call me again.

40:46.111 --> 40:49.447
Crescendoing to some sort
of nuclear outburst.

40:49.581 --> 40:51.282
Okay, now I'd like to move...

40:51.416 --> 40:54.019
Sorry, can I ask a question?

40:57.923 --> 41:00.258
Did you want Monica
to stop calling you?

41:00.391 --> 41:02.460
Yes.

41:02.594 --> 41:06.464
Her behavior became volatile.
Very erratic.

41:06.598 --> 41:10.435
So why did you not just say,
"Please stop calling me"?

41:10.536 --> 41:13.271
That's what my kid said.

41:13.404 --> 41:14.272
So why didn't you?

41:14.439 --> 41:17.442
Well, at a,
at a certain point,

41:17.543 --> 41:18.877
you can't unring a bell.

41:18.944 --> 41:21.446
You talk like this was
a grave situation

41:21.547 --> 41:24.215
and harmful for Monica, right?

41:24.282 --> 41:26.785
- Yes, very.
- But earlier

41:26.952 --> 41:28.620
we heard you encouraging her

41:28.720 --> 41:30.889
to buy him a tie for each day
of the week.

41:30.956 --> 41:33.559
Well, that...

41:33.625 --> 41:34.960
I was joking.

41:35.126 --> 41:38.229
And when Monica said,
"I got the creep a tie.

41:38.296 --> 41:40.632
It was 20 bucks at Marshalls,"

41:40.799 --> 41:42.734
you replied, "Oh, good."

41:42.801 --> 41:44.570
Well, I was being...

41:45.737 --> 41:47.338
That was more of
a pro-Marshalls.

41:47.472 --> 41:51.409
So, was this a serious situation
or was this a joking matter?

41:51.476 --> 41:53.311
That's one moment
out of context.

41:53.478 --> 41:55.814
Or were you just trying
to keep her talking?

41:55.914 --> 41:58.349
Because by then you were taping.

41:59.685 --> 42:01.152
I prefer to call it documenting.

42:01.252 --> 42:02.320
Why did you tape her?

42:02.487 --> 42:04.189
We'll get to that
in just a little bit.

42:04.322 --> 42:06.658
I documented our phone calls
because I knew

42:06.758 --> 42:09.027
- I needed evidence.
- Evidence for what?

42:10.495 --> 42:12.931
Well, for--
so when I came forward...

42:12.998 --> 42:14.933
- But it was a private matter.
- I don't think you comprehend...

42:15.000 --> 42:16.668
It was between Monica
and the president.

42:16.835 --> 42:17.836
No one needed to know.

42:17.936 --> 42:20.505
Actually, this was
a very young staffer

42:20.606 --> 42:23.008
in a workplace with
the most senior official

42:23.108 --> 42:24.843
in that workplace making choices

42:24.943 --> 42:27.679
that were causing her
severe distress.

42:27.846 --> 42:30.015
She told me
on more than one occasion

42:30.148 --> 42:31.449
she wanted to kill herself.

42:31.549 --> 42:35.353
And still, the president
of the United States

42:35.453 --> 42:37.288
used her to meet his needs.

42:37.355 --> 42:41.459
He had total control.
His behavior was unconscionable.

42:44.462 --> 42:46.531
It was an abuse of power.

42:46.665 --> 42:48.700
- Mrs. Tripp...
- I had to end it.

42:48.834 --> 42:50.468
I had to end it.

42:55.907 --> 42:59.645
Mrs. Tripp, when you chose to...

42:59.745 --> 43:03.048
begin documenting Monica,

43:03.181 --> 43:06.251
you were under enormous stress,
correct?

43:06.384 --> 43:08.987
I was terrified.

43:09.087 --> 43:12.490
I knew if I came forward
with no evidence,

43:12.557 --> 43:14.092
they would destroy me.

43:14.225 --> 43:17.062
When you say "they,"
who are you referring to?

43:17.195 --> 43:19.931
Bill Clinton.

43:20.065 --> 43:22.267
And, uh, Hillary Rodham Clinton.

43:22.400 --> 43:24.235
- Oh, man.

43:26.504 --> 43:29.174
The president's lawyer
had already made

43:29.274 --> 43:31.609
a defamatory statement
about me in <i>Newsweek.</i>

43:31.743 --> 43:33.745
I was sure I was
going to be subpoenaed

43:33.879 --> 43:35.280
in the Paula Jones case.

43:35.413 --> 43:37.415
I felt, if I told
the truth under oath,

43:37.515 --> 43:39.584
I would lose my job.

43:39.718 --> 43:41.252
Or worse.

43:41.352 --> 43:44.455
You thought if you told the
truth in the Paula Jones case...

43:44.589 --> 43:46.091
I was afraid I wouldn't even
get the chance.

43:46.191 --> 43:48.960
Are you-- are you saying you
thought you would be killed?

43:49.094 --> 43:50.929
Yes.

43:51.062 --> 43:53.298
- Why?
- I have what I consider

43:53.431 --> 43:55.100
well-founded fears

43:55.200 --> 43:57.202
of what this administration
is capable of.

43:57.268 --> 43:59.037
Can you give an example?

43:59.104 --> 44:01.940
I have, uh, reason to believe

44:02.073 --> 44:04.142
that the Vince Foster
tragedy was not

44:04.275 --> 44:07.278
depicted accurately by
members of the administration.

44:07.412 --> 44:10.615
Are you-- are you saying
he didn't commit suicide?

44:10.782 --> 44:13.284
We will never know.

44:13.451 --> 44:15.453
Mrs. Tripp,
do you have information

44:15.586 --> 44:17.655
about the White House
and the death of Vince Foster?

44:17.789 --> 44:20.792
I'll just say this.

44:20.959 --> 44:23.795
The day after that tragedy,

44:23.929 --> 44:27.465
the behavior I saw in
the West Wing frightened me.

44:27.632 --> 44:30.501
There was a flurry
of activity, boxes

44:30.635 --> 44:32.470
and secrecy behind closed doors.

44:32.603 --> 44:35.140
I was concerned,
and I was alarmed.

44:35.273 --> 44:37.976
Because people were
meeting behind closed doors?

44:38.076 --> 44:42.147
It was far more
ominous than that.

44:45.350 --> 44:48.253
I am telling you,
under oath today,

44:48.319 --> 44:50.655
that I felt threatened.

44:50.822 --> 44:54.993
And I was angry.
And I resented it.

44:55.160 --> 44:57.996
- And still do.
-I have a question.

44:58.163 --> 45:00.331
Did you ever think
about what would happen

45:00.498 --> 45:02.768
to Monica
when all this came out?

45:05.503 --> 45:08.339
<i>All right,
call me back, you nut.</i>

45:08.439 --> 45:11.676
<i>-Ugh. I will, I will.
-Bye.</i>

45:20.618 --> 45:21.853
- Done.
- Your attorney

45:21.987 --> 45:23.188
has a car waiting for you
out back.

45:23.288 --> 45:24.355
If you want, I can...

45:24.489 --> 45:26.391
I know the way.

45:30.962 --> 45:34.532
I thought, uh,
if this became public,

45:34.665 --> 45:37.368
Monica would not be
in any sort of danger.

45:37.502 --> 45:39.871
But you said you felt dangers,
both personal

45:39.971 --> 45:41.873
and professional,
could befall you.

45:41.973 --> 45:44.709
What crossed your mind
that would befall Monica?

45:46.244 --> 45:48.379
Uh, what-what would befall her?

45:48.479 --> 45:50.715
<i>
Did you have any fears for her?</i>

45:50.849 --> 45:52.717
<i>All these details in the publi.</i>

45:52.851 --> 45:55.553
<i>She was...
I-I think I said this.</i>

45:55.686 --> 45:57.488
<i>Uh, she was suicidal.</i>

45:57.555 --> 45:59.057
<i>You're not
answering her question.</i>

45:59.157 --> 46:04.429
What Monica was going through
was extremely unhealthy.

46:04.562 --> 46:06.597
But you didn't think
it would bring her harm?

46:08.099 --> 46:10.101
Well, not compared to...

46:12.770 --> 46:14.739
- No.
- Why not?

46:16.574 --> 46:17.675
Uh, pardon?

46:17.775 --> 46:20.511
Why would you
not think about her?

46:23.915 --> 46:28.119
I was thinking that she was
in a tremendously bad situation.

46:30.088 --> 46:33.758
And do you feel now she's better
off because of what you did?

46:33.892 --> 46:36.294
Do you feel
her life is better now?

46:45.636 --> 46:48.039
- How'd it go?
- Ready, Linda?

46:49.440 --> 46:50.942
You sure?

46:51.109 --> 46:53.044
You don't have
to do this right now.

47:09.127 --> 47:10.461
<i>
We understand</i>

47:10.561 --> 47:13.064
there is some interest
in hearing from Ms. Tripp.

47:13.131 --> 47:15.666
She will not be taking
any questions today.

47:15.800 --> 47:19.971
She has, however, agreed
to make some brief remarks.

47:23.975 --> 47:27.178
Good afternoon.
I'm not a public speaker.

47:27.312 --> 47:29.180
I'm going to have to refer
to my notes.

47:29.314 --> 47:30.315
Please bear with me.

47:35.486 --> 47:38.656
I understand that there's
been a great deal of speculation

47:38.756 --> 47:42.160
about just who I am
and how I got here.

47:42.260 --> 47:44.662
Well, the answer is simple.

47:44.762 --> 47:47.999
I'm you.
I'm just like you.

47:49.167 --> 47:52.503
I'm an average American
who found herself in a situation

47:52.603 --> 47:54.839
not of her own making.

47:54.940 --> 47:57.842
Because I am just like you,
I ask you to imagine how you

47:57.943 --> 48:00.678
would feel if someone
you thought was a friend

48:00.778 --> 48:02.613
urged you to commit a felony.

48:04.015 --> 48:06.784
Imagine how you would feel
if your boss's attorney

48:06.884 --> 48:09.687
called you a liar in front
of the whole country.

48:10.888 --> 48:12.390
And imagine if that boss

48:12.523 --> 48:14.960
was the president
of the United States.

48:18.029 --> 48:21.799
Imagine how you would feel
if your employer demoted you

48:21.899 --> 48:25.570
and cast you aside,
for daring to tell the truth.

48:29.640 --> 48:32.810
Imagine how it would feel to see
the pain in your children's eyes

48:32.877 --> 48:35.413
when they hear
a seemingly endless barrage

48:35.546 --> 48:37.748
of lies about their mother.

48:37.882 --> 48:41.752
A mother who is not
going out to defend herself.

48:47.592 --> 48:50.428
I've been vilified for
taking the path of truth.

48:51.596 --> 48:53.598
I've been maligned
by people who have chosen

48:53.731 --> 48:55.666
not to tell the truth,

48:55.766 --> 48:59.070
and who know they
are not telling the truth.

48:59.204 --> 49:01.006
To cast me in the role
of the villain,

49:01.106 --> 49:03.774
they have enlisted
legions of paid prevaricators.

49:03.908 --> 49:05.776
Not surprisingly, many
from the entertainment industry

49:05.910 --> 49:08.779
have chosen to ridicule me
as well.

49:09.947 --> 49:12.617
Going so far as to even
make fun of my appearance

49:12.750 --> 49:16.287
in a manner so mean and so cruel
that I pray none of you

49:16.421 --> 49:17.855
is ever subjected to it.

49:19.924 --> 49:21.626
Despite all of that,

49:21.759 --> 49:24.795
I bear no malice towards
anyone in this case.

49:33.771 --> 49:35.606
I believe in our country.

49:36.941 --> 49:40.111
As I said, I am no different
than any of you.

49:40.245 --> 49:44.282
I believe you have the right
to tell the truth under oath

49:44.382 --> 49:46.951
without fear
of retribution or worse.

49:49.054 --> 49:52.457
I hope that when all
the facts are revealed,

49:52.557 --> 49:54.125
you'll understand that
it is a right

49:54.292 --> 49:56.561
all of us
should be fighting for.

49:59.297 --> 50:00.631
Thank you.

50:02.900 --> 50:04.635
Why did you
betray Monica Lewinsky?

50:05.803 --> 50:06.837
We're not taking any questions.

50:06.971 --> 50:09.074
Linda, do you regret
taping Monica?

50:09.140 --> 50:10.975
Isn't it true
you manipulated her?

50:11.142 --> 50:13.578
Did you do
all this for a book deal?

50:24.155 --> 50:25.523
<i>The atmosphere
feels very different</i>

50:25.656 --> 50:26.824
<i>-among the party now.
-Look, I've read</i>

50:26.924 --> 50:28.159
<i>the deposition
and it's very clear...</i>

50:28.259 --> 50:29.527
<i>
Members of President Clinton's</i>

50:29.660 --> 50:30.828
<i>own party are now wavering
in their support,</i>

50:30.928 --> 50:31.829
<i>including my guest,</i>

50:31.996 --> 50:33.531
<i>Congressman Jim Moran.</i>

50:33.664 --> 50:35.833
<i>
The fact is he lied
to the American people.</i>

50:36.000 --> 50:38.336
<i>That is undoubtedly going to</i>

50:38.503 --> 50:40.938
<i>necessitate
impeachment proceedings.</i>

50:55.186 --> 50:59.190
Andrew Johnson-- worst leader
this country ever had.

50:59.290 --> 51:02.026
Racist to his core,
drunk as hell

51:02.127 --> 51:04.529
the day he took over
for Lincoln.

51:05.963 --> 51:09.700
1868 Congress
finally impeached his ass.

51:11.035 --> 51:13.871
Only president
that's happened to, only one.

51:15.473 --> 51:16.874
Till now.

51:18.643 --> 51:20.878
I hate it when you're like this.

51:21.011 --> 51:24.149
We have not
lost anything, not yet.

51:29.220 --> 51:30.888
I'll call Jim Moran.

51:31.989 --> 51:33.658
What'll you say?

51:33.724 --> 51:37.995
I will say that if he thinks
he is fighting for me,

51:38.095 --> 51:41.065
then he needs
to fight on my side.

51:41.166 --> 51:43.434
And the way I see it,

51:43.568 --> 51:46.237
there are forces that have
been trying to take my husband

51:46.371 --> 51:49.106
down his whole life
and I don't want them to win.

51:49.240 --> 51:50.941
And I won't let them.

51:52.177 --> 51:54.445
And yes,
the right's got the votes,

51:54.579 --> 51:56.181
and I'm sure
they will do their worst.

51:56.281 --> 51:57.615
But to state the obvious,

51:57.748 --> 51:59.617
you are not
Andrew fucking Johnson.

51:59.750 --> 52:03.421
And the last billion times
the GOP has tried to destroy us,

52:03.554 --> 52:05.923
we have wiped the floor
with them.

52:06.056 --> 52:07.592
Have you seen the polls?

52:07.692 --> 52:09.594
Every step
they take towards this

52:09.727 --> 52:13.698
moronic idea,
your approval jumps a point.

52:13.798 --> 52:15.466
Nobody's looking at the polls.

52:15.600 --> 52:17.802
My own party
isn't looking at the polls.

52:17.935 --> 52:20.605
They just need
permission to forgive you.

52:20.705 --> 52:23.441
Which is something
that you can't give them.

52:26.777 --> 52:28.279
But I can.

52:30.948 --> 52:33.117
This is all the FBI interviews?

52:33.218 --> 52:34.985
We're waiting on a few more.

52:35.119 --> 52:36.487
We have a problem.

52:36.621 --> 52:38.122
We need to put Monica back
under oath.

52:38.289 --> 52:40.791
- Why?
- Our perjury charge
rests on the president

52:40.958 --> 52:43.127
claiming that technically he
didn't have sex with her because

52:43.228 --> 52:44.895
he never touched her
with intent to arouse.

52:44.962 --> 52:47.632
He's lying,
but here's hours and hours

52:47.732 --> 52:49.634
of Monica's testimony,
and she never once

52:49.767 --> 52:51.236
speaks about all the times

52:51.302 --> 52:53.137
that he touched her
with intent to arouse.

52:53.238 --> 52:54.972
It was implied on our chart.

52:55.139 --> 52:58.309
That's weak shit. We need her
under oath, in detail,

52:58.443 --> 53:00.245
on all the sex,
proving him wrong.

53:00.311 --> 53:01.979
Okay, let's bring her back in.

53:02.079 --> 53:05.983
Gosh, who's going to
handle asking her about that?

53:07.318 --> 53:10.488
We are on the record.
Monica, you're still under oath.

53:11.522 --> 53:14.492
First, I want to start by
asking you a general question.

53:14.659 --> 53:16.527
Did your relationship
with President Clinton

53:16.661 --> 53:18.263
start with sex
and then evolve into

53:18.329 --> 53:19.997
a friendship
or the other way around?

53:21.666 --> 53:24.001
It started with
a physical attraction

53:24.101 --> 53:26.671
which led to
a sexual relationship.

53:26.771 --> 53:28.839
And then the emotional and...

53:28.939 --> 53:31.442
friendship aspects of
that relationship developed

53:31.509 --> 53:34.679
after the beginning of
the sexual relationship.

53:35.846 --> 53:37.848
Why don't we start
with the first incident

53:38.015 --> 53:40.117
of physical intimacy:
November 15, 1995,

53:40.184 --> 53:42.186
which you've already
testified some about.

53:42.287 --> 53:44.355
- Okay.
- Can you tell me

53:44.489 --> 53:46.123
how the physical intimacy
between you two

53:46.223 --> 53:47.458
began that night?

53:50.461 --> 53:51.862
Um...

53:53.130 --> 53:55.966
Well, we were, uh...

53:56.033 --> 53:58.703
in an office alone.

53:58.803 --> 54:00.871
Kissing, you know?

54:02.373 --> 54:05.376
And then what happened
after the kissing started?

54:07.645 --> 54:13.884
Um, he started
untucking my shirt.

54:13.984 --> 54:15.152
And then what?

54:18.556 --> 54:21.058
I'm sorry.
For legal reasons,

54:21.191 --> 54:24.228
I need to get
specifically what happened.

54:24.362 --> 54:25.930
Each physical interaction.

54:27.498 --> 54:28.899
Okay.

54:29.900 --> 54:32.236
Um...

54:32.370 --> 54:38.075
So, he took off my sweater
and, you know...

54:38.208 --> 54:40.177
Did he touch your breasts?

54:41.612 --> 54:44.515
- Yes.
- With your bra on or off?

54:48.085 --> 54:50.421
I...

54:50.521 --> 54:54.792
I-I... I don't
remember if I unhooked my bra

54:54.925 --> 54:57.962
or if he, um...

55:01.098 --> 55:03.968
...lifted my...

55:04.101 --> 55:06.637
bra up over--
This is embarrassing.

55:06.771 --> 55:08.105
I know.

55:08.205 --> 55:09.607
I'm sorry.

55:15.112 --> 55:16.547
But he...

55:17.782 --> 55:20.485
He lifted the bra over
your breasts.

55:20.618 --> 55:23.988
Um... sometimes...

55:27.625 --> 55:33.964
...he would lift my-my breasts
out of my bra. God.

55:34.131 --> 55:36.467
Did he touch your breasts
with his hands?

55:36.601 --> 55:37.635
Yes.

55:37.768 --> 55:39.637
Did he touch your breasts
with his mouth?

55:40.971 --> 55:43.140
- Yes.
- Did he touch your genital area?

55:47.745 --> 55:51.148
Uh, I-I know this is...

55:51.248 --> 55:53.651
It's just, um, thinking about
other people reading this...

55:53.751 --> 55:56.654
I understand,
but I've been instructed

55:56.821 --> 55:58.155
to question you
on these details.

55:58.255 --> 55:59.590
- And I have to answer?
- Pursuant to the agreement

55:59.657 --> 56:01.592
you have with this office, yes.

56:01.659 --> 56:03.160
Do you understand?

56:04.495 --> 56:06.330
- Yes.
- Okay.

56:07.832 --> 56:10.034
Did he touch your genitals
on this date?

56:12.102 --> 56:13.170
Yes.

56:13.270 --> 56:15.840
Can you describe
exactly how that happened?

56:18.676 --> 56:20.044
He, um...

56:29.353 --> 56:31.456
The president...

56:31.522 --> 56:35.059
uh, got a call, so we moved
into a back office.

56:37.628 --> 56:39.464
While he was on the phone...

56:42.533 --> 56:45.970
...he put his hand, uh,
down my pants and he...

56:46.036 --> 56:48.072
stimulated that area.

56:48.205 --> 56:50.374
Directly on your skin
or through underwear?

56:52.977 --> 56:56.046
It was, um, touching...

56:56.146 --> 56:59.216
through my underwear
at first and then he

56:59.349 --> 57:01.652
placed his hand
under my underwear.

57:01.719 --> 57:03.888
And did he bring you to orgasm?

57:07.725 --> 57:09.894
- Yes.
- Okay.

57:11.596 --> 57:14.599
On this night, did you perform
oral sex on the president?

57:14.732 --> 57:16.400
Yes.

57:18.268 --> 57:19.604
Who initiated that?

57:19.737 --> 57:21.405
I did.

57:22.607 --> 57:25.943
Did the president say
anything to you during this?

57:27.578 --> 57:28.913
No.

57:31.749 --> 57:33.117
He was on the phone.

57:36.754 --> 57:38.623
Would you like a break?

57:47.532 --> 57:50.367
<i>
Moving to March 31, 1996,</i>

57:50.434 --> 57:52.436
did the president
stimulate your genitals?

57:52.537 --> 57:53.938
Yes.

57:56.106 --> 57:58.375
Was that through clothing?

58:00.210 --> 58:01.946
Not through clothing.

58:02.079 --> 58:05.382
And he stimulated
your genitals with his hands?

58:05.449 --> 58:08.786
Yes. And...

58:11.388 --> 58:12.790
And?

58:14.959 --> 58:17.327
He used, um...

58:19.296 --> 58:21.131
He had a cigar.

58:24.969 --> 58:28.305
I'm sorry, could you speak just
a little louder for the tape?

58:28.405 --> 58:29.807
Okay, sorry.

58:29.907 --> 58:30.975
He had a cigar.

58:31.075 --> 58:33.310
Did he insert the cigar
into your vagina?

58:36.747 --> 58:38.649
I'm sorry, I'm gonna need you
to answer verbally.

58:38.749 --> 58:39.817
Yes.

58:41.986 --> 58:44.154
Whose idea, um...?

58:45.756 --> 58:47.157
How did that...?

58:48.492 --> 58:52.162
Um, we were talking, um,

58:52.262 --> 58:55.666
in the Oval Office...

58:55.766 --> 58:59.336
one day and he was,

58:59.503 --> 59:02.172
uh, he-he was chewing on a...

59:02.339 --> 59:06.844
cigar and he looked at it
in a sort of...

59:09.046 --> 59:12.783
...naughty way and I said,

59:12.850 --> 59:17.688
"We can do that sometime."
So we did.

59:18.789 --> 59:21.225
Did you understand it
to be arousing?

59:22.860 --> 59:24.895
- Yes.
- Then what happened?

59:35.372 --> 59:37.074
Um...

59:38.308 --> 59:42.713
He put it in his mouth.
He said it tasted good.

59:46.216 --> 59:48.653
Okay, I have
just one last question.

59:48.753 --> 59:50.387
It goes to your motivation.

59:52.056 --> 59:55.225
Do you for any reason
want to hurt the president?

59:57.227 --> 59:59.764
No, that's the last thing
I want.

59:59.897 --> 1:00:01.732
All right.

1:00:01.866 --> 1:00:05.402
Thank you.
You did really well, Monica.

1:00:06.937 --> 1:00:09.339
That's all I have.
I have to run this in.

1:00:09.439 --> 1:00:12.076
Pam can help you see
yourself out.

1:00:13.410 --> 1:00:15.579
Is it a boy or a girl?

1:00:18.115 --> 1:00:21.919
Uh... It's a boy.

1:00:22.019 --> 1:00:23.921
Mazel tov.

1:00:25.355 --> 1:00:27.457
For your sake,
I hope this is goodbye.

1:00:43.607 --> 1:00:48.112
I want the full report ready
for Congress by Labor Day.

1:00:48.245 --> 1:00:50.047
Judge, that's two weeks
from now.

1:00:50.114 --> 1:00:51.949
Any closer to the election
and it will

1:00:52.116 --> 1:00:54.118
appear like a political hit
on the Democrats.

1:00:54.218 --> 1:00:56.620
Brett, please make sure
everyone has their drafts in

1:00:56.721 --> 1:00:57.955
by September 4th.

1:00:58.122 --> 1:01:01.325
- Got it.
- Our FBI guys just
sent this 302.

1:01:01.458 --> 1:01:03.160
It's a new interview
with Jane Doe 5.

1:01:03.293 --> 1:01:05.629
Real name Juanita Broaddrick.
She's changing her statement.

1:01:05.796 --> 1:01:08.298
- What she's saying?
- That Bill Clinton raped her.

1:01:08.465 --> 1:01:11.301
This is that same woman who,
back in January,

1:01:11.401 --> 1:01:13.470
signed an affidavit saying
nothing ever happened.

1:01:13.637 --> 1:01:14.805
Right. Now she says
that was a lie.

1:01:14.972 --> 1:01:17.174
Why is she lying?
Was she coerced by the Clintons?

1:01:17.307 --> 1:01:19.977
- No.
- Was she offered something?

1:01:20.077 --> 1:01:22.479
No, no quid pro quo.
She's saying she lied at first

1:01:22.646 --> 1:01:24.148
because she didn't
want to be involved.

1:01:24.248 --> 1:01:26.817
She's had no contact with
Clinton people since the '80s.

1:01:26.917 --> 1:01:27.985
Well, if he didn't pressure her,

1:01:28.085 --> 1:01:29.486
then it doesn't go
to his criminality.

1:01:29.586 --> 1:01:32.156
Except for the raping.

1:01:32.256 --> 1:01:33.657
H-He raped her.

1:01:33.824 --> 1:01:36.493
We can't be cluttering
the report with all

1:01:36.593 --> 1:01:39.163
the various sexual experiences
from his past.

1:01:39.329 --> 1:01:41.365
Yeah, there's only so much
ink in the world, Sol.

1:01:41.498 --> 1:01:46.670
I just... Judge, read the 302,
read what he did.

1:01:49.940 --> 1:01:52.676
Perjury and obstruction
of justice.

1:01:52.843 --> 1:01:54.845
Those are our grounds
for impeachment,

1:01:55.012 --> 1:01:57.014
not some lady
who changes her mind

1:01:57.181 --> 1:01:58.348
about what happened one night.

1:01:58.515 --> 1:02:00.851
But...

1:02:03.287 --> 1:02:06.857
Okay. So, should we not
put her in the report at all?

1:02:06.957 --> 1:02:09.026
It can be an appendix
if you want.

1:02:09.126 --> 1:02:10.795
Put her in a footnote.

1:02:12.562 --> 1:02:13.697
Okay.
