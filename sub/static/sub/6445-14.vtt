WEBVTT

01:05.816 --> 01:08.853
-Lana, what's wrong?
-There's someone in the room.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.453
Clear.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.741
It's all clear, sir.

01:26.545 --> 01:28.035
Lex, over there.

01:43.896 --> 01:47.855
Check the roof and initiate a full
perimeter sweep of the grounds, Brady.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.099
Sir.

01:55.324 --> 01:56.939
Lana".

01:57.493 --> 01:59.484
...what did this guy look like?

01:59.661 --> 02:01.572
I don't know. I didn't see him.

02:01.747 --> 02:06.582
But I could just sense that there was
someone in the room with me.

02:09.379 --> 02:11.540
Can you close the window?

02:12.716 --> 02:14.581
Yeah.

02:18.889 --> 02:21.972
So you didn't actually see
or hear anyone?

02:22.142 --> 02:23.723
No.

02:27.397 --> 02:31.436
With the press tracking our every move,
it's easy to get a little paranoid.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.483
Maybe you're right.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.491
Maybe I just imagined the whole thing.

02:48.043 --> 02:50.079
Why not go downstairs?

02:50.254 --> 02:52.745
Get some tea to calm your nerves.

03:53.775 --> 03:57.984
The paparazzi's at a fevered pitch
and Lex jets off on a business trip.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.941
It's not like he left me unprotected.

04:00.115 --> 04:04.654
Well that explains why Lex's robo-cops
are patrolling outside.

04:04.828 --> 04:07.285
I can't believe he would leave
the country knowing...

04:07.456 --> 04:10.619
...that some demented stranger
broke into your bedroom.

04:12.169 --> 04:16.082
I let him believe
that it was paparazzi-induced jitters.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.126
You lied to Lex?

04:21.637 --> 04:24.174
I couldn't show him the photo
that was sent to me.

04:25.891 --> 04:29.304
Okay, ﬁrst of all, you're staying here
until we catch Norman Bates.

04:30.312 --> 04:31.768
And second...

04:32.356 --> 04:34.472
...I need to see that phone.

04:35.359 --> 04:38.522
Lana, it's the only way we're gonna
be able to track this guy down.

04:45.994 --> 04:50.283
I don't think Lex would've minded
a picture of you in your lingerie.

04:50.666 --> 04:52.531
It's the chisel.

04:54.211 --> 04:58.045
I think Lex stabbed Clark with it
after the engagement dinner.

05:05.138 --> 05:09.507
So all of the secrecy is about
that which we do not speak of.

05:09.685 --> 05:11.801
Chloe, l'm just—

05:11.979 --> 05:15.312
| just want your help catching this guy.

05:15.941 --> 05:19.149
I'll ﬁnd out the explanation
about Clark on my own.

05:31.498 --> 05:32.908
You're okay.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.039
Come on.

05:35.210 --> 05:36.791
-C|ark.
-All right. Come on.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.577
What are you still doing out here?

05:39.256 --> 05:41.747
Well, I'm still doing my chores.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.758
Well, you usually ﬁnish those
in about two minutes.

05:44.928 --> 05:49.137
How is it that I drove to Metropolis,
attended the Children's Foundation dinner...

05:49.307 --> 05:51.468
...and made it back before you ﬁnished?

05:51.643 --> 05:53.929
Because I'm doing them the normal way.

05:54.730 --> 05:58.063
Ever since I landed on the paparazzi's list
of ex-boyfriends to hound...

05:58.233 --> 06:01.566
...I feel someone's looking over my
shoulder. Like I'm being watched.

06:02.320 --> 06:07.314
I spent time trying to stay out of the
spotlight that pushing Lana into Lex's life...

06:07.492 --> 06:09.357
...put me right in the middle of it.

06:09.536 --> 06:13.745
Well, it's gotta be a lot warmer
in that spotlight than it is outside.

06:13.915 --> 06:16.327
I'm gonna go inside
and make some hot cocoa...

06:16.501 --> 06:19.117
...to thaw out the two of us
who can feel how cold it is.

06:19.296 --> 06:20.877
Thank you, Mrs. Kent.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.294
-Chloe, you look half frozen.
-Yeah.

06:24.468 --> 06:28.131
Shouldn't you be next to a ﬁre somewhere,
warming up next to Jimmy?

06:28.305 --> 06:30.466
I'm on a mocha-mint run for Lana.

06:30.640 --> 06:34.178
At least, that's what
I'm letting her believe.

06:34.352 --> 06:37.389
She is hiding out at my apartment.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.396
From what?

06:39.566 --> 06:41.807
Somebody who has taken
to breaking, entering...

06:41.985 --> 06:44.101
...and making obligatory
creepy phone calls.

06:45.447 --> 06:46.983
What's Lex doing about it?

06:47.157 --> 06:52.652
She has some very compelling reasons
for keeping him out of the picture.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.993
All right. I'll go back with you.
We can ﬁgure out--

06:57.167 --> 06:58.828
No, Clark, she's ﬁne. She's safe.

06:59.002 --> 07:01.618
She's got Lex's security guards there.
Believe me.

07:01.797 --> 07:04.379
No one's gonna go near her
without them knowing about it.

07:04.549 --> 07:07.291
-There's gotta be something I can do.
-There is.

07:07.844 --> 07:11.962
l traced the text message to a low-life
shutterbug named Louie Esposito.

07:12.140 --> 07:16.053
Now, there's no permanent address,
but Jimmy really knows that world.

07:16.228 --> 07:18.264
So can you call him
and ask him about it?

07:18.730 --> 07:19.719
-Call Jimmy?
-Yeah.

07:19.898 --> 07:21.513
Why don't you call him yourself?

07:22.192 --> 07:23.773
I can't.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.402
We sort of broke up.

07:32.619 --> 07:35.577
Does this have anything
to do with me and keeping my secret?

07:36.706 --> 07:38.082
No.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.874
And yes.

07:44.798 --> 07:48.256
You can't let this happen, Chloe.
My lies have pushed Lana away, and now—

07:48.426 --> 07:51.088
She's a lot closer than you think, Clark.

07:51.263 --> 07:53.925
This is the picture that creep sent
on her cell phone.

07:54.099 --> 07:55.805
Anything look familiar?

07:57.477 --> 07:59.308
It's my dad's chisel.

08:00.522 --> 08:03.559
-Did she see Lex stab me?
-She's doesn't know what she saw.

08:03.733 --> 08:07.567
But, Clark, she's been orbiting
your secret for years and I think...

08:07.737 --> 08:11.195
...she may ﬁnally be coming in
for a landing.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.663
Brady?

09:43.917 --> 09:45.123
Brady?

11:23.433 --> 11:26.425
Miss Lang. Right here.
There you go, there you go.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.218
-Yeah.
-Right here.

11:28.396 --> 11:31.479
-Miss Lang, what are you doing?
-There's someone in the building.

11:31.649 --> 11:35.267
No, that's impossible. Okay?
My men are guarding the building.

11:35.445 --> 11:36.776
Right here. Lana, Lana.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.653
Then how do you explain that?

12:05.266 --> 12:07.678
No. I live here, remember?

12:07.852 --> 12:08.967
What's going on?

12:09.145 --> 12:10.555
We got a serious problem here.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.985
Jimmy.

12:27.664 --> 12:30.656
Hey, Clark. Chloe's not here.

12:30.834 --> 12:33.951
I know. You're actually the one
I've been looking for.

12:35.839 --> 12:38.000
I had a feeling this was coming.

12:39.843 --> 12:41.174
Look...

12:41.344 --> 12:44.461
...Clark, despite our differences,
I think you're a decent guy.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.883
Chloe obviously thinks
that you can walk on air...

12:51.187 --> 12:53.143
...so who am I to stand in the way?

12:56.109 --> 12:57.440
Jimmy, hold on.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.646
Look, but if you hurt her...

12:59.821 --> 13:02.153
...I don't care
how impossibly gigantic you are...

13:02.323 --> 13:06.532
...I will chop you down like a cherry tree.
And that ain't no lie.

13:06.953 --> 13:10.946
It's nice to see that you'd risk ending up
in traction to protect Chloe's honor.

13:11.374 --> 13:14.912
A girl like that is worth spending
the rest of my life in a body cast.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.251
| feel the same the way.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.426
As her friend, nothing more.

13:22.594 --> 13:23.834
I swear.

13:26.556 --> 13:27.921
Now that you know that for sure...

13:28.099 --> 13:32.433
...maybe there's something between
the two of you you'd like to reconsider.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.435
Is that what you came here to tell me?

13:35.773 --> 13:38.310
Well, that, and I need your help.

13:39.277 --> 13:40.642
Lana's in trouble.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.447
So, what's the sitch?

13:43.615 --> 13:46.357
There's this paparazzi,
he's a little too into his job.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.150
I need to track him down
before he causes more damage.

13:49.329 --> 13:52.446
-You've worked with them before.
-It took a week to wash the slime.

13:52.624 --> 13:54.831
All I have is a name.
Can you help me track him?

13:55.001 --> 13:57.333
Anything for a friend of Chloe's.

13:58.213 --> 14:00.249
Grasping a knife,
leaving us all to wonder...

14:00.423 --> 14:04.291
...has Lana Lang ﬁnally cracked
from the pressure of marrying Lex Luthor?

14:06.262 --> 14:08.594
I turn on the news
and this is what I see?

14:08.765 --> 14:10.926
My ﬁance, scared
half out of her mind?

14:11.100 --> 14:13.261
We have the situation
under control, Mr. Luthor.

14:13.436 --> 14:16.553
Well, I'm sorry if I don't share
your optimistic assessment, Brady.

14:16.731 --> 14:19.598
l'm cutting my trip short.
Get Lana to LuthorCorp Plaza.

14:19.776 --> 14:24.270
If anyone you don't recognize gets within
a hundred yards of her, put a bullet in them.

14:25.448 --> 14:27.279
Understood, sir.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.032
Miss Lang, we have to go.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.947
-Go where?
-LuthorCorp.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.787
It's the only place
that I can guarantee your safety.

14:39.712 --> 14:43.125
Don't you think whoever's behind this
will think that's the place I'd go?

14:43.299 --> 14:46.666
-Yeah, that's the ﬁrst place I would look.
-Miss Lang.

14:47.512 --> 14:51.300
The only place I'll be safe
is the last one anyone would think I'd go.

14:52.976 --> 14:55.843
Change of plans, get the car ready.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.011
-But Mr. Luthor—
-lsn't here.

14:58.189 --> 15:01.056
Unless you're kidnapping me
and holding me against my will...

15:01.234 --> 15:02.565
...l'm gonna go where I want.

15:03.486 --> 15:06.444
And if you're interested
in my protection...

15:06.656 --> 15:08.396
...then you'll follow my orders now.

15:21.713 --> 15:25.877
The room is secured, Miss Lang. The rest
of the team is posted out on the grounds.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.165
Thank you.

15:27.343 --> 15:30.130
I'm gonna be right outside your door
if you need anything.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.345
I'm sorry.
I know this is a terrible intrusion.

15:36.519 --> 15:38.601
If you're taking the Luthor name,
I guess...

15:38.771 --> 15:41.729
...armed guards and dodging the press
go with the gold ring.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.728
Yeah, well, I'm hoping
it won't always be that way.

15:44.902 --> 15:47.735
Well, in this case,
that's not such a bad thing.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.645
Is there anything I can do for you?

15:49.824 --> 15:54.318
No, thank you. I'm just gonna turn in.
Are you sure that Clark won't mind?

15:54.996 --> 15:58.363
I think he'll survive a night on the couch.
I'll see you in the morning.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.532
-Good night.
-Good night.

18:11.799 --> 18:12.788
Who is this?

18:12.967 --> 18:14.673
You can't hide from me.

18:14.844 --> 18:18.883
Not even in Clark Kent's bedroom.
I know everything about you.

18:19.056 --> 18:22.184
I don't care what you know
or how you know it.

18:22.351 --> 18:26.139
There's an army between us and you're
never gonna get close enough to touch me.

18:26.314 --> 18:29.181
I 'rn closer than you think, princess.

18:32.028 --> 18:33.734
Brady.

19:16.781 --> 19:18.191
Why are you doing this?

19:18.366 --> 19:20.527
Because you deserve it.

19:40.972 --> 19:42.928
Hi, sweetheart. You're okay.

19:43.099 --> 19:45.681
We're in the hospital now
and you're in good hands.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.808
Mack called Dr. Langston.

19:47.979 --> 19:50.061
That was quite
a fail you took, Miss Lang.

19:50.231 --> 19:53.018
-All I care about is—
-The baby will be ﬁne.

19:55.361 --> 19:58.853
-Would you excuse us, please?
-Yes. I'll be outside.

20:00.992 --> 20:03.574
The thing I'm concerned about
is your blood pressure...

20:03.744 --> 20:05.780
...which is higher
than I'm comfortable with.

20:05.955 --> 20:08.617
So I'm gonna give you a sedative,
that'll bring it down.

20:08.791 --> 20:12.033
-No.
-No, it, it won't hurt the baby. I promise.

20:16.591 --> 20:18.422
-Thank you, nurse.
-You're welcome, sir.

20:38.321 --> 20:41.529
-How is she?
-Just a little shaken.

20:42.992 --> 20:45.074
I want her transferred to a secure room.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.111
Her life's still in danger
until we catch this guy.

20:48.289 --> 20:50.575
There might be a place
we can use in the old wing.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.332
Your team could completely secure
that area.

20:53.502 --> 20:54.491
Do it.

21:10.561 --> 21:13.394
-You sure this is the place?
-According to my sources...

21:13.564 --> 21:17.227
...this is the rock that Esposito crawls under
at the end of a long day.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.437
The parasite business
doesn't pay very well.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.523
Hey, don't shed any wet ones
for Esposito.

21:21.697 --> 21:24.734
At the top of his game, he's pulling
in a couple hundred K, easy.

21:24.909 --> 21:27.696
Just for taking pictures of people
who wanna be left alone?

21:27.870 --> 21:29.280
Who're you gonna blame more...

21:29.455 --> 21:32.162
...the guy snapping the pics
or the public that eats it up?

21:32.333 --> 21:35.370
Just because there's a market
for it does not make it right.

21:36.379 --> 21:37.368
Hey, check this out.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.507
Here, try this one.

21:50.267 --> 21:52.349
Looks like Esposito's deﬁnitely our guy.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.385
Wait a minute.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.773
Isn't that your barn?

22:03.197 --> 22:06.155
You two must have
something special, C.K.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.611
She's stalking you.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.248
Mom. Hi.

22:13.416 --> 22:15.657
I'm in Metropolis with Jimmy.

22:16.919 --> 22:18.659
I'll be right there.

22:19.839 --> 22:20.999
What's going on?

22:21.173 --> 22:24.290
Esposito attacked Lana.
I need to get to the hospital.

22:24.468 --> 22:27.756
Okay, well, we should grab the pics
because we might need them.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.348
C.K.?

23:46.967 --> 23:48.093
Hello?

23:48.260 --> 23:50.751
Lana, it's Chloe.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.012
Hey, I heard what happened.
Are you okay?

23:53.182 --> 23:56.549
Yeah, I'm ﬁne. I just don't know
where anyone--

24:00.481 --> 24:01.516
Lana?

24:29.176 --> 24:31.508
-What are you doing here?
-Yourjob.

24:44.859 --> 24:46.520
Come on. Let's go.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.148
Are you okay?

25:00.166 --> 25:01.281
What happened?

25:01.667 --> 25:03.248
He had a piece hidden on him.

25:03.711 --> 25:04.951
I didn't have a choice.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.089
It's over, Miss Lang.

25:22.897 --> 25:25.183
Let's get you back home
where you belong.

26:09.735 --> 26:11.646
Lex's plane's in the air now.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.902
But he won't be back
until tomorrow.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.155
With this snowstorm,
the plane was rerouted.

26:16.325 --> 26:17.815
Thank you...

26:18.661 --> 26:20.367
...for everything.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.653
If it wasn't for you...

26:22.831 --> 26:25.868
...I don't even wanna think
about what would've happened.

26:36.845 --> 26:40.178
I hope I'm not crossing a line.

26:42.309 --> 26:44.470
But honestly...

26:44.645 --> 26:47.261
...Lex never should have left you alone.

26:49.441 --> 26:52.683
When did you start calling him
by his ﬁrst name?

26:54.113 --> 26:55.193
I'm
sorry

26:55.364 --> 26:57.901
It's been a rough night.

26:58.075 --> 27:00.031
Yeah. I know.

27:00.202 --> 27:03.160
I don't think I've eaten
since this whole thing started.

27:03.330 --> 27:06.367
Could you ask the kitchen
to bring something up for me?

27:06.542 --> 27:10.126
I sent the staff
and the rest of the team home.

27:15.342 --> 27:18.049
I didn't want them
to get caught in the storm.

27:19.263 --> 27:22.380
-I know I should've asked you ﬁrst, but |--
-No, no, it's okay.

27:22.558 --> 27:24.799
It's actually very considerate.

27:26.854 --> 27:28.810
Like something you'd do.

27:30.566 --> 27:32.147
It's true.

27:33.152 --> 27:37.236
You're not like all the other girls
that Lex paraded in and out of here.

27:40.534 --> 27:42.240
Do you remember that line?

27:45.414 --> 27:48.577
Been crossing a lot of lines lately.

27:52.212 --> 27:54.339
All for you, princess.

28:01.597 --> 28:05.431
I watch over you every day.

28:06.685 --> 28:09.142
And you never even notice.

28:10.606 --> 28:13.939
You took that picture
of me in my bedroom.

28:15.694 --> 28:18.026
You're the one who's been calling.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.407
You killed Brady.

28:27.414 --> 28:29.575
I wasn't supposed to.

28:30.209 --> 28:33.997
He ﬁgured out that it had to be
someone on Lex's security team.

28:34.171 --> 28:37.459
I couldn't let him stop me
from saving you.

28:37.633 --> 28:39.794
Saving me?

28:39.968 --> 28:41.674
From who?

28:44.014 --> 28:46.346
That photographer you killed?

28:47.267 --> 28:50.350
Or was he just a part of all of this?

28:51.271 --> 28:53.307
He had a part to play.

28:54.274 --> 28:56.356
But your ex messed it up.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.903
I wanted to show you...

29:02.074 --> 29:05.157
...how far I was willing to go.

29:06.829 --> 29:10.413
You wanted to shoot him
in front of me, didn't you?

29:11.333 --> 29:14.621
But Clark stopped him
before you could get there.

29:15.546 --> 29:18.333
Lexis infecting you.

29:18.966 --> 29:21.503
You're starting to talk like him...

29:21.677 --> 29:26.216
...think like him.
It makes me sick what he's doing to you.

29:27.391 --> 29:29.347
But I can stop it.

29:30.644 --> 29:33.351
I can give you your life back.

29:37.901 --> 29:39.402
You're right.

29:40.571 --> 29:43.404
I never wanted any of this.

29:43.991 --> 29:46.858
I didn't know
what I was getting myself into.

29:47.035 --> 29:49.947
And now, I can't get out.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.205
Please.

29:56.378 --> 29:57.879
Help me.

30:03.093 --> 30:04.708
It's gonna be okay.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.048
I promise.

30:12.728 --> 30:14.719
I'm gonna save you.

30:48.805 --> 30:50.136
Why did you do that?

30:50.307 --> 30:51.797
Lana.

30:51.975 --> 30:53.431
Lana!

31:24.216 --> 31:25.831
Lana certainly is persistent.

31:26.009 --> 31:27.419
I'll give her that.

31:27.594 --> 31:30.927
Kind of like you were when you were
trying to ﬁgure out my secret.

31:31.682 --> 31:32.888
It just makes me wonder...

31:33.058 --> 31:37.142
...if she had an ulterior motive
in hiding out in your bedroom tonight.

31:38.855 --> 31:41.062
You think that's why
she went to my house?

31:41.233 --> 31:44.396
I'd like to believe that she went there
because she felt safe there.

31:44.570 --> 31:47.653
You don't spend this much time
with Lex without picking up tricks.

31:47.823 --> 31:51.987
Look at these pictures Esposito
took of her sneaking around your barn.

31:55.998 --> 31:58.159
Wait. What was that?

31:58.333 --> 31:59.493
That one right there.

32:02.462 --> 32:04.623
The Children's Foundation Beneﬁt.

32:04.798 --> 32:06.959
My mom was there last night.

32:07.134 --> 32:08.544
In Metropolis.

32:10.178 --> 32:13.670
So if Esposito took this--

32:14.141 --> 32:17.133
Then he couldn't have taken
that picture of Lana in her bedroom.

32:19.187 --> 32:20.518
Then who did?

32:37.748 --> 32:40.034
There's nowhere to go.

32:44.379 --> 32:46.165
It's too late to save you, Lana.

33:02.064 --> 33:03.520
You were a good person once.

33:04.733 --> 33:07.019
That's how I'll remember you
when you're gone.

33:37.099 --> 33:39.135
What happened?

33:39.309 --> 33:41.470
How did you—?

33:41.645 --> 33:43.761
You're safe now.

33:43.939 --> 33:45.770
That's all that matters.

33:46.233 --> 33:47.939
No, it isn't.

33:49.945 --> 33:52.652
You're here after...

33:52.823 --> 33:54.779
...everything.

33:58.245 --> 34:01.157
Why are you still watching over me?

34:04.292 --> 34:07.455
Maybe for the same reason
you've been watching me.

34:17.431 --> 34:20.719
So it's funny how the main streets
from here to Smallville...

34:20.892 --> 34:22.974
...miraculously thawed out over night.

34:23.145 --> 34:26.478
-You have anything to do with that?
-Nature is a mysterious creature.

34:26.648 --> 34:27.979
Have you talked to Lana?

34:28.150 --> 34:29.936
No, we danced to this tune before.

34:30.110 --> 34:32.817
I'm not playing pickle
in the middle anymore, remember?

34:32.988 --> 34:36.105
It's different. Lana's getting
too close to ﬁnding out my secret.

34:36.283 --> 34:37.819
I mean, what am I supposed to do?

34:37.993 --> 34:41.531
Clark, Lana risked her life
by not showing that photograph to Lex.

34:41.705 --> 34:43.491
She did that to protect you.

34:44.458 --> 34:47.825
I think she's proven
where her loyalty lies.

34:49.838 --> 34:51.624
Yo, C.K.

34:51.798 --> 34:55.461
Thanks for ﬁxing me up with a sucker's
cocktail in Esposito's dark room.

34:56.178 --> 34:59.841
| help you out, you leave me
holding the bag for a felony. That's great.

35:00.015 --> 35:02.381
I'm sorry. After I found out
what happened to Lana...

35:02.559 --> 35:04.595
...I just wanna make sure she was okay.

35:13.153 --> 35:14.859
Yeah, I can understand that urge.

35:18.408 --> 35:20.069
How is she?

35:21.328 --> 35:23.910
She's good, thanks to you.
You really came through.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.616
Yeah, thanks.

35:31.546 --> 35:33.411
You guys should catch up.

35:45.685 --> 35:48.347
You know, he's not such a bad guy.

35:49.523 --> 35:50.933
Yeah.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.392
But he's no Jimmy Olsen.

36:04.538 --> 36:06.449
Does that mean that you miss me?

36:21.805 --> 36:22.920
I know.

36:25.433 --> 36:26.764
Me too.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.375
God, I'm a lucky man.

37:03.179 --> 37:05.306
Lana".

37:05.473 --> 37:10.137
...I can't tell you how powerless
I felt not being able to help you.

37:15.483 --> 37:17.644
Everything's okay.

37:19.362 --> 37:20.738
We're okay.

37:23.199 --> 37:27.408
My security chief at LuthorCorp Plaza
said you never made it there.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.160
What happened?

37:34.044 --> 37:36.581
I went to the Kent farm instead.

37:37.464 --> 37:40.422
Lex, you weren't here
and I had to trust my instincts.

37:41.176 --> 37:43.212
You taught me that.

37:46.348 --> 37:50.341
And those instincts led you to the place
your ex-boyfriend happens to live?

37:53.730 --> 37:56.517
I went to the farm because
I thought it was the last place...

37:56.691 --> 37:58.943
...anyone would look for me.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.896
It's the only reason.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.368
Then that's good enough for me.

38:10.246 --> 38:11.782
Lana.

38:12.290 --> 38:15.373
Above anything else, I trust you.

38:17.545 --> 38:19.672
And I love you.

39:14.561 --> 39:17.428
Looks like you're working out
some issues there.

39:19.107 --> 39:21.439
Just doing a little honest work, Lex.

39:21.609 --> 39:23.440
You should try it some time.

39:24.446 --> 39:25.777
Why start now?

39:27.449 --> 39:28.689
My life's perfect.

39:31.453 --> 39:33.910
-What do you want?
-Nothing.

39:34.080 --> 39:37.572
| just wanted to take a little sleigh ride
down memory lane.

39:37.751 --> 39:39.287
Visit the scene of the crime.

39:40.086 --> 39:41.542
Hey...

39:41.713 --> 39:45.456
...here's where you took my ﬁancé
after kidnapping her.

39:45.633 --> 39:48.124
Right before you tried to kill me.

39:50.805 --> 39:53.262
I wasn't myself that night.

39:56.811 --> 39:57.846
I'm
sorry

39:59.439 --> 40:01.020
Sorry?

40:01.191 --> 40:03.307
What? That you didn't ﬁnish the job?

40:07.238 --> 40:09.354
You know, I'm still
a bit fuzzy on the details.

40:09.532 --> 40:12.319
What with you trying to choke
the life out of me.

40:12.494 --> 40:14.826
But what fascinates me...

40:14.996 --> 40:18.705
...is how after all that,
Lana could still feel safe coming here.

40:18.875 --> 40:20.490
That was her choice.

40:20.668 --> 40:22.659
-I had nothing to do with it.
-You never do.

40:24.214 --> 40:25.795
That's all right.

40:26.549 --> 40:31.669
You see, I understand the allure of trying
to unravel the mystery of Clark Kent.

40:32.222 --> 40:36.511
I suffered from it once too,
when I thought you mattered.

40:39.020 --> 40:40.760
Are we done?

40:43.817 --> 40:46.433
Nothing left but the formalities.

40:52.075 --> 40:54.862
Don't look so surprised, Clark.

40:55.036 --> 40:57.994
Lana still cares about you, I know that.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.406
And I know what it would mean to her,
having you there.

41:05.213 --> 41:07.078
Is that really what you want, Lex?

41:08.216 --> 41:09.877
What I want?

41:11.136 --> 41:15.300
What I want is to make Lana happy
for the rest of her life.

41:16.182 --> 41:19.595
And I want you to be there
on our wedding day...

41:20.395 --> 41:22.807
...to see what you lost.

41:26.234 --> 41:28.270
Make sure you RSVP.

41:28.444 --> 41:31.231
We need a head count for the reception.

42:15.950 --> 42:17.941
[ENGLISH]
