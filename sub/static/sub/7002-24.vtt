WEBVTT

00:03.202 --> 00:05.403
Ok, all right, all right.

00:05.404 --> 00:07.405
The moment has arrived.
Here we go.

00:07.406 --> 00:09.407
See if we can start
this thing.

00:09.408 --> 00:11.009
All right? Clear?
Everybody?

00:12.778 --> 00:13.845
<i>(engine turning over)</i>

00:13.846 --> 00:15.847
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:15.848 --> 00:18.249
Come on! Come on!

00:18.250 --> 00:19.818
Daah.

00:19.819 --> 00:22.487
Boy, listen
to that baby purr.

00:23.990 --> 00:27.525
Dad...
What did we do wrong?

00:27.526 --> 00:29.160
I don't know.

00:29.161 --> 00:31.830
Could be ignition,
could be distributor,
could be spark plugs.

00:31.831 --> 00:34.132
Could be you.

00:34.133 --> 00:36.300
Ease up, wing nut.

00:36.301 --> 00:39.137
Look... Clean up
some of these tools.

00:39.138 --> 00:41.539
I'm gonna take a break
and think about this.

00:49.515 --> 00:51.883
Tim! <i>(bangs on door)</i>

00:51.884 --> 00:53.384
Come on in.

00:53.385 --> 00:55.687
I can't. The doorknob's
still broken.

00:55.688 --> 00:57.188
You didn't fix it.

00:57.189 --> 01:00.558
It's not broken.
Lift it up to the right.
<i>(clunk)</i>

01:00.559 --> 01:01.960
Now, left, left. Up left.

01:01.961 --> 01:05.063
Pull it a little bit
and twist down on it.

01:05.063 --> 01:07.799
You gotta push a little,
push a little bit with it.

01:07.800 --> 01:10.702
You said "pull."
it's not brok...

01:10.703 --> 01:13.437
Well, now you broke it.

01:13.438 --> 01:16.141
You promised me you were
gonna fix that thing.

01:16.142 --> 01:17.909
I got my belt out.
I'm half done.

01:17.910 --> 01:20.845
That's you, tim.
You're always half done.

01:20.846 --> 01:23.347
We had three kids,
didn't we?

01:23.348 --> 01:25.717
We planned on six.

01:25.718 --> 01:28.419
Hey, where are you going
with the doorknob?
You gotta...

01:28.420 --> 01:30.555
Oh, you want to go
outside? Here.

01:30.556 --> 01:32.390
You are so pathetic.

01:32.391 --> 01:38.029
Look, look. This is you
doing household repairs.

01:40.066 --> 01:42.834
<i>(grunts)</i>

01:42.835 --> 01:45.436
You got a tool belt on.
Put a little more beef
in that grunt.

01:45.437 --> 01:47.371
<i>(deep grunt)</i>

01:47.372 --> 01:48.840
Better.

01:48.841 --> 01:50.842
All right. Jill asked me
to fix that doorknob,

01:50.843 --> 01:52.844
But before I do
any actual work,

01:52.845 --> 01:55.013
I'd better stop
and think about it

01:55.014 --> 01:57.716
For a couple of hours.

02:02.755 --> 02:05.323
Ok. Enough thinking.

02:05.324 --> 02:07.225
Now, gotta run to
the hardware store

02:07.226 --> 02:10.527
And buy hundreds of dollar''
worth of tools I don't need.

02:10.529 --> 02:12.263
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:12.264 --> 02:14.766
There's no such thing
as a tool I don't need.

02:14.767 --> 02:18.937
Ok, jill,
I bought my new tools.

02:18.938 --> 02:23.341
<i>(falsetto)</i> I can't believe
you bought another tool
you don't need.

02:23.342 --> 02:27.779
But, before I work,
I gotta clear my head.

02:27.780 --> 02:30.414
<i>(belches)</i>

02:30.415 --> 02:35.053
Boy, tim, I don't think
I've ever wanted you more.

03:44.356 --> 03:47.692
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

03:55.400 --> 03:56.901
Hey, gimme that!

03:56.902 --> 03:58.269
No!
I want it!

03:58.270 --> 04:00.271
Shut up!
Give it back!

04:00.272 --> 04:02.841
Hey, hey, hey, I'm trying to
work on the engine out here.
What's going on?

04:02.842 --> 04:06.244
Dad, tell mark to keep
his grubby hands out
of the cocoa busters.

04:06.245 --> 04:09.380
Mark!
But I want
the 3-d baseball cards.

04:09.381 --> 04:11.316
<i>(grunts)</i>

04:12.517 --> 04:14.986
3-d? I'll get 'em
out of there.

04:14.987 --> 04:16.654
They're not in there.

04:16.654 --> 04:19.324
You have to eat eight boxes
and send in the
proofs-of-purchase.

04:19.325 --> 04:21.492
For a normal family,
that would pose a problem,

04:21.493 --> 04:22.994
But we're taylors.

04:22.995 --> 04:24.929
Let's pig out.
Open those hoods.

04:28.234 --> 04:30.268
Very classy.

04:30.269 --> 04:32.436
And the good news is,
hon, they got 2%

04:32.437 --> 04:35.006
Of our daily
minimum requirement
of riboflavin.

04:35.007 --> 04:36.574
Whoa.

04:36.575 --> 04:38.142
Riboflavin.

04:38.143 --> 04:40.245
Can't get enough of that.

04:40.246 --> 04:43.114
Did you fix
this burner over here
on the stove yet, honey?

04:44.583 --> 04:46.450
I was just working
on the gas line.

04:46.451 --> 04:49.888
Oh.
Hey, dad, I just hooked up
the gas line to the hot rod.

04:49.889 --> 04:53.124
The hot rod?
Yeah.

04:53.125 --> 04:56.394
Get your brothers,
get upstairs,
get ready for school.

04:56.395 --> 04:57.929
Tim!

04:57.930 --> 05:00.598
I just haven't
finished it yet.
You haven't started.

05:00.599 --> 05:02.767
What about
the ice dispenser?

05:02.768 --> 05:05.169
It's fine.
Yeah. Fine.

05:05.170 --> 05:07.471
It doesn't make ice,
doesn't dispense.

05:07.472 --> 05:10.441
<i>(clunking noise)</i>

05:10.442 --> 05:12.743
You're not doing it right.

05:12.744 --> 05:14.812
You ease it in there.

05:14.813 --> 05:16.781
Two little taps here.

05:20.019 --> 05:22.287
I see.
So, to fill the glass,

05:22.288 --> 05:25.423
I just have to do that,
like, what, 60 or 70 times?

05:25.424 --> 05:27.258
There's a little
sprocket missing.

05:27.259 --> 05:29.327
I'll get it at
the hardware store
this afternoon.

05:29.328 --> 05:31.629
After I finish the motor.

05:31.630 --> 05:34.232
Tim, you know what
your problem is?
I think it's ignition.

05:34.233 --> 05:36.901
No. Your problem is
if a job isn't fun

05:36.902 --> 05:38.903
Or you can't power it up,

05:38.904 --> 05:40.905
You're not interested
in doing it.

05:40.906 --> 05:43.441
Honey, I've been trying to get
this thing going for 18 months.

05:43.442 --> 05:45.509
I know. You've been spending
every spare moment.

05:45.510 --> 05:49.613
I think the time is near.
This beast is ready to roar.

05:49.614 --> 05:52.216
So is this one.

05:52.217 --> 05:53.651
I tell you what.

05:53.652 --> 05:55.653
<i>I</i> am going to
fix the stove

05:55.654 --> 05:57.655
And <i>I</i> will fix
the ice dispenser.

05:57.656 --> 06:00.524
You are so cute.
You don't think
I can do it?

06:00.525 --> 06:03.027
No, I have a lot of faith
in a woman

06:03.028 --> 06:06.030
Who uses tool terms
like "whatchamacallit,"
"thingamajig"

06:06.031 --> 06:08.866
And my personal favorite -
"doohickey."

06:10.269 --> 06:12.770
Ok, you don't want me
to do the jobs?

06:12.771 --> 06:15.739
When are <i>you</i> going to
fix the ice dispenser?
Soon.

06:15.740 --> 06:17.541
When are you gonna
fix the burner?
Soon.

06:17.542 --> 06:19.043
When, tim? When?

06:19.044 --> 06:20.845
Soon, jill, soon.

06:20.846 --> 06:24.215
So, what? You're just gonna
wait until the burner backs up

06:24.216 --> 06:25.984
And the whole house explodes?

06:25.985 --> 06:28.519
We've survived explosions
before, huh?

06:40.165 --> 06:41.799
<i>(mouths)</i>

06:41.800 --> 06:43.301
Hi. Welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

06:43.302 --> 06:45.903
This is one of our favorite
weeks of the year, right, al?

06:45.904 --> 06:47.438
That's right, tim.

06:47.439 --> 06:50.608
It's our annual lawn care week
right here on <i>tool time.</i>

06:53.612 --> 06:56.280
And, you know, you're judged
by the lawn you keep.

06:56.281 --> 06:58.949
Guys, we want people driving
by our house and going,

06:58.950 --> 07:01.452
"hey, there's a nice lawn.
A real man lives there."

07:01.453 --> 07:03.454
But the women
don't seem to care.

07:03.455 --> 07:05.456
They just drop
their thighmasters and go,

07:05.457 --> 07:08.626
"hey, get out there
and cut the grass, will ya?"

07:08.627 --> 07:12.163
'cause women don't understand.
We do not "cut the grass."

07:12.164 --> 07:14.598
We mow the lawn.

07:14.599 --> 07:18.136
We feed it, we pamper it,
we nurture it.

07:18.137 --> 07:21.105
We caress it.

07:21.106 --> 07:23.474
Al. <i>(whistles)</i> al.

07:26.311 --> 07:28.879
It's a piece of sod.

07:28.880 --> 07:31.549
You're not
on shore leave, fella.

07:31.550 --> 07:33.884
Well, as you can see,

07:33.885 --> 07:37.522
We have several types
of grass here for you
to consider.

07:37.523 --> 07:39.890
Bermuda.
Beautiful for shade.

07:39.891 --> 07:42.293
Kentucky bluegrass.
Thick and robust.

07:42.294 --> 07:45.829
And regular fescue.

07:45.830 --> 07:47.831
Do you suppose if this grass
had an emergency,

07:47.832 --> 07:50.568
It'd call, "fescue, 9-1-1?"

07:54.139 --> 07:56.507
My guess would be "no."

07:56.508 --> 08:00.010
Why don't we tell the folks
what we have coming up
on lawn care week.

08:00.011 --> 08:02.513
Well, tim, tomorrow,
we'll be doing our salute...

08:02.514 --> 08:03.714
<i>(cutting noise)</i>

08:03.715 --> 08:05.516
...To clippers.

08:05.517 --> 08:07.518
On Wednesday, we'll be
doing our salute...

08:07.519 --> 08:08.619
<i>(chh-chh-chh-chh)</i>

08:08.620 --> 08:10.521
...To sprinklers.

08:10.522 --> 08:13.691
But today, we're doing
our salute...
<i>(moo)</i>

08:13.692 --> 08:16.094
...To fertilizer.

08:18.697 --> 08:20.531
We salute cow dung today

08:20.532 --> 08:23.033
Because it's a major component
in all fertilizers,

08:23.034 --> 08:25.536
And cow dung helps keep
your lawn healthy and vibrant.

08:25.537 --> 08:27.605
Al? Take over,
I'll be right back.

08:27.606 --> 08:28.939
That's right, folks.

08:28.940 --> 08:30.441
So, as you can see,

08:30.442 --> 08:32.775
We have many different types
of fertilizer for you,

08:32.777 --> 08:34.611
And I'm sure
your local nursery

08:34.613 --> 08:36.614
Will be able to help you
choose the fertilizer

08:36.615 --> 08:38.116
For your particular needs.

08:38.116 --> 08:40.918
Or you can cut out
the middleman, al,

08:40.919 --> 08:43.254
And go right to the source.

08:43.255 --> 08:47.057
<i>(cheers and applause)</i>

08:50.795 --> 08:51.895
Yee-ha!

08:54.966 --> 08:56.967
"open and close the shutter

08:56.968 --> 08:59.270
By twisting
the air shutter screw."

08:59.271 --> 09:02.607
Well, how am I supposed
to open and shut it
if I don't know what it is?

09:02.608 --> 09:05.709
This can't be the air shutter
thing here, because there's
no screw in it.

09:05.710 --> 09:09.813
I'm home, guys. Think I got
the right parts for the rod.
What are you doing?

09:09.814 --> 09:13.151
I got tired of nagging you
to fix it, so I'm gonna
fix it myself.

09:13.152 --> 09:15.653
Honey, you don't know
what you're doing.
You're making a mess.

09:15.654 --> 09:18.989
You're gonna wreck
this thing.
Nag, nag, nag.

09:18.990 --> 09:20.324
Phew!

09:20.325 --> 09:23.628
Dad, you stink.
Light a match, huh?

09:27.065 --> 09:29.066
It's not me, wise guy.

09:29.067 --> 09:31.569
We did a little salute
to fertilizer on <i>tool time.</i>

09:31.570 --> 09:34.004
I got to ride a cow.

09:34.005 --> 09:36.507
Why? Was the pig
in the shop?

09:39.378 --> 09:42.613
Maybe it was in
for its 20,000-oink checkup.

09:42.614 --> 09:47.218
Or it was having
its <i>porking</i> brake fixed.

09:47.219 --> 09:50.188
<i>(laughing)</i>

09:52.357 --> 09:55.193
Is there a two-drink minimum
in here?

09:56.662 --> 09:58.829
Honey, go on upstairs
and wash up,

09:58.830 --> 10:01.965
'cause at 6:00 on tv
they're showing <i>porky and bess.</i>

10:03.134 --> 10:04.768
Thanks.
Later.

10:05.904 --> 10:08.306
<i>(scoffs)</i> what is this?

10:08.307 --> 10:11.242
I made a tool belt.

10:11.243 --> 10:13.043
No, no, no.

10:13.044 --> 10:16.447
A man's tools do not sit
next to frills and flowers.

10:16.448 --> 10:18.449
Do you see any frills
on this apron?

10:18.450 --> 10:19.750
What is that?
A flower.

10:19.751 --> 10:21.252
Great. Can I borrow that?

10:21.253 --> 10:23.588
I'd like to take that
down to a construction site.

10:23.589 --> 10:25.923
"hey, tim, I love the frills
and flowers on that belt.

10:25.924 --> 10:29.093
You know, those tulips
really bring out the blue
in your eyes."

10:29.094 --> 10:32.062
This would have been
a real simple project.

10:32.063 --> 10:35.766
Now you screwed up, it'll
take me three times as long.
Cry me a river!

10:35.767 --> 10:39.403
If you'd fixed this in
the first place, we wouldn't
have this problem, would we?

10:39.404 --> 10:41.472
So it's my fault
that you screwed it up?

10:41.473 --> 10:43.474
Hey, this is
no more screwed up

10:43.475 --> 10:45.909
Than it was
before you didn't fix it.

10:47.546 --> 10:49.714
I really want to argue
with that,

10:49.715 --> 10:52.383
But I have no idea
what you just said to me.

10:52.384 --> 10:54.485
I'm gonna just call
a repairman.

10:54.486 --> 10:56.820
Don't call a repairman.
I'll fix it.

10:56.821 --> 10:59.857
I am calling a repairman,
and I'm going to request
a big tall hunk

10:59.858 --> 11:04.862
With tight jeans
and the sleeves
torn off his t-shirt.

11:04.863 --> 11:06.096
Don't bother.

11:06.097 --> 11:08.432
After dinner,
I'll get all buffed up,

11:08.433 --> 11:10.934
Put on my tool belt,
rip off my sleeves,

11:10.935 --> 11:15.105
And you and I can play
"buck and betsy fix the stove."

11:15.106 --> 11:19.209
So, are buck and betsy gonna
fix the ice dispenser, too?

11:19.210 --> 11:21.779
There's nothing wrong
with the ice dispenser.

11:21.780 --> 11:23.781
Set the glass,
ease it in.

11:23.782 --> 11:25.048
Hit it.

11:33.558 --> 11:35.058
<i>(jill)</i> how's it going, gus?

11:35.059 --> 11:37.561
Just fine. I'll be done
with the stove in a jiffy.

11:37.562 --> 11:39.563
Then I'll get
the ice dispenser.

11:39.564 --> 11:41.231
Ice! I'll have ice.

11:41.232 --> 11:43.901
Little frozen cubes
of water.

11:43.902 --> 11:47.405
I've waited so long.
Thank you, gus.
My pleasure.

11:47.406 --> 11:49.407
I could clean out
these ignition holes
in the burner

11:49.408 --> 11:50.908
If you have a pipe cleaner.

11:50.909 --> 11:53.243
I got some in the garage.
I'll be right back.

11:53.244 --> 11:55.379
<i>(tim)</i> honey, I'm home.
Hi!

11:55.380 --> 11:56.614
So, how was your day?

11:56.615 --> 11:59.116
Fine. Thanks for asking.

11:59.117 --> 12:02.620
Jill, the mustache
is different.

12:02.621 --> 12:04.054
<i>(laughs)</i>

12:04.055 --> 12:07.090
Tim "the tool man" taylor.
You're even funny without al.

12:07.091 --> 12:10.027
<i>(fakes laugh)</i>
I see...

12:10.028 --> 12:12.363
I see you met gus.
Here you go.

12:12.364 --> 12:14.532
Gus is almost finished
repairing the stove.

12:14.533 --> 12:17.702
<i>(teeth gritted)</i>
you hired a repairman.
Yes, I did.

12:17.703 --> 12:21.004
I hope my work
gets the tim taylor
seal of approval.

12:21.005 --> 12:23.006
Well, let's see
what you did.

12:23.007 --> 12:25.776
Ok. I adjusted the screws
on the gas line,

12:25.777 --> 12:27.678
Checked the electronic
ignition switch

12:27.679 --> 12:29.480
And replaced
the burner manifold assembly.

12:29.481 --> 12:31.915
Yeah, just what
I woulda done.

12:34.586 --> 12:36.920
Wait till all the guys
down at the shop

12:36.921 --> 12:38.922
Hear that
tim "the tool man" taylor

12:38.923 --> 12:41.492
Needed me to do
his household repairs.

12:41.493 --> 12:43.527
Well, you don't really need
to spread that around.

12:43.528 --> 12:46.330
Are you kidding?
I'm gonna tell everyone I know.

12:46.331 --> 12:48.332
Jill, can I speak to you
in the garage

12:48.333 --> 12:50.334
Just for a moment?
Excuse us, gus.

12:50.335 --> 12:52.202
Excuse us.

12:52.203 --> 12:53.704
How'd you find him?

12:53.705 --> 12:56.206
How do you know what kind
of quality work he does?

12:56.207 --> 12:58.509
What do you know
about the guy?
That's why I called al.

12:58.510 --> 13:00.511
He recommended him
very highly.

13:00.512 --> 13:01.945
What?

13:01.946 --> 13:04.682
You told al I needed
a repairman in my own home?

13:04.683 --> 13:07.117
Well, he didn't laugh
that long.

13:08.286 --> 13:10.821
He's gonna blab it
all over <i>tool time.</i>

13:10.822 --> 13:12.890
What am I supposed to say
to my die-hard fans?

13:12.891 --> 13:16.126
Put them both in
the front seat of the car
and tell them the truth.

13:19.631 --> 13:23.133
Mrs. Taylor,
I've g...

13:23.134 --> 13:25.068
Whoa.

13:25.069 --> 13:26.904
Are you
building this?

13:26.905 --> 13:28.606
Yeah.
Come on, gus.

13:28.607 --> 13:30.775
Let's go back and get
this ice dispenser
done now.

13:30.776 --> 13:33.711
Yeah, in a minute,
mrs. Taylor.

13:33.712 --> 13:35.279
Are those
harley carbs?

13:35.280 --> 13:38.015
Yeah. You into rods?

13:38.016 --> 13:40.017
I'm building a vicky
in my backyard.

13:40.018 --> 13:42.019
No kidding.
Yeah, this is a chevy 350.

13:42.020 --> 13:44.988
I bored it out to 383.
I got a 400 crank in there.
Wow.

13:44.989 --> 13:48.225
Isn't that fascinating?
Come on, gus.

13:48.226 --> 13:50.728
Let's go get to work
on that freezer now,
all right?

13:50.729 --> 13:52.296
Yeah, in a minute.

13:52.297 --> 13:54.799
You must be close to
getting this started, huh?
Actually, I did.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.801
I gapped my plugs different
than I was supposed to

13:56.802 --> 13:58.803
And I put a new curb
on the distributor,

13:58.804 --> 14:00.805
But I can't get it
turned over right.

14:00.806 --> 14:02.139
Let me hear it.
Really?

14:02.140 --> 14:03.908
Yeah.
Hold on.

14:03.909 --> 14:06.376
<i>(engine turns over)</i>

14:06.377 --> 14:09.880
You might have your
ignition switch wires
on backwards.

14:09.881 --> 14:12.550
Yeah. Never thought
of that. Maybe I do.

14:12.551 --> 14:15.185
Here, I'll give you
a hand.
All right!

14:15.186 --> 14:16.987
Gus, gus, gus! Gus!

14:16.988 --> 14:19.490
No, don't worry, mrs. Taylor.
I'm taking you off the clock.

14:19.491 --> 14:20.858
There you go, hon.

14:28.900 --> 14:31.602
How long you had
that vicky?
Two years.

14:35.674 --> 14:38.275
Hi, wilson.
Hi-ho, tim.

14:38.276 --> 14:41.111
You know, I just saw
a repair truck pull away.
You got problems?

14:41.112 --> 14:44.682
No, jill called a repairman
to fix the stove
and the ice dispenser.

14:44.683 --> 14:46.484
Mm. Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm.

14:46.485 --> 14:49.854
I could've fixed both of them,
but I just found out about
the ice dispenser.

14:49.855 --> 14:53.824
I thought you had mentioned
that faulty ice dispenser
to me three weeks ago.

14:53.825 --> 14:57.394
Gee whiz, wilson, you don't
have to jump all over me.

14:57.395 --> 14:59.062
Well, I'm sorry, tim.

14:59.063 --> 15:01.064
The repairman didn't
even fix the stove.

15:01.065 --> 15:03.400
I got him kind of sidetracked
on the hot rod.

15:03.401 --> 15:05.903
Lot of good that did.
I still can't start the thing.

15:05.904 --> 15:07.371
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm-hmm.

15:07.372 --> 15:10.040
Jill said I was being
irresponsible.
I see.

15:10.041 --> 15:12.576
I'm not irresponsible.
I do a lot of chores
around here.

15:12.577 --> 15:14.578
I help raise the kids,
even cook dinner sometimes.

15:14.579 --> 15:16.580
I never get credit
for that stuff.

15:16.581 --> 15:19.016
Why should you?
Aah!

15:19.017 --> 15:21.418
All that stuff
you're supposed to do anyway.

15:21.419 --> 15:23.253
Don't sneak up
on me, please.

15:23.254 --> 15:27.157
Wilson, I've been trying
to get him to fix that stove
for 3 1/2 weeks.

15:27.158 --> 15:29.159
That's why I called
the repairman.

15:29.160 --> 15:31.361
I was gonna do it. You just
didn't give me the time.

15:31.362 --> 15:33.864
You don't want me to nag you
about doing the jobs,

15:33.865 --> 15:36.667
Don't want to do the jobs,
don't want me to call
a repairman.

15:36.668 --> 15:38.669
What am I supposed to do?

15:38.670 --> 15:41.271
Wilson, jump in any time.

15:41.272 --> 15:43.273
I'm here for you, tim,

15:43.274 --> 15:46.677
But this time you haven't
got a leg to stand on.

15:46.678 --> 15:49.212
What is this,
gang up on tim day?

15:49.213 --> 15:51.214
What is it with men, wilson?

15:51.215 --> 15:54.217
They'll spend hours
on an engine, putting up
a satellite dish,

15:54.218 --> 15:57.421
But they won't take five minutes
and fix a simple little
doorknob.

15:57.422 --> 16:00.057
Well, jill,
I find your question
astute and sagacious.

16:00.058 --> 16:02.726
Give it to her,
wilson.

16:02.727 --> 16:05.729
That's a compliment, tim.

16:05.730 --> 16:08.331
See, jill, historically,
men have been drawn to the jobs

16:08.332 --> 16:10.333
That bring them
attention and glory,

16:10.334 --> 16:12.670
Like discovering new lands
or winning wars.

16:12.671 --> 16:14.672
Women, however,
have been expected

16:14.673 --> 16:17.074
To work quietly and steadily
to maintain the home.

16:17.075 --> 16:19.076
But that's
a long time ago, wilson.

16:19.077 --> 16:20.578
I mean, times are changing.

16:20.579 --> 16:23.246
Women are working,
men are staying at home,
both are working.

16:23.247 --> 16:24.648
Roles are reversing.

16:24.649 --> 16:26.884
Trenchant
and perspicacious.

16:29.554 --> 16:33.256
Now, that can't possibly
be a compliment.

16:33.257 --> 16:36.326
I'm afraid so, tim.
Oh, you did it
to me again.

16:36.327 --> 16:37.895
Thank you, wilson.

16:37.896 --> 16:39.396
A wise man once said,

16:39.397 --> 16:41.899
"every job
has one thing in common -

16:41.900 --> 16:45.202
It has to be done
and it has to be done well."

16:45.203 --> 16:48.305
Well, that's kinda nice.
Who said that?

16:48.306 --> 16:49.339
You did.

16:51.275 --> 16:54.211
<i>(deep voice)</i> I used to be
a pretty smart fella.

16:57.548 --> 17:01.184
Well, it took a while,
but these babies are sharp.

17:01.185 --> 17:03.220
Why, you could cut
a lamb so close,

17:03.221 --> 17:06.757
It'd have to join
the hair club for sheep.

17:06.758 --> 17:09.926
"I'm not just a sheep,

17:09.928 --> 17:11.895
I'm also the president."

17:13.964 --> 17:15.699
I don't know, tim.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.835
That was pretty baa-d.

17:22.641 --> 17:25.142
Actually, though, when you
do sharpen these at home,

17:25.143 --> 17:27.144
It gives you a great deal
of satisfaction,

17:27.145 --> 17:29.246
But it also takes
an awful lot of hard work.

17:29.247 --> 17:32.249
That's true, which brings us
to the <i>tool time</i> tip of the day.

17:32.250 --> 17:34.251
Every job
has one thing in common -

17:34.252 --> 17:36.754
It must be done
and it must be done well.

17:36.755 --> 17:38.756
You know who said that,
don't you?

17:38.757 --> 17:41.591
Yes, I do. I told you that
last year.

17:44.129 --> 17:45.696
<i>(muttering)</i>
you did not.

17:45.697 --> 17:47.264
<i>(mutters)</i>
yes, I did.

17:47.265 --> 17:49.399
No, you didn't.
<i>(normal voice)</i>
yes, I did.

17:49.400 --> 17:50.400
<i>(normal voice)</i>
did not.
Did too.

17:50.401 --> 17:52.502
Not!
Did! Too.

17:54.405 --> 17:56.406
Remember...

17:56.407 --> 17:58.742
A real man finishes
any job he starts,

17:58.743 --> 18:01.578
Even if it may be tedious
or have no glory, right, al?

18:01.579 --> 18:02.913
That's true, tim.

18:02.914 --> 18:05.082
Took me almost a half-hour
to sharpen these

18:05.083 --> 18:07.584
So you could come out,
file them for ten seconds

18:07.585 --> 18:09.553
And take the credit.

18:11.756 --> 18:13.590
We have
a very special guest here,

18:13.591 --> 18:16.193
And I expect a very big
<i>tool time</i> welcome

18:16.194 --> 18:18.562
For hedge-clipping specialist
jim lester.

18:18.563 --> 18:20.164
Let's give it up.

18:21.833 --> 18:24.301
Good to have you
here, jim.
Good to be here, tim.

18:24.302 --> 18:26.136
Al.
Jim.

18:27.205 --> 18:29.773
Thank you, lisa.

18:29.774 --> 18:32.076
You're welcome, tim.

18:36.181 --> 18:37.681
Anyway, jim's gonna share

18:37.682 --> 18:40.084
Some trade secrets
of hedge clipping,
right, jim?

18:40.085 --> 18:41.685
That's right, tim.

18:41.686 --> 18:45.522
I always use a string
as a guide to give the hedge
a nice straight line.

18:45.523 --> 18:47.191
That's good advice.
Good advice.

18:47.192 --> 18:49.026
And for that particular job,

18:49.027 --> 18:53.530
Jim would be using
the binford shd 6500
hedge clippers.

18:53.531 --> 18:55.532
Shd - that's
super heavy-duty.

18:55.533 --> 18:58.001
<i>(grunts)</i>

18:58.002 --> 19:00.503
There's a lot of creative ways
to trim your hedges,

19:00.504 --> 19:02.505
And jim has been nice enough

19:02.506 --> 19:05.175
To bring out some examples
of his very nice work.

19:05.176 --> 19:07.177
Now, tim, these
are called topiaries.

19:07.178 --> 19:09.346
Each one takes hundreds
of man-hours

19:09.347 --> 19:11.181
To shape and cultivate

19:11.182 --> 19:13.283
And up to five years
to grow.

19:13.284 --> 19:15.919
Five years? <i>(whistles)</i>

19:15.920 --> 19:17.955
I guess
that's why they say...

19:17.956 --> 19:20.824
<i>♪ it's a long way</i>
<i>to topiary</i>

19:20.825 --> 19:23.761
<i>♪ it's a long way</i>
<i>to go, go, go ♪</i>

19:27.832 --> 19:30.968
I understand that you...
What...?

19:30.969 --> 19:32.302
<i>(sniffs)</i>

19:32.303 --> 19:33.971
<i>(sneezes)</i>

19:33.972 --> 19:37.775
Excuse me. I must be allergic
to something in here. Oh.

19:37.776 --> 19:39.042
Anyway. Thanks, al.

19:39.043 --> 19:41.611
So, I understand you do
a lot of this trimming by hand.

19:41.612 --> 19:44.114
Yes, I do,
and with pruning shears.

19:44.115 --> 19:46.316
Want me to trim
a little bit for you?

19:46.317 --> 19:48.652
You'd better not.
It takes a lot of experience.

19:48.653 --> 19:51.655
But I'll demonstrate
some shaping on the elephant

19:51.656 --> 19:54.124
With my pruning shears.

19:54.125 --> 19:55.692
<i>(sneezes)</i>

20:04.135 --> 20:06.904
And... There you have it.

20:06.905 --> 20:09.406
Hey, very,
very interesting, jim,

20:09.407 --> 20:11.541
And I really appreciate
you being here.

20:11.542 --> 20:15.145
And we'll be right back
after these messages
from binford tools.

20:28.426 --> 20:30.928
How you doing, hon?
<i>(grunts)</i>

20:30.929 --> 20:32.262
<i>(laughs)</i>

20:32.263 --> 20:35.833
What we have here
is a binford series z

20:35.834 --> 20:39.203
Dual spring-action
circulating, rotating doorknob.

20:39.204 --> 20:41.872
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

20:41.873 --> 20:44.641
This bad boy can turn to
the left, turn to the right

20:44.642 --> 20:48.345
And open without falling off.

20:48.346 --> 20:49.713
Good job.

20:49.714 --> 20:52.549
Nice going, mom.
Thank you. I did it
all myself.

20:52.550 --> 20:54.184
She did it pretty well, dad.

20:54.185 --> 20:56.186
She did. Maintaining a home
is teamwork.

20:56.187 --> 20:58.021
I help your mom,
she helps me.

20:58.022 --> 21:00.023
That's how we get
the chores done.
Right.

21:00.024 --> 21:02.192
Did you get
the ice dispenser fixed?

21:02.193 --> 21:05.863
I not only fixed it,
I made an improvement.
Boys, stand back.

21:10.301 --> 21:13.103
Tim, this is my
vacuum cleaner hose.

21:13.104 --> 21:15.973
I cleaned it out, and now
it's tim taylor's party tube.

21:15.974 --> 21:19.309
<i>(upper-crust voice)</i>
buffy, muffy, can I
freshen that drink?

21:19.310 --> 21:21.311
<i>(laughs)</i>

21:23.447 --> 21:25.849
<i>(normal voice)</i>
maybe my young son wants
a drink at the couch.

21:25.850 --> 21:27.351
Go long, brad.

21:29.153 --> 21:30.820
Yes!

21:30.821 --> 21:32.822
Yeah!
All right!

21:35.260 --> 21:39.429
Brad and I
regapped the plugs,
fixed the ignition.

21:39.430 --> 21:42.799
I'm ready
to start the engine.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.968
<i>(clears throat)</i>

21:44.969 --> 21:47.271
What's the matter, honey?
Aren't you gonna start it?

21:47.272 --> 21:48.838
I got goose bumps.

21:48.839 --> 21:50.540
You want me
to start it?

21:50.541 --> 21:54.144
No, no, no. I just want
to savor the moment.

21:54.145 --> 21:56.213
You know, this idea
started in my head,

21:56.214 --> 21:59.316
And piece by piece,
the parts started to roll in.

21:59.317 --> 22:01.584
For the engine
or your head?

22:03.154 --> 22:04.554
No, no, no.

22:14.665 --> 22:17.700
So much for savoring the moment
with my loved ones.

22:17.701 --> 22:21.704
It's time to bring
the sleeping beast to life.

22:47.832 --> 22:51.001

You got a cold beer?
