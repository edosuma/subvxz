07:34.333 --> 07:38.291
Your syrup, give it to me, now!

07:38.333 --> 07:39.750
- Stop that.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.750
That's mine.

07:39.792 --> 07:42.250
- Fine. But I'll be back.

07:42.291 --> 07:44.625
- Oh, waffles. Nice.

07:44.667 --> 07:46.333
- That's mine too.

07:46.375 --> 07:48.834
- Nom-nom-nom-nom-nom...

07:48.875 --> 07:50.709
- Why do you have

07:48.875 --> 07:50.709
to chew like that?

07:50.750 --> 07:52.959
- It means

07:50.750 --> 07:52.959
I'm enjoying my food.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.583
Nom-nom-nom-nom...

07:54.625 --> 07:56.834
- Sounds good.

07:54.625 --> 07:56.834
I want one.

07:56.875 --> 07:58.667
Oh.

07:58.709 --> 08:01.041
both: Nom-nom-nom...

08:01.083 --> 08:03.083
- Ooh. That means

08:01.083 --> 08:03.083
I'm enjoying my food.

08:03.125 --> 08:06.583
- Well, now I'm not enjoying

08:03.125 --> 08:06.583
my food.

08:06.625 --> 08:08.834
- Well, then you should be

08:06.625 --> 08:08.834
chewing like this.

08:08.875 --> 08:10.583
[both chewing loudly]

08:10.625 --> 08:13.208
- I want in on this.

08:10.625 --> 08:13.208
Hold on.

08:13.250 --> 08:16.083
all:

08:13.250 --> 08:16.083
Nyach-nyach-nyach-nyach-nyach...

08:16.125 --> 08:18.417
- What is wrong

08:16.125 --> 08:18.417
with you people?

08:18.458 --> 08:20.417
- Sometimes I have

08:18.458 --> 08:20.417
too good of a hair day,

08:20.458 --> 08:23.166
but besides that,

08:20.458 --> 08:23.166
I'm pretty happy with myself.

08:23.208 --> 08:24.750
- You three have no manners,

08:24.792 --> 08:26.583
no sense

08:24.792 --> 08:26.583
of the proper way to act,

08:26.625 --> 08:29.291
and you wouldn't know

08:26.625 --> 08:29.291
Michigan grass from your elbow.

08:29.333 --> 08:30.709
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:30.750 --> 08:32.500
Let's not bring Michigan

08:30.750 --> 08:32.500
into this.

08:34.792 --> 08:37.375
- Wow, Ricky, I didn't realize

08:34.792 --> 08:37.375
you were the expert on manners

08:37.417 --> 08:38.709
and the proper way to act.

08:38.750 --> 08:40.417
- I may not be an expert,

08:40.458 --> 08:44.041
but I was invited to play

08:40.458 --> 08:44.041
at the BHCCMGC yesterday.

08:44.083 --> 08:45.542
- The what?

08:45.583 --> 08:49.083
- The Big Hairy Cow

08:45.583 --> 08:49.083
Chocolate Milk Gulping Contest.

08:49.125 --> 08:51.250
Keep up, people.

08:51.291 --> 08:53.709
- No.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.166
I was invited to the

08:53.750 --> 08:56.166
Boulderly Hills Country Club,

08:56.208 --> 08:57.166
and you weren't.

08:57.208 --> 08:58.166
You know why?

08:58.208 --> 09:00.000
Because I take things seriously,

09:00.041 --> 09:02.542
and you

09:00.041 --> 09:02.542
nyach-nyach-nyach-nyach-nyach.

09:02.583 --> 09:06.000
- Oh, like you never

09:02.583 --> 09:06.000
nyach-nyach-nyach-nyach'd.

09:06.041 --> 09:08.959
- Yeah, I used to nyach-nyach

09:06.041 --> 09:08.959
and nom-nom,

09:09.000 --> 09:12.250
and even on occasion, I'd...

09:09.000 --> 09:12.250
[blows raspberry]

09:12.291 --> 09:14.250
But you know what?

09:12.291 --> 09:14.250
I grew up.

09:14.291 --> 09:15.583
And you should too.

09:15.625 --> 09:17.166
Now, if you'll excuse me,

09:17.208 --> 09:19.166
I'm going to go play a round

09:17.208 --> 09:19.166
of proper mini-golf

09:19.208 --> 09:22.166
at the most exclusive club

09:19.208 --> 09:22.166
in the city.

09:22.208 --> 09:23.041
Good day.

09:26.750 --> 09:28.500
I forgot my brochure.

09:28.542 --> 09:29.709
Good day!

09:35.417 --> 09:37.291
I promised Mom I'd walk him

09:35.417 --> 09:37.291
before I left.

09:37.333 --> 09:40.625
Final good day!

09:40.667 --> 09:43.500
- Wow, can you believe

09:40.667 --> 09:43.500
the nerve of that guy?

09:43.542 --> 09:45.041
He really thinks

09:43.542 --> 09:45.041
he's better than us.

09:45.083 --> 09:46.542
- Well, he's not.

09:45.083 --> 09:46.542
- Yeah.

09:46.583 --> 09:49.041
- Yeah. We'll show him.

09:49.083 --> 09:50.959
- Not now, though, right?

09:51.000 --> 09:53.917
- No, we're going to finish

09:51.000 --> 09:53.917
eating breakfast.

on hole number seven.

10:12.709 --> 10:15.291
I'm going to give it

10:12.709 --> 10:15.291
a little bacon grease.

10:15.333 --> 10:18.291
<i>- Please tell me "bacon grease"</i>

10:15.333 --> 10:18.291

10:18.333 --> 10:19.417

10:19.458 --> 10:22.333

10:22.375 --> 10:26.709
It fixes squeaks

10:22.375 --> 10:26.709

Mmm, liquid pig.

are you okay?

10:55.291 --> 10:56.750
- Yeah, I'm fine.

10:56.792 --> 10:59.166
There's just a lot

10:56.792 --> 10:59.166
of missing stuff up here.

10:59.208 --> 11:02.041
And I have a pretty good idea

10:59.208 --> 11:02.041
who's to blame.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.667
there are no "nom-noms"

how you scored a 39 today.

That's only one

the game is won

Yes, I did.

- Yeah, we're just

He's a Vestie now.

That's what we call ourselves.

13:07.208 --> 13:09.583
- Because we all wear vests.

- And we're besties.

So buh-bye.

you're classless garbage eaters

13:32.041 --> 13:34.041
