WEBVTT

01:32.735 --> 01:33.803
Fuck her.

01:33.836 --> 01:35.371
- Fuck her.
- Yeah. Fuck her.

01:35.405 --> 01:37.507
- Fuck her.
- This is how business is done, man.

01:37.540 --> 01:39.842
I mean, this is... well, it's
just a round of fucking golf.

01:39.876 --> 01:41.244
You'd think we were
taking clients out

01:41.277 --> 01:42.378
- to a strip club.
- Well... well...

01:42.412 --> 01:43.846
Which we can't even do anymore.

01:43.880 --> 01:46.182
Exactly.
We can't even do that anymore

01:46.215 --> 01:47.350
- since the Christmas party last year.
- Okay.

01:47.383 --> 01:48.818
I think it's because
the golf club

01:48.851 --> 01:49.886
doesn't let women play there.

01:49.919 --> 01:51.721
So?

01:51.754 --> 01:53.590
So it means we're having
client meetings without her.

01:53.623 --> 01:57.627
Look, she should just focus
on closing her own shit

01:57.660 --> 02:00.730
instead of whining about how
we're doing better than her.

02:00.763 --> 02:02.398
Jesus.

02:02.432 --> 02:04.467
Oh, hey,
would you look at that?

02:04.500 --> 02:06.402
- Good God Almighty.
- Yikes.

02:06.436 --> 02:08.471
Why don't you get
some dignity, sweetheart?

02:08.504 --> 02:11.206
You know, they put themselves
in danger, girls like that.

02:11.239 --> 02:12.609
If she's not careful,
someone's gonna take advantage.

02:12.642 --> 02:14.410
Especially the kind of guys
in this club.

02:16.779 --> 02:18.348
She's kind of hot.

02:18.381 --> 02:20.350
A hot fucking mess.

02:21.584 --> 02:22.919
Hey. Let's talk to Brian.

02:22.952 --> 02:24.487
I think he might be
amenable to the idea

02:24.520 --> 02:25.788
if we all present
a very nice...

02:25.822 --> 02:27.890
I mean, that is just
asking for it.

02:29.759 --> 02:30.994
Oh, look at that.

02:31.027 --> 02:33.796
You know, like, you'd think
you'd learn by that age, right?

02:33.830 --> 02:35.765
Where even are her friends?

02:35.798 --> 02:37.433
Just kind of ran off somewhere?

02:37.467 --> 02:40.503
Leaving her laying around
for anyone to pick up.

02:42.437 --> 02:44.941
Sounds like a challenge, Paul.

02:44.974 --> 02:46.776
Yeah? Maybe.

02:46.809 --> 02:49.579
- I'll go over.
- Oh!

02:49.612 --> 02:50.647
- Whoa!
- Jerry!

02:50.680 --> 02:51.614
My God, I didn't know

02:51.648 --> 02:53.549
- you had it in you.
- To see if she's okay.

02:53.583 --> 02:54.651
- Yeah, no. Of course.
- Yeah, sure.

02:54.684 --> 02:56.451
- Go for it, big fella.
- Uh-huh. Yeah. Why don't you

02:56.485 --> 02:58.253
- go see, make sure she's okay.
- We're pulling for you.

02:59.421 --> 03:02.859
- Oh, my God...
- Hey.

03:02.892 --> 03:04.226
You okay?

03:06.294 --> 03:08.665
What are you looking for?

03:08.698 --> 03:09.966
Phone.

03:09.999 --> 03:12.802
- Uh-huh.
- It's not here.

03:12.835 --> 03:15.570
It's got to be here.
I just had it.

03:15.604 --> 03:17.539
Uh...

03:17.572 --> 03:20.810
You think maybe you left it
in the bathroom or something?

03:20.843 --> 03:23.278
No.

03:28.985 --> 03:30.485
You gonna be okay?

03:32.454 --> 03:33.422
Oh, yeah.

03:33.455 --> 03:35.357
How you gonna get home?

03:38.995 --> 03:40.797
Ride... ride app.

03:40.830 --> 03:42.464
Yeah. Yeah.

03:42.497 --> 03:44.366
I think you might need
a phone for that.

03:44.399 --> 03:47.436
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

03:47.469 --> 03:48.837
I know.

03:48.871 --> 03:51.440
Oh, no.

03:52.474 --> 03:54.944
Okay, look, I'm, um...
I'm headed out anyway,

03:54.977 --> 03:56.845
so I can drop you off.

03:56.878 --> 03:57.914
- No.
- It's totally fine.

03:57.947 --> 03:58.948
It's not a problem.

03:58.981 --> 03:59.982
- Really.
- No.

04:00.016 --> 04:02.018
What are you gonna do?

04:02.051 --> 04:04.419
It's fine. Come on.
It's not a problem.

04:05.754 --> 04:07.456
Let's go.

04:07.489 --> 04:09.491
There you go.

04:09.524 --> 04:10.425
You got it?

04:10.459 --> 04:12.761
All right, just hold on
to the railing.

04:14.596 --> 04:16.364
- Yeah? You okay?
- Oh, my God.

04:25.874 --> 04:27.709
Come on.
I just had my car cleaned.

04:27.743 --> 04:29.044
She's fine.

04:29.077 --> 04:31.246
No, I'm not.

04:32.347 --> 04:33.815
I'm not gonna throw up.

04:33.849 --> 04:35.050
I don't think.

04:35.083 --> 04:36.485
No?

04:36.518 --> 04:38.019
There you have it, sir. See?

04:38.053 --> 04:39.721
She's not...
she's not gonna throw up.

04:39.755 --> 04:41.490
Whoo-hoo!

04:46.027 --> 04:47.429
Uh...

04:50.465 --> 04:52.501
My apartment is
a few blocks from here.

04:52.534 --> 04:56.905
Would you want to have a drink
before hitting the hay?

04:56.938 --> 04:58.507
Mm...

04:58.540 --> 04:59.641
It's literally right here.

04:59.674 --> 05:02.043
You want to have,
like, one beer?

05:02.077 --> 05:03.178
Yeah.

05:03.211 --> 05:06.381
Could you take us to 242
Raleigh Drive instead, please?

05:06.414 --> 05:08.784
It's a couple blocks.

05:08.817 --> 05:11.486
Just put the address
in the app.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.421
Put the address in the app.

05:15.123 --> 05:17.659
<i>Kumquat liqueur.</i>

05:17.692 --> 05:19.828
Here we go, milady.

05:23.131 --> 05:25.000
Hey, sorry about
my friends at the bar.

05:25.033 --> 05:27.803
They're... they're assholes.

05:27.836 --> 05:30.105
Oh, it's okay.

05:30.138 --> 05:32.107
There you go.

05:32.140 --> 05:34.441
You got it.

05:35.143 --> 05:36.812
Do you live alone here?

05:36.845 --> 05:40.949
No, but, uh, my roommate's
out of town, so don't worry.

05:40.982 --> 05:43.350
- Right.
- Yeah.

05:48.790 --> 05:51.092
- Ah.
- Ugh, that's disgusting.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.135
You're so beautiful.

06:00.168 --> 06:02.070
You know what?
Do you mind if I just...

06:02.103 --> 06:05.472
- Mm.
- You've got a little smudge.

06:07.474 --> 06:08.910
There, right there.

06:29.064 --> 06:30.932
Wow.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.604
- I need to lie down.
- Oh.

06:36.637 --> 06:38.606
Yeah, of course.

06:39.506 --> 06:40.808
Right this way.

06:44.445 --> 06:46.680
- Don't go to sleep.
- What?

06:47.648 --> 06:50.018
Gosh, you're so pretty.

06:50.051 --> 06:52.620
Wait.

06:54.055 --> 06:55.956
- What are you...
- It's okay.

06:55.991 --> 06:57.491
Hey, you're safe.

06:58.159 --> 06:59.493
What are you...?

06:59.526 --> 07:00.895
Hey, it's okay.

07:00.928 --> 07:03.998
- You're safe. Shh.
- What are you doing?

07:04.032 --> 07:07.001
Mm. My God, your body.

07:07.035 --> 07:08.969
What are you doing?

07:09.003 --> 07:10.804
Hmm?

07:14.041 --> 07:15.943
What are you doing?

07:15.976 --> 07:17.811
Wait.

07:19.847 --> 07:20.981
What are you...?

07:34.695 --> 07:36.697
Hey.

07:38.632 --> 07:39.267
Hey.

07:39.301 --> 07:42.569
I said, what are you doing?

08:41.161 --> 08:43.529
Oh, walk of shame!

08:45.165 --> 08:46.767
Good time last night,
sweetheart?

08:46.800 --> 08:48.235
There it goes straight up!

08:48.268 --> 08:49.535
There you go!

08:49.569 --> 08:51.672
- Uh-huh.
- Get yourself some Plan B!

08:51.705 --> 08:53.207
Uh-oh!

08:53.240 --> 08:55.242
- How much, baby? How much?
- Fuck that!

08:55.275 --> 08:57.311
- What's wrong, baby?
- What's up?

08:57.344 --> 08:59.013
Can't take a joke?
Jesus, lady, what's up?

08:59.046 --> 09:02.582
Come on, why don't you give us
a little smile, huh?

09:06.086 --> 09:08.055
- Stop staring.
- What the fuck you staring at?

09:08.088 --> 09:10.757
Stop it.
You can't take a joke?

09:10.791 --> 09:12.558
Okay. Fuck you, then.

09:44.824 --> 09:47.194
Didn't hear you
come in last night.

09:47.227 --> 09:49.196
Everything all right?

09:51.131 --> 09:53.666
I had to work late.

09:53.699 --> 09:54.967
Hmm.

09:56.403 --> 09:59.772
I thought the coffee house
closed at 9:00.

10:02.842 --> 10:04.977
We had to do inventory.

10:06.246 --> 10:09.615
You have to do a lot
of inventory at that place.

10:09.649 --> 10:11.984
You should speak to the manager.

10:12.018 --> 10:13.986
I will.

10:15.721 --> 10:17.690
<i>You know, I was talking</i>

10:17.723 --> 10:21.094
to Graham earlier,
and he says there's a position

10:21.127 --> 10:22.962
opening up at head office.

10:22.995 --> 10:23.996
And don't freak out,

10:24.030 --> 10:26.699
but I want you to know
I recommended you for it.

10:26.732 --> 10:28.335
- Hi. Can...
- Why would you do that?

10:28.368 --> 10:30.370
'Cause you're stinking up
the joint

10:30.404 --> 10:31.737
with your sad little face.

10:31.771 --> 10:33.172
But I like it here.

10:33.206 --> 10:34.707
No, you don't.

10:34.740 --> 10:37.710
No, I don't, but I like you.

10:37.743 --> 10:39.178
And I like...

10:39.212 --> 10:41.381
Hello?

10:41.415 --> 10:42.982
...working in
a customer-facing role.

10:43.015 --> 10:45.251
- Great. Can I get some...
- No.

10:45.284 --> 10:48.221
- Cassie.
- Don't "Cassie" me.

10:48.254 --> 10:49.856
I'm fine. Gail, really.

10:52.859 --> 10:55.828
Johnny said he saw you
at The Fallout last week.

10:55.862 --> 10:57.997
Said you were completely
hammered and on your own.

10:58.030 --> 11:00.833
He was a little worried. I know
it's none of my business...

11:00.867 --> 11:03.769
He must have seen someone else.
I've never been there.

11:06.272 --> 11:08.274
Okay.

11:11.978 --> 11:13.679
<i>I like your pigtails.</i>

11:13.713 --> 11:15.047
<i>Thank you.</i>

11:15.081 --> 11:16.716
<i>Hey, you want another drink?</i>

11:16.749 --> 11:18.885
<i>Um, I don't think...</i>

11:18.918 --> 11:20.786
<i>Hey, let me get you one.
Vodka cranberry</i>

11:20.820 --> 11:23.389
<i>for the lady, please.</i>

11:23.422 --> 11:25.024
<i>Hey. How old are you?</i>

11:25.057 --> 11:27.426
- <i>Um...</i>
- <i>Old enough, right?</i>

11:59.125 --> 12:01.093
Can I get a coffee, please?

12:02.995 --> 12:04.796
Mm-hmm.

12:12.205 --> 12:14.173
You want milk?

12:20.446 --> 12:22.215
What?

12:22.248 --> 12:24.483
Cassandra?

12:24.517 --> 12:26.986
- Yeah.
- Ryan.

12:27.019 --> 12:30.223
Cooper. We were in class
together at Forrest Med School.

12:30.256 --> 12:32.491
Second-year neurology,
Dr. Hadid's class.

12:32.525 --> 12:34.960
Oh. Yeah.

12:34.994 --> 12:36.362
Ryan. Hi.

12:36.395 --> 12:39.265
God. Why are you working here?

12:39.298 --> 12:40.832
Or...

12:41.500 --> 12:42.968
I didn't mean...

12:43.001 --> 12:44.237
That was rude. I didn't...

12:44.270 --> 12:47.240
You didn't mean,
what am I doing working

12:47.273 --> 12:49.007
in a shitty coffee shop?

12:49.040 --> 12:52.345
Yeah. No. I just meant,
you know, given...

12:53.979 --> 12:55.847
- There's no getting out of this, is there?
- Nuh-uh.

12:55.880 --> 12:57.816
I'm gonna leave.
Can I leave and then come back?

12:57.849 --> 12:59.818
And I can do it...
I can do it again

12:59.851 --> 13:02.421
- and be better next time.
- You want milk?

13:02.455 --> 13:03.888
Pardon?

13:04.557 --> 13:05.924
In your coffee.

13:05.957 --> 13:06.858
No.

13:06.891 --> 13:09.528
But, uh, you can spit in it
if you want.

13:09.562 --> 13:10.862
I-I deserve that.

13:20.038 --> 13:21.973
Thank you.

13:25.311 --> 13:27.313
Do you want to go out with me?

13:27.346 --> 13:28.880
What?

13:28.913 --> 13:32.017
On a... date.

13:33.318 --> 13:36.455
Seriously?
I just spat in your coffee.

13:49.568 --> 13:51.436
And then I like
to finish always

13:51.470 --> 13:53.038
with a little dab of gloss

13:53.071 --> 13:56.441
just to give it
a kind of wet texture.

13:56.474 --> 13:58.943
Just dab in the middle...

13:58.977 --> 14:01.212
and on the top.

14:04.650 --> 14:06.384
And there you go.

14:06.418 --> 14:09.220
Perfect blow job lips.

14:09.254 --> 14:10.889
So,

14:10.922 --> 14:12.957
don't forget to like
and subscribe.

14:12.991 --> 14:14.593
Thank you, guys, for following.

14:14.627 --> 14:16.928
I love you. Bye.

14:23.168 --> 14:24.402
Seriously, you got to read it.

14:24.436 --> 14:27.972
<i>Consider the Lobster</i> is
one of the fucking greats, man.

14:28.006 --> 14:30.442
Cracked my head open
like a, uh...

14:30.475 --> 14:32.344
like a lobster claw.

14:38.516 --> 14:40.218
You know, I'm actually
writing a novel.

14:40.251 --> 14:41.252
Well, kind of,

14:41.286 --> 14:43.621
'cause I'm such a fucking
perfectionist, you know?

14:43.655 --> 14:45.256
It's just taking me forever.

14:45.290 --> 14:47.926
I just keep going over it
and over it and over it

14:47.959 --> 14:50.495
in my head,
just picking at it like a scab.

14:50.528 --> 14:52.330
It's about, uh, I guess, like,

14:52.364 --> 14:54.666
what it's like to be a guy
right now, you know?

14:54.699 --> 14:57.102
Like, what it's like to be
a guy in the world.

14:57.135 --> 15:00.205
Just this gritty,
low-life, fucked-up love story.

15:00.238 --> 15:02.173
And it all takes place
in New York

15:02.207 --> 15:04.442
over the course of one night.

15:05.477 --> 15:06.644
You know what?

15:06.678 --> 15:08.580
I'm gonna stop talking about it.

15:08.613 --> 15:10.582
I don't want to jinx it.

15:10.615 --> 15:12.150
You do coke, right?

15:12.183 --> 15:14.652
- Mm, not really.
- Oh, come on.

15:14.686 --> 15:17.622
I got work in the morning.

15:17.655 --> 15:19.657
Oh, whatever. So do I.

15:21.259 --> 15:23.395
Here.

15:23.428 --> 15:25.096
Get right.

15:26.097 --> 15:26.765
No.

15:26.798 --> 15:29.900
Just put your nose up to this.

15:31.001 --> 15:32.470
No, here. Maybe just...

15:34.037 --> 15:36.307
Okay, that didn't work.

15:40.077 --> 15:43.415
Hey. Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

15:43.448 --> 15:45.383
There you go.

15:51.088 --> 15:55.427
Oh, my God,
you are so, so pretty.

15:55.460 --> 15:57.695
But why are you wearing
all that makeup?

15:57.729 --> 15:59.264
Do you mind me asking?

15:59.297 --> 16:01.633
I never understood why women
wear so much makeup.

16:01.666 --> 16:04.269
It's like, you guys are so much
more beautiful without it.

16:04.302 --> 16:07.037
It's like, guys don't even like
that kind of stuff, you know?

16:07.070 --> 16:09.039
It's just this
soul-sucking system

16:09.072 --> 16:11.543
meant to oppress women,
and it's fucked up.

16:17.415 --> 16:18.383
I want to see you.

16:18.416 --> 16:21.051
The real you.

16:21.084 --> 16:25.222
With all your freckles
and your imperfections.

16:29.661 --> 16:32.597
I don't feel good.

16:32.630 --> 16:34.666
Could you get me
a glass of water?

16:34.699 --> 16:37.100
Yeah. Sure.

16:49.313 --> 16:51.381
Are you fucking kidding me?

16:52.382 --> 16:54.619
Hey.

16:54.652 --> 16:56.386
Hey, you.

16:58.790 --> 17:00.023
Hey!

17:00.057 --> 17:01.492
Hey.

17:01.525 --> 17:02.727
There you are.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.261
You fell asleep.

17:10.133 --> 17:13.337
Good girl.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.607
Feel better?

17:16.640 --> 17:19.109
No.

17:19.142 --> 17:20.644
You know, I, um...

17:20.677 --> 17:23.113
I nearly didn't
come out tonight.

17:23.146 --> 17:24.782
And I am so glad that I did.

17:24.816 --> 17:27.084
I feel such a connection
to you.

17:27.785 --> 17:29.119
Could you call me a cab?

17:29.152 --> 17:31.321
You just got here.

17:31.355 --> 17:33.524
- No, I need to go home.
- No.

17:33.557 --> 17:35.459
Don't go.

17:35.492 --> 17:37.261
Stay.

17:37.294 --> 17:39.396
My God, you are so...

17:39.429 --> 17:41.064
I need to go.

17:41.098 --> 17:43.100
No, you don't want to go home.

17:43.133 --> 17:45.369
I need to go home.

17:59.449 --> 18:01.485
- Hey, Neil.
- Yeah?

18:02.886 --> 18:06.156
I said I need to go home.

18:06.189 --> 18:08.158
Holy shit. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:08.191 --> 18:09.326
What is this?

18:09.359 --> 18:10.861
Are you some kind
of psycho or something?

18:10.894 --> 18:12.329
Why do you say that?

18:12.362 --> 18:14.164
- I just thought that you were...
- Drunk?

18:14.197 --> 18:15.599
- Yeah.
- Really drunk?

18:15.632 --> 18:16.700
Fuck.

18:16.733 --> 18:17.801
Yeah.

18:17.834 --> 18:19.236
Well, I'm not.

18:19.269 --> 18:21.138
But that's good, isn't it?

18:21.171 --> 18:23.340
- I think you should leave.
- Oh.

18:23.373 --> 18:25.576
- Now you want me to leave?
- No.

18:25.609 --> 18:28.312
I just... I'm really high.

18:28.345 --> 18:30.314
Like, I'm really fucking high
right now.

18:30.347 --> 18:31.848
I don't know what I'm doing.

18:31.882 --> 18:34.284
I think you should go.

18:34.318 --> 18:37.254
But a second ago, you were
determined for me to stay.

18:37.287 --> 18:39.289
You were pretty insistent,
actually.

18:40.190 --> 18:41.491
I'm a nice guy.

18:42.559 --> 18:43.393
Are you?

18:43.427 --> 18:45.829
I thought we had
a connection, I guess.

18:45.862 --> 18:47.331
A connection?

18:47.364 --> 18:49.165
Okay.

18:50.232 --> 18:52.101
What do I do for a living?

18:53.235 --> 18:54.771
Sorry.
Maybe that one's too hard.

18:54.805 --> 18:56.540
How old am I?

18:57.774 --> 19:00.510
How long have I lived
in the city?

19:01.945 --> 19:04.213
What are my hobbies?

19:06.917 --> 19:08.685
What's my name?

19:11.521 --> 19:12.389
All right.

19:12.422 --> 19:15.291
All right, fuck,
I get your fucking point.

19:15.324 --> 19:16.827
What do you want from me?

19:16.860 --> 19:18.695
To say that I'm an asshole?

19:18.729 --> 19:20.631
Fine, I'm a fucking asshole.

19:20.664 --> 19:22.866
Whoa.

19:22.899 --> 19:24.901
Why are you so freaked out,
Neil?

19:24.935 --> 19:26.369
You really need to calm down.

19:26.402 --> 19:28.572
At least you didn't try
to have sex with me

19:28.605 --> 19:29.806
while I was passed out.

19:29.840 --> 19:31.340
You do get points for that.

19:31.374 --> 19:33.810
A few guys, meh...
eh, they don't mind so much.

19:33.844 --> 19:38.514
But you woke me up before
putting your fingers inside me.

19:38.548 --> 19:40.651
- That was sweet.
- What are you trying to say?

19:40.684 --> 19:43.252
That I'm, like,
a predator or something?

19:43.285 --> 19:45.521
I don't know. Are you?

19:45.554 --> 19:47.556
I am a nice guy.

19:47.591 --> 19:49.191
You keep saying that.

19:49.225 --> 19:50.861
You're not as rare as you think.

19:50.894 --> 19:52.763
You know how I know?

19:52.796 --> 19:54.330
No.

19:54.363 --> 19:57.734
Because every week,
I go to a club,

19:57.768 --> 20:02.873
and every week, I act like
I'm too drunk to stand.

20:02.906 --> 20:05.976
And every...

20:06.009 --> 20:10.279
...fucking week,
a nice guy like you

20:10.312 --> 20:13.416
comes over to see if I'm okay.

20:16.787 --> 20:19.555
You want to fuck me still?

20:19.588 --> 20:21.724
No, thank you, ma'am.

20:21.757 --> 20:23.827
Hmm.

20:23.860 --> 20:25.728
No one ever does.

20:26.997 --> 20:29.699
Careful next time
you go out, Neil.

20:29.732 --> 20:32.601
Your novel sounds terrible,
by the way.

20:48.651 --> 20:50.786
Night, Nina.

21:00.296 --> 21:02.531
What's this?

21:05.901 --> 21:08.270
Mom, what's this?

21:08.971 --> 21:10.706
What do you mean?

21:10.740 --> 21:13.576
This gift.

21:15.511 --> 21:17.546
It's your birthday, Cassie.

21:20.516 --> 21:21.784
Oh.

21:23.018 --> 21:25.354
Yeah.

21:25.387 --> 21:28.424
What kind of...

21:28.457 --> 21:30.459
kind of person
forgets their 30th birthday?

21:30.493 --> 21:33.028
Oh, sweetheart, come on.
Don't...

21:33.062 --> 21:35.598
Don't, Stanley.
You know, please, don't.

21:35.631 --> 21:37.500
It was just a mistake, Mom.

21:37.533 --> 21:39.068
You know I'm terrible
with dates.

21:39.101 --> 21:40.836
It's not a big deal.

21:40.870 --> 21:42.471
Not a big deal?

21:43.405 --> 21:44.573
Not a big deal?

21:44.607 --> 21:48.377
You-you just forgot
your birthday.

21:48.410 --> 21:50.346
You don't want to have a party?

21:50.379 --> 21:52.348
You don't want to see
your friends?

21:52.381 --> 21:54.083
You know I don't have
any friends, Mom.

21:54.116 --> 21:56.919
Don't joke about it. Don't.

21:56.952 --> 22:00.556
Do you know how strange this is?

22:01.957 --> 22:04.660
You, you're still living
here at home.

22:04.693 --> 22:06.796
Working in that
stupid coffee shop

22:06.829 --> 22:09.598
since you and Nina
dropped out of med school.

22:09.632 --> 22:12.101
You're out all night long
doing God only knows what.

22:12.134 --> 22:13.803
- Okay.
- And you...

22:13.836 --> 22:15.905
You don't have any boyfriend.
You don't have any friends.

22:15.938 --> 22:18.941
Mom, you should have saved
all that for my birthday card.

22:18.974 --> 22:21.710
Why don't we just let the kid
celebrate however she wants?

22:21.744 --> 22:24.479
- Okay?
- All my friends, they ask about you.

22:24.512 --> 22:27.616
I-I-I don't know
what to tell them.

22:27.650 --> 22:29.985
I-I don't know
what happened here.

22:30.019 --> 22:32.822
I don't...

22:34.990 --> 22:37.760
Why don't you just open
your present there, Cass?

22:37.793 --> 22:39.094
Okay?

22:39.128 --> 22:40.896
Go ahead.

22:40.930 --> 22:42.932
Yeah.

22:53.441 --> 22:56.278
Oh, I hope you like it.

23:00.149 --> 23:02.517
Thank you.

23:05.520 --> 23:07.488
<i>Whoa.</i>

23:07.522 --> 23:09.158
- Yeah.
- That's direct.

23:09.191 --> 23:11.659
A real kick in the cunt.

23:11.693 --> 23:14.029
- Is it a nice suitcase, at least?
- Oh, yeah.

23:14.063 --> 23:15.331
It's definitely the fanciest

23:15.363 --> 23:18.133
"get the fuck out of our house"
metaphor I've received so far.

23:18.167 --> 23:19.068
So, why don't you?

23:19.101 --> 23:21.003
- What?
- Get the fuck out of their house.

23:21.036 --> 23:24.472
Just, I don't know, go on Zillow or...

23:24.505 --> 23:26.608
<i>Single White Female</i> some girl.

23:26.641 --> 23:28.877
Get a basement room at some
weird guy's house, anything.

23:28.911 --> 23:30.812
I can't afford it, Gail.

23:30.845 --> 23:32.413
Not on what you pay me.

23:32.447 --> 23:34.149
Not even a weird guy's basement.

23:34.183 --> 23:36.185
So take this other job, then.

23:36.218 --> 23:37.186
Take any job.

23:37.219 --> 23:39.454
Are you firing me?

23:39.487 --> 23:41.456
Maybe I should.

23:41.489 --> 23:43.791
Look, you're making
the assumption

23:43.825 --> 23:45.493
that I want any of it.

23:45.526 --> 23:46.661
If I wanted a boyfriend

23:46.694 --> 23:48.596
and a yoga class
and a house and kids

23:48.630 --> 23:50.899
and a job my mom could
brag about, I'd have done it.

23:50.932 --> 23:54.035
It would take me ten minutes.
I don't want it.

23:54.069 --> 23:55.837
I don't want it.

23:56.704 --> 23:58.473
But you must want something.

23:58.506 --> 24:00.708
Hey.

24:00.742 --> 24:03.145
Oh. You.

24:03.178 --> 24:05.914
- Hi.
- One coffee, hold the spit.

24:06.948 --> 24:09.484
She spat in my coffee last time.

24:10.151 --> 24:12.553
I'm back because, um,

24:12.587 --> 24:16.090
I think you gave me a...
a fake number the other day.

24:16.124 --> 24:18.059
Mm, that doesn't sound like me.

24:18.092 --> 24:19.193
I know.

24:19.228 --> 24:21.230
So I spent a few hours composing

24:21.263 --> 24:23.798
a, like, very witty,
very romantic text,

24:23.831 --> 24:28.069
and then I sent that text to
an oil rig worker called Red.

24:28.102 --> 24:30.204
- Was he into it?
- Surprisingly into it.

24:30.238 --> 24:33.541
It was, like,
immediately inappropriate.

24:33.574 --> 24:36.077
But it's not gonna work out
'cause of the oil rig,

24:36.110 --> 24:40.081
so I thought I'd try you again.

24:40.114 --> 24:42.216
I just heard a phone ring
in the back.

24:42.250 --> 24:44.619
- No, you didn't.
- I most definitely heard

24:44.652 --> 24:46.521
a phone ring in the back.

24:46.554 --> 24:49.958
She has to take a few
imaginary calls a day.

24:51.960 --> 24:55.697
Um, look, if you're not
into this, totally get it.

24:55.730 --> 24:58.733
I'm not really looking to date
anyone at the moment.

24:58.766 --> 25:00.735
Right. Yeah.

25:00.768 --> 25:01.936
Me, neither.

25:01.970 --> 25:05.840
Would you... be interested
in a friendship

25:05.873 --> 25:10.111
and I'm secretly pining for you
the whole time?

25:11.579 --> 25:13.247
Dating's horrible.
Everyone's horrible.

25:13.281 --> 25:15.583
Okay, I went on a date
last month with a woman

25:15.616 --> 25:16.851
who wanted to euthanize
the homeless.

25:16.884 --> 25:18.586
You went on a date with my mom?

25:18.619 --> 25:19.721
Look,

25:19.754 --> 25:22.256
I always liked you
at med school.

25:22.290 --> 25:23.624
Okay?

25:23.658 --> 25:25.727
I genuinely like you,

25:25.760 --> 25:28.162
and I can't stop thinking about
you spitting in my coffee.

25:28.196 --> 25:31.032
So go to lunch with me
this weekend.

25:31.065 --> 25:33.901
Please. If you don't like it,
we can have a safe word

25:33.935 --> 25:37.005
and you can leave,
no questions asked.

25:37.038 --> 25:38.773
<i>Not that you mind the killings.</i>

25:38.806 --> 25:40.607
Your book is full of killings.

25:42.043 --> 25:44.746
But there are things
you do hate, Lord.

25:44.779 --> 25:47.015
Perfume-smelling things.

25:47.048 --> 25:48.682
Lacy things.

25:48.715 --> 25:50.151
Things with curly hair.

25:52.787 --> 25:54.554
Hey.

25:54.588 --> 25:55.890
You're all dressed up.

25:55.923 --> 25:57.624
Where you going?

25:57.657 --> 25:59.760
I'm going out for lunch.

25:59.793 --> 26:01.896
With who?

26:01.929 --> 26:03.630
A friend.

26:03.663 --> 26:05.799
Cassie.

26:07.368 --> 26:09.803
You look very pretty, honey.

26:11.372 --> 26:13.107
Thank you, Dad.

26:14.242 --> 26:16.710
<i>Where... where did she get</i>

26:16.743 --> 26:17.979
- a skeleton's hand from?
- She got it...

26:18.012 --> 26:19.813
It was her, uh...
it was her grandfather's.

26:19.846 --> 26:21.848
No. It was... She got it
from the staff room,

26:21.882 --> 26:25.186
but the worst part is
she looked me in the eye,

26:25.219 --> 26:28.256
pulled it out
and then waved it at me.

26:29.890 --> 26:31.625
And I am done.

26:31.658 --> 26:33.794
And I'm wondering why
I told that story.

26:33.827 --> 26:36.797
Hey. There is nothing more
romantic than a disturbed woman

26:36.830 --> 26:39.599
pulling a skeleton's hand
out of her vagina.

26:39.633 --> 26:40.801
That's true.
That's very true.

26:40.834 --> 26:43.670
No one ever pulls anything
out of anywhere where I work.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.072
Right, so you didn't want to...

26:45.106 --> 26:47.175
- What?
- Carry on with med school or...

26:47.208 --> 26:48.608
No.

26:48.642 --> 26:50.211
Really? Why not?

26:50.244 --> 26:52.746
I wanted to do something else.

26:52.779 --> 26:53.980
Why?

26:54.014 --> 26:54.981
I don't know.

26:55.015 --> 26:57.318
You were so good, though.
You knew everything.

26:57.351 --> 26:59.320
- You...
- I didn't know everything.

26:59.353 --> 27:01.688
You did.
You were incredible.

27:01.721 --> 27:04.091
I was... I was awful. I...

27:04.124 --> 27:06.860
Remember I removed the
wrong kidney from my cadaver?

27:06.893 --> 27:09.162
And look at you now...
operating on children.

27:09.196 --> 27:10.864
Yes. I got better.

27:10.897 --> 27:14.368
Thank God. But you, you were
way ahead of everybody.

27:14.402 --> 27:17.003
You-you would have been
a great doctor.

27:18.406 --> 27:21.375
Just didn't want it enough,
I guess.

27:24.277 --> 27:25.979
Um...

27:26.012 --> 27:27.747
You want to get coffee
or something?

27:27.781 --> 27:29.983
We, um... we have some time
before the movie.

27:30.016 --> 27:32.352
I can tell you about the guy
who got his dick

27:32.386 --> 27:33.720
trapped in a tambourine.

27:33.753 --> 27:35.322
Oh, my God.

27:37.357 --> 27:40.694
Do you think people think
you're my daughter from behind?

27:40.727 --> 27:41.995
'Cause of the height.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.763
- The height, I'm saying.
- No.

27:43.797 --> 27:45.799
It's like a fear
I have in public,

27:45.832 --> 27:47.400
if I'm with a woman.

27:47.434 --> 27:49.836
My fear is that, like,
if I kiss her,

27:49.870 --> 27:52.873
like, people will be like,
"Stop kissing that child."

27:52.906 --> 27:55.742
- I shouldn't yell this part, but...
- No.

27:55.775 --> 27:58.678
I mean, try not being
so tall, maybe.

27:58.712 --> 28:00.680
- Don't be tall.
- Maybe, yeah.

28:00.714 --> 28:02.249
- Yeah.
- It's kind of flashy.

28:03.850 --> 28:07.154
Whoa. This is...
this is a weird coincidence.

28:07.187 --> 28:08.388
What?

28:08.421 --> 28:10.123
I think...

28:10.157 --> 28:11.224
No.

28:11.258 --> 28:12.759
Yeah, this is my apartment.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.897
What a weird, weird coincidence.

28:16.930 --> 28:19.032
Yeah. Do you want to...

28:19.065 --> 28:20.433
I mean, we're here.

28:20.467 --> 28:23.170
Do you want to go up,
have a drink or...

28:23.203 --> 28:25.305
Sure. Why not?

28:25.338 --> 28:27.741
Too soon. Sorry. I wasn't...

28:27.774 --> 28:29.075
No, let's go upstairs.

28:29.109 --> 28:32.045
I don't want to go up
if you don't want to...

28:32.078 --> 28:33.780
I-I misread things.
I'll-I'll drive you home.

28:33.813 --> 28:35.248
You know what?
You're at your place.

28:35.282 --> 28:36.316
I can call a cab.

28:36.349 --> 28:37.750
- Are you sure?
- Sure.

28:37.784 --> 28:39.452
Okay, I feel like
I fucked this up.

28:39.486 --> 28:41.955
No, it's not you.

29:13.987 --> 29:15.522
Pediatric
assistant to admitting.

29:17.157 --> 29:19.025
Need a pediatric assistant
to admitting, please.

29:19.059 --> 29:22.229
- I'll let you know.
- Okay. Thank you.

29:23.263 --> 29:25.098
Cassie, what...

29:25.131 --> 29:27.267
What are you...
what are you doing here?

29:29.001 --> 29:30.970
Um...

29:31.003 --> 29:35.242
I just came to pick up
my herpes medication.

29:35.275 --> 29:36.809
You have herpes, too.

29:36.842 --> 29:39.145
That saves us
an awkward conversation.

29:40.580 --> 29:43.550
Dr. Dinkins, please dial 3751.

29:43.583 --> 29:47.119
Dr. Dinkins, 3751.

29:47.152 --> 29:48.921
So, I...

29:49.989 --> 29:52.124
So, I'd like to see you again.

29:52.157 --> 29:53.926
Oh.

29:53.959 --> 29:56.061
- If that's cool.
- Yeah.

29:56.095 --> 29:58.498
But we'd need to take it slow.
I understand...

29:58.531 --> 30:01.867
Of course. Totally. I...

30:01.900 --> 30:03.403
I can take it slow.

30:03.436 --> 30:06.872
I can barely move,
if you'd like.

30:08.274 --> 30:09.409
Thank you.

30:09.442 --> 30:10.809
Yeah. Sorry.

30:10.843 --> 30:11.944
I could write a poem.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.178
This is awesome.

30:13.212 --> 30:16.148
Uh, what are you doing? You want
to get dinner or something?

30:16.181 --> 30:17.550
Are you working?

30:17.584 --> 30:19.018
Well, no. Um...

30:19.051 --> 30:21.854
He has leukemia, and, uh,

30:21.887 --> 30:23.989
there's really nothing
I can do for him.

30:24.023 --> 30:27.993
- Oh, my God.
- It's-it's over.

30:28.027 --> 30:29.562
- I'm kidding. My shift's over.
- Oh, my God.

30:29.596 --> 30:31.330
- I'll grab my stuff, okay?
- Okay.

30:31.363 --> 30:32.431
Okay.

30:32.465 --> 30:34.900
Don't leave.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.811
- Oh, my God.
- What?

30:47.446 --> 30:49.882
Are you seeing that guy?

30:51.016 --> 30:52.951
No.

30:56.121 --> 30:57.856
Aw.

30:57.890 --> 30:59.892
Good for you.

31:04.930 --> 31:06.632
<i>So, Ryan...</i>

31:06.666 --> 31:08.300
pediatric surgeon, huh?

31:08.334 --> 31:10.235
Yes. Yes.

31:11.904 --> 31:13.339
You ever killed any children?

31:13.372 --> 31:14.940
Uh, what?

31:14.973 --> 31:16.075
While operating on them.

31:16.108 --> 31:17.943
Have you ever killed
any children?

31:17.976 --> 31:19.478
Uh, no. No.

31:19.511 --> 31:20.546
Really?

31:20.579 --> 31:21.613
- Gail.
- I...

31:21.647 --> 31:25.551
Well, kids have passed
while I've been operating.

31:25.584 --> 31:27.252
So that's a yes. Yes...

31:27.286 --> 31:30.489
Gail, stop asking him
if he's killed children.

31:30.522 --> 31:33.992
I will stop asking him
when he stops killing children.

31:34.026 --> 31:37.229
That-that seems fair.

31:37.262 --> 31:39.465
That seems fair.

31:39.498 --> 31:41.433
I'll leave you two
lovebirds to it.

31:41.467 --> 31:44.937
- Can you lock up for me, honey?
- Of course.

31:46.138 --> 31:50.976
Now, if you two decide
to have sex on the counter,

31:51.009 --> 31:53.878
the bleach is in the back room.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.216
And I don't want to walk
in here tomorrow morning

31:57.249 --> 31:59.218
and see ass prints
in the coffee grinds.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.519
Got it?

32:00.552 --> 32:02.121
Got it, lover boy?

32:02.154 --> 32:04.056
Yeah.

32:04.089 --> 32:05.923
Have fun, you two.
Oh, my God.

32:13.998 --> 32:15.567
She seems nice.

32:17.034 --> 32:19.271
She is. She's a good friend.

32:19.304 --> 32:22.541
Are you... are you friends with
anyone from Forrest still or...

32:22.574 --> 32:24.008
No.

32:24.041 --> 32:26.311
Really? No one? No one?

32:26.345 --> 32:27.945
Really, no one.

32:27.979 --> 32:29.281
Oh, my God, I can't...
I can't...

32:29.314 --> 32:31.350
I can't shake them off.

32:32.584 --> 32:35.287
You still hang out
with those guys?

32:35.320 --> 32:37.389
They're not that bad.
They aren't, really.

32:37.423 --> 32:38.956
Um, oh, my God.

32:38.990 --> 32:42.126
Madison McPhee just had twins.

32:42.160 --> 32:45.163
She's completely obsessed.

32:45.196 --> 32:47.299
I don't remember Madison.

32:47.332 --> 32:50.669
You...
I thought you were close.

32:50.702 --> 32:53.705
You guys and that other girl.

32:53.739 --> 32:55.407
No.

32:55.441 --> 32:57.074
Huh.

32:57.108 --> 32:59.210
Um, oh, my God.

32:59.243 --> 33:02.581
Al Monroe is marrying
this bikini model.

33:02.614 --> 33:05.751
He got this hideous tattoo
of her name to propose.

33:05.784 --> 33:08.319
Amazingly, she said yes.

33:08.352 --> 33:10.456
Classic Al, you know?

33:10.489 --> 33:12.323
Landing on his feet.

33:12.356 --> 33:14.058
Al Monroe?

33:14.091 --> 33:17.061
You... well,
you must remember Al.

33:17.094 --> 33:18.996
Yeah, I thought
he moved to London.

33:19.030 --> 33:20.364
Yeah, he was there for years,

33:20.398 --> 33:23.535
but he just moved back
to get married.

33:23.569 --> 33:25.269
You see him a lot?

33:25.303 --> 33:28.740
Uh, we're not close,
but he's in the group.

33:28.774 --> 33:30.609
We actually
see each other at work,

33:30.642 --> 33:33.478
'cause he's a...
anesthesiologist.

33:33.511 --> 33:35.413
Good for him.

33:35.446 --> 33:37.081
And he's getting married?

33:37.114 --> 33:40.151
I know. God help her.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.791
Welcome to
the Hotel Saint Joan, miss.

35:26.824 --> 35:28.292
Thank you.

35:28.326 --> 35:31.862
One ginger ale
and one bottle of champagne.

35:31.896 --> 35:34.498
- Don't worry. I can do that.
- Oh, but it's...

35:56.252 --> 35:58.388
Cassie.

35:59.957 --> 36:01.257
Madison.

36:01.291 --> 36:03.461
Oh, my God.

36:06.262 --> 36:07.765
Oh, you look amazing.

36:07.798 --> 36:09.734
I almost didn't recognize you.

36:10.868 --> 36:12.770
You look exactly the same.

36:12.803 --> 36:14.805
- You're sweet. I look so old.
- No.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.607
That's what having twins
will do to you.

36:16.641 --> 36:17.675
It's tragic.

36:17.708 --> 36:18.776
Do you have kids?

36:18.809 --> 36:20.310
No.

36:20.343 --> 36:22.278
You'll get there.

36:22.312 --> 36:26.216
Champagne?
What are we drinking to?

36:26.249 --> 36:28.551
To old friends.

36:35.291 --> 36:37.160
Mm.

36:38.361 --> 36:39.930
Mm.

36:39.964 --> 36:41.799
Ah.

36:41.832 --> 36:45.635
Honestly, I thought I'd be
bored out of my skull

36:45.669 --> 36:48.706
watching the kids,
but it's been great, actually.

36:48.739 --> 36:51.809
Are we out already?
Can we get another bottle?

36:51.842 --> 36:53.309
Thanks.

36:53.343 --> 36:55.813
I haven't been day drunk
in forever.

36:55.846 --> 36:57.848
- So fun.
- So fun.

37:01.317 --> 37:05.555
TBH, I know all guys say
they want wives that work,

37:05.588 --> 37:07.858
but it's not true.

37:07.892 --> 37:09.459
- No?
- No.

37:09.492 --> 37:12.295
I mean, they all want
a feminist in college,

37:12.328 --> 37:13.630
because it's cool
to have a girlfriend

37:13.663 --> 37:14.999
who cares about something.

37:15.032 --> 37:16.466
And, statistically,

37:16.499 --> 37:18.435
feminists are more likely
to do anal.

37:18.468 --> 37:19.970
That's a literal fact,
by the way.

37:20.004 --> 37:21.304
Really?

37:21.337 --> 37:22.405
You know, when it
comes down to it,

37:22.439 --> 37:23.974
all guys want the same thing.

37:24.008 --> 37:25.809
And what's that?

37:25.842 --> 37:28.012
A good girl.

37:28.045 --> 37:29.546
I don't seem to remember

37:29.579 --> 37:32.615
you were that much
of a good girl in med school.

37:32.649 --> 37:33.850
Well, Fred... Thanks.

37:33.883 --> 37:35.485
Fred didn't know me at school.

37:35.518 --> 37:37.987
He met me when I was
working at L'Oréal.

37:38.022 --> 37:39.589
Poor Fred.

37:39.622 --> 37:43.860
What he doesn't know
won't kill him, right?

37:43.893 --> 37:45.729
I'm glad everything
has worked out

37:45.762 --> 37:46.963
so well for you, Madison.

37:46.996 --> 37:47.964
Thanks.

37:47.997 --> 37:49.532
- It really has.
- Yeah.

37:51.434 --> 37:53.570
You know, I actually
wanted to meet you today

37:53.603 --> 37:55.972
to talk about something
in particular.

37:56.005 --> 37:57.507
I did wonder.

37:57.540 --> 37:59.542
No one's heard from you
in, like, forever.

38:00.610 --> 38:03.480
I wanted to talk to you
about why I dropped out.

38:05.982 --> 38:07.350
Okay, sure.

38:07.383 --> 38:09.753
You remember
what happened, right?

38:11.921 --> 38:14.491
Um, s-such a long time ago now.

38:14.524 --> 38:16.726
I know, but you remember.

38:18.061 --> 38:20.396
I mean, vaguely.

38:20.430 --> 38:22.766
Do you ever think about it?

38:24.801 --> 38:26.002
Why would I?

38:26.035 --> 38:28.471
Right. Why would you?

38:30.406 --> 38:32.475
So, if a friend came to you now,

38:32.509 --> 38:37.346
into your house, and told you
that they thought something bad

38:37.380 --> 38:38.915
had happened to them
the night before...

38:38.948 --> 38:41.050
- Cassie...
- Something bad.

38:41.084 --> 38:43.052
- It was years ago.
- What would you say?

38:43.086 --> 38:44.921
It w...

38:44.954 --> 38:48.357
- What would you say?
- Ugh. I'm so...

38:49.025 --> 38:50.593
I feel a little weird.

38:50.627 --> 38:52.996
Would you roll your eyes
behind her back

38:53.029 --> 38:54.664
and dismiss the whole thing
as drama?

38:54.697 --> 38:56.800
I don't know
why you're mad at me.

38:56.833 --> 38:59.502
Okay, I-I'm not the only one
who didn't believe it.

38:59.536 --> 39:01.805
If-if you have a reputation
for sleeping around,

39:01.838 --> 39:03.773
then maybe people
aren't gonna believe you

39:03.807 --> 39:05.842
when you say
something's happened.

39:05.875 --> 39:08.111
I mean...

39:08.144 --> 39:10.847
it's crying wolf.

39:12.514 --> 39:14.383
You thought it was crying wolf?

39:14.416 --> 39:16.451
I don't make the rules.

39:16.485 --> 39:19.421
Look, when you get that drunk,
things happen.

39:19.454 --> 39:22.125
Don't get blackout drunk
all the time

39:22.158 --> 39:24.426
and then expect people
to be on your side

39:24.459 --> 39:26.696
when you have sex
with someone you don't want to.

39:26.729 --> 39:28.865
I mean...

39:31.067 --> 39:32.836
That's a shame.

39:32.869 --> 39:35.571
I was hoping you'd feel
differently by now.

39:35.604 --> 39:37.040
- Sorry.
- For your sake,

39:37.073 --> 39:39.441
I was hoping you'd feel
different by now.

39:44.446 --> 39:46.115
Look... look, don't be mad.

39:46.149 --> 39:47.984
Just, I'll get the check,
all right?

39:48.017 --> 39:49.953
It's my treat.

39:49.986 --> 39:51.687
Hello?

39:53.022 --> 39:54.858
Are you okay, Madison?

39:56.025 --> 39:58.161
My head is spinning.
I just feel...

39:58.194 --> 40:00.129
Oh! Shit.

40:00.163 --> 40:01.865
My God.

40:01.898 --> 40:03.632
Sorry.

40:05.601 --> 40:09.438
It really is so great
seeing you again.

40:09.471 --> 40:12.441
You really haven't
changed at all.

40:13.109 --> 40:14.978
That's great.

40:18.947 --> 40:20.916
So?

40:22.051 --> 40:24.686
She's over there.

40:24.720 --> 40:27.023
Room 25.

40:27.056 --> 40:29.758
Your money's in the envelope.

40:29.791 --> 40:31.894
You sure about this?

40:31.927 --> 40:33.896
I'm sure.

40:54.483 --> 40:55.918
Cassie, hi.

40:55.951 --> 40:58.787
Um, wonderful to see you
for lunch yesterday.

40:58.820 --> 41:00.789
Blast from the past.

41:00.822 --> 41:02.157
Uh, hey.

41:02.190 --> 41:04.059
I was pretty drunk.

41:04.092 --> 41:05.961
I can't really, um...

41:05.994 --> 41:09.932
Look, did you see me talking
to a guy, like, our age?

41:09.965 --> 41:11.633
He seemed to know you.

41:11.667 --> 41:14.102
Just trying to piece
some things together.

41:15.671 --> 41:17.940
Cassie, sorry.
Please call me back.

41:17.973 --> 41:19.608
I-I'm freaking out a little.

41:19.641 --> 41:21.810
I woke up in
one of the hotel rooms.

41:21.843 --> 41:23.545
I-I think something
might have happened.

41:23.578 --> 41:25.480
I-I don't know.

41:48.971 --> 41:50.539
Your place, right?

41:55.310 --> 41:56.778
- See you tomorrow, bitches.
- Bye, Amber.

41:56.812 --> 41:58.714
- Excuse me.
- Bye.

41:58.747 --> 42:01.116
Excuse me! Hi.

42:01.149 --> 42:02.584
- Me?
- Yeah.

42:02.617 --> 42:04.052
Hi. Sorry.

42:04.086 --> 42:05.187
What's up?

42:05.220 --> 42:06.989
I'm so sorry,
but my-my phone has died,

42:07.022 --> 42:08.256
and I'm so late for work.

42:08.290 --> 42:10.292
Do you live around here?
Do you know the area?

42:10.325 --> 42:11.860
I guess. Why?

42:11.893 --> 42:14.262
Would you tell me how to get
to the Castle Diner?

42:14.296 --> 42:16.597
You know what?
I'm actually, like, really late.

42:16.630 --> 42:18.266
Please. I'm supposed to be
shooting this music video,

42:18.300 --> 42:19.667
- and I...
- Music video?

42:19.701 --> 42:21.136
Uh, yeah, I'm-I'm
a makeup artist, and it's

42:21.169 --> 42:23.772
my first time working with
these guys, and if I'm late,

42:23.805 --> 42:25.874
- I may as well not...
- Oh, my God.

42:25.907 --> 42:26.875
Oh, my God.

42:26.908 --> 42:28.243
Are you working for Wet Dreams?

42:28.276 --> 42:29.677
You didn't see that.

42:29.710 --> 42:30.678
I know where
the Castle Diner is.

42:30.711 --> 42:31.579
Don't worry about it.

42:31.612 --> 42:32.513
- I'll ask someone else.
- No way. No way.

42:32.546 --> 42:35.150
Oh, my God, you're working
with Wet Dreams!

42:35.183 --> 42:37.252
Oh, my God!
Are they there right now?

42:37.285 --> 42:39.287
You need to calm down, please.

42:39.321 --> 42:40.755
I can direct you. Please.

42:40.788 --> 42:42.656
Sorry. No.

42:42.690 --> 42:46.028
If I don't direct you,
how are you gonna find it?

42:46.061 --> 42:47.295
I can't.

42:47.329 --> 42:49.764
If you tell anyone
or you post about this,

42:49.797 --> 42:51.665
I will never work again.

42:51.699 --> 42:53.201
I swear I won't post anything.

42:53.235 --> 42:54.336
I promise.

42:54.369 --> 42:56.704
Take my phone.
Seriously, take it.

42:57.705 --> 42:59.174
Ugh! God, okay.

42:59.207 --> 43:00.275
Get in. Fine.

43:00.308 --> 43:02.244
But you have to be
cool about this.

43:02.277 --> 43:04.179
No. Of course I will.

43:06.914 --> 43:08.050
Whoa.

43:08.083 --> 43:09.717
You really are a fan.

43:09.750 --> 43:11.819
I'm obsessed.
I have a whole Insta

43:11.852 --> 43:13.155
dedicated just to George's dog.

43:13.188 --> 43:15.323
What a crazy coincidence.

43:15.357 --> 43:16.657
I know.

43:16.690 --> 43:18.592
You know what?

43:18.626 --> 43:20.594
This... this is fate.

43:20.628 --> 43:24.099
Sure seems like it, huh?

43:36.644 --> 43:38.646
Yes?

43:40.848 --> 43:44.051
Dean Walker is ready,
if you'd like to go on through.

43:53.694 --> 43:55.830
Daisy.

43:55.863 --> 43:57.865
- That's me.
- Dean Walker.

43:57.898 --> 43:59.133
Please sit.

44:00.734 --> 44:03.305
My assistant says that
you are interested

44:03.338 --> 44:05.272
in resuming med school.

44:05.306 --> 44:06.674
That's right.

44:06.707 --> 44:08.410
May I ask what prompted
your desire

44:08.443 --> 44:10.177
to get back to your studies?

44:10.211 --> 44:12.380
I guess...

44:12.414 --> 44:14.949
I couldn't stop thinking
about my time here.

44:14.982 --> 44:17.118
Yeah.
It's an extraordinary place.

44:18.152 --> 44:19.987
It's an unusual request.

44:20.020 --> 44:23.390
Yes, but I left under
unusual circumstances.

44:23.425 --> 44:24.825
Oh.

44:24.859 --> 44:27.261
I left because of
what happened to Nina.

44:27.294 --> 44:28.362
Hmm.

44:28.395 --> 44:30.331
Nina Fisher.

44:30.364 --> 44:31.966
You don't remember her?

44:31.999 --> 44:36.203
Maybe you remember
Alexander Monroe?

44:36.237 --> 44:37.938
Oh, yes. Alexander Monroe.

44:37.972 --> 44:41.008
He actually just came back
and gave a talk here.

44:41.041 --> 44:43.744
Oh, he's a...
he's a really nice guy.

44:43.777 --> 44:44.879
Really smart.

44:44.912 --> 44:46.714
- Are you a friend of his?
- No.

44:46.747 --> 44:47.948
So, you don't remember

44:47.982 --> 44:49.950
the accusations made
against Al Monroe?

44:49.984 --> 44:51.452
I don't.

44:51.485 --> 44:54.822
He took a girl, Nina Fisher,

44:54.855 --> 44:58.826
the one you don't remember,
back to his room,

44:58.859 --> 45:01.162
where he had sex with her
repeatedly

45:01.195 --> 45:02.429
and in front of his friends

45:02.463 --> 45:06.033
while she was too drunk to have
any idea what was going on.

45:06.066 --> 45:08.402
She was covered in bruises
the next day.

45:08.435 --> 45:11.405
Handprints,
I guess you could say.

45:11.438 --> 45:13.374
Was it reported?

45:13.407 --> 45:14.808
Yes.

45:14.842 --> 45:16.844
Do you know who Nina spoke to?

45:17.945 --> 45:19.079
You.

45:21.282 --> 45:23.450
But you can't remember, so...

45:23.484 --> 45:25.718
You felt there wasn't
sufficient evidence.

45:25.752 --> 45:27.021
You said it was too much

45:27.054 --> 45:30.124
of a "he said, she said"
situation.

45:30.157 --> 45:31.258
Well...

45:31.292 --> 45:35.795
you know, we get accusations
like this all the time.

45:35.828 --> 45:37.198
One or two a week.

45:37.231 --> 45:39.866
I'm sorry I don't remember
your friend Nina,

45:39.900 --> 45:41.468
but I can assure you,
at that time,

45:41.502 --> 45:43.204
that I looked into it
thoroughly.

45:43.237 --> 45:47.308
His friends were all
watching, laughing.

45:47.341 --> 45:48.808
It's so hard.

45:48.841 --> 45:50.777
But, you know, also,
if she was drinking

45:50.810 --> 45:53.846
and-and maybe couldn't
remember everything...

45:53.880 --> 45:55.949
So, she shouldn't
have been drunk?

45:55.983 --> 45:58.385
- I'm not saying that. I...
- I'm sorry, I don't...

45:58.419 --> 46:00.454
I don't mean
to sound critical, Dean Walker.

46:00.487 --> 46:02.855
I just want to be clear.

46:02.889 --> 46:05.092
None of us want to admit

46:05.125 --> 46:06.993
when we've made ourselves
vulnerable.

46:07.026 --> 46:08.962
When we've made a bad choice.

46:08.995 --> 46:11.098
And those choices,
those mistakes,

46:11.131 --> 46:15.102
can be so damaging
and really regrettable.

46:17.538 --> 46:19.506
- Regrettable?
- Yes.

46:19.540 --> 46:21.508
I mean, because
what would you have me do?

46:21.542 --> 46:23.410
Ruin a young man's life

46:23.444 --> 46:26.079
every time we get
an accusation like this?

46:26.112 --> 46:28.948
So you're happy to take
the boy's word for it?

46:28.982 --> 46:31.117
I have to give him
the benefit of the doubt.

46:31.150 --> 46:31.951
Of course you do.

46:31.985 --> 46:34.787
Because innocent
until proven guilty.

46:34.821 --> 46:37.291
No arguing with that.

46:37.324 --> 46:39.393
No.

46:39.426 --> 46:41.295
Thank you for your time.

46:42.296 --> 46:44.331
- Is your friend okay?
- No.

46:44.365 --> 46:45.865
She's not.

46:45.898 --> 46:47.568
But Al Monroe is.

46:47.601 --> 46:49.869
You'll be glad to hear
he's doing really well.

46:49.902 --> 46:52.939
- He's getting married, actually, so...
- Hmm.

46:52.972 --> 46:54.341
You know, I guess you did
the right thing.

46:54.375 --> 46:58.177
We have to give these boys
the benefit of the doubt.

46:58.211 --> 47:00.146
That's why I know
you won't mind that,

47:00.179 --> 47:03.116
three hours ago, I picked your
daughter Amber up from school

47:03.149 --> 47:05.985
and introduced her to the boys
who live in that room now.

47:06.019 --> 47:08.288
- What?
- She is really pretty, huh?

47:08.321 --> 47:10.356
She looks
a lot older than she is.

47:10.390 --> 47:12.593
- I don't believe you.
- I noticed they had a few

47:12.626 --> 47:14.327
bottles of vodka
in their room, too.

47:14.360 --> 47:17.030
But I'm sure they'll take
good care of your daughter.

47:17.063 --> 47:18.599
She seemed excited, actually.

47:28.441 --> 47:29.543
Oh, wait.

47:29.576 --> 47:31.444
I have her phone.

47:31.477 --> 47:33.880
She'll be wanting that later.

47:35.548 --> 47:37.383
You're crazy.

47:37.417 --> 47:39.052
No.

47:39.085 --> 47:41.988
Tell me what room
my daughter is in right now.

47:42.021 --> 47:44.857
I told you...
the same room Nina was in.

47:44.891 --> 47:47.327
I told you
I don't remember that.

47:47.360 --> 47:48.961
Well, that's a shame.

47:49.663 --> 47:51.864
What are you doing?

47:51.898 --> 47:53.399
She is a young girl.

47:53.433 --> 47:57.170
I wonder if she looks so young
to those guys.

47:57.203 --> 47:59.572
You better tell me
what room she's in.

47:59.605 --> 48:02.875
Tell me what fucking room
she's in!

48:02.909 --> 48:05.078
Now, you sociopath!

48:05.111 --> 48:07.513
Tell me where she is!

48:07.547 --> 48:09.349
Right now!

48:09.382 --> 48:11.984
Tell me what room she's in!

48:13.152 --> 48:14.854
Please!

48:16.556 --> 48:19.025
Please tell me.

48:28.668 --> 48:31.371
You're right, okay?

48:31.404 --> 48:33.973
Is that what you want to hear?

48:34.006 --> 48:36.075
You're right.

48:38.010 --> 48:40.113
You're right.

48:44.016 --> 48:46.552
Look how easy it was.

48:46.586 --> 48:50.022
I guess you just had to think
about it in the right way.

48:51.157 --> 48:52.658
I guess it feels different

48:52.692 --> 48:55.061
when it's someone you love.

48:57.296 --> 49:00.266
Tell me where
my daughter is, please.

49:10.576 --> 49:12.043
Relax.

49:12.077 --> 49:13.546
Dean Walker,
do you really think

49:13.579 --> 49:15.147
I would do something like that?

49:15.181 --> 49:18.049
Luckily, I don't have as much
faith in boys as you do.

49:18.083 --> 49:20.185
Amber is sitting in a diner,

49:20.219 --> 49:22.622
waiting for her favorite
boy band to show up

49:22.655 --> 49:24.424
for a music video.

49:24.457 --> 49:27.293
It's the Castle Diner,
if you want to call and check.

49:27.326 --> 49:29.362
Or you should probably call,
actually,

49:29.395 --> 49:32.063
or she may never figure out
they're not coming.

49:32.097 --> 49:34.199
She's kind of an idiot, huh?

49:35.334 --> 49:36.436
Gorgeous, though.

49:36.469 --> 49:38.136
Who needs brains?

49:38.170 --> 49:40.706
They never did a girl any good.

49:40.740 --> 49:43.241
Great to see you again,
Dean Walker.

49:56.388 --> 49:58.724
Hey! You're blocking the road!

49:58.758 --> 50:02.194
Get out of the fucking road!

50:02.227 --> 50:04.329
What the fuck is wrong with you?

50:04.362 --> 50:07.065
Hey. Hey!

50:07.098 --> 50:09.201
You're sitting in the middle
of the intersection.

50:09.234 --> 50:11.002
How'd you get your license?

50:11.036 --> 50:13.338
You blow the entire DMV?

50:13.371 --> 50:14.774
Hello.

50:14.807 --> 50:16.475
I'm talking to you.

50:16.508 --> 50:18.343
Look at me, you stupid cunt.

50:19.712 --> 50:22.147
Huh?

50:22.180 --> 50:23.548
You want to have a face...
Okay, yeah.

50:23.583 --> 50:24.750
Come on over. Let's do this.

50:24.784 --> 50:25.918
Where are you going?

50:25.952 --> 50:28.587
You're just gonna leave
your car in the intersection?

50:28.621 --> 50:30.388
You coming over here? Huh?

50:30.422 --> 50:32.357
Are you angry?

50:36.394 --> 50:37.730
Holy shit!

50:37.763 --> 50:39.799
Is that a fucking tire iron?

50:39.832 --> 50:42.167
You psycho!

50:42.200 --> 50:43.769
Just chill out, okay?

50:43.803 --> 50:46.371
Why don't you calm down.

50:46.404 --> 50:47.639
Oh! Okay.

50:47.672 --> 50:49.541
Whoa! Stop! Stop, stop, stop!

50:50.843 --> 50:53.211
Crazy fucking bitch.

50:54.546 --> 50:56.816
Excuse me?

50:56.849 --> 50:58.783
Fuck you.

51:28.847 --> 51:31.182
Fuck.

51:42.460 --> 51:43.662
Ryan, what are...?

51:43.695 --> 51:44.796
She lives.

51:44.829 --> 51:46.831
I'm just kidding. You weren't
answering your phone,

51:46.865 --> 51:49.134
- so I was...
- Oh, shit. The movie.

51:49.167 --> 51:51.503
Oh, I-I'm so sorry.
I had to work late.

51:52.470 --> 51:54.205
Yeah, I-I went by
the coffee shop.

51:54.239 --> 51:56.808
Gail said you took the day off.

51:56.841 --> 51:58.643
- Um...
- Everything all right?

51:58.677 --> 52:00.178
Yeah.

52:00.211 --> 52:02.213
No, I'm fine. I'm just in
the middle of something.

52:02.247 --> 52:05.115
Totally. Got it.
We can make the movie still

52:05.149 --> 52:06.183
if we skip dinner.

52:06.217 --> 52:08.286
Um, I'm a little tired.

52:08.320 --> 52:09.788
- Yeah.
- Um, do you mind if I call you tomorrow?

52:09.821 --> 52:10.855
Sure. Great.

52:10.889 --> 52:13.190
- Okay.
- Are you okay, though?

52:13.223 --> 52:15.527
You seem kind of...

52:15.560 --> 52:17.462
What?

52:17.495 --> 52:20.765
Uh... off.

52:20.799 --> 52:23.602
No, um, I'm fine.
I'm just...

52:23.635 --> 52:25.403
Too-too much... too much coffee.

52:25.437 --> 52:27.339
Don't work in a coffee shop.

52:27.372 --> 52:28.807
Okay.

52:28.840 --> 52:30.508
All right, night.

52:30.542 --> 52:32.477
All right, good night.

53:01.539 --> 53:03.307
Here we go.

53:03.340 --> 53:05.577
- Yeah, but you watch your step here.
- Whoop!

53:05.610 --> 53:08.245
Now, when we get to the house,
you got to be quiet,

53:08.278 --> 53:10.447
'cause I don't know if
my parents are asleep or not.

53:10.481 --> 53:13.183
- Okay. Mm.
- We got to be respectful.

53:13.217 --> 53:15.552
This is fucking surge prices.

53:15.586 --> 53:17.656
1.2? That's...

53:18.990 --> 53:20.424
I mean, it's not that far.

53:20.457 --> 53:22.259
- You can walk, right?
- I don't know.

53:22.292 --> 53:23.662
Let's try. Let's go.

53:23.695 --> 53:24.929
Come on, now.

53:24.963 --> 53:26.463
Whoop, there we go.

53:26.497 --> 53:28.800
You got it. That was fun.

53:28.833 --> 53:30.802
Yeah.

53:30.835 --> 53:33.805
Cassie?

53:33.838 --> 53:35.406
Ryan.

53:35.439 --> 53:37.976
What are you doing here?

53:38.009 --> 53:40.344
I'm meeting friends

53:40.377 --> 53:44.581
'cause my schedule
cleared up last minute.

53:44.615 --> 53:45.850
Let me explain.

53:45.884 --> 53:47.284
It's fine. It's...

53:47.317 --> 53:48.552
Uh, my bad, dude.

53:48.585 --> 53:50.922
I didn't know
the woman was taken, but...

53:50.955 --> 53:52.589
- She's...
- She's all yours, man.

53:52.623 --> 53:54.525
All mine?

53:54.558 --> 53:56.427
Uh...

53:56.460 --> 53:58.762
Do you know her name or...?

53:58.796 --> 54:00.364
Claire?

54:00.397 --> 54:02.332
- Wow.
- Pretty close.

54:02.366 --> 54:03.935
Okay. Have a good night.

54:03.968 --> 54:05.636
Don't go, Ryan. Wait, please.

54:05.669 --> 54:07.438
Cassie, if you didn't...
if you weren't interested,

54:07.471 --> 54:09.941
just, you could've just told me.

54:11.742 --> 54:13.711
That's ice-cold.

54:13.744 --> 54:15.279
That was humiliating.

54:15.312 --> 54:17.715
Why don't you just
fuck off now, okay?

54:17.748 --> 54:20.651
Wait, are you sober?

54:20.684 --> 54:22.386
Oh, shit.

54:22.419 --> 54:24.388
You're that psycho
that Jerry took home.

54:24.421 --> 54:25.756
I don't know
what you're talking about.

54:25.789 --> 54:27.558
You know what?
Not interested, sweetheart.

54:27.591 --> 54:29.727
Nah. Why don't you take
your crazy somewhere else.

54:29.760 --> 54:32.329
You're not even that hot.

54:32.362 --> 54:35.666
You're hardly dropping
panties yourself, Paul.

54:35.699 --> 54:39.236
When was the last time
you scored in daylight?

54:40.637 --> 54:41.839
Careful.

54:41.872 --> 54:44.575
No, you be careful.

54:44.608 --> 54:47.377
I'm not the only one
who does this.

54:47.411 --> 54:50.647
And some of the other girls,
they really are crazy.

54:52.783 --> 54:54.418
I-I don't believe you.

54:54.451 --> 54:58.388
There's a woman in this city
that carries a pair of scissors.

55:00.424 --> 55:02.025
You're-you're lying.

55:02.059 --> 55:04.628
Hmm. Try it out
next time you go out.

55:04.661 --> 55:06.730
See what happens.

55:08.899 --> 55:10.334
Why?

55:10.367 --> 55:12.870
Why you guys have to ruin
everything?!

55:35.092 --> 55:36.894
Can I help you?

55:36.927 --> 55:38.729
I really hope so.

55:38.762 --> 55:41.665
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm no longer
practicing the law,

55:41.698 --> 55:43.934
if that's what you've come for.

55:43.967 --> 55:46.003
It's not about that.

55:46.036 --> 55:48.872
I'm afraid it's
your day of reckoning.

55:50.874 --> 55:53.911
I've been waiting.

55:53.944 --> 55:55.646
Come in.

56:00.684 --> 56:04.054
<i>Your office told me
you're on sabbatical.</i>

56:04.087 --> 56:05.823
It was very easy
to get your address.

56:05.856 --> 56:07.124
They just gave it to me.

56:07.157 --> 56:09.960
I told them to give it
to anyone who asked.

56:09.993 --> 56:11.594
That doesn't seem safe.

56:11.627 --> 56:14.330
No use hiding from the piper.

56:15.464 --> 56:16.900
He has to be paid.

56:17.935 --> 56:19.036
I guess so.

56:19.069 --> 56:23.073
You seem nervous, Mr. Green.

56:23.106 --> 56:25.474
I came here to talk to you
about something

56:25.508 --> 56:27.110
that happened seven years ago.

56:27.144 --> 56:29.046
You probably
won't remember a client

56:29.079 --> 56:31.148
named Alexander Monroe.

56:31.181 --> 56:34.550
You helped so many boys
like him.

56:34.584 --> 56:36.619
And you most certainly
won't remember the girl

56:36.652 --> 56:39.555
who you threatened and bullied
till she dropped her case.

56:41.859 --> 56:43.894
I remember her.

56:46.096 --> 56:47.697
Nina?

56:48.764 --> 56:49.832
Was that it?

56:49.866 --> 56:53.603
I'm sorry, I don't remember
her full name, but...

56:55.471 --> 56:57.840
It was Nina, though, wasn't it?

57:00.743 --> 57:02.079
Yes.

57:02.112 --> 57:04.480
I remember her.

57:10.053 --> 57:12.521
Have you come here to hurt me?

57:14.924 --> 57:17.526
Do you want me to hurt you?

57:18.928 --> 57:20.663
I think so.

57:23.699 --> 57:27.536
I-I had a... what I think
was a-an epiphany,

57:27.570 --> 57:32.742
but my doctors called it
a psychotic episode.

57:34.610 --> 57:37.647
And it was at work, so...

57:37.680 --> 57:40.917
so now I'm on a sabbatical.

57:42.785 --> 57:46.989
You know, I got a bonus for
every settlement out of court.

57:47.023 --> 57:50.092
I got another bonus
for every charge dropped.

57:50.126 --> 57:51.994
We all did.
There was a guy...

57:53.330 --> 57:57.633
His only job was to comb through
all their social media accounts

57:57.667 --> 58:00.536
for any compromising
information.

58:00.569 --> 58:03.606
He contacted old friends,
past sexual partners.

58:03.639 --> 58:05.675
Oh, you'd be amazed
how much easier it is now

58:05.708 --> 58:07.677
with the Internet
to dig up dirt.

58:07.710 --> 58:10.947
In the old days, we'd have to
go through a girl's trash.

58:10.980 --> 58:13.950
Now one drunk photo at a party.

58:13.983 --> 58:18.020
Oh, you wouldn't believe
how hostile that makes a jury.

58:20.523 --> 58:22.458
You got to help me.

58:24.126 --> 58:25.995
I can't sleep.

58:27.129 --> 58:29.598
I can't sleep.

58:30.900 --> 58:32.802
I haven't slept in...

58:36.038 --> 58:38.841
I'll never forgive myself.

58:40.309 --> 58:42.645
I want you to know that.

58:44.280 --> 58:49.018
I'll never forgive myself
for any of this.

58:54.890 --> 58:58.593
I forgive you.

59:02.630 --> 59:05.001
I'm so sorry.

59:13.175 --> 59:15.011
Go to sleep.

59:32.928 --> 59:35.031
Do I go in now?

59:37.832 --> 59:39.634
- No.
- Oh.

59:39.667 --> 59:42.804
I'm stilling getting paid,
though, right?

59:44.073 --> 59:45.975
Yeah.

1:00:05.361 --> 1:00:07.629
Cassie?

1:00:13.768 --> 1:00:15.737
Do you remember
Nina's 16th birthday party?

1:00:15.770 --> 1:00:19.007
Oh, my gosh.
How could I forget?

1:00:19.040 --> 1:00:20.842
I was such a mess.

1:00:20.875 --> 1:00:22.677
Nina threw up on the swing.

1:00:22.710 --> 1:00:25.947
Mm-hmm. Certainly not
her finest moment.

1:00:25.980 --> 1:00:28.683
And that boy
who stole your vase.

1:00:28.716 --> 1:00:31.152
And she made him bring it
back to you and apologize.

1:00:32.254 --> 1:00:33.822
He was so scared of her.

1:00:33.855 --> 1:00:34.923
She was holding onto his ear.

1:00:34.956 --> 1:00:37.359
"You better say you're sorry
to my mom, you asshole."

1:00:39.094 --> 1:00:41.830
What was his name?

1:00:41.863 --> 1:00:45.934
Simon or Steve or something.

1:00:50.138 --> 1:00:52.140
Why are you here?

1:00:55.743 --> 1:00:58.113
I just wanted to see you.

1:00:58.146 --> 1:00:59.848
You need to stop this.

1:00:59.881 --> 1:01:01.417
It isn't good for any of us.

1:01:01.450 --> 1:01:03.785
It's no good for Nina.

1:01:03.818 --> 1:01:06.721
It isn't good for you.

1:01:06.754 --> 1:01:09.224
Look, I know you feel bad
that you weren't there,

1:01:09.257 --> 1:01:11.126
but you got to let it go.

1:01:16.264 --> 1:01:18.066
I'm just trying to fix it.

1:01:18.099 --> 1:01:20.869
Oh, come on. You can't.

1:01:20.902 --> 1:01:23.671
Don't be a child, Cassie.

1:01:26.708 --> 1:01:29.010
I'm so sorry
I didn't go with her.

1:01:29.043 --> 1:01:31.379
No.

1:01:31.412 --> 1:01:33.348
I'm sorry, too.

1:01:49.130 --> 1:01:51.099
Cassie.

1:01:51.132 --> 1:01:52.901
Move on.

1:01:52.934 --> 1:01:54.402
Please.

1:01:54.435 --> 1:01:56.804
For all of us.

1:03:05.373 --> 1:03:08.141
Oh, great, it's you.

1:03:08.176 --> 1:03:10.077
Can I come in?

1:03:13.013 --> 1:03:14.315
Yep.

1:03:15.849 --> 1:03:17.851
Do you want something?
Do you want a coffee?

1:03:17.884 --> 1:03:21.256
Or another dude to go home with?

1:03:21.289 --> 1:03:22.523
Yeah, actually.

1:03:22.557 --> 1:03:24.259
Do you have any douchebags
lying around?

1:03:24.292 --> 1:03:27.828
Yeah. There's
a racist on the eighth floor.

1:03:27.861 --> 1:03:29.963
- Yeah.
- Perfect.

1:03:31.299 --> 1:03:34.768
What do you want, Cassie?

1:03:35.436 --> 1:03:38.038
I came to apologize about...

1:03:38.071 --> 1:03:39.339
Oh.

1:03:39.374 --> 1:03:42.410
I've been trying to think
about how to explain.

1:03:46.880 --> 1:03:50.183
It's not that
I'm not interested.

1:03:50.217 --> 1:03:53.287
- Mm.
- I really am.

1:03:53.320 --> 1:03:55.122
I really, really am.

1:03:55.155 --> 1:03:56.423
Okay.

1:03:56.457 --> 1:03:57.958
Sorry if I'm confused.

1:03:57.991 --> 1:03:59.293
It...
You...

1:03:59.326 --> 1:04:01.295
Sorry, we...
we've been on a couple dates.

1:04:01.328 --> 1:04:06.333
Um, you won't kiss me
or touch me, which is fine.

1:04:06.366 --> 1:04:09.870
And then I see you going home

1:04:09.903 --> 1:04:13.073
with some random creep
in a fedora.

1:04:15.042 --> 1:04:18.078
I admit, the fedora
was unforgivable.

1:04:21.515 --> 1:04:24.384
The other night...

1:04:24.418 --> 1:04:28.255
It's hard to explain it,
but it won't happen again.

1:04:28.288 --> 1:04:31.091
I promise,
it'll never happen again.

1:04:32.225 --> 1:04:34.461
Can we try again?

1:04:34.494 --> 1:04:37.397
Can I, I mean.

1:04:38.565 --> 1:04:40.334
I don't...

1:04:40.367 --> 1:04:42.269
I don't know.

1:04:45.339 --> 1:04:46.973
Are you okay?

1:04:50.177 --> 1:04:51.445
Um...

1:04:52.612 --> 1:04:55.148
It's fine. I'm...

1:04:55.182 --> 1:04:58.385
I guess I'll see you around.

1:05:39.192 --> 1:05:41.395
We're closed.

1:05:41.428 --> 1:05:43.397
Good.

1:05:52.439 --> 1:05:56.443
Do you want to go to dinner,
you miserable asshole?

1:06:01.715 --> 1:06:03.316
Yeah.

1:06:31.411 --> 1:06:34.213
Shit.

1:06:36.483 --> 1:06:38.752
First trip to
the pharmacy together.

1:06:38.785 --> 1:06:40.587
Yeah.

1:06:40.620 --> 1:06:42.321

- That's weird.
- Literally weeks.

1:08:33.866 --> 1:08:35.501
Thank you.

1:08:35.534 --> 1:08:36.869
Sorry.

1:08:36.902 --> 1:08:38.571
They're okay.

1:08:41.407 --> 1:08:43.242
Cheese?

1:08:43.275 --> 1:08:44.376
Would love it.

1:08:44.410 --> 1:08:46.445
Yeah. Thank you.

1:08:48.714 --> 1:08:50.583
- Bread?
- Ah, yep.

1:08:50.616 --> 1:08:52.451
Okay.

1:08:53.686 --> 1:08:56.154
Mm. Oh. Thank you.

1:08:56.187 --> 1:08:57.856
What a home.
It's unbelievable.

1:08:57.890 --> 1:08:59.725
- So beautiful.
- Yeah, it's nice.

1:08:59.758 --> 1:09:00.893
Susan works really hard.

1:09:00.926 --> 1:09:03.127
- Yeah, it shows.
- Yeah.

1:09:03.161 --> 1:09:05.598
Eat, eat, before it gets cold.

1:09:05.631 --> 1:09:06.732
This looks delicious.

1:09:06.765 --> 1:09:08.867
- Oh. Oh.
- Thank you.

1:09:08.901 --> 1:09:10.603
I made the sauce.

1:09:10.636 --> 1:09:12.638
The sauce is...

1:09:14.840 --> 1:09:16.341
Mm.

1:09:16.375 --> 1:09:18.510
The sauce is really good.

1:09:19.645 --> 1:09:21.447
- Incredible.
- Mm.

1:09:22.648 --> 1:09:25.484
Ryan, I hear you're a doctor.

1:09:25.517 --> 1:09:27.720
Your parents must be
very, very proud.

1:09:29.220 --> 1:09:31.724
Not really.
Uh, they wanted me to be a DJ.

1:09:39.898 --> 1:09:41.432
He's funny.

1:09:41.466 --> 1:09:43.301
Yeah.

1:09:43.334 --> 1:09:44.536
That's funny.

1:09:44.570 --> 1:09:46.905
You didn't say
he was funny, Cassie.

1:09:46.939 --> 1:09:49.507
- Dad.
- You didn't say I was...

1:09:49.540 --> 1:09:52.176
- You didn't say I was funny?
- No.

1:09:52.210 --> 1:09:54.178
I said you were boring but rich.

1:09:54.212 --> 1:09:56.314
I am boring. Not that rich.

1:09:56.347 --> 1:09:57.716
No? Well, in that case,

1:09:57.750 --> 1:09:58.917
thanks for stopping by, kid.

1:10:00.318 --> 1:10:02.520
What kind of doctoring
do you do?

1:10:02.553 --> 1:10:04.857
Uh, pediatric, so...

1:10:04.890 --> 1:10:06.658
children.

1:10:06.692 --> 1:10:08.226
What was your, uh...

1:10:08.259 --> 1:10:10.729
What was that doctor's name?
Cassie's doctor.

1:10:10.763 --> 1:10:13.197
- Gary?
- Um, no.

1:10:13.231 --> 1:10:15.333
Dr. Katzen-something.

1:10:15.366 --> 1:10:17.568
Yeah. Dad, he was like 80.

1:10:17.602 --> 1:10:18.904
Yeah, well...

1:10:18.937 --> 1:10:20.773
You-you don't know
Dr. Katzen...?

1:10:20.806 --> 1:10:21.907
No.

1:10:21.940 --> 1:10:23.408
Now, I'm-I'm confused.

1:10:23.441 --> 1:10:27.545
Are there different parts
of the body on a child?

1:10:27.578 --> 1:10:29.848
No, it's pretty much
the same thing.

1:10:29.882 --> 1:10:30.983
You're just...

1:10:31.016 --> 1:10:33.251
You know, different-colored
Band-Aids and things.

1:10:33.284 --> 1:10:36.254
It's not brain surgery.

1:10:36.287 --> 1:10:37.655
Well...

1:10:37.689 --> 1:10:40.358
I get it. Yeah.

1:10:40.391 --> 1:10:41.826
Oh.

1:10:41.859 --> 1:10:44.295
This sauce is
absolutely unbelievable.

1:10:46.330 --> 1:10:47.699
Night, you two.

1:10:47.732 --> 1:10:49.400
Night.

1:10:53.905 --> 1:10:56.641
Thanks for
introducing us to Ryan.

1:10:59.044 --> 1:11:00.812
I know it was hard.

1:11:02.047 --> 1:11:04.482
You know, your mom, she's...

1:11:04.515 --> 1:11:10.354
Well, I mean,
we're both so glad that, uh...

1:11:11.022 --> 1:11:12.490
Oh, my God, Dad.

1:11:12.523 --> 1:11:13.991
He's not that nice.

1:11:14.025 --> 1:11:16.260
Yeah.

1:11:16.294 --> 1:11:19.297
Yeah, I must be tired.

1:11:19.330 --> 1:11:21.499
Okay.

1:11:24.035 --> 1:11:28.740
Honey, Nina was like
a daughter to us.

1:11:28.773 --> 1:11:30.341
You know that.

1:11:30.374 --> 1:11:32.577
We really miss her.

1:11:33.978 --> 1:11:36.848
But, God, we have missed you.

1:11:41.052 --> 1:11:43.020
See you tomorrow.

1:11:53.064 --> 1:11:55.800
<i>Your mom...
oh, your mom is hot.</i>

1:11:55.833 --> 1:11:57.034
Sorry.

1:11:57.068 --> 1:12:00.071
Your mom is extremely hot.

1:12:00.104 --> 1:12:02.339
Do you want her number?

1:12:03.074 --> 1:12:04.976
- I could hook you up.
- Really?

1:12:05.009 --> 1:12:06.376
Ooh.

1:12:06.410 --> 1:12:08.311
I think she likes you
more than I do.

1:12:08.345 --> 1:12:10.548
Well, I hope that's not true.

1:12:12.917 --> 1:12:15.285
Can I... Mm.

1:12:16.087 --> 1:12:18.055
Can I tell you something?

1:12:18.089 --> 1:12:19.857
Sure.

1:12:22.392 --> 1:12:24.394
I think you're amazing. I...

1:12:24.427 --> 1:12:26.531
- Oh, no, Ryan.
- Just shut up, you stupid bitch.

1:12:26.564 --> 1:12:27.932
- Please don't.
- Shh. I...

1:12:27.965 --> 1:12:29.867
- Just take this, please.
- Mm-hmm.

1:12:29.901 --> 1:12:32.036
I think you're incredible. I...

1:12:32.069 --> 1:12:34.639
I'm...

1:12:34.672 --> 1:12:38.408
I'm-I'm... I think
I'm falling in love with you.

1:12:42.713 --> 1:12:45.716
I think I'm falling
in love with you, too.

1:12:45.750 --> 1:12:46.416
Yes.

1:12:46.449 --> 1:12:47.919
- Oh, my God.
- Don't make...

1:12:47.952 --> 1:12:49.519
- Oh, my.
- Don't make a thing of it.

1:12:49.553 --> 1:12:51.421
- I'm gonna buy you a bicycle.
- No.

1:12:51.454 --> 1:12:53.691
- I want to buy you a bicycle.
- Ryan, be cool.

1:12:53.724 --> 1:12:55.392
I'm cool.

1:12:56.459 --> 1:12:58.129
I'm so cool.

1:12:58.162 --> 1:13:00.530
Oh, I'm the coolest.

1:13:06.603 --> 1:13:07.839
Cassie.

1:13:07.872 --> 1:13:10.107
Shit.

1:13:10.141 --> 1:13:12.375
Madison,
what are you doing here?

1:13:12.409 --> 1:13:13.911
Sorry. I, um...

1:13:13.945 --> 1:13:15.512
I tried calling.

1:13:15.545 --> 1:13:18.049
I left messages
about, uh, that guy.

1:13:18.082 --> 1:13:19.716
Your friend.

1:13:19.749 --> 1:13:22.619
Um, I don't know if-if your
phone number wasn't working.

1:13:22.652 --> 1:13:24.654
Maybe I had an old one.
I just... I mean...

1:13:24.688 --> 1:13:27.524
I know it seems kind of crazy,
me waiting on your porch

1:13:27.557 --> 1:13:29.559
like some kind of stalker
or something.

1:13:29.593 --> 1:13:31.494
Madison, I'm sorry.
I should've called you back.

1:13:31.528 --> 1:13:34.865
Nothing happened with that guy.
Please believe me.

1:13:34.898 --> 1:13:37.634
Are you sure? I...
But it seemed like...

1:13:37.667 --> 1:13:40.171
I know what it seemed like,
but it wasn't.

1:13:40.204 --> 1:13:41.838
He didn't touch you.

1:13:43.040 --> 1:13:45.475
Oh, thank God.

1:13:45.508 --> 1:13:47.944
Oh.

1:13:49.613 --> 1:13:52.515
Oh, I was...
I was so worried that, um...

1:13:52.549 --> 1:13:54.118
that I... that he and I, um...

1:13:54.151 --> 1:13:55.919
He just put you in bed.

1:13:55.952 --> 1:13:58.688
Kept an eye on you
to make sure you were okay.

1:13:58.722 --> 1:14:01.024
I'm really sorry
I didn't call you back.

1:14:01.057 --> 1:14:02.993
It wasn't nice.

1:14:03.026 --> 1:14:04.494
Yeah, well...

1:14:04.527 --> 1:14:06.763
God. Look, there...

1:14:08.165 --> 1:14:09.933
I need to show you something.

1:14:09.966 --> 1:14:12.102
Okay.

1:14:12.136 --> 1:14:14.404
Can we go inside?

1:14:16.006 --> 1:14:17.974
Yeah.

1:14:24.814 --> 1:14:27.717
Do you want a glass of water
or something?

1:14:27.751 --> 1:14:29.619
No, thank you.

1:14:43.066 --> 1:14:44.234
Oh.

1:14:44.267 --> 1:14:48.571
After we had lunch and...

1:14:48.605 --> 1:14:52.609
I got so drunk and woke up
in a hotel room with that guy,

1:14:52.642 --> 1:14:55.979
um, I thought about it.

1:14:56.012 --> 1:14:58.214
About what you said about Nina.

1:14:58.248 --> 1:15:01.551
And how we all
just acted like...

1:15:06.723 --> 1:15:09.893
And I remembered something.

1:15:09.926 --> 1:15:11.594
What?

1:15:15.131 --> 1:15:16.533
What?

1:15:18.068 --> 1:15:19.936
There was a tape.

1:15:24.107 --> 1:15:26.109
- What?
- A stupid video.

1:15:26.142 --> 1:15:28.211
It just got sent around.

1:15:28.244 --> 1:15:29.846
I got sent it.

1:15:29.879 --> 1:15:31.815
Everyone did.
At the time, it was...

1:15:32.682 --> 1:15:34.818
It was just gossip, you know?

1:15:34.851 --> 1:15:36.618
Gossip?

1:15:38.154 --> 1:15:42.759
So much stuff happened
back then, like, all the time.

1:15:42.792 --> 1:15:44.260
You know what it was like.

1:15:44.294 --> 1:15:46.196
It was just one blackout
after the next.

1:15:46.229 --> 1:15:49.099
I-I hoped I'd imagined it.

1:15:49.132 --> 1:15:50.934
But, um...

1:15:53.937 --> 1:15:56.840
I always saved all my phones
for photos or whatever.

1:15:56.873 --> 1:15:59.042
So, um...

1:16:00.810 --> 1:16:02.846
Here.

1:16:02.879 --> 1:16:06.548
I don't know how we all could
have watched it and, um...

1:16:08.918 --> 1:16:10.519
What?

1:16:11.187 --> 1:16:13.589
Thought it was funny.

1:16:17.760 --> 1:16:19.229
You can have the phone, okay?

1:16:19.262 --> 1:16:22.698
You don't have to watch it.
I really wouldn't watch it.

1:16:22.731 --> 1:16:25.035
But, um, I don't know,
do whatever you want with it.

1:16:25.068 --> 1:16:27.803
Just leave me out of it.

1:16:27.836 --> 1:16:29.671
And...

1:16:29.705 --> 1:16:32.008
please, will you do me a favor?

1:16:33.942 --> 1:16:35.111
Yeah.

1:16:37.213 --> 1:16:40.549
Never fucking contact me again.

1:17:36.238 --> 1:17:37.373
Al, get it!

1:17:37.407 --> 1:17:38.374
Come on, stop.

1:17:38.408 --> 1:17:39.908
Go on. Come on, come on.

1:17:39.942 --> 1:17:41.910
Shh, shh, shh.
Calm down, calm down.

1:17:41.944 --> 1:17:44.246
Oh, my God.

1:17:44.279 --> 1:17:45.681
Whoa. This is insane.

1:17:45.714 --> 1:17:46.982
Ryan, holy shit.
Come look at this.

1:17:47.015 --> 1:17:48.717
Man, you got to check this out.

1:17:48.750 --> 1:17:50.385
Yo, don't film me.
Dude, put the camera away.

1:17:50.419 --> 1:17:52.888
What are you fucking doing?
Oh, my God.

1:17:52.921 --> 1:17:55.190
Ryan, come on.

1:17:55.224 --> 1:17:56.859
This is fucked up.

1:17:59.294 --> 1:18:01.130
Jesus Christ.

1:18:01.163 --> 1:18:02.698
Al, Al.

1:19:09.031 --> 1:19:12.201
Cassie, what...
what are you doing here?

1:19:12.234 --> 1:19:13.502
Are-are you okay or...

1:19:13.535 --> 1:19:15.470
Can we go somewhere
to talk privately?

1:19:15.504 --> 1:19:17.805
I'm working.

1:19:17.838 --> 1:19:20.475
We need to talk right now.

1:19:20.509 --> 1:19:23.278
Okay.
What's... what's going on?

1:19:23.312 --> 1:19:26.281
- Everything all right or...?
- I've been such an asshole.

1:19:26.315 --> 1:19:28.050
What happened?

1:19:28.083 --> 1:19:31.153
I really thought for a second
it was all gonna be okay.

1:19:31.186 --> 1:19:32.987
Cassie.

1:19:35.856 --> 1:19:36.958
Look at this.

1:19:38.527 --> 1:19:40.761
What are you showing me?
What is this?

1:19:41.463 --> 1:19:42.997
- Is that Al Monroe?
- Mm.

1:19:44.865 --> 1:19:45.967
Oh, my God, it...

1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:46.968
Shh, shh, shh.

1:19:47.001 --> 1:19:48.135
Wait, is that... I don't...

1:19:48.170 --> 1:19:49.837
I don't want to look
at that, Cassie.

1:19:49.870 --> 1:19:50.972
Well, why not?

1:19:51.005 --> 1:19:52.241
You were happy to watch
back then.

1:19:52.274 --> 1:19:54.041
What are you talking about?
I wasn't...

1:19:54.075 --> 1:19:56.110
Oh, my God. Whoa.

1:19:56.143 --> 1:19:58.112
- This is insane.
- Ryan, holy shit.

1:19:58.145 --> 1:19:59.780
Come look at this.
Man, you got to check this out.

1:19:59.814 --> 1:20:01.516
Oh, shit.

1:20:01.550 --> 1:20:04.353
I don't... I don't remember.
Uh, I don't.

1:20:05.387 --> 1:20:07.221
Didn't make an impact, huh?

1:20:07.255 --> 1:20:09.324
I was a kid. I...

1:20:13.060 --> 1:20:14.962
I need you to do
something for me,

1:20:14.996 --> 1:20:18.799
and I want you to think
about it very carefully.

1:20:19.900 --> 1:20:22.169
I have this video

1:20:22.203 --> 1:20:24.539
ready to send to everyone
in your address book.

1:20:24.573 --> 1:20:26.340
Your parents.

1:20:26.374 --> 1:20:27.509
Your colleagues.

1:20:27.542 --> 1:20:28.809
All your old buddies
and their wives.

1:20:28.843 --> 1:20:30.344
Cassie, come on.

1:20:33.582 --> 1:20:36.284
So, I can send it out right now,

1:20:36.317 --> 1:20:39.787
or you can tell me where
Al Monroe's bachelor party is.

1:20:41.590 --> 1:20:43.291
What?

1:20:43.324 --> 1:20:44.526
Why?

1:20:44.559 --> 1:20:46.027
You don't need to know why.

1:20:46.060 --> 1:20:47.529
But what are you gonna do?

1:20:47.562 --> 1:20:49.063
Well, that depends.

1:20:49.096 --> 1:20:50.164
On what?

1:20:50.197 --> 1:20:51.566
You think
they'll fire you here?

1:20:51.600 --> 1:20:53.334
- Oh, geez.
- Dr. Ryan Cooper?

1:20:53.367 --> 1:20:54.368
Oh, fuck.

1:20:54.402 --> 1:20:55.469
I mean,
you work with kids, right?

1:20:55.503 --> 1:20:57.905
They have to be careful.
Things have changed so much

1:20:57.938 --> 1:20:59.173
since we were at school,
haven't they?

1:20:59.206 --> 1:21:00.408
Think about this, please.
Please.

1:21:00.441 --> 1:21:05.279
I cannot begin to tell you
how much I've thought about it.

1:21:13.220 --> 1:21:15.323
- Okay.
- Okay.

1:21:23.197 --> 1:21:25.199
All right. There. Okay?

1:21:25.232 --> 1:21:27.301
They're gonna be there
this weekend... all of them.

1:21:27.335 --> 1:21:30.304
You don't... you don't think
I'm a bad person.

1:21:30.338 --> 1:21:32.206
Cassie, I-I...

1:21:32.239 --> 1:21:34.208
I love you.

1:21:34.241 --> 1:21:37.144
I love you, Cassie.

1:21:37.178 --> 1:21:41.349
You got to forgive me.
You got to forgive me.

1:21:41.382 --> 1:21:44.452
Tell me you'll forgive me.

1:21:44.485 --> 1:21:46.320
No.

1:21:49.457 --> 1:21:51.225
So, you're perfect, right?

1:21:51.258 --> 1:21:53.227
You've never done anything
you're ashamed of?

1:21:53.260 --> 1:21:54.962
You're...

1:21:56.263 --> 1:21:58.599
I can't...

1:21:58.632 --> 1:22:00.900
Are you gonna tell everybody?

1:22:02.002 --> 1:22:03.404
I don't know.

1:22:03.437 --> 1:22:04.605
I don't know if I can live with

1:22:04.638 --> 1:22:06.140
the threat of this
hanging over me.

1:22:07.074 --> 1:22:09.510
I didn't even do anything.

1:22:09.543 --> 1:22:11.112
Okay.

1:22:11.145 --> 1:22:14.348
Poor Ryan,
just an innocent bystander.

1:22:15.383 --> 1:22:17.284
Yeah.

1:22:17.318 --> 1:22:20.254
Don't tell any of them
that I'm coming,

1:22:20.287 --> 1:22:23.090
'cause I'll send the video
around just the same if you do.

1:22:23.124 --> 1:22:24.692
And then we both
won't be doctors,

1:22:24.725 --> 1:22:26.327
you fucking failure.

1:22:26.360 --> 1:22:27.561
Nice.

1:22:27.595 --> 1:22:29.896
Bye, Ryan.

1:24:23.376 --> 1:24:25.778
- Oh, shit.
- Holy shit. What?

1:24:25.813 --> 1:24:27.780
Well, the doctor's here.

1:24:38.825 --> 1:24:41.227
Stripper time, baby! Let's go!

1:24:41.261 --> 1:24:44.130
- Let's go!
- Nurse, I'm feeling sick!

1:24:44.163 --> 1:24:45.665
Please take my temperature.

1:24:45.698 --> 1:24:47.534
I told you guys no strippers.

1:24:47.567 --> 1:24:49.135
Anastasia's gonna lose her shit.

1:24:50.370 --> 1:24:52.272
All right, who ordered her?

1:24:52.305 --> 1:24:53.806
- Joe?
- Don't look at me.

1:24:53.840 --> 1:24:56.276
No one's owning up?

1:24:56.309 --> 1:24:58.111
All right, well, when Anastasia
finds out, it's your fucking

1:24:58.144 --> 1:24:59.479
- funeral, you hear me?
- Get out of here.

1:24:59.512 --> 1:25:01.447
I take it you're the groom?

1:25:01.481 --> 1:25:03.149
Yeah.

1:25:04.384 --> 1:25:06.386
Then sit the fuck down.

1:25:06.419 --> 1:25:07.820
Oh, shit!

1:25:07.854 --> 1:25:09.689
Now.

1:25:09.722 --> 1:25:12.825
I'm gonna need you all
to kneel down in front of me

1:25:12.859 --> 1:25:15.128
like the naughty boys you are.

1:25:15.161 --> 1:25:16.829
- Oh...
- Come on, come on.

1:25:18.598 --> 1:25:20.700
Everybody here?

1:25:20.733 --> 1:25:22.468
I don't want anyone to miss out.

1:25:22.502 --> 1:25:25.438
Oh, yeah. All the patients
are accounted for, Nurse.

1:26:13.519 --> 1:26:14.921
Time to go upstairs.

1:26:14.954 --> 1:26:18.858
No, it's okay.
I don't, uh, w-want to.

1:26:18.891 --> 1:26:20.627
Look, I don't
have to do anything

1:26:20.660 --> 1:26:21.894
if you don't want me to,

1:26:21.928 --> 1:26:25.263
but I only get paid
if I go upstairs with you.

1:26:26.264 --> 1:26:29.167
Okay.

1:26:29.201 --> 1:26:31.536
Okay, you guys.

1:26:33.305 --> 1:26:35.908
I better see her crawling
out of here in the morning!

1:26:35.942 --> 1:26:37.877
She better not be able to walk!

1:26:37.910 --> 1:26:39.912
Leave some for us, man!

1:26:43.683 --> 1:26:45.685
Uh, so what do I, uh...

1:26:45.718 --> 1:26:47.619
Get on the bed.

1:26:47.653 --> 1:26:48.855
Okay.

1:26:48.888 --> 1:26:50.322
I'm a little scared of you.

1:26:50.355 --> 1:26:52.759
You don't need to be scared.
Get on the bed.

1:26:52.792 --> 1:26:55.928
All right.

1:26:55.962 --> 1:26:57.797
Oh! Uh, no, no, no. Sorry.

1:26:57.830 --> 1:26:58.865
I-I'm not sure about that.

1:26:58.898 --> 1:27:01.600
It's for my safety.
When I give private dances,

1:27:01.633 --> 1:27:03.735
guys can get
a little handsy, so...

1:27:03.770 --> 1:27:05.637
Oh, right. Yeah, of course.

1:27:08.540 --> 1:27:11.543
You know, you don't...
you don't need to...

1:27:11.576 --> 1:27:12.812
I'm a gentleman.

1:27:12.845 --> 1:27:14.613
- Are you?
- Yeah.

1:27:14.646 --> 1:27:17.582
You might be surprised
to hear that gentlemen

1:27:17.616 --> 1:27:18.951
are sometimes the worst.

1:27:18.985 --> 1:27:20.552
Ow. Oh.

1:27:20.585 --> 1:27:22.754
Sorry, can you, uh...
can you loosen these a little?

1:27:22.788 --> 1:27:25.691
- You'll get used to it.
- Ooh.

1:27:27.559 --> 1:27:29.761
Look, I-I don't want to sound
like a pussy,

1:27:29.795 --> 1:27:33.598
but y-you're not... you're not
gonna do anything, are you?

1:27:34.499 --> 1:27:36.835
It's just... I love my fiancée,

1:27:36.868 --> 1:27:38.403
- and we're getting married.
- Aw.

1:27:38.437 --> 1:27:40.405
So I-I don't want any, uh...

1:27:40.439 --> 1:27:42.841
Hey, do I look like someone
who would make you

1:27:42.874 --> 1:27:44.976
do something
you don't want to do?

1:27:45.011 --> 1:27:47.679
- No.
- Exactly.

1:27:49.481 --> 1:27:51.616
Ay.

1:27:51.650 --> 1:27:53.618
So, what's your name?

1:27:53.652 --> 1:27:54.653
Candy.

1:27:55.887 --> 1:27:58.590
- I mean your real name.
- Nina.

1:27:58.623 --> 1:28:00.225
Nina Fisher.

1:28:01.993 --> 1:28:03.962
What did you say?

1:28:03.995 --> 1:28:06.231
I said my name is Nina Fisher.

1:28:07.065 --> 1:28:08.934
Can you let me go, please?

1:28:08.967 --> 1:28:10.302
I'm sorry, I can't.

1:28:10.335 --> 1:28:11.803
Did one of the guys
put you up to this?

1:28:11.837 --> 1:28:13.338
Was it Joe?

1:28:13.371 --> 1:28:15.807
Jesus Christ, that was dark,
even for him.

1:28:15.841 --> 1:28:16.975
I don't follow.

1:28:17.008 --> 1:28:19.010
- You're not Nina Fisher.
- Why not?

1:28:19.044 --> 1:28:22.013
Because she's dead, okay?

1:28:22.047 --> 1:28:23.482
Must be another Nina Fisher.

1:28:23.515 --> 1:28:24.449
- A coincidence.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

1:28:24.483 --> 1:28:26.351
Hey, can you let me
out of these, please?

1:28:26.384 --> 1:28:27.285
This isn't funny.

1:28:27.319 --> 1:28:29.321
Why would I give you
a dead girl's name?

1:28:29.354 --> 1:28:32.357
Hey, this is fucked up, okay?
Stop.

1:28:32.390 --> 1:28:34.826
But I'm not doing anything.

1:28:34.860 --> 1:28:36.293
Guys! Hey, Joe?

1:28:36.328 --> 1:28:37.496
Br-Brandon, Chip.
Hey, guys.

1:28:37.529 --> 1:28:39.765
Can you get up here, please?

1:28:41.466 --> 1:28:43.435
I don't think they can hear you.

1:28:43.468 --> 1:28:46.905
And even if they could,
they're all passed out by now.

1:28:46.938 --> 1:28:50.341
'Cause if there is one thing
I learned at Forrest,

1:28:50.374 --> 1:28:54.411
it's how easy it is
to slip something into a drink.

1:28:54.446 --> 1:28:56.882
You'd think they'd
remember that, especially Joe.

1:28:59.350 --> 1:29:00.652
Do I know you?

1:29:00.685 --> 1:29:02.788
I'm not sure
you would remember me, Al.

1:29:02.821 --> 1:29:05.490
You were so popular.

1:29:10.028 --> 1:29:12.063
You're Nina's friend.

1:29:12.097 --> 1:29:13.430
Fuck!

1:29:13.464 --> 1:29:14.833
You're Nina's friend.

1:29:14.866 --> 1:29:17.002
So you did notice me after all.

1:29:17.035 --> 1:29:18.536
I'm surprised.

1:29:18.570 --> 1:29:20.504
I wasn't super fuckable
back then,

1:29:20.538 --> 1:29:22.406
so I thought I kind of
slipped your attention.

1:29:22.439 --> 1:29:23.942
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh...
What do you want?

1:29:23.975 --> 1:29:25.610
Money?
You blackmailing me?

1:29:25.644 --> 1:29:29.313
I want you to tell me
what you did.

1:29:30.548 --> 1:29:33.417
Are y...
are you talking about...

1:29:33.450 --> 1:29:34.953
What do you think
I'm talking about?

1:29:34.986 --> 1:29:36.087
I didn't do anything!

1:29:36.121 --> 1:29:37.689
W-We were kids.

1:29:37.722 --> 1:29:39.925
Oh, if I hear that
one more time.

1:29:39.958 --> 1:29:41.425
Look...

1:29:41.458 --> 1:29:42.861
Maybe she regretted it after,
okay?

1:29:42.894 --> 1:29:45.596
- Oh, yeah, she regretted it.
- I didn't do anything!

1:29:45.629 --> 1:29:46.832
- Wrong!
- What the fuck...

1:29:46.865 --> 1:29:48.499
Look, I...

1:29:48.532 --> 1:29:50.734
I don't know what
you want me to say, okay,

1:29:50.769 --> 1:29:52.670
b-b-but we-we did not...

1:29:55.739 --> 1:29:56.942
What?

1:29:56.975 --> 1:29:58.776
You know.

1:30:00.145 --> 1:30:01.445
No.

1:30:01.478 --> 1:30:03.114
She could barely
hold her head up.

1:30:03.148 --> 1:30:04.950
She had no idea
what was going on.

1:30:04.983 --> 1:30:06.151
It was a fucking party.

1:30:06.184 --> 1:30:08.053
I-I mean, yeah, look,
we were all drunk,

1:30:08.086 --> 1:30:09.854
of course,
but-but-but she was into it.

1:30:09.888 --> 1:30:13.357
Didn't look like she was
into it on the video.

1:30:14.692 --> 1:30:15.961
What video?

1:30:15.994 --> 1:30:17.795
Oh, you don't remember?

1:30:17.828 --> 1:30:19.663
Your friend Joe taped it.

1:30:19.697 --> 1:30:22.433
Let me tell you, that party
does not look so good

1:30:22.466 --> 1:30:24.468
in the cold light of day.

1:30:25.502 --> 1:30:29.007
Look, I'll-I'll give you
anything, okay?

1:30:29.040 --> 1:30:30.808
I mean, I'll-I'll do anything.

1:30:30.841 --> 1:30:32.010
Anything.

1:30:32.043 --> 1:30:33.844
Aw. Don't cry.

1:30:33.878 --> 1:30:35.613
Really, don't fucking cry.

1:30:35.646 --> 1:30:37.581
Tell me what you did.

1:30:37.615 --> 1:30:39.016
I didn't do anything wrong,
though!

1:30:39.050 --> 1:30:41.018
She dropped out.

1:30:41.051 --> 1:30:43.888
Top of her class,
and she dropped out.

1:30:43.921 --> 1:30:45.756
I did, too, to take care of her.

1:30:45.789 --> 1:30:47.691
The two of us gone.

1:30:47.725 --> 1:30:49.927
You graduated
magna cum laude, though.

1:30:49.960 --> 1:30:51.629
Did you ever feel guilty,

1:30:51.662 --> 1:30:53.497
or did you just feel relieved
that she'd gone?

1:30:53.530 --> 1:30:55.032
You know, I was affected
by it, too, okay?

1:30:55.065 --> 1:30:56.467
I mean, it's every guy's
worst nightmare,

1:30:56.500 --> 1:30:57.568
getting accused like that.

1:30:57.601 --> 1:31:01.538
Can you guess what every woman's
worst nightmare is?

1:31:03.941 --> 1:31:06.977
The thing is you thought
you'd gotten away with it

1:31:07.011 --> 1:31:08.646
because everyone had forgotten.

1:31:08.679 --> 1:31:11.148
- Fuck.
- But I haven't.

1:31:11.181 --> 1:31:14.652
You're out of your fucking mind!

1:31:14.685 --> 1:31:17.221
I was so sad to leave, you know?

1:31:17.254 --> 1:31:20.491
I wanted to be a doctor
my whole life.

1:31:20.524 --> 1:31:23.193
But lately,
I've been feeling like...

1:31:23.227 --> 1:31:25.429
I might want to get
back into it.

1:31:26.096 --> 1:31:27.631
Stop.

1:31:27.665 --> 1:31:29.867
- You know...
- Please. Please stop. Hey.

1:31:29.900 --> 1:31:31.201
Nina was extraordinary.

1:31:31.235 --> 1:31:32.670
So smart.

1:31:32.703 --> 1:31:34.204
Help!

1:31:34.238 --> 1:31:35.539
Weirdly smart.

1:31:35.572 --> 1:31:37.741
Help! Help me!

1:31:37.775 --> 1:31:38.676
Fuck!

1:31:38.709 --> 1:31:40.811
Help me!

1:31:40.844 --> 1:31:43.013
I want you to know
what she was like, okay?

1:31:43.047 --> 1:31:44.214
Come on.

1:31:44.248 --> 1:31:45.683
She's just so difficult
to explain,

1:31:45.716 --> 1:31:47.251
'cause she was just
so completely herself.

1:31:47.284 --> 1:31:50.453
Even when she was
four years old.

1:31:51.855 --> 1:31:55.259
She was fully formed
from day one.

1:31:55.292 --> 1:31:59.129
Same face. Same walk.

1:31:59.163 --> 1:32:01.098
And funny.

1:32:01.131 --> 1:32:02.498
Like a grown-up is funny.

1:32:02.532 --> 1:32:04.868
Kind of shrewd.

1:32:05.736 --> 1:32:07.805
I was just in awe of her.

1:32:07.838 --> 1:32:10.274
I couldn't believe
she wanted to be my friend.

1:32:10.307 --> 1:32:13.277
She didn't give a fuck
what anyone else thought,

1:32:13.310 --> 1:32:17.147
apart from me,
'cause she was just...

1:32:17.181 --> 1:32:19.582
Nina.

1:32:22.052 --> 1:32:24.587
And then she wasn't.

1:32:25.756 --> 1:32:28.292
Suddenly,
she was something else.

1:32:28.325 --> 1:32:29.960
She was yours.

1:32:31.195 --> 1:32:34.564
It wasn't her name she heard
when she was walking around.

1:32:34.597 --> 1:32:36.566
It was yours.

1:32:36.599 --> 1:32:40.270
Your name all around her.

1:32:40.304 --> 1:32:43.240
All over her all the time.

1:32:43.273 --> 1:32:45.641
And it just...

1:32:47.710 --> 1:32:49.880
...squeezed her out.

1:32:52.682 --> 1:32:55.319
So, when I heard
your name again...

1:32:55.352 --> 1:32:59.622
your filthy fucking name...

1:32:59.655 --> 1:33:04.328
I wondered, when was the last
time anyone had said hers?

1:33:04.361 --> 1:33:06.263
Or thought it, even?

1:33:06.296 --> 1:33:08.298
Apart from me.

1:33:08.332 --> 1:33:12.835
And it made me so sad
because, Al...

1:33:12.869 --> 1:33:17.840
you should be the one
with her name all over you.

1:33:18.841 --> 1:33:21.045
No. No.

1:33:21.078 --> 1:33:22.945
Don't worry.
I've sterilized everything.

1:33:22.979 --> 1:33:24.914
- No.
- I really would have been a great doctor.

1:33:24.947 --> 1:33:26.582
- You're insane.
- You know what?

1:33:26.616 --> 1:33:28.185
I honestly don't think I am.

1:33:28.218 --> 1:33:29.919
I'll do this
as quick as I can, okay?

1:33:32.189 --> 1:33:34.158
Stop. Stop!

1:33:34.191 --> 1:33:35.625
- Get off me!
- No!

1:33:35.658 --> 1:33:37.660
Just stop fucking moving!

1:33:37.693 --> 1:33:40.230
- Just stop, please! Fucking...
- No!

1:33:40.264 --> 1:33:41.631
You...

1:33:53.843 --> 1:33:54.877
No!

1:33:54.911 --> 1:33:57.080
Fuck!

1:34:23.139 --> 1:34:26.175
Stop. Stop.

1:34:26.209 --> 1:34:27.977
Shit. Shit.

1:34:34.450 --> 1:34:37.386
This is your fucking fault!

1:34:46.329 --> 1:34:48.064
Fuck it.

1:34:54.170 --> 1:34:56.405
Stop. Stop. Stop!

1:35:00.176 --> 1:35:03.146
Fucking stop fucking moving!

1:35:03.179 --> 1:35:05.281
Stop fucking moving!

1:35:17.460 --> 1:35:19.028
Stop.

1:37:08.471 --> 1:37:10.406
Whoa.

1:37:10.439 --> 1:37:12.374
What a night.

1:37:12.408 --> 1:37:13.875
Ooh.

1:37:13.908 --> 1:37:15.277
The fucking nurse?

1:37:15.310 --> 1:37:17.546
Are you kidding me?

1:37:17.580 --> 1:37:19.482
Nice.

1:37:19.515 --> 1:37:21.283
Joe.

1:37:21.316 --> 1:37:23.519
Al, Al, please don't freak out,
all right?

1:37:23.552 --> 1:37:25.153
Anastasia's never
gonna find out.

1:37:25.186 --> 1:37:28.790
What happens on tour
stays on tour.

1:37:29.424 --> 1:37:31.293
She's dead, Joe.

1:37:32.327 --> 1:37:33.395
Come on.

1:37:34.462 --> 1:37:35.564
I'm not kidding.

1:37:39.100 --> 1:37:42.037
All right, I got...
y-you're being ironic.

1:37:42.070 --> 1:37:43.104
What?

1:37:43.138 --> 1:37:45.407
You killed the stripper
at your bachelor party?

1:37:45.440 --> 1:37:47.175
What is this, the '90s?

1:37:47.208 --> 1:37:49.077
Al, classic.

1:37:49.110 --> 1:37:51.479
Come on.
You want me to get her

1:37:51.513 --> 1:37:53.281
out of here
so you can get some sleep?

1:37:53.315 --> 1:37:54.582
All right.

1:37:54.616 --> 1:37:57.319
All right, honey,
time for you to go.

1:37:57.352 --> 1:37:59.287
Come on.

1:38:01.656 --> 1:38:03.625
What is she doing?

1:38:03.658 --> 1:38:05.327
Hey, honey, come on.

1:38:05.360 --> 1:38:06.961
We got to go.

1:38:07.962 --> 1:38:09.864
Honey, what are we doing...

1:38:09.898 --> 1:38:11.599
Jesus fucking Chr...

1:38:11.633 --> 1:38:14.069
Fuck. Is she dead?

1:38:16.971 --> 1:38:18.540
Al, why is
the fucking stripper dead?

1:38:18.573 --> 1:38:20.041
I told you.

1:38:20.075 --> 1:38:21.443
Well, how did this happen?

1:38:21.476 --> 1:38:23.211
I don't know.

1:38:30.285 --> 1:38:31.653
Okay. Hey.

1:38:31.686 --> 1:38:34.923
Al, this is not your fault.

1:38:34.956 --> 1:38:36.491
I don't know.
It kind of seems like it is.

1:38:36.524 --> 1:38:38.593
No, no, no, no.

1:38:38.626 --> 1:38:40.894
It's not. It's not.

1:38:40.928 --> 1:38:42.997
Am-am-am I...

1:38:43.031 --> 1:38:45.233
- Am I gonna go to jail?
- What?

1:38:45.266 --> 1:38:48.103
- What about the wedding and-and my job?
- No.

1:38:48.136 --> 1:38:51.172
Anastasia's gonna be
so upset with me.

1:38:51.206 --> 1:38:52.140
Well, no, no.

1:38:52.173 --> 1:38:54.542
Al, Al, Al, Al,
it was an accident, right?

1:38:54.576 --> 1:38:56.478
I mean...

1:38:56.511 --> 1:38:57.978
Hey!

1:38:58.011 --> 1:38:58.946
It was an accident.

1:38:58.979 --> 1:39:00.914
I mean, of course it was
a fucking accident.

1:39:00.948 --> 1:39:02.517
Yeah, of course
it was a fucking accident.

1:39:02.550 --> 1:39:03.651
No one's gonna go to jail,

1:39:03.685 --> 1:39:05.653
because no one's ever
gonna find out.

1:39:05.687 --> 1:39:08.656
If anybody asks,
we all saw her leave last night.

1:39:08.690 --> 1:39:12.059
She stripped, and then she left.

1:39:13.026 --> 1:39:15.663
- She left?
- She left.

1:39:15.697 --> 1:39:17.532
Okay. All right.

1:39:17.565 --> 1:39:20.535
It's gonna be fine, all right?

1:39:20.568 --> 1:39:23.538
We're gonna take care of this.

1:39:23.571 --> 1:39:25.340
We just got to get rid
of the body

1:39:25.373 --> 1:39:26.708
before the others leave.

1:39:26.741 --> 1:39:28.343
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:39:28.376 --> 1:39:29.611
It's okay. Look at me.

1:39:29.644 --> 1:39:31.312
This is not your fault, Al.

1:39:31.346 --> 1:39:33.448
- Thank you.
- You did nothing wrong.

1:39:33.481 --> 1:39:35.417
All right. All right.

1:39:35.450 --> 1:39:37.652
You did nothing wrong.

1:39:37.685 --> 1:39:39.421
This is not your fault.

1:39:39.454 --> 1:39:41.356
Can you uncuff me?

1:39:42.624 --> 1:39:45.292
Okay, come here. Come here.

1:40:53.627 --> 1:40:54.829
<i>Can't you just</i>

1:40:54.863 --> 1:40:58.332
do that thing where you track
her cell phone or something?

1:40:58.365 --> 1:40:59.633
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1:40:59.666 --> 1:41:02.336
It was turned off
before she left.

1:41:02.369 --> 1:41:04.505
Seems like she really
didn't want anyone

1:41:04.538 --> 1:41:06.273
to know where she was.

1:41:06.306 --> 1:41:08.208
But it-it's...

1:41:08.242 --> 1:41:10.244
it's just not like her
to disappear like this.

1:41:10.277 --> 1:41:12.412
Well, that's not
entirely true, honey.

1:41:12.446 --> 1:41:14.248
Stanley.

1:41:14.281 --> 1:41:17.818
I... You know, she's...

1:41:17.851 --> 1:41:20.053
she was getting better.

1:41:20.087 --> 1:41:21.588
She was, really.

1:41:21.622 --> 1:41:23.657
- She was getting better.
- Yes, she was.

1:41:23.690 --> 1:41:25.626
She... Of course she was.

1:41:25.659 --> 1:41:27.728
She'll come back.

1:41:27.761 --> 1:41:29.530
You know how she is.

1:41:29.563 --> 1:41:31.164
She always comes back.

1:41:31.198 --> 1:41:32.799
Was she seeing anyone?

1:41:32.833 --> 1:41:35.135
Did she have a boyfriend?

1:41:36.670 --> 1:41:37.804
Yes.

1:41:37.838 --> 1:41:39.840
Are you Dr. Cooper?

1:41:39.873 --> 1:41:41.375
Yeah.

1:41:41.408 --> 1:41:43.577
Detective Waller.

1:41:45.579 --> 1:41:49.048
Yeah. Uh, come in, please.

1:41:51.385 --> 1:41:52.753
Have a seat.

1:41:52.786 --> 1:41:54.555
Pediatric surgeon, huh?

1:41:54.588 --> 1:41:55.789
Yeah.

1:41:55.822 --> 1:41:57.391
That's very commendable.

1:41:57.424 --> 1:42:00.460
Thank you for all that you do
for the community.

1:42:00.494 --> 1:42:02.128
Sure. Yeah.

1:42:02.162 --> 1:42:05.097
I'm sorry to bother you
at work, Doctor.

1:42:05.131 --> 1:42:07.634
Do you know a Cassandra Thomas?

1:42:09.369 --> 1:42:10.771
Yeah. Yes.

1:42:10.804 --> 1:42:12.104
Yes.

1:42:12.138 --> 1:42:14.274
- How do you know her?
- We were...

1:42:15.742 --> 1:42:18.177
We were seeing each other.

1:42:18.210 --> 1:42:20.179
Were seeing each other?

1:42:20.212 --> 1:42:22.716
We broke up a few days ago.

1:42:22.749 --> 1:42:24.585
Define "a few days."

1:42:25.619 --> 1:42:26.853
Last Thursday.

1:42:26.887 --> 1:42:30.189
Have you had any contact since?

1:42:30.222 --> 1:42:32.492
No. I'm sorry,
what is this regarding?

1:42:32.526 --> 1:42:35.829
Cassandra's parents have filed
a missing persons report.

1:42:35.862 --> 1:42:37.598
I'm sorry, what?

1:42:37.631 --> 1:42:38.832
Why?

1:42:38.865 --> 1:42:41.568
Because she's missing.

1:42:41.602 --> 1:42:44.136
Since when?

1:42:44.170 --> 1:42:45.505
Since Friday.

1:42:45.539 --> 1:42:47.641
She told her parents
something about a work trip,

1:42:47.674 --> 1:42:49.910
but her colleague didn't know
anything about it.

1:42:49.943 --> 1:42:52.244
Do you have any idea
where she might have been

1:42:52.278 --> 1:42:54.413
going to this weekend?

1:42:56.750 --> 1:42:59.653
She mentioned, uh,
the work trip.

1:42:59.686 --> 1:43:02.221
- Yeah.
- Any idea where?

1:43:04.256 --> 1:43:07.594
N-No. No.

1:43:07.628 --> 1:43:10.262
I'm sorry.

1:43:10.296 --> 1:43:11.932
That's all right, Doc.

1:43:11.965 --> 1:43:13.900
Between you and me, it, uh,

1:43:13.934 --> 1:43:16.569
sounded like she wasn't
feeling so good.

1:43:16.603 --> 1:43:18.204
Mentally, I mean.

1:43:18.237 --> 1:43:21.540
Her father seemed to think
she was a little unstable.

1:43:23.275 --> 1:43:25.846
Yeah, she was...

1:43:25.879 --> 1:43:29.348
not in a good place.

1:43:31.350 --> 1:43:35.287
Do you think she might have
wanted to hurt herself?

1:43:39.458 --> 1:43:40.626
Yeah.

1:43:40.660 --> 1:43:43.262
Uh, she could've.

1:43:43.295 --> 1:43:45.364
She could've, yeah.

1:43:45.398 --> 1:43:48.267
I thought that might
be the case.

1:43:48.300 --> 1:43:50.469
Thank you for your honesty.

1:43:50.503 --> 1:43:52.371
Well, I don't want
to bother you anymore,

1:43:52.405 --> 1:43:54.440
but if you wouldn't mind coming
to the station tomorrow,

1:43:54.473 --> 1:43:55.842
you know,
for an official statement.

1:43:55.876 --> 1:43:57.844
Of course.
Anything I can do to help.

1:43:57.878 --> 1:43:59.245
Thank you for your time,
Doctor.

1:43:59.278 --> 1:44:01.313
- Appreciate it.
- Thank you.

1:44:01.347 --> 1:44:02.848
That's cute.

1:44:02.883 --> 1:44:05.418
Yeah.

1:44:18.731 --> 1:44:22.501
Anastasia, you're the greatest
thing that ever happened to me.

1:44:22.535 --> 1:44:25.604
You are my moral compass
and the love of my life.

1:44:25.638 --> 1:44:28.307
Al, you are my best friend

1:44:28.340 --> 1:44:30.476
and my soul mate.

1:44:30.509 --> 1:44:31.944
I love you.

1:44:31.977 --> 1:44:33.479
Al's like a brother to me.

1:44:33.512 --> 1:44:34.914
We grew up together. We're...

1:44:34.947 --> 1:44:36.248
We're the best of friends.

1:44:36.282 --> 1:44:37.550
We've been through
thick and thin.

1:44:37.583 --> 1:44:40.586
And-and I just love him.

1:44:40.619 --> 1:44:43.422
And, you know,
he's met Anastasia, who,

1:44:43.456 --> 1:44:46.726
by all accounts, is,
you know, just a solid catch.

1:44:54.533 --> 1:44:55.835
That's great.

1:44:58.437 --> 1:45:00.873
- How you doing, man?
- Hey.

1:45:00.906 --> 1:45:03.409
See that bridesmaid over there?

1:45:03.442 --> 1:45:05.411
Whew. Just the type of girl
that makes you

1:45:05.444 --> 1:45:07.713
go home to your wife
and say...

1:45:07.747 --> 1:45:10.349
You know she trained
at Cirque du Soleil?

1:45:10.382 --> 1:45:13.018
Come on her ass and her face
at the same time.

1:45:13.052 --> 1:45:15.020
- That's nice.
- Unbelievable.

1:45:15.054 --> 1:45:16.388
- Everything just turned out so nice.
- Yeah.

1:45:16.422 --> 1:45:17.423
It's good seeing you.

1:45:17.456 --> 1:45:19.625
Good. Yeah, you, too.

1:45:21.527 --> 1:45:23.362
- Hi. How are you?
- Oh, hey, Joe. - Hey.

1:45:23.395 --> 1:45:24.864
- Hey, it's good to see you.
- Good speech.

1:45:24.897 --> 1:45:27.500
- I'm going to get a drink.
- Cheers.

1:47:51.209 --> 1:47:53.511
- You're Alexander Monroe?
- Uh, yeah.

1:47:53.544 --> 1:47:54.913
You're under arrest
for the murder

1:47:54.946 --> 1:47:56.648
- of Cassandra Thomas.
- No, no, no, no.

1:47:56.681 --> 1:47:57.649
Officer,
please remove the bride.

1:47:57.682 --> 1:47:58.716
I'm sorry, this is a mistake.

1:47:58.750 --> 1:48:00.818
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Excuse me!

1:48:00.852 --> 1:48:03.121
Can you explain
what's going on? Al!

1:48:05.857 --> 1:48:07.125
- Sir...
- Hey, hey!

1:48:08.559 --> 1:48:09.994
You have the right
to an attorney.

1:48:10.028 --> 1:48:12.530
If you can't afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

1:48:12.563 --> 1:48:13.932
- Understand, sir?
- Yes.

1:48:13.965 --> 1:48:16.834
Officer, show him to the car.
