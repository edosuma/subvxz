WEBVTT

00:05.273 --> 00:10.810
My great fear is a
fear of failing.

00:10.811 --> 00:12.312
And that's Hawaiian because I

00:12.313 --> 00:15.115
was born that way because
that's expectation.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.650
You're Hawaiian, you're
going to be less.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.386
You're Hawaiian, you're
going to feel more.

00:19.387 --> 00:19.887
It's old.

00:19.887 --> 00:20.221
It's in you.

00:20.222 --> 00:21.689
It's part of your identity.

00:25.926 --> 00:29.462
But when I navigate a voyage, I

00:29.463 --> 00:30.630
know when the storm comes, it's

00:30.631 --> 00:35.001
going to take you to the bone.

00:35.002 --> 00:38.738
And if the storm keeps coming,
you've got to stand up.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.740
That's just what
you've got to do.

00:40.741 --> 00:43.410
It's this zone where you learn
to make fear your best friend.

00:43.411 --> 00:47.414
You hold it really close to you
and you open up the door to

00:47.415 --> 00:49.217
believing that you can make it.

01:38.966 --> 01:41.468
Hawaii is America.

01:41.469 --> 01:46.306
As American as anything
could possibly be.

01:46.307 --> 01:49.342
Yet also never shed what was
there before in the layers and

01:49.343 --> 01:52.512
layers that have come since.

01:52.513 --> 01:58.551
It's a wonderful tricky
conflicted mutant in lack of a

01:58.552 --> 02:01.421
better word you'd have
to call paradise.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.856
No man's paradise.

02:03.857 --> 02:06.426
Paradises don't exist.

02:06.427 --> 02:07.927
Paradise is kind
of in your head.

02:07.928 --> 02:08.428
Wait a minute.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.862
You look at your window here.

02:09.863 --> 02:12.832
You look at those hills, those

02:12.833 --> 02:18.838
mountains, all that
green, that blue sky.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.240
The clear sea.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.675
It sure looks like
paradise to me.

02:22.676 --> 02:23.743
This guy knows.

02:23.744 --> 02:27.547
He's been everywhere.

02:27.548 --> 02:30.583
He's Paul Theru.

02:30.584 --> 02:33.019
He's a legendary travel writer.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.354
Of the all the places he's been,

02:34.355 --> 02:37.757
all the places he's seen, he
chose Hawaii to live and he's

02:37.758 --> 02:41.194
lived here for 25 years.

02:41.195 --> 02:43.129
Does it matter
that it's America?

02:43.130 --> 02:45.265
It's the big thing
that it's America.

02:45.266 --> 02:48.701
It has elements of
the third world.

02:48.702 --> 02:51.738
The nicest elements of the third

02:51.739 --> 02:54.307
world which is the
self-respect, the pride.

02:54.308 --> 02:57.043
Things that don't work at all.

02:57.044 --> 02:58.878
And then it's USA.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.547
Where we are now.

03:00.548 --> 03:01.814
There's PTA meetings here.

03:01.815 --> 03:07.420
They get together and watch the
super bowl and it's the most

03:07.421 --> 03:15.061
main street USA you will find.

03:15.062 --> 03:18.765
Town is a neighborhood spot in
the district and as Hawaii is

03:18.766 --> 03:23.270
the only state in the union that
allows fishermen to sell to

03:23.271 --> 03:27.574
restaurants, the pan-roasted
mahi-mahi is pretty damn good.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.942
It's not a particularly
welcoming or friendly part of

03:29.943 --> 03:31.411
the world.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.513
Contrary to the sort
of the aloha myth.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.248
No, that's right.

03:35.249 --> 03:37.417
But no island is.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.251
Nantucket isn't.

03:38.252 --> 03:40.953
The island of Hawaii isn't.

03:40.954 --> 03:48.954
An island that, want
foreigners there?

03:51.665 --> 03:52.432
Sicily.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.434
Did anyone come to an island
with a good intention?

03:54.435 --> 03:59.339
No, never in this new world.

03:59.340 --> 04:02.342
Best case in the world,
bring syphilis.

04:02.343 --> 04:02.643
Pretty much.

04:02.643 --> 04:03.043
At the very least.

04:03.043 --> 04:03.444
Yes.

04:03.445 --> 04:06.145
Captain cook put his sailors

04:06.146 --> 04:10.883
ashore just to look
northwest of here.

04:10.884 --> 04:11.851
The first.

04:11.852 --> 04:14.120
Hawaii killed its first tourist.

04:14.121 --> 04:18.458
Philippines killed their first
tourist but people on the

04:18.459 --> 04:19.726
islands born on the islands.

04:19.726 --> 04:21.380
View anyone who comes
ashore with suspicion.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.636
What defines a Hawaiian?

04:29.637 --> 04:33.906
Maybe should go back in our
imaginations to could have been

04:33.907 --> 04:34.574
2,000 years ago.

04:34.575 --> 04:37.910
The Tahitians had this voyage

04:37.911 --> 04:44.484
way before any other culture
was exploring the deep seas.

04:44.485 --> 04:45.818
Somehow, someplace in the south

04:45.819 --> 04:53.760
pacific, single most
isolated in the planet.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.428
Fast forward to captain cook and

04:55.429 --> 05:00.900
get a glimpse, very
productive people.

05:00.901 --> 05:01.834
They're industrious, healthy.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.370
For the arts.

05:03.371 --> 05:06.005
That was a large population,
more than half of what we have

05:06.006 --> 05:07.273
in Hawaii today.

05:07.274 --> 05:09.542
Fully sustainable, because
there was no other choice.

05:09.543 --> 05:14.080
So over time, the native
Hawaiian population goes to

05:14.081 --> 05:14.348
22,000.

05:14.349 --> 05:18.184
It's the same story.

05:18.185 --> 05:22.288
Introduced, the inability to
deal with it, people die.

05:22.289 --> 05:25.191
1926, public school system would

05:25.192 --> 05:27.394
outlaw language and the practice

05:27.395 --> 05:29.729
of culture in public schools.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.064
So extinctions well paid.

05:34.435 --> 05:39.105
Between captain cook's
arrival in 1778 and today,

05:39.106 --> 05:41.641
disease wiped out most
of the population.

05:41.642 --> 05:42.241
Missionaries came.

05:42.242 --> 05:46.913
A booming sugar and pineapple
plantation industry.

05:46.914 --> 05:50.817
Influx of immigrants in Okinawa,

05:50.818 --> 05:53.553
China, and the Philippines,
the overthrow.

05:53.554 --> 05:56.956
And the U.S. takeover of
the Hawaiian government.

05:56.957 --> 05:57.957
World war ii.

05:57.958 --> 06:01.194
And finally, statehood.

06:07.901 --> 06:11.303
The geographical realities of
being thousands of miles from,

06:11.304 --> 06:14.641
well, anywhere else, has
given Hawaii to some degree,

06:14.642 --> 06:16.409
protection from the forces that

06:16.410 --> 06:20.680
eradicated so many other south
pacific cultures entirely.

06:20.681 --> 06:24.917
In fact, they've arguably been
holding back the inevitable

06:24.918 --> 06:26.386
better than just about anyone.

06:30.491 --> 06:33.426
What Hawaii looks like today
depends which island you're

06:33.427 --> 06:34.961
standing on and to some extent,

06:34.962 --> 06:37.096
the reputation of the locals.

06:37.097 --> 06:42.301
The Hawaiian islands
are not a monolith.

06:42.302 --> 06:44.003
Islands, that's plural and we're

06:44.004 --> 06:48.775
talking eight very different
islands with very different

06:48.776 --> 06:49.109
identities.

06:49.110 --> 06:53.279
It's been over a century since
the waves of immigrants began

06:53.280 --> 06:56.182
and things got all mixed up
in the best possible way.

06:56.183 --> 06:57.016
There's layers.

06:57.017 --> 07:00.553
And a simple question like, who

07:00.554 --> 07:04.791
is Hawaiian gets you
all kinds of answers.

07:04.792 --> 07:08.728
The neighborhood of Kalihi is

07:08.729 --> 07:11.531
far from what most know and most

07:11.532 --> 07:13.533
specific kind the last 40 years.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.234
It's the blue collar town.

07:15.235 --> 07:17.236
They all come here.

07:17.237 --> 07:18.370
Breakfast, lunch.

07:18.371 --> 07:18.971
Every day.

07:18.972 --> 07:25.512
I'm joined by two local chefs,
Mark Maguchi of mission,

07:25.513 --> 07:27.680
known by some as the gooch.

07:27.681 --> 07:30.817
Second generation
Japanese and Andrew.

07:30.818 --> 07:33.920
He's first generation Vietnamese
American or would that be

07:33.921 --> 07:34.721
Vietnamese Hawaiian?

07:34.722 --> 07:37.724
As you'll see, it
gets complicated.

07:37.725 --> 07:39.158
I actually cooked on the east

07:39.159 --> 07:40.392
coast for three years and people

07:40.393 --> 07:43.062
would always be like,
are you from Hawaii?

07:43.063 --> 07:43.830
You're Hawaiian?

07:43.831 --> 07:48.735
I said, no.

07:48.736 --> 07:49.002
Japanese.

07:49.003 --> 07:50.436
But Hawaiian?

07:50.437 --> 07:55.742
No, I realized like, here in
Hawaii, we identify ourselves

07:55.743 --> 07:58.210
ethnically versus
geographically.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.513
No way we would call
ourselves Hawaiians.

08:00.514 --> 08:06.919
We would get our asses
kicked by a Hawaiian.

08:06.920 --> 08:07.854
Who is Hawaiian?

08:07.855 --> 08:09.856
A native of the land.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.057
In your blood.

08:11.058 --> 08:14.594
You come from a lineage of
native Hawaiian people.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.762
What's here?

08:15.763 --> 08:20.600
I feel like Hawaiian
in a sense, you know.

08:20.601 --> 08:21.601
It's my place.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.435
But culturally, that's
a different story.

08:23.436 --> 08:25.037
You say you're not Hawaiian.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.205
No.

08:26.206 --> 08:32.378
What's your feeling about
so you're Hawaiian.

08:32.379 --> 08:40.379
I'm born and raised,
going to die 808.

08:41.922 --> 08:49.729
Aka mob, mainly Japanese
husband, and daughter, who I

08:49.730 --> 08:54.433
guess would be Japanese,
Okinawan/Hawaiian and

08:54.434 --> 09:00.339
son-in-law, Robert, who
is of course, Mexican.

09:00.340 --> 09:00.741
That's pretty.

09:00.742 --> 09:03.075
Ooh, look at that.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.946
That looks good.

09:09.116 --> 09:12.852
Now we are talking.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.520
That's awesome.

09:14.521 --> 09:18.791
I just caught local food.

09:18.792 --> 09:23.262
When I look at this
table, it's just Hawaii.

09:23.263 --> 09:27.366
Got Portuguese, Japanese.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.602
Okinawa Okinawan, world war ii.

09:29.603 --> 09:29.937
I don't know.

09:29.938 --> 09:30.937
Korea?

09:30.938 --> 09:37.443
Korean, Japanese, Hawaiian.

09:37.444 --> 09:37.778
Awesomeness.

09:37.779 --> 09:41.180
The food is bone deep Hawaiian
stuff, which is to say

09:41.181 --> 09:42.682
delicious mash-up, okay.

09:42.683 --> 09:43.850
Take taco rice.

09:43.851 --> 09:51.851
It's a dish created in Okinawa
to approximate Tex-Mex

09:52.225 --> 09:58.297
appropriated by younger
generations of Okinawan and

09:58.298 --> 10:00.633
Japanese found its
way back to Hawaii.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.368
Got that?

10:02.369 --> 10:05.471
Identify, my best friends
were native Hawaiian.

10:05.472 --> 10:09.909
Helped me to realize the
pride of being from Hawaii,

10:09.910 --> 10:11.577
understanding the
Hawaiian culture.

10:11.578 --> 10:13.145
Living it.

10:13.146 --> 10:13.913
Possibly Japanese.

10:13.914 --> 10:17.684
There's still a
movement to sovereign.

10:17.685 --> 10:19.819
There's strong movement.

10:19.820 --> 10:24.657
So if fighting broke out,
which side are you on?

10:24.658 --> 10:27.860
You don't have to
think about that.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.762
I would joke about it.

10:29.763 --> 10:32.699
If like, me and Hawaii.

10:32.700 --> 10:36.335
I am back and uncle Sam and were

10:36.336 --> 10:38.838
like, no, native Hawaiian only,
I'm like, everybody needs to

10:38.839 --> 10:39.039
cook.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.172
I'm a cook.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.141
I have worth!

10:48.916 --> 10:52.719
This is Ninoa Thompson.

10:52.720 --> 11:00.720
In 1976 with similarly heroic
Hawaiians, he did a difficult

11:00.861 --> 11:02.361
important thing.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.931
Before 1972, it was generally

11:04.932 --> 11:08.367
assumed even insisted upon
that Hawaii had been settled

11:08.368 --> 11:12.204
originally by some random
savages who maybe drifted over

11:12.205 --> 11:20.205
accidentally from south America.

11:25.618 --> 11:28.387
Couldn't have been ancient
Polynesians across thousands of

11:28.388 --> 11:31.623
miles of open water.

11:31.624 --> 11:32.491
No dreams.

11:32.492 --> 11:33.625
No hope.

11:33.626 --> 11:34.306
Can't see.

11:40.901 --> 11:44.971
They were set out to prove
that's what did happen.

11:44.972 --> 11:48.440
There were those in the
community that loved this,

11:48.441 --> 11:55.748
prayed for it.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.316
It was powerful.

11:57.317 --> 12:01.420
It changed everything.

12:01.421 --> 12:06.125
The hokulaia.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.426
A kind of craft believed to have

12:07.427 --> 12:13.265
been used in those times
and only using primitive

12:13.266 --> 12:14.967
contemporaneous navigational

12:14.968 --> 12:17.203
tools sailed to Tahiti and back.

12:17.204 --> 12:22.108
The trip that helped spark a
Hawaiian renaissance, a rebirth

12:22.109 --> 12:24.877
of pride and interest in
traditional Hawaiian culture and

12:24.878 --> 12:25.145
identity.

12:25.146 --> 12:33.146
The success was monumental.

12:37.524 --> 12:40.292
Changed the view of ancestors as

12:40.293 --> 12:45.798
extraordinarily skilled
and so we come from them.

12:45.799 --> 12:49.001
Thomas is a water man
who continues to sail.

12:49.002 --> 12:52.371
Native Hawaii, his roots go
back in the valley 200 years.

12:52.372 --> 12:55.507
My grandfather was born here.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.392
So I grew up.

13:02.816 --> 13:06.552
Spent many years learning
techniques from a master.

13:06.553 --> 13:13.492
Now the small
Micronesian island.

13:13.493 --> 13:17.163
He was put to be trained and
learning the wind and the water

13:17.164 --> 13:25.164
and the zone, he was sailing.

13:28.041 --> 13:31.710
The canoe make me sick, my
grandfather threw me into the

13:31.711 --> 13:32.945
ocean to go inside the wave.

13:32.946 --> 13:36.382
When I go inside the
wave, I become the wave.

13:36.383 --> 13:39.919
When I become the
wave, now I navigate.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.420
I approached him.

13:41.421 --> 13:44.023
Said to me, too old?

13:44.024 --> 13:48.360
You want someone to
know everything.

13:48.361 --> 13:49.695
Send his son.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.530
He said I'll teach you enough to

13:51.531 --> 13:57.970
find the island you seek, but
I can't teach you the magic.

13:57.971 --> 14:04.043
Why do you think it was
important to do such a thing?

14:04.044 --> 14:08.247
The same story you'll see
everywhere in terms of the

14:08.248 --> 14:08.881
indigenous people.

14:08.882 --> 14:11.650
My father's mother, nearly pure

14:11.651 --> 14:14.153
Hawaiian, chooses not to teach

14:14.154 --> 14:17.223
her children language or
culture or genealogy.

14:17.224 --> 14:18.224
Where do you come?

14:18.225 --> 14:19.758
Who's your family?

14:19.759 --> 14:23.562
What's your name, and that could
have been 100 generations.

14:23.563 --> 14:26.298
What the voyage did was a
reconnection back to feeling

14:26.299 --> 14:31.470
wholesome about who you are,
because knowing where you come

14:31.471 --> 14:39.471
from and who are your ancestors.

14:39.947 --> 14:40.980
This this wasn't.

14:40.981 --> 14:43.582
It was symbolic.

14:43.583 --> 14:44.816
A bumper sticker,
t-shirt emerged.

14:44.817 --> 14:48.922
I'm proud to be Hawaiian.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.289
1987, first language.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.857
Mandatory in schools.

14:51.858 --> 14:52.992
Has to be taught.

14:52.993 --> 14:56.128
Private schools won't have
attendance if you don't teach

14:56.129 --> 14:56.695
Hawaiian.

14:56.696 --> 14:58.430
Now Hawaiian identity
into everything.

14:58.431 --> 15:02.302
It has to be recognized
in everything.

15:09.509 --> 15:10.476
That is powerful.

15:10.477 --> 15:18.477
What I mentioned to people, is
in Ooahu, that I was going

15:19.552 --> 15:25.824
Moliki, a lot were surprised.

15:25.825 --> 15:28.827
They said the Malachi dudes were

15:28.828 --> 15:33.799
mean, unfriendly, tough as iron
and quick to get pissed off.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.602
As it turned out, that
was not my experience.

15:43.476 --> 15:47.046
We like to brag that we
don't have traffic lights.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.147
We only have traffic.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.248
Nice.

15:49.249 --> 15:54.086
Walter Naki is a skilled
fisherman and today, we head out

15:54.087 --> 16:00.892
for some octopus.

16:00.893 --> 16:05.031
It's not the friendly island.

16:05.032 --> 16:07.533
Supposed to be the most
unfriendly island.

16:07.534 --> 16:12.571
Traditionally, we're
here very freely.

16:12.572 --> 16:20.572
Now, unfreely is where you
go try to come and fix it.

16:21.114 --> 16:29.114
That's when it
becomes unfriendly.

16:30.623 --> 16:32.191
We had a lot still in tact.

16:32.192 --> 16:32.724
Still?

16:32.725 --> 16:34.760
Yes.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.695
But there is always other
people that want to come.

16:36.696 --> 16:40.432
Unsurprisingly, fishing rights
is an issue around here.

16:40.433 --> 16:43.069
Don't come over here sport
fishing the wrong place if you

16:43.070 --> 16:48.240
know what's good for you.

16:48.241 --> 16:52.411
So this is the area.

16:52.412 --> 16:52.712
Okay, ready?

16:52.713 --> 16:53.346
Let's go.

17:06.059 --> 17:10.696
We are here, man.

17:15.001 --> 17:15.301
Culture.

17:15.303 --> 17:17.903
We keep the feeling there, make

17:17.904 --> 17:20.406
them feel, not going
to take no more.

17:20.406 --> 17:25.777
Come right up, stick them.

17:25.778 --> 17:30.316
Final step, stun the struggling
creature with a sharp

17:30.317 --> 17:36.655
blow from the mallet or if you
want to go old school, fight

17:36.656 --> 17:38.624
them right in the bray.

17:38.625 --> 17:42.628
In my case, it took repeated

17:42.629 --> 17:48.434
crunching for the
chicklet sized organ.

17:48.435 --> 17:52.271
This one died eventually, likely

17:52.272 --> 17:58.778
by exhaustion as anything
else, I suspected.

18:22.335 --> 18:23.969
Hawaiian renaissance.

18:23.970 --> 18:26.472
This is what really
set things off.

18:26.473 --> 18:29.808
Beginning in 1941 continuing
into the '70s and beyond, the

18:29.809 --> 18:36.982
U.S. Navy been using the
beautiful neighborhood island of

18:36.983 --> 18:44.490
Kaloa as a bombing range.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.325
People have never been happy

18:46.326 --> 18:48.594
about it but emboldened by times

18:48.595 --> 18:50.329
and recent events, a group of

18:50.330 --> 18:53.165
young activists decided
to take a stand.

18:53.166 --> 18:56.768
In 1976, there were a number of
attempted occupations of the

18:56.769 --> 18:59.104
island in protest
of the bombing.

18:59.105 --> 19:01.507
None more successful
than Walter.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.909
He and fellow activist, Richard

19:03.910 --> 19:06.778
Sawyer, sat on the island
and refused to leave.

19:06.779 --> 19:07.779
Back over there.

19:07.780 --> 19:12.851
Managing to evade pursuers just
over a month before finally

19:12.852 --> 19:16.955
being arrested in jail.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.390
The first here.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.759
They emerged, of course, heroes.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.195
And these protests went on to

19:23.196 --> 19:25.297
inspire many others to
enjoy the movement.

19:25.298 --> 19:28.434
Still alive when they happen.

19:28.435 --> 19:29.468
I want to see.

19:29.469 --> 19:35.741
And em body the independent
spirit and desire for Hawaiian

19:35.742 --> 19:37.910
sovereignty that today
resonates across generations.

happened to the
rest of the island.

20:38.271 --> 20:40.939
Essentially an old

800 years old.

Something in modern times, we're

21:23.149 --> 21:27.486
still struggling to figure out.

21:27.487 --> 21:28.354
People think about us.

21:28.355 --> 21:31.923
The true story, we have a place
of abundance and trying to

21:31.924 --> 21:32.658
protect it.

21:32.659 --> 21:36.194
Trying to protect all of these
things we've been trying to

21:36.195 --> 21:38.864
protect for the last 30 years
and it's getting harder and

21:38.865 --> 21:39.098
harder.

Every single one of these
Hawaiians over here, get enough

21:43.870 --> 21:46.004
evidence that the state of
Hawaii, the department of

21:46.005 --> 21:49.675
natural resources have
done a terrible job.

21:49.676 --> 21:51.209
We're not even
looking for blame.

21:51.210 --> 21:53.178
We're looking for an
agreement for today.

21:53.179 --> 21:55.113
Right.

21:55.114 --> 21:57.783
We all are going to be pono.

We're all going to be
righteous and good.

Is it the question,
who is Hawaiian?

22:14.534 --> 22:16.368
You can be Hawaiian.

Come on.

Don't now.

This is a different story.

I can give you the
best explanation.

You cannot be our blood.

22:26.413 --> 22:32.418
You cannot be kanapa.

22:32.419 --> 22:34.085
Hawaii is our nationality.

27:52.872 --> 27:55.306
Those are my two daughters.

27:55.307 --> 27:58.609
This is my wife, Felicia.

27:58.610 --> 28:00.445
Hi, how are you?

28:00.446 --> 28:02.113
Come say hi.

28:02.114 --> 28:02.881
Milton.

28:02.882 --> 28:05.817
This is Milton.

28:05.818 --> 28:07.953
How does everybody
know each other here?

28:07.954 --> 28:09.955
We live on an island.

28:09.956 --> 28:10.956
Everybody knows everybody.

28:10.957 --> 28:13.825
Why do I even ask?

28:13.826 --> 28:17.228
I think I met uncle
Ross through the water.

28:17.229 --> 28:19.297
Surfing, we became like family.

28:19.298 --> 28:23.134
He's like my dad.

28:23.135 --> 28:24.502
My ohana.

28:24.503 --> 28:30.508
Each and every weekend, Ross
can be found here with his

28:30.509 --> 28:35.513
ohana, extended
family and friends.

28:35.514 --> 28:36.414
Beautiful day.

28:36.415 --> 28:38.183
Even when it's storming,
it's nice on the beach.

28:38.184 --> 28:39.017
Yeah.

28:39.018 --> 28:39.318
Yeah.

28:39.319 --> 28:42.754
And we'll stay here until
that thing goes down.

28:42.755 --> 28:44.756
Hits the horizon.

28:44.757 --> 28:48.994
When the sun hits the horizon,
it's time to go home.

28:48.995 --> 28:52.430
Maui is an island as beautiful
as it gets and sure,

28:52.431 --> 28:55.533
it's got share of
portion-controlled cruise line

28:55.534 --> 29:02.207
entertainments, doled out
and digestible bites and

29:02.208 --> 29:08.479
complementary Mai Tais but a
beloved institution like tasty

29:08.480 --> 29:08.881
crust.

29:08.882 --> 29:11.883
Local a place as
you're likely to find.

29:11.884 --> 29:15.787
Daniel Akitahito will explain.

29:15.788 --> 29:18.556
This is a situation I
can order for you.

29:18.557 --> 29:21.292
I think we'll hook you up
with the local flavor.

29:21.293 --> 29:22.293
Okay, I trust.

29:22.294 --> 29:25.663
Raised on the big island,
he's a journalist.

29:25.664 --> 29:27.665
First Hawaiian editor of a major

29:27.666 --> 29:30.836
surf publication and founder of
the local contrast magazine.

29:30.837 --> 29:34.973
Local culture is very much so
trying to point a finger at

29:34.974 --> 29:39.644
anybody coming going,
hey, you don't belong.

29:39.645 --> 29:43.048
Therein kind of lies a little
conflict we have of being a

29:43.049 --> 29:44.015
modern day Hawaiian.

29:44.016 --> 29:47.152
And I still think that's
something we forget about these

29:47.153 --> 29:52.991
days is how educated and how
accepting our ancestors were.

29:52.992 --> 29:56.561
It was always built on
incluesivity, aloha.

29:56.562 --> 30:00.899
Aloha is giving without
expecting anything in return.

30:00.900 --> 30:06.938
You've got a Hawaiian
culture part of

30:06.939 --> 30:11.176
populated the islands and the
local part of the plantation

30:11.177 --> 30:11.510
lifestyle.

30:11.511 --> 30:15.180
The Japanese, the Chinese, the

30:15.181 --> 30:17.916
Koreans, Filipinos, Portuguese.

30:17.917 --> 30:20.685
All can be explained
what's on your plate.

30:20.686 --> 30:23.288
This is a prime example.

30:23.289 --> 30:25.957
Behold.

30:25.958 --> 30:29.560
The most identifiable and
essential feature of the plate

30:29.561 --> 30:30.695
lunch is this.

30:30.696 --> 30:37.202
A big scoop or two of white
rice and potato Mac salad.

30:37.203 --> 30:40.438
There is nothing more Hawaiian

30:40.439 --> 30:45.043
with protein or this hamburger
steak, like Patty drowned in

30:45.044 --> 30:50.748
dark sinister
stinky shiny gravy.

30:50.749 --> 30:54.319
Or voodoo nori with sesame seed.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.486
That looks beautiful.

30:55.487 --> 30:58.223
That's going to work.

30:58.224 --> 30:58.756
All right.

30:58.757 --> 31:00.658
Sit this right on
top of the rice.

31:00.659 --> 31:01.060
Yep.

31:01.061 --> 31:05.563
Get some of that
salad on there too.

31:05.564 --> 31:13.564
Get the gravey on.

31:13.973 --> 31:16.107
They're fundamentally local.

31:16.108 --> 31:20.946
This food, the most delicious,
let's be honest, delicious.

31:20.947 --> 31:23.081
This is not healthy eating.

31:23.082 --> 31:26.517
We're kind of paying the price
for it right now in the

31:26.518 --> 31:29.487
health of the state.

31:29.488 --> 31:30.088
Which is terrible.

31:30.089 --> 31:34.025
As I take a bite of a hamburger.

31:34.026 --> 31:35.760
As I said, just so good.

31:35.761 --> 31:40.031
If you really want to do Hawaii
right, you've got to get

31:40.032 --> 31:40.432
that.

31:40.433 --> 31:46.771
That's a power that Hawaii has
is that if you show aloha and

31:46.772 --> 31:50.942
you give without asking, the Ina

31:50.943 --> 31:55.546
is going to recognize it and
shower its blessings upon you.

31:55.547 --> 31:58.483
So you think traditional
Hawaiian culture and lifestyle

31:58.484 --> 32:02.120
has a chance against
the modern world?

32:02.121 --> 32:02.787
I think so.

32:02.788 --> 32:07.358
The beautiful part about my
ancestors is they realized there

32:07.359 --> 32:11.362
was a limited number of
resources where they lived, so

32:11.363 --> 32:14.799
they observed nature to the best

32:14.800 --> 32:15.800
possible they could to figure

32:15.801 --> 32:17.202
out what were the cycles and how

32:17.203 --> 32:20.738
do we preserve this resource?

32:20.739 --> 32:23.908
Hawaiian culture can teach the
whole world something that it

32:23.909 --> 32:26.577
needs to know, that we
all live on an island.

32:26.578 --> 32:30.848
And we are all part of
the same community.

32:30.849 --> 32:35.954
Let's all show aloha to the Ina
and everybody else as well.

32:53.205 --> 32:56.041
An extraordinary man
lives in this house.

32:56.042 --> 32:57.675
Chef Gordon.

32:57.676 --> 33:00.178
Long time resident on Maui.

33:00.179 --> 33:01.112
Legendary talent manager.

33:01.113 --> 33:06.584
Maybe you know some of the
people whose careers he's looked

33:06.585 --> 33:07.753
after.

33:07.953 --> 33:10.221
Alice Cooper.

33:10.222 --> 33:10.456
Blondie.

33:10.457 --> 33:11.222
Pink Floyd.

33:11.223 --> 33:16.761
He was years ahead of
the chef explosion.

33:16.762 --> 33:18.763
Shepherding emeril
through his career.

33:18.764 --> 33:21.366
Great chefs like Roger.

33:21.367 --> 33:26.037
Close to holiness
the Dalai lama.

33:26.038 --> 33:28.139
Basically done everything with
everybody in every place.

33:28.140 --> 33:30.141
I first got here 40 years ago.

33:30.142 --> 33:32.043
I put one foot on the island and

33:32.044 --> 33:34.212
I knew I was living here
the rest of my life.

33:34.213 --> 33:37.815
Do you ever look out there
and it's wallpaper?

33:37.816 --> 33:39.950
I say it out loud.

33:39.951 --> 33:40.951
First words in the morning.

33:40.952 --> 33:44.489
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

33:44.490 --> 33:44.923
Every day.

33:44.924 --> 33:48.593
Chef is famously one of the
most generous and enthusiastic

33:48.594 --> 33:50.928
of hosts, a more stand-up loyal

33:50.929 --> 33:53.764
guy you could barely imagine
and no wonder they call the

33:53.765 --> 33:57.902
documentary based on his
life "super Mitch."

33:57.903 --> 34:00.071
That's how he's known
around the world.

34:00.072 --> 34:04.609
Here, he's known that guy
who throws great parties.

34:04.610 --> 34:08.413
Prep starts early.

34:08.414 --> 34:16.087
With chef's friend, Julio, a
Maui-born and bred rancher with

34:16.088 --> 34:17.588
help from Sheldon.

34:17.589 --> 34:21.592
Middle of the night, in a
traditional emu is done filled

34:21.592 --> 34:22.827
with lava rocks.

34:22.828 --> 34:25.530
The fire allowed to burn down to

34:25.531 --> 34:27.431
coals before the pig wrapped in

34:27.433 --> 34:32.370
combination of banana leaves
and tea leaves is dropped in.

34:32.371 --> 34:36.607
Okay, you guys ready
for the unveiling?

34:36.608 --> 34:36.875
Hold on.

34:36.876 --> 34:42.313
12 hours later, you dig it up
and well, it's party time.

34:42.313 --> 34:45.616
What you've been saying is
you've been drinking steadily

34:45.617 --> 34:46.317
since 5:00 this morning.

34:46.318 --> 34:49.255
I didn't say, it didn't
come out of my mouth.

34:52.891 --> 34:54.525
Behold.

34:54.525 --> 34:58.229
The magnificence.

34:58.230 --> 35:02.833
It's a very important
part of your childhood.

35:02.834 --> 35:05.069
Dun dun.

35:05.070 --> 35:05.237
Wow.

35:05.237 --> 35:05.571
Look at that.

35:05.572 --> 35:07.138
You just lift the
bones out by hand.

35:07.139 --> 35:07.373
Yep.

35:07.374 --> 35:10.808
Ready?

35:10.809 --> 35:12.577
Just dump them in into a bucket.

35:12.578 --> 35:13.122
Awesome.

35:17.816 --> 35:18.316
Wow.

35:21.653 --> 35:22.253
Wow.

35:22.254 --> 35:25.691
That's pretty much the
way I want to end up.

35:25.991 --> 35:28.326
Pour me into a pot.

35:28.327 --> 35:31.762
There's lots to do and
everyone pitches in to help.

35:31.763 --> 35:33.764
It's an extended, all day affair

35:33.765 --> 35:38.035
of prepping, chopping,
dicing, slicing, mixing.

35:38.036 --> 35:40.171
Of course there is some
sampling along the way.

35:40.172 --> 35:42.340
Like this wild pig sausage that

35:42.341 --> 35:46.110
someone was nice enough
to stop by with.

35:46.111 --> 35:49.747
Sheldon works up a
potato-Mac salad.

35:49.748 --> 35:50.515
One more type.

35:50.516 --> 35:53.251
Hit me one more time.

35:53.252 --> 35:59.790
Julio carves up unicorn fish
he caught earlier in the day.

35:59.791 --> 36:01.959
A couple of fresh red snappers

36:01.960 --> 36:04.362
are stuffed before being
thrown in the oven.

36:04.363 --> 36:08.633
There is Po I pounded
fresh out back.

36:08.634 --> 36:10.201
Somewhere, somewhere pig's foot

36:10.202 --> 36:15.540
soup is happily bubbling away.

36:15.541 --> 36:18.709
Why do I want to do this?

36:18.710 --> 36:21.145
There is chili pepper water used

36:21.146 --> 36:23.748
for dipping or taken as a shot

36:23.749 --> 36:29.654
for boner medicine or whatever.

36:29.655 --> 36:30.821
Oh, yeah.

36:30.822 --> 36:32.890
There is also spam noodles.

36:32.891 --> 36:38.296
There is no party without spam.

36:38.297 --> 36:41.499
By dinner time the beerks wine

36:41.500 --> 36:44.302
and festive beverages have
been flowing for hours.

36:44.303 --> 36:47.905
Moods have been adjusted in
a completely natural way

36:47.906 --> 36:50.841
indigenous to the
islands, of course.

36:50.842 --> 36:53.912
How about Julio and the pig?

36:54.246 --> 36:55.780
Oh, man.

36:55.781 --> 36:57.815
I have cooked a lot of things.

36:57.816 --> 37:01.286
I ain't never seen one poured.

37:01.287 --> 37:02.653
Into a pot neatly.

37:02.654 --> 37:04.589
It's what I love.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.357
This is what we
do on the island.

37:06.358 --> 37:08.693
This is what it's about.

37:08.694 --> 37:10.695
Always bring the
family, the kids.

37:10.696 --> 37:15.366
You rarely ever see a party
where there aren't kids.

37:15.367 --> 37:19.003
Ohana means the... family.

37:19.004 --> 37:22.206
Extended family.

37:22.207 --> 37:27.445
Like you are now ohana
to everybody here.

37:27.446 --> 37:30.981
So we can borrow money from you.

37:30.982 --> 37:37.555
As happens, I have come to
find out things end up in the

needs to be a sense of

connection to a place.

38:41.587 --> 38:45.556
Some sense of
responsibility for it.

It's about being honest to a

whales, like close up.

39:28.266 --> 39:30.968
I had reasons for optimism.

39:30.969 --> 39:32.837
All week I had been staring out

39:32.838 --> 39:35.573
to see watching lump back whales

It's good to hear they have

40:00.131 --> 40:04.802
It's mating season in Hawaii
