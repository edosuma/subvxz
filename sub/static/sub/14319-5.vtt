Well,
maybe not too gentle.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.083
(GROWLING)

14:39.958 --> 14:43.458
I wish
you would tell me more
about this place, Magneto.

14:43.458 --> 14:45.875
Its splendor
seems boundless.

14:47.458 --> 14:51.583
Halt, trespasser.
Advance no farther.

14:51.583 --> 14:53.750
Who are you?
What do you want with us?

14:53.750 --> 14:55.750
Ask your companion.

14:55.750 --> 15:00.208
All the Mutates
in the Savage Land
are Magneto's creations.

15:00.208 --> 15:02.458
We now
follow a new master.

15:02.458 --> 15:03.958
What does she mean?

15:03.958 --> 15:06.000
It doesn't matter now.

15:06.000 --> 15:10.208
Surrender,
so I can make your death
as painless as possible.

15:10.208 --> 15:12.750
Let us talk.
We mean you no...

15:12.750 --> 15:14.000
(SCREECHING)

15:14.000 --> 15:15.625
(BOTH GROANING)

15:19.375 --> 15:20.583
(GRUNTS)

15:26.708 --> 15:28.458
MAGNETO:
I have you, Charles.

15:29.583 --> 15:31.166
(STRAINS)

15:35.458 --> 15:36.875
Hold on!

15:51.875 --> 15:55.750
You will
never leave
here alive. Never!

16:03.833 --> 16:05.750
Can't you
speed this up?

16:05.750 --> 16:09.125
I was promised the time
to take proper precautions!

16:09.125 --> 16:11.458
We have a man's
life in our hands.

16:16.375 --> 16:17.708
(GROANS)

16:17.708 --> 16:19.875
Thanks for the light, kid.

16:19.875 --> 16:22.125
I could use a good tan.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.375
(SCREAMING)

16:27.458 --> 16:29.000
(GASPS)

16:29.000 --> 16:30.708
CYCLOPS: Jean, what
is it? What's wrong?

16:30.708 --> 16:35.833
Wolverine...
Felt him...
Such pain.

16:35.833 --> 16:38.250
Man been a pain
since the get-go, chere.

16:38.250 --> 16:41.458
Not funny, Gambit.
Do you know where
Wolverine is, Jean?

16:41.458 --> 16:43.416
Can you help us find him?

16:43.416 --> 16:47.583
No,
the impression was
too vague, too distant.

16:47.583 --> 16:51.375
But wherever he is,
heaven help him.

16:51.375 --> 16:53.000
(SCREAMING)

16:55.083 --> 16:57.166
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

17:02.375 --> 17:04.250
That's enough! No more.

17:17.333 --> 17:19.416
Resume the probe!

17:19.416 --> 17:23.583
I scanned
as deeply as I could
and we learned nothing.

17:23.583 --> 17:26.083
We're wasting our time
and we're hurting him.

17:26.083 --> 17:29.750
Very well.
We'll just have to
do this the hard way.

17:29.750 --> 17:33.125
The only sure way to learn
the secret of Wolverine's
skeleton

17:33.125 --> 17:35.083
is to remove
it from his body.

17:35.083 --> 17:36.875
Are you crazy?

17:36.875 --> 17:39.458
He's no animal
that you can cut apart!

17:39.458 --> 17:41.166
It's his own fault!

17:41.166 --> 17:43.208
His desertion
weakened this
department!

17:43.208 --> 17:47.500
Hey,
you want my
bones, Chasen?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.833
Come and get them yourself.

17:49.833 --> 17:51.708
He's right, General.

17:51.708 --> 17:53.708
You're going to have
to do your own dirty
work.

17:53.708 --> 17:57.000
Effective immediately,
I quit!

17:58.500 --> 18:01.000
Stop!
I gave you an order!

18:01.000 --> 18:02.458
Heather!

18:02.458 --> 18:04.583
No, James.
You know this is wrong!

18:11.458 --> 18:12.875
Sentimental fool!

18:12.875 --> 18:15.333
I won't let you
hurt him any more!

18:15.333 --> 18:17.125
Let me go!

18:19.083 --> 18:21.333
-That's enough! Let me go!
-VINDICATOR: Heather, please!

18:27.291 --> 18:30.875
You hurt her, Vindicator,
you'll pay!

18:30.875 --> 18:33.000
Shut up, you fool!

18:33.000 --> 18:36.208
All right, Vindicator,
I want that skeleton now!

18:36.208 --> 18:40.458
What's
the matter, old pal?
Forget your pocket knife?

18:40.458 --> 18:43.750
We saved you!
We gave you back your life!

18:43.750 --> 18:45.083
How could you leave us?

18:45.083 --> 18:48.000
So I could
be your weapon?

18:48.000 --> 18:50.083
Sorry, James.

18:50.083 --> 18:51.458
James! Stop!

18:53.000 --> 18:54.750
What are you doing here?

18:54.750 --> 18:57.583
Checking up on
a rumor, General.

18:57.583 --> 19:01.958
You told us we were getting
Wolverine back so he could
work with us again.

19:01.958 --> 19:04.708
Looks like we
were told wrong.

19:04.708 --> 19:07.583
Security!
Subdue Alpha Flight!

19:17.291 --> 19:19.750
Hey, these guys
aren't even human!

19:20.958 --> 19:22.291
They're androids!

19:23.500 --> 19:26.000
Oh, this is gonna be fun!

19:28.708 --> 19:31.250
Stop them! Vindicator,
call off your team.

19:34.875 --> 19:36.458
(GRUNTING)

19:36.458 --> 19:38.125
(SHOUTING)

19:40.416 --> 19:41.458
(GROANS)

19:50.958 --> 19:52.416
(GRUNTS)

19:57.250 --> 19:59.750
Traitor!
You're not going!

19:59.750 --> 20:01.625
Out of my way.

20:01.625 --> 20:04.000
I won't let you
leave us again!

20:04.000 --> 20:06.458
Chasen was wrong, but
you're still part of
Alpha Flight.

20:10.708 --> 20:12.500
My force field!

20:12.500 --> 20:14.750
WOLVERINE:
You should have
let me go, Jimbo.

20:16.708 --> 20:17.708
No!

20:17.708 --> 20:19.291
Stay out of this, Heather.

20:20.708 --> 20:22.291
You cared for me once.

20:22.291 --> 20:25.458
If you still do,
let my husband go.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.875
I still love him.

20:27.875 --> 20:28.875
This time.

20:29.458 --> 20:31.125
For you.

20:31.125 --> 20:34.500
But if any of you ever
comes after me again,

20:34.500 --> 20:36.583
for any reason,

20:36.583 --> 20:39.000
all bets are off.
