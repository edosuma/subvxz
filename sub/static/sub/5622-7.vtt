Carol... chose... me!

00:20.988 --> 00:22.721
(grunts)

00:22.723 --> 00:23.789
You need to be punished!

00:23.791 --> 00:24.823
No.

00:24.825 --> 00:25.657
I'm leaving Malibu.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.059
Carol,

00:27.061 --> 00:28.227
will you
come with me?

00:28.229 --> 00:29.395
I'm pregnant, Phil.

00:31.398 --> 00:32.965
What?

00:34.300 --> 00:36.268
What did she say?
Not now.

00:38.004 --> 00:39.471
I'm sorry, I didn't hear,
and Tandy won't...

00:39.473 --> 00:41.473
She said she's pregnant.
I'm pregnant.

00:41.475 --> 00:46.211
Wow. Um... congratulations.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.482
Eri-Erica!

00:50.484 --> 00:52.985
I think you've said enough
for one day.

00:54.754 --> 00:56.989
Um, Phil,

00:56.991 --> 00:59.358
I'm gonna have
to pass on your offer

00:59.360 --> 01:02.895
to run away with you. So...

01:02.897 --> 01:04.396
(quietly):
My God.

01:05.532 --> 01:08.167
Whew, that did not go well
for you.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.535
You
really blew it.

01:09.537 --> 01:11.103
Talk about a face-plant, huh?
Okay,

01:11.105 --> 01:14.173
that's enough.
Try to take my woman. Facial!

01:15.175 --> 01:16.542
Facial express.
Tandy. Tandy. Stop it.

01:16.544 --> 01:18.377
Burn.
Be the bigger man about this.

01:18.379 --> 01:19.545
What?

01:19.547 --> 01:20.546
It'll be fine.

01:20.548 --> 01:21.413
I promise.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.449
Erica,

01:23.451 --> 01:26.085
I'm sorry
about what I said to Carol.

01:26.087 --> 01:28.420
If I had known about
your situation, I would have...

01:28.422 --> 01:29.621
never said that.
Oh,

01:29.623 --> 01:31.423
so we're calling this
a situation?

01:31.425 --> 01:33.759
No, no, no. Bad-bad choice
of words. I just...

01:33.761 --> 01:35.294
Look,
we're in

01:35.296 --> 01:36.795
this weird place right now.
Weird place?

01:36.797 --> 01:39.932
Phil,
I'm having a frigging baby.

01:39.934 --> 01:41.700
I think you'd
better leave now.
Gail,

01:41.702 --> 01:43.969
please, this is
between me and Erica.

01:43.971 --> 01:46.638
There is nothing between
you and Erica anymore.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.441
You made that perfectly clear
when you confessed your love

01:49.443 --> 01:51.810
to Carol not
five minutes ago.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.645
I'm the father of her child.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.280
Not anymore.
What?

01:55.282 --> 01:57.616
Oh, it'll have a father.
Just not you.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.452
The whole group
is gonna be the father.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.055
Are we done here?

02:03.057 --> 02:05.491
I'm not going anywhere
until I hear this from her.

02:05.493 --> 02:08.494
(sighs)

02:08.496 --> 02:10.896
Okay. I think I heard her say,
"We're done."

02:11.931 --> 02:14.266
You have a nice day, you hear?
Erica...

02:14.268 --> 02:15.767
Can you believe that guy?

02:15.769 --> 02:18.070
He beats me up,
he tries to steal my wife

02:18.072 --> 02:20.105
while he's got a bun
in Erica's oven.

02:20.107 --> 02:22.141
What a friggin' dong.

02:22.143 --> 02:24.443
Well, that's the dong
that's gonna get you back

02:24.445 --> 02:25.677
into this community.

02:25.679 --> 02:28.280
You should be kissing that dong.
Why should I

02:28.282 --> 02:31.183
be kissing that dong? I should
be friggin' punching that dong.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.519
Have you ever seen
those dogs with no back legs

02:33.521 --> 02:35.954
so they give 'em the little
wheels to scoot around on?

02:35.956 --> 02:38.790
It's the cutest thing ever,
right?

02:38.792 --> 02:41.126
I'm not really seeing
the connection here.

02:41.128 --> 02:43.996
People love wounded animals,

02:43.998 --> 02:45.631
and that's you now.

02:45.633 --> 02:48.433
Your face is like those crippled
little puppy legs,

02:48.435 --> 02:49.768
and you just got

02:49.770 --> 02:51.436
to roll around on the sidewalk

02:51.438 --> 02:54.306
for a while to make everybody
feel sorry for you.

02:54.308 --> 02:57.209
Sorry, Carol, no, okay?
If I want people to trust me,

02:57.211 --> 02:59.178
I got to do this the right way,
okay?

02:59.180 --> 03:01.180
And I'm not gonna play
the sympathy card.

03:01.182 --> 03:03.115
(moaning loudly)

03:03.117 --> 03:05.184
(moaning continues)

03:07.220 --> 03:09.855
Good God.
(chuckles)

03:09.857 --> 03:12.357
Somebody have, like, an aspirin
or a pain reducer

03:12.359 --> 03:14.626
or, like, a-a time machine?

03:14.628 --> 03:16.361
(chuckles)
As if.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.663
(groans)

03:17.665 --> 03:20.332
(panting, snarling)

03:20.334 --> 03:22.034
(breathing rapidly)

03:22.036 --> 03:24.469
It comes in waves.

03:24.471 --> 03:27.072
Unfortunately,
it's high tide right now, but...

03:27.074 --> 03:28.807
(sighs)
I'm fine though. I'm fine.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.542
Can we just change the subject?

03:30.544 --> 03:33.478
Look at him, not wanting
to talk about himself again.

03:33.480 --> 03:34.913
Have you guys noticed that?

03:34.915 --> 03:37.149
That eye does
look pretty grim.

03:37.151 --> 03:40.919
Thanks, Melissa.
(chuckles)

03:42.889 --> 03:45.591
So, Erica, have you thought
of any baby names yet?

03:45.593 --> 03:47.192
No.
Well,

03:47.194 --> 03:49.394
if you could just steer clear
of the name Yorbalinda,

03:49.396 --> 03:50.862
I'd appreciate it.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.764
Not a problem.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.233
And also Beziqueel.

03:54.235 --> 03:56.568
Won't be an issue.
You know,

03:56.570 --> 03:58.870
I always hoped Yorbalinda
would be the first baby

03:58.872 --> 04:00.339
of this new world.

04:00.341 --> 04:03.075
But Tandy and I won't be
far behind, and...

04:03.077 --> 04:04.676
(groans)
and,
if I'm being honest,

04:04.678 --> 04:06.878
getting to watch
you have a baby first

04:06.880 --> 04:08.914
will really calm my nerves.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.616
What a luxury for you.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.784
(clears throat)

04:12.786 --> 04:16.555
Erica, can I, uh, talk
to you for a second?

04:16.557 --> 04:17.889
Anything you have
to say to her,

04:17.891 --> 04:20.025
you can say to the whole group.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.461
Fine. I made something for you.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.363
It's in the pool house.
I'd love to...

04:24.365 --> 04:26.031
love to show it to you.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.100
GAIL:
Yeah,

04:28.102 --> 04:30.335
she won't be doing that.
So get along.

04:32.939 --> 04:36.208
(scoffs)

04:36.210 --> 04:37.609
(groans)

04:37.611 --> 04:39.645
What a turd.

04:39.647 --> 04:42.381
I think he's almost worse
than Tandy.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.249
Seriously, Gail?

04:44.251 --> 04:46.385
Almost worse than me?

04:46.387 --> 04:48.287
Thank you.

04:50.456 --> 04:53.191
♪ ♪

05:01.668 --> 05:03.669
Look at this guy.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.837
Friggin' dip.

05:05.839 --> 05:09.174
How does it feel
to be yesterday's news, huh?

05:09.176 --> 05:11.310
And I'm the hot topic.

05:11.312 --> 05:13.779
"This just in,
Phil's worse than Tandy.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.314
Now over to the weather."

05:15.316 --> 05:17.316
"Grey skies for that dong.

05:17.318 --> 05:20.085
Clear skies in Tandyville.
Back to you, Bob."

05:20.087 --> 05:22.521
"Thanks, Tabitha. In local news,

05:22.523 --> 05:26.658
no one cares what's in your
friggin' house, you jagweed."

05:26.660 --> 05:31.063
What's in your house,
you friggin' jagweed?

05:41.007 --> 05:44.810
What are you doing in there,
you friggin' idiot, huh?

05:44.812 --> 05:47.612
You practicing
your weak punches, pledging

05:47.614 --> 05:50.382
your love
to other people's wives?

05:50.384 --> 05:53.185
Sitting sadly amongst
a bunch of baby furniture

05:53.187 --> 05:56.188
you made
for your unborn child?

05:56.190 --> 05:59.157
No. I don't feel bad for you,

05:59.159 --> 06:03.562
you friggin'
sad, sad man.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.464
Who needs someone right now.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.432
Oh, God.

06:08.401 --> 06:10.869
Jerk.

06:16.142 --> 06:17.843
Okay, so,
this is for you, Erica.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.511
(gasps)
Aw.

06:19.513 --> 06:21.747
Thanks, Carol.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.682
I originally made it
for Yorbalinda,

06:23.684 --> 06:25.150
but since your baby's
coming first,

06:25.152 --> 06:26.585
I want you to have it.

06:26.587 --> 06:29.388
Is this how big
a newborn's head is?

06:29.390 --> 06:32.257
Well, a baby's head's
not flat like that.

06:32.259 --> 06:34.760
It's big like a bowling ball
that's been waterlogged

06:34.762 --> 06:36.862
after baking in the sun.

06:36.864 --> 06:40.399
Crazy we can push something
like that out of us, huh?

06:40.401 --> 06:43.235
Aw, man, we're pretty
amazing creatures, you and I.

06:44.337 --> 06:46.605
And you, too, Gail,
if you got on board.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.173
Drop it, Carol.

06:48.175 --> 06:50.175
Hey, ladies, up here,
coming down the stairs.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.177
Let me know if there's
anything in my way.

06:52.179 --> 06:53.712
100% vision over here,

06:53.714 --> 06:55.247
but this side is
real touch-and-go.

06:55.249 --> 06:56.715
Well, is your eye
still smartin'?

06:56.717 --> 06:58.183
Let me take a look at it.

07:01.053 --> 07:02.220
Oh, it looks like
it's getting better.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.255
You think so?
Uh-huh.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.523
Yeah, let me check that out.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.824
Huh.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.596
(grunting)

07:11.598 --> 07:13.532
Aah!

07:13.534 --> 07:14.966
Huh, that's weird.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.935
It looks about the same to me.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.370
Maybe even worse.
Oh, yeah.

07:18.372 --> 07:20.238
Must've been the lighting.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.040
Like I said, uh,
comes in waves.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.042
Hold on, Tandy.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.578
Got a little ol' garter snake
in our midst.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.146
(Phil 2 chuckles)

07:28.148 --> 07:30.482
Well-well, I already
know the answer,

07:30.484 --> 07:31.750
but I thought I'd ask anyways.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.051
I'm making a supply run.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.786
Anybody need anything?

07:38.090 --> 07:40.559
Okay.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.994
What a tool.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.063
I mean, if he really
wanted to make amends,

07:45.065 --> 07:47.299
he'd go get
in the stocks over there.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.967
Yeah, it's do the crime,
do the time.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.636
Not do the crime,
offer to get everybody supplies.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.071
Tool.

07:53.073 --> 07:55.140
Which is a shame,
because I'm jonesing

07:55.142 --> 07:58.310
for some tortilla chips
in the worst way.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.645
Yeah, I'm jonesing for some
stool softener in that same way.

08:00.647 --> 08:03.782
Uh, you know, for, uh,
a friend, you know?

08:03.784 --> 08:05.450
Okay.
Todd, he's
got some hard stool.

08:05.452 --> 08:08.453
And, uh, I guess I got
to go pick that up

08:08.455 --> 08:10.188
for him, uh, myself.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.823
Okay, well, if you're
gonna go to the store,

08:11.825 --> 08:14.259
would you mind picking me up
some tortilla chips?

08:14.261 --> 08:15.460
Seriously, Gail?!

08:15.462 --> 08:17.362
You-you would,
you would trust me

08:17.364 --> 08:19.264
to get you tortilla chips?

08:20.633 --> 08:22.300
It's just tortilla chips.

08:22.302 --> 08:23.635
Hey, Gail?

08:23.637 --> 08:25.470
I'll get you those chips.

08:25.472 --> 08:27.172
I mean, it-it's
no problem at all.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.841
Seriously,
it-it would be an honor.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.910
Okay.

08:36.782 --> 08:39.684
TODD:
Don't see any chips.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.653
Maybe this aisle.

08:41.655 --> 08:45.056
Gail actually asked me to get
her tortilla chips, Todd.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.225
Me! I didn't even
have to offer.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.528
She just asked!
That's great,
Tandy.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.396
I'm finally getting
some traction here.

08:51.398 --> 08:54.866
Thank God for Phil beefing
it like that, huh?

08:54.868 --> 08:56.868
Although, I got to admit,
I feel kind of bad for him.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.236
Hey, if we hadn't have
pulled him off of you,

08:58.238 --> 08:59.371
he might've killed you, Tandy.

08:59.373 --> 09:00.872
Yeah, I guess so.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.240
Oh, here's the chip
section right here.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.241
Okay.

09:03.243 --> 09:04.843
Whoa.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.811
I didn't really give
myself enough clearance.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.647
Okay, I guess I'll
use the sunroof here.

09:08.649 --> 09:09.981
Well, do you want
to come out this side?

09:09.983 --> 09:11.216
No, I want
to sunroof it!

09:11.218 --> 09:12.250
Sunroof it.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.419
All right.
You got it?

09:14.421 --> 09:16.755
Already out.

09:18.858 --> 09:20.659
Oh, wow, that's
a lot of chips.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.327
Did she say which
kind she wanted?

09:22.329 --> 09:23.528
Do you think it matters?

09:23.530 --> 09:24.729
Well--
What am I saying?

09:24.731 --> 09:25.897
Of course it matters.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.532
Should we go
back and ask her?

09:27.534 --> 09:29.434
Uh, yeah, Todd,
uh, let's do that.

09:29.436 --> 09:31.536
"Uh, duh, hey,
excuse me, Gail.

09:31.538 --> 09:33.038
Uh, what kind of chips
do you want?"

09:33.040 --> 09:34.239
Oh, that'd be
a great way to start.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.607
All right.
Come on, Todd.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.342
I don't know.
What about these?

09:37.344 --> 09:39.210
Scoops, Todd, really?!

09:39.212 --> 09:40.745
She's not four years old.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.380
Come on, think!

09:42.382 --> 09:44.416
Oh, God!
You know what?

09:44.418 --> 09:45.584
I'll just get them all.

09:45.586 --> 09:47.385
Except for Scoops, Todd.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.087
Whoa.

09:57.630 --> 09:59.564
(sighs)

09:59.566 --> 10:01.766
Oh, sorry, bud,
for throwing such a tizzy,

10:01.768 --> 10:04.035
but, you know, the stakes
are really high here

10:04.037 --> 10:05.704
and I'm just not myself.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.205
Uh, it-it's okay.
Don't mention it.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.374
I've been in a bit of
a funk myself, you know?

10:09.376 --> 10:11.743
Hey, bud, spill the bean dip.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.411
Chips aisle, boom.

10:13.413 --> 10:14.746
Melissa stuff, you know?

10:14.748 --> 10:15.914
Everything's been super weird

10:15.916 --> 10:17.449
since the whole bacon debacle.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.217
She keeps saying she doesn't
want to have a baby.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.819
And blah, blah, blah.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.821
Well, hang in there,
'cause I know for a fact

10:22.823 --> 10:24.556
that she's into
having babies, okay?

10:24.558 --> 10:26.257
So just relax,

10:26.259 --> 10:28.627
and this whole thing
will blow over.

10:28.629 --> 10:30.562
How do you know that?

10:31.797 --> 10:33.632
How do I know that?
Yeah, I guess I don't.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.166
Uh, sorry I did--
you know,

10:35.168 --> 10:36.501
I thought you were talking
about something else.

10:36.503 --> 10:37.769
Tandy.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.237
Tandy! Tandy?

10:39.239 --> 10:41.573
Be honest with me, man.

10:43.175 --> 10:46.945
Todd... honestly?

10:46.947 --> 10:50.148
Tandy... be honest.

10:54.086 --> 10:56.755
Pull!

10:56.757 --> 10:59.858
Hey.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.926
You have anything
you want to tell me?

11:01.928 --> 11:04.596
No.
Nothing?

11:04.598 --> 11:07.198
I got a surfboard today.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.634
But nothing about you
and Tandy going to a park

11:09.636 --> 11:11.670
to try to get his sperm
to fertilize your egg?

11:11.672 --> 11:14.039
I mean, you told me
it was just about having sex.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.508
Todd, you have to
understand the circumstances.

11:16.510 --> 11:19.711
I feel like I'm gonna be sick
out of both ends.

11:19.713 --> 11:22.814
I mean, you can have a baby
with a guy that you've known

11:22.816 --> 11:24.683
for, like, three days,
but you can't have a baby

11:24.685 --> 11:26.184
with the man you love?

11:26.186 --> 11:28.620
Look, I came to my senses.
I changed my mind.

11:28.622 --> 11:32.657
You don't just change your mind
about having a baby.
I did.

11:32.659 --> 11:35.293
Well, don't you think you should
have told me about that?

11:35.295 --> 11:37.829
I mean, it's a pretty big thing
to hide.

11:37.831 --> 11:40.331
So is living a double life
in a frickin' bacon house.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.834
I hid bacon from you!

11:42.836 --> 11:44.669
Bacon!

11:44.671 --> 11:46.905
What you did is much worse!

11:46.907 --> 11:48.907
I guess
we can't trust each other.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.042
I guess not.

11:51.044 --> 11:54.079
Don't shoot!

11:54.081 --> 11:56.481
Sorry. I thought you were...

11:56.483 --> 11:59.384
Never mind.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.885
(gun chamber clicks)

12:00.887 --> 12:04.322
Oh! Thought these
would never get here.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.825
Well, you thought wrong
'cause they did get here, huh?

12:06.827 --> 12:09.360
So what do you want? Uh,
nacho cheese, mission style,

12:09.362 --> 12:10.995
unsalted, extra salt?

12:10.997 --> 12:13.431
Do you have any Scoops?

12:14.600 --> 12:16.401
Scoops, huh? (laughs)

12:16.403 --> 12:17.902
You like Scoops?

12:17.904 --> 12:19.604
They're my favorite.
Oh.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.072
(laughing)

12:21.074 --> 12:22.540
I don't have any Scoops.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.442
(laughs airily)

12:24.444 --> 12:26.945
Okay, well, these'll work.

12:26.947 --> 12:29.180
Okay, well, next time, you're
gonna get Scoops, okay?
Yup.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.683
Gonna go take my wine
for a walk. Thanks, Tandy.

12:31.685 --> 12:33.852
You're welcome, Gail.
I should be thanking you.

12:33.854 --> 12:35.587
(laughing)
God.

12:35.589 --> 12:38.156
Just remember--
the Tandy man can and will.

12:40.526 --> 12:42.494
(laughs)

12:48.968 --> 12:51.836
Do not feel sad for this turd.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.117
Need a hand?

13:06.119 --> 13:09.320
Get away from me.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.422
Okay.

13:11.424 --> 13:15.927
But, look, Phil, can I
offer you a little advice?

13:15.929 --> 13:19.631
I know you don't want to
hear it from me, but, look,

13:19.633 --> 13:22.767
I really think you should
get in those stocks.

13:22.769 --> 13:24.302
(laughing)

13:24.304 --> 13:26.638
You'd love that, wouldn't you?

13:26.640 --> 13:28.740
Huh? Yeah.

13:28.742 --> 13:31.176
Seeing me in those stocks, huh?

13:31.178 --> 13:32.644
No, I wouldn't love it.

13:32.646 --> 13:34.813
I'm-I'm trying
to help you here.

13:34.815 --> 13:37.282
Well, I don't like you, okay?

13:37.284 --> 13:40.685
And I don't trust you.

13:40.687 --> 13:44.322
You are gonna regret this
if you don't do it.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.958
You know what
my biggest regret is,

13:46.960 --> 13:49.194
Tandy? Huh?

13:49.196 --> 13:52.430
It's not breaking up
with Erica,

13:52.432 --> 13:56.467
or-or... or confessing my love

13:56.469 --> 13:59.204
to Carol. No.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.639
My biggest regret

14:01.641 --> 14:05.643
is that I saved you...
from the billboard.

14:05.645 --> 14:10.014
Every day, I wish
I had left you up there

14:10.016 --> 14:12.650
to die.

14:12.652 --> 14:15.119
You don't mean that.
Yes, I do!

14:15.121 --> 14:17.655
You know why?
Huh.

14:17.657 --> 14:21.492
Because everybody's life
got worse

14:21.494 --> 14:23.962
the day they met you.

14:38.410 --> 14:40.078
I mean, this whole Phil
situation is just like

14:40.080 --> 14:42.847
that movie<i> When a Man Loves</i>
<i>a Woman.</i> Okay, show of hands.

14:42.849 --> 14:44.382
Who's seen it?

14:44.384 --> 14:45.984
Anyone besides Peter?

14:45.986 --> 14:48.152
Oh, man, you guys got to see it!

14:48.154 --> 14:49.821
Oh, it's really good.

14:49.823 --> 14:51.589
Meg Ryan's got this terrible
drinking problem,

14:51.591 --> 14:53.658
and she won't accept help
from anyone.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.693
But then, Andy Garcia comes in,
and he's all,

14:55.695 --> 14:57.862
"Whoo-ah! No, I got
to help you with that.

14:57.864 --> 15:00.031
"I-I don't want you
to have a drinking problem.

15:00.033 --> 15:02.400
I'm gonna help ya.
I'm gonna help ya."

15:02.402 --> 15:04.235
And then,
a bunch more words happen.

15:04.237 --> 15:07.605
And then finally, Andy Garcia
has this huge orgasm sound,

15:07.607 --> 15:09.507
and then Rob Reiner's mom
says, like,

15:09.509 --> 15:11.442
"I'll have what he's having!"

15:11.444 --> 15:12.877
(laughing)

15:12.879 --> 15:14.445
Referring to Meg, I guess.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.281
'Cause Meg was having
something delicious

15:16.283 --> 15:18.783
next to Andy Garcia
as he's making the sound.

15:18.785 --> 15:21.119
The bottom line--

15:21.121 --> 15:23.521
Phil is Meg Ryan,

15:23.523 --> 15:26.958
and I got to be
his Andy Garcia.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.459
CAROL:
<i>Hey, Erica, here's some more</i>

15:28.461 --> 15:31.229
baby stuff for you.
All of it says

15:31.231 --> 15:34.365
something about being the first
child of the new world, so,

15:34.367 --> 15:36.467
technically,
they're your property.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.303
Thanks, Carol.
Hey, you know,

15:38.305 --> 15:40.772
um, just out of curiosity,

15:40.774 --> 15:44.409
how long were you and Phil
trying before you got pregnant?

15:44.411 --> 15:46.945
Oh, we weren't trying.

15:46.947 --> 15:50.081
Whoa! Unplanned pregnancy?

15:50.083 --> 15:52.317
That's awesome!

15:52.319 --> 15:54.886
Phil and I have been
trying for, like--

15:54.888 --> 15:57.255
I don't know--
six months now?

15:57.257 --> 15:59.891
And the only thing I have to
show for it are some rug burns

15:59.893 --> 16:02.994
and a deeply-satisfied lover.

16:02.996 --> 16:05.063
Six months? That long?

16:05.065 --> 16:07.999
What? That's a long time?

16:08.001 --> 16:11.936
N... No, I... No, I think
that's actually quite normal.

16:11.938 --> 16:13.304
Yeah.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.840
To-totally normal.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.106

Hey, Tandy.
What's up, buddy?

17:34.154 --> 17:37.388
Why are you sleeping
on the couch?
Uh, man, I don't
want to talk about it.

17:37.390 --> 17:40.858
Okay, well, have you seen Phil?
He's out at the beach.

17:40.860 --> 17:44.629
Well, what's he doing
on the beach?
I don't know.
The guy's a total frickin' mess.

17:52.337 --> 17:53.671
Oh... farts.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.181

18:28.040 --> 18:31.476
Feel free to wake up at any time

18:31.478 --> 18:33.544
Friggin' fart face.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.146
Surfboard limousine is...

18:35.148 --> 18:36.981
(strained voice):
open for business.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.549
Oh.

18:40.152 --> 18:41.786
There we go.
That's the culprit.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.155
Friggin' surfboard fin.

18:44.157 --> 18:47.458
Friggin' idiot fin here.
You seem loose enough.

18:51.997 --> 18:57.068
You bring a surfboard fin,
I bring a gun.

19:10.315 --> 19:11.816
(high-pitched):
Ah! I got it.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.318
Oh, oh, slide it.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.953
(groaning)

19:15.955 --> 19:18.289
Oh, hi, Phil's penis.

19:18.291 --> 19:21.459
I know you didn't mean it, huh?

19:21.461 --> 19:25.863
What you said about leaving me
up on that billboard.

19:25.865 --> 19:29.433
You know, you were frontin',
I was frontin'.

19:29.435 --> 19:33.304
We just got off track,
man, you know?

19:33.306 --> 19:36.674
We were like two bullet trains
headed straight for each other.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.143
There's that penis again.

19:39.145 --> 19:42.780
Getting to know you
pretty well, sir. Oh!

19:42.782 --> 19:46.984
It's just that, you know, every
time we got into our thing,

19:46.986 --> 19:50.321
it was like an alpha dog park.

19:50.323 --> 19:53.224
And the problem was,

19:53.226 --> 19:54.725
we were both off leash.

19:54.727 --> 19:58.162
I wish I was
a lot more like you.

19:58.164 --> 20:01.799
Have you ever seen
<i>When a Man Loves a Woman?</i>

20:01.801 --> 20:05.236
'Cause you are exactly like
Meg Ryan in that.

20:05.238 --> 20:07.872
Here, I'm gonna give you
a taste of my Andy Garcia.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.874
Whoo-ah!

20:09.876 --> 20:12.543
I'm sorry I've been
a turd to you.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.012
Ooh.

20:15.014 --> 20:16.280
(grunting)

20:20.319 --> 20:23.354
The thing you didn't realize is
that I looked up to you,

20:23.356 --> 20:25.556
like, the whole time, huh?

20:25.558 --> 20:27.525
You don't believe
that I've changed,

20:27.527 --> 20:29.660
but I have.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.662
When we wake up tomorrow,

20:31.664 --> 20:34.332
it's gonna start
a whole new chapter for us.

20:38.604 --> 20:40.071
Oh.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.672
(whispering):
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.074
Just go back to bed.

20:44.943 --> 20:47.178
Hey, we're not pregnant.

20:47.180 --> 20:49.914
Oh, don't worry. Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be all right.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.617
Where were you?

20:52.619 --> 20:54.185
Just out helping Phil.

20:54.187 --> 20:57.455
That's nice.
Yeah, right.
Good night.

Good night.

21:05.898 --> 21:09.066
Probably just wants
to thank me.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.635
Tandy!

21:10.637 --> 21:14.071
All right, I'm gonna sleep
