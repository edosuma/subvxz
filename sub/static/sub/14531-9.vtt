WEBVTT

00:39.937 --> 00:42.648
Mrs... it should at least be Ms., huh?

00:47.737 --> 00:49.906
My husband is marrying your husband.

00:49.989 --> 00:52.157
- Yeah.
- I wonder how they decided

00:52.241 --> 00:53.701
whose name went on top.

00:56.704 --> 01:01.208
As germane as that question might be,
I'd like to focus on this hideous font.

01:01.291 --> 01:04.420
If you let your eyes relax,
you can see a lion in there.

01:07.506 --> 01:11.260
Oh, it's really happening.

01:11.343 --> 01:12.511
Here, pull my finger.

01:12.595 --> 01:14.972
No, I'm not doing that
again, fooled me once.

01:15.056 --> 01:17.391
No, pull my ring off!

01:18.726 --> 01:20.728
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:22.021 --> 01:23.522
Weird, huh?

01:25.024 --> 01:27.610
Just make sure it comes off
for good before the wedding.

01:27.693 --> 01:31.655
I don't think I'm going. There's
not an invitation here for me.

01:31.739 --> 01:37.078
Dream on. Sol's probably gonna ask
you to do an interpretive dance.

01:37.161 --> 01:40.330
I don't think I can. I mean, I could...

01:40.414 --> 01:46.129
I mean, I usually see where
my body takes me in the moment.

01:52.384 --> 01:53.928
Kah!

01:54.011 --> 01:56.013
Kah. Kah!

01:56.097 --> 01:58.432
Definitely don't do that.

02:00.309 --> 02:01.310
Okay.

02:04.688 --> 02:07.441
Ta-da! Our first RSVP card.

02:07.524 --> 02:08.567
Who's it from?

02:11.862 --> 02:13.572
Frankie's cousin Donald.

02:13.656 --> 02:15.449
We invited him?

02:15.532 --> 02:17.409
You insisted, as I recall.

02:17.493 --> 02:20.287
That's right, I did. He's a good dancer.

02:20.370 --> 02:23.373
If people are shy about
dancing, he'll kick things off.

02:24.374 --> 02:29.880
He'll have the wild salmon and
the chicken. He's a large dancer.

02:29.964 --> 02:33.509
I still think it's an abomination
we're not serving a red meat option.

02:33.592 --> 02:36.137
Ring, ring. Hello?

02:36.220 --> 02:39.682
Crying mama cow, asking
where her babies are.

02:43.310 --> 02:45.479
[Spit whines]

02:46.939 --> 02:48.691
- [door opens]
- Hey!

02:48.774 --> 02:53.570
Spit! Spit, where are you? Hi.

02:53.654 --> 02:57.741
Oh, there he is! Oh, come here!

02:57.825 --> 03:00.452
Oh, wow, he's fat.

03:00.536 --> 03:02.621
Thank you for taking care of him.

03:02.705 --> 03:04.165
Oh, he was a prince...

03:04.248 --> 03:07.043
except when he puked in
my bed, but then he ate it.

03:07.126 --> 03:09.920
Mmm. He's real thoughtful that way.

03:10.004 --> 03:14.633
He also thoughtfully ate two bees, a
wooden spoon, and my favorite Spanx.

03:14.717 --> 03:16.927
- Did I get any mail?
- [Grace] Oh, yeah.

03:17.011 --> 03:19.930
You know, I think it might be
easier for the DNC to just move in.

03:20.014 --> 03:22.349
Hello, chef. Tell us
what you're making today.

03:22.432 --> 03:23.976
It's personal lubricant.

03:25.477 --> 03:28.814
- Mom, Frankie verbally molested me.
- Join the club, honey.

03:28.898 --> 03:33.318
And you're using this, like,
for... adult lubricating purposes?

03:33.402 --> 03:35.112
- Sure.
- Yeah, we both do.

03:37.364 --> 03:39.658
No. Nope.

03:39.742 --> 03:43.204
No to all of this. I'm
gonna take my dog and go.

03:43.287 --> 03:44.621
Don't you want to say hi to Guy?

03:44.705 --> 03:46.331
Hi, Guy. I gotta go.

03:46.415 --> 03:51.212
Do you know that 84% of
postmenopausal women find sex painful?

03:51.295 --> 03:53.047
Why are you saying those words?

03:53.130 --> 03:55.258
Oh, because I think the
head of a beauty company

03:55.340 --> 03:58.343
might be interested in a
product her customers need.

03:58.427 --> 03:59.720
Mom, we're going younger.

03:59.803 --> 04:03.974
You are missing out on a huge market.
Do you know what they put in most lube?

04:04.058 --> 04:06.602
Paraben. Glycerin. Silicone.

04:06.685 --> 04:10.273
This stuff is all natural, truly organic.

04:10.355 --> 04:11.982
I'm talking farm to vagina.

04:12.066 --> 04:14.985
Women are putting terrible
chemicals in their body,

04:15.069 --> 04:17.446
and the problem is
nobody's talking about it.

04:17.529 --> 04:19.865
No, Mom. The problem is
you're talking about it.

04:19.949 --> 04:22.785
Come on, Spit. We're going to
leave these filthy ladies be.

04:22.868 --> 04:24.536
Wait! Wait.

04:24.620 --> 04:27.706
- Ew. Ew! Mom!
- Just think about it.

04:27.790 --> 04:31.210
Or use it yourself. Personal
lubricant is for everybody.

04:31.294 --> 04:34.088
God! We're never coming back here.

04:37.007 --> 04:38.550
Where are you off to?

04:38.634 --> 04:40.970
Hey, hi.

04:41.053 --> 04:43.055
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

04:43.139 --> 04:45.808
- I'm going to go buy some golf shoes.
- Yeah, we're going golfing.

04:45.891 --> 04:47.268
- You are?
- Mm.

04:47.351 --> 04:51.521
And you are? You don't
strike me as a golf guy, Guy.

04:51.605 --> 04:54.358
I'm doing it for Harris.
You know, he loved golf.

04:54.441 --> 04:55.609
The guy you ate?

04:56.693 --> 04:58.070
The guy he ate.

04:58.154 --> 05:01.448
Hey, why don't I pick up
some hoagies, bring 'em back.

05:01.531 --> 05:02.825
They'd go great with the soup.

05:02.908 --> 05:05.161
Great. I love hoagies!

05:05.244 --> 05:06.662
I'll see you later, huh?

05:06.745 --> 05:08.289
[door shuts]

05:08.372 --> 05:11.292
Now, Grace, walk me through this.

05:11.375 --> 05:13.961
When you eat a hoagie and
then you do your 18 holes,

05:14.044 --> 05:16.839
do you leave your bullshit in
the house or take it with you?

05:16.922 --> 05:21.802
You hate golf. You only
pretended to like it for Robert.

05:21.885 --> 05:25.514
What's real, Grace? Who are you?

05:25.597 --> 05:29.726
Seriously? You just put Sol's
flu shot on our calendar.

05:29.810 --> 05:32.104
I've got to remind him. He never remembers.

05:32.188 --> 05:35.191
- Can you remind me to remind him?
- Frankie, freeze.

05:35.274 --> 05:37.901
I'm going to take a
picture of your dysfunction.

05:37.985 --> 05:40.737
Okay, maybe Sol and I
are a little too close,

05:40.821 --> 05:43.199
but at least I have a
relationship with my ex.

05:43.282 --> 05:45.159
I have a relationship with Robert.

05:45.242 --> 05:49.205
In fact, he's coming over later to
borrow my big book of party vendors.

05:49.288 --> 05:53.709
Oh, so it's okay for you to spend
time with your ex-husband, but not me.

05:53.792 --> 05:56.170
It's okay if my
six-foot-four,

05:56.253 --> 05:58.755
still boyishly good-looking
lover's going to be here.

05:58.839 --> 06:02.718
I see what you're doing.
Accidental meeting.

06:02.801 --> 06:06.305
Erica Kane did that to Dimitri
Marick on All My Children.

06:06.389 --> 06:09.183
Someone ended up dying,
then coming back as a twin

06:09.266 --> 06:12.353
and then dying again in a grain silo.

06:13.729 --> 06:15.314
I like it.

06:15.398 --> 06:16.606
[scoffs]

06:16.690 --> 06:18.608
Okay, how about this?

06:18.692 --> 06:22.029
A hand cream that's also a foot
cream that's also an eye cream.

06:22.112 --> 06:24.823
- Three-in-ones are big right now.
- Four-in-ones are big right now.

06:24.907 --> 06:26.242
But is anyone
doing a five-in-one?

06:26.325 --> 06:29.536
But if we put everything in one product,
how do we sell our other products?

06:31.121 --> 06:33.040
Is it time to bring back potpourri?

06:33.123 --> 06:35.167
Is it 1989 in my
grandma's underwear drawer?

06:35.251 --> 06:38.337
Okay, okay. I'm just trying
to think outside the box, Adam.

06:38.421 --> 06:40.089
There's a reason why Alberto VO5 is dying.

06:40.172 --> 06:43.092
It's because there's no Alberto
VO6. We need something new.

06:43.175 --> 06:45.010
Which is exactly why
I pitched lotion socks,

06:45.094 --> 06:47.763
which I know you hated and I shouldn't
be bringing up right now, but...

06:47.846 --> 06:51.183
And yet you are bringing it up again,
Stephen. Nobody wants lotion socks.

06:51.267 --> 06:52.476
You need to stop saying it.

06:52.559 --> 06:54.019
Ooh! Should we get your
mom on speakerphone?

06:54.103 --> 06:56.105
Because she is really good
at coming up with new stuff.

06:56.188 --> 06:57.606
- Yeah, she was.
- She really was.

06:57.689 --> 07:01.068
No. My mom is not the only person
in my family who has great ideas.

07:01.151 --> 07:03.487
I think she is.

07:03.570 --> 07:06.031
- No.
- They agree.

07:06.115 --> 07:10.660
Oh, yeah? Well, get ready...
because I have an idea.

07:11.954 --> 07:12.829
Oh, boy!

07:14.957 --> 07:18.543
Hand sanitizer. Bananas? Used tissues?

07:18.627 --> 07:20.170
No.

07:21.838 --> 07:23.340
Is it hair gel?

07:23.424 --> 07:25.509
- It's lube.
- Oh.

07:25.592 --> 07:29.888
Vaginal lubricant.
Disgusting, right? Wrong.

07:29.972 --> 07:31.807
Eighty-four percent
of postmenopausal women

07:31.890 --> 07:33.725
find sex painful due to vaginal dryness.

07:33.809 --> 07:35.644
- Those women need our help.
- I'm sure they do,

07:35.727 --> 07:39.064
- but aren't we trying to skew younger?
- No. We're trying to make money,

07:39.148 --> 07:42.485
and there are twice as many dry
vaginas out there as there are wet ones,

07:42.567 --> 07:45.612
and not just old vaginas.
Young vaginas are dry, too.

07:45.695 --> 07:47.739
Personal lubricant is for everybody!

07:47.823 --> 07:50.075
But we are a beauty company...

07:50.159 --> 07:54.913
And, Erica, our customers have
vaginal dryness and/or vaginal atrophy.

07:54.997 --> 07:57.291
And we need to make that beautiful.

07:57.374 --> 07:59.502
Let's do an informal focus group.

07:59.584 --> 08:04.548
We're going to test drive this lube
and report back at our Friday meeting.

08:04.631 --> 08:05.715
Not how focus groups work.

08:05.799 --> 08:07.759
Well, that's why I called it informal.

08:07.843 --> 08:10.387
And I'm not currently seeing
anyone. Greg and I are off again.

08:10.471 --> 08:11.305
- Good!
- Tear.

08:11.388 --> 08:13.349
You could try Barry in
accounting. He's desperate.

08:13.432 --> 08:15.767
- [laughs] Yeah.
- [laughs] Barry.

08:15.851 --> 08:17.936
- Barry.
- That's not funny. He tries.

08:18.020 --> 08:19.980
- Okay. That dies here.
- Yeah.

08:20.063 --> 08:22.691
Question: who are you
going to be using it with?

08:22.774 --> 08:24.651
Adam, if it wasn't for
your gorgeous penmanship,

08:24.734 --> 08:26.487
I would have fired you a long time ago.

08:26.570 --> 08:29.365
Right. But then you would have hired
me back because you miss me too much.

08:29.448 --> 08:32.534
And then I would have fired you
again because it would be fun.

08:32.616 --> 08:34.077
Oh, guys, also this is edible.

08:34.160 --> 08:36.371
Oh. Well, in that case...

08:36.455 --> 08:40.208
Well, you're sure it's not
going to be weird with Robert?

08:40.292 --> 08:44.671
We have to tell him about us
sometime. Tonight seems as good as any.

08:44.754 --> 08:47.632
Well, I just think it's wonderful
you're helping him with his wedding.

08:47.716 --> 08:50.135
I mean, most married couples
when they split up, you know,

08:50.219 --> 08:52.637
they're at each other's throats.

08:52.721 --> 08:57.976
But the two of you are so good to
each other, it's... very admirable.

08:58.060 --> 09:02.647
Well, I'm just so happy
for him... and for Sol.

09:02.731 --> 09:04.816
And for gay people in general.

09:04.900 --> 09:08.153
All the new rights they're
enjoying, parades...

09:08.237 --> 09:09.696
[knock on door]

09:11.156 --> 09:13.576
- Okay?
- Yeah.

09:13.658 --> 09:15.118
[sighs]

09:17.829 --> 09:21.375
I'm so sorry, but the door
to the street was open.

09:21.458 --> 09:23.252
Frankie always forgets to lock it.

09:23.335 --> 09:25.962
- Hello. How are you?
- I'll get the book.

09:26.046 --> 09:27.756
- You're a lifesaver.
- Hey, Robert.

09:29.258 --> 09:33.011
- Guy? What are you doing here?
- Hi.

09:33.095 --> 09:35.180
Shouldn't you be rappelling
down a glacier somewhere?

09:35.264 --> 09:37.140
No, I'm here. In La Jolla.

09:37.224 --> 09:38.601
Why didn't you call me?

09:38.683 --> 09:42.979
- Well... I've been... busy.
- With what?

09:43.063 --> 09:46.900
With me, Robert. He's been busy with me.

09:48.068 --> 09:49.570
Ah...

09:51.696 --> 09:55.492
Oh. Oh. Ohh...

09:55.576 --> 09:58.495
- Wow.
- I've been meaning to tell you.

09:58.579 --> 10:01.498
Grace and I bumped into each
other about three weeks ago,

10:01.582 --> 10:05.168
- and since then it's just been...
- Magical.

10:05.252 --> 10:09.506
Life-affirming. Transformative.

10:11.216 --> 10:15.095
Yes. Well, I'm happy... for you... both.

10:15.178 --> 10:17.473
Oh, and Robert, I got the
invitation to your wedding,

10:17.556 --> 10:20.767
and I will be attending
with Guy as my plus one.

10:20.850 --> 10:21.977
Ah.

10:24.271 --> 10:27.441
- So maybe we could all get together.
- I would like that.

10:27.524 --> 10:28.525
[chuckles]

10:28.609 --> 10:30.735
- So I can call you and we can...
- We'll make plans.

10:30.819 --> 10:32.446
- Make a plan.
- Sure.

10:33.947 --> 10:36.866
I should go. Thank you.

10:38.201 --> 10:41.413
Yeah. I have to go now.
She's loaning me her book.

10:41.497 --> 10:43.248
I won't bore you with the details.

10:43.332 --> 10:48.462
It's not magical or
life-affirming or transformative.

10:48.545 --> 10:51.047
Robert. It's been great to see you.

10:51.131 --> 10:53.008
- You too, Guy. Bye.
- [Guy] Bye.

10:53.091 --> 10:55.010
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

10:56.470 --> 10:59.264
- Oh, that was fun.
- [laughs]

11:16.615 --> 11:20.076
To what do I owe this
lovely surprise visit?

11:20.160 --> 11:23.330
Well, I was in the 'hood. I thought
I'd return some of your things

11:23.413 --> 11:27.167
from the beach house since you so
sweetly brought me my bread maker.

11:27.250 --> 11:29.961
And I also baked you a loaf of bread.

11:30.045 --> 11:34.299
And made better. Non-dairy butter.

11:34.383 --> 11:37.678
- In the shape of a chicken.
- It's a rooster.

11:38.970 --> 11:42.057
- There's its
comb. - Ha-ha.

11:42.140 --> 11:46.269
And I'm also going to remind you
that you need to get a flu shot.

11:46.353 --> 11:50.440
And also to tell you that this
will be the last time I remind you,

11:50.524 --> 11:54.277
because we need to set boundaries
with each other going forward.

11:54.361 --> 11:57.989
Mmm. So good. Taste.

11:58.073 --> 12:00.200
Mm. [chuckles]

12:00.283 --> 12:04.747
- Mmm! I added extra salt.
- And it's perfect.

12:04.829 --> 12:06.039
Here, get the better.

12:09.376 --> 12:12.504
Oh, God. Don't stick a knife in
it. It's like a living creature.

12:12.588 --> 12:14.881
Maybe just a little bit of the tail.

12:14.964 --> 12:17.092
- Okay. What was I saying?
- Boundaries.

12:17.175 --> 12:20.136
Right! We need those, and
no more surprise visits.

12:20.220 --> 12:23.932
I realize that I did this
one, but we need to stop.

12:24.015 --> 12:27.185
Okay, but why did you
drive all the way here

12:27.269 --> 12:29.772
to bring me bread and better

12:29.854 --> 12:33.066
and a plate that technically
belongs to both of us?

12:33.149 --> 12:35.527
It's a sombrero platter.

12:36.861 --> 12:40.865
And it's all a cover to find out
why I'm not invited to your wedding.

12:42.158 --> 12:44.077
Damn, you're good.

12:44.160 --> 12:47.122
What are you talking about? Of
course you're invited to my wedding.

12:47.205 --> 12:49.165
- I am?
- Yeah.

12:49.249 --> 12:51.752
Well, Grace got an
invitation, but I didn't.

12:51.835 --> 12:54.421
Well, it's on its way.

12:56.548 --> 12:59.843
Well... good.

12:59.926 --> 13:01.010
[chuckles]

13:01.094 --> 13:03.138
- That's good.
- Yeah.

13:03.221 --> 13:05.890
- [cell phone chimes]
- Oh.

13:08.143 --> 13:11.438
[gasps] Oh, damn it. I forgot.

13:11.521 --> 13:13.022
Who's Jacob?

13:13.106 --> 13:15.484
Oh, he's this guy I've been dating.

13:15.567 --> 13:19.070
Well, not dating. Sort of seeing.

13:19.154 --> 13:21.657
Not seeing really,
either. It's more casual.

13:23.116 --> 13:25.577
No. Boundaries.

13:32.668 --> 13:34.043
That means he's typing.

13:34.127 --> 13:37.172
I know. I'm your ex, not Sol?

13:38.757 --> 13:40.717
You are my ex, Sol.

13:42.010 --> 13:44.012
- [phone beeps]
- Oh, sweet relief.

13:46.682 --> 13:49.559
Oh, I should have written
"Great" with an eight.

13:49.643 --> 13:51.353
Oh, next time.

13:51.436 --> 13:52.771
[phone beeps]

13:55.899 --> 14:00.028
- I can order now. It's just me.
- Certainly, sir.

14:01.822 --> 14:03.323
- [grunting softly]
- [tires squeal]

14:03.406 --> 14:04.783
- Oh!
- Whoo.

14:04.867 --> 14:06.951
I love driving fast. Was I going too fast?

14:07.035 --> 14:09.454
No. I love it when you drive fast.

14:09.538 --> 14:12.165
I don't know about that poor
squirrel back there, but...

14:12.248 --> 14:15.084
- Beep, beep! Beep, beep!
- There you go.

14:15.168 --> 14:18.004
- Sorry I'm late.
- [whispering] What is he doing here?

14:18.087 --> 14:21.132
Oh, I said we'd all get together,
so I figured why not today.

14:21.216 --> 14:22.718
Why? Is it a bad idea?

14:22.801 --> 14:24.803
No. Threesomes are great for golf.

14:24.887 --> 14:27.180
I'll lead us off.

14:27.263 --> 14:29.892
Somebody ran over a squirrel back there.

14:29.974 --> 14:31.393
Man!

14:34.354 --> 14:35.731
You look great, Guy.

14:35.814 --> 14:39.067
I feel like I'm back in college
watching you warm-up before the big game.

14:40.193 --> 14:42.111
Are you flirting with him?

14:42.195 --> 14:44.322
I'm reminiscing. He's my oldest friend.

14:44.406 --> 14:47.158
You sound like you're about to
run out there and braid his hair.

14:47.242 --> 14:48.451
He does have great hair.

14:48.535 --> 14:51.413
I'm not going to talk to you about men.

14:51.496 --> 14:53.206
Nobody's that evolved.

14:53.289 --> 14:54.541
Are you talking about me?

14:54.624 --> 14:57.502
Of course we're talking
about you, you silly man!

14:57.586 --> 14:58.461
[chuckles]

14:59.379 --> 15:00.881
[whispering] Why are you here?

15:00.964 --> 15:02.799
Did it ever occur to you for one second

15:02.883 --> 15:05.886
that I'm not okay with
you being here today?

15:05.969 --> 15:07.763
Well, in the first place, no.

15:07.846 --> 15:10.766
In the second place, he said
that you told him we were fine

15:10.849 --> 15:15.270
and that you liked parades, so
I'm completely confused, Grace.

15:15.353 --> 15:16.939
Are we fine, are we not fine?

15:17.021 --> 15:20.442
If you said so, then I assume that we are.

15:21.276 --> 15:25.614
Holy shit! Oh, yeah! That's good!

15:25.697 --> 15:29.033
- What a great golfer you are!
- Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

15:29.117 --> 15:31.411
- Wasn't that nice?
- Yes!

15:31.494 --> 15:33.663
- Great drive, my friend.
- Aw, thanks.

15:33.747 --> 15:36.625
- Still going. [laughs]
- I couldn't even follow it.

15:36.708 --> 15:38.627
Aw, this is love, isn't it?

15:38.710 --> 15:42.088
To fly towards a secret sky.

15:42.171 --> 15:44.925
To cause a hundred veils
to fall each moment.

15:45.926 --> 15:51.306
First, to let go of life and
finally to take a step without feet.

15:51.389 --> 15:52.891
What?

15:52.975 --> 15:55.560
- Rumi.
- [chuckles]

15:55.644 --> 15:57.687
It's... It's beautiful.

15:57.771 --> 15:59.606
Well, I was thinking about using it.

15:59.689 --> 16:01.316
You just did.

16:01.399 --> 16:02.818
No, I mean at the wedding.

16:02.901 --> 16:05.445
I've been asked to officiate
at Robert and Sol's wedding.

16:05.528 --> 16:09.532
I mean, my gosh, how perfect is that?

16:09.616 --> 16:11.034
Uh-huh.

16:11.117 --> 16:13.745
I was telling Guy that we
did not have an officiant yet,

16:13.829 --> 16:18.458
and he told me he's performed weddings
all over the world, and you know,

16:18.541 --> 16:22.253
Sol wanted a pan-cultural ceremony, so...

16:22.337 --> 16:23.630
I offered.

16:23.713 --> 16:25.882
- And you accepted.
- Well, of course. What else could I do?

16:25.966 --> 16:30.595
Sol said it was bashert.
That means "meant to be".

16:30.679 --> 16:33.015
I'm learning some Yiddish.

16:33.097 --> 16:34.307
You're butchering it.

16:34.390 --> 16:38.061
Hey, I have an idea. Why don't
we walk the entire course, hm?

16:38.144 --> 16:39.604
Are you kidding?

16:39.688 --> 16:41.690
- Yes, I am kidding!
- [laughter]

16:41.773 --> 16:45.527
Among us we have three good
knees, so I say, to the carts!

16:45.610 --> 16:46.862
I'll drive.

16:48.363 --> 16:50.365
- [grunts]
- [tires squeal]

16:57.372 --> 16:59.374
We need to get a stamp, Barry.

16:59.457 --> 17:02.002
Then what if I ran off and had
tons of fun with your identity?

17:02.085 --> 17:05.463
Well, good luck having tons
of fun with my identity.

17:05.547 --> 17:08.008
Hey, I was an only child. I used
to have fun with a role of tape.

17:08.090 --> 17:10.760
- I called him "Tapey".
- [giggles]

17:10.844 --> 17:15.138
- Barry, you're funny for an accountant.
- Yeah. The bar's pretty low.

17:19.685 --> 17:20.936
How long have you worked here?

17:21.021 --> 17:24.773
Uh... nine... hundred years.

17:24.858 --> 17:27.569
So you were here when
Sharon had that breakdown.

17:27.652 --> 17:29.905
[laughs] Yeah, she had it on my desk.

17:29.988 --> 17:33.449
But it's all good because she's
doing great now and I got a new desk.

17:33.533 --> 17:36.703
You're a glass half-full
person, aren't you, Barry?

17:36.786 --> 17:38.287
I try. I really do.

17:40.082 --> 17:43.585
Did you really tell everybody
they had to go home and use lube?

17:43.668 --> 17:45.378
- That is so...
- Inappropriate.

17:45.461 --> 17:47.171
Awesome.

17:47.255 --> 17:50.008
Well, I have leftovers
if you want to try some.

17:50.092 --> 17:52.635
No, no. I don't have anyone to use it with.

17:52.719 --> 17:55.263
- You don't have a girlfriend?
- Nope.

17:55.346 --> 17:57.473
Well, you need to get one, Barry.

17:57.557 --> 18:00.810
I think I'm trying to get one right now.

18:04.981 --> 18:06.066
Oh.

18:13.156 --> 18:15.199
- What are you looking for?
- Frankie's invitation.

18:15.283 --> 18:17.827
- I mailed it.
- She didn't get it.

18:17.911 --> 18:20.747
Well, maybe you should take that
up with the US Postal Service.

18:20.830 --> 18:23.041
If you make this about the
United States Postal Service...

18:23.125 --> 18:24.584
They have been known to make mistakes.

18:24.667 --> 18:27.129
Perhaps because they're
drastically underfunded.

18:27.211 --> 18:29.255
Which is why privatization
more than makes sense.

18:29.338 --> 18:31.215
I'm not having this
argument with you again.

18:31.299 --> 18:32.717
Then why did you start it?

18:32.801 --> 18:34.469
I just think it's odd that the only person

18:34.552 --> 18:37.346
who didn't get an invitation
to our wedding is Frankie.

18:37.430 --> 18:40.308
I mailed her invitation. If you
want, we can send her another one,

18:40.391 --> 18:42.811
- but I don't like what you're implying.
- I'm not implying.

18:42.894 --> 18:45.939
I'm postulating that
you passive-aggressively

18:46.022 --> 18:50.068
and accidentally on purpose forgot
to send Frankie an invitation.

18:50.152 --> 18:52.779
Sol, may I ask you, please,

18:52.862 --> 18:55.698
why was Cousin Donald
invited to our wedding?

18:55.782 --> 18:59.869
And why is there wild salmon,
not farm-raised salmon,

18:59.953 --> 19:01.955
but wild salmon, on the
menu, but no red meat?

19:02.038 --> 19:04.833
And why did we need to
find a DJ who would play

19:04.916 --> 19:09.171
not only oldies but goodies, but oldies
with a positive earth-centric message?

19:09.253 --> 19:10.672
- For me.
- No, for Frankie.

19:10.755 --> 19:13.091
We have been arguing and
fighting about her for months,

19:13.175 --> 19:16.136
and now you think I would purposely
not invite her to our wedding

19:16.219 --> 19:19.639
and that somehow you
would magically not notice!

19:19.722 --> 19:24.560
All I know is you wouldn't be this mad
if you didn't feel guilty about something!

19:29.565 --> 19:35.738
I feel as if I'm flying towards
a secret sky without feet.

19:42.078 --> 19:43.205
What?!

19:43.287 --> 19:47.083
- I mean, it tingles.
- And the fragrance?

19:47.167 --> 19:50.670
Ugh! And the texture... Well,
wait, did you use it with Greg?

19:50.753 --> 19:52.839
Yes. We're getting back together.

19:52.922 --> 19:54.507
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, my God!

19:54.590 --> 19:56.634
[Erica] I know, I know. But
there must be coconut in it

19:56.718 --> 19:59.303
because my vagina swelled up
which Greg actually really liked,

19:59.387 --> 20:01.389
but then we did other stuff
and my throat closed up.

20:01.472 --> 20:05.434
Okay, now your mouth's gonna
close up. And you, young lady?

20:05.518 --> 20:10.690
I actually used it on myself,
and I agree. It's amazing.

20:10.773 --> 20:14.736
Oh, you are so full of shit.
You did not use it on yourself.

20:14.819 --> 20:16.529
Why? Who'd you use it with?

20:16.612 --> 20:19.657
Uh, my friend Eric and then
my ex John and then Eric again.

20:19.741 --> 20:21.243
It's a long story. Your turn.

20:21.325 --> 20:24.871
It's not who you used it with,
it's what you thought of it. So...

20:29.959 --> 20:31.419
[clears throat]

20:36.883 --> 20:38.885
You know, Barry went to Stanford.

20:38.968 --> 20:43.139
You know, I don't care about stupid
Barry. Who was inside of you last night?

20:44.640 --> 20:46.893
This is harder than you said it would be.

20:46.976 --> 20:49.896
Fold the corners. No.
Fold, fold the corners.

20:49.979 --> 20:52.065
They're round. They do not fold.

20:52.148 --> 20:54.650
Anyone who can do this is a powerful witch.

20:54.734 --> 20:56.986
- Well, I can do it.
- I rest my case.

20:57.070 --> 21:00.406
You know, if this sheet could
talk, you know what it would say,

21:00.489 --> 21:04.244
"I fold myself into very
special shapes for you, Guy.

21:04.327 --> 21:08.706
It doesn't feel very good, but I
don't let it stop me. I'm used to it."

21:08.790 --> 21:11.334
Give it to me. God.

21:11.417 --> 21:13.669
I don't fold myself into anything.

21:13.753 --> 21:16.923
Except maybe a golfer... a hoagie-lover...

21:17.006 --> 21:19.884
Since when did you become
such an expert on men?

21:19.968 --> 21:22.845
Well, I've been juggling a couple
of them right now quite deftly.

21:22.929 --> 21:24.513
I set boundaries with Sol.

21:24.597 --> 21:27.934
I screwed up a lunch with
Jacob, but we rescheduled.

21:28.017 --> 21:31.354
When you're in a new relationship
with someone you care about

21:31.437 --> 21:33.648
and you want them to be happy,

21:33.731 --> 21:37.360
you lie... to keep them happy.

21:37.443 --> 21:39.154
What are you so afraid of?

21:39.237 --> 21:42.240
I'm afraid that if I don't do
the things that Guy loves to do

21:42.324 --> 21:46.244
that he'll find someone else who
will, and in my mind her name is Dahlia

21:46.328 --> 21:49.998
and she has a long neck and
dark hair and very green eyes.

21:50.081 --> 21:52.834
- Really? Dahlia, that's your reason?
- Yeah.

21:52.917 --> 21:55.753
You know what my Aunt Jennifer always said?

21:55.837 --> 21:58.173
"Tha sou gamiso to hotio."

21:59.299 --> 22:00.925
Well, that sounds nice, what does it mean?

22:01.009 --> 22:03.427
It means, "I fuck your village."

22:03.511 --> 22:05.638
I don't know why, but
it always hit the spot.

22:05.721 --> 22:07.098
- [door shuts]
- [Guy] Hello. I'm home.

22:07.182 --> 22:09.934
Ah, there he is. Go talk to him right now.

22:10.018 --> 22:11.311
I can't right now. I'm folding.

22:11.394 --> 22:13.521
No. Folding, my foot.

22:13.604 --> 22:16.649
- Done. Go do it. Go on!
- [Guy] Anybody home?

22:16.732 --> 22:19.652
Or you'll be a hoagie-lover
all your life. [laughs]

22:20.945 --> 22:24.991
Hey, gorgeous! Hey, Frankie, you want fish?

22:25.074 --> 22:26.868
This is not about me!

22:26.951 --> 22:29.162
Well, I got clams. Hey, do you like clams?

22:29.245 --> 22:30.538
Oh, they're my favorite!

22:30.621 --> 22:31.914
Nah...

22:33.708 --> 22:35.126
What is that?

22:35.210 --> 22:40.589
That's Frankie reminding me to
remind myself that I don't like clams.

22:40.673 --> 22:41.590
Ding-ding-ding-ding!

22:41.674 --> 22:43.343
Is she gonna keep doing that?

22:43.426 --> 22:46.388
Yeah, probably. Guy, there's
something I have to tell you.

22:47.471 --> 22:49.724
Robert and I are not okay together.

22:49.807 --> 22:52.935
I am not okay with you
officiating his wedding.

22:53.019 --> 22:54.896
I hate hoagies.

22:54.979 --> 22:57.732
I hate all sandwiches made of mystery meat.

22:57.815 --> 22:59.942
And I hate golf. I hate
everything about it.

23:00.026 --> 23:03.238
I hate the grass. I hate the carts.
I hate the seats on the carts.

23:03.321 --> 23:05.531
My ass gets sweaty.

23:05.614 --> 23:09.827
- And I really hate swimming.
- Well, I didn't ask you to go swimming.

23:09.911 --> 23:13.164
Well, I know. Just telling you.

23:13.248 --> 23:16.042
Okay. Then why didn't
you say something before?

23:16.125 --> 23:18.420
I don't know. I didn't know how.

23:19.921 --> 23:22.257
Especially to somebody I really like.

23:24.717 --> 23:29.097
Okay. So... you really like me?

23:30.098 --> 23:31.724
I think I do.

23:33.351 --> 23:34.894
- Yeah.
- Oh...

23:38.814 --> 23:39.982
[exhales deeply]

23:41.109 --> 23:43.652
- Anything else?
- Count me in for fish!

23:53.913 --> 23:59.001
- Oh, we said no more surprise visits.
- This is the last one, I swear to God.

23:59.085 --> 24:00.086
Which God?

24:00.169 --> 24:02.922
Whichever one you're on good
terms with at the moment.

24:03.005 --> 24:07.218
I've had a couple of good talks
with the Hawaiian God Kanaloa.

24:09.011 --> 24:10.346
I have something for you.

24:10.430 --> 24:14.725
I apologize that you didn't get
yours when everybody else got theirs.

24:14.809 --> 24:19.063
It's okay. Not like I prepared
an interpretive dance or anything.

24:19.147 --> 24:20.982
I'm sorry.

24:21.983 --> 24:25.278
If it makes you feel any better,
Robert and I had a huge fight about it.

24:25.361 --> 24:27.196
No, it doesn't make me feel any better.

24:28.739 --> 24:31.993
It would have been better if I'd
gotten mine when Grace got hers.

24:35.079 --> 24:36.164
Um...

24:38.541 --> 24:39.750
Frankie.

24:43.129 --> 24:47.049
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, boy is right.

24:47.133 --> 24:49.344
Robert's gonna kill me.

24:49.427 --> 24:52.263
And I should probably let him.

24:52.347 --> 24:55.308
I'm so embarrassed.

24:55.391 --> 24:58.353
Don't be. Anybody could
have made that mistake.

24:59.395 --> 25:01.730
What am I gonna do about your wedding?

25:01.814 --> 25:04.150
- It can't be easy for you.
- It's not.

25:05.234 --> 25:07.111
I got so caught up in not being invited,

25:07.195 --> 25:11.240
I never thought about whether
I actually wanted to go.

25:11.324 --> 25:12.783
[Sol] Do you?

25:12.867 --> 25:15.703
I... I think I should.

25:15.786 --> 25:19.748
- That's not what I asked.
- I think you want me to.

25:19.832 --> 25:23.002
Also, not what I asked.

25:23.085 --> 25:25.547
Have you checked in with your subconscious?

25:25.629 --> 25:28.550
Oh, sure, Joanne? She'll have
a field day with this one.

25:29.925 --> 25:32.261
I should call her.

25:32.345 --> 25:34.055
Hi, Joanne?

25:34.138 --> 25:35.973
What is she saying?

25:40.228 --> 25:43.689
Oh, Sol, I don't want
to go to your wedding.

25:44.690 --> 25:47.318
It'll be too painful.

25:49.153 --> 25:50.363
Oh.

25:51.822 --> 25:55.493
Wow. All right.

25:56.994 --> 25:59.247
I guess that makes sense.

26:02.250 --> 26:05.044
Maybe I should get in touch
with my subconscious, too.

26:06.879 --> 26:09.006
[crying] What is Armando saying?

26:10.132 --> 26:12.843
That I'm feeling pretty divided lately.

26:12.927 --> 26:16.972
When I'm with Robert, I... worry about you.

26:17.056 --> 26:21.310
When I'm with you, I worry about
Robert. I can't be in two places at once.

26:26.148 --> 26:28.692
You're right about setting boundaries,

26:28.776 --> 26:32.196
and... we need to do divorce things

26:32.280 --> 26:35.617
like sign papers and...

26:35.699 --> 26:37.285
move out of our house.

26:40.288 --> 26:42.039
It's time.

26:43.249 --> 26:44.667
Joanne agrees.

26:46.502 --> 26:48.630
[cell phone chimes]

26:51.215 --> 26:52.341
Oh, shit!

26:58.931 --> 27:02.059
Oh, I'm late. It's my fault.

27:03.018 --> 27:05.104
I ran.

27:05.187 --> 27:07.398
Bad shape.

27:07.482 --> 27:11.235
They felt so bad that I got stood up
again, they gave me free cheesecake.

27:11.319 --> 27:13.070
Oh, I'm sorry.

27:13.154 --> 27:16.658
I just had a pretty
intense realization with Sol

27:16.740 --> 27:19.201
which led to an avalanche
of ah-ha moments.

27:20.286 --> 27:23.498
Ah, slow down. I'll get
some cheesecake, too.

27:23.581 --> 27:28.210
- That's okay. I was just finishing.
- Oh, no. Please, I feel terrible.

27:28.294 --> 27:32.756
[sighs] Look, I get it. I do.

27:32.840 --> 27:37.261
But I kind of got this thing about
being stood up twice in one week.

27:37.345 --> 27:39.472
Why don't you call me when
you guys figure things out?

27:39.555 --> 27:42.850
Oh, but we have figured things out.

27:42.933 --> 27:44.226
I think, I don't know.

27:44.310 --> 27:48.939
It's my subconscious. She's a mess.
I need to figure things out with her.

27:53.861 --> 27:55.946
Let me know when you do.

28:03.371 --> 28:05.331
[door opens]

28:05.414 --> 28:08.042
- Robert?
- Come in.

28:08.125 --> 28:10.211
Guy is not your minister.

28:10.294 --> 28:13.339
He is my boyfriend, and
my date at your wedding...

28:13.422 --> 28:15.383
Your big, fat, gay wedding.

28:15.466 --> 28:17.134
Oh. Okay.

28:17.218 --> 28:20.888
Have you stormed into other homes in
the neighborhood to say that to people?

28:20.971 --> 28:23.182
This is not a joke, Robert.

28:23.265 --> 28:25.685
So are we clear about
Guy's role at your wedding?

28:25.768 --> 28:29.355
We are. Who gives a shit anymore?

28:29.438 --> 28:32.567
- What?
- You can have your book back.

28:32.650 --> 28:34.610
I thought this was supposed
to be a happy thing.

28:34.694 --> 28:36.487
It's a nightmare. Everybody's mad.

28:36.571 --> 28:39.198
The invitations aren't
right. The food's not right.

28:39.281 --> 28:40.408
The bills are piling up.

28:40.491 --> 28:42.493
Now, of course, we have
to find a new officiant.

28:42.577 --> 28:44.662
This wedding's nothing
but a pain in the ass.

28:44.746 --> 28:47.122
Robert, that's what weddings are.

28:47.206 --> 28:51.419
If you'd taken any interest in ours
or our daughter's, you would know that.

28:51.502 --> 28:53.837
Maybe we should just elope.
Sol would be relieved.

28:53.921 --> 28:55.881
He didn't want a big
wedding in the first place.

28:55.964 --> 28:57.550
Well, what do you want?

28:57.633 --> 29:00.720
I want a big wedding in the first place.

29:00.803 --> 29:02.471
After hiding all those years,

29:02.555 --> 29:06.559
I want to get married in front
of everyone, including you.

29:06.642 --> 29:08.977
Then you should do that.

29:10.438 --> 29:14.942
I like this thing of us
saying exactly what we mean.

29:15.025 --> 29:19.238
I wonder if things would have been
different if we'd done it a long time ago.

29:20.448 --> 29:25.578
Probably not where we ended, but
getting there might have been better.

29:27.371 --> 29:28.664
Keep the book.

29:28.748 --> 29:33.669
And remember there'll always be
four more guests than have RSVP'd.

29:37.673 --> 29:39.508
That's good to know.

29:42.970 --> 29:46.890
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

29:46.974 --> 29:50.352
I'm the worst fiancé that ever lived.

29:51.895 --> 29:53.481
[scoffs] Oh.

29:54.690 --> 29:57.318
- What did she do to it?
- Collage.

30:01.739 --> 30:05.743
- Can you ever forgive me?
- I think so.

30:10.956 --> 30:13.542
I read in Young Bride magazine
that planning a wedding

30:13.626 --> 30:15.961
can be harder than the
first year of marriage.

30:16.044 --> 30:20.007
- You read Young Bride?
- When you leave it in the bathroom.

30:21.300 --> 30:24.720
[both laugh]

30:26.430 --> 30:30.559
[Grace] "This is love. To
fly toward a secret sky.

30:30.643 --> 30:34.396
To cause a hundred veils
to fall each moment.

30:34.480 --> 30:36.774
First, to let go of life.

30:36.858 --> 30:40.736
Finally, to take a step without feet."

30:41.945 --> 30:46.492
It's official. I hate poetry.
I'd rather read my divorce papers.

30:46.575 --> 30:50.204
You'll get the opportunity
when we sign them.

30:50.287 --> 30:54.333
It took me 45 fucking
minutes, but I did it.

30:54.416 --> 30:57.961
- Congratulations!
- Thank you. [chuckles]

31:01.215 --> 31:03.676
Never doing it again.
