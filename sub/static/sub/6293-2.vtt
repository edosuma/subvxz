YOU KNOW THAT BAD SURPRISES
ARE A TRIGGER FOR HER.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.725
OH, I'M SORRY.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.727
I GUESS I SHOULD'VE LET
THAT FERTILIZED EGG

00:27.928 --> 00:29.230

00:33.501 --> 00:35.203
THIS IS YOUR WIFE'S BODY.

00:35.236 --> 00:36.470
JUST 'CAUSE I'M NOT HER,

DOESN'T MEAN
WE CAN'T HOOK UP.

00:38.439 --> 00:39.840
OKAY, WE MADE OUT
A LITTLE BIT.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.142
I CAN'T HELP IT--WHAT THE FUCK
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

00:41.175 --> 00:42.543
SHE LOOKS JUST LIKE YOU.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.812
THEY'RE REALLY LUCKY.
WE'RE LUCKY, MOM.

WE GET TO BE INTERESTING.

00:47.815 --> 00:50.651
(Charmaine)
IT IS REALLY HARD FOR ME
TO SEE MY SISTER LIKE THAT.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.220

EVEN A REAL DISEASE, MAX.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.354

ONLY YOU'RE PASSED OUT COLD,

THIS FAMILY MEETING
IS CALLED TO ORDER.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.398
I LIKE
TO CALL THEM SUMMITS.

02:44.432 --> 02:47.335
SOUNDS MORE GLOBAL,
ALMOST SWISS.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.972
OKAY, SO, UH,
FRIDAY AFTERNOON,

02:52.005 --> 02:53.207
I BELIEVE T WAS
IN HERE, RIGHT?

02:53.241 --> 02:55.075
[snorts]

02:55.108 --> 02:56.244
THAT WAS
DEFINITELY T-TIME.

02:56.277 --> 02:58.579
IN WHICH CASE,
WE NEED TO TALK

02:58.612 --> 03:01.815
ABOUT SOME MYSTERIOUS CHARGES
ON MY CREDIT CARD.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.784
HMM.

03:03.817 --> 03:06.354
WHAT?

03:06.387 --> 03:08.088
OR I COULD LOOK UP
THE STATEMENT

03:08.121 --> 03:09.290
AND SEE WHAT T
AND HER "FRIEND"

03:09.323 --> 03:11.191
SPENT MY MONEY ON.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.028
[sighs]
OKAY, SO I GOT
SOME SKANK SHIRTS

03:15.062 --> 03:16.497
AT THAT DEAD MALL
IN GRANDVIEW.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.965
BUT I DIDN'T
TAKE OFF THE TAGS,

03:17.998 --> 03:19.633
SO I'LL RETURN THEM,
OKAY?

03:23.003 --> 03:25.439
AND I GOT A KNOCK-OFF
CHINESE GUCCI ASS-PACK...

03:27.007 --> 03:28.342
AND SOME CIGARETTES,

03:28.376 --> 03:30.678
WHICH I DID NOT SMOKE
BECAUSE T GETS MENTHOLS,

03:30.711 --> 03:32.212
AND I THINK THOSE
MAKE YOUR LUNGS BLEED.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.947
AND I ALSO THINK
THEY'RE RACIST.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.416
WOW.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.019
I NEED MY OWN MONEY.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.888
OKAY, SO THEN I CAME BACK,

03:40.921 --> 03:43.090
AND THEN I WAS BUCK.

03:43.123 --> 03:44.258
THEN I KICKED SOME ASS.

03:44.292 --> 03:45.593
(Max)
OH, YEAH...

03:45.626 --> 03:47.961
WELL, TECHNICALLY
BUCK KICKED SOME ASS.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.797

SO I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS
WENT BOWLING WITHOUT ME.

04:09.883 --> 04:12.786

'CAUSE BUCK HAS A THING

ANYWAY, I CAN'T--WE CAN'T
BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND

04:35.609 --> 04:36.744

04:36.777 --> 04:38.579
UNLESS WE LET THEM
SHOW THEMSELVES.

04:38.612 --> 04:42.450
YOU'RE RIGHT.
LOOK AT YOUR POOR EYE.

DON'T EVEN WANT ME AROUND

09:34.642 --> 09:36.476
WHEN I'M ME.
OH, PLEASE.

09:36.509 --> 09:39.346
IT'S ALL YOU.

09:39.379 --> 09:42.816
PLUS, HE WET THE BED.

09:42.850 --> 09:45.352
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
LIKE, HE PEED THE BED?

09:45.385 --> 09:47.554
LIKE,
BABY GOO-GOO-GA-GA?

09:47.587 --> 09:49.757
OR WET THE BED,
LIKE A BIG BOY.

09:49.790 --> 09:52.125
HE URINATED IN BED,
CHARMAINE.

09:52.159 --> 09:54.127
HE USED TO DO IT
ALL THE TIME WHEN HE WAS A KID,

09:54.161 --> 09:56.096
BUT HE HASN'T DONE IT
SINCE HE WAS, LIKE, 11.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.298
AND KATE...

09:58.331 --> 10:00.000
I DON'T KNOW
WHO SHE'S BECOMING.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.101
[sighs]

10:01.134 --> 10:03.637
MAYBE THE KIDS
ARE RESPONDING TO TRAUMA.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.840
WHAT TRAUMA?

10:06.874 --> 10:09.476
YOU KNOW,
YOUR SCHIZOPHRENIA...

10:09.509 --> 10:10.911
SITUATION.

10:10.944 --> 10:14.147
[scoffs]
OKAY, LET ME EXPLAIN AGAIN.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.616
SCHIZOPHRENIA IS
WHEN YOU HEAR VOICES,

10:16.650 --> 10:19.219
LIKE THE RADIO PEOPLE.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.254
I DON'T HAVE THAT.
I DON'T HEAR VOICES.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.523
RIGHT, YOU DO
THE WHOLE CHARACTER.

10:23.556 --> 10:24.992
I WANT TO GET SOMETHING
FOR KATE.

10:25.025 --> 10:29.162
MAYBE I SHOULD GET HER
ONE OF THOSE.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.931
SHE CAN WEAR IT
WHILE HAVING UNPROTECTED SEX.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.100
SPICE THINGS UP A BIT.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.534
YEAH.

10:34.567 --> 10:35.803
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED?

10:35.836 --> 10:37.805
IT BETTER NOT BE VITAMINS.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.572
NO, THESE ARE NOT
JUST VITAMINS.

10:39.606 --> 10:41.274
OKAY, THIS IS A PRODUCT
I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE IN.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.310
OTHERWISE, I WOULDN'T BE
A LEVEL-TWO SALES REP.

10:43.343 --> 10:46.079
THIS IS VITA-SELF'S
MOOD-BOOSTER REMIX.

10:46.113 --> 10:47.380
OKAY, IT'S
A LITTLE DRINK YOU DO

10:47.414 --> 10:49.416
ONCE IN THE MORNING,
TWICE IN THE EVENING,

10:49.449 --> 10:52.219
WITH LIKE A SALTWATER FLUSH.

10:52.252 --> 10:53.821
YOU KNOW.

10:53.854 --> 10:56.656
SOUNDS GREAT.

10:56.690 --> 10:59.292
BUT I'D JUST RATHER NOT...

10:59.326 --> 11:00.360
FLUSH.

11:00.393 --> 11:01.628
SORRY.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.596
BUY SOME,
AND HELP ME OUT A LITTLE.

11:03.630 --> 11:06.734
HELP OUT YOUR COLON.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.603
HEY, LET'S GO
TO MACAW ISLAND THIS WEEKEND.

11:10.637 --> 11:12.105
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

11:12.139 --> 11:13.841
COME ON, MAN, THE BEACH BOYS
ARE PLAYING

11:13.874 --> 11:15.542
WITHOUT ANY
OF THE ACTUAL BEACH BOYS.

11:15.575 --> 11:17.210
IF I WANT TO WITNESS
A SAD DECLINE,

11:17.244 --> 11:19.446
I'LL JUST TAKE A LOOK
AT MY OWN LIFE.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.314
THANK YOU.

11:21.348 --> 11:25.685
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG SINCE WE DID
ANY INTENSE MANLY STUFF.

11:25.719 --> 11:26.854
YOU KNOW?

11:26.887 --> 11:28.756
ALL WE DO NOW
IS SHOVEL DIRT

11:28.789 --> 11:30.724
AND NURSE TREES AND SHIT.

11:30.758 --> 11:33.626
WE'RE LANDSCAPERS, ASSHOLE.

11:33.660 --> 11:35.262
YEAH,
WE 'SCAPE THE LAND,

11:35.295 --> 11:37.030
BUT I MEAN,
WE CAN'T LET THAT DEFINE US.

11:37.064 --> 11:39.867
I MEAN, LOOK--WE USED
TO WORK THE LAND IN OUR 20s,

11:39.900 --> 11:41.168
BUT, MAN, WE DID IT DRUNK.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.603
LET'S GO TO MACAW ISLAND,

11:43.636 --> 11:45.172
AND SPEND SOME MONEY.

11:45.205 --> 11:48.876
GET SOME OF THOSE LITTLE,
YOU KNOW, BAYOU BREEZER DRINKS.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.978
MAYBE.
THAT SOUNDS GOOD, ACTUALLY.

11:51.011 --> 11:53.280
YOU GOING TO DO
ANY WORK HERE, OR WHAT?

11:53.313 --> 11:57.084
I'M MESMERIZED
BY YOUR ASS.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.352
THESE ARE BORING.
THESE'LL LOOK ALL RIGHT ON YOU.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.520
HEY, TARA.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.455
HI.
OH, HI!

12:02.489 --> 12:03.891
OH, WOW.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.859
SO YOU'RE--
YOU'RE OUT AND ABOUT, HUH?

12:05.893 --> 12:06.994
HOW ARE YOU?

12:07.027 --> 12:09.763
GOOD. YEAH, GOOD.
HOW ARE YOU GUYS?

12:09.797 --> 12:11.264
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT YOU.

12:11.298 --> 12:13.366
OH, MY GOD.
I COMPLETELY FORGOT.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.368
I WAS GOING TO MAKE
A CAKE FOR THE BAKE SALE.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.303
I'M SORRY.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.171
FOR THE CLEFT PALATE KIDS
IN BRAZIL.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.407
NO, NOT THAT. I DIDN'T EVEN
REALLY COUNT ON IT.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.642
I MEAN, YOU JUST HAVE
SO MUCH ON YOUR PLATE,

12:22.675 --> 12:25.178
WHAT WITH THAT BROUHAHA
WITH KATIE'S BOYFRIEND.

12:25.212 --> 12:26.947
HE'S NOT
HER BOYFRIEND.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.648
HOOKUP.
WHATEVER.

12:28.681 --> 12:31.651
ALL RIGHT, THAT BENJAMIN
IS AN ABUSIVE LITTLE SHIT,

12:31.684 --> 12:33.921
WHO DISRESPECTS YOUNG LADIES,
WHILE WEARING EYELINER.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.789
WE GOTTA GO.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.557
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU, TARA.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.426
GET SOME REST,
TARA.

12:39.459 --> 12:42.062
TARA, YOU JUST
STAND THERE AND TAKE IT.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.530
YEAH, I KNOW--
I CAN'T--

12:43.563 --> 12:45.765
I MEAN, I FEEL
LIKE WE'RE TEN AGAIN.

12:45.799 --> 12:50.703
OKAY, OKAY, O--

12:50.737 --> 12:53.040
TARA?

12:53.073 --> 12:55.475
[light, airy voice]
WHAT A MARVELOUS SHADE.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.046
OH, FUCK.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.548
DON'T LET GERSHENOFF
INTIMIDATE YOU.

13:01.581 --> 13:04.317
I MEAN, THE MAN HAS A B.A.
FROM A STATE SCHOOL.

13:04.351 --> 13:05.318
I GUESS.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.720
BESIDES, LIKE,
WHAT CAN HE DO?

13:07.754 --> 13:10.357
LIKE, RUN CRYING
TO PRINCIPAL FRANKEL

13:10.390 --> 13:12.792
JUST BECAUSE YOU POINTED OUT
SOME SEX IN A NOVEL?

13:12.826 --> 13:16.096
UGH, I CAN'T STAND
THESE CONSERVATIVE BED WETTERS.

13:17.965 --> 13:19.166
WHAT'S WRONG?

13:19.199 --> 13:20.233
NOTHING.

13:20.267 --> 13:21.801
I APPRECIATE
YOUR CONCERN, PETULA.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.837
WELL, YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH I CARE.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.505
YEAH.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.010
HEY, I GOT TO HIT
THAT PARENT-TEACHER CONFERENCE,

13:30.043 --> 13:32.412
SO KEEP AN EYE OUT ON THINGS
WHILE I'M GONE, OKAY?

13:32.445 --> 13:35.082
HEY, WHAT IF ONE OF THESE GUYS
ASKS ME A QUESTION, MAN?

13:35.115 --> 13:37.350
I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH.
[car door closes]

13:37.384 --> 13:39.252
WHAT IF THE, UH--
WHAT IF THE OWNERS COME HOME?

13:39.286 --> 13:41.588
OR WHAT IF I START DOING
A BUNCH OF EXTRA WORK

13:41.621 --> 13:43.323
THAT ISN'T IN YOUR BID?

13:43.356 --> 13:45.392
AH, YOU WERE GOING TO DO
A BUNCH OF EXTRA WORK?

13:45.425 --> 13:48.761
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M--I'M LOOKING OUT FOR YOU.

13:48.795 --> 13:50.297
OKAY?

13:50.330 --> 13:53.200
I THINK IT'S UNFAIR YOU GOT
TO DO ALL THE WORK.

13:53.233 --> 13:54.667
CAN'T TARA DO SOME OF IT?

13:54.701 --> 13:55.735
LATER.

13:55.768 --> 13:58.939
GOD, YOU'RE SO CODEPENDENT.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.573
[engine turning]

14:00.607 --> 14:01.808
IT'S CALLED LOVE, BRO.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.710
CALLED LOVE.
YEAH, OKAY.

14:03.743 --> 14:05.178
THAT'S NOT BAD.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.346
[sighs]

14:06.379 --> 14:07.915
IT'S WHO YOU ARE, MAXWELL.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.350
THANK JESUS TOO,
MAN, I'M ALWAYS LATE,

14:10.383 --> 14:11.418
USUALLY STONED.

14:11.451 --> 14:14.421
[dainty music]

14:14.454 --> 14:20.460
*

14:37.110 --> 14:38.478
I KNOW.
I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED.

14:39.846 --> 14:42.649
HELLO, LAURIE, BETH.
I'M ALICE.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.685
RIGHT, ALICE.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.922
I BROUGHT MY CAKE
FOR THE BRAZILIAN KIDS.
WOW.

14:48.956 --> 14:50.657
THAT IS...ELABORATE.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.960
I'M SURE YOU'LL FIGURE OUT
WHERE TO PUT IT.

14:52.993 --> 14:56.663
YOU COULD MOVE WHATEVER
THAT IS.

14:56.696 --> 14:58.431
SO LONG.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.300
EW. IS THAT A--

15:00.333 --> 15:02.635
WELL, I'M SORRY IF MARSHALL
FEELS THAT WAY.

15:02.669 --> 15:05.738
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT PERSONAL
ON MY END.

15:05.772 --> 15:07.474
THERE'S A CURRICULUM
THAT I HAVE TO FOLLOW.

15:07.507 --> 15:08.841
WE'RE--WE'RE NOT
IN VERMONT.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.710
YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

15:10.743 --> 15:14.181
YEAH.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.615
I-I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU...

15:15.648 --> 15:18.351
HAVE AN ODD FAMILY SITUATION,
MR. GREGSON.

15:18.385 --> 15:21.188
BUT IN MY CLASSROOM,
THAT MAKES MARSHALL

15:21.221 --> 15:25.092
NEITHER MORE INTERESTING,
NOR MORE SUPERIOR,

15:25.125 --> 15:27.260
ALTHOUGH HE SEEMS TO THINK
IT DOES.

15:27.294 --> 15:30.463
(Max)
WELL, WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE
TO AGREE TO DISAGREE,

15:30.497 --> 15:32.465
BECAUSE TO ME, THAT SOUNDS
PRETTY FUCKING PERSONAL.

15:32.499 --> 15:35.668
[clears throat]
KNOCK, KNOCK.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.570
ROOM FOR ONE MORE?

15:37.604 --> 15:39.839
UM...
[clears throat]

15:39.872 --> 15:41.641
UM, I'M OKAY.

15:41.674 --> 15:42.742
I GOT THIS COVERED.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.144
WELL, I WON'T BE
BUT A MINUTE.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.313
I CAME BY TO DROP OFF
SOME TREATS FOR THE BAKE SALE

15:46.346 --> 15:48.015
AND FIGURED
WHILE I WAS HERE,

15:48.048 --> 15:49.516
I'D POP IN AND MEET
MY BOY'S TEACHER.

15:49.549 --> 15:52.152
MR. GERSHENOFF,
IT IS SUCH A PLEASURE.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.355
THANK YOU.

15:55.388 --> 15:56.456
[giggles]

15:56.489 --> 15:59.026
WE'RE SO VERY WORRIED
ABOUT OUR MARSHALL.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.461
SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED?

16:01.494 --> 16:03.796
UH, MARSHALL'S
A UNIQUE CHALLENGE.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.932
WHAT ABOUT YOUR CHALLENGES?

16:05.965 --> 16:07.534
I'M SORRY?

16:07.567 --> 16:09.502
OH, MR. GERSHENOFF
FEELS SO FORMAL.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.638
MAY I CALL YOU
BY YOUR FIRST NAME?

16:11.671 --> 16:13.473
WHAT IS YOUR FIRST NAME?

16:13.506 --> 16:16.476
OREL.

16:17.810 --> 16:21.081
MR. GERSHENOFF, WE ALL KNOW
WHAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT--

16:21.114 --> 16:23.316
BEING DIFFERENT.

16:23.350 --> 16:26.919
AND YOU, OUT OF ANYONE,
MUST UNDERSTAND.

16:26.953 --> 16:28.455
POOR LITTLE OREL GERSHENOFF,

16:28.488 --> 16:29.989
SITTING IN THE BACK
OF THE CLASS,

16:30.023 --> 16:32.692
WITH HIS FUNNY HAIR
AND HIS FUNNY NAME,

16:32.725 --> 16:36.396
DAYDREAMING ABOUT SPORTS
HE'D NEVER PLAY

16:36.429 --> 16:39.332
AND GIRLS HE'D NEVER TOUCH,

16:39.366 --> 16:41.868
YOU KNOW, PANDERING
TO THE FOOTBALL CAPTAINS

16:41.901 --> 16:43.236
AND PROM QUEENS OF TODAY

16:43.270 --> 16:46.306
WON'T TAKE AWAY THE PAIN
OF YESTERDAY.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.441
THEY CAN'T APPRECIATE YOU NOW

16:48.475 --> 16:51.144
ANY MORE THAN THEY DID
BACK THEN.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.746
AND TAKING IT OUT
ON THE WEIRD KID....

16:53.780 --> 16:54.814
WON'T HELP THAT WEIRD KID

16:54.847 --> 16:57.584
IN THERE.

16:57.617 --> 17:00.287
IT'S TIME
TO START LOVING OREL.

17:06.059 --> 17:09.462
I NEVER MEANT
TO SINGLE MARSHALL OUT.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.131
[clears throat]
UM...

17:11.164 --> 17:13.366
I--I'VE ASSIGNED
SOME EXTRA CREDIT.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.467
SO IF HE COMPLETES IT,

17:14.501 --> 17:16.069
HE CAN KEEP HIS AVERAGE UP.

17:16.103 --> 17:19.606
SUCH A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU, OREL.

17:19.639 --> 17:20.740
HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY.

17:26.313 --> 17:28.281
[Tara laughing]
OH, MY GOD.

17:28.315 --> 17:30.583
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.
OH, PIFFLE.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.885
IT WAS AMAZING.
"OH, NO
YOU DIDN'T, ALICE."

17:32.919 --> 17:35.155
IT WAS A TOUR DE FORCE.

17:35.188 --> 17:37.224
OH, THE FRENCH LANGUAGE
IS SO EXPRESSIVE.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.658
DON'T YOU THINK, KATE?

17:40.127 --> 17:41.828
CAN I HAVE WINE
WITH MY MEAL?

17:41.861 --> 17:42.895
NO.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.597
WHEN SOMEONE
ASKS YOU A QUESTION,

17:44.631 --> 17:46.032
IT'S CUSTOMARY
TO LIFT YOUR GAZE

17:46.065 --> 17:48.368
TO MEET THEIRS
AND RESPOND IN KIND.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.303
WHEN'S MOM COMING BACK?

17:50.337 --> 17:52.639
OH, TARA'S NOT EQUIPPED
TO MANAGE THIS FAMILY

17:52.672 --> 17:53.773
AT THE MOMENT.

17:53.806 --> 17:55.408
NOW, WE'VE ALL COME
TO A CONSENSUS,

17:55.442 --> 17:57.144
AND I THINK YOU
NEED ME RIGHT NOW.
[scoffs]

17:57.177 --> 17:58.778
THAT'S ENOUGH
WITH YOUR GADGET.
[phone ringing]

17:58.811 --> 18:00.380
YOU CAN COMMUNICATE
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND LATER.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.781
UH, JUST ONE GLASS?
NO.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.650
OH, FOR GOODNESS...
[laughing]

18:03.683 --> 18:05.652
ALICE, I DON'T HAVE
A BOYFRIEND ANYMORE,

18:05.685 --> 18:07.620
BECAUSE MY MOM
TURNED INTO A MAN,

18:07.654 --> 18:08.788
CAME TO SCHOOL,

18:08.821 --> 18:10.323
AND GIMP-SLAPPED HIM,
[Max sighs]

18:10.357 --> 18:13.092
WHILE EVERYONE
I'VE EVER MET WATCHED.

18:13.126 --> 18:14.694
WELL, HE HAD BAD GENES.

18:14.727 --> 18:17.330
YOUR CHILDREN
WOULD'VE BEEN UGLY AND STUPID.

18:19.132 --> 18:20.833
(Max)
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

18:20.867 --> 18:24.271
JUST NEED SOME AIR.

18:25.138 --> 18:28.708
MM. THE FEAST IS HERE.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.243
CHICKEN, PLEASE.

18:30.277 --> 18:31.411
(waitress)
HERE YOU ARE.
THANK YOU.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.846
BE BACK IN A MOMENT,

WHAT IS IT?

18:44.791 --> 18:46.893
JUST HAVING A WEIRD DAY.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.561
WELL, SNAP YOURSELF
OUT OF IT.

18:48.595 --> 18:49.829
WE'RE HERE
TO HAVE A NICE DINNER.

18:49.862 --> 18:52.165
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
A NICE DINNER.

18:52.199 --> 18:54.267
KATE, I KNOW YOU
AREN'T FOND OF ME.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.802
BUT I'M CONCERNED
ABOUT YOUR DEVELOPMENT

18:55.835 --> 18:56.903
AS A YOUNG WOMAN.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.037
YOU'RE PROMISCUOUS.

18:58.070 --> 18:59.206
YOU AREN'T GUARDING
YOUR FLOWER.

18:59.239 --> 19:03.142
WHAT DO YOU WANT, ALICE?

19:03.176 --> 19:04.477
I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW

19:04.511 --> 19:06.313
THAT EVEN THOUGH
I DEEPLY DISAPPROVE

19:06.346 --> 19:07.980
OF THE WAY
YOU CARRY YOURSELF,

19:08.014 --> 19:12.519
YOUR MOTHER
LOVES YOU VERY MUCH.

19:12.552 --> 19:13.620
YEAH?

19:13.653 --> 19:15.021
YES.

19:15.054 --> 19:18.325
SHE WANTS YOU TO KNOW
SHE DIDN'T MEAN TO OVERREACT

19:18.358 --> 19:21.294
ABOUT THOSE PILLS
YOU BROUGHT HOME.

19:21.328 --> 19:24.464
SHE JUST DOESN'T WANT YOU
BEING...

19:24.497 --> 19:26.499
INTIMATE AT YOUR AGE.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.401
BECAUSE SHE HAD YOU
AT 19,

19:28.435 --> 19:31.338
AND THAT WAS
QUITE A HARDSHIP.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.905
I'M NOT A HARDSHIP.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.507
I'M AWESOME.

19:34.541 --> 19:37.544
YOU'RE A GRACELESS INGRATE.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.616
YOU MEAN A SLUT?

19:45.352 --> 19:47.354
A GIRL WHO LIKES BOYS?

19:47.387 --> 19:50.056
WHO LETS BOYS KNOW
SHE LIKES THEM?

19:50.089 --> 19:52.659
A GIRL WHO ORGASMS,

19:52.692 --> 19:57.330
WHO MOANS AND MOANS
AND SCREAMS IN ECSTASY?

19:57.364 --> 20:00.733
A GIRL WHO SUCKS AND FUCKS?

20:02.869 --> 20:07.974
A GIRL WITH ABSOLUTELY
NO BACK-DOOR SHYNESS.

20:10.243 --> 20:11.778
THAT'S IT.

20:11.811 --> 20:14.113
I'M GOING TO WASH YOUR MOUTH OUT
WITH SOAP.

20:14.146 --> 20:15.482
[laughing]

20:15.515 --> 20:16.783
YOU HAVE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

20:16.816 --> 20:17.850
TRY ME.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.286
[muffled screams]

20:19.319 --> 20:22.255
WHAT I WAS SAYING ABOUT--
[muffled screams]

20:24.624 --> 20:25.925
HEY!

20:25.958 --> 20:28.295

[crying]

20:48.114 --> 20:49.716
KATE?

20:49.749 --> 20:52.919
THIS IS
FUCKING BULLSHIT.

20:55.187 --> 20:57.023
OH, GOD,

20:57.056 --> 21:00.293
HOW?

21:11.838 --> 21:13.406
ARE YOU HIRING?

21:13.440 --> 21:14.874
ALWAYS.

21:14.907 --> 21:17.377
I'D LIKE TO FILL OUT
AN APPLICATION.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.213
WHY DO YOU WANT
TO WORK HERE?

21:21.247 --> 21:23.450

IF YOU NEED
A LITTLE WALKING STICK.

21:42.101 --> 21:43.636
COOL, THANKS.

21:43.670 --> 21:45.938
WOULD YOU LIKE ME

21:48.941 --> 21:52.679

I THINK I CAN HANDLE IT.

21:55.948 --> 21:57.984
I KNOW YOU TEE-TEED
IN YOUR BED.

21:59.752 --> 22:02.622
YOU KNOW, LACK OF CONTROL
IS NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.491
LOTS OF DEBONAIR MEN
THROUGHOUT HISTORY

22:04.524 --> 22:06.258
HAVE HAD THEIR PECCADILLOES.

22:06.292 --> 22:10.397

TO WEAR WOMEN'S UNDERWEAR.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.669
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.538
I MEAN, I HAVEN'T HAD
AN ACCIDENT IN YEARS.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.139
IT'S WEIRD.
OH!

22:20.172 --> 22:22.274
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT,
SWEETIE.

22:22.308 --> 22:25.545
NO.

22:25.578 --> 22:26.813
YOU KNOW, SOMEDAY,

22:26.846 --> 22:29.449
IF EVERYTHING GOES
THE WAY I'M HOPING,

22:29.482 --> 22:32.284
I'LL BE HERE ALL THE TIME.

22:32.318 --> 22:34.854

ABOUT ALICE

23:02.882 --> 23:07.119
IT'S KIND OF FUNNY,

23:07.153 --> 23:10.757
IT'S ABOUT AS FUNNY
AS AN IRREGULAR MOLE.

23:10.790 --> 23:11.758
YEAH.

23:11.791 --> 23:13.726
YEAH.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.828
MARSH TOLD ME
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

23:15.862 --> 23:19.398
AND IT'S UNFAIR.
I'M SORRY, HONEY.

23:32.912 --> 23:35.347
REMEMBER ALL THOSE PHOTOS
YOU USED TO KEEP IN A SHOE BOX?

23:35.381 --> 23:37.383
ALICE ORGANIZED THEM ALL
EARLIER TODAY

23:37.416 --> 23:40.953
AND MADE EVERYBODY
A PHOTO ALBUM.

23:40.987 --> 23:42.388

24:15.822 --> 24:18.257
NO, I THINK
I'LL JUST KIND OF...

IT'S HARDLY MY PLACE TO SAY.

24:57.329 --> 25:00.733
AND MARSHALL'S WORKING ON HIS
WINTER OF DISCONTENT PROJECT.

25:00.767 --> 25:02.702

MY FAVORITE BOOKS AT RADCLIFFE.

25:02.735 --> 25:05.004
YOU DIDN'T GO TO RADCLIFFE.

IN MY JEANS.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.385
OKAY?

25:19.418 --> 25:20.787
WHY DID YOU FEEL THE NEED

25:20.820 --> 25:23.956
TO SANITIZE
MY KID'S MOUTH, ANYWAY?

25:23.990 --> 25:26.726
SHE WAS USING
SOME VERY UNBECOMING LANGUAGE.

25:26.759 --> 25:28.260
WELL, SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN
OUTSPOKEN--

25:28.294 --> 25:30.162

SO MAYBE FROM NOW ON,

25:31.631 --> 25:34.934
LET ME DOLE OUT
THE PUNISHMENT, OKAY?
