WEBVTT

00:06.340 --> 00:07.175
Forty-five.

00:07.208 --> 00:08.209
Don't let him win, Burt.

00:08.242 --> 00:09.410
(doorbell rings)

00:09.443 --> 00:10.778
I'd rather melt
cheese on cardboard

00:10.811 --> 00:12.746
than eat a pizza with
a whole wheat crust.

00:14.815 --> 00:16.250
Hello, Chances.

00:16.284 --> 00:17.618
I know it took me
several weeks,

00:17.651 --> 00:20.188
but I finally got through
Sabrina's grandmother's will.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.291
Who's the kid?
Oh, this is Kevin.

00:23.324 --> 00:27.128
I lost a key piece of evidence
in his father's murder trial,

00:27.161 --> 00:30.831
so he'll be staying with me for
the next five to seven years.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.266
So what did you find
in the will?

00:32.300 --> 00:33.234
Did I get anything else?

00:33.267 --> 00:36.137
Well, there were giant sections
of legalese

00:36.170 --> 00:38.272
that I honestly
couldn't get through.

00:38.306 --> 00:40.841
But according to Kevin,
I've got to give Jimmy

00:40.874 --> 00:42.310
a simple dental exam.

00:42.343 --> 00:43.111
Why?

00:43.144 --> 00:44.278
She wanted to make sure

00:44.312 --> 00:46.414
her descendants
had good chompers.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.249
Kevin, my tools.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.223
I need to count
your teeth.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.168
Settling an argument again, huh?

01:07.201 --> 01:11.339
You know, some families make
decisions by flipping coins.

01:11.372 --> 01:12.340
And some people wash their hands

01:12.373 --> 01:14.675
after they fill up
their car at the gas station.

01:14.708 --> 01:15.809
(sniffs)

01:15.843 --> 01:17.645
So we both have
things to work on.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.213
I'm sorry, wait,
what's the deal?

01:19.247 --> 01:20.614
Did we get the house or...?

01:20.648 --> 01:22.150
Yep. She's all yours.

01:23.384 --> 01:24.185
Oh.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.887
My associate
has just reminded me,

01:26.920 --> 01:28.789
you only get
your grandmother's house

01:28.822 --> 01:31.192
if you get married
in the family church.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.260
Nice work, Kevin.

01:32.293 --> 01:35.263
What? Now she's dictating
where we get married?

01:35.296 --> 01:36.630
I'm sorry, is there
anything in there about

01:36.664 --> 01:38.166
how we have to consummate
our marriage or...?

01:40.834 --> 01:42.336
Kevin says there isn't.

01:42.370 --> 01:44.305
And what does
"consummate" mean?

01:45.673 --> 01:47.508
I got this.

01:47.541 --> 01:51.379
Jimmy, go to the kitchen,
get me a banana and a donut.

01:51.412 --> 01:53.347
Take a seat, Kevin.

01:53.381 --> 01:55.249
Kick your feet up.

01:55.283 --> 01:56.584
This is gonna blow your mind.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.653
Whoo!

01:59.687 --> 02:01.289
* Here we go

02:01.322 --> 02:04.392
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

02:06.527 --> 02:07.928
Loved the sermon.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.730
That Jesus was
one hell of a guy.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.365
I wish I was the son of God.

02:11.399 --> 02:13.301
Do you know how many pools
I could clean

02:13.334 --> 02:14.235
if I could walk on water?

02:14.268 --> 02:15.836
You don't think you'd
just be constantly

02:15.869 --> 02:18.939
turning those pools into
giant cement boxes of wine?

02:18.972 --> 02:20.941
Yeah, that could be a problem.

02:20.974 --> 02:21.875
Guys, there's Reverend Bob.

02:21.909 --> 02:24.245
Okay, when he's done
talking to those people,

02:24.278 --> 02:25.246
let's just go
over there, huh?

02:25.279 --> 02:26.780
Sabrina! Sabrina!

02:26.814 --> 02:28.316
Oh, good, it is you!

02:28.349 --> 02:29.950
You know, I saw a mousy girl
with limp hair

02:29.983 --> 02:31.285
and I just took a gamble.

02:31.319 --> 02:32.753
There's somebody
that I want you to meet.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.555
I think he's my soul mate.

02:34.588 --> 02:35.723
He is signing
autographs.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.291
He's a minor league
baseball player.

02:37.325 --> 02:39.327
You're dating
"Rocket" Ricardo Montes?

02:39.360 --> 02:40.160
He's the greatest thing

02:40.194 --> 02:41.562
to happen to
the Natesville Radishes

02:41.595 --> 02:43.364
since they put that kangaroo
in left field.

02:43.397 --> 02:44.865
Well, I'll introduce you.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.367
But don't mention the kangaroo.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.468
He dropped a fly ball

02:47.501 --> 02:49.337
and cost Ricardo a no-hitter.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.305
No, thanks. I get too nervous
around celebrities.

02:52.373 --> 02:53.507
I met Scotch Wilkinson,

02:53.541 --> 02:55.443
the Channel Five weatherman,
at a gas station one time.

02:55.476 --> 02:58.312
I got so tongue-tied,
all I could yell was, "Weather!"

02:58.346 --> 03:00.448
Ricardo, I would like you
to meet, but not judge me by,

03:00.481 --> 03:01.749
my daughter Sabrina,

03:01.782 --> 03:04.918
her fiancé Jimmy,
his child with a serial killer

03:04.952 --> 03:06.320
and his poor parents.

03:06.354 --> 03:07.555
Uh... uh...

03:07.588 --> 03:08.756
(grunting)

03:09.790 --> 03:12.360
Baseball!

03:12.393 --> 03:13.494
(chuckles)

03:13.527 --> 03:15.329
Reverend Bob!

03:15.363 --> 03:19.367
Sabrina, I haven't
seen you here in years!

03:19.400 --> 03:20.834
Well, this is my
fiancé, Jimmy.

03:20.868 --> 03:21.669
Loved the sermon.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.337
I was totally surprised

03:23.371 --> 03:25.005
when it turned out to be Jesus
carrying him on the beach.

03:25.038 --> 03:28.276
Well, that Jesus was not
all great abs and nice hair.

03:28.309 --> 03:29.477
(chuckles)

03:29.510 --> 03:31.479
Congratulations on
your engagement.

03:31.512 --> 03:34.948
Actually, we were hoping
that you would maybe marry us.

03:35.716 --> 03:36.650
Oh, I'd be honored.

03:36.684 --> 03:37.985
And here's the great news:

03:38.018 --> 03:39.487
our church is offering

03:39.520 --> 03:41.989
a free weekend retreat

03:42.022 --> 03:43.957
for our engaged couples.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.526
We eat gourmet food,

03:45.559 --> 03:47.461
we stay in deluxe
accommodations,

03:47.495 --> 03:51.365
we sign a waiver
promising not to fornicate.

03:51.399 --> 03:52.800
Wow.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.368
Sign me up for most of that!

03:54.402 --> 03:57.538
Another fun thing we can't do
just 'cause we're married.

03:57.571 --> 04:02.042
You can't be Miss America,
I can't go on The Bachelor.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.511
I'm sick of this.

04:03.544 --> 04:04.978
Right on, Burt.

04:05.012 --> 04:08.248
I say it's time we fight back
against this discrimination.

04:12.052 --> 04:14.388
Excuse me, Reverend Bob.

04:14.422 --> 04:15.989
I'm Virginia Chance.

04:16.023 --> 04:19.327
This is my fiancé.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.529
Oh, man,
everyone gets to go

04:21.562 --> 04:23.897
to a cool couple's camp
except us.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.970
Tamara Anderson-Collins-
Rabinowitz-Yang,

04:30.003 --> 04:31.038
will you do me

04:31.071 --> 04:32.005
the honor of becoming my wife

04:32.039 --> 04:34.375
and making me
the happiest relief pitcher

04:34.408 --> 04:36.544
in the Single-A Developmental
Prospect League?

04:36.577 --> 04:38.679
Yes, but can you wait
three weeks

04:38.712 --> 04:40.848
till my divorce is official?

04:40.881 --> 04:44.952
For you, I could
wait a month.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.693
So, big weekend
in the country, huh?

04:52.726 --> 04:54.094
Hey, I'm sorry
for the short notice.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.529
I really appreciate this.

04:55.563 --> 04:56.730
Hope's over
at Shelley's,

04:56.764 --> 04:57.898
but Maw Maw and Shelley

04:57.931 --> 04:59.467
aren't on the best of terms
right now.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.402
You know, they'll be okay
after the election.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.437
MAW MAW: I don't need anyone
to babysit me!

05:03.471 --> 05:06.407
I can feed myself, dress myself,
and wipe my own...

05:06.440 --> 05:08.442
How did that get there?

05:08.476 --> 05:10.444
Thanks, Barney.

05:10.478 --> 05:11.144
You're a lifesaver.

05:11.178 --> 05:13.013
No problem.
Have a great time!

05:13.046 --> 05:15.082
(chuckles)

05:17.618 --> 05:19.420
Huh.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.892
Huh.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.463
Uh, hi, Mom.

05:29.497 --> 05:31.899
Can you put Mom on, too?

05:31.932 --> 05:32.833
Hi, Mom.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.068
Uh, I'm afraid
I'm going to have to miss

05:35.102 --> 05:37.471
my birthday brunch tomorrow.

05:37.505 --> 05:38.472
Yeah.

05:38.506 --> 05:39.973
Apparently, I was dead wrong.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.443
Babysitting an old woman
was not a ruse

05:42.476 --> 05:45.446
to get me over here
for my surprise party.

05:45.479 --> 05:46.947
Don't get too comfortable.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.082
If they're paying you,
you're gonna earn it.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.451
Put these on.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.520
I'll meet you
in the bathroom.

05:58.559 --> 06:01.495
("Tequila" by The Champs
playing)

06:29.590 --> 06:30.924
BOTH:
Tequila!

06:30.958 --> 06:33.160
(turns off truck, music stops)

06:36.196 --> 06:38.165
Welcome, couples!

06:38.198 --> 06:39.633
This is
my lovely wife, Lisa,

06:39.667 --> 06:42.002
whom I met in the Philippines.

06:42.035 --> 06:42.836
In case you're wondering,

06:42.870 --> 06:45.539
she's free to leave
anytime she wants.

06:46.974 --> 06:50.077
Uh, Lisa, would you give
our guests their welcome gifts.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.182
Bags to people!

06:55.215 --> 06:57.551
Ooh, it's heavy.

06:57.585 --> 06:59.152
This might be the
Ten Commandments.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.821
We got a ham?

07:00.854 --> 07:03.791
We, too, got a ham.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.125
The mystery thickens.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.227
Yep, it's a ham,
all right.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.896
And T-shirts.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.632
That smell like ham.

07:11.665 --> 07:15.168
These hams represent
your marriages.

07:15.202 --> 07:18.539
If you can get through
the weekend with your hams

07:18.572 --> 07:20.608
unscathed, then you will have

07:20.641 --> 07:25.746
the foundations in place
for an everlasting partnership.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.015
Oh, honey,
with my marriage experience

07:28.048 --> 07:31.619
and your rock-hard pecs, our ham
is gonna crush their ham.

07:31.652 --> 07:32.653
(sighs)

07:32.686 --> 07:35.255
Mom, this is about
strengthening our relationships.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.024
This is not a competition.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.993
Couples, are you ready
for a little competition?!

07:40.027 --> 07:40.728
Whoo!

07:42.029 --> 07:43.597
(keyboard plays
synthesized music)

07:43.631 --> 07:44.598
(laughs)

07:44.632 --> 07:46.266
Okay, gentlemen,

07:46.299 --> 07:49.002
while you were in
the isolation bathroom,

07:49.036 --> 07:51.238
we asked the ladies
a couple of questions

07:51.271 --> 07:53.607
and they wrote down
what they thought

07:53.641 --> 07:55.242
your responses
would be.

07:55.275 --> 07:58.612
If your spouse could be
married to a celebrity,

07:58.646 --> 07:59.747
who would they choose?

07:59.780 --> 08:00.848
Ricardo?

08:00.881 --> 08:02.650
You are correct.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.918
"Ricardo Montes!"

08:04.952 --> 08:05.619
Burt?

08:05.653 --> 08:07.187
Al Pacino.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.088
"Al Pacino."

08:08.121 --> 08:09.757
It'd be an easy transition.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.892
Burt already says "Hoo-hah!"
a lot during sex.

08:11.925 --> 08:12.760
Hoo-hah!

08:12.793 --> 08:13.627
(chuckles)

08:13.661 --> 08:14.595
Jimmy?

08:14.628 --> 08:17.130
Woody Allen.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.699
"Ryan Gosling."

08:18.732 --> 08:19.967
If you don't think
he's so great,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.636
why you make me watch
all those boring movies?

08:22.670 --> 08:26.874
A meteor is heading
to your house.

08:26.907 --> 08:30.644
What would your partner say was
the one thing you would save?

08:30.678 --> 08:31.779
Burt?

08:31.812 --> 08:32.680
The world.

08:33.814 --> 08:34.314
Jimmy?

08:34.347 --> 08:35.315
I don't know.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.084
We use the toaster oven a lot.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.151
"Hope."

08:38.185 --> 08:39.920
Oh, yeah,
that's better.

08:39.953 --> 08:40.821
She's right on that one.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.756
Burt, how did Virginia say

08:42.790 --> 08:44.892
you would complete
this sentence? "I..."

08:44.925 --> 08:46.694
"Never met a monkey I didn't
want to shake hands with!"

08:49.029 --> 08:51.064
Oh, come on, they're
getting all the easy ones!

08:51.098 --> 08:52.099
Whoo!

08:52.132 --> 08:55.102
What did your partner say

08:55.135 --> 08:56.737
was her favorite food?

08:56.770 --> 08:57.671
Burt?

08:57.705 --> 08:59.640
Chicken Gordon Blue.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.675
"Chicken Gordon Blue."

09:01.709 --> 09:02.710
Ricardo?

09:02.743 --> 09:04.244
She likes belly button berries.

09:04.277 --> 09:07.615
"Anything off
Ricardo's stomach."

09:08.315 --> 09:10.117
We'll give it to them.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.685
Jimmy?

09:11.719 --> 09:13.721
She always says
when she's really hungry

09:13.754 --> 09:15.255
that she could eat a horse.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.256
So I'm going
with horse.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.124
It doesn't say "horse."

09:17.157 --> 09:19.760
All right.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.829
Now we're gonna send
the women off

09:21.862 --> 09:23.964
and we're gonna ask the men
a few questions.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.633
We'll take a quick break.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.212
(sighs heavily)

09:40.981 --> 09:42.816
Come on.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.051
If it's your birthday,

09:44.084 --> 09:46.119
we should hop a ride
on the old drunk train.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.655
First stop,

09:47.688 --> 09:49.189
Sloppytown.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.325
All aboard!

09:53.326 --> 09:54.695
If you think you
can handle it.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.830
I'm 40 years old,
I live by myself,

09:56.864 --> 09:58.165
and I manage a grocery store.

09:58.198 --> 10:00.333
You don't think I drink?

10:01.234 --> 10:03.270
(coughing)

10:05.773 --> 10:06.874
You don't drink, do you?

10:06.907 --> 10:08.976
A little wine
on special occasions.

10:09.009 --> 10:11.044
(keyboard plays
synthesized music)

10:15.783 --> 10:18.051
And we're back.

10:18.085 --> 10:19.753
Thank you, Lisa.

10:19.787 --> 10:22.155
I clearly asked you to get us
a pitcher of water,

10:22.189 --> 10:24.157
but the dance was nice.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.894
Okay, ladies, what
did the men say is

10:26.927 --> 10:28.829
your most embarrassing secret?

10:28.862 --> 10:29.897
Tamara?

10:29.930 --> 10:31.732
I'm not really 32.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.001
"She's 33."

10:34.034 --> 10:34.567
(giggles)

10:34.601 --> 10:37.004
Plus tax and deposit.

10:37.037 --> 10:37.938
Virginia?

10:37.971 --> 10:39.006
Lost our sex tape.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.208
BOB:
"Lost our best sex tape."

10:43.243 --> 10:44.177
Sabrina?

10:44.211 --> 10:46.747
I'm afraid of spiders
crawling in my ears,

10:46.780 --> 10:48.749
so sometimes I sleep with
a panty-ho on my head.

10:48.782 --> 10:53.386
BOB: "Sits backwards
on the toilet when she poops."

10:53.420 --> 10:55.288
I enjoy reading,

10:55.322 --> 10:56.356
and sometimes

10:56.389 --> 10:58.191
it's easy to put
the book on the...

10:58.225 --> 10:59.426
the back of the toi...

10:59.459 --> 11:00.728
Okay, you know what, great.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.062
Now both these things
are out there

11:02.095 --> 11:03.831
and we haven't even got
one question right.

11:03.864 --> 11:07.400
Ladies, what does
your man consider

11:07.434 --> 11:09.402
to be your cutest habit?

11:09.436 --> 11:12.239
Virginia?

11:12.272 --> 11:15.776
"Scrunches up her face
when she thinks!"

11:17.778 --> 11:20.113
Ladies, what did the gentlemen
say was the biggest challenge

11:20.147 --> 11:21.782
you've overcome
in your relationship?

11:21.815 --> 11:22.783
Sabrina?

11:22.816 --> 11:24.451
I don't know. I give up.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.387
We'll give it to you.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.255
(keyboard plays
synthesized music)

11:28.288 --> 11:30.323
Virginia?
Got stranded in Cleveland.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.158
BOB:
"Got stranded in Cleveland."

11:31.191 --> 11:32.993
(grunts)

11:33.026 --> 11:33.961
Tamara?

11:33.994 --> 11:35.128
He hates my church.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.165
"Hates her church."

11:38.198 --> 11:40.400
No offense, but your choir
has no flair.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.970
I'm doing the best I can
with what I have!

11:43.003 --> 11:45.873
Let's look at
the final scores.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.975
Let's show them
what they've won!

11:48.008 --> 11:49.777
(keyboard plays
synthesized music)

11:49.810 --> 11:53.246
Unfortunately, we only have
two deluxe cabins.

11:53.280 --> 11:56.249
We had three, but the
meth-heads got into one

11:56.283 --> 11:57.184
and blew it up.

11:57.217 --> 12:00.487
This is where the
losers have to sleep.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.322
Oh, man up!
Tomorrow's another day.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.291
And I'm hoping
y'all do better.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.259
In fact, you have to,

12:06.293 --> 12:08.996
if you want to get married
in our church.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.500
If he doesn't marry us,
we're gonna lose Nana's house

12:13.533 --> 12:16.003
and wind up living
in a dump like this.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.304
Who cares about the house?

12:17.337 --> 12:20.107
I mean, we only got
one question right.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.442
If we're gonna get married,

12:22.475 --> 12:24.978
I just, I want us
to be so connected

12:25.012 --> 12:26.880
that we finish
each other's...

12:26.914 --> 12:28.281
Vegetables?

12:28.315 --> 12:30.217
Laundry? Popcorn?

12:30.250 --> 12:31.952
Take the ham.

12:31.985 --> 12:34.187
I'm going to bed.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.023
Now you're just throwing
our relationship around

12:36.056 --> 12:37.858
like a piece of meat?!

12:37.891 --> 12:40.293
I just hate to see them
arguing like this.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.561
(shouting)

12:41.594 --> 12:42.896
They sound as bad as us

12:42.930 --> 12:44.197
when we got stranded
in Cleveland.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.033
You were mad at me.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.968
'Cause you promised
to stay awake on the bus

12:48.001 --> 12:49.502
so we wouldn't miss
our stop in Indianapolis.

12:49.536 --> 12:52.172
Wakey Burt makes promises
sleepy Burt can't keep.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.373
Besides, once
we got hoarse

12:53.406 --> 12:55.976
from screaming, and you stopped
hitting me with your shoe,

12:56.009 --> 12:58.245
we calmed down
and we figured it out together.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.914
It wa kind of romantic.

13:00.948 --> 13:03.516
All those pretty fountains
we stole the coins from

13:03.550 --> 13:05.385
till we had enough
to bribe the bus driver.

13:05.418 --> 13:07.220
He let us stow away
in the luggage compartment

13:07.254 --> 13:08.188
all the way back to Natesville.

13:08.221 --> 13:10.190
The night we joined
the Two-Foot-High Club.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.194
(Jimmy and Sabrina arguing)

13:14.227 --> 13:15.929
You thinking what I'm thinking?

13:15.963 --> 13:19.166
We just got 20 out of 20 correct
answers in a compatibility game.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.201
Of course I'm thinking
what you're thinking.

13:26.139 --> 13:29.042
Hey, Sabrina?

13:29.076 --> 13:31.044
Where'd the buildings go?

13:31.078 --> 13:32.579
Huh?

13:32.612 --> 13:34.114
I think maybe

13:34.147 --> 13:35.916
we moved, Jimmy.

13:35.949 --> 13:37.017
All right,
don't panic,

13:37.050 --> 13:39.452
but I think there's a
spider under your panty-ho.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.254
What?! Oh, God!

13:41.288 --> 13:42.555
Oh, God!

13:42.589 --> 13:44.824
(grunting)

13:48.561 --> 13:50.197
Is it dead?

13:50.230 --> 13:51.999
(panting)

13:52.032 --> 13:54.267
Oh, it was just
a piece of lint.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.973
(sighs)

14:00.007 --> 14:03.076
I really think we're supposed
to find our way back to camp.

14:03.110 --> 14:06.113
Only question
is: which way?

14:06.146 --> 14:09.082
I think that way.

14:09.116 --> 14:10.050
All right, fine.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.085
Let's hurry.

14:12.119 --> 14:13.921
I think our marriage
is leaking.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.324
(sighs)

14:20.027 --> 14:21.995
Are they back yet?
Did they walk in?

14:22.029 --> 14:23.263
No, and stop
panicking.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.065
Your armpit sweat's
running under my bra.

14:25.098 --> 14:28.168
Okay, everybody, bad news.

14:28.201 --> 14:31.104
Jimmy and Sabrina
stole the trailer.

14:31.671 --> 14:32.505
Wait!

14:33.540 --> 14:37.177
Uh... we have
a confession to make.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.613
You know,

14:40.647 --> 14:43.250
I used to think I didn't have
any friends because I was fat.

14:43.283 --> 14:46.086
Now I've lost the weight, and
the only difference in my life

14:46.119 --> 14:48.088
is eight cubic yards
of extra skin.

14:48.121 --> 14:50.490
Don't get me started
on extra skin.

14:50.523 --> 14:54.094
I'm three years away from being
able to tie my ass in a knot.

14:55.162 --> 14:57.597
The point is, it's my birthday,

14:57.630 --> 14:58.999
and I've never felt lower.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.133
Oh.

15:00.167 --> 15:01.368
Now would be the perfect time

15:01.401 --> 15:04.471
for everyone to jump out
and yell "surprise!"

15:04.504 --> 15:07.074
You gonna keep doing
that every 15 minutes

15:07.107 --> 15:08.508
or are we gonna drink?

15:10.210 --> 15:13.113
So we towed the trailer about
half a mile into the woods

15:13.146 --> 15:16.149
so they would have to face a
challenge together like we did.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.085
I don't mean
to frighten anyone,

15:18.118 --> 15:20.653
but based on the time my team
bus broke down in Death Valley,

15:20.687 --> 15:22.189
pretty soon,
they will be

15:22.222 --> 15:24.024
at the point where
they will have to make a choice

15:24.057 --> 15:27.660
between starving to death or...

15:27.694 --> 15:29.696
eating the batboy.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.065
They are not
going to starve to death.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.566
They have an entire ham!

15:33.600 --> 15:35.702
Well, I hope
they ditched the ham.

15:35.735 --> 15:38.105
Those woods are full of bears.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.007
(growling)

15:42.209 --> 15:43.410
Jimmy, throw the ham!

15:43.443 --> 15:46.146
Throw the ham as far away as you
can and get him away from us!

15:46.179 --> 15:47.414
(gasps)

15:47.447 --> 15:49.516
(growls)

15:49.549 --> 15:51.184
I'm sorry!
It's a slippery ham!

15:51.218 --> 15:52.052
Hams are slippery!

15:52.085 --> 15:53.553
Well, that's not
gonna last very long.

15:53.586 --> 15:56.223
North American bears can eat
40 pounds of meat a day.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.324
And since he's gearing up
for hibernation,

15:57.357 --> 15:58.558
he can eat twice that.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.160
You know about bears?

16:00.193 --> 16:02.362
Yeah, my dad and I watch
Bear Week every year.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.764
Me, too. I did a report
on them in middle school.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.100
See? We do have
stuff in common.

16:07.134 --> 16:09.069
So, you realize that
that means that bear

16:09.102 --> 16:10.537
could climb up this
tree very easily.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.205
Oh, yeah, second he's done
eating our marriage,

16:12.239 --> 16:13.573
he's coming after us.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.342
For the record, bears are no
longer my favorite animal.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.244
(growling)

16:17.277 --> 16:19.046
Well,

16:19.079 --> 16:20.247
I tried to call

16:20.280 --> 16:24.551
the forest rangers, but our
telephone has been disconnected.

16:24.584 --> 16:25.685
It seems that

16:25.718 --> 16:28.088
a certain Miss Chatty-Chat
cannot seem

16:28.121 --> 16:31.258
to get off the phone
to her mother in Manila.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.693
(Filipino accent):
"It's raining, it's raining,

16:33.726 --> 16:35.262
it's raining."

16:35.295 --> 16:36.429
(normal voice):
We get it!

16:36.463 --> 16:38.231
Do you have a gun?

16:38.265 --> 16:40.367
I got a tranquilizer gun.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.269
Then I shall use
your sleep-inducing gun

16:42.302 --> 16:43.236
and I will save their life.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.072
Or at the very least,

16:45.105 --> 16:48.175
return with the horribly mangled
remains of your daughter,

16:48.208 --> 16:50.143
so you can have some closure,
my love.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.078
Wow.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.280
You know, not many men
can make the thought

16:53.313 --> 16:55.415
of losing a
child so sexy.

16:55.448 --> 16:56.616
Now, before we
get too crazy,

16:56.649 --> 16:58.218
let's not rule out
the possibility

16:58.251 --> 17:00.520
of them walking through
that door at any second.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.062
Okay, get the gun!

17:12.632 --> 17:14.734
You're a good
man, Barney.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.336
Thanks.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.604
(sighs)

17:17.637 --> 17:19.839
I'm glad I didn't
spend my birthday alone.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.274
You're a fine lady,

17:21.308 --> 17:23.110
Barbara June.

17:23.143 --> 17:26.279
I hope you get your wish
and die peacefully.

17:26.313 --> 17:27.814
Oh, thank you.

17:27.847 --> 17:32.319
You're not one of the sexy
ones, or the rich ones,

17:32.352 --> 17:36.156
but y-you're one of
the good ones, Barney.

17:39.226 --> 17:42.329
That's the most beautiful thing
anyone's ever said to me.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.631
What did I say?

17:44.664 --> 17:46.233
(growling)

17:46.266 --> 17:48.335
You sure this is a good idea?

17:50.237 --> 17:52.305
No, but it's
the best idea.

17:52.339 --> 17:55.208
I mean, we jump out of the
tree, we make a lot of noise,

17:55.242 --> 17:57.210
maybe we can scare
the bear away.

17:57.244 --> 17:59.446
Maybe I should try and scare him
and you should run.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.348
What? No, Jimmy.

18:01.381 --> 18:02.115
I'm not leaving you.

18:02.149 --> 18:04.451
Till death do
us part, right?

18:04.484 --> 18:07.220
Hopefully not today, but yes.

18:07.254 --> 18:09.422
(bear growling)

18:10.323 --> 18:11.658
RICARDO:
I see them!

18:11.691 --> 18:13.326
Oh, my God, they're being
attacked by a bear!

18:13.360 --> 18:14.194
Hold on, wait!

18:14.227 --> 18:16.196
I want to record you
saving my daughter.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.631
She's always complaining that
I don't take enough home videos.

18:18.665 --> 18:20.500
How long does it take one
of those tranquilizer darts

18:20.533 --> 18:21.734
to knock a bear out?

18:21.768 --> 18:23.370
I think about two minutes,
'cause on Bear Week,

18:23.403 --> 18:25.372
they shoot the bear,
then they go to a commercial

18:25.405 --> 18:27.907
for gold coins, cars and about
four other shows about bears.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.709
And then they come back,
that thing's out cold.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.211
Okay, go.

18:34.614 --> 18:35.748
(both yell)

18:35.782 --> 18:37.417
(gunshot)

18:45.858 --> 18:47.194
(growling)

18:55.735 --> 18:57.270
What happened?

18:57.304 --> 18:58.405
Is Sabrina okay?

18:58.438 --> 18:59.939
You're both fine.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.341
It was awesome!

19:02.275 --> 19:03.676
I filmed it
with my phone.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.413
VIRGINIA: Ricardo's first shot
missed the bear and hit you.

19:06.446 --> 19:08.215
(Sabrina screaming)

19:08.248 --> 19:09.882
But then Sabrina
came to your defense.

19:09.916 --> 19:13.286
(bear growling)

19:13.320 --> 19:14.153
With his second shot,

19:14.187 --> 19:16.723
he missed the bear again
and hit Sabrina.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.758
(gunshot)

19:21.761 --> 19:23.563
RICARDO: After the last
shot, I got smart.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.332
(gunshot)
So I aimed for Sabrina

19:25.365 --> 19:27.934
and hit the bear.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.969
(gasps)

19:30.002 --> 19:32.405
What happened?

19:32.439 --> 19:34.274
Easy. Go slow.

19:34.307 --> 19:37.244
Your 80-pound body took a dart
meant for a 400-pound bear.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.278
(gasps)

19:40.280 --> 19:42.382
I am so glad
that you're both okay.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.284
And I'm sorry
that I ever doubted

19:44.317 --> 19:46.319
whether you were
compatible.

19:46.353 --> 19:49.389
I mean, you fought
a bear together,

19:49.422 --> 19:51.258
for crying out loud.

19:51.291 --> 19:54.527
I cannot think of
a better test of your love.

19:55.428 --> 19:57.364
Oh, Jimmy, I love you!

19:57.397 --> 19:59.566
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.534
Yuck.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.272
JIMMY:
Some couples know right away

20:05.305 --> 20:06.939
that they're made
for each other.

20:06.973 --> 20:10.277
So, uh, who is Antonio?

20:10.310 --> 20:11.444
That's a long story.

20:11.478 --> 20:12.845
Why? Does it
make you jealous?

20:19.719 --> 20:21.921
And some couples get better
the longer they're together.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.456
What'd you snag?

20:23.490 --> 20:25.024
Shampoo. How about you?

20:25.057 --> 20:26.459
Conditioner!

20:26.493 --> 20:27.994
BOTH:
Aw!

20:28.027 --> 20:30.029
Sabrina and me--
it took a moment of crisis

20:30.062 --> 20:32.299
to see that we were
meant to be together.

20:32.332 --> 20:33.500
Let's go home and finish...

20:33.533 --> 20:34.967
Each other's sentences?

20:35.001 --> 20:37.370
I was gonna say, "getting the
bear slobber out of your hair,"

20:37.404 --> 20:38.671
but I appreciate the effort.

20:39.939 --> 20:43.343
And some other couples
were just getting started.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.045
Hi, sugar.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.947
Oh, my God.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.416
Did we...?

20:49.449 --> 20:50.517
Oh, yeah.

20:50.550 --> 20:53.553
Does that supermarket of
yours sell pregnancy tests?

20:56.456 --> 20:58.358
Hi, Barney.

20:58.391 --> 20:59.792
(gasps)

20:59.826 --> 21:00.793
Virginia, you're home.

21:00.827 --> 21:01.828
How was Maw Maw?

21:01.861 --> 21:03.496
How do you mean that?

21:03.530 --> 21:05.064
Alive or dead?

21:05.097 --> 21:06.666
Alive.

21:06.699 --> 21:07.800
Very alive.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.336
I have to go home now

21:09.369 --> 21:11.304
and take some showers.

21:15.508 --> 21:17.710
Maw Maw?

21:17.744 --> 21:18.878
What did you do to him?

21:18.911 --> 21:20.980
He passed out in the kitchen,

21:21.013 --> 21:24.016
so I pulled him into my bedroom
and let him think he got lucky.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.918
It was my little
birthday gift to him.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.920
You didn't let him know
about the big surprise party

21:27.954 --> 21:29.021
we're throwing him
tonight, did you?

21:29.055 --> 21:31.057
He has no idea.

21:37.397 --> 21:39.466
