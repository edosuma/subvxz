00:14.920 --> 00:17.450

<b><i>If you can't defeat Shoot tomorrow,</i></b>

<b>As they prepare to challenge Knuckle and Shoot,</b>

02:24.400 --> 02:27.550
<b>Gon and Killua are deep in thought.</b>

02:40.170 --> 02:42.050
<b><i>The loser...</i></b>

<b><i>If it's a speed contest, he can toy with me.</i></b>

03:16.880 --> 03:18.520
<b><i>I have to be ready to take the hit...</i></b>

03:20.560 --> 03:22.340
<b><i>And counterattack!</i></b>

03:30.520 --> 03:31.770
<b><i>Don't follow him by sight.</i></b>

03:33.120 --> 03:34.250

<b><i>Through my aura!</i></b>

03:58.450 --> 04:01.330
<b><i>A little late, but I sensed his approach!</i></b>

04:03.420 --> 04:06.430
<b><i>But what's going on?</i></b>

04:13.640 --> 04:16.620
<b>I feel power rushing through my body...</b>

04:25.610 --> 04:26.820
<b>It's time.</b>

04:27.950 --> 04:29.790
<b>Adding interest.</b>

04:33.510 --> 04:35.830
<b>Wh-What is this thing?</b>

04:37.780 --> 04:40.000
<b>I let you borrow</b>

04:40.880 --> 04:42.570
<b>some of my aura.</b>

04:42.980 --> 04:45.630
<b>You let me borrow your aura?</b>

04:46.070 --> 04:48.410
<b>By the way, I charge ten percent interest.</b>

04:48.880 --> 04:50.560
<b>Ten percent</b>

04:51.330 --> 04:52.640
<b>every ten seconds!</b>

04:54.480 --> 04:57.050
<b>If you don't repay the debt, you'll bust.</b>

04:57.800 --> 04:58.900
<b>It's time.</b>

04:59.390 --> 05:00.780
<b>Adding interest.</b>

05:04.810 --> 05:07.910
<b>I call this ability "Chapter 7 Bankruptcy."</b>

05:07.950 --> 05:10.030
<b>I Alone Lose When It Reaches the Heavens</b>

05:10.030 --> 05:11.660
<b>I Alone Lose When It Reaches the Heavens 
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy</b>

05:10.280 --> 05:13.490
<b>That's the mascot, Amortizing Power Redirector.</b>

05:16.740 --> 05:20.020
<b>Attacking APR is a waste of time...</b>

05:21.180 --> 05:24.850
<b>It'll just hang around you, 
telling you when your interest goes up.</b>

05:24.850 --> 05:26.880
<b>It's both harmless and invincible.</b>

05:28.710 --> 05:30.680
<b>Though it can be an eyesore...</b>

05:31.110 --> 05:32.400
<b>It's time.</b>

05:32.400 --> 05:33.950
<b>Adding interest.</b>

05:42.330 --> 05:43.510
<b><i>Again.</i></b>

05:43.510 --> 05:45.130
<b><i>It doesn't hurt at all...</i></b>

05:46.010 --> 05:49.270
<b><i>Instead, I feel another power rush.</i></b>

05:49.990 --> 05:51.190
<b>It's time.</b>

05:51.190 --> 05:52.700
<b>Adding interest.</b>

05:55.270 --> 05:57.150
<b>It suddenly almost doubled?!</b>

05:57.150 --> 05:59.240
<b>That's because I just lent you</b>

06:00.110 --> 06:02.360
<b>another 180 aura.</b>

06:02.980 --> 06:05.420
<b><i>180 aura?</i></b>

06:05.710 --> 06:08.860
<b><i>What do these numbers mean?</i></b>

06:09.570 --> 06:12.930
<b>It seems you have no clue what I'm talking about.</b>

06:13.400 --> 06:18.440
<b>"180 aura" is a numeric measure 
of your spiritual power.</b>

06:19.310 --> 06:22.620
<b>Aura accumulates in the body,</b>

06:22.620 --> 06:25.530
<b>and your Maximum aura Output Potential (MOP)</b>

06:25.530 --> 06:26.890
<b>varies according to your training.</b>

06:28.800 --> 06:33.680
<b>Also, there is a limit on how much 
aura you're able to release at once,</b>

06:33.680 --> 06:36.450
<b>which can be raised through training.</b>

06:36.940 --> 06:37.830
<b>In other words,</b>

06:37.020 --> 06:42.230
<b>Present aura Output Potential [POP]</b>

06:37.830 --> 06:40.600
<b>your POP, the latent aura inside you, doesn't matter.</b>

06:40.600 --> 06:43.150
<b>If you haven't trained to increase your AOP,</b>

06:42.230 --> 06:45.450
<b>Present aura Output Potential [POP] 

Actualized aura Output Potential [AOP]</b>

06:43.150 --> 06:45.880
<b>the amount of aura you can actually release,</b>

06:45.450 --> 06:50.740
<b>1000 aura                                      200 aura</b>

06:45.880 --> 06:50.300
<b>you'll be at a huge disadvantage. Get it, fool?</b>

06:51.660 --> 06:56.130
<b>When you use <i>Ken</i>, you can sustain</b>

06:56.130 --> 06:58.680
<b>a maximum 1,800 aura around your body.</b>

06:59.480 --> 07:01.140
<b>When preparing for battle,</b>

07:01.140 --> 07:05.740
<b>you usually expend 1 aura per second.</b>

07:06.150 --> 07:08.860
<b>However, once the fight begins,</b>

07:08.860 --> 07:13.020
<b>you begin to use advanced techniques such as <i>Gyo, Ryu</i>, and <i>Ken</i>,</b>

07:13.020 --> 07:14.790
<b>which require considerable <i>Nen</i>.</b>

07:14.790 --> 07:18.800
<b>This increases the rate you expend 
aura by six to ten times.</b>

07:18.800 --> 07:23.650
<b>The stronger your techniques, 
the more aura you use up.</b>

07:23.650 --> 07:24.970
<b>Got that, fool?</b>

07:26.040 --> 07:28.140
<b>Your control is still weak,</b>

07:28.140 --> 07:30.920
<b>so you're burning 10 aura every second.</b>

07:30.920 --> 07:34.280
<b>That's 600 aura you expend per minute in battle.</b>

07:34.280 --> 07:38.530
<b>In yesterday's fight, you ran 
out after twenty minutes...</b>

07:38.530 --> 07:44.020
<b>So, in a regular fight, you used up 12,000 aura.</b>

07:45.810 --> 07:48.530
<b>Then add your four Jajankens!</b>

07:49.040 --> 07:52.600
<b>Your AOP is around 1,800 aura.</b>

07:52.600 --> 07:58.820
<b>But at the moment you called out "<i>Jan</i>" 
to activate Jajanken, the aura focused</b>

07:58.820 --> 08:00.610
<b>in your fist was over 2,000.</b>

08:01.920 --> 08:07.990
<b>That's due to its long charge and your defensive 
sacrifice, done to focus aura in your fist.</b>

08:07.990 --> 08:12.800
<b>A special provision covers such risks 
attributed to special attacks.</b>

08:13.180 --> 08:19.700
<b>You expended around 5,500 aura 
with the first three Jajanken shots!</b>

08:19.700 --> 08:23.950
<b>That puts your total consumed aura at 17,500.</b>

08:25.620 --> 08:27.500
<b>As for the fourth shot...</b>

08:28.040 --> 08:31.190
<b>Right before your do over hit, you ran out of energy.</b>

08:33.720 --> 08:38.550
<b>Assuming that you needed twice the 
usual aura amount to complete the attack,</b>

08:38.970 --> 08:41.980
<b>the fourth shot required 4,000 aura.</b>

08:42.580 --> 08:46.690
<b>The amount of aura used up is 
the same for Rock and Paper.</b>

08:46.690 --> 08:49.410
<b>However, Paper falls within a different category,</b>

08:49.410 --> 08:51.160
<b>and you haven't practiced much,</b>

08:51.160 --> 08:54.140
<b>so you used up 4,000 aura on a weak attack.</b>

08:54.140 --> 08:59.120
<b>That probably only had the strength 
of about a 500-aura attack.</b>

08:59.120 --> 09:02.890
<b>Thus, your maximum POP</b>

09:02.890 --> 09:06.130
<b>is around 21,500 aura!</b>

09:10.780 --> 09:13.740
<b>I wasn't expecting this kind of attack...</b>

09:15.630 --> 09:17.360
<b>Looks like you're not good at math.</b>

09:17.630 --> 09:20.320
<b>But I'm just getting started!</b>

09:20.320 --> 09:22.280
<b>Listen up, fool!</b>

09:23.830 --> 09:28.250
<b>When your borrowed aura, including interest,</b>

09:28.250 --> 09:31.210
<b>surpasses your current remaining POP,</b>

09:32.770 --> 09:35.200
<b>you'll bust.</b>

09:37.300 --> 09:39.610
<b>Aura works like a bank account balance.</b>

09:39.610 --> 09:41.600
<b>If you keep spending, your balance decreases...</b>

09:42.300 --> 09:45.150
<b>But the interest keeps skyrocketing!</b>

09:46.930 --> 09:49.980
<b>It's been a few minutes since we started.</b>

09:49.980 --> 09:52.570
<b>You've used up at least 2,000.</b>

09:53.210 --> 09:54.320
<b>Take a look.</b>

09:56.720 --> 09:57.920
<b>It's huge!</b>

09:57.920 --> 09:59.740
<b>That's not all...</b>

10:00.470 --> 10:03.490
<b>It's three times what it was before?</b>

10:04.580 --> 10:06.410
<b>That can't be right!</b>

10:06.410 --> 10:09.110
<b>It's only been two or three minutes!</b>

10:09.700 --> 10:12.150
<b>To be precise, it's been 120 seconds.</b>

10:12.150 --> 10:16.260
<b>This exemplifies how interest 
can snowball on you.</b>

10:23.040 --> 10:24.150
<b>It's time.</b>

10:24.870 --> 10:26.520
<b>Adding interest.</b>

10:30.890 --> 10:33.240
<b>Even after adding in the</b>

10:33.240 --> 10:36.320
<b>390 aura I've lent you, you're under 20,000.</b>

10:37.030 --> 10:39.740
<b>Your debt will continue to grow.</b>

10:39.740 --> 10:42.310
<b>Even if you stand perfectly still,</b>

10:42.310 --> 10:47.580
<b>in 260 seconds, or 4 minutes and 20 seconds,</b>

10:47.580 --> 10:48.820
<b>you'll bust.</b>

10:49.420 --> 10:51.670
<b>Bankrupt</b>

10:54.490 --> 10:56.210
<b>What happens if I bust?</b>

10:56.920 --> 10:59.550
<b>APR will become the 
Individual <i>Ren</i> Suppressor,</b>

11:00.140 --> 11:02.840
<b>and spend thirty days tracking the target.</b>

11:02.840 --> 11:06.060
<b>During that time, the target will 
remain in a state of <i>Zetsu</i>.</b>

11:06.560 --> 11:10.060
<b>Basically, unable to use any <i>Nen</i>.</b>

11:11.420 --> 11:14.300
<b>It's too late to regret fighting me now, fool!</b>

11:24.820 --> 11:27.950
<b><i>That's why he didn't use this ability earlier.</i></b>

11:29.710 --> 11:31.320
<b><i>He held back for my sake...</i></b>

<b>Knuckle!</b>

11:37.810 --> 11:38.810
<b><i>Thank you.</i></b>

<b>Here I come!</b>

11:49.940 --> 11:54.000
<b>That punch just now was around 150...</b>

11:55.860 --> 12:01.090
<b>You returned 150 to me,

12:03.370 --> 12:04.910
<b>What will you do now?</b>

12:05.880 --> 12:09.030
<b>Until your debt is repaid,</b>

12:09.030 --> 12:12.860
<b>I won't take damage from your attacks.</b>

12:15.040 --> 12:16.250
<b>It's time.</b>

12:17.370 --> 12:19.080
<b>Adding interest.</b>

12:21.430 --> 12:23.710
<b>Yeah, come at me, fool!</b>

12:23.710 --> 12:26.550
<b>If you just stand around, you'll bust

12:38.940 --> 12:41.070
<b>You managed to land more hits.</b>

12:41.730 --> 12:45.820
<b>But ultimately, you only returned about 100.</b>

12:46.720 --> 12:47.850

13:01.680 --> 13:04.400
<b><i>I won't let you launch Jajanken again.</i></b>

13:09.680 --> 13:10.990

<b><i>Wh-What is that?</i></b>

14:08.470 --> 14:10.190
<b><i>Can't let him intimidate me.</i></b>

14:11.110 --> 14:14.400
<b><i>Neither of us knows anything

14:16.000 --> 14:20.540
<b>I don't like hurting other people.</b>

14:22.480 --> 14:27.000
<b><i>That's why I chose a power that only activates</i></b>

14:27.000 --> 14:29.050
<b><i>when I must hurt someone.</i></b>

14:30.490 --> 14:33.060
<b><i>To give myself a weapon that only works</i></b>

<b><i>against those I have no qualms about hurting.</i></b>

14:38.740 --> 14:39.760
<b>However...</b>

14:55.730 --> 14:58.520
<b>You boys have taught me</b>

<b>that a worthy opponent deserves my full strength.</b>

15:04.870 --> 15:07.090
<b><i>Three hands?</i></b>

<b><i>How?</i></b>

15:09.510 --> 15:10.550
<b><i>They're floating?!</i></b>

15:11.060 --> 15:12.420
<b><i>What kind of power is this?</i></b>

15:13.160 --> 15:14.580
<b><i>Should I attack first?</i></b>

15:16.760 --> 15:17.890
<b><i>Stay calm...</i></b>

15:18.480 --> 15:20.220
<b><i>Observe the situation with</i> Gyo!</b>

15:25.530 --> 15:27.360
<b><i>He's not using </i>In.</b>

15:28.320 --> 15:30.360
<b><i>There are three floating hands.</i></b>

15:31.010 --> 15:31.860
<b><i>That means,</i></b>

15:32.480 --> 15:35.410
<b><i>most likely, he's a Manipulator.</i></b>

15:36.700 --> 15:38.620
<b><i>That cage is also a mystery.</i></b>

15:38.900 --> 15:41.050

<b><i>Touching those hands is dangerous!</i></b>

15:55.250 --> 15:57.140
<b><i>Yo-yos, huh?</i></b>

15:58.150 --> 16:00.430
<b><i>Let's see what you can do.</i></b>

16:22.240 --> 16:24.580
<b><i>He's amazingly adept...</i></b>

16:32.180 --> 16:33.190
<b><i>He's fast!</i></b>

16:34.010 --> 16:36.100
<b><i>Those hands were just a distraction?</i></b>

16:36.750 --> 16:38.100
<b><i>Jump back.</i></b>

16:44.200 --> 16:47.980
<b><i>When facing an enemy you

16:48.660 --> 16:51.610
<b><i>you fight on the premise of escaping.</i></b>

16:53.410 --> 16:54.110
<b><i>No way...</i></b>

16:54.760 --> 16:56.890
<b><i>That's no different from what I've always done.</i></b>

16:57.950 --> 16:59.000
<b><i>Use electricity!</i></b>

17:07.020 --> 17:08.500
<b><i>Couldn't get the attack off!</i></b>

17:09.250 --> 17:12.670
<b><i>My body won't listen to me...</i></b>

17:14.510 --> 17:15.510
<b><i>This...</i></b>

17:16.300 --> 17:17.560
<b><i>is my curse.</i></b>

17:18.410 --> 17:21.580
<b><i>His reaction was slow.</i></b>

17:22.340 --> 17:23.930
<b><i>Is something wrong?</i></b>

17:25.320 --> 17:27.300
<b><i>Stop... Don't think about it.</i></b>

17:27.900 --> 17:29.500
<b><i>It's my bad habit.</i></b>

17:29.500 --> 17:30.900
<b><i>His circumstances don't matter.</i></b>

17:30.900 --> 17:32.900
<b><i>Do my best to defeat him.</i></b>

17:33.740 --> 17:36.780
<b><i>Otherwise, I'm only insulting him!</i></b>

17:42.440 --> 17:44.410
<b><i>He's strong and fast.</i></b>

17:45.320 --> 17:48.420
<b><i>He probably has me beat in every area...</i></b>

17:52.030 --> 17:53.510
<b><i>That's right, Killua...</i></b>

17:53.510 --> 17:54.670
<b><i>That's the way.</i></b>

17:55.330 --> 17:57.840
<b><i>Don't fight an enemy you can't beat.</i></b>

17:59.060 --> 18:01.430
<b><i>I have to stop thinking that way!</i></b>

18:01.920 --> 18:06.440
<b><i>Your weakness is that you're 
too quick to give up.</i></b>

18:07.060 --> 18:09.290
<b><i>Even when facing enemies with equal strength,</i></b>

18:09.290 --> 18:13.200
<b><i>you worry about how strong they are, 
or what they might do to you.</i></b>

18:14.200 --> 18:17.710
<b><i>If we're talking about a stronger 
enemy, there's no question...</i></b>

18:17.710 --> 18:20.910
<b><i>You don't bother to think of how you could win.</i></b>

18:22.200 --> 18:25.950
<b><i>Running is your only option. 
That's how losers think.</i></b>

18:26.440 --> 18:28.240
<b><i>I realize that this isn't your fault.</i></b>

18:28.240 --> 18:31.190
<b><i>It's the fault of whoever taught you to fight.</i></b>

18:32.950 --> 18:37.220
<b><i>Habits that are burned into your 
body and soul aren't easy to break.</i></b>

18:39.830 --> 18:42.570
<b><i>Somewhere down the line, 
you'll leave Gon behind to die.</i></b>

18:46.940 --> 18:48.230
<b><i>Forget it.</i></b>

18:48.480 --> 18:50.730
<b><i>You can't win.</i></b>

18:56.370 --> 18:57.380
<b><i>My left eye?</i></b>

19:08.720 --> 19:10.270
<b><i>The left side of my face</i></b>

19:11.780 --> 19:12.880
<b><i>is gone...</i></b>

19:13.720 --> 19:16.150
<b>That was a much better reaction.</b>

19:16.840 --> 19:18.560
<b>Was what happened earlier a fluke?</b>

19:21.160 --> 19:23.170
<b><i>If you take damage without knowing why,</i></b>

19:23.170 --> 19:25.240
<b><i>get as far from the enemy as you can.</i></b>

19:26.090 --> 19:28.890
<b><i>My curse saved me.</i></b>

19:29.260 --> 19:31.850
<b><i>But that isn't good enough!</i></b>

19:34.300 --> 19:37.140
<b><i>Suppressing that bad habit and forcing yourself</i></b>

19:37.140 --> 19:41.910
<b><i>to face enemies stronger than 
you will take determination.</i></b>

19:43.140 --> 19:44.410
<b><i>I must fight to win!</i></b>

19:59.470 --> 20:01.050
<b><i>I'm blind on the left side...</i></b>

20:07.610 --> 20:08.810
<b><i>There it was again.</i></b>

20:09.940 --> 20:11.500
<b>You reacted quickly.</b>

20:11.500 --> 20:14.290
<b><i>No! I'm just running away!</i></b>

20:15.090 --> 20:19.320
<b><i>I haven't been fighting at all...</i></b>

20:20.290 --> 20:23.320
<b><i>If you can't defeat Shoot tomorrow,</i></b>

20:25.190 --> 20:27.280
<b><i>you must leave Gon's side!</i></b>

20:44.860 --> 20:45.970
<b><i>I'm done running away.</i></b>

20:50.210 --> 20:50.980
<b><i>Take this...</i></b>

20:53.150 --> 20:54.480
<b>Electricity?</b>

21:00.350 --> 21:01.490
<b>Scary.</b>

21:05.850 --> 21:07.740
<b><i>Doesn't matter... Follow him.</i></b>

21:08.270 --> 21:10.370
<b><i>Never overpursue.</i></b>

21:11.010 --> 21:12.020
<b><i>Go after him!</i></b>

21:25.490 --> 21:26.390
<b>How—</b>

21:26.390 --> 21:27.300
<b><i>Stop.</i></b>

21:30.680 --> 21:31.640
<b>...did you know?</b>

21:31.640 --> 21:33.150
<b><i>What am I asking that for?</i></b>

21:39.390 --> 21:41.200
<b>While Gon and Killua</b>

21:41.200 --> 21:45.570
<b>were fighting for the tokens...</b>

23:25.170 --> 23:27.590
<b>Next time: The Strong x And x The Weak.</b>

23:27.590 --> 23:28.720
<b>Here I come, Killua...</b>

23:28.720 --> 23:29.860
<b>Time to eat!</b>

23:29.860 --> 23:31.590
<b>Bring it!</b>

23:31.590 --> 23:33.250
<b>My yakiniku meal.</b>
