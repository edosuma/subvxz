<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:34.785 --> 00:37.004
Remember our old percolator?

00:36.995 --> 00:38.997
Now, <i>that</i> made a cup of coffee.

00:38.997 --> 00:41.716
If you want to open up
that can of worms,

00:41.708 --> 00:44.587
let's talk about
the old can opener.

00:50.092 --> 00:51.969
No, not the lawn!

00:51.969 --> 00:53.937
The lawn, boy, no!

00:54.846 --> 00:56.814
How many times have I told you,

00:56.807 --> 00:59.526
there are no dinosaur
bones under our yard!

00:59.518 --> 01:02.488
I'm doing extra credit
for my earth science class.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.982
We're learning about
all that these trees can do,

01:04.982 --> 01:08.236
like turning carbon dioxide
into oxygen.

01:08.235 --> 01:11.364
Yeah, and, uh, other stuff.

01:11.363 --> 01:12.615
Huh.

01:12.614 --> 01:14.992
Well, I wish
you'd asked permission,

01:14.992 --> 01:17.495
but it is a pretty good spot
for a tree.

01:17.494 --> 01:20.919
And the pecan tree
is the state tree of Texas.

01:20.914 --> 01:25.044
I limited myself to trees
that could be used to make pies.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.137
Well, let me
give you boys a hand.

01:27.129 --> 01:29.302
There's a new recipe
for backfill

01:29.298 --> 01:31.847
I've been meaning to try out.

01:31.842 --> 01:35.016
It's, uh, two parts compost.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.352
Okay, gather around, everybody!

01:41.351 --> 01:42.944
We're gonna play us
a little game!

01:44.271 --> 01:47.195
Highest card
wins Strickland Propane,

01:47.190 --> 01:49.943
all its assets and liabilities.

01:49.943 --> 01:50.944
A jack!

01:50.944 --> 01:52.287
All right, I'm in the mix!

01:52.279 --> 01:53.872
What's going on, sir?

01:53.864 --> 01:55.537
The last time
we played this game,

01:55.532 --> 01:58.001
Joe Jack got hit
with a paternity suit.

01:57.993 --> 02:00.291
It's fixing to get ugly
around here.

02:00.287 --> 02:03.131
The Bystander's about
to print a story claiming

02:03.123 --> 02:05.967
we've been illegally dumping
our old propane tanks

02:05.959 --> 02:07.256
in the Cottonwood River!

02:07.252 --> 02:08.252
What?

02:08.252 --> 02:09.253
Why would they say that?

02:09.253 --> 02:11.677
Because they're jackals!

02:11.673 --> 02:14.802
They're trying to fill
their news holes.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.144
And because they got proof.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.855
Dang it, Mr. Strickland,
I don't understand

02:18.847 --> 02:20.975
how you can be
Strickland's greatest asset

02:20.974 --> 02:22.726
and its greatest liability.

02:22.726 --> 02:23.978
Calm down.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.570
I didn't know it was illegal.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.532
I was trying to create
a coral reef,

02:28.523 --> 02:30.366
for all the dolphins
and whatnot.

02:30.359 --> 02:31.485
In a river?

02:31.485 --> 02:32.737
Everyone's gonna hate us.

02:32.736 --> 02:34.989
People hate people
who hate the environment.

02:34.988 --> 02:38.208
If we don't have an environment,
where will we do stuff?

02:38.200 --> 02:39.167
Think about it.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.502
Now, wait a minute.

02:40.494 --> 02:43.668
Mr. Strickland made
a bad decision that, for now,

02:43.664 --> 02:45.883
I am willing to believe
was an accident.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.217
We just need to show people

02:47.209 --> 02:49.632
that Strickland Propane
doesn't hate the environment.

02:49.628 --> 02:50.629
Hank,

02:50.629 --> 02:53.348
are you suggesting we go green?

02:53.340 --> 02:57.140
Well, I'd rather not
put it that way, but yes.

03:01.139 --> 03:03.392
Stop digging if you hit metal.

03:03.392 --> 03:06.942
My dad says there are a lot of
unexploded ordnances back here.

03:12.651 --> 03:13.994
Nice-looking tree, boys.

03:13.985 --> 03:14.952
Thanks.

03:15.112 --> 03:17.661
At first, it was all about
the extra credit.

03:17.656 --> 03:20.535
But now, I'm kind of glad
we're helping the planet.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.003
About that science teacher
of yours,

03:22.994 --> 03:26.339
does he ever talk about,
uh, going green?

03:26.331 --> 03:27.503
I don't know.

03:27.499 --> 03:29.968
Do you ever talk about propane?

03:29.960 --> 03:32.964
My point is, he talks
about it all the time.

03:32.963 --> 03:36.763
I don't suppose you remember any
of the things he said, do you?

03:36.758 --> 03:40.854
Dad, I have a bookbag full
of handouts you're gonna love.

03:41.847 --> 03:43.474
Hit the deck!

03:45.726 --> 03:49.481
My teacher says global warming
is serious business.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.982
Look at all the pictures
of the Statue of Liberty

03:51.982 --> 03:53.359
at the bottom of the ocean.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.446
Okay, Bobby, let's skip
to the nuts and bolts.

03:57.446 --> 03:58.447
Right.

03:58.447 --> 04:01.246
It says here
a healthy planet starts

04:01.241 --> 04:03.209
with turning off
your screen saver

04:03.201 --> 04:04.953
when you leave your workstation.

04:05.120 --> 04:09.091
But my flying toasters
keep me happy!

04:12.502 --> 04:13.719
Huh.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.965
This is not all
California nonsense.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.966
Some of it's common sense stuff,

04:17.966 --> 04:21.516
like recycling and using
more efficient light bulbs.

04:21.511 --> 04:22.979
And, Mr.
Strickland,

04:22.971 --> 04:25.520
about that little fridge
you keep in your office...

04:25.515 --> 04:28.564
I am not drinking
a warm longneck!

04:28.560 --> 04:30.858
Well, at least put
the door back on.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.447
Fine.

04:34.483 --> 04:36.531
Thanks for carpooling, you guys.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.745
I know it's not
everybody's first choice,

04:38.737 --> 04:40.410
but it's important
for the company.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.157
Hey, I'm psyched, man!

04:42.157 --> 04:44.535
Now we finally have
a chance to talk,

04:44.534 --> 04:48.164
I mean, really talk,
about our hopes and our fears.

04:48.163 --> 04:49.836
Uh, who wants to go first?

04:50.999 --> 04:52.717
Hang in there, Mr. Strickland.

04:52.709 --> 04:53.926
We'll be there soon.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.979
Now, if you're not
gonna let me have

05:12.979 --> 05:15.698
my own little bottles of water,
then we're all drinking

05:15.690 --> 05:16.987
raspberry ice!

05:20.654 --> 05:23.908
We better turn that dang air on,
or I'm going pant-less.

05:23.907 --> 05:24.999
I'm sorry, Buck.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.995
I don't know how to say
this diplomatically,

05:27.994 --> 05:29.541
but you made a mistake,

05:29.538 --> 05:32.633
and, well, fixing it
is not gonna be fun.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.803
Buck needs to be more vigilant.

05:43.802 --> 05:46.271
He put up a banner
saying we went green.

05:46.263 --> 05:49.517
That's like a contract
with everyone who drives by.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.610
Buck could always
take the easy way out

05:51.601 --> 05:53.603
and just buy carbon offsets.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.446
They're all the rage
in Hollywood.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.236
That's the dream factory, Hank.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.701
What the heck
is a carbon offset?

05:59.693 --> 06:02.242
It's like
a "get out of jail free" card

06:02.237 --> 06:04.285
for people concerned
about the environment,

06:04.281 --> 06:07.160
but not concerned enough
to actually do anything.

06:07.158 --> 06:10.958
You simply pay someone to
plant trees or build windmills

06:10.954 --> 06:13.082
to offset all the carbon
you've dumped on the Earth.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.628
That's ridiculous.

06:14.624 --> 06:17.969
You can't cause a problem
and ask someone else to fix it.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.679
You have to do the work
yourself,

06:19.671 --> 06:21.969
like Bobby and Joseph
over there.

06:21.965 --> 06:23.763
What?

06:23.758 --> 06:24.884
Joseph doesn't work.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.974
Well, normally Bobby
doesn't either,

06:26.970 --> 06:29.849
but look at them,
working for free.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.566
You really got to admire that.

06:31.558 --> 06:32.559
Huh.

06:32.559 --> 06:35.529
You most certainly do.

06:41.359 --> 06:42.952
Oh, yeah!

06:43.987 --> 06:45.830
Hello, Dale.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.291
I assume you're just here
for a quick visit

06:48.283 --> 06:50.706
since you're taking up
two parking spaces.

06:50.702 --> 06:54.047
Your friend here just sold me
a mess of carbon offsets.

06:54.039 --> 06:55.256
You did what?

06:55.248 --> 06:56.875
Good news, Hank.

06:56.875 --> 06:59.173
I'm in the carbon offset
business.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.804
No, this isn't the way
to show customers we've changed.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.346
We have a plan.

07:06.343 --> 07:09.563
Sure, it's tedious and
unpleasant, but it will work.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.977
Yeah, yeah, we gave your plan
a fair shot, ol' top.

07:11.973 --> 07:13.566
It was time to cut our losses.

07:13.558 --> 07:14.980
It was one clay.

07:14.976 --> 07:17.525
Hank, this is a dream come true.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.865
All the sanctimony
without all the effort.

07:33.328 --> 07:34.375
Ah.

07:34.371 --> 07:36.339
Smells like money.

07:41.169 --> 07:42.295
Say, ol' top,

07:42.295 --> 07:44.969
that truck of yours
is quite the gas guzzler.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.593
How many offsets
can I put you down for?

07:47.592 --> 07:49.936
You can put me down
for kicking your ass!

07:49.928 --> 07:52.977
What kind of stupid
got-dang idea is this?

07:52.973 --> 07:55.226
This is the perfect plan.

07:55.225 --> 07:57.523
Strickland agreed
to let me plant the trees

07:57.519 --> 07:59.192
on some land he isn't using;

07:59.187 --> 08:01.485
Bobby and Joseph agreed
to do the planting;

08:01.481 --> 08:03.233
and I agreed to take the money.

08:03.233 --> 08:06.988
Buying carbon offsets isn't
gonna fix Strickland's image.

08:06.987 --> 08:07.988
It's just cheating.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.706
Who's to say what's cheating?

08:09.698 --> 08:12.952
Is Leonardo DiCaprio cheating
when he offsets

08:12.951 --> 08:14.453
riding around in a private jet?

08:14.452 --> 08:15.248
Yes.

08:16.246 --> 08:19.591
Oh, Hank, you just don't get it.

08:27.716 --> 08:30.344
Planting carbon offsets
is great!

08:31.845 --> 08:34.644
I feel like I can
already breathe better.

08:34.639 --> 08:35.982
Whew!

08:35.974 --> 08:37.942
I guess this is what happens
when God gets lazy

08:38.101 --> 08:40.820
and humans have to pick up
the slack.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.985
What else do you need
me to do for you?!

08:42.981 --> 08:45.985
Look, I know
we're tired and irritable...

08:45.984 --> 08:47.486
Shut up, kid!

08:47.485 --> 08:49.988
This is important.

08:49.988 --> 08:52.332
I think we should buckle down
and keep working.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.620
Who's with me?!

08:53.616 --> 08:56.119
You're talking so loud,
of course I'm in!

09:02.000 --> 09:04.594
Octavio, I have a job for you.

09:04.586 --> 09:05.929
Bring your shovel.

09:06.087 --> 09:07.964
Oh, sorry, Mrs. Octavio.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.716
You sound just like him.

09:11.301 --> 09:13.395
Welcome to Strickland Propane.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.764
The banner outside
says you're green.

09:15.764 --> 09:18.187
What exactly are you doing
for the environment?

09:18.183 --> 09:19.435
Well, quite a bit.

09:19.434 --> 09:21.528
We have an employee carpool,

09:21.519 --> 09:24.318
all our invoices are printed
on recycled paper,

09:24.314 --> 09:25.907
and as you can tell,

09:25.899 --> 09:28.698
the temperature in here
is slightly uncomfortable.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.991
You're burying
the lead, ol' top.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.240
Tell her about
the carbon offsets.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.866
I don't think

09:34.866 --> 09:36.994
she really wants
to hear about, uh...

09:36.993 --> 09:39.462
Trees! Beautiful trees.

09:39.454 --> 09:42.082
I'm planting a forest
of majestic oaks

09:42.082 --> 09:43.834
and pines and whatnot.

09:43.833 --> 09:47.337
And those trees are eating up
all that nasty carbon.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.964
I respect that.

09:48.963 --> 09:51.967
It's the next best thing
to us never having existed.

09:51.966 --> 09:55.846
It's money out of my pocket, but
I'm doing it for the children.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.939
You see, I got a kid somewhere.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.566
So do I!

09:59.557 --> 10:02.436
Well, I find
that hard to believe.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.980
You take
the next customer, Hank.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.574
I'm gonna handle
this one... personally.

10:11.986 --> 10:14.990
I'm so excited to
start planting today!

10:14.989 --> 10:17.833
I can't wait to see if
this blister's gonna hold on.

10:17.826 --> 10:20.670
Kids, I've decided
that instead of planting,

10:20.662 --> 10:23.632
you should focus
on selling carbon offsets.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.967
Wouldn't we be doing
more good for the planet

10:25.959 --> 10:27.427
if we were planting trees?

10:27.418 --> 10:31.468
Octavio and I have
the planting covered.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.091
Okay-

10:35.135 --> 10:37.263
We're gonna run
out of trees soon, <i>esé</i>.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.559
Should we go buy some more?

10:38.555 --> 10:40.728
We got all the trees
we need, Octavio.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.566
I mean, who knows
how many carbons

10:42.559 --> 10:44.311
are soaked up by a single tree.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.529
17? 30 billion?

10:46.521 --> 10:49.991
This one's pretty leafy,
but, you know,

10:49.983 --> 10:50.984
I don't know, dude.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.577
Nobody does!

10:52.569 --> 10:54.287
So go get some lunch.

10:59.951 --> 11:02.329
I don't care where
your school is going.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.205
I'm not buying any more candy.

11:04.205 --> 11:07.300
We're selling carbon offsets,
Mr. Souphanousinphone.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.636
Now, I can pretty this up
for you

11:09.627 --> 11:12.426
and tell you there's
plenty of air to go around,

11:12.422 --> 11:14.971
but I see
that you're a smart man,

11:14.966 --> 11:16.968
and you'd see
right through that.

11:16.968 --> 11:19.266
You can keep ruining the world
and stuff,

11:19.262 --> 11:21.981
and these offset thingies
make it okay.

11:21.973 --> 11:25.978
This make me feel better
about taking 40-minute showers.

11:25.977 --> 11:28.105
It's my "me" time.

11:29.314 --> 11:30.987
<i>Look at all these trees I sold.</i>

11:30.982 --> 11:33.986
Everyone in the neighborhood
bought offsets.

11:33.985 --> 11:36.955
Oh, Bobby, it is so nice
to see you thinking

11:37.113 --> 11:38.490
you're making a difference.

11:38.489 --> 11:41.242
You know who bought
the most offsets of anyone?

11:41.242 --> 11:42.994
Mr. Strickland.

11:42.994 --> 11:44.962
The way to win
back our customers

11:44.954 --> 11:48.504
is by making minor adjustments
to our daily regimen

11:48.499 --> 11:52.129
that, over time, can make
a quantifiable difference.

11:52.128 --> 11:55.257
Wow, Dad, between
all the dull stuff you're doing

11:55.256 --> 11:57.304
and the exciting stuff
I'm doing,

11:57.300 --> 11:59.723
we're going to save the world!

12:00.803 --> 12:02.225
Oh, my God.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.896
This is so random;
I buy offsets, too.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.268
They are so important.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.895
I just saw a documentary
about Antarctica.

12:09.062 --> 12:12.612
If all the ice melts,
where will the penguins dance?

12:12.607 --> 12:14.609
So true.

12:14.609 --> 12:15.986
We have to go.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.237
We're in a band,
and we're on our way

12:17.237 --> 12:19.956
to Nashville
for the Earth Benefit Concert.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.242
Wait, wait, wait!

12:22.242 --> 12:25.212
You shouldn't be burning
all that awful carbon

12:25.203 --> 12:27.171
by driving up to Nashville.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.961
No, not when I'm organizing

12:28.957 --> 12:31.927
one of them earthy benefit
concerts right here in Arlen.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.929
Wow, you really get it.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.637
Yeah, it'll be like Woodstock.

12:37.632 --> 12:40.351
Y'all like mud, don't you?

12:57.819 --> 13:00.163
Channel 84? Oh, God,

13:00.154 --> 13:01.997
what else did they find
in the river?

13:01.990 --> 13:03.913
They can't look in my locker
unless they're cops,

13:03.908 --> 13:05.125
right, honey?

13:06.786 --> 13:10.256
This earthy concert's going
to put us over the top, ol' top.

13:10.248 --> 13:13.127
We'll never have to worry
about our reputation again.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.969
We got to hurry
and wrap this up, suge.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.430
There's a dog nursing
baby kittens across town.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.424
Mr. Strickland,
you used to pollute,

13:19.424 --> 13:20.971
but now you give a hoot.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.969
Tell us how that happened.

13:22.969 --> 13:26.473
I have sinned,
but I am a changed man.

13:26.472 --> 13:30.818
I fell hard for a lovely lady
named Mother Earth.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.939
And like any man in love,
I want the whole world to see

13:34.105 --> 13:36.984
my beautiful woman
and her trees.

13:36.983 --> 13:39.532
That's why I'm sponsoring
a benefit concert

13:39.527 --> 13:43.953
two weeks from Saturday,
in majestic Strickland Woods!

13:47.702 --> 13:49.830
<i>A benefit concert.</i>

13:49.829 --> 13:52.252
That is one smart way
to pull Strickland's <i>huevos</i>

13:52.248 --> 13:53.795
out of the frying pan.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.964
I have found that live music
will make people

13:55.960 --> 13:57.837
overlook anything.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.214
Sting must do horrible things

13:59.213 --> 14:01.807
for all the special concerts
that man puts on.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.723
Well, I can't believe the kinds
of people I had to deal with

14:04.719 --> 14:06.972
all week
getting this concert going.

14:06.971 --> 14:09.440
Apparently,
right when you get out of jail,

14:09.432 --> 14:11.651
you start renting port-a-johns.

14:11.642 --> 14:13.235
I sold so many trees,

14:13.227 --> 14:15.980
they should call Strickland
Woods "Strickland Forest."

14:15.980 --> 14:18.324
Well, congratulations, Bobby.

14:18.316 --> 14:21.320
You just put out your
first Mr. Strickland fire.

14:21.319 --> 14:23.947
A couple hundred more
and you'll be tied with me.

14:34.624 --> 14:36.251
Where are all the trees?

14:36.250 --> 14:37.797
I don't know.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.967
Mr. Gribble said he'd take care
of the planting

14:39.962 --> 14:42.636
and for me to just worry
about the selling.

14:42.632 --> 14:44.509
Well, on the bright side,

14:44.509 --> 14:47.934
this is the scandal that will
finally take Buck down.

14:56.979 --> 15:00.233
Dale, we were just at Strickland
Woods and there's nothing there.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.951
How could you do this?

15:01.943 --> 15:04.992
Well, I liked the money, but
didn't care for the digging.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.456
After that the plan
sort of formed itself.

15:07.448 --> 15:10.748
Buck's been telling everybody
he's planted a forest out there.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.212
This was supposed to save
Strickland's image.

15:13.204 --> 15:15.332
In my defense, things
get awfully muddy

15:15.331 --> 15:17.959
when it comes
to the environment.

15:17.959 --> 15:20.963
Hybrid cars get worse mileage
than older regular cars.

15:20.962 --> 15:23.135
Ethanol causes food prices
to go up

15:23.131 --> 15:24.974
and leads to riots
in other countries.

15:24.966 --> 15:26.809
We were supposed to have
an ice age

15:26.801 --> 15:28.974
unless people stopped
using pesticides.

15:28.970 --> 15:31.644
Well, looky here.
It's still hot!

15:31.639 --> 15:33.482
I'm not letting you
destroy the company

15:33.474 --> 15:35.568
I've dedicated my life to.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.358
You're going to go
and tell everyone

15:37.353 --> 15:39.196
that you lied
and stole their money.

15:39.188 --> 15:42.283
I'm kind of in the middle
of a beer, Hank.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.653
Aah!

15:44.652 --> 15:46.996
And this is where
I'll be hobnobbing

15:46.988 --> 15:48.205
with all the celebrities.

15:48.197 --> 15:51.246
I call it the Green Green Room.

15:51.242 --> 15:52.368
Uh-huh.

15:52.368 --> 15:53.995
Then I get lowered
onto the stage

15:53.995 --> 15:57.795
by a helicopter powered
by vegetable oil.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.043
Go on, Dale. Tell them
about the trees.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.669
Yeah, about them,

16:01.669 --> 16:03.671
some of those trees
might have to, you know,

16:03.671 --> 16:06.675
quietly disappear to
make room for a stage.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.768
Well, that's not going
to be a problem, sir.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.181
There are no trees.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.974
Dale took your money
and didn't plant anything.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.817
Excuses, Hank...
Tell him the excuses.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.482
I got thousands of people...

16:18.478 --> 16:20.151
Including some very
attractive females...

16:20.146 --> 16:23.366
Expecting music and trees!

16:23.357 --> 16:24.984
We're in trouble.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.828
We need a brainstorming
session, pronto.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.993
Well, how about we tell everyone
the truth?

16:29.989 --> 16:32.242
How about we simulate
a forest with one tree

16:32.241 --> 16:33.868
and a thousand mirrors?

16:33.868 --> 16:35.245
Well, now there's someone
using his noodle.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.588
Hank, you're out.
Gribble, what else you got?

16:55.473 --> 16:57.396
So this fellow's
going to save us, huh?

16:57.391 --> 16:58.859
How do you know him, again?

16:58.851 --> 17:01.946
He used to be in the gun club
until we kicked him out.

17:01.938 --> 17:05.407
He kind of scared us;
he's way into guns.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.534
Hey, Gribble.

17:11.531 --> 17:12.999
How's your gun club?

17:12.990 --> 17:15.242
Geez, let it go already.

17:15.242 --> 17:18.463
Eh, nice piece of property
you got here.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.001
What is she, a hundred acres?

17:19.997 --> 17:21.123
She's not for sale.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.625
Oh, we don't want to buy it.

17:22.625 --> 17:25.549
We want to buy the carbon offset
rights to your trees.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.887
You can't cut down my trees.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.597
No, no, you don't understand.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.512
We want these trees
to keep doing

17:30.508 --> 17:32.727
exactly what they're doing...

17:32.718 --> 17:33.970
Inhaling carbon

17:33.970 --> 17:35.313
and exhaling oxygen.

17:35.304 --> 17:38.979
And we want to pay you for it,
for the environment.

17:38.975 --> 17:41.398
How is paying me going to help
the environment?

17:41.394 --> 17:42.395
Well, hell if I know.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.692
The important thing is

17:43.688 --> 17:45.986
nothing's going to change
and you get paid.

17:45.982 --> 17:48.360
I think we can work
something out.

17:48.359 --> 17:50.327
Fantastic.

17:50.319 --> 17:51.787
Oh, yeah,

17:51.779 --> 17:53.406
and there's going to be
a concert here this weekend.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.659
Should be a few thousand people,
not a big deal.

17:59.328 --> 18:02.002
Buck and Dale
are just making things worse.

18:01.998 --> 18:05.969
Now they've bought offset rights
to a forest that already exists.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.553
It doesn't matter anyway.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.639
People just want to make money.

18:09.630 --> 18:12.133
Caring is for suckers.

18:15.344 --> 18:17.392
Bobby is too young
to know that, Hank.

18:17.388 --> 18:18.890
We have to do something.

18:20.182 --> 18:23.561
Hey, it looks like your pecan
tree could use a little water.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.780
What's the point?

18:41.370 --> 18:43.464
I told you it'd work, ol' top.

18:43.456 --> 18:46.380
Nobody knows where the real
Strickland Woods is.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.968
Yep, it certainly looks like

18:47.960 --> 18:50.588
you're going to get
away with this, sir.

18:52.089 --> 18:53.841
Uh, how you all doing out there?

18:55.968 --> 18:57.845
We're all here to have
a good time,

18:57.845 --> 19:01.224
but let's not forget
the real reason we're here:

19:01.223 --> 19:02.725
me!

19:02.725 --> 19:04.272
I'm just like the Indian

19:04.268 --> 19:06.316
who saw pollution
in that old commercial;

19:06.312 --> 19:07.985
except instead of crying,

19:07.980 --> 19:10.779
I got off my ass
and did something about it.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.988
That's why I planted
all these trees.

19:17.448 --> 19:20.201
Aw, I'm not a hero,

19:20.201 --> 19:21.578
no, not at all.

19:21.577 --> 19:24.000
I'm just one man who's trying

19:23.996 --> 19:26.124
to single-handedly save
the planet.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.588
Uh, sir, one of the
girls in the band

19:31.587 --> 19:34.431
needs help with her costume.

19:34.423 --> 19:37.893
Excuse me, folks.
I got some hobnobbing to do.

19:38.052 --> 19:40.726
Hello, I'm Hank Hill.

19:40.721 --> 19:44.316
Now, you're all here because
you care about the environment.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.403
- The environment!
- That's right.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.989
And that's why you deserve
the truth.

19:49.980 --> 19:52.278
And, uh, the truth is,

19:52.274 --> 19:55.574
these trees have been here
a long time.

19:57.363 --> 20:01.459
No, no. You see, Strickland
Propane didn't plant them.

20:01.450 --> 20:05.000
We just bought the offset rights
to them, whatever that means.

20:08.332 --> 20:11.461
What I'm trying to say is,
we did nothing.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.178
Leave only footprints!

20:16.257 --> 20:19.887
Strickland! Strickland!
Strickland!

20:25.349 --> 20:28.899
Ladies and gentlemen,
Big Mountain Fudge Cake.

20:38.863 --> 20:41.992
And these stakes should support
the tree in any strong winds.

20:41.991 --> 20:45.791
It'll be turning out oxygen
and pecans for years to come.

20:45.786 --> 20:50.007
Thanks, Dad, but I don't see
how one tree is going to matter.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.967
Well, I'm not going to lie
to you, Bobby.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.961
One tree probably won't matter.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.963
Oh, okay.

20:55.963 --> 20:58.967
But if you care about something,
you can make a difference.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.718
Don't let people
who take shortcuts

21:00.718 --> 21:04.848
or only do something because
it's fashionable discourage you.

21:04.847 --> 21:06.315
I won't.

21:07.975 --> 21:10.899
So what's the ETA on
that first pecan pie?

21:11.061 --> 21:14.406
Uh, it's going to be
a little while, Bobby.

21:53.229 --> 21:55.948
<i>Trees! Beautiful trees.</i>
