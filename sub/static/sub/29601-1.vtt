01:28.971 --> 01:30.128
Mom...

01:31.830 --> 01:33.302
Dad won't let me visit.

01:35.740 --> 01:37.950
He says you don't want
to see me right now.

01:41.036 --> 01:42.677
I don't believe him.

01:44.978 --> 01:46.146
I miss you.

08:45.398 --> 08:47.500
Can I tell you about my dream?

08:50.069 --> 08:51.838
You have already started.

08:58.211 --> 08:59.980
There were these two people...

09:04.183 --> 09:05.385
...a man...

09:11.124 --> 09:12.459
...and a woman.

09:19.598 --> 09:22.268
And they were grabbing
at each other.

09:30.209 --> 09:31.377
And...

09:33.246 --> 09:36.217
I couldn't... I couldn't
tell the difference...

09:38.150 --> 09:40.353
...between the two of them.

09:44.491 --> 09:47.524
You know, when you were young,

09:47.526 --> 09:50.463
I thought you would
never stop growing.

09:53.533 --> 09:54.869
Look at you now.

09:58.203 --> 09:59.606
Like your mother.

10:48.355 --> 10:50.021
It's okay.

10:50.023 --> 10:52.623
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah.

10:52.625 --> 10:53.992
One, two, three.

11:27.226 --> 11:28.629
- Here we go.
- Okay.

13:20.640 --> 13:22.775
I'm so sorry about your dad.

13:48.268 --> 13:50.700
Too bad about the rain.

13:50.702 --> 13:53.406
You need a hand
bringing this stuff in?

13:54.473 --> 13:56.327
- I got it.
- All right.

13:56.329 --> 13:57.710
How much for the pipe?

14:01.780 --> 14:03.250
Ten cents.

14:05.385 --> 14:06.819
I knew your dad.

14:09.722 --> 14:11.390
I'm Dr. Fiennes.

14:12.792 --> 14:14.795
You can call me Wallace.

14:20.199 --> 14:21.398
Or Wally.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.402
That's what the girls call me.

14:28.540 --> 14:30.974
I was one of your mother's...

14:30.976 --> 14:32.478
physicians.

14:46.693 --> 14:48.395
How much for that?

14:50.663 --> 14:52.529
What is it, anyway?

14:52.531 --> 14:54.864
It's a planchette.

14:54.866 --> 14:56.837
It's French for "little plank."

14:57.803 --> 15:00.707
It's an old parlor game.

15:03.443 --> 15:06.847
People used to think
that spirits talked through it.

15:15.020 --> 15:17.424
Go ahead,
put your fingers on it.

15:52.759 --> 15:54.428
Can I go see her?

15:55.361 --> 15:56.830
Can't do that.

15:58.497 --> 16:00.833
Or what I mean to say is that...

16:03.403 --> 16:05.404
I don't work there anymore.

16:05.938 --> 16:07.307
So...

16:08.607 --> 16:11.277
I can't get you access to her.

16:14.414 --> 16:19.553
But I'm sure... I'm sure
she's comfortable there.

16:27.860 --> 16:32.095
I'm about to go out
on the road for a bit.

16:32.097 --> 16:33.964
You know what I could use?

16:33.966 --> 16:37.337
Somebody to give me a hand
carrying stuff...

16:38.837 --> 16:40.573
...and taking photos.

16:47.713 --> 16:48.814
Okay.

16:53.819 --> 16:55.820
There we go.

16:55.822 --> 16:57.291
Oh!

16:58.591 --> 17:01.428
"You will see
the great pyramids of Egypt."

17:03.496 --> 17:05.498
That would be kind of nice.

17:12.971 --> 17:14.440
What's it say?

17:19.611 --> 17:20.714
What's it say?

17:53.979 --> 17:55.980
That's the Polaroid Land Camera.

17:55.982 --> 17:58.719
Pop that... Pop that button.

18:01.120 --> 18:02.986
There you go.

18:02.988 --> 18:05.188
Then take a look at the insides.

18:05.190 --> 18:07.090
An aperture,

18:07.092 --> 18:11.094
aperture is
the mechanical opening

18:11.096 --> 18:12.832
behind the lens.

18:15.467 --> 18:18.836
And if you were to close
that thing down to...

18:18.838 --> 18:20.574
let's say f/11...

18:22.707 --> 18:24.908
...you'd be shutting out
a lot of light.

20:24.996 --> 20:26.863
Andy?

20:52.158 --> 20:53.659
See this woman?

20:56.762 --> 20:58.262
Look at the woman.

20:58.264 --> 21:00.132
The woman's in distress.

21:01.333 --> 21:02.902
I'm gonna help her.

21:05.137 --> 21:06.873
Now we take her picture.

21:35.266 --> 21:36.902
Next slide, Andy.

21:48.648 --> 21:49.683
Next.

21:57.756 --> 21:58.757
Next.

22:30.890 --> 22:32.324
I like pictures.

22:35.026 --> 22:38.198
They were scheduled.
I don't know where they are.

23:04.156 --> 23:05.825
Get your camera.

23:19.037 --> 23:20.239
Take your time.

23:29.047 --> 23:30.315
Take your time.

23:47.832 --> 23:48.901
Thank you, Andy.

25:13.185 --> 25:15.789
Is that what you did
to my mother?

25:29.067 --> 25:32.271
Nice part of
the world you got around here.

26:01.199 --> 26:03.065
In some instances...

26:05.204 --> 26:06.602
...the best...

26:12.210 --> 26:15.078
...the best that can be done

26:15.080 --> 26:17.513
for the family...

26:17.515 --> 26:21.251
is to return the patient to them
in an innocuous state.

26:33.465 --> 26:35.064
I-N-N...

26:36.502 --> 26:38.204
O-C...

26:39.505 --> 26:43.106
U-O-U-S.

30:10.515 --> 30:13.683
So you wanna do like this...

30:13.685 --> 30:17.323
and like this, and sometimes
the nose will swell.

30:18.923 --> 30:23.560
So... there's that. I see
a little discoloration here.

30:23.562 --> 30:25.665
And you want to account
for that.

30:26.864 --> 30:29.398
Now, the family...

30:29.400 --> 30:31.534
often sees the patient
in this condition

30:31.536 --> 30:32.936
shortly after the procedure,

30:32.938 --> 30:36.542
before healing and swelling
has gone down.

30:37.242 --> 30:38.644
We help them.

30:40.545 --> 30:42.648
And then we take their picture.

30:44.650 --> 30:45.717
Okay?

30:49.655 --> 30:50.690
Have a seat.

32:08.600 --> 32:09.733
Here we go.

32:10.669 --> 32:12.702
Okay, okay.

32:21.545 --> 32:23.545
Did it go down?
Did I knock it down?

32:23.547 --> 32:27.317
Well, sometimes it goes down
just like that.

32:27.319 --> 32:29.285
Come here. Come here.

32:39.831 --> 32:43.369
A Tom Collins for
the young photographer there.

32:43.869 --> 32:45.702
Okay.

32:45.704 --> 32:46.936
Here we go.

34:54.697 --> 34:56.831

Dr. Fiennes.

37:46.271 --> 37:48.738
I'm curious if you have
any thoughts on Chlorpromazine.

37:48.740 --> 37:50.740
The new drug.
The FDA has just approved it?

37:50.742 --> 37:52.874
- I know about it.
- A lot of people say

37:52.876 --> 37:56.012
it's a more humane variation
of the procedure you perform.

37:56.014 --> 37:58.751
Do they? A lot of people say?

38:00.885 --> 38:03.086
The approach that best benefits
the hospital,

38:03.088 --> 38:06.689
the institutions, the patients,
and the patients' families,

38:06.691 --> 38:09.294
that's gonna be the one
that's gonna stay with us.

38:59.343 --> 39:01.744
Why are they screaming?

39:09.753 --> 39:10.919
Does it work?

39:14.025 --> 39:15.825
Is it dangerous?

39:28.907 --> 39:30.707
Are you waiting?

39:35.979 --> 39:38.448
When I left home,

39:38.450 --> 39:40.416
it was last winter.

39:42.220 --> 39:45.421
Last time I saw my boy,
he was in the snow.

39:49.227 --> 39:51.928
I told him to come inside.

39:51.930 --> 39:53.028
You know?

39:54.832 --> 39:58.166
He was...
just stood there, shivering.

40:09.314 --> 40:10.847
What did you do?

40:16.354 --> 40:18.921
I picked him up
and brought him in.

40:24.028 --> 40:25.762
Goddamn it.

40:31.436 --> 40:34.303
Give me a towel.

40:34.305 --> 40:35.805
Goddamn it.

40:43.981 --> 40:45.981
Get her off the fucking table.

40:45.983 --> 40:48.917
All right,
put her on the gurney.

40:52.956 --> 40:54.792
Okay. Carefully.

40:55.860 --> 40:58.827
- But quickly.
- One, two, three.

40:58.829 --> 41:00.095
Let's go, let's go.

41:07.070 --> 41:08.506
Let's do another.

41:11.041 --> 41:12.207
Thank you.

41:58.222 --> 41:59.622
Hello?

42:07.197 --> 42:08.631
Hello?

42:21.211 --> 42:22.979
Can we speak to my mother?

42:36.394 --> 42:38.461
It worked for me before.

42:42.133 --> 42:43.401
Yeah, well...

42:48.606 --> 42:49.608
Yeah.

43:02.220 --> 43:03.956
Where do they go?

43:05.490 --> 43:07.426
Where does who go?

43:08.626 --> 43:10.195
People.

43:11.195 --> 43:12.631
After you change them.

44:06.651 --> 44:10.255
These are thankful people.
You know.

44:12.023 --> 44:13.521
Where's the thanks?

44:13.523 --> 44:15.157
Hm?

44:15.159 --> 44:17.292
No fucking thanks...

44:17.294 --> 44:21.365
This. Here we go.
Here, grateful people.

44:22.566 --> 44:25.503
Thankful. Where's the thanks?

44:26.137 --> 44:27.372

46:57.188 --> 46:59.921

47:01.825 --> 47:02.925

51:12.443 --> 51:14.443
Hello. Don't worry, darling.

51:14.445 --> 51:16.979
They can fix the furniture.

51:16.981 --> 51:18.981
What are you drinking?

51:18.983 --> 51:22.584
A Shirley Temple,
with a bunch of rum in it.

51:38.501 --> 51:40.035
So, what do you do?

51:41.972 --> 51:43.475
Take pictures.

51:44.707 --> 51:46.577
You're a photographer?

51:49.479 --> 51:50.711
Yeah.

52:02.059 --> 52:03.794
My grandfather...

52:05.195 --> 52:07.863
A brilliant man

52:07.865 --> 52:10.802
of great stamina...

52:12.035 --> 52:14.570
Longevity.

52:14.572 --> 52:19.443
He was the first American
surgeon to remove a brain tumor.

52:20.577 --> 52:24.012
It's absolutely true.
He did it...

52:24.014 --> 52:25.713
with his fingers.

52:26.717 --> 52:28.115
I'm not kidding.

52:28.117 --> 52:31.620
And this is before
the advent of X-rays.

52:31.622 --> 52:34.256
And he did it
in an operating theater

52:34.258 --> 52:38.129
without electric light.

52:39.128 --> 52:41.162
He's still alive.

52:41.164 --> 52:43.865
Can you imagine?
My grandfather.

52:43.867 --> 52:45.469
And you know what?

52:46.604 --> 52:49.640
That's him right there.
Grandpa. Grampy?

52:52.041 --> 52:53.108
Grampy?

52:54.845 --> 52:56.711
Oh, Grampy.

52:56.713 --> 53:00.150
Oh, it's so sad.
He's still got to work. Okay.

53:01.885 --> 53:04.852
You never introduced
yourself, I mean, by name.

53:04.854 --> 53:08.155
I didn't?
What the heck is the matter with me?

53:08.157 --> 53:11.462
I blame you entirely.
This is Andy.

53:12.729 --> 53:16.030
Andy here is
a fine portrait photographer.

53:16.032 --> 53:18.267
- So I hear.
- He's so good, in fact,

53:18.269 --> 53:21.303
that he could make you look...

53:21.305 --> 53:23.872
more beautiful
than you already are.

53:27.010 --> 53:28.776
And what do you do?

54:11.889 --> 54:14.957
Don't tell me
you're that man's son.

54:14.959 --> 54:16.624
No, I'm not.

54:16.626 --> 54:19.596
Why do you hang
around with him then?

54:27.137 --> 54:29.070
He knows my mother.

54:29.072 --> 54:32.743
Ah. Mother's friend.

54:34.144 --> 54:35.747
They're not friends.

54:38.282 --> 54:40.285
Where's your mother now?

54:50.760 --> 54:52.195
In the hospital.

54:53.896 --> 54:55.766
What kind of hospital?

54:59.869 --> 55:01.638
A state hospital.

55:04.775 --> 55:06.408
Hey...

55:06.410 --> 55:08.880
my daughter's
in the hospital too.

55:11.280 --> 55:14.082
She got that from her father.

55:14.084 --> 55:15.753
I have it too, but...

55:17.655 --> 55:20.155
I have the guts to live with it
in the world,

55:20.157 --> 55:22.894
and her daddy has
no fucking guts at all.

55:32.769 --> 55:36.338
Have you ever been touched
by a woman?

55:36.340 --> 55:39.242
I mean besides your mother
when you were a baby?

56:25.889 --> 56:27.888
So where to next?

56:31.095 --> 56:32.426
What?

56:34.164 --> 56:35.896
You and your doctor friend...

56:35.898 --> 56:37.765
where are you going next?

56:39.769 --> 56:41.503
Mount Shasta.

56:41.505 --> 56:43.104
Mount Shasta.

56:45.976 --> 56:47.441
Of course you are.

56:49.246 --> 56:51.079
What do you mean?

56:54.084 --> 56:56.318
Tell Susan...

56:56.320 --> 56:58.120
Mommy said, "Hi."

58:07.191 --> 58:08.359
Hey!

58:10.227 --> 58:11.392
- Hello.
- Hello.

58:11.394 --> 58:13.930
I've seen you in the magazines.

58:16.265 --> 58:18.233
What's, uh, what's your name?

58:18.235 --> 58:19.934
Jack.

58:19.936 --> 58:21.805
I need your service.

58:28.211 --> 58:30.447
All right. Okay, hold on.

58:34.584 --> 58:38.356
Hi. Excuse me. You look like
somebody who should know.

58:39.923 --> 58:42.193
Since we've been here...

58:44.193 --> 58:48.329
I'm sorry.
The Board has sided with the opinion

58:48.331 --> 58:49.930
that it should be discontinued,

58:49.932 --> 58:52.334
or at least weighed
against other options

58:52.336 --> 58:54.472
like Chlorpromazine.

58:58.140 --> 59:01.211
Then, um, why the invitation?

59:02.012 --> 59:04.278
Pardon me?

59:04.280 --> 59:07.481
I said why the invitation?
You invited me.

59:07.483 --> 59:10.822
- You invited me...
- No, I don't think we did.

59:18.128 --> 59:20.595
I don't understand.

59:20.597 --> 59:23.231
Why don't you try St.
Jude's Hospital?

59:23.233 --> 59:25.503
They may be more open to it.

01:01:32.095 --> 01:01:33.794
Here you go.

01:02:01.358 --> 01:02:03.691
Do you hear voices?

01:02:03.693 --> 01:02:06.528
I wouldn't call them that.

01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:08.162
Okay.

01:02:08.164 --> 01:02:09.497
If you wouldn't call them
voices,

01:02:09.499 --> 01:02:11.435
what would you call them?

01:02:12.769 --> 01:02:14.505
Sounds.

01:02:16.173 --> 01:02:18.573
And what do they say?

01:02:18.575 --> 01:02:21.779
I already told
you they don't say anything.

01:02:24.247 --> 01:02:25.649
I apologize.

01:02:27.784 --> 01:02:30.387
What sounds do they make?

01:02:52.142 --> 01:02:53.811
They sound like that.

01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:58.381
Or like this.

01:03:29.646 --> 01:03:31.282
Can you smile?

01:03:59.709 --> 01:04:02.279
Just gonna ask you
some more questions.

01:04:26.802 --> 01:04:29.405
How long were you
institutionalized?

01:04:49.925 --> 01:04:53.663
Have you received
electroshock therapy before?

01:05:07.943 --> 01:05:09.679
I've met your mother.

01:05:30.934 --> 01:05:32.535
Hello.

01:07:42.698 --> 01:07:44.030
We're ready.

01:08:31.481 --> 01:08:33.113
There you go.
I'm going to take you down.

01:08:33.116 --> 01:08:34.582
Ready, one, two...

01:08:34.584 --> 01:08:38.586
You're gonna go down on
the table. And... down.

01:10:51.754 --> 01:10:53.156
You want a ride?

01:11:55.418 --> 01:11:57.918
How did you get in?

01:12:01.290 --> 01:12:02.890
The door was open.

01:12:38.428 --> 01:12:40.427
You like my things?

01:12:56.912 --> 01:12:58.044
You like that?

01:13:06.022 --> 01:13:07.421
You know what it is?

01:13:14.162 --> 01:13:15.895
A painting.

01:13:25.441 --> 01:13:27.074
Where did you get it?

01:13:29.911 --> 01:13:32.046
Get it?

01:13:32.048 --> 01:13:34.914
Where did I get it?

01:13:57.973 --> 01:14:00.074
You look confused.

01:14:04.045 --> 01:14:06.079
What confuses you?

01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:11.945
My dad had one.

01:15:14.116 --> 01:15:16.186
Huh?

01:15:19.955 --> 01:15:21.490
A painting.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.199
A picture.

01:15:43.112 --> 01:15:45.078
He was a figure skater.

01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:50.263
Can you look at me?

01:18:51.567 --> 01:18:53.499
Can you look at the camera?

01:19:11.286 --> 01:19:12.819
Get the fuck off me!

01:19:12.821 --> 01:19:16.590
Get the fuck off!
Get the fuck off me!

01:19:19.094 --> 01:19:21.095
Get the fuck off!

01:19:21.097 --> 01:19:23.230
Get the fuck off me!

01:19:23.232 --> 01:19:24.631
Get the fuck...

01:20:20.789 --> 01:20:22.922
Get off me!

01:20:22.924 --> 01:20:25.324
Get the fuck off me!

01:20:27.929 --> 01:20:30.797
Get the fuck off me!

01:20:39.808 --> 01:20:42.676
Get the fuck off me!

01:21:26.254 --> 01:21:28.257
You wanna go home?

01:21:33.329 --> 01:21:34.796
No.

01:21:44.473 --> 01:21:46.543
Do you hear voices?

01:21:50.278 --> 01:21:51.548
No.

01:21:55.718 --> 01:21:58.952
Do you have lust...

01:21:58.954 --> 01:22:00.423
for women?

01:22:02.957 --> 01:22:04.791
Yes.

01:22:04.793 --> 01:22:07.429
Do you have lust for men?

01:22:14.670 --> 01:22:17.707
Was Susan your first...

01:22:18.706 --> 01:22:20.410
...sexual encounter?

01:22:29.817 --> 01:22:31.320
Yes.

01:22:36.724 --> 01:22:38.891
Do you hear voices?

01:22:41.830 --> 01:22:43.297
No.

01:22:46.735 --> 01:22:50.936
Do you believe that your dreams

01:22:50.938 --> 01:22:53.573
are imaginary?

01:22:54.942 --> 01:22:57.843
Or that they're real?

01:23:05.454 --> 01:23:06.852
Real.

01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:16.829
Do you believe that the voice...

01:23:16.831 --> 01:23:19.833
that speaks through
the pencil and the wood

01:23:19.835 --> 01:23:24.037
is a... real voice?

01:23:32.447 --> 01:23:33.946
Yes.

01:23:36.751 --> 01:23:39.685
Do you believe
that it is your mother?

01:23:50.832 --> 01:23:52.099
Yes.

01:25:33.701 --> 01:25:35.437
Hi there.

01:25:42.577 --> 01:25:44.977
I've made an arrangement
with that man.

01:25:44.979 --> 01:25:46.245
Susan's father.

01:25:46.247 --> 01:25:47.717
Remember that man?

01:26:02.129 --> 01:26:05.865
You're gonna rest
up here today...

01:26:05.867 --> 01:26:07.868
and then tomorrow morning

01:26:07.870 --> 01:26:10.872
I'm gonna take you
over to his house.

01:26:11.939 --> 01:26:13.608
More comfortable there.

01:26:15.911 --> 01:26:17.447
Andy?

01:26:24.853 --> 01:26:26.522
You've cleared the hurdle.

01:27:03.125 --> 01:27:04.891
So go on in.

01:27:04.893 --> 01:27:07.260
And, uh...

01:27:07.262 --> 01:27:09.194
I'll see you in a second.

01:28:29.411 --> 01:28:31.747
Let's go!

01:28:52.901 --> 01:28:53.702
Okay.

01:28:57.772 --> 01:28:59.342
Close your eyes.

01:29:04.079 --> 01:29:05.880
Let's breathe.

01:29:10.152 --> 01:29:12.288
Let it out of the body.

01:29:18.226 --> 01:29:21.897
And... into the body.

01:29:26.902 --> 01:29:28.237
And...

01:29:29.937 --> 01:29:32.340
...out of the body.

01:29:35.110 --> 01:29:36.911
And...

01:29:38.946 --> 01:29:40.915
...into the body.

01:34:08.616 --> 01:34:09.952
