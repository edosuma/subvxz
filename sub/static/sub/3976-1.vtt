01:00.477 --> 01:04.807
There are places in my neighborhood
no one ever thinks about.

01:06.316 --> 01:09.816
You see them every day
and every day you forget about them.

01:10.153 --> 01:15.163
These are the places where all the things
happen that people are not allowed to see.

01:16.994 --> 01:20.834
You see, in Brooklyn,
money changes hands all night long.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.421
It's just not the kind
you can deposit in a bank.

01:25.002 --> 01:28.882
All that money
needs to end up somewhere.

01:29.673 --> 01:31.513
They call it a drop bar.

01:32.342 --> 01:35.262
A bar the bosses choose randomly
each night...

01:35.512 --> 01:38.352
...to be the safe for an entire city.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.943
You never know up front
when your bar becomes the drop bar.

01:43.187 --> 01:45.517
You just take all the city's dirtiest money...

01:45.772 --> 01:49.942
...and bag men come and go
from all over town...

01:50.194 --> 01:54.534
...and nobody ever sees it coming.
Nobody ever sees it going.

01:57.534 --> 02:02.044
And then they could tell you
to be the drop bar next week.

02:03.207 --> 02:05.877
Or maybe even next year.

02:07.711 --> 02:10.550
The point is, you never know.

02:11.715 --> 02:13.215
In the meantime...

02:13.550 --> 02:14.880
...me...

02:16.386 --> 02:18.386
...I just tend bar.

02:19.056 --> 02:20.386
And wait.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.480
Bobby, you want to sprinkle the infield
with the general?

02:29.733 --> 02:31.903
This is fucking awesome.
We spend $80 million...

02:32.152 --> 02:37.162
...to drag a bunch of Jersey geriatrics
across the river to wet-shit their depends.

02:38.617 --> 02:39.777
The old guard.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.326
They're not that old.

02:41.620 --> 02:44.460
You see Stackhouse block lebron
with his Walker?

02:44.498 --> 02:46.168
Gentlemen, these are on the house.

02:48.627 --> 02:50.997
When he speaks, he says nice things.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.967
Rardy, can you clean that up?

02:54.007 --> 02:55.677
Okay, if it's for Richie.

02:55.968 --> 02:57.798
You got new pants, Sully?

02:57.845 --> 02:59.515
Yeah, I'll send them to the dry cleaners.

02:59.805 --> 03:01.975
-Rardy, we're not thanking you.
-Fuck you.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.845
Fucking sphinx, that guy.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.808
-Cousin Marv, thanks for the drink.
-Thanks, Marv.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.150
Shall we say something for the kid?

03:12.192 --> 03:14.492
-Sully, go ahead.
-Yeah, Sully, do it up.

03:17.489 --> 03:22.159
Richie "glory days" whelan. Fort Hamilton,
class of '92 and a funny prick.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.542
May he rest in peace.

03:23.829 --> 03:25.499
Glory days.

03:26.999 --> 03:28.329
Fucking a.

03:33.172 --> 03:34.512
Let me guess.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.180
You bought them the round.

03:37.676 --> 03:40.176
Yeah. They're only...

03:41.180 --> 03:46.180
They're celebrating the anniversary
of a very close friend, Marv.

03:47.352 --> 03:50.062
The kid's been dead, what...10 years now?

03:50.564 --> 03:55.244
Ought to be a point where you move on.
Stop scoring free drinks off a corpse.

03:55.527 --> 03:59.737
Speaking of which, stop letting her ride
a stool all night and not pay for her drinks.

04:00.032 --> 04:02.032
-Who, Millie?
-Yeah, Millie.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.544
She doesn't drink that much.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.752
When's the last time you charged her?

04:07.039 --> 04:08.869
It's Millie, you know.

04:11.877 --> 04:15.507
After midnight, you let her smoke in here
even though it's illegal.

04:15.547 --> 04:16.877
You think I didn't know that?

04:17.132 --> 04:21.642
If she can't pay her tab tonight,
she don't come back in here till she does.

04:21.887 --> 04:24.557
Her bar tab is, like, 120 bucks.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.386
It's about $140.

04:26.642 --> 04:28.232
But she can't afford it, you know?

04:28.477 --> 04:31.977
Yeah, I'm gonna start crying now. Okay?

04:34.399 --> 04:37.399
And get all the candy canes
and Christmas shit down.

04:37.653 --> 04:40.323
It's December 27th. Come on.

04:40.739 --> 04:41.739
Gentlemen.

04:42.074 --> 04:43.914
Why don't you go fuck yourselves?

05:11.436 --> 05:12.936
...hallowed be thy name.

05:13.272 --> 05:16.782
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

05:17.109 --> 05:19.109
Give us this day our daily bread.

05:19.361 --> 05:23.281
Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
those who trespass against us.

05:23.532 --> 05:26.872
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.120
Peace be with you.

05:33.959 --> 05:34.959
Peace be with you.

05:36.295 --> 05:37.635
Peace be with you.

05:38.380 --> 05:39.380
Body of Christ.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.970
The body of Christ.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.473
The body of Christ.

05:48.140 --> 05:49.470
The body of Christ.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.355
That's not good.

06:44.029 --> 06:45.699
What are you doing in there?

06:51.036 --> 06:53.536
All right. All right, now.

06:56.875 --> 06:59.375
Hey. What are you doing in my trash?

06:59.711 --> 07:02.551
You have a dog in your trash can.

07:02.881 --> 07:04.881
It's a boxer.

07:08.887 --> 07:10.217
Jesus.

07:10.722 --> 07:13.562
You have a dog here in your trash.

07:24.736 --> 07:26.566
This one's bleeding.

07:27.739 --> 07:30.239
-What's your name?
-Bob saginowski.

07:30.284 --> 07:31.414
Let me see your license.

07:31.743 --> 07:36.753
My license? My wallet is in my pocket.
You'll have to take it out.

07:49.428 --> 07:52.098
I just sent that picture to four people.
We clear?

07:53.599 --> 07:56.479
-He's freezing.
-Yeah, well, it's cold.

07:56.768 --> 07:58.598
Let's bring him inside.

08:05.444 --> 08:07.284
I'm Nadia, by the way.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.162
Is it bad?

08:13.118 --> 08:15.158
It's not that deep, but, man.

08:15.454 --> 08:18.964
Someone beat the shit out of this dog.
See these knots?

08:18.999 --> 08:21.669
That's not skull, that's contusions.

08:22.127 --> 08:23.457
Are you a vet?

08:24.129 --> 08:27.299
No, I'm a waitress at the ashmont grill.

08:27.674 --> 08:30.644
But I worked at animal rescue
one summer as a tech.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.299
Careful.

08:32.971 --> 08:36.981
They're so hard, this breed.
To find them a home.

08:37.643 --> 08:39.143
Boxers?

08:39.186 --> 08:41.306
This isn't a boxer. It's a pit bull.

08:43.482 --> 08:44.822
That's a dangerous dog.

08:46.318 --> 08:48.988
It's not the dog's fault his owner is a dick.

08:49.655 --> 08:50.995
This guy...

08:51.323 --> 08:52.993
...look at him.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.329
He's nothing but sweet.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.710
You'll need a crate--makes them feel safe.
I have one you can borrow.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.724
And food and chew toys and stuff.

09:09.007 --> 09:14.007
But I was, I was just passing a garbage can.
I can't--

09:14.346 --> 09:17.846
-I'll just take him back.
-To who? The guy who beat him?

09:17.891 --> 09:19.891
I'll take him to the proper authorities.

09:20.185 --> 09:22.015
That would be the shelter.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.062
Right.

09:23.689 --> 09:28.029
After they give the owner seven days
to reclaim him, if he decides not to...

09:28.068 --> 09:30.068
...this dog will be put up for adoption.

09:30.362 --> 09:33.912
But who knows
what kind of person will take him?

09:36.201 --> 09:37.371
I don't know.

09:38.036 --> 09:40.366
You can take him. You take him.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.714
I work nights. I work a lot.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.923
We'll have to send him to animal rescue.

09:45.210 --> 09:47.880
Okay, look, can you, can you...

09:47.921 --> 09:50.721
...give me a couple days to think about it?
Please?

09:51.049 --> 09:54.009
I have to think about this.
It's a big responsibility.

09:54.052 --> 09:55.892
I don't know anything about--

09:55.929 --> 09:58.599
please, just a couple days. I'll come back.

09:58.891 --> 10:01.891
Please, a couple days.
Hold him till the weekend.

10:02.227 --> 10:06.227
Just the weekend. It's a couple days.
Please. Please.

10:08.192 --> 10:09.282
Saturday morning.

10:10.611 --> 10:11.901
Thank you.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.914
All right. Thank you.

10:18.619 --> 10:19.949
Saturday.

10:20.412 --> 10:21.582
Bob?

10:21.830 --> 10:23.830
-The dog needs a name.
-Right.

10:26.919 --> 10:28.589
Oh, my God.

10:35.761 --> 10:37.551
You're going to be okay.

10:37.596 --> 10:41.096
Do you know a Nadia Dunn? Nadia Dunn?

10:41.767 --> 10:43.097
You don't?

10:44.186 --> 10:45.186
You don't?

10:45.437 --> 10:46.437
No.

10:46.688 --> 10:49.268
That's the girl who's holding the dog.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.778
The dog again.

10:52.027 --> 10:55.447
You know, I was thinking
that training a dog...

10:55.781 --> 10:58.951
...housebreaking, and all that, that's...

10:59.618 --> 11:03.618
...I mean, that is
a huge responsibility, right?

11:04.623 --> 11:06.123
Well, it's a dog.

11:07.793 --> 11:11.553
It's not like some long-lost retarded
relative shows up in a wheelchair...

11:11.797 --> 11:14.127
...a colostomy bag hanging out of his ass.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.643
Says, "I'm yours now. Take care of me."

11:18.470 --> 11:19.800
It's not that.

11:20.138 --> 11:21.468
It's a dog.

11:30.816 --> 11:32.146
Yeah.

11:43.954 --> 11:45.124
What?

11:46.540 --> 11:47.620
What?

11:48.041 --> 11:49.041
No.

11:50.294 --> 11:52.304
It's a fucking bad idea.

11:52.546 --> 11:55.376
We should hit it for everything or not at all.

11:55.632 --> 11:59.052
Little brother, listen.
My guy says we got to show him...

11:59.303 --> 12:00.893
...that we can handle our shit.

12:00.929 --> 12:04.309
Says we do it in steps.
See how the owners respond.

12:04.558 --> 12:07.388
They could respond
pretty fucking bad, you nut.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.061
So that's what we'll see.

12:12.065 --> 12:16.735
Your guy. Your fucking guy
talks a whole hell of a lot.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.195
It's a fucking drop bar.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.910
Not tonight it isn't.

12:25.746 --> 12:26.906
Okay?

12:28.749 --> 12:29.919
Okay.

12:58.237 --> 13:00.237
Don't think about it, just fill it.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.619
Okay, we won't cause any trouble.

13:03.909 --> 13:05.409
You're making trouble!

13:05.786 --> 13:08.286
-Do you know what the fuck you're doing?
-Marv.

13:08.622 --> 13:09.962
Do you know whose money this is?

13:10.249 --> 13:11.619
Fucking fill the bag!

13:13.460 --> 13:14.630
All right.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.458
Just take it easy.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.144
There you go.

13:29.768 --> 13:30.938
Go ahead.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.150
You fucking talk too much.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.786
Where's rardy?

13:51.832 --> 13:53.002
Rardy?

13:53.333 --> 13:54.673
What the fuck?

13:54.960 --> 13:58.460
-You all right?
-Oh, God, I'm gonna be sick.

13:59.298 --> 14:01.798
-I'm okay.
-Look at his head.

14:03.010 --> 14:05.010
Split open. We got to call an ambulance.

14:05.304 --> 14:08.644
That's bad. Rardy, don't move.
Just stay where you are.

14:08.891 --> 14:12.391
-How bad do I look?
-Don't move. It's not good.

14:16.064 --> 14:18.074
I'm putting something on your head.

14:19.234 --> 14:20.574
Hold that.

14:22.237 --> 14:23.907
There's one for your face.

14:30.078 --> 14:32.748
The 8 o'clock at St. dom's.

14:33.582 --> 14:36.252
Every morning we see each other
and we've never met.

14:36.585 --> 14:40.765
-Detective evandro Torres.
-Hi. I'm Bob saginowski.

14:42.257 --> 14:44.677
-A shame about St. dom's.
-What do you mean?

14:44.927 --> 14:49.427
I just found out they're folding it
into St. Mary's. Can you believe that?

14:49.848 --> 14:50.848
I did not know that.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.599
-You're the bartender?
-Yeah.

14:52.851 --> 14:55.101
The guys with the guns--
want to take a walk?

14:55.854 --> 14:59.274
They sound like anyone
who ever came in here before?

14:59.608 --> 15:03.858
Nah. The guy closest to me,
I could see that his watch had stopped.

15:04.613 --> 15:09.623
Officer Bernardo says you said they were
covered head to toe? Hoodies, masks?

15:09.868 --> 15:13.538
Yeah, but I could see his wrist
as it was turning.

15:13.789 --> 15:17.129
The face of the watch
was in front of me, like that.

15:17.459 --> 15:19.789
-And it was stopped?
-Yeah. It said 6:15.

15:20.796 --> 15:22.046
How much they take you for?

15:22.297 --> 15:24.467
Well, whatever was in the register.

15:24.883 --> 15:28.053
So, if I was to ask around,
I wouldn't hear anything about...

15:28.303 --> 15:32.143
...anyone making book here,
or someone moving money around?

15:32.391 --> 15:33.561
Excuse me?

15:33.809 --> 15:35.479
-I wouldn't hear that?
-Nah.

15:36.228 --> 15:38.898
-Do you have insurance, rardy?
-What do you think?

15:39.147 --> 15:41.147
No, we don't have insurance.

15:41.733 --> 15:44.743
-The whole thing's a travesty.
-Yeah, he took a pretty bad hit.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.987
Nah, I meant St. dom's.

15:47.322 --> 15:48.322
Yeah. Yeah.

15:48.574 --> 15:51.244
Beautiful church. They did mass right.

15:51.493 --> 15:55.663
No group hugs after the our father.
No folk singers.

15:56.081 --> 15:58.751
By the time the seculars get done
persecuting the church...

15:59.001 --> 16:02.751
...all we'll have left is a bunch of condos
with stained glass windows.

16:03.505 --> 16:05.835
What's up with
the surveillance cameras in there?

16:06.091 --> 16:08.841
They don't record.
They're just a deterrent for crime.

16:09.094 --> 16:10.684
Why don't you take communion?

16:12.848 --> 16:14.178
Excuse me?

16:14.516 --> 16:17.516
I've seen you at mass for years.
You haven't taken communion once.

16:20.689 --> 16:23.359
Well, you know, that's my business.

16:23.942 --> 16:25.362
You think so, huh?

16:30.365 --> 16:32.365
Yeah, I think so.

16:32.618 --> 16:34.698
Jesus. I fucking know so.

16:40.626 --> 16:42.706
So was he gonna let you
wear his letter jacket...

16:42.753 --> 16:45.553
...or did he have to twist your nipples
a few times first?

16:46.632 --> 16:49.972
Why the fuck would you tell that cop
about the watch?

16:50.219 --> 16:52.389
-I don't know.
-You don't know.

16:52.638 --> 16:53.638
It just came out.

16:53.889 --> 16:57.559
Well, next time, why don't you
nip that impulse in the bud?

16:57.809 --> 16:59.479
What the fuck is wrong with you?

16:59.728 --> 17:01.808
It was very unlike me, Marv.

17:03.565 --> 17:06.065
They took us for
five thou and some change.

17:06.401 --> 17:07.741
Five thousand?

17:09.655 --> 17:12.994
Thank God they picked up the envelope,
so we're not on the hook for that.

17:13.242 --> 17:15.582
So we're all right. We're okay.

17:16.744 --> 17:20.244
No, they took us for
five large and some change.

17:20.915 --> 17:23.076
It's their bar, it's their money.

17:23.417 --> 17:27.417
They're going to want it back.
So we're not so fucking okay.

17:33.095 --> 17:34.185
Bob?

17:35.681 --> 17:37.351
-You all right?
-Yeah.

17:37.599 --> 17:42.099
-Kind of early for the eight.
-Yeah. I figured I could wait.

17:42.437 --> 17:44.607
Well, come on in.

18:17.139 --> 18:19.139
It's just a bowl and some food.

18:19.391 --> 18:20.811
Thank you. Thank you.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.313
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

18:56.845 --> 19:00.015
You know, I've never owned a dog before...

19:00.349 --> 19:02.179
...so, you know...

19:03.852 --> 19:07.192
I have no idea what I'm doing. At all.

19:07.856 --> 19:10.186
You'll need bowls.

19:12.528 --> 19:13.858
A leash.

19:16.865 --> 19:18.865
Poop bags.

19:21.703 --> 19:25.873
And from now on,
keep your shoes up on a shelf.

19:27.042 --> 19:30.552
Let me see if I can find the bed section.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.050
What do you want?

19:37.719 --> 19:41.889
This is the best book I know.
You should read it.

19:46.144 --> 19:48.154
Everything is in here.

19:56.154 --> 19:57.494
What are you naming him?

19:57.739 --> 20:02.079
Well, I was thinking about maybe rocco.
I like the name rocco.

20:02.327 --> 20:04.157
But then I thought Mike.

20:04.913 --> 20:06.253
Mike?

20:06.582 --> 20:11.092
-You don't like Mike?
-No. Mike is not a great name for a dog.

20:11.753 --> 20:13.253
Rocco is better.

20:13.922 --> 20:15.092
Okay.

20:16.258 --> 20:19.258
So did they name you Nadia
after the gymnast?

20:19.511 --> 20:21.511
-Yeah.
-So you're a gymnast?

20:21.763 --> 20:22.933
No.

20:25.767 --> 20:27.597
Here you go. See?

20:27.936 --> 20:30.936
"Rocco". Hey, he likes it.

20:31.273 --> 20:32.773
Yeah, I like Mike.

20:39.615 --> 20:40.955
-You have him?
-Yeah.

20:43.285 --> 20:44.455
Be patient.

20:45.287 --> 20:46.787
Bye, thank you.

21:05.641 --> 21:12.611
"Make sure the bottoms of the two
side panels rest inside the bottom."

21:23.659 --> 21:25.329
Hey, rocco?

21:26.328 --> 21:28.498
I made you a safe place.

21:50.853 --> 21:52.023
Bob?

21:55.524 --> 21:57.034
Cold one, huh?

21:59.027 --> 22:01.987
Who needs snow blower
when you have Bob?

22:02.030 --> 22:03.700
Maybe you come to my house later.

22:04.700 --> 22:05.870
Sure.

22:06.702 --> 22:07.872
I'm kidding.

22:08.203 --> 22:09.453
This guy.

22:11.456 --> 22:12.536
You on the welfare?

22:12.791 --> 22:13.961
Excuse me?

22:14.209 --> 22:16.459
Bob does all the work. You watch.

22:16.712 --> 22:18.382
No, I was shoveling.

22:18.630 --> 22:20.630
-You're shoveling, all right.
-He was.

22:21.383 --> 22:22.553
Come.

22:46.241 --> 22:47.581
You know this guy?

22:48.911 --> 22:49.911
No.

22:50.162 --> 22:51.832
But I know this guy.

22:54.499 --> 22:56.329
Moment I know him, I know him.

22:59.087 --> 23:01.087
Somebody robbed my bar.

23:01.590 --> 23:05.260
Yes. That's right. I'm sorry, Mr. umarov.

23:06.345 --> 23:08.265
Call my father Mr. umarov.

23:08.514 --> 23:09.514
Bob...

23:10.098 --> 23:11.768
...call me chovka, eh?

23:12.017 --> 23:16.017
That's right, I'm sorry, Mr. chovka,
somebody did rob your bar.

23:16.271 --> 23:17.771
Who robbed our bar?

23:18.106 --> 23:20.356
We don't know. They wore masks.

23:20.609 --> 23:22.609
That's right. So we couldn't see.

23:22.861 --> 23:25.781
Police report says
one wore a broken watch.

23:25.822 --> 23:26.912
You tell them this?

23:26.949 --> 23:31.869
Yeah, I did. I wasn't thinking.
It just came out.

23:32.120 --> 23:35.710
So what are you doing
to get my father's money back?

23:35.958 --> 23:37.628
Well, we put the word out.

23:37.876 --> 23:39.786
-In the neighborhood.
-That's right.

23:40.128 --> 23:42.958
They got the word out in the neighborhood.

23:44.216 --> 23:46.216
So the word is out there, huh?

23:46.468 --> 23:48.138
-The word.
-That's right.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.390
With my money.

23:53.058 --> 23:55.308
Find my fucking money.

24:09.825 --> 24:11.585
"Find my money."

24:13.328 --> 24:17.668
If we knew where their money was,
it would mean we knew who robbed us.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.460
Which would mean we were in on it,
which means they'd shoot us in the face.

24:21.503 --> 24:23.003
Fucking chechnyans.

24:24.006 --> 24:26.006
Chechens, Marv.

24:29.511 --> 24:32.511
They're from chechnya,
but you call them chechens.

24:32.764 --> 24:34.104
Yeah, chechnya.

24:34.349 --> 24:39.349
I said that. You don't call people
from Ireland irelandians, do you?

24:39.605 --> 24:41.695
What the fuck are you talking about?

24:49.114 --> 24:52.284
Yo, yo. What's the sunset
nightcap this evening?

24:52.534 --> 24:56.044
-You bring your own cup?
-What, I just got out of the womb?

24:59.291 --> 25:01.041
-Cheers.
-Salud.

25:02.711 --> 25:03.711
So what up, evandro?

25:03.962 --> 25:05.802
You remember Marvin stipler?

25:06.048 --> 25:07.298
Cousin Marv?

25:07.341 --> 25:10.301
He got pushed off his own book,
nine, ten years ago, by the chechens.

25:10.552 --> 25:15.222
His bar got held up. It's owned by
one of papa umarov's shell companies.

25:15.557 --> 25:17.767
What kind of dumb-ass
holds up one of his bars?

25:17.809 --> 25:18.889
You got me.

25:20.062 --> 25:22.312
Major crimes up on the umarovs?

25:22.564 --> 25:24.654
We barely survived the last budget cuts.

25:24.900 --> 25:29.240
We're not sticking our heads up to go after
some Russian John q barely knows exists.

25:29.488 --> 25:30.488
Chechen.

25:31.406 --> 25:33.576
You want him, he's all yours.

25:42.751 --> 25:45.091
Hey, baby brother, you ready to eat?

25:48.090 --> 25:50.510
-What?
-Are you ready to eat?

25:51.260 --> 25:52.430
No.

25:52.761 --> 25:54.721
I ate already.

25:54.763 --> 25:57.103
-I ate already.
-When did you eat?

25:58.100 --> 25:59.430
I ate.

26:09.778 --> 26:12.608
Oh, no. Hey, hey, no.

26:13.115 --> 26:15.125
Rocco, stay there. Stay.

26:15.784 --> 26:17.124
Don't do it.

26:17.619 --> 26:20.289
Don't do it. Don't jump.

26:24.459 --> 26:26.459
Crikey Jesus.

26:27.129 --> 26:28.629
That was close.

26:29.298 --> 26:31.628
You gave me a heart attack.

26:42.561 --> 26:44.731
-Where the fuck you been?
-Getting here.

26:46.815 --> 26:48.145
-You got the money?
-No.

26:49.318 --> 26:52.818
-What do you mean, no?
-I mean no 'cause fucking bri has it.

26:53.071 --> 26:54.241
Bri has it.

26:55.073 --> 26:57.493
-Did you tell your brother about me?
-No.

26:57.743 --> 26:59.493
Why the fuck you hit rardy so hard?

26:59.745 --> 27:01.415
-I had to.
-You had to.

27:01.663 --> 27:04.923
And I had to call an ambulance.
So there's an ambulance and cops.

27:05.250 --> 27:06.500
What's with his watch?

27:06.752 --> 27:11.262
People noticed it's broke. Tell him
to get a new one and get rid of that one.

27:11.673 --> 27:12.843
Today.

27:15.594 --> 27:19.604
What's the next step?
When do we hit a real drop bar?

27:19.848 --> 27:23.348
Let's just assume I'm not some asshole
without a plan, okay?

27:23.602 --> 27:26.442
When an airplane goes down, what's
the safest airline to fly the next day?

27:27.022 --> 27:28.692
The one that had the crash.

27:29.024 --> 27:30.364
Right. There you go.

27:30.609 --> 27:31.779
So we just wait.

27:32.027 --> 27:34.987
I don't understand
a fucking word you're saying.

27:35.030 --> 27:36.360
It's like you're speaking Brazilian.

27:36.698 --> 27:38.698
Just let me take care of it, okay?

27:39.284 --> 27:40.794
Keep your head down.

27:41.036 --> 27:43.866
It's not Brazilian.
Brazilians speak Portuguese.

27:43.914 --> 27:44.964
Where you going?

27:44.998 --> 27:46.248
I'm leaving.

27:46.291 --> 27:48.461
Stay here.
We can't be seen together, genius.

27:48.710 --> 27:51.880
-Fuck you. How long?
-I don't know. Ten minutes!

27:52.381 --> 27:53.381
Sit.

27:53.882 --> 27:56.222
Sit. No, that's standing. Come here.

27:56.552 --> 27:58.392
Go, go. Oh, man.

28:06.728 --> 28:07.728
How you doing?

28:07.980 --> 28:08.980
Good.

28:09.731 --> 28:12.401
Shit. Rocco, come on!

28:12.734 --> 28:14.074
Come. Good boy.

28:14.319 --> 28:15.899
You didn't read the book, did you?

28:16.154 --> 28:19.574
Some of it, yeah. No.

28:19.908 --> 28:21.078
Not a lot.

28:21.410 --> 28:24.080
I was thinking--now the holiday's over...

28:24.329 --> 28:26.829
...I lost a shift at the restaurant.

28:27.082 --> 28:28.422
I'm sorry.

28:28.750 --> 28:32.590
So maybe you could hire me, you know?

28:32.838 --> 28:37.588
Pay me to babysit rocco
when you're working?

28:38.260 --> 28:41.600
Hey, well, that's not such a bad idea.

28:41.930 --> 28:44.100
I work a lot at the bar.

28:44.349 --> 28:46.689
That would be very kind of you.

28:47.269 --> 28:48.939
You have a number I can call?

28:49.438 --> 28:53.268
Maybe call.
You want to arrange this properly?

28:54.693 --> 28:55.863
Just put it there.

28:56.111 --> 28:57.951
-Have you got a pen?
-No.

28:59.531 --> 29:00.871
I think I have a pen.

29:03.118 --> 29:05.948
Where's that pen when you need it?

29:09.625 --> 29:11.885
-Does it work?
-Yeah.

29:17.799 --> 29:18.799
Here you go.

29:19.134 --> 29:21.474
Great. That's a great idea.

29:21.803 --> 29:23.143
And I need a key.

29:23.388 --> 29:27.808
Well, like, maybe I could...
If you call me, I'll either have it...

29:28.143 --> 29:31.153
...and drop it around yours,
or I could leave it at the bar for you.

29:31.480 --> 29:32.480
Call me.

29:32.814 --> 29:36.154
Yeah, I'll call you...On this number
you gave me right now.

29:36.193 --> 29:37.863
Happy new year, by the way!

29:38.487 --> 29:40.317
Happy new year!

29:46.328 --> 29:48.328
We should join that show.

29:51.583 --> 29:53.503
You can't fucking sing.

29:54.169 --> 29:57.009
Not that one, the other one,
where the people...

29:57.256 --> 30:00.836
...go around the world
picking up clues and stuff.

30:01.176 --> 30:03.506
It'd be cool. Let's do it.

30:05.347 --> 30:06.677
We could see things.

30:06.932 --> 30:08.522
What things?

30:08.767 --> 30:10.847
I don't know. Other countries.

30:11.103 --> 30:12.693
Other ways.

30:14.273 --> 30:16.193
You see the old man today?

30:17.693 --> 30:19.193
Yeah, I was by.

30:22.364 --> 30:24.034
They want their money, Marv.

30:25.868 --> 30:27.038
Who?

30:27.536 --> 30:28.866
The home.

30:30.289 --> 30:31.459
They'll get it.

30:31.707 --> 30:34.207
It's the collection agency now,
not the home.

30:34.543 --> 30:38.213
Medicaid cutbacks. Me retiring.

30:39.298 --> 30:41.378
They're going to ship him out.

30:43.635 --> 30:44.965
To where?

30:45.220 --> 30:47.060
To a lesser place.

30:50.392 --> 30:52.062
Maybe it's time.

30:53.395 --> 30:54.555
Yeah.

30:58.901 --> 31:00.241
Just kill him.

31:01.236 --> 31:04.156
Our father. Because it's inconvenient.

31:04.907 --> 31:06.407
He's dead, Marv.

31:07.910 --> 31:10.580
So what are all those beeps
coming out of the machines...

31:10.829 --> 31:13.669
...he's hooked up to, and the waves
on the screen of the thing?

31:14.249 --> 31:15.579
That's life.

31:16.001 --> 31:18.091
That's electricity, is what that is.

31:26.428 --> 31:30.768
The other day, I picked up his hand
and put it on my cheek.

31:32.935 --> 31:34.775
And I could hear his blood.

31:38.607 --> 31:41.937
So you want to unplug him?
Go ahead, your decision.

31:42.277 --> 31:43.607
Take it easy.

31:43.862 --> 31:46.112
No, make the decision.
I'll be all right with it.

31:50.202 --> 31:51.872
That'd be a first.

31:53.789 --> 31:55.959
Never mind. It's okay.

31:56.625 --> 31:58.885
I'll get to Europe in another life.

32:01.255 --> 32:02.595
Rocco. Come to heel.

32:02.923 --> 32:05.433
Come to heel. Come to heel. And sit.

32:06.093 --> 32:08.093
-You see that?
-Yeah, I saw it.

32:08.428 --> 32:10.718
He almost gave me the paw.

32:10.764 --> 32:14.434
When I watch TV, he sleeps on my leg.

32:14.768 --> 32:16.268
-Really?
-Out.

32:16.603 --> 32:18.943
-Come.
-I'll be right back.

32:21.441 --> 32:23.441
Crazy. Come on.

32:36.415 --> 32:37.925
That's a nice dog.

32:39.126 --> 32:40.956
Thank you. I appreciate it.

32:41.962 --> 32:44.302
Yeah, that's a nice-looking dog.

32:53.473 --> 32:55.643
Don't forget to feed it.

33:09.489 --> 33:11.319
Tell me where the hospital is?

33:12.826 --> 33:15.326
Bang a u-ey, go down to the end here.

33:15.662 --> 33:18.162
Take a right. There'll be signs.

33:19.833 --> 33:21.133
Thanks.

33:39.353 --> 33:43.523
I promise, tomorrow we'll go to the park.
But I'm in a mad rush today.

33:44.191 --> 33:46.191
I will be back very soon.

34:08.340 --> 34:09.840
Hey, man, how you doing?

34:11.092 --> 34:13.683
Mind if I step in? It's kind of cold outside.

34:17.099 --> 34:18.768
Thanks a lot.

34:20.268 --> 34:21.599
Jesus.

34:29.777 --> 34:30.947
Can I help you?

34:31.196 --> 34:33.525
Yeah. Where are you keeping him?

34:34.032 --> 34:35.702
What are you talking about?

34:36.952 --> 34:40.462
The dog. You keep him in the kitchen?
The cellar?

34:42.623 --> 34:47.304
I remember you. You came up to me in the
park and told me I had a nice-looking dog.

34:47.795 --> 34:50.126
Yeah, well, he's not your dog.

34:51.132 --> 34:53.132
Yeah, he's my dog.

34:53.385 --> 34:55.385
Yeah? You register him?

34:55.637 --> 34:59.467
City says you have to license it.
How about a chip?

35:00.225 --> 35:01.975
-Excuse me?
-A security chip.

35:02.227 --> 35:06.227
Implanted in the dog. Pooch goes missing,
shows up at a vet. Vet scans the dog.

35:06.481 --> 35:08.821
Up pops a barcode with the owner's info.

35:09.067 --> 35:12.817
The owner, meanwhile,
walks around with a slip of paper.

35:13.655 --> 35:16.115
It has the security chip
account number on it.

35:16.158 --> 35:17.328
Check it out.

35:19.995 --> 35:21.665
You got my dog.

35:26.668 --> 35:28.498
No, it's my dog.

35:29.171 --> 35:30.591
You beat him.

35:31.507 --> 35:33.337
I'll tell the cops you did.

35:35.594 --> 35:37.014
What do you want?

35:40.933 --> 35:42.853
It's kind of sunny, right?

35:55.197 --> 35:56.867
But you never know, I guess.

36:34.736 --> 36:36.566
You never ask about it.

36:38.407 --> 36:42.737
You're the only person I ever met who
didn't ask about it in the first five minutes.

36:43.620 --> 36:44.950
It's your business, not mine.

36:45.747 --> 36:49.747
You'll tell me when you tell me,
or you won't.

36:51.086 --> 36:54.756
I did it to myself. I was pretty high.

36:55.340 --> 36:56.680
You did that?

36:58.594 --> 37:00.264
With one of those...

37:00.596 --> 37:01.926
...like, a peeler.

37:02.264 --> 37:03.264
Peeler?

37:03.765 --> 37:05.675
You know, a potato peeler?

37:05.934 --> 37:08.774
Oh, God, yeah, I know what that is, right.

37:11.940 --> 37:16.950
I was a different person then.
I didn't really like myself.

37:18.614 --> 37:20.454
Do you like yourself now?

37:22.451 --> 37:26.791
Sir, you cannot have a dog in here.
Dog goes, you guys go, okay?

37:39.051 --> 37:40.641
I'm telling you...

37:40.969 --> 37:43.299
-...I got guys following me.
-You don't.

37:43.555 --> 37:45.805
I do. I told you about the guy in the car.

37:46.058 --> 37:48.388
He was asking you for directions.

37:49.478 --> 37:52.978
It was the way he asked.
The way he was looking at me.

37:53.023 --> 37:54.483
I'm not a fucking idiot.

37:58.987 --> 38:01.317
What about you?
The guy with the umbrella.

38:01.907 --> 38:04.407
He's just interested in the dog.

38:04.743 --> 38:06.083
The dog.

38:06.662 --> 38:10.002
How do you know?
Maybe he's just telling you that.

38:15.838 --> 38:17.378
It's too much for them to...

38:17.422 --> 38:20.762
...put them back where they found them,
because that would require courtesy.

38:21.176 --> 38:23.506
You should just get a dumpster, Marv.

38:24.346 --> 38:27.346
"Just get a dumpster, Marv.
Get a dumpster."

38:27.683 --> 38:28.853
Sure.

38:29.518 --> 38:32.188
You remember I don't
own the bar anymore, right?

38:33.522 --> 38:34.692
Yeah.

38:35.274 --> 38:37.694
Yeah, but it's not your bar chovka took.

38:37.943 --> 38:39.283
That was 10 years ago.

38:39.528 --> 38:41.698
No, it was eight-and-a-half years ago.

38:42.531 --> 38:43.871
All right.

38:44.199 --> 38:46.199
Eight-and-a-half years.

39:01.383 --> 39:03.893
Dottie thinks we should visit Europe.

39:04.219 --> 39:07.809
That's what I've become--
a guy that goes to Europe with his sister.

39:08.390 --> 39:11.060
Hops in a, a tour bus...

39:11.560 --> 39:14.560
...with a fucking camera around my neck
like a fucking jerkoff.

39:20.736 --> 39:21.816
What?

39:25.908 --> 39:27.738
You need to see this, Marv.

39:28.577 --> 39:30.247
No, I don't.

39:31.246 --> 39:32.906
I don't need to do anything.

39:35.918 --> 39:40.588
I'm just going to stand right here.
I'm going to stand right the fuck here.

39:40.923 --> 39:42.093
No.

39:42.758 --> 39:45.088
You really should take a look at this.

39:45.427 --> 39:49.597
I don't need to see Europe.
I don't need to see dottie.

39:50.098 --> 39:52.268
And I don't need to see what's in that bag.

40:07.616 --> 40:09.946
What the fuck?

40:15.791 --> 40:17.791
We need to do something with it.

40:18.544 --> 40:19.964
What, the money or the...

40:20.337 --> 40:21.497
...thing?

40:21.547 --> 40:24.377
I bet what's in here adds up to
what we lost that night.

40:24.633 --> 40:26.303
Why'd they give it back to us?

40:26.635 --> 40:28.805
So we give it back to them.

40:29.471 --> 40:31.641
That's clearly what they expect.

40:52.828 --> 40:55.158
Like you're wrapping a piece of meat.

40:57.499 --> 40:59.749
Like you've done it a thousand times.

41:10.179 --> 41:12.509
Do you wonder if
you hadn't mentioned the watch...

41:12.764 --> 41:13.774
No, I don't.

41:14.016 --> 41:15.426
Well, I do.

41:17.019 --> 41:19.189
Hi, guys. You got any zima?

41:19.688 --> 41:21.518
No, we're closed.

41:21.857 --> 41:23.527
Well, your door was unlocked, so--

41:23.775 --> 41:26.435
I'm sorry about that,
but we're closed now, so...

41:27.529 --> 41:28.859
Yeah. Yeah.

41:29.114 --> 41:30.124
You got to go.

41:30.365 --> 41:31.615
Hey, Bob.

41:32.868 --> 41:34.538
How you doing? Nice to see you.

41:35.871 --> 41:37.211
All right, come on.

41:42.211 --> 41:44.051
Say hi to Nadia.

41:44.796 --> 41:48.216
Don't forget to stitch her up
when she stabs herself, okay?

41:56.892 --> 42:00.562
Tossing the missing piece of
the one-armed man around like a ham...

42:00.812 --> 42:02.652
...and the front door's open!

42:04.233 --> 42:06.903
-He didn't see anything.
-But he could've.

42:07.236 --> 42:08.566
But he didn't.

42:10.239 --> 42:11.739
You know that guy?

42:13.742 --> 42:15.992
Yeah. That's the guy
I told you about with rocco.

42:16.245 --> 42:18.085
Who claims the dog is his?

42:20.916 --> 42:22.576
You know who else he is?

42:22.626 --> 42:23.666
No.

42:23.710 --> 42:25.840
He's the guy who says
he killed Richie whelan.

42:33.095 --> 42:34.935
-That guy?
-Yeah.

42:35.931 --> 42:38.931
-That's Eric deeds?
-Yeah, that's Eric deeds.

42:40.352 --> 42:42.522
And he's fucked in the squash, that guy.

42:44.022 --> 42:45.772
Been in the joint a couple times.

42:45.816 --> 42:48.526
He did a 30-day in the cuckoo house,
if I recall.

42:49.278 --> 42:51.198
So you watch that fucking kid.

42:54.950 --> 42:56.950
Some fucking day, Marv.

42:57.619 --> 42:59.789
Yeah, some fucking day.

43:02.124 --> 43:05.464
Will you pass me the sports bag
by the wasp-and-ants spray?

43:05.794 --> 43:07.464
Yeah, sure, I'd love to.

43:08.714 --> 43:09.884
Thank you.

43:23.478 --> 43:25.478
I'm going for a walk now.

43:27.149 --> 43:28.319
Okay.

43:38.660 --> 43:40.330
Fucking Christ.

44:04.937 --> 44:06.767
Don't look at that. Don't look at it.

44:07.022 --> 44:08.862
Hey, hey, what's this?

44:09.107 --> 44:10.777
Go get it. Go on.

44:12.027 --> 44:15.697
Yeah, play with it. My big red bone.

44:16.365 --> 44:18.375
Go get it. Go get that!

44:18.700 --> 44:20.200
Get the bone!

44:43.225 --> 44:44.315
Shit.

44:44.810 --> 44:46.810
Mr. saginowski.

44:49.898 --> 44:52.728
-How you doing?
-I'm good.

44:56.905 --> 44:58.735
We haven't caught them yet.

44:58.991 --> 45:01.581
Yeah, well, you know, I assumed...

45:01.910 --> 45:03.750
That we didn't do our job?

45:04.580 --> 45:08.670
No, I just heard it was hard to
make an arrest on robbery cases.

45:10.752 --> 45:13.422
-What's up with the bag?
-This is...

45:13.755 --> 45:17.425
It's my poop bag and sometimes
I keep leashes and balls...

45:17.676 --> 45:19.256
...and stuff in my bag.

45:19.511 --> 45:20.851
Kind of empty.

45:21.763 --> 45:25.933
Yeah, well, I used my last poop bag
and I lost the ball.

45:28.437 --> 45:29.767
Richie whelan.

45:31.106 --> 45:32.936
-What about him?
-You know him?

45:33.192 --> 45:37.112
Sure. His friends were in the bar
the other day, toasting his anniversary.

45:37.613 --> 45:38.953
What anniversary?

45:39.198 --> 45:41.198
Of the last time anybody saw him.

45:41.450 --> 45:42.530
Which was at your bar.

45:42.784 --> 45:44.954
That's right. Yeah, he left.

45:45.287 --> 45:47.787
He took his car
and they found it someplace.

45:48.123 --> 45:50.133
Astoria. Torched.

45:50.751 --> 45:52.251
That's a good-looking dog.

45:52.294 --> 45:53.634
Thank you.

45:54.463 --> 45:56.303
You know an Eric deeds?

45:57.633 --> 46:00.973
Tall guy? Beard? He's, like, a brooder?

46:01.887 --> 46:03.047
Maybe.

46:03.305 --> 46:05.975
I mean, you working in that bar. Come on.

46:06.308 --> 46:09.138
You know people, Mr. saginowski.

46:09.978 --> 46:11.648
I got a picture.

46:19.571 --> 46:21.991
Nah. You think maybe he robbed the bar?

46:22.324 --> 46:23.324
No.

46:24.993 --> 46:27.373
I'm hearing here and there that this guy...

46:27.412 --> 46:30.002
...has something to do with
the whelan disappearance.

46:31.667 --> 46:32.997
Really?

46:35.170 --> 46:36.840
That's a really good-looking dog.

46:59.111 --> 47:01.361
I came by to give him his afternoon walk.

47:01.613 --> 47:02.613
Great.

47:02.865 --> 47:05.035
I freaked. Is your cell on?

47:05.367 --> 47:09.037
Yeah, but it's on vibrate. I couldn't feel it.

47:09.288 --> 47:10.708
I called a bunch of times.

47:10.956 --> 47:13.116
I know, I could see that. I'm sorry.

47:13.375 --> 47:16.875
-I thought you were working today.
-I am, it's just I had this...

47:17.212 --> 47:20.222
You know what? It's a really long story.

47:20.549 --> 47:23.389
I'm sorry. I should have called you.
I apologize.

47:23.719 --> 47:25.389
It's okay. Hey.

47:25.888 --> 47:28.058
So you know Eric deeds, huh?

47:30.392 --> 47:32.562
No. I don't "know him" know him...

47:32.895 --> 47:35.905
...you know? I know him from around.

47:36.732 --> 47:38.232
So you don't know him?

47:39.067 --> 47:40.567
Not really, no.

47:42.237 --> 47:45.237
That's funny, because
the way he said it, I figured...

47:45.824 --> 47:47.164
Figured what?

47:47.743 --> 47:49.913
I don't know. You know, maybe...

47:50.495 --> 47:52.905
-I don't know.
-Why are you on my ass about it?

47:53.999 --> 47:55.669
I was just asking a question.

47:55.918 --> 47:57.498
No, you were insinuating.

47:58.086 --> 47:59.496
No, I wasn't.

48:01.089 --> 48:03.759
Now you're arguing just to argue with me.

48:04.676 --> 48:05.676
No.

48:05.928 --> 48:06.928
-See?
-I'm not.

48:07.346 --> 48:09.506
I don't need this shit, okay?

48:10.933 --> 48:14.443
Wait. What happened here?
Did I say something wrong?

48:15.854 --> 48:17.944
You think you can push me around?

48:18.774 --> 48:20.364
No. Wait.

48:20.609 --> 48:22.609
Don't you fucking touch me.

48:45.968 --> 48:47.468
I don't understand.

48:51.139 --> 48:53.139
I asked her one question.

48:53.809 --> 48:57.809
A question. Simple.
And then it all came out sideways.

49:00.482 --> 49:02.652
You don't get it. They get in a mood...

49:02.901 --> 49:07.071
...you could give them the hope diamond
and they'd complain about the weight.

49:07.322 --> 49:08.492
Am I right?

49:08.740 --> 49:11.580
Bob, you ain't actually
talking about a girl, are you?

49:11.827 --> 49:13.497
Bobby's got himself a girl?

49:14.663 --> 49:17.003
Guy gets a dog, becomes a pussy magnet.

49:17.332 --> 49:19.502
They're flinging it at my man now.

49:23.422 --> 49:25.092
I'm gonna go play some pool.

49:31.346 --> 49:33.006
How are you?

49:34.850 --> 49:37.020
Chovka, let me get you a drink.

49:39.521 --> 49:43.191
Marv? Stella--Andre, he drinks Stella.

49:56.705 --> 49:58.035
There you go.

50:03.045 --> 50:04.385
Here it is.

50:06.715 --> 50:11.045
I put it in a ziploc.
But it's all there. You can count it.

50:12.387 --> 50:13.467
Ziploc?

50:13.722 --> 50:15.722
Well, it was a little wet.

50:16.058 --> 50:19.888
I was going to dry it,
but we don't have a dryer.

50:20.229 --> 50:23.149
So I figured I'd put it in a ziploc.
If you spread it out...

50:23.398 --> 50:26.738
...on a table,
it should be good come the morning.

50:27.819 --> 50:30.319
I have no idea
what you're talking about, Bob.

50:30.739 --> 50:32.489
This isn't what you gave me last time.

50:32.741 --> 50:35.081
That? No, that's not the bowmore 18.

50:35.410 --> 50:38.410
You didn't like it.
You said it smelled like feet.

50:38.747 --> 50:43.747
I figured that you would prefer this
a lot more. This is very special.

50:50.759 --> 50:52.089
It's Irish.

51:02.271 --> 51:03.361
We die.

51:04.273 --> 51:05.773
All of us...

51:06.191 --> 51:07.191
...Andre.

51:07.776 --> 51:11.446
But before you do, you have to
try this fucking whiskey, man.

51:11.864 --> 51:15.204
Yeah, get him one. Come on. Here.

51:20.706 --> 51:22.956
You handle the drop.

51:23.458 --> 51:25.788
All right. Which night?

51:26.461 --> 51:27.961
Super bowl.

51:34.970 --> 51:36.300
Okay.

51:41.643 --> 51:42.813
Is good.

51:54.990 --> 51:56.570
Detective evandro Torres.

51:57.409 --> 51:59.659
-Jimmy Sullivan.
-Thanks for seeing me.

51:59.912 --> 52:03.162
So you got nothing else about
the night glory days vanished?

52:03.415 --> 52:07.245
The only thing I remember
was that he left the bar to score weed.

52:07.503 --> 52:10.673
And the guys he got it from
were a couple of shitheads.

52:11.006 --> 52:15.676
A nutjob named deeds and
his junkie buddy-- what was his name?

52:15.928 --> 52:18.138
Tim Brennan.
He was in the original statement.

52:18.180 --> 52:19.350
That's the guy.

52:20.849 --> 52:23.689
He was going to see them both?
Or only one?

52:24.186 --> 52:25.846
I don't remember.

52:27.523 --> 52:31.863
But Bob saginowski and cousin Marv?

52:32.861 --> 52:35.031
-You trying to tie them to this?
-Nah, I just--

52:35.280 --> 52:38.780
you got me out here in front of the guys
I work with, looking like a snitch.

52:39.034 --> 52:41.544
Thanks for that. But cousin Marv's place?

52:41.870 --> 52:45.540
That's my bar. All right?
Don't fuck with my bar.

53:07.020 --> 53:08.520
You know, I'm...

53:09.940 --> 53:11.270
I'm sorry.

53:11.525 --> 53:13.535
I don't care if you know him.

53:13.777 --> 53:14.937
It's just that...

53:15.529 --> 53:19.779
...the way that he said hi, you know,
it sounded like it meant something.

53:20.701 --> 53:22.541
I was just asking.

53:25.372 --> 53:27.212
What else did he say?

53:28.041 --> 53:30.381
He said that rocco was his.

53:30.794 --> 53:34.384
That he has a chip in his neck to prove it.

54:02.409 --> 54:04.409
He used to be my boyfriend.

54:05.913 --> 54:08.583
In the beginning, he was charming.

54:09.249 --> 54:10.919
He was really nice.

54:11.585 --> 54:15.265
I know a lot of people said things
about him, but I don't judge people.

54:15.297 --> 54:16.587
I don't want to prejudge people.

54:17.758 --> 54:19.048
Sure.

54:19.426 --> 54:21.426
It just became too much.

54:21.762 --> 54:25.102
I haven't seen him in a while.
I thought he was gone.

54:45.118 --> 54:46.788
I'm sorry.

54:48.455 --> 54:50.115
I'm so sorry.

54:50.791 --> 54:53.461
-I'm sorry.
-You don't have to explain.

54:53.752 --> 54:55.752
Everybody has a past.

54:57.297 --> 55:00.967
And if this guy put rocco in your trash,
that's not your fault.

55:01.301 --> 55:05.141
And as for rocco, he won't blame you.
You know?

55:06.473 --> 55:08.313
He don't know no better.

55:24.449 --> 55:26.829
He's not just going to go away.

55:27.160 --> 55:29.330
Eric? No.

55:29.621 --> 55:32.671
He doesn't strike me as the type
that wants to do that.

55:33.000 --> 55:34.500
He's not.

55:38.005 --> 55:40.515
He killed a kid named glory days.

55:45.012 --> 55:47.182
Yeah. I heard that.

55:48.515 --> 55:50.175
I heard that.

55:51.310 --> 55:52.480
Richie whelan.

55:55.147 --> 55:56.307
Why?

55:56.690 --> 55:58.190
I don't know.

55:59.359 --> 56:03.029
He's not a big fan of "why". Eric.

56:07.534 --> 56:09.044
It's broken.

56:10.871 --> 56:12.211
Yeah, it is.

56:14.041 --> 56:15.921
Do you want me to fix it?

56:17.920 --> 56:20.090
-You want to fix it?
-Yeah.

56:21.089 --> 56:22.259
Sure.

56:23.175 --> 56:24.935
You want another beer?

56:25.260 --> 56:26.430
Yeah.

56:39.107 --> 56:43.447
So I heard that cousin Marv
doesn't own the bar?

56:43.779 --> 56:45.609
That some hard guys do.

56:45.864 --> 56:48.284
But you're not a hard guy.

56:48.951 --> 56:51.121
So why do you work there?

56:51.537 --> 56:54.207
You know me and cousin Marv
go way back, right?

56:54.456 --> 56:57.206
Yeah, Marv is actually my cousin.

56:57.459 --> 56:58.459
Yeah?

56:58.794 --> 57:01.304
Marv and his sister, dottie...

57:01.630 --> 57:05.470
...his father and my mother,
they're all sisters.

57:05.717 --> 57:06.797
Really?

57:07.302 --> 57:08.892
Did they share makeup?

57:09.137 --> 57:10.967
Why would they do that?

57:12.224 --> 57:14.774
You said they were sisters.

57:14.810 --> 57:18.150
You're right. Yeah. You know what I mean.

57:18.647 --> 57:21.147
Why are you jumping on me like that?

57:21.483 --> 57:23.323
-It's fun.
-Fun.

57:24.987 --> 57:26.147
Fun.

57:28.991 --> 57:31.991
Yeah, Marv thought he was a tough guy.

57:33.829 --> 57:35.499
We had a crew once.

57:35.747 --> 57:38.537
Back in the day, when we was young,
we made a little money...

57:38.584 --> 57:40.504
...but it was never, you know...

57:41.503 --> 57:44.513
So a mean crew rolls into town,
and, you know...

57:45.591 --> 57:48.091
...we flinched. That's it. End of the crew.

57:48.844 --> 57:50.514
But you're still in the life.

57:50.762 --> 57:52.512
Me? No.

57:53.182 --> 57:54.852
No. No, no, no.

57:55.184 --> 57:57.194
I just tend the bar.

58:13.535 --> 58:14.945
What are you doing? Get in.

58:15.204 --> 58:16.544
You fucking come out here.

58:16.788 --> 58:18.618
Are you nuts? It's freezing! Get in.

58:18.874 --> 58:20.884
I'm not getting in the car!

58:21.877 --> 58:23.547
You think the trunk's lined with plastic?

58:23.879 --> 58:25.209
How should I know?

58:25.464 --> 58:28.134
Here, go look then. Go ahead.

58:31.386 --> 58:34.716
Don't you fuck with me.
Don't you fucking dare!

58:35.224 --> 58:37.064
-Nobody's fucking with you.
-You hear?

58:38.227 --> 58:39.727
-All right?
-Yeah.

58:45.400 --> 58:48.070
Want to call your mommy
and tell her you're okay?

58:48.320 --> 58:52.490
Don't joke. Last time anybody saw
my brother alive, he got in a car with a guy.

58:52.741 --> 58:53.831
All right.

58:54.743 --> 58:56.913
You're right. I'm sorry.

58:58.997 --> 59:00.667
Take it easy.

59:03.752 --> 59:07.092
What we got here is
a risk-versus-reward kind of thing.

59:07.339 --> 59:11.589
We took the risk. And up to now,
it's not been working out so well, I know.

59:11.844 --> 59:13.184
Yeah, but?

59:14.763 --> 59:17.603
But I know where
the super bowl drop off will be.

59:18.016 --> 59:21.846
So if you want to hit them back for bri,
you hit them back for a million.

59:22.604 --> 59:24.274
It's suicide. Fucking suicide.

59:24.606 --> 59:25.936
I got news for you, fitzy.

59:25.983 --> 59:28.783
We're dead already,
we're just walking around.

59:29.111 --> 59:31.281
The only way to get out is to leave.

59:31.530 --> 59:33.530
I'm not doing another one, man.

59:34.032 --> 59:35.952
-You're not?
-I'm not.

59:36.952 --> 59:38.952
-You sure about that?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

59:40.205 --> 59:42.035
Okay, I'll square it with you then.

59:43.959 --> 59:45.789
I'm buying something with it.

59:46.962 --> 59:49.302
First, you don't tell anybody
what we just discussed.

59:49.631 --> 59:51.631
You don't tell anybody.

59:52.301 --> 59:56.301
Second, I need a place
to hole up for a couple days.

59:56.722 --> 59:58.472
What, you're on the street?

59:59.057 --> 01:00:01.057
-You didn't close the trunk.
-I closed it.

01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:02.730
Not very well.

01:00:06.315 --> 01:00:07.905
I closed that fucking thing.

01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:11.400
Forget about the trunk.
No, I'm not on the street.

01:00:11.737 --> 01:00:14.657
Everybody knows where I live.
Nobody knows where you live.

01:00:15.574 --> 01:00:19.664
So can I shack up with you tonight
or maybe tomorrow night?

01:00:19.912 --> 01:00:21.752
Not with me, but I know a place.

01:00:22.247 --> 01:00:23.327
All right?

01:00:24.082 --> 01:00:25.082
Got cable?

01:00:25.834 --> 01:00:28.174
-Motherfucker, what?
-You know, cable.

01:00:29.171 --> 01:00:30.511
Fuck you.

01:00:32.674 --> 01:00:35.684
You have to get behind it!
Slam it with two hands!

01:01:45.247 --> 01:01:46.577
Here you are.

01:01:54.089 --> 01:01:55.089
Good night.

01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:56.590
Good night.

01:01:58.927 --> 01:02:00.597
I got that.

01:02:03.765 --> 01:02:04.925
Bob?

01:02:07.102 --> 01:02:08.272
Thanks.

01:02:08.937 --> 01:02:10.267
For what?

01:02:12.441 --> 01:02:13.611
Good night.

01:02:37.132 --> 01:02:38.802
Sorry I was so long.

01:02:39.968 --> 01:02:42.468
I didn't take you with me.
You want a Chewie?

01:03:15.295 --> 01:03:16.335
Here.

01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:18.970
There you go. For you.

01:03:23.178 --> 01:03:25.638
-Mind if I sit down?
-No, have a seat.

01:03:34.857 --> 01:03:36.187
What's up?

01:03:38.527 --> 01:03:42.817
I was wondering
why you don't like my cousin.

01:03:42.865 --> 01:03:44.495
He took my dog.

01:03:45.242 --> 01:03:46.282
He didn't take your dog.

01:03:46.326 --> 01:03:48.496
You beat the crap out of it
and put it in a trash can.

01:03:49.705 --> 01:03:51.375
I felt bad about it.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.380
That count?

01:03:54.668 --> 01:03:55.668
Yeah.

01:03:56.044 --> 01:03:57.384
Okay, good.

01:03:58.046 --> 01:03:59.376
And now you want it back.

01:03:59.673 --> 01:04:02.723
What kind of question is that?
I don't know what I want.

01:04:03.218 --> 01:04:04.548
I don't know.

01:04:05.387 --> 01:04:09.017
But I don't want him walking around
thinking he's the shit.

01:04:09.558 --> 01:04:11.018
He needs to learn.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:12.890
Learn what?

01:04:13.187 --> 01:04:15.017
That he shouldn't have fucked with me.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.860
Are you fucking with me?

01:04:19.902 --> 01:04:21.572
Me? No, no.

01:04:22.362 --> 01:04:24.532
I'm too old for that shit. I come in peace.

01:04:25.073 --> 01:04:27.083
Why is that? Is there a war?

01:04:27.576 --> 01:04:29.236
Not that I know of.

01:04:30.037 --> 01:04:31.197
Good.

01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:34.540
In the bar the other night,
you made my cousin nervous.

01:04:35.709 --> 01:04:37.209
You don't see that often.

01:04:38.086 --> 01:04:41.256
I think there's a way
you and I can sort that out...

01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:43.590
...and both be happy.

01:04:57.606 --> 01:05:00.276
Look at you. You're looking good.

01:05:02.402 --> 01:05:04.112
Eric deeds' psych file.

01:05:04.154 --> 01:05:06.954
You got three minutes to read it.
There better be no grease on those fingers.

01:05:24.466 --> 01:05:25.966
Well, I'll be damned.

01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:28.140
Like you fucking weren't already?

01:05:30.973 --> 01:05:33.813
What? Not what you were expecting?

01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:36.640
My file?

01:05:37.312 --> 01:05:38.652
Yeah.

01:06:15.184 --> 01:06:17.194
You know what you're gonna do?

01:06:18.187 --> 01:06:19.847
You got to give me 10.

01:06:22.191 --> 01:06:24.861
Ten grand. By tomorrow morning.

01:06:25.861 --> 01:06:28.861
-Who's got $10,000?
-Come on.

01:06:29.865 --> 01:06:33.875
Listen. You want the dog,
you give me 10. Simple.

01:06:34.703 --> 01:06:38.873
Listen here, pal. You can't walk into
people's lives and expect them to--

01:06:39.166 --> 01:06:42.376
listen, listen. Take it easy. Listen to me.

01:06:42.669 --> 01:06:45.669
That is life. That's what it is.

01:06:45.714 --> 01:06:48.884
People like me coming along
when you're not looking.

01:06:49.218 --> 01:06:52.218
Just get my money, 10:00 A.M.,
your place, okay?

01:06:52.554 --> 01:06:56.224
And if you don't get it,
I'll go to the cops and get my dog back.

01:06:56.517 --> 01:06:59.847
Simple. And then I'll forget
to feed it for a while.

01:06:59.895 --> 01:07:02.525
And then when the dog
gets all yappy about it...

01:07:04.066 --> 01:07:07.066
...I'll beat his fucking head with a rock.

01:07:08.070 --> 01:07:09.900
All right? You picture that.

01:07:12.074 --> 01:07:13.414
Yeah.

01:07:15.244 --> 01:07:17.584
Remember what I did to Richie whelan.

01:07:18.247 --> 01:07:19.247
Yep.

01:07:20.082 --> 01:07:23.752
And I had a partner back then.
I still have him.

01:07:25.254 --> 01:07:26.424
You okay?

01:07:26.713 --> 01:07:28.723
Okay. It was good to see you.

01:07:44.606 --> 01:07:46.436
-Bobby, how's it going?
-Good. You?

01:07:46.733 --> 01:07:47.903
Good.

01:07:48.944 --> 01:07:52.614
What's happening?
I thought you took early retirement.

01:07:52.906 --> 01:07:55.236
What can you do?
I'll do another year or two.

01:07:55.284 --> 01:07:59.294
Hope the phlebitis don't get too bad.
See how I feel. Marv?

01:08:00.122 --> 01:08:01.792
I'm heading out to work.

01:08:02.124 --> 01:08:04.294
-Good day, dot.
-You, too!

01:08:04.626 --> 01:08:06.456
Are you going to eat something?

01:08:06.753 --> 01:08:08.093
Yeah.

01:08:08.130 --> 01:08:09.300
Okay.

01:08:16.638 --> 01:08:19.968
Biggest day in the world tomorrow,
I can't get you on the phone.

01:08:20.267 --> 01:08:23.437
Yeah. I forgot to tell you, I don't feel good...

01:08:23.478 --> 01:08:25.308
...so I'm not coming in.

01:08:25.981 --> 01:08:28.651
Call the bartemps.

01:08:28.984 --> 01:08:30.323
I did already.

01:08:30.819 --> 01:08:34.158
Super bowl. We always use them.

01:08:35.991 --> 01:08:38.661
-So what do you need me for?
-I don't.

01:08:40.996 --> 01:08:42.156
But...

01:08:44.832 --> 01:08:47.843
...you're blowing off
the biggest tip day of the year.

01:08:49.337 --> 01:08:51.167
What, I work for tips now?

01:08:51.506 --> 01:08:53.167
You ever go to the front of the bar...

01:08:53.466 --> 01:08:56.796
...and look at the sign on the bar?
Whose name is on it?

01:08:57.930 --> 01:08:59.600
That's my name.

01:09:00.599 --> 01:09:02.519
'Cause I used to own it once.

01:09:02.768 --> 01:09:05.518
Yeah, you been playing that flute
a long time now.

01:09:07.022 --> 01:09:10.192
And you've been awfully fresh since...

01:09:10.526 --> 01:09:13.526
...you got that dog
that you mistake for a kid.

01:09:14.529 --> 01:09:16.870
Marv, you can't redo it.

01:09:17.366 --> 01:09:20.536
All right? They pressed, you blinked.

01:09:20.868 --> 01:09:22.868
It's done. It's over.

01:09:23.872 --> 01:09:26.542
It's been over for a while now.

01:09:30.712 --> 01:09:35.221
Well, I'm not the guy who wasted
his entire life waiting for it to start.

01:09:35.884 --> 01:09:36.974
I did that?

01:09:37.886 --> 01:09:40.716
At least I had something once.

01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:44.390
I was respected. I was feared.

01:09:44.893 --> 01:09:49.903
When I walked into a place, people sat up.
They sat up straight. They noticed.

01:09:50.232 --> 01:09:51.902
What'd you ever have?

01:09:52.234 --> 01:09:55.244
And the fucking bar stool
you put that old biddy at.

01:09:55.571 --> 01:09:59.411
You don't think I don't know
that you did it on purpose?

01:09:59.741 --> 01:10:04.751
That was my stool and nobody sat on that
stool because it was cousin Marv's stool.

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:07.080
And that meant something.

01:10:07.583 --> 01:10:09.583
That meant something!

01:10:10.419 --> 01:10:11.749
But it didn't.

01:10:13.422 --> 01:10:14.762
Ever.

01:10:18.927 --> 01:10:20.757
It was just a stool.

01:10:27.102 --> 01:10:29.442
Are you doing something desperate?

01:10:31.023 --> 01:10:32.363
Again?

01:10:34.109 --> 01:10:35.109
Marv?

01:10:36.778 --> 01:10:41.448
Are you doing something
that maybe we can't clean up this time?

01:10:43.285 --> 01:10:44.955
I told you, I don't feel good.

01:10:45.954 --> 01:10:48.874
So why don't you get the fuck out of here?

01:10:50.292 --> 01:10:51.632
Really.

01:10:53.295 --> 01:10:54.635
Good-bye, Marv.

01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:00.300
I hope you feel better soon.

01:11:02.804 --> 01:11:04.814
Don't forget to eat something.

01:11:30.582 --> 01:11:32.252
The body of Christ.

01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:35.339
The body of Christ.

01:11:37.005 --> 01:11:38.665
The body of Christ.

01:11:40.342 --> 01:11:41.682
The body of Christ.

01:11:43.762 --> 01:11:45.432
The body of Christ.

01:12:05.367 --> 01:12:06.697
Should we go?

01:12:07.202 --> 01:12:08.702
Let's move out.

01:12:17.546 --> 01:12:20.216
Rocco, I'll have to lock you down in a sec.

01:12:20.549 --> 01:12:22.379
We have a long day.

01:13:04.927 --> 01:13:06.927
Hey, didi, how you doing?

01:13:07.262 --> 01:13:10.102
I got to...I got to talk to you.

01:13:10.349 --> 01:13:12.429
I want to take you someplace tonight.

01:13:13.101 --> 01:13:15.271
It's a lot of fun.

01:13:16.438 --> 01:13:17.768
Then we're out of here.

01:14:14.413 --> 01:14:16.253
Hi. How you doing?

01:14:17.082 --> 01:14:18.422
What do you want?

01:14:20.085 --> 01:14:21.915
I don't want you here. Please leave.

01:14:22.171 --> 01:14:24.841
No, listen to me.
Sit down and listen to me, okay?

01:14:25.507 --> 01:14:27.877
I want you to go. This is my home.

01:14:27.926 --> 01:14:31.676
I'm not your girl anymore.
I want you to leave.

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:37.600
Come on, take a seat. Come on.

01:14:37.853 --> 01:14:39.773
Don't play that shit. Sit down.

01:14:46.778 --> 01:14:47.858
You look good, by the way.

01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:52.120
We're going somewhere tonight.
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

01:14:52.451 --> 01:14:54.701
And after that, we're out of here.

01:14:55.787 --> 01:14:58.287
I want you to go. Please.

01:15:01.627 --> 01:15:03.287
You're going to go.

01:15:03.629 --> 01:15:06.299
And make yourself pretty, all right?

01:15:24.733 --> 01:15:26.073
Good to see you, man.

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:29.030
-Where you been?
-I came back to see you, Jimmy.

01:15:29.363 --> 01:15:31.873
He said, I'm coming right back for you.

01:15:52.219 --> 01:15:56.059
Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise and remove your hats...

01:15:56.098 --> 01:16:00.438
...as we honor America with
the singing of our national anthem.

01:16:00.727 --> 01:16:04.607
Two dos equis, three amstel, two shots
of Jack and a Dewar's on the rocks.

01:16:04.898 --> 01:16:07.068
-You hear that, rardy?
-Coming up.

01:17:11.298 --> 01:17:12.798
Hey, Bob?

01:17:13.675 --> 01:17:14.755
Bob?

01:17:14.801 --> 01:17:15.801
Bob!

01:17:16.303 --> 01:17:18.473
Can I get two more Heineken on 1-3?

01:17:18.805 --> 01:17:20.345
Rardy? Two more Heineken.

01:17:58.345 --> 01:18:00.175
-White wine, right?
-Yeah.

01:18:08.355 --> 01:18:12.355
Can you get me a stoli rocks
and a house chard for the lady?

01:18:15.362 --> 01:18:17.242
I didn't see you this morning.

01:18:17.531 --> 01:18:19.201
Yeah, so what?

01:18:20.534 --> 01:18:22.204
So you don't want the money?

01:18:23.370 --> 01:18:25.210
-You bring it?
-What?

01:18:25.247 --> 01:18:26.707
Did you bring the money?

01:18:28.083 --> 01:18:30.093
You strike me as
the type who would bring it.

01:18:30.377 --> 01:18:32.377
-Two Stella and an amstel.
-Sure.

01:18:32.421 --> 01:18:34.881
Rardy, two amstels and a Stella.

01:18:34.923 --> 01:18:36.423
Why is she here?

01:18:37.384 --> 01:18:38.894
She's my girl.

01:18:50.606 --> 01:18:53.726
Give me that piece of paper
and you get the money.

01:18:54.067 --> 01:18:55.067
What paper?

01:18:56.570 --> 01:19:00.070
The microchip and the license,
like we agreed.

01:19:00.115 --> 01:19:01.445
Why would I do that?

01:19:01.742 --> 01:19:06.042
Because that's why I'm paying you
the money. That's the deal.

01:19:06.371 --> 01:19:09.041
That's a deal. Hold on a second.

01:19:09.708 --> 01:19:12.538
You can keep the change. Keep the change.

01:19:12.794 --> 01:19:14.304
Two stellas and one amstel.

01:19:14.546 --> 01:19:16.376
What's up? Wait a minute.

01:19:17.466 --> 01:19:19.716
I can't talk right now. Wait a second.

01:19:20.052 --> 01:19:21.392
Here you go.

01:19:21.887 --> 01:19:23.557
What's that noise? Where are you?

01:19:23.805 --> 01:19:26.385
I'm at the place. Your place.

01:19:26.725 --> 01:19:28.055
The bar?

01:19:28.810 --> 01:19:30.810
Why the fuck you show up so early?

01:19:31.063 --> 01:19:34.653
This was simple. You show up at the
designated time, do the thing and leave.

01:19:36.068 --> 01:19:38.818
I know what he seems like,
but I shit you not, do not fuck with him.

01:19:39.071 --> 01:19:42.661
Stay away from him. He already thinks
you want to kill him over some fucking dog.

01:19:42.991 --> 01:19:44.331
Just stay in the back.

01:19:44.576 --> 01:19:45.906
Yeah, I got it.

01:19:46.161 --> 01:19:50.751
And you're in a bar. Don't drink too much.
I'll see you at 2:00, you fucking idiot.

01:19:56.755 --> 01:19:58.915
What an amazing game!

01:19:59.258 --> 01:20:02.258
Twenty-seven to 23, your final score!

01:20:22.281 --> 01:20:24.121
-Are you with him?
-No.

01:20:24.157 --> 01:20:25.487
So why are you here?

01:20:27.786 --> 01:20:30.286
-What were you talking about?
-I told you, nothing.

01:20:30.539 --> 01:20:31.539
Bob.

01:20:32.457 --> 01:20:33.877
Yeah, we do.

01:21:32.017 --> 01:21:35.847
This is not good. This is so not good.

01:21:37.523 --> 01:21:39.363
I don't want to be here.

01:21:39.691 --> 01:21:41.361
I didn't want to come here.

01:21:41.693 --> 01:21:45.033
He was waiting in my house
when I got home.

01:21:49.034 --> 01:21:51.044
I'm sorry, Bob.

01:21:56.124 --> 01:21:57.794
He has a gun.

01:22:09.888 --> 01:22:12.058
I'm going to the ladies'.

01:22:18.564 --> 01:22:20.574
What were you talking about?

01:22:20.607 --> 01:22:21.937
Football.

01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:26.910
Give me another shot, will you?

01:22:42.421 --> 01:22:43.961
What was the name of your partner?

01:22:44.423 --> 01:22:48.303
Wouldn't be much of a threat
if you knew who he was, would he, Bob?

01:22:48.594 --> 01:22:49.934
Yeah, but...

01:22:50.429 --> 01:22:53.099
...he helped you kill Richie whelan, right?

01:22:54.933 --> 01:22:56.313
That's the rumor, Bob.

01:22:56.602 --> 01:22:58.772
More than a rumor. It's what you said.

01:22:58.812 --> 01:23:02.322
Then it's more than a rumor, Bob.
What time is it?

01:23:03.275 --> 01:23:07.785
You know, you don't have to
keep calling me Bob all the time.

01:23:08.113 --> 01:23:10.163
I'll see what I can do, Bob. What is that?

01:23:10.449 --> 01:23:12.279
The 10 grand you wanted.

01:23:12.784 --> 01:23:14.294
This is 10 grand?

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:16.290
Yeah.

01:23:19.625 --> 01:23:21.135
You know what I think?

01:23:24.630 --> 01:23:26.670
I'm going to look in the safe at 2:00.

01:23:30.135 --> 01:23:33.965
Time lock goes off at 2:00 A.M.
you got 90 seconds to close it...

01:23:34.014 --> 01:23:36.474
...or it triggers two silent alarms.

01:23:37.017 --> 01:23:39.017
We should look in the safe at 2:00.

01:23:41.146 --> 01:23:42.646
Now you listen.

01:23:43.815 --> 01:23:47.315
I'm happy to pay you 10 grand for the dog.

01:23:48.487 --> 01:23:51.487
Yeah. Ten grand for the dog.

01:23:52.157 --> 01:23:53.487
But that's it.

01:23:55.661 --> 01:23:57.501
And how much for her?

01:23:57.829 --> 01:24:02.329
How about that?
How much should he pay for you?

01:24:02.668 --> 01:24:05.838
Eric, please. Please don't do this.

01:24:09.508 --> 01:24:11.338
-Where's Marv?
-Marv?

01:24:12.219 --> 01:24:14.049
You need him for something?

01:24:14.555 --> 01:24:15.895
I don't want anything.

01:24:16.181 --> 01:24:19.521
I just don't want him
creeping up my back all of a sudden.

01:24:20.352 --> 01:24:22.692
Yeah, my sweet cousin Marv.

01:24:24.022 --> 01:24:27.362
You know he's had some trouble,
Marv. Yeah.

01:24:27.693 --> 01:24:31.033
Like, about 10 years ago, man, he had...

01:24:31.363 --> 01:24:32.703
...a problem with the cards.

01:24:33.574 --> 01:24:35.204
I didn't know that, Bob.

01:24:35.242 --> 01:24:37.542
But he was more of a loan shark back then.

01:24:39.037 --> 01:24:40.707
And I remember this kid...

01:24:41.081 --> 01:24:43.711
...he was into him for a shitload of money.

01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:47.250
Hopeless case when it came to
the dogs and b-ball.

01:24:47.921 --> 01:24:52.221
Just degenerate, really. Kind of kid who'd
never be able to pay back what he owed.

01:24:52.259 --> 01:24:53.889
It's 1:57, all right?

01:24:53.927 --> 01:24:56.387
And then the kid goes to a.C. And he...

01:24:56.722 --> 01:25:01.392
...hits up a slot machine for 22 grand.

01:25:02.227 --> 01:25:03.397
Bam.

01:25:03.937 --> 01:25:08.267
Who'd have thunk it? It was, like,
a fraction more than what he owed Marv.

01:25:08.567 --> 01:25:10.737
So he didn't pay up
and you roughed him up.

01:25:10.777 --> 01:25:14.947
No, no. That's not what happened.
He paid back Marv, every cent.

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:16.910
He was a good guy.

01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:18.910
It's 1:58, all right?

01:25:18.952 --> 01:25:22.912
What he didn't account for
was Marv skimming off his own stash.

01:25:22.956 --> 01:25:25.626
Because of his habits
and his gambling debts.

01:25:25.918 --> 01:25:29.798
And this kid coming out of the blue
with 22 grand was a...

01:25:30.088 --> 01:25:31.418
...what'd he say?

01:25:32.424 --> 01:25:35.264
"A viable business opportunity."

01:25:36.261 --> 01:25:37.601
That's my cousin Marv.

01:25:38.430 --> 01:25:42.770
So long as nobody knew
that he'd paid Marv back off, you know?

01:25:43.602 --> 01:25:44.942
You see where this is going?

01:25:45.604 --> 01:25:47.274
Yeah, kid had to be ripped off.

01:25:47.314 --> 01:25:49.774
No. Kid had to be killed.

01:25:51.318 --> 01:25:53.818
So nobody'd know he'd paid Marv back off.

01:25:54.821 --> 01:25:56.491
So that's what we did.

01:25:57.282 --> 01:25:59.122
So you...

01:25:59.993 --> 01:26:01.663
-...killed him.
-Yeah, I did.

01:26:02.287 --> 01:26:03.997
I shot him in the face, twice.

01:26:05.123 --> 01:26:08.133
Then I wrapped his head in a towel
and stabbed him in the heart...

01:26:08.168 --> 01:26:11.628
...so he would bleed out, put him
in my bathtub and watched him drain.

01:26:12.464 --> 01:26:13.974
Then I put him in an oil tank...

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:17.470
...with laundry detergent and lye...

01:26:17.511 --> 01:26:18.851
...and sealed it back up.

01:26:23.308 --> 01:26:25.308
Want to know what his name was?

01:26:25.644 --> 01:26:27.484
It's 2:00, Bob. It's 2:00.

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:29.810
His name.

01:26:31.483 --> 01:26:34.493
-I would not know, Bob.
-Yes, you do. This is something you know.

01:26:34.528 --> 01:26:36.198
-I wouldn't know that, Bob.
-Guess.

01:26:37.155 --> 01:26:39.985
I know it's 2:00,
and you got to open the safe!

01:26:40.033 --> 01:26:41.033
Listen to me.

01:26:41.326 --> 01:26:42.656
His name...

01:26:43.161 --> 01:26:44.831
...was Richie whelan.

01:26:47.666 --> 01:26:49.536
Everybody called him glory days?

01:26:51.336 --> 01:26:53.376
I killed Richie whelan, okay?

01:26:53.964 --> 01:26:55.304
Sure you did.

01:27:25.537 --> 01:27:26.867
Fucking punk.

01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:32.790
Go out to dinner dressed like you're still
in your living room. You wear those...

01:27:33.045 --> 01:27:34.885
...big hippity-hoppity clown shoes.

01:27:35.130 --> 01:27:38.130
You speak to women terribly.
You treat them despicably.

01:27:38.383 --> 01:27:42.143
You hurt harmless dogs that can't defend
themselves. I'm tired of you, man.

01:27:42.387 --> 01:27:44.467
I'm tired of you. You embarrass me.

01:27:46.058 --> 01:27:48.558
You know,
he would have kept coming back.

01:27:48.810 --> 01:27:52.150
People like this, you let them
take something from you...

01:27:52.397 --> 01:27:55.067
...and they keep coming back.

01:27:55.317 --> 01:27:58.487
You still owe them
and they never, never change.

01:27:58.737 --> 01:28:00.737
You can never change their mind.

01:28:06.828 --> 01:28:08.158
You just...

01:28:09.248 --> 01:28:12.578
I mean, you just fucking shot him.

01:28:13.418 --> 01:28:17.418
Yes, I did. Absolutely.
He was going to hurt our dog.

01:28:34.857 --> 01:28:35.857
Bob?

01:28:36.108 --> 01:28:39.108
Can I...Can I go now?

01:28:40.445 --> 01:28:42.605
Yeah, of course. You can.

01:28:45.117 --> 01:28:47.617
So you...You'll let me go?

01:28:49.121 --> 01:28:50.791
Sure, sure.

01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:52.620
Why not?

01:28:53.292 --> 01:28:58.302
And, and nobody will ever
hurt you again. Okay?

01:28:58.797 --> 01:29:01.467
This is done. Okay?

01:29:02.801 --> 01:29:04.471
You got your stuff?

01:29:05.804 --> 01:29:07.144
Go on now.

01:29:11.143 --> 01:29:15.313
But now...Now you'll think I'll talk.

01:29:15.898 --> 01:29:17.228
I won't talk, Bob.

01:29:17.816 --> 01:29:19.226
I know you won't.

01:29:19.484 --> 01:29:21.654
I promise. I won't.

01:29:21.987 --> 01:29:25.817
Nadia, you can't. Not with these people.
They won't--

01:29:26.325 --> 01:29:28.165
your people, Bob.

01:29:28.744 --> 01:29:31.584
No, they're not my-- I'm not them.

01:29:32.497 --> 01:29:34.167
And I'm not this.

01:32:08.487 --> 01:32:10.817
You've seen better days, huh?

01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:18.200
Andre?

01:32:28.048 --> 01:32:29.378
He just came in.

01:32:29.675 --> 01:32:32.555
Yeah, that's right.
When I opened up the door.

01:32:32.886 --> 01:32:35.386
I was just letting Millie out, and...

01:32:35.722 --> 01:32:39.892
Put a gun in your face,
but you said, "not tonight," huh?

01:32:40.227 --> 01:32:41.897
I didn't say anything.

01:32:42.396 --> 01:32:44.186
You ever see him before?

01:32:44.231 --> 01:32:45.231
Yeah.

01:32:46.525 --> 01:32:48.195
Yeah, he was in here.

01:32:48.569 --> 01:32:51.239
Over there, watching the game.

01:32:52.239 --> 01:32:55.029
Caught my attention
'cause he was on his own.

01:32:56.910 --> 01:32:58.750
Maybe he wasn't.

01:32:59.246 --> 01:33:01.406
-No, he was, though.
-Or maybe he wasn't.

01:33:01.707 --> 01:33:02.957
I'm sorry, I don't follow you.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.380
Sure you do.
You say he was on his own, alone.

01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:08.420
I say he wasn't. What's to follow?

01:33:10.215 --> 01:33:11.215
You.

01:33:12.092 --> 01:33:13.552
You're alone.

01:33:14.761 --> 01:33:16.931
Sometimes it's good to be alone.

01:33:18.056 --> 01:33:19.386
Say it.

01:33:21.393 --> 01:33:22.733
Say it.

01:33:24.938 --> 01:33:26.438
I'm alone.

01:33:28.066 --> 01:33:30.936
No way, my man. You have friends.

01:33:31.945 --> 01:33:34.945
Speaking of friends, your cousin Marv?

01:33:35.282 --> 01:33:39.082
He told me he's retiring.
He want you to be the boss of the bar.

01:33:40.287 --> 01:33:42.457
I said, "of course, it's your bar."

01:33:43.457 --> 01:33:45.127
"But it's not your money."

01:33:45.459 --> 01:33:47.959
"So why you always trying
to take my money?"

01:33:48.295 --> 01:33:49.965
So I made him a deal.

01:33:50.297 --> 01:33:53.967
"You and your druggy friends
leave my money alone...

01:33:54.259 --> 01:33:58.469
...and I'll pay you a ticket
to a nice, quiet place."

01:34:02.309 --> 01:34:03.599
So what do you think?

01:34:04.978 --> 01:34:08.478
Take down his name, put up yours.
"Bob's bar."

01:34:09.316 --> 01:34:11.986
Has a nice ring to it, huh? "Bob's bar."

01:34:12.653 --> 01:34:15.033
"Bob's big bad bar."

01:34:15.364 --> 01:34:17.534
I'm kidding, my friend. Lighten up.

01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:19.870
Sure.

01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:29.380
-Did he fit?
-Yeah. Had to break his legs, but he fit fine.

01:34:29.711 --> 01:34:32.881
Smile. Don't mind,
everything's gonna be okay.

01:34:33.966 --> 01:34:35.626
Get some rest.

01:34:45.561 --> 01:34:46.731
Good night.

01:34:47.729 --> 01:34:48.899
Good night.

01:35:05.581 --> 01:35:09.581
There are some sins you commit
that you can't come back from...

01:35:09.835 --> 01:35:11.845
...no matter how hard you try.

01:35:12.087 --> 01:35:17.087
You just can't, you know? It's like
the devil is waiting for your body to quit.

01:35:19.094 --> 01:35:22.264
Because he knows...He knows that...

01:35:23.765 --> 01:35:25.925
...he already owns your soul.

01:35:26.185 --> 01:35:30.195
And then I think, maybe,
you know, there is no devil.

01:35:30.772 --> 01:35:33.942
You die, and God, he says:

01:35:34.776 --> 01:35:36.106
"Nah."

01:35:37.946 --> 01:35:39.946
"Nah, you can't come in."

01:35:40.282 --> 01:35:42.452
"You have to leave now."

01:35:43.118 --> 01:35:47.118
"You have to leave and go away
and you have to be alone."

01:35:49.374 --> 01:35:51.544
"You have to be alone forever."

01:36:25.994 --> 01:36:28.664
I'm sorry to hear about cousin Marv.

01:36:30.082 --> 01:36:32.922
It was a carjacking gone bad
is what they said.

01:36:33.168 --> 01:36:34.998
Carjacking? Right.

01:36:35.504 --> 01:36:38.344
That was an execution.

01:36:39.007 --> 01:36:40.217
A block and a half from this bar.

01:36:42.261 --> 01:36:45.011
Anyway, it fucking sucks
and I'm really sorry.

01:36:45.848 --> 01:36:47.178
Thank you.

01:36:48.767 --> 01:36:50.597
Are you going to
the church closing tomorrow?

01:36:50.853 --> 01:36:52.023
Yeah, of course.

01:36:52.271 --> 01:36:54.271
I don't know yet. I got a shift.

01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:59.280
They sold it. To milligan development.
What'd I tell you?

01:36:59.528 --> 01:37:01.858
Condos with stained glass windows.

01:37:06.702 --> 01:37:07.702
Eric deeds.

01:37:08.036 --> 01:37:09.866
I mentioned him to you once.

01:37:10.706 --> 01:37:11.786
Yeah, I remember.

01:37:12.291 --> 01:37:15.461
-You didn't then.
-I remember you mentioning him.

01:37:15.711 --> 01:37:19.051
He was in this bar super bowl Sunday.
You see him?

01:37:19.298 --> 01:37:23.468
No. There was a lot of people in here
on super bowl Sunday, so...

01:37:24.219 --> 01:37:25.549
Yeah, that's true.

01:37:26.138 --> 01:37:30.138
It's just this was the last place
he was ever seen and then...

01:37:30.559 --> 01:37:32.139
Just like Richie whelan.

01:37:33.729 --> 01:37:37.399
Ironic, 'cause deeds
supposedly killed whelan.

01:37:37.733 --> 01:37:42.073
Bodies getting clipped or vanishing
all over the place, but...

01:37:42.571 --> 01:37:45.241
...come on, man, you don't see anything?

01:37:45.741 --> 01:37:49.241
Nah. You know,
that's this neighborhood, right?

01:37:50.412 --> 01:37:52.082
But he could turn up.

01:37:52.831 --> 01:37:54.501
People do all the time.

01:37:54.750 --> 01:37:58.250
That's true. If he does,
it'll probably be in a psych ward.

01:37:59.254 --> 01:38:02.344
Which is where he was
the night whelan disappeared.

01:38:03.592 --> 01:38:06.262
I'm not lying. It's true.

01:38:06.678 --> 01:38:10.848
Deeds always took credit for the whelan hit
'cause nobody else wanted to.

01:38:11.099 --> 01:38:13.349
He thought it would help his street cred...

01:38:13.602 --> 01:38:15.602
...but he didn't kill whelan.

01:38:15.938 --> 01:38:17.268
He didn't?

01:38:26.114 --> 01:38:27.284
Yeah.

01:38:35.791 --> 01:38:39.631
No one ever sees you coming,
do they, Bob?

01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:27.680
Rocco. Something we got to do.

01:39:54.369 --> 01:39:57.709
When you left the bar,
I know that meant stay away.

01:39:58.373 --> 01:40:02.383
I know that meant stay away,
but you didn't say it.

01:40:05.714 --> 01:40:08.724
So if you say it, then...

01:40:09.051 --> 01:40:13.051
...I will just go. Believe me, Nadia,
I will leave right now.

01:40:14.223 --> 01:40:15.893
But you have to say it.

01:40:31.907 --> 01:40:33.407
Let me go get my jacket.

01:40:34.243 --> 01:40:35.413
Yeah?

01:40:36.578 --> 01:40:38.578
Sure, great. Great.
