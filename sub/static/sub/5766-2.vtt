WEBVTT

00:02.800 --> 00:05.121
(gavel pounding)

00:08.400 --> 00:10.630
In the matter of
The People of Illinois

00:10.670 --> 00:13.798
v. Randall A. Simmons,

00:13.840 --> 00:18.800
case number 10-C-R-2085,

00:18.850 --> 00:23.549
on the charge
of first degree murder,

00:23.590 --> 00:26.058
we find the defendant

00:26.090 --> 00:27.580
not guilty.

00:27.620 --> 00:31.124
(Simmons gasps)

00:31.160 --> 00:32.320
It's over. It's over.

00:32.360 --> 00:33.520
You hear me?

00:33.560 --> 00:35.323
All right?
WOMAN: Murderer!

00:35.360 --> 00:36.793
You killed my daughter!
(gavel pounding)

00:36.830 --> 00:39.094
You!You!
Order!

00:39.140 --> 00:40.835
Order in this court!
(yelling)

00:40.870 --> 00:42.167
Dad.
Son.
Murderer!

00:42.210 --> 00:43.837
JUDGE:
Bailiff,
restrain that woman.

00:43.870 --> 00:46.430
Murderer!
(gavel pounding)

00:46.480 --> 00:48.107
MOTHER:
You!You!

00:48.140 --> 00:49.801
JUDGE:
I'm warning you.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.602
I can clear this court
if order's not restored.

00:51.650 --> 00:53.208
(mother yelling)

00:54.450 --> 00:56.179
Hey!

00:56.220 --> 00:58.848
I want you to have that.

00:58.890 --> 01:01.188
They were willing
to take it.

01:01.220 --> 01:02.687
Eight years,
second degree murder.

01:02.730 --> 01:06.257
We agreed it was the right move.
(paper rustling)

01:06.300 --> 01:08.120
Tell that to her.

01:08.160 --> 01:11.220
(mother sobbing)

01:14.870 --> 01:16.633
That was a tough one.

01:16.670 --> 01:18.137
Thought you had it.

01:18.170 --> 01:19.205
You had the jury.

01:19.240 --> 01:20.537
You had the judge.

01:23.210 --> 01:26.145
He killed her, you know?

01:30.320 --> 01:32.709
We don't know anything.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.309
WILL:
It's not about trial.

01:35.360 --> 01:36.622
It's about pretrial.

01:36.660 --> 01:38.127
It‘s about
excluding eVIdence.

01:38.160 --> 01:40.151
_ Even a case
like Randall Simmons?

01:40.200 --> 01:41.827
Especially a case
like Randall Simmons.

01:41.860 --> 01:43.293
We didn't win that in court.

01:43.330 --> 01:44.627
I know it's not sexy,

01:44.670 --> 01:47.230
but we won that in
pretrial motions.

01:47.270 --> 01:48.396
No, it's sexy.

01:48.440 --> 01:50.704
What's this for again?

01:53.210 --> 01:54.575
My last question,
Mr. Gardner,

01:54.610 --> 01:55.838
if you don't mind.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.201
Sure. Shoot.

01:58.250 --> 01:59.319
You don't really
prefer boxers

01:59.350 --> 02:01.818
over briefs, do you?

02:01.850 --> 02:03.738
What?

02:03.790 --> 02:05.417
This is about the...?

02:07.960 --> 02:11.157
You don't really want to know
about my legal strategy, do you?

02:11.190 --> 02:12.896
I do.

02:12.930 --> 02:14.750
But first,
are you proud of being

02:14.800 --> 02:17.394
the city's 16th
most eligible bachelor?

02:17.430 --> 02:21.230
Well, I was lobbying for 12th,
but it's all very political.

02:21.270 --> 02:23.261
Joe.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.164
I sure didn't expect
to see you here.

02:25.210 --> 02:26.438
JOE: Just like a Republican:
counting your elective chickens

02:26.480 --> 02:27.799
before they hatch.
DOBBS: Joe,

02:27.840 --> 02:29.239
I'm an independent conservative,
remember?

02:29.280 --> 02:30.645
But let's give
these Republicans some credit.

02:30.680 --> 02:32.841
Oh, Joe, there you are.
Sorry, I was on a call.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.575
Look who I found
haunting your halls.

02:34.620 --> 02:36.212
Oh, hello.

02:36.250 --> 02:37.319
DOBBS:
Hello.

02:37.350 --> 02:38.510
Are you...?

02:38.550 --> 02:39.949
Looking for Derrick Bond.

02:39.990 --> 02:40.957
Lou.

02:40.990 --> 02:42.958
Derrick. Good to see you.
And you.

02:42.990 --> 02:45.424
I liked your D.C. offices.

02:45.460 --> 02:47.826
Yes. Yes, I think I like these
a little bit more.

02:47.860 --> 02:50.294
More, um, traditional.

02:50.330 --> 02:52.537
Oh, Mr. Trippi,
nice to meet you.
Good to meet you.

02:52.570 --> 02:54.435
This is Mr. Bond.

02:54.470 --> 02:55.767
Bond & Associates.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.336
We, uh, merged.

02:58.510 --> 03:00.603
You're really
representing Lou Dobbs?

03:00.640 --> 03:02.676
I, um...

03:02.710 --> 03:04.507
am as surprised as you.

03:04.550 --> 03:06.347
Talk about strange bedfellows.

03:09.550 --> 03:11.245
Uh, so I'm going to start
streaming this live now,

03:11.290 --> 03:12.314
if that's okay,
Mr. Florrick.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.749
It is, Freddy.
Go right ahead.

03:14.790 --> 03:16.382
Thank you for doing
this, Mr. Florrick,

03:16.430 --> 03:18.625
and, uh, congratulations
on your traction

03:18.660 --> 03:21.424
against Glenn Childs--
it must feel good.

03:21.460 --> 03:23.860
Well, I love
this city, Freddy.

03:23.900 --> 03:26.869
So what's your take on
the state's attorney loss

03:26.900 --> 03:29.437
yesterday against the wife
killer Randall Simmons?

03:29.470 --> 03:31.529
A tragedy. That was winnable.

03:31.570 --> 03:33.800
Think Simmons should have
gotten a stiff sentence--

03:33.840 --> 03:35.273
the stiffer the better?

03:35.310 --> 03:36.641
Absolutely.

03:36.680 --> 03:38.307
If the punishment
fits the crime,

03:38.350 --> 03:39.476
the stiffer the better.

03:39.520 --> 03:42.284
But, um, your wife was
on the defense team.

03:42.320 --> 03:44.379
Now isn't that
a dichotomy--

03:44.420 --> 03:46.957
your wife fighting to
get a wife killer

03:46.990 --> 03:48.617
out on the streets.
No, not at all.

03:48.660 --> 03:50.389
As a matter of fact,
I'm very proud of my wife.

03:50.430 --> 03:52.990
The job of a state's attorney
is not to wish

03:53.030 --> 03:56.363
that the defense goes easier
on you, it's to fight harder.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.992
Fair enough.

03:58.030 --> 04:00.362
Now do you expect to have
any sort of open debate...

04:00.400 --> 04:01.890
(phones ringing,
indistinct conversations)

04:01.940 --> 04:03.498
Mr. Gold...
Five minutes then pull him.

04:03.540 --> 04:05.838
We have another dozen
of these to do.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.303
Well, we caught something
on College Humor.

04:07.340 --> 04:08.637
You should take a look.

04:08.680 --> 04:09.908
BECCA:
I completely agree

04:09.950 --> 04:11.747
and so does
Peter Florrick.

04:11.780 --> 04:13.975
He'll be happy to
have people like you
helping his campaign.

04:14.020 --> 04:16.648
(Becca laughs)

04:16.690 --> 04:18.419
Well, that's very
nice, ma'am.

04:18.450 --> 04:20.384
You should really come hear
Mr. Florrick speak.

04:20.420 --> 04:22.285
Well, hello there.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.580
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Twohy.

04:25.630 --> 04:29.396
Yes, I'm looking
forward to it.

04:30.800 --> 04:31.824
Mr. Gold, hello.

04:31.870 --> 04:33.394
Becca.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.566
You're looking healthy.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.409
I am healthy.

04:36.440 --> 04:37.429
You cut your hair.

04:37.470 --> 04:39.028
Yes, it was getting long.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.879
So you're a volunteer.

04:40.910 --> 04:42.946
I am. I'm just giving back.

04:42.980 --> 04:44.379
Inspiring.

04:44.410 --> 04:46.617
Youth today putting
aside their video games.

04:46.650 --> 04:48.845
Oh, the Obama generation.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.586
(picks up phone receiver)
(chuckles)

04:50.620 --> 04:52.349
(sets down phone receiver)
No.

04:52.390 --> 04:55.848
Why, Mr. Gold, you...
you don't trust me?

04:55.890 --> 04:57.357
Oddly enough, no.

04:57.390 --> 04:59.858
Hmm. I haven't tweeted.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.698
You asked me not to,
and I didn't tweet.

05:02.730 --> 05:05.062
I threatened you not to
tweet and you did tweet,

05:05.100 --> 05:07.660
about whether Mr. Michaels,
your history teacher, was gay.

05:07.700 --> 05:09.839
Zach said you needed volunteers.

05:09.870 --> 05:11.406
That's why I'm here.

05:11.440 --> 05:12.338
Zach told you?

05:12.380 --> 05:14.632
Yes, your boss's son.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.648
I'm sorry, we're all full up.

05:17.680 --> 05:19.614
But thank you,

05:19.650 --> 05:21.447
dear Becca.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.948
Excuse me, Mr. Gold...
Thank her and
get rid of her.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.458
College Humor--
it just went up an hour ago.

05:26.490 --> 05:29.425
It's the call girl, Amber.

05:29.460 --> 05:31.121
* On the bed,
in the car out of state *

05:31.160 --> 05:33.128
* Peter Florrick *

05:33.160 --> 05:36.049
* He's the best candidate
* Peter Florrick *

05:36.100 --> 05:38.967
* No one makes me self stimulate
like Peter Florrick *

05:39.000 --> 05:41.969
Oh, dear God.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.366
People say your down
in the polls,

05:44.410 --> 05:47.629
but I say you're always good
at coming from behind.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.477
* Coming from behind *
Oh, dear God.

05:49.510 --> 05:52.149
You're not afraid to hand out
stiff sentences,

05:52.180 --> 05:55.377
and I think you agree,
the stiffer the better.

05:55.420 --> 05:57.445
* Stiffer is better 1‘
And let's not even get into...

06:00.420 --> 06:01.819
Get the key!

06:01.860 --> 06:03.555
Is the other door unlocked?

06:03.590 --> 06:05.649
No. Mr. Gold, he's going
to open it after the interview.

06:05.690 --> 06:08.352
No... It's a setup!

06:10.430 --> 06:11.397
Get him off the interview!

06:11.430 --> 06:13.739
Cut it! Shut down the computer!

06:13.770 --> 06:15.499
They're setting up his words!

06:15.540 --> 06:17.167
It's a setup.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.507
Stop it now.

06:21.180 --> 06:22.647
Okay, Freddy, thank you.

06:24.980 --> 06:26.948
What are you doing?
What is it?

06:26.980 --> 06:30.882
We just gave them
tomorrow's news cycle.

06:34.090 --> 06:35.614
Where you at?

06:35.660 --> 06:38.720
Oh! Yes!

06:38.760 --> 06:40.193
Done!

06:40.230 --> 06:41.857
Just like old times.

06:41.900 --> 06:43.993
Who wins? Me.

06:45.230 --> 06:46.868
Well?

06:46.900 --> 06:50.199
I still don't like it
as much as racquetball.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.707
Why the call, Cary?

06:51.740 --> 06:53.833
Why?

06:53.880 --> 06:55.529
The old peace corps gang

06:55.580 --> 06:56.899
kept wanted to know
what happened to you.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.770
Really?
(chuckles)

07:00.520 --> 07:02.169
What is that, your novel?

07:02.220 --> 07:04.586
It's a murder case.
Randall Simmons.

07:04.620 --> 07:06.087
Thought his wife
was cheating on him,

07:06.120 --> 07:08.509
stabbed her 38 times
with a bowie knife.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.089
Thought you'd
take a look at it.

07:11.130 --> 07:12.495
Why?

07:12.530 --> 07:14.589
I lost.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.226
Take off your shoe.

07:19.270 --> 07:22.899
Why?
Because I want you
to take off your shoe.

07:22.940 --> 07:24.703
It's on my foot.
So untie it.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.136
Aw!

07:29.180 --> 07:31.068
Yeah, just take
a look at it.

07:31.110 --> 07:32.816
They were willing
to take eight years.

07:32.850 --> 07:34.078
So you screwed up.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.576
We thought
we could get life.

07:35.620 --> 07:37.087
You don't even have
to go to trial.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.587
You get a fast eight years.

07:38.620 --> 07:40.156
We've done all
the heaw lifting.

07:40.190 --> 07:42.488
Clearly you haven't or the guy
would be in prison.

07:42.530 --> 07:45.488
We couldn't get
the evidence in-- you can.

07:45.530 --> 07:47.657
Just take a look at it.

07:59.010 --> 08:00.602
More questions?

08:00.640 --> 08:02.005
Follow-ups.

08:03.580 --> 08:04.945
No.

08:04.980 --> 08:07.710
Just need to fact check.

08:08.720 --> 08:09.846
(phone ringing)

08:09.890 --> 08:11.141
You don't need to answer that.

08:12.220 --> 08:15.678
You're right, I don't.

08:15.720 --> 08:17.529
Hello.

08:18.960 --> 08:21.724
(indistinct radio transmission)

08:21.760 --> 08:24.194
What happened?
What's the charge?

08:24.230 --> 08:25.527
Murder.
Whose?

08:25.570 --> 08:27.037
His wife's.
No, they can't.

08:27.070 --> 08:28.196
Double jeopardy-- he's
been tried, cleared.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.639
SIMMONS:
Three days, Mr. Gardner,

08:29.670 --> 08:31.809
that's all.
Three days free.

08:31.840 --> 08:33.273
It's okay, Randall,
I can handle this.

08:33.310 --> 08:35.073
Mr. Gardner,
Captain Melinda Gossett.

08:35.110 --> 08:36.702
US. Army Judge Advocate
General's Corps.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.139
JAG. What, are you kidding me?

08:39.180 --> 08:41.171
At the time of the murder,
your client was a
mobilized reservist

08:41.220 --> 08:44.041
on Title 10 orders.

08:44.090 --> 08:45.239
As such, it isn't
double jeopardy.

08:47.190 --> 08:50.284
The crime falls concurrently
under military jurisdiction.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.286
Specialist Randall Simmons,

08:52.330 --> 08:54.059
pursuant to article 118
of the Uniform Code,

08:54.100 --> 08:55.192
you're hereby apprehended

08:55.230 --> 08:57.164
to face charges
for murder.

09:03.310 --> 09:07.269
Captioning sponsored by
CBS

09:16.350 --> 09:19.046
You're not afraid to hand out
stiff sentences,

09:19.090 --> 09:20.352
and I think you agree,

09:20.390 --> 09:21.914
the stiffer the better
The stiffer the better.

09:21.960 --> 09:22.858
* Stiffer is better *

09:22.890 --> 09:25.222
It's got to be her.
She's out to get me.

09:25.260 --> 09:26.284
It doesn't matter.

09:26.330 --> 09:27.297
Childs is benefiting.

09:27.330 --> 09:28.354
He's probably financing it.

09:28.400 --> 09:31.221
* Just you and me
by candlelight *

09:31.270 --> 09:34.865
* You can caucus me all night

09:34.900 --> 09:36.709
Absolutely.
* All night...

09:36.740 --> 09:38.731
Has it gone viral?

09:38.770 --> 09:40.032
It's growing.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.775
If she showed more skin,
it would grow faster.

09:41.810 --> 09:44.074
Well, we're just going
to have to take the high road.

09:44.110 --> 09:47.841
And you're going to have to vet
those reporters more closely.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.370
Yeah, my fault.

09:49.420 --> 09:51.786
There is something else
we can do.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.186
Pull the trigger.

09:54.220 --> 09:55.187
If we go negative first,

09:55.220 --> 09:57.381
we're going to be seen
as going negative first.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.488
Peter, he will kill you

09:58.530 --> 10:00.259
with a million viral paper cuts
just like this one.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.256
Let him kill me because
I'm not gomg to give him

10:02.300 --> 10:03.790
an excuse to come after
my family.

10:03.830 --> 10:05.366
ELI: What do you think
he's doing?

10:05.400 --> 10:07.231
These people are just looking
for anything they can use

10:07.270 --> 10:08.794
to make you look bad.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.398
Peter, they have trackers
out there everywhere.

10:10.440 --> 10:11.634
They could
follow you around.

10:11.670 --> 10:13.877
They could follow
your family.

10:13.910 --> 10:16.640
They could take anything you say
out of context.
What's wrong?

10:17.850 --> 10:20.375
Nothing.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.274
Something is.

10:22.320 --> 10:24.345
What did you do?

10:28.290 --> 10:30.155
It was at Grandma's
meeting thing.

10:30.190 --> 10:31.384
ZACH:
What was?

10:31.430 --> 10:32.795
This kid

10:32.830 --> 10:34.388
with a cell phone camera.

10:34.430 --> 10:35.727
There were two kids.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.398
They were asking me questions.

10:37.430 --> 10:38.761
Like what?

10:38.800 --> 10:40.165
About Dad.

10:40.200 --> 10:42.339
And her, the hooker.

10:42.370 --> 10:45.237
They taped it, but I haven't
seen it anywhere.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.170
What did you say?
Nothing.

10:47.210 --> 10:48.734
I was defending Dad.

10:48.780 --> 10:50.270
They just kept on asking.

10:50.310 --> 10:52.403
Should we tell Dad?

10:52.450 --> 10:54.748
Maybe they're not
going to use it.

10:54.780 --> 10:57.044
Or they're saving it.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.735
Eight years.

11:16.770 --> 11:18.704
Come on, you're
shaking us down.

11:18.740 --> 11:20.105
Because of the moratorium,

11:20.140 --> 11:21.903
Illinois currently
has no death penalty,

11:21.940 --> 11:24.443
but the military does, and
we're not afraid to use it.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.879
If I were you, I'd
take the eight years.

11:25.910 --> 11:27.446
We'll get back to you.

11:31.350 --> 11:32.954
Um, we'll-we'll get back to you.

11:32.990 --> 11:35.709
I'm Lieutenant Terrence Hicks,

11:35.760 --> 11:37.489
Mr. Simmons'
court-appomted lawyer.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.727
The thing I'd like
to point out is that,

11:40.760 --> 11:44.093
given the evidence,
eight years is reasonable.

11:44.130 --> 11:45.825
I think you should consider it.

11:45.870 --> 11:46.837
Lieutenant,

11:46.870 --> 11:50.362
a year ago, I came home
to find my wife stabbed.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.059
The wife I love.

11:52.110 --> 11:53.372
I spent the last year trying

11:53.410 --> 11:55.401
to convince people
that I didn't do it.

11:55.440 --> 11:56.771
And when I finally did,

11:56.810 --> 11:59.244
when I finally slept at home
again, I...

11:59.280 --> 12:02.113
I will not take a plea
of eight years.

12:02.150 --> 12:03.378
I did not do this.

12:03.420 --> 12:04.444
I will not.

12:07.390 --> 12:09.824
You're free to retain _outside
counsel if you Wish.

12:09.860 --> 12:11.384
I'll simply remain as standby.

12:11.430 --> 12:14.319
Please, help me.
You got me off before.

12:14.360 --> 12:15.327
The thing is, Randall,

12:15.360 --> 12:16.964
we don't usually practice
in military court.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.729
I don't care.
I trust you.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.800
I thought we were closing down
the Simmons defense.

12:23.840 --> 12:24.966
We were.

12:25.010 --> 12:26.466
Things changed.
(sighs) We're not gonna

12:26.510 --> 12:28.978
make the same mistake
as last year, are we?

12:29.010 --> 12:30.307
What was the mistake
last year?

12:30.350 --> 12:33.148
Taking cases on whim,
not long-term strategy.

12:33.180 --> 12:34.317
Not whim, passion.

12:34.350 --> 12:35.442
And Simmons brings us attention.

12:35.480 --> 12:39.541
Yeah, more broke clients.

12:39.590 --> 12:43.526
But, look, I'll support you
if you support me.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.187
Derrick represents Lou Dobbs.

12:45.230 --> 12:46.458
Oh, yeah, I saw that yesterday.

12:46.490 --> 12:48.151
How did that go down
with Trippi?

12:48.200 --> 12:51.328
Their publishers have projects
in conflict.

12:51.370 --> 12:53.895
We're going to have to drop one.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.158
So can I count on you?

12:56.200 --> 12:58.839
For a vote? Sure.

12:58.870 --> 13:01.100
That's why we did this;
two partner to one.

13:01.140 --> 13:03.279
So send Lou Dobbs packing.

13:03.310 --> 13:05.198
Go follow your bliss.

13:06.450 --> 13:09.248
You know,
I should wear a uniform.

13:09.280 --> 13:10.588
I think I'd look good in one.

13:10.620 --> 13:12.485
With tassels on the shoulder...

13:12.520 --> 13:15.182
like HMS Pinafore.

13:20.160 --> 13:21.593
Hello.

13:21.630 --> 13:22.426
You okay?

13:22.460 --> 13:25.099
I'm great.

13:25.130 --> 13:26.529
Mr. Bond thought that

13:26.570 --> 13:28.265
I should help you out
with Simmons.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.860
Ah, that's okay.
Kalinda can help me.

13:30.910 --> 13:33.606
She's a little busy;
Murphy/Gomes.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.198
Oh. Well, are
you familiar

13:35.240 --> 13:36.468
with the Randall
Simmons murder?

13:36.510 --> 13:38.102
Iam.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.845
We're headed straight
into court, so...

13:39.880 --> 13:40.972
You'll need the CID file.

13:41.020 --> 13:42.544
Yes.

13:42.580 --> 13:43.581
I took the liberty.

13:43.620 --> 13:45.315
You took the liberty.

13:45.350 --> 13:46.988
How did you even know
to take the liberty?

13:47.020 --> 13:48.556
I keep track of things.

13:48.590 --> 13:50.524
Okay.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.152
Can I draw your attention
to one thing?

13:52.190 --> 13:54.556
Draw away.

13:57.270 --> 14:00.398
The Army canvassed the crime
scene at the time of the murder,

14:00.440 --> 14:01.338
but they backed off

14:01.370 --> 14:03.600
when the state's attorney
brought charges.

14:03.640 --> 14:06.871
Now this is the investigation
from a year ago.

14:06.910 --> 14:10.368
But these notes
in the margins,

14:10.410 --> 14:11.570
these felt-tip notes,
they're recent.

14:11.610 --> 14:12.872
How do you know?

14:12.920 --> 14:14.444
I know.

14:14.480 --> 14:17.119
Yes, but I need to know
how you know

14:17.150 --> 14:18.947
so I can act
upon your knowledge.

14:21.090 --> 14:23.320
This is a xerox of a xerox.

14:23.360 --> 14:26.386
The original notations
are faded.

14:26.430 --> 14:29.558
The felt-tip notes
are faded a little less

14:29.600 --> 14:31.522
because they were
only copied once.

14:31.570 --> 14:35.062
It's the same as the
cover letter, which was
dated three days ago.

14:35.100 --> 14:38.558
And these notes,
those were from three days ago?

14:38.610 --> 14:39.929
Yes.

14:41.440 --> 14:44.045
You recognize
the handwriting?

14:46.280 --> 14:47.417
Cary? Really?

14:47.450 --> 14:49.315
He's helping them vet
their case,

14:49.350 --> 14:51.238
feeding them information.

14:51.290 --> 14:53.281
Behind enemy lines.

14:57.490 --> 14:59.651
HICKS:
Actually, I'm afraid,
in a court-martial,

14:59.690 --> 15:01.658
the prosecutor sits next
to the jury.

15:01.700 --> 15:03.565
We're-we're over, uh...

15:12.610 --> 15:14.077
All rise!

15:26.620 --> 15:27.655
Sit.

15:27.690 --> 15:28.679
Not you.

15:34.300 --> 15:35.289
(softly):
Uh-oh.

15:35.330 --> 15:37.195
ALICIA:
What?

15:37.230 --> 15:38.925
She's doing another cleanse.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.265
State your name, please.

15:42.300 --> 15:44.404
William Gardner, Your Honor,
for the defendant.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.608
I assume you're not currently
in the military, Mr. Gardner.

15:50.650 --> 15:51.548
No, Your Honor.

15:51.580 --> 15:53.445
Have you ever served
in the armed forces?

15:53.480 --> 15:55.948
No, Your Honor, but...

15:58.420 --> 15:59.546
"But," Mr. Gardner?

15:59.590 --> 16:01.615
But I have great respect

16:01.660 --> 16:03.150
for the armed forces,
Your Honor.

16:03.190 --> 16:05.385
You're familiar
with the Uniform Code

16:05.430 --> 16:07.125
of Military Justice,
Mr. Gardner?

16:07.160 --> 16:08.252
Yes, Your Honor.

16:10.600 --> 16:11.999
Call the panel.

16:20.810 --> 16:22.607
I want to help.

16:22.640 --> 16:24.676
No, you don't.

16:24.710 --> 16:26.177
I know things.

16:26.210 --> 16:27.768
You want to help?

16:27.820 --> 16:29.310
Stay in school,
don't do drugs.

16:29.350 --> 16:31.147
It's my mom, isn't it?

16:31.190 --> 16:33.249
She won't let me?

16:33.290 --> 16:35.155
It's your mom,
it's your dad, it's me.

16:35.190 --> 16:37.579
I do not need
Encyclopedia Brown on my staff.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.359
I know things.

16:42.260 --> 16:43.796
You want to help?

16:43.830 --> 16:45.627
Don't tell your girlfriend
to volunteer.

16:45.670 --> 16:46.694
My girlfriend?

16:46.730 --> 16:48.061
Mm-hmm, the blonde.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.499
Becca.
Mm-hmm.

16:49.540 --> 16:51.030
Becca.

16:51.070 --> 16:52.537
Don't send her my way.

16:52.570 --> 16:53.730
I didn't.

16:53.780 --> 16:54.701
We broke up.

16:58.580 --> 16:59.672
(scoffs)

16:59.710 --> 17:00.870
I'll talk to her.

17:00.920 --> 17:04.811
No. She wanted me to talk to you
so you would talk to her.

17:04.850 --> 17:07.318
I appear to be off
my game today.

17:07.360 --> 17:10.056
Let it rest.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.696
WILL: And what do you mean
by that, Corporal?

17:16.730 --> 17:17.822
I'm just saying,
my sister was

17:17.870 --> 17:19.667
a victim of
domestic Violence.

17:19.700 --> 17:22.168
So you're saying you can't be
impartial towards a man

17:22.200 --> 17:24.464
accused of violence
against a woman?

17:24.510 --> 17:25.738
I guess it depends
on the evidence.

17:25.770 --> 17:27.704
Your Honor, we challenge
this juror for cause

17:27.740 --> 17:28.934
on the grounds of bias.

17:28.980 --> 17:31.608
Corporal Barnard, if I order you
to be unbiased, will you be?

17:31.650 --> 17:33.311
Yes, ma'am.

17:33.350 --> 17:35.170
Good. You're seated.

17:36.320 --> 17:38.140
Mr. Gardner, Captain Gossett,

17:38.190 --> 17:40.317
pretrial motions in my chambers.

17:48.900 --> 17:51.619
As you can see, they're
clearly more prejudicial

17:51.670 --> 17:52.796
than probative, Your Honor.

17:52.830 --> 17:53.797
Denied.

17:53.840 --> 17:54.499
Excuse me?

17:54.540 --> 17:56.292
Did the police take the photos?

17:56.340 --> 17:56.965
Yes.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.501
Is that your client in them?

17:58.540 --> 17:59.837
Yes, but...

17:59.870 --> 18:01.735
Then they come in.
The jury's smart enough

18:01.780 --> 18:03.771
to separate the prejudicial
from the probative. What's next?

18:03.810 --> 18:05.448
The defendant made
a statement to the police

18:05.480 --> 18:06.708
on the night in question.
Your Honor,

18:06.750 --> 18:08.877
Mr. Simmons was
highly intoxicated.

18:08.920 --> 18:11.582
People v. Kearns, intoxication
renders a police statement

18:11.620 --> 18:12.780
inherently unreliable.

18:12.820 --> 18:15.584
Kearns is an Illinois state
case. It doesn't apply here.

18:15.620 --> 18:16.689
The statement comes in.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.382
Your Honor, in light of these
unexpected rulings,

18:19.430 --> 18:21.125
I have to request a continuance.

18:21.160 --> 18:24.721
Denied. I've got nine active
duty soldiers on that jury.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.466
I will not allow you
to waste their time.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.730
Now it's 1700 hours.

18:29.770 --> 18:30.839
We'll take a short break

18:30.870 --> 18:33.179
for dinner, and begin testimony
at 1800 hours sharp.

18:33.210 --> 18:35.235
At 6:00, Your Honor?

18:35.280 --> 18:38.909
Yes, Mr. Gardner, at 6:00.

18:38.950 --> 18:41.418
Welcome to military court.

18:41.450 --> 18:44.749
GOSSE'I'I':
And did the defendant make a
statement to you at that time?

18:44.790 --> 18:45.745
Yes, he did.

18:45.790 --> 18:47.815
Detective Rezik, please read

18:47.860 --> 18:49.509
the highlighted part
of that statement.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.928
Detect_ive:
"She was cheating on you?"

18:53.960 --> 18:56.758
"She was sleeping with somebody,
I know she was."

18:56.800 --> 18:58.927
Detective: "Did you kill her?"

18:58.970 --> 19:03.862
Suspect: "I... I don't know."

19:03.910 --> 19:05.207
GOSSE'I'I':
Thank you.

19:05.240 --> 19:06.901
One more thing.

19:06.940 --> 19:09.238
In the course of your
investigation that night,

19:09.280 --> 19:10.907
did you search
the suspect's car?

19:10.950 --> 19:12.178
Objection, Your Honor.

19:12.210 --> 19:13.370
Counsel approach.

19:14.520 --> 19:17.614
Your Honor, the police had
no warrant to search the car.

19:17.650 --> 19:19.789
They asked the defendant if they
could search his property.

19:19.820 --> 19:21.219
He said yes.

19:22.760 --> 19:24.523
It was parked
two blocks away, Your Honor.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.357
It's the reasonable man
doctrine.

19:26.390 --> 19:28.449
Judge, he assumed
they meant his home.

19:28.500 --> 19:32.288
Strictly construed, his car
is his property, Mr. Gardner.

19:32.330 --> 19:33.729
Overruled.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.866
GOSSE'I'I':
Please answer the
question, Detective.

19:38.910 --> 19:42.368
REZIK: We did search his car,
and we found a backpack,

19:42.410 --> 19:45.299
containing the defendant's
passport, a wig,

19:45.350 --> 19:49.878
and also an envelope containing
$2,000 in cash.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.785
Look, we got this excluded
in state court,

19:51.820 --> 19:53.412
so we never had
to ask this before:

19:53.460 --> 19:55.883
why was that stuff in your car?

19:55.920 --> 19:57.729
If you were scared,

19:57.760 --> 19:59.387
that you would be arrested
for something you didn't do,

19:59.430 --> 20:00.897
we can work with that.

20:00.930 --> 20:02.818
That's not it. It's...

20:08.900 --> 20:11.505
They were calling my unit up
to Afghanistan.

20:11.540 --> 20:13.007
We were all getting deployed,

20:13.040 --> 20:15.508
SO...

20:15.540 --> 20:18.407
I was gonna flee to Canada.

20:18.450 --> 20:20.975
I was going AWOL.

20:23.650 --> 20:28.280
Whatever you do, you can't tell
that to a military jury.

20:31.560 --> 20:32.959
Then what do we do?

20:49.040 --> 20:50.940
So, I'm free now.

20:50.980 --> 20:52.049
Yo
ul
re.. ?

20:52.080 --> 20:53.342
Yesterday.

20:53.380 --> 20:54.540
You needed me?

20:54.580 --> 20:56.047
Oh, that.
Actually, Blake's handling it.

20:56.080 --> 20:59.015
Derrick said you were on Murphy/
Gomes and I should use Blake.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.454
Yeah.

21:02.490 --> 21:03.957
Good luck.

21:10.030 --> 21:12.294
I know that we have
to drop one of them.

21:12.330 --> 21:13.467
It happens with every merger.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.798
I would argue that

21:15.840 --> 21:18.434
we find new representation
for Mr. Dobbs

21:18.470 --> 21:20.574
and stick with the client
who's been with us longest.

21:20.610 --> 21:21.770
That's all.

21:21.810 --> 21:23.505
DERRICK:
I hate this.
I know we all do,

21:23.550 --> 21:27.577
but both of our firms faced
economic ruin independently,

21:27.620 --> 21:28.769
and in my opinion...

21:28.820 --> 21:30.310
(group laughing)

21:30.350 --> 21:31.942
We're busy in here.

21:34.020 --> 21:36.284
Just give us five
minutes, please.

21:39.830 --> 21:41.457
Sorry.

21:42.630 --> 21:45.599
Here are the billable hours

21:45.630 --> 21:49.339
attached to
Mr. Trippi's account.

21:49.370 --> 21:50.837
And here...

21:50.870 --> 21:53.873
are the hours attached
to Mr. Dobbs.

22:03.820 --> 22:05.845
(door closes)

22:05.890 --> 22:07.710
I thought you said
two votes to one.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.580
That's why we did it this way.

22:09.620 --> 22:11.019
And I thought you said
we weren't

22:11.060 --> 22:12.550
going to follow cases on a whim.

22:12.590 --> 22:14.091
This isn't a whim.

22:14.130 --> 22:16.098
Did you see the difference?

22:16.130 --> 22:17.427
Joe has been with us longer.

22:17.470 --> 22:18.892
And Lou brings us more work.

22:18.930 --> 22:21.694
Derrick more work.
No, us more work.

22:21.740 --> 22:23.731
There's no Derrick anymore.
There's no us.

22:23.770 --> 22:25.135
This is a betrayal.

22:25.170 --> 22:26.728
You said that you
would support me.

22:26.770 --> 22:27.873
I didn't see the facts.

22:27.910 --> 22:29.605
Now the facts are important
to you?

22:29.640 --> 22:31.608
In court,
you couldn't give a damn.

22:31.650 --> 22:32.947
Come on, Diane.
It's money.

22:32.980 --> 22:35.016
It's about keeping
our doors open.

22:35.050 --> 22:36.540
My dad drove his business
into the ground

22:36.580 --> 22:37.808
giving money
to everyone he knew.

22:37.850 --> 22:39.112
And I'm not going to make
the same mistake.

22:39.150 --> 22:40.959
You know what you just did?

22:42.120 --> 22:44.850
You just lost your certain vote.

22:53.600 --> 22:54.999
ZACH :
Becca !

22:55.040 --> 22:57.099
Zach.

22:58.540 --> 23:00.701
Uh-oh.

23:00.740 --> 23:01.729
What are you doing?

23:01.780 --> 23:03.668
What am I doing?
What do you mean?

23:03.710 --> 23:06.042
I mean, I didn't ask you to
volunteer for my dad's campaign.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.547
I haven't even
talked to you.

23:07.580 --> 23:10.174
Why won't you just
let me say I'm sorry?

23:10.220 --> 23:11.187
Because you're not.

23:11.220 --> 23:12.642
Iam.

23:12.690 --> 23:14.180
There's nothing else I can say.

23:14.220 --> 23:16.586
I text you,
you won't text me back.

23:16.620 --> 23:18.156
I try to wait for you
after school...

23:18.190 --> 23:19.487
You hurt my mom, my dad.

23:19.530 --> 23:20.849
I stopped.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.152
I said I'd stop,
and I stopped.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.997
My parents are getting
a divorce,

23:27.030 --> 23:28.998
and Ijust...

23:29.040 --> 23:30.166
That's funny?

23:30.200 --> 23:32.566
Yeah, actually, it is.

23:32.610 --> 23:34.032
You think it worked once,

23:34.080 --> 23:35.172
now it'll work again.

23:35.210 --> 23:36.074
What'll work?

23:36.110 --> 23:38.772
I was trying to show you
that I was sorry.

23:38.810 --> 23:41.916
Do you know how boring it is
volunteering at a campaign?

23:41.950 --> 23:44.919
Do you really think I'd do it
unless I really meant it?

23:44.950 --> 23:47.043
So you meant it. Good-bye.

23:49.120 --> 23:50.883
I know Glenn Childs.

23:50.930 --> 23:51.885
So what?

23:51.930 --> 23:54.728
No. I know Glenn Childs Jr.

23:58.100 --> 23:59.169
I don't understand.

23:59.200 --> 24:02.089
The Army did their own
investigation of the scene.

24:02.140 --> 24:05.632
They ran the prints from the
house against military records,

24:05.670 --> 24:09.174
and they only came up
with one match-- Simmons?

24:09.210 --> 24:10.541
Maybe that's all there were.

24:10.580 --> 24:12.673
But he had told me
that he had had lots

24:12.710 --> 24:14.712
of people from his unit
over to the house.

24:14.750 --> 24:16.718
By rule, Criminal
Investigation Command

24:16.750 --> 24:19.514
has to turn over every piece
of evidence that's relevant.

24:19.550 --> 24:21.654
Everything
that's relevant?

24:21.690 --> 24:23.829
Well, who decides
what's not relevant?

24:25.160 --> 24:26.286
They do.

24:26.330 --> 24:29.652
So what do they do with the
stuff that isn't relevant?

24:37.770 --> 24:39.806
I'm entitled to see the file--
all of it.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.138
MAN:
Yes, ma'am, but I cannot
release that file to you

24:42.180 --> 24:43.647
without orders
from Major Janick.

24:43.680 --> 24:44.908
And so where's
Major Janick?

24:44.950 --> 24:46.144
He's gone for the day.

24:46.180 --> 24:47.272
He'll be back
Monday at 0800.

24:47.310 --> 24:49.642
But we are due back
in court tomorrow,

24:49.680 --> 24:51.580
and if I have to get
a court order...

24:51.620 --> 24:53.178
Ma'am, unless the major
authorizes this,

24:53.220 --> 24:56.189
that's exactly what
you're going to have to do.

24:56.220 --> 24:57.187
Is there a problem,
Corporal?

24:57.220 --> 24:58.187
No, sir,
Lieutenant Hicks.

24:58.230 --> 24:59.652
At ease, then.
And get the file.

24:59.690 --> 25:01.749
Yes, sir.

25:05.330 --> 25:06.763
Sorry, Lieutenant Hicks.

25:06.800 --> 25:08.233
Congratulations
on your commendation.

25:08.270 --> 25:10.602
Are you going back, sir?

25:10.640 --> 25:12.562
Back? No, I've been
redeployed stateside.

25:12.610 --> 25:15.306
I heard Fallujah
was pretty hairy.

25:15.340 --> 25:17.228
As you were, Corporal.

25:45.840 --> 25:48.570
(phone buzzing)

25:49.640 --> 25:51.039
No. No work.

25:51.080 --> 25:52.308
Yeah, it's Will.

25:52.350 --> 25:54.170
Hi. Sorry to call so late.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.211
Uh, there's something
you might use tomorrow.

25:56.250 --> 25:58.889
Can't you do this
tomorrow?

26:00.190 --> 26:01.919
Oh, Will, I'm sorry.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.587
I-I'll phone back.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.621
No, no. That's okay.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.356
What's up?

26:10.400 --> 26:13.369
Um, well, this is what
the CID deemed irrelevant.

26:13.400 --> 26:14.537
I, uh...

26:14.570 --> 26:17.232
Three pairs of fingerprints
found at the crime scene.

26:17.270 --> 26:20.364
We found matches for all of
them in the military database.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.638
Three new suspects? Good.

26:25.680 --> 26:27.568
We'll work up subpoenas.

26:30.080 --> 26:31.616
Thanks, Alicia.

26:32.650 --> 26:34.288
See you tomorrow.

26:49.170 --> 26:50.660
Kalinda.

26:57.780 --> 26:59.771
What do you know
about Derrick Bond?

27:04.920 --> 27:06.649
What do I know?

27:06.690 --> 27:09.181
Well, I did the due diligence.

27:09.220 --> 27:11.051
Everything I found, you have.

27:13.330 --> 27:16.197
What about Derrick Bond
and Will?

27:16.230 --> 27:17.390
Sorry?

27:17.430 --> 27:21.764
As far as I knew, there was
no connection between them.

27:21.800 --> 27:24.200
I was the connection to Derrick.

27:25.810 --> 27:29.405
You're suggesting there's a link
that you don't know about.

27:29.440 --> 27:33.342
I'm suggesting I'd like
to be disabused of that notion.

27:36.120 --> 27:38.714
Then, I'll get to disabusing.

27:40.050 --> 27:41.210
Three sets of fingerprints,
Your Honor--

27:41.260 --> 27:43.057
his unit leader
Captain Gerald Gauthier,

27:43.090 --> 27:46.184
Private Luis Suarez
and Corporal Bradley Vernik.

27:46.230 --> 27:49.028
There were dozens of prints
at the defendant's home,

27:49.060 --> 27:49.924
most of them
unidentified.

27:49.960 --> 27:51.894
But these were identified,
Your Honor,

27:51.930 --> 27:54.034
and they weren't part
of the discovery in state court

27:54.070 --> 27:55.697
because the prints aren't
in Chicago PD's database--

27:55.740 --> 27:59.369
only the military database--
so we've never seen them before.

27:59.410 --> 28:00.160
Your Honor, we'll stipulate

28:00.210 --> 28:01.279
these men spent time
at his home.

28:01.310 --> 28:04.438
Corporal Vernik has
a military record, Your Honor--

28:04.480 --> 28:06.345
an assault charge
against an ex-girlfriend.

28:06.380 --> 28:08.712
No official complaint
was ever pursued.

28:08.750 --> 28:09.546
The complaint was withdrawn.

28:09.580 --> 28:11.343
And you know this how,
Mr. Gardner?

28:11.390 --> 28:14.052
It's in the military
investigator's notes,

28:14.090 --> 28:16.354
Your Honor, which also refer
to phone records

28:16.390 --> 28:17.550
indicating repeated calls

28:17.590 --> 28:19.820
between the defendant's home
and Corporal Vernik's home.

28:19.860 --> 28:22.727
Your Honor, if defense counsel
is insinuating something...

28:22.760 --> 28:24.068
Oh, I'm... I'm doing
more than that.

28:24.100 --> 28:26.022
The prosecution's theory
is that my client

28:26.070 --> 28:28.459
killed his wife because she was
sleeping With someone else.

28:28.500 --> 28:29.967
I submit that someone else
was Corporal Vernik,

28:30.000 --> 28:31.308
in which case
he's a prime suspect

28:31.340 --> 28:33.365
and we need to call him
as a Witness.

28:33.410 --> 28:35.332
Your Honor,
I'm afraid that's impossible.

28:35.380 --> 28:36.836
And Why is that?

28:36.880 --> 28:38.507
Corporal Vernik was killed
three months ago

28:38.550 --> 28:40.745
in the Marjeh
offensive.

28:44.850 --> 28:47.978
Well, then, in which case
we ask to call the other two--

28:48.020 --> 28:49.988
Private Suarez
and Captain Gauthier.

28:50.020 --> 28:51.351
They're also in Afghanistan.

28:51.390 --> 28:53.085
_ We can
Videoconference them.

28:53.130 --> 28:54.222
We can Videoconference them.

28:56.300 --> 28:59.326
I'm not calling soldiers away
from active duty overseas.

28:59.370 --> 29:01.235
Not for a fishing expedition.

29:01.270 --> 29:02.532
Well, then, we ask
for a continuance

29:02.570 --> 29:04.106
until their testimony
can be obtained.

29:04.140 --> 29:05.164
Denied.

29:05.210 --> 29:06.461
I already told you,
Mr. Gardner.

29:07.510 --> 29:10.035
Now, do you have
anything else?

29:19.290 --> 29:21.815
I move that you recuse yourself
from this trial immediately.

29:22.820 --> 29:25.129
Excuse me, Mr. Gardner?

29:25.160 --> 29:28.254
I don't know if it's because you
don't like civilian lawyers,

29:28.300 --> 29:29.949
or something psychological...

29:30.000 --> 29:31.467
Mr. Gardner...
But I-I'm starting to see

29:31.500 --> 29:34.333
why all those Guantanamo
prosecutors resigned.

29:34.370 --> 29:36.497
The system is rigged
against the defendant.

29:36.540 --> 29:37.802
Uh, Your Honor,
ifI could just...

29:37.840 --> 29:39.307
You're in contempt, Mr. Gardner.

29:39.340 --> 29:40.500
Another word, I'll
have you removed

29:40.540 --> 29:42.428
for the duration
of the trial.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.368
You've already
removed me

29:44.410 --> 29:46.173
for the duration of the trial.

29:46.210 --> 29:48.974
That's it. Bailiff,
take Mr. Gardner to the ICF.

29:49.020 --> 29:51.341
Your Honor, the defense calls
for a continuance.

29:51.390 --> 29:52.812
I said no continuances.

29:52.850 --> 29:54.454
Yes, Your Honor,
but that was before

29:54.490 --> 29:56.287
you removed our counsel
of record.

29:56.320 --> 30:00.359
Uh, pursuant
to the rule 866.2

30:00.390 --> 30:01.994
of the Military Code,
when the judge orders

30:02.030 --> 30:03.827
a change of counsel,

30:03.870 --> 30:06.122
the defense is entitled
to a continuance.

30:06.170 --> 30:07.967
There are two of you.
Neither myself

30:08.000 --> 30:11.128
or Lieutenant Hicks
are, um, listed

30:11.170 --> 30:13.832
on a-any pleadings,
Your Honor.

30:13.880 --> 30:16.132
Um, the rule is very clear.

30:16.180 --> 30:18.546
Only listed counsel qualify.

30:20.010 --> 30:22.570
Hell of a way to get
a continuance, Mr. Gardner.

30:24.620 --> 30:27.248
You have 24 hours.
(bangs gavel)

30:36.630 --> 30:38.621
So Hicks has a Silver Star?

30:38.670 --> 30:40.934
Apparently,
he single-handedly fought

30:40.970 --> 30:43.461
a convoy of insurgents
in Fallujah.

30:43.500 --> 30:44.831
Saved 20 men.

30:46.940 --> 30:50.171
I... I don't know
What to say about that.

30:50.210 --> 30:51.370
Well, don't say anything.

30:51.410 --> 30:52.638
It embarrasses him.

30:52.680 --> 30:55.069
Oh, now he's just
making me feel inadequate.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.576
I spring for someone's
valet parking,

30:56.620 --> 30:58.508
I brag about it for a week.

30:59.620 --> 31:01.212
Okay.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.854
You are now officially
counsel of record.

31:10.230 --> 31:11.197
What?

31:12.700 --> 31:15.362
I just thought I was done
visiting men in prison.

31:20.940 --> 31:22.168
But I let my client go.

31:22.210 --> 31:23.438
DERRICK:
I know, but, uh,

31:23.480 --> 31:25.004
Lou Dobbs still fired us.

31:25.050 --> 31:27.075
He apparently doesn't believe
the partners

31:27.110 --> 31:28.941
have his best interests
at heart.

31:28.980 --> 31:30.072
The partners?

31:30.120 --> 31:31.485
Me, you mean?

31:32.550 --> 31:33.744
He left the door open.

31:33.790 --> 31:36.452
I convinced him to hear from you
or Will that you're on board.

31:36.490 --> 31:38.128
Will is in the brig.

31:38.160 --> 31:40.355
Don't ask.

31:40.390 --> 31:41.994
Is tomorrow good for you?

31:42.030 --> 31:43.122
To convince Lou Dobbs

31:43.160 --> 31:45.469
that I have his best
interests at heart?

31:45.500 --> 31:47.934
(chuckling)

31:47.970 --> 31:49.631
Sure.

31:49.670 --> 31:51.934
Tell Lou I'll be right over.

31:59.380 --> 32:03.214
Your suspect, Corporal Vernik,
the one who died in Afghanistan.

32:03.250 --> 32:04.012
Yeah?

32:04.050 --> 32:05.449
His death benefits
are being paid

32:05.490 --> 32:06.980
to his girlfriend.

32:07.020 --> 32:08.351
Uh, Daria Joyce.

32:08.390 --> 32:10.381
That's the address.

32:12.590 --> 32:14.592
Kalinda.

32:17.030 --> 32:18.668
Brad never cheated on me--
not once.

32:18.700 --> 32:21.032
Ms. Joyce, we're very sorry
for your loss.

32:21.070 --> 32:22.992
But we have
phone records showing

32:23.040 --> 32:25.008
that Corporal Bradley Vernik
phoned the victim.

32:25.040 --> 32:26.405
Those calls were from me.

32:26.440 --> 32:27.702
Judith and I were friends.

32:27.740 --> 32:29.401
Until your client killed her.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.044
But why would he do that

32:31.080 --> 32:32.741
if she wasn't
cheating on him?

32:32.780 --> 32:34.372
I never said she wasn't sleeping
with someone.

32:34.420 --> 32:35.614
I said it wasn't Brad.

32:37.620 --> 32:39.588
Ms. Joyce,
if you know something

32:39.620 --> 32:41.588
and could shed
some light on this...

32:41.620 --> 32:43.019
Why would I tell you?

32:43.060 --> 32:44.550
Because, otherwise,
Corporal Bradley Vernik

32:44.590 --> 32:46.023
is the only name we have,

32:46.060 --> 32:47.425
anditsthe
name we'll use.

32:47.460 --> 32:50.190
We'll say he cheated on you
and he killed the girl.

32:51.630 --> 32:53.268
Those are lies.

32:53.300 --> 32:54.699
Then, tell us who Judith
had a relationship with.

32:55.740 --> 32:57.696
She was trying
to save her husband.

32:57.740 --> 32:59.105
Save him how?

33:02.440 --> 33:05.739
The CD. of their unit--

33:05.780 --> 33:09.341
Gauthier-- he said he
could pull some strings,

33:09.380 --> 33:11.780
keep Randall
off the deployment list.

33:11.820 --> 33:14.357
But there was
a price for it.

33:18.060 --> 33:19.652
And Judith
believed him?

33:19.690 --> 33:21.248
She was so desperate
to keep Randall home,

33:21.300 --> 33:22.324
she'd have believed anything.

33:22.360 --> 33:25.295
Ms. Joyce, I need you
to tell this to the court.

33:27.130 --> 33:29.462
No. Absolutely not.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.661
Well, we can subpoena
you if we have to.
I'll lie.

33:31.710 --> 33:32.859
And the Army will let me.

33:32.910 --> 33:34.798
You think they want their
dirty laundry aired in public?

33:34.840 --> 33:36.808
I think a man
is on trial for his life.

33:36.840 --> 33:40.139
Your client killed his Wife,
Mrs. Florrick.

33:40.180 --> 33:44.139
He was jealous of her sleeping
with another man.

33:44.190 --> 33:46.181
And the sad thing is,

33:46.220 --> 33:48.518
she was just trying
to keep him home.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.054
BECCA:
Let me.

34:02.300 --> 34:03.392
How do you know him?

34:03.440 --> 34:04.737
Glenn Jr?

34:04.770 --> 34:06.567
Drama camp.

34:06.610 --> 34:08.475
He was a real jerk.

34:08.510 --> 34:10.774
That's how I got these pictures.

34:10.810 --> 34:13.074
So, what, you're hacking
his account?

34:13.110 --> 34:15.146
No. He doesn't have one.

34:15.180 --> 34:17.410
I'm creating it.

34:18.820 --> 34:20.287
There.

34:20.320 --> 34:22.254
Meet Glenn Childs Jr.

34:22.290 --> 34:23.587
You can't do that.

34:23.620 --> 34:25.429
I just did. What is he into?

34:25.460 --> 34:26.825
What are his, uh,
personal interests?

34:28.500 --> 34:30.297
Miley Cyrus.
(laughs)

34:30.330 --> 34:32.127
The Jonas Brothers.

34:32.170 --> 34:34.297
We should have him

34:34.340 --> 34:35.796
say something about his dad.

34:35.840 --> 34:38.161
Something bad.

34:39.840 --> 34:41.603
We're not really doing this.

34:42.640 --> 34:43.800
What do you mean?

34:43.840 --> 34:46.104
I mean, this is all
just fun, right?

34:46.150 --> 34:48.675
We're not really doing this.

34:50.850 --> 34:54.149
BECCA:
Well, they really did this...

34:54.190 --> 34:58.320
* Leave your Wife
and your mistrial *

34:58.360 --> 35:01.591
* 'Cause I want to kiss
* Peter Florrick. *

35:05.570 --> 35:07.788
So, uh, everybody
gets one of those?

35:08.870 --> 35:10.667
Oh, for the firm, yes.

35:10.700 --> 35:11.906
We're trying to go paperless.

35:11.940 --> 35:14.272
At JAG,
we're trying to go paper.

35:18.210 --> 35:19.802
You like the military?

35:21.450 --> 35:23.475
There's no other life.

35:24.620 --> 35:26.781
Wait. Look at this
draft Witness list.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.109
ALICIA:
Cary's writing again.

35:30.160 --> 35:32.924
KALINDA:
He wrote "no" next to
Daria Joyce's initials.

35:32.960 --> 35:34.928
He knew not
to call her to the stand

35:34.960 --> 35:37.258
because he already
interviewed her.

35:37.300 --> 35:38.892
His testimony is hearsay.

35:38.930 --> 35:40.761
Daria will just refute it.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.836
Right.

35:45.470 --> 35:47.859
ALICIA:
Ms. Joyce, did the victim
ever confide in you

35:47.910 --> 35:49.901
that she was sleeping with
someone other than her husband?

35:49.940 --> 35:53.273
No, she did not.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.572
Nothing further.

35:56.620 --> 35:58.383
The Defense
calls Cary Agos.

35:58.420 --> 36:00.217
Objection, Your Honor.

36:00.250 --> 36:02.286
Mr. Agos is not
on the defense Witness list.

36:02.320 --> 36:04.925
Rule 607 of the Rules
for Court-Martial, Your Honor.

36:04.960 --> 36:06.279
He doesn't have to be

36:06.330 --> 36:07.729
if I'm calling him
as an impeachment Witness.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.397
Overruled.

36:13.770 --> 36:16.193
Mr. Agos...
first of all, hello.

36:16.240 --> 36:17.696
Hello.

36:17.740 --> 36:21.528
You persecuted Mr. S...
excuse me-- prosecuted

36:21.580 --> 36:24.208
Mr. Simmons for the murder
of his Wife in state court?

36:24.250 --> 36:25.376
I did.

36:25.410 --> 36:26.707
You were there.
You remember that?

36:26.750 --> 36:27.876
I do.

36:27.910 --> 36:30.242
And when you
couldn't convict him,

36:30.280 --> 36:31.884
you convinced
Captain Melinda Gossett

36:31.920 --> 36:33.239
to try him in
military court.

36:33.290 --> 36:34.257
Objection.

36:34.290 --> 36:35.917
Sustained. Mrs. Florrick.

36:38.790 --> 36:40.257
Mr. Agos,

36:40.290 --> 36:43.259
did you personally
interview Ms. Joyce

36:43.300 --> 36:45.723
just prior
to this trial commencing?

36:50.270 --> 36:53.433
I did.

36:53.470 --> 36:57.236
And did she convey to you
her suspicions that the victim

36:57.280 --> 37:00.443
had been sleeping with someone
other than her husband?

37:02.320 --> 37:06.313
Ms. Joyce told me
that she believed

37:06.350 --> 37:08.682
Mrs. Simmons had been sleeping

37:08.720 --> 37:10.984
with the defendant's
commanding officer.

37:11.020 --> 37:12.578
And that would be
Captain Gauthier?

37:12.630 --> 37:13.824
That's right.

37:13.860 --> 37:15.691
Your Honor,
I have to object here

37:15.730 --> 37:16.958
on grounds
of relevance.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.922
Overruled.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.494
Please continue,
Mrs. Florrick.

37:20.530 --> 37:22.498
ALICIA:
And did she believe
there were reasons

37:22.540 --> 37:25.008
for this sexual activity?

37:25.040 --> 37:28.339
Captain Gauthier had told her

37:28.380 --> 37:30.769
he could keep the defendant
from being deployed,

37:30.810 --> 37:32.539
in exchange for sex.

37:39.750 --> 37:42.958
ALICIA:
Your Honor, based on
Mr. Agos's testimony,

37:42.990 --> 37:45.720
we ask that we be allowed

37:45.760 --> 37:49.059
to question Captain Gauthier
overseas via teleconference.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.294
Objection.

37:51.370 --> 37:52.564
Overruled.

38:01.070 --> 38:02.879
BAILIFF:
Captain Gauthier,
do you swear to tell the truth,

38:02.910 --> 38:04.741
the Whole truth and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?

38:04.780 --> 38:06.600
GAUTHIER:
I do.

38:06.650 --> 38:09.915
So you were at the bar that
night with Specialist Simmons?

38:09.950 --> 38:11.611
Yes, ma'am.

38:11.650 --> 38:15.086
I left at 2300 hours,
and drove Corporal Vernik

38:15.120 --> 38:17.714
and Private Suarez
back to the base.

38:17.760 --> 38:18.920
And then, Where did
you go, Captain?

38:18.960 --> 38:20.450
I went home.

38:20.490 --> 38:22.629
So you didn't make a stop

38:22.660 --> 38:24.469
at the home of the defendant?

38:24.500 --> 38:25.797
No, I didn't.

38:25.830 --> 38:26.967
Because Mrs. Simmons
threatened you,

38:27.000 --> 38:28.467
didn't she, Captain?

38:28.500 --> 38:30.639
She was going
to tell her husband that you'd

38:30.670 --> 38:32.331
extorted sexual favors from her.

38:32.370 --> 38:33.598
No.

38:33.640 --> 38:37.633
You told her that you could keep
her husband from being deployed.

38:37.680 --> 38:38.874
No.

38:38.910 --> 38:40.673
I don't have that authority.

38:40.710 --> 38:42.348
But she didn't know
that, did she?

38:42.380 --> 38:44.814
And when you didn't make good
on your promise,

38:44.850 --> 38:46.943
she threatened you,
and you went to her home.

38:48.690 --> 38:50.112
You went to her home,

38:50.160 --> 38:52.856
and you stabbed her 38 times.

38:55.160 --> 38:56.650
KUHN:
Captain Gauthier,

38:56.700 --> 38:59.863
this is Colonel Leora Kuhn,
acting judge.

38:59.900 --> 39:02.767
Do you require
counsel, Captain?

39:05.610 --> 39:07.601
Counsel?

39:08.910 --> 39:10.798
I want...

39:12.050 --> 39:13.574
Captain Gauthier?

39:18.890 --> 39:21.415
KUHN:
Captain?

39:23.620 --> 39:25.884
So you're saying
you can set aside

39:25.930 --> 39:27.682
your personal
political convictions

39:27.730 --> 39:30.949
when it comes to representing
me and my interests?

39:32.730 --> 39:34.732
Truthfully,
I can never put aside

39:34.770 --> 39:36.635
my personal political
convictions.

39:36.670 --> 39:39.935
What I'm saying
is they won't be an issue.

39:39.970 --> 39:40.937
IfI can represent murderers

39:40.970 --> 39:42.904
when I think they're guilty,
I can represent you.

39:42.940 --> 39:45.579
(chuckling):
Well, that's damn decent of you.

39:45.610 --> 39:47.441
A real vote
of confidence.

39:47.480 --> 39:49.812
Why do I get the feeling that
Derrick Bond put you up to this?

39:49.850 --> 39:51.909
Well, he did,
but I would have turned him down

39:51.950 --> 39:53.941
if I didn't
believe it.

39:53.990 --> 39:56.618
You come back
with Derrick as your lawyer,

39:56.660 --> 39:58.548
and we will not have a problem.

39:58.590 --> 39:59.921
You have my word on that.

40:02.830 --> 40:04.866
(sighs)

40:06.600 --> 40:08.568
I'll come back.

40:08.600 --> 40:10.591
But I don't want Derrick
as my attorney.

40:10.640 --> 40:11.937
I want you.

40:11.970 --> 40:13.062
Me?

40:13.110 --> 40:14.839
(laughs) No.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.201
You've been more up-front
with me in the past 25 minutes

40:17.240 --> 40:19.447
than any attorney
I've dealt with.

40:19.480 --> 40:22.972
And I like the fact you won't
betray your convictions.

40:26.550 --> 40:28.484
Think about it.

40:29.690 --> 40:31.885
(door opens)

40:31.930 --> 40:34.899
(door closes)

40:37.030 --> 40:39.021
(gavel banging)

40:41.100 --> 40:42.761
(clears throat)

40:42.800 --> 40:44.233
In the matter of
The United States

40:44.270 --> 40:45.828
v. Specialist Randall Simmons,

40:45.870 --> 40:48.930
on the charge of murder
under Section 118

40:48.980 --> 40:51.699
of the Uniform Code
of Military Justice,

40:51.750 --> 40:53.843
we the panel find
the defendant...

40:53.880 --> 40:56.519
not guilty.

41:18.810 --> 41:19.936
Thank you.

41:21.980 --> 41:24.130
Dad, I'm free.

41:45.100 --> 41:46.658
CARY:
Hey, Alicia.

41:48.100 --> 41:49.829
Congratulations.

41:49.870 --> 41:51.906
He didn't do it, Cary.

41:51.940 --> 41:53.965
Captain Gauthier
went AWOL.

41:54.010 --> 41:55.204
There's your suspect.

41:55.240 --> 41:58.004
You know, your client, now that
he's been found not guilty,

41:58.040 --> 42:00.008
it frees him up
to serve out his commitment.

42:00.050 --> 42:01.005
