40:46.280 --> 40:49.649

with Asha today.

40:51.019 --> 40:53.819
Yeah, I found her hiding
in the dark.

40:53.954 --> 40:55.487
I guess she's not
the only person

40:55.623 --> 40:58.757

I knew from the moment
I saw her

41:01.362 --> 41:05.631
that this New Eden story
didn't add up.

41:05.766 --> 41:07.700
You set course on a lie.

41:07.702 --> 41:10.636
- Careful.
- Does Ruth know?

41:12.306 --> 41:15.173
You twisted her too?
- Pike.

41:15.309 --> 41:18.044
- She was perfect
before you came back.

41:18.178 --> 41:19.778
- Did you tell anyone else?

41:19.780 --> 41:22.248
- Political implications.
That's your concern, huh?

41:22.383 --> 41:23.849
Here are my terms.

41:23.984 --> 41:26.118
I'll give you a chance
to keep your lie alive.

41:26.120 --> 41:27.786
