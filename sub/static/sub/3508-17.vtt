WEBVTT

00:00.458 --> 00:01.437
There are two kinds of folks

00:01.464 --> 00:03.064
who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:

00:03.398 --> 00:05.124
psychopaths
and mystery writers.

00:05.362 --> 00:06.384
I'm the kind that pays better.

00:06.785 --> 00:07.385
Who am I?

00:07.474 --> 00:08.613
I'm Rick Castle.

00:08.614 --> 00:09.014
Castle.

00:09.048 --> 00:09.708
Castle.

00:09.709 --> 00:11.709
I really am ruggedly handsome,
aren't I?

00:11.855 --> 00:14.045
Every writer needs  inspiration.
And I found mine.

00:14.255 --> 00:15.074
Detective Kate Beckett.

00:15.109 --> 00:16.129
- Beckett.
- Beckett.

00:16.164 --> 00:18.070
- Nikki Heat?
- The character he's basing on you.

00:18.116 --> 00:19.602
And thanks to my friendship
with the mayor,

00:19.603 --> 00:20.603
I get to be on her case.

00:20.637 --> 00:22.580
I would be happy
to let you spank me.

00:22.615 --> 00:23.491
And together, we catch killers

00:24.439 --> 00:25.427
We make a pretty
good team, you know?

00:25.428 --> 00:26.428
Like Starsky and Hutch.

00:26.562 --> 00:27.256
Turner and Hooch.

00:27.619 --> 00:29.219
You do remind me
a little of Hooch.

00:34.243 --> 00:38.138
♪ 7 stars in the sky,
in the sky ♪

00:38.173 --> 00:40.204
Yeah, Paula,
that sounds perfect.

00:40.238 --> 00:41.736
Yeah, close the deal.

00:41.771 --> 00:43.501
Thank you. And to you.

00:43.535 --> 00:45.866
Hey.
Hey.

00:45.900 --> 00:48.730
Ask me why I'm here.
You know, I ask myself
that question every day.

00:48.765 --> 00:50.630
That was Paula, my agent,
with big news

00:50.665 --> 00:52.862
about my book "Heat Wave."
mm-hmm.

00:52.897 --> 00:55.694
Wanna guess?
Guessing would imply caring.

00:55.729 --> 00:57.195
I'll give you a hint.

00:57.228 --> 00:59.128
The headlines in the trades
might read,

00:59.162 --> 01:04.525
"Castle best seller
to 'heat' up big screen."

01:04.560 --> 01:06.557
Your book is being made
into a movie?

01:06.591 --> 01:08.557
And you are about to be
immortalized

01:08.591 --> 01:10.457
on the silver screen.

01:10.492 --> 01:14.492
Actually, Nikki Heat is going
to be immortalized, not me.
Yes, well, technically,

01:14.527 --> 01:17.095
but it's been widely publicized
that you are the inspiration.

01:17.129 --> 01:19.592
So who would you like
to play you in the movie?
whoa. Are you kidding?

01:19.626 --> 01:21.357
They're really making
a Nikki Heat movie?

01:21.391 --> 01:23.625
Dude, did I call it or what?
Ah, congrats, bro.

01:23.830 --> 01:25.731
Thank you!
What do you think,

01:25.765 --> 01:28.198
can we get James McAvoy
for Detective Raley?

01:28.232 --> 01:30.198
I'm gonna go
with Javier Bardem.
Beckett.

01:30.233 --> 01:32.696
In your casting dreams.
Yes, I'd like to report a murder.

01:33.943 --> 01:35.609
Do you have an address?

01:35.794 --> 01:37.994
Where's the fun in that?

01:38.028 --> 01:40.061
<i>Okay.</i>

01:41.070 --> 01:42.735
Who is this?

01:42.770 --> 01:44.102
Oh, a fan.

01:44.137 --> 01:47.436
Tell me more about this murder.
Tracing.

01:47.470 --> 01:48.870
Well, I did it.

01:48.904 --> 01:50.904
And that's all
you need to know.

01:50.938 --> 01:52.371
Got it.

01:52.405 --> 01:54.705
Hello?
42nd and Lex.

01:54.739 --> 01:57.139
That's Grand Central Station.
Yeah, let's go.

01:58.680 --> 01:59.980
According to tech,

02:00.014 --> 02:02.747
The phone call came from
the second booth on the end.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.644 --> 02:31.010
Here's his wallet.

02:32.812 --> 02:33.612
Thank you.

02:33.747 --> 02:34.646
You got it.

02:34.793 --> 02:37.359
His name's Alex Peterman,
lives in Dobbs Ferry.

02:37.393 --> 02:39.460
So it wasn't a robbery.

02:39.494 --> 02:41.028
He's a personal injury attorney.

02:41.062 --> 02:42.428
Taking the late train home.

02:42.463 --> 02:43.963
Anything
other than G.S.W.S?

02:43.997 --> 02:47.365
Nope, just the 5 shots
to the chest from a .45.

02:47.399 --> 02:49.933
A .45 makes a pretty loud
snap, crackle and pop.

02:49.968 --> 02:52.535
I find it hard to believe no one
heard it on the main concourse.

02:52.945 --> 02:54.245
He must have used
a suppressor

02:54.270 --> 02:56.071
and waited for the train
to pass by.

02:56.081 --> 02:57.781
And let's face it--
New Yorkers are famous

02:57.805 --> 03:00.272
for their "hear no evil,
see no evil" attitude.

03:00.306 --> 03:01.539
I'll give you a call
with an update

03:01.540 --> 03:03.741
once I get him back to the lab.
Thank you.

03:03.775 --> 03:06.943
Quick--who do you want to play
you in the Nikki Heat movie?
Halle Berry.

03:06.977 --> 03:09.843
See? Some people
are just great at that game.

03:09.877 --> 03:13.077
You know who we could get
for you? Angelina. No.

03:13.112 --> 03:15.946
Kate Beckett,
Kate Beckinsale.

03:15.980 --> 03:17.947
We'll call you K-Becks.

03:17.981 --> 03:19.983
Hey, guys,
where are we on the case?

03:19.993 --> 03:21.813
We got a woman
who says that she heard

03:21.817 --> 03:23.417
a loud sound around 8:45--

03:23.452 --> 03:25.286
sounded like
a car door slamming.

03:25.296 --> 03:26.296
And she said she saw
a white male,

03:26.320 --> 03:29.755
30s, average height,
exiting the waiting room,

03:29.790 --> 03:31.192
moving very quickly
to the 42nd street exit.

03:31.202 --> 03:34.002
Said he was wearing a black
coat, black ball cap, sunglasses

03:34.627 --> 03:36.494
and had some sort of beard,
maybe a goatee.

03:36.528 --> 03:38.929
All right, let's see if anyone
can corroborate her description,

03:38.963 --> 03:41.531
and let's make up a sketch, show
it to Alex Peterman's family,

03:41.565 --> 03:44.099
See if they recognize the killer.
Right.

03:47.301 --> 03:48.601
What is it?

03:50.336 --> 03:52.671
He called
to report his crime.

03:52.705 --> 03:55.039
And that voice...

03:55.073 --> 03:58.374
it's like
he did this for fun.

04:05.514 --> 04:07.514
Hey.
You're up early.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.982
Yes, I have a date
with Beckett at the morgue.

04:10.016 --> 04:12.916
What nefarious plots
are you two hatching?
Uh--

04:12.951 --> 04:14.950
My birthday is coming up.

04:14.984 --> 04:16.817
Uh-huh.

04:16.851 --> 04:19.152
I think
you should tell him, gram.

04:19.185 --> 04:21.019
Sometimes he gives
good advice.

04:21.053 --> 04:23.486
Sometimes?
Yeah, maybe you're right.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.920
But I am not in the mood for
any of your cavalier quips.

04:26.055 --> 04:27.389
I'll be serious
as a shark attack.

04:27.399 --> 04:29.399
Chet has asked me
to move in with him.

04:31.124 --> 04:33.858
I told her... that I thought
it was too soon.

04:33.892 --> 04:35.794
They've only been dating
a few months.

04:35.885 --> 04:38.687
When you get to be our age,
every minute counts.

04:38.721 --> 04:41.790
To that end, I have made
a list of pros and cons.

04:41.824 --> 04:43.525
So far the pros are winning.

04:43.559 --> 04:46.494
"pro-- he makes me feel young."
well...

04:46.528 --> 04:49.597
I make you feel young.
Oh, darling.

04:49.631 --> 04:52.566
"cons--I don't want to live
in another man's home."

04:52.601 --> 04:55.569
You are not another man.
Besides, I trained you.

04:55.604 --> 04:57.905
Who knows what bad habits

04:57.939 --> 04:59.974
Chet picked up along the way,
you know?
Mm-hmm.

05:00.122 --> 05:02.289
Mother, whatever you decide,
I will support you,

05:03.142 --> 05:04.811
the same way I have since
the last man you lived with

05:05.049 --> 05:06.783
stole your life savings.

05:09.470 --> 05:11.471
Cause of death
is multiple gunshot wounds.

05:11.505 --> 05:14.708
Tox indicates he had a martini
about an hour before he died.

05:14.742 --> 05:16.075
Other than that,

05:16.109 --> 05:18.777
there is nothing interesting
about the body.

05:18.812 --> 05:20.779
So then why the call?

05:20.814 --> 05:23.515
The body isn't interesting.
Excuse me.

05:23.549 --> 05:25.116
But the bullets are.

05:25.150 --> 05:26.251
Check out the marking
on the end of the slugs.

05:26.423 --> 05:27.990
Aftermarket factory stamps?

05:28.025 --> 05:29.258
No.

05:29.293 --> 05:32.128
Those aren't stamps.
They're letters.

05:33.602 --> 05:36.637
And look,
they're hand-etched.

05:38.340 --> 05:40.107
They spell something.

05:40.141 --> 05:41.741
They spell...

05:41.776 --> 05:43.776
"kinki."

05:46.079 --> 05:47.612
No.

05:53.185 --> 05:54.652
"Nikki."

05:54.687 --> 05:56.487
Nikki Heat.

05:58.157 --> 06:00.125
That's why he called me.

06:00.159 --> 06:02.094
That's why he said
he was a fan.

06:02.128 --> 06:04.597
He dedicated
this murder to me.

06:06.064 --> 06:08.133
Does he realize she's a fictional
character not a real person?

06:08.324 --> 06:11.327
Obviously, he's delusional,
but given that Nikki Heat

06:11.361 --> 06:13.629
is based on Detective Beckett,
maybe he's confusing the two.

06:13.663 --> 06:14.829
And we showed
Alex Peterman's family

06:14.975 --> 06:16.308
the sketch of our suspect.
He did not look familiar.

06:17.552 --> 06:18.819
How are we on forensics?

06:19.059 --> 06:20.626
C.S.U. grabbed
about 200 fingerprints,

06:20.660 --> 06:22.894
a thousand fibers
and 60 odd D.N.A. samples,

06:22.929 --> 06:25.363
and that was
just from the phone box.

06:25.397 --> 06:28.733
They're working them up now...
after they clear their backlog.

06:28.767 --> 06:32.568
Beckett. Guy on the phone's
asking for Detective heat.

06:39.493 --> 06:40.859
Beckett.

06:40.894 --> 06:44.629
Nikki, did you get
the first part of my message?

06:44.664 --> 06:46.497
Yes, I did.

06:46.532 --> 06:50.467
Well, the second is
at the Central Park carousel.

07:48.147 --> 07:50.847
<font color=#7FFF00>♪ Castle 2x17 ♪</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>Tick, Tick, Tick ...</font>

08:01.999 --> 08:03.766
Same M.O.

08:03.801 --> 08:06.369
She was shot 4 times with
a .45.

08:06.403 --> 08:09.071
There are contusions
on the victim's left side

08:09.105 --> 08:11.106
consistent with the muzzle
of a .45

08:11.140 --> 08:12.908
being jammed into her ribs.

08:12.942 --> 08:14.875
I'm guessing the killer
is left-handed.

08:14.910 --> 08:18.044
C.S.U. pulled the slugs
from the back of the carriage?

08:18.079 --> 08:20.046
Yes, there were letters
on the slugs.

08:20.080 --> 08:21.982
They spell "w-i-l-l."

08:22.016 --> 08:24.053
So he's sending a message.

08:24.088 --> 08:26.289
"Nikki will"...

08:26.324 --> 08:28.991
What? Nikki will what?

08:30.359 --> 08:34.126
Thank you, Lanie.
Mm-hmm.

08:34.160 --> 08:36.361
I guess it's official.
Our guy is a serial killer.

08:36.472 --> 08:37.707
I would think
that a serial killer

08:37.890 --> 08:40.158
would be like the holy grail
for a crime novelist.

08:40.226 --> 08:42.628
I guess it would be if it weren't
for the Nikki Heat of it all.
Ah.

08:43.162 --> 08:45.064
I'm feeling
a little bit responsible.

08:46.072 --> 08:48.273
Really? Like the Beatles
are responsible

08:48.307 --> 08:50.042
for Charles Manson
'cause of "Helter Skelter"?

08:50.076 --> 08:52.377
Or is it more like
Jodie Foster is responsible

08:52.411 --> 08:53.447
for John Hinckley
shooting Reagan?

08:53.457 --> 08:55.157
If I hadn't created
Nikki Heat--

08:55.435 --> 08:57.235
He would still be killing.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.105
He'd just find
another reason why.

08:59.115 --> 09:00.615
All right, folks.
Make way.

09:00.639 --> 09:02.807
Now what's going on?

09:02.841 --> 09:05.775
Either a U.F.O. just landed
on the other side of the park...

09:05.810 --> 09:09.511
or else the FBI is here to claim
jurisdiction over this case.

09:10.519 --> 09:12.055
Maybe they just want to ride
on the carousel

09:12.248 --> 09:14.749
before the line
gets too long.

09:14.783 --> 09:17.317
Rope off a 10-foot circumference
around the carousel.

09:17.352 --> 09:19.352
Sweep for prints
and trace evidence.

09:19.387 --> 09:21.654
Close off the park entrance
at 6th.

09:21.689 --> 09:24.723
Work up the entire footpath.
Mm-hmm.

09:24.757 --> 09:26.957
Here goes.
Nikki Heat I presume.

09:26.992 --> 09:29.226
It's Beckett.
Detective Kate Beckett.

09:29.261 --> 09:32.062
Yeah, I read all about you
in "Cosmo."

09:32.096 --> 09:34.898
And you must be the celebrity
writer tagalong, Richard Castle.

09:34.932 --> 09:37.867
Special Agent Jordan Shaw.
Jor-Jordan Shaw?

09:37.902 --> 09:40.602
The same Jordan Shaw
that broke

09:40.636 --> 09:43.169
the Hudson Valley Strangler Case
back in 1991?

09:43.203 --> 09:45.170
I also play
a mean game of scrabble.

09:45.205 --> 09:48.172
Now that we all know each other,
I'd like to see the body.

09:48.207 --> 09:51.141
Agent Shaw, my people have
already secured the area.

09:51.175 --> 09:53.982
C.S.U. is on the scene,
and we are canvassing the park.

09:54.016 --> 09:56.451
So as happy as I am
to see the cavalry,

09:56.485 --> 09:57.653
there's really not much left
here for you to do.

09:57.866 --> 09:59.833
Detective, the gods
in the Marble Halls

09:59.867 --> 10:01.768
have sent me here to catch
a killer, which I will do

10:01.778 --> 10:03.278
with or without your help, okay?

10:04.865 --> 10:08.167
Now could I see the body?
That is <i>so</i> going in the movie.

10:08.201 --> 10:10.070
Can you say that again,
but start from "Marble Halls"?

10:10.818 --> 10:13.520
Unis pulled this from
a trash bin. Wallet's inside.

10:13.555 --> 10:14.922
The vic's name
is Michelle Lewis.

10:14.932 --> 10:17.332
According to her business card,
she's a dog walker.

10:17.645 --> 10:20.812
There's a print here, and it's
too large to be our victim's.

10:20.847 --> 10:23.447
Let's get it to the lab for--

10:23.482 --> 10:25.650
What are you doing?

10:25.684 --> 10:27.886
That print is already in the lab
and being processed.

10:28.020 --> 10:30.023
No muss, no fuss,
no black powder on your clothes.

10:30.596 --> 10:32.799
Wow. There's an app for that?

10:32.809 --> 10:36.109
That's why I joined the FBI,
Mr. Castle, for the toys.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.571
I'm really eager
to see that body.

10:39.606 --> 10:42.674
Can I take a look
at that--

10:42.708 --> 10:45.276
Be a chance
to check it later.

10:49.638 --> 10:51.806
What is going on?

10:51.840 --> 10:54.740
They're setting up
the war room.

10:54.775 --> 10:57.309
War room?

10:57.343 --> 10:59.011
Tell me everything
you know about Jordan Shaw.

10:59.021 --> 11:00.221
She is like the federal you.

11:00.789 --> 11:03.089
She is good.
She is real good.

11:03.124 --> 11:05.158
She cracked open that
Hudson valley Strangler Case

11:05.191 --> 11:06.559
when she was just 25.

11:06.593 --> 11:08.797
I thought they caught him
off of a speeding ticket.

11:08.931 --> 11:12.001
Well, don't ask me how, but she
profiled that he drove a Yugo.

11:12.235 --> 11:13.737
They found a girl
tied up in the back.

11:13.747 --> 11:16.647
Uh-huh. Jordan Shaw
saved that girl's life.

11:16.919 --> 11:19.154
I've never seen you so excited
to meet anyone before.

11:19.189 --> 11:22.091
No, I just--I'm--
oh, I'm impressed with--
Excuse us.

11:22.457 --> 11:24.190
Watch it.
I...

11:24.224 --> 11:28.394
Can we go see
the war room now?

11:28.428 --> 11:31.095
You're running partials,
too, right?
Through all databases.

11:31.163 --> 11:33.964
The lab's getting us information
as fast as we can follow up.

11:34.258 --> 11:36.191
I thought there was
a backlog at the lab.

11:36.225 --> 11:39.094
I have a federal fast pass,
so I get to jump the line.

11:39.128 --> 11:41.630
Currently we a running
35 solid leads

11:41.664 --> 11:43.098
based on D.N.A., prints,

11:43.132 --> 11:44.999
trace evidence found
from both crime scenes,

11:45.033 --> 11:48.001
and we're running it through
the FBI data matrix.

11:48.035 --> 11:49.769
The matrix also looks
for a connection

11:49.804 --> 11:52.504
between the victims
in case the killer has a type

11:52.538 --> 11:55.606
or a favorite hunting ground
or isn't killing randomly.

11:55.640 --> 11:57.807
Both Alex Peterman
and Michelle Lewis belonged to

11:57.841 --> 12:00.676
the same Wessex gym, but they
went to different locations.

12:00.710 --> 12:02.678
They were both members
of moma.

12:02.712 --> 12:05.546
Hmm. They both adopted
their dogs

12:05.581 --> 12:07.081
from the same A.S.P.C.A.

12:07.115 --> 12:09.049
Sounds like it does
your job for you.

12:09.083 --> 12:10.984
A machine can collate.
It can't think.

12:11.018 --> 12:13.787
it takes a mind
to hunt a mind.

12:13.822 --> 12:15.756
Take this guy.
wow.

12:15.791 --> 12:19.360
He calls the police
to report his own crime,

12:19.394 --> 12:21.929
likes to kill
in heavily populated areas

12:21.963 --> 12:23.897
and uses bullets as messages.

12:23.932 --> 12:27.234
Now most of these stalker types
can barely tie their own shoes.

12:27.268 --> 12:29.603
This one's different, smarter.

12:29.637 --> 12:32.473
You almost sound like
you admire him.

12:32.507 --> 12:36.276
I admire him the way Robert Shaw
admired the shark in "Jaws."

12:36.310 --> 12:37.877
The better I know him,

12:37.911 --> 12:40.547
the easier it'll be to catch him.
That's like when I'm writing.

12:40.582 --> 12:42.649
The killer's voice
doesn't sound authentic

12:42.684 --> 12:44.853
unless I understand
his motivation.

12:44.863 --> 12:46.363
Well, this guy
likes to make a scene.

12:46.487 --> 12:49.055
I wouldn't be surprised
if he was also an arsonist.

12:49.056 --> 12:51.024
In fact, I think
that's what drew him

12:51.058 --> 12:53.760
to the Nikki Heat character
in the first place--her name.

12:53.794 --> 12:56.563
Speaking of Detective Heat...
Oh.

12:56.597 --> 12:58.164
Whoa. Whoa. Guys. Listen.

12:58.199 --> 13:00.834
Not that I don't appreciate
the royalties, but, uh,

13:00.868 --> 13:02.171
why do you need
a hundred copies of "Heat Wave"?

13:02.379 --> 13:05.448
If our killer is obsessed with
Nikki Heat, then so are we.

13:05.482 --> 13:06.916
Avery, Cliff notes, please.

13:08.982 --> 13:10.916
A real estate tycoon
is killed.

13:10.950 --> 13:13.184
Detective Nikki Heat
catches the case

13:13.219 --> 13:16.488
and investigates suspects
who wanted the man dead.

13:16.522 --> 13:18.856
There's a trophy wife,
of course,

13:18.891 --> 13:20.858
dangerous mobsters---
uh, uh, excuse me.

13:20.893 --> 13:23.361
It's--it's a--it's
a "New York Times" best-seller.

13:23.395 --> 13:26.364
I don't think there's a need
to make it sound quite so dry.

13:26.398 --> 13:27.765
Thanks.

13:27.799 --> 13:30.934
Heat's life is complicated by
a reporter named Jameson Rook,

13:30.968 --> 13:33.937
who's following her around
for an article he's writing.

13:34.004 --> 13:37.506
Heat and Rook verbally spar,
and in chapter 11,

13:37.541 --> 13:40.678
admit their attraction
for one another and have sex.

13:43.178 --> 13:45.646
Mm-hmm.

13:46.523 --> 13:48.224
It's fiction.

13:49.827 --> 13:52.529
In the end,
when the killer's revealed,

13:52.563 --> 13:54.998
it turns out it's actually--

13:55.032 --> 13:57.934
Oh, oh, oh.
Spoiler alert.

13:57.968 --> 14:01.304
In deference to Mr. Castle's
artistic sensitivity,

14:01.338 --> 14:03.907
you can all read the book
to find out the identity

14:03.941 --> 14:05.942
of the killer.
Thank you.

14:05.976 --> 14:08.677
And if you want me
to autograph those for you,

14:08.712 --> 14:11.046
just form a single file line
right here.

14:11.080 --> 14:13.815
Or not.

14:13.850 --> 14:16.687
We got a hit. That pinkie print
off the second victim's purse

14:16.721 --> 14:19.290
belongs to a Donald Salt,
2-time loser,

14:19.324 --> 14:22.561
on parole for a manslaughter
conviction in 2005.

14:22.595 --> 14:25.364
They just matched it
to the partial pinkie print

14:25.399 --> 14:28.067
your team recovered from Grand Central.
Two pinkie prints?

14:28.166 --> 14:30.467
So he was at the station
and the carousel.

14:30.501 --> 14:32.736
And the purse puts him
with our victim.

14:32.770 --> 14:35.438
Let's mount up.

14:39.639 --> 14:43.574
Yeah. Okay.
Just pulling up now.

14:43.608 --> 14:46.742
Yep, got it.

14:46.777 --> 14:49.344
Salt lives
in that brick building.

14:49.378 --> 14:50.879
His supervisor says
he left work an hour ago.

14:51.233 --> 14:52.101
So he should be home
by now.

14:52.195 --> 14:54.261
When the others get here,
we'll take him.

14:54.295 --> 14:56.997
What is he doing?
He, um, touches things.

14:58.619 --> 15:02.722
Night vision goggles. I think
I have the newer model, though.

15:02.756 --> 15:04.557
You know,
maybe in my third book,

15:04.591 --> 15:06.192
Nikki Heat will cross swords

15:06.226 --> 15:09.895
with a good-looking,
yet coldhearted FBI profiler.

15:09.929 --> 15:12.730
Call it "Federal Heat."

15:12.765 --> 15:14.465
Or maybe not.

15:19.320 --> 15:21.122
So howi'm... We're-- two been
we're not sleeping together.

15:21.310 --> 15:22.711
Um...-

15:22.721 --> 15:24.421
We're- we're not sleeping together

15:24.721 --> 15:26.741
We--he--
he just observes me.

15:26.742 --> 15:28.772
<i>Yeah.</i> I've seen
how he observes you.

15:28.807 --> 15:31.808
no, she's right.
Aside from my second wife,

15:31.843 --> 15:33.239
This is the most sexless
relationship I've ever been in.

15:33.463 --> 15:35.259
I've been profiling people for a long time.

15:35.295 --> 15:36.362
I'm hardly ever wrong.

15:36.872 --> 15:39.172
Well, this time you are...
Wrong.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.082
So if you're not
sleeping together,

15:42.126 --> 15:44.061
Why do you keep him around?

15:44.095 --> 15:46.696
You know I can hear you?

15:46.730 --> 15:49.265
He's actually proven
to be surprisingly helpful.

15:49.299 --> 15:51.834
Hmm. Have to take
your word on that.

15:54.070 --> 15:56.571
Put the taser <i>down.</i>

16:01.008 --> 16:03.075
Okay, the team's here.

16:03.110 --> 16:04.943
You stay in the car.

16:04.978 --> 16:08.614
You heard her, Castle.
Stay.

16:08.648 --> 16:11.584
Could you at least
crack the window for me?

16:14.254 --> 16:17.189
Come on. Let's go.
Move, move.

16:17.224 --> 16:20.860
Let's make it quick
and bloodless.

16:23.831 --> 16:26.566
Go, go, go, go.

16:28.235 --> 16:30.670
Hang on.

16:30.737 --> 16:33.038
Stop! FBI!
Hey!

16:37.910 --> 16:39.111
Aah!

16:39.145 --> 16:41.779
Aah! Oh!

16:41.814 --> 16:42.814
Oh!

16:42.848 --> 16:45.383
Ohh! Oh!

16:45.417 --> 16:46.851
Oh!

16:46.886 --> 16:48.321
See, I'm helping.

16:48.354 --> 16:50.156
Yeah. I'll buy you
an ice cream later.

16:50.378 --> 16:53.013
Agent Shaw,
we got a problem.

16:53.048 --> 16:55.015
His pinkie finger's missing.

16:56.517 --> 17:00.050
Which one of you
is Nikki Heat?

17:03.728 --> 17:05.994
So I was on one of those
internet barter sites,

17:06.029 --> 17:08.163
And I was looking--

17:08.196 --> 17:10.130
It, uh, doesn't matter
what I was looking for.

17:10.164 --> 17:12.665
But I came across the ad.

17:12.700 --> 17:14.367
"finger wanted.
Will pay top dollar."

17:14.401 --> 17:16.536
And what's top dollar
for a pinkie finger?

17:17.561 --> 17:19.863
5,000 bucks.

17:19.897 --> 17:21.432
Sounds like a real deal.

17:21.665 --> 17:23.334
Hey, you get less than that
for a kidney.

17:23.867 --> 17:25.301
So anyway,
I e-mailed him back.

17:25.336 --> 17:26.903
I told him I had
everything he wanted.

17:26.926 --> 17:30.061
You gave him the finger.
What more did he want?

17:30.195 --> 17:33.229
He wanted me to have
a violent felony conviction

17:34.130 --> 17:36.030
and to be recently paroled.

17:36.065 --> 17:38.500
And you also had to be
willing to suffer through

17:38.534 --> 17:40.335
the indignity
of a false arrest.

17:40.370 --> 17:44.840
He told me Detective Nikki Heat
would be coming for me...

17:44.874 --> 17:47.876
and it might get physical.

17:47.910 --> 17:50.345
He didn't mention anything
about Captain America

17:50.379 --> 17:51.746
with the taser gun.

17:51.780 --> 17:53.180
So he warned you

17:53.215 --> 17:55.916
that he would be planting
your print at a murder scene.

17:55.950 --> 17:57.917
Which is why you have
an alibi.

17:57.952 --> 17:59.919
Was perched on
my favorite bar stool

17:59.954 --> 18:01.987
at McSorley's
until closing every night

18:02.022 --> 18:04.223
since that man took my digit
and walked away with it

18:04.462 --> 18:06.796
in his cooler.
Is this the man?

18:06.831 --> 18:09.164
I'm not sure.
I didn't really see him.

18:09.199 --> 18:11.900
He had a hat and sunglasses.
Who bandaged your finger?

18:11.935 --> 18:13.367
He did.

18:13.402 --> 18:16.773
He said you'd notice.

18:18.308 --> 18:21.309
Ooh,e gentle with me,Nikki.

18:29.917 --> 18:32.018
There's numbers here.

18:35.388 --> 18:37.122
This looks like a code.

18:38.263 --> 18:39.631
Severed digits,

18:39.814 --> 18:42.315
A secret code--this is like
one of my books.

18:42.316 --> 18:44.617
You should've been with me
on the recapitator case.

18:44.651 --> 18:46.952
What, that guy in Phoenix who
switched his victims' heads?

18:46.953 --> 18:47.989
That was your case?

18:48.799 --> 18:49.899
Our techs
have run the numbers

18:50.021 --> 18:52.856
through all conventional
cryptology. We can't crack it.

18:52.890 --> 18:55.724
Which means what?
There's either a reference key
that we don't have

18:55.759 --> 18:58.827
or the code itself is just
a random string of numbers.
It's not random.

18:58.861 --> 19:00.963
He bought another man's finger
so he could leave a print

19:01.186 --> 19:02.453
that would lead us
directly to this code.

19:02.660 --> 19:03.794
It's how he taunts Nikki.

19:03.980 --> 19:05.981
"are you clever enough
to solve my riddle?"

19:06.015 --> 19:07.882
So whatever
this reference key is,

19:07.916 --> 19:09.252
he thinks you can find it.

19:09.262 --> 19:10.962
Those numbers
could mean anything.

19:11.418 --> 19:13.586
Well, the left-hand
column is less than 300.

19:13.621 --> 19:15.554
Right-hand column
is no more than 260.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.556
And the combination
of the joined pair

19:17.590 --> 19:20.325
Most likely yields a word.
Words.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.160
It's "Heat Wave."

19:22.194 --> 19:26.497
When we typeset a manuscript,
it's usually 300 words a page.

19:26.531 --> 19:28.966
And "Heat Wave"
is less than 300 pages.

19:30.506 --> 19:32.275
First column
is a page number...

19:32.309 --> 19:33.809
Counting backwards
from the bottom.

19:33.865 --> 19:36.800
79. Second column
is a word.

19:36.835 --> 19:39.069
32, 33. "I."
126--80, "will."

19:39.104 --> 19:41.473
145--204, "kill."

19:41.507 --> 19:42.907
"I will kill"...

19:42.941 --> 19:45.709
Hang on. I'm uploading
the text right now.

19:47.713 --> 19:49.280
"I will kill

19:49.314 --> 19:51.416
"someone else before

19:51.451 --> 19:54.887
"midnight tonight
unless you stop me."

19:57.491 --> 19:59.890
Midnight.
That's eight hours away.

19:59.924 --> 20:03.091
He's putting us on the clock.
He's daring us to stop him.

20:09.596 --> 20:11.197
Kickin' it old-school?

20:11.231 --> 20:13.232
The white board's
always worked for me.

20:14.686 --> 20:15.986
I've been going over
subway routes,

20:16.314 --> 20:18.048
trying to see
if I can trace a pattern

20:18.211 --> 20:20.177
from Grand Central
to the carousel

20:20.211 --> 20:22.779
to the next location,
and so far, nothing definitive.

20:22.813 --> 20:24.547
Well, maybe there's something

20:24.581 --> 20:26.782
about how he chooses
his victims.

20:26.816 --> 20:28.951
First a man, then a woman.
A lawyer and a dog walker?

20:28.985 --> 20:30.685
Let's face it.
There's no pattern there.

20:30.720 --> 20:33.689
There's no way to predict
where he's gonna go next,

20:33.723 --> 20:37.059
And it's already 9:00,
and we're out of time.

20:37.093 --> 20:41.665
And every murder he commits
in the name of Nikki Heat...

20:42.912 --> 20:44.480
A very wise woman
once told me,

20:44.603 --> 20:46.716
you can't blame Jodie Foster
for John Hinckley.

20:48.838 --> 20:51.575
But you can blame her
for "Nim's Island."

20:53.378 --> 20:56.446
Llead just came in now.
Let's get it to Avery.

20:59.250 --> 21:00.350
What have you got?

21:00.460 --> 21:02.060
Lab results came back
on that bandage.

21:02.085 --> 21:03.386
Tested positive
for formaldehyde,

21:03.420 --> 21:05.054
methanol and ethanol.

21:05.189 --> 21:06.658
Embalming fluid.
Embalming fluid.

21:07.760 --> 21:10.229
The lab found traces of
formaldehyde at Grand Central

21:10.263 --> 21:12.433
and ethanol at the carousel.

21:12.443 --> 21:14.243
Our killer
works at a mortuary.

21:15.008 --> 21:16.875
Or he could be
a hospital employee

21:16.910 --> 21:17.678
or a janitor at a morgue.

21:17.802 --> 21:19.837
No. Castle's theory
is more likely.

21:19.871 --> 21:21.639
Bring up all the mortuaries
in the city.

21:21.673 --> 21:24.474
We've got over a thousand
in the New York City area alone.

21:24.509 --> 21:25.375
We can't hit all these
before midnight.

21:25.385 --> 21:27.485
Can you cross-reference
mortuary experience

21:27.509 --> 21:30.109
with criminal records?
Or job finder groups for ex-cons.

21:30.143 --> 21:32.611
Yes!
I can try.

21:34.559 --> 21:35.393
Six names.

21:35.534 --> 21:37.635
Mobilize the troops.
I want every one of these guys

21:37.669 --> 21:39.536
in our custody
before midnight.

21:39.570 --> 21:43.740
I see what you mean
about him being helpful.

21:45.809 --> 21:49.411
Any of these undertakers
look good for it?

21:49.445 --> 21:52.380
They all say the same thing,
"we work with dead bodies

21:52.414 --> 21:54.381
all day,
we don't need to make more."

21:54.415 --> 21:56.483
He baited us, just like
with that fingerprint.

21:56.517 --> 21:58.451
We're wasting our time.

21:58.486 --> 22:01.520
He's on the phone.
He's asking for Nikki Heat.

22:01.555 --> 22:04.190
We're tracing the call.

22:05.725 --> 22:07.359
Hello.

22:07.393 --> 22:08.527
Nikki?

22:08.561 --> 22:10.962
You were supposed to stop me.

22:10.996 --> 22:13.298
I wanted you to stop me.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.300
Tell me where you are.

22:16.215 --> 22:19.050
Will you come alone?

22:19.718 --> 22:21.352
Yes, just you and me.

22:21.420 --> 22:24.322
We can figure this out.

22:25.375 --> 22:27.644
I can help you.
You just need to trust me.

22:29.110 --> 22:32.645
Tell me something...

22:32.679 --> 22:37.116
how does it feel
to know that you have failed?

22:51.752 --> 22:54.189
Check the stairs.
Get a unit on the roof.

22:54.227 --> 22:55.996
I want eyes on every inch
of this structure.

22:56.128 --> 22:58.596
He was just here.
That body can't be too far.

22:58.631 --> 23:00.932
Over here!
A lot of blood.

23:00.967 --> 23:03.001
A woman's shoe.

23:03.035 --> 23:04.435
Got a broken heel.

23:04.468 --> 23:07.436
Strands of hair.
Looks like she put up a fight.

23:07.470 --> 23:08.836
There's four shell casings.

23:08.870 --> 23:11.305
There's no way
she would've survived

23:11.339 --> 23:13.740
without medical attention.
Then where's the body?

23:13.774 --> 23:15.709
He always leaves the body
where he kills.

23:15.743 --> 23:17.444
And he always kills
in famous places

23:17.478 --> 23:18.880
with lots of foot traffic.

23:19.913 --> 23:20.847
He's changing his M.O.

23:21.064 --> 23:21.998
which makes him
more unpredictable,

23:22.178 --> 23:23.179
which makes him
more dangerous.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.561
Structure's clear.
There's no body.

23:27.096 --> 23:28.930
Where the hell
did he put her?

23:28.965 --> 23:30.365
He put her in his trunk.

23:31.600 --> 23:32.602
That blood trail ends
right here.

23:34.709 --> 23:37.344
So he waited,
probably left his car idling,

23:37.379 --> 23:39.680
takes down his victim,
popped his trunk, put her in,

23:39.715 --> 23:42.450
drove away, body on board.
Get the parking attendant

23:42.484 --> 23:44.519
to give us a list
of all the vehicles through here

23:44.553 --> 23:46.220
and the video footage.
Mm-hmm.

23:46.255 --> 23:47.254
You think
he used his own car?

23:47.264 --> 23:49.087
No, but if he
stole it tonight,

23:49.088 --> 23:50.788
he might not have had time
to switch the plates.

23:50.912 --> 23:52.912
We put out an A.P.B.
I'll get my guys to get a roster

23:53.047 --> 23:54.514
Of all the people who had
monthlies on this floor.

23:54.524 --> 23:55.724
My people are already on it.

23:55.912 --> 23:57.380
I got way more people
than you do.

23:57.667 --> 23:59.302
Your captain has a unit
on your apartment.

23:59.336 --> 24:00.737
Go home. Get some rest.
It's not necess--

24:00.920 --> 24:04.622
No argument. You're no good
to me if you're burned out.

24:17.962 --> 24:20.830
<i>He roars</i>
<i>like an angry, caged animal.</i>

24:20.898 --> 24:23.466
<i>He's heading towards</i>
<i>the outer hatch area.</i>

24:23.500 --> 24:25.802
<i>The blows don't seem to be</i>
<i>injuring his hands.</i>

24:25.836 --> 24:27.837
<i>There's no--there's no blood</i>
<i>that I can see.</i>

24:27.872 --> 24:29.506
Hey.

24:29.540 --> 24:31.541
Hi.
What are you still doing up?

24:31.575 --> 24:33.642
Oh, can't sleep.
Too much on my mind.

24:33.677 --> 24:37.045
You know,
decisions to make and...

24:37.079 --> 24:39.080
Wow. One of
your old wedding videos.

24:39.114 --> 24:41.648
Oh-ho-ho.
Are you kidding?

24:41.683 --> 24:44.084
This guy's a pushover
compared to my ex-husbands.

24:44.118 --> 24:46.620
So the pros
outweighed the cons?

24:46.654 --> 24:49.456
Darling, this was always
supposed to be

24:49.491 --> 24:52.860
a temporary situation--un-until
I got back on my feet, you know.

24:52.894 --> 24:55.696
Well, the Rodgers women
always follow their hearts.

24:55.730 --> 24:58.165
Yeah.

24:58.199 --> 24:59.799
You okay?

25:01.049 --> 25:02.651
This case, it just...

25:03.949 --> 25:04.816
If it wasn't for my book--

25:05.008 --> 25:05.908
What are you gonna do,
darling,

25:06.141 --> 25:09.009
stop writing because some idiot
has got a screw loose?

25:09.043 --> 25:10.844
No, it's just...

25:12.352 --> 25:14.454
I never intended
to put her in harm's way.

25:14.588 --> 25:16.555
Let me tell you something
about Kate Beckett.

25:16.590 --> 25:19.258
That gal can take care
of herself.

25:19.293 --> 25:21.127
Really.

25:53.995 --> 25:54.929
Whoo! Wow!

25:55.076 --> 25:58.010
Castle?
What are you doing here?

25:59.484 --> 26:00.684
Wine?

26:00.718 --> 26:02.718
So what happened
to your security detail?

26:03.253 --> 26:04.786
I didn't see anyone outside.

26:04.820 --> 26:08.053
I sent them home
after I got in.

26:08.088 --> 26:09.786
What?

26:09.820 --> 26:11.953
The windows are locked,
the door is locked,

26:11.987 --> 26:13.887
I'm armed.

26:13.921 --> 26:16.659
So our guy killed the others
where they were found.

26:18.183 --> 26:19.617
Why not this girl?

26:19.651 --> 26:20.887
Why didn't he just leave her
in the garage

26:20.921 --> 26:22.054
where we'd find her?

26:22.306 --> 26:23.739
He's changing it up.

26:23.773 --> 26:26.009
Or this victim is special.
Oh, no, thanks.

26:27.753 --> 26:30.757
No, no, Agent Shaw said
we need to decompress.

26:30.791 --> 26:34.661
Nothing decompresses like
a 2000 Châteauneuf-du-pape.

26:34.695 --> 26:37.363
Oh, well, if special agent Shaw
said so...

26:37.397 --> 26:38.366
What is that supposed to mean?

26:38.376 --> 26:41.876
Nothing. I just see the way
that you listen to her,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.667
the way that you look
at all of her fancy equipment.

26:44.702 --> 26:46.736
Now my murder board's
not enough for you?

26:46.770 --> 26:48.470
Now you need a smart board?

26:48.504 --> 26:51.138
Are you jealous?
I'm not jealous. I'm just embarrassed...

26:51.362 --> 26:52.729
the way that you act like
a 10 year old,

26:52.940 --> 26:54.841
all impressed
by her data matrix.

26:55.072 --> 26:57.539
"oh, it collates information
so quickly, Agent Shaw.

26:57.574 --> 26:59.908
Tell me all about it."
You are ridiculous.

26:59.942 --> 27:02.611
And then to top it off, you are
now building theory with her.
So?

27:02.645 --> 27:05.181
So you're supposed to be
building theory with me.

27:05.215 --> 27:07.218
You're supposed to be
on my team.

27:07.228 --> 27:08.728
Well, I thought we were all
on the same team?

27:08.930 --> 27:11.898
We are. It's just... I think
that if you have an insight,

27:11.933 --> 27:14.667
you should
run it by me first.

27:14.701 --> 27:16.568
Fine. I will.
Now drink your wine.

27:16.602 --> 27:18.069
Thanks.

27:18.830 --> 27:21.197
But I am tired.

27:21.232 --> 27:23.933
And... I need to go to bed.

27:23.967 --> 27:26.202
Oh, no. I'm not leaving.

27:26.236 --> 27:28.636
I'm here to protect you.

27:28.671 --> 27:31.106
What, with your vast arsenal
of rapier wit?

27:31.996 --> 27:34.498
There is a madman
gunning for you because of me.

27:34.796 --> 27:37.330
I am not
going to leave you alone.

27:37.365 --> 27:40.533
Okay, fine.
I am too tired to argue.

27:40.567 --> 27:42.868
But if I see
that doorknob turn,

27:42.902 --> 27:44.436
I will have you know,

27:44.470 --> 27:47.708
Mr. Castle, that I sleep with a gun.
Understood.

28:14.872 --> 28:17.774
You're still here...
And you're making pancakes?

28:17.808 --> 28:21.109
I was hoping for bacon and eggs,
but your eggs are expired

28:21.144 --> 28:22.979
and your bacon
has something furry on it.

28:22.989 --> 28:24.789
Yeah, well,
I mostly order in.

28:24.914 --> 28:25.981
I figured that
from the styrofoam temple

28:26.094 --> 28:27.429
you've got going on
in that refrigerator.

28:27.585 --> 28:29.586
Coffee's brewed. I think
your filter's broken though.

28:29.620 --> 28:31.189
I'll order you
a new one later.

28:31.199 --> 28:33.699
Wow. Looks like
you thought of everything.

28:33.723 --> 28:35.190
Except the paper.

28:35.874 --> 28:37.809
Castle, we don't have time
for the paper.

28:37.843 --> 28:40.778
There's a body out there
that I gotta find.
Woah!

28:42.213 --> 28:45.181
Looks like it found you.

28:53.382 --> 28:55.350
So you had
just gotten up, right?

28:55.538 --> 28:57.538
Yeah. Castle just finished
making breakfast,

28:57.573 --> 28:59.907
and he went to the door--
What kind of breakfast?

28:59.941 --> 29:01.674
Uh, I'm sorry?

29:01.709 --> 29:04.209
What kind of breakfast
was he making?

29:04.244 --> 29:06.044
Pancakes.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.978
Well, isn't that domestic?

29:08.013 --> 29:09.313
<i>Anyway,</i>

29:09.347 --> 29:12.382
the paper usually arrives
at 4:00, and we were up at 7:00.

29:12.536 --> 29:13.937
So that means the killer had
a 3-hour window

29:14.133 --> 29:15.568
where he could've left
the body there unnoticed.

29:15.578 --> 29:16.598
And exactly what time

29:16.694 --> 29:18.562
did you and Mr. Castle
go to bed last night?

29:20.345 --> 29:22.080
I think we're done here.

29:22.114 --> 29:24.515
Dude, I see
Beckett in her jammies...

29:24.550 --> 29:26.884
Wine glasses on the table.

29:26.918 --> 29:30.020
There's nothing going on
with Beckett and me.

29:30.055 --> 29:33.491
No more than there was yesterday.
Dude, you made her pancakes?

29:33.525 --> 29:36.593
It's just breakfast.
Pancakes is not just breakfast.

29:36.628 --> 29:38.962
It's an edible way
of saying,

29:38.996 --> 29:41.030
"thank you so much
for last night."

29:41.064 --> 29:43.532
Castle, come on.
We're your friends. Details.

29:45.001 --> 29:47.068
All right. Come here.

29:49.138 --> 29:51.673
There are no details.

29:51.708 --> 29:54.676
I can't even look at you
right now.

29:54.710 --> 29:57.010
Witness refuses
to cooperate.

29:59.999 --> 30:01.300
Now we know
why he took the body.

30:01.669 --> 30:04.971
"I know where you live."
this was a threat.

30:05.306 --> 30:07.373
More than that.

30:08.493 --> 30:10.261
He's saying
he's disappointed in you.

30:10.441 --> 30:11.108
In his mind,

30:11.168 --> 30:13.635
he gave you fair warning that
he was going to kill again.

30:13.669 --> 30:16.570
If you had been smarter, you
would've been able to stop him.

30:16.604 --> 30:20.439
He's saying,
"this one is on you."

30:20.474 --> 30:23.643
I'm profiling him, Detective,
not agreeing with him.

30:23.677 --> 30:25.712
The guy
is a friggin' nut bar.

30:25.746 --> 30:27.514
Don't let him get to you.

30:27.548 --> 30:29.783
Talk about irony.

30:30.876 --> 30:32.745
Do we have an I.D. on our vic?
No, not yet.

30:32.929 --> 30:35.898
There's no purse, no missing
person's report filed.

30:35.932 --> 30:37.332
The coroner's van's
downstairs.

30:37.367 --> 30:39.368
We need to get the body to
the morgue and pull the slugs.

30:39.522 --> 30:40.989
Only four entry wounds.

30:41.024 --> 30:42.457
If the pattern holds,

30:42.492 --> 30:44.292
he should have a 4-letter word.

30:44.327 --> 30:47.229
That's sunny. I have
a 4-letter word for him, too.

30:47.263 --> 30:50.232
Why don't you two escort
the body to the morgue

30:50.266 --> 30:52.300
and let me know what you find?
Okay.

30:52.335 --> 30:54.836
Once you're dressed,
of course.

31:01.010 --> 31:03.877
Hey. Heard you two
were making pancakes

31:04.093 --> 31:05.594
when the body dropped.

31:05.628 --> 31:08.264
Nothing happened.
<i>Right.</i>

31:08.298 --> 31:10.099
So what do you got?

31:10.133 --> 31:11.634
Letters on the slugs.

31:11.668 --> 31:13.736
"b-u-r--"

31:13.770 --> 31:16.438
"burn." Nikki will burn.
Well, that's chilling.

31:16.660 --> 31:19.195
Our victim's fingerprints
aren't in the system.

31:19.229 --> 31:21.130
Do you have anything
that can I.D. her?

31:21.164 --> 31:23.100
Well, I found formaldehyde on her.
Yeah, that's from the killer.

31:23.259 --> 31:24.526
He left it
at the other scenes as well.

31:24.748 --> 31:27.583
Not traces. It was under
her fingernails, in her hair.

31:27.617 --> 31:29.585
She worked
with embalming fluid.

31:29.620 --> 31:33.122
I also found traces of clay,
polyurethane and animal blood.

31:33.156 --> 31:35.725
I don't know who she is, but I
can tell you what she does.

31:35.759 --> 31:37.329
She's a taxidermist.

31:37.339 --> 31:40.139
It's so cute,
the way you two do that.

31:42.893 --> 31:45.896
Taxidermy?
Embalming fluid plus animal hair

31:45.930 --> 31:47.330
equals Norman Bates'
favorite pastime.

31:47.398 --> 31:50.300
It can't be just a coincidence
that we found embalming fluid

31:50.334 --> 31:53.502
at our first two crime scenes
as well.

31:53.537 --> 31:57.539
So the killer and this victim
were connected.

31:57.574 --> 31:59.208
It seems so.

31:59.242 --> 32:01.210
So there's only seven
taxidermy shops in the city.

32:01.244 --> 32:02.611
My guys are running them down
right now.

32:02.772 --> 32:04.639
But if there was a connection
between them,

32:04.673 --> 32:05.608
why didn't comparison matrix
find it?

32:05.618 --> 32:07.918
Maybe it's not as simple
as a work relationship

32:08.143 --> 32:10.010
or going to the same gym.

32:10.044 --> 32:13.914
Like you said, it takes a mind
to hunt a mind.
Yo.

32:13.948 --> 32:15.783
We got an I.D.
on our third vic.

32:15.817 --> 32:17.651
Her name is Sandra Keller.

32:17.685 --> 32:19.787
She works
at a taxidermy shop downtown.

32:19.821 --> 32:22.289
Any connection
between her and our killer?

32:22.324 --> 32:24.425
A colleague of hers said
she had a run-in with a guy

32:24.459 --> 32:27.128
who maybe matched our sketch--
a customer whose Bichon Frise

32:27.163 --> 32:29.432
had been killed in the park
by another dog--a Rottweiler.

32:29.442 --> 32:30.542
Customer was heartbroken.

32:30.780 --> 32:32.948
He paid half up front
to have his Mr. Bumpkins

32:32.983 --> 32:34.484
preserved for eternity.

32:34.518 --> 32:36.587
When he came back to pick up
his dog, didn't have the fee.

32:36.722 --> 32:38.423
When Sandra refused
to give up stuffed Bumpkins,

32:38.657 --> 32:41.457
the guy went ballistic
and stormed out of the store.

32:41.491 --> 32:43.125
Two nights later,
they had a break-in.

32:43.159 --> 32:45.290
Among the things that
went missing are this guy's

32:45.324 --> 32:47.992
stuffed Bichon Frise
and a bunch of embalming fluid.

32:48.002 --> 32:50.302
That explains why we found traces
of it at the murder scenes.

32:50.448 --> 32:52.349
He also trashed
the store's computer.

32:52.458 --> 32:56.161
There's no client data, no name.
My agents interviewed

32:56.195 --> 32:59.197
all of Michelle Lewis'
dog walking clients.

32:59.231 --> 33:02.032
One couple had to put
their Rottweiler down because

33:02.066 --> 33:05.034
Michelle lost control of it,
and it killed another dog.
Mr. Bumpkins.

33:05.068 --> 33:08.470
So grief-stricken, our killer
blames Michelle and Sandra

33:08.504 --> 33:11.673
for the loss of his best friend
and decides to get revenge.

33:11.707 --> 33:13.174
All of this about a dog?

33:13.208 --> 33:16.243
What does this have to do
with Nikki Heat?
The dog's the trigger.

33:16.278 --> 33:17.913
Maybe he was reading the book
when it was killed.

33:18.093 --> 33:19.961
When he snapped, he somehow
blamed Nikki for it.

33:20.971 --> 33:22.371
It seems a little absurd.

33:22.753 --> 33:23.921
You must be a cat lover.

33:24.080 --> 33:26.548
Detective, he's looking for
a reason to kill. This is it.

33:27.258 --> 33:28.458
What about our first vic?

33:28.851 --> 33:30.086
How does Peterman
fit in to all this?

33:30.096 --> 33:31.996
Well, he was
a personal injury lawyer.

33:32.225 --> 33:34.160
Maybe our murderer
wanted to file

33:34.194 --> 33:35.830
a wrongful doggy death suit.

33:35.840 --> 33:37.140
According to Peterman's notes,

33:37.355 --> 33:40.890
back in January, he had
a meeting with a Ben Conrad

33:40.925 --> 33:42.824
over a lawsuit
about a dead dog.

33:42.859 --> 33:44.492
Peterman declined to take
the case though.

33:44.502 --> 33:46.102
That's the last piece
of our puzzle.

33:46.376 --> 33:49.277
What do you have on Conrad?

33:49.312 --> 33:52.346
Just a photo from the D.M.V.

34:00.487 --> 34:04.390
Got you,
you son of a bitch.

34:09.556 --> 34:12.158
Yeah.

34:12.192 --> 34:13.426
Okay.

34:13.460 --> 34:14.494
Okay, sweetie.

34:14.688 --> 34:16.623
Mommy's gotta go
arrest somebody, okay?

34:16.657 --> 34:19.625
I'll be home for dinner.
All right. I love you.

34:19.659 --> 34:20.760
Bye.

34:20.793 --> 34:23.228
You're a mom?
Yeah.

34:23.263 --> 34:26.699
And you can holster your gun.
You're both staying here.
What? No, come no.

34:26.733 --> 34:29.168
This is the final takedown.
You can't let her do this to us.

34:29.333 --> 34:32.335
No, Agent Shaw is right.
I'm his target.

34:32.956 --> 34:34.356
I can't compromise your team

34:34.391 --> 34:35.359
by walking into the line of fire.

34:35.507 --> 34:38.009
We'll take him down.
It'll still be your collar.
Mm-hmm.

34:40.472 --> 34:43.273
Wow. She's a mom. I never
would've pegged her for that.

34:43.306 --> 34:45.574
I figured she was
a career-driven woman

34:45.609 --> 34:48.110
with no time for a family.
Well, not everybody makes that choice.

34:48.143 --> 34:51.513
Beckett.
He's calling for you.

34:51.547 --> 34:53.850
Put him on.

34:53.884 --> 34:55.118
Hello.

34:55.152 --> 34:58.560
Oh, you think you're so smart,
don't you, Nikki?

34:58.594 --> 35:04.730
You think, what, just because
you found me that you won?

35:04.764 --> 35:06.531
He knows we're here.

35:06.566 --> 35:10.601
It's over, Ben.
Time to give up.

35:10.636 --> 35:14.541
No, it is <i>not</i> over!

35:15.958 --> 35:17.191
Ben, listen to me.
You're surrounded.

35:17.324 --> 35:18.792
I need you
to put the gun down.

35:19.727 --> 35:23.497
You know
I can't do that, Nikki.

35:23.531 --> 35:26.766
Ben, I need you to step outside
of your apartment

35:26.801 --> 35:29.268
with your hands raised.

35:29.303 --> 35:32.271
That's not our game.
One of us has to die.

35:32.305 --> 35:36.074
No one has to die.
Somebody always has to die!

35:40.478 --> 35:44.347
And since it can't be you...

35:44.381 --> 35:47.049
Ben.

35:48.184 --> 35:49.918
Go!

35:49.953 --> 35:52.589
Go! Go! Go!

35:52.623 --> 35:54.459
Kitchen's clear!

35:54.494 --> 35:57.029
Bathroom's clear!

36:01.167 --> 36:03.201
We're sending
the gun to ballistics,

36:03.236 --> 36:05.170
but given it's a .45,
it's probably the same one

36:05.204 --> 36:06.972
he used on our other victims.

36:06.982 --> 36:09.082
And probably the same one
he was gonna use on you.

36:09.326 --> 36:11.027
Uh, actually, no.

36:11.062 --> 36:14.664
He was planning something
a little bit more spectacular.

36:14.699 --> 36:16.733
Cell phones?

36:16.767 --> 36:20.804
He was making
a detonator.

36:23.241 --> 36:26.343
<i>Good-bye, Nikki.</i>
<i>Good-bye, Nikki.</i>

36:26.377 --> 36:28.978
He was extracting formaldehyde

36:29.013 --> 36:32.015
from the embalming fluid
he stole to create cyclonite--

36:32.049 --> 36:33.983
A near
military-grade explosive.

36:34.018 --> 36:36.719
When you profiled him, you said
he was probably an arsonist.

36:36.753 --> 36:39.320
I also said
he liked to make a big scene.

36:39.355 --> 36:41.323
Schematics of the precinct.

36:41.357 --> 36:42.358
He was planning on killing you

36:42.549 --> 36:44.583
and taking
the whole station with you.

36:44.618 --> 36:47.786
"Nikki will burn."
I can see the poetry in that.

36:47.820 --> 36:51.056
The terrible,
homicidal poetry.

36:52.410 --> 36:56.112
I just wouldn't have profiled
this guy as suicidal.

36:56.147 --> 36:58.048
I guess once we found him,

36:58.082 --> 37:00.152
it was the only way he could
control the situation.

37:00.958 --> 37:03.726
Well, at least Conrad saved us
the trouble of a trial.

37:03.761 --> 37:07.230
And the best news is,
I'm out of your hair.

37:08.295 --> 37:10.430
The best news...

37:10.464 --> 37:12.665
is that it's over.

37:27.681 --> 37:28.948
Hey.

37:28.982 --> 37:31.050
I thought you went to bed
an hour ago.

37:31.084 --> 37:33.485
I couldn't sleep.

37:33.520 --> 37:36.288
I thought the case
was over.

37:36.322 --> 37:39.324
Oh, it is. Wrapped up
all nice and neat.

37:39.358 --> 37:41.726
That's a good thing, right?

37:41.761 --> 37:44.129
In a book,
that's a good thing.

37:44.163 --> 37:47.098
In real life,
nothing is that neat.

37:47.133 --> 37:49.868
What's got you still up?

37:49.902 --> 37:52.203
Gram.

37:52.238 --> 37:54.239
I can't believe
she's leaving tomorrow.

37:54.273 --> 37:56.207
I mean, yeah,
when she first moved in,

37:56.242 --> 37:59.210
I couldn't imagine having her
around all the time.

37:59.245 --> 38:04.148
But now I...
can't imagine her being gone.

38:05.204 --> 38:06.106
Listen...

38:06.976 --> 38:07.943
It's a fact of life.

38:09.131 --> 38:12.600
People we love leave us.

38:12.634 --> 38:14.468
Unless you chain 'em
to a radiator,

38:14.502 --> 38:17.204
which for some reason
is illegal.

38:17.238 --> 38:21.475
But, uh... knowing her...

38:21.510 --> 38:24.345
She'll be back
in six months.

38:24.379 --> 38:26.380
Oh, good.
You're both up.

38:26.611 --> 38:28.312
Darling, I need you to help me
decide on what to take.

38:28.505 --> 38:30.039
Oh, and I need to get
my bags down.

38:30.257 --> 38:31.725
Richard, could you
give us a hand?

38:33.035 --> 38:33.955
A hand.

38:34.802 --> 38:36.103
What?

38:38.983 --> 38:40.653
The bruising pattern
on the second victim--

38:40.801 --> 38:43.636
The killer used
his left hand.

38:43.670 --> 38:46.272
And... you see
his handwriting?

38:46.306 --> 38:49.208
Look at the slope on the "4"
and the loop on the "6."

38:49.242 --> 38:50.343
Yeah. So he was left-handed.

38:50.589 --> 38:53.090
Well, Ben Conrad shot himself
with his right hand.

38:53.124 --> 38:55.291
If the man in the window
was Ben Conrad,

38:55.326 --> 38:58.160
<i>He would've shot himself</i>
<i>on the left side.</i>

38:58.194 --> 38:59.728
Ben Conrad
didn't kill himself.

38:59.763 --> 39:01.866
Ben Conrad was murdered
by the man in the window.

39:01.901 --> 39:03.302
Ben--Ben's not our killer.

39:03.336 --> 39:06.071
The real killer
was just playing with us.
But the evidence--

39:06.106 --> 39:09.106
No, it was--it was planted there
to lead us to Ben.

39:09.140 --> 39:11.374
He wants us to think
it's over.

39:12.361 --> 39:14.295
He wants us to drop our guard.

39:14.329 --> 39:16.232
He wants to make a big scene.

39:17.245 --> 39:18.580
"Nikki will burn."

39:19.714 --> 39:20.681
Beckett.

39:20.876 --> 39:22.976
Oh, God.

39:23.011 --> 39:26.980
Montgomery took the detail
off her place. She's alone.

39:37.191 --> 39:39.028
She's not picking up.
Call the precinct.

39:39.239 --> 39:41.307
Tell them to get over there
right away.

39:41.342 --> 39:43.044
Tell them we were wrong. Tell
them the killer's still alive.

39:43.439 --> 39:45.742
You lock this door behind me.
Don't let anyone in.

39:45.752 --> 39:48.852
Captain Montgomery, please.
Yes, tell him it's an emergency.

40:06.380 --> 40:09.916
Come on, Beckett. Pick up.
Pick up the phone. Pick it up!

40:24.338 --> 40:25.272
What, Castle?

40:25.354 --> 40:27.355
It wasn't Ben Conrad.
He's not the killer!

40:27.356 --> 40:30.558
The killer's still alive!
The killer's still alive!

40:30.593 --> 40:32.727
<i>Good-bye, Nikki.</i>

40:33.051 --> 40:34.585
Kate!
