00:08.319 --> 00:09.520
(Episode 14)

00:16.020 --> 00:19.799
I'll leave all\Nmy happiness behind.

00:19.799 --> 00:21.499
("Waiting Room")

00:21.499 --> 00:22.560
Now I'll live...

00:23.330 --> 00:25.769
as an empty body.

00:32.670 --> 00:33.940
I love you.

00:36.010 --> 00:37.409
My everything.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.950
("Waiting Room")

01:38.940 --> 01:40.140
Seo Hyun Soo.

01:43.380 --> 01:44.449
Hyun Soo.

02:28.820 --> 02:32.189
Why do you suddenly\Nwant to play Jun?

02:34.929 --> 02:37.429
Because I want to\Nsay it...

02:40.200 --> 02:41.640
for the last time.

02:46.240 --> 02:47.379
Like Jun.

03:18.570 --> 03:19.580
Now I'll live...

03:21.140 --> 03:23.279
as an empty body.

03:30.089 --> 03:31.290
I love you.

03:34.219 --> 03:35.559
My everything.

03:37.659 --> 03:38.760
Goodbye.

03:49.570 --> 03:50.570
Bo Gook.

03:51.070 --> 03:52.939
Seo Hyun Soo's\NDNA result...

03:53.279 --> 03:54.510
arrives today, right?

03:56.179 --> 03:57.210
Yes.

03:57.749 --> 03:59.080
Please check it for me.

04:07.520 --> 04:09.390
("Waiting Room")

04:17.529 --> 04:18.899
(Genoise)

04:38.549 --> 04:39.659
Yes.

04:46.460 --> 04:49.000
Why can't we meet\Ntomorrow?

04:50.969 --> 04:52.469
Is the DNA result out?

04:53.969 --> 04:55.500
The person that died\N17 years ago...

04:57.010 --> 04:58.140
was Hyun Soo, right?

05:00.510 --> 05:01.539
Yes.

05:02.380 --> 05:03.710
It was Seo Hyun Soo.

05:05.680 --> 05:06.779
Are you sure?

05:07.649 --> 05:10.049
There's no other test\Nthat can be done.

05:10.049 --> 05:11.320
You have to believe\Nthe result.

05:11.320 --> 05:12.719
There's no other way.

08:06.159 --> 08:07.560
How am I going to\Nclean this up?

08:09.130 --> 08:10.870
It's midterm season.

08:36.089 --> 08:39.859
(Queen of Mystery 2)

08:50.670 --> 08:52.369
I think he studied a lot.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.180
- Do you think so too?\N- Yes.

08:54.180 --> 08:56.109
- No, I didn't.\N- You're lying.

08:58.879 --> 09:00.450
Where did you go\Nlast night?

09:00.450 --> 09:01.820
Your phone was off.

09:02.019 --> 09:03.190
I went to see a play.

09:03.349 --> 09:04.519
Alone? Again?

09:05.249 --> 09:06.460
I have a meeting.

09:06.859 --> 09:07.960
A meeting?

09:09.259 --> 09:10.859
Detective Ha is here.

09:12.129 --> 09:14.129
Let's start the meeting.\NLet's go.

09:18.369 --> 09:19.400
What are you doing?

09:19.599 --> 09:20.839
Why are you\Ncoming to the meeting?

09:21.869 --> 09:23.040
May I join?

09:23.339 --> 09:24.940
Why not?

09:25.009 --> 09:26.139
You heard him, right?

09:27.710 --> 09:30.680
Usually, perverts\Nlurk in areas like...

09:30.879 --> 09:33.050
school alleys,\Nbackstreets, parks,

09:33.050 --> 09:34.780
and near bus stops.

09:34.780 --> 09:37.119
But Joongjin 6-dong\Npervert...

09:37.119 --> 09:38.550
appears in places where...

09:38.550 --> 09:40.290
there are parking lots\Nand streets.

09:40.290 --> 09:43.530
That means\Nhe drives a car.

09:44.060 --> 09:46.060
There's a huge possibility\Nthat he lives in...

09:46.060 --> 09:48.229
Geumsang-dong\Nor Geumhwa-dong.

09:48.599 --> 09:50.629
Geumsang-dong\Nand Geumhwa-dong...

09:50.629 --> 09:52.229
are rich neighborhoods.

09:52.830 --> 09:55.499
You have a bias\Nthat perverts...

09:55.499 --> 09:57.339
live in\Npoor neighborhoods.

09:57.540 --> 09:59.410
There are\Na lot of perverts...

09:59.410 --> 10:01.639
that have highly-paid,\Nspecialized jobs.

10:02.680 --> 10:04.050
We arrested prosecutor,\Ndoctor,

10:04.050 --> 10:05.180
teacher, and principal.

10:05.180 --> 10:06.749
So who is the culprit?

10:06.749 --> 10:08.349
I don't expect you to\Nknow his name.

10:08.349 --> 10:09.379
Tell us his age,\Nappearance,

10:09.379 --> 10:10.420
and educational\Nbackground...

10:10.420 --> 10:11.450
just like a profiler does.

10:11.450 --> 10:12.920
I can't profile further...

10:12.920 --> 10:14.460
because I can't\Nquestion him.

10:15.119 --> 10:16.660
Please make more effort.

10:16.660 --> 10:19.460
If we can question him,\Nwe can find out that much.

10:19.460 --> 10:20.499
Of course.

10:21.030 --> 10:22.030
Stop it.

10:22.030 --> 10:23.599
I didn't say\Nanything wrong.

10:23.869 --> 10:25.070
Any questions?

10:26.499 --> 10:28.070
When is the staff dinner?

10:30.509 --> 10:31.839
We can't have\Nstaff dinner now.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.580
The perverts\Nare roaming around.

10:33.580 --> 10:34.839
Gosh.

10:35.440 --> 10:36.450
I know.

10:36.650 --> 10:38.379
We're short\Non information as is.

10:38.609 --> 10:39.979
I'll go ask around\Nfor more information.

10:41.280 --> 10:42.280
Me too.

10:45.249 --> 10:47.259
I'm okay with doing it\Nalone with you.

10:53.129 --> 10:54.759
- Guys.\N- Yes?

10:54.759 --> 10:57.030
Have you seen a man\Nin a trench coat?

10:57.030 --> 10:58.129
- No.\N- No.

10:58.129 --> 10:59.129
Okay.

10:59.170 --> 11:00.200
Have fun.

11:01.769 --> 11:02.769
Guys.

11:02.969 --> 11:05.570
Have you seen a man\Nin a trench coat?

11:05.570 --> 11:06.979
- No.\N- No.

11:06.979 --> 11:08.680
- Is that right?\N- Detective Ha.

11:11.879 --> 11:12.879
Let's do it again.

11:13.719 --> 11:14.719
What's up?

11:15.849 --> 11:18.190
Is he a detective too?

11:18.349 --> 11:21.519
He's the best in catching\Nculprits in the town.

11:21.519 --> 11:22.519
Have you...

11:22.989 --> 11:23.989
seen a man in\Na trench coat?

11:23.989 --> 11:26.859
No, my older sister has.

11:27.800 --> 11:30.099
- Your sister?\N- She almost got dragged.

11:31.070 --> 11:33.040
She almost couldn't\Ncome back home.

11:35.239 --> 11:36.810
She was walking\Nin the alley,

11:36.810 --> 11:39.580
and someone passed\Nby her suddenly.

11:56.859 --> 11:59.430
Tell me more about the\Ngirl who met the pervert.

11:59.430 --> 12:00.859
We received the report.

12:01.660 --> 12:02.660
Well...

12:03.030 --> 12:04.400
It happened in\NJoongjin 6-dong.

12:04.969 --> 12:07.499
In the dead-end alley,

12:07.670 --> 12:09.339
he disappeared quickly.

12:09.869 --> 12:12.839
I guess it's going rampant\Nbecause of warm weather.

12:12.839 --> 12:15.280
Goodness, those punks.

12:16.109 --> 12:17.450
- Seol Ok.\N- Yes?

12:17.450 --> 12:19.849
- The gloves.\N- I got the book here.

12:19.849 --> 12:21.320
- What about the gloves?\N- The gloves...

12:21.320 --> 12:23.420
You can't put\Nthe scissors here.

12:23.420 --> 12:24.690
Goodness,\Nyou're frustrating me.

12:24.690 --> 12:26.589
- Did you hang the banner?\N- Over there.

12:26.589 --> 12:28.589
Put it up here like this.

12:28.589 --> 12:30.430
- Please put it up.\N- Where's the podium?

12:30.430 --> 12:32.930
- Over here.\N- That's the chief's mic.

12:32.930 --> 12:34.700
- The host's podium.\N- Okay, okay.

12:34.700 --> 12:36.930
- You have to put it here.\N- I'll have it ready.

12:36.930 --> 12:38.999
Why is the podium\Nnot ready?

12:39.269 --> 12:40.400
What about the snacks?

12:40.400 --> 12:43.210
- Yes.\N- The chief likes sweets.

12:43.210 --> 12:44.810
- Should I go buy some?\N- Buy some sweet ones.

12:44.810 --> 12:46.940
- Where's his chair?\N- Here.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.239
Put a cushion on it.

12:48.239 --> 12:50.080
How could you not\Ndo the job properly?

12:50.080 --> 12:51.080
This is frustrating.

12:51.080 --> 12:53.950
By the way, what about his\Ncongratulatory message?

12:54.249 --> 12:55.619
Are you done writing it?

12:55.719 --> 12:57.150
Are you worried\Nabout me now?

12:57.150 --> 12:58.619
Goodness.\NThis is ridiculous.

13:00.960 --> 13:02.160
What? What do I do?

13:02.160 --> 13:04.129
Gosh, I forgot\Nthe most important thing.

13:04.129 --> 13:05.160
Go write it quickly.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.400
- Okay.\N- Okay.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.330
I could've been\Nin trouble.

13:10.900 --> 13:12.300
- Ms. Yoo.\N- Yes?

13:12.300 --> 13:13.639
- Thank you.\N- You can do it!

13:13.639 --> 13:14.739
Okay.

13:18.440 --> 13:19.540
Detective Ha!

13:19.739 --> 13:20.780
You're out early.

13:20.979 --> 13:22.609
I thought you were busy\Nrunning Mr. Jo's errands.

13:22.609 --> 13:24.879
I lived with my in-laws\Nfor eight years.

13:24.879 --> 13:27.050
I'm the expert in how to\Ndeal with naggers.

13:27.150 --> 13:28.249
I'm aware of that.

13:28.249 --> 13:30.050
- Let's go, then.\N- Okay, let's hurry.

13:30.050 --> 13:31.050
Hurry.

13:52.369 --> 13:54.180
The first Seo Hyun Soo.

14:28.839 --> 14:29.950
Mr. Kim?

14:32.780 --> 14:33.780
Who are you?

14:36.290 --> 14:37.519
I'm Hyun Soo.

14:38.450 --> 14:39.489
Seo Hyun Soo.

15:03.550 --> 15:06.479
He often appeared\Naround this town.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.619
A lot of my friends\Nran into him too.

15:09.450 --> 15:12.019
I heard he likes it better\Nwhen women scream,

15:12.650 --> 15:15.160
so I made a detour\Non purpose.

15:16.560 --> 15:18.160
- You mean, there?\N- Yes.

15:48.190 --> 15:49.320
Did he chase you?

15:49.320 --> 15:50.330
No.

16:02.339 --> 16:04.170
I turned back,\Nfeeling assured.

16:04.369 --> 16:06.540
But he appeared before me\Nall of a sudden.

16:19.660 --> 16:21.290
He covered my mouth...

16:21.560 --> 16:24.089
and dragged me\Ninside the alley.

16:28.060 --> 16:30.729
I don't remember what\Nhappened next clearly.

16:30.769 --> 16:32.170
Don't do this.

16:32.969 --> 16:34.839
Hey, stop right there.

16:36.339 --> 16:37.570
At that time,

16:37.869 --> 16:40.310
if the police officer\Ndidn't pass by...

16:45.410 --> 16:47.749
Do you remember\Nwhat he looks like?

16:48.249 --> 16:50.550
No, I don't.\NHe was covering his face.

16:50.550 --> 16:51.749
Any other characteristics?

16:52.150 --> 16:54.389
Like his height or build.

16:54.589 --> 16:56.530
He looked like\Nan ordinary man.

16:56.530 --> 16:59.359
Don't you remember\Nanything special?

17:00.560 --> 17:03.670
He was wearing\Nleather gloves.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.170
Can we stop now?

17:08.868 --> 17:11.069
I can't stand being\Nin this place anymore.

17:23.249 --> 17:25.650
Please catch him.

17:25.650 --> 17:28.489
I have to pass that alley\Nto get back home.

17:29.259 --> 17:31.029
It's scaring me to death.

17:31.759 --> 17:32.829
We'll...

17:33.660 --> 17:34.960
make sure to catch him.

17:36.059 --> 17:37.799
Thank you.

17:37.799 --> 17:38.870
Don't worry.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.539
Thank you.

17:56.049 --> 17:57.120
"I'm sorry"?

18:01.660 --> 18:03.190
What is she sorry about?

18:04.190 --> 18:05.229
About killing the victim?

18:05.860 --> 18:07.329
Or about making\Nher get killed?

18:10.600 --> 18:12.700
(Violent Crimes Unit 2)

18:15.370 --> 18:17.670
When will our boss\Ncome in to work?

18:18.210 --> 18:19.579
Where on earth is he...

18:19.579 --> 18:20.840
without his crutch?

18:20.840 --> 18:22.979
He works without\Nletting others know.

18:22.979 --> 18:25.009
He doesn't let others\Nknow, so how do you know?

18:25.880 --> 18:28.150
It's better when the\Nboss doesn't work.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.219
That's right.

18:29.590 --> 18:30.590
Constable Lee,

18:30.950 --> 18:33.190
I see the alleyways are\Nvery complicated.

18:33.190 --> 18:34.819
That place\Nis totally like a maze.

18:34.989 --> 18:36.789
Only the long-time\Nresidents know the way.

18:36.789 --> 18:38.160
Other people just use\Nthe paths they're used to.

18:39.559 --> 18:41.460
He didn't chase\Nthe victim,

18:41.460 --> 18:43.329
but he suddenly\Nshowed up before her.

18:47.940 --> 18:49.710
I turned back,\Nfeeling assured.

18:49.870 --> 18:51.910
But he appeared before me\Nall of a sudden.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.509
- He knows the shortcuts.\N- I told them.

18:54.840 --> 18:56.610
Someone who's well-aware\Nof the alleyway paths?

18:57.479 --> 18:58.910
Does he live in that area?

19:02.420 --> 19:03.690
I'll go ask around\Nfor more information.

19:04.350 --> 19:05.350
Hey.

19:07.590 --> 19:09.319
Why is he so passionate?

19:10.430 --> 19:11.690
That place...

19:12.029 --> 19:14.729
is close to his daughter's\Nelementary school.

19:17.130 --> 19:19.600
Children make their\Nparents change indeed.

19:19.600 --> 19:20.940
- Constable Lee.\N- Yes?

19:20.940 --> 19:22.640
Do you have the map around\Nthe area in your office?

19:22.640 --> 19:24.469
- Yes.\N- Bring it. Hurry.

19:28.140 --> 19:29.140
Get the car ready.

19:30.779 --> 19:32.450
- Wan Seung.\N- Ji Seung.

19:32.450 --> 19:33.549
What brings you here?

19:33.549 --> 19:36.450
I'm here to give legal\Nadvice to the center here.

19:36.450 --> 19:37.719
Why didn't you call me?

19:37.719 --> 19:38.950
I'm telling you now.

19:46.600 --> 19:47.930
Are you here because\Nof the center too?

19:49.259 --> 19:52.999
Jang Goo wanted\Nmy help badly.

19:53.840 --> 19:54.840
Jang Goo?

20:01.140 --> 20:02.979
President Ha Ji Seung?

20:04.309 --> 20:06.549
Yes, hello.

20:06.979 --> 20:09.049
Go attend to\Nyour business then.

20:12.219 --> 20:13.789
It's this way. Let's go.

20:14.420 --> 20:16.590
Joongjin Police Station\Nhas elevators...

20:16.590 --> 20:18.590
as befits\Nthe top police station...

20:18.590 --> 20:20.499
for solving\Nviolent crimes.

20:21.660 --> 20:22.660
Let's go.

20:25.569 --> 20:27.969
Chief Shin must've come up\Nwith a strange event,

20:28.039 --> 20:30.009
seeing how he gathered\Nall the renowned people.

20:30.009 --> 20:31.269
Don't get me started.

20:31.269 --> 20:33.180
To welcome\Nthe influential visitors,

20:33.180 --> 20:35.809
they even nagged me about\Nthe font for the banner.

20:35.809 --> 20:37.380
They aren't\Nthat influential.

20:38.009 --> 20:39.450
I saw your brother on TV.

20:39.450 --> 20:40.779
But I guess it wasn't\Nanything huge...

20:40.779 --> 20:42.120
since\Nhe was released quickly.

20:42.749 --> 20:43.950
Why? Were you worried?

20:44.450 --> 20:45.489
A little.

20:46.289 --> 20:47.390
Why didn't you\Nsay anything?

20:47.390 --> 20:49.289
You don't like to\Ntalk about your family.

20:49.729 --> 20:52.029
I thought I was helping\Nto ignore that.

20:52.029 --> 20:53.130
Hop in.

20:59.739 --> 21:01.900
(Police Officers and\NLawyers Unite for...)

21:01.900 --> 21:04.269
(Joongjin Police Station\NCivil Affairs Center)

21:07.710 --> 21:09.950
Let us cut off tape...

21:09.950 --> 21:12.509
to commemorate\Nthe establishment...

21:12.509 --> 21:14.650
of Joongjin Police Station\NCivil Affairs Center.

21:15.579 --> 21:16.620
Please.

21:26.029 --> 21:27.829
Please take this.

21:34.370 --> 21:37.340
You can cut it off\Non the count of three.

21:37.809 --> 21:40.079
In 1, 2, 3.

21:40.680 --> 21:42.410
Please give them\Na big hand.

21:59.930 --> 22:02.130
The victim was\Nstanding in this alley,

22:02.130 --> 22:03.670
and this is where\Nshe was dragged into.

22:03.670 --> 22:05.499
- It's in this direction.\N- Yes.

22:05.499 --> 22:07.100
Right? Let's go.

22:07.569 --> 22:08.569
Let's go.

22:10.309 --> 22:13.309
When I ran over,\Nhe ran off that way.

22:18.309 --> 22:20.249
Hey, stop right there.

22:28.819 --> 22:29.960
And he disappeared...

22:30.989 --> 22:32.190
right here.

22:41.200 --> 22:44.140
This is a dead end.

22:45.009 --> 22:47.180
I know. I also have\Nno idea what happened.

22:55.019 --> 22:58.420
There was a fancy bouquet\Nleft on the stage.

22:59.319 --> 23:01.160
I don't know\Nwho left it there though.

23:05.989 --> 23:07.460
The second Seo Hyun Soo.

23:13.739 --> 23:15.340
How are you?

23:17.440 --> 23:19.469
How many names\Ndo you have?

23:22.479 --> 23:23.610
What is...

23:25.009 --> 23:26.479
your name...

23:28.319 --> 23:29.350
today?

23:37.489 --> 23:38.890
He disappeared here?

23:38.890 --> 23:39.900
Yes.

23:40.029 --> 23:42.100
Then he might be living\Nsomewhere here.

23:42.100 --> 23:43.630
He knows\Nthese alleys by heart.

23:54.539 --> 23:55.680
Hello.

23:55.680 --> 23:58.450
Sir, is there a young man\Nwho lives in your house?

23:59.450 --> 24:01.549
He lives here by himself.

24:01.549 --> 24:02.549
He has no family.

24:02.549 --> 24:04.489
Only volunteers come to\Nvisit every now and then.

24:04.489 --> 24:05.620
Do you live alone?

24:06.150 --> 24:07.819
Do you live alone?\NBy yourself?

24:10.160 --> 24:11.460
Excuse me.

24:11.829 --> 24:13.630
Are there any other\Nfamily members?

24:13.759 --> 24:15.700
No, I'm all alone.

24:15.700 --> 24:17.499
How long\Nhave you lived here?

24:17.499 --> 24:19.739
About 40 years. Why?

24:21.640 --> 24:22.670
Okay.

24:24.469 --> 24:25.509
Yes?

24:27.239 --> 24:28.309
Excuse me.

24:29.579 --> 24:30.710
We're the police.

24:31.479 --> 24:33.519
Have you lived here\Nfor long?

24:33.519 --> 24:35.850
No, I just moved in.

24:36.489 --> 24:38.289
- Do you live alone?\N- Yes.

24:38.690 --> 24:40.559
Okay. Thank you.

25:04.479 --> 25:06.150
I don't think this is\Nthe first time we meet,

25:06.950 --> 25:08.049
Inspector Woo.

25:09.850 --> 25:12.590
It's been a while,\NMs. Jung Hee Yeon.

25:13.360 --> 25:15.319
Aren't you going to\Ntake your phone?

25:16.630 --> 25:17.690
Throw it away.

25:18.930 --> 25:20.499
It might be dangerous\Nfor me.

25:28.799 --> 25:30.140
Where are you?

25:30.509 --> 25:32.910
What can you give me\Nif I tell you?

25:34.309 --> 25:35.809
I do need something.

25:45.549 --> 25:47.160
I knew you would come.

25:48.660 --> 25:51.190
That young lady\Nlooked very curious.

25:54.160 --> 25:56.829
You did your very best\Nto get your face...

25:56.870 --> 25:58.400
on the security footage.

26:08.840 --> 26:11.380
You can never trust how\Nclear those footages are.

26:13.150 --> 26:14.380
Don't you think so?

26:15.380 --> 26:16.690
Inspector Woo Sung Ha?

26:22.019 --> 26:24.329
Aren't perverts like him\Nusually exhibitionists?

26:25.259 --> 26:26.759
They get aroused\Nand run away...

26:26.759 --> 26:28.329
when women scream at them.

26:28.600 --> 26:29.670
You're right.

26:29.829 --> 26:32.969
They usually aren't\Nas violent as he is.

26:33.900 --> 26:35.769
Do you think\Nhe's really...

26:36.170 --> 26:37.469
one of those people\Nwe met?

26:38.410 --> 26:39.979
No matter how dark it was,

26:40.239 --> 26:42.440
the middle-aged man\Ncouldn't have passed...

26:43.110 --> 26:44.950
as a normal-sized guy.

26:44.950 --> 26:46.049
You're right.

26:46.319 --> 26:47.549
Anything else?

26:47.549 --> 26:49.989
His height or build.

26:50.019 --> 26:51.920
He was just normal.

26:52.120 --> 26:54.890
That office guy\Njust moved here.

26:55.190 --> 26:57.960
He's infamous\Naround this neighborhood.

26:58.460 --> 27:00.400
A lot of my friends\Nsaw him too.

27:00.430 --> 27:03.630
So he couldn't be\Ninfamous in that area.

27:04.499 --> 27:06.739
Gosh, who's the pervert?

27:08.100 --> 27:11.170
I'm suspicious\Nof that old man's house.

27:11.309 --> 27:14.410
He looked weak,\Nand he could barely hear.

27:14.410 --> 27:17.410
Not that old man.\NI mean that house.

27:18.710 --> 27:19.920
Genoise.

27:21.150 --> 27:22.950
That's an uncanny name\Nfor a shop.

27:23.890 --> 27:26.789
Genoise is the base\Nfor making cake.

27:28.059 --> 27:29.960
If genoise\Nisn't delicious,

27:29.960 --> 27:32.660
no amount of good cream\Ncan make it better.

27:33.029 --> 27:34.299
The second Genoise...

27:34.299 --> 27:36.299
is next to\Nthe police headquarters.

27:38.900 --> 27:40.499
The third Genoise...

27:41.100 --> 27:42.739
is next to\NSeodong Police Station.

27:45.340 --> 27:47.110
And the fourth Genoise...

27:47.440 --> 27:49.509
is right across\NJoongjin Police Station.

27:53.049 --> 27:55.749
Every single branch\Nof Genoise...

27:56.489 --> 27:58.719
is near a police station.

27:59.719 --> 28:02.219
It's more secure to be\Naround a police station.

28:02.690 --> 28:05.930
I mean, I run these\Nplaces by myself.

28:05.930 --> 28:07.029
All those stations...

28:07.600 --> 28:09.829
are where Lieutenant Ha\Nhas worked...

28:10.670 --> 28:12.329
or is currently working.

28:15.700 --> 28:17.210
(Welcome. We'll provide\Nthe best service.)

28:17.239 --> 28:18.340
Why are we\Nat the borough office?

28:18.769 --> 28:21.079
Welfare groups keep\Nkeys to the houses...

28:21.079 --> 28:23.850
of elders who live\Nby themselves...

28:23.850 --> 28:26.479
in case of emergency\Nor death.

28:26.479 --> 28:29.019
So someone could've\Nused a key to get in?

28:36.390 --> 28:39.130
He disappeared\Nin that alley after all.

28:39.559 --> 28:40.600
You're right.

28:44.829 --> 28:47.440
Where on earth\Nis the first Genoise?

28:47.840 --> 28:49.640
All of our cakes\Ntaste the same.

28:50.140 --> 28:53.710
You don't need to\Ngo find the first shop.

28:53.940 --> 28:57.950
I don't think you make\Ncake at the first one.

29:05.650 --> 29:07.219
("Troupe Jenne and Jun\NCloses Down")

29:07.219 --> 29:09.460
This is the first\NGenoise, isn't it?

29:10.630 --> 29:12.430
The troupe\Nwhich premiered...

29:12.430 --> 29:13.759
"Waiting Room"\Ntook the names...

29:13.759 --> 29:16.670
of the main characters,\NJenne and Jun.

29:17.269 --> 29:18.769
So it's called\NJenne and Jun, right?

29:20.100 --> 29:22.469
The sign got old,\Nand some letters fell out.

29:22.469 --> 29:23.710
It was made to sound\Nlike "Genoise".

29:25.009 --> 29:26.279
It wasn't for the bread.

29:32.279 --> 29:33.819
Nice to meet you.

29:34.680 --> 29:35.819
Ms. Seo Hyun Soo.

29:43.259 --> 29:45.430
Thank you. All right.

29:48.600 --> 29:51.370
People would've thought\Nhe was a thief...

29:51.370 --> 29:54.039
if he got into a house\Nother than the old man's.

29:54.640 --> 29:55.739
It's one of\Nthe volunteers...

29:55.739 --> 29:57.809
or someone who can\Nget a hold of the key...

29:57.809 --> 29:58.969
to make a copy.

29:59.269 --> 30:00.440
Only one person\Nis in charge...

30:00.440 --> 30:01.610
of these volunteers,\Nso it won't be quick,

30:01.610 --> 30:03.009
but she's going to...

30:03.009 --> 30:05.309
try to get back to us\Nas soon as she can.

30:05.610 --> 30:07.620
All right. We got him.

30:09.219 --> 30:11.420
Two women named\NSeo Hyun Soo died.

30:11.749 --> 30:13.719
There were two bouquets.

30:14.289 --> 30:17.029
There might be\Nmore bouquets.

30:19.029 --> 30:20.529
Did you leave\Nthe bouquet...

30:21.160 --> 30:22.900
because you were sorry?

30:23.029 --> 30:24.799
Or was it to thank them...

30:25.630 --> 30:27.170
for dying in your place?

30:28.840 --> 30:30.840
That's why I asked you...

30:32.670 --> 30:33.940
to help them.

30:36.910 --> 30:37.979
I'm Seo Hyun Soo.

30:38.350 --> 30:39.620
I want to meet you.

30:39.680 --> 30:41.850
I heard you can help me.

30:42.380 --> 30:44.049
I'm being chased now.

30:47.160 --> 30:49.219
You're the one\Nwho dragged me in...

30:50.059 --> 30:51.160
from the start.

30:52.759 --> 30:55.329
I picked a place that was\Nthe least painful.

30:56.499 --> 30:58.170
But you made\Na lot of fuss.

30:58.299 --> 31:00.140
Were you trying to\Nlook like Secretary Kim?

31:00.299 --> 31:02.170
Or were you trying\Nto be her?

31:06.009 --> 31:07.239
I'm here...

31:08.079 --> 31:10.210
to arrest a criminal.

31:13.579 --> 31:14.719
Under what charges?

31:16.079 --> 31:19.019
For hiring\Na fake Seo Hyun Soo?

31:19.019 --> 31:21.620
For obstruction of justice\Nand...

31:23.090 --> 31:24.259
attempted murder.

31:35.400 --> 31:37.170
There's no\Nsecurity footage.

31:37.739 --> 31:39.440
I erased\Nall the fingerprints.

31:39.910 --> 31:41.180
And I...

31:42.610 --> 31:43.910
scrapped the car I drove.

31:48.749 --> 31:50.690
A case like this\Nis perfect...

31:50.749 --> 31:53.920
for Inspector Woo\Nto profile.

31:54.489 --> 31:57.329
I wonder where Mr. Woo\Nis off to these days.

31:58.360 --> 32:00.200
You called him Mr. Woo,

32:00.200 --> 32:02.059
not lying profiler.

32:02.529 --> 32:04.229
You said I should be\Nfriends with him.

32:05.870 --> 32:07.640
So you listened to me?

32:08.140 --> 32:09.710
Detective Ha,\Nyou're a good man.

32:09.710 --> 32:10.969
I need to get\Ninformation...

32:10.969 --> 32:12.610
about Secretary Kim\Nfrom him.

32:12.610 --> 32:14.710
Then cook for him.

32:14.710 --> 32:17.410
I fell for your\Ncooking skills.

32:19.180 --> 32:21.620
Wait. Did you fall\Nfor my cooking skills?

32:21.620 --> 32:23.519
Yes. An unexpected charm.

32:24.319 --> 32:26.620
You look like a chef.

32:27.559 --> 32:28.660
- Really?\N- Yes.

32:28.759 --> 32:31.130
Come over. I'll cook\Neverything you like.

32:31.789 --> 32:34.200
No. Inspector Woo\Nwill be there.

32:35.729 --> 32:38.930
Right. He makes people\Nfeel uncomfortable.

32:38.999 --> 32:40.700
He's not comfortable\Nlike me.

32:48.710 --> 32:50.910
Why are you trying\Nto catch Secretary Kim?

32:51.579 --> 32:53.950
Why are you being chased\Nby Secretary Kim?

32:54.249 --> 32:56.249
Why is she trying to\Nkill you?

32:57.620 --> 32:58.620
Fine.

33:00.090 --> 33:01.489
Let's not try to find out\Ntoo much...

33:01.489 --> 33:02.719
about each other.

33:07.100 --> 33:09.829
Why did you drag me\Nin here?

33:10.969 --> 33:12.670
I want to live.

33:13.739 --> 33:15.769
And you want to find\NSecretary Kim.

33:17.370 --> 33:20.079
I think we can trust\Neach other.

33:23.509 --> 33:24.579
How about it?

33:25.249 --> 33:26.650
Why don't we join forces?

33:29.019 --> 33:30.719
If we catch Secretary Kim,

33:31.249 --> 33:33.059
nobody else will die.

33:34.559 --> 33:36.160
That's all I want.

33:36.590 --> 33:38.489
I will catch Secretary Kim\Nno matter what.

33:38.690 --> 33:40.259
I don't need your help.

33:43.100 --> 33:45.569
Do you know\Nwho Secretary Kim is?

33:48.769 --> 33:51.469
Then it'll take a while.

33:52.309 --> 33:55.940
I know\Nwho Secretary Kim is.

34:01.219 --> 34:04.190
Everyone knows\Nthat you're a busy man.

34:04.620 --> 34:06.259
I can't believe\Nyou're here...

34:06.259 --> 34:07.789
for an event\Nat a small police station.

34:07.989 --> 34:09.860
It's not small.

34:09.889 --> 34:12.228
Joongjin Station has\Nnumber one arrest rate.

34:12.460 --> 34:13.559
Well, thank you.

34:13.960 --> 34:16.969
We call it\NCivil Affairs Center,

34:16.969 --> 34:18.869
but you can come by\Nwhenever you're free...

34:18.869 --> 34:21.768
and just counsel\Npeople's complaints.

34:21.768 --> 34:24.039
I want to come here often.

34:24.039 --> 34:25.139
Do you?

34:25.139 --> 34:27.210
My brother works here\Ncoincidentally.

34:28.978 --> 34:30.050
Yes, right.

34:30.579 --> 34:32.449
Just give me a call\Nbefore you come,

34:32.449 --> 34:34.280
and I'll always\Nbe on standby.

34:35.150 --> 34:36.219
Thank you.

34:37.248 --> 34:39.489
Not at all.\NI'll visit often.

34:39.489 --> 34:41.289
Please.\NCall me beforehand.

34:41.289 --> 34:42.659
I will. Thank you.

34:42.659 --> 34:43.829
- Goodbye.\N- Take care.

34:47.360 --> 34:48.360
Ji Seung.

34:48.699 --> 34:49.800
Hi, Wan Seung.

34:51.469 --> 34:52.530
Why are you still here?

34:52.530 --> 34:54.570
I had tea with the chief.

34:55.099 --> 34:57.909
I never even had water\Nwith him.

34:58.639 --> 35:01.280
I should work for Ha\Nand Jung. It's sad.

35:01.280 --> 35:03.309
I'd love it if you did.

35:05.179 --> 35:06.179
And who is this?

35:06.820 --> 35:07.820
Is she your colleague?

35:08.220 --> 35:09.220
Your girlfriend?

35:09.220 --> 35:10.920
- Colleague.\N- Colleague.

35:14.190 --> 35:15.260
Hello.

35:15.720 --> 35:18.490
Wan Seung is still\Nquite childish.

35:18.490 --> 35:19.630
Please be understanding.

35:19.630 --> 35:21.059
Why are you\Nacting like a parent?

35:21.059 --> 35:23.999
Of course. I'll take\Ngood care of him.

35:24.570 --> 35:27.539
Do you want to have lunch\Nwith me? I'll buy.

35:27.539 --> 35:28.900
I'll be coming here often.

35:28.900 --> 35:29.909
So next time.

35:29.909 --> 35:31.539
Don't play hard to get.

35:31.539 --> 35:33.679
I said I'd treat you.

35:33.840 --> 35:34.909
I'm sorry.

35:35.139 --> 35:37.010
I'll see you next time.

35:37.010 --> 35:38.010
Bye.

35:42.050 --> 35:44.220
He's not like you.

35:44.220 --> 35:46.090
He's kind and intelligent.

35:46.090 --> 35:48.590
Does that mean\NI'm unkind and stupid?

35:48.590 --> 35:50.429
You're wild...

35:50.429 --> 35:51.490
and innocent.

35:52.760 --> 35:54.499
Mr. Jo is looking for you.\NGet back inside.

35:55.900 --> 35:56.900
Bye.

36:01.900 --> 36:02.909
This way.

36:07.740 --> 36:08.909
Constable Lee.

36:09.979 --> 36:10.979
Yes?

36:12.679 --> 36:13.749
Who is this?

36:16.050 --> 36:17.690
She encountered\Na pervert...

36:17.920 --> 36:19.860
in an alley\Nin Joongjin 6-dong.

36:21.619 --> 36:23.289
- Is that so?\N- Yes.

36:24.490 --> 36:25.490
Here.

36:27.530 --> 36:29.769
Could you please tell us\Nwhat happened...

36:29.970 --> 36:31.470
in detail?

36:34.699 --> 36:36.340
I was walking\Ndown the stairs,

36:36.570 --> 36:38.070
and I had a weird feeling.

36:39.170 --> 36:40.979
I felt like someone\Nwas watching me.

36:42.740 --> 36:45.010
I walked fast\Nand turned the corner.

36:45.979 --> 36:47.780
A pervert stood there.

36:49.519 --> 36:51.449
I was shocked and dazed.

37:02.829 --> 37:05.470
Did he drag you\Ninto the alley?

37:06.840 --> 37:07.840
Yes.

37:09.499 --> 37:10.639
Did you see his face?

37:10.769 --> 37:11.769
She did.

37:13.210 --> 37:14.710
She said he didn't\Ncover his face.

37:17.679 --> 37:19.510
I don't clearly\Nremember his face.

37:20.249 --> 37:21.920
I was so surprised,\Nand it was dark too.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.789
When did this happen?

37:24.789 --> 37:25.849
Two weeks ago.

37:27.690 --> 37:28.990
It's been a while.

37:29.360 --> 37:30.659
The evidence...

37:30.729 --> 37:32.329
must be gone by now.

37:32.929 --> 37:34.699
I couldn't report it.

37:35.429 --> 37:36.800
Because\NI was on my way home...

37:36.800 --> 37:38.329
late at night\Nafter drinking.

37:38.900 --> 37:41.070
I was afraid you'd say\Nthat's why I was attacked.

37:42.499 --> 37:44.869
You're an adult.\NIt's not a crime to drink.

37:45.110 --> 37:46.780
Why couldn't you\Nreport it?

37:46.909 --> 37:49.979
Because some people have\Nbiased views.

37:52.449 --> 37:55.220
Is there anything else\Nyou remember?

37:56.619 --> 37:57.619
I...

37:58.690 --> 38:00.119
bit his hand.

38:00.519 --> 38:01.559
What?

38:01.789 --> 38:02.860
His hand?

38:08.829 --> 38:09.929
Mr. Hwang.

38:10.470 --> 38:11.999
Isn't there a way?

38:16.199 --> 38:17.940
It's been two weeks.

38:18.240 --> 38:19.740
You won't be able to\Nfind him.

38:20.440 --> 38:23.380
Can't a genius scientific\Ninvestigator find him?

38:26.249 --> 38:28.079
It's not impossible.

38:30.920 --> 38:34.019
If she bit\Nthe culprit's hand hard.

38:37.389 --> 38:39.860
Her tooth mark could be\Nleft on his hand.

38:40.159 --> 38:43.269
Then we can compare the\Nmark with the victim's...

38:43.400 --> 38:44.900
and catch the criminal.

38:45.999 --> 38:47.300
That'll work.

38:47.800 --> 38:50.269
I have a picture\Nof Kim Han Na's teeth.

38:50.269 --> 38:53.110
A picture is enough\Nto do a comparison.

38:53.280 --> 38:55.979
Only Professor Hwang\Ncan make it possible.

38:58.780 --> 39:00.780
Did you catch\Nthe criminal?

39:00.780 --> 39:01.780
Not yet.

39:06.019 --> 39:09.260
Then how am I going to...

39:09.829 --> 39:12.030
make the comparison?

39:14.530 --> 39:16.329
Go get the criminal now.

39:54.139 --> 39:55.539
It's a dead end again.

39:56.199 --> 39:58.539
It must be the same guy.

40:25.999 --> 40:28.269
Where has he been?

40:30.309 --> 40:31.470
Be nice.

40:31.470 --> 40:33.280
You two live\Nin the same house.

40:33.280 --> 40:34.539
We're back.

40:34.679 --> 40:35.909
Inspector Woo.

40:36.909 --> 40:38.710
You're always together...

40:38.710 --> 40:40.019
when you have\Ndifferent jobs to do.

40:40.019 --> 40:41.849
It's because\Nof the pervert case.

40:42.179 --> 40:44.220
There's another victim.

40:44.220 --> 40:45.990
The assailant\Ntried to rape her.

40:47.059 --> 40:49.889
He isn't just a pervert.

40:55.260 --> 40:56.630
There are three reports...

40:56.630 --> 40:58.769
in total regarding\Nthe pervert in the town.

40:58.999 --> 41:00.900
The first victim\Nreported...

41:00.900 --> 41:03.039
that the pervert\Nchased her.

41:03.039 --> 41:04.039
Her name is Lee So Yeon.

41:04.110 --> 41:05.909
She ran toward the street.

41:05.909 --> 41:07.579
She turned back\Nafter running for a while,

41:07.579 --> 41:08.780
and he was gone.

41:08.780 --> 41:10.479
He chased her?

41:11.979 --> 41:14.479
The second victim\Nis Shim Ji Eun.

41:15.119 --> 41:17.249
The culprit dragged her\Ninside the alley,

41:17.249 --> 41:19.249
but then he was caught\Nby a constable...

41:19.249 --> 41:20.460
and ran away.

41:25.630 --> 41:27.229
Constable Lee\Nwent after him,

41:28.460 --> 41:30.929
but he disappeared\Nat a dead end.

41:31.229 --> 41:33.599
He dragged the victim\Ninto the alley.

41:33.670 --> 41:35.740
The last and third victim\Nis Kim Han Na.

41:36.470 --> 41:38.869
He appeared from hiding\Nand tried to drag her,

41:38.869 --> 41:40.579
and she barely escaped.

41:45.309 --> 41:47.650
The third victim\Nbit his hand.

41:52.420 --> 41:54.760
He wasn't wearing\Ngloves that time.

41:54.889 --> 41:58.090
It was dark, so Kim Han Na\Ncouldn't see it clearly,

41:58.090 --> 41:59.699
but he wasn't wearing\Na mask either.

41:59.699 --> 42:01.499
I don't clearly\Nremember his face.

42:01.999 --> 42:03.729
I was so surprised,\Nand it was dark too.

42:04.729 --> 42:06.539
But Shim Ji Eun...

42:06.740 --> 42:09.240
said he covered his face\Nwith a mask.

42:09.809 --> 42:12.909
Recently, he started\Nto wear gloves.

42:18.280 --> 42:19.619
Number one is Lee So Yeon.

42:19.619 --> 42:22.349
Number two is Kim Han Na.\NThe last is Shim Ji Eun.

42:24.519 --> 42:25.849
This is the order.

42:25.990 --> 42:27.889
You mean,\Nthe order of incidents?

42:27.889 --> 42:29.990
The order of reports\Nisn't important.

42:31.460 --> 42:32.490
You're right.

42:32.960 --> 42:35.260
Lee So Yeon, Kim Han Na,\Nand Shim Ji Eun.

42:35.900 --> 42:37.470
That's the correct\Norder of incidents.

42:37.470 --> 42:40.269
How did you know?

42:40.340 --> 42:42.369
The culprit is evolving.

42:42.909 --> 42:44.809
He exposed his\Nnaked body at first,

42:44.940 --> 42:46.639
then he attempted\Nto rape a woman.

42:46.909 --> 42:48.309
He walked around\Nwith a bare face at first,

42:48.309 --> 42:49.949
then he started\Nto wear a mask.

42:50.210 --> 42:51.579
He didn't wear anything\Non his hands at first,

42:52.210 --> 42:53.619
then he started\Nto wear gloves.

43:00.590 --> 43:01.820
He's no longer...

43:02.659 --> 43:04.059
just a pervert.

43:04.829 --> 43:07.960
He's getting more\Nand more dangerous.

43:08.659 --> 43:09.900
More and more.

43:34.420 --> 43:37.090
He'll go farther\Nthan being a rapist.

43:47.800 --> 43:49.940
He experienced failures...

43:49.940 --> 43:51.309
from Kim Han Na\Nand Shim Ji Eun.

43:51.740 --> 43:52.940
He must've been furious.

43:53.409 --> 43:55.039
He'll become more\Nand more perfect.

44:01.249 --> 44:02.579
We need to catch him soon.

44:03.289 --> 44:04.619
It will be impossible\Nto catch him...

44:04.619 --> 44:06.220
if he evolves more.

44:22.869 --> 44:23.970
He'll break his bounds...

44:23.970 --> 44:25.710
and expand his territory.

44:25.769 --> 44:27.440
He won't leave\Nany trace either.

44:48.630 --> 44:49.699
He will...

44:51.599 --> 44:53.070
commit a murder\Nfor certain.

44:53.240 --> 44:55.099
He must've killed\Nsomeone already.

44:56.099 --> 44:58.170
Don't get ahead too much.

44:58.570 --> 44:59.840
He already...

45:00.979 --> 45:02.510
became a monster.

45:06.519 --> 45:09.280
Such perverts\Nare in every town.

45:15.059 --> 45:16.090
Don't make Ah Ram\Ngo for...

45:16.090 --> 45:17.590
her private lessons\Nfrom tomorrow.

45:38.449 --> 45:39.510
Ji Seung.

45:41.349 --> 45:42.349
What?

45:42.820 --> 45:43.820
Tae Gyu.

45:44.289 --> 45:45.349
Long time no see.

45:45.349 --> 45:47.090
It's been\Nsuch a long time.

45:47.090 --> 45:49.590
I'm here to meet\Nmy cousin.

45:49.990 --> 45:52.030
You know\NWon Joo Seok, right?

45:52.429 --> 45:55.960
Yes, he talked about\Nyou during the lecture.

45:55.960 --> 45:57.670
I felt upset.

45:57.670 --> 45:59.599
Why did you\Ncut ties like that?

45:59.900 --> 46:03.010
We had a lot of fun\Nin the past.

46:03.639 --> 46:06.610
I'm sorry, but I need to\Ngo somewhere urgently.

46:06.610 --> 46:07.610
I'll see you later.

46:07.610 --> 46:09.139
- Let's have a drink.\N- Okay.

46:09.309 --> 46:11.210
- I'll call you.\N- Bye.

46:16.220 --> 46:17.619
I'm really okay.

46:20.789 --> 46:22.990
Lady acknowledged\Nmy cooking skills.

46:27.960 --> 46:30.769
Look into it, will you?\NYou live with him.

46:31.099 --> 46:32.400
Cook for him.

46:32.400 --> 46:34.639
Clean his place,\Nand get to know him.

46:36.639 --> 46:38.539
Wait. That's not salt.

46:38.670 --> 46:39.940
That's baking soda.

46:39.940 --> 46:42.780
I use it when I wash\Nfruits. How could you...

46:55.320 --> 46:56.389
Kyung Mi.

46:56.990 --> 46:59.229
Is there any way\Nto catch that pervert?

46:59.729 --> 47:01.999
We caught the last culprit\Nwith the poly-light.

47:03.099 --> 47:04.699
You said it's a rapist.

47:05.530 --> 47:07.900
You can't take the risk\Nand stake out.

47:08.369 --> 47:10.010
He may be a murderer.

47:10.010 --> 47:11.210
A serial killer.

47:11.510 --> 47:14.240
A pervert in a trench coat\Nis that dangerous?

47:14.240 --> 47:15.380
If we don't catch him,

47:15.380 --> 47:17.610
he might commit\Na more extreme crime.

47:26.050 --> 47:27.059
It's delicious.

47:27.990 --> 47:29.420
- It's mixed well.\N- Right.

47:29.990 --> 47:31.690
It's different from\Nthe way it looks.

47:32.429 --> 47:33.460
This is unusual.

47:34.099 --> 47:36.099
It's different from\Nthe way it looks.

47:39.300 --> 47:40.400
Well, okay.

47:42.470 --> 47:44.139
Lady enjoyed it very much.

47:44.909 --> 47:46.610
This isn't just okay.

47:46.809 --> 47:48.440
It's amazing.

47:49.139 --> 47:50.210
You're the best.

47:51.449 --> 47:53.150
Well, you're a profiler,

47:53.679 --> 47:56.320
so shouldn't you describe\Nthe taste in detail?

47:57.650 --> 47:58.849
It's edible.

48:01.460 --> 48:04.789
Except for the artificial\Nflavor enhancer,

48:05.289 --> 48:07.400
it doesn't taste so bad.

48:07.400 --> 48:10.400
But you have to enjoy the\Nfood with your eyes too,

48:10.400 --> 48:13.769
so your plating skills\Nmust be improved.

48:14.070 --> 48:15.639
He's such a know-all.

48:17.170 --> 48:18.170
Here.

48:21.710 --> 48:22.909
This is uncomfortable.

48:39.190 --> 48:41.059
It's so messy.

48:42.059 --> 48:43.499
Forget it.

48:43.929 --> 48:45.929
He'll clean the mess\Nif he thinks it's dirty.

48:58.880 --> 49:00.820
I cooked a meal for him,

49:00.820 --> 49:03.389
so isn't it natural\Nfor him to do the dishes?

49:03.389 --> 49:04.749
He's got no manners.

49:06.090 --> 49:08.420
Is it because he's\Nthe landlord? Goodness.

49:14.360 --> 49:15.400
Darn it.

49:22.039 --> 49:23.269
What happened?

49:34.449 --> 49:35.579
Darn it!

50:50.990 --> 50:51.990
Lady, you're here.

50:55.099 --> 50:56.269
I heard it's\Na woman's dead body.

50:57.499 --> 50:58.499
Over there?

50:59.269 --> 51:00.369
- Seol Ok.\N- Yes?

51:00.369 --> 51:01.869
Do you need anything\Nfor the investigation?

51:01.869 --> 51:03.940
Did you hear anything\Nabout the victim?

51:03.940 --> 51:05.369
Yes, I wrote it down.

51:05.369 --> 51:07.210
He thinks it's been days\Nsince she died.

51:07.210 --> 51:09.110
You're the famous MC Jay.

51:09.110 --> 51:11.249
No autographs while\NI'm on an official duty.

51:13.749 --> 51:15.119
- Thanks.\N- Sure.

51:16.949 --> 51:18.789
That fisherman over there\Nfound her.

51:25.760 --> 51:26.860
Good work.

51:31.570 --> 51:33.269
She must've been\Nmoved here.

51:38.869 --> 51:39.940
Don't come.

51:40.710 --> 51:41.710
Why not?

51:43.079 --> 51:44.179
We know her.

51:44.749 --> 51:45.749
Who is it?

51:46.979 --> 51:48.019
It's Yoon Mi Joo.

51:50.550 --> 51:52.090
The same Mi Joo\Nthat we know?

51:58.760 --> 51:59.760
No...

52:13.179 --> 52:16.179
I'm out of my office\Nto give a lecture.

52:17.479 --> 52:18.650
Oh, that?

52:18.650 --> 52:20.679
I'll take care\Nof that immediately.

52:21.420 --> 52:22.420
Okay.

52:24.090 --> 52:25.320
Great class, Professor Ha.

52:25.820 --> 52:26.820
Thanks.

52:27.260 --> 52:29.860
- See you next week.\N- I have to talk to you.

52:32.860 --> 52:34.199
I can't right now.

52:34.199 --> 52:36.769
Can you come to my office\Nin the afternoon?

52:36.769 --> 52:38.130
Okay, I'll be there.

52:38.699 --> 52:39.740
See you later.

52:40.199 --> 52:41.199
Goodbye.

52:57.389 --> 52:59.590
- You can't come in here.\N- Mi Joo.

53:02.059 --> 53:03.059
Mi Joo.

53:03.960 --> 53:05.460
You didn't die, right?

53:06.460 --> 53:07.999
You didn't!

53:16.199 --> 53:17.210
Ms. Yoon?

53:17.210 --> 53:19.210
You're under arrest\Nfor Lee Wang Sik's murder.

53:19.210 --> 53:20.210
What?

53:20.940 --> 53:21.940
Wait.

53:25.809 --> 53:27.050
The exam isn't important.

53:27.050 --> 53:29.019
You might\Nend up in prison.

53:29.179 --> 53:31.789
I prepared for this exam\Nfor three years,

53:32.019 --> 53:33.789
studying 18 hours a day.

53:34.789 --> 53:37.530
I'd rather go to prison\Nthan to go back...

53:37.960 --> 53:39.260
to Noryangjin\Nafter I fail again.

53:48.369 --> 53:50.210
When I was\Nin the detention center,

53:50.769 --> 53:52.840
I had this thought.

53:53.440 --> 53:55.579
If I become\Na police officer,

53:56.579 --> 53:58.150
would I be\Nable to do my job well?

53:59.110 --> 54:00.820
So I decided to...

54:01.220 --> 54:03.220
look around a little.

54:03.990 --> 54:06.090
I want to look at\Npeople walking past me.

54:06.960 --> 54:09.960
I'll look up at the night\Nsky from time to time.

54:10.530 --> 54:12.900
And I will sometimes\Nhave delicious coffee...

54:12.929 --> 54:15.099
with people I know.

54:42.389 --> 54:43.559
Mi Joo.

54:44.860 --> 54:46.499
I'll make sure\Nto catch the culprit.

55:01.780 --> 55:03.650
(Ha and Jung Law Firm)

55:06.449 --> 55:07.519
Come in.

55:10.249 --> 55:12.990
Hey, come in. Grab a seat.

55:13.059 --> 55:14.059
Okay.

55:17.059 --> 55:18.559
I'm sorry to bother you.

55:18.559 --> 55:19.659
No, it's okay.

55:20.599 --> 55:21.860
What is it?

55:21.860 --> 55:23.729
I have a favor to ask.

55:23.970 --> 55:25.030
What is it?

55:27.869 --> 55:28.869
Tell me.

55:30.269 --> 55:32.409
I got in trouble.

55:32.409 --> 55:33.479
In trouble?

55:34.710 --> 55:36.909
Can you introduce me\Nto Secretary Kim?

55:44.720 --> 55:46.119
Who is Secretary Kim?

55:46.590 --> 55:47.619
Professor Ha,

55:47.920 --> 55:50.229
I heard you used to be\NTae Gyu's friend.

55:54.599 --> 55:56.570
What are you\Ntrying to say?

55:57.829 --> 55:59.400
Tae Gyu told me that...

55:59.970 --> 56:02.240
Secretary Kim\Nhelped you out a lot.

56:02.909 --> 56:04.769
I heard you don't...

56:05.010 --> 56:07.179
let anyone else\Nmeet Secretary Kim.

56:13.749 --> 56:15.380
I need help too.

56:16.490 --> 56:17.550
Right now.

56:20.590 --> 56:22.360
What did you do?

56:23.889 --> 56:25.329
It's nothing huge.

56:27.159 --> 56:28.999
I killed someone\Nby accident.

56:30.800 --> 56:32.329
- What?\N- Yes.

56:33.070 --> 56:35.440
I'm about to graduate\Nmy law school,

56:36.440 --> 56:37.940
so I can't...

56:38.170 --> 56:39.409
complicate things.

56:51.220 --> 56:53.889
Yes. You can\Ngo home first.

56:54.920 --> 56:57.729
I'm out to meet\Nsomeone important.

56:58.260 --> 57:00.460
I think I'll go home\Nstraight from here.

57:02.800 --> 57:03.800
Yes.

57:05.269 --> 57:06.970
Okay, then.\NI'll see you tomorrow.

57:07.970 --> 57:08.970
Okay.

57:47.880 --> 57:49.010
Secretary Kim?

58:06.400 --> 58:07.860
President Ha Ji Seung.

58:09.729 --> 58:10.929
This is a surprise.

58:11.999 --> 58:14.340
I thought you cut me off,

58:14.670 --> 58:16.510
but you wanted to\Nsee me first.
