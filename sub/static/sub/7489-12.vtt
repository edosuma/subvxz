WEBVTT

00:07.941 --> 00:10.945
Okay, you put one hand here
and the other hand here.

00:10.946 --> 00:14.486
Austin, I know how to play.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.074

00:29.610 --> 00:32.314
Oh, yes! I got a horn-in-one.

00:32.316 --> 00:34.813
You rock at Clarinet Golf.

00:34.814 --> 00:37.374
Can I take you out to
dinner to celebrate?

00:37.375 --> 00:39.704
Austin Monica Moon.

00:39.705 --> 00:43.439
Are you asking me out on
our first official date?

00:43.440 --> 00:45.874
Why, yes I am.

00:45.875 --> 00:50.376
Ally... I don't know
your middle name Dawson.

00:50.377 --> 00:52.477
I accept.

00:52.478 --> 00:55.451
And I am never telling
you my middle name.

00:55.452 --> 00:58.820
Great. I want to take you
to Illusions Magic Cafe.

00:58.821 --> 01:03.639
The waiters are magicians, and
your hunger will disappear.

01:03.640 --> 01:04.935
Awesome.

01:04.936 --> 01:07.996
Pick me up at 7:30.

01:09.602 --> 01:11.715
Guess who's the best
manager in the world.

01:11.716 --> 01:14.277
Eh! Time's up. It's me.

01:14.278 --> 01:18.459
I got you a meeting with the producers
of this huge new animated movie.

01:18.460 --> 01:22.146
They want you to pitch them a song,
and if they like it, they'll use it.

01:22.147 --> 01:25.056
Trish, that's awesome.
What's the movie?

01:25.057 --> 01:26.826
It's called "Butch and Bitey".

01:26.827 --> 01:30.321
It's about the friendship
between a stray dog...

01:30.322 --> 01:33.492
And the streetwise flea
that lives on his butt.

01:33.493 --> 01:34.779
Nice.

01:34.780 --> 01:37.742
They sent over all this stuff
for you guys to get inspired.

01:37.743 --> 01:40.941
It's nice that someone's making
an original movie for a change

01:40.942 --> 01:43.525
and not some cheesy
mindless sequel.

01:43.526 --> 01:45.863
Guys, the new "Zaliens"
sequel is coming out!

01:45.864 --> 01:47.574
- Awesome!
- Sweet!

01:47.575 --> 01:50.408
"Zaliens 8: My Brains".

01:50.409 --> 01:51.600
Get it?

01:51.601 --> 01:55.752
It's like they ate my brains,
but it's the number eight.

01:55.753 --> 01:58.906
Man, those movies are genius.

01:58.907 --> 02:01.727
Zalien brain suck!

02:03.761 --> 02:05.621
Woo.

02:07.015 --> 02:09.717
Coming soon? I can't
wait that long.

02:09.719 --> 02:14.025
Well, you won't have to once Trish
and I win tickets to the premiere.

02:14.026 --> 02:17.769
They're having a contest where fans make
a video of their favorite Zaliens scene.

02:17.770 --> 02:22.754
With Dez's awesome directing, and
my amazing acting, we're gonna win.

02:22.755 --> 02:24.736
Did you just compliment Dez?

02:24.737 --> 02:26.995
Uh... what?

02:26.996 --> 02:28.651
You can't prove that.

02:28.652 --> 02:30.042
Or can I?

02:30.043 --> 02:32.863
Zalien brain suck!

02:32.949 --> 02:37.869
Oh, Ally. Leave the brain
sucking to the pros.

03:49.825 --> 03:52.217
Our first official date.

03:52.218 --> 03:55.387
- How cool is this place?
- So cool.

03:55.388 --> 03:58.704
So, how cool is this
weather we've been having?

03:58.705 --> 04:00.625
Cool.

04:00.675 --> 04:06.575
I mean, it's been really hot,
but it's cool that it's hot.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.991
So, how cool is this fork?

04:14.992 --> 04:16.634
Very cool.

04:16.635 --> 04:18.088
Four prongs.

04:18.089 --> 04:19.949
Woo.

04:20.940 --> 04:25.665
- Is it cool if we stop saying cool?
- Totally... yes.

04:25.666 --> 04:28.166
I'm Al The Magnificent.

04:28.167 --> 04:33.087
I'll be your waiter and
conjurer this evening.

04:35.576 --> 04:41.157
Tonight's specials are the Houdini
Linguini and Sleight of Hamburger.

04:41.158 --> 04:44.719
Well, I'll have the burger,
and the lady will have...

04:44.720 --> 04:47.540
- What do you want, Ally?
- I can order for myself.

04:47.541 --> 04:51.656
- I was just trying to be a gentleman.
- I appreciate it, but...

04:51.657 --> 04:52.759
Sorry.

04:52.760 --> 04:56.774
I'll have the now you seafood
salad, now you don't.

04:56.775 --> 05:00.975
Great. Would you
care for some rolls?

05:03.371 --> 05:05.651
Abracada...

05:05.807 --> 05:07.787
Bread!

05:11.312 --> 05:13.232
Whoa.

05:27.993 --> 05:29.873
Bread?

05:29.874 --> 05:32.694
Sorry sorry sorry.

05:33.334 --> 05:36.994
Hey... my chair is levitating.

05:37.866 --> 05:39.786
Cool.

05:47.207 --> 05:48.515
Hey, Ally.

05:48.516 --> 05:51.518
- Listen, about our date.
- It was weird, right?

05:51.519 --> 05:55.355
I know. It's like we couldn't
even talk to each other.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.357
How cool is this fork?

05:57.358 --> 05:59.427
Very cool.

05:59.428 --> 06:04.233
Even the coolest fork in
the world isn't that cool.

06:04.234 --> 06:06.902
Hey, how cool is
this cash register?

06:06.903 --> 06:09.063
So cool.

06:09.337 --> 06:11.099
What's wrong with us?

06:11.100 --> 06:15.943
I think we're putting too much pressure
on ourselves to be the perfect couple.

06:15.944 --> 06:17.069
You're right.

06:17.070 --> 06:19.196
Let's just work on the
"Butch and Bitey" song.

06:19.197 --> 06:21.175
It's never weird when
we write together.

06:21.176 --> 06:24.751
Yeah. Let's just focus on our music
and everything will be fine.

06:24.752 --> 06:27.988
So, I was thinking the song
should be an emotional ballad.

06:27.989 --> 06:30.430
It's gonna play during the scene
where Butch goes to the pound

06:30.431 --> 06:33.602
and they make him
wear a flea collar.

06:33.603 --> 06:36.493
Bitey almost doesn't make it.

06:36.494 --> 06:39.841
Don't you think the song should
be a little more fun and upbeat?

06:39.842 --> 06:44.572
I mean, it is about a flea
who lives on a dog's butt.

06:44.573 --> 06:46.617
So you don't like my idea?

06:46.618 --> 06:49.318
No, it's great.

06:49.907 --> 06:52.429
What about mine?

06:52.430 --> 06:55.370
Yours is great too.

06:55.401 --> 06:59.241
I'm so happy we're writing music
and it's not awkward anymore.

06:59.242 --> 07:00.820
Yep.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.921
Me too.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.910
So...

07:05.082 --> 07:08.862
How cool is this cash register?

07:09.797 --> 07:11.957
So cool.

07:23.685 --> 07:26.787
Gorlot, give me the
Kanthian Crystal.

07:26.788 --> 07:28.656
Never, Xantu.

07:28.657 --> 07:32.433
Then say good-bye to
your Zalien spawn!

07:32.434 --> 07:34.040
My babies!

07:34.041 --> 07:35.581
My locker!

07:35.582 --> 07:36.984
Cut!

07:36.985 --> 07:38.217
Where are all my books?

07:38.218 --> 07:41.539
- Oh, they're still in there.
- Wha...?

07:41.540 --> 07:44.000
Oh! Ah. Ewe.

07:44.444 --> 07:46.612
My books are all gooey.

07:46.613 --> 07:50.453
Who keeps books in their locker?

07:51.318 --> 07:55.232
- So how'd the date go?
- Oh, it was magical.

07:55.233 --> 07:58.809
As in our waiter pulled the
appetizers out of his sleeve.

07:58.810 --> 08:02.327
The date itself,
kind of awkward.

08:02.328 --> 08:04.813
Sometimes being a
couple changes things.

08:04.814 --> 08:09.301
I know. I was always afraid this
would happen if we started dating.

08:09.302 --> 08:11.545
Do you think we're
making a mistake?

08:11.546 --> 08:15.688
I don't know. On the one hand, you
guys seem perfect for each other.

08:15.689 --> 08:18.692
On the other hand, maybe
you're feeling extra pressure

08:18.693 --> 08:20.671
now that you're boyfriend
and girlfriend.

08:20.672 --> 08:22.343
On the other other hand...

08:22.344 --> 08:25.351
- Enough with the hands.
- Sorry.

08:25.352 --> 08:28.694
What do I do? I really want to
make this work with Austin.

08:28.695 --> 08:31.590
Don't think so much about the
whole relationship thing.

08:31.591 --> 08:35.166
Just go with the flow and
everything will work itself out.

08:35.167 --> 08:36.912
Ready to finish
shooting the scene?

08:36.913 --> 08:39.592
Ooh, I can't. I'm late
for my cousin's wedding.

08:39.592 --> 08:41.988
You're going dressed like that?

08:41.989 --> 08:44.329
Good catch.

08:49.172 --> 08:52.532
Almost forgot my bow tie.

09:06.193 --> 09:08.709
Dez, I gotta talk to you.

09:08.710 --> 09:11.817
Everything's been weird since
Ally and I started dating.

09:11.818 --> 09:14.638
What should I do?

09:15.776 --> 09:17.696
Whoa!

09:17.726 --> 09:20.851
Oh, can I get you to scream like
that again for my Zalien video?

09:20.852 --> 09:23.901
I can never get a girly
scream out of Trish.

09:23.902 --> 09:25.993
Dez, I need to talk to you.

09:25.994 --> 09:27.529
Now that Ally's my girlfriend,

09:27.530 --> 09:29.829
I'm afraid to tell her how I
really feel about her ideas.

09:29.830 --> 09:32.614
Well, you've come
to the right place.

09:32.615 --> 09:37.133
If you've got a problem, go
to the guy with the brains.

09:37.134 --> 09:39.191
I made it for the Zalien movie.

09:39.192 --> 09:41.412
Try some.

09:44.498 --> 09:46.830
Mmm! Good brain.

09:46.831 --> 09:51.974
It's the cinnamon. Totally
masks the taste of pig liver.

09:51.975 --> 09:53.835
Ugh!

09:54.101 --> 09:56.208
Anyway, what should
I do about Ally?

09:56.209 --> 09:59.051
It's simple in the game of love,

09:59.052 --> 10:02.424
one must yield to the whims
of their significant other.

10:02.425 --> 10:05.852
- Huh?
- Dude, just compromise.

10:05.853 --> 10:08.911
Compromise. I can do that.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.256
Thanks for the advice.

10:10.257 --> 10:12.324
Oh, and if you ever find
yourself in trouble,

10:12.325 --> 10:16.987
you can't go wrong with a
cute pet name, Tiger Pancake.

10:16.988 --> 10:20.048
Don't do that again.

10:24.237 --> 10:26.338
So, let's give this song a shot.

10:26.339 --> 10:29.375
Okay. I still think it
should be a sad ballad

10:29.376 --> 10:31.377
about the challenges
Butch and Bitey face

10:31.378 --> 10:36.382
as they escape the pound and pursue
their dreams of opening a taco truck.

10:36.383 --> 10:38.155
What do you think?

10:38.156 --> 10:40.183
Well, uh...

10:40.184 --> 10:44.088
One should yield to the whims
of their significant other.

10:44.089 --> 10:46.625
Dude, just compromise.

10:46.626 --> 10:48.460
Uh...

10:48.461 --> 10:51.471
I really like your idea.

10:51.472 --> 10:54.460
Let's just go with
that, my little...

10:54.461 --> 10:56.921
Goose Pickle.

10:57.404 --> 10:58.537
Sorry.

10:58.538 --> 11:01.240
Austin, I don't want
to "just do that".

11:01.241 --> 11:04.577
We're partners. I want
to hear your ideas too.

11:04.578 --> 11:09.181
Well, I've been riffing on something
a little more fun and rocking.

11:09.182 --> 11:11.483
<i>Butch scratches all day
and itches all night.</i>

11:11.484 --> 11:14.286
<i>Because Bitey lives on his
butt and he loves to bite.</i>

11:14.287 --> 11:16.087
<i>Ow!</i>

11:16.978 --> 11:18.993
What do you think?

11:18.994 --> 11:21.034
Well...

11:21.194 --> 11:26.949
Just go with the flow and
everything will work itself out.

11:26.950 --> 11:28.499
Your idea's great too.

11:28.500 --> 11:31.537
- Yes.
- My little...

11:31.538 --> 11:34.058
Cute nickname.

11:34.238 --> 11:36.218
Sorry.

11:36.917 --> 11:39.211
Why don't we use both our ideas?

11:39.212 --> 11:40.379
We could write a funny...

11:40.380 --> 11:41.628
- And sad...
- But upbeat...

11:41.629 --> 11:43.878
- Yet sentimental...
- Song about the hilarity...

11:43.879 --> 11:48.387
- And tragedy...
- Of living on a dog's butt.

11:48.388 --> 11:50.488
Perfect.

11:59.060 --> 12:01.200
We only have one Zalien
head to blow up,

12:01.201 --> 12:03.938
so we gotta test the explosion
on something else first.

12:03.939 --> 12:07.367
I filled all these up with
exploding capsules, and brain goo.

12:07.368 --> 12:11.377
Great! Let's blow something up then finish
shooting the last part of the scene.

12:11.378 --> 12:13.006
Yes!

12:13.007 --> 12:15.437
I hope you put enough
capsules in that pineapple.

12:15.438 --> 12:17.347
There's gotta be
brains everywhere.

12:17.348 --> 12:20.147
This isn't the first time
I've blown up tropical fruit.

12:20.148 --> 12:23.884
I totally ruined my
cousin's wedding yesterday.

12:23.885 --> 12:29.285
You gotta shake it to activate
the exploding capsules.

12:29.608 --> 12:33.208
We should be safe back here.

12:35.028 --> 12:38.908
You think that explosion was big enough
to get us into the "Zaliens" premiere?

12:38.909 --> 12:41.789
- Woo!
- Oh, yeah.

12:49.579 --> 12:52.483
Whoa. Look at all this stuff.

12:52.484 --> 12:55.249
I can't believe we're
pitching a song for a movie.

12:55.250 --> 12:58.084
I'm just glad we were able to
compromise and finish the song.

12:58.085 --> 13:00.462
Yeah, me too.

13:00.463 --> 13:02.491
It's good, right?

13:02.492 --> 13:04.592
Totally.

13:04.598 --> 13:08.735
- Should we listen to it one more time?
- Yeah.

13:08.736 --> 13:12.129
<i>I'm a dog and you are a flea.</i>

13:12.130 --> 13:15.790
<i>But we get along like family.</i>

13:17.051 --> 13:20.286
<i>Butch scratches all day
and itches all night.</i>

13:20.287 --> 13:24.617
<i>Because Bitey lives on his
butt and he loves to bite.</i>

13:24.618 --> 13:26.418
<i>Ah!</i>

13:27.340 --> 13:30.557
- The song's terrible!
- I know.

13:30.558 --> 13:35.178
We're about to pitch
the worst song ever.

13:42.920 --> 13:46.483
We've never written a song this bad.
How did this happen?

13:46.484 --> 13:48.330
I should have told you I
never liked your idea,

13:48.331 --> 13:51.094
but I didn't say anything because I
didn't want to hurt your feelings.

13:51.095 --> 13:53.997
What, you think I'm too
weak to handle criticism?

13:53.998 --> 13:56.440
My best friend is Trish.

13:56.441 --> 13:58.459
Well, why didn't you
say anything to me?

13:58.460 --> 14:02.719
I thought if I called your ideas
childish, it would hurt your feelings.

14:02.720 --> 14:04.404
So you think I'm childish?

14:04.405 --> 14:10.243
Like some kid who laughs at
butt jokes and plays with toys?

14:10.244 --> 14:13.480
No way! This thing's made
fart noises the whole time?

14:13.481 --> 14:16.301
I gotta show Dez!

14:16.520 --> 14:19.700
Because he is childish.

14:20.421 --> 14:22.507
All right, kids.

14:22.508 --> 14:28.053
You've got five minutes to
convince me to use your song.

14:28.054 --> 14:30.154
Wow me.

14:30.647 --> 14:33.069
Before we get to
the song idea...

14:33.070 --> 14:38.438
I just want to say that I personally
responded to the Bitey character.

14:38.439 --> 14:41.183
She can totally take criticism.

14:41.184 --> 14:46.187
When Butch told Bitey he didn't
like her tacos, Bitey didn't cry.

14:46.188 --> 14:49.948
That flea created the secret
salsa that saved the orphanage!

14:49.949 --> 14:54.263
And when salsa gave all
the orphans bad gas...

14:54.264 --> 14:57.390
Butch didn't laugh like
most normal people would

14:57.391 --> 14:59.946
when hundreds of
babies are farting.

14:59.947 --> 15:05.064
He helped take care of them
because he's not a childish dog.

15:05.065 --> 15:06.927
Woof.

15:06.928 --> 15:10.236
Wow. You kids are real cute.

15:10.237 --> 15:14.001
You've got three minutes
and 45 seconds left.

15:14.002 --> 15:17.062
Can I hear the song?

15:21.315 --> 15:23.564
Woo! That scene was amazing!

15:23.565 --> 15:26.786
We're totally gonna win
the Zalien contest.

15:26.787 --> 15:30.784
I know! I've never seen
so much brain goo.

15:30.785 --> 15:34.648
Want to see more brain goo? We never
blew up all this other stuff.

15:34.649 --> 15:37.970
Let's start with the Butch doll. He
had the most exploding capsules.

15:37.971 --> 15:40.491
Let's do it!

15:40.588 --> 15:42.944
Uh, where's Butch?

15:42.945 --> 15:46.667
You don't think Austin and Ally
took him to the pitch, do you?

15:46.668 --> 15:50.443
As long as they don't shake him,
everything's gonna be fine.

15:50.444 --> 15:54.346
Not only is Butch
mature, he's smart too.

15:54.347 --> 15:55.653
He can...

15:55.654 --> 15:58.656
Fetch, sit, roll over.

15:58.657 --> 16:01.897
And drive a taco truck.

16:02.967 --> 16:04.762
Bitey doesn't do any tricks.

16:04.763 --> 16:08.092
Bitey doesn't need any
tricks because she's tough.

16:08.093 --> 16:11.874
Butch can try to shake her off
his back, but she's unshakable.

16:11.875 --> 16:17.775
What does um, any of this have to do with
you two writing a song for my movie?

16:20.064 --> 16:22.622
Butch is starting to think
that running a taco truck

16:22.623 --> 16:27.130
was way easier before he
and Bitey started dating.

16:27.131 --> 16:29.854
Maybe they shouldn't date because
it's making everything weird,

16:29.855 --> 16:33.575
and affecting their songwriting.

16:34.187 --> 16:39.350
Maybe Butch and Bitey should
just go back to being friends.

16:39.351 --> 16:42.171
Give me that dog!

16:42.478 --> 16:45.924
You know, in all of my years
in the cartoon business,

16:45.925 --> 16:51.085
I have never been involved
in such a ridiculous...

16:56.453 --> 16:58.913
Austin, don't shake the...

16:58.914 --> 17:01.554
Ah, never mind.

17:02.382 --> 17:03.938
So...

17:03.939 --> 17:06.939
How'd the pitch go?

17:14.361 --> 17:16.996
Did you see his face?

17:16.997 --> 17:20.232
I couldn't. It was covered
in Zalien brains.

17:20.233 --> 17:22.813
And Butch goo.

17:25.472 --> 17:27.733
I'm really sorry, Austin.

17:27.734 --> 17:31.778
I don't like how things have been different
between us since we've been dating.

17:31.779 --> 17:35.019
I know. I'm sorry too.

17:35.348 --> 17:37.183
It seems like now
that we're a couple,

17:37.184 --> 17:39.992
we're just too afraid to
hurt each other's feelings.

17:39.993 --> 17:43.222
- You're right.
- You know I don't think you're weak.

17:43.223 --> 17:45.722
And I don't think
you're childish.

17:45.723 --> 17:50.943
You don't have to say that.
I'm totally childish.

17:51.925 --> 17:54.070
I really wanted this to work.

17:54.071 --> 17:57.551
Me too. More than anything.

17:57.555 --> 18:01.307
I just think being together is
getting in the way of us being us.

18:01.308 --> 18:04.838
Things were great
the way they were.

18:04.839 --> 18:09.879
Maybe we're not ready to
be a couple just yet.

18:09.980 --> 18:12.080
Friends?

18:12.526 --> 18:15.526
And partners. Always.

18:20.631 --> 18:22.551
Uh...

18:25.332 --> 18:28.399
This is just as friends, right?

18:28.400 --> 18:31.520
Yeah. Just as friends.

18:33.585 --> 18:37.027
Okay, but don't let go just yet.

18:37.028 --> 18:39.968
I wasn't going to.

18:46.086 --> 18:48.846
Dinner is served.

18:54.261 --> 18:56.181
Whoa.

19:04.337 --> 19:08.417
Did we really order
this much food?

19:10.754 --> 19:14.174
I think that's everything.

19:18.018 --> 19:19.779
Oh, can we get some ketchup?

19:19.780 --> 19:22.960
It's in my other hat.

19:26.160 --> 19:28.553
This place is way more fun
when you're not on a date.

19:28.554 --> 19:31.794
And totally not awkward.

19:34.681 --> 19:38.281
Okay, still a little awkward.

19:40.022 --> 19:44.058
- Guys, we have great news.
- Oh, are you guys on a date?

19:44.059 --> 19:47.094
No. We decided we're not
gonna do that for now.

19:47.095 --> 19:49.843
We're back to just us being us.

19:49.844 --> 19:51.960
And we're really happy.

19:51.961 --> 19:56.444
As long as you guys are happy and
paying for our dinner, I'm happy too.

19:56.445 --> 20:00.107
Well, I'm not happy about it. It's gonna
take me forever to get over this.

20:00.108 --> 20:03.394
- Tell them about the contest!
- Oh, yeah! We won!

20:03.395 --> 20:05.328
We're going to the
"Zaliens" premiere.

20:05.329 --> 20:06.436
- Woo!
- That's so cool.

20:06.437 --> 20:10.817
- Congratulations.
- Show them the video.

20:14.155 --> 20:17.191
Gorlot, give me the
Kanthian Crystal.

20:17.192 --> 20:18.906
Never, Xantu!

20:18.907 --> 20:23.287
Then say good-bye to
your Zalien spawn!

20:23.823 --> 20:25.627
My babies!

20:25.628 --> 20:28.448
Zalien brain suck!

20:29.890 --> 20:31.690
Ah!

20:39.285 --> 20:42.294
No one eats my babies...

20:42.295 --> 20:44.395
But me.

20:54.035 --> 20:55.443
Ready to finish
shooting the scene?

20:55.444 --> 21:00.604
Ooh, I can't. I'm late
for my cousin's wedding.

21:02.229 --> 21:05.091
I hope you put enough brain...
one more time...

21:05.092 --> 21:09.772
Woo! That was amaze...
one more time sorry.

21:10.918 --> 21:14.700
- Austin, don't shake the...
- My hands stuck on the door.

21:14.701 --> 21:16.825
Austin whatever you do don't...

21:16.826 --> 21:21.319
I'm sorry can we do
that one more time?
