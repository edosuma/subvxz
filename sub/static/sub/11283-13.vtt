00:42.109 --> 00:45.210
¶ If you count all my mistakes ¶

00:45.212 --> 00:49.314
¶ I would have to walk away ¶

00:49.316 --> 00:56.121
¶ I just could not take
another yesterday ¶

00:56.123 --> 01:00.125
¶ I've not the strength
to fade away ¶

01:00.127 --> 01:03.195
¶ Hey, hey... ¶

01:03.197 --> 01:06.598
¶ Now if I admit defeat ¶

01:06.600 --> 01:10.469
¶ Tell me, what then
will that mean? ¶

01:10.471 --> 01:14.139
¶ Will I cease to be? ¶

01:14.141 --> 01:17.142
¶ Or will I be redeemed? ¶

01:17.144 --> 01:19.545
(indistinct talking)

01:19.547 --> 01:20.546
Word up!

01:20.548 --> 01:21.547
WORDY:
Eddie!

01:21.549 --> 01:23.248
Big day.
ED:
Study hard?

01:23.250 --> 01:24.366
What's that thing called?

01:24.367 --> 01:25.483
Yeah, yeah, the
long metal thing.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.586
Loud noises...
SPIKE:
Gun!

01:27.588 --> 01:30.322
See? Why do we
have to requalify?

01:30.324 --> 01:31.323
Hey, hey.

01:31.325 --> 01:32.324
Donna.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.726
Edward.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.127
You guys ready to get
your butts kicked?

01:35.129 --> 01:36.829
Your team's playing
the bad guys?
Yeah.

01:36.831 --> 01:39.098
Let me get this right: Team
three against Team One?

01:39.100 --> 01:40.099
Yeah, that's right.

01:40.101 --> 01:41.233
Team Three against Team One?

01:41.235 --> 01:42.267
Yeah. Go suit up.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.268
And, uh...

01:43.270 --> 01:44.887
What's going on?

01:44.888 --> 01:46.505
Commander Holleran wants to
see you in the briefing room.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.407
Okay.
I'll see you out there.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.577
PARKER: That's not what
we talked about.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.512
And if you knew it
was going this way,

01:53.514 --> 01:55.380
you could've told me
before today, Commander.

01:55.382 --> 01:57.549
Could've told you what?
What's going on?

01:57.551 --> 01:59.885
We've got somebody else to do
your team's psychological

01:59.887 --> 02:01.520
evaluation this year.

02:01.521 --> 02:03.154
What do you mean?
The boss does the psych eval.

02:03.157 --> 02:04.990
We need someone
more objective.

02:04.991 --> 02:06.824
Objective?
Your team's had
a lot of tough calls.

02:06.827 --> 02:07.759
That's the job.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.595
Twice as many traumatic calls

02:09.597 --> 02:10.646
as any other team.

02:10.647 --> 02:11.696
We need to see if
there are any

02:11.699 --> 02:13.132
weak links, stress fractures...

02:13.134 --> 02:14.533
Excuse me?

02:14.535 --> 02:15.834
I'm gonna be in
the room, Eddie.

02:15.836 --> 02:16.835
Right, Commander?

02:16.837 --> 02:17.836
You'll observe.

02:17.838 --> 02:20.239
Observe?
Donna Sabine's gonna

02:20.241 --> 02:22.841
run your team through
tactical requalification.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.243
I drill my own team.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.878
She's gonna run you
through the shoot house,

02:25.880 --> 02:27.312
test your team's skills,

02:27.314 --> 02:29.214
and then break you
down individually.

02:29.216 --> 02:30.682
Okay. What the
hell's going on?

02:30.684 --> 02:31.750
Thank you,
Commander.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.619
Come on.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.654
You knew about this.

02:35.656 --> 02:36.755
Just take it easy.

02:36.757 --> 02:39.224
We've got nothing
to worry about.

02:39.226 --> 02:41.460
DONNA:
Okay, you got 90 seconds

02:41.462 --> 02:43.495
upon entry to
clear the building.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.696
90 seconds?

02:44.698 --> 02:46.181
Yeah. Does that
worry you, Spike?

02:46.182 --> 02:47.665
Spending a little too
much time in the truck?

02:47.668 --> 02:49.368
No, I mean, 90 seconds--

02:49.370 --> 02:51.637
I'm gonna have to bring a book
or a magazine or something.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.605
All right, you got any
more surprises for us?

02:53.607 --> 02:55.240
Of course. Think this was
a pony ride?

02:55.242 --> 02:56.708
Let's do it.
Okay, five minutes.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.810
Gear up, figure
out a tac plan.

02:58.812 --> 03:01.647
Guys? 90 seconds?
Spike, that's what the
cross training's for.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.515
Standard test's
three minutes.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.317
What's going on? Why is
Donna running this?

03:05.319 --> 03:06.818
Yeah, why we got outsiders
running the psych test?

03:06.820 --> 03:08.253
Yeah. That's a
good question.

03:08.255 --> 03:09.872
Do you know
who's doing it?
Time and place.

03:09.873 --> 03:11.490
Let's focus.
Okay, they're
gonna be looking

03:11.492 --> 03:13.525
for two entry teams, we
are gonna give them three.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.960
They're going to be
glued to the doors;

03:14.962 --> 03:16.595
we are going to
take the windows.

03:16.597 --> 03:17.930
So Spike, Wordy:
Black Bravo Two.

03:17.932 --> 03:19.831
Jules, Sam:
Black Bravo One.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.800
We'll go in
with hooks.

03:21.801 --> 03:23.768
Boss and I'll take the
back door, we need you guys

03:23.771 --> 03:25.370
to clear and
cover our entry.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.371
Copy that.

03:26.373 --> 03:27.472
And remember, slow is smooth,

03:27.474 --> 03:28.507
smooth is fast...

03:28.509 --> 03:30.642
ALL:
Fast is lethal!

03:49.296 --> 03:50.862
ED: Let's set the hooks
room by room,

03:50.864 --> 03:52.364
and watch your blind spots.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.333
We'll link up second floor.

03:57.338 --> 04:00.372
Blocks on point,
cover with rifles!

04:00.374 --> 04:03.442
Sam, Jules, let's go!

04:03.444 --> 04:05.544
(grenade explodes)
Bravo Two, hard
entry, more grenades!

04:05.546 --> 04:08.347
Hit 'em hard,
smoke 'em out!

04:08.349 --> 04:09.648
Let's go!

04:10.451 --> 04:11.683
(grenade explodes)

04:11.685 --> 04:13.318
Break your wing, eyes left.
I'm on point.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.419
Sam, Word, cover us.

04:14.421 --> 04:15.921
They're gonna be
stacked at the door.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.390
Go, go, go, let's move!
Show them how it's done!

04:27.568 --> 04:28.634
(gunshots)

04:30.037 --> 04:31.036
One down.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.904
Sam's on his way.

04:42.283 --> 04:43.715
20 seconds from entry.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.952
Spike, cover me from a window.

04:51.825 --> 04:54.726
ED:
Sam, we are in position.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.762
PARKER:
Sam, talk to us.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.870
SAM:
There's one on the door.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.805
(alarm blaring)

05:06.807 --> 05:07.906
(gunshots)

05:07.908 --> 05:08.907
SAM:
Two down!

05:08.909 --> 05:11.076
ED:
Number three down!

05:11.078 --> 05:14.012
PARKER:
40 seconds left.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.615
SAM:
Jules, basement.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.417
PARKER:
Stay alert!
Two targets left.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.354
(gunshots)

05:22.356 --> 05:23.388
Flash bang and cover fire?

05:23.390 --> 05:25.424
I don't like the
percentages.

05:51.618 --> 05:53.685
Who's first?

05:53.687 --> 05:55.087
Listen, uh...

05:55.089 --> 05:56.521
Second thoughts?

05:56.523 --> 05:58.357
No.

05:58.359 --> 06:00.425
You mean yes.

06:00.427 --> 06:02.427
(gunfire)
SPIKE: We're in!

06:04.398 --> 06:07.632
Team One! He's shooting
through the roof!

06:07.634 --> 06:09.401
Your four!

06:09.403 --> 06:10.969
You're worried
about my reputation.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.938
There's gotta be
a good reason to--

06:12.940 --> 06:17.642
I know. There's gotta be a good
reason to break up a team.

06:19.446 --> 06:20.579
(gunfire)

06:25.386 --> 06:27.886
Sam!
No joy!

06:27.888 --> 06:32.391
SPIKE: I see him! I got him!
Wordy? Last target's yours.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.426
Gun!

06:34.428 --> 06:36.395
Oh!

06:36.397 --> 06:37.429
Cut the sound!

06:37.431 --> 06:39.498
(alarm stops)

06:39.500 --> 06:41.800
Three seconds left. Nice.

06:41.802 --> 06:42.801
Who was that?

06:42.803 --> 06:43.969
Uh, that was me.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.504
I got your
back, buddy.

06:45.506 --> 06:46.438
Let's go, guys.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.472
(whooping)

06:47.474 --> 06:48.940
Good work, everyone!

06:48.942 --> 06:49.941
Yeah!
Team One!

06:49.943 --> 06:50.976
I had you pinned.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.010
For about two seconds.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.645
An extra set of
eyes on the roof,

06:53.647 --> 06:54.880
you would've seen the shooter.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.281
It's a risky call, to
split the team in three.

06:56.282 --> 06:57.681
(cell phone rings)
Gotta do what
you gotta do.

06:57.684 --> 06:58.850
WORDY:
Good job, guys.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.018
Hey.
Hey.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.820
JULES:
That was awesome, you guys.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.155
Okay, yeah.
Got it.

07:03.157 --> 07:06.158
DONNA: Hey, Winnie,
do you know who it is?

07:06.160 --> 07:08.660
Okay.

07:08.662 --> 07:09.828
Wordy, you're up.
Psych eval.

07:09.830 --> 07:12.731
I'm coming
with you.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.466
ED:
So who's it gonna be?

07:14.468 --> 07:15.467
Larry Toth?

07:15.469 --> 07:16.935
Are you kidding me?

07:16.937 --> 07:19.438
Why, you know him?
Boss, you know who
it was going to be?

07:19.440 --> 07:21.606
Holleran told me when
you walked in, Eddie, yeah.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.575
This was supposed to be
a routine requalify.

07:23.577 --> 07:24.576
SAM:
Who's Toth?

07:24.578 --> 07:25.577
Military psychologist.

07:25.579 --> 07:26.778
ED:
He breaks up teams.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.046
He does not break up teams.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.448
Oh, come on.

07:29.450 --> 07:30.482
He's a specialist
in team psychology.

07:30.484 --> 07:31.917
We've had some tough calls.

07:31.919 --> 07:33.585
And you're on
board with this?
Like I said, Eddie,

07:33.587 --> 07:34.920
I didn't know it was Toth
before this morning.

07:34.922 --> 07:36.238
I'm gonna be in the
room with you,

07:36.239 --> 07:37.555
we got nothing to
worry about, all right?

07:37.558 --> 07:38.557
Yeah.

07:38.559 --> 07:39.558
You ready?

07:39.560 --> 07:41.126
Ready.

07:45.499 --> 07:46.531
Do the next drill?

07:50.204 --> 07:51.203
PARKER:
Dr. Toth.

07:51.205 --> 07:53.071
Oh, you're
Sergeant Parker.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.806
Yes, sir.
This is Kevin Wordsworth.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.041
People call
me Wordy.

07:56.043 --> 07:58.510
Nickname. Nice.
Means you're liked.

07:58.512 --> 08:01.780
Wordy, why don't you
have a seat over here?

08:01.782 --> 08:02.881
What's this?

08:02.883 --> 08:03.882
TOTH:
Polygraph.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.517
I can see that,
what for?

08:05.519 --> 08:06.818
Lie detector?

08:06.819 --> 08:08.118
Well, think of it
as a stress detector.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.788
That's pretty old school.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.223
Digital detectors
have no charm.

08:11.225 --> 08:13.492
These two have been
with me for a long time.

08:13.494 --> 08:14.559
Wordy, do you mind?

08:14.561 --> 08:15.827
Raise your arms,
would you?
Yeah.

08:17.231 --> 08:19.731
The other one's
for you, Sergeant.
Really?

08:19.733 --> 08:21.633
I'll monitor your reactions
as I talk to your team.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.602
Have a seat.

08:28.275 --> 08:30.609
ED:
Let's go! Let's go, go, go!

08:30.611 --> 08:33.144
How'd they do on the CQB?

08:33.146 --> 08:34.546
They did great.

08:34.548 --> 08:36.081
Individual
testing's next.
Good.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.650
DONNA: I was on this team
when Jules was sidelined.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.552
They've been through
a lot, but...

08:40.554 --> 08:42.354
it doesn't get much
better than them.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.155
I'm not the one who ordered
the outside psych evaluation.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.625
What do
you mean?

08:46.627 --> 08:47.792
Just what I said.

08:47.794 --> 08:49.594
I wasn't the one
who ordered it.

08:49.596 --> 08:51.162
Who did?

08:52.599 --> 08:53.665
(click)

08:55.536 --> 08:57.636
TOTH:
We have a baseline.

08:57.638 --> 08:58.904
Great.
We're going to do

08:58.906 --> 09:00.605
some word association.
Mm-hmm.

09:00.607 --> 09:02.574
First word that comes
to you, no thinking.
Sure.

09:02.576 --> 09:05.644
And I'm going to throw
in some other questions.
Again, no thinking.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.546
No thinking. No problem.

09:07.548 --> 09:09.147
Orange.

09:09.149 --> 09:09.915
Citrus.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.016
Shampoo?
Conditioner.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.284
Coffee.
Double-double.

09:12.286 --> 09:14.085
What did you have for
breakfast this morning?

09:14.087 --> 09:16.755
Uh... what...

09:16.757 --> 09:18.273
Coffee?

09:18.274 --> 09:19.790
C-- Double-double.
I mean, yeah.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.326
TOTH:
What else?

09:21.328 --> 09:23.328
Uh, what do
you mean?
For breakfast.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.198
You seem a little distracted.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.633
Maybe I need another coffee.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.635
Do you sometimes find it
hard to concentrate?

09:30.637 --> 09:31.636
No.

09:38.278 --> 09:41.079
Gun range scores.
Your practice records.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.681
Your marksmanship
is declining.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.683
Could we stick
to the psych eval?

09:44.685 --> 09:47.686
That's what we're doing.
I haven't had as
much time to shoot.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.621
You've been putting in
<i>more</i> time on the range.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.022
PARKER: Wordy's
strength is entry.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.991
He meets his
marksmanship requirements.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.092
A team is...

09:54.094 --> 09:56.628
A team is the sum of its parts.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.630
Yes, I know that,
Sergeant.

09:58.632 --> 09:59.798
Is that your signature?

09:59.800 --> 10:01.266
Yeah.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.667
And is that your signature?

10:02.669 --> 10:03.668
Yeah.

10:03.670 --> 10:05.170
It's getting smaller.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.422
Huh.

10:07.423 --> 10:09.673
Have any simple manual tasks
become more of a challenge?

10:09.676 --> 10:11.242
No.
Do you find yourself
unaccountably

10:11.244 --> 10:13.311
impatient or irritable?
No.

10:13.313 --> 10:16.281
Do you sometimes have trouble
remembering ordinary words?

10:17.384 --> 10:19.651
When was the last time
you had a full medical?

10:19.653 --> 10:20.819
My last medical
was fine.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.787
When was it?
Two years ago.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.659
Maybe three.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.794
I'd like you to raise your hands

10:29.796 --> 10:31.062
like this for me.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.297
Geez, what are you doing?

10:32.299 --> 10:33.665
You're here to
observe, Sergeant.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.734
Are you aware that you
raised your left hand

10:35.736 --> 10:37.636
faster than your
right hand?
No.

10:37.638 --> 10:38.737
Any sleep
disorders, insomnia?

10:38.739 --> 10:40.405
No.

10:40.407 --> 10:41.973
You're thinking.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.743
Let's try that again.

10:44.745 --> 10:45.744
Roses?

10:45.746 --> 10:47.245
Um, bouquet.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.246
Wine.
Bottle.

10:48.248 --> 10:49.664
Your hands.

10:49.665 --> 10:51.081
Any sleep disorders?

10:51.084 --> 10:52.083
No.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.284
Lower your arms.

10:53.286 --> 10:56.921
How do you explain your
trouble with concentration?

10:56.923 --> 11:00.125
Your unsteady hands, your
slower cognitive response?

11:00.127 --> 11:01.760
I sleep fine.
I'm tired.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.728
I have a two-and-a-half
year old, I mean...

11:03.730 --> 11:05.296
Let's try that again.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.632
You're a little tired,
because...

11:07.633 --> 11:09.967
Because Ally keeps waking us up
in the middle of the night.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.803
Again? Because...

11:11.805 --> 11:14.673
Because sometimes it takes
a while to get to sleep.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.675
Why? Things going
through your mind?

11:16.677 --> 11:17.676
Yeah,
I guess.

11:17.678 --> 11:18.677
About work?

11:18.679 --> 11:19.678
Yeah, maybe.

11:19.680 --> 11:20.745
Maybe?

11:20.747 --> 11:21.746
Look, it's nothing.

11:21.748 --> 11:22.881
It's just, it's Shel,

11:22.883 --> 11:25.116
it's, it's the girls,
it's just money.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.786
That's a lot to cope with, a
job, three kids, a mortgage.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.238
Yeah, it is.

11:29.239 --> 11:30.689
But that's not really
what concerns me.

11:30.691 --> 11:33.291
Do you want to know
what concerns me?

11:33.293 --> 11:34.726
Raise your arms again.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.961
This job is the only
thing I know how to do.

11:36.963 --> 11:39.030
Raise your arms.

So what did Holleran tell you?

12:17.237 --> 12:19.304
Nothing.
(cell phone rings)

12:19.306 --> 12:22.173
Just talking results
on the CQB.
What else?

12:22.175 --> 12:24.209
Hold on. Yeah.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.211
I'll send him up.

12:26.213 --> 12:29.414
Spike! You're up.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.849
You're not telling me something.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.083
You've been edgy all day.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.752
Something<i> you're </i>
not telling<i> me?</i>

12:38.959 --> 12:40.959
What's up with him?

12:40.961 --> 12:42.427
SAM:
He's been like that all week.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.162
You know why?

12:45.031 --> 12:46.364
No.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.333
What is it?

12:50.170 --> 12:52.036
Sophie gave him an ultimatum.

12:52.038 --> 12:53.505
With the baby coming,

12:53.507 --> 12:56.508
he's got to make a choice
between SRU and the family.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.052

Wordy!

13:08.054 --> 13:09.320

13:09.322 --> 13:11.022
Wordy!
What?

13:11.024 --> 13:13.091
How'd it go?
Fine.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.261
Commander.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.229
What are you doing here, Ed?

13:18.231 --> 13:20.231
We need to talk.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.132
TOTH:
Rain.

13:27.941 --> 13:28.940
Girlfriend.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.241

13:30.243 --> 13:32.010
Bomb.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.211
(explosion)

13:35.348 --> 13:36.414
Bomb.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.482
Job.

13:40.921 --> 13:43.188
Critical Incident 1137.

13:43.190 --> 13:46.324
Am I supposed to
word associate that?

13:46.326 --> 13:49.327
Multiple bombs
across the city.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.562
You want to
tell me about it?

13:50.564 --> 13:52.430
You got the file.

13:52.432 --> 13:53.798
You got the transcript.

13:53.799 --> 13:55.165
You got the voice recording.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.935
I've got the facts.

13:56.937 --> 14:00.004
It's your experience
of them I need.

14:00.006 --> 14:02.907
1:37, Officer Scarlatti
directs Officer Lou Young

14:02.909 --> 14:04.576
to approach third bomb.

14:04.578 --> 14:10.315
Scarlatti, 1:43-- "Okay, Lou,
three garbage bags.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.016
Anything rigged if they move?"

14:13.486 --> 14:16.187
Okay, Lou, you said
three garbage bags?

14:16.189 --> 14:17.288
Anything rigged if they move?

14:17.290 --> 14:19.023
No visible booby
traps; no wiring.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.809
Okay, that's good.

14:20.810 --> 14:22.594
So you get those garbage
bags out of the way, okay?

14:22.596 --> 14:24.062
Take it real slow.

14:24.064 --> 14:26.331
Make sure they don't
touch the device.

14:31.938 --> 14:35.073
Okay.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.542
I've got 360 access
to the device.

14:37.544 --> 14:38.610
(click)

14:41.081 --> 14:42.213
Guys.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.615
What is it?

14:43.617 --> 14:45.984
Lou.

14:48.255 --> 14:50.388
I think I just
stepped on a land mine.

14:50.390 --> 14:55.260
SPIKE: <i> The bomb was</i>
<i> booby-trapped with a CR-38.</i>

14:55.262 --> 14:58.663
It's a Russian
bounding mine.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.398
And then what happened?

15:00.400 --> 15:02.300
Why are we doing this?

15:02.302 --> 15:04.135
Scarlatti, 2:52--

15:04.137 --> 15:07.272
"Why is everyone standing
around? Let's go!"

15:10.944 --> 15:13.044
SPIKE: Why are you all just
standing there? Let's go!

15:13.046 --> 15:15.146
I said we need a shield.
We need water, okay?

15:15.148 --> 15:17.315
We're gonna do
a weight transfer.

15:17.317 --> 15:18.316
Spike.

15:18.318 --> 15:19.250
Yeah, buddy?

15:19.252 --> 15:20.251
Lou!

15:20.253 --> 15:22.587
It's gonna be okay.

15:24.391 --> 15:26.424
Lou?

15:26.426 --> 15:27.692
(click)

15:27.694 --> 15:30.662
(explosion)

15:38.305 --> 15:41.506
He thought that trying
the weight transfer

15:41.508 --> 15:44.409
would, uh, take us both down.

15:46.212 --> 15:48.046
So, uh...

15:48.048 --> 15:50.248
But you didn't think so.

15:54.988 --> 15:57.088
You're not over it.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.290
What do you think, hmm?

15:59.292 --> 16:01.559
What's the machine telling you?

16:01.561 --> 16:04.095
I'm sorry, but with all due
respect, what's the point?

16:04.097 --> 16:06.431
Huh? Boss?

16:06.433 --> 16:08.099
Doc.

16:08.101 --> 16:10.435
You feel guilty?
Yeah, I feel guilty.

16:10.437 --> 16:13.171
How do you feel now
when you get a bomb call?
Larry, stop it.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.707
We're all open to talking here,
but you're picking at scabs--

16:15.709 --> 16:17.175
Sergeant, keep your
comments to yourself!

16:17.177 --> 16:19.610
This is emotional
manipulation.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.181
TOTH:
You lost a partner.

16:23.183 --> 16:26.250
You lost a best
friend, too, right?

16:26.252 --> 16:29.304
Let me ask you this:

16:29.305 --> 16:32.357
You lose your best friend.
It's 3:00 in the afternoon.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.325
How do you spend
the rest of your day?

16:34.327 --> 16:35.326
We debriefed.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.394
After that.

16:36.396 --> 16:37.662
That's personal.

16:37.664 --> 16:42.000
How well you handle
this job is personal.

16:42.002 --> 16:44.369
I went home.

16:50.443 --> 16:53.011
Mikey.

16:54.447 --> 16:55.480
(speaking Italian)

16:55.482 --> 16:58.082
(Spike sobbing)

16:58.084 --> 17:00.351
Mikey!

17:00.353 --> 17:02.787
TOTH:
<i> You live with your mother.</i>

17:02.789 --> 17:05.289
I live with my parents.

17:11.231 --> 17:12.263
(Michelina

17:12.265 --> 17:15.400
I got it! I got it!

17:15.402 --> 17:18.136
(speaking Italian)

17:18.138 --> 17:19.570
SPIKE: I got it,
I got it, I got it, Ma!

17:19.572 --> 17:21.239
<i> Basta!</i>

17:21.241 --> 17:23.708
Every day, this is my life.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.077
Waiting for the phone to ring.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.478
The officer at
the door, eh?

17:27.480 --> 17:29.380
You bring this into our house.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.249
Pa, I don't think
now is the time, okay?

17:31.251 --> 17:32.250
Sit down, please...

17:32.252 --> 17:33.384
Every day, you go out there,

17:33.386 --> 17:34.819
and you, you play the hero.

17:34.821 --> 17:38.122
Play? What, you think
this is a game?

17:38.124 --> 17:41.092
Today your friend dies,
tomorrow, my son dies.

17:41.094 --> 17:42.360
One day we all die, okay?

17:42.362 --> 17:43.895
(frustrated howl)

17:43.896 --> 17:45.429
At least you try and
make it mean something!

17:45.432 --> 17:46.497
Pa!

17:47.467 --> 17:48.833
(Michelina screams)

17:51.571 --> 17:54.572
You patch things up
with your father?
No.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.107
Why not?
Because he won't.

17:56.109 --> 17:58.342
Why?
He's sick.

17:58.344 --> 17:59.343
Sick?

17:59.345 --> 18:00.344
He's dying.

18:00.346 --> 18:02.580
Spike...

18:02.582 --> 18:05.416
That's why you won't
patch things up?

18:05.418 --> 18:07.552
No, he won't patch things
up until I quit this job.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.754
Until I quit SRU.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.561
Look, we've always run
on transparency here.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.529
No politics, no...
Ed!

18:18.531 --> 18:19.797
If you're gunning to
take my team apart,

18:19.799 --> 18:21.299
then you owe me
a reason why.

18:21.301 --> 18:22.467
This is not just about you.
(phone ringing)

18:22.469 --> 18:23.734
Then who's it about?

18:23.736 --> 18:25.169
You are outta line.

18:25.170 --> 18:26.603
Sir, you are not
answering the question.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.056
I told you, your team is--

18:28.057 --> 18:29.507
WINNIE:
Ed!
Winnie, not now!

18:29.509 --> 18:32.643
Ed, it's Sophie.
She just went into labor.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.835
Soph, I'm sorry.

18:40.836 --> 18:42.386
I was in the shoot house,
I missed the calls.

18:42.388 --> 18:45.590
Okay-- How far apart?

18:45.592 --> 18:47.225
Okay, how long?

18:47.226 --> 18:48.859
Okay. No, Sophie--
Of course I'm coming.

18:48.862 --> 18:50.628
Okay. Bye,
I love you.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.130
HOLLERAN:
Ed?

18:52.132 --> 18:53.564
You heard that, right?
My wife's in labor?

18:53.566 --> 18:55.274
That's great, but
I can't let you go--

18:55.275 --> 18:56.983
I'm gonna requalify later.

18:56.984 --> 18:58.692
Without you being here,
today's tests are meaningless!

18:58.693 --> 19:00.401
That makes no sense.
This is not about
individual performance.

19:00.406 --> 19:01.873
This is about the
fabric of the team.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.341
What are
you saying?

19:03.343 --> 19:04.509
The team configuration's
being tested.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.144
So we reschedule!

19:06.146 --> 19:08.813
Dr. Toth has a limited
window of availability.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.481
Great. Get somebody else.
Can't be done, and
if you don't requalify,

19:11.484 --> 19:15.286
I am not authorized to
clear Team One for duty.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.421
She just started
labor, right?

19:17.423 --> 19:20.224
About an hour ago.
Well, you'll be there

19:20.226 --> 19:22.493
in plenty of time.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.629
We'll get you in
and out. One hour.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.564
I know this is
asking a lot.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.533
Okay.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.068
Okay?

19:30.069 --> 19:31.602
ED:
One hour, and I'm gone.
(phone rings)

19:31.604 --> 19:34.505
I need to establish
a baseline for you.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.674
Tell me three
truths, and a lie.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.310
In that order.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.945
My name's Julianna Callahan.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.681
I'm 36.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.683
I'm from Medicine Hat, Alberta.

19:45.685 --> 19:46.717
And I love quilting.

19:49.822 --> 19:50.821
Thank you, Julianna.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.623
Now some word association.

19:52.625 --> 19:53.691
Stream of consciousness.

19:53.693 --> 19:54.692
That's right.
That's left.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.260
You started without me.

19:56.262 --> 19:57.428
Try to keep up.

19:58.798 --> 19:59.797
Country.
Horizon.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.332
Sky.
Sunrise.

20:01.334 --> 20:02.533
Bedtime.
Story.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.534
Sam Braddock.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.776
What do you want to know?

20:13.279 --> 20:14.412
(sighs)

20:14.414 --> 20:16.547
My name is Sam Braddock.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.683
I have two sisters.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.651
I served in the military.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.787
I like the mellow
sounds of easy rock.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.890
Good.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.225
Word association.

20:27.227 --> 20:28.626
Friend.
Trust.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.466
Hand.
Touch.

20:35.468 --> 20:36.367
Grip.
Seize.

20:40.506 --> 20:41.572
(Spike screams)

20:44.344 --> 20:45.643
Wordy!

20:48.715 --> 20:51.015
Come on. Let's go, man.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.721
I'd like to pick up on
the sensitive circumstances

20:56.723 --> 20:58.589
of your departure from the
Special Operations forces

20:58.591 --> 21:01.092
in Afghanistan.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.594
I fired the fatal shot during
an incident of friendly fire.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.263
I haven't made a secret of it.

21:05.265 --> 21:09.634
I see Sam's application into
Team One was processed quickly.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.902
He was fast-tracked, yes.

21:11.904 --> 21:15.673
SRU teams generally select
their new members as a group.

21:15.675 --> 21:19.610
I gather the decision in
Sam's case was more top-down.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.379
That's right.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.548
How did the team
respond to that?

21:24.550 --> 21:26.751
Sam had our full support.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.586
Why don't you
just tase his ass?

21:28.588 --> 21:30.588
Muscle spasm, he'll
pull the trigger.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.790
So we go in
hard tactical.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.959
There's something I
need you to do.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.494
All right, see
these stairs, here?

21:36.496 --> 21:37.628
That's where we
came in, right?

21:37.630 --> 21:39.630
Need you to make
reverse entry.

21:39.632 --> 21:40.865
Go across this hallway,
these doors here,

21:40.867 --> 21:42.500
I need you to
go through them.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.368
Now be careful,
because that is a big road.

21:44.370 --> 21:45.603
I want you to cross it.

21:45.605 --> 21:47.672
I want you to make an
entry into this Timmy's.

21:47.674 --> 21:48.706
I'll have a
double-double.

21:48.708 --> 21:49.707
ED:
Jules?

21:49.709 --> 21:50.708
Cream, no sugar.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.576
ED:
Spike?
Nah, I'm good.

21:52.578 --> 21:55.780
And we responded with
courtesy and professionalism.

21:55.782 --> 21:57.381
Why did your father have to

21:57.383 --> 21:59.617
intervene personally to
facilitate your entry?

21:59.619 --> 22:01.519
Ask my father.

22:01.521 --> 22:03.454
Ask Commander Holleran.
It was between them.

22:03.456 --> 22:04.955
It was General Braddock
who forced him here

22:04.957 --> 22:06.657
after leaving Special
Ops under a cloud?

22:06.659 --> 22:08.492
SAM:
There was no "cloud."

22:08.494 --> 22:10.628
And I wasn't forced.

22:11.764 --> 22:14.665
The Strategic Response Unit:

22:14.667 --> 22:18.669
"Connect, Respect, Protect,"
talk before tactics.

22:18.671 --> 22:22.973
Curious career choice
for a military man.

22:22.975 --> 22:25.676
Darren Kovacs.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.812
Ex-hockey player
back from Afghanistan.

22:27.814 --> 22:31.515
Decides to protect the Godwin
Coliseum from demolition.

22:31.517 --> 22:32.717
Single-handed.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.354
This is something
we can work through.

22:36.356 --> 22:38.956
You just have to...
you just have to trust

22:38.958 --> 22:40.691
that we can get
through this, okay?

22:40.693 --> 22:41.992
I'm a good soldier.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.561
I needed you

22:43.563 --> 22:44.729
to know that.

22:44.731 --> 22:46.864
Oh, I know that, buddy, I...

22:46.866 --> 22:48.566
You just got to stay
with me, okay?

22:48.568 --> 22:49.834
Please stay with me.

22:49.836 --> 22:52.870
See you on the other side.

22:53.439 --> 22:54.905
(gunshot)

23:02.882 --> 23:07.618
Why did you do that?

23:07.620 --> 23:09.687
He wasn't gonna shoot.

23:10.857 --> 23:13.958
Could've stuck it out.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.893
Huh?

23:15.895 --> 23:18.929
You weren't
gonna shoot, were you?

23:25.104 --> 23:27.705
He wasn't gonna shoot.

23:28.808 --> 23:31.041
He wasn't gonna shoot!

23:32.445 --> 23:34.845
TOTH:
<i> Did he say he was quitting?</i>

23:34.847 --> 23:36.614
Yes, he did say
he was quitting.

23:36.616 --> 23:37.748
But everybody
has those days.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.717
We showed him
that he was wrong

23:39.719 --> 23:41.552
and that he belonged.

23:41.554 --> 23:42.520
We never

23:42.522 --> 23:43.621
doubted that.

23:43.623 --> 23:44.789
Did you fight

23:44.791 --> 23:46.457
to keep him close
for personal reasons?

23:46.459 --> 23:48.692
Say what you're saying, Doc.

23:48.694 --> 23:50.861
(panting)

23:50.863 --> 23:53.464
(grunting)

23:53.466 --> 23:54.832
DONNA:
3:02, Wordy.

23:54.834 --> 23:57.101
(grunting)

23:57.103 --> 23:58.469
3:08, Spike. Not bad.

23:58.471 --> 24:00.171
Yeah, those last ten
seconds weren't mine.

24:00.173 --> 24:01.739
What are you talking
about, Spike?

24:01.741 --> 24:02.873
Nothing, Ed.

24:02.875 --> 24:03.974
ED:
Spike.
Nothing.

24:04.911 --> 24:06.510
What?
Would it have

24:06.512 --> 24:08.746
killed you, Word?
I was right there,
three feet away.

24:08.748 --> 24:11.482
What do you mean?
I helped you over.
Yeah, you thought

24:11.484 --> 24:12.817
about it a good,
long time first.

24:12.819 --> 24:14.441
It's individual scores.

24:14.442 --> 24:16.064
I still helped you
over the top of that climb.

24:16.065 --> 24:17.687
First you give me
this, and then you
think about helping me

24:17.690 --> 24:19.190
while we're
on the clock.
Hey, come on.

24:19.192 --> 24:20.758
How did I give you that?

24:20.760 --> 24:22.226
I didn't even
touch you.

24:22.227 --> 24:23.693
What the hell are you
worried about, anyway?

24:23.696 --> 24:24.895
You're gonna be fine.

24:24.897 --> 24:25.863
Spike.

24:25.865 --> 24:27.031
It's true.

24:27.033 --> 24:28.566
CSIS wants you;
everybody wants you.

24:28.568 --> 24:30.501
You could pick up and
leave whenever you want.

24:30.503 --> 24:32.503
I got one place
where I belong,

24:32.505 --> 24:33.604
and that's here.

24:33.606 --> 24:35.039
I don't have your choices.

24:35.041 --> 24:36.106
I've got a family.

24:36.108 --> 24:38.709
Okay, look, nobody's
going anywhere.

24:40.847 --> 24:42.413
You okay?
Yeah.

24:42.414 --> 24:43.980
I don't think it's right
they're making you stay.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.850
All right, what's next?
Let's get through this.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.268
Sorry.
Yeah, whatever.

24:47.269 --> 24:48.685
TOTH:
<i> Have you ever witnessed</i>
<i> any friction</i>

24:48.688 --> 24:49.887
<i> within the team?</i>

24:49.889 --> 24:51.589
All families have friction.

24:51.591 --> 24:54.124
Is this a family or a SWAT team?

24:57.630 --> 24:59.063
Critical Incident

24:59.065 --> 25:01.065
1077.

25:01.067 --> 25:03.567
Knife call, two women,
alleged infidelity.

25:03.569 --> 25:05.769
Callahan, 11:06--

25:05.771 --> 25:06.837
"Boss, threat is low.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.072
I can do this."

25:08.074 --> 25:09.707
Callahan-- "Boss, threat is low.

25:09.709 --> 25:11.509
I can do this.
I see access."

25:11.511 --> 25:12.743
Braddock-- "She wants the truth.

25:12.745 --> 25:13.811
"She's responding.

25:13.813 --> 25:15.413
Give me a shot."

25:15.414 --> 25:17.014
It was a risk either way.
I had eyes in.

25:17.016 --> 25:19.016
<i> There was time to get in.</i>
<i> The knife was down.</i>

25:19.018 --> 25:20.251
And then the
hostage escalated.

25:20.253 --> 25:21.652
JULES:
<i> Which she wouldn't have</i>

25:21.654 --> 25:23.020
<i> if we'd already gone in.</i>

25:23.022 --> 25:24.989
11:09 a.m.,
Alpha One and Two,

25:24.991 --> 25:26.957
<i> explosive entry</i>
<i> through Black Charlie Three.</i>

25:26.959 --> 25:28.659
SAM:
<i> I had to come in.</i>

25:28.661 --> 25:30.127
She did not need to
be subdued by force.

25:30.129 --> 25:32.046
"Subject was lying prone

25:32.047 --> 25:33.964
<i> on the floor,</i>
<i> a knife wound to the chest."</i>

25:33.966 --> 25:36.083
We know, Jules; we were there.

25:36.084 --> 25:38.201
11:17. "Subject in critical
condition taken to hospital."

25:38.204 --> 25:39.603
We were there.

25:39.605 --> 25:42.206
It was a tough call.
It was tough because...?

25:42.208 --> 25:43.974
We were making
split-second decisions,

25:43.976 --> 25:45.943
and there was no easy
right or wrong.

25:45.945 --> 25:47.978
And because
in the midst of all this,

25:47.980 --> 25:49.547
you and Jules Callahan
were involved.

25:49.549 --> 25:50.881
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.283
My personal notes
on my team

25:52.285 --> 25:54.552
are confidential.
Well, technically,

25:54.554 --> 25:56.020
no, they're not patients.

25:57.089 --> 25:59.790
Yes, we were seeing each other.

25:59.792 --> 26:03.260
Two weeks after that argument,
Callahan was shot.

26:03.262 --> 26:05.729
The two of you had
been working together.

26:05.731 --> 26:06.697
Where is he?

26:06.699 --> 26:08.098
ED:
It's a decoy. Fall back.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.833
Fall back now. Take cover!

26:09.835 --> 26:11.135
(gunshot)

26:17.977 --> 26:19.910
Officer down!
Officer down!

26:19.912 --> 26:21.078
Medic up now!

26:21.080 --> 26:22.212
Jules has been hit!

26:22.214 --> 26:24.315
Stay with me, Jules.
(gasping)

26:24.317 --> 26:26.317
Stay with me.

26:26.319 --> 26:28.285
(gasping)

26:28.287 --> 26:30.821
She was shot by a sniper
half a mile away.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.990
That would've happened
whether I was there or not.

26:32.992 --> 26:36.327
How did it feel seeing her shot?

26:36.329 --> 26:38.362
Not great.

26:38.364 --> 26:41.265
(quietly):
I should have protected you.

26:47.306 --> 26:50.674
Is that when you knew
Sam Braddock and Jules Callahan

26:50.676 --> 26:51.976
were romantically
involved?

26:51.978 --> 26:54.244
When Jules was ready
to return to the team,

26:54.246 --> 26:55.846
their relationship was over.

26:55.848 --> 26:57.214
Did you know the
risk to the team?

26:57.216 --> 26:59.016
Yes, I knew
the risk to the team.

26:59.018 --> 27:00.685
That's why I broke it off.

27:00.686 --> 27:02.353
Listen, I worked my ass
off to earn a spot

27:02.355 --> 27:05.089
on Team One, and I worked
twice as hard to get it back.

27:05.091 --> 27:06.290
Would you have continued

27:06.292 --> 27:08.092
the relationship
secretly if you could?

27:09.862 --> 27:12.129
(sighs)

27:12.131 --> 27:13.397
Yes.

27:13.399 --> 27:15.766
There's a reason that's
against SRU policy.

27:15.768 --> 27:17.067
It puts your teammates
in danger.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.335
But it makes
no difference,

27:18.337 --> 27:19.970
because it's over.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.739
We're colleagues now.

27:21.741 --> 27:24.141
That is it.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.945
The Priority of
Life code-- you're
familiar with it?

27:27.947 --> 27:29.046
Yes, I'm familiar with it.

27:29.048 --> 27:30.681
You rescue hostages first.

27:30.682 --> 27:32.315
Then officers,
then subjects.
Then officers, then subjects.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.318
Would you break
the Priority of Life code

27:34.320 --> 27:36.086
to save the life
of Sam Braddock?

27:43.929 --> 27:45.996
How'd it go?

27:47.099 --> 27:48.999
Not good.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.135
Me, neither.

27:51.137 --> 27:54.071
He gave me a hard time
'cause of you.

27:54.073 --> 27:56.073
Yeah.

27:56.075 --> 27:58.175
They have us under
a microscope

27:58.177 --> 28:00.244
just in case we treat
each other any different.

28:00.246 --> 28:03.313
What's it gonna take?

28:03.315 --> 28:05.416
A chaperone?

28:10.056 --> 28:13.157
That's the thing, Sam,
it's not gonna go away.

28:19.432 --> 28:22.099
Did you know about
the relationship
before Jules was shot?

28:22.101 --> 28:23.867
You knowingly put
them in danger.

28:23.869 --> 28:25.436
That relationship is over.

28:25.438 --> 28:27.004
The mere mention
of each other's name triggers

28:27.006 --> 28:28.172
stress reactions.
You know what, you read

28:28.174 --> 28:29.173
a lot into stress reactions.

28:29.175 --> 28:30.374
Braddock and Callahan

28:30.376 --> 28:32.109
clearly still have
feelings for each other.

28:32.111 --> 28:33.744
Yes, of some kind.
Which they value,

28:33.746 --> 28:35.379
it seems, more than
their own team's security.

28:35.381 --> 28:36.914
They both have cause

28:36.916 --> 28:38.148
to be expelled from SRU,

28:38.150 --> 28:41.452
as do you--
for turning a blind eye.

28:41.454 --> 28:43.387
You're getting a kick
out of this, aren't you, Doc?

28:43.389 --> 28:45.789
I save lives my way.

28:45.791 --> 28:48.392
It's your way that seems
to be the problem.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.402
Ed Lane.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.070
Team leader.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.972
Born in Scarborough.

29:01.974 --> 29:04.374
We love Dr. Toth.

29:09.148 --> 29:12.082
Think you might have a problem
with your machine there, Doc.

29:12.084 --> 29:14.952
Humor's an effective way
to deflect apprehension

29:14.954 --> 29:16.487
or anxiety.

29:16.489 --> 29:18.388
That's very perceptive.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.023
Mind if I call you Larry?

29:20.025 --> 29:22.092
Sure.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.194
How's your home life?

29:24.196 --> 29:25.796
Well, Larry,
my wife is in labor,

29:25.798 --> 29:27.030
and I'm here, so you tell me.

29:27.032 --> 29:28.532
Eddie...

29:28.534 --> 29:30.934
Ed, what are you doing here?
You got to go.

29:30.936 --> 29:33.070
Sooner I get this done,
the sooner I get there.

29:33.072 --> 29:35.405
Doc, he's got to go.

29:35.407 --> 29:38.509
Ed... that says a lot,
your choice to stay here.

29:38.511 --> 29:40.544
Thanks. I won't
keep you long.

29:40.546 --> 29:44.314
Word association--
no thinking.

29:44.316 --> 29:45.549
Scorpio.

29:45.551 --> 29:47.050
Solution.
DONNA:
<i> Ready.</i>

29:47.052 --> 29:48.819
Three, one, two,

29:48.821 --> 29:50.788
four!

29:52.124 --> 29:52.890
Apple.

29:52.892 --> 29:53.791
Core.

29:53.793 --> 29:54.792
And...

29:54.794 --> 29:56.293
one, four, three, two!

30:00.299 --> 30:01.064
Pancake.

30:01.066 --> 30:02.032
Syrup.

30:02.034 --> 30:03.500
Three, one, three, two!

30:05.905 --> 30:06.804
Bull's-eye.

30:06.806 --> 30:07.971
Brainstem.

30:07.973 --> 30:09.907
Four, two, three, one!

30:15.114 --> 30:17.147
Let me see.

30:20.820 --> 30:22.486
It was jammed.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.588
Go again.

30:25.524 --> 30:27.858
Three, two,
four, one!

30:29.829 --> 30:31.528
You're good.

30:32.832 --> 30:34.398
Whipped cream.
Cherry.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.200
Goran Tomasic.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.603
Had it coming.

30:40.573 --> 30:42.606
His son, Petar,

30:42.608 --> 30:44.842
what did he
have coming?

30:44.844 --> 30:45.943
Stop, stop, stop.
<i> Tata!</i>

30:45.945 --> 30:47.277
Hey, hey, hey!
Easy, easy.

30:47.279 --> 30:48.345
<i> Tata!</i>

30:48.347 --> 30:51.315
(shouting in Croatian)

30:51.317 --> 30:52.950
(yells)

30:52.952 --> 30:54.435
Scorpio.

30:54.436 --> 30:55.919
Hey, hey, hey,
runner!

30:55.921 --> 30:58.255
JULES (over radio):
Ed, the boy!
(gunshot)

30:58.257 --> 31:01.325
(distant, distorted siren wails)

31:04.864 --> 31:06.930
(panting)

31:13.272 --> 31:14.605
Jackson...

31:14.607 --> 31:16.273
Barcliffe, recovered addict.

31:16.275 --> 31:18.175
Wrong place,
wrong time.

31:18.177 --> 31:22.145
Put himself in the line of fire
to save an undercover cop.

31:23.883 --> 31:26.049
All the lives you can't save.

31:26.051 --> 31:28.518
What do you do

31:28.520 --> 31:30.921
<i> with the guilt? </i>
EMT!

31:30.923 --> 31:33.424
Get me an EMT!

31:33.425 --> 31:35.926
<i> All those times</i>
<i> your best wasn't good enough.</i>

31:35.928 --> 31:37.494
I gotcha, buddy. I gotcha.

31:37.496 --> 31:39.897
The paramedics are just
around the corner. Gotcha.

31:39.899 --> 31:41.031
You're gonna be okay.

31:41.033 --> 31:42.933
You're okay.
(weakly):
Ella...

31:42.935 --> 31:45.269
Who's Ella?
Who's Ella, Jackson?

31:46.238 --> 31:47.604
Jackson?

31:47.606 --> 31:51.008
<i> All the times</i>
<i> you were too late.</i>

31:52.244 --> 31:54.244
Ed, you're a sniper.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.213
I know you can regulate
your breath and heart rate,

31:56.215 --> 31:58.215
mask your responses.

31:58.217 --> 32:01.652
But your skin conductivity
is telling another story.

32:03.589 --> 32:05.689
Even heroes crack.

32:05.691 --> 32:07.925
Let's talk about

32:07.927 --> 32:09.993
your mentor, Danny.

32:12.665 --> 32:14.965
All I see are
the ghosts.

32:14.967 --> 32:18.035
I can't take it anymore.

32:18.637 --> 32:20.971
Eddie...

32:21.941 --> 32:23.540
Please...

32:24.510 --> 32:27.945
please help me.

32:27.947 --> 32:30.247
Pull the plug.

32:30.249 --> 32:32.215
Okay, Wordy.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.619
Now!

32:38.590 --> 32:41.158
Okay.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.527
I get it.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.366
I get it.

32:50.536 --> 32:53.103
You know what, buddy?

32:53.105 --> 32:56.073
(panting):
Every time...

32:56.075 --> 32:58.709
every time I look
in a damn scope...

33:00.546 --> 33:04.014
I see a kid run across...

33:04.016 --> 33:07.217
I see a spray of blood...

33:07.219 --> 33:10.053
(panting)

33:10.055 --> 33:12.589
You know what else, Danny?

33:13.759 --> 33:16.626
You know what else I see?

33:18.030 --> 33:21.665
All the calls we
didn't get to in time.

33:21.667 --> 33:24.368
You're not the only one
who sees ghosts, Danny.

33:24.370 --> 33:26.003
(moans quietly)

33:26.005 --> 33:27.704
And I got
to tell you,

33:27.706 --> 33:30.474
I don't know where
to put 'em anymore, either.

33:30.476 --> 33:32.642
Eddie, please, no.

33:32.644 --> 33:35.679
You taught me everything I know.

33:38.117 --> 33:40.751
You made me who I am, Danny.

33:42.354 --> 33:47.057
You can't, you can't tell me...

33:47.059 --> 33:49.059
that this is how it ends.

33:49.061 --> 33:51.061
(sobbing)

33:51.063 --> 33:52.696
You can't.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.798
Give me the gun.

33:54.800 --> 33:58.368
(sobbing)

33:58.370 --> 34:01.338
No...

34:01.340 --> 34:05.208
It's gonna be okay.

34:05.210 --> 34:08.145
PARKER:
Where are you going
with this one, Doc?

34:08.147 --> 34:09.479
Ed saved Danny's life.

34:09.481 --> 34:11.815
When things get tough
at work, where do you turn?

34:11.817 --> 34:13.683
I count on my team.
Where do you turn

34:13.685 --> 34:15.752
if it's something
you can't share with the team?

34:24.096 --> 34:25.495
My family.

34:25.497 --> 34:27.497
Your family
keeps you grounded.

34:27.499 --> 34:29.800
You can't be the kind of cop
you have to be

34:29.802 --> 34:31.769
if you're not grounded.

34:31.770 --> 34:33.737
Your family knows you,
warts and all.

34:33.739 --> 34:36.740
They're there for you.

34:36.742 --> 34:39.109
But what gets you
through the tough calls, Ed,

34:39.111 --> 34:42.245
the lives you couldn't save,
the people you had

34:42.247 --> 34:44.748
to kill, the guilt?

34:44.750 --> 34:47.250
My family.

34:47.252 --> 34:49.453
So how are you coping
with them gone?

34:49.455 --> 34:51.822
How do you know that?

34:51.824 --> 34:53.423
Beside the point.

34:53.425 --> 34:55.592
I work 12-hour shifts.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.661
I train 14 hours a week
on top of that

34:57.663 --> 34:59.129
so that I don't cost
somebody a life,

34:59.131 --> 35:00.614
so I don't let my team down.

35:00.615 --> 35:02.098
And you're saying what,
that I am not a good enough cop

35:02.101 --> 35:04.134
because I am not more
of a family man, is that it?

35:04.136 --> 35:05.802
I don't care what kind
of family man you are.

35:05.804 --> 35:07.838
I care whether or not
you can cope with the job,

35:07.840 --> 35:08.839
for your team's sake.

35:08.841 --> 35:10.373
It's a question of balance.

35:10.375 --> 35:11.374
Of balance?

35:11.376 --> 35:12.576
You try telling that to a guy

35:12.578 --> 35:14.411
with a gun to his head,
to a kid on a ledge.

35:14.413 --> 35:15.946
What do you want me to say here?

35:15.947 --> 35:17.480
"Sorry about your luck,
I got to get home for dinner"?

35:17.483 --> 35:18.782
Is that it?
I get that.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.984
That's good.

35:20.985 --> 35:23.185
Now, you tell Holleran
to stay out of my family life.

35:23.188 --> 35:25.222
It's not Commander Holleran.

35:28.861 --> 35:30.861
Greg...

35:30.863 --> 35:34.231
how did he know
that Sophie left me?

35:34.233 --> 35:35.732
How'd he know about that?

35:37.703 --> 35:39.703
I didn't trust myself
to be objective, Eddie,

35:39.705 --> 35:40.804
as a colleague

35:40.806 --> 35:43.590
or as a friend.

35:43.591 --> 35:46.375
For the sake of the team...
For the sake of the team?

35:46.378 --> 35:47.477
As a friend?

35:47.479 --> 35:50.647
Eddie, Eddie, you tell me.

35:51.884 --> 35:53.183
You tell me.

35:53.185 --> 35:54.618
You said it
yourself.

35:54.620 --> 35:56.820
What should I do
when there's lives on the line?

35:56.822 --> 35:58.288
You know what?

35:58.290 --> 36:00.157
Gentlemen...

36:02.161 --> 36:03.360
I got a baby I got to meet.

36:03.362 --> 36:04.861
Eddie.

36:14.339 --> 36:15.338
Ed.

36:15.340 --> 36:16.840
Nothing to say
right now, boss,

36:16.842 --> 36:18.942
I got to go.

36:18.944 --> 36:21.211
What's going on?

36:30.455 --> 36:32.522
DONNA:
Okay,

36:32.524 --> 36:34.457
I'm done.

36:34.459 --> 36:36.493
(sighs)

36:36.495 --> 36:38.728
Not an easy
process.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.363
Could say that.

36:40.365 --> 36:42.365
DONNA:
Holleran didn't
bring him in.

36:42.367 --> 36:44.301
I'm sure he was going
to tell you that.

36:44.303 --> 36:46.536
We know it was the boss.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.738
He was just doing what he thinks
is best for the team.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.740
What are we supposed
to do now?

36:50.742 --> 36:52.475
You go home.

36:52.477 --> 36:54.477
We'll let you know
how this shakes out.

36:59.251 --> 37:01.251
PARKER:<i> I needed</i>
<i> an objective point of view,</i>

37:01.253 --> 37:03.220
I needed fresh eyes
on my people.

37:03.222 --> 37:04.454
I didn't need you
to break them down.

37:04.456 --> 37:05.822
Your instinct
was right.

37:05.824 --> 37:07.891
There are fault lines running
all through this team.

37:07.893 --> 37:09.759
What you call fault lines--
that's them being human.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.795
It's natural that you're
feeling guilty and protective.

37:11.797 --> 37:13.108
We had a record number

37:13.109 --> 37:14.420
of high-risk calls
the past two years.

37:14.421 --> 37:15.732
I know your team's numbers.
SRU marksmanship

37:15.734 --> 37:17.768
is 30% higher
than any other officers'

37:17.769 --> 37:19.803
on the force to begin
with...
And it takes five
different fingers

37:19.805 --> 37:21.238
to form a fist.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.239
I'm not disputing that.

37:22.241 --> 37:24.241
These guys chose
each other.

37:24.243 --> 37:25.742
They've got
each other's back.

37:25.744 --> 37:26.977
You didn't bring
in an outsider

37:26.979 --> 37:28.812
because you're
worried about them.

37:28.814 --> 37:31.548
You brought an outsider in

37:31.550 --> 37:33.583
because you're
worried about you.

37:34.553 --> 37:36.953
They need a sergeant,

37:36.955 --> 37:39.889
not a friend, not a father.

37:39.891 --> 37:42.659
But you know
that, right?

37:43.595 --> 37:46.029
Give me half an hour.

37:46.031 --> 37:49.266
We'll meet with your
commander, okay?

Okay, Clark, put your mom on.

Yeah, put her on right now.
