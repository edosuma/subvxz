WEBVTT

00:11.764 --> 00:14.165
Seals picked this guy up out of Kabul.

00:14.233 --> 00:19.704
Name is Omar Abdul Hassan Assad
Abad Ali Shahid Mohammed.

00:19.772 --> 00:21.939
CIA guys couldn't get
anything out of him.

00:21.973 --> 00:23.807
They said you were our best bet.

00:30.014 --> 00:32.048
You know who I am, don't you?

00:32.082 --> 00:34.684
So you know what I'm gonna do if
you don't tell me what I need to

00:34.718 --> 00:35.251
know.

00:35.286 --> 00:37.121
You do not scare me!

00:37.155 --> 00:38.422
Stand him up!

00:42.128 --> 00:43.795
Aah!

00:43.829 --> 00:45.063
Where's the target?!

00:45.097 --> 00:49.200
Allah, make my testicles strong
against the boot of the infid... Aah!

00:49.234 --> 00:50.969
Where is the target?!

00:51.037 --> 00:53.405
My gonads are indestructible.

00:53.473 --> 00:56.476
My penis shaft is strong
like the oak tree.

00:56.510 --> 00:59.145
Tell me...where...the target is!

00:59.213 --> 01:02.316
Tell me...where...
the target... is!

01:02.384 --> 01:03.417
Aah!

01:03.451 --> 01:04.785
His vitals are spiking.

01:04.819 --> 01:05.853
He can't take much more.

01:05.921 --> 01:10.124
We're just getting started.

01:11.226 --> 01:12.827
Agent Flowers, his heart.

01:14.997 --> 01:16.965
No. No.

01:22.205 --> 01:24.305
Wait! Wait a minute!

01:25.441 --> 01:26.841
Okay, look.

01:26.875 --> 01:28.209
Maybe I was being stubborn.

01:28.277 --> 01:29.844
Let's try and talk this out!

01:29.912 --> 01:31.212
Wait! I remember!

01:31.280 --> 01:36.952
The target is...

02:13.758 --> 02:15.860
So, it's true, huh?

02:15.927 --> 02:17.294
You're finally calling it quits.

02:17.362 --> 02:19.931
Yeah.
So now you can stop spying on me.

02:19.998 --> 02:23.001
Well, just because you say
you're retiring doesn't mean

02:23.036 --> 02:23.936
you're retiring.

02:24.004 --> 02:28.007
Could be like Jay-Z and come back,
like, a couple of months later.

02:28.041 --> 02:29.843
But it is the right thing to do.

02:29.877 --> 02:31.278
You can't fight the future.

02:31.312 --> 02:32.979
Don't waste your life trying.

02:33.014 --> 02:34.982
Oh, and one more thing.

02:35.016 --> 02:37.084
Know how you always say "they"

02:37.119 --> 02:38.720
are coming to get you?

02:38.754 --> 02:41.389
Well, this time, they actually
are coming to get you.

02:41.457 --> 02:42.791
Who?

02:42.825 --> 02:46.094
Central terrorist...
Agency or unit, or...

02:46.162 --> 02:49.164
Come on, I don't know... a
bunch of guys with guns.

02:49.198 --> 02:50.331
Why?

02:50.366 --> 02:52.634
They seem to think you're
a domestic terrorist.

02:52.702 --> 02:54.637
Because you are.
I'm retired.

02:54.705 --> 02:57.373
Why don't you go ahead and
tell them that while they're

02:57.407 --> 02:58.374
waterboarding you?

02:58.409 --> 02:59.743
Is this a trick?

02:59.777 --> 03:00.877
No. A trick is a [bleep]

03:00.912 --> 03:03.881
who'd be out spending
money on these bitches.

03:03.915 --> 03:05.716
This is a warning.

03:12.224 --> 03:13.990
Hey, man, you see my new iPhone?

03:14.025 --> 03:15.825
I got one.
I don't like the [bleep]

03:15.893 --> 03:17.894
I love my iPhone.

03:17.928 --> 03:20.096
This [bleep] can do
anything and everything.

03:20.163 --> 03:23.065
Yeah. Everything except
make a [bleep] phone call.

03:23.100 --> 03:26.168
And on the line right now is
regular caller... I love this

03:26.236 --> 03:29.138
guy... always has some brilliant
insights... Dan Stucky.

03:29.172 --> 03:30.906
Dan, what's pissing
you off today, buddy?

03:30.940 --> 03:32.708
What isn't pissing me off today?

03:32.743 --> 03:34.777
Let's talk about our
president, "Buck Osama."

03:34.811 --> 03:35.978
It's lunacy!

03:36.046 --> 03:38.715
It's like he's declaring
war on rich people.

03:38.783 --> 03:41.085
Right now, you know, I'm a
private security contractor on

03:41.119 --> 03:43.153
the front lines, defending
American freedom, but I got

03:43.221 --> 03:45.356
plans to start my own business,
and I figure to have about

03:45.424 --> 03:46.991
$30 million in the first two years.

03:47.026 --> 03:49.127
Wow! Well, Obama's gonna
kill that $30 million.

03:49.161 --> 03:49.861
Just kill it.

03:49.895 --> 03:52.264
Yeah, he's gonna take it,
redistribute it, and give it to

03:52.298 --> 03:55.233
all those losers who sit around all
day watching tv and getting fat.

03:55.267 --> 03:56.334
Unbelievable, isn't it?

03:56.402 --> 03:59.136
I just heard Obama's passing
legislation that'll let guys who

03:59.170 --> 04:01.238
can't get laid go to your
house and bang your wife.

04:02.240 --> 04:05.975
Dan the security man, as always,
you are right on point.

04:06.010 --> 04:07.310
Always good to hear from you.

04:07.344 --> 04:10.212
Next caller.

04:10.247 --> 04:11.213
Hey, right on time.

04:11.247 --> 04:14.116
It's tweedlee [bleep] dumbass and
tweedlee bigger dumb [bleep] ass.

04:14.150 --> 04:16.152
Today's our last day, Dan.
You gonna miss us?

04:16.219 --> 04:18.755
I just can't wait till we get
this brand-new super [bleep]

04:18.789 --> 04:20.423
fantastic security
system up and running.

04:20.458 --> 04:23.326
Yeah, in 24 hours, the new
system will be online, the

04:23.394 --> 04:26.130
building will reopen, and we
be out your life forever.

04:26.198 --> 04:28.399
You know what keeps this
building secure? Me.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.869
A dedicated, fit, fearless
security-enforcement

04:30.936 --> 04:34.039
professional who can spot a godless
terrorist from a mile away!

04:34.107 --> 04:36.041
Let me see your fancy [bleep]
computer do that.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.310
I think you'll feel
differently tomorrow.

04:38.344 --> 04:43.215
Just make sure you here 24 hours
from now... oh, about... 3:17 P.M.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.685
And watch the magic happen.

04:45.752 --> 04:47.320
Gonna be like you died
and went to heaven.

04:48.322 --> 04:49.389
Hey, do you have an iPhone?

04:49.423 --> 04:52.391
Eat my ass.

04:55.061 --> 04:55.861
I love it.

04:55.895 --> 04:58.930
I got everything I need for this
whole operation right here.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.765
I got my secret plans and maps.

05:00.833 --> 05:03.134
Only problem is it's
so thin, so light.

05:03.202 --> 05:05.904
It could fall out my pocket and I don't
even know the [bleep] happened.

05:05.939 --> 05:08.107
And did you know the screen was
so indestructible, it could stop

05:08.141 --> 05:08.941
a speeding bullet?

05:08.975 --> 05:10.643
can't stop no damn bullet.

05:10.677 --> 05:12.378
It's an iPhone, not the ispyphone.

05:12.412 --> 05:15.113
Okay. Timing mechanism
is functioning.

05:15.181 --> 05:16.315
Everything looks good.

05:16.382 --> 05:18.017
Setting the timer.

05:18.084 --> 05:19.919
I remember when these [bleep]
first came out, man.

05:19.953 --> 05:22.655
Bitches would be coming up to you,
like, "let me see that iPhone.

05:22.690 --> 05:23.623
Let me play with it!

05:23.658 --> 05:24.758
Let me stick it up my ass!

05:24.826 --> 05:26.393
Put it in my mouth!
"Suck on it!"

05:26.428 --> 05:28.396
Then one day, I got tired
of all these questions.

05:28.430 --> 05:29.396
You know what I'm saying?

05:29.431 --> 05:31.265
I let the girl stick the
iPhone up her butt.

05:31.933 --> 05:34.201
Took the doctors 12
hours to get it out.

05:34.235 --> 05:35.202
And you know what?

05:35.270 --> 05:37.271
It was still working.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:50.486 --> 05:51.920
It's good to see you, Jack.

05:51.987 --> 05:52.921
Thank you, director.

05:52.988 --> 05:53.988
How's Tracey?

05:54.022 --> 05:56.824
I remember you two were very
much in love and had your whole

05:56.892 --> 05:58.192
lives ahead of you.

05:58.226 --> 05:59.827
Yes, we were.

05:59.895 --> 06:01.996
Then...

06:04.032 --> 06:05.266
Tracey, wait!

06:05.334 --> 06:06.267
Aah!

06:06.301 --> 06:07.902
Unh!

06:07.970 --> 06:09.370
Tracey!

06:09.405 --> 06:10.838
Oh [bleep] That's bad.

06:10.906 --> 06:12.973
Yes, she died very violently, sir.

06:13.008 --> 06:15.643
After some time passed, I was
engaged to a very special woman

06:15.710 --> 06:17.278
named Eleanor.

06:17.313 --> 06:21.148
Then...
Catch, Agent Flowers!

06:21.183 --> 06:25.986
Aah! Aah!

06:26.021 --> 06:28.689
Eleanor!

06:28.723 --> 06:30.257
Holy [bleep] That's bad.

06:30.324 --> 06:31.992
I thought I would never love again.

06:32.026 --> 06:33.661
Then I met Taquanda.

06:33.728 --> 06:34.795
Taquanda?

06:34.829 --> 06:36.430
Yes, sir. Taquanda.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.631
Then...
Unh!

06:38.699 --> 06:40.801
No.
Jack, get this [bleep]

06:40.868 --> 06:42.636
What you standing
there for [bleep] it!

06:42.704 --> 06:43.704
Do something!

06:44.773 --> 06:48.175
Jack Flowers, you
worthless white [bleep]

06:48.243 --> 06:51.980
Taquand-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a!

06:52.014 --> 06:54.448
That's terrible, Jack.

06:54.483 --> 06:55.984
He tied her to a missile?

06:56.018 --> 06:59.053
What kind of deranged, Wile E.
Coyote [bleep] is that?

06:59.087 --> 07:02.256
Well, I'd love to stand around and
reminisce, but we should get to work.

07:02.324 --> 07:04.792
We followed up on that
"Woodcrest" clue.

07:04.826 --> 07:06.060
Came up with one match.

07:06.127 --> 07:08.863
Domestic terrorist with
radical leftist affiliation.

07:08.897 --> 07:09.864
Name is Huey Freeman.

07:09.898 --> 07:11.800
Homeland wants you to pick him up.

07:11.867 --> 07:14.235
We'll have a field team ready in 20.

07:14.270 --> 07:15.938
Banes, are you sure about this?

07:15.972 --> 07:17.706
Look, I've done bad things in my day.

07:17.740 --> 07:18.707
I've killed people.

07:18.775 --> 07:20.776
I've also kicked a lot
of people in the nuts.

07:20.810 --> 07:22.044
I still hear their screams.

07:22.078 --> 07:22.978
Aah!

07:23.046 --> 07:24.146
Ohh!

07:24.214 --> 07:25.981
My nuts!

07:26.049 --> 07:27.983
But I've never hurt a child.

07:28.051 --> 07:29.618
He's no normal child, Jack.

07:29.686 --> 07:32.220
N.S.A.'S got a file on him
thicker than a Luke dancer.

07:32.254 --> 07:35.023
I don't know if you know
anything about Luke dancers,

07:35.057 --> 07:37.058
Jack, but they're very thick.

07:37.092 --> 07:40.228
Very large thighs and buttocks, Jack.

07:40.296 --> 07:41.930
That's how thick his file is.

07:41.964 --> 07:45.968
If he puts up a fight,
you put him down.

07:50.373 --> 07:51.406
Here's what I'm saying.

07:51.441 --> 07:53.876
I used the recorder app to
dictate the plan into the phone.

07:53.944 --> 07:56.779
I used the aroundme app to find out
the bomb parts and the detonators.

07:56.814 --> 07:58.781
And I used the Amazon app
to price everything out.

07:58.849 --> 08:00.751
Why pay any more than
necessary for C-4?

08:00.785 --> 08:02.219
gonna blow up anyway, right?

08:02.287 --> 08:04.588
Great. Maybe one day they'll
invent an app where you can

08:04.656 --> 08:07.191
actually call some [bleep] body.

08:09.962 --> 08:11.329
Crap.

08:11.397 --> 08:13.098
Great.
It's no problem.

08:13.132 --> 08:14.766
I'll just call my grandfather.

08:14.833 --> 08:16.367
He'll get us a new car.

08:16.402 --> 08:19.003
Now let me just use the GPS
to find out where we are.

08:19.038 --> 08:21.273
We down the street from
your house, asshole.

08:21.307 --> 08:24.676
Look. That's Riley's
house over there.

08:24.710 --> 08:26.211
Yep, that's what the iPhone say.

08:26.245 --> 08:30.749
Will you just please
make the [bleep] call?

08:30.783 --> 08:32.650
I ain't got no [bleep] bars.

08:37.389 --> 08:39.756
Granddad, I know you're
not gonna believe me, but I

08:39.791 --> 08:41.758
think there are government
agents that are coming to...

08:41.826 --> 08:44.761
Shh! Boy, I don't have
time for your crazy bull crap.

08:44.795 --> 08:46.996
I don't like to be bothered when
my "Real Housewives of Compton"

08:47.031 --> 08:47.997
is on!

08:48.032 --> 08:49.799
Oh, no, she didn't.

08:49.833 --> 08:52.936
Ew! Yes, she did.

08:52.970 --> 08:54.805
Damn it! Aah!

08:54.839 --> 08:56.807
Pause it, boy.

08:59.978 --> 09:01.078
Hey, pops!

09:01.113 --> 09:03.081
We need a favor.

09:15.861 --> 09:18.263
And you delivered the final
shipment to the warehouse?

09:18.298 --> 09:20.632
Not yet.
We at the Freemans' right now.

09:20.667 --> 09:22.000
We, uh...blew a tire.

09:22.068 --> 09:24.002
What the hell are you
doing at the Freemans'?

09:24.036 --> 09:26.371
There's federal agents
closing in on that house!

09:26.439 --> 09:28.373
Get to the warehouse now!

09:28.408 --> 09:30.109
Ed, we got to jet.

09:30.177 --> 09:31.644
Show ain't over yet.

09:31.711 --> 09:33.646
Now, Ed.

09:36.883 --> 09:38.717
We got some [bleep] we
got to take care of.

09:38.752 --> 09:40.786
Super-secret-type [bleep]

09:40.821 --> 09:42.087
Ed, come on.

09:42.155 --> 09:43.322
Okay, fellas.

09:43.356 --> 09:45.357
Well, give your granddaddy my best.

09:45.392 --> 09:48.794
Oh, and, uh, I'd stay away from
downtown for quite a while.

09:48.828 --> 09:49.795
Ed!

09:49.863 --> 09:51.897
You should only be going uptown.

09:51.965 --> 09:52.865
Ed!

09:52.899 --> 09:54.634
U-p-t-o-w-n.

09:54.701 --> 09:58.771
Ed!

10:06.847 --> 10:08.047
Aah!

10:08.082 --> 10:10.983
Yes, I did say that I
would tap that ass.

10:11.018 --> 10:12.719
That's what I had to say, nigga.

10:20.127 --> 10:21.961
Federal agents!

10:21.995 --> 10:23.262
Move! Move! Move!

10:28.335 --> 10:30.803
You hoes need to get up off me.

10:30.871 --> 10:32.138
Butler, check in!

10:32.205 --> 10:34.139
Roger that, checking in.

10:37.344 --> 10:39.044
Rest of the house is clear.

10:39.112 --> 10:41.146
Damn it!
C.T.A., this is Flowers.

10:41.213 --> 10:42.480
The package is not here.

10:42.514 --> 10:44.782
I repeat, we did not get the package.

10:44.817 --> 10:46.150
Someone must have tipped him off.

10:46.218 --> 10:47.218
Set up a perimeter!

10:47.252 --> 10:49.153
He's probably still on foot.

10:49.187 --> 10:50.153
Jack, I got something.

10:50.221 --> 10:52.422
Looks like the old man's credit
card was just used to buy a

10:52.456 --> 10:53.323
train ticket online.

10:53.391 --> 10:55.392
I'm guessing our guy is on
his way to the station.

10:55.426 --> 10:56.293
We're on our way.

10:56.327 --> 10:58.695
All units, proceed in the
direction of the train station.

10:58.763 --> 11:01.298
I want this whole place
searched from top to bottom...

11:07.906 --> 11:09.306
Oh, I can't wait.

11:09.341 --> 11:12.944
I can't wait to see what the
white man gonna do to you.

11:13.011 --> 11:14.945
Just drive.

11:17.783 --> 11:21.119
Jack, I got a fast-moving yellow
bus about 3 miles ahead of you.

11:21.153 --> 11:22.320
Looks a little suspicious.

11:22.388 --> 11:25.223
All units, the package is
believed to be on a yellow bus

11:25.290 --> 11:26.290
straight ahead.

11:28.293 --> 11:29.127
Aah! Ohh!

11:29.194 --> 11:29.928
Look, look, look!

11:29.995 --> 11:31.095
Here come the white cavalry!

11:31.130 --> 11:32.930
Oh, they got you now, little nigga.

11:32.965 --> 11:33.998
Try to get the kid alive!

11:34.033 --> 11:36.200
I'm gonna try and get a
clean shot at the driver.

11:37.269 --> 11:38.403
Here he is!

11:38.437 --> 11:41.406
Here he is, Mr. White Man!

11:41.473 --> 11:42.373
Aah! Aah!

11:42.408 --> 11:43.741
Oh, I hate you!

11:43.775 --> 11:45.108
I hate you little nigga!

11:45.977 --> 11:48.011
Keep your foot on the gas!

12:13.138 --> 12:15.740
Take your foot off the gas!

12:17.075 --> 12:21.012
Aaaaaaaaaah!

12:21.046 --> 12:22.380
Oh.

12:29.421 --> 12:31.688
Ohh!

12:46.008 --> 12:48.810
In this footage from yesterday,
the marines subdued

12:48.844 --> 12:53.181
the possible, potential,
alleged suspects.

12:55.952 --> 12:57.186
Do you know who I am?

12:57.220 --> 12:58.087
No.

12:58.121 --> 13:00.356
Well, if you knew who I was,
then you would know what I'm

13:00.390 --> 13:02.825
gonna do with you if you don't
tell me what I need to know.

13:02.892 --> 13:04.727
Maybe.
But I don't know who you are.

13:04.795 --> 13:06.996
Do you know what kind of
damage a steel boot can do to

13:07.064 --> 13:08.797
prepubescent testicles?

13:08.832 --> 13:09.999
How would I know that?

13:10.066 --> 13:13.803
Tell me where the target is
before I kick you in the nuts!

13:13.871 --> 13:15.805
Get your hands off of me!

13:15.840 --> 13:17.140
I'm a proud American!

13:17.175 --> 13:18.075
it!

13:18.142 --> 13:21.244
I knew this great country was
gonna go straight to [bleep] in

13:21.278 --> 13:25.348
a sandwich bag once that bean-pie
chef became commander-in-chief!

13:25.416 --> 13:27.083
Do you want me to kick
you in the nuts?!

13:27.118 --> 13:27.784
No.

13:27.819 --> 13:29.953
Do you want me to kick
you in the nuts?!

13:29.987 --> 13:30.787
No.

13:30.821 --> 13:33.223
Do you want me to... wait, Jack.

13:33.257 --> 13:35.258
I do not want you to
kick him in the nuts.

13:35.292 --> 13:35.792
Why?

13:35.860 --> 13:38.362
He's innocent, but we found
something big at his house.

13:38.429 --> 13:41.265
Or should I say "thin and light"?

13:41.333 --> 13:43.802
This iPhone was found at the
Freeman residence, but it

13:43.869 --> 13:49.041
belongs to an Ed Wuncler III.

13:49.075 --> 13:51.144
Looks like he's the guy
we're looking for.

13:51.178 --> 13:54.214
We found the attack plans,
blueprints, schedule, everything.

13:54.248 --> 13:55.982
According to this, the
target is Wuncler Plaza.

13:56.050 --> 13:56.983
There's something else.

13:57.017 --> 13:59.219
A large shipment of unknown
materials at a warehouse.

13:59.253 --> 14:01.320
It doesn't say anything
about what it might be?

14:01.355 --> 14:04.256
No. But it's definitely
related to today's attack.

14:04.324 --> 14:08.894
We all know what it is
... bionuclear Anthrax.

14:08.961 --> 14:10.895
Bionuclear Anthrax.

14:10.963 --> 14:11.963
All right, let's move.

14:12.031 --> 14:13.030
Call Wuncler Plaza.

14:13.065 --> 14:15.299
Tell them to evacuate the
building immediately.

14:22.341 --> 14:24.943
Jack, I want you to find out
what's in that warehouse and

14:24.978 --> 14:26.945
then go after Ed the III
and his grandfather.

14:26.980 --> 14:28.948
I'll get your field
team in 10 minutes.

14:28.982 --> 14:32.852
Yes, sir.

14:32.887 --> 14:35.790
Look, Huey, I apologize for what
happened in there, but nobody is

14:35.824 --> 14:36.790
above the law.

14:36.858 --> 14:38.425
Wuncler is gonna pay for this.

14:38.493 --> 14:39.760
You have my word.

14:39.794 --> 14:40.861
Excuse me, everyone.

14:40.929 --> 14:42.229
Can I have your attention?

14:42.264 --> 14:45.199
I'm afraid we have to abort the
mission to arrest Ed the III and

14:45.233 --> 14:46.033
his grandfather.

14:46.101 --> 14:48.402
What?! What about the bomb?!
Sorry, Jack.

14:48.436 --> 14:50.405
Turns out some people
are above the law.

14:50.472 --> 14:52.941
The Wunclers will not pay
for what they did today.

14:53.009 --> 14:54.042
You have my word.

14:54.110 --> 14:55.310
Good work, everyone.

14:55.344 --> 14:56.744
Have a good weekend.

14:56.779 --> 14:59.280
And, oh... no going rogue.

14:59.314 --> 15:00.848
I got the tequila.

15:00.882 --> 15:02.383
Who's got the salt?

15:02.418 --> 15:03.317
I'm going rogue.

15:03.385 --> 15:05.954
Huey, you've got to get to
Wuncler Plaza and try to get as

15:06.021 --> 15:07.855
many people out of
there before it blows.

15:07.890 --> 15:10.291
A second ago, you were
gonna kick me in the nuts.

15:10.359 --> 15:12.126
Huey, please, I'm just doing my job.

15:12.161 --> 15:15.030
It's a crappy job, but somebody's
got to kick people in the nuts.

15:15.064 --> 15:18.032
And sometimes you kick the wrong
person in the nuts, and that's tragic.

15:18.067 --> 15:21.036
But now we can both make sure it's
the right set of nuts that get kicked.

15:21.104 --> 15:22.938
You little, black,
communist niglet!

15:23.005 --> 15:24.673
I want to press full charges!

15:24.707 --> 15:27.676
I... [ Gasps ]

15:27.744 --> 15:28.810
Jack Flowers.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.246
You do know who I am, right?

15:30.280 --> 15:31.847
Why... w-w-why, yes, sir.

15:31.881 --> 15:32.915
You Jack Flowers.

15:32.949 --> 15:35.651
You kick them arab terrorist
son-of-a-bitches in the nuts!

15:35.719 --> 15:37.753
You, sir, are an American hero.

15:37.788 --> 15:40.389
Right now, I need you to be
a hero and help Huey get to

15:40.457 --> 15:42.391
Wuncler Plaza before a bomb goes off.

15:42.459 --> 15:43.827
Yes, sir, Mr. sir.

15:43.894 --> 15:44.995
Come on, little nigga!

15:45.029 --> 15:45.929
You heard the man!

15:45.997 --> 15:49.032
Move your little communist ass
so we can save some white folk!

15:58.145 --> 16:00.179
Open the door!

16:00.214 --> 16:02.749
Hey, assholes, building's closed!

16:02.816 --> 16:05.084
Look, we got to get
everybody out of here.

16:05.119 --> 16:06.286
There are bombs in the building.

16:06.320 --> 16:09.188
Ain't nobody in here but me, and
I'm giving the orders around here.

16:09.256 --> 16:11.191
Who the [bleep] are you two?!

16:11.258 --> 16:12.359
Okay, we tried.

16:12.393 --> 16:13.727
Now hush your mouth!

16:13.761 --> 16:15.095
There's a white man talking.

16:15.162 --> 16:16.162
Hey, wait a minute.

16:16.197 --> 16:17.330
You two are the terrorists.

16:17.365 --> 16:19.732
I don't know how you two
escaped, but you two [bleep]

16:19.800 --> 16:22.168
with the wrong
security-enforcement officer.

16:22.202 --> 16:23.803
I ain't going anywhere.

16:26.073 --> 16:27.006
Unh!

16:27.074 --> 16:30.076
And neither are you.

16:49.998 --> 16:50.965
What the...?

16:55.437 --> 16:57.404
Hmm?

17:00.976 --> 17:04.411
Come on! Come on!

17:04.444 --> 17:10.717
I need the password
to unlock the door.

17:10.785 --> 17:13.685
Sir, I was given a
mission by Jack Flowers, the

17:13.721 --> 17:16.622
greatest white man since g.I.
Joe, and that mission is to

17:16.690 --> 17:17.957
get you out of here safely.

17:17.991 --> 17:20.126
Now, what's the password
to open the door?

17:20.160 --> 17:21.327
Eat my ass!

17:21.361 --> 17:24.964
Sir, do not make me use
enhanced interrogation techniques.

17:25.031 --> 17:26.332
Eat my ass!

17:26.398 --> 17:27.398
Aah!

17:27.434 --> 17:28.867
♪ Stomp him in the nuts ♪

17:28.901 --> 17:30.235
Give us the password!

17:30.270 --> 17:31.236
Eat my ass!

17:31.304 --> 17:33.238
Eat my ass!

17:33.272 --> 17:34.339
♪ Stomp him in the nuts ♪

17:34.407 --> 17:35.407
♪ I'm-a stomp him in the nuts ♪

17:35.441 --> 17:37.342
Give us the password!

17:37.410 --> 17:38.877
Ruckus, wait!

17:38.911 --> 17:39.778
Aah!

17:39.845 --> 17:41.680
"Eat my ass."

17:43.049 --> 17:44.049
My God.

17:44.117 --> 17:45.150
What have I done?

17:45.184 --> 17:49.220
Oh, I have seen the
enemy, and it is me.

17:49.255 --> 17:50.421
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

17:50.489 --> 17:51.690
I can't find my iPhone!

17:51.758 --> 17:52.591
I think I dropped it.

17:52.658 --> 17:55.126
Ed, you dropped the
iPhone had everything on it?

17:55.161 --> 17:56.194
What if somebody found it?

17:56.228 --> 17:58.029
They'd know exactly
where... 

17:58.063 --> 18:00.598
Tell me who the man
is on these t-shirts.

18:00.666 --> 18:03.835
He's a dead man just like you!

18:07.940 --> 18:09.540
Oh!

18:13.312 --> 18:15.112
What?! What, huh?!

18:15.147 --> 18:18.315
What?!

18:18.383 --> 18:20.284
Oh, no!

18:20.318 --> 18:21.853
Aah!

18:21.920 --> 18:24.288
Aah!

18:28.194 --> 18:29.294
Wow.

18:29.328 --> 18:33.031
Go ahead, Steve.

18:33.065 --> 18:35.766
I am so sorry, Mr. White Man.

18:35.801 --> 18:38.736
Never again will this
foot touch white nuts.

18:38.770 --> 18:40.738
Ruckus, come on!

18:43.841 --> 18:45.275
We got to go now!

18:45.309 --> 18:46.709
Come on!

18:46.743 --> 18:48.644
Run! Run!

19:10.067 --> 19:11.067
Huey, it's Jack.

19:11.101 --> 19:13.370
Did you get everyone out
of the building in time?

19:13.404 --> 19:15.906
Well, yeah, but
it was just one person.

19:15.940 --> 19:17.708
Meet me at the Wuncler estate.

19:17.742 --> 19:18.808
We're gonna finish this.

19:21.112 --> 19:24.280
These are hard times, and
Americans need inspiration.

19:24.314 --> 19:27.984
People want real life to be like
in the movies, with good guys

19:28.051 --> 19:30.886
and bad guys and black
guys... All that [bleep]

19:30.920 --> 19:35.724
This country needed a rallying cry,
a reminder of why it's great to be American.

19:35.791 --> 19:37.892
So you just make this stuff up?

19:37.960 --> 19:41.697
No! Several overpaid members of
the writers [bleep] Guild of

19:41.731 --> 19:42.965
America make this stuff up.

19:42.999 --> 19:44.266
This is just a joke to you.

19:44.334 --> 19:46.902
We're talking about the lives
of innocent Americans.

19:46.936 --> 19:49.437
Innocent American... Singular.

19:49.472 --> 19:52.440
Daniel Stucky, A.K.A.
Dan the security man.

19:52.474 --> 19:54.875
Have you ever met Dan Stucky, Jack?

19:54.909 --> 19:57.978
He's a [bleep]... A waste
of functioning organs.

19:58.045 --> 20:00.713
But dead, he would have
been a national hero.

20:00.748 --> 20:03.784
We had Dan the security man
action figures, fast-food

20:03.851 --> 20:07.788
tie-ins, video games, a limited-edition
collectible sneaker line.

20:07.822 --> 20:11.792
We had Dan ribbons, Dan buttons,
and Dan ringtones, and a feature

20:11.860 --> 20:13.894
film starring Jack black.

20:13.929 --> 20:15.329
And all he had to do is die.

20:15.397 --> 20:16.230
But why?

20:16.265 --> 20:18.867
Don't you have enough money?

20:18.901 --> 20:22.871
No.

20:22.939 --> 20:24.239
I'm taking you into custody.

20:24.274 --> 20:27.676
You have till the count
of 3, or I will shoot.

20:27.711 --> 20:31.414
1...
More than enough time.

20:31.482 --> 20:35.785
...2...

20:35.820 --> 20:37.254
Huh?
Agent Flowers.

20:37.321 --> 20:39.222
Jack, it's the president.

20:39.290 --> 20:42.958
First of all, I want to
congratulate you on the fine

20:42.993 --> 20:44.760
work you've done today.

20:44.794 --> 20:49.331
But, Mr. President, this man
has conspired to... Yes, sir.

20:49.399 --> 20:51.233
Yes, Mr. President.

20:52.435 --> 20:54.403
You can let yourselves out.

20:56.839 --> 20:59.140
Huey, you did a good thing today.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.409
You saved a man's life.

21:01.444 --> 21:03.144
They don't win until you give up.

21:03.212 --> 21:04.946
They don't win until
you stop fighting.

21:05.014 --> 21:07.115
You can't fight the future.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.384
Don't waste your life trying.

21:09.419 --> 21:10.386
Boy!

21:10.420 --> 21:12.221
Oh, we're so glad you're okay.

21:12.256 --> 21:14.390
I'm so sorry I didn't listen to you.

21:16.126 --> 21:17.193
Back off!

21:17.228 --> 21:19.095
Everyone stay back or he dies!

21:19.129 --> 21:20.830
He-e-e-e-e-lp!

21:20.864 --> 21:22.198
Somebody shoot this [bleep]

21:22.232 --> 21:23.766
You can't do this to me!

21:23.800 --> 21:25.201
Let me go.
You know who I am?

21:25.235 --> 21:26.135
Can't do this!

21:26.169 --> 21:27.303
What are you waiting for?

21:27.338 --> 21:28.471
Shoot him!

21:28.505 --> 21:31.008
Can't do this!

21:39.851 --> 21:41.752
Man, we might
have to think about moving.

21:41.819 --> 21:43.753
This neighborhood ain't'
what it used to be.

21:43.788 --> 21:44.821
Oh, man!

21:44.856 --> 21:48.925
We saw you on the news with all
them marines pointing guns at you.

21:48.992 --> 21:50.359
And you was looking hard, too.

21:50.394 --> 21:52.361
You was like, "What? What?"

21:52.395 --> 21:54.363
Man, Huey, you
were really right this time.

21:54.397 --> 21:56.098
You said it was gonna
happen, and it happened.

21:56.132 --> 21:59.202
Imagine all of the problems we could
avoid if we ever started listening to you.

21:59.236 --> 22:01.204
Oh, well!

22:01.205 --> 22:11.205
