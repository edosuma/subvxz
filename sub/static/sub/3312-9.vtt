WEBVTT

00:07.041 --> 00:09.310
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.343 --> 00:12.480
- ( man laughs )
- COME ON, TRAVIS. IT'S A SILENT AUCTION,

00:12.513 --> 00:15.083
SO I WAS BIDDING ON STUFF.
I WAS HELPING THE CITY.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.518
YOU PAID $200 FOR A
DINNER WITH YOURSELF.

00:17.551 --> 00:20.054
AFTER A HEATED BIDDING WAR...

00:20.088 --> 00:21.522
WITH MYSELF.

00:21.555 --> 00:24.825
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE ONE OF
THOSE LEFTOVER AUCTION ITEMS

00:24.858 --> 00:26.394
THAT'S PATHETIC AT THE END
OF THE NIGHT, YOU KNOW?

00:26.427 --> 00:29.597
IT WOULD HAVE JUST BEEN ME AND THE
RIDE-ALONG WITH THE SANITATION DEPARTMENT.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.465
WELL, I WOULDN'T
CALL THAT PATHETIC.

00:31.499 --> 00:34.068
YOU BOUGHT THAT?!

00:34.102 --> 00:37.205
THEY LET YOU PUSH THE BUTTON
THAT SMASHES EVERYTHING.

00:37.238 --> 00:39.340
YEAH, MONEY WELL SPENT.

00:39.373 --> 00:42.076
WELL, NOW THAT I'VE GOT YOU BACK
HERE AT MY BACHELORETTE LAIR,

00:42.110 --> 00:43.344
LET'S GET DOWN TO IT.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.613
LEFTOVERS! I'M STARVING.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.616
- YEAH, I DIDN'T FIND THAT DINNER THEY PUT OUT VERY...
- EDIBLE?

00:48.649 --> 00:50.484
- THAT'S THE WORD.
- WELL, DON'T WORRY.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.486
I GUARANTEE YOU WILL DO
BETTER HERE TONIGHT.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.355
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, WITH THE FOOD.

00:54.388 --> 00:59.227
OKAY, MOZZARELLA SALAD, SQUASH BLOSSOMS
STUFFED WITH RICOTTA AND HERBS

00:59.260 --> 01:01.095
AND BUTTERMILK FRIED CHICKEN.

01:01.129 --> 01:03.431
WOW, IS THIS ALL HOMEMADE?

01:03.464 --> 01:07.067
YEP, MADE RIGHT HERE IN MY HOME.

01:09.270 --> 01:12.173
MMM, WHAT IS IN THIS BATTER?
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.275
UH, I CAN'T BECAUSE IT'S, UM,

01:14.308 --> 01:16.510
SECRET BATTER STUFF.

01:18.679 --> 01:21.149
MMM, STILL NOT GONNA SAY.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.152
I MIGHT SAY. YOU
SHOULD KEEP TRYING.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.421
MMM, TASTES LIKE CHICKEN.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.625
- I DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU HAD THE TIME TO COOK ALL THIS.
- NEITHER DO I.

01:31.659 --> 01:34.528
- YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE.
- CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT.

01:34.562 --> 01:36.664
- HI!
- HELLO.

01:36.697 --> 01:39.400
OH, TRAVIS, THIS IS JOE.
JOE IS MY...

01:39.433 --> 01:41.435
ALL AROUND, ALL-PURPOSE NANNY

01:41.469 --> 01:43.537
SLASH NOT-CHEF.

01:43.571 --> 01:46.174
OH GOOD, 'CAUSE THERE'S
NOTHING MORE AWKWARD

01:46.207 --> 01:48.542
THAN WALKING IN AND MEETING
YOUR DATE'S HUSBAND.

01:48.576 --> 01:52.146
OR BOYFRIEND. OR THEIR
NAKED MOM IN THE HALLWAY.

01:52.180 --> 01:54.715
TRUST ME... I'VE WALKED IN
ON A LOT OF WEIRD STUFF.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.686
DON'T MIND ME. I JUST CAME DOWN
HERE TO GET SOME LEFTOVERS.

01:58.719 --> 02:01.455
THESE ARE UNBELIEVABLE, AREN'T THEY?
MY COMPLIMENTS TO THE CHEF.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.591
YEAH YEAH, WHAT IS THE SECRET?

02:03.624 --> 02:05.459
WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE SECRET IS, TRAVIS?
I'M GONNA TELL YOU.

02:05.493 --> 02:07.295
- JOE, JOE, JOE...
- NO NO NO, COME ON.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.563
HE DESERVES TO KNOW WHAT THE SECRET IS.
THE SECRET, TRAVIS,

02:09.597 --> 02:11.699
IS, UM,

02:11.732 --> 02:13.301
PAPRIKA.

02:15.336 --> 02:16.704
AND NOW YOU KNOW. PAPRIKA.

02:16.737 --> 02:19.740
YEAH, I GET THE GOOD STUFF FROM...
CANADA.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.612
YEP, SHE'S GOT A MILLION SECRETS
JUST LIKE THAT, TRAVIS.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.480
PAPRIKA GROWN IN...

02:26.514 --> 02:29.217
THE BEAUTIFUL CANADIAN ROCKIES.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.684
OUT.

02:30.718 --> 02:33.654
I HOPE WE CAN DO
THIS AGAIN SOMETIME.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.723
WELL, HERE YOU GO. LOOK.

02:35.756 --> 02:38.592
GOOD FOR ONE DINNER WITH
A HOT COUNCILWOMAN.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.630
JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR... IT'S ME.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.632
( theme music playing )

02:44.665 --> 02:47.301
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK ♪

02:47.335 --> 02:50.238
♪ WITH ME ♪

02:55.476 --> 02:58.679
RYDER, WHAT'S THE RULE ABOUT
TEXTING AT THE TABLE?

02:59.680 --> 03:02.650
DON'T GET CAUGHT?

03:02.683 --> 03:06.654
HE'S TEXTING HOLLY. SHE HAD TO GO TO
CINCINNATI FOR HER GREAT-AUNT'S FUNERAL.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.289
SHE'S GIVEN ME A
LIST OF TV SHOWS

03:08.322 --> 03:10.358
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO WATCH
UNTIL SHE GETS BACK.

03:11.792 --> 03:15.763
WHAT? SHE CAN TELL BY MY TONE OF VOICE
WHO GOT VOTED OFF "PROJECT RUNWAY."

03:18.399 --> 03:20.768
DUDE, THERE WERE JUST SO MANY
THINGS WRONG WITH THAT SENTENCE.

03:20.801 --> 03:23.771
HEY, SHE KNOWS WHAT
SHE LIKES, OKAY?

03:23.804 --> 03:27.275
AND SHE LIKES ME. SHE SAID
I'M "TOTALLY FIXABLE."

03:28.276 --> 03:31.379
- LIKE A DOG.
- SUCH A GOOD BOY THOUGH!

03:33.314 --> 03:35.349
HEY, IT'S SUPERGIRL!
LOOK AT THIS, C'MERE.

03:35.383 --> 03:37.985
FLY OVER HERE AND TASTE THIS. I WANT
YOU TO TELL ME IF IT NEEDS ANY OF YOUR

03:38.018 --> 03:40.421
MAGIC CANADIAN PAPRIKA.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.356
- LET IT GO, LONGO.
- I CAN LET YOUR LIE GO,

03:42.390 --> 03:44.258
BUT, YOU KNOW, I CAN'T
SPEAK FOR TRAVIS.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.794
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?
IT WASN'T A LIE LIE.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.762
IT WAS JUST A TINY
OMISSION OF TRUTH.

03:48.796 --> 03:51.699
HE ASSUMED I MADE THE MEAL,
AND FOR ME TO POINT OUT

03:51.732 --> 03:55.269
HIS ERROR WOULD
HAVE BEEN IMPOLITE.

03:55.303 --> 03:57.805
YEAH SURE, THERE'S NOTHING
RUDER THAN THE TRUTH.

03:57.838 --> 04:01.775
LOOK, JOE, IF A WOMAN SAW YOU
STANDING IN FRONT OF A PORSCHE

04:01.809 --> 04:04.044
AND SHE SAID "NICE CAR,"
YOU'D SAY "THANK YOU"

04:04.077 --> 04:05.779
- EVEN IF IT WASN'T YOUR CAR.
- WHAT?!

04:05.813 --> 04:07.815
- NO, I WOULDN'T.
- UH, YEAH, YOU WOULD.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.751
I SAW YOU DO IT AT
THE MALL LAST WEEK.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.456
RYDER'S BEEN TEXTING
AT THE TABLE.

04:20.461 --> 04:23.731
- HEY, MEL.
- TRAVIS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:23.764 --> 04:25.766
I COULDN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

04:25.799 --> 04:28.802
THOSE SQUASH BLOSSOMS WERE SO GOOD,
I WANTED TO GROW ANOTHER TONGUE.

04:28.836 --> 04:31.605
OOH, THAT'S A VERY
INTRIGUING IDEA.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.507
GO ON.

04:33.541 --> 04:38.045
I'M HERE TO REDEEM MY CERTIFICATE
FOR DINNER WITH A HOT COUNCILWOMAN.

04:38.078 --> 04:40.314
- HOW'S SATURDAY?
- THAT'S GREAT.

04:40.348 --> 04:43.083
UH, THERE'S THAT NEW CHINESE
PLACE JUST OPENED DOWNTOWN.

04:43.116 --> 04:46.086
WELL, I WAS THINKING HOW ABOUT
WE COOK A MEAL TOGETHER?

04:46.119 --> 04:47.855
- WE WHO?
- WE YOU.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.324
YOU'D COOK THE WHOLE THING,
I'LL DO ALL THE SHOPPING.

04:50.358 --> 04:51.859
I'LL EVEN CLEAN UP AFTERWARDS.

04:51.892 --> 04:54.728
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO TRY THE CHINESE PLACE?

04:54.762 --> 04:56.730
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A
KILLER KUNG PAO.

04:56.764 --> 05:00.468
I MEAN, YOU THINK YOU'RE BLOWN
AWAY BY THE KUNG, AND THEN POW!

05:00.501 --> 05:02.436
MEL, IT'S BEEN A BAD YEAR.

05:02.470 --> 05:05.539
SINCE I FOUND OUT ABOUT MY
GIRLFRIEND'S DELIGHTFUL SECRET LIFE...

05:05.573 --> 05:09.477
DON'T ASK... I'VE BEEN ALONE AND EATING
ALL MY MEALS OUT OF TAKEOUT BOXES.

05:09.510 --> 05:12.413
NOW IT SAYS HERE "GOOD FOR
A DINNER WITH MEL BURKE

05:12.446 --> 05:13.881
AT THE PLACE OF MY CHOICE."

05:13.914 --> 05:17.084
I CHOOSE YOUR PLACE
WITH YOUR HOME COOKING.

05:17.117 --> 05:20.554
WHAT DO YOU SAY? CANDLES, MUSIC,

05:20.588 --> 05:23.857
- WHITE WINE?
- ( sighs )

05:23.891 --> 05:27.795
LOOK, TRAVIS, I HAVE TO BE
COMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU.

05:27.828 --> 05:32.433
I DON'T... LIKE WHITE WINE.

05:37.938 --> 05:41.475
LONGO, LONGO, SHH!
I'M TRYING TO WORK.

05:41.509 --> 05:45.613
- YOU'RE WATCHING CARTOONS.
- IT'S "RATATOUILLE."

05:46.614 --> 05:48.849
IN WHAT UNIVERSE IS THAT WORK?

05:48.882 --> 05:51.719
OKAY, TRAVIS IS COMING OVER
SATURDAY NIGHT FOR DINNER

05:51.752 --> 05:55.789
WHICH HE ASKED ME TO MAKE...
IN FRONT OF HIM,

05:55.823 --> 05:57.858
SO I AM JUST TRYING
TO TEACH MYSELF

05:57.891 --> 06:00.394
HOW TO COOK A GOURMET MEAL
IN, YOU KNOW, 76 HOURS.

06:00.428 --> 06:02.930
BY WATCHING AN ANIMATED RAT?

06:02.963 --> 06:06.700
THAT'S LIKE LEARNING HOW TO
SWIM BY WATCHING "SPONGEBOB."

06:07.835 --> 06:10.571
PLEASE, JOE, JUST LET ME
GET BACK TO MY RESEARCH.

06:10.604 --> 06:11.905
JUST GO COOK DINNER

06:11.939 --> 06:14.842
WITH YOUR MASTERFUL
CULINARY SKILLS.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.144
OOOH, YOU LIKE THIS
GUY, DON'T YOU?

06:17.177 --> 06:20.448
I DO. I REALLY DO.

06:20.481 --> 06:23.584
- THEN YOU'RE SCREWED.
- PLEASE, JOE,

06:23.617 --> 06:26.887
PLEASE! WOULD YOU TEACH ME
HOW TO MAKE AN AMAZING MEAL?

06:26.920 --> 06:29.590
WOULD I TEACH YOU HOW TO
MAKE AN AMAZING MEAL...

06:29.623 --> 06:31.725
WHAT?

06:31.759 --> 06:34.695
WOULD YOU TEACH ME HOW TO
MAKE AN AMAZING MEAL...

06:34.728 --> 06:37.598
O LORD OF THE PANS?

06:37.631 --> 06:39.733
I LIKE THAT.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.975
OKAY, SO I'M GOING TO
GRAB US SOME SNACKS

06:48.008 --> 06:50.210
AND THEN WE CAN GO
STUDY UP IN MY ROOM.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.813
OR HERE. THIS AREA'S, YOU KNOW,

06:52.846 --> 06:54.448
FINE, REALLY.

06:54.482 --> 06:56.183
TRUST ME, NOELLE,

06:56.216 --> 06:58.986
MY ROOM WILL BE A
LOT LESS ANNOYING.

06:59.019 --> 07:02.189
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN THERE'S
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS ROOM.

07:02.222 --> 07:04.892
IT'S KINDA CUTE.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.496
WHAT'S UP?

07:08.529 --> 07:10.531
WHAT'S UP?

07:10.564 --> 07:13.000
IS THIS SEAT TAKEN?

07:13.033 --> 07:15.703
OH, I'M SORRY. I'LL
GET OUT OF YOUR WAY.

07:15.736 --> 07:16.970
NO!

07:17.004 --> 07:18.872
I MEAN, YOU CAN STAY.

07:18.906 --> 07:20.508
PLEASE STAY.

07:21.509 --> 07:25.879
WHATEVER. I DON'T CARE.

07:25.913 --> 07:28.616
SEE YOU LATER.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.618
WISH IT WAS LATER.

07:34.922 --> 07:36.957
REALLY? MY LITTLE BROTHER?

07:36.990 --> 07:39.893
HE STILL HAS A YODA PILLOWCASE.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.895
FRIGGIN' YODA!

07:44.998 --> 07:47.868
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. NOW WE'RE
GONNA GET STARTED, ALL RIGHT?

07:47.901 --> 07:50.604
SO REACH YOUR HAND INSIDE THE
BIRD AND PULL OUT THE GIBLETS.

07:50.638 --> 07:54.241
I HARDLY KNOW THIS CHICKEN. YOU REALLY
WANT ME TO GO TO THIRD BASE WITH HIM?

07:54.274 --> 07:56.944
- GET IN THERE AND GET THE GIBLETS.
- ( sighs )

07:56.977 --> 07:59.680
AND WHAT EXACTLY ARE GIBLETS?

07:59.713 --> 08:01.782
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? IT'S...
IT'S THE HEART,

08:01.815 --> 08:03.584
THE NECK, THE LIVER,
THE GIZZARDS.

08:03.617 --> 08:06.053
WHAT? GIZZARDS? NOW YOU'RE
JUST MAKING THIS CRAP UP.

08:06.086 --> 08:09.757
QUIT WHINING AND GET IN THERE AND
PULL OUT THE GIBLETS. LET'S GO!

08:09.790 --> 08:11.892
- ( groaning )
- COME ON.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.929
HOW WILL I KNOW WHEN I'VE FOUND...
OH.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.064
OKAY, I FOUND THEM.

08:17.097 --> 08:19.032
OH... UGH!

08:19.066 --> 08:21.501
IT'S A BOY.

08:23.103 --> 08:24.972
ALL RIGHT.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.307
- PUT YOUR HAND INSIDE THE CAVITY.
- ( gasps )

08:27.340 --> 08:30.978
PUT IT IN THERE, PUT A LITTLE PRESSURE ON
IT THEN START MASSAGING THE BREAST, OKAY?

08:31.011 --> 08:34.615
HERE WE GO, ALL RIGHTY. PUT A LITTLE
OF THIS... WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:34.648 --> 08:36.316

08:36.349 --> 08:39.887
WHAT'S THIS? CAN YOU MASSAGE IT?
RUB HARDER, OKAY?

08:39.920 --> 08:41.354
THERE WE GO.

08:41.388 --> 08:44.892
JEEZ, I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD LIGHT
SOME CANDLES AND POP IN AN ENYA CD.

08:44.925 --> 08:47.027
HOW'S THE PRESSURE?
IS IT TOO HARD?

08:47.060 --> 08:49.830
ARE YOU STAYING
HERE AT THE HOTEL?

08:49.863 --> 08:52.032
THAT'S A LITTLE CHICKEN HUMOR.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.302
I SHOULD PROBABLY TELL YOU, UM,

08:55.335 --> 08:57.838
YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP YOUR
HAND IN THERE ANYMORE.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.740
OH!

09:03.043 --> 09:05.613
WE CAN STUDY AT YOUR HOUSE
TOMORROW IF YOU WANT.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.615
YOU KNOW, JUST FOR A CHANGE.

09:07.648 --> 09:10.651
NO, THERE ARE THINGS HERE
YOU WON'T FIND AT MY HOUSE.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.820
NO NO NO NO NO NO.

09:12.853 --> 09:17.024
SEE, UM, LET ME EXPLAIN THIS TO
YOU IN A CALM, UNEMOTIONAL WAY.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.893
HE IS MY LITTLE
NOSE-PICKING BROTHER!

09:19.927 --> 09:23.130
IF PEOPLE SEE YOU GUYS TOGETHER
AT SCHOOL, THEY'LL MOCK ME.

09:23.163 --> 09:26.900
YOU... I'M ONLY THINKING OF YOU.

09:26.934 --> 09:29.136
I'M THINKING OF ME TOO.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.140
SO, WHATCHA DOING?

09:33.173 --> 09:35.776
I DON'T KNOW. I WAS SITTING.

09:35.809 --> 09:38.111
( giggles )

09:39.112 --> 09:41.749
YOU ARE SO FUNNY!

09:41.782 --> 09:44.084
SO WHO ARE YOU ALWAYS TEXTING?

09:44.117 --> 09:45.886
IS IT YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

09:45.919 --> 09:48.121
YES YES, HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND.

09:48.155 --> 09:50.691
A MEAN LITTLE GIRLFRIEND.

09:50.724 --> 09:53.994
YEAH, NORMALLY AT THIS TIME OF THE DAY,
SHE AND I SIT ON THE SWING TOGETHER.

09:54.027 --> 09:57.597
EVEN THOUGH SHE'S OUT OF TOWN, SHE STILL
WANTS ME TO STICK TO THE SCHEDULE.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.133
OH. WELL,

10:00.167 --> 10:03.136
IF YOUR SCHEDULE OPENS UP,

10:03.170 --> 10:05.005
HERE'S MY NUMBER.

10:06.774 --> 10:09.710
AND DON'T WASH YOUR ARM
UNTIL YOU CALL ME.

10:12.412 --> 10:14.381
UGH!

10:14.414 --> 10:15.849
WAIT, LENNOX!

10:15.883 --> 10:19.086
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

10:19.119 --> 10:21.655
THE LAST TIME SOMEONE
WROTE ON ME WAS AT CAMP.

10:21.689 --> 10:24.124
I WOKE UP WITH BOOBS
DRAWN ON MY FOREHEAD.

10:24.157 --> 10:28.829
THIS ISN'T A PRANK. NOELLE IS
SERIOUSLY CRUSHING ON YOU.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.931
WAIT, WHAT? WHY?

10:30.964 --> 10:33.667
SHE'S CUTE AND POPULAR AND
I'M THE KINDA GUY WHO...

10:33.701 --> 10:34.935
YOU KNOW.

10:34.968 --> 10:38.205
WALKS AROUND WITH BOOBS ON
HIS FOREHEAD FOR THREE DAYS?

10:38.238 --> 10:41.842
IT WAS PERMANENT MARKER! I RUBBED
THOSE BOOBS AS HARD AS I COULD!

10:43.143 --> 10:44.978
THEY WOULD NOT COME OFF!

10:45.012 --> 10:48.816
LOOK, YOU CANNOT BE
DATING ONE OF MY FRIENDS.

10:48.849 --> 10:52.820
IT'S IN THE BIBLE! "NERDS AND
NORMALS SHALL NOT HOOK UP."

10:53.954 --> 10:56.857
JUST STICK WITH HOLLY.
SHE'S SWEET AND LOVABLE.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.926
YOU CALLED HER A BALLBUSTER.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.261
OKAY, I'VE CALLED HER WORSE THAN THAT!
MOVE ON!

11:02.830 --> 11:05.665
LOOK, YOU'VE GOT TO TELL
NOELLE IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

11:06.199 --> 11:09.136
- UNLESS...
- DINNER, GUYS.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.537
HEY, UH, JOE, TELL ME SOMETHING.

11:10.570 --> 11:14.174
IS IT POSSIBLE I COULD, LIKE, GO OUT
WITH TWO GIRLS AT THE SAME TIME?

11:14.207 --> 11:17.677
DUDE, YOU GET UPSET WHEN YOUR
CARROTS TOUCH YOUR PEAS.

11:22.282 --> 11:25.719
DIG IN! CHICKEN STUFFED
WITH TAPENADE AND CHORIZO,

11:25.753 --> 11:28.255
PROSCIUTTO-WRAPPED ASPARAGUS
AND FINGERLING POTATOES.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.858
WOW, JOE. WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

11:30.891 --> 11:33.026
THE OCCASION IS YOUR
AUNT MADE DINNER.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.262
- NO THANKS.
- I'M NOT HUNGRY.

11:35.295 --> 11:37.731
NO NO, GUYS, IT'S OKAY.
I OVERSAW EVERYTHING.

11:37.765 --> 11:40.801
YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO BE THE GUINEA
PIGS FOR YOUR AUNT'S SOCIAL LIFE,

11:40.834 --> 11:42.870
SO DIG IN AND ENJOY.

11:42.903 --> 11:46.473
WOW. AUNT MEL, THIS IS
ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD.

11:46.506 --> 11:49.276
YEAH, IT'S BETTER THAN GOOD.
IT'S LIKE JOE GOOD.

11:49.309 --> 11:52.145
I DID IT! I CAN COOK.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.314
YEAH, SUCK IT, RACHEL RAY.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.251
OKAY, ALL THE UTENSILS
ARE LINED UP.

11:58.285 --> 12:01.154
YOU'VE GOT YOUR LITTLE CHEAT
SHEETS POSTED EVERYWHERE, RIGHT?

12:01.188 --> 12:04.157
YES, I DO! OH, THIS ONE SHOULD
BE CLOSER TO THE STOVE.

12:04.191 --> 12:06.259
HEY, BURKE, TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

12:06.293 --> 12:08.195
- IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.230
THANKS, LONGO. I REALLY
APPRECIATE YOU COMING THROUGH...

12:10.263 --> 12:11.965
- ( knocks )
- OH MY GOSH, GET OUT!

12:11.999 --> 12:13.233
YOU GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE. HE
CAN'T SEE YOU IN THE KITCHEN.

12:13.266 --> 12:16.003
THAT IS NOT TRAVIS YET, OKAY?

12:17.905 --> 12:19.306
- HEY THERE.
- HEY, JOE.

12:19.339 --> 12:22.009
- HOW ARE YOU?
- I'M CANDI.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.777
OH, OF COURSE YOU ARE.

12:23.811 --> 12:26.313
CANDI IS STUDYING
TO BE A MASSEUSE.

12:26.346 --> 12:29.549
I NEED 100 HOURS OF HANDS-ON
EXPERIENCE TO GET CERTIFIED.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.285
YEAH, SO I'M HELPING HER OUT, YOU KNOW?
LETTING HER...

12:32.319 --> 12:34.087
- PUT HER HANDS ALL OVER ME.
- AWWW.

12:34.121 --> 12:37.290
- SELFLESS TO A FAULT.
- THAT'S ME, THAT'S ME.

12:37.324 --> 12:41.294
I JUST FEEL THAT A MASSEUSE
IS A TERRIBLE THING TO WASTE.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.834
- TRAVIS!
- HEY, YOUR NEPHEW LET ME IN.

12:46.867 --> 12:49.036
HE CAN'T STOP SMILING
ABOUT SOMETHING.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.971
AND NEITHER CAN I.

12:52.372 --> 12:55.242
- SO ARE WE ALL READY TO GO?
- YEAH YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.977
UM, NEVER BEEN MORE READY.

12:57.010 --> 13:00.247
STEP ONE, WE WILL...

13:00.280 --> 13:02.950
RINSE THE CHICKEN.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.585
UH, ACTUALLY, MEL,
SLIGHT CHANGE IN PLANS.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.155
THERE'S NO CHICKEN.
SALMONELLA OUTBREAK.

13:08.188 --> 13:12.192
SALMONELLA? WAIT, THAT ONLY
KILLS LIKE ONE IN FIVE PEOPLE.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.261
I MEAN, ONE TWO... WE'RE GOOD.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.364
YOU'RE HILARIOUS, MEL.

13:17.397 --> 13:21.334
LOOK WHAT I GOT INSTEAD. FRESH
MAINE LOBSTER, FLOWN IN TODAY.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.370
BUT... BUT...

13:23.403 --> 13:25.973
AW, BUT CHICKEN! I KNOW CHICKEN.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.208
I WAS, UM, GONNA...

13:28.241 --> 13:31.979
RUB THE BREAST AND
STUFF THE CAVITY.

13:32.012 --> 13:34.047
WELL, WE'LL STUFF THE LOBSTERS.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.115
WITH CRABMEAT.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.584
IF THEY'RE FLYING ALL
THIS STUFF IN FROM MAINE,

13:37.617 --> 13:40.187
WHY CAN'T THEY FLY IN
A FEW DAMN CHICKENS?

13:40.220 --> 13:41.621
OH MY GOODNESS.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.991
- HOW'S THAT PRESSURE?
- IT'S AMAZING.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.059
YOU SHOULD REALLY BE A Ph.D.
IN THIS.

13:46.093 --> 13:47.995
REALLY? YOU'D CERTIFY ME?

13:48.028 --> 13:50.931
I WOULD CERTIFY YOU RIGHT NOW.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.601
JOE, JOE, MAYDAY MAYDAY!

13:54.634 --> 13:57.270
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU
CAN'T JUST BURST IN HERE.

13:57.304 --> 14:00.340
CANDI'S RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF
STUDYING FOR HER DEEP-TISSUE MIDTERM.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.009
NO CHICKENS,
SALMONELLA OUTBREAK,

14:02.042 --> 14:04.411
SCARY LOBSTERS, HELP.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.947
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? CAN
YOU AT LEAST GET OUTSIDE,

14:06.980 --> 14:08.415
PLEASE, UNTIL SHE TURNS ME OVER?

14:08.448 --> 14:12.019
NO, YOU'VE GOTTA HELP ME!
I NEED A NEW PLAN.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.021
OH JEEZ, ALL RIGHT.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.023
I GOT A PLAN FOR YOU.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.290
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE:

14:17.324 --> 14:20.093
FIND A RAT THAT'S A
REALLY GOOD COOK,

14:20.127 --> 14:21.361
HIDE HIM UNDERNEATH
YOUR CHEF'S HAT

14:21.394 --> 14:23.897
AND OVERNIGHT YOU'LL
BE THE TOAST OF PARIS.

14:23.931 --> 14:27.334
JOE, BE SERIOUS. I MEAN
IF I COULD HIDE A...

14:27.367 --> 14:29.169
WAIT A MINUTE.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.438
THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

14:31.471 --> 14:34.141
COME ON, RAT. LET'S
GET YOU UNDER MY HAT.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.081
ALL RIGHT, CAN YOU SEE ME?

14:41.114 --> 14:43.316
Unfortunately yes.

14:43.350 --> 14:46.353
All right, so you're gonna want to
bring the water to a roiling boil.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.422
MEL, I ALMOST FORGOT
THESE IN THE CAR.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.258
- I BROUGHT THEM FOR YOU.
- AW, I LOVE THEM!

14:51.291 --> 14:53.226
PUT 'EM OUTSIDE.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.228
...HANDSOME.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.433
- OKAY, I'M BACK.
- Okay now,

15:00.467 --> 15:02.702
once the water is boiling,
you're gonna take the lobsters

15:02.735 --> 15:05.272
- and you're gonna put them in the pot.
- BUT THAT'LL KILL THEM!

15:06.439 --> 15:08.141
Grow a pair, Burke.

15:10.377 --> 15:12.679
HEY, AUNT MEL, I REALLY
GOTTA TALK TO YOU.

15:12.712 --> 15:15.082
- YEAH, IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME.
- YOU KNOW WHAT'S A WORSE TIME?

15:15.115 --> 15:17.250
HAVING YOUR REPUTATION RUINED
BECAUSE YOUR LITTLE BROTHER

15:17.284 --> 15:19.052
IS ABOUT TO START DATING
ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS.

15:19.086 --> 15:22.022
NOELLE? HOT NOELLE?
SHE'LL EAT HIM ALIVE.

15:22.055 --> 15:24.124
SHE WOULD. OH, THANK YOU!

15:24.157 --> 15:27.995
ANYTIME! OKAY, JOE,

15:28.028 --> 15:29.963
I MEAN, LOOK, I'VE BEEN
CHECKING ALL OVER.

15:29.997 --> 15:32.299
DO THESE GUYS HAVE GIBLETS?
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE ANY WAY IN.

15:32.332 --> 15:36.136
- ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?
- NO... UH, LOBSTER.

15:36.169 --> 15:39.239
I LIKE TO EXPLAIN THE PROCEDURE,
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE

15:39.272 --> 15:42.009
THEY'RE MORE RELAXED,
THEY TASTE BETTER.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.377
ALL RIGHT. READY FOR
MY NEXT ASSIGNMENT.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.179
OKAY, UM, YEAH,

15:46.213 --> 15:48.181
CANDLES, YES! CANDLES.

15:48.215 --> 15:51.051
WHOA, TOO FAST! I MEAN
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

15:51.084 --> 15:55.455
UM, HERE, THESE ARE BETTER. LIGHT
THESE AND PUT 'EM AROUND THE PATIO.

15:55.488 --> 15:58.058
- HOW MANY DO YOU WANT?
- ALL OF THEM.

15:58.091 --> 16:01.561
THE MORE CANDLES, THE BETTER THE MOOD.
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.999
OKAY. ( groans )

16:06.033 --> 16:08.268
- ALL RIGHT, WHERE WERE WE?
- AUNT MEL, HAVE YOU SEEN MY...

16:08.301 --> 16:10.370
- OH, THERE IT IS.
- NO, GET YOUR HANDS OFF THAT THING!

16:10.403 --> 16:12.272
- IT'S MINE.
- NO, BUT I PAID FOR IT!

16:12.305 --> 16:15.208
HOLLY HEARD THAT NOELLE LIKES ME AND
SHE WANTS TO CHAT, LIKE, RIGHT NOW.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.744
Computer: Please accept
video chat from Holly.

16:17.777 --> 16:20.413
HEY, RYDER, I WAS
JUST UP WITH LENNOX

16:20.447 --> 16:22.549
- AND I WAS WONDERING...
- NOELLE, OH MY GOD.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.084
Please accept video
chat from Holly.

16:24.117 --> 16:27.287
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE STUDYING WITH
LENNOX, CAN YOU JUST GO BACK UP THERE?

16:27.320 --> 16:29.022
I'D RATHER BE WITH YOU.

16:29.056 --> 16:31.291
- Video chat accepted.
- OOPS.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.226
HI HOLLY. IT'S HOLLY.

16:36.529 --> 16:39.132
THAT'S GONNA VOID THE WARRANTY!

16:39.166 --> 16:41.134
IT'S GONNA VOID MY LIFE.

16:41.168 --> 16:45.072
AW, RYDER, WHAT A TERRIBLE
TRAGEDY YOUR GIRLFRIEND SAW US.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.811
WHAT THE HECK'S
GOING ON DOWN HERE?

16:51.844 --> 16:54.581
I HEARD A STRUGGLE AND A
SPLASH AND THEN I LOST YOU.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.516
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE, JOE.
I GIVE UP.

16:56.549 --> 16:59.186
AFTER WE'VE COME THIS FAR?
NO WAY, UH-UH.

16:59.219 --> 17:02.055
MOVE OUT OF THE WAY.
GIVE THE RAT THE TONGS.

17:02.089 --> 17:04.457
HERE WE GO...

17:09.529 --> 17:12.265
YOU REALLY CAN'T
FOLLOW A RECIPE.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.804
THAT'S IT. I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO COME
CLEAN AND TELL TRAVIS THAT I'M A FRAUD.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.839
HE'LL PROBABLY NEVER
SPEAK TO ME AGAIN.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.609
WHY, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T COOK? I
MEAN, COME ON. ANY REASONABLE GUY

17:22.642 --> 17:25.478
WOULD BE FLATTERED THAT A WOMAN LIKE
YOU WENT TO ALL THIS TROUBLE FOR HIM.

17:25.512 --> 17:28.115
NOW TAKE THAT LOBSTER AND
GIVE HIM A NICE HOT BATH.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.616
- YOU CAN DO IT.
- I CAN'T!

17:29.649 --> 17:31.818
LOOK AT THOSE CUTE
LITTLE EYES UP THERE.

17:31.851 --> 17:34.387
I'LL HELP YOU. HEY, BUDDY,

17:34.421 --> 17:36.356
IT'S TIME FOR A NICE HOT BATH.
ARE YOU READY?

17:36.389 --> 17:38.225
AND IN THE WATER.

17:38.258 --> 17:39.826
THERE WE GO. LOOK AT
THAT, YOU DID IT.

17:39.859 --> 17:41.494
I DID IT! THIS IS GREAT.

17:41.528 --> 17:44.231
I MEAN NOT FOR YOU. SORRY.

17:46.466 --> 17:49.336
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING OUT HERE?

17:49.369 --> 17:51.871
YOU KNOW, I WAS IN THERE WITH NOELLE
AND SHE WAS MASSAGING MY NECK

17:51.904 --> 17:53.373
AND IT FELT SO GOOD AND...

17:53.406 --> 17:55.275
THEN I JUST HAD TO
GET OUT OF THERE.

17:55.308 --> 17:58.178
- HOW DID YOU ESCAPE?
- I TOLD HER I NEEDED A SMOKE.

18:00.247 --> 18:03.483
- GOOD COVER!
- I MADE A COMPLETE MESS OF IT.

18:03.516 --> 18:06.386
HOLLY SAW ME WITH NOELLE
AND NOW I'M DEAD.

18:06.419 --> 18:09.589
WHY DO YOU CARE? I MEAN IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU'VE ALREADY MADE YOUR DECISION.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.392
I HAVE?

18:12.425 --> 18:15.395
YEAH! YOU'RE NOELLE'S BOY NOW.

18:15.428 --> 18:18.665
- CONGRATULATIONS!
- I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T WANT ME DATING YOUR FRIEND.

18:18.698 --> 18:21.301
OH, I WAS JUST BEING SELFISH.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.636
YOU AND NOELLE CLEARLY
HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.239
YEAH.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.908
AND THAT IS...?

18:28.941 --> 18:31.411
I CAN'T DEFINE IT,
BUT IT'S THERE.

18:31.444 --> 18:34.347
AND WITH NOELLE BEING A
MORE EXPERIENCED WOMAN

18:34.381 --> 18:38.351
WHO'S BEEN WITH TONS OF BOYS...
UPPERCLASSMEN,

18:38.385 --> 18:40.553
EVEN A COUPLE OF COLLEGE
GUYS, I HEAR...

18:40.587 --> 18:43.156
SHE'LL BE EXPECTING A LOT.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.292
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN
HANDLE THAT, RIGHT?

18:45.325 --> 18:48.295
( strained ) MM-HMM.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.297
YEAH, THE SAFE OLD
DAYS WITH HOLLY...

18:50.330 --> 18:52.432
OVER. THAT WAS THE SANDBOX.

18:52.465 --> 18:56.303
WELCOME TO THE THUNDERDOME.

18:57.704 --> 19:00.273
I WANT HOLLY. I WANT HER BACK.

19:00.307 --> 19:03.410
- ARE YOU SURE?
- MORE THAN ANYTHING.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.412
WELL OKAY, IT'S YOUR DECISION.

19:05.445 --> 19:09.282
IT IS. AND I'VE JUST GOTTA GO IN
THERE AND TELL NOELLE IT'S OVER.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.619
WOULD YOU DO THAT FOR ME?

19:13.620 --> 19:15.422
YEAH YEAH, I'LL DO THAT.

19:15.455 --> 19:18.425
JUST GO TAKE A WALK AND
FINISH YOUR FAKE SMOKE.

19:18.458 --> 19:21.328
THANKS.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.396
YOU'RE A GREAT SISTER.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.401
( sighs ) I SHOULD
TEACH A CLASS.

19:30.770 --> 19:33.540
ALL RIGHT, SO PUT AN EQUAL AMOUNT
OF STUFFING ON EACH PLATE,

19:33.573 --> 19:35.575
ADD THE SIDES, YOU ARE
GOOD TO GO, 'KAY?

19:35.608 --> 19:37.710
OH, THANKS, LONGO. HEY...

19:37.744 --> 19:40.747
- WE REALLY DID IT, DIDN'T WE?
- YEAH, I GUESS WE DID.

19:40.780 --> 19:44.517
- WE MAKE A PRETTY GOOD TEAM.
- YEAH, BURKE AND LONGO, ONE HELL OF A TEAM.

19:44.551 --> 19:47.620
- ( chuckles )
- NOW GET UPSTAIRS BEFORE TRAVIS FINDS OUT ABOUT US.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.489
TOO LATE!

19:49.522 --> 19:52.525
I CAN'T BELIEVE I KEEP WALKING
IN ON STUFF LIKE THIS!

19:52.559 --> 19:54.661
WELL, AT LEAST YOU TWO
HAVE YOUR CLOTHES ON.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.264
OF COURSE WE HAVE CLOTHES ON.
WE WERE COOKING.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.632
I MEAN I WAS COOKING! LOOK
LOOK, OKAY, JOE WAS COOKING.

19:59.666 --> 20:03.270
EVERYTHING YOU ATE THE OTHER
NIGHT WAS STUFF THAT JOE MADE.

20:04.771 --> 20:07.407
IT'S TRUE. YEAH, I MEAN,

20:07.440 --> 20:09.542
SHE CAN'T COOK. SHE'S
AN AWFUL COOK.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.712
BUT SHE'S GOT A LOT OF
OTHER GREAT QUALITIES.

20:14.681 --> 20:17.517
NONE OF WHICH ARE COMING TO
MY MIND RIGHT NOW, BUT...

20:17.550 --> 20:19.419
I KNOW THEY'RE IN
THERE SOMEWHERE.

20:19.452 --> 20:22.389
- WELL, COME ON, YOU GUYS HAVE A THING.
- NO THING... NOTHING.

20:22.422 --> 20:25.525
- WHY DO PEOPLE THINK THAT?
- WE ARE A MAN AND A WOMAN WHO LIVE TOGETHER

20:25.558 --> 20:28.528
AND WE'RE RAISING A COUPLE OF KIDS.
HOW IS THAT A RELATIONSHIP?

20:28.561 --> 20:30.697
I MEAN HE DOESN'T EVEN
REALLY LIVE IN THE HOUSE.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.500
HE LIVES WAY WAY WAY OUT
THERE, OVER THE GARAGE.

20:33.533 --> 20:36.269
IN FACT, HE HAS ANOTHER WOMAN
IN HIS ROOM RIGHT NOW.

20:36.303 --> 20:37.570
I DO.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.706
I ALWAYS DO.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.708
I'M NOT GETTING INTO
THE MIDDLE OF THIS.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.277
IT'S NOT GOING TO
HAPPEN TO ME AGAIN.

20:44.311 --> 20:46.713
ONE OF THESE DAYS I'M GOING TO
WALK IN ON SOMETHING NORMAL.

20:48.581 --> 20:52.285
WOW, THAT GUY... THAT
GUY HAS SOME ISSUES.

20:52.319 --> 20:55.555
YEP. I MEAN, WE'RE JUST TWO
FRIENDS DOING WHAT FRIENDS DO.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.825
EXACTLY... FRIENDS. I MEAN, BEING
THERE FOR EACH OTHER NO MATTER WHAT.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.828
Candi: JOE, ARE YOU COMING BACK?

21:01.861 --> 21:03.596
SEE YA.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.703
YOU KNOW, JOE, DINNER WITH
YOU IS A LOT LESS PRESSURE.

21:10.737 --> 21:13.540
I MEAN, I CAN GET FOOD IN MY TEETH,
SPILL BUTTER ALL OVER MY DRESS

21:13.573 --> 21:16.443
AND IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.
THERE ARE DEFINITE ADVANTAGES

21:16.476 --> 21:18.611
TO LIVING WITH SOMEONE YOU
DON'T CARE THAT MUCH ABOUT.

21:18.645 --> 21:20.580
WE ARE PRETTY LUCKY.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.583
OH MY GOSH, THAT IS
JUST INCREDIBLE.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.585
IT IS BEYOND HUMAN EXPERIENCE.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.555
OH, WILL YOU STOP? COME ON, IT'S
JUST A COUPLE OF BOILED LOBSTERS.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.690
NOT THAT. CANDI.

21:33.426 --> 21:36.763
IS THE PRESSURE GOOD? ARE YOU
STAYING HERE AT THE HOTEL?

21:37.764 --> 21:39.699
I TAUGHT HER THAT.
