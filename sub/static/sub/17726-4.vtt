00:03.537 --> 00:04.838

of you guys tonight.

00:04.872 --> 00:07.108
I would love it if you guys
would be my groomsmen.

00:07.141 --> 00:08.509
- What is that, dude?
- What is that thing

00:08.542 --> 00:09.810
in the butt cheek
in the middle?

00:09.843 --> 00:12.980
- It's your steak, motherf---er.
- What the f---?

00:13.013 --> 00:14.282
- Also sitting here
with someone pretending

00:14.315 --> 00:16.417
that they haven't had
a married boyfriend.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.452
- I don't have
a married boyfriend.

00:18.486 --> 00:20.421
- You got the Range Rover
and all that in eight years?

00:20.454 --> 00:22.490
- Of course I can afford
a Range Rover.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.658
How are you
since we had headlock?

00:24.692 --> 00:25.993
- My head's doing okay.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.728
It's still on.
- Are you fired yet?

00:27.761 --> 00:29.130
- I haven't spoken to Lisa
about that.

00:29.163 --> 00:30.698
I have to talk to her tonight
If she comes in.

00:30.731 --> 00:33.967
- If I catch you drinking,
doing whatever you're doing,

00:34.001 --> 00:35.936
if you do any of that...

00:35.969 --> 00:37.505
[clicks tongue]
We're done.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.640
- I saw you talking to Lala.
- And it was, like,

00:39.673 --> 00:41.075
completely taken out of context.

00:41.109 --> 00:42.443
- It was very unexpected,
so I'm--

00:42.476 --> 00:44.245
- And I'm not going
to talk to her.

00:44.278 --> 00:45.479
- It just--
it just looks like my friends

00:45.513 --> 00:47.215
are questioning my decisions.

have hooks for purses?

01:19.513 --> 01:21.449
- Under the table?
- Yeah.

01:21.482 --> 01:24.452
- You better invent that
and sell it to everybody.

01:24.485 --> 01:25.886
- It exists.
They just don't have it here.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.222
- Make millions of dollars.
- Oh.

01:28.256 --> 01:29.957
- My little baby brother,
Jeremy,

01:29.990 --> 01:31.492
has moved in with Tom and I.

01:31.525 --> 01:33.894
- Dude, whatever you want
to wear today of mine.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.963
I know you don't have a lot of
your clothes here yet, so just--

01:35.996 --> 01:37.465
- Damn, hell, yeah.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.400
- Before Jeremy started
staying with us,

01:39.433 --> 01:41.335
I would say Tom and I
were having sex

01:41.369 --> 01:44.505
probably three times a week.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.940
Now it's more like

01:46.974 --> 01:49.610
maybe once every other week,

01:49.643 --> 01:50.844
so...

01:50.878 --> 01:53.247
I mean,
I guess that's different.

f---ing sick.

02:01.855 --> 02:03.691
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

02:03.724 --> 02:04.892
- How is everybody?

02:04.925 --> 02:06.227
- Great.
- How are you?

02:06.260 --> 02:08.962
- You know, I'm feeling so fresh
and so clean today.

02:08.996 --> 02:12.200
- I say the same sh-- to myself
in the mirror every morning.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.535
- Yeah?
- Anyone?

02:14.568 --> 02:16.637
- I'm not driving
a Volkswagen Passat.

02:16.670 --> 02:17.838
Maybe I should be.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.507
Maybe no one
would question me then.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.409
- You need anoth--
you need, like, another car.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.244
- You need a burner car.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.879
- People at Sur
ask me about my car

02:25.913 --> 02:27.348
and how that was paid for,

02:27.381 --> 02:31.219
but I don't owe any of
these people any explanation.

02:31.252 --> 02:35.022
I'm sucking dick for a lot
more than Range Rovers, honey.

02:35.055 --> 02:36.224
[chuckles]

02:36.224 --> 02:37.258
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.859
- How are you doing today?
all: Good.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.093
- How are you?
- I'm gonna be comatose

02:40.127 --> 02:41.795
after this.
- Comatose?

02:41.829 --> 02:43.231
- Can I start with
your buffalo chicken cheese fr--

02:43.264 --> 02:44.598
- You want to start with the
buffalo chicken cheese fries?

02:44.632 --> 02:46.667
- Yeah, girl, that sounds good.
- Of course, no problem.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.602
- I think I'm gonna
do some pepperoni fries.

02:48.636 --> 02:52.005
- All right, I'll be back.
- What'd you guys do last night?

02:52.039 --> 02:55.943
- I went to James's,
and we just, like, had "Champs,"

02:55.976 --> 02:58.346
and I got his apartment
not so mannish

02:58.379 --> 02:59.647
because his girlfriend,

02:59.680 --> 03:01.249
Raquel, comes in today.
- Does he--

03:01.249 --> 03:03.317
- Have you met her before?
She's 21,

03:03.351 --> 03:04.718
and--but she's a pageant girl,

03:04.752 --> 03:06.754
so I know that she wants
to, like,

03:06.787 --> 03:08.889
be a goody two-shoes.

03:08.922 --> 03:12.393
- So Raquel's gonna stay
in the living room...

03:12.426 --> 03:13.527
- With--
- In the sheet wall?

03:13.561 --> 03:16.464
- So you would understand
my concern.

03:16.497 --> 03:17.798
- Oh, my God.
- Like, I'm not gonna

03:17.831 --> 03:19.533
bump pee-pees with my man
behind a screen, you know?

03:19.567 --> 03:20.834
- [laughs]
Stop it.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.471
- This is my sleeping area,

03:23.504 --> 03:25.573
my bed, my Union Jack.

03:25.606 --> 03:26.907
- Go in the--go in the bathroom

03:26.940 --> 03:28.909
and turn on the sink.
- [laughs]

03:28.942 --> 03:31.645
- But it's too small.
There's no way.

03:31.679 --> 03:32.846
- If you can do it
in the airplane,

03:32.880 --> 03:34.815
you can do it in that bathroom.

03:34.848 --> 03:37.084
- Who--who does it
in an airplane?

03:37.117 --> 03:39.186
- I've done it before.
- What?

03:39.287 --> 03:40.921
- Like, a regular
commercial plane?

03:40.954 --> 03:43.324
- Yeah.
- [giggling]

03:43.357 --> 03:44.425
- Standing doggie.
- Gangster, gangster.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.093
- Gangster.
- Right?

03:46.126 --> 03:48.762
- You think Raquel will
keep him in line?

03:48.796 --> 03:50.097
- I mean, I hope so.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.300
- I mean, I know Lisa
would probably love to give him,

03:52.300 --> 03:54.935
like, literally
a million chances, but--

03:54.968 --> 03:57.705
- She can only do so much before
it starts to look bad on her.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.039
- I'm sure it's--before she's--
- Right.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.309
- I mean, Lisa has a reputation
she has to maintain,

04:01.309 --> 04:04.111
and James is testing

04:04.144 --> 04:05.446
that boundary.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.348
- I think he has
one chance left.

04:07.381 --> 04:10.318
- And he needs
to be really careful.

I've met this girl that
I'm completely in love with.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.349
Her name's Raquel,
and I met her

04:41.382 --> 04:44.184
at Pump on New Year's Eve
while I was DJing.

04:44.217 --> 04:45.353
I played a little BeyoncÃ©,

and I wound up
with a girlfriend.

04:49.923 --> 04:52.225
I gave you the princess glass...
- Aww.

04:52.259 --> 04:53.961
- 'Cause my other one broke.
- Oh, thank you.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.163
- I'm so excited you're home
for the summer.

04:56.196 --> 04:58.999
We've been seeing each other
long distance.

04:59.032 --> 05:02.370
She's doing her senior year in
school right now up in Sonoma,

05:02.403 --> 05:04.372
but she's here for the summer
staying with her parents.

05:04.372 --> 05:06.907
It's gonna be a good one.
So when is your next pageant?

05:06.940 --> 05:09.810
- The end of June.
- I'm gonna be there.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.579
Raquel's a beauty pageant girl,

05:11.612 --> 05:13.781
and she works with special
needs kids as well,

05:13.814 --> 05:14.948
as opposed to Kristen,

05:14.982 --> 05:16.617
who basically is
a special needs kid.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.520
- But how are you doing?
- So work's been good for me,

05:19.553 --> 05:21.154
you know, apart
from that one slip-up.

05:21.188 --> 05:23.190
- Yeah, what happened?
- This guy came in and,

05:23.223 --> 05:25.459
you know, kind of slowed
the night down

05:25.493 --> 05:28.061
by putting me in a headlock.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.262
[chuckles]

05:29.296 --> 05:30.831
I didn't retaliate or anything.

05:30.864 --> 05:33.133
- There are
a lot of people that

05:33.166 --> 05:34.868
apparently don't like you.

05:34.902 --> 05:36.404
- [laughs]
- I don't know why.

05:36.404 --> 05:39.407

- [spits]
- F--- you.

05:40.674 --> 05:41.809
You did not
just spit on my door.

- Yeah, bitch.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.712
- Walk away.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.046
Like, I don't wanna do this.

- I just feel like
people are jealous.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.616
Like, I say that once,
I say it again.

05:48.649 --> 05:51.652
Like, people see me in, like,
some kind of a limelight.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.321
You know, I'm not serving
fried chicken,

05:54.422 --> 05:55.623
and they don't--they hate that.

05:55.656 --> 05:58.225
- Well, yeah, but you're
pursuing your dream...

05:58.258 --> 06:00.561
- Yeah.
- And if that's upsetting people

06:00.594 --> 06:02.896

06:23.451 --> 06:25.318
- Well, I'm already coming over.
- Yeah.

06:25.352 --> 06:27.020
- To take care
of your sobbing ass.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.122
- And then I'll come over
and make fun of you.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.991
- I'm getting veneers put in
tomorrow

06:31.024 --> 06:33.994
because I'd like to assume
that guys still look at me.

06:34.027 --> 06:36.263
It's like, I'm so vain
that I would like to think

06:36.296 --> 06:37.531
that I still have it.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.500
I'll be a source
of comic relief.

06:39.533 --> 06:40.934
- That sounds good, yeah.
I'm gonna come over.

06:40.968 --> 06:43.103
- I'm gonna be like, "Hmm."
- I'm gonna haze you.

06:43.136 --> 06:46.073
- So Carter and I went over
to Scheana's parents yesterday.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.307
We were hanging out
with her and Shay.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.777
She started getting upset,
and she was like,

06:49.810 --> 06:51.945
"The other night Katie was drunk
and she hurt me," and I go

06:51.979 --> 06:53.246
but I think you've hurt
her feelings too.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.882
- What have I done to her?
- I don't know.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.850
She said she--
you hurt her feelings when--

06:56.884 --> 06:58.752
at your house or something.
- When I try to have

06:58.786 --> 07:00.721
a critical conversation
with Scheana...

07:00.754 --> 07:02.322
I'm just asking for,
like, support.

07:02.355 --> 07:03.991
I don't need to be,
like, corrected.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.159
- You keep saying that I said
something I didn't say.

07:06.193 --> 07:09.530
- I am not.
She becomes so defensive.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.599
That's, like, not fair.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.166
But don't come to me
and say...

07:13.200 --> 07:14.802
- Right.
- "F--- her,"

07:14.835 --> 07:16.804
and then to Lala you're
gonna be, like, cool with.

07:16.837 --> 07:19.072
- That's an issue.
- Oh, that's a huge issue.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.141
- It's a loyalty thing.
- Yeah.

07:21.174 --> 07:22.309
- Are we busy?

07:22.342 --> 07:23.911
- Yeah, there's a party
in the garden.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.913
- Okay.
- Okie doke.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.114
Sounds good.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.882

07:28.916 --> 07:31.118
Roll up city.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.521
Here you go.

07:33.521 --> 07:36.156
- Thanks.
- Are you and Katie okay now?

07:36.189 --> 07:37.991
- I mean, you know,

07:38.025 --> 07:40.661
when Katie's drunk,
she's irrational.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.730
She accused me, like, four times

07:42.763 --> 07:45.999
of saying something
I absolutely did not say.

07:46.033 --> 07:49.369

07:53.741 --> 07:54.975
*

07:55.008 --> 07:58.178
- Is there a big party
happening in here tonight?

07:58.211 --> 07:59.212
- Yeah, in the garden.

07:59.246 --> 08:00.581
- Are you--okay,
are you working that?

08:00.614 --> 08:01.815
- It's probably
one of the closers.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.551
- Okay, are you gonna be
working in there?

08:03.551 --> 08:05.919
- I'm on restaurant side.
- Okay.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.621
Are you liking it?
- Yeah.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.456
- Yeah?
- So far it's been fun.

08:09.557 --> 08:12.092
- But you've been--you've been
a waitress before, right?

08:12.125 --> 08:14.394
Haven't you?
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.664
- So how was
everybody's weekend?

08:16.697 --> 08:19.700
Did you guys have to work,
or did you get to have fun?

08:22.069 --> 08:24.104
- I'm, like, really not trying
to be a bitch.

08:24.137 --> 08:26.907
It's just, like,
Katie is one of my best friends.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.976
I'm happy to say hello to you
and be professional.

08:29.009 --> 08:32.045
I just, like--the conversation,
it just makes me uncomfortable,

08:32.079 --> 08:35.382
but I hope you had
a fun weekend.

08:35.415 --> 08:38.151
*

08:38.185 --> 08:40.721
The last time Katie saw
Lala and I in the same room

08:40.754 --> 08:43.857
I got the full-on wrath
of tequila Katie,

08:43.891 --> 08:46.426
so I don't want anyone to see
Lala trying to talk to me

08:46.459 --> 08:47.861
'cause then that's gonna
get back to Katie,

08:47.895 --> 08:49.797
and I don't want to hear it.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.665
- I got a marble trash can...
[cell phone beeps]

08:51.699 --> 08:54.134
And now it's too heavy
for me to empty the trash.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.169
- Well, then start working out.
[all chuckle]

08:56.203 --> 08:57.337
I don't know what to tell you.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.307
- [laughs]
- What's up?

09:00.340 --> 09:02.409
- Scheana just texted me
from work.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.612
"I'm at work opening with Brit,
and Lala is here.

09:04.612 --> 09:07.047
"She came up all nice
and tried to talk to us

09:07.080 --> 09:08.481
"when I interrupted her
and said,

09:08.515 --> 09:10.217
"'Not trying to be a bitch,
but we aren't friends.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.785
"'Katie is my friend.
You talking to me

09:11.819 --> 09:13.621
makes me really uncomfortable.'"

09:13.654 --> 09:16.189
*

09:16.223 --> 09:17.825
- Obviously,
I'm very proud of Scheana

09:17.858 --> 09:19.960
for finally telling Lala off,

09:19.993 --> 09:21.294
but she should have done that

09:21.328 --> 09:23.363
from the beginning.
You know what I mean?

09:23.396 --> 09:26.266
So cool, Scheana, welcome back
to our group of friends.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.434
Don't f--- it up.

09:27.467 --> 09:29.703
- It's a step
in the positive direction

09:29.737 --> 09:30.971
that she did this today.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.040
- I agree it's--
and I'm so proud of her,

09:33.073 --> 09:35.242
but this is gonna be something
that keeps coming up,

09:35.275 --> 09:36.710
just, like, the way she acts.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.712
- Well, I think we can just
all get together

09:38.746 --> 09:40.147
and just have, like,
a conversation...

09:40.180 --> 09:41.448
- Yeah.
- And at the end of it

09:41.481 --> 09:42.650
we're all on the same page
about everything.

09:42.683 --> 09:43.884
- Yeah.
- The quicker we can all...

09:43.917 --> 09:45.485
- Get this over with?
- Move on from this,

09:45.518 --> 09:46.954
that would be better.
- Yeah.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.689
[dramatic music]

09:48.722 --> 09:49.957
[indistinct chatter]

09:49.990 --> 09:51.224
- Here's a cocktail menu.

09:51.258 --> 09:55.796
*

09:55.829 --> 09:58.065
- Hey, darling.
- How are you?

09:58.098 --> 10:01.034
- Good. How are you?
- Good.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.870
- How well do you know
the wine list?

10:02.903 --> 10:04.938
- I know it okay.
I'm still studying it.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.439
- Well, hurry up.
- I am.

10:06.473 --> 10:07.875
Just getting caught up
on everything.

10:07.908 --> 10:08.976
- Hi.
- Hey.

10:09.009 --> 10:11.044
- How are you?
- Good.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.545
How are you?

10:12.579 --> 10:15.015
- How long are we gonna
tolerate this?

10:15.048 --> 10:16.850
- What?
- James Kennedy.

10:16.884 --> 10:18.986
- Oh, okay, don't tell me.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.755
He's been okay, right?

10:21.789 --> 10:23.023
- Really?
- Why?

10:23.056 --> 10:24.291
What's he doing now?

10:24.324 --> 10:27.527
- Coming in here drunk.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.797
Like, him, like,
screaming and yelling,

10:29.830 --> 10:30.998
disconnecting the music,

10:31.031 --> 10:32.766
leaving the entire venue
without music.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.368
- I mean, that's no good.
How can I have that?

10:35.402 --> 10:38.205
I have made it
exceedingly clear to James

10:38.238 --> 10:41.141
that if he's ever
intoxicated at work,

10:41.174 --> 10:44.411
that will be the end
of his tenure,

10:44.444 --> 10:46.714
so if I can actually get

10:46.747 --> 10:48.816
definitive evidence

10:48.849 --> 10:51.685
that James has been
drinking on the job,

10:51.719 --> 10:54.421
then that's
the only excuse I need.

10:54.454 --> 10:57.057
- Like, I don't want him to be,
like, acting like this

10:57.090 --> 10:59.492
and feels like he's so entitled.

10:59.526 --> 11:02.129
- And do you think he's kind
of acted entitled lately?

11:02.162 --> 11:03.463
- Yeah, like, I--

11:03.496 --> 11:06.734
I seriously
do not like this person.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.101
- All right.

11:08.135 --> 11:09.402
- I know you will
take care of it.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.538
- Thanks, Diana.
- Of course.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.975
- How many times have we had
those falling outs

11:15.008 --> 11:16.744
you've told me you're not happy,
you don't want to be with me?

11:16.777 --> 11:18.045
Like, I just--sometimes
I wonder if there's,

11:18.078 --> 11:19.412
like, a nugget of truth to that.

11:25.052 --> 11:27.554
- * Set me free

11:31.424 --> 11:33.961
- Hey, is this
Dr. Engler's office?

11:33.994 --> 11:36.629
- Yes, it is.
- Hey, this is Tom Schwartz.

11:36.663 --> 11:38.766
I was just calling
to let Dr. Engler know

11:38.766 --> 11:40.467
that I'm gonna be,
like, ten minutes late

11:40.500 --> 11:42.102
for my appointment.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.570
I've been having

11:43.603 --> 11:46.206
little premarital
heebie-jeebies.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.408
- You sure you want to do this?
- I'd be lying if I said

11:48.441 --> 11:50.477
I haven't had doubts.

11:50.510 --> 11:53.446
There's just some things,
like, some deep-rooted things

11:53.480 --> 11:55.783
that I'm still
kind of dealing with

11:55.783 --> 11:57.184
and sorting out in my head

11:57.217 --> 11:59.486
that I felt like I should
go to a professional.

11:59.519 --> 12:00.821
Hey, Dr. Engler.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.956
- Great to see you again.
- How you doing, doc?

12:02.990 --> 12:04.958
- Have a seat.
- Good to see you.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.960
- It's good to see you too.
- Thanks for seeing me

12:06.994 --> 12:08.796
on short notice.
- Yes.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.131
- [sighs]
Well, I'm getting married.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.800
- Uh-huh.
- Whoa, yeah.

12:12.800 --> 12:16.036
- That's becoming real now?
- You know--sorry, it's hard.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.871
It's like I--
[laughs]

12:17.905 --> 12:20.140
Um, I feel bad.
I feel like I'm coming--

12:20.173 --> 12:21.608
going behind her back
and talking sh--

12:21.641 --> 12:23.276
about my soon-to-be wife,
you know?

12:23.310 --> 12:24.411
- Right.
- I didn't tell Katie

12:24.444 --> 12:26.579
about going to therapy
because...

12:26.613 --> 12:30.117
there's so many different ways
to upset her,

12:30.150 --> 12:33.921
and I am a little scared
of what she's capable of

12:33.954 --> 12:35.355
when she loses control

12:35.388 --> 12:38.091
and fully goes over
to the dark side.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.828
[sighs] She always
is telling me still, like,

12:40.861 --> 12:42.529
she feels like
I don't have her back.

12:42.562 --> 12:45.365
She seems to always be
in a argument

12:45.398 --> 12:47.667
or talking trash about someone,

12:47.700 --> 12:49.202
and if I try to call her on it,

12:49.236 --> 12:52.339
I get accused of being
self-righteous or an asshole...

12:52.372 --> 12:53.907
- Right.
- And I'm pretty callous.

12:53.941 --> 12:56.509
I'm just like, "Don't f---ing
put me through this again-"

12:56.543 --> 12:58.178
- Right, which--
- "For the 100th time."

12:58.211 --> 12:59.579
- Which probably escalates her,
yeah.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.049
- Oh, my God,
it makes it so much worse.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.852
It's just--yeah, it's our--it's
our long history of ha--I mean,

13:04.852 --> 13:07.254
there's been so many
of these falling outs.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.555
You know, these are chronic,

13:08.588 --> 13:10.924
and Ka--alcohol is always
the catalyst.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.525
- That's the Tom Schwartz
interpretation of things

13:12.559 --> 13:13.994
because you guys
like to hear it.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.595
- No, no, no, no, Tom Schwartz
is reasonable and diplomatic.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.397
- My own boyfriend...
- Like, stop.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.999
- Is standing up
for the whore in there.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.934
- Wait, come here.
- It's always, Katie's drunk.

13:20.968 --> 13:23.470
- Yes, it is your f---ing fault.
- You're the one that needs...

13:23.503 --> 13:24.671
- Why is this the way you talk?
You're just...

13:24.704 --> 13:26.206
- Oh, f---ing f--- off.
- Tom!

13:26.239 --> 13:27.875
- F--- off!

13:27.908 --> 13:29.476
- I don't feel like
I've ever really been able

13:29.509 --> 13:31.678
to articulate clearly
or express to her

13:31.711 --> 13:34.014
just how much I die inside

13:34.047 --> 13:35.382
when she goes to the dark side.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.484
- Right.
- It kills the Schwartz.

13:37.517 --> 13:38.919
- Your homework assignment...
- Hit me with it.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.620
- Is to go home tonight...
- Okay.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.655
- And have your check-in
conversation with Katie.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.457
- Okay, check in.
- And say, "Actually,

13:44.491 --> 13:46.159
"I want to understand your rage.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.895
I want to understand
what makes you feel-"

13:47.895 --> 13:49.262
- Oh, man.
Oh, I don't want to do that.

13:49.296 --> 13:50.998
- "Unsafe in a relationship,"
you know, and--

13:51.031 --> 13:52.265
- Can you come with me?

13:52.299 --> 13:53.934
I almost wish I could
give Katie, like,

13:53.967 --> 13:56.937
some sort of ultimatum
like she gave me, you know?

13:56.970 --> 14:00.040
Either this behavior stops

14:00.073 --> 14:02.309
or we're not getting married,

14:02.342 --> 14:05.445
but I don't have the balls
to do that.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.747
I cannot keep doing this sh--,
you know?

14:07.780 --> 14:09.749
- Okay, so I'm just gonna
ask you the question.

14:09.782 --> 14:10.951
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay.

14:10.984 --> 14:13.120
Are you really ready
to make the commitment

14:13.153 --> 14:15.622
given all of the feelings
you've expressed today?

14:15.655 --> 14:18.625
[soft dramatic music]

14:18.658 --> 14:19.927
*

14:19.927 --> 14:23.763
- Um, I mean, I do have
moments of doubt for sure

14:23.796 --> 14:25.798
where, like--like,
it does flounder.

14:25.832 --> 14:27.767
- Are you sure you want
to get married this summer?

14:27.800 --> 14:28.969
- Yeah.

14:29.002 --> 14:31.071
Yeah.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.940
Yeah.
- I know you feel stuck in this,

14:32.940 --> 14:36.409
and you're not
stuck like this at all.

14:37.744 --> 14:40.713
[electronic music]

14:40.747 --> 14:42.049
*

14:42.082 --> 14:45.052
[indistinct chatter]

14:45.085 --> 14:48.255
*

14:48.288 --> 14:49.656
- How are you?
- I'm good.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.959
- How was your weekend?
- It was pretty good.

14:51.959 --> 14:54.594
Okay, so we've got a party
in the garden tonight.

14:54.627 --> 14:55.862
- Yeah, that's exciting.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.030
- So we've got maybe
an overflow,

14:57.064 --> 14:58.298
so you help the lounge bar.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.167
- Yeah, I'll be there, for sure.
- Yeah.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.534
- Can I just give you a heads up

15:01.568 --> 15:03.136
before you walk into
that room over there?

15:03.170 --> 15:05.572
Because I think Scheana
and Lala went at it.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.407
- Do I really need to hear this?
- 'Cause this is our workplace.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.109
I don't want fighting going on.
Do you want fighting going on?

15:09.142 --> 15:11.511
- You love fighting going on.
You live for fighting going on.

15:11.544 --> 15:13.013
- I'm trying to be
a bigger person here.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.347
I'm trying to, like, tell you--
- That's why you stand there

15:14.381 --> 15:16.249
behind the bar
and spread every bloody rumor

15:16.283 --> 15:18.051
that doesn't even exist.
- It does exist.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.220
Well, here she is.
She can explain to you what's--

15:20.253 --> 15:21.989
- Explain what?
- Explain what happened in there

15:21.989 --> 15:23.790
with Lala coming in and--
well, before she walks in--

15:23.823 --> 15:25.993
- Brittany and I are doing
our roll-ups,

15:26.026 --> 15:27.560
and then Lala walks up
and was like,

15:27.594 --> 15:30.630
"Hey, girls,
how was your weekend?"

15:30.663 --> 15:32.132
- What's wrong with that?
- Like nothing's ever happened.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.200
- We're not friends.
I don't--

15:33.233 --> 15:34.501
- So? Come on, Scheana.
- No, but I--

15:34.534 --> 15:36.203
- It's a workplace.
If she comes in and says,

15:36.236 --> 15:37.437
"Hey, girls," it's okay.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.239
- I know, but Katie hates her.
- Oh, Lord.

15:39.272 --> 15:40.573
- This whole thing--
but I'm saying--

15:40.607 --> 15:42.042
- I can't really
get involved in all this.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.476
- But that's what I'm saying.
- And you stop laughing.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.012
- I think Kristen, Stassi,
and Katie,

15:45.045 --> 15:46.679
like, they share one brain,

15:46.713 --> 15:48.915
and if you don't think
the way they think,

15:49.016 --> 15:51.384
then you can't be part
of that group.

15:51.418 --> 15:52.652
- Katie got mad at me-
- What are you talking about?

15:52.685 --> 15:55.455
- Because I chose
to be professional and cordial

15:55.488 --> 15:57.024
because I'm a forgiving person

15:57.024 --> 15:59.692
who doesn't hold grudges.

15:59.726 --> 16:03.563
- Okay, all I'm asking you to do
is to be civil and cordial

16:03.596 --> 16:04.897
and nice...
- Absolutely.

16:04.931 --> 16:07.667
- And not to make this place
a hostile work environment.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.169
- Absolutely. Absolutely.
- Do you understand that?

16:09.202 --> 16:10.537
- I agree.
- No, you're a sh-- stirrer.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.205
There ain't no two ways
about that.

16:12.239 --> 16:13.840
- That's a good point.
- There will be no issues here

16:13.873 --> 16:14.907
with her and I.

16:14.941 --> 16:18.478
Professional, cordial,
doing my job.

16:18.511 --> 16:21.448
- Go on then.
Go and do it.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.451
[hip-hop music]

16:24.484 --> 16:31.058
*

16:31.091 --> 16:33.060
- I like how you recognize

16:33.060 --> 16:37.397
I'm relaxing right now
because I need to relax.

16:37.430 --> 16:38.698
Butter,

16:38.731 --> 16:41.101
now is not the time, man.
- Hey.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.335
What's going on, bub?

16:42.369 --> 16:44.537
- I'm just doing
some adult coloring, you know?

16:44.571 --> 16:46.073
- Oh.
- This is my unwind time.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.708
I drink my wine.
I color the book.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.743
- Yeah, oh, you're drinking?
- While the--

16:50.777 --> 16:53.813
- Are you drunk?
- Why?

16:53.846 --> 16:55.248
Well, I mean, okay,
I'm not gonna lie.

16:55.282 --> 16:57.117
Like, I did have,
like, some glasses of wine

16:57.150 --> 16:58.451
at lunch with the girls today,

16:58.485 --> 17:01.654
but that doesn't count.
- Oh, um...

17:01.688 --> 17:04.124
Oh, sh--.
- Where have you been?

17:04.157 --> 17:07.794
- [sighs] Well, I actually was
with Dr. Brandy, our therapist.

17:07.827 --> 17:10.563
- You were?
- Yeah, I know.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.532
- How come I didn't know
about this?

17:12.565 --> 17:15.102
- I mean, I don't know.

17:15.102 --> 17:17.770
I had a lot going on in my mind.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.772
I don't--I don't want this
to be, like, a confrontation.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.408
I just was talking and venting,

17:21.441 --> 17:22.975
and I just was like--
I was talking to her,

17:23.009 --> 17:24.277
and I don't think
I ever fully expressed

17:24.311 --> 17:25.678
to you how much,

17:25.712 --> 17:29.282
when you go to the dark side,
it, like, pushes me away.

17:29.316 --> 17:31.118
I mean, how many times
have we had those falling outs

17:31.118 --> 17:32.152
where you've told me
you're not happy,

17:32.185 --> 17:33.253
you don't want to be with me?

17:33.286 --> 17:34.521
Like, I just--sometimes I wonder

17:34.554 --> 17:35.788
if there's, like,
a nugget of truth to that.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.124
- Do you think I would
just put down

17:37.124 --> 17:38.558
a deposit on wedding invitations

17:38.591 --> 17:40.527
if there was a nugget of truth
in something I said

17:40.560 --> 17:42.162
when I was
blackout f---ing drunk?

17:42.195 --> 17:44.364
- But, you've said it 100 times
over the course of--I'm just--

17:44.397 --> 17:45.565
- It's not my fault when I try
to have a conversation...

17:45.598 --> 17:46.999
- Bubby.
- And you don't f---ing

17:47.033 --> 17:48.435
ever listen.

17:48.468 --> 17:49.836
It's like being
in a relationship

17:49.869 --> 17:51.037
with the f---ing wall.

17:51.138 --> 17:54.441
I need Tom to be
a support system

17:54.474 --> 17:56.008
so I know that I'm not alone.

17:56.042 --> 17:58.811
- You have to be self-aware and
admit that when you--you know

17:58.845 --> 18:00.980
when you go to that dark place
it's f---ing scary as hell.

18:01.148 --> 18:02.782
- Yeah, I know--Tom, you've
already paid me back for that.

18:02.815 --> 18:03.883
- Bubba, bubba.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.152
- You've already paid me
back tenfold.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.587
- Bubby, you got to--
first of all, take a breath.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.156
- No, no, you take a breath.
- You're getting--

18:09.189 --> 18:10.623
- We're sitting here planning
a wedding, and you're like,

18:10.657 --> 18:12.159
"Is there, like, smidgen in you
that doesn't want to marry me?"

18:12.159 --> 18:13.293
- Bubba, bubba, bubba.
- And I'm like, "What the f---?"

18:13.326 --> 18:14.661
- No. Well, just--after y--

18:14.694 --> 18:15.795
- You just dropped a bomb on me.
That's what you just did.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.164
- No, I didn't drop a bomb.
Bubba--

18:17.197 --> 18:18.365
- Yeah, you did.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.632
- This is not going
how I planned it to go.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.000
- No, it's not.

18:21.033 --> 18:22.169
- This is supposed to be
a nice, pleasant conversation.

18:22.169 --> 18:23.603
- [stammers]
I should just take it?

18:23.636 --> 18:25.172
- No, you shouldn't just take
it, but can we just talk?

18:25.172 --> 18:26.306
You're gonna be--
like, you're making me feel--

18:26.339 --> 18:27.474
- I'm trying to just have
a conver--this is

18:27.507 --> 18:28.908
how I have a conversation.
- But I just--

18:28.941 --> 18:30.177
I know my therapist is good,

18:30.177 --> 18:33.045
but what she should have
told me is,

18:33.079 --> 18:34.947
"Don't bring a knife
to a gunfight,"

18:34.981 --> 18:37.184
because Katie has me
seriously outgunned.

18:37.184 --> 18:38.551
- I'm sorry that I'm--
- See in your face--

18:38.585 --> 18:39.819
- No, but I'm sorry that
I'm defending myself...

18:39.852 --> 18:41.288
- See? I--
you have been drinking earlier.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.689
I shouldn't have even
brought this up.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.056
- Well, do you have
anything else to say?

18:44.090 --> 18:45.558
Because I'm done talking to you.

18:45.592 --> 18:47.194
- No, bubba, don't be done
talking to me.

18:47.194 --> 18:49.262
- Yup, mm-hmm.
- I don't want to fight.

18:49.296 --> 18:50.463
- Bubby, no.
- Well, it's your fault

18:50.497 --> 18:51.731
for bringing it up, so.

18:51.764 --> 18:54.066
- Bubba, you seem to be focusing
on when I was like--

18:54.100 --> 18:55.302
when I said,
"Is there any doubts?"

18:55.335 --> 18:57.504
Bubby, there's no doubts
on my side at all.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.038
I'm so excited.

18:59.071 --> 19:01.374
I'm in it to win it, you know?

19:01.408 --> 19:03.876
I'm happy, and I'm excited.
Bub?

19:03.910 --> 19:06.413
- 'Kay.
- What do you mean, okay?

19:06.446 --> 19:08.448
Bubby, no.
Don't be upset.

19:08.481 --> 19:11.618
[melancholy music]

19:11.651 --> 19:14.454
That's the last time I ever
try to talk about my feelings.

19:14.487 --> 19:20.960
*

19:20.993 --> 19:22.662
Bubba?

19:24.231 --> 19:25.998
- They need to take an order,
Jax.

19:26.032 --> 19:27.467
They need to take an order.
- You're an--

19:27.500 --> 19:29.936
- You need to get
more cosmopolitan!

19:29.969 --> 19:31.103
[overlapping chatter]

19:35.542 --> 19:36.075
both: * We won't stop

19:37.377 --> 19:40.046
* We're goin' for the gold

19:40.079 --> 19:43.082
* You can't tell us nothin'

19:43.115 --> 19:45.252
- Are you gonna
clean the fish tank?

19:45.285 --> 19:47.153
It's disgusting.
- [sighs]

19:47.254 --> 19:49.356
So I have to pay the bills
and clean?

19:49.389 --> 19:51.558
- Only the fish tank.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.426
- Pay the bills,
clean the apartment,

19:53.460 --> 19:54.661
make my own dinner.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.430
- When have you ever made
your own dinner?

19:57.464 --> 20:00.667
- They don't like it
when I do this, the fishes.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.736
- Why'd you let it get so dirty?
That's your one job.

20:03.770 --> 20:05.705
- Are you actually gonna
start paying bills?

20:05.738 --> 20:07.039
You don't want to work,
that's fine.

20:07.073 --> 20:08.508
I'll pay your bills.
I'll pay everything,

20:08.541 --> 20:10.410
but when I come home
I'd like to have a sandwich.

20:10.443 --> 20:11.678
- Oh, shush.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.646
- I choose
to support my girlfriend

20:13.680 --> 20:15.348
because that's just
how I was raised,

20:15.382 --> 20:16.983
and that being said,

20:17.016 --> 20:19.719
I expect something in return.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.521
If I was a chick,
I'd be like, "F---, man,

20:21.554 --> 20:23.423
I'll make you
25 sandwiches a day."

20:23.456 --> 20:26.192
What time do you have
to go to work?

20:26.225 --> 20:27.927
- We go in
at the same time, honey.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.829
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.464
It's gonna be
a good day for you, huh?

20:31.498 --> 20:33.065
- James isn't working tonight?

20:33.099 --> 20:35.968
- Oh, I don't know.
- I'm gonna kill that kid.

20:36.002 --> 20:39.071
- Jax really wants
to beat the sh-- out of James.

20:39.105 --> 20:40.640
Now that James is--
[pops]

20:40.673 --> 20:43.976
[laughs softly]
Okay.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.878
Jax really, really,
really wants

20:45.912 --> 20:47.947
to beat the sh-- out of James.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.115
I think--
[pops]

20:49.148 --> 20:51.584
[both laugh]

20:51.618 --> 20:54.421
Don't take a deep breath,
Brittany.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.588
Okay.

20:55.622 --> 20:58.425
Jax really wants
to beat the sh-- out of James.

20:58.458 --> 21:01.394
They just have this weird thing
that's back and forth.

21:01.428 --> 21:02.595
He cannot stand him.

21:02.629 --> 21:03.763
The--
[pops]

21:03.796 --> 21:05.865
[laughs]
What is happening?

21:07.334 --> 21:09.702
Are you at least gonna shower
and change your shirt?

21:09.736 --> 21:11.103
- No.

21:11.137 --> 21:13.473
- You're working a shift.
- Yeah, I'm not there

21:13.506 --> 21:15.342
to impress anybody.
I don't give a f---.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.843
- Will you at least
change your shirt?

21:16.876 --> 21:18.545
- I'll just put some
deodorant on and some cologne,

21:18.578 --> 21:19.779
call it a day.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.213
- * Pushin' like an animal

21:21.247 --> 21:23.249
* Hungry like a cannibal

21:23.350 --> 21:24.684
* You control the way...

21:24.717 --> 21:27.954
- My orthodontist told me that
I couldn't, like, eat,

21:27.987 --> 21:30.757
and he's like,
"The champagne diet,"

21:30.790 --> 21:33.426
but I just--
- Uh, can I marry your doctor?

21:33.460 --> 21:34.894
- Scheana was, like, texting me,
and she was like,

21:34.927 --> 21:36.195
"You're gonna hate
the grinding noise," and I'm--

21:36.228 --> 21:37.864
- You were awake?
- I was wide awake,

21:37.897 --> 21:39.899
but they shot my whole mouth up.
- What the m--

21:39.932 --> 21:41.601
- I mean, it's just--
- This is, like, horror stories.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.202
Chin implants all day, erry day.
- No, it's just--

21:43.235 --> 21:44.971
- They gave me Valium.
They gave me nitrous.

21:45.004 --> 21:47.273
- So you're feeling better
than anyone else right now.

21:47.374 --> 21:49.776
I now no longer
feel bad for you.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.878
- So after--like, yesterday,
I come home,

21:51.911 --> 21:53.980
I want to talk to Tom,
and sure enough, he comes home.

21:54.013 --> 21:56.148
He's like, "So I went
and saw Dr. Engler,

21:56.182 --> 21:58.184
the--our therapist."

21:58.217 --> 21:59.952
I'm like, "So what--like,
what'd you talk about?"

21:59.986 --> 22:01.388
He's like,
"You say things, like,

22:01.421 --> 22:03.022
when you--when you're,
like, drunk and upset."

22:03.055 --> 22:04.557
- Everybody does.
- But can I have a drink

22:04.591 --> 22:06.258
without you being like,
"Oh, you're wasted.

22:06.292 --> 22:07.660
"I'm scared of you.
I'm not gonna--"

22:07.694 --> 22:08.895
- Of course.
- Like, that's insulting.

22:08.928 --> 22:10.530
- Well, it's also hypocritical.
- I think

22:10.563 --> 22:11.898
that's what
every man thinks though.

22:11.931 --> 22:14.634
One of the issues
Schwartz has with Katie

22:14.667 --> 22:17.003
is that he's scared of her
when she drinks

22:17.036 --> 22:18.971
because she tends
to fly off the handle,

22:19.005 --> 22:20.573
but it's like, no,
this is just, like, actually,

22:20.607 --> 22:23.676
like, human emotion
and, like, how women are.

22:23.710 --> 22:24.944
[knocks on door]

22:24.977 --> 22:26.879
- You don't have to knock.

22:26.913 --> 22:28.280
No one ever has to knock.
- Hi.

22:28.314 --> 22:30.149
- I didn't know all that.
- It's just polite.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.183
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:31.217 --> 22:33.252
I brought you a liquid,
clear liquid.

22:33.285 --> 22:34.587
- Yes.
- That looks really good.

22:34.621 --> 22:36.122
That's, like,
straight and white.

22:36.155 --> 22:37.457
- Yeah, 'cause I couldn't
explain it to you on the phone,

22:37.490 --> 22:40.192
but these will be smaller,
and these will be bigger.

22:40.226 --> 22:41.594
It just feels weird.
Like--

22:41.628 --> 22:44.931
- Mine still, like, to this day
every day, like, feel different.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.298
- Yeah.

22:46.332 --> 22:48.267
- Because this tooth
I don't actually have anymore,

22:48.300 --> 22:50.770
so I can feel the back
of the veneer, like, the ridge.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.505
I've never had any surgery,

22:52.539 --> 22:54.707
anything cut open
other than my mouth.

22:54.741 --> 22:57.444
The only thing I do is...
[clicks tongue]

22:57.444 --> 22:59.946
I shoot stuff in.
I don't cut stuff apart.

22:59.979 --> 23:02.014
[chuckles]
- Would you like some champagne?

23:02.048 --> 23:03.483
- I'm okay.
Thank you though.

23:03.516 --> 23:05.284
- Okay.
- Wait, okay, can--

23:05.317 --> 23:07.119
Kristen read that text.
Can you--

23:07.153 --> 23:09.188
- Yeah, so Lala, like,
comes over, and she's like,

23:09.221 --> 23:11.958
"Hey, guys.
How was your weekend?"

23:11.991 --> 23:14.060
- Agreeing to be cordial
in any capacity with her,

23:14.093 --> 23:16.496
she's gonna exploit that
and take advantage of it.

23:16.529 --> 23:17.797
- I mean, I don't see her trying

23:17.830 --> 23:19.098
to have another
conversation with me

23:19.131 --> 23:21.468
because what I'll do again
is just walk away.

23:21.468 --> 23:23.736
- I know, but--
- Have a little faith in me.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.672
I'm not a f---ing pushover.
- No, I know, but that's what

23:25.705 --> 23:26.939
I was trying
to address that night.

23:26.973 --> 23:29.175
Kristen, Stassi and I
want to arrive at a place

23:29.208 --> 23:30.543
where Scheana understands

23:30.577 --> 23:32.211
what kind of friend
we need her to be.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.146
If she can do that,
then we can be

23:34.180 --> 23:35.948
the four best friends
that ever were.

23:35.982 --> 23:38.117
Like, I was trying so hard
to not say the wrong thing

23:38.150 --> 23:39.852
or present it in a wrong way
that you would think,

23:39.886 --> 23:41.488
like, I'm attacking you
or anything like that,

23:41.488 --> 23:43.490
but it still, like,
ended up happening.

23:43.490 --> 23:45.391
I don't want you to be,
like, hurt

23:45.492 --> 23:47.827
because I'm trying to, like,
con--like, confront you about

23:47.860 --> 23:50.029
not an "issue"
but just something that,

23:50.062 --> 23:51.498
like, didn't sit with me well.

23:51.498 --> 23:52.999
- This is not meant to be mean.
I don't want you to ta--

23:53.032 --> 23:54.501
I know when people
preface something like that

23:54.501 --> 23:55.968
it sounds like
it's about to be mean,

23:56.002 --> 23:58.137
but, like, for real, I mean--
I don't mean this to be mean.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.006
You have an issue with this,

24:00.039 --> 24:02.141
and I feel like
if I communicate that with you,

24:02.174 --> 24:04.511
you're gonna think
that I'm coming at you,

24:04.544 --> 24:05.712
and that's not what, like,

24:05.745 --> 24:07.514
a real, solid friendship
is like.

24:07.514 --> 24:09.949
- I know that you're
super sensitive.

24:09.982 --> 24:11.250
It's a thing that works
against you,

24:11.283 --> 24:12.819
and it's the thing
I love the most about you.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.320
- But that's why--that's why I--
that's--yeah because--

24:14.353 --> 24:15.855
- I didn't know I was coming
over to get attacked, jeez.

24:15.888 --> 24:17.023
all: But you're not.
- Because we're sitting here

24:17.056 --> 24:18.691
telling you
how much we love you.

24:18.725 --> 24:21.393
- I have told these girls
numerous times

24:21.427 --> 24:23.095
that I feel like
it's three against one,

24:23.129 --> 24:24.897
and they're always like,
"No, no, no, Scheana,

24:24.931 --> 24:26.733
it's not like that,"
when I'm like,

24:26.766 --> 24:28.768
"You guys, this is exactly
what I was talking about."

24:28.801 --> 24:31.704
- I just had a feeling
that may--

24:31.738 --> 24:34.373
you made it a little more like,
"it's all good."

24:34.406 --> 24:35.975
- No, but you guys
jumped way ahead.

24:36.008 --> 24:37.143
You're like, "Oh, now, like,

24:37.176 --> 24:38.678
Ariana's gonna invite you
to lunch,

24:38.711 --> 24:40.312
and then Lala's gonna be there,
and then--" I'm like, that--no?

24:40.346 --> 24:42.782
- But, like, I feel like you
should have, like, known better.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.851
- And that's not how I meant
for it to come off,

24:44.884 --> 24:46.452
so I apologize.
- See?

24:46.553 --> 24:48.688
That's all--like, I was not,
like, mad at you,

24:48.721 --> 24:50.557
but I was just like, I have to,
like, let her know this

24:50.590 --> 24:52.559
so it doesn't, like, snowball
and I don't get frustrated.

24:52.559 --> 24:54.426
- So whenever we have
an issue with each other

24:54.460 --> 24:56.729
from here on out,
you confront each other

24:56.763 --> 24:59.566
in a constructive way
even if we're drinking.

24:59.566 --> 25:02.602
- Yeah.
- Communication for the win.

25:03.603 --> 25:05.437
[techno music]

25:05.471 --> 25:08.440
[indistinct chatter]

25:08.474 --> 25:13.946
*

25:13.980 --> 25:15.682
- Oh, we're--
- I'm not allowed to.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.950
- Okay I'm just gonna set it
here so you can pretend.

25:17.984 --> 25:19.752
- You know, obviously,
I know that Lisa's told me

25:19.786 --> 25:21.087
"Don't drink before work."

25:21.120 --> 25:23.189
[indistinct chatter]

25:23.222 --> 25:25.157
Mmm.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.093
*

25:27.126 --> 25:29.729
But I don't feel like
it's a big issue

25:29.762 --> 25:32.632
to be a little buzzy.
Is it vodka?

25:32.665 --> 25:35.635
- Lemon drop.
- Lemon drop.

25:35.668 --> 25:37.203
both: Whoo!

25:37.236 --> 25:38.638
- I feel like James
is just getting worse.

25:38.671 --> 25:39.772
I just don't know
how he gets away

25:39.806 --> 25:41.240
with half the sh-- he does.

25:41.273 --> 25:44.911
[soft dramatic music]

25:44.944 --> 25:46.245
[sighs]
I'm tired.

25:46.278 --> 25:48.681
- Look, I wrote down...

25:48.715 --> 25:51.483
stuff for wine
in case Lisa asks me.

25:51.517 --> 25:54.053
- Table 16 I just sat--
- Table 16?

25:54.086 --> 25:56.088
- Yeah, it's, like, the big one
with six people.

25:56.122 --> 25:58.157
- Oh, okay.
Okay.

25:58.190 --> 25:59.525
- I've been here six years.
I couldn't tell you

25:59.626 --> 26:00.793
any of the number
of the tables.

26:00.827 --> 26:02.194
- I always look
at the computer still.

26:02.228 --> 26:03.663
- [laughs]
Okay.

26:03.696 --> 26:04.997
- Wait, before you go
over there,

26:05.031 --> 26:06.332
can I talk to you
about something?

26:06.365 --> 26:07.967
- Yeah.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.002
- I've been like really nervous
to work on Wednesdays lately.

26:10.036 --> 26:12.705
- Why?
- 'Cause James DJs,

26:12.739 --> 26:14.540
and in April--

26:14.641 --> 26:17.109
like, the beginning of April,
we hooked up.

26:17.143 --> 26:18.645
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Well, I didn't--

26:18.645 --> 26:19.979
- Wait.
- [laughs]

26:20.012 --> 26:21.914
- He's been dating a girl
since New Year's, I thought.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.082
- I didn't know that.

26:23.115 --> 26:24.917
I just started working here
in February,

26:24.951 --> 26:26.352
and I didn't know he had
a girlfriend,

26:26.385 --> 26:28.287
but when I found out,
I called it off.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.322
And I was keeping my mouth shut.
I didn't want any drama.

26:30.356 --> 26:32.158
- You told me.
You told the wrong person.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.026
- Oh, everybody knows now,
and I'll tell you why.

26:34.060 --> 26:36.228
He, like,
flipped out on me at Pump.

26:36.262 --> 26:37.730
- It was that the night he got--
like, got his--

26:37.764 --> 26:40.332
went crazy on everybody?
- Well, he went crazy on me.

26:40.366 --> 26:41.668
- He went crazy on you?
- No, but--yeah.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.035
Like, calling me a whore.
Like--

26:43.069 --> 26:44.370
- Every day I hear something
about this kid.

26:44.403 --> 26:45.504
Every single day.

26:45.537 --> 26:47.774
You know, Sur used to be
a fun place to work,

26:47.807 --> 26:49.308
but since James started
working here,

26:49.341 --> 26:50.476
everyone's crying.

26:50.509 --> 26:51.944
Everyone's fighting
with each other.

26:51.978 --> 26:53.746
Can't this place just go back
to the way it used to be?

26:53.780 --> 26:55.581
- Sorry I've been
f---ing you every day

26:55.682 --> 26:57.684
without protection
and been inside of you.

26:57.684 --> 26:58.885
- Are you really gonna do this
with people here?

26:58.918 --> 27:00.687
- Yeah, I am.
F--- you.

27:00.687 --> 27:02.689
- And it's really
disrespectful to Lisa.

27:02.722 --> 27:04.290
- So does his girlfriend know?

27:04.323 --> 27:05.758
- No, his girlfriend
doesn't know,

27:05.792 --> 27:07.326
but that's not my--
- Oh, she's gonna find out.

27:07.359 --> 27:08.728
- She will know
now that he knows.

27:08.761 --> 27:11.263
- [laughs]
But that's not my goal anyway.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.999
- It's my goal.
- He--

27:13.032 --> 27:14.233
- Yeah.

27:14.266 --> 27:16.335
- It's my goal to ruin
that kid's life.

27:16.368 --> 27:19.271
- They're thirsty,
thirsty little girls

27:19.305 --> 27:20.606
that need a drink.

27:20.707 --> 27:22.474
- You are turning
into an asshole

[techno music]

27:30.983 --> 27:34.086
*

27:34.120 --> 27:35.855
- Okay, take your time.
Take your time.

27:35.888 --> 27:39.191
*

27:39.225 --> 27:40.793
- I got--
got some information today.

27:40.827 --> 27:41.961
- Oh, you did?
- I found out--

27:41.994 --> 27:43.129
well, one of the hostesses, GG,

27:43.162 --> 27:44.496
she comes up to me,
and she's like,

27:44.530 --> 27:47.099
"Listen, James has been
kind of calling me names

27:47.133 --> 27:48.334
and calling me whore,"
and all this

27:48.367 --> 27:49.736
and, like,
verbally attacking her

27:49.769 --> 27:51.570
because he doesn't want her
to tell everybody

27:51.603 --> 27:53.105
that he cheated
on his girlfriend.

27:53.139 --> 27:56.075
- That sounds like
when Brittany came into town.

27:56.108 --> 27:57.576
- And you--then you started
calling Lala--

27:57.609 --> 27:59.746
- What you did with Lala.
- Own up to the sh--

27:59.746 --> 28:01.380
that you said in my ear.
- I never said anything.

28:01.413 --> 28:03.349
- You said,
"I promise I'm gonna f--- you."

28:03.382 --> 28:06.218
- No, I never said that.

28:06.252 --> 28:08.755
- Maybe one of the reasons
why Jax doesn't like James

28:08.755 --> 28:10.890
is 'cause he feels like
he's looking at himself

28:10.923 --> 28:12.024
ten years ago,

28:12.058 --> 28:14.226
and he doesn't like
what he sees.

28:14.260 --> 28:17.830
- I--I think he's surpassed me
in douchiness.

28:17.864 --> 28:19.065
- They got, like,
nothing tonight,

28:19.098 --> 28:20.532
so I wanted to give them
big parties,

28:20.566 --> 28:23.269
but whenever they're done,
I'm gonna seat them there.

28:23.302 --> 28:24.871
- Okay, perfect.

28:24.904 --> 28:26.405
Are you good for just a minute?
- Yeah.

28:26.438 --> 28:28.007
Okay.

DJ James Kennedy.

28:32.444 --> 28:33.846
What's up, homes?

28:33.880 --> 28:36.682
- Do you like my swag tonight?
- I love your swag every night.

28:36.783 --> 28:39.351
So can I ask you
a solid question?

28:39.385 --> 28:42.088
- About what?
- I have heard

28:42.121 --> 28:43.522
some things around here...
- What?

28:43.555 --> 28:46.859
- That you've been hooking up
with other chicks.

28:46.893 --> 28:48.795
- Well, I just want
people here...

28:48.795 --> 28:51.030
- Right.
- To know the truth.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.364
- Is that happening,
or is that not happening?

28:52.398 --> 28:53.632
- No.
With who?

28:53.665 --> 28:55.802
- You would tell me the truth?
- With who?

28:55.802 --> 28:58.670
- GG.
- That blonde girl?

28:58.704 --> 28:59.939
- No, she has brunette hair.
- No.

28:59.972 --> 29:02.574
I wouldn't f--- GG
with a 10-foot pole.

29:02.608 --> 29:05.644
I mean, I'm here driving around
an Aston Martin.

29:05.677 --> 29:08.514
You think I'm gonna jump in this
Honda Civic for a quick joyride?

29:08.547 --> 29:09.949
Me and Raquel love each other.
- I know you do.

29:09.982 --> 29:11.918
- Come at me,
any desperado bitch

29:11.951 --> 29:14.020
that wants to become someone.
- Keep your voice down.

29:14.053 --> 29:15.587
Hey, you don't need to say--
stop with the cursing.

29:15.621 --> 29:17.089
- Nobody's talking to you.
- Nobody's talking to you.

29:17.123 --> 29:18.490
- Be quiet.
You're talking to me.

29:18.524 --> 29:19.826
- You're nobody.
You're nobody.

29:19.826 --> 29:21.360
- Nobody's talking to you.
- You're nobody.

29:21.393 --> 29:22.628
- Then stop talking to me
if I'm nobody.

29:22.661 --> 29:24.030
- Go--go sling some more d---
for Range Rovers.

29:24.063 --> 29:26.498
Yeah.
- Asshole.

29:26.532 --> 29:27.733
- GG said you hooked up
with her,

29:27.834 --> 29:29.001
and then were calling her
a slut and whore.

29:29.035 --> 29:30.202
- DJ on, JK.

29:30.236 --> 29:32.471
- Jax, Jax, Jax, Jax,
what are you doing?

29:32.504 --> 29:33.906
- I'm asking what--I want
to know what the problem is.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.341
- What are you doing?
- I can do whatever I want.

29:35.374 --> 29:36.909
- You don't care.
- Yes, I do.

29:36.943 --> 29:38.410
- But why?
- Do you want more sangria?

29:38.444 --> 29:40.279
- She's upset.
- Red, white.

29:40.312 --> 29:42.849
- You're--you're working at Sur.
You're working.

29:42.849 --> 29:44.383
- There's no--
- Don't come at me and say,

29:44.416 --> 29:45.852
"Oh, my God.
Oh, no, so this--

29:45.852 --> 29:47.386
- I'm gonna come at you whenever
I feel like coming at you.

29:47.419 --> 29:48.620
- Why?

29:48.654 --> 29:49.922
- You're kicked out
of everywhere you go.

29:49.956 --> 29:51.357
You can't go a day
without getting your ass kicked.

29:51.390 --> 29:52.624
- 'Cause I'm a rock star,
and you're a bartender.

29:52.658 --> 29:53.860
- A rock star?

29:53.893 --> 29:55.261
Anybody can push play
on a laptop, you idiot.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.428
- In Vegas?

29:56.462 --> 29:57.729
- It's not even connected
to anything.

29:57.763 --> 29:59.565
- They need to take an order,
Jax.

29:59.598 --> 30:00.967
They need to take an order.
- You're--

30:01.000 --> 30:04.971
- You need to get more
cosmopolitans.

30:05.004 --> 30:07.306
Pop-tini!

30:07.339 --> 30:11.043
*

30:11.077 --> 30:12.378
- Hi.

30:12.411 --> 30:14.914
*

30:14.947 --> 30:17.049
- What up, dude?
- Lookin' good, dude.

30:17.083 --> 30:19.251
- You look handsome.
- Thanks, man.

30:19.285 --> 30:21.320
- I don't know about
that man bun, but...

30:21.353 --> 30:23.222
- It's not a man bun, dude.
- We can talk about it.

30:23.255 --> 30:25.724
If I get drunk enough,
I'm gonna snip that thing off.

30:25.757 --> 30:27.226
- So what you been up to?
What you--

30:27.259 --> 30:29.428
- Dude, I don't even
know what happened yesterday.

30:29.461 --> 30:31.998
I went to therapy.
I left feeling good,

30:32.031 --> 30:33.532
and I went back home,
and I wanted to have, like,

30:33.565 --> 30:35.834
a little, like, state
of the relationship address,

30:35.868 --> 30:37.904
you know what I mean?
- Yeah?

30:37.937 --> 30:41.640
- Dude, it did not
go over well at all,

30:41.673 --> 30:42.942
and I told her--I was like,

30:42.975 --> 30:44.710
"That's the last time
I express my feelings.

30:44.743 --> 30:47.346
They're going right back down
where they belong."

30:47.379 --> 30:49.515
- I really, truly don't think

30:49.548 --> 30:51.984
that Katie has any concept

30:52.018 --> 30:55.654
on how damaging it is
to Schwartz

30:55.687 --> 30:57.189
when she goes to the dark side.

30:57.223 --> 30:59.758
- Anyways, I don't want
to bore you with all that sh--.

30:59.791 --> 31:01.961
I know we were joking around
about it before,

31:01.994 --> 31:04.396
but I think I'm actually gonna
have Ariana be a groomsman.

31:04.430 --> 31:05.965
Like, seriously.

31:05.998 --> 31:07.533
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, why not?

31:07.566 --> 31:10.036
- That's f---ing awesome.
- Katie doesn't want Ariana

31:10.069 --> 31:11.938
to be a bridesmaid
for several reasons,

31:11.938 --> 31:14.273
including the fact
that she's friends with Lala.

31:14.306 --> 31:15.942
What if she actually
was a groomsman?

31:15.975 --> 31:18.144
- She and Lala have, like,
gotten closer as friends

31:18.177 --> 31:21.513
like, right in the middle of her
talking all this sh--.

31:21.547 --> 31:25.317
- So, you know, for the moment
I'm gonna avoid telling her.

31:25.351 --> 31:27.987
I brought her an ass steak
and some ass shrimp, you know.

31:28.020 --> 31:30.389
- I mean, fair is fair.

31:30.422 --> 31:31.823
- [laughs]
All right.

31:31.857 --> 31:35.227
*

31:35.261 --> 31:36.328
- Are you almost done?

31:36.362 --> 31:39.365
[indistinct chatter]

31:40.967 --> 31:42.734
- Hold on, hold on, no, no.

31:42.768 --> 31:45.071
- Scarf.
- It's af--it's after--

31:45.104 --> 31:46.172
this is the girl,
all right?

31:46.205 --> 31:47.739
- Oh, what? What? What?
- GG.

31:47.773 --> 31:48.975
- What have you been
saying about me?

31:49.008 --> 31:50.276
- What have you been saying
about me,

31:50.309 --> 31:51.643
that I'm obsessed with you?
- Nothing at all.

31:51.677 --> 31:52.979
We can't shout.
- If you wanna start a problem

31:52.979 --> 31:54.513
with me because you
hooked up with me, and you--

31:54.546 --> 31:56.215
- No, I didn't hook up
with you ever.

31:56.248 --> 31:58.850
- James, you are actually
a f---ing psychopath.

31:58.884 --> 32:00.152
- You're being unacceptable
and very rude.

32:00.186 --> 32:01.487
- Go ahead.
You're always drunk.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.022
You have no talent.

32:03.055 --> 32:04.390
- Why?
That's not what you said--

32:04.423 --> 32:05.691
- It's so embarrassing.
- What are you talking about?

32:05.724 --> 32:07.093
- That's not what I said when,
at your house?

32:07.126 --> 32:08.227
- At Pump when you--
- At your house? At your house?

32:08.260 --> 32:10.662
- When you come to Pump
every f---ing time.

32:10.696 --> 32:12.264
- At your house.

32:12.298 --> 32:14.800
- At your house.

32:14.833 --> 32:17.003
- He's drunk.
- GG.

32:17.003 --> 32:18.037
- Okay.

32:18.070 --> 32:20.206
- I don't care
if they f---ed or not.

32:20.239 --> 32:22.541
The only thing
that I can think about is,

32:22.574 --> 32:25.177
"Thank God rumors
are being spread

32:25.211 --> 32:27.446
about somebody that is not me."

32:27.479 --> 32:30.216
[dramatic music]

32:30.249 --> 32:32.018
- Hey.
- Hi, Lisa.

32:32.018 --> 32:34.753
- Everything good?
- Everything's great.

32:34.786 --> 32:39.591
*

32:39.625 --> 32:41.260
- Hey.
- Hi, Lisa.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.062
- Ooh.
- How's it going?

32:43.095 --> 32:44.430
- It's going.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.798
I wouldn't mind a glass of rosÃ©.
- Hello, hello.

32:46.832 --> 32:48.234
- Hello.
- How are you?

32:48.267 --> 32:49.835
- Okay.
What's happening?

32:49.868 --> 32:52.638
- We might need to talk outside,
away from people.

32:52.671 --> 32:55.474
- Okay, let's talk outside.
I'll be out on the terrace.

32:55.507 --> 32:57.409
Diana saying,
"Hey, can I talk to you,"

32:57.443 --> 32:59.045
is never a good thing.

32:59.045 --> 33:00.479
Come on, sit here.
Tell me.

33:00.512 --> 33:01.647
- Well, I--

33:01.680 --> 33:03.482
- Tell me your
objective opinion.

33:03.515 --> 33:06.052
- [chuckles]
When I came to the bar,

33:06.085 --> 33:08.720
I was just hearing the yelling.
- Yelling?

33:08.754 --> 33:11.090
- James screaming
out of his lungs.

33:11.123 --> 33:13.792
He's so obnoxious,
the way of, like, clappy hands,

33:13.825 --> 33:16.162
his screaming,
and people were looking at that,

33:16.195 --> 33:18.230
and this is representing you.

33:18.264 --> 33:20.399
- Okay, let me see
what's going on.

33:20.432 --> 33:22.101
- You want to talk to him?
- Well, yeah, send him out.

33:22.134 --> 33:24.570
- I'll be right back.
- Sometimes I walk in,

33:24.603 --> 33:26.638
and everything's
absolutely copacetic,

33:26.672 --> 33:29.708
and then other times I walk in,
and James is being an asshole.

33:29.741 --> 33:31.477
This is one of those nights.

33:31.510 --> 33:32.644
- Hi.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.413
- What on earth is going
on with you?

33:34.446 --> 33:36.615
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

33:36.648 --> 33:38.717
- Nothing at all.
- No raised voices?

33:38.750 --> 33:41.087
- Nope.
- James.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.721
- [laughs]
What?

33:42.754 --> 33:44.690
It's petty drama
that these bitches are--

33:44.723 --> 33:46.358
- Shh, don't talk like that.

33:46.392 --> 33:48.727
- Why?

33:48.760 --> 33:50.762
- You don't even
understand the difference

33:50.796 --> 33:52.531
between a civilized
conversation and being--

33:52.564 --> 33:54.400
- They're thirsty,
thirsty little girls

33:54.433 --> 33:56.202
that need a drink,

33:56.235 --> 33:59.138
and I can't provide water
for them.

33:59.171 --> 34:03.109
- You are turning into
an asshole before my very eyes.

34:05.244 --> 34:06.612
- There is a catch.

34:06.645 --> 34:08.280
- What's the catch?
- There's a catch.

34:13.419 --> 34:13.785
[dramatic music]

34:17.256 --> 34:19.125
- You don't even understand
the difference

34:19.125 --> 34:20.959
between a civilized conversation
and being--

34:20.992 --> 34:22.828
- They're thirsty,
thirsty little girls

34:22.861 --> 34:24.630
that need a drink,

34:24.663 --> 34:27.533
and I can't provide
water for them.

34:27.566 --> 34:30.836
- You are turning into
an asshole before my very eyes.

34:30.869 --> 34:32.238
- All right, Lisa.

34:32.271 --> 34:33.939
You're obviously feeding into

34:33.972 --> 34:36.508
what everybody else
is telling you,

34:36.542 --> 34:39.044
and I don't appreciate that.

34:40.646 --> 34:42.681
- We've invested a lot
in this kid

34:42.714 --> 34:45.984
and really kind of put our necks
on the line for him,

34:46.017 --> 34:47.719
and this is the way
he repays us.

34:47.753 --> 34:49.020
You're not Calvin Harris.

34:49.054 --> 34:50.956
- Oh, who said that?
- Well, you think you are.

34:50.989 --> 34:53.625
- Where did you learn that from?
It's ridiculous.

34:53.659 --> 34:55.527
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do.

34:55.561 --> 34:58.029
- No, I don't.
- When you're creating a problem

34:58.063 --> 34:59.531
and you're raising your voice
in my business,

34:59.565 --> 35:01.967
I can assure you,
you need to calm down.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.969
- No one's out here.

35:04.002 --> 35:06.705
No one--no one's around us.

35:06.738 --> 35:09.208
- Go back to the boo--
- No, but--okay, fine.

35:09.241 --> 35:10.642
If you want me to go back
and you don't want

35:10.676 --> 35:13.412
to talk to me respectfully,
I need to tell you the truth.

35:13.445 --> 35:15.214
- I've had enough.
Go back to the DJ booth.

35:15.247 --> 35:18.450
- Why?
- Play your little discs

35:18.484 --> 35:21.753
and shut up.
Do you understand me?

35:21.787 --> 35:23.889
Because you are one stage

35:23.922 --> 35:26.024
from me telling you to go home,

35:26.057 --> 35:28.394
and you don't want that.
- Lisa, I love you so much.

35:28.427 --> 35:30.028
- Doesn't matter.
- I respect you so much.

35:30.061 --> 35:32.431
- Well, then show me respect
and do exactly what I said now.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.533
Go back to the DJ booth.

- Dabble, dabble, Deezy.
- Hey.

35:49.315 --> 35:51.217
- What's going on?
- Not much.

35:51.217 --> 35:52.684
- I came in to say
what's up to the guys.

35:52.718 --> 35:54.119
- How's it going?

35:54.220 --> 35:55.687
- Do you know that I feel like
I've been neglecting Sur lately?

35:55.721 --> 35:57.122
- I came out here for a break,

35:57.223 --> 35:59.825
and then I realized it was,
like, 45 degrees out here, so.

35:59.858 --> 36:03.128
- Oh, um, there's another reason
I came here,

36:03.229 --> 36:05.231
and it involves you.

36:05.231 --> 36:06.232
- Okay.
- Yeah.

36:06.265 --> 36:07.833
I'm not quite sure
how to say this,

36:07.866 --> 36:09.768
but, uh...

36:09.801 --> 36:12.638
I think I want you
to officially be a groomsman.

36:12.671 --> 36:15.707
- Oh, my God.
That's so cool.

36:15.741 --> 36:17.243
- Take it in.
- Get over here.

36:17.276 --> 36:20.246
I've never been a groomsman
in anyone's wedding.

36:20.279 --> 36:23.882
I've been a bridesmaid
a jillion times,

36:23.915 --> 36:26.952
but, like, it's just so cool
that he would think of me,

36:26.985 --> 36:29.855
and I'm super excited
to wear a suit.

36:29.888 --> 36:31.790
- There is a catch.
- What's the catch?

36:31.823 --> 36:33.725
- There's a catch.

36:33.759 --> 36:36.127
As you remember,
I made Tom and Jax

36:36.161 --> 36:38.930
a nice dinner,
a very special dinner.

36:38.964 --> 36:42.067
- You ate steaks that were
between my ass cheeks.

36:42.100 --> 36:43.802
I feel good.

36:43.835 --> 36:46.805
I like Ariana,
and I want her to be included,

36:46.838 --> 36:49.275
so, you know, eat my ass steak.

36:49.275 --> 36:50.942
Eat my ass shrimp.

36:50.976 --> 36:54.613
Oh, this is commitment.

36:54.646 --> 36:57.082
This is real groomsmanship.

36:57.115 --> 37:00.151

37:00.185 --> 37:02.621
Dude, you--

37:02.654 --> 37:04.956
officially, officially
a groomsman.

37:04.990 --> 37:06.292
- This is, like,
the coolest thing

37:06.292 --> 37:08.627
that's ever happened to me.

just still doing here?

37:23.975 --> 37:25.143

these bars?

37:26.878 --> 37:28.680

- Can I get a shot?

37:28.714 --> 37:29.848
- I mean--

37:29.881 --> 37:31.317
- I mean, you want
to do one together?

37:31.350 --> 37:34.052
- If you're leaving.
- I'm leaving. I'm off.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.355
Look at me.
Seriously.

37:36.388 --> 37:38.857
- Dude, I just want you
to keep your job here.

37:38.890 --> 37:40.326
- My job's kept.

37:40.326 --> 37:43.962
- Good.
- I'm a most valuable player.

37:43.995 --> 37:46.097
- You're MVP?
MVP of Sur?

37:46.131 --> 37:48.667
- Most valuable player, yeah,
I think so.

37:48.700 --> 37:50.101
Sorry it's me, Jax.

37:50.135 --> 37:53.204
- I'm cool with James,
but he's a lot.

37:53.238 --> 37:55.173
One too many glasses
of chardonnay,

37:55.206 --> 37:57.676
and he's f---ing a lot.

37:57.709 --> 37:59.611
No, dude, I--
- Thomas, listen to me.

37:59.645 --> 38:00.946
Look at me.
What are you looking for?

38:00.979 --> 38:02.848
- Looking for my towel.
- Whiskey's what you're

38:02.881 --> 38:04.215
looking for.
I don't see Lisa anywhere.

38:04.249 --> 38:05.584
- Looking for my towel,
I'm looking for my towel.

38:05.617 --> 38:08.354
F--- it.
Let's do some babies.

38:08.387 --> 38:10.589
- You gonna do Jack
over Black Label back there?

38:10.622 --> 38:12.023
- Right?
- Jack? Cheers.

38:12.057 --> 38:13.892
- Cheers, man.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.228
- Go back to the DJ booth.

38:17.262 --> 38:19.230
[tense music]

38:19.264 --> 38:22.233
I'm serious.
I don't care.

38:22.267 --> 38:24.970
- Well, we're--
we are "technically" closed.

38:25.003 --> 38:26.271
- This is crazy.
- Huh?

38:26.372 --> 38:29.174
- This is crazy.
- He's good.

38:34.913 --> 38:37.015
- You've got to put your foot
down with him.

38:37.048 --> 38:38.584
- No, I know.
I'm just talking to him.

38:38.617 --> 38:40.085
We're just--
we're just shooting the sh--.

38:40.118 --> 38:42.388
- You're older, wiser, smarter.
Tell him.

38:42.388 --> 38:44.022
- All right, all right.

38:44.055 --> 38:47.393
*

38:47.393 --> 38:49.461
[sighs]
Well.

38:49.495 --> 38:51.763
- What is the issue?
- See?

38:51.797 --> 38:53.699
- Oh, my God.
You guys.

38:56.301 --> 38:57.936
- I didn't.
I didn't.

38:57.969 --> 39:00.138
- No, I'm not.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.708
- You sound very drunk.
- Wait, no.

39:02.741 --> 39:05.243
Guys, it's not about
the drinks tonight.

39:05.276 --> 39:07.112
- Lisa, I promise you.

39:08.747 --> 39:10.416
- He is.
- I said sorry.

39:10.416 --> 39:11.517
[crying]
I won't do it again.

39:11.550 --> 39:12.918
- See what he's like?

39:12.951 --> 39:14.653
- Please, Ken's getting mad.

39:14.686 --> 39:17.656
Lisa, stop.
He's gonna get mad at me.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.859
- Ken scares the sh-- out of me.
- Shh.

39:20.892 --> 39:22.060
- Oh, my God.

39:22.093 --> 39:23.862
I can't deal with this
f---ing bullsh--.

39:23.895 --> 39:25.997
- See?
- What?

39:26.031 --> 39:27.332
What?
Ken, look--

39:33.739 --> 39:36.442
- I would never
disrespect your wife, Ken.

39:36.442 --> 39:38.610
- Go home.

39:38.644 --> 39:40.812
- All right.

39:40.846 --> 39:42.448
That's a wrap.

39:43.782 --> 39:46.685
- What do you have to say
for yourself

39:46.718 --> 39:47.986
after last night?

39:53.759 --> 39:54.125
[dramatic music]

39:56.728 --> 40:03.368
*

40:03.401 --> 40:07.205
- It's not a good look to get
into fights at Lisa's spots,

40:07.238 --> 40:09.374
so I've got to say my apologies

40:09.407 --> 40:11.042
and get back to work.

40:11.076 --> 40:12.811
Hello.
- Hey, James.

40:12.844 --> 40:14.880
- What's up?
- Hey, didn't know you were

40:14.913 --> 40:16.181
gonna come here.
- You all right?

40:16.214 --> 40:17.315
- I'm actually just leaving.
- Are you gonna--

40:17.348 --> 40:18.584
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

40:18.617 --> 40:20.051
- Okay.
- I got to go to work.

40:20.085 --> 40:21.453
- All right, well,
have a good night.

40:21.487 --> 40:23.388
- You too.
- All right, darling.

40:23.421 --> 40:26.692
- I love you, mom.
- All right, love you too.

40:26.725 --> 40:28.794
- It's a beautiful setup
out here.

40:28.827 --> 40:30.328
- Mm-hmm.
- Looks gorgeous.

40:30.361 --> 40:33.198
- What do you have to say
for yourself

40:33.231 --> 40:34.833
after last night?

40:34.866 --> 40:36.568
- I've never been so scared
in my life, to be honest.

40:36.602 --> 40:38.670
- What's happened to you?
What's happened to the boy

40:38.704 --> 40:40.371
that we knew three years ago?

40:41.907 --> 40:43.008
- Hi, Lisa, how are you?
- Hello.

40:43.041 --> 40:44.576
I see you're
doing your job properly.

40:44.610 --> 40:46.912
- Yes, Peter is making it
very clear

40:46.945 --> 40:49.080
that these need
to be extra polished.

40:49.114 --> 40:51.483
- And now you've turned into,
like, really,

40:51.517 --> 40:54.319
a-a drunken asshole.

40:54.352 --> 40:56.354
*

40:56.387 --> 40:58.890
- What do I do?
- I'll tell you what you do,

40:58.924 --> 41:01.593
and I tell you,
I am drawing a line in the sand.

41:01.627 --> 41:04.830
You are not working
for me any longer,

41:04.863 --> 41:06.231
and you're not coming into Sur,

41:06.264 --> 41:08.934
and you're not coming into Pump.

41:10.836 --> 41:13.371
- You know,
indefinitely fired forever

41:13.404 --> 41:16.007
just sounds crazy.

41:16.041 --> 41:18.176
I just don--
- Your behavior warrants it.

41:18.209 --> 41:19.377
I've given you more chances

41:19.410 --> 41:22.981
than I've ever given
anybody else ever.

41:23.014 --> 41:24.616
- On one hand, Jax is
a f---ing wanker,

41:24.650 --> 41:26.918
and GG's a f---ing whore,
but on the other hand,

41:26.952 --> 41:28.554
I let them
get the best of my emotions.

41:28.554 --> 41:31.156
You know, am I at fault?
Yeah, but they're at fault

41:31.189 --> 41:32.624
for being f---ing assholes
as well.

41:32.658 --> 41:33.959
- I think it's
for your own good.

41:33.992 --> 41:37.328
You've got to sober up.
- [exhales sharply]

41:37.362 --> 41:40.632
It's so hard though.
[crying]

41:40.666 --> 41:42.834
It really is, Lisa.

41:42.868 --> 41:46.638
I don't know how to control it.

41:46.672 --> 41:48.439
- You should never have
another drink in your life.

41:48.473 --> 41:50.776
That's who you are.

41:50.809 --> 41:53.779
[somber music]

41:53.812 --> 41:56.782
*

41:56.815 --> 41:59.317
Go.

41:59.350 --> 42:01.820
- Okay.
All right.

42:01.853 --> 42:06.892
*

42:06.925 --> 42:10.295
I have stood by James
as much as I possibly could.

42:10.328 --> 42:12.831
I will always support James,

42:12.864 --> 42:14.933
but I refuse to enable him.

42:14.966 --> 42:16.367
- [sighs]

42:16.401 --> 42:19.404
[crying]

42:21.472 --> 42:23.809
- Next time
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:23.842 --> 42:25.611
- He didn't instigate that...
- Yes, he did.

42:25.611 --> 42:28.113
- No, you provoked it.
- I provoked it?

42:28.146 --> 42:30.916
- Shut up for a second
and let me finish.

42:30.949 --> 42:32.483
- Do you know

42:32.517 --> 42:35.086
how many things
I have heard about you?

42:35.120 --> 42:36.788
- You know how many things
I've heard about you, Lala?

42:36.822 --> 42:38.389
'Cause I've had
all the girls ask me

42:38.423 --> 42:39.725
if you're seeing a married man.

42:39.758 --> 42:40.926
- It's not that
I'm being secretive.

42:40.959 --> 42:41.960
It's for my own well-being.
- You are.

42:41.993 --> 42:43.929
You haven't told one person.

42:43.962 --> 42:45.130
- How are you two getting on?

42:45.163 --> 42:47.365
- We've had a few
little flare-ups.

42:47.398 --> 42:49.635
Cool, Tom, do you want
to insult me more?

42:49.635 --> 42:51.336
Talk about how your dick
doesn't work either.

42:51.369 --> 42:54.539
- What?
My dick works great.

42:54.640 --> 42:56.007
- To see more of
"Vanderpump Rules,"

42:56.041 --> 42:57.475
go to bravotv.com.
