22:19.906 --> 22:21.372
What do you mean?

22:21.374 --> 22:24.542
Madam President,
need I remind you

22:24.544 --> 22:26.511
that, for the last
two years in a row,

22:26.513 --> 22:29.414
you have beat out
your best friend for office?

22:29.416 --> 22:31.649
On top
of her rejection from Brown?

22:31.651 --> 22:33.718
I mean, she must be...

22:33.720 --> 22:37.488
You know, people do crazy
things when they're jealous.

22:37.490 --> 22:39.557
She's not jealous.
She's my friend.

22:39.559 --> 22:44.495
Who had complete access to your
computer and your BuddyMe account.

22:44.497 --> 22:45.897
She loves me.

22:45.899 --> 22:48.866
Didn't stop her from
accusing you, now, did it?

22:48.868 --> 22:51.235
Mom!
Okay, okay.

22:51.237 --> 22:52.570
Forget I mentioned it.

22:52.572 --> 22:54.238
I'm gonna take
your computer in today

22:54.240 --> 22:55.907
and get one of those
fire thingies installed.

22:55.909 --> 22:57.542
Firewall?

22:57.544 --> 22:59.911
Fire... whatever.

22:59.913 --> 23:02.814
Let's precede
with our firewall plans.

23:02.816 --> 23:05.683
(CHUCKLES) Aren't you a little bit
late for school?

23:05.685 --> 23:07.018
(LAUGHS)

23:07.020 --> 23:09.520
Goodbye.

23:11.390 --> 23:14.659
The BuddyMe site administrators
told me to change my password.

23:14.661 --> 23:17.261
I just hope
it doesn't happen again.

23:17.263 --> 23:19.797
I'm sorry I freaked out.
It's just my stupid temper.

23:19.799 --> 23:22.266
I know you'd never really
write anything like that.

23:22.268 --> 23:24.802
I don't think you're a loser.
I think you're awesome.

23:24.804 --> 23:27.438
(LAUGHS)

23:27.440 --> 23:28.606
I know.

23:28.608 --> 23:30.441
Okay, I'll...
I'll see you soon.

23:30.443 --> 23:32.443
Okay, bye.

23:32.445 --> 23:34.512
(KIDS LAUGHING)

23:38.717 --> 23:40.451
What's going on?

23:40.453 --> 23:42.820
I don't know.
I'm so over high school.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.455
Hey, Cat. Nice work.

23:44.457 --> 23:46.457
Definitely put
that site to use.

23:46.459 --> 23:48.826
Ha! For sure. So much better
to be an informed consumer.

23:48.828 --> 23:51.029
What were those idiots
talking about?

23:51.031 --> 23:52.797
I have no idea.

23:54.466 --> 23:55.933
Hey, Jessica.
Hey, liar.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.436
What? You think just because
you're going to Brown

23:58.438 --> 24:00.571
and you're class president,
you can do whatever you want?

24:00.573 --> 24:02.306
You want to tell me
what you're talking about?

24:02.308 --> 24:04.809
You always did have such
a superiority complex.

24:04.811 --> 24:07.779
Thought you were smart enough
to keep it to yourself, though.

24:07.781 --> 24:09.480
Calm down, drama queen.

24:09.482 --> 24:10.815
I don't know why
you're defending her.

24:10.817 --> 24:11.816
You're on the list.

24:11.818 --> 24:13.151
What list?

24:15.387 --> 24:17.955
Yeah, apparently you scored
with some security guard

24:17.957 --> 24:19.490
at the mall where you work?

24:19.492 --> 24:20.591
What the hell?

24:20.593 --> 24:22.460
I don't even work at the mall.

24:22.462 --> 24:23.761
Yeah!
Way to go, Cat!

24:23.763 --> 24:25.863
You suck, Cat. I'm
taking my vote back.

24:25.865 --> 24:28.666
Did you think this would make you
popular, you stuck-up bitch?

24:28.668 --> 24:30.468
I had nothing to do with this!

24:36.809 --> 24:37.909
GIRL: Loser!

24:39.678 --> 24:40.678
This is crazy.

24:40.680 --> 24:41.979
Well, it's not me.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.915
Well, these are all
the pictures that we took.

24:43.917 --> 24:45.083
Well, I didn't create the page!

24:45.085 --> 24:46.617
It must be the hacker,

24:46.619 --> 24:48.486
the same one that posted
on my BuddyMe page.

24:48.488 --> 24:50.054
Where did they get
all these pictures?

24:50.056 --> 24:53.357
They were on the yearbook camera.
I don't know.

24:53.359 --> 24:55.359
Oh, no.

24:55.361 --> 24:56.394
What?

24:56.396 --> 24:58.062
They put Joan on here.

24:58.064 --> 24:59.530
(SIGHS)

24:59.532 --> 25:01.566
We should talk
to Mrs. Langran.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.404
Hey.

25:06.406 --> 25:08.940
I would never do
something like this.

25:08.942 --> 25:10.541
Someone is setting me up.

25:10.543 --> 25:13.578
I know you would never
do anything to hurt Joan.

25:13.580 --> 25:18.483
Besides, most of those girls on
that website really are sluts.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.520
That's what I heard.

25:22.522 --> 25:24.522
That's a weird thing to say.

25:24.524 --> 25:26.891
Girls, I need to see
you in my office now.

25:26.893 --> 25:28.559
Ms. Langran,
we have to talk.

25:28.561 --> 25:31.429
And you, don't you have a
class you should be in?

25:31.431 --> 25:33.498
Thank you. Come on.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.400
Mrs. Langran...

25:36.402 --> 25:38.169
Have a seat, girls.

25:38.171 --> 25:42.740
Do you want to tell me
what I am looking at?

25:42.742 --> 25:45.109
Somebody hacked into my
computer and posted this thing.

25:45.111 --> 25:46.577
It's not me, I promise.

25:46.579 --> 25:48.412
Correct me if I'm wrong,

25:48.414 --> 25:50.982
but both of you girls
took these pictures.

25:50.984 --> 25:52.483
Well, yeah,
we did, but...

25:52.485 --> 25:54.118
With the school's camera,

25:54.120 --> 25:57.088
and then you hacked into
the admin's email database

25:57.090 --> 25:59.557
and sent this
to every student in school?

25:59.559 --> 26:00.758
No. We took
those pictures,

26:00.760 --> 26:02.426
but we didn't do
the other stuff.

26:02.428 --> 26:04.595
Who took the camera home?

26:04.597 --> 26:06.597
I did.

26:06.599 --> 26:09.600
Did you loan it to anyone?

26:09.602 --> 26:10.735
No.

26:10.737 --> 26:12.436
Okay, where's the camera now?

26:12.438 --> 26:13.738
In my locker.

26:13.740 --> 26:16.073
I'm gonna need
the camera back immediately.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.074
Of course.

26:18.744 --> 26:21.612
And both of you
are off yearbook.

26:21.614 --> 26:22.947
What?

26:22.949 --> 26:25.116
That's B.S.
I didn't even do anything.

26:25.118 --> 26:27.018
Okay, Emily... I didn't have
anything to do with it!

26:27.020 --> 26:28.586
I didn't even have
the camera. Cat did.

26:28.588 --> 26:31.856
Did Emily have access
to the camera last night?

26:33.792 --> 26:36.027
No. I had it
the whole time.

26:36.029 --> 26:37.762
Okay, then. This is
your responsibility.

26:37.764 --> 26:40.231
I mean, this is very serious.

26:40.233 --> 26:42.600
The school could be
held liable for this.

26:42.602 --> 26:44.235
I didn't do this.

26:44.237 --> 26:45.970
I would never do this.

26:45.972 --> 26:48.172
Mrs. Langran,
please.

26:48.174 --> 26:51.175
Well, Emily, you are
off the hook for now.

26:51.177 --> 26:55.046
And, Cat, we'll look into this,

26:55.048 --> 26:57.048
but it's not
just gonna go away.

26:58.517 --> 27:02.220
All right, now back to
class, both of you.

27:10.929 --> 27:12.663
Wow, Em.
Way to have my back!

27:12.665 --> 27:14.498
What? What do you
want me to say?

27:14.500 --> 27:15.633
Everything she said was true.

27:15.635 --> 27:18.669
Um, how 'bout, "Cat would never do
something like that in a million years.

27:18.671 --> 27:19.837
Somebody else
posted the site."

27:19.839 --> 27:21.639
I defended you.
No, you didn't!

27:21.641 --> 27:24.008
You made sure you weren't
kicked off yearbook.

27:24.010 --> 27:25.509
Look, you took those pictures,

27:25.511 --> 27:27.578
and you had the camera
the whole time,

27:27.580 --> 27:30.248
so I don't know what happened, but
I'm not getting in trouble for it.

27:30.250 --> 27:31.716
(SCOFFS) Cool!

27:31.718 --> 27:34.018
I'm glad we've got
the facts straight.

All right, here we go.

27:42.028 --> 27:44.128
Best medicine in the world.

27:44.130 --> 27:48.266
Heh. I don't think ice cream is
gonna fix this problem, Mom.

27:48.268 --> 27:51.736
Honey, you remember that's the
same thing you used to say to me

27:51.738 --> 27:54.138
when you were in third
grade and Billy Peterson

27:54.140 --> 27:56.707
used to call you
Cat, Cat, the fatty fat.

27:56.709 --> 27:57.975
(LAUGHS)

27:57.977 --> 28:00.711
Well, then you fed
the fat girl ice cream.

28:00.713 --> 28:03.748
You were never fat.

28:03.750 --> 28:05.549
Plus, it worked, didn't it?

28:05.551 --> 28:08.319
You got over it, and now
Billy Peterson is fat

28:08.321 --> 28:11.756
and works at that awful taco stand.
Thank you, ice cream.

28:11.758 --> 28:12.890

so stressed out.

28:26.738 --> 28:29.040
Good, because next
we're gonna move on

28:29.042 --> 28:32.176
to my second prescription
for a tough day, shopping.

28:32.178 --> 28:33.611
It's very serious.

28:33.613 --> 28:37.048
Oh, that sounds
like serious business.

28:39.785 --> 28:44.021
It's actually really impressive how
many times you're on that site.

28:44.023 --> 28:46.624
You know what?
You better be careful.

28:46.626 --> 28:49.327

spread your disease.

28:49.329 --> 28:51.028
You're on it more than me.

28:51.030 --> 28:53.130
Oh, she burned you, Haylee!

28:53.132 --> 28:57.168
What is wrong with you?
You're the one who outed the slut.

28:57.170 --> 29:00.938
I didn't post that site.
Yeah, right.

29:00.940 --> 29:03.007

of yearbook class.

29:04.776 --> 29:07.111
Here. Have a couple.

29:07.113 --> 29:09.947

to keep your GPA up.

That's not all
she's keeping up.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.055
I know.

world of politics.

29:25.797 --> 29:28.132
What?

29:50.422 --> 29:53.057
All right, so I'll put
you down on the list

29:53.059 --> 29:55.159

in class and everything?

Please, Case?
It's kind of important.

I'll talk to you later.

a lot of people.

30:16.682 --> 30:18.783
I would never do anything

Is there anything you could say
that could change their minds?

Cat, I'd like to believe you.
I really would.

30:33.032 --> 30:34.698
Then I wouldn't feel
like such a fool.

30:34.700 --> 30:36.033
What is that supposed to mean?

30:36.035 --> 30:39.437
How is it that my name wound up
on your little Internet list?

30:39.439 --> 30:41.338
I don't know.
I told you, it's not my website.

I told that I was gay.

You were the only one,
the only person I trusted.

30:56.789 --> 30:58.889
I even knew exactly
when I told you,

31:00.760 --> 31:02.460
helping you with
your calc homework.

to be able to trust somebody,

all right,
to get it off my chest.

31:06.732 --> 31:08.132

31:08.134 --> 31:11.735
Casey, you can trust me.
I didn't tell anybody.

31:11.737 --> 31:12.903
Really?

I was called horrible names
in the hallway this morning.

to beat my ass.

31:23.381 --> 31:25.382
If you didn't make this list,

31:25.384 --> 31:27.318
then you told someone who did.

31:28.753 --> 31:31.422
Maybe somebody guessed just
by the way you look at Jason.

31:31.424 --> 31:33.924
Maybe you're not as on the D.L.
as you thought you were.

31:33.926 --> 31:35.793

what's more offensive,

31:35.795 --> 31:38.195
the idea that you
may have betrayed my trust

came out of your mouth.

home from school?

33:09.522 --> 33:11.522
Are you sick?

33:11.524 --> 33:14.024
I'm not sick. I just...

33:14.026 --> 33:16.493
(CRIES) I just...

33:16.495 --> 33:18.195
I can't be there right now.

33:18.197 --> 33:20.397
Everyone hates me!

33:20.399 --> 33:23.534
Oh, Kitty Cat, I don't.

33:23.536 --> 33:25.235
This isn't about you!

33:27.005 --> 33:28.539
Mom, I'm sorry. I just...

33:30.208 --> 33:32.309
I got kicked
off Student Council.

33:32.311 --> 33:34.545
What?

33:34.547 --> 33:36.180
They can't do that!

33:36.182 --> 33:38.949
Well, apparently they can,
because they already did it,

33:38.951 --> 33:41.552
and they announced the runner-up
is gonna take over my office.

33:41.554 --> 33:43.287
Emily?

33:44.356 --> 33:46.190
Yeah.

33:46.192 --> 33:49.326
Well, things are going pretty
well for her these days.

33:49.328 --> 33:50.961
Look.

33:55.066 --> 33:56.967
Yale?

33:56.969 --> 34:00.270
After you guys spent all
that time petitioning Brown?

34:01.906 --> 34:04.241
I didn't even know
she applied to Yale.

34:04.243 --> 34:07.177
Well, you two haven't had
secrets from each other before.

34:07.179 --> 34:08.312
I know.

34:08.313 --> 34:10.347
Oh, baby.

34:10.349 --> 34:11.681
Oh, come he...

34:11.684 --> 34:13.917
Oh, my sweetheart.

34:13.918 --> 34:15.085
(CRYING)

34:15.087 --> 34:17.221
At least you still
have Brown, okay?

34:17.223 --> 34:20.591
What's the point
if Emily's not going?

34:20.592 --> 34:23.092
Honey, you know, in life,

34:23.094 --> 34:26.496
things rarely go
according to your plans.

34:26.498 --> 34:31.268
I'm sorry. It's really all about
being flexible, you know.

34:31.270 --> 34:34.505
So maybe you put off Brown
and you stay here

34:34.507 --> 34:37.940
for your first two years
and go to a community college,

34:37.943 --> 34:41.078
and then you can live at home.
You're right.

34:41.080 --> 34:43.947
I should go to Brown/RISD
and get my degrees

34:43.949 --> 34:47.217
and start my own business,
because I don't need a partner.

34:47.219 --> 34:50.020
Uh, honey, you're not
really hearing me.

34:50.022 --> 34:51.455
No, you're right.

34:53.358 --> 34:57.594
Be flexible.
Yes, be flexible.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.363
Cat, where are you going?
To Emily's.

34:59.365 --> 35:03.233
I'm gonna tell her I'm gonna start my
own business and I don't need her.

35:03.235 --> 35:06.603
Just... Honey,
don't burn any bridges.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.605
I'm not.
I'm crossing them.

35:09.741 --> 35:11.041
Cat!

35:28.993 --> 35:30.227
Hi.

35:31.763 --> 35:34.064
Emily, it's Cat!

35:40.338 --> 35:42.706
Just a second, Cat.

35:42.708 --> 35:45.175
Tell her to go away.
She's standing there.

35:45.177 --> 35:47.211
I don't care!
I don't want to talk to her!

35:47.213 --> 35:48.512
Just go. Just go.

35:54.552 --> 35:56.553
Hi.

35:56.555 --> 35:57.755
So I guess congratulations

35:57.757 --> 35:59.623
are in order
for Student Council.

35:59.625 --> 36:02.025
You can't blame me for that.

36:02.027 --> 36:04.161
Who can I blame for
lying to me about Yale?

36:04.163 --> 36:06.363
I didn't lie!
I just didn't tell you

36:06.365 --> 36:08.298
every single little detail
of my life.

36:10.101 --> 36:13.070
We had a plan, Em.

36:13.072 --> 36:14.404
We were a team.

36:19.611 --> 36:22.379
You think I made that website,
don't you, and that BuddyMe post?

36:22.381 --> 36:24.248
You don't think
there's a hacker at all.

36:24.250 --> 36:26.216
You know what?

36:26.218 --> 36:27.518
I'm kind of over this,

36:27.520 --> 36:29.520
so you just go to Brown,
I'll go to Yale,

36:29.522 --> 36:31.688
and maybe I'll see you
at the reunion in 10 years.

36:33.758 --> 36:35.392
Or not.

36:35.394 --> 36:36.693
I have to go.

36:41.833 --> 36:45.135
(CRYING)

36:46.671 --> 36:48.405
It's like, I'm gonna
drive straight,

36:48.407 --> 36:50.073
and then I'm gonna turn left.

36:50.075 --> 36:51.375
(LAUGHING)

36:51.377 --> 36:54.478
Hey, I can help you
keep score if you want.

36:54.480 --> 36:56.146
Oh, what's the matter, Cat?

36:56.148 --> 36:57.147
Got your tongue?

36:57.149 --> 36:59.650
(LAUGHING)
Oh!

37:07.258 --> 37:08.725
Hey, Cat.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.427
You okay?

37:10.429 --> 37:12.095
Oh.

37:12.097 --> 37:13.096
Hi.

37:13.098 --> 37:14.231
Roger.

37:16.634 --> 37:18.836
What's going on?
You look upset.

37:23.174 --> 37:25.142
You got troubles, huh?

37:25.144 --> 37:26.643
Yeah.

37:26.645 --> 37:28.612
It's 'cause of that
scoreboard website?

37:28.614 --> 37:31.181
Look, I know it has
my name on it,

37:31.183 --> 37:33.183
but I didn't put up that site.

37:33.185 --> 37:35.786
Somebody went through a lot of
trouble to screw up my life.

37:35.788 --> 37:38.522
And it's not just the website.
It's the BuddyMe page.

37:38.524 --> 37:40.858
Someone posted things
that I didn't post.

37:40.860 --> 37:44.194
Worst part of it all is
nobody seems to believe me.

37:45.330 --> 37:47.331
I believe you.

37:47.333 --> 37:51.201
Look, nothing is safe
on the Internet.

37:51.203 --> 37:53.770
No matter how secure
you think you are,

37:53.772 --> 37:57.641
there are people out there
that can hack into anything.

37:57.643 --> 37:59.776
Look, I know this guy.

37:59.778 --> 38:02.279
He might be able to help you.

38:02.281 --> 38:04.715
He's a full-on
computer genius.

38:04.717 --> 38:07.351
He... I had a problem. He helped
me out a few months ago.

38:07.353 --> 38:09.353
What kind of problem?

38:09.355 --> 38:12.289
Well, someone was
catfishing this girl

38:12.291 --> 38:14.191
using a picture of me
from track.

38:14.193 --> 38:16.727
So do you think
he would help me?

38:16.729 --> 38:18.862
Well, of course he would, yeah.

38:18.864 --> 38:20.864
I mean,
he's a good friend of mine.

38:20.866 --> 38:22.933
That would be so great.

38:22.935 --> 38:25.736
Why don't you meet me
over at his place

38:25.738 --> 38:28.739
after school,
say, 5:00?

38:28.741 --> 38:30.507
Sure.

38:30.509 --> 38:31.642
Okay.

38:31.644 --> 38:33.577
Here. I'll give you
his address.

38:33.579 --> 38:36.580
Thank you so much
for your help.

38:36.582 --> 38:38.181
I so appreciate it.

38:38.183 --> 38:39.583
Yeah, it's okay.

38:39.585 --> 38:42.519
I gotta run, but I'll...
I'll see you later?

38:42.521 --> 38:43.520
Yeah.
Okay.

38:43.522 --> 38:44.821
Bye.
Bye.

39:08.813 --> 39:10.647
Cat! You made it.

39:10.649 --> 39:12.649
Hey.
Come on in.

39:12.651 --> 39:14.618
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

39:16.654 --> 39:19.489
Cat, this is
my good buddy, Cool D.

39:20.558 --> 39:22.559
Wassup?
Cool,

39:22.561 --> 39:25.662
this is the girl I was
talking to you about, Cat?

39:25.664 --> 39:26.830
Hi.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.500
Go ahead.
Sit down.

39:31.736 --> 39:34.738
He not only fixed
my catfishing problem.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.907
We actually found the
guy who was doing it.

39:36.909 --> 39:38.575
Really?

39:38.577 --> 39:39.876
Hell, yeah.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.611
Just gotta know
what you're looking for.

39:42.747 --> 39:44.751
Cold one?

39:47.753 --> 39:49.319
So you think you can help?

39:49.321 --> 39:52.489
Well, that is always
a possibility, right?

39:55.293 --> 39:57.761
Hey, yo, why don't you
give us some privacy

39:57.763 --> 39:59.463
so I can converse
freely with my client?

40:02.767 --> 40:04.668
Okay, sure.

40:12.677 --> 40:17.481
So? Holler at me.

40:17.483 --> 40:21.318
Somebody posted a website using
information from my computer.

40:21.320 --> 40:23.286
Yeah.

40:23.288 --> 40:24.521
You mean this one?

40:27.959 --> 40:29.526
Yeah.

40:31.629 --> 40:34.631
Do you think you can find out
who hacked into my stuff?

40:34.633 --> 40:36.466
If you remember
when it happened.

40:36.468 --> 40:38.902
I can look into the logs
on your router,

40:38.904 --> 40:42.439
see if there's any traffic going
into your computer, you know.

40:42.441 --> 40:43.974
Someone maybe copied your data.

40:43.976 --> 40:47.010
That is, if they hacked in using
one of them Trojans online.

40:47.012 --> 40:49.813
(LAUGHS)

40:49.815 --> 40:52.916
Has anybody had access to your
computer without you knowing?

40:52.918 --> 40:55.485
No. I'm the only one.

40:55.487 --> 40:57.954
All right.
Did you bring it with you?

40:57.956 --> 40:59.556
Yeah, it's right here.

41:00.658 --> 41:02.959
That's what's up.

41:06.631 --> 41:08.632
So, when can you start?

41:08.634 --> 41:11.101
Well, there's still
the matter of my fee.

41:11.103 --> 41:14.771
Right.
How much do you charge?

41:14.773 --> 41:16.673
Something like this

41:16.675 --> 41:18.675
is gonna run you
the tune of, like,

41:18.677 --> 41:19.812
10 Gs.

41:21.814 --> 41:23.814
Wow, that's a lot of money.

41:23.816 --> 41:26.616
I do quality work.

41:26.618 --> 41:29.352
Uh, I'll see...

41:29.354 --> 41:30.687
(LAUGHS)

41:30.689 --> 41:32.689
I'm just messing
with you, girl.

41:32.691 --> 41:35.358
Damn.
What?

41:35.360 --> 41:36.927
I don't expect you to come up

41:36.929 --> 41:38.695
with that type of money.
You crazy?

41:38.697 --> 41:41.798
Oh, okay.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.433
Yeah, for sure,

41:43.435 --> 41:45.435
'cause it's not always
about the monies.

41:45.437 --> 41:46.736
You know what I'm saying?

41:47.939 --> 41:49.539
I don't,

41:49.541 --> 41:52.642
but I can figure out some
way to pay you later.

41:56.147 --> 41:57.747
Nah, you can pay me right now.

41:58.983 --> 42:00.450
Come on, Cat.
You know you like to party.

42:00.452 --> 42:01.451
Okay! Get off me!

42:07.125 --> 42:09.726
Ah, come on, Cat.
You're not leaving

42:09.728 --> 42:12.395
before the money shot, are you?

42:12.397 --> 42:14.131
That's right!
You better run, slut!

42:21.839 --> 42:23.807
(GASPING)

42:25.042 --> 42:26.743
Hello.
Hey, Mom.

42:26.745 --> 42:28.044
Could you come pick me up?

42:28.046 --> 42:30.113
I missed the bus,
and it's getting late.

42:30.115 --> 42:32.182
How'd it go?
Is everything okay?

42:32.184 --> 42:33.850
Yeah, everything's fine.

42:33.852 --> 42:36.419
Okay, I'll be there soon.

42:36.421 --> 42:37.787
Okay.

42:54.438 --> 42:56.439
Cat, you are typically
a really good student,

42:56.441 --> 43:00.010
but I have to say I'm very concerned
with what is going on here.

43:00.012 --> 43:02.879
I've had four girls
come to talk to me

43:02.881 --> 43:05.015
about this scoreboard site
just this morning.

43:05.017 --> 43:09.786
They say boys are writing
stories about them,

43:09.788 --> 43:12.122
lying in the comments section.

43:12.124 --> 43:13.857
They were very upset.

43:14.926 --> 43:16.593
I'm upset, too.

43:16.595 --> 43:18.728
I didn't post it.
I think it's gross.

43:18.730 --> 43:22.132
It doesn't seem like
something you would do.

43:22.134 --> 43:24.301
It's not me, I swear.

43:26.470 --> 43:27.737
I didn't post it.

43:27.739 --> 43:30.907
Somebody hacked
into my accounts.

43:30.909 --> 43:33.944
Well, can you think of
who would want to do that?

43:33.946 --> 43:36.880
I don't know.
Somebody jealous,

43:36.882 --> 43:39.249
somebody trying
to ruin my life.

43:40.518 --> 43:41.952
Like who?

43:43.254 --> 43:46.056
I don't know.

43:46.058 --> 43:47.891
Maybe Haylee?

43:49.760 --> 43:52.829
Cyberbullying isn't
covered under state laws.

43:52.831 --> 43:56.132
People are working on it,
but it's hard to define.

43:56.134 --> 43:59.135
However, when we find out
who's behind this,

43:59.137 --> 44:00.937
they will be expelled.

44:00.939 --> 44:02.839
You believe me?

44:03.841 --> 44:05.709
I don't know what to believe,

44:05.711 --> 44:08.011
but this is not the Cat I know.

44:08.013 --> 44:09.112
So don't worry.

44:09.114 --> 44:11.581
We will get
to the bottom of this.

44:12.817 --> 44:14.084
Thanks a lot, Cat.

44:14.086 --> 44:15.085
(COUGHS)
Bitch.

44:15.087 --> 44:16.519
What was that?

44:16.521 --> 44:18.855
Okay, you and you,
in my office now.

44:18.857 --> 44:21.191
I want to talk about these
stories that you wrote.

44:21.193 --> 44:23.126
Now!

(SIGHS)

44:32.804 --> 44:34.204
Who did that?

44:34.206 --> 44:35.939
Who did that, Joan?

44:35.941 --> 44:38.041
What are you all
laughing at, huh?

44:38.043 --> 44:39.175
You think it's funny?

44:39.177 --> 44:41.745
Huh?! You think
this is funny!

44:41.747 --> 44:43.146
Get out of here!

44:43.148 --> 44:44.614
Oh, Joan.

44:44.616 --> 44:46.816
Hey, did you guys
see anything? Who did this?

44:48.719 --> 44:50.186
It's not true.

44:50.188 --> 44:51.288
I know it's not.

44:51.290 --> 44:53.556
You said, but it's not true.

44:53.558 --> 44:56.559
I would never say
anything bad about you.

45:13.577 --> 45:14.577
What's going on?

45:14.579 --> 45:15.879
Get out of the way.

45:15.881 --> 45:18.615
Are you angry at me?

45:18.617 --> 45:19.983
I defended you.

45:19.985 --> 45:20.984
I just...

45:22.153 --> 45:24.321
I just thought there was no way

45:24.323 --> 45:26.856
you would ever
post those things.

45:26.858 --> 45:29.225
I bet you were just laughing
at what an idiot I was, huh?

45:29.227 --> 45:31.094
I don't know what
you're talking about!

45:31.096 --> 45:33.730
If you want to hurt me,
then whatever.

45:33.732 --> 45:37.600
But to tell Joan
after I trusted you?

45:37.602 --> 45:39.869
I didn't tell Joan anything.

45:39.871 --> 45:41.071
We're done!

45:42.873 --> 45:44.007

No.

46:26.650 --> 46:31.154
Aw, poor baby.

46:31.156 --> 46:33.723
You should have kept my
name out of your mouth.

46:33.725 --> 46:36.292
You told Mrs. Langran
that I wrote that list?

46:36.294 --> 46:38.661
Now she wants to get me
kicked out of school.

46:38.663 --> 46:40.730
Why are you doing this to me?

46:40.732 --> 46:43.299
I didn't do anything
to you, yet.

46:43.301 --> 46:46.269
When my mom finds out,
she's gonna beat my ass,

46:46.271 --> 46:47.737
so I'm gonna
beat your ass first!

46:47.739 --> 46:49.205
Get her!

46:49.207 --> 46:51.007
Yeah!
Come on!

46:51.009 --> 46:53.276
That'll teach her.

46:53.278 --> 46:55.145
Yeah!

46:57.883 --> 47:00.283
Get off her! Now!

47:00.285 --> 47:02.352

47:14.966 --> 47:17.834
It was Haylee.
Yes, I know.

47:17.836 --> 47:19.135
She's going to be
dealt with for fighting.

47:19.137 --> 47:22.338
She did the other stuff, too,
the list and the hacking.

47:22.340 --> 47:25.875
Cat, I looked into it.

47:25.877 --> 47:28.011
I don't think she did it.

47:28.013 --> 47:30.046
Nobody believes me.

47:30.048 --> 47:32.182
I want to believe you,
I really do,

47:32.184 --> 47:35.318
but your story,
it's just not lining up.

Well, jeez, Cat,
I'm mad at you,

48:00.278 --> 48:01.978
but I don't hate you.

48:03.914 --> 48:05.248
Thanks.

48:07.151 --> 48:08.751
Okay.

48:08.753 --> 48:10.420
It's gonna be okay.

48:17.428 --> 48:19.496
Oh, my God. Baby.

48:19.498 --> 48:22.332
Oh, baby.
Hi, Mom.

48:22.334 --> 48:24.067
Oh, my God.
Oh, my baby.

48:24.069 --> 48:26.536
I came as soon as the
principal called me.

48:26.538 --> 48:28.538
Here, come in. Here.
Just lay down here.

48:28.540 --> 48:30.373
Oh, careful, honey.
Careful. Lie down.

48:30.375 --> 48:33.009
Maybe... Maybe I could
come by later?

48:34.512 --> 48:36.813
If you feel like you have to,

48:36.815 --> 48:38.548
but maybe tomorrow
would be better.

48:38.550 --> 48:41.918
I'm starting to think maybe she
didn't do all those things.

48:41.920 --> 48:44.387
I'm her mother. I know.

48:46.957 --> 48:49.325
We'll get you to the doctor.

49:03.140 --> 49:05.975
Do you have trouble
sleeping at night?

49:05.977 --> 49:07.310
Lately, yeah.

49:07.312 --> 49:09.979
Yeah, she has a
history of anxiety.

49:09.981 --> 49:11.281
Oh. That's...

49:11.283 --> 49:13.550
No, that's not in her file.

49:13.552 --> 49:15.818
Well, it wasn't diagnosed,

49:15.820 --> 49:18.154
but she always had panic
attacks when she was a kid.

49:18.156 --> 49:20.356
Does anxiety
run in your family?

49:22.026 --> 49:23.860
No.

49:23.862 --> 49:24.861
Depression or...

49:24.863 --> 49:26.095
No.

49:26.097 --> 49:27.897
Well, there was some trouble

49:27.899 --> 49:32.869
when I had a pregnancy,
um, a miscarriage.

49:33.471 --> 49:36.339
Um, but they said that
that was just hormonal.

49:39.143 --> 49:42.845
Okay, I'm gonna prescribe something
for you, Cat, for the pain,

49:42.847 --> 49:45.348
uh, just enough
for the next few days.

49:45.350 --> 49:50.987
And I can prescribe
a mild antidepressant.

49:52.189 --> 49:55.024
Do you think that's necessary?

49:55.026 --> 49:58.361
Well, if anxiety is negatively
affecting her life, I...

49:58.363 --> 50:00.196
I don't have anxiety.

50:00.198 --> 50:01.931
Cat, please.

50:01.933 --> 50:06.936
Have you had heart palpitations
or trouble breathing?

had panic attacks?

Yes.

Um...

50:23.054 --> 50:24.253
yes.

50:26.290 --> 50:28.558
Do you want to try
the antidepressants?

50:29.893 --> 50:31.628
Okay.

50:31.630 --> 50:32.996
Okay.

50:34.064 --> 50:35.632
Okay.

50:36.667 --> 50:39.335
We'll get you started on a
low dose of Alprazolam.

50:39.337 --> 50:40.903
Is it safe?

50:40.905 --> 50:42.905
It'll take her body
a little while

50:42.907 --> 50:44.507
to get adjusted
to the medication,

50:44.509 --> 50:46.242
but after that, she'll be fine.

50:46.244 --> 50:47.310
Okay.
Okay.

to talk to you!

on school, and...

I don't know... finish
your AP English exam.

a few months to go.

at all this stuff with Cat.

58:18.529 --> 58:19.695
Hey!
Hey, that's my phone!

58:19.697 --> 58:20.863
Come on.

58:20.865 --> 58:22.431
Hey, if Daniel's done with you,

58:22.433 --> 58:23.766
I don't mind sloppy seconds.

58:23.768 --> 58:26.001
(LAUGHS)
I'm just saying.

58:26.003 --> 58:27.903
Hey, were... No, seriously,
were those silk?

58:27.905 --> 58:29.371
(LAUGHTER)

58:29.373 --> 58:31.507
Hey, I was just... Oh,
I was just kidding.

58:31.509 --> 58:33.709
All right, all right!
Knock it off right now!

58:33.711 --> 58:35.444
Whoo, Cat!

58:35.446 --> 58:36.779
All right, all right,
knock it...

58:39.950 --> 58:42.084
(CELLPHONE RINGTONE)

58:49.426 --> 58:51.193
Oh, my God.

59:16.119 --> 59:17.586
You!

59:17.588 --> 59:19.121
You sent those pictures of me!

59:19.123 --> 59:21.924
That's right.
Those were private!

59:21.926 --> 59:23.759
So was what I said
to you about Joan.

59:23.761 --> 59:26.428
So was the stuff you sent
to Yale about Emily, Cat!

59:26.430 --> 59:28.564
What? You know what?
I don't even care anymore!

59:28.566 --> 59:30.166
You can't just mess around
with peoples' lives

59:30.168 --> 59:32.168
and expect to get away with it!

59:32.170 --> 59:34.970
I don't get it. So you
sent those pictures of me

59:34.972 --> 59:37.173
because of what you think
I did to your sister?

59:37.175 --> 59:39.175
Okay, but that other stuff?

59:39.177 --> 59:42.878
The scoreboard?
Hacking into my phone?

59:42.880 --> 59:46.015
That stupid
HoneyDaddy site? Why?

59:46.017 --> 59:48.083
What did I ever do to you?

59:48.085 --> 59:49.585
I sent the pictures, yeah,

59:49.587 --> 59:51.453
but... but don't
you dare try

59:51.455 --> 59:54.089
and turn all that other stuff
you did around on me!

59:54.091 --> 59:56.158
Just admit it!
You're the hacker!

59:56.160 --> 59:57.893
Oh. Oh, you'd like

59:57.895 --> 59:59.895
people to think that,
wouldn't you? Wouldn't you?

59:59.897 --> 01:00:02.064
EMILY: You bitch!

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:12.141
(GROANS)

01:00:12.143 --> 01:00:13.809
You know what?
I am so sick of this!

01:00:13.811 --> 01:00:15.477
You know why you're so jealous?

01:00:15.479 --> 01:00:19.081
Because I earned being class president.
I earned Brown!

01:00:19.083 --> 01:00:21.483
I didn't have to beg
for those things like you.

01:00:21.485 --> 01:00:22.618
Face it, Emily.

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:25.487
You're good, but I'm better,
and you can't deal with it.

01:00:25.489 --> 01:00:28.057
I want to smash your face in.

01:00:28.059 --> 01:00:29.558
Oh, so do it.

01:00:35.498 --> 01:00:37.566
What in the world?

01:00:37.568 --> 01:00:39.201
Hey!

01:00:39.203 --> 01:00:40.669
Don't!

01:00:40.671 --> 01:00:42.905
Cat! Emily!

01:00:42.907 --> 01:00:44.006
Stop this right now!

01:00:44.008 --> 01:00:45.107
Cat!
Emily! Emily!

01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:46.108
Stop this right now!

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:47.509
Watch me!
Emily, stop.

01:00:47.511 --> 01:00:48.911
Right now.

01:00:51.081 --> 01:00:52.948
Don't touch my daughter!
Back off!

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:54.717
Keep your hands off her!
That's assault!

01:00:54.719 --> 01:00:56.518
She assaulted
my daughter first!

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.686
Hey, Cat started it.

01:00:57.688 --> 01:00:59.822
You be quiet!
Whoa! Whoa!

01:00:59.824 --> 01:01:01.991
Put that phone away,
or I'll take it from you!

01:01:01.993 --> 01:01:03.859
DANIEL: Get back!
Stay away from me!

01:01:03.861 --> 01:01:04.960
I'm calling the police.

01:01:04.962 --> 01:01:06.161
Good.

01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:07.529
EMILY: No.

01:01:07.531 --> 01:01:09.865
No, it was me. I...

01:01:09.867 --> 01:01:11.233
I started it.

01:01:14.704 --> 01:01:17.006
What are you gonna do about it?

01:01:17.008 --> 01:01:18.607
I'm already suspended,

01:01:18.609 --> 01:01:21.210
so you guys don't have
to deal with me anymore.

01:01:24.547 --> 01:01:27.549
That's the second fight Cat's had
on school property this week.

01:01:27.551 --> 01:01:28.884
So why isn't she suspended?

01:01:28.886 --> 01:01:30.619
Mr. Hargroves, I'll handle this.

01:01:30.621 --> 01:01:32.154
'Cause you're doing a real
bang-up job up till now!

01:01:32.156 --> 01:01:33.322
Give me that phone.

01:01:33.324 --> 01:01:35.024
Hey, no way. No way!
This is for Emily

01:01:35.026 --> 01:01:37.760
if she decides to
change her mind.

01:01:37.762 --> 01:01:39.328
Take that phone from him.

01:01:39.330 --> 01:01:40.996
You gonna let him
post that online

01:01:40.998 --> 01:01:44.033
just like he did all those
dirty pictures of...

01:01:44.035 --> 01:01:45.334
Daniel, go home.

01:01:45.336 --> 01:01:48.003
Take his phone!
Mrs. Hardy, please!

01:01:48.005 --> 01:01:49.705
My daughter is being bullied,

01:01:49.707 --> 01:01:52.341
and I don't see the school
doing a thing about it.

01:01:52.343 --> 01:01:54.310
Okay, we'll schedule a
meeting as soon as possible.

01:01:56.012 --> 01:01:58.714
You're damn right we will.
Come on, baby.

01:02:14.331 --> 01:02:16.932
Can't find my phone.
It's not in your bag?

01:02:16.934 --> 01:02:19.168
No. I think I dropped it
during the fight.

01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:22.304
We'll call the office and
see if anyone turned it in.

01:02:22.306 --> 01:02:24.106
I think someone picked it up.

01:02:24.108 --> 01:02:27.209
That's all I need, more
people looking at my stuff.

01:02:29.346 --> 01:02:33.282
Honey, where did those...

01:02:33.284 --> 01:02:35.951
underwear pictures come from?

01:02:40.023 --> 01:02:41.924
I took them.

01:02:41.926 --> 01:02:43.926
Why?

01:02:43.928 --> 01:02:46.295
I thought Danny was special.

01:02:46.297 --> 01:02:47.896
I thought he'd keep them
to himself.

01:02:47.898 --> 01:02:49.231
(SIGHS)

01:02:49.233 --> 01:02:51.767
What you kids just
don't understand

01:02:51.769 --> 01:02:54.970
is that these things
that you put up online

01:02:54.972 --> 01:02:58.974
and these pictures that you
post or send or whatever you do

01:02:58.976 --> 01:03:01.343
is they... they
stick around forever.

01:03:01.345 --> 01:03:04.947
They have a life. They...
Even if you erase them,

01:03:04.949 --> 01:03:07.983
people, creepy people, can pass
them on and on, and they...

01:03:07.985 --> 01:03:10.185
Okay, I don't need
a lecture right now!

01:03:12.655 --> 01:03:14.723
I learned my lesson. I'll
never trust anyone again!

01:03:14.725 --> 01:03:16.358
Oh.

01:03:22.265 --> 01:03:24.333
Mom.
Yeah?

01:03:25.869 --> 01:03:29.104
I didn't know you
had a miscarriage.

01:03:29.106 --> 01:03:31.373
That was a long time ago, baby.

01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:35.377
Do you want to talk about it?

01:03:40.016 --> 01:03:42.084
Maybe I won't go to Brown.

01:03:43.453 --> 01:03:48.023
Maybe I'll just stay at home like
you said, go to community college.

01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:52.428
It's up to you, sweetheart.

01:03:58.001 --> 01:03:59.468
Just for a while.

01:04:05.909 --> 01:04:07.042
She can't sleep.

01:04:07.044 --> 01:04:08.477
She's been on antidepressants.

01:04:08.479 --> 01:04:11.213
I mean, this has
just gone on too far.

01:04:11.215 --> 01:04:13.449
Daniel has admitted
to sending those photos,

01:04:13.451 --> 01:04:14.983
and we have
suspended him accordingly.

01:04:14.985 --> 01:04:16.718
Well, that's not good enough!

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.720
Well, we have no proof
that he's done anything else.

01:04:18.722 --> 01:04:22.991
My daughter is 17 years old!
She is a minor!

01:04:22.993 --> 01:04:26.495
What he's done is basically
distributed child pornography.

01:04:26.497 --> 01:04:30.065
I want him expelled permanently,

01:04:30.067 --> 01:04:32.267
and I'm gonna call
the authorities.

01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:33.735
No, Mom, don't.

01:04:33.737 --> 01:04:35.737
I just want to forget
this ever happened.

01:04:35.739 --> 01:04:38.407
Honey, we cannot let him
victimize you like that.

01:04:38.409 --> 01:04:39.908
That fight,

01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:42.144
he's probably posting
that online right now.

01:04:46.749 --> 01:04:49.384

of them in, please. Thank you.

We have another problem.

01:04:54.058 --> 01:04:55.591
What now?

01:04:59.762 --> 01:05:02.431
Mr. Perryman, Ms. Langran,
you know Cat's mother...

01:05:02.433 --> 01:05:04.199
Hello, Cat.
Mrs. Hardy.

01:05:04.201 --> 01:05:06.335
Hey.
Mr. Perryman, go ahead.

01:05:06.337 --> 01:05:10.405
Mrs. Langran has a program that we run
all of the students' papers through.

01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:14.176
It checks the written story
to Internet archives.

01:05:14.178 --> 01:05:17.446
It's the first thing I do when a
student turns in an assignment.

01:05:17.448 --> 01:05:19.515
I hate to accuse you, Cat.

01:05:19.517 --> 01:05:21.450
You're an excellent student.

01:05:21.452 --> 01:05:23.118
Your AP final,

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:26.255
the program found
a match for plagiarism.

01:05:26.257 --> 01:05:28.557
What?
This isn't my paper.

01:05:28.559 --> 01:05:33.095
That's what you turned in.
I didn't write this.

01:05:33.097 --> 01:05:36.131
That is the paper
you handed to me yesterday.

01:05:44.073 --> 01:05:46.208
I give up.

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:49.411
This is serious, young lady.

01:05:49.413 --> 01:05:51.513
We take charges of plagiarism
very seriously.

01:05:51.515 --> 01:05:53.949
This, you take seriously?

01:05:53.951 --> 01:05:58.186
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to fail you, Cat,

01:05:58.188 --> 01:06:01.223
and you won't be able to
continue in the AP classes.

01:06:01.225 --> 01:06:03.091
But the school year's
almost over.

01:06:03.093 --> 01:06:05.060
Those classes will be
removed from your record,

01:06:05.062 --> 01:06:09.331
and you probably will not
graduate this spring.

01:06:09.333 --> 01:06:10.899
This is insanity.

01:06:10.901 --> 01:06:12.334
She's going to Brown!

01:06:12.336 --> 01:06:15.103
Cat, this is
so out of character for you.

01:06:15.105 --> 01:06:16.905
You don't seem okay.

01:06:16.907 --> 01:06:18.473
She's not okay.
She is being punished

01:06:18.475 --> 01:06:20.242
for absolutely no reason.
Come on, Cat.

01:06:20.244 --> 01:06:22.511
Is anything going on
that I should know about?

01:06:22.513 --> 01:06:24.980
Maybe you should look
into how those essays

01:06:24.982 --> 01:06:27.316
ended up on your computer
program, Ms. Langran.

01:06:27.318 --> 01:06:28.550
What are you insinuating?

01:06:30.253 --> 01:06:31.553
I don't know
what your problem is,

01:06:31.555 --> 01:06:33.388
but you've been doing
everything you can

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:35.223
to make sure
that my daughter fails.

01:06:35.225 --> 01:06:38.126
Well, I am sorry
you feel that way.

01:06:38.128 --> 01:06:40.262
We are suing you. We are
suing this district.

01:06:40.264 --> 01:06:42.331
We are suing those bullies!

01:06:42.333 --> 01:06:45.100
Mrs. Hardy, considering
everything that's happened,

01:06:45.102 --> 01:06:47.369
you might decide
that homeschooling

01:06:47.371 --> 01:06:49.371
is more appropriate
for your daughter.

01:06:49.373 --> 01:06:52.941
(SCOFFS) It'd be a hell of a
lot better than this zoo.

01:06:52.943 --> 01:06:56.078
And you can wipe that phony
look of concern off your face!

01:07:01.417 --> 01:07:05.087
It's okay, sweetie. I'm gonna
fight this thing all the way.

01:07:05.089 --> 01:07:09.224
Don't you get it?
I don't want to fight anymore.

01:07:09.226 --> 01:07:12.160
They actually suggested
you homeschool.

01:07:12.162 --> 01:07:13.695
Sounds good to me.

01:07:27.243 --> 01:07:29.011
You know what?
I am so sick of this!

01:07:29.013 --> 01:07:30.512
I earned being president!

01:07:30.514 --> 01:07:32.547
I didn't have to beg
for those things like you did.

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:35.050
You're good, but I'm better,
and you can't deal with it.

01:07:35.052 --> 01:07:36.718
I want to smash your face in.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.420
So do it.

01:07:38.422 --> 01:07:39.388
Oh!

01:07:41.157 --> 01:07:43.125
Oh, you okay, baby?

01:07:43.127 --> 01:07:45.427
You have a nightmare?

01:07:45.429 --> 01:07:47.696
Bad dream?

01:07:47.698 --> 01:07:50.599
Oh, I just keep thinking
about that fight with Emily

01:07:50.601 --> 01:07:52.601
and how Daniel
has it on his phone

01:07:52.603 --> 01:07:54.302
and how I can't find my phone

01:07:54.304 --> 01:07:56.338
and how I'm just gonna
go online any minute

01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:59.408
and see this title like "Real Cat
Fight," and I'm just so sick of it.

01:07:59.410 --> 01:08:01.576
Calm down, baby.
Calm down.

01:08:01.578 --> 01:08:03.311
Here. Take one of these.

01:08:03.313 --> 01:08:04.646
It's not time yet.

01:08:04.648 --> 01:08:06.615
It'll relax you.

Come on.

01:08:08.018 --> 01:08:09.551
It'll make you feel better.

01:08:17.225 --> 01:08:19.261
I have to talk to Daniel.

01:08:20.363 --> 01:08:22.064
What? No.

01:08:22.066 --> 01:08:23.465
No good can come from that.

Just stay away
from those people.

01:08:28.504 --> 01:08:32.274
Come on. Let's get you
back to sleep.

01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:38.680
Why did you send everyone
those pictures of Cat?

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.787
What do you care?

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:49.057
I thought you hated her guts.

01:08:49.059 --> 01:08:51.225
I do.

01:08:51.228 --> 01:08:53.060
We've been friends
a really long time, okay?

01:08:53.063 --> 01:08:55.697
It's hard to just stop
caring about her.

01:08:58.401 --> 01:09:01.403
Do you still have
that video of us fighting?

01:09:01.404 --> 01:09:03.071
Maybe.

01:09:03.073 --> 01:09:04.339
Well, can you erase it?

01:09:04.341 --> 01:09:05.707
Because the last thing I need

01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:07.776
is for more embarrassing
crap to get out there.

01:09:07.778 --> 01:09:10.779
Maybe I'll erase it.
Maybe I won't.

01:09:10.781 --> 01:09:12.214
I don't know yet.

01:09:15.384 --> 01:09:17.085
What?

01:09:17.087 --> 01:09:18.787
Are you the one
doing all this stuff?

01:09:18.788 --> 01:09:22.357
W-Wait. Are you serious?

01:09:24.426 --> 01:09:26.728
You know what?
I-I've figured you out.

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:28.796
You're totally
obsessed with Cat.

01:09:28.799 --> 01:09:30.265
That's what it is.

01:09:30.267 --> 01:09:32.134
That's what it's got to be.

01:09:32.136 --> 01:09:33.234
What?
Yeah.

01:09:33.237 --> 01:09:37.139
Taking all the same classes.
Making the same plans.

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:39.441
You guys even go to
the restroom together.

01:09:39.443 --> 01:09:40.776
Yeah. We're girls.

01:09:40.778 --> 01:09:42.511
That's, like, what we do!

01:09:42.513 --> 01:09:44.746
I'm not the one
who took her vulnerable,

01:09:44.747 --> 01:09:46.448
trusting first attempts
at sexuality

01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:48.817
and just tossed them all out
there for the world to see!

01:09:48.819 --> 01:09:50.886
(LAUGHS)
You know, whatever.

01:09:50.888 --> 01:09:52.319
Are we done here?

01:09:52.322 --> 01:09:54.456
You and I, yeah, we're done.

01:09:54.458 --> 01:09:57.325
You know what? I think we're
all pretty much done.

01:09:57.327 --> 01:09:58.326
Yeah, yeah.

01:09:58.328 --> 01:10:00.529
Well, peace, out!

01:10:03.332 --> 01:10:05.467
(GIRLS CHATTING)

01:10:05.469 --> 01:10:07.602
I know. Shut up.

01:10:10.573 --> 01:10:12.707
(SIGHS)
This sucks.

01:10:29.826 --> 01:10:32.561
(SIGHS)

01:10:38.835 --> 01:10:40.602
Dad!

01:10:40.604 --> 01:10:43.305
Dad, I got into Brown!
They just...

01:10:43.307 --> 01:10:45.173
They said they were
moved by my appeal,

01:10:45.175 --> 01:10:46.641
and they're... they're
letting me in!

01:10:46.643 --> 01:10:48.009
Dad!

01:11:02.825 --> 01:11:04.926
What time is it?
(GASPS)

01:11:04.928 --> 01:11:07.362
(LAUGHS)

01:11:07.364 --> 01:11:09.397
You scared the life out of me.

01:11:09.399 --> 01:11:12.267
I wish you wouldn't
sneak up on me like that.

01:11:14.837 --> 01:11:17.272
How long was I asleep?

01:11:17.274 --> 01:11:18.540
A while.

01:11:18.542 --> 01:11:19.975
You probably needed it.

01:11:19.977 --> 01:11:22.978
Your body needs to recover
from all that stress.

01:11:24.413 --> 01:11:26.548
Ehh. I don't like
this medication.

01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:27.916
It makes me sleepy.

01:11:27.918 --> 01:11:30.385
Well, the doctor said

01:11:30.387 --> 01:11:33.889
that you'd need time
to adjust to it, so...

01:11:36.859 --> 01:11:40.862
Is the sun coming up
or going down?

01:11:40.864 --> 01:11:43.932
It's evening, honey.
It's almost time for dinner.

01:11:43.934 --> 01:11:45.967
Are you hungry?

01:11:45.969 --> 01:11:47.369
No.

01:11:50.539 --> 01:11:53.642
Oh, Kitty Cat, why don't
you look at that after?

01:11:53.644 --> 01:11:55.277
It's from Brown.

01:11:55.279 --> 01:11:57.812
Well, maybe after you've
woken up or eaten something.

01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:00.448
Let's see.

01:12:02.718 --> 01:12:05.954

01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:15.964
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

01:12:15.966 --> 01:12:18.833
I know how hard you've worked.

01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:22.337
You could still apply
to community college

01:12:22.339 --> 01:12:26.274
and live here and be
near your friends.

01:12:26.276 --> 01:12:27.342
(SCOFFS)

01:12:27.344 --> 01:12:28.910
I don't have any friends.

01:12:30.446 --> 01:12:32.547
I could still look after you.

01:12:33.749 --> 01:12:35.750
What are we having for dinner?

01:12:35.752 --> 01:12:38.720
Pot roast and spinach salad.

01:12:38.722 --> 01:12:39.921
(SIGHS)

01:12:39.923 --> 01:12:41.790
I want mac and cheese.

01:12:41.792 --> 01:12:43.625
Oh, baby, I think we're out,

01:12:43.627 --> 01:12:45.760
but I can make it from scratch.

01:12:45.762 --> 01:12:48.563
Mm, I like it from a box.
(LAUGHS)

01:12:48.565 --> 01:12:49.798
Okay.

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:51.866
I'll run to the store
and get some.

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:55.003
No, you don't have to do that.

01:12:55.005 --> 01:12:58.640
Baby, I love looking after you.

01:12:58.642 --> 01:13:01.343
Anything else
you want me to get?

01:13:01.345 --> 01:13:04.479
Did you call the school
about my cellphone?

01:13:04.481 --> 01:13:06.348
Nobody's turned it in.

01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:08.316
Oh. I want
to go look for it.

01:13:08.318 --> 01:13:10.385
We did that already, honey.
I talked to the office,

01:13:10.387 --> 01:13:11.820
and they said
nobody's turned it in.

01:13:11.822 --> 01:13:13.521
Well, I want to go look again,

01:13:13.523 --> 01:13:14.856
because somebody
took it, so...

01:13:14.858 --> 01:13:16.358
Don't get so upset.

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:18.493
It's probably just
in the house somewhere.

01:13:18.495 --> 01:13:20.095
I'm sure I can find it.

01:13:21.797 --> 01:13:23.665
(SIGHS)

01:13:23.667 --> 01:13:25.667
Maybe I'll go back to sleep.

01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:27.335
I think that's a good idea.

01:13:27.337 --> 01:13:29.104
I'm gonna run to the store,

01:13:29.106 --> 01:13:31.673
and I'll wake you up
when it's time for dinner.

01:13:31.675 --> 01:13:33.942
There's nothing like
a warm mac and cheese

01:13:33.944 --> 01:13:37.112
to make all your troubles
fly away, hmm?

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:53.895
HoneyDaddies. This is Miles.
How can I help you?

01:13:53.897 --> 01:13:55.096
Finally.
I'm calling again

01:13:55.098 --> 01:13:56.765

on your pervy website.

worried about you!

you were drinking.

I don't want to live.

01:21:49.137 --> 01:21:51.839
I was an only child
just like you,

01:21:51.841 --> 01:21:55.243
and I... I know what
it's like, and it's lonely,

01:21:55.245 --> 01:21:59.447
and I tried to give you
a baby brother or a sister,

01:21:59.449 --> 01:22:01.916
but I kept losing them,

01:22:01.918 --> 01:22:05.953
my poor, beautiful babies.

01:22:08.857 --> 01:22:13.194
Then the doctor said that it was
too dangerous to try anymore,

01:22:13.196 --> 01:22:15.196
and that's when
your father left.

01:22:15.198 --> 01:22:16.430

01:22:16.432 --> 01:22:19.267

I'm so proud and so happy

01:22:22.205 --> 01:22:25.506
that you have so many friends
and you're so popular

01:22:25.508 --> 01:22:29.577
and you're into projects and on
teams and you run for office,

01:22:29.579 --> 01:22:32.914
and you're just...
You're so amazing,

01:22:32.916 --> 01:22:34.949
and that's why I wanted...

01:22:34.951 --> 01:22:38.052
I wanted you to feel like
you were part of something.

01:22:38.054 --> 01:22:40.288
Then why did you ruin it?

01:22:40.290 --> 01:22:45.626

can't lose another baby.

01:22:58.207 --> 01:23:01.242
Emily doesn't even care
about your four-year plan!

01:23:01.244 --> 01:23:04.245
Stay out of my life!

01:23:04.247 --> 01:23:05.246
Cat!

01:23:05.248 --> 01:23:08.149
Baby, don't. Don't!

01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:11.986
(SHRIEKS)
Oh, my God!

01:23:11.988 --> 01:23:13.988
MRS. HARDY:
Leave us alone!

01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:15.923
Stop it! No!
Just leave us alone.

01:23:15.925 --> 01:23:17.458
Get off!

01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:18.593
Stop it!
Can't take my daughter!

01:23:18.595 --> 01:23:20.528
You can't have my daughter!

01:23:20.530 --> 01:23:21.662
Stop!
(SCREAMS)

01:23:24.933 --> 01:23:26.334
OPERATOR: 911.
What's your emergency?

01:23:26.336 --> 01:23:27.468
It's my mother!

01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:29.370
She's attacking my best friend!

01:23:29.372 --> 01:23:31.405
Please hurry!

01:23:31.407 --> 01:23:32.540
Let go!

01:23:32.542 --> 01:23:34.108
Let go!

01:23:34.110 --> 01:23:35.176
Let go!

01:23:36.278 --> 01:23:37.411
Let go!

01:23:37.413 --> 01:23:39.413
Let go! Get off!

01:23:39.415 --> 01:23:41.482
Look at yourself!

01:23:41.484 --> 01:23:43.684
Look at what you're doing!

01:23:43.686 --> 01:23:46.087
Look at what you're doing!

01:23:48.724 --> 01:23:50.558
(COUGHS)

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:52.660
Em! Em!

01:23:52.662 --> 01:23:53.728
Breathe.

01:23:53.730 --> 01:23:55.262
Breathe.

01:23:55.264 --> 01:23:57.331
Breathe. You okay?

01:23:58.367 --> 01:24:01.068
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Police!

01:24:02.137 --> 01:24:03.704
No!
Hey, Hey!

01:24:03.706 --> 01:24:06.374
That's enough.
That's enough.

01:24:06.376 --> 01:24:07.708
Ma'am, that's enough.

01:24:07.710 --> 01:24:09.510
Calm down.

01:24:09.512 --> 01:24:11.045
Calm down.
Cat!

01:24:11.047 --> 01:24:12.613
Oh, Cat!

01:24:12.615 --> 01:24:13.614
Cat!

01:24:13.616 --> 01:24:14.615
That's enough.

01:24:14.617 --> 01:24:16.317
Cat! Cat!
(CRYING)

01:24:16.319 --> 01:24:17.318
Calm down, ma'am.

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:19.353
Cat!

01:24:23.592 --> 01:24:25.593
(CRYING)

01:24:25.595 --> 01:24:27.595
(POLICE DISPATCH CHATTER)

01:24:37.539 --> 01:24:39.173
Mom.

01:24:39.175 --> 01:24:43.077
My baby. My baby.

01:25:16.545 --> 01:25:19.613
Better get off that thing.
We don't want to be late for class,

01:25:19.615 --> 01:25:22.349
especially after the way Professor
Claude chewed us out last time.

01:25:22.351 --> 01:25:24.251
Okay, I'm almost done.

01:25:25.387 --> 01:25:28.189
Hmm, Daniel sent you
another one.

01:25:28.191 --> 01:25:30.458
So romantic how he
sends you real mail.

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:33.494
Jeez, aren't you
ever gonna forgive him?

01:25:33.496 --> 01:25:35.229
I know what he did
was messed up,

01:25:35.231 --> 01:25:37.098
but he had...
did have a lot going on

01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:38.132
with that whole
birth-mom situation.

01:25:38.134 --> 01:25:39.567
I do forgive him.

01:25:39.569 --> 01:25:41.469
But?

01:25:42.671 --> 01:25:44.672
I can't forget.

01:25:44.674 --> 01:25:47.508
Well, plainly that
was a bonehead move.

01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:49.677
However, you did look very
hot in those pictures.

01:25:49.679 --> 01:25:51.579
(LAUGHS) Yeah.
At least I'll have something

01:25:51.581 --> 01:25:52.847
to show my future grandchildren.

01:25:52.849 --> 01:25:54.682
(LAUGHS)
(COMPUTER CHIMES)

01:25:54.684 --> 01:25:57.518
Oh. It's my mom.

01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:59.453
I'm out.

01:26:01.089 --> 01:26:02.590
She feels really bad.

01:26:02.592 --> 01:26:04.825
She asks about you
all the time.

01:26:04.827 --> 01:26:09.230
Cool, but I can't forget
either, so see you in class.

01:26:14.369 --> 01:26:15.369
Hi, Mom.

01:26:15.371 --> 01:26:19.774
Hi, baby. How are you?
Good. Really busy.

01:26:19.776 --> 01:26:21.242
How are you doing?

01:26:21.244 --> 01:26:23.410
I love it.
How are you feeling?

01:26:23.412 --> 01:26:25.780
I'm good.

01:26:25.782 --> 01:26:28.415
Still getting used
to being in here.

01:26:28.417 --> 01:26:30.584
Don't think I ever will.

01:26:31.686 --> 01:26:33.854
I've been doing some painting.

01:26:33.856 --> 01:26:36.690
Are they still trying
to adjust your medication?

01:26:36.692 --> 01:26:40.194
Yeah.
I feel like a lab rat.

01:26:40.196 --> 01:26:44.198
This last combination,
I've been on for, like, a week now.

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:46.801
They say it could still take some time
to get it right.

01:26:48.403 --> 01:26:50.471
It seems like it's working.

01:26:50.473 --> 01:26:53.541
Haven't tried to kill
anyone lately.

01:26:53.543 --> 01:26:56.477
You can't blame yourself
for a chemical imbalance.

01:26:56.479 --> 01:26:58.279
Yeah.

01:26:58.281 --> 01:27:01.315
I know. That's what
my therapist says.

01:27:01.317 --> 01:27:02.850
Now you're sounding like her.

01:27:02.852 --> 01:27:04.919
Mom, be patient.

01:27:09.157 --> 01:27:11.625
Uh, I've gotta go.

01:27:14.796 --> 01:27:18.732
Um, you're making progress.
I can tell.

01:27:18.734 --> 01:27:22.903
Don't get discouraged.
I love you, baby.

01:27:24.906 --> 01:27:25.973
Bye.
