00:15.015 --> 00:16.158
- Ready?
- Okay.

00:26.068 --> 00:27.069
Dad.

01:29.839 --> 01:30.839
One batch...

01:32.675 --> 01:33.675
two batch.

01:34.469 --> 01:35.595
Penny and dime.

01:46.856 --> 01:48.483
Here he comes!

01:50.818 --> 01:54.030
- Welcome home.
- The one that got away!

01:54.114 --> 01:55.573
Screw you, Punisher, piece of shit!

01:55.657 --> 01:57.284
You're safe back in Mexico.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.494
Punisher comes to Juarez,
we'll kill his ass.

02:03.290 --> 02:08.294
The last survivor of the cartel
deserves a reward.

02:48.668 --> 02:53.631
Flight 1513
to Dublin, Ireland, boarding at Gate 31.

02:53.715 --> 02:58.345
Again, that's Flight 1513
to Dublin at Gate 31.

02:59.470 --> 03:01.890
Hey, it's Mickey.
Yeah, anyone else make it?

03:02.682 --> 03:04.309
Oh, shit, I'm the only one left?

03:05.059 --> 03:07.395
No, I'm good. I'm good.
Yeah, about to board.

03:08.646 --> 03:12.442
Tell Dublin to get ready for a big party.
I'm on my way.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.306
Please don't...

03:25.330 --> 03:28.207
You won. You... you killed everyone.

03:28.291 --> 03:31.586
The bikers, the cartels,
the Kitchen Irish... they're all gone.

03:31.669 --> 03:34.756
- Yeah. Yeah, almost.
- I get it.

03:34.839 --> 03:36.424
An eye for an eye and all that.

03:36.508 --> 03:38.676
- I got a family of my own.
- I don't.

03:38.760 --> 03:42.597
For God's sake, man,
killing me is not gonna bring yours back.

03:42.680 --> 03:45.683
- What does it change if I'm dead?
- Nothing.

03:49.812 --> 03:51.856
Oh, God.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.737
Jeez.

03:57.820 --> 04:00.823
- Can you believe that?
- Get a room, you dirty bastards!

04:00.907 --> 04:04.077
Flight 1513 to Dublin,
Ireland, is now boarding.

06:00.735 --> 06:01.736
Yo!

06:04.989 --> 06:08.451
- Are you the new guy?
- Yeah. Uh, Donny Chavez.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.954
All right, let's see how you do.
Come on.

06:33.601 --> 06:34.852
That's the gimp.

06:34.936 --> 06:37.564
Don't worry about him. He ain't all there.

06:54.456 --> 06:57.041
- That's the shit.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:01.212 --> 07:03.923
Yo! Castiglione!

07:06.092 --> 07:08.928
Hey, dumbass... lunch time.

07:14.058 --> 07:16.728
- Retard loves that hammer.
- Yeah.

08:24.086 --> 08:25.963
The rice is ready!

09:38.995 --> 09:41.205
Hey, sleepyhead.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.050
This goddamn guy.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.177
He's crazy, Lance.
What are you gonna do?

09:55.261 --> 09:56.929
Hey, what's the story with you, man?

09:58.305 --> 10:00.099
Here early, here late.

10:01.392 --> 10:04.520
You know if they don't ask you to work
extra, they don't pay you for it, right?

10:04.604 --> 10:06.939
- Right?
- But you knew that, right?

10:08.733 --> 10:10.109
You got a tongue in your head?

10:10.693 --> 10:12.862
I don't know what your deal is, man.

10:12.945 --> 10:16.240
I'm guessing, uh, "elevator don't go
up to the penthouse" type thing.

10:16.323 --> 10:18.743
Hey, whatever, right?

10:18.826 --> 10:23.122
But this shit you do, that's hurting us.

10:23.873 --> 10:26.042
Because of you,
we're getting less overtime.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.210
Kick his ass, Lance.
Maybe he'd understand that.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.212
Wise up, window licker.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.464
All right. All right.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.429
- Shit, there go the PB and Js.
- There he is.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.437
You don't want me for an enemy, man.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.846
- You gotta be kiddin'!
- All this talk.

11:02.870 --> 11:04.640
- Why don't we make it interesting?
- Yo!

11:04.664 --> 11:06.016
I would whup your butt.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.142
- Put money on it.
- All right.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.293
- Fifty. Hundred.
- Oh, big talk. Big talk.

11:09.376 --> 11:11.021
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna whup your ass.

11:11.045 --> 11:12.088
Easy money.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.491
- We'll see.
- Can I come?

11:13.839 --> 11:15.383
No room.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.825
This is high, man. Shit.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.162
I'm Donny.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.085
You can see forever up here, huh?

11:57.049 --> 11:58.717
- This why you come up here?
- Hmm.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.097
I come up here because no one else does.

12:05.016 --> 12:06.017
Yeah.

12:10.437 --> 12:11.730
Pete, right?

12:13.900 --> 12:20.031
Well, Pete, my grandma makes
the best sandwich in the five boroughs.

12:20.614 --> 12:23.242
And you ain't gonna know that
unless you try one.

12:31.125 --> 12:34.045
Come on, man. A man's gotta eat.

12:34.128 --> 12:36.505
Especially the way you're throwing
that hammer.

12:36.588 --> 12:38.674
Like Cool Hand Luke or something.

12:38.757 --> 12:40.759
One-man chain gang.
You like that movie?

12:40.843 --> 12:43.137
I take one of those sandwiches,
you stop talking?

12:45.139 --> 12:46.307
No promises.

12:52.188 --> 12:53.355
Appreciate it.

12:55.316 --> 12:56.483
You know...

12:58.861 --> 13:00.612
everyone thinks you're a retard.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.367
But I knew you wasn't.

13:09.205 --> 13:11.332
Lance shouldn't have done that, man.

13:11.415 --> 13:14.251
Everyone's just worried
about making money, that's all.

13:15.294 --> 13:17.588
Shit, I could use the overtime myself.

13:17.671 --> 13:20.799
I ain't worked in a while
and I gotta pay for my grandma's meds.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.142
Those are some serious scars, man.

13:32.436 --> 13:34.146
- That one a bullet hole?
- Yeah.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.272
Shit.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.192
You some sort of secret badass, Pete?

13:39.861 --> 13:41.820
- Marine Corps.
- Yeah?

13:41.904 --> 13:42.904
Yeah.

13:43.530 --> 13:44.823
My pa was in the corps.

13:45.991 --> 13:48.494
Yeah. In the 1/2 down in North Carolina.

13:48.994 --> 13:51.330
He was like a superhero to me
or something.

13:52.957 --> 13:54.500
Except they don't die, right?

13:58.128 --> 13:59.338
I'm sorry to hear that.

14:01.382 --> 14:03.092
My pa, he served three tours.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.845
Iraq twice, Afghanistan.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.935
Then him and my ma were coming back
from a movie one night...

14:13.811 --> 14:16.856
and got clipped by some kid
who had just passed his driving test.

14:20.317 --> 14:22.444
I woke up the next morning,
they were just gone.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.783
You got family?

14:29.826 --> 14:31.037
I was 12.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.790
I had to come up here,
live with my grandma.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.335
She's the only person I got left.

14:40.546 --> 14:41.964
Dad, look.

14:43.299 --> 14:44.884
It's hard...

14:49.846 --> 14:52.391
...took the fall
for some guys I hung out with...

14:54.351 --> 14:55.811
but I never gave 'em up.

14:57.813 --> 14:59.606
Semper Fi, right?

14:59.690 --> 15:03.777
Look, Donny. Thanks for the sandwich.
You know, I... appreciate that.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.239
But I'm not looking for a pal, yeah?

15:09.533 --> 15:12.786
Whatever it is you're looking for...
I'm not it.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.499
Yeah... okay.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.253
There's a story I heard.

15:21.837 --> 15:23.732
There's a soldier in a hole
and he can't get out,

15:23.756 --> 15:24.965
so he yells for help.

15:25.132 --> 15:29.511
An NCO comes by and says,
"Suck it up, son. Dig deep."

15:29.803 --> 15:31.055
And gives the soldier a shovel.

15:32.431 --> 15:35.309
The soldier does as he's told
and digs that hole deeper.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.769
Then an officer comes by,

15:37.853 --> 15:41.065
says, "Hell, son, use the tools
your NCO gave you."

15:41.482 --> 15:42.983
And throws him a bucket.

15:43.359 --> 15:46.988
So the trooper in the hole
uses the shovel to fill that bucket,

15:47.071 --> 15:48.906
and the hole was deeper still, right?

15:49.490 --> 15:53.995
Next up, psychiatrist comes by
and offers him drugs, tells him,

15:54.078 --> 15:56.705
"This is gonna help you
forget about the hole."

15:56.788 --> 15:57.957
And they do.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.376
But then the pills run out.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.545
Then a soldier comes up,
a guy just like him,

16:03.629 --> 16:07.216
covered in mud and dirt,
and he hears the yells for help.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.719
And that filthy soldier
jumps down in the hole, too.

16:10.802 --> 16:12.388
And the kid, he freaks out.

16:12.471 --> 16:15.641
"What are you doing?
Now we're both stuck in a hole."

16:16.808 --> 16:18.852
And the filthy soldier just smiles...

16:19.811 --> 16:22.982
and says, "Calm down, buddy.
I've been here before.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.442
I know how to get out."

16:27.152 --> 16:29.488
Got a couple of new faces in here today.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.656
Welcome.

16:30.947 --> 16:33.200
If you wanna talk, talk.

16:33.284 --> 16:35.995
If you just wanna listen,
that's all good, too.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.914
No judgment here,
just brothers and sisters who understand.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.667
Only thing you've got to understand
is the world isn't changing.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.920
The real persecuted minority
in this country today...

16:45.504 --> 16:50.634
- is the Christian American patriot.
- Oh, here we go with the same bullshit.

16:50.718 --> 16:54.096
You're blind, asshole.
Don't rag on me because I can see.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.389
Kiss my ass, cracker.

16:55.472 --> 16:58.850
Isaac, let O'Connor finish his piece,
the same way you do

16:58.934 --> 17:01.496
when we get a blow-by-blow account
of your week's titty bar action.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.897
Blow-by-blow is right.

17:03.980 --> 17:09.569
We've got to do something
about the liberal, do-gooding assholes

17:09.653 --> 17:11.821
who are running this country
into the ground.

17:11.905 --> 17:14.282
The ones who want to take
our rights and our guns.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.578
Anyone else got a take?

17:19.621 --> 17:24.542
I just know that I fought for this country
and that it's got no place for me.

17:27.796 --> 17:30.674
I don't know what the rules
are anymore, you know?

17:31.258 --> 17:34.344
They're scared, man.
Because they aren't stupid.

17:34.928 --> 17:39.015
They spent 15 years training an army
and then abandoned it on the streets.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.103
A time is gonna come
when we have to defend ourselves

17:42.186 --> 17:44.605
and... and put things back
to how they were.

17:44.688 --> 17:47.066
You love this country,
you better be ready,

17:47.149 --> 17:48.859
'cause the next war's gonna be here.

17:49.901 --> 17:52.404
Blood will flow in the streets.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.740
Sic semper tyrannis.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.118
"Thus always to tyrants"?

17:58.952 --> 18:01.247
You really think our governments
are tyrants, Lewis?

18:05.918 --> 18:09.963
All I know is that we risked our lives
and we did terrible things...

18:10.339 --> 18:12.258
and it meant nothing when we got home.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.021
How you sleeping, Lewis?

18:26.105 --> 18:30.066
Uh, better. I work a lot but, uh, better.

18:30.817 --> 18:32.111
Group helps.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.157
I've been reading a lot.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.576
Perspective is good.

18:40.494 --> 18:41.703
- Mmm-hmm.
- But...

18:42.788 --> 18:45.040
the answers have to be your own.

18:47.459 --> 18:50.921
You have to take an honest look in here
before we look anywhere else.

18:51.838 --> 18:52.839
All right?

18:56.760 --> 18:58.053
I'll see you next time.

18:58.970 --> 19:00.472
Take care of yourself, Lewis.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.363
Was a good meeting, Curt.

19:18.740 --> 19:20.117
There he is.

19:20.409 --> 19:23.620
- You good?
- I'm copacetic, Frank. You?

19:23.704 --> 19:26.165
Oh, yeah. Great.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.625
- It's been a while.
- Yeah, I'm a slow reader.

19:28.709 --> 19:29.709
Yeah.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.003
- I appreciate it.
- Right.

19:32.087 --> 19:33.255
I really enjoyed it.

19:34.465 --> 19:35.507
Like I told Lewis...

19:37.509 --> 19:40.971
books are great,
but they don't hold all the answers.

19:42.055 --> 19:44.140
- Can I get some coffee?
- Help yourself.

19:45.517 --> 19:47.186
Lewis drives a cab all night.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.272
I don't think it's a coincidence, either.

19:50.356 --> 19:54.025
I suspect he talks to himself
in the mirror.

19:55.277 --> 19:59.240
And that's part of the problem, Frank.
Nobody wants to be themselves anymore.

20:00.699 --> 20:05.120
Internet, social media,
goddamn talent shows for assholes...

20:06.247 --> 20:08.790
Everybody wants to be somebody else.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.210
Nobody...

20:12.669 --> 20:16.757
is happy just to look at themselves
in the mirror, see themselves.

20:16.840 --> 20:19.384
Then it means they don't have
to be responsible either.

20:20.844 --> 20:22.221
So what about you, Frank?

20:23.138 --> 20:24.738
What is it gonna take to make you happy?

20:26.183 --> 20:28.101
Come on. "Happy"?

20:28.560 --> 20:31.146
Happy is a kick in the balls
waiting to happen.

20:32.105 --> 20:33.940
So you kick yourself in the balls first.

20:35.526 --> 20:38.695
That's crazy, Lieutenant.
Look...

20:39.863 --> 20:42.324
you got half a life left to live,
my friend.

20:42.616 --> 20:45.160
If you don't, you might as well be dead.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.955
- Oh, I am dead, Curtis. You didn't hear?
- Bullshit.

20:49.039 --> 20:51.375
You got a name, a passport,
as I recall...

20:52.293 --> 20:53.460
Frank Castle's dead.

20:54.378 --> 20:57.548
Pete Castiglione... he's got a life.

20:58.214 --> 21:02.678
Anybody that had anything to do with what
happened to Maria and the kids are dead.

21:02.761 --> 21:06.014
Mission accomplished.
And I don't have a problem with that.

21:06.097 --> 21:08.137
Hell, if you would've asked me,
I woulda helped you.

21:08.183 --> 21:09.225
I know that.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.938
- I know you would have.
- But that was months ago.

21:13.605 --> 21:15.941
Now the only person
you're punishing is yourself.

21:20.362 --> 21:21.738
Thank you for the coffee.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.583
Hey, Curt.

21:35.460 --> 21:39.506
How often you think about it?
You know, the shit we did over there?

21:40.966 --> 21:42.301
All the time.

21:42.593 --> 21:44.345
But my conscience is clear.

21:45.261 --> 21:48.849
Afghanistan... was different, you know?

21:49.808 --> 21:51.643
- Different how?
- Just different.

21:52.561 --> 21:55.605
Things we did, they...
they kinda got blurred.

21:57.524 --> 21:58.984
What were you into, Frank?

22:01.737 --> 22:04.614
You see, what worries me the most...

22:04.948 --> 22:08.076
is that you've been in a hole so long
that it's become home.

22:09.870 --> 22:12.163
Maybe that's where I'm supposed to be.

22:14.458 --> 22:17.419
Do me a favor, Frank.
Don't be a wallowing asshole.

22:18.670 --> 22:21.465
Before I have to take this fake leg off
and beat you to death with it.

22:24.676 --> 22:26.052
Just imagine your tombstone.

22:26.136 --> 22:29.305
"Frank Castle lose a ass-kicking contest
to a one-legged man."

22:29.390 --> 22:30.974
- I'd do it.
- Yeah.

22:31.057 --> 22:32.851
I'd actually kinda like to see that.

22:32.934 --> 22:34.686
Take care of yourself, Curt.

22:53.830 --> 22:55.081
ID, please?

23:13.349 --> 23:17.145
- So who was this guy to you?
- Ahmad Zubair was my partner.

23:17.228 --> 23:19.481
He was taken from his home in Kandahar,
shot in the head,

23:19.564 --> 23:22.859
- and buried in an unmarked grave.
- That's quite a story.

23:23.234 --> 23:26.447
Doesn't bode well for me
as your newly assigned partner.

23:27.030 --> 23:30.575
It's more than a story.
And Stein... we're not partners.

23:30.659 --> 23:31.743
Sam.

23:33.579 --> 23:36.039
Stein sounds like a large beer glass.

23:36.122 --> 23:39.460
And, uh, according to the assignments,
that's exactly what we are.

23:40.544 --> 23:41.795
Partners, I mean.

23:41.878 --> 23:44.465
Sure, you're the lead agent
with a nice office

23:44.548 --> 23:46.800
and I'm the junior
with the shitty little desk outside,

23:46.883 --> 23:48.969
but... partners nevertheless.

23:49.052 --> 23:51.763
- Gotta earn my trust first.
- Yeah.

23:51.847 --> 23:53.724
That's exactly what I have to do.

23:53.807 --> 23:57.102
Your approval immediately being
the most important thing in my life.

23:58.812 --> 24:02.608
Madani, you really think Wolf
is gonna let you run with all this?

24:03.859 --> 24:07.154
I'm confident I can persuade the SAC
of the case's merits.

24:07.529 --> 24:10.156
Well... I guess you are new here.

24:12.868 --> 24:13.868
Morning, sir.

24:13.910 --> 24:16.590
Back in the country three weeks,
and you already have a case for me.

24:16.663 --> 24:19.332
I brought this one back
from Afghanistan with me, sir.

24:19.415 --> 24:23.044
This man, Ahmad Zubair
of the Afghan National Police,

24:23.128 --> 24:26.047
discovered United States soldiers
were trafficking heroin.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.674
And they killed him for it.

24:29.300 --> 24:30.802
Stein, give us the room.

24:30.886 --> 24:32.888
Sir, uh, as Madani's new partner,

24:32.971 --> 24:34.931
- shouldn't I...
- Close the door on your way out.

24:38.519 --> 24:39.603
You're lucky, Madani.

24:39.686 --> 24:42.313
A lot of people would give their left tit
for this job.

24:42.397 --> 24:45.859
I was happy where I was... tits intact.

24:45.942 --> 24:47.110
Others weren't.

24:48.403 --> 24:52.032
The investigation you were pursuing
in Kandahar was deemed to serve no one.

24:52.365 --> 24:53.408
Deemed by who?

24:53.491 --> 24:56.202
Frankly, you must have
a guardian angel, Madani.

24:56.286 --> 24:59.086
They pulled you out of there before
you did your career some real harm.

24:59.122 --> 25:00.624
I guess you tick a lot of boxes,

25:00.707 --> 25:03.251
because they didn't want
the poster girl embarrassing them.

25:03.334 --> 25:05.170
Wow. That was sexist, racist,

25:05.253 --> 25:08.423
and demeaning of my abilities
all in one sentence, sir. Bravo.

25:08.506 --> 25:11.927
Well, sue me. It's your word against mine.
Kinda like your case here.

25:12.010 --> 25:15.138
The US government gave Ahmad Zubair
our word, and it got him killed.

25:15.221 --> 25:17.641
A place like this,
who knows what got him killed?

25:17.724 --> 25:19.059
He could've been dirty.

25:19.976 --> 25:22.729
I was pulled out of Afghanistan
'cause something stunk to high heaven

25:22.813 --> 25:25.065
and I was close
to finding out exactly what.

25:25.148 --> 25:26.608
And here you are.

25:26.692 --> 25:29.235
Now, I like tenacious
and energetic, Madani.

25:29.319 --> 25:30.946
I find it kinda hot in a woman.

25:31.029 --> 25:33.824
But I will not stand for insubordinate.
Are we clear?

25:33.907 --> 25:35.909
Ask your little buddy Stein about that.

25:36.534 --> 25:40.246
Now, Kandahar is off-limits.
Otherwise, you can quit.

25:42.916 --> 25:45.335
- You're the boss.
- Yes, I am.

25:54.803 --> 25:56.346
I need a drink.

25:56.429 --> 25:58.974
- Murphy's?
- Maybe Rhonda will be working.

25:59.057 --> 26:00.684
Maybe this time you'll speak to her.

26:00.767 --> 26:03.144
- Like she'd notice.
- Bite me, dipshit.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.520
I could use a drink.

26:08.734 --> 26:09.776
Come on, Lance.

26:10.694 --> 26:13.154
Let me come with you guys.
Look, first round's on me.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.823
All right.

26:15.741 --> 26:17.283
Yeah, sure.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.661
Why not, huh? Why not?

26:31.715 --> 26:34.134
- Good meeting with Wolf, huh?
- Peachy.

26:34.217 --> 26:36.803
As your immediate junior
in the chain of command...

26:37.721 --> 26:39.616
am I allowed to ask
how you're feeling about that?

26:39.640 --> 26:41.557
How about you lay off
with the "junior" shit?

26:41.642 --> 26:44.144
I can live without
your wiseass comments right now.

26:44.227 --> 26:46.479
Not really sure what else I have to offer.

26:50.984 --> 26:53.611
You know how I knew
Wolf wouldn't want your case?

26:56.740 --> 26:58.199
You got me for a partner.

27:00.326 --> 27:01.703
You're telling me this why?

27:02.287 --> 27:03.789
You seem like a good person.

27:04.956 --> 27:08.126
Someone with a career in the department
if you really want one.

27:08.209 --> 27:10.712
What did you do to piss him off?

27:14.132 --> 27:15.717
You gotta earn my trust first.

27:18.094 --> 27:19.220
So...

27:20.806 --> 27:22.015
what now?

27:29.439 --> 27:31.399
Now I want you to get me whatever we have

27:31.482 --> 27:34.569
on a Marine Force Recon colonel
called Schoonover,

27:34.652 --> 27:37.238
the explosion and drug bust
at the 41st Street docks last year,

27:37.322 --> 27:39.783
and everything available
on one of his men,

27:39.866 --> 27:41.492
Lieutenant Frank Castle.

27:42.327 --> 27:44.955
The Punisher? He's dead.

27:46.247 --> 27:49.209
Castle and Schoonover
served in Afghanistan, same unit,

27:49.292 --> 27:52.838
then both are dead one day
and 20 miles apart...

27:52.921 --> 27:54.255
right here in New York.

27:55.465 --> 27:56.967
That strike you as a coincidence?

27:59.677 --> 28:02.638
- You're gonna run with this anyway?
- Do you have a problem with that?

28:05.517 --> 28:06.517
No.

28:07.643 --> 28:09.437
I'm already on the shit pile.

28:11.231 --> 28:16.069
Just surprised a hotshot like you
is so eager to join me there.

28:19.989 --> 28:21.199
Rhonda!

28:21.657 --> 28:25.161
Five more beers and...
and five more shots of that good stuff

28:25.245 --> 28:27.956
for me and my new pals here.

28:28.039 --> 28:30.583
Last round, and then I'm closing up.

28:30.666 --> 28:33.044
He pukes, you assholes are cleaning it up,
all right?

28:33.128 --> 28:35.380
You hear that? Keep it together, Donny.

28:35.463 --> 28:36.882
Hey.

28:38.383 --> 28:39.760
I need to pull another job.

28:40.468 --> 28:44.723
I got this... Gnucci loan shark.
This guy's up my ass.

28:44.806 --> 28:48.643
Prick is threatening to break my legs,
take my car, the whole thing.

28:51.687 --> 28:54.024
Man, what were you thinking?

28:54.107 --> 28:56.317
What were you thinking
taking money off those guys?

28:56.401 --> 28:58.361
What'd you think was gonna happen?

28:58.444 --> 28:59.821
You got something for me or not?

29:00.405 --> 29:02.741
- Thanks, Rhonda.
- Yeah.

29:02.824 --> 29:05.201
Yeah, all right.
Just take it easy, man, okay? I'll, uh...

29:06.453 --> 29:09.497
I'll call my cousin. All right?
See if he can hook us up again.

29:09.956 --> 29:12.918
- Soon, Paulie. Soon.
- Yeah. Okay. All right. All right. Okay.

29:13.001 --> 29:14.335
I'll call him tonight, all right?

29:14.419 --> 29:16.212
- Whoa.
- Whoa!

29:16.296 --> 29:17.588
Keep it together, Donny.

29:17.672 --> 29:20.008
- The state of this guy, man.
- She's looking, man.

29:21.885 --> 29:22.928
Your check.

29:27.265 --> 29:28.474
Pay the lady.

29:30.393 --> 29:32.520
What? You said you were buying, right?

29:42.405 --> 29:43.406
Yeah. Yeah.

29:43.489 --> 29:44.950
All right.

29:45.033 --> 29:47.410
- Yeah!
- Heck, yeah!

29:47.493 --> 29:49.495
- I knew you were buying.
- Big bucks.

29:59.130 --> 30:02.300
Hey, sleepyhead.

30:02.383 --> 30:03.885
- Hey.
- Hi.

30:11.017 --> 30:13.895
- What time is it?
- It's 10:30.

30:16.356 --> 30:17.941
You needed your sleep.

30:18.524 --> 30:19.525
Yeah.

30:19.609 --> 30:21.903
There's plenty of time
now that you're home.

30:33.498 --> 30:35.138
My cousin came through big time.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.210
All right. All right.
What's the job, huh?

30:37.293 --> 30:39.337
It's a poker game. High stakes.

30:39.420 --> 30:41.965
Fifty, maybe even seventy grand.

30:42.048 --> 30:44.843
I know. I know.
They got a "no guns at the table" rule.

30:44.926 --> 30:48.138
Except for one guard standing at the door.
We go in...

30:48.721 --> 30:51.557
we take out the guard,
the two of us cover the room.

30:51.641 --> 30:54.686
One of us scoops up the cash,
and one outside in the car.

30:55.103 --> 30:58.481
What's the catch?
Why isn't someone hitting this every week?

30:59.232 --> 31:01.985
It's protected by the Gnuccis.

31:02.735 --> 31:03.987
Are you crazy?

31:04.070 --> 31:05.655
You want to hit an outfit game?

31:05.738 --> 31:08.738
- I don't know, Paulie. Paulie, this is...
- Hey. Don't be a pussy.

31:08.783 --> 31:11.161
And besides, I thought...

31:11.244 --> 31:15.290
you'd like the idea of paying back
the Gnuccis' shylock with his own cash.

31:15.373 --> 31:16.917
- Yeah, I do.
- There we go.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.543
- I do.
- Attaboy. Attaboy.

31:18.626 --> 31:20.378
All right.

31:22.213 --> 31:23.214
Who's that?

31:25.050 --> 31:26.176
Look who it is...

31:27.886 --> 31:30.096
Captain Batshit.

31:31.264 --> 31:32.765
Were you listening to us?

31:34.059 --> 31:35.060
Hmm?

31:35.643 --> 31:36.644
Hmm?

31:36.727 --> 31:39.564
Everywhere I turn,
there you are, pissing me off.

31:41.691 --> 31:42.901
Now, you...

31:44.610 --> 31:46.654
you need to mind your own business.

31:47.780 --> 31:50.033
Putting your nose
where it don't belong, huh?

31:50.741 --> 31:52.160
What?

31:52.243 --> 31:53.995
What? What do you wanna do?

31:54.079 --> 31:55.080
Huh?

31:56.456 --> 31:57.540
What do you wanna do?

31:59.084 --> 32:00.710
Whoa, where you goin'? Where you goin'?

32:00.793 --> 32:01.836
Oh, where you goin'?

32:04.923 --> 32:06.549
You're gonna get hurt, gimp.

32:10.178 --> 32:11.554
Oh.

32:11.637 --> 32:14.349
Oh, you wanna do something
with that hammer?

32:14.432 --> 32:16.434
Huh? You wanna... You wanna do something?

32:16.517 --> 32:18.519
What do you wanna do? You wanna take me?

32:18.603 --> 32:20.480
I'm right here.

32:20.563 --> 32:22.398
I ain't going anywhere.

32:22.482 --> 32:25.151
And I will mess you up
without breaking a sweat.

32:25.235 --> 32:27.278
Are we clear on that? Huh?

32:28.404 --> 32:31.074
Yeah, you better stay out of my way,

32:31.157 --> 32:33.576
or that hammer's gonna find
a new home up your ass.

32:33.659 --> 32:36.454
Do you understand?

32:38.414 --> 32:40.541
- Yeah, that's it.
- Huh?

32:44.587 --> 32:46.672
Shit!

32:51.719 --> 32:53.096
Call somebody. Hurry up!

32:56.724 --> 32:58.809
Jesus! You can see the bone!

32:58.893 --> 33:00.478
All right. Call an ambulance.

33:00.561 --> 33:01.801
You were in the Marines, right?

33:01.854 --> 33:04.607
You must know first aid or field medicine
or something! Come on!

33:17.412 --> 33:19.330
We gotta cancel tonight.

33:19.414 --> 33:21.957
No, man.
My cousin will think we pussied out.

33:22.042 --> 33:24.377
I thought you needed the money.

33:25.211 --> 33:27.838
- I do.
- Then let's do it, huh?

33:27.922 --> 33:29.632
We got nothing to worry about.
Don't worry.

33:34.720 --> 33:36.639
- Hey. Hey, hey...
- Hmm?

33:36.722 --> 33:39.350
- What about him?
- Him?

33:39.434 --> 33:42.062
- You can't be serious.
- What? He's no virgin.

33:42.145 --> 33:44.897
Hey, Donny. Come here.

33:49.110 --> 33:52.697
- That was messed up, huh?
- Yeah, shitty luck. For him, for us.

33:53.781 --> 33:56.826
Hey, look, we got a thing tonight.
Make us some real money.

33:56.909 --> 34:00.580
But... Scut going down
has left us a man short.

34:00.663 --> 34:03.958
I ain't gonna lie to you, Donny.
This ain't exactly... legal.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.544
- You got the balls for it?
- Hey, man, I got plenty of balls.

34:06.627 --> 34:08.420
I don't doubt it. So you in?

34:10.547 --> 34:13.652
- No, man. I need to know more about it.
- Nah. You're in or you're not.

34:13.676 --> 34:17.804
Serious money, hour's work.
Huh? You'd be doing us a solid.

34:19.014 --> 34:20.141
Yeah.

34:20.225 --> 34:22.393
- All right, I'll help you out.
- All right.

34:22.476 --> 34:23.893
All right. He's growing up, huh?

34:23.978 --> 34:25.480
- One of the boys.
- He's growing up.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.482
All right,
help us clean this shit up.

34:28.483 --> 34:29.734
All right, over here.

34:46.251 --> 34:49.670
Why is it that you resent
being home so much, do you think?

34:49.754 --> 34:53.632
I resent being forced to come back.
I resent that no one is hiding that fact.

34:53.716 --> 34:56.802
Mostly, I...
I resent that no one wants the truth.

34:56.886 --> 35:00.848
I just want you to be sure
that this case of yours isn't just a way

35:00.931 --> 35:03.559
to avoid dealing with losing someone
you were close to.

35:03.643 --> 35:06.437
I didn't lose anyone. They killed him.

35:07.772 --> 35:09.774
I told Ahmad he could trust us.

35:11.234 --> 35:12.693
Told him he could trust me.

35:16.864 --> 35:19.367
How much are you drinking these days?

35:19.450 --> 35:22.412
Jesus, Mom. Now and then.

35:22.495 --> 35:25.790
Maybe more now I'm home and have access
to your $100 a bottle stuff.

35:27.208 --> 35:29.877
I know your heart is in the right place,
but I don't need therapy.

35:30.295 --> 35:32.255
Definitely not from you. No offense.

35:33.256 --> 35:34.507
None taken.

35:35.425 --> 35:37.260
That. That right there.

35:37.343 --> 35:39.929
That is why therapy
would never work for me.

35:40.012 --> 35:41.139
Talking to you is like...

35:41.222 --> 35:43.474
It's like interviewing a suspect
you know has the answers

35:43.558 --> 35:44.892
and just smiles in your face.

35:44.975 --> 35:49.147
That's not about being a psychiatrist.
It's about being your mother.

35:51.691 --> 35:53.108
Nice to have you back.

35:57.738 --> 35:59.740
Nice to share this with you.

36:01.909 --> 36:03.369
It's temporary.

36:04.745 --> 36:06.497
Just till I find a place.

36:10.001 --> 36:14.130
Every night, I drink a glass of wine
over dinner with your father.

36:15.047 --> 36:16.757
He usually pours it for me.

36:17.633 --> 36:21.387
And not once in almost 40 years
has he joined me.

36:22.388 --> 36:25.141
His faith is as strong as my lack of it.

36:25.641 --> 36:30.355
I sometimes ask him,
"How can a surgeon believe in God?"

36:31.314 --> 36:33.274
He says he would go mad

36:33.358 --> 36:37.069
if he couldn't see some kind
of guiding principle in the world.

36:38.196 --> 36:41.324
I have faith in a system. Our system.

36:41.407 --> 36:45.411
The one that took you and Dad in
and made you wealthy and respected.

36:46.662 --> 36:48.498
This country gave us freedom.

36:49.874 --> 36:52.543
But it's fragile. It needs protection.

36:54.504 --> 36:56.839
Your father's faith in God doesn't mean

36:56.922 --> 36:59.467
that he cannot see the flaws
in his religion.

37:00.301 --> 37:02.762
Why don't you tell me what it is
you're trying to say, Mom?

37:04.847 --> 37:09.477
This case of yours is heresy, Dinah.
You've been told as much.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.313
What you're doing scares me.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.151
I don't want to see your head on a plate.

37:53.228 --> 37:54.229
Keep it runnin'.

38:03.781 --> 38:05.283
Let's boogaloo.

38:28.723 --> 38:30.923
Get up. Come on, move your ass!

38:31.476 --> 38:32.768
Nobody move! Nobody!

38:32.852 --> 38:35.270
- Or you get what he got! Eyes down.
- Stay down!

38:38.483 --> 38:40.318
Hey. Bag the cash!

38:44.071 --> 38:47.367
- Shit.
- All right, listen up, fellas.

38:47.450 --> 38:49.619
This is gonna go nice and easy.

38:49.702 --> 38:52.788
We know none of you is packing.
So no heroics, huh?

38:52.872 --> 38:54.374
You boys should leave while you can.

38:54.457 --> 38:56.792
Shut up, greaseball,
or you'll get what he got.

38:56.876 --> 38:59.316
- Eyes on the table!
- Do you know whose game this is?

38:59.795 --> 39:02.507
I guess not.
Otherwise you wouldn't be here.

39:02.590 --> 39:07.053
Or maybe we don't give a shit
about you oily Gnucci shitbags.

39:07.553 --> 39:09.393
- You're all dead.
- Come on, let's go.

39:09.430 --> 39:11.223
- Let's go!
- Hurry up!

39:11.306 --> 39:12.975
Move. Move. Move. Move!

39:13.893 --> 39:16.354
Let's go. Don't look at him!
Eyes on the table!

39:16.437 --> 39:19.440
You got any sense, kid,
you'll drop that bag and walk away.

39:20.441 --> 39:23.110
Don't speak again, asshole.

39:23.193 --> 39:24.278
Or what?

39:27.114 --> 39:30.117
Hurry up. We don't got all day!
Or we don't get shit!

39:30.200 --> 39:33.954
Take every last one
of these shitbags' dollars! Hurry up!

39:36.832 --> 39:38.000
What are you doing?

39:38.876 --> 39:40.711
- Kid, pick it up!
- Shit.

39:41.754 --> 39:43.297
Let's go!

39:52.222 --> 39:55.393
Shit, you really screwed this up, Donald.

39:56.226 --> 39:58.204
- We gotta cap 'em.
- No! Come on.

39:58.228 --> 40:01.399
- Get out of here. Move! Yo, move!
- Shit.

40:01.482 --> 40:02.983
- Move!
- Come on.

40:21.251 --> 40:23.087
- Hey, sleepyhead.
- What?

40:23.170 --> 40:25.130
- Hey.
- Hi.

40:25.214 --> 40:26.591
Yeah.

40:36.434 --> 40:39.520
- What time is it?
- Mmm. It's 10:30.

40:41.981 --> 40:43.566
You needed your sleep.

40:45.192 --> 40:47.820
There's plenty of time
now that you're home.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.243
I'm gonna go get breakfast.

40:54.326 --> 40:55.745
- Okay.
- Okay.

41:03.168 --> 41:04.211
No!

41:17.517 --> 41:19.519
Dad!

41:19.602 --> 41:21.854
Dad, look!

41:21.937 --> 41:24.273
No!

41:47.713 --> 41:50.340
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

41:50.424 --> 41:53.218
- Give me the gun.
- I made a mistake, man. I'm sorry.

41:53.302 --> 41:55.345
I didn't know whether to...
I figured...

41:55.429 --> 41:56.490
I figured bring my license,

41:56.514 --> 41:58.390
you know,
in case we got stopped by the cops.

41:58.473 --> 42:00.184
To act normal, right?
And I'm sorry, Lance.

42:03.228 --> 42:04.956
He's gotta disappear.
They're gonna look for him.

42:04.980 --> 42:06.857
I wouldn't give you up. I promise.

42:07.482 --> 42:11.028
The shit they'll do to you, man,
you'd be crazy if you didn't.

42:15.825 --> 42:17.385
We have to do this.

42:17.451 --> 42:19.036
- No.
- No. No.

42:19.119 --> 42:21.997
He's gotta disappear.

42:22.957 --> 42:26.418
- Start the mixer.
- Are we really doing this?

42:26.501 --> 42:27.920
Start that thing now!

42:28.003 --> 42:29.379
Please.

42:39.264 --> 42:40.558
What the hell, huh?

42:40.641 --> 42:42.852
- Let's work a little overtime.
- No! No!

42:44.687 --> 42:47.022
Shit! Get him! Come on! Go! Go!

42:47.607 --> 42:50.317
Come on, get him!

42:50.400 --> 42:52.527
- Move! Move, move!
- Shit!

42:52.612 --> 42:53.654
Shit!

42:58.242 --> 43:00.661
- Put it down.
- I'll run. I'll run. Just let me go.

43:00.745 --> 43:03.497
- Can't happen, Donny.
- Just shoot him.

43:06.041 --> 43:08.878
- Forget it. I'll shoot him.
- No. No bullets!

43:19.388 --> 43:22.266
- Get him up!
- No!

43:22.349 --> 43:23.851
All right, let's go.

43:23.934 --> 43:26.061
- No! No!
- Ah, shit!

43:26.979 --> 43:30.440
- Come on!
- No! No! No!

43:30.524 --> 43:33.736
Lance, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I won't say anything, man!

43:35.404 --> 43:37.281
No!

43:37.364 --> 43:40.117
No! No! No! No! No!

43:40.200 --> 43:41.576
- Come on!
- No!

43:43.037 --> 43:46.373
No! No! No!

43:54.548 --> 43:57.217
No!

43:57.301 --> 44:00.054
Lance! No, please!

44:00.137 --> 44:02.807
Lance! Turn it off!

44:02.890 --> 44:04.474
Lance! Please!

44:04.558 --> 44:06.018
You brought this on yourself!

44:06.101 --> 44:08.896
- Please! Help me!
- Shut it off.

44:08.979 --> 44:10.355
Turn it off! Help!

44:10.439 --> 44:13.025
Hey... look, it's the gimp.

44:13.108 --> 44:14.819
Lance!

44:15.610 --> 44:18.948
Turn it off! No!

44:20.700 --> 44:22.860

Oh, God!

God!

No!

46:04.636 --> 46:07.097
Talk.

46:09.183 --> 46:13.312
Okay! Okay!
It's in the basement of a restaurant.

46:13.395 --> 46:15.689
Linello's in Little Italy.

46:15.772 --> 46:17.858
Okay. I told you. Ow!

46:18.608 --> 46:22.988
No, no, no, no. I told you.

46:23.072 --> 46:24.949
What are you gonna do?

46:25.032 --> 46:26.658
I'm gonna find a home for this.

46:26.741 --> 46:27.993
No!

46:34.708 --> 46:35.750
Help!

47:08.450 --> 47:11.120
No one sleeps
until we get these guys.

47:11.203 --> 47:13.330
Start with this kid, Donald Chavez.

47:13.413 --> 47:15.790
My guy in the precinct called
with an address in Queens.

47:15.875 --> 47:17.626
He lives with his grandmother.

47:17.709 --> 47:20.795
Do what you have to
to make him give up the others.

47:22.506 --> 47:25.217
- Christ. Get the circuit breaker.
- You got it.

47:26.218 --> 47:27.362
Heads up!

48:51.928 --> 48:53.347
Oh.

48:53.430 --> 48:54.431
Oh.

48:56.683 --> 48:59.019
Mmm-hmm...

49:00.020 --> 49:01.480
Yeah, man.
