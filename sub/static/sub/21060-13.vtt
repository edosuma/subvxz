-(screaming)
-* Bad boys *

00:11.100 --> 00:12.900
-* Whatcha want,
whatcha want *

00:12.933 --> 00:15.000
* Whatcha gonna do *

00:15.033 --> 00:18.867
-* When the Sheriff John Brown
come for you? *
-Stop! Now! Stop!

00:18.900 --> 00:20.967
-(clattering)
-Heads up!

00:21.000 --> 00:23.467
-* Bad boys, bad boys,
whatcha gonna do... *

00:23.500 --> 00:25.900
I smoked some marijuana!
I'm a marijuana smoker!

00:25.933 --> 00:27.767
-* Bad boys, bad boys *
-Crawl out!

00:27.800 --> 00:29.167
* Whatcha gonna do... *

00:29.200 --> 00:30.400
-Hands up! Hands up!

00:30.433 --> 00:32.300
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Hold it!

00:32.333 --> 00:34.367
-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.400 --> 00:36.467
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.500 --> 00:39.033
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.067 --> 00:42.500
in a court of law.

00:42.533 --> 00:45.100
-I'd have to say,
the most enjoyable
part of my job is,

00:45.133 --> 00:47.533
there's no day
that's the same.

00:47.567 --> 00:51.900
Our squads are proactive squads,
so some days we come in
and we start at 7:00

00:51.933 --> 00:54.900
in the morning, some days
we start at 4:00 in the morning
if we're doin' a search warrant,

00:54.933 --> 00:56.933
and we're always constantly
mixing it up.

00:56.967 --> 00:58.300
I came from the corporate world,

00:58.333 --> 00:59.800
where every day
was kinda the same,

00:59.833 --> 01:05.067
um, day in and day out,
and you can't say that
about this job.

01:05.067 --> 01:07.067
-Hey, we're gonna stop
and talk to this gentleman.

01:07.067 --> 01:11.833
He was walking in the middle
of the roadway before getting
on the sidewalk when he saw us.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.167
And there he-- gonna walk away.

01:16.200 --> 01:17.967
-Hold up, buddy.
-Come here.

01:18.067 --> 01:19.633
-Man: What's up?
-Hold up!

01:19.667 --> 01:20.867
-What?
-Come here.

01:20.900 --> 01:21.967
-For what, man?

01:22.067 --> 01:23.800
-'Cause you're walkin'
in the road.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.267
-I know... (indistinct)

01:25.300 --> 01:27.100
-Come here.
-I didn't do nothing.

01:27.133 --> 01:28.767
-I'm just walkin'.
-Come here.

01:28.800 --> 01:29.933
-Why, man?
-Stop.

01:29.967 --> 01:31.667
-I ain't doin' nothin'.
-Stop right now.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.133
-I ain't doin' nothin'.
-Stop!

01:33.167 --> 01:34.767
-Look, I ain't
doin' nothin', man.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.433
-Stop, or you're gonna
get Tased.

01:36.467 --> 01:39.067
-The only reason why--
-Stop!

01:39.067 --> 01:41.400
-Hey, Carlos.
Hey, man.

01:43.600 --> 01:47.267
-(indistinct shouting)

01:47.300 --> 01:49.267
-Get him! Get him!
Get him!

01:49.300 --> 01:53.100
-(Taser crackling)
-(man yelling)

01:54.633 --> 01:58.200
It hurts! It hurts! Ow!

01:58.233 --> 01:59.233
Ow!

01:59.267 --> 02:02.100
Hey! I'm sorry, man.

02:02.133 --> 02:03.467
Hey, I'm sorry.

02:03.500 --> 02:06.300
Look, I'm so sorry, man.
Look, I'm sorry, man.

02:06.333 --> 02:07.667
-Stop it!
-All right!

02:07.700 --> 02:08.800
-Stop it!
-All right!

02:08.833 --> 02:10.767
-Stop resisting!
-All right!

02:10.800 --> 02:12.600
All right, man!
-Stop resisting!

02:12.633 --> 02:15.833
-I'm not!
Hey, Carlos, look it!

02:15.867 --> 02:17.267
Hey!
-Stop resisting!

02:17.300 --> 02:18.733
-I'm not resisting!

02:18.767 --> 02:21.367
-(sirens wailing)
-Y'all go ahead
and handcuff him.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.200
-Relax!
-I've got two knives, bro.

02:25.233 --> 02:26.867
-Come on!
-Relax!

02:26.900 --> 02:28.567
-All right!
-Relax!

02:28.600 --> 02:31.100
-Guys, I got
a mental health problem.

02:31.133 --> 02:33.400
-Ah, damn. Sorry, sir.

02:33.433 --> 02:36.467
-Why are you--
-I'm here, bro.

02:36.500 --> 02:39.267
-All we asked you to do
was stop and talk to us.
-All right, I'm sorry.

02:39.300 --> 02:42.067
-I know, but all you did--
All we wanted to do
was talk to you.

02:42.100 --> 02:43.167
-Okay, sir.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.667
-Relax. You good?
-Yeah, I'm-- I'm good.

02:45.700 --> 02:47.800
-Okay.
Sit up, buddy.

02:47.833 --> 02:50.067
-(indistinct chatter)

02:50.067 --> 02:52.233
-What's your name?
-Put your feet out.

02:52.267 --> 02:53.467
-All right.
-What's your name?

02:53.500 --> 02:54.533
-Huh?
-What's your name?

02:54.567 --> 02:56.267
-Um... Patrick.

02:56.300 --> 02:58.267
-Patrick?
-Patrick what?

02:58.300 --> 03:01.067
-Why weren't you listening?
-Because I was scared.

03:01.067 --> 03:03.333
-Of what?
-I'm just scared, man.

03:03.367 --> 03:06.867
I-- I got the ADHD stuff,
and I get panic attacks
and everything.

03:06.900 --> 03:10.700
-Simple instructions
to stop, come to us,
stop walking, right?

03:10.733 --> 03:13.067
-Hey, 'cause look,
you see my face?

03:13.067 --> 03:16.600
Because I was-- I was--
I was running and I slipped
on a rock or something,

03:16.633 --> 03:20.967
and... I-- I ran into a fence.

03:21.067 --> 03:24.800
But, hey, um,
people will tell you,
hey, I wasn't running

03:24.833 --> 03:27.600
because I commit crimes.
I'm not wanted
for nothin', man.

03:27.633 --> 03:30.067
That's why I was like,
hey, I wasn't doin' nothin'.

03:30.100 --> 03:32.067
I mean, I was walking.
-Do you have warrants?

03:32.100 --> 03:34.067
-No.
-Okay, so you're walking
in the road,

03:34.067 --> 03:36.333
you don't have any warrants,
and you just sit and talk
to us, correct?

03:36.367 --> 03:38.633
-Yeah, but--
-Then you'll probably
be on your way, right?

03:38.667 --> 03:40.800
-Yeah.
-Not now.
Resisting arrest?

03:40.833 --> 03:44.833
-That's what I'm sayin',
like, I got-- I got, like,
mental health issues, eh?

03:44.867 --> 03:46.567
You guys came at me
all crazy like.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.967
-We came at you all crazy?
All we did was step out
of the car and ask you

03:49.067 --> 03:50.533
to come over to us.

03:50.567 --> 03:51.967
-What happened?

03:52.067 --> 03:54.667
-Saw this guy walkin'
down the street.
Uh, he was in the middle

03:54.700 --> 03:57.200
of the roadway on 53rd.

03:57.233 --> 03:59.733
Kind of looked like
he was yellin' at somebody.

03:59.767 --> 04:02.500
As soon as we came up on him,
he just started runnin'.

04:02.533 --> 04:05.333
He came runnin' through here,
came back this way.

04:05.367 --> 04:07.300
Jeff hit him with his Taser.
-Okay.

04:07.333 --> 04:09.467
-Um, noneffective
with the Taser.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.133
-Uh, he continued to run.
-Wow.

04:11.167 --> 04:14.900
Fire was actually headin'
back to the station
at that time, saw us.

04:14.933 --> 04:16.800
They jumped out,
and they helped us
detain him.

04:16.833 --> 04:21.333
According to someone
in patrol, uh, Mom is
at the end of the street here

04:21.367 --> 04:24.533
at 53rd.
Says that she's got
an order of protection

04:24.567 --> 04:27.467
against him.
Uh, he ran into her house.

04:27.500 --> 04:30.067
So, if I had to guess,
he probably knows
he's in violation

04:30.067 --> 04:31.433
of his court order.

04:31.467 --> 04:35.133
So we've got--
Some open blades fell
out of his pockets

04:35.167 --> 04:38.433
when we were wrestlin'
with him, so we probably
got prohibited possessor

04:38.467 --> 04:41.200
on him at that point in time.
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

04:41.233 --> 04:42.933
-We've got 'em over here.

04:42.967 --> 04:45.267
-Yeah, the one right there,
the one that's right through
the regular line--

04:45.300 --> 04:48.333
-Let me see these real quick.
-I found that by that
basketball court.

04:48.367 --> 04:50.700
-What is the point of having
this one?

04:50.733 --> 04:53.633
-So I can sell it--
-Be honest with me.
You're a convicted felon.

04:53.667 --> 04:56.067
That's not a pocket knife.
-Because I found it,
and I was, like, aw,

04:56.067 --> 04:58.367
this type right here,
I bet I can get five,
10 bucks for it.

04:58.400 --> 05:01.933
-What happened earlier today?
How come people are saying
you were at your mom's house?

05:01.967 --> 05:04.200
-Because they always say,
every time I walk in the road,

05:04.233 --> 05:06.333
they're like, he's not even
supposed to be walkin'
down the road,

05:06.367 --> 05:07.500
he's violating
a restraining order.

05:07.533 --> 05:10.467
And I was tellin' that girl,
I was, like, hey,

05:10.500 --> 05:13.067
see what happens?
There's nothin'
in the restrainin' order

05:13.067 --> 05:15.233
says I cannot walk
down this road,
know what I mean?

05:15.267 --> 05:18.100
And the thing is, um,
hey, I don't walk on her side
of the sidewalk.

05:18.133 --> 05:20.400
I don't even look over there
'cause I know how the people
are, eh?

05:20.433 --> 05:22.167
I tried to look the right way,
man, that's me.

05:22.200 --> 05:24.333
I'm sorry about that.
I apologize and stuff.

05:24.367 --> 05:26.800
-I accept your apology.
-All right.

05:26.833 --> 05:29.067
-Where's the probes at?
-I think you got
the worst end of it.

05:29.100 --> 05:31.867
-Let's get the probes
out of him.
-They're all out, sir.

05:31.900 --> 05:35.833
-No, they're not.
Little bit of a pinch, okay?
-Oh. All right.

05:35.867 --> 05:39.400
I think we're gonna go
try and talk to the mom.

05:39.433 --> 05:42.667
-Woman: Who is it?
-It's Officer Lindsey
with Glendale Police.

05:46.733 --> 05:48.233
We doin' okay, ma'am?
-Yeah.

05:48.267 --> 05:50.233
-This is kind of a shakeup
for you, isn't it?

05:50.267 --> 05:53.500
-Mm.
-What's goin' on between--
What's goin' on with Patrick?

05:53.533 --> 05:56.367
-Well, he's not allowed
to come back here
because of what he did

05:56.400 --> 05:58.700
to my house
when I was in California.

05:58.733 --> 06:02.967
And, um... he just comes back
all the time.

06:03.067 --> 06:05.367
He don't care
about the petition
or nothing.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.433
-How long have you had
the petition on him for?

06:07.467 --> 06:11.567
-Um, it's been
about two weeks, I think.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.933
-Okay.
-The last time
that he got out of jail.

06:13.967 --> 06:16.200
-What did you
get the petition for?

06:16.233 --> 06:21.300
-For no trespassing
or, um, to come back
and harass me or harm me.

06:21.333 --> 06:24.367
-Okay.
So he's done some harm to you
in the past before?

06:24.400 --> 06:26.267
Is that why--
-Not this time.

06:26.300 --> 06:28.300
-But in the past?
-In the past, a long time ago.

06:28.333 --> 06:30.767
-Okay.
Sounds like he's got
a past record, is that correct?

06:30.800 --> 06:35.167
-Oh-- (laughs) Yeah.
-Is he usin' drugs again,
do you think?

06:35.200 --> 06:37.833
What is he usin'?
-He's probably doing meth.

06:37.867 --> 06:39.867
-He's doing meth.
Is that what his drug
before was?

06:39.900 --> 06:43.067
-Oh, yeah, that--
Before he used
to do black.

06:43.067 --> 06:45.633
-Okay.
-But he's probably
doing meth now.

06:45.667 --> 06:48.633
-Okay.
-He has to go to a clinic
or something, he needs help.

06:48.667 --> 06:51.833
-Yeah.
If we can get him off the drugs,
I think that'll help him out

06:51.867 --> 06:53.833
a lot, because I think
it's the drugs talkin'.

06:53.867 --> 06:56.367
For your peace of mind,
he'll be in tonight, okay?

06:56.400 --> 06:58.400
We'll do what we can to try
and get him the proper help,

06:58.433 --> 07:00.500
so he can come back
into society and--

07:00.533 --> 07:02.500
-He's gotta clean up.
-Yeah.

07:05.100 --> 07:08.633
-I became a cop because,
you know, thinkin' as I was
growin' up, wantin' to do

07:08.667 --> 07:11.500
somethin' that I was good at,
somethin' I felt like I was
built for.

07:11.533 --> 07:13.467
And all my skills kinda line up
with this.

07:13.500 --> 07:16.500
I like problem-solving.
I like things
that are fast-paced.

07:16.533 --> 07:20.433
Of course, everybody likes
that adrenaline rush,
but in general it's nice

07:20.467 --> 07:24.100
just to, uh, solve problems
and not sit behind a desk.

07:25.967 --> 07:27.667
So we're goin'
to an armed robbery.

07:27.700 --> 07:31.567
A 13-year-old boy
had his bike taken
at knifepoint.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.933
-(radio chatter)

07:36.067 --> 07:38.433
-What's goin' on?
-So we're-- They don't know.

07:38.467 --> 07:41.067
This is probably like
the second time
this happened right here.

07:41.100 --> 07:44.400
-Okay.
-'Cause I had mine stolen
a while back.

07:44.433 --> 07:48.467
They-- There was a dude--
I don't know if you have
the description already.

07:48.500 --> 07:53.767
But he's sittin' there,
and I pull up, get on
this side of the building...

07:53.800 --> 07:57.167
-Okay...
-...and once I go in,
I'm barely in line, sit there

07:57.200 --> 07:59.133
for 20 seconds,
and I see the dude start
to walk up,

07:59.167 --> 08:00.400
get on it, just took off.

08:00.433 --> 08:02.633
He went behind Fry's
and came around this way.

08:02.667 --> 08:04.233
-Okay.
Did he point the knife
at you at all?

08:04.267 --> 08:06.900
-No, he brought it out,
that's it. Slipped back and--

08:06.933 --> 08:09.067
So he got on your bike,
and that's

08:09.067 --> 08:10.633
when you went out?
-Yeah, that's when
I went out,

08:10.667 --> 08:12.633
and he just went this way
and around and went
that way.

08:12.667 --> 08:14.067
-Okay.
-So...

08:14.067 --> 08:16.167
-So did you say something
to him or why did he say--

08:16.200 --> 08:17.567
-No, I just said, "Hey,
stop! Stop! Stop!"

08:17.600 --> 08:19.433
-As he was ridin' away?
-Yeah.

08:19.467 --> 08:20.800
Uh, he said it, too.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.967
-So at what point--
-I chased after him
on my skateboard,

08:23.067 --> 08:25.633
but he was going really fast.
-Okay, sounds like
they got your bike

08:25.667 --> 08:27.567
down the street.
What we're gonna do
is I'm gonna have you

08:27.600 --> 08:29.733
ride with me in my car, okay?
We're gonna head over there,

08:29.767 --> 08:31.867
and then you're just gonna
tell me if it's him or not,
all right?

08:31.900 --> 08:33.067
-All right.
-Sound good?

08:33.100 --> 08:34.600
Go and head over here.

08:34.633 --> 08:36.200
You think you could ID him
if you saw him again?

08:36.233 --> 08:38.600
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

08:38.633 --> 08:40.833
-Push the-- Just go
and push this bag over here.

08:40.867 --> 08:42.533
And hop in there.

08:42.567 --> 08:45.267
Just hang out right here.
We're gonna come back, okay?

08:46.300 --> 08:47.533
Thank you.

08:52.667 --> 08:55.733
So while you're running
after him, that's when
he kinda pulls out the knife

08:55.767 --> 08:57.567
and says--
-No, right as-- He was
pulling something

08:57.600 --> 08:59.067
out his pocket.

08:59.100 --> 09:01.400
Couldn't say if it
was a gun or anything.

09:01.433 --> 09:03.100
-Okay.
You never actually
saw a knife, though?

09:03.133 --> 09:04.267
-No.

09:04.300 --> 09:06.733
-Can you see from here?
-Yes, sir, that's him.

09:06.767 --> 09:08.600
-It's the same thing
on his head, same jacket.

09:08.633 --> 09:11.233
-Well, let's look at his--
-Same jeans, same
wallet chain and everything.

09:11.267 --> 09:12.933
-Okay, do you recognize
his face?
-Yes.

09:12.967 --> 09:15.300
-That's the same guy?
-Same beard,
same everything.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.200
-Okay.
-I mean,
the same mustache, yeah.

09:25.467 --> 09:27.100
-What's goin' on, dude?

09:28.933 --> 09:31.067
-So, how did you find him?

09:31.067 --> 09:34.767
-I was comin' south
on 47th, he's sittin'
right there,

09:34.800 --> 09:37.733
the northeast corner,
he's sittin' to hit
the crosswalk,

09:37.767 --> 09:41.767
to ride across.
Matched the description
to a tee, so,

09:41.800 --> 09:45.233
went out and addressed him
and then, Dulaney was
over there, he helped me

09:45.267 --> 09:46.267
take him into custody.

09:46.300 --> 09:48.167
-Did he have a knife on him?
-No.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.600
-No knife?
-No knife.

09:49.633 --> 09:53.667
He sayin' he never had a knife.
He's actually sayin', uh,

09:53.700 --> 09:56.500
that it was given to him,
the bike was given to him,

09:56.533 --> 09:58.133
and not stolen, so...
-Okay.

09:58.167 --> 10:00.100
Okay.
-All right.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.000
-Thanks for your help.
-Anytime, brother.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.700
-I really appreciate
what you guys do.

10:05.733 --> 10:08.467
-Well, thank you.
-Glad you guys caught him.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.700
-So we're gonna talk
to the suspect.

10:10.733 --> 10:12.233
See if we can get an interview.

10:12.267 --> 10:14.567
He may or may not talk to us.

10:17.967 --> 10:19.767
-Here he is.
-What's his name?

10:19.800 --> 10:22.067
-Uh, Valentino.

10:22.100 --> 10:26.733
Valentino.
What's goin' on today,
my man?

10:26.767 --> 10:30.233
-Well, I didn't steal
no (bleep) car! I didn't
steal none of that (bleep)!

10:30.267 --> 10:31.900
-Okay.
Who's bike were you ridin'?

10:31.933 --> 10:34.033
-Max's.
-Did he give you his bike?

10:34.067 --> 10:35.433
-Yeah!
-Okay.

10:35.467 --> 10:37.333
I don't know who Max is.
-Now he's saying
that it's stolen.

10:37.367 --> 10:39.733
Now you guys are gonna
take me to jail.
I already know the routine.

10:39.767 --> 10:42.467
Just like if my girl
says I hit her, you're gonna
(bleep) take me to jail,

10:42.500 --> 10:45.333
and no questions asked.
-Where did Max give you
the bike at?

10:45.367 --> 10:48.300
-Without checkin'
no cameras, you gonna
do that (bleep).

10:48.333 --> 10:50.367
Without checking nothing,
no evidence.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.267
-Do you have a camera
that you videotaped
the whole thing?

10:52.300 --> 10:53.567
-Hell, yeah!
-Where?

10:53.600 --> 10:56.400
-At the-- At the Panda Express.
Go look at the cameras!

10:56.433 --> 10:57.433
-They don't have cameras.

10:57.467 --> 10:58.800
-Now, so I'm arrested.

10:58.833 --> 11:02.567
Now it's his word against mine.
I know the routine.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.467
There's no use to bein'
right here. You're good.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.067
All right?
-Okay.

11:06.067 --> 11:07.733
-But--
-Where did Max
give you the bike at?

11:07.767 --> 11:09.400
-Right there
when I asked him for two bucks!

11:09.433 --> 11:11.533
-Right where,
can you tell me where?
-He said, "I have this bike,

11:11.567 --> 11:13.567
you can have this bike."
Right there, in front
of the (bleep),

11:13.600 --> 11:16.567
where we get out,
when they're getting out
of the Panda Express.

11:16.600 --> 11:19.167
-Okay.
-At the door where
there's-- where--

11:19.200 --> 11:21.667
where they're going out,
is where I was standing,

11:21.700 --> 11:24.600
and I asked him
if he had a couple bucks
so I could get somethin' to eat.

11:24.633 --> 11:28.600
He said, "All I got is
this bike. You want this bike?
I'm gonna put it right here."

11:28.633 --> 11:31.600
-That's what he said?
-He told me that.
Look in the camera.

11:31.633 --> 11:33.467
-He gave it to you for free?
-It's in that (bleep).

11:33.500 --> 11:36.333
-Okay. You didn't give
him any money?
He just gave you his bike?

11:36.367 --> 11:38.200
-I didn't give him no money,
I didn't give him no money.

11:38.233 --> 11:40.167
-Okay.
-Yeah, where's he at?

11:40.200 --> 11:42.367
-Is that normal,
that people just hand
someone else their bike

11:42.400 --> 11:44.067
for nothin'?
-It's not normal.

11:44.067 --> 11:46.600
-I agree.
Did you ever point
a knife at anybody?

11:46.633 --> 11:48.267
-Nah!
-Okay.

11:48.300 --> 11:49.600
Did you pull a knife
out of your pocket?

11:49.633 --> 11:52.133
-No!
-Did you say anything
like, "Back away from me"?

11:52.167 --> 11:54.700
-That's what I'm saying, bro,
he's lying.
-Okay.

11:54.733 --> 11:56.533
-Check the cameras!

11:56.567 --> 11:58.900
-Here's the deal.
You're gonna go to jail today
for stealin' someone's bike.

11:58.933 --> 12:01.467
Do you understand?
-Yeah, I understand. I already
know what you're gonna do.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.133
-Your charges are for theft.

12:03.167 --> 12:06.233
-Yeah, I already know that.
-Sounds good.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.067
-Hey--
-Don't-- Do not kick
the door open.

12:08.100 --> 12:09.533
-Are you gonna
check the cameras?

12:09.567 --> 12:11.567
-I told you about that!
I told you about that!

12:11.600 --> 12:13.067
-I'm gonna-- No!

12:13.067 --> 12:14.600
Aw! (mutters)

12:14.633 --> 12:16.067
-(radio chatter)

12:16.067 --> 12:18.267
-I don't have nothing.
(bleep) beat me up
for no reason!

12:18.300 --> 12:20.400
Mother (bleep),
you didn't even check
the cameras.

12:20.433 --> 12:23.067
-You just listen
to a little white boy,
'cause you're a white boy, too.

12:23.100 --> 12:25.200
-Sounds good.
Have a good day.
-Yeah, you know what it is.

12:25.233 --> 12:27.067
Little bitch.
You know what it is.

12:27.067 --> 12:28.467
Little (bleep) ho.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.367
-So, we don't really
have an armed robbery.

12:30.400 --> 12:31.867
We have a theft.
-Okay.

12:31.900 --> 12:33.667
-Uh, they never saw anything.
We don't--

12:33.700 --> 12:35.200
You guys didn't
have a knife on him at all?

12:35.233 --> 12:36.967
-He didn't have
any knife on him.
-Okay.

12:37.067 --> 12:38.500
The victim
couldn't articulate anything

12:38.533 --> 12:39.967
other than he said,
"Back away from me"?

12:40.067 --> 12:41.467
-Okay.
-He said he saw him
reach for something

12:41.500 --> 12:43.767
in his pocket,
but he didn't know
exactly what it was?

12:43.800 --> 12:46.800
-Okay.
-And he didn't point anything
at him, so, we're just gonna

12:46.833 --> 12:47.833
go for theft.

12:47.867 --> 12:49.300
-Okay.
-Sound good?

12:50.767 --> 12:53.100
All right, we gotta talk
a little bit more, okay?

13:01.900 --> 13:03.867
All right, come on out.

13:03.900 --> 13:06.267
So we're gonna have an officer
bring your bike back over here.
-Okay.

13:06.300 --> 13:09.267
-What we'll do is, uh,
we might have someone
give you a ride home.

13:09.300 --> 13:11.200
-All right.
-We're gonna get you
a report number, okay?

13:11.233 --> 13:12.900
-Okay.
-Do you wanna press charges
against this guy?

13:12.933 --> 13:15.200
-Yes, I do. Yes, sir.
-Have him go to jail?
Perfect. Okay.

13:15.233 --> 13:16.967
So he's gonna
go to jail today,

13:17.067 --> 13:19.433
and, uh, we'll make sure
we notify your parents
of everything that's happened.

13:19.467 --> 13:21.200
We'll get your bike back, okay?
-All right. Yes, sir.

13:21.233 --> 13:23.533
-Next time, let's get
a bike lock, though.
-All right. Yes, sir.

13:23.567 --> 13:25.133
-That'll stop
a little bit, at least.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.933
-Growin' up, my parents
did the best they could
to provide for me,

13:29.967 --> 13:32.067
but I didn't really have a lot.

13:32.100 --> 13:34.467
When I got out on my own,
I was really down and out

13:34.500 --> 13:36.367
on my luck,
livin' out of my truck.

13:36.400 --> 13:39.267
I had to dig myself out of
the hole that I put myself into,

13:39.300 --> 13:42.367
and I feel like,
because of the things
that I went through

13:42.400 --> 13:45.467
and struggled for,
I understand what people
are going through

13:45.500 --> 13:46.867
a bit better.

13:46.900 --> 13:49.267
-(radio chatter)
-Uh, right now we're going
to an in-progress

13:49.300 --> 13:50.867
domestic violence call.

13:50.900 --> 13:52.400
We've got a female,
who's out of breath,

13:52.433 --> 13:54.533
screamin' on the line,
yellin' that a male

13:54.567 --> 13:56.900
is, uh, possibly
beatin' her, so...

14:03.067 --> 14:06.267
Seven William, 34.
We got an open door.
Gonna be making contact.

14:08.167 --> 14:10.633
-Man: Yeah?
-Metro Police.

14:10.667 --> 14:14.433
-Yeah, good.
Get this little broad out.
She's up here stealin'.

14:14.467 --> 14:18.967
She stole... stole my-- Yeah.
-Here, come on out for me.
Come on out.

14:19.067 --> 14:21.367
-Stole my--
-Can you set your phone
down for me?

14:21.400 --> 14:23.933
Seven William, 34.
You can, uh, clear the red.
Code four.

14:23.967 --> 14:26.433
-She up there stealin' (bleep).
Steal my remote--

14:26.467 --> 14:27.967
-Have a seat.
-Yeah.

14:28.067 --> 14:29.633
Steal speakers and every
damn thing that she gets!

14:29.667 --> 14:32.400
-Who is she that
you're talkin' about?
Is this your wife, girlfriend?

14:32.433 --> 14:36.267
-Hell, no. Some girl
I've been tryin' to help.
Her name's Olivia.

14:36.300 --> 14:38.867
She ran around there
to 32, I think.

14:38.900 --> 14:41.700
Uh, dumped the load
to think that she ain't
got nothin'.

14:41.733 --> 14:43.233
Probably leavin' stuff
in their place.

14:43.267 --> 14:44.867
-What do you mean
dumped a load?
What has she got?

14:44.900 --> 14:47.133
-She got my-- my remotes...
-Okay.

14:47.167 --> 14:50.900
-Uh, parts of my, uh... stereo--

14:50.933 --> 14:53.300
I mean, not stereo,
but computer and (bleep)
like that.

14:53.333 --> 14:54.833
-Okay. So what happened tonight?

14:54.867 --> 14:57.300
-I caught her, she was up there,
she was loadin' some of my stuff

14:57.333 --> 14:59.233
up in my--
in her bags and stuff.

14:59.267 --> 15:03.067
I asked her, where's my damn
remote she took, and everything.
-Okay.

15:03.067 --> 15:06.200
-She loaded all that up
in her bags and ran,
runnin' out the door with 'em.

15:06.233 --> 15:08.300
-Down at 32?
-So she didn't actually
put hands on you?

15:08.333 --> 15:10.500
-She was kickin' me and (bleep).
-Where was she kickin' you at?

15:10.533 --> 15:13.100
-All in the groin,
stomach area, lower part.

15:13.133 --> 15:15.400
I snatcher her wig
off her head.

15:15.433 --> 15:18.133
-All right.
Hang tight for us
for just a second, okay?

15:18.167 --> 15:20.733
He's sayin' that
she came down here to 32,

15:20.767 --> 15:22.567
and so we'll see if we can get
her side of the story.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.067
-Are you Olivia?
-Yeah.

15:24.067 --> 15:25.833
-How you doin'?
Come on over and talk
to me for a minute.

15:25.867 --> 15:28.400
-Okay.
-You got anything
sharp on you?

15:28.433 --> 15:30.433
-Uh, I got
a hand knife in here.

15:30.467 --> 15:31.933
-Okay, you set your bag
down for me?

15:31.967 --> 15:34.200
Come here.
Olivia, come here.

15:34.233 --> 15:35.800
-Last time
he whipped my ass,

15:35.833 --> 15:37.300
I was the one
who got in trouble.

15:37.333 --> 15:40.133
It's not right.
I did not hit him back,
God's honest truth.

15:40.167 --> 15:43.867
He started an argument
over where's the remote.
I'm walkin' down the stairs.

15:43.900 --> 15:47.367
As I'm goin' down the stairs,
he dinged me on the side
of the head, right here,

15:47.400 --> 15:49.333
in the back.
-So he actually punched you
or did he slap you?

15:49.367 --> 15:51.867
-Oh, he socked me in the head,
in the back of the head.

15:51.900 --> 15:54.100
-Is that when you
struck him back, when you
kicked him in the groin?

15:54.133 --> 15:56.200
-I didn't kick him.
He knocked me down the stairs.

15:56.233 --> 15:58.100
He hit me in the head so hard,
I slipped down the stairs,

15:58.133 --> 15:59.700
and when I was
on the bottom of the stairs,

15:59.733 --> 16:02.700
he started tryin' to choke me,
and was on top of me,
kickin' me.

16:03.900 --> 16:05.367
-Where else
was he kickin' you at?

16:05.400 --> 16:08.533
-All over.
-You realize he's like
three times your age.

16:08.567 --> 16:11.133
-Yeah, he's
a strong old (bleep).
-The way you're makin' it

16:11.167 --> 16:14.133
sound is like,
he worked you over
like you just went 12 rounds

16:14.167 --> 16:15.167
with Mike Tyson.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.133
-No, he knocked me--
He coldcocked me.

16:17.167 --> 16:19.367
He blindsided me.
That wasn't even
a fair fight.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.067
-How old are you?
-Thirty-three.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.567
-And how old is he?
-Sixties.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.233
-What's your
relationship to him?

16:25.267 --> 16:27.433
A dating relationship
or just roommates?

16:29.700 --> 16:31.067
-He wants to have sex
with me so bad,

16:31.100 --> 16:33.700
and every time I tell him no,
he gets worse mad at me.

16:33.733 --> 16:38.333
And it's like, um...
"I'd rather go (bleep) a trick
than you, sittin' here,

16:38.367 --> 16:40.100
"I pay the (bleep), don't I?

16:40.133 --> 16:42.767
"I pay my part of the rent,
and leave me the (bleep) alone
about the cutty,

16:42.800 --> 16:44.333
'cause you're not gettin' none,"
I'll tell him.

16:44.367 --> 16:46.800
Then he'll get mad,
'cause he is kinda like
psychopathic.

16:46.833 --> 16:49.633
He's cuckoo. You know,
over the cuckoo's nest.

16:49.667 --> 16:52.600
-You don't show any
visible marks. I don't see
any marks on your legs--

16:52.633 --> 16:55.600
-I wouldn't call the police
to be tryin' to tell you guys
I hit him back.

16:55.633 --> 16:59.233
-I'm just askin'.
-I know the law, Murphy's Law.
You do not hit somebody back

16:59.267 --> 17:01.933
if you're
calling the police on him.
-That's called Murphy's Law?

17:01.967 --> 17:04.567
-That's common sense.
-That's called Murphy's Law?

17:04.600 --> 17:06.067
-The last time I went to jail
for that.

17:06.067 --> 17:07.700
I think I know better
this time.

17:07.733 --> 17:09.933
I wouldn't call you guys
out here if I didn't
need your help.

17:09.967 --> 17:11.367
You know what I mean?

17:11.400 --> 17:12.767
-Okay.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.900
All right.
Do me a favor, Olivia,
have a seat

17:14.933 --> 17:17.067
for a second.
Have a seat.

17:18.867 --> 17:21.333
Hang tight for us
for just a second, okay?

17:21.367 --> 17:23.800
She's claimin' that she got
worked over pretty good.

17:23.833 --> 17:25.833
I don't know
what her relationship is.
-Okay.

17:25.867 --> 17:28.500
-Let's go back, see if
we can lock down exactly
who he is.

17:28.533 --> 17:32.300
-Okay.
I'll go see if I can locate
that ID, and see

17:32.333 --> 17:34.233
if I can get another story
from him.

17:34.267 --> 17:37.600
-He's sayin' that she hit him.
She kicked him in the groin
a few times.

17:37.633 --> 17:42.467
-Mm.
-Again, I didn't see
any marks.

17:42.500 --> 17:45.833
So, we'll have to do
a little further digging,
see if we can, uh,

17:45.867 --> 17:47.667
get a little better story
out of the two of them.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.067
-Yeah. Okay.
-Cool.

17:49.067 --> 17:51.300
-Sounds good.
-All right.

17:51.333 --> 17:56.067
-Every time I call 9-1-1,
it gives me a sick feeling
inside my stomach

17:56.100 --> 17:59.433
even havin' to,
you know, ask somebody
to come help me for any reason.

17:59.467 --> 18:01.333
-Well, we're here.
We're tryin' to help.

18:01.367 --> 18:03.900
We're tryin' to get this
solved so that you can
be on your way.

18:03.933 --> 18:06.967
The last thing I want
is for you goin' back
down there.

18:07.067 --> 18:09.633
The problem is, is we've
been there several times.

18:09.667 --> 18:11.300
-Not for me!

18:11.333 --> 18:15.200
The last three days
I just told him, bottom line,
hey, if we go past this

18:15.233 --> 18:18.633
here bein' a friendship,
then it won't be the same
no more

18:18.667 --> 18:22.267
and we'll lose
our friendship, so I think
I'd rather just keep it

18:22.300 --> 18:23.700
like this anyway,
and ever since then...

18:23.733 --> 18:25.533
well, the other day
he woke up--
-And what did he say

18:25.567 --> 18:28.067
when you told him that?
-He said, "You won't
give it to me, I'll take it,"

18:28.067 --> 18:29.633
and he jumped on top
of me and tried to take it.

18:29.667 --> 18:33.467
I finally pushed him off.
And then he'll bring
a new girl home.

18:33.500 --> 18:36.667
If the girls give him sex,
then he'll help 'em.
If they don't give him sex,

18:36.700 --> 18:37.933
then they gotta
get the (bleep) out.

18:37.967 --> 18:39.667
He knows I'm not
gonna give him sex.

18:39.700 --> 18:41.667
He looks at me
like a piece of candy,

18:41.700 --> 18:44.433
and when he doesn't
get his way, he starts
getting like, you know...

18:44.467 --> 18:45.800
-Okay.
-All...

18:45.833 --> 18:47.433
-All right. Well, give us
a couple minutes.

18:47.467 --> 18:49.200
We'll try to get you
out of here. Okay?

18:52.200 --> 18:55.133
Melvin...
-What is it now?

18:55.167 --> 18:59.067
I wanna know what the hell
is going on because I just said
I ain't done a goddamn thing.

18:59.067 --> 19:00.600
-Melvin...
-What?

19:00.633 --> 19:02.733
-You had a warrant
that was issued on the 12th
for domestic violence.

19:02.767 --> 19:05.067
You want me to explain
what's going on, right?
-Yes! I want to know!

19:05.067 --> 19:07.833
-Okay, you're also gonna
go to jail for new PC charges
for domestic violence.

19:07.867 --> 19:11.133
-Look, I was tryin' to help her
get on her feet, that was all.

19:11.167 --> 19:14.067
And then she started
flirtin' around,
I got tired of it.

19:14.100 --> 19:16.533
I told her she had to go.
-It's my understanding
that you said

19:16.567 --> 19:18.333
that you grabbed her by the back
of the head tonight--

19:18.367 --> 19:21.733
-I grabbed that wig off.
-But that's what caused her
to fall down the stairs.

19:21.767 --> 19:23.933
-No, she was going down
stairs tryin' to run,

19:23.967 --> 19:27.567
'cause she grabbed
a lotta my (bleep)
in that purse back there.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.967
-And you grabbed her?
-Uh, reached for her.
I grabbed her wig.

19:31.067 --> 19:34.200
She stumbled down the steps,
and then she started
kickin' me in the groin

19:34.233 --> 19:35.233
and the stomach
and all that.

19:35.267 --> 19:36.767
If I'd hit her,
I would've hit her.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.433
-All right.
-But I didn't.

19:38.467 --> 19:40.400
-Well, we'll lock
your apartment up
for you, okay?

19:40.433 --> 19:41.900
-Left my pills there.
-Good luck to you.

19:41.933 --> 19:43.600
-I don't want
that bitch up in there.

19:43.633 --> 19:45.600
He's gonna be in there
for at least 12 hours.

19:45.633 --> 19:48.533
Unfortunately for her,
he's set in his ways,
he's not gonna change.

19:49.567 --> 19:51.733
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:51.767 --> 19:53.700
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:53.733 --> 19:54.867
Cover is code three.

19:54.900 --> 19:57.867
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.400 --> 20:06.367
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:06.400 --> 20:11.933
-(theme music playing)
