01:10.805 --> 01:12.438
Oh, this is nice.

01:15.342 --> 01:16.442
This is nice.

01:19.380 --> 01:20.746
Acres and acres, Kate.

01:22.683 --> 01:25.484
Acres and acres, my darlin'.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.102
- What are you doing?
- Kissing you.

01:43.104 --> 01:44.570
- You just did.
- Yeah.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.605
- And then you kissed me again.
- Well spotted.

01:47.141 --> 01:49.641
- Did you kiss me again?
- Yeah. - No, you didn't.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.510
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't. - Yes, I did.

01:51.512 --> 01:52.778
- I kissed you twice, I promise.
- No, you didn't.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.247
- No, you didn't.
- Come here.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.330
Daddy?

02:18.372 --> 02:20.539
Come up here, come sit with me.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.775
There you go, that's it.

02:24.845 --> 02:27.279
My other beautiful
little boy, come on.

02:34.655 --> 02:39.224
Boys, remember yesterday,
when you both gave

02:39.226 --> 02:41.360
your mommy
a massive cuddle in bed?

02:41.362 --> 02:43.362
And she was so poorly,
wasn't she?

02:43.364 --> 02:44.730
You know,
she couldn't fight anymore.

02:49.436 --> 02:51.270
Has mommy gone to heaven?

02:52.540 --> 02:54.406
Yes, darling, yeah.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.576
So, she's in a cloud?

02:58.712 --> 03:01.346
Um, yeah, you can imagine her

03:02.316 --> 03:03.882
sitting on a cloud, if you like.

03:06.187 --> 03:07.553
What are we gonna do now?

03:08.556 --> 03:12.658
Um, well,
we'll just go on, mate.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.361
Has all mom's stuff gone?

03:16.363 --> 03:18.830
Oh, no, no.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.934
Of course not,
no, not a bit of it.

03:21.936 --> 03:23.468
Mommy just blew us a kiss.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.344
Look at those trails.

03:32.346 --> 03:34.246
It's like they've blown a kiss.

03:34.248 --> 03:35.647
How is it like a kiss?

03:36.717 --> 03:41.253
Well, because

03:51.465 --> 03:52.331
I like that.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.265
Me, too.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.916
It's all sunny now, look.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.052
Got everything?

04:47.054 --> 04:48.754
What's all that?

04:48.756 --> 04:50.455
What?

04:50.457 --> 04:51.390
Oh, yeah.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.727
Let's have a look.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.897
It's from John and Leslie,
in number 12.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.065
That's nice, isn't it?

05:00.067 --> 05:01.533
There's a card.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.769
- But what are they?
- It's food parcels.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.570
- I'm not hungry.
- No, I'm not hungry either,

05:05.572 --> 05:07.873
but when-- when we are

05:07.875 --> 05:10.475
all the hard work's
been done, hasn't it?

05:10.477 --> 05:11.843
It's nice of people.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.947
- Do you want to go inside?
- Yeah.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.932
Get those coats off.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.537
Don't forget them things,
don't forget them.

05:45.612 --> 05:46.545
Let's see it.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.481
So what we'll do,

05:49.483 --> 05:51.817
if you, uh
go and get changed, yeah

05:51.819 --> 05:54.686
and-- and then we can
watch a bit of telly.

05:55.622 --> 05:58.824
And then we'll have
a bit of dinner and...

06:30.891 --> 06:33.125
Reef said she's
never coming back.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.498
You know I want
to see her again.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.769
I do, desperately.

06:45.172 --> 06:48.573
But it doesn't mean she's not
here, come here, come here.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.576
It doesn't mean
she's not here, it's okay.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.612
You know, she's still here.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.115
In your mind, eh?

06:57.885 --> 06:59.684
And in your memories

07:00.654 --> 07:01.653
and in your heart.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.497
- Tired, lads?
- Yeah.

07:12.499 --> 07:13.899
Yeah, you okay?

07:15.803 --> 07:17.135
- Do me a favor?
- Yeah.

07:17.137 --> 07:20.071
Will you, um, go upstairs
and run you both a bath?

07:20.073 --> 07:23.074
- Sure.
- Yeah, take your brother up with you.

07:23.076 --> 07:25.610
Fold these jumpers up and you can wear
them tomorrow 'cause they're not dirty.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.179
And then just make sure
you put your trousers

07:27.181 --> 07:28.947
in the washing basket, okay?

07:45.799 --> 07:47.833
Singe,
it's probably nothing,

07:47.835 --> 07:49.634
but I think I found a lump.

07:49.636 --> 07:50.969
Where?

07:50.971 --> 07:54.906
Here. I think, I don't know.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.909
It's probably nothing,
but will you see if you can--

07:57.911 --> 07:59.578
- Shall I have a feel?
- Yeah.

07:59.580 --> 08:00.979
Get your shirt off, girl.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.550
- Where, show me?
- There.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.853
- Oh, there.
- Yeah?

08:07.855 --> 08:09.054
- That thing there?
- Yeah.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.189
- Yeah, is it tender?
- A bit.

08:11.558 --> 08:13.258
It feels a bit hard,
you can feel something.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.560
- Like I said, but it's probably nothing.
- Yeah.

08:15.562 --> 08:16.828
- I'll get it checked.
- Should maybe get it checked

08:16.830 --> 08:17.829
just to be on the safe side, eh.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.798
- I'm sure it'll be fine.
- Yeah.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.933
- Actually, I could call now.
- Give them a call now.

08:21.935 --> 08:24.736
- What time is it? Yeah, they should still be open.
- I might call now. Okay.

08:35.249 --> 08:37.883
Yeah, hi, it's Kate Greene.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.284
I wondered if
I could make an appointment?

08:46.059 --> 08:48.894
Kate,
we found two cancers,

08:48.896 --> 08:51.897
both in the same breast,
and both grade three.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.934
Now, it looks as though
some of the lymph glands

08:55.936 --> 08:57.969
are involved
which makes it Stage two,

08:57.971 --> 09:00.238
but that's what we term common.

09:00.240 --> 09:03.174
That's actually
a really good sign, Kate.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.644
Because there's an
80 % chance of survival

09:05.646 --> 09:07.279
for the first 10 years.

09:07.281 --> 09:09.648
And those chances
improve all the time

09:09.650 --> 09:11.049
after that, year on year.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.651
Given the
diagnosis, that prognosis

09:12.653 --> 09:15.820
is about the best
that we could wish for.

09:15.822 --> 09:18.657
Nonetheless,
we want to get on top of it.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.592
We want to chase it out.

09:20.594 --> 09:22.227
So we're looking at a mastectomy

09:23.030 --> 09:25.931
and possible reconstruction
if that's what you want.

09:25.933 --> 09:30.235
We'd like to
book you in for that next week.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.570
It's likely
that we'll need

09:32.105 --> 09:33.572
to give you
chemotherapy treatment,

09:33.574 --> 09:35.674
but we'll discuss that
after surgery.

09:36.810 --> 09:39.210
Does all this
make sense so far, Kate?

09:43.584 --> 09:45.584
Not the worst news I've
ever heard, believe it or not.

09:45.586 --> 09:48.053
Our little boy had cancer,
you see. Um...

09:50.057 --> 09:53.959
He's just recovered-- He's recovered now.
- Great.

09:53.961 --> 09:58.096
- And he was given, uh, he was given a 6 % chance of survival.
- Wow.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.198
And now we just
celebrated his fifth birthday.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.000
In style.

10:02.002 --> 10:05.604
Good for him!
That's good for all of you.

10:14.715 --> 10:17.248
Didn't think this was how
I'd end up with bigger boobs.

10:38.905 --> 10:42.273
- What time is it?
- I haven't got my watch and my phone's dead, I don't know.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.891
Reef, you've got
to take your medicine.

11:05.399 --> 11:09.801
So, Mommy might be
taking medicine like this soon.

11:10.303 --> 11:11.236
Why?

11:11.238 --> 11:16.074
Because I had a lump found
just like you had a lump.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.009
Cancer?

11:18.011 --> 11:19.844
Yeah, cancer.

11:20.747 --> 11:23.448
But my lump's been
taken away just like Reef's was.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.684
And now I'm gonna
have the same medicines.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.285
They're disgusting.

11:27.287 --> 11:30.088
I know,
but they made you better

11:30.090 --> 11:32.023
just like they're
gonna make me better.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.191
I'll look after you, Mommy.

11:33.694 --> 11:37.696
- Sweetie, I know you will.
- Me, too.

11:37.998 --> 11:41.900
I know, sweetie, you both will,
my beautiful little men.

12:00.987 --> 12:01.920
Daddy?

12:04.324 --> 12:05.356
What are you doing?

12:09.963 --> 12:11.362
It smells like Mommy.

13:03.450 --> 13:08.853
Alright then.
- Wait, okay, we're each gonna find one, a four leaf clover.

13:08.855 --> 13:11.489
So spread out and look close.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.359
See, I've got these friends,
the field fairies

13:14.361 --> 13:17.929
and soon enough they'll see me
and they'll go, hey, it's Kate,

13:17.931 --> 13:21.533
- let's send her a four leaf clover like we always do.
- Fields don't have fairies.

13:21.535 --> 13:25.970
Then how come I keep finding four leaf clovers?
- Does a three count?

13:25.972 --> 13:29.107
- Daddy's been asking me that for the last 20 years.
- I happen to have a knack for

13:29.109 --> 13:31.075
- finding threes, it's not my fault.
That's not a knack,

13:31.077 --> 13:33.077
that's just lazy,
but you're welcome to keep them if you want.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.879
- I might just do that.
- I only want fours.

13:34.881 --> 13:36.881
Yeah, well, I might end up with
a bigger collection than you.

13:36.883 --> 13:38.449
- No doubt.
- How would that make you feel?

13:38.451 --> 13:40.952
- I feel absolutely nothing.
- Yeah, I know that, jealous.

13:40.954 --> 13:44.556
- They have no value whatsoever.
- My God, you are such a clover snob!

13:44.558 --> 13:47.458
Aren't you? Hey, look.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.560
Boys, help me!

13:48.562 --> 13:51.596
Here, here.

13:51.598 --> 13:54.966
Thanks, Christine
and thanks for coming over.

13:54.968 --> 13:55.834
Oh, yeah.

13:55.836 --> 13:56.568
Have a look.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.270
That's my girl.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.974
Reef's medicine, bless her.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.176
Alright, okay, um...

14:07.981 --> 14:10.248
Okay, Reef,
it's time for your medicine.

14:14.487 --> 14:18.323
So most people at school

14:18.325 --> 14:21.326
will know about what happened,
I mean, some might not.

14:21.328 --> 14:24.395
And some might
wanna talk to you about it.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.398
But, you know,
some people might not, again,

14:27.400 --> 14:30.235
but, uh, it's just very
important that you know

14:30.237 --> 14:33.538
that everyone loves you
and they care about you.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.174
Okay, and they're all your friends, alright?
- Okay.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.909
- Alright, okay?
- Okay.

14:37.911 --> 14:39.477
Good boys, love you.

14:59.900 --> 15:03.201
Okay. Come on, we'll go to
the office, have a little chat.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.185
Right.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.322
Let's get this
over and done with.

15:30.163 --> 15:33.665
So, the results show
a triple negative

15:33.667 --> 15:35.934
which means
you're not responsive

15:35.936 --> 15:38.169
to the more
common hormone treatments.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.570
Which means we do
need to move you

15:39.572 --> 15:42.040
to chemotherapy
and radiotherapy.

15:42.676 --> 15:46.110
But, given
the size of the tumor,

15:46.112 --> 15:49.147
the fact that the cancer
has only crept into one node,

15:49.149 --> 15:51.349
and the others
have been removed,

15:51.351 --> 15:53.051
that's extremely hopeful.

15:56.022 --> 15:58.690
I'm gonna handle it
just like we've handled it.

15:58.692 --> 16:00.558
I'm gonna beat it
just like he did.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.484
<i>¶ That's the look</i>
<i>That's the look ¶</i>

16:26.486 --> 16:28.319

16:28.321 --> 16:30.321

16:30.323 --> 16:31.289
<i>¶ The look of love ¶</i>

16:31.291 --> 16:33.391
- Hi!
- Hi!

16:33.393 --> 16:34.325
You alright?

16:34.327 --> 16:35.293
Yeah, you?

16:37.030 --> 16:38.129
I'm good.

16:38.130 --> 16:39.229
Uh, my friend's
hurt her wrist.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.365
Alright, first things first.

16:40.367 --> 16:41.632
- What's your name?
- Kate.

16:41.634 --> 16:44.068
- Kate. Friend's name?
- Rachel.

16:44.070 --> 16:46.137
- Rachel.
- I'm Singe.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.638
- What?
- Singe.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.274
- That's your name?
- Yeah, like Sinjun, Saint John.

16:50.276 --> 16:52.777
- Saint?
- Yeah, where'd you think I came up with Singe?

16:53.446 --> 16:57.448
Are you Rachel? You've gotta take it easy.
Can't put any weight on it.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.384
Don't push off on it or
anything like that, alright?

16:59.386 --> 17:01.152
- Okay, thanks.
- No probs.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.487
- Thanks, Singe.
- No problem.

17:02.489 --> 17:03.654
See you later, alright?

17:14.434 --> 17:16.367
Hey,
are you following me?

17:16.368 --> 17:18.736
- Depends.
- On what?

17:18.738 --> 17:21.372
- Are you working next weekend?
- I work every weekend.

17:21.374 --> 17:24.642
- It's my birthday on Friday.
- Yeah?

17:24.644 --> 17:26.210
You could wish
me a happy birthday.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.512
Happy birthday!

17:27.513 --> 17:28.613
I mean on Friday.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.348
- What?
- On Friday!

17:30.350 --> 17:32.817
- Yeah, alright.
- Maybe even a birthday kiss?

17:35.455 --> 17:37.588
- Do we have a problem?
- Nope.

17:37.590 --> 17:38.823
So, do we have a deal?

17:38.825 --> 17:39.757
Deal.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.428
What's this?

17:43.430 --> 17:44.462
Your lucky day.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.264
<i>¶ Love, sweet love ¶</i>

17:46.266 --> 17:50.701
<i>¶ I won't</i>
<i>Let another day pass by ¶</i>

17:50.703 --> 17:55.206
<i>¶ That would be</i>
<i>Too big a sacrifice ¶</i>

18:22.435 --> 18:25.303
- No!
- You were doing it a minute ago, just be sexy.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.605
- I can't just be sexy!
- Pretend Rachel's not here.

18:27.607 --> 18:30.608
- Oh, thank you very much! You take 'em.
- Really?

18:30.610 --> 18:32.143
I'm not gonna get
much out of her, am I?

18:32.145 --> 18:34.545
I will, alright,
come on, Kate, sexy.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.548
- No, wait, hold on.
- What?

18:37.550 --> 18:39.484
- This is not gonna help.
- Accessories!

18:41.387 --> 18:42.520
Ten years later.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.322
Okay, now try mysterious.

18:44.324 --> 18:45.823
Okay, mysterious.

18:49.863 --> 18:51.162
- Attitude!
- Attitude, try that.

18:51.164 --> 18:53.831
- Oh, I can do that.
- Alright.

18:55.502 --> 18:56.634
Oh, look.

18:56.636 --> 18:57.668
Yeah.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.505
Is this working for you?

19:04.410 --> 19:05.343
Yeah.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.521
I'll get back at work, shall I?

19:32.705 --> 19:34.772
<i>A poem is hard to write.</i>

19:34.774 --> 19:36.908
<i>The words never come out right.</i>

19:36.910 --> 19:39.710
<i>And once the rhyme is found,</i>
<i>no words with that sound</i>

19:39.712 --> 19:44.749
<i>spring to your mind to</i>
<i>express what you find in love.</i>

20:04.270 --> 20:05.903
You wanted me to
find this, didn't you?

20:08.408 --> 20:10.641
- Ouw!
- Careful of your mom, please.

20:10.643 --> 20:13.644
- Careful of your mom, please!
- Hang on, let me just get up.

20:13.646 --> 20:16.547
- Jump on, just be very careful around that area.
- Move to the side.

20:16.549 --> 20:17.815
- Thank you, oh!
- It's not wake up time yet.

20:17.817 --> 20:21.219
- It's not, what are you doing?
- That's the best

20:21.221 --> 20:23.521
- morning wake up ever.
- No raspberries in my face.

20:27.260 --> 20:30.394
Everything's okay with your blood so we're
just gonna get your chemo set up now.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.496
This is gonna feel a little odd.

20:32.498 --> 20:37.535
Um, you will have some odd sensations, uh,
hot flashes, things like that.

20:37.537 --> 20:40.338
It's nothing to worry about at all.
It's perfectly normal, but please,

20:40.340 --> 20:42.607
- let us know if there's anything you're not sure of.
- Okay.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.542
Can I ask you a crass question,
how long does that take?

20:44.544 --> 20:46.877
So this, it'll take
about five hours, so... Yeah.

20:46.879 --> 20:49.247
Five hours, by the arm.
- I hope you've got a soft cushion.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.682
I'll find her
a soft cushion.

20:55.955 --> 20:59.857
Okay. Let's get that running.

21:05.365 --> 21:07.565
You
feeling anything yet?

21:07.567 --> 21:08.699
Not yet.

21:12.572 --> 21:16.874
- Have we got food for tonight?
- Yeah, I've got dinner, let's do fish fingers and that.

21:16.876 --> 21:19.477
- Great.
- With some pasta or whatever.

21:19.479 --> 21:20.411
You hungry now?

21:21.881 --> 21:24.448
- You want something now, Monster Munch?
- Yeah.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.750
- Oh, it feels weird.
- Hula Hoops?

21:25.752 --> 21:27.318
- Feels weird now?
- Yeah.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.029
- Will you hold my hand?
- Yeah, of course, yeah.

21:42.435 --> 21:44.435
Can you get Hannah?

21:44.437 --> 21:46.737
Sorry, Hannah,
Hannah, excuse me?

21:46.739 --> 21:48.839
Thank you. She's got--

21:48.841 --> 21:50.841
- Everything okay?
- Feels like I need the loo.

21:50.843 --> 21:54.412
Okay, it's perfectly normal, just, um,
a reaction to the chemotherapy.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.347
You're not actually
gonna have an accident, okay.

21:56.349 --> 21:57.448
- It's fine, it's just--
- You sure?

21:57.450 --> 21:59.450
Yeah, honestly, it will start

21:59.452 --> 22:01.686
to settle down as it all
gets into your body.

22:01.688 --> 22:04.789
- But try and relax, okay?
- Alright, yeah, thanks.

22:04.791 --> 22:07.024
Alright, okay.

22:24.644 --> 22:26.510
We're gonna be
late if we don't hurry.

22:26.512 --> 22:27.878
I know,
we need to get a move on.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.948
- You want jam on it?
- Uh, no.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.717
That is a great photo!

22:32.719 --> 22:35.586
That is a brilliant one.
One more, one more.

22:35.588 --> 22:36.620
Those five...

22:39.092 --> 22:40.658
- Are you not gonna eat something?
- My beautiful boys.

22:40.660 --> 22:41.726
Yeah, I will.

22:49.035 --> 22:52.136
She had bank statements,
wills, the insurance policies,

22:52.138 --> 22:54.972
all of them were
all laid out, you know.

22:54.974 --> 22:58.642
Like, who to call when,
which policies to cash in

22:58.644 --> 23:00.511
and that sort of thing,
incredible.

23:00.513 --> 23:03.714
Let's face it, Singe, she always
was one step ahead of you.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.583
Yeah, you can say that again.
But the thing is though, Rach,

23:05.585 --> 23:07.385
you know,
like doing all that stuff

23:07.387 --> 23:09.720
and-- and getting it all sorted,
but knowing why

23:09.722 --> 23:12.590
you were getting it sorted, you know?
Do you know what I mean?

23:12.592 --> 23:17.094
- But-- but still doing it, still carrying on regardless.
- She made it her job.

23:17.096 --> 23:18.963
- Yeah.
- That's Kate all over.

23:18.965 --> 23:22.867
I know. Oh, yeah,
that's what I wanted to--

23:22.869 --> 23:25.035
I found these the other day
um, when I was up

23:25.037 --> 23:26.871
in the attic
having a root around.

23:29.142 --> 23:32.076
- Have a look.
- Oh, my god.

23:32.512 --> 23:35.813
- Oh, my god! I remember that, yeah!
- Do you remember these, yeah?

23:35.815 --> 23:37.915
You were as good
as shagging that day.

23:37.917 --> 23:41.752
Oh, stop it. Lovely.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.687
- She was so beautiful.
- I know.

23:43.689 --> 23:45.823
Like this is all the,
like memories and stuff.

23:45.825 --> 23:48.559
You know like this is the only
version I've got of her in it.

23:51.164 --> 23:53.864
Do you know what I mean?
Like, I'm not gonna make any new memories.

24:05.511 --> 24:07.111
On the morning she
died...

24:07.847 --> 24:10.581
BPITW, what's that mean?

24:10.583 --> 24:12.116
Best pal in the world.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.885
- Sending me texts on her last day.
- Katie.

24:14.887 --> 24:16.921
- So I'd feel better.
- I know.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.223
I got loads,
I got loads of ones like that.

24:19.225 --> 24:22.092
I'll show-- I'll show you my
favorite one, actually.

24:22.094 --> 24:26.230
This wasn't on her last day,
she'd died but it was, um...

24:27.733 --> 24:30.935
Singe's pepper sauce?
- Yeah, she loved my pepper sauce.

24:30.937 --> 24:32.837
She just wanted me
to remember that, you know.

24:33.206 --> 24:40.211
Um... 'Cause I to-- You know
I told her how frightened I was,

24:40.213 --> 24:42.746
you know, do you know
what I mean, about like...

24:43.616 --> 24:46.951
about being on my own with two little boys and stuff.
What was I gonna do without her?

24:46.953 --> 24:50.521
Um, and so what she'd do, she'd
send me like messages like that.

24:50.523 --> 24:53.591
She'd send me loads of them.
She'd write things down on Post-it Notes

24:53.593 --> 24:58.062
and, um, uh, little scraps of
paper and stuff.

24:58.064 --> 25:01.832
Like a-- like a written,
um, version of her.

25:02.835 --> 25:07.071
You know what I should do, Rach, is, um,
I should get them all together, shouldn't I?

25:07.073 --> 25:09.073
Like, all the-- all the texts
and the messages

25:09.075 --> 25:11.909
and I should put them all in one-- all in one thing,
shouldn't I?

25:13.045 --> 25:14.879
That'd be nice, wouldn't it?

26:31.624 --> 26:34.925

Come here.

27:56.375 --> 27:57.975
Oh, come on, Finn!

27:57.977 --> 28:00.044
When did your head get so big?

28:00.046 --> 28:01.845
I can't find my top!

28:01.847 --> 28:03.447
- Which top?
- The stripey one.

28:03.449 --> 28:06.116
It should be in here, mate. Have
you looked in here properly?

28:06.118 --> 28:08.152
Well, you haven't looked properly because it's literally right there.

28:08.154 --> 28:10.821
There's your stripey one,
put it on, please.

28:14.060 --> 28:17.428
Was I in Mommy's tummy at this time?
- Where?

28:17.430 --> 28:19.997
Oh, no, bloody hell, mate,
no, we were young there.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.165
I mean,
I was like, 20 years old.

28:21.167 --> 28:22.933
That was before I was even,

28:22.935 --> 28:24.802
you were even
a twinkle in my eye.

28:26.138 --> 28:28.005
Thank you, get in.

28:29.241 --> 28:31.909
I could not doubt that
this was the black spot.

28:32.778 --> 28:35.345
And taking it up I found
written on the other side

28:35.347 --> 28:39.349
in a very good,
clear hand this short message.

28:40.186 --> 28:44.321
"You have till ten tonight."

28:46.125 --> 28:47.124
I love you.

28:48.127 --> 28:50.327
Can you give me a little kiss.

28:52.364 --> 28:53.831
Okay, lie down.

28:54.467 --> 28:57.067
Time to go to sleep now, okay?

28:57.069 --> 28:58.769
Acres and acres,
my darlin' boys.

28:58.771 --> 29:00.904
- Acres and acres.
- Acres and acres.

29:20.893 --> 29:23.427
Stand up here, stand with me.

29:27.500 --> 29:28.432
Bye, bye, Mommy.

29:57.463 --> 29:58.996
Our lovely girl.

30:27.359 --> 30:29.393
Oh, you're too heavy for me.

30:30.095 --> 30:31.829
- Can you get the ball?
- Yeah.

30:31.831 --> 30:32.996
- Thanks very much.
- Yeah!

30:32.998 --> 30:35.299
You can try and
tackle me if you like.

30:49.081 --> 30:51.515
- So just cut it, yeah?
- Yeah.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.217
- Just give it a snip?
- Yeah!

30:54.987 --> 30:56.920
Do you want me to do it?

30:56.922 --> 30:58.121
No, no, it's fine, I'll do it.

30:58.123 --> 31:00.257
- What I'll do is,
I'll cut it like--

31:00.259 --> 31:01.709
Singe, just do it!

31:01.710 --> 31:03.160
- No, I'll cut it so far--
- Please.

31:03.162 --> 31:05.195
- And then you shave the rest of it, okay?
- Okay.

31:05.197 --> 31:06.263
- Alright, you ready?
- Yeah.

31:06.265 --> 31:07.531
Oh, bloody hell.

31:15.908 --> 31:16.974
Ah!

31:19.245 --> 31:20.310
- Okay?
- Yeah.

31:21.647 --> 31:23.280
Just put that there.

31:23.282 --> 31:24.248
And the rest.

31:25.484 --> 31:28.018
Okay, that's not
a bad little cut.

31:30.890 --> 31:32.089
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

31:32.091 --> 31:34.224
Yeah, we're ready.
Stars in our eyes.

31:42.434 --> 31:43.967
- Do you know what?
- What?

31:43.969 --> 31:45.135
Seriously,

31:45.137 --> 31:47.304
you look absolutely beautiful.

31:47.306 --> 31:49.206
Oh, Singe!

31:49.208 --> 31:51.408
- No, I mean it.
- You look like a boy.

31:51.977 --> 31:53.143
- True.
- Yeah, a sexy boy.

31:53.145 --> 31:55.045
- Come here.
- A boy I'd like to meet.

31:55.047 --> 31:57.214
Honestly, you look beautiful.

31:57.216 --> 32:00.284
- Well, we'll get used to it.
- I'll get used to it.

32:00.286 --> 32:02.386
But how will we know
who you are?

32:02.388 --> 32:04.388
I'm still the same,
I'm still your mom.

32:05.291 --> 32:08.659
We could always draw it on with a yellow pen if it helps.
Couldn't we?

32:08.661 --> 32:10.027
- That's not attractive.
- Not a bad idea.

32:42.528 --> 32:46.296
<i>¶ Have you seen</i>
<i>Something so beautiful ¶</i>

32:48.434 --> 32:52.402
<i>¶ You thought the world</i>

32:56.542 --> 33:00.711

33:17.997 --> 33:21.631
I want two boys, two girls,
a big, bustling, noisy family.

33:21.633 --> 33:23.200
All those kids running around us

33:23.202 --> 33:25.035
laughing and
playing and fighting.

33:25.637 --> 33:28.038
And we watch them grow and
they bring us some grandkids.

33:28.040 --> 33:30.374
- How many of those?
- Oh, an army.

33:30.376 --> 33:32.309
And they're all around us
and we're sitting

33:32.311 --> 33:36.646
there proudly thinking,
we started this.

33:37.149 --> 33:39.683
I love you, boys, I love you.

33:39.685 --> 33:41.785
<i>¶ Hold my hand</i>

33:54.466 --> 33:55.632
<i>- ¶ Every morning ¶</i>
- You look great.

33:55.634 --> 33:56.566
Thanks.

33:56.568 --> 34:02.706

<i>Hold your weary hand ¶</i>

34:03.509 --> 34:07.778
<i>¶ And tell you all the things</i>

34:07.780 --> 34:09.513
- So what happened this morning?
- Oh, it was a nightmare.

34:09.514 --> 34:11.348
Hold on, I've nearly done this.

34:12.117 --> 34:13.216
What about the boys?

34:15.353 --> 34:16.553
Grace, Kate.

34:18.257 --> 34:22.726
Yeah, these are
to counteract these.

34:25.597 --> 34:29.199
Which means I need these
to help with those.

34:30.735 --> 34:33.270
And these are
for everything else

34:33.272 --> 34:34.804
except they don't
deal with everything else

34:34.806 --> 34:36.773
so that's what these are for.

34:38.143 --> 34:39.342
And these.

34:43.181 --> 34:45.181
And do any of them taste like?

34:46.418 --> 34:47.617
Oh, you beauty!

35:10.476 --> 35:11.408
You okay?

35:13.579 --> 35:15.512
It's like I'm pregnant
all over again.

35:16.281 --> 35:18.248
Wait till you feel sick to eat.

35:19.451 --> 35:21.251
But, you know,
it makes me strong.

35:24.456 --> 35:25.822
Helps so much it's Mexican.

35:33.365 --> 35:35.298
I know I might not
get through this.

35:36.301 --> 35:37.801
God, Kate,
am I gonna need tissues?

35:37.803 --> 35:38.735
No, I'm just saying,

35:38.737 --> 35:40.370
I'm gonna fight.

35:40.372 --> 35:42.339
I'm never not gonna do that.

35:43.308 --> 35:44.641
But I also want to prepare.

35:46.311 --> 35:48.678
I owe it to the boys
and to Singe.

35:50.816 --> 35:53.483
I just wish I could
tell Singe to prepare as well.

35:54.653 --> 35:58.722
Good luck with that.
He'll keep running if it means he doesn't have to look back.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.291
You'll be there for him, though?

36:01.293 --> 36:02.526
Him and the boys.

36:04.296 --> 36:05.395
Of course, I would.

36:08.734 --> 36:10.267
But you're gonna get well.

36:11.503 --> 36:12.435
End of.

36:14.573 --> 36:16.673
And you said
I wouldn't need tissues.

36:26.785 --> 36:27.784
Hello.

36:28.253 --> 36:29.186
Hiya.

36:30.255 --> 36:31.955
- Okay?
- Yeah, good.

36:31.957 --> 36:33.223
Great.

36:34.626 --> 36:35.959
- What?
- What?

36:38.564 --> 36:41.898
- You're such a giveaway.
- What do you mean giveaway? What are you talking about?

36:41.900 --> 36:43.700
- So why the look?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

36:43.702 --> 36:47.604
- I don't have a look.
- What are you up to?

36:48.473 --> 36:50.607
- What are you two doing there?
- What are those kids up to standing there like that?

36:50.609 --> 36:52.509
- Huh?
- I don't know what.

36:52.511 --> 36:54.277
- Something's going on.
- Nothing's going on.

36:54.279 --> 36:58.848
- Chill out, will you?
- Oh, my God!

36:58.850 --> 37:01.618
- Where's that come from?
- I knew you were up to something!

37:01.620 --> 37:04.421
I ain't done nothing.
It'll look much better when

37:04.423 --> 37:05.822
all the fish and everything's
going in there.

37:23.375 --> 37:26.743
So, I'm gonna
go for a run, okay?

37:26.745 --> 37:28.912
I can pass by the shop,
see if you need anything.

37:28.914 --> 37:31.381
- I'll be fine.
- No?

37:32.651 --> 37:34.818
Okay, um, so, um...

37:35.320 --> 37:38.421
Yeah, I'll...
I'll go and get changed.

38:25.037 --> 38:25.969
Okay, bro?

38:29.474 --> 38:31.474
He had a 6 % chance
of survival, mate.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.844
He had 60 doses
of general anesthetic.

38:35.647 --> 38:36.980
30 rounds of radiotherapy.

38:37.649 --> 38:38.715
40 of chemo.

38:39.351 --> 38:41.017
I used to have to
go into his room

38:41.019 --> 38:43.953
and untie him
every night because he,

38:43.955 --> 38:47.624
when he tossed and turned he got all the
tubes wrap-- wrapped around himself.

38:47.626 --> 38:50.694
And I signed off on every single fucking one of them just because,
you know,

38:50.696 --> 38:53.463
because I had to, just so he could be here now,
standing here, growing up.

38:53.465 --> 38:55.665
He had eight tubes in his body,
man, eight tubes.

38:55.667 --> 38:56.966
You imagine that?

38:56.968 --> 38:58.835
His mouth was
riddled with ulcers.

38:58.837 --> 39:00.937
He was in bed 24/7,
observation on the hour,

39:00.939 --> 39:02.872
through the night,
every single hour.

39:03.709 --> 39:08.545
When he, um,
when he had the chemo his nappies were radioactive.

39:08.547 --> 39:11.648
We used to have to...

39:11.650 --> 39:12.916
We used to have to
wear disposable rubber gloves

39:12.918 --> 39:13.850
to change him.

39:16.488 --> 39:19.956
The chemo made his,
um, urine toxic,

39:19.958 --> 39:24.594
you know, so, it burnt
our hands, when we'd change him.

39:24.596 --> 39:26.062
There's other people
worrying about

39:26.064 --> 39:28.531
wh-- wh-- what organic food
to give their kids

39:28.533 --> 39:29.899
or what will happen to
their kid if they give it

39:29.901 --> 39:31.101
another fucking
scoop of ice cream

39:31.103 --> 39:32.669
and then where we are, you know.

39:32.671 --> 39:34.437
Pumping as many
deadly chemicals into

39:34.439 --> 39:36.439
his tiny little body
as he could take.

39:37.409 --> 39:40.143
Because killing that thing,
that had to come first, Matt!

39:42.080 --> 39:43.813
It had to come first,
it had to come second,

39:43.815 --> 39:45.815
it had to come third,
it had to come fourth!

39:47.853 --> 39:49.819
And the amount of times
that me and Kate

39:49.821 --> 39:52.856
that we'd sit there
and we would wish it was us

39:52.858 --> 39:54.691
and not him, not our little boy,

39:56.128 --> 39:57.127
and now it is Kate!

39:58.497 --> 39:59.996
It is, it's fucking Kate!

40:12.544 --> 40:13.676
You said it, Singe.

40:13.678 --> 40:17.580
All the shit you put him
through and he's still here.

40:19.751 --> 40:22.152
'Cause that's what this does,
it keeps 'em here.

40:24.823 --> 40:26.122
Yeah, I know, mate.

40:28.527 --> 40:31.761
Bloody hell, pull yourself together, Singe,
this is ridiculous.

40:31.763 --> 40:35.198
Coming in here
crying like a baby.

40:35.667 --> 40:39.936
- In front of my fucking little brother, it's ridiculous.
- Anytime.

40:39.938 --> 40:42.071
I know, but don't tell
anyone about this, alright?

40:42.073 --> 40:44.474
You know, I know, I know you.

40:44.476 --> 40:48.778
Ridiculous, geez Louise.

40:50.449 --> 40:52.182
Alright, mate, I'll see you later, yeah?
I'll give you a call.

40:52.184 --> 40:53.616
Yeah, yeah, call me later.

41:07.999 --> 41:11.534
What the hell am I doing going to a nightclub of all places?

41:11.536 --> 41:12.936
It's
a family birthday, Singe.

41:12.938 --> 41:14.204
Yeah, but a family birthday
in a night club?

41:14.206 --> 41:15.772
Relax,
it's an evening out,

41:15.774 --> 41:17.640
- just enjoy it.
- Well, I'll try.

41:17.642 --> 41:20.243
- You better, that's part of the deal.
- I'll give it a go.

41:20.245 --> 41:22.479
Alright, then, give us a call
if there's any problems, okay?

41:22.481 --> 41:24.180
- There won't be, it's fine.
- Alright, babe, see you.

41:24.182 --> 41:25.515
Bye!

41:25.517 --> 41:30.053
There is the happy couple!
Hello, darling, happy birthday!

41:30.055 --> 41:32.789
- Thank you for making it!
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.

41:32.791 --> 41:33.857
- How are you?
- I'm good.

41:33.859 --> 41:35.492
- Hello, Matthew.
- Good to see you.

41:35.494 --> 41:36.593
- Glad you came out.
- Thanks.

41:36.595 --> 41:37.527
- I'll get drinks.
- Thank you.

41:37.529 --> 41:39.607
- Looking very pretty on your birthday.
- Thank you!

41:39.608 --> 41:41.686
I think you've got
some folks coming out tonight.

41:41.687 --> 41:43.765
- We've a good turnout so far.
- Nice venue, well done.

41:43.768 --> 41:45.268
- Yeah, how you doing?
- Singe!

41:45.270 --> 41:47.637
Yes, mate, I'll have
a Bacardi Breezer, please.

41:47.639 --> 41:49.506
No, I'll have a pint of lager,
what are you talking about?

41:49.508 --> 41:50.907
What do you fancy, Kate?

41:55.247 --> 41:57.113
Well, it's good to see ya.

41:57.115 --> 41:58.715
Glad you came over, man.

41:58.717 --> 42:05.522
Um, sorry, man. Why don't you
get a drink in there and we'll--

42:05.524 --> 42:07.624
I'm just gonna go
and take a second outside.

42:07.625 --> 42:09.725
- Singe, bro, bro!
- I won't be long.

42:09.728 --> 42:11.661
<i>¶ Your reason for leaving ¶</i>

42:11.663 --> 42:13.997
<i>¶ Don't ask me what it means ¶</i>

42:30.115 --> 42:34.717
<i>¶ Won't you come see about me ¶</i>

42:34.719 --> 42:37.120
<i>¶ I'll be alone ¶</i>

42:37.122 --> 42:40.089
<i>¶ Dancing, you know it, baby ¶</i>

42:40.091 --> 42:44.661
<i>¶ Tell me your troubles</i>
<i>And doubts ¶</i>

42:44.663 --> 42:47.030
<i>- ¶ Giving me everything ¶</i>
- I've got that feeling again.

42:47.032 --> 42:50.033
<i>- ¶ Inside and out and ¶</i>
- What feeling's that?

42:50.035 --> 42:52.035
That luckiest guy
in the world feeling.

42:52.037 --> 42:54.270
<i>¶ So real in the dark ¶</i>

42:54.272 --> 42:56.906
<i>¶ Think of the tender things ¶</i>

42:56.908 --> 42:59.943
<i>¶ That we were working on ¶</i>

42:59.945 --> 43:04.280
<i>¶ Slow change</i>
<i>May pull us apart ¶</i>

43:04.282 --> 43:09.218
<i>¶ When the light gets</i>
<i>Into your heart, baby ¶</i>

43:09.220 --> 43:11.654
I don't believe it, look!

43:11.656 --> 43:12.855
Thank you,
field fairies, thank you!

43:13.191 --> 43:14.791
<i>¶ Forget about me ¶</i>

43:14.793 --> 43:16.125
What are you doing?

43:16.127 --> 43:18.861
- I've got to tape it.
- Why?

43:18.863 --> 43:20.296
Keep it safe.

43:20.298 --> 43:24.100
<i>¶ Don't you forget about me ¶</i>

43:26.972 --> 43:30.006
- You take this clover thing pretty seriously, don't you?
- Mm-hmm.

43:30.008 --> 43:33.242
<i>- ¶ Will you stand above me ¶</i>
- Here, look.

43:33.244 --> 43:35.912
<i>- ¶ Look my way ¶</i>
- It's a three.

43:35.914 --> 43:38.348
- A what?
- A three leaf, I only want fours.

43:38.350 --> 43:39.782
Oh, what's wrong with threes?

43:39.784 --> 43:41.751
- They're not fours!
- Oh!

43:41.987 --> 43:43.319
Look, now I've got six.

43:44.856 --> 43:46.222
And now I've got nine.

43:47.058 --> 43:48.691
- Now, I've got 12.
- You taking the Mickey?

43:48.693 --> 43:50.727
- Now I've got 14.
- Are you taking the Mickey?

43:50.729 --> 43:52.061
- Now, will you--
- Are you taking the Mickey?

43:52.063 --> 43:53.129
Of course!

43:54.065 --> 43:58.267
<i>¶ Will you call my name ¶</i>

43:58.269 --> 44:03.673
<i>¶ Come on and call my name ¶</i>

44:03.675 --> 44:05.675
<i>¶ Will you call my name ¶</i>

44:05.677 --> 44:08.311
It just hit me,
you know, it was like,

44:08.313 --> 44:10.847
I'm never gonna be able to make
love to my beautiful wife again.

44:14.719 --> 44:16.719
So your last words were sorry.

44:16.721 --> 44:18.988
I didn't know
what you meant by that.

44:18.990 --> 44:20.923
I used to think
that it was because...

44:23.695 --> 44:25.328
because you didn't think
it would end this way.

44:30.201 --> 44:32.902
But I think you said it because

44:35.073 --> 44:36.873
you knew
I didn't think it would.

44:40.145 --> 44:42.211
You're through
the worst of it, Kate.

44:43.448 --> 44:45.415
The discomfort's
gonna be acute, though.

44:45.417 --> 44:48.918
So, painkillers, antibiotics
is the order of the day.

44:49.821 --> 44:51.921
Obviously,
it's gonna be a number of years

44:51.923 --> 44:53.823
before we can say
that you're through

44:53.825 --> 44:57.360
the cancer completely,
but it's a great start.

44:57.362 --> 44:59.328
We've drawn a line in the sand.

44:59.330 --> 45:01.064
We've got a horizon to aim for.

45:08.339 --> 45:09.772
Oh, this is nice.

45:12.110 --> 45:13.376
This is nice!

45:18.483 --> 45:20.483
Can you believe it?

45:20.485 --> 45:24.253
Us, now, here, this?

45:24.889 --> 45:25.955
A bit rad.

45:28.059 --> 45:30.460
It feels like we've
turned a corner, Singe.

45:30.462 --> 45:31.894
It really feels like it.

45:34.265 --> 45:35.198
Like fresh air.

45:40.972 --> 45:42.138
Acres and acres, Kate.

45:43.508 --> 45:45.174
Acres and acres, my darlin'.

46:06.131 --> 46:09.465
- I won! - Is that a moon?
- Yeah, it's a half moon.

46:09.467 --> 46:12.101
What do you mean, is that
a moon? That's my best moon!

46:12.103 --> 46:14.203
- Daddy got it in three.
- Yeah, I'm gonna have to...

46:14.205 --> 46:16.873
You could have done a curve!

46:16.875 --> 46:18.775
- Alright, who's up next?
- Me! - Me again!

46:18.777 --> 46:20.009
- Okay.
- Do you wanna take it off?

46:20.011 --> 46:21.511
- Ow!
- Take it off her.

46:21.513 --> 46:26.916
Goodnight, my sweetheart.
Acres and acres.

46:26.918 --> 46:28.417
Acres and acres, Mom.

46:32.457 --> 46:34.824
Goodnight, Reefie.

46:37.462 --> 46:39.996
You can sleep here if you want.

46:41.065 --> 46:44.433
- I always used to get tired after the treatment.
- Yeah?

46:44.435 --> 46:49.038
- Yeah.
- You know, maybe I will come close my eyes for a little bit.

46:50.074 --> 46:51.174
Lie down.

47:07.492 --> 47:09.592
- You wanna go and play Snakes on the phone?
- Yeah.

47:09.594 --> 47:11.427
Then go inside.

47:20.572 --> 47:24.407
Worse than my sufferings is that
we put him through all that.

47:27.245 --> 47:28.211
Yeah, but he's here though,
isn't he?

47:28.213 --> 47:29.145
He's healthy.

47:32.116 --> 47:34.584
- Rollercoaster, right?
- Yeah, you said it'd be.

47:39.290 --> 47:41.457
Alright, I've got mine open.

47:41.459 --> 47:43.192
Oh, Reef!

47:43.194 --> 47:45.461
That's so nice, thank you!

47:46.531 --> 47:47.997
Beautiful drawings, babe.

47:48.633 --> 47:50.533
Those hearts are fantastic!

47:51.569 --> 47:53.302
Here's another one.

47:58.376 --> 47:59.508
It's so good.

48:02.347 --> 48:03.279
Get your bags.

48:03.281 --> 48:05.047
Have you gotta pee, no?

48:05.049 --> 48:06.182
Are you sure?

48:07.018 --> 48:08.951
Got your snacks, then?

48:57.135 --> 48:58.968
Listen, I think
you should go in, okay?

49:04.142 --> 49:05.174
I can't.

49:12.383 --> 49:14.684
It looks and sounds
like a lung infection.

49:15.620 --> 49:19.588
The chemotherapy and radiotherapy may have caused damage.

49:20.558 --> 49:23.626
You might have had
a latent tuberculosis

49:23.628 --> 49:24.961
which was triggered.

49:25.496 --> 49:27.496
But we're gonna
cover all the bases.

49:28.066 --> 49:30.700
We'll have test results
in a matter of days.

49:45.450 --> 49:47.116
It doesn't fit anymore.

49:49.988 --> 49:51.387
We'll just get it adjusted, eh.

50:08.439 --> 50:10.506
Again?

50:12.310 --> 50:14.210
Clear the way, clear the way!

51:00.491 --> 51:02.525
Kate, I have bad news.

51:03.795 --> 51:07.530
Neither the chemotherapy,
nor the radiotherapy has worked.

51:08.332 --> 51:10.066
And the
secondary cancer has spread

51:10.068 --> 51:11.801
to your lungs and your bones.

51:15.139 --> 51:18.240
Further chemotherapy
is not going to help.

51:20.378 --> 51:21.577
We've done all we can.

51:24.382 --> 51:26.282
Your lungs are damaged,
but we can drain

51:26.284 --> 51:28.384
them regularly and frequently.

51:28.386 --> 51:30.786
Why?

51:30.788 --> 51:33.122
Sorry,
why do we need to drain them?

51:33.124 --> 51:35.291
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

51:35.293 --> 51:37.293
How much time do I have?

51:37.295 --> 51:38.227
How much?

51:39.730 --> 51:41.263
Call Singe.

51:41.265 --> 51:42.598
I want Singe.

51:42.600 --> 51:44.233
I want him here.

51:44.235 --> 51:46.168
This is too soon.

51:46.170 --> 51:47.503
I need him here.

51:47.505 --> 51:49.839
This isn't right,
this is too soon!

51:49.841 --> 51:52.374
I'm not ready for it
to be this soon!

51:52.877 --> 51:55.411
There's stuff we need to do,
it's too soon!

52:10.161 --> 52:13.162
- Bye.
- Come on, let's go, let's skedaddle.

52:14.432 --> 52:18.434
- Oh, nice, yeah. Catch that one.
- Blow a kiss.

52:18.436 --> 52:20.669
Spread it on
your face, let's go.

52:21.706 --> 52:24.240
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye, darling.

52:47.899 --> 52:49.265
I love you.

53:36.347 --> 53:38.247
<i>¶ I promised you a miracle ¶</i>

53:38.249 --> 53:39.348
Happy birthday, Kate.

53:39.350 --> 53:40.549
Thank you, Singe.

53:40.551 --> 53:42.284
- Here you go.
- Oh!

53:42.887 --> 53:45.387
- Thank you.
- That's alright.

53:45.389 --> 53:46.755
- So?
- Nine o'clock.

53:46.757 --> 53:47.790
- Yeah?
- That's my birthday.

53:47.792 --> 53:48.924
Cool, yeah.

53:50.595 --> 53:52.494
- Wait, we're talking about--
- Yeah.

53:52.496 --> 53:56.599
- Yeah, yeah. The kiss?
- Yeah.

53:56.601 --> 53:58.968
Yeah, yeah, that's fine,
I'm just checking, yeah?

53:59.737 --> 54:02.638
But somewhere private,
I don't want people seeing.

54:04.308 --> 54:05.741
Outside the back door.

54:05.743 --> 54:06.942
No one ever goes there.

54:06.944 --> 54:08.377
Perfect.

54:08.746 --> 54:10.479
- Nine prompt!
- See you there.

54:11.616 --> 54:14.984
<i>¶ Promised you a miracle ¶</i>

54:18.823 --> 54:19.989
I thought
you said nine prompt?

54:19.991 --> 54:21.423
It is nine prompt!

54:21.425 --> 54:23.259
- You're just keen.
- Oh...

54:25.029 --> 54:27.529
Alright, how's that?

54:27.531 --> 54:28.464
There you go.

54:30.901 --> 54:31.867
Happy birthday again.

54:32.336 --> 54:33.569
Thank you, again.

54:51.789 --> 54:53.389
Do you believe in soul mates?

54:54.825 --> 54:56.759
I reckon you can make me.

55:01.599 --> 55:04.667
<i>I promise</i>
<i>to love you forever,</i>

55:04.669 --> 55:06.902
<i>kiss you every</i>
<i>time you come home,</i>

55:06.904 --> 55:08.570
<i>make you smile,</i>

55:08.572 --> 55:09.538
<i>surprise you,</i>

55:10.508 --> 55:11.607
<i>always be there.</i>

55:19.784 --> 55:22.318
- So, what's this?
- It's a contract.

55:22.320 --> 55:24.453
- Yeah, but for who?
- For you.

55:24.455 --> 55:26.989
What, you want me to sign a contract?
- Yes.

55:26.991 --> 55:29.425
You actually want me to sign a contract to prove that I love you?

55:29.427 --> 55:31.427
- Singe!
- No, no, no, look, I'll sign it.

55:31.429 --> 55:35.464
I'm just saying,
a contract?

55:35.466 --> 55:37.800
- This is important, Singe!
- Yeah, I know!

55:37.802 --> 55:39.335
- Are you able to sign it?
- Yes!

55:39.337 --> 55:43.839
Are you willing
to sign it?

55:46.610 --> 55:49.378
- You haven't even signed it.
- Yeah, well, I'm kissing you!

55:49.380 --> 55:50.979
God, you're so bossy.

55:59.724 --> 56:02.758
I love
you yards and yards.

56:03.527 --> 56:07.563
I love you miles and miles.

56:08.733 --> 56:11.133
- Acres and acres.
- Oh, that's a good one.

56:12.670 --> 56:14.503
I love you acres and acres.

56:14.505 --> 56:16.038
Yeah, I like that,
that's the one to beat.

56:16.774 --> 56:19.408
Singe, I just told you
I loved you acres and acres.

56:19.410 --> 56:20.943
Yeah, I know,
and I just told you you won.

56:20.945 --> 56:22.644
Okay, okay!

56:23.080 --> 56:26.582
I love you acres and acres.

57:02.720 --> 57:05.921
You finish
your Cocoa Puffs? Yeah?

57:05.923 --> 57:08.757
Okay,
I'll just be back in a sec.

57:33.083 --> 57:34.016
What is it?

57:37.721 --> 57:38.654
Singe?

57:47.598 --> 57:49.965
I don't think I can
do this without you, Kate.

57:53.003 --> 57:54.470
Yes, you can.

57:56.240 --> 57:59.141
- No, I don't.
- Singe, you can.

57:59.143 --> 58:00.509
No, I don't, I don't.

58:00.511 --> 58:02.644
I don't because.

58:02.646 --> 58:03.745
Darlin'.

58:04.849 --> 58:06.748
I don't, darlin',
because.

58:07.518 --> 58:08.617
Come here.

58:16.794 --> 58:17.726
Singe.

58:20.531 --> 58:21.263
You can.

59:10.648 --> 59:13.048
Kiss the boys two times
after I've gone.

59:14.084 --> 59:15.918
Hang pictures of us
in their room.

59:16.820 --> 59:19.288
And measure me on the doorframe.

59:19.290 --> 59:23.592
Mommy was five feet one inch
and a bit, size five feet.

59:26.897 --> 59:29.932
Mommy loved Finn's laugh
and how he sucked

59:29.934 --> 59:31.700
his thumb and folded his ear in.

59:34.939 --> 59:38.807
She liked walks down the
river bank and catching crabs.

59:39.944 --> 59:43.045
She liked learning
butterfly names and bird names.

59:43.047 --> 59:44.846
And she'd loved to
have hand-fed a wild tarpon

59:44.848 --> 59:46.915
like she used to
feed the squirrels.

59:50.154 --> 59:52.220
Rachel's good
for parenting advice.

59:52.222 --> 59:54.590
She has two boys
the same age gap.

59:57.261 --> 59:59.828
Always kiss goodbye
and goodnight.

01:00:05.302 --> 01:00:08.003
Grow a sunflower
every now and again.

01:00:08.005 --> 01:00:11.306
And I'd love the boys
to find four leaf clovers.

01:00:11.308 --> 01:00:14.376
Don't fill your outside with
boats, give them space to play.

01:00:15.346 --> 01:00:18.013
Would like school photos
bought each year.

01:00:18.015 --> 01:00:19.681
One day they'll thank you.

01:00:22.152 --> 01:00:25.887
I'd love the boys to find
one of those fairy mushrooms.

01:00:25.889 --> 01:00:28.657
You know, the red ones
with white bits on?

01:00:28.659 --> 01:00:30.926
And take them for walks
along Mommy's favorite beach

01:00:30.928 --> 01:00:32.694
where she used to go as a child.

01:00:35.899 --> 01:00:37.866
Finn's cuddles
were always special.

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:41.637
And I loved
Reef-cuddles at night.

01:00:43.674 --> 01:00:45.107
Infinity elves.

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:57.052
Take them to Lundy and
an international rugby game.

01:00:57.054 --> 01:00:59.254
And buy a boat with
seats so they can sit

01:00:59.256 --> 01:01:01.423
and watch the sea to
their heart's content.

01:01:02.793 --> 01:01:05.927
I'd love it if Reef would
learn recorder and guitar,

01:01:05.929 --> 01:01:07.896
and Finn the drums and keyboard.

01:01:09.933 --> 01:01:12.234
Go see the Northern Lights.

01:01:12.236 --> 01:01:14.703
Take them to where
Daddy proposed to Mommy.

01:01:16.707 --> 01:01:22.711
Mommy loved moths
and snakes and slow worms

01:01:24.248 --> 01:01:26.148
and orange club biscuits.

01:01:26.784 --> 01:01:29.151
And jam and jelly
and lemon curd.

01:01:30.054 --> 01:01:35.857
I loved ivory roses
and daisies and gypsophila.

01:01:36.694 --> 01:01:38.427
And guinea pigs and butterflies.

01:01:39.263 --> 01:01:42.130
And walnut whips and
strawberry cheesecake.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.766
And Singe's pepper sauce.

01:01:46.303 --> 01:01:48.437
Celebrate birthdays big time.

01:01:49.006 --> 01:01:50.138
I know you will.

01:01:51.909 --> 01:01:55.177
Kiss goodbye, even if
leaving for a short while.

01:01:57.214 --> 01:02:00.115
And take lots of pictures
of my beautiful boys,

01:02:00.718 --> 01:02:02.317
especially in their teens.

01:02:03.954 --> 01:02:07.723
And please keep using
the phrase acres and acres.

01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:09.157
I love that!

01:02:10.994 --> 01:02:12.260
I love that.

01:02:15.966 --> 01:02:18.066
My mom to arrange the funeral.

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:22.370
Always help the boys
if they ask.

01:02:23.207 --> 01:02:25.107
Teach them to respect women.

01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:27.809
Teach them to be on time
and to say what they mean.

01:02:28.145 --> 01:02:31.012
Don't let them smoke
and remind them why.

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:37.219
Mommy loved how sparkly
their eyes were in Lapland.

01:02:40.491 --> 01:02:43.291
Remember, joint bank accounts
under your name

01:02:43.293 --> 01:02:45.527
and ask Dad to help
with finances.

01:02:48.132 --> 01:02:51.166
Never leave more than a week
before making up.

01:02:51.168 --> 01:02:52.768
Life's too short.

01:03:01.411 --> 01:03:06.815
I'd like drawings
and pictures of the boys

01:03:07.384 --> 01:03:10.118
and Christmas
cards and birthday cards.

01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:12.320
I'd like those in with me.

01:03:13.924 --> 01:03:14.856
And then,

01:03:17.895 --> 01:03:20.262
put me on top
of the wardrobe for

01:03:20.264 --> 01:03:22.998
a while with the cuddly toys.

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:25.233
Just for a while.

01:03:26.236 --> 01:03:27.169
Just...

01:03:31.542 --> 01:03:33.341
Just for a little bit longer.

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:55.997
- Hello.
- You okay?

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:57.866
Yeah, I'm alright.
Shall I come in?

01:03:57.868 --> 01:03:59.067
- Mm-hmm.
- Alright.

01:04:05.042 --> 01:04:08.109
- It's a lovely place.
- Yeah, it is, it's a funny little town.

01:04:08.111 --> 01:04:10.412
You get beautiful sunsets
down by the sea.

01:04:14.284 --> 01:04:16.117
Do you mind me asking
how you're coping

01:04:16.119 --> 01:04:17.252
since you lost your wife?

01:04:19.056 --> 01:04:22.390
Oh, sorry, that was
a bit abrupt, wasn't it?

01:04:22.392 --> 01:04:24.593
No, no, not at all,
no, it wasn't abrupt.

01:04:24.595 --> 01:04:27.429
I'm ju-- it's just I'm not
used to people asking, you know.

01:04:27.431 --> 01:04:30.866
Not like that.
- Oh, God, I really have put my foot in it, haven't I?

01:04:30.868 --> 01:04:32.934
No, you haven't, no, um...

01:04:32.936 --> 01:04:35.904
- It's actually quite refreshing.
- You don't have to answer, honestly.

01:04:35.906 --> 01:04:38.406
It's refreshing to be asked that directly and
I do want to answer because I'm actually

01:04:38.408 --> 01:04:39.941
quite interested to hear what
I have to say on the subject.

01:04:39.943 --> 01:04:43.445
Oh, bloody hell,
how am I coping? Um...

01:04:47.551 --> 01:04:50.218
I'm just trying to
think of a way that...

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:54.422
Okay, it's like I'm standing
on a shoreline, you know

01:04:54.424 --> 01:04:56.892
on a beach or whatever
and it's like

01:04:56.894 --> 01:05:00.362
getting hit with um,
wave after wave, you know.

01:05:01.365 --> 01:05:02.631
And then,
you get hit by the waves,

01:05:02.633 --> 01:05:04.132
the undertow
will suck you under.

01:05:05.602 --> 01:05:07.669
Um, and then sometimes
it feels like it's,

01:05:07.671 --> 01:05:10.005
you know, that you're not
gonna be able to get out.

01:05:10.007 --> 01:05:15.644
You know, you can't breathe and
um, it's like totally...

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:20.515
And then, and then you know
time passes, doesn't it?

01:05:20.517 --> 01:05:24.286
And then, the waves are still there,
and they're still hitting you,

01:05:24.288 --> 01:05:26.988
and your feet are
unsteady, you know.

01:05:28.091 --> 01:05:29.090
But you do get out.

01:05:31.929 --> 01:05:34.996
And then when you,
when you're out, you find

01:05:34.998 --> 01:05:37.232
that you're just ever so slightly further up the shoreline.

01:05:38.368 --> 01:05:40.602
I suppose it's
one way of putting it.

01:05:42.706 --> 01:05:45.640
Bloody hell, sorry, carry on.
Don't let me ruin the evening.

01:05:45.642 --> 01:05:48.043
- More wine?
- Oh, yeah, go on, darling, thank you.

01:05:49.513 --> 01:05:54.082
Um, I mean,
one thing I do worry about is that I've got two little boys.

01:05:54.084 --> 01:05:56.551
And, um, I'm just worried
I'm indulging them too much.

01:05:57.387 --> 01:05:59.321
They're happy, Singe.

01:05:59.323 --> 01:06:00.956
That's all Kate ever wanted.

01:06:03.126 --> 01:06:04.426
So you must be
doing something right.

01:06:05.162 --> 01:06:06.461
Yeah, thank you.

01:06:14.037 --> 01:06:17.005
<i>¶ You only get one life ¶</i>

01:06:17.007 --> 01:06:19.107
<i>¶ And I'm gonna live it ¶</i>

01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:21.376
<i>¶ I wanna give it to you ¶</i>

01:06:21.378 --> 01:06:24.212
<i>¶ No more goodbyes ¶</i>

01:06:28.452 --> 01:06:31.219
- How would you get someone with that? What would you do?
- Poke him in the eye!

01:06:31.221 --> 01:06:32.420
Poke him in the eye.

01:06:38.428 --> 01:06:42.297
<i>¶ Keeps my feet on this Earth ¶</i>

01:06:45.502 --> 01:06:47.435
Are you stuffing your face?
- There you go.

01:06:47.437 --> 01:06:49.004
Everyone,
it's cake time!

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:55.276
<i>¶ Happy birthday to you ¶</i>

01:06:55.278 --> 01:06:59.014
<i>¶ Happy birthday to you ¶</i>

01:06:59.016 --> 01:07:04.119
<i>¶ Happy birthday, dear Reef ¶</i>

01:07:04.121 --> 01:07:07.155
<i>¶ Happy birthday to you ¶</i>

01:07:07.157 --> 01:07:10.091
Blow them out, yay, yay!

01:07:10.694 --> 01:07:12.794
Hip hip, hooray!

01:07:12.796 --> 01:07:14.529
Hip hip, hooray!

01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:16.064
Hip hip, hooray!

01:07:44.428 --> 01:07:46.594
She wanted to be the
best mom in the world, you know.

01:07:46.596 --> 01:07:48.830
She is the best mom
in the world.

01:07:48.832 --> 01:07:50.298
Was.

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:51.499
What?

01:07:51.501 --> 01:07:53.234
You said is.

01:07:53.236 --> 01:07:56.271
- Well, she still is.
- I suppose.

01:07:56.273 --> 01:07:58.273
- Do you know what premature means?
- No.

01:07:58.275 --> 01:08:01.309
- Um, does it mean you're like--
- What?

01:08:01.311 --> 01:08:04.179
- Come out of the tummy?
- Come out too early?

01:08:04.181 --> 01:08:06.381
Yeah when you come out too
early. Good boys, yeah.

01:08:06.616 --> 01:08:10.852
Um, so, you come out too early,
right, you were premature.

01:08:10.854 --> 01:08:12.620
So you were, yeah.

01:08:12.622 --> 01:08:14.556
So you were in one area
of the hospital

01:08:14.558 --> 01:08:16.424
and your mommy was in
another area of the hospital.

01:08:16.426 --> 01:08:20.194
- And then you, you were off--
- In a different place.

01:08:20.197 --> 01:08:22.697
Getting-- in another place getting your chemotherapy and that, right?

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:26.201
So, um, it was horrible
'cause we were all on our own

01:08:26.203 --> 01:08:29.470
and we were all lonely and, um,
I used to rush from place to place to place.

01:08:29.473 --> 01:08:34.509
Um, and uh, it would have
been about two weeks,

01:08:34.511 --> 01:08:37.511
oh, it's crazy, it would
have been about two weeks,

01:08:37.514 --> 01:08:39.848
yeah, before she got to hold
you both together, right?

01:08:41.384 --> 01:08:45.653
And um, she always said that
that was the best moment

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:47.788
of her life
when she got you there

01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:49.357
for the first time in her arms.

01:09:01.671 --> 01:09:03.671
How many
gears are there?

01:09:03.673 --> 01:09:05.540
- Usually six.
- Five.

01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:09.210
- See, there's one, two, three?
- What do you think of stuff?

01:09:09.212 --> 01:09:12.479
- In your hand.
- The boy who rides it, will get loads of things.

01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:14.682
- Yeah.
- I got mine for my birthday.

01:09:14.684 --> 01:09:16.651
What are you gonna move it with
when I do that?

01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:18.620
I've been thinking.

01:09:18.622 --> 01:09:21.322
I'm gonna get my handprint--

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:23.291
Yeah, thanks.

01:09:23.292 --> 01:09:26.560
My handprint put on a canvas
and I thought

01:09:26.563 --> 01:09:28.229
it'd be nice if we all did it.

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:29.930
What color?

01:09:31.434 --> 01:09:32.834
Any colors we want.

01:09:32.836 --> 01:09:36.237
- Brown?
- Sure.

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:39.274
- Hmm-mm.
- What color do you want for your handprint?

01:09:39.276 --> 01:09:40.508
- What color do you want?
- Green!

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:41.776
- You want green?
- Yeah.

01:09:41.778 --> 01:09:44.612
- I want red and blue.
- Do you now?

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:47.182
- Sure you want brown, mate?
- Yeah.

01:09:48.318 --> 01:09:49.951
Like poo brown?

01:09:49.953 --> 01:09:50.885
Yeah.

01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:54.589
Alright,
I better go shopping then.

01:09:57.294 --> 01:09:59.827
- Bro?
- Oh, hello mate, thank you.

01:09:59.829 --> 01:10:01.529
- Thanks so much for sorting this out.
- No worries.

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:02.730
- No, it's cool.
- That's a nice size, isn't it?

01:10:02.732 --> 01:10:04.732
Yeah, I think
it should be alright.

01:10:04.734 --> 01:10:06.334
- Okay, let's have a look.
- A few colors.

01:10:06.336 --> 01:10:07.835
Let's see.

01:10:07.837 --> 01:10:10.305
Oh, yeah, you got the brown,
he wanted the brown.

01:10:10.307 --> 01:10:11.639
- Yeah, yeah.
- How's it wash off?

01:10:11.641 --> 01:10:12.907
Should be nice,
just soap and water.

01:10:12.909 --> 01:10:14.242
- Oh, yeah?
- Should be easy, yeah.

01:10:14.244 --> 01:10:15.643
Alright, sweet.

01:10:15.645 --> 01:10:17.312
- Thanks, bro.
- Oh, no worries.

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:23.685
Okay, let's go. Okay.

01:10:23.687 --> 01:10:26.554
- That's rather a lot.
- A bit more, knock yourself out.

01:10:26.556 --> 01:10:28.790
- Shhh...
- And nice, sweet as a nut.

01:10:29.893 --> 01:10:32.760
- Oh, that's a relief.
- It's a sausage!

01:10:32.762 --> 01:10:34.429
Oh, I feel
so much better now.

01:10:34.431 --> 01:10:36.264
Shall we do Mom's one?

01:10:36.266 --> 01:10:37.799
Okay, that's it.

01:10:39.302 --> 01:10:40.835
Alright, let's
put your hand in first.

01:10:40.837 --> 01:10:44.372
- Ready, one?
- On one, okay.

01:10:44.374 --> 01:10:45.373
What's the secret here?

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:46.608
Spread your fingers out.

01:10:47.777 --> 01:10:48.710
One,

01:10:49.779 --> 01:10:51.980
two.

01:10:51.982 --> 01:10:52.914
Da, da!

01:10:54.284 --> 01:10:56.251
Okay. Oh!

01:10:56.253 --> 01:10:58.386
I can't it.

01:10:58.788 --> 01:11:00.455
Careful.

01:11:01.458 --> 01:11:02.890
Hold it there.

01:11:05.729 --> 01:11:07.595
- It's done, give it a go.
- Yeah?

01:11:08.565 --> 01:11:10.798
Aww, beautiful.

01:11:12.636 --> 01:11:14.535
Ah, there you go, wonderful.

01:11:15.639 --> 01:11:16.938
Ah, that's nice.

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:20.608
A massage,
massage on your hand.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.610
There you go.

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:26.414
- Ready?
- Yeah. Hang on.

01:11:26.416 --> 01:11:27.482
I have to press those down.

01:11:31.021 --> 01:11:32.687
My pinky's gone in the poo.

01:11:33.723 --> 01:11:36.958
Okay. Yeah,
you get the idea, don't you?

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.360
Was brown
really my favorite color?

01:11:39.362 --> 01:11:41.863
Yeah, you said it was.

01:11:43.767 --> 01:11:45.500
I don't like brown anymore.

01:11:47.704 --> 01:11:49.871
Things change, don't they, eh?

01:11:50.674 --> 01:11:54.876
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:11:58.548 --> 01:12:01.015
Time for bed now, mate.
Get up on your feet, take your gown off, ok.

01:12:01.017 --> 01:12:01.949
Take this off.

01:12:04.954 --> 01:12:06.621
Wait, give it here, up you go.

01:12:07.724 --> 01:12:09.324
Okay, my darling boys.

01:12:12.362 --> 01:12:13.494
In you go.

01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:17.832
Good lad.

01:12:24.607 --> 01:12:25.940
Good boy.

01:12:25.942 --> 01:12:27.575
Acres and acres, boys.

01:12:27.577 --> 01:12:29.010
Acres and acres.

01:12:41.925 --> 01:12:44.525
- What?
- Something you might wanna see.

01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:46.728
Like what,
have you been going out on me?

01:12:47.597 --> 01:12:49.030
I better watch how much I drink.

01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:50.465
How do you mean, what?

01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:56.404
Oh, no, stop that.

01:12:57.574 --> 01:12:58.673
Are you sure?

01:12:59.409 --> 01:13:01.676
Yeah!

01:13:05.415 --> 01:13:06.914
Is that the line, family,
but you're supposed

01:13:06.916 --> 01:13:08.783
to do another one there, right?

01:13:08.785 --> 01:13:10.051
Oh, fuck, you done loads.

01:13:10.687 --> 01:13:12.653
I can't believe it.

01:13:12.655 --> 01:13:14.489
Oh, no, Katie.

01:13:14.491 --> 01:13:15.990
We're gonna be a family, Singe.

01:13:15.992 --> 01:13:17.024
Oh, no.

01:13:17.026 --> 01:13:18.860
We're gonna be complete.

01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:24.532

Oh, my darlin'.

01:13:41.518 --> 01:13:43.518
Hello, my gorgeous boy.

I've been wanting
to hold you for weeks.

01:13:47.891 --> 01:13:49.590
Weeks and weeks.

01:13:50.827 --> 01:13:52.627
Oh, my darlin'.

01:13:52.629 --> 01:13:53.795
Hello,
I've got someone else

01:13:53.797 --> 01:13:55.563
for you to hold as well.

01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:59.000
Do you want to
see the new baby?

01:14:00.069 --> 01:14:02.603
Go on, darling,
off you go with your mama.

01:14:06.843 --> 01:14:07.975

You know I can't,
I can't do that.

Read the rest of it.

01:15:12.842 --> 01:15:17.512
Somebody there for them
for when they just need to,

01:15:19.616 --> 01:15:20.548

How are you?

01:17:21.838 --> 01:17:23.170
Nice to see you.

01:17:26.075 --> 01:17:29.043
Hello, Mommy, how are you?

01:17:29.045 --> 01:17:30.678
- Nice to see you.
- Do you want a cuppa?

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.713
- Got any beers?
- Yes.

01:17:32.715 --> 01:17:33.948
I'm on holidays.

There you go. Straight into
the games, is it?

That's what I like to see.
Playtime.

01:17:42.392 --> 01:17:43.924
- I wanna be playing.
- You mind if I leave them with you just

01:17:43.926 --> 01:17:46.694
for a second while
I get the bags unpacked?

01:17:47.764 --> 01:17:49.163
<i>¶ Well I know, I know ¶</i>

01:17:49.165 --> 01:17:52.967

- We've got teas, guys.
- Here they come.

01:17:55.972 --> 01:17:57.104
- I'll take this one over.
- Yeah.

01:17:58.041 --> 01:17:59.440
- Here you go.
- Thank you, darling.

01:17:59.442 --> 01:18:00.741
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

01:18:00.743 --> 01:18:03.344
- Good, thank you.
- Yes.

01:18:03.346 --> 01:18:07.081
- Gorgeous day, isn't it?
- It's beautiful.

01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:10.184
- You alright, bro?
- What's happening, brother?

01:18:10.186 --> 01:18:12.019
- Wonderful day.
- Isn't it just?

01:18:12.021 --> 01:18:16.957
- Come on, go for a dip. Be like the Singe of old.
- What are you talking about?

01:18:16.959 --> 01:18:18.959
- Oh, go on.
- While the sun's out.

01:18:18.961 --> 01:18:20.061
It's nippy, mate.

01:18:20.063 --> 01:18:21.128
So what about the kids?

01:18:21.130 --> 01:18:22.730
They've got their swimmers.

01:18:22.732 --> 01:18:23.964
So what?

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:26.967
- Do you dare me?
- Yeah, there's no one about.

01:18:26.969 --> 01:18:30.438
- You're only among family.
- Yeah, but you haven't seen my body, darling.

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:33.307
Alright, bugger, I'm gonna!

01:18:33.943 --> 01:18:36.077
You're next.
- Alright, boys, check this out.

01:18:36.846 --> 01:18:40.081
Boys,
what is your dad doing?

01:18:40.083 --> 01:18:41.482
You alright?

01:18:44.287 --> 01:18:45.720
It's a bit nippy, mate.

01:18:47.757 --> 01:18:48.856
Alright.

01:18:49.759 --> 01:18:50.491
I love you all.

01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:52.827
See ya.

01:19:40.810 --> 01:19:43.277
- You alright, boy?
- Yeah, alright, Dad, yeah.

01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:44.278
I'm just...

01:19:47.884 --> 01:19:51.018
I just keep
seeing ghosts everywhere.

01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:53.454
Hmm...
Good ghosts.

01:20:05.935 --> 01:20:08.235
When your Mom and I
visited Kate one time

01:20:10.239 --> 01:20:12.540
there was an elderly lady
in for tests.

01:20:14.811 --> 01:20:18.078
Can't remember which hospital,
one of the many.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.380
And we got talking to her.

01:20:21.184 --> 01:20:23.818
And she told us
she'd lost her husband

01:20:25.354 --> 01:20:27.254
and now it was her turn.

01:20:28.991 --> 01:20:30.424
That's exactly how she put it.

01:20:31.994 --> 01:20:35.029
She wasn't scared. She knew
these were her last days.

01:20:36.532 --> 01:20:38.833
But she'd always been thankful

01:20:38.835 --> 01:20:40.334
for each and every one of them.

01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:47.041
Every morning is the beginning
of the rest of your life.

01:20:48.377 --> 01:20:50.244
- It's quite sweet.
- Yeah.

01:20:51.047 --> 01:20:52.246
That's what she said.

01:20:55.251 --> 01:20:57.017
Kate knew that, I think.

01:20:59.155 --> 01:21:00.387
Each day as it comes.

01:21:05.094 --> 01:21:07.161
So long as you make the most of

01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:11.932
every single damn minute of it.

01:21:17.039 --> 01:21:18.472
- You cold?
- No.

01:21:19.108 --> 01:21:24.144
- No, it's a beautiful evening.
- See you in a bit.

01:21:24.146 --> 01:21:26.380
Yeah, I'll just
stay here for a bit.

01:21:58.981 --> 01:22:02.216
Why don't you go home, Singe,
get some proper sleep?

01:22:03.152 --> 01:22:04.318
We've got your numbers.

01:22:27.310 --> 01:22:29.143
Acres and acres, my darling.

01:22:31.981 --> 01:22:33.447
Acres and acres.

01:22:35.017 --> 01:22:36.083
And acres.

01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:38.485
And acres.

01:25:41.303 --> 01:25:42.503
Hello?

01:26:08.931 --> 01:26:11.198
- Oh, God!
- Jane, it's time!

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:12.366
- Singe.
- Would you mind coming?

01:26:12.368 --> 01:26:14.535
- I'll be right over.
- Thanks.

01:27:24.573 --> 01:27:26.974
She's been holding on for you.

01:27:58.307 --> 01:28:00.741
What, crisps for the car?
Yeah, they're not on the list, are they?

01:28:00.743 --> 01:28:03.477
Cheese and onion, are you sure, mate?
Do you remember when you threw up in the car

01:28:03.479 --> 01:28:06.280
after you'd been eating them and your
sick smelled like cheese and onion crisps?

01:28:06.282 --> 01:28:08.448
- Some orange club biscuits.
- Orange club biscuits.

01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:12.386
- Yeah, that's it. Jam. Strawberry, please, my lord.
- Jam.

01:28:12.388 --> 01:28:15.422
- I found it.
- Ok, yeah, jelly, actually. Yeah, very good, well done.

01:28:15.424 --> 01:28:17.758
Alright, moving on,
what else do we need?

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:19.626
Uh, lemon curd,
back with the jams.

01:28:20.963 --> 01:28:22.963
Where is it, can you see it?

01:28:22.965 --> 01:28:25.065
Down there. Get it, nice one.

01:28:25.067 --> 01:28:30.070
- So, this is Mom's birthday?
- No, darling, it's Mother's Day

01:28:30.072 --> 01:28:33.407
and we're gonna celebrate it every year
'cause it's a very special day for us.

01:28:33.409 --> 01:28:36.343
Um, okay, wait up, lads.

01:28:36.345 --> 01:28:39.613
We've got, right, crisps,
popcorn, walnut whips.

01:28:39.615 --> 01:28:41.615
There's three on the list
and there's about 19 in here.

01:28:41.617 --> 01:28:43.050
- Did you do that?
- He did!

01:28:43.052 --> 01:28:44.384
- Did you?
- He did!

01:28:44.386 --> 01:28:46.353
- Maybe, no.
- Yeah, tell the truth.

01:28:46.355 --> 01:28:48.822
Alright, what else do we need?
No fighting, please, thank you.

01:28:49.892 --> 01:28:50.957
Oh, mate.

01:28:54.897 --> 01:28:59.032
Christ alive, I feel sick now.
Right.

01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:04.571
Before we're done let's have a toast, okay?
To Mom, get your little glass.

01:29:04.573 --> 01:29:09.743
Get your glass, put your glass up.
Right, and, um, Mom always used to say

01:29:09.745 --> 01:29:12.546
that you can never
um, laugh too much,

01:29:12.548 --> 01:29:14.681
you can never learn too much,
you can never care too much,

01:29:14.683 --> 01:29:16.883
you can never love too much.
So--

01:29:16.885 --> 01:29:20.754
But you can eat too much.
- Yeah, you can eat too much.

01:29:20.756 --> 01:29:23.423
Cheers, cheers.
Alright, down it, down it.

01:29:23.425 --> 01:29:25.092
No, don't down it
you'll be sick.

01:29:26.895 --> 01:29:28.628
- Oh! - Nice!
- So, yeah, there is a new table

01:29:28.630 --> 01:29:30.697
- and a new umbrella thing.
- Lovely table!

01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:32.466
It really cheers the place up.

01:29:32.468 --> 01:29:34.801
Now Daddy's allowed
a friend for tea.

01:29:34.803 --> 01:29:35.936
Just the one friend?

01:29:37.673 --> 01:29:40.474
'Cause I was thinking,
there's six chairs.

01:29:40.476 --> 01:29:44.911
So, if it were me,
Daddy and Finn,

01:29:44.913 --> 01:29:46.813
that would leave three extra.

01:29:46.815 --> 01:29:49.816
But if Mommy were here,
that would mean there's

01:29:49.818 --> 01:29:54.888
only two extra spaces left
for me and Finn's friends.

01:29:55.891 --> 01:29:58.759
But, now Mommy's gone,
she wanted us to have

01:29:58.761 --> 01:30:00.894
a big table so Daddy
can have a friend, too.

01:30:02.731 --> 01:30:04.931
- Sounds like you've got it all worked out!
- Yes.

01:30:08.003 --> 01:30:10.537
Oh, Andrea,
yeah, no, yeah, yeah!

01:30:10.539 --> 01:30:13.874
She was at your dinner thing,
wasn't she? No, she's nice.

01:30:13.876 --> 01:30:18.845
- She's okay if you ever wanna give her a call.
- Oh, really?

01:30:19.681 --> 01:30:21.882
Yeah, as in,
when you wanna get out there.

01:30:21.884 --> 01:30:23.650
Have a drink or a meal.

01:30:24.586 --> 01:30:25.786
Yeah, she's up for it.

01:30:28.824 --> 01:30:31.191
So, shall I give you her number?

01:30:34.496 --> 01:30:36.196
It's just a date, Singe.

01:30:36.198 --> 01:30:38.632
Just,
it's not a marriage proposal.

01:30:38.634 --> 01:30:40.634
It's just getting used to
going out with a woman again.

01:30:40.636 --> 01:30:42.436
I know, I know, it's just that,

01:30:43.071 --> 01:30:44.938
I haven't been single
since I was 13.

01:30:46.842 --> 01:30:48.842
You know, I'm a
little bit out of practice.

01:30:50.979 --> 01:30:52.212
Okay.

01:30:52.214 --> 01:30:53.146
Okay.

01:30:53.982 --> 01:30:55.048
- But?
- But?

01:30:56.051 --> 01:30:56.983
- So?
- So?

01:31:00.889 --> 01:31:03.123
Look, it's like you say,
it's as in when, isn't it?

01:31:03.125 --> 01:31:04.057
You know?

01:31:05.093 --> 01:31:06.993
I'll hold you to that.

01:31:09.465 --> 01:31:11.465
Don't doubt it, mate.

01:31:34.656 --> 01:31:38.191
It's all clear, Singe, the scan.

01:31:40.128 --> 01:31:41.595
It's all clear.

01:31:42.831 --> 01:31:44.831
Your son's in full remission.

01:32:07.122 --> 01:32:11.658
Right, okay, you lot, we're gonna take a photograph of everyone.
All of us around Reef.

01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:15.762
So if I could get my two sisters,
Kay and Luce, down in the front with me.

01:32:15.764 --> 01:32:19.799
My two lovely moms.
If you go over to the side, yeah, that's it, perfect.

01:32:19.801 --> 01:32:23.970
- Yeah, thanks very much. And the boys at the front, yeah.
- Singe!

01:32:23.972 --> 01:32:26.907
- How many you had, Nige? I want your hands where I can see 'em.
- Okay, Singe?

01:32:26.909 --> 01:32:28.942
- You don't wanna repeat your Christmas-- Yeah?
- You get in the photo,

01:32:28.944 --> 01:32:31.011
- I'll take it.
- No, that's alright, darling, I've got the timer.

01:32:31.013 --> 01:32:33.280
- Oh, okay! Then I'll get in it?
- Alright, pop yourself in.

01:32:33.282 --> 01:32:36.182
Yeah, you, of course, yeah.
Ten seconds from--

01:32:36.184 --> 01:32:37.817
- Right, come on, Singe!
- Now!

01:32:37.819 --> 01:32:40.053
- You're gonna miss it!
- Come on!

01:32:40.055 --> 01:32:41.755
Sorry, I don't know
if it's gone off.

01:32:41.757 --> 01:32:44.124
Yeah, it's going, it's going!

01:32:44.126 --> 01:32:46.960
- Five, four--
- It's not New Year's Eve!

01:32:46.962 --> 01:32:50.163
Three, two, one!
To Reef!

01:32:50.165 --> 01:32:51.865
Hold it there.

01:32:51.867 --> 01:32:54.000
- I don't think it's gone off.
- No, it didn't.

01:32:54.002 --> 01:32:56.102
- It stopped flashing, though.
- I think I heard it.

01:33:07.182 --> 01:33:10.317
I can see her!
I can see where she is!

01:33:10.319 --> 01:33:12.919
- Hi, Mom!
- Hi, Mom!

01:33:12.921 --> 01:33:14.154
Daddy, say hi to Mom!

01:33:14.156 --> 01:33:15.956
Acres and acres, darling!

01:33:16.725 --> 01:33:18.358
Acres and acres!

01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:20.260
Acres and acres!

01:34:00.769 --> 01:34:01.801
Miss you so much.

01:34:03.705 --> 01:34:05.372
But I'm doing alright,
I'm doing okay, you know.

01:34:05.374 --> 01:34:10.243
It's like, it's like, um
it's like time has been working

01:34:10.245 --> 01:34:13.813
its way under my skin and,
uh, without me knowing it,

01:34:13.815 --> 01:34:16.116
and fixing cuts and
mending bruises and stuff.

01:34:20.188 --> 01:34:22.856
I just can't get my head around how much things have changed,
you know.

01:34:28.163 --> 01:34:32.699
But maybe that's not time, maybe that's you,
maybe that's you doing that.

01:34:38.907 --> 01:34:39.839
I promise you

01:34:42.911 --> 01:34:45.311
that whatever
life throws at us and me

01:34:46.181 --> 01:34:47.814
that I will explore,

01:34:50.852 --> 01:34:53.019
just like you always said.

01:34:55.223 --> 01:34:58.158
'Cause life's been good before
and it will be good again.

01:35:02.764 --> 01:35:05.432
And I will make the most
of every moment.

01:35:06.935 --> 01:35:07.967
For the boys.

01:35:12.474 --> 01:35:14.774
So, are we at the, as in when?

01:35:17.779 --> 01:35:19.779
I don't know.
I honestly don't know.

01:35:24.119 --> 01:35:25.051
Stop it.

01:35:27.389 --> 01:35:30.090
Well, that's life's
big adventure, isn't it?

01:35:30.092 --> 01:35:31.825
- Nothing more nor less.
- No.

01:35:33.328 --> 01:35:34.728
- Singe?
- Hmm?

01:35:36.465 --> 01:35:37.831
You're gonna be fine.

01:35:53.315 --> 01:35:54.180
Hello?

01:35:54.182 --> 01:35:55.949
Hi, is it Andrea?

01:35:56.952 --> 01:36:00.153
It's, uh, yeah, it is, yeah.

01:36:00.155 --> 01:36:01.087
How'd you know?

01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:02.922
Oh, did she?

01:36:04.459 --> 01:36:06.159
When did she get--

01:36:06.161 --> 01:36:07.227
Oh, okay.

01:36:08.930 --> 01:36:10.430
Well, that's pretty
cheeky of her.

01:36:24.946 --> 01:36:26.846
You wanna do it?

01:36:26.848 --> 01:36:28.014
It's not yours.

01:36:28.016 --> 01:36:28.948
Alright?

01:36:29.985 --> 01:36:31.518
How do I look?

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:34.187
- Uh, nice?
- Handsome.

01:36:34.189 --> 01:36:37.023
Well, thank you. What?

01:36:38.293 --> 01:36:40.226
- The tie.
- You don't like it?

01:36:40.228 --> 01:36:42.395
- You don't need it.
- It's a bit corporate, isn't it?

01:36:42.397 --> 01:36:44.097
Like a geography teacher.

01:36:44.099 --> 01:36:45.231
Geography teacher?

01:36:45.233 --> 01:36:46.499
That's a bit strong.

01:36:46.501 --> 01:36:48.168
Should I get it off?

01:36:48.170 --> 01:36:49.102
Okay.

01:36:50.305 --> 01:36:52.305
I'll undo a button, though,
'cause I don't

01:36:52.307 --> 01:36:54.474
wanna go all like,
you know what I mean.

01:36:55.043 --> 01:36:56.242
Is that better?

01:36:56.244 --> 01:36:57.243
Better.

01:36:57.479 --> 01:36:58.578
Alright, thank you.

01:37:00.448 --> 01:37:01.047
Enjoy.

01:37:27.108 --> 01:37:28.041
Okay.

01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:50.129
<i>¶ Can't believe how much has</i>
<i>Changed in only half a year ¶</i>

01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:56.970
