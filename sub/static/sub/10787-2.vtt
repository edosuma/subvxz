WEBVTT

00:03.083 --> 00:04.417
Pacey: YOU KNOW,
THEY WANT TO SEE ME

00:04.417 --> 00:05.750
IN THE GUIDANCE
OFFICE AFTER SCHOOL.

00:05.750 --> 00:06.834
Joey: SO?

00:06.834 --> 00:08.000
SO, DO THEY WANT
TO SEE YOU

00:08.000 --> 00:08.583
IN THE GUIDANCE
OFFICE AFTER SCHOOL?

00:08.583 --> 00:10.834
NO.
NO.

00:10.834 --> 00:12.250
SEE, THAT
RIGHT THERE
IS A BAD SIGN.

00:12.250 --> 00:14.125
IT MEANS THEY'RE
SINGLING ME OUT
ALREADY.

00:14.125 --> 00:15.834
AW, DON'T WORRY,
SWEETIE.

00:15.834 --> 00:17.375
THEY PROBABLY WANT
TO EXTEND A HAND

00:17.375 --> 00:19.000
AND LET YOU KNOW THAT
THEY'RE THERE TO HELP YOU

00:19.000 --> 00:21.667
FULFILL YOUR DESTINY
AS THE WORLD'S GREATEST
GAS STATION ATTENDANT.

00:21.667 --> 00:22.875
OH, THAT'S CUTE.

00:22.875 --> 00:24.166
WHAT, SUDDENLY TEASING'S
OUT OF THE QUESTION?

00:24.166 --> 00:26.875
OH, NO, TEASE AWAY,
YOU LITTLE HUSSY.

00:26.875 --> 00:28.542
BUT YOU DO RAISE
AN INTERESTING
POINT.

00:28.542 --> 00:29.375
I THINK WE SHOULD
TALK ABOUT IT,

00:29.375 --> 00:31.000
NOW THAT WE'RE BACK
TO SCHOOL.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.500
TALK ABOUT WHAT,
EXACTLY?

00:33.500 --> 00:35.750
WELL, UH,
MUTUAL WANTS
AND NEEDS.

00:35.750 --> 00:38.500
DID YOU ACTUALLY
JUST SAY THAT OUT LOUD?

00:38.500 --> 00:40.542
LIKE YOU SAID,
WE'RE A COUPLE NOW,
POTTER.

00:40.542 --> 00:41.792
AND, AS A COUPLE,
I THINK THERE'S

00:41.792 --> 00:42.583
A COUPLE THINGS
WE NEED TO DISCUSS.

00:42.583 --> 00:44.917
SUCH AS?

00:45.708 --> 00:47.542
KISSING IN
PUBLIC.

00:47.542 --> 00:49.208
MAYBE.

00:49.208 --> 00:50.583
MAYBE?

00:50.583 --> 00:52.500
WELL, IF IT'S
OF THE SPONTANEOUS VARIETY.

00:52.500 --> 00:53.875
GOOD LORD, WOMAN,

00:53.875 --> 00:55.917
YOU REALLY ARE
A FICKLE MISTRESS,
YOU KNOW THAT?

00:55.917 --> 00:57.041
I MEAN,
WITHOUT KISSING,

00:57.041 --> 00:59.542
WHAT DO WE REALLY
HAVE LEFT?

00:59.542 --> 01:01.750
PRECIOUS LITTLE.

01:01.750 --> 01:03.458
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
BREAK UP.

01:03.458 --> 01:04.834
YEAH, WELL, WE HAD
A GOOD RUN, HUH?

01:04.834 --> 01:06.250
MM-HMM.

01:16.667 --> 01:18.458
EXCUSE ME.

02:14.875 --> 02:16.250
Andie: WOW. SENIOR YEAR.

02:16.250 --> 02:18.834
THEN, BEFORE YOU YOU KNOW IT,
COLLEGE.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.083
WELL, IF I DON'T
FIND A JOB SOON,

02:20.083 --> 02:23.959
THE ONLY THING I HAVE
TO LOOK FORWARD TO
IS C.C.C.

02:23.959 --> 02:26.166
CAPESIDE COMMUNITY
COLLEGE.

02:26.166 --> 02:27.333
OH.

02:27.333 --> 02:30.625
HEY, WELL, THERE'S
ALWAYS C.Y.C.

02:30.625 --> 02:31.875
WHAT'S THAT?

02:31.875 --> 02:33.000
CAPESIDE YACHT CLUB.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.500
MY FATHER WAS
JUST TELLING ME

02:34.500 --> 02:35.917
THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR A WAITRESS.

02:35.917 --> 02:37.166
YOU'RE HIGH.

02:37.166 --> 02:40.000
HA! JOEY, COME ON,
IT'S THE ICE HOUSE

02:40.000 --> 02:42.458
WITH CUTE RICH BOYS
AND WAY BIGGER TIPS.

02:42.458 --> 02:44.458
YEAH, AND SOMETHING TELLS ME
THAT THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE

02:44.458 --> 02:45.500
WOULD PROBABLY FROWN
UPON THE APPLICANT

02:45.500 --> 02:48.291
WHOSE FAMILY NAME IS
SYNONYMOUS WITH SCANDAL.

02:48.291 --> 02:50.166
SO MAKE LIKE YOU'RE
ONE OF THEM.

02:50.166 --> 02:52.959
YEAH, RIGHT.

02:52.959 --> 02:54.834
OK, HERE'S WHAT
YOU DO.

02:54.834 --> 02:55.834
IF YOU THINK
THE INTERVIEW'S

02:55.834 --> 02:58.542
STARTING
TO GO SOUTH,
YOU DROP A NAME.

02:58.542 --> 03:00.166
WHOSE?

03:00.166 --> 03:03.000
HMM, WELL,
I WOULD SAY YOU
COULD USE MINE,

03:03.000 --> 03:05.417
BUT, HEH, THESE DAYS
McPHEE IS SYNONYMOUS

03:05.417 --> 03:08.542
WITH GAY, CRAZY,
AND DYSFUNCTIONAL.

03:08.542 --> 03:10.875
HEY, HOW ABOUT
THE ROSSES? THEY'RE
ON THE BOARD.

03:10.875 --> 03:14.250
CHARLES, KATE,
AND SON OWEN.

03:14.250 --> 03:17.708
OH, MY GOD,
HE IS SO GORGEOUS,

03:17.708 --> 03:20.625
SO OUR AGE,
AND SO ELIGIBLE.

03:20.625 --> 03:22.500
OH, AND SO
PERFECT FOR ME

03:22.500 --> 03:24.000
IF I ACTUALLY CARED
ABOUT THOSE THINGS.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
AH, BUT YOU DIGRESS.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.208
OK, SO, ANYWAY,
JOEY, WHERE ELSE

03:27.208 --> 03:29.625
ARE YOU GONNA MAKE
THAT KIND OF MONEY?

03:32.500 --> 03:34.125
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THERE IS ALWAYS

03:34.125 --> 03:35.667
THAT STRIP CLUB
ON THE EDGE OF TOWN.

03:39.875 --> 03:42.041
DAWSON LEERY.

03:42.041 --> 03:43.625
GRETCHEN, HEY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:43.625 --> 03:46.542
OH, SCOUTING OUT
SOME NEW DIGS.

03:46.542 --> 03:47.667
MM-HMM.

03:47.667 --> 03:49.834
UNTIL MY BROTHER
DOUGLAS FINDS
A SUITABLE--

03:49.834 --> 03:52.000
AND I FINGER-QUOTE
"PARTNER"--

03:52.000 --> 03:53.500
HE'S BEST OFF LIVING
BY HIS LONESOME.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.208
SO LOOKS LIKE I'M
GONNA BE SHACKING UP

03:56.208 --> 03:57.708
WITH MY OTHER
EQUALLY IRRITATING

03:57.708 --> 04:00.708
YET DECIDEDLY
LESS ANAL BROTHER.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.041
THAT'S GREAT.

04:02.041 --> 04:05.500
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

04:05.500 --> 04:08.959
LISTEN, THIS IS,
OF COURSE,
NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

04:08.959 --> 04:12.458
BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW MUCH IT
BREAKS MY HEART

04:12.458 --> 04:15.250
TO SEE ONCE INSEPARABLE
BEST FRIENDS
SO ESTRANGED.

04:15.250 --> 04:16.500
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
THAT I CAN DO...

04:18.583 --> 04:21.791
CLEARLY SOMETHING YOU'D
RATHER NOT TALK ABOUT.

04:22.291 --> 04:24.333
SORRY. MY BAD.

04:24.333 --> 04:26.125
WELL, IT'S OK.

04:26.125 --> 04:27.917
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT?

04:27.917 --> 04:32.708
DAWSON, THIS IS
THE MOST OFFENSIVE COLLECTION
OF MUSIC I'VE EVER SEEN.

04:32.708 --> 04:34.583
PRECISELY. WHICH IS WHY
I'M TRADING THEM IN.

04:34.583 --> 04:36.750
YEAH, BUT, DAWSON,
VANILLA ICE?

04:36.750 --> 04:38.083
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

04:38.083 --> 04:40.333
I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS 10!

04:40.333 --> 04:41.750
WHO HAS GOOD TASTE
IN MUSIC
WHEN THEY'RE 10?

04:41.750 --> 04:43.542
BY THE TIME I WAS 10,
I COULD RATTLE OFF

04:43.542 --> 04:46.083
THE NAME OF EVERY BAND
ON THE SUB-POP LABEL,

04:46.083 --> 04:47.792
AND I WAS TELLING
ANYBODY WHO WOULD LISTEN

04:47.792 --> 04:49.208
THAT A GUY NAMED KURT COBAIN
WAS ABOUT TO CHANGE

04:49.208 --> 04:51.208
THE FACE OF MUSIC
AS WE KNEW IT.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.500
AND BY THE TIME
I WAS 10,

04:52.500 --> 04:53.417
I COULD RATTLE OFF
THE NAME OF EVERY
CINEMATOGRAPHER

04:53.417 --> 04:57.083
STEVEN SPIELBERG
EVER WORKED WITH.

04:57.083 --> 05:00.166
WHICH SOMEHOW ISN'T
THAT IMPRESSIVE,
IS IT?

05:00.166 --> 05:02.291
OK, WHAT ELSE
DO WE HAVE HERE?

05:02.291 --> 05:04.750
OK, THE GRATEFUL DEAD.

05:04.750 --> 05:07.792
NOW, WHY--WHY ARE YOU
RETURNING THIS?

05:07.792 --> 05:10.542
MY PARENTS GOT ME
THAT CD. I JUST...

05:10.542 --> 05:10.959
WASN'T A BIG FAN.

05:10.959 --> 05:14.333
OK, OK.

05:14.333 --> 05:17.750
I CAN'T BELIEVE I AM
STANDING IN FRONT
OF A TEENAGE GUY

05:17.750 --> 05:20.208
WHOSE PARENTS HAVE
BETTER TASTE IN MUSIC
THAN HE DOES.

05:20.208 --> 05:21.708
SHAME ON YOU, DAWSON.

05:21.708 --> 05:23.667
SHAME ON YOU.

05:29.083 --> 05:31.792
YOU GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME.

05:31.792 --> 05:33.083
THAT'S LIKE
THE UMPTEENTH TIME
TODAY

05:33.083 --> 05:34.083
YOU'VE CHECKED
YOUR E-MAIL.

05:34.083 --> 05:35.083
YOU LIE.
THANK YOU.

05:35.083 --> 05:37.375
I DON'T KNOW...

05:37.375 --> 05:39.250
EVERY TIME I WENT BY
THE COMPUTER LAB TODAY,

05:39.250 --> 05:42.166
I SAW THE SAME
BOSOMY BLONDE BEHIND
THE SAME BLUEBERRY IMAC.

05:42.166 --> 05:44.250
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

05:44.250 --> 05:47.000
I ADMIT IT,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.208
JACK, I THINK IT'S CLEAR
THAT HENRY HAS FORSAKEN ME
FOR ANOTHER.

05:51.208 --> 05:55.667
GIVE THE POOR GUY
SOME TIME
TO GET ACCLIMATED.

05:55.667 --> 05:56.458
I DON'T KNOW,
I MEAN, IT'S WEIRD.

05:56.458 --> 05:59.500
IT'S--IT'S BECOMING
A THING.

06:01.333 --> 06:02.417
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
A THING?

06:02.417 --> 06:03.875
A THING,
AN ALARMING TREND.

06:03.875 --> 06:07.500
I MEAN, ALL SUMMER LONG
THERE WERE PHONE CALLS,
E-MAILS,

06:07.500 --> 06:09.417
IM'ing EACH OTHER
TO THE POINT
OF EXHAUSTION,

06:09.417 --> 06:12.625
BUT NOW WHEN I GO ONLINE
HE'S NEVER THERE,

06:12.625 --> 06:15.500
AND WHEN I CALL HE'S
STRANGELY UNAVAILABLE.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.291
I MEAN, I'M STARTING
TO FEEL LIKE I DID
SOMETHING WRONG.

06:18.291 --> 06:22.291
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT
I'M NOT A VERY GOOD
CYBERSEX PARTNER?

06:22.291 --> 06:25.208
I'M SURE YOU'RE A VERY
GENEROUS AND GIVING
CYBER-LOVER, JEN.

06:25.208 --> 06:27.083
Computer: YOU'VE GOT MAIL!

06:27.083 --> 06:29.875
WHO WROTE YOU?

06:31.625 --> 06:33.458
UM...

06:35.041 --> 06:35.583
NO ONE.

06:46.375 --> 06:51.250
NOW, WHAT EXACTLY
IS AN ICE HOUSE?

06:52.625 --> 06:53.792
IT'S A RESTAURANT.

06:53.792 --> 06:55.792
UM, WELL,
IT BURNED DOWN LAST YEAR.

06:55.792 --> 06:58.917
OH, HOW UNFORTUNATE.

06:58.917 --> 07:02.625
SOUNDS LIKE
A CHARMING LITTLE JOINT.

07:02.625 --> 07:04.708
WELL, DADDY, YOU KNOW,
HE THOUGHT IT WAS
A GOOD IDEA

07:04.708 --> 07:06.458
FOR ME TO GET OUT THERE
AND MINGLE WITH
THE LITTLE PEOPLE.

07:06.458 --> 07:09.083
AND WHAT DOES DADDY DO,
DEAR?

07:09.083 --> 07:12.041
PHARMACEUTICALS.

07:12.041 --> 07:13.583
DADDY MADE HIS FORTUNE
IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL
WORLD.

07:13.583 --> 07:16.750
OH, WELL, THEN,
WHY IS IT, I WONDER,

07:16.750 --> 07:21.083
THAT I DON'T SEE
THE POTTER NAME
ON OUR ROSTER?

07:23.542 --> 07:26.125
I GUESS WE'RE
JUST NOT MUCH
OF THE JOINING KIND.

07:26.125 --> 07:27.417
WHERE DO YOU SUMMER, THEN?

07:27.417 --> 07:29.250
I SPENT MY SUMMER
SAILING, ACTUALLY.

07:29.250 --> 07:31.000
OH, WELL,
THAT SOUNDS LOVELY.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.417
I HAVE TO ASK:

07:33.417 --> 07:35.917
WERE YOU A DECK HAND
OR A STOWAWAY?

07:40.625 --> 07:41.583
EXCUSE ME,

07:41.583 --> 07:43.333
BUT, UM,
BEFORE I SUBMIT

07:43.333 --> 07:45.792
TO ANOTHER SECOND
OF YOUR THINLY
VEILED BITCHERY,

07:45.792 --> 07:47.792
DO YOU NEED
A WAITRESS OR NOT?

07:47.792 --> 07:50.917
HMM. YES,
NOW THAT I RECALL,

07:50.917 --> 07:53.333
THAT POSITION'S ALREADY
BEEN FILLED.

07:53.333 --> 07:54.458
TERRIFIC.

07:54.458 --> 07:56.667
OH, BY THE WAY,
I'LL BE SURE TO TELL

07:56.667 --> 07:57.125
THE ROSSES THAT
YOU SAID HELLO.

07:57.125 --> 07:59.792
EXCUSE ME.

07:59.792 --> 08:00.959
YOU KNOW
THE ROSSES?

08:00.959 --> 08:01.500
CHARLIE, KATE, AND OWEN?

08:01.500 --> 08:03.667
OH, FROM WAY BACK.

08:03.667 --> 08:05.917
HOW DO YOU THINK I HEARD
ABOUT THIS POSITION?

08:05.917 --> 08:07.458
THEY'RE ON THE BOARD HERE,
AREN'T THEY?

08:07.458 --> 08:09.291
OH, MISS POTTER,

08:09.291 --> 08:12.125
I THINK PERHAPS...

08:12.125 --> 08:14.458
YOU AND I GOT OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT.

08:14.458 --> 08:16.542
PLEASE.

08:20.792 --> 08:25.458
HEY THERE,
MITCH...STER LEERY.

08:25.458 --> 08:27.542
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

08:27.542 --> 08:28.917
JUST, UH, FILLING IN

08:28.917 --> 08:30.834
UNTIL THEY FIND
A NEW GUIDANCE COUNSELOR.

08:30.834 --> 08:33.667
WHAT'D THEY DO
WITH THE OLD
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR?

08:33.667 --> 08:37.000
RIGHT. YOU MEAN THE ONE
WHO REFERRED TO YOU
FONDLY AS,

08:37.000 --> 08:40.707
AND I QUOTE, "ONE OF THE MOST
AGGRESSIVELY MEDIOCRE STUDENTS

08:40.707 --> 08:44.291
EVER TO GALUMPH HIS WAY THROUGH
THE HALLS AT CAPESIDE HIGH."

08:44.291 --> 08:45.291
POOR MAN WAS HEARD
MUTTERING YOUR NAME

08:45.291 --> 08:47.375
AS HE STUMBLED OFF
INTO EARLY RETIREMENT.

08:47.375 --> 08:48.834
POOR GUY.

08:48.834 --> 08:51.166
SO, WHY DOES THIS
BRING ME HERE?

08:51.166 --> 08:52.834
OK, SO, HERE'S THE DEAL.

08:52.834 --> 08:56.667
THEY HAVE DUMPED SOME OF
THE SPECIAL SCHEDULING
CASES INTO MY LAP.

08:56.667 --> 08:58.625
WHAT'S SO SPECIAL
ABOUT ME?

08:58.625 --> 09:00.000
APART FROM THE OBVIOUS,
OF COURSE.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.500
WELL, FOR STARTERS,
YOU SEEM TO LACK

09:02.500 --> 09:04.166
A CERTAIN AMOUNT
OF CLASSIFICATION
AT THE MOMENT.

09:04.166 --> 09:07.583
AND YOU SEEM TO LACK
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CLARITY
AT THE MOMENT.

09:07.583 --> 09:09.792
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
THIS SUMMER?

09:09.792 --> 09:12.458
NOTHING. I WENT SAILING.

09:12.458 --> 09:16.834
RIGHT. BUT, UM, WELL,
FROM THE LOOK OF THINGS,

09:16.834 --> 09:17.583
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

09:17.583 --> 09:19.333
AND WHERE IS
THAT EXACTLY?

09:19.333 --> 09:20.959
RIGHT HERE.
HERE?

09:20.959 --> 09:22.917
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN
IN SUMMER SCHOOL,
PACEY.

09:22.917 --> 09:26.834
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A TERRIBLE WAY
TO SPEND THE SUMMER.

09:26.834 --> 09:28.917
TELL ME SOMETHING.

09:28.917 --> 09:32.166
BEFORE YOU TOOK OFF,
DID YOU HAPPEN TO, OH,

09:32.166 --> 09:33.542
LOOK AT YOUR
REPORT CARD?

09:33.542 --> 09:36.041
I TOOK OFF A COUPLE OF DAYS
AFTER SCHOOL LET OUT.

09:36.041 --> 09:38.708
WELL, YOU KNOW,
HAD YOU LOOKED,
YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED

09:38.708 --> 09:42.083
THAT YOU FLUNKED
SCIENCE, HISTORY,
AND ENGLISH.

09:42.083 --> 09:42.875
3 BIGGIES, PACEY.

09:46.083 --> 09:48.458
WELL, THAT SUCKS.

09:50.542 --> 09:56.583
LOOK, PACEY, I DON'T,
UH, REALLY KNOW HOW
TO DO THIS, EXACTLY.

09:56.583 --> 09:59.917
I'VE HAD THE DISTINCT
PLEASURE OF WATCHING YOU
GROW UP.

09:59.917 --> 10:01.667
YOU CERTAINLY ARE ONE
OF THE MOST ENDEARING
PESTS I'VE EVER MET.

10:01.667 --> 10:02.959
BUT I'M NOT
YOUR TEACHER, OK?

10:02.959 --> 10:06.542
I'M NOT YOUR
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR.
I'M JUST YOUR FRIEND.

10:06.542 --> 10:09.166
SO, HELP ME OUT HERE,
OK?

10:09.166 --> 10:11.583
I MEAN, CUT THE GLIBNESS
AND JUST LISTEN TO ME
FOR A SECOND?

10:11.583 --> 10:15.667
YOU'RE IN DEEP TROUBLE
HERE.

10:15.667 --> 10:17.125
SO WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT?

10:17.125 --> 10:18.875
YOU CAN TAKE
THESE CLASSES OVER.

10:18.875 --> 10:20.291
WHEN?

10:20.291 --> 10:22.250
EVERY DAY, AFTER SCHOOL.

10:22.250 --> 10:23.583
WELL, I WAS GONNA
GET A JOB.

10:23.583 --> 10:25.208
I KIND OF NEED THE MONEY,
YOU KNOW?

10:25.208 --> 10:27.041
NO, I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
UNDERSTANDING ME, PACEY.

10:27.041 --> 10:29.000
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO WORK YOUR ASS OFF
THIS YEAR.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.291
AND WHAT IF I CAN'T DO IT?

10:30.291 --> 10:32.125
NO, YOU CAN.
YOU JUST FOCUS.

10:32.125 --> 10:35.417
BUT WHAT IF
I ACTUALLY CAN'T?

10:40.625 --> 10:42.917
WELL, THEN,
COME THIS MAY,

10:42.917 --> 10:45.125
YOU'RE GONNA
WATCH YOUR FRIENDS
GRADUATE WITHOUT YOU,

10:45.125 --> 10:48.917
START THEIR LIVES
WITHOUT YOU.

10:48.917 --> 10:52.041
THEY'LL BE HEADING OFF
FOR HIGHER EDUCATION,

10:52.041 --> 10:56.166
AND YOU'LL BE GEARING UP
FOR ANOTHER YEAR
AT CAPESIDE HIGH.

10:56.166 --> 10:57.834
HOW'S THAT SOUND, PACEY?

11:08.583 --> 11:09.834
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

11:09.834 --> 11:11.333
I THINK I HATE IT.

11:11.333 --> 11:13.166
WELL, I THINK
IT'S CHARMING.

11:13.166 --> 11:14.583
CHARMING? IT'S
LIKE SOMETHING

11:14.583 --> 11:16.333
OUT OF BETTER
HOMES & CRAP.

11:16.333 --> 11:19.417
OK, YOU SEE CRAP,
I SEE POTENTIAL.

11:19.417 --> 11:21.333
WELL, NO, I SEE
POTENTIAL, TOO.

11:21.333 --> 11:22.375
I SEE THE POTENTIAL
FOR RATS

11:22.375 --> 11:23.750
TO GNAW AT OUR EXTREMITIES
WHILE WE SLEEP.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.000
IT NEEDS BUT A FRESH
COAT OF PAINT

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
AND A WOMAN'S TOUCH.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.250
MM-HMM.

11:29.250 --> 11:30.667
AND ALL WE NEED TO DO
IS GET THE WORD OUT

11:30.667 --> 11:31.834
THAT THE LOCAL CRACK DEN
HAS SHUT DOWN.

11:31.834 --> 11:35.166
WHY ARE YOU BEING
SUCH A NAYSAYER?

11:35.166 --> 11:35.875
BECAUSE IT BECOMES ME.

11:35.875 --> 11:38.375
OK, FACE FACTS,
PACEY.

11:38.375 --> 11:39.333
WE DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF MONEY.

11:39.333 --> 11:41.542
SO THAT KILLER CONDO

11:41.542 --> 11:42.625
THAT YOU HAD
YOUR EYE ON

11:42.625 --> 11:44.875
IS PRETTY MUCH
OUT OF THE QUESTION.

11:44.875 --> 11:46.333
BUT THIS PLACE,

11:46.333 --> 11:49.041
WHILE LACKING
IN MANY CREATURE
COMFORTS,

11:49.041 --> 11:52.041
IS TOTALLY WITHIN
OUR BUDGETARY
LIMITATIONS.

11:52.041 --> 11:54.166
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS?

11:54.166 --> 11:55.250
WELL, I'M GUESSING
IT MEANS WE GET

11:55.250 --> 11:57.500
TO SPLIT THE UTILITIES
WITH THE COCKROACHES.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.917
NO. IT MEANS WE
ARE GOING TO TURN

11:59.917 --> 12:01.959
THIS PLACE
INTO A HOME, PACEY.

12:01.959 --> 12:03.208
I PROMISE.

12:03.208 --> 12:04.917
YEAH, AND UNTIL THEN,
WE JUST HAVE TO

12:04.917 --> 12:07.000
GET USED TO BRUSHING OUR TEETH
WITH BROWN WATER.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.291
OK, YOU SEEM TO HAVE

12:09.291 --> 12:10.708
A PARTICULARLY
NASTY CASE

12:10.708 --> 12:12.208
OF "FIRST DAY
AT SCHOOL."

12:12.208 --> 12:14.875
DOES SENIOR STATUS
NOT BRING YOU ANY
JOY WHATSOEVER?

12:14.875 --> 12:16.875
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY
YOU SHOULD MENTION THAT,

12:16.875 --> 12:20.542
'CAUSE IT TURNS OUT,
I'M NOT EXACTLY A SENIOR.

12:20.542 --> 12:23.375
OH, YEAH? THEN WHAT
EXACTLY ARE YOU?

12:23.375 --> 12:26.333
WELL, I'M SCREWED.

12:26.333 --> 12:28.834
I'M TOTALLY SCREWED.

12:28.834 --> 12:30.750
OK, ELABORATE.

12:33.667 --> 12:35.041
WELL...

12:35.041 --> 12:37.375
IT SEEMS AS THOUGH
I MANAGED TO FAIL

12:37.375 --> 12:39.625
3 CLASSES LAST YEAR.

12:39.625 --> 12:42.166
YEAH. 3. YOU KNOW,

12:42.166 --> 12:44.291
SO NOW I GOTTA
RETAKE THOSE
3 CLASSES

12:44.291 --> 12:46.041
AND PASS ALL OF THIS
YEAR'S CLASSES

12:46.041 --> 12:48.875
IF I WANNA
HAVE ANY HOPE
OF GRADUATING.

12:51.250 --> 12:53.375
OK. UM...

12:53.375 --> 12:55.500
OK, SO YOU DO IT.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.250
YOU KNOW, Y-YOU WORK
REALLY HARD THIS YEAR,

12:57.250 --> 12:59.959
AND YOU DO IT.
IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

13:01.250 --> 13:03.583
WHAT DOES JOEY THINK?

13:03.583 --> 13:06.125
YOU HAVEN'T
TOLD HER? WHY?

13:06.125 --> 13:08.417
BECAUSE JOEY
IS SMART,

13:08.417 --> 13:09.417
BUT PACEY
IS AN IDIOT,

13:09.417 --> 13:11.041
AND I'M TRYING NOT
TO MAKE HER ANY MORE

13:11.041 --> 13:12.750
AWARE OF THAT FACT
THAN SHE ALREADY IS.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.792
YOU ARE NOT
AN IDIOT, PACEY.

13:14.792 --> 13:15.834
AND SOMETHING TELLS ME
THAT JOEY'S FEELINGS FOR YOU

13:15.834 --> 13:20.250
ARE NOT CONTINGENT
ON YOUR GPA.

13:20.250 --> 13:23.125
LISTEN, I CAN
STAND HERE AND TELL YOU

13:23.125 --> 13:25.000
THAT EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE OK,

13:25.000 --> 13:27.208
BUT IT'S GONNA SOUND
A LOT BETTER
COMING FROM HER.

13:27.208 --> 13:29.208
SO TELL HER, OK?

13:36.458 --> 13:37.708
[CLATTER]

13:37.708 --> 13:39.625
EXCUSE ME.

13:40.792 --> 13:42.083
EXCUSE ME?

13:42.083 --> 13:43.250
MAY I HELP YOU?

13:43.250 --> 13:44.792
THAT'S UP
FOR DEBATE ACTUALLY.

13:44.792 --> 13:45.917
WELL, AS YOU CAN SEE
I DON'T REALLY HAVE

13:45.917 --> 13:47.542
A LOT OF TIME FOR
VERBAL PING-PONG.

13:47.542 --> 13:49.583
HALF AN HOUR AGO,
I DROPPED DOWN
ON ONE KNEE

13:49.583 --> 13:52.708
AND BEGGED YOU
FOR AN ICED TEA
AND A CLUB SANDWICH.

13:53.500 --> 13:57.166
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I AM SO SORRY.

13:57.166 --> 13:59.375
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
I KNOW HOW IT IS.

14:01.083 --> 14:01.959
WELL, I DOUBT THAT.

14:04.375 --> 14:05.875
LET ME GUESS.

14:05.875 --> 14:08.000
THE BOYFRIEND BAILED
WHEN THE STICK TURNED BLUE,

14:08.000 --> 14:09.500
LEAVING HIS
RUSTED-OUT CAMARO

14:09.500 --> 14:10.834
UP ON BLOCKS
ON YOUR LAWN,

14:10.834 --> 14:12.417
FORCING YOU TO DROP
OUT OF SCHOOL

14:12.417 --> 14:15.458
AND RELY ON YOUR
NOT-SO-RELIABLE ALKIE MOM

14:15.458 --> 14:16.834
TO WATCH THE LITTLE
CARPET MONKEY

14:16.834 --> 14:19.041
WHILE YOU WAIT TABLES
ON YOUR HIGH HORSE.

14:19.041 --> 14:21.375
NONE OF WHICH IS
MY PROBLEM, HON.

14:21.375 --> 14:23.041
THIS IS SERIOUSLY GOING
TO CUT INTO YOUR GRATUITY.

14:27.834 --> 14:30.667
[LAUGHS] OH, COME ON!

14:30.667 --> 14:31.667
WHERE'S YOUR
SENSE OF HUMOR?

14:31.667 --> 14:32.834
I WAS KIDDING.

14:32.834 --> 14:34.000
WELL, NOT KIDDING
ACTUALLY.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.208
MORE LIKE, UH,
CONDUCTING AN EXPERIMENT.

14:37.208 --> 14:39.875
MY FATHER, WHO IS
A WORLD-CLASS CRETIN,

14:39.875 --> 14:41.834
SAYS STUFF LIKE THAT
TO THE HELP ALL THE TIME.

14:41.834 --> 14:43.500
AND I ALWAYS THINK,
"WHAT AN IDIOT!"

14:43.500 --> 14:44.875
YOU KNOW? I MEAN,
THEY'RE JUST GONNA

14:44.875 --> 14:47.417
GO BACK IN THE KITCHEN
AND SPIT IN HIS FOOD.

14:47.417 --> 14:48.583
OR WORSE EVEN.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.166
FANCY THAT.

14:50.166 --> 14:53.542
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME
WHILE I GO CHECK
ON YOUR ORDER?

14:55.875 --> 14:57.917
YOU WOULD, WOULDN'T YOU?

14:57.917 --> 14:59.250
WOULD WHAT?

14:59.250 --> 15:01.000
SPIT IN MY FOOD.

15:02.542 --> 15:03.625
OR WORSE EVEN.

15:03.625 --> 15:04.708
[CHUCKLES]
I KNEW IT!

15:04.708 --> 15:06.917
YOU STRIKE ME
AS VERY MUCH

15:06.917 --> 15:09.125
IN TOUCH WITH
YOUR DARK SIDE.

15:09.125 --> 15:09.667
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR CANDOR.

15:09.667 --> 15:11.792
OH, MY PLEASURE.

15:11.792 --> 15:14.125
FIRST DAY
ON THE JOB, HUH?

15:14.125 --> 15:15.250
YES.

15:15.250 --> 15:18.834
AND, UH, HOW MUCH DO YOU
HATE THEM ALREADY?

15:18.834 --> 15:19.917
WHO?

15:19.917 --> 15:22.625
THE SUPERFICIAL SNOBS
LAYING DOWN HUGE SUMS

15:22.625 --> 15:24.375
FOR THE PRIVILEGE
OF FROLICKING
IN THE PRESENCE

15:24.375 --> 15:26.041
OF OTHER MEMBERS
OF THEIR TRIBE.

15:26.041 --> 15:27.583
CREEPS.

15:27.583 --> 15:29.041
WOW. CUE
THE VIOLINS.

15:29.041 --> 15:31.417
YOU KNOW,
NOTHING TUGS
THE HEARTSTRINGS

15:31.417 --> 15:36.000
LIKE THE ANGUISHED
CRY OF A POOR
LITTLE RICH BOY.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.083
WOULD YOU SIGN,
PLEASE?

15:37.083 --> 15:38.875
SURE.

15:48.125 --> 15:50.250
SOMETHING WRONG?

15:52.875 --> 15:55.208
YOUR ORDER
WILL BE RIGHT UP.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.875
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Dawson: HEY.

15:59.875 --> 16:02.208
DO I DETECT
SOMETHING VAGUELY
OF MY GENERATION?

16:02.208 --> 16:04.959
YEAH. I'VE BEEN GIVING
THAT GRATEFUL DEAD ALBUM

16:04.959 --> 16:09.166
YOU AND MOM GAVE ME
A SECOND CHANCE.

16:09.166 --> 16:10.125
I DON'T GET IT.
I STILL DON'T HAVE

16:10.125 --> 16:11.959
THE SLIGHTEST INCLINATION
TO DROP ACID

16:11.959 --> 16:15.041
OR START USING
HEMP PRODUCTS

16:15.041 --> 16:18.750
OR INCORPORATE ANYTHING
REMOTELY TIE-DYED
INTO MY WARDROBE.

16:18.750 --> 16:19.792
WELL, DAWSON...

16:19.792 --> 16:22.208
THE DEAD WERE
A PHENOMENON

16:22.208 --> 16:23.375
TO BE
EXPERIENCED LIVE.

16:23.375 --> 16:28.583
THOUSANDS OF NOMADIC
FANS, THE ENDLESS
JAMS...

16:28.583 --> 16:31.458
THAT'S NEVER GONNA
COME THROUGH
THOSE HEADPHONES.

16:31.458 --> 16:32.625
DO YOU EVER JUST
GET THE FEELING

16:32.625 --> 16:33.625
THAT YOU AND MOM
ARE MAYBE

16:33.625 --> 16:35.208
A LITTLE COOLER
THAN I AM?

16:35.208 --> 16:36.875
IT'S A BURDEN,
BUT WE COPE.

16:36.875 --> 16:39.917
[CHUCKLES]
GOOD TO KNOW.

16:41.208 --> 16:42.625
I SAW PACEY
AT SCHOOL TODAY.

16:42.625 --> 16:45.291
OH, YEAH? ME, TOO.

16:45.291 --> 16:46.375
I HAD TO SIT
DOWN WITH HIM

16:46.375 --> 16:47.917
ABOUT HIS SCHEDULE
THIS YEAR.

16:47.917 --> 16:50.542
UH-HUH.

16:50.542 --> 16:52.542
HE'S IN TROUBLE,
DAWSON.

16:52.542 --> 16:54.500
AND THAT
CONCERNS ME HOW?

16:54.500 --> 16:57.959
WELL, LOOK, I KNOW
THAT PACEY ISN'T
YOUR FAVORITE PERSON

16:57.959 --> 16:59.291
RIGHT NOW,
BUT TRUST ME,

16:59.291 --> 17:00.583
YOU'RE NOT
ALWAYS GOING
TO FEEL LIKE THAT.

17:00.583 --> 17:02.166
I DON'T KNOW, DAD.
I CAN MAYBE SEE THIS ONE

17:02.166 --> 17:03.208
STANDING THE TEST OF TIME.

17:03.208 --> 17:04.541
HEAR ME OUT.

17:04.541 --> 17:05.375
PACEY HAS
GOTTEN HIMSELF

17:05.375 --> 17:07.959
IN SOME REAL
ACADEMIC TROUBLE.

17:07.959 --> 17:08.875
WITHOUT THE SUPPORT
OF HIS FRIENDS,

17:08.875 --> 17:10.834
HE MIGHT
NOT GRADUATE
HIGH SCHOOL.

17:10.834 --> 17:12.959
WELL, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT
ME TO DO ABOUT IT?

17:12.959 --> 17:14.165
I DON'T KNOW.

17:14.165 --> 17:15.625
BUT I'VE ALWAYS
TAKEN PRIDE

17:15.625 --> 17:18.000
IN THE FACT THAT
MY SON IS SOMEONE

17:18.000 --> 17:20.208
HIS FRIENDS
CAN TURN TO WHEN
THEY NEED HIM.

17:20.208 --> 17:22.375
OK, DAD, I...

17:22.375 --> 17:25.541
I REALIZE THIS MIGHT SEEM
A LITTLE HYPERDRAMATIC

17:25.541 --> 17:27.165
FROM THE COOL, CALM
PERSPECTIVE OF AN ADULT,

17:27.165 --> 17:30.708
BUT THIS IS
MY WORLD, OK? MY LIFE.

17:30.708 --> 17:32.250
MY QUOTE-UNQUOTE
BEST FRIEND

17:32.250 --> 17:33.708
PURSUED A RELATIONSHIP
WITH A GIRL

17:33.708 --> 17:35.041
THAT I'VE LOVED
IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER

17:35.041 --> 17:36.333
FOR AS LONG
AS I CAN REMEMBER.

17:36.333 --> 17:40.208
AND THAT HURTS
SO MUCH THAT SOMETIMES
I CAN'T SIT STILL.

17:40.208 --> 17:41.959
NOW, I THINK I'VE DONE
A PRETTY GOOD JOB

17:41.959 --> 17:43.834
OF TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD,

17:43.834 --> 17:45.333
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MEAN THAT PACEY

17:45.333 --> 17:46.708
GETS TO GO ON
REAPING THE BENEFITS

17:46.708 --> 17:47.750
OF MY FRIENDSHIP.
ALL RIGHT?

17:47.750 --> 17:50.166
HE'S ON HIS OWN.
I CAN'T HELP HIM.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.291
WELL, MAYBE YOU KNOW
SOMEONE WHO CAN.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.083
Andie: YOU'RE
KIDDING ME.

18:06.083 --> 18:08.208
HE WANTS TO BREAK UP
WITH HER?

18:08.208 --> 18:09.959
WELL, HE SAID HE WANTS
TO TAKE A BREAK.

18:09.959 --> 18:12.291
AFTER ALL THAT?

18:12.291 --> 18:14.041
AFTER DOGGEDLY
PURSUING HER

18:14.041 --> 18:15.875
FOR AN ENTIRE
SCHOOL YEAR,

18:15.875 --> 18:19.583
AFTER SCORES
OF GRAND ROMANTIC
GESTURES,

18:19.583 --> 18:23.375
AFTER BEHAVIOR
THAT CLEARLY

18:23.375 --> 18:25.208
LICENSED
PROFESSIONALS WOULD
CALL STALKING,

18:25.208 --> 18:27.250
HE  WANTS
TO TAKE A BREAK?

18:27.250 --> 18:29.959
YEAH, WELL, LOOK.
HE'S AT A NEW SCHOOL,

18:29.959 --> 18:31.208
GIRLS ARE FLIRTING
WITH HIM,

18:31.208 --> 18:33.000
AND HE'S CONFUSED.
HENRY'S A GREAT GUY

18:33.000 --> 18:35.875
BUT, YOU KNOW,
HE'S 16.

18:36.667 --> 18:39.041
GUYS ARE MADDENING
CREATURES.

18:39.041 --> 18:42.000
HEH! TELL ME ABOUT IT.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
SO WHAT DID YOU
TELL HIM?

18:43.000 --> 18:45.625
I SAID I'D
TALK TO HER.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.291
HMM, NO. JACK,
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

18:47.291 --> 18:50.542
IN FACT, IT BORDERS
ON THE TERRIBLE.

18:50.542 --> 18:51.875
WHY?

18:51.875 --> 18:54.083
BECAUSE WHATEVER
IS BETWEEN

18:54.083 --> 18:55.875
JEN AND HENRY IS
FIRMLY AND CLEARLY

18:55.875 --> 18:58.458
BETWEEN
JEN AND HENRY.

18:58.458 --> 18:59.792
AND BESIDES,
IF A GUY WAS GONNA

18:59.792 --> 19:01.542

NO, I DON'T.

28:23.375 --> 28:26.125
WHY?
DON'T YOU GET IT, JO?

28:26.125 --> 28:27.083
WHEN YOU
LOVE SOMEONE,

28:27.083 --> 28:28.250
YOU WANT HER TO BE
PROUD OF YOU,

28:28.250 --> 28:29.750
YOU WANT HER
TO THINK THERE'S

28:29.750 --> 28:32.500
NOTHING IN THE WORLD
THAT YOU'RE
INCAPABLE OF.

28:33.917 --> 28:36.875
AND THE THOUGHT
OF DISAPPOINTING
HER IS--

28:36.875 --> 28:39.458
IT'S CRIPPLING.

28:49.041 --> 28:49.959
GOOD NIGHT.

29:01.041 --> 29:01.750
THERE HE IS.

29:01.750 --> 29:04.041
TRY NOT
TO BRUISE HIM.

29:04.041 --> 29:06.708
HEY, THERE'S MY GIRL.

29:06.708 --> 29:08.875
WHY WEREN'T YOU
IN SCHOOL TODAY?

29:08.875 --> 29:10.208
WHY ARE YOU
SUDDENLY IN DANGER
OF FLUNKING OUT?

29:10.208 --> 29:12.083
WHY DO I HAVE
TO HEAR ABOUT IT
FROM DAWSON?

29:12.083 --> 29:12.875
WHY DOES DAWSON KNOW
MORE ABOUT YOUR LIFE

29:12.875 --> 29:15.125
RIGHT NOW
THAN I DO, PACEY?

29:15.125 --> 29:18.583
WELL, BECAUSE APPARENTLY
LEERY SENIOR HAS
A VERY BIG MOUTH.

29:18.583 --> 29:19.583
AND, OH, HOW I BET
JUNIOR LOVED

29:19.583 --> 29:21.583
BEING ON THE RECEIVING END
OF THAT NEWS.

29:21.583 --> 29:23.458
CAN WE JUST STICK
TO THE POINT,
PLEASE?

29:23.458 --> 29:25.583
NO, HONESTLY, I'M SURE
HE LOVED HEARING
THAT, YOU KNOW?

29:25.583 --> 29:26.583
NOW HE'S SALIVATING.

29:26.583 --> 29:28.583
THE GUY GETS TO SWOOP IN
ON HIS SOULMATE

29:28.583 --> 29:30.500
WITH A BIG FAT
"I TOLD YOU SO."

29:30.500 --> 29:32.125
ARE YOU DELUSIONAL?

29:32.125 --> 29:34.208
DAWSON HAS ZERO
TO DO WITH THIS, PACEY.

29:34.208 --> 29:34.917
YEAH, SURE.

29:38.083 --> 29:40.083
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW
INSULTING IT IS

29:40.083 --> 29:42.208
TO KNOW THAT I COME UP
LAST ON YOUR LIST

29:42.208 --> 29:44.542
OF PEOPLE TO CONTACT
IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY?

29:44.542 --> 29:46.834
JO, THIS IS NOT
THAT BIG A DEAL,
YOU KNOW?

29:46.834 --> 29:48.417
I'M HANDLING IT.

29:48.417 --> 29:49.375
AND HOW DOES
CUTTING SCHOOL

29:49.375 --> 29:52.959
TRANSLATE INTO
"HANDLING IT,"
PACEY?

29:54.041 --> 29:55.041
WHY DOES THIS
EVEN SURPRISE ME?

29:56.834 --> 29:59.291
WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

29:59.291 --> 30:01.250
EXACTLY WHAT I SAID.

30:03.041 --> 30:05.542
THIS IS HOW YOU DEAL
WITH EVERYTHING.

30:05.542 --> 30:09.166
YOU RUN AWAY.

30:09.166 --> 30:10.333
YOU TAKE THE EASY
WAY OUT EVERY TIME.

30:10.333 --> 30:13.375
WELL, I GUESS THAT'S
WHY I'M SUCH A LOSER.

30:13.375 --> 30:14.333
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT
A LOSER, PACEY.

30:14.333 --> 30:17.750
I DIDN'T SPEND MY SUMMER
WITH A LOSER,

30:17.750 --> 30:18.792
YOU KNOW, BUILDING
WHAT I THOUGHT WAS

30:18.792 --> 30:21.917
AN INCREDIBLE FOUNDATION
FOR A RELATIONSHIP.

30:21.917 --> 30:24.917
I THOUGHT THAT WE WERE
A GREAT TEAM.

30:26.291 --> 30:30.500
IT TURNS OUT I GUESS
I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
MORE WRONG.

30:41.834 --> 30:44.375
I WANT YOU TO GET UP,
TAKE A SHOWER,

30:44.375 --> 30:46.083
BUTTON UP YOUR BEST
BOWLING SHIRT,

30:46.083 --> 30:48.834
AND GO AND APOLOGIZE
TO THAT GIRLFRIEND
OF YOURS.

30:48.834 --> 30:51.166
DO YOU THINK MAYBE YOU
COULD JUST LEAVE ME ALONE?

30:51.166 --> 30:53.041
PACEY, THIS GIRL
IS A KEEPER,

30:53.041 --> 30:54.500
AND I CANNOT
IN GOOD CONSCIENCE

30:54.500 --> 30:57.667
ALLOW YOU
TO BLOW IT BECAUSE
YOU'RE SCARED.

30:57.667 --> 30:59.875
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

30:59.875 --> 31:01.166
I'M NOT SCARED!

31:01.166 --> 31:02.542
LIKE A LITTLE GIRL.

31:02.542 --> 31:03.750
OH, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

31:03.750 --> 31:04.834
AND IF YOU'RE
NOT CAREFUL,

31:04.834 --> 31:06.166
YOU ARE GONNA
SABOTAGE
THIS RELATIONSHIP

31:06.166 --> 31:09.458
BEFORE IT HAS
A CHANCE TO
BECOME SOMETHING.

31:09.458 --> 31:13.291
I'M GONNA SABOTAGE IT, HUH?

31:13.291 --> 31:15.708
HMM. METHINKS
YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING
A LITTLE TOO MUCH OPRAH.

31:15.708 --> 31:17.458
I AM SERIOUS, PACEY.

31:17.458 --> 31:19.333
WELL, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

31:19.333 --> 31:20.959
YOU KNOW, I'VE HAD
TO LISTEN IN STEREO
ALL MY LIFE

31:20.959 --> 31:23.291
TO MY BROTHER
AND MY FATHER

31:23.291 --> 31:24.834
TELLING ME
HOW STUPID I AM.

31:24.834 --> 31:28.333
HOW CAN I HELP NOT
FEELING LIKE A MORON
SOMETIMES?

31:28.333 --> 31:29.750
YOU'RE RIGHT,
THEY'RE JERKS.

31:29.750 --> 31:31.333
BOTH OF THEM,
YOU KNOW.

31:31.333 --> 31:32.625
BUT GET OVER IT
ALREADY.

31:32.625 --> 31:34.708
I MEAN, DAD AND DOUG

31:34.708 --> 31:36.500
HAVE SO MANY PROBLEMS
BETWEEN THEM

31:36.500 --> 31:39.166
YOU SHOULD JUST THROW
THEM A HUGE PITY PARTY.

31:39.166 --> 31:40.708
AND THEY'RE NOT
YOUR PROBLEM.

31:40.708 --> 31:42.708
OH, PLEASE TELL ME,
GREAT ORACLE
OF CAPESIDE,

31:42.708 --> 31:44.542
WHO IS?

31:44.542 --> 31:46.417
YOUR PROBLEM IS DAWSON.

31:47.333 --> 31:50.041
DON'T TELL ME
YOU DON'T HEAR HIM.

31:50.041 --> 31:51.625
YOU KNOW, WHISPERING
IN YOUR EAR,

31:51.625 --> 31:54.083
TELLING YOU THAT
YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

31:54.083 --> 31:56.166
BUT HE'S JUST
A GHOST, PACE.

31:56.166 --> 31:57.375
SHE PICKED YOU,

31:57.375 --> 31:59.542
AND NOW YOU HAVE
TO DEAL WITH IT.

32:05.708 --> 32:06.750
YOU WANTED
TO SEE ME?

32:06.750 --> 32:09.834
HAVE A SEAT, MS. POTTER.

32:11.375 --> 32:13.792
I WAS GOING OVER
YESTERDAY'S RECEIPTS,

32:13.792 --> 32:14.750
AND I NOTICED THAT
A COUPLE OF THEM

32:14.750 --> 32:17.500
WERE SIGNED BY OWEN ROSS.

32:17.500 --> 32:20.166
RIGHT.

32:20.166 --> 32:22.041
THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WERE
A GOOD FRIEND OF THE FAMILY?

32:22.041 --> 32:23.125
I AM.

32:23.125 --> 32:24.875
WELL, IF YOU'RE
SUCH A GOOD FRIEND,

32:24.875 --> 32:26.625
WOULDN'T YOU KNOW HE
AND HIS FAMILY ARE IN PARIS

32:26.625 --> 32:30.083
UNTIL AFTER THE FIRST
OF THE YEAR?

32:30.083 --> 32:32.166
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

32:32.166 --> 32:33.250
NO, IT DOESN'T.

32:33.250 --> 32:34.250
MRS. VALENTINE,
HE WAS HERE.

32:34.250 --> 32:36.333
I SERVED HIM.
HE WAS VERY RUDE.

32:36.333 --> 32:41.125
YEAH. I'M NOT SURE THIS
IS GOING TO WORK OUT,
MS. POTTER.

32:41.125 --> 32:44.417
ACTUALLY, MOM,
THE ROSS KID WAS HERE.

32:44.417 --> 32:47.500
DRUE, HONEY,
I'M RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING HERE.

32:47.500 --> 32:50.500
GOTCHA, MOMS, BUT, UH,
MAYBE YOU DIDN'T HEAR
WHAT I SAID.

32:50.500 --> 32:51.750
OWEN ROSS...
HE, UH, WAS HERE.

32:51.750 --> 32:54.333
SAW HIM, OWN 2 EYES.

32:54.333 --> 32:55.834
AND I SAW JOEY HERE
WAITING ON HIM,

32:55.834 --> 32:57.250
AND I THINK YOU MIGHT
WANT TO COMMEND HER

32:57.250 --> 32:59.291
FOR THE WAY
SHE HANDLED HIM

32:59.291 --> 33:03.041
BECAUSE THAT GUY,
HE CAN BE REAL
HIGH MAINTENANCE.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.083
WHAT JUST HAPPENED
IN THERE?

33:13.083 --> 33:16.458
HEY, COULD YOU WATCH
YOUR TONE, PLEASE?

33:16.458 --> 33:18.458
I THINK I JUST
SAVED YOUR JOB.

33:18.458 --> 33:19.917
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

33:22.125 --> 33:24.291
DRUE. DRUE VALENTINE.

33:24.291 --> 33:25.959
MRS. VALENTINE...
THAT'S YOUR MOM?

33:25.959 --> 33:28.959
HEY, YOU PICK UP QUICK.

33:30.083 --> 33:32.291
BUT YOU SAID ALL THAT
HORRIBLE STUFF ABOUT HER.

33:32.291 --> 33:34.708
WHICH DOESN'T MAKE IT
ANY LESS TRUE.

33:35.792 --> 33:37.000
YOU LIED TO ME.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.417
CORRECTION. I WAS
PLAYING WITH YOU.

33:38.417 --> 33:40.458
WHY?

33:40.458 --> 33:42.291
IT WAS FUN.

33:42.291 --> 33:43.875
MY MOM TOLD ME
ABOUT THE NEW GIRL,

33:43.875 --> 33:46.083
THE ONE WHO
WAS A FRIEND
OF THE ROSSES.

33:46.083 --> 33:47.583
I TOOK ONE LOOK
AT YOU AND KNEW

33:47.583 --> 33:49.333
THAT YOU LIED
YOUR WAY
INTO THE JOB.

33:49.333 --> 33:51.041
WHICH I TOTALLY
DIG ABOUT YOU,
BY THE WAY.

33:51.041 --> 33:52.166
[SIGHS]
YOU'RE A FREAK.

33:52.166 --> 33:55.250
OK, ALL RIGHT,
SO I'M NOT WHO
I SAID I WAS.

33:55.250 --> 33:56.375
BIG DEAL.

33:56.375 --> 33:58.875
I'M ACTUALLY
A LOT MORE FUN.

34:09.083 --> 34:10.708
Dawson: IT'S OK
TO BE HURT, JEN.

34:10.708 --> 34:12.833
I'M NOT HURT,
DAWSON.

34:12.833 --> 34:14.875
IT'S JUST THAT
ONLY REAL BOYFRIEND
THAT I EVER HAD

34:14.875 --> 34:18.667
ENLISTED THE HELP
OF MY BEST FRIEND
TO DUMP ME, AND...

34:19.667 --> 34:20.792
YOU KNOW, I'M--
AND I'M JUST ANGRY.

34:20.792 --> 34:23.125
TAKE IT FROM SOMEBODY

34:23.125 --> 34:26.625
WHO SPENT THE BETTER PART
OF LAST SPRING
ANGRY AT THE WORLD.

34:26.625 --> 34:28.250
[SIGHS]
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

34:28.250 --> 34:30.500
I MEAN, IT MIGHT NUMB
THE PAIN A LITTLE BIT,

34:30.500 --> 34:32.583
BUT IT'S BASICALLY
JUST A DISTRACTION.

34:32.583 --> 34:34.500
[EXHALES DEEPLY]

34:38.375 --> 34:40.750
I DON'T KNOW.

34:40.750 --> 34:42.041
POINT IS, IF YOU
DO IT RIGHT, JEN,

34:42.041 --> 34:44.250
LOVING SOMEONE'S
GONNA HURT.

34:46.417 --> 34:47.417
AND THE SOONER YOU
LET YOURSELF FEEL THAT,

34:47.417 --> 34:50.708
THE SOONER YOU'LL
BE ABLE TO LOVE AGAIN.

34:51.833 --> 34:53.000
DAWSON,
I REALLY DON'T NEED

34:53.000 --> 34:55.917
ONE OF YOUR SAPPY
SELF-HELP SEMINARS
RIGHT NOW.

34:55.917 --> 34:57.417
JUST TRYING
TO REPAY A FAVOR.

34:57.417 --> 34:58.333
OH, WHAT?

34:58.333 --> 35:00.542
YOU'VE BEEN SAGE
TO MY SIMPLETON

35:00.542 --> 35:03.291
MORE TIMES THAN I
CARE TO COUNT.

35:03.291 --> 35:04.583
GOD, WHY DIDN'T
JUST THROW ME

35:04.583 --> 35:05.792
INTO ONCOMING
TRAFFIC?

35:05.792 --> 35:07.125
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE
YOU HELPED ME

35:07.125 --> 35:09.208
THROUGH THE WORST
OF TIMES.

35:11.583 --> 35:14.667
I'VE REALLY LEARNED
A LOT FROM YOU, JEN.

35:14.667 --> 35:16.875
REALLY? LIKE HOW
TO DOWNWARD SPIRAL
YOUR WAY

35:16.875 --> 35:18.083
INTO ADULTHOOD?

35:18.083 --> 35:20.792
[LAUGHING] NO!

35:20.792 --> 35:21.750
NO, YOU DIDN'T.
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO TAUGHT ME

35:21.750 --> 35:24.542
THAT LOVE CAN SUCK.

35:26.041 --> 35:30.458
FEELINGS CHANGE,
PASSIONS FADE,
PARTNERS COME AND GO.

35:30.458 --> 35:34.125
BUT THAT THROUGH IT ALL,
ONE THING REMAINS SACRED,
AND THAT'S FRIENDSHIP.

35:34.125 --> 35:36.708
AND IT'S TRUE BECAUSE...

35:36.708 --> 35:40.333
I MEAN...

35:40.333 --> 35:41.959
GOD, WITHOUT YOU GUYS
THIS SUMMER,

35:41.959 --> 35:43.750
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN
A HUGE BLACK HOLE

35:43.750 --> 35:45.542
OF DEPRESSION FOR ME.

35:46.750 --> 35:48.041
DO YOU HAVE TO BE
SO DAMNED EARNEST?

35:48.041 --> 35:49.291
IT'S DISGUSTING
REALLY.

35:49.291 --> 35:51.208
I MEAN, IT MAKES ME
WANNA DROWN YOU
IN THE CREEK.

35:51.208 --> 35:53.667
OH, IT'S PART
OF MY CHARM.

35:55.041 --> 35:57.959
FUNNY THING
ABOUT FRIENDS.

35:57.959 --> 35:59.333
SOMETIMES THEY BRING YOU
THE WORST OF NEWS,

35:59.333 --> 36:02.667
BUT IT'S ALWAYS
WITH THE BEST
OF INTENTIONS.

36:04.291 --> 36:06.125
JACK.
HEY.

36:06.125 --> 36:08.125
THANK GOD. TAKE HER
OFF MY HANDS FOR A WHILE?

36:08.125 --> 36:08.792
SURE.

36:08.792 --> 36:11.625
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

36:14.041 --> 36:14.375
HEY.
[LAUGHS]

36:16.208 --> 36:19.667
ALL RIGHT,
I--I THINK I OWE YOU

36:19.667 --> 36:21.333
A FAIRLY HUGE APOLOGY.

36:22.625 --> 36:26.166
OK, THAT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE MY LINE.

36:27.166 --> 36:28.000
YOU'RE SORRY, I'M SORRY,

36:28.000 --> 36:31.417
SOMEBODY'S ALWAYS SORRY.

36:31.417 --> 36:33.708
I MEAN, RELATIONSHIPS
ARE JUST ONE BIG
SORRY AFTER ANOTHER,

36:33.708 --> 36:36.333
CULMINATING IN A BIG
FINAL MESSY SORRY.

36:37.667 --> 36:39.792
SOUNDS
LIKE SOMEONE'S
DROWNING HERSELF

36:39.792 --> 36:42.250
IN AN ECONOMY-SIZED
VAT OF SELF-PITY.

36:42.250 --> 36:45.000
COME ON, JACK. AREN'T
THE RECENTLY DUMPED

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
ALLOWED TO WALLOW
JUST A BIT?

36:46.000 --> 36:48.583
I'M REALLY SORRY,
JEN.

36:48.583 --> 36:51.083
ME, TOO. I'M...

36:51.083 --> 36:53.208
SORRY FOR KILLING
THE MESSENGER.

36:53.208 --> 36:53.959
I JUST DIDN'T NEED
YOU TO BE THE ONE

36:53.959 --> 36:57.583
TO GIVE ME THE BAD NEWS.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.417
I NEEDED YOU TO BE
MY SHOULDER.

37:02.291 --> 37:04.083
COME HERE.

37:14.458 --> 37:16.250
BETTER LATE THAN NEVER?

37:32.000 --> 37:34.208
HEY, THERE'S MY GIRL.

37:39.417 --> 37:42.041
YOU'RE NOT LIKING ME SO MUCH
RIGHT NOW, ARE YOU?

37:42.041 --> 37:44.875
NOT SO MUCH, NO.

37:48.458 --> 37:50.750
SO, YOU KNOW,
I'M TALKING TO MY SISTER,

37:50.750 --> 37:54.000
AND SHE SAYS TO ME,
"THAT'S ACTUALLY
NOT SUCH A BAD IDEA

37:54.000 --> 37:55.583
TO DISCUSS YOUR PROBLEMS
WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND."

37:55.583 --> 37:57.500
NICE TO KNOW SOMEONE
IN THE WITTER FAMILY

37:57.500 --> 37:59.375
CAN BOAST
A BRAIN CELL OR TWO.

38:02.583 --> 38:05.625
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
MAKE THIS EASY
ON ME, ARE YOU?

38:06.750 --> 38:09.083
OK.

38:09.083 --> 38:11.417
SO WHERE DO I START?

38:11.417 --> 38:14.166
WHEREVER YOU WANT.

38:15.166 --> 38:17.625
WELL, I SHOULD PROBABLY
JUST START FIRST

38:17.625 --> 38:21.417
BY SAYING THAT YOU,
JOSEPHINE POTTER,

38:21.417 --> 38:24.458
HAVE JUST WRECKED ME.

38:24.458 --> 38:26.166
IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY,

38:26.166 --> 38:28.583
YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY
WRECKED ME.

38:28.583 --> 38:31.625
BECAUSE, YOU SEE,
I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU

38:31.625 --> 38:34.917
KNOWING THAT THERE WAS
NEVER ANY POSSIBILITY
OF BEING WITH YOU,

38:34.917 --> 38:40.125
KNOWING FULL WELL
THAT A SIZEABLE CHUNK
OF YOUR HEART WOULD...

38:40.125 --> 38:45.125
ALWAYS BE WRAPPED UP
IN OUR FRIEND DAWSON.

38:45.125 --> 38:47.458
AND THAT MUCH WAS
ACTUALLY OK WITH ME,

38:47.458 --> 38:50.041
RIGHT UP UNTIL THE POINT
THAT YOU CHOSE ME.

38:51.500 --> 38:54.417
[SIGHS] 'CAUSE THEN YOU
JUST TURNED EVERYTHING
ON ITS HEAD.

38:54.417 --> 38:57.000
THEN I GOT EVERYTHING
THAT I WANTED,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.083
AND FROM THAT DAY FORWARD

38:59.083 --> 39:00.834
I'VE JUST BEEN A WRECK.

39:00.834 --> 39:02.250
WHY?

39:02.250 --> 39:04.500
BECAUSE...
NOW ALL I CAN DO

39:04.500 --> 39:06.333
IS JUST WAIT FOR
THE OTHER SHOE TO DROP.

39:06.333 --> 39:08.667
YOU KNOW, JUST WAIT
FOR YOU TO REALIZE

39:08.667 --> 39:10.708
WHAT A BIG MISTAKE
YOU'VE MADE.

39:12.458 --> 39:16.500
WAIT FOR YOU TO REALIZE
THAT I'M JUST GONNA BE
A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.

39:16.500 --> 39:20.333
AND JUST WAIT FOR YOU
TO REALIZE THAT--

39:21.125 --> 39:22.583
THAT DAWSON IS THE GUY

39:22.583 --> 39:25.333
THAT YOU WANT TO BE WITH.

39:25.333 --> 39:27.834
PACEY, WHAT DOES
DAWSON HAVE TO DO

39:27.834 --> 39:29.667
WITH YOU SCREWING UP
AT SCHOOL?

39:31.542 --> 39:36.917
WELL, NOTHING
AND EVERYTHING.

39:36.917 --> 39:42.875
DAWSON LEERY WOULD...
NEVER  HAVE SCREWED UP
LIKE I DID, JO.

39:42.875 --> 39:45.500
IT JUST WOULDN'T HAVE
HAPPENED. YOU KNOW THAT.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.667
YOU'RE RIGHT.

39:52.458 --> 39:55.917
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT ELSE DAWSON
WOULD NEVER DO?

39:57.792 --> 39:59.208
HE WOULD NEVER
INSPIRE ME

39:59.208 --> 40:01.291
TO RUN AWAY WITH HIM
FOR THE SUMMER.

40:02.291 --> 40:03.208
IT JUST WOULDN'T
HAPPEN,

40:03.208 --> 40:06.333
AND YOU KNOW THAT.

40:06.333 --> 40:09.500
WE HAD A MAGIC
SUMMER, PACEY.

40:09.500 --> 40:10.625
I MEAN, WE SHARED
SOMETHING

40:10.625 --> 40:11.625
THAT I'M GONNA
REMEMBER

40:11.625 --> 40:13.125
FOR THE REST
OF MY LIFE.

40:13.125 --> 40:15.542
I MEAN,
DON'T YOU SEE?

40:15.542 --> 40:18.917
WE'RE CREATING
OUR OWN HISTORY
HERE.

40:18.917 --> 40:22.166
A HISTORY
THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH DAWSON.

40:22.166 --> 40:24.125
THAT'S A NICE WAY
OF LOOKING AT IT.

40:24.125 --> 40:25.917
YEAH.

40:28.500 --> 40:31.083
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS--

40:31.083 --> 40:32.834
THIS IS WHERE
IT GETS ROUGH.

40:32.834 --> 40:34.583
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

40:35.708 --> 40:37.792
WE SPENT 3 MONTHS
ON THE SEA, BUT...

40:37.792 --> 40:40.125
WE DIDN'T EVEN COME
CLOSE TO WEATHERING
THE STORM.

40:40.125 --> 40:41.417
WE RAN AWAY.

40:41.417 --> 40:44.917
WE MADE OUR OWN
REALITY AND...

40:46.583 --> 40:47.417
IT WAS SO
WONDERFUL--

40:47.417 --> 40:50.417
BUT IT COULDN'T
LAST FOREVER.

40:50.417 --> 40:52.000
NOR SHOULD IT.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.166
HEH.

40:53.166 --> 40:54.917
PACEY,
A RELATIONSHIP

40:54.917 --> 40:58.208
ISN'T ABOUT
A ROMANTIC
3-MONTH CRUISE.

41:01.542 --> 41:04.667
IT'S GONNA BE
THE DETAILS
THAT DEFINE US.

41:04.667 --> 41:06.625
YOU KNOW, LIKE...

41:06.625 --> 41:07.750
THE MOMENTS.

41:09.792 --> 41:11.500
OK.

41:12.667 --> 41:15.667
JOEY...I AM...

41:17.792 --> 41:22.250
REALLY SCARED. UM...

41:22.250 --> 41:24.250
I THINK THAT I SCREWED UP

41:24.250 --> 41:27.417
AND I'M GONNA
FLUNK OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL.

41:30.834 --> 41:33.166
[EXHALES DEEPLY]
SO I NEED YOUR HELP

41:33.166 --> 41:36.417
UM...REALLY BADLY.

41:36.417 --> 41:40.250
THAT'S ALL YOU
NEEDED TO SAY, PACE.

41:40.250 --> 41:41.333
HEH!

41:41.333 --> 41:42.834
OH, EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

41:42.834 --> 41:47.708
OH, BUT,
WHATEVER IT TAKES,
WE'RE GONNA FIX IT.

41:49.166 --> 41:51.458
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE OK.

41:51.458 --> 41:53.667
HOW CAN YOU BE SURE?

41:53.667 --> 41:57.500
I'M NOT
GOING ANYWHERE
WITHOUT YOU.

42:20.083 --> 42:22.250
POTTER?

42:22.250 --> 42:24.750
YEAH?

42:24.750 --> 42:27.625
HOW COME YOU'RE SO MUCH
SMARTER THAN I AM?

42:29.500 --> 42:32.417
I'M NOT THAT MUCH
SMARTER, PACE.

42:32.417 --> 42:33.708
YOU JUST HAPPEN
TO BE A LITTLE

42:33.708 --> 42:36.583
EMOTIONALLY
RETARDED.

42:36.583 --> 42:39.333
IS THAT IT?
YEAH!

42:39.333 --> 42:42.750
OH, THAT'S SUCH
A LOAD OFF MY MIND.

42:42.750 --> 42:44.792
[LAUGHS]

42:44.792 --> 42:46.333
LET'S GO MAKE OUT SOME MORE.

42:46.333 --> 42:49.000
SOUNDS ROMANTIC.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.875
WELL, YOU'RE FAR TOO CYNICAL
FOR MY ROMANTIC OVERTURES.

42:51.875 --> 42:54.875
DOESN'T MEAN YOU
DON'T EARN POINTS
FOR TRYING.

42:54.875 --> 42:57.708
OH, COME ON.
YOU LOVE ME.

42:57.708 --> 42:59.750
AND YOU BUG ME.
[CHUCKLES]
