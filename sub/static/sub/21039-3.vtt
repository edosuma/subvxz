Hmm... Do you think we could use
the giant comb like a bridge?

[Daisy] Sure! We can walk across it

11:59.900 --> 12:01.942

We need to add them to the Professor's

You see, I'm making a potion
to shrink Petey Bear

14:03.567 --> 14:05.900
so's he can fit inside my toy castle.

can let her long ponytail
hang over the balcony.
