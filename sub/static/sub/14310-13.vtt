Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:08.140 --> 00:12.080
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:12.099 --> 00:15.009
They call themselves Smurfs.

00:15.029 --> 00:16.219
They were good.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.219
He was bad.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.070
Oh, I hate smurfs.

You'll be sorry!

00:44.210 --> 00:47.030
(male narrator)
Well, the forest is still there

00:47.049 --> 00:51.070
and if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:51.090 --> 00:53.149
And if you are good,
you may just

its birds, its sunshine, its..

01:21.039 --> 01:23.079

Oh, an entire winter has passed
