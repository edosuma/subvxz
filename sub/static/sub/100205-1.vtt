WEBVTT

01:53.714 --> 01:55.814
Sole.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.902
Sole...

02:18.172 --> 02:20.506
Popo. Popo! Sh!

02:54.175 --> 02:56.508
Oh.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.364
Trying to make things better.

03:19.366 --> 03:23.468
- He never listens.
- Ah, I almost got it.

03:28.509 --> 03:29.775
Come plant it yourself.

04:14.154 --> 04:18.023
Sorry, sorry.

04:22.529 --> 04:26.898
Sorry, wrong note.

04:51.158 --> 04:54.026
Sole, are you guys not going?

05:13.781 --> 05:15.981
Hurry up!

05:33.067 --> 05:35.500
Uh...

05:36.603 --> 05:38.870
Uh, Popo...

05:50.684 --> 05:53.018
- Mm.
- Ah.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.454
Mm.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.656
Yeah.

06:14.341 --> 06:18.043
Why should we pick you to become
a seasonal worker?

06:18.045 --> 06:19.945
I'm a heavy lifter.

06:24.852 --> 06:27.252
I'm from a poor family.

06:27.254 --> 06:29.221
Just wanna be a rich family.

06:29.223 --> 06:31.923
You don't know this about me,
but, uh,

06:31.925 --> 06:33.458
I'm a really good guy.

06:33.460 --> 06:36.795
Go to church every Sunday,
Saturday.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.063
You know, every day.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.532
Cos I'm strong and handsome.

06:40.534 --> 06:43.168
I come bearing gifts.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.303
That's for you.

06:45.305 --> 06:47.706
Just gonna leave that there.

06:47.708 --> 06:50.142
How's your English?

06:50.544 --> 06:52.077
Come on, mate, mate, mate.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.578
How's my English?!

06:53.580 --> 06:54.813
You can't hear my English?

06:54.815 --> 06:56.982
Are you married or have
children?

06:56.984 --> 06:57.883
Never in my life.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.851
Single, just mingle.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.319
No, I'm not married...

07:01.321 --> 07:02.521
any more.

07:02.523 --> 07:05.590
- Do you do drugs?
- Panadol, yeah. Drugs, no.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.426
- No.
- No.

07:07.428 --> 07:08.410
No?

07:08.411 --> 07:09.393
Will you do drugs?

07:09.396 --> 07:12.297
Ah, sorry, sir.
I don't have a truck.

07:12.299 --> 07:16.134
I only have a bike,
drive around town.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.575
When the sun get up, I'm up.

07:23.577 --> 07:26.912
When the sun go down, I don't
go down; I stay up.

07:26.914 --> 07:29.281
I'm an honest person,

07:29.283 --> 07:32.250
and I love my family.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.620
New Zealand can be dangerous,

07:34.621 --> 07:36.655
and I'm wiling to do what it
takes to look after my people.

07:36.657 --> 07:37.622
Hi-yah! Hi-yah!

07:37.624 --> 07:38.857
Sig-tah! Hi-yah!

07:38.859 --> 07:42.027
When the season is finished,
will you come back to Samoa?

07:42.029 --> 07:44.296
Yeah. Build a new house,
make a business.

07:44.298 --> 07:47.699
Do the work, eh, to take it back
to Samoa.

07:49.203 --> 07:50.702
You guys gonna call me?

07:50.704 --> 07:51.803
Y- Nuh-It's OK.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.071
Thank you for sending me back to
New Zealand.

07:53.073 --> 07:55.874
- Oi, don't forget your money.
- Oh, it's not mine.

07:55.876 --> 07:58.543
Sure my one was green, but...

07:58.545 --> 07:59.945
Hi-yah! Hut-zah!

07:59.947 --> 08:03.281
Hut-zah! Nah, jokes.

08:55.135 --> 08:58.670
'Dear, Popo, congratulations...'

08:59.339 --> 09:01.606
Yeah!

09:03.610 --> 09:05.443
'Dear Alama, congratulations.

09:05.445 --> 09:09.114
'You've been accepted in our
sch-'

09:09.116 --> 09:12.417
Sole... Lama, we're
going to New Zealand!

09:13.987 --> 09:17.589
We're going to New Zealand!

09:24.097 --> 09:26.464
We're going! Whoo!

10:19.653 --> 10:23.455
Samoa Airways flight OL71 bound
for Auckland

10:23.457 --> 10:27.292
is now officially closed.
Thank you.

10:57.357 --> 11:01.026
Bob Titilo, private
investigator.

11:01.461 --> 11:04.029
Don't worry. I will find him.

11:04.031 --> 11:06.498
OK, have a good night.

11:19.579 --> 11:25.283
- Not on my watch.
- What watch?

11:26.119 --> 11:28.420
He can't even afford one.

11:28.422 --> 11:31.589
Grey Goose.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.905
Alfriston.

11:48.041 --> 11:52.944
You're coming with me. Your
presence has been requested.

11:52.946 --> 11:55.413
Is your name Alfriston?

11:55.415 --> 11:57.849
My dad's name.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.990
Don't worry. I got this, boys.

12:05.992 --> 12:06.758
Ss.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.728
Why'd you say my name?

12:09.796 --> 12:13.331
See, this is what I hate, man.
People come looking for me,

12:13.333 --> 12:17.368
saying my full name like that.
It's Alf, aiit?

12:18.772 --> 12:20.371
Suck it in, big fulla.

12:20.373 --> 12:22.941
Boys, remember that sleeper
I was talkin' about?

12:22.943 --> 12:24.342
Nice and gentle around the neck,
right?

12:24.344 --> 12:27.679
And just squeeze. Just squeeze.
There you go.

12:27.681 --> 12:31.883
Ha, ha! I got you right where
I wanted you.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.952
Right here.

12:37.991 --> 12:40.291
Sole! Uh, boys!

12:40.861 --> 12:43.194
Boys!

12:44.564 --> 12:46.898
Let's gap it!

12:57.310 --> 13:00.345
Room for improvement. Mm.

13:00.413 --> 13:05.350
Oh, another five minutes won't
hurt.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.257
Lama.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.492
Lama. Lama!

13:15.762 --> 13:17.729
Ooh!

13:25.005 --> 13:27.205
The Sky Tower.

13:29.876 --> 13:31.810
Whoa!

13:31.878 --> 13:34.379
Wow!

14:01.975 --> 14:03.741
Yeah, we just can't find enough
people locally.

14:03.743 --> 14:06.244
I mean, there's more work than
there is interest.

14:06.246 --> 14:09.480
So being able to fly in workers
as and when we need

14:09.482 --> 14:11.516
means that we can keep
operating profitably

14:11.518 --> 14:17.322
and without any long-term strain
on the infrastructure.

14:17.324 --> 14:19.524
And how do you keep these
workers motivated?

14:19.526 --> 14:22.861
Oh, they're self-motivated.
If a worker breaks the rules,

14:22.863 --> 14:24.796
decides to depart without
permission,

14:24.798 --> 14:27.966
that's gonna have consequences
for their families.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.467
You see, most of the workers
in this group,

14:29.469 --> 14:31.970
they're earning their money
for a year.

14:31.972 --> 14:34.038
Is it all right if we go and
talk to them?

14:34.040 --> 14:35.640
Yeah, sure.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.479
- Hey, Popo!
- Sole.

14:41.848 --> 14:44.115
I just wanted to grab a few
words.

14:44.117 --> 14:46.384
Uh, you want me to look into
your eyes?

14:46.386 --> 14:47.886
Just be natural.

14:49.122 --> 14:53.024
This is my natural.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.326
OK. Uh, Popo,
can you just tell me

14:55.328 --> 15:00.298
what you get from coming to
New Zealand and picking fruit?

15:00.300 --> 15:02.800
Uh, yeah. I... get the...

15:03.937 --> 15:06.204
I get the money.

15:10.577 --> 15:11.876
Hm.

15:11.878 --> 15:13.011
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:13.013 --> 15:15.647
Yep. Thank you.

15:15.649 --> 15:18.983
Probably... Can we
grab another one? Yeah.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.120
- Hey, uh, Alama!
- Lama.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.756
So, what sorts of things
do you buy?

15:24.758 --> 15:28.793
Um, things for the kids,
for their school.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.461
And maybe a fridge

15:30.463 --> 15:34.666
and a car to help my dad with
the plantation.

15:34.668 --> 15:38.202
And I wanna say thank you to
Sir Tony

15:39.105 --> 15:40.672
for the opportunity and, uh,

15:40.674 --> 15:43.775
wish I'll come back
and work here again.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.410
- Fa'afetai lava.
- Thank you.

15:45.412 --> 15:48.279
Yeah, really nice. Thank you.
We got a good one here.

15:48.281 --> 15:51.482
If you were a kiwi fruit,
I would pick you.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.718
Th-Thank you.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.620
- Yeah. Fa.
- See you later.

15:55.622 --> 15:59.791
Marry me for your visa!

18:26.673 --> 18:28.806
Popo.

18:32.078 --> 18:34.212
Popo?

18:39.652 --> 18:41.819
Popo!

18:43.756 --> 18:45.890
Popo?

18:48.094 --> 18:50.261
Popo?!

19:02.809 --> 19:05.309
If you're gonna make your plane,
you're gonna have to go now.

19:05.311 --> 19:08.012
I'm not gonna go back home with
nothing.

19:15.054 --> 19:18.055
But we'll do everything we can
to find him and your money.

19:18.057 --> 19:19.490
But even if you find him,

19:19.492 --> 19:22.026
you won't be able to get the
money off him.

19:22.028 --> 19:23.861
You don't know New Zealand.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.430
How you going to find him?

19:50.290 --> 19:52.456
Hello.

20:32.932 --> 20:36.500
I think it's a New Zealand
number.

20:36.502 --> 20:37.435
Hello.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.704
Oh, Alama!

20:59.359 --> 21:03.261
Let's not waste time.
Let's get a professional.

21:03.263 --> 21:05.930
And who's gonna pay for it?

21:10.236 --> 21:12.670
Well, my son can help.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.611
He's a private investigator.

21:20.913 --> 21:23.547
And he can start now.

21:23.549 --> 21:25.349
Bob!

21:39.365 --> 21:41.766
Bob, why are you the furniture?

21:41.768 --> 21:45.970
Uncle, I'm trying to practise my
private investigation skills.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.306
You know, like my stealth
movement.

21:48.308 --> 21:49.573
Never mind.

21:49.575 --> 21:52.576
What skill?

21:58.318 --> 22:00.584
- Thanks, Mum.
- Don't touch.

22:00.586 --> 22:02.286
Look at you!
Go and put those clothes

22:02.288 --> 22:04.522
I've got on your bed for you
to wear, son.

22:04.524 --> 22:06.157
- Mum.
- Don't just stand there.

22:06.159 --> 22:07.391
Go do as you're told.

22:07.393 --> 22:10.861
I'm 40, Mum.
I know what I'm doing.

22:10.863 --> 22:13.064
Do you really?

22:19.172 --> 22:20.304
Son!

22:20.306 --> 22:22.273
Don't stand there.
You're running late.

22:22.275 --> 22:23.641
- Yeah.
- Come on.

22:23.643 --> 22:24.942
Thanks, Mum.

22:24.944 --> 22:25.910
- And, son...
- Yeah.

22:25.912 --> 22:28.245
Please stay away from...

22:28.247 --> 22:31.182
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK.
- All right.

22:31.184 --> 22:33.317
- Love you, Mum.
- Love you too.

22:33.319 --> 22:35.886
- You have a nice day.
- K.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.758
Everyday Samoan language,
volume one.

22:40.760 --> 22:45.062
When you meet someone, you can
ask them...

23:26.939 --> 23:27.772
Tony Green.

23:27.774 --> 23:29.840
Bob Titilo,
private investigator.

23:29.842 --> 23:30.908
Yeah, Alama said
you'd be coming.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.110
It's incredibly unfortunate,
what happened.

23:33.112 --> 23:36.814
Oh, the audacity
is off the Richter!

23:37.250 --> 23:40.017
Ah. Oh, look, here's Alama.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.552
- Talofa lava.
- Oh, talofa lava.

23:41.554 --> 23:42.953
Thank you so much for coming.

23:42.955 --> 23:44.855
And I'm really sorry for this
burden.

23:44.857 --> 23:45.723
Oh, look, it's no problem.

23:45.725 --> 23:49.160
I'm sure I'll have everything
wrapped up by tomorrow.

23:49.162 --> 23:50.127
Oh, cool.

23:50.129 --> 23:54.165
Now, this Popo, he's related
to...

23:54.167 --> 23:54.732
to you?

23:54.734 --> 23:58.302
He's my brother. Not by blood -
I'm adopted -

23:58.304 --> 24:00.504
but we were raised together.

24:00.506 --> 24:02.907
So are you sure he took the
money?

24:02.909 --> 24:05.342
Oh, yes, very sure.

24:05.812 --> 24:07.311
How do you know?

24:07.313 --> 24:10.614
He's the only one not going back
to the island.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.616
And he's been acting strange.

24:12.618 --> 24:16.454
I... I think he's been planning
this for a while.

24:16.456 --> 24:18.322
Why did you have the money
in cash?

24:18.324 --> 24:20.758
- I was going to buy something.
- Like what?

24:20.760 --> 24:25.863
Just things for my family back
in the island.

24:25.865 --> 24:26.897
OK.

24:26.899 --> 24:29.366
Tony, is it OK if we check the
accommodation?

24:29.368 --> 24:31.235
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks, mate.

24:31.237 --> 24:33.137
- Right this way, sir.
- Yep.

24:33.139 --> 24:36.207
And we'll check in here first.

24:37.143 --> 24:40.311
Need to look for some evidence.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.224
Just what I thought.

24:54.460 --> 24:57.328
I'm bagging it for evidence.

25:04.103 --> 25:05.536
What about this?

25:05.538 --> 25:08.339
What's 'evidence' in Samoan?

25:08.341 --> 25:09.773
That's not evitesei.

25:09.775 --> 25:12.510
- Evelegi.
- Evelantage.

25:15.414 --> 25:17.147
Oh, here.

25:17.149 --> 25:20.184
Please, Alama, try not to help.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.820
Cos you're really not, OK?

25:25.358 --> 25:29.493
- Which one is Popo's bed?
- It's this one.

25:40.773 --> 25:43.908
- These must be Popo's.
- Yeah.

25:45.511 --> 25:47.311
Evidence.

25:47.380 --> 25:50.080
Tony, may I dust for
fingerprints?

25:50.082 --> 25:51.982
Whatever you need, Bob.

25:51.984 --> 25:57.521
- Do you need help?
- No. There's special training.

26:06.432 --> 26:09.700
Just what I thought.

26:10.169 --> 26:11.936
Can I ask you - why are we doing
this?

26:11.938 --> 26:14.638
Because I have to get into
Popo's mind.

26:14.640 --> 26:17.641
Who am I? How am I? Which am I?

26:17.643 --> 26:18.742
What am I?

26:18.744 --> 26:21.011
Before I know - where am I.

26:21.013 --> 26:22.846
Is that him?!

26:22.848 --> 26:24.715
- That's a tree.
- Exactly.

26:24.717 --> 26:27.351
You see, we have to
know where he isn't...

26:27.353 --> 26:30.020
in order to know where he is.

26:30.022 --> 26:33.958
Wow. Look at the wingspan of
those toes.

26:33.960 --> 26:38.095
You can definitely tell those
are Samoan footprints.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.431
Alama, lavalava.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.267
If I was Popo...

26:43.269 --> 26:45.603
If I am Popo...

26:47.740 --> 26:50.107
I would've gone...

26:50.443 --> 26:51.141
that way.

26:51.143 --> 26:53.344
Tony, thanks for your help,
mate.

26:53.346 --> 26:55.112
- I'll take it from here.
- OK, mate.

26:55.114 --> 26:58.082
Alama, we're gonna go on a
forest walk.

26:58.084 --> 26:59.350
I hope you're ready.

26:59.352 --> 27:02.419
My body's conditioned for it.

27:09.762 --> 27:12.096
Do you really think Popo
came through this way?

27:12.098 --> 27:17.001
If I was Popo, I'd be avoiding
all the main roads.

27:19.105 --> 27:21.739
Do you recognise that man?

27:23.309 --> 27:25.175
No.

27:25.244 --> 27:27.711
But that's my lavalava.

27:27.980 --> 27:30.781
OK. Leave the talking to me.

27:34.053 --> 27:36.687
Hey, mate. How's it going?

27:40.526 --> 27:43.060
- Talofa.
- Talofa lava.

27:43.396 --> 27:46.096
- I am Alama.
- Bob Titilo.

27:46.098 --> 27:48.766
- I'm Gareth.
- Oh, Gazza!

27:49.468 --> 27:52.036
Gazza, we're looking for a
Samoan b-

27:52.038 --> 27:53.270
Popo.

27:53.272 --> 27:58.442
He gave me his lavalava, so I
gave him a discount on a ride.

27:58.444 --> 27:58.809
Where to?

27:58.811 --> 28:01.745
Just a loop around the forest
track in a 4-wheel drive.

28:01.747 --> 28:03.447
- Are you two keen?
- Yes.

28:03.449 --> 28:07.785
We need to go through what he
went through.

28:11.824 --> 28:14.958
Selfie time!

28:14.960 --> 28:17.895
So people pay for a bumpy ride?

28:17.897 --> 28:19.496
Yeah. Something different, eh?

28:19.498 --> 28:21.598
Any idea where he went
to after this?

28:21.600 --> 28:25.502
Uh, yeah. He wanted to
go riding.

28:26.172 --> 28:28.806
- Horsey.
- Why am I doing this?

28:28.808 --> 28:31.241
Because we need to
get into his head.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.510
Why did Popo ride a horse?

28:33.512 --> 28:36.180
What can the horse tell us?

28:36.182 --> 28:38.382
Where did Popo go?

28:38.384 --> 28:40.751
Was it the TAB?

28:40.953 --> 28:42.086
Did he try and eat you?

28:42.088 --> 28:44.221
Are you sure you don't
wanna ride?

28:44.223 --> 28:46.857
Uh, do you wanna broke-back
horse?

28:48.093 --> 28:49.326
So what's the horse saying,
then?

28:49.328 --> 28:51.762
The horse is saying...

28:51.864 --> 28:53.764
mountain.

28:53.766 --> 28:56.300
- Horse guide lady.
- My name's Sharon.

28:56.302 --> 28:58.769
Shazza! Is there a mountain
nearby?

28:58.771 --> 29:02.372
Yeah. There's one just out
that way.

29:02.374 --> 29:05.309
Is there a smaller mountain?

29:05.311 --> 29:08.178
Preferably one that's flat.

29:11.117 --> 29:11.882
Look.

29:11.884 --> 29:15.385
You see these dents on the
ground?

29:16.122 --> 29:17.321
Nordic.

29:17.323 --> 29:19.089
What's a Nordic?

29:19.091 --> 29:19.690
Shh.

29:19.692 --> 29:23.994
Nordic. One in this hand,
one in the other hand...

29:23.996 --> 29:26.163
Yeah.

29:29.301 --> 29:31.802
Alama, hurry up.

29:44.750 --> 29:47.551
We're getting nowhere.

29:47.620 --> 29:49.887
You sure Popo came
through this way?

29:49.889 --> 29:53.190
Yes. The horse
wouldn't lie to me.

29:53.192 --> 29:56.894
Whoa, that is so beautiful.

29:56.896 --> 29:59.363
- It's a nice view up here.
- Yeah.

29:59.365 --> 30:02.432
That was way chill a walk than
I thought.

30:02.434 --> 30:04.301
Yeah.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.703
Are you all right?

30:09.475 --> 30:13.110
Looks like you need some
hydration.

30:14.246 --> 30:15.546
Thank you.

30:15.548 --> 30:17.748
So, where are you guys from?

30:17.750 --> 30:19.767
I'm from Samoa.

30:19.768 --> 30:21.785
Samoa? That is definitely on my
list of places I wanna visit.

30:21.787 --> 30:23.153
Oh, yes, please. Where you from?

30:23.155 --> 30:27.791
I'm English. But my dad's
Scottish and my mum's Irish, so.

30:27.793 --> 30:30.260
Irish? I'm Irish too.

30:31.197 --> 30:31.862
Really?

30:31.864 --> 30:35.866
Yeah. 'Irish' you're my
girlfriend.

30:35.868 --> 30:38.202
That's cute.

30:38.270 --> 30:41.305
Yeah. And why would Popo be
coming up here?

30:41.307 --> 30:46.810
Nordic poles.
Easy for walking. See you.

30:46.812 --> 30:48.745
- I'm Bob.
- Kelly.

30:48.747 --> 30:50.380
It's a pleasure to make your
acquaintance,

30:50.382 --> 30:55.686
especially in a setting that's
almost as beautiful as you.

30:55.688 --> 30:58.121
May I ask you a question?

30:58.123 --> 30:59.389
Uh, OK.

30:59.391 --> 31:01.225
You know, we've just finished a
five-hour trek.

31:01.227 --> 31:04.394
- Two hours?
- Yep, two-hour trek.

31:04.396 --> 31:06.897
What would you do next?

31:07.233 --> 31:10.033
Uh... Well, we'll probably
grab a cold one.

31:10.035 --> 31:12.236
Oh, an ice block?

31:12.238 --> 31:16.373
- Where from?
- There's a place close by.

31:17.343 --> 31:19.409
Oh, nice.

31:42.067 --> 31:44.735
Hi, how are you? How's it going?

31:44.737 --> 31:47.804
Can I speak with your manager,
please?

31:53.946 --> 31:59.616
Free drinks for anyone
that can beat me.

32:00.586 --> 32:03.020
So you're the manager.

32:04.123 --> 32:05.756
I could be.

32:05.758 --> 32:09.493
I got a few questions I need
to ask you.

32:09.495 --> 32:11.762
- You police?
- No.

32:11.830 --> 32:16.633
But I'm looking for a Samoan
man, mid-20s, not local.

32:16.635 --> 32:19.136
But he looks like this.

32:26.912 --> 32:29.212
It'll cost you.

32:29.615 --> 32:30.948
How much?

32:30.950 --> 32:32.649
500.

32:32.651 --> 32:36.186
That's a little bit
over my budget.

32:36.188 --> 32:38.388
No deal.

32:40.726 --> 32:41.959
What...

32:41.961 --> 32:43.660
if I...

32:43.662 --> 32:45.062
could beat...

32:45.064 --> 32:47.364
you?

32:50.636 --> 32:51.835
You think...

32:51.837 --> 32:54.805
that you...

32:55.708 --> 32:57.574
can beat...

32:57.576 --> 32:59.910
me?

33:04.249 --> 33:07.684
- I've got something better.
- Oh?

34:09.348 --> 34:10.348
OK.

34:13.118 --> 34:16.620
Yeah, I got this, I got this.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.208
- Right, boss.
- Yeah.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.077
- I'm the boss.
- Let's do this!

34:40.079 --> 34:42.679
- Let's do this.
- Shirts off!

35:25.824 --> 35:28.091
Oh.

35:28.293 --> 35:30.527
Oh my gosh.

35:32.464 --> 35:35.899
It's when you took your
shirt off.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.904
Uh...

36:18.777 --> 36:23.880
Uh... We'll cross that bridge
when we get to the...

36:23.882 --> 36:26.082
bridge.

36:30.556 --> 36:34.724
- Popo's in there?
- Yes. We're getting closer.

36:34.726 --> 36:37.327
How we gonna find him
in all of that?

36:37.329 --> 36:41.097
How do you find a needle
in a haystack?

36:41.733 --> 36:44.034
You eat the hay.

36:44.036 --> 36:46.303
So simple.

36:47.506 --> 36:49.072
What we gonna do now?

36:49.074 --> 36:51.107
We need to get into his head.

36:51.109 --> 36:51.775
Not this again.

36:51.777 --> 36:55.612
If you had money and a
pretty girl, what would you do?

36:55.614 --> 36:58.415
Marry the girl and use the money
for the wedding.

36:58.417 --> 37:02.352
No. You'd go into town,
you'd have a great time,

37:02.354 --> 37:05.822
and because you got money,
you'd get yourself a hotel room.

37:05.824 --> 37:08.792
You wake up in the morning,
you're staring in the horizon;

37:08.794 --> 37:11.995
You look at the biggest tree in
the concrete jungle

37:11.997 --> 37:16.933
and you think to yourself,
'I want to climb that!'

37:27.446 --> 37:31.414
Uh, chicken. I wasn't happy with
those goats we got last time.

37:31.416 --> 37:35.018
- Really?
- Well, who wants diabetic goats

37:35.020 --> 37:37.721
at a party? It's not ideal.

37:38.123 --> 37:41.224
I'd like those goats
that eat gorse,

37:41.226 --> 37:43.893
cos it's a real problem at the
moment.

37:43.895 --> 37:45.595
- Did you get that?
- Yeah, I got it.

37:45.597 --> 37:48.098
I just can't spell it.

37:50.836 --> 37:52.302
And chicken.

37:52.304 --> 37:55.405
Alama, I'll go left.
You go right.

37:55.407 --> 37:56.373
Look at how high we are.

37:56.375 --> 37:59.442
You go left.
We'll both go left.

37:59.444 --> 38:00.677
Oh, OK.

38:00.679 --> 38:03.280
Keep your eyes and ears peeled.

38:03.282 --> 38:05.749
We need to surround him.

38:06.785 --> 38:09.219
Alama, he's not up here.

38:11.089 --> 38:13.390
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

38:13.392 --> 38:15.692
Yeah! Ah-hoo-hoo!

38:16.128 --> 38:18.461
Whoo! Ah-hoo-hoo!

38:23.535 --> 38:26.703
Yeah! Ohh! Man, it was amazing.

38:26.705 --> 38:29.406
I bet it was. I mean, that high!

38:29.408 --> 38:34.644
- There's my dawn warrior.
- Oh, and there's the other one!

38:34.646 --> 38:36.546
That was awesome, man!

38:37.716 --> 38:40.150
So this is what Popo's been
doing with your money.

38:40.152 --> 38:42.919
I see everything from
there. I can see the tree.

38:42.921 --> 38:46.656
- It's beautiful just like you.
- Oh, really?

38:46.658 --> 38:49.225
Oh my gosh.

39:02.541 --> 39:04.441
Alama, get him!

39:04.443 --> 39:06.843
Aah! My hamstrings!

39:11.149 --> 39:13.583
Right behind you, Alama!

39:13.585 --> 39:15.885
Ss! Ss! Ssah!

39:17.155 --> 39:20.323
- Bob!
- Just around the corner!

39:29.534 --> 39:33.103
You're not allowed to
run up hills!

39:36.608 --> 39:38.241
Sole!

39:38.243 --> 39:39.609
Mate, I'm in a high-speed
pursuit

39:39.611 --> 39:42.011
and I'm gonna need your
transportation. Can I use it?

39:42.013 --> 39:44.547
- Yeah.
- Thanks, man.

39:44.850 --> 39:46.583
Where's the rest of your bike,
man?

39:46.585 --> 39:47.751
- Right here.
- Oh mate.

39:47.753 --> 39:50.620
That's right. Strong core.
That's it. That's it.

39:50.622 --> 39:53.022
Yeah, I remember.
It's all coming back.

39:56.762 --> 39:58.995
Oh. Something wrong with the...

39:58.997 --> 40:01.564
Once you put your bike
together, then I'll be back.

40:01.566 --> 40:04.134
- Thanks mate.
- All right. Good luck.

40:24.456 --> 40:29.492
Bob Titilo has done it
again! Come on. Hurry up!

40:29.494 --> 40:31.461
Alama, he's getting away.

40:31.463 --> 40:35.365
Come on, driver, let's go.
High speed.

40:37.602 --> 40:40.737
Hey, Popo, this is my town.

40:41.473 --> 40:44.407
Get him, get him! Go on, go on!

40:52.517 --> 40:56.519
Let's go! Let's go! Come on,
this is a high-speed chase.

40:56.521 --> 40:58.888
Yeah! Whoo!

40:59.024 --> 41:03.560
- Gonna get you, Popo!
- This is what you call real!

41:03.562 --> 41:05.028
Gonna get you, Popo!

41:05.030 --> 41:07.964
This way, this way, this way!

41:26.251 --> 41:28.651
Popo, stop. Just stop.

41:29.621 --> 41:30.620
Stop.

41:30.622 --> 41:32.755
- He's not stopping.
- Tackle him.

41:32.757 --> 41:35.959
It's a moving vehicle.
It's too dangerous.

41:35.961 --> 41:41.331
Driver, driver, please stop.
Please stop here, please.

41:41.333 --> 41:42.999
Get him. Get him!

41:43.001 --> 41:45.068
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. It's 20 bucks.

41:45.070 --> 41:46.736
- Huh?
- 20 bucks.

41:46.738 --> 41:49.105
2... 2... Uh...

42:52.938 --> 42:55.271
Sole, you, um...

42:56.007 --> 42:58.508
You found me.

42:59.611 --> 43:01.177
Well done.

43:55.900 --> 43:58.001
Oh!

44:05.944 --> 44:08.111
Popo?

44:08.346 --> 44:10.680
No. No, no. Just let him go.

44:10.682 --> 44:12.548
- Let him go.
- What?

44:12.550 --> 44:14.117
No, just let him go.

44:14.119 --> 44:16.486
Let him go.

44:43.181 --> 44:45.448
Yeah.

44:48.687 --> 44:49.285
Thanks, Alama.

44:49.287 --> 44:52.855
Next time just leave him to me.
Don't try to take him.

44:52.857 --> 44:56.959
I know what to expect.
I've got a few surprises myself.

44:56.961 --> 44:59.595
Look, we found him once.
We can find him again.

44:59.597 --> 45:02.465
And how are we gonna do that?

45:04.035 --> 45:06.169
Here.

45:10.642 --> 45:13.976
- Why would he do that?
- Exactly.

45:29.728 --> 45:30.326
- Hi.
- Hi.

45:30.328 --> 45:32.061
- How are you?
- Yeah, good, thank you.

45:32.063 --> 45:35.898
- How are you?
- Yeah, good. Take a seat.

45:35.900 --> 45:36.232
Wow.

45:36.234 --> 45:38.434
Welcome to wine tasting for
beginners.

45:38.436 --> 45:42.538
It's your first step towards
expanding your knowledge

45:42.540 --> 45:43.840
and appreciation for wine.

45:43.842 --> 45:46.576
Boy, do we have a treat in store
for you tonight.

45:46.578 --> 45:50.179
What wine do you have for a man
who have no money

45:50.181 --> 45:53.483
in his wallet but a lot of love
in his heart.

45:53.485 --> 45:57.754
Samoan man, mid to late 20s,
sampled any wine lately?

45:57.756 --> 46:01.591
Um, yeah, actually, in the
previous session.

46:01.593 --> 46:05.862
He was a very generous tipper.

46:06.431 --> 46:09.966
- Where did he go to next?
- Well, it's Saturday night,

46:09.968 --> 46:12.435
so I'm guessing the club
up the road.

46:12.437 --> 46:13.836
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

46:13.838 --> 46:16.906
You're not gonna have a taste?

46:18.276 --> 46:20.409
Uh...

46:21.012 --> 46:23.045
Just a little bit.

46:23.114 --> 46:26.949
- Stay away.
- Don't do it.

46:26.951 --> 46:28.251
This isn't you, Bob Titilo.

46:28.253 --> 46:31.687
You know, I would've been in
the Warriors.

46:31.689 --> 46:35.324
Could've been in the
police force, a navy SEAL.

46:35.326 --> 46:38.161
Could've been a commander
in the army.

46:38.163 --> 46:41.197
Could've been the first Samoan
man on the moon.

46:41.199 --> 46:43.466
- Really?
- Prime minister of New Zealand.

46:43.468 --> 46:44.600
What are you talking about?

46:44.602 --> 46:46.335
Could've been a nutritionalist.

46:46.337 --> 46:49.038
Could've ran a
two-mile marathon.

46:49.040 --> 46:50.239
I coulda had a three-pack abs.

46:50.241 --> 46:53.876
Could've swam the Cook Strait
on the ferry.

46:53.878 --> 46:56.312
Are you from, like, around here?

46:56.314 --> 46:57.313
I'm from Samoa.

46:57.315 --> 47:00.783
Samoa? Oh my goodness,
that's the most beautiful place.

47:00.785 --> 47:04.587
Could've done so much.

47:05.390 --> 47:07.890
Oh, yes!

47:12.197 --> 47:13.930
We are looking for my brother.

47:13.932 --> 47:16.332
- Well, I hope you find him.
- Yeah.

47:16.334 --> 47:19.569
Hey, um, where did
your friend go?

47:22.907 --> 47:25.007
Bob?

47:25.009 --> 47:26.943
Bob!

47:31.583 --> 47:33.616
You can't catch me!

47:33.618 --> 47:36.018
Hey! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

47:38.356 --> 47:41.791
Phwoar! It's been a long time.

47:41.793 --> 47:43.025
Hi, tree.

47:43.027 --> 47:43.593
Ohh!

47:43.595 --> 47:45.962
I am Bob Chichilo.

47:46.197 --> 47:49.332
Hey, Popo. Oh, that's not Popo.

47:49.901 --> 47:52.835
Excuse me, have you seen Popo?

47:52.837 --> 47:54.470
He's about this tall.

47:54.472 --> 47:55.571
He's like that.

47:55.573 --> 47:58.374
Very naughty. Naughty boy!

47:58.877 --> 48:00.076
Oh, I can feel it.

48:00.078 --> 48:00.977
Whoa!

48:00.979 --> 48:01.477
Oh!

48:01.479 --> 48:03.045
Whoo-hoo!

48:03.047 --> 48:05.381
I am Aquaman!

48:24.269 --> 48:26.702
No more fishing for you.

48:33.811 --> 48:36.078
Hey!

48:36.080 --> 48:38.381
What...? Are you talking to me?

48:38.383 --> 48:42.551
Hey! You-You wanna piece of
this?

48:43.154 --> 48:45.988
You want a piece of this?

48:45.990 --> 48:47.623
Hey?

48:47.625 --> 48:48.457
Come on.

48:48.459 --> 48:51.661
I'm gonna give you a real jab
in your face.

48:51.663 --> 48:55.331
I'm been training.
Training really hard.

48:55.333 --> 48:57.800
Yeah.

48:58.202 --> 49:03.539
You see that upper cut?
Coming your way.

49:03.541 --> 49:05.808
I am Bob Titilo,

49:06.711 --> 49:09.111
private investigator.

49:09.113 --> 49:11.380
There's no way...

49:11.382 --> 49:13.049
There's no way

49:13.051 --> 49:15.618
you can take me over!

49:16.387 --> 49:17.853
Oh my God!

49:17.855 --> 49:19.288
Elbow, wrist-bow,

49:19.290 --> 49:20.556
finger-bow, knee-bow.

49:20.558 --> 49:23.859
You are gonna bow down to me.

49:25.596 --> 49:28.230
You want me to smash this on
your head?

49:28.232 --> 49:30.900
Huh? Ha, you can't fool me.

49:31.536 --> 49:33.536
Aahh!

49:36.240 --> 49:37.707
You think that hurt?

49:37.709 --> 49:40.676
No, it was painful.

49:42.146 --> 49:44.246
- All right, all right.
- Stop it!

49:44.248 --> 49:44.914
Stop it, Alama!

49:44.916 --> 49:46.148
It's not worth it.
You'll just get hurt.

49:46.150 --> 49:50.786
You can't contain me.
Stop trying to be a container.

49:50.788 --> 49:52.722
Wait! OK!

49:52.724 --> 49:54.290
- OK?
- OK, yeah.

49:54.292 --> 49:56.459
- Calm down.
- I'm good.

49:56.461 --> 49:58.294
Look... Yaaah!

49:58.296 --> 50:00.629
Stop it, Alama. Get away.

50:00.631 --> 50:03.466
- That's enough.
- Get away!

50:04.402 --> 50:06.569
Wha...?

50:28.092 --> 50:30.493
What's wrong with you?

50:33.498 --> 50:38.768
I'm sorry, Alama. Every Superman
has his kryptonite.

50:39.604 --> 50:41.303
What is kryptonite?

50:41.305 --> 50:42.738
It's a... You don't understand.

50:42.740 --> 50:46.675
This is a waste of time. You're
supposed to be helping me.

50:46.677 --> 50:49.111
I am! I am, I promise.

50:49.113 --> 50:52.048
- I'll help you.
- Forget it.

50:52.050 --> 50:55.017
Hey. Where you going?

50:55.153 --> 50:57.653
- Let go.
- Let go or what?

50:58.389 --> 51:02.291
I'm trying to make you see
the errors of your ways.

51:02.293 --> 51:04.493
- Just step away.
- Or else what?

51:04.495 --> 51:06.062
You think you can take me?

51:06.064 --> 51:08.197
You think you can take
Bob Titilo?

51:08.199 --> 51:09.665
- Yes, I do.
- Hey?

51:09.667 --> 51:10.733
Here, take this.

51:10.735 --> 51:12.034
Aahh!

51:12.036 --> 51:14.870
Right where I want you.

51:14.872 --> 51:17.106
Enough.

51:17.975 --> 51:19.675
I got styles too.

51:19.677 --> 51:22.445
I got snake.

51:22.447 --> 51:24.046
I got a horse.

51:24.048 --> 51:27.049
I got a elephant.

51:27.819 --> 51:30.786
Two trunks. Eh?

51:30.788 --> 51:34.423
And I got a banana style. You
know what I can do with that?

51:34.425 --> 51:37.126
I can peel your face. Aahh!

51:39.564 --> 51:41.897
You don't listen.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.100
Uh?

51:44.102 --> 51:45.734
What you gonna do with no money?

51:45.736 --> 51:48.537
Huh? You don't even know where
you're going.

51:48.539 --> 51:51.373
Every time you try something,
you stuff it up.

51:51.375 --> 51:55.478
I saw an opportunity and
evaluated the situation

51:55.480 --> 51:57.346
and acted accordingly.

51:57.348 --> 51:59.849
Big words doesn't make you
less wrong.

51:59.851 --> 52:03.018
That's it!

52:03.020 --> 52:03.586
We're finished!

52:03.588 --> 52:09.725
You can go back to the islands
the same way you came - broke!

52:10.928 --> 52:13.195
Can you not bring your dramas
around here?

52:13.197 --> 52:14.663
Yeah, cos you're kind of killing
our vibe.

52:14.665 --> 52:17.800
Well, can you not bring
your faces in public?

52:17.802 --> 52:21.103
Cos your kind of killing
my eyes.

52:46.864 --> 52:48.564
That guy doesn't look too good.

52:48.566 --> 52:49.665
We should check him.

52:49.667 --> 52:53.269
- No, he's fine.
- Oh, sorry. Sorry.

52:54.172 --> 52:56.305
Are you OK? Do you need help?

52:56.307 --> 52:58.641
No. No, I'm fine.

53:01.879 --> 53:03.779
I mean yes.

53:03.781 --> 53:04.680
Are you hurt?

53:04.682 --> 53:06.081
Oh!

53:06.083 --> 53:08.484
Actually, I'm in a lot of pain.

53:08.486 --> 53:09.185
Are you sure?

53:09.187 --> 53:12.221
Cos if you're lying,
I'm gonna hurt you for real.

53:12.223 --> 53:14.924
I think we should take him to
hospital.

53:14.926 --> 53:19.495
No, he needs some physical and
psychological healing.

53:19.497 --> 53:21.964
And I know what he needs.

53:27.438 --> 53:30.573
It's always the ones closest
to you, eh?

53:30.575 --> 53:33.742
What would you do if you don't
get your money back?

53:33.744 --> 53:37.546
Well, I'll go back home with
nothing.

53:39.083 --> 53:40.649
- Here, take this.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

53:40.651 --> 53:43.919
It's not much. Take it.
Hopefully it will help.

53:49.260 --> 53:51.293
$2.

53:51.862 --> 53:55.998
We got to go. We're gonna be late
for church. Here.

53:56.000 --> 53:59.401
- Fa'afetai lava.
- Look after yourself.

53:59.403 --> 54:01.403
Let's go.

54:01.405 --> 54:03.839
- Fa.
- Fa soifua.

54:05.176 --> 54:06.775
So you're just going to
leave it?

54:06.777 --> 54:10.379
Yes. Mum, I can't work in
an environment

54:10.381 --> 54:12.214
where I'm not appreciated.

54:12.216 --> 54:15.718
Why is Alama so desperate to get
his money back?

54:15.720 --> 54:17.620
- I don't know.
- How much was stolen?

54:17.622 --> 54:18.621
Mum, I didn't ask.

54:18.623 --> 54:21.223
Why would he want
to overstay his visa?

54:21.225 --> 54:23.425
Mum, I don't even think it's
relevant.

54:23.427 --> 54:24.893
Oh!

54:24.895 --> 54:28.230
Son, you're a crap investigator.

54:28.366 --> 54:31.700
You're 40, unemployed
and still living at home.

54:31.702 --> 54:34.803
Yeah, but it's a nice home, Mum.

54:34.872 --> 54:37.873
How many times have I told you
to stay away from-?

54:37.875 --> 54:41.443
Wow, wow. Thanks, Mum, for the
vote of confidence?

54:41.445 --> 54:45.914
Now, you listen and listen
carefully, son.

54:46.584 --> 54:49.518
If you don't show respect for
Alama,

54:49.520 --> 54:54.823
you are no better off than the
guy that took his money.

55:04.368 --> 55:07.503
You finish what you started.
Do you hear me?

55:07.505 --> 55:10.072
Yeah, but, Mum, he's probably
long gone by now.

55:10.074 --> 55:14.043
- Based on what information?
- I'm just assuming.

55:17.415 --> 55:21.417
Popo. He's my brother,
not by blood.

55:21.419 --> 55:23.886
He's been acting strange.

55:23.888 --> 55:25.888
There's my dawn warrior!

55:25.890 --> 55:26.722
Very generous tipper.

55:26.724 --> 55:30.492
He gave me his lavalava,
so I gave him a discount.

55:30.494 --> 55:32.227
That's cute.

55:32.229 --> 55:32.961
Ko'a lua.

55:32.963 --> 55:34.930
Beautiful just like you.

55:34.932 --> 55:37.466
There's my dawn warrior.

55:49.914 --> 55:52.414
There's my dawn warrior!

55:52.550 --> 55:54.049
There's my dawn warrior!

55:54.051 --> 55:56.485
Dawn warrior!

56:05.329 --> 56:07.162
Yes. Gotcha!

56:07.164 --> 56:09.465
Don't you take him on by
yourself.

56:09.467 --> 56:11.033
You go and look for
Alama and take him-

56:11.035 --> 56:14.570
No, Mum. I'm gonna look for
someone else.

56:17.708 --> 56:20.042
Go look for Alama.

56:37.762 --> 56:40.162
The giraffe wakes up.

56:41.031 --> 56:42.765
Open up your bones!

56:42.767 --> 56:44.967
Open up the cartilage.

56:44.969 --> 56:47.403
Open up the ligaments!

56:47.838 --> 56:50.806
Build a bridge for the people.

56:52.042 --> 56:54.309
Breathe in.

56:55.813 --> 56:57.212
Sole!

56:57.214 --> 56:57.713
Hey!

56:57.715 --> 57:01.250
Tell the people it's safe
to cross.

57:12.496 --> 57:14.530
You're...

57:14.532 --> 57:16.999
I'm Bob... Faitatala.

57:18.135 --> 57:19.201
Faiamio?

57:19.203 --> 57:21.537
Fai... Bob Fa...

57:23.040 --> 57:23.639
Bob...

57:23.641 --> 57:26.008
- Bob Titilo!
- Titilo!

57:26.010 --> 57:28.510
Oh, I see what you did.

57:29.146 --> 57:31.513
Oh, you brought the power, huh?

57:31.515 --> 57:35.818
OK, well, uso, you might have
the power,

57:35.820 --> 57:39.021
but I've got the speed.

57:50.434 --> 57:52.701
Oh, come on!

57:59.510 --> 58:05.080
Hey, Popo, where's your speed
now, mate?

58:05.082 --> 58:06.915
Oh!

58:11.822 --> 58:15.390
Oh, you beauty.
A getaway vehicle.

58:17.561 --> 58:19.928
Let's go.

58:19.930 --> 58:22.297
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

58:22.533 --> 58:25.701
I knew we'll get the money back.

58:30.140 --> 58:33.542
What? He's got the bag!
Go faster!

58:34.311 --> 58:37.246
I beg your pardon?

58:37.248 --> 58:40.182
- Plan B, then.
- What's plan A?

58:40.618 --> 58:43.819
Feel the rhythm. Feel the vibe!

58:44.154 --> 58:46.822
Plan B!

58:46.824 --> 58:49.124
Yes!

58:49.493 --> 58:53.228
How do you like that Bob Titilo
special, eh, Popo?

58:53.230 --> 58:55.531
You...

58:56.667 --> 58:57.332
Hey!

58:57.334 --> 58:59.701
Ks! Ks! Ks! Aaah!

59:00.838 --> 59:03.272
Ks! Ks! Ks! Ks!

59:21.592 --> 59:23.492
Hey, that's my bike!

59:23.494 --> 59:24.760
- Hey!
- Don't worry about it.

59:24.762 --> 59:27.262
- I'll buy you a new bike.
- I need it for work tomorrow.

59:27.264 --> 59:29.865
- What do you do for work?
- Riding!

59:29.867 --> 59:32.734
Excuse me! That's my bike!

59:32.736 --> 59:34.436
Hello! Hey!

59:34.438 --> 59:37.205
That's my bike!

59:40.511 --> 59:42.611
Sole!

01:00:22.653 --> 01:00:24.920
I found Popo.

01:00:26.490 --> 01:00:28.890
Did you get the money?

01:00:29.226 --> 01:00:31.660
No. He got away again.

01:00:53.651 --> 01:00:57.486
Popo and I always dream of
coming here.

01:00:58.455 --> 01:01:00.589
I like it here too.

01:01:00.658 --> 01:01:04.326
But if we are both here, then
there's nobody back home.

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:07.996
Yeah, but you can always send
money back home to help.

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:10.465
Money pay for things,

01:01:10.901 --> 01:01:14.903
but it doesn't stop your parents
from being lonely.

01:01:14.905 --> 01:01:18.640
It doesn't remind them to take
their medicine,

01:01:18.642 --> 01:01:23.011
or even tell jokes just to make
them laugh.

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:26.748
Popo doesn't get that in his
head.

01:01:28.552 --> 01:01:30.185
I'm sorry.

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:32.621
What was that?

01:01:32.622 --> 01:01:35.056
I'm slowly getting a cough.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:39.261
Alama, I'm really sorry.

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:42.164
Sorry for everything.

01:01:42.166 --> 01:01:44.433
Ah, it's all right.

01:01:44.435 --> 01:01:46.568
Thank you for helping me.

01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:51.139
You're the only one who came out
and helped me.

01:01:51.141 --> 01:01:53.208
Thanks for...

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:55.577
being a friend.

01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:58.213
Like... best friends?

01:01:58.215 --> 01:01:58.680
Nah, friends.

01:01:58.682 --> 01:02:00.816
One more step and
then best friends, eh?

01:02:00.818 --> 01:02:03.385
- 12 steps.
- 12 steps?

01:02:05.422 --> 01:02:08.890
You know what? We're gonna
get that money.

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:13.061
But this time we're gonna do it
together.

01:02:14.198 --> 01:02:16.465
Like a team!

01:02:17.701 --> 01:02:19.935
Like usos.

01:02:21.839 --> 01:02:23.205
Yeah!

01:02:23.207 --> 01:02:25.574
Feel like an idiot.

01:02:27.811 --> 01:02:29.945
Yeah, we'll do it together.

01:02:29.947 --> 01:02:30.679
Best friends!

01:02:30.681 --> 01:02:33.215
Nearly best friends.

01:02:33.217 --> 01:02:35.417
So how are we gonna find him
now?

01:02:35.419 --> 01:02:38.220
We can't do it by ourselves.

01:02:55.606 --> 01:02:58.740
Today I'm going to teach you how
to do the lima tau.

01:02:58.742 --> 01:03:00.075
- Limatow.
- Li-ma tau.

01:03:00.077 --> 01:03:01.376
- Leematayau.
- Tau. Tau.

01:03:01.378 --> 01:03:02.744
- Tayow.
- Tau. Tau.

01:03:02.746 --> 01:03:06.281
- Haua.
- Tau. Samoan martial art.

01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:07.949
OK, if someone's attack you...

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:09.918
- Yeah.
- Show me how you block.

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.186
Raah!

01:03:11.188 --> 01:03:14.823
- Wow. What is that?
- Well, did you hit my face?

01:03:14.825 --> 01:03:17.626
- No.
- Then that's a block.

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:25.567
Bro, is this you?

01:03:25.569 --> 01:03:27.736
No!

01:03:27.871 --> 01:03:29.471
Isn't this your man?

01:03:29.473 --> 01:03:32.641
What?

01:03:40.751 --> 01:03:42.450
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:03:42.452 --> 01:03:44.553
- Yeah.
- Whoa! Got it.

01:03:44.555 --> 01:03:46.822
- This one you're gonna block.
- Yeah.

01:03:46.824 --> 01:03:48.290
- This one is for the slap.
- Ohh!

01:03:48.292 --> 01:03:49.591
- You see?
- Of course, of course.

01:03:49.593 --> 01:03:50.892
And the same time with both
of them.

01:03:50.894 --> 01:03:53.528
- Yes, yes, I know.
- You ready? Go.

01:03:55.132 --> 01:03:56.331
No.

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:58.266
Ready.

01:04:02.806 --> 01:04:03.905
No.

01:04:03.907 --> 01:04:05.340
No. No.

01:04:05.342 --> 01:04:06.174
No.

01:04:06.176 --> 01:04:08.577
Hoo-ahh!

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:11.146
No.

01:04:11.148 --> 01:04:12.181
No.

01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:13.215
How many fingers am
I holding up?

01:04:13.217 --> 01:04:15.684
- Two.
- Whoaaa! Ohh!

01:04:16.687 --> 01:04:17.886
See?

01:04:36.773 --> 01:04:37.873
Aah!

01:04:48.518 --> 01:04:51.052
Yo! Yo! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:04:52.222 --> 01:04:54.823
Come on, real Fa'asamoa!

01:04:58.061 --> 01:05:01.963
Can you do that softer?

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:06.134
Blockslap. Blockslaaaap! Raaah!

01:05:06.136 --> 01:05:06.768
Yaaah!

01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:08.737
I think I make you worse
than before.

01:05:08.739 --> 01:05:11.006
Better if you just stick
to what you're good at.

01:05:11.008 --> 01:05:13.775
- OK.
- What are you good at?

01:05:15.212 --> 01:05:18.013
Let me show you my skill of how
to stay hidden.

01:05:18.015 --> 01:05:21.583
Can you see me behind the chair?

01:05:22.019 --> 01:05:24.986
Ha, ha! I was behind the tree.

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:28.790
Nice try.

01:05:31.561 --> 01:05:34.896
I said to the Australian,
'You're a platypus!'

01:05:34.898 --> 01:05:37.499
A platypus!

01:05:51.682 --> 01:05:54.449
Now, that's what you
call a platypus.

01:06:02.426 --> 01:06:04.759
They found him.

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:11.866
I've got an address.

01:06:58.415 --> 01:07:00.115
Come on, Alama.

01:07:00.117 --> 01:07:02.484
Popo!

01:07:02.953 --> 01:07:04.119
Check over there.

01:07:04.121 --> 01:07:06.588
Popo!

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:12.727
Popo!

01:07:13.764 --> 01:07:16.031
Can you hear anything?

01:07:16.033 --> 01:07:17.932
No.

01:07:19.636 --> 01:07:22.203
There!

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.907
Watch out.

01:07:27.978 --> 01:07:29.611
Popo!

01:07:29.613 --> 01:07:32.347
You go first.

01:07:42.926 --> 01:07:45.427
Lucky I came prepared.

01:07:54.371 --> 01:07:56.638
Alama.

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:58.540
Alama?

01:07:58.542 --> 01:08:00.742
Um...

01:08:04.581 --> 01:08:06.448
Can't trust my eyes.

01:08:06.450 --> 01:08:08.683
Gonna have to use my ears.

01:08:15.459 --> 01:08:17.192
Alama?

01:08:17.194 --> 01:08:18.126
Are you there?

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:19.828
Oh!

01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:22.296
Alama, are you there?

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:35.210
Wow, what a skux dude.

01:08:35.812 --> 01:08:37.412
Bob.

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:38.078
Oh my gosh.

01:08:38.081 --> 01:08:41.716
- Why are your eyes closed?
- Because I was trying to...

01:08:41.718 --> 01:08:45.587
- Come on, hurry up.
- OK, yeah.

01:08:56.733 --> 01:08:57.832
Let's check upstairs.

01:08:57.834 --> 01:08:59.834
No, I don't think he's gone
upstairs.

01:08:59.836 --> 01:09:04.104
I'm sure he's staying on
flat surfaces now.

01:09:05.675 --> 01:09:08.710
He's got to be here somewhere.

01:09:11.581 --> 01:09:13.747
There.

01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:25.493
Enough mucking around, Popo.

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:36.604
Lama.

01:09:38.041 --> 01:09:40.108
Why the rush for?

01:09:51.388 --> 01:09:53.988
Lama...

01:10:02.232 --> 01:10:04.699
I'm not going back.

01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:07.402
This is not our home, Popo.

01:10:09.072 --> 01:10:10.505
If that's our home, Lama,

01:10:10.507 --> 01:10:13.908
then why hasn't anybody else
gone back?

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:16.544
All we do is work for them.

01:10:20.684 --> 01:10:25.220
It's the same thing over and
over again.

01:10:34.864 --> 01:10:37.298
If you want it, then...

01:10:39.769 --> 01:10:42.070
come and get it.

01:11:10.133 --> 01:11:12.734
There.

01:11:17.907 --> 01:11:20.508
Oof!

01:11:21.645 --> 01:11:25.046
Look, it says,
'Lama, come get me!

01:11:25.048 --> 01:11:27.582
'I'm waiting for you.'

01:11:27.584 --> 01:11:29.284
Let's go, Lama.

01:11:29.286 --> 01:11:33.588
Show me the stupid moves
our dad showed you.

01:11:38.762 --> 01:11:40.895
OK.

01:12:01.184 --> 01:12:03.451
Go home, Lama.

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:39.387
Sau.

01:14:58.428 --> 01:15:01.462
I am not going back.

01:15:07.871 --> 01:15:10.505
What the...?

01:15:14.377 --> 01:15:17.178
- It's you!
- Yes, me.

01:15:21.551 --> 01:15:25.052
- Alama, you've got this.
- No.

01:15:25.054 --> 01:15:27.021
We got this.

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:27.421
Together.

01:15:27.423 --> 01:15:29.957
- Best friends?
- Nearly best friends.

01:15:29.959 --> 01:15:32.727
Now get him!

01:15:34.764 --> 01:15:37.765
You all right? Alama.

01:15:41.504 --> 01:15:44.171
You've got him.

01:15:49.012 --> 01:15:51.979
Hey!

01:15:51.981 --> 01:15:54.181
Get him!

01:15:54.183 --> 01:15:54.916
Yeah.

01:15:54.918 --> 01:15:57.485
- How's that feel now?
- That's enough, Popo!

01:15:57.487 --> 01:15:59.887
That's enough, Popo.

01:16:00.056 --> 01:16:02.924
I said enough, Popo.

01:16:02.926 --> 01:16:05.159
That's two enoughs.

01:16:17.574 --> 01:16:19.807
I knew you'd get him, Alama.

01:16:19.809 --> 01:16:22.510
Both of us did it together.

01:16:22.579 --> 01:16:28.783
That's what happens when you
mess with best friends, Popo.

01:16:28.785 --> 01:16:33.054
Hey, best friend.
Guess what I got for you.

01:16:50.273 --> 01:16:52.306
What's he laughing about, Alama?

01:17:01.351 --> 01:17:03.818
I spent it on good times.

01:17:04.387 --> 01:17:09.423
It's just like our family.
All that work for nothing!

01:17:58.508 --> 01:18:02.643
Alama, I've still got some
oranges left.

01:18:15.191 --> 01:18:17.625
Popo...

01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:37.111
Yeah.

01:18:49.158 --> 01:18:50.391
Sorry, Mum.

01:18:50.393 --> 01:18:53.060
Stuck together.

01:19:15.818 --> 01:19:18.753
Sorry, Alama, we couldn't get
your money back.

01:19:18.755 --> 01:19:21.922
That's all right.
It's not your fault.

01:19:21.924 --> 01:19:26.227
Here's something to take back
to Samoa.

01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:27.995
Thank you, man.

01:19:27.997 --> 01:19:30.731
Well, you better practise those
moves, huh?

01:19:30.733 --> 01:19:33.300
Every day.

01:19:33.302 --> 01:19:35.669
Take care, huh?

01:19:42.178 --> 01:19:45.146
- Fa, Alama.
- Fa soifua.

01:19:45.148 --> 01:19:45.713
Fa, Bob.

01:19:45.715 --> 01:19:48.249
- Fa, Alama.
- Fa.

01:21:18.374 --> 01:21:19.907
Shit.

01:21:19.909 --> 01:21:22.376
Huh?

01:21:22.712 --> 01:21:25.179
Hey!

01:23:36.479 --> 01:23:39.046
Bob Titilo.

01:25:13.943 --> 01:25:16.143
Heeeey!

01:25:16.645 --> 01:25:19.012
What a useless boys!

01:25:24.353 --> 01:25:26.687
I living the high life!

01:25:26.689 --> 01:25:28.122
A new Hilux!

01:25:28.124 --> 01:25:30.891
New hat, new watch.

01:27:30.713 --> 01:27:33.413
Hoo!

01:27:33.983 --> 01:27:36.450
Yeah.

01:28:41.083 --> 01:28:43.350
Sorry, Lama.

01:30:04.032 --> 01:30:06.433
Yep, cool.

01:30:15.611 --> 01:30:17.611
Heyyy!

01:30:49.278 --> 01:30:51.578
Whooo-hoo-hoo!

01:30:55.851 --> 01:30:57.417
Oh, wow.

01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:06.960
Malo!

01:31:17.873 --> 01:31:18.572
There is Apolima.

01:31:18.574 --> 01:31:22.542
That big island over there,
that's Savai'i.

01:31:25.881 --> 01:31:27.180
Go to the fire show?

01:31:27.182 --> 01:31:29.816
Yes, can you bring us to the
fire show.

01:31:29.818 --> 01:31:32.853
Faster.

01:31:34.590 --> 01:31:35.956
Fa'afetai lava.

01:31:37.526 --> 01:31:40.494
Oh, $10. Ooh-hoo-hoo!

01:31:48.837 --> 01:31:51.137
Fa! Fa soifua.

01:31:59.948 --> 01:32:02.215
Malo.

01:32:31.713 --> 01:32:33.713
Yeah, these are all the
palm trees o Taumeasina.

01:32:33.715 --> 01:32:37.217
- Hey, talofa.
- Hi. How are you?

01:32:37.219 --> 01:32:38.685
- Very well, thank you.
- Thank you.

01:32:38.687 --> 01:32:43.590
There, there. Ready to see a bit
of the island?

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.902
Ah! Girls, I love you too!

01:32:59.908 --> 01:33:02.309
Thank you very much.

01:33:25.067 --> 01:33:27.300
Popo. Hello, Bob.

01:33:27.302 --> 01:33:28.935
- Sole!
- Hey!

01:33:28.937 --> 01:33:31.304
Alama! Hey, Popo!

01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:33.673
Malo soifua, Bob.

01:33:33.675 --> 01:33:35.575
Hey, look. Check this.

01:33:36.411 --> 01:33:39.145
Got the electric motor for it.
Is that the right size?

01:33:39.147 --> 01:33:40.747
Yeah, that's the right one.

01:33:40.749 --> 01:33:42.682
And it should get there by
next week.

01:33:42.684 --> 01:33:43.483
Oh, cool.

01:33:43.485 --> 01:33:44.517
You been practising your moves?

01:33:44.519 --> 01:33:47.120
Oh yeah. Every day, mate.
Every day.

01:33:47.122 --> 01:33:48.989
You wanna see what I got?

01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:53.860
Ooh!

01:33:53.862 --> 01:33:55.729
I'm gonna be using those
moves tonight.

01:33:55.731 --> 01:33:57.597
