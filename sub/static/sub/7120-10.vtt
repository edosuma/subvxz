00:35.393 --> 00:37.122
Hey, Jake, give me
some of that apple.

00:37.194 --> 00:38.194
Coming up.

00:41.727 --> 00:43.047
I know what you're
thinking about.

00:43.294 --> 00:44.124
Huh?

00:44.194 --> 00:45.126
Kissing

00:45.194 --> 00:46.474
Princess Bubblegum on the mouth!

00:48.627 --> 00:49.627
No, I'm not!

00:49.694 --> 00:51.456
And I wouldn't
even do that ever.

00:51.527 --> 00:52.585
Yeah, you would.

00:52.661 --> 00:54.356
You're just bad at
talking to ladies.

00:54.428 --> 00:55.486
Hmph!

00:55.562 --> 00:57.028
Ehggg-uh-ya-uh.

00:57.094 --> 00:58.959
Uh, should I keep going, Mrs.
Yoder?

00:59.029 --> 01:01.258
No, Finn, that's plenty.
Thank you.

01:01.329 --> 01:02.159
Okay.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.539
Let us know if you
need anything else.

01:03.563 --> 01:04.393
Hyah!

01:04.462 --> 01:05.895
You two are heroes!

01:05.963 --> 01:06.963
Hunh!

01:07.030 --> 01:08.088
Come on, dude.

01:08.163 --> 01:09.528
Hey, do you hear that?

01:09.597 --> 01:10.597
She called us heroes.

01:11.664 --> 01:12.562
Yeah, I heard.

01:12.630 --> 01:13.460
Huh?

01:13.530 --> 01:14.656
Hey! How's it going?!

01:16.398 --> 01:17.330
Ugh!

01:17.398 --> 01:20.126
Is that true, what
the bird said?

01:20.198 --> 01:22.223
You guys are heroes?

01:22.299 --> 01:24.095
Why are you hiding
in that shrub?

01:24.165 --> 01:25.462
Oh, I wasn't hiding.

01:25.532 --> 01:26.998
I'm a Tree Witch.

01:27.065 --> 01:29.192
I can turn into trees and shrubs

01:29.265 --> 01:30.755
and bushes and stuff.

01:30.833 --> 01:32.562
Check it out.

01:37.500 --> 01:38.331
Bleh.

01:38.401 --> 01:40.561
So, listen, I need you two

01:40.634 --> 01:43.067
heroes to get me a
lock of Princess hair.

01:44.034 --> 01:45.660
Why do you need Princess hair?

01:45.733 --> 01:46.564
Why?

01:46.633 --> 01:48.157
'Cause I have a balding problem!

01:48.234 --> 01:49.257
What, are you blind?

01:49.334 --> 01:50.198
Are you blind?!

01:50.267 --> 01:51.359
No, we're not blind.

01:51.434 --> 01:52.265
I had no idea.

01:52.335 --> 01:53.335
I didn't know.

01:53.402 --> 01:55.369
Anyway, I need the Princess

01:55.435 --> 01:57.527
hair so I can put it on my head.

01:57.602 --> 01:59.728
And then I'll be beautiful.

01:59.802 --> 02:02.031
Oh. Well, we know
lots of Princesses.

02:04.369 --> 02:06.836
Uh, can you, um,
give us a minute?

02:06.903 --> 02:09.097
Yeah, okay.

02:09.169 --> 02:10.966
Dude, I don't think
we should help her.

02:11.037 --> 02:11.902
Why not?

02:11.970 --> 02:13.267
'Cause she's a witch!

02:13.337 --> 02:14.964
Maybe she's a good witch.

02:15.038 --> 02:15.868
Her?

02:15.938 --> 02:16.938
Are you kidding?

02:17.004 --> 02:18.004
Come on, look at her!

02:19.338 --> 02:21.202
If she was good, she
wouldn't be so ugly.

02:21.271 --> 02:23.068
Are you guys still talking?!

02:23.139 --> 02:24.333
So what do we do?

02:24.406 --> 02:26.430
Tell her we can't help
her 'cause she's ugly?

02:26.506 --> 02:27.973
No, man, she'll kill us

02:28.040 --> 02:30.768
or put a freaky curse
on us or something.

02:30.840 --> 02:32.535
Let me get rid of her with some

02:32.607 --> 02:35.438
of my world-famous
"smoove" talking.

02:35.507 --> 02:37.974
Hey, sorry about that, girl.

02:38.041 --> 02:38.871
Ahh.

02:38.941 --> 02:40.374
You don't mind if I
take a load off,

02:40.441 --> 02:41.271
do you?

02:41.341 --> 02:42.968
What were you guys
talking about?

02:43.042 --> 02:44.099
How pretty you are.

02:44.174 --> 02:45.606
Huh?

02:45.674 --> 02:46.732
We were just saying

02:46.807 --> 02:48.083
someone as pretty as you doesn't

02:48.107 --> 02:50.007
even need a full head of hair.

02:50.074 --> 02:51.371
Isn't that right, buddy?

02:51.441 --> 02:53.238
Uh, yeah, totally.

02:53.309 --> 02:54.401
Nuh-unh.

02:55.475 --> 02:56.669
Girl, if I didn't

02:56.742 --> 02:58.073
already have a G.F., I'd be on

02:58.142 --> 03:00.803
you like butter on toast!

03:00.876 --> 03:03.139
I don't mind if you have a

03:03.210 --> 03:04.643
G.F.

03:04.710 --> 03:06.109
Oh. Um...

03:06.177 --> 03:07.803
Dude, I don't think
it's working.

03:07.877 --> 03:08.877
Yeah, I think I'm

03:08.944 --> 03:10.275
making things worse.

03:10.344 --> 03:11.174
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

03:11.244 --> 03:12.074
Hey.

03:12.144 --> 03:13.077
What?

03:13.144 --> 03:15.408
How would you... court me?

03:15.477 --> 03:17.502
Um... Spaghetti dinner?

03:17.579 --> 03:18.579
Hmm.

03:18.645 --> 03:19.805
Look, Lady, we can't

03:19.879 --> 03:21.073
help you get Princess hair.

03:21.146 --> 03:21.976
Why not?

03:22.046 --> 03:23.479
Because we only help

03:23.545 --> 03:25.035
when someone's in danger.

03:25.112 --> 03:26.010
Oh!

03:26.079 --> 03:27.944
Well, why didn't you say so?

03:30.813 --> 03:32.371
Hey, uh, what's...

03:32.447 --> 03:33.277
Yaaah!

03:33.347 --> 03:35.211
Hey!

03:35.280 --> 03:36.111
There.

03:36.181 --> 03:37.738
Now someone's in danger.

03:37.814 --> 03:39.940
I told you she was evil!

03:40.014 --> 03:41.037
Grrrrrr!

03:41.114 --> 03:42.012
Yaah!

03:42.081 --> 03:43.571
Unh! Oof!

03:43.648 --> 03:45.376
What, you forget I'm a witch?

03:45.447 --> 03:46.346
Maybe.

03:46.415 --> 03:48.575
Well, <i>maybe</i> you should get me

03:48.648 --> 03:50.774
some Princess hair so <i>maybe</i> your

03:50.849 --> 03:52.873
friend doesn't get sucked into

03:52.949 --> 03:54.745
my bottomless bottom!

03:54.815 --> 03:55.815
Nyuh!

03:55.882 --> 03:57.042
Get some Princess hair!

03:57.115 --> 03:58.343
All right, fine!

03:58.416 --> 03:59.439
Wait!

03:59.516 --> 04:01.347
Uh, you... you can't tell anyone

04:01.417 --> 04:02.417
why you need it.

04:02.483 --> 04:03.814
What? Why?

04:03.884 --> 04:05.942
I don't want anyone to know I

04:06.017 --> 04:08.348
have a balding problem.

04:08.418 --> 04:10.282
O... kay.

04:14.351 --> 04:16.148
It's Princess Muscles' Castle!

04:21.652 --> 04:22.812
Hi, Finn.

04:22.886 --> 04:23.886
Uh, hey,

04:23.953 --> 04:24.783
Princess Muscles.

04:24.853 --> 04:26.320
What brings you by?

04:26.386 --> 04:27.478
Um, you were the

04:27.553 --> 04:28.986
nearest Princess, and I need a

04:29.054 --> 04:30.214
lock of your hair.

04:30.287 --> 04:31.549
I understand.

04:31.620 --> 04:32.620
You do?

04:32.654 --> 04:34.348
Mm-hmm.

04:34.421 --> 04:35.786
Aah!

04:35.855 --> 04:36.878
What are you doing?

04:36.955 --> 04:38.320
Trying to give you a hug.

04:38.388 --> 04:39.218
Why?

04:39.288 --> 04:40.414
I want hair, not hug!

04:40.488 --> 04:41.955
Oh. I see.

04:42.021 --> 04:44.954
You want to take
things slo-o-o-w.

04:45.021 --> 04:45.851
No!

04:45.921 --> 04:47.149
I... I'm here to save you!

04:47.222 --> 04:48.052
From your hair!

04:48.121 --> 04:49.053
It looks really bad!

04:49.121 --> 04:50.349
Cut it off, quick!

04:50.422 --> 04:51.684
Of course it looks bad.

04:51.755 --> 04:53.222
If I had beautiful, shiny hair,

04:53.289 --> 04:54.687
no one would look at my muscles.

04:54.755 --> 04:55.688
Unh! Hwuh!

04:55.756 --> 04:56.882
Come back when you want to

04:56.957 --> 04:59.514
get serious about loving me!

05:00.790 --> 05:02.916
I <i>am</i> terrible at
talking to ladies.

05:04.390 --> 05:05.254
Hmm.

05:05.324 --> 05:06.951
Where's a Princess?

05:07.024 --> 05:08.024
Princess?

05:08.058 --> 05:09.081
Princess...

05:09.158 --> 05:10.181
Princess...

05:10.258 --> 05:11.258
Who's that?

05:13.059 --> 05:14.320
It's Lumpy Space Princess.

05:16.658 --> 05:19.490
Does she live in the woods now?

05:19.559 --> 05:21.423
G-g-get away from my camp.

05:21.492 --> 05:22.492
I'll cut you!

05:22.559 --> 05:24.424
Hrm.

05:24.493 --> 05:26.426
I'm never gonna go back home.

05:26.493 --> 05:27.516
Huh.

05:27.594 --> 05:30.755
Wait. Does she even have hair?

05:31.927 --> 05:34.622
She does!

05:34.695 --> 05:38.685
Well... hair is hair.

05:38.761 --> 05:39.761
Oh, my glob.

05:39.795 --> 05:41.786
What the stuff are you doing?

05:41.863 --> 05:43.420
Why are you cutting my lumps?!

05:43.495 --> 05:45.223
Because they're, uh...

05:45.295 --> 05:46.353
So...

05:46.429 --> 05:47.259
I knew you liked me.

05:47.329 --> 05:48.193
No! I don't!

05:48.262 --> 05:49.305
I-I'm just stopping
by because...

05:49.329 --> 05:50.921
Just admit it, Lover Boy!

05:50.996 --> 05:52.293
You can't resist me.

05:52.363 --> 05:53.920
Well, if you want these lumps,

05:53.996 --> 05:55.623
you got to put a ring on it!

05:55.697 --> 05:56.720
Where's my ring?!

05:56.797 --> 05:57.627
Aah!

05:57.697 --> 05:58.994
I knew you liked me, Finn.

05:59.064 --> 06:00.224
That's why you're running!

06:00.297 --> 06:02.957
Get in touch with
your feelings, babe!

06:04.564 --> 06:05.997
What am I gonna do?

06:06.065 --> 06:06.895
Huh?

06:06.965 --> 06:08.023
A graveyard?

06:08.098 --> 06:08.928
Yes!

06:08.998 --> 06:09.998
There's got to be a hairy

06:10.065 --> 06:11.191
Princess in there that won't

06:11.265 --> 06:12.265
think I'm hitting on her!

06:12.332 --> 06:13.332
Princess.

06:13.365 --> 06:14.365
Princess.

06:14.432 --> 06:15.432
Princess?

06:15.465 --> 06:17.399
Ugh! Come on!

06:17.466 --> 06:18.466
Bingo!

06:18.499 --> 06:20.693
"Here lies Princess Beautiful.

06:20.766 --> 06:22.358
She was so beautiful."

06:22.433 --> 06:24.162
Hey, that's perfect!

06:24.234 --> 06:26.997
And sort of macabre.

06:27.067 --> 06:28.227
Oh, well.

06:35.768 --> 06:38.735
Aha!

06:38.802 --> 06:39.633
Hi, Finn.

06:39.702 --> 06:41.033
Ohh!

06:41.102 --> 06:41.933
What?

06:42.003 --> 06:42.935
What are you...

06:43.003 --> 06:44.003
Please stop.

06:44.035 --> 06:45.434
Where's her hair?!

06:45.501 --> 06:46.525
Thanks, Finn.

06:47.669 --> 06:49.568
"Here lies Princess beautiful.

06:49.636 --> 06:50.728
She was so beautiful...

06:50.803 --> 06:52.667
But died of baldness"?!

06:52.736 --> 06:53.759
Dang it!

06:53.836 --> 06:56.030
I'm gonna look so beautiful.

06:56.103 --> 06:58.502
Invited to all the parties...

06:58.570 --> 07:00.594
Jake! Jake!

07:00.670 --> 07:01.670
I'm sorry, man.

07:01.737 --> 07:02.999
Getting Princess hair is...

07:03.071 --> 07:04.094
Is impossible!

07:04.171 --> 07:05.968
They all just think I'm
in love with them!

07:06.038 --> 07:07.664
Ugh! I can't do it.

07:07.738 --> 07:08.781
You're gonna have to spend the

07:08.805 --> 07:10.931
rest of your life in
this witch's butt.

07:11.005 --> 07:12.529
Noooo!

07:12.606 --> 07:13.606
Eh! Quiet down!

07:13.672 --> 07:15.401
I'm daydreaming!

07:15.473 --> 07:16.837
Dude, if they think you

07:16.906 --> 07:18.305
like them, then use that.

07:18.373 --> 07:19.396
Embrace it!

07:19.473 --> 07:21.134
Find the least terrible
Princess you can,

07:21.207 --> 07:22.730
play her some music,

07:22.807 --> 07:24.365
cook her a meal, "Smoove" talk

07:24.441 --> 07:25.930
her until she likes you.

07:26.007 --> 07:27.338
And then get the hair!

07:27.407 --> 07:29.102
Wait. You mean
like go on a date?

07:29.175 --> 07:31.233
Marry a Princess if you need to!

07:31.308 --> 07:32.707
Just get her hair!

07:32.775 --> 07:33.605
Aaaah!

07:33.675 --> 07:34.903
Jake!

07:34.976 --> 07:37.170
Go get the hair!

07:37.243 --> 07:38.505
Okay! Hold on!

07:41.076 --> 07:42.441
Princess Bubblegum!

07:42.509 --> 07:43.441
Hi, Finn!

07:43.509 --> 07:44.566
Uh...

07:44.642 --> 07:45.718
I need you to come with me!

07:45.742 --> 07:46.573
Why?

07:46.642 --> 07:48.405
I'm watering right now.

07:48.476 --> 07:49.875
Just come on.

07:49.943 --> 07:50.943
We don't have much time!

07:52.576 --> 07:53.634
What is this, Finn?

07:53.710 --> 07:55.302
We're gonna have a
spaghetti dinner.

07:55.377 --> 07:56.207
Whoa! Really?

07:56.277 --> 07:57.209
Where do we sit?

07:57.277 --> 08:01.234
Dyaaaaaaah!

08:04.612 --> 08:05.635
Um, Finn?

08:07.312 --> 08:08.710
Put your butt here! Hurry!

08:08.778 --> 08:15.804
Oh.

08:15.880 --> 08:18.609
Hey, Simon, make it romantic.

08:21.313 --> 08:22.439
Ow!

08:22.513 --> 08:23.344
Here, shove this in your mouth!

08:23.414 --> 08:24.244
It's hot!

08:24.314 --> 08:25.838
Finn, I don't understa...

08:25.914 --> 08:26.973
Please, Princess!

08:27.047 --> 08:28.207
Just stick it in your mouth!

08:28.281 --> 08:30.272
Well, okay.

08:31.582 --> 08:34.048
You're lucky I love spaghetti!

08:34.115 --> 08:35.878
Um, Princess...

08:35.948 --> 08:36.881
Do you like me?

08:36.948 --> 08:39.381
Finn, of course I like you.

08:39.450 --> 08:41.246
Really?

08:41.316 --> 08:42.681
Yeah!

08:42.750 --> 08:44.148
Yes! Now give me
some of your hair!

08:45.883 --> 08:48.180
Oh, Finn, that's sweet.

08:48.250 --> 08:50.945
Sure, I'll give you
some of my hair.

08:51.017 --> 08:53.007
Here. Take it, you cutie.

08:53.984 --> 08:56.713
Thank you, Princess Bubblegum!

08:56.784 --> 08:58.149
My spaghetti!

08:58.217 --> 09:00.310
My cat had kittens, and I'm

09:00.385 --> 09:02.851
thinking of naming
one "Little Whiner."

09:02.918 --> 09:03.817
What do you think?

09:03.886 --> 09:05.785
Is that a good name?

09:06.285 --> 09:08.219
Totally did it!

09:08.286 --> 09:09.480
Genuine Princess hair.

09:09.553 --> 09:10.679
You hear that, Jake?

09:10.753 --> 09:13.084
Just give it to her already!

09:13.153 --> 09:15.382
All right, Lady, a
deal is a deal.

09:15.454 --> 09:17.886
Ahh!

09:17.953 --> 09:20.182
This isn't hair!

09:20.254 --> 09:21.414
It's Bubblegum!

09:21.487 --> 09:23.421
What?!

09:23.488 --> 09:25.216
It <i>is Bubblegum!</i>

09:25.288 --> 09:26.721
Well, I guess you failed.

09:26.788 --> 09:28.652
Say goodbye to your dog.

09:28.722 --> 09:30.383
Aaaah!

09:30.456 --> 09:31.479
Wait!

09:33.723 --> 09:34.553
What?

09:34.623 --> 09:35.851
If I learned anything today,

09:35.923 --> 09:37.220
it's that I'm awesome at

09:37.290 --> 09:38.518
talking to ladies!

09:38.589 --> 09:41.284
And, Lady, you are crazy ugly!

09:41.357 --> 09:42.187
Wha-a-a-t?

09:42.257 --> 09:43.257
Dude!

09:43.323 --> 09:44.550
Having beautiful hair

09:44.623 --> 09:46.454
isn't gonna get you anywhere,

09:46.523 --> 09:49.581
because you're ugly,
inside and out...

09:49.657 --> 09:53.182
So ugly I want to throw up.

09:53.258 --> 09:54.452
Dude!

09:54.524 --> 09:56.047
No one will ever find

09:56.124 --> 09:58.853
you beautiful, <i>ever!</i>

09:58.925 --> 10:00.619
And it's got nothing to do with

10:00.691 --> 10:01.851
the ol' chrome dome.

10:01.925 --> 10:04.358
It has to do with
what's in here.

10:04.425 --> 10:05.858
Can you get off my friend now?

10:05.926 --> 10:08.155
D-u-u-ude.

10:08.226 --> 10:09.954
- He's right.
- Huh?

10:10.026 --> 10:11.459
Well, don't get me wrong.

10:11.526 --> 10:12.526
I know I'm ugly.

10:12.560 --> 10:13.788
And evil.

10:15.361 --> 10:17.055
But I thought if I had
some beautiful hair,

10:17.127 --> 10:19.060
I could learn

10:19.127 --> 10:21.924
how to love myself.

10:21.995 --> 10:22.995
Gee.

10:23.028 --> 10:24.393
I feel kind of bad.

10:24.462 --> 10:25.554
I don't.

10:25.629 --> 10:26.561
Hey, witch!

10:26.629 --> 10:28.119
Does it have to
be Princess hair?

10:28.196 --> 10:30.628
No. Just beautiful hair.

10:30.695 --> 10:33.527
Well, then, check this out!

10:39.130 --> 10:41.154
Ha ha-a-a-a-a-a!

10:43.730 --> 10:45.890
You'd really give me your hair?

10:45.963 --> 10:48.863
Sure!

10:48.931 --> 10:51.329
So... how do I look?

10:51.397 --> 10:52.728
Totally beautiful,

10:52.797 --> 10:54.662
inside and out!

10:54.732 --> 10:55.959
Thank you, Finn.

10:56.031 --> 10:58.464
And now to use my hair for evil.

10:58.531 --> 10:59.362
What?!

10:59.431 --> 11:00.523
'Cause I'm evil!

11:01.633 --> 11:03.327
What did you want from me?

11:03.399 --> 11:04.229
Ohh...

11:04.299 --> 11:06.028
Oh, no.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.226
I think I fractured a branch.
