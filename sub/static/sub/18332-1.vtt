00:14.000 --> 00:16.100
Far in the dim past. . .

00:16.200 --> 00:20.100
when myth and history
merged into mystery

00:20.000 --> 00:24.400
and the gods of fable
and the primitive beliefs of man

00:24.300 --> 00:26.600
dwelt on ancient
Mount Olympus,

00:26.700 --> 00:28.600
in antique Greece

00:28.700 --> 00:33.000
a legendary hero walked
godlike upon the earth. . .

00:33.000 --> 00:34.700
sometimes.

00:34.900 --> 00:36.500
Man: Why can't I go?

00:36.600 --> 00:38.800
Because your place
is here with the rest of us.

00:38.800 --> 00:41.300
- You let Mars travel.
- That's his job.

00:41.300 --> 00:44.800
Until mankind learns to dispense
with his services

00:44.700 --> 00:48.300
and lives in peace,
Mars must go where he's called.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.600
I only want
to browse around.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.100
You'd only get into trouble.

00:53.100 --> 00:55.200
I have been here
thousands of years.

00:55.300 --> 00:58.400
- I am bored.
- Don't interrupt your father!

00:59.700 --> 01:01.300
Besides. . .

01:01.300 --> 01:03.800
these mortals are
bedeviled by

01:03.900 --> 01:05.900
as aggravating a collection
of annoyances

01:05.900 --> 01:09.000
as it is possible for one
to imagine.

01:09.100 --> 01:11.900
It may not be entirely
without merit,

01:11.900 --> 01:15.000
- but you wouldn't like it there.
- Let me be the judge of that.

01:14.900 --> 01:19.300
I am tired of the same old faces,
the same old things.

01:19.300 --> 01:22.000
Tired or not,
you're staying here!

03:24.500 --> 03:27.000
Woman: Zeus, I beg of you,

03:27.100 --> 03:29.500
Hercules is only hotheaded.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.300
He does not mean to oppose
your wishes.

03:32.300 --> 03:34.200
Mind your own business,
Venus.

03:34.200 --> 03:35.900
He has grown insufferable.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.500
I will not be bearded to my face
by this insolent young whelp.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.100
He's only a demigod.

03:41.200 --> 03:44.300
He gives himself airs
his mortal birth does not warrant.

03:44.300 --> 03:47.700
My mother may have been a mortal,
but you, Zeus, my father,

03:47.800 --> 03:49.300
are a god.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.500
I will discuss this
no further.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.600
Does this mean I have
Zeus' permission to leave?

03:53.600 --> 03:55.500
It means you will stay.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.900
I don't wish to hear
another word on the subject.

03:57.900 --> 03:59.500
I won't stay.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.800
You are trying my patience,
Hercules.

04:01.800 --> 04:04.500
- You are trying mine.
- Heed my words!

04:06.900 --> 04:08.700
Nobody will stop me.

04:08.700 --> 04:11.200
How dare you address
such remarks to your father!

04:11.300 --> 04:12.700
It's easy.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.700
Why you offensive puppy!

04:16.700 --> 04:19.500
Perhaps this will teach you
respect for your elders!

04:22.100 --> 04:24.300
Venus: Zeus,
Hercules is half mortal.

04:24.300 --> 04:27.300
- He may be killed.
- He's only a spoiled youth.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.400
Save him.

04:28.400 --> 04:31.200
Hercules is your son.
Forgive him!

04:33.300 --> 04:36.400
If I had known how much trouble
it would cause me,

04:36.500 --> 04:40.800
I'd have thought twice when I met
his mother on vacation.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.000
Aahh!

04:55.400 --> 04:59.100
- Tell me what's wrong.
- I just saw a man.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.200
Yes, my dear, that's not unusual.
There are men on this airplane.

05:03.300 --> 05:05.600
No, outside!

05:05.700 --> 05:08.400
- He was flying.
- Outside?

05:08.300 --> 05:10.400
Yes, he just passed my window.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.700
Stewardess!

05:12.800 --> 05:14.500
And he was. . .
he was naked!

05:14.700 --> 05:17.600
And he was just going down,
flying.

05:17.600 --> 05:20.200
- And he. . .
- We're traveling at 30,000 feet.

05:20.300 --> 05:22.300
No man,
nude or otherwise,

05:22.400 --> 05:24.800
could possibly be flying
outside a jet plane.

05:24.900 --> 05:26.700
Oh, he was very handsome.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.600
And he had big muscles.

05:28.600 --> 05:30.600
And he was practically naked.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.500
Oh, dear.
Oh, my.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.900
I shouldn't have taken Agatha
to see all those Greek statues.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.200
She's so impressionable.

05:40.900 --> 05:43.400
We throw ourselves
at Zeus' feet.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.000
Woman: Get up,
you stupid creatures.

05:45.100 --> 05:48.800
Let Hercules suffer the consequences
of his own obstinacy.

05:48.700 --> 05:52.900
J uno has hated Hercules
ever since the day of his birth.

05:52.900 --> 05:55.400
All right! Do not be
disrespectful to my wife.

05:57.100 --> 05:59.200
Let us see what
he is doing now.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.600
( claps hands )

06:03.300 --> 06:06.100
He's in the sea now.
He will drown!

06:06.100 --> 06:07.700
Save him, Great Zeus.

06:07.700 --> 06:10.000
It will take more than Neptune
or any of his creatures

06:10.100 --> 06:12.700
- to overcome a son of Zeus.
- Save him, Zeus!

06:12.800 --> 06:14.100
Save Hercules!

06:14.100 --> 06:15.900
All right, all right.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.800
I have done so.

06:18.900 --> 06:22.400
Behold, coming over
the horizon of the sea.

06:27.700 --> 06:30.000
( ship's horn blows )

06:33.800 --> 06:36.000
What were you doing
out in the water?

06:36.000 --> 06:38.800
- Swimming.
- A hundred miles from land?

06:38.800 --> 06:40.700
I fell.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.500
- Fell?
- Yes.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.000
How did that happen?

06:44.000 --> 06:46.700
- There was an explosion.
- Oh?

06:46.700 --> 06:48.400
- What ship?
- Ship?

06:48.500 --> 06:50.000
From which you
were blown overboard.

06:50.100 --> 06:51.400
Olympus.

06:51.400 --> 06:54.200
There's a Greek freighter
by that name.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.400
- What's your name?
- Hercules.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.800
- Greek, huh?
- Very old family.

07:00.800 --> 07:01.800
Sir?

07:01.900 --> 07:03.500
It's all right,
I'm democratic.

07:03.600 --> 07:06.400
You're addressing the captain
of this ship. Say ''sir'' to me.

07:06.500 --> 07:08.400
- I am Hercules.
- So you told me.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.200
No man is superior
to Hercules.

07:10.300 --> 07:11.900
Begging the captain's
pardon,

07:11.900 --> 07:15.700
but an immersion in the water
can put a man off his head.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.200
H uh.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.700
- What's your berth?
- I am the son of Zeus.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.300
I'm referring to your rating,
not your family tree.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.700
What's your rating
when you ship out to sea?

07:28.900 --> 07:30.800
What's your second name?
Hercules what?

07:30.800 --> 07:34.200
As I have told you,
I am Hercules, son of Zeus.

07:34.300 --> 07:36.700
I don't think he means
any disrespect.

07:36.700 --> 07:38.700
He probably loses it
in the translation.

07:38.700 --> 07:40.600
All right, sign him on
as Hercules Zeus,

07:40.600 --> 07:43.500
since that's his father name,
and get him an O.S. rating.

07:43.600 --> 07:44.900
Aye, aye, sir.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Get him what clothes
you can that might fit him.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.500
Come with me.

07:55.700 --> 07:58.400
- Where's this ship bound for?
- New York.

08:10.600 --> 08:11.600
Carstairs!

08:26.500 --> 08:28.500
Carstairs!

08:28.600 --> 08:30.800
Stop that fight!

08:38.900 --> 08:41.600
Okay, I'm with you, boy.
Better forget it.

08:41.700 --> 08:45.100
Oh no, you don't. No, no.
I'm your friend.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.900
Bosun,
what's the meaning of this?

08:50.800 --> 08:52.700
Well, he refused to work, sir.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.200
And when I tried
to persuade him, well, he. . .

08:56.600 --> 08:58.800
He's a foreigner.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.000
Perhaps he didn't
understand you.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.600
I understood him.

09:02.700 --> 09:04.900
He's most disagreeable
and he has irritated me.

09:37.300 --> 09:39.400
- Where do you think you're going?
- Ashore.

09:39.500 --> 09:42.700
- The captain give you permission?
- Hercules goes where he wishes.

09:42.700 --> 09:45.000
Not on this ship, you don't.
Get your carcass below.

09:45.100 --> 09:46.400
Get yours!

09:52.100 --> 09:54.000
Yo, Hercules!
Come back here!

09:57.600 --> 09:58.900
Stop him!
Somebody grab him!

09:59.100 --> 10:00.300
Get him!

10:00.300 --> 10:01.500
Alex!

10:04.600 --> 10:06.500
Hey, you guys!

10:06.500 --> 10:08.300
20 bucks for the first man
that flattens him.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.700
Man: Come on! Come on!

10:35.100 --> 10:35.900
Oooh!

10:41.600 --> 10:43.600
Come on, push him.
That's it.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.500
Come on!

11:08.400 --> 11:10.000
Come on, push it!

11:26.300 --> 11:28.000
Come on, let's get him!

11:42.900 --> 11:44.900
You'd better get out of here.
They're gonna kill you!

11:45.000 --> 11:47.500
Come on,
we'll get a cab.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.600
Here!

11:52.600 --> 11:54.000
Go ahead!

12:05.600 --> 12:07.800
What's the matter with you?!
Let go!

12:12.800 --> 12:16.000
Fine chariot,
but where are the horses?

12:15.900 --> 12:17.700
Let go of that!
What's the matter?

12:17.800 --> 12:19.700
Hey, let go of that!

12:43.300 --> 12:44.800
Where to?

12:44.900 --> 12:47.000
Uptown.
And step on it!

12:49.700 --> 12:51.300
Boy, that was close.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.300
What was close?

12:53.300 --> 12:55.400
They almost nailed you!

12:55.400 --> 12:57.200
What did you do?
J ump ship?

12:57.300 --> 12:59.400
No, I walked off.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.200
You walked off.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.100
- What's your name?
- Hercules.

13:03.100 --> 13:05.200
Oh. Mine is Pretzi.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.500
They call me Pretzi,
because, you see,

13:07.500 --> 13:09.900
I sell pretzels
on the waterfront.

13:10.900 --> 13:12.800
- Where you from?
- Greece.

13:12.800 --> 13:15.200
Oh! I used to know
a Greek guy.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.900
He ran a beanery
down in the Village.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.900
His name was Apollo.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.200
I never found out
what his second name was.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.400
- I know Apollo.
- You do?

13:24.500 --> 13:28.900
Well, is this a small world?
You know Apollo. Gee.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.600
I wonder where Apollo is now.

13:30.700 --> 13:32.800
I haven't seen him
in two or three years.

13:32.800 --> 13:35.000
- He's back home.
- He went home, huh?

13:35.100 --> 13:38.500
He was all the time talking about
how homesick he was.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.500
So he finally went home.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.300
He was a real nice guy.

13:42.400 --> 13:46.200
Conceited. He thinks there's
nobody handsomer in the world.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.900
Handsome? Apollo?

13:48.000 --> 13:51.300
You must be kidding.
Come on, say you're kidding.

13:51.300 --> 13:54.900
Handsome? With that big black
wart on his nose?

13:55.000 --> 13:57.500
And those
little beady crossed eyes?

13:57.500 --> 13:58.500
( laughing )

13:58.600 --> 14:00.600
He must have been in disguise.

14:00.700 --> 14:03.100
I wonder if Apollo
ever got married.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.900
He was all the time
looking for a wife.

14:05.900 --> 14:09.000
Maybe that's why he went home,
to find a wife.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.200
Diana and Terpsichore
are in love with him.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.600
I think Hebe is attracted, too.

14:14.700 --> 14:16.200
No kidding.

14:16.300 --> 14:18.900
It shows you how desperate
some women could be.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.900
That is really amazing.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
You hungry?
Wait a minute.

14:23.100 --> 14:24.600
Here, here.

14:24.700 --> 14:26.100
Go ahead, help yourself.

14:26.100 --> 14:29.000
- I'm grateful.
- Think nothing of it.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.400
Good, huh?

14:32.600 --> 14:34.400
Food for the gods.

14:34.400 --> 14:37.200
Well, I get them
from a bakery in Brooklyn

14:37.200 --> 14:39.200
called
''Food For the Gods Bakery.''

14:40.100 --> 14:41.800
Where you guys wanna go?

14:44.100 --> 14:47.200
Hey, what do you know?
Central Park.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.900
This is good enough.

14:49.100 --> 14:51.000
It's fine.

14:58.100 --> 15:00.300
Here we are
in Central Park.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.900
I'll go get my bag.

15:03.100 --> 15:05.900
- That'll be two bucks.
- Big city, New York.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.000
Bigger than Athens.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.600
Bigger than Rome.

15:11.700 --> 15:13.200
Bigger than Carthage.

15:13.300 --> 15:15.300
I'd say New York is the biggest
place there is.

15:15.300 --> 15:17.600
- Pay the cabbie.
- Pay him?

15:17.700 --> 15:20.900
- What?
- For the ride, two bucks.

15:20.900 --> 15:23.000
Bucks?

15:23.000 --> 15:25.400
The bread, the shekels,

15:25.400 --> 15:27.900
you know, the long green,
the money, two bucks!

15:27.900 --> 15:31.000
He wants to be paid for driving
Hercules in the chariot?

15:31.100 --> 15:32.600
That's the idea, mack.

15:32.700 --> 15:34.400
My name is Hercules.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.000
Hercules, Schmurcules,
give me the dough.

15:38.200 --> 15:42.400
Bucks? Doe? What's all this talk
about male and female animals?

15:44.000 --> 15:45.800
This guy got all his marbles?

15:45.900 --> 15:48.100
He's just come over
from the old country.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.600
Look, Herc, it's money.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.500
You know, drachmas.

15:51.500 --> 15:52.900
Money?

15:52.900 --> 15:55.200
I don't have any money.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.700
You don't have any money?

15:57.700 --> 15:59.900
Holy moley.
He ain't got no money.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.600
Hercules doesn't need
any money.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.100
What?

16:04.100 --> 16:07.000
That's the stupidest thing
I've heard in my whole life.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.100
A couple of deadbeats, huh?

16:09.100 --> 16:11.100
Pretzi: Look, buddy,
you see. . .

16:11.100 --> 16:13.000
There's been a little mistake.

16:13.100 --> 16:16.100
Well, now,
ain't that something.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.600
A mistake.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.800
Well, what do you know. . .

16:19.900 --> 16:21.300
a mistake.

16:21.400 --> 16:23.700
Last time, you gonna give up
the dough or ain't you?

16:23.800 --> 16:26.700
Isn't it enough since Hercules
rode in your chariot?

16:26.700 --> 16:28.300
You've been immortalized.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.100
I've been who?

16:30.100 --> 16:32.400
You heard him,
you've been immortalized.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.900
- Driver: Are you nuts?
- Well, you see. . .

16:35.000 --> 16:37.900
- It's like this--
- Driver: Like what?

16:37.900 --> 16:39.900
Well, you see. . .
uh, we, I--

16:40.000 --> 16:41.900
Okay, call the cops.

16:41.900 --> 16:44.700
Not before I have some fun
by taking it out of your hides.

16:44.700 --> 16:46.900
- Run, Herc!
- You deadbeat!

16:46.900 --> 16:49.400
How dare you
touch Hercules?!

18:02.000 --> 18:05.900
Brad says we've got the best
all around team we've ever had,

18:05.800 --> 18:08.400
a cinch to win first place
in the intercollegiate meet.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.200
I should hope so.

18:10.300 --> 18:12.800
I know Rod, for one,
has worked very hard,

18:12.900 --> 18:15.600
even to the point
of neglecting you, I'm afraid.

18:15.600 --> 18:18.500
I don't mind, Dad.
I want him to succeed.

18:18.500 --> 18:20.500
I'm sure he will,
darling.

18:20.600 --> 18:24.000
You know what pleases me most,
Helen, about these boys?

18:24.000 --> 18:27.500
J udging from their classroom work,
they apparently have brains

18:27.400 --> 18:28.700
as well as brawn.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.300
How are those men
over there?

18:41.400 --> 18:43.300
They're just athletes
training.

18:43.300 --> 18:45.200
- Athletes?
- College guys.

18:45.300 --> 18:46.200
Hmmph. . .

18:46.400 --> 18:48.600
What do you mean?
You think you could do better?

18:48.700 --> 18:49.500
( snorts )

18:49.700 --> 18:52.800
What do you mean?
These guys happen to be champions.

18:52.800 --> 18:53.800
Ha!

18:54.000 --> 18:56.200
- Nobody can beat them.
- Ha!

18:56.200 --> 18:58.100
Wait!
Where are you going?

18:58.200 --> 19:00.000
- Over there.
- What for?

19:00.100 --> 19:02.100
To show them how
to throw the discus.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.900
No, no.
You've gotta stay here.

19:04.900 --> 19:06.700
You can't go
buttin' in there.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.600
They would not like me
to instruct them?

19:08.700 --> 19:11.400
No, it's just for college guys.
No outsiders allowed.

19:11.500 --> 19:13.000
I am Hercules.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.400
Put that discus down!
You have no business out here.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.600
Those men do not throw it
far enough.

19:24.700 --> 19:26.700
- You don't say.
- I do say.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.300
- What is it, Helen?
- That man with the discus,

19:31.400 --> 19:33.500
the coach seems to be
arguing with him.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.400
These boys are
record holders.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.600
Then they should
be better.

19:37.700 --> 19:40.100
I suppose you believe
that you're better.

19:40.100 --> 19:43.600
I once showed them in the
Olympics in Greece how to do it.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.500
They profited by
my instruction.

19:45.700 --> 19:49.200
You showed us in
the Greek Olympics, huh?

19:49.200 --> 19:52.200
- What year was that?
- That was the year. . .

19:52.200 --> 19:54.900
Hey, coach.
Let him show us, coach.

19:54.900 --> 19:57.200
Maybe there is something
we could learn.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.600
Well,
it's always possible.

19:59.700 --> 20:02.100
All right, go ahead.
Show us.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.000
Thank you.

20:32.700 --> 20:34.500
What else do you do?

20:34.600 --> 20:36.100
I ncredible.

20:38.300 --> 20:39.600
Okay, Tom.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.300
( cheers and applause )

20:45.600 --> 20:48.600
Great throw, Tom!
Great throw!

20:48.700 --> 20:50.800
Okay, let's see you
beat that.

20:50.900 --> 20:53.200
A very good throw
for the earthbound.

20:53.200 --> 20:56.700
Skip the wisecracks.
Put your money where your mouth is.

20:56.600 --> 20:58.400
I do not have any money.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.700
I mean, stop talking. . .

21:03.700 --> 21:05.300
demonstrate.

21:05.300 --> 21:06.400
All right.

21:42.300 --> 21:43.700
Wow.

21:45.500 --> 21:46.700
That's my buddy.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.700
He's a Greek fella.

21:49.700 --> 21:52.300
He just come over. . .
from Greece.

21:53.500 --> 21:55.500
- Dawson.
- Coach.

21:55.500 --> 21:57.700
You're our anchorman here.

21:57.800 --> 22:00.700
- Show this fella something.
- Yes, sir, coach.

22:01.500 --> 22:04.900
Fifty bucks says my pal beats
that guy about to jump now.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.100
I'll take that.
It's a bet.

22:07.100 --> 22:09.600
- This fella can hold the money.
- No, that's all right.

22:09.700 --> 22:11.700
I trust ya, buddy.

22:17.500 --> 22:20.500
All right, Mister.
Let's see you top that.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.800
Certainly,
if you wish me to.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.800
Wish you?
Brother, I'm begging you.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.500
- I beg your pardon?
- Why, what's the matter?

22:56.500 --> 22:59.400
- Did I do something wrong?
- My name is Professor Camden.

22:59.400 --> 23:02.500
- How do you do?
- And this is my daughter, Helen.

23:02.400 --> 23:04.700
Here's our card.

23:04.700 --> 23:06.300
I wonder if you'd
do me a favor.

23:06.500 --> 23:07.800
Sure, spill it.

23:07.800 --> 23:09.200
Have tea
with my daughter and me.

23:09.300 --> 23:11.100
Shh! Not so loud!

23:11.200 --> 23:14.500
You never know when one of them
narcotics cops is around.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.700
Tea, the conventional
social drink.

23:16.700 --> 23:18.400
You mean the drinking stuff?

23:18.400 --> 23:20.400
Of course! What else?

23:20.500 --> 23:21.600
Wait a minute.

23:21.600 --> 23:24.500
You want to get together
just to drink tea?

23:24.500 --> 23:27.200
Do you find that
so uncommon?

23:27.300 --> 23:29.100
Well, no, but eh. . .

23:29.200 --> 23:33.000
it's just that nobody's ever invited
me to do that with them before.

23:32.900 --> 23:34.700
Well, around 4:00, then.

23:34.700 --> 23:36.100
Hm?

23:36.300 --> 23:37.200
Great.

23:37.300 --> 23:39.200
And bring your friend along.

23:42.700 --> 23:43.900
Hey, Herc!

23:44.500 --> 23:46.100
( doorbell rings )

23:53.400 --> 23:55.000
Please go into the library.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.000
I'll tell the professor
you're here.

24:28.400 --> 24:31.500
Hercules: Ha, ha.
Pan.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.400
It's a funny one.

24:34.500 --> 24:36.400
I must tell him about this.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.900
Yeah, you must do that.
Yeah.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.400
Helen: Hello!

24:44.700 --> 24:47.000
How do you do?
How do you do?

24:47.100 --> 24:49.000
I'm so happy you both
could be here.

24:52.600 --> 24:55.100
Hey, cut that out!

24:55.100 --> 24:57.000
- Won't you be seated?
- Thank you.

24:58.100 --> 25:00.000
My father should be here
any minute.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.700
- Is anything wrong?
- What could be wrong?

25:08.800 --> 25:11.800
It's just that you're looking
at me so strangely

25:11.900 --> 25:14.400
I feel my hair may be out of place
or something of the sort.

25:14.500 --> 25:16.400
Everything's perfect.

25:16.500 --> 25:18.200
Everything's in its place.

25:18.300 --> 25:21.200
- You remind me of someone.
- Really? Someone you know?

25:21.300 --> 25:23.300
- A goddess.
- A goddess?

25:24.300 --> 25:26.400
I remind you of a goddess?

25:26.500 --> 25:28.300
It's a beautiful day,
isn't it?

25:28.300 --> 25:30.900
If the sun comes out,
it will be a beautiful day.

25:31.800 --> 25:34.500
You and she do have
a lot in common.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.300
It's kind of you to be
so complimentary, but. . .

25:37.400 --> 25:40.800
I must say it's the first time
anyone's been quite so. . .

25:40.800 --> 25:44.100
so extravagant with his comparisons
where I'm concerned.

25:44.100 --> 25:45.000
( doorbell rings )

25:45.100 --> 25:47.400
Excuse me,
that must be my other guest.

25:48.900 --> 25:50.900
What's the matter with you?

25:50.900 --> 25:53.800
Now you cut that out!
Talking that way to that dame.

25:53.900 --> 25:57.700
You're acting like some kind
of a bull in a ten-cent store.

25:57.600 --> 25:59.900
You just got here,
and right away you're on the make.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.900
- What am I making?
- J ust cut it out.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.800
That's no way to talk
to a dame.

26:03.900 --> 26:05.700
I don't understand.

26:07.100 --> 26:09.200
Maybe I'm being
a little rough on you.

26:09.300 --> 26:11.300
Maybe you do things differently
where you come from,

26:11.400 --> 26:15.100
but that's not the way we talk
to a dame here, that's all.

26:15.100 --> 26:17.200
What did I say
that was wrong?

26:17.300 --> 26:19.000
J ust cut it out!
That's all!

26:19.100 --> 26:21.500
That's not the way to talk
to a broad, understand?

26:21.500 --> 26:23.500
I guess you all
know each other.

26:23.600 --> 26:25.600
- Hi, fellas.
- How do you do?

26:25.600 --> 26:27.000
How are you doing?

26:27.200 --> 26:29.000
- Hey, what's happening?
- Is he your lover?

26:29.000 --> 26:30.600
My what?

26:30.600 --> 26:32.500
Hey, Mister,
watch your talk!

26:32.600 --> 26:34.600
I can hear my talk.
I cannot watch it.

26:34.600 --> 26:37.800
You won't hear it much longer
if you don't apologize to her.

26:37.900 --> 26:40.700
Apologize for paying
her a tribute?

26:40.800 --> 26:42.000
A tribute?

26:42.100 --> 26:44.600
- I nsulting her.
- A beautiful woman

26:44.600 --> 26:47.500
with a handsome man for a friend,
they must be lovers.

26:47.500 --> 26:48.700
Herc, you cool it!

26:48.700 --> 26:51.100
I find it unnatural
if they're not.

26:51.200 --> 26:52.700
All right,
you asked for it!

26:53.200 --> 26:54.200
( thud )

26:57.500 --> 26:58.800
Ughh!

26:58.800 --> 27:00.900
You have struck Hercules.

27:00.900 --> 27:04.200
Come off that rap. Keep that up,
and you'll have to be taken away.

27:04.300 --> 27:06.100
What kind of chicken fat
you got in your head?

27:06.200 --> 27:07.000
I am Hercules.

27:07.100 --> 27:10.100
You're Hercules, I'm Rod Nelson.
Now what? Outside?

27:10.100 --> 27:12.800
I can do it just as well
in here.

27:12.800 --> 27:15.100
No, no.
You. . . you put him down!

27:15.200 --> 27:17.700
- Helen: Really, you're crazy!
- Herc!

27:17.800 --> 27:19.100
Will you put him down!

27:19.100 --> 27:21.900
Please, Mr. Hercules.
Please put him down.

27:21.900 --> 27:23.900
His first name is Hercules.

27:23.900 --> 27:26.900
His last name is Zeus.
It rhymes with ''booze.''

27:26.900 --> 27:31.300
I don't care what his name is.
Tell him to put Mr. Nelson down.

27:31.200 --> 27:33.400
Herc, you heard
what the lady said.

27:33.400 --> 27:35.500
Put the guy down.
What's the matter with you?

27:35.600 --> 27:37.500
Pretzi: Put him down
on his feet!

27:37.500 --> 27:39.400
Put him down!
Turn him loose!

27:39.500 --> 27:41.100
Helen: Put him down!

27:41.100 --> 27:43.800
- Put him down!
- Tea is served.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.900
Well, I knew it.

27:45.900 --> 27:48.700
Doesn't surprise me a bit.

27:48.800 --> 27:51.000
Wherever he goes--
trouble.

27:52.300 --> 27:55.200
What am I gonna do
with the young fool?

27:55.200 --> 27:56.800
( sniffles )

27:58.500 --> 28:01.300
Amusing situation with that fellow,
Hercules, wasn't it?

28:02.500 --> 28:05.000
Amusing?
That man must be crazy!

28:05.100 --> 28:06.900
- Original.
- Primitive.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
- I find him refreshing.
- You must be kidding!

28:10.000 --> 28:11.100
No.

28:11.200 --> 28:14.400
He almost killed Rod Nelson.
He had to have some ribs taped.

28:14.500 --> 28:17.000
Nevertheless,
Mr. Zeus interests me.

28:17.100 --> 28:19.800
I'd like to get to know him better.
Study him more closely.

28:19.800 --> 28:22.100
- Oh, really?
- Absolutely.

28:22.200 --> 28:25.700
He had the effrontery to ask if
I'd have dinner with him tonight.

28:25.800 --> 28:27.600
Well, of course you told him. . .

28:27.600 --> 28:29.900
- I would.
- Naturally.

28:33.800 --> 28:35.500
( animal growls and screeches )

28:45.400 --> 28:47.100
( growling )

28:54.200 --> 28:57.000
Oh, it was a
wonderful evening.

28:56.900 --> 29:00.100
- Thank you so much
- I enjoyed it, too.

29:00.100 --> 29:01.900
Are you homesick?

29:01.900 --> 29:04.200
I'm having too much fun.

29:04.900 --> 29:06.700
( hooves clipping )

29:13.600 --> 29:16.500
( gorilla panting )

29:37.400 --> 29:39.700
What's it like back there,
where you come from?

29:39.700 --> 29:41.100
Didn't you tell me Athens?

29:41.200 --> 29:43.500
A seaport?

29:43.500 --> 29:46.500
- We have a fine ocean view.
- Oh, that's nice.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.600
Have any brothers
and sisters there?

29:48.600 --> 29:51.200
Lots, half brothers
and half sisters.

29:51.300 --> 29:54.400
What does your father do?
What business is he in?

29:54.500 --> 29:57.300
Ha! He's a deity.

29:57.300 --> 30:00.300
I suppose he must miss you.

30:00.200 --> 30:02.500
He didn't want
to see me leave.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.700
I n fact, he was most upset.

30:04.800 --> 30:06.000
Of course.

30:06.100 --> 30:08.800
But a young man must see
the world, so they say.

30:08.900 --> 30:10.700
This is what I told him.

30:11.700 --> 30:13.600
Do you have a girl
back home?

30:15.100 --> 30:17.300
You know how it is.

30:17.300 --> 30:18.900
No, I don't.
( giggling )

30:20.600 --> 30:24.000
Radio: All Central Park units.
All Central Park units.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.500
Escaped from zoo,
one 600 lb. grizzly bear.

30:27.600 --> 30:31.200
Take caution with animal,
known to be surly and dangerous.

30:32.300 --> 30:34.100
( sirens wailing )

30:39.600 --> 30:41.300
( growling )

30:46.100 --> 30:47.400
( sirens approaching )

30:48.800 --> 30:52.100
I would really like
to see Greece one day.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.200
I've heard
it's a beautiful country.

30:54.300 --> 30:56.500
Perhaps you will
see it one day.

30:56.600 --> 30:58.200
Will you
show me around?

30:58.300 --> 31:00.500
You like
to climb mountains?

31:00.600 --> 31:02.400
Well,
I've never done any, um. . .

31:03.600 --> 31:06.000
Have you ever been
on Mt. Olympus?

31:06.100 --> 31:08.300
- I know it very well.
- No kidding!

31:08.400 --> 31:10.000
I'm not kidding.

31:10.100 --> 31:12.900
When I was a little girl,
I used to read all about it,

31:13.000 --> 31:15.900
and the gods and goddesses who
were supposed to live on top of it,

31:15.900 --> 31:17.400
and I believed it!

31:17.500 --> 31:19.900
It's one of the joys
of being really young.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.500
( growling )

31:37.300 --> 31:38.400
( Helen screaming )

31:39.800 --> 31:40.700
Ooh!

31:41.100 --> 31:42.600
( whinnying )

31:44.300 --> 31:45.800
Ooh!
Aaahh!

31:48.100 --> 31:49.400
( Helen screaming )

31:50.400 --> 31:51.600
Hercules!

31:52.700 --> 31:54.100
Beat him up!

32:04.200 --> 32:05.400
Aaahh!

32:05.600 --> 32:07.300
Oh, Hercules!

32:11.300 --> 32:12.600
Ooh!

32:13.900 --> 32:15.700
Well, beat him!

32:52.400 --> 32:55.800
- Wrestling?
- We gotta get money somehow.

32:55.700 --> 32:59.000
Using our muscles is one
of the few ways I could think of

32:59.000 --> 33:00.800
for us to get some dough.

33:00.800 --> 33:04.100
U nless you've got a better idea
on how we're gonna pay the bills

33:04.200 --> 33:06.300
that you've been running up
here at the hotel?

33:06.400 --> 33:08.200
Yes, sir, gents. . .

33:08.200 --> 33:11.600
the wrassling game is. . .
lucrative.

33:12.600 --> 33:15.700
Mr. Dugan promotes the wrestling
matches at the Armory.

33:15.700 --> 33:16.600
Right.

33:16.600 --> 33:19.100
- He saw your picture in the paper.
- Right.

33:19.200 --> 33:22.200
He read about what you'd done
to that bear.

33:22.200 --> 33:36.300
And he brought us a proposition.

33:36.400 --> 33:38.600
I'm your new partner.

33:38.700 --> 33:41.200
I saw your boy Hercules
wrestle last night.

33:41.200 --> 33:43.100
and he's gonna go places.

33:43.100 --> 33:44.100
Yeah.

33:44.200 --> 33:46.900
Dugan tells me
you're easy to deal with.

33:46.900 --> 33:48.800
And I hope so,

33:48.800 --> 33:52.000
because here's my contract
to replace yours.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.600
All you gotta do is
sign your name. . .

33:55.700 --> 33:57.600
and here's the dough.

33:59.300 --> 34:02.100
I don't have any contracts
with Hercules.

34:02.100 --> 34:03.900
He's my buddy. . .

34:04.000 --> 34:06.100
we just got each others' word.

34:06.200 --> 34:08.000
It makes it all the easier.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.900
Cuts the red tape.

34:09.900 --> 34:11.199
Sign your name.

34:11.300 --> 34:14.100
Fat Lips, Nitro and me
will take care of everything.

34:14.100 --> 34:15.199
Yeah.

34:16.199 --> 34:17.100
No.

34:17.199 --> 34:18.699
I ain't gonna do that.

34:19.500 --> 34:22.100
Hercules is my friend.
I ain't gonna sell him to nobody.

34:22.100 --> 34:25.000
Not to you, or him,
or him!

34:25.100 --> 34:27.699
Look, that boy of yours
is a comer.

34:27.699 --> 34:30.000
With my connections,
that boy's gonna be

34:30.000 --> 34:32.199
world champ in no time.

34:32.300 --> 34:34.699
What's a little runt like you
gonna do for him,

34:34.699 --> 34:37.800
except stand in his way?
And that don't fit in with my plans.

34:37.699 --> 34:38.800
Yeah.

34:40.800 --> 34:42.900
No,
I ain't gonna do it.

34:46.199 --> 34:47.000
Now, look. . .

34:48.100 --> 34:51.900
I'd like to do everything
nice and easy and legal.

34:51.800 --> 34:54.199
But if you wanna get tough,

34:54.199 --> 34:56.699
we can oblige you,
can't we, fellas?

34:57.500 --> 34:58.600
Yeah.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.100
Tell your boy
I'll be seeing him.

35:28.100 --> 35:29.300
( door closes )

35:57.700 --> 35:59.100
''Hercules. . .

35:59.300 --> 36:01.400
half god, half man,

36:01.500 --> 36:04.000
was the son of J upiter,
or Zeus--

36:04.100 --> 36:06.100
as he was known
to the Greeks--

36:06.100 --> 36:09.100
and a mortal mother
named Alcmene.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.900
As J uno,
Zeus' wife,

36:11.100 --> 36:14.600
was always hostile to
the offspring of her husband,

36:14.600 --> 36:16.400
by mortal mothers,

36:16.500 --> 36:19.800
she declared war against
Hercules from his birth.

36:19.800 --> 36:22.600
She sent two serpents
to destroy him

36:22.700 --> 36:24.600
as he lay in his cradle.

36:24.600 --> 36:28.300
But Hercules strangled them
with his hands.''

36:28.300 --> 36:30.300
Holy moley!

37:11.300 --> 37:13.400
I would speak with Nemesis.

37:23.700 --> 37:27.300
My son, Hercules,
who has set himself against me. . .

37:28.200 --> 37:31.400
is out in the world bringing
disrepute to his name.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.500
He has no business there.

37:33.600 --> 37:35.400
And where he is
is no place for him.

37:35.400 --> 37:37.300
I hear, Great Zeus.

37:38.800 --> 37:42.100
I charge you with a mission,

37:42.100 --> 37:45.100
as she who is the avenger
of my displeasures.

37:45.100 --> 37:47.200
I n all things, I obey.

37:47.300 --> 37:49.900
Go down to that continent
known as North America,

37:49.900 --> 37:52.300
to that city
known as New York.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.100
Take with you my wish

37:54.100 --> 37:57.000
that Hercules be punished
for setting himself against me,

37:57.000 --> 38:00.300
for demeaning that part
of him which is divine

38:00.400 --> 38:04.600
in rioting among the mortals
of that benighted place.

38:04.600 --> 38:05.500
Great Zeus,

38:05.600 --> 38:09.100
I beg you, hold your anger
against Hercules.

38:09.200 --> 38:11.000
He means no harm.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
He is simple,
and a bit childish.

38:13.100 --> 38:14.800
Give him a chance.

38:14.900 --> 38:17.900
Send me down there first
to persuade him to come back to us,

38:17.900 --> 38:20.400
before you give Nemesis
her task.

38:21.600 --> 38:24.400
- Yes, O Zeus.
- Heed Mercury's plea.

38:24.300 --> 38:26.200
Send Mercury for Hercules

38:26.300 --> 38:29.100
before you charge that dread
Nemesis with her mission.

38:29.000 --> 38:33.200
Venus also adds her voice
in asking Zeus to be patient

38:33.300 --> 38:35.800
and merciful.

38:35.800 --> 38:38.200
I don't wish to be
unduly harsh.

38:38.200 --> 38:41.600
But Hercules has been trying
my patience for centuries.

38:41.700 --> 38:43.600
Woman: Yet be indulgent,
Great Zeus.

38:43.600 --> 38:46.300
Send Mercury
to bring back Hercules.

38:46.300 --> 38:49.900
- Give him this chance.
- Let him stay down there.

38:50.400 --> 38:52.800
He's been an annoyance
from his cradle on.

38:52.800 --> 38:56.400
We all know why
you don't like Hercules.

38:56.400 --> 38:59.900
But surely, Great Zeus will not let
his judgement be affected

38:59.800 --> 39:02.500
- by J uno's malice.
- Malice!?

39:02.600 --> 39:04.400
- How dare you?
- All right. . .

39:04.500 --> 39:06.300
I don't want any arguments.

39:08.800 --> 39:10.200
So be it.

39:12.300 --> 39:15.000
- Mercury. . .
- Great Zeus.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.300
Tell Hercules it is
my wish

39:17.300 --> 39:20.000
he return to Olympus
without delay.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.800
Do not fail.

39:21.800 --> 39:24.300
- Now be gone.
- As Great Zeus commands.

39:30.400 --> 39:33.100
Is it wise, O Zeus,
to do this thing?

39:34.200 --> 39:37.600
If Hercules no longer finds
Olympus to his taste,

39:37.500 --> 39:40.200
then let him stay
where he is.

39:40.300 --> 39:43.800
Those down there will punish him
more than you ever would.

39:43.700 --> 39:47.200
They resent one who is different
from themselves.

39:47.300 --> 39:50.700
They will always try to
destroy him because of it.

39:50.600 --> 39:53.300
It is the habit
with these unhappy mortals.

39:53.300 --> 39:56.200
Hercules is my son,
not yours.

39:56.200 --> 39:58.800
I know you hate him, J uno,

39:58.900 --> 40:01.500
but we do not punish
in hate,

40:01.600 --> 40:03.400
only in sorrow.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.400
I have spoken.

40:16.900 --> 40:18.900
Oh look, you're famous.

40:18.900 --> 40:21.800
That is not Hercules.
And who is that monster

40:21.900 --> 40:24.700
who looks as if he came from
the kingdom of the underworld?

40:24.700 --> 40:25.900
Oh, no.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
This is a motion picture,
a play.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.400
You mustn't take yourself
so seriously.

40:30.500 --> 40:33.000
He doesn't even look like me.
Look.

40:34.100 --> 40:36.400
What are you doing?

40:36.400 --> 40:38.000
Oh, wow!

40:40.100 --> 40:41.900
Does he?

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
Listen. . .
I really. . .

40:43.100 --> 40:45.900
- Does he?
- I wish you'd put your shirt on.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.800
It isn't supposed
to look like anyone

40:47.900 --> 40:50.000
except the actor
who plays the part!

40:50.000 --> 40:51.900
What is the name
of that imitator?

40:51.900 --> 40:54.900
Who gave him permission
to pretend to be Hercules?

40:54.900 --> 40:57.200
Listen.
Stop joking.

40:57.300 --> 40:59.400
I think. . .
I think we ought to go.

40:59.400 --> 41:01.100
I nsolence.

41:06.600 --> 41:09.300
( church bell chimes )

41:32.900 --> 41:34.200
Hercules: What is that?

41:34.300 --> 41:36.000
It's Atlas
holding up the world.

41:36.100 --> 41:39.200
According to Greek mythology,
he was the one who. . .

41:39.300 --> 41:41.200
Atlas?

41:41.200 --> 41:43.600
- Yeah.
- Poor likeness.

41:43.600 --> 41:46.400
You have the oddest
sense of humor.

41:46.500 --> 41:49.400
Half the time I don't know
whether you're joking or not.

41:49.400 --> 41:52.300
Did your mother drop you
on your head as a baby?

41:52.200 --> 41:53.200
What happened?

41:53.400 --> 41:55.900
Once I strangled two serpents
in the cradle.

41:55.900 --> 41:57.600
Oh. . .

41:58.900 --> 42:01.600
Come along.
I'll show you more of our city.

42:01.700 --> 42:04.200
First, let's take a picture
of Atlas.

42:04.200 --> 42:05.500
Okay.

42:08.700 --> 42:09.700
( shutter clicks )

42:11.300 --> 42:13.200
And now of you.

42:16.800 --> 42:18.000
Smile.

42:27.300 --> 42:30.300
This fine food for only
a few small coins?

42:31.300 --> 42:34.400
They who run this place must be
public benefactors.

42:34.300 --> 42:36.200
Let's go and get a table.

42:40.300 --> 42:43.000
Very pretty.
I like New York very much.

42:43.100 --> 42:44.700
I'm glad.

42:44.700 --> 42:47.500
Perhaps you'll stay here longer
than you thought you might.

42:47.600 --> 42:48.500
Well,

42:48.600 --> 42:51.700
another hundred years,
at least.

42:51.700 --> 42:53.400
( giggling )

44:10.700 --> 44:13.200
- Greetings, Hercules.
- Mercury.

44:13.200 --> 44:15.700
- What brings you down here?
- You.

44:15.800 --> 44:18.900
- Zeus, he sent you?
- I am here at his command.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.200
Why?

44:20.200 --> 44:23.700
To ask you in Zeus' name
to return to Olympus with me.

44:23.600 --> 44:25.700
I don't wish to return yet.

44:25.900 --> 44:27.700
Zeus insists on it.

44:27.700 --> 44:29.200
I like it down here.

44:29.200 --> 44:31.800
Do not defy Zeus.
You can only suffer by it.

44:31.800 --> 44:33.800
He's all the time
nagging me.

44:33.800 --> 44:36.100
Mercury: It is out of the love
he bears you.

44:36.100 --> 44:38.200
When did you see
my father last?

44:38.300 --> 44:39.700
About five minutes ago.

44:39.900 --> 44:42.000
How did you leave things
in Olympus?

44:42.000 --> 44:44.700
About the same.
Everybody misses you.

44:44.700 --> 44:46.600
Hercules: J uno, too?

44:46.700 --> 44:49.000
Well, you know J uno
and her jealousy

44:49.100 --> 44:51.400
of every woman
Zeus looks twice at.

44:51.400 --> 44:54.400
Venus especially asked me
to give you her best wishes.

44:54.300 --> 44:56.400
Tell Zeus I'll come back
when I'm ready.

44:56.400 --> 44:59.200
I wouldn't want to do that.
You know how handy he is

44:59.200 --> 45:01.100
in throwing those thunderbolts
when he's angry.

45:01.100 --> 45:04.000
I'm not worried about
Zeus' thunderbolts down here.

45:04.100 --> 45:07.500
Zeus has another instrument
to punish those who offend him. . .

45:07.500 --> 45:08.400
Nemesis.

45:08.400 --> 45:10.900
He wouldn't send her
after me.

45:10.900 --> 45:13.400
It was only at the solicitation
of your friends

45:13.500 --> 45:16.700
that he sent me in her place
to make this plea for your return.

45:16.800 --> 45:19.400
Why can't the old man
let me alone?

45:19.500 --> 45:21.500
For the first time
in 2,000 years

45:21.500 --> 45:24.200
I'm enjoying myself
and he's trying to spoil it.

45:24.200 --> 45:26.500
This is no place for you.

45:26.500 --> 45:28.400
Everything is changing.

45:28.400 --> 45:31.700
Mortal man has no more belief
in the old ways.

45:31.700 --> 45:33.800
I'm enjoying myself,
just the same.

45:33.800 --> 45:36.800
- You are living a fallacy.
- It doesn't hurt me.

45:36.800 --> 45:39.200
Such overconfidence
could be ruinous.

45:41.200 --> 45:43.700
I'm going
to take a shower.

45:43.700 --> 45:46.300
Please, Hercules,
come back to Olympus.

45:48.800 --> 45:51.200
Now you're reasonable,
Mercury.

45:51.300 --> 45:53.600
And you're also
my half brother.

45:53.700 --> 45:55.600
What harm am I doing
down here?

45:55.600 --> 45:58.300
- You could do great harm.
- Harm to whom?

45:58.400 --> 46:01.000
- Yourself.
- What are you talking about?

46:01.100 --> 46:03.700
Hercules can only be
Hercules.

46:03.800 --> 46:07.300
You are confusing these mortals
with your behavior.

46:07.200 --> 46:09.200
Hercules: Ha!
I know a theater

46:09.300 --> 46:11.200
on the street named
Broadway.

46:11.200 --> 46:13.400
There's a man
who plays me so well.

46:13.400 --> 46:15.100
They shower money on him.

46:15.300 --> 46:17.000
It proves they know me.

46:17.100 --> 46:19.800
I must get back to Olympus.
I cannot delay.

46:19.800 --> 46:22.700
Zeus would hold it against me.
Are you coming back or not?

46:22.700 --> 46:23.900
No.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.500
Is that the message you would
have me deliver to Zeus?

46:26.500 --> 46:29.700
I will come sometime,
but not right now.

46:30.800 --> 46:32.600
Then I fear for you,
Hercules.

46:32.700 --> 46:36.000
Such obstinacy can have
only grave consequences.

46:36.100 --> 46:38.000
Give my regards to Venus.

46:38.000 --> 46:38.900
Right.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.300
She will be distressed to know
that you are defying your father.

46:42.300 --> 46:45.900
I'm not defying him. I just want
to stay here for a while.

46:46.000 --> 46:46.900
Farewell, then.

46:47.000 --> 46:50.700
I carry your words back
to Olympus with a heavy heart.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.400
If you will not take
my advice,

46:55.400 --> 46:58.200
then heed my caution:
beware of Nemesis.

46:59.500 --> 47:01.000
Goodbye, my half brother.

47:17.200 --> 47:19.200
I'm sure he meant well.

47:19.300 --> 47:21.300
But, but. . .
he. . .

47:21.400 --> 47:23.300
( stammering )

47:23.400 --> 47:24.800
Ooohh!

47:51.000 --> 47:52.300
Helen: You know what
I think?

47:52.400 --> 47:54.800
I think he's slightly
demented.

47:54.800 --> 47:58.000
Either that, or he's the world's
most dedicated joker.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.400
Perhaps he's suffering
from delusions of grandeur.

48:00.500 --> 48:04.000
His name is Hercules,
so he thinks he's Hercules.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.900
What's so terrible about that?

48:05.900 --> 48:07.800
We've heard of people
who think they're Napoleon.

48:07.800 --> 48:08.800
U h-huh.

48:08.900 --> 48:11.000
But they're in institutions.

48:11.100 --> 48:14.300
The young man's aberration
may be a mild megalomania.

48:14.300 --> 48:15.900
I don't care.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.400
I like him.
Even if he is a bit crazy.

48:18.400 --> 48:21.800
So do I , even if he did
crack two of my ribs.

48:21.800 --> 48:25.200
A Greek peasant with delusions
of mythological divinity.

48:25.200 --> 48:26.500
Fascinating.

48:26.500 --> 48:27.700
( doorbell rings )

48:29.400 --> 48:32.700
Open it up. . .
I've seen it, I've seen it.

48:32.700 --> 48:33.900
He opens up. . .

48:35.800 --> 48:38.000
I seen it!
I seen it!

48:38.100 --> 48:40.100
- I seen it.
- Pretzi, how are you?

48:40.200 --> 48:42.500
I seen it.
I seen it.

48:42.500 --> 48:44.900
He. . . he. . .
he flung himself

48:44.900 --> 48:47.200
right out the window--
head first--

48:47.200 --> 48:50.900
from the 23rd floor!
And then he fell straight up!

48:50.800 --> 48:52.700
What are you talking about,
Pretzi?

48:52.700 --> 48:54.600
I seen it
with my own eyes.

48:54.600 --> 48:56.600
What did you see, Pretzi?

48:56.800 --> 48:58.700
He called him, ''Mercury.''

48:58.800 --> 49:01.500
They were talking
about his old man.

49:01.500 --> 49:04.000
Seems he come over here
to get him to come home.

49:04.100 --> 49:06.000
But he don't wanna come home,

49:06.100 --> 49:08.700
so Mercury throws himself
out the window,

49:08.700 --> 49:10.500
straight up into the sky!

49:10.600 --> 49:12.600
Take it easy, Pretzi.

49:12.600 --> 49:15.000
- Get him a drink, Helen.
- No, please, no.

49:15.100 --> 49:17.900
No booze, no.
I think that's what did it.

49:17.800 --> 49:21.200
I don't know. I seen it. . .
clear as daylight.

49:21.300 --> 49:23.700
- A cup of coffee may help.
- Right, I'll get it.

49:23.800 --> 49:27.200
Now, Pretzi, I presume
you are talking about Hercules.

49:27.100 --> 49:28.900
Yeah, Hercules.
Right.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.900
Did you have anything
to drink?

49:30.900 --> 49:32.200
Well, I . . .

49:32.300 --> 49:34.300
I might have had a couple
of snorts.

49:34.300 --> 49:36.800
And how much is a couple?

49:36.800 --> 49:38.100
A pint.

49:38.200 --> 49:39.700
A pint?

49:39.800 --> 49:41.500
Well. . .
a fifth.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.800
Relax. A cup of black coffee,
and everything will be fine.

49:47.800 --> 49:50.100
Holy moley!
I tell ya. . .

49:50.200 --> 49:53.400
I've never seen anything
like this before in my whole life.

49:54.400 --> 49:55.900
( thunder )

50:00.700 --> 50:03.700
That was the answer Hercules
gave you to bring to me?

50:03.700 --> 50:06.500
It was not so insolent
as Zeus imagines.

50:06.600 --> 50:08.600
I n fact, Hercules spoke of you
with affection.

50:08.700 --> 50:11.500
- Yet he defied my command.
- But not in so many words.

50:11.500 --> 50:13.800
He said he would come back,
but not just yet.

50:13.800 --> 50:16.500
He dares to temporize with me!

50:16.500 --> 50:18.800
I'll blast him!

50:18.800 --> 50:20.000
Nemesis. . .

50:21.000 --> 50:22.700
come here!

50:31.800 --> 50:32.900
Nemesis. . .

50:34.300 --> 50:36.400
Can I talk with you
a moment, Nemesis?

50:36.400 --> 50:39.900
Make it brief, O wife to Zeus.
I am on a mission.

50:41.600 --> 50:45.500
What punishment did my
husband decree for Hercules?

50:46.400 --> 50:49.300
It is for him to tell you,
not I .

50:49.200 --> 50:52.100
It is for you to tell me
when I ask!

50:52.200 --> 50:54.000
Am I not wife to Zeus?

50:54.000 --> 50:56.300
I order you!

50:56.300 --> 51:00.400
I am to convey Hercules to
the underworld kingdom of Pluto

51:00.500 --> 51:03.600
where he is to remain
for a hundred years.

51:04.600 --> 51:07.000
What kind of a punishment
is that?

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Hercules will have
the time of his life

51:09.100 --> 51:12.800
roistering about
with that lecher.

51:12.700 --> 51:15.500
Pluto is the king
of all evil pleasures.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.600
If it is Zeus' thought that
Hercules should reside in hell. . .

51:21.600 --> 51:24.500
I have a keener one for him.

51:24.600 --> 51:27.400
Let him stay where he is.

51:27.400 --> 51:30.100
But Earth is where
Hercules wishes to be.

51:30.200 --> 51:31.200
Yes. . .

51:31.200 --> 51:33.400
but as Hercules.

51:33.500 --> 51:36.900
- I don't understand.
- With all his great strength,

51:37.000 --> 51:40.200
it sets him apart
from other mortals.

51:40.200 --> 51:42.900
They might even make
him king because of it.

51:42.900 --> 51:45.400
They have no kings
where Hercules is.

51:45.400 --> 51:47.300
They're called ''presidents.''

51:48.500 --> 51:50.300
A king by any other name,

51:50.300 --> 51:53.600
in his heart still thinks
of himself as king.

51:53.600 --> 51:56.200
J uno delays me.
I must leave.

51:56.200 --> 51:58.500
What does she have in mind?

52:00.100 --> 52:02.800
Hercules' divinity.

52:02.800 --> 52:04.900
His divinity?

52:05.000 --> 52:08.800
Since he seems to like it so well
where he presently is,

52:08.700 --> 52:11.800
I shall give him a taste
of what it truly means.

52:11.800 --> 52:14.500
He shall become one of
those wretched mortals

52:14.600 --> 52:17.500
he finds it so fascinating
to be among.

52:17.500 --> 52:20.500
But Hercules is a demigod.

52:21.500 --> 52:23.800
Thanks to my husband's
philanderings.

52:23.800 --> 52:27.500
I can't take away Hercules'
divinity permanently. . .

52:28.600 --> 52:32.100
but I can make him
as other men for a while. . .

52:33.900 --> 52:37.700
as long as the effects from
the powder in this ring last.

52:38.800 --> 52:40.500
Hope for the best.

52:41.600 --> 52:44.000
Open the face of this ring.

52:44.000 --> 52:47.100
Pour the powder within
into Hercules' drink.

52:48.200 --> 52:50.100
Then he will become
as other men,

52:50.200 --> 52:52.200
no better,

52:52.400 --> 52:55.000
and as vulnerable
as any of them.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.800
It could mean that
Hercules could. . .

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
- Yes.
- He could get killed.

52:59.100 --> 53:00.700
It might.

53:02.500 --> 53:04.200
J uno, I dare not.

53:04.300 --> 53:06.600
I cannot take part
in undermining. . .

53:07.800 --> 53:10.000
the will of the gods.

53:10.000 --> 53:11.700
Do my bidding. . .

53:13.300 --> 53:16.700
or when I have Zeus
here in private

53:16.700 --> 53:19.600
I might tell him
a few things about you.

53:28.300 --> 53:29.600
And one more thing. . .

53:30.600 --> 53:33.700
on your way back,
make a little detour.

53:33.700 --> 53:35.800
Go see Pluto.

53:35.800 --> 53:37.800
I have a message for him.

54:10.700 --> 54:13.200
Pluto: Forgive the barking.
It's only Cerberus.

54:13.200 --> 54:15.300
Nemesis: Seems to have
quite an argument.

54:15.300 --> 54:17.900
He does that sometimes
when he's angry at himself.

54:17.900 --> 54:19.500
It's those three heads,
you know.

54:19.500 --> 54:21.800
How have you been,
Pluto?

54:21.800 --> 54:24.300
Pretty nifty, except it's been
a hell of a day.

54:24.300 --> 54:27.600
A new shipload.
Ha! Look who's here.

54:27.600 --> 54:29.600
I'd ask you in,
but it's a mess.

54:29.700 --> 54:32.200
Thanks, but I wouldn't
have time for just a visit.

54:33.400 --> 54:36.200
You say that Hercules
is the same as

54:36.200 --> 54:38.900
all those foolish mortals
he finds himself among?

54:38.900 --> 54:40.800
Temporarily.

54:40.800 --> 54:43.600
Zeus has decreed
that Hercules should spend

54:43.600 --> 54:46.600
the next hundred years
down here.

54:46.700 --> 54:49.300
There has been an argument
between the two of them.

54:49.300 --> 54:51.100
And so J uno, um. . .

54:51.200 --> 54:55.700
wants you to have the opportunity
to make the most of this.

54:55.600 --> 54:58.500
What a triumph! What a coup!
What a feather in my cap!

54:58.500 --> 55:00.800
To snatch the soul
of a demigod!

55:00.900 --> 55:03.700
- When can I expect Hercules?
- That's the problem.

55:03.600 --> 55:05.300
He refuses to obey Zeus.

55:05.400 --> 55:07.100
Then he won't come.
Drat!

55:07.100 --> 55:08.700
Not voluntarily.

55:08.800 --> 55:11.700
He must bring him
involuntarily.

55:11.700 --> 55:13.500
And J uno has. . .

55:13.600 --> 55:15.600
facilitated matters.

55:15.600 --> 55:18.200
Surely J uno realizes
that I am no murderer.

55:18.200 --> 55:20.800
- I only punish.
- She understands that,

55:20.800 --> 55:22.400
of course.

55:24.000 --> 55:27.500
But she also knows
that you are ingenious.

55:27.400 --> 55:30.300
And what she can't
accomplish by one means,

55:30.400 --> 55:34.200
she is sure that you are
likely to achieve by another.

55:34.200 --> 55:35.700
You know, that is true.

55:35.900 --> 55:38.300
I always thought of myself
as a god of ideas.

55:38.300 --> 55:41.200
Then I'll leave the matter
in your hands.

55:41.100 --> 55:42.700
Goodbye.

55:42.900 --> 55:44.500
Goodbye.

56:18.400 --> 56:21.100
Pluto: I didn't mind climbing
all those stairs to get here,

56:21.100 --> 56:23.100
but heights make me dizzy.

56:23.200 --> 56:26.000
I'm not accustomed
to the altitude.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.200
( chuckles )

56:27.300 --> 56:28.500
Have you decided?

56:29.600 --> 56:31.600
I don't care what Zeus
has decreed.

56:31.700 --> 56:33.500
I'm not coming with you.

56:33.500 --> 56:36.300
- Some other century, perhaps?
- It'll be safer for you.

56:36.400 --> 56:39.700
Safer? Hercules is a god,
and safe wherever he goes.

56:39.700 --> 56:41.400
Things can change.

56:41.400 --> 56:43.800
You're being ridiculous.

56:45.700 --> 56:47.600
J ust listen to me for a minute.

56:47.700 --> 56:50.500
You'll enjoy yourself.
You'll have a hell of a time.

56:50.500 --> 56:53.600
I don't know what the occasion was
that prompted this influx of. . .

56:53.600 --> 56:56.000
beautiful women. . .
- Go away.

56:56.000 --> 56:57.800
- You bother me.
- J ust listen.

56:57.800 --> 57:00.200
I n this briefcase
I happen to have a contract

57:00.300 --> 57:02.700
that was drawn up by the best
legal minds in the world,

57:02.800 --> 57:06.600
who at the moment are involuntarily
the recipients of my hospitality.

57:06.600 --> 57:07.900
What is it to me?

57:07.900 --> 57:10.200
I mean if you play
your cards right

57:10.300 --> 57:13.100
I can see that you can get
any one of those dames, women,

57:13.200 --> 57:15.500
who might tickle your,
eh, fancy.

57:15.500 --> 57:17.200
So just sign
on the dotted line,

57:17.200 --> 57:19.000
and I'll take care of
everything else.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.100
Why don't you
go back to hell!

57:21.100 --> 57:23.300
You've been away
too long already.

57:23.400 --> 57:25.200
Who is taking care of things?

57:25.300 --> 57:27.300
Who is feeding Cerberus?

57:27.300 --> 57:30.700
How did you get here?
You always shun the light.

57:30.600 --> 57:33.900
Nosy parker.
Did you notice how dark it was?

57:35.100 --> 57:37.200
- So this is your doing?
- Um-hmm.

57:38.900 --> 57:40.800
How about signing
on the dotted line?

57:40.800 --> 57:43.500
No. If you don't stop
annoying me, I . . .

57:43.600 --> 57:45.000
Listen, I'm not. . .

57:45.100 --> 57:46.600
I'm not afraid of you.

57:47.600 --> 57:49.500
Hey, that's terrific,

57:49.500 --> 57:51.500
but I'm also a god.

57:51.500 --> 57:54.700
- I can try.
- You can try? Listen.

57:56.200 --> 57:58.100
I'll see you later.

57:58.200 --> 58:00.400
We'll be in touch.

58:00.400 --> 58:02.100
You're gonna. . .
hear from me.

58:03.700 --> 58:06.300
I'll see you again sometime. . .

58:06.400 --> 58:10.100
when you're run down.

58:23.800 --> 58:26.200
Said on the phone
he'd meet us here.

58:26.200 --> 58:29.500
Said we'd recognize him
by the briefcase he'd be carrying.

58:29.500 --> 58:31.300
Here he comes.

58:40.700 --> 58:43.600
You weren't kidding about what
you said on the phone, were ya?

58:43.600 --> 58:44.900
Certainly not.

58:47.200 --> 58:49.300
Sure you'll be able
to handle it?

58:49.400 --> 58:51.300
Man: Twenty thousand dollars?

58:51.400 --> 58:52.400
5 to 1 .

58:55.900 --> 58:58.300
Okay, pal, it's a bet.

58:58.300 --> 59:00.700
You're laying 20 grand
at 5 to 1

59:00.800 --> 59:02.600
on Hercules to lose?

59:10.500 --> 59:11.900
The money.

59:14.400 --> 59:16.400
What's your name?

59:16.500 --> 59:17.600
Where do you hang out?
Where can I reach you?

59:17.800 --> 59:20.900
Don't worry about that.
All in good time.

59:20.800 --> 59:23.200
We shall meet again.

59:23.300 --> 59:25.500
Mmmmm. . .
Be assured of that.

59:25.600 --> 59:27.800
Well, goodbye. . .

59:27.900 --> 59:29.700
for the present.

59:31.100 --> 59:33.200
Till next time.

59:39.800 --> 59:42.600
I don't like
that guy's looks.

59:42.700 --> 59:45.200
He gives me the creeps.

59:45.300 --> 59:46.900
He's dangerous.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.200
I wouldn't welsh on him
if I was you.

59:50.500 --> 59:52.400
What's to welsh?

59:52.500 --> 59:55.000
Hercules is a cinch to win,
right?

59:56.300 --> 59:58.600
If you say so.

59:58.600 --> 01:00:01.400
He'll walk into a room
he won't walk out of

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.300
if he don't come through
for me.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.600
Twenty grand, huh?

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:08.800
That's a lot of dough.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.700
Figure this guy knows
something we don't know?

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.400
What could he know?

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.700
He's a long shot plunger!

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:17.800
( laughing )

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.600
- Disturbing you?
- No, dear, come in.

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:46.800
Did you see
today's newspaper?

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:49.300
Not yet.
Anything of special interest?

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:51.300
An item
in Wesley Watkins' column.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.500
Listen. . .

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:55.000
''New Yorkers are talking
about the claim

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.300
of champion wrestling contender,
Hercules the Great

01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:59.500
that he's the strongest man
in the world.''

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.500
I wouldn't be inclined
to dispute that.

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.000
Someone does. Listen.

01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:05.700
''Foremost among those
to dispute this statement

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:08.200
is circus strongman,
Monstro the Magnificent.

01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:10.600
He declares himself
as willing to put up

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:14.200
$1 0,000 on the outcome
of a weightlifting contest.''

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:16.800
There's a man with
his work cut out for him.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.500
''Broadway scuttlebutt has it

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:21.200
that the matter
may be settled

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:23.700
on a national variety
television program.''

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:27.100
I personally have no doubt
as to the outcome.

01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:30.400
Hi!
Came to wish you luck.

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.400
Thank you.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.300
Father's out front
rooting for you, too.

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:35.000
I'm glad for it.

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:36.700
Man: How's it going, pal?

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:39.800
- Greetings.
- All set for the big match?

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.800
- It doesn't bother me.
- You'll take him, all right.

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:46.000
- What can stop me?
- Glad to hear you say that.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.200
I got a lot of dough spread out
on those muscles of yours.

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:52.000
- Don't worry.
- I'm not worrying.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.300
J ust reminding you that if
anything goes wrong,

01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:58.300
I'm not gonna like losing
all that money,

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.300
and you won't like it,
either.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.800
I understand. It is not pleasant
to lose money

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.000
once one becomes
accustomed to its use.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.300
Yeah. I don't back losers. . .

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:08.700
ever!

01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:10.100
Very practical.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.400
So don't lose.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.900
Who was that?

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:21.400
I believe
he was threatening you.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.600
- He was?
- Yes!

01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:26.500
If you don't win,
he means to harm you.

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.700
Who can harm Hercules?

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.800
He's a bad guy, Herc.
Gee. . .

01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:34.100
I wish we didn't have nothing
to do with him.

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:35.900
You're okay, ain't you?

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.100
I'm fine.

01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:39.300
PA: Hercules the Great
on stage!

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:41.100
Well, that's you.

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.000
I'll see you later.
Good luck.

01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:45.000
Thanks a lot.
Okay, Herc,

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:47.700
you're all ready.
Remember everything I told you.

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:50.800
You won't forget. Whatever you do,
don't get nervous.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.700
I mean, just. . . just. . .
keep calm.

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:55.400
Don't strain yourself because
you could get a hernia.

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:58.400
Whatever you do, Herc,
just stay calm.

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.500
And listen, Herc,

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:03.000
watch out for Monstro. . .

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.800
Wasn't he something,
folks?

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.300
And now we have a special
treat for all you girls and guys.

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:12.300
An exhibition of
the defense of manly art.

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:15.100
Speculation throughout
the city has been rife.

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:18.400
Who is the strongest?
Monstro the Magnificent?

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.400
( cheers and applause )

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:24.300
Ooh, hey!

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:27.800
Or Hercules the Great?
Let's bring Herc on.

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.900
You go out there
and get him.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.500
Remember what I taught you.
Don't forget, now.

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:37.400
There he goes.
Very glad to have you on the show.

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:39.500
Whew!

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:42.700
Now this contest of strength
will begin with the challenger,

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:45.800
Monstro the Magnificent,
who will snatch, press. . .

01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:48.200
- That's ''clean and jerk.''
- I'm sorry.

01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:51.200
Who will clean and jerk
barbells weighing. . .

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.600
- 500 pounds?
- 500.

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:54.200
500 pounds!

01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:55.700
( applause )

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.600
( drum roll )

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.600
Host: Let's give him
a great big hand!

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:13.400
Monstro the Magnificent.

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.100
( applause )

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:19.700
And now Hercules the Great.
500 pounds.

01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:21.400
( applause )

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:43.700
( applause )

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:49.200
And now,
item number two.

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:51.200
7 50 pounds.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:54.300
Monstro the Magnificent.
Let's give him a hand.

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:56.900
( applause )

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.300
( drum roll )

01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:10.900
Not now, dum-dum.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.400
Wonderful.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.700
And now, Hercules the Great.

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:17.000
7 50 pounds.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.800
( applause )

01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:51.600
For Hercules, 7 50 pounds,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.500
( applause )

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:57.700
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
in this struggle of the titans,

01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:00.100
One thousand pounds!

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:02.500
Monstro the Magnificent.

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.400
Let's hear it for Monstro!

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.100
( applause )

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:21.300
Host: Ladies and gentlemen,
Monstro the Magnificent!

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.500
( applause )

01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:29.400
Whoa, look at that!
Look at that!

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:32.600
Wonderful! Wonderful!
Monstro the Magnificent!

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.400
Host: And now,
Hercules the Great.

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.600
One thousand pounds.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Double cross.

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:18.600
( groaning )

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:24.000
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's have a hand for Hercules.

01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:28.400
A real effort.
A real effort.

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:31.200
Host: And now the winner,
Monstro the Magnificent!

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.500
But, but what happened?

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:39.300
I don't know!
I could not lift it.

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:42.200
My strength,
it seemed to have gone.

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.100
Come on,
we gotta get out of here!

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:46.800
There's no time to get dressed.
We'll go this way.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.100
Down the fire escape!

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:51.600
Let's hear it,
ladies and gentlemen. Come on!

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.300
Let's hear it for Monstro!

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.200
( applause )

01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:58.400
Father, this is terrible.
We've got to go!

01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:59.500
Why, Helen?

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:01.500
- Come on.
- What's happened?

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:04.100
Hercules is in trouble.

01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:07.600
Although that represents
no novelty, I find it forbidding.

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:09.500
He brought it on himself.

01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:13.200
One thing
I do not understand. . .

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:17.600
I did not decree that Hercules
should be bereft of his divinity.

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:20.500
It was my edict that
he be sent to Pluto's kingdom

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:22.700
for a hundred years.

01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:25.500
How, then, has this
other thing happened?

01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:29.399
Can nobody tell me?

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:34.100
- Eros!
- Yes, sir, Zeus.

01:08:37.399 --> 01:08:40.700
Find Nemesis.
Bring her to me.

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:42.399
At once,
my liege Zeus.

01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:55.100
He should have been
back here by now.

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.500
His duds are here.

01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:00.899
Which means he ain't
coming back here!

01:09:00.899 --> 01:09:03.399
Outside!
Get the boys!

01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:04.700
Get the boys.

01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:06.300
Get the boys.

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:26.600
There goes the dame.

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:29.399
The big phony and the runt
must be inside. Let's go.

01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:31.200
They're probably on the floor.

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:45.500
Follow them.
Don't lose them.

01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:59.000
She left without
saying goodbye.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
But don't you see
what she's doing?

01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:04.700
She trying to draw them away
so we can escape.

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:06.600
You said those men
were dangerous.

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.700
Dangerous!
Boy, I'll say.

01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:12.300
- H urry!
- Where you going?

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.900
We have to stop those men.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.400
On foot? You're gonna
chase them on foot?

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:19.800
- With the chariot.
- Chariot? What chariot?

01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:21.900
That's not a chariot.
What are you doing?

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:28.400
Now he's done it!

01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:31.500
Man: Hey, come back
with my chariot!

01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:39.800
Hey, Mister!
Wait for your sauerkraut!

01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:56.700
Man: Hey ''Muscles,'' that ain't
the way to Disneyland!

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:11.500
( cars honking )

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:33.400
We'll make mincemeat
out of those guys.

01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:36.300
- Coming up to a red light.
- Forget about the light.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:03.500
Cut them off at the zoo.

01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:05.300
Don't let those punks
get away.

01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:55.900
Where is everybody?

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.600
( car honking )

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.500
Where did that monster go
with my chariot?!

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:11.400
I want my chariot.

01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:19.700
Helen: We're out of gas!

01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:27.800
Let's get in there!

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:29.700
Hercules doesn't flee
from anybody.

01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:31.600
Come on, Herc!
No time to argue!

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:44.000
Zeus sent for me?

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:47.400
When I ordered you
down to Earth,

01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:49.300
did I not charge you to see
that Hercules

01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:50.800
was delivered
to the realm of Pluto?

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.400
- It is as Zeus says.
- Then, what happened?

01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:57.900
How is it that Hercules was
instead deprived of his divinity,

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.100
his strength,

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:02.000
and finds himself in his
present mortal predicament?

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:04.500
Well. . .?

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:07.900
Well!?

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.400
I was sent on another mission.
The substitute.

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:15.300
Who gave you another mission
to supersede that of mine?

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:19.900
Speak up, or I will blast you
where you stand!

01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:29.400
( tires squeal )

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.500
Here comes Tony.

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:34.600
- Where's all the other guys?
- I n the other cars.

01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:36.700
Okay, you take a couple of boys
and go in that door,

01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:39.200
all the other guys,
come with me.

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:53.300
Where are we going?

01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:56.300
That way!

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:36.500
Now, Nemesis,
speak or I'll. . . !

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:40.400
No! No, Mighty Zeus.

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:42.400
I beg you!

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.300
It was J uno.

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.400
She bade me do what I did.

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:50.400
So, interfering again.

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:54.900
I've told you I will not tolerate
your everlasting interference.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000
I thought it best,
to save a lot of trouble.

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:05.000
I will discuss this
with you later.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.300
Zeus, will you not save
Hercules?

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:12.000
Let him abide
by the consequences

01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:14.400
of his own folly
and obstinacy.

01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:30.300
Oh, no. Herc!

01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:43.300
Hercules is in great peril.

01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:47.000
If Zeus does not relent,
there's nothing we can do.

01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:49.100
- There is.
- What?

01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:52.100
We may send aid
to Hercules.

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:54.400
We?
Send help to Hercules?

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:56.200
You know where to find them.

01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:58.300
And they'll listen to you.
I know they will.

01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:01.200
- Who?
- Atlas and Samson.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.100
Hercules! Get up!
Come up here!

01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:24.200
- Come on, Hercules.
- Hercules, get up!

01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:25.500
He's not coming.

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:34.200
Are you all right, boy?

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:37.400
You all right?

01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:47.200
Go get them!
Come on, go get them!

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:28.300
Who sent Atlas and Samson
to Hercules' aid?

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:32.300
Is it not enough that Hercules
has been causing

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:34.100
all that trouble
by himself?

01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:36.700
Call those other two away,
at once.

01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:42.400
Mercury. . .?

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:46.700
- Zeus?
- Was it you?

01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:49.900
It was I .

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:54.800
How dare you
go above my head?

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:57.900
I feared
for Hercules' safety.

01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:00.900
Bereft of his strength,
he's as helpless as a child

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
in the world of mortal men.

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.300
It is not to be borne.

01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:09.800
Hercules treated as a common
mortal by those scoundrels.

01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:11.800
Then save him, Mighty Zeus!

01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:14.600
He deserves all he's getting.

01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:18.300
When I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it.

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:22.100
Hercules is a son of Zeus.

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.200
I n treating him as they do,

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:28.600
those scoundrels down there
show disrespect for his father.

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:30.500
Then save him,
Great Zeus,

01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:33.500
even if it is only because
he is your son.

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:11.700
No mortal shall ever triumph
over a son of Zeus!

01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:25.300
( thunder )

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.700
I don't see nothing.

01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:05.800
It's all very dark
in there.

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.600
Fire torpedo!

01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:11.400
Aw, you gotta put
a dime in.

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:13.000
Forget it.

01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:18.200
You can see
all the way to Jersey!

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:20.500
It's really something, huh?

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:22.600
I've never been up here,
you know.

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:24.700
Kind of makes you
feel like. . .

01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:27.200
some sort of god
or something.

01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:30.400
Too bad it's a little
cloudy today.

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:32.900
Well, you can still see
pretty far.

01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:35.700
I can see the whole river.

01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:38.900
Look at that big boat
down there.

01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:42.000
You know, Herc,

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.500
that looks like the boat
you were on.

01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:47.400
Take a look at it, Herc,
I think it's. . .

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:49.100
Hey, Herc?

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:50.700
Where'd you go, Herc?

01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:52.800
I have been willful.

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.900
I have been disobedient.

01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:58.700
Mighty Zeus has more wisdom
than Hercules.

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:01.200
He knew better
what is best for him.

01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:03.000
Please, Mighty Zeus, relent.

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.500
You'll be sorry.

01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:10.000
Zeus has only to speak now

01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:12.000
for Hercules to obey.

01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:13.800
( thunder )

01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:20.700
Herc?

01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:22.600
Where'd you go, Herc?

01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:24.200
Hey, Herc!

01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:28.600
Herc!

01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:06.900
H uh, strongest guy
in the world. . .

01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:11.500
tying up with a nothing
like me.

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:13.000
Imagine. . .

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:17.700
He really made me feel
like something. . .

01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:20.700
a half-pint like me.

01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:23.100
I ain't never gonna
forget him.

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.000
Never.

01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:30.600
Only, where did he go?

01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:34.800
( jazz music )

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Radio: Don't grieve,
my friend.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.900
I n the memory
that leaves you,

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.200
separation may have
a quiet happiness all its own.

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:43.500
Herc?

01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:46.600
We are friends, you and I .

01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:48.600
And nothing can
take that from us.

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:49.900
Herc?

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.100
Herc!
Where are you, Herc?

01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:56.700
What are you doing
in my radio?

01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:58.100
Herc. . .

01:24:58.300 --> 01:25:00.300
It's me! It's Pretzi!

01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:04.600
Why did you take a powder like that?
Why did you just leave?

01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:09.400
I didn't say anything
out of line, did I?

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:12.500
Or do nothing?
Did I , Herc?

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:15.500
I enjoyed knowing you,
my little friend.

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:18.200
Gee, Herc.

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:20.400
Ain't I never gonna
see you again?

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:22.700
Ain't you never
coming back?

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.800
Even for a visit?

01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:26.800
'Cause if you ain't,

01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:29.000
it's sure gonna be
lonesome for me again.

01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:34.100
Herc, we really did
all them things, didn't we?

01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:36.900
I didn't just imagine
all them things, did I?

01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:39.800
It wasn't like what
the head shrinkers call,

01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:42.200
''wishful thinking,''
was it, Herc?

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:47.500
Radio: Any time you wish me
to be with you,

01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:50.000
all you need to do
is think of me.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.500
and there I shall be,

01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:54.100
in your mind
and in your heart. . .

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:56.100
for as long as
you want me to be,

01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:57.900
as long as you need me.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.700
Radio: Due to temporary
atmospheric difficulties,

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.900
we were interrupted
in our broadcast.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.200
We resume. . .

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:07.000
Herc?

01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:08.100
Herc?

01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:16.400
''Any time you need me,

01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:19.900
any time you want me,

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.800
just think of me,

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:23.800
and I'll be there

01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:26.500
for as long as
you want me to.''

01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:28.800
Yeah.

01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:33.500
I think I'll eat an apple.

01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:38.100
And this is what I saw
on the world below.

01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:41.100
It all sounds
revoltingly noisy.

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:48.800
Leave me, now.

01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:52.000
I would think
on what I've been told.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.800
You, too, my love.

01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:49.000
( screaming )

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.600
( screaming continues )
