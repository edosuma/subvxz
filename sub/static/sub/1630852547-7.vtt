00:02.895 --> 00:04.394
-Hey, Oscar.
-Morning, Kat.

00:04.488 --> 00:05.504
Hey, Randi.
I'm so pumped.

00:05.731 --> 00:07.172
I actually have a reason
to be here today--

00:07.324 --> 00:10.050
besides the hot coffee
and even hotter café owner.

00:10.845 --> 00:13.070
-Randi, for you.
-Oh!

00:13.239 --> 00:15.163
I love shopping
after a few glasses of wine.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.516
It's like drunk me
sending sober me presents.

00:17.667 --> 00:18.833
I wonder what it is.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.336
Two packs of cotton balls
and a candle.

00:21.430 --> 00:22.746
Delivery driver skill.

00:22.839 --> 00:24.431
I can tell what's in a package
just by shaking it.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.673
Uh, that's amazing.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.842
-What flavor candle?
-I'm not a magician.

00:27.862 --> 00:29.194
I mean,
I dabbled a bit in high school,

00:29.421 --> 00:31.755
but a dove died,
and I hung up my cape.

00:31.774 --> 00:34.608
Just when I thought
you couldn't get any sexier.

00:34.760 --> 00:37.369
The magic and the cape,
not the dead bird.

00:37.596 --> 00:40.539
It's nice you two
found each other.

00:41.767 --> 00:43.208
Katharine,
I got here as soon as I could.

00:43.360 --> 00:46.603
You said there was
a fashion emergency?

00:46.622 --> 00:47.954
I see I'm too late.

00:48.107 --> 00:50.274
Okay, I didn't really
have a fashion emergency.

00:50.367 --> 00:51.792
I just wanted
to get you out of the house.

00:51.944 --> 00:54.111
You've been in hiding
since you and Preston broke up.

00:54.129 --> 00:57.464
I don't know where you learned
such trickery and manipulation.

00:57.616 --> 01:01.285
-(sighs)
-But give me a free biscotti,
and I'll consider forgiving you.

01:01.287 --> 01:03.637
Yes, wherever did I learn it?

01:04.398 --> 01:06.548
Hey, Sheila.
How you holding up?

01:06.567 --> 01:07.808
(sighs)

01:07.960 --> 01:10.294
A little lonesome,
but I'm surviving.

01:10.387 --> 01:12.905
Aw. Well, at least you have that
trip to Bora Bora coming up.

01:13.132 --> 01:14.815
I know a beach
always makes me feel better.

01:14.967 --> 01:16.300
Not me. I hate beaches.

01:16.468 --> 01:18.985
Not the movie-- that's pure
cinematic perfection.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.061
(smacks lips)

01:20.081 --> 01:21.580
Oh, I'm not going.

01:21.731 --> 01:22.639
What?

01:22.732 --> 01:24.065
Wh-Why not?

01:24.085 --> 01:28.495
(scoffs) Only truckers
and serial killers travel alone.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.314
Well, then take a friend.

01:30.407 --> 01:31.164
Who?

01:31.258 --> 01:32.407
(Phil clears throat)

01:32.426 --> 01:34.075
What about Margaret
from the club?

01:34.095 --> 01:35.410
No, thanks.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.595
She's become so needy

01:36.822 --> 01:38.822
since she found out
I was a bone marrow match.

01:38.915 --> 01:40.582
(clears throat)

01:40.601 --> 01:41.583
Okay.

01:41.602 --> 01:42.826
What about Betty?

01:42.995 --> 01:44.328
TSA nightmare.

01:44.346 --> 01:46.921
She has a titanium hip
and a steel plate in her head.

01:46.941 --> 01:48.682
It's like traveling
with the Tin Man.

01:48.834 --> 01:50.792
(Phil clears throat)

01:50.853 --> 01:53.261
Take a sip of water
or something, for God's sake.

01:53.430 --> 01:56.264
Uh, Sheila, I think
he's offering to go with you.

01:56.433 --> 01:58.508
That, or he has a hair ball.

01:59.194 --> 02:02.454
Phil, would you like
to go with me

02:02.681 --> 02:03.455
-to Bora Bora?
-Yes.

02:03.682 --> 02:04.706
(laughter)

02:05.826 --> 02:07.017
Then it's settled.

02:07.035 --> 02:08.610
-(chuckles)
-I've got to go pack.

02:08.629 --> 02:11.688
Uh, oh, don't forget
to change that dreadful shirt.

02:11.781 --> 02:12.873
(Phil gasps excitedly)

02:12.967 --> 02:15.283
I'm going to Bora Bora.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.619
But I don't want
to leave you two in the lurch.

02:17.713 --> 02:19.396
Phil, you have to go.

02:19.398 --> 02:20.714
Okay.

02:20.866 --> 02:23.049
Listen, I will leave dough

02:23.202 --> 02:25.460
and premade pastries
in the freezer.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.721
Thank you so much!

02:27.815 --> 02:30.374
Do you think we should
hire someone for a few days?

02:30.467 --> 02:33.226
Oh, well, I don't want to do
all the extra work,

02:33.379 --> 02:36.488
but I also don't want
to meet a new person.

02:36.715 --> 02:37.898
If you need
an extra pair of hands,

02:38.050 --> 02:39.307
I have a ton of vacation days
saved up.

02:39.401 --> 02:41.234
-Happy to help out.
-You would do that for us?

02:41.328 --> 02:43.887
-Of course.
-Oh, that's so nice. Thank you.

02:43.906 --> 02:45.164
Handsome and helpful.

02:45.315 --> 02:46.648
You're the total package.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.483
Delivery driver pun intended.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.576
Good one.

02:49.728 --> 02:50.669
Pew, pew.

02:51.563 --> 02:54.155
Again, so nice you two
found each other.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.400
♪<i> Me, oh, my, oh, my, oh, me</i> ♪

02:56.418 --> 02:58.969
♪<i> Nothin' wrong with you</i>
<i> but I'd rather be me.</i> ♪

02:59.680 --> 03:01.221
Have a great day.

03:01.998 --> 03:03.256
I'm having a blast.

03:03.409 --> 03:04.090
Me, too!

03:04.167 --> 03:05.258
You fit right in.

03:05.352 --> 03:06.910
And I love that
you moved the cups.

03:06.929 --> 03:07.911
So much more efficient.

03:07.930 --> 03:09.262
Well, I did win an award

03:09.415 --> 03:11.023
for most efficient carrier
at my other job.

03:11.174 --> 03:12.691
-(chuckles softly)
-Where they pay me.

03:12.842 --> 03:14.359
Uh, I pay you in kisses.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.819
I accept that.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.012
Uh, if there's a policy change,

03:18.032 --> 03:20.273
I'd like to go on record,
I prefer cash.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.092
Randi, did you see
what he did with the cups?

03:22.110 --> 03:24.519
Yes, I saw what he did
with the cups.

03:24.596 --> 03:26.205
I saw what
he did with the straws.

03:26.432 --> 03:27.689
I saw what he did
with the napkins.

03:27.783 --> 03:29.374
Nothing in this café
is where it's supposed to be.

03:29.601 --> 03:31.284
Really? I think
it's so much more intuitive.

03:31.437 --> 03:33.378
Yeah, I mean, we were keeping
the straws and the lids,

03:33.530 --> 03:34.955
like, a mile away
from each other.

03:35.107 --> 03:37.274
Now they're practically making
love, which is always good.

03:37.292 --> 03:39.701
On the truck, I like to say

03:39.869 --> 03:41.962
"organization equals
optimization."

03:42.114 --> 03:43.388
Okay, who does he say that to?

03:43.615 --> 03:44.631
He drives alone.

03:44.783 --> 03:46.299
Okay, I'm gonna take my break,

03:46.393 --> 03:48.710
but I'm also gonna take
this trash with me, because...

03:48.729 --> 03:50.229
efficiency.

03:50.456 --> 03:53.807
(chuckles) You know, it's
so nice for Oscar to help out,

03:53.901 --> 03:55.234
but he's making a lot of changes

03:55.385 --> 03:57.677
for someone who's been here for,
you know, three hours.

03:57.829 --> 03:59.071
Impressive, huh?

03:59.222 --> 04:00.146
I mean, I guess.

04:00.241 --> 04:01.631
I just don't know why

04:01.650 --> 04:02.983
we're trying to fix something
that isn't broken.

04:03.077 --> 04:04.576
I mean, did you see
that he put out

04:04.728 --> 04:06.078
comment cards for the customers?

04:06.305 --> 04:08.080
Yeah, that way we know
if we're doing something wrong.

04:08.307 --> 04:10.824
Okay, A) I rarely
do anything wrong.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.643
And B) when I do,
I don't want to know about it.

04:13.737 --> 04:15.829
And what is this "on the truck"?

04:15.998 --> 04:17.330
I mean,
"On the truck, I do this,"

04:17.483 --> 04:18.982
and, "On the truck, I do that."

04:19.075 --> 04:20.667
Does it look like
we're on a damn truck?

04:20.836 --> 04:22.836
Well, I like the changes.

04:22.988 --> 04:24.337
Well, of course you do.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.080
That's because
you're looking at him

04:26.100 --> 04:28.675
through the rose-colored glasses
of a new relationship.

04:28.827 --> 04:30.251
Randi. Randi, Randi, Randi.

04:30.387 --> 04:34.088
I'm a 40-year-old woman, not
some lovesick middle schooler.

04:34.108 --> 04:36.758
Come on,
you never complain about him.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.185
I complain about Carter
to Carter.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.445
It's healthy to recognize

04:40.597 --> 04:42.522
the person you're dating
isn't perfect.

04:42.674 --> 04:44.432
In fact, it makes
your relationship stronger.

04:44.451 --> 04:45.842
I know he's not perfect.

04:45.935 --> 04:49.346
Okay, then name one thing
you don't like about him.

04:49.364 --> 04:50.580
(inhales)

04:53.794 --> 04:56.295
He made me wait 39 years
to meet him.

04:57.372 --> 04:59.706
Okay. You know what?
I'm gonna go clean the bathroom,

04:59.800 --> 05:02.175
because that's less gross
than what you just said.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.453
(groans)

05:05.472 --> 05:06.696
I'm so full.

05:06.790 --> 05:08.532
I didn't need the triple-triple.

05:08.550 --> 05:10.809
-Then why'd you do it?
-I don't know.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.036
Why did I eat
a chimichanga for breakfast?

05:13.129 --> 05:15.296
Why did I have
pizza in bed last night?

05:15.432 --> 05:16.464
Pizza in bed?

05:16.633 --> 05:18.725
I call it my night za.

05:18.877 --> 05:21.044
(groans)
I'm on a downward spiral.

05:21.137 --> 05:22.487
I can't even remember
the last time I ate

05:22.639 --> 05:24.214
anything green
that wasn't a gummy worm.

05:24.232 --> 05:25.882
You got gummy worms?
You holding out on me?

05:25.975 --> 05:28.735
No, no more bad food.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.887
In fact,
I'm gonna start a juice cleanse.

05:30.980 --> 05:32.556
Tomorrow. Maybe Friday.

05:32.574 --> 05:34.391
No, no, tomorrow.

05:34.484 --> 05:35.316
(laughs)

05:35.336 --> 05:37.151
Hey, you got to be kidding me.

05:37.171 --> 05:40.397
There is no way that you
can survive a juice cleanse.

05:40.490 --> 05:41.731
Could do it better than you.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.508
You down sugar like it's heroin.

05:43.735 --> 05:45.010
-Nuh-uh.
-Empty your pockets.

05:45.237 --> 05:47.262
I don't have to prove
anything to you.

05:47.997 --> 05:49.681
Oh, get out of there!

05:52.411 --> 05:56.538
Did you just eat pocket candy
off a dirty bar floor?

05:56.673 --> 05:58.231
No.

06:01.269 --> 06:03.236
I may have a problem.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.257
Why don't you
do the cleanse with me?

06:07.275 --> 06:09.034
Three days, starting tomorrow.

06:09.185 --> 06:10.110
Maybe Friday.

06:10.262 --> 06:11.870
No, no, tomorrow.

06:12.097 --> 06:14.114
All right,
but let's make it interesting.

06:14.266 --> 06:16.449
Whoever breaks
has to clean the deep fryer

06:16.602 --> 06:19.936
and handle all vomit-related
incidents for the next month.

06:19.955 --> 06:23.423
Ooh, throwing VRIs into the mix.
You're on.

06:25.368 --> 06:26.943
I'm gonna order a pizza.
Do you want anything?

06:26.962 --> 06:29.054
Ooh, see if they can put
gummy worms on it.

06:29.798 --> 06:31.932
♪ ♪

06:33.060 --> 06:35.060
Welcome to the Monoi Beach
Resort and Spa--

06:35.287 --> 06:37.229
the hotel for lovers.

06:40.383 --> 06:41.808
Maybe this wasn't a good idea.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.885
Preston cheated on you.

06:43.979 --> 06:47.197
Living well is the best revenge.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.242
Here's our confirmation.

06:50.393 --> 06:51.635
Thank you.

06:52.395 --> 06:54.137
Would you like to use
the credit card on file

06:54.156 --> 06:55.639
for incidentals and amenities?

06:55.732 --> 06:58.333
Preston Brooks, ending in 8564?

07:00.087 --> 07:03.480
Preston, honey,
does that work for you?

07:03.573 --> 07:05.649
Most certainly, my dear.

07:05.817 --> 07:07.426
Pip-pip.

07:09.430 --> 07:10.762
You know what?

07:10.914 --> 07:13.915
We'd like to upgrade
to one of your luxury suites.

07:15.010 --> 07:19.438
Blimey, that'll be great for all
the hot, heterosexual relations

07:19.665 --> 07:21.565
we're going to have.

07:22.501 --> 07:24.501
Let me just get you your keys.

07:24.519 --> 07:25.944
British?

07:26.095 --> 07:30.157
If I have to be straight,
I get to be British.

07:32.027 --> 07:33.510
Where do you get
the delicious candy

07:33.528 --> 07:35.345
in the machines
by the front door?

07:35.438 --> 07:37.247
Oh, those are cat treats.

07:38.125 --> 07:38.974
I know.

07:39.034 --> 07:41.084
I want to get some for my cats.

07:42.020 --> 07:43.369
You don't have a cat, do you?

07:43.464 --> 07:44.704
I might.

07:45.615 --> 07:48.633
All right, we'll have those
ready for you tomorrow at 9:00.

07:48.860 --> 07:50.618
Have a "meowtastic" day.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.545
Wait. What are we having ready
tomorrow at 9:00?

07:52.639 --> 07:54.139
-Cupcakes.
-How many?

07:54.366 --> 07:55.882
400.

07:56.034 --> 07:57.291
400 of Phil's cupcakes,
without Phil?

07:57.385 --> 07:58.626
Are you crazy?!

07:58.720 --> 08:00.645
I assumed you took orders
like this all the time.

08:00.797 --> 08:03.056
No! Our record is 82.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.375
And that was muffins--
no frosting.

08:05.393 --> 08:06.801
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

08:06.820 --> 08:07.986
Good news.

08:08.213 --> 08:10.137
Matthew Purry does not
have a bladder infection.

08:10.232 --> 08:12.139
He's just pee shy.

08:12.234 --> 08:14.234
Well, more good news--
thanks to this guy,

08:14.386 --> 08:17.478
we get to stay up
and make 400 cupcakes overnight.

08:17.498 --> 08:18.738
What?

08:18.832 --> 08:20.724
400 of Phil's cupcakes,
without Phil?

08:20.742 --> 08:22.125
Are you crazy?!

08:27.156 --> 08:28.915
Okay, nobody panic.

Though he did
cut someone's ear off,

08:44.082 --> 08:45.506
so it may have been
for the best.

08:45.642 --> 08:47.250
And what if the cupcakes
are for something important,

08:47.269 --> 08:49.343
like a fundraiser
for puppies or orphans?

08:49.363 --> 08:50.920
Puppies don't eat cupcakes,

08:50.939 --> 08:52.589

used to disappointment.

it makes 24 cupcakes.

10:00.826 --> 10:02.826

10:02.844 --> 10:04.585
I say we make
one batch at a time,

10:04.605 --> 10:06.679

while those are baking.

10:06.832 --> 10:08.089
No, no, that'll take too long.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.441
We should do
one giant batch of batter

and mixing once.

Oh, frick the frickin' truck!

17:18.279 --> 17:19.612
Frick it straight to hell!

17:20.373 --> 17:23.616
And you're not helping.
You're trying to take over.

17:23.768 --> 17:24.876
And I keep letting you

17:25.027 --> 17:26.377
'cause I'm wearing glasses
made of roses.

17:26.529 --> 17:27.953
Now you're not even
making sense.

17:28.106 --> 17:29.363
Oh, you want me to make sense?
I'll make sense.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.457
I'm tired of you telling me
what to do all day.

17:31.609 --> 17:33.793
I'm not telling you what to do.
I was offering suggestions.

17:33.961 --> 17:35.369
Well, you have to stop it,

17:35.463 --> 17:36.629
because my love for you
is making me

17:36.781 --> 17:37.963
agree to do stupid things!

17:38.116 --> 17:39.223
That's not my fault.
And you're over-frosting

17:39.375 --> 17:40.616
-that cupcake.
-Oh, this one?

17:40.709 --> 17:41.801
This one right here?

17:41.895 --> 17:44.270
Oh!

17:48.384 --> 17:50.551
-(Carter gasps)
-RANDI: Ooh!

17:50.719 --> 17:52.111
(Max laughing)

17:55.466 --> 17:57.200
-MAX: Oh, no!
-(Carter laughing)

17:59.395 --> 18:02.563
Oh. Oh, you think it's funny?
You think that's funny?

18:02.582 --> 18:04.415
(Kat gasps)

18:04.584 --> 18:05.975
CARTER:
Mmm.

18:06.068 --> 18:08.160
-You lose. You lose.
-Hey, it doesn't count!

18:08.313 --> 18:09.662
-It doesn't count!
-MAX: It does count!

18:09.814 --> 18:11.756
-It total... (grunts)
-Oh!

18:11.983 --> 18:14.241
-(laughs)
-Oh, is that funny?

18:14.260 --> 18:17.345
-RANDI: Oh! (shrieks)
-Oh!

18:18.172 --> 18:21.015
(all laughing, grunting)

18:23.845 --> 18:25.995
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Okay, you guys,

18:26.013 --> 18:27.921
stop wasting the damn cupcakes,

18:27.941 --> 18:29.682
or we're gonna be here
all night!

18:29.834 --> 18:31.091
(panting)

18:31.111 --> 18:34.070
(Randi screams)

18:35.431 --> 18:36.856
(screams)

18:36.932 --> 18:39.242
(grunting, laughing)

18:41.529 --> 18:42.620
-Thanks.
-Oh.

18:42.771 --> 18:44.122
-You got quite the arm on you.
-(chuckles)

18:44.273 --> 18:46.015
That was nothing.
You should've seen me

18:46.033 --> 18:48.751
in the summer camp spaghetti war
of '95.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.129
Kat, I'm sorry.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.113
I was supposed to be helping you
while Phil was gone,

18:53.207 --> 18:55.115
but I just made things
more stressful.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.209
Yeah, you-you did.

18:57.362 --> 18:59.804
You may not know this
about me yet, but I get excited

18:59.955 --> 19:01.139
about organization
and efficiency.

19:01.366 --> 19:04.033
Is that why you alphabetized
all my condiments?

19:04.051 --> 19:06.051
It was a zoo in there.
Soy sauce next to mayo?

19:06.128 --> 19:07.370
-What are we doing?
-(chuckles softly)

19:07.388 --> 19:09.147
I've always been like this.

19:09.374 --> 19:11.374
I used to rearrange
my sister's dollhouses

19:11.392 --> 19:13.317
-so Barbie
could focus on her work.
-(chuckles)

19:13.544 --> 19:15.969
My mom got rid of my dollhouse
when she found Barbie and Ken

19:15.989 --> 19:18.714
in the throes
of smooth-genitaled passion.

19:18.733 --> 19:19.732
(chuckles)

19:19.884 --> 19:20.716
Listen, um,

19:20.809 --> 19:22.401
you know,
I should apologize, too.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.737
For smashing a cupcake
in my face?

19:24.889 --> 19:26.739
Don't. It was delicious.

19:26.891 --> 19:29.483
(chuckles) Well, that,
and I should have just told you

19:29.502 --> 19:31.394
you were bugging me,
but I just...

19:31.412 --> 19:32.411
I don't like to rock the boat.

19:32.563 --> 19:33.913
You got to rock the boat
sometimes,

19:34.065 --> 19:35.322
or it'll fill up with resentment

19:35.341 --> 19:36.507
and sink to the bottom
of the ocean.

19:36.659 --> 19:39.343
-I'm just not used to fighting.
-Really?

19:39.495 --> 19:40.661
Well, I never saw
my parents fight.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.904
I didn't have any siblings.

19:41.997 --> 19:43.514
Even my imaginary friend

19:43.741 --> 19:45.408
worked more
in passive-aggressiveness.

19:45.576 --> 19:46.909
She'd disappear
for weeks at a time

19:47.044 --> 19:48.502
without so much as a note.

19:48.596 --> 19:50.246
Well, my family
loved to throw down,

19:50.339 --> 19:53.024
and if you were left out,
you wondered what you did wrong.

19:53.175 --> 19:56.027
By the way,
this was barely a fight.

19:56.178 --> 19:57.753
But even when we have
bigger ones,

19:57.772 --> 19:58.921
we'll be fine.

19:58.940 --> 20:01.899
Because our "relation-ship"
is solid.

20:02.126 --> 20:02.942
Pun intended?

20:03.036 --> 20:04.994
-You know it.
-(chuckling)

20:07.189 --> 20:08.689
All right, we should
probably get back downstairs.

20:08.783 --> 20:10.115
In a minute.

20:10.210 --> 20:12.952
Oh, is it payday already?

20:13.046 --> 20:14.712
(chuckles)

20:14.863 --> 20:17.965
-Mmm. (laughs)
-Sweet.

20:22.037 --> 20:24.405
Hey, we got a review
for the cupcakes.

20:24.407 --> 20:25.948
-Ooh, what did they say?
-Uh...

20:25.967 --> 20:27.558
"Great cupcakes. Nice job."

20:27.710 --> 20:31.103
-That's it?
-I like it. It's efficient.

20:32.381 --> 20:33.397
We're back!

20:33.549 --> 20:35.066
-Hey.
-Hey.
-Hey, welcome back.

20:35.293 --> 20:37.401
And we brought gifties.

20:37.628 --> 20:39.295
Ooh, I love presents.

20:39.313 --> 20:41.313
I picked him out just for you.

20:41.466 --> 20:43.407
-His name is Kevin.
-Oh.

20:43.634 --> 20:45.651
Hey, Kevin.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.470
A hat for you.

20:47.488 --> 20:48.487
Ooh, thank you.

20:48.581 --> 20:51.624
-And chocolates for you.
-Ooh, thanks.

20:53.661 --> 20:55.569
Phil, I'm so glad you're back.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.830
Now I can get back
on my truck alone.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.331
Oh, I'm so glad
you're back, too.

20:59.425 --> 21:01.908
Although I have come around
to some of Oscar's changes.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.427
Moving the straws was brilliant.

21:03.654 --> 21:05.763
Really? 'Cause I had a few more
ideas I think could really help.

21:05.914 --> 21:07.080
-No!
-No!
