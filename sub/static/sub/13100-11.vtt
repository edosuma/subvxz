WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:04.125
[intense music]

00:14.250 --> 00:16.083
(John)
'Are those the last
of the Night Watch?'

00:16.167 --> 00:17.792
Well, it's the last batch
we could find.

00:17.875 --> 00:19.792
Garibaldi's still trying
to track down the rest.

00:19.875 --> 00:22.167
The others are civilians heading
for Earth, Mars in colonies

00:22.250 --> 00:23.875
and Proxima in Orion.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
- Oh, what happened to you?
- Uh.

00:27.083 --> 00:29.083
I fractured my elbow and wrist
when we went hand-to-hand

00:29.167 --> 00:30.750
when the marines
tried to board us.

00:30.833 --> 00:32.583
I figured I could get by
with just the bandages.

00:32.667 --> 00:34.833
But doc wants me in a cast
just to be sure.

00:34.917 --> 00:37.250
- That's no big deal.
- How is it out there?

00:37.333 --> 00:40.500
It's quiet.
And they're all pretty stunned.

00:40.583 --> 00:42.958
It's not every day
that we secede from Earth.

00:43.042 --> 00:44.292
Mostly they're unhappy
about having

00:44.375 --> 00:45.708
all the com channels shut down.

00:45.792 --> 00:47.625
We can't put
StellarCom back online

00:47.708 --> 00:50.625
until we've added
some insurance.

00:50.708 --> 00:52.625
Now, the computer system
that runs this place

00:52.708 --> 00:54.667
was installed by Earth Central.

00:54.750 --> 00:55.958
They have all the access codes.

00:56.042 --> 00:57.750
So once we open up
all the com channels

00:57.833 --> 01:00.333
they can send a message out
to override the system

01:00.417 --> 01:03.625
erase our passwords
and lock us out. Cute.

01:03.708 --> 01:05.792
I mean, they could shut down
the defense grid, life support.

01:05.875 --> 01:07.833
No problem, I've got
the access codes locked away.

01:07.917 --> 01:09.375
'It shouldn't be
too much trouble'

01:09.458 --> 01:11.917
to go in
and change the passwords.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.167
So how much longer are you
going to stay out of uniform?

01:15.250 --> 01:16.625
Until this is over.

01:16.708 --> 01:18.292
That could be a long time.

01:18.375 --> 01:19.792
As long as we are on our own

01:19.875 --> 01:23.000
I can't justify
wearing an Earth force uniform.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.292
My hypocrisy only goes so far.

01:25.375 --> 01:26.875
What about later?

01:28.417 --> 01:31.458
Well, um. I'll wear it then.

01:31.542 --> 01:33.417
But that's the last time.

01:33.500 --> 01:35.542
Now, if you need me..

01:35.625 --> 01:37.500
...I'll be out
making the rounds.

01:37.583 --> 01:39.708
Are you sure that's a good idea?

01:39.792 --> 01:41.667
We have to reassure everyone

01:41.750 --> 01:43.583
that we are in control
of the situation.

01:43.667 --> 01:45.667
We can't do that
hiding in our offices.

01:45.750 --> 01:48.667
I still think you should have
an armed escort.

01:48.750 --> 01:51.750
That kind of defeats
the purpose, Mr. Garibaldi.

01:51.833 --> 01:54.542
I can take care of myself.

01:54.625 --> 01:57.417
Captain Sheridan has asked me
to convey his thanks

01:57.500 --> 01:59.833
for helping save this place.

01:59.917 --> 02:03.375
The trial ahead of us
will be long and difficult.

02:03.458 --> 02:06.208
But our first step
has been an honorable one.

02:06.292 --> 02:08.583
When you return to your ships,
tell your captains

02:08.667 --> 02:11.500
that history will remember them
with reverence.

02:22.833 --> 02:25.292
Delenn,
fleet Captain Lenann has asked

02:25.375 --> 02:27.833
if he may come aboard
for a tour of the station.

02:27.917 --> 02:30.167
Of course.
I'll meet him personally.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.417
Lennier,
you still haven't told me

02:32.500 --> 02:35.208
what you think of all this.

02:35.292 --> 02:37.417
Opinion doesn't enter into it.

02:37.500 --> 02:39.542
What is, is.

02:39.625 --> 02:41.583
Prophecy said one day
we would unite

02:41.667 --> 02:45.042
with the other half of our soul
in a war with the ancient enemy.

02:45.125 --> 02:46.333
This we have done.

02:46.417 --> 02:49.583
Prophecy is a poor guide
to the future.

02:49.667 --> 02:53.250
You only understand it when
the event's already upon you.

02:53.333 --> 02:56.958
And not all
of the prophecies are good ones.

02:57.042 --> 03:00.000
There's darkness and fire
still ahead of us.

03:00.083 --> 03:04.167
There are no guarantees
that any of us will survive it.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.375
[indistinct chattering]

03:13.500 --> 03:16.042
[intense music]

03:26.000 --> 03:30.833
(Ivanova)
The Babylon project was
our last, best hope for peace.

03:34.292 --> 03:36.083
It failed.

03:36.167 --> 03:38.958
[dramatic music]

03:51.125 --> 03:52.917
But in the year
of the Shadow War

03:53.000 --> 03:55.125
it became something greater

03:55.208 --> 03:58.125
our last best hope
for victory.

04:03.375 --> 04:05.792
The year is 2260.

04:05.875 --> 04:08.333
The place, Babylon 5.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.708
[theme music]

04:41.917 --> 04:44.167
[music continues]

04:54.125 --> 04:56.417
[indistinct chatter]

05:00.250 --> 05:02.792
[intense music]

05:05.375 --> 05:06.875
I told you to wait.

05:06.958 --> 05:08.542
I had a clear shot.

05:08.625 --> 05:10.625
You had nothing.

05:10.708 --> 05:12.500
You take him down,
he's a martyr.

05:12.583 --> 05:16.875
Five hundred men will stand up
where he fell.

05:16.958 --> 05:19.542
Now, we do this by the numbers.

05:19.625 --> 05:21.708
Or not at all.

05:21.792 --> 05:23.542
Don't worry.

05:23.625 --> 05:25.833
Before this is over.

05:25.917 --> 05:28.333
We'll have our pound of flesh.

05:31.042 --> 05:33.333
Well, Marcus, welcome back.

05:33.417 --> 05:34.667
Delenn.

05:34.750 --> 05:35.750
Lennier.

05:35.833 --> 05:36.875
Any news?

05:36.958 --> 05:38.667
I think we are safe for a while.

05:38.750 --> 05:42.042
Your government will think twice
before engaging a Minbari fleet.

05:42.125 --> 05:43.583
They're not my government.

05:43.667 --> 05:45.667
Back on the colony,
Earth was just a place

05:45.750 --> 05:48.958
that sent us books and vids
and took 30% of our income.

05:49.042 --> 05:51.083
Should have given them
the boot years ago.

05:51.167 --> 05:52.708
Now we can make a fresh start.

05:52.792 --> 05:56.833
Yes. Which is why I decided
to call for the Nafak'cha.

05:58.083 --> 06:00.042
This may not be a good time.

06:00.125 --> 06:02.583
The rebirth ceremony
commemorates a great change

06:02.667 --> 06:05.917
that is coming,
or a great change that is here.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
We stand between both.

06:08.083 --> 06:10.208
Why is this
not an appropriate time?

06:10.292 --> 06:12.167
Your people need to heal.

06:12.250 --> 06:13.833
All of us here need to heal.

06:13.917 --> 06:15.917
The ceremony will help.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.875
I just think
everyone's going to be busy

06:17.958 --> 06:20.792
with ceremonies
of their own for a while.

06:20.875 --> 06:22.917
(John)
In breaking away from Earth

06:23.000 --> 06:25.958
we have begun a difficult
and uncertain journey.

06:26.042 --> 06:28.875
And none of us can see its end.

06:28.958 --> 06:31.625
But our cause
remains a just one.

06:33.042 --> 06:37.417
That truth honors and
sanctifies our fallen comrades

06:37.500 --> 06:40.250
'who have made
the ultimate sacrifice.'

06:40.333 --> 06:42.125
'So that we might
carry on the work'

06:42.208 --> 06:44.500
'that is ahead of us.'

06:44.583 --> 06:46.667
We are gathered here today..

06:48.375 --> 06:50.292
...to honor their memory

06:50.375 --> 06:52.292
and their names.

06:52.375 --> 06:53.792
About-face.

06:55.417 --> 06:56.500
Hamilton.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.333
Rodriguez.

06:58.417 --> 07:00.083
Spinelli.

07:00.167 --> 07:01.833
'Singh.'

07:01.917 --> 07:03.583
'Osterman.'

07:03.667 --> 07:05.375
'Massie.'

07:05.458 --> 07:06.833
'Cooper.'

07:06.917 --> 07:08.500
'Kim.'

07:08.583 --> 07:10.000
Indari.

07:10.083 --> 07:11.833
Nagashima.

07:11.917 --> 07:13.167
Lietz.

07:13.250 --> 07:14.583
Mankowski.

07:14.667 --> 07:16.750
From the stars we came.

07:16.833 --> 07:18.833
To the stars we return.

07:18.917 --> 07:21.833
From now until the end of time.

07:21.917 --> 07:25.917
We therefore commit these bodies
to the deep.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.958
[instrumental music]

07:35.750 --> 07:37.375
[indistinct chatter]

07:39.292 --> 07:40.542
Uh.

07:40.625 --> 07:42.000
Will you have a drink,
Lord Refa?

07:42.083 --> 07:43.458
Yes, thank you.

07:45.042 --> 07:47.500
I'm sure
it was a tiring journey.

07:47.583 --> 07:49.167
Yes, it was.

07:49.250 --> 07:50.542
Now, what was so important

07:50.625 --> 07:53.208
that you felt
you had to drag me out here

07:53.292 --> 07:55.458
instead of coming
to Centauri Prime?

07:55.542 --> 07:58.542
Well, I have been going there
quite a bit lately.

07:58.625 --> 08:01.958
I think it is good for you to
come to me from time to time.

08:02.042 --> 08:03.625
Hmm?

08:03.708 --> 08:08.167
Now, I have been studying these
reports from the front lines.

08:08.250 --> 08:11.917
You will note the plural form,
lines.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.583
Is there anyone
along our border

08:13.667 --> 08:16.542
with whom we are
not currently at war?

08:16.625 --> 08:18.917
We need the room to expand.

08:20.208 --> 08:23.375
Only an idiot fights
a war on two fronts.

08:23.458 --> 08:26.250
Only the heir to the throne
of the kingdom of idiots

08:26.333 --> 08:29.417
would fight
a war on 12 fronts.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.792
We can handle it.

08:31.875 --> 08:34.333
Our resources
are greater than you think.

08:34.417 --> 08:36.375
- Oh.
- Mm.

08:36.458 --> 08:40.375
You mean your recent alliance
with Mr. Morden, yes?

08:40.458 --> 08:42.417
I don't know
what you're talking about.

08:42.500 --> 08:43.958
[clicking tongue]

08:44.583 --> 08:45.917
[sighs]

08:48.500 --> 08:51.792
We asked Lord Refa
to secure the planet for us.

08:56.583 --> 09:00.458
I have gotten into the habit
of recording important meetings.

09:00.542 --> 09:03.000
One never knows
when an inconvenient truth

09:03.083 --> 09:06.292
will fall between
the cracks and vanish.

09:06.375 --> 09:09.875
Mr. Morden
and his associates worry me.

09:09.958 --> 09:11.333
After the Narns were defeated

09:11.417 --> 09:14.333
I took steps to put some
distance between us.

09:15.375 --> 09:16.958
Refa.

09:17.042 --> 09:19.708
I have the feeling
that he and his associates

09:19.792 --> 09:21.958
are carving a great, dark hole

09:22.042 --> 09:23.875
in the middle of the universe.

09:23.958 --> 09:26.125
And when they go down.

09:26.208 --> 09:28.333
Anyone nearby will go with them.

09:28.417 --> 09:30.708
That will not happen.

09:30.792 --> 09:32.833
You don't appreciate
their strength.

09:32.917 --> 09:35.500
Oh, I appreciate their strength,
alright.

09:35.583 --> 09:39.458
And that is why this
unfocused aggression worries me.

09:39.542 --> 09:40.917
By drawing our forces

09:41.000 --> 09:42.750
into a dozen smaller wars

09:42.833 --> 09:46.000
you have effectively weakened
our main line of defense.

09:46.083 --> 09:47.958
Should they turn
an eye to Centauri Prime.

09:48.042 --> 09:50.458
- They will not do that.
- No, they will not.

09:50.542 --> 09:53.167
Because you are going
to take steps to prevent it.

09:53.250 --> 09:55.833
And you will start by
breaking off your relationship

09:55.917 --> 09:57.333
with Mr. Morden.

09:57.417 --> 09:59.583
[laughing]

10:00.500 --> 10:02.417
Oh, Londo.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.792
You are a fool.

10:04.875 --> 10:09.583
You walked away from the
greatest power I have ever seen.

10:09.667 --> 10:12.500
And now you expect me
to do the same?

10:12.583 --> 10:16.292
They are the key to my
eventual rise to the throne.

10:17.458 --> 10:19.583
Why would I abandon them?

10:19.667 --> 10:22.458
Because I have asked you.

10:22.542 --> 10:24.458
And because
your loyalty to our people

10:24.542 --> 10:26.750
should be greater
than your ambition.

10:28.542 --> 10:31.375
And because
I have poisoned your drink.

10:34.542 --> 10:35.875
Yes.

10:35.958 --> 10:39.708
And it is
a very interesting poison.

10:39.792 --> 10:42.208
It comes in two parts.

10:42.292 --> 10:43.917
Both are harmless on their own.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.833
But when combined, quite lethal.

10:47.917 --> 10:50.292
The first
settles into the bloodstream

10:50.375 --> 10:52.958
and the intestinal walls.

10:53.042 --> 10:55.083
It stays there for years.

10:55.167 --> 10:59.375
Silent, dormant, waiting.

10:59.458 --> 11:01.792
When the other half
of the poison enters the body

11:01.875 --> 11:05.167
the two meet,
have a little party

11:05.250 --> 11:07.042
in your cardiovascular system

11:07.125 --> 11:11.458
and suddenly you are quite dead.

11:13.500 --> 11:17.458
Your drink contained
the first half of the poison.

11:17.542 --> 11:19.417
Why?

11:19.500 --> 11:21.167
Why did you do this?

11:21.250 --> 11:23.750
To guarantee your cooperation.

11:25.667 --> 11:30.042
And because, sooner or later,
you would do it to me.

11:31.667 --> 11:34.750
Yes, we're returning
to the old ways, Refa.

11:34.833 --> 11:37.917
And poison was always
the instrument of choice

11:38.000 --> 11:39.292
in the old republic.

11:39.375 --> 11:42.417
Being something
of a sentimentalist

11:42.500 --> 11:45.583
I got here first.

11:45.667 --> 11:47.917
What do you want me to do?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.625
You have encouraged
that fool Cartagia

11:50.708 --> 11:53.542
to attack worlds
that have no value to us.

11:53.625 --> 11:56.292
You will now
encourage him otherwise.

11:56.375 --> 12:00.333
You will bolster our lines of
defense around Centauri Prime.

12:00.417 --> 12:03.458
And you will have nothing more
to do with Mr. Morden.

12:04.458 --> 12:06.625
'If you do not comply..'

12:06.708 --> 12:09.958
...one of my agents
in the Royal Palace

12:10.042 --> 12:13.208
will introduce you to
the second half of the poison.

12:16.958 --> 12:19.667
To your health, Lord Refa.

12:21.250 --> 12:22.292
[beeping]

12:22.375 --> 12:24.792
Okay, I've accessed
the command codes.

12:24.875 --> 12:27.167
We're all set. Go ahead.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.708
This is
Captain John J. Sheridan.

12:34.417 --> 12:37.000

12:37.083 --> 12:38.542
This is commander Susan Ivanova.

12:38.625 --> 12:41.208
Serial number Z48M27-Epsilon.

12:41.292 --> 12:43.167
Security code, Griffin.

12:43.250 --> 12:45.250
(Garibaldi)
'This is chief warrant officer
Michael Garibaldi.'

12:45.333 --> 12:48.125
Serial number V17L98.

12:49.750 --> 12:51.833

'Authorizations confirmed.'

12:51.917 --> 12:53.083
'Orders?'

12:53.167 --> 12:55.750
Alright, list
all command level passwords.

12:55.833 --> 12:58.708
Replace all entries with new
passwords, then restart system.

13:00.375 --> 13:02.833
Captain,
if this is not a good time..

13:02.917 --> 13:04.292
No, no, no, it's fine.

13:04.375 --> 13:06.625
Uh, they can
take care of the rest.

13:10.750 --> 13:12.208
[clearing throat]

13:14.125 --> 13:15.875
Peek-a-boo?

13:15.958 --> 13:17.625
Would you have guessed it?

13:18.542 --> 13:20.333
[chuckles]

13:20.417 --> 13:22.208
Uh, a rebirth ceremony?

13:22.292 --> 13:25.750
Yes, I demonstrated
a small part of it two years ago

13:25.833 --> 13:27.833
in an exchange
of religious ritual.

13:27.917 --> 13:30.083
Now I think
we could benefit from all of it.

13:30.167 --> 13:31.417
Who are you inviting?

13:31.500 --> 13:33.917
You, Ivanova

13:34.000 --> 13:35.625
Mr. Garibaldi, Dr. Franklin

13:35.708 --> 13:38.958
several in what's left of the
League of Non-Aligned Worlds.

13:39.042 --> 13:41.042
G'Kar, Ambassador Mollari.

13:41.125 --> 13:42.208
Londo?

13:42.292 --> 13:43.833
With everything
that's been going on

13:43.917 --> 13:46.125
he's the last person I'd invite
to something like this.

13:46.208 --> 13:48.583
Which is why
he was the first one

13:48.667 --> 13:51.458
I decided must be invited.

13:51.542 --> 13:54.042
We have gone
through so much pain, John.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.750
If we do not put it behind us

13:55.833 --> 13:59.208
if we are not born
into new possibilities

13:59.292 --> 14:01.500
it will surely destroy us.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.417
(Boggs)
'What about people
who just got in carrying orders'

14:05.500 --> 14:08.750
from the Night Watch
office back home?

14:08.833 --> 14:10.333
We want everyone on the watch

14:10.417 --> 14:12.458
who's managed to go undetected

14:12.542 --> 14:16.167
to keep a low profile,
except for us.

14:16.250 --> 14:18.958
We've been authorized
to proceed.

14:19.042 --> 14:24.167
For now, Sheridan is not
the primary target.

14:24.250 --> 14:26.250
Damn Minbari.

14:26.333 --> 14:29.917
We nearly had Sheridan till
those war cruisers showed up.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.583
Can't do anything
until they're gone.

14:31.667 --> 14:33.250
Exactly.

14:33.333 --> 14:35.250
So that's our target.

14:35.333 --> 14:39.458
Ambassador Delenn is walking
a tightrope back home.

14:39.542 --> 14:43.458
She got those ships here through
sheer force of personality.

14:43.542 --> 14:46.292
They think that she's
the second coming or something.

14:47.875 --> 14:49.625
You take that away

14:49.708 --> 14:52.375
and their support will fade.

14:52.458 --> 14:55.708
The Minbari warships
will vanish.

14:55.792 --> 14:59.125
Our forces can come in
and finish the job.

14:59.208 --> 15:02.167
Minbari are funny
about their leaders.

15:02.250 --> 15:05.917
We kill Delenn, they
might take it kind of personal.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.292
(Boggs)
'Don't worry.
We've got that angle covered.'

15:09.375 --> 15:13.208
'We'll make it look like
it was Sheridan's fault.'

15:13.292 --> 15:16.333
'That way he loses
on both sides.'

15:17.708 --> 15:19.458
During the war..

15:21.250 --> 15:23.958
...I once took seven days
to kill a Minbari.

15:25.417 --> 15:29.542
First you tie off the fingers
one at a time.

15:29.625 --> 15:32.875
Then you slice off the fingers.

15:32.958 --> 15:34.375
And the feet.

15:35.750 --> 15:37.375
The hands.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.667
The arms.

15:40.750 --> 15:42.375
The legs.

15:44.167 --> 15:46.125
You should have seen it.

15:46.208 --> 15:48.792
Don't worry.
We will.

16:27.208 --> 16:29.625
I thought you might be here.

16:29.708 --> 16:31.333
Of course.

16:31.417 --> 16:33.958
This is where my contacts
come see me.

16:34.042 --> 16:36.208
Doesn't look like much,
but this place is a gold mine

16:36.292 --> 16:40.542
for information.
Mine, theirs.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.583
'Some kind of syndicate,
I think.'

16:42.667 --> 16:43.958
But we've come to an agreement.

16:44.042 --> 16:46.917
I don't bother them,
they don't bother me.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.375
So, what can I do for you?

16:49.458 --> 16:52.667
I thought you would be
preparing for the ceremony.

16:52.750 --> 16:55.125
Yeah, well,
I thought I'd opt out, actually.

16:55.208 --> 16:56.708
There's so much to do.

16:56.792 --> 16:59.958
You've been nervous about this
ever since I mentioned it.

17:00.042 --> 17:01.958
What are you afraid of?

17:02.042 --> 17:04.917
Nothing.
Well, spiders.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.500
Marcus, the rebirth ceremony

17:07.583 --> 17:09.625
was part of your training
on Minbari.

17:09.708 --> 17:11.208
I missed it. Overslept.

17:11.292 --> 17:13.000
It lasts all day.

17:13.083 --> 17:14.708
Oh, that's right.
I was ill.

17:14.792 --> 17:17.417
'Wanted to go. Couldn't.'

17:17.500 --> 17:18.667
Same as now.

17:18.750 --> 17:21.500
Love to, can't really.
Next time.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.417
Ah, someone
I've been waiting for.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.750
We'll talk about this again,
Marcus.

17:29.417 --> 17:31.167
If you'll excuse me.

17:35.917 --> 17:38.667
There, finished inputting
the command codes.

17:38.750 --> 17:42.375
Now we just
reset the computer system

17:42.458 --> 17:43.625
and once it comes back online

17:43.708 --> 17:46.333
it should be operating
under the new passwords.

17:46.417 --> 17:48.625

I've broken something.

17:59.250 --> 18:01.583
They'll be fine.
I've done this before.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.833

18:28.375 --> 18:30.583
- Stop.
- Garibaldi..

they tried to install

18:32.000 --> 18:33.167
artificial intelligence
subroutine

18:33.250 --> 18:34.833
when the station
went operational.

18:34.917 --> 18:37.667
They shut it down right away
because it didn't work right.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.167
Must've come back online
when the system rebooted.

'Are you two
easily offended or what?'

18:47.792 --> 18:49.708
Could you tell me
a little more about

18:49.792 --> 18:53.708
what is involved
in this rebirth ceremony?

18:53.792 --> 18:58.042
Reflection, meditation
upon what has gone before.

18:58.125 --> 19:00.542
What is now,
and what is to come.

19:00.625 --> 19:03.708
for a moment,
I was thinking

19:03.792 --> 19:06.667
women, drinking, and debauchery.

19:06.750 --> 19:09.417
'I forgot
I was speaking to Minbari.'

19:09.500 --> 19:12.250
This buy you is a good time,
is it?

19:13.958 --> 19:15.042
What else?

19:15.125 --> 19:16.708
You must tell someone a secret

19:16.792 --> 19:19.250
that you have never told
anyone else before.

19:19.333 --> 19:21.000
And you must give away something

19:21.083 --> 19:23.208
that is of great value to you.

19:23.292 --> 19:27.542
Oh, sounds positively festive.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.750
It is time for us
to come together

19:29.833 --> 19:32.792
to restore that
which has been torn apart.

19:32.875 --> 19:35.000
And to heal the wounds
we have suffered.

19:35.083 --> 19:37.417
With everything
that has been going on.

19:37.500 --> 19:39.583
I'm surprised you invited me.

19:39.667 --> 19:42.958
In a matter of confessions,
meditation

19:43.042 --> 19:45.583
and the closing of past wounds,
ambassador

19:45.667 --> 19:49.375
you were at the top of my list.

19:49.458 --> 19:52.958
I am already attending
to my past, my present

19:53.042 --> 19:55.167
and what remains of my future.

19:55.250 --> 19:58.333
'I do not require
your assistance'

19:58.417 --> 20:00.958
'or your approval.'

20:01.042 --> 20:04.083
Enjoy your ceremony, Delenn.

20:04.167 --> 20:06.958
I intend to have other plans.

20:12.208 --> 20:14.208
Since we've begun working
with station security

20:14.292 --> 20:16.083
we have greater obligations.

20:16.167 --> 20:18.250
We need to prove our value
to Sheridan.

20:18.333 --> 20:20.458
So that we can retain our
position when the crisis ends.

20:20.542 --> 20:23.333
I'll try and stop by
for the closing ceremonies.

20:23.417 --> 20:25.875
What matters is everything
leading up to that point.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.917
Leaving behind the old,
preparing to be reborn.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
I've already been born once

20:30.083 --> 20:31.458
and quite sufficiently,
I think..

20:31.542 --> 20:33.375
Uh, I'm sorry,
but I'm simply too busy.

20:33.458 --> 20:35.708
Uh, good day to you,
Delenn, Mr. Lennier.

20:37.708 --> 20:40.292
Well, it was a good idea
while it lasted.

20:40.375 --> 20:42.167
It still is a good idea.

20:42.250 --> 20:44.375
We will hold the ceremony.

20:44.458 --> 20:47.750
If some choose not to attend,
the loss is theirs.

20:47.833 --> 20:50.458
Delenn, you asked me
to remind you about the ship.

20:50.542 --> 20:52.625
Oh, yes.
Of course.

20:52.708 --> 20:54.250
A captain
from one of our warships

20:54.333 --> 20:56.000
has asked for
a tour of the station.

20:56.083 --> 20:58.625
'It seems fair to let them see
what they have saved.'

20:58.708 --> 21:00.708
I will meet him
at the docking bay.

21:00.792 --> 21:02.792
Good, I will go with you.

21:02.875 --> 21:04.667
Marcus will accompany me.

21:04.750 --> 21:07.708
It will give us
a chance to talk.

21:10.917 --> 21:13.708

21:19.667 --> 21:23.167
I wish you would trust me enough
to talk to me, Marcus.

21:23.250 --> 21:25.375
Why are you so reluctant
to take part

21:25.458 --> 21:28.000
in the rebirth ceremony?

21:28.083 --> 21:31.000
You asked me
to give something up, Delenn.

21:31.083 --> 21:33.917
I don't have anything left.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.792
It's all gone.

21:39.583 --> 21:41.333
My brother was the last
of our family

21:41.417 --> 21:43.667
and he died
because of my stupidity.

21:45.333 --> 21:48.917
He warned me of the Shadows.
I didn't listen.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.042
And when they came,
I lost him, our home.

21:53.125 --> 21:56.042
The colony where we'd grown up.

21:56.125 --> 21:58.583
A woman I was quite fond of.

22:00.458 --> 22:02.458
I escaped with only
the clothes on my back

22:02.542 --> 22:04.417
went off in search
of these rangers

22:04.500 --> 22:07.583
that he'd been going on about..

22:07.667 --> 22:11.000
...because he believed in them
and in you.

22:12.958 --> 22:17.667
Everything I was,
everything I had

22:17.750 --> 22:19.875
all of it died that night.

22:21.583 --> 22:24.417
I don't have
anything left to give.

22:24.500 --> 22:28.417
Then that is exactly
what you must give up.

22:28.500 --> 22:31.792
Yes, you have lost much.

22:31.875 --> 22:36.000
Endured much,
sacrificed greatly.

22:36.083 --> 22:38.542
But you cling to the memory
of your sacrifices

22:38.625 --> 22:42.083
of all the things
you have lost, or left behind.

22:42.167 --> 22:43.583
They drag behind you

22:43.667 --> 22:46.167
like chains of your own making.

22:46.250 --> 22:49.083
'They can have a terrible power
over you, Marcus.'

22:49.167 --> 22:52.667
'The power of grief and loss'

22:52.750 --> 22:55.333
and regret.

22:55.417 --> 22:58.542
Yes, you have let go
of the people

22:58.625 --> 23:00.917
the places, the things.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.458
But you have not
let go of the pain.

23:04.542 --> 23:06.458
You have not forgiven yourself.

23:07.875 --> 23:09.417

24:15.583 --> 24:17.167
'You'll suck an orange.'

24:17.250 --> 24:19.167
'Would somebody
please fix this thing'

24:19.250 --> 24:21.625
'before I go out of my mind.'

24:21.708 --> 24:23.333
Michael, I just heard.

24:23.417 --> 24:24.958
Somebody grabbed
Ambassador Delenn

24:25.042 --> 24:27.167
and one of the Minbari captains.

24:31.875 --> 24:33.333
(Delenn)
He's hurt.

24:33.417 --> 24:36.208
You should attend to him,
or allow me to do so.

24:36.292 --> 24:39.458
If I were you, I'd be worried
about my own health right now.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.292
I have faced far worse than you.

24:44.167 --> 24:45.667
[door opens]

24:45.750 --> 24:47.167
Word's out.

24:48.292 --> 24:50.417
Got that monitor line scrambled?

24:50.500 --> 24:51.542
Good.

24:51.625 --> 24:53.708
Alright, people,
let's get ready.

24:56.167 --> 24:58.000
(Marcus)
It's my fault.

24:58.083 --> 24:59.500
I should
never have left her alone.

24:59.583 --> 25:01.042
Even for a minute.

25:01.125 --> 25:02.750
You couldn't have known.

25:02.833 --> 25:04.417
It's happening again.

25:04.500 --> 25:07.875
I don't listen,
I turn my back for two minutes.

25:07.958 --> 25:11.000
And somebody else
pays the price.

25:11.083 --> 25:12.500
Captain,
we've got someone on hold.

25:12.583 --> 25:13.958
It's about Delenn.

25:14.042 --> 25:15.875
Put him through,
and trace the call.

25:19.667 --> 25:22.042
- Boggs.
- Hello, chief.

25:22.125 --> 25:24.000
- Looking for me?
- Yeah.

25:24.083 --> 25:25.792
You and your
other Night Watch buddies.

25:25.875 --> 25:28.708
And you just gave me one
more good reason to find you.

25:28.792 --> 25:31.458
Where's Delenn?

25:31.542 --> 25:33.125
She's with us.

25:33.208 --> 25:36.750
'Also got a Minbari captain.
And one of his aides.'

25:36.833 --> 25:38.875
'And don't bother
tracking this call.'

25:38.958 --> 25:40.917
We've scrambled
the Babcom lines.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.250
What do you want?

25:42.333 --> 25:43.833
To put the station
back under Earth control

25:43.917 --> 25:46.375
and to kick out
the alien influence.

25:46.458 --> 25:48.292
Now either get rid of those
Minbari cruisers

25:48.375 --> 25:53.000
in the next six hours.
Or I'll kill the hostages.

25:53.083 --> 25:56.375
First the captain, then Delenn.

25:56.458 --> 25:58.208
One last thing

25:58.292 --> 26:01.125
I'm monitoring
all security channels

26:01.208 --> 26:04.833
and some of our people are still
in with your people, chief.

26:06.125 --> 26:08.625
'So don't do anything stupid.'

26:08.708 --> 26:10.958
Or these two die instantly.

26:11.042 --> 26:13.458
Just to show you I'm serious.

26:19.958 --> 26:21.250
[buzzing]

26:22.792 --> 26:24.750
No. No!

26:24.833 --> 26:26.417
Let him go.

26:26.500 --> 26:27.917
[man screaming]

26:28.000 --> 26:29.625
(Delenn)
'No.'

26:30.875 --> 26:31.833
Bastards.

26:31.917 --> 26:34.125
- Bloody bastards.
- 'Marcus!'

26:34.208 --> 26:36.000
Let him go!

26:38.708 --> 26:41.500
He has sources of his own
that don't involve security.

26:41.583 --> 26:43.708
Maybe he can find something.

26:43.792 --> 26:45.500
The trigger man.
I know his face.

26:45.583 --> 26:47.708
He's an old war buddy of Boggs.

26:47.792 --> 26:49.667
A real psycho.
Stone killer.

26:49.750 --> 26:51.792
He used to work behind enemy
lines during the Minbari War.

26:51.875 --> 26:54.417
Get me everything you've got
on his contacts.

26:54.500 --> 26:55.625
I want this call analyzed.

26:55.708 --> 26:56.875
If it can't be traced

26:56.958 --> 26:58.500
find me something else
we can use.

26:58.583 --> 27:01.042
[indistinct chatter]

27:01.125 --> 27:05.167
Hello.
Shall I deal myself in?

27:05.250 --> 27:07.750
I thought
we had an understanding.

27:07.833 --> 27:10.875
We don't bother you,
you don't bother us.

27:10.958 --> 27:13.542
That was before a close friend
of mine was abducted

27:13.625 --> 27:16.167
by some very bad people.

27:16.250 --> 27:18.042
Being rather
bad people yourselves

27:18.125 --> 27:20.917
it occurs to me that one of you
might know where she is.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.875
Well, we don't talk to security.

27:22.958 --> 27:25.042
Why should we talk to you?

27:25.125 --> 27:26.917
Because if you don't

27:27.000 --> 27:28.875
then in five minutes

27:28.958 --> 27:31.542
I'll be the only person
at this table still standing.

27:31.625 --> 27:34.042
[laughing]

27:34.125 --> 27:36.042
Five minutes after that

27:36.125 --> 27:38.208
I'll be the only person
in this room still standing.

27:38.292 --> 27:41.042
[laughing]

27:41.125 --> 27:43.500
- So, who's in?
- Yeah.

27:46.875 --> 27:49.708
[intense music]

27:55.333 --> 27:58.375
[speaking Minbari]

28:04.333 --> 28:06.625
Then we should tighten them.

28:08.333 --> 28:10.708
I picked up your language
from some POWs

28:10.792 --> 28:13.208
I took during the war.

28:13.292 --> 28:14.750
It came in real handy
when I told them

28:14.833 --> 28:16.958
to start digging
their own graves.

28:18.167 --> 28:20.042
You do realize, of course,
that neither of you

28:20.125 --> 28:21.917
are getting out of here alive.

28:23.458 --> 28:25.333
Got any thoughts about that?

28:25.417 --> 28:27.625
Yes.

28:27.708 --> 28:30.125
I feel sorry for you.

28:30.208 --> 28:32.417
Me?

28:32.500 --> 28:35.667
You feel sorry for me?

28:35.750 --> 28:37.292
Now, that's comedy.

28:38.625 --> 28:41.708
So, how do you figure
you feel sorry for me?

28:41.792 --> 28:43.542
Among Minbari

28:43.625 --> 28:45.792
one individual leads

28:45.875 --> 28:47.917
but we move as one.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.292
We are at our best
when we move together

28:51.375 --> 28:54.042
and we are at our worst
when we move together.

28:55.542 --> 28:58.625
When our leader was killed
by your people

28:58.708 --> 29:00.875
'we went mad together.'

29:00.958 --> 29:03.292
'We stayed mad
for a very long time'

29:03.375 --> 29:06.375
a madness that almost
consumed your world

29:06.458 --> 29:09.667
'til finally,
before it was too late

29:09.750 --> 29:12.500
we woke up together.

29:12.583 --> 29:14.292
But, you

29:14.375 --> 29:16.500
you are alone.

29:16.583 --> 29:20.583
You have no one to awaken you
from your madness.

29:20.667 --> 29:23.708
For this, and nothing else

29:23.792 --> 29:26.250
I feel pity for you.

29:26.333 --> 29:27.875
Screw it.

29:27.958 --> 29:29.250
No!

29:29.333 --> 29:31.333
[gunshot]

29:31.417 --> 29:32.458
(Delenn)
'Lennan!'

29:32.542 --> 29:34.167
[Lennan groaning]

29:37.042 --> 29:39.583
Sniper!
That's enough!

29:39.667 --> 29:40.958
What are you, crazy?

29:41.042 --> 29:42.458
Maybe.

29:42.542 --> 29:44.500
Ask her.

29:44.583 --> 29:46.542
- 'He's not dead.'
- 'Not yet.'

29:46.625 --> 29:49.625
'Now, we need these two alive
until this deal is finished.'

29:49.708 --> 29:52.750
Once that's done,
they're all yours. Not before.

29:52.833 --> 29:54.750
You hear me?

29:54.833 --> 29:56.625
I hear you.

30:04.750 --> 30:07.042
Where...is...she?

30:07.125 --> 30:08.875
I'm, I'm, I'm telling you,
I don't know.

30:08.958 --> 30:10.208
Then you know somebody

30:10.292 --> 30:12.208
who knows somebody
who knows something.

30:12.292 --> 30:14.375
Who? What?

30:14.458 --> 30:15.583
Answer me!

30:15.667 --> 30:17.042
[grunting]

30:22.833 --> 30:26.167
Bugger. Now, I'll have to wait
for someone to wake up.

30:28.958 --> 30:31.042
I would advise against it.

30:31.125 --> 30:33.875
I see they trained you
well back home.

30:33.958 --> 30:36.042
Yeah, well, they said
I was carrying around

30:36.125 --> 30:37.917
a lot of repressed anger.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.167
- And?
- I'm not repressed anymore.

30:42.500 --> 30:45.708
I failed once before to save
someone I cared about.

30:45.792 --> 30:49.917
I refuse to fail again.
What are you doing here?

30:50.000 --> 30:53.083
I came here to discuss
the rebirth ceremony with you.

30:53.167 --> 30:55.083
You will come, I assume.

30:55.167 --> 30:57.667
Rebirth? Why are you
worrying about that?

30:57.750 --> 30:58.958
There's much more important--

30:59.042 --> 31:00.375
It was the last thing
she asked me to do

31:00.458 --> 31:02.375
and I will see that it is done.

31:02.458 --> 31:04.417
And if you are saying
you will not come

31:04.500 --> 31:07.208
then we have nothing
more to discuss.

31:07.292 --> 31:09.958
Forget about it.
It's not important. Lennier!

31:10.042 --> 31:12.417
Do not touch me
in that fashion.

31:12.500 --> 31:16.292
We may sometimes look like you,
but we are not you.

31:16.375 --> 31:19.167
- Never forget that.
- Point taken.

31:20.833 --> 31:22.958
Don't you think that I want to
tear this station apart

31:23.042 --> 31:24.417
looking for her?

31:25.542 --> 31:29.750
She is my mentor,
my teacher, my..

31:32.208 --> 31:33.958
As part
of the rebirth ceremony

31:34.042 --> 31:35.375
I'm required
to tell someone

31:35.458 --> 31:37.792
that which I have never
told anyone before.

31:37.875 --> 31:39.750
This is as good
a time as any.

31:41.208 --> 31:42.917
I love her.

31:47.667 --> 31:49.292
You'll forgive me
if I'm little surprised

31:49.375 --> 31:51.292
at your admission.

31:51.375 --> 31:52.958
My love for Delenn

31:53.042 --> 31:55.500
is not quite
what you might think.

31:55.583 --> 31:59.583
It is not romantic love,
as you consider it.

31:59.667 --> 32:02.667
It is something higher
and nobler.

32:02.750 --> 32:05.708
A pure, perfect love,
if you will.

32:05.792 --> 32:07.625
I know that Delenn
is fated for another

32:07.708 --> 32:12.042
and I've accepted that
in my heart.

32:12.125 --> 32:13.833
But I have vowed to
stay at her side

32:13.917 --> 32:16.500
through all things
for as long as I live.

32:19.167 --> 32:22.542
That's a dangerous promise,
Lennier.

32:22.625 --> 32:25.708
Well, since I can
never tell her

32:25.792 --> 32:28.958
I tell you as my part
of the ritual.

32:29.042 --> 32:29.958
Thank you.

32:30.042 --> 32:31.208
[man groaning]

32:31.292 --> 32:32.917
Excuse me.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.792
- Hello?
- God!

32:36.875 --> 32:40.125
- This is your wake-up call.
- Come on, give me a break.

32:40.208 --> 32:41.292
Certainly.
What would you like?

32:41.375 --> 32:43.042
An arm? A leg?

32:43.125 --> 32:44.375
We're fresh out of broken hearts

32:44.458 --> 32:46.042
we just had a run on those.

32:46.125 --> 32:48.208
How about we start with your
fingers and work up?

32:48.292 --> 32:51.250
Um, hey, look, you know,
may-maybe, um

32:51.333 --> 32:52.792
maybe I, I have some information

32:52.875 --> 32:56.250
um, a-a name.

32:56.333 --> 32:58.708
You see, it's like
I've always said

32:58.792 --> 33:01.667
you can get more with
a kind word and a two by four

33:01.750 --> 33:03.667
than you can
with just a kind word.

33:03.750 --> 33:06.000
Please, continue.

33:07.917 --> 33:10.750
Hello, chief.
You been looking for me?

33:10.833 --> 33:12.542
We still haven't been
able to trace the call

33:12.625 --> 33:13.875
but we processed the signal
to pick up

33:13.958 --> 33:15.375
some details about the room.

33:15.458 --> 33:17.208
We got this background sound.

33:17.292 --> 33:18.500
[low-pitched humming]

33:18.583 --> 33:19.917
I know that sound.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.875
It's the cooling system
that feeds the fusion reactor.

33:21.958 --> 33:23.417
All that stuff
is in Grey Sector.

33:23.500 --> 33:25.042
(John)
'Well, it's a start.'

33:25.125 --> 33:26.958
That still leaves us
a lot of ground to cover.

33:27.042 --> 33:29.083
If we start poking around
blindly, they'll get wind of it

33:29.167 --> 33:30.417
and kill the hostages.

33:30.500 --> 33:32.542
We need an exact location.

33:32.625 --> 33:35.000
- Try Level 14.
- Why 14?

33:35.083 --> 33:38.042
A kind stranger volunteered
he delivered some components

33:38.125 --> 33:41.083
needed to make a call
that can't be traced.

33:41.167 --> 33:43.167
He said he'd heard one of
the men talking to someone

33:43.250 --> 33:47.083
from security about getting
the equipment to level 14.

33:47.167 --> 33:50.458
- He didn't hear which sector.
- Well, it's a shot. Susan.

33:52.708 --> 33:53.958
Grey 14.

33:55.542 --> 33:56.958
Environmental support

33:57.042 --> 33:59.667
storage areas, cooling plant.

33:59.750 --> 34:01.500
Chief, you had a problem
in 14-A?

34:01.583 --> 34:02.958
No. Why?

34:03.042 --> 34:04.417
The section's been sealed off
by security

34:04.500 --> 34:05.750
under your orders.

34:05.833 --> 34:09.000
- Never happened.
- That's the place.

34:09.083 --> 34:10.708
There's only one way in or out.

34:10.792 --> 34:12.625
The walls are fortified.

34:12.708 --> 34:14.583
'They could hold us off
for a long time.'

34:14.667 --> 34:17.583
We can't stop them from killing
the hostages if things go wrong.

34:17.667 --> 34:19.250
How much time
do we have left in the deadline?

34:19.333 --> 34:21.292
Less than an hour, but if
security's been compromised..

34:21.375 --> 34:23.458
I could put together
a team of people I can trust.

34:23.542 --> 34:25.083
Make it a small team.,
the more people the more chance

34:25.167 --> 34:26.417
they'll hear about it.

34:26.500 --> 34:27.792
Marcus, did your contact

34:27.875 --> 34:29.333
give a description
of the security guard?

34:29.417 --> 34:31.500
Yes. Very detailed, in fact.

34:31.583 --> 34:33.458
Good, because I have an idea.

34:33.542 --> 34:35.208
Which is?

34:35.292 --> 34:36.750
We're going to surrender.

34:37.875 --> 34:40.000
- How much longer?
- Ten minutes.

34:41.708 --> 34:43.250
They've got to know
we're not bluffing.

34:43.333 --> 34:45.625
They can't be that stupid,
can they?

34:45.708 --> 34:47.875
Always bet on stupidity.

34:47.958 --> 34:50.667
- Boggs, are you there?
- Right here.

34:50.750 --> 34:52.292
Damn it, I told you
not to call me on this channel.

34:52.375 --> 34:54.250
The Minbari have pulled out.

34:54.333 --> 34:56.333
(Boggs)
'What? Are you sure?'

34:56.417 --> 34:59.333
See for yourself.
Going to secure cam input.

35:00.417 --> 35:02.208
'They jumped
about five minutes ago.'

35:02.292 --> 35:04.708
'They gave Sheridan
his walking orders.'

35:04.792 --> 35:07.417
'Any harm comes to Delenn,
they'll hunt him down.'

35:07.500 --> 35:11.333
So, he won't move against you
so long as she's in custody.

35:11.417 --> 35:13.583
Excellent! We're in business.

35:13.667 --> 35:15.833
Send a narrow-beam transmission
back home.

35:15.917 --> 35:17.875
Tell them to
send in the marines.

35:17.958 --> 35:20.333
Our people will be here
in less than an hour.

35:20.417 --> 35:21.667
Once they get here..

35:21.750 --> 35:23.708
[rumbling]

35:23.792 --> 35:24.833
They're coming in.

35:24.917 --> 35:26.667
Oh, that doesn't sound right.

35:26.750 --> 35:27.792
[alarm blaring]

35:27.875 --> 35:30.000
[indistinct shouting]

35:32.500 --> 35:34.375
Hey. What's going on?

35:34.458 --> 35:36.042
Coolant line
to Reactor Seven just blew.

35:36.125 --> 35:37.833
There is a leak
in the fusion reactor

35:37.917 --> 35:40.333
'and it's venting this way.
Let me go.'

35:40.417 --> 35:42.625
Oh, no. Look at this.

35:42.708 --> 35:44.458
[automated]
'Please remain calm.'

35:44.542 --> 35:46.833
Everybody out!
Take them with you.

35:46.917 --> 35:48.833
We need them for insurance.
Move!

35:48.917 --> 35:52.375
[automated]
'Please proceed immediately
to a designated..'

35:52.458 --> 35:54.167
[beeping]

35:55.583 --> 35:58.250
Security! Drop them! Freeze!

35:58.333 --> 36:00.125
[gunshots]

36:14.250 --> 36:16.250
[grunting]

36:21.833 --> 36:23.583
Cover me.

36:27.333 --> 36:29.042
[groaning]

36:31.000 --> 36:34.250
John! John, look out!

36:34.333 --> 36:35.833
[groaning]

36:37.833 --> 36:39.958
- Oh, my God.
- Delenn!

36:41.083 --> 36:43.792
Medics! Medics!

36:45.333 --> 36:48.000
Let her go, John.
We'll take care of her.

36:48.083 --> 36:50.208
- We'll take care of her. Go!
- You take care of her.

36:50.292 --> 36:52.333
- Go!
- He's mine!

36:55.875 --> 36:58.917
[dramatic music]

37:05.375 --> 37:07.125
[grunting]

37:16.083 --> 37:18.667
No more. No more of you.

37:18.750 --> 37:21.875
No more Night Watch.
No more hostages. No more lies.

37:21.958 --> 37:25.125
Not on my station!
Not on my watch!

37:25.208 --> 37:26.500
No more!

37:28.292 --> 37:30.083
[grunting]

37:33.458 --> 37:35.292
[breathing heavily]

37:38.042 --> 37:39.417
No more.

37:42.417 --> 37:45.000
Lennier, any news on Delenn?

37:45.083 --> 37:47.500
Yes. The knife
missed her vital organs

37:47.583 --> 37:48.958
and embedded itself in her rib.

37:49.042 --> 37:51.375
Dr. Franklin says
she will make a full recovery.

37:51.458 --> 37:54.000
Oh, then we can go ahead
with the rebirth ceremony

37:54.083 --> 37:55.833
she talked about.

37:55.917 --> 37:58.000
I'm afraid that is
impossible for now.

37:58.083 --> 38:00.667
The ceremony must be held
within a certain amount of time

38:00.750 --> 38:04.750
once preparations have begun
and that time is almost past.

38:04.833 --> 38:07.542
And Delenn is in no condition
to conduct it now.

38:12.250 --> 38:15.542
So where is Garibaldi?
I figured he'd be here.

38:15.625 --> 38:17.125
He's still working
with the tech crews

38:17.208 --> 38:18.833
trying to get the computer
systems back in shape.

38:18.917 --> 38:21.542
They say they'll finally have
the artificial personality

38:21.625 --> 38:23.542
purged by midnight.

38:23.625 --> 38:25.708
[automated]
'Oh, not that
my bruised feelings'

38:25.792 --> 38:27.042
'would have
any meaning for you'

38:27.125 --> 38:29.125
'but why are you
having these people'

38:29.208 --> 38:30.708
'poke me all over the place?'

38:30.792 --> 38:33.792
'I'm a perfectly reasonable
artificial personality.'

38:33.875 --> 38:35.667
'Nobody's ever
complained before.'

38:35.750 --> 38:38.125
'but I guess some people
just aren't happy'

38:38.208 --> 38:40.208
'unless they're messing it up
for everyone else.'

38:40.292 --> 38:42.208
'You know, you really should
stand up straight'

38:42.292 --> 38:44.542
'your mother and I have been
worried about this for years'

38:44.625 --> 38:46.375
'we've been trying to talk
to you about it, but..'

38:46.458 --> 38:48.458
[gunshot]

38:48.542 --> 38:50.958
[electricity crackling]

38:51.042 --> 38:53.833
You should get
some rest, Lennier.

38:53.917 --> 38:56.333
You haven't slept
since I was put here.

38:56.417 --> 38:59.333
I will rest when it is time.

39:11.583 --> 39:14.250
Hello, Delenn.

39:14.333 --> 39:15.792
You know, I was thinking

39:15.875 --> 39:18.417
if you couldn't come
to the rebirth ceremony

39:18.500 --> 39:20.750
the ceremony
should come to you.

39:25.250 --> 39:27.708
I've given up something that

39:27.792 --> 39:29.833
really mattered to me.

39:31.583 --> 39:33.917
The uniform and everything
that goes with it.

39:35.333 --> 39:39.000
'What I've never told
anyone before now..'

39:40.542 --> 39:42.625
...when you were hurt..

39:43.708 --> 39:46.000
...when you were in my arms..

39:47.667 --> 39:50.250
I was ready to kill that guy
with my bare hands.

39:51.917 --> 39:54.208
And I realized
I'd never told you..

39:56.083 --> 39:58.625
...how much I care about you

39:58.708 --> 40:00.667
how much you mean to me.

40:02.667 --> 40:04.708
'I think it's time
you knew that.'

40:06.708 --> 40:10.417
I can no longer imagine my world

40:10.500 --> 40:12.625
without you in it.

40:16.375 --> 40:19.292
I don't know exactly

40:19.375 --> 40:21.208
when or how it happened.

40:23.917 --> 40:25.958
But I'm glad it did.

40:27.625 --> 40:30.708
[instrumental music]

40:44.000 --> 40:46.958
No one knows, but, uh..

40:47.042 --> 40:49.083
...I'm afraid all the time..

40:50.417 --> 40:52.833
...of what I might do
if I ever let go.

40:57.042 --> 40:58.833
[music continues]

41:05.583 --> 41:08.375
I think I loved Talia.

41:22.958 --> 41:25.667
I, uh..

41:25.750 --> 41:28.042
I think I have a problem.

41:29.583 --> 41:31.625
[music continues]

41:39.292 --> 41:40.667
(Lennier)
'Wait, please.'

41:40.750 --> 41:43.750
Before you go,
as part of the ceremony

41:43.833 --> 41:46.250
Delenn had something
made for you.

41:46.333 --> 41:49.083
I think she was expecting
your actions.

41:49.167 --> 41:52.292
The gifts are waiting for you
in your quarters.

41:52.375 --> 41:55.250
[instrumental music]

42:25.833 --> 42:28.375
[music continues]

42:35.542 --> 42:36.958
What's the matter,
haven't you ever seen someone

42:37.042 --> 42:38.875
who's been reborn before?

42:41.083 --> 42:45.208
The crisis, for now, is over.

42:45.292 --> 42:47.083
Tell the ships..

42:48.167 --> 42:50.375
...we're open for business.

43:05.833 --> 43:07.542
[theme music]
