He was trying to make this day special.

05:01.427 --> 05:04.888
(chuckles): Oh, you mean
by ruining my carefully planned party.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.349
Wow, thank you, dear son-in-law.

05:07.433 --> 05:10.019
-What was that?
-Oh, hey, nothing, honeybat.

05:14.231 --> 05:17.818
Dad, I know you and Johnny
don't always see eye to eye,

05:17.901 --> 05:20.696
but I love him
and I wouldn't change a thing.

05:20.779 --> 05:21.989
Really?

05:22.072 --> 05:25.159
You sure you wouldn't make
just a few teensy changes?

05:26.368 --> 05:28.537
-Better, no?
-No!

05:29.413 --> 05:31.874
He's perfect just the way he is.

05:31.957 --> 05:33.584
Okay, okay.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.294
Whatever you say, honeybat.

05:35.377 --> 05:38.964

Now, let's continue this special day,

05:39.048 --> 05:41.383
'cause it's gonna get
even more specialier.

05:41.467 --> 05:43.385

05:57.733 --> 05:59.234
I guess I killed it.

05:59.318 --> 06:01.236
All right, next up, we got... (grunts)

06:01.320 --> 06:02.613
Thank you, Johnny.

06:02.696 --> 06:03.947
How wonderful.

06:04.031 --> 06:07.159
And don't forget, precisely at midnight,

06:07.242 --> 06:11.038
I will make a special
once-in-a-lifetime announcement!

06:11.121 --> 06:13.248
In the meantime,
sit back and enjoy the band.

Yoo-hoo! You ready for
your big speech, honeyfangs?

06:26.720 --> 06:28.680
Yes, I think so.

06:28.764 --> 06:33.352
But (groans) Johnny is
giving me the greatest headache

06:33.435 --> 06:35.646
of my entire existence right now,

06:35.729 --> 06:39.483
like a giant wooden stake
right through my brain!

06:39.566 --> 06:40.692
Oh, you know Johnny.

06:40.776 --> 06:42.236
He just gets a little carried away.

06:42.319 --> 06:43.987
Yes, exactly.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.280
And ruins everything.

06:45.364 --> 06:46.657
That's the problem.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.951
Well, you're gonna have to
get used to things being done

06:49.034 --> 06:51.036
a little differently around here
when you retire.

06:51.120 --> 06:52.121
Shh!

06:52.204 --> 06:55.499
(echoing):
...when you retire.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.126
Retire?

06:57.209 --> 06:58.544
DRACULA:
Not so loud.

06:58.627 --> 07:00.337
Mavis has supersonic hearing.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.588
ERICKA:
Why would she be listening?

07:01.672 --> 07:03.257
Don't be so paranoid.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.717
Yes, I-I'm sure you're right.

07:05.801 --> 07:09.930
I just... (sighs) I don't want
anything else to go wrong.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.266
Everything has to be perfect

07:12.349 --> 07:15.894
when I finally give the hotel to Mavis.

07:15.978 --> 07:17.521
What?!

07:17.604 --> 07:19.022
And Johnny.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.899
Yes, and Johnny.

07:20.983 --> 07:23.152
Oh, it is a big step.

07:23.235 --> 07:25.988
I know how much this hotel means to you.

07:26.071 --> 07:30.367
Ah, yes, but it is time to let go

07:30.450 --> 07:33.704
and start a new chapter, together.

07:33.787 --> 07:37.207
Well, you are just all sorts
of wonderful, aren't you?

07:37.291 --> 07:41.503
Well, it's not for nothing
that they call me

07:41.587 --> 07:43.463
Count Wonderful.

07:43.547 --> 07:45.632
Oh. Do they?

07:45.716 --> 07:48.969
(singsongy): And also
Dark Prince of Loveliness.

You're never gonna believe it!

08:05.152 --> 08:06.528
What? What's going on?

08:06.612 --> 08:09.156
Johnny, you better sit down for this.

08:09.239 --> 08:10.908
Babe, you're freaking me out here.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.327
(gasps) Dad is gonna retire

08:13.410 --> 08:15.495
and leave us the hotel!

08:30.344 --> 08:31.595

08:31.678 --> 08:33.722
I didn't even know
he was thinking of retiring.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.265
Shh. Neither did I.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.768
Oh, my gosh, Mavis, I'm so happy for you.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.436
You're gonna be amazing!

08:39.519 --> 08:41.605
You mean we're going to be amazing.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.024
Dad's leaving the hotel to both of us.

08:44.107 --> 08:45.317
Really?

08:45.400 --> 08:46.526
Both of us?

08:46.610 --> 08:47.694
Are you sure?

08:47.778 --> 08:49.613
Of course. Why wouldn't he?

08:49.696 --> 08:51.531
Oh, uh, I don't know.

08:51.615 --> 08:53.867
I-I guess I just never got the feeling

08:53.951 --> 08:56.286
that he really thought of me as, you know,

08:56.370 --> 08:57.746
part of the family.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.915
What are you talking about?

08:59.998 --> 09:01.500
Of course you're part of the family.

09:01.583 --> 09:06.922
No, I know, but you know
how Cranky Fangs is sometimes.

09:07.005 --> 09:10.425
I mean, it feels like I am,
but not really.

09:10.509 --> 09:11.718
That's not true.

09:11.802 --> 09:13.679
Well, not anymore it isn't!

I better walk this off.

Hey, how's it going? Nothing to see.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.357
Nothing much to talk about,
except for the greatest thing

09:25.440 --> 09:27.442
happening in the entire universe.

09:27.526 --> 09:29.403

09:29.486 --> 09:31.071
Hey, Drac! Hey, Drac!

09:31.154 --> 09:32.614
Oh, no. No.

09:32.698 --> 09:34.032
Just keep it cool, Johnny.

Mavis?

21:13.439 --> 21:14.774
Mavis?

21:14.857 --> 21:18.528
This is gonna be the coolest surprise
when you see the surprise!

21:18.611 --> 21:20.238
(whoops, laughs)

21:20.321 --> 21:22.740
H-Hey! Tinkles!

21:22.824 --> 21:24.325
Hey, Dennis. Hey, Winnie.

21:24.409 --> 21:26.828
Dad? Is that you?

21:26.911 --> 21:28.162
Yeah! Isn't it great?

21:28.246 --> 21:30.331
I got to go show your mom. (laughs)

21:33.251 --> 21:34.252
(gasps)

21:35.545 --> 21:37.547
Papa Drac, is that my dad?

21:37.630 --> 21:39.590
(stammering)

21:39.674 --> 21:41.759
(spooky voice):
That was not your father,

21:41.843 --> 21:43.886
just some random monster.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.139
Everything is normal.

21:46.222 --> 21:49.517
BOTH (monotone):
Everything is normal.

21:49.600 --> 21:53.062
Mavis? Where are you?

21:53.146 --> 21:54.313
(gasps)

21:55.314 --> 21:56.733
The party!

21:59.777 --> 22:02.697
Mavis, I've got the best news ever!

22:02.780 --> 22:04.282
Whoa-oh!

22:04.365 --> 22:05.366
(grunting)

22:06.451 --> 22:07.869
(elevator bell dings)

22:09.996 --> 22:11.456
(grunts)

22:12.999 --> 22:15.084
(panting)

22:20.757 --> 22:22.550
(elevator bell dings)

22:25.386 --> 22:26.429
Oh, no.

22:26.512 --> 22:28.431
(screaming)

22:30.433 --> 22:31.559
Drac?

22:32.769 --> 22:34.145
(grunting)

22:35.688 --> 22:37.065
(whimpering)

22:39.650 --> 22:40.693
(screaming)

22:40.777 --> 22:42.195
Oh, no!

22:42.278 --> 22:43.613
Something's wrong!

22:43.696 --> 22:44.947
Don't worry! (grunts)

22:45.031 --> 22:47.408
I got you, Drac!

22:48.493 --> 22:49.452
(chewing noisily)

22:49.535 --> 22:51.037
GRIFFIN:
Hey, Frank, relax.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.455
It's not a contest.

22:52.538 --> 22:54.749
(Dracula screaming)

22:54.832 --> 22:55.958
-Huh?
-Huh?

22:56.042 --> 22:57.919
(Johnny screaming)

23:00.755 --> 23:01.839
(panting)

23:01.923 --> 23:02.924
Drac?

23:04.926 --> 23:05.927
Hey, guys.

23:06.010 --> 23:07.220
ALL:
Johnny?

23:07.303 --> 23:08.304
Is that you?!

23:08.387 --> 23:09.847
Yeah, it's me.

23:09.931 --> 23:11.182
Pretty great, right?

23:11.265 --> 23:13.392
-Whoa. -What's going on?
-What happened to you?

23:13.476 --> 23:14.685
GRIFFIN:
Wait, where's Drac?

23:14.769 --> 23:15.812
DRACULA:
Help!

23:15.895 --> 23:17.563
(screams)

23:17.647 --> 23:18.648
Drac?

23:18.731 --> 23:19.941
Hey, come on down here!

23:20.024 --> 23:21.275
Did you see Johnny?

23:21.359 --> 23:22.485
He's a monster!

23:22.568 --> 23:23.694
DRACULA:
I know!

23:23.778 --> 23:25.822
I can't fly!

23:25.905 --> 23:28.449
Did he just say "Wow, that's a fly"?

23:28.533 --> 23:30.910
GRIFFIN: No, he definitely
said something about pie.

23:30.993 --> 23:32.954
Stop fooling around and come down here!

23:33.037 --> 23:34.789
I'm not fooling around!

23:34.872 --> 23:35.957
I... (shouts)

23:36.040 --> 23:38.000
(screaming)

23:40.294 --> 23:44.257
Uh, guys, he's not turning into a bat.

23:44.340 --> 23:45.883
Don't worry. I got him.

23:48.052 --> 23:49.720
-Whoa.
-Hey.

23:49.804 --> 23:51.973
(panting)

23:53.015 --> 23:54.684
(groaning)

23:54.767 --> 23:56.686
(grunting)

23:56.769 --> 23:57.979
(all gasp)

24:02.900 --> 24:03.901
(all gasp)

24:03.985 --> 24:04.986
Drac?

24:05.069 --> 24:06.821
Y-You-you look, uh, uh...

24:06.904 --> 24:08.573
You look terrible.

24:08.656 --> 24:10.533
(gasps) Oh, no.

24:10.616 --> 24:11.659
Oh, no, no, no.

24:11.742 --> 24:13.286
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

24:13.369 --> 24:14.537
No!

24:14.620 --> 24:16.414
It can't be.

24:16.497 --> 24:18.499
(whimpering)

24:21.752 --> 24:23.045
(sobs)

24:23.129 --> 24:25.298
Wow, look at us, Drac.

24:25.381 --> 24:28.134
You're human and I'm a monster.

24:28.217 --> 24:31.345
It's like Freaky Friday
but on a Tuesday, though.

24:31.429 --> 24:33.389
(screaming)

24:34.473 --> 24:36.142
Where is it? Where is it?

24:36.225 --> 24:37.727
It's got to be here somewhere.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.562
What is going on, Drac?

24:39.645 --> 24:41.814
I need to find the ray!

24:41.898 --> 24:43.357
You mean that one right there?

24:43.441 --> 24:45.109
-(moans)
-Ooh-hoo-hoo!

24:45.193 --> 24:46.235
(grunting)

24:46.319 --> 24:48.112
Come on. Come on!

24:48.196 --> 24:49.906
Why isn't this working? Come on!

24:49.989 --> 24:51.741
I think it might be broken.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.284
(sobs):
No!

24:53.367 --> 24:54.410
It can't be.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.870
Hey, have you seen my dad?

24:55.953 --> 24:57.205
(shouts)

24:57.288 --> 24:58.331
Come on, Johnny. (grunts)

24:58.414 --> 24:59.540
We're getting out of here.

24:59.624 --> 25:00.833
-What? No way.
-(straining)

25:00.917 --> 25:03.461
I got to tell Mavis
that her dream is back on.

25:03.544 --> 25:05.379
You know, now that I'm a monster and all.

25:05.463 --> 25:06.464
No, no, no, no, no, no.

25:06.547 --> 25:08.507
(spooky voice):
You will obey me.

25:08.591 --> 25:11.302
You will come with me!

25:13.679 --> 25:15.598
Hey, Mavis, I got great news!

25:15.681 --> 25:17.600
(grunting nervously)

25:17.683 --> 25:18.976
(screams)

25:19.060 --> 25:20.228
Johnny.

25:20.311 --> 25:22.355
(grunting dramatically)

25:22.438 --> 25:23.564
Huh?

25:23.648 --> 25:25.191
Hey, Drac, what's wrong?

25:25.274 --> 25:27.485
Oh, it is the humanness!

25:27.568 --> 25:28.694
(grunting dramatically)

25:28.778 --> 25:30.112
Drac! Oh, my gosh!

25:30.196 --> 25:31.447
Wh-What do we do?

25:31.530 --> 25:34.450
Quick, take me to Van Helsing!

25:34.533 --> 25:35.785
(grunting dramatically)

25:35.868 --> 25:37.495
Oh, okay. I got you, Drac.

25:37.578 --> 25:39.914
Do not tell Mavis!

25:39.997 --> 25:41.624
Ooh! Ow-wee! The lab!

25:41.707 --> 25:46.128
Hurry! I can feel my insides melting away!

25:47.380 --> 25:49.882
Uh... wh-what just happened?

25:49.966 --> 25:50.967
-MAVIS: Hey.
-(all gasp)

25:51.050 --> 25:51.968
Was that my dad?

25:52.051 --> 25:53.511
No. What? Uh, no.

25:53.594 --> 25:54.762
-Absolutely not.
-Nope.

25:54.845 --> 25:56.639
GRIFFIN: Are you doing
something different with your hair?

25:56.722 --> 25:59.350
Um, what is going on?

25:59.433 --> 26:00.977
What's going on?

26:01.060 --> 26:05.564
Um, Wayne here was about to
show off some new dance moves.

26:05.648 --> 26:07.525
-Dance moves?
-Yeah, go get 'em.

26:07.608 --> 26:08.609
-Whoa.
-Go get 'em.

26:08.693 --> 26:10.611
Uh, um...

26:10.695 --> 26:12.113
(grunting softly)

26:14.782 --> 26:15.992
(chuckles):
Yeah.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.077
(grunting rhythmically)

26:19.745 --> 26:20.871
Oh.

26:20.955 --> 26:22.832
Huh?

26:22.915 --> 26:24.041
Okay.

26:24.125 --> 26:25.918
Uh, well, if you see my dad,

26:26.002 --> 26:27.837
please tell him I need to talk to him.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.339
(Wayne continues grunting rhythmically)

26:30.423 --> 26:31.590
Oh, yeah.

26:31.674 --> 26:32.675
(laughs)

26:32.758 --> 26:33.926
Watch me now. Yeah.

26:34.010 --> 26:35.886
(screams, grunts)

26:35.970 --> 26:37.346
Ow.

26:37.430 --> 26:39.307
♪ ♪

26:39.390 --> 26:40.975
Well, it's broken.

26:41.058 --> 26:43.894
The crystal's cracked,
and it's beyond repair.

26:43.978 --> 26:45.771
Wait, what?! (grunts)

26:45.855 --> 26:47.398
Then get a new one!

26:47.481 --> 26:49.859
Whoa. Someone's feeling better.

26:49.942 --> 26:53.821
These crystals are very rare
and hard to come by.

26:53.904 --> 26:57.408
It took me three years to find that one.

26:57.491 --> 27:00.661
You see, I was a young
monster hunter at the time--

27:00.745 --> 27:02.788
well, not too young, but I felt young.

27:02.872 --> 27:04.957
Okay, don't need the whole story.

27:05.041 --> 27:08.711
Well, luckily for you,
I was brilliant enough to install

27:08.794 --> 27:13.299
a locator on the ray
for just this situation.

27:13.382 --> 27:15.384
(clicking, whirring)

27:17.720 --> 27:19.096
There it is!

27:19.180 --> 27:21.432
-South America?!
-JOHNNY: Oh, cool!

27:21.515 --> 27:24.852
I was there once spelunking
with some Norwegian wrestlers.

27:24.935 --> 27:27.396
We can just pop down there
and get a new one!

27:27.480 --> 27:30.149
If it were but that simple, my friend.

27:30.232 --> 27:34.904
First, you must travel through
the treacherous jungle.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.490
Survival's doubtful.

27:37.573 --> 27:39.950
Then down a perilous river...

27:40.034 --> 27:40.993
BOTH:
Whoa.

27:41.077 --> 27:44.622
...until you reach
the Cave of the Reflexión!

27:46.415 --> 27:49.919
Where entering is deadly

27:50.002 --> 27:54.757
and escape impossible!

27:54.840 --> 27:56.425
It... it...

27:56.509 --> 28:00.388
it cost me my right back wheel.

28:01.889 --> 28:05.476
Uh, sorry for your loss?

28:06.560 --> 28:07.770
(steady beeping)

28:07.853 --> 28:10.064
Well, happy hunting.

28:10.147 --> 28:13.067
(groans) This is a disaster!

28:13.150 --> 28:14.443
JOHNNY:
Don't worry, Drac.

28:14.527 --> 28:16.070
We'll get you back to your old self.

28:16.153 --> 28:17.822
But first, I better tell Mavis
we're going.

28:17.905 --> 28:19.657
(stammers)
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

28:19.740 --> 28:21.492
You can't tell Mavis!

28:21.575 --> 28:22.993
Why not?

28:23.077 --> 28:26.622
Uh, because, uh, you know, if you do,

28:26.705 --> 28:28.999
then, uh, then she will
want to come with us,

28:29.083 --> 28:31.961
and-and I was thinking that this could be

28:32.044 --> 28:35.214
a-a father-son, uh, bonding type of thing.

28:35.297 --> 28:36.382
Yes. (chuckles)

28:36.465 --> 28:39.301
You know, just the two of us?

28:39.385 --> 28:40.553
Really?

28:40.636 --> 28:42.430
-Awesome!
-Hold up, hold up.

28:42.513 --> 28:44.390
There'll be plenty of hugs on the trip.

28:44.473 --> 28:46.142
All right, time to go.

28:46.225 --> 28:47.726
Not a moment to waste!

28:47.810 --> 28:49.520
(pants, grunts)

28:49.603 --> 28:50.855
Right.

28:50.938 --> 28:53.023
Still human.

28:55.818 --> 28:58.237
FRANK: I-I don't know.
It took me by surprise.

28:58.320 --> 28:59.989
It's, uh, kind of an improvement.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.658
Right? I think Johnny looks
way better as a monster.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.326
GRIFFIN:
Yeah, there's a good-looking guy in there.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.787
Ooh, and the green
really brings out his eyes.

29:06.871 --> 29:08.456
-(phone chimes, vibrates)
-Hey, it's Drac.

29:08.539 --> 29:12.209
"Going to find crystal to fix ray

29:12.293 --> 29:14.462
to turn us back to normal."

29:14.545 --> 29:16.046
"Don't tell Mavis"?

29:16.130 --> 29:18.007
(groans) Drac always does this.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.134
I hate getting caught
between him and Mavis.

29:20.217 --> 29:21.469
What should I write back?

29:21.552 --> 29:25.431
How about, "No, we're not
covering for you anymore"?

29:25.514 --> 29:26.891
GRIFFIN:
Yeah, "Now that you're human,

29:26.974 --> 29:28.601
you can't do nothing about it."

29:28.684 --> 29:31.395
"Go do your own dirty work
for a change, buster."

29:31.479 --> 29:33.481
Okay, got it. Send.

29:33.564 --> 29:34.940
-What?! -What?!
-You actually sent that?!

29:35.024 --> 29:37.443
Oh, man, we're in trouble now.

29:37.526 --> 29:39.111
Nah, I just sent him a gif.

29:39.195 --> 29:41.197
(upbeat music playing)

29:41.280 --> 29:42.490
(burbles)

29:42.573 --> 29:44.575
Oh, hey, Blobby, check it out.

29:46.076 --> 29:47.203
(Frank laughs)

29:47.286 --> 29:48.496
That's a nice one, Blobby.

29:48.579 --> 29:49.955
GRIFFIN:
Hey, here's to Blobby.

29:50.039 --> 29:52.291
(burbling)

29:52.374 --> 29:54.960
-(startled burbling)
-No, Bl-- No, Blobby.

29:55.044 --> 29:57.796
I just said, "Here's a toast
to a bunch of great guys."

29:57.880 --> 29:59.465
What does he think I said?

29:59.548 --> 30:00.716
(growls)

30:00.799 --> 30:02.009
Cheers!

30:02.092 --> 30:03.761
(all gulping noisily)

30:08.432 --> 30:09.934
(all sigh)

30:10.017 --> 30:11.352
(stomach gurgles)

30:11.435 --> 30:13.145
Huh? Whoa!

30:13.229 --> 30:15.147
(groaning)

30:15.231 --> 30:17.608
(whimpering)

30:17.691 --> 30:21.612
Something is happening.

30:21.695 --> 30:23.447
Oh! (screams)

30:23.531 --> 30:25.449
Oh. (gasps, screams)

30:25.533 --> 30:27.368
Oh, no. No, nose, nose!

30:27.451 --> 30:29.370
Uh, wh... why?
