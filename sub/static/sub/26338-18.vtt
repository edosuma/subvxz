<i>Nicholas Helman.</i>

00:21.487 --> 00:24.657

this place is first-rate</i>

02:17.326 --> 02:18.675
as far
as conventional care goes.

02:18.763 --> 02:21.296
However, I read about
an experimental drug in China.

02:21.384 --> 02:22.806
- Your knight,
- bishop...

02:22.918 --> 02:25.636
The way you're playing,
there's just so many options.

02:25.794 --> 02:27.972
There's also that top clinic
in Berlin I told you about.

02:28.068 --> 02:30.546
The wait list is long,
but I made some calls, so...

02:30.634 --> 02:32.444
You know who you should call?
Bobby Fischer,

02:32.532 --> 02:35.660
because this is turning
into a massacre.

02:35.748 --> 02:36.789
Are you even listening to me?

02:36.877 --> 02:38.690
Not really. You should get
your head in the game.

02:38.778 --> 02:41.364
My head is exactly
where it should be, Dad.

02:41.517 --> 02:42.900
Focused on getting you

02:42.988 --> 02:44.582
the best cancer
treatment available.

02:44.957 --> 02:46.809
I'm already getting
the best treatment.

02:46.897 --> 02:47.699
Yeah, well,

02:47.787 --> 02:49.285
chemo's not without
side effects.

02:49.373 --> 02:50.793
And the results have been mixed.

02:50.881 --> 02:52.754
That's not what I mean.

02:54.192 --> 02:55.535
Oh.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.145
As much as I love spending time
with you, and I do,

02:59.233 --> 03:01.410
we both know that it's not
gonna save your life.

03:07.309 --> 03:08.855
Matty needs me

03:08.943 --> 03:10.738
Director Webber,
perfect timing as usual.

03:11.004 --> 03:12.355
I know.

03:12.920 --> 03:14.090
Checkmate.

03:15.004 --> 03:16.293
All right, let's go.

03:17.004 --> 03:18.590
Uh, Dad, you need to rest.

03:18.678 --> 03:20.020
I'll manage.

03:20.108 --> 03:22.676
Besides, going to work
takes my mind off things.

03:22.764 --> 03:24.278
I really think
you should stay.

03:24.366 --> 03:25.863
I appreciate your
opinion, son,

03:25.951 --> 03:27.520
but I don't need
your approval.

03:27.685 --> 03:31.120
I'm your boss, remember,
and next time you let me win,

03:31.769 --> 03:34.020
try to be less obvious.

03:40.839 --> 03:42.168
<i>All right, listen up.</i>

03:42.256 --> 03:44.176
<i>Last night a man was murdered</i>

03:44.264 --> 03:46.477

03:46.662 --> 03:49.400
Currently police have
no suspects, but

03:49.488 --> 03:53.415
one patron did manage to capture
this video on their cell phone.

Why is everyone shocked

04:04.376 --> 04:05.626
that the silver fox can sing?

04:05.773 --> 04:07.216
'Cause that's Nicholas Helman,

04:07.303 --> 04:09.656
one of the world's most
prolific killers for hire.

04:09.743 --> 04:10.861
Old man's an assassin?

04:10.972 --> 04:14.749
More like the <i> best</i> assassin.
Long, very violent

04:14.837 --> 04:15.616
story short,

04:15.704 --> 04:16.939
the last time we saw Helman,

04:17.048 --> 04:18.866
he was being zipped up
into a body bag.

04:18.954 --> 04:20.564
But today I had two agents

04:20.652 --> 04:23.331
exhume his coffin,
and it was empty.

04:26.022 --> 04:27.337
Who was Helman's target?

04:27.425 --> 04:28.439
The victim

04:28.527 --> 04:30.940
was FBI interrogator
Michael Evans.

04:31.036 --> 04:32.361
His primary focus

04:32.492 --> 04:33.650
was organized crime.

04:33.738 --> 04:36.499
SFPD and FBI
are working his murder.

04:36.587 --> 04:38.812
But since Phoenix
is responsible for Helman

04:38.900 --> 04:39.956
still roaming the Earth,

04:40.043 --> 04:41.882
it's on us to catch him.

04:41.970 --> 04:44.454
I've already reached out to
the FBI to get more information

04:44.563 --> 04:45.585
on Special Agent Evans.

04:45.673 --> 04:46.826
You know, it's possible

04:46.913 --> 04:48.718
someone Evans was chasing
hired Helman.

04:48.806 --> 04:50.596
Helman gets his jobs
from the Dark Web.

04:50.683 --> 04:52.226
I could search around,
try to see who

04:52.313 --> 04:53.517
was retaining
his services.

04:53.605 --> 04:54.359
Get on it.

04:54.447 --> 04:55.423
That means you three

04:55.511 --> 04:56.694
tag along with me.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.373
Cool, riding with
the big man.

04:58.522 --> 04:59.806
So where we going?

05:00.914 --> 05:03.341
To speak to the one person
who knows Helman better

05:03.429 --> 05:04.572
than anyone else.

05:05.919 --> 05:07.837
I'm guessing it's not his mom?

05:07.924 --> 05:09.624
That's a big no.

05:20.462 --> 05:22.314
<i>Roll down your windows.</i>

05:32.750 --> 05:34.962
- Talk about remote.
-  Trust me,

05:35.092 --> 05:36.298
the guy you're about to meet,

05:36.386 --> 05:39.056
you want as far away from
populated areas as possible.

05:39.345 --> 05:41.634
The Moon would
be too close.

06:17.701 --> 06:19.961
Sir, follow me, please.

06:26.405 --> 06:28.139
Okay, enough suspense.

06:28.319 --> 06:30.066
What kind of monster
you keeping down here?

06:30.153 --> 06:32.303
Indominus Rex?
King Kong?

06:35.412 --> 06:36.788
That kid from <i> The Omen?</i>

06:36.876 --> 06:39.257
The only prisoner
kept here has a son.

06:39.893 --> 06:42.531
And since field trips off-campus

06:42.619 --> 06:44.250
aren't really an option,
once a month

06:44.338 --> 06:46.094
there's a supervised
visit here.

06:53.220 --> 06:54.768
When I heard
I was getting visitors,

06:54.856 --> 06:56.846
I didn't want
to get my hopes up,

06:57.166 --> 06:58.916
but here you are.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.307
Wilt, always a pleasure.

07:02.518 --> 07:03.963
A new Avenger.

07:04.205 --> 07:05.288
Lovely.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.588
I do hope
that we can be friends.

07:09.128 --> 07:10.690
Or not.

07:13.799 --> 07:17.955
Could it be?
The Mac Daddy himself?

07:18.244 --> 07:19.416
Truly honored.

07:19.619 --> 07:21.316
Whatever could be so important?

07:21.403 --> 07:23.046
Helman is alive.

07:25.119 --> 07:26.627
Good one, boy scout.

07:26.799 --> 07:28.580
We both saw me shoot him.

07:30.942 --> 07:32.180
<i>Then the men came,</i>

07:32.268 --> 07:33.806
zipped him in a body bag,
drove him off

07:33.894 --> 07:34.913
to be buried in a hole.

07:35.001 --> 07:36.866
And yet he never
made it there.

07:37.783 --> 07:38.932
You're serious.

07:39.143 --> 07:40.252
Very.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.400
That's a wrinkle.

07:43.251 --> 07:44.665
We're here to get your help.

07:45.712 --> 07:47.136
Putting him in the ground?

07:47.970 --> 07:49.506
Finding him.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.776
Boring.

07:52.955 --> 07:56.316
Karaoke bars, dead bodies,

07:56.403 --> 07:58.572
blah, blah, blah.

07:59.134 --> 08:00.210
I'm just so happy

08:00.298 --> 08:03.072
to finally meet the man
who abandoned

08:03.160 --> 08:04.370
my BFF.

08:04.458 --> 08:06.517
How's the reconciliation
going?

08:06.853 --> 08:09.689
I'm sensing some tension.
Anything we need to talk out?

08:09.783 --> 08:11.439
<i>You are not
kidding about this one.</i>

08:11.564 --> 08:13.642
He is special.

08:13.730 --> 08:16.546
The deeper you go,
the darker it gets.

08:16.634 --> 08:18.523
Mac's dad's no easy
puzzle, either.

08:18.611 --> 08:20.820
Guy's got the big "C"
and he won't let it

08:20.908 --> 08:22.431
slow him down, despite the
toll it might take.

08:22.518 --> 08:23.468
Yeah.

08:23.556 --> 08:25.119
The man's a force of nature.

08:25.947 --> 08:27.376
I meant on Mac.

08:28.260 --> 08:31.072
Tell me, Papa Bear,
why should I help you?

08:31.302 --> 08:35.080
Because if you refuse, your visits
with your son will stop.

08:35.205 --> 08:37.892
And soon you'll become
nothing but someone.

08:37.980 --> 08:40.563
Cassian kind
of remembers.

08:40.652 --> 08:44.236
The irony of receiving
that threat from you.

08:44.626 --> 08:45.655
Wow.

08:45.845 --> 08:47.275
But you're forgetting
something.

08:47.556 --> 08:50.134
Guys, I've been locked
in a box.

08:50.327 --> 08:53.015
How could I possibly know
what Old Saint Nick's

08:53.103 --> 08:54.587
been up to, hmm?

08:54.807 --> 08:55.850
Well, he trained you.

08:55.938 --> 08:57.595
Taught you everything
that you know.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.359
So, you
can get into his head

08:59.447 --> 09:00.689
and tell us how he operates.

09:01.095 --> 09:02.415
It's like...

09:03.950 --> 09:07.017
You know, I'm really
short on patience these days.

09:07.322 --> 09:09.869
You've got three
seconds to say yes.

09:10.361 --> 09:12.265
- Three...
- Okay, okay, I'll help, I'll help.

09:12.353 --> 09:15.351
All right? Gosh. Relax.
Is he always this tense?

09:15.439 --> 09:18.267
Got to learn to enjoy
life more, Dad, okay?

09:19.683 --> 09:21.306
Okay. Here we go.

09:21.540 --> 09:24.235
Is this the only body
that he's dropped?

09:24.400 --> 09:25.556
That we know of.

09:25.673 --> 09:29.048
Why? Because allowing himself
to be captured on camera

09:29.150 --> 09:30.603
wasn't a mistake.

09:30.985 --> 09:32.869
<i>It was a calculated risk.</i>

09:32.957 --> 09:36.908
Yeah. Yeah.
I'll file the motions tomorrow.

09:37.032 --> 09:39.632
Don't worry.
I'm ready for trial.

09:41.217 --> 09:43.708
Obviously, I don't know exactly
what Helman's planning,

09:43.796 --> 09:45.124
but whatever it is,

09:46.632 --> 09:48.223
<i>Helman is willing to risk</i>

09:48.311 --> 09:51.389
<i>everything</i> to finish
what he started.

09:56.522 --> 09:57.686
...was right.

09:57.774 --> 09:59.665
Helman just committed
another murder.

09:59.753 --> 10:01.629
This time he killed
a federal prosecutor.

10:01.717 --> 10:03.387
Is there a connection
between the prosecutor

10:03.475 --> 10:05.645
and the FBI interrogator
at the karaoke bar?

10:05.733 --> 10:07.139
Yes.
This gentleman.

10:07.227 --> 10:08.866
His name is Alex Yee.

10:09.006 --> 10:11.794
Not too long ago he was
the number two shot caller

10:11.882 --> 10:13.106
in a San Francisco gang

10:13.194 --> 10:14.419
with strong ties

10:14.507 --> 10:16.272
to a Hong Kong
crime syndicate.

10:16.360 --> 10:18.069
- And now?
- The FBI flipped him.

10:18.157 --> 10:20.772
He's scheduled to testify
against his former colleagues

10:20.860 --> 10:22.772
to the grand jury
in less than a week.

10:22.860 --> 10:23.887
Let me guess.

10:23.975 --> 10:25.708
Helman's victims were the
guys who did the flipping.

10:25.796 --> 10:26.886
That's correct.

10:26.973 --> 10:28.956
Helman must've been hired
by the syndicate to take out

10:29.043 --> 10:31.132
- everyone working the case.
- No doubt Yee made that

10:31.220 --> 10:32.754
- hit list, too.
- Where's he now?

10:32.842 --> 10:34.936
In a safe house
outside San Francisco.

10:35.024 --> 10:36.786
But the FBI's prepping
to move him as we speak.

10:36.874 --> 10:37.944
They're upping security

10:38.032 --> 10:39.536
and taking him
to a federal holding pen

10:39.624 --> 10:40.865
two hours south of Oakland.

10:40.953 --> 10:42.717
Hel-loo...

10:42.852 --> 10:44.801
Not nice to talk about someone

10:44.889 --> 10:46.446
behind their one-way mirror.

10:46.533 --> 10:48.246
Or is two-way mirror?

10:48.333 --> 10:50.646
That nomenclature's
always confused me.

10:50.733 --> 10:53.483
Oh, MacGyvers!

10:57.707 --> 11:00.085
I knew you wouldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

11:00.173 --> 11:02.108
It's not in his
upbringing. Right, Dad?

11:02.311 --> 11:05.077
Look, you were right.
Helman killed again.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.811
Hmm. If you know anything
else that can help us

11:06.899 --> 11:10.612
- find Helman, now's the time.
- Again with that edge.

11:10.959 --> 11:11.996
You know, Pops,

11:12.116 --> 11:13.827
you're looking a
little off-color.

11:13.915 --> 11:16.375
- Everything okay?
- Shut up and answer the question.

11:16.463 --> 11:18.569
No, MacGyver,
I'm just making sure

11:18.657 --> 11:20.186
that Papa Bear is
feeling all right.

11:20.274 --> 11:21.850
How about you just...
Hey.

11:24.053 --> 11:26.600
I've got cancer, Murdoc.

11:29.287 --> 11:31.873
Doc gives me fifty-fifty shot.

11:34.988 --> 11:36.553
Oh.

11:37.105 --> 11:39.991
Just when you two
were finally building a bond.

11:40.472 --> 11:42.410
If I was staring down
my expiration date,

11:42.498 --> 11:43.975
I'd be sipping
margaritas on a beach

11:44.063 --> 11:45.457
instead of talking to
me in this hellhole,

11:45.545 --> 11:46.897
but, hey,
priorities, right?

11:46.985 --> 11:49.702
Quid pro quo,
Murdoc.

11:49.863 --> 11:52.131
Or are we wasting
our time?

11:54.986 --> 11:56.459
He doesn't know anything.

11:56.547 --> 11:59.358
In what city did
the killings take place?

12:00.849 --> 12:02.123
San Francisco.

12:02.211 --> 12:03.885
And what was the weapon
of choice?

12:03.973 --> 12:06.256
First poison, then an
eight-inch Bowie knife.

12:06.343 --> 12:08.202
It's so Jimmy O'Hara.

12:08.491 --> 12:09.903
- Who?
- Gus Swetnam.

12:09.991 --> 12:12.666
Alexei Kovac?
Sven Nordquist.

12:12.753 --> 12:14.037
And these are...?

12:14.125 --> 12:16.983
Some of Helman's aliases;
each one operates

12:17.083 --> 12:18.506
in a specific part
of the country

12:18.594 --> 12:20.477
- with a specific M.O.
- So, if the cops get

12:20.565 --> 12:23.184
on any of their trails,
they think it's a real person?

12:23.272 --> 12:24.592
See? Get Riley to do

12:24.680 --> 12:26.592
her typey-typey thing
with those names,

12:26.680 --> 12:28.006
and before you know it,

12:28.094 --> 12:30.295
you'll be knocking
on Helman's door.

12:40.213 --> 12:42.449
We got intel
that apartment 312 is leased

12:42.537 --> 12:44.153
under an alias
used by our target.

12:44.241 --> 12:46.106
Credit card activity
confirms he's been

12:46.194 --> 12:47.676
in this neighborhood
the last couple of days.

12:47.764 --> 12:49.772
Now we've all heard
how dangerous this guy is.

12:49.905 --> 12:51.069
So be ready.

12:51.157 --> 12:52.739
- We're in the building, Matty.
- Copy, Mac.

12:52.827 --> 12:55.246
We picked Helman up
on traffic cameras in the area,

12:55.334 --> 12:56.706
but that was hours ago.

12:56.793 --> 12:59.129
- We know if he's in the apartment now?
- Unfortunately, no.

12:59.217 --> 13:01.301
We don't have angles on all
the exits and entrances.

13:01.389 --> 13:02.725
You're going in blind.

13:06.849 --> 13:09.905
Go. Move, move, move.

13:11.073 --> 13:13.486
Dad.
What are you doing?

13:13.573 --> 13:15.780
I find that Kevlar is more
effective at stopping bullets

13:15.868 --> 13:18.014
if... worn properly.

13:18.133 --> 13:19.741
You don't need to go upstairs.

13:20.876 --> 13:22.311
I do.

13:25.515 --> 13:26.957
If you don't think
your dad can

13:27.045 --> 13:28.655
physically handle this,
say so.

13:29.061 --> 13:30.082
He's fine.

13:30.170 --> 13:31.366
He needs this right now.

13:31.454 --> 13:33.373
For once, I actually understand
what's going on in his head.

13:33.461 --> 13:34.598
So...

13:34.686 --> 13:36.416
This should not be
an emotional decision.

13:36.608 --> 13:39.035
- Lives are at stake.
- I know. And if it comes

13:39.123 --> 13:41.106
to that, I'll have a talk with
him, convince him to stand down.

13:41.194 --> 13:42.973
It's you
I'm worried about, Mac.

13:43.912 --> 13:45.543
Don't get distracted.

14:02.815 --> 14:04.026
Whoa.

14:04.200 --> 14:06.010
What the hell?

14:16.103 --> 14:18.426
Listen,
we've been over this many times.

14:18.513 --> 14:19.722
I have a way I do business,

14:19.810 --> 14:21.438
and I don't change that
for anyone.

14:21.526 --> 14:23.909
I don't care
who you think you are.

14:24.183 --> 14:25.266
On my mark...

14:25.846 --> 14:26.766
I haven't been

14:26.854 --> 14:29.157
to the movies
in so long.

14:29.245 --> 14:31.727
I'd kill for some popcorn.
Hint, hint.

14:32.533 --> 14:33.563
With Goobers

14:33.651 --> 14:35.776
and gummy bears mixed in...
Isn't that the best combo?

14:35.871 --> 14:37.884
Man, even your snacks are crazy.

14:38.112 --> 14:39.125
Five...

14:39.213 --> 14:40.617
<i>So, on a scale of one to ten,</i>

14:40.705 --> 14:42.486
how much do you like
the newbie?

14:42.574 --> 14:43.671
- <i>Four...</i>
- Why?

14:43.759 --> 14:45.316
'Cause, you know,
if you want to keep her,

14:45.403 --> 14:46.835
you may not want her
so close

14:46.923 --> 14:48.007
to Helman's door

14:48.095 --> 14:50.244
- when they breach.
- <i>Three...</i>

14:50.700 --> 14:51.900
<i>Two...</i>

14:52.128 --> 14:54.939
- Mac, abort! It's a trap.
- Wait, Desi, stop.

14:55.048 --> 14:56.096
Son, you just lost

14:56.183 --> 14:57.843
- the element of surprise.
- If Murdoc says it's

14:57.931 --> 15:00.062
booby-trapped, we can't risk it.
We need another way in.

15:00.150 --> 15:01.406
Riley? The apartment only has

15:01.494 --> 15:03.455
one window
and there's no fire escape.

15:03.543 --> 15:04.953
Yeah, we're three stories up;
that's not gonna

15:05.041 --> 15:06.377
- work for an entire tac team.
- Right, but

15:06.465 --> 15:08.750
it also means Helman isn't going
anywhere. I've got an idea.

15:08.838 --> 15:10.088
But first I got to borrow
something

15:10.176 --> 15:12.210
from these kids.
- I know I'm new here, but...

15:12.328 --> 15:14.111
borrow's in quotes, right?

15:42.933 --> 15:44.863
Move out. Go, go, go.

15:45.205 --> 15:47.417
Go. Move, move.

15:48.808 --> 15:50.040
Fan out.

15:50.128 --> 15:52.716
<i>- Secure the perimeter.
- Go, go.</i>

15:52.811 --> 15:54.714
<i>- Clear.
- Clear.</i>

15:55.403 --> 15:57.673
- We've been over this many times.
- <i>Clear.</i>

15:57.761 --> 15:59.856
I have a way I do business.

15:59.943 --> 16:01.426
And I don't change that for...

16:01.513 --> 16:04.449
- On a loop.
- Target's not on-site.

16:05.473 --> 16:07.480
So where's Helman?

16:08.948 --> 16:10.775
Oh. I am so sorry.

16:10.863 --> 16:12.431
No apologies necessary.

16:12.519 --> 16:14.449
I wasn't looking where I was standing.

16:14.823 --> 16:17.134
A-Am I wearing
your latte now?

16:17.222 --> 16:19.027
No, fortunately.

16:19.115 --> 16:22.222
Ah, good fortune is
mine today, apparently.

16:23.058 --> 16:24.347
I'll tell you what.

16:24.519 --> 16:28.251
If you truly feel bad
about barreling into me

16:28.339 --> 16:29.556
like a drunken sailor...

16:29.643 --> 16:31.516
...why don't you buy me
a cup of coffee?

16:31.603 --> 16:34.775
Oh, I'm sorry. I might have
given you the wrong impression.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.259
I'm actually married.

16:36.347 --> 16:39.066
Hmm. Well, I wouldn't be
here if you weren't.

16:39.878 --> 16:41.477
I don't understand.

16:44.042 --> 16:45.469
Don't make a scene.

16:45.566 --> 16:48.593
Say something, and
it'll end badly for you.

16:50.693 --> 16:53.546
We found weapons, IDs,
dozens of credit cards

16:53.633 --> 16:55.616
matching aliases
that Murdoc gave us,

16:55.730 --> 16:56.824
and that laptop.

16:56.912 --> 16:58.625
But nothing indicating
where he might be.

16:58.803 --> 17:00.658
All right, Riley,
I am connecting you

17:00.746 --> 17:02.386
to Helman's laptop.

17:02.559 --> 17:04.160
What do you see?

17:05.664 --> 17:08.041
Helman's no slouch
when it comes to security.

17:08.207 --> 17:09.689
The encryption he's using

17:09.777 --> 17:10.695
is top of the line.

17:10.782 --> 17:13.493
AES, 256-bit, symmetric key.

17:13.582 --> 17:14.743
Okay, how long will
it take you

17:14.832 --> 17:16.082
- to get...
- Done.

17:18.553 --> 17:20.760
Starting with the files
most recently opened,

17:20.848 --> 17:22.700
I've got photos
and daily schedules

17:22.809 --> 17:26.182
on both victims and...
bank transfer confirmation

17:26.270 --> 17:28.106
- in a third-party messaging app.
- Helman received

17:28.194 --> 17:30.918
$10 million
a month before the murders.

17:31.006 --> 17:32.541
That's got to be
the Hong Kong syndicate

17:32.629 --> 17:34.433
hiring him to take out Yee.

17:34.596 --> 17:37.067
Riley,
what's that file?

17:39.878 --> 17:41.182
We have a big problem.

17:41.270 --> 17:42.916
- What is it, Matty?
- Helman has the secret

17:43.004 --> 17:44.346
FBI transport routes

17:44.434 --> 17:46.494
from Yee's safe house
to federal holding.

17:46.582 --> 17:48.590
He knew dropping the first two
bodies would make the Feds

17:48.678 --> 17:50.330
- move Yee.
- Helman couldn't attack

17:50.418 --> 17:52.364
the safe house,
so he tricked the Feds

17:52.452 --> 17:54.715
into moving the witness.
Helman's gonna hit the transport.

17:54.871 --> 17:57.059
And we played
right into his hands.

18:03.137 --> 18:05.637
All right, we are 15 minutes out
from intercepting the transport.

18:05.743 --> 18:08.395
Director Webber, did you get
our warning to the FBI?

18:08.485 --> 18:10.395
I did, but they won't
alter their route.

18:10.483 --> 18:12.739
The primary is the quickest way
to the federal holding pen.

18:12.827 --> 18:14.559
And given it's already been
cleared of traffic,

18:14.647 --> 18:16.713
the Feds think their best chance
of delivering Yee alive

18:16.801 --> 18:18.612
is to maintain
their speed and heading.

18:18.700 --> 18:19.848
That makes sense.
For all we know,

18:19.936 --> 18:21.510
Helman has someone
inside the FBI

18:21.598 --> 18:23.406
giving him info
in real time.

18:23.493 --> 18:25.786
This nutbag always seems
to be one step ahead of us.

18:25.874 --> 18:27.778
We need to be the variable
that he didn't account for.

18:27.866 --> 18:30.168
Agreed, but if we don't figure out
where Helman is intercepting

18:30.256 --> 18:32.629
the transport, then we won't
even factor into the equation.

18:32.770 --> 18:34.080
Well, Bozer's questioning

18:34.168 --> 18:36.487
our in-house psychopath
as we speak.

18:36.575 --> 18:38.582
Hopefully he'll have
the answers we need.

18:38.743 --> 18:41.830
You might as well ask me
how Picasso painted.

18:41.918 --> 18:44.684
I mean, if predicting
the process of an <i> artiste</i>

18:44.772 --> 18:47.534
like Helman were easy,
he'd already be in custody.

18:47.622 --> 18:49.622
- Or dead for reals.
- Murdoc,

18:49.710 --> 18:52.495
if you can't or won't help,
just say so.

18:52.583 --> 18:53.801
- And I'll make sure...
- Oh, make sure

18:53.889 --> 18:55.372
that I never see
Cassian again?

18:55.460 --> 18:57.143
You're so one-note, Wilt.

18:57.269 --> 18:58.942
Does Leanna ever tell you that?

18:59.036 --> 19:00.189
Oh, by the by,

19:00.277 --> 19:02.916
how are things between
you little love muffins?

19:03.004 --> 19:04.246
I'm gonna give you

19:04.333 --> 19:05.948
five seconds to say
something of value.

19:06.036 --> 19:07.893
- Otherwise, I'm gonna go...
- Shu...

19:07.981 --> 19:10.877
Okay, get the Double Macs
on the horn.

19:10.965 --> 19:13.504
I'm ready to dazzle them.

19:14.955 --> 19:16.568
- Mac.
- Bozer?

19:16.656 --> 19:19.034
Hey-hey! Howdy,
Scooby Gang.

19:19.122 --> 19:20.598
How goes the road trip?

19:20.686 --> 19:23.596
I'm trying not to be hurt that
I was left out of all the fun.

19:23.684 --> 19:26.637
Although it is nice to get
some real QT with Wilt.

19:26.868 --> 19:29.504
Just get to the point, Murdoc.

19:29.592 --> 19:31.653
Your tensions
are running high in there.

19:31.749 --> 19:34.102
So I'll jump right in, mm-kay?

19:34.629 --> 19:37.463
Looking at the FBI route,
looks like there's

19:37.551 --> 19:40.606
an open stretch of highway
around the 30-mile marker.

19:41.473 --> 19:42.446
Got it.

19:42.533 --> 19:43.686
If I'm Helman,

19:43.773 --> 19:45.840
that's my strike zone.

19:46.412 --> 19:48.785
Yeah, I'm not feeling it.

19:49.045 --> 19:51.145
- Boss?
- Me neither.

19:51.254 --> 19:52.396
Helman's too smart for that.

19:52.483 --> 19:53.496
He's not the type

19:53.583 --> 19:55.387
to risk an assault
from such an open position.

19:55.475 --> 19:57.159
I hate to say this, but...

19:57.247 --> 19:59.166
Murdoc's been right so far.

19:59.285 --> 20:00.364
About everything.

20:00.452 --> 20:01.981
If we're making
a calculated guess...

20:02.069 --> 20:03.877
I say we roll the dice
with him again.

20:03.965 --> 20:05.645
Aw, Angus.

20:05.778 --> 20:07.473
I'm feeling the love.

20:07.628 --> 20:09.945
- Why didn't we ever hug it out?
- So that your hands could

20:10.033 --> 20:12.016
- end up around my throat?
- Yeah, well, there's that.

20:12.103 --> 20:14.316
Proceed to
the 30-mile marker.

20:14.403 --> 20:18.075
As per
Murdoc's suggestion.

20:18.231 --> 20:21.840
"As per Murdoc's suggestion."
Did you hear that?

20:24.702 --> 20:26.755
Secure the perimeter.

20:30.485 --> 20:32.654
I want two vehicles
to front and follow

20:32.742 --> 20:34.484
the FBI transport
the moment it arrives.

20:35.282 --> 20:36.935
Transport is one minute out.

20:37.023 --> 20:38.066
Hey, Mac,

20:38.154 --> 20:39.657
I got
an unidentified vehicle

20:39.745 --> 20:41.075
closing fast
on your position

20:41.163 --> 20:42.946
from the opposite direction
of the transport.

20:43.034 --> 20:45.180
This could be Helman.

20:45.854 --> 20:47.484
You've got less
than a minute.

20:48.373 --> 20:50.716
It appears to be a delivery van.

20:50.803 --> 20:52.016
Driver's wearing a hat.

20:52.103 --> 20:53.286
Sun's banging off
the windshield.

20:53.373 --> 20:54.602
I can't confirm it's Helman.

20:54.690 --> 20:57.141
If that van is full
of explosives, we need

20:57.229 --> 20:59.889
to find a way to stop him
before he gets any closer.

21:02.113 --> 21:04.166
May I borrow that rifle?

21:04.253 --> 21:05.537
Yes, sir.

21:21.103 --> 21:22.103
Go, go.

21:26.303 --> 21:27.386
Hands. Hands.

21:27.473 --> 21:29.086
Get out of the car.
Get out of the car.

21:29.173 --> 21:31.699
On your knees. Keep your hands up.

21:31.787 --> 21:34.150
I was told
to make a delivery to this spot.

21:34.238 --> 21:36.012
I was paid extra
to be on time.

21:36.100 --> 21:38.363
- I-I was late, that's why I was speeding!
- What's in the van?

21:38.451 --> 21:40.426
I-I don't know.
I-I did't load it.

21:40.514 --> 21:42.144
Please don't shoot me.

21:43.660 --> 21:45.373
Keep your hands up.

21:45.593 --> 21:47.323
Go ahead.

21:55.992 --> 21:58.799
FBI transport's
reaching you now.

21:59.943 --> 22:02.613
Teams one and
two, fall in, fall in!

22:04.383 --> 22:07.206
Those balloons were from Helman.
What the hell is he up to?

22:18.063 --> 22:21.346
Jenna. What's this?
I wasn't expecting you till later.

22:21.480 --> 22:23.517
Got called in early
to bring this transfer in.

22:23.605 --> 22:25.646
- You get the notice?
- No.

22:25.733 --> 22:27.550
I'm gonna have to call this in.
Just stay right there.

22:27.638 --> 22:29.392
Hey, same team.

22:29.480 --> 22:30.628
But no problem.

22:30.716 --> 22:32.586
Do what you got to do.

22:38.111 --> 22:40.081
You said that if I let you in...

22:41.113 --> 22:43.453
...you would let my husband go.

22:46.091 --> 22:47.508
I lied.

23:03.922 --> 23:05.482
Hello, Dennis.

23:06.315 --> 23:07.738
<i>DJ Nick here,</i>

23:07.826 --> 23:10.797
<i>locked and loaded and ready
to rock your cell block.</i>

23:10.943 --> 23:15.370
<i>All remaining Phoenix personnel,
feel free to sit this dance out,</i>

23:15.458 --> 23:16.596
<i>because the next jam</i>

23:16.683 --> 23:19.711
is dedicated to the grease stain

23:20.034 --> 23:22.656
who murdered my beloved wife.

23:22.853 --> 23:26.576
This is
our spotlight tango, Dennis.

23:27.906 --> 23:29.946
Be killing you soon.

23:30.826 --> 23:33.093
Got to hand it to the old guy.

23:33.363 --> 23:35.906
He never disappoints.

23:38.302 --> 23:39.255
Mac,

23:39.343 --> 23:40.929
Helman's here.

23:41.017 --> 23:42.552
Boze? Helman is where?

23:42.640 --> 23:43.966
At the black site.

23:44.054 --> 23:45.456
We have a breach.
Bozer, talk to me.

23:45.543 --> 23:46.726
What's go...

23:46.814 --> 23:47.857
Hello?

23:48.183 --> 23:49.766
- Mac.
<i>- Is this really happening?</i>

23:49.853 --> 23:51.036
Yeah, it is,

23:51.123 --> 23:52.366
and I can't do
anything to stop it.

23:52.453 --> 23:53.835
Helman's locked me out.

23:56.452 --> 23:58.630
Stay where you are.
Everything about the FBI case...

23:58.718 --> 23:59.857
The murders, the
supposed attack

23:59.945 --> 24:01.546
on the transport...
It was all a ruse.

24:01.633 --> 24:03.591
He moved us around
the board like chess pieces,

24:03.679 --> 24:05.513
lured us hundreds of miles
out of position.

24:05.601 --> 24:07.380
Murdoc's been Helman's target
the whole time,

24:07.468 --> 24:09.265
and we left Bozer
in the line of fire.

24:16.603 --> 24:18.114
Guys, what's your ETA?

24:18.202 --> 24:19.232
We'll be there in 20.

24:19.320 --> 24:20.497
That's not fast enough.

24:20.585 --> 24:21.560
Riley, I can't get through.

24:21.648 --> 24:23.356
- Any luck reaching Bozer?
- Not yet.

24:23.443 --> 24:25.505
The black site's communications
are still out.

24:25.593 --> 24:27.747
I don't think I'll be able
to get it back up any time soon.

24:27.835 --> 24:29.866
What I don't understand
is, how did Helman ID

24:29.953 --> 24:31.827
the guard who walked him
into the facility?

24:31.984 --> 24:34.278
All black site personnel
have SCI-level clearance.

24:34.450 --> 24:36.176
And if the $10 million
that was transferred

24:36.273 --> 24:38.243
into Helman's account
was for killing Murdoc,

24:38.331 --> 24:40.729
not Yee,
then who hired him?

24:41.760 --> 24:44.627
Someone who knew we had Murdoc
at the black site.

24:44.968 --> 24:47.568
And that's a very,
very short list.

24:54.924 --> 24:56.555
Get back in that cell.

24:56.643 --> 24:59.696
Don't have to tell me twice.

25:01.783 --> 25:03.326
You hear
those bangs, Wilt?

25:03.413 --> 25:04.896
Those are the melodic bass notes

25:04.983 --> 25:06.750
of Helman's
Franchi SPAS-12 shotgun

25:06.838 --> 25:08.461
beating a bloody path
to my doorstep.

25:08.549 --> 25:10.813
Now's not the time to impress me
with fancy gun names.

25:10.901 --> 25:12.376
Look, with
all due respect

25:12.463 --> 25:15.246
to the strategic expertise of
Guard Number 7 in the hall,

25:15.333 --> 25:19.307
staying put is a
supremely bad idea.

25:26.252 --> 25:27.427
<i>Get him out of here!</i>

25:27.515 --> 25:28.932
<i>Return fire!</i>

25:29.027 --> 25:30.170
<i>Behind you!</i>

25:30.273 --> 25:32.557
I'm glad we moved past
the sitting duck stage.

25:32.645 --> 25:34.868
We're gonna need
some major firepower

25:34.956 --> 25:36.566
if we're gonna,
I don't know, survive.

25:36.653 --> 25:38.336
Now you want me
to give you a gun, too?

25:38.423 --> 25:39.796
Only if you want
to keep breathing.

25:39.883 --> 25:42.164
Tempting, but no chance in hell.

25:42.252 --> 25:43.620
What's the plan?

25:44.793 --> 25:46.721
Regroup, regroup, regroup!

25:46.993 --> 25:48.120
Still working on it.

25:48.274 --> 25:50.112
Follow me.

25:51.903 --> 25:53.073
Ooh, boy.

25:53.161 --> 25:56.331
Old Nick is still at it,
hasn't lost a step.

25:56.503 --> 25:58.307
Sure you don't want
an extra set of hands

25:58.395 --> 26:01.588
for when my good friend shows
up? And he will soon.

26:01.676 --> 26:04.325
Look, I may be on the verge
of a nervous breakdown, Murdoc,

26:04.413 --> 26:06.914
but I can still do math, and
I know that one armed psychopath

26:07.002 --> 26:08.149
is better than two.

26:08.237 --> 26:11.034
Agree to disagree.
So, what's the plan, Capitan?

26:11.243 --> 26:14.362
Okay, we're gonna go
through that door...

26:16.693 --> 26:18.807
Come on.
Let's get you out of here.

26:19.648 --> 26:20.908
Come on, come on.

26:40.149 --> 26:43.095
Murdoc, we need
something to block the door.

26:43.183 --> 26:45.596
And then what? Come on,
Wilt, we're in this together.

26:45.683 --> 26:47.741
It's Waterloo time, Wilt.

26:47.829 --> 26:49.601
Like it or not, our
fates are intertwined.

26:49.689 --> 26:51.374
So, unless you want
us to both be buried

26:51.462 --> 26:55.931
on the same day,
let me off the leash, okay?

26:56.933 --> 26:58.415
Come on.

27:02.403 --> 27:04.316
All right.

27:07.143 --> 27:09.003
Oh, that feels nice.

27:09.238 --> 27:10.924
Just kidding.

27:14.283 --> 27:15.826
How much longer?

27:15.913 --> 27:19.385
We'll touch down on the black
site's roof in five minutes.

28:03.103 --> 28:06.164
I've been waiting so long
for this, Dennis,

28:06.252 --> 28:10.213
willing myself to live
long enough to pay you back.

28:10.408 --> 28:14.164
I can only imagine how you felt
when you opened that e-mail

28:14.252 --> 28:16.286
hiring you to kill me.

28:16.494 --> 28:18.031
Like Christmas morning

28:18.119 --> 28:21.721
and my birthday
all rolled into one.

28:21.818 --> 28:24.172
You're so excited,
you didn't even stop to wonder

28:24.260 --> 28:26.296
how someone managed to find me.

28:26.383 --> 28:30.096
I got ten million reasons
not to care how.

28:30.721 --> 28:31.859
I was finally

28:31.947 --> 28:34.799
gonna get to turn you
into a corpse.

28:35.145 --> 28:38.175
The rest is
just background noise.

28:46.743 --> 28:48.656
Matty, you're not
gonna believe this.

28:48.743 --> 28:50.586
I found the computer that sent
Helman's $10 million

28:50.673 --> 28:53.350
payment a month ago
to kill Murdoc.

28:53.686 --> 28:54.926
It's in the black site.

28:55.013 --> 28:56.295
What?

28:56.383 --> 28:58.326
- How is that even possible?
- I don't know.

28:58.504 --> 29:00.340
<i>Wasn't Cassian's last visit</i>

29:00.428 --> 29:02.444
- to the black site a month ago?
- Yes.

29:02.733 --> 29:04.522
Now, I'm just getting
to know this family.

29:04.610 --> 29:05.636
Just to be clear,

29:05.723 --> 29:07.223
we're not suggesting
that Cassian

29:07.311 --> 29:09.276
hired a hit man
to take out his father, right?

29:09.363 --> 29:12.263
No. Murdoc.

29:14.839 --> 29:16.881
It was Murdoc who hired Helman.

29:21.988 --> 29:23.985
I hired you. Yeah, see,

29:24.073 --> 29:26.061
I brought you here

29:26.194 --> 29:28.326
to finish you once and for all,

29:28.413 --> 29:30.666
and to use you
as a key to unlock

29:30.753 --> 29:32.666
all the doors
that I knew I couldn't.

29:32.753 --> 29:36.266
So thank you, Nick, for
giving me my freedom.

29:36.353 --> 29:37.813
Now...

29:37.901 --> 29:40.258
I'm gonna give you yours.

29:46.074 --> 29:49.727
You've always been ahead
of yourself, Dennis.

29:50.001 --> 29:54.461
I do hope you enjoy this
as much as I will.

30:01.983 --> 30:06.366
Double-oh-Boze: one,
world's greatest assassin: zero.

30:06.453 --> 30:08.587
World's greatest? Him?

30:08.927 --> 30:10.640
That's just hurtful, Bozer.
Man, shut up

30:10.765 --> 30:12.605
and find me something
to restrain him with.

30:18.163 --> 30:20.346
That's a nasty
shoulder wound, buddy.

30:20.433 --> 30:22.146
I've never seen
Helman miss before.

30:22.233 --> 30:24.633
Yeah, lucky me.

30:29.113 --> 30:31.377
And you're welcome, Murdoc.

30:31.465 --> 30:32.778
Yes.

30:33.113 --> 30:35.043
Thank you, Wilt.

30:37.534 --> 30:38.774
Hmm.

30:48.701 --> 30:51.313
Just hurry up
and get it over with.

30:51.512 --> 30:53.532
I'm not gonna kill you.

30:55.050 --> 30:56.780
You're not?

30:58.017 --> 30:59.686
I'm not. See,

31:00.399 --> 31:01.657
I knew Nick

31:01.973 --> 31:04.546
would find the black site,
carve a path,

31:04.634 --> 31:06.226
let me walk right out
the front door,

31:06.313 --> 31:09.396
but what I didn't anticipate
was the silver fox

31:09.483 --> 31:12.321
getting the better of me
mano a mano.

31:12.454 --> 31:16.421
You are the only reason
he didn't send me

31:16.509 --> 31:18.421
to my great reward,

31:18.509 --> 31:20.106
so to pay you back,

31:20.240 --> 31:22.345
I'm going to let you live.

31:27.325 --> 31:29.945
You know,
I think it's poetic justice

31:30.033 --> 31:32.188
to let Nick live out
the rest of his days

31:32.276 --> 31:34.867
down in this sunless box
where I've suffered,

31:34.955 --> 31:36.956
so you could see
to that,

31:37.043 --> 31:38.113
won't you?

31:45.483 --> 31:47.450
But why would Murdoc hire.

31:47.565 --> 31:49.848
Helman to kill Murdoc?

31:49.936 --> 31:52.260
Because he knew that Helman
would do anything it took

31:52.348 --> 31:53.906
to find and attack
the black site

31:53.993 --> 31:55.778
if he used himself as bait.

31:57.433 --> 31:59.516
Wait a second.

31:59.604 --> 32:01.047
This wasn't a hit.

32:01.312 --> 32:03.235
It was a jailbreak.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.973
Ooh, we got a little birdie.

32:21.906 --> 32:23.721
I have a visual on Murdoc,

32:23.809 --> 32:25.341
<i>heading west on route 29.</i>

32:25.429 --> 32:27.833
<i>Mac and Oversight
are in ground pursuit.</i>

32:30.843 --> 32:32.726
- How's Bozer?
- He's getting patched up.

32:32.813 --> 32:34.996
He took a blast of buckshot
to the shoulder and he's

32:35.083 --> 32:37.496
- got a concussion, but he'll be okay.
- And we have Helman in custody.

32:37.583 --> 32:39.336
That leaves just
one last lunatic

32:39.423 --> 32:41.645
to put back in an asylum.

32:48.035 --> 32:49.692
Come on.

33:00.348 --> 33:03.216
It's two-for-one night
on MacGyvers. Come on.

33:03.385 --> 33:04.855
All right?

33:08.249 --> 33:09.761
Come on, Daddy.

33:15.523 --> 33:17.336
Yeah, your aim's about as good
as your driving.

33:17.423 --> 33:19.493
Ah!

33:26.767 --> 33:28.074
PIT him.

33:33.525 --> 33:34.977
California drivers.

33:35.065 --> 33:36.313
Hey, uh, I don't think
I'm gonna be able

33:36.401 --> 33:37.532
to force that thing
off the road.

33:37.620 --> 33:38.926
There's a winch

33:39.013 --> 33:40.626
and a tow hook
on the front of this.

33:40.713 --> 33:43.127
- It could be used as an anchor line.
- Then we can use

33:43.215 --> 33:45.011
the weight of this vehicle
to bring his to a stop.

33:45.099 --> 33:46.316
It's a great idea.

33:46.652 --> 33:48.002
Hold on.

33:50.823 --> 33:52.075
H-Hold on, Dad,

33:52.163 --> 33:54.754
I don't think that you
should be the one doing that.

33:58.413 --> 34:00.853
All right. You're right, son.
I'll take the wheel.

34:06.513 --> 34:07.513
Now what are you doing?

34:15.253 --> 34:16.313
Ready!

34:23.223 --> 34:24.353
Hold on.

34:28.293 --> 34:30.815
Sorry, son.
You got this.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.203
Come on, Boy Scout.

34:41.873 --> 34:42.926
Nicely done.

34:43.013 --> 34:45.656
I can't believe I'm saying this
to my best bud.

34:45.743 --> 34:47.313
Right now you're being
so annoying!

34:50.953 --> 34:53.706
Well, you could still pull over.
Oh, please.

34:53.793 --> 34:55.293
Now!

35:20.253 --> 35:22.536
Don't make me go
back there, Angus.

35:22.731 --> 35:26.236
Anywhere but there.
How about, um, Leavenworth?

35:26.323 --> 35:27.766
Or, um, I heard
that Rikers Island

35:27.853 --> 35:29.876
is very nice this time
of year. I'll be good.

35:29.963 --> 35:31.276
I promise.

35:31.363 --> 35:32.876
Hi, Dad.

35:32.963 --> 35:34.893
Hi, nutbag.

35:53.522 --> 35:55.579
- You okay?
- Yeah, well,

35:55.667 --> 35:57.666
I'll be feeling it tomorrow.

35:57.947 --> 35:59.689
Better you than me.

36:06.267 --> 36:08.476
Thank you, son.

36:08.735 --> 36:10.363
For what?

36:13.036 --> 36:14.493
Being my son.

36:25.454 --> 36:26.765
Thank you.

36:26.853 --> 36:28.796
Thank you,
thank you.

36:28.883 --> 36:30.136
But I got to admit,

36:30.223 --> 36:34.136
being a hero hurts a lot,
like way too much.

36:34.223 --> 36:37.976
Nice job taking down Helman,
Bozer. I am very proud of you.

36:38.063 --> 36:39.476
All in a day's work.

36:39.563 --> 36:41.876
Though, if I'm
being honest,

36:42.017 --> 36:45.446
it was above and beyond.
Any chance you got me in line

36:45.533 --> 36:47.876
- for a pay bump, Matty?
- Don't get carried away, Bozer.

36:48.712 --> 36:50.415
Nothing but
good news here.

36:50.503 --> 36:53.429
Alex Yee delivered his testimony
to the grand jury,

36:53.517 --> 36:54.710
and indictments

36:54.798 --> 36:56.124
against the Hong Kong
crime syndicate

36:56.212 --> 36:57.726
will be handed down shortly.

36:57.814 --> 36:59.601
As for our black
site, I've suggested

36:59.689 --> 37:01.546
a number of security upgrades
to make sure nothing

37:01.634 --> 37:04.421
like Murdoc's escape or Helman's
attack ever happens again.

37:04.509 --> 37:06.452
Do we have
any idea how Murdoc

37:06.540 --> 37:08.118
even knew Helman
was still alive?

37:08.206 --> 37:10.142
We asked
our favorite psychopath,

37:10.230 --> 37:12.613
but he hasn't exactly been
forthcoming.

37:12.900 --> 37:14.915
So, we decided what Murdoc's
punishment will be?

37:15.003 --> 37:16.439
I mean, we're not just
turning the page

37:16.527 --> 37:18.702
- like nothing happened, right?
- Oh, no.

37:18.790 --> 37:21.048
Murdoc will be punished.

37:25.773 --> 37:29.226
Mm, looks great, fellas,

37:29.540 --> 37:32.996
but couldn't you have gone
for more color on the walls?

37:33.083 --> 37:35.496
I don't know, brighten up
your little black site

37:35.583 --> 37:39.536
with a seafoam green
or azure blue?

37:39.623 --> 37:41.136
C'est la vie.

37:41.223 --> 37:44.553
You'll be back soon,
won't you, MacGyvers?

37:44.663 --> 37:46.923
You know, I think
where we went wrong

37:47.011 --> 37:50.399
was a lack of communication,
but some social interaction

37:50.487 --> 37:53.149
with my intellectual peers
will help, you know,

37:53.237 --> 37:54.383
keep me grounded.

37:54.471 --> 37:56.126
You bit the hand
that feeds you, Murdoc.

37:56.214 --> 37:58.440
I don't think we're gonna
be back any time soon.

37:58.753 --> 38:00.743
And neither
will Cassian.

38:04.425 --> 38:07.563
Life is cruel,
so are the people in it,

38:07.651 --> 38:10.136
but you'll be back
as soon as the next psycho

38:10.223 --> 38:13.284
comes a-frolicking down
the butcher path.

38:13.487 --> 38:16.149
As it turns out, your expertise
isn't quite as unique

38:16.237 --> 38:17.573
as you might have thought.

38:17.706 --> 38:19.987
What's that supposed to mean?

38:20.075 --> 38:22.270
Well, let's just say
we understand

38:22.493 --> 38:23.746
how hard it's been on you

38:23.833 --> 38:26.116
to be kept here
in almost total isolation,

38:26.203 --> 38:28.739
so we added a little
something special

38:28.869 --> 38:30.352
to help you pass the time.

38:30.454 --> 38:33.437
Ooh, you're so mysterious,
Daddy Mac.

38:33.673 --> 38:35.848
What could it be? A TV?

38:35.972 --> 38:38.329
Paint set?
I do fancy myself

38:38.417 --> 38:41.300
quite the Bob Ross protégé.

38:46.806 --> 38:48.613
Good morning, Dennis.

38:48.972 --> 38:53.361
I'm so looking forward to
spending lots of quality time

38:53.449 --> 38:55.988
- with you.
- Is this a joke?

38:56.646 --> 38:58.347
Get back here, MacGyver.

38:58.435 --> 38:59.623
Daddy Mac?

38:59.711 --> 39:02.654
No, no, no, no, no.
This is cruel and unusual.

Agent Nguyen.

39:24.563 --> 39:25.992
Boss.

39:26.367 --> 39:27.976
You come to
check up on us?

39:28.195 --> 39:30.376
I had to make sure
for myself that Hellspawn

39:30.463 --> 39:33.086
and his kooky protégé were
buttoned up good and tight.

39:33.173 --> 39:34.539
That they are.

39:35.649 --> 39:37.211
You okay?

39:38.540 --> 39:40.753
All things considered, yeah.

39:40.980 --> 39:42.450
Good to hear.

39:44.500 --> 39:46.156
See you tomorrow.

39:46.243 --> 39:47.566
Uh, Desi...

39:47.890 --> 39:50.125
Something you need?
Something I wanted to say.

39:50.229 --> 39:51.389
Yeah.

39:53.226 --> 39:56.469
Jack was the best agent
I'd ever worked with.

39:56.984 --> 39:58.876
He always watched my back,

39:58.963 --> 40:01.546
and him doing his job
made it easier to do mine.

40:01.633 --> 40:04.162
Those aren't shoes that any
one person should have to fill,

40:04.250 --> 40:06.523
but I wanted to tell you
that you're doing a great job.

40:06.875 --> 40:09.828
Thank you. I appreciate that.

40:12.890 --> 40:14.386
- I'm gonna head to Phoenix. - Yeah.

40:14.473 --> 40:16.437
- I was gonna drive my dad, so...
- Yeah, cool.

40:22.358 --> 40:23.611
That was
Director Webber.

40:23.699 --> 40:26.133
I cleared our schedule
for the rest of the day.

40:26.789 --> 40:28.209
It's beautiful out.

40:28.297 --> 40:31.092
I figured we could spend
the afternoon together, or...

40:31.180 --> 40:33.435
Yeah, absolutely.
What are we gonna do?

40:33.523 --> 40:35.062
We could take
a nature hike.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.820
Or we could try and finish
that superconductor

40:37.908 --> 40:38.846
- you've beenworking on.
- No, no.

40:38.933 --> 40:40.896
I was gonna say we're actually
really close to Trout Lake.

40:40.984 --> 40:44.263
And I heard the algae bloom is
excessively large this year, so

40:44.351 --> 40:45.523
maybe we could take
some samples...

40:45.611 --> 40:49.094
We could, uh, skip the algae
and just go fishing.

40:49.656 --> 40:53.140
Ri-Right.
Uncomplicated.

40:53.953 --> 40:56.426
You know, the last time
we went fishing together,

40:56.513 --> 40:58.496
I wasn't old enough
to drink beer.

40:59.398 --> 41:02.336
Mm, which is pretty much
the best part of fishing.

41:02.517 --> 41:03.945
Sold.
