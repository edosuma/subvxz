00:14.648 --> 00:17.751
*

00:34.435 --> 00:35.703
Hey, David...

00:35.736 --> 00:37.371
anything from anywhere?

00:37.405 --> 00:39.607
Been two minutes
since your last call.

00:39.640 --> 00:40.708
No.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.343
Are you chewing gum?

00:42.376 --> 00:44.378
Oh, it's just that

00:44.412 --> 00:45.646
I started with math
that I used

00:45.679 --> 00:47.515
for those bank robberies
a few years back.

00:47.548 --> 00:48.782
Remember the Charm School Boys?

00:48.816 --> 00:49.983
Right.

00:50.017 --> 00:51.819
AMITA: See, normally, these
kinds of projections require

00:51.852 --> 00:54.155
sifting through tens
of thousands of data points

00:54.188 --> 00:56.090
to divine deep patterns.
-Right, and this time

00:56.124 --> 00:57.158
the patterns were overwhelming,

00:57.191 --> 00:59.393
like a giant neon arrow
pointing at the next job.

00:59.427 --> 01:03.297
If your numbers say it will
happen here, I'm sold, Charlie.

01:03.331 --> 01:05.399
Well, that's the thing.

01:05.433 --> 01:08.169
Uh, they don't say
it'll happen there.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.437
What?

01:09.470 --> 01:10.704
AMITA:
I pointed out to Charlie

01:10.738 --> 01:12.640
the big arrow was pointing
directly away

01:12.673 --> 01:14.408
from the Charm School Boys'
original target--

01:14.442 --> 01:16.410
the Federal Reserve shipments
of old cash.

01:16.444 --> 01:17.478
CHARLIE:
And so, then I asked myself--

01:17.511 --> 01:18.846
what if the new robbers

01:18.879 --> 01:20.414
had studied
the old robbers' tactics?

01:20.448 --> 01:21.649
Could it be at all possible

01:21.682 --> 01:24.418
that they were anticipating
our methodology-- choosing banks

01:24.452 --> 01:25.486
specifically to divert
our attention

01:25.519 --> 01:27.288
away from the real target?

01:27.321 --> 01:29.290
Are you saying we're here
on a hunch?

01:29.323 --> 01:32.460
Oh, I-I wouldn't call it
a-a-a hunch.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.162
(whispering): It's an
induction. -It's an induction.

01:34.195 --> 01:35.563
Thank you.
It's an induction.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.564
DAVID:
So this whole stakeout

01:36.597 --> 01:38.566
hinges on evidence
that basically guarantees

01:38.599 --> 01:40.268
we're going to fail?

01:40.301 --> 01:42.270
I'm just talking it
through here, David, and I

01:42.303 --> 01:44.305
feel 90% better.

01:44.338 --> 01:45.639
You know, I... I'm just curious,

01:45.673 --> 01:47.308
but where does your equation
indicate

01:47.341 --> 01:49.410
the crew will hit?

01:49.443 --> 01:52.480
You haven't heard anything
from Ventura County, have you?

01:52.513 --> 01:54.415
(whispering):
I doubt it.

01:57.851 --> 02:00.188
(tires squealing)

02:00.221 --> 02:01.289
Incoming!

02:02.690 --> 02:04.625
(tires squealing)

02:08.429 --> 02:09.763
(man coughing)

02:09.797 --> 02:11.365
(Taser crackling)

02:11.399 --> 02:12.466
FBI!

02:17.505 --> 02:20.208
(indistinct shouting)

02:33.421 --> 02:35.323
(indistinct shouting)

02:37.958 --> 02:39.360
(man groans)

02:44.498 --> 02:45.399
Don't move.

02:45.433 --> 02:48.302
(garbled radio transmission)

02:48.336 --> 02:50.704
(coughs)

02:50.738 --> 02:52.540
NIKKI: I don't know
about the outfit, boss.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.375
You kind of look
like a Eagle Scout.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.344
Be prepared.

02:57.911 --> 03:00.414
(garbled radio transmission)

03:01.849 --> 03:03.984
ANCHORWOMAN:
A wild scene downtown today,

03:04.017 --> 03:07.321
as FBI agents thwarted robbers
wielding Tasers, tear gas

03:07.355 --> 03:08.522
and machine guns.

03:08.556 --> 03:12.393
Hospitalized for tear gas
inhalation and minor injuries

03:12.426 --> 03:14.562
was the armored car's driver,
Wesley Till,

03:14.595 --> 03:16.530
35, of Topanga Canyon...
-Next time,

03:16.564 --> 03:19.633
uh, be sure to, uh,
induct the tear gas, huh?

03:19.667 --> 03:21.502
AMITA:
Wow.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.671
Imagine the research
this could fund.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.339
Yeah, that's exactly
what I was imagining.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.577
(beeping)
-Another old one.

03:29.610 --> 03:32.713
Something about old bills
this machine does not like.

03:34.948 --> 03:35.949
1969.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.351
The average lifespan

03:37.385 --> 03:39.720
of a $20 bill is two years.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.555
This one made it up to 40.

03:41.589 --> 03:42.656
Well, put it in the pile.

03:42.690 --> 03:43.891
Machine jammers
get counted separately.

03:43.924 --> 03:46.560
AMITA:
There are three more here.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.829
All 1969 20s.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.831
There are four in one bag?

03:50.864 --> 03:53.534
Do you guys realize
what the odds are here?

03:53.567 --> 03:55.536
No, but I'm guessing
we're about to find out.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.539
CHARLIE: Even factoring in the
superannuated nature of bills

03:58.572 --> 04:01.609
being sent to the shredder,
it's astronomical.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.677
Well, I'll run the serial
numbers-- maybe they'll pop.

04:11.552 --> 04:12.920
(beeping)

04:12.953 --> 04:14.888
What was that?

04:14.922 --> 04:16.624
It must be a marked bill.

04:16.657 --> 04:18.326
Serial number's on the hot list.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.634
Hey, that's D.B. Cooper money.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.502
Seriously?

04:30.438 --> 04:31.405
Who's D.B. Cooper?

04:31.439 --> 04:33.507
You know the lifespan
of a $20 bill, but not

04:33.541 --> 04:36.544
the most famous unsolved
crime in American history?

04:36.577 --> 04:38.779
He hijacked a plane back in...
what was it, the '60s?

04:38.812 --> 04:39.813
DAVID:
1971.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.482
Got 200 grand from the airline,

04:41.515 --> 04:44.352
jumped out the plane
and just disappeared.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.653
So, how does the ransom turn up

04:45.686 --> 04:47.521
in the Federal Reserve
38 years later?

04:59.900 --> 05:01.001
Day before Thanksgiving,

05:01.034 --> 05:03.003
a passenger
calling himself Dan Cooper

05:03.036 --> 05:04.705
showed a flight attendant
a bomb.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.474
He made that flight land
in Seattle

05:06.507 --> 05:08.942
where the airline gave him
200 grand

05:08.976 --> 05:10.878
and two sets of parachutes.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.346
He let all the passengers go,

05:12.380 --> 05:14.081
and then took off again
with the flight crew.

05:14.114 --> 05:16.850
Sometime in the next two hours,
he lowered the rear stairway

05:16.884 --> 05:20.020
of the plane, parachuted out
over the Oregon wilderness.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.455
That's one hell of a heist.

05:21.489 --> 05:22.756
Just the...
the skill set involved:

05:22.790 --> 05:24.658
bomb making, parachuting,
aviation.

05:24.692 --> 05:25.959
COLBY:
Just the insanity of it.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.728
You jump out of a plane

05:27.761 --> 05:31.131
at night in a rainstorm
over a forest of 100-foot trees.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.601
I mean, he could have saved time
just shooting himself.

05:33.634 --> 05:34.802
DAVID:
That's the consensus,

05:34.835 --> 05:36.970
but Cooper's body
was never found.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.840
The agents investigating figured
that he died in the jump.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.475
CHARLIE: Boy, I hope
that wasn't based

05:41.509 --> 05:43.411
on these projections
of the potential landing zone.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.746
What, you see a problem?

05:45.779 --> 05:47.080
The formula they used.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.717
Uh, it's kind of like
mathematical fondue.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.485
Maybe it was current
in the 1970s,

05:51.519 --> 05:54.455
but, I don't know, there have
been some exciting breakthroughs

05:54.488 --> 05:55.956
in modeling weather front
formation.

05:55.989 --> 05:59.026
You know, if I cull enough data

05:59.059 --> 06:02.029
on, uh, military and civilian
drop statistics,

06:02.062 --> 06:04.732
I could recalculate D.B.
Cooper's chances of survival.

06:04.765 --> 06:07.768
DAVID: Be amazing to crack
this thing after 40 years.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.670
Hey, you think
the, uh, armored car robbers

06:09.703 --> 06:10.604
knew what they were stealing?

06:10.638 --> 06:12.973
220 bucks in marked bills--
I doubt it.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.042
Besides, when I mentioned
D.B. Cooper, they were shocked.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.645
But they did think
it was pretty cool.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.780
NIKKI: Got a report back
from the crime lab.

06:19.813 --> 06:22.550
Cooper bills showed signs
of prolonged exposure

06:22.583 --> 06:24.652
to unusually hot, dry air.

06:24.685 --> 06:27.054
Also traces of gypsum dust.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.989
That's drywall, right?
COLBY: Guys...

06:29.022 --> 06:31.792
guess who worked
this case back in the '70s.

06:33.561 --> 06:35.529
Roger Bloom?
He's been around that long?

06:35.563 --> 06:37.798
COLBY: Could be a big help.
Well, we would've never busted

06:37.831 --> 06:39.967
the copycat bank robbers
if it weren't for him.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.135
(phones ringing)
-He had a bit of a man crush

06:42.169 --> 06:43.103
on you, didn't he?
-Well, he hates Nikki.

06:43.136 --> 06:46.674
He doesn't hate me.
He just doesn't get me.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.809
You should probably knock
on his door in the morning.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.478
What's with the phones
around here?

06:50.511 --> 06:51.745
DAVID:
No, no comment.

06:51.779 --> 06:52.946
I said, "No comment."

06:52.980 --> 06:55.649
Someone leaked the D.B. Cooper
story to one of the blogs,

06:55.683 --> 06:57.050
so it's, uh... it's going crazy.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.719
Which means we have
about ten minutes

06:58.752 --> 07:01.054
before TV vans block
the parking garage exit.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.524
(laughing)

07:03.557 --> 07:05.459
(phones ringing)

07:09.029 --> 07:10.631
Man.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.466
(phones ringing)

07:15.503 --> 07:18.572
BLOOM: Why is it only G-men
ring the doorbell

07:18.606 --> 07:20.040
at 6:30 in the morning?

07:20.073 --> 07:21.208
It's not my fault

07:21.241 --> 07:24.812
you worked on every major
FBI case since Patty Hearst.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.880
D.B. Cooper-- as soon
as I heard the news,

07:26.914 --> 07:28.816
I knew you guys
were going to find my number.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.150
Sunny-side up good?
-Yeah, it's fine.

07:30.183 --> 07:31.852
So, what do you say?

07:31.885 --> 07:34.121
You want to take another run
at the one that got away?

07:34.154 --> 07:35.623
This is not a good time.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.124
I just started a security
consulting firm

07:37.157 --> 07:39.126
to make ends meet.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.761
Make yourself useful, will you?

07:40.794 --> 07:42.229
Get a plate
and put on some toast.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.164
COLBY:
You know,

07:44.197 --> 07:47.067
there's still a $50,000 reward
out there.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.969
Not to mention the, uh,

07:49.002 --> 07:51.071
publicity for your new business.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.673
All right, here's a tip.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.908
It wasn't $200,000.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.644
He got away with closer
to a million.

07:56.677 --> 07:59.079
The Bureau and the airline
downplayed the take

07:59.112 --> 08:00.648
to weed out false confessions.

08:02.182 --> 08:05.185
Something else
that's buried in your boxes:

08:05.218 --> 08:07.588
Three weeks after the hijacking,

08:07.621 --> 08:10.023
a search team finds
a corpse in a tree

08:10.057 --> 08:12.192
in the landing zone--
Eddie Sawyer.

08:12.225 --> 08:15.596
Professional thief,
paratrooper from Vietnam.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.865
So, Sawyer was Cooper?

08:17.898 --> 08:19.767
Yeah, we thought so, too.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.670
But none of the witnesses on the
plane could I.D. his photograph.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.304
And later on,
the autopsy told us

08:24.337 --> 08:26.607
that he was stabbed to death
before he ever hit the tree.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.676
Now, Cooper did order
two sets of chutes.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.211
Okay, so Cooper was working
with another guy.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.213
He knifed him
and threw him out of the plane.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.949
That's the theory.
(timer dings)

08:38.886 --> 08:40.888
AMITA: David?
DAVID: Hey.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.055
Hi.
How you doing?

08:42.089 --> 08:43.791
Uh, Charlie's working
from home today.

08:43.824 --> 08:45.258
Um, well, actually,
I was looking for you.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.027
Okay, here it is.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.863
I have a date for,
uh, Saturday night.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.264
It's, uh... it's the symphony.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.266
I need some help buying a suit.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.268
Don't you have a lot of suits?

08:55.302 --> 08:57.771
They all make me
look like, uh...

08:57.805 --> 08:59.740
An FBI agent?

08:59.773 --> 09:01.642
Yeah. You know, I mean,

09:01.675 --> 09:03.711
Don and I, we...
we don't have the same taste.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.813
And Colby's idea of dressing up
is a string tie.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.615
Liz is out of town.

09:07.648 --> 09:10.618
If I even tell Nikki
that I have a date...

09:10.651 --> 09:13.053
You always look good.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.723
Your clothes are great, so...
-I would be happy to help you.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.291
And not tell Nikki.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.893
Appreciate it. Thank you.
-Sure.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.328
We scan the serial number
of every bill

09:21.361 --> 09:22.830
that's sent for shredding.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.364
If those notes had passed
through our system,

09:24.397 --> 09:25.833
my people would
have flagged them.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.835
Not if someone
didn't want them flagged.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.136
From the moment you drive in,

09:29.169 --> 09:32.139
every move you make
is observed and recorded.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.707
And the guards work in teams.

09:33.741 --> 09:36.176
Only person
who's left alone with the cash

09:36.209 --> 09:38.245
for even a second
is the armored car driver.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.847
That's Wesley Till?

09:39.880 --> 09:42.315
And he's thoroughly searched,
and his personal cash

09:42.349 --> 09:44.184
is counted before
and after every shift.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.285
What time does he get in?

09:45.318 --> 09:47.688
Well, he doesn't.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.156
If your guys got teargassed,

09:49.189 --> 09:50.891
wouldn't you give them
a week off?

09:50.924 --> 09:52.192
No. Actually, in my case,

09:52.225 --> 09:54.027
I'm going to go make them
bang on his door.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.263
BLOOM: Altitude-- 9,800
to 10,000 feet.

09:56.296 --> 09:56.997
CHARLIE:
Okay.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.199
(typing)
Velocity-- 170 knots.

09:59.232 --> 10:03.003
Winds-- outside, west, 15 knots.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.938
(trilling)

10:04.972 --> 10:07.240
Okay. That brings us
to a landing

10:07.274 --> 10:09.910
right around... here.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.979
"Hey, look at me.
I'm hanging in a tree, dead."

10:12.012 --> 10:14.047
Strange enough to watch you
revert to childhood,

10:14.081 --> 10:15.248
but it wasn't even your own.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.117
Those were your brother's toys.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.352
This is a detailed map
of the terrain of D.B. Cooper's

10:19.386 --> 10:22.355
landing zone, constructed
in order to calculate

10:22.389 --> 10:24.057
his odds of survival.

10:24.091 --> 10:26.393
Which, by the way, defies sense.

10:26.426 --> 10:29.062
Why jump here,
when the terrain clears out

10:29.096 --> 10:30.764
only 70 miles later?
-Well, the time was calculated

10:30.798 --> 10:32.833
by a dip in the nose
of the plane.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.234
No one actually saw him jump.

10:34.267 --> 10:35.869
So we shift the jump time.

10:35.903 --> 10:36.804
BLOOM:
Mm-hmm.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.005
You know,
back when that was happening,

10:38.038 --> 10:40.140
it seemed like someone hijacked
a plane every other week.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.742
And the only name
we ever remember

10:41.775 --> 10:43.110
is D.B. Cooper.
(chuckles)

10:43.143 --> 10:44.211
Probably because
you never found him.

10:44.244 --> 10:47.447
No, it was probably because
of the times, you know?

10:47.480 --> 10:50.217
All that anti-establishment
stuff going on.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.319
I wasn't anti the country.
I was bleeding for it.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.453
Some of us felt

10:53.486 --> 10:56.223
that the country and the
establishment weren't the same.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.291
Yeah, and some of us
were shipped home in cargo.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.694
You know who my hero was?

11:00.728 --> 11:02.062
Freddy O'Casio.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.832
He saved my unit
from a six-hour firefight.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.700
Not some lowlife who jeopardized

11:06.734 --> 11:08.435
40 innocent people
for a quick payoff.

11:08.468 --> 11:12.039
Six minutes. If-If Cooper had
jumped only six minutes later,

11:12.072 --> 11:14.007
uh, the terrain would
have cleared out somewhat,

11:14.041 --> 11:16.977
and, uh, that would have
increased his chances of

11:17.010 --> 11:19.012
survival considerably.
-Congratulations.

11:19.046 --> 11:22.315
Your hero might have
survived, after all.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.316
(snorts)
-Doesn't make sense.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.284
Yeah, tell me about it.

11:24.317 --> 11:26.219
I came in here looking
for a watering can,

11:26.253 --> 11:28.355
and I found my past
under attack.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.323
Cooper had to assume
those bills were marked.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.326
Boy, 50% is a high risk of death
for a payoff he couldn't use.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.462
Well, next time,
I'll use a hose.

11:37.497 --> 11:38.999
DAVID:
Armored car driver maybe,

11:39.032 --> 11:41.301
but if Wesley Till
has D.B. Cooper's money,

11:41.334 --> 11:43.403
he isn't spending it on rent.

11:43.436 --> 11:44.838
Hey, explain something to me.

11:44.872 --> 11:48.441
If the hijacker
called himself Dan Cooper,

11:48.475 --> 11:49.442
where'd "D.B." come from?

11:49.476 --> 11:52.145
Press. One article
called him "D.B. Cooper,"

11:52.179 --> 11:53.480
every other reporter
repeated the mistake.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.783
Now, the Bureau ran the name
Dan Cooper.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.384
Turns out he was the hero

11:57.417 --> 11:59.486
of a French comic book
in the '60s.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.009
Cold.

12:22.042 --> 12:22.943
No reception.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.812
I'm going to step out
and get some bars.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.016
Phew.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.483
(rhythmic thumping)

12:37.891 --> 12:38.859
(thumping ceases)

12:38.892 --> 12:40.527
(steady buzzing)

12:52.840 --> 12:54.174
(buzzing ceases)

12:58.879 --> 13:03.383
"Prolonged exposure
to hot, dry air."

13:03.416 --> 13:06.053
(knocking)

13:06.086 --> 13:07.821
(chuckles softly)

13:10.257 --> 13:12.960
(grunting)

13:23.336 --> 13:25.238
Oh... oh, man.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.341
(whispers):
Oh, man.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.979
1969.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.280
(gun cocks)

13:33.313 --> 13:35.448
MAN:
Hands in the air.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.554
Friend, you walked
into the wrong house.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.233
On your knees.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.602
Now.

13:55.635 --> 13:57.304
(gun cocks)
-NIKKI: FBI.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.039
Drop it, Pops.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.074
You're agents?

14:03.176 --> 14:04.912
Then you can show me a badge.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.984
My apologies.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.053
I thought you were a burglar.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.022
Yeah?

14:15.055 --> 14:16.456
Who are you?
-Ray Till.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.525
Wesley's uncle.

14:18.558 --> 14:21.494
We're spending the holidays
camping in the Sierras.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.296
Call Wesley at work.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.165
He'll clear it up.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.668
Mr. Till,

14:28.701 --> 14:31.371
there's something
we need you to see.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.446
Is this your nephew?

14:54.327 --> 14:56.663
RAY:
He was the finest man I know.

14:58.265 --> 15:01.534
Kind of man I wish
I could've been.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.470
The money in the wall,

15:03.503 --> 15:05.038
any idea where it came from?

15:05.072 --> 15:07.107
Wesley didn't care about money.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.675
Didn't even own a TV.

15:08.708 --> 15:11.011
(pills rattle)

15:13.146 --> 15:15.715
Multiple myeloma.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.952
Doctors give me
about four months.

15:18.986 --> 15:21.254
I'm sorry.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.257
Eh, you don't need to be.

15:24.291 --> 15:27.394
Since I found out,
I've been using my time better,

15:27.427 --> 15:28.628
doing things that matter.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.199
That's nice ink.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.735
My whole unit got it

15:35.768 --> 15:38.405
one drunken weekend in Da Nang.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.673
We were part of the biggest

15:40.707 --> 15:43.276
combat jump of the whole war.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.249
DAVID:
Wesley Till gets a job

15:49.282 --> 15:50.617
transporting money
to be shredded.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.520
So he shows up to work
with marked D.B. Cooper bills

15:53.553 --> 15:56.356
and he goes home
with unmarked cash.

15:56.389 --> 15:59.259
The Fed records how much
personal cash the drivers get

15:59.292 --> 16:00.227
onto the trucks with.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.329
Till was showing up
with anywhere between

16:02.362 --> 16:04.464
160 and 240 bucks.

16:04.497 --> 16:05.665
So, over 11 months,

16:05.698 --> 16:07.434
I mean, he could have
swapped out $63,000.

16:07.467 --> 16:11.271
Okay, so you add in the
160 grand we found in his wall,

16:11.304 --> 16:15.375
and... so where is
the other $777,000?

16:15.408 --> 16:18.611
No, slight correction: $771,000.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.747
$5,880 washed up

16:20.780 --> 16:22.749
in the Columbia River in 1980.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.717
Okay, so this bill swapping,

16:24.751 --> 16:26.553
it's not like holding up
a drugstore, right?

16:26.586 --> 16:27.720
It takes planning,

16:27.754 --> 16:30.190
uh, it takes, uh, patience,
a lot like the hijacking.

16:30.223 --> 16:33.226
All right, that's a
compelling argument, if Till

16:33.260 --> 16:34.627
was alive in 1971.

16:34.661 --> 16:35.795
His uncle was.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.630
And he's an ex-paratrooper.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.766
COLBY: Wait a minute.
That's what you're going with--

16:39.799 --> 16:42.102
that Uncle Ray is D.B. Cooper?

16:42.135 --> 16:44.604
They never found a body
or a parachute.

16:44.637 --> 16:47.540
That cash in the wall
had to come from somewhere.

16:47.574 --> 16:48.775
Come on.
I can't be the only one

16:48.808 --> 16:50.577
thinking that it's
at least possible.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.712
You want to put a lunch on it?

16:52.745 --> 16:53.746
Make it two lunches.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.782
I just... I hate eating alone.

16:55.815 --> 16:58.718
Two burritos
from the vending machine.

16:58.751 --> 16:59.752
Burritos?

16:59.786 --> 17:02.122
Hey, I'm hedging, all right?

17:02.155 --> 17:05.358
But that's a lot
of coincidence.

17:05.392 --> 17:08.295
You know, it might be worth it
to see what Uncle Ray does next.

17:08.328 --> 17:09.729
Let me know what else
you find out.

17:09.762 --> 17:10.797
NIKKI:
Okay.

17:10.830 --> 17:13.066
Back to the boxes.

17:13.100 --> 17:14.634
Roger, you want
to help me out?

17:14.667 --> 17:16.369
Oh, that's what I came for.

17:16.403 --> 17:17.837
She'll grow on you.
-Yeah.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.739
Yeah, maybe.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.144
David, hey. So, I pulled

17:24.177 --> 17:25.812
some pictures from magazines
just to get a sense

17:25.845 --> 17:27.714
of what you're thinking.
-Well, um,

17:27.747 --> 17:29.482
I was thinking
something more simple,

17:29.516 --> 17:31.751
but not too loud,
but, um...

17:31.784 --> 17:34.787
that would st-still
make a good statement.

17:34.821 --> 17:37.457
Well, do-do you like
a particular color?

17:37.490 --> 17:40.093
I think it's... it's really
all about the fabric.

17:40.127 --> 17:42.829
Yeah, well, that's...
that's important, too.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.664
Well, maybe you could just
pick up a couple

17:44.697 --> 17:45.865
of the ones that you like.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.434
I could pick out one, and...

17:47.467 --> 17:49.236
I could just return
the rest. -Okay.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.671
-Thanks.
-Uh-huh. Bye.

17:53.773 --> 17:56.676
CHARLIE: Even accounting
for the safer drop zones,

17:56.709 --> 18:00.113
Cooper's risk/reward ratio
is, like, massively out of line.

18:00.147 --> 18:01.748
Maybe the guy wasn't good
at math.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.750
These are patterns that are
hardwired into the human brain.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.585
And not only humans;
the behavior of monkeys,

18:05.618 --> 18:07.120
and fish and the way

18:07.154 --> 18:08.821
that bees choose flowers.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.757
50 mice forage in a field.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.493
Well, if our mice are only
concerned with the reward,

18:13.526 --> 18:15.128
then their distribution
would correlate

18:15.162 --> 18:16.896
with the concentration of food.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.166
But barn owls hunt
much more effectively

18:19.199 --> 18:21.401
over open terrain
than in brush.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.736
How many mice will brave
the dangerous open terrain

18:23.770 --> 18:25.772
for a feast,
and how many will choose

18:25.805 --> 18:27.574
the less-rewarding brush?

18:27.607 --> 18:30.810
Each mouse weighs danger, food,
risk, reward.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.612
So, to make that jump with bills

18:32.645 --> 18:34.181
that he had
to assume were marked,

18:34.214 --> 18:35.815
Cooper was like a mouse that ran

18:35.848 --> 18:37.817
into the middle of a field
looking for food

18:37.850 --> 18:39.886
that he didn't even think
he was able to eat.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.354
Right. Maybe that's it.

18:41.388 --> 18:43.590
The ri is the reward.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.192
Like an adrenaline high.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.727
Speaking of adrenaline,
by the way, this morning,

18:47.760 --> 18:49.862
Dad made an offhanded comment

18:49.896 --> 18:51.931
about D.B. Cooper
being a folk hero.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.834
And it started this whole
argument about the '60s,

18:54.867 --> 18:57.504
and just the way
that Bloom reacted,

18:57.537 --> 19:01.541
honestly, I'm glad that he
doesn't carry a gun anymore.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.943
Actually, I think he does
carry a gun.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.912
He really went off on Dad.
-Well, the guy's a vet.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.347
I mean, he comes home and...

19:07.380 --> 19:08.781
and people are calling him
"baby killer."

19:08.815 --> 19:09.682
You don't think that Dad

19:09.716 --> 19:12.319
ever called anyone
a baby killer. -No,

19:12.352 --> 19:14.787
but sometimes,
I'm not sure he really gets

19:14.821 --> 19:16.556
what guys like Bloom
went through.

19:21.594 --> 19:24.231
Hey, check this out.
-Hmm?

19:24.264 --> 19:25.565
Every month, Wesley Till

19:25.598 --> 19:28.768
wired money to a flower store
in Westminster;

19:28.801 --> 19:31.504
total of $62,580.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.973
That's about what we think
he was swapping out of the Fed.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.309
Yeah, and Westminster
is Little Saigon.

19:36.343 --> 19:37.810
And Uncle Ray is a vet.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.980
Now, it's funny how this case
keeps circling back to Vietnam.

19:41.013 --> 19:41.914
Yeah, listen to this.

19:41.948 --> 19:44.717
Uncle Ray trained soldiers
in parachuting

19:44.751 --> 19:45.818
before being deployed.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.954
His unit was accused
of committing

19:47.987 --> 19:50.290
war crimes in a village
called Nu Bac.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.259
What kind of crimes?
-Doesn't say.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.629
Oh, hello.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.431
Look who else was in Nu Bac:

19:58.465 --> 20:00.867
Specialist Edward Sawyer.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.703
Oh, this is the guy they found
in the tree.

20:03.736 --> 20:04.937
See, I'm beginning to think

20:04.971 --> 20:06.806
that Colby and David
owe you a burrito;

20:06.839 --> 20:07.940
three kinds of cheese.

20:07.974 --> 20:10.277
I knew I should have held out
for that surf and turf.

20:14.481 --> 20:15.982
DAVID: In a room
with a dozen computers

20:16.015 --> 20:18.651
and free Wi-Fi,
he uses microfilm.

20:18.685 --> 20:19.919
COLBY:
According to his tax records,

20:19.952 --> 20:22.455
they say he's been living
on the Oregon side

20:22.489 --> 20:24.957
of the Klamath Mountains
for the last 25 years.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.493
Hey, they, uh... they have

20:26.526 --> 20:28.261
Internet service
in the mountains, right?

20:28.295 --> 20:32.399
I'm going to take you camping,
if only for entertainment value.

20:40.507 --> 20:42.342
I'll get the car.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.685
The guy who just left,
what was he looking at?

20:52.719 --> 20:54.487
Oh, Mr. Till isn't in trouble,
is he?

20:54.521 --> 20:56.055
You know him?
-Every few weeks,

20:56.088 --> 20:57.924
he shows up,
spends all day here reading.

20:57.957 --> 21:00.627
Sometimes a few days
in a row.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.362
Today was old newspapers;

21:02.395 --> 21:03.596
seven rolls.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.332
Okay, well, I'm going to need
all of them.

21:05.365 --> 21:07.767
Do you have a library card?

21:07.800 --> 21:09.436
Uh...

21:09.469 --> 21:12.339
I mean,
I've been meaning to get one.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.380
Remember,
in the Vietnamese culture,

21:20.413 --> 21:23.316
the more deferential you are
to the proprietor, the better.

21:23.350 --> 21:24.784
You get tough, you get nothing.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.486
I know how to talk
to people, Roger.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.888
Hello. Can I help you?

21:28.921 --> 21:29.889
NIKKI:
FBI.

21:29.922 --> 21:33.092
If you have a moment,
we'd like to talk to you

21:33.125 --> 21:34.961
about some money
that was wired to your store.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.896
The $63,000.

21:36.929 --> 21:38.598
You have some idea
where it's from?

21:38.631 --> 21:40.099
Actually,
we were going to ask you.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.669
When the money first appeared,
I told the bank

21:42.702 --> 21:44.804
it must be a mistake.
They said it wasn't.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.439
Wait a minute-- you get money

21:46.473 --> 21:48.708
every month, you have no idea
where it comes from,

21:48.741 --> 21:50.710
you just pocket it,
you don't ask any questions?

21:50.743 --> 21:52.845
No. I tried to return it,

21:52.879 --> 21:55.114
but the bank
couldn't trace the sender.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.450
I didn't want any trouble
from the IRS,

21:57.484 --> 22:01.020
so I had them write a letter
verifying my story.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.096
Thanks for the diplomacy lesson.

22:10.129 --> 22:10.963
Okay, all right.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.765
I know.

22:16.135 --> 22:18.505
You got to admire
a well-executed stonewalling.

22:18.538 --> 22:19.706
Letter and everything.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.744
Do you like Vietnamese food?

22:24.777 --> 22:27.780
There is a takeout place
about three blocks up that makes

22:27.814 --> 22:29.148
an unbelievable pho.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.518
Please tell me that's not
some breed of dog.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.119
No, that's some breed
of noodle soup.

22:33.152 --> 22:35.688
You have to broaden
your horizons, miss.

22:39.759 --> 22:42.161
COLBY: He's going
into Teddy Antell's place.

22:42.194 --> 22:45.097
DAVID: What is Till doing
with the biggest silver

22:45.131 --> 22:47.166
and jewelry thief
on the West Coast?

22:47.199 --> 22:48.401
Well, it's a social club.

22:48.435 --> 22:50.803
Maybe he wants to socialize.

22:52.171 --> 22:54.741
(three gunshots)

22:56.142 --> 22:58.578
(tires squealing)
-(siren wailing)

23:05.084 --> 23:05.918
FBI.

23:05.952 --> 23:09.956
* The thought of you
makes me stop *

23:11.057 --> 23:13.693
* Before I begin

23:15.161 --> 23:18.931
* 'Cause I've got you

23:20.767 --> 23:22.669
* Under my skin

23:26.138 --> 23:30.042
* 'Cause I've got you

23:30.076 --> 23:32.912
* Under my skin.

23:32.945 --> 23:34.413
(handcuffs clicking)

23:42.589 --> 23:44.757
NIKKI:
DOA is Guy Russo,

23:44.791 --> 23:46.626
Teddy Antell's right-hand man.

23:46.659 --> 23:48.194
We tossed Russo's car.

23:48.227 --> 23:49.796
Blood smears
turned up consistent

23:49.829 --> 23:52.965
with Wesley Till's type
and papers taken from his house.

23:52.999 --> 23:54.000
Well, do the DNA.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.868
I say we close the Wesley case.

23:55.902 --> 23:58.137
So, how did Uncle Ray
close it first?

24:00.206 --> 24:02.675
I was looking for a lady
I used to know.

24:02.709 --> 24:05.978
And you just happened to run
into your nephew's murderer,

24:06.012 --> 24:07.213
and you shot him.

24:07.246 --> 24:09.549
All I did was walk in a door.

24:09.582 --> 24:11.150
He drew and shot first.

24:11.183 --> 24:13.152
As I'm sure the bartender's
already told you.

24:13.185 --> 24:14.120
Yes, he did.

24:16.188 --> 24:18.257
I'm Roger Bloom.

24:18.290 --> 24:21.127
They asked me to look
at your service file.

24:21.160 --> 24:25.097
I was up in the
Central Highlands, near Laos.

24:25.131 --> 24:27.199
How was it over there?

24:27.233 --> 24:29.736
I saw what I saw.

24:29.769 --> 24:31.203
You saw more.

24:31.237 --> 24:33.740
You blew the whistle
on your own unit

24:33.773 --> 24:35.274
for a massacre at Nu Bac.

24:35.307 --> 24:38.578
All I did was not cover it up.

24:38.611 --> 24:40.279
David, he is being modest.

24:40.312 --> 24:43.550
In Nam, if you stuck
your neck out,

24:43.583 --> 24:46.285
if you spoke up, you knew
what was going to happen.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.587
They'd suppress
your commendations,

24:47.620 --> 24:50.222
they'd write you up
for dirty boots,

24:50.256 --> 24:52.992
a bullet hole in your helmet.

24:53.025 --> 24:55.728
And if you
were really stubborn,

24:55.762 --> 24:58.097
they sent you out on the wire,

24:58.130 --> 24:59.999
where the bullet
with your name could find you.

25:00.032 --> 25:01.033
Lucky it only had

25:01.067 --> 25:02.034
my first name.

25:02.068 --> 25:02.969
Yeah.

25:03.002 --> 25:05.304
You went home
with a medical discharge.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.305
Report's buried,

25:06.338 --> 25:07.674
end of career.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.842
And that's the way it was
over there.

25:09.876 --> 25:12.278
You always paid
for what you didn't do.

25:12.311 --> 25:14.547
I'm not much
for swapping war stories.

25:14.581 --> 25:15.882
DAVID: Well, here's
your service photo.

25:15.915 --> 25:18.851
Here's a composite sketch
of the suspect

25:18.885 --> 25:20.553
from a 1971 hijacking.

25:20.587 --> 25:21.688
The money we found

25:21.721 --> 25:24.991
in Wesley's wall
is from that hijacking.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.293
We knew that he was using
his job to launder it.

25:27.326 --> 25:29.061
BLOOM:
The Army screwed you.

25:29.095 --> 25:30.329
A million dollars,

25:30.362 --> 25:32.298
that's a lot of payback.

25:32.331 --> 25:36.636
Fellas, I promise
I am not D.B. Cooper

25:36.669 --> 25:40.573
or Jimmy Hoffa or Amelia Earhart

25:40.607 --> 25:42.308
or the Abominable Snowman.

25:42.341 --> 25:46.045
Am I being held?

25:50.249 --> 25:51.918
What do we do with this guy?

25:51.951 --> 25:54.220
We can hold him for Russo,
but it won't stick.

25:54.253 --> 25:56.288
It doesn't have to.
Teddy Antell will make sure

25:56.322 --> 25:57.624
Till doesn't last
a week in jail.

25:57.657 --> 25:58.557
Right. If we release him,

25:58.591 --> 25:59.992
then he disappears
back into the mountains.

26:00.026 --> 26:01.027
NIKKI:
And if he does?

26:01.060 --> 26:02.361
We closed Wesley Till's murder.

26:02.394 --> 26:03.996
You know, at the end of the day,

26:04.030 --> 26:05.765
how important
is a 40-year-old crime?

26:05.798 --> 26:07.867
You're seriously asking why
we're interested in solving

26:07.900 --> 26:09.969
the most famous hijacking
in history?

26:10.002 --> 26:11.704
Not when you put it like that.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.840
Do yourselves a favor--
just kick Till loose.

26:13.873 --> 26:15.808
There's a 50 grand reward
on the hook.

26:15.842 --> 26:17.276
It gives you guys time,

26:17.309 --> 26:20.379
and trust me, Uncle Ray
is not disappearing on me.

26:20.412 --> 26:23.950
Might be our least bad solution.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.655
Hey, so you got into it
with my dad, I heard.

26:28.688 --> 26:30.222
I follow the rules all the time.

26:30.256 --> 26:32.291
Everybody else is doing
whatever the hell they want.

26:32.324 --> 26:35.327
It might seem like, you know,
ancient history to some people;

26:35.361 --> 26:37.263
to me, yesterday.

26:39.331 --> 26:43.102
I was 15,
and we had this gardener

26:43.135 --> 26:44.336
who worked on the street.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.272
This, uh, Mexican guy--
he had a funky walk.

26:46.305 --> 26:47.907
And me, being the idiot
that I was,

26:47.940 --> 26:49.876
would-would do the walk
for everybody on the block.

26:49.909 --> 26:52.879
Well, my dad saw me one day,

26:52.912 --> 26:55.682
and I'm telling you,
he had me on my knees

26:55.715 --> 27:00.019
pulling weeds
for two weeks in August.

27:00.052 --> 27:02.655
So, you talk about rules...

27:02.689 --> 27:05.157
I learned all about the rules
from him.

27:10.062 --> 27:11.397
AMITA:
I have a favorite,

27:11.430 --> 27:13.365
but I'm not going
to tell you which.

27:13.399 --> 27:14.433
Okay.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.368
Yeah, the, uh... those are...

27:16.402 --> 27:17.369
those are good.

27:17.403 --> 27:18.337
They're good.

27:18.370 --> 27:20.439
I could get something else.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.208
What about, like-like,
tweed, you know?

27:22.241 --> 27:23.409
Tweed?

27:23.442 --> 27:27.279
You know, or-or pinstripe
is nice as well.

27:27.313 --> 27:29.949
Tweed or pinstripes.

27:29.982 --> 27:32.719
No, no...
-COLBY: You ready?

27:32.752 --> 27:34.220
Uh, I got to go.

27:34.253 --> 27:35.321
I-I'll call you, okay?

27:35.354 --> 27:36.422
Thank you.

27:38.257 --> 27:41.127
(jazz playing,
billiard balls clacking)

27:46.032 --> 27:47.366
Crime scene tape is down.

27:47.399 --> 27:49.135
This is a private club again.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.704
Well, we're here
for an intervention, Teddy.

27:51.738 --> 27:52.972
Look at you.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.874
Drinking alone, 11:00 a.m.

27:54.907 --> 27:57.844
I mean, how can you run a
criminal enterprise responsibly?

27:57.877 --> 27:59.478
Funny guy.

27:59.511 --> 28:00.412
I liked you Feds better

28:00.446 --> 28:02.715
back when you were
J. Edgar Hoover types.

28:02.749 --> 28:03.750
That'd be him.

28:03.783 --> 28:05.818
Totally humorless.

28:05.852 --> 28:07.186
Any idea why Guy Russo killed

28:07.219 --> 28:08.988
an armored car driver
named Wesley Till?

28:10.356 --> 28:12.024
TEDDY:
Typical G-man.

28:12.058 --> 28:13.860
Pin your crime on a dead man
before he's even

28:13.893 --> 28:15.394
in the ground.

28:15.427 --> 28:16.929
Here's a hint for you.

28:16.963 --> 28:19.198
160 grand in his wall,

28:19.231 --> 28:21.801
another 771 out there
up for grabs.

28:23.102 --> 28:25.404
You already have
all the answers.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.239
Why not talk to each other,

28:27.273 --> 28:28.908
leave me out of it?

28:28.941 --> 28:30.309
Because the guy
Russo underestimated

28:30.342 --> 28:32.178
just happens to be
Wesley Till's uncle.

28:33.279 --> 28:35.447
And we had to let him go.

28:35.481 --> 28:36.883
DAVID:
Now, I don't think Russo

28:36.916 --> 28:39.418
wiped his butt
without a phone call from you.

28:39.451 --> 28:41.888
So, second most important thing

28:41.921 --> 28:43.956
is Wesley's uncle
doesn't figure that out

28:43.990 --> 28:47.126
and come gunning for you.

28:47.159 --> 28:50.196
I'm supposed to ask what the
most important thing is, right?

28:50.229 --> 28:53.065
That nothing happens
to Wesley's uncle.

28:53.099 --> 28:58.104
Should a piano fall on his head,
worse things fall on yours.

29:01.874 --> 29:03.976
I mean, that was
a little bit funny, right?

29:07.914 --> 29:09.281
Bloom wouldn't even listen.

29:09.315 --> 29:11.050
Wouldn't even listen.
I mean, it was like...

29:11.083 --> 29:12.151
it was like being back
in the, uh...

29:12.184 --> 29:13.185
CHARLIE:
In the '60s

29:13.219 --> 29:15.121
all over again.
-Yeah, exactly.

29:15.154 --> 29:17.523
We'd marshal arguments, and
they'd impugn our patriotism.

29:17.556 --> 29:18.557
They hated us

29:18.590 --> 29:20.459
because we stood up
against the establishment.

29:20.492 --> 29:22.194
AMITA: Well, part of
marshaling an argument

29:22.228 --> 29:24.463
is making sure
your conclusions aren't skewed

29:24.496 --> 29:26.165
by preconceived notions?

29:26.198 --> 29:27.934
And your point?

29:30.002 --> 29:31.503
Bloom destroyed his career
trying to get justice

29:31.537 --> 29:32.872
for his sister.

29:32.905 --> 29:33.739
Then, he was nearly killed

29:33.772 --> 29:35.574
trying to clear his name
with the FBI.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.409
And?

29:37.443 --> 29:41.848
Um, maybe he's not
so much pro-establishment

29:41.881 --> 29:46.018
as he is
anti-airplane hijackers.

29:46.052 --> 29:47.854
Never mind.

29:49.421 --> 29:51.390
Well, I guess I just lost

29:51.423 --> 29:53.559
some daughter-in-law
points there.

29:53.592 --> 29:55.027
You notice how I
kept my mouth shut?

29:55.061 --> 29:56.562
Yeah, I did.
-Yeah.

29:56.595 --> 29:59.832
I already had one uncomfortable
moment with my brother.

29:59.866 --> 30:00.833
Thank you.

30:00.867 --> 30:01.934
I got it.

30:01.968 --> 30:04.036
I have no idea where that guy
came from, you know.

30:04.070 --> 30:06.572
It's like, there was
my mom, my dad, me,

30:06.605 --> 30:08.074
and then there was Don.

30:08.107 --> 30:10.509
Off playing
with G.I. Joes and guns.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.344
I thought you guys weren't
allowed to play with toy guns.

30:12.378 --> 30:14.446
We weren't. He...
he got his from this kid

30:14.480 --> 30:16.348
across the street--
uh, Kenny Caldwell.

30:16.382 --> 30:17.917
Why don't you just pay

30:17.950 --> 30:19.919
with your university I.D.?

30:19.952 --> 30:21.587
It only works on campus.

30:21.620 --> 30:25.491
Most restaurants near campus
accept I.D. payments.

30:27.593 --> 30:31.230
Alternative currency.

30:31.263 --> 30:35.134
Well, it actually only works
when you give them the I.D.

30:39.238 --> 30:42.441
Are you still at it?

30:42.474 --> 30:43.475
(sighs)

30:43.509 --> 30:45.111
Yeah, we got seven rolls,

30:45.144 --> 30:47.279
each spanning months,
dates all over the map.

30:47.313 --> 30:48.915
You know,
it took me half a day

30:48.948 --> 30:50.249
just to find
a microfilm machine.

30:50.282 --> 30:51.918
Look, just keep it simple, Matt.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.585
I mean, there's something
in these back issues that led

30:53.619 --> 30:55.187
Ray Till to Teddy's club.

30:55.221 --> 30:56.622
We just need to figure out what.

30:56.655 --> 30:57.957
Well, that's easy to say,

30:57.990 --> 30:59.291
but I've been here all night.

30:59.325 --> 31:00.659
Isn't this where Charlie
comes up

31:00.692 --> 31:02.261
with an algorithm or something?
Just... crr...

31:03.362 --> 31:04.897
You know what?

31:04.931 --> 31:06.999
When I was, uh, stationed
in Tel Aviv,

31:07.033 --> 31:09.268
this guy, he had stashed
a brick of plastique explosives,

31:09.301 --> 31:10.970
and we just couldn't
figure out where.

31:11.003 --> 31:12.939
And I realized that there was

31:12.972 --> 31:15.241
a sewer line
near where he worked.

31:15.274 --> 31:18.410
My boss made me and three other
agents wade through raw sewage

31:18.444 --> 31:21.413
for nine hours
while he went to the beach.

31:21.447 --> 31:25.151
After we found it, this guy,
he didn't even say "Thank you."

31:26.252 --> 31:27.920
So, thank you.

31:27.954 --> 31:29.221
Now, pick up the pace.

31:36.028 --> 31:38.564
I asked if anyone
at the bank found it suspicious

31:38.597 --> 31:42.068
that the source of Tina Tran's
money transfers were concealed.

31:42.101 --> 31:43.302
Nobody could answer.

31:43.335 --> 31:44.603
The risk-reward analysis.

31:44.636 --> 31:46.939
So, they didn't follow up,
they just sent a letter?

31:46.973 --> 31:48.040
NIKKI:
Apparently.

31:48.074 --> 31:49.408
I don't think
they're hiding anything.

31:49.441 --> 31:51.277
They're just plain incompetent.
-Well...

31:51.310 --> 31:53.012
All right, great.
So, what do we do now?

31:53.045 --> 31:54.246
It's not worthless!

31:54.280 --> 31:55.547
What?
-We've been assuming

31:55.581 --> 31:57.683
that Cooper's ransom
was worthless,

31:57.716 --> 31:59.151
because every bank in America

31:59.185 --> 32:00.686
was looking
for the serial numbers.

32:00.719 --> 32:03.189
But what about overseas?

32:03.222 --> 32:05.357
You see, the money's value
in the equation increases hugely

32:05.391 --> 32:07.626
in a foreign country
where the dollar is accepted

32:07.659 --> 32:09.228
alongside the local currency.

32:09.261 --> 32:10.262
And in 1971...

32:10.296 --> 32:11.630
Vietnam.

32:11.663 --> 32:13.265
Right? The risk-reward.

32:13.299 --> 32:14.967
No. No.

32:15.001 --> 32:16.335
Till was a paratrooper.

32:16.368 --> 32:18.337
He was even more aware
of the risk.

32:18.370 --> 32:19.205
The algorithm points

32:19.238 --> 32:22.474
to desperation,
the kind of desperation

32:22.508 --> 32:24.110
that would compel one to,
I don't know,

32:24.143 --> 32:25.978
pull a loved one
out of a burning building.

32:26.012 --> 32:27.613
Like a daughter?

32:27.646 --> 32:29.948
All right.

32:59.345 --> 33:01.547
*

33:33.212 --> 33:35.247
(sighs)

33:35.281 --> 33:38.150
Would it make you feel better if
I donated the money to the FBI?

33:38.184 --> 33:39.651
You were born in Vietnam, right?

33:39.685 --> 33:41.653
Yeah.
-And did it happen

33:41.687 --> 33:43.322
to be in a village
called Nu Bac?

33:43.355 --> 33:44.823
How did you know?

33:44.856 --> 33:47.326
Your father,
was he an American soldier?

33:47.359 --> 33:49.795
My mother never discussed
my father.

33:51.463 --> 33:54.500
Believe me, I-I asked.

33:54.533 --> 33:57.536
She died a few years
after we came here.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.774
I thought about looking...

34:02.808 --> 34:05.077
more than once.

34:05.111 --> 34:08.814
I don't mean to open wounds.

34:08.847 --> 34:11.750
Anything you can tell me...

34:15.421 --> 34:17.656
All right. First roll.
December, 1971.

34:17.689 --> 34:19.625
There's an article
on Edward Sawyer's death.

34:19.658 --> 34:21.260
Uh, the dead guy found
in the tree

34:21.293 --> 34:22.861
in the D.B. Cooper
landing zone.

34:22.894 --> 34:24.796
There's no mention of that,
but it does say

34:24.830 --> 34:26.398
he's survived
by his wife, Pauline,

34:26.432 --> 34:30.136
and their four-year-old son,
Edward Sawyer, Jr. Okay?

34:30.169 --> 34:31.770
All right. Fifth roll.

34:31.803 --> 34:36.375
1997. Death notice
for Pauline Sawyer Antell.

34:36.408 --> 34:39.545
Survivors include her son,
Edward Antell.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.147
Teddy Antell is Sawyer's kid.

34:41.180 --> 34:43.349
The son of D.B. Cooper's
partner.

34:43.382 --> 34:46.518
D.B. Cooper stabbed
Teddy Antell's dad,

34:46.552 --> 34:48.120
then threw him out
of an airplane.

34:48.154 --> 34:50.456
Antell saw Wesley on TV.
-Must have connected the name

34:50.489 --> 34:52.824
with all the news reports
about the D.B. Cooper money.

34:52.858 --> 34:55.327
He sent Russo to kill Wesley
to flush out Uncle Ray.

34:55.361 --> 34:56.895
This is about revenge.

34:56.928 --> 34:59.798
He wants the man
that killed his father.

34:59.831 --> 35:01.099
Great work.

35:05.871 --> 35:07.673
A few years
after Tina was born,

35:07.706 --> 35:09.508
an American soldier
came to their village

35:09.541 --> 35:11.210
and gave her mother money--
a lot.

35:11.243 --> 35:13.345
He paid for their way here,
then disappeared.

35:13.379 --> 35:15.314
I mean, she's Till's daughter.
She's got to be.

35:15.347 --> 35:17.483
There's your burning building.
Vietnam in 1971.

35:17.516 --> 35:18.817
Call Charlie.

35:18.850 --> 35:21.487
It'll balance his equation
and brighten his day.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.789
(Tina screaming)

35:25.757 --> 35:28.494
(screaming continues)

35:33.599 --> 35:34.833
(gunshots)
(tires squealing)

35:39.438 --> 35:41.207
(gunshots)
(tires squealing)

35:47.479 --> 35:49.448
DON:
I always think of this one case.

35:49.481 --> 35:51.950
This little girl was kidnapped,

35:51.983 --> 35:55.421
and the cops are pretty sure
it's a family friend,

35:55.454 --> 35:58.790
and so they search his place
and...

35:58.824 --> 36:00.426
they find nothing.

36:00.459 --> 36:02.694
So, they go back again.

36:02.728 --> 36:05.597
They get all the big boys,
the senior detectives,

36:05.631 --> 36:07.499
and...

36:07.533 --> 36:09.501
they didn't find anything,
either.

36:09.535 --> 36:12.471
Well, the guy confesses.

36:12.504 --> 36:13.605
He says he's got her

36:13.639 --> 36:16.542
in a room he built
underneath his garage.

36:16.575 --> 36:18.510
And they all go back again,

36:18.544 --> 36:20.912
and they still can't find it.

36:20.946 --> 36:22.814
I mean, it's that well-hidden.

36:24.750 --> 36:26.818
That was one house.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.687
BLOOM:
Why kidnap Tina Tran?

36:28.720 --> 36:29.888
If Antell's looking

36:29.921 --> 36:31.423
for payback for his father,

36:31.457 --> 36:32.724
why not just kill his daughter?

36:32.758 --> 36:35.394
Flush Till out?

36:35.427 --> 36:37.363
No. Guy with no phone,
no address?

36:37.396 --> 36:39.631
If Teddy knew how to get
to Till in the first place,

36:39.665 --> 36:41.300
he wouldn't have
had to kill Wesley.

36:42.868 --> 36:44.636
Till called him out.

36:45.937 --> 36:47.739
Tina Tran is Antell's leverage.

36:47.773 --> 36:49.408
All right. So, then, where?

36:49.441 --> 36:51.243
You know, I think
I can pin down the location

36:51.277 --> 36:54.613
by plotting Till's known
locations along with Antell's.

36:54.646 --> 36:56.715
DON: He isn't local, so he's
going to have to find a place

36:56.748 --> 36:58.884
he knows better than Antell,
who-who's from here.

36:58.917 --> 37:00.586
Critical data points.
Clear board.

37:00.619 --> 37:02.488
BLOOM: The library--
Till knows the library

37:02.521 --> 37:03.955
like the back of his hand.

37:03.989 --> 37:05.757
Or it's the library.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.862
All right, Till!

37:10.896 --> 37:13.699
We're doing this now!

37:13.732 --> 37:16.535
RAY: It was your father's
idea, the hijacking.

37:18.036 --> 37:20.005
I went along with it because...

37:20.038 --> 37:21.473
because I thought

37:21.507 --> 37:23.008
he was man enough
to pay his debts.

37:23.041 --> 37:24.576
TEDDY:
Careful, old man.

37:24.610 --> 37:27.913
I got your daughter here.

37:27.946 --> 37:30.316
RAY:
He needed me to pull it off.

37:30.349 --> 37:31.917
My intel background.

37:31.950 --> 37:33.685
Jumping skills.

37:33.719 --> 37:35.821
TEDDY: So, you used him,
then shivved him

37:35.854 --> 37:38.324
and threw him out of a plane.

37:38.357 --> 37:39.758
RAY:
The shiv was his.

37:39.791 --> 37:43.662
He was waiting for me to get
him safely on the ground.

37:43.695 --> 37:46.865
I got him before
he could get me.

37:46.898 --> 37:49.801
TEDDY: You're not talking
your way out of this, Till.

37:49.835 --> 37:53.339
My father gets justice tonight!

37:53.372 --> 37:56.675
Justice? For Eddie?

37:57.976 --> 38:01.380
In Nam, he was known
for two things:

38:01.413 --> 38:04.416
selling Army goods
on the black market

38:04.450 --> 38:06.518
and raping village girls.

38:06.552 --> 38:07.786
(Tina gasping)

38:07.819 --> 38:10.922
Say that again. Say it again!

38:10.956 --> 38:12.524
What, I stutter the first time?

38:12.558 --> 38:15.594
Take a damn DNA test, Teddy.

38:16.795 --> 38:19.064
She's not my daughter.

38:19.097 --> 38:22.000
She's your sister!

38:23.969 --> 38:29.375
I've been cleaning up
after your father for 38 years.

38:29.408 --> 38:32.378
Since the day I didn't stop him
in Nu Bac.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.719
I would have raised you
as my own.

38:42.554 --> 38:44.490
But your mother...

38:45.824 --> 38:49.094
If any man ever called out

38:49.127 --> 38:51.897
for a killing,
it was Eddie Sawyer.

38:53.131 --> 38:54.400
But Wesley?

38:56.435 --> 38:59.505
My nephew never hurt a soul.

39:03.008 --> 39:04.376
And for what?

39:04.410 --> 39:06.912
An old, dying man?

39:08.046 --> 39:09.581
FBI!

39:18.424 --> 39:21.527
(grunting)

39:21.560 --> 39:22.761
COLBY:
Your gun, please.

39:30.001 --> 39:33.071
I had it handled, but thank you.

39:53.224 --> 39:56.161
(indistinct radio transmissions)

40:01.933 --> 40:04.570
*

40:04.603 --> 40:06.104
BLOOM:
Why?

40:06.137 --> 40:07.539
She's not even your daughter.

40:07.573 --> 40:08.774
The usual.

40:08.807 --> 40:10.041
Love, I guess.

40:11.543 --> 40:14.112
Someone had to take
responsibility.

40:14.145 --> 40:16.582
* So I drove into the woods

40:16.615 --> 40:18.517
* And wandered aimlessly

40:18.550 --> 40:21.587
50 grand, credit
for closing D.B. Cooper.

40:21.620 --> 40:22.821
You'll be buying dinner
next time,

40:22.854 --> 40:24.856
and I don't mean burritos.

40:24.890 --> 40:30.061
* It turned out to be
the howling of a dog *

40:30.095 --> 40:32.564
* Or a wolf, to be exact

40:32.598 --> 40:35.467
All right. Just between us,

40:35.501 --> 40:37.235
what did you do
with the rest of the money?

40:37.268 --> 40:39.505
Nu Bac.

40:39.538 --> 40:42.073
Fixed a lot of things
over the years.

40:42.107 --> 40:43.241
* For my flesh
had to turned to fur *

40:43.274 --> 40:46.645
* Yeah, and my thoughts,
they surely were turned... *

40:46.678 --> 40:49.648
You know, that van
is just filled with gear.

40:49.681 --> 40:51.517
There's not a lot
of room in there.

40:53.018 --> 40:54.019
You'd show up tomorrow

40:54.052 --> 40:55.721
and give these guys
a statement, wouldn't you?

40:57.055 --> 40:59.991
* You can wear your fur

41:00.025 --> 41:02.260
* Like a river on fire

41:02.293 --> 41:04.830
* But you better be sure...

41:04.863 --> 41:06.498
I hope you don't
change your mind,

41:06.532 --> 41:08.166
'cause when he turns
that corner, he is gone.

41:08.199 --> 41:10.502
We'll never see him again.
-David...

41:10.536 --> 41:13.204
D.B. Cooper could never
have survived that jump.

41:14.840 --> 41:18.109
* On the day that I
turned 23... *

41:18.143 --> 41:20.512
ALAN: Now, what do you think
I can get

41:20.546 --> 41:21.547
for this?

41:21.580 --> 41:22.614
While any estimate
of the supply

41:22.648 --> 41:25.851
of broken plastic assault rifle
squirt guns must--

41:25.884 --> 41:28.654
absent extensive market
research-- remain speculative,

41:28.687 --> 41:30.656
the demand can be assessed
as zero.

41:30.689 --> 41:32.691
Well, why don't we just leave it
at Kenny Caldwell's doorstep?

41:32.724 --> 41:33.825
AMITA:
What about this?

41:33.859 --> 41:36.662
CHARLIE: Oh, hey, that can't be
sold. Can't sell that.

41:36.695 --> 41:38.664
That's my rock tumbler.
I used that to make

41:38.697 --> 41:40.532
all your Father's Day gifts.
-How could I forget?

41:40.566 --> 41:43.168
Huh? The watch band,
the cuff links...

41:43.201 --> 41:44.703
You wore them every day.

41:44.736 --> 41:45.737
Father's love.

41:45.771 --> 41:46.905
Oh, no, no.
-(Charlie laughs)

41:46.938 --> 41:49.074
Oh, that's, um, the '70s.

41:49.107 --> 41:50.609
Oh, I know.

41:50.642 --> 41:53.845
And Charlie
will give you $20 for this.

41:53.879 --> 41:55.714
I will?
-ALAN: I'll take five.

41:55.747 --> 41:57.583
I know the perfect person
for this suit.

41:57.616 --> 41:59.551
Hello.
-Hey. Sorry.

41:59.585 --> 42:01.019
Hey, guys. Uh...
-ALAN: Hey.

42:06.692 --> 42:08.694
Hey, what are you doing
with this?

42:08.727 --> 42:09.795
I was making room for Amita.

42:09.828 --> 42:12.297
I totally used to rule
the neighborhood

42:12.330 --> 42:14.132
with this puppy.

42:14.165 --> 42:15.701
Yeah. You ruled
the neighborhood? -I did.

42:15.734 --> 42:17.569
DON: What are you talking about?
Roger, you should see

42:17.603 --> 42:19.204
the range on this. Seriously,
I used to just have them

42:19.237 --> 42:21.272
all on the block, just like...
(imitates gunfire)

42:23.642 --> 42:25.276
Let's set up
a historic reenactment.

42:25.310 --> 42:26.778
Vets versus hippies.

42:26.812 --> 42:28.580
Me and Dad
versus the two of you.

42:28.614 --> 42:29.781
DON:
Total blowout.

42:29.815 --> 42:32.117
Come on. We'll kill them.
-You can set up a field of fire.

42:32.150 --> 42:33.852
That does not qualify you
as a vet.

42:33.885 --> 42:36.121
'Cause it's... it's more

42:36.154 --> 42:38.123
of a state of mind, right, Alan?

42:38.156 --> 42:40.025
That's right. That's right.
-Mm-hmm.

42:40.058 --> 42:41.693
Uh, the same way scraggly hair

42:41.727 --> 42:43.695
and a four-day growth of beard
doesn't make you a rebel.

42:43.729 --> 42:46.164
You know, one time,
on one of those Freedom Rides,

42:46.197 --> 42:48.299
this, uh, Alabama state trooper
hit me

42:48.333 --> 42:50.702
with his baton so hard
that the baton broke.

42:50.736 --> 42:52.704
Yeah. I-I-I still have a scar.

42:52.738 --> 42:54.873
BLOOM: See? And this
is how tough your dad is.

42:54.906 --> 42:56.174
You did not fight back.

42:56.207 --> 42:57.643
You're right.

42:57.676 --> 42:58.710
Wasn't supposed to.

42:58.744 --> 43:00.211
What's with the slack jaws?

43:00.245 --> 43:01.780
Give the man a beer.

43:01.813 --> 43:03.649
DON: I want to talk about
this reenactment thing.

43:03.682 --> 43:04.916
We're the FBI. I get tear gas.

43:04.950 --> 43:06.251
I mean, you guys are dead.

43:06.284 --> 43:08.153
We can bring a book
of beatnik poetry or something.

43:08.186 --> 43:09.220
ALAN: Yeah.
-Can I make a toast?

43:09.254 --> 43:11.056
DON:
Sure.

43:11.089 --> 43:14.025
To scars--
those we've already earned,

43:14.059 --> 43:15.326
and those that are coming.

43:15.360 --> 43:17.262
ALAN: I'll drink to that.
-Hear, hear.

43:17.295 --> 43:21.099
* Don't be afraid
of what you've learned... *

43:52.898 --> 43:54.099
(gunshot)
