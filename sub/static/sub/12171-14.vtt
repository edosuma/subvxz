07:17.083 --> 07:18.792
You tell me. Five bucks?

07:18.833 --> 07:20.124
That's not for sale.

07:20.125 --> 07:21.188
Merce, everything

07:21.189 --> 07:22.250
that's here is for sale.

07:22.292 --> 07:23.791
Wait, don't sell... no.

07:23.792 --> 07:25.188
I'm about to leap

07:25.189 --> 07:26.583
off the grass

07:26.625 --> 07:28.209
and do, like, an aerial

07:28.210 --> 07:29.792
for this poor little girl

07:29.833 --> 07:31.291
who's here to buy my stuff.

07:31.292 --> 07:32.934
- No, no, no, she's not...
- One second, one second.

07:32.958 --> 07:34.042
Babe. Doesn't, like,

07:34.043 --> 07:35.124
a mother cub

07:35.125 --> 07:37.042
protect her baby cubs

07:37.083 --> 07:38.521
when a stranger

07:38.522 --> 07:39.957
comes among them?

07:39.958 --> 07:41.458
- No, no, no, no.
- She hasn't bought anything.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.792
- She hasn't bought anything yet.
- I'm sorry.

07:43.833 --> 07:44.976
- She hasn't bought
- anything yet.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.042
Sorry, you guys,

07:46.043 --> 07:47.083
the wardrobe rack

07:47.125 --> 07:48.833
- that's over they're
- not for sale.

07:48.836 --> 07:49.999
Oh, this isn't for sale?

07:50.000 --> 07:51.250
She can't let go.

07:51.292 --> 07:52.917
Mj cannot let go of her crap

07:52.958 --> 07:54.458
and it's just crap.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.417
- But all of this stuff
- is available.

07:56.458 --> 07:57.500
- Merce, do you really
- need that?

07:57.503 --> 07:58.833
Do you really need that?

07:58.875 --> 08:00.434
- It's gotta go,
- that's why you called me here.

08:00.458 --> 08:01.999
Like, let me do my job.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.434
- Merce, I don't wanna look
- and I don't wanna hear

08:03.458 --> 08:04.625
The explanation about it.

08:04.667 --> 08:07.000
- I specialize in transformation
- and change.

08:07.003 --> 08:08.351
- That's why I get
- to wear the turban

08:08.375 --> 08:09.458
With the Chanel glasses.

08:09.500 --> 08:11.166
This is what I do, homie.

08:11.167 --> 08:12.476
- That would look
- so cute on you

08:12.500 --> 08:13.500
With, like, a tight belt.

08:13.501 --> 08:14.583
That would be really cute.

08:14.625 --> 08:16.333
- I'm super irritated
- right now.

08:16.336 --> 08:17.792
Why are you irritated?

08:17.833 --> 08:18.833
This is part of the process.

08:18.834 --> 08:20.625
- When you let go,
- it's frustrating,

08:20.667 --> 08:22.101
- You get agitated,
- everybody does.

08:22.125 --> 08:23.438
That's right. You've done

08:23.439 --> 08:24.750
all the work already.

08:24.792 --> 08:25.813
Look at your relationship

08:25.814 --> 08:26.832
with Tommy.

08:26.833 --> 08:28.708
- Your energy
- has shifted so much,

08:28.711 --> 08:30.375
- Like, you're already
- a different person.

08:30.378 --> 08:31.938
I just spent the beginning

08:31.939 --> 08:33.500
of the summer

08:33.542 --> 08:34.875
injecting my body

08:34.876 --> 08:36.208
so that I could freeze my eggs.

08:36.250 --> 08:37.375
- Not worth the wait.
- Baby.

08:37.378 --> 08:39.874
I met a man that I love

08:39.875 --> 08:41.333
and am not freaked out

08:41.375 --> 08:43.458
by the idea of commitment.

08:43.500 --> 08:44.625
Double ds.

08:44.667 --> 08:45.976
- But I'm still having
- a hard time

08:46.000 --> 08:47.541
Letting go of the past,

08:47.542 --> 08:48.855
but I really

08:48.856 --> 08:50.167
want to cut the cord

08:50.208 --> 08:52.125
and just change for the better.

08:52.167 --> 08:53.625
We got this.

08:53.667 --> 08:54.855
The old me would've

08:54.856 --> 08:56.041
never done this.

08:56.042 --> 08:57.583
We look pretty set up.

08:59.375 --> 09:00.708
- This is a professional
- sale right here.

09:00.711 --> 09:02.542
- Merce, merce.
- You guys ready?

09:02.545 --> 09:04.208
- Come on, merce, let's see
- what's going on here.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.354
Okay, I'm gonna

09:05.355 --> 09:06.500
handle this sale.

09:06.542 --> 09:07.813
Let me show you something that

09:07.814 --> 09:09.082
I think that you might like.

09:09.083 --> 09:10.229
Take off your jacket,

09:10.230 --> 09:11.375
put this on.

09:11.417 --> 09:12.646
I feel like this is soft,

09:12.647 --> 09:13.875
it's Rachel Roy.

09:13.917 --> 09:15.708
Oh yeah, this is cute.

09:17.750 --> 09:18.750
Thank you,

09:18.751 --> 09:19.750
you're welcome. Cheers.

09:19.751 --> 09:21.167
25, done.

09:21.168 --> 09:22.582
What about 20?

09:22.583 --> 09:24.750
- You got it, girl.
- That's a good deal, merce.

09:24.753 --> 09:26.250
- Good job.
- I know, I'm letting go.

09:26.253 --> 09:27.542
I'm proud of you.

09:27.583 --> 09:29.875
- Now that I see these people
- wanting the stuff

09:29.917 --> 09:31.749
That I will never ever wear

09:31.750 --> 09:32.792
and thought

09:32.793 --> 09:33.833
that I needed to hoard,

09:33.875 --> 09:35.208
I like this feeling.

09:35.250 --> 09:36.917
- And now, I just wanna
- figure out

09:36.920 --> 09:38.749
How to keep progressing forward.

09:38.750 --> 09:39.917
- Thank you.
- Take care.

09:39.920 --> 09:42.375
You're so welcome.

09:42.417 --> 09:44.083
- Coming up...
- This is for the officiant.

09:44.086 --> 09:45.851
- You're gonna have your ceremony,
- of course.

09:45.875 --> 09:47.917
- But we already... what if we
- already had the ceremony?

09:47.920 --> 09:49.708
- Then you've done
- this backwards.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.750
- Technically,
- we're not married right now.

10:06.292 --> 10:07.334
Do you have your wallet?

10:07.335 --> 10:08.375
Yeah, are you nervous?

10:08.417 --> 10:09.584
No, I just remember

10:09.585 --> 10:10.750
the last time we came here.

10:10.792 --> 10:12.708
- You're gonna be
- a different person today.

10:12.750 --> 10:13.938
You're gonna be

10:13.939 --> 10:15.125
Adam neely farahan

10:15.167 --> 10:17.291
or Adam Joseph farahan.

10:17.292 --> 10:18.583
We had a great wedding.

10:18.625 --> 10:20.209
Asa performed the service,

10:20.210 --> 10:21.791
we're married.

10:21.792 --> 10:22.834
Now we just need

10:22.835 --> 10:23.875
to fill out a form

10:23.917 --> 10:25.188
because Adam wants

10:25.189 --> 10:26.458
to change his last name.

10:26.500 --> 10:27.625
Okay.

10:27.667 --> 10:29.042
He loves my family,

10:29.083 --> 10:30.291
he's learning Farsi.

10:30.292 --> 10:31.393
Like, if it's in the morning,

10:31.417 --> 10:33.167
he'll say, "sobh beh-kheir,"

10:33.208 --> 10:35.250
like, he loves that sh...

10:35.292 --> 10:36.771
I think that's our guy

10:36.772 --> 10:38.250
from last time.

10:38.292 --> 10:40.458
It sure is.

10:40.500 --> 10:41.851
- Next in line please.
- Good morning, gentlemen.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.833
- How's it going?
- Do you remember us?

10:43.875 --> 10:44.958
I do remember you.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.500
Thank you.

10:46.542 --> 10:47.851
- I need to borrow
- both ids again.

10:47.875 --> 10:49.250
Sure thing.

10:49.292 --> 10:51.500
- This is the temporary license,
- just for your review.

10:51.503 --> 10:53.333
- You don't have
- to sign this one.

10:53.375 --> 10:56.000
So I wrote Adam neely farahan.

10:56.042 --> 10:57.105
This is how

10:57.106 --> 10:58.167
you'd like the new name.

10:58.208 --> 10:59.666
Oh.

10:59.667 --> 11:00.999
Stop playing hard to get.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.167
- No.
- You know you've been dying

11:02.170 --> 11:04.083
- To change your name.
- No, well...

11:04.125 --> 11:05.292
Honey.

11:05.293 --> 11:06.458
Adam neely farahan.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.268
- Why don't you change
- your last name

11:09.292 --> 11:11.917
To my last name?

11:11.958 --> 11:13.458
Reza neely?

11:13.500 --> 11:16.708
I do not look like Reza neely.

11:16.750 --> 11:18.667
Plus, one of the advantages

11:18.708 --> 11:21.500
of keeping my last name is,

11:21.542 --> 11:23.375
if we're ever getting hijacked,

11:23.417 --> 11:25.208
they'll be like, "oh, one of us",

11:25.250 --> 11:27.292
like, all good."

11:27.333 --> 11:28.771
Okay, so wait, this is...

11:28.772 --> 11:30.207
This is for the officiant.

11:30.208 --> 11:31.976
- You're gonna have your ceremony,
- of course and [Inaudible]

11:32.000 --> 11:34.042
- But we already... what if we
- already had the ceremony?

11:34.045 --> 11:35.708
- Then you've done
- this backwards.

11:35.750 --> 11:37.958
Oh honey, yeah.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.207
But I was surprising him,

11:39.208 --> 11:40.958
- so we couldn't really
- get the license.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.271
Right. You should get

11:42.272 --> 11:43.542
a license before doing it.

11:47.667 --> 11:49.333
- So this will be
- the official ceremony

11:49.375 --> 11:51.042
That's gonna be performed now

11:51.083 --> 11:53.125
and recorded again by the state

11:53.167 --> 11:54.875
and recognized worldwide

11:54.876 --> 11:56.583
after you're married.

11:56.625 --> 11:58.063
They don't allow

11:58.064 --> 11:59.500
for f... ing surprise weddings

11:59.542 --> 12:01.333
in the state of California,

12:01.375 --> 12:02.563
so technically we're not

12:02.564 --> 12:03.750
married right now.

12:03.792 --> 12:05.000
This is essentially a permit

12:05.001 --> 12:06.208
to get married.

12:06.250 --> 12:08.042
- So did you do
- a church ceremony,

12:08.083 --> 12:10.003
- Did you do just a small
- gathering of friends?

12:10.042 --> 12:11.063
Yeah, we had a friend

12:11.064 --> 12:12.082
get ordained.

12:12.083 --> 12:13.917
- So you get to have
- another ceremony

12:13.920 --> 12:15.416
And celebrate twice.

12:15.417 --> 12:17.167
- So this will be
- the official ceremony

12:17.208 --> 12:18.708
That's gonna be performed now.

12:18.750 --> 12:20.416
Got it. Thank you.

12:20.417 --> 12:22.184
- Congratulations,
- have a wonderful life together.

12:22.208 --> 12:23.917
Thank you.

12:23.958 --> 12:25.063
I feel like

12:25.064 --> 12:26.167
I'm 0 for 2 in weddings.

12:26.208 --> 12:27.833
Call Asa and tell her

12:27.875 --> 12:29.250
we need to have another ceremony

12:29.292 --> 12:32.167
to make it official.

12:32.208 --> 12:34.583
Oh, honey.

12:34.625 --> 12:36.875
[Music playing]

12:55.125 --> 12:57.624
F..., we're losing the light.

12:57.625 --> 12:58.917
I've been working on this

12:58.918 --> 13:00.208
couples portrait project

13:00.250 --> 13:01.334
and originally,

13:01.335 --> 13:02.417
the concept was to shoot

13:02.458 --> 13:03.791
Mike and Jessica together

13:03.792 --> 13:05.000
and now we're shooting him

13:05.001 --> 13:06.208
by himself.

13:06.250 --> 13:07.792
- So, in a way,
- being here today

13:07.833 --> 13:09.292
Finally maybe is understanding

13:09.333 --> 13:10.917
- that the future
- is ahead of him.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.271
So, I'm proud

13:12.272 --> 13:13.583
that he's facing this truth.

13:15.167 --> 13:17.291
Mikey, be really careful.

13:17.292 --> 13:18.375
Come on, babies, come on.

13:18.417 --> 13:19.625
We're losing, like,

13:19.667 --> 13:20.834
four feet of sun

13:20.835 --> 13:21.999
every one minute.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.229
Out of respect

13:23.230 --> 13:24.458
and love for Asa,

13:24.500 --> 13:25.625
I'm participating

13:25.626 --> 13:26.750
in the project

13:26.792 --> 13:29.499
but this is not something

13:29.500 --> 13:30.750
I wanna be a part of

13:30.792 --> 13:33.833
because everyone

13:33.875 --> 13:35.684
- had their significant
- other in the pictures

13:35.708 --> 13:38.125
And there I was with my dogs.

13:38.167 --> 13:39.417
You know inside, I'm crying,

13:39.418 --> 13:40.666
inside, I'm really upset.

13:40.667 --> 13:41.976
- So, let's do it
- real quick here.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.667
- Uh-huh.
- Looking, and look,

13:43.668 --> 13:44.768
You're already in the shadow,

13:44.792 --> 13:45.833
- do you see?
- Yep.

13:45.875 --> 13:47.167
- But I wanna just do it
- and then we'll move

13:47.170 --> 13:48.417
Into the sun more.

13:48.418 --> 13:49.667
Okay. Sit.

13:49.708 --> 13:52.333
Go to your dad.

13:52.375 --> 13:53.563
Come here.

13:53.564 --> 13:54.750
There you go. Feel it.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.333
- Can you face
- the other way now?

13:58.375 --> 14:00.143
- Like you're looking
- at the city, you know?

14:00.167 --> 14:01.271
You're looking

14:01.272 --> 14:02.374
at the path ahead,

14:02.375 --> 14:03.542
your future.

14:03.543 --> 14:04.708
Sit, dowjer.

14:04.750 --> 14:07.874
Dowjer, sit, stay.

14:07.875 --> 14:09.667
Just think about yourself.

14:09.708 --> 14:12.042
There you go, there you go,

14:12.083 --> 14:14.042
- exactly.
- Ahh.

14:14.045 --> 14:15.500
- Yes.
- F...

14:15.542 --> 14:17.500
Yes. Give me more of that.

14:17.542 --> 14:18.625
I have f... ing

14:18.626 --> 14:19.708
tried everything

14:19.750 --> 14:21.708
- to make this work
- at this point,

14:21.750 --> 14:23.292
- To make up
- for the mistakes I made

14:23.333 --> 14:25.083
While we were together,

14:25.084 --> 14:26.833
and I've gotten nothing back.

14:26.875 --> 14:28.250
Give me something

14:28.251 --> 14:29.625
with your arms.

14:29.667 --> 14:30.896
So what do you do?

14:30.897 --> 14:32.125
What do you do?

14:32.167 --> 14:33.851
- How much more
- can you fight for something

14:33.875 --> 14:38.167
That is a lost cause?

14:38.208 --> 14:40.833
Super honest, amazing.

14:46.583 --> 14:48.000
There's an entire life

14:48.001 --> 14:49.416
ahead of you.

14:49.417 --> 14:50.980
I feel like I've failed

14:50.981 --> 14:52.542
at this game

14:52.583 --> 14:53.916
called marriage.

14:53.917 --> 14:55.396
I realize that my relationship

14:55.397 --> 14:56.875
with Jessica is over,

14:56.917 --> 14:58.084
and something

14:58.085 --> 14:59.250
I've invested five years

14:59.292 --> 15:02.000
of my blood, sweat, tears,

15:02.042 --> 15:05.708
my entire heart, is done.

15:05.750 --> 15:06.896
Lex, come here.

15:06.897 --> 15:08.042
Come here, mama.

15:09.750 --> 15:10.792
So this photo shoot

15:10.793 --> 15:11.833
is a funeral for me.

15:11.875 --> 15:13.375
It's the death

15:13.376 --> 15:14.875
of my relationship.

15:14.917 --> 15:16.500
- We're good.
- We're good?

15:16.542 --> 15:17.684
- That was like,
- guerrilla-style.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.208
- That was real
- guerrilla-style.

15:19.250 --> 15:20.583
Thank you, babies.

15:20.625 --> 15:22.250
- I love you.
- I love you.

15:22.253 --> 15:23.688
Alright, I'm gonna head

15:23.689 --> 15:25.124
home now.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.208
Ara, I'll hit you up, okay?

15:26.250 --> 15:27.292
- Okay, go.
- Alright.

15:27.295 --> 15:28.458
- Love you.
- Love you too.

15:28.500 --> 15:29.646
Let's roll.

15:29.647 --> 15:30.791

[Music playing]

15:48.250 --> 15:49.292
Hi.

15:49.333 --> 15:50.917
What is that top?

15:50.958 --> 15:52.375
Is that a cowl neck?

15:52.417 --> 15:53.750
It's just a cozy top.

15:53.792 --> 15:54.792
What's your hair doing?

15:54.833 --> 15:56.457
I don't know, dude.

15:56.458 --> 15:57.833
I honestly

15:57.834 --> 15:59.208
just blow dried it

15:59.250 --> 16:00.958
- and I don't have
- the physical energy

16:01.000 --> 16:03.750
To flat iron it or do anything.

16:03.792 --> 16:05.143
- I'm just like,
- I just clipped it.

16:05.167 --> 16:06.625
- That looks good.
- That looks good.

16:06.667 --> 16:07.667
That looks good.

16:07.668 --> 16:09.167
Okay, so I would like

16:09.168 --> 16:10.666
to invite you

16:10.667 --> 16:13.917
to a party

16:13.958 --> 16:15.417
and I think I'm calling it,

16:15.458 --> 16:16.750
like, a renewal party.

16:16.792 --> 16:18.333
A what party?

16:18.375 --> 16:19.583
Renewal.

16:19.625 --> 16:21.104
Okay, what are you

16:21.105 --> 16:22.583
renewing, your vagina?

16:22.625 --> 16:24.333
- Are you getting
- vag rejuvenation?

16:24.375 --> 16:25.417
You need that more

16:25.418 --> 16:26.458
than me, girl, huh?

16:28.000 --> 16:29.500
- I'm making a transition
- in my life

16:29.542 --> 16:31.167
- And it's a very
- significant one.

16:31.208 --> 16:32.729
This garage sale

16:32.730 --> 16:34.250
was infectious.

16:34.292 --> 16:36.250
I want to keep this going,

16:36.292 --> 16:39.083
so I wanna have a renewal party.

16:39.125 --> 16:40.166
Get rid of my old sh...

16:40.167 --> 16:41.832
And make room for new crap

16:41.833 --> 16:44.000
in the spiritual sense.

16:44.042 --> 16:45.667
I feel like I've reached

16:45.668 --> 16:47.292
a certain point in my life

16:47.333 --> 16:48.771
and I just wanna share it

16:48.772 --> 16:50.207
with my friends, you know?

16:50.208 --> 16:52.375
- It's not that often that people
- do things like this,

16:52.378 --> 16:55.207
But for me, it's important.

16:55.208 --> 16:56.375
Okay.

16:56.417 --> 16:57.684
- I just have been
- through a lot

16:57.708 --> 16:59.542
And now, I just wanna make sure

16:59.583 --> 17:01.167
that I'm giving myself credit

17:01.208 --> 17:03.041
for where I've come,

17:03.042 --> 17:04.292
where I've been

17:04.293 --> 17:05.542
and where I'm going.

17:05.583 --> 17:07.313
Please clear your afternoon,

17:07.314 --> 17:09.041
wear black.

17:09.042 --> 17:10.184
Without giving away too much,

17:10.208 --> 17:12.958
there might be doves,

17:13.000 --> 17:14.479
maybe a casket,

17:14.480 --> 17:15.958
maybe a caballito.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.041
Just kidding.

17:17.042 --> 17:18.707
I just want to have,

17:18.708 --> 17:20.125
like, a thing to commemorate

17:20.126 --> 17:21.542
a rite of passage.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.563
I feel like it's been

17:23.564 --> 17:25.542
an amazing year.

17:25.583 --> 17:26.938
In this moment, my issues

17:26.939 --> 17:28.292
are not with the group,

17:28.333 --> 17:29.749
it's strictly with Reza.

17:29.750 --> 17:31.249
But mj's my friend

17:31.250 --> 17:32.417
and this is an important

17:32.418 --> 17:33.582
thing for her,

17:33.583 --> 17:35.250
so I'm gonna be there

17:35.251 --> 17:36.916
regardless.

17:36.917 --> 17:38.230
I still would consider

17:38.231 --> 17:39.542
the vag rejuvenation.

17:39.583 --> 17:40.813
What about [Inaudible]

17:40.814 --> 17:42.042
Just saying, bye.

Coming up...

17:43.084 --> 17:44.083
I'm not proud of you.

17:44.084 --> 17:46.042
When you are perfect,

17:46.043 --> 17:48.000
I be proud of you.

17:58.083 --> 17:59.229
Your daddies

17:59.230 --> 18:00.375
are getting married today.

18:01.542 --> 18:04.416
We're gonna make it official.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.184
- Hun, can I have a piece
- of paper from here?

18:06.208 --> 18:07.479
Yeah. Although

18:07.480 --> 18:08.749
I should be upset

18:08.750 --> 18:11.250
and feel some sort of failure

18:11.292 --> 18:13.042
because my secret wedding

18:13.043 --> 18:14.791
wasn't legal...

18:14.792 --> 18:16.708
- Let's sing a song.
- [Howl]

18:16.750 --> 18:17.958

18:21.250 --> 18:22.688

18:26.792 --> 18:28.750
- When are these ladies
- gonna get here?

18:28.792 --> 18:30.625
- It better not be persian
- standard time.

18:30.628 --> 18:33.042
Mm-mm. Petey,

18:33.083 --> 18:34.625
- mm-mm, that's not a treat,
- Pete.

- Did anybody call
- a priestess to go?

- Okay, I'm ready
- for everything.

- Okay.
- So...

18:48.083 --> 18:50.457
Where's the license?

18:50.458 --> 18:51.792
- Isn't it that back one,
- that one?

18:51.795 --> 18:54.417
Oh, no, it's this one.

18:54.458 --> 18:55.458
Okay.

18:55.459 --> 18:56.459
Oh, Marty.

18:56.500 --> 18:57.834
Let's see who it is.

18:57.835 --> 18:59.166
She's at least on her way.

18:59.167 --> 19:00.459
I'm not [Inaudible].

Adam and Reza's wedding

19:07.333 --> 19:08.333
is so much fun,

19:08.334 --> 19:09.667
- we're just gonna do
- this every week.

- forever this way.

- No, wait, hun,

- thing first?

Adam. Oh.

19:23.251 --> 19:24.332
What I wrote?

- do that first?

- you guys.

19:29.670 --> 19:30.750
This is kind of what you

19:30.751 --> 19:31.832
wanted in the beginning.

19:31.833 --> 19:34.792
It's complete poetic justice

19:34.833 --> 19:36.188
that, you know,

19:36.189 --> 19:37.541
Adam gets to read his vows,

19:37.542 --> 19:39.188
because best believe

19:39.189 --> 19:40.833
he had something to say

19:40.875 --> 19:42.125
and wanted to say it.

19:42.167 --> 19:43.542
- This is what you wanted.
- Totally, totally.

19:43.545 --> 19:46.207
Yeah. Totally, oh my god.

19:46.208 --> 19:48.000

- that I was always worried

- That he wasn't gonna
- have his voice in this marriage

19:50.375 --> 19:51.458
And now he can,

19:51.500 --> 19:55.374
and so, it's very goosebump-y

19:55.375 --> 19:58.208
and corny and lovely.

19:59.875 --> 20:01.875

take Reza farahan

- to be your lawfully
- wedded partner?

20:50.750 --> 20:53.333
I really just wanted it to be

20:53.375 --> 20:56.916
Adam and I, Asa and mj.

Everything happened exactly

That's my husband,

technically and legally

21:03.125 --> 21:05.291
and by the power vested in us,

that is who the f... he is.

- to prove it, bitches.

- I went ring shopping,

21:34.125 --> 21:35.750
I was almost 30 years old.

21:35.792 --> 21:37.458
- I thought I was gonna
- get engaged,

- to this ring store,

36:33.000 --> 36:34.104
You look fantastic.

36:34.105 --> 36:35.208

36:35.250 --> 36:36.625
Yes.

36:37.583 --> 36:39.208
I love you so much.

36:39.250 --> 36:40.896
Mj, I feel like

36:40.897 --> 36:42.542
she loves me to death

36:42.583 --> 36:44.208
- and she wants to walk
- through fire with me,

36:44.211 --> 36:45.542
Just like I would for her.

36:45.583 --> 36:47.541
She makes me feel important.

36:47.542 --> 36:48.792
Everyday when I wake up

36:48.793 --> 36:50.042
and I see myself in the mirror,

36:50.083 --> 36:51.354
I feel proud of who I am

36:51.355 --> 36:52.625
because I have her.

36:55.542 --> 36:59.167
[Humming]

37:00.125 --> 37:01.354
Hi, merce joon.

37:01.355 --> 37:02.582
Hi, mama.

37:02.583 --> 37:04.083

37:04.125 --> 37:05.250

37:05.253 --> 37:07.083

37:07.086 --> 37:08.167
I love all of you guys

37:08.168 --> 37:09.249
so much.

37:09.250 --> 37:10.500
We love you.

37:15.458 --> 37:17.875
So, today is about renewal,

37:17.917 --> 37:19.167
rebirth,

37:19.208 --> 37:20.729
rejuvenation of yourself.

37:20.730 --> 37:22.250
Amen.

37:22.292 --> 37:23.938
And this is what I had to

37:23.939 --> 37:25.582
do to be here today,

37:25.583 --> 37:28.582
is strip away a lot of ego,

37:28.583 --> 37:30.250
- because persians
- have a lot of it.

37:30.292 --> 37:32.396
All of you guys

37:32.397 --> 37:34.500
have been here with me

37:34.542 --> 37:36.355
through some

37:36.356 --> 37:38.167
of the most challenging,

37:38.208 --> 37:39.957
hardest, darkest,

37:39.958 --> 37:42.957
craziest days of my life.

37:42.958 --> 37:44.375
I'd like to reach out

37:44.376 --> 37:45.792
and acknowledge my friends

37:45.833 --> 37:46.896
and family for the support

37:46.897 --> 37:47.957
that you guys

37:47.958 --> 37:49.438
have all given

37:49.439 --> 37:50.917
and it's really important

37:50.958 --> 37:52.458
that you guys all know.

37:52.500 --> 37:54.226
- One of the best lessons
- that I've learned

37:54.250 --> 37:56.104
Through this process

37:56.105 --> 37:57.957
is letting go and forgiveness.

37:57.958 --> 37:59.458
The point of all

37:59.459 --> 38:00.958
of this is that

38:01.000 --> 38:02.729
when I accept myself

38:02.730 --> 38:04.458
and move forward,

38:04.500 --> 38:07.542
I can get to the next level,

38:07.583 --> 38:09.125
and thank god for that.

38:09.167 --> 38:11.457
Mentally and emotionally,

38:11.458 --> 38:12.708
I wanna close

38:12.709 --> 38:13.958
this chapter in my life,

38:14.000 --> 38:15.625
- but actually,
- physically, literally,

38:15.628 --> 38:17.084
I wanna bring things

38:17.085 --> 38:18.542
and throw them

38:18.583 --> 38:20.042
into the grave

38:20.043 --> 38:21.500
and be done with it.

38:21.542 --> 38:23.332
I used to be all about

38:23.333 --> 38:24.833
the 99-cent type of jewelry

38:24.834 --> 38:26.332
that, you know...

38:26.333 --> 38:27.499
Hell no.

38:27.500 --> 38:29.458
Like, these kinds of, like,

38:29.500 --> 38:31.333
faux-sace and whatever.

38:31.375 --> 38:32.499
But you know what...

38:32.500 --> 38:33.667
The top, the top.

38:33.668 --> 38:34.833
No, no, no, no.

38:36.333 --> 38:38.292
- Oh, yeah, yeah, like this.
- Oh yes.

38:38.333 --> 38:40.583
So we're getting rid of this.

38:40.625 --> 38:42.167
- Done.
- [All cheering]

38:42.170 --> 38:43.934
- We're putting costume
- jewelry in the casket

38:43.958 --> 38:45.563
Because I don't want

38:45.564 --> 38:47.167
fake sh...

38:47.208 --> 38:50.499
I want to invest in real sh...

38:50.500 --> 38:51.832
That lasts forever.

38:51.833 --> 38:54.083
You guys, this represents

38:54.084 --> 38:56.332
more blush, less blush.

38:56.333 --> 38:57.729
Mom, I love you

38:57.730 --> 38:59.125
but you can't make decisions

38:59.167 --> 39:01.500
for me anymore.

39:01.542 --> 39:03.125
- And then this, y'all...
- What?

39:04.772 --> 39:06.374

Because no one,

39:09.042 --> 39:10.417
until Tommy,

39:10.418 --> 39:11.792
did I ever feel like

39:11.833 --> 39:13.104
I don't need this anymore.

39:13.105 --> 39:14.374
What?

39:14.375 --> 39:15.708
- Wow.
- Cheers.

39:15.750 --> 39:16.854
Cheers to that.

39:16.855 --> 39:17.958

Are you gonna

39:26.543 --> 39:27.583

39:28.542 --> 39:30.417
Oh, baby.

39:47.106 --> 39:49.167

all I care about is my future.

39:51.083 --> 39:52.750
Oh, baby.

You make me so happy,

I love you more

40:02.583 --> 40:05.750
every single day and...

40:05.792 --> 40:09.542
The pinnacle of my every day

40:11.583 --> 40:12.667
is when I open my eyes

40:12.708 --> 40:14.500
and see you every morning.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.708
- I wish your father was here.

- Therefore, that's how much

40:24.625 --> 40:27.750
