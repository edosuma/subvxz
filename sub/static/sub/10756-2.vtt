WEBVTT

00:10.207 --> 00:13.005
Baby, baby, all I'm saying
is we should cool it for a while.

00:13.447 --> 00:14.482
No, what's that thing?

00:14.647 --> 00:16.046
"If you love something, let it go.

00:16.207 --> 00:18.277
If it comes back to you..."
Yadda yadda yadda.

00:18.447 --> 00:20.119
Yeah, that's it.

00:20.287 --> 00:22.926
Hey, don't get me wrong,
I'm really broken up about this.

00:23.087 --> 00:25.078
Hey, think fast.

00:25.287 --> 00:26.515
[LAUGHS]

00:29.207 --> 00:31.163
Come on, now...

00:31.567 --> 00:33.523
No tears. No...

00:33.687 --> 00:36.406
I'll never forget you either, Sandy.

00:36.567 --> 00:39.559
Linda? Really?

00:39.727 --> 00:41.479
Well, I thought I was talking
to your sister.

00:41.647 --> 00:43.717
Oh, well, tell her same goes.

00:45.247 --> 00:48.080
- Hey, Frasier, do you have a minute?
- Yes, of course, Roz. What is it?

00:48.247 --> 00:49.726
Well, you're not gonna
like this idea.

00:49.887 --> 00:51.479
You're gonna complain
and make up excuses

00:51.647 --> 00:52.682
and then say no anyway.

00:52.887 --> 00:56.436
That's the very words I would use
to woo my dear Lilith.

00:57.047 --> 00:58.196
Okay, here goes.

00:58.367 --> 01:01.200
I have this friend and I think you two
would really hit it off.

01:01.407 --> 01:03.363
You were wondering if I might
meet her for a drink,

01:03.527 --> 01:05.836
which might lead to dinner,
and after that, who knows where?

01:06.007 --> 01:07.076
Yes, exactly.

01:07.407 --> 01:09.284
Oh, listen, Roz, did you hear that?

01:09.487 --> 01:10.761
What?

01:10.967 --> 01:12.480
If you listen very carefully...

01:12.647 --> 01:15.957
...you can actually hear
my skin crawling.

01:17.327 --> 01:20.603
I know, blind dates stink.
But I'm your friend,

01:20.767 --> 01:22.405
- and I'm worried about you.
- Well, Roz...

01:22.607 --> 01:24.757
When was the last time
you were with a woman?

01:24.967 --> 01:28.004
- Seems like almost a year.
- Oh, it has not been that long.

01:28.167 --> 01:30.442
I mean, that is a laugh.

01:31.487 --> 01:32.886
The last time was...

01:33.767 --> 01:36.235
Well, let me see, the...

01:36.687 --> 01:39.599
Well, the tree was still up.
Oh, God.

01:40.007 --> 01:41.486
Her name is Sharon.
She's 5'7".

01:41.647 --> 01:44.161
- Oh, Roz, I'm not interested.
- But she's an incredible person.

01:44.327 --> 01:47.125
She's smart, she's funny.
She's a former pro golfer.

01:47.287 --> 01:49.801
- She just hasn't met the right guy.
- A woman golfer?

01:49.967 --> 01:52.720
Are we quite certain
there is a right guy?

01:52.927 --> 01:54.565
- She dates men.
- Not this one.

01:54.727 --> 01:57.400
She plays chess.
She loves your show.

01:57.607 --> 01:59.757
I know this isn't supposed to
matter to people like you,

01:59.927 --> 02:01.565
but I've seen her in the shower
at the gym,

02:01.727 --> 02:05.037
she has a body that makes
Bo Derek look like Bo Diddley.

02:06.687 --> 02:08.961
A chess player, did you say?

02:14.207 --> 02:15.560
MARTIN:
Look at these pants.

02:15.727 --> 02:19.163
Oh, dear, Mr. Crane. Did Eddie
drag you through the puddles again?

02:19.367 --> 02:21.039
Every last one of them.

02:21.207 --> 02:23.357
Eddie, get in here.

02:23.567 --> 02:25.205
Eddie, I mean now.

02:27.847 --> 02:31.635
What am I gonna do with you?
My favourite shoes are soaked.

02:34.007 --> 02:35.918
Eddie, look at me
when I'm talking to you.

02:36.127 --> 02:37.845
- You're doing it again.
- What?

02:38.007 --> 02:39.998
You're acting like one of those
nutjobs in the park

02:40.167 --> 02:41.964
- who treat their pets like children.
- Yeah?

02:42.167 --> 02:43.805
Well, when you do it outside,
you're a nut.

02:43.967 --> 02:46.401
When you do it inside,
it's your own damn business.

02:47.047 --> 02:49.686
Eddie, go to your room.

02:51.527 --> 02:55.042
Oh, don't worry about your shoes.
I'll get them all dried out for you.

02:55.207 --> 02:57.767
MARTIN: Well, I hope.
They're not just any shoes, you know.

02:57.967 --> 03:00.959
These are Muckabees,
the most comfortable shoes made.

03:01.127 --> 03:04.642
Air-cushioned insoles,
deep flannel lining.

03:04.807 --> 03:07.116
You know, I remember
one anniversary I surprised Hester

03:07.327 --> 03:09.397
with a pair of Lady Muckabees.

03:09.567 --> 03:12.923
Don't remember which anniversary,
but I know it ended with a zero.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.843
I don't doubt that.

03:22.767 --> 03:25.759
Oh, all right. I forgive you.

03:25.967 --> 03:28.197
I love you too. Yeah.

03:28.367 --> 03:31.677
You'll always be my very best boy.

03:33.527 --> 03:34.516
[WHISTLES]

03:34.687 --> 03:37.406
You know, Dad, there are some
fathers who actually praise their sons

03:37.567 --> 03:39.523
and whistle at their dogs.

03:40.167 --> 03:42.397
- New suit, huh? Who's the lucky girl?
- If you must know,

03:42.607 --> 03:45.246
I'm meeting a friend of Roz's today
after work, but it's no big deal.

03:45.407 --> 03:48.240
Well, congratulations.
What's it been, a year?

03:52.087 --> 03:54.282
It has not been that long.

03:54.487 --> 03:56.523
I remember the tree was still up.

03:58.647 --> 04:01.207
Well, look at you, all got up
like a dog's dinner.

04:01.367 --> 04:05.963
Yes, it's a new suit. Yes, I'm meeting a
woman. And, yes, it has been a while.

04:06.127 --> 04:10.723
Thanks. That reminds me,
I have to order me cards.

04:13.327 --> 04:16.524
Daphne, are you finished here
with the microwave?

04:16.687 --> 04:18.962
Oh, no.

04:22.007 --> 04:24.567
- My Muckabees!
DAPHNE: I'm sorry.

04:24.767 --> 04:26.723
I didn't mean to leave them
in there for so long.

04:26.927 --> 04:30.078
Yes, well, English cooking
strikes again.

04:34.727 --> 04:38.083
You should be happy your patient feels
healthy enough to terminate therapy.

04:38.287 --> 04:41.359
I would, but it's happened so often
lately I find myself in financial straits.

04:41.527 --> 04:43.961
Deep financial straits.

04:44.127 --> 04:48.040
Look at this belt. Spanish leather.

04:48.567 --> 04:52.321
If Mr. Blackwell comes in, I'll create a
diversion, you can make a dash for it.

04:53.447 --> 04:55.756
Obviously the time has come for me
to expand my practice,

04:55.927 --> 04:58.646
<i>so I'm placing an ad
in Seattle Style magazine.</i>

04:59.567 --> 05:02.240
Advertisement? Isn't that a bit
commercial for a psychiatrist?

05:02.447 --> 05:05.405
Said Dr Pot to Dr Kettle.

05:07.767 --> 05:10.600
Besides, a highly respected
obstetrician on my floor did it,

05:10.767 --> 05:14.760
and now his waiting room has more
swollen bellies than a Buddhist temple.

05:14.927 --> 05:16.997
- Good one, yes.
- I liked it.

05:17.167 --> 05:20.842
Here. I'm on my way to call it in,
I just wanted to run it by you.

05:21.007 --> 05:24.602
All right.
"Dr Niles Crane, Jung specialist.

05:24.767 --> 05:28.555
Servicing individuals, couples,
groups. Satisfaction guaranteed.

05:29.567 --> 05:33.401
Tell me where it hurts."
Well, that's just excellent, Niles.

05:33.607 --> 05:35.598
All you're missing now
is a very tasteful cartoon

05:35.767 --> 05:38.884
of you smiling brightly
and holding a shrunken head.

05:39.807 --> 05:42.275
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
I was too distracted by your face

05:42.447 --> 05:44.961
going by on the side of a bus.

05:45.127 --> 05:47.083
I'm off.

05:48.287 --> 05:49.561
- Hey, wild thing.
- Yes, hello.

05:49.767 --> 05:55.285
- Look, we have on the same belt.
- Oh, my God.

05:56.047 --> 05:57.162
- Hi, Roz.
- Hey, Frasier.

05:57.327 --> 05:59.158
- Sharon's gonna be here any minute.
- You didn't say anything, did you?

05:59.327 --> 06:01.363
Not a word. She has no idea
this is a set-up.

06:01.567 --> 06:03.080
Good. Now, listen, if I don't like her,

06:03.247 --> 06:06.444
I will simply excuse myself and leave.
But if like her, I will find some polite

06:06.607 --> 06:09.485
and discreet way of indicating
that you may go.

06:10.647 --> 06:12.080
Beat it, Roz.

06:15.087 --> 06:16.759
ROZ: Hi, Sharon.
- Hi, Roz.

06:16.927 --> 06:19.600
Look who I ran into, my boss,
Dr Frasier Crane.

06:19.767 --> 06:21.439
- Hello.
- This is Sharon Payton.

06:21.607 --> 06:23.518
Pleased to meet you.
I'm a big fan of your show.

06:23.727 --> 06:25.797
- Thank you.
- I'm sure you're tired of hearing that.

06:25.967 --> 06:29.482
- You probably get it all the time.
- Oh, well, not lately.

06:31.767 --> 06:34.918
Listen, Sharon, I'm so sorry to do this,
but I just got a call from the office,

06:35.087 --> 06:38.636
- and it's urgent and I have to go.
- Oh, sure, that's all right.

06:38.847 --> 06:41.725
Well, you know, as long as you're
here, you might as well join me.

06:42.927 --> 06:44.042
That'd be nice.

06:44.247 --> 06:47.284
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye, Roz.

06:48.687 --> 06:51.918
You know, I really do love
listening to your show.

06:52.087 --> 06:54.476
I think it's because you have
such a soothing voice.

06:54.687 --> 06:57.326
What a very kind thing to say.

06:59.287 --> 07:00.640
I almost called in once.

07:00.807 --> 07:03.275
Really? May I ask what
the problem was?

07:03.487 --> 07:09.642
Well, I'm terribly competitive, which is
great for sports, I used to play pro golf,

07:09.807 --> 07:11.763
but sometimes it seeps
into my personal life.

07:11.967 --> 07:14.527
Well, I don't really think
that's too great a problem,

07:14.687 --> 07:17.155
but if I were to make
a recommendation, it might be to...

07:17.327 --> 07:19.887
...start seeing a therapist.

07:20.087 --> 07:21.315
Whoa.

07:21.487 --> 07:23.000
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Hi, Bulldog.

07:23.167 --> 07:26.603
Not you. Hey, aren't you
gonna introduce me?

07:26.767 --> 07:29.201
- Well, actually, I wasn't, no.
- Bob Brisco.

07:29.407 --> 07:31.045
- Sharon Payton.
- Yes, good to see you.

07:31.207 --> 07:32.925
- Don't be a stranger.
- Hey, wait a minute.

07:33.127 --> 07:35.800
Wait a minute. Sharon Payton.
I know you.

07:35.967 --> 07:39.039
LPGA, you won
the Denver Open, 1992.

07:39.247 --> 07:42.444
1992. That was a fabulous year for a
particular Chambertin I took a shine to...

07:42.607 --> 07:46.282
I know you too. You're that guy
that said golf is not a sport.

07:46.487 --> 07:47.840
- Well, it's not.
- Really?

07:48.007 --> 07:52.683
Yeah. No cheerleaders, no blood, the
only cups involved are in the ground.

07:52.887 --> 07:56.004
This reminds me of a debate I had with
my brother Niles about whether or not

07:56.167 --> 07:57.759
Stephen Sondheim
is really light opera.

07:57.927 --> 08:00.157
You know, I have a theory that people
who put down golf

08:00.327 --> 08:02.283
do so because they can't play well.

08:02.487 --> 08:04.557
- Is that a challenge?
- It might be.

08:04.767 --> 08:06.564
If we leave now,
we could get in nine holes.

08:06.727 --> 08:08.683
- Loser buys dinner.
- I got a nine handicap.

08:08.887 --> 08:11.196
You're on. Frasier, would you like
to join us?

08:11.407 --> 08:14.763
- Well, no, I don't play.
- Well, it was really nice meeting you.

08:14.967 --> 08:16.878
- Likewise.
- I'll get my coat.

08:17.047 --> 08:20.164
Bulldog. Listen, Roz set this up
that I might meet Sharon.

08:20.327 --> 08:22.318
Things were going
in a very positive direction.

08:22.487 --> 08:24.603
Yeah, well, things seem
to have changed, haven't they?

08:24.767 --> 08:28.396
- What do you call that? Irony?
- Is there nothing I can do

08:28.567 --> 08:31.559
- to appeal to your sense of decency?
- Hey, I have no sense of decency.

08:31.767 --> 08:33.485
That way, my other senses
are enhanced.

MARTIN:
But the real secret of Muckabees

08:43.687 --> 08:46.485
is that they mould themselves
to the shape of your foot.

08:46.687 --> 08:49.121
Now, my problem was always
hammertoes.

08:49.287 --> 08:52.040
If you had hammertoes, you'd have
a hell of a time finding shoes.

08:52.207 --> 08:55.756
But Muckabees fit over
my hammertoes like a glove.

08:58.807 --> 09:00.684
Funny, you know,
when you're young,

09:00.847 --> 09:03.645
you dream about fame and fortune.
When you get to be my age,

09:03.807 --> 09:06.719
all you really want out of life
is a comfy pair of shoes.

09:06.927 --> 09:11.079
Right now I'd settle for never hearing
the word "hammertoes" again.

09:11.287 --> 09:14.404
Hey, don't give me any attitude.
Wasn't me that nuked the Muckabees.

09:14.607 --> 09:16.723
I'm not the one who can't remember
where the store is

09:16.887 --> 09:19.879
- where you bought the damn shoes.
- Just drive. I'll tell you when to stop.

09:20.087 --> 09:22.078
Stop!

09:22.727 --> 09:25.036
- Is that it?
- It's a red light.

09:26.807 --> 09:30.880
- In this country, we stop for those.
- All right, all right.

09:31.327 --> 09:34.876
- Woman driver.
- Hammertoes.

09:44.727 --> 09:46.763
Frasier.

09:49.087 --> 09:52.477
What? Haven't you
spoken with Sharon?

09:52.647 --> 09:55.923
I tried, but she wasn't home
all weekend.

09:56.087 --> 09:58.282
Frasier.

09:58.487 --> 10:01.843
Look, before you snap my behind
with a wet towel,

10:02.007 --> 10:06.080
the last time I saw Sharon was leaving
Cafë Nervosa with Bulldog.

10:06.287 --> 10:08.005
Frasier! How could you
let that happen?

10:08.167 --> 10:11.125
Well, I don't know. The whole thing
is sort of a blur. We were talking about

10:11.287 --> 10:14.085
golf and something called a handicap,
the next thing I know, I'm sitting

10:14.247 --> 10:17.717
with a cappuccino, muttering to myself
in a very soothing voice.

10:18.287 --> 10:20.198
- I'm sorry.
- Well, it's all right, Roz.

10:20.367 --> 10:23.006
It's just the whole thing just
catapulted me back to high school.

10:23.167 --> 10:26.318
You've only known me as an adult,
but back then I was rather

10:26.487 --> 10:29.240
- an unathletic, bookish sort.
- Get out.

10:29.727 --> 10:31.160
Jocks were the bane
of my existence.

10:31.367 --> 10:35.076
They called me a weenie, and they
would steal all the girls that I wanted.

10:35.247 --> 10:38.080
Oh, Frasier, you must have had
some girlfriends.

10:38.247 --> 10:41.762
Friends, yeah. Yeah, any time they
wanted a sensitive shoulder to cry on,

10:41.967 --> 10:44.561
but some blockheaded pillar
of testosterone would come and it was:

10:44.727 --> 10:47.321
"Bye, Fras,
maybe we can study later."

10:48.487 --> 10:51.206
<i>Then I'd head home to Niles and we'd
put on the Brandenburg Concertos</i>

10:51.367 --> 10:54.962
and play air violin.

10:57.927 --> 11:00.487
Gee, what a couple of nerdlingers.

11:00.687 --> 11:03.042
Oh, and I suppose you were
Miss Popular in high school.

11:03.247 --> 11:06.284
- I would say yes.
- I'm guessing that explains why too.

11:09.287 --> 11:11.278
Hey, guys.

11:11.487 --> 11:12.636
[BULLDOG GIGGLES]

11:12.807 --> 11:16.322
- What a weekend.
- Listen, Bulldog, Sharon is my friend,

11:16.487 --> 11:20.036
- and you better not hurt her.
- What...? Hurt her?

11:20.207 --> 11:22.960
I am crazy about her.

11:23.127 --> 11:25.277
I never felt this way before.

11:25.447 --> 11:27.597
You know, on my way to work,

11:27.767 --> 11:30.839
all these songs on the radio
suddenly made sense to me.

11:32.887 --> 11:37.039
Have you ever listened to the words
to "Time In A Bottle"?

11:37.207 --> 11:39.880
It is so beautiful, man,
I had to pull over.

11:40.087 --> 11:42.078
Oh, my God, it's in love.

11:43.247 --> 11:46.239
And last night,
for the first time in my life,

11:47.007 --> 11:49.157
I actually said those
three little words:

11:49.367 --> 11:51.676
"Stay for breakfast."

11:51.887 --> 11:54.765
- You had sex with Sharon?
- Doc, please.

11:55.247 --> 11:59.559
We made love. You know what?
I gotta call her.

11:59.727 --> 12:01.604
No, wait, no, I gotta play hard to get.

12:02.287 --> 12:05.677
But I miss the sound of her voice.
I'm calling her. No, wait, it's too needy.

12:05.847 --> 12:08.441
Chicks hate that. I shouldn't call her.

12:08.847 --> 12:12.237
But I want to. Doc, what should I do?

12:12.447 --> 12:15.519
Don't ask me.
I don't even know who you are.

12:19.607 --> 12:22.041
This was it.
This was the Muckabees store.

12:22.207 --> 12:24.675
Now it's gone and so are
the only shoes I ever loved.

12:24.887 --> 12:26.320
Mr Crane, look at me.

12:26.487 --> 12:30.002
We're talking here about something
that's old and smelly and dirty.

12:30.167 --> 12:31.395
MAN:
Hey.

12:33.247 --> 12:35.363
Not you. We're talking
about Muckabees.

12:35.567 --> 12:39.355
Oh, great shoes.
Used to sell them here.

12:39.567 --> 12:41.797
- What happened to the store?
- Moved.

12:42.007 --> 12:45.682
- Do you know where?
- Yeah. It'll cost you.

12:46.447 --> 12:51.123
- How much?
- No, not money. I want a kiss.

12:51.527 --> 12:52.846
What?

12:53.007 --> 12:55.157
- You heard him.
- Mr Crane.

12:55.327 --> 12:58.000
You burned them, you owe me.
It's only a kiss.

12:58.207 --> 13:00.482
Not her.

13:06.647 --> 13:10.845
This is Dr Frasier Crane,
KACL 780 talk radio.

13:11.047 --> 13:12.275
Thought you'd never finish.

13:12.447 --> 13:14.915
You know, Niles, what say I buy us
dinner and a lot of martinis.

13:15.087 --> 13:17.282
Sounds great except
for the dinner part.

13:17.727 --> 13:20.764
- I take it you had a bad day too?
- I had an abysmal day.

13:20.927 --> 13:23.600
- Remember the ad I placed?
- Oh, yes. Dr Niles Crane,

13:23.767 --> 13:27.123
- Jung specialist, blah blah blah.
- Well, they've made a tiny little typo.

13:27.287 --> 13:29.278
See if you can find it.

13:30.807 --> 13:34.004
"Niles Crane, hung specialist."

13:37.527 --> 13:38.846
Oh, my.

13:39.847 --> 13:41.360
The rest they got perfectly.

13:41.527 --> 13:44.883
"Servicing individuals, couples,

13:46.527 --> 13:48.483
groups.

13:49.407 --> 13:52.160
Satisfaction guaranteed.

13:52.767 --> 13:54.997
Tell me where it hurts."

13:59.327 --> 14:02.046
Well, any calls?

14:02.247 --> 14:04.044
- It's a telethon.
- Yes, well...

14:04.207 --> 14:07.279
- We'll start with double martinis.
- All right.

14:08.407 --> 14:11.444
Wait a second. I need the name of one
of those fancy restaurants you go to.

14:11.607 --> 14:14.519
Hey, hi, Sharon, it's me, Bob.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.803
Hey, I had a great time last night.

14:16.967 --> 14:18.844
Listen, how about dinner tonight?

14:19.567 --> 14:21.046
You do?

14:21.407 --> 14:23.967
All right, how about tomorrow night?

14:25.047 --> 14:29.279
Hey, it's a good thing I'm not paranoid,
I'd think you were dumping me.

14:30.007 --> 14:32.157
Well, I walked into that one.

14:33.887 --> 14:37.357
Yeah, me too. Good luck, Shar...

14:38.247 --> 14:41.922
- Gee, I'm sorry, Bulldog.
- Me too.

14:42.087 --> 14:44.965
I'll call Francois, see if he can
get us a table on the patio.

14:45.167 --> 14:48.159
- Ten seconds, Bulldog.
- Oh, right, right, right.

14:48.327 --> 14:51.603
- Listen, are you gonna be all right?
- What, me? Are you kidding?

14:51.767 --> 14:53.439
I'm the Bulldog.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.880
Attention, sports fans,
you're in the Doghouse.

14:57.047 --> 14:58.082
[BARKING]

14:58.247 --> 15:02.081
Uh...
First, some weekend scores.

15:02.247 --> 15:06.286
In football, the Packers
crushed the Saints 42-10,

15:06.447 --> 15:10.804
and the 49ers humiliated
the Patriots 35-7.

15:10.967 --> 15:12.878
And in golf...

15:13.687 --> 15:16.759
Golf, hey, golf sucks, right?
Go to calls.

15:16.927 --> 15:19.919
You're in the Doghouse.
Put on a flea collar.

15:20.287 --> 15:21.640
We have the table,
but Francois says

15:21.807 --> 15:23.923
- he can only hold it for ten minutes.
- In a minute.

15:24.087 --> 15:25.645
<i>MAN 1 [ON SPEAKER]:
Anyway, what's up with the rumour</i>

15:25.807 --> 15:28.560
<i>that the Seahawks are thinking
of leaving Seattle again?</i>

15:28.727 --> 15:30.285
I have no respect for that, man.

15:30.767 --> 15:34.282
Anyone who has their fun,
then they just leave you,

15:34.447 --> 15:37.803
well, hey, to hell with them, right?
We'll get another team.

15:37.967 --> 15:41.596
A team that... A team that
won't ever leave us.

15:41.767 --> 15:44.122
A team we can love forever.

15:44.327 --> 15:46.795
- You'd better go to commercial.
- I already did.

15:47.527 --> 15:49.199
Bulldog, are you gonna be all right?

15:49.607 --> 15:51.120
Do you think you can tape the show?

15:52.687 --> 15:55.645
<i>Wait, Bulldog, we need a tape.
Where's the Best of Bulldog?</i>

15:55.847 --> 15:57.724
She took the best of Bulldog.

15:58.527 --> 16:02.042
- We've got dead air in 15 seconds.
- Oh, great. Okay, I'll go get Bulldog.

16:02.207 --> 16:05.165
- You take over the show.
- Me? A sports show?

16:05.367 --> 16:07.676
You're the only one here.

16:13.287 --> 16:14.561
[HONKS]

16:14.727 --> 16:18.037
Okay, sports enthusiasts,
this is Dr Frasier Crane

16:18.207 --> 16:20.721
filling in for Bob "Bulldog" Brisco.

16:22.447 --> 16:24.563
<i>- You're on the air.
MAN 2: This is Mike.</i>

16:24.727 --> 16:26.718
<i>I wanted to talk to Bulldog,
but you'll do.</i>

16:26.887 --> 16:29.879
<i>So, what's your take on
the damn Yankees this season?</i>

16:30.047 --> 16:34.882
Are you speaking of the frothy musical
adaptation of the Faustian myth

16:35.207 --> 16:37.516
or the baseball team
of which I know nothing?

16:38.127 --> 16:40.197
<i>MAN 2:
What a weenie.</i>

16:40.687 --> 16:42.917
Doesn't that take me back.

16:43.207 --> 16:45.641
But he brings up a good point.
You see, while I'm on the air,

16:45.807 --> 16:49.197
please feel free to call in about
anything other than sports. Please.

16:50.127 --> 16:51.685
Hello, you're on the air.

16:51.887 --> 16:53.957
<i>MAN 3: You think it was
a good idea for the Sonics</i>

16:54.127 --> 16:55.321
<i>to give up those draft choices</i>

16:55.487 --> 16:57.318
<i>so they could free up some money

16:57.487 --> 17:00.718
<i>You know, to go after a wide body
to help them in the paint?</i>

17:02.367 --> 17:04.278
Yes.

17:06.847 --> 17:08.838
You're on the air.

17:09.047 --> 17:11.196
Bulldog!

17:11.367 --> 17:15.121
I know you're in there. Get out here.

17:15.287 --> 17:20.315
Give me a break, Leonard. Like you
haven't fantasized about this moment.

17:20.967 --> 17:23.435
BULLDOG: Go away, Roz.
- Will you grow up.

17:23.607 --> 17:25.165
So you got dumped.

17:25.367 --> 17:28.757
You got a little payback for the way
you treated women all your life.

17:28.927 --> 17:33.000
Besides, the Bulldog I know
doesn't get sad.

17:33.167 --> 17:35.078
- He gets angry.
BULLDOG: You're right.

17:35.807 --> 17:40.119
This stinks! This is total, total B.S.

17:42.327 --> 17:45.478
If you don't come out in the next three
seconds, I'm gonna reach in there

17:45.647 --> 17:49.799
- and drag you out by your ankles.
- Hello, Roz, playing hard to get?

17:51.767 --> 17:54.406
It's Bulldog. You're a psychiatrist.
Help him.

17:54.607 --> 17:57.804
As distressed as I am by his condition,
he's not the only one suffering here.

17:57.967 --> 18:00.037
In eight minutes we are going
to lose our patio table.

18:00.207 --> 18:03.563
Well, as long as Frasier's filling in
for Bulldog, you're not going anywhere.

18:03.727 --> 18:05.524
You poor man. Help is at hand.

18:06.887 --> 18:09.560
BULLDOG:
No! No shrinks! I hate shrinks.

18:09.727 --> 18:12.002
You're all a bunch of
wimps, weirdos.

18:12.727 --> 18:14.683
Help me.

18:16.047 --> 18:18.880
There, there. I'm here for you.

18:19.047 --> 18:21.880
And you're over there for me.

18:24.407 --> 18:27.126
Well, I sense you're
in a great deal of pain.

18:27.287 --> 18:29.926
- Yeah. Make it stop.
- No.

18:30.127 --> 18:32.436
No, the first step toward healing
is not to bury the pain,

18:32.607 --> 18:34.086
but to feel it at its fullest depths.

18:34.287 --> 18:36.198
[SCREAMS]

18:38.447 --> 18:41.678
Okay, well, before security arrives,
let's skip on to step two.

18:43.087 --> 18:45.806
- What is going on?
- Excuse me. Frasier, we're in session.

18:45.967 --> 18:48.276
We have to pull him together
in minutes, not in a lifetime.

18:48.527 --> 18:52.600
- How dare you talk to me like that.
- We don't have time for this. Get out!

18:52.807 --> 18:54.399
Bulldog, I'm referring you
to my brother.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.637
I'll call Francois and tell him
there's been a death.

18:56.807 --> 18:59.037
That ought to buy us
another ten minutes.

18:59.207 --> 19:02.244
We're on a newsbreak. You have got
to pull yourself together because

19:02.407 --> 19:04.363
there is no way I am enduring
any more humiliation.

19:04.527 --> 19:06.677
- I am not going out there, man.
- You have got to.

19:06.847 --> 19:09.759
I can't even decipher the abbreviations
on the score sheets. I'm guessing

19:09.927 --> 19:13.442
by your producer's guffaws that it is
not the Cleveland Independents.

19:15.487 --> 19:18.638
I just never felt this way
about a chick before.

19:20.247 --> 19:23.478
I was even thinking about
her and me having kids.

19:23.807 --> 19:26.719
- Isn't that scary?
- Positively bone-chilling.

19:27.487 --> 19:30.638
- It hurts like hell.
- I know. I know, Bulldog.

19:30.807 --> 19:34.197
You know, often through pain
we can achieve emotional growth.

19:34.367 --> 19:36.517
It reminds me of a paper
I recently presented

19:36.687 --> 19:38.837
to the Vancouver Psychiatric
Association. The gravamen

19:39.007 --> 19:41.475
of my discourse was that
the sufferer, i.e. You...

19:41.647 --> 19:44.366
Doc, doc, you're hurting
my head here.

19:44.567 --> 19:48.162
Can't you stop being a shrink
and just be, like, a guy?

19:48.367 --> 19:50.005
Like a guy.

19:53.327 --> 19:55.283
Like a guy.

19:56.807 --> 19:58.718
Screw her!

20:00.007 --> 20:01.645
- What?
- Yeah, you don't need her.

20:01.807 --> 20:03.445
She's trash!

20:04.127 --> 20:06.561
- Yeah, trash.
- You're better off! We both are!

20:06.767 --> 20:08.564
- I like the sound of this.
- Yeah, so do I!

20:08.727 --> 20:11.195
It's unattractive, yet liberating.
Like the one and only time

20:11.367 --> 20:13.244
I wore a European bathing suit.

20:13.447 --> 20:17.804
- Oh, I'm sorry. She's a bitch!
- Hey, she wasn't even that hot.

20:18.007 --> 20:20.396
All she did was save you
the trouble of having to dump her.

20:20.607 --> 20:22.404
- I never thought about that.
- There you go.

20:22.567 --> 20:24.000
- I'm feeling a little better.
- That's right.

20:24.167 --> 20:25.566
- Thanks.
- Come on.

20:25.727 --> 20:27.445
- It's great talking to you.
- Likewise.

20:27.607 --> 20:30.565
You know, I could talk like this
for another 30 seconds.

20:31.287 --> 20:32.322
She was nothing!

20:32.487 --> 20:35.001
- She was less than nothing!
- Yeah, right.

20:35.167 --> 20:36.839
Tomorrow you're gonna find
somebody even hotter,

20:37.047 --> 20:38.526
and you know
what you're gonna do?

20:38.687 --> 20:42.566
You're gonna have your fun with her
and dump her just for the hell of it!

20:43.887 --> 20:45.718
- Yeah, dump her!
- And you know what?

20:45.887 --> 20:48.196
You're not gonna feel bad
about it at all. You know why?

20:48.367 --> 20:51.086
Because we're guys,
and that's what guys do!

20:53.087 --> 20:55.601
Distressing news, Frasier.
Francois gave away our table.

20:55.807 --> 20:57.286
Screw him!

20:58.087 --> 20:59.440
- Excuse me?
- You heard me!

20:59.647 --> 21:02.286
We don't need him or his stinky little
restaurant. There are plenty

21:02.447 --> 21:06.281
of restaurants. I say we go somewhere
we don't even need a reservation!

21:09.047 --> 21:10.685
- Thank you, Niles.
- You're welcome.

21:10.887 --> 21:14.562
If we hasten, perhaps we can catch
the first seating at Monsieur Galbolon.
