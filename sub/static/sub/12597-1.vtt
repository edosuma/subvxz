00:05.506 --> 00:09.341
Lately, things have been pretty
crazy for my sister, maddie.

00:09.343 --> 00:11.343
Her boyfriend, diggie,
told her that he was going

00:11.345 --> 00:13.612
To study abroad
in australia for a semester,

00:13.614 --> 00:16.548
<i>And that did not</i>
<i>go over very well.</i>

00:16.550 --> 00:18.584
Maddie, maybe
we should break up.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.219
Wow.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.322
Joey:
<i>Boo, diggie!</i>

00:24.558 --> 00:26.191
But he realized something.

00:26.193 --> 00:28.260
He had made a mistake.

00:28.262 --> 00:29.862
What are you saying?

00:29.863 --> 00:31.463
I want to get back
together with her.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.365
Whoa.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.434
Okay, but, liv, do you think
that she'd take me back?

00:35.436 --> 00:37.436
-Uh...
-Because if she will,
i'm not gonna leave.

00:37.438 --> 00:38.704
Okay, you know what?

00:38.706 --> 00:40.439
You just sit
by the paulie statue,

00:40.441 --> 00:42.841
And i will go get maddie
before you leave.

00:42.843 --> 00:46.512
Joey:
<i>But i might have</i>
<i>made it slightly impossible.</i>

00:46.514 --> 00:47.946
-Oh!
-(crashing)

00:49.483 --> 00:51.717
She managed to get out
of the locker room.

00:51.719 --> 00:54.420
But (gasps) oh no,
was it too late?

00:55.456 --> 00:56.622
Diggie, am i too late?

00:56.624 --> 00:58.290
<i>Was diggie waiting for her</i>

00:58.292 --> 01:00.325
<i>Or had he already left</i>
<i>for australia?</i>

01:00.327 --> 01:02.694
Aren't you just dying
to find out?

01:02.696 --> 01:03.896
Oh, you are dying?

01:03.898 --> 01:06.231
Okay, well then let's
get to it, friend!

01:09.303 --> 01:10.636

Hey, um...

02:11.899 --> 02:13.398
Have you heard from maddie?

02:13.400 --> 02:15.501
'cause she's not
answering her phone.

02:15.502 --> 02:17.603
How can you worry about maddie
when my favorite show

02:17.605 --> 02:19.438
<i>Linda and heather</i> ,
just finished its season

02:19.440 --> 02:21.907
With an unresolved cliffhanger?

02:21.909 --> 02:23.709
Please come back!

02:23.711 --> 02:24.776
Without my favorite show,

02:24.778 --> 02:26.578
Where am i gonna
get my drama fix?

02:26.580 --> 02:28.347
I need my drama!

02:29.917 --> 02:31.483
(door opens)

02:32.987 --> 02:34.786
Hey.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.388
What happened with diggie?

02:36.390 --> 02:38.357
He left.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.025
Diggie left.

02:40.027 --> 02:41.660
Maddie...

02:43.430 --> 02:45.097
I'm so sorry.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.368
(sniffing)

02:49.370 --> 02:51.403
Do i smell drama?

02:53.507 --> 02:55.591
You know what?

02:55.592 --> 02:57.676
Maybe this one just
wasn't meant to be.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.111
Yeah.

02:59.113 --> 03:00.379
I guess not.

03:00.381 --> 03:02.481
I mean...

03:02.483 --> 03:05.417
If the universe had wanted
me and diggie to be together,

03:05.419 --> 03:07.386
Joey never
would have been born

03:07.388 --> 03:08.887
And he couldn't
do stupid things!

03:08.889 --> 03:11.490
-Joey!
-Maddie!

03:11.492 --> 03:14.426
Maddie, i was trying
to call you.

03:14.428 --> 03:16.395
Oh, that's so funny
'cause my phone is actually

03:16.397 --> 03:18.964
Trapped inside a locker
that you knocked over, so...

03:18.966 --> 03:21.400
Okay, before you kick,
bite, or punch me,

03:21.402 --> 03:23.569
Please just hear me out.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.437
Maddie, there's still a chance
that you could see diggie

03:25.439 --> 03:26.672
Before he leaves for australia.

03:28.475 --> 03:30.475
Suddenly, i'm entertained.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.380
Diggie flew
to los angeles first

03:35.382 --> 03:36.515
Where he has
a really long layover.

03:36.517 --> 03:37.816
What are you saying?

03:37.818 --> 03:39.084
I'm saying that
he doesn't leave

03:39.086 --> 03:41.486
For australia
until tomorrow morning.

03:41.488 --> 03:42.854
So if we hop
on a plane right now,

03:42.856 --> 03:44.156
We can catch him in la.

03:45.092 --> 03:47.593
Ooh, exotic locations?

03:47.595 --> 03:49.394
This just keeps getting better!

03:50.831 --> 03:52.798
Hold on,
why would you be going?

03:52.800 --> 03:54.566
'cause i didn't get
to say goodbye

03:54.568 --> 03:55.968
To diggie either, maddie!

03:55.970 --> 03:57.669
Okay.

03:57.671 --> 04:00.405
Maddie, you have to go.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.424
Okay, but what about
mom and dad?

04:02.425 --> 04:04.442
It's not like they're just gonna
let me fly across the country.

04:04.445 --> 04:05.577
Then you just don't tell them.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.778
-Wha--
-i'm gonna cover for you.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.113
You go.

04:09.683 --> 04:10.949
Maddie, let's go.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.551
Okay.

04:12.553 --> 04:13.752
Okay.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.006
Oh, um...

04:18.007 --> 04:19.423
You don't seriously think
you're gonna get through

04:19.426 --> 04:21.460
Airport security
dressed like that, do you?

04:21.462 --> 04:24.029
I'd rather take my chances
with them than with you.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.536
Morning, liv.

04:31.538 --> 04:33.505
(laughs)

04:33.507 --> 04:35.674
Why are you eating
popcorn for breakfast?

04:35.676 --> 04:38.143
Because i'm waiting
to see how you explain

04:38.145 --> 04:39.945
To mom and dad
that last night their kids flew

04:39.947 --> 04:41.747
Across the country
without permission.

04:41.749 --> 04:44.616
Good or bad, it's gonna
be great entertainment!

04:45.953 --> 04:48.003
That's gonna be easy.

04:48.004 --> 04:50.054
I'm just gonna tell the 'rents
that maddie's upset about diggie

04:50.057 --> 04:52.057
And wants to be alone
all day in her room

04:52.059 --> 04:53.925
And only her twin sister
is allowed in.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.894
Boom! Handled.

04:57.097 --> 04:59.164
Karen:
Liv and maddie,
could you come in here?

04:59.166 --> 05:01.066
Here we go!

05:03.637 --> 05:04.503
Hey!

05:04.505 --> 05:06.605
-Oh.
-What's up, mom?

05:06.607 --> 05:08.557
So, where is maddie?

05:08.558 --> 05:10.508
I wanna know what happened
with diggie last night.

05:10.511 --> 05:11.610
Oh.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.145
Yeah, it's actually sad news.

05:13.147 --> 05:15.647
-He did leave for australia.
-(gasps)

05:15.649 --> 05:17.816
She is gonna need her momma.

05:19.553 --> 05:22.020
-Yes. Well, she is upstairs--
-not in her room.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.655
-I checked.
-Oh.

05:24.958 --> 05:27.492
Right. No, not in her room.

05:27.494 --> 05:28.960
Um, she...

05:28.962 --> 05:30.662
Is in the...

05:30.664 --> 05:32.130
-The kitchen.
-The kitchen.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.232
The kitchen?

05:34.234 --> 05:36.168
-The kitchen.
-Right.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.503
Oh, yeah. The kitchen.
(nervous laugh)

05:38.505 --> 05:39.838
Although, i don't really know

05:39.840 --> 05:42.574
Why my broken-hearted sister
would be hiding

05:42.576 --> 05:44.876
Away in the busiest room
in the house.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.512
Well, she's cleaning the fridge.

05:47.514 --> 05:51.550
-She'll be at it all day.
-That's right. All d--

05:53.554 --> 05:54.720
All day?

05:54.721 --> 05:55.887
This is better
than <i> linda and heather</i> .

05:55.889 --> 05:59.558
The characters do
my bidding and my chores!

05:59.560 --> 06:01.793
Well, i'll go check
on her.

06:01.795 --> 06:06.064
Okay-- oh, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

06:06.066 --> 06:09.935
Um, see, she still
needs just so much space.

06:09.937 --> 06:13.705
-Oh.
-She said she could really
only handle seeing me, so...

06:13.707 --> 06:15.357
Oh.

06:15.358 --> 06:17.008
Does she need
her kid brother, too?

06:17.010 --> 06:18.577
No. You've done quite enough.

06:19.646 --> 06:22.714
Well, i mean, what are
we gonna do about breakfast?

06:22.716 --> 06:23.615
Oh, liv will get that.

06:23.617 --> 06:24.716
I gotta poop.

06:27.955 --> 06:31.823
I didn't really have to go,
but i had to get to the kitchen

06:31.825 --> 06:33.091
Without mom knowing.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.926
No one questions poop, yo.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.732
Did i miss anything?
Did i miss anything?

06:41.735 --> 06:43.034
How am i supposed to keep

06:43.036 --> 06:44.936
Mom and dad out
of the kitchen all day?

06:44.938 --> 06:46.304
I don't know,

06:46.306 --> 06:47.739
But i can't wait for find out!

06:50.077 --> 06:51.977
Karen:
Maddie, honey, it's your momma.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.278
How are you?

06:54.715 --> 06:56.181
She's fine, mom!

06:56.183 --> 06:57.249
Karen:
No, no, no.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.084
I need to hear it from her.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.123
Um...

07:06.226 --> 07:07.859
(imitates maddie)
i'm fine, mom!

07:07.861 --> 07:10.629
Thanks... Dude!

07:12.065 --> 07:14.132
(as herself)
oh, maddie, mom wants breakfast.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.168
(as maddie)
doesn't she know that i'm sad

07:16.170 --> 07:17.769
And i need to be alone?

07:19.306 --> 07:21.106
(as herself)
she's just worried about you!

07:21.108 --> 07:22.741
(as maddie)
i know. I just...

07:22.743 --> 07:24.943
I need my space.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.781
Karen:
You take all the time
and space you need.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.617
Just know momma loves you.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.289
(phone rings)

07:37.291 --> 07:38.890
Hey, becky! What's up?

07:38.892 --> 07:41.126
<i>Liv, strap yourself in.</i>

07:41.128 --> 07:45.397
<i>The bic has a career-making-</i>
<i>slap-your-own-face-if-you-miss-</i>
<i>this opportunity.</i>

07:45.399 --> 07:48.900
<i>It's a superhero show</i>
<i>called </i> voltage<i> !</i>

07:48.902 --> 07:50.068
Parker:
<i>Voltage?</i>

07:50.070 --> 07:51.887
That's my favorite comic book.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.705
It's about a high school girl
who's struck by lightning.

07:56.210 --> 07:57.276
Zap! Bam!

07:57.277 --> 07:58.343
<i>And she gets</i>
<i>the power of electricity</i>

07:58.345 --> 08:00.946
<i>To save the universe</i>
<i>and her high school.</i>

08:02.249 --> 08:05.650
<i>Hollywood wants you back, liv.</i>

08:05.652 --> 08:08.687
Becky, that sounds really great.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.422
But i do want to stay

08:10.424 --> 08:12.924
In stevens point
with my family for senior year.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.159
<i>Okay, liv.</i>

08:14.161 --> 08:16.728
<i>It's killing me,</i>
<i>but i respect</i>

08:16.730 --> 08:18.930
<i>Your midwestern,</i>
<i>corn-fed values.</i>

08:18.932 --> 08:21.333
<i>Bye-bye from the bic.</i>

08:23.370 --> 08:25.036
You're gonna regret that.

08:25.038 --> 08:29.174
But not as much as you'll
regret cleaning out the crisper.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.275
(thudding)

08:30.277 --> 08:32.043
(sighs)

08:32.045 --> 08:33.245
(sloshing)

08:41.855 --> 08:43.788
Hey, sorry, excuse me.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.357
Hi. Hello.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.893
Welcome to hemispheric air.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.761
My name is vince.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.730
How can vince help you?

08:51.732 --> 08:54.933
Um, so, vince, i need to talk
to a passenger

08:54.935 --> 08:56.468
On the flight to australia.

08:56.470 --> 08:57.903
Of course you do.

08:57.905 --> 09:00.839
And vince would love
to make that happen.

09:02.109 --> 09:04.809
Great. Thank you
so much, vince.

09:04.811 --> 09:07.779
Unfortunately, that flight
left two hours ago.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.814
What?

09:10.918 --> 09:12.384
Two hours ago?

09:12.386 --> 09:14.286
Are you not understanding me?

09:14.288 --> 09:17.122
Sometimes vince
isn't very clear.

09:19.159 --> 09:22.327
Would it help
if film icon morgan freeman

09:22.329 --> 09:23.895
Explained it to you?

09:23.897 --> 09:24.763
(gasps)

09:26.133 --> 09:27.832
(imitates morgan freeman)
she was a girl...

09:29.336 --> 09:32.504
Racing cross country,
meeting the one man

09:32.506 --> 09:35.907
Who could provide her
with all the answers she needed.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.009
Unfortunately...

09:38.011 --> 09:40.979
She was as lost
as those little penguins

09:40.981 --> 09:43.014
Marching across the arctic...

09:43.016 --> 09:45.016
Or antarctic.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.786
I'm never really sure which.

09:49.523 --> 09:51.890
This is the greatest
airport ever!

09:51.892 --> 09:53.858
I'm sorry.

09:53.860 --> 09:55.760
I'm very confused.

09:55.762 --> 09:59.798
It is 9:25 and joey said
that flight 725

09:59.800 --> 10:02.467
Is leaving at 10:38, so...

10:04.371 --> 10:05.470
(computer beeps)

10:05.472 --> 10:11.376
Actually, flight 1038
left at 7:25.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.380
Would it cheer you up

10:15.382 --> 10:17.782
If funny-man
adam sandler stopped by?

10:17.784 --> 10:18.850
-(gasps)
-no.

10:20.887 --> 10:22.520
(imitates adam sandler)
how 'bout we put a little smile

10:22.522 --> 10:23.555
On that face, little lady?

10:23.557 --> 10:26.058
You know why?

10:26.059 --> 10:28.560
Because nobody wants to
see you cry at the airport!

10:28.562 --> 10:29.828
(laughs)

10:31.131 --> 10:32.998
Thank you, vince.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.899
You have been very helpful.

10:34.901 --> 10:37.002
Unlike some people.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.505
-So...
-Mm-hmm?

10:40.507 --> 10:44.109
There is no possibly way
that we could have ever

10:44.111 --> 10:46.177
Made it here
before diggie left?

10:46.179 --> 10:47.812
Uh... No.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.948
(laughs)

10:49.950 --> 10:51.349
My bad. Ha.

10:51.351 --> 10:52.550
Whew.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.285
Okay, maddie-- maddie!

10:57.357 --> 11:01.326
Maddie, i know you're hurting,
so let momma sing you something

11:01.328 --> 11:02.927
You used to love
when you were little.

11:04.931 --> 11:07.866
♪ this old man,
he played one ♪

11:07.868 --> 11:11.936
♪ he played a knick knack

11:11.938 --> 11:13.371

11:15.609 --> 11:18.943
Oh, maddie, you feeling
too sad to do

11:18.945 --> 11:20.879
The "knick knack paddywhacks"?

11:20.881 --> 11:23.114
You used to
love the "paddywhacks."

11:23.116 --> 11:26.251
Come on, maddie.

11:26.253 --> 11:29.020
Whack those paddies.

11:32.059 --> 11:34.492

11:44.971 --> 11:47.972

is gonna be okay.

11:49.643 --> 11:52.610
Whew. That was tense.

11:52.612 --> 11:55.246
I might just get away with this.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.549
Your performance
is a tour de force!

11:57.551 --> 11:59.517
The greatest show not on tv.

12:01.254 --> 12:04.989
But it needs
an unexpected plot twist.

12:04.991 --> 12:07.225
-(doorbell rings)
-called it!

12:12.299 --> 12:14.366
Who's at the door?

12:14.367 --> 12:16.434
-(running footsteps)
-wait for me, wait for me!

12:21.641 --> 12:23.041
(gasps)

12:23.043 --> 12:24.476
Liv:
Diggie?

12:24.478 --> 12:28.046
I thought you were
on your way to australia.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.547
Say it.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.950
Say it.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.618
I came back for maddie.

12:33.620 --> 12:34.986
Yeah, he did!

12:34.988 --> 12:36.054
Greatest show ever!

12:41.928 --> 12:44.095
Maddie will be thrilled
to see you.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.430
She's been a wreck all day.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.999
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.034
You cannot go in there.

12:50.036 --> 12:51.636
-Why not?
-Why?

12:51.638 --> 12:54.139
Yeah, liv, why?

12:57.444 --> 12:59.711
Because we...

12:59.713 --> 13:02.213
Have got a very fragile
little girl in there.

13:02.215 --> 13:08.353
I will take diggie to maddie
to facilitate the healing.

13:08.355 --> 13:11.956
Oh, you are a good sister.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.459
Oh, well, you have no idea.

13:17.631 --> 13:20.698
Well, today has been
emotionally exhausting.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.500
I'm gonna go take a nap.

13:22.502 --> 13:23.568
(fake yawns)

13:28.475 --> 13:29.507
Where's maddie?

13:29.509 --> 13:31.342
(imitates maddie)
oh, yay!

13:31.344 --> 13:34.312
Diggie, i'm so happy
to see you!

13:34.314 --> 13:35.380
I'm maddie!

13:35.382 --> 13:37.115
(as herself)
oh, mom and dad,

13:37.117 --> 13:37.982
Maddie and diggie are hugging!

13:37.984 --> 13:39.551
It's so sweet!

13:39.553 --> 13:41.252
Karen:
Oh!

13:42.389 --> 13:43.421
I'm here!

13:43.423 --> 13:45.123
I'm here. You can start.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.426
What is going on?

13:48.428 --> 13:50.995
Maddie is in los angeles
trying to catch you.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.531
What? Wait, why didn't
she come see me at school?

13:53.533 --> 13:55.316
I was waiting for her.

13:55.317 --> 13:57.100
She tried really hard,
but joey messed it up.

13:57.103 --> 13:58.436
Okay! See, so i knew it!

13:58.438 --> 14:00.171
-She wanted to see me.
-Yeah.

14:00.173 --> 14:03.241
And now you and maddie
are 2,000 miles apart,
you big dummy.

14:03.243 --> 14:04.609
Hey!

14:04.611 --> 14:07.245
Don't call that
sentimental fool a dummy.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.749
These crazy kids crossed
the country for each other.

14:11.751 --> 14:13.384
It's romantic.

14:18.792 --> 14:21.092
Maddie, maddie, maddie, maddie,
maddie, maddie, maddie, maddie,

14:21.094 --> 14:24.162
Maddie, maddie, maddie,
check it out.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.531
I've gone native angeleno.

14:28.401 --> 14:29.500
So what you've been up to?

14:29.502 --> 14:31.135
I bought a ticket to australia.

14:31.137 --> 14:32.437
You what?

14:32.439 --> 14:34.606
I know it sounds crazy,
but i have to see

14:34.608 --> 14:36.207
Diggie face-to-face
and talk this out.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.309
And you are not coming,
'cause i'm not gonna give

14:38.311 --> 14:39.677
You another chance
to mess this up.

14:39.679 --> 14:41.813
That's harsh, but wise.

14:41.815 --> 14:43.648
-Okay, can i see your phone?
I need to tell liv.
-Yeah.

14:44.784 --> 14:46.050
Thank you.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.586
-(phone rings)
-hello?

14:48.588 --> 14:50.555
Hey liv, um,
diggie's not in la,

14:50.557 --> 14:51.823
So i'm gonna go to australia.

14:51.825 --> 14:53.157
-Australia?
-(phones beep)

14:53.159 --> 14:54.759
-Liv?
-(phones beep)

14:54.761 --> 14:56.795
Maddie?

14:56.796 --> 14:58.830
-Ugh. I think their phone died.
-Okay. What did she say?

14:58.832 --> 15:00.331
She said she's going
to australia.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.200
-No!
-Yes!

15:02.202 --> 15:04.068
Could this day get any better?

15:04.070 --> 15:06.204
(doorbell)

15:06.206 --> 15:08.439
If that's the national guard
taking us to a safe zone

15:08.441 --> 15:10.408
To protect us
from the zombie apocalypse,

15:10.410 --> 15:11.776
I may just lose it!

15:13.680 --> 15:16.147
Karen:
Becky bicklehoff!
What a surprise.

15:16.149 --> 15:17.181
Becky?

15:17.183 --> 15:18.416
What is she doing here?

15:21.121 --> 15:22.520
I don't know
what anyone is doing.

15:25.258 --> 15:28.226
Becky, hi.

15:28.228 --> 15:31.129
What are you doing here
in stevens point

15:31.131 --> 15:33.197
And how did you
get here so fast?

15:33.199 --> 15:35.566
My boyfriend has access
to a navy jet.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.702
But forget about that.

15:37.704 --> 15:41.572
Your awesome manager convinced
the producers of <i> voltage</i>

15:41.574 --> 15:45.243
To shoot the show in wisconsin!

15:45.245 --> 15:46.644
-Really?
-Yes.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.246
They want me that badly?

15:49.649 --> 15:51.282
What'd i miss?
What'd i miss?

15:51.284 --> 15:54.252
Your sister is going
to sign this contract

15:54.254 --> 15:56.454
And hollywood is coming
to stevens point.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.556
This is so exciting!
We have to tell maddie!

15:58.558 --> 15:59.657
Oh, no! No, mom!

15:59.659 --> 16:00.725
No.

16:02.896 --> 16:04.529
Where's maddie?

16:04.531 --> 16:05.830
Um...

16:07.367 --> 16:09.667
(imitates maddie)
i'm in the pantry, mom!

16:12.706 --> 16:14.505
(imitates maddie)
bam! What?

16:17.210 --> 16:18.743
Liv does it better than i do.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.181
Liv.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.315
Where.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.550
Is.

16:25.552 --> 16:26.751
Maddie?

16:26.753 --> 16:28.786
Now!

16:30.857 --> 16:32.390
Maddie.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.826
Is sort of.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.229
On her way.

16:38.231 --> 16:41.466
To australia.

16:43.636 --> 16:44.936
Both:
What?

16:44.938 --> 16:47.705
Hey, um, can we hit pause?

16:47.707 --> 16:49.607
This time, i really do
have to run to the bathroom

16:49.609 --> 16:51.242
And i don't want
to miss a second of this.

16:57.283 --> 16:58.416
There are no flights.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.251
I can't get to la till tomorrow.

17:00.253 --> 17:02.253
Well, i'm on hold
with the airline,

17:02.255 --> 17:04.655
But we are gonna
find maddie and make sure

17:04.657 --> 17:06.190
That she does not
leave the country.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.359
And you, young lady,

17:08.361 --> 17:10.261
You are grounded for ten years.

17:10.263 --> 17:12.663
I'm really sorry that i lied

17:12.665 --> 17:14.298
And pretended
to be maddie all day.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.600
(gasps)

17:15.602 --> 17:17.468
Well, this is just
hitting me now.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.204
You faked the "paddywhacks."

17:22.208 --> 17:23.875
I did.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.643
I'm a big fat fakey-whack.

17:25.645 --> 17:26.878
Oh...

17:29.282 --> 17:30.581
So...

17:30.583 --> 17:33.384
Good time to discuss
the amazing deal

17:33.386 --> 17:34.986
That bic got for you!

17:34.988 --> 17:38.322
You know, honestly,
i'm really flattered,

17:38.324 --> 17:41.759
But i think it would
be very hard to do a tv show

17:41.761 --> 17:43.861
When i'm gonna
be grounded for ten years.

17:43.863 --> 17:45.396
Parker:
No!

17:45.398 --> 17:46.330
You have to let her do it!

17:46.332 --> 17:48.366
She was born to act.

17:48.368 --> 17:49.767
Did you see
what she pulled off today?

17:49.769 --> 17:52.970
It was funny, it was sad,
it was dramatic.

17:52.972 --> 17:55.239
I binge-watched the entire day!

17:56.876 --> 18:00.378
Oh, liv, honey, is something
that you really want to do?

18:02.549 --> 18:05.583
It has been really exciting
to be acting again.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.452
Pete:
Liv...

18:07.454 --> 18:09.687
(clears throat)

18:09.689 --> 18:13.391
You are still in huge trouble...

18:13.393 --> 18:14.926
But we're on board.

18:17.864 --> 18:20.898
Let's do a tv show
in stevens point!

18:20.900 --> 18:22.433
Becky:
Let's sign this contract

18:22.435 --> 18:24.702
And make it happen!

18:24.704 --> 18:27.438
-I'll get this back to la.
-Okay.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.573
Call you when i land, kid.

18:28.575 --> 18:29.874
Okay. Bye!

18:29.876 --> 18:31.509
Oh, becky!

18:31.511 --> 18:32.910
I have one more
favor to ask you.

18:45.859 --> 18:48.292
Is this crazy for me to go
running after diggie

18:48.294 --> 18:49.360
To australia like this?

18:49.362 --> 18:52.330
That's a tough one, mads.

18:52.332 --> 18:57.301
But if the city of angels has
taught me anything about life...

18:59.806 --> 19:02.874
It's that when the universe
wants you to move on, maddie,

19:02.876 --> 19:04.742
It's gonna make you move on.

19:07.347 --> 19:08.379
Yeah.

19:10.350 --> 19:11.816
I guess i just feel like...

19:11.818 --> 19:14.585
If it's this much work
to get him to stay, then...

19:16.422 --> 19:17.855
Maybe he's meant to go.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.592
That can't be easy to say.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.328
Yeah.

19:26.766 --> 19:30.501
I still just really wish that
i had the chance to say goodbye.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.341
Yo! Is that robert downey jr.?

19:37.343 --> 19:39.010
Rdj! Rdj!

19:40.513 --> 19:42.346
Thanks for the support!

19:48.955 --> 19:50.054
Maddie?

19:51.357 --> 19:52.390
Diggie?

19:52.392 --> 19:53.758
Hi!

19:53.760 --> 19:57.028
-Hi!
-Hi!

19:57.030 --> 19:59.664
All right, i got you here.
Good luck.

19:59.666 --> 20:02.900
Rdj! It's becky b!

20:04.404 --> 20:05.803
Hi.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.105
Maddie, you flew
all the way to la for me?

20:08.107 --> 20:09.707
Yeah. Of course!

20:09.709 --> 20:11.909
I mean, i had to see
you before you left.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.511
But why are you here?

20:13.513 --> 20:16.514
I thought you were way
on your way to australia.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.149
I had to see you.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.118
Maddie, listen...

20:21.120 --> 20:22.453
I won't go.

20:22.455 --> 20:23.821
I will stay for you.

20:25.425 --> 20:26.958
Yeah, i know you would.

20:28.561 --> 20:31.495
But i really do think
that you should go to australia.

20:33.166 --> 20:35.700
'cause i mean,
it's your dream and...

20:35.702 --> 20:38.402
I don't want to be the one
that keeps you from that.

20:40.974 --> 20:42.406
What about us?

20:44.978 --> 20:46.510
I think...

20:46.512 --> 20:49.547
We're saying goodbye for now.

20:49.549 --> 20:50.414
For now.

20:50.416 --> 20:51.616
(laughs nervously)

20:51.618 --> 20:52.850
You know?

20:54.554 --> 20:57.121
But i mean,
we're still such good friends.

21:02.161 --> 21:04.428

21:04.430 --> 21:07.098
If we're meant
to be more than that...

21:07.100 --> 21:09.900
The universe is gonna
let us know that.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.604
You're right.

23:48.261 --> 23:51.695
I am offended,
