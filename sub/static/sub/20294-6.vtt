00:38.100 --> 00:40.033
IN A COURT OF LAW.

00:41.633 --> 00:44.100
-INITIALLY WHEN I FIRST
CAME OUT TO PATROL,

00:44.200 --> 00:45.800
IT SEEMED LIKE
EVERY TIME I WOULD TURN

00:45.900 --> 00:48.567
DOWN A STREET OUT HERE,
MY TRAINING OFFICERS
WOULD BE LIKE,

00:48.667 --> 00:50.700
"IS THERE A STREET
YOU DON'T KNOW SOMEBODY ON?"

00:50.800 --> 00:52.100
AND I WAS LIKE,
"WELL, IT'S GONNA BE

00:52.200 --> 00:54.267
KIND OF HARD SINCE
I GREW UP OUT HERE."

00:54.367 --> 00:56.033
IT'S INTERESTING
'CAUSE I KNOW ALL THE--

02:29.067 --> 02:33.367

SOUTHEAST CORNER.

02:36.733 --> 02:38.800
-HE WENT INSIDE THIS HOUSE!

02:39.967 --> 02:41.767
IT LOOKS LIKE
THE SUSPECT WENT

02:41.867 --> 02:43.300
INTO THE BACK DOOR
OF THIS HOUSE.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.100
WHEN WE CAME
AROUND THE CORNER,

02:45.200 --> 02:46.600
I HEARD THE DOOR HIT.

02:46.700 --> 02:50.067
HE WAS A HISPANIC DUDE
PROBABLY AROUND 6' 2"

02:50.167 --> 02:51.867
WEARING A GREY BASEBALL CAP.

02:51.967 --> 02:53.767
WE'RE GONNA
SET UP A PERIMETER,

02:53.867 --> 02:56.700
GONNA HAVE K9 COME UP.
THEY'RE DOIN' A CALL OUT
OF THIS HOUSE.

02:56.800 --> 02:59.067
MAKING SURE THAT--
THEN SEARCH THE INTERIOR
OF THE HOUSE

02:59.133 --> 03:00.567
TO MAKE SURE
HE'S NOT INSIDE.

03:01.933 --> 03:03.067
I THINK HE WENT
THROUGH THE WINDOWS.

03:03.133 --> 03:04.600
SEE HOW THE DRAPE
IS TORN DOWN?

03:04.700 --> 03:06.200
HE'S IN THERE.

04:14.100 --> 04:15.733
I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT THAT'S THE GUY.

04:15.833 --> 04:18.400
IT'S LIKE, HE HAS
BRUISING AND SCRATCHING
ALL OVER HIS FACE.

04:18.500 --> 04:19.633
SAID HE GOT INTO
A FIGHT EARLIER.

04:19.733 --> 04:21.200
I THINK IT'S FROM HIM
JUMPING OVER THE FENCE.

04:21.300 --> 04:22.333
HIS PULSE IS RACIN'.

04:22.433 --> 04:24.200
HE DON'T HAVE
ON ANY CLOTHES.

04:27.233 --> 04:28.167
-HIS DRINK IS RIGHT HERE.

04:28.267 --> 04:30.067

HE WAS DRINKING?

04:30.133 --> 04:32.467

04:32.567 --> 04:34.467
-I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE
ANY CONFIRMED M.O.

04:34.567 --> 04:37.167

IN IT, IT'S GOT HIS CLOTHING.

04:37.267 --> 04:38.667
WHERE'S-- WHERE'D YOU SAY
THAT WALLET WAS AT?

04:38.767 --> 04:40.233

04:40.333 --> 04:41.533
OKAY. SHOES.

04:41.633 --> 04:43.067

-IS THAT IT?

04:43.133 --> 04:44.467
-YUP, THERE'S
HIS SHOES RIGHT THERE.

04:44.567 --> 04:45.500

04:45.600 --> 04:47.267
WEARING GREY SHOES
JUST LIKE THAT.

04:47.367 --> 04:49.267
AND OBVIOUSLY, YOU SEE
HOW FAST HE SHOWERED.

04:49.367 --> 04:51.467
HE WAS PROBABLY TRYING TO RINSE
THE SWEAT ALL OFF OF HIM.

04:51.567 --> 04:52.867
SO WE'LL-- WE'LL LEAVE THAT.

04:52.967 --> 04:54.533
WE'LL HAVE CSI
PHOTOGRAPH THAT ALSO.

04:54.633 --> 04:56.800

05:04.533 --> 05:06.067
-I'M BEING DETAINED?
-YEAH. YOU'RE DETAINED.

05:06.167 --> 05:08.100
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
SITTING IN THE CAR--
IT'S CALLED DETENTION.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.233
-I THOUGHT IT WAS
ONLY BECAUSE THERE WAS
SOMEBODY IN THE HOUSE.

05:10.333 --> 05:11.767
-NO. THIS RIGHT NOW
IS A DETENTION.

05:11.867 --> 05:13.667
-I'M BEING DETAINED, RIGHT?

PROBABLY ABOUT
75 YARDS, 80 YARDS,

05:18.500 --> 05:20.067
AND JUST CAME
TO A STOP HERE.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.300
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THE KEY
THAT CAME OUT OF THE IGNITION.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.233
YOU CAN SEE IT'S SHAVED
NICE AND SMOOTH AND FLAT.

05:25.333 --> 05:27.533
OLDER TOYOTAS-- THIS THING
WILL PROBABLY START,

05:27.633 --> 05:29.267
YOU KNOW,
FOUR OUT OF TEN OF THEM.

05:29.367 --> 05:31.633
AND THERE'S THE SAME CAN

05:31.733 --> 05:32.967
IN THE SUSPECT'S BEDROOM.

05:33.067 --> 05:34.333

-...SITTING IN THE BATHROOM
RIGHT NEXT TO HIS I.D.

05:40.833 --> 05:42.800
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A TRAIL
OF WATER THROUGH THE HOUSE

05:42.900 --> 05:44.533
WHERE HE RAN
IN THE SHOWER REAL QUICK.

05:44.633 --> 05:46.133
HE'S PROBABLY GOT
SOME SCRATCHES OR SOMETHING

05:46.233 --> 05:47.800
ON HIM FROM GOING
OVER THE FENCE.
-HE HAS A BUNCH.

05:47.900 --> 05:49.167
-SO... ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

05:49.267 --> 05:51.900

AND FACE THAT WAY.

05:55.533 --> 05:57.867

06:08.800 --> 06:10.333
-I DID WHAT AGAIN?

06:10.433 --> 06:12.833
WHAT'S THAT I DID?

06:12.933 --> 06:15.333
-YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR
POSSESSION OF A STOLEN VEHICLE,

06:15.433 --> 06:18.667
-I DIDN'T DO THAT.

08:15.233 --> 08:17.833
-(police radio chatter)
-OH MY GOD.

08:17.933 --> 08:19.100
-BRING YOUR OTHER
ARM STRAIGHT BACK.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.867
BRING IT BACK.
BRING IT HERE.

08:20.967 --> 08:22.400
-I CAN'T. I CAN'T.
-THERE YOU GO.

08:22.500 --> 08:23.500
-OH GOD.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.867
I CANNOT WALK,
SO DON'T ASK ME TO.

08:25.967 --> 08:28.100
-OKAY.
-DO NOT ASK ME TO.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.100
-ALL RIGHT. ANYTHING ON YOU
POKE, STICK, OR HURT ME?

08:30.200 --> 08:31.833
-HELL...
-WHAT?

08:31.933 --> 08:34.567
-HELL-- I CAN'T TALK.
HELL NO.
-OKAY. HELL NO.

08:34.667 --> 08:36.367
HEY, DO YOU NEED
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TO
CHECK YOU OUT?

08:36.467 --> 08:37.533
-I NEED AN AMBULANCE.
-OKAY.

08:37.633 --> 08:38.833
DO ME A FAVOR.
JUST ROLL TO YOUR SIDE.

08:38.933 --> 08:40.433
-I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN.
-SIT UP.

08:40.533 --> 08:42.433
ALL THE WAY UP.
-(screaming)

08:42.533 --> 08:44.067
-YOU JUST WANNA LAY DOWN?
-YEAH.

08:44.100 --> 08:45.467
JUST LEAVE ME THERE.
-OKAY.

08:45.567 --> 08:46.933
JUST RELAX. STAY
RIGHT THERE, OKAY?

08:47.067 --> 08:48.233
HEY WILLIAM,
WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT?

08:48.333 --> 08:49.767
-SHE CALLED ME OVER.

08:49.867 --> 08:52.233
"YOU CAN GO TO THE HOUSE."
FIND THE FLOWERS,

08:52.333 --> 08:54.800
FIND THE MOTHER'S DAY CARD,
EVERYTHING SHE (bleep)

08:54.900 --> 08:56.800
WHEN I BROUGHT IT TO THE DOOR,
SHE BROKE MY (bleep) FOOT.

08:56.900 --> 08:58.400
TOOK IT AND TOOK MY KEYS.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.567
-OKAY, SO YOU WERE
OVER THERE TRYING TO RECONCILE,

09:00.667 --> 09:02.200
AND GIVE HER STUFF
FOR MOTHER'S DAY?
-RECONCILE!

09:02.300 --> 09:04.367
AND (bleep).
SHE-- SHE SHUT ME OUT.

09:04.467 --> 09:06.500
AND NOW I CAN'T WALK.
-OKAY.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.967
-MY FOOT IS BROKEN.
-OKAY. WHICH FOOT?

09:09.067 --> 09:10.833
-THIS ONE RIGHT...
(indistinct)

09:10.933 --> 09:13.567
-THE LEFT ONE?
-YES. I DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW.

09:13.667 --> 09:15.800
-ALL RIGHT.
-AND I'VE BEEN
SCREAMING FOR HELP.

09:15.900 --> 09:18.533
EVER SINCE THE MIDDLE
OF THE (bleep) STREET.

09:18.633 --> 09:20.200
AND NOBODY
WILL HELP ME.

09:20.300 --> 09:22.900
-OKAY.
-CAN YOU SEE
THE TOP OF MY FOOT?

09:23.067 --> 09:25.433
-YEAH, IT DOESN'T
LOOK NORMAL.
-EXACTLY.

09:25.533 --> 09:27.067
-SO HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

09:27.100 --> 09:29.400
-SHE OPENED THE BACK DOOR
AND SLAMMED SOMETHING
ON THE TOP OF MY FOOT.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.900
-SHE KNEW THAT
YOU WERE COMING OVER?
-YEAH.

09:32.067 --> 09:34.100
YOU CAN (bleep)
CHECK THE (bleep)

09:34.200 --> 09:35.767
TEXT MESSAGES
ON MY PHONE.

09:35.867 --> 09:38.300
-SO DID SHE INVITE YOU OVER
OR DID YOU JUST COME OVER?
-YES, SHE DID.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.933
SHE JUST TOLD ME,
"COME OVER HERE.
I NEED MONEY FOR GAS."

09:41.067 --> 09:42.833
-SO SHE INVITED YOU OVER
TO GET MONEY FOR GAS?

09:42.933 --> 09:44.667
AND SO THEN
YOU THOUGHT YOU'D--

09:44.767 --> 09:47.067
-BECAUSE I WAS SUPPOSED
TO MEET HER AT THE SPOT.

09:47.100 --> 09:49.400
-WHAT'S THE SPOT?
-SADDLEBACK MOUNTAIN.

09:49.500 --> 09:51.067
-SO DID YOU KNOW
THAT-- BUT...

09:51.167 --> 09:52.667
THE ORDER OF PROTECTION
THAT'S IN PLACE...

09:52.767 --> 09:54.833
-SHE TOLD ME IT WASN'T.
-SHE TOLD YOU IT WASN'T?

09:54.933 --> 09:56.967
-WHEN I GOT OUT
FROM THE LAST TIME,

09:57.067 --> 09:59.067
WHEN THEY GAVE
ME MY BOND BACK,

09:59.167 --> 10:00.767
-EMT:
WILLIAM, WHAT'S
GOING ON TONIGHT?

10:00.867 --> 10:03.400
-I GOT A BIPOLAR EXPRESS.
SHE BROKE MY FOOT.

10:03.500 --> 10:06.167
-OKAY.
HAVE YOU WALKED ON IT SINCE?

10:06.267 --> 10:08.300
-DUDE, I CRAWLED
HALFWAY HERE.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.800
-ANY DRUGS,
ALCOHOL TONIGHT?

10:09.900 --> 10:11.733
-HELL YEAH!
HOW DO YOU THINK
I GOT THIS FAR?

10:11.833 --> 10:13.600
I GOT AN ICE CHEST FULL
OF BEER IN THE BACK OF MY CAR.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.433
AND NO ONE HELPED ME,
SO IT'S HARD TO DRINK THE BEERS.

10:15.533 --> 10:17.400
YOU CAN FIND BEERS
UP AND DOWN THIS ROAD.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.567
-OKAY. HOW MUCH BEER
HAVE YOU HAD TONIGHT?

10:19.667 --> 10:21.200
-THREE.
-THREE?

10:21.300 --> 10:23.433
-Officer: ALL RIGHT,
HE'S GOING TO BE TRANSPORTED
TO WEST VALLEY BUCKEYE.

10:23.533 --> 10:25.667
IT'S NON-LIFE THREATENING.
-LET'S GO TALK TO HER.

10:25.767 --> 10:27.667
-TERRI?
-YEAH.

10:27.767 --> 10:29.967
(knocks on door)

10:31.000 --> 10:32.700
HEY, TERRI.
-HI.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.833
-HI. OKAY...
-HOW ARE YOU?

10:34.933 --> 10:36.100
-GOOD.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.933
-TODAY HE CAME OVER
AND KIND OF FELL

10:38.033 --> 10:41.667
THROUGH THE BACK DOOR
AND SAID HE BROKE HIS FOOT...

10:41.767 --> 10:44.233
-SO DID HE FALL THROUGH?
EXPLAIN TO ME EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED.

10:44.333 --> 10:46.300
HOW, WHY DID HE COME OVER HERE
OR ANYTHING TO THAT EFFECT?

10:46.400 --> 10:48.467
DID YOU INVITE HIM OVER HERE?
-HE'S... NO.

10:48.567 --> 10:49.700
-OKAY.
-NO.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.800
HE'S TRYING TO
MAKE UP WITH ME

10:51.900 --> 10:54.000
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING
THROUGH A DIVORCE RIGHT NOW.

10:54.100 --> 10:57.133
-OKAY.
-BUT I'M NOT UP FOR IT.

10:57.233 --> 10:58.867
-OKAY, SO HE JUST
RANDOMLY SHOWED UP?

10:58.967 --> 11:01.833
WAS HE TEXTING YOU,
CALLING YOU, OR ANYTHING
LIKE THAT BEFORE?

11:01.933 --> 11:04.433
-HE'S BEEN TEXTING
ME ALL ALONG.

11:04.533 --> 11:06.233
-OKAY. DO YOU HAVE
HIS PHONE HERE STILL?

11:06.333 --> 11:09.533
-I DO. I HAVE THIS STUFF
THAT HE BROUGHT OVER.

11:09.633 --> 11:11.233
-AND DO YOU HAVE
YOUR PHONE, TOO?

11:11.333 --> 11:14.133
CAN I COME IN OR?
-YES.

11:14.233 --> 11:15.633
-DO YOU MIND SHOWING
ME THE TEXT MESSAGES

11:15.733 --> 11:17.600
THAT WE WAS SENDING BEFORE?
-SURE.

11:17.700 --> 11:20.067
-Boy: HI!
-HI! HOW YOU DOING?

11:20.167 --> 11:22.067
IS THAT HIS STUFF
THAT HE BROUGHT OVER?
-YES.

11:22.100 --> 11:23.600
-OKAY.
-Boy: LOOK AT MY NEW SHIRT!

11:23.700 --> 11:25.133
-THAT'S A VERY COOL SHIRT.

11:25.233 --> 11:26.633
I LIKE IT!
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

11:26.733 --> 11:28.500
-WANNA SIT DOWN?

11:28.600 --> 11:30.433
-OH, I'M OKAY
FOR RIGHT NOW.

11:30.533 --> 11:32.100
DO YOU HAVE THE COPY
FOR THE ORDER OF PROTECTION?

11:32.200 --> 11:35.833
-I DON'T, IT-- IT'S...
IN THE MESS SOMEWHERE
IN THE BOXES.

11:35.933 --> 11:37.633
-WHAT'S THIS SPOT AT 9:00?

11:37.733 --> 11:39.933
-WE HAD THIS SPOT
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED DATING

11:40.067 --> 11:41.900
THAT WE USE TO GO
HANG OUT AT.

11:42.067 --> 11:43.267
-MM-HMM.

11:43.367 --> 11:44.667
-(screaming)
-SO WHAT--

11:44.767 --> 11:46.133
WHAT WAS THE POINT
OF YOU TRYING TO GO

11:46.233 --> 11:48.367
OVER THERE WITH HIM?
AT YOUR GUYS' SPOT?

11:48.467 --> 11:50.500
-I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS MARRIED TO HIM--

11:50.600 --> 11:51.933
I'VE BEEN MARRIED
TO HIM FOR A WHILE,

11:52.067 --> 11:53.400
WE'VE GOT A KID
TOGETHER, YOU KNOW?

11:53.500 --> 11:56.267
I GUESS I KIND OF WANTED
TO HEAR HIM OUT AND...

11:56.367 --> 11:58.300
-IT SEEMS PRETTY MUCH
YOU'RE NOT NECESSARILY

11:58.400 --> 11:59.600
GIVING UP ON
YOUR GUYS' RELATIONSHIP

11:59.700 --> 12:01.767
AND THERE'S THE POSSIBILITY--
-I HAVE NOW. NO.

12:01.867 --> 12:05.067
-YOU HAVE NOW, AFTER TONIGHT.
BUT BEFORE THIS...

12:05.167 --> 12:06.400
-I SHOULD HAVE.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.933
EVERYBODY'S TOLD ME
I'M CRAZY FOR NOT.

12:09.067 --> 12:11.600
-SO, WHAT HAPPENED
TO HIS FOOT?

12:11.700 --> 12:12.733
HAVE YOU SEEN HIS FOOT?

12:12.833 --> 12:13.933
-I HAVEN'T SEEN HIS FOOT.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.067
MY MOM AND DAD HAVE
A FIRE PIT BACK HERE.

12:16.133 --> 12:18.167
HE SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT FIRE.

12:18.267 --> 12:20.600
-OKAY. 'CAUSE HE'S GOT
A PRETTY BIG CONTUSION

12:20.700 --> 12:22.533
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
ON THE TOP OF HIS FOOT,

12:22.633 --> 12:24.133
WHICH I'M GUESSING...

12:24.233 --> 12:26.233
I MEAN, I CAN SPECULATE
AND SAY THAT HE--

12:26.333 --> 12:28.700
HE KICKED THE FIRE PIT OVER
ON IT 'CAUSE IT'S RIGHT
ON THE TOP

12:28.800 --> 12:31.533
OF HIS FOOT HERE.
-I WOULD SAY YEAH. (laughs)

12:31.633 --> 12:34.400
-ALL RIGHT.
-WHAT'S THE SITUATION
WITH HIM AS FAR AS CUSTODY?

12:34.500 --> 12:36.233
HAS ANY OF THAT
BEEN RULED YET?
-THERE IS NONE YET.

12:36.333 --> 12:37.733
NO, NOT YET.
-SO YOU GUYS ARE STILL...

12:37.833 --> 12:40.567
-I'VE BEEN LETTING HIM,
YOU KNOW, SEE HIM

12:40.667 --> 12:42.167
KIND OF ON
A SUPERVISED SITUATION.

12:42.267 --> 12:44.067
BUT HE HAD HIM LAST WEEKEND.

12:44.167 --> 12:45.900
-HOW IS THAT WORKING WITH
THE ORDER OF PROTECTION THEN?

12:46.067 --> 12:50.367
IF YOU'RE ENGAGING,
YOU'RE TECHNICALLY
VIOLATING IT JUST AS MUCH, SO...

12:50.467 --> 12:52.933
-THE LEGAL ADVOCATE
TOLD ME NOT TO LET HIM

12:53.067 --> 12:57.133
SEE HIM AT ALL,
WHICH KIND OF MADE
ME FEEL ROTTEN.

12:57.233 --> 12:58.867
-I CAN-- I CAN SEE
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM.

12:58.967 --> 13:01.100
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
THERE'S A PURPOSE

13:01.200 --> 13:04.233
TO HAVING THAT
ORDER OF PROTECTION
AND EVERYTHING IN PLACE.

13:04.333 --> 13:05.967
IF YOU STILL WANT,
YOU KNOW, YOUR SON

13:06.067 --> 13:07.600
TO BE ABLE TO SEE
HIS FATHER, THAT'S FINE.

13:07.700 --> 13:08.833
BUT GO THROUGH
A THIRD PARTY.

13:08.933 --> 13:10.700
TALK TO HIS SISTER,
AND HAVE YOUR SISTER

13:10.800 --> 13:13.400
COMMUNICATE BETWEEN
AS A MEDIATOR AND SUCH.
-OKAY.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.067
-OKAY? THANK YOU, TERRI.

13:15.100 --> 13:17.133
-WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
-WHERE AM I GOING?

13:17.233 --> 13:20.333
-YEAH.
-SO I... I GOT MORE PEOPLE
I GOTTA GO SEE.

13:21.567 --> 13:23.600
ALL RIGHT?
-WHAT?

13:23.700 --> 13:25.467
(Terri laughs)

13:27.767 --> 13:30.233
-SHORTLY AFTER 9/11
I JOINED THE MILITARY.

13:30.333 --> 13:31.967
DID SIX YEARS
IN THE MILITARY.

13:32.067 --> 13:33.833
DID A TOUR IN IRAQ,
A TOUR OVERSEAS,

13:33.933 --> 13:36.300
GOT OUT AND JOINED
THE BEAUMONT POLICE DEPARTMENT.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.600
I'VE BEEN HERE
ALMOST SEVEN YEARS NOW.

13:38.700 --> 13:40.867
GREAT PLACE TO WORK.
ENJOY WORKING HERE,

13:40.967 --> 13:43.200
AND I HOPE TO HAVE
A GOOD LONG CAREER HERE.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.300

GREEN CAR RIGHT HERE

13:45.400 --> 13:48.200

WALK TO THE BACK OF THE CAR.

15:37.833 --> 15:39.100
YOU MIND IF
I SEARCH YOUR POCKETS?

15:39.200 --> 15:40.267
-NO. IT'S COOL.

15:40.367 --> 15:41.633
-DO YOU HAVE
ANYTHING ILLEGAL ON YOU?

15:41.733 --> 15:42.733
-NO, SIR.

15:42.833 --> 15:45.100
-SO WHO DID YOU GO
UP THERE AND TALK TO?

15:45.200 --> 15:46.967
'CAUSE I SAW YOU
OUT OF THE CAR

15:47.067 --> 15:48.833
FOOLING WITH A BIKE
AND STUFF.
-YEAH.

15:48.933 --> 15:52.100
-WHO DID YOU TALK TO?
-BUDDY... (mumbling)

15:52.200 --> 15:54.067
-DID YOU BUY ANYTHING
WHILE YOU WERE THERE?
-NO, SIR.

15:54.167 --> 15:55.400
-HAVE YOU EVER
SMOKED CRACK BEFORE?

15:55.500 --> 15:56.967
-NO, SIR.

15:59.167 --> 16:00.667
-(police radio chatter)

16:00.767 --> 16:02.433
-HERE, GIVE ME--
GIVE ME THIS HAND.

16:04.067 --> 16:05.467
HANG ON.

16:05.567 --> 16:07.967
-(mumbling)
-GIVE ME YOUR OTHER HAND.
GIVE ME YOUR OTHER HAND.

16:11.933 --> 16:13.567
SO WHAT IS THIS THAT
I FOUND IN YOUR POCKET?

16:13.667 --> 16:15.433
-I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THIS IS.

16:15.533 --> 16:16.633
-YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THIS IS?

16:16.733 --> 16:18.533
IT LOOKS LIKE
CRACK COCAINE TO ME.

16:18.633 --> 16:19.700
IT WAS IN YOUR POCKET.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.200
AND YOU SAID I COULD
SEARCH YOUR POCKETS.

16:21.300 --> 16:22.967
-I-- I'M NOT THAT STUPID.

16:23.067 --> 16:24.567
-SO THEN HOW DID
THAT GET IN YOUR POCKET?

16:24.667 --> 16:26.467
-I HAVE NO IDEA.

16:26.567 --> 16:29.233
-ARE THOSE YOUR PANTS?
-YES, SIR.

16:29.333 --> 16:30.600
-HOW LONG HAVE
YOU HAD THEM ON?

16:30.700 --> 16:32.233
-WELL, I WORE THEM
TO WORK TODAY.

16:32.333 --> 16:34.300
-OKAY. HERE,
STAND RIGHT THERE.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.333
NO IDEA WHAT THAT IS?
-NO, SIR.

16:36.433 --> 16:37.833
-THERE'S ANOTHER LARGER
PIECE OF CRACK

16:37.933 --> 16:39.267
WHERE HE WAS SITTING
RIGHT THERE.

16:39.367 --> 16:41.333
THAT'S A GOOD LARGE CHUNK.

16:41.433 --> 16:43.900
YOU NORMALLY DON'T
FIND THEM IN THE...
THIS SIZE RIGHT HERE.

16:44.067 --> 16:46.333
HEY, CAN YOU STICK
HIM IN YOUR CAR?

16:46.433 --> 16:49.500
BRANDON, SO WHO DID
HE GO TALK TO UP THERE?

16:49.600 --> 16:51.900
I'M PRETTY SURE
YOU KNOW THAT
HE DEALS DRUGS.

16:52.067 --> 16:54.067
I KNOW WHAT HE DOES,
BUT I'M NOT THERE FOR THAT.

16:54.167 --> 16:55.467
-OKAY.

16:56.867 --> 17:00.133
-IT'S 10:40 AT NIGHT.
-RIGHT.

17:00.233 --> 17:02.400
-YOU GUYS DON'T LIVE THERE.
-RIGHT.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.567
-IT JUST LOOKS ODD
THAT YOU GUYS ARE THERE.

17:04.667 --> 17:06.233
-I UNDERSTAND
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM.
-OKAY.

17:06.333 --> 17:07.633
-I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO
TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

17:07.733 --> 17:10.067
I NOTICED WHEN WE PULLED IN,
HE ROLLED DOWN MY BACK WINDOW

17:10.133 --> 17:12.067
-YEAH?
-AND HE THREW HIS PIPE
OUT ON THE GROUND.

17:12.167 --> 17:13.500
-DID WHAT NOW?

17:13.600 --> 17:15.700
-HE ROLLED DOWN MY BACK WINDOW
WHEN WE PULLED IN HERE

17:15.800 --> 17:16.933
AND THREW HIS PIPE
OUT ON THE GROUND.

17:17.067 --> 17:18.700
-OVER HERE? ON THIS SIDE
OR ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE?

17:18.800 --> 17:21.633
-ON THIS SIDE.
-ON THIS SIDE HE...

17:21.733 --> 17:23.433
SO HOW DID HE ROLL
THE BACK WINDOW DOWN?

17:23.533 --> 17:24.833
-YOU CAN ROLL 'EM DOWN.

17:24.933 --> 17:26.867
-OH. OH, HE REACHED
OVER AND THEN ROLLED IT DOWN?

17:26.967 --> 17:28.767
AND THREW A PIPE
OUT ONTO THE GROUND HERE?

17:28.867 --> 17:30.167
OKAY.

17:30.267 --> 17:32.600
SO YOU GUYS PICKED
HIM UP ON COLLEGE STREET...

17:32.700 --> 17:34.500
-YEAH, 'CAUSE WE KNOW HIM.
WE WAS GIVING HIM A RIDE HOME.

17:34.600 --> 17:35.733
BUT HE WANTED
TO STOP BY THERE.

17:35.833 --> 17:37.633
-BUT YOU GUYS WERE JUST
DRIVING BY AND HE FLAGGED

17:37.733 --> 17:40.100
YOU DOWN AND SAID, "HEY!"
OR DID YOU GUYS CALL HIM?

17:40.200 --> 17:42.233
-NO, WE DIDN'T CALL HIM.
HE DON'T EVEN HAVE A PHONE.

17:42.333 --> 17:43.833
I DON'T EVEN HAVE MY--
MY PHONE IS UPDATING

17:43.933 --> 17:45.467
AT THE MOMENT
SO I CAN'T EVEN USE IT.

17:45.567 --> 17:46.733
-OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
LET ME GO UP HERE

17:46.833 --> 17:48.067
AND SEE IF I CAN
FIND THIS PIPE.

17:48.133 --> 17:49.900
THERE IT IS RIGHT THERE.

17:50.067 --> 17:52.067
ALL RIGHT THE--
THE FRONT PASSENGER HERE

17:52.133 --> 17:54.067
TOLD ME WHEN
THESE GUYS STOPPED

17:54.167 --> 17:56.233
THAT HE TOSSED
HIS CRACK PIPE OUT HERE.

17:56.333 --> 17:58.367
AND SURE ENOUGH,
THERE'S A CRACK PIPE
ON THE GROUND.

17:59.800 --> 18:00.800
ALL RIGHT JENNIFER,
COME HERE.

18:00.900 --> 18:03.167
OKAY, WHOSE IS THAT?
-GARY.

18:03.267 --> 18:04.733
-OKAY, HOW DID IT
GET OUT THERE?

18:04.833 --> 18:06.900
-HE HANDED IT TO BRANDON.

18:07.067 --> 18:09.867
AND BRANDON TRIED
TO HAND IT BACK TO HIM.

18:09.967 --> 18:12.167
AND THEN THAT'S WHEN
Y'ALL CAME UP TO THE CAR.

18:12.267 --> 18:15.067
-OKAY. SO HE--
THE OLD MAN IN THE BACK...

18:15.167 --> 18:16.600
-YES.
-...GAVE IT TO BRANDON.

18:16.700 --> 18:19.567
-YES. AND BRANDON SAID,
"NUH-UH," AND HE TRIED
TO HAND IT BACK.

18:19.667 --> 18:22.333
BUT BY THAT TIME,
Y'ALL WERE ALREADY
COMING UP TO THE CAR.

18:22.433 --> 18:23.667
-OKAY, SO HOW DID IT
END UP OUTSIDE?

18:23.767 --> 18:26.067
-I GUESS IT...
-HE DIDN'T GET IT BACK
TO THE OLD MAN

18:26.100 --> 18:27.733
AND BRANDON THREW
IT OUT THERE?
-NO.

18:27.833 --> 18:29.833
WHEN BRANDON TRIED
TO HAND IT BACK TO HIM,

18:29.933 --> 18:31.767
Y'ALL WERE COMING
UP TO THE CAR.

18:31.867 --> 18:34.333
SO I GUESS BRANDON...
-I-- HE HAD TO HAVE
THROWN IT OUT THERE

18:34.433 --> 18:35.867
BECAUSE IF HE'S SITTING
RIGHT HERE...
-YEAH...

18:35.967 --> 18:38.733
BUT IT WAS HIS,
THE DUDE IN THE BACKSEAT.

18:38.833 --> 18:41.533
-ALL RIGHT.
HANG OUT HERE.

18:41.633 --> 18:44.600
BRANDON, YOUR VERSION
AND YOUR WIFE'S VERSION
ARE DIFFERENT.

18:44.700 --> 18:46.733
MY GUESS IS YOU GUYS WANTED
TO SMOKE SOME DRUGS,

18:46.833 --> 18:48.567
PICKED UP GARY,
HE WENT OVER THERE,

18:48.667 --> 18:50.167
HE BOUGHT IT FOR YOU,
AND YOU GUYS WERE GONNA

18:50.267 --> 18:52.600
GO SMOKE IT SOMEWHERE.
-THAT WAS NOT--
THAT WAS NOT OURS.

18:52.700 --> 18:55.500
-OKAY. JUST SAYING
THERE WAS QUITE A BIT.
-HE GOT IT HIMSELF.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.100
-I... I UNDERSTAND.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.300
THE DRUGS ARE GARY'S,
HE'S GOING TO JAIL FOR 'EM.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.400
AND THE PARAPHERNALIA IS YOURS.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.767
I UNDERSTAND THAT, OKAY?
I'M JUST SAYING...

19:03.867 --> 19:05.233
-THE PARAPHERNALIA
IS NOT MINE, SIR.

19:05.333 --> 19:07.867
-WHAT I'M THINKING IS
YOU GUYS DECIDED
TO GO OVER HERE,

19:07.967 --> 19:09.633
SMOKE IT TOGETHER.
THAT'S MY THEORY.

19:09.733 --> 19:10.767
BUT HE'S GOT
DRUGS ON HIM.

19:10.867 --> 19:11.967
HE'S GOING TO JAIL TONIGHT.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.400
YOU COULD BE EASILY
SITTING IN THERE WITH HIM

19:13.500 --> 19:15.367
IF I SEE IT AGAIN, ALL RIGHT?
STAY RIGHT THERE, OKAY?

19:15.467 --> 19:16.667
ALL RIGHT, SO LOOK, GARY.

19:16.767 --> 19:18.600
WAS IT YOUR IDEA TO GO
OVER THERE AND BUY THE DRUGS?

19:18.700 --> 19:20.233
-YEAH. I THINK SO.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.667
PRETTY SURE THE PARAPHERNALIA
WAS BRANDON'S, OKAY?

19:22.767 --> 19:24.400
BUT YOU KNEW
THE PLACE TO GO TO,

19:24.500 --> 19:26.400
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT
MADE THE DEAL OVER THERE,

19:26.500 --> 19:27.567
AND I SAW YOU
IN THE YARD.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.300
SO, SORRY,
YOU'RE GONNA
BE GOING TO JAIL

19:29.400 --> 19:31.067
FOR POSSESSION
WITH CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE, OKAY?

19:33.933 --> 19:35.333
ALL RIGHT SO LOOK,
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU

19:35.433 --> 19:36.500
THE SAME THING
THAT I TOLD HIM.

19:36.600 --> 19:39.100
PICKING UP PEOPLE
THAT YOU KNOW ARE DRUG USERS

19:39.200 --> 19:41.700
AND GOING TO AREAS
THAT YOU KNOW SELL DRUGS

19:41.800 --> 19:43.333
IS GONNA GET
YOURSELF IN A JAM.

19:43.433 --> 19:44.700
YOU NEED TO MAKE
SOME BETTER LIFE CHOICES

19:44.800 --> 19:46.833
UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEND
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE LOCKED UP.

19:46.933 --> 19:48.533
-Brandon: THANK YOU, SIR.
-ALL RIGHT.

19:48.633 --> 19:49.667
-Police radio:
132 AND BUSH.

19:49.767 --> 19:51.333
I'VE GOT HIM AT GUNPOINT.

19:51.433 --> 19:53.100
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, GUNPOINT, 132 AND BUSH.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.133
COVER IS CODE THREE.

19:54.233 --> 19:57.200
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:03.733 --> 20:05.667
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, STILL SEND A CODE THREE.

20:05.767 --> 20:06.767
-(theme music playing)
