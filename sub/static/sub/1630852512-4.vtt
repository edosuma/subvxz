<i> [bot] robots activate.</i>

00:20.154 --> 00:23.155
<i> Welcome to battlebots,</i>
<i> the only sport where kill saws</i>

00:23.157 --> 00:25.224
and pulverizers
are totally legal.

00:25.226 --> 00:28.827
Hi, everybody. I'm chris rose,
and I'm joined by a ufc legend

00:28.829 --> 00:32.297
and the best damn
robot combat analyst
in the entire world,

00:32.299 --> 00:34.233
say hello to kenny florian.

00:37.938 --> 00:39.505
Thanks, chris.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.708
By the way, I'm pretty sure
those weapons were actually
legal in rollerball.

00:42.710 --> 00:46.345
Well, kenny, that was a movie.
I meant real life sports.

00:46.347 --> 00:50.115
Well, they definitely
had kill saws in the xfl.

00:50.117 --> 00:52.184
I think you might be
misremembering that.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.453
Was it rock n' jock
basketball?

00:54.455 --> 00:56.989
I know I saw kill
saw somewhere.

00:56.991 --> 00:57.856
It'll come to me.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.658
Anyway, while you search
for that answer,

00:59.660 --> 01:01.827
let's talk about some bots
that'll be searching

01:01.829 --> 01:05.164
for something else tonight,
that is a perfect start
to their season.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.699
Five of tonight's
seven matchups

01:07.701 --> 01:12.304
feature teams looking
to jump out to clean
2-0 records, kenny.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.339
[kenny] that's right.
We'll see the punching disc

01:14.341 --> 01:17.309
of tantrum as new captains
alex grant

01:17.311 --> 01:19.845
and ginger schmidt
look to stay undefeated

01:19.847 --> 01:21.947
against the best flipper ever

01:21.949 --> 01:24.383
to represent the proud nation
of canada,

01:24.385 --> 01:29.021
mark demers and lucky
making their battlebots
return.

01:29.023 --> 01:31.423
[commentator]
oh, nice flip by lucky!

01:32.893 --> 01:37.229
[kenny] the prehistoric
pachyderm mammoth will also be
in search of its second win

01:37.231 --> 01:41.300
when it steps to former champs
ray billings and tombstone,

01:41.302 --> 01:46.472
desperate for revenge
after a shocking upset loss
in its opening round fight.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.307
[commentator]
oh, what a shock!

01:48.309 --> 01:53.979
[kenny] as the once mighty
king lost a step,
we'll find out later tonight.

01:53.981 --> 01:57.182
And all roads lead
to our monster main event

01:57.184 --> 02:01.220
where the wild man
martin mason and mad catter

02:01.222 --> 02:04.656
will bring their signature
brand of chaos to the party

02:04.658 --> 02:07.626
to dance with jamison go
and sawblaze.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.995
Jamison is a man possessed
this season

02:09.997 --> 02:13.899
and told us mad catter
is just another piece of metal

02:13.901 --> 02:17.636
to rip through on its way
to the giant nut.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.272
[commentator]
sawblaze is a beast!

02:20.274 --> 02:22.007
[kenny]
but kicking things off,

02:22.009 --> 02:25.878
we've got a match up sure
to deliver a plethora of pain.

02:25.880 --> 02:29.882
It's bunny sauriol
and the bay area bomber malice

02:29.884 --> 02:32.918
bringing bad intentions
into the box

02:32.920 --> 02:37.956
to face the hometown heroes,
las vegas' own jackpot.

02:39.226 --> 02:41.527
You guys ready
to get it started?

02:45.633 --> 02:48.634
They're ready.
Faruq, take it away.

02:50.337 --> 02:54.840
Ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready?

02:54.842 --> 02:58.477
It's robot fighting time!

03:09.223 --> 03:10.923
In the red square,

03:10.925 --> 03:13.825
a hard-hitting bot
with the head engineer

03:13.827 --> 03:17.262
who's got killer instinct
and some killer bunny ears.

03:17.264 --> 03:19.198
Think bots are just for boys?

03:19.200 --> 03:20.999
You're wrong
and you'll be reeling.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.701
She'll knock you out
of the pass

03:22.703 --> 03:27.940
and right through
the glass ceiling,
it's malice!

03:33.547 --> 03:38.217
And here comes malice,
led by the one and only
bunny sauriol.

03:38.219 --> 03:43.956
They enter this match at 0-1
after getting slapped around
by tantrum.

03:43.958 --> 03:47.626
That's right.
This team has had weapon
issues for two years now.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.928
It was radio control
problems last time.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.964
And they think
they've got it figured out.

03:51.966 --> 03:55.867
If they can get this weapon
to function properly
inside the box,

03:55.869 --> 03:58.370
malice is a legitimate
knockout threat.

04:03.644 --> 04:07.279
In the blue square,
this bot is from right here
in vegas

04:07.281 --> 04:09.181
and after he gives you
a pounding,

04:09.183 --> 04:12.351
they'll find
your body floating
in the bellagio fountain.

04:12.353 --> 04:17.055
You want to win,
you'll get stabbed like caesar
and be totally dead.

04:17.057 --> 04:19.891
He'll leave you like the luxor
with a hole in your head,

04:19.893 --> 04:22.361
it's jackpot!

04:26.233 --> 04:31.603
[chris] here comes jackpot led
by the tandem of jeff waters
and robert stehn.

04:31.605 --> 04:35.173
Man, I love the paint job
on that front wedge,
that is special.

04:35.175 --> 04:38.644
So, why don't you put me down
for 100 on black 22, kenny?

04:38.646 --> 04:40.545
[kenny]
always bet on black, chris.

04:40.547 --> 04:43.415
Jackpot enters
with a record of 1-0

04:43.417 --> 04:47.319
after taking down deadlift
in an unaired fight earlier
this season.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.755
That ended up being
a pushing match.

04:49.757 --> 04:53.025
But I expect this one
to be way more violent.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.361
Check out that weapon
they call heartbreaker,

04:56.363 --> 05:00.899
an ar 400 disc that only cost
them 80 bucks to replace.

05:00.901 --> 05:03.101
So they have no problem
throwing it into the fire

05:03.103 --> 05:07.072
and going full send
on every hit.

05:07.074 --> 05:10.909
For the jackpot fight we're
gonna go with the normal
rolling blackout,

05:10.911 --> 05:12.944
which is our big
dual-sided weapon.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.980
They're going to run their
plow, of course,

05:14.982 --> 05:17.749
wedges in general are the bane
of spinner's existence.

05:17.751 --> 05:22.888
So it's going to be two very
large hitting robots
with huge impacts.

05:22.890 --> 05:26.058
We'll try to stack that upper
deck with a couple jackpots.

05:26.060 --> 05:29.961
Jeff was actually on malice
before jackpot.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.763
I know that bot
inside and out,

05:31.765 --> 05:33.365
so we should be able
to pick that thing apart.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.967
We're going to box rush them
with a giant wedge.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.369
We're just not gonna
let them spin up.

05:37.371 --> 05:39.938
And we're gonna keep on
hitting them
with the heartbreaker.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.673
This is gonna be
a great fight.

05:41.675 --> 05:45.444
We have two
high energy spinners,
so what more can you ask for?

05:48.148 --> 05:51.950
Jackpot! Jackpot! Jackpot!

05:53.654 --> 05:57.556
[chris] the las vegas crowd
showing their team some love.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.991
<i> [bot] robots activate.</i>

06:02.896 --> 06:07.199
[chris]
and let's welcome in the third
member of our team tonight.

06:07.201 --> 06:09.568
He is the bot whisperer,
peter abrahamson.

06:09.570 --> 06:10.936
All right, pete.

06:10.938 --> 06:13.939
Malice always talks
about wanting to be
the most destructive bot.

06:13.941 --> 06:16.808
Well, this thing has gotta
get working then tonight.

06:16.810 --> 06:20.445
Yeah, they brought one hell
of a weapon on the end
of that robot.

06:20.447 --> 06:22.781
They've got what they call
rolling blackout,

06:22.783 --> 06:29.254
which has s7 hardened teeth
on it that are held in
with these ar 500 brackets.

06:29.256 --> 06:32.624
Now the bracket holds
the tooth to the weapon's bar

06:32.626 --> 06:36.261
for higher durability in those
big impacts with verts.

06:36.263 --> 06:39.631
Will this lead to a better
reliability against jackpot?

06:39.633 --> 06:40.966
We'll see.

06:41.402 --> 06:42.567
[man] go jackpot!

06:44.304 --> 06:46.104
<i> [bot] red team, ready.</i>

06:46.106 --> 06:48.206
Cheers!

06:48.208 --> 06:53.812
-[laughing]
<i> -[bot] blue team, ready.</i>

06:53.814 --> 06:56.648
Got a lucky rabbit foot.

06:56.650 --> 06:59.851
[chris] oh, you got to love
jeff, who, of course,
is a vegas plumber

06:59.853 --> 07:02.087
when he's not fighting robots.

07:11.098 --> 07:14.299
Jackpot 4-0 all-time
in the qualifiers.

07:14.301 --> 07:18.003
Let's see if they can keep
that hot streak going here.

07:22.376 --> 07:24.009
Let the bot battle begin!

07:24.011 --> 07:27.279
Here comes jackpot
out of box rush.

07:27.281 --> 07:30.081
Heartbreaker takes one
right on the blade.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.383
Huge hit there.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.118
Oh!

07:33.253 --> 07:34.352
Oh!

07:34.354 --> 07:37.389
[kenny]
two power shots by malice.

07:37.391 --> 07:40.225
[chris]
keep an eye on malice's
weapon in this fight.

07:40.227 --> 07:41.626
Oh!

07:41.628 --> 07:44.029
We saw it go down early
against tantrum.

07:44.431 --> 07:45.630
Weapon on weapon.

07:45.632 --> 07:48.133
That is big time right there.

07:48.135 --> 07:52.003
So far that spinner on malice
still going strong, kenny.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.405
Oh.

07:53.407 --> 07:55.907
[kenny] I tell you what,
chris, malice looks way faster

07:55.909 --> 07:57.976
than we saw him
in their first fight.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.845
[chris] oh, and that big
time...

07:59.847 --> 08:02.280
[kenny] took it in front,
rolling, now takes a shot.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.316
[chris] but there it goes
spinning back up.

08:04.318 --> 08:07.419
It's a much stronger
malice here tonight.

08:07.421 --> 08:08.987
[kenny] what a great fight so
far.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.989
Malice going right out.

08:10.991 --> 08:14.292
Oh, nice counter shot
by jackpot.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.394
[chris] malice just eludes
the pulverizer.

08:16.396 --> 08:19.498
[kenny]
oh, malice looks a little
dizzy after that one though.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.967
[chris] might need some
smelling salts.

08:21.969 --> 08:24.102
[kenny] but jackpot right
on the grind.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.770
They are relentless.

08:25.772 --> 08:29.040
I'm not sure there's anything
that can stop that weapon.

08:30.410 --> 08:35.146
[chris] huge jump by jackpot,
and glass rains down inside
the battle box.

08:35.148 --> 08:36.114
That was awesome.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.450
[kenny] it just took out a
lot, chris.

08:39.520 --> 08:42.787
[chris] jackpot trying to put
malice up on the screws.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.256
Oh, my goodness!

08:44.258 --> 08:46.324
[kenny] let's see if those
screws will reverse

08:46.326 --> 08:48.760
and dump malice back into
play. It does.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.262
Unbelievable!

08:50.264 --> 08:53.999
[chris] oh, jackpot right
on malice's behind.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.901
[kenny] malice is hurt badly,
chris.

08:55.903 --> 08:59.070
Look at them
just crab walking now.

08:59.072 --> 09:02.641
[chris] and here comes jackpot
to try and finish the job.

09:02.643 --> 09:03.875
[kenny] and jackpot...

09:03.877 --> 09:05.243
Oh, it's starting to smoke.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.312
Jackpot is starting to smoke.

09:07.314 --> 09:11.082
[kenny] that may be
the weapon motor, chris,
but the drive looks okay.

09:11.084 --> 09:13.685
Malice is gonna get counted
out here.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.387
Ten, nine...

09:15.522 --> 09:19.024
[chris] and there it is,
kenny florian,
the countdown has started.

09:19.026 --> 09:25.230
And the hometown boys
from jackpot are gonna kick
off the night with a victory.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.665
That's a knockout!

09:29.102 --> 09:32.037
[kenny] jackpot is one nasty
robot.

09:36.310 --> 09:38.610
Man, if you like weapon
on weapon crime,

09:38.612 --> 09:40.979
you stopped
at the right place.

09:40.981 --> 09:44.015
[chris] well, listen, I don't
care if you're team jackpot
or team malice,

09:44.017 --> 09:46.151
you're gonna need
some tylenol after this one.

09:46.153 --> 09:48.086
Some serious hits.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.957
[kenny] rolling blackout,
the weapon on malice
was very impressive

09:51.959 --> 09:56.061
but they got broken down
by heartbreaker,
the weapon of jackpot.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.462
That thing is lethal.

09:57.464 --> 09:59.497
[chris] take a look at this
shot from jackpot,

09:59.499 --> 10:03.835
[chris] sending shrapnel
flying up to the ceiling
and shattering a light.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.537
That is terrifying.

10:06.673 --> 10:08.673
And here it is again
from outside the box.

10:08.675 --> 10:11.710
That is so darn cool.

10:11.712 --> 10:15.246
Hey, give malice credit
for hanging in
as long as it could.

10:15.248 --> 10:18.483
But there was simply
no recovering from that shot.

10:18.485 --> 10:21.653
The hometown heroes,
team jackpot,

10:21.655 --> 10:25.857
they keep their hot streak
in the qualifiers alive.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.460
Viva las vegas!

10:32.966 --> 10:35.767
Robert and jeff,
congratulations.

10:35.769 --> 10:39.604
Jeff, it sure looks like
you guys hit a lot harder
this year.

10:39.606 --> 10:41.840
We... We really stepped it up
this game

10:41.842 --> 10:44.175
and believe it or not,
that weapon
is actually lighter

10:44.177 --> 10:45.143
than double diamonds.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.212
It's just we have more
power behind it

10:47.214 --> 10:49.748
and we can utilize it
better now that we can drive.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.217
Both you and malice
are devastating bots.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.319
Were you nervous
about this matchup?

10:54.321 --> 10:57.288
Oh, yeah.
I mean, malice
is a big spinner

10:57.290 --> 11:00.191
and as you saw, malice
was doing, you know,

11:00.193 --> 11:01.893
turning us around very easily.

11:01.895 --> 11:04.029
So it was... It was very
scary.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.163
Well, guys, congratulations.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.431
We know you're a bot
on a budget.

11:06.433 --> 11:09.067
And, jeff, you're a full-time
plumber as well.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.402
Kenny's a little embarrassed
to ask

11:10.404 --> 11:12.170
but he blew up
the toilet in his hotel.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.938
Can you help out?

11:16.677 --> 11:18.009
-We'll take that as a yes.
-All right.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.411
Thanks, buddy.

11:28.121 --> 11:32.190
I'm telling you, jackpot
just will not lose
in the regular season.

11:32.192 --> 11:36.094
You know, last year we were
like, "okay, rookie bots.
Sometimes you get lucky."

11:36.096 --> 11:37.128
this thing ain't lucky
anymore.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.463
No question about it.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.932
To one up what they did last
season is really impressive.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.434
That's a bot to watch.

11:42.436 --> 11:46.104
[chris] we are just getting
started here in sin city
tonight.

11:46.106 --> 11:48.640
Coming up,
captain charles guan

11:48.642 --> 11:53.111
will try to overhaul
ribbot's entire face.

11:53.113 --> 11:57.182
It's cosmetic surgery time
when ribbot takes on overhaul.

11:57.184 --> 11:59.117
<i> That's next on battlebots.</i>

12:09.429 --> 12:10.762
We are back here
<i> on battlebots.</i>

12:10.764 --> 12:13.298
That's kenny florian.
I am chris rose.

12:13.300 --> 12:18.069
And up next, ribbot is back
into the box for the second
time in the 2021 season.

12:18.071 --> 12:21.372
They dismantled defender
in their first fight.

12:21.374 --> 12:26.344
David jin in led this bot
all the way to the top eight
a season ago.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.879
They're ready to take
that next step.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.681
Very impressive so far.

12:29.683 --> 12:32.917
[kenny] absolutely.
This team is primed
for another big season.

12:32.919 --> 12:36.855
Ribbot is a modular bot
that could attack you
in a variety of ways.

12:36.857 --> 12:40.592
The team made the switch
to brushless weapon motors
this year,

12:40.594 --> 12:43.895
which gives them a much
greater power to weight ratio.

12:43.897 --> 12:49.234
And we saw that translate
in their dominating
performance against defender.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.936
And I'm excited
for the return of overhaul.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.105
Captained by charles guan,

12:54.107 --> 12:58.276
we first met this team
all the way back in 2015

12:58.278 --> 13:02.714
when they went toe to toe
with legends like bite force
and lockjaw.

13:02.716 --> 13:06.351
But keep this in mind,
they haven't competed
since season three.

13:06.353 --> 13:08.987
And kenny taking two years
<i> off from battlebots,</i>

13:08.989 --> 13:13.124
it's kind of like stepping
away for a decade
in more traditional sports.

13:13.126 --> 13:16.561
[kenny] definitely. The
technology is advancing
exponentially,

13:16.563 --> 13:19.597
and so is the lethality
of these robots.

13:19.599 --> 13:23.968
That said, overhaul
is one of the sturdiest
control bots in the field

13:23.970 --> 13:27.672
and it has a history
of taking on big punchers
and surviving.

13:28.775 --> 13:31.109
The stakes are high
for charles guan this season

13:31.111 --> 13:36.481
as he looks to prove he still
belongs in this modern era
of robot combat.

13:36.483 --> 13:39.484
[chris] let's see
what charles guan's got.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.252
Faruq.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.924
In the red square,
you know what they say,

13:45.926 --> 13:48.326
if you're feeling froggy
then leap.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.763
But be careful
because this bot can put you
straight to sleep.

13:51.765 --> 13:55.900
This amphibious assassin
can do you really bad,

13:55.902 --> 13:59.204
and then bury your body
right under his lily pad.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.439
It's ribbot!

14:06.246 --> 14:10.849
[chris] here come the boys
from wpi looking for their
second win of the season.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.083
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.484
What's happened
to our green friend?

14:13.486 --> 14:15.954
Did he get left in the freezer
or something?

14:15.956 --> 14:17.322
Why is he blue?

14:17.324 --> 14:20.325
[kenny] yeah, captain david
jin said they painted ribbot
blue

14:20.327 --> 14:23.928
as an homage to charles guan
in overhaul.

14:23.930 --> 14:25.363
But I think they're just
trying to piss him off.

14:25.365 --> 14:29.033
Looks like they're going
with their undercutting weapon
for this fight.

14:29.035 --> 14:31.102
Ribbot is able
to drive inverted.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.404
So if overhaul
does manage to flip them,

14:33.406 --> 14:36.574
this weapon will be
just as lethal, chris.

14:39.412 --> 14:42.347
In the blue square,
just like little john,

14:42.349 --> 14:45.350
this bot now resides
in atlanta, ga.

14:45.352 --> 14:49.287
Ask him if he's tough
and he'll tell you, "okay."

14:49.289 --> 14:51.890
he's come all this way
to fight for the nut.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.358
You can beg him for mercy,

14:53.360 --> 14:56.160
but he'll just answer, "what?"

14:56.162 --> 15:01.332
make some noise, yeah,
for overhaul!

15:05.338 --> 15:06.971
[chris] for the first time
in three years,

15:06.973 --> 15:09.841
charles guan is walking
through the tunnel.

15:09.843 --> 15:11.809
The cat ears are back.

15:11.811 --> 15:13.878
Let's take a look
at that bad boy.

15:13.880 --> 15:16.347
He hasn't changed, kenny.

15:16.349 --> 15:19.050
[kenny] yeah, it's still the
same lifter-grabber design,

15:19.052 --> 15:22.387
but to keep up with this
year's lightning fast field,

15:22.389 --> 15:27.759
charles has overhauled
overhaul's drive systems
and added bigger wheels.

15:27.761 --> 15:30.061
He hopes that means
increased mobility,

15:30.063 --> 15:34.933
which he said should help him
both offensively
and defensively.

15:37.971 --> 15:40.071
In our last fight against
defender, we used
a vertical spinner module,

15:40.073 --> 15:43.074
but since we redesigned
both modules from scratch
this season,

15:43.076 --> 15:45.276
we really wanted a chance
to test our other modules.

15:45.278 --> 15:48.079
So our plan going
into this fight is to use
our second module,

15:48.081 --> 15:50.214
the undercutter,
to fight overhaul.

15:50.216 --> 15:53.351
We think that we are either
gonna be able to get around
his exposed wheels

15:53.353 --> 15:55.987
or potentially blast
some holes in his wedge.

15:55.989 --> 15:58.790
Both robots are super fast
and super maneuverable.

15:58.792 --> 16:01.960
I also know that charles
is a very experienced builder,
very experienced driver.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.995
There's no way we can
underestimate him.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.229
It's gonna be a good match.

16:05.231 --> 16:07.231
Overhaul is still
the good old grab

16:07.233 --> 16:08.833
and lift bot that it ever was.

16:08.835 --> 16:10.168
My whole plan with the ribbot,

16:10.170 --> 16:12.170
they're a pretty compact
four-wheel drive bot
with a weapon,

16:12.172 --> 16:13.838
I think I know
how to deal with that

16:13.840 --> 16:16.607
and I'm just gonna try
to just go in at the start
and just grab it.

16:16.609 --> 16:19.577
And if I get them
into the claws of overhaul,

16:19.579 --> 16:23.147
they're gonna get a tour
of every single arena hazard
that they have.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.950
And then hopefully
I can end it by just throwing
them on a shelf

16:25.952 --> 16:27.652
and seeing
how they deal with it.

16:29.956 --> 16:31.990
<i> [bot] robots activate.</i>

16:33.360 --> 16:37.895
[chris] lot of wicked smart
guys from massachusetts
going head-to-head here.

16:37.897 --> 16:40.031
Team overhaul from mit,

16:40.033 --> 16:44.369
team ribbot representing
worcester polytechnic
institute.

16:44.371 --> 16:47.105
Might be some bragging rights
on the line in this one.

16:47.107 --> 16:50.074
[chris] no big deal.
Those are my safety scores.

17:14.134 --> 17:17.902
Let the bot battle begin!

17:17.904 --> 17:20.505
Overhaul going right
into the mug of ribbot.

17:20.507 --> 17:23.374
[kenny] overhaul so sturdy
though, chris.

17:23.843 --> 17:25.076
[chris] whoa.

17:25.078 --> 17:27.078
Nice shot there by ribbot.

17:28.114 --> 17:29.580
-Oh!
-Oh!

17:29.582 --> 17:30.915
-Oh!
-Uh-oh!

17:30.917 --> 17:34.218
[chris] ribbot's speed
getting the best
of overhaul here, kenny.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.421
[kenny] ribbot making overhaul
dizzy.

17:36.423 --> 17:39.123
And I'm not sure
they're moving, chris.
This might be a knockout.

17:39.125 --> 17:42.226
[chris] oh, yeah, that left
front tire is done.

17:42.228 --> 17:45.363
Ribbot is driving circles
around overhaul,

17:45.365 --> 17:47.999
almost [inaudible]
the bot from mit here.

17:48.001 --> 17:50.168
The countdown is on

17:50.170 --> 17:56.307
and ribbot is gonna make
quick work of a very tough
robot in overhaul.

17:56.376 --> 17:57.608
[inaudible]

17:57.844 --> 17:59.977
[kenny] he's trying to give a
nudge. He wants a better
fight.

17:59.979 --> 18:03.514
But it's another quick
knockout for team ribbot.

18:05.085 --> 18:10.388
[chris] very, very impressive
by david jin and his crew.

18:14.227 --> 18:17.195
[chris] don't blink because
this one didn't last long,
kenny.

18:17.197 --> 18:18.830
[kenny] man, it was all
ribbot.

18:18.832 --> 18:21.265
This team
is looking really sharp,

18:21.267 --> 18:24.035
really dangerous
just shot after shot.

18:24.037 --> 18:25.670
And that was pretty much it.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.839
[chris] you know, overhaul
has a reputation

18:27.841 --> 18:30.041
for being able
to absorb punishment

18:30.043 --> 18:32.143
from heavy hitters
and extend fights.

18:32.145 --> 18:34.645
But ribbot just put it
to sleep in a hurry

18:34.647 --> 18:38.416
and put the field on notice
as well.

18:38.418 --> 18:42.420
Spun him around,
went right at him,
one, two, three combination

18:42.422 --> 18:44.155
and that was it. Whoo!

18:44.157 --> 18:46.290
Bot parts everywhere.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.798
David jin, did you
even break a sweat?

18:53.800 --> 18:56.000
I was breaking a sweat
before that match started.

18:56.002 --> 18:57.335
Um, but once
the match was going,

18:57.337 --> 18:59.170
I think we were pretty calm,
pretty collected.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.838
We're trying to go fast.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.306
I think it worked out
pretty well.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.375
What's the difference
in ribbot this year?

19:04.377 --> 19:06.677
I think we've gotten much
better at keeping
our weapons spinning.

19:06.679 --> 19:09.046
We're able to spin up
much faster after impacts,

19:09.048 --> 19:11.649
which means we can hit them
a lot more consistently.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.384
What do you think
your 2-0 start

19:13.386 --> 19:16.254
with a pair of knockouts says
to the selection committee
so far?

19:16.256 --> 19:17.855
I think it looks pretty good.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.624
We'll see what they give us
for our third match up.

19:19.626 --> 19:20.791
But we'll go from here.

19:20.793 --> 19:24.095
All right, david,
congratulations to you
and team ribbot.

19:31.571 --> 19:35.173
All right, david jin didn't
want to oversell himself
to the selection committee.

19:35.175 --> 19:37.108
If you were part
of the selection committee

19:37.110 --> 19:41.045
with a 2-0 start
and a pair of knockouts,
what would you say?

19:41.047 --> 19:44.048
I mean, right now he's looking
extremely dominant,

19:44.050 --> 19:46.117
he hasn't been challenged,
period.

19:46.119 --> 19:50.521
So, yeah, to knock out a bot
that resilient in 40 seconds,

19:50.523 --> 19:52.757
I would want to fight
this team.

19:52.759 --> 19:58.229
[chris] coming up next, blade,
the rookie horizontal spinner
from south korea.

19:58.231 --> 20:03.367
We'll try to take the sting
out of the deadly hammer saw
of skorpios.

20:03.369 --> 20:08.439
And later tonight, get ready
for some wwe style pandemonium

20:08.441 --> 20:11.075
when martin mason
and mad catter

20:11.077 --> 20:15.346
take on the flaming
green machine sawblaze
in our main event.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.647
Stay tuned.

20:25.358 --> 20:26.891
<i> We are back on battlebots.</i>

20:26.893 --> 20:30.027
And kenny florian,
one of the things
I love about this sport,

20:30.029 --> 20:32.863
it is a true
international competition.

20:32.865 --> 20:36.834
So we want to welcome
our first ever competitor
from seoul, south korea,

20:36.836 --> 20:39.070
cheog-gyu hwang.
He is the engineer of blade.

20:39.072 --> 20:41.138
Now he's not new
to combat robotics.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.940
He's competed
and done well over in china.

20:42.942 --> 20:45.042
But he had such a big smile
on his face

20:45.044 --> 20:46.744
when he was talking
about being a rookie

20:46.746 --> 20:48.646
all over again here
<i> at battlebots.</i>

20:48.648 --> 20:50.147
[kenny] that's right.
They may be rookies,

20:50.149 --> 20:53.851
but the field has been
scouting this team online
for years now.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.887
The bot's already gotten a lot
of attention back in the pits

20:56.889 --> 21:01.259
and everyone's chomping
at the bit to see it make
its debut on the big stage.

21:01.261 --> 21:03.761
International success
is one thing,

21:03.763 --> 21:07.031
but winning fights here
<i> at battlebots</i>
<i> is a measuring stick</i>

21:07.033 --> 21:09.333
you just can't simulate
anywhere else.

21:11.271 --> 21:15.806
Taking on skorpios,
co-captained by the husband
and wife combination

21:15.808 --> 21:18.175
of zach lytle
and diana tarlson.

21:18.177 --> 21:20.678
Now last season
was really special for them.

21:20.680 --> 21:24.649
During the pandemic,
they nearly lost
their entire business

21:24.651 --> 21:28.252
but they turned around,
had an incredible run here
<i> at battlebots.</i>

21:28.254 --> 21:30.988
They beat tombstone
in a main event.

21:30.990 --> 21:34.225
They won a bounty tournament
and gained a ton of respect.

21:34.227 --> 21:36.460
Now their business
has actually bounced back

21:36.462 --> 21:40.031
and they feel like the sky
is the limit for their robot.

21:40.033 --> 21:40.965
[kenny] that's right.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.066
And they did that really
with the weapon

21:42.068 --> 21:44.035
that wasn't really
at full power.

21:44.037 --> 21:46.671
So they believe they have
the best skorpios yet.

21:47.206 --> 21:48.339
This is gonna be fun.

21:48.341 --> 21:50.474
Faruq, take it away.

21:53.746 --> 21:57.515
In the red square
from seoul, south korea,

21:57.517 --> 22:02.787
forget bts,
he's here to make you rip.

22:02.789 --> 22:05.256
It's blade!

22:08.961 --> 22:10.561
[chris] look at that bot,
kenny.

22:10.563 --> 22:13.431
It looks kind of like
a klingon spaceship.

22:13.433 --> 22:16.901
[kenny] yeah, blade is a
beautiful heavy-hitting
horizontal spinner

22:16.903 --> 22:18.169
with a wedge in the rear.

22:18.171 --> 22:21.605
They're going with their
50-pound bar for this fight.

22:21.607 --> 22:23.674
Tough matchup for them
out of the gate though.

22:23.676 --> 22:27.745
Skorpios has a history
of success
against horizontals.

22:27.747 --> 22:29.246
Blade will need
to create space

22:29.248 --> 22:31.215
in order to get
its weapon up to speed

22:31.217 --> 22:36.654
and then avoid going
face first into that giant
front plow of skorpios.

22:40.827 --> 22:45.796
In the blue square,
from san francisco,
california...

22:45.798 --> 22:52.036
Get over here
and take a beating
from skorpios.

22:54.340 --> 22:57.508
[chris] there is zach
in front leading the charge.

22:57.510 --> 23:00.010
Bots are gonna fly.
Bots are gonna die.

23:00.012 --> 23:02.079
[chris] I think they're
already talking trash.

23:02.081 --> 23:05.449
Listen to the crowd.
They flat out love it.

23:09.288 --> 23:10.654
[kenny] look at that wedge,
man.

23:10.857 --> 23:13.958
I gotta put that on the front
of my car,
nobody'll mess with me.

23:14.827 --> 23:16.594
[chris] that wedge is
intimidating.

23:16.596 --> 23:20.264
But the team is most excited
about its new hammer saw.

23:20.266 --> 23:24.568
It's spinning at more than
double the rpms
it was last year.

23:24.570 --> 23:27.405
They expect it to deliver
more damage as a result

23:27.407 --> 23:32.977
and told us that skorpios
is now a legitimate contender
for the giant nut.

23:33.413 --> 23:34.879
Skorpios!

23:34.881 --> 23:38.015
Skorpios! Skorpios!

23:38.985 --> 23:41.152
Blades, wheel guards
and wedges,

23:41.154 --> 23:44.855
pull him off the ground
and let him slide
and go crazy.

23:44.857 --> 23:46.524
We're gonna try
to take advantage of that.

23:46.526 --> 23:48.259
Which could be a detriment
to us

23:48.261 --> 23:52.763
because if you drive it
like you stole it
into blade's craziness,

23:52.765 --> 23:56.434
then that could go bad
for our... For our hammer
stick.

23:56.436 --> 23:59.303
Well, we'll just have
to be a little more patient
than normal.

23:59.305 --> 24:02.306
Yeah, patience is a virtue.

24:02.308 --> 24:04.008
And we don't have that one.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.530
<i> [bot] robots activate.</i>

24:29.168 --> 24:32.136
[chris] kenny, what do you
know about the driver of
blade?

24:32.138 --> 24:33.771
[kenny] well, her name is ju
sangeun.

24:33.773 --> 24:35.639
She's actually
a professional violinist

24:35.641 --> 24:38.175
and is used to performing
under pressure, chris.

24:38.177 --> 24:40.945
She's been driving
blade since 2019.

24:40.947 --> 24:46.317
But this will be
the biggest test by far
of her young career.

24:46.319 --> 24:49.019
[chris] for more on her
opponent's strategy tonight,

24:49.021 --> 24:51.021
let's throw it over
to the bot whisperer.

24:51.023 --> 24:52.923
Pete, what do you have?

24:52.925 --> 24:53.991
If you remember last year,

24:53.993 --> 24:57.228
skorpios has three large
pieces of armor

24:57.230 --> 25:00.064
that are bolted
onto the front,
each independent,

25:00.066 --> 25:02.132
and they got ripped off
and damaged pretty heavily

25:02.134 --> 25:03.267
during their fight
with tombstone.

25:03.269 --> 25:05.870
They're taking all those
lessons from tombstone

25:05.872 --> 25:09.106
and they've welded
the back side
and the front side

25:09.108 --> 25:12.943
to each side of the armor
making one continuous piece.

25:12.945 --> 25:14.879
So this is what's going to
probably save them

25:14.881 --> 25:16.680
against a very
tombstone-like robot.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.940
[kenny] let the bot battle
begin!

25:42.942 --> 25:47.144
And here comes skorpios
out of box rushing
and takes it to blade.

25:47.146 --> 25:49.213
Trying to prevent
that horizontal spinner

25:49.215 --> 25:51.148
from getting up to speed,
chris.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.183
Blade retreats
into the short corner.

25:53.185 --> 25:58.122
Skorpios' all over it
and now zach lytle firing up
that hammer saw.

25:58.124 --> 25:59.857
[kenny] oh, my goodness.

25:59.859 --> 26:02.026
[chris] look at that weapon
go to work.

26:02.028 --> 26:06.664
Skorpios has already opened up
a serious gash
on the backside of blade.

26:06.666 --> 26:08.632
The bot
from seoul, south korea

26:08.634 --> 26:10.534
trying to create
some space here

26:10.536 --> 26:12.636
but skorpios won't give
an inch.

26:12.638 --> 26:18.809
That hammer saw threatening
to do more damage
with every major hit, kenny.

26:18.811 --> 26:21.879
[kenny] yeah, this is what
zach is known for,
aggressive driving,

26:21.881 --> 26:24.148
just staying right on top
of his opponents.

26:24.150 --> 26:27.618
[chris] and just took another
big chunk out of blade.

26:27.620 --> 26:30.421
[kenny] blade's weapon
still active though.

26:30.423 --> 26:35.059
[chris] oh, skorpios continues
to rack up the aggression
and damage points.

26:35.061 --> 26:39.196
Blade tries to counter
but skorpios says,
"no way, my friend."

26:39.665 --> 26:40.764
I'm stuck, I'm stuck.

26:40.933 --> 26:44.101
[kenny] skorpios' saw is stuck
in blade's skull, chris.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.703
That is medieval.

26:45.705 --> 26:49.974
[chris] oh, look at that
control, look at that driving
from zach lytle.

26:49.976 --> 26:55.112
Blade's horizontal spinner
is still active
but has been a non-factor.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.814
And skorpios shoves blade
into the corner,

26:56.816 --> 27:00.184
lets the pulverizer
get in on the action too.

27:00.186 --> 27:04.121
[kenny] this is easily
the most powerful
that we've seen skorpios.

27:04.123 --> 27:07.124
That primary weapon
is doing some
serious damage here.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.392
[chris] holy smoke!

27:08.394 --> 27:11.629
Can blade even move?
Just barely.

27:12.064 --> 27:14.231
90 seconds remaining.

27:14.233 --> 27:19.169
Skorpios backs up now,
playing a little red light,
green light

27:19.171 --> 27:21.672
with the bot from south korea.

27:21.674 --> 27:26.043
Skorpios saying, if you move,
there will be consequences.

27:26.045 --> 27:28.345
You gotta tell me you got
some kind of movement
in there.

27:28.347 --> 27:29.580
I gotta see...

27:29.582 --> 27:32.149
[chris] the ref issuing
a warning to team blade.

27:32.351 --> 27:33.484
Whoa!

27:33.753 --> 27:36.954
Skorpios takes a friendly
fire from its own pulverizer.

27:37.890 --> 27:42.226
Now nudges blade
under the 100-pound
hammer well.

27:42.228 --> 27:43.227
[kenny] oh, my goodness.

27:43.229 --> 27:47.631
This has been all skorpios
all the time.

27:47.633 --> 27:49.967
[chris] under a minute left to
go.

27:49.969 --> 27:55.072
And why doesn't skorpios
just back off and let blade
get counted out here, kenny?

27:55.074 --> 27:57.808
[kenny] I think zach and diana
wanna milk

27:57.810 --> 28:00.144
every second
of fight time
they have tonight

28:00.146 --> 28:03.681
and put skorpios
through its paces.

28:03.683 --> 28:07.017
[chris] well, listen, they
think they have a championship
bot this season

28:07.019 --> 28:09.086
and after this
awesome performance,

28:09.088 --> 28:11.955
I am not gonna say otherwise.

28:11.957 --> 28:15.125
[kenny] what a brutal
introduction to the big
leagues

28:15.127 --> 28:17.428
for the robot
from south korea.

28:19.098 --> 28:21.799
[chris] skorpios continuing to
engage.

28:21.801 --> 28:23.867
And like so many
of its opponents,

28:23.869 --> 28:29.707
blade has spent all night
trying to avoid
that big front plow.

28:29.709 --> 28:32.509
[kenny] literally taking it
apart piece by piece.

28:33.946 --> 28:36.246
[chris] the kill saw's getting
involved here
in the final moments

28:36.248 --> 28:38.182
of a one-sided match

28:38.184 --> 28:44.388
that saw skorpios
<i> absolutely dominate battlebots</i>
<i> rookie blade.</i>

28:47.626 --> 28:51.829
Either way that final bell
means the decision
will now lie

28:51.831 --> 28:54.832
in the hands of our judges.

28:54.834 --> 28:58.235
[kenny] lisa winter, jason
bardis and derek young,

28:58.237 --> 29:01.171
who are once again scoring
on an 11-point system.

29:01.173 --> 29:03.674
Up to five points
can be awarded for damage,

29:03.676 --> 29:06.910
three for aggression
and three for control.

29:06.912 --> 29:09.980
That was amazing. So good.

29:10.649 --> 29:13.317
[chris] team skorpios all
hugs, and why not,

29:13.319 --> 29:16.787
because start to finish,
kenny, they were so
impressive.

29:16.789 --> 29:17.921
[kenny] yeah, absolutely.

29:17.923 --> 29:21.391
This is the most destructive
we have seen skorpios.

29:21.393 --> 29:24.928
They gave this team
from south korea
quite the welcoming.

29:24.930 --> 29:25.896
Look at that.

29:25.898 --> 29:28.398
First strike just digs
right into that wedge,

29:28.400 --> 29:33.504
takes a huge chunk off,
does it again, the same spot.

29:34.073 --> 29:36.073
Just surgical.

29:36.075 --> 29:40.377
And I really thought
the driving out of zach
was so impressive.

29:40.379 --> 29:42.880
He never allowed blade
a chance to regroup.

29:42.882 --> 29:44.314
[chris] he did it all.

29:44.316 --> 29:47.084
I mean, whether it was
taking chunks out of their
weapon, controlling,

29:47.086 --> 29:50.254
picking them up,
delivering him in other parts
of the battle box,

29:50.256 --> 29:52.923
staying on him,
I mean he really did it all.

29:52.925 --> 29:55.659
I mean, this was like a clinic
here from zach lytle.

29:58.864 --> 30:02.032
The results
from the judges are in.

30:07.907 --> 30:12.342
And the winner
by unanimous decision is...

30:14.280 --> 30:17.414
Skorpios!

30:20.152 --> 30:21.685
We love you, guys.

30:26.091 --> 30:30.093
[chris] zach and diana,
I hate to break up
the love fest over there,

30:30.095 --> 30:33.230
but boy, this is the way
it was supposed to be
with that weapon, huh?

30:33.232 --> 30:38.202
Yes. Yes, the power!

30:38.204 --> 30:41.905
We spent our entire offseason
trying to make
the weapon better.

30:41.907 --> 30:43.974
We made a whole
youtube channel about it.

30:43.976 --> 30:46.877
And we're now turning out
eight times the power

30:46.879 --> 30:50.147
the original weapon had back
in season five.

30:52.151 --> 30:54.351
With that being said,
zach and diana,

30:54.353 --> 30:55.986
you wanna win this thing,
don't you?

30:55.988 --> 30:57.855
Yeah.

30:57.857 --> 31:01.091
-There's a giant nut
and I want to go home with it.
-With our name on it.

31:01.093 --> 31:03.927
Anyway, great first step.
Congratulations.

31:03.929 --> 31:05.329
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

31:10.002 --> 31:11.001
[chris] all right, kenny.

31:11.003 --> 31:13.670
Skorpios is off
to a hot start.

31:13.672 --> 31:15.672
That was the real deal
out of the gate.

31:15.674 --> 31:17.040
No question about it.

31:17.042 --> 31:20.811
Zach lytle and team skorpios,
they were in beast mode.

31:20.813 --> 31:22.312
My goodness.
They did everything.

31:22.314 --> 31:27.084
[chris] and no shame in what
cheog-gyu hwang
and blade did tonight.

31:27.086 --> 31:29.853
They simply ran
into a buzz saw.

31:29.855 --> 31:33.924
Look for them to bounce back
in their next match.

31:33.926 --> 31:36.260
All right, coming up,
will ray billings
need to prepare

31:36.262 --> 31:37.961
a massive grave

31:37.963 --> 31:41.231
or will the prehistoric
mammoth
make tombstone extinct?

31:41.233 --> 31:45.335
It's mammoth against tombstone
<i> and it's next on battlebots.</i>

31:53.345 --> 31:54.378
<i> Welcome back to battlebots.</i>

31:54.380 --> 31:57.014
Do you enjoy watching robots
fight to the death?

31:57.016 --> 31:59.650
Well, I've got
some good news for you.

31:59.652 --> 32:02.786
<i> Next up, former battlebots</i>
<i> champion tombstone</i>

32:02.788 --> 32:08.625
returns to action
after a shocking upset loss
in its opening fight.

32:08.627 --> 32:11.728
Once considered
the most feared machine
on the planet,

32:11.730 --> 32:16.366
it's now been five years
since captain ray billings
hoisted the giant nut.

32:16.368 --> 32:19.269
And as the robot combat world
continues to evolve,

32:19.271 --> 32:23.206
it begs the question,
has tombstone lost a step?

32:24.643 --> 32:27.711
[ray]
<i> I first started in battlebots</i>
<i> a long time ago</i>

32:27.713 --> 32:31.415
and there were always
some robots

32:31.417 --> 32:35.619
when that robot fights,
the pits went empty.

32:37.323 --> 32:38.922
I wanted to clear the pits.

32:38.924 --> 32:42.259
I wanted everybody
to come watch tombstone.

32:42.261 --> 32:43.961
That's what it was.

32:43.963 --> 32:49.333
It was all about making sure
that I just had the biggest
kit available in the sport.

32:53.672 --> 32:57.341
[commentator]
tombstone, the grim reaper
<i> of battlebots.</i>

33:00.846 --> 33:03.313
My reputation
as being that guy

33:03.315 --> 33:04.915
has been around
for a long time.

33:04.917 --> 33:07.184
[commentator]
look at that blade spin.

33:07.186 --> 33:12.089
That right there
is the mike tyson
<i> of battlebots.</i>

33:12.091 --> 33:14.024
2016 was a good year for us.

33:14.026 --> 33:17.661
Everybody fell, nobody
could take
what I had that year

33:17.663 --> 33:19.396
and we just marched
our way to the finals

33:19.398 --> 33:21.064
and went home
with the giant nut.

33:21.066 --> 33:23.800
[commentator]
a new champ is crowned!

33:23.802 --> 33:27.437
Ray billings and tombstone!

33:29.441 --> 33:33.243
[chris] brutal collisions,
kenny. Tombstone looks hurt.

33:33.779 --> 33:35.445
Last year
was a disappointment.

33:35.447 --> 33:39.149
We felt we could have
and should have done better
than we did.

33:39.151 --> 33:42.019
[chris] the former champ,
he's on the ropes.

33:42.021 --> 33:44.588
And in our first fight
this year,

33:44.590 --> 33:46.690
we did take a loss
against captain shrederator.

33:46.692 --> 33:49.593
[chris] tombstone smoking
already and takes a serious
shot.

33:49.595 --> 33:54.631
The thing about this sport
is little itty bitty things
can... Can derail you.

33:54.633 --> 34:00.570
[chris] tombstone's season
goes up in flames,
at least in the early going.

34:04.076 --> 34:08.211
Whenever I don't perform
as well as I think I should,

34:08.213 --> 34:12.315
whenever I don't just dominate
in a match,
you get a lot of that talk,

34:12.317 --> 34:15.252
"oh, my god,
tombstone's not doing
its thing anymore.

34:15.254 --> 34:20.123
It's an old bot.
It's not up to standard
anymore."

34:20.125 --> 34:25.429
go ask anybody who I have hit
whether they think
I don't have it anymore.

34:27.433 --> 34:32.169
Everybody in this building
should be afraid

34:32.171 --> 34:33.904
of what tombstone can do
to their robot.

34:33.906 --> 34:36.640
Every team
should understand that.

34:37.976 --> 34:41.611
If I get the right hit,
you're gonna die.

34:49.655 --> 34:52.122
[chris] kenny, the stakes
could not be any higher for
tombstone

34:52.124 --> 34:54.858
in this match for the second
straight season.

34:54.860 --> 34:58.261
Ray billings has to figure out
a way to dig out
of an 0-1 start.

34:58.263 --> 35:00.764
Well, listen, if anyone
can do it, it's ray billings.

35:00.766 --> 35:04.734
He had a tough out
against a high-energy bot
and captain shrederator.

35:04.736 --> 35:07.671
This one is another
tough fight though.

35:07.673 --> 35:09.372
He's about to face a captain
and robot

35:09.374 --> 35:13.243
who's trying to break the mold
on what a championship robot
looks like.

35:13.245 --> 35:16.079
And that's ricky willems
and his massive machine,
mammoth.

35:16.081 --> 35:19.116
He's coming off of a big
knockout over hijinx,

35:19.118 --> 35:22.986
and beating tombstone tonight
could very well prove
his thesis.

35:22.988 --> 35:26.923
[chris] a lot on the line
for these two bots.

35:26.925 --> 35:29.092
Let's send it over to faruq.

35:34.933 --> 35:37.200
In the red square,

35:37.202 --> 35:41.438
he's the godfather of bots
and he's beaten plenty
of good fellas.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.874
His legend status
is untouchable.

35:43.876 --> 35:46.009
Other bots should be jealous.

35:46.011 --> 35:50.280
Now he's in the land of casino
and his runs
just getting started.

35:50.282 --> 35:54.184
And after he kills you,
we'll call you the departed.

35:54.186 --> 35:58.221
Give it up for tombstone!

36:01.727 --> 36:07.397
[chris] and here comes
the 2016 world champion,
ray billings.

36:07.399 --> 36:12.202
Last time we saw tombstone,
it was practically roasting
marshmallows inside the box.

36:12.204 --> 36:14.971
Kenny, what went wrong
against captain shrederator?

36:14.973 --> 36:18.675
[kenny] well, they switched
the type of batteries that
powered tombstone's blade.

36:18.677 --> 36:23.647
The new batteries are supposed
to provide even more power
to that legendary weapon,

36:23.649 --> 36:25.248
but they've been overheating

36:25.250 --> 36:28.218
and that's what led
to the fire we saw
in their last fight.

36:28.220 --> 36:30.754
They've been playing
with circuits to get it right.

36:30.756 --> 36:35.258
But this is do or die
for the king
of kinetic energy.

36:36.795 --> 36:41.331
In the blue square,
a gigantic launcher
is their combat trick,

36:41.333 --> 36:44.901
and this sucker is big
like a tom hank's flick.

36:44.903 --> 36:49.706
It'll catch you if it can
and you'll get cast away
and thrown.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.808
It'll fling you a green mile

36:51.810 --> 36:57.047
because it's in a league
of its own, it's mammoth!

37:00.986 --> 37:04.354
[chris] if you didn't see
mammoth in its season debut,

37:04.356 --> 37:08.925
that weapon, looking
a little bit different
in the 2021 season.

37:08.927 --> 37:11.461
[kenny] yeah, it's made
from uhmw plastic.

37:11.463 --> 37:14.998
It's the same type
of material huge's wheels
are made from.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.200
It bends but does not break

37:17.202 --> 37:19.803
and it had a ton of success
in its first fight

37:19.805 --> 37:23.039
against another horizontal
spinner in hijinx.

37:33.652 --> 37:36.886
We did some upgrades
to the drivetrain
on tombstone this year.

37:36.888 --> 37:40.190
It's actually
a little bit faster
than it was in the past.

37:40.192 --> 37:43.827
So I'm gonna try to use
that speed to get past

37:43.829 --> 37:47.030
and get to the side,
try to get ahold
of some of the tires.

37:47.032 --> 37:49.432
They're just sitting out there
waiting to get cut offs

37:49.434 --> 37:51.735
if I'm fast enough
to get around them.

37:51.737 --> 37:53.637
Right now we're 0-1.

37:53.639 --> 37:58.008
So, this win is an absolute
must for tombstone.

37:58.010 --> 38:01.211
We have to go in there,
we have to do our thing
and dominate.

38:01.213 --> 38:04.214
And we have to come out
of this with a victory.
It's really important.

38:04.216 --> 38:06.182
Mammoth is a big stick figure.

38:06.184 --> 38:08.652
There is a lot
for him to chop up.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.287
We need to feed
as much plastic

38:10.289 --> 38:12.622
and as much steel
and as much titanium

38:12.624 --> 38:15.225
into the mouth of their weapon
and hope that it breaks

38:15.227 --> 38:19.029
and jams up and flips them
on their side and bounces them
around the arena.

38:19.031 --> 38:23.099
Our only shot here
is to make sure tombstone
breaks themselves

38:23.101 --> 38:24.668
and that we outlast him.

38:30.776 --> 38:32.575
<i> [bot] robots activate.</i>

38:36.081 --> 38:38.281
[chris] here's a little
factoid for you.

38:38.283 --> 38:41.151
Ricky willems and mammoth
have won their first fight

38:41.153 --> 38:43.887
in every season
they've competed in,

38:43.889 --> 38:46.089
but they've never won
their second.

38:48.193 --> 38:52.796
Will mammoth prove
that an unconventional design
can dominate?

38:52.798 --> 38:55.332
Or will tombstone remind
the field

38:55.334 --> 38:59.336
it is still the baddest blade
in the business?

38:59.338 --> 39:02.939
Find out next
<i> when battlebots continues.</i>

39:10.716 --> 39:12.649
<i> Welcome back to battlebots</i>

39:12.651 --> 39:18.455
where mammoth is ready
to battle the grim reaper
himself, tombstone.

39:18.457 --> 39:23.827
Captain ray billings' season
could be on the line
after an 0-1 start.

39:23.829 --> 39:26.329
Let's get it on!

39:39.277 --> 39:42.312
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

39:42.314 --> 39:46.416
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

39:46.418 --> 39:48.351
We got this. I got this.

39:48.353 --> 39:53.156
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

39:53.158 --> 39:56.059
[chris] let the bot battle
begin!

39:57.162 --> 39:59.662
[kenny] a huge shot from
tombstone!

40:00.799 --> 40:02.265
-Oh, my goodness!
-Look at that!

40:02.267 --> 40:04.868
[chris] pieces of mammoth
flying everywhere.

40:04.870 --> 40:06.102
Oh, baby!

40:06.104 --> 40:07.504
[kenny] that's a big one.

40:07.506 --> 40:11.808
And the right wheel of mammoth
is now hanging on
by a thread, chris.

40:11.810 --> 40:15.078
But did tombstone take
some damage there too?

40:15.080 --> 40:19.315
It looks like the left side
of that bot
is no longer working.

40:21.420 --> 40:24.921
[chris] that last exchange,
it may have put both these
bots on the ropes.

40:24.923 --> 40:27.957
You've gotta show us movement,
ray.

40:27.959 --> 40:30.994
Mammoth and tombstone
are crab walking now.

40:30.996 --> 40:33.630
Could we actually
have a countdown coming?

40:34.733 --> 40:37.333
We've got a simultaneous
incapacitation.

40:37.335 --> 40:39.369
They've simultaneously
incapacitated.

40:39.371 --> 40:41.638
In ten, nine...

40:41.640 --> 40:44.574
[chris] and now the referee
counting out both teams.

40:45.677 --> 40:46.910
Wow!

40:46.912 --> 40:48.645
I'm pretty sure
we're both down.

40:48.647 --> 40:52.182
An unbelievable turn
of events here tonight.

40:52.184 --> 40:54.250
-Knockout!
-Knockout!

40:56.321 --> 40:58.121
[chris] that's gonna be it.

40:58.123 --> 41:02.992
The refs have declared
a simultaneous incapacitation.

41:02.994 --> 41:07.197
Kenny, what the heck
just happened here?

41:07.199 --> 41:12.035
Well, a simultaneous
incapacitation is kind of
like a double knockout.

41:12.037 --> 41:15.171
[kenny] so this should go
to the judge's scorecard.

41:15.173 --> 41:21.077
Guys, we observe both bots
being incapacitated
at the same time.

41:21.079 --> 41:22.312
So we're going to the judges.

41:22.314 --> 41:23.279
-Okay.
-Okay.

41:23.281 --> 41:24.614
Thank you, gentlemen.

41:25.684 --> 41:29.285
[chris] okay, so there it is.

41:29.287 --> 41:34.090
Kenny, after tombstone
launched its all-out nuclear
attack out of the gate,

41:34.092 --> 41:36.659
both robots ended up
seeing stars

41:36.661 --> 41:39.796
and the teams were counted out
simultaneously.

41:39.798 --> 41:42.999
So, break this crazy
fight down for us.

41:43.001 --> 41:45.635
[kenny] well, it was that
gigantic third exchange

41:45.637 --> 41:48.638
that sent both bots
flying across the box.

41:48.640 --> 41:51.241
Mammoth lost a wheel
and I thought
the fight was over,

41:51.243 --> 41:54.010
but the recoil
also sent tombstone

41:54.012 --> 41:55.879
crashing into the arena wall

41:55.881 --> 41:58.648
and then its left side
stopped working.

41:58.650 --> 42:02.252
[chris] and how are the judges
looking at this type
of double knockout?

42:02.254 --> 42:05.555
[kenny] well, they'll score it
like they would
any other decision.

42:05.557 --> 42:09.425
Mammoth will tally
a few aggression points
for continuing to attack.

42:09.427 --> 42:11.127
But at the end of the day,

42:11.129 --> 42:13.630
damage is the most heavily
weighted category

42:13.632 --> 42:15.064
and tombstone proved

42:15.066 --> 42:18.768
that the king
of kinetic energy title
is still very fitting.

42:18.770 --> 42:21.337
[chris] let's throw it over to
faruq.

42:23.308 --> 42:26.242
The results
from the judges are in.

42:29.981 --> 42:33.650
The winner by a unanimous
decision is...

42:39.090 --> 42:42.025
Tombstone!

42:44.095 --> 42:45.461
Yeah, baby!

42:45.463 --> 42:48.164
That was good. That was good.

42:53.405 --> 42:55.238
-Ray.
-We're back, baby.

42:55.240 --> 42:56.673
That's right, that's right.

42:56.675 --> 43:01.210
Ray, congratulations on your
simultaneous incapacitation.

43:01.212 --> 43:04.714
Hey, I got to make it
exciting, I guess, you know.

43:04.716 --> 43:08.051
You're all smiles right now,
but you had your game face on.

43:08.053 --> 43:12.021
Well, yeah, I had to win
this match
going into this 0-1,

43:12.023 --> 43:13.323
I mean we're here to win
the giant nut,

43:13.325 --> 43:15.325
we're not here to pack up
and go home.

43:15.327 --> 43:18.428
So I needed to win this match
to get into the tree of 32.

43:18.430 --> 43:21.664
All right, ray,
congratulations on win
number one this season.

43:21.666 --> 43:23.499
Go celebrate with your family.

43:23.501 --> 43:26.135
Absolutely.
We're going to do that.
Absolutely.

43:32.310 --> 43:34.243
[chris] you know, there was an
awful lot of chirping

43:34.245 --> 43:36.446
about how tombstone
may have lost a step

43:36.448 --> 43:40.917
after ray dropped his opener
to captain shrederator.

43:40.919 --> 43:42.919
He ain't finished in 2021,
bro.

43:42.921 --> 43:43.987
Yeah, absolutely.

43:43.989 --> 43:45.488
I mean he has that
knockout power.

43:45.490 --> 43:48.958
He only needs to be perfect
for like a quarter
of a second.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.927
That is amazing.

43:50.929 --> 43:55.031
Simultaneous incapacitation.
Why not?

43:55.867 --> 43:56.966
Okay.

43:57.002 --> 44:01.004
Coming up, the most fearsome
flipper in all of canada,

44:01.006 --> 44:07.443
lucky will try to put tantrum
in some serious need
of universal healthcare.

44:07.445 --> 44:12.115
You'll see that fight
<i> when we return on battlebots.</i>

44:20.859 --> 44:22.425
<i> We are back on battlebots.</i>

44:22.427 --> 44:26.029
We got a good one cooking
for you as tantrum
is inside the box

44:26.031 --> 44:27.897
for the second time
this season,

44:27.899 --> 44:30.900
now captained
by ginger schmidt
and alex grant

44:30.902 --> 44:33.169
taking over for aren hill.

44:33.171 --> 44:36.072
Tantrum first time out
won a decision.

44:36.074 --> 44:37.373
Very impressive.

44:37.375 --> 44:39.409
This thing is built
like a brick
and it's got a punch as well.

44:39.411 --> 44:42.111
[kenny] yeah, that's right.
Semi-finalist
from last season.

44:42.113 --> 44:44.280
I believe they're a better bot
this season.

44:44.282 --> 44:48.351
Extremely durable,
very powerful and defensively
they are so set.

44:48.353 --> 44:52.588
And for the first time
this season we say hello
to lucky from canada,

44:52.590 --> 44:55.958
engineered by all around
nice guy mark demers.

44:55.960 --> 45:00.263
This old-school
pneumatic flipper has been
trying to flip itself

45:00.265 --> 45:02.832
out of the middle
of the pack
for quite a while now.

45:02.834 --> 45:04.967
It's built pretty much
like a tank

45:04.969 --> 45:08.638
and that durability
has led it to force
judges' decisions

45:08.640 --> 45:11.074
in more than half
of its battlebots matches.

45:11.076 --> 45:13.009
So it's no tomato can, kenny.

45:13.011 --> 45:16.179
[kenny] yeah, and this year
mark says he's brought a
secret weapon.

45:16.181 --> 45:20.149
He's decided to turn
over the driving reins
to matt olson,

45:20.151 --> 45:24.654
one of the top ranked
dirt track rc drivers
in the world.

45:24.656 --> 45:27.824
Mark said his new wheelman
has better fine motor skills

45:27.826 --> 45:32.228
and more precision
on the sticks
than anyone he's ever seen.

45:32.230 --> 45:35.798
We know all too well
that a great driver can make
or break any fight.

45:35.800 --> 45:37.533
Let's see how he does.

45:37.535 --> 45:39.869
I think this could be
a good, good fight.

45:39.871 --> 45:42.138
Let's check it out. Faruq.

45:45.009 --> 45:48.978
[faruq] in the red square
from ottawa, canada.

45:48.980 --> 45:52.148
Come on seven, papa needs
a new pair of shoes.

45:52.150 --> 45:55.118
It's lucky!

45:59.657 --> 46:03.726
[chris] canada's own lucky,
captained by mark demers

46:03.728 --> 46:08.297
and there's his new driving
protege, matt olson.

46:08.299 --> 46:10.867
[kenny] yeah, and let's not
forget that mark introduced us

46:10.869 --> 46:13.970
to one of the most sensational
drivers in the sport,

46:13.972 --> 46:15.938
gary gin, back in season two.

46:15.940 --> 46:19.008
So he definitely has a knack
for sniffing out talent.

46:19.010 --> 46:23.513
Let's see
how the rookie driver matt
handles the big time.

46:25.316 --> 46:30.353
In the blue square,
it's got fist of rage
to split your face.

46:30.355 --> 46:33.589
Give it up for tantrum!

46:37.295 --> 46:41.998
[chris] listen to the crowd
welcome the fist of fury,
tantrum,

46:42.000 --> 46:44.934
coming off a decision win
over malice.

46:44.936 --> 46:47.804
This team is just
oozing confidence.

46:47.806 --> 46:50.106
So, kenny,
what's their ceiling
this year?

46:50.108 --> 46:51.908
[kenny] look, they've gone
from clunky rookie

46:51.910 --> 46:55.745
to polished semifinalist
in the span of three seasons.

46:55.747 --> 46:58.047
And after the smackdown
they put on malice,

46:58.049 --> 47:00.082
I don't think there's any
reason to doubt

47:00.084 --> 47:03.519
they could contend
for a top four spot again.

47:03.521 --> 47:05.688
But experienced teams
know not to get
ahead of themselves.

47:05.690 --> 47:10.259
In the fight game,
you got to take it
one match at a time.

47:11.996 --> 47:15.198
Lucky's a flipper robot,
so we don't want them to get
under us.

47:15.200 --> 47:18.868
In order to avoid this,
we're introducing
our minibot nugget.

47:18.870 --> 47:20.870
Nugget is gonna drive
around the sides of lucky

47:20.872 --> 47:23.072
while we're distracting them
from the front,

47:23.074 --> 47:26.242
it's gonna high center
lucky by getting
all the way underneath

47:26.244 --> 47:28.211
and bringing lucky
up off the floor,

47:28.213 --> 47:30.780
so its wheels can't touch
the bottom of the box.

47:30.782 --> 47:32.415
And then when lucky
is high centered,

47:32.417 --> 47:34.984
tantrum's gonna come in
and give them a big punch.

47:34.986 --> 47:36.519
This year we have
that upper deck.

47:36.521 --> 47:37.987
If you look at the way
lucky's configured,

47:37.989 --> 47:40.056
we're a flipper,

47:40.058 --> 47:45.061
but our configuration tends
to go at a certain height
and throw at a distance.

47:45.063 --> 47:47.964
So we go about
as far forward as we do high.

47:47.966 --> 47:50.399
And I think the...
The change in the design

47:50.401 --> 47:53.803
with the upper deck
benefits lucky
more than any other machine.

47:53.805 --> 47:55.571
We look to deliver on that.

47:59.043 --> 48:01.410
<i> [bot] robots activate.</i>

48:02.914 --> 48:06.716
[chris] and kenny, these two
teams actually have a little
bit of history.

48:06.718 --> 48:07.783
[kenny] yeah, that's right.

48:07.785 --> 48:10.820
They did meet in an exhibition
match back in 2019.

48:10.822 --> 48:13.956
Tantrum was far
from the top tier bot
it is today,

48:13.958 --> 48:16.826
but lucky was able to get low
ground and flip them.

48:16.828 --> 48:20.930
And it took a judge's decision
for tantrum to score a win.

48:20.932 --> 48:24.500
[chris] well, let's see if
lucky can replicate some of
that action here tonight.

48:36.948 --> 48:39.482
Fight! Fight! Fight!

48:39.484 --> 48:40.816
Let's go, tantrum.

48:40.818 --> 48:42.818
Tantrum.

48:42.820 --> 48:45.454
Fight! Fight! Fight!

48:45.456 --> 48:48.491
Fight! Fight! Fight!

48:48.493 --> 48:50.960
[chris] let the bot battle
begin.

48:51.362 --> 48:53.329
Tantrum quick on the draw.

48:54.799 --> 48:56.332
Wow!

48:57.235 --> 48:59.869
Lucky all over tantrum
at the start.

48:59.871 --> 49:02.305
And there's another flip.

49:02.307 --> 49:04.874
[kenny] the canadians are not
messing around, chris.

49:04.876 --> 49:07.109
[chris] oh, look at tantrum.

49:07.111 --> 49:10.246
And tantrum might be
stuck on the rail.

49:10.248 --> 49:11.213
Uh-oh.

49:11.215 --> 49:12.982
Oh.

49:12.984 --> 49:15.451
It gave a little help
but a flip as well.

49:15.453 --> 49:19.055
Wow, the rookie driver
actually wants to keep
the fight going.

49:19.891 --> 49:22.825
Uh-oh.
The nose is bent on lucky.

49:22.827 --> 49:24.794
Look at that.
It's pushed back, kenny.

49:24.796 --> 49:26.362
[kenny] up in there, brother.

49:26.364 --> 49:30.166
[chris] tantrum now starting
to work lucky right in front
of us.

49:30.168 --> 49:31.300
Uh-oh!

49:33.705 --> 49:36.806
[kenny] wow, look at that jump
right there from lucky.

49:36.808 --> 49:39.642
[chris] hey, it popped off
the floor like bruce lee.

49:39.644 --> 49:41.344
Tantrum turning it on now,

49:41.346 --> 49:45.781
getting underneath lucky
pretty much at will.

49:45.783 --> 49:48.150
[kenny] it stripped off a
couple of wheels, chris.

49:49.120 --> 49:51.287
[chris] what a comeback by
tantrum.

49:51.289 --> 49:52.822
This is a good one so far.

49:52.824 --> 49:57.827
It's lucky is starting
to come apart piece by piece
and tire by tire.

49:57.829 --> 50:01.030
Yeah, early on it was lucky
getting some great flips.

50:01.032 --> 50:02.832
Now getting underneath
[inaudible]

50:02.834 --> 50:04.133
and they are picking him
apart.

50:04.135 --> 50:08.037
Lucky is down to one tire
in the back.

50:08.039 --> 50:10.006
-Can it move?
-[kenny] oh, boy.

50:10.008 --> 50:11.941
[chris] oh, it's quivering for
life.

50:11.943 --> 50:13.609
You gotta show me you got it.

50:13.611 --> 50:17.480
[kenny] lucky were so dominant
at the start but it's about
to get counted out, chris.

50:18.883 --> 50:20.649
The ref is issuing a warning.

50:20.651 --> 50:22.351
Ten, nine...

50:22.353 --> 50:29.158
The bot from ottawa, canada,
looks like it needs an iv
and the countdown has started.

50:29.160 --> 50:33.262
Tantrum comes from behind
and gets the ko.

50:33.264 --> 50:35.064
Knockout!

50:39.270 --> 50:41.237
-I got it at the beginning.
-Yeah.

50:41.239 --> 50:44.140
Hey, kickass shot guys.
That was awesome.

50:48.913 --> 50:50.513
[chris] kenny, I gotta be
honest,

50:50.848 --> 50:54.517
I'm not so sure that team
lucky could have scripted
a better start to this fight.

50:54.519 --> 50:56.085
[kenny] this was an awesome
fight.

50:56.087 --> 50:59.789
They were able to get
underneath tantrum repeatedly
to start this fight,

50:59.791 --> 51:03.059
they were aggressive,
they were taking the fight
right to him.

51:03.061 --> 51:05.294
And this is exactly
what mark wanted here.

51:05.296 --> 51:07.063
So, hard to beat this start,

51:07.065 --> 51:10.232
but then once tantrum
got off the rail

51:10.234 --> 51:11.934
and they definitely
helped him out there,

51:11.936 --> 51:15.004
but tantrum just went to work,
got serious and said,

51:15.006 --> 51:17.973
"all right, we're in this
and we're here
to knock you out."

51:17.975 --> 51:19.875
[chris] tantrum went after the
tires

51:19.877 --> 51:24.080
and at that point
even with all the athleticism
that lucky showed

51:24.082 --> 51:26.515
throughout the evening,
he was just a sitting duck.

51:26.517 --> 51:28.150
[kenny] no question about it.

51:28.152 --> 51:30.386
And I think there's a lot
of positives for lucky
to take away from this fight.

51:30.388 --> 51:32.221
They showed
some good durability

51:32.223 --> 51:34.557
but they were susceptible
there to the tires.

51:34.559 --> 51:36.625
And I think
that was the difference.

51:36.627 --> 51:41.997
[chris] and here once again
the finishing blow as tantrum
does in lucky for the evening.

51:43.935 --> 51:46.168
Alex and ginger.

51:46.170 --> 51:47.870
We did it, we did it!

51:47.872 --> 51:50.639
Ginger. Alex.

51:50.641 --> 51:53.843
Were you guys a little nervous
when you had that start

51:53.845 --> 51:56.011
because it seemed like you
guys were getting flipped?

51:56.013 --> 51:58.447
Yeah, we knew lucky
was a strong flipper,

51:58.449 --> 52:01.183
and with flippers
you never know
what's gonna happen.

52:01.185 --> 52:03.152
So they had us there
in the first half.

52:03.154 --> 52:06.222
But we had an amazing driving
from dillon and bryan,

52:06.224 --> 52:07.323
our drivers,

52:07.325 --> 52:09.892
and we got them
in the second half,
no problem.

52:09.894 --> 52:13.629
Alex, how destructive
is your bot?

52:15.133 --> 52:18.167
Tantrum last year
had very few good hits.

52:18.169 --> 52:21.036
We're seeing more great hits
in these last two fights

52:21.038 --> 52:23.906
than the whole season,
like, last year combined.

52:23.908 --> 52:25.207
We are ready for the finals.

52:25.209 --> 52:26.876
We're ready
for the round of 32.

52:26.878 --> 52:28.110
We're going all the way.

52:31.215 --> 52:32.481
All right.

52:32.650 --> 52:35.918
Ginger, alex, congratulations,
off to a 2-0 start
this season.

52:35.920 --> 52:37.586
-Thank you.
-See you later.

52:44.896 --> 52:46.896
-Awesome fight, guys.
-Great job.

52:46.898 --> 52:47.997
It was so fun.

52:47.999 --> 52:50.332
You got us real
scared at the beginning.

52:50.334 --> 52:52.635
[chris] now, I'm no fortune
teller

52:52.637 --> 52:55.871
but, kenny, something tells
me tantrum gets counted out

52:55.873 --> 52:59.074
if lucky doesn't give a little
helping nudge there.

53:00.278 --> 53:03.979
Listen, it's possible,
you never know.

53:03.981 --> 53:05.414
You can't really see
into the future that well.

53:05.416 --> 53:07.016
It seemed like
it wasn't moving.

53:07.018 --> 53:08.651
It was kind of
at the perfect angle.

53:08.653 --> 53:11.253
But give props
to the rookie driver

53:11.255 --> 53:13.856
for keeping the fight
going even

53:13.858 --> 53:16.358
if it may have cost
lucky the victory.

53:16.961 --> 53:18.160
[chris] coming up next,

53:18.162 --> 53:21.096
battlebots og ghost raptor

53:21.098 --> 53:23.666
welcomes the rookies
from team glitch

53:23.668 --> 53:27.069
to the most deadly robot
competition on earth.

53:27.071 --> 53:28.504
Stay tuned.

53:37.048 --> 53:38.981
<i> We are back on battlebots</i>

53:38.983 --> 53:41.450
and it has been
a scintillating night

53:41.452 --> 53:44.820
of qualifying action here
in las vegas.

53:44.822 --> 53:47.056
Coming up next,
you'll see ghost raptor

53:47.058 --> 53:50.526
welcome battlebots' rookie
glitch to the big leagues.

53:50.528 --> 53:55.598
And later tonight, madman
martin mason and mad catter

53:55.600 --> 54:00.302
will try to sink their fangs
into jamison go in the fire
breathing sawblaze.

54:00.304 --> 54:04.440
Let's take a peek
behind the curtain
at tonight's main event.

54:07.111 --> 54:10.646
[commentator]
huge strike right there
from sawblaze.

54:10.648 --> 54:12.581
That opened up a can of fire!

54:12.583 --> 54:14.917
In our first fight
we fought minotaur.

54:14.919 --> 54:19.088
[commentator]
look at this, taking minotaur,
putting him on the upper deck!

54:19.890 --> 54:21.123
It went really well for us.

54:21.125 --> 54:23.192
[commentator]
this is unbelievable.

54:23.194 --> 54:27.196
[commentator 2] this is just
a master class here
from jamison go right now.

54:27.198 --> 54:30.933
It feels amazing to take down
such a legendary robot
in our first fight.

54:32.970 --> 54:34.370
And now we're taking
on mad catter.

54:34.372 --> 54:39.008
[faruq] it's mad catter.

54:39.010 --> 54:42.645
[commentator] the lunatic
fringe of robot combat.

54:49.520 --> 54:51.353
Let me tell you
about that last fight.

54:52.390 --> 54:53.889
We drove hard.

54:53.891 --> 54:55.391
[commentator] oh.

54:55.393 --> 54:56.959
We hit hard.

54:56.961 --> 54:59.261
[commentator] mad catter
is picking yeti apart.

54:59.263 --> 55:02.164
And before you know it,
it was all over.

55:02.166 --> 55:03.799
[commentator]
yeti is finished.

55:03.801 --> 55:06.669
Martin mason
gets the job done.

55:06.671 --> 55:08.837
You had to cart him
out of the arena.

55:08.839 --> 55:11.540
They should just start
bringing stretchers
to all our fights.

55:16.080 --> 55:17.246
Against mad catter,

55:17.281 --> 55:19.648
we're gonna use
the same setup we used
against minotaur.

55:19.650 --> 55:21.083
Our long fork's on the end,

55:21.085 --> 55:23.986
so we can get underneath them
as soon as possible

55:23.988 --> 55:26.188
or to dissuade their weapon
from a long distance.

55:26.190 --> 55:29.658
[commentator]
here comes sawblaze
on the counterattack.

55:29.660 --> 55:32.461
To combat their configuration,
we're gonna have
to stay nimble.

55:32.463 --> 55:34.129
We don't wanna get
hit by that disc.

55:34.131 --> 55:36.098
But we also have to look out
for their wedges.

55:36.100 --> 55:38.267
[commentator] massive hit
there by mad catter.

55:38.269 --> 55:40.602
This time we're putting
on a brand new blade.

55:40.604 --> 55:43.405
We're going to christen
its teeth on their chassis.

55:45.976 --> 55:47.976
Let me tell you a little bit
about our strategy.

55:47.978 --> 55:50.245
We're running our lightest
weapon, french fry.

55:50.247 --> 55:52.981
It still hits incredibly hard.

55:52.983 --> 55:54.416
Oh!

55:54.418 --> 55:56.418
[commentator 2]
what a hit by mad catter!

55:56.420 --> 55:58.420
It lets us stay in control.

55:58.422 --> 56:01.123
And that's what this is gonna
be all about, control.

56:01.125 --> 56:02.758
Oh, yeah.

56:02.760 --> 56:06.228
Sawblaze is a big fat robot.

56:06.230 --> 56:08.964
It's hard to get around
but if you do,

56:08.966 --> 56:13.936
delicious tires waiting
for a little tickle
from mad catter.

56:13.938 --> 56:16.972
[commentator 2]
and, oh, another big shot.

56:20.077 --> 56:22.611
They say there's more than
one way to skin a cat.

56:25.082 --> 56:26.482
Well, we've got two.

56:28.018 --> 56:31.720
Slash and burn.

56:31.722 --> 56:35.224
Mad catter,
we're coming for you.

56:40.197 --> 56:42.398
You know what, chris,
let me tell you something,

56:42.400 --> 56:45.000
let me tell you something
about matt catter, okay.

56:45.002 --> 56:46.802
Let me tell you...

56:46.804 --> 56:48.203
Are you cutting your promo
right here?

56:48.205 --> 56:50.272
Sorry, I just got into his...
Yeah.

56:50.274 --> 56:53.976
[chris] do not miss that
insane matchup, folks.

56:53.978 --> 56:58.847
That's tonight's main event
and it is just around
the corner.

56:58.849 --> 57:01.750
But right now
it's rookie glitch

57:01.752 --> 57:06.088
squaring off
with ghost raptor,
captained by chuck pitzer.

57:07.391 --> 57:11.059
A battlebots' og,
chuck made a name for himself

57:11.061 --> 57:13.162
when an upset win
over ice wave

57:13.164 --> 57:18.233
sent him to the semifinals
all the way back in 2015.

57:18.235 --> 57:23.038
And guess what, he's been
chasing the dragon ever since.

57:23.040 --> 57:25.841
[kenny] no doubt chuck has
been at this game for a long
time

57:25.843 --> 57:28.877
and he's looking to edge
a few more meaningful fights

57:28.879 --> 57:32.047
into the battlebots history
books with ghost raptor.

57:32.049 --> 57:33.949
Chuck's an excellent builder.

57:33.951 --> 57:36.318
Let's see if he's got
a few more left in.

57:36.320 --> 57:38.654
He's taking on a rookie robot
named glitch

57:38.656 --> 57:40.255
engineered by kyle miller.

57:40.257 --> 57:42.324
Kyle's a 19-year-old
college student

57:42.326 --> 57:44.827
who was still coloring outside
the lines

57:44.829 --> 57:46.195
when chuck
was blazing his path

57:46.197 --> 57:49.364
in combat robotics
all those years ago.

57:49.366 --> 57:52.401
[kenny] kyle is definitely
representing a new generation
of builders

57:52.403 --> 57:54.670
and a new
generation of robots.

57:54.672 --> 57:56.505
Glitch is an incredibly sleek,

57:56.507 --> 57:59.908
ground scraping bot
that features
an omni wheel drive

57:59.910 --> 58:01.410
similar to shatter's

58:01.412 --> 58:04.780
that should allow it
to counteract
that gyroscopic effect

58:04.782 --> 58:06.915
of its massive
eggbeater weapon.

58:06.917 --> 58:08.817
Can't wait to see
how it does here.

58:08.819 --> 58:10.152
[chris] and how about this,

58:10.154 --> 58:14.256
just moments ago our cameras
caught a panicked team glitch

58:14.258 --> 58:16.892
trying to pull a stuck
screw out of their frame

58:16.894 --> 58:19.094
while they were changing
configurations.

58:19.096 --> 58:22.097
The team was actually
in jeopardy
of missing the match.

58:22.099 --> 58:24.066
But who stepped in to help?

58:24.068 --> 58:28.237
None other than the veteran
chuck pitzer
from ghost raptor.

58:28.239 --> 58:30.639
The man wanted to fight,
what can you say?

58:30.641 --> 58:33.642
Now we're being told
the rookie is ready to rock.

58:33.644 --> 58:36.512
Let's see what you got. Faruq.

58:38.716 --> 58:43.051
In the red square
from san jose, california,

58:43.053 --> 58:48.991
the most dangerous raptor
since vince carter,
it's ghost raptor.

58:52.429 --> 58:54.863
[chris] love it. Oh, look him.

58:54.865 --> 58:56.331
Pitzer with the mohawk.

58:56.333 --> 58:57.933
-[chris] yes.
-[kenny] wow.

58:57.935 --> 59:00.002
[chris] yes, the front man.

59:00.004 --> 59:01.169
[kenny] I love it.

59:01.171 --> 59:02.371
[chris] I don't care about the
robot.

59:02.373 --> 59:05.641
I can't wait to see
what's on the b side
of the album.

59:05.643 --> 59:06.942
[kenny] wow, look at that.

59:06.944 --> 59:10.712
And his bot has a few new
upgrades this year as well.

59:10.714 --> 59:12.948
The housing
is entirely custom.

59:12.950 --> 59:18.086
They added fire
and chuck says it's running
better than ever.

59:20.357 --> 59:24.426
In the blue square
from berkeley, california,

59:24.428 --> 59:28.330
he came from a college town
to beat you down.

59:28.332 --> 59:31.033
It's glitch!

59:35.372 --> 59:36.905
[chris] so after a bit of a
scare,

59:36.907 --> 59:40.008
kyle miller and glitch
make their way to the box

59:40.010 --> 59:44.212
with a huge sigh of relief
and an even bigger weapon.

59:44.214 --> 59:47.149
[kenny] yeah, that 58-pound
eggbeater drum

59:47.151 --> 59:52.120
can reach the maximum allowed
250 miles per hour tip speed,

59:52.122 --> 59:55.123
which means it should pack
a serious punch.

59:55.125 --> 59:57.059
They've been testing it
repeatedly.

59:57.061 --> 59:58.694
But I can't say it enough,

59:58.696 --> 1:00:00.362
you just don't know
how your robot

1:00:00.364 --> 1:00:04.266
is going to perform
until you step inside
the battle box.

1:00:07.338 --> 1:00:09.004
We're fighting glitch.

1:00:09.006 --> 1:00:12.140
It doesn't seem like
a really intimidating robot.

1:00:12.142 --> 1:00:16.311
I think it's such a big robot
that we can maneuver
around it.

1:00:16.313 --> 1:00:18.447
Their bite area
is kind of limited,

1:00:18.449 --> 1:00:20.082
you have to be
right up into it

1:00:20.084 --> 1:00:22.384
to be able to get bit
by their big drum spinner.

1:00:22.386 --> 1:00:24.853
And if they have that wide
of a surface area,

1:00:24.855 --> 1:00:27.122
it's gonna be tough for them
to get in on me.

1:00:27.124 --> 1:00:30.025
Ghost raptor spins
in a counterclockwise
direction.

1:00:30.027 --> 1:00:32.928
What we want to do
is hit our weapon

1:00:32.930 --> 1:00:36.064
right into their main
middle assembly.

1:00:36.066 --> 1:00:40.068
Hopefully that will be able
to pop their weapon
or break their weapon hinge.

1:00:40.070 --> 1:00:44.406
I think there'll be great
hits, big sparks, boom.

1:00:48.746 --> 1:00:50.946
<i> [bot] robots activate.</i>

1:00:53.984 --> 1:00:57.953
[chris] chuck pitzer desperate
to start his season
with a victory

1:00:57.955 --> 1:01:00.922
facing off against a rookie
team of college kids

1:01:00.924 --> 1:01:03.325
trying to make a name
for themselves.

1:01:03.327 --> 1:01:08.363
The fights
<i> when battlebots continues.</i>

1:01:16.106 --> 1:01:19.808
We are right back
in the action here
<i> on battlebots</i>

1:01:19.810 --> 1:01:25.414
where veteran chuck pitzer
is ready to welcome
19-year-old rookie kyle miller

1:01:25.416 --> 1:01:27.849
and the rest of his team
to the big leagues.

1:01:27.851 --> 1:01:31.386
It's ghost raptor
versus glitch right now.

1:01:42.199 --> 1:01:48.070
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

1:01:48.072 --> 1:01:52.774
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

1:01:52.776 --> 1:01:56.111
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

1:01:56.113 --> 1:01:57.879
[chris]
let the bot battle begin!

1:01:57.881 --> 1:01:59.214
Glitch on the attack.

1:01:59.216 --> 1:02:02.017
Spinning up
that eggbeater drum.

1:02:02.019 --> 1:02:07.222
Hovering around ghost raptor,
those omni wheels lining up
at an angle to attack.

1:02:08.258 --> 1:02:10.759
Oh, it lands a shot.

1:02:10.761 --> 1:02:14.262
Able to get underneath
ghost raptor there.

1:02:14.264 --> 1:02:16.932
[kenny] you can see
how excited team glitch is

1:02:16.934 --> 1:02:19.201
for their first taste
of battlebots.

1:02:19.203 --> 1:02:22.137
Ghost raptor has got glitch
near the upper deck.

1:02:23.040 --> 1:02:24.239
Oh, man.

1:02:24.308 --> 1:02:27.042
[kenny] chuck pitzer had
glitch right where he wanted
it,

1:02:27.044 --> 1:02:29.745
but this time the lift
and dropped his weapon

1:02:29.747 --> 1:02:31.646
right into that
eggbeater drum.

1:02:33.083 --> 1:02:37.185
[chris] and ghost raptor's
spinner does not seem to be
working, kenny.

1:02:37.187 --> 1:02:40.889
[kenny] yeah, it may be all
lifter for ghost raptor
from here on out.

1:02:40.891 --> 1:02:43.825
But now glitch looks
a little punch struck, chris.

1:02:43.827 --> 1:02:45.894
That weapon
is clearly working okay

1:02:45.896 --> 1:02:48.563
but they are having
some control issues.

1:02:50.134 --> 1:02:52.300
[chris] yeah, it sure looks
like glitch is having drive
issues

1:02:52.302 --> 1:02:53.702
and now they're caught
in the corner.

1:02:53.704 --> 1:02:56.471
But as long as that weapon
continues to work,

1:02:56.473 --> 1:02:59.307
I don't think they mind
that ghost raptor's doing
a lot of the heavy lifting.

1:02:59.309 --> 1:03:00.609
Can you move?

1:03:00.611 --> 1:03:03.345
It's not moving,
I'm just moving away.

1:03:03.347 --> 1:03:06.548
[kenny] but it looks like
glitch may be stuck on the
rail now.

1:03:07.050 --> 1:03:08.383
[chris] oh, no.

1:03:08.418 --> 1:03:11.186
Okay, I'm gonna have
to count you out if you
can't get control.

1:03:11.188 --> 1:03:12.854
[kenny] that bot is so low
to the ground,

1:03:12.856 --> 1:03:16.625
it's wedged itself
underneath the wall.

1:03:16.627 --> 1:03:20.562
[chris] and how about this,
ghost raptor frees the rookie.

1:03:20.564 --> 1:03:21.930
You've gotta to do something,
chuck.

1:03:21.932 --> 1:03:24.299
[chris] so chuck pitzer helps
the team get ready for the
fight

1:03:24.301 --> 1:03:27.636
and then unsticks them here
during the match.

1:03:27.638 --> 1:03:30.305
[kenny] this guy's karma
is through the roof, chris.

1:03:30.307 --> 1:03:34.843
[chris] but here's ghost
raptor slamming glitch into
the wall.

1:03:34.845 --> 1:03:36.378
Honeymoon is definitely
over, folks,

1:03:36.380 --> 1:03:39.047
and the fight is back on.

1:03:39.049 --> 1:03:40.715
Ghost raptor, keep in mind,

1:03:40.717 --> 1:03:42.951
it is without
its primary weapon.

1:03:42.953 --> 1:03:47.122
Glitch's eggbeater drum
however still going strong,
kenny.

1:03:47.124 --> 1:03:50.192
[kenny] but needs to get
some more offense going
for the judges, chris.

1:03:50.194 --> 1:03:52.093
[chris] absolutely.

1:03:52.095 --> 1:03:54.062
As for ghost raptor,
a question here.

1:03:54.064 --> 1:03:58.066
Can it find a way
to take advantage of glitch's
lack of control here?

1:03:58.068 --> 1:04:00.035
Maybe get
that lifter involved,

1:04:00.037 --> 1:04:03.238
maybe flip the rookie,
glitch's all over the place.

1:04:03.240 --> 1:04:06.641
[kenny] glitch having some
steering issues out there

1:04:06.643 --> 1:04:09.077
and not sure those omni wheels
are working the way
they want it.

1:04:09.079 --> 1:04:10.979
[chris] okay, under a minute
to go.

1:04:10.981 --> 1:04:13.381
And despite the loss
of that primary weapon,

1:04:13.383 --> 1:04:16.852
ghost raptor's still very much
alive in this fight,

1:04:16.854 --> 1:04:18.954
it continues to engage.

1:04:19.423 --> 1:04:21.556
That's a good shot again
by glitch.

1:04:21.558 --> 1:04:23.225
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:04:23.227 --> 1:04:27.062
[chris] ghost raptor though
has no problem working
its way back over.

1:04:27.064 --> 1:04:30.398
[kenny] glitch looking like
it's frozen solid now though,
chris.

1:04:30.400 --> 1:04:33.034
The rookies may be in trouble.

1:04:33.036 --> 1:04:35.570
Ghost raptor probing
for signs of life.

1:04:35.572 --> 1:04:36.872
-Uh-oh.
-Oh.

1:04:36.874 --> 1:04:37.606
Uh-oh.

1:04:37.608 --> 1:04:40.609
-Oh, nice.
-Big hit.

1:04:40.611 --> 1:04:44.913
[chris] best sequence--
and oh, some things have
come apart on ghost raptor.

1:04:44.915 --> 1:04:48.683
[kenny] glitch just
rose from the dead, chris,
and it looks angry.

1:04:49.920 --> 1:04:53.121
I'm not sure ghost raptor
knows what hit it.

1:04:53.123 --> 1:04:57.125
Glitch starting to find
its training wheels.

1:04:57.127 --> 1:05:00.996
Under ten to go.
It'll go the distance.

1:05:00.998 --> 1:05:04.666
Can glitch lay down
one more shot
to impress the judges?

1:05:09.006 --> 1:05:13.341
[chris] and this one will
indeed go to the scorecard.

1:05:14.278 --> 1:05:17.245
Kenny, chuck pitzer
clearly wanted to fight

1:05:17.247 --> 1:05:21.082
but he made a costly unforced
error early in this match.

1:05:21.084 --> 1:05:22.217
[kenny] no doubt.

1:05:22.219 --> 1:05:24.886
Chuck had glitch pinned up
against the screws

1:05:24.888 --> 1:05:27.222
but mistimed this lift
right here

1:05:27.224 --> 1:05:28.757
and dropped his weapon

1:05:28.759 --> 1:05:31.426
directly into that deadly
eggbeater drum.

1:05:31.428 --> 1:05:34.262
[chris] that shot took out
ghost raptor's spinner

1:05:34.264 --> 1:05:36.298
and put it
behind the eight ball.

1:05:36.300 --> 1:05:40.302
But from that point on glitch
started, well, glitching.

1:05:40.304 --> 1:05:42.370
Yeah, glitch
was having major trouble

1:05:42.372 --> 1:05:46.041
with either its drive
or its omni wheels
throughout this fight.

1:05:46.043 --> 1:05:49.711
Ghost raptor even had to help
unstick it at one point.

1:05:49.713 --> 1:05:53.381
That lack of control is going
to cost it on the scorecards.

1:05:53.383 --> 1:05:57.018
[chris] but just when it
looked like glitch was ready
to throw in the towel,

1:05:57.020 --> 1:05:59.054
it sprang to life,

1:05:59.056 --> 1:06:04.025
landed a huge shot
and gave the judges something
to think about.

1:06:04.027 --> 1:06:06.761
Let's see how they break
this one down.

1:06:06.763 --> 1:06:08.096
Here's faruq.

1:06:09.166 --> 1:06:12.067
The results
from the judges are in.

1:06:17.975 --> 1:06:21.609
The winner by unanimous
decision is...

1:06:24.948 --> 1:06:26.214
Glitch!

1:06:46.203 --> 1:06:47.435
[chris] kyle.

1:06:52.376 --> 1:06:55.577
Hey, kyle, you can breathe
now, it's good.

1:06:55.579 --> 1:06:57.312
Not yet.

1:06:57.314 --> 1:07:01.383
How nervous were you
during the decision-making
process by the judges?

1:07:02.686 --> 1:07:03.918
Extremely nervous.

1:07:03.987 --> 1:07:06.755
Ghost raptor
had a lot of control
and a lot of aggression

1:07:06.757 --> 1:07:08.656
and they kept us
in this fight, to be honest.

1:07:08.658 --> 1:07:11.593
We had some ground
clearance issues
and they kept it going.

1:07:11.595 --> 1:07:13.762
So we're really grateful
for that.

1:07:13.764 --> 1:07:17.232
What was the strategy heading
into this fight
against ghost raptor?

1:07:17.234 --> 1:07:19.334
We just wanted to go
weapon on weapon,

1:07:19.336 --> 1:07:23.138
knock it out from the start
and luckily that worked.

1:07:23.140 --> 1:07:25.707
After that, we didn't really
have a plan.

1:07:25.709 --> 1:07:28.810
I just hit them
as much as possible.

1:07:28.812 --> 1:07:31.846
Kyle, were you more excited
with the way your weapon
performed

1:07:31.848 --> 1:07:34.949
or were you more disappointed
in the wheels?

1:07:34.951 --> 1:07:36.651
Definitely excited
about the weapon.

1:07:36.653 --> 1:07:38.219
The wheels, I think,
actually did great.

1:07:38.221 --> 1:07:40.655
It was more the wedges
getting stuck underneath.

1:07:40.657 --> 1:07:45.260
So once we grind that down,
we'll be like a lot better
for the next matches.

1:07:45.262 --> 1:07:48.163
All right.
Well, congratulations
on getting win number one

1:07:48.165 --> 1:07:49.898
in your battlebots career.

1:07:49.900 --> 1:07:51.299
Thank you.

1:07:57.040 --> 1:07:59.274
All right.
So kenny, if you're glitch,
you gotta be feeling great.

1:07:59.276 --> 1:08:01.042
I mean the robot
didn't run perfectly,

1:08:01.044 --> 1:08:03.044
but you will take
a win out of the box.

1:08:03.046 --> 1:08:05.847
[kenny]
yeah. And these guys were so
nervous before the fight.

1:08:05.849 --> 1:08:08.249
The fact they can get that new
technology out there
to go out there

1:08:08.251 --> 1:08:11.386
and do what it did
against the og of battlebots
is impressive.

1:08:11.388 --> 1:08:13.788
[chris] and by the way, chuck
pitzer,

1:08:13.790 --> 1:08:16.324
it's not always easy
to go over and say,

1:08:16.326 --> 1:08:18.359
"yeah, of course, I'm gonna
go help out my opponent."

1:08:18.361 --> 1:08:20.962
because you only have a few
matches to impress, you know,

1:08:20.964 --> 1:08:23.665
the selection committee
and make your stand.

1:08:23.667 --> 1:08:25.934
I think for him to do that
should really be applauded.

1:08:25.936 --> 1:08:27.335
Without a doubt.

1:08:27.337 --> 1:08:29.437
And listen, you know,
obviously he wanted
to get the win out there,

1:08:29.439 --> 1:08:32.807
but his other goals
was to go
the full three minutes

1:08:32.809 --> 1:08:34.175
and to have a fun fight.

1:08:34.177 --> 1:08:35.677
So he did that.
That was awesome.

1:08:35.679 --> 1:08:40.415
[chris] all right, coming up,
the moment
we've all been waiting for.

1:08:40.417 --> 1:08:45.353
Martin mason is ready to run
through a wall
to get this fight started.

1:08:45.355 --> 1:08:47.122
It's mad catter.

1:08:47.124 --> 1:08:48.790
It's sawblaze.

1:08:48.792 --> 1:08:51.426
Who will emerge
from the wreckage 2-0?

1:08:51.428 --> 1:08:54.229
It's the main event
and it's next.

1:08:58.235 --> 1:09:01.202
Martin mason
is the mad professor.

1:09:01.204 --> 1:09:03.171
You listen to your brother.

1:09:05.142 --> 1:09:08.943
I really wanted to know
if martin mason orders pizza
like that.

1:09:10.380 --> 1:09:12.614
You know what...
I'm not just a builder,

1:09:12.616 --> 1:09:16.751
I'm a teacher of physics
and engineering
at mt. San antonio college.

1:09:16.753 --> 1:09:19.921
<i> While I'm here at battlebots,</i>
<i> I'm still teaching my classes.</i>

1:09:19.923 --> 1:09:23.424
But when I got a fight
like today,
I gotta do it remote.

1:09:23.426 --> 1:09:25.693
Hey, folks, welcome
to class today.

1:09:25.695 --> 1:09:27.295
I'm so glad to see all of you.

1:09:27.297 --> 1:09:32.634
<i> My team here at battlebots</i>
<i> is made entirely of current</i>
<i> and past students.</i>

1:09:32.636 --> 1:09:35.003
The things I do here
give me an opportunity

1:09:35.005 --> 1:09:36.938
to bring them
some real world examples

1:09:36.940 --> 1:09:38.473
of what they're learning
in their physics class.

1:09:38.475 --> 1:09:39.841
Great job today, guys.

1:09:39.843 --> 1:09:41.276
You really nailed it in class.

1:09:41.278 --> 1:09:43.611
And I hope I can do that well
on the fight tonight.

1:09:46.249 --> 1:09:47.549
Yeah, pizza.

1:09:47.551 --> 1:09:51.719
Yeah, I need ten
large cheese pizzas delivered
<i> to battlebots</i>

1:09:51.721 --> 1:09:55.123
as soon as possible.
All right.

1:10:02.365 --> 1:10:07.302
<i> We are back on battlebots</i>
<i> in time right now for our</i>
<i> final event of the night.</i>

1:10:07.304 --> 1:10:08.670
And what a main event it is.

1:10:08.672 --> 1:10:11.139
A pair of bots
that are 1-0 so far.

1:10:11.141 --> 1:10:16.044
Sawblaze and mad catter
equally impressive
in their first round matchups.

1:10:16.046 --> 1:10:19.981
Jamison go had to go
the distance but took care
of minotaur.

1:10:19.983 --> 1:10:22.217
And when you talk to jamison,
it's very simple.

1:10:22.219 --> 1:10:25.420
If we don't win the giant nut
this year, we have failed.

1:10:25.422 --> 1:10:27.388
[kenny] I love that intensity.

1:10:27.390 --> 1:10:28.957
[chris] he's always like that.

1:10:28.959 --> 1:10:31.025
He's been like that
since day one.

1:10:31.027 --> 1:10:34.128
This is another bot
that continues to improve,
continues to get better.

1:10:34.130 --> 1:10:37.899
This is without a doubt
the best sawblaze
we've ever seen.

1:10:37.901 --> 1:10:39.801
And you know they'll have
to be at their best

1:10:39.803 --> 1:10:43.004
if they're going to take on
the nutty professor himself,

1:10:43.673 --> 1:10:46.975
martin mason and mad catter.

1:10:46.977 --> 1:10:49.911
What a performance
in its 2021 season opener.

1:10:49.913 --> 1:10:52.280
It knocked out one of the most
durable bots out there,

1:10:52.282 --> 1:10:55.383
one of the toughest bad boys
as well in yeti.

1:10:55.385 --> 1:10:58.987
Martin mason,
we love the shtick,
the pose to the camera,

1:10:58.989 --> 1:11:00.955
the whole wwe thing.

1:11:00.957 --> 1:11:02.056
This is a damn good bot, man.

1:11:02.058 --> 1:11:03.791
[kenny] I mean it's a great
bot.

1:11:03.793 --> 1:11:07.462
We keep being surprised
by how well-engineered
mad catter is.

1:11:07.464 --> 1:11:10.298
But it's time
to just accept the fact
that martin and his team

1:11:10.300 --> 1:11:13.434
have put together a contender
for the giant nut.

1:11:14.170 --> 1:11:16.070
[chris] and when you look
at the numbers,

1:11:16.072 --> 1:11:18.573
how do these two killer
machines compare, kenny?

1:11:18.575 --> 1:11:22.176
[kenny] well, you can see even
though mad catter is using
their smallest weapon,

1:11:22.178 --> 1:11:27.148
that disc still packs
a massive punch compared
to jamison's hammer saw.

1:11:27.150 --> 1:11:30.184
But one of the biggest
advantages sawblaze
has in this fight

1:11:30.186 --> 1:11:32.453
is its powerful drivetrain.

1:11:32.455 --> 1:11:35.757
To win, they're going to need
to dictate the pace

1:11:35.759 --> 1:11:38.660
of play and push mad catter
around the box.

1:11:38.662 --> 1:11:42.263
All that horsepower
should help them do that.

1:11:42.265 --> 1:11:43.364
Should be a ton of fun.

1:11:43.366 --> 1:11:45.466
Faruq, take it away.

1:11:50.907 --> 1:11:55.243
[faruq] ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready?

1:11:59.916 --> 1:12:05.053
It's time for the main event.

1:12:16.866 --> 1:12:18.766
In the red square,

1:12:18.768 --> 1:12:22.170
this bot's engineer
is a college dropout
like kanye.

1:12:22.172 --> 1:12:26.274
In the box, he's heartless
and cooks opponents
like entrees.

1:12:26.276 --> 1:12:29.877
Now he's watching the throne
and his ambitions are bigger.

1:12:29.879 --> 1:12:31.913
He won't settle
for silver or bronze.

1:12:31.915 --> 1:12:33.481
He's a gold digger.

1:12:33.483 --> 1:12:36.284
This bot is back
and he's in his prime.

1:12:36.286 --> 1:12:38.920
And yo, I'mma let you finish,

1:12:38.922 --> 1:12:41.889
but sawblaze is the greatest
robot of all time.

1:12:41.891 --> 1:12:45.593
Give it up for sawblaze!

1:12:50.033 --> 1:12:54.369
[chris] here comes team
sawblaze in their fifth
<i>  battlebots season.</i>

1:12:54.371 --> 1:12:57.004
Kenny, coming off
a convincing decision win

1:12:57.006 --> 1:13:00.942
over minotaur
in their first fight
of the year.

1:13:00.944 --> 1:13:03.311
[kenny] that's right, chris,
and something else
to keep an eye on

1:13:03.313 --> 1:13:05.980
are those beefy forks
on sawblaze.

1:13:05.982 --> 1:13:09.083
Jamison wants to use them
to get under mad catter

1:13:09.085 --> 1:13:12.920
and then ram them
into the wall,
screws and the upper deck.

1:13:12.922 --> 1:13:16.357
He used them to perfection
against minotaur.

1:13:16.359 --> 1:13:21.262
Let's see if he can repeat
that against a similarly
violent vertical spinner.

1:13:25.135 --> 1:13:27.135
In the blue square,

1:13:27.137 --> 1:13:30.972
this bot has multiple weapons
and they've always got a plan.

1:13:30.974 --> 1:13:34.942
Plus, a trash talking builder
who sounds like the macho man.

1:13:34.944 --> 1:13:38.446
But they ain't snapping
into slim jims,
that's not what they do.

1:13:38.448 --> 1:13:42.850
If they're breaking something
in half, it's definitely you.

1:13:42.852 --> 1:13:45.186
Oh, yeah.

1:13:45.188 --> 1:13:48.489
It's mad catter!

1:13:56.766 --> 1:14:00.802
[chris] martin mason, the
professor and his students.

1:14:00.804 --> 1:14:04.071
Oh, mad catter always
looking great.

1:14:04.073 --> 1:14:06.140
Kenny, tell us
about the weapon.

1:14:06.142 --> 1:14:09.143
[kenny] this is french fry,
their lightest vertical disc.

1:14:09.145 --> 1:14:12.280
It can reach top speed
in 2.2 seconds

1:14:12.282 --> 1:14:15.116
and mad catter is gonna need
that fast spin up time

1:14:15.118 --> 1:14:19.153
against a bot
as agile as sawblaze.

1:14:19.155 --> 1:14:23.124
[chris] look at this, kenny,
martin mason
is working the crowd.

1:14:23.893 --> 1:14:24.859
He's the man.

1:14:24.861 --> 1:14:27.395
Are you ready? Are you ready?

1:14:27.397 --> 1:14:31.132
[kenny] did anybody
play to the crowd like
martin mason?

1:14:32.702 --> 1:14:34.001
I love it.

1:14:35.538 --> 1:14:37.839
[kenny]
this is gonna be a fun one,
chris.

1:14:37.841 --> 1:14:38.840
Go, catter!

1:14:38.842 --> 1:14:41.375
Catter, looking good!

1:14:43.646 --> 1:14:46.647
[chris] the winner of this
match will move to 2-0

1:14:46.649 --> 1:14:50.084
with the best strength
of schedule
in the entire field

1:14:50.086 --> 1:14:55.556
and could be on track
for a top seed in this year's
world championship tournament.

1:14:58.228 --> 1:15:03.030
There's mad catter's flame
throwing minibot gassy cat.

1:15:03.032 --> 1:15:05.466
We'll see if it can get in
on the action as well.

1:15:10.940 --> 1:15:13.074
<i> [bot] robots activate.</i>

1:15:25.488 --> 1:15:28.089
<i> [bot] red team, ready.</i>

1:15:31.928 --> 1:15:33.561
Let's burn, baby.

1:15:34.297 --> 1:15:36.964
<i> [bot] blue team, ready.</i>

1:15:45.141 --> 1:15:47.074
Let's cook this cat.

1:15:55.218 --> 1:15:59.353
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

1:15:59.355 --> 1:16:04.392
Fight! Fight! Fight!

1:16:07.297 --> 1:16:08.863
[chris] let the bot battle
begin.

1:16:08.865 --> 1:16:11.999
Oh, a big time box rush
by mad catter.

1:16:13.903 --> 1:16:18.239
[kenny] maybe trying to defend
those forks in front
of sawblaze but...

1:16:18.241 --> 1:16:19.874
[chris] matt catter gets
caught.

1:16:19.876 --> 1:16:21.309
And, oh, no!

1:16:21.311 --> 1:16:23.911
What a hit,
right into the side of the
upper deck

1:16:23.913 --> 1:16:26.847
and then into the screws.

1:16:26.849 --> 1:16:27.949
Watch out, let's go!

1:16:27.951 --> 1:16:29.383
[kenny] this is what we're
talking about.

1:16:29.385 --> 1:16:32.119
Once they get underneath you,
you are in big time trouble.

1:16:32.121 --> 1:16:35.289
Jamison go taking
full advantage of it.

1:16:35.291 --> 1:16:37.658
Look at it with that
hammer saw on top.

1:16:37.660 --> 1:16:41.095
I think he just destroyed
the lifter off of mad catter,
chris.

1:16:41.097 --> 1:16:45.433
Oh, man,
that is a real problem
for the college kids.

1:16:46.703 --> 1:16:48.936
[chris] and you see the length
on those forks from sawblaze.

1:16:48.938 --> 1:16:53.207
That primary weapon
of mad catter doesn't have
the reach.

1:16:53.209 --> 1:16:56.210
[kenny] and if the hammer saw
wasn't enough, a real hammer,

1:16:56.212 --> 1:16:59.280
100-pound pulverizer
is doing some damage too.

1:16:59.282 --> 1:17:03.217
It's amazing how fast
that hammer
of sawblaze gets going.

1:17:03.219 --> 1:17:08.122
Guessing cat
is seeing stars now
and sawblaze finishes the job.

1:17:08.124 --> 1:17:10.625
The only way that mad catter's
gonna get to sawblaze

1:17:10.627 --> 1:17:13.227
and get around to the side
and maybe attack
one of those tires,

1:17:13.229 --> 1:17:15.896
but jamison go just so fast.

1:17:15.898 --> 1:17:17.832
Mad catter hanging in though.

1:17:17.834 --> 1:17:19.800
This is one tough robot.

1:17:19.802 --> 1:17:24.438
[chris] oh, absorbing
punishment but just keeps
coming back for more.

1:17:24.440 --> 1:17:26.807
And now it's put on its heels.

1:17:26.809 --> 1:17:28.409
Ready for this, kelvin!

1:17:28.411 --> 1:17:30.344
Mad catter getting put
on the screws

1:17:30.346 --> 1:17:33.280
and we've got something
smoking inside the battle box.

1:17:33.282 --> 1:17:34.415
Oh, my goodness.

1:17:34.417 --> 1:17:35.883
How do you like that?

1:17:35.885 --> 1:17:37.184
-How do you like that?
-This is crazy.

1:17:37.186 --> 1:17:41.656
[chris] the flame of sawblaze
breathing heat on mad catter.

1:17:41.658 --> 1:17:43.991
And now trying to establish
its dominance

1:17:43.993 --> 1:17:46.427
kind of like a rottweiler,
kenny.

1:17:47.397 --> 1:17:50.398
Oh, this is just nasty.

1:17:50.400 --> 1:17:52.800
Sawblaze continuing
to [inaudible]

1:17:52.802 --> 1:17:54.201
he's gonna put him up
on the upper deck.

1:17:54.203 --> 1:17:57.972
[kenny] this is just pure
brutality here from sawblaze.

1:17:57.974 --> 1:18:00.474
[chris] the battle box looks
like a haunted house.

1:18:00.476 --> 1:18:04.578
How much longer can mad catter
actually survive this assault?

1:18:05.181 --> 1:18:06.380
Just chewing him up.

1:18:06.382 --> 1:18:07.682
Whoa!

1:18:07.684 --> 1:18:09.383
They've got parts everywhere.

1:18:09.385 --> 1:18:11.285
The top armor
on the mad catter

1:18:11.287 --> 1:18:14.021
is just lying right there
in front of us.

1:18:14.023 --> 1:18:17.258
Holy smokes.
Let's go for a ride, big boy.

1:18:18.461 --> 1:18:20.327
30 seconds still to go.

1:18:20.329 --> 1:18:22.163
Can mad catter even make it?

1:18:22.165 --> 1:18:23.497
[kenny] wow.

1:18:24.267 --> 1:18:27.435
[chris] sheer domination
from jamison go.

1:18:27.437 --> 1:18:29.870
Do you have a heart, jamison?

1:18:29.872 --> 1:18:31.372
Of course, he doesn't.

1:18:31.374 --> 1:18:35.242
It's a black heart.
It's dark. It's dirty.

1:18:35.678 --> 1:18:37.311
[chris] oh, my goodness.

1:18:38.948 --> 1:18:39.914
[kenny] oh, no.

1:18:39.916 --> 1:18:42.983
[chris] stop, stop, he's
already dead.

1:18:43.986 --> 1:18:48.255
The countdown has started
and finally sawblaze backs off

1:18:48.257 --> 1:18:51.392
and it improves to 2-0.

1:18:57.133 --> 1:18:58.466
Good fight, guys.

1:18:58.468 --> 1:19:00.034
What?

1:19:07.276 --> 1:19:11.212
[chris] this was sheer
dominance by sawblaze
from the get-go, kenny.

1:19:11.214 --> 1:19:14.115
Yeah, both of these robots
were just unbelievable.

1:19:14.117 --> 1:19:17.651
But again, just sawblaze
just had too much firepower.

1:19:17.653 --> 1:19:20.988
And again their ability
to consistently get underneath
their opponents

1:19:20.990 --> 1:19:22.656
was the difference here.

1:19:22.658 --> 1:19:26.160
[kenny] it is so impressive
because once sawblaze
gets ahold of you,

1:19:26.162 --> 1:19:27.862
you're pretty much
at their mercy.

1:19:27.864 --> 1:19:30.131
[chris] yeah, exactly.
And they have no mercy.

1:19:30.133 --> 1:19:32.099
These guys
were going after it,

1:19:32.101 --> 1:19:35.302
they were looking
for the knockout
from the start of this fight.

1:19:35.304 --> 1:19:36.904
[kenny] that hammer saw is
nasty.

1:19:36.906 --> 1:19:39.206
And then few drivers utilize
the battle box

1:19:39.208 --> 1:19:42.743
and the weapons
at their disposal better
than jamison go.

1:19:42.745 --> 1:19:46.347
Right. Sawblaze
in past seasons they...
They had the driving,

1:19:46.349 --> 1:19:48.082
they had the ability
to get underneath you,

1:19:48.084 --> 1:19:49.984
they had the power,

1:19:49.986 --> 1:19:53.087
but their primary weapon
was never this dangerous.

1:19:53.089 --> 1:19:54.789
Now that they have
that dialed in,

1:19:54.791 --> 1:19:56.824
they have to be one
of the favorites right now.

1:19:56.826 --> 1:20:00.828
And, boy, did they utilize
the upper deck
to perfection as well.

1:20:00.830 --> 1:20:05.633
They utilized the sides of it,
the screws as well
and got the w.

1:20:10.306 --> 1:20:14.441
Jamison go, is this sawblaze's
year or what?

1:20:14.443 --> 1:20:16.143
What do you think?

1:20:17.079 --> 1:20:18.679
What do you think?

1:20:18.681 --> 1:20:20.681
What do you think?

1:20:20.683 --> 1:20:22.049
What do you think?

1:20:22.051 --> 1:20:24.652
Oh, yeah, okay, you asked
me first, that's fair.

1:20:24.654 --> 1:20:27.655
I think it's sawblaze's year.
What do you guys think?

1:20:30.626 --> 1:20:33.127
Yeah, baby!

1:20:33.129 --> 1:20:37.064
Jamison, all jokes aside,
it looks like you've taken
this weapon

1:20:37.066 --> 1:20:39.099
to an entirely
different level.

1:20:40.102 --> 1:20:41.235
Yeah.

1:20:41.337 --> 1:20:43.871
I mean, we've been working
on this for so many seasons

1:20:43.873 --> 1:20:45.706
that now we got
the knockout power,

1:20:45.708 --> 1:20:48.909
we've got the durability
and now we've got
the ground game so far.

1:20:48.911 --> 1:20:51.378
So, we're feeling really good
about that one.

1:20:51.380 --> 1:20:52.947
We're feeling good
about our chances.

1:20:52.949 --> 1:20:54.114
We're gonna keep going.

1:20:54.116 --> 1:20:57.051
Jamison,
I know that the giant nut
is the ultimate goal.

1:20:57.053 --> 1:21:01.488
But, of course, you also wanna
be the number one seed
heading into the round of 32.

1:21:01.490 --> 1:21:03.490
The selection committee
is closely watching this.

1:21:03.492 --> 1:21:05.125
What do you have
to say to them?

1:21:05.328 --> 1:21:07.027
What do you think?

1:21:10.867 --> 1:21:12.433
Jamison go, congratulations.

1:21:12.435 --> 1:21:15.502
Sawblaze 2-0
on the young season.

1:21:15.504 --> 1:21:17.671
-Thank you very much.
-Slash and burn.

1:21:18.274 --> 1:21:20.007
Slash and burn.

1:21:23.679 --> 1:21:24.712
[chris] martin mason.

1:21:24.714 --> 1:21:26.947
Oh, yeah, I'm still here.

1:21:26.949 --> 1:21:31.085
I'll tell you what, you know
there is no shame
in losing like that.

1:21:31.087 --> 1:21:32.486
That was incredible.

1:21:32.488 --> 1:21:34.188
They drove incredibly.

1:21:34.190 --> 1:21:35.356
They hit incredibly.

1:21:35.358 --> 1:21:37.658
You know, anybody
who watched that saw,

1:21:37.660 --> 1:21:40.094
those were two
incredible robots.

1:21:40.096 --> 1:21:42.630
Kudos to them, man.
They brought it.

1:21:42.632 --> 1:21:45.032
You know what,
but you saw what we can do.

1:21:45.034 --> 1:21:48.302
We're going to see him again
going for the giant nut, man.

1:21:48.304 --> 1:21:51.238
That was amazing.
No shame, folks.

1:21:51.240 --> 1:21:52.907
Amazing fight.

1:21:52.909 --> 1:21:55.042
Thank you to them
for bringing it.

1:21:55.044 --> 1:21:56.210
Wow, thank you.

1:21:56.212 --> 1:21:59.947
Martin, what is it like
when you're watching
your robot

1:21:59.949 --> 1:22:05.319
just being carried from rail
to rail to the upper deck?

1:22:05.321 --> 1:22:08.155
You know what,
things can change
in a split second.

1:22:08.157 --> 1:22:10.024
And that's the thing
about this sport.

1:22:10.026 --> 1:22:15.162
These kids they think so fast,
things move so quick,
it can change in an instant.

1:22:15.164 --> 1:22:17.398
But you know what,
we're gonna
keep coming back.

1:22:17.400 --> 1:22:19.433
We got a little bit
of repair to do.

1:22:19.435 --> 1:22:21.235
And, you know,
you're gonna see us again.

1:22:21.237 --> 1:22:23.037
This isn't over.

1:22:23.039 --> 1:22:25.973
Martin, you're 1-1,
you're still alive, man.
Great fight.

1:22:25.975 --> 1:22:28.409
Thank you. Thank you, folks.

1:22:38.020 --> 1:22:40.988
[chris] well, as you can tell,
jamison go of sawblaze

1:22:40.990 --> 1:22:46.427
is super excited
but he will not be happy
until he wins the giant nut.

1:22:46.429 --> 1:22:50.931
I know it's still early,
but he might be very happy
here in the 2021 season.

1:22:50.933 --> 1:22:52.333
He was a beast out there.

1:22:52.335 --> 1:22:54.935
Definitely
established himself
as one of the favorites.

1:22:54.937 --> 1:22:57.705
[chris] and two other teams
that had great runs in 2020,

1:22:57.707 --> 1:23:01.041
tantrum, of course, made it
all the way to the semifinals,
they're 2-0,

1:23:01.043 --> 1:23:05.179
ribbot, which made it all
the way to the quarterfinals
this season though, also 2-0.

1:23:05.181 --> 1:23:06.847
A pair of teams you gotta
keep your eye on.

1:23:06.849 --> 1:23:09.750
Yeah, no doubt.
Ribbot, two wins,
two knockouts.

1:23:09.752 --> 1:23:10.818
Very impressive.

1:23:10.820 --> 1:23:12.653
And tantrum right back
to their winning ways.

1:23:12.655 --> 1:23:14.655
Season is just
getting rolling.

1:23:14.657 --> 1:23:16.357
For faruq, our bot whisper,

1:23:16.359 --> 1:23:18.125
pete, my man kenny florian,

1:23:18.127 --> 1:23:21.562
I am chris rose, we'll see you
<i> next time here on battlebots.</i>
