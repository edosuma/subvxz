WEBVTT

00:03.400 --> 00:06.800
Hey. Check it out.
I got my first story in the school paper.

00:06.700 --> 00:09.800
Neat. Oh. They spelled
your name wrong.

00:09.700 --> 00:12.600
Apparently you're
"Donna Pincipotti."

00:13.800 --> 00:17.400
That's funny 'cause it's got
the potty sound in it.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.900
Hey, you know what else
is a funny sound?

00:21.300 --> 00:23.400
Where the hell is Jackie
with your van, man?

00:23.300 --> 00:26.800
- I want to get out of here.
- Ah, she had to help her aunt move a couch.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.200
Why did you lend Jackie your van?
She hates you, man.

00:29.100 --> 00:32.000
Well, I'm trying to
get on her good side, Fez.

00:31.900 --> 00:34.500
I mean, this is a small town
with a limited number of women.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.800
And I've already gone all the way through 'em
once, and now I'm back toJackie.

00:39.700 --> 00:41.600
Oh. And I love her.

00:43.400 --> 00:47.000
- Hey.
- Hey. So, how'd it go, baby?

00:46.900 --> 00:50.500
- Oh. Great.
- Cool.

00:50.400 --> 00:53.200
Yeah. Oh, except for
when I crashed your van.

00:54.400 --> 00:56.900
But other than that, cool.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
How did this happen?
Jackie, how?

01:04.900 --> 01:07.300
- Michael, like I said-
- How?

01:07.300 --> 01:11.000
- Coming out of the drive-
- [Screams] How?

01:10.900 --> 01:14.100
Kelso. Come on, man.
Relax.

01:14.100 --> 01:16.600
Let those of us who aren't you
enjoy this moment.

01:18.500 --> 01:21.000
Besides, it's not all that bad.
This door still works.

01:26.200 --> 01:29.100
Hey, Jackie.
What happened to the other door?

01:29.900 --> 01:32.000
Other door?

01:32.100 --> 01:34.600
Yeah, you know,
the thing that always got in the way...

01:34.500 --> 01:38.000
of this giant,
gaping hole.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.100
Jackie, what are these?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Uh-

01:42.900 --> 01:45.400
Van sticks.

01:45.400 --> 01:50.300
No. Jackie, these-
these are not van sticks.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.900
These are drumsticks.

01:52.800 --> 01:54.800
Whose drumsticks are they?

01:54.800 --> 01:56.900
Oh, wow, Jackie.
What's up?

02:01.000 --> 02:04.800
Okay. Fine. You know what? I used your van
to drive Chip and his band to a gig.

02:04.700 --> 02:07.100
Jackie...

02:07.100 --> 02:09.199
is Chip a girl?

02:12.900 --> 02:15.100
Uh, no.

02:16.100 --> 02:18.600
You had other guys
in my van?

02:18.500 --> 02:20.600
You're dating a band?

02:22.500 --> 02:25.100
It wasn't a date.
It was a gig.

02:25.100 --> 02:28.400
Whatever it was,
it was a gross misuse of van.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.100
And, uh-And you owe me money-
big-time!

02:32.100 --> 02:34.000
I owe you money?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.700
What about all the stuff I bought you
while we were together?

02:36.700 --> 02:40.400
That does not count. You gave me
those things so I would love you.

02:48.500 --> 02:50.500
Hangin'out

02:51.600 --> 02:53.600
Down the street

02:55.100 --> 02:57.200
The same old thing

02:58.800 --> 03:00.800
We did last week

03:01.900 --> 03:05.700
Not a thing to do

03:05.500 --> 03:08.900
But talk to you

03:08.800 --> 03:11.300
We're all all right

03:11.300 --> 03:13.200
We're all all right

03:13.200 --> 03:15.600
Hello, Wisconsin.!

03:20.200 --> 03:23.600
Look what I've got.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.800
Ew. What's that?

03:26.700 --> 03:28.700
That is Marissa.

03:28.600 --> 03:31.200
Carol's baby.

03:31.200 --> 03:34.200
And you promised me last night
that you'd babysit her.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.400
Last night? But I was drunk.

03:37.500 --> 03:39.100
Why can't you do it?

03:39.200 --> 03:41.800
- Because you promised.
- [Scoffs]

03:41.700 --> 03:44.100
- And besides-
- [Cooing]

03:44.100 --> 03:47.800
Your father and I are having fondue
and Parcheesi at the Pinciottis'.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.800
Oh?

03:49.800 --> 03:51.800
Then I'll do it.

03:51.700 --> 03:54.200
No. Laurie can watch this baby tonight.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.200
Oh, golly,
Laurie, a baby.

03:56.100 --> 03:58.700
And just in time
for your Black Mass.

03:58.600 --> 04:02.500
Hey. What did I tell you about
calling your sister the devil?

04:03.300 --> 04:06.500
That it's offensive
to the devil?

04:11.700 --> 04:14.400
No, Laurie. You can't
feed a baby bacon.

04:15.400 --> 04:18.899
Okay, okay.
What color is the baby?

04:20.300 --> 04:23.500
Well, good.
Now, if that changes, call me.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.800
- Is everything okay?
- Oh, yes.

04:26.800 --> 04:30.000
We have just got the cutest little baby
over at our house right now.

04:29.900 --> 04:33.900
- Isn't she cute, Red?
- Yeah, I just can't get over it.

04:33.700 --> 04:35.700
Geez, Bob.

04:35.600 --> 04:39.000
You got your fingers
in the cheese.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.400
Remember how cute Laurie and Eric were
when they were babies?

04:42.300 --> 04:44.600
They used to just
laugh and play.

04:44.600 --> 04:48.100
Well, every time I was around
all they did was scream.

04:48.100 --> 04:51.100
I just think it would be nice
to have a baby around the house again.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.900
Oh, damn it, Bob.

04:54.100 --> 04:57.500
Get your fingers
out of the cheese.

05:01.400 --> 05:04.400
[Groaning]

05:06.600 --> 05:09.200
[Groans]

05:12.200 --> 05:15.800
[Groans] Do you think it would still do
this if I stopped feeding it?

05:17.100 --> 05:20.200
- Oh, Laurie, let me do that.
- [Cooing]

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
[Cooing]

05:29.000 --> 05:31.900
Wow. How'd you do
that last move?

05:31.800 --> 05:34.200
It's all in the wrist.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.500
See?

05:36.500 --> 05:38.500
Hey.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.300
- Look at the wrist on my girl.
- Shut up.

05:44.100 --> 05:46.400
Let's go.

05:46.400 --> 05:51.000
Wait. Wait, no. Donna, wait.
I think it really likes you.

05:50.900 --> 05:53.000
Ooh. I think it just
said your name.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.300
[Mimicking Baby Voice]
Donna!

05:56.400 --> 05:59.000
Hey, you know, you were
really good in there.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.100
Well, it's not exactly
brain surgery.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.800
I know, but it was so cool.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.000
It's just-
I think it's really, really...

06:06.000 --> 06:08.100
cool that you can do that.

06:08.900 --> 06:10.800
Eric, you're, like,
over the moon...

06:10.800 --> 06:12.700
'cause I changed
a poopy diaper, but...

06:12.800 --> 06:14.800
when I got my story
in the school paper...

06:14.800 --> 06:17.300
all you said was,
"Yeah, they called you Donna Pincipotti."

06:17.100 --> 06:19.500
It's a funny sound.
"Potti."

06:19.500 --> 06:21.500
Come on. Try not to laugh.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.000
That's good.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.300
Come on, Donna.
About the diaper thing-

06:29.300 --> 06:31.300
I was just paying you
a compliment.

06:31.200 --> 06:35.200
- What was the compliment?
- That you are gonna be so...

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
great staying home
with our kids.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
What?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.500
Eric, how exactly
do you see our future?

06:44.000 --> 06:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:07.400 --> 07:09.800
Okay, okay. That could work.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.500
I would just like to adjust
one little thing.

07:30.900 --> 07:33.900
Okay. The businesswoman
idea is good.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.800
But what about this?

07:36.800 --> 07:40.600
[Disco]

08:10.700 --> 08:13.100
Okay. Uh-huh. Yeah.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.100
I would just change
one thing.

08:15.100 --> 08:18.900
[Disco]

08:28.200 --> 08:30.800
[Continues]

08:39.100 --> 08:41.600
That seems more
hurtful than sexy.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.299
Jackass.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.600
So does that.

08:47.700 --> 08:51.900
- You owe me money.
- Michael, your uncle gave you that van for free.

08:51.800 --> 08:55.200
Yeah? Well, I put a lot of money
into that van.

08:55.100 --> 08:57.100
The shag carpeting...

08:57.100 --> 08:59.200
uh, eight track...

09:00.600 --> 09:04.200
strobe light, black light,
red light.

09:04.100 --> 09:06.800
- I hate you.
- Well, I hate you more.

09:06.800 --> 09:09.300
- I hate you most.
- Well, I hate you the-

09:09.300 --> 09:11.200
Damn it!

09:12.500 --> 09:15.000
All right. All right.
Let's just act like adults...

09:15.000 --> 09:18.800
and treat this like
what it really is: A divorce.

09:19.900 --> 09:22.200
Oh, Jackie, you get
custody of me.

09:25.700 --> 09:29.200
All right. Let's just figure out
what you guys owe each other.

09:29.100 --> 09:32.600
Fine. I'm not afraid.
I'm right, and he's a total moocher.

09:32.400 --> 09:37.100
I'm not afraid either.
There are laws to protect a man and his van.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.200
For instance,
the Man-Van Act of 1847.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.200
Right.

09:46.100 --> 09:48.500
All right. All right.

09:48.400 --> 09:50.400
Jackie...

09:50.300 --> 09:55.200
in your opinion, what are the goods
and services that Kelso owes you for?

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Everything.
He was a total doofus before I met him.

09:57.900 --> 10:01.000
In fact,
I bought you that belt.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
So hand it over.
And the shirt too.

10:02.900 --> 10:07.300
Fine. You know, this shirt has bad memories
of you buying me stuff anyway.

10:08.500 --> 10:11.300
Here. Let me do the math.
[Clears Throat]

10:11.200 --> 10:15.300
Okay. Now, Kelso-

10:15.200 --> 10:18.200
Uh, Kelso owes Jackie the price
for breaking her beautiful heart...

10:18.100 --> 10:21.100
and stealing her innocence.

10:21.100 --> 10:24.000
Now, Kelso, what do you believe
Jackie owes you?

10:23.900 --> 10:27.500
Well- Uh-

10:27.500 --> 10:30.100
W- One time I told her
that she looked pretty...

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
when really she looked
pretty skanky.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.200
And-

10:41.500 --> 10:44.200
And-

10:44.200 --> 10:45.900
Hyde, help me out here.

10:45.900 --> 10:47.900
Okay. Let me think.

10:47.900 --> 10:50.000
Oh. Don't forget
he burned your house.

10:49.900 --> 10:54.200
- Hyde.
- Dude, you burned her house.

10:59.300 --> 11:03.200
Oh, and that clean
baby smell.

11:04.100 --> 11:06.600
Yes, but when we had babies...

11:06.500 --> 11:08.900
we couldn't go to
the movies or out to dinner.

11:08.900 --> 11:12.600
Oh, Red. When was the last time
we went to the movies or out to dinner?

11:12.500 --> 11:15.400
Exactly. Who needs to leave the house
when there are no babies in it?

11:16.700 --> 11:21.000
I gotta thank my lucky stars
I got the old snippety-snip.

11:20.900 --> 11:24.900
Bob, you mean you just
let some quack remove-

11:24.900 --> 11:27.100
On, no.
Nothing's removed.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.400
Okay. That's enough of that.

11:30.300 --> 11:34.200
Yeah, well, I guess it's okay if it means
you don't have to have any more babies.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.500
Oh, Red, it was fun having babies.
Remember fun?

11:37.500 --> 11:40.500
Yes, Kitty, but it was also
a large responsibility.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.700
Or burden, if you will.

11:42.700 --> 11:46.500
Red Forman, I don't want to hear another word
out of you unless it's "I love babies."

11:48.400 --> 11:52.700
- Kitty, you're making a scene.
- That is not "I love babies."

11:52.600 --> 11:54.800
Kitty, what's the matter
with you?

11:54.700 --> 11:56.700
Oh, well, l- I don't-

11:56.600 --> 11:58.700
I don't want to ruin
our nice night out...

11:58.700 --> 12:04.500
because, boy, Midge, you can really
melt a super pot of cheese, but, um-

12:04.300 --> 12:06.200
I think I want another baby.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.500
Really?

12:10.500 --> 12:12.800
You like my cheese?

12:20.400 --> 12:23.100
This is Aqua Net.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.400
The same stuff Farrah uses.

12:25.400 --> 12:29.100
And she's got a big TV show,
and she's married to Lee Majors.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.500
So, Aqua Net, very important.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.900
Oh, come on, Red.

12:34.900 --> 12:38.800
Oh, look how sweet this baby is.
Just hold it.

12:38.600 --> 12:43.400
Look, Kitty. I didn't touch our kids when
they were babies, and I'm not touching this one.

12:43.200 --> 12:46.600
- Red Forman, you touch this baby.
- Nope.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.100
- Touch it.
- Not happening.

12:53.400 --> 12:57.100
Is this child
wearing lip liner?

13:04.600 --> 13:09.800
So, turns out my supersensitive guy boyfriend
wants me to be a baby machine.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.800
[Scoffs]
What a dill-hole.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.600
Donna,
I'm sitting right here.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.400
That's why I said it,
you dill-hole.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.500
Donna, the only reason
I thought you'd stay home with the babies...

13:24.400 --> 13:28.400
is because only every woman has done it
for the entire history of time.

13:28.400 --> 13:32.700
So, don't be mad at me.
Be mad at your... foremothers.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.400
Yeah.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.500
That is so typical.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.800
As if every woman wants to spend
her life as a pampered housewife...

13:40.700 --> 13:44.200
raising kids
and organizing the help.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Wait. Isn't that
what every woman wants?

13:47.000 --> 13:48.900
Donna, man...

13:48.900 --> 13:52.000
Forman's just limited
by his experiences.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.800
As the voice of a new generation
of smart, independent women...

13:55.600 --> 13:59.600
you need to make this dill-hole realize
that a mind and spirit like yours...

13:59.400 --> 14:01.500
has more options
than your mothers had.

14:03.500 --> 14:06.100
Yeah.

14:06.100 --> 14:08.500
Sorry. What?

14:08.400 --> 14:10.900
All right, Donna. So...

14:10.900 --> 14:12.900
are we cool?

14:23.100 --> 14:27.100
I'm not wrong.
Women take care of babies.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.700
- They do.
- Listen to him, Marissa.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.400
He whines like a girl,
but he's not a girl.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.400
Or maybe he is.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.700
The thing is,
Donna's really good at it.

14:38.500 --> 14:42.100
I mean, I could understand you not wanting
to stay home with your children.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.100
You already have
such a fulfilling career as a whore.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.700
Listen, twerp.

14:50.700 --> 14:54.000
Did you ever think maybe it's not that
she doesn't want to have babies?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.800
Maybe she just doesn't want to have
your skinny, whiny...

14:56.800 --> 15:00.000
girl-trapped-in-a-boy-body
babies.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.400
Okay. That's one for you.

15:16.300 --> 15:19.100
I'm cold.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.300
That must be why
your nipples are so pointy.

15:30.800 --> 15:33.300
Oh, pointy nipple man
is mad.

15:36.100 --> 15:39.700
I hope he doesn't poke me
with his pointy nipples.

15:44.400 --> 15:46.900
All right.
That was really disturbing.

15:46.800 --> 15:49.500
Okay. Here we go.

15:49.400 --> 15:53.200
According to my calculations,
for repairs to the van...

15:53.200 --> 15:55.200
Jackie, you owe Kelso $65.

15:55.100 --> 15:57.800
Aha! Justice!

16:03.100 --> 16:05.000
Yeah.

16:06.500 --> 16:09.400
And, Kelso, you oweJackie...

16:09.300 --> 16:11.900
$8,265.

16:11.900 --> 16:14.000
Pay up, moocher!

16:14.000 --> 16:16.800
Wha-Wha-
No, no.

16:16.700 --> 16:18.800
This is-
That's totally unfair!

16:18.700 --> 16:20.700
Hyde, you suck.

16:20.600 --> 16:24.500
You could have been a man and forgiven her.
But no. You wanted to do the math.

16:24.300 --> 16:27.800
Man, math has never
been my friend.

16:27.800 --> 16:31.000
Wait. No. But she had
other guys in my van.

16:30.900 --> 16:34.600
Michael, you had other girls
in your van while we were dating.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.400
So, give me my $8,000.

16:38.100 --> 16:41.700
Okay. I change my mind.
I forgive you.

16:48.700 --> 16:51.600
See, if we had
a baby right now...

16:51.600 --> 16:53.500
we could be
giving it a bath.

16:53.500 --> 16:56.200
We could be putting it
in its warm little jammies.

16:56.100 --> 17:00.100
Yeah. It's a shame that
we have to crawl into bed...

17:00.000 --> 17:03.700
for eight hours of
uninterrupted sleep instead.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.599
Come on.

17:05.599 --> 17:07.700
You don't really want
another baby.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.599
Well, I don't know.

17:09.599 --> 17:12.700
I only have a few years left
where I even have the option.

17:12.599 --> 17:17.800
Well, just because you can have a baby
doesn't mean you should.

17:17.700 --> 17:22.599
I have a snowblower,
but I don't use it in July.

17:26.400 --> 17:28.600
Red, it just-

17:28.600 --> 17:33.500
It feels like maybe we've done everything
important there is to do.

17:33.400 --> 17:37.400
We saved up.
We got our house. We had our kids.

17:37.300 --> 17:39.400
Now what's left
to look forward to?

17:39.400 --> 17:41.300
Peace and quiet.

17:42.600 --> 17:46.000
[Baby Crying]

17:45.900 --> 17:48.300
Well...

17:48.300 --> 17:51.900
I just can't believe we're never gonna hear
that sound in our house again.

17:51.900 --> 17:54.800
Well, until we have
grandchildren.

18:00.400 --> 18:03.500
Grandchildren!

18:04.300 --> 18:07.500
Oh, I forgot about
grandchildren!

18:11.900 --> 18:14.500
- [Door Closes]
- So did I.

18:17.900 --> 18:21.200
[Laughing]
Oh, boy.

18:21.100 --> 18:26.000
I like the looks of that.
My baby with a baby.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.800
It's not that hard.

18:27.800 --> 18:30.600
I heard her crying,
and I figured she needed a bottle...

18:30.500 --> 18:32.600
and it turned out
that she did.

18:33.800 --> 18:36.300
So, um...

18:37.600 --> 18:40.100
you think you might want
a baby of your own?

18:40.000 --> 18:44.400
Well, yeah. I mean, once my looks
start to go, why not?

18:47.100 --> 18:50.700
All right. So, how many kids
are we talking here?

18:50.700 --> 18:52.800
One? Two? Six?

18:53.700 --> 18:55.600
Whoa, Mom. Ease up, okay?

18:55.600 --> 18:57.800
I'm not even down to
one boyfriend yet.

18:59.100 --> 19:01.100
But- But you will be
soon, right?

19:01.100 --> 19:05.000
Well, Zeke gets out of jail
in three months.

19:04.800 --> 19:06.800
Okay.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.100
Uh, I'm- I'm- I'm gonna
go talk to Eric.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.800
Mom...

19:14.800 --> 19:17.300
are you happy?

19:17.300 --> 19:20.300
Sure.
What's this about?

19:20.300 --> 19:22.500
I don't know. It's, like...

19:22.500 --> 19:25.100
Eric said this stupid thing about me
not working when we're married...

19:25.100 --> 19:30.500
and I just want to do something more meaningful
with my life than have kids, you know?

19:30.200 --> 19:32.800
- No offense.
- No. No. That's okay.

19:32.800 --> 19:35.900
It's not like I never wondered
what my life could have been like...

19:35.800 --> 19:37.800
if I hadn't married
your father.

19:37.700 --> 19:40.400
I mean, l-
Well, I could have been a doctor.

19:40.400 --> 19:43.100
- Exactly.
- Or a dancing girl.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.400
Right.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.900
Oh, honey. Don't worry
so much about what Eric said.

19:48.800 --> 19:51.600
You're probably not even gonna
have to deal with this anyway.

19:51.500 --> 19:55.700
- How do you figure that?
- Well, you and Eric are so young.

19:55.700 --> 19:58.200
The chances are you're not gonna
end up together anyway.

20:02.800 --> 20:06.200
All right, Donna. That's it.
We gotta figure this out.

20:06.200 --> 20:10.600
Because this is just hanging over our heads
like one of those huge, awful hanging things.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.200
Let's not worry
about this anymore.

20:15.100 --> 20:17.100
Let's, uh-
Let's go for a drive, okay?

20:18.200 --> 20:20.200
Okay.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.600
I'm sorry.
Did you want to say something else?

20:27.500 --> 20:29.800
No. Just...

20:29.700 --> 20:31.700
I love you.

20:31.600 --> 20:34.100
Oh.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.000
- Enough to strip for me?
- All right.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.700
No. I mean I love you too.
I'd strip for you.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.300
Laurie, her mother
is waiting.

20:43.400 --> 20:46.500
I don't care. I love her,
and I'm not giving her back!

20:48.200 --> 20:51.500
- What are you doing with that?
- Give me back the baby, missy, or, so help me...

20:51.500 --> 20:53.400
the dryer goes down.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.600
- You wouldn't.
- I would.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.500
Fine, fine. Take her.

21:00.400 --> 21:03.200
[Coos]

21:06.600 --> 21:10.100
Shh, baby.
You're okay now.
