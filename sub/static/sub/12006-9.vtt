00:00.146 --> 00:01.913
<i>Previously on "Switched at Birth"... </i>

00:02.307 --> 00:04.681
I do have feelings for Campbell.

00:04.716 --> 00:06.049
But I have them for you too.

00:06.084 --> 00:07.751
What am I supposed to do with that?

00:07.785 --> 00:08.752
I don't know.

00:09.954 --> 00:11.088
Those aren't mine.

00:11.122 --> 00:13.123
- You slept with Aida?
- It just happened.

00:13.157 --> 00:15.726
- You didn't do it.
- You can't tell her.

00:15.760 --> 00:18.028
- "Nine Innings of Grey." Totally.
- I sold a book idea.

00:18.077 --> 00:19.878
<i>John: Kathryn, are you out of your mind?</i>

00:19.913 --> 00:21.747
You are talking about intimate details

00:21.781 --> 00:22.915
of our friends' lives.

00:22.949 --> 00:24.783
I never thought I'd be dating a frat guy.

00:24.818 --> 00:26.018
What fraternity is Tank in again?

00:26.052 --> 00:28.020
- Omega psi!
- One of them invited me

00:28.054 --> 00:30.756
- to that luau they're having.
- It's a dogfight.

00:30.790 --> 00:32.090
- A what?
- It's a contest,

00:32.125 --> 00:33.759
between a bunch of the brothers

00:33.793 --> 00:36.094
to see who can bring the ugliest date.

00:36.129 --> 00:38.030
<i>Yvette: Oh, no, you don't!</i>

00:38.064 --> 00:40.032
<i>Just back off!</i>

00:40.066 --> 00:41.934
- What's the matter?
- We are going now.

00:41.968 --> 00:43.769
I need your help.

00:43.803 --> 00:45.070
- What should I do?
- Do it.

00:46.773 --> 00:47.973
- (Exhales deeply)
- (Air hissing)

00:48.007 --> 00:49.641
You did good.

00:54.681 --> 00:56.715
Hey, Dr. J. Sorry I gotta take off,

00:56.749 --> 00:58.050
but I finished all those files.

00:58.084 --> 00:59.885
Well, thank you.

00:59.919 --> 01:01.753
Will I see you at the
open house Thursday night?

01:01.788 --> 01:03.755
I thought that was just for regular staff.

01:03.790 --> 01:06.592
You really need me to keep
telling you you're more than just

01:06.626 --> 01:07.993
another volunteer?

01:08.027 --> 01:09.995
In fact, I was hoping to introduce you to

01:10.063 --> 01:12.931
one of our board members...
a cardiac surgeon.

01:12.966 --> 01:14.867
He runs a summer pre-med program

01:14.901 --> 01:16.635
at K.U. Med Center.

01:16.669 --> 01:18.837
And I think you'd be an ideal candidate.

01:18.872 --> 01:21.039
That would be amazing.

01:21.074 --> 01:23.041
Thank you, Dr. J.

01:25.979 --> 01:27.746
Oh, hey.

01:27.780 --> 01:29.715
I'm glad I caught you.

01:29.749 --> 01:30.949
Can you cover for Oscar tomorrow?

01:30.984 --> 01:32.684
I got a game. Sorry.

01:32.719 --> 01:33.819
Is he okay?

01:33.853 --> 01:35.954
He got that cold that's been going around.

01:35.989 --> 01:37.956
Oh. And...

01:37.991 --> 01:38.957
are you coming on Thursday?

01:39.025 --> 01:40.926
Oh, yeah. Fundraiser, sounds fun.

01:41.961 --> 01:43.996
Oh! Keys to the filing cabinet.

01:44.030 --> 01:46.665
Ah! He shoots, he scores.

01:46.699 --> 01:47.933
Ha-ha.

01:47.967 --> 01:49.668
Uh, where are you going?

01:49.702 --> 01:51.970
Field hockey practice.
And I am about to be late.

01:52.005 --> 01:53.906
Hang on, are you going to the open house?

01:53.940 --> 01:55.874
Yeah, I'll be there. Sounds fun.

01:55.909 --> 01:57.109
You wanna grab a bite to eat before?

01:58.745 --> 02:00.012
Or we could...

02:00.046 --> 02:01.880
all eat there together.

02:01.915 --> 02:03.649
There's food, right?

02:03.683 --> 02:05.684
Yeah. Bad cheese and cheap wine.

02:05.718 --> 02:07.052
I'll make something.

02:07.086 --> 02:08.620
If you need any help
getting anything together,

02:08.655 --> 02:09.621
I...

02:10.889 --> 02:11.857
(sneezes)

02:11.891 --> 02:14.026
Uh, he should not be handling food.

02:14.060 --> 02:15.794
It was a sneeze, Campbell.

02:15.828 --> 02:17.663
Okay then! I'll see you both there.

02:19.732 --> 02:21.833
It's my mom's patented feel-better soup.

02:21.868 --> 02:23.068
Totally works on post hand surgery too.

02:23.102 --> 02:25.737
Aw, it's got a ribbon and everything.

02:25.772 --> 02:28.006
That's to make up for the fact
that it was made in a dorm room.

02:28.041 --> 02:30.008
It's really nice. Thank you.

02:30.043 --> 02:31.843
So, obvious question:

02:31.878 --> 02:33.712
How cute is your physical therapist?

02:33.746 --> 02:35.714
I haven't started P.T.
yet, but as soon as I do,

02:35.748 --> 02:37.616
I will update you on the cuteness factor.

02:37.650 --> 02:39.051
(Laughs) Good.

02:39.085 --> 02:40.752
Good, because I have this
whole fantasy mapped out.

02:40.787 --> 02:42.821
<i>- See, his name is Lars.
- Uh?</i>

02:42.855 --> 02:43.822
Who's Lars?

02:43.856 --> 02:45.057
The physical therapist

02:45.091 --> 02:47.626
who's about to fall
hopelessly in love with Bay.

02:47.660 --> 02:48.994
<i>And then they'll move to Sweden and start</i>

02:49.028 --> 02:50.796
a clinic-slash-art studio.

02:50.830 --> 02:51.830
She's making this whole thing up.

02:51.864 --> 02:53.098
(Laughing) Great.

02:53.132 --> 02:54.800
'Cause I was about to say

02:54.834 --> 02:56.835
I wonder what Tank would think about that.

02:56.869 --> 02:58.036
<i>By the way, he just called.</i>

02:58.071 --> 02:59.871
<i>He wants to bring some classwork by.</i>

02:59.906 --> 03:01.006
Uh... great.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.709
So, you guys are still...

03:04.911 --> 03:05.944
Have you met him?

03:05.979 --> 03:07.980
Because he is the sweetest guy.

03:08.014 --> 03:10.048
Although, I'm not supposed
to have an opinion.

03:10.083 --> 03:12.651
Uh, I would really like to...

03:12.685 --> 03:14.052
Uh, try the soup. Could you?

03:14.087 --> 03:16.888
Oh, sure. I'll heat it up.

03:16.923 --> 03:18.824
Pretty.

03:18.858 --> 03:20.659
(Smacks lips) Uh...

03:20.693 --> 03:22.027
Actually, wow. I'm gonna be
late for this study group.

03:22.061 --> 03:23.729
Okay, wait.

03:23.763 --> 03:26.632
Look, I know the whole Omega
Psi thing was completely gross,

03:26.666 --> 03:27.833
but Tank is a really good guy.

03:27.867 --> 03:29.001
I gotta go, but I'll check in on you later.

03:29.035 --> 03:30.002
Okay?

03:35.708 --> 03:36.842
(Sighs)

03:38.645 --> 03:43.613
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:44.651 --> 03:46.018
If we could have just
stopped that last play...

03:46.052 --> 03:47.686
Mm-mm, it wasn't our defense.

03:47.720 --> 03:49.888
It was us. We suck.

03:49.922 --> 03:51.790
At least there's only one more game.

03:51.824 --> 03:53.892
Yeah, one last chance to get slaughtered.

03:57.930 --> 04:00.032
Okay, guys, listen up.

04:02.001 --> 04:03.969
Next week, we're going
up against the school

04:04.003 --> 04:05.737
that I happen to know pretty well.

04:05.772 --> 04:06.738
Buckner.

04:06.773 --> 04:09.574
<i>Conference champions... </i>

04:09.609 --> 04:11.910
Versus a team that started two months ago.

04:11.944 --> 04:14.846
That hasn't gotten a single win all season.

04:14.881 --> 04:16.848
Anyone who thinks

04:16.882 --> 04:19.685
that we can't turn this around,

04:19.719 --> 04:20.952
you just ask Daphne and Melissa.

04:20.987 --> 04:23.889
Carlton basketball

04:23.923 --> 04:25.791
came out of nowhere and crushed it.

04:25.825 --> 04:26.792
Right?

04:28.661 --> 04:31.063
So forget about the rest of the season.

04:31.097 --> 04:33.965
Next week is your chance

04:34.000 --> 04:37.069
<i>to show everyone who
thinks that we are done</i>

04:37.103 --> 04:39.705
<i>that they are wrong.</i>

04:39.739 --> 04:42.040
You do not underestimate

04:42.075 --> 04:44.609
the Carlton Mustangs. Am I right?!

04:46.012 --> 04:46.978
Am I right?

04:52.819 --> 04:54.786
Choo, pow.

04:54.821 --> 04:56.655
Hey.

04:56.689 --> 04:57.856
Wow.

04:57.890 --> 04:59.091
That looks amazing.

04:59.125 --> 05:00.926
Salmon with curry sauce.

05:00.960 --> 05:05.030
And before you say anything,
that is low-fat coconut milk.

05:05.064 --> 05:06.598
Huh.

05:06.632 --> 05:07.766
Where'd you find that?

05:07.800 --> 05:09.901
Indian grocery store downtown.

05:09.936 --> 05:11.803
Who are you and what have
you done with my husband?

05:11.838 --> 05:12.971
(Chuckles)

05:13.005 --> 05:14.639
How's the writing going?

05:14.674 --> 05:15.807
Stressful.

05:15.842 --> 05:17.609
I keep getting e-mails from Lydia.

05:17.643 --> 05:19.878
She wants a full book proposal by Monday.

05:19.912 --> 05:21.780
Well, that's good she's excited, right?

05:21.814 --> 05:23.048
(Sighs) Yeah, but I
just keep thinking that

05:23.082 --> 05:26.785
I need a few more killer
stories to just seal the deal.

05:26.819 --> 05:27.919
Hmm.

05:27.954 --> 05:30.021
Hey, you're not holding out on me, are you?

05:30.056 --> 05:31.757
Sweetie, I was married to you

05:31.791 --> 05:33.725
most of the time I was
playing in the league.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.961
According to you, that
didn't stop most of the guys.

05:35.995 --> 05:37.729
Well, it stopped me.

05:39.966 --> 05:42.033
Though there's one guy that
might still be in K.C...

05:43.636 --> 05:45.637
Donny Barris.

05:45.671 --> 05:47.038
Third-base, '88 to '90.

05:47.073 --> 05:50.809
I'm talking this guy was off the charts.

05:50.843 --> 05:53.945
Gary Busey levels of debauchery.

05:53.980 --> 05:56.615
And you know what? He
loved to brag about it.

05:56.649 --> 05:58.617
That's great. Can we
have him over for dinner?

05:58.651 --> 06:00.852
Yeah, if he hasn't been
knifed by someone's husband.

06:00.887 --> 06:01.853
I'll look him up.

06:01.888 --> 06:03.688
You sure you don't mind?

06:05.825 --> 06:06.858
I know this book is happening

06:06.893 --> 06:07.893
whether I like it or not,

06:07.927 --> 06:10.729
so I figure, I might as well get on board.

06:10.763 --> 06:14.833
I just hope it doesn't make
you miss the wild old days.

06:14.867 --> 06:16.601
Ohh, you never know.

06:16.636 --> 06:17.869
I might walk through that door

06:17.904 --> 06:20.872
with a can of full-fat coconut milk.

06:20.907 --> 06:22.874
- (Inhales sharply)
- (Purrs) Mm.

06:24.877 --> 06:25.844
Hey.

06:25.878 --> 06:27.846
Regina: There you are.

06:27.880 --> 06:28.914
How was your game?

06:28.948 --> 06:31.750
Uh, pretty much the same as all the others.

06:31.784 --> 06:33.018
At least we got a few goals in.

06:33.052 --> 06:34.953
Oh, sorry.

06:34.987 --> 06:36.922
Hey, why don't we try that new vegan place,

06:36.956 --> 06:38.757
cheer you up with a tofu smoothie?

06:38.791 --> 06:39.791
Sounds good to me.

06:39.826 --> 06:42.027
Or I could just make something.

06:42.061 --> 06:44.830
Oh, you can make a nice pasta with this.

06:44.864 --> 06:46.631
Oh, that's for me.

06:46.666 --> 06:48.767
I'm making hors d'oeuvres for
the clinic on Thursday night.

06:48.801 --> 06:50.936
They're having a fundraiser.

06:50.970 --> 06:52.604
You can come if you want.

06:52.638 --> 06:54.673
Great, I would love to see the place.

06:54.707 --> 06:55.740
Me too?

06:55.775 --> 06:57.042
Sure.

06:57.076 --> 06:58.710
<i>Oh, and I was talking with Dr. J... </i>

06:58.744 --> 07:00.679
<i>- (Cellphone beeps)
- Mm-hmm.</i>

07:00.713 --> 07:02.614
<i>About this summer program with a surgeon.</i>

07:02.648 --> 07:04.783
He's gonna introduce me at the fundraiser.

07:04.817 --> 07:05.784
What type of program?

07:05.818 --> 07:07.018
You have to see this. Leo just sent it.

07:07.053 --> 07:09.621
- It's Abby.
- Oh.

07:09.655 --> 07:11.623
<i>(Gasps) Wow.</i>

07:11.657 --> 07:13.825
She has gotten so big.

07:13.860 --> 07:15.760
She's crawling like a little soldier.

07:15.795 --> 07:16.862
Cute.

07:16.896 --> 07:19.698
I forgot how fun it is
to watch them explore.

07:19.732 --> 07:21.566
(Clicks tongue)

07:21.601 --> 07:23.034
You were such a delicate little thing.

07:23.069 --> 07:24.803
Always watching.

07:24.837 --> 07:25.971
(Chuckles softly)

07:26.005 --> 07:27.939
- I should get dinner going.
- Oh.

07:32.011 --> 07:34.746
- It's alive.
- Oh!

07:34.780 --> 07:36.581
(Laughs)

07:36.616 --> 07:37.716
What are you doing?

07:37.750 --> 07:39.017
Definitely not doing any art.

07:39.051 --> 07:40.752
You'll get there.

07:40.786 --> 07:42.921
Oh, hey, here's the notes
from Ledarsky's class.

07:42.955 --> 07:46.691
Italian renaissance. Sorry,
there's a few pizza stains on there.

07:46.726 --> 07:48.693
Mm, at least you were eating on topic.

07:48.728 --> 07:51.897
Sorry. You probably didn't
wanna hear about art class.

07:51.964 --> 07:52.998
<i>No, it's not that.</i>

07:53.032 --> 07:55.901
It's just...

07:55.968 --> 07:58.036
my friend came over. Mary Beth,

07:58.070 --> 08:01.706
the one who was invited to the luau.

08:01.741 --> 08:02.841
Oh.

08:02.875 --> 08:04.809
She got all weird when I told her

08:04.844 --> 08:05.877
I was still dating you.

08:05.912 --> 08:07.979
What, she just expected you to dump me

08:08.014 --> 08:09.848
over a party I had nothing to do with?

08:09.882 --> 08:11.583
I just wish I could tell
her that you were the one

08:11.617 --> 08:12.684
who blew the whistle on the whole thing,

08:12.718 --> 08:13.685
and that's why it got cancelled.

08:13.719 --> 08:14.686
No way.

08:14.720 --> 08:16.788
- No no no.
- I know.

08:18.824 --> 08:20.592
(Exhales) All right, look.

08:20.660 --> 08:22.560
She just needs to get to know me.

08:22.595 --> 08:25.630
Okay? It's like when my
grandma's cat scratched me,

08:25.665 --> 08:27.565
I thought all cats were evil, right?

08:27.600 --> 08:28.867
And then I meet holstein,

08:28.901 --> 08:31.036
this hilarious black and white
Tom at my buddy Greg's house.

08:31.070 --> 08:32.871
And Holstein's like,

08:32.905 --> 08:34.572
"don't care that you're not into cats,

08:34.607 --> 08:35.874
I'm getting in your lap, dude."

08:35.908 --> 08:37.909
Sweetest guy ever.

08:37.943 --> 08:39.977
And now I love cats.

08:40.011 --> 08:43.715
I have no doubt about
your ability to charm her,

08:43.749 --> 08:45.817
but I just don't think
she'd even wanna hang out.

08:45.851 --> 08:47.919
(Both sigh)

08:47.954 --> 08:50.622
Unless we went somewhere

08:50.656 --> 08:53.625
and you just happened to show up.

08:53.659 --> 08:55.694
Ahh, I can do that.

08:55.728 --> 08:56.895
Give her the full Holstein treatment.

08:56.929 --> 08:58.730
Oh, please don't crawl in her lap.

08:58.764 --> 09:00.065
No? Is it... is that weird?

09:01.600 --> 09:02.767
<i>Toby: You need to get a 90</i>

09:02.802 --> 09:04.903
<i>on your physics exam to
get off academic probation.</i>

09:04.937 --> 09:08.006
A 90? In physics? By tomorrow?

09:08.040 --> 09:10.008
It's our only shot at
keeping you on the team.

09:10.042 --> 09:13.678
I could maybe get a 75.
If I had a week to study.

09:13.713 --> 09:14.679
Well, you don't.

09:14.714 --> 09:16.681
Good news is not only are you blessed

09:16.716 --> 09:18.850
with an awesome field hockey coach,

09:18.884 --> 09:21.586
but he also happens to
moonlight as a physics tutor.

09:21.620 --> 09:22.921
<i>- Oh.
- Or at least I will tonight.</i>

09:22.955 --> 09:25.023
You're gonna teach me a
quarter's worth of physics

09:25.057 --> 09:26.591
in a night?

09:26.625 --> 09:28.893
Right after I try to
remember it all myself.

09:28.928 --> 09:31.663
But don't worry. We're gonna be just fine.

09:31.697 --> 09:32.897
- 'Cause you know what I got?
- Hmm?

09:32.932 --> 09:34.632
Motivation.

09:34.667 --> 09:35.800
And now so do you.

09:36.902 --> 09:38.770
See you at study hall after school.

09:38.804 --> 09:40.638
Whatever you say, Coach.

09:40.673 --> 09:43.908
I hope you understand that
this means a lot of rethinking.

09:43.943 --> 09:46.778
Hey, aren't you gonna be late?

09:46.812 --> 09:48.613
I don't have a first class.

09:48.647 --> 09:49.748
Oh.

09:49.782 --> 09:50.949
Should I make breakfast?

09:50.983 --> 09:53.651
Oh. Oh, no no no. Don't worry about it.

09:53.686 --> 09:55.854
<i>Ciao. It's always a
struggle with that woman.</i>

09:55.888 --> 09:59.758
Now she's changing the menu. Which is
the whole concept of the restaurant.

09:59.792 --> 10:01.659
Um, sorry?

10:01.694 --> 10:03.862
Uh, his business partner
in the restaurant, Christy.

10:03.896 --> 10:05.897
She wants to do Vietnamese fusion now.

10:05.931 --> 10:07.866
<i>- What does that mean?
- Exactly!</i>

10:07.900 --> 10:10.635
It was supposed to be a Parisian bistro.

10:10.669 --> 10:11.936
<i>- (Cellphone buzzes)
- Ooh.</i>

10:11.971 --> 10:13.038
Sorry, I gotta go.

10:15.007 --> 10:18.710
Don't new restaurants
sometimes do public tastings?

10:18.744 --> 10:20.712
You could do something like that.

10:20.746 --> 10:21.980
Oh, yeah.

10:22.014 --> 10:23.748
<i>Serve something from both menus.</i>

10:23.783 --> 10:25.984
- Put it to a vote.
- What about your thing?

10:26.018 --> 10:27.619
The fundraiser tonight?

10:27.653 --> 10:28.620
<i>Let me help you out.</i>

10:28.654 --> 10:30.789
My chef will bring a couple things,

10:30.823 --> 10:31.790
<i>blow everybody away.</i>

10:32.825 --> 10:33.825
I'll bring Christy.

10:33.859 --> 10:34.926
<i>She'll see how great it is.</i>

10:34.960 --> 10:36.094
That sounds fun.

10:36.128 --> 10:37.896
This is perfect.

10:37.930 --> 10:39.898
Great!

10:39.932 --> 10:40.965
Bye.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.668
Bye.

10:43.702 --> 10:45.804
<i>(Door opens, closes)</i>

10:47.139 --> 10:48.106
Perfect.

10:50.378 --> 10:51.445
<i>And then Hector's mom told us</i>

10:51.479 --> 10:52.713
that after building with us for the day,

10:52.747 --> 10:54.448
he wanted to go home and build a porch

10:54.482 --> 10:55.749
<i>for his own family.</i>

10:55.783 --> 10:57.317
Sweet.

10:57.351 --> 10:59.619
It's like he's really transformed.

10:59.654 --> 11:01.621
That's incredible.

11:01.656 --> 11:03.690
Right?

11:03.725 --> 11:05.692
I... I just...

11:05.727 --> 11:08.528
this is real ministry.

11:08.563 --> 11:10.464
And it's changing me too.

11:12.567 --> 11:14.267
That's great.

11:14.302 --> 11:16.369
I really wish that you could be here.

11:16.404 --> 11:18.438
I'm totally down for a visit.

11:18.473 --> 11:20.440
No, I mean...

11:20.475 --> 11:22.342
Be here.

11:22.376 --> 11:24.578
Like work with the kids, be a part of it.

11:24.612 --> 11:26.680
You know we talked about this.

11:26.714 --> 11:28.281
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

11:28.316 --> 11:30.617
But would you at least think about it?

11:30.651 --> 11:33.687
I mean, it's not like you
have tons going on in K.C.

11:39.427 --> 11:40.393
<i>I didn't mean it.</i>

11:43.431 --> 11:45.565
I'm sorry.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.400
I just...

11:47.435 --> 11:48.535
I really miss you.

11:51.439 --> 11:52.572
Me too.

11:58.346 --> 11:59.412
I better go.

11:59.447 --> 12:01.648
Yeah yeah, I should, uh...

12:01.682 --> 12:03.383
I should get back too.

12:07.255 --> 12:08.288
I love you.

12:09.490 --> 12:10.690
I love you too.

12:13.561 --> 12:14.628
Bye.

12:14.662 --> 12:16.563
(Silently)

12:16.597 --> 12:18.298
<i>(Doorbell rings)</i>

12:18.332 --> 12:19.699
Donny, how are you, man?!

12:19.734 --> 12:21.701
- Hey!
- Great to see you.

12:21.736 --> 12:23.570
Look at you! Fresh as a daisy.

12:23.604 --> 12:26.239
Well, I'm keeping my girlish figure.

12:26.274 --> 12:29.476
- Oh, you must be Renee.
- Thank you so much for having us.

12:29.510 --> 12:31.311
- Beautiful place.
- Thank you.

12:31.345 --> 12:32.445
- Shall we sit down?
- Hey.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.281
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

12:34.315 --> 12:35.482
Don't thank me yet.

12:35.516 --> 12:37.517
Non-alcoholic, sorry.

12:37.552 --> 12:40.720
Oh, I was hoping to catch
a glimpse of the old Donny.

12:40.755 --> 12:43.490
You know, he was quite the
wild bronco back in the day.

12:43.524 --> 12:45.625
Well, I'm happy to say this one tamed me.

12:45.660 --> 12:48.361
You make me sound like I broke your spirit.

12:48.396 --> 12:50.263
Trust me, he can still kick.

12:50.298 --> 12:51.464
Ohh. (Chuckles weakly)

12:51.499 --> 12:52.599
Hi, hi.

12:52.667 --> 12:54.501
Hi, I'm so sorry, I'm Kathryn.

12:54.535 --> 12:56.469
- You remember Donny?
- Oh, yes.

12:56.504 --> 12:59.339
Uh, I gotta admit, it was all
pretty much a blur back then.

12:59.373 --> 13:00.640
But good to see you again.

13:00.675 --> 13:03.476
I'm sure you remember
more than you think you do.

13:03.511 --> 13:05.345
Frankly, I try not to.

13:05.379 --> 13:06.613
Oh my God!

13:06.647 --> 13:08.281
You are gorgeous.

13:08.316 --> 13:10.350
Donny, how can you not remember her?

13:10.384 --> 13:12.419
So sweet. Um...

13:12.453 --> 13:14.287
(Chuckles nervously)
Dinner's not ready yet,

13:14.322 --> 13:15.322
so would you like to sit down?

13:15.356 --> 13:16.656
Oh, yeah, great.

13:16.691 --> 13:19.226
- So, tell us how you two met.
- Yeah.

13:19.260 --> 13:20.527
You're not gonna believe it.

13:20.561 --> 13:22.462
A yoga retreat.

13:22.496 --> 13:23.597
I thought I was just drying out...

13:23.631 --> 13:26.366
turns out my chakras were blocked.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.400
Mm-hmm.

13:27.435 --> 13:30.570
That sounds painful.

13:30.605 --> 13:31.605
I like yoga.

13:31.639 --> 13:33.607
<i>Yeah, um... </i>

13:33.641 --> 13:35.542
I'm gonna get started on these...

13:35.576 --> 13:37.310
Kathryn, should we, uh...

13:37.345 --> 13:38.678
Yeah. Oh, I'll... I'll
get the hors d'uvres.

13:41.382 --> 13:42.349
Nice place.

13:42.383 --> 13:43.683
Wow!

13:43.718 --> 13:46.519
This space is gorgeous.

13:46.554 --> 13:48.421
Didn't it used to be a firehouse?

13:48.456 --> 13:51.358
Yeah, the city donated
it to the clinic, though,

13:51.392 --> 13:53.593
so that you and Wes couldn't
turn them into condominiums.

13:53.628 --> 13:55.528
<i>- Nice, thanks.
- (Daphne laughs)</i>

13:55.563 --> 13:56.596
Here, let me take you on a tour.

13:56.631 --> 13:57.664
Okay.

13:57.698 --> 14:00.267
We should try the hors d'uvres.

14:03.604 --> 14:05.672
Hi. Are you Christy?

14:05.706 --> 14:07.674
I'm Regina, Angelo's wife.

14:07.708 --> 14:10.310
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

14:10.344 --> 14:11.411
Is he here?

14:11.445 --> 14:13.613
I'm guessing he's
running a little bit late.

14:15.349 --> 14:17.284
Uh, this looks wonderful.

14:17.318 --> 14:19.386
We're testing menu ideas at a free clinic.

14:19.420 --> 14:21.221
Isn't that fun?

14:21.255 --> 14:23.556
Later we'll be serving
dessert at the bus depot.

14:23.591 --> 14:25.292
Try the shrimp rolls.

14:25.326 --> 14:26.293
Oh.

14:27.395 --> 14:28.461
- Yum.
- Oh. (Chuckles)

14:33.567 --> 14:35.302
(Exhales)

14:35.336 --> 14:36.403
(Exhales sharply)

14:36.372 --> 14:38.640
Remind me next time I brag about a goldmine

14:38.674 --> 14:40.508
to make sure there's actually gold in it.

14:40.543 --> 14:42.444
Ah, honey, it's not your fault.

14:42.478 --> 14:44.479
I bet I can get him to loosen up.

14:44.513 --> 14:46.348
Give us some time after dinner.

14:46.382 --> 14:48.350
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:48.384 --> 14:50.652
I bet the wild man is still in there.

14:50.686 --> 14:53.288
Somewhere.

14:53.322 --> 14:56.191
Underneath all those chakras.

14:56.225 --> 14:57.659
Whatever they are.

14:57.693 --> 14:59.294
Too bad he dried out.

14:59.328 --> 15:02.297
Ah, tell me about it.

15:02.331 --> 15:04.299
Dry hump ale.

15:04.333 --> 15:05.600
Hey, man.

15:05.635 --> 15:08.336
Hey, are John and Kathryn here?

15:08.371 --> 15:10.438
Uh, no. They have friends
coming over for dinner.

15:10.473 --> 15:12.574
Ooh, then I have you all to myself.

15:12.608 --> 15:15.510
(Giggles)

15:15.544 --> 15:16.511
Hey.

15:16.545 --> 15:18.513
Oh, hey! Jorge, meet my mom.

15:18.547 --> 15:19.514
This is Regina.

15:19.548 --> 15:21.516
Hi... oh. Nice to meet you.

15:21.550 --> 15:23.351
Oh.

15:23.386 --> 15:25.387
Uh, sorry. Getting sick.

15:25.421 --> 15:27.489
- Oh, you too?
- I'm fighting it.

15:27.523 --> 15:29.424
Maybe you should be fighting it at home?

15:29.458 --> 15:31.626
You know, that's what I'm
starting to think, actually.

15:31.661 --> 15:34.462
What's up, party people?!

15:34.497 --> 15:37.332
(Laughs) Why are you wearing a tux?

15:37.366 --> 15:40.168
Hey, glamour is always in style.

15:41.404 --> 15:42.604
<i>Uh, Bingman.</i>

15:42.638 --> 15:45.206
- Campbell Bingman.

15:45.241 --> 15:48.176
This is my mother, Regina.

15:48.210 --> 15:51.346
Living up to your reputation, I see.

15:51.380 --> 15:52.547
You've been talking about me.

15:52.581 --> 15:54.549
We were about to take a tour.

15:54.583 --> 15:57.385
And you were about to go home.

15:57.420 --> 15:59.254
Actually, I think I could rally.

16:00.323 --> 16:01.389
Wanna go check out the bar?

16:01.424 --> 16:03.158
After you, my friend.

16:06.228 --> 16:08.563
Huh. I can see why you're having trouble

16:08.597 --> 16:10.131
making up your mind.

16:10.166 --> 16:11.299
I know.

16:11.334 --> 16:12.367
It's kind of a problem.

16:12.401 --> 16:13.601
(Both chuckle)

16:13.636 --> 16:15.370
<i>(Country rock playing softly)</i>

16:15.374 --> 16:17.075
I cannot believe you
auditioned for the musical!

16:17.109 --> 16:19.144
- Can you even sing?
- Well, wait wait.

16:19.178 --> 16:21.112
I totally go for it, and when I finish,

16:21.147 --> 16:23.281
the director goes,

16:23.316 --> 16:25.417
- "look at you!"
- (Laughs)

16:25.451 --> 16:27.252
What does that even mean?

16:27.286 --> 16:29.254
I think it means, "look at you...

16:29.288 --> 16:31.156
not getting cast in 'Man of la Mancha'!"

16:31.190 --> 16:32.424
Oh, crap, I'm sorry.

16:32.458 --> 16:35.193
I'm trying out for a
comedy improv next week.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.128
Oh, you'll be great.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.064
You're way more fearless than I'd ever be.

16:39.098 --> 16:40.398
I'm just not afraid of humiliation.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.033
It's my secret weapon.

16:42.068 --> 16:43.201
(Both chuckle)

16:43.236 --> 16:45.270
Oh, look at you!

16:45.304 --> 16:46.438
(Laughs)

16:46.472 --> 16:48.506
Whoa! Hey hey, you guys!

16:48.541 --> 16:50.242
Crazy seeing you here.

- Hi.

Do you know Mary Beth?

16:57.083 --> 16:58.450

17:01.254 --> 17:03.154
Uh, yeah. But I pretty much suck.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.357
Well, ha! You wanna see sucking at darts?

17:05.391 --> 17:07.157
- (Both laugh)
- Here, look.

17:07.193 --> 17:10.194
See, it's all in the elbow, my friend.

17:12.365 --> 17:15.333
Uh! Tank is like a total sports guru.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.402
I do dabble in the athletic arts.

17:17.435 --> 17:19.404
(Laughs) Hey, yo, Q-ball!

17:19.438 --> 17:20.405
Hang on one second.

17:20.439 --> 17:21.473
<i>What up, man?</i>

17:21.507 --> 17:23.474
- I'm gonna head out.
- Wait, no.

17:23.509 --> 17:25.042
We just got started.

17:25.077 --> 17:27.045
I'm kinda tired.

17:30.249 --> 17:31.483
Mary Beth, wait up!

17:34.520 --> 17:36.488
Why would you do that?

17:36.522 --> 17:38.089
What was the point?

17:38.124 --> 17:40.158
I'm sorry, I just...

17:40.192 --> 17:43.194
I really want you guys to like each other.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.196
I don't understand. I thought you were okay

17:45.231 --> 17:47.299
about this whole stupid luau thing.

17:47.333 --> 17:50.468
I'm not moping around all day, but
it doesn't mean I'm happy about it.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.170
Tank is not like that.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.307
He thought that party was awful too.

17:55.341 --> 17:58.376
In fact, he's the one
who called the council,

17:58.411 --> 17:59.978
to get it cancelled.

18:00.012 --> 18:02.180
Tell him congratulations.

18:02.214 --> 18:04.349
Okay, he's not perfect,
but he's a good guy.

18:04.383 --> 18:06.217
And he is nice to me.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.285
He's not gonna suddenly cheat on me

18:07.320 --> 18:08.453
with some hot medic.

18:08.487 --> 18:10.355
You of all people should get that...

18:10.389 --> 18:12.023
Ty didn't cheat on you!

18:13.459 --> 18:14.426
What?

18:14.460 --> 18:17.162
He made the whole story up.

18:17.196 --> 18:20.265
So you wouldn't have to go through
what I went through when Justin died.

18:21.300 --> 18:22.267
He lied about the whole thing.

18:22.301 --> 18:24.102
Okay?

18:24.136 --> 18:25.337
He was trying to protect you.

18:33.158 --> 18:35.192
Tell me everything right now.

18:35.226 --> 18:37.227
I don't know everything.

18:37.261 --> 18:40.464
Just that he made it up,
or he let you believe it.

18:42.433 --> 18:44.301
So he and Aida didn't...

18:45.536 --> 18:47.137
How could you sit on this?

18:47.171 --> 18:48.472
How could you keep this
from me all this time,

18:48.506 --> 18:50.340
while I was dying inside?!

18:50.374 --> 18:52.175
He made me promise not to tell you.

18:52.210 --> 18:53.176
And you listened?

18:54.345 --> 18:55.479
He thought that if he broke your heart now,

18:55.513 --> 18:57.347
it'd be better for you in the long run.

18:57.381 --> 18:59.349
In case something happened to him.

19:02.186 --> 19:05.155
That is so stupid! How could
he think that that would work?

19:05.189 --> 19:08.258
Guys go through a lot
before they head over.

19:08.292 --> 19:10.227
Maybe it was crazy.

19:10.261 --> 19:11.328
But he was thinking of you.

19:11.362 --> 19:14.264
That I know.

19:14.298 --> 19:17.300
Ty is 10 times the guy Tank will ever be.

<i>(Soft music playing)</i>

19:28.480 --> 19:31.214
So, where did it happen?

19:31.249 --> 19:33.250
In Dr. J.'s office.

19:33.284 --> 19:34.384
Right through there.

19:34.418 --> 19:36.453
I can't believe you stuck
a needle into your boss.

19:36.487 --> 19:39.489
- (Chuckles)
- Though sometimes I really wanna stick one into Wes.

19:39.524 --> 19:41.558
(Laughs)

19:41.592 --> 19:43.193
So, what was it like?

19:43.261 --> 19:46.263
Uh, it was sort of...

19:46.297 --> 19:47.430
- Popped.
- (Gasps)

19:47.465 --> 19:48.532
Like a balloon.

19:48.566 --> 19:50.600
Oh. And the air came out?

19:50.635 --> 19:52.269
Yeah, like... (Grunts)

19:52.303 --> 19:53.603
- (Hisses)
- Daphne.

19:53.638 --> 19:55.272
Ah? (Chuckles nervously)

19:55.306 --> 19:57.174
I'm glad you could make it.

19:57.208 --> 19:59.176
Hey, Dr. J. We were just talking about you.

19:59.210 --> 20:01.278
This is my mom, Regina.

20:01.312 --> 20:03.613
Ah-ha. Oh, yes. I see the resemblance.

20:03.648 --> 20:05.215
Nice to meet you.

20:05.249 --> 20:07.551
This place has been so great for Daphne.

20:07.585 --> 20:09.519
It's been great for us too.

20:10.621 --> 20:12.255
Daphne tells me you're thinking of her

20:12.290 --> 20:13.223
for a summer program.

20:13.257 --> 20:14.224
<i>Ah, yes.</i>

20:14.258 --> 20:16.193
Let's go find Dr. Petersen.

20:16.227 --> 20:18.328
Look who's here.

20:18.362 --> 20:20.330
(Gasps)

20:20.364 --> 20:21.565
There's miss Abby.

20:21.599 --> 20:23.266
<i>Dr. J: Well, hello there.</i>

20:23.301 --> 20:25.602
You look just about the
same age as my granddaughter.

20:25.636 --> 20:27.270
<i>(Dr. J. chuckles)</i>

20:27.305 --> 20:31.575
Dr. J., this is my mom's husband, Angelo

20:31.609 --> 20:34.311
and his daughter, Abby.

20:34.345 --> 20:35.445
Angelo Sorrento.

20:35.479 --> 20:37.547
Thank you so much for
letting us cater tonight.

20:37.582 --> 20:40.383
Ah, so I have you to
thank for those quiche.

20:40.418 --> 20:42.419
The chef will be so pleased you like it.

20:43.721 --> 20:45.322
Can I get you something to drink?

20:45.356 --> 20:46.690
- Water, thanks.
- Okay.

20:46.724 --> 20:48.325
We were just about to...

20:48.359 --> 20:50.193
Sorry, doctor, um...

20:50.228 --> 20:52.262
when I picked up Abby today at her dad's...

20:52.296 --> 20:55.532
her other dad... said that
her ears might be congested.

20:55.566 --> 20:57.334
And she's a little hot.

20:57.368 --> 20:59.135
Could be teething.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.337
<i>Come on into the room.</i>

21:00.371 --> 21:02.372
Can't have fun at the
party when you're congested.

21:02.406 --> 21:03.540
<i>Can you?</i>

21:07.612 --> 21:08.578
(Deeply sighs)

21:11.549 --> 21:14.417
Ahh.

21:14.452 --> 21:16.286
Come on, not bad, huh?

21:16.320 --> 21:17.520
Tastes like the real thing,

21:17.555 --> 21:20.223
minus the hangover and poor judgment.

21:20.258 --> 21:21.524
Yeah, but Donny, come on.

21:21.559 --> 21:24.160
Don't you kinda miss
the old days sometimes?

21:24.195 --> 21:26.396
Look, I know my current situation may seem

21:26.430 --> 21:29.165
a little boring next to life in the show,

21:29.200 --> 21:30.600
but I'm telling you,
since I've been with Renee,

21:30.635 --> 21:32.502
I've had more adventures than I ever had

21:32.536 --> 21:34.604
testing mattress springs
with a new girl every night.

21:34.639 --> 21:36.406
<i>Yeah, adventure's important.</i>

21:36.440 --> 21:39.509
Kathryn and I have been
through a rough patch recently.

21:39.543 --> 21:42.178
That's what we decided.

21:42.213 --> 21:43.580
Gotta do everything you can

21:43.614 --> 21:46.449
to keep things exciting.

21:46.484 --> 21:51.288
Ahh, so you called up old Donny, huh?

21:51.322 --> 21:54.457
One year, I actually planted
the bulbs upside-down.

21:54.492 --> 21:56.293
- I'm the worst.
- (Kathryn laughs)

21:56.327 --> 21:57.360
Hey, babe.

21:57.395 --> 21:59.329
What are you boys up to in here?

21:59.363 --> 22:01.498
Well, John and I were just discussing

22:01.532 --> 22:03.433
how he and Kathryn are looking to have

22:03.467 --> 22:05.302
some new adventures together.

22:05.336 --> 22:08.338
Well, I am so glad you called us.

22:08.372 --> 22:10.173
<i>(Chuckles)</i>

22:10.207 --> 22:11.341
- Uh?
- Oh, no no no.

22:11.375 --> 22:13.343
Don't worry if it's your first time.

22:13.377 --> 22:15.211
- Uh?
- Renee: We'll take it slow.

22:15.246 --> 22:16.546
Let's put some music on.

22:16.580 --> 22:18.581
Get the mood going.

22:18.616 --> 22:21.351
- Oh...
- Of course, I'm always in the mood.

22:21.385 --> 22:22.519
Just ask Donny.

22:22.553 --> 22:24.521
(Laughs)

22:24.555 --> 22:27.390
Yeah, well, that goes for both of us.

22:27.425 --> 22:29.326
(Slightly gasps, yelps)

22:29.360 --> 22:31.261
<i>(Rock music playing softly)</i>

22:31.295 --> 22:32.562
Hey, you find her? Everything okay?

22:32.596 --> 22:35.298
Yeah, uh, I... I don't know.

22:35.333 --> 22:37.200
Oh. Dude, my bad.

22:37.234 --> 22:39.202
Guess I failed on the
whole charm initiative.

22:39.236 --> 22:40.603
No no no, it's not you.

22:40.638 --> 22:41.604
Could we just catch up tomorrow?

22:41.639 --> 22:43.573
Yeah, do you want a ride?

22:43.641 --> 22:45.475
No, I'm... I'm good.

22:50.630 --> 22:52.430
Could you believe that?!

22:52.465 --> 22:53.431
I thought they were working up to pitch us

22:53.466 --> 22:54.633
one of those couples' retreats.

22:54.667 --> 22:56.601
That makes two things I
don't wanna do with them.

22:56.636 --> 22:58.703
What are we gonna do? We
can't just pretend to be

22:58.738 --> 23:00.405
looking for music all night.

23:00.439 --> 23:01.540
We've gotta find
something to kill the mood.

23:01.574 --> 23:03.341
Where's that marine band C.D.?

23:03.376 --> 23:05.310
Uh...

23:05.344 --> 23:07.379
- Roberta Flack?
- No! Good lord, no.

23:07.413 --> 23:08.547
Ooh, Abba.

23:08.581 --> 23:10.649
- Which one?
- There is an Abba

23:10.683 --> 23:12.317
you'd have group sex to?

23:12.351 --> 23:13.752
(Laughs) Good point. Put it on loud.

23:13.786 --> 23:14.786
Loud.

23:14.820 --> 23:17.455
You know what? We can't do this.

23:17.490 --> 23:18.723
They'll be as embarrassed as we are.

23:18.758 --> 23:21.393
We have to just come up with an excuse.

23:21.427 --> 23:23.395
Are you sure? 'Cause you wanted adventure,

23:23.429 --> 23:26.665
and Donny's got some
pretty nice love handles.

23:26.699 --> 23:28.466
All right, come on.

23:28.501 --> 23:29.534
(Sighs deeply)

23:29.569 --> 23:30.602
(Clears throat)

23:30.636 --> 23:31.603
Christy.

23:31.637 --> 23:32.704
Are you leaving?

23:32.738 --> 23:34.606
Yes. Could you please tell Angelo

23:34.640 --> 23:35.807
that I've wasted enough of my evening?

23:35.841 --> 23:37.409
Oh, something wrong?

23:37.443 --> 23:39.411
Look, it was nice of you

23:39.445 --> 23:41.646
to let us take over here, but I'm sorry.

23:41.681 --> 23:44.749
This is so Angelo... to take
a crucial business decision

23:44.784 --> 23:47.485
and turn it into a popularity contest.

23:47.520 --> 23:48.653
Can I weigh in?

23:48.688 --> 23:50.789
If it's about the shrimp
dumplings versus the quiche...

23:50.823 --> 23:53.391
It's about Angelo.

23:53.426 --> 23:55.660
I know sometimes it can
seem like all he cares about

23:55.695 --> 23:57.395
is making sure everybody likes him.

23:57.430 --> 23:58.630
(Sighs)

23:58.664 --> 24:00.765
But isn't that what
makes a great restaurant?

24:00.800 --> 24:02.734
Knowing how to please people?

24:02.768 --> 24:04.436
Make them feel special?

24:04.470 --> 24:06.404
Angelo could do that.

24:06.439 --> 24:09.307
He's like... he's... he's like Jay Gatsby.

24:09.342 --> 24:10.542
You don't want him doing your books,

24:10.576 --> 24:12.410
but you definitely wanna be at his parties.

24:15.448 --> 24:17.716
You know, when Angelo asked me
to meet his teenage daughter,

24:17.750 --> 24:20.485
I wasn't expecting someone
more savvy than he is.

24:22.755 --> 24:25.490
I hope he knows how lucky he
is to have you on his team.

24:31.664 --> 24:34.699
Okay, stay with me.

24:34.734 --> 24:37.769
Mass times velocity is... ?

24:37.803 --> 24:39.804
"M" times "V" equals "P"...

24:39.839 --> 24:42.540
"P" is...

24:42.575 --> 24:44.342
Mo' mass, mo' speed,

24:44.377 --> 24:45.377
mo' "mentum."

24:45.411 --> 24:47.579
Why would "P" stand for momentum?

24:47.613 --> 24:49.514
I don't know. It just does.

24:49.548 --> 24:50.615
I don't know why I'm busting my butt.

24:50.650 --> 24:52.484
There's no way I'm gonna pass.

24:52.518 --> 24:55.320
And for what? To get back on the
team that's not gonna win anyway?

24:55.354 --> 24:57.489
How 'bout to save your grades
so you can go to college?

24:57.523 --> 25:00.458
(Scoffs) Yeah, like that's gonna happen.

25:00.493 --> 25:01.726
So that's it? You're just gonna give up?

25:01.761 --> 25:03.428
I'm tired. You're tired.

25:03.462 --> 25:04.429
This isn't working.

25:04.463 --> 25:06.431
Okay, no. Sit down.

25:06.465 --> 25:08.366
<i>You are not giving up.</i>

25:08.401 --> 25:09.701
You are gonna ace this test

25:09.735 --> 25:11.603
so that we win that game next week.

25:11.637 --> 25:13.605
Because if we go an entire season

25:13.639 --> 25:15.640
without winning...

25:15.675 --> 25:17.776
(sighs)

25:17.810 --> 25:20.478
You know what my wife is doing right now?

25:20.513 --> 25:22.547
She's in Peru,

25:22.581 --> 25:25.583
teaching kids how to
read and building schools.

25:27.586 --> 25:29.688
All I have

25:29.722 --> 25:32.524
is this ragtag, strapped together,

25:32.558 --> 25:34.492
under-budgeted team.

25:34.527 --> 25:36.661
That is it.

25:36.696 --> 25:38.663
So "P" equals momentum.

25:38.698 --> 25:40.598
Can you just get that, please?

25:40.633 --> 25:43.334
Okay, man.

25:43.369 --> 25:44.669
Jeez.

25:47.540 --> 25:49.474
You're married?

25:49.508 --> 25:51.476
Yes, I am.

25:54.814 --> 25:56.414
Okay.

25:56.449 --> 25:59.751
So you know that girl that ran
into you in the second half?

25:59.785 --> 26:01.386
She was pretty tiny, right?

26:01.420 --> 26:03.488
Yeah, like an angry little elf.

26:03.522 --> 26:06.658
So, how did she knock you over?

26:06.692 --> 26:09.294
She was running at me
like her hair was on fire.

26:11.330 --> 26:12.731
She had a lot of velocity.

26:12.765 --> 26:16.401
So, what would happen if you
ran into her at the same speed?

26:16.435 --> 26:18.303
I'd flatten her like an elf pancake.

26:20.506 --> 26:21.706
I'd have more momentum.

26:21.741 --> 26:25.744
And the net force that
you hit her with would be?

26:25.778 --> 26:28.346
My mass times...

26:28.380 --> 26:29.481
acceleration?

26:30.750 --> 26:32.317
That's it.

26:35.354 --> 26:36.521
All right, let's do another one.

26:36.555 --> 26:38.423
Hey, guys.

26:38.457 --> 26:40.358
Hey, listen, uh, we got some bad news.

26:40.392 --> 26:41.760
Our daughter Bay, she drives this...

26:41.794 --> 26:43.495
Jalopy from the '60s.

26:43.529 --> 26:44.662
And it seems she's stranded.

26:44.697 --> 26:46.397
<i>Renee: Please, you don't have to.</i>

26:46.432 --> 26:47.766
It's obvious that we made a mistake.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.601
No.

26:51.604 --> 26:52.670
(Groans) I mean, yes.

26:52.705 --> 26:54.339
We didn't mean to freak you out.

26:54.373 --> 26:56.741
No, and you were so nice
to have us over for dinner.

26:56.776 --> 26:59.477
It's no big deal. It's just that...

26:59.512 --> 27:01.746
We're not into that kind of adventure.

27:01.781 --> 27:04.282
Of course.

27:04.316 --> 27:05.450
Coats.

27:05.484 --> 27:06.684
Look, it's not for everybody.

27:06.719 --> 27:08.386
We get that.

27:08.420 --> 27:09.487
No judgments.

27:09.522 --> 27:10.555
Oh, no, whatever works for you.

27:10.589 --> 27:13.324
Yeah.

27:13.359 --> 27:14.692
Well, for us...

27:14.727 --> 27:16.761
it's about intimacy, you know?

27:16.796 --> 27:19.364
I mean, look, we can brag to the guys about

27:19.398 --> 27:20.532
some legendary triple in Cleveland,

27:20.566 --> 27:22.467
and pray the wife never finds out.

27:23.536 --> 27:24.702
But you know what's better?

27:24.737 --> 27:27.438
Taking your partner with you

27:27.473 --> 27:29.774
to all those dark places.

27:29.809 --> 27:31.743
Then they're not so dark
anymore, they're just...

27:31.777 --> 27:34.379
free and beautiful.

27:34.413 --> 27:36.781
And no secrets, no shame.

27:36.816 --> 27:38.550
Just trust and love.

27:41.387 --> 27:42.387
<i>We'll see ourselves out.</i>

27:42.421 --> 27:43.688
- Yeah.
- Renee: Thank you.

27:46.425 --> 27:47.492
It's great seeing you again.

27:47.526 --> 27:48.793
Yeah yeah. Donny, great to see you.

27:48.828 --> 27:50.428
(Chuckles) Bye.

27:50.462 --> 27:51.629
- Bye.
- Bye, nice...

27:51.664 --> 27:53.798
(clears throat)

27:53.833 --> 27:56.267
(Exhales)

27:59.170 --> 28:00.831
_

28:00.839 --> 28:02.340
I know.

28:02.374 --> 28:05.610
Now I'm wondering if I'd even be with Tank

28:05.644 --> 28:06.678
if I had known.

28:07.448 --> 28:12.650
_

28:12.651 --> 28:14.319
No, but... (Sighs)

28:14.353 --> 28:15.720
What if Mary Beth's right?

28:15.754 --> 28:18.389
And he's not a good guy.

28:18.424 --> 28:19.724
Am I just kidding myself?

28:19.725 --> 28:23.720
_

28:24.763 --> 28:27.398
Only after I found out about it.

28:27.433 --> 28:29.400
He didn't do it on his own.

28:31.697 --> 28:35.487
_

28:36.508 --> 28:37.709
I'm not saying that Ty is perfect...

28:37.710 --> 28:40.408
_

28:40.409 --> 28:43.507
_

28:45.302 --> 28:46.859
_

28:48.430 --> 28:53.344
_

28:53.345 --> 28:57.746
_

28:59.598 --> 29:00.565
Thanks.

29:02.406 --> 29:04.014
_

29:05.571 --> 29:07.538
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.

29:07.573 --> 29:11.276
I was hoping to meet with
that doctor about the program.

29:11.310 --> 29:12.644
Ah, so sorry.

29:12.678 --> 29:15.546
Dr. Petersen was on call
tonight, and had to leave.

29:17.383 --> 29:19.717
Oh. Okay.

29:23.722 --> 29:24.789
Oh, there you are.

29:24.823 --> 29:27.492
Have you seen Christy?

29:27.526 --> 29:28.526
She left.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.595
She... she left?

29:30.629 --> 29:31.729
Why didn't you tell me?

29:33.365 --> 29:35.667
Because I have things to do too.

29:35.701 --> 29:37.635
This is my place, not yours.

29:37.670 --> 29:38.736
I'm sorry, I...

29:38.771 --> 29:40.638
Do you know that I have
been trying all night

29:40.673 --> 29:43.308
to meet with a doctor
about a pre-med program,

29:43.342 --> 29:44.409
and now I've missed him?

29:44.443 --> 29:45.510
And why?

29:45.544 --> 29:46.678
Because I was too busy

29:46.712 --> 29:49.514
setting up your food, talking to your boss

29:49.548 --> 29:51.516
and getting you free medical care.

29:53.352 --> 29:54.585
- I had no idea.
- Of course not!

29:54.620 --> 29:58.323
Because all you ever
think about is yourself.

30:17.893 --> 30:18.960
Hey.

30:21.296 --> 30:24.165
Why do I let him get to me?

30:24.199 --> 30:26.968
This was a big night for you.

30:30.906 --> 30:32.874
I know that you want us to be a family,

30:32.908 --> 30:35.009
and I'm trying...

30:35.043 --> 30:37.011
But I'm sorry, he's not my father.

30:37.045 --> 30:40.114
And if he wanted to be my
father, he never would have left.

30:40.148 --> 30:44.919
Sweetie, you didn't have to do this for me.

30:44.953 --> 30:46.988
I know.

30:47.022 --> 30:47.989
I thought I'd be fine.

30:49.191 --> 30:51.359
It's just that baby.

30:51.393 --> 30:54.829
Every time he tucks her into bed

30:54.863 --> 30:56.998
or brags about her, I just...

30:59.968 --> 31:01.936
I'm jealous of a nine-month-old.

31:04.339 --> 31:06.240
Of course you are.

31:06.275 --> 31:08.910
It's pathetic.

31:08.944 --> 31:10.978
When's it done?

31:11.013 --> 31:13.214
I'm tired of this.

31:13.248 --> 31:15.216
It's embarrassing.

31:16.318 --> 31:18.052
I...

31:18.086 --> 31:19.887
(sighs)

31:19.922 --> 31:21.989
I don't know if you ever get over it.

31:25.294 --> 31:28.029
The only thing you can do...

31:28.063 --> 31:30.264
is make sure it doesn't make you bitter.

31:39.207 --> 31:41.275
Maybe you didn't get much
material for your book,

31:41.310 --> 31:44.245
but our holiday year-end
letter sure got a nice boost.

31:44.279 --> 31:46.080
My mom's gonna love that.

31:46.114 --> 31:48.149
Ah, you never know what those retirees

31:48.183 --> 31:50.117
in scottsdale are getting up to.

31:50.152 --> 31:52.119
(Softly chuckles)

31:52.154 --> 31:57.258
So, uh, what was that
about a triple in Cleveland?

31:57.292 --> 31:59.860
Who knows what he was talking about?

31:59.895 --> 32:02.830
He seemed pretty sure
that you'd remember it.

32:02.864 --> 32:06.267
Probably thinking about some...

32:06.301 --> 32:08.869
incidents during my first season.

32:08.904 --> 32:10.972
What kind of incidents?

32:11.006 --> 32:13.274
This is before I even met you, okay?

32:13.308 --> 32:15.843
I can't believe it.

32:15.877 --> 32:19.013
You've been sitting on this when
I've been begging you for stories?

32:19.047 --> 32:20.948
This is not the kind of
stuff you tell your wife.

32:20.983 --> 32:21.983
All right?

32:22.017 --> 32:23.284
Especially after all the things

32:23.318 --> 32:24.852
we've been through recently.

32:24.886 --> 32:27.855
Okay, well, just... just tell me about it.

32:27.889 --> 32:28.956
Kathryn!

32:30.058 --> 32:31.158
You heard what Donny said.

32:31.193 --> 32:32.893
There shouldn't be secrets between us.

32:32.928 --> 32:34.962
I can take it.

32:37.232 --> 32:39.100
Okay. Just remember:

32:39.134 --> 32:40.134
You asked for it.

32:40.168 --> 32:42.136
- Okay.
- All right.

32:42.170 --> 32:43.871
(Inhales)

32:43.905 --> 32:47.208
So, you can imagine what a "single" is.

32:47.242 --> 32:48.976
Happens all the time, right?

32:49.011 --> 32:50.111
- Sure.
- Okay.

32:50.145 --> 32:51.946
Then there is a "double."

32:51.980 --> 32:53.914
Which is two, uh...

32:53.949 --> 32:55.983
hook-ups in one night.

32:56.018 --> 32:58.252
You mean... together?

32:58.286 --> 33:01.856
No! No no no. These are
two separate encounters.

33:01.890 --> 33:05.860
Same night, completely
independent of each other.

33:05.894 --> 33:07.862
You gotta wrap up your business with one

33:07.896 --> 33:09.130
before you move on to the next.

33:09.164 --> 33:11.866
<i>Well, I certainly hope you
wrapped up your business.</i>

33:11.900 --> 33:13.100
I can stop talking right now.

33:13.135 --> 33:15.036
No no no no no no no.

33:15.070 --> 33:16.237
Go on, go on, go on.

33:16.271 --> 33:20.207
Well, then there is the
exceedingly rare "triple."

33:21.243 --> 33:23.944
Practically unheard of.

33:23.979 --> 33:26.280
Three...

33:26.314 --> 33:28.949
in one night.

33:28.984 --> 33:29.984
How do you do that?

33:30.018 --> 33:31.886
Takes a lot of coffee.

33:33.055 --> 33:34.088
Ah.

33:34.122 --> 33:35.923
I have to hear about this.

33:38.226 --> 33:42.863
(Groans) So, it was September,

33:42.898 --> 33:46.100
and we had just beaten
the Indians in Cleveland.

33:46.134 --> 33:48.069
And I walk into this bar...

33:48.103 --> 33:51.872
I guess one of the other
guys was using his room,

33:51.907 --> 33:53.107
and when it fell out in front of me,

33:53.141 --> 33:55.209
he just kind of went with it.

33:55.243 --> 33:56.943
Uh-huh.

33:56.947 --> 33:58.848
But now he's saying it was
just a lie to protect you?

33:58.882 --> 34:00.950
(Scoffs) That's pretty good.

34:00.984 --> 34:02.752
Yeah, gotta remember that one.

34:02.786 --> 34:04.186
Mary Beth didn't want to tell me.

34:04.221 --> 34:05.921
He made her swear not to.

34:05.956 --> 34:07.890
Oh, no. He was just trying to piss you off

34:07.924 --> 34:09.091
so you wouldn't be upset if he got killed.

34:09.126 --> 34:10.092
That makes perfect sense.

34:10.127 --> 34:12.094
It's screwed up, I admit it.

34:12.129 --> 34:13.094
Yeah, but?

34:16.065 --> 34:18.100
I don't know, it...

34:18.135 --> 34:19.101
it's a lot to think about.

34:24.841 --> 34:25.775
Hmm.

34:25.809 --> 34:27.777
(Sighs deeply)

34:30.847 --> 34:31.781
So...

34:33.116 --> 34:35.184
Now what? Now you're gonna...

34:35.217 --> 34:36.252
you're gonna get back together with him?

34:36.286 --> 34:38.254
No.

34:41.824 --> 34:43.192
Emmett was talking about how
when someone's not around...

34:43.226 --> 34:45.127
(sighs) You talked to Emmett about this?

34:45.161 --> 34:47.163
Yeah, just to think it through.

34:47.197 --> 34:49.165
Wow.

34:49.199 --> 34:50.866
Wow.

34:52.135 --> 34:54.737
At least I came in third, huh?

34:54.771 --> 34:56.938
Guess I really failed
that Mary Beth sniff test.

34:56.973 --> 34:59.075
You are not on trial here.

34:59.109 --> 35:01.744
I just wanted to show her that
you're not some dumb frat guy...

35:01.778 --> 35:03.079
Oh, wow, you know what? Stop.

35:03.113 --> 35:07.016
This fraternity is about way
more than just one boneheaded idea

35:07.050 --> 35:08.884
from a couple of brothers.

35:08.919 --> 35:11.253
And I'm getting kind of
tired of defending myself.

35:11.288 --> 35:13.055
<i>(Knocks on door)</i>

35:13.090 --> 35:15.191
- Hand check.
- Seriously?

35:15.225 --> 35:16.959
I'm just messing with you, dude.

35:16.993 --> 35:19.028
Go for it. Long as the lady's on board.

35:19.062 --> 35:21.030
All right, we're kind of
in the middle of something,

35:21.064 --> 35:22.198
so if you could just...

35:22.232 --> 35:24.200
Oh oh. Sorry.

35:25.836 --> 35:28.104
Hey, you guys got any of that Tequila left?

35:28.138 --> 35:29.171
Amy's coming over later.

35:29.206 --> 35:31.006
No, I gave that to Hasley.

35:31.041 --> 35:33.909
Wait, Amy?

35:33.944 --> 35:35.244
Yeah, I know, I know.

35:35.278 --> 35:36.846
Just keep it on the D.L.

35:36.880 --> 35:38.114
I haven't quite told Karen yet.

35:38.148 --> 35:40.182
God, one of these days all these
girls are gonna get together,

35:40.217 --> 35:41.917
and pull a dogfight on you guys.

35:43.820 --> 35:44.987
<i>Pull a what?</i>

35:46.823 --> 35:47.990
What's that?

35:54.097 --> 35:56.732
Um, she probably...

35:56.767 --> 35:59.735
Um, was thinking about...
I don't... um, she... um...

35:59.770 --> 36:00.803
<i>Not cool, bro.</i>

36:00.837 --> 36:02.872
Not cool.

36:08.145 --> 36:09.845
<i>(Door closes)</i>

36:09.880 --> 36:11.781
I'm so sorry. I didn't meant to say that.

36:13.150 --> 36:14.850
(Exhales sharply) Oh, boy.

36:16.086 --> 36:18.053
That's great. Just great.

36:26.659 --> 36:28.560
<i>You wanna get out of here?</i>

36:30.430 --> 36:31.764
I was gonna bring Jorge a plate.

36:31.798 --> 36:33.465
He went home sick.

36:33.500 --> 36:34.767
<i>How about I give you a ride</i>

36:34.801 --> 36:36.535
and we grab a bite to eat after?

36:36.569 --> 36:38.537
Sure.

36:39.639 --> 36:41.373
Oh.

36:41.408 --> 36:42.841
Just give me one second.

36:42.876 --> 36:44.443
Yeah.

36:51.751 --> 36:52.718
I thought you left.

36:54.387 --> 36:55.354
I'm so sorry.

36:55.388 --> 36:57.322
No, I'm sorry.

36:57.357 --> 36:58.390
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

36:58.425 --> 37:01.460
I feel terrible. I ruined your night.

37:01.494 --> 37:02.795
No.

37:02.829 --> 37:05.564
I'm sure I can meet with
that doctor another time.

37:12.572 --> 37:14.506
Sometimes it's hard for me

37:14.541 --> 37:16.341
seeing you with Abby.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.745
I know that's stupid.

37:23.716 --> 37:25.684
The way I see it,

37:25.718 --> 37:26.752
I have three daughters.

37:31.724 --> 37:33.592
Is it too late for you to show me around?

37:34.627 --> 37:36.428
I'd love to see where you work.

37:39.399 --> 37:40.532
Sure.

37:40.567 --> 37:41.767
Come on.

37:46.773 --> 37:48.440
Don't worry.

37:48.475 --> 37:51.410
- I'll bring Jorge the food.
- Oh, you don't have to.

37:51.444 --> 37:53.645
No, man down. If I'm gonna win this thing,

37:53.680 --> 37:55.547
I'm gonna win it fair and square.

38:00.353 --> 38:01.353
Right this way.

38:08.394 --> 38:09.394
Hey.

38:09.429 --> 38:10.462
How did our exam go?

38:10.497 --> 38:11.463
Did we get our 90?

38:11.498 --> 38:13.599
Well, my teacher graded it in front of me.

38:18.671 --> 38:19.738
Good for you.

38:19.772 --> 38:21.573
I mean, hey, look at that.

38:21.608 --> 38:23.342
You thought you couldn't even clear a 75.

38:23.376 --> 38:24.376
- I know.
- (Sighs)

38:24.410 --> 38:25.644
It was a hard test too.

38:25.678 --> 38:27.746
So hard, my teacher
added a seven-point curve

38:27.780 --> 38:28.814
to everyone's score.

38:28.848 --> 38:30.516
Seriously?

38:30.550 --> 38:32.584
- Mm-hmm.
- Ha!

38:32.619 --> 38:34.553
- We're gonna kick Buckner's ass!
- Right!

38:34.587 --> 38:36.822
And you were all, "I'm
really happy for you, Sharee."

38:36.856 --> 38:38.657
It's not all about the game.

38:38.691 --> 38:40.526
Mm-hmm.

38:40.560 --> 38:43.795
Seriously, I kind of understood
physics for the first time.

38:43.830 --> 38:45.831
You were like a not-horrible teacher.

38:45.865 --> 38:47.633
Thank you.

38:47.667 --> 38:49.635
Mm-hmm. I'll see you at practice.

38:56.576 --> 38:58.644
Hey.

38:58.678 --> 39:01.313
You never came to bed.

39:01.347 --> 39:03.382
I'm almost finished with the proposal.

39:03.416 --> 39:07.386
John Kennish and his harem
was just the juice I needed.

39:07.420 --> 39:11.323
Don't worry. The names have been
changed to protect the slutty.

39:11.357 --> 39:12.624
You still okay with all that?

39:12.659 --> 39:15.727
Uh, yeah.

39:15.762 --> 39:17.729
I think so. I mean...

39:17.764 --> 39:19.665
you're not the only one with a past.

39:21.601 --> 39:22.768
I suppose that's true.

39:22.802 --> 39:24.603
I could tell you all about it.

39:24.637 --> 39:26.438
I mean, it's only fair.

39:26.472 --> 39:28.640
Maybe some other time.

39:28.675 --> 39:30.676
(Laughs)

39:30.710 --> 39:31.777
What?

39:31.811 --> 39:34.346
You don't think I can take it?

39:34.380 --> 39:35.614
No.

39:35.648 --> 39:38.617
I just think it's kinda
nice there's still things

39:38.651 --> 39:39.785
we don't know about each other.

39:39.819 --> 39:42.521
Oh, yeah.

39:42.555 --> 39:45.691
I think there are still...

39:45.725 --> 39:47.492
all kinds of things

39:47.527 --> 39:50.495
yet to discover.

39:50.530 --> 39:51.763
(Chuckles)

40:22.762 --> 40:25.564
I guess Ledarsky's blown us off yet again.

40:25.598 --> 40:27.432
We're being graced with the T.A.

40:32.605 --> 40:33.772
I'm sorry. I have to know...

40:33.806 --> 40:35.674
did I totally ruin it for you?

40:35.708 --> 40:36.842
(Sighs)

40:36.876 --> 40:38.644
I'll find out next Monday.

40:38.678 --> 40:40.445
I'm being called before the exec board

40:40.480 --> 40:42.581
to find out if I'm being
blackballed from the chapter.

40:42.615 --> 40:43.449
What?

40:43.483 --> 40:44.616
Teacher's assistant: All right, people.

40:48.254 --> 40:49.321
Can they do that?

40:49.355 --> 40:50.456
Why are you so upset?

40:50.490 --> 40:52.291
- You got what you wanted.
- No, I didn't...

40:52.325 --> 40:54.159
yeah, you had to make sure I got punished

40:54.194 --> 40:55.427
for something I didn't do.

40:55.462 --> 40:56.528
Tank.

40:56.563 --> 40:58.564
<i>Okay, folks, let's get started.</i>

40:58.598 --> 41:01.567
So, Teresa tells me you guys all read

41:01.601 --> 41:03.502
the Walter Benjamin essay.

41:03.536 --> 41:04.503
Yes?

41:04.537 --> 41:06.238
<i>Great.</i>

41:06.272 --> 41:07.439
<i>So you guys were talking about</i>

41:07.474 --> 41:09.408
<i>Italian renaissance.</i>

41:09.442 --> 41:12.211
<i>I'd say, pretty much every
piece of work you've looked at</i>

41:12.245 --> 41:15.280
<i>radiates what Benjamin's essay calls... </i>

41:15.315 --> 41:17.549
<i>♪ Down down ♪</i>

41:17.584 --> 41:20.619

41:20.653 --> 41:25.457

41:25.492 --> 41:30.462
