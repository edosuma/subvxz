03:18.122 --> 03:21.292
That's it.
100 honours, and 90 below.

03:21.376 --> 03:24.087
Nicely done, Strangways,
I have to give it to you.

03:24.170 --> 03:28.508
I must leave you for a few minutes.
Order a round on my chit, Professor.

03:28.591 --> 03:29.592
Right.

03:29.676 --> 03:32.553
Must you break off
at this time every evening?

03:32.637 --> 03:37.600
My managing director has a call put
through to me every day about this time.

03:37.684 --> 03:39.727
Hurry back.

03:39.811 --> 03:43.272
20 minutes. And don't try
doctoring any hands for me.

03:45.733 --> 03:46.859
Same again.

03:49.487 --> 03:51.572
Bless you, master.

04:06.379 --> 04:10.133
- Hurry, man.
- Get away, quick.

04:28.735 --> 04:32.405
W6N, W6N, W6N.

04:32.488 --> 04:34.949
Calling G7W.

04:35.033 --> 04:37.285
How do you hear me? Over.

04:37.952 --> 04:40.538
G7W London, G7W London.

04:40.621 --> 04:43.332
Receiving you. Over.

04:43.416 --> 04:47.211
Stand by to transmit. Wait. Out.

05:09.067 --> 05:11.152
Here.

05:41.015 --> 05:43.309
Hello, W6N. Over.

05:48.564 --> 05:51.901
Foreman of signals - urgent.

05:56.823 --> 06:00.326
Get me the Ml6 radio security control.

06:00.410 --> 06:01.536
What is it?

06:01.619 --> 06:05.832
W6N Kingston, Jamaica - broken contact
just after they came up on transmission.

06:05.915 --> 06:09.127
- Broken or faded?
- Broken. We still have the carrier wave.

06:09.210 --> 06:13.589
- On both emergency frequencies?
- No joy on either. I'm still calling.

06:13.673 --> 06:15.925
Let me know as soon as they come up.

06:20.805 --> 06:24.892
Foreman of signals, sir.
Jamaica's broken off mid-transmission.

06:24.976 --> 06:27.562
No, sir, it's not a technical fault.

06:27.645 --> 06:29.313
Yes, sir.

06:29.397 --> 06:31.274
Will you tell him, sir?

06:31.357 --> 06:32.567
Very good.

06:39.115 --> 06:42.785
- Excuse me, sir. Are you a member?
- No, I'm looking for Mr James Bond.

06:42.869 --> 06:46.706
- What name should I say?
- Just give him my card.

06:46.789 --> 06:50.126
Would you like to leave
your coat over there?

07:33.961 --> 07:37.090
The house will cover the difference?

07:49.352 --> 07:53.272
- I need another thousand.
- I admire your courage, Miss...?

07:53.356 --> 07:56.567
Trench... Sylvia Trench.

07:56.651 --> 08:00.029
I admire your luck, Mr...?

08:00.113 --> 08:03.616
Bond... James Bond.

08:03.700 --> 08:08.037
Mr Bond, I suppose you wouldn't
care to raise the limit?

08:08.121 --> 08:11.082
I have no objections.

08:14.127 --> 08:15.503
Now...

08:20.383 --> 08:25.388
- Looks like you're out to get me.
- It's an idea, at that.

08:25.471 --> 08:27.557
Eight.

08:31.310 --> 08:33.604
- Excuse me, sir.
- Thank you.

08:34.522 --> 08:36.816
AndrÃ©, I must pass the shoe.

08:36.899 --> 08:40.861
I hope you'll forgive me,
but it's most important.

08:45.199 --> 08:48.327
Have those changed, will you?

08:51.748 --> 08:56.294
Too bad you have to go.
Just as things were getting interesting.

08:56.377 --> 08:57.920
Yes.

08:58.004 --> 09:00.673
Tell me, Miss Trench,
do you play any other games?

09:00.757 --> 09:03.843
I mean, besides <i>chemin de fer?</i>.

09:03.926 --> 09:07.388
Golf, amongst other things.

09:07.472 --> 09:10.475
- Tomorrow afternoon, then.
- Tomorrow?

09:10.558 --> 09:14.437
And we could have dinner
afterwards, perhaps?

09:14.520 --> 09:17.231
Sounds tempting.

09:17.315 --> 09:21.069
May I let you know in the morning?

09:21.152 --> 09:23.613
Splendid.

09:23.696 --> 09:26.616
My number's on the card.

09:43.424 --> 09:45.802
See if he's there, will you?

09:47.762 --> 09:53.226
James, where on earth have you been?
I've been searching London for you.

09:53.309 --> 09:57.980
007 is here, sir.
He'll see you in a minute.

09:58.064 --> 10:00.149
Moneypenny.

10:00.233 --> 10:04.737
- What gives?
- Me. Given an ounce of encouragement.

10:04.821 --> 10:08.366
You never take me
to dinner looking like this.

10:08.449 --> 10:12.078
- You never take me to dinner. Period.
- I would, you know.

10:12.161 --> 10:17.250
Only M would have me court-martialled
for illegal use of government property.

10:17.333 --> 10:22.004
Flattery will get you nowhere.
But don't stop trying. Now...

10:22.088 --> 10:26.134
- What's all this to-do about?
- Strangways. It looks serious.

10:26.217 --> 10:31.264
We've been burning the air between here
and Jamaica for the last three hours.

10:31.347 --> 10:34.851
- In you go.
- Don't forget to write.

10:48.906 --> 10:50.992
Good evening, sir.

10:51.075 --> 10:55.538
It happens to be 3am.
When do you sleep, 007?

10:55.621 --> 10:58.041
Never on the firm's time, sir.

10:58.124 --> 11:00.209
Sit down.

11:04.172 --> 11:08.426
Jamaica went off the air,
in the middle of the opening procedure.

11:08.509 --> 11:12.013
We've checked up
and Strangways has disappeared.

11:12.096 --> 11:15.850
So has his secretary.
We'd only just sent her out there.

11:15.933 --> 11:18.936
Was Strangways on something special?

11:19.020 --> 11:21.397
An inquiry from the Americans.

11:21.481 --> 11:26.110
There is massive interference
with their Cape Canaveral rockets.

11:26.194 --> 11:30.114
They think it comes
from the Jamaica area.

11:30.198 --> 11:33.785
- Does "toppling" mean anything to you?
- A little.

11:33.868 --> 11:39.999
Throwing the controls of a guided missile
off balance with a radio beam.

11:40.083 --> 11:45.338
Five million dollars' worth of missile
aimed at a spot in the South Atlantic

11:45.421 --> 11:49.342
and finishing up in the Brazilian jungle
is bad enough.

11:49.425 --> 11:53.346
But now they're gonna try orbiting
a rocket round the moon.

11:53.429 --> 11:57.767
The American CIA sent a man down
to work with Strangways.

11:57.850 --> 12:00.311
A fellow by the name of Leiter.

12:00.395 --> 12:04.857
I've heard of him, but never met him.
Has he found out anything important?

12:04.941 --> 12:08.528
You'd better ask him.
You're on the 7 o'clock plane to Kingston.

12:08.611 --> 12:13.658
That gives you exactly
three hours 22 minutes.

12:13.741 --> 12:15.743
Armourer.

12:15.827 --> 12:21.082
You'll get the background papers
at the airport, in a self-destructor bag.

12:21.165 --> 12:24.127
You can study them during the flight.

12:24.210 --> 12:27.588
I want to know
what's happened to Strangways.

12:27.672 --> 12:29.549
Sir.

12:31.426 --> 12:33.928
Take off your jacket.

12:38.975 --> 12:41.477
Give me your gun.

12:44.313 --> 12:48.276
This damn Beretta again.
I've told you about this before.

12:48.359 --> 12:51.904
You tell him, for the last time.

12:52.947 --> 12:56.951
Nice and light, in a lady's handbag.

12:57.035 --> 13:01.664
- No stopping power.
- Any comments, 007?

13:01.748 --> 13:07.336
I disagree. I've used a Beretta for
ten years and never missed with it yet.

13:07.420 --> 13:11.758
But it jammed on your last job
and you spent six months in hospital.

13:11.841 --> 13:16.179
A double-O number means you're
licensed to kill, not get killed.

13:16.262 --> 13:21.601
Since I've been head of Ml7, there's
been a 40 drop in double-O casualties.

13:21.684 --> 13:25.313
I want it to stay that way.
You'll carry the Walther.

13:25.396 --> 13:29.609
Unless you'd prefer to go back
to standard intelligence duties.

13:31.069 --> 13:33.279
No, sir. I would not.

13:33.363 --> 13:36.449
Then from now on
you carry a different gun. Show him.

13:37.909 --> 13:44.374
Walther PPK: 7.65 mil with a delivery
like a brick through a plate-glass window.

13:44.457 --> 13:48.586
Takes a Brausch silencer
with little reduction in muzzle velocity.

13:48.669 --> 13:51.964
- The CIA swear by them.
- Thank you, Major Boothroyd.

13:52.048 --> 13:53.841
Thank you, sir.

13:53.925 --> 13:56.260
- Any questions, 007?
- No, sir.

13:56.344 --> 14:00.306
- All right. Best of luck.
- Thank you, sir.

14:04.268 --> 14:06.521
- 007.
- Sir?

14:06.604 --> 14:09.524
Just leave the Beretta.

14:27.125 --> 14:31.587
Miss Moneypenny, forget
the usual repartee. 007's in a hurry.

14:41.347 --> 14:43.599
Ciao.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.768
Good luck.

15:25.767 --> 15:29.187
There. Now you made me miss it.

15:29.270 --> 15:33.816
You don't miss a thing.
How did you get in here?

15:33.900 --> 15:36.402
I decided to accept your invitation.

15:38.363 --> 15:41.115
That was for tomorrow afternoon.

15:41.199 --> 15:44.118
Do you always dress this way for golf?

15:44.202 --> 15:48.373
I changed into something more
comfortable. I hope I did the right thing.

15:48.456 --> 15:52.460
You did the right thing,
but you picked the wrong moment.

15:52.543 --> 15:56.339
- I have to leave immediately.
- That's too bad.

15:57.423 --> 16:02.011
Just as things were
getting interesting again.

16:05.932 --> 16:09.519
When did you say you had to leave?

16:09.602 --> 16:11.437
Immediately.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.484
Almost immediately.

16:27.453 --> 16:30.832
Hello, New York. Your Pan Am 323
just landed Kingston, Jamaica.

16:58.484 --> 17:00.278
Taxi.

17:00.361 --> 17:03.865
- All right, then. Go ahead.
- Help yourself.

17:05.032 --> 17:08.243
- Taxi.
- Mr Bond, sir?

17:08.327 --> 17:10.163
Yes?

17:10.246 --> 17:13.290
I'm Mr Jones,
chauffeur from Government House.

17:13.374 --> 17:16.586
That's fine. We can drop
my luggage off on the way.

17:16.669 --> 17:19.714
- I want to check my reservation.
- I can do that.

17:19.797 --> 17:23.134
No, no. You just take care of the bags.

17:41.527 --> 17:43.613
- Government House?
- Yes.

17:43.696 --> 17:47.450
- Principal Secretary, please.
- Hold the line, please.

17:50.870 --> 17:54.832
- Who wants him?
- James Bond, Universal Exports.

17:54.916 --> 17:57.293
Welcome to Jamaica, Mr Bond.

17:57.377 --> 18:00.254
Yes, your head office
alerted us this morning.

18:00.338 --> 18:03.966
- Are you free for lunch at one o'clock?
- That'll suit me fine.

18:04.050 --> 18:08.554
- By the way, have you sent a car for me?
- Car? I didn't think you wanted one.

18:08.638 --> 18:11.391
Quite right.
One o'clock, then.

18:11.474 --> 18:15.353
Forgive me if I'm a few minutes late.

18:33.079 --> 18:36.666
- Where to first?
- Government House, but there's no hurry.

18:36.749 --> 18:39.877
Just take me for a ride.

19:08.990 --> 19:12.744
Do you always drive this fast?
I told you I wasn't in a hurry.

19:12.827 --> 19:17.832
Sorry, sir, but I think
there's some fellow trying to follow us.

19:21.002 --> 19:24.547
Then I suggest you try and lose them.

19:43.566 --> 19:45.693
Take the next turning on the right.

20:03.252 --> 20:07.965
Now, Mr Jones. Talk fast,
before your friend doubles back.

20:08.049 --> 20:10.385
Who are you working for?

20:10.468 --> 20:15.390
I don't know what you're talking about.
I was just sent to meet you at the airport.

20:15.473 --> 20:18.893
- But by whom?
- By...

20:18.976 --> 20:21.479
- Government House.
- I don't think so.

20:21.562 --> 20:25.733
Both hands on the wheel.
I'm a very nervous passenger.

20:26.859 --> 20:29.153
Get out. Move!

20:29.237 --> 20:32.615
Keep your hands where I can see them.

20:56.764 --> 20:59.017
Get up.

21:10.862 --> 21:14.907
- Now talk.
- All right.

21:17.285 --> 21:20.204
Let me have a cigarette.

21:33.176 --> 21:36.304
To hell with you.

21:58.242 --> 22:01.579
Sergeant, make sure he doesn't get away.

22:07.502 --> 22:10.505
Cyanide in a cigarette? Fantastic.

22:10.588 --> 22:13.383
- No less.
- Duff, what have you got for us?

22:13.466 --> 22:18.721
The car was stolen and we haven't
been able to identify the driver yet.

22:18.805 --> 22:21.015
But he surely wasn't a Kingston man.

22:21.099 --> 22:26.270
- Well, news of my arrival leaked.
- We didn't advertise it, I can assure you.

22:26.354 --> 22:31.484
Perhaps not. I got the impression
someone had been selling tickets.

22:31.567 --> 22:34.028
Anything more we can do for you?

22:34.112 --> 22:36.698
I want to meet the last people
to see Strangways.

22:36.781 --> 22:40.159
Nobody seems to have seen him
after he left our bridge four.

22:40.243 --> 22:42.495
- Who were the others?
- Professor Dent...

22:42.578 --> 22:46.457
Metallurgist, runs a test laboratory.
Respected. Clean bill.

22:46.541 --> 22:50.503
- Potter...
- Old general. Been here for ages.

22:50.586 --> 22:53.548
- We'll start with those.
- Want them brought in?

22:53.631 --> 22:58.344
- Lord, no. I want to meet them socially.
- I can introduce you at the club.

22:58.428 --> 23:03.016
- I'd like to see Strangways' place.
- I'll run you up there now.

23:15.319 --> 23:17.363
Go on in.

23:22.410 --> 23:25.079
That's her blood patch.

23:25.163 --> 23:29.751
- They've grouped it as O Rh positive.
- That's her group, all right.

23:39.510 --> 23:42.555
The set was still switched on
when we came round.

23:42.638 --> 23:45.725
We tried to get through,
but it was dead the other end.

23:45.808 --> 23:51.272
And it'll stay dead. All frequencies are
changed immediately security's broken.

23:58.196 --> 24:01.866
Receipt from Dent Laboratories.

24:01.949 --> 24:06.371
- Geology a hobby of Strangways?
- Not that I know of, no.

24:12.752 --> 24:15.880
Who's the man with Strangways?

24:17.799 --> 24:21.094
- One of the local fishermen.
- He drove the car that tailed me.

24:21.177 --> 24:26.057
Is that so? That gives us something
to work on. I'll have him checked.

24:26.140 --> 24:31.062
You do that. I want to change
before I meet Pleydell-Smith at the club.

24:37.193 --> 24:41.781
One medium-dry vodka martini.
Mixed like you said, and not stirred.

24:41.864 --> 24:45.243
- Anything else, sir?
- No, that's all.

26:03.363 --> 26:06.657
Curious, old Strangways
just vanishing like that.

26:06.741 --> 26:11.871
Or is it? <i>Cherchez la femme.</i>
His secretary was very nice indeed.

26:11.954 --> 26:15.458
- Did you know her?
- I've seen her around.

26:15.541 --> 26:19.087
None of you can throw any light
on what happened to him?

26:19.170 --> 26:22.632
His conversation? Any hint?

26:22.715 --> 26:26.344
I never heard him talk about anything
but big-game fishing and bridge.

26:26.427 --> 26:31.182
He got the fishing bug three weeks ago.
He's been out practically every day since.

26:31.265 --> 26:33.434
It must have cost him something.

26:33.518 --> 26:37.939
These fishermen ask the earth to charter,
and Quarrel's the most expensive of all.

26:38.022 --> 26:40.149
- Quarrel?
- A Cayman Islander.

26:40.233 --> 26:42.860
- He keeps a boat in the harbour.
- I see.

26:49.450 --> 26:51.327
Thank you.

26:52.662 --> 26:55.164
Excuse me.
Where do I find Quarrel?

26:55.248 --> 26:56.416
He him.

27:08.261 --> 27:10.930
Your name Quarrel?

27:11.014 --> 27:12.682
Maybe.

27:12.765 --> 27:16.936
I'm a friend of Commander Strangways.

27:18.730 --> 27:23.234
Ain't that nice?
I like people who's friends of people.

27:23.317 --> 27:27.905
I thought you might be able
to tell me what happened to him.

27:27.989 --> 27:30.908
As far as I know, nothing happened.

27:30.992 --> 27:33.911
Unless you know different.

27:34.746 --> 27:37.999
Where did you take him in your boat?

27:38.082 --> 27:42.879
You see that, captain?
That there's the Caribbean.

27:42.962 --> 27:45.840
That's where. Fishing.

27:45.923 --> 27:49.635
I'm interested in fishing.
I'd like to charter your boat.

27:49.719 --> 27:51.888
It's not for hire.

27:51.971 --> 27:54.432
Seems I came to the wrong address.

27:54.515 --> 27:56.309
That's all right.

27:56.392 --> 28:00.563
If you'll excuse me,
I got business to attend to.

28:33.179 --> 28:35.682
Pussfeller.

28:55.284 --> 28:59.455
Well, if it ain't my friend
what gets addresses mixed.

28:59.539 --> 29:02.667
You got the right one this time
if you likes good eating.

29:02.750 --> 29:06.254
I do, if the conversation matches it.

29:06.337 --> 29:11.634
Back at the boat too public.
In there it different.

29:11.718 --> 29:13.511
After you.

29:13.594 --> 29:15.680
Sure thing.

29:19.684 --> 29:25.148
- Hey, man! You see we get some privacy.
- Nothing but, Quarrel.

29:31.988 --> 29:35.074
- Take a seat.
- I'm fine.

29:35.158 --> 29:39.620
OK, mister.
Supposin' you start the conversation.

29:39.704 --> 29:41.789
How's about it?

29:50.715 --> 29:56.471
Ain't no use you struggling.
Pussfeller wrestles alligators.

30:02.185 --> 30:04.979
Right! Up slowly and face that wall.

30:14.447 --> 30:16.532
Hold it.

30:21.245 --> 30:24.832
Gently, bud, gently.
Let's not get excited.

30:29.545 --> 30:32.048
Frisk him.

30:43.851 --> 30:45.603
Nothing.

30:46.646 --> 30:49.732
Interesting.
Where were you measured for this?

30:49.816 --> 30:51.859
My tailor, Savile Row.

30:51.943 --> 30:55.196
Is that so? Mine's a guy in Washington.

30:55.279 --> 30:58.616
Felix Leiter.
Central Intelligence Agency.

30:58.700 --> 31:02.995
- You must be James Bond.
- You mean we're fighting the same war?

31:03.079 --> 31:09.002
When I saw you leave the airport with
the opposition, I figured I must be wrong.

31:09.085 --> 31:11.129
This is Quarrel.

31:11.212 --> 31:14.632
- No hard feelings, I hope?
- Only a sore hand. Glad to know you.

31:14.716 --> 31:19.095
- Pussfeller owns the place.
- I hope he cooks better than he fights.

31:19.178 --> 31:21.806
Nobody died from my cooking - yet.

31:58.968 --> 32:01.763
There you are.
Cape Canaveral is screaming.

32:01.846 --> 32:05.266
They don't want anything to go wrong
with this moon rocket launch.

32:05.350 --> 32:08.853
Yet Strangways didn't think
the interference came from here?

32:08.936 --> 32:13.858
- I suppose you cased the joint?
- I checked unofficially.

32:13.941 --> 32:17.028
You limeys can be touchy
about trespassing.

32:17.111 --> 32:19.864
Strangways and Quarrel
checked the islands.

32:19.947 --> 32:22.450
You found nothing?
Where did you look?

32:22.533 --> 32:28.122
Just about everywhere.
Fire Island, Crab Key, Morgan's Reef.

32:28.206 --> 32:31.959
- Checked them all thoroughly?
- All except Crab Key. We had no right.

32:32.043 --> 32:35.213
- Why not?
- It belongs to a Chinese...

32:37.799 --> 32:40.885
Get her, Quarrel, and the camera.

32:44.639 --> 32:47.141
Evening, missis.

32:48.685 --> 32:50.687
You're hurting.

32:50.770 --> 32:54.732
The captain wants you
to have a drink with us.

32:54.816 --> 32:58.861
- You're hurting me.
- You can't mean it.

33:06.994 --> 33:09.122
Good evening.

33:13.876 --> 33:18.673
- Why do you want another picture of me?
- I only got your hat at the airport.

33:18.756 --> 33:22.510
- Tell this ape to let me go.
- Why do you want a picture at all?

33:22.593 --> 33:26.055
Because that's the way I earn my living.

33:26.139 --> 33:28.516
Who pays you?

33:28.599 --> 33:31.519
<i>The Daily Gleaner.</i>

33:31.602 --> 33:34.439
Pussfeller. Pussfeller.

33:36.566 --> 33:39.360
- Anything I can do?
- Ever seen this girl before?

33:39.444 --> 33:44.407
She come here sometimes.
You want for me to get rid of her?

33:44.490 --> 33:49.078
No. Just ring the <i>Gleaner.</i> Find out
if they sent a photographer here tonight.

33:50.204 --> 33:52.332
They didn't send me. I work freelance.

33:52.415 --> 33:55.043
Freelance? For whom?

33:55.793 --> 33:57.086
You...

33:58.546 --> 34:01.466
Tell us and he'll stop.

34:07.096 --> 34:11.976
We don't get nothing out of this gal.
You want me to break her arm?

34:12.060 --> 34:14.562
Another time.

34:17.857 --> 34:21.610
The second time nothing's come out.
Give her her arm back.

34:22.570 --> 34:25.031
Run along, freelance.

34:25.114 --> 34:29.118
You'll be sorry.
You'll all be sorry, you rats.

34:33.331 --> 34:38.418
One takes cyanide, another would have
had her arm broken. Neither would talk.

34:38.503 --> 34:43.341
- Who puts that sort of scare into people?
- I think maybe we'd better find out fast.

34:43.424 --> 34:46.302
You were talking about Crab Key?
Why can't we go there?

34:46.386 --> 34:50.598
It belongs to a Chinese character.
He won't allow anyone to land.

34:50.681 --> 34:53.851
I had our naval reconnaissance planes
take a look.

34:53.935 --> 34:58.564
They found nothing but a bauxite mine.
Low-scan CH radar setup.

34:58.648 --> 35:03.444
- There's nothing illegal about that.
- Crab Key scares me plenty.

35:03.528 --> 35:06.531
Friends of mine went out
there once after seashells.

35:06.614 --> 35:09.033
Only trouble, they never came back again.

35:09.117 --> 35:11.619
The local fishermen won't go near it.

35:11.703 --> 35:13.955
Strangways and me, we slip in at night.

35:14.038 --> 35:17.834
He take some samples, we came straight
back. Don't do to hang about there.

35:17.917 --> 35:23.089
- What kind of samples?
- Bits of rock, sand, water.

35:24.173 --> 35:26.175
I see.

35:26.259 --> 35:28.761
Crab Key begins to interest me.

35:28.845 --> 35:31.514
What else do we know
about this Chinese gentleman?

35:31.597 --> 35:34.642
Nothing much. Except his name.

35:34.726 --> 35:36.769
Dr No.

36:11.387 --> 36:15.016
- I'd like to see Professor Dent.
- Have you an appointment?

36:15.099 --> 36:17.852
James Bond.
We met yesterday at the club.

36:17.935 --> 36:21.481
Very well.
He's somewhere in the lab.

36:21.564 --> 36:23.649
Is Professor Dent there?

36:26.110 --> 36:27.820
Oh, never mind.

36:28.654 --> 36:30.990
Morning, Professor.

36:31.074 --> 36:33.368
Mr Bond.
Anything I can do for you?

36:33.451 --> 36:37.580
Yes. I came across this
in Strangways' office.

36:37.664 --> 36:39.832
Your receipt.

36:39.916 --> 36:44.921
- Yes, that's right.
- Can you tell me anything about it?

36:45.004 --> 36:49.592
Poor old Strangways.
Bit of a bug of his, this amateur geology.

36:49.676 --> 36:53.971
He brought some samples in for testing,
convinced they were valuable.

36:54.055 --> 36:55.807
Were they?

36:55.890 --> 36:59.018
Of course not.
Just low-grade iron pyrites.

36:59.102 --> 37:03.564
- Can I see them?
- I threw 'em away.

37:04.857 --> 37:08.486
- Do you know where he found them?
- No, he didn't say.

37:09.362 --> 37:13.324
- Crab Key, perhaps?
- Definitely not.

37:13.408 --> 37:17.704
- Why so certain?
- Not geologically possible.

37:17.787 --> 37:21.624
Thank you, Professor. It's very kind of you
to spare me your time.

37:21.708 --> 37:23.876
You're very welcome, Mr Bond.

37:23.960 --> 37:26.462
Professor...

37:28.589 --> 37:31.092
Allow me.

37:34.095 --> 37:36.180
Morning.

37:55.116 --> 37:58.244
- I have to get to Crab Key.
- You know the procedure.

37:58.328 --> 38:01.622
There's no time for that.
I'll take responsibility.

38:01.706 --> 38:04.834
- Man, I hope you know what you're doing.
- Come on.

38:48.836 --> 38:52.382
- I radioed. They're expecting me.
- Go ahead.

39:37.427 --> 39:39.512
Sit down.

39:47.228 --> 39:51.524
Why have you disobeyed
my strictest rule and come in daylight?

39:51.607 --> 39:55.069
I had to.
Bond came to see me this morning.

39:55.153 --> 40:01.367
Yes, I know. I gave orders that he should
be killed. Why is he still alive?

40:01.451 --> 40:04.829
- Our attempts failed.
- Your attempts failed.

40:04.912 --> 40:09.417
I do not like failure. You are not
going to fail me again, Professor.

40:09.500 --> 40:12.587
No. I came to warn you.

40:12.670 --> 40:16.090
- Warn me?
- Tell you.

40:16.174 --> 40:19.844
Bond has discovered
those rock samples came from Crab Key.

40:19.927 --> 40:22.305
He's not a fool.
He's sure to come out here.

40:22.388 --> 40:26.476
I hope not. If he does,
I shall hold you responsible.

40:26.559 --> 40:29.645
Do I make myself clear?

40:29.729 --> 40:32.065
Yes, quite clear.

40:33.107 --> 40:36.027
Go to the table.

40:47.580 --> 40:50.958
You see what is in the cage?

40:52.001 --> 40:54.504
Pick it up.

40:55.963 --> 40:58.466
Pick it up.

41:05.723 --> 41:07.809
Tonight.

41:23.157 --> 41:26.911
- I'd like to send a cable.
- Yes, of course.

41:26.995 --> 41:33.501
The car you ordered has been delivered.
It's in number five parking lot.

41:33.584 --> 41:37.130
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night, Mr Bond.

44:40.646 --> 44:42.482
- Morning, Pleydell-Smith.
- Bond.

44:42.565 --> 44:48.279
Sorry to trouble you so early. I need
all you have on Dr No and Crab Key.

44:48.363 --> 44:52.575
Miss Taro, bring me the files on Dr No.

44:52.659 --> 44:56.829
- What do you know about this island?
- Not much, except there's a bauxite mine.

44:56.913 --> 44:59.666
Dr No runs it like a concentration camp.

44:59.749 --> 45:03.294
I've heard rumours,
but no one's complained officially.

45:04.712 --> 45:08.716
- Miss Taro, just leave them here.
- We can't find them anywhere.

45:08.800 --> 45:14.555
- What do you mean? Who had them last?
- Commander Strangways. Both files.

45:14.639 --> 45:16.724
All right, Miss Taro.

45:17.725 --> 45:20.853
Damn nuisance,
their disappearing like that.

45:20.937 --> 45:23.439
On the contrary.

45:23.523 --> 45:26.609
I'd have been surprised if they hadn't.

45:26.693 --> 45:31.906
By the way, that came for you
from London, in the diplomatic pouch.

45:36.661 --> 45:39.580
A present from home.

45:42.250 --> 45:45.169
Can I get out that way?

45:57.974 --> 46:01.769
That's a naughty habit -
listening at keyholes.

46:01.853 --> 46:04.856
I wasn't listening.
I was looking for those files.

46:04.939 --> 46:07.692
Anything that can't be found,
I get the blame.

46:07.775 --> 46:11.320
Forget it.
It's not very important anyhow.

46:11.404 --> 46:14.991
I'd hate to think you were spending
all afternoon looking for them.

46:15.074 --> 46:17.452
No. I have the afternoon off.

46:17.535 --> 46:22.123
There's a coincidence. So have I.
Why don't you show me round the island?

46:22.206 --> 46:25.710
What should I say to an invitation
from a strange gentleman?

46:25.793 --> 46:27.670
You should say yes.

46:27.754 --> 46:30.173
I should say maybe.

46:30.256 --> 46:33.968
Three o'clock at my hotel... maybe?

46:35.011 --> 46:37.930
- Yes, maybe.
- Good.

46:49.776 --> 46:52.904
The luminous dial activates it.
Hold this.

46:52.987 --> 46:56.908
Where exactly did
Strangways place those samples?

46:56.991 --> 46:59.911
- About where your feet is, sir.
- Good.

47:06.084 --> 47:07.960
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

47:08.044 --> 47:12.215
- Lose something?
- Take a look at this Geiger reading.

47:15.009 --> 47:19.514
Those samples Strangways brought back
from Crab Key were radioactive.

47:19.597 --> 47:23.393
Yet Professor Dent told me they were
worthless chunks of iron ore.

47:23.476 --> 47:27.271
- He's either a bad professor or a poor liar.
- I intend to find out which.

47:27.355 --> 47:30.358
Quarrel, how soon can you
get us over to Crab Key?

47:30.441 --> 47:34.028
Well, it's like this here, captain.

47:34.112 --> 47:37.240
Strangways, he done take samples
of all the islands.

47:37.323 --> 47:41.703
- We could check the nearest ones first.
- No. It's Crab Key I'm interested in.

47:41.786 --> 47:45.498
I done take the commander there.
We got away without trouble.

47:45.581 --> 47:49.085
It don't do for a man
to tempt providence too often.

47:49.168 --> 47:52.213
- You see, there's a dragon.
- What?

47:52.296 --> 47:57.010
Native superstition.
Started by Dr No, probably.

47:57.093 --> 47:59.637
All right, Quarrel. We won't force you.

47:59.721 --> 48:03.307
Leiter and I will go after dark,
if you'll give us directions.

48:03.391 --> 48:09.772
I gets my navigational directions
from my nose, my ears - my instincts.

48:10.815 --> 48:13.943
Anyway, I'll be here about seven.

48:15.236 --> 48:17.030
Fine.

48:23.703 --> 48:26.539
Mr Bond, there's
a telephone message for you.

48:26.622 --> 48:29.751
Johnny, what have you done with it?

48:52.273 --> 48:53.941
Hello?

48:54.025 --> 48:56.069
Mr Bond.

48:56.152 --> 49:00.698
I was thinking, why don't you
collect me at my apartment?

49:00.782 --> 49:05.995
It's lovely up here in the mountains.
Nice and cool.

49:06.079 --> 49:08.039
All right.

49:08.122 --> 49:11.292
You leave the Port Royal road
out of Kingston,

49:11.376 --> 49:16.214
then along the Windward Road,
until you get to the cement factory.

49:16.297 --> 49:18.466
Then you turn left.

49:18.549 --> 49:22.595
Follow the road up the hill,
down the other side,

49:22.679 --> 49:25.890
then two miles further on, on the left,

49:25.973 --> 49:29.352
Magenta Drive 239.

49:31.020 --> 49:34.148
I'll be waiting for you.

51:13.373 --> 51:16.334
How did it happen?

51:16.417 --> 51:20.296
I think they were
on their way to a funeral.

51:40.024 --> 51:42.777
Just a minute.

51:51.995 --> 51:55.456
- You did invite me, remember?
- Of course.

51:55.540 --> 51:59.168
I just didn't expect you here so soon.

51:59.836 --> 52:02.338
Yes, come in.

52:05.967 --> 52:08.678
I'll just go and put some clothes on.

52:08.761 --> 52:12.098
Don't go to any trouble on my account.

52:13.307 --> 52:14.976
Please.

52:15.059 --> 52:19.439
Forgive me. I thought I was
invited up here to admire the view.

52:23.651 --> 52:26.988
I feel one of us should answer it.

52:33.911 --> 52:35.038
Hello.

52:35.121 --> 52:37.832
Yes. I know, he's here now.

52:42.462 --> 52:45.298
I don't know what happened.

52:45.381 --> 52:50.345
Right. I'll try and keep him here
for a couple of hours.

52:50.428 --> 52:54.807
I'll have to go now.
I'll call you later.

52:58.353 --> 53:01.230
You believe in living dangerously.
I can see that.

53:01.314 --> 53:03.191
What do you mean?

53:03.274 --> 53:07.445
Sitting around with wet hair,
you'll die of pneumonia.

53:10.031 --> 53:13.117
- It's rather beautiful.
- Thank you.

53:13.201 --> 53:16.204
- Do you always wear it up?
- Don't you like it that way?

53:16.287 --> 53:18.206
Yes, very much.

53:18.289 --> 53:23.044
With your sort of face, it's wonderful.

53:23.127 --> 53:28.007
- What's going on behind my back?
- Nothing.

53:28.091 --> 53:31.427
Look. No hands.

53:46.192 --> 53:49.737
I'm hungry. Let's go out and eat.

53:49.821 --> 53:55.493
- I'll make you a Chinese dinner here.
- I'm feeling Italian and musical.

53:55.576 --> 53:59.247
- Let's go to the Blue Mountain Grill.
- I'd rather stay here.

53:59.330 --> 54:02.291
It's more fun... alone.

54:02.375 --> 54:05.586
Yes, but I don't want you
getting dishpan hands.

54:05.670 --> 54:10.258
- I like cooking.
- Forget it. May I use your phone?

54:12.468 --> 54:14.554
Who are you ringing?

54:14.637 --> 54:16.723
Taxi.

54:17.724 --> 54:23.312
James Bond here. Can I have
a car sent to 2171 Magenta Drive?

54:23.396 --> 54:26.524
As soon as you can, please.
Thank you.

54:27.692 --> 54:31.946
- I thought you came by car.
- Damn thing wouldn't start.

54:32.030 --> 54:34.532
That explains...

54:35.283 --> 54:36.993
Explains what?

54:37.076 --> 54:39.620
Why you need a taxi.

54:39.704 --> 54:42.081
Why I need a taxi?

54:42.165 --> 54:45.293
Careful - my nail varnish.

54:55.094 --> 54:58.848
- The lights.
- No, I always leave them on.

55:03.019 --> 55:06.731
- What's going on?
- Book her, Superintendent, will you?

55:06.814 --> 55:08.900
And...

55:08.983 --> 55:12.654
be careful of her nail varnish.

57:36.673 --> 57:39.384
Drop it, Professor, and behind you.

57:43.763 --> 57:48.559
It's funny, I thought you'd turn up
sooner or later. Sit down.

57:50.687 --> 57:52.772
The girl talked?

57:52.855 --> 57:54.691
But of course.

57:54.774 --> 57:57.568
I was suspicious
at the Queens Club anyhow.

57:57.652 --> 58:01.322
You were the only one
who'd seen Strangways' new secretary.

58:02.657 --> 58:04.742
And then later at the lab,

58:04.826 --> 58:10.957
you made no reference to the fact that
Strangways' samples were radioactive.

58:11.040 --> 58:12.959
Very clever, Mr Bond.

58:14.210 --> 58:18.756
You're up against more than you know. If
you shoot me, you'll end like Strangways.

58:18.840 --> 58:22.885
- And you killed him?
- He was killed, but never mind how.

58:22.969 --> 58:25.763
Who are you working for, Professor?

58:25.847 --> 58:29.684
You might as well know, as you won't live.
I'm working for...

58:31.978 --> 58:37.233
It's a Smith & Wesson.
And you've had your six.

58:54.208 --> 58:56.836
- Better late than never.
- Everything ready?

58:56.919 --> 59:00.048
Yeah, for the last two hours.

59:01.549 --> 59:03.760
Don't worry, Quarrel. It'll be fine.

59:03.843 --> 59:08.181
Bottom part of where my belly
used to be tells me different.

59:08.264 --> 59:11.100
For me, Crab Key will be
a gentle relaxation.

59:11.184 --> 59:15.063
- From what? Dames?
- No, from being a clay pigeon.

59:45.885 --> 59:50.890
This is as far as we go with the engine.
Make with paddle and wind from now on.

59:50.973 --> 59:53.059
OK.

59:55.895 --> 59:59.607
- Let me go with you.
- No, we settled that. It's my beat.

59:59.691 --> 01:00:02.819
But it's my head in the noose
if anything gets unstuck.

01:00:02.902 --> 01:00:06.072
Canaveral can only wait
48 hours for that moonshot.

01:00:06.155 --> 01:00:11.869
If we're not back in 12, then it's your beat.
You'd better bring your marines with you.

01:00:11.953 --> 01:00:16.124
Quarrel, if you see a dragon, get in first
and breathe on him, you hear?

01:00:16.207 --> 01:00:19.794
With all that rum in you, he'll die happy.

01:00:46.821 --> 01:00:50.992
Better drop the sail
in case their radar's on scan.

01:00:59.167 --> 01:01:02.503
Hard about, captain. Now!

01:01:30.031 --> 01:01:32.408
Cover it up.

01:01:32.492 --> 01:01:37.830
We'd better get some sleep before
it gets light. I'll be down this end.

01:02:55.325 --> 01:02:57.827
Who is that?

01:03:03.082 --> 01:03:07.295
It's all right. I'm not supposed
to be here, either. I take it you're not.

01:03:07.378 --> 01:03:12.008
- Are you alone?
- What are you doing? Looking for shells?

01:03:12.091 --> 01:03:16.137
- No, I'm just looking.
- Stay where you are.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:23.186
- I promise I won't steal your shells.
- I promise you you won't, either.

01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:28.316
- Stay where you are.
- My intentions are strictly honourable.

01:03:48.419 --> 01:03:50.797
What's your name?

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:53.341
- Ryder.
- Ryder what?

01:03:53.424 --> 01:03:55.551
Honey Ryder.

01:03:56.594 --> 01:04:01.391
- What's so funny about it?
- Nothing. It's a very pretty name.

01:04:02.934 --> 01:04:06.896
- What's your name?
- James.

01:04:08.481 --> 01:04:11.609
Honey, did you use your sail
all the way up to the reef here?

01:04:11.693 --> 01:04:13.778
Of course. I always do.

01:04:13.861 --> 01:04:16.823
Then they'll know we're here.
They have radar.

01:04:16.906 --> 01:04:22.495
My boat is too small to be noticed.
And I often come here to get the shells.

01:04:22.578 --> 01:04:25.873
At first they tried to catch me,
but they couldn't.

01:04:25.957 --> 01:04:30.336
- Now they don't bother any more.
- They will this time.

01:04:32.255 --> 01:04:35.633
- Don't bother with those now.
- Don't bother?

01:04:35.717 --> 01:04:37.802
Are they valuable?

01:04:37.885 --> 01:04:42.473
This one is worth $50 in Miami. 50.

01:04:45.476 --> 01:04:48.187
You promise you won't tell anyone?

01:04:48.271 --> 01:04:49.939
I promise.

01:04:50.023 --> 01:04:53.401
- Hey, come and take a look.
- It's all right. He's with me.

01:04:54.235 --> 01:04:57.363
Captain, what do you think of that?

01:04:59.324 --> 01:05:01.409
What's the matter?

01:05:05.163 --> 01:05:09.334
That's a high-powered boat.
Take some cover. Come on.

01:05:36.903 --> 01:05:39.405
They're here all right.

01:05:39.489 --> 01:05:42.492
OK, folks!
Come out and you won't get hurt.

01:05:43.951 --> 01:05:48.623
Stand up and show yourselves
or I'll be forced to open fire.

01:05:51.084 --> 01:05:54.545
Come on out.
We know you're there.

01:05:54.629 --> 01:05:59.342
We've been expecting you. Walk out
with your hands up and you'll be OK.

01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:04.305
- This is your last chance.
- He's bluffing. Keep your head down.

01:06:05.056 --> 01:06:08.976
All right! You've been warned. This is it.

01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:12.563
Lie still. It won't last long.
They don't really know we're here.

01:06:12.647 --> 01:06:14.732
Fire!

01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:29.664
Are you coming out?

01:06:29.747 --> 01:06:31.791
All right, then.

01:06:31.874 --> 01:06:33.960
We'll be back.

01:06:34.043 --> 01:06:37.630
We'll be back with the dogs.
Full speed ahead.

01:07:00.611 --> 01:07:02.655
I warned you about this place.

01:07:02.739 --> 01:07:05.408
That was a machine gun, not a dragon.

01:07:05.491 --> 01:07:07.744
- There's a dragon here, too.
- She's right.

01:07:07.827 --> 01:07:10.621
- You've seen it?
- Yes, I have.

01:07:10.705 --> 01:07:17.045
He had two glaring eyes, a short tail,
pointed wings, and was breathing fire.

01:07:17.128 --> 01:07:19.213
You don't believe me, do you?

01:07:19.297 --> 01:07:23.634
Little gal, I does. I tell you, Mr Bond,
let's get the hell outta here.

01:07:23.718 --> 01:07:27.347
Listen, both of you.
There are no such things as dragons.

01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:32.185
You saw something that looked like one.
I'm trying to think what it was.

01:07:32.268 --> 01:07:37.857
How do you know there aren't?
Did you ever see a mongoose dance?

01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:41.527
Or a scorpion with sunstroke
sting itself to death?

01:07:41.611 --> 01:07:44.739
Or a praying mantis
eat her husband after making love?

01:07:44.822 --> 01:07:47.825
- I hate to admit it, but I haven't.
- Well, I have.

01:07:47.909 --> 01:07:50.328
She's right.

01:07:50.411 --> 01:07:54.123
All right, they've gone.
Honey, you're getting out of here.

01:07:54.207 --> 01:07:57.377
I'm getting out when I'm ready,
and that's never in daylight.

01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:02.423
This time you are, and fast.
Where's your boat?

01:08:02.507 --> 01:08:05.426
Fetch my shoes.

01:08:12.058 --> 01:08:16.437
Look! Look what they've done.
It's all your fault.

01:08:17.897 --> 01:08:22.402
I'm sorry. I'll get you a new boat
when we get back to Kingston.

01:08:22.484 --> 01:08:25.529
What are we going to do with her now?

01:08:25.613 --> 01:08:28.783
If you like, I know
a good place where we can hide.

01:08:28.866 --> 01:08:33.246
That'll do for a start.
Leave the things you don't need. Quick!

01:08:56.728 --> 01:09:02.274
- Must we come this way?
- Yes. It throws the dogs off the scent.

01:09:02.358 --> 01:09:06.154
- Damn mosquitoes.
- Rub water all over yourself.

01:09:06.237 --> 01:09:09.365
It's the salt they're after.

01:09:14.203 --> 01:09:16.956
Quick! They's coming, across there.

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:24.130
Quarrel, cut some of those reeds.
Give me the knife.

01:09:24.212 --> 01:09:26.090
Over there.

01:09:37.518 --> 01:09:40.188
They're coming closer.

01:09:40.270 --> 01:09:42.357
- Keep quiet.
- Something's biting me.

01:09:42.439 --> 01:09:45.609
If you disturb the mud,
they'll know we're here. Get down.

01:10:10.176 --> 01:10:12.387
Looks like they're onto something.

01:10:57.473 --> 01:10:59.934
Get down.

01:11:36.679 --> 01:11:39.557
- Why?
- Because I had to.

01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:43.227
He sure knew his business,
trailing us after we let the others pass.

01:11:43.311 --> 01:11:46.064
We must get out of here.
Where is this hiding place?

01:11:46.147 --> 01:11:48.441
Up there.

01:11:49.984 --> 01:11:51.194
Come on.

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:05.249
You smell nicer already.

01:12:05.333 --> 01:12:07.543
Thank you.

01:12:07.627 --> 01:12:10.338
Mr Bond, quick!

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:15.343
- What is it now?
- Look at these.

01:12:18.096 --> 01:12:20.848
Those are dragon tracks.

01:12:20.932 --> 01:12:23.726
That's where he breathed.

01:12:23.810 --> 01:12:29.232
You ought to get some rest if you want to.
I stay out here on watch.

01:12:29.315 --> 01:12:34.278
- In case he comes a-Iooking for us.
- Right. I'll take the second watch.

01:12:35.321 --> 01:12:38.449
We'll be out of here by midnight.

01:12:40.410 --> 01:12:43.621
I never met a detective before.

01:12:44.664 --> 01:12:48.001
- Are you going to arrest Dr No?
- Someone is.

01:12:48.084 --> 01:12:51.587
We can't have him trying
to kill everyone who comes here.

01:12:51.671 --> 01:12:54.215
He doesn't just try.

01:12:54.298 --> 01:12:57.885
- I'm pretty sure he killed my father.
- What do you mean by that?

01:12:57.969 --> 01:13:01.848
You see, my father
was a marine zoologist.

01:13:01.931 --> 01:13:05.518
We came to the Caribbean
for him to study seashells.

01:13:05.601 --> 01:13:09.897
Then one day he came to Crab Key,
and I never saw him again.

01:13:10.690 --> 01:13:16.112
They said he must have been drowned,
but he was far too good a diver for that.

01:13:16.195 --> 01:13:18.948
Didn't the police investigate?
Or your family?

01:13:19.032 --> 01:13:22.035
They investigated for a long time.

01:13:22.118 --> 01:13:24.954
Then they said
"Missing, presumed dead".

01:13:25.038 --> 01:13:28.166
I haven't got any family.
There was only my father and me.

01:13:28.249 --> 01:13:31.711
You mean you're here all alone?
Where did you live before?

01:13:31.794 --> 01:13:34.172
All over the world.

01:13:34.255 --> 01:13:38.426
The Philippines, Bali, Hawaii.
Anywhere there were shells.

01:13:38.509 --> 01:13:43.389
- You went to school somewhere?
- No need. We had an encyclopedia.

01:13:43.473 --> 01:13:47.435
I started at A when I was eight,
and now I've reached T.

01:13:47.518 --> 01:13:51.606
I bet I know a lot more things than you do.

01:13:51.689 --> 01:13:54.776
Didn't anyone in Kingston help?

01:13:54.859 --> 01:13:59.864
Well, there was this man who owned
the place where we were living.

01:13:59.947 --> 01:14:03.284
He let me stay on
for a while without paying.

01:14:03.368 --> 01:14:08.164
Then one night he came up
to my room... Well, you know.

01:14:08.831 --> 01:14:14.128
I scratched his face, and then...
But he was stronger than I was.

01:14:14.212 --> 01:14:17.715
What happened after that?

01:14:17.799 --> 01:14:22.095
I put a black widow spider
underneath his mosquito net.

01:14:22.178 --> 01:14:26.933
A female, and they're the worst.
It took him a whole week to die.

01:14:29.936 --> 01:14:32.438
Did I do wrong?

01:14:32.563 --> 01:14:36.150
Well, it wouldn't do to make a habit of it.

01:14:38.194 --> 01:14:41.739
Do you have a woman of your own?

01:14:43.783 --> 01:14:46.577
Captain, quick! Down here.

01:14:46.661 --> 01:14:49.664
Whatever's coming,
it's coming this way.

01:14:49.747 --> 01:14:52.250
This time I want to see it.

01:14:52.333 --> 01:14:55.378
And hurry -
there's less than 12 hours to go.

01:15:21.029 --> 01:15:26.075
Stay where you are. All of you.
Stay right where you are.

01:15:36.711 --> 01:15:39.630
OK, captain.
If that ain't a dragon, what is it?

01:15:39.714 --> 01:15:42.842
A dragon that runs on diesel engines.
Forget the spooks.

01:15:42.925 --> 01:15:46.637
You take the driver.
I'll take the headlights and the tyres.

01:15:46.721 --> 01:15:49.682
You keep safe out of sight.

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:29.514
- I told you to stay there.
- I was frightened.

01:16:44.654 --> 01:16:48.199
Come on out.
Hands where we can see 'em.

01:16:49.492 --> 01:16:51.786
And the dame. Quick.

01:16:51.869 --> 01:16:55.164
Unless you want an extra navel.

01:16:56.624 --> 01:16:58.793
Hold it. Drop that gun.

01:17:00.586 --> 01:17:03.506
Now kick it away from you.

01:17:04.632 --> 01:17:09.846
The girl stays where she is.
Walk towards me, hands out in front.

01:17:19.856 --> 01:17:21.316
Come on.

01:17:21.399 --> 01:17:24.902
Hey, you.
Where do you think you're going?

01:17:25.903 --> 01:17:30.158
Sorry we ain't got any flowers.
Come on, let's go.

01:17:30.241 --> 01:17:32.327
Come on. Let's go.

01:17:37.498 --> 01:17:40.418
Give me that knife.

01:17:51.971 --> 01:17:56.142
- Leave him alone.
- Get out of the way.

01:18:12.158 --> 01:18:16.120
Get inside.
Keep an eye on the man.

01:18:16.204 --> 01:18:21.542
And be careful. They've been
in the swamp and they're contaminated.

01:18:23.628 --> 01:18:26.756
Check their Geiger reading.

01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:36.224
- He's reading 95, chief.
- She's 88.

01:18:36.307 --> 01:18:39.811
Too much for the monitor.
Scrub them down, but quick.

01:19:02.125 --> 01:19:05.586
- Reading 72.8.
- The mud's soaked into their clothes.

01:19:05.670 --> 01:19:08.047
All right, then. Take off all their clothes.

01:19:08.131 --> 01:19:11.759
- What's he going to do?
- Do as he says. We're contaminated.

01:19:11.843 --> 01:19:14.929
- Do the girl first.
- We give the orders around here.

01:19:15.013 --> 01:19:19.392
That's fine, but do something
about this, will you? Come here.

01:19:20.643 --> 01:19:24.147
Use the high-temperature jets.
Full pressure.

01:19:31.779 --> 01:19:34.282
68.

01:19:36.034 --> 01:19:39.370
- She's reading 47.
- All right. Put the man through.

01:19:40.538 --> 01:19:43.458
He's now clocking 40.

01:19:45.877 --> 01:19:48.379
Reading 38.

01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:51.549
32.

01:19:51.632 --> 01:19:54.177
- Down to 8.
- Hold the girl.

01:19:56.596 --> 01:19:59.098
He's now 18.

01:20:01.768 --> 01:20:04.270
He's now at 8.

01:20:06.814 --> 01:20:09.776
- Practically zero. She's clear.
- Get the man ready.

01:20:15.448 --> 01:20:18.534
- He's got a count of four.
- Check his fingernails.

01:20:18.618 --> 01:20:20.703
Put your hand in there.

01:20:21.996 --> 01:20:25.625
- He's OK.
- I will notify reception they are coming.

01:20:26.459 --> 01:20:30.171
Decontamination here.
They're coming through now.

01:20:57.740 --> 01:21:00.451
Come in.

01:21:01.327 --> 01:21:03.997
Come in.
You poor dears.

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:09.335
We didn't know when to expect you. First
it was teatime yesterday, then dinner.

01:21:09.419 --> 01:21:12.755
It was only half an hour ago
we really knew you were on your way.

01:21:12.839 --> 01:21:16.592
Cigarette?
American, English, or Turkish?

01:21:16.676 --> 01:21:21.264
I'm Sister Rose, this is Sister Lily. We'll
make your stay as pleasant as possible.

01:21:21.347 --> 01:21:25.768
- That's most kind of you, but...
- Of course. You want to see your rooms.

01:21:25.852 --> 01:21:30.023
Breakfast is ordered,
and then you'll want to sleep.

01:21:32.775 --> 01:21:36.696
The doctor left orders you're not
to be disturbed until this evening.

01:21:36.779 --> 01:21:40.366
He'll be delighted if you join him
for dinner. Shall I say you will?

01:21:40.450 --> 01:21:44.454
- Tell him I also will be delighted.
- Splendid. I know he'll be pleased.

01:21:44.537 --> 01:21:47.040
Here we are.

01:21:48.708 --> 01:21:52.170
This will be your room, Mr Bond.

01:21:52.253 --> 01:21:55.548
This is your bathroom in here.

01:21:55.631 --> 01:21:58.343
And for you, young lady...

01:21:58.426 --> 01:22:01.346
this is your room.

01:22:03.181 --> 01:22:06.309
You'll find fresh clothes in here.

01:22:08.478 --> 01:22:12.649
I hope they fit.
We didn't get your sizes till last night.

01:22:12.732 --> 01:22:16.194
Don't hesitate to ring
if there's anything at all you want.

01:22:16.277 --> 01:22:19.906
Such as two air tickets to London?

01:22:19.989 --> 01:22:23.743
I'll leave you two dear people in peace.

01:22:36.923 --> 01:22:41.636
- Let's have some breakfast.
- How can you eat at a time like this?

01:22:41.719 --> 01:22:46.057
Because I'm hungry and we don't know
when we'll get the chance to eat again.

01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:47.225
Take this.

01:22:47.308 --> 01:22:51.896
Careful. The whole place
is probably wired for sound.

01:23:02.323 --> 01:23:04.951
Have you...

01:23:05.034 --> 01:23:07.745
Have you any idea
what they'll do with us?

01:23:07.829 --> 01:23:10.248
No idea.

01:23:10.331 --> 01:23:13.459
No door handles or windows, either.

01:23:15.878 --> 01:23:21.801
- It's a prison, then.
- Mink-lined with first-class service.

01:23:24.554 --> 01:23:26.639
What's the matter?

01:23:27.807 --> 01:23:30.310
I don't feel so good.

01:23:31.728 --> 01:23:34.647
I feel so sleepy.

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:39.694
Damn coffee.

01:24:53.810 --> 01:24:56.312
How do you feel?

01:24:57.897 --> 01:24:59.983
Sleepy.

01:25:01.067 --> 01:25:06.572
- What made us pass out like that?
- The coffee. It was drugged.

01:25:11.202 --> 01:25:14.414
It's time for dinner.
We mustn't keep the doctor waiting.

01:25:14.497 --> 01:25:18.292
That would never do.
You ready, Honey?

01:25:18.376 --> 01:25:20.461
I suppose so.

01:25:25.299 --> 01:25:28.094
You're doing fine.

01:25:30.930 --> 01:25:32.807
Come on.

01:25:34.225 --> 01:25:36.519
Am I properly dressed for the occasion?

01:25:36.602 --> 01:25:40.148
- Quite suitable.
- Suitable for what?

01:25:52.118 --> 01:25:54.620
This way, please.

01:25:57.582 --> 01:26:00.084
I'm glad your hands are sweating, too.

01:26:00.168 --> 01:26:05.089
Of course I'm scared, too.
Be natural and leave all the talking to me.

01:26:05.173 --> 01:26:07.300
In here, please.

01:26:07.383 --> 01:26:10.511
I hope you enjoy your dinner.

01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:07.902
Come and look.

01:27:16.786 --> 01:27:21.082
Artificial light. We could be
hundreds of feet beneath the sea here.

01:27:21.165 --> 01:27:25.128
Look at that. Sea tulips.
They do not grow above 200ft.

01:27:25.211 --> 01:27:28.840
One million dollars, Mr Bond.

01:27:28.923 --> 01:27:32.969
- You were wondering what it cost.
- As a matter of fact I was.

01:27:40.852 --> 01:27:44.522
Forgive my not shaking hands.
It's awkward with these. A misfortune.

01:27:44.605 --> 01:27:48.651
You were admiring my aquarium.

01:27:48.735 --> 01:27:50.945
Yes. It's quite impressive.

01:27:51.029 --> 01:27:54.991
A unique feat of engineering,
if I may say so. I designed it myself.

01:27:55.074 --> 01:27:59.579
The glass is convex, ten inches thick,
hence the magnifying effect.

01:27:59.662 --> 01:28:04.625
Minnows pretending they're whales.
Just like you on this island, Dr No.

01:28:04.709 --> 01:28:09.714
It depends, Mr Bond, on which side
of the glass you are.

01:28:09.797 --> 01:28:13.468
A medium dry martini,
lemon peel, shaken, not stirred.

01:28:13.551 --> 01:28:16.471
- Vodka?
- Of course.

01:28:16.554 --> 01:28:19.432
We'll have dinner at once.

01:28:19.515 --> 01:28:23.519
There's so much to discuss, so little time.

01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:48.711
Dr No, you haven't done badly,
considering.

01:28:48.795 --> 01:28:51.172
A handicap is what you make of it.

01:28:51.255 --> 01:28:54.050
I was the unwanted child
of a German missionary

01:28:54.133 --> 01:28:56.511
and a Chinese girl of good family.

01:28:56.594 --> 01:29:01.432
Yet I became treasurer of the most
powerful criminal society in China.

01:29:01.516 --> 01:29:06.104
It's rare for the Tongs to trust anyone
who isn't completely Chinese.

01:29:06.187 --> 01:29:08.690
I doubt they shall do so again.

01:29:08.773 --> 01:29:12.443
I escaped to America
with ten million of their dollars in gold.

01:29:12.527 --> 01:29:15.446
That's how you financed this operation.

01:29:15.530 --> 01:29:19.701
It was a good idea to use atomic power.
I'm glad you can handle it properly.

01:29:19.784 --> 01:29:24.622
I'd hate to think your decontamination
chamber wasn't effective.

01:29:24.706 --> 01:29:28.876
My work has given me
a unique knowledge of radioactivity,

01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:32.422
but not without costs, as you see.

01:29:33.006 --> 01:29:34.841
Yes.

01:29:34.924 --> 01:29:40.138
Your power source had
our organisation puzzled for some time.

01:29:40.221 --> 01:29:42.515
They are still puzzled.

01:29:42.598 --> 01:29:45.351
Not any longer.
I sent a complete report.

01:29:45.435 --> 01:29:50.356
You've not contacted your headquarters
since you requested a Geiger counter.

01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:54.193
But there are so many files
open on you already, Dr No.

01:29:54.277 --> 01:29:56.863
Our own, the CIA's...

01:29:57.947 --> 01:30:00.908
The one from the Tong society
that you robbed.

01:30:00.992 --> 01:30:05.163
When trouble comes, you'll find this is
a very small and naked little island.

01:30:05.246 --> 01:30:07.582
An expendable little island, Mr Bond.

01:30:07.665 --> 01:30:11.210
When my mission is accomplished,
I destroy it and move on.

01:30:11.294 --> 01:30:15.882
But the habit of enquiry is consistent.
You're wondering why, where, when.

01:30:15.965 --> 01:30:18.051
I only gratify your curiosity

01:30:18.134 --> 01:30:21.679
because you're the one man capable of
appreciating what I have done...

01:30:22.764 --> 01:30:25.558
and keeping it to himself.

01:30:26.142 --> 01:30:31.856
Just a minute. There's no point involving
the girl. She has nothing to do with us.

01:30:31.939 --> 01:30:35.026
Let her go free.
She'll promise not to talk.

01:30:35.109 --> 01:30:37.904
- No, I'm staying with you.
- I don't want you here.

01:30:37.987 --> 01:30:42.867
I agree. This is no place
for the girl. Take her away.

01:30:44.118 --> 01:30:45.912
No.

01:30:46.621 --> 01:30:49.457
- No.
- I'm sure the guards will amuse her.

01:30:49.540 --> 01:30:51.626
Let me go!

01:30:53.169 --> 01:30:57.924
That's a Dom PÃ©rignon '55.
It would be a pity to break it.

01:31:01.803 --> 01:31:04.931
I prefer the '53 myself.

01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:09.268
Clumsy effort, Mr Bond.
You disappoint me.

01:31:09.352 --> 01:31:12.981
I'm not a fool,
so please do not treat me as one.

01:31:13.064 --> 01:31:16.609
And that table knife, please put it back.

01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:21.614
We can't all be geniuses, can we?

01:31:21.698 --> 01:31:26.828
Does the toppling of American missiles
really compensate for having no hands?

01:31:27.954 --> 01:31:30.581
Missiles are the first step
to prove our power.

01:31:30.665 --> 01:31:35.670
Our power? Your disregard for human life
means you must be working for the East.

01:31:35.753 --> 01:31:39.632
East, West - just points of the compass,
each as stupid as the other.

01:31:39.716 --> 01:31:42.427
- I'm a member of SPECTRE.
- SPECTRE?

01:31:42.510 --> 01:31:49.017
Special Executive for Counterintelligence,
Terrorism, Revenge, Extortion.

01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:53.604
The four cornerstones of power, headed
by the greatest brains in the world.

01:31:53.688 --> 01:31:56.190
Correction. Criminal brains.

01:31:56.274 --> 01:32:00.320
The successful criminal brain
is always superior. It has to be.

01:32:00.403 --> 01:32:06.367
Why become criminal? The West would
welcome a scientist of your calibre.

01:32:07.243 --> 01:32:10.621
The Americans are fools.
They refused my services.

01:32:10.705 --> 01:32:15.251
So did the East.
Now they can both pay for their mistake.

01:32:15.335 --> 01:32:19.547
World domination.
That same old dream.

01:32:19.630 --> 01:32:23.926
Our asylums are full of people
who think they're Napoleon or God.

01:32:29.349 --> 01:32:34.646
You persist in trying to provoke me.
I could've had you killed in the swamp.

01:32:34.729 --> 01:32:36.939
And why didn't you?

01:32:37.023 --> 01:32:42.153
I thought you less stupid.
Usually, when a man gets in my way...

01:32:46.658 --> 01:32:50.078
But you were different.
You cost me time, money, effort.

01:32:50.161 --> 01:32:53.581
You damaged my organisation,
and my pride.

01:32:54.457 --> 01:32:56.668
I was curious to see what you were like.

01:32:56.751 --> 01:32:59.545
I thought there might be
a place for you with SPECTRE.

01:32:59.629 --> 01:33:02.256
I'm flattered.

01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:05.802
I'd prefer the revenge department.

01:33:05.885 --> 01:33:10.765
Of course, my first job would be finding
the killer of Strangways and Quarrel.

01:33:10.848 --> 01:33:15.728
Unfortunately I misjudged you.
You are just a stupid policeman...

01:33:18.606 --> 01:33:21.901
whose luck has run out.

01:33:21.985 --> 01:33:25.530
They're waiting for you
in the control room, Dr No.

01:33:25.613 --> 01:33:29.701
No hurry. They won't have started
their countdown check yet.

01:33:29.784 --> 01:33:35.873
You won't get away with it this time.
The Americans are prepared for trouble.

01:33:35.957 --> 01:33:39.293
I never fail, Mr Bond.

01:33:39.377 --> 01:33:43.840
- What do we do with him?
- Soften him up. I haven't finished yet.

01:39:24.764 --> 01:39:27.725
Have you got new fuel elements loaded?

01:39:27.809 --> 01:39:29.894
All ready, sir.

01:39:31.938 --> 01:39:35.274
The roadblock is about 3,000 feet away.

01:39:35.358 --> 01:39:39.320
Everyone in that area is pulled back.
No traffic allowed.

01:39:39.404 --> 01:39:43.116
The launch area is completely
cleared for safety...

01:39:52.625 --> 01:39:56.087
The vehicle is now at
its full weight of 240 tons.

01:39:56.170 --> 01:39:59.716
All the automatic transistors
have been put onto the vehicle.

01:39:59.799 --> 01:40:02.343
We will run up to half power
for 30 seconds.

01:40:06.222 --> 01:40:11.602
Control interlocks free.
Fuel elements 12.5.

01:40:30.455 --> 01:40:31.956
Control?

01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:37.337
Control rod actuators operating.
Core temperature 113.

01:40:37.420 --> 01:40:42.383
- Converters?
- Standing by. Ignition heaters on.

01:40:42.467 --> 01:40:47.555
- Radiation?
- Counters 121, 141, 109.

01:40:47.639 --> 01:40:52.393
- Energy stabilisers?
- Energy steady at.8 megawatts.

01:40:52.477 --> 01:40:56.356
Tracking stations are plugged into
the control centre at Cape Canaveral.

01:40:56.439 --> 01:40:59.025
Fuel elements?

01:40:59.108 --> 01:41:02.236
Fuel elements.
Where's Chang?

01:41:02.904 --> 01:41:06.866
Chang, what are you doing there?
Get on the gantry.

01:41:09.369 --> 01:41:11.454
Hurry.

01:41:17.001 --> 01:41:20.380
- Shut down.
- Shut down reactor.

01:41:28.805 --> 01:41:32.725
This is Mercury Control.
The countdown for the MV...

01:41:32.809 --> 01:41:35.979
Reactor shutdown,
temperature 227, falling.

01:42:00.712 --> 01:42:06.759
The countdown is now four minutes,
30 seconds and counting.

01:42:09.470 --> 01:42:11.931

01:42:12.015 --> 01:42:17.228
The spacecraft pilot, the launch,
the tracking crew in case of emergency,

01:42:17.312 --> 01:42:21.149
and now even the weatherman,
have given us the word go.

...two, one, zero.

01:43:58.621 --> 01:44:00.832
Liftoff!

01:45:02.268 --> 01:45:04.479
It's a very hot rocket.

01:45:04.562 --> 01:45:09.150
You can see the flame of it
against the grey of the cumulus.

01:45:09.233 --> 01:45:14.113
Up in the sunlight, beginning to gleam.
A very good, steady climb...

01:45:14.197 --> 01:45:19.202
All systems go! Go! Go!

01:45:31.881 --> 01:45:34.175
Honey! Honey!

01:45:40.848 --> 01:45:42.934
Honey!

What are we going to do now?

01:47:43.554 --> 01:47:47.892
- Well, we can swim, or...
- Or what?

01:47:47.976 --> 01:47:50.061
Come here.

01:48:03.366 --> 01:48:06.077
Ahoy, Mr Bond.

01:48:07.745 --> 01:48:11.958
Well, well. What's the matter?
Do you need help?

01:48:14.168 --> 01:48:18.423
