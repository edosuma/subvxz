00:42.000 --> 00:46.260
Federal prosecutor Sam Ellis is widely
expected to run for higher office.

00:46.360 --> 00:49.540
Those hopes could be dashed if the jury
returns with a "not guilty" verdict.

00:49.640 --> 00:52.260
A resolution is expected
shortly on federal charges.

00:52.360 --> 00:55.340
With rumors circulating that Ellis
plans to seek higher office...

00:55.440 --> 00:57.580
Everything is riding
on today's decision.

00:57.680 --> 01:00.460
Today's decision will either
launch his political career...

01:00.560 --> 01:03.140
Presumably beginning
with a run for attorney general.

01:03.240 --> 01:04.620
Mr. Ellis?

01:04.720 --> 01:07.460
Yeah.

01:07.560 --> 01:09.940
A couple of us arranged
this little drinks thing at Blend.

01:10.040 --> 01:12.700
We're kind of all assuming
that you'll be there.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.644
Don't we have to win first?

01:15.760 --> 01:17.808
There's no way you'll lose.

01:25.560 --> 01:26.980
All rise.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.540
Do you think Sheriff Haussler
should be given

01:30.640 --> 01:32.860
a lesser sentence given
his record of public service?

01:32.960 --> 01:36.820
As I said in the trial, Jim, this is
a black-and-white issue legally and morally.

01:36.920 --> 01:38.620
There should be no special treatment.

01:38.720 --> 01:41.860
After today's victory, do you intend
to pursue corruption charges

01:41.960 --> 01:44.300
against other officials
in the mayor's administration?

01:44.400 --> 01:46.880
No decisions on any further action
have been made at this time.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.241
Any chance you're gonna run
for attorney general, Sam?

01:49.360 --> 01:51.761
I have my hands full
at the U.S. Attorney's office right now.

01:51.880 --> 01:54.860
While Haussler is expected to appeal
today's decision, all eyes will be on

01:54.960 --> 01:58.567
whether the U.S. Attorney's office plans to
seek charges against Mayor Jonas Stiegel.

02:01.640 --> 02:03.180
So, straight on to attorney general?

02:03.280 --> 02:05.780
I can neither confirm
nor deny, counselor.

02:05.880 --> 02:07.580
Fucking liar.

02:07.680 --> 02:09.180
You didn't hear Mommy say that.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.930
How's his temperature?

02:12.160 --> 02:13.700
Almost there.

02:13.800 --> 02:14.940
We were watching you on TV.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.420
Yeah? Did I look nervous?

02:16.520 --> 02:17.540
I felt like I was shaking.

02:17.640 --> 02:18.527
You looked hot.

02:18.640 --> 02:21.660
Women on the jury really
loved your lady justice thing.

02:21.760 --> 02:22.940
Uh-huh. It's you they liked.

02:23.040 --> 02:25.180
Well, they did throw
their undergarments at me.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.420
- Is that unusual?
- Whores.

02:27.520 --> 02:29.420
My dad was watching with George Hiller.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.580
They think we should get
Nigel Coaker to write you up

02:31.680 --> 02:33.523
in his "Faces to Watch" piece.

02:33.640 --> 02:34.660
Yeah, that'd be amazing.

02:34.760 --> 02:36.500
I have Nigel's number.
I'll give him a call.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.380
He owes my dad a ton of favors, anyway.

02:38.480 --> 02:39.700
What time are you coming home?

02:39.800 --> 02:42.140
You know, they're having
a little victory lap party for us.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.780
I got to put in an appearance.

02:43.880 --> 02:44.980
Lame. I'm kidding.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.980
It's fine. Proud of you, honey.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.340
Okay, I'm pulling up. I love you.

02:48.440 --> 02:50.761
Love you.

02:54.840 --> 02:55.900
To Sam Ellis.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.420
After 18 months of nonstop toil,
may he enjoy his moment in the sun

03:01.520 --> 03:04.420
'cause tomorrow I'm going
to bury him under a pile of work.

03:05.800 --> 03:06.961
To Sam.

03:07.080 --> 03:08.206
To Sam.

03:14.040 --> 03:14.768
Fucking lawyers.

03:14.880 --> 03:17.060
Do you guys not get it out
of your systems freshman year?

03:17.160 --> 03:19.640
- Fuck off.
- Fuck off?

03:19.760 --> 03:21.700
Okay.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.529
Jeannie must be excited, yeah?

03:23.640 --> 03:25.740
Yeah. Yeah.
She's getting restless, though.

03:25.840 --> 03:28.940
Don't tell me you're not, either.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.220
You've done all you can here,

03:30.320 --> 03:32.580
especially with that fucking
fossil running the show.

03:32.680 --> 03:33.980
- Easy.
- All right.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.780
It's...

03:35.880 --> 03:37.740
It's time, yeah?

03:37.840 --> 03:40.580
Sam Ellis for attorney fucking general.

03:40.680 --> 03:43.780
Everybody was just waiting
for you to win this fucker.

03:45.140 --> 03:48.540
- Put a pin in it for now.
- No, no.

03:48.640 --> 03:49.926
Don't leave me hanging here.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.940
There's got to be more to life
than hedge funds,

03:52.040 --> 03:53.980
or I'm gonna fucking kill myself.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.286
Come on.

03:55.400 --> 03:58.060
I do have to go, though.

03:58.160 --> 04:00.686
- Before the wife throws a fit.
- Come on.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.260
Listen, congrats again.

04:02.360 --> 04:03.600
- Yeah.
- All right.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.404
- See ya.
- See ya.

04:12.520 --> 04:13.885
I'll take another.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.900
You did not!

04:30.000 --> 04:31.809
No, I don't believe you.

04:42.960 --> 04:45.566
I'm not saying that.
You did a great job.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.780
Then what exactly
are you saying, counselor?

04:47.880 --> 04:50.940
I am saying that you should
just move around a bit

04:51.040 --> 04:52.180
before the semester's over.

04:52.280 --> 04:54.140
You don't want to go back
to law school thinking

04:54.240 --> 04:58.660
that this whole office
is just one boring section.

04:58.760 --> 05:00.460
What if I like your section?

05:00.560 --> 05:02.660
I still think it's a mistake.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.380
I do. You got to figure out
what you believe in,

05:05.480 --> 05:07.500
what makes your righteous.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.620
Angry, even.

05:09.720 --> 05:11.500
And you have this figured out?

05:11.600 --> 05:12.860
Absolutely.

05:12.960 --> 05:17.260
Guys that I take down have
no reason to break the law,

05:17.360 --> 05:21.260
yet they're these over privileged,
morally bankrupt individuals

05:21.360 --> 05:25.380
who think they can just stomp
on the weak and the powerless

05:25.480 --> 05:28.700
and get away with it
because they usually do.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.260
If I didn't think
they deserved to go down,

05:31.360 --> 05:32.930
couldn't try the case.

05:35.800 --> 05:39.940
Don't quote me on that.
These cigarettes are going to my head.

05:40.304 --> 05:44.440
- You're a lightweight.
- Yeah, I don't... I don't smoke.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.820
Just doing it to impress me?

05:47.920 --> 05:51.845
Oh, I gave up trying to impress
girls like you a long time ago.

05:56.640 --> 05:58.688
Oh, boy.

06:22.280 --> 06:24.760
Yeah, this...

06:24.880 --> 06:27.645
Can't do precisely that.

06:28.760 --> 06:30.420
Right.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.124
I'm sorry.

06:32.360 --> 06:34.820
- Yeah.
- You're married.

06:44.080 --> 06:46.954
You know, I can keep a secret, though.

06:48.280 --> 06:51.260
I'm sure you can.

06:51.360 --> 06:53.567
I just can't be one of them.

06:54.520 --> 06:55.980
Hmm.

06:56.080 --> 06:57.650
Goodnight, kiddo.

08:30.560 --> 08:32.369
I love you, Ellis.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.205
I love you, too.

08:59.160 --> 09:00.220
If you want to move on this,

09:00.320 --> 09:02.580
you better be staying here
long enough to see it through,

09:02.680 --> 09:04.100
'cause I'm not getting burned on it.

09:04.200 --> 09:05.500
Guy's committed actual crimes.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.460
If human frailty's all we got,
it'll look like a moral crusade.

09:08.560 --> 09:09.100
Then let it go.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.540
It's not my job
to help you chase headlines.

09:11.640 --> 09:14.220
Do you want the mayor
out of office or not?

09:14.320 --> 09:15.731
Yeah.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.100
Hey, how much longer is Dalia with us?

09:19.200 --> 09:20.220
Eight weeks.

09:20.320 --> 09:21.660
Any chance we could transfer her?

09:21.760 --> 09:23.620
I'm not telling the ninth circuit judge

09:23.720 --> 09:26.540
I fired his daughter
'cause she's too damn pretty.

09:26.640 --> 09:27.801
Huh.

09:29.240 --> 09:31.083
Sam.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.340
This is Ellie Green.

09:32.440 --> 09:35.060
Miss Green, this is Sam Ellis,
chief of our criminal division.

09:35.160 --> 09:36.420
- Sam Ellis.
- Hello.

09:36.520 --> 09:38.420
- Hi.
- You've already met U.S. Attorney Kirkland.

09:38.520 --> 09:39.820
I wanted Sam to review your file.

09:39.920 --> 09:42.380
He's tried a lot
of these identity theft cases.

09:42.480 --> 09:45.060
Knows how to work a jury
on these kind of issues.

09:45.160 --> 09:47.766
Mm. The right man for the job, then.

09:51.360 --> 09:54.020
So, what's the concern?

09:54.120 --> 09:57.060
Would you prefer to explain?

09:57.160 --> 09:59.766
I have a record as an escort.

10:01.640 --> 10:04.260
How'd you...

10:04.360 --> 10:05.740
How'd you get into that?

10:05.840 --> 10:06.740
I was trying to model

10:06.840 --> 10:11.260
and I was working
as a waitress at a hotel.

10:11.360 --> 10:15.220
I met this guy who suggested
I could make a lot more money

10:15.320 --> 10:19.340
just going on a few dates for an agency.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.060
He was right.

10:21.160 --> 10:22.700
That how you met the defendant?

10:22.800 --> 10:24.100
No.

10:24.200 --> 10:28.860
Elite Encounters only serviced
very high-end clients,

10:28.960 --> 10:31.980
politicians, prominent businessmen.

10:32.080 --> 10:36.460
I saved the lowlifes
for my personal life.

10:36.560 --> 10:38.340
Would you say that
your experience makes you

10:38.440 --> 10:40.124
an expert in lying?

10:41.840 --> 10:44.220
No.

10:44.320 --> 10:47.580
No, it's... it's not about that.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.380
It's about fulfilling people's fantasies

10:50.480 --> 10:54.180
while minimizing their guilt.

10:54.280 --> 10:55.725
I'd say being a lawyer

10:55.840 --> 10:59.700
is probably better training for lying.

10:59.800 --> 11:01.220
But you do have a criminal record.

11:01.320 --> 11:03.340
Not for lying.

11:03.440 --> 11:04.940
Would you tell your parents about it?

11:05.040 --> 11:06.451
It's not like I was a street walker.

11:06.560 --> 11:09.131
You think the jury would
perceive that distinction?

11:10.640 --> 11:11.880
The men will.

11:19.680 --> 11:20.806
Yeah.

11:22.320 --> 11:24.700
I know I should really
push the parent issue.

11:24.800 --> 11:25.820
The jury might get past it

11:25.920 --> 11:28.180
if they see her
as an abandoned kid up there.

11:28.280 --> 11:30.140
Maybe.

11:30.240 --> 11:33.540
Everyone's got a dark side
you don't normally get to see.

11:33.640 --> 11:36.020
I think jurors understand that.

11:36.120 --> 11:39.140
I know a lot of guys
who used her agency.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.700
Swore by it.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.564
Shouldn't we be prosecuting that?

11:42.680 --> 11:45.620
Trafficking, sure,
but we got bigger problems.

11:45.720 --> 11:47.260
You said it yourself, Sam.

11:47.360 --> 11:50.340
Nobody cares about human frailty.

11:50.440 --> 11:51.860
It's still against the law.

11:51.960 --> 11:54.370
Right. Boy Scout.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.740
Say "hi" to the intern for me.

12:07.880 --> 12:10.100
Night, chief. Have a great weekend.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.565
Take it easy.

13:18.440 --> 13:19.646
Oh.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.605
No.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.780
James asked if he could have a sibling.

14:13.880 --> 14:14.927
Really?

14:15.040 --> 14:16.540
Yeah.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.980
That Stiegel?

14:19.080 --> 14:21.287
No, I'm just helping Noah with a case.

14:25.040 --> 14:28.300
You think a jury would discredit
testimony from an escort?

14:28.400 --> 14:30.607
I don't know.
Depends on the witness, I guess.

14:30.720 --> 14:33.780
You don't think they'd find it
morally reprehensible?

14:33.880 --> 14:35.820
I think they probably
understand it's not quite

14:35.920 --> 14:37.700
the taboo it used to be.

14:37.800 --> 14:43.842
I mean, you got all those people
watching internet porn.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.020
What's she like? You meet her?

14:47.120 --> 14:48.360
Is she sexy?

14:49.720 --> 14:51.085
I don't know.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.780
- You tired?
- Yeah.

15:08.880 --> 15:12.180
I just... I have to be up early.

15:12.280 --> 15:13.964
Can I get a hug?

15:15.800 --> 15:18.406
I think I can manage that.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.040
James, you ready?

15:33.160 --> 15:34.700
- Here, John, I got that.
- I got it.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.660
- Okay.
- Don't worry.

15:36.760 --> 15:38.060
Not joining us, huh, Sam?

15:38.160 --> 15:39.140
No.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.020
Sure you can survive a whole weekend

15:41.120 --> 15:42.140
without my daughter?

15:42.240 --> 15:44.260
I'll have to try, sir.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.060
Don't really have your sea legs, anyway.

15:46.160 --> 15:47.730
That is true.

15:47.840 --> 15:50.980
Remind me next time.
I got some pills for that.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.820
You taking the new one?

15:52.920 --> 15:54.570
You bet.

15:54.680 --> 15:57.660
130-footer.

15:57.760 --> 15:58.740
Wow.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.260
Stiegel keeping you on land?

16:00.360 --> 16:01.260
Yeah, mostly.

16:01.360 --> 16:04.460
Guess you pretty much
dug yourself into that hole.

16:04.560 --> 16:06.700
What's your plans if you lose?

16:06.800 --> 16:08.700
Doing my best not to lose.

16:08.800 --> 16:09.820
Well,

16:09.920 --> 16:12.740
try not to burn the house down
while we're away, huh?

16:12.840 --> 16:14.780
Will do.

16:14.880 --> 16:16.580
Hey, Jimmy.

16:16.680 --> 16:20.100
- Have fun, pal.
- Ready to go sailing with Grandpa?

16:20.200 --> 16:21.060
How bad was he?

16:21.160 --> 16:23.100
The usual. Do you have to go?

16:23.200 --> 16:24.850
I'm going to be so bored
without you guys.

16:24.960 --> 16:27.100
You're so sweet.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.180
It's only a couple of days.
Be back Sunday night.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.100
Okay.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.780
And...

16:31.880 --> 16:36.700
if you get lonely, you can
always call that witness.

16:37.520 --> 16:40.000
I love you.

17:17.720 --> 17:18.980
"Money exchanged

17:19.079 --> 17:25.122
is intended for companionship
and modeling services only."

18:14.640 --> 18:18.087
Can I get a pre-paid phone there?

18:42.840 --> 18:45.580
Executive privilege.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.580
Hi, yes.

18:47.680 --> 18:50.500
I was looking on your site and

18:50.600 --> 18:53.251
I'm just wondering how I could

18:53.360 --> 18:55.500
make an appointment with Christy.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.060
Christy, yeah. Great girl.

18:57.160 --> 18:58.780
She's one of our favorites.

18:58.880 --> 18:59.820
My name's Mona.

18:59.920 --> 19:03.367
I just need to ask you a few questions.

19:03.480 --> 19:04.300
What...

19:04.400 --> 19:05.845
What questions?

19:05.960 --> 19:07.020
Well, what's your name?

19:07.120 --> 19:08.540
Oh, yeah. Okay.

19:08.640 --> 19:12.300
My name is Bob Fisher.

19:12.400 --> 19:15.140
And what do you do, Bob?

19:15.240 --> 19:17.340
I'm a... I'm a lawyer.

19:17.440 --> 19:18.940
Okay, Bob, is there something

19:19.040 --> 19:21.420
that you can tell me about yourself

19:21.520 --> 19:22.820
that I could share with Christy?

19:22.920 --> 19:23.900
Oh, I don't know.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.900
I'm Caucasian.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.860
Six feet, 190.

19:28.960 --> 19:29.940
Pretty good shape.

19:30.040 --> 19:32.620
What are some of your hobbies?
What do you like to do, Bob?

19:32.720 --> 19:34.290
Not much of a movie guy.

19:34.400 --> 19:35.980
I...

19:36.080 --> 19:39.020
read a lot. I like the crime novels.

19:39.120 --> 19:41.700
Well, I'm sure Christy
will like to dress for you.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.211
Do you have any preferences?

19:44.600 --> 19:48.580
Maybe like... like a tight sweater.

19:48.680 --> 19:49.660
I don't know.

19:49.760 --> 19:53.380
You know what you like, yes?

19:53.480 --> 19:54.340
Yeah.

19:54.440 --> 19:57.140
Have you ever used an agency before?

19:57.240 --> 19:58.380
No.

19:58.480 --> 19:59.686
No. First time.

19:59.800 --> 20:03.202
Okay, perfect.
My favorite kind of client.

20:04.960 --> 20:06.660
So, once you get there,

20:06.760 --> 20:10.780
you'll leave your money
in an envelope on the counter.

20:10.880 --> 20:13.580
And once we know that
everybody's fine, safe, happy,

20:13.680 --> 20:16.940
and comfortable,
then we'll start the hour.

20:17.040 --> 20:20.020
And if you're not happy,
all you have to do is call,

20:20.120 --> 20:22.460
and we'll make sure
we'll make you happy.

20:22.560 --> 20:24.620
We have plenty of girls.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.580
She'll be at the Stanwick Hotel.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.740
Have you been there before?

20:28.840 --> 20:30.820
Stanwick, yeah. Yes.
I know where that is.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.540
- Room 209.
- 209.

20:33.640 --> 20:36.140
Yeah, and if anything
comes up, Bob, give me a call,

20:36.240 --> 20:39.460
- and I'll do the same for you.
- Okay.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.420
I'll be on time.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.020
Thank you, Bob.

20:43.120 --> 20:44.406
Thank you.

21:13.880 --> 21:15.564
Shit.

21:24.040 --> 21:25.300
What floor you heading to?

21:25.400 --> 21:27.687
Two, please. Thank you.

22:25.640 --> 22:27.540
- Hi there.
- Hi.

22:27.640 --> 22:29.660
So, you must be...

22:29.760 --> 22:31.140
- Christy.
- Christy.

22:31.240 --> 22:33.500
Your hair looks different.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.260
Oh, I love this suit.

22:35.360 --> 22:37.260
- Oh, thank you.
- Don't tell me.

22:37.360 --> 22:38.980
It's Canali?

22:39.080 --> 22:41.082
Wow, that's impressive.

22:43.240 --> 22:44.260
Uh, I have the, uh...

22:44.360 --> 22:46.820
Oh, you can just leave
the donation on the counter.

22:46.920 --> 22:48.206
Right.

22:55.840 --> 22:57.410
So, yeah.

22:58.880 --> 23:00.940
First time, maybe?

23:01.040 --> 23:03.100
Might be.

23:03.200 --> 23:08.127
Well, I am flattered you chose me, then.

23:08.240 --> 23:10.242
I can already tell
you're my kind of guy.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.740
Sorry, I'm...

23:17.840 --> 23:19.776
I don't know how this works.

23:21.560 --> 23:23.500
Bob, do you like scotch?

23:23.600 --> 23:24.460
Sure, yeah.

23:24.560 --> 23:27.060
Why don't I fix you a drink?

23:27.160 --> 23:28.764
- Yeah.
- Okay.

23:31.240 --> 23:33.891
Make yourself comfortable.

23:38.440 --> 23:39.820
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

23:39.920 --> 23:41.126
That's good.

23:55.120 --> 23:57.122
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

24:02.960 --> 24:05.770
I seriously love this fabric.

24:06.600 --> 24:07.900
You have really good taste.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.685
Thank you. Yeah.

24:10.800 --> 24:13.260
Worked at a clothing store in college.

24:13.360 --> 24:16.154
Wound up spending most
of my paycheck on clothes.

24:16.254 --> 24:18.660
- And now I sound like a girl.
- No.

24:18.760 --> 24:20.700
No, even men need to be pampered.

24:20.800 --> 24:22.460
Yeah.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.700
I...

24:24.800 --> 24:27.780
I used to work as a massage therapist.

24:27.880 --> 24:30.540
So...

24:30.640 --> 24:33.980
I know how important it is
to have someone around

24:34.080 --> 24:36.048
to take care of your needs.

25:13.040 --> 25:16.460
You must have a really stressful job.

25:16.560 --> 25:17.540
Yeah.

25:17.640 --> 25:20.246
I can feel it in your shoulders.

25:27.800 --> 25:30.371
You want to take a shower with me?

25:35.160 --> 25:37.083
I'll do it myself.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.402
You want to come join me?

26:14.040 --> 26:15.883
I can't do this.

26:18.520 --> 26:19.500
I'm sorry.

26:19.600 --> 26:21.060
It's my mistake.

26:21.160 --> 26:25.449
Well, there's no need to rush.

26:25.560 --> 26:26.580
We can just talk.

26:26.680 --> 26:29.140
Thank you, but I... I... I have to go.

26:29.240 --> 26:30.730
I'm... I'm sorry.

26:33.520 --> 26:35.420
Let me help you.

26:35.520 --> 26:36.885
Thank you.

26:40.520 --> 26:42.660
You married?

26:42.760 --> 26:44.000
Yeah.

26:44.120 --> 26:45.500
13 Years.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.300
13 years.

26:47.400 --> 26:48.845
Yeah.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.246
How old are you?

26:52.000 --> 26:53.445
We were married young.

26:56.280 --> 26:58.044
I see.

26:59.000 --> 26:59.940
What?

27:00.040 --> 27:03.522
Well, I can understand why you're here.

27:03.640 --> 27:07.361
It must be hard giving
your youth away to one person.

27:13.880 --> 27:15.723
It's a lot of things.

27:18.560 --> 27:21.820
She cheated on me back in school.

27:21.920 --> 27:24.420
I thought...

27:24.520 --> 27:27.444
You know, it's before
we were married, but I...

27:30.040 --> 27:32.247
Are there things she won't do?

27:33.520 --> 27:35.900
Things you want to try?

27:36.000 --> 27:37.729
Yeah, sure.

27:41.440 --> 27:43.681
I like to try things.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.164
Is that okay?

28:53.880 --> 28:55.370
Oh, god.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.780
How are you doing?

29:09.880 --> 29:11.211
I'm good.

29:13.240 --> 29:14.580
You want to fuck me now?

29:14.680 --> 29:16.125
Yeah.

30:05.080 --> 30:06.491
Fuck!

30:14.800 --> 30:17.724
So, any plans for the rest of the day?

30:18.640 --> 30:19.900
Sorry.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.340
You don't have to answer that.

30:22.440 --> 30:23.805
No. I...

30:25.000 --> 30:28.607
I have no more appointments
if that's what you're asking.

30:28.720 --> 30:30.927
I might go lingerie shopping.

30:33.640 --> 30:37.300
Hey, do you always kiss on the lips?

30:37.400 --> 30:40.180
I thought that wasn't part of it.

30:40.280 --> 30:41.850
You're sweet.

30:43.200 --> 30:45.940
Well, Christy...

30:46.040 --> 30:47.420
it was nice to meet you.

30:47.520 --> 30:49.260
You know, you should make an appointment

30:49.360 --> 30:51.260
with my friend Clio.

30:51.360 --> 30:53.220
She's the top girl at the agency.

30:53.320 --> 30:55.004
She only sees referrals.

30:55.120 --> 30:58.180
Maybe the three of us
could have some fun together.

30:58.280 --> 31:01.660
Sorry, but this was a one time thing.

31:01.760 --> 31:02.980
Well, I'll tell her about you

31:03.080 --> 31:05.540
in case you change your mind.

31:05.640 --> 31:08.564
Trust me, you'll definitely like her.

31:11.320 --> 31:12.321
Thank you.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.490
- Thank you.
- Sure.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.900
- Dad!
- Hey.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.765
Wha... what are you doing home?

32:05.880 --> 32:07.380
We got back early.

32:07.480 --> 32:09.060
Thought we'd surprise you.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.060
Where you been?

32:10.160 --> 32:13.740
We had a meeting with some
of the agents on Stiegel.

32:13.840 --> 32:15.380
A weekend? That's a drag.

32:15.480 --> 32:17.300
- Yeah.
- Your hair's wet.

32:17.400 --> 32:18.260
You been to the gym?

32:18.360 --> 32:19.700
Yeah, stopped on my way back.

32:19.800 --> 32:21.040
Good for you.

32:23.280 --> 32:24.260
Want to come eat?

32:24.360 --> 32:26.681
Yeah. Smells amazing.

33:33.840 --> 33:36.081
With more than 800,000 federal workers

33:36.200 --> 33:37.820
standing to lose their paychecks...

33:37.920 --> 33:40.180
You nervous?

33:40.280 --> 33:44.140
I'm just wondering
if it's the smart move

33:44.240 --> 33:45.685
to do this right now.

33:45.800 --> 33:47.420
He knows I can't talk about Stiegel.

33:47.520 --> 33:49.620
Nigel Coaker's on "Meet the Press"
every other week.

33:49.720 --> 33:52.087
He's barely gonna know who Stiegel is.

33:54.920 --> 33:56.060
Which one?

33:56.160 --> 33:57.366
Your call.

33:58.200 --> 33:59.700
You know, don't overthink it.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.404
Just relax.

34:02.720 --> 34:04.722
Let him see the man underneath.

34:06.960 --> 34:09.820
Many estimates suggest a shutdown
could cost the government...

34:09.920 --> 34:13.100
Nice. Just a few more.

34:13.199 --> 34:14.406
Good.

34:16.719 --> 34:18.780
So, Sam, your mother,

34:18.880 --> 34:21.139
you've cited her as being
a source of inspiration.

34:21.239 --> 34:23.402
Was arrested on a number of occasions

34:23.520 --> 34:25.460
in protests during the '70s.

34:25.560 --> 34:29.620
What does she think about
you becoming a federal prosecutor?

34:29.719 --> 34:33.179
Well, she passed away
before I got the job, but...

34:33.280 --> 34:34.610
I hope she'd be proud of me.

34:34.719 --> 34:36.780
Would she have
supported your prosecution

34:36.880 --> 34:41.139
of medical marijuana
facilities, for example?

34:41.239 --> 34:43.219
Well, Nigel, my mother
taught me from an early age

34:43.320 --> 34:46.300
to fight for justice, protect those
who are vulnerable.

34:46.400 --> 34:47.940
The law's the best way to do that.

34:48.040 --> 34:50.420
The U.S. Attorney's office
prosecutes those who break it.

34:50.520 --> 34:51.900
We don't decide what the laws are.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.243
No, but you pick the cases you pursue.

34:55.360 --> 34:58.420
So, that means there is a moral intent.

34:58.520 --> 35:03.380
Now, if 20 states have
a medical exemption for it,

35:03.480 --> 35:06.140
how can the issue be black-and-white?

35:06.240 --> 35:07.260
Because it is.

35:07.360 --> 35:09.740
Nigel, I want to thank you
for including me in your piece.

35:09.840 --> 35:11.660
Oh, anything for Jeannie.

35:11.760 --> 35:13.728
Listen, Sam, if you're interested,

35:13.840 --> 35:15.140
I'd like to talk to the magazine

35:15.240 --> 35:16.860
about doing a longer profile on you,

35:16.960 --> 35:17.980
something more personal.

35:18.080 --> 35:19.500
Maybe I can trail you in the office.

35:19.600 --> 35:22.740
You know, do a "day in the life"
kind of thing.

35:22.840 --> 35:24.860
Well, our meetings
are usually confidential,

35:24.960 --> 35:27.060
but I'm sure we can arrange something.

35:27.160 --> 35:28.580
Look, I got to get James to school.

35:28.680 --> 35:30.740
- You got any more questions?
- Yes.

35:30.840 --> 35:32.649
When are you running?

35:34.000 --> 35:35.604
Mom's gonna pick you up.

35:38.960 --> 35:41.180
Your father seems to think he'll go far

35:41.280 --> 35:43.220
if he can handle the pressure.

35:43.320 --> 35:45.340
What do you think?

35:45.440 --> 35:47.140
I don't think he likes me.

35:47.240 --> 35:49.660
Oh, he's just sensitive
about his mother, that's all.

35:49.760 --> 35:51.540
Mm, well, I think he's intimidated

35:51.640 --> 35:55.340
by the size of my reputation.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.860
How are you two doing?

36:01.960 --> 36:03.420
Great.

36:03.520 --> 36:06.100
Things are a little crazed,
but we're great.

36:06.200 --> 36:08.282
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

36:22.360 --> 36:24.340
There's a piece about
the attorney general race

36:24.440 --> 36:26.100
- on the news right now.
- Oh, yeah?

36:26.200 --> 36:28.100
I need to watch that.

36:28.200 --> 36:29.380
They mention me?

36:29.480 --> 36:31.700
No, they weren't singling anybody out.

36:31.800 --> 36:33.609
You want me to record it?

36:37.680 --> 36:39.045
Sam?

36:41.640 --> 36:43.961
Yeah, that'd be great. Thanks.

36:49.320 --> 36:52.881
Is there a history
of cancer in your family?

36:53.360 --> 36:56.330
My mother died from liver cancer.

36:56.440 --> 37:00.540
But, you know, she was
a heavy smoker and big drinker.

37:00.640 --> 37:04.770
Have you been with any new
sexual partners recently?

37:06.920 --> 37:09.685
Well, I'm married.

37:11.160 --> 37:12.924
But yeah.

37:13.040 --> 37:15.725
One other one a few days ago.

37:16.960 --> 37:18.140
It was just one time, though,

37:18.240 --> 37:20.447
and I... I used a condom.

37:22.320 --> 37:23.651
Well, there is a bump,

37:23.760 --> 37:26.570
but it's probably
an ingrown hair or something.

37:27.440 --> 37:30.011
In all likelihood, I think you're fine.

37:33.600 --> 37:37.810
Ladies and gentlemen,
Senator Edward Pollan.

37:40.640 --> 37:41.740
Thank you, Jeannie.

37:41.840 --> 37:45.380
Your exemplary work
with the edible schoolyard project

37:45.480 --> 37:48.300
is an inspiration to all of us.

37:48.400 --> 37:51.961
You know, I often ask myself
what we can do in Washington

37:52.080 --> 37:55.163
to help shape
our children's sense of place.

37:58.240 --> 37:59.969
Sam Ellis.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.220
- George Hiller.
- Yes.

38:03.320 --> 38:05.180
Glad to finally meet you in person.

38:05.280 --> 38:06.700
Absolutely, sir.

38:06.800 --> 38:08.100
That country club thing,

38:08.200 --> 38:10.220
that was a heck of a move.

38:10.320 --> 38:11.220
Thank you.

38:11.320 --> 38:14.580
I understand that you're looking
at attorney general.

38:14.680 --> 38:19.288
Well, I'm not looking at any job
beyond my current employment.

38:19.400 --> 38:21.243
I got something better.

38:24.280 --> 38:25.980
What'll you two ladies have?

38:26.080 --> 38:27.420
I'll take a champagne, please.

38:27.520 --> 38:29.740
- Bourbon and soda for me.
- Yes, ma'am.

38:29.840 --> 38:31.001
Who are you?

38:31.120 --> 38:33.220
- Jeannie?
- Noah.

38:33.320 --> 38:34.460
How's the boss treating you?

38:34.560 --> 38:36.140
Oh, total slave master.

38:36.240 --> 38:37.220
I'll bet.

38:37.320 --> 38:41.140
He drag you in for that
FBI meeting last weekend?

38:41.240 --> 38:42.620
No.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.722
Guess it must've been
above my pay grade.

38:44.840 --> 38:47.940
Well, don't worry. You'll make it.

38:48.040 --> 38:49.260
You want a drink?

38:49.360 --> 38:50.740
Senator Pollan?

38:50.840 --> 38:51.980
You sure?

38:52.080 --> 38:54.180
He's gonna give up his seat?

38:54.280 --> 38:57.020
I got him to promise
not to go public yet,

38:57.120 --> 38:58.700
but it's done.

38:58.800 --> 39:03.580
Now, Pollan says
he's gonna announce in a year.

39:03.680 --> 39:06.340
When he announces, we pull the trigger.

39:06.440 --> 39:09.180
You quit your job
and you jump in the race.

39:09.280 --> 39:15.401
But I got to know now whether
you got the balls for this.

39:16.720 --> 39:18.290
I'll have to think it over.

39:20.040 --> 39:21.300
Well, think it over.

39:21.400 --> 39:25.260
But remember, I'm the other woman here,

39:25.360 --> 39:27.500
so don't keep me waiting.

39:27.600 --> 39:29.260
Now, Nigel Coaker's

39:29.360 --> 39:31.980
already agreed
to write the longer article,

39:32.080 --> 39:34.481
which will keep things alive.

39:34.600 --> 39:40.050
You just cultivate that clean image
because your mythology

39:40.200 --> 39:42.168
is your best asset.

39:46.240 --> 39:47.207
Look, I know you're...

39:47.320 --> 39:49.980
Hi, there. So nice to meet you.

39:50.080 --> 39:53.050
I love your tuxedo. Is that Armani?

39:53.160 --> 39:55.970
I'm the one who gets you there.

39:56.080 --> 39:58.300
I win these things.

39:58.400 --> 40:01.420
So, why don't we pool our resources?

40:01.520 --> 40:05.380
I'll bring in my boys, and you
and Jeannie bring in yours,

40:05.480 --> 40:07.580
and we'll work together and get

40:07.680 --> 40:08.700
the right team around you

40:08.800 --> 40:13.180
and there's just no telling
where this stops.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.930
You with me?

40:18.640 --> 40:20.051
Absolutely.

40:23.080 --> 40:25.003
We should definitely keep talking.

40:25.920 --> 40:28.207
It was very nice to finally meet you.

40:52.840 --> 40:55.810
You should see my friend, Clio.

41:42.560 --> 41:45.040
Care for a nightcap, Congressman?

41:48.720 --> 41:50.580
What, are you drunk?

41:50.680 --> 41:52.140
You're not drunk enough.

41:52.240 --> 41:56.300
Would you come to bed?
We should be celebrating.

41:56.400 --> 41:59.260
Aren't you excited?

41:59.360 --> 42:02.380
We would be scrutinized
under a microscope.

42:02.480 --> 42:03.500
You know that, right?

42:03.600 --> 42:05.364
Do we have anything to hide?

42:07.440 --> 42:09.249
Of course not.

42:10.240 --> 42:13.140
But you know
these campaigns get personal.

42:13.240 --> 42:16.020
Certain level of brutality, exposure.

42:16.120 --> 42:18.600
Just want to make sure
it's the right moment

42:18.720 --> 42:20.340
while James is so young.

42:20.440 --> 42:21.900
Well, James isn't like his friends.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.340
He obsesses about presidents

42:23.440 --> 42:25.580
the way other boys
obsess about dinosaurs.

42:25.680 --> 42:30.500
I mean, isn't this exactly
what you always wanted?

42:32.520 --> 42:34.980
What?

42:35.080 --> 42:38.460
I just noticed how adorable
you are in my shirt.

42:38.560 --> 42:40.961
I just... right now. Come here.

43:15.600 --> 43:17.011
Come back up here.

43:24.600 --> 43:26.887
No, no. Don't do that. Unh-unh.

43:27.280 --> 43:28.520
This way.

43:51.880 --> 43:53.405
I love you.

43:54.480 --> 43:58.700
I know all the sacrifices
you've made for this.

43:58.800 --> 44:02.300
I'm just not sure about Hiller.

44:02.400 --> 44:03.820
Everybody knows he plays dirty.

44:03.920 --> 44:06.082
Well, his candidates win.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.480
I need to know
you still really want this.

44:15.680 --> 44:22.340
That you're the same
idealistic guy I fell for

44:22.440 --> 44:24.780
who's gonna change the world.

44:24.880 --> 44:27.820
Maybe one with a little
less hair, but yeah.

44:27.920 --> 44:29.684
Same guy, I hope.

44:31.160 --> 44:32.685
Then I'll be there.

44:34.960 --> 44:36.610
I believe in you, Sam.

44:37.720 --> 44:40.769
Just do whatever you need
to do to make it happen.

45:05.400 --> 45:06.660
Executive privilege.

45:06.760 --> 45:10.207
Hi, this is Bob Fisher calling back.

45:11.320 --> 45:13.860
I'd like to make an appointment
with... with Clio.

45:13.960 --> 45:17.965
Hi, Bob. Yes, Clio.

45:19.440 --> 45:25.420
Christy had said
she'd tell her about me.

45:25.520 --> 45:29.700
I'm sorry, Bob.
She's out of town at the moment.

45:29.800 --> 45:32.300
Well, when will she be back?

45:32.400 --> 45:33.845
I'm not sure.

45:35.160 --> 45:36.540
Well, when will you know?

45:36.640 --> 45:39.900
I don't know, but I... I can
make a note to call you.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.809
Okay.

45:43.680 --> 45:46.860
Is there another girl
you'd be interested in?

45:46.960 --> 45:49.260
Did you look at Donna on our website?

45:49.360 --> 45:51.100
She's available.

45:51.200 --> 45:53.580
Donna, yeah.

45:53.680 --> 45:55.620
The brunette.

45:55.720 --> 45:56.700
Right.

45:56.800 --> 45:59.929
Yeah, that's fine.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.286
Sure.

46:05.320 --> 46:06.765
When?

46:08.200 --> 46:10.580
You know, I've been asking myself
what possible wisdom

46:10.680 --> 46:14.260
I can impart to the bright
young minds of tomorrow.

46:14.360 --> 46:17.540
And I was gonna say,
"Be anyone you want to be."

46:17.640 --> 46:20.769
If you want to be an attorney,
be an attorney.

46:23.160 --> 46:27.220
You want to be a ballerina,
be a ballerina.

46:27.320 --> 46:29.527
If you want to be a fireman,
be a fireman

46:29.640 --> 46:31.483
or an astronaut, or a playwright.

46:31.600 --> 46:34.700
Technology.
I mean, he can talk directly...

46:38.520 --> 46:41.980
But then I realized, that's ridiculous.

46:42.080 --> 46:45.280
When are we gonna talk about
ethics reform and campaign finance?

46:45.380 --> 46:49.900
I can't be a ballerina,

46:50.000 --> 46:54.580
an astronaut, or a playwright.

46:54.680 --> 46:56.728
I'm just not built that way.

46:58.040 --> 46:59.900
Because, really, you can only be you.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.620
Get your message across.

47:01.720 --> 47:04.060
But maybe that's what I'll impart.

47:04.160 --> 47:05.730
Be you.

47:05.840 --> 47:08.220
- Coaker's piece.
- Morning, Sam.

47:08.320 --> 47:12.300
Whoever that is.

47:12.400 --> 47:15.020
Be honest about your weaknesses,

47:15.120 --> 47:18.620
but capitalize on your strengths.

47:18.720 --> 47:21.849
Get to the core of who you really are,

47:22.680 --> 47:26.620
because the sooner
you figure out who that is,

47:26.720 --> 47:29.220
the sooner you can decide
which grad school

47:29.320 --> 47:31.020
to blow 100 grand on.

47:31.120 --> 47:32.770
Thank you.

48:04.320 --> 48:06.607
Does this bother you?

48:07.040 --> 48:08.724
- No.
- No?

48:09.440 --> 48:11.620
I can touch you any way I like?

48:11.720 --> 48:13.540
Uh-huh.

48:13.640 --> 48:14.721
Huh?

48:23.200 --> 48:25.931
What if some guy wanted
to cum in your eye?

48:27.040 --> 48:29.168
On those pretty lashes.

48:35.560 --> 48:37.130
You're so pretty.

48:38.760 --> 48:41.740
Why do you let guys do this shit to you?

48:41.840 --> 48:44.140
I don't know.

48:44.240 --> 48:46.700
It's just what some guys are like.

48:46.800 --> 48:49.485
Well, some guys aren't supposed to be.

48:52.440 --> 48:54.460
Especially in my line of work.

48:54.560 --> 48:57.900
Doesn't make a difference, does it?

48:58.000 --> 48:59.525
That's not the point.

49:02.480 --> 49:07.202
It's just basic human engineering.

49:08.120 --> 49:10.580
Fighting that really
make you a better person?

49:10.680 --> 49:12.940
The world doesn't work
the way it does when you're 19.

49:13.040 --> 49:14.140
You'll see.

49:14.240 --> 49:15.260
Oh, whatever.

49:15.360 --> 49:18.489
Rules are just rules someone made up.

49:18.600 --> 49:20.780
None of my clients are 19.

49:20.880 --> 49:22.540
And most of them are married.

49:22.640 --> 49:24.620
If that makes you feel any better.

49:24.720 --> 49:26.290
I didn't say I was married.

49:28.200 --> 49:29.645
Sorry.

49:30.440 --> 49:32.169
I talk too much.

49:33.480 --> 49:34.940
Don't get mad, okay?

49:35.040 --> 49:36.980
I just don't see why
pretending you're someone

49:37.080 --> 49:40.100
you're not makes you any better.
That's all.

49:40.200 --> 49:42.620
You sure you're okay doing this?

49:42.720 --> 49:43.540
I mean, come on.

49:43.640 --> 49:45.580
Isn't there something
better out there for you?

49:45.680 --> 49:49.002
Did you have
a favorite subject in school?

49:50.400 --> 49:52.243
I like what I do.

49:54.360 --> 49:55.930
And I like you.

50:00.480 --> 50:02.020
You want to see me again?

50:02.120 --> 50:04.780
I never see the same girl twice.

50:04.880 --> 50:06.803
Oh, poor Bob.

50:08.760 --> 50:10.728
It's okay to come out and play.

50:37.600 --> 50:40.220
We knew Sam was destined for politics,

50:40.320 --> 50:42.300
but I always thought
Jeannie would end up

50:42.400 --> 50:44.482
being a prosecutor.

50:44.600 --> 50:46.728
Really? Me? Wow.

50:47.400 --> 50:48.900
You're the one with the background.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.700
You could jump back
in any time you wanted.

50:50.800 --> 50:51.900
Probably.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.300
I just didn't realize
I'd miss James so much

50:54.400 --> 50:55.660
being in the office all day.

50:55.760 --> 50:56.580
I get it.

50:56.680 --> 50:58.125
Your charity work will look better

50:58.240 --> 50:59.540
on a first lady's résumé.

50:59.640 --> 51:00.620
Oh, god.

51:00.720 --> 51:02.245
No pressure, Sam.

51:06.520 --> 51:08.124
Who wants dessert?

51:12.440 --> 51:13.566
Sam.

51:14.800 --> 51:16.165
Come in.

51:18.720 --> 51:21.564
Pollan's calling
a press conference for next week.

51:21.680 --> 51:23.060
Thought you said we had a year.

51:23.160 --> 51:25.940
It doesn't matter what I thought.
I couldn't hold him off any longer.

51:26.040 --> 51:27.060
But what about Stiegel?

51:27.160 --> 51:29.260
Am I supposed to drop the case
in somebody else's lap?

51:29.360 --> 51:31.328
Pollan's got cancer.

51:31.440 --> 51:33.660
And it's getting worse.

51:33.760 --> 51:35.820
I'm... I'm sorry about that.

51:37.200 --> 51:40.620
Look, Sam, I... I know
you wanted to try that case,

51:40.720 --> 51:42.260
and I respect you for that,

51:42.360 --> 51:45.060
and I know that Kirkland's
probably gonna come down on you,

51:45.160 --> 51:47.660
but this field is gonna
get real crowded real fast

51:47.760 --> 51:48.980
once the news gets out.

51:49.080 --> 51:51.060
This is game time.

51:51.160 --> 51:53.540
You announce, Coaker writes his piece,

51:53.640 --> 51:54.820
you're the man to beat.

51:54.920 --> 51:55.967
Okay.

51:56.360 --> 51:59.020
"Okay"? Is your head in this?

51:59.120 --> 52:01.380
Yeah, I'm good. Just took me
by surprise, that's all.

52:01.480 --> 52:05.780
Well, this is the perfect time
to get used to surprises.

52:05.880 --> 52:08.180
You ought to get yourself
some bigger nuts.

52:08.280 --> 52:09.406
You got one week.

52:29.320 --> 52:30.500
Executive privilege.

52:30.600 --> 52:31.886
Yes, hello. This is Bob Fisher.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.843
I need to cancel
all my upcoming appointments.

52:33.960 --> 52:35.700
Things are a bit crazed right now.

52:35.800 --> 52:37.060
Oh, that's too bad, Bob.

52:37.160 --> 52:39.580
I have a note here from Clio
to tell you that she's in town.

52:39.680 --> 52:41.020
Just for three days, though.

52:41.120 --> 52:44.020
She knows you've been inquiring,
and she's willing to meet.

52:44.120 --> 52:45.740
Clio?

52:45.840 --> 52:50.100
Her schedule's almost full,
but she's free Tuesday.

52:50.200 --> 52:52.601
No, that's fine. Thank you.

52:56.480 --> 52:58.403
Constantino is running for sure.

52:58.520 --> 53:00.660
There's no way that's happening.

53:00.760 --> 53:02.340
Please give me another viable name.

53:02.440 --> 53:03.380
Bradford.

53:03.480 --> 53:04.481
- Bradford?
- Mm-hmm.

53:17.640 --> 53:18.980
I like your pictures. Noted.

53:19.080 --> 53:21.060
She's got charisma,
but she doesn't have money.

53:21.160 --> 53:22.340
She doesn't have donors.

53:22.440 --> 53:25.020
Constantino's gonna top
our million in commitments

53:25.120 --> 53:26.140
by the end of this week.

53:26.240 --> 53:27.420
Constantino.

53:27.520 --> 53:28.700
Running or not running?

53:28.800 --> 53:30.580
He'll run if I don't.

53:30.680 --> 53:33.220
Oh, I like the balls on this guy.

53:33.320 --> 53:35.220
This is what I like.
This is what we're selling.

53:35.320 --> 53:39.020
Confidence, hope, optimism
versus a three-time loser.

53:39.120 --> 53:41.140
Success versus failure, all right?

53:41.240 --> 53:44.030
Versus corruption, actually. Ideas?

53:44.130 --> 53:46.180
E.J.'s right, guys.
I think we need a platform

53:46.280 --> 53:47.848
before we want to start
getting the message out.

53:47.960 --> 53:50.220
I want to have the announcement
on a college campus.

53:50.320 --> 53:52.926
I want him surrounded by people
under 30. Yeah? Under 30.

53:53.040 --> 53:55.850
I want him swimming in people
under 30, you understand?

54:02.680 --> 54:03.740
Hello?

54:03.840 --> 54:07.500
Hi, is this Bob?

54:07.600 --> 54:08.700
Yes.

54:08.800 --> 54:09.940
Hey, it's Laci.

54:10.040 --> 54:12.540
I'm... I'm sorry to call you directly,

54:12.640 --> 54:14.740
but I might be changing agencies,

54:14.840 --> 54:17.020
and I just wanted you to have my number.

54:17.120 --> 54:18.087
Can you talk?

54:18.840 --> 54:20.285
Not exactly.

54:23.280 --> 54:24.860
I... I just wanted you to know

54:24.960 --> 54:27.540
how much I enjoyed the other day.

54:27.640 --> 54:31.042
And it'd be great to see you again.

54:34.120 --> 54:37.180
Okay, well, I... I have it now.

54:37.280 --> 54:38.740
Yeah.

54:38.840 --> 54:41.020
I'm sorry again.

54:41.120 --> 54:42.340
I hope I'll see you soon.

54:42.440 --> 54:43.540
Okay.

54:43.640 --> 54:44.971
Okay, bye.

54:52.040 --> 54:53.804
What phone was that?

54:55.560 --> 54:57.260
FBI phone.

54:57.360 --> 55:00.330
They heard something
on the wire, needed advice.

55:00.440 --> 55:02.740
I'll see you tonight, okay?

55:02.840 --> 55:04.205
Of course.

55:22.880 --> 55:24.820
They're kind of overpriced.

55:24.920 --> 55:27.526
That's the point. It's my treat.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.380
Isn't my wife a knockout?

55:30.480 --> 55:32.562
Yeah, very flattering.

55:32.680 --> 55:33.700
She gets self-conscious.

55:33.800 --> 55:36.300
I understand. A lot of women do.

55:36.400 --> 55:38.060
Where are you from?

55:38.160 --> 55:39.620
- Brazil.
- Brazil? Wow.

55:39.720 --> 55:41.420
Never been.

55:41.520 --> 55:42.500
I think you would like it.

55:42.600 --> 55:43.820
Probably would.

55:43.920 --> 55:45.020
What's your name?

55:45.120 --> 55:47.820
- Tora.
- Ah. Sam.

55:47.920 --> 55:49.820
Do you think they're too young for me?

55:49.920 --> 55:51.380
Not at all. They're stunning.

55:51.480 --> 55:52.606
We'll take them.

55:54.680 --> 55:56.500
You didn't miss anything
at the conference.

55:56.600 --> 55:58.180
Your son is a model student.

55:58.280 --> 55:59.566
Good.

56:02.480 --> 56:05.580
I'm sorry, sir,
but your card was declined.

56:05.680 --> 56:06.620
It was?

56:06.720 --> 56:08.060
It's probably just the machine.

56:08.160 --> 56:10.606
It happens every now and then.
Would you like me to call them?

56:10.720 --> 56:12.722
No, no, no. It's fine. Try this one.

56:14.520 --> 56:15.340
Hm.

56:15.440 --> 56:16.940
What have you been buying lately?

56:21.160 --> 56:22.810
Everything okay?

56:28.840 --> 56:30.380
What's going on, Sam?

56:30.480 --> 56:31.811
What?

56:33.080 --> 56:35.220
I thought we were having
a nice afternoon together.

56:35.320 --> 56:37.448
Yeah, I'm just not sure
why you felt that I needed

56:37.560 --> 56:40.820
a $400 pair of sunglasses
right at this exact moment.

56:40.920 --> 56:42.980
You know, Jeannie, I took
time out of my schedule,

56:43.080 --> 56:46.660
- I canceled an appointment. I just...
- With whom?

56:46.760 --> 56:49.420
Is this about the...
the Brazilian girl at the store?

56:50.175 --> 56:52.180
No.

56:52.280 --> 56:53.660
But now that you mention it,

56:53.760 --> 56:56.286
that was fucking embarrassing.

56:57.040 --> 56:59.020
If you really are going
to become a candidate...

56:59.120 --> 57:00.220
If I become a candidate?

57:00.320 --> 57:03.220
You're gonna have to learn to deal
with flattery from girls like that.

57:03.320 --> 57:05.180
You can't just buy
whatever shit they're selling.

57:05.280 --> 57:08.927
- What's bothering you? Just spit it out.
- Is there someone else?

57:13.760 --> 57:16.460
- No.
- I don't believe you. I'm sorry.

57:16.560 --> 57:19.180
Well, what am I supposed to do about it?

57:19.280 --> 57:21.328
There's nobody else.

58:33.400 --> 58:34.686
Come on.

58:39.600 --> 58:40.780
Executive Privilege.

58:40.880 --> 58:42.460
Yes, it's Bob Fisher.

58:42.560 --> 58:44.260
Does Clio still have
any times available?

58:44.360 --> 58:47.300
Hey, Bob. Yes, she does. Five o'clock.

58:47.400 --> 58:48.500
Today?

58:48.600 --> 58:51.700
Yes, today.
You want me to pencil you in?

58:51.800 --> 58:54.180
Okay, I'll take it. Where?

58:54.280 --> 58:57.640
We have two officers
that are gonna be contacts.

59:15.360 --> 59:16.566
How'd it go today?

59:16.680 --> 59:17.580
All right, I suppose.

59:17.680 --> 59:20.081
Sam's not exactly
an open book, but he's good.

59:20.200 --> 59:21.900
He's very, very good at what he does.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.860
It's only 4:30. He's done already?

59:23.960 --> 59:26.660
No, I think he's got a five o'clock.

59:26.760 --> 59:29.060
Outside the office.

59:29.160 --> 59:31.083
Get out of the fucking way!

59:37.520 --> 59:39.700
Hi, I need to check
the balance of my card.

59:39.800 --> 59:41.211
It was declined.

59:44.360 --> 59:46.620
All right, what are
my options for payment?

59:46.720 --> 59:48.688
2,000.

59:50.280 --> 59:52.009
Can I open a line of credit?

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:10.531
Fuck!

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:19.780
Shit!

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:21.086
Sorry.

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.291
Come on.

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.300
Are you all right?

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.260
You okay? Hey, just stay down.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.580
- No.
- You sure?

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:46.727
Call 911.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.611
Hey!

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:14.886
Executive Privilege.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:15.980
Hi, this is Bob Fisher.

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.180
I'm not gonna be able
to make my appointment today,

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.380
but I...

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.940
I... I think you may be
under investigation.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.740
I don't know, I just...

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:27.660
I think they have
surveillance at Clio's hotel.

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.250
I could be wrong.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.927
Can you help us?

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.060
Help you?

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.180
No. No, I can't. I'm sorry.

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.540
Just destroy your records.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.700
Just do whatever you need to do.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.245
Just disappear.

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:01.860
Hello.

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:05.340
Please don't hang up, Mr. Ellis.

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:07.060
I'm asking as a friend.

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.220
Can you help us?

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.283
Who is she, Sam?

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.700
What happened? Why were you
at the Saint Regency Hotel?

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.900
You can interrogate me later.
Just let me rest.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.580
Sure.

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:01.940
Give you time to prep, right?

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.485
Jeannie, please.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.202
This? What the fuck is this?

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:09.620
Hmm?

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:11.940
Hush money for your girlfriend?

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:13.380
It's...

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:14.686
It's a donation.

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:17.780
You don't treat me

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:21.380
like some stupid
suburban housewife, Sam.

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:24.060
I outpaced you
in every fucking law class.

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:27.687
I was earning a higher salary
than you until...

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.564
Fuck me.

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:32.180
I don't understand.
You're my best friend.

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:34.851
You don't do this kind of thing.
Not to me.

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:38.940
The nurse said you fractured a rib.

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:41.088
I wouldn't move too much.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:49.820
What am I supposed to do?
Do I... should I leave?

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.460
'Cause I won't be the victim here.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:52.900
You saw what that did to my parents.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.340
I'll walk before that happens.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:55.420
We're not your parents.

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:58.126
Then get it together.

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.340
If not for me, do it for James.

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:03.180
He looks to you for how to behave.

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:06.500
And whatever mess you're in,

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:08.900
you need to dig yourself out of it now.

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:12.089
I'm going to get our son.

01:05:41.174 --> 01:05:43.960
We're sorry. You have reached a number
that has been disconnected

01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:47.180
or is no longer in service.

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:50.300
Hello.

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.020
Noah, it's Sam. I need you to check
something out for me.

01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:55.122
Sure. What's up?

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:01.846
Nigel Coaker called three times.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.060
I don't want to talk to him.

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:06.580
Noah's in your office
with the meeting you asked for.

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:07.806
Okay.

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.060
It's been mostly FBI so far.

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:11.900
We've handled a couple of warrants.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.340
They put in a request for a wire,

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:14.660
but I think it's too late.

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:16.125
The agency's rolling up fast.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:17.340
What do we know?

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.820
Some interstate,
some international activity.

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:21.524
For the right price, a V.I.P. client

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:24.300
could bring a prostitute
to New York or Paris.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.620
At the very least, I think
we've got them on the Mann Act.

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.700
You sure about that?

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:31.100
Not 100%.

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.460
And the agents want to move now?

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:33.420
Who's on it?

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:35.980
Park and Strellitz, solid guys.

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:39.100
They don't want to see it slip away.

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:41.900
Well, I want to come
on board and help out.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.140
And I'll lead the case.

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:46.700
Is there a reason
you would need to, sir?

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:47.580
Is there a problem?

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:50.620
No. It's your call, of course.

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:54.700
It's just I was hoping to try
the case if it came to that.

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:55.660
Ah.

01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:57.540
I used to volunteer at a clinic

01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.660
that helped prostitutes
get out and get clean,

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:02.580
and I saw a lot of girls
go through there.

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:05.460
Even at the high end, there's a pretty
intense psychological toll.

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:07.620
I think what Flynn
is trying to say, sir,

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.740
is that we'd like to stay on the case

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:12.980
unless there's a compelling
reason for us to switch.

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.820
You sure you want
to spend your time on this?

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:18.491
You think I'm chasing headlines?
Is that it?

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.060
You're right, Ms. Flynn.

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:26.180
It is an important issue.

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:27.900
And that's why I want
to be more involved.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.020
I want to make sure
it stays on the right track.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:32.500
And if it goes to trial,

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:34.489
you can have the case. Fair deal?

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.260
All right, tell the agents
we're transferring the case.

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.980
I want to see them in here
at their earliest convenience.

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.764
Noah, hang back a sec.

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:49.060
A buddy at the bureau
slipped me the lead on this,

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:52.260
and I don't want to burn him,
so if anyone asks,

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:54.100
I heard about it from you, okay?

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.326
You got it, chief.

01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:52.122
James, honey, no.

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:59.926
Otherwise, they're gonna
keep you back in that class.

01:09:15.479 --> 01:09:16.979
You okay?

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:18.500
Yeah.

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:19.725
Fine.

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:20.979
Can I take this?

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.319
Sure. Already read it.

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:28.087
Okay.

01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:31.020
See you tonight.

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:32.689
Okay.

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.380
Word is the FBI sent it
upstairs yesterday.

01:09:47.479 --> 01:09:48.819
Why the fuck would they do that?

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.740
Look, I talked to my buddy
at main justice.

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:51.859
He said they split it.

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.260
They bumped the case to New York,

01:09:53.359 --> 01:09:55.580
and the rest is going to OPR,
which only happens

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:57.660
if someone in this office
is implicated, right?

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:58.580
Jesus.

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:00.125
Any idea who that might be?

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:05.807
You know, Noah, I'm gonna call you back.

01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:32.251
Jesus.

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:54.367
Hey. I know you called. Leave a message.

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:13.140
Detective Brixy.

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:14.260
Brixy, Sam Ellis.

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:15.540
Ellis, how you doing, man?

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:17.220
You gonna nail Stiegel to the wall?

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.140
You are a regular
fucking hero down here, man.

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:21.100
Yeah, I know. Thanks.

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:23.660
Couldn't have done it without
some solid police work, right?

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:25.420
I... I need you to run a number for me.

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:26.885
I need an address.

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:51.891
Can I help you?

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:58.140
Yes. I... is Jennifer here?

01:11:58.240 --> 01:11:59.220
Just a second.

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:00.606
Thank you.

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:11.611
Hi.

01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:13.484
I'm sorry to bother you here.

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.940
It's Jennifer, right?

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.500
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:19.740
Can I come in?

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:20.660
My mom's in there.

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:22.580
It's really, really important.

01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:25.160
Is there somewhere else
we can talk, then?

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:31.122
They already brought me in
for questioning this morning.

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.820
It sucked. Cops really creep me out.

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:37.060
What did they ask you?

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:39.624
They said I can't discuss that.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:43.806
Listen, you need to get
a message to the agency.

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:47.100
You need to tell them not to volunteer
any information, okay?

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.340
The FBI doesn't have a case.

01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:50.220
- Everybody's in custody.
- It doesn't...

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:51.900
No, I mean they got every single person.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.340
You have to think of a way, though.

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:55.568
There has to be some way
to get in touch with somebody.

01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:57.260
There's nothing. No, I'm...

01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:59.540
- What about the book?
- There is nothing. They're gone.

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:02.180
- Can you text somebody? One of the other girls?
- What the fuck, man?

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:04.540
You think they're just gonna
use up their one phone call

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:06.580
- to see how Laci's doing?
- Just think! Just think!

01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:10.940
- Just think of everybody for me! Help me out!
- There is nothing! They are gone!

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:12.060
Fuck.

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:15.220
I never even spoke to them in person.

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.004
It was all just over the phone.

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:19.580
Fuck. I am so fucked.

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:22.286
This is...
I shouldn't have said anything.

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.842
You don't have anything to worry about.

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:45.020
I recognize you, you know.

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:48.920
You're a lot better looking
in person than you are on TV.

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:56.084
I was gonna go poli-sci
before my mom got diagnosed.

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:06.688
She has cancer, doesn't she?

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:14.130
My mom died from cancer
when I was about your age.

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:21.845
You guys close?

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:26.690
Yeah.

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:32.127
She was kind of out of control.

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:34.606
But...

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:40.246
I just got into this to help her out.

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:43.846
I'm all she's got.

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:52.300
But once you're at the party...

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.482
You should get out.

01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:00.207
I... I already switched agencies.

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:04.980
These guys have been
courting me for a while.

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:07.287
They're super discrete.

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:22.400
It's okay.

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:36.500
- It's all good, right?
- Yeah.

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:38.340
You don't have to worry about anything.

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.124
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:42.486
Wait.

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:46.730
Can we...

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:51.207
I've got...

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.330
That's all I got.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.685
I can go to the bank after if you want.

01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:08.521
Right here?

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:11.486
Yeah.

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:55.340
Sorry I'm late.

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.442
All rise.

01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:00.540
The honorable Catherine Liu presiding.

01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:04.540
Well, we're off to a roaring start.

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:08.020
Apologize for the delay, Your Honor.

01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:09.500
Be seated.

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.060
Not you, Mr. Ellis.

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:13.260
You're not going to be here that long.

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:15.089
Let's hear your motions.

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:18.769
Right.

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:31.740
Hey, there's two FBI agents
that want to speak to you.

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:33.620
I put them in your office.
I hope that's okay.

01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:35.220
That's fine. Thank you, Dalia.

01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:38.260
And next Friday's my last day.

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:39.850
I don't know if you knew that.

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:42.980
Let us know where you land.

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:45.900
And I wanted to apologize.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.500
I never meant to complicate
your life or... or your wife's.

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:50.125
You didn't.

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.940
- Gentlemen.
- Mr. Ellis.

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.820
- Sam Ellis.
- Agent Park.

01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:59.860
I'm Agent Strellitz. Agent Park.

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:01.420
Have a seat.

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:03.380
You know why we're here?

01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:04.891
You tell me.

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:09.460
Why'd this get passed up to main?

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:14.220
How familiar are you
with Executive Privilege?

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:15.540
Not very.

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:18.180
I stepped in 'cause
I was concerned about

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.780
some of the warrants y'all asked for.

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:21.540
How did you hear about the case?

01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:24.860
Noah, one of my AUSAs told me about it.

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:28.220
Our investigation started
with a particular elected official

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:30.300
moving large sums of money around.

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.300
We thought he might be embezzling funds.

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.340
Turns out he was a client at the agency.

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:35.740
Hmm.

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:39.540
Started to build a list.
High-profile public officials, mostly state.

01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:41.260
All of whom are clients
and many of whom...

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:42.660
And many of whom

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:45.764
were social friends
of a colleague of yours here.

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:50.620
Kirkland?

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:54.700
We think maybe they asked him
to hold up the investigation.

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.620
Has he ever mentioned the case to you?

01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:58.460
No. Not at all.

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:01.980
He ever mention the agency
or prostitution in general?

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:04.140
Maybe the occasional off-color comment.

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:05.660
We're using an escort as a witness

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.260
on an unrelated identity theft case,

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:11.420
but I believe she worked
for a different agency.

01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:14.900
And you yourself
have never had any contact

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.900
with the agency or any of its employees?

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.220
Not that I'm aware of.

01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:25.900
You were in the hospital
on Tuesday, is that correct?

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.060
Yes, I was hit by a car
crossing the street.

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:30.660
Then you passed out four blocks
from the Saint Regency Hotel.

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.420
I'm not really sure where I passed out.

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:34.420
The police report could clarify that.

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:37.126
I'd be careful here, fellas.

01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:41.084
Do you have a case?

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:44.850
'Cause it sounds like you're fishing.

01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:48.660
That's exactly why I wanted
to check the warrants.

01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:50.100
If you have any information

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:51.860
that could assist the investigation,

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:55.260
- We'd be extremely...
- Do you have a case?

01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:58.603
We suspect that
someone tipped the agency.

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:01.820
They started rolling up,
destroying all their records.

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:04.220
That's why we moved in.

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:06.926
But we think we were too late.

01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:09.041
Okay.

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:13.089
So, you gonna charge them
with something?

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:19.491
No.

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:25.608
Well, hopefully
you'll get them next time.

01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:27.810
Y'all should've come to me first.

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:32.688
- It was nice to meet you.
- Mm-hmm.

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:34.131
Mm-hmm.

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:42.380
Are you a married man, Mr. Ellis?

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:45.780
13 years.

01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:48.281
I'm married 38 years myself.

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:51.860
I've seen every kind of husband.

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:53.860
Heard every justification
you can imagine

01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:56.980
for every sort of indiscretion.

01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:58.620
Guys telling themselves

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:02.140
it's just a little vacation
from reality.

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:07.246
Or that they're some other guy
when they step into that room.

01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:12.100
But I have seen grown men break down

01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:15.820
and cry when the chickens come home.

01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:17.820
Even if you're getting away with it,

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:21.220
you only get to be one person
under the eyes of god.

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:22.900
And these guys,

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.740
they got to be asking themselves
at the end of the day

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:32.244
if you're the guy
that walks through that door

01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:33.691
or if you're not.

01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:38.170
Have a good day, counselor.

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:24.048
You know, they say that
jogging is shit for the knees.

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:26.220
So I hear.

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:28.340
You followed me?

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:30.620
You want to grab a coffee?

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:32.404
We need to have a chat.

01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:36.883
How's your lovely wife?

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.900
She's probably sitting
a lot more than I have lately.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.482
I heard you had a visit
from the FBI today.

01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:48.220
They were briefing me on a case.

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:51.130
Mm. Is that all?

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:54.580
That's funny 'cause my sources

01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:56.887
said it was a little bit more than that.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.460
Yeah?

01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:00.925
What did they say?

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:09.770
I think you know.

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:12.446
Hmm?

01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:18.580
You know they haven't got
a case against you, Sam,

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:21.100
and there's no doubt
the pressure from the top

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:24.060
will get them to drop it.

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:27.340
And from where I sit, I still
think people have the right

01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:32.580
to know the truth
about their assistant U.S. Attorney

01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:36.685
and aspiring future congressman.

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.682
You know, it's really the hypocrisy

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:02.860
that offends most people,

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:05.460
and you're quite good
at fooling everyone.

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:09.660
But soon, people are gonna
know what you really are.

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:12.684
Then they can make up
their own mind about it.

01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:17.420
Now, I want to give you the chance

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:21.140
to tell me your own story and maybe...

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:24.700
maybe they will forgive you

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:26.300
if you make them understand.

01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:27.980
When are you running the piece?

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:29.206
Soon.

01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:40.206
I have nothing to say at this time.

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.683
Edward Pollan, the three-term senator

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:45.820
announced today
that he intends to retire

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:48.140
at the end of the current
legislative session.

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:50.860
The unexpected decision
leaves the playing field wide open

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:54.140
given Pollan's
17-year tenure in the office.

01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:57.220
Normally one
of the Senate's most outspoken...

01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:04.540
Yeah.

01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:07.086
Yeah. Want cheese on your burger?

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:08.260
Yeah.

01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:09.566
Yeah.

01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:12.006
Hi, Mom.

01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:19.366
Here you go.

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:22.900
Can I give Jack a lettuce leaf?

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.606
Sure. Just wash your hands, okay?

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.481
So, where have you been?

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:34.206
Around.

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:39.700
I saw the announcement.
You talk to Hiller?

01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:40.926
Not yet.

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:44.780
He wanted some
photographs of your mother

01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:50.125
for the website.
There's a box in my office.

01:27:56.575 --> 01:27:58.521
Back to business.

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:03.060
Something wrong?

01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:06.687
No, sweetie. Just... just hungry.

01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:56.485
Thank you.

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:04.810
Just take your time.

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:20.980
If I talk to you, will you
give me time to resign

01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:23.100
and get my affairs in order?

01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:26.580
That's a poor choice of words, but okay.

01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:38.940
Well, first, I... I want
to apologize to my family,

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:42.460
to my wife and son

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:44.620
and my colleagues
at the U.S. Attorney's office,

01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:48.020
with whom it has been a great honor

01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:50.043
and privilege to serve.

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:53.729
There are no excuses.

01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:03.100
Why take the risk?

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:10.451
I don't know.

01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:18.043
I don't know. It's gonna take me
a long time to figure out.

01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:21.485
Jeannie thinks the world of you.

01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:25.195
Off the record.

01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:28.807
How are you gonna break it to her?

01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:33.980
Well, she already knows, I think.

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.491
You think?

01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:46.340
Why do we hold public servants to a...

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:50.420
to a higher standard when it comes
to marriage and fidelity?

01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:53.171
We're flawed like everyone else.

01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:59.522
I set out to help people.

01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:02.291
I never said I was better than them.

01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:10.687
Go talk to your wife.

01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:22.888
Jeannie, we need to talk.

01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:30.000
It's over.

01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:32.842
I'm gonna resign tomorrow.

01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:37.841
What? Why?

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:41.162
Coaker knows.

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:43.525
Knows what?

01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:48.890
Come on, Jeannie. You already know.

01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:52.081
What is it I'm supposed to know?

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:56.328
You want me to say it?

01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:07.620
For the past few months...

01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:11.281
I've been a client of an escort agency.

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:16.564
"Been a client?"

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.162
How would you want me to say it?

01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:30.281
You make it sound so clean.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.580
I have been so afraid that somebody

01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:38.286
would find out that now I feel I...

01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:41.380
I don't know. I feel relieved.

01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:43.323
I know that sounds horrible.

01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:48.220
When this blows over,
I'll get a job on the civil side.

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:51.140
Something with less hours and more money

01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:55.020
so I can spend more time
with you and James.

01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:58.740
Maybe you can go back to practicing law,
if that's something that you wanted.

01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:03.300
Jeannie, I need your help.
I'm splitting apart here.

01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:05.607
- I can't imagine...
- Just shut up!

01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:13.620
What are we talking about here?

01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:15.961
How many other girls did you fuck?

01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:18.860
Five, ten? I mean, you can tell me.

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:22.567
Do you not think the wife
has a right to know?

01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:25.660
What was it like with them?

01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:27.000
I don't know, Jeannie.

01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:27.962
You don't know?

01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:30.620
Why didn't you just have an affair, Sam?

01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:33.980
That was my worst fear all along.

01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:37.163
But that... that would've
made you human.

01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:42.300
This makes you sick that
you view women that way.

01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:43.980
And there isn't one person I can blame,

01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:45.820
Not one bitch I can point the finger at.

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:48.620
- You didn't even give me that!
- Sorry.

01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:50.300
If life with us was so fucking terrible,

01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:51.980
why didn't you just fucking go?

01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:53.740
I didn't want that. I never wanted that.

01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:56.380
Then what, Sam? Help me understand.

01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:00.540
Was our routine so stifling?
Was that it?

01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:02.380
Was it your crazy mama
who wanted you to be

01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:04.260
the next Kennedy?
Was it me? Was it my dad?

01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:06.660
I know he talks down to you,
but he put a roof over our heads.

01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:08.380
- He started your political career.
- Okay.

01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:09.900
Thank you. Thanks for reminding me.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.300
You know, I felt suffocated,
too, but you know what I did?

01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:16.020
I started a fucking
vegetable garden. But you...

01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:18.261
You couldn't even talk to one journalist
without destroying

01:34:18.361 --> 01:34:21.240
- everything we worked for.
- He already knew, Jeannie. He already knew.

01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:23.820
You think you can do any better?
I'd like to see you try.

01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:26.980
Riding me is not the same
as doing it yourself.

01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:29.860
Coaker never liked me. He was
doing this for you and your father.

01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:33.020
So it's my fault now?
So, we should all feel sorry for you?

01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:34.900
I never asked anybody
to feel sorry for me.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:39.500
Please tell me it was worth it
for that few minutes of excitement.

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:42.206
Or is that why you did it?

01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:45.700
So you could have a secret from me.

01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:47.260
From everyone who believed in you.

01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:49.408
Well, at least it was mine.

01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:21.500
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:22.900
It's okay, buddy.

01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:46.481
I suppose you'd like to come in.

01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:04.045
How'd you find out?

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.243
Just because I'm old
doesn't mean I'm lazy.

01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:16.651
Here you go.

01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:22.646
That a girl.

01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:25.324
Don't write the piece.

01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:44.860
It's a matter of time
before he brings himself down.

01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:46.660
That doesn't mean
you have to humiliate me

01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:48.660
in front of the entire world,
in front of my son.

01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:50.980
If it's not me, it'll be
someone else eventually.

01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:52.127
Let it be somebody else.

01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:54.260
- Why the fuck should I?
- 'Cause I'm asking you to.

01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:56.740
I didn't want to write the piece
in the first place.

01:36:56.840 --> 01:36:59.540
Now it's getting interesting,
and you want me to stop?

01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:02.980
Look, I realize it's your job,
but is it worth destroying my family

01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:04.500
to sell a few fucking magazines?

01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:07.500
I didn't break the law.

01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:09.740
Whereas you, my dear,
now, you just found out

01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:11.940
your husband's fucking prostitutes.

01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:13.340
Now all you can do is defend him?

01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:16.420
How many students did you fuck
in exchange for better grades?

01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:18.204
I mean, is it really any different?

01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:20.288
This ain't about me, right?

01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:25.740
This is about you protecting
your ticket to the top.

01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:28.420
I mean, that's all
you really care about.

01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:30.820
I don't think you're really
bothered about any of them

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:32.900
other women, I mean,
'cause you're just like him.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.900
I mean, what does he do?
Does he pull your hair?

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.620
Does he talk filth to you?

01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:39.820
Or are you content
to allow his young whores

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:41.620
to do as they will with him?

01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:44.610
Just as long as you can
sit on that fucking throne.

01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:52.041
Oh.

01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:55.300
You're your father's girl, yeah?

01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:57.420
Now I know I'm digging
in the right place.

01:37:57.520 --> 01:37:58.620
Fuck you.

01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:00.140
Anytime, Jeannie.

01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:03.500
Since you were 16.

01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:05.364
Any fucking time.

01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:09.611
Okay.

01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:13.740
I beg your pardon?

01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:15.683
Call it an even trade.

01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:18.380
What?

01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:20.180
We both know
you haven't been staring at me

01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:24.460
since I was 16, Nigel. More like 13.

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:26.767
I'm still the same girl, so...

01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:31.327
Come on, what do you say?

01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:23.961
Coaker's not gonna run the story.

01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:34.060
What did you do?

01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:37.460
Remember everything we talked about?

01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:39.340
Remember all the goals
we set for ourselves?

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:41.169
Let's not throw that away.

01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:47.760
But what if I can't do it anymore?

01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:51.521
Bit late for that, don't you think?

01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:03.441
I didn't think you had it in you.

01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:07.844
Go to hell, Sam.

01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:21.420
Just let me ask you one thing.

01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:23.841
What did they have that I don't?

01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:29.846
Nothing.

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:44.969
Sir, you wanted to see me?

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.445
Have a seat.

01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:57.380
I know the FBI asked you about me, Sam.

01:40:57.480 --> 01:40:59.620
I'm sorry about that whole mess.

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:01.820
They were just grasping at straws.

01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:03.524
Shouldn't have happened.

01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:11.740
Listen, I know you're gonna
go after Pollan's seat.

01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:13.900
Well, I haven't officially
decided anything yet.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:19.060
Just wanted you to know
that I'm all for it.

01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:21.820
We need guys like you in D.C.

01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:24.127
Still see things clearly.

01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:30.520
You been at it as long as I have,
everything looks grey and murky.

01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:34.084
Thank you, sir.

01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:43.091
Fucking "A."

01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:46.445
Look at that.

01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:56.660
- Wow.
- Hmm.

01:41:56.760 --> 01:41:58.888
Better than we could've imagined.

01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:22.010
Senator?

01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:26.380
Senator?

01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:27.380
Your wife just called.

01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:29.380
She won't be able to make it on Tuesday,

01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:32.020
but she'll be coming down
for the Governor's Ball on Saturday.

01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:33.660
All right, that's fine.

01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:35.980
Just make sure she has
a pick up at the airport.

01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:37.180
Yes, sir.

01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:38.620
Do you want us to come in with you?

01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:39.940
No.

01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:42.820
We have some
private business to discuss.

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:45.207
You go have lunch.
I'll call you when we're finished.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:55.300
Senator.

01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:56.606
George.

01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:02.460
Good to see you.

01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:03.580
Coffee?

01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:05.940
No. Kicked the habit.

01:43:06.772 --> 01:43:10.580
- Everything in moderation, huh?
- That's right.

01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:12.700
How's the family?
Your son doing all right?

01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:15.540
Can't run him for congress till he's 25.

01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:17.288
Well, we'll see.

01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:20.284
So, you liking it up here?

01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:22.340
Well, Jeannie doesn't love it,

01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:25.300
but her charity keeps her
at home mostly.

01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:28.140
I like D.C. It suits me.

01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:29.700
Good.

01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:33.791
'Cause you might be here for a long time
if I have anything to say about it.

01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:37.500
Reelection campaign headquarters
are opening up next week,

01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:39.860
and I talked to the governor
this morning.

01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:42.540
You can expect a formal endorsement.

01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:44.060
Glad to hear it.

01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:47.540
Sam, I do want to talk to you, though,

01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:49.540
about your...

01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:51.722
your zipper problem.

01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:57.660
Now, it doesn't surprise me.

01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:02.900
And I don't really care
what you do in your spare time.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.540
But the day you signed on for this,

01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:10.380
you put your life on probation.

01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:14.420
Your time on this planet
as a human being

01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:19.780
who eats and shits
and fucks like the rest of us,

01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:21.740
that's over.

01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:26.260
You got a patriotic duty
to be squeaky clean

01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:29.980
for these people who would
turn on you on a dime,

01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:32.765
and that is the contract.

01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:38.540
There may be some people
who want the truth...

01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:41.500
in a courtroom.

01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.300
But outside,

01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:48.691
they want to believe that you're somehow
better than they are.

01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:51.140
They need that fairytale.

01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:54.340
It's the only thing that
society has to keep it

01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:59.020
from sinking into the muck.

01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:03.284
That and wise policy.

01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:07.460
It's under control.

01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:10.040
That's all behind me now.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.380
Well, that's...
that's all I wanted to hear.

01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:19.140
I suppose that
if we ruled out every candidate

01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:21.940
who ever stepped out on his wife,

01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:25.560
it'd be just pussy-whipped nerds
running the country.

01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:28.009
We don't want that, do we?

01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:32.931
People still need heroes.

01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:36.020
Let's give them one.

01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:37.406
Good.

01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:42.820
Now, here's the first round
of donations from our friends

01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:44.843
and that's just the beginning.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.300
And, Sam,

01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:57.780
I wouldn't spend a lot of time
on ethics reform right now.

01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:01.300
You don't want to make
a lot of promises on that.

01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:03.700
And besides, you got
a lot of other subjects

01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:06.260
that you can tackle first.

01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:10.000
Well, I don't know about you, George,
but I can handle two things at once.

01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:14.300
You are a quick study, Ellis.

01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:15.606
You'll do all right.
