WEBVTT

00:04.805 --> 00:08.309
Well, thank you,
that's terrific. Okay.

00:08.342 --> 00:12.146
Hey, the Griddle Café
just donated a--a brunch
to my charity auction.

00:12.180 --> 00:15.549
That oughta go like...
well, like hotcakes.

00:15.583 --> 00:19.153
This auction looks great.

00:19.187 --> 00:21.322
- Ah! A gay cruise to Key West.
- Uh-huh.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.190
I want that!

00:24.525 --> 00:26.160
Who am I kidding?

00:26.194 --> 00:28.529
A boat full of hot gay guys
and an open bar,

00:28.562 --> 00:31.031
I might as well
put on a bathing suit,
start cryin' now.

00:33.334 --> 00:36.270
What's goin' on, Will?
¿Qué pasta?

00:36.304 --> 00:39.107
Oh, my--my charity's putting on
an autumn carnival

00:39.140 --> 00:40.308
and I'm in charge
of the live auction.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.143
All right.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.447
I see
what you're tryin' to do.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.282
You want me
to donate a dinner

00:48.316 --> 00:50.451
with Jack McFarland,
host of Jack Talk.

00:52.253 --> 00:55.456
Nice try, but yes.

00:57.225 --> 00:59.427
Eh, why not?

00:59.460 --> 01:01.462
I've got a 200-dollar dinner
at the Gotham Bar and Grill,

01:01.495 --> 01:05.133
I'll just make it
the "Gotham Bar and Girl."

01:05.166 --> 01:07.401
You're welcome.

01:07.435 --> 01:12.173
So, honey, Malcolm and I
are really excited to go
to your autumn carnival.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.875
Oh, and, uh, by the way,
if you talk to Stan,

01:14.908 --> 01:16.377
I'm at
the Star Trek convention

01:16.410 --> 01:18.646
in Anaheim
until Monday morning.

01:18.679 --> 01:21.282
Wait, you're still
seeing Malcolm?

01:21.315 --> 01:22.516
I thought you were
gonna break up with him

01:22.550 --> 01:23.551
now that you're back
with Stan.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.386
Honey,
I know, but I can't!

01:25.419 --> 01:27.688
He's such a sweet man,
and...

01:27.721 --> 01:30.458
well, you know me.

01:30.491 --> 01:32.860
If there is one thing
I cannot do,

01:32.893 --> 01:36.096
it is hurt
another person's feelings.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.468
JACK:
That is so true, Karen.

01:40.501 --> 01:43.237
You do have a kind heart.

01:43.271 --> 01:44.672
I'm sorry, honey,
I don't know what it is,

01:44.705 --> 01:46.307
but your
faggy little voice

01:46.340 --> 01:48.142
is just goin'
right through me today.

01:48.176 --> 01:51.145
( theme song )

02:09.830 --> 02:11.532
Hi, Grace.

02:11.565 --> 02:14.268
Nice wrap dress.

02:14.302 --> 02:17.671
That Diane Von Furstenberg
really knows a woman's body.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.575
Vivienne Westwood,
she'd look good on you, too.

02:26.614 --> 02:28.682
I'm sorry, when
did we become girlfriends?

02:30.284 --> 02:33.687
Grace,
can I ask your advice?

02:33.721 --> 02:36.790
I'd like to come up
with something really special
that I could do for Karen...

02:41.695 --> 02:43.397
to show her
how much she means to me.

02:43.431 --> 02:46.200
And I was thinking
of having her name
tattooed on my chest,

02:46.234 --> 02:48.769
real big, right here,
nip to nip.

02:52.440 --> 02:57.311
Yeah,
I wouldn't do that.

02:57.345 --> 02:58.679
Why not,
because they're uneven?

02:58.712 --> 03:00.681
'Cause I'm cool
with it being diagonal.

03:03.884 --> 03:06.654
Yeah,
I still wouldn't do it.

03:06.687 --> 03:07.921
Why not?

03:07.955 --> 03:10.691
I shouldn't say.
It's between you
and Karen.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.226
- Grace,
what are you talking about?
- Malcolm, I really don't...

03:12.260 --> 03:15.696
Grace, you know something
and you're going to tell me.

03:15.729 --> 03:18.266
I am skilled in many forms
of interrogation,

03:18.299 --> 03:20.601
including physical torture,
sleep deprivation,

03:20.634 --> 03:21.769
- and Jewish guilt.
- Okay.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.707
Karen's back with Stan.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.243
They worked things out,
and now she's seeing
both of you.

03:29.277 --> 03:31.445
Wow.

03:31.479 --> 03:32.946
Well, why wouldn't
she tell me herself?

03:32.980 --> 03:34.715
I mean, I thought
she cared about me.

03:34.748 --> 03:37.418
Just yesterday,
we did it, like, 50 times.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.755
She does care about you.

03:41.789 --> 03:43.791
Really, 50?

03:45.459 --> 03:49.297
God, she types up one memo
and she needs a nap.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.701
Thank you, Grace,
but I think I need to be alone.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.705
Please go.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.677
- This is kind of my office.
- I said go.

04:07.881 --> 04:10.818
Hi, Autumn Carnival,
benefiting
Project Angel Food.

04:10.851 --> 04:13.287
Or in your case,
"Project Angel Tush."

04:15.389 --> 04:17.758
Will, America doesn't like
to think of you as sexual.

04:20.394 --> 04:22.930
WOMAN:
On your left, ladies,
on your left!

04:22.963 --> 04:24.798
Rosie!

04:24.832 --> 04:25.933
- Uh.
- What are you doin' here?

04:25.966 --> 04:27.968
Well, since Miss Karen
fired me,

04:28.001 --> 04:30.404
I've been bar-backing
in this dump.

04:30.438 --> 04:34.342
- Well, Rosie, that looks
heavy, let me help you.
- Oh.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.313
So, Rosie,
how's the crowd?

04:39.347 --> 04:41.815
- Am I, like, the biggest star
in the room?
- Probably.

04:41.849 --> 04:42.883
It's either you
or that twink

04:42.916 --> 04:45.886
who fell down a hole
in the Eighties.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.856
Baby Glenn?

04:48.889 --> 04:50.791
Wow. He spent three days
in that hole.

04:50.824 --> 04:53.894
I remember watching
his rescue on TV.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.095
Oh, yeah.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.997
For weeks after that,

04:57.030 --> 04:59.967
I would dress
Malibu Ken up as a fireman,
get in my hamper,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.736
and have my mother
lower him down to me
on a piece of string.

05:04.838 --> 05:07.475
Sometimes I do blame
the parents.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.750
So Baby Glenn is gay?

05:16.784 --> 05:19.119
Yeah, they did a story
on Homo Extra.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.988
I think they called it, uh,

05:21.021 --> 05:23.524
"Baby Glenn, Out of One Hole
and Into Another."

05:25.593 --> 05:26.827
Which I just got.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.498
Hey, you should get him
for your auction.

05:30.531 --> 05:32.466
You need
another celebrity.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.502
I can't carry
the whole gay community
on my back.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.575
Though I admire you
for trying.

05:44.445 --> 05:47.748
I just--I don't know
how star-studded
I want this thing to be.

05:47.781 --> 05:50.784
I mean, you know,
do I want one person that
no one's heard of, or two?

05:52.786 --> 05:55.956
Maybe I should date him.

05:55.989 --> 06:00.060
When a celebrity
dates a celebrity,
their fame multiplies.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.129
I must talk
to this Baby Glenn.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.832
- Well, you're in luck,
'cause, uh, here he comes.
- Okay, back away.

06:04.865 --> 06:08.101
It's a very delicate dance,
this pas de deux
of the elite.

06:08.135 --> 06:11.505
I must finesse
what I'm going to say.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.541
I host a gay talk show.

06:13.574 --> 06:14.508
- I fell in a hole.
- Wanna date?

06:14.542 --> 06:15.509
- Sure.
- Great.

06:17.945 --> 06:19.513
What's up? Baby Glenn.

06:19.547 --> 06:22.516
Oh, you--you still
go by "Baby Glenn"?

06:22.550 --> 06:24.485
Uh, yeah.
( chuckles )

06:24.518 --> 06:26.186
You--you sort of
have to stick with
the name you've got

06:26.219 --> 06:29.056
once you become
internationally famous,
so...

06:29.089 --> 06:32.493
Are you that famous?

06:32.526 --> 06:34.895
I thought people
mostly knew you
that week you tripped.

06:36.664 --> 06:39.032
Ah, lover,
my friend here

06:39.066 --> 06:41.869
would like
to auction you off
at his event.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.471
Sure, I'll do it.

06:43.504 --> 06:44.605
Baby Jessica's doing
The View,

06:44.638 --> 06:46.139
and I gotta keep up
with that bitch.

06:51.178 --> 06:53.481
Hey, Karen.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.215
Don't you "Hey, Karen" me.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.951
You just had to stick
your nose job

06:57.985 --> 06:59.653
where it didn't belong,
didn't ya?

07:01.655 --> 07:03.857
I'm sorry, Karen!

07:03.891 --> 07:06.193
But Malcolm has a right
to know that you're back
with Stan!

07:06.226 --> 07:09.029
Oh, yeah? Well, we had
a big fight and I had
to break up with him.

07:09.062 --> 07:11.932
He was devastated,
but...

07:11.965 --> 07:15.002
I think we left it
in a good place.

07:15.035 --> 07:18.606
Jump out
of all the moving taxis
you want to, Karen.

07:18.639 --> 07:21.575
The argument isn't over
'til I say it's over.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.944
Why did you break up
with me,

07:23.977 --> 07:25.012
and just before
the Autumn Carnival?

07:27.280 --> 07:28.949
Do you see?

07:28.982 --> 07:31.118
This is exactly the kind
of confrontation

07:31.151 --> 07:34.054
I was trying to avoid
when I threw myself
onto Eighth Avenue!

07:36.123 --> 07:37.991
Malcolm, can't you
just go by yourself?

07:38.025 --> 07:40.494
Ugh. I can't go
to the Carnival
without a woman.

07:40.528 --> 07:43.897
The gays would be
all over a bear like me.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.870
Besides, it's pathetic
going alone.

07:49.903 --> 07:52.205
- I'm going alone.
- Aren't you aggressive?

07:52.239 --> 07:54.942
I'd love to go with you.
Pick me up at 8:00 o'clock.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.610
And if I'm still getting ready,
have a drink with my housemates.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.514
Okay, that's crazy.

08:02.716 --> 08:06.587
What? A government agent
can't live with two waitresses
and a law student?

08:08.188 --> 08:10.724
Karen, I don't wanna go
with Malcolm.

08:10.758 --> 08:14.127
Oh, come on, honey, please!
You owe it to him!

08:14.161 --> 08:16.530
And besides,
it would mean so much.

08:16.564 --> 08:17.998
Malcolm lives
for a good carnival.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.067
The whole gang knows that!

08:22.202 --> 08:24.237
What gang?

08:24.271 --> 08:26.907
You, me, Will, Jack,

08:26.940 --> 08:28.942
Kenickie, Frenchy, Putzy--
the gang!

08:34.147 --> 08:35.215
KAREN:
Hey, Will-ma.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.050
- Nice Autumn Carnival.
- Oh.

08:37.084 --> 08:39.553
This is a wonderful thing
you're doing for charity.

08:39.587 --> 08:41.955
Yeah, whatever,
I'm just hopin' to get
a boyfriend out of this.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.761
Hello, Miss Karen.

08:47.795 --> 08:51.599
Well, if it isn't
the bearded lady herself.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.702
Don't I need a ticket

08:54.735 --> 08:57.971
to gape at you
in awe and repulsion?

08:58.005 --> 09:00.941
I wouldn't talk, lady.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.977
I'm the person
who used to pluck
your chin hairs.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.982
If it weren't for me,
you'd look like ZZ Top.

09:12.085 --> 09:15.789
I wouldn't stand so close
to the carnival games
if I were you.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.691
Someone might take you home,

09:17.725 --> 09:19.660
thinking they won
a giant Shrek doll.

09:23.096 --> 09:26.199
So, this is my first big event
as a public figure,

09:26.233 --> 09:28.168
and I'm not quite sure
how to act.

09:28.201 --> 09:30.638
Like, how do I treat people?

09:30.671 --> 09:32.172
How do I pose for pictures?

09:32.205 --> 09:34.107
How do I feel
about the war in Azkaban?

09:36.710 --> 09:39.346
Just remember, we're better
than everyone else. Okay?

09:39.379 --> 09:41.114
And for flip's sake,
I'm Baby frickin' Glenn,

09:41.148 --> 09:43.717
and you're
Jack frickin' Garland.

09:43.751 --> 09:46.319
Uh, it's McFarland.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.656
Yeah,
you're Jack Farland.

09:48.689 --> 09:51.091
It's McFarland.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.761
Jeez, what, do you still
have dirt in your ears?

09:57.330 --> 09:58.732
Ah, guys.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.000
- Oh, what...
- I--what--uh...

10:00.033 --> 10:01.334
Excuse me, uh,

10:01.368 --> 10:03.671
what the hell do you think
you're doin' in here?

10:05.305 --> 10:08.742
This is a storage room
for beverages.

10:08.776 --> 10:11.679
Uh, maybe in your fantasy.

10:11.712 --> 10:14.281
But this is our dressing room.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.717
And quite frankly,
we're not happy about it.

10:16.750 --> 10:21.121
Yeah, I know,
I got your list of demands.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.189
"A chocolate fountain.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.192
"A pony.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.696
"And to live forever".

10:31.398 --> 10:35.168
Now, this place
needs to be a room of refuge.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.104
You know,
for when we're on break.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.772
- What break?
- From performing.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.741
- You're not performing.
- I know, we're on break.

10:46.479 --> 10:50.217
Guys, all you have to do
is stand on stage

10:50.250 --> 10:52.886
while unsuspecting people
bid on you. Okay?

10:52.920 --> 10:54.454
Now I gotta start
this auction.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.823
Where's the microphone?
I left it right here.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.090
Yeah, I took it.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.828
I thought it was part
of my gift bag.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.332
There are no gift bags!
Okay?

11:05.365 --> 11:07.400
You each get one can
of Fanta, that's it!

11:07.434 --> 11:09.737
Okay.

11:09.770 --> 11:13.073
This is ridiculous.
We cannot have this kind
of stress before we go on.

11:13.106 --> 11:16.476
- JACK: Yeah.
- You are not "going on"!

11:16.509 --> 11:20.714
Neither one of you
is a celebrity. Okay?

11:20.748 --> 11:23.216
Baby Glenn, I mean,
you weren't even a baby
when you fell in that hole,

11:23.250 --> 11:25.218
you were twelve years old!

11:25.252 --> 11:27.254
They just called you a baby

11:27.287 --> 11:29.923
because you cried
for three straight days!

11:29.957 --> 11:32.793
Well...
( chuckles )

11:32.826 --> 11:35.863
somebody's jealous
they didn't get stuck
in a hole,

11:35.896 --> 11:37.230
That's what I got
from that. Ah.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.273
How dare you...

11:48.275 --> 11:51.278
talk to my boyfriend
like that.

11:51.311 --> 11:55.182
You're lucky we even showed up
to your piece-of-crap event!

11:55.215 --> 11:59.753
Do you know that man opened
over twenty grocery stores?

11:59.787 --> 12:01.922
You respect him!

12:06.927 --> 12:09.496
Well, you're right,
you know, when you hear,
"Baby Glenn,"

12:09.529 --> 12:11.264
you do think,
"Hey, I've heard of him".

12:11.298 --> 12:14.868
But Jack, you host
a local gay talk show.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.871
Whose time slot
is between nine hours
of The Golden Girls

12:17.905 --> 12:20.373
and six queens
standing in front
of a rainbow flag

12:20.407 --> 12:22.209
singing,
"Oh, Gays Can You See?"

12:26.379 --> 12:29.482
You are a jealous,
bitter queen.

12:31.451 --> 12:34.354
You can't stand
that I am somebody
and you are nobody.

12:34.387 --> 12:36.456
I shouldn't even
be having this conversation!

12:36.489 --> 12:39.827
It is beneath my dignity!

12:41.428 --> 12:42.796
Now, if you'll excuse me,

12:42.830 --> 12:44.898
I'm gonna take
my free "fan of Canta,"

12:47.334 --> 12:49.236
and go clean the llama poop
off my shoe.

12:54.942 --> 12:58.378
( Grace gasps )
Cotton candy! Ha ha!

12:58.411 --> 13:00.914
Once at a fair
in junior high,

13:00.948 --> 13:03.917
this kid dared me to eat,
like, ten sticks of this stuff.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.486
I got pretty far,
and then, bleh,

13:06.519 --> 13:09.122
all over my face
and my clothes.

13:09.156 --> 13:12.425
And, oh, then I had
my first kiss.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.997
You are a real charmer,
Grace Adler.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.267
Thank you for coming
on this date with me.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.368
Sure, it's my pleasure.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.406
Hold my pocket.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.342
What?

13:29.376 --> 13:31.945
I like
when my girls do that.

13:34.047 --> 13:37.017
No! I'm not gonna hold
your pocket!

13:37.050 --> 13:38.919
You're my girl,
you hold my pocket.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.022
And now for one
of our featured items--

13:42.055 --> 13:43.390
a dinner
with everyone's favorite

13:43.423 --> 13:46.059
clumsy, lovable pre-teen
from the Eighties.

13:46.093 --> 13:47.294
You loved him
in the hole,

13:47.327 --> 13:49.296
you'll love him
at Bagel Nosh.

13:49.329 --> 13:49.930
Baby Glenn!

13:53.333 --> 13:56.036
"Help, help,
I'm in a hole!"

14:00.407 --> 14:03.343
They know the underpants
stay on, right?

14:03.376 --> 14:05.312
- What shall we start
the bidding at?
- A thousand.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.014
I don't think
you're gonna go
for a thousand.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.515
- A thousand!
- What? A thousand?

14:08.548 --> 14:11.284
- Eleven hundred.
- Eleven hundred?

14:11.318 --> 14:14.955
Wow, okay, uh,
going once, going twice,
sold for eleven hundred.

14:17.057 --> 14:19.526
Wow, that's even more
than we raised

14:19.559 --> 14:21.228
at the "Hands Across
My Hole" benefit.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.966
Karen,
I need to talk to you.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.100
Malcolm's a mess.

14:27.134 --> 14:28.301
He's made me
his girlfriend,

14:28.335 --> 14:30.503
he wants me
to hold his pocket.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.573
You've gotta fix this,
go talk to him.

14:33.606 --> 14:36.143
And hurt him again?
Honey, I can't!

14:36.176 --> 14:39.012
Oh, Karen,
you are the same woman

14:39.046 --> 14:41.014
who blindfolded Rosie,
gave her a stick,

14:41.048 --> 14:42.215
and told her a beehive
was a piñata.

14:49.289 --> 14:52.525
Some good came from that.
We learned she was allergic.

14:54.061 --> 14:58.065
All right! I'll do it.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.233
Ah, ladies and gentlemen,
next you'll be bidding on dinner

15:00.267 --> 15:03.470
with the host
of Out TV's critically...

15:03.503 --> 15:06.173
acknowledged show,
Jack Talk--

15:06.206 --> 15:08.541
Jack McFarland!

15:10.110 --> 15:12.445
When you see
how famous I am,

15:12.479 --> 15:16.183
you will Rue McClanahan
the day you doubted me.

15:19.119 --> 15:20.320
You got a booger.

15:20.353 --> 15:24.091
I'm gonna start
the bidding at $100.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.225
Anybody?
One hundred dollars.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.296
They know the underpants
come off, right?

15:32.032 --> 15:35.468
Folks? Dinner
with Jack McFarland, $100?

15:35.502 --> 15:37.304
The meal itself
is worth 200,

15:37.337 --> 15:39.472
so you're--you're gonna
come out okay on this one.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.178
You'll be helping
needy people.

15:50.383 --> 15:54.287
Forget it, Will,
you were right,
nobody knows who I am.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.289
Wait, wait, wait, oh,
I have an opening bid of $100.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.158
One hundred dollars here.
Oh! Two hundred.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.226
Two hundred,
do I hear two-fifty?

15:59.259 --> 16:00.427
Five hundred dollars?

16:00.460 --> 16:02.095
Jack,
did you hear that gasp?

16:02.129 --> 16:04.097
No, I did not.

16:04.131 --> 16:06.599
I have five hundred--Six!

16:06.633 --> 16:09.602
Seven! Eight! Nine!

16:09.636 --> 16:12.172
I have a thousand dollars!

16:12.205 --> 16:14.074
Eleven hundred!
Twelve hundred! Thirteen!

16:14.107 --> 16:16.309
Fourteen!
Fifteen hundred dollars!

16:16.343 --> 16:19.679
Sold! For fifteen hundred
dollars, thank you sir!

16:22.215 --> 16:25.418
Oh, my God, auctions
are so exciting,

16:25.452 --> 16:28.388
the hands went up so fast
I didn't see 'em!

16:28.421 --> 16:31.191
Did you talk to Malcolm?
How'd it go?

16:31.224 --> 16:33.193
Perfect.
We're getting back together.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.628
He's taking me to Cancun
for a week.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.131
Maybe I'll take some jeans
and trade him for a new maid.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.668
Karen, I know
you don't wanna hurt him,

16:41.701 --> 16:43.370
but you're hurting him more
by lying to him.

16:43.403 --> 16:44.504
Here he comes!

16:44.537 --> 16:46.139
- Break up with him.
- I'm scared!

16:46.173 --> 16:47.240
I'll be right here
no matter what.

16:47.274 --> 16:48.308
( sighs )
Thanks.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.209
- Oh, funnel cake.
- Ah!

16:51.611 --> 16:53.113
GRACE: Two-fifty?

16:54.614 --> 16:56.483
MALCOM: Hey, baby,
look what I won you.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.550
- Isn't it cute?
- Oh!

16:57.584 --> 16:59.519
You can put it
next to the bed,

16:59.552 --> 17:01.354
and stuff a camera
inside of it,

17:01.388 --> 17:04.191
it'll record us
while we're doin' it.

17:06.326 --> 17:08.461
Malcolm,
you're making it hard.

17:08.495 --> 17:09.662
Well, let's wait 'til
the camera's inside the bear.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.504
It's--it's just that...

17:17.537 --> 17:19.206
- ( phone rings )
- KAREN: Oh.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.507
- Excuse me,
I have to take this.
- Okay.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.541
This is Rene.

17:24.311 --> 17:25.412
That's my real name,
I'll explain it later.

17:25.445 --> 17:28.281
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

17:28.315 --> 17:30.650
Was it code red
or code green?

17:30.683 --> 17:33.186
How am I supposed to know
what to wear?

17:33.220 --> 17:35.255
Well,
what are you wearing?

17:35.288 --> 17:36.055
Oh, great, we're gonna
look like twins.

17:36.089 --> 17:38.358
Okay,
let's review the mission.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.693
Sri Lanka,
eleven hundred hours,
Singapore Airlines.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.562
I call the window seat,
I called it first,
goodbye.

17:47.767 --> 17:51.271
I'm sorry,
but I have to go to,
um, New Hampshire.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.407
For jury duty.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.345
I'm gonna be gone
for six to eighteen months.

17:58.378 --> 18:03.283
Wait a minute!
You're from New Hampshire?

18:04.451 --> 18:05.618
I'm sorry, Karen,

18:05.652 --> 18:07.354
I know it's not fair
to ask you to wait,

18:07.387 --> 18:08.355
so I'm gonna have
to break up with you.

18:10.357 --> 18:13.260
Goodbye, baby.

18:17.464 --> 18:18.431
Malcolm?

18:18.465 --> 18:20.300
Yes?

18:20.333 --> 18:22.802
Sailboats and sunsets?

18:22.835 --> 18:25.405
Sailboats and sunsets, baby.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.577
GRACE: So romantic.

18:32.379 --> 18:33.246
What did that mean?

18:35.348 --> 18:39.186
It's...too complicated
to explain.

18:39.219 --> 18:42.355
He nailed me on a windjammer
at 6:17 P.M.

18:53.766 --> 18:55.268
That was complicated.

18:58.471 --> 19:01.374
Thanks for taking the time
to explain it.

19:03.576 --> 19:07.580
You know, Grace, I know
I did the right thing, but...

19:07.614 --> 19:09.349
I'm sad to see him go.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.520
You know what always
makes me feel better?

19:13.553 --> 19:14.654
What's that?

19:16.589 --> 19:17.557
Funnel cake.

19:19.426 --> 19:22.395
Honey, can I have some?

19:22.429 --> 19:23.463
Yeah, the stand's
right over there.

19:30.970 --> 19:33.506
WILL: There's
the 1,500-dollar man!

19:33.540 --> 19:35.942
Pretty great, right?

19:35.975 --> 19:39.346
I know no one
was bidding on me, Will.

19:39.379 --> 19:42.915
Just when
I thought I was famous,
it got ripped away.

19:42.949 --> 19:45.818
I feel like Teri Hatcher
six years ago.

19:52.259 --> 19:54.627
And Teri Hatcher
six years from now.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.367
You're wrong, Jack,

20:00.400 --> 20:02.302
somebody did bid on you,
I have his check right here.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.003
Who?

20:04.036 --> 20:05.305
Me.

20:08.441 --> 20:09.609
( chuckles )

20:09.642 --> 20:11.544
You have Care Bears
on your checks!

20:16.683 --> 20:20.019
I thought
they were polar bears
when I ordered them.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.589
I don't get it,
why would you bid on me?

20:22.622 --> 20:26.293
Because years from now,
I wanna be able to say,

20:26.326 --> 20:27.894
"I knew him when."

20:27.927 --> 20:29.429
Now look
what you've done, Jack,

20:29.462 --> 20:31.531
you--you went
from Just Jack,

20:31.564 --> 20:32.899
to Jack Two Thousand One,

20:32.932 --> 20:34.301
to Jack Two Thousand Two,

20:34.334 --> 20:35.902
to Jack Talk.

20:35.935 --> 20:38.871
I mean, your hands
have never been out of work!

20:40.907 --> 20:42.575
Maybe I have done okay.

20:42.609 --> 20:46.012
Okay? You're on your way!

20:46.045 --> 20:48.281
You're--you're passionate,
you're driven,

20:48.315 --> 20:49.982
you work hard...

20:50.016 --> 20:52.285
I know it's gonna happen
for ya.

20:52.319 --> 20:54.321
Thank you, Will.
I love you.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.622
I love you, too.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.561
So that's why you
bought the dinner?

21:01.594 --> 21:02.629
You are unbelievable.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.433
Do not watch my ass
as I leave.
