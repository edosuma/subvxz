00:59.491 --> 01:00.959
Hi, Louie.

01:00.993 --> 01:02.193
I'm back.

01:02.228 --> 01:03.094
Back from what?

01:03.129 --> 01:04.194
I took a week off

01:04.313 --> 01:05.780
to study for my finals.

01:05.815 --> 01:08.149
You didn't even notice
         I wasn't here?

01:08.184 --> 01:09.533
I don't even notice you now.

01:14.590 --> 01:16.891
Thanks.
     It's nice to be back.

01:16.925 --> 01:17.975
Hi, everybody.

01:18.010 --> 01:19.544
I'm back from
                   my finals.

01:19.578 --> 01:21.112
What finals?

01:21.146 --> 01:22.697
Do I have the right garage?

01:22.732 --> 01:23.832
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:23.866 --> 01:25.333
Your finals, right.
Oh, yeah!

01:25.367 --> 01:27.635
Sorry, John, we've just had
  other things on our minds.

01:27.670 --> 01:29.604
Yeah. These guys from Hollywood
are coming here today.

01:29.638 --> 01:31.473
They're going to make
this big movie on cab drivers.

01:31.507 --> 01:33.575
They're going to do research
right here in the garage.

01:33.609 --> 01:35.927
Wow!
         Who's coming?

01:35.961 --> 01:37.729
Well, you know Roger Chapman,
that big director?

01:37.763 --> 01:39.697
Yeah.
He's coming, and Michael
Patrese, the star.

01:39.732 --> 01:41.533
He's starred in that flick.
He's coming, too.

01:41.567 --> 01:43.501
Michael Patrese,
                now he's a good
                actor, isn't he?

01:43.536 --> 01:45.269
Yeah. He's got a lot
of potential.

01:45.304 --> 01:48.272
You know, if he really applies
himself and concentrates,

01:48.307 --> 01:50.775
one day he could be as big
as Brando, Pacino...

01:50.810 --> 01:53.277
me, you know.

01:53.312 --> 01:56.514
Bob, maybe there's a part
     in this movie for you.

01:56.548 --> 01:58.950
Gee, why didn't
        I think of that?

01:58.984 --> 02:00.318
( <i>mutters</i> )

02:00.353 --> 02:01.536
Hi.

02:01.571 --> 02:02.937
Hi, Alex.

02:02.971 --> 02:04.005
ALEX:
                      Hey, John!

02:04.039 --> 02:05.640
How did your
                    finals go?

02:05.675 --> 02:06.774
What finals?

02:06.809 --> 02:08.042
Isn't it incredible?

02:08.077 --> 02:10.044
Some movie people
from Hollywood

02:10.079 --> 02:11.913
are coming
to the garage.

02:11.947 --> 02:13.715
Oh, is that today?

02:13.749 --> 02:15.015
Alex, aren't you excited?

02:15.050 --> 02:17.017
Sure. So, how did
        your finals go?

02:17.052 --> 02:19.019
What was it? Multiple choice?
      Essays? What was it?

02:19.054 --> 02:20.438
Essay. Excuse me, Alex.

02:20.472 --> 02:23.642
How come you're more interested
     in my life than I am?

02:23.676 --> 02:24.709
ELAINE:
Yeah.
                        Huh?

02:24.744 --> 02:25.961
JEFF:
Hey, somebody

02:25.995 --> 02:28.329
just pulled up in a limousine.

02:28.363 --> 02:29.848
( <i>excited shouting</i> )

02:29.882 --> 02:31.716
This is ridiculous.

02:31.751 --> 02:33.284
We look like a
              bunch of groupies.

02:33.318 --> 02:35.120
Don't hang around
            the door. Come on.

02:35.154 --> 02:37.188
Well, what do you want
          us to do, Bobby?

02:37.222 --> 02:38.857
I don't know.
Do what you normally do.

02:38.891 --> 02:40.725
Act natural, act...
Play cards or something.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.426
Make believe...
    Oh, come on, come on...

02:51.971 --> 02:53.204
Yeah.

02:54.239 --> 02:56.207
See what I mean?

02:56.241 --> 02:58.326
This is why
      we came to New York.

02:58.360 --> 03:01.429
You can't stage
     this kind of reality.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.464
Excuse me.

03:03.498 --> 03:06.867
I'm looking for
a Mr. Louie De Palma.

03:06.902 --> 03:08.202
That's me.

03:08.237 --> 03:09.603
Hi. I'm Roger Chapman.

03:09.638 --> 03:11.772
I spoke to your boss,
Mr. McKenzie.

03:11.807 --> 03:13.141
Right, right.
How are you, sir?

03:13.175 --> 03:17.178
Listen, if there's
            anything I can do to
            make your visit here

03:17.212 --> 03:20.315
more pleasant
            or productive,
            just say the word.

03:20.349 --> 03:23.634
Okay. Boy, this place
is thick with atmosphere.

03:23.668 --> 03:27.705
Yeah, well, sometimes
        the ventilation's bad.

03:27.739 --> 03:29.440
Where do you
                  want to start?

03:29.474 --> 03:32.810
Well, I'd like to say
a few words to the drivers.

03:32.844 --> 03:34.979
Oh. I think it would be good
   if I talked to them first.

03:35.013 --> 03:36.248
Uh-huh.

03:36.282 --> 03:37.982
See, I used to be
           a driver,

03:38.016 --> 03:40.518
and I have a special
       rapport with them.

03:40.553 --> 03:41.653
Okay.
        All right?

03:41.687 --> 03:46.124
Okay, clowns,
            listen up here.

03:46.158 --> 03:47.458
And shut your mouths.

03:47.492 --> 03:50.261
This man has
                something to
                say to you.

03:54.916 --> 03:57.619
Was that... satisfactory?

03:59.355 --> 04:01.289
You bet. Thank you.

04:01.323 --> 04:03.107
Gather in here.

04:03.142 --> 04:04.376
All right.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.943
My name is Roger Chapman.

04:05.978 --> 04:07.345
Hi. Yeah, we know.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.180
This is my assistant, Lea,
    and my aide, Richard.

04:09.214 --> 04:10.582
Hey, Richard.
            Now, I just want

04:10.616 --> 04:13.050
to kind of let you people know
     where I'm coming from.

04:13.085 --> 04:15.536
We're gonna make a movie
       about cab drivers,

04:15.571 --> 04:18.339
and the reason
                we're here is we
                want reality.

04:18.374 --> 04:20.173
Not Hollywood reality.

04:20.209 --> 04:22.076
We want <i>real</i> reality.

04:22.110 --> 04:23.912
So, we want to...

04:23.946 --> 04:25.496
we want to... live
         with you guys.

04:25.531 --> 04:28.599
We want to eat with you
       and talk with you

04:28.634 --> 04:31.201
and-and get inside your heads.

04:31.236 --> 04:34.472
You know, why don't you forget
     we're from Hollywood,

04:34.506 --> 04:36.774
and forget we're
      even making a movie.

04:36.809 --> 04:38.342
We're just some people

04:38.376 --> 04:42.697
who-who would like to find out
 what it's like to drive a cab.

04:42.732 --> 04:44.566
Now, anybody
      have any questions?

04:44.600 --> 04:46.267
Okay, you.

04:46.302 --> 04:49.237
How'd they part the Red Sea
in <i>The Ten Commandments?</i>

04:49.271 --> 04:51.272
Uh, he-he's only
        clowning around.

04:51.307 --> 04:52.873
What's wrong with you?

04:52.908 --> 04:56.077
Hey, listen, have you
           all had breakfast?

04:56.111 --> 04:56.811
No.
                            No.

04:56.846 --> 04:57.962
'Cause I was
            just thinking

04:57.996 --> 04:59.530
of ordering something
         for all of us.

04:59.565 --> 05:00.531
What do you guys want?

05:00.566 --> 05:01.833
No.
            Oh...

05:01.867 --> 05:03.935
No, come on.
Hey, every morning we are here,

05:03.969 --> 05:06.704
I'm going to bring in
   whatever you guys ask for.

05:06.738 --> 05:08.238
So, what will it be?

05:08.273 --> 05:10.458
Well, I'll have some coffee.

05:10.492 --> 05:12.460
Yeah, and some doughnuts.

05:12.494 --> 05:15.179
You can have anything.
        Anything at all.

05:15.214 --> 05:16.948
Jelly doughnuts?

05:18.250 --> 05:19.484
Gotcha.

05:19.518 --> 05:20.718
Oh!

05:20.752 --> 05:22.002
RICHARD:
                   Hey, Michael!

05:22.037 --> 05:24.372
ROGER:
            Michael, Michael,
            you're here.

05:24.406 --> 05:25.473
How you doing?
Sorry I'm late.

05:25.507 --> 05:27.142
( <i>indistinct voices</i> )

05:27.176 --> 05:29.944
That's all right.
         I just got here myself.

05:29.979 --> 05:31.579
Everybody...

05:31.613 --> 05:33.181
this is
                Michael Patrese.

05:33.215 --> 05:34.215
Hi.
               Hi.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.549
Hey, Tony Banta.

05:35.584 --> 05:36.818
How you doing?

05:36.852 --> 05:39.154
Hey. Hey, uh, Bobby here
   wants to be an actor, too.

05:39.188 --> 05:41.455
Oh, Tony...
    Come on! You know you
    want to be an actor.

05:41.490 --> 05:42.456
Aw, Tony!
    Come on!

05:42.491 --> 05:43.591
Michael Patrese.

05:43.625 --> 05:46.527
Hi. Can you get me a part
        in the picture?

05:48.296 --> 05:50.364
I think we'd better
    get started right away.

05:50.398 --> 05:52.767
Uh, let me tell you
      what we have so far.

05:52.801 --> 05:56.137
We have a script...

05:56.172 --> 05:59.407
but it's not
a particularly good one.

05:59.441 --> 06:02.410
It just doesn't have
any, um...

06:02.445 --> 06:04.245
guts.

06:05.330 --> 06:07.565
It's the story of a...

06:07.599 --> 06:11.002
it's the story
     of a cabby named Joe.

06:11.036 --> 06:12.904
He's a good driver.

06:12.938 --> 06:15.640
He's been at it
     for some time, and...

06:15.674 --> 06:17.391
And that's all we have.

06:17.425 --> 06:21.963
The rest of it's going to have
    to come from you people.

06:21.997 --> 06:23.965
We want to hear
      all of your stories,

06:23.999 --> 06:27.234
and maybe one of your stories
        is Joe's story.

06:27.268 --> 06:28.335
BOBBY:
Hey, you know,

06:28.370 --> 06:29.770
the guy you really
ought to talk to

06:29.805 --> 06:30.922
is Alex Rieger.

06:30.956 --> 06:31.956
He's got the best stories.

06:31.991 --> 06:33.124
Okay, which one
                 of you is Alex?

06:33.158 --> 06:34.392
Uh...
He's over
there.

06:34.426 --> 06:36.961
Okay. Thank you.

06:36.995 --> 06:38.396
Alex?

06:38.430 --> 06:40.231
Hi. Roger Chapman.

06:40.266 --> 06:41.599
Hi. Alex Rieger.

06:41.634 --> 06:43.767
Great. Listen, can we talk
for a few moments?

06:43.802 --> 06:47.538
Uh, listen, I, uh...

06:47.573 --> 06:49.240
I mean, I don't know you.

06:49.274 --> 06:51.842
You're probably a very
          decent guy, but...

06:51.876 --> 06:53.728
You're right.
You don't know me.

06:53.762 --> 06:55.029
( <i>chuckles</i> )

06:57.148 --> 06:59.050
( <i>forced chuckles</i> )

07:00.719 --> 07:02.687
This is some kind
               of joke, right?

07:02.721 --> 07:04.021
Yeah. Little one.

07:04.056 --> 07:06.123
Listen, I, uh...

07:06.157 --> 07:08.059
I'm, uh...

07:08.093 --> 07:09.694
I just wish you, uh...

07:09.728 --> 07:11.862
you wouldn't count
            me into this, huh?

07:11.897 --> 07:14.182
Hey, hey, Alex, all he wants to
do is ask you a few questions.

07:14.216 --> 07:15.600
Yeah.
                Yeah. Well, I
                just don't feel

07:15.634 --> 07:17.302
like answering any questions.

07:17.336 --> 07:18.670
Look, I'm a cabby.
You want me

07:18.704 --> 07:20.938
to take you someplace,
I'll take you someplace.

07:20.972 --> 07:23.041
There's a reason you call
   your private life private,

07:23.075 --> 07:25.476
and if I was to talk about it
  with somebody I don't know,

07:25.510 --> 07:27.278
well, it just wouldn't be
        private anymore.

07:27.313 --> 07:29.213
So, uh... I'm sorry.
      Excuse me, will you?

07:29.248 --> 07:31.966
I'll see you all
tomorrow.

07:34.436 --> 07:36.470
That's our Joe.

07:43.979 --> 07:45.613
Well, uh, thanks
                for breakfast.

07:45.647 --> 07:46.914
Oh, my pleasure.
Listen, I hope

07:46.949 --> 07:48.916
you don't mind
my picking your brain that way.

07:48.951 --> 07:52.186
Some of those stories
were just great.

07:52.221 --> 07:55.556
Thanks. Some of them
            even happened.

07:55.591 --> 07:57.875
You know what?
Has anyone ever told you

07:57.909 --> 08:01.145
you... look a little
like a young Lana Turner?

08:01.179 --> 08:02.579
No.

08:02.614 --> 08:04.448
'Cause you don't.

08:06.384 --> 08:07.952
But you know what?

08:07.986 --> 08:09.286
You're very pretty.

08:09.320 --> 08:10.487
Thanks.

08:10.522 --> 08:13.423
And I had a wonderful,
wonderful morning.

08:13.458 --> 08:16.444
This guy's got the
              fastest left hook
              you've ever seen.

08:16.478 --> 08:17.511
That's right, yeah.

08:17.546 --> 08:19.314
Tony, you're a boxer,
          aren't you?

08:19.348 --> 08:21.049
Yeah. We were just
              talking about

08:21.083 --> 08:23.551
next week's title fight,
        next Thursday night.

08:23.585 --> 08:24.585
You got tickets?

08:24.619 --> 08:26.487
Yeah. Sure.

08:26.521 --> 08:28.322
Lea?

08:28.356 --> 08:31.175
Get Tony a seat
 for that fight Thursday night.

08:31.210 --> 08:32.677
Okay.
            Ringside.

08:32.711 --> 08:35.246
Gee, thanks! Bobby, I'm
       going to go to the fight.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.515
That's great!
        Oh... you need
        two tickets.

08:37.549 --> 08:38.916
You've got a girlfriend.

08:38.950 --> 08:40.618
Well, not right now.

08:40.652 --> 08:43.904
Well, Lea here is kind of
    a boxing fan, you know.

08:43.938 --> 08:45.339
Would you mind
                taking her?

08:45.373 --> 08:46.607
I guess I could.

08:46.642 --> 08:48.242
Oh, he doesn't have to.

08:48.276 --> 08:51.412
No, that's the kind of guy I am.

08:51.446 --> 08:53.297
Okay.

08:53.332 --> 08:56.700
I'll go make the arrangements.

08:56.735 --> 08:57.902
You lucky stiff.

08:57.937 --> 08:59.771
Well...

08:59.805 --> 09:01.422
I'm going to sit
 in the first row of the fight,

09:01.456 --> 09:02.823
and I'm not even going
         to have to get

09:02.857 --> 09:04.492
knocked out of the ring
         to get there.

09:04.526 --> 09:06.077
Hope it's
       a good one, Tony.

09:06.111 --> 09:07.178
Thanks. Oh!

09:07.212 --> 09:08.412
MAN:
Excuse me,
Mr. Chapman?

09:08.446 --> 09:09.446
Yeah.
Food's here.

09:09.481 --> 09:10.748
Food.

09:10.782 --> 09:12.783
I had the
            eggs Benedict.

09:14.786 --> 09:16.087
JOHN:
                    Mr. Chapman?

09:16.121 --> 09:17.088
Yeah?

09:17.122 --> 09:18.455
Excuse me,
                    Mr. Chapman?

09:18.490 --> 09:20.124
Listen, I think
                 I might have

09:20.158 --> 09:22.276
a very interesting
              thing for you.

09:22.310 --> 09:23.945
Well, go ahead,
John, shoot.

09:23.979 --> 09:26.014
Okay, well, about
               four months ago,

09:26.048 --> 09:30.018
this guy jumped into
       my cab and he says,
       "Take me to 54th Street."

09:30.052 --> 09:31.786
When we get
            there, he says...

09:31.820 --> 09:32.787
( <i>laughs</i> )

09:32.821 --> 09:35.523
He says...
                      he says...

09:35.557 --> 09:36.958
He says, "My God!

09:36.992 --> 09:39.027
They've torn
             the building down."

09:39.061 --> 09:40.394
( <i>laughs</i> )

09:40.428 --> 09:44.465
It turns out instead of
      taking him to 54th Street,

09:44.499 --> 09:46.634
I'd taken him
                to <i>53rd</i> Street.

09:46.669 --> 09:49.804
Huh? When we found
            out, you know, we
            were both so amused,

09:49.838 --> 09:52.140
we just sat there
            and laughed.

09:53.776 --> 09:55.176
It was...

09:55.210 --> 09:57.311
As any of us would, John.

09:59.715 --> 10:03.084
Tell me, do you, uh...
do you have a lot
of stories like this?

10:03.118 --> 10:05.470
Well, they're not
            all as good as
            that one, but, uh...

10:05.504 --> 10:06.870
Yeah, I could
                 tell you a few.

10:06.905 --> 10:09.140
One time, this
                girl came in...

10:09.174 --> 10:12.009
You know, John,
John, John, John...
I have a better idea.

10:12.043 --> 10:15.546
Why don't you write them
all down as they occur to you,

10:15.581 --> 10:18.149
then scoop them up
in a big pile.

10:18.183 --> 10:19.883
Then bring them to me,

10:19.918 --> 10:24.322
and I'll see that they get
just the treatment they deserve.

10:24.356 --> 10:25.623
And fast.

10:25.657 --> 10:27.325
Oh, great. Thanks.

10:27.359 --> 10:29.227
I'll go get started.

10:29.261 --> 10:30.728
You do that.
                        Thanks.

10:30.762 --> 10:32.446
( <i>chuckles</i> )

10:32.480 --> 10:34.849
Excuse me, Mr. De Palma.

10:34.883 --> 10:36.117
Uh-huh?

10:40.555 --> 10:43.590
Listen, there's, uh,
something I'd like to ask you.

10:43.625 --> 10:44.959
Shoot.

10:47.546 --> 10:50.347
Well, we've heard that
certain dispatchers

10:50.382 --> 10:52.850
will take advantage
of their position

10:52.885 --> 10:54.351
by... taking bribes

10:54.386 --> 10:56.353
you know, shaking down drivers,
that sort of thing.

10:56.388 --> 10:58.723
Is there any truth
in that?

10:58.757 --> 11:02.910
What's it worth
            to you to find out?

11:06.848 --> 11:09.317
I think you just
answered my question.

11:09.351 --> 11:10.617
Thank you.

11:11.419 --> 11:13.171
( <i>snarls</i> )

11:14.823 --> 11:19.076
Hey, Alex, you want
some pigs in a blanket?

11:19.110 --> 11:21.295
Oh, actually, I was
     on my way to Mario's.

11:21.329 --> 11:22.730
Anyone want to come?

11:22.764 --> 11:23.397
Are you kidding?

11:23.432 --> 11:25.433
The food at Mario's is terrible

11:25.467 --> 11:26.534
compared to this.

11:26.568 --> 11:28.736
They use horse meat
        for hamburgers.

11:28.770 --> 11:29.937
You're crazy.

11:29.971 --> 11:31.455
Take my word for it.

11:31.489 --> 11:32.723
Who are you?

11:32.758 --> 11:35.009
The cook at Mario's.

11:35.043 --> 11:37.111
Oh.

11:37.145 --> 11:39.346
You know, Alex,
                 I think I know

11:39.380 --> 11:41.849
how you feel about
              talking to me,

11:41.883 --> 11:44.819
and I... I want
             to tell you I
             respect you for it.

11:44.853 --> 11:46.654
But you know, I got
             a hunch about you.

11:46.688 --> 11:49.690
I think that you can
       really help this picture,

11:49.725 --> 11:52.126
and I'm not going
              to leave you alone

11:52.160 --> 11:54.161
until I get what
               I want, you know?

11:54.195 --> 11:56.230
I didn't get where
              I... where I am

11:56.264 --> 11:59.366
in this business today
     by taking no for an answer.

12:01.269 --> 12:03.871
Or by taking no answer
         for an answer.

12:03.905 --> 12:06.007
Look, Alex, you hang out here

12:06.041 --> 12:08.909
and I'm going to be
        around you every minute.

12:08.944 --> 12:10.778
You'd just
        better face it.

12:10.812 --> 12:12.730
I'm going to bug you like crazy
until I get what I want.

12:12.765 --> 12:14.098
Hey, look, I don't
       have to take this.

12:14.133 --> 12:15.800
You know, we got a union
        here, we got rules.

12:15.834 --> 12:17.969
Hey, Louie, Louie,
       where's the shop steward?

12:18.003 --> 12:19.553
<i>Where</i> is he?
           <i>Who</i> is he?

12:19.587 --> 12:21.305
I want to see
               the shop steward.

12:21.339 --> 12:22.990
Hey, you know,
  we're supposed to have one.

12:23.025 --> 12:24.959
It's a union rule that says
       one of the drivers

12:24.993 --> 12:27.461
is supposed to be the
 representative from the union.

12:27.495 --> 12:28.863
Yeah, come on.
                Anybody know
                who he is?

12:28.897 --> 12:30.764
Get him in here,
                because I got
                a grievance.

12:30.798 --> 12:32.632
All right, all right,
      keep your pants on.

12:32.667 --> 12:33.700
I'll look him up here.

12:38.673 --> 12:40.741
Um...

12:40.775 --> 12:43.444
Ben Goretski
      is the shop steward.

12:43.478 --> 12:45.379
Ben?

12:45.413 --> 12:47.982
Ben Goretski to the cage.

12:48.016 --> 12:49.132
I never heard of him.

12:49.167 --> 12:52.202
That's because he's been
      dead for two years.

12:52.237 --> 12:54.388
Never mind, Ben.

12:56.124 --> 12:59.026
Wow, looks like we're going to
    have to elect a new one.

12:59.060 --> 13:00.061
Oh, I nominate
                  Alex.

13:00.095 --> 13:01.395
Oh, come on, now,
            Elaine. Don't!

13:01.430 --> 13:02.496
Yeah, it's
    a good idea.

13:02.531 --> 13:04.065
All right.
       All those in favor

13:04.099 --> 13:06.500
of Alex being
our new shop steward say "aye."

13:06.535 --> 13:08.269
ALL:
              Aye!

13:08.303 --> 13:10.320
Wait a minute! Look, I don't
  want to be the shop steward.

13:10.355 --> 13:12.623
We can't force him into it.

13:12.657 --> 13:14.958
Well, why don't we just let
    Ben Goretski keep doing it?

13:14.993 --> 13:16.360
He's been doing a good job.

13:17.913 --> 13:20.948
All those in favor
    of keeping Ben Goretski

13:20.983 --> 13:23.217
as our shop steward say "aye."

13:23.252 --> 13:24.852
ALL:
              Aye!

13:24.887 --> 13:26.520
The ayes have it.

13:26.554 --> 13:27.755
Ben...

13:27.789 --> 13:31.558
if you can hear me,
        congratulations.

13:35.263 --> 13:38.865
Okay, what do you want to know?

13:41.036 --> 13:43.503
You know, this is
         the best pate

13:43.538 --> 13:45.205
we've had all week.

13:49.544 --> 13:51.178
Hi, Tony.
              How was the fight?

13:51.212 --> 13:52.179
Great, great.

13:52.213 --> 13:53.180
Yeah? Who won?

13:53.214 --> 13:55.249
I don't know.
Lea and I left early.

13:55.283 --> 13:57.751
Boy, I hope we get to fit in
another fight

13:57.785 --> 13:59.553
before you have
to leave town.

14:01.990 --> 14:04.058
Oh...

14:04.092 --> 14:05.759
Hi, everybody.
                    Hi, Alex.

14:05.794 --> 14:07.160
Hey, have you had
               breakfast yet?

14:07.195 --> 14:08.662
The sturgeon is
              really good today.

14:08.697 --> 14:10.230
I just had breakfast with Roger.
           You know,

14:10.264 --> 14:12.232
I told him things
 I haven't thought of in years.

14:12.266 --> 14:13.851
Yeah? Is he going to use
     some of your stories?

14:13.885 --> 14:15.720
Well, he said they were
       very interesting,

14:15.754 --> 14:18.356
but they weren't
  really right for the movie.

14:18.390 --> 14:20.624
He said they were
     more like television.

14:20.659 --> 14:22.943
You know,
  after all that fuss I made,

14:22.978 --> 14:25.579
I really have to admit it's
been... it's been a lot of fun.

14:25.613 --> 14:27.731
Boy!

14:27.766 --> 14:29.433
( <i>scoffs</i> )

14:29.467 --> 14:31.368
I can understand
      these other dummies

14:31.402 --> 14:33.704
being taken in
  by those Hollywood phonies,

14:33.738 --> 14:36.273
but I thought
you had more sense, Rieger.

14:36.307 --> 14:38.241
What are you
                talking about?

14:38.276 --> 14:40.861
Big Hollywood picture.

14:40.895 --> 14:43.330
Multimillion-dollar budget.

14:43.364 --> 14:45.933
They come in here,
      disrupt the garage,

14:45.967 --> 14:48.401
make all kinds
     of extra work for me,

14:48.436 --> 14:51.905
and don't even offer me
    a dime for my troubles.

14:53.292 --> 14:56.360
If I hadn't been selling
the leftovers to Mario's,

14:56.395 --> 14:58.896
this week would have been
a total loss.

14:59.898 --> 15:02.266
Good morning, Louie.
          How are you?

15:02.300 --> 15:05.002
( <i>mutters</i> )

15:05.036 --> 15:05.803
Roger.
    Hey, hi.

15:05.837 --> 15:06.920
Thanks for
       breakfast, really.

15:06.954 --> 15:08.188
My pleasure.
    Thank you.        Hi.

15:08.223 --> 15:10.457
Hi, Mr. Chapman.
I'm almost finished
with my stories.

15:10.492 --> 15:12.659
Great news, John.

15:12.693 --> 15:15.028
Listen, we're going to have to
 go back to Hollywood tomorrow.

15:15.063 --> 15:16.430
Yeah.
      But I just wanted
      to tell you

15:16.464 --> 15:18.299
that we're going to have
     a little get-together

15:18.333 --> 15:20.201
up at my suite at the Plaza
      tonight, about 8:15

15:20.235 --> 15:22.369
( <i>murmuring</i> )
        And we'd love
        to have all of you.

15:22.404 --> 15:23.520
Hey, we'll
                      be there.

15:23.555 --> 15:25.522
Don't worry
about it.
      ( <i>excited shouting</i> )

15:25.557 --> 15:28.208
Oh, also, the biggest news--
   Louie, come on down here.

15:28.243 --> 15:29.676
This concerns you, too.

15:29.710 --> 15:32.012
If your caterer
   is missing any silverware,

15:32.046 --> 15:33.847
I had nothing to do with it.

15:33.881 --> 15:36.350
No. I was talking to your boss,
         Mr. McKenzie,

15:36.385 --> 15:39.253
and I told him how we want
     to shoot this picture

15:39.287 --> 15:40.654
on location in New York.

15:40.689 --> 15:43.290
And I asked him
  if it was all right with him

15:43.324 --> 15:46.026
to shoot some of the scenes
    right here in the garage

15:46.060 --> 15:48.161
and use all the drivers
           as extras.

15:48.196 --> 15:50.197
( <i>excited chattering</i> )

15:50.231 --> 15:51.799
And Bobby...

15:51.833 --> 15:54.835
I think there's a part
in this film for you.

15:54.869 --> 15:56.937
( <i>all cheering</i> )

15:56.971 --> 15:58.422
Oh, wow!
    That's great!

15:58.456 --> 16:00.657
Wait, wait.
Did McKenzie agree?

16:00.692 --> 16:01.959
Yeah. He said it was fine
           with him.

16:01.993 --> 16:03.994
He said just as long
    as Louie didn't object.

16:28.703 --> 16:30.337
You mean...

16:30.371 --> 16:32.606
it's up to me
   whether you guys come back

16:32.641 --> 16:34.241
and shoot your picture here?

16:34.275 --> 16:35.208
Uh, yeah, Louie.

16:35.243 --> 16:36.927
Um, well, we'd be here
       for over a month,

16:36.962 --> 16:39.196
and he was worried
      that you might think

16:39.231 --> 16:40.697
it would be
    a little too disruptive

16:40.732 --> 16:41.798
for the garage.

16:41.833 --> 16:44.101
( <i>chuckles</i> )

16:46.487 --> 16:48.255
You mean...

16:48.289 --> 16:51.992
that it's <i>entirely</i> up to me.

16:52.026 --> 16:53.693
Well, uh, yes,
         Louie, it is.

16:53.728 --> 16:55.329
So, uh, so what do you say?

16:55.363 --> 16:58.898
You going to let us make a movie
   right here in your garage?

16:58.933 --> 17:01.451
Mr. Chapman...
      I ain't letting you

17:01.486 --> 17:03.888
take a snapshot in this garage.

17:03.922 --> 17:05.355
BOBBY:
                Hey, man, what's
                the matter?

17:05.390 --> 17:06.690
Why not, Louie?

17:06.724 --> 17:08.392
No. He's been
            in here all week

17:08.425 --> 17:10.260
disrupting the
            whole operation.

17:10.295 --> 17:12.061
I can't take
            a month of that.

17:12.096 --> 17:13.297
Oh, terrific.
         Thanks a lot.

17:13.330 --> 17:14.781
Well, you know, Louie, uh...

17:14.816 --> 17:17.483
we might try to make it
       worth your while.

17:27.846 --> 17:29.279
A bribe?

17:29.313 --> 17:31.064
Well, Louie,
      if we have to build

17:31.099 --> 17:33.733
a whole garage set
   out on a lot in Hollywood,

17:33.768 --> 17:36.103
that's going to cost us
        a lot of money.

17:36.137 --> 17:39.989
Well, since you're
             putting it in those
             terms, Mr. Chapman,

17:40.024 --> 17:43.427
perhaps we could do
             a little business.

17:43.461 --> 17:45.696
Would you like a
            little drink here?

17:45.730 --> 17:47.297
Yeah. How about yourself?

17:47.332 --> 17:49.065
Oh, sure,
                I'll have one.
                There's for you.

17:49.100 --> 17:50.200
Okay.

17:50.235 --> 17:52.936
And for me.

17:52.970 --> 17:58.625
Just, uh, what sort
             of figure did you
             have in mind?

17:58.659 --> 18:01.394
Well, let's say
we make you...

18:01.429 --> 18:03.697
location coordinator.

18:03.731 --> 18:05.465
( <i>grunts</i> )

18:07.668 --> 18:10.670
And we pay you...

18:12.707 --> 18:15.442
$15,000?

18:18.229 --> 18:19.729
Hmm...

18:26.037 --> 18:29.773
Well, that's not exactly
        the sort of figure

18:29.807 --> 18:33.377
that I had in mind,
           but... what the heck?

18:33.411 --> 18:35.545
You got yourself a deal.

18:35.580 --> 18:37.381
Great. Okay,
and I'll see you

18:37.415 --> 18:38.849
at the Plaza tonight.

18:38.883 --> 18:40.417
All of you.
Later, Rog.

18:40.452 --> 18:41.751
Bye-bye.
                    We'll be
                    there, Rog.

18:41.786 --> 18:43.753
Bye, Roger.

18:43.788 --> 18:45.689
Hey, Louie...

18:45.723 --> 18:48.692
what sort of figure
did you have in mind?

18:48.726 --> 18:51.745
I was going to
        ask him for $25.

18:51.780 --> 18:53.730
( <i>shouts</i> )

19:03.475 --> 19:04.942
( <i>indistinct voices</i> )

19:04.976 --> 19:07.544
Well, here's
to a great picture,

19:07.579 --> 19:09.646
a bunch
of great people,

19:09.681 --> 19:11.448
and to friendship.

19:11.483 --> 19:14.084
Am I forgetting anything?

19:14.118 --> 19:17.471
Yeah. To $15,000.

19:20.008 --> 19:22.509
How much did it cost
to stay here, Lea?

19:22.543 --> 19:24.344
Oh, it cost
               about $225 a day.

19:24.378 --> 19:27.781
Wow. Hey, Rog!

19:27.816 --> 19:29.984
You're crazy
                   spending that
                   kind of cash.

19:30.018 --> 19:32.119
Next time you're in town,
you come stay with me.

19:32.153 --> 19:33.987
Well, I guess when we
get back to New York,

19:34.021 --> 19:36.290
you're going to be seeing
a lot more of Lea, huh?

19:36.324 --> 19:37.857
( <i>phone rings</i> )
Boy, I sure hope so.

19:37.892 --> 19:40.427
But, uh, I don't think
she has any more.

19:42.530 --> 19:43.981
Excuse me,
Mr. Chapman?

19:44.015 --> 19:45.549
Yeah?

19:45.583 --> 19:47.283
It's Peter Koppelman
from Hollywood.

19:47.318 --> 19:48.568
Peter who?

19:48.602 --> 19:51.271
Koppelman. He's head of
    production at Paramount.

19:51.306 --> 19:54.541
No. John Muncie is head
  of production at Paramount.

19:54.575 --> 19:56.410
No, there's been
     some sort of shakeup.

19:56.444 --> 19:58.428
Koppelman, who used
to be with Universal,

19:58.462 --> 19:59.496
is now at Paramount.

19:59.530 --> 20:00.764
Hawthorne,
from Columbia,

20:00.798 --> 20:02.732
is now head of production
at Universal.

20:02.767 --> 20:05.135
And Lou Green from MGM
is taking over Columbia.

20:05.169 --> 20:07.104
Then where the
                 hell is Muncie?

20:07.138 --> 20:08.505
He's at Burger King.

20:09.607 --> 20:12.375
Never mind, just
            give me the phone.

20:12.410 --> 20:14.177
Hello, Peter?
   Hey, congratulations, man.

20:14.211 --> 20:15.846
It couldn't happen
        to a nicer guy.

20:15.880 --> 20:18.548
Yeah, listen, I know you're
  probably way over your head

20:18.583 --> 20:21.150
getting settled in out there
    in the new job, and all,

20:21.185 --> 20:22.419
but have you had a chance

20:22.453 --> 20:24.287
to look at
  that cab driver script yet?

20:24.321 --> 20:25.756
You did?

20:25.790 --> 20:27.624
Oh, great.

20:27.658 --> 20:29.393
Right. I didn't like it either.

20:29.427 --> 20:31.762
You see? And that's why
   I sent it to you to read.

20:31.796 --> 20:34.197
Right, uh, but what do you think
          of the <i>idea?</i>

20:37.552 --> 20:39.152
You're canceling the project?

20:40.872 --> 20:43.022
Peter, I have two years
   of my life in this thing.

20:43.057 --> 20:44.224
Listen, I...

20:44.258 --> 20:45.459
Peter?

20:45.493 --> 20:46.793
Listen, Peter, we...

20:46.827 --> 20:49.613
we have some
     fantastic stuff here.

20:49.647 --> 20:53.149
We've got wonderful,
      warm human stories.

20:53.183 --> 20:56.002
Don't say no, man,
    until you've heard them!

20:56.037 --> 20:57.737
Wait... Alex, Alex,
        tell him the one

20:57.771 --> 20:59.906
about the baby
   that was born in your cab.

20:59.940 --> 21:00.974
Huh?
                Make it twins!

21:01.009 --> 21:02.275
( <i>whispers</i> ):
                  Make it twins.

21:02.310 --> 21:04.411
Uh, hello, Mr. Koppelman?

21:04.445 --> 21:05.645
My name is Alex Rieger.

21:05.679 --> 21:07.314
Uh, yeah, I was really thinking

21:07.348 --> 21:09.383
that this would be right
for television,

21:09.417 --> 21:12.319
but I don't see why
it can't transfer
to the big screen.

21:12.353 --> 21:13.820
Just tell him the story.

21:13.854 --> 21:15.389
Oh. Uh, well...

21:15.423 --> 21:20.394
It was a very cold night
early in January, and...

21:20.428 --> 21:22.162
You hate it already?
How can you hate it already?

21:22.196 --> 21:24.364
Lea, you used
      to go out with him.

21:24.399 --> 21:25.665
You talk to him.

21:25.699 --> 21:27.100
No, not with Koppelman.

21:27.134 --> 21:29.335
Just with Muncie
                and Hawthorne.

21:29.370 --> 21:32.122
I used to go out with him.

21:39.747 --> 21:41.915
Give me the phone!

21:41.950 --> 21:43.450
( <i>mutters</i> )

21:45.120 --> 21:46.220
Hello?

21:46.254 --> 21:48.688
Hello, Mr. Koppelman.

21:48.723 --> 21:50.858
Uh, this is
                 Louie De Palma,

21:50.892 --> 21:53.060
your location
                   coordinator.

21:53.094 --> 21:55.095
You can't cancel this picture.

21:55.129 --> 21:58.198
I already told my mother
       about the $15,000.

21:58.232 --> 22:01.067
She thinks
we're moving
to Queens.

22:01.102 --> 22:02.653
No, please,
Mr. Koppelman!

22:02.687 --> 22:04.221
Please.
I'm begging you.

22:04.255 --> 22:06.256
I'm begging...
I'm on my knees,
Mr. Koppelman.

22:06.291 --> 22:08.725
Please, please,
you got to listen
to me, please!

22:08.759 --> 22:09.859
Louie, Louie, Louie!

22:09.894 --> 22:11.127
Control yourself,
           will you?

22:11.162 --> 22:13.497
What do you mean,
who the hell am I?

22:13.531 --> 22:14.831
I just told you!

22:14.865 --> 22:17.901
I'm Louie De Palma,
your location coordinator.

22:17.935 --> 22:19.186
Now, listen to me, Koppelman.

22:19.220 --> 22:21.388
I'm warning you,
    you cancel this picture,

22:21.422 --> 22:23.157
you're going to wake up tomorrow

22:23.191 --> 22:27.027
with one of your horses'
       heads in your bed.

22:27.061 --> 22:30.113
Koppelman, I swear,
you cancel this picture,

22:30.148 --> 22:31.181
I'll kill you!

22:31.215 --> 22:32.782
I'll kill you!

22:36.671 --> 22:39.539
Can you believe that?
He hung up on me.

22:40.909 --> 22:43.744
The nerve of some people.

22:48.099 --> 22:49.516
$15,000!

22:49.551 --> 22:50.851
Louie, Louie, Louie.

22:50.885 --> 22:52.185
( <i>sobbing</i> ):
        $15,000!

22:52.219 --> 22:54.254
All right, Louie, Louie,
        listen, listen.

22:54.288 --> 22:55.756
$15,000!

22:55.790 --> 22:57.858
Louie, please. Look, you
        just had a bad break.

22:57.892 --> 22:58.859
Now, come on.
    $15,000!

22:58.893 --> 23:00.527
Come on, you
               couldn't help it.

23:00.562 --> 23:02.763
$15,000!
            There's nothing you
            could do about it.

23:02.797 --> 23:05.148
Louie, come on,
         Louie, Louie!

23:05.183 --> 23:07.617
You just got to
                be a man, Louie.

23:09.337 --> 23:10.771
Louie, Louie, look.
      Fifteen...

23:10.805 --> 23:12.339
You got to walk
                 out of here...

23:12.373 --> 23:15.141
You got to walk out of here
     with this head held high,

23:15.176 --> 23:16.276
you hear me?

23:16.311 --> 23:18.895
Hmm?

23:18.930 --> 23:20.313
Yeah.

23:22.182 --> 23:24.818
Yeah. Yeah.

23:26.988 --> 23:29.189
I just want to go
into the bathroom

23:29.224 --> 23:31.124
for a moment.

23:31.159 --> 23:33.026
Yeah.

23:34.662 --> 23:36.696
You're right, Alex.

23:36.731 --> 23:40.133
I got to keep
my head up high.

23:40.168 --> 23:42.970
As long as a man
has his pride

23:43.004 --> 23:46.439
and his dignity,
it doesn't matter

23:46.474 --> 23:49.509
what this rotten world
tries to do to him.

23:49.543 --> 23:53.146
Come on,
let's get out of here.

24:30.868 --> 24:32.169

             Night, Mr. Walters.
