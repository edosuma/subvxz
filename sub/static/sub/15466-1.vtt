have a couple hours

03:02.224 --> 03:04.100
'cause l'd like to
talk about something.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.186
Honey, in a couple of hours,

can't wait for these reports,

03:09.606 --> 03:13.609
but, uh, I can do
wonders in 30 minutes.

03:14.987 --> 03:16.487
Well, I can't.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.448

have to wait till tonight.

by the time you get there.

03:29.793 --> 03:32.503

hoping we'd have
a chance to talk now.

03:34.840 --> 03:38.050

03:42.347 --> 03:44.307
Are you back in that
same old kick about us?

lf that's what
you want to call it.

03:47.811 --> 03:50.062
Come on ! What's all
the rush all of a sudden?

03:50.147 --> 03:51.564
Rush?

03:52.649 --> 03:56.402
l've been on
this particular kick
for six years now.

03:56.778 --> 03:59.322
Maybe l'm tired of
one-night stands.

Look, baby,
l've only got
half an hour.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.412
Can't we talk it out
when you get to L.A.?

04:06.496 --> 04:08.205
Don't miss your
flight, Murdock.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.958
You wouldn't want to keep
that boss of yours waiting.

04:11.043 --> 04:12.251
But. . .

05:13.730 --> 05:15.147
Did you enjoy your
stay in our city,
Miss Swanson?

05:15.232 --> 05:16.232
Yes, I did.

Now, we can't have her off
the dialysis machine too long.

You really want to

the way to Hawaii?

07:03.340 --> 07:04.924
What's wrong with that?

07:05.008 --> 07:07.009
Nothing,
if you have
an all-girl crew.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.594
My first mate

07:27.114 --> 07:29.198
You're weird.
You know that?

07:33.328 --> 07:34.995
How do you get
rid of this jet lag?

07:35.122 --> 07:36.789
You just do.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.375
Why? You still

of that for you.

46:27.326 --> 46:30.203
Now, I want you to
get hold of yourself.

46:30.872 --> 46:33.123
We're the ones who are going
to have to go down there

46:33.207 --> 46:35.125
and calm everybody else.

46:35.209 --> 46:36.710
What is going to happen?

46:36.794 --> 46:39.296
They're going to
land the plane somehow.

46:39.380 --> 46:40.380
How?

46:42.508 --> 46:46.803
l don't know, but l
want you to go down there

46:47.555 --> 46:50.474
and tell everyone
that everything is
going to be all right.

46:50.558 --> 46:53.852
We have to give them
something to hope for.

47:02.403 --> 47:04.029
Damn it, I just got off
the horn with the boss

47:04.113 --> 47:05.280
and l'm gonna
handle things here!

47:05.364 --> 47:07.324
Now keep this line open !

47:09.118 --> 47:12.579
They're gonna have to make
a course correction
or hit the mountains.

47:12.663 --> 47:15.582
l want Al Murdock on this.
Try his apartment.

47:16.584 --> 47:18.793
Now, listen, how much
time do you estimate

47:18.920 --> 47:21.213
before a course
correction is needed?

47:21.464 --> 47:22.839
Ouch.

47:22.924 --> 47:24.758
All right, hang on.

47:25.593 --> 47:28.553
Have them get Exec One ready.
We're gonna take
the Lear to Salt Lake.

47:28.638 --> 47:31.806
All right, I understand.
Now, we're getting
Al Murdock on this.

47:31.891 --> 47:35.143
He was our chief
instructor pilot
on 747s for four years.

47:35.228 --> 47:36.645
l'll get back to you.

47:37.480 --> 47:38.522
Bill?

47:38.606 --> 47:39.689
lt's ringing.

47:39.774 --> 47:44.027
(SlGHS) Look, you know
you're gonna have to handle
the news people on this.

47:44.111 --> 47:45.403
Later on,
when the story breaks,

47:45.488 --> 47:47.364
there's gonna be relatives
and there's gonna
be friends, too.

47:47.448 --> 47:50.200
Won't the directors
want you to handle that?

47:50.284 --> 47:53.912
My wife and son are
up there on that airplane.
l'm going to Salt Lake City.

47:53.996 --> 47:55.664
l'm sorry, Joe.

47:55.748 --> 47:57.332
How the hell
are we gonna get
that aircraft down?

47:57.416 --> 48:00.252
Damn it, I don't know!
That plane can do
almost anything.

48:00.336 --> 48:02.170
And Al Murdock knows more
about flyin' it than anybody.

48:02.255 --> 48:04.047
Now, where the hell is he?
No answer.

48:04.131 --> 48:07.384
Wait a second !
He was going out to meet 409.
Try the V. l. P. lounge.

48:07.468 --> 48:08.552
Yeah.

48:10.846 --> 48:11.972
How's it flying now?

48:12.056 --> 48:13.265
lt's on autopilot.

48:13.349 --> 48:14.432
How much damage was there?

48:14.559 --> 48:15.600
Not a great deal.

48:15.685 --> 48:19.396
There's just a big hole in it
where the pilots usually sit!

48:19.814 --> 48:20.772
(BUZZES)

48:20.856 --> 48:22.190
Yeah?

48:23.025 --> 48:26.069
Right. Exec One is
ready when you are.

48:26.153 --> 48:27.320
All right.

48:27.446 --> 48:28.572
And they're paging Murdock.

48:28.656 --> 48:30.740
Tell him to get his
ass out to Exec One.

48:30.825 --> 48:33.493
WOMAN ON P.A. :
Al Murdock, emergency call.

48:34.161 --> 48:35.579
Al Murdock.

48:39.875 --> 48:40.917
Alan Murdock.

48:41.043 --> 48:42.085
Al, it's Bill.

48:42.169 --> 48:44.671
What's up? They said
it was an emergency.

48:44.755 --> 48:46.089
lt is.

48:49.969 --> 48:51.344
My God.

48:52.013 --> 48:54.681
Yeah. You sure it's 409?

48:56.601 --> 48:59.853
Yeah, I understand.
l'm. . . l'm on my way.

49:01.689 --> 49:04.899
l'm so frightened.
What has happened?
Why won't you tell us?

49:04.984 --> 49:07.569
Ma'am, we'll let you know
as soon as we know ourselves.

49:07.653 --> 49:09.571
There's nothing. . .
Miss!

49:09.655 --> 49:10.947
What's the matter,
Mr. Rogers?

49:11.032 --> 49:12.157
Where are
the oxygen masks?

49:12.241 --> 49:14.534
We're below 14,000 feet.
You don't need them.

49:14.619 --> 49:16.536
Everything will
be fine, really.

49:16.621 --> 49:18.955
What about the mountains?
We're flying into
the mountains.

49:19.040 --> 49:22.959
Everything will be just fine.
Now, sit back and relax.
We'll be okay.

49:23.044 --> 49:24.544
Can I help?

49:39.060 --> 49:41.311
Mother? Mother?

49:42.229 --> 49:43.772
lt'll be okay.

49:47.693 --> 49:49.819
(lNAUDlBLE)

50:12.718 --> 50:16.054
Darling, l'm gonna go
and see if I can help,

50:16.138 --> 50:18.014
but I want you to stay
right in your seat.

50:18.140 --> 50:20.183
Do you want me
to come with you?
No.

50:20.267 --> 50:24.729
And Mom, remember,
the 747's the best
aircraft ever made.

50:24.814 --> 50:28.358
Remember,
it can almost fly by itself.
Dad calls it the big pussycat.

50:28.442 --> 50:29.818
l remember.

50:37.618 --> 50:39.703
ALAN: (OVER RADlO)
Nancy, this is Al, honey.

50:39.787 --> 50:41.871
We're in Exec One on
the way to Salt Lake.

50:41.956 --> 50:44.624
We've cleared this frequency.
Do you read me?

50:45.710 --> 50:46.793
NANCY: Yes, I read you.

50:46.919 --> 50:47.961
ALAN: Fine.

50:48.045 --> 50:49.754
We don't have too much time.

50:49.839 --> 50:51.798
l want you to sit
in the pilot's seat

50:51.966 --> 50:53.925
and do exactly
what I tell you.

50:55.803 --> 50:57.011
O. . . Okay.

51:05.980 --> 51:07.230
Ready.

51:07.314 --> 51:09.274
Now, look at the
instrument panel.

51:09.358 --> 51:12.152
The altimeter is
marked A-L-T.

51:13.362 --> 51:14.487
l know that.

51:14.572 --> 51:16.573
What does it read, honey?

51:17.241 --> 51:19.367
Twelve thousand feet.

51:19.452 --> 51:22.662
Fine. The airspeed
indicator is to the left.

51:24.707 --> 51:28.084
l know that too. lt's 192.

51:28.169 --> 51:32.297
Okay, honey, take it easy.
Now I want you to
find the autopilot.

51:33.174 --> 51:34.674
Look to your right

51:34.759 --> 51:37.969
at the top of the panel
just below the windshield.

51:38.053 --> 51:39.763
There's a switch
marked "autopilot."

51:39.847 --> 51:42.932
lt says "command,"
"manual" and "off."

51:43.017 --> 51:45.018
l see it.
Don't touch it.

51:45.102 --> 51:47.353
ls it in manual?

51:47.855 --> 51:50.356
lt's on manual. lt's on.

51:52.818 --> 51:57.363
l don't hear you, honey.
Nancy, press your mike button.

51:59.325 --> 52:00.950
Yes.

52:01.035 --> 52:05.079
Fine. Now, we don't have
anything to worry about.

52:05.164 --> 52:07.999
We're just gonna help
the autopilot make a turn.

52:08.083 --> 52:10.460
Do exactly what I tell you.

52:10.544 --> 52:13.671
Put your hand to
the right of the console.

52:13.756 --> 52:14.964
The what?

52:15.049 --> 52:17.634
The flat panel just
below the throttles.

52:17.718 --> 52:21.095
There's a gray knob
about the size of
a milk bottle top.

52:21.180 --> 52:22.806
l see it.

52:22.890 --> 52:26.893
Okay. Now slowly
turn it to the right.

52:40.115 --> 52:42.408
Nothing's happening.

52:44.787 --> 52:48.915
Okay, honey, try it
to the left slowly.

52:57.466 --> 53:00.343
NANCY: lt's not working.
There's nothing happening.

53:00.427 --> 53:02.428
lt's not turning the plane.

53:03.347 --> 53:05.890
Jesus, it's not
working for turns.

53:06.934 --> 53:09.519
Can't you tell us
what's happening up there?

53:09.603 --> 53:14.023
They want us to change course
just like I told you.
lt's a very simple thing.

53:14.108 --> 53:17.110
There is a pilot on the radio
telling her what to do,

53:17.194 --> 53:20.113
telling her exactly
how to do it.

53:23.117 --> 53:25.451
Pardon me. What "her"?

53:26.245 --> 53:29.163
The first stewardess
is at the controls.

53:29.248 --> 53:32.625
But she is in constant
touch with the tower.

53:33.127 --> 53:34.711
You mean, the stewardess
is flying the plane?

53:34.795 --> 53:36.629
Please keep
your voice down.
Sure.

53:38.340 --> 53:41.050
The stewardess is
flying the plane.

53:41.135 --> 53:44.679
The stewardess is. . .
Thank you, Mrs. Devaney,
but I don't drink.

53:44.763 --> 53:46.973
What difference
does it make now?

53:47.808 --> 53:49.309
You're right.

53:52.938 --> 53:54.439
No difference.

53:58.611 --> 53:59.694
Alan?

54:01.989 --> 54:03.907
l'm scared.

54:03.991 --> 54:06.576
You're doing
just fine, honey.

54:06.660 --> 54:08.161
There's a problem
with the autopilot.

54:08.329 --> 54:09.871
lt'll keep you
straight and level,

54:09.955 --> 54:13.666
but l'm gonna have to help
you make the turns yourself.

54:15.836 --> 54:17.003
l'm going to turn the plane?

54:17.171 --> 54:18.296
No sweat.

54:18.380 --> 54:20.381
Put both hands
on the wheel.

54:20.466 --> 54:23.092
There's a button
under your left thumb.
Press it.

54:24.511 --> 54:25.553
(ALARM BUZZlNG)

54:25.638 --> 54:27.263
What's that?

54:27.348 --> 54:30.642
Don't worry.
That's just an alarm.
Press it again.

54:31.060 --> 54:32.101
(ALARM STOPS)

54:32.186 --> 54:33.519
Okay.

54:33.604 --> 54:36.481
All right, honey,
now you've got
the airplane.

54:36.565 --> 54:39.192
Just hold it steady
until I tell you.

54:40.027 --> 54:44.030
l want you to find
the artificial horizon
on the instrument panel.

54:44.114 --> 54:48.284
That's the little airplane
with the horizontal
line through it.

54:56.043 --> 54:57.251
Alan?

54:59.004 --> 55:01.005
l can't do this.

55:01.090 --> 55:04.050
Why not?
You can do it, Nancy!

55:05.219 --> 55:07.095
Nancy, come in!

55:09.390 --> 55:11.766
Goddamn it, answer!

55:13.686 --> 55:16.688
Okay. Okay, l'm gonna try it.

55:18.899 --> 55:19.899
(SlGHS)

55:19.984 --> 55:21.776
You scared the hell
outta me, honey.

55:21.860 --> 55:23.569
What do you think I am?

55:25.739 --> 55:29.409
Okay. What's your
altimeter read, Nancy?

55:31.120 --> 55:33.830
11,500 feet.

55:33.914 --> 55:35.915
That's good. All right now.

55:37.001 --> 55:38.626
Turn to the right.

55:39.586 --> 55:42.797
Turn the wheel to
the right slow and easy.

55:47.261 --> 55:48.845
NANCY: Turning.

55:48.929 --> 55:51.514
Good. Read me your airspeed.

55:51.598 --> 55:52.849
lt's going down.

55:52.933 --> 55:55.560
lt's only 184.

55:55.644 --> 55:58.271
lt's still all right.
Just keep turning.

56:00.065 --> 56:03.234
183. . . 182.

56:03.318 --> 56:06.654
She's climbing in the turn.
Get her nose down
or she's gonna stall.

56:06.739 --> 56:08.614
Not till she
finishes the turn.

56:09.575 --> 56:11.200
What's your airspeed now?

56:11.285 --> 56:13.119
180. lt's on 180.

56:13.537 --> 56:17.915
All right. Now, turn
the wheel to the left again
till it comes level.

56:22.629 --> 56:25.840
ALAN: Now ease the wheel
forward just a little.

56:25.924 --> 56:28.551
Watch the little airplane
in the instrument.

56:28.635 --> 56:31.095
Don't let it
fall below the line.

56:31.180 --> 56:33.306
Wings on the horizontal line.

56:36.602 --> 56:38.019
All right.

56:38.103 --> 56:39.228
Okay.

56:39.646 --> 56:42.190
Let the autopilot
take it back now.

56:42.274 --> 56:45.234
Turn the switch
in the top panel
back to manual.

56:50.449 --> 56:52.617
Take your hands off the wheel.

56:53.368 --> 56:55.161
ls the airplane level?

56:55.662 --> 56:56.996
NANCY: Yes.

56:57.164 --> 56:58.498
Good job, honey.

56:58.832 --> 57:00.792
You take a rest now.

57:00.876 --> 57:02.877
We're almost to Salt Lake.

57:08.801 --> 57:11.385
We got a big problem.
Look here.

57:11.470 --> 57:13.805
There's Salt Lake
City and there's 409.

57:13.889 --> 57:15.473
Look at the terrain
in between.

57:15.557 --> 57:18.267
There is no way
we can talk Nancy
through those mountains

57:18.352 --> 57:19.977
and down through
a safe landing.

57:20.062 --> 57:22.105
lt's just too much for her.

57:22.189 --> 57:24.982
The only way is to
put a pilot into 409.

57:25.067 --> 57:26.734
You mean a midair transfer?

57:26.819 --> 57:28.736
A jet helicopter is
fast enough to keep up.

57:28.821 --> 57:30.238
We can put a man
out on a tether.

57:30.322 --> 57:32.490
Do you know what it
would be to put a man
through that hole?

57:32.574 --> 57:35.076
Goddamn it!
There isn't any
other way!

57:35.160 --> 57:38.079
l think he's right.
The only question is who?

57:38.997 --> 57:40.998
Me.
No, Al, you're
too damn big.

57:41.083 --> 57:42.792
What the hell you gonna do?
Go shopping for somebody?

57:42.876 --> 57:43.918
Right!

57:44.002 --> 57:46.295
l'll call Hill
Air Force Base.
They're the experts.

57:47.214 --> 57:48.965
You mean to tell me
you're going to try

57:49.049 --> 57:51.592
to transfer a pilot
into a 747 in flight?

57:51.677 --> 57:53.553
That's right.
We need your cooperation

57:53.720 --> 57:55.638
and the fastest
helicopter you've got.

57:55.722 --> 57:57.098
Now, wait a minute.

57:57.182 --> 57:59.600
You intend to
put one of our men
on an umbilical?

57:59.685 --> 58:00.643
That's it!

58:00.727 --> 58:02.478
How's he going to get inside?

58:02.563 --> 58:04.605
The way the stewardess
described the hole

58:04.690 --> 58:05.982
torn on the flight deck,
it's big enough.

58:07.151 --> 58:10.444
lf you'll excuse me, sir
l think it's one hell
of a stupid idea.

58:10.529 --> 58:12.405
That's all we've got,
Lieutenant!

58:12.489 --> 58:13.906
Now, what have you
got to help us?

58:13.991 --> 58:17.076
There's only one man
who's ever done
anything like this.

58:17.161 --> 58:19.078
A Major John Alexander.

58:19.163 --> 58:21.622
He's in air rescue.
l can try to contact him.

58:21.707 --> 58:23.958
You know how urgent. . .
Who is your
commanding officer?

58:24.835 --> 58:26.502
Uh. . . Colonel Moss, sir.

58:26.587 --> 58:28.880
Thank you.
This is Exec One out.

58:31.592 --> 58:35.094
(SlGHS) Now the question is,
can we get there in time?

59:13.508 --> 59:16.260
RADlO: Columbia 409,
Salt Lake Approach.

59:16.345 --> 59:18.846
We need another
instrument reading, Nancy.

59:18.931 --> 59:20.973
Come in, Columbia 409.

59:21.850 --> 59:25.645
Nancy, come in, please.
Come in, Nancy.

59:43.330 --> 59:47.041
PlLOT: Salt Lake Approach,
air force T37-Sage 14,

59:47.125 --> 59:49.001
approaching Columbia 747.

59:49.711 --> 59:52.129
The aircraft is
in level flight.

59:52.214 --> 59:54.131
The flaps are 10 degrees
since the collision

59:54.216 --> 59:56.384
occurred during
descent into Salt Lake.

59:57.761 --> 01:00:00.721
Look, Mom, there's another
airplane out there.

01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:02.431
Where?

01:00:02.516 --> 01:00:03.683
Right out there!

01:00:06.728 --> 01:00:08.854
Oh, my God, there is.

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:10.523
An air force jet.

01:00:13.193 --> 01:00:15.236
PlLOT: Jesus Christ,
you can't believe this!

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:18.114
There's a big hole
on the starboard
side of the flight deck.

01:00:18.198 --> 01:00:20.574
Doesn't look like there's
any other damage
to the aircraft.

01:00:20.659 --> 01:00:23.327
All four engines
seem to be running.

01:00:23.412 --> 01:00:25.454
Hard to tell how
much instrument damage.

01:00:25.539 --> 01:00:27.415
lt looks like most of it's
near the engineer's panel.

01:00:27.499 --> 01:00:29.292
Front part looks okay.

01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:32.295
He's probably
checking the damage.

01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:33.587
l'll bet he's gonna help us.

01:00:33.672 --> 01:00:34.797
He is!

01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:39.218
Can you see
the fighter now, Nancy?
lt should be on your right.

01:00:40.262 --> 01:00:41.971
Yes, I see it.

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:45.099
He's gonna look you over
and report the damage.
Stand by.

01:00:48.103 --> 01:00:50.563
Nancy, the executive plane
is landing here now.

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:53.733
We're gonna have some help
up to you real soon.

01:00:56.028 --> 01:00:57.611
Good.

01:01:05.537 --> 01:01:08.372
Do you really think
they can do anything?

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:11.667
l know they'll
do everything
that can be done.

01:01:11.752 --> 01:01:13.753
You betcha!
My dad runs
the airlines.

01:01:14.588 --> 01:01:16.255
JOSEPH: Well, almost.

01:01:16.715 --> 01:01:20.009
What does he mean about
"running" this airline?

01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:23.429
My husband is vice
president of operations.

01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:26.015
Ha. Some operations!

01:01:34.775 --> 01:01:35.941
PlLOT: Uh-oh.

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:39.070
There's a little crease
on the inboard section
of the starboard wing.

01:01:39.154 --> 01:01:41.655
l see some fuel coming
off the trailing edge.

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:45.034
Man, if this had happened
at 20,000 feet, forget it.

01:01:47.788 --> 01:01:51.540
Plot a rendezvous point.
Have the 47 make a 180
and bring her back.

01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:53.793
We'll have to.
We've gotta make
sure she holds altitude.

01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:55.544
Col. Moss is on his
way from Hill Air Base.

01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:56.670
What's the fuel situation?

01:01:56.755 --> 01:01:58.672
There's enough, but we do
have a complication.

01:01:58.757 --> 01:02:00.174
The air force
sent up a fighter
to look things over.

01:02:00.258 --> 01:02:02.218
He says there's a fuel
leak on the right wing.

01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:04.095
Oh, damn !

01:02:04.179 --> 01:02:06.138
That Nancy's some woman.

01:02:06.598 --> 01:02:07.890
She better be.

01:02:08.016 --> 01:02:09.350
How much do you
think we can
ask of her?

01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:10.935
There's a call
for you, Mr. Patroni.

01:02:11.019 --> 01:02:12.978
Everything, I guess.

01:02:14.314 --> 01:02:15.481
Yeah?

01:02:17.192 --> 01:02:19.026
Your information is
correct, Mr. Purcell,

01:02:19.111 --> 01:02:21.570
but we're
clearing everything out
of our Los Angeles office.

01:02:21.655 --> 01:02:23.155
You can understand
that our concern here

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.199
is for the safety of
those people. Excuse me.

01:02:25.283 --> 01:02:26.909
Who's that?
A guy named Purcell.

01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:30.037
Owns a local TV station.
He's sending
a remote unit out.

01:02:30.122 --> 01:02:32.456
What the hell does
he want to photograph?
We don't have any bodies yet!

01:02:32.541 --> 01:02:33.707
Take it easy, damn it.

01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:35.626
We're gonna need
all the good press
we can get.

01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:37.002
Now let's go find
that colonel

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:40.005
and get that
rendezvous course plotted
and on the boards.

01:02:41.466 --> 01:02:43.843
Oh, my jewel case.

01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:47.263
lt's bombproofed.
The insurance people
insisted upon it.

01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:51.350
Oh, my idea of heaven
is never to have
to pack or unpack.

01:02:51.435 --> 01:02:53.102
Why didn't I think
of that before?

01:02:53.186 --> 01:02:54.353
Here.

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.566
Here. You know what?

01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:01.986
To hell with the jewelry.
Let's put my book in here.

01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:06.240
Thank you.

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:12.121
Here you are,
my darlings.
lt's all yours.

01:03:12.205 --> 01:03:16.709
l never wanted to have
the damn thing published
while I was alive, anyway!

01:03:28.013 --> 01:03:29.972
Colonel, is this
thing gonna work?

01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:32.808
lt's gonna be like
trying to put a raw
egg back in its shell.

01:03:32.893 --> 01:03:34.977
Your pilot confirmed
what the stewardess told us.

01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:36.562
The hole looks
like it's big enough.

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:39.106
lt's a hell
of a risk, a long shot!
l gotta tell you that.

01:03:39.191 --> 01:03:41.484
lt's the only shot we got!
How long before that
helicopter gets here?

01:03:41.568 --> 01:03:43.277
About 10 minutes.
lt's refueling right now.

01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:44.487
Mean time I gotta
clear with Washington.

01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:45.738
All right, make it fast.

01:03:53.872 --> 01:03:56.999
Do we have any morphine
in the first-aid kit?

01:03:57.083 --> 01:04:00.002
No. l'm sure we
have some sedatives.

01:04:00.086 --> 01:04:01.253
No.

01:04:02.297 --> 01:04:03.422
Help.

01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:05.758
Yes, we'll help you.

01:04:05.884 --> 01:04:07.635
lt'll put you to sleep.

01:04:07.719 --> 01:04:09.053
No!

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:13.724
Maybe. . .

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:16.977
Help.

01:04:18.605 --> 01:04:21.065
l understand.
He wants to
stay conscious

01:04:21.149 --> 01:04:22.900
in case he can
help us later on.

01:04:30.617 --> 01:04:33.285
RADlO: Salt Lake Approach.
Do you read me, Nancy?

01:04:33.662 --> 01:04:35.538
This is Nancy. Go ahead.

01:04:35.622 --> 01:04:37.164
ln a little while,
we're gonna take
you through

01:04:37.249 --> 01:04:40.125
a 180 degree turn
like we did before.

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:43.462
Captain Murdock will
talk you through it.
No sweat, okay?

01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:48.050
l'm not looking
forward to it.

01:04:48.134 --> 01:04:50.386
Just hang in there,
Nancy. You'll do fine.

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:51.845
You're doing great, honey.

01:04:52.347 --> 01:04:55.683
We want you to look at
the flight engineer's panel

01:04:55.767 --> 01:04:58.477
in the center
just above the desk.

01:04:58.562 --> 01:05:02.356
Tell us what the third
fuel used gauge reads. Over.

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:17.830
Uh. . .

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:21.875
Twenty two thousand,
500 pounds.
Why, is something wrong?

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:25.170
No. We just want to keep track
of the rate of fuel flow.

01:05:26.214 --> 01:05:27.423
We're not running low, are we?

01:05:27.549 --> 01:05:28.757
No chance.

01:05:28.842 --> 01:05:31.760
There's always
an extra amount just in case.

01:05:31.845 --> 01:05:34.346
Besides that,
the captain always
adds a few thousand pounds

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:37.641
for his wife,
kids, his mother,
even his mother-in-law.

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:43.522
Nancy. Come in, Nancy.

01:05:51.865 --> 01:05:54.199
Hello, this is Nancy.
Can you hear me?

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:58.829
Come in, 409.
Nancy, do you read me?

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:16.096
Flight 409 calling Salt Lake.

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:19.141
Nancy! Come in, 409!

01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:24.855
This is flight 409
calling Salt Lake. Come in.

01:06:32.072 --> 01:06:34.573
Columbia 409
calling Salt Lake.

01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:35.741
lt just went out.

01:06:35.867 --> 01:06:36.909
l'll try it.

01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:39.620
Columbia 409.
Do you read, Nancy?

01:06:39.913 --> 01:06:41.705
Come in. Come in !

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:48.671
This is flight 409
calling Salt Lake. Come in.

01:06:48.755 --> 01:06:50.255
l've got her.
What's the frequency?

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:51.757
125.4.

01:06:53.385 --> 01:06:56.553
This is Salt Lake.
409, come in.
Can you read me?

01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:58.972
Yes, thank God !

01:07:00.058 --> 01:07:01.100
What happened?

01:07:01.601 --> 01:07:04.687
A piece of wreckage
fell onto the radio panel.

01:07:06.106 --> 01:07:08.774
Don't change anything.
Just stand by.

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:11.443
Standing. . .

01:07:12.696 --> 01:07:14.196
Standing by.

01:07:16.616 --> 01:07:18.075
Nancy?

01:07:22.122 --> 01:07:23.706
Are you all right?

01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:25.624
Yeah, l'm all right.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.378
How is it down there?

01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:30.879
lt's better.

01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:37.594
The sight of another plane
kinda perked everybody up.

01:07:51.985 --> 01:07:53.360
Look at this.

01:07:53.445 --> 01:07:54.445
What is it?

01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:55.529
l don't know.

01:07:59.784 --> 01:08:01.160
lt looks like
it's cracked.

01:08:02.704 --> 01:08:04.329
What is it?
What's the matter?

01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:06.582
There's some fluid
coming out of the wing.

01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:09.001
Did you hear that?
There's some gas
coming out of the wing.

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:10.586
Didn't I tell you
before I don't want
to hear that?

01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:11.754
l don't want to hear it!

01:08:11.838 --> 01:08:13.464
He doesn't want
to hear it. Oh, wow.

01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:26.769
What the hell
is all of that?

01:08:26.853 --> 01:08:29.854
That'll be Mr. Purcell.
TV has arrived.

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:33.942
He knows everybody in town.
He'll get clearance
to come up here.

01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:39.113
Leave her alone!

01:08:39.532 --> 01:08:42.283
(lNDlSTlNCT CHATTlNG)

01:08:46.706 --> 01:08:48.874
You just sit here.
l'll be back in a minute,
Mrs. Freeman.

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:50.584
And don't worry!

01:08:57.216 --> 01:08:59.218
Mr. Patroni?
Yeah.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:02.345
Glenn Purcell, KSL-TV.

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:04.305
Now I know how
busy you must be,

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:07.810
but we're going on a special
nationwide network hook-up.

01:09:07.894 --> 01:09:09.019
l'm sorry, l'm busy.

01:09:09.103 --> 01:09:12.564
Sir, this happens to
be a very big story.

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:14.107
We have Mrs. Freeman
downstairs

01:09:14.192 --> 01:09:15.609
and I thought the
two of you together. . .

01:09:15.693 --> 01:09:17.486
Who's Mrs. Freeman?

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:21.240
You know, the private
pilot that went down.
She is his wife.

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:23.575
What the hell's
she doing here?

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:26.662
Trying to locate her husband.
Have they found him yet?

01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:28.747
Mr. Purcell,
we don't know.

01:09:28.832 --> 01:09:30.916
The highway patrol
was alerted at the
time of the collision.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.042
Why don't you
go talk to them?

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:35.337
You mean you haven't
bothered to find out?

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:38.590
No, because we're
too busy trying to save
the 120 that are up there!

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:41.969
Why don't you just let us
get on with our job?

01:09:42.053 --> 01:09:45.555
lt seems to me
it would be good public
relations to talk with her.

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:47.808
l mean, it was your plane
that killed him, wasn't it?

01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:50.519
Listen, you son of a bitch !

01:09:50.603 --> 01:09:52.770
Take it easy! Joe!

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:55.691
Take it easy you said. Right?

01:09:57.193 --> 01:10:00.821
Al, you know, sometimes
the public's right to know

01:10:00.905 --> 01:10:03.240
gives me a huge
pain in the ass.

01:10:10.915 --> 01:10:12.332
We've got a problem,
Mr. Patroni.

01:10:12.417 --> 01:10:13.792
Yeah?

01:10:13.877 --> 01:10:17.004
We may lose radio contact.
We can barely read her.

01:10:17.088 --> 01:10:19.172
And she's having
the same trouble.

01:10:19.257 --> 01:10:20.799
What about another
frequency?

01:10:20.925 --> 01:10:22.467
l'm afraid to let her try.

01:10:22.552 --> 01:10:24.386
We might lose what we have.

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:27.139
We gotta get
started, Joe. Now.

01:10:27.807 --> 01:10:32.227
409, 409, this is Joe Patroni.
How do you read me, Nancy?

01:10:32.312 --> 01:10:34.479
Not very well,
Mr. Patroni.

01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:38.859
How about now?

01:10:40.278 --> 01:10:42.696
l can barely read
you, Mr. Patroni.

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:44.823
Nancy, is that my husband?

01:10:44.908 --> 01:10:46.241
Yes.

01:10:46.326 --> 01:10:48.076
Let me talk to him.

01:10:51.789 --> 01:10:53.040
Joe!

01:10:53.124 --> 01:10:56.001
Joe, this is Helen.
Can you hear me?

01:10:58.421 --> 01:10:59.463
Yeah.

01:10:59.547 --> 01:11:03.175
You're all doing
a great job, honey.
We're proud of you.

01:11:03.718 --> 01:11:07.721
We're doing everything
that we can here,
and we're almost ready.

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:11.350
We. . . We have faith in you.

01:11:12.185 --> 01:11:13.894
Ah, how is the captain?

01:11:13.978 --> 01:11:15.395
ln pain.

01:11:16.356 --> 01:11:18.273
Well, he's a good man.

01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:21.193
How. . .
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:11:21.611 --> 01:11:23.695
How's Joe, Jr.?

01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:26.949
He's fine!

01:11:30.370 --> 01:11:31.703
We love you !

01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:45.133
PURCELL: Ladies and gentlemen,

01:11:45.218 --> 01:11:47.803
tension is thick here at
Salt Lake City Airport.

01:11:47.887 --> 01:11:50.472
Just arriving is
the air force helicopter.

01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:53.141
Major John Alexander
will make a dramatic attempt

01:11:53.226 --> 01:11:55.811
to rescue 120
persons trapped aboard

01:11:55.895 --> 01:11:59.231
a giant jetliner
without pilot
and without crew.

01:11:59.607 --> 01:12:03.318
And tragedy within
tragedy, one of them,
a young girl dying,

01:12:03.403 --> 01:12:05.696
unless she's delivered
to Los Angeles soon

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:08.073
for a kidney
transplant operation.

01:12:10.576 --> 01:12:14.496
Major Alexander
has volunteered to make
this daring attempt.

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:18.000
He will be lowered
on a line from
the air force helicopter,

01:12:18.084 --> 01:12:19.751
and try to crawl
through the hole

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:23.088
torn into the body
of the jumbo jetliner.

01:12:24.007 --> 01:12:25.674
Here they are now.

01:12:35.435 --> 01:12:37.269
What a moment this is.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:49.614
This is KSL-TV.
Would you. . .

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:52.325
We want to. . .

01:13:04.839 --> 01:13:07.049
ALAN: All right.
We're ready here, Nancy.

01:13:07.133 --> 01:13:10.385
Remember, I'll tell you
everything you have to do.

01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:11.970
You can do it.

01:13:12.305 --> 01:13:14.264
l can't hear you
very well.

01:13:14.974 --> 01:13:18.143
Take it easy, honey.
Very slow.

01:13:18.352 --> 01:13:19.936
Are you ready?

01:13:21.773 --> 01:13:23.148
Ready.

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:26.985
All right. We're going to turn
you around to a new heading,

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:30.489
260 degrees.

01:13:30.573 --> 01:13:32.240
We don't want you
to lose altitude,

01:13:32.325 --> 01:13:34.785
so we'll do it
very slow and easy.

01:13:35.203 --> 01:13:38.830
Now first you have to
turn off the autopilot.

01:13:39.791 --> 01:13:41.875
Put both hands on the wheel.

01:13:42.168 --> 01:13:44.836
There's a button
under your left thumb.

01:13:46.672 --> 01:13:48.006
Press it.

01:13:49.884 --> 01:13:52.761
There now, honey,
you've got the airplane.

01:13:53.012 --> 01:13:56.348
Now, read me your
compass heading.

01:13:57.016 --> 01:13:58.517
Compass?

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:01.853
Okay. The arrow is on the "S."

01:14:02.105 --> 01:14:05.107
Okay. Look at the numbers.

01:14:05.191 --> 01:14:09.903
We're gonna turn until
it reads 260 degrees.

01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:12.030
Are you ready?

01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:14.324
Ready.

01:14:15.493 --> 01:14:17.285
Turn the wheel to the right.

01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:19.955
Easy now. Not too much.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:28.338
You're doing fine, honey!
Just watch the little
plane in the horizon.

01:14:29.006 --> 01:14:30.465
l'm watching.

01:14:34.387 --> 01:14:36.930
Now, read me the altimeter.

01:14:38.891 --> 01:14:41.518
8,000 feet. Eight.

01:14:41.602 --> 01:14:45.313
Read it again, honey.
Read it as it changes.

01:14:45.857 --> 01:14:48.900
Seven-nine. Seven-eight.

01:14:50.528 --> 01:14:52.070
She's gotta get
that altitude back.

01:14:52.238 --> 01:14:53.822
She's only got
1,500 feet to play with.

01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:58.326
Keep turning just the way
you're doing, honey,

01:14:58.411 --> 01:15:01.329
but at the same time
ease the wheel back

01:15:01.414 --> 01:15:04.457
until you see the little
plane lift up a bit.

01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:08.962
Nancy, have you done that?

01:15:10.423 --> 01:15:12.090
Yes, I think so.

01:15:13.885 --> 01:15:15.552
What's your airspeed?

01:15:19.974 --> 01:15:22.684
One-eight. . . 188.

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:24.936
188. Do you read me?

01:15:25.021 --> 01:15:26.938
l read you fine, honey.

01:15:27.565 --> 01:15:30.442
Now, what's your heading?
Your compass heading?

01:15:32.445 --> 01:15:34.946
240, 2-4-0.

01:15:36.324 --> 01:15:39.743
There's a 13,000-foot mountain
right in front of her.

01:15:45.625 --> 01:15:47.626
ALAN: Read me
that again, Nancy.

01:15:49.212 --> 01:15:53.048
That's 255, 2-5-5.

01:15:53.799 --> 01:15:57.219
All right. Ease the wheel
to the left now, Nancy.

01:15:57.303 --> 01:15:58.720
To the left a little.

01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:01.139
Nice and slow. Not too much.

01:16:08.814 --> 01:16:11.066
Tell me what's
happening, Nancy.

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:14.527
Press your mike
button, honey.

01:16:15.613 --> 01:16:17.239
NANCY: We're turning back.

01:16:17.323 --> 01:16:21.117
The little airplane
is tilting to the left,
l mean back.

01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:24.871
ALAN: All right, that's fine.
Bring it back to level.

01:16:24.956 --> 01:16:26.998
Watch the little airplane.

01:16:28.042 --> 01:16:29.626
All right, level now.

01:16:30.544 --> 01:16:34.506
What's the airspeed now?
The airspeed, read it to me.

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.259
180.

01:16:37.343 --> 01:16:38.927
Now the altimeter.

01:16:39.011 --> 01:16:41.846
lt's just over 10,000 feet.

01:16:41.931 --> 01:16:43.932
She's still too low.

01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:46.559
Let George take
it back now, Nancy.

01:16:46.644 --> 01:16:48.687
Put it back on autopilot.

01:16:52.233 --> 01:16:54.109
You're doing
just great, honey.

01:16:54.193 --> 01:16:56.778
That helicopter's
ready, gentlemen.

01:16:57.321 --> 01:17:00.156
The helicopter's ready.
We're going to
be taking off now.

01:17:00.241 --> 01:17:02.534
We'll be with you
in a little while.

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:03.910
She's gonna have to
have more altitude

01:17:03.995 --> 01:17:05.954
or she's gonna take the tops
right off those mountains.

01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:07.956
lt's going to be tight
if we're gonna
make that rendezvous.

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.040
You want to take it, Joe?

01:17:09.959 --> 01:17:11.293
l'm going with you, Al.

01:17:11.836 --> 01:17:13.295
DANTON: I can do it.

01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:20.010
Her altitude's critical.
For God's sake, watch it!

01:17:20.094 --> 01:17:23.138
We've been damn lucky so far.
Let's not push it.

01:17:23.222 --> 01:17:25.056
Try not to rattle her.

01:17:27.393 --> 01:17:30.854
DANTON: All right now,
Nancy, we're gonna
watch your altitude.

01:17:43.743 --> 01:17:47.662
And all of you
across the nation
are seeing it as it happens.

01:17:49.081 --> 01:17:51.124
The rescue team is going
to the helicopter now.

01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:52.584
Gentlemen. . .

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:54.836
Gentlemen, may
l have a few words?

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:57.630
How do you propose
to slow the jet down?

01:18:57.066 --> 01:18:58.358
Nancy?

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:02.487
l'm scared !

01:19:03.823 --> 01:19:05.198
l am too.

01:19:07.827 --> 01:19:09.994
(SCREAMS)

01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:11.496
Nancy, look!

01:19:12.498 --> 01:19:15.333
Nancy? Are you all right?

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:17.836
Nancy, what happened?

01:19:30.266 --> 01:19:33.768
Salt Lake,
this is Columbia 409.

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:36.438
Come in.

01:19:38.399 --> 01:19:41.151
Salt Lake, this is
Columbia 409. Come in.

01:19:42.987 --> 01:19:45.572
409, this is Salt Lake.
Do you read me?

01:19:47.366 --> 01:19:50.452
Come in, 409. This is
Salt Lake. Do you read?

01:19:50.536 --> 01:19:52.287
409. Come in please.

01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:54.289
What's wrong?

01:19:55.833 --> 01:19:57.625
l don't hear anybody.

01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:02.130
The frequencies.

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:11.473
Salt Lake, come in.

01:20:12.016 --> 01:20:14.142
Nancy, come in.
Do you read me?

01:20:17.897 --> 01:20:19.939
Salt Lake, come in please.

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:22.192
Goddamn it, we've lost her.

01:20:22.276 --> 01:20:23.610
Why don't we have
that air force jet

01:20:23.694 --> 01:20:25.570
try his frequency
again just in case?

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:28.072
Even if we can't hear her,
there's a chance
she can hear us.

01:20:28.157 --> 01:20:30.450
l'm gonna talk her
through her climb just on
the assumption she can.

01:20:30.534 --> 01:20:32.660
409, do you read?

01:20:32.745 --> 01:20:35.788
They found the small plane.
lt exploded on impact.

01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:44.297
The radio's dead.

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.726
We're all
alone now, Bette.

01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:21.876
The winch will hold
your position, okay?

01:21:21.961 --> 01:21:22.961
You got it, sir?

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:24.045
Got it.

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:27.757
You'll find you can control
lateral movement somewhat.

01:21:27.841 --> 01:21:30.718
Using the wind pressure
against my body.

01:21:30.803 --> 01:21:33.846
You'll have to signal us
for in-and-out movement.

01:21:35.432 --> 01:21:38.560
l must've made 20
drops in Nam, sir.

01:21:38.644 --> 01:21:41.938
But what you're gonna do
scares the hell out of me.

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:44.315
Me too.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.417
Nancy.

01:22:02.501 --> 01:22:03.835
Oh, my God !

01:22:05.838 --> 01:22:08.965
Bette, we're too low!

01:22:13.262 --> 01:22:15.471
What are you supposed to do?

01:22:18.267 --> 01:22:19.809
l don't know.

01:22:22.396 --> 01:22:24.897
l know they worried
about airspeed.

01:22:25.691 --> 01:22:26.858
Now. . .

01:22:28.402 --> 01:22:30.028
lf we climb,

01:22:32.072 --> 01:22:33.823
the airspeed drops.

01:22:34.908 --> 01:22:36.784
l could stall us out.

01:22:42.207 --> 01:22:43.625
The captain !

01:22:44.418 --> 01:22:46.461
He said he could help us!

01:22:52.217 --> 01:22:53.718
BETTE: Do you
understand me, Captain?

01:22:57.598 --> 01:22:59.223
Thrust levers.

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.227
Thrust levers.
What about them?

01:23:07.316 --> 01:23:10.568
Forward, an inch.

01:23:13.113 --> 01:23:15.365
All right. Anything else?

01:23:16.909 --> 01:23:18.993
(GASPlNG) 190. Hold.

01:23:21.664 --> 01:23:25.625
1 -9-0. . .

01:23:27.503 --> 01:23:28.836
Airspeed.

01:23:49.775 --> 01:23:52.026
l've done a few screwy
things in this outfit,

01:23:52.152 --> 01:23:54.362
but this'll be
a first, huh, Gage?

01:23:54.446 --> 01:23:57.865
She'll handle a lot
like that 707 tanker
you're used to flying.

01:23:57.950 --> 01:23:59.701
But just remember,
once you get
her on the ground,

01:23:59.785 --> 01:24:02.704
you're still three
stories in the air.

01:24:02.788 --> 01:24:04.497
l'll let you know
if it's true about

01:24:04.581 --> 01:24:07.208
not being able to make
a bad landing in a 747.

01:24:07.292 --> 01:24:09.502
Control reports 409
has lost radio contact.

01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:12.171
Altitude.
What about the altitude?

01:24:12.256 --> 01:24:13.548
Had they made corrections?

01:24:13.632 --> 01:24:14.882
Negative.

01:24:14.967 --> 01:24:16.509
What's our ETA at rendezvous?

01:24:16.593 --> 01:24:18.052
Few minutes.

01:24:18.137 --> 01:24:20.346
They haven't
got a few minutes!

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:49.417
ALEXANDER: We oughta
be able to see her soon.

01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:52.336
Probably be below us.
Be harder to see.

01:24:52.421 --> 01:24:54.422
MOSS: Two minutes to ETA.

01:24:54.506 --> 01:24:57.008
She's gotta be
out there somewhere.

01:25:25.078 --> 01:25:26.287
There she is.

01:25:30.793 --> 01:25:33.628
She's flying it!
She's flying it herself!

01:25:35.047 --> 01:25:38.174
Climb, baby. Climb.

01:25:41.386 --> 01:25:44.055
The mountains. We're so close!

01:27:38.503 --> 01:27:40.004
Ready, sir?

01:27:47.387 --> 01:27:48.846
l'll see you in Salt Lake.
