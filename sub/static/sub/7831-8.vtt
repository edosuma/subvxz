12:01.153 --> 12:05.647
<i>Excuse me. I took a piece</i>
<i>of the skeleton for scientific analysis.</i>

12:05.758 --> 12:08.989
- Soon we'll have all the facts.
- You did what?

12:09.095 --> 12:11.063
- You know what? I don't like that.
- [Scoffs]

12:11.163 --> 12:13.791
Facts are meaningless.
You can use facts to prove anything...

12:13.899 --> 12:16.026
that's even remotely true.

12:16.135 --> 12:18.103
- Facts, schmacts.
- [Panting]

12:18.204 --> 12:22.265
Ah, here's Dr. Gould now.
What were the results, Professor?

12:22.374 --> 12:25.343
- Inconclusive.
- "Inconclusive"?

12:25.444 --> 12:27.503
Then why'd you come
running up like that?

12:28.914 --> 12:31.610
Can I use your bathroom?
[Groans]

12:31.717 --> 12:36.086
Well, it appears <i>science</i>
has faltered once again...

12:36.188 --> 12:39.419
in the face of overwhelming
religious evidence.

12:39.525 --> 12:41.789
- But-
- Go home, science girl.

12:41.894 --> 12:43.953
- I <i>am</i> home.
- Good. Stay there.

12:44.063 --> 12:47.260
Okay, folks.
Get your "Angel Glow Sticks."

12:47.366 --> 12:50.699
- No one gets into heaven without a glow stick.
- I'll take four.

12:51.904 --> 12:55.032
Ach! Those morons make me so angry.

12:55.141 --> 12:58.338
Maybe so. But I'd appreciate it
if you didn't call them morons.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.537
But they <i>are</i> morons.

13:00.646 --> 13:03.547
- What grown person could believe in angels?
- Well...

13:03.649 --> 13:05.583
your mother, for one.

13:05.684 --> 13:08.209
You?

13:08.320 --> 13:12.086
- But, y-you're an intelligent person, Mom.
- [Pot Clanks]

13:12.191 --> 13:15.160
There has to be more to life
than just what we see, Lisa.

13:15.261 --> 13:17.525
Everyone needs something
to believe in.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.292
It's not that I don't have
a spiritual side.

13:20.399 --> 13:24.495
I just find it hard to believe there's
a dead angel hanging in our garage.

13:24.603 --> 13:27.436
Hmmm. My poor Lisa.

13:27.540 --> 13:30.270
If you can't make a leap
of faith now and then...

13:30.376 --> 13:33.038
well, I feel sorry for you.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.739
Don't feel sorry for me, Mom.

[Kent Brockman] Next on <i>Smartline,</i>
the Springfield angel controversy.

13:42.121 --> 13:44.851
Our guest tonight, making her
13th appearance on <i>Smartline...</i>

13:44.957 --> 13:47.585
- Miss Lisa Simpson.
- Kent.

13:47.693 --> 13:50.491
Miss Simpson, how can you
maintain your skepticism...

13:50.596 --> 13:53.724
in spite of the fact this thing really,
really looks like an angel?

13:53.833 --> 13:55.767
I just think it's a fantasy.

13:55.868 --> 13:59.565
If you believe in angels, then why not
unicorns or sea monsters or leprechauns?

13:59.672 --> 14:00.906
Oh, that's a bunch of baloney, Lisa!

14:00.906 --> 14:01.338
Oh, that's a bunch of baloney, Lisa!

14:07.479 --> 14:09.845
Everyone knows
leprechauns are extinct.

14:09.949 --> 14:11.416
Look, you can either accept science
and face reality...

14:11.517 --> 14:13.917
or you can believe in angels
and live in a childish dreamworld.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.884
Science-
What's science ever done for us?

14:15.988 --> 14:17.979
- TV off.
- Science is like a blabbermouth...

14:18.090 --> 14:20.581
who ruins a movie
by telling you how it ends.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.218
Well, I say there are some things we don't
wanna know- important things.

14:23.329 --> 14:26.355
- [Barney] Yeah, he's right!
- Enough talk.

14:26.465 --> 14:28.365

[Groans]

14:41.680 --> 14:43.807
Oh! I'm paralyzed.

14:43.916 --> 14:46.077
I just hope medical science
can cure me.

14:46.185 --> 14:49.018
[Commotion Continues]

14:51.023 --> 14:53.924
Why? Why was I programmed
to feel pain?

14:54.026 --> 14:56.722
Technocrats are learning
a lesson in humility tonight...

14:56.829 --> 15:02.096
as angel supporters lay waste
to Springfield's scientific institutions.

15:02.201 --> 15:05.136
Ugh! I wish I'd never found
those stupid bones!

15:05.237 --> 15:07.330
It's time to put an end to this.

15:07.439 --> 15:10.636
- Bart, I'm borrowing your blue crowbar.
- Good ol' Blue-y.

15:10.743 --> 15:14.372
- Hey, she's gonna smash the angel!
- Somebody stop her!

15:16.916 --> 15:20.477
[Gasps]
It's gone!

15:20.586 --> 15:23.919
[Weeping]
Oh, no! This can't be happening!

15:24.023 --> 15:28.084
What the hell are we gonna do with
10,000 angel ashtrays? [Sobbing]

15:28.193 --> 15:30.161
- I could take up smoking.
- You damn well better.

15:34.366 --> 15:37.802
Okay. Okay, don't panic.
Marge, stop panicking!

15:37.903 --> 15:40.030
We need a replacement skeleton,
and we need it now.

15:40.139 --> 15:42.937
- Bart, strip down to your skeleton.
- <i>[Door Opening]</i>

15:44.677 --> 15:47.942
We've come for the angel, Homer.
It's not safe with the unbeliever.

15:48.047 --> 15:50.174
It's gone!
We're too late.

15:50.282 --> 15:53.080
Little girl, what have you done
with our precious angel?

15:53.185 --> 15:55.585
Nothing!
Someone must have stolen it.

15:55.688 --> 16:00.625
Looks to me like Lisa Simpson found
something science couldn't explain...

16:00.726 --> 16:02.785
so she had to destroy it.

16:02.895 --> 16:05.955
Well, that's all the evidence I need.
Arrest the girl.

16:06.065 --> 16:09.466
- [Gasps] Hey!
- What? She didn't do anything.

16:09.568 --> 16:12.196
Give her a nice cell-
something in "C" Block.

16:13.772 --> 16:16.206
<i>Lisa Simpson, you are charged...</i>

16:16.308 --> 16:19.869
with destruction of an historic curiosity-
a misdemeanor.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.813
But in a larger sense, this trial
will settle the age-old question...

16:23.916 --> 16:26.009
of science versus religion.

16:26.118 --> 16:28.086
Let the opening statements commence.

16:28.187 --> 16:31.554
Your Honor,
over the coming weeks and months...

16:31.657 --> 16:34.922
we intend to prove Lisa Simpson
willfully destroyed-

[Shouting, Chattering]

16:45.504 --> 16:47.938
I find the defendant not guilty.

16:48.040 --> 16:51.237
As for <i>Science versus Religion,</i>
I'm issuing a restraining order.

16:51.343 --> 16:55.279
Religion must stay 500 yards
from Science at all times.

16:55.381 --> 16:57.713
[Chattering Continues]

17:00.052 --> 17:02.953
Wow! Do you think it flew up here?

17:03.055 --> 17:06.491
- Well, it didn't ride up on no zebra.
- Look, a message!

17:06.592 --> 17:09.789
[Homer]
"The end will come at sundown."

17:09.895 --> 17:11.988
[Laughing]
Hey-

17:12.097 --> 17:14.656
Wait a second.
I don't like the sound of that.

17:14.767 --> 17:18.567
I'm scared, Daddy. Too scared
to even wet my pants.

17:18.670 --> 17:21.502
It's okay, Son.
Just relax, and it'll come.

17:21.607 --> 17:25.976
Even Lisa Simpson must now agree.
We have witnessed a miracle.

17:26.078 --> 17:28.638
Hardly.
Anyone could've written that.

17:28.747 --> 17:32.012
Oh, angel, listen not
to this child of Satan.

17:32.117 --> 17:36.247
Reverend, I've got to admit. This doomsday
warning has me just a smidge twitterpated.

17:36.355 --> 17:38.846
Oh, now, be calm, Ned.

17:38.957 --> 17:42.449
But be afraid also-
tremendously afraid-

17:42.561 --> 17:44.961
for the day of reckoning is upon us!

17:45.064 --> 17:48.261
- [Gasping, Murmuring]
- Reckoning?

17:53.972 --> 17:57.169
Your Holiness,
there is word from America.

17:57.276 --> 18:00.302
They say an angel
has foretold the apocalypse.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.403
Um, keep an eye on it.

18:09.321 --> 18:12.449
Oh, Edna, my sweet buttercup,
you read my mind.

18:12.558 --> 18:15.891
Just, uh, give me 20 minutes
or so to finish these tardy slips.

18:17.362 --> 18:19.796
Why we gettir dressed-up, Mom?
Are we going to Black Angus?

18:19.898 --> 18:25.495
Well, you might say we're going
to the best steakhouse in the whole universe.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.799
So we're not going to Black Angus.

18:28.907 --> 18:31.102
Will you leave me <i>alone?</i>

18:31.210 --> 18:34.577
It's bad enough you're making me go
to your stupid Judgment Day.

18:34.680 --> 18:39.276
Please, Lisa.
I don't know exactly what's gonna happen.

18:39.384 --> 18:42.649
But I really wish we could
make peace before sunset.

18:42.754 --> 18:44.984

Uh, "Nearer, My God, to Thee" maybe?

18:59.805 --> 19:03.673
- Or-Or-Or-Or "Amazing Grace"?
- Mmm. Nah.

19:03.775 --> 19:07.734
Oh, Marge.
Don't let go, no matter what.
