00:23.792 --> 00:26.792
I always said the only thing my
daughter would be on time for...

00:27.501 --> 00:28.501
...is her own wedding.

00:31.709 --> 00:32.709
I guess I was wrong.

00:34.792 --> 00:35.792
Uh Paula.

00:36.250 --> 00:37.290
You think you two could...

00:37.584 --> 00:40.501
Play something for these
very patient folks?

00:42.334 --> 00:43.959
Pretty sure that's
something we can do.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.709
For Pete's sake.
Nothing's even happened yet.

01:01.125 --> 01:02.792
I know, I know.

01:02.918 --> 01:03.669
It's just...

01:03.834 --> 01:06.626
I thought about how beautiful
it's going to be and I lost it.

01:08.501 --> 01:10.127
Be more beautiful with flowers.

01:17.834 --> 01:20.292
No, no, I didn't
mix up the dates.

01:20.918 --> 01:25.083
I'm just dropping the bouquet
at the bride's house now.

01:25.834 --> 01:27.542
I got stuck behind Mr. Withers.

01:28.042 --> 01:29.458
You know... We really should
politely mention to him

01:29.459 --> 01:31.793
that it might be time
for him to hand in his -

01:34.792 --> 01:37.001
No. No way they bought that.

01:42.250 --> 01:43.250
Gabe?

01:44.375 --> 01:45.375
Gabe?

01:50.876 --> 01:53.417
Gabe! C'mon I'm late
enough as it is.

01:53.709 --> 01:54.709
Come here baby.

01:55.584 --> 01:56.584
Hi!!

01:57.292 --> 01:59.334
What do you say Gabe?
Want to get married today?

02:00.042 --> 02:02.918
Me too! Now where did
you hide those rings?

02:07.042 --> 02:08.249
Want to take a bet on...

02:08.250 --> 02:11.209
Who's calling to yell
at me for being late?

02:57.876 --> 03:01.999
Alright, Gabe. Dad says this is as
fashionably late as I am allowed to...

03:28.334 --> 03:30.626
It's Tara. You knew she was
going to be a little late.

03:31.417 --> 03:32.834
Yeah... yeah.

03:38.626 --> 03:41.377
Hey! I thought it was
always bad luck to...

03:46.083 --> 03:47.250
Yeah, yeah. I'm on my way.

03:49.375 --> 03:50.375
What's wrong?

03:52.959 --> 03:54.501
Gabe got hit by a car.

03:56.250 --> 03:57.250
Oh no.

04:16.291 --> 04:17.291
Hey.

04:18.834 --> 04:19.834
How is he?

04:20.375 --> 04:21.454
I don't know what happened.

04:22.501 --> 04:24.301
I was just trying to get
the rings from him...

04:24.542 --> 04:28.542
And then dad called and I knew
I was late already, and I just...

04:28.709 --> 04:29.834
It's okay. It's okay.

04:41.876 --> 04:42.876
How is he, Doc?

04:45.417 --> 04:48.001
He's taken a substantial
amount of damage.

04:50.626 --> 04:51.709
I can operate

04:51.959 --> 04:54.835
see if I can reduce some of
the swelling on his brain.

04:55.876 --> 04:56.876
Whatever it takes.

04:57.334 --> 04:59.668
Unfortunately, it's not cheap.

05:01.042 --> 05:02.334
It's not my labor mind you...

05:02.918 --> 05:05.669
Medicine, the procedure itself.

05:06.083 --> 05:08.292
We don't care.
Anything.

05:14.959 --> 05:15.959
Um...

05:18.209 --> 05:20.751
I'm happy to help with the
costs if you need it...

05:22.626 --> 05:24.293
I think you've done
enough already.

06:02.209 --> 06:06.501
I'm truly sorry. We did
everything we could.

06:34.918 --> 06:37.125
Oh wow, this is
nice on the paws.

06:40.834 --> 06:41.834
Hey, I can talk!

06:42.167 --> 06:44.334
Pardon me.
Hello?

06:44.542 --> 06:45.667
Yes you!

06:46.834 --> 06:50.501
Yeah, we're looking over here now.
Ahhh, who's a good boy?

07:00.709 --> 07:03.374
Excuse me, I was wondering
if you could tell me how

07:03.375 --> 07:04.709
to get to the church from here?

07:04.918 --> 07:06.043
I'm late for a wedding.

07:06.834 --> 07:07.958
Ya sure, no problem.

07:07.959 --> 07:11.585
All you got to do is go back and
take a left at No Chance Avenue.

07:11.792 --> 07:13.584
- Name?
- Gabriel.

07:14.083 --> 07:16.292
What are you talking
about No Chance Avenue?

07:17.167 --> 07:18.250
What is this place?

07:18.667 --> 07:19.959
Well, let's see.

07:20.083 --> 07:23.333
You're walking on a cloud
and listening to harps.

07:23.876 --> 07:25.752
Are you honestly
not getting this?

07:25.959 --> 07:26.959
What?

07:26.960 --> 07:28.418
No, that can't be right.

07:28.751 --> 07:30.460
I'm going to my
family's wedding.

07:31.584 --> 07:35.001
I saw a squirrel. And I chased
him out to the front and...

07:36.626 --> 07:37.668
Oh no.

07:38.292 --> 07:40.375
Ahh, it's always the squirrels.

07:40.584 --> 07:42.416
Now, if you'll kindly sign here

07:42.417 --> 07:44.666
we'll get you sitting on a couch
you can never get kicked off of.

07:44.667 --> 07:45.750
How does that sound?

07:45.751 --> 07:48.627
I can't! I have to get back there!
They need me.

07:50.292 --> 07:53.750
Ya I feel for you, I do.
But it's not how this works.

07:53.751 --> 07:55.708
Head on through, I promise
you're going to love it.

07:55.709 --> 07:58.084
Hey. Excuse me? I think
I might be lost?

07:58.375 --> 08:00.917
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, no,
no, no, no you can't be here!

08:02.709 --> 08:04.084
Squirrel!

08:04.417 --> 08:05.417
Oh no.

08:09.417 --> 08:12.335
Hey, hey, ya I need
some paws down here!

08:12.959 --> 08:14.168
Ya, it's happening again!

08:21.375 --> 08:22.834
I'm coming home guys!

08:29.501 --> 08:31.085
Hey guys.
I'm back!

08:41.626 --> 08:42.667
Look who's home!

08:46.667 --> 08:48.417
Oh ya I can talk now.

08:49.542 --> 08:50.959
Have you seen my tie?

08:55.292 --> 08:56.292
Don't be mad.

09:05.125 --> 09:06.125
You ready?

09:08.959 --> 09:10.001
Hey Pete!

09:10.375 --> 09:11.709
Can I sit with you up front?

09:15.292 --> 09:17.292
Or in back.
The back's fine too!

09:17.709 --> 09:19.335
I'm just happy I didn't miss it!

09:28.209 --> 09:30.918
Hey, guys, where are you going?

09:31.083 --> 09:33.292
The car's out front.
You... Ah...

09:39.292 --> 09:40.875
I keep opening the fridge door

09:40.876 --> 09:44.876
and expecting him to knock
me over and steal a hot dog.

09:48.250 --> 09:49.876
I can't believe it's
been over a month.

09:52.042 --> 09:53.084
A month?

09:54.334 --> 09:57.168
We were going to go on our
honeymoon today, Gabe.

09:59.375 --> 10:00.625
You would have loved it.

10:01.667 --> 10:04.667
We found a place with a
beach just for dogs.

10:06.876 --> 10:08.000
We miss you Gabe.

10:16.626 --> 10:18.292
They didn't get married.

10:18.792 --> 10:21.418
Hey! The rings are right here.
Look!

10:25.083 --> 10:26.083
I'm sorry.

10:29.667 --> 10:30.667
Alright.

10:30.792 --> 10:33.751
A hundred and thirty five, a
hundred and thirty six...

10:33.959 --> 10:35.418
A hundred and thirty seven.

10:35.709 --> 10:36.249
Hey!

10:36.250 --> 10:39.333
Remind me to ask the boss what
the purpose of squirrels are.

10:39.667 --> 10:40.667
Squirrel?!

10:40.918 --> 10:42.293
What? No, I was...

10:42.709 --> 10:43.751
Nevermind.

10:43.876 --> 10:46.043
You just go on through.
Chase them all you want.

10:46.834 --> 10:51.626
A hundred and thirty eight.
Wait... Who's missing?

10:53.167 --> 10:55.209
Gabriel?
Which one is...

10:56.709 --> 10:58.585
Huh! Oh no.

11:00.375 --> 11:03.417
Hey, I need, uh, someone
to cover my shifts.

11:03.584 --> 11:05.418
One of the new
arrivals went for...

11:05.584 --> 11:07.043
You lost another one?

11:07.501 --> 11:10.043
No! And if anyone
asks, it's a walk.

11:11.042 --> 11:12.042
Who goes back??

11:12.459 --> 11:16.584
Honestly - mountains of treats,
no baths, no fleas. C'mon.

11:26.417 --> 11:27.584
Clothes...

11:28.667 --> 11:30.751
Alright Gabe, where did you go?

11:47.375 --> 11:50.251
It's alright.
It's not the one I'm looking for.

12:24.501 --> 12:25.626
Hey dad.

12:27.792 --> 12:29.293
Tax season already?

12:30.792 --> 12:32.167
Actually, I wish.

12:32.792 --> 12:35.500
Just trying to figure out which
vet bill gets paid this month

12:35.501 --> 12:37.043
and which ones can wait.

12:38.209 --> 12:40.250
Why don't you guys
let me help you out?

12:41.626 --> 12:44.250
Really. I have a
little socked away...

12:44.417 --> 12:47.000
Thanks, but we're fine.

12:47.834 --> 12:50.292
Besides, you've
already done so much.

12:52.584 --> 12:53.584
You know...

12:54.667 --> 12:57.001
If this is just about
getting married...

12:59.000 --> 13:00.667
You don't need a fancy wedding.

13:02.125 --> 13:03.751
I can marry you guys right here.

13:06.334 --> 13:07.417
I appreciate it.

13:09.626 --> 13:11.417
But we want to wait until
we can do it right.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.417
We want everyone to be there.

13:18.834 --> 13:20.083
Missed you at church.

13:27.334 --> 13:28.959
We just need a
little bit of time.

13:29.501 --> 13:31.417
Oh ya, ya no rush.

13:32.292 --> 13:33.292
Just, uh...

13:35.375 --> 13:37.500
Letting you know we, uh...

13:39.584 --> 13:40.792
We all missed you.

13:43.834 --> 13:44.876
I appreciate it.

13:53.375 --> 13:54.417
Hello?

13:55.959 --> 13:57.959
Um yeah.
Can you hold on a second?

14:04.876 --> 14:05.918
Sorry about that.

14:06.667 --> 14:08.667
Yes, the dress still
is available.

14:09.501 --> 14:13.668
No, nothing wrong with it,
just, umm... never used it.

14:14.918 --> 14:16.335
Don't sell the dress.

14:16.834 --> 14:18.876
Sure. Five o'clock sounds great.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.501
I'll give you my address.
Do you have a pen?

14:22.959 --> 14:24.501
I got to do something.

14:57.959 --> 14:59.501
Morning, Mrs. Jeffries.

15:01.792 --> 15:04.167
I'm fine.
Thanks for asking.

15:10.375 --> 15:11.375
Hey mom.

15:12.125 --> 15:13.959
Yup!
Couldn't be better!

15:14.125 --> 15:16.124
Everyone in town hates me
which means I probably

15:16.125 --> 15:19.084
moved back to town just to run
your business into the ground!

15:20.542 --> 15:21.667
Overreacting?

15:23.417 --> 15:24.459
You could be right but...

15:24.667 --> 15:26.709
Excuse me, Mr. Culligan!

15:27.334 --> 15:29.168
My mother's looking
for a second opinion.

15:29.501 --> 15:32.209
Would you mind telling her how
everyone in town can't stand me?

15:35.667 --> 15:36.709
Thank you!

15:38.751 --> 15:39.793
Hey mom.

15:40.375 --> 15:42.249
Yep, I got to go
deliver these flowers

15:42.250 --> 15:44.417
to the only person in town
still taking our business.

15:45.834 --> 15:47.001
I love you too.

15:48.250 --> 15:49.292
Enjoy the Grand Canyon.

15:55.542 --> 15:56.792
Morning, Norma.

15:57.083 --> 15:59.125
Jerry.
Late again I see.

15:59.834 --> 16:02.335
Sorry.
I got a flat.

16:03.459 --> 16:06.085
I was trying to flag someone
down to lend me a hand.

16:06.209 --> 16:08.459
But people don't seem too
eager to help me these days.

16:08.834 --> 16:10.917
Well, we all really
liked that dog.

16:12.667 --> 16:14.918
Always appreciated your
honesty there Norma.

16:15.459 --> 16:17.542
And while we're on the subject.

16:18.792 --> 16:20.500
I just want to say thanks...

16:20.501 --> 16:22.751
For continuing to use
me for your flowers.

16:26.459 --> 16:28.083
You sticking by
me during this...

16:29.792 --> 16:32.375
That is to say, it
really means a lot.

16:33.042 --> 16:34.209
I promised your mother.

16:35.918 --> 16:37.000
Is that the only reason?

16:37.918 --> 16:38.918
Yep.

16:41.876 --> 16:43.043
Next week then?

16:44.626 --> 16:45.793
Try to be on time Jerry.

16:46.542 --> 16:47.542
I will.

16:53.167 --> 16:54.626
Mr. Jeffries!

16:56.959 --> 16:58.834
Mr. Culligan!

17:01.000 --> 17:02.209
This is useless...

17:03.667 --> 17:05.083
Hey! There's Jerry!

17:05.375 --> 17:07.834
Thanks for hitting me, and
messing up my family!

17:08.334 --> 17:10.751
Maybe don't run into the
middle of busy roads?

17:12.834 --> 17:14.334
Did you just talk to me?!

17:14.751 --> 17:15.876
You can see me?

17:16.291 --> 17:17.291
Seeing you

17:17.292 --> 17:19.834
isn't the biggest problem I'm
having right now, although

17:20.334 --> 17:22.542
that is also troubling.

17:22.917 --> 17:25.544
This is perfect!
You can help me throw the wedding!!

17:27.834 --> 17:31.585
I honestly have no idea
how to react to this.

17:32.334 --> 17:33.500
It's fine!

17:33.501 --> 17:37.043
See I was up there, and He said
to go through. But how could I?

17:37.584 --> 17:39.168
I didn't want to
miss the wedding.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.918
Then I come down and found
out it didn't even happen.

17:42.292 --> 17:44.375
But it's okay because
you can hear me.

17:44.584 --> 17:46.584
So now you and me can fix this!

17:48.584 --> 17:49.792
Isn't that great?!

17:51.250 --> 17:52.334
What are you doing?

17:53.501 --> 17:55.209
I'm looking up
psychotic episodes.

17:55.459 --> 17:57.334
Specific to dog hallucinations.

17:57.751 --> 17:59.209
You're not hallucinating!

17:59.459 --> 18:01.417
Look, I don't know
how to explain it.

18:01.626 --> 18:04.127
But there's obviously a
reason I can talk to you.

18:06.167 --> 18:07.167
Obviously.

18:07.542 --> 18:09.458
If you're the
only one who can see me

18:09.459 --> 18:11.251
that must mean something.

18:11.459 --> 18:15.418
Even if I did believe
this, which I don't.

18:17.292 --> 18:18.292
Why would...

18:20.209 --> 18:21.334
want me to help?

18:21.542 --> 18:22.875
I think I'm the last person

18:22.876 --> 18:24.835
Pete and Tara want to help
put their wedding on.

18:25.459 --> 18:27.417
Mysterious ways, my friend!

18:27.876 --> 18:31.334
As of right now, you and me,
we're in this together.

18:32.167 --> 18:33.417
No, we really aren't.

18:33.751 --> 18:37.459
I'm just imagining you because I
feel guilty. That's all this is.

18:38.209 --> 18:39.918
Jerry, you know
you're gonna help.

18:40.125 --> 18:42.042
Say yes. Come on. Be with me.

18:43.542 --> 18:48.584
You can ask me a million times,
and the answer will still be no.

18:48.751 --> 18:50.334
Just say yes.

18:50.918 --> 18:52.585
- Say yes.
- No.

18:52.751 --> 18:54.543
- Say yes.
- Uh, uh.

18:54.876 --> 18:55.918
Say yes.

18:58.250 --> 18:59.250
No.

18:59.709 --> 19:00.876
Just say yes.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.041
No.

19:02.042 --> 19:03.292
Say it.
Say yes.

19:03.751 --> 19:06.210
How about no.

19:06.459 --> 19:07.459
Say yes.

19:08.167 --> 19:10.126
Leave me alone!

19:10.284 --> 19:12.576
Okay, as soon as you say yes.

19:12.834 --> 19:17.626
Just say yes.
Or I'm going to bug you all night.

19:18.083 --> 19:19.834
- Say yes.
- No.

19:20.417 --> 19:22.542
And when my brother saw
that truck under the tree...

19:22.751 --> 19:24.252
- Say yes.
- No.

19:24.709 --> 19:26.335
The look in his eyes...

19:26.626 --> 19:28.127
- Say yes.
- No.

19:28.459 --> 19:29.459
Say yes.

19:29.959 --> 19:31.084
Fine!

19:37.375 --> 19:38.458
Everything okay, Jerry?

19:40.417 --> 19:43.334
I do not suggest you say
you were talking to me.

19:43.834 --> 19:44.834
Yea...

19:46.334 --> 19:47.751
I was just saying...

19:49.667 --> 19:50.667
Fine.

19:52.584 --> 19:59.000
You know, like this was a
fine sermon today, there Rev.

19:59.375 --> 20:00.375
Nice save.

20:01.709 --> 20:02.709
May I?

20:05.959 --> 20:08.751
Now, I knew how much my
brother loved that truck.

20:09.751 --> 20:11.751
So when curiosity got
the better of me...

20:12.083 --> 20:15.751
And I broke it, I knew I
had really messed up.

20:17.375 --> 20:21.334
Now here I am trying everything
I can to fix this thing.

20:21.834 --> 20:26.209
I'm using tape, I'm using
glue, I'm using bubble gum.

20:27.250 --> 20:30.459
But it wasn't until I admitted
that I needed help...

20:30.667 --> 20:32.792
That that truck got fixed.

20:33.709 --> 20:35.083
So are you going to help?

20:35.584 --> 20:36.584
Quiet.

20:37.042 --> 20:38.084
I want to hear this.

20:39.042 --> 20:41.376
My dad, he fixed the wheels.

20:42.209 --> 20:45.418
My sister gave me a fancy
art glue. And mom...

20:45.667 --> 20:46.667
God bless her.

20:46.876 --> 20:51.502
Used a red nail polish to make
that thing look as good as new.

20:52.709 --> 20:54.709
And the moral of the
story people...

20:56.042 --> 20:57.876
It takes a village.

20:59.083 --> 21:00.959
I will see you all next Sunday.

21:03.083 --> 21:04.083
Wait.

21:04.959 --> 21:07.334
Jerry?
You have something to add?

21:08.125 --> 21:09.125
Um...

21:10.250 --> 21:14.375
Yes. Please.
If that's okay?

21:35.250 --> 21:36.250
Hi everyone.

21:38.334 --> 21:41.543
For those of you
who don't know me, I'm Jerry

21:42.417 --> 21:44.876
the guy who took over
my mom's greenhouse.

21:51.542 --> 21:54.208
Some of you may also know
me as the guy who ruined

21:54.209 --> 21:55.626
Pete and Tara's wedding last month.

21:55.834 --> 21:58.083
Ah... Oh...

22:02.834 --> 22:05.251
After listening to today's sermon

22:05.584 --> 22:07.958
I was wondering if you guys
might be able to help me

22:07.959 --> 22:09.668
fix the thing that I broke.

22:11.459 --> 22:14.251
Recently, I've been getting
a lot of pressure from

22:15.626 --> 22:19.418
someone to make things
right for Tara's wedding.

22:20.167 --> 22:21.167
So...

22:22.292 --> 22:24.084
I thought we could throw
them another one.

22:24.542 --> 22:26.667
But as a surprise.

22:26.792 --> 22:29.209
I don't know how open they'd
be to me doing this

22:29.501 --> 22:31.085
so I think a surprise might be best.

22:31.292 --> 22:34.501
Jerry, Jerry, that
is so kind of you...

22:35.083 --> 22:37.917
But a wedding is
extremely expensive.

22:38.083 --> 22:39.125
It is.

22:39.375 --> 22:41.293
Yes. And I one
hundred percent

22:41.417 --> 22:44.084
can't afford to throw
them one myself. But

22:44.876 --> 22:49.126
I thought maybe we
could all chip in

22:51.334 --> 22:52.334
and do it together.

22:53.542 --> 22:54.667
You know, like...

22:55.918 --> 22:56.918
As a village?

22:59.209 --> 23:00.334
Not bad, kid.

23:00.918 --> 23:02.627
Kindness is one thing Jerry

23:02.834 --> 23:04.791
but if I provide the food
for an entire wedding

23:04.792 --> 23:06.042
it will bankrupt me.

23:12.042 --> 23:14.959
What if I agreed to work for you
all in exchange for your help?

23:16.876 --> 23:20.417
I mean, I'm not exactly
swamped with work these days.

23:21.083 --> 23:25.875
So if I helped you at your
restaurant, or store, or whatever

23:25.876 --> 23:27.585
free of charge for
a couple of weeks,

23:27.876 --> 23:31.001
then, maybe you could supply
what's needed for the wedding?

23:32.751 --> 23:35.041
Well I suppose if I had
an extra pair of hands

23:35.042 --> 23:38.334
around the restaurant it might
be considered fair trade.

23:38.501 --> 23:39.501
There you go!

23:40.125 --> 23:43.375
We got food.
What else do we need for a wedding?

23:43.709 --> 23:46.668
Music?
Who's got music?

23:48.459 --> 23:49.584
Perfect!

23:50.584 --> 23:54.709
No idea what I can do for you,
but we'll figure something out.

23:56.042 --> 23:57.042
Who's next?

23:57.292 --> 23:58.584
Well, I'll be.

24:14.334 --> 24:15.376
Yes.

24:16.459 --> 24:19.542
Little girl with the very sticky
fingers touching my coat.

24:20.083 --> 24:21.083
I saw your dog.

24:21.292 --> 24:22.334
You did!!!

24:23.542 --> 24:24.667
Always the kids.

24:24.792 --> 24:26.152
That's great!
Where did you see it?

24:26.292 --> 24:27.292
Come with me.

24:27.792 --> 24:29.543
Oh you have no idea
how great this is.

24:29.709 --> 24:31.668
I am going to make
sure you get extra...

24:33.083 --> 24:35.834
Yes, that's him. Where
did you see him?

24:44.501 --> 24:45.501
You saw the poster.

24:46.125 --> 24:47.125
Yup!

24:50.000 --> 24:51.667
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

24:59.626 --> 25:01.960
Excuse me ma'am. I was
wondering if you could help me.

25:02.209 --> 25:05.710
I've lost my dog Scooty poops.

25:06.042 --> 25:07.918
And you know what, I
just I miss him so much.

25:08.375 --> 25:10.584
That looks like
Tara's dog, Gabe.

25:11.501 --> 25:13.792
Yeah, um, I heard about that.

25:13.918 --> 25:16.709
I was actually just about to go
over and give my condolences.

25:16.834 --> 25:17.834
To uhh...

25:18.918 --> 25:19.918
Tara.

25:20.042 --> 25:24.167
Tara, yes I am gonna go do that
right now. Okay, thank you!

25:40.542 --> 25:41.542
Sir...

25:43.083 --> 25:44.875
I'd like to start off by saying

25:44.876 --> 25:46.833
how sorry I am for interrupting
your sermon today.

25:46.834 --> 25:47.876
Stop.

25:49.042 --> 25:50.167
Stopping.

25:57.167 --> 25:58.334
I loved that dog.

26:00.250 --> 26:01.375
Yes sir.

26:03.292 --> 26:04.584
I imagine you did.

26:06.959 --> 26:09.918
And I don't think I could say
sorry enough to make it better.

26:13.417 --> 26:16.500
You think it's your
job to make it better?

26:19.334 --> 26:20.584
I don't know.

26:22.959 --> 26:25.667
A persistent little birdy
put the idea in my head.

26:27.584 --> 26:31.751
Well if you think you can get my Tara
and her Pete to come back to church

26:32.375 --> 26:33.959
you have my full support.

26:35.584 --> 26:36.667
Really?

26:38.459 --> 26:39.584
They're struggling.

26:40.501 --> 26:42.292
We all do sometimes.

26:44.542 --> 26:47.959
They're just not ready,
and I'm not pushing.

26:49.834 --> 26:51.167
I know the feeling.

26:53.876 --> 26:54.876
You know...

26:56.334 --> 27:00.584
I think what you're doing here,
is exactly what this town needs.

27:01.083 --> 27:02.959
A little community kindness.

27:03.501 --> 27:06.918
And I for one, am happy to
practice what I preach.

27:08.834 --> 27:10.292
That's great sir.

27:10.834 --> 27:12.042
Thank you.

27:12.459 --> 27:14.000
I'm going to go get started.

27:14.167 --> 27:16.333
I feel like there is going
to be a lot of work to do.

27:16.334 --> 27:19.208
Great. I'll see you tonight
at six at the soup kitchen.

27:19.209 --> 27:21.001
Yes sir you... ahh?

27:22.542 --> 27:23.958
Soup kitchen?

27:23.959 --> 27:26.750
Well you're going to need someone
to perform the ceremony,

27:26.751 --> 27:27.876
I assume.

27:28.000 --> 27:32.082
And an ounce of your time
helping those less fortunate

27:32.083 --> 27:35.625
is a fair exchange, don't you think?

27:36.667 --> 27:38.001
Couldn't agree more.

27:38.334 --> 27:39.543
See you at six.

27:49.459 --> 27:50.918
I think I caught most of that.

27:51.751 --> 27:54.417
It's hard to listen
through those doors.

27:54.709 --> 27:56.417
Did he ask you to make him soup?

27:56.959 --> 27:58.418
Couldn't you just walk through?

27:59.375 --> 28:01.251
Oh I didn't even think of that.

28:01.501 --> 28:04.002
See, you and me are gonna
be a good team, Jer!

28:05.417 --> 28:06.459
Please don't call me that.

28:06.834 --> 28:07.834
What, Jer??

28:08.042 --> 28:09.292
I can't call you Jer??

28:09.417 --> 28:10.124
No.

28:10.125 --> 28:11.125
No what?

28:12.876 --> 28:13.876
Oh.

28:14.584 --> 28:17.418
Ah... No, sorry.

28:17.584 --> 28:20.126
Nothing. I was just talking to

28:20.584 --> 28:21.626
myself.

28:22.083 --> 28:26.500
Which is something I do when I
want to feel embarrassed...

28:28.584 --> 28:29.584
You know what?

28:29.834 --> 28:31.043
I'm Jerry.

28:31.250 --> 28:32.792
Hi, I'm Shawna.

28:34.042 --> 28:35.459
It was nice to meet you.

28:35.709 --> 28:36.709
Thanks.

28:37.792 --> 28:39.042
Oh, hey, umm...

28:39.334 --> 28:40.750
Jerry, look if you need any help

28:40.751 --> 28:42.585
or anything just let me know.
Okay?

28:42.918 --> 28:44.502
That would be amazing...

28:45.125 --> 28:46.125
Uhh...

28:47.250 --> 28:48.459
Sha...

28:48.626 --> 28:49.918
Shawna.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.667
Have you ever talked
to a girl before?

28:54.209 --> 28:55.251
Okay, great.

28:55.959 --> 28:57.042
I'll keep that in mind.

28:58.501 --> 28:59.501
Thank you.

28:59.667 --> 29:01.626
Okay.
I'll see you later Jerry.

29:02.375 --> 29:07.167
Awww. She remembered yours.
That's got to make it even worse.

29:14.042 --> 29:17.041
So I'm thinking if we skip out
on birthday gifts this year

29:17.042 --> 29:19.376
that will be enough to get
us square with the vet bill.

29:19.501 --> 29:21.002
I'll make you a homemade gift again.

29:21.250 --> 29:23.917
Sure!
I need a new TV stand

29:23.918 --> 29:26.291
for the broke one you
gave me last year.

29:26.292 --> 29:27.791
Well someone just talked themselves

29:27.792 --> 29:29.041
out of a really uneven table.

29:29.042 --> 29:29.834
Hey Willow.

29:29.959 --> 29:32.168
Hi! You know, I was just thinking...

29:32.334 --> 29:35.293
Boy, I sure don't give
Tara enough hugs.

29:37.876 --> 29:39.959
Can never get too
many hugs I guess?

29:40.125 --> 29:43.125
Uh, we were just going to
grab some cof... coffee.

29:43.375 --> 29:44.625
Do you want to join us?

29:45.542 --> 29:48.251
Sorry. No time.
Can't. Gotta go!

29:55.959 --> 29:56.959
Hey Kevin.

29:57.417 --> 29:59.667
You will never guess what
just happened, Willow...

29:59.792 --> 30:01.209
Tell me your favourite color?

30:01.667 --> 30:02.750
Sorry?

30:02.751 --> 30:05.210
If you had to choose just one
between the both of you guys.

30:06.459 --> 30:08.001
Ummm... Ah...

30:09.083 --> 30:11.083
Pink.
I guess?

30:11.918 --> 30:12.918
Fair enough.

30:17.375 --> 30:19.375
Are we on a hidden camera show?

30:20.459 --> 30:22.834
Well, I'm not picking
my nose, just in case.

30:34.334 --> 30:35.833
Ah! You made it!

30:35.834 --> 30:37.042
Yes, sir.

30:37.334 --> 30:39.751
I figure this is as good
a place to start as any.

30:41.042 --> 30:44.083
So, what do I do?

30:44.667 --> 30:45.667
Follow me.

30:47.542 --> 30:49.459
Luckily, this should be
pretty easy for you.

30:50.417 --> 30:52.166
All you have to do
is stand back here

30:52.167 --> 30:53.876
and serve these nice folks in line.

30:55.167 --> 30:56.417
Think you can handle that?

30:57.083 --> 30:58.292
Seems easy enough.

31:00.125 --> 31:02.250
I'll fix him if he messes it up.

31:03.209 --> 31:04.209
Oh, ah...

31:05.125 --> 31:06.125
Hi.

31:07.042 --> 31:08.459
You volunteer here too!

31:08.959 --> 31:10.501
You going for sainthood?

31:11.334 --> 31:13.459
Some of us help just for
the sake of helping.

31:13.876 --> 31:15.041
Careful Jerry.

31:15.042 --> 31:16.876
You don't want both my
daughters mad at you.

31:19.417 --> 31:20.417
Both?

31:22.334 --> 31:25.543
That means your...
Tara's sister.

31:25.834 --> 31:27.335
Yeah, for my whole life now.

31:30.876 --> 31:32.667
I take it you hate me then too?

31:33.584 --> 31:36.792
No, hate is not something
I let get a hold of me.

31:37.209 --> 31:38.209
Hey.

31:39.334 --> 31:41.000
Hey Carrie, how are you?

31:41.542 --> 31:43.417
Be a lot better if I
could find some work.

31:44.167 --> 31:46.584
You know what, I'm sure
something will come up. Promise.

31:52.876 --> 31:55.250
I didn't know so many
people in town needed help.

31:56.209 --> 31:59.125
Yeah, sadly there's always lots
of people who need help, right.

32:01.542 --> 32:02.709
Let's at least do our part.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.042
What did you think?

32:25.042 --> 32:28.375
That was actually a lot of fun.

32:30.334 --> 32:32.626
Hopefully the rest of
plan goes as smooth.

32:37.334 --> 32:38.584
Well you did a good job.

32:39.292 --> 32:41.166
Any time you want to
come down and help out,

32:41.167 --> 32:42.917
we'd be glad to have you.

32:42.918 --> 32:44.377
I think I just might.

32:46.125 --> 32:48.375
Well thanks and
you're good to go.

32:48.751 --> 32:49.960
You sure?

32:57.125 --> 32:58.751
Does that mean you'll
do the wedding?

32:59.626 --> 33:01.167
She's my daughter Jerry.

33:01.459 --> 33:02.751
I was always going to do it.

33:04.125 --> 33:05.167
Take care.

33:07.209 --> 33:08.209
Night Jerry.

33:09.834 --> 33:10.834
Night...

33:11.459 --> 33:12.501
Shawna.

33:16.459 --> 33:19.333
This is not...
How does anything fit in here?

33:19.334 --> 33:21.082
I can barely get my head in.

33:21.083 --> 33:23.333
Give me a sec.
I just want to water the flowers.

33:24.209 --> 33:25.376
Oh.

33:27.083 --> 33:28.333
That's definitely him.

33:28.459 --> 33:30.377
Okay. Alright... Ummm.

33:31.918 --> 33:32.918
Okay.

33:35.167 --> 33:36.167
Okay.

33:36.501 --> 33:37.584
Under here.

33:38.667 --> 33:40.292
This so much harder
without paws!

33:43.751 --> 33:44.960
Ah! I'm a cat!

33:45.501 --> 33:47.377
Up the tree!
Be like a cat.

33:47.751 --> 33:50.043
Fat cat!
Very fat cat!

33:54.125 --> 33:55.917
You will not look up here.

33:55.918 --> 33:59.168
You will not look up here.
There is nothing to see.

34:02.584 --> 34:03.792
Oh, I am so heavy.

34:17.918 --> 34:19.000
How do I get down?

34:32.626 --> 34:35.127
Hey! So I've got
tomorrow all planned.

34:35.250 --> 34:37.708
We'll start by getting
the jukebox for Norma.

34:37.833 --> 34:39.376
And then make our rounds.

34:39.583 --> 34:42.667
I'll navigate and I get to
control the radio.

34:43.708 --> 34:45.251
How'd the soup kitchen go?

34:45.583 --> 34:47.833
You didn't think that
Shawna being Tara's sister

34:47.833 --> 34:49.251
was worth mentioning?

34:49.751 --> 34:51.918
It never came up.
Why does that matter?

34:52.167 --> 34:53.167
What?

34:53.792 --> 34:54.792
It doesn't.

34:55.501 --> 34:58.293
Just saying, it would
have been nice to know.

34:58.876 --> 35:01.001
Awww!
Somebody's got a crush!

35:01.584 --> 35:04.251
Enough of that.
Get up.

35:04.709 --> 35:08.126
Why? Tara and Pete always
let me sleep on the bed.

35:10.542 --> 35:13.334
Fine. But...
Stay on your side.

35:14.417 --> 35:16.168
Can I be the little spoon?

35:16.542 --> 35:19.501
My paw falls asleep
if I'm the big spoon.

35:19.959 --> 35:21.542
No spoons.

35:23.375 --> 35:24.375
Go to bed.

35:38.918 --> 35:41.041
We're just about ready to
close so if you want food...

35:41.042 --> 35:42.709
You're have to order
it right away.

35:44.250 --> 35:45.250
Mmm, 'Kay.

35:45.792 --> 35:47.667
Uh, tea?

35:49.334 --> 35:50.334
Coming up.

35:54.334 --> 35:56.250
Honestly, who invented a tie?

35:56.959 --> 35:59.167
Like putting a
leash on yourself!

36:04.334 --> 36:06.501
- There you go.
- Thank you.

36:11.667 --> 36:12.834
Hey Norma.

36:13.125 --> 36:14.125
Evening Willow.

36:14.334 --> 36:15.416
- Coffee?
- Yes please.

36:15.417 --> 36:16.958
I need a pick me up.

36:16.959 --> 36:18.708
I'm working on Taras's dress.

36:18.709 --> 36:21.251
I'll have it one
milk and nine sugars.

36:21.584 --> 36:24.251
You might want to dial
that back a scooch.

36:24.417 --> 36:28.043
Oh no, I love the tingling
feeling it gives me in my toes.

36:29.792 --> 36:31.042
Gonna see this one pretty soon.

36:32.042 --> 36:33.792
That's sugar foot darlin'.

36:34.876 --> 36:35.918
Here.

36:37.834 --> 36:42.501
Let's try a dollop
of honey instead.

36:44.876 --> 36:47.959
You'll never believe
what I saw today.

36:48.459 --> 36:51.210
A UFO?
A log rider?

36:51.626 --> 36:52.626
No?

36:53.250 --> 36:54.250
Blue cats?

36:55.834 --> 36:57.501
I worry for you.

36:58.417 --> 36:59.417
No.

36:59.542 --> 37:02.834
I watched Jerry losing his mind.

37:04.709 --> 37:07.876
Standing right out front here,
talking to an imaginary friend.

37:08.125 --> 37:09.001
Really?

37:09.125 --> 37:13.375
Yeah. Yammerin' on about
dog hallucinations.

37:14.667 --> 37:15.917
Hi there.
Me again.

37:16.209 --> 37:18.751
Uh, who is this Jerry fellow?

37:19.250 --> 37:21.500
You know...
Jerry.

37:21.918 --> 37:23.293
Jerry!

37:23.417 --> 37:25.917
Ah ha. Right.
Remind me.

37:26.209 --> 37:29.543
Jerry who is helping Pete and Tara
with their wedding

37:29.876 --> 37:33.627
they didn't have because
of the, you know...

37:36.459 --> 37:39.668
Right.
Yes of course.

37:39.918 --> 37:40.794
Uh just wondering...

37:40.918 --> 37:43.627
Where might I find my
good buddy Jer tonight?

37:44.125 --> 37:46.250
If he's such a good buddy

37:46.626 --> 37:48.626
you'd know
he doesn't like to be called Jer.

37:48.834 --> 37:49.335
Hmmm...

37:49.501 --> 37:52.710
But he's most likely
at his green house.

37:53.125 --> 37:55.459
Or wherever he
grows his flowers.

37:56.292 --> 37:58.084
Uh, his...

37:58.584 --> 37:59.584
Greenhouse?

38:00.083 --> 38:02.500
Oh yes.
He lives in a green house.

38:03.501 --> 38:05.959
Alright, thank you very much.

38:06.125 --> 38:08.334
Greenhouse for Jerry.

38:09.167 --> 38:10.542
Have a great night.

38:12.501 --> 38:14.959
Jerry's house isn't green.

38:15.083 --> 38:16.334
Yes it is.

38:16.584 --> 38:18.460
I ran into him the other
day and he said...

38:18.626 --> 38:21.127
I'm on my way to
the green house.

38:23.042 --> 38:24.250
Drink your coffee.

38:34.334 --> 38:36.626
Can you believe he's
doing all this for them?

38:37.709 --> 38:40.918
Maybe he needs it...
Like for himself.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.042
Hey, guys.

38:49.375 --> 38:50.917
- Morning, Jerry.
- Hey Jer.

38:55.959 --> 38:57.082
Just...

38:57.083 --> 38:58.792
came by to get this over with.

39:00.417 --> 39:02.918
Figured it would be best to rip
it off quick like a band-aid.

39:04.375 --> 39:05.917
Well the car is in good shape.

39:06.042 --> 39:08.251
I mean...
It runs.

39:09.250 --> 39:10.250
Not so bad.

39:11.292 --> 39:12.292
Yeah.

39:13.083 --> 39:15.875
Would have been nice to
finish it with my Dad but...

39:16.709 --> 39:18.251
But, that's life right?

39:23.626 --> 39:24.626
Anyway...

39:25.501 --> 39:27.125
That's your problem now.

39:28.167 --> 39:30.083
The clutch sticks a
bit going into third.

39:30.709 --> 39:32.876
Come by and drive it
whenever you want.

39:33.250 --> 39:34.250
Thanks.

39:35.042 --> 39:36.166
But...

39:36.167 --> 39:37.501
It just sat there.

39:39.375 --> 39:40.959
And this is a good deal.

39:41.417 --> 39:42.751
You guys get this...

39:43.209 --> 39:45.418
Norma gets the jukebox...

39:46.000 --> 39:49.083
Tara and Pete get food,
and the best band I know.

39:51.417 --> 39:53.083
I've already loaded
up the jukebox.

39:53.375 --> 39:55.542
I told Norma I'd bring
it by after lunch.

39:56.083 --> 39:57.083
I appreciate it.

40:31.209 --> 40:32.375
Hi there.

40:33.209 --> 40:35.000
You must be the
lady of the house.

40:37.542 --> 40:40.209
Sorry. That joke probably
went over your head.

40:40.501 --> 40:43.876
I imagine most do at your
size don't they? Ha, ha ha.

40:47.375 --> 40:48.958
Anyone inside the house speak?

40:48.959 --> 40:51.376
By any chance.
Anyone?

40:52.083 --> 40:54.792
Hi, sorry about that.
I didn't even hear you knock.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.959
She must be talking
your ear off.

40:57.167 --> 41:00.959
Oh, my, uh, ya.
Real chatterbox you got here.

41:02.292 --> 41:04.833
I am here with a
rather specific task.

41:04.834 --> 41:06.710
Uh, what I'm doing is, um...

41:06.876 --> 41:10.750
Oh sweetie,
I can't believe you remembered!

41:10.751 --> 41:12.335
Of course I remembered.

41:12.584 --> 41:16.085
You got me a singing
telegram for my birthday!

41:16.250 --> 41:17.751
Yes, yes I did.

41:18.167 --> 41:21.459
Uhh, I'm sorry there must
be some kind of mis...

41:28.417 --> 41:30.626
Hey, what day is it?

41:30.751 --> 41:32.502
It's your day, this is it.

41:32.709 --> 41:34.875
Hope it's grand, hope it's swell,

41:34.876 --> 41:37.168
hope your year goes as well!

41:37.542 --> 41:41.209
It's your birthday
and your husband...

41:44.584 --> 41:52.168
Dan, will give you back rubs
every night, for a year!

41:52.292 --> 41:54.459
Oh!!

41:54.626 --> 41:57.960
Oh my goodness. Thank you so much.
That was fantastic!

41:58.209 --> 41:59.791
Okay.
C'mon honey,

41:59.792 --> 42:02.416
I'm going to cash in
on one of those back rubs.

42:02.417 --> 42:03.417
Let's go.

42:03.542 --> 42:05.666
Yeah, every year,
or for the rest of my life.

42:05.667 --> 42:06.293
That long.

42:06.501 --> 42:07.751
A bit pitchy.

42:14.501 --> 42:18.667
I forgot to ask about the dog.

42:32.459 --> 42:33.959
My dad used to call me Jer.

42:34.918 --> 42:35.918
Oh.

42:36.918 --> 42:38.416
I know it seems dumb

42:38.417 --> 42:40.709
to ask people not to call me
that, but...

42:43.918 --> 42:45.168
It just hurts too much.

42:46.125 --> 42:47.667
He was a good guy, huh?

42:48.667 --> 42:49.667
The best.

42:51.584 --> 42:52.584
Actually...

42:53.000 --> 42:55.375
He bought that car as a project
for him and I to work on.

42:55.959 --> 42:56.959
That's cool.

42:57.834 --> 42:59.083
He was good with cars?

42:59.959 --> 43:01.375
Not even a bit.

43:03.792 --> 43:04.792
But we learned.

43:06.792 --> 43:09.167
Some of my favorite memories
of my dad were with that car.

43:10.667 --> 43:11.667
This is crazy.

43:12.626 --> 43:15.542
Let's go back and see if we can
figure something else out.

43:16.709 --> 43:17.709
I'm letting him down.

43:19.375 --> 43:21.125
It was just sitting there.

43:21.542 --> 43:23.250
Reminding me of how
much I miss him.

43:25.501 --> 43:27.375
There's no way you're
letting him down.

43:28.042 --> 43:29.542
I bet he's watching.

43:30.125 --> 43:32.042
Super proud of you right now.

43:32.918 --> 43:34.501
At least Paula can do
something with it.

43:35.292 --> 43:38.959
She and her family taught us
everything we know about cars.

43:40.042 --> 43:41.209
They're really good people.

43:43.542 --> 43:44.542
Hey um...

43:45.292 --> 43:48.501
I realized I haven't really said
thank you for doing all this.

43:50.626 --> 43:51.834
You don't have to.

43:53.209 --> 43:54.542
I want to do it.

43:55.709 --> 43:56.834
I owe it to them.

43:57.959 --> 43:59.542
I wish I could help you more.

43:59.751 --> 44:01.584
But you're the only
one who can see me.

44:03.042 --> 44:04.250
You could encourage me.

44:06.375 --> 44:08.167
I could use that sometimes.

44:08.667 --> 44:09.667
You got it!

44:10.375 --> 44:11.459
Let's start now!

44:11.709 --> 44:13.167
Come on champ, get up!

44:13.792 --> 44:14.875
What?

44:14.876 --> 44:18.124
You heard me, get up!
You're gonna climb those stairs!

44:18.125 --> 44:20.334
Then you're gonna
knock that chump out!

44:20.501 --> 44:21.751
Are you quoting Rocky?

44:22.083 --> 44:24.500
Name a better movie
for inspiration.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.125
Can't argue with that.

44:58.918 --> 45:02.918
Here's the flowers
and the gnome just like we promised.

45:38.334 --> 45:39.416
There you go.

45:39.417 --> 45:40.417
Oh my goodness!

45:40.626 --> 45:42.210
- Careful.
- Okay.

45:43.083 --> 45:44.417
Thank you.

45:47.542 --> 45:48.542
Bye.

45:55.375 --> 45:57.000
You don't wave at me like that.

46:00.375 --> 46:01.375
No.

46:02.709 --> 46:04.125
I guess I don't do I?

46:14.792 --> 46:15.876
Afternoon Kevin!

46:18.334 --> 46:19.501
Got that lens for ya.

46:21.876 --> 46:22.876
So you do.

46:24.459 --> 46:25.459
Much obliged.

46:25.584 --> 46:26.376
So...

46:26.501 --> 46:27.501
So we're all square.

46:27.626 --> 46:30.918
That lens, for photography and
the center pieces, yes?

46:31.542 --> 46:32.751
That was the deal.

46:33.501 --> 46:35.377
Perfect!
We'll see you soon.

46:35.876 --> 46:39.710
Unfortunately, I got to
change my conditions.

46:41.167 --> 46:42.167
What?

46:43.125 --> 46:44.125
What's wrong?

46:44.417 --> 46:45.918
Is that lens not the right one?

46:46.250 --> 46:47.250
Lens is fine.

46:47.834 --> 46:49.334
I got something else I need.

46:51.751 --> 46:53.502
Okay.
Uh what do you need?

46:54.083 --> 46:55.959
Hold on.
Let me get us some gloves.

47:02.876 --> 47:03.876
Oh no.

47:04.459 --> 47:05.459
What's wrong?

47:06.375 --> 47:08.750
Kevin is a Golden Gloves boxer.

47:08.751 --> 47:12.001
He probably wants me
to be his training partner.

47:12.125 --> 47:15.417
Oh wow,
that's going to go bad for you.

47:15.751 --> 47:17.751
Have you ever even
been in a fight?

47:22.250 --> 47:24.792
Alright.
Let's get to it.

47:25.375 --> 47:26.459
Kevin.

47:26.918 --> 47:30.585
I'm begging you.
I'll do anything I can...

47:31.417 --> 47:32.417
Jerry...

47:33.542 --> 47:36.167
I need you to help
me with my garden.

47:39.417 --> 47:41.168
Ohh...
Okay then.

47:41.417 --> 47:43.751
Flowers I... I can
help you with.

47:44.292 --> 47:45.334
Umm.

47:59.042 --> 48:00.042
Jerry!

48:00.167 --> 48:01.793
I'm so glad you could make it.

48:01.918 --> 48:02.918
No problem.

48:03.125 --> 48:05.583
Ah so...
I was looking over this list

48:05.584 --> 48:07.500
and it says Pete and Tara
can use your summer house

48:07.501 --> 48:12.127
for their honeymoon
if I can get you a cloud?

48:13.334 --> 48:14.918
You're going to be a clown.

48:15.667 --> 48:16.667
Ohhh...

48:17.375 --> 48:18.709
Oh, this isn't good.

48:19.667 --> 48:20.709
I'll see you in there.

48:22.167 --> 48:23.167
This might not be...

48:23.292 --> 48:26.709
Not a word!
Not... One... Word.

48:37.667 --> 48:38.667
Hey...

48:39.125 --> 48:40.125
Kids.

48:40.501 --> 48:41.501
Clown!

48:41.667 --> 48:44.334
Yay!!

48:45.125 --> 48:46.584
I'm Jerry...

48:47.334 --> 48:48.751
The clown.

48:49.417 --> 48:50.417
Seriously?

48:50.751 --> 48:52.334
That's not a clown name.

48:53.292 --> 48:55.334
I'm going to call you Stinky.

48:57.709 --> 48:58.709
Alright, then.

49:08.709 --> 49:09.959
I'll be right back.

49:16.250 --> 49:17.459
So...

49:18.667 --> 49:20.542
What do you guys want to do?

49:20.876 --> 49:22.958
Let's play throw cake
at the clown!

49:22.959 --> 49:24.709
Yay! Yeah!

49:29.250 --> 49:30.250
Alright...

49:32.667 --> 49:34.417
Throw cake at the clown...

49:35.542 --> 49:36.542
I can't look.

49:36.709 --> 49:38.167
And I can't look away.

50:01.083 --> 50:04.918
Okay. That was fun. But...

50:18.834 --> 50:21.209
That was lovely Paula.
Thank you.

50:21.334 --> 50:22.584
Always my pleasure.

50:23.501 --> 50:24.501
Jerry...

50:24.792 --> 50:27.459
How about an update on our
Church's secret wedding?

50:28.501 --> 50:29.751
Go on.

50:30.834 --> 50:31.834
Come on up.

50:40.751 --> 50:41.751
Right.

50:42.667 --> 50:43.667
Uhh...

50:44.250 --> 50:45.834
I think it's going well!

50:46.918 --> 50:51.710
I've been able to secure the music,
the food, photography.

50:52.501 --> 50:54.250
Flowers are looking great.

50:55.209 --> 50:55.667
But...

50:56.209 --> 50:59.085
Where I fall short,
is in the cash department.

51:00.792 --> 51:02.001
I'm working on it.

51:02.125 --> 51:03.833
I think if I just have a garage sale

51:03.834 --> 51:05.626
and get some of my
stuff out there then...

51:05.751 --> 51:06.751
How much do you need?

51:07.292 --> 51:08.541
Oh...

51:08.542 --> 51:10.876
It isn't much.
I can work it out.

51:11.459 --> 51:13.834
I can give twenty dollars.
It's not much.

51:14.792 --> 51:15.792
Really?

51:17.459 --> 51:18.960
That would be incredible.

51:19.292 --> 51:20.375
I have a dollar.

51:20.876 --> 51:22.584
I got a few bucks
I could throw in.

51:23.334 --> 51:24.458
Shawna...

51:24.459 --> 51:26.418
How about we pass around
the collection plate.

51:26.834 --> 51:30.293
I think this week we'll all
donate it to another good cause.

51:37.042 --> 51:40.000
Oooh, this is going
to be a nice wedding!

51:44.542 --> 51:45.542
Jerry.

51:47.501 --> 51:48.918
Do you have a second?

51:49.292 --> 51:50.292
Ahhh.

51:54.792 --> 51:57.751
Everyone's been really generous.

51:58.334 --> 52:00.542
I think this is actually
going to come together.

52:00.959 --> 52:02.751
Yeah, you did a
really great job.

52:03.334 --> 52:05.626
I couldn't have done it
without all your help.

52:05.876 --> 52:06.876
Oh...

52:07.167 --> 52:09.292
Well since you mentioned it...

52:09.501 --> 52:10.791
I was just wondering

52:10.792 --> 52:13.792
when do I get to cash in
for all of my help?

52:14.792 --> 52:15.792
Oh...

52:16.501 --> 52:18.543
Oh wow, I'm sorry.

52:18.667 --> 52:21.959
I didn't even think of that.
With all that's been going on.

52:23.042 --> 52:24.042
You're right.

52:24.417 --> 52:25.792
What can I do for you?

52:26.083 --> 52:26.875
Well.

52:27.042 --> 52:28.625
There is this person that I did

52:28.626 --> 52:30.875
promise them I'd help
clean out their garage.

52:30.876 --> 52:32.876
I just have literally
not had a second...

52:33.250 --> 52:34.292
So...

52:34.501 --> 52:35.668
Consider it done.

52:36.209 --> 52:37.209
Yeah?

52:37.334 --> 52:39.626
Yeah. What's the address?
I've got the afternoon free.

52:39.918 --> 52:40.918
Perfect.

52:41.501 --> 52:46.751
Honestly Jerry, this is such a
huge help. Thank you so much.

52:50.083 --> 52:51.083
Tara's house.

52:54.542 --> 52:55.626
You have to talk to her.

52:56.292 --> 52:58.042
I really don't
think she wants...

52:58.167 --> 53:00.625
Sometimes what people wanna do,
and what people need to do...

53:00.626 --> 53:02.125
Are two different things.

53:03.459 --> 53:04.459
Okay.

53:06.334 --> 53:09.210
Thanks Jerry.
I really appreciate it.

53:21.876 --> 53:22.876
Hey.

53:27.334 --> 53:29.793
I don't really know
how this all works.

53:31.918 --> 53:35.291
I mean that,
I know we don't chat that often,

53:35.292 --> 53:37.542
and I'm not blaming you, that's...

53:38.167 --> 53:39.167
That's on me...

53:40.918 --> 53:42.542
But if you have a sec...

53:43.250 --> 53:44.959
I could really use some advice.

53:46.959 --> 53:48.501
I know I screwed up.

53:50.876 --> 53:51.876
I do.

53:52.083 --> 53:53.083
And...

53:53.918 --> 53:55.667
I'm really sorry.

53:58.709 --> 54:01.293
And I'm scared to death
of seeing them.

54:05.459 --> 54:06.668
So if you could just...

54:07.626 --> 54:08.918
send me a sign.

54:10.459 --> 54:11.791
Anything.

54:11.792 --> 54:15.501
Just show me that
they even want to talk to me.

54:16.876 --> 54:17.876
I'll go.

54:18.834 --> 54:20.666
Jerry come on man.

54:20.667 --> 54:22.959
It's like a bazillion
degrees out there.

54:28.042 --> 54:30.250
You picked a
seriously odd angel.

54:47.083 --> 54:49.292
I could really use some of
that encouragement right now.

54:50.292 --> 54:51.375
Put a foot forward.

54:51.542 --> 54:53.792
Take the first step...
That's all it takes.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.334
I think I need to do it alone...

54:57.501 --> 54:58.501
If that's okay?

54:59.751 --> 55:01.000
I'll be right here.

55:11.626 --> 55:12.626
Jerry?

55:14.501 --> 55:15.501
Hi.

55:16.959 --> 55:17.959
Hi.

55:19.501 --> 55:21.541
I... Uh...

55:21.542 --> 55:23.875
Probably should have thought
about what I was going to say

55:23.876 --> 55:26.043
before I actually stepped up here.

55:27.584 --> 55:30.001
I'm not exactly great
at thinking on my feet.

55:31.959 --> 55:32.959
Tara.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.584
What are you doing here Jerry?

55:41.751 --> 55:42.751
Here it goes...

55:46.083 --> 55:48.542
I was talking to your sister.
And she thought that...

55:48.751 --> 55:50.250
Why were talking to my sister?

55:50.834 --> 55:52.626
It's a long story.

55:52.834 --> 55:54.082
We don't care.

55:54.083 --> 55:55.250
I think we've heard enough.

55:55.959 --> 55:57.543
Please don't come here again.

56:00.334 --> 56:01.334
Wait.

56:05.375 --> 56:06.375
Come on in.

56:09.918 --> 56:11.167
What are you doing?

56:11.375 --> 56:13.876
He took the first step,
so I'm inviting him in.

56:14.209 --> 56:15.751
That's the family rule.

56:34.584 --> 56:36.334
You have a really
nice place here.

56:40.167 --> 56:41.167
Right.

56:42.083 --> 56:43.334
No small talk.

56:46.250 --> 56:47.459
I don't like dogs.

56:48.501 --> 56:51.043
- What?
- Unbelievable.

56:53.792 --> 56:55.710
I just never understood them.

56:56.501 --> 56:58.250
The way that they smell...

56:58.792 --> 57:00.918
Jumping all over you.
Or licking your face.

57:01.042 --> 57:02.959
Is this really what
you came to say?

57:04.834 --> 57:06.083
I finally understood.

57:08.250 --> 57:09.250
That day.

57:10.459 --> 57:13.459
When I saw what I'd
done, to you...

57:15.626 --> 57:17.209
The look on your face...

57:19.250 --> 57:20.459
All at once...

57:23.000 --> 57:25.209
I finally knew what all
the other people knew.

57:28.459 --> 57:29.542
That accident...

57:33.209 --> 57:35.292
I didn't just take
your dog from you...

57:37.584 --> 57:38.876
I took your family.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.542
I left the gate open.

57:47.959 --> 57:50.959
I ran to grab the phone,
and I left the gate open.

57:51.626 --> 57:53.751
It's my fault he ran
out into the street.

57:54.709 --> 57:56.959
I blame myself for
not being there.

58:01.626 --> 58:02.751
I'm gonna go.

58:04.042 --> 58:07.250
I just thought I should
come by, and I did, so...

58:11.292 --> 58:13.292
I'm really glad you came over.

58:14.751 --> 58:15.751
Me too.

58:18.751 --> 58:19.751
Oh.

58:20.250 --> 58:21.459
I almost forgot...

58:21.751 --> 58:25.377
Uh... Shawna said you needed some
help cleaning your garage.

58:26.459 --> 58:28.793
- What?
- I don't have a garage.

58:29.626 --> 58:30.626
Really?

58:31.042 --> 58:33.668
I kind of owed her,
so I was repaying the favor.

58:35.876 --> 58:37.292
I think you just did.

58:51.918 --> 58:52.918
One more thing.

58:53.334 --> 58:54.334
It's...

58:54.584 --> 58:57.999
Kind of a long shot, but...
I promised your dad

58:58.000 --> 59:01.250
I'd try to see if I could get you
to come to church this Sunday?

59:03.918 --> 59:05.335
Tell him...

59:05.876 --> 59:06.876
We'll be there.

59:07.667 --> 59:08.667
Great.

59:08.834 --> 59:09.834
See you there.

59:20.459 --> 59:22.584
You got a good family there pal.

59:22.876 --> 59:24.460
I got a good friend too.

59:32.584 --> 59:34.625
I really appreciate
you letting us use your space

59:34.626 --> 59:35.668
for the reception.

59:35.792 --> 59:38.249
Oh, I'm so excited!
I love weddings.

59:38.250 --> 59:40.333
You sure we can get it all
done by this weekend?

59:40.334 --> 59:42.249
Of course!
I'm finished Tara's dress.

59:42.250 --> 59:44.709
And there is just a few things
to clean up around the studio.

59:53.709 --> 59:56.751
If you could grab that bucket,
I think I can handle the rest.

59:57.959 --> 01:00:00.167
How are we supposed to get
this place ready by Sunday?

01:00:00.542 --> 01:00:02.459
You can start by...
Grabbing that bucket.

01:00:12.834 --> 01:00:13.918
I have an idea.

01:00:19.709 --> 01:00:21.501
You didn't even move the bucket.

01:00:24.667 --> 01:00:26.334
Hey!
We got the good stuff today.

01:00:34.501 --> 01:00:36.419
- Shawna.
- Jerry, what's wrong?

01:00:36.751 --> 01:00:38.377
Nothing.
Well...

01:00:39.667 --> 01:00:40.667
Willow's place.

01:00:41.334 --> 01:00:42.793
How much money did we make?

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.751
I don't know. I'd have to
double check, but quite a bit.

01:00:46.334 --> 01:00:47.334
Why?

01:00:49.459 --> 01:00:50.459
Hey everyone.

01:00:50.709 --> 01:00:52.917
Uh, sorry to interrupt
your breakfast.

01:00:52.918 --> 01:00:54.960
But I was wondering
if anybody might like a job?

01:00:55.709 --> 01:00:56.876
Alright.

01:00:57.125 --> 01:01:00.459
Then finish your food
and come meet me at Willow's studio.

01:01:04.375 --> 01:01:07.375
By the way, thank you for
making me talk to your sister.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Hey you, I was going
to move your bucket.

01:01:17.167 --> 01:01:20.042
But I was like - Nope!
That's Jerry's bucket.

01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:23.834
I know, but Willow...
Meet your new employees!

01:01:25.542 --> 01:01:27.083
What can we do to help?

01:01:28.209 --> 01:01:30.792
Let's turn this place
into a reception.

01:01:56.042 --> 01:01:57.209
Put it over there.

01:02:13.501 --> 01:02:15.127
Oh, careful.
Watch out.

01:02:23.709 --> 01:02:26.501
I think we need something
here where the food will go.

01:02:26.626 --> 01:02:30.626
Ah Willow, do we have anything
that will make this area pop?

01:02:31.501 --> 01:02:32.710
Here!
I made this!

01:02:35.334 --> 01:02:37.999
Umm, I think this will be perfect
at the front,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.791
you know, where everyone can see it.

01:02:39.792 --> 01:02:42.917
Fantastic!
Wait until you see this baby lit up.

01:02:55.459 --> 01:02:57.042
I think that's about it.

01:03:06.417 --> 01:03:07.959
Please tell me we're done.

01:03:08.667 --> 01:03:12.125
All trades, all jobs,
all favors exchanged.

01:03:12.709 --> 01:03:14.792
We are now officially finished.

01:03:15.667 --> 01:03:18.501
Thank goodness.
Can I sleep now?

01:03:19.459 --> 01:03:22.126
We can sleep after the
wedding tomorrow.

01:03:24.876 --> 01:03:27.502
If you get that, I'll let you
be the little spoon tonight.

01:03:27.709 --> 01:03:29.627
Ah ha, they can't see me.

01:03:30.334 --> 01:03:31.459
Would you if they could?

01:03:31.959 --> 01:03:33.084
We'll never know.

01:03:36.167 --> 01:03:37.167
Alright!

01:03:37.876 --> 01:03:39.210
I'll be right there.

01:03:44.584 --> 01:03:46.460
Come with me,
in case I fall asleep.

01:03:55.459 --> 01:03:56.459
Hi there.

01:03:56.959 --> 01:03:57.959
Can I help you?

01:03:58.250 --> 01:04:00.417
Hi.
You!

01:04:01.167 --> 01:04:02.167
Me?

01:04:03.125 --> 01:04:04.208
You can see him?

01:04:04.751 --> 01:04:05.791
Him?

01:04:05.792 --> 01:04:09.001
Ya, course I can see him! I've been
searching for him all over town.

01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:10.834
You're the little fella.

01:04:11.751 --> 01:04:13.335
First of all, very rude.

01:04:14.375 --> 01:04:15.625
I am as I was created.

01:04:15.834 --> 01:04:18.501
Second of all, yes.
I'm the little Fe...

01:04:21.292 --> 01:04:22.626
The one you ran away from.

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:25.375
So if you don't mind,
I'd like to go back.

01:04:25.501 --> 01:04:26.958
Please open the gate, let's go.

01:04:26.959 --> 01:04:27.959
Hold on!

01:04:28.584 --> 01:04:29.834
I don't understand.

01:04:30.417 --> 01:04:31.834
Where'd you say you came from?

01:04:32.542 --> 01:04:33.876
You said you were...

01:04:37.083 --> 01:04:38.083
Oh wow.

01:04:40.709 --> 01:04:41.709
Are you...

01:04:42.125 --> 01:04:44.292
No.
I just work there.

01:04:44.584 --> 01:04:46.709
Or at least I did
before all this mess.

01:04:47.459 --> 01:04:49.335
So if you don't mind...
Please.

01:04:49.876 --> 01:04:50.876
I can't.

01:04:52.083 --> 01:04:53.208
Why?

01:04:53.792 --> 01:04:54.792
Please, I...

01:04:55.167 --> 01:04:57.541
I know this seems crazy,
but we've been working so hard

01:04:57.542 --> 01:04:58.833
to keep this wedding together.

01:04:58.834 --> 01:05:00.126
And tomorrow's the day.

01:05:00.250 --> 01:05:02.375
See first Jerry had
to feed the homeless.

01:05:02.876 --> 01:05:04.168
That's where he met Shawna.

01:05:04.375 --> 01:05:07.084
And then we were helping
Norma, and Kevin's flowers...

01:05:07.417 --> 01:05:09.043
Oh yeah sure.
Kevin deserves flowers.

01:05:09.250 --> 01:05:12.375
And then Shawna convinced him
to talk to Tara and Pete.

01:05:12.751 --> 01:05:14.043
And now everything is set.

01:05:14.250 --> 01:05:17.084
What and, I talked to your boss,
and he sent me a sign!

01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:18.834
What?
You didn't tell me that.

01:05:18.959 --> 01:05:20.626
Yeah, it was really cool.

01:05:20.751 --> 01:05:22.666
Sorry, I meant to tell you.

01:05:22.667 --> 01:05:24.585
Alright you know what, this is..

01:05:24.709 --> 01:05:25.418
This is...

01:05:25.626 --> 01:05:27.124
This is a wonderful story.

01:05:27.125 --> 01:05:29.999
And I'm sure it's going to have
just a fantastic ending.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.542
But you and I, we will be
watching from up there.

01:05:32.667 --> 01:05:34.625
You know, that is if
you're still invited.

01:05:34.626 --> 01:05:35.460
Look...

01:05:35.584 --> 01:05:39.376
I know this seems crazy.
I hardly even believe it myself, but

01:05:40.417 --> 01:05:45.082
the fact is, Gabe talked to me...
and he came back.

01:05:45.083 --> 01:05:47.458
So there must be
some sort of reason, right?

01:05:50.334 --> 01:05:51.334
It's possible.

01:05:51.876 --> 01:05:53.918
So just let us just
see this through.

01:05:54.167 --> 01:05:58.250
Then I promise,
tomorrow I go with you. No running.

01:06:01.834 --> 01:06:03.168
You know what?
Fine.

01:06:03.375 --> 01:06:05.458
I probably lost my
job already anyway.

01:06:06.584 --> 01:06:08.001
Ahh... I am so tired.

01:06:09.959 --> 01:06:11.543
You can stay at my place.

01:06:14.375 --> 01:06:15.459
Thank you.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.292
I already called dibs
on the little spoon.

01:06:19.459 --> 01:06:21.042
Already regretting this.

01:06:31.792 --> 01:06:33.459
Why do you sleep on the floor?

01:06:35.584 --> 01:06:36.584
What?

01:06:36.876 --> 01:06:38.209
Where else was I
suppose to sleep?

01:06:38.626 --> 01:06:40.835
In the bed.
That's where I sleep.

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:47.584
What? I didn't even know
that was an option.

01:06:49.375 --> 01:06:51.584
Uhh mm my back.

01:06:52.584 --> 01:06:54.126
Come on.
I need a walk.

01:06:54.542 --> 01:06:56.459
I'm taking Denny to
help me with something.

01:06:56.751 --> 01:06:58.083
Call if you need us.

01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:01.001
Phone two dogs,
that's perfectly normal.

01:07:03.918 --> 01:07:04.918
Have fun!

01:07:11.626 --> 01:07:13.085
Hey Willow.
What's up?

01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:16.584
Okay. I...

01:07:16.751 --> 01:07:19.335
Just stay calm.
I"ll... I'll be right there.

01:07:20.501 --> 01:07:22.960
- I just think it's very important.
- Yeah, as do I.

01:07:24.751 --> 01:07:25.751
Hey.

01:07:25.876 --> 01:07:26.876
What's wrong?

01:07:27.083 --> 01:07:29.542
The wedding's off.
We should call Pete and Tara.

01:07:29.709 --> 01:07:30.460
What?

01:07:30.584 --> 01:07:33.460
No, no nothing's off.
Just the power's down.

01:07:33.709 --> 01:07:37.210
I called, the whole block will be
out for probably at least a day.

01:07:37.542 --> 01:07:39.126
Does that mean the church too?

01:07:39.417 --> 01:07:42.667
Yeah, yeah. Dad called me,
he was out buying candles.

01:07:44.334 --> 01:07:45.626
This is perfect.

01:07:45.918 --> 01:07:46.918
We're done.

01:07:47.083 --> 01:07:48.666
No, no, we're not done.

01:07:48.667 --> 01:07:51.334
We just need to find
somewhere that still has power.

01:07:51.876 --> 01:07:53.168
What about your greenhouse?

01:07:54.292 --> 01:07:55.834
I don't know.

01:07:55.959 --> 01:07:58.626
It's big enough, but it's
not exactly reception ready.

01:07:59.042 --> 01:08:00.042
I can fix that.

01:08:00.459 --> 01:08:03.208
Carrie, I can't ask
you to do this.

01:08:03.209 --> 01:08:05.625
I mean we spent all the money
trying to get this place ready.

01:08:05.626 --> 01:08:07.876
I didn't say anything about money.
Leave it to me.

01:08:09.042 --> 01:08:10.334
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:08:11.209 --> 01:08:12.710
Just get them there
on time, okay.

01:08:15.792 --> 01:08:18.957
Okay, great. I will call
everyone and let them know.

01:08:18.959 --> 01:08:20.917
And make sure everyone
lends a helping hand.

01:08:21.042 --> 01:08:22.251
Alright then!

01:08:22.542 --> 01:08:25.500
Wedding's back on!
And I've got tons of candles.

01:08:25.501 --> 01:08:27.127
I'll see you guys at the church.

01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:28.459
Okay great!

01:08:30.250 --> 01:08:31.250
Go team!

01:08:36.082 --> 01:08:39.250
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:42.500
You okay?

01:08:42.959 --> 01:08:44.042
Yeah.

01:08:44.209 --> 01:08:45.251
You?

01:08:45.459 --> 01:08:46.459
Yeah.

01:08:52.834 --> 01:08:53.917
This is crazy...

01:08:54.501 --> 01:08:56.252
You know they can see me right?

01:08:56.417 --> 01:08:58.626
I need to make
sure they're gone.

01:09:03.584 --> 01:09:04.584
Okay, come on.

01:09:04.876 --> 01:09:05.876
Let's go.

01:09:10.501 --> 01:09:13.417
I need you to help me fix
something I screwed up.

01:09:27.501 --> 01:09:29.334
They can't get married
without them.

01:09:31.042 --> 01:09:32.959
You know, they don't
actually need these, right.

01:09:34.375 --> 01:09:35.876
Honestly, it's just a symbol.

01:09:36.125 --> 01:09:37.959
If they love each
other, it's enough.

01:09:38.082 --> 01:09:39.082
I know.

01:09:39.459 --> 01:09:41.750
But I want to make
today such a good day,

01:09:41.751 --> 01:09:44.084
that they forget about the bad day.

01:09:46.334 --> 01:09:47.917
They are never going
to forget that day.

01:09:52.042 --> 01:09:55.501
It probably wouldn't hurt if they
didn't forget this day either.

01:09:58.083 --> 01:09:59.208
Alright.
C'mon.

01:10:00.167 --> 01:10:01.834
I knew you were a softy.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.209
Where is everyone?

01:10:12.834 --> 01:10:14.251
- Hey Dad.
- Hi guys.

01:10:14.417 --> 01:10:16.751
What's going on?
Why isn't anyone at church?

01:10:17.417 --> 01:10:20.376
Oh they're at church.
They just aren't here.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.209
So what are we doing, then?

01:10:22.792 --> 01:10:25.543
Something we should have
done a long time ago.

01:10:26.459 --> 01:10:28.501
Why don't you go inside
and get changed.

01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:29.625
Changed?

01:10:29.626 --> 01:10:31.335
Yeah, so we can get started.

01:10:32.501 --> 01:10:33.501
Go on.

01:10:35.959 --> 01:10:37.835
Let's get you a bow tie.

01:10:38.083 --> 01:10:39.166
Okay.

01:11:12.792 --> 01:11:15.001
Oh just set it on the head table.

01:12:57.417 --> 01:12:58.834
Dearly beloved

01:13:00.167 --> 01:13:01.709
we are gathered here today

01:13:02.501 --> 01:13:04.002
to join this man

01:13:05.125 --> 01:13:08.542
and this beautiful
woman in holy matrimony.

01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:13.210
And love, is not just a word.

01:13:14.751 --> 01:13:19.960
Love is that last thought you
have before you go to sleep.

01:13:20.918 --> 01:13:24.127
It's that hand that you hold onto,

01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:28.959
not because you have to,
but because you can.

01:13:30.459 --> 01:13:34.251
And sometimes love is not even
for us. We give love to others...

01:13:34.918 --> 01:13:36.877
Just to see them smile.

01:13:38.042 --> 01:13:39.668
And the best part is...

01:13:40.834 --> 01:13:44.084
Love is something that
we don't run out of.

01:13:46.542 --> 01:13:49.625
Even when we loose someone

01:13:51.667 --> 01:13:54.209
that we poured our whole heart into

01:13:55.542 --> 01:13:59.168
we realize that when
it comes to love

01:14:00.751 --> 01:14:02.793
always find a little more to give.

01:14:05.626 --> 01:14:07.583
The rings, now the rings.

01:14:07.584 --> 01:14:09.959
Oh, we don't have them.

01:14:10.167 --> 01:14:12.043
- Yeah, we lost them.
- It's okay.

01:14:26.250 --> 01:14:29.542
Thought you two might be able
to give this guy a good home.

01:14:35.292 --> 01:14:36.292
Our rings!

01:14:36.542 --> 01:14:37.709
How did you find them?

01:14:39.501 --> 01:14:42.293
I guess someone who
loves you found them.

01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:51.584
Come on, let's get ready.

01:14:55.417 --> 01:14:56.417
Do you, Pete...

01:14:58.459 --> 01:15:00.292
Take my beautiful daughter...

01:15:01.584 --> 01:15:02.709
To be your bride?

01:15:03.626 --> 01:15:04.626
I do.

01:15:12.334 --> 01:15:13.584
And do you, Tara...

01:15:14.083 --> 01:15:16.083
Take Pete, to be your husband?

01:15:17.334 --> 01:15:18.668
I do.

01:15:25.876 --> 01:15:30.043
And I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:16:21.042 --> 01:16:22.292
This is beautiful.

01:16:23.125 --> 01:16:25.000
Too bad everyone else
couldn't be here.

01:16:37.125 --> 01:16:38.209
Thanks Dad.

01:16:59.918 --> 01:17:03.001
<i>♪ It ain't what
she's wearing</i>

01:17:04.667 --> 01:17:07.209

01:17:56.626 --> 01:17:59.542
Ladies and gentleman,
Pete and Tara Maguire.

01:19:14.918 --> 01:19:17.417
I can't believe what an
incredible job you did.

01:19:17.709 --> 01:19:19.335
It was easy with so much help.

01:19:19.501 --> 01:19:22.960
No really.
You've got a great eye for this.

01:19:23.501 --> 01:19:25.043
Hey, this is your place right?

01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:26.459
It is, yes.

01:19:26.751 --> 01:19:29.293
We were hoping we could book
it for our wedding this fall.

01:19:29.542 --> 01:19:31.166
Oh, well, it's not really...

01:19:31.167 --> 01:19:32.374
As long as it's not the day

01:19:32.375 --> 01:19:34.876
that I would like to book
this place for renewing my vows.

01:19:36.417 --> 01:19:40.792
Well, you guys can book
that through my new partner.

01:19:43.584 --> 01:19:44.584
Partner?

01:19:46.125 --> 01:19:47.125
Yeah.

01:19:47.250 --> 01:19:50.250
She's in charge of booking
all weddings, parties

01:19:50.667 --> 01:19:51.876
whatever you need.

01:19:52.292 --> 01:19:55.417
Great. Let's step over here and
talk about what you're thinking.

01:20:03.792 --> 01:20:05.082
So you throw one wedding

01:20:05.083 --> 01:20:06.999
and you're starting a business
now, huh?

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.584
Well, I figure it's pretty easy.

01:20:09.709 --> 01:20:13.376
As long as I employ every person
in town every time I need help.

01:20:16.167 --> 01:20:17.668
Look how happy she looks.

01:20:19.501 --> 01:20:20.709
She deserves it.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.918
You did a really great thing.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.334
We'll be back in a couple
minutes to do another set.

01:20:28.501 --> 01:20:30.625
But for now it's
time for you chickens

01:20:30.626 --> 01:20:32.959
to ask those pretty girls to dance.

01:20:34.751 --> 01:20:35.793
What do you say?

01:20:37.584 --> 01:20:38.667
I would love to.

01:20:51.459 --> 01:20:52.459
Time to go.

01:20:52.959 --> 01:20:53.959
Alright.

01:20:55.375 --> 01:20:57.167
They look happy don't they?

01:20:59.209 --> 01:21:00.209
Which one?

01:21:01.584 --> 01:21:02.584
All of them.

01:21:12.167 --> 01:21:13.167
C'mon.

01:21:14.584 --> 01:21:15.626
Hey.

01:21:20.626 --> 01:21:21.960
Two minutes?

01:21:23.959 --> 01:21:25.209
Do I have a choice?

01:21:26.834 --> 01:21:27.834
Take your time.

01:21:29.459 --> 01:21:31.793
So, that was it.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.125
You're just going to leave?

01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:35.250
No goodbyes?

01:21:35.751 --> 01:21:37.085
My job here is done.

01:21:37.584 --> 01:21:39.459
Tara and Pete got their wedding.

01:21:39.876 --> 01:21:41.542
I got to make a new friend.

01:21:42.125 --> 01:21:43.918
Looks like you did too huh?

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Yeah.

01:21:47.083 --> 01:21:48.083
I guess so.

01:21:51.959 --> 01:21:53.334
I'm going to miss you Gabe.

01:21:54.292 --> 01:21:56.417
I'm going to miss you too Jerry.

01:21:59.167 --> 01:22:00.167
Call me Jer.

01:22:01.334 --> 01:22:02.417
Jer it is.

01:22:04.584 --> 01:22:05.584
Hey.

01:22:08.876 --> 01:22:10.167
What's it like up there?

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.876
It's like a long drive where
the window's always down.

01:22:25.626 --> 01:22:27.334
You're a good boy Gabe.

01:22:48.375 --> 01:22:49.375
Ummm.

01:22:51.334 --> 01:22:54.751
So we didn't know
this was happening

01:22:55.542 --> 01:22:57.167
Um so obviously

01:22:57.626 --> 01:22:59.626
I didn't plan anything to say.

01:23:03.167 --> 01:23:05.250
We've had a pretty tough time

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.292
And sadly

01:23:09.417 --> 01:23:11.417
I chose to hide
it from everyone.

01:23:15.125 --> 01:23:16.709
But when I look around

01:23:17.459 --> 01:23:18.918
at all of this,

01:23:19.375 --> 01:23:21.792
what everyone did, just because,

01:23:24.918 --> 01:23:27.502
I realize how lucky we
are to have friends.

01:23:28.250 --> 01:23:29.250
Family.

01:23:29.709 --> 01:23:31.126
Like all of you.

01:23:33.792 --> 01:23:35.626
And the more we talk to everyone

01:23:35.876 --> 01:23:38.627
the more we learn
what love truly means.

01:23:40.876 --> 01:23:45.000
So we'd like you all to join us
in a very special toast.

01:23:46.667 --> 01:23:48.166
To Jerry!

01:23:48.167 --> 01:23:49.833
- To Jerry!
- To Jerry!

01:23:49.834 --> 01:23:51.876
C'mon, come here.

01:23:56.209 --> 01:23:57.792
To Jerry!

01:24:02.167 --> 01:24:03.167
Thank you.

01:24:04.501 --> 01:24:05.501
Thank you.

01:24:06.501 --> 01:24:09.041
- I have to go.
- Oh, no.

01:24:09.042 --> 01:24:10.417
- Stay.
- Come on.

01:24:24.584 --> 01:24:25.584
Hey.

01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:28.709
You alright?

01:24:29.167 --> 01:24:33.085
Yeah. Just, I don't take
compliments very well.

01:24:34.209 --> 01:24:36.708
Well, then you probably
shouldn't go back in there.

01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:38.959
Everybody's waiting
to congratulate you.

01:24:39.876 --> 01:24:40.876
Perfect.

01:24:41.626 --> 01:24:43.834
Well hey you don't
have to go back in.

01:24:44.918 --> 01:24:45.959
Let's do something.

01:24:46.834 --> 01:24:48.752
Just you and me?

01:24:48.876 --> 01:24:50.085
Yeah sure why not?

01:24:51.209 --> 01:24:52.209
I'd love to.

01:24:52.626 --> 01:24:53.626
Yeah?

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.250
That sounds great.

01:25:01.125 --> 01:25:03.375
Sorry.
The truck's kind of a mess.

01:25:03.626 --> 01:25:04.751
I don't mind.

01:25:05.083 --> 01:25:06.083
Hey!

01:25:14.250 --> 01:25:17.168
What? Did you really think
we were taking this car?

01:25:20.334 --> 01:25:23.876
I've watched you and your dad fix
the car up ever since we were kids.

01:25:24.125 --> 01:25:26.125
I just needed to
finish it up for you.

01:25:28.167 --> 01:25:29.834
I don't know what to say?

01:25:31.083 --> 01:25:34.333
I thought you could use someone
doing something nice for you too.

01:25:39.042 --> 01:25:40.125
Go enjoy it Bud.

01:25:41.459 --> 01:25:42.918
We love you Jer.

01:25:49.125 --> 01:25:50.125
After you.

01:25:52.667 --> 01:25:54.625
Well, he's off to a good start.

01:25:54.626 --> 01:25:56.544
I'd say you're right.

01:26:26.876 --> 01:26:27.959
Okay...

01:26:28.167 --> 01:26:30.500
This time you have to promise
to go through.

01:26:30.501 --> 01:26:32.710
I am really behind
on my paper work.

01:26:32.959 --> 01:26:34.418
Don't worry.
I promise.

01:26:34.667 --> 01:26:37.126
Nothing's gonna stop me
from going through this time.

01:26:37.667 --> 01:26:39.750
Hey I think I'm lost.

01:26:44.667 --> 01:26:45.834
Oh no.
