00:00.467 --> 00:02.667
<i>In new York city's war on crime</i>

00:02.668 --> 00:04.818
<i>the worst criminal
offenders are pursued</i>

00:04.819 --> 00:07.586
<i>by the detectives of
the Major Case Squad.</i>

00:07.587 --> 00:09.772
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:12.015 --> 00:15.385
- Medina Stavro, 31,
brunette.

00:15.386 --> 00:18.621
She's a pediatrician
at mt. Sinai.

00:18.622 --> 00:20.557
She's the niece
of Nicholas Stavro.

00:20.558 --> 00:23.126
Of course, you know
the Greek shipping family.

00:23.127 --> 00:26.129
- Hmm. No sports
in her background, huh?

00:26.130 --> 00:28.164
- Oh, she's very athletic.

00:28.165 --> 00:30.033
David, look at those eyes.

00:30.034 --> 00:31.901
- Mm. Not feeling it,
Steph.

00:34.338 --> 00:37.140
- Andrea stiles.

00:37.141 --> 00:39.309
She modeled in paris.

00:39.310 --> 00:41.945
She has a PHD from Yale.

00:41.946 --> 00:45.014
She teaches French lit
at Columbia...

00:45.015 --> 00:47.550
And <i>look</i> at her.

00:47.551 --> 00:49.986
- Does she have a lazy eye?
- David,

00:49.987 --> 00:53.723
you are paying me $200,000
for my services.

00:53.724 --> 00:56.025
Now, let's do one more
meet and greet,

00:56.026 --> 00:57.894
and see how it goes.

00:57.895 --> 00:59.762
And then you can
go back to doing

00:59.763 --> 01:02.232
what or whomever you're doing.

01:02.233 --> 01:05.068
- Okay.
Okay, Stephanie.

01:05.069 --> 01:06.436
Good boy.

01:06.437 --> 01:09.539
- But is there such a thing
as too perfect?

01:09.540 --> 01:10.707
- No!

01:10.708 --> 01:12.809
Let's hope that
you feel it with Andrea.

01:12.810 --> 01:15.845
And by the way, she has
an I.Q. Of 175.

01:15.846 --> 01:18.414
You better brush up
on your proust.

01:18.415 --> 01:20.316
- If you don't want to go
to code-

01:20.317 --> 01:21.818
the city's not gonna
let us go code,

01:21.819 --> 01:24.587
so it's gonna be-
the operation's gonna be-

01:24.588 --> 01:27.991
- how you doing, Shawn?
- Hey, Mr. Driscoll-

01:29.927 --> 01:32.028
You ratted me out
to <i>this</i> guy?

01:32.029 --> 01:33.363
- What-

01:33.364 --> 01:34.931
jeez, what are you
<i>talking</i> about?

01:37.568 --> 01:39.602
- You're a snitch.
- What?

01:41.572 --> 01:42.672
- Take it easy, dad.

01:42.673 --> 01:45.175
- I'm a bookie.
I'm not a snitch.

01:45.176 --> 01:46.609
Why the hell would
Jack Driscoll

01:46.610 --> 01:47.710
do something like that
to me?

01:47.711 --> 01:51.147
- Hey, have you eaten?

01:51.148 --> 01:54.817
What?

01:54.818 --> 01:57.119
- You look just like
your mother, God rest her soul.

02:01.892 --> 02:05.028
You know, life is
essentially a cheat,

02:05.029 --> 02:08.064
and its conditions are
those of defeat.

02:08.065 --> 02:11.534
- Let me guess...
F. Scott Fitzgerald.

02:11.535 --> 02:14.170
- Mmm.
That's my girl.

02:16.607 --> 02:18.675
- So you hit it big
on wall street,

02:18.676 --> 02:20.643
and you know your way
around a proust novel.

02:20.644 --> 02:22.679
I'm impressed.

02:22.680 --> 02:24.047
- What if I'm
a serial killer?

02:24.048 --> 02:28.751
- Well, you take the good
with the bad.

02:28.752 --> 02:31.387
You're not into this,
are you?

02:31.388 --> 02:33.756
- No, no, you're great.
I'm just-I'm a little-

02:33.757 --> 02:35.758
- David. Hi.

02:35.759 --> 02:37.894
Nice to see you.
- Nicki.

02:37.895 --> 02:40.930
- Did he get to the part
about his quest

02:40.931 --> 02:42.732
to discover his
spiritual identity yet?

02:42.733 --> 02:46.569
- Uh, no, I'm afraid not.

02:46.570 --> 02:49.605
- I don't usually bust that out
until dessert, so...

02:55.813 --> 02:58.114
Seriously?

02:58.115 --> 03:00.250
- It's undignified, I know.

03:00.251 --> 03:02.986
But I don't care anymore.

03:02.987 --> 03:06.956
I'm on to the next, David.
We're done.

03:06.957 --> 03:10.059
- I'm happy for you.

03:16.667 --> 03:17.767
- Thank you for dinner.

03:17.768 --> 03:19.235
- I'm sorry about
all that.

03:19.236 --> 03:21.070
- You've got things
on your mind.

03:21.071 --> 03:22.572
I'm around
if you get them off.

03:22.573 --> 03:25.975
- Thanks.

03:25.976 --> 03:28.211
I live close,
so I'm gonna walk.

03:28.212 --> 03:30.747
There you go, pal.

03:37.120 --> 03:39.455
I know what you're doing,
Skinner, I do.

03:39.456 --> 03:41.791
And you're a <i>de</i> man!

<b>Adriano_csi
www.Addic7ed.Com</b>

04:50.572 --> 04:53.423
Black male, 40.

04:53.458 --> 04:56.275
Business card says
he was the CEO

04:56.276 --> 04:59.244
an investment bank.

04:59.245 --> 05:03.048
Took two to the chest.
Looks like a 38.

05:03.049 --> 05:05.651
Time of death around
11:30 P.M.

05:05.652 --> 05:08.153
- Witnesses?
- None so far.

05:08.154 --> 05:11.857
Shooter wasn't in range
of any of the surveillance cams.

05:11.858 --> 05:14.827
- There's no signs of struggle.
No scratches, no scrapes.

05:14.828 --> 05:17.329
His tie is still
nice and tight.

05:17.330 --> 05:18.898
- The shooter took the cash,

05:18.899 --> 05:22.134
left the wallet
and the credit cards.

05:22.135 --> 05:24.970
- He's got two
in the chest.

05:24.971 --> 05:26.805
It's personal.
It's not a pro.

05:26.806 --> 05:28.841
- Maybe our shooter
resisted the robbery,

05:28.842 --> 05:30.409
but I don't see it.

05:30.410 --> 05:33.913
- Silk tie, Italian shoes,
custom suit.

05:33.914 --> 05:35.381
- Another master of the universe
goes down,

05:35.382 --> 05:37.449
hence major case.

05:37.450 --> 05:39.385
- No wedding ring.

05:39.386 --> 05:41.854
The only thing missing
from the perfect

05:41.855 --> 05:44.790
investment banker profile

05:44.791 --> 05:47.092
is an expensive timepiece.

05:47.093 --> 05:49.395
This is
a department store watch.

05:49.396 --> 05:50.663
Under $80.

05:50.664 --> 05:55.434
Tan line. Discoloration...
It's square.

05:55.435 --> 05:58.103
The watch he's wearing
is round-faced.

05:58.104 --> 06:00.339
- Until recently, he was
wearing a different watch.

06:03.943 --> 06:07.879
- So he's on the street,
it's late night.

06:10.116 --> 06:11.717
Shooter takes cash
from the wallet,

06:11.718 --> 06:14.086
leaves the wallet to make it
look like a robbery.

06:16.489 --> 06:20.960
I think our guy here
was ambushed.

06:20.961 --> 06:23.929
- Last night, David had dinner
at le chat blanc.

06:23.930 --> 06:26.665
- Do you know who with?
- It was personal.

06:26.666 --> 06:29.668
He mostly kept
his private life to himself.

06:29.669 --> 06:32.538
- Who did he work
most closely with?

06:32.539 --> 06:35.007
- Aston Skinner.
He was David's number two.

06:35.008 --> 06:37.443
But he's out of the office,
traveling.

06:37.444 --> 06:41.313
- David kellen,
"the merger king."

06:41.314 --> 06:45.584
It's a competitive
environment.

06:45.585 --> 06:47.553
Is there any reason
to think

06:47.554 --> 06:50.956
that the killing had something
to do with his work?

06:50.957 --> 06:53.092
- No.

06:53.093 --> 06:55.661
- You said he kept
his private life private.

06:55.662 --> 06:58.564
Do you know anything
about girlfriends, lovers?

06:58.565 --> 07:00.566
- He never shared
that stuff with me.

07:00.567 --> 07:02.634
But over the last
few months,

07:02.635 --> 07:04.136
he was acting different.

07:04.137 --> 07:05.371
- Different how?

07:05.372 --> 07:08.107
- He wasn't putting in
those 20-hour days.

07:08.108 --> 07:11.243
He seemed happy.

07:11.244 --> 07:13.045
- Study guide to proust.

07:13.046 --> 07:14.713
- He brought it in
to work yesterday.

07:14.714 --> 07:15.981
Didn't say why.

07:15.982 --> 07:18.050
- I tried proust in college.

07:18.051 --> 07:20.953
I gave up after
the first million pages.

07:20.954 --> 07:24.623
- It picks up after
the second million pages.

07:27.260 --> 07:29.495
- Mr. kellen,
he was here with a woman,

07:29.496 --> 07:30.829
like always.

07:30.830 --> 07:32.297
- Any idea who she was?

07:32.298 --> 07:34.833
- No. Stunning.
Model-gorgeous.

07:34.834 --> 07:37.369
Early 30s.
Her legs went on forever.

07:37.370 --> 07:39.104
Good to be rich.

07:39.105 --> 07:40.739
- Unless, of course,
you're dead.

07:40.740 --> 07:42.541
- Right. Sorry.

07:42.542 --> 07:45.878
- Aside from legs
that go on forever,

07:45.879 --> 07:47.479
do you remember
anything else?

07:47.480 --> 07:49.214
Name? Accent? Scars?

07:49.215 --> 07:50.382
- As they were walking out,

07:50.383 --> 07:51.784
I think I heard him
call her "doctor."

07:51.785 --> 07:53.252
She said something to him
in French.

07:53.253 --> 07:56.889
I'm rusty, but I think it was
<i>"le temps recherche."</i>

07:56.890 --> 07:58.624
<i>- Le temps retrouve?</i>

07:58.625 --> 08:00.692
Marcel proust-
"the past recaptured."

08:00.693 --> 08:03.328
- Yes, that's what she said.

08:03.329 --> 08:05.431
- Okay, thanks.

08:05.432 --> 08:08.167
David's number two,
Aston Skinner,

08:08.168 --> 08:10.502
he's back in town.

08:10.503 --> 08:12.404
- I zipped back from southampton
the minute I heard.

08:12.405 --> 08:13.806
- You were in southampton
last night?

08:13.807 --> 08:15.007
- Yes.

08:15.008 --> 08:19.011
- David's last call
was to you at 11:29 p.M.

08:19.012 --> 08:23.048
- You know that we can recover
deleted messages, right?

08:23.049 --> 08:26.885
- And obstructing a murder
investigation is a felony.

08:26.886 --> 08:31.256
- Yes, David called me.
He was upset.

08:31.257 --> 08:32.791
He said that I was
a dead man.

08:32.792 --> 08:34.559
- A dead man?

08:34.561 --> 08:35.961
- Yeah. Sounds ominous,
I know,

08:35.962 --> 08:37.596
but it's just David
being David.

08:37.597 --> 08:39.364
He liked to talk
like a tough guy.

08:39.365 --> 08:41.133
- Can you elaborate?

08:41.134 --> 08:42.433
- He thought I was
in southampton

08:42.434 --> 08:44.336
meeting his top client,
trying to develop

08:44.337 --> 08:46.004
my own personal relationship.

08:46.005 --> 08:48.607
He got pissed, he left
that ridiculous message.

08:48.608 --> 08:50.242
- And what were you doing
in southampton?

08:50.243 --> 08:52.478
- No, I was meeting
his top client,

08:52.479 --> 08:54.713
trying to develop my own
personal relationship.

08:54.714 --> 08:56.215
- So you weren't friends.

08:56.216 --> 08:59.051
- We...Respected each other.

08:59.052 --> 09:00.953
We made a lot
of money together.

09:00.954 --> 09:03.822
Just last week we closed
a $34 billion acquisition

09:03.823 --> 09:05.124
of salton foods.

09:05.125 --> 09:07.259
- Congrats.

09:07.260 --> 09:08.894
Was he dating someone?

09:08.895 --> 09:11.430
A doctor, maybe?
- We only talked shop.

09:11.431 --> 09:14.032
- Now that David's dead,
I imagine that you've

09:14.033 --> 09:15.901
positioned yourself
fairly well.

09:15.902 --> 09:18.604
- Well, it's bittersweet,
of course,

09:18.605 --> 09:20.939
but I've been named CEO.

09:20.940 --> 09:24.543
The board made
their decision this morning.

09:26.345 --> 09:29.181
- According to the <i>journal,</i>
<i>David kellen grew up</i>

09:29.182 --> 09:30.649
on staten island.

09:30.650 --> 09:32.251
Father hauled trash,

09:32.252 --> 09:34.186
his mother worked
at a local diner.

09:34.187 --> 09:36.155
- He's a rich man.
He thinks he needs a woman

09:36.156 --> 09:38.490
with an a-list resume.

09:38.491 --> 09:40.492
- Got the warrant.
Found what you were looking for

09:40.493 --> 09:42.127
in David kellen's
dresser drawer.

09:42.128 --> 09:44.463
- Thanks, detective.

09:44.464 --> 09:48.167
Investment-grade.

09:48.168 --> 09:50.669
60 grand, right?
Square face.

09:50.670 --> 09:52.971
Looks like it would match
the tan line on his wrist.

09:52.972 --> 09:54.806
- It's still in working order.

09:54.807 --> 09:58.010
He made a choice
to wear the cheapie.

09:58.011 --> 10:00.979
- David kellen was a star.

10:00.980 --> 10:04.283
The CEOs of major
investment banks are worried

10:04.284 --> 10:06.451
that this is a calculated
attack on bankers.

10:06.452 --> 10:08.053
- Unlikely.

10:08.054 --> 10:09.621
He was on a date
with a woman

10:09.622 --> 10:12.090
he identified as "doctor."

10:12.091 --> 10:14.560
- A female doctor
in new York?

10:14.561 --> 10:18.497
There are 13 hospitals
in Manhattan alone.

10:18.498 --> 10:22.234
- She quoted him
a line in French-

10:22.235 --> 10:24.303
<i>le temps retrouve.</i>

10:24.304 --> 10:28.707
A section in proust's novel.

10:28.708 --> 10:33.011
Maybe she has a doctorate
in education, not medicine.

10:33.012 --> 10:37.983
- And how many French lit
professors have perfect legs?

10:37.984 --> 10:40.352
- We only had one date,
so I don't know much about him.

10:40.353 --> 10:42.221
But I could tell his mind
was somewhere else.

10:42.222 --> 10:44.289
- How did you meet?

10:44.290 --> 10:46.091
- Through a dating
consultant.

10:46.092 --> 10:48.093
- A matchmaker for rich guys?

10:48.094 --> 10:51.263
- Something like that.
It's called the swan club.

10:51.264 --> 10:53.599
A friend told me about
this woman who works

10:53.600 --> 10:55.100
with accomplished men.

10:55.101 --> 10:56.501
But it's all
very professional.

10:56.502 --> 10:58.870
I had to interview three times
before I was accepted.

10:58.871 --> 11:01.974
- The shooting's been
on the news, in the papers.

11:01.975 --> 11:03.609
Why didn't you come forward?

11:03.610 --> 11:05.811
- I was worried about
the attention.

11:05.812 --> 11:08.413
I didn't want people to know
I used a matchmaker.

11:08.414 --> 11:09.648
It's embarrassing.

11:09.649 --> 11:10.916
It makes me look like
I'm only interested

11:10.917 --> 11:12.050
in dating rich men.

11:12.051 --> 11:14.353
- You said his mind was
somewhere else.

11:14.354 --> 11:16.855
Do you know where?
- I don't know.

11:16.856 --> 11:19.291
But the highlight was definitely
his ex-girlfriend

11:19.292 --> 11:20.659
stopping by our table.

11:20.660 --> 11:24.630
- What'd she say?

11:24.631 --> 11:27.165
- She made a joke about him
pretending to be spiritual,

11:27.166 --> 11:28.367
or something like that.

11:28.368 --> 11:29.968
She even followed him
into the bathroom.

11:35.174 --> 11:38.844
- The swan club is
a high-Echelon marriage broker.

11:38.845 --> 11:44.016
Clients pay an annual retainer
of $200,000,

11:44.017 --> 11:46.084
and if a client marries
one of my girls,

11:46.085 --> 11:48.220
I get a $500,000
success fee.

11:48.221 --> 11:51.490
Some people think
it's unseemly,

11:51.491 --> 11:54.593
but why shouldn't
your soul mate be vetted

11:54.594 --> 11:56.328
by a professional?

11:56.329 --> 11:58.497
- Because it's soulless?

11:58.498 --> 12:02.067
- How many women did you
introduce David to?

12:02.068 --> 12:04.803
- Oh, a dozen or so
over the last year.

12:04.804 --> 12:08.006
And every one of them
amazing.

12:08.007 --> 12:10.609
- "Came from humble roots."

12:10.610 --> 12:13.011
How do you deal with those
Ivy league runway models-

12:13.012 --> 12:16.448
you know, with their doctorates
and their trust funds?

12:16.449 --> 12:19.318
- When it came to women,
poor David was strange.

12:19.319 --> 12:22.020
He always complained that
he didn't <i>feel it.</i>

12:22.021 --> 12:26.058
His longest relationship,
by far, was with Nikki vansen.

12:26.059 --> 12:27.726
It was three months.

12:27.727 --> 12:29.895
She was shocked
when he broke it off.

12:29.896 --> 12:31.963
He didn't explain why.

12:31.964 --> 12:35.634
- Okay, uh, thank you,
Ms. Miller.

12:35.635 --> 12:37.636
- Oh, well,
you're very, very welcome.

12:37.637 --> 12:39.604
You know, if you're ever
in the market for a date,

12:39.605 --> 12:41.606
I'd be happy to put you
in our database.

12:41.607 --> 12:43.475
- Oh...

12:43.476 --> 12:47.946
- Sorry, he can't afford
your meat market.

12:47.947 --> 12:51.483
- 12 pieces?
They said 14. What is this?

12:51.484 --> 12:54.552
Come on, I thought you were
gonna bring the same as before.

12:56.088 --> 13:00.125
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's okay, guys.

13:00.126 --> 13:02.761
- We need to talk.
- Sure.

13:02.762 --> 13:05.230
- My dad had absolutely nothing
to do with this!

13:05.231 --> 13:08.333
And you go beat him up?

13:08.334 --> 13:11.670
- So it was you.
- Yeah, it was me.

13:11.671 --> 13:13.004
- You know, you've been
going to bat

13:13.005 --> 13:14.973
for that welcher father of yours
since your mom died.

13:14.974 --> 13:18.410
- Yeah. And you've been
bleeding him this whole time.

13:21.313 --> 13:24.750
- Look, I swear
on my children's lives

13:24.751 --> 13:26.084
I had nothing to do
with this.

13:30.489 --> 13:32.124
- I saw David.

13:32.125 --> 13:33.925
Had dinner at le chat blanc
with a friend,

13:33.926 --> 13:36.161
and we bumped into
each other.

13:36.162 --> 13:38.497
- Did you talk to him?
- No, not really.

13:38.498 --> 13:41.867
Just said hi-could you not
talk to the actors, please?

13:41.868 --> 13:44.336
We gotta move.
- And after dinner?

13:44.337 --> 13:47.906
- I went home around 10:30.

13:47.907 --> 13:49.574
- Was there a specific reason
you two broke up?

13:49.575 --> 13:52.577
- Frankly, I'm too busy
making this movie for universal,

13:52.578 --> 13:55.080
and he was too busy
making deals in London.

13:55.081 --> 13:57.716
It goes that way sometimes.

13:57.717 --> 13:58.884
Looks like
our next shot's up.

13:58.885 --> 14:00.252
I hope I've been helpful,
detectives.

14:00.253 --> 14:02.554
- You have. No, you have.

14:02.555 --> 14:05.223
Except for the lie.

14:05.224 --> 14:08.059
His date Andrea told us

14:08.060 --> 14:09.995
you followed David
into the bathroom.

14:09.996 --> 14:14.332
- Can anyone confirm
you were home at 10:30?

14:14.333 --> 14:17.202
- Yes, someone can confirm
I was home at 10:30.

14:17.203 --> 14:19.070
- Who?
- My boyfriend.

14:19.071 --> 14:20.272
- New boyfriend already?

14:20.273 --> 14:22.574
- Swim fast or die.
- What's his name?

14:22.575 --> 14:26.444
- Aston Skinner.
David's number two.

14:31.528 --> 14:33.228
You told us you
took your boss's job,

14:33.229 --> 14:34.396
but you didn't bother
to tell us

14:34.397 --> 14:36.365
you also merged
with his girlfriend.

14:36.366 --> 14:38.567
- Oh, I didn't realize
I had an obligation

14:38.568 --> 14:40.769
to disclose the names
of my sexual partners.

14:40.770 --> 14:42.637
- You do when she's
the angry ex

14:42.638 --> 14:45.440
and you're taking over
the dead guy's office.

14:45.441 --> 14:49.978
- I can assure you
that I didn't kill David Kellen.

14:49.979 --> 14:51.613
- And you're sure that
you weren't a little bit upset

14:51.614 --> 14:52.848
over David trying
to fire you?

14:52.849 --> 14:55.150
I subpoenaed
your general counsel.

14:55.151 --> 14:57.552
They told me that
David tried to have you fired

14:57.553 --> 14:59.588
over the salton food merger

14:59.589 --> 15:01.923
- our accounting department
alerted David

15:01.924 --> 15:04.659
to possible insider trading
on the salton merger.

15:04.660 --> 15:06.595
He accused me
of being the leak.

15:06.596 --> 15:08.397
- Were you?
- Of course not.

15:08.398 --> 15:11.266
The trade in question
is nothing...$70,000.

15:11.267 --> 15:14.736
When David tried to boot me,
the board told him to shove it,

15:14.737 --> 15:16.638
gave me a new deal.

15:16.639 --> 15:18.306
I had no reason
to kill him.

15:18.307 --> 15:21.443
- So who wanted to hurt David?

15:21.444 --> 15:24.179
- Everybody on his rolodex?

15:24.180 --> 15:27.716
Look, David printed money
when he made these deals.

15:27.717 --> 15:29.384
But if anybody messed
with him,

15:29.385 --> 15:33.088
lied, tried to cheat him,
he pushed back. Hard.

15:33.089 --> 15:36.825
As I said,
he liked to talk tough.

15:36.826 --> 15:38.827
- I'll have a forensic
accountant

15:38.828 --> 15:40.896
check the principals'
trading activity

15:40.897 --> 15:42.164
in the salton foods deal.

15:42.165 --> 15:44.166
- Skinner snatches
David's job and girlfriend

15:44.167 --> 15:45.367
in one fell swoop.

15:45.368 --> 15:46.935
He got the job because
he was number two,

15:46.936 --> 15:49.070
but how'd he get the girl?

15:49.071 --> 15:50.605
- No, I do not set up
one client

15:50.606 --> 15:52.507
with another client's
castoffs.

15:52.508 --> 15:54.676
Nikki met Aston Skinner

15:54.677 --> 15:56.912
while she was in a relationship
with David.

15:56.913 --> 16:01.316
And when David dropped her,
she gravitated to Aston.

16:01.317 --> 16:03.952
- So competition
between he and David

16:03.953 --> 16:06.455
was fierce on every level.

16:06.456 --> 16:09.524
- And either way, you collect
the 500k matrimonial bonus.

16:09.525 --> 16:14.029
- What can I say?
I've always been a romantic.

16:14.030 --> 16:17.599
- You've established
a very clear motive

16:17.600 --> 16:20.335
as to why Skinner would have
killed David Kellen.

16:20.336 --> 16:22.571
Love and money.
- You're not getting it.

16:22.572 --> 16:26.608
Aston and David were not
in competition for women.

16:26.609 --> 16:28.877
David was not interested
in Nikki.

16:28.878 --> 16:31.279
She told me that he dumped her
for someone else.

16:31.280 --> 16:33.582
- She say who?

16:33.583 --> 16:35.717
- Uh, some teacher
in inwood.

16:40.055 --> 16:43.024
- We met at Louie's
charcoal pit diner.

16:43.025 --> 16:47.128
I had a client on the hill,
where the rich people live.

16:47.129 --> 16:49.197
He came in.

16:49.198 --> 16:51.399
I was at the counter,
talking to my friend Sally,

16:51.400 --> 16:56.137
and we just, uh...
Connected.

16:56.138 --> 16:59.007
- Vanessa,
you live in inwood.

16:59.008 --> 17:00.442
- 218th street.

17:00.443 --> 17:02.310
- Last street in Manhattan...

17:02.311 --> 17:05.480
Where the Hudson meets
the east river.

17:05.481 --> 17:08.083
- How long did
you and David date?

17:08.084 --> 17:11.051
- Uh, two months.

17:11.053 --> 17:13.221
I think I was
too ordinary for him.

17:13.222 --> 17:15.891
- When was the last time
you saw him?

17:15.892 --> 17:18.159
- A week or two
before he died.

17:18.160 --> 17:21.061
He took me out for coffee,
said it wasn't gonna work out.

17:21.063 --> 17:23.031
- That must have been
tough to take.

17:23.031 --> 17:24.833
A guy with that kind
of money.

17:24.834 --> 17:26.768
- Well, I didn't get
the cover of <i>vogue.</i>

17:26.769 --> 17:29.336
I'm a regular girl.

17:29.337 --> 17:32.940
- And he was a regular guy
from staten island.

17:32.941 --> 17:34.975
- Was that the attraction
for him?

17:34.976 --> 17:37.678
- Probably.

17:37.679 --> 17:40.648
But that faded fast,
I think.

17:40.649 --> 17:45.519
I'm just-
I'm sad he's dead.

17:45.520 --> 17:49.023
- Where were you the night
David was killed?

17:49.024 --> 17:50.825
- Working in my father's bar.

17:50.826 --> 17:52.293
Check the cameras
if you want.

17:52.294 --> 17:55.362
- Okay. Thanks, Vanessa.
- Thanks.

17:55.363 --> 17:57.998
Does it feel weird
to be home?

17:57.999 --> 17:59.800
- I went to school here.

17:59.801 --> 18:02.069
It's smaller
than I remember.

18:02.070 --> 18:04.638
- Here's my plan. I'm gonna
knock out that back wall.

18:04.639 --> 18:06.307
That'll double
the size of this place.

18:06.308 --> 18:08.309
Be able to do weddings,
wakes-

18:08.310 --> 18:10.211
maybe even a black-tie gala.
- Nice.

18:10.212 --> 18:11.679
- Was your daughter
working here

18:11.680 --> 18:13.314
the night of the 24th?

18:13.315 --> 18:16.417
- Yeah. My daughter works here
every night but Sunday.

18:16.418 --> 18:19.153
- Is there some surveillance
footage we could look at?

18:19.154 --> 18:22.089
- Joanne called.
She just quit.

18:22.090 --> 18:23.491
- You got glaucoma?

18:23.492 --> 18:25.626
You see I'm talking
with the detectives?

18:27.795 --> 18:28.996
Sorry about that.

18:28.997 --> 18:31.232
- It's tough running
a business.

18:31.233 --> 18:33.167
- Yeah, tell me about it.

18:33.168 --> 18:36.237
- You running a little book
to make ends meet?

18:36.238 --> 18:39.039
You're lucky we're not vice.

18:39.040 --> 18:44.044
- You know, this renovation's
gonna take a lot of dough.

18:44.045 --> 18:45.846
How 'bout I show you
that video, huh?

18:45.847 --> 18:46.947
Come on.

18:48.883 --> 18:51.151
Terrible thing about
that guy getting killed.

18:51.152 --> 18:52.920
Vanessa told me
she was involved with somebody,

18:52.921 --> 18:54.188
but she never mentioned
anything

18:54.189 --> 18:55.723
about him having
any dough.

18:55.724 --> 18:58.392
- No mention?
- Come on.

18:58.393 --> 19:00.528
What's the chances of a girl
telling her dad anything

19:00.529 --> 19:01.795
about a guy she's seeing

19:01.796 --> 19:03.531
until he slips a ring
on her finger?

19:03.532 --> 19:07.201
But she seemed,
you know, happy.

19:07.202 --> 19:10.538
- How did she react when
she heard David was dead?

19:10.539 --> 19:11.872
- She was devastated.

19:11.873 --> 19:15.376
But I told her pray for him
and move on.

19:15.377 --> 19:17.745
Show friendship for a man
when he's alive,

19:17.746 --> 19:19.847
not after he's dead.

19:19.848 --> 19:22.416
- F. Scott Fitzgerald.

19:22.417 --> 19:26.286
- Yeah.
I knew I liked you.

19:28.356 --> 19:29.790
- What do we know about
the teacher from inwood?

19:29.791 --> 19:32.359
- Worked at her father's bar
until 1:30 A.M.

19:32.360 --> 19:33.494
The night of the murder.

19:33.495 --> 19:35.329
We saw videotape.

19:35.330 --> 19:37.164
And architectural drawings
of his new

19:37.165 --> 19:40.601
live-music venue...
Supper club.

19:40.602 --> 19:43.170
- Bless the dreamers.
Who else is in the mix?

19:43.171 --> 19:45.272
- Ask me, the leader
in the clubhouse

19:45.273 --> 19:46.640
is Aston Skinner.

19:46.641 --> 19:49.209
He alibis out in the Hamptons,
but it's not hard

19:49.210 --> 19:50.945
to hire a shooter
with his kind of dough.

19:50.946 --> 19:53.047
- Got a holler
from midtown north.

19:53.048 --> 19:54.815
Some square-John citizen says

19:54.816 --> 19:56.383
that he saw who shot
David Kellen.

19:59.187 --> 20:02.056
- So, Mr. connelley, you ided
the shooter as female.

20:02.057 --> 20:06.627
Recognize any of these women
as the person you saw?

20:06.628 --> 20:10.030
Her.

20:10.031 --> 20:11.732
You're sure?

20:11.733 --> 20:16.303
Not sure...Positive.

20:20.863 --> 20:23.148
Our witness said
he saw you under the awning

20:23.183 --> 20:25.433
of the remsen building
on little W. 12th street.

20:25.434 --> 20:29.369
a 38.

20:29.370 --> 20:31.904
The same caliber used
to kill David Kellen.

20:31.905 --> 20:34.540
- That's insane.
- He I.D.Ed your picture.

20:34.541 --> 20:35.908
- I don't even own a gun!

20:35.909 --> 20:38.377
- You despised David
for breaking up with you.

20:38.378 --> 20:41.614
You were at the same restaurant
the night of the murder.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.116
Yes, I was.

20:43.117 --> 20:45.318
- And the problem with Aston's
alibi for your whereabouts

20:45.319 --> 20:49.121
is that he was
in southampton that night.

20:50.857 --> 20:54.360
- Okay, I lied.

20:54.361 --> 20:56.496
I was embarrassed I went
to the restaurant.

20:56.497 --> 20:57.796
But I didn't kill him.

21:01.902 --> 21:05.004
- Fine.
So you're innocent.

21:05.005 --> 21:08.541
Who, other than you and Aston,
had a motive to kill David?

21:08.542 --> 21:12.145
- That girl from inwood...

21:12.146 --> 21:14.147
Vanessa...
Whatever her name is.

21:14.148 --> 21:16.315
- Why would Vanessa
do that?

21:16.316 --> 21:18.518
- A) Because she's white trash.

21:18.519 --> 21:21.153
B) Because he dumped her,
just like he dumped me.

21:23.623 --> 21:27.660
- She hates him, but I
don't think she killed him.

21:27.661 --> 21:30.496
- You say David leveled
an insider-trading allegation

21:30.497 --> 21:33.599
against her new boyfriend
for the salton foods deal.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.701
So you got motive.

21:35.702 --> 21:38.437
And opportunity, she stalked him
to the restaurant.

21:38.438 --> 21:42.475
- Her version of revenge
is raising a ruckus in public,

21:42.476 --> 21:44.877
shacking up with Skinner...

21:44.878 --> 21:48.614
Not shooting a guy
on little west 12th.

21:48.615 --> 21:53.419
Which casts doubt on
our witness, Mr. connelley.

21:53.420 --> 21:55.988
- When a witness seems
too good to be true,

21:55.989 --> 21:58.557
he usually is.

22:01.962 --> 22:03.196
- Michael connelley.
Grew up in the bronx.

22:03.197 --> 22:04.597
Lives on the upper east side.

22:04.598 --> 22:07.333
Married. Sells software
for some tech company

22:07.334 --> 22:08.501
based in palo alto.

22:08.502 --> 22:10.803
- Jacket?
- Clean as a whistle.

22:10.804 --> 22:12.238
- Sounds pretty honest
for someone

22:12.239 --> 22:14.440
who waited two days to tell
the truth about a murder.

22:14.441 --> 22:16.309
Any connection
to Vanessa?

22:16.310 --> 22:18.811
- Nothing obvious, anyway.
But he is connected to Inwood.

22:18.812 --> 22:21.447
- Really?
- His brother Greg lives there.

22:21.448 --> 22:22.648
Bunch of junkie busts.

22:22.649 --> 22:25.117
Contacted narcotics.
I'll dig up more.

22:25.118 --> 22:27.553
- Maybe Mr. squeaky clean
is doing his brother

22:27.554 --> 22:29.989
or someone his brother owes
a favor.

22:29.990 --> 22:32.891
- Either way,
all roads lead uptown.

22:45.605 --> 22:47.607
- Hey.

22:47.608 --> 22:50.142
What's the matter, angel?

22:50.143 --> 22:53.246
- I never wanted him
to die.

22:53.247 --> 22:55.514
- What does that
got to do with you?

22:57.250 --> 22:59.118
- Nothing.

22:59.119 --> 23:03.389
- Sweetie, David Kellen was
from a different world. Hmm?

23:03.390 --> 23:07.260
My advice to you is...
Stick to home.

23:07.261 --> 23:09.228
This way you don't get hurt.

23:09.229 --> 23:10.630
Hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

23:10.631 --> 23:13.132
- Gotta go.

23:17.504 --> 23:19.605
- This place used to be called
Mr. k's.

23:19.606 --> 23:22.475
Cherry popsicles were
a quarter.

23:22.476 --> 23:26.512
And Danny quinlan dumped me
right there in front of moran's.

23:26.513 --> 23:28.214
- Not for being ordinary.

23:28.215 --> 23:30.516
- For kissing Nick Farrell
at recess.

23:30.517 --> 23:34.020
- Ooh, lucky Nicky!

23:34.021 --> 23:35.755
- Michael connelley-
I've never heard of him.

23:35.756 --> 23:38.124
- What about his brother Greg?

23:38.125 --> 23:40.660
He lives two blocks away
from you.

23:40.661 --> 23:43.129
- No. Why?

23:43.130 --> 23:46.499
- Well, Michael said he saw
who shot David.

23:46.500 --> 23:49.535
But now,
both Michael connelley

23:49.536 --> 23:51.704
and his brother Greg
are in the wind.

23:51.705 --> 23:53.973
- Yeah, I told you,
I don't know them.

23:53.974 --> 23:56.909
- Kinda weird that
the brother of a guy

23:56.910 --> 23:59.412
who lives two blocks away
I.D.S the shooter...

23:59.413 --> 24:04.016
- A woman who also
dated David.

24:04.017 --> 24:06.385
He dumped you
for being regular.

24:06.386 --> 24:08.421
Which is really just
another way of saying

24:08.422 --> 24:09.889
white trash from inwood.

24:09.890 --> 24:12.391
- Well, I gotta go.

24:12.392 --> 24:14.994
Happy hour starts
in 30 minutes.

24:14.995 --> 24:17.697
- What was your prize
out the door?

24:17.698 --> 24:19.632
A tee shirt that said

24:19.633 --> 24:22.335
"I got dumped
by a master of the universe"?

24:22.336 --> 24:25.504
- Hmm. Well, you've clearly
been hurt by men.

24:25.505 --> 24:27.740
- This is not about me.

24:27.741 --> 24:31.043
- Listen,
David was a good man.

24:31.044 --> 24:33.079
Kind and decent.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.481
And you're not gonna get me
to crap on his memory.

24:35.482 --> 24:37.616
I'm done talking.

24:41.421 --> 24:43.556
- She had a chance
to bag on him, and she didn't.

24:43.557 --> 24:45.858
- Even more,
she defended him.

24:45.859 --> 24:48.461
- She's talking about
how great he is.

24:48.462 --> 24:50.896
Did you notice she didn't ask
any questions about the murder?

24:50.897 --> 24:53.632
She knows more
than she's letting on.

24:53.633 --> 24:55.201
- Eames.

24:55.202 --> 24:57.336
Okay, thanks.

24:57.337 --> 24:59.472
They found our witness,
Michael Connelley.

24:59.473 --> 25:03.509
Someone shot him
execution style,

25:03.510 --> 25:06.912
dumped him in the river
at tubby hook.

25:06.913 --> 25:08.948
Abrasions make me think
they chained him,

25:08.949 --> 25:11.450
but his body slipped loose,
and he floated.

25:11.451 --> 25:14.620
Tubby hook's the harbor
at inwood.

25:14.621 --> 25:17.890
There's no place
like home.

25:22.206 --> 25:23.906
Checked with Inwood Division.

25:23.907 --> 25:27.043
Michael Connelley's brother Greg
worked for some lowlife

25:27.044 --> 25:28.744
named Jack Driscoll.

25:28.745 --> 25:32.214
- Jack is listed as a suspect
involved in crimes

25:32.215 --> 25:35.718
like extortion,
loan sharking, and murder.

25:35.719 --> 25:38.020
- Finally, a suspect I like.

25:38.021 --> 25:41.257
Bring him in, have a chat.

25:41.258 --> 25:43.592
- I don't know anyone
named David Kellen.

25:43.593 --> 25:46.228
Wall street...

25:46.229 --> 25:48.998
The farthest south I go
is Washington heights.

25:48.999 --> 25:51.400
- You know Shawn colway?
- Yeah.

25:51.401 --> 25:53.035
Of course. An old pal.

25:53.036 --> 25:54.370
He owns a bar.

25:54.371 --> 25:56.672
- Runs a little book
on the side.

25:56.673 --> 25:59.041
- Yeah. That's inwood.

25:59.042 --> 26:02.211
- Maybe he got in a jam,
you lent him some money.

26:02.212 --> 26:05.281
- There's rapists and killers
out there

26:05.282 --> 26:06.782
who would love to know
that a friendly loan

26:06.783 --> 26:08.684
qualifies as major case.

26:08.685 --> 26:10.486
Besides, he settled up.

26:10.487 --> 26:13.222
- It's major case
because David Kellen

26:13.223 --> 26:17.526
took two in the chest
on little w. 12th street.

26:17.527 --> 26:21.397
- Oh, yeah.
I heard about that.

26:21.398 --> 26:23.399
- Did you know that
Shawn colway's daughter

26:23.400 --> 26:24.567
was dating him?

26:24.568 --> 26:27.169
- Vanessa?
- Mm-hmm.

26:27.170 --> 26:29.772
- Get out.
- No, they were lovers.

26:29.773 --> 26:32.508
- Wow. Well, good for her.

26:32.509 --> 26:36.779
Better the merger king
than Vinnie scrivarni from 215.

26:36.780 --> 26:38.314
- So you don't know Kellen,

26:38.315 --> 26:40.850
but you know that
he was called "the merger king"?

26:40.851 --> 26:43.552
- Yeah. I can read,
detective.

26:43.553 --> 26:45.888
It's in the <i>po</i> every day.

26:45.889 --> 26:49.258
- Right.

26:49.259 --> 26:52.161
Right.

26:52.162 --> 26:54.129
Good.

27:00.437 --> 27:03.606
You know, I saw
that you've invested

27:03.607 --> 27:06.175
in legitimate businesses.

27:06.176 --> 27:09.478
You know, garbage hauling,
trucking, meat packing.

27:09.479 --> 27:11.313
You know, it's funny
how guys in those fields,

27:11.314 --> 27:13.048
they get tagged
with the ugly stuff

27:13.049 --> 27:14.817
like extortion, loan sharking,
you know.

27:14.818 --> 27:17.653
I don't think it's fair.
- Yeah, I agree.

27:17.654 --> 27:19.555
- You're a sophisticated
businessman.

27:19.556 --> 27:22.091
- Very.
- You have an understanding-

27:22.092 --> 27:23.559
mergers, acquisitions.

27:23.560 --> 27:25.327
You know, when it's right
for one company

27:25.328 --> 27:27.663
to take over
another company.

27:27.664 --> 27:29.031
- No, not me.

27:29.032 --> 27:30.966
I stick to betting
the over/under on the jets.

27:30.967 --> 27:34.103
- You bet on stocks?

27:34.104 --> 27:35.737
Salton foods?

27:39.476 --> 27:42.611
We have forensic accountants
looking into an allegation

27:42.612 --> 27:44.280
of insider trading.

27:44.281 --> 27:46.014
- I want my lawyer.

27:53.790 --> 27:56.125
- This guy <i>breathes</i>
<i>douche bag.</i>

27:56.126 --> 27:59.295
- Never spent a day in lockup.
Made him cocky.

27:59.296 --> 28:01.664
- Why didn't you bring up
our dead witness Connelley?

28:01.665 --> 28:04.934
- We think that Driscoll
used him as an alibi,

28:04.935 --> 28:06.469
and then knocked him off
when he thought that

28:06.470 --> 28:09.104
Connelley would admit being
a false witness.

28:09.105 --> 28:11.373
We're working on
a different angle.

28:11.374 --> 28:12.808
- Do tell.

28:12.809 --> 28:16.545
- We need Driscoll's motive
for killing David Kellen.

28:16.546 --> 28:19.949
- Jack Driscoll? The name
sounds vaguely familiar.

28:19.950 --> 28:23.152
- Yeah, he's into the game
of loans and protection.

28:23.153 --> 28:27.122
You know, someone-
a guy with expansion dreams

28:27.123 --> 28:29.558
might want to
do business with.

28:29.559 --> 28:32.461
- No, he's into meat.
I'm into booze.

28:32.462 --> 28:37.233
- How much do you owe Driscoll?

28:37.234 --> 28:39.134
- Do you see us standing here?
We're detectives.

28:39.135 --> 28:42.037
You see us? This is
a murder investigation.

28:42.038 --> 28:44.740
And you're running book
in this bar.

28:47.777 --> 28:51.747
- 70 grand.

28:51.748 --> 28:54.350
- That's interesting.

28:54.351 --> 28:55.751
'Cause Driscoll told us
you settled up.

28:55.752 --> 28:57.253
- Who's lying, you or him?

28:57.254 --> 28:59.788
- I'm not a snitch.

28:59.789 --> 29:02.491
I'm not saying nothin'.

29:05.461 --> 29:09.532
- It turns out that
he's a drunk, he's a gambler.

29:09.533 --> 29:11.100
You know, she does everything
for him,

29:11.101 --> 29:12.701
he does nothing for her.

29:12.702 --> 29:15.070
He's not a parent.

29:15.071 --> 29:16.438
- You're angry at him.

29:16.439 --> 29:18.807
- Well, the guy's a user!

29:18.808 --> 29:21.643
You know?
He's a piece of-

29:25.348 --> 29:28.050
sorry.
- Don't be.

29:28.051 --> 29:31.720
It's a tell. He presses
a lot of your buttons. Why>

29:31.721 --> 29:36.625
- you think that
he represents my father?

29:36.626 --> 29:37.960
- Do I?

29:37.961 --> 29:40.329
We haven't talked
about your father.

29:40.330 --> 29:42.598
- He's in my file,
isn't he?

29:42.599 --> 29:45.100
- No, not much.
Only that he's deceased.

29:45.101 --> 29:48.203
- Well, then, there's not
much to talk about.

29:48.204 --> 29:49.505
I mean, he's long gone.

29:49.506 --> 29:51.240
You know,
he didn't really father me.

29:51.241 --> 29:54.910
- How do you mean?

29:54.911 --> 29:56.645
- I did some handiwork
around the house

29:56.646 --> 29:59.515
when the husband
wasn't there.

29:59.516 --> 30:01.350
Which was often.

30:01.351 --> 30:06.822
- Nothing. It's just...

30:06.823 --> 30:08.857
He would go away,
which was often.

30:08.858 --> 30:12.595
And when he was around,
he was a charming man.

30:12.596 --> 30:13.696
Loved a good time.

30:13.697 --> 30:16.031
- How so?

30:16.032 --> 30:18.133
- He used to take me
to ball games, hockey.

30:18.134 --> 30:20.369
- Sounds like fun.

30:20.370 --> 30:22.805
- Didn't actually
take me to games.

30:22.806 --> 30:24.974
He took me
to this woman's house.

30:24.975 --> 30:27.710
Maggie's-
to her apartment.

30:27.711 --> 30:29.645
You know,
I would watch the game

30:29.646 --> 30:31.347
in front of a big
color tv,

30:31.348 --> 30:33.849
and he would, you know-

30:33.850 --> 30:36.885
he would go into the bedroom
with her.

30:41.090 --> 30:44.526
I remember the first time
that he took me there.

30:44.527 --> 30:49.565
On the way back,
he stopped to buy us some ices.

30:49.566 --> 30:51.567
And he told me,
"let's just keep this

30:51.568 --> 30:53.369
between us men, okay, Bobby?"

30:53.370 --> 30:55.871
- He had you cover for him?
- Yeah.

30:55.872 --> 30:58.474
- Do you remember how
that felt?

30:58.475 --> 31:01.310
- Lying to my mother?
I got used to it.

31:01.311 --> 31:05.147
- Okay.
How does it feel now?

31:07.316 --> 31:10.653
- Well, uh...

31:10.654 --> 31:14.556
My father taught me
an important lesson.

31:14.557 --> 31:17.226
Everybody lies
all the time.

31:17.227 --> 31:18.727
- You don't really
believe that.

31:18.728 --> 31:21.263
- I do!

31:21.264 --> 31:24.933
It's one of those
early survival skills.

31:24.934 --> 31:28.871
It serves me well
in my ]Ork.

31:28.872 --> 31:31.273
- Actually, in your work,
some people lie,

31:31.274 --> 31:33.742
and some people don't.

31:33.743 --> 31:35.611
And you figure out
who's who.

31:35.612 --> 31:38.480
- No, I try.
And sometimes I believe people,

31:38.481 --> 31:42.518
even though
they could be lying.

31:42.519 --> 31:44.453
- Your work isn't
the only place

31:44.454 --> 31:47.155
that you've applied
this lesson, is it?

31:50.993 --> 31:54.129
- I mean,
do you ever get tired

31:54.130 --> 31:57.632
of asking questions that
you know the answer to?

32:02.972 --> 32:04.740
- I'm sure we both do.

32:04.741 --> 32:07.376
- Then say what you mean.

32:07.377 --> 32:09.445
- Okay. Okay.

32:09.446 --> 32:15.384
When you tell yourself
everyone lies,

32:15.385 --> 32:16.919
that includes me.

32:16.920 --> 32:20.556
You're letting me know
that you can't trust me,

32:20.557 --> 32:23.392
that <i>i</i> lie to you.

32:23.393 --> 32:26.061
And you're putting
a distance between us.

32:28.131 --> 32:30.566
You may be right about me.
I hope you're not.

32:30.567 --> 32:34.503
But either way,
we both know

32:34.504 --> 32:37.773
it isn't the first time
that you've placed this rule

32:37.774 --> 32:41.910
around an intimate
relationship.

32:48.317 --> 32:50.686
- Thank you for your help,
Mr. eames.

32:50.687 --> 32:53.422
- Go easy, dad.

32:53.423 --> 32:56.158
- Jack Driscoll.
Hard case.

32:56.159 --> 32:57.993
He once beat a kid to death
with a wrench

32:57.994 --> 32:59.128
in broad daylight.

32:59.129 --> 33:00.896
Middle of the street.
20 people there.

33:00.897 --> 33:03.132
No one saw a thing.
He's a monster.

33:03.133 --> 33:05.834
- But smarter than he looks.

33:05.835 --> 33:08.403
- Just like you, Bobby.

33:08.404 --> 33:10.305
- Eat your sandwich.

33:10.306 --> 33:13.709
- It's amazing you can get
a corned beef sandwich

33:13.710 --> 33:16.512
with all the burrito
stands around.

33:16.513 --> 33:18.781
- Yes, everyone's out
to ruin

33:18.782 --> 33:20.115
the white man's paradise.

33:20.116 --> 33:23.318
- So, Driscoll, he never spent
a day in jail.

33:23.319 --> 33:26.388
- No one snitches.
You know that.

33:26.389 --> 33:28.056
When you know everyone,
you also know

33:28.057 --> 33:29.558
someone they care about.

33:29.559 --> 33:33.996
Driscoll knows everyone
and their half-brother.

33:33.997 --> 33:35.097
- What about you?

33:35.098 --> 33:38.333
- I got my daughter
to protect me.

33:38.334 --> 33:41.003
- I carry a gun.

33:41.004 --> 33:44.372
- And a badge.
But no grandchildren.

33:48.044 --> 33:49.978
- He has Irish Alzheimer's.

33:49.979 --> 33:52.681
Forgets everything
but the grudges.

33:52.682 --> 33:54.583
- It's good he has you.

33:54.584 --> 33:56.018
- Ye, whatever.

33:56.019 --> 33:57.486
They take care of you
when you're little,

33:57.487 --> 33:59.087
you care for them
when they're old.

33:59.088 --> 34:01.957
Circle of life.
Blah blah blah.

34:06.362 --> 34:08.163
- Uh, I think I know how

34:08.164 --> 34:09.731
the salton foods info
got leaked.

34:09.732 --> 34:11.699
We need to move before
someone else gets killed.

34:21.043 --> 34:22.978
- It's my father's bar!
- It's okay. She's his daughter.

34:26.415 --> 34:30.518
- What happened?
Where's my dad?

34:30.520 --> 34:33.388
- Your father was-

34:33.389 --> 34:35.224
- no.

34:35.225 --> 34:37.192
- We think
Jack Driscoll did it.

34:37.193 --> 34:42.097
I'm sorry. I am.

34:42.098 --> 34:44.867
And I'm even sorrier
that we have to do this now,

34:44.868 --> 34:47.502
but you need to answer
some questions.

34:49.572 --> 34:53.242
- The woman David Kellen
went to dinner with

34:53.243 --> 34:56.311
the night that he died...

34:56.312 --> 35:01.083
She told us that his mind
was on something else.

35:01.084 --> 35:05.020
- He did big deals.
Rome, London.

35:05.021 --> 35:07.656
- Yeah, I don't think
his mind was on London.

35:07.657 --> 35:11.526
I think it was on
the last street in Manhattan.

35:11.527 --> 35:14.162
When we found
David's body,

35:14.163 --> 35:17.599
he was wearing a $5,000 suit
and an $80 watch.

35:17.600 --> 35:24.006
Our officers searched
his $12 million pad

35:24.007 --> 35:28.443
and found a $60,000 watch
in his dresser drawer.

35:28.444 --> 35:35.017
Instead, he wore the one
that you got him.

35:35.018 --> 35:38.420
A regular watch
for regular people.

35:40.489 --> 35:43.425
- I really have to go.

35:45.361 --> 35:48.897
- You told us
when he broke up with you,

35:48.898 --> 35:52.968
it was because you were
too ordinary for him.

35:52.969 --> 35:56.405
But you bought him a watch.

35:56.406 --> 36:00.475
- As a parting gift.

36:00.476 --> 36:03.645
- No, I don't think so.

36:03.646 --> 36:07.316
David could have had
any girl he wanted,

36:07.317 --> 36:08.783
but he wanted you.

36:10.953 --> 36:13.555
You never broke up
with him, did you?

36:19.128 --> 36:22.965
- Uh, he said...

36:22.966 --> 36:26.535
The summer he was 14...

36:26.536 --> 36:31.974
He got all these seeds
from the burpee seed company,

36:31.975 --> 36:35.177
and he went door to door
selling seeds

36:35.178 --> 36:37.245
so he could
buy himself a watch.

36:39.415 --> 36:41.950
Can you imagine...

36:41.951 --> 36:46.488
Staten island covered
in marigolds?

36:50.026 --> 36:54.929
He got the watch, and
he lost the thing a year later.

36:58.134 --> 37:00.335
I love that story.

37:03.172 --> 37:06.074
So I got him a new one.

37:06.075 --> 37:10.479
I don't think
that's a crime.

37:10.480 --> 37:15.283
- Vanessa, we need to talk
about your dad.

37:17.586 --> 37:22.657
With all due respect,
he was a...A dreamer.

37:22.658 --> 37:25.994
He had big thoughts.
Jay gatsby big.

37:25.995 --> 37:28.597
He wanted to open
a night club.

37:28.598 --> 37:31.166
You know,
have black-tie galas.

37:31.167 --> 37:33.668
It's a curse to have
that many ideas.

37:33.669 --> 37:35.037
You need to take action.

37:35.038 --> 37:37.939
- And action takes money,
which he never had.

37:37.940 --> 37:40.942
So he had to borrow it.

37:40.943 --> 37:43.578
- Which gets complicated
when you borrow

37:43.579 --> 37:45.714
from a guy like
Jack Driscoll

37:45.715 --> 37:47.783
at seven points a week.

37:47.784 --> 37:54.089
Now, most people would run
from that...Complexity.

37:54.090 --> 37:55.791
Not you.

37:55.792 --> 37:58.693
- My-

37:58.694 --> 38:00.762
my mom died when I was 11.

38:03.265 --> 38:05.333
Dad was the only parent
I had.

38:05.334 --> 38:07.936
- You were the parent,
weren't you?

38:07.937 --> 38:10.338
I mean, you made sure
that he got up on time.

38:10.339 --> 38:12.741
You paid his overdue bills,
bought his groceries.

38:12.742 --> 38:15.844
- He needed me.

38:15.845 --> 38:19.013
- And how much did he need
this time, 70 grand?

38:21.317 --> 38:23.385
I mean, that's chicken feed
for a guy like David Kellen.

38:23.386 --> 38:26.154
He could peel that off
like I could peel off a fiver

38:26.155 --> 38:30.258
for a cup of coffee.

38:30.259 --> 38:31.460
You weren't gonna ask him
for money.

38:31.461 --> 38:33.395
You wouldn't do that,
would you?

38:33.396 --> 38:37.399
'Cause you didn't love David
for his money.

38:37.400 --> 38:40.302
And you didn't want to
compromise the relionship

38:40.303 --> 38:43.738
to make him think
you did.

38:43.739 --> 38:45.340
But at the same time,

38:45.341 --> 38:48.310
you didn't want
your father's kneecaps

38:48.311 --> 38:50.445
to be broken either.

38:50.446 --> 38:53.748
- We subpoenaed
Driscoll's phone records.

38:53.749 --> 38:56.384
A call was recorded
from your cell to his

38:56.385 --> 38:58.487
the week before
David's hedge fund

38:58.488 --> 39:00.789
acquired salton foods.

39:00.790 --> 39:03.558
- Is that how you paid back
the 70 grand your dad owed?

39:03.559 --> 39:04.993
- My dad had nothing
to do with this.

39:04.994 --> 39:07.129
- No, you fixed things
behind his back.

39:07.130 --> 39:09.197
That's what it was like
growing up

39:09.198 --> 39:12.300
and having to be the parent.

39:12.301 --> 39:13.568
- Did you overhear
phone conversations

39:13.569 --> 39:14.703
while you were together?

39:14.704 --> 39:18.440
See documents laying around?

39:18.441 --> 39:21.443
- It's barely illegal.
Just a stupid stock trade.

39:21.444 --> 39:24.312
Rich guys do it
all the time.

39:24.313 --> 39:27.449
Why couldn't you do it...
Just once...

39:27.450 --> 39:29.618
Just to save you father's life?

39:29.619 --> 39:35.557
- I was so naive to think
it would be a one-time thing.

39:35.558 --> 39:38.693
I should have known that
Driscoll was gonna see David

39:38.694 --> 39:40.929
as a golden goose.

39:43.165 --> 39:44.499
- And you betrayed the man
who loved you.

39:44.500 --> 39:46.701
- I know!

39:46.702 --> 39:49.237
- He picked you over all
the so-called

39:49.238 --> 39:53.909
<i>extraordinary</i> women.

39:53.910 --> 39:57.112
- I, um-

39:57.113 --> 40:02.918
I called Driscoll, and
I told him about salton foods.

40:02.919 --> 40:05.887
I know it was wrong
to do that.

40:05.888 --> 40:07.155
- Oh, I see, you confessed.

40:07.156 --> 40:09.191
You told him
you jeopardized his career

40:09.192 --> 40:10.992
to get your father
out of a jam.

40:10.993 --> 40:12.460
- Yes.

40:12.461 --> 40:17.999
I'm the one that told David,
not my dad.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.834
I'm the snitch.
You see?

40:19.835 --> 40:22.037
- I do.

40:22.038 --> 40:25.974
And David forgave you.

40:25.975 --> 40:28.577
But he wasn't gonna let you
fight this on your own.

40:28.578 --> 40:30.545
He's not the type,
you know.

40:30.546 --> 40:34.115
He threatens to make dead men
out of his business rivals.

40:34.116 --> 40:35.817
To a thug
who threatens his girl,

40:35.818 --> 40:38.386
he's gonna come on
pretty hard.

40:38.387 --> 40:41.890
So he unloaded
his tough talk on Driscoll,

40:41.891 --> 40:45.426
and Driscoll put two
in his chest.

40:48.197 --> 40:51.032
- I'm the reason
David's dead.

40:51.033 --> 40:54.703
- No, no.
You didn't kill David.

40:54.704 --> 40:58.106
Jack Driscoll killed David.

41:07.516 --> 41:10.918
- Tell me what
you need me to do.

41:34.510 --> 41:37.345
- There's something
we have to tell you.

41:39.415 --> 41:41.216
We hated doing something
like this,

41:41.217 --> 41:44.152
but I'm from inwood too,

41:44.153 --> 41:45.820
and we knew there was
only one way

41:45.821 --> 41:48.289
to get you
to tell the truth.

41:55.631 --> 41:58.066
- Dad?

41:58.067 --> 42:00.402
Dad.

42:02.738 --> 42:04.606
- Come on. It's all right.

42:04.607 --> 42:07.309
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

42:07.310 --> 42:08.677
- Daddy.
- Mm.

42:15.684 --> 42:17.552
- She tried to save
her father's life,

42:17.553 --> 42:20.055
and it cost David his.

42:20.056 --> 42:23.124
- Show me a hero and
I'll write you a tragedy.

42:23.125 --> 42:25.460
Fitzgerald.
