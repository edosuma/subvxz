00:43.308 --> 00:44.935
<i>I was born a baby. </i>

00:45.577 --> 00:47.101
<i>A blank slate. </i>

00:47.179 --> 00:50.148
<i>Thinking I was in control</i>
<i>of my own destiny. </i>

00:51.216 --> 00:53.684
<i>And then I met my father. </i>

00:55.788 --> 00:57.756
You better be good at this stuff.

00:58.090 --> 01:01.059
<i> In college, I wasn't</i>
<i>the most gifted athlete. </i>

01:01.460 --> 01:02.950
<i>But in order to</i>
<i>please my dad,</i>

01:03.028 --> 01:04.358
<i>I strived to be</i>
<i>the very best. </i>

01:04.430 --> 01:06.796
Oh. Little help,
already out of control.

01:06.865 --> 01:08.332
I'm losing vision,
it's blackness.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.425
You guys here, you might
want to move out of there,

01:10.502 --> 01:12.094
I gotta let go of this thing.

01:12.237 --> 01:14.705
Oh-oh.
Look out! For Pete's sake!

01:24.516 --> 01:25.881
How far was that?

01:28.120 --> 01:29.815
Foot and three inches.

01:30.589 --> 01:32.580
Hope you boys are ready.
See you at the finish line.

01:32.658 --> 01:35.183
There's a... There's
a rabid cheetah in Lane 2 here.

01:35.260 --> 01:38.195
Runners take your mark.
Get set!

01:39.731 --> 01:41.289
Hold on! Wait!

01:45.971 --> 01:48.565
I got it, right
below the knee, the nub.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.665
Oh, that hurts!

01:59.051 --> 02:01.383
No, no, no, no.
Your day's over, Phil.

02:02.688 --> 02:04.588
<i>Yes, I was quite the athlete. </i>

02:05.524 --> 02:06.513
Oh.

02:07.025 --> 02:08.822
<i>So much so,</i>
<i>that I caught the eye</i>

02:08.894 --> 02:10.691
<i>of the prettiest girl</i>
<i>in school. </i>

02:10.762 --> 02:12.059
Oh. Are you all right?

02:12.131 --> 02:13.098
Yeah.

02:13.165 --> 02:14.223
Sorry about that.

02:14.299 --> 02:15.857
Yeah, it's no prob.

02:16.135 --> 02:17.534
There's a horrible wind.

02:17.603 --> 02:19.400
Uh, no, there isn't.

02:20.272 --> 02:21.500
There is o-over there.

02:27.646 --> 02:30.843
Dad? Hey, Dad!
Barbara said "yes. "

02:30.916 --> 02:32.349
Hey, Son.

02:32.851 --> 02:34.751
This is Janice.
I met her at the A&P.

02:34.820 --> 02:35.718
Hi.

02:37.289 --> 02:38.722
We're gonna get married.

02:39.725 --> 02:41.352
Can I talk to you

02:41.860 --> 02:43.054
alone?

02:43.228 --> 02:44.354
Yeah.

02:44.796 --> 02:45.785
Be right back.

02:45.864 --> 02:48.025
Nice to meet you,
Barbara. Heard a lot about you.

02:48.100 --> 02:49.294
It's nice to meet you.

02:49.368 --> 02:52.098
She's great-looking. What you
talking about? She's terrific.

02:52.171 --> 02:54.105
You're getting married?

02:54.239 --> 02:56.730
Look, Phil, I'm
lonely. I'm a man.

02:56.808 --> 02:59.333
It hasn't been easy for me
since your mom died.

02:59.411 --> 03:02.471
She didn't die,
she divorced you.

03:03.182 --> 03:06.913
Um, tomatoes, tomatoes.
You know.

03:08.720 --> 03:09.846
Baby.

03:12.457 --> 03:15.221
<i>One year later, on the proudest day</i>
<i>of my life,</i>

03:15.294 --> 03:17.353
<i>he was right there</i>
<i>by my side. </i>

03:17.429 --> 03:19.761
There he is,
your grandson, Sam.

03:19.831 --> 03:21.492
7 pounds, 6 ounces.

03:21.567 --> 03:24.661
<i>Oh, by the way, he had a son</i>
<i>on the same day. </i>

03:24.736 --> 03:27.603
Take a gander
at your brother, Bucky.

03:27.673 --> 03:29.641
7 pounds, 7.

03:30.509 --> 03:31.806
Just a little bit bigger.

03:34.913 --> 03:37.108
<i>Welcome to my life. </i>

04:10.482 --> 04:13.883
Excuse me. Hey, y-you didn't
need to take up two spots.

04:13.952 --> 04:17.079
Actually, I do. Look at the
size of this bad boy, huh?

04:17.154 --> 04:20.317
This is cute though, huh? You're
saving the environment for all of us.

04:20.392 --> 04:21.654
Go hemp!

04:25.197 --> 04:26.459
Unbelievable.

04:30.202 --> 04:33.694
Okay, boys. Okay.
Keep it down. Keep it simple.

04:33.772 --> 04:35.069
Hey, honey.

04:35.140 --> 04:37.631
Where've you been? It's
a tie game, it's almost over.

04:37.709 --> 04:39.142
Oh, I-I-I'm sorry.

04:39.211 --> 04:40.542
I... I just...
I got caught at work

04:40.612 --> 04:43.672
and then I had to park
in the far parking lot.

04:44.449 --> 04:45.814
Let's go, Gladiators!

04:45.951 --> 04:47.077
Go, Bucky!

04:48.487 --> 04:49.511
Hey, where's Sam?

04:49.588 --> 04:50.577
He's on the bench.

04:50.656 --> 04:51.987
Okay, Bucky, let's go!

04:52.057 --> 04:53.615
You're kidding me.
No.

04:53.692 --> 04:57.219
Go Bucky! Finish it off!
Finish it off!

04:57.296 --> 04:58.763
Come on, Bucky!

05:00.465 --> 05:02.092
Yay, Bucky! Bucky!

05:03.235 --> 05:05.135
Bucky!
Okay, Bucky.

05:05.203 --> 05:07.228
Yes! Yes! Yes!

05:07.306 --> 05:11.299
That's my boy, Bucky!
Attaboy, Bucky!

05:11.576 --> 05:13.339
Hey, big guy, how'd it go?

05:13.412 --> 05:15.642
It went great.
Bench is nice and warm.

05:15.714 --> 05:18.274
I'm gonna see what I can do
about that, okay?

05:19.284 --> 05:20.774
We'll see you
back at the house, Dad.

05:20.852 --> 05:22.877
You played great,
Son. You played great.

05:22.954 --> 05:24.444
I'm proud of you.

05:24.523 --> 05:25.820
Come on, buddy.

05:27.726 --> 05:29.353
Hi, you guys.

05:29.428 --> 05:30.861
Oh, Barb.
Hi.

05:30.929 --> 05:34.797
Hey, look who's here. Two
of my favorite people, and Phil.

05:34.866 --> 05:37.061
Very funny, Dad. Haven't
heard that one before.

05:37.135 --> 05:38.397
Hey, Buck.

05:39.471 --> 05:41.496
I see you got a new case
for the PelÃ© ball.

05:41.573 --> 05:43.040
That's my ball.

05:43.108 --> 05:46.100
Get away from that. Don't... Don't
get any ideas. Don't even touch it.

05:46.178 --> 05:47.805
<i>And now... </i> Watch this.

05:47.879 --> 05:49.870
<i>An important message</i>
<i>from the King. </i>

05:49.948 --> 05:52.678
<i>Hi, I'm Buck Weston,</i>
<i>King of Sporting Goods. </i>

05:52.751 --> 05:53.809
<i>You can save... </i>
Me.

05:53.885 --> 05:56.376
<i>Big on all kinds of balls. </i>

05:56.455 --> 05:59.481
<i>Basketballs, footballs,</i>

05:59.558 --> 06:02.686
<i>hockey pucks, baseballs... </i>

06:02.761 --> 06:04.422
Those acting lessons
really paid off.

06:04.496 --> 06:07.693
Yeah, I got four stores now, and
I'm opening a fifth next month

06:07.766 --> 06:08.824
in your neck of the woods.

06:08.900 --> 06:10.265
You sure you
don't want a job?

06:10.335 --> 06:11.393
I got a job, Dad.

06:11.470 --> 06:13.267
Oh, yeah, what?
Selling... Selling vitamins?

06:13.338 --> 06:15.067
In fact, you need to take
more vitamins.

06:15.140 --> 06:17.608
I take a vitamin every day,
it's called a steak.

06:18.076 --> 06:20.306
Now look, I came up with
this myself, look at this.

06:20.379 --> 06:21.937
<i>I'm Buck Weston. </i>

06:22.013 --> 06:24.208
<i>And he's got balls!</i>

06:25.417 --> 06:27.214
Pretty good, huh?
What do you think?

06:27.285 --> 06:29.719
I think this is
your best commercial yet.

06:29.788 --> 06:31.153
It was pretty good.

06:31.223 --> 06:33.157
Gripping. Gripping.

06:33.225 --> 06:34.317
Ditka.

06:34.393 --> 06:35.860
Stay away from that, okay?

06:35.927 --> 06:37.554
Here we go again.

06:38.663 --> 06:40.130
Hey, Ditka!
Will you knock it off?

06:40.198 --> 06:41.665
Hey, knock it off,
would you?

06:43.001 --> 06:45.128
Hey, do that later,
would you, please?

06:45.203 --> 06:46.602
I got company!

06:48.106 --> 06:49.130
Doing my lawn.

06:49.207 --> 06:51.675
Look, we're trying to have
a nice family gathering, all right?

06:51.743 --> 06:53.142
I'm trying to get
my yard cleaned.

06:53.211 --> 06:55.236
You're messing up my yard.
Let me... Let me ask you.

06:55.313 --> 06:57.474
The world's gotta stop
'cause you got a family gathering?

06:57.549 --> 06:59.608
I'm trying to do my lawn!
Yeah, but you put all your...

06:59.684 --> 07:00.616
Guys...

07:00.685 --> 07:02.653
Hey, stay out of this.
It's between us, okay?

07:02.721 --> 07:05.451
Here, take some of this back,
'cause I don't want it.

07:05.524 --> 07:07.219
Hey! Knock it off!
It's all for you!

07:07.292 --> 07:08.725
You're nuts!
Guys, guys!

07:08.794 --> 07:09.954
How do you like that, Ditka?

07:10.028 --> 07:10.995
Take it back.

07:11.062 --> 07:12.495
Here, you get
the whole thing!

07:14.232 --> 07:15.460
We'll settle this later,
okay?

07:15.534 --> 07:16.831
Yeah, you know
where to find me!

07:16.902 --> 07:17.891
Yeah, exactly.

07:17.969 --> 07:19.903
I got this for you, too!
Get out of here!

07:19.971 --> 07:21.461
Phil, come on.

07:21.540 --> 07:22.632
What are you lookin' at?

07:22.707 --> 07:24.732
Dad, he hit me.
He hit me with the ball.

07:25.977 --> 07:28.844
Hey, Dad, what happened
to all your fish?

07:28.914 --> 07:32.441
That one ate the others.
I call him "Killer. "

07:32.984 --> 07:33.882
Killer?

07:33.952 --> 07:34.884
Yeah.

07:34.953 --> 07:35.851
I like it.

07:35.921 --> 07:36.853
Yeah.

07:36.922 --> 07:39.049
You might wanna clean the
water every now and then.

07:39.124 --> 07:40.853
Let's see what you can do.

07:40.959 --> 07:42.290
Hey, Dad,
I didn't know if...

07:42.360 --> 07:43.987
I wanted to
talk to you about Sam.

07:44.062 --> 07:45.290
Sammy's a good boy.

07:45.363 --> 07:46.352
Yeah. Yeah.

07:46.431 --> 07:47.398
Yeah.

07:47.466 --> 07:50.264
He hasn't been playing much
lately and, I didn't know if...

07:50.335 --> 07:52.326
Stop right there.
I agree with you.

07:52.404 --> 07:53.871
And I got some
great news.

07:53.939 --> 07:55.998
He's gonna get a
lot more playing time now.

07:56.074 --> 07:58.372
Dad, thanks, that's...
that's exactly what I wanted to hear.

07:58.443 --> 07:59.933
I traded him
to the Tigers.

08:01.112 --> 08:02.101
Ooh, hey!

08:03.715 --> 08:05.182
You traded
your own grandson?

08:05.250 --> 08:07.343
Well, I didn't actually
get anything for him.

08:07.419 --> 08:09.148
You know that cost $400?

08:09.221 --> 08:10.381
I can't believe it.

08:10.455 --> 08:12.980
W
- What, you calling me a liar? I'll show you the receipt.

08:13.058 --> 08:14.821
No, I-I'm talking
about Sam!

08:14.893 --> 08:16.485
W- Why didn't you
just play him more?

08:16.561 --> 08:17.960
He is going to
play more, Philly...

08:18.029 --> 08:19.496
Yeah, for another team!

08:19.564 --> 08:22.260
You... You... You care
about winning that much?

08:22.334 --> 08:25.326
Look, Phil, I'm
not just coaching soccer.

08:25.403 --> 08:26.700
I'm building men.

08:26.771 --> 08:27.829
Okay, yeah.

08:27.906 --> 08:28.838
Hey, hey, hey.

08:28.907 --> 08:30.898
It's an impressive shot.
Sure.

08:30.976 --> 08:32.636
But, you know,
I want Sam to have fun.

08:32.711 --> 08:33.972
This isn't the big leagues.

08:34.044 --> 08:36.275
For those who live between
Broadway and Grandville,

08:36.347 --> 08:37.780
between the ages
of 10 and 12,

08:37.849 --> 08:40.510
who are free
on Sundays and Tuesdays,

08:40.818 --> 08:42.446
this is the big leagues.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.284
But what about Sam?

08:44.556 --> 08:47.252
Sam, you saw him out there
today. It breaks my heart.

08:47.325 --> 08:49.589
At best,
he's a benchwarmer.

08:51.062 --> 08:52.586
Wow! Oh!

08:53.398 --> 08:55.662
Oh, Killer! Killer!

08:55.734 --> 08:57.065
How did that happen?

09:12.150 --> 09:13.777
Hey, Sam,
you wanna give us a minute?

09:13.852 --> 09:15.080
Need a little adult time.

09:15.153 --> 09:16.381
Uh-huh.

09:20.225 --> 09:22.022
Of all the asinine things
my dad has done,

09:22.093 --> 09:24.357
this is by far
the most asinine.

09:24.429 --> 09:27.762
I mean, I know he's the
most competitive man in the world.

09:27.832 --> 09:30.801
But this beats them all.
I'm angry.

09:31.603 --> 09:33.571
I'm... I'm spitting angry!

09:34.873 --> 09:38.104
I'm like a tornado of anger,
swirling about!

09:38.476 --> 09:41.411
My heart rate is
dangerously high right now.

09:42.013 --> 09:43.173
I'm glad it happened,
I...

09:43.248 --> 09:45.113
What?
Yeah.

09:45.183 --> 09:46.445
What do you mean?

09:46.518 --> 09:49.248
Where did my wife go?
Are you a robot?

09:49.421 --> 09:50.649
Are you a robot-woman?

09:50.722 --> 09:52.690
I... I am not a robot.

09:53.224 --> 09:55.089
Phil, honey, I know
this is upsetting, okay,

09:55.160 --> 09:57.890
but you have to try to
find the positive in this.

09:57.963 --> 10:01.023
It was unhealthy for Sam to
play on your dad's team.

10:01.099 --> 10:03.033
Now he'll play
for the Tigers

10:03.101 --> 10:05.092
And have some fun.

10:05.303 --> 10:07.066
Okay, look,
you're too upset about this.

10:07.138 --> 10:09.231
So, I'll tell him, okay?

10:09.307 --> 10:11.400
No, no, no,
no, no, no, I...

10:12.243 --> 10:14.006
I need to tell him.

10:17.015 --> 10:18.380
Benchwarmer?

10:22.320 --> 10:23.787
Boy, did that hurt my face.

10:26.124 --> 10:27.318
Sammy?
Yeah?

10:27.525 --> 10:28.583
Hey.
Hey.

10:28.660 --> 10:30.389
What are you doing?
Nothing.

10:30.462 --> 10:32.157
Internet dating?
No.

10:32.230 --> 10:33.788
Mail-order bride?
No.

10:33.865 --> 10:35.332
Just kidding.

10:35.400 --> 10:37.834
Look, uh, I got some good news.

10:39.437 --> 10:41.234
I got you put on a new team.

10:41.773 --> 10:43.673
I'm not on the Gladiators
anymore?

10:43.742 --> 10:44.868
No.

10:44.943 --> 10:46.137
You're on the Tigers.

10:47.379 --> 10:49.108
The Tigers?
Yeah.

10:49.180 --> 10:51.080
They're in last place.

10:51.316 --> 10:54.285
Yeah, but you're gonna get
more playing time.

10:54.519 --> 10:56.282
Did Grandpa trade me?

10:57.122 --> 10:58.180
No.

11:00.592 --> 11:03.390
Yes, wait.
I'm happy this is happening.

11:03.461 --> 11:04.519
This is a good thing.

11:04.596 --> 11:06.496
You know, it doesn't seem
like a good thing,

11:06.564 --> 11:08.088
but it's a good thing.
Trust me.

11:08.166 --> 11:10.430
You do not wanna be
the kid

11:10.502 --> 11:12.993
that's on the other end
of the bench.

11:13.071 --> 11:14.936
You do not
want to be that kid.

11:15.006 --> 11:16.530
'Cause I know that kid.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.233
You don't wanna be him.

11:18.309 --> 11:19.435
Okay.

11:19.511 --> 11:23.709
You don't wanna be the kid
who has such suppressed rage

11:24.315 --> 11:27.216
that his heart's about
to burst through his chest.

11:28.720 --> 11:31.280
You don't wanna be the
kid that when he thinks about

11:31.356 --> 11:32.721
what his dad did to him...

11:33.892 --> 11:35.860
I know that kid. I know.

11:35.927 --> 11:37.724
That kid lives right here
in this house!

11:37.796 --> 11:38.820
Mom!

11:40.799 --> 11:42.198
Oh.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.432
Mom!

11:43.501 --> 11:45.594
He doesn't know what to do.
He doesn't...

11:45.670 --> 11:46.659
Ouch!

11:47.105 --> 11:48.129
Phew.

11:48.206 --> 11:49.969
Okay?
Yes. Good.

11:51.209 --> 11:53.268
Coach Benson will be good
for you. He knows his stuff.

11:53.344 --> 11:55.369
I bet you this whole thing
is gonna turn out to be

11:55.447 --> 11:57.438
a blessing in disguise.

11:58.083 --> 11:59.778
Hey, the Tigers
may be in last place,

11:59.851 --> 12:02.012
but those guys
look pretty good.

12:02.087 --> 12:03.987
Dad, those
aren't the Tigers.

12:04.055 --> 12:05.454
They're not even
wearing blue.

12:05.523 --> 12:06.888
The Tigers are
over there.

12:06.958 --> 12:10.291
I'm having a baby.
Oh, I'm having a baby.

12:10.962 --> 12:12.589
No hitting the baby.

12:12.664 --> 12:14.097
No, no, don't hit
my precious baby.

12:15.166 --> 12:17.726
Oh, look, it's gonna come
out! It's gonna come out! Oh!

12:17.802 --> 12:18.769
Cut it out!

12:18.837 --> 12:19.895
Oh, it's gonna come out!

12:19.971 --> 12:20.960
Oh.

12:22.540 --> 12:25.532
Hi, excuse me. Uh,
Coach Benson around?

12:25.610 --> 12:27.168
Yeah, you all know
Phil Weston?

12:27.245 --> 12:28.371
Oh, yeah.

12:28.446 --> 12:30.243
Hey, welcome to the team,
little fellow.

12:30.315 --> 12:32.545
Why don't you go join
those other kids over there?

12:32.617 --> 12:34.141
Yeah, go ahead.

12:35.286 --> 12:37.618
There's a moving truck
in front of Benson's house.

12:37.689 --> 12:39.987
Did you hear? The pressure
of coaching got to him.

12:40.058 --> 12:41.047
He cracked.

12:41.126 --> 12:44.618
How could he crack? We're
only one game into the season.

12:44.696 --> 12:46.459
All right,
Tigers, it's game time.

12:46.531 --> 12:48.226
Oh, but we're waiting
for our coach.

12:48.299 --> 12:49.926
Well, then one of you
will have to coach.

12:50.001 --> 12:52.196
Yeah, but I had talked to Coach
Benson, we're brand new...

12:52.270 --> 12:53.464
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
All right.

12:53.538 --> 12:55.802
Find yourself a coach,
or the Tigers forfeit.

12:56.775 --> 12:57.799
Yes?

12:57.876 --> 12:59.173
Where do I know you from?

12:59.244 --> 13:01.007
I've been your neighbor
for seven years.

13:01.079 --> 13:02.171
No, that ain't it.

13:02.247 --> 13:03.976
No, that's definitely it.

13:04.048 --> 13:05.811
I'll figure it out.

13:06.785 --> 13:07.774
So, who's gonna coach?

13:07.852 --> 13:10.980
We got Mark into soccer, 'cause
we wanted to take a break.

13:11.055 --> 13:12.989
I didn't think I'd be
coaching the little bugger.

13:13.057 --> 13:15.491
I just got laid off.
I'm looking for a job

13:15.593 --> 13:18.585
so it's hard enough
to drag myself out of bed.

13:20.632 --> 13:22.259
So, uh, we forfeit.

13:23.835 --> 13:25.325
So, we're forfeiting?

13:26.037 --> 13:27.800
No, no, no, no. Uh,

13:28.473 --> 13:29.940
you know what,
I... I can coach.

13:30.008 --> 13:31.373
Well, that's swell!
Great!

13:31.442 --> 13:32.739
Just for one game.

13:32.811 --> 13:35.041
Right. It's game time.
Get your team on the field.

13:35.113 --> 13:36.375
Who are we playing?

13:36.514 --> 13:37.811
How about
you use your eyes?

13:39.117 --> 13:40.641
Oh, great.

13:40.718 --> 13:42.913
All right, guys. Everybody
up. Let's go, come on.

13:42.987 --> 13:45.649
Let's go, come on. Lift them.
Lift them. Hey, hey, hey.

13:48.693 --> 13:50.456
What are you doing here?
Where's Benson?

13:50.528 --> 13:52.928
Oh, Benson's a no-show.
I'm gonna coach the Tigers today.

13:52.997 --> 13:55.158
Ooh. You sure
you wanna do that?

13:55.233 --> 13:56.495
How you doing, Buck?

13:56.568 --> 13:58.331
Players take the field.
Good luck, Buck.

13:58.403 --> 13:59.870
Yeah. All right.
Yeah, good luck.

13:59.938 --> 14:01.872
Yeah, you too.
May the best man win?

14:01.940 --> 14:03.407
Oh, he will.
Yeah.

14:04.509 --> 14:07.910
J.T., let's go. Hey,
let's go, everybody. Hey, hey!

14:09.347 --> 14:11.178
Okay. Let's go, guys.

14:12.817 --> 14:16.583
Okay, Tigers, uh, why don't
we have starters take the field?

14:19.591 --> 14:21.616
We don't have starters,
we never got that far.

14:21.693 --> 14:24.753
All right. Well, then, how
about, uh you, you, you?

14:24.863 --> 14:25.852
Yes.

14:26.064 --> 14:26.996
You.

14:27.065 --> 14:27.963
Me?

14:28.032 --> 14:28.964
No, not you.

14:29.033 --> 14:32.628
You, Sam, you, you, you,
and you.

14:32.770 --> 14:34.135
You guys, hit the field.

14:35.006 --> 14:36.064
All right!

14:36.140 --> 14:37.630
Go get them. Huh?

14:38.109 --> 14:39.076
Go get them.

14:39.143 --> 14:40.735
They're
gonna kill us, you know.

14:40.812 --> 14:42.211
I'm sorry,
did you say something?

14:42.280 --> 14:43.474
We're gonna get killed.

14:43.548 --> 14:44.845
Oh, you don't know that
for sure.

14:44.916 --> 14:47.441
Yeah, I do.
And it's gonna be awful.

14:48.686 --> 14:50.415
Charge!

14:52.223 --> 14:53.315
Defense!

14:54.759 --> 14:56.021
Get the ball!

15:01.666 --> 15:02.690
Yeah!

15:02.800 --> 15:03.858
That was fast.

15:07.939 --> 15:09.304
Sorry about the fall, Sam.

15:09.440 --> 15:10.839
See you at the barbecue.

15:10.909 --> 15:11.898
Come on!

15:21.853 --> 15:23.684
Great, great, great.

15:23.755 --> 15:24.744
You wanna go in?

15:24.822 --> 15:26.346
No. I'm fine.

15:27.091 --> 15:28.319
You guys?
No, I'm cool.

15:28.393 --> 15:29.417
I'm staying.

15:47.946 --> 15:49.345
That's the game!

15:50.682 --> 15:53.583
Poetry in motion, Philly!

15:56.387 --> 15:58.184
Bring it on in.

15:58.923 --> 16:02.757
Gather around.
Come on in. Good job.

16:07.031 --> 16:09.727
Powerful kicking.
Powerful kicking.

16:12.270 --> 16:15.262
Uh, excuse me. Just don't
do that with the cup.

16:16.040 --> 16:18.702
All in all, just,
yeah, good.

16:19.477 --> 16:20.808
Good... Good group effort.

16:20.878 --> 16:22.505
Were you watching
the same game?

16:22.580 --> 16:23.911
Yeah.

16:24.415 --> 16:26.508
Really, give yourselves
a pat on the back.

16:26.584 --> 16:28.415
Inspiring speech, Phil.

16:32.457 --> 16:33.481
Hey, Patty.

16:33.558 --> 16:36.026
Hey, darling. How you doing?
Looking great out there.

16:36.094 --> 16:37.789
Yeah, you said it. Yeah.

16:38.329 --> 16:39.523
Tough game today, eh?

16:39.597 --> 16:41.189
We did okay.
Yeah.

16:41.733 --> 16:44.964
All right, look. Now what
do you say I take Sam back,

16:45.036 --> 16:47.061
be on a winning team,
he'll get a trophy,

16:47.138 --> 16:48.867
and who cares
if he's a benchwarmer?

16:48.940 --> 16:50.271
No.
No?

16:50.341 --> 16:52.366
No. No, he's not
going to be a benchwarmer.

16:52.443 --> 16:55.571
Not my son.
Not on your team.

16:57.015 --> 16:59.176
'Cause I'm, uh,
I'm gonna coach the Tigers.

16:59.384 --> 17:00.783
Ooh, ouch.

17:00.852 --> 17:02.080
"Ouch. " Why "ouch"?

17:02.153 --> 17:03.916
Nothing. Nothing.

17:06.723 --> 17:08.782
You really think you
can coach in my league?

17:08.859 --> 17:09.952
Yeah.

17:10.028 --> 17:11.154
Okay.

17:13.297 --> 17:15.026
I'll see you on the field.

17:15.233 --> 17:18.134
Okay. Be forewarned, <i>muchacho. </i>

17:18.202 --> 17:20.136
You're in the show now.

17:20.204 --> 17:21.432
What was that all about?

17:21.506 --> 17:23.770
I'm gonna be the new
permanent coach of the Tigers.

17:23.840 --> 17:24.967
Really?
Yep.

17:25.042 --> 17:26.101
Cool!

17:26.176 --> 17:27.576
Honey, that's great.
Yeah.

17:27.645 --> 17:28.703
Why are you so angry?

17:28.780 --> 17:30.645
No, this... this isn't angry.
This is happy.

17:31.149 --> 17:33.674
Yay. This could be fun.
Yep.

17:33.918 --> 17:34.907
Okay.
Okay,

17:34.986 --> 17:36.613
I got a lot of work to do.

17:37.655 --> 17:38.917
Come on.

17:44.395 --> 17:46.090
Take that for me, buddy.

17:46.497 --> 17:47.987
Hi. Oh, hello.

17:48.066 --> 17:50.796
We didn't get to introduce
ourselves last time. I'm Ann Hogan.

17:50.868 --> 17:51.835
Hi.

17:51.903 --> 17:53.029
Donna Jones.

17:53.104 --> 17:54.969
Hi.
You can call me "Chief. "

17:55.106 --> 17:56.971
Okay. This is my son, Sam.

17:57.041 --> 17:58.133
Hi.
Hey, Sam.

17:58.209 --> 17:59.506
Hi, this is Byong Sun.

17:59.577 --> 18:01.135
Hi, Byong Sun.
Hi, Byong Sun.

18:01.212 --> 18:03.976
Byong Sun and Sam, why don't
you guys go on ahead, okay?

18:04.048 --> 18:05.140
Okay.

18:05.216 --> 18:06.581
All right. Okay, good.

18:06.651 --> 18:07.982
Yeah, Byong Sun's real shy.

18:08.052 --> 18:09.713
This book really helped us deal with it.

18:09.787 --> 18:11.687
Okay. You'll probably
wanna give it a glance.

18:11.756 --> 18:13.485
<i>"My Child is Shy. "</i>
Yeah.

18:13.658 --> 18:14.625
Thank you.

18:14.692 --> 18:15.784
Good.
Thank you.

18:15.860 --> 18:17.452
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
who's your son?

18:17.528 --> 18:19.086
Byong Sun.
Oh, I see.

18:20.665 --> 18:22.496
Actually, I...
You know what, I don't see.

18:22.567 --> 18:23.795
I'm sorry, I...

18:23.868 --> 18:26.302
Oh, wait, now I see. Wow!

18:27.839 --> 18:28.828
Okay.

18:28.906 --> 18:30.032
We're at every game.

18:30.108 --> 18:31.666
Not like a lot
of the other parents.

18:31.742 --> 18:34.040
No, no, no, not like
the other parents at all.

18:35.446 --> 18:38.142
Better! You're better
than the other parents.

18:39.417 --> 18:41.214
Oh, so they're better?

18:41.285 --> 18:43.651
No, no, I mean... I mean, they're...
Well, they're different.

18:43.721 --> 18:45.382
What do you mean
"different"?

18:45.456 --> 18:47.686
No, I... You're different
because you're better.

18:47.758 --> 18:48.747
How are they better?

18:48.826 --> 18:49.884
No, look...

18:49.961 --> 18:52.452
You're both better different

18:53.131 --> 18:55.599
in a different
but better way.

18:55.666 --> 18:57.691
Okay. You know what,
let's get the rest.

18:57.768 --> 19:00.236
A little early to start
playing favorites, Phil.

19:02.006 --> 19:03.997
Okay, guys,
let's take the field.

19:05.076 --> 19:06.065
Get up, Dad.

19:06.144 --> 19:07.338
Nice fall.

19:10.314 --> 19:11.338
Hold up!

19:11.415 --> 19:12.439
Love it, yeah!

19:12.517 --> 19:13.643
Grab a ball!

19:14.185 --> 19:18.144
Here we go. Fan out.
Form a circle here.

19:18.422 --> 19:21.414
Great. Okay, now,

19:21.492 --> 19:22.959
I don't know,
it may just be me,

19:23.027 --> 19:26.190
but, uh, I really got a
feeling like we could catch fire

19:26.264 --> 19:28.164
and have a great season. Huh?

19:28.232 --> 19:29.631
Now, who's with me?

19:30.801 --> 19:34.032
It's electric in the air!
Yeah!

19:36.908 --> 19:39.502
Thank you for that show
of enthusiasm.

19:39.911 --> 19:43.938
Uh, well, I... I thought we would
just start, uh, today by going around,

19:44.415 --> 19:46.315
introducing yourselves,
and telling me

19:46.384 --> 19:48.352
your... your strengths
on the soccer field.

19:49.420 --> 19:50.409
All right.

19:51.222 --> 19:52.382
Start with you.

19:52.456 --> 19:53.582
Hey, I'm Hunter.

19:53.658 --> 19:55.626
Hey, Hunter. I'm Phil.

19:55.893 --> 19:59.351
Hi, Phil. Uh, I-I'll
eat this worm for $5.

20:01.032 --> 20:02.329
How would that help us?

20:03.134 --> 20:04.726
I'd have an extra $5?

20:08.739 --> 20:10.934
No, you're not going to
eat that, are you?

20:12.810 --> 20:13.799
Ugh!

20:15.446 --> 20:16.913
Did you just eat that?

20:17.315 --> 20:19.044
Yeah, I ate it.

20:19.817 --> 20:21.409
Now you owe me $5.

20:21.485 --> 20:23.612
I didn't agree to pay you $5.

20:23.754 --> 20:25.881
Forget it.
Pass it to someone else.

20:31.028 --> 20:32.290
I'm Byong Sun.

20:32.363 --> 20:34.126
Hi, Byong Sun.

20:34.365 --> 20:36.458
I am a very kind person.

20:37.068 --> 20:39.400
Oh, that's sweet.
That's very sweet.

20:40.004 --> 20:41.528
Anything that relates
to soccer?

20:41.606 --> 20:43.096
No, sir.

20:43.207 --> 20:45.232
You know, maybe you and
Ambrose could... could team up.

20:45.309 --> 20:48.642
He's big. You... You might
form one mega-person.

20:53.751 --> 20:55.150
Okay, forget that
I just said that.

20:55.219 --> 20:57.551
Uh, pass it
to... to someone else.

20:59.023 --> 21:00.047
I'm Mark Avery.

21:00.124 --> 21:02.319
You know, I like to keep
my pimp hands strong.

21:02.393 --> 21:04.020
You dig, cracker?
You feel me?

21:04.095 --> 21:05.926
W- What does that mean?

21:05.997 --> 21:07.157
I really don't know.

21:07.231 --> 21:09.495
I heard it
on a rap video once.

21:09.634 --> 21:10.623
Oh.

21:10.701 --> 21:12.965
But, I'm, like, really funny.
I got like a million jokes.

21:13.037 --> 21:15.403
Great. Okay, yeah.
I'd love to hear one. Shoot.

21:15.473 --> 21:16.770
Remember when
you called us out

21:16.841 --> 21:18.399
onto the field
and you fell over?

21:18.476 --> 21:19.943
Right. Yeah?

21:21.846 --> 21:24.110
Man! I got you good!

21:28.386 --> 21:31.082
Somebody call the burn unit.
I got you bad!

21:31.389 --> 21:32.720
How did I get burned?

21:33.824 --> 21:34.916
Apparently,
I don't get it, okay.

21:34.992 --> 21:35.981
Doesn't matter.

21:36.060 --> 21:37.994
Uh, you know what?
Let's just do some drills.

21:38.062 --> 21:39.188
Now, this one,

21:39.263 --> 21:41.527
all the great players have
done at one time or another.

21:41.599 --> 21:42.759
It's called "the snake. "

21:42.833 --> 21:45.199
Player in the back
dribbles the ball

21:45.269 --> 21:47.100
in a weaving fashion
around the player

21:47.171 --> 21:49.731
and stops 3 feet
from the first player.

21:51.475 --> 21:52.407
Hey!

21:54.278 --> 21:57.008
Okay, that's not the snake.

21:58.783 --> 21:59.909
Uh...

22:02.386 --> 22:03.876
Honey,
it was your first practice.

22:03.954 --> 22:05.216
It'll get better.

22:05.289 --> 22:06.756
No, it's gonna get worse.

22:06.891 --> 22:08.358
You need to give it
some time, Phil.

22:08.426 --> 22:10.087
No. I already know.
It was awful.

22:10.161 --> 22:11.492
The kids were
just running around.

22:11.562 --> 22:12.859
They weren't
listening to me.

22:12.930 --> 22:15.057
They were like
4- foot whirling dervishes.

22:15.132 --> 22:17.293
And I don't even know
what a whirling dervish is,

22:17.368 --> 22:19.893
but that's... that's what
they were like.

22:19.970 --> 22:22.598
You know why?
'Cause I'm not a coach.

22:22.673 --> 22:24.971
Okay? I don't know
what I'm doing.

22:25.042 --> 22:28.136
My dad. He's a coach.
He knows the game.

22:28.212 --> 22:30.703
He's confident, he's smart,

22:30.781 --> 22:34.911
witty, dynamic,
vicious, brutal, vindictive.

22:34.985 --> 22:36.316
A monster.

22:36.387 --> 22:37.945
And he will win
through intimidation

22:38.022 --> 22:40.456
and forceful tactics
if need be.

22:40.524 --> 22:42.219
I'm not like that.

22:43.227 --> 22:45.889
In fact, I don't know
anyone like that.

22:46.530 --> 22:47.656
Do you?

22:51.369 --> 22:53.132
So, Paul,
what's on your mind?

22:53.270 --> 22:55.261
Uh, actually, it's Phil.

22:55.473 --> 22:56.462
You mean, it's not Paul?

22:56.540 --> 22:57.598
No, it's Phil.

22:57.675 --> 22:59.609
What's the difference?
Come on. Spit it out.

22:59.677 --> 23:00.666
Uh, here it is.

23:00.745 --> 23:01.643
Mike!

23:01.712 --> 23:02.644
Hold this.

23:03.814 --> 23:08.217
Oh, no. No, no, we do not
allow smoking in the house.

23:08.786 --> 23:10.754
I- I'm sorry, Mrs. Ditka.

23:11.088 --> 23:13.420
Here, I'll
get rid of it, honey.

23:15.159 --> 23:17.923
Anyway, uh, I-I'm coaching
my son's soccer team.

23:18.229 --> 23:20.925
And... And I... I didn't
know if you might be willing to help.

23:20.998 --> 23:21.965
Soccer?

23:22.032 --> 23:25.092
Actually, uh, I... I want you
to assistant coach.

23:26.137 --> 23:27.934
Your assistant coach?

23:28.439 --> 23:30.100
You really don't know
who I am, do you?

23:30.174 --> 23:31.801
You're right. Silly idea.

23:31.876 --> 23:33.207
I just... I just
need some help

23:33.277 --> 23:34.505
and you're such
a great coach.

23:34.578 --> 23:36.637
My dad's gonna be riding
me all season, so I just...

23:36.714 --> 23:39.080
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho,
your dad?

23:39.150 --> 23:41.516
You mean I get to coach
against your dad?

23:41.585 --> 23:42.552
Well, yeah.

23:42.620 --> 23:44.144
Mike, I smell smoke!

23:44.221 --> 23:45.745
Nobody's smokin'!

23:45.823 --> 23:47.154
Mike!
For Pete's sake!

23:47.224 --> 23:49.249
So, like, it's me and you
against your old man?

23:49.326 --> 23:50.588
I mean,
there are other teams.

23:50.661 --> 23:51.559
Gotcha!

23:51.629 --> 23:53.688
No smoking means
no smokin'!

23:53.764 --> 23:55.026
Okay, come on, Phil.

23:55.099 --> 23:56.896
I'll throw this out
the window, honey.

23:56.967 --> 23:58.901
Uh, I-I'm sorry, Mrs. D...
I'm sorry.

23:58.969 --> 24:00.493
You should be.

24:01.705 --> 24:03.195
It's a nasty, filthy habit.

24:03.274 --> 24:04.263
Hey.

24:04.809 --> 24:05.901
You can count me in.

24:05.976 --> 24:06.874
Really?

24:06.944 --> 24:08.707
Let's bring your
old man down. Oh, great.

24:10.381 --> 24:11.575
Give me a drink.

24:11.649 --> 24:14.311
It's just a great group.
Okay, uh, Tigers.

24:16.520 --> 24:18.147
Look who's here.

24:19.490 --> 24:21.014
I'll give you a hint.

24:21.459 --> 24:22.687
Hall of Fame?

24:23.160 --> 24:24.491
Chicago Bears?

24:25.496 --> 24:26.428
Sammy Sosa?

24:26.497 --> 24:27.521
No, no, no.
Come on.

24:27.598 --> 24:28.895
No, football.

24:28.966 --> 24:30.524
Coached the 1986...

24:30.601 --> 24:31.533
'85.

24:31.602 --> 24:34.571
Uh, '85 Bears
to a Super Bowl victory?

24:34.638 --> 24:35.798
It's Mike Ditka.

24:35.873 --> 24:37.101
Yeah.

24:37.308 --> 24:38.605
Do you know Sammy Sosa?

24:38.676 --> 24:40.200
Hey, zip it, kid!

24:40.277 --> 24:42.040
I'm a coach that knows
about winning.

24:42.112 --> 24:46.139
I'm gonna push you guys like
you've never been pushed before.

24:46.217 --> 24:47.809
Some of you are
gonna wish I was dead.

24:47.885 --> 24:48.909
It's true.

24:48.986 --> 24:50.920
I know it's a weird thought,
but it's true.

24:50.988 --> 24:53.650
I eat quitters for breakfast
and I spit out their bones.

24:53.724 --> 24:54.713
Delicious.

24:54.792 --> 24:56.919
Now this is gonna be the
hardest most difficult thing

24:56.994 --> 24:58.894
you ever attempted
in your entire life.

24:58.963 --> 25:01.158
You know what when it's
over... It will get emotional.

25:01.232 --> 25:02.790
When it's over...
When it's over...

25:02.867 --> 25:04.858
...you guys are gonna
be champions. Champions.

25:04.935 --> 25:06.732
By God, you're
gonna be champions.

25:06.804 --> 25:08.169
All right, everybody up.
Come on.

25:08.239 --> 25:09.331
Come on, hands in.

25:09.406 --> 25:11.465
Come on, everybody. Let's
go out and kick some butt.

25:11.542 --> 25:14.409
Here we go. On three.
Let's have fun.

25:14.478 --> 25:17.914
One, two, three.
Let's have fun.

25:18.516 --> 25:19.881
"Let's have fun?"
What's that?

25:19.950 --> 25:21.042
I just made it up.

25:22.319 --> 25:24.287
On the ground, give me
the pushups, come on.

25:24.355 --> 25:25.982
If you guys
were with the Bears,

25:26.056 --> 25:28.024
I'd fine you each
$10,000 apiece.

25:28.092 --> 25:29.855
This calls for some
drastic measures.

25:29.927 --> 25:32.020
We're gonna make
some changes around here.

25:32.096 --> 25:35.327
Come on, move it.
Move it! Faster! Faster!

25:35.833 --> 25:37.994
Faster. Faster.

25:38.068 --> 25:41.037
Move it! Move it! Put some
pressure on those legs!

25:41.105 --> 25:43.164
Faster. Faster.

25:43.541 --> 25:45.634
No candy! Your mother said you
can't have any candy!

25:45.709 --> 25:46.733
Please. Give me it back.

25:46.810 --> 25:48.869
No candy.
Please. No. Please?

25:51.916 --> 25:54.441
Hey! I got eyes
in the back of my head.

25:54.652 --> 25:56.677
Come on,
girls. You gotta move it.

25:56.754 --> 25:58.813
You gotta move it.
All the way!

25:58.889 --> 26:00.379
Come on, move it. Move it.

26:00.558 --> 26:04.426
But, coach, how is this
gonna help me with soccer?

26:04.828 --> 26:06.523
It's not gonna
help you with soccer,

26:06.597 --> 26:08.895
but I'm gonna get
my trash taken out, okay?

26:09.199 --> 26:11.861
Come on, Beyonce, let's
get that back end done.

26:12.369 --> 26:14.667
Uh, Coach? Shouldn't we
be going to soccer practice?

26:14.738 --> 26:17.468
I'm not going to soccer
practice with a dirty car.

26:18.876 --> 26:21.037
Here we go, gang.
Let's go, Tigers. Come on.

26:21.111 --> 26:22.408
Let's go get them.

26:22.479 --> 26:24.470
Come on, kick butt out there.

26:25.950 --> 26:26.917
You're great.

26:28.152 --> 26:29.210
Hey, Sam.

26:29.286 --> 26:30.412
Yeah?

26:31.855 --> 26:33.652
What is it, Dad?
How you doing?

26:33.724 --> 26:35.248
Good.
Good. Good.

26:35.492 --> 26:36.481
Ow!

26:36.594 --> 26:38.585
What was that for? Jeez!

26:39.496 --> 26:41.555
Did you just
kick your son?

26:42.199 --> 26:43.223
Yeah.

26:46.971 --> 26:48.529
Stop them! Come on.
Stop them!

26:48.606 --> 26:50.403
Stop them! Stop them!

26:50.474 --> 26:51.736
Are you following me?
No.

26:53.477 --> 26:54.466
Oh.

26:57.114 --> 26:58.012
Oh.

26:58.983 --> 26:59.950
Uh.

27:00.017 --> 27:01.075
Oh.

27:01.151 --> 27:04.314
Shake it off, Sam. Get some
circulation back in your skull.

27:05.756 --> 27:07.348
Go, Jack, go.

27:09.593 --> 27:10.719
Yes.

27:10.794 --> 27:12.352
Yeah! Good job, Jack!

27:14.031 --> 27:15.498
That's a legitimate goal,
right?

27:15.566 --> 27:16.658
That's a real goal.

27:16.734 --> 27:17.962
Okay, then,
that's a real goal.

27:18.035 --> 27:19.696
10 more of those
and we're in business.

27:24.942 --> 27:28.139
Look at me, I'm the ref.
I'm the ref. I'm the ref.

27:28.345 --> 27:30.279
All right. Very funny.

27:30.881 --> 27:33.076
You can't catch me if you
want, because I'm the ref.

27:33.150 --> 27:36.085
Okay. Very funny. Very,
very funny. Very funny.

27:36.553 --> 27:39.181
All right. You all had
a laugh? Fine! Play on!

27:39.256 --> 27:40.280
Sorry about that.

27:40.357 --> 27:41.949
How much do you think
those things are?

27:42.026 --> 27:43.015
I have no idea.

27:46.096 --> 27:47.085
Oh.

27:53.203 --> 27:54.227
Man!

27:54.304 --> 27:55.362
2, 4, 6, 8, WHO...

27:55.439 --> 27:56.736
Shut up you little rats!

27:56.807 --> 27:58.604
They're just showing
their appreciation.

27:58.676 --> 27:59.904
Forget the appreciation.

27:59.977 --> 28:02.070
I wanna win a soccer game!

28:03.013 --> 28:03.945
Okay.

28:04.014 --> 28:05.208
Hey, can I have this?

28:05.282 --> 28:06.977
Yeah, go ahead.
All right!

28:07.851 --> 28:10.217
Uh, good game, everyone.

28:10.287 --> 28:11.845
Great effort.
Come on, let's go.

28:11.922 --> 28:14.288
We'll just reconvene
at a later time.

28:22.099 --> 28:23.430
All right, everyone.

28:23.500 --> 28:25.491
Uh, if I could
have your attention.

28:25.569 --> 28:27.469
I got a little something
for the Tigers here

28:27.538 --> 28:29.699
to express my... my gratitude

28:29.773 --> 28:31.434
and, well,
just a big thank you

28:31.508 --> 28:32.702
for all the hard work.

28:32.776 --> 28:33.765
All right!

28:33.844 --> 28:34.833
So, uh...

28:34.912 --> 28:36.846
So what'd you bring, Phil?

28:36.914 --> 28:38.211
Finches.

28:38.282 --> 28:39.510
Fishes?

28:39.583 --> 28:42.279
No! No, no, no. No.
Finches. Birds.

28:42.352 --> 28:43.546
I'm holding them.

28:43.620 --> 28:45.315
They're tiny birds.

28:45.389 --> 28:48.654
Yeah, so everyone, come
up here and grab a finch.

28:49.727 --> 28:52.218
Come on. Come on, guys.

28:52.663 --> 28:55.962
You can watch them grow, right in
front of your, uh, very own eyes.

28:57.601 --> 28:59.000
We have to keep them?

28:59.136 --> 29:00.535
You get to keep them.

29:00.604 --> 29:01.662
Why is this fun?

29:02.740 --> 29:04.605
<i> I want to welcome you all</i>
<i>to tonight's</i>

29:04.675 --> 29:08.008
<i>Highland Heights Soccer Organization</i>
<i>parent's dinner. </i>

29:11.815 --> 29:13.476
<i>Every year, we like to take</i>
<i>a little time</i>

29:13.550 --> 29:15.518
<i>for the coaches</i>
<i>to come up here</i>

29:15.586 --> 29:17.076
<i>to tell us a little</i>
<i>about their team. </i>

29:17.154 --> 29:18.178
All right.

29:18.255 --> 29:20.951
<i>How about I bring up someone who's new</i>
<i>to coaching in this league,</i>

29:21.024 --> 29:22.491
<i>but is close to me?</i>

29:22.559 --> 29:25.119
<i>I love him like a son. </i>
<i>Come on up, Phil. </i>

29:25.195 --> 29:26.526
Come on, Phil.

29:26.597 --> 29:27.894
<i>Come on, Philly. Come on. </i>

29:27.965 --> 29:29.455
Go. Yes.

29:30.701 --> 29:32.362
<i>Good guy. Good guy. </i>

29:34.204 --> 29:35.603
<i>Good to see you. </i>

29:37.975 --> 29:39.135
<i>Thanks, Dad. </i>

29:39.443 --> 29:41.775
<i>Uh, thanks, Janice. </i>

29:44.148 --> 29:45.376
<i>Hello, uh,</i>

29:45.849 --> 29:47.612
<i>I'm, uh, I'm Phil Weston. </i>

29:47.684 --> 29:49.151
And you got balls!

29:50.954 --> 29:52.546
He's got vitamins.

29:55.526 --> 29:57.653
<i>That's very funny, Dad. </i>
<i>Hilarious. </i>

29:58.262 --> 29:59.991
<i>So when I took over</i>
<i>for Coach Benson... </i>

30:00.063 --> 30:01.553
I hear he's a woman now.

30:02.966 --> 30:03.990
Ooh.

30:04.067 --> 30:07.002
<i>Actually, uh, truth be told, no one knows</i>
<i>where he is right now. </i>

30:07.070 --> 30:08.662
<i>A lot of people</i>
<i>are concerned. </i>

30:11.441 --> 30:13.068
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>why that's funny. </i>

30:17.114 --> 30:19.776
<i>God, I'm going to be honest, I... I didn't plan on</i>
<i>speaking tonight. </i>

30:19.850 --> 30:22.444
<i>I... I was... I was</i>
<i>actually hoping that</i>

30:22.519 --> 30:24.783
<i>my... my assistant coach</i>
<i>would be here,</i>

30:25.222 --> 30:26.655
<i>uh, to kind of... </i>

30:29.259 --> 30:33.423
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce</i>
<i>Mike Ditka. </i>

30:35.766 --> 30:37.495
<i>It's Mike Ditka, everyone!</i>

30:39.203 --> 30:40.534
<i>Say a few words. </i>

30:41.205 --> 30:43.799
<i>Thanks, Paul, thanks, everybody. </i>
<i>It's... It's great to be here</i>

30:43.874 --> 30:45.364
<i>and, uh, gonna have</i>
<i>a lot of fun tonight. </i>

30:45.442 --> 30:46.875
<i>Paul's got the Tigers</i>
<i>on the move. </i>

30:46.944 --> 30:48.036
All right!

30:48.478 --> 30:50.343
You live long enough,
you see everything.

30:50.414 --> 30:54.714
Iron Mike and Aluminum Phil
coaching the Tigers.

30:56.386 --> 30:58.251
<i>I couldn't really hear you. </i>

30:58.322 --> 31:01.052
<i>My Super Bowl ring</i>
<i>was making too much noise. </i>

31:01.825 --> 31:02.814
Ooh.

31:03.694 --> 31:06.686
You see it, Dad? Right there,
Dad. That was a great one.

31:06.763 --> 31:08.390
<i>Read it and weep. </i>

31:10.300 --> 31:13.701
Ditka is a great coach, we understand
that, but he's a football coach.

31:13.770 --> 31:14.794
Understand?
Right.

31:14.872 --> 31:16.396
And we are
still losing, Phil.

31:16.473 --> 31:18.941
Okay, I understand
your concern about our record,

31:19.009 --> 31:21.204
but with me
it's not about win-lose.

31:21.278 --> 31:23.769
We are going to win one game
eventually, right?

31:23.847 --> 31:25.212
Well, we've had
a rocky start,

31:25.282 --> 31:28.479
but with a strong team
effort, we will win some

31:29.753 --> 31:30.981
I think.

31:31.421 --> 31:33.252
Remember,
there's no "I" in team.

31:33.390 --> 31:35.255
But there is an "I"
in win.

31:35.325 --> 31:36.383
There is an "I" in win.

31:36.460 --> 31:37.484
Hey, wait.

31:37.594 --> 31:38.583
Uh, parents,
Honey.

31:38.662 --> 31:41.324
I didn't see you step up
when the team was in need.

31:41.398 --> 31:42.490
Okay.
Okay.

31:42.566 --> 31:44.693
Phil is not the greatest
coach in the world,

31:44.768 --> 31:46.633
I'll give you that,
but at least he's trying.

31:46.703 --> 31:47.829
I can defend myself,
please.

31:47.905 --> 31:49.702
You think he enjoys losing
week after week,

31:49.773 --> 31:50.797
in front of his own son?

31:50.874 --> 31:52.899
You're making it worse.
You're making it worse.

31:52.976 --> 31:54.841
What's with the birds?
That was weird.

31:54.912 --> 31:57.039
I've got my hands full with
Hunter. I don't need a bird.

31:57.114 --> 31:59.275
Okay, you know what?
You got me. All right?

31:59.349 --> 32:00.873
The finches were
a bad idea.

32:00.951 --> 32:03.977
And I wasn't going to say this,
but I think some of them have salmonella.

32:04.054 --> 32:05.578
A fair amount, in fact.
What?

32:05.656 --> 32:08.454
I may have inadvertently
poisoned your children.

32:09.693 --> 32:11.160
You and I,
we got something going.

32:11.228 --> 32:13.753
You know, maybe we can coach
the Little League together.

32:13.830 --> 32:15.195
You really think that, huh? Yeah.

32:15.265 --> 32:16.493
Coach Ditka?
Yes?

32:16.566 --> 32:21.526
Hi. Um, uh, our son, Byong Sun, he's
very shy and I was just wondering...

32:21.605 --> 32:23.334
Sure. Yeah, I'd be glad to.

32:23.407 --> 32:24.738
Thank you so much.

32:24.808 --> 32:25.866
How do you spell that?

32:25.943 --> 32:29.276
It's, uh, Byong Sun.
B- Y...

32:29.346 --> 32:30.335
I think I got it.

32:30.414 --> 32:31.574
Oh, oh, okay,

32:31.648 --> 32:33.013
Okay?
Thank you.

32:33.083 --> 32:34.015
Bye-bye.

32:34.084 --> 32:35.073
Thanks, Phil.

32:35.152 --> 32:37.382
Yeah. They're great.

32:37.454 --> 32:38.443
Just a wonderful couple.

32:38.522 --> 32:39.955
Yeah.

32:41.158 --> 32:42.591
Bing Bong?

32:43.060 --> 32:44.721
Hey, Philly.

32:44.962 --> 32:45.929
Yeah, Dad.

32:45.996 --> 32:48.396
Hey, I've been
meaning to talk to you

32:48.465 --> 32:51.161
about this Ditka thing.
I don't like it one bit.

32:51.234 --> 32:52.531
Yeah, well, he's right here.

32:52.602 --> 32:53.864
I'm not blind.

32:53.937 --> 32:55.427
What, are you trying
to stick it to the old man?

32:55.505 --> 32:57.370
You go to my mortal enemy
for help?

32:57.441 --> 32:59.204
That's no way
to talk about your neighbor.

32:59.276 --> 33:00.208
Oh, yeah?

33:00.277 --> 33:01.369
He's right.

33:01.445 --> 33:04.039
I hated him from the first
time I laid eyes on him.

33:04.114 --> 33:07.015
Maybe even before that, because I
know you're the guy that wrote

33:07.084 --> 33:08.949
"Ditka sucks" on my driveway.

33:09.019 --> 33:10.179
What are you
even doing here?

33:10.253 --> 33:12.244
You're just doing this
to get under my skin.

33:12.322 --> 33:13.653
I'm glad you figured it out.

33:13.724 --> 33:14.986
And I'm getting under
your skin.

33:15.058 --> 33:17.049
It's gonna get a lot
worse before it gets better.

33:17.127 --> 33:18.685
In your dreams.

33:19.329 --> 33:20.296
Ooh.

33:20.364 --> 33:23.492
Hey, why don't you take that
pretty young wife of yours and go home?

33:23.567 --> 33:24.625
What did you call her?

33:24.701 --> 33:26.464
Hey guys, please.
It's a compliment.

33:26.536 --> 33:28.026
I said she's lovely
and she's young.

33:28.105 --> 33:30.164
She's the light of my life.
You don't talk about her.

33:30.240 --> 33:31.229
I go home when I want.

33:31.308 --> 33:33.242
It's Mike Ditka. He's big.
Stay out of this.

33:33.310 --> 33:35.471
I'll tell you for
the last time. Hit the road!

33:35.545 --> 33:36.603
Who's gonna make me?
I am.

33:36.680 --> 33:37.704
You're acting like... Oh!

33:38.648 --> 33:41.446
I took a punch from Hall
of Famer, Mike Ditka,

33:41.518 --> 33:43.315
and I did not go down.

33:43.387 --> 33:45.753
Sure, I wobbled a bit,
but I did not go down.

33:45.822 --> 33:48.518
That Ditka has fists
like a small truck.

33:48.925 --> 33:50.392
Come here.

33:53.864 --> 33:54.853
Okay.

33:56.166 --> 33:57.861
Yeah, you need to relax.

33:57.934 --> 33:59.333
Yeah.

33:59.403 --> 34:01.530
You should've seen the
look on my dad's face.

34:01.605 --> 34:02.594
Priceless.

34:02.706 --> 34:04.298
'Cause that punch
was meant for him,

34:04.374 --> 34:06.103
that's what
makes me feel so good.

34:06.176 --> 34:08.735
Okay, Phil,
can we please not talk

34:08.812 --> 34:10.905
about your dad or Ditka tonight? Please?

34:10.981 --> 34:13.949
I... I... You just need
to relax.

34:14.284 --> 34:15.409
You're right.
Yeah.

34:15.485 --> 34:17.009
I'm sorry.
Okay.

34:17.487 --> 34:18.784
Yeah, I just get...

34:24.661 --> 34:27.186
I'm in
way over my head.

34:27.731 --> 34:29.926
I got punched in the face
and it hurt.

34:30.467 --> 34:32.697
Honey, come on,
the kids need a real coach.

34:32.768 --> 34:33.667
Phil?

34:33.737 --> 34:34.704
Yeah?

34:34.771 --> 34:35.703
I love you.

34:35.772 --> 34:38.138
What does that have
to do with anything?

34:38.208 --> 34:41.371
Okay. I quit. I give up. I
give up. You go talk to Ditka.

34:41.445 --> 34:44.676
What for? He scares me.

34:45.348 --> 34:47.782
Have you ever
looked into his eyes?

34:47.984 --> 34:49.281
Or at his hair?

34:49.351 --> 34:51.717
Well, he's been coaching
for a long time.

34:51.788 --> 34:53.187
Share your feelings
with him.

34:53.255 --> 34:55.190
You want me to share my
feelings of inadequacy

34:55.257 --> 34:56.315
with Mike Ditka?

34:56.393 --> 34:58.190
Uh. What else can you do?

35:00.630 --> 35:02.188
Okay. You're right.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.664
You're right.
You're always right.

35:05.735 --> 35:08.602
I'm sorry.
I'll go talk to him.

35:08.672 --> 35:09.764
Okay?
Okay.

35:09.840 --> 35:11.102
And, Phil...
Yeah?

35:11.174 --> 35:13.438
Try not to cry
in front of him.

35:16.213 --> 35:19.273
Hey, hey, get a grip
on yourself, okay? Man up.

35:19.349 --> 35:20.338
I can't.

35:20.417 --> 35:22.214
You better or else
I'm gettin' out of here.

35:22.285 --> 35:23.877
Here, drink this coffee.

35:23.954 --> 35:26.582
I don't like coffee.
It's a vasoconstrictor.

35:26.656 --> 35:28.954
Hey, coffee is the number
one drink in the world.

35:29.025 --> 35:30.117
Everybody drinks it.

35:30.193 --> 35:32.525
Even little kids in Mexico
drink coffee.

35:32.596 --> 35:34.655
Well, I'm not a little kid
in Mexico.

35:34.731 --> 35:38.132
Okay? In fact, I
don't know who I am.

35:38.201 --> 35:42.467
I took a long hard look at myself in
the mirror, and you know what I saw?

35:42.539 --> 35:43.528
What?

35:43.607 --> 35:44.631
Nothing.

35:44.708 --> 35:46.335
My dad, he's something.

35:46.409 --> 35:49.572
I mean, I've never lived
up to my dad's expectations.

35:49.646 --> 35:53.446
And to top it all off, I'm
letting Sam down. My own son!

35:54.417 --> 35:55.384
Ah. Hey!

35:55.452 --> 35:56.544
Ow!

35:56.620 --> 35:58.417
Knock it off.
I don't care about that.

35:58.488 --> 36:00.251
Why is everyone
slapping me lately?

36:00.323 --> 36:02.723
Drink the coffee. It'll
make you feel better.

36:02.792 --> 36:04.783
I don't... I don't like...

36:07.931 --> 36:09.728
Um, uh,

36:09.799 --> 36:11.733
Yeah. Uh-huh.
Yeah, it's good.

36:11.801 --> 36:13.462
Picks you up.
It calms you down.

36:13.537 --> 36:16.062
It's the lifeblood that
drives the dreams of champions.

36:16.139 --> 36:17.128
Oh.

36:17.207 --> 36:18.902
Now, you gotta tell me
the problem,

36:18.975 --> 36:21.409
but if you cry,
I'm out of here.

36:21.478 --> 36:24.413
I... I can't do it. I can't
coach. I can't beat my old man.

36:24.481 --> 36:27.143
You can beat your dad!
He's just a man.

36:27.217 --> 36:29.276
This coaching business,
Paul, is tough stuff.

36:29.352 --> 36:30.250
Phil.

36:30.320 --> 36:31.844
Whatever. It's tough stuff.

36:31.922 --> 36:33.787
And when you lose,
it all comes down on you.

36:33.857 --> 36:35.484
But listen, when you
put it all together,

36:35.559 --> 36:37.584
and you win, it's the
greatest feeling in the world.

36:37.661 --> 36:39.060
It's like
winning the Super Bowl.

36:39.129 --> 36:40.391
Really?
Yeah, really.

36:40.463 --> 36:42.454
Except, you saddled me
with a bunch of stiffs.

36:42.532 --> 36:44.432
Take me 3 years to get
these guys shaped up.

36:44.501 --> 36:45.525
I'm sorry.

36:45.602 --> 36:47.229
But I got a good idea.

36:47.304 --> 36:50.933
Maybe we take a shortcut, stick
it to your old man real good.

36:51.007 --> 36:54.534
But in order to do that, we
gotta get some fresh meat.

36:54.611 --> 36:55.578
Okay.

36:55.645 --> 36:57.704
Keepa this up,
you get nowhere in meat.

36:58.949 --> 37:00.814
Maria, the <i>prosciutto. </i>
It's almost 10:00.

37:00.884 --> 37:01.908
Okay.

37:01.985 --> 37:03.009
Umberto!

37:03.086 --> 37:04.075
Hey, coach.

37:04.154 --> 37:08.090
Don't you worry, I
got you bratwurst all ready.

37:09.292 --> 37:10.486
Hello.

37:10.560 --> 37:11.549
Beautiful <i>. Grazie. </i>

37:14.164 --> 37:15.153
Right.

37:15.232 --> 37:16.631
Are your nephews
working today?

37:16.700 --> 37:18.031
Uh, <i>si,</i> in the back.

37:18.101 --> 37:20.035
Go back and take
a look at these guys.

37:20.737 --> 37:21.965
Really?
Yeah, yeah.

37:22.038 --> 37:23.062
Maria?

37:35.819 --> 37:37.377
Wow!

37:37.687 --> 37:38.779
Oh, they're terrific.

37:38.855 --> 37:40.789
Pretty impressive, huh?

37:42.592 --> 37:44.025
Yes!

37:44.861 --> 37:48.592
These kids are the right age, and
they live in the district. Why not?

37:50.900 --> 37:53.494
Uh, excuse me, mister.
Your... Your two nephews...

37:53.570 --> 37:54.502
<i>Si?</i>

37:54.571 --> 37:57.597
Uh, would... would they be
interested in, uh, playing soccer?

37:57.674 --> 37:59.073
<i>Massimo e Gian Piero?</i>

37:59.142 --> 38:00.166
Yeah.

38:00.243 --> 38:02.040
No, no, no,
they not play soccer.

38:02.112 --> 38:04.444
They come here to apprentice me. Yeah.

38:04.514 --> 38:06.505
They have too much
to learn.

38:06.583 --> 38:09.211
You know, English, meat.
Too much.

38:09.286 --> 38:10.719
So they don't
play soccer at all?

38:14.090 --> 38:16.149
They could learn
from the American kids.

38:16.226 --> 38:17.693
Don't look like that to me.
Please.

38:20.063 --> 38:22.327
They play with American kids,
they... they pick up English.

38:22.399 --> 38:25.232
A lot... lot of famous athletes
have learned English through sports.

38:25.302 --> 38:26.462
Sammy Sosa.
Yeah.

38:26.536 --> 38:28.333
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

38:28.872 --> 38:30.203
Leon Spinks, uh,
Elvis Costello.

38:30.273 --> 38:31.171
No. No.

38:31.441 --> 38:33.773
BjÃ¶rn Borg, Mark Spitz.

38:33.843 --> 38:35.868
Let the kids
have some fun.

38:37.247 --> 38:38.612
Okay! Okay!

38:39.582 --> 38:40.606
Great.

38:40.684 --> 38:44.518
But remember.
Meat first, then soccer.

38:44.587 --> 38:45.576
Yes!

38:45.655 --> 38:47.953
I told you. Every great thing
in life starts with a brat.

38:49.492 --> 38:50.686
Tigers, huddle up.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.660
Get in here. Come on.
Get in here, guys.

38:52.729 --> 38:54.219
Come on. Everybody up.

38:54.297 --> 38:58.734
I know we're on a five-game losing
streak, but I've got good news.

38:58.802 --> 39:02.329
Umberto. I've got two
new players joining the team.

39:03.506 --> 39:06.475
Guys, Gian Piero and Massimo.

39:07.177 --> 39:09.008
Now, these boys
are from Italy, okay?

39:09.079 --> 39:11.343
So they don't
speak English that well.

39:11.414 --> 39:13.439
We're all gonna
help them learn.

39:13.583 --> 39:15.608
They're apprentice butchers.

39:15.685 --> 39:18.586
Did the blacksmiths and the
candlestick makers not make it?

39:18.655 --> 39:19.553
Shut up.

39:19.622 --> 39:22.090
I come back,
pick up 5:00.

39:22.158 --> 39:23.352
5:00. You got it. Okay.

39:27.864 --> 39:28.956
<i>Prima</i> what?

39:29.032 --> 39:30.966
Meat first. First!

39:31.034 --> 39:32.058
Ah, meat first.
Yes, <i>si. </i>

39:32.135 --> 39:33.261
Yes, we love meat.

39:36.473 --> 39:38.407
You fellows, put these on.

39:38.475 --> 39:40.875
Yeah, try them on
and, uh, take the field.

39:40.944 --> 39:42.605
Take-a-the-field.

40:02.532 --> 40:03.999
All right, come on!

40:06.469 --> 40:07.731
Massimo!

40:10.940 --> 40:12.168
Gian Piero!

40:13.576 --> 40:14.736
Follow it.

40:15.478 --> 40:17.002
Wow! Crazy!

40:22.352 --> 40:23.341
Whoa.

40:26.289 --> 40:28.052
Yes! Yes! Yes!

40:29.659 --> 40:31.650
Yeah, team!

40:31.728 --> 40:35.391
New game plan. Get the
ball to the Italians.

41:36.860 --> 41:39.192
Come on. Guys, bring it in.

41:40.864 --> 41:44.095
2, 4, 6, 8, who do we appreciate?

41:44.167 --> 41:46.431
Generals! Generals! Yeah!

41:47.470 --> 41:51.304
I just got excited.
Nice job. Nice job.

41:51.808 --> 41:53.036
Pizza at my house.

41:53.109 --> 41:54.770
We won, Dad.
We finally won.

41:54.844 --> 41:55.936
We broke the Tiger curse.

41:56.012 --> 41:56.876
Yes.

42:02.952 --> 42:04.214
Okay, no biting, come on.

42:04.287 --> 42:07.882
Guys? Oh. Settle down.
Everyone.

42:07.957 --> 42:09.151
Get enough pizza?

42:09.225 --> 42:11.853
You definitely had enough
candy, I can tell that.

42:11.928 --> 42:14.726
I just... Ow! That got me
right in the nipple.

42:15.231 --> 42:17.631
Hey, guys, I just wanna say:

42:17.700 --> 42:20.726
"Congratulations
on the Tigers' first victory!"

42:23.640 --> 42:26.040
There's more
where that came from.

42:26.175 --> 42:28.575
That's right. You guys,
you all played great.

42:28.845 --> 42:32.042
So did Gian Piero and Massimo who
couldn't be here because:

42:32.115 --> 42:33.241
Meat comes first!

42:33.316 --> 42:34.374
Right.

42:34.717 --> 42:36.116
Got you a gift.

42:36.185 --> 42:38.312
Soccer Dan Instructional DVD.

42:38.454 --> 42:40.615
We're gonna keep learning
as we go.

42:40.690 --> 42:43.022
This is where we're really
gonna hone our skills.

42:43.092 --> 42:45.959
This will take us
to the next level. Study it.

42:46.029 --> 42:49.430
Watch it. I only watched it for 5 minutes,
I already... I already learned this.

42:49.499 --> 42:50.796
This is called "up and over. "

42:52.802 --> 42:54.770
You can learn things like...

42:55.772 --> 42:57.831
Maybe back over here.

43:01.311 --> 43:03.438
Fakes left,
fakes right, he shoots!

43:04.547 --> 43:06.947
What is going on in there?

43:07.083 --> 43:09.483
Guys, I said no playing soccer
in the house.

43:09.752 --> 43:11.947
You did. You said it a lot.

43:12.021 --> 43:13.010
Who did that?

43:13.089 --> 43:14.056
He did.

43:14.123 --> 43:15.454
He did!

43:15.525 --> 43:17.618
What? Nah!

43:17.694 --> 43:19.355
Kill Phil!

43:20.997 --> 43:21.986
Okay.

43:27.103 --> 43:28.764
Hey! All right!

43:34.143 --> 43:38.204
Goal!

43:49.092 --> 43:50.616
Why don't our
two new players

43:50.693 --> 43:51.990
speak any English?

43:52.295 --> 43:53.728
Because they're
Italian.

43:53.830 --> 43:55.195
You didn't know English

43:55.264 --> 43:56.697
that whole first
year of your life.

43:56.766 --> 43:57.858
You had that
made-up, like,

43:57.934 --> 43:59.561
goo-goo,
gaa-gaa baby language.

43:59.636 --> 44:00.762
It was
really irritating.

44:00.837 --> 44:01.826
Dad.

44:01.904 --> 44:03.201
You learned.

44:05.875 --> 44:07.365
What's that haunting aroma?

44:08.077 --> 44:09.601
I don't know.

44:16.886 --> 44:18.012
Hello.
Hi, there.

44:18.087 --> 44:20.487
Hi, uh,
my name is Phil.

44:20.556 --> 44:22.421
This is my son,
Sam,

44:22.492 --> 44:24.221
and I... I'm brand new
to coffee.

44:24.293 --> 44:25.385
So I don't want too much.

44:25.461 --> 44:26.519
Okay.

44:26.629 --> 44:29.655
Can you take half of the
regular version of the coffee

44:29.732 --> 44:33.065
and mix it with half of
the decaffeinated version?

44:33.136 --> 44:36.128
Or is that... is that
just too weird a thing

44:36.873 --> 44:38.135
to ask for?

44:38.841 --> 44:39.865
Half-Caff?

44:39.942 --> 44:41.136
Right.
Half-Caff.

44:41.377 --> 44:42.344
Half-Caff.

44:42.412 --> 44:44.004
We're... We're gonna have
a Half-Caff.

44:44.714 --> 44:46.181
We're gonna have
Half-Caff.

44:46.816 --> 44:47.805
Yeah.

44:48.317 --> 44:49.443
And, a Half-Caff.

44:49.585 --> 44:50.552
That's me.

44:51.688 --> 44:53.815
Mother of Pearl!
That is hot!

44:55.191 --> 44:56.385
That was hot.

44:56.459 --> 44:58.086
Should have
waited for the jacket.

44:58.728 --> 45:00.389
Yeah. I know,
I got too eager.

45:00.963 --> 45:01.895
Another Half-Caff.

45:01.964 --> 45:02.896
Another Half-Caff.

45:05.902 --> 45:06.891
Whoa!

45:07.370 --> 45:08.359
Whoa.

45:08.705 --> 45:09.899
Uh, you.

45:11.140 --> 45:12.402
Head.

45:13.910 --> 45:15.309
Okay. Go.

45:20.183 --> 45:22.014
OK.
Foot on ball, and pull. Go.

45:22.151 --> 45:23.175
OK.

45:25.488 --> 45:26.750
Yeah!

45:27.490 --> 45:29.458
Tap. Pull.

45:30.059 --> 45:30.991
Okay?

45:31.227 --> 45:32.421
Tap and pull?

45:32.495 --> 45:33.484
Yes.

45:41.537 --> 45:42.834
<i>Mama mia. </i>

45:42.905 --> 45:45.305
You're a real duffer,
you know?

45:51.214 --> 45:54.581
I'm not worthy.
I'm not worthy.

45:54.984 --> 45:57.282
How do you say
"pizza" in Italian?

45:57.854 --> 45:59.549
Pizza. Pizza.

46:00.022 --> 46:01.683
How do you
say "spaghetti?"

46:01.824 --> 46:03.519
Spaghetti.

46:03.960 --> 46:05.552
Italian is easy.

46:06.295 --> 46:08.286
Thank you.
Hello.

46:08.364 --> 46:09.262
Hello.

46:09.332 --> 46:10.356
Where're you
from?

46:10.433 --> 46:11.422
Australia.

46:11.567 --> 46:12.591
Oh, that's
a lovely accent.

46:12.668 --> 46:13.600
Thank you.

46:13.669 --> 46:15.068
You still waiting
for your coffee?

46:15.138 --> 46:16.070
Yes.

46:16.139 --> 46:18.835
Make sure you get one of these
sleeves. I burned myself last time.

46:18.908 --> 46:19.875
Thanks for the tip.

46:19.942 --> 46:21.569
It's something you
don't know at first.

46:25.414 --> 46:27.609
Would you look at
those Italians go?

46:30.286 --> 46:32.413
Oh, God, I'm
in bad shape for 11.

46:34.023 --> 46:36.082
Worm! Worm!

46:38.060 --> 46:40.153
Okay, Bucky,
it was, like, so awesome.

46:40.229 --> 46:41.218
You should have
saw it.

46:41.297 --> 46:42.730
They just score and
score and score

46:42.799 --> 46:44.460
and score and score
and score and score.

46:44.534 --> 46:46.434
It was all too much,
I had to take an Advil,

46:46.502 --> 46:48.436
and I'm like, I got,
like, a headache almost.

46:48.504 --> 46:50.267
You should get some
Italians on your team.

46:50.339 --> 46:52.637
It's like ba-boom!
Ba-boom!

46:52.742 --> 46:55.438
Are... Are you guys getting
any playing time, like...

46:55.745 --> 46:56.769
No.

47:06.222 --> 47:07.189
French Roast.

47:07.256 --> 47:08.188
Right.

47:11.093 --> 47:12.720
Guatemalan with
a little Ethiopian.

47:12.795 --> 47:14.194
Absolutely.

47:17.767 --> 47:18.791
Aw.

47:18.868 --> 47:20.358
That's... That's
not coffee.

47:20.436 --> 47:21.926
That's my Russian vodka!

47:24.640 --> 47:25.607
Jack!

47:25.675 --> 47:26.642
No! Mom!

47:26.709 --> 47:27.937
UV index
is very high today.

47:28.010 --> 47:29.534
I'm in the middle
of a game, come on!

47:29.612 --> 47:31.239
I know. But your skin's
more important.

47:31.314 --> 47:32.303
Mom, come on.

47:32.381 --> 47:33.643
Okay, go!

47:33.716 --> 47:35.775
Keep passing
to the Italians!

47:45.561 --> 47:46.960
Go Tigers!

47:51.100 --> 47:53.967
Don't forget
the meatballs!

48:01.244 --> 48:02.472
Hey, hey!

48:02.545 --> 48:03.944
Hey! Here we go!

48:04.780 --> 48:05.838
Hey.

48:07.984 --> 48:09.349
Are you serious?

48:09.952 --> 48:11.419
I'll go change
in my car.

48:11.487 --> 48:12.647
Hurry up.

48:23.699 --> 48:24.996
Yeah.

48:26.903 --> 48:28.063
Hey, Philly.

48:29.205 --> 48:30.194
Smells good.

48:30.273 --> 48:31.240
Yeah.

48:31.307 --> 48:32.467
They're
sirloin burgers.

48:32.541 --> 48:33.530
No, I mean the air.

48:33.609 --> 48:34.598
What?

48:34.677 --> 48:36.076
Smells fresh.
Yeah.

48:36.145 --> 48:37.169
What do you
mean?

48:37.246 --> 48:38.235
Beautiful day.

48:38.314 --> 48:39.338
Yeah.

48:39.415 --> 48:41.280
Couldn't ask for
a more beautiful day.

48:41.417 --> 48:43.282
I'm feeling
fully alive.

48:46.489 --> 48:47.854
Tigers have won
five in a row.

48:47.924 --> 48:50.552
The Italians and Ditka
have won five in a row.

48:50.760 --> 48:51.727
We're 500.

48:51.861 --> 48:53.123
Yeah,
we're 1,000.

48:53.796 --> 48:55.354
Look, Dad,
I got a feeling

48:55.431 --> 48:57.194
we're gonna make
it to the finals.

48:57.266 --> 48:58.699
You what?
Gonna go where?

48:58.768 --> 49:00.167
Yeah.

49:00.269 --> 49:01.293
You're serious?

49:01.370 --> 49:02.803
Yeah, you bet I'm serious.

49:08.344 --> 49:11.142
Looks like somebody needs to be
taken down a couple of notches.

49:11.213 --> 49:12.339
What is the law, Phil?

49:12.415 --> 49:13.382
Stop it, Dad.

49:13.449 --> 49:14.848
The law says:

49:14.917 --> 49:17.010
"You shall never beat
the old man at anything. "

49:17.086 --> 49:18.110
Just serve.

49:18.187 --> 49:19.154
Okay.

49:28.197 --> 49:30.631
Oh, foul, foul, foul!
Come on!

49:31.467 --> 49:32.900
You a little klutzy?

49:32.969 --> 49:34.027
All right.

49:34.236 --> 49:35.794
Okay,
here we go.

49:37.540 --> 49:38.837
Pooh! Boom!

49:42.578 --> 49:44.637
Sorry.
Huevos Rancheros.

49:45.181 --> 49:46.239
You wanna quit now?

49:46.315 --> 49:47.475
No, no, no, no, no.

49:52.321 --> 49:53.310
Oh!

49:59.862 --> 50:00.954
<i>OlÃ©!</i>

50:08.971 --> 50:09.995
You okay?

50:10.072 --> 50:11.130
Serve it.

50:18.948 --> 50:21.610
Phil? Honey?

50:22.351 --> 50:24.911
Don't talk to me,
it's father-son time!

50:31.794 --> 50:33.193
Come on.

50:40.269 --> 50:42.863
Somebody should be
videotapin' this.

50:44.073 --> 50:45.631
Ooh. Who's your trainer?

50:45.841 --> 50:47.308
Stop talking and serve!

50:47.810 --> 50:49.334
Maniac.

50:58.988 --> 51:00.751
Now, I bury you.

51:01.424 --> 51:02.391
Bury you!

51:02.758 --> 51:03.747
Bury you!

51:04.326 --> 51:05.315
Bury you!

51:08.564 --> 51:09.553
Yeah.

51:10.066 --> 51:11.465
I'll see you inside.

51:11.534 --> 51:12.660
Okay.

51:23.312 --> 51:25.371
That's the best I've
ever played against him.

51:25.448 --> 51:28.212
Yeah, it didn't grind
the barbecue to a halt at all.

51:29.085 --> 51:30.109
Ow.

51:30.186 --> 51:32.950
You made an excellent impression
on your son, by the way.

51:35.191 --> 51:36.715
Hey, I... I almost had you.

51:40.196 --> 51:42.721
What do you call that again,
when you almost win?

51:42.798 --> 51:45.494
Oh, yeah, yeah, losing.

51:55.878 --> 51:57.675
I'll tell you, Dad.

51:57.746 --> 52:00.010
The Tigers are
making it to the finals.

52:00.116 --> 52:01.378
That ain't
never gonna happen.

52:01.450 --> 52:02.508
Oh, yeah?

52:03.052 --> 52:04.417
Never.

52:07.223 --> 52:08.417
You wanna make a bet?

52:08.491 --> 52:09.480
Yeah.

52:09.592 --> 52:10.581
Yeah?

52:10.659 --> 52:12.684
Fine. Okay.
We'll bet.

52:13.829 --> 52:15.262
I beat you,

52:15.331 --> 52:18.164
and you sell that break-even
snake-oil stand of yours.

52:19.301 --> 52:20.962
And you're gonna
come to work for me.

52:21.103 --> 52:22.764
No. No, I'm not
gonna work for you.

52:22.838 --> 52:23.827
Uh? Oh.

52:28.310 --> 52:30.471
Okay, okay,
okay, okay. Stop.

52:31.347 --> 52:33.042
Okay. But if I win...

52:33.382 --> 52:34.349
What?

52:36.051 --> 52:37.643
I get the PelÃ© ball.

52:38.521 --> 52:39.647
Do what?

52:39.722 --> 52:41.280
If I beat you
in the finals,

52:41.690 --> 52:45.353
PelÃ© ball.
It's mine. I get it.

52:48.998 --> 52:51.398
<i>Here comes PelÃ©. </i>

52:51.467 --> 52:54.061
<i>A little high</i>
<i>and into the crowd. </i>

52:54.970 --> 52:56.301
I got it! I got it!

52:56.372 --> 52:57.566
No. I got it.

52:59.208 --> 53:00.266
Yeah!

53:00.409 --> 53:01.467
Dad?

53:02.144 --> 53:03.168
What?

53:03.245 --> 53:04.269
Can I have the ball?

53:04.346 --> 53:06.371
For what?
I caught it. Why?

53:06.448 --> 53:08.040
You get
the next one.

53:08.851 --> 53:11.911
If I beat you in the finals,
I get the PelÃ© ball.

53:13.589 --> 53:14.647
For the day.

53:14.790 --> 53:16.018
Forever.

53:16.225 --> 53:19.023
No way, Jose.
No, sir. No way.

53:25.234 --> 53:26.633
All right. All right.

53:27.269 --> 53:28.327
Yeah?

53:28.404 --> 53:30.065
We got ourselves a bet,
okay?

53:30.139 --> 53:31.299
All right.

53:31.607 --> 53:32.904
Good.
Good.

53:32.975 --> 53:34.272
Good.
Yes.

53:34.376 --> 53:35.343
See you tomorrow.

53:35.411 --> 53:36.309
Okay. Good.

53:43.252 --> 53:45.812
Yeah, I think we're gonna
have to cut you off, sir.

53:47.489 --> 53:48.513
Ooh.

53:48.591 --> 53:50.388
Not a chance.
Gotta go feed the meter.

53:50.459 --> 53:51.824
Line 'em up.

53:57.700 --> 53:58.860
Your wife told me about

53:58.934 --> 54:00.424
the bet you made
with your old man.

54:00.502 --> 54:01.969
Oh, yeah?
What of it?

54:02.338 --> 54:03.327
I think maybe

54:03.405 --> 54:04.736
you're getting
ahead of yourself.

54:04.807 --> 54:06.468
We played the easy
part of our schedule.

54:06.542 --> 54:07.839
We gotta win
five games in a row

54:07.910 --> 54:09.343
just to make
the semifinals.

54:09.411 --> 54:10.469
So maybe you should...

54:10.546 --> 54:12.309
Maybe you should
worry more about the team

54:12.381 --> 54:13.541
and less
about the schedule.

54:13.616 --> 54:14.605
What?

54:14.683 --> 54:16.310
There's a lot of
slothfulness going on.

54:16.385 --> 54:17.352
Slothfulness?

54:17.419 --> 54:18.511
Yeah.

54:18.587 --> 54:20.020
Let's go, Tigers.
Bring it in.

54:21.156 --> 54:22.555
Bring it in, guys.

54:23.092 --> 54:24.423
Let's go.

54:24.893 --> 54:25.951
Grab some bench.

54:26.028 --> 54:28.155
Look how much time it takes
for them to come in.

54:28.230 --> 54:29.993
Take a seat.
Let's go.

54:30.699 --> 54:32.030
Okay, guys.

54:32.835 --> 54:35.167
I had you come
here early today,

54:35.304 --> 54:37.636
so we could talk
about some sloppy play.

54:39.441 --> 54:41.102
It's come
to my attention

54:41.176 --> 54:43.110
that lately,
I've noticed

54:43.178 --> 54:45.476
a general,
blatant disregard

54:45.547 --> 54:46.809
for our game plan.

54:48.884 --> 54:49.942
Ambrose.

54:50.019 --> 54:50.986
Yeah?

54:51.053 --> 54:52.543
I saw a bunch of
nonsense out there.

54:52.621 --> 54:54.646
What was going through your
head out there last week?

54:54.723 --> 54:56.281
I was breaking
my back for you, Coach,

54:56.358 --> 54:57.950
because of my love
for the game.

54:58.027 --> 54:59.153
Liar!

54:59.595 --> 55:00.892
Jack.
What?

55:00.963 --> 55:02.692
Who are you supposed
to pass the ball to?

55:02.765 --> 55:03.732
The Italians.

55:03.799 --> 55:04.857
Right. Alex, when?

55:04.933 --> 55:06.457
When I come in
contact with the ball.

55:06.535 --> 55:08.696
The instant you come
in contact with the ball.

55:08.771 --> 55:09.897
That's our strategy.

55:09.972 --> 55:11.837
It's one of the many plays
we've worked out.

55:11.907 --> 55:13.602
It's the only play
we've worked out.

55:13.676 --> 55:15.701
How many sarcastic pills
did you take this morning?

55:15.778 --> 55:16.802
Coach,
I'm just saying...

55:16.879 --> 55:17.903
"But, Coach... "

55:22.951 --> 55:24.111
You gotta
lighten up.

55:24.186 --> 55:25.312
He started it.

55:27.056 --> 55:28.990
I seem to remember
a certain little boy

55:29.058 --> 55:30.958
who was very
sad when he lost.

55:31.026 --> 55:34.052
And that same little boy
was very happy when he won.

55:34.897 --> 55:36.387
I'm doing this
for you, okay?

55:36.465 --> 55:37.932
So that
we can have fun.

55:38.300 --> 55:40.393
Right? Fun. Okay.

55:41.036 --> 55:42.401
Yeah.

55:42.738 --> 55:44.069
Hey,
you're... you're late.

55:44.139 --> 55:45.766
Wh-Wh-Where've
you been?

55:46.241 --> 55:47.902
Uh,
there's a problem.

55:47.976 --> 55:49.568
Wait, where's Gian
Piero and Massimo?

55:49.678 --> 55:51.145
We were supposed
to pick them up.

55:51.280 --> 55:52.747
Hey, what's going on?

55:57.186 --> 55:58.744
Where are my Italians?

55:59.221 --> 56:00.210
Huh?

56:00.456 --> 56:03.357
I can't afford to
lose this one, Umberto.

56:03.692 --> 56:05.785
Meat is now.
Me and the boy will work

56:05.861 --> 56:07.624
all day to get
this order done.

56:07.696 --> 56:09.561
It's a big, big order.

56:09.631 --> 56:12.429
No, no, no. I... Believe me,
I know. Meat comes first.

56:12.501 --> 56:13.468
Sure.

56:13.535 --> 56:15.901
I've only heard it about
a thousand times from you.

56:15.971 --> 56:18.769
I can't talk to you.
Here, you take this.

56:18.841 --> 56:20.638
I'm really
getting sick and tired of

56:20.709 --> 56:22.267
"the meat comes first. "
I'm sorry.

56:22.344 --> 56:23.402
# Happy birthday ##

56:23.479 --> 56:24.776
Quiet please!

56:25.080 --> 56:26.741
Shut up!
I'm on the phone.

56:26.815 --> 56:28.407
You're not
the only one in the park.

56:28.484 --> 56:30.543
You know, at a certain point,

56:30.619 --> 56:32.109
these kids just
wanna play soccer.

56:32.187 --> 56:33.711
They don't care
about the meat.

56:33.789 --> 56:36.656
Uh, do I have to say that?
'Cause that's gonna cause

56:36.792 --> 56:39.158
some kind of
a dramatic situation here.

56:39.228 --> 56:41.321
What are you saying, eh?

56:41.430 --> 56:43.728
What? Hello? Umberto?

56:43.866 --> 56:45.231
Umberto?

56:48.003 --> 56:49.527
All right, guys.

56:49.638 --> 56:52.368
We got 25 minutes
and a lot of beef to cut.

56:52.441 --> 56:53.806
Let's get to it.

56:55.844 --> 56:57.903
Watch me, boys, I'm goin' in!

56:58.447 --> 57:00.210
Whoa!

57:39.688 --> 57:41.849
We made it.
Sorry we're late.

57:42.658 --> 57:43.647
Hey, Stew.

57:43.725 --> 57:45.056
Hey.

57:46.128 --> 57:48.824
Uh. Listen. One of... One of my
guys didn't bring his socks.

57:48.897 --> 57:50.831
So, we forfeit.

57:52.167 --> 57:54.795
You hear that, Vultures,
we forfeit. Let's go.

57:54.870 --> 57:56.201
Come on! Run!

57:56.271 --> 57:57.431
Hurry, run quickly!

57:57.506 --> 57:59.337
Run! Run to the car! Run!

57:59.408 --> 58:01.171
Don't look back! Run!

58:01.944 --> 58:02.968
We won!

58:03.045 --> 58:04.069
We won.

58:06.281 --> 58:09.375
Two, four, six, eight,
who do we appreciate?

58:09.451 --> 58:11.214
Vultures. Vultures.

58:11.286 --> 58:12.583
Yeah!

58:12.721 --> 58:14.018
Good job, guys.

58:19.127 --> 58:21.061
Phil, it's freezing out here.

58:21.730 --> 58:23.425
It's not Phil.
It's Coach Weston.

58:23.565 --> 58:25.294
And it's not
freezing out here.

58:25.434 --> 58:27.561
Then why did you
build a fire?

58:27.970 --> 58:30.768
Because fire is
the stuff of warriors.

58:31.607 --> 58:34.007
And that's what we are,
right? Warriors?

58:35.043 --> 58:37.011
The Hopi Indians
called fire...

58:41.650 --> 58:43.982
Coach, what are we
doing out here, anyway?

58:44.052 --> 58:46.850
We're bonding.
We're becoming a team.

58:47.956 --> 58:50.686
Surviving the elements,
here in the backyard.

58:51.226 --> 58:53.490
Coach, did you order
the pizzas yet?

58:53.629 --> 58:55.893
In due time, Connor.
In due time.

58:56.899 --> 58:59.163
However,
I want all of you to know

58:59.701 --> 59:01.498
if the pizzas don't arrive,

59:01.970 --> 59:03.437
I've already
made the decision

59:03.505 --> 59:05.132
that we will eat Byong Sun.

59:08.076 --> 59:09.634
All right.
We're not gonna eat him.

59:09.711 --> 59:12.271
But he does look delicious,
you have to admit, right,

59:12.347 --> 59:13.905
if we had to eat someone?

59:13.982 --> 59:16.041
Dad, you're
getting a little creepy.

59:16.184 --> 59:18.277
I know,
let's all bay at the moon.

59:18.554 --> 59:19.578
What?

59:19.655 --> 59:20.849
You know, howl like a wolf.

59:27.863 --> 59:29.490
Shut up out there!

59:29.631 --> 59:31.258
You shut up in there!

59:31.533 --> 59:33.831
Come on, everyone.
Bay at the moon.

59:54.656 --> 59:56.123
Ooh, I don't know.

59:56.191 --> 59:57.920
The Irish Cream
sounds good, huh?

59:57.993 --> 59:59.585
What's that?

59:59.661 --> 01:00:01.993
Uh, it's cream
and it's, uh, it's Irish.

01:00:02.064 --> 01:00:03.463
Hurry up and order.

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:07.164
Excuse me. Thank you.

01:00:08.637 --> 01:00:11.003
How about a smoothie?
What's in that?

01:00:11.239 --> 01:00:13.707
Smoothie's a juice drink.
We want coffee.

01:00:13.775 --> 01:00:14.799
Buddy, relax.

01:00:14.876 --> 01:00:15.865
No, you relax.

01:00:15.944 --> 01:00:17.969
I'm a regular here.
This line needs to move.

01:00:18.046 --> 01:00:19.638
I beg your pardon.

01:00:19.715 --> 01:00:21.307
Do you have scones?

01:00:21.383 --> 01:00:22.907
Tall, non fat,
double latte...

01:00:22.985 --> 01:00:24.475
Sir, you're at
the back of the line.

01:00:24.553 --> 01:00:25.542
I recognize that!

01:00:25.621 --> 01:00:26.952
Cut it out or
you're out of here.

01:00:27.022 --> 01:00:27.954
You can't
kick me out!

01:00:28.023 --> 01:00:30.048
You know, you're... you're
really invading my ear space.

01:00:30.125 --> 01:00:31.387
I'm a frequent
coffee drinker.

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:33.018
I'm part of the club.
I have a card.

01:00:33.095 --> 01:00:34.722
Do you have a card?
Do you have a card?

01:00:34.796 --> 01:00:35.956
No, I don't
have a card.

01:00:36.031 --> 01:00:37.191
Does anyone here
have a card?

01:00:37.265 --> 01:00:38.789
We don't have
frequent drinker cards.

01:00:38.867 --> 01:00:40.266
That's a video club card.

01:00:40.335 --> 01:00:41.495
Zip it there,
Sporty Spice.

01:00:41.603 --> 01:00:43.628
Are we doing this?
Is this happening now?

01:00:43.705 --> 01:00:44.797
Yeah. Wanna go?

01:00:44.873 --> 01:00:46.033
Great.
I'd love to.

01:00:46.108 --> 01:00:47.700
Let's do it. Come on.

01:00:47.776 --> 01:00:50.267
You're hurting me!
You're hurting me!

01:00:50.379 --> 01:00:52.040
What is wrong
with you, Derrick?

01:00:52.114 --> 01:00:53.240
I thought
we were friends!

01:00:53.315 --> 01:00:54.407
My name is Andy!

01:00:54.483 --> 01:00:56.917
Your name is Liar,
'cause you're telling lies.

01:00:56.985 --> 01:00:58.213
You know what the odds are

01:00:58.353 --> 01:00:59.820
I will never come
back here again?

01:00:59.888 --> 01:01:01.116
There's a good
chance of that!

01:01:01.189 --> 01:01:02.622
That's a chance
we'll have to take.

01:01:02.691 --> 01:01:04.352
Okay, if that's how
you want to play it.

01:01:04.426 --> 01:01:06.223
Okay.
I am disappointed!

01:01:06.294 --> 01:01:07.556
Good.

01:01:09.197 --> 01:01:11.062
Get the door! Get the...

01:01:14.936 --> 01:01:16.062
Fine!

01:01:17.806 --> 01:01:20.104
Tigers, bring it in.
Let's go.

01:01:20.609 --> 01:01:21.598
Let's go, guys.

01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:33.110
All right, Tigers.

01:01:34.222 --> 01:01:35.553
Let's get ready
to play, huh?

01:01:35.624 --> 01:01:37.922
I don't wanna see
any laziness there, okay?

01:01:37.993 --> 01:01:39.756
We win this,
we're in the finals.

01:01:39.828 --> 01:01:42.490
If we get a big lead,
we gotta pummel these guys.

01:01:42.564 --> 01:01:44.395
We gotta pummel them
at all costs.

01:01:44.533 --> 01:01:46.364
Dominate and hammer them.

01:01:46.501 --> 01:01:47.934
I want you to play dirty,

01:01:48.003 --> 01:01:50.164
if you have to,
but don't get caught.

01:01:50.238 --> 01:01:52.832
Byong Sun, stay low, okay?

01:01:52.908 --> 01:01:54.535
That's easy for you.

01:01:54.609 --> 01:01:56.543
Just chop block them
in the back of the knee.

01:01:56.611 --> 01:01:57.805
That'll work well.

01:01:57.879 --> 01:01:59.141
Ambrose, you're big.

01:01:59.281 --> 01:02:00.805
Don't be afraid
to throw the elbow.

01:02:00.882 --> 01:02:02.281
If you break
someone's collarbone,

01:02:02.350 --> 01:02:04.545
that's a good thing.
That's what the medic's for.

01:02:04.619 --> 01:02:07.053
Otherwise, he's just
sitting around, all right?

01:02:07.122 --> 01:02:08.214
You hear me?

01:02:08.290 --> 01:02:09.587
Hey, Phil.

01:02:09.758 --> 01:02:11.851
I... I... I don't think that's
a very good attitude.

01:02:11.927 --> 01:02:13.952
You can't talk about
hurting other players.

01:02:14.963 --> 01:02:16.828
You don't think?

01:02:17.199 --> 01:02:18.826
You don't... you don't think?

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.561
I don't think you
should be butting in

01:02:20.635 --> 01:02:22.068
when I'm talking
to my team.

01:02:22.137 --> 01:02:23.764
You're my assistant, okay?

01:02:23.839 --> 01:02:25.397
You're supposed to
back me up

01:02:25.474 --> 01:02:27.271
and go get me juice boxes
when I tell you.

01:02:27.342 --> 01:02:28.741
Now go get me
a juice box.

01:02:28.810 --> 01:02:30.300
You know who
you're talking to?

01:02:30.378 --> 01:02:31.709
I'm talking to
the juice box guy.

01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:32.906
You're crazy!

01:02:32.981 --> 01:02:34.573
I'm not crazy.
I'm just thirsty.

01:02:34.649 --> 01:02:35.911
Why don't you
go to hell?

01:02:35.984 --> 01:02:37.918
No, you go to hell!
While you're there,

01:02:37.986 --> 01:02:39.920
why don't you
grab me a juice box!

01:02:39.988 --> 01:02:41.888
I'm no juice box boy,
I'll tell you that!

01:02:41.957 --> 01:02:43.322
Yes, you are!
No, I'm not!

01:02:43.391 --> 01:02:44.585
Yes, you are!
No, I'm not!

01:02:44.659 --> 01:02:45.921
Yes, you are!
No, I'm not!

01:02:45.994 --> 01:02:47.018
You're like your old man!

01:02:47.095 --> 01:02:48.084
I'm not like
my old man!

01:02:48.163 --> 01:02:50.222
If it weren't for these kids
I would whip your butt!

01:02:50.298 --> 01:02:51.265
I can take a punch!

01:02:51.333 --> 01:02:52.493
I'm out of here.
Bye-bye.

01:02:52.567 --> 01:02:53.795
I'll see you,

01:02:53.902 --> 01:02:55.733
Mr. Big Time Coach.
Bye-bye!

01:02:55.804 --> 01:02:57.863
I'm not like my old man!
I'm a kind and gentle,

01:02:57.939 --> 01:02:59.873
compassionate human being,

01:03:00.142 --> 01:03:02.337
with a heart
as big as a lion!

01:03:03.044 --> 01:03:04.875
We'll see you later,
juice box!

01:03:04.946 --> 01:03:06.914
Everyone wave goodbye
to juice box.

01:03:07.516 --> 01:03:09.575
Literally wave. Do it!

01:03:09.718 --> 01:03:11.515
Parents, too!
Everyone waves!

01:03:13.922 --> 01:03:16.152
Okay. Guys...

01:03:17.592 --> 01:03:19.526
I only want
winners out on the field.

01:03:19.594 --> 01:03:21.027
Who's a winner?

01:03:21.463 --> 01:03:22.862
I said, "Who's a winner?"

01:03:22.931 --> 01:03:23.989
I am.

01:03:24.065 --> 01:03:25.259
Everyone's
hands should be up.

01:03:25.333 --> 01:03:26.265
I am.

01:03:26.334 --> 01:03:27.631
Okay.
Everyone bring it in.

01:03:28.203 --> 01:03:29.170
Who are we?

01:03:29.304 --> 01:03:30.293
Tigers.

01:03:30.405 --> 01:03:31.497
What?

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:32.732
Tigers.

01:03:32.808 --> 01:03:35.299
All right. Let's break
someone's clavicle. On three!

01:03:35.377 --> 01:03:38.403
One, two, three.
Break someone's clavicle!

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:39.913
Hit the field. Let's go.

01:03:39.981 --> 01:03:41.448
Your dad's a trip,
you know that?

01:03:41.516 --> 01:03:42.949
Move it! Move it!

01:03:44.052 --> 01:03:45.041
Huh.

01:03:45.554 --> 01:03:47.021
Pick up that
piece of trash, Tom.

01:03:47.088 --> 01:03:48.521
Tuck in your shirt!

01:03:48.824 --> 01:03:51.292
What are you doing?
Have a sense of pride, huh?

01:03:51.593 --> 01:03:53.720
In fact,
why don't you take a lap?

01:03:54.029 --> 01:03:56.589
Go and run a lap!
I'm timing you.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:03:59.897
Pick it up!

01:04:04.005 --> 01:04:05.199
Faster!

01:04:05.273 --> 01:04:08.436
Here we go! <i>Bellissimo!</i>

01:04:08.610 --> 01:04:10.077
Whoa!

01:04:10.145 --> 01:04:11.510
Let's go!

01:04:12.047 --> 01:04:13.309
Over here, Son. Hunter!

01:04:13.381 --> 01:04:14.814
He's right there.
He's right there.

01:04:14.883 --> 01:04:15.781
Good. Good.

01:04:32.868 --> 01:04:35.928
Yes! Hey, you just were served
a plate of humiliation.

01:04:36.004 --> 01:04:37.130
How does that feel?

01:04:37.205 --> 01:04:38.570
Hey! Off the field.

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.608
Off the field, Tarzan.

01:04:44.212 --> 01:04:45.577
I'm off.

01:04:58.159 --> 01:05:00.024
Defense! Come on!

01:05:00.161 --> 01:05:02.152
You guys know
anything about defense?

01:05:04.499 --> 01:05:05.488
Dad?
Yeah?

01:05:05.567 --> 01:05:07.034
Dad? Dad?

01:05:07.102 --> 01:05:08.126
Not now, Sam.

01:05:08.203 --> 01:05:09.329
Can you put me in?

01:05:09.404 --> 01:05:11.531
Later. Later.
Go grab some bench.

01:05:11.606 --> 01:05:14.336
Come on!
There we go, Gian Piero.

01:05:15.977 --> 01:05:17.672
You look good.

01:05:22.183 --> 01:05:23.343
Think you can mark him?

01:05:23.418 --> 01:05:24.544
Yeah, I could take him.

01:05:24.619 --> 01:05:27.452
J.J., Zack, everybody see what
we got to do with these guys?

01:05:27.522 --> 01:05:29.513
Four on one,
three on another, right?

01:05:29.591 --> 01:05:31.525
We have to... We really have
to smother them.

01:05:32.627 --> 01:05:33.719
Stop them.

01:05:36.564 --> 01:05:37.690
Yeah!
Yes!

01:05:37.766 --> 01:05:40.257
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:05:40.602 --> 01:05:42.433
Yeah! All right!

01:05:45.807 --> 01:05:47.240
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:05:47.309 --> 01:05:49.004
Did you just push
a kid to the ground?

01:05:49.077 --> 01:05:51.375
He fell down!
He fell down!

01:05:51.546 --> 01:05:53.377
Play it up. Play it up.

01:05:53.615 --> 01:05:54.604
Play it up.

01:05:54.749 --> 01:05:56.649
Back and forth!

01:06:03.892 --> 01:06:06.156
Victory! We're in the finals!

01:06:06.628 --> 01:06:09.529
We're in the finals!
All right!

01:06:10.265 --> 01:06:13.530
Losers! Losers!

01:06:13.802 --> 01:06:16.635
Losers.
You're a loser! Loser!

01:06:16.705 --> 01:06:18.332
We won, Byong Sun!

01:06:18.473 --> 01:06:20.100
No. Phil!

01:06:21.343 --> 01:06:22.275
Stop it!

01:06:22.344 --> 01:06:23.675
Everyone should
get one of these.

01:06:23.745 --> 01:06:24.803
Pass him around.

01:06:24.879 --> 01:06:26.278
All right. I got him.

01:06:26.348 --> 01:06:27.679
Pass him around!

01:06:29.718 --> 01:06:30.844
Honey!

01:06:31.753 --> 01:06:34.347
Okay. All right.
That's it. I got this.

01:06:34.422 --> 01:06:36.617
Hold him down. Phil!

01:06:36.691 --> 01:06:37.919
Get the rope!

01:06:38.026 --> 01:06:40.017
What in the world
happened to your dad?

01:06:40.095 --> 01:06:42.290
I don't know.
But I'll tell you one thing.

01:06:42.797 --> 01:06:45.288
I'm never drinking
coffee as long as I live.

01:06:49.571 --> 01:06:50.697
Wow!

01:06:51.039 --> 01:06:53.371
Wow! Wow! Wow!
Wow! Wow!

01:06:53.775 --> 01:06:55.037
What a day!

01:06:56.144 --> 01:06:57.839
Wh-What is with the coffee?

01:06:58.046 --> 01:07:00.606
Every home in Europe has
its own coffee press.

01:07:00.682 --> 01:07:02.047
In fact, every room.

01:07:02.884 --> 01:07:03.976
Okay,
you know what, Phil?

01:07:04.052 --> 01:07:06.077
You gotta stop.
You've gone overboard.

01:07:06.354 --> 01:07:07.548
What are you talking about?

01:07:07.622 --> 01:07:10.250
You called a group of
10-year-olds "losers. "

01:07:10.425 --> 01:07:11.483
I did not.

01:07:11.559 --> 01:07:12.787
You screamed it
through a cone.

01:07:12.861 --> 01:07:13.850
Everyone heard you.

01:07:13.928 --> 01:07:16.055
What do you want me
to call them? Winners?

01:07:16.131 --> 01:07:18.099
'Cause that would
make me a liar, okay?

01:07:18.166 --> 01:07:20.100
And at least, give me that.
I am not a liar.

01:07:20.168 --> 01:07:21.465
You just lied, just a...
When?

01:07:21.536 --> 01:07:22.696
Just a second ago!
When?

01:07:22.771 --> 01:07:24.295
About the cone thing!

01:07:24.839 --> 01:07:26.397
Okay, you got me
on that one.

01:07:26.474 --> 01:07:27.998
That's one lie,
though.

01:07:28.209 --> 01:07:29.369
We're in the finals.

01:07:29.444 --> 01:07:31.412
Am I the only one
who cares about that?

01:07:31.579 --> 01:07:32.773
Where's Sam?

01:07:32.914 --> 01:07:34.541
Well, Sam's up in his room.

01:07:34.616 --> 01:07:36.277
Very upset. Very depressed.

01:07:36.418 --> 01:07:38.079
Depressed? We won.

01:07:38.186 --> 01:07:39.653
You didn't play him,
Phil.

01:07:39.721 --> 01:07:42.986
I warned you about, this has
become all about you and Buck.

01:07:43.058 --> 01:07:44.184
That is patently untrue.

01:07:44.259 --> 01:07:46.693
And as far as Sam not playing
in the game, that's his fault.

01:07:46.795 --> 01:07:47.727
What?

01:07:47.796 --> 01:07:50.230
He needs to speak up, okay? I
can't worry about every player.

01:07:50.298 --> 01:07:52.289
I can't talk to you
about this. No, not anymore.

01:07:52.367 --> 01:07:53.800
I don't even
know who you are.

01:07:53.902 --> 01:07:55.301
You're not human,
that's for sure.

01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:56.860
You're like some
kind of animal.

01:07:56.938 --> 01:07:57.962
An animal?

01:07:58.039 --> 01:07:59.472
Yes, like a wild animal.

01:07:59.574 --> 01:08:00.598
Where are you going?

01:08:00.675 --> 01:08:01.642
I'm going.

01:08:03.178 --> 01:08:04.975
Coffee will make
you feel better.

01:08:22.096 --> 01:08:24.156
Barbara, are you
there? Pick up. It's me.

01:08:24.232 --> 01:08:25.563
Game's about to start.

01:08:25.633 --> 01:08:28.067
Where's Sammy? I thought
you guys were gonna meet me here.

01:08:28.169 --> 01:08:29.430
Hello? Hello?

01:08:30.738 --> 01:08:32.671
You know what,
I gotta run.

01:08:33.774 --> 01:08:35.765
What are you?
Who dresses you these days?

01:08:35.844 --> 01:08:37.778
What's this,
some kind of clown outfit?

01:08:37.845 --> 01:08:40.178
No.
It's a Tiger outfit.

01:08:40.448 --> 01:08:41.745
Good. Good.

01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:43.879
Some of the cool stuff
I can do.

01:08:44.018 --> 01:08:46.111
And you think this
suit's gonna help you?

01:08:47.455 --> 01:08:50.652
We'll see.
Might be a good luck charm.

01:08:52.426 --> 01:08:54.361
Okay, good luck, Son.
You're gonna need it.

01:09:03.138 --> 01:09:06.403
Bring it in. Let's go.
Huddle it up. Come on.

01:09:06.474 --> 01:09:07.839
Coach, um, where's Sam?

01:09:07.908 --> 01:09:09.274
Because I don't
see him anywhere.

01:09:09.344 --> 01:09:11.140
He'll be here.
Don't worry about it. Okay.

01:09:11.212 --> 01:09:13.145
Guys, listen up.

01:09:15.216 --> 01:09:18.515
Now I don't think it needs
to be said more than once

01:09:18.752 --> 01:09:20.653
how important
today's game is, huh?

01:09:20.721 --> 01:09:22.814
This is what
we've worked all year for.

01:09:22.890 --> 01:09:24.415
Why are you whispering?

01:09:24.559 --> 01:09:26.082
For dramatic effect!

01:09:26.895 --> 01:09:28.362
Who are those
guys over there, huh?

01:09:28.429 --> 01:09:29.520
Tigers.

01:09:29.596 --> 01:09:30.859
They look like
pussycats to me.

01:09:30.932 --> 01:09:32.194
What do you say?
Yeah.

01:09:32.267 --> 01:09:33.256
Afraid of 'em?

01:09:33.334 --> 01:09:34.323
No!

01:09:34.402 --> 01:09:35.334
Okay.

01:09:35.403 --> 01:09:37.462
You step on this field,
this is all about you.

01:09:37.538 --> 01:09:40.406
I mean, I'm not gonna be
the one staying up late at night,

01:09:40.475 --> 01:09:43.000
you know, punching a hole
through the window

01:09:43.077 --> 01:09:46.136
or crying myself to sleep
or wetting my bed.

01:09:47.448 --> 01:09:49.416
Okay? That's not gonna be me.

01:09:49.484 --> 01:09:50.644
'Cause I'm fine.

01:09:50.718 --> 01:09:52.412
I got my vitamin store
to go back to.

01:09:52.487 --> 01:09:54.580
I'm gonna be just great.
I'm gonna be great.

01:09:54.656 --> 01:09:56.385
Let me hear you say
that we can do this.

01:09:56.457 --> 01:09:57.446
We can do this!

01:09:57.525 --> 01:09:58.685
Again.
We can do this!

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:00.921
One more time.
We can do this!

01:10:01.029 --> 01:10:02.519
You either win

01:10:02.597 --> 01:10:05.293
and go on to greatness,
or you lose.

01:10:06.234 --> 01:10:09.294
And probably face a series of
cataclysmic events

01:10:09.370 --> 01:10:10.837
for the rest of your lives.

01:10:11.806 --> 01:10:13.296
Bring it in, guys.

01:10:13.374 --> 01:10:14.398
Bring it in.

01:10:14.475 --> 01:10:16.739
Tigers on three. Whisper.

01:10:17.045 --> 01:10:18.706
One, two, three.

01:10:18.846 --> 01:10:20.507
Tigers.

01:10:20.615 --> 01:10:22.776
One, two, three, Gladiators!

01:10:22.984 --> 01:10:25.179
<i> Good afternoon,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:10:25.253 --> 01:10:28.347
<i>and welcome to the HHSO</i>
<i>Championship game. </i>

01:10:28.423 --> 01:10:30.015
<i>I'll be giving</i>
<i>you a play-by-play,</i>

01:10:30.091 --> 01:10:31.718
<i>blow-by-blow of</i>
<i>what promises to be</i>

01:10:31.826 --> 01:10:32.918
<i>the game of the year. </i>

01:10:32.994 --> 01:10:34.359
Look alive!

01:10:34.495 --> 01:10:36.486
<i>Tigers versus the Gladiators. </i>

01:10:36.831 --> 01:10:38.560
<i>Gladiators with the ball. </i>

01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:40.167
<i>Immediately</i>
<i>stolen by Massimo!</i>

01:10:40.235 --> 01:10:41.395
Go!

01:10:41.536 --> 01:10:43.766
Defense!
Push deeper! Deep! Deep!

01:10:43.838 --> 01:10:46.830
<i>He kicks it high. </i>
<i>It's a perfect pass!</i>

01:10:46.908 --> 01:10:48.569
<i>Shot! Goal!</i>

01:10:48.643 --> 01:10:49.769
Yeah!

01:10:56.150 --> 01:10:57.640
Are you ready for this?

01:10:58.386 --> 01:11:01.321
<i>The Gladiators with</i>
<i>some good ball movement. </i>

01:11:01.556 --> 01:11:04.150
<i>Shot! It's off the mark. </i>

01:11:04.392 --> 01:11:06.053
Give it up, Dad!

01:11:06.127 --> 01:11:08.027
It's a long game, sonny!

01:11:08.663 --> 01:11:11.996
Hey, grab the pebble
from my hand, Grasshopper!

01:11:12.267 --> 01:11:13.461
What?

01:11:14.035 --> 01:11:16.162
Hey!
If it isn't fart-face Jones.

01:11:16.771 --> 01:11:18.398
What's up,
farty pants?

01:11:18.606 --> 01:11:20.198
Bring it on.

01:11:20.341 --> 01:11:22.206
You can have
the first punch right here.

01:11:22.810 --> 01:11:25.370
I could eat a box of cookies
for dinner if I want to.

01:11:25.446 --> 01:11:26.708
What? Can you do that? No.

01:11:26.781 --> 01:11:28.248
'Cause you're
a fart-face kid.

01:11:28.316 --> 01:11:31.308
Oh, my God! No! Tigers!
Help me! Get him off me!

01:11:32.587 --> 01:11:34.077
Get him, Logan.
Attaboy, Logan.

01:11:34.155 --> 01:11:35.315
Ow! He's got my ear.

01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:37.290
He's got my ear!

01:11:40.228 --> 01:11:42.389
He's like a jackal from hell!

01:11:44.098 --> 01:11:46.464
<i>Italians with the ball. </i>

01:11:46.601 --> 01:11:49.001
<i>And they pass it of</i>
<i>to little Byong Sun!</i>

01:11:49.103 --> 01:11:50.866
Pass it off! Pass it!

01:11:50.938 --> 01:11:53.236
Do it! Shoot it,
Byong Sun. Shoot it!

01:11:53.308 --> 01:11:54.275
No! No, no.

01:11:55.443 --> 01:11:56.774
<i>Oh! Weak kick!</i>

01:11:56.844 --> 01:11:59.745
<i>Stolen away and</i>
<i>kicked way downfield. </i>

01:12:00.682 --> 01:12:02.445
<i>Gladiators moving the ball. </i>

01:12:02.517 --> 01:12:04.246
Hunter, catch up!
Catch up.

01:12:04.319 --> 01:12:06.617
<i>They find Bucky Weston</i>
<i>in the open. </i>

01:12:06.688 --> 01:12:08.349
<i>He shoots! Score!</i>

01:12:08.423 --> 01:12:09.447
Yes!

01:12:09.524 --> 01:12:10.786
<i>Gladiators tie the game. </i>

01:12:10.858 --> 01:12:12.485
Byong Sun!

01:12:13.995 --> 01:12:15.462
What was that?

01:12:15.596 --> 01:12:17.086
I thought
I had the shot.

01:12:17.165 --> 01:12:18.154
You thought?

01:12:18.232 --> 01:12:19.824
How many times do
I have to say this?

01:12:19.901 --> 01:12:22.961
You can take as many shots
as you want during practice.

01:12:23.204 --> 01:12:25.104
But never ever
in a game.

01:12:25.173 --> 01:12:27.004
Especially not
the championship game.

01:12:27.075 --> 01:12:28.406
Okay,
you cannot talk to him...

01:12:28.476 --> 01:12:29.704
No, no, no.
Don't go there.

01:12:29.777 --> 01:12:31.608
Take a seat.
Go ahead.

01:12:32.013 --> 01:12:33.344
Ease up on him!

01:12:33.648 --> 01:12:36.344
You ease up on that
corduroy jacket of yours.

01:12:38.186 --> 01:12:40.120
<i>Gladiators moving the ball. </i>

01:12:42.357 --> 01:12:44.450
<i>Oh! Number 14 goes down. </i>

01:12:44.525 --> 01:12:46.220
Come on! That?

01:12:46.294 --> 01:12:47.420
Good call, ref!

01:12:47.495 --> 01:12:48.462
That's a bad call!

01:12:48.529 --> 01:12:49.621
All right, coaches!

01:12:50.164 --> 01:12:51.791
Coaches here, now!

01:12:53.368 --> 01:12:55.097
God! That's a bad call,
you know it!

01:12:55.169 --> 01:12:56.136
Hey, hey, hey.

01:12:56.204 --> 01:12:57.193
That's a bad call!

01:12:57.271 --> 01:12:58.329
Hey! Hey,
I'm warning you.

01:12:58.406 --> 01:12:59.395
Let me ask you a question.

01:12:59.474 --> 01:13:00.463
Let me ask a question.

01:13:00.541 --> 01:13:02.338
How much you pay him
to make those calls?

01:13:02.410 --> 01:13:04.173
You are one wisecrack away

01:13:04.245 --> 01:13:05.678
from being thrown
out of this game.

01:13:05.747 --> 01:13:06.975
I don't want to
get thrown out.

01:13:07.048 --> 01:13:09.141
Can't a guy just be
enthusiastic about the game?

01:13:09.217 --> 01:13:10.377
You can be
enthusiastic...

01:13:10.451 --> 01:13:11.440
That's all I want to do.

01:13:11.519 --> 01:13:12.611
...at a respectable level.

01:13:12.687 --> 01:13:13.813
I just wanna have fun.

01:13:14.922 --> 01:13:16.651
Now, go to
your places!

01:13:16.791 --> 01:13:18.554
And keep your
comments to yourself.

01:13:20.795 --> 01:13:22.228
Wow! What was
that all about?

01:13:22.363 --> 01:13:23.796
Here's all I heard.

01:13:23.865 --> 01:13:24.797
The ref said...

01:13:25.867 --> 01:13:26.856
Then my Dad said...

01:13:28.136 --> 01:13:29.330
Then the ref said...

01:13:30.471 --> 01:13:31.961
Any more questions?

01:13:32.073 --> 01:13:34.132
Hit the road. Move it.

01:13:38.112 --> 01:13:39.636
<i>Massimo with the ball,</i>

01:13:39.714 --> 01:13:41.705
<i>trying to pass it</i>
<i>off to his brother. </i>

01:13:41.883 --> 01:13:43.407
Come on!

01:13:43.885 --> 01:13:46.217
<i>But Buck Weston has figured out</i>
<i>this Tiger offense. </i>

01:13:46.287 --> 01:13:47.219
Go!

01:13:48.856 --> 01:13:50.517
Get back on defense!

01:13:52.026 --> 01:13:53.288
What did I just say?

01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:58.490
<i>Bucky with another open shot. </i>
<i>Goal!</i>

01:13:58.566 --> 01:13:59.692
Yes!

01:13:59.767 --> 01:14:01.826
<i>Gladiators take the lead. </i>

01:14:02.036 --> 01:14:03.003
Was anyone listening?

01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:04.628
<i>The Italians have effectively</i>
<i>been shut down. </i>

01:14:04.739 --> 01:14:06.070
Great.

01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:06.629
That's my boy!

01:14:08.609 --> 01:14:09.769
That's the half.

01:14:14.482 --> 01:14:16.177
Honey, wh-where have you been?

01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:17.683
I called you twice.

01:14:17.919 --> 01:14:20.285
What? Why isn't Sam
in his uniform?

01:14:20.354 --> 01:14:21.343
So, how's it going?

01:14:21.422 --> 01:14:23.447
It took me all morning
to convince him to come.

01:14:23.524 --> 01:14:25.992
And the only reason he is here
is to support his team.

01:14:26.127 --> 01:14:27.651
What, he doesn't
want to play for me?

01:14:27.728 --> 01:14:29.218
He would love to
play for you

01:14:29.297 --> 01:14:31.288
but you've turned
him into a benchwarmer.

01:14:31.365 --> 01:14:32.764
Sound familiar?

01:14:33.434 --> 01:14:34.958
Look, I just wanted

01:14:35.036 --> 01:14:37.504
to get to
the championship game, that...

01:14:38.539 --> 01:14:40.336
Well, you're here, Phil.

01:14:44.579 --> 01:14:46.979
I'm not crying.
It's frustration.

01:14:47.548 --> 01:14:50.711
Don't worry. You'll
be all right. Gonna be all right.

01:14:50.785 --> 01:14:53.777
If you play the second half the
way you played the first half,

01:14:53.855 --> 01:14:56.346
I'm gonna trade the whole team
to the Tigers next year.

01:14:56.424 --> 01:14:59.086
Can I go in now?
I have fresh legs.

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:00.354
<i>Philly, I can't. </i>

01:15:00.428 --> 01:15:02.020
<i>It's the championship game,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

01:15:02.096 --> 01:15:03.324
Don't bother me, okay?

01:15:03.397 --> 01:15:05.058
I didn't play
the week before, either.

01:15:05.132 --> 01:15:07.692
I promise you, I'll
play you next season, okay?

01:15:07.768 --> 01:15:08.894
You want to be Gladiators?

01:15:08.970 --> 01:15:09.902
Yeah!

01:15:09.971 --> 01:15:11.233
Let's say,
"We are Gladiators. "

01:15:11.305 --> 01:15:12.294
We are Gladiators!

01:15:12.373 --> 01:15:14.170
Say it again!
We are Gladiators!

01:15:14.242 --> 01:15:17.541
Okay, go out in the second
half, I want you to stay focused.

01:15:18.613 --> 01:15:21.707
You doing okay?
I know this is tough.

01:15:22.783 --> 01:15:24.216
Hey, guys.

01:15:25.353 --> 01:15:27.048
Sam, you think
I could talk to you?

01:15:27.488 --> 01:15:28.750
I guess.

01:15:29.156 --> 01:15:30.714
Honey, do you mind?

01:15:30.858 --> 01:15:32.450
Sure.

01:15:36.597 --> 01:15:39.065
So, I just
was thinking, uh...

01:15:40.668 --> 01:15:42.431
You know, grown-ups
are always telling kids

01:15:42.503 --> 01:15:44.266
how they mess up, right?

01:15:44.839 --> 01:15:46.397
But the truth is

01:15:46.841 --> 01:15:48.308
sometimes
grown-ups screw up

01:15:48.376 --> 01:15:51.573
but we don't have anyone to
tell us when we do it.

01:15:52.747 --> 01:15:54.009
I screwed up, Sam.

01:15:54.081 --> 01:15:55.207
You think?

01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:59.615
I just got caught up
in everything.

01:16:00.354 --> 01:16:02.914
I really lost my way,
I mean,

01:16:05.927 --> 01:16:07.690
I apologize.

01:16:08.596 --> 01:16:10.325
I just wanna ask
you if you... if you can

01:16:10.398 --> 01:16:12.161
find it in your heart
to forgive me

01:16:12.967 --> 01:16:14.264
and you give me
a second chance,

01:16:14.335 --> 01:16:15.825
I'd like to
make it up to you.

01:16:18.639 --> 01:16:20.300
Okay.

01:16:20.641 --> 01:16:21.869
You accept
my apology then?

01:16:22.009 --> 01:16:23.271
Yeah.

01:16:24.946 --> 01:16:26.538
Thanks, buddy.

01:16:26.614 --> 01:16:28.673
All right. You're
starting the second half.

01:16:29.317 --> 01:16:30.443
Really?

01:16:30.518 --> 01:16:31.712
Yeah.

01:16:32.119 --> 01:16:33.950
You're not worried
about losing the game?

01:16:34.021 --> 01:16:35.886
No, I'm worried
about losing you.

01:16:36.123 --> 01:16:38.284
I brought your uniform just in case.

01:16:38.359 --> 01:16:39.326
So, go suit up.

01:16:39.393 --> 01:16:40.360
All right.

01:16:40.428 --> 01:16:41.986
Okay?

01:16:44.465 --> 01:16:45.397
Good job.

01:16:45.533 --> 01:16:46.500
Thanks.

01:16:46.867 --> 01:16:48.357
Now, give me
that jacket.

01:16:48.436 --> 01:16:50.063
Oh.
It's bad?

01:16:50.137 --> 01:16:51.104
Horrible.

01:16:51.172 --> 01:16:52.139
Okay.

01:16:52.206 --> 01:16:53.195
Hey, guys.

01:16:53.274 --> 01:16:55.333
Everyone take a seat,
if you would.

01:16:56.010 --> 01:16:58.535
I have something important
I'd like to tell you. Um...

01:17:01.248 --> 01:17:04.479
I just want you guys to know
that I know that I blew it.

01:17:04.986 --> 01:17:07.614
I... I... I... I completely blew it.

01:17:09.323 --> 01:17:12.053
And we should've just been
having fun all along

01:17:12.126 --> 01:17:14.287
and honestly,
I don't know what happened.

01:17:14.562 --> 01:17:17.497
And I owe you,
I owe all of you an apology.

01:17:17.999 --> 01:17:20.832
I am very, very,

01:17:21.802 --> 01:17:25.568
very, very sorry.

01:17:26.674 --> 01:17:29.802
With a capital "S"
and a capital "ORRY."

01:17:31.045 --> 01:17:32.273
You know what I mean.

01:17:33.047 --> 01:17:35.572
You... You guys are great kids.
You're unique

01:17:35.650 --> 01:17:37.811
with... with... with your own
strengths and talents,

01:17:37.885 --> 01:17:39.819
and I should've
been promoting that.

01:17:40.254 --> 01:17:42.745
Instead, I wasn't,
'cause I'm a lousy coach

01:17:42.823 --> 01:17:44.290
and I didn't
teach you anything.

01:17:44.358 --> 01:17:45.620
That's not true,
Dad.

01:17:45.693 --> 01:17:47.388
What? What are you talking about?

01:17:47.461 --> 01:17:48.587
He's a lousy coach.

01:17:48.663 --> 01:17:49.789
He didn't teach me anything.

01:17:49.864 --> 01:17:51.161
He tried to kill me.

01:17:51.232 --> 01:17:53.826
He taught us exactly how
not to play soccer.

01:17:55.469 --> 01:17:57.096
Actually, Sam's right.

01:17:57.238 --> 01:17:58.899
That's exactly what I did.

01:18:00.274 --> 01:18:01.866
We just need to
take the field

01:18:01.942 --> 01:18:03.534
and you guys
just do e-e-exactly

01:18:03.611 --> 01:18:05.841
the opposite of
everything I've taught you.

01:18:05.913 --> 01:18:07.073
Does that make sense?

01:18:07.148 --> 01:18:08.945
What have I... What have I
told you to do?

01:18:09.016 --> 01:18:10.643
Always play the Italians.

01:18:10.718 --> 01:18:12.447
Okay. There you go.

01:18:12.553 --> 01:18:13.679
Gian Piero, Massimo,

01:18:13.754 --> 01:18:15.221
we'll get some
fresh legs in there.

01:18:15.289 --> 01:18:16.415
Give you guys a rest?

01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:17.650
Rest?
Yeah.

01:18:17.725 --> 01:18:19.215
Okay <i>. Grazie. </i>

01:18:19.293 --> 01:18:20.282
Thanks.

01:18:20.361 --> 01:18:21.589
Wh-What else
have I taught you?

01:18:21.662 --> 01:18:23.391
Break people's clavicles.

01:18:23.464 --> 01:18:24.522
Chop block.

01:18:24.665 --> 01:18:26.257
Tattoos are cool!

01:18:26.434 --> 01:18:27.867
Don't remember that one.

01:18:27.935 --> 01:18:29.197
Coffee is the lifeblood

01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:31.067
that fuels
the dreams of champions.

01:18:31.672 --> 01:18:33.003
Right. Hold on.

01:18:40.081 --> 01:18:41.446
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:18:44.652 --> 01:18:46.552
Way to go, Byong Sun!

01:18:52.426 --> 01:18:54.326
All right. What else?

01:18:54.695 --> 01:18:56.890
The most important
thing is winning.

01:18:57.198 --> 01:18:59.598
No. No, no, no, no.
The most important thing

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:02.863
is... is having fun and
trying your best, all right?

01:19:03.237 --> 01:19:05.637
So, let's get out there
and do everything

01:19:05.706 --> 01:19:07.765
the opposite of
what I've taught you.

01:19:07.975 --> 01:19:09.272
Sound like a plan?

01:19:10.845 --> 01:19:12.574
Bring it in. Here we go.

01:19:12.646 --> 01:19:13.806
Yes.

01:19:14.915 --> 01:19:16.382
What are we gonna do?

01:19:16.450 --> 01:19:17.974
Don't listen to Phil!

01:19:18.152 --> 01:19:21.644
Take the field.
Here we go, guys. Have fun!

01:19:22.656 --> 01:19:24.590
<i> Down by one,</i>
<i>the Tigers have both Italians</i>

01:19:24.658 --> 01:19:26.057
<i>sitting on the bench?</i>

01:19:26.127 --> 01:19:28.061
<i>Odd move by</i>
<i>Coach Phil Weston. </i>

01:19:29.196 --> 01:19:30.493
Stop them, guys!

01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:35.635
<i>Goal, and the Tiger</i>
<i>goalie goes down hard!</i>

01:19:35.736 --> 01:19:36.794
Oh, my...

01:19:36.871 --> 01:19:37.838
That's it.

01:19:37.905 --> 01:19:40.271
That's the intensity I've
been looking for. That's it.

01:19:42.343 --> 01:19:44.174
<i>The Tiger goalie looks okay. </i>

01:19:44.245 --> 01:19:45.769
Hey, ref? Injury?
Time out?

01:19:45.846 --> 01:19:47.313
<i>Coach Weston is</i>
<i>taking no chances. </i>

01:19:47.381 --> 01:19:48.712
Time out.
Everyone with glasses.

01:19:48.849 --> 01:19:50.214
Can I borrow your glasses?

01:19:50.284 --> 01:19:51.649
Would you mind?
Thank you.

01:19:51.786 --> 01:19:53.083
I appreciate that.

01:19:53.154 --> 01:19:54.678
You look like
you need those.

01:19:55.122 --> 01:19:56.646
Thank you.
Appreciate that.

01:19:56.857 --> 01:19:57.915
You all right?

01:19:57.992 --> 01:19:59.016
Yeah, I'm all right.

01:19:59.093 --> 01:20:01.288
Just want to do a little
vision test here. All right?

01:20:01.428 --> 01:20:02.360
Is that better
or worse?

01:20:02.429 --> 01:20:03.396
Worse.

01:20:04.331 --> 01:20:05.355
Better or worse?

01:20:05.432 --> 01:20:06.399
Worse.

01:20:07.334 --> 01:20:08.801
Better or worse?

01:20:09.103 --> 01:20:10.092
Better!

01:20:10.171 --> 01:20:11.604
Okay. Put those on.
Let's go, guys.

01:20:11.672 --> 01:20:13.003
Okay. All right.
Come on.

01:20:13.073 --> 01:20:14.062
Thanks.

01:20:16.010 --> 01:20:17.568
He's okay.

01:20:21.582 --> 01:20:23.140
<i>Play resumes. </i>

01:20:23.217 --> 01:20:25.515
<i>The Gladiators still</i>
<i>dominating the field. </i>

01:20:27.054 --> 01:20:30.080
<i>Wow. An amazing save</i>
<i>by the Tiger goalie!</i>

01:20:30.157 --> 01:20:31.215
Yes!
That's my baby!

01:20:31.292 --> 01:20:32.589
He stopped that goal.

01:20:37.765 --> 01:20:39.130
<i>Tigers with the ball. </i>

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.929
Mark! Mark!

01:20:41.001 --> 01:20:41.990
On the neck!

01:20:42.069 --> 01:20:43.001
Yes!

01:20:43.771 --> 01:20:45.602
<i>Mark Avery kicks the ball up,</i>

01:20:45.673 --> 01:20:47.265
<i>catches it on</i>
<i>the back of his neck. </i>

01:20:47.341 --> 01:20:48.433
Yes.

01:20:48.509 --> 01:20:51.171
<i>The rest of the Tigers are</i>
<i>forming some kind of wedge. </i>

01:20:51.245 --> 01:20:52.769
Break through.
Win the ball back!

01:20:52.847 --> 01:20:54.405
Knock those clowns down.

01:20:56.851 --> 01:20:58.375
<i>Mark Avery leads the league</i>

01:20:58.452 --> 01:21:00.352
<i>in the least amount of</i>
<i>time played. </i>

01:21:01.789 --> 01:21:03.780
Hey, keeper.

01:21:07.461 --> 01:21:08.485
Ew!

01:21:15.035 --> 01:21:16.024
Mmm.

01:21:17.504 --> 01:21:20.371
<i>Ambrose with</i>
<i>a powerhouse kick!</i>

01:21:25.012 --> 01:21:26.775
Yeah!

01:21:29.416 --> 01:21:30.849
Yes!

01:21:30.951 --> 01:21:33.852
Hunter, I'd give you a kiss
but you just ate a worm.

01:21:34.555 --> 01:21:36.147
Yeah! Can you smell it?

01:21:36.223 --> 01:21:37.190
Yeah! All right, Mark!

01:21:37.258 --> 01:21:38.816
It's the smell
of victory, baby!

01:21:38.893 --> 01:21:40.383
I love you, Dad!

01:21:40.661 --> 01:21:42.526
See if you love me
at the end of the game.

01:21:42.596 --> 01:21:44.291
Let's go, guys. Stay focused.

01:21:44.498 --> 01:21:46.625
Every time you say
something back to me,

01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:48.292
it makes me love you more!

01:21:48.602 --> 01:21:50.467
I can't... I can't
believe this.

01:21:54.575 --> 01:21:56.736
<i> Hunter is tearing down</i>
<i>the field!</i>

01:21:58.245 --> 01:21:59.837
<i>And he kicks</i>
<i>the ball to Jack. </i>

01:22:01.982 --> 01:22:03.540
Get over there!
Go, Hunter!

01:22:04.118 --> 01:22:06.313
<i>Jack takes</i>
<i>the ball into the corner. </i>

01:22:09.556 --> 01:22:11.547
<i>Whoa! It's a little bit high. </i>

01:22:12.226 --> 01:22:13.955
<i>Wait a second,</i>
<i>what's going on?</i>

01:22:14.929 --> 01:22:17.762
<i>It's like they're forming</i>
<i>some sort of mega person. </i>

01:22:21.035 --> 01:22:22.627
Did everyone see that?

01:22:25.339 --> 01:22:28.433
<i>A header by Byong Sun from</i>
<i>Ambrose's shoulder for a goal. </i>

01:22:28.509 --> 01:22:30.238
Way to go, Bing Bong!

01:22:30.311 --> 01:22:32.370
That's not legal.
Is that legal, ref?

01:22:32.446 --> 01:22:34.038
Great hustle.
Gian Piero and Massimo.

01:22:34.114 --> 01:22:35.513
You're back in.
Okay.

01:22:35.582 --> 01:22:37.072
But remember,
share the ball.

01:22:37.151 --> 01:22:38.243
Okay.
Team.

01:22:38.319 --> 01:22:40.014
Right? Team.
Yeah. Good. Good, good.

01:22:40.087 --> 01:22:41.645
Okay, guys.

01:22:42.056 --> 01:22:43.683
<i>The Italians are back in. </i>

01:22:43.757 --> 01:22:45.384
<i>And Massimo steals the ball. </i>

01:22:50.864 --> 01:22:52.764
<i>Less than</i>
<i>a minute left to play. </i>

01:22:52.833 --> 01:22:55.529
<i>The Gladiators are</i>
<i>completely out of sync here. </i>

01:22:57.171 --> 01:23:00.800
<i>And the ball goes</i>
<i>to Ambrose who fakes. </i>

01:23:00.874 --> 01:23:03.843
Watch it! It's a trap!
Stay with the Italians!

01:23:03.911 --> 01:23:05.640
Come on, Sam!

01:23:09.249 --> 01:23:12.275
You're gonna have to get
past old, uncle Bucky for this one.

01:23:13.454 --> 01:23:15.718
Here's something
your dad never taught you.

01:23:40.447 --> 01:23:42.210
Goal!

01:23:48.255 --> 01:23:49.950
<i>And you can</i>
<i>put it on the board. </i>

01:23:52.226 --> 01:23:53.488
That's the game!

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:56.495
<i>Tigers win! Tigers win!</i>

01:23:58.365 --> 01:24:00.162
Way to go, guys!

01:24:00.868 --> 01:24:02.529
Nice job, everyone!

01:24:07.007 --> 01:24:08.531
Come on, honey!

01:24:10.444 --> 01:24:12.469
Sammy!

01:24:15.382 --> 01:24:17.350
Where did you learn
to move like that, Sam?

01:24:17.418 --> 01:24:19.477
I practiced every time
you benched me.

01:24:24.058 --> 01:24:25.616
Tigers! Tigers!

01:24:31.598 --> 01:24:32.826
Great game, Bucky.

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:34.231
A hell of a game, bro.

01:24:34.301 --> 01:24:35.700
I guess we really
got out-coached.

01:24:35.769 --> 01:24:36.929
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

01:24:37.004 --> 01:24:37.936
And I'm serious.

01:24:38.005 --> 01:24:39.336
I don't give
compliments lightly.

01:24:39.406 --> 01:24:40.600
This is from the heart.

01:24:40.674 --> 01:24:42.141
I'm not blowing
smoke up my butt.

01:24:42.209 --> 01:24:43.642
I think you mean
smoke up my butt.

01:24:43.710 --> 01:24:45.143
No. Dude,
just take the compliment.

01:24:45.212 --> 01:24:46.577
You got it.

01:24:47.314 --> 01:24:48.474
I'll see you later.

01:24:48.549 --> 01:24:49.675
See you at the barbecue.

01:24:54.354 --> 01:24:55.321
Good job.

01:24:55.389 --> 01:24:56.481
Sorry, Grandpa.

01:24:56.557 --> 01:24:58.286
What, are you kiddin' me?

01:24:58.625 --> 01:25:01.719
If anyone's gonna beat me,
I'm glad it was you.

01:25:01.929 --> 01:25:03.260
Great goal, Samson.

01:25:03.397 --> 01:25:04.728
So, you're not mad?

01:25:04.798 --> 01:25:06.629
The only thing
that makes me mad

01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:09.601
is that I let you get away
from the Gladiators, okay?

01:25:11.505 --> 01:25:13.370
I'll never be mad at you.
Never.

01:25:17.411 --> 01:25:18.878
Burgers look good, right?

01:25:18.946 --> 01:25:20.038
That one's dead.

01:25:20.114 --> 01:25:22.014
This one needs
to be turned. Okay?

01:25:22.082 --> 01:25:23.049
Looks good to me.

01:25:23.117 --> 01:25:24.084
You'll learn.

01:25:25.285 --> 01:25:27.150
Hey, Ditka!
Knock it off, would you?

01:25:27.221 --> 01:25:28.518
Would you knock it off?

01:25:28.589 --> 01:25:29.886
Dad, relax.
Here, I'll handle it.

01:25:29.957 --> 01:25:30.946
Yeah.

01:25:31.024 --> 01:25:31.991
I'll talk to him.

01:25:34.328 --> 01:25:35.693
Hey, Buck.
Yeah?

01:25:35.762 --> 01:25:37.753
Remember when we beat you
in the championship?

01:25:37.831 --> 01:25:38.855
Yeah.

01:25:38.932 --> 01:25:41.924
Remember when, uh, when
I shoved that kid in the pool?

01:25:42.035 --> 01:25:43.024
Whoa!

01:25:47.641 --> 01:25:49.268
Okay, Buck.
You got me good, buddy.

01:25:49.343 --> 01:25:50.310
Yeah.

01:25:50.377 --> 01:25:51.605
How do you want
your hamburger?

01:25:51.678 --> 01:25:52.838
Well done. Thanks, Buck.

01:25:52.913 --> 01:25:54.540
Okay. You got it.

01:25:55.149 --> 01:25:56.707
Hey, coach!

01:25:57.918 --> 01:25:59.078
Yeah?

01:25:59.753 --> 01:26:00.981
Hey.

01:26:01.522 --> 01:26:02.750
Hey.

01:26:03.023 --> 01:26:06.186
Um, I don't know if you heard,
we won the championship.

01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:07.284
Yeah, I heard.

01:26:07.361 --> 01:26:08.419
Yeah.

01:26:08.495 --> 01:26:11.225
Look, I just wanna say
I'm sorry for the way I acted.

01:26:11.298 --> 01:26:12.560
Hey, let me
tell you something.

01:26:12.633 --> 01:26:13.930
You were
a ravin' maniac.

01:26:14.001 --> 01:26:16.026
Yes, I was.
I was a maniac.

01:26:16.136 --> 01:26:18.195
Yeah, but I see you
changed your ways.

01:26:18.539 --> 01:26:19.665
And man,
down the stretch,

01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:21.674
you did one great job
of coaching those kids.

01:26:23.243 --> 01:26:25.643
Thank you. It means a lot.

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:27.704
So, can I count on
you for next year?

01:26:27.781 --> 01:26:29.009
No.

01:26:30.083 --> 01:26:32.779
Okay. But you and I,
we're good?

01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:34.109
We're good.

01:26:34.188 --> 01:26:35.348
Good.

01:26:35.422 --> 01:26:36.787
How about you
and your old man?

01:26:36.857 --> 01:26:38.188
Better. Yeah.

01:26:38.825 --> 01:26:41.794
Listen. I mean no disrespect
to you and your family.

01:26:42.529 --> 01:26:43.928
But my job in life is

01:26:43.997 --> 01:26:46.192
to make your dad's life
a living hell.

01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:48.128
Hey, do what you gotta do.

01:26:48.202 --> 01:26:49.191
I gotta do it.

01:26:49.269 --> 01:26:51.328
I'm about to make
good on that PelÃ© bet.

01:26:51.405 --> 01:26:52.667
You wanna come
over and watch?

01:26:52.739 --> 01:26:54.070
Yeah, I'd love to
but I gotta get

01:26:54.141 --> 01:26:56.541
all these leaves over in
that yard before nightfall.

01:26:57.177 --> 01:26:58.701
Right.

01:27:05.452 --> 01:27:07.317
We had a bet.
You won fair and square.

01:27:07.387 --> 01:27:08.820
Good job.

01:27:08.922 --> 01:27:11.482
Yes.
Thank you.

01:27:14.127 --> 01:27:15.754
I don't say this enough

01:27:16.830 --> 01:27:18.263
but you really stepped up.

01:27:18.332 --> 01:27:19.492
I'm proud of you, Son.

01:27:19.967 --> 01:27:21.195
I appreciate that.

01:27:22.536 --> 01:27:23.662
The real PelÃ© ball.

01:27:23.737 --> 01:27:24.704
Yep.

01:27:24.771 --> 01:27:25.863
I'm actually
touching it.

01:27:25.939 --> 01:27:26.928
Take good care of it.

01:27:27.007 --> 01:27:29.373
That means an awful
lot to me, that ball.

01:27:31.011 --> 01:27:32.035
It does,
doesn't it?

01:27:32.112 --> 01:27:33.238
Yeah.

01:27:36.617 --> 01:27:37.709
Here.

01:27:37.784 --> 01:27:38.716
What?

01:27:38.785 --> 01:27:39.911
You keep it.

01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:43.417
No. You won fair and square.
It's yours now.

01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:44.479
No.

01:27:44.558 --> 01:27:45.650
You beat me, Philly.

01:27:45.726 --> 01:27:47.455
Well, the Tigers
beat you.

01:27:47.861 --> 01:27:49.726
I mean I had a good time
kicking your butt,

01:27:49.796 --> 01:27:51.661
I'm not gonna lie,

01:27:51.732 --> 01:27:52.994
but i-i-it's not
about winning.

01:27:53.066 --> 01:27:54.624
I thought it was.
It's not.

01:27:55.269 --> 01:27:57.499
About... About
you and me,

01:27:57.771 --> 01:27:59.830
you know, the... the ball
is just a metaphor

01:27:59.906 --> 01:28:02.272
about the distance
between us.

01:28:02.342 --> 01:28:03.468
It's a soccer ball.

01:28:03.543 --> 01:28:04.805
No, no, no, Dad.

01:28:04.878 --> 01:28:06.243
L- I-It's not
about the ball.

01:28:06.313 --> 01:28:08.110
It was never
about the ball.

01:28:08.582 --> 01:28:10.140
I don't want the ball.

01:28:10.917 --> 01:28:12.578
Then what do you want?

01:28:13.987 --> 01:28:16.683
<i> And now an important message</i>
<i>from the King. </i>

01:28:17.224 --> 01:28:18.555
<i>Hi, I'm Buck Weston. </i>

01:28:18.625 --> 01:28:20.149

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:41.342
<i>Don't worry,</i>

01:28:41.415 --> 01:28:43.007

<i>And vitamins. </i>

01:29:00.334 --> 01:29:02.894
<i>But mainly, balls. </i>

01:29:03.570 --> 01:29:05.731
<i>And vitamins!</i>

01:29:06.473 --> 01:29:08.134
These guys
couldn't win a salad bowl,

01:29:08.275 --> 01:29:09.799
let alone a Super Bowl.

01:29:09.876 --> 01:29:11.207
Mike, I smell smoke.

01:29:11.278 --> 01:29:12.438
Nobody's smokin'.

01:29:12.512 --> 01:29:14.139
Besides,
I'm the king in this house

01:29:14.314 --> 01:29:15.941
and I can do what I want.

01:29:16.316 --> 01:29:17.305
Got you!

01:29:17.384 --> 01:29:18.408
Okay, honey.
