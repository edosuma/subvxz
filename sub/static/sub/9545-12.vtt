I'm sorry. I lied. But if I'd have
told you it was a junkyard,

They called him Chicklet.

- He used to work for Michael Karpov.
- Karpov? I was just reading

A homeless man.

He was bludgeoned.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.246
Yeah. It looks like

See these impressions?

05:15.315 --> 05:18.512

why didn't they shoot him?

05:18.584 --> 05:21.678

Erase everything?

05:32.932 --> 05:35.025
Yeah, maybe.

It's like a sauna in here.

It's supposed too be 99 degrees exactly.
It's called the Gidamer method.

08:07.587 --> 08:09.521

08:18.264 --> 08:21.597

You punched a cop?

08:21.667 --> 08:23.692
Yeah. A sergeant.

08:23.769 --> 08:26.704
- Ryan Sharkey.
- Why?

08:27.773 --> 08:29.866
You don't know?

08:31.677 --> 08:34.339
He said you and he
were having an affair.

08:34.413 --> 08:38.349
And you believed him?
Leland, he is lying.

08:38.417 --> 08:41.909
Why would he lie, Karen?
Why would anybody lie
about something like that?

08:41.988 --> 08:44.718
Well, I don't know.
Maybe it was a joke.
You know, cop humor.

08:44.790 --> 08:46.724

If he's convicted, Michael Karpov
is looking at 25 years to life,

09:48.988 --> 09:51.855
which gives us motive
with a capital "M."

09:51.924 --> 09:55.451

- What about physical evidence?

35, maybe 40 years old.

12:40.860 --> 12:43.351
in bed with my beautiful wife,
where I belong.

12:46.198 --> 12:48.132
Can you prove that?
That's not the question.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.293
The question is,
can you prove I wasn't?

12:50.369 --> 12:53.167
Do you own a stun gun,
Mr. Karpov?

12:53.239 --> 12:56.834
What would I do with a gun?
I'm a businessman.
I import furniture.

12:56.909 --> 12:59.434
Sure you do.
<i>And you are a very pretty lady.</i>

12:59.512 --> 13:03.243
Perhaps I could sell you an end table,
hand-carved, from Estonia?

13:03.315 --> 13:05.249
Then you would believe me.

13:05.317 --> 13:07.547
Look.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.986
<i>You're watching me.</i>
<i>The press is watching me.</i>

13:10.055 --> 13:13.889
I would be a fool to sneak away
and do this thing.
And I am not a fool.

13:13.959 --> 13:17.292
Either you did it,
or you hired somebody to do it.

13:17.363 --> 13:20.730
You see that, Teddy?
That is what they call "speculation."

13:20.800 --> 13:24.634
Something that the policemen do
when they're trying to scare you.

13:24.703 --> 13:27.695
<i>Why don't you go play</i>
<i>with your friends?</i>

13:27.773 --> 13:30.833
There was a witness, Michael-
a witness at the junkyard-

13:30.910 --> 13:33.208
who saw everything.
Oh. What did he say?

13:33.279 --> 13:36.043
"He"? How did you know
it was a man?

13:36.115 --> 13:39.243
He just said it was a witness.

13:39.318 --> 13:43.084

because you are bluffing.

<i>If you had any witnesses,</i>
<i>then I would be down</i>
<i>at your station house...</i>

with your son, Michael.

13:56.569 --> 13:58.503

13:58.571 --> 14:02.735

be seeing him for a very long time.

She says she's going
to the movies.

14:23.662 --> 14:27.428
I want you to follow her.
Oh, Captain, no.

14:27.499 --> 14:29.729
You said
she denied everything.
She did.

14:29.802 --> 14:33.363
That sergeant was just joking around.
He was just trying to impress
his idiot friends.

14:33.439 --> 14:35.373
I don't think so.

14:35.441 --> 14:39.036
Karen and me-
We don't even fight anymore.

14:39.111 --> 14:41.102
Last week she said she was
at her friend's house.

14:41.180 --> 14:43.114
I called there.
She wasn't there.

14:43.182 --> 14:45.116
Week before that
it was the same thing.

14:45.184 --> 14:47.209
Leland, don't ask me
to do this.

14:47.286 --> 14:49.083
Monk, I really need to know.

14:49.154 --> 14:51.145
I'd do it myself,

14:51.223 --> 14:55.319
but the chief says I need to go
to this anger management class,
which really pisses me off.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.794
I knocked out a tooth.
One tooth.

14:57.863 --> 15:00.889
It's not like I killed the guy.
Who was that clown?
I've never seen him before.

15:00.966 --> 15:03.298
Ryan Sharkey, Jr.
He was a motorcycle cop.

15:03.369 --> 15:05.633
He just transferred in
from Mendocino.

15:05.704 --> 15:08.264
- Wait. You pulled his file?
- You bet I did.

15:08.340 --> 15:10.331
He's a real hotshot.

15:10.409 --> 15:13.845
Has a couple of big arrests.
He's been cited for bravery twice.

15:13.913 --> 15:17.405
And I hear he's
a real ladies' man.
You want some advice?

15:17.483 --> 15:19.474
Forget what he said.
Just forget it.

15:19.551 --> 15:23.078
Go home and hug your wife.
I don't want any more advice.

15:23.155 --> 15:26.352
I wanna know where
Karen is going this afternoon.

15:26.425 --> 15:29.258
What if she sees us?
She's gonna know that you
asked us to follow her.

15:29.328 --> 15:32.024
- Wouldn't that be worse?
- Worse than not knowing?

15:33.599 --> 15:35.692
Isn't it killing you, not knowing
what happened to Trudy?

15:37.269 --> 15:39.863
How many times
have I asked you for a favor?

15:39.939 --> 15:43.170
103.

16:10.970 --> 16:14.235

Not more than 60.

16:22.147 --> 16:25.241
And, whenever possible,

16:25.317 --> 16:28.912
try to use reflective surfaces.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.582
"Reflective surfaces"?

16:39.598 --> 16:42.032

17:31.150 --> 17:33.880

25:21.486 --> 25:23.545
Listen, you guys gotta help me
get out of here.

25:23.622 --> 25:25.556
It's okay.
You're perfectly safe.

25:25.624 --> 25:27.717
There's two policemen stationed
right outside the door.

25:27.792 --> 25:30.784
No, it's not me.
I'm worried about Devo.

25:30.862 --> 25:32.921
Who's Devo?

25:36.701 --> 25:38.726
[Squeaking]

25:38.803 --> 25:40.737
Oh.
Mouse. Mouse! Mouse!

25:40.805 --> 25:43.865
I fell on the box and Devo fell on me.

25:43.942 --> 25:46.536
If the doctors find him,
I don't know what they're gonna do.

25:46.611 --> 25:49.808
Hospitals hate rodents.
They're like fanatics about it.

25:49.881 --> 25:53.647
- We'll take care of Devo for you,
I promise.
- He's actually kind of cute.

25:53.718 --> 25:56.050
Natalie, don't touch him.

25:56.121 --> 25:58.988
Later on, if we have time,
I'll tell you a little story...

25:59.057 --> 26:01.048
about the Black Plague.

26:01.126 --> 26:03.890
He's not an ordinary mouse.
He's a genius.
He does impressions.

26:03.962 --> 26:08.160
Watch. Devo, look at me.
Do a gerbil.

26:08.233 --> 26:12.499
<i>Uh, be a gerbil.</i>
<i>He's shy, but he'll do it.</i>

26:12.571 --> 26:15.972
<i>Come on, boy, you can do it.</i>
<i>Yeah, go on. You can do it.</i>
<i>Do the gerbil.</i>

26:16.041 --> 26:18.669
[Clicking Tongue]
There it is.

26:18.743 --> 26:22.406
<i>Did you see that?</i>
Yeah. It's uncanny.
He's like Robert De Niro.

26:22.480 --> 26:27.144
<i>Mr. Vengal, uh, those two</i>
<i>burn marks on your neck</i>- 

26:27.218 --> 26:30.085
- Did he attack you with a stun gun?
- Yes, sir.

26:30.155 --> 26:32.282
- And you got a good look at him?
- Oh, I sure did.

26:32.357 --> 26:35.087
I'll never forget that face
if I live to be 40.

26:35.160 --> 26:37.822
And you're sure it was
the same guy that you saw
before in the junkyard?

26:37.896 --> 26:41.525
- Definitely. The same guy.
- Mr. Vengal, we think we know
who did this.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.625
His name is Michael Karpov.

26:43.702 --> 26:46.193
I'd like to bring you down
to the station house later today-

26:46.271 --> 26:48.967
So you can take a good look at him.
We'll set up a lineup.

26:49.040 --> 26:52.441
Mr. Vengal, how we feeling today?

26:54.112 --> 26:56.046
- You finished with this?
- Mm-hmm.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.947
All right, I'm gonna take your pulse.

27:02.053 --> 27:05.545
[Mouse Squeaking]

27:14.699 --> 27:18.658
<i>I'm sorry, folks,</i>
<i>but visiting hours are over.</i>
<i>He needs his rest.</i>

27:18.737 --> 27:20.898
[Groans]
Thank you.

27:20.972 --> 27:23.907
- Are you okay?
- Fine.

27:23.975 --> 27:26.136
My shoulder's a little sore.

27:27.779 --> 27:31.112
Mr. Vengal, good to see you.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.642

28:11.523 --> 28:13.013
Captain?
Hey.

28:13.091 --> 28:15.889
I've been calling you guys all day.
Have you been avoiding me?

28:15.960 --> 28:17.928
Yes, we have.

28:17.996 --> 28:21.796
We were waiting
till we could print this for you.

28:33.611 --> 28:35.636
She's seeing somebody.

28:35.714 --> 28:39.309
I knew it. Who is it?

28:39.384 --> 28:41.284
We never saw his face.

28:41.352 --> 28:44.412
Well, is this the only
photograph you got?

28:44.489 --> 28:48.152
Well, we sort of got arrested.
It's a funny story.

28:48.226 --> 28:50.160
- I don't want to hear it.
- No, it's really funny.

28:50.228 --> 28:52.492
I really don't want to hear it.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.759
- That's Sharkey, isn't it?
- I don't think so.

28:54.833 --> 28:56.960
You look at the shape
of his left ear-

28:57.035 --> 28:59.833
I don't want to hear about
the shape of the man's ear, Monk!

28:59.904 --> 29:03.169
It's him. I can tell.

29:09.380 --> 29:11.314
These things happen.

29:12.984 --> 29:17.148
These things happen.
These things happen.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.894
Screw it.

29:30.235 --> 29:32.533
[Murmuring]

29:34.305 --> 29:36.398
Guys, I've got a lineup downstairs
in five minutes.

29:36.474 --> 29:38.874
I need to fill it out. Volunteers?

29:43.281 --> 29:46.682
- Fine. Prichert, how tall are you?
- 5'10".

29:46.751 --> 29:49.584
Good. You just volunteered.
You're one.
Mr. Karpov, you're two.

29:49.654 --> 29:53.215
I don't need your court order.
You're just wasting
everybody's time.

29:53.291 --> 29:55.953
Yeah, we'll see.
Landau, you're three.

29:56.027 --> 29:58.723
- What's wrong with me?
- Sorry, Harry.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.061
You're... too short.

30:03.168 --> 30:05.227
[Laughs]
That's funny.

30:05.303 --> 30:07.897
That's funny.
Nolte, you're four.
I need one more.

30:09.574 --> 30:12.771
Sharkey, you're in the lineup.
You're five.
Not me, Lieutenant.

30:12.844 --> 30:15.335
I just finished a double shift.
I'm not asking you.

30:16.915 --> 30:19.008
All right, let's go.
Let's do this.

30:19.083 --> 30:21.074
Come on.

30:27.325 --> 30:32.627
[Squeaking]
Gerald, this is Mr. Hoffman
from the District Attorney's office.

30:32.697 --> 30:34.722
Now just relax.

30:34.799 --> 30:38.291
That's one-way glass.
They won't even know you're here.

30:38.369 --> 30:41.236
You ready?
Yeah.

30:41.306 --> 30:43.240
Okay, send 'em in.

30:49.013 --> 30:51.072
That-That's him. That's the guy.

30:51.149 --> 30:54.277
You recognize him,
don't you, Devo?
H-He-

30:54.352 --> 30:56.286
Wait. Whoa.
Don't say anything.

30:56.354 --> 30:58.379
We have to do this
by the book.

30:58.456 --> 31:00.390
We have to wait
till they all step forward.

31:03.828 --> 31:06.092
Hey, you know where
Ryan Sharkey's at?

31:06.164 --> 31:08.189
He's downstairs in a lineup.

31:11.302 --> 31:14.271
Number two, step forward.

31:28.186 --> 31:30.211
Turn to your left.

31:33.691 --> 31:35.659
Thank you.

31:39.631 --> 31:41.861
Number three, step forward.

31:50.975 --> 31:53.170
Is that you?
[Scoffs]
You're pathetic.

31:53.244 --> 31:56.304
Thank you.
Number four, step forward.

32:06.824 --> 32:08.758
Number three, please put
the yo-yo away.

32:12.897 --> 32:14.865
Number four, turn to your right.

What's your problem, bud?

32:21.873 --> 32:24.273
You're my problem!

32:24.342 --> 32:26.708
Number four, please let go
of number three.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.769
Number five, stop kicking.

Ouch.

Number three, please
let go of number four
and step forward.

32:37.088 --> 32:40.854
Ow.
How's it going?

32:40.925 --> 32:43.450
Please stop. Stop. Stop, please.

32:43.528 --> 32:46.053
[Squeaking]

32:46.130 --> 32:48.325
Please let go
of number three.
Whoa, Sergeant.

32:52.403 --> 32:55.804
W-Wait. He's in there.
The killer's in there.

32:55.873 --> 32:59.707
I'm sure he is, Mr. Vengal,
but it doesn't matter.
The lineup is busted.

32:59.777 --> 33:01.870
<i>[Shouting Continues]</i>

33:05.817 --> 33:07.717

That might have been
the worse lineup...

33:07.785 --> 33:09.753
in the history
of law enforcement.

33:09.821 --> 33:12.585
Yeah, it wasn't exactly
textbook, was it?

33:12.657 --> 33:15.217
Captain, what should I do?

33:15.293 --> 33:19.093
You do your job, Randy.
You write it up exactly
as it happened.

33:19.163 --> 33:21.256
Don't worry about me.

33:21.332 --> 33:24.495
Hey, where's Karpov?
We had to let him go.

33:24.569 --> 33:27.094
Sergeant, sit down.

33:27.171 --> 33:29.105
I'm gonna need a statement
from you too.

33:29.173 --> 33:32.939
Leland. Natalie called to tell me
that you've been fighting again.

33:33.011 --> 33:36.845
- <i>Are you okay?</i>
- Uh, yeah, I'm okay.

33:36.914 --> 33:39.940
Why don't you ask
about your boyfriend?

33:40.018 --> 33:45.012
- Hi, Karen.
- Leland, I've never seen that man
before in my life.

33:45.089 --> 33:47.887
Karen, you can stop pretending.

33:47.959 --> 33:49.893
Now you're just insulting me.

33:51.129 --> 33:53.256
Karen, would you just tell him?

33:53.331 --> 33:56.095
Leland- I know you want to kill me.

33:56.167 --> 33:58.101
I'd probably feel the same way,
all right?

33:58.169 --> 34:01.195
But you gotta understand, whatever
happened between Karen and I...

34:01.272 --> 34:03.206
didn't mean anything.

34:03.274 --> 34:05.401
All right?
It was a mistake.

34:05.476 --> 34:08.467
I'm sorry. I'm apologizing to you.

34:08.545 --> 34:12.380
Who are you?
Leland, he must be crazy.

34:12.449 --> 34:15.817
<i>[Sharkey]</i>
<i>Karen, it was fun.</i>
<i>You gotta face the music.</i>

34:15.887 --> 34:17.821
It's over between us, okay?

34:17.889 --> 34:20.983
- Okay, I don't know him.
You've got to believe me.
- Do I?

34:21.059 --> 34:23.458
Yes, you do.
You have to believe me.

34:23.527 --> 34:25.553
Why would he-
Why would he lie, Karen?

34:25.630 --> 34:27.996
<i>Why would he say these things?</i>
Excuse me.

34:28.065 --> 34:32.900
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Are you chewing that apple
on your left side?

34:32.969 --> 34:34.904
Yeah. So?
Why?

34:34.972 --> 34:38.271
Why? Because your friend
knocked my tooth out
two days ago, remember?

34:38.342 --> 34:40.606
Yes, I remember.

34:40.678 --> 34:43.112
But he didn't hit you
on this side.

34:43.181 --> 34:45.114
The captain is right-handed.

34:45.183 --> 34:47.117
He hit you on the other side.
Your left side.

34:47.185 --> 34:50.780
- The side-
The side you're chewing on.
- Okay.

34:52.790 --> 34:57.955
- The captain didn't
knock your tooth out, did he?
- What, are you crazy?

34:58.029 --> 34:59.963
I'm remembering a few other things.

35:00.031 --> 35:02.829
You-You used to work
in Mendocino, right?

35:02.900 --> 35:07.599
When we saw
Michael Karpov in the park,
his son was wearing a shirt-

35:07.672 --> 35:10.539
<i>It said "Mendocino Day School."</i>

35:10.608 --> 35:12.803
Michael Karpov lives
in Mendocino.

35:12.877 --> 35:14.936
Yeah, a lot of people
live in Mendocino.

35:15.012 --> 35:17.446
- I don't know Michael Karpov.
- I think you do.

35:17.515 --> 35:21.076
Ten minutes ago downstairs
you were wearing
those clothes,

35:21.152 --> 35:23.382
and Karpov called you Sergeant.

35:23.454 --> 35:25.581
That's right.
I heard that too.

35:25.656 --> 35:28.557
How did he know
you were a sergeant, Sergeant?

35:28.626 --> 35:31.151
This is Disher.
Is Gerald Vengal still in the building?

35:31.229 --> 35:33.891
You work for Michael Karpov.

35:33.965 --> 35:37.992
We always suspected
there was a cop
on his payroll.

35:38.069 --> 35:42.062
You killed Chicklet, didn't you?
That's why you didn't
shoot him-

35:42.140 --> 35:46.008
Because you knew the bullet
could be traced back to your weapon.
Here's what happened.

35:46.077 --> 35:50.013
<i>You lured Chicklet to thejunkyard,</i>
<i>but he fought back.</i>

35:50.081 --> 35:52.481
<i>He must have hit you.</i>
<i>You were bleeding.</i>

35:52.550 --> 35:54.848
<i>You lost a tooth,</i>
<i>and you had a big problem.</i>

35:54.919 --> 35:58.377
<i>Your DNA was all over</i>
<i>that crime scene.</i>
<i>[Sirens Approaching]</i>

35:58.456 --> 36:01.983
<i>The cops were on their way.</i>
<i>You didn't have time</i>
<i>to clean it up.</i>

<i>You put your uniform on,</i>
<i>you returned to the scene,</i>

36:06.264 --> 36:08.562
<i>but you knew Forensics</i>
<i>would be there any minute.</i>
<i>What to do?</i>

36:09.634 --> 36:12.432
What to do?
Then you had an idea.

36:13.638 --> 36:17.335
I'm your husband.
That makes it my business, okay?

36:17.408 --> 36:19.899
<i>If you picked a fight with someone</i>- 

36:19.977 --> 36:23.003
<i>if you could provoke them</i>
<i>and get them to hit you,</i>

36:23.080 --> 36:25.275
<i>you'd be home free.</i>

36:25.349 --> 36:28.546
<i>They could find your tooth,</i>
<i>your DNA, your blood</i>- 

36:28.619 --> 36:33.022
- You knocked my tooth out. God.
- And nobody would ever question it.

36:33.090 --> 36:35.718
You told my husband
we were sleeping together
so that he would hit you?

36:35.793 --> 36:37.727
Oh, come-Would you-

36:37.795 --> 36:40.025
You can't prove any of this.
I think we can.

36:40.097 --> 36:42.031
We can connect you to Karpov.

36:42.099 --> 36:44.693
We'll pull your phone bills,
your e-mails, your bank accounts-

36:44.769 --> 36:47.135
Yeah, I think you might need
a little more than that.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.571
That's the guy.
I've been telling you guys all day.

36:49.640 --> 36:52.905
I saw him at the junkyard.
That's the guy.

36:52.977 --> 36:56.276
Oh. Uh, hey, are you done with that?

36:59.150 --> 37:01.084
It's not for me.

37:01.152 --> 37:03.552
- It's for Devo.
- Mm-hmm.

37:04.722 --> 37:06.986
Mm-hmm.
He's had a pretty rough day.

37:08.159 --> 37:10.491
That mouse was in my pocket.

37:11.495 --> 37:13.486
He was in my pocket.

37:17.301 --> 37:19.269
<i>Let's go, Sharkey.</i>

37:31.515 --> 37:33.449
Are you okay?

37:37.488 --> 37:39.786
[Laughing]

37:43.261 --> 37:45.422
Heck of a thing, huh?

37:48.532 --> 37:52.161
Actually, it's kind of flattering,
if you think about it.

37:52.236 --> 37:55.797
He picked me because he knew
that I would react-

37:55.873 --> 37:58.307
'cause he could tell
how much I love you.

37:58.376 --> 38:00.970
It's not flattering, Leland.

38:01.045 --> 38:03.479
Look, Karen, I know
that I've got a temper,

38:03.547 --> 38:06.277
but I've been working on it.

38:06.350 --> 38:09.046
I've got a yo-yo.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.680
Actually, the yo-yo broke
when I threw it at the guy.

38:11.756 --> 38:13.656
Why didn't you believe me?

38:16.294 --> 38:19.388
I had Monk follow you
yesterday afternoon.

38:21.032 --> 38:23.557
He saw you meeting a man.
You had me followed?

38:28.806 --> 38:31.468
You wanna tell me about him?

38:34.645 --> 38:36.875
His name is Max Tepperton.

38:36.947 --> 38:38.881
He's a divorce lawyer.

38:39.950 --> 38:42.714
You've been sleeping
with a divorce lawyer?

38:46.924 --> 38:49.051
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

38:49.126 --> 38:51.686
Because I forgive you, Karen.

38:51.762 --> 38:55.323
Hell, I'm no saint.
We'll get past this.

38:55.399 --> 38:57.333
No, Leland.

39:04.775 --> 39:07.676
He's representing me.

39:16.787 --> 39:20.086
<i>"Stottlemeyer versus Stottlemeyer."</i>

39:23.194 --> 39:25.128
Why?

39:25.196 --> 39:27.255
Because you have to ask why, Leland.

39:30.634 --> 39:32.568
That's why.

40:00.498 --> 40:03.092
So is that it?
Yeah.

40:03.167 --> 40:06.227
Twenty years, two suitcases.

40:06.303 --> 40:08.237
Where are the boys?

40:09.507 --> 40:12.908
They're with Karen...
at her sister's.

40:12.977 --> 40:15.969
How they doing?

40:16.046 --> 40:18.071
Not good.

40:18.149 --> 40:22.449
Listen, Captain,
if you need somebody
to talk to-

40:22.520 --> 40:25.683
Here. Just call any time,
about anything,

40:25.756 --> 40:28.350
even in the middle
of the night.
Monk, I know your number.

40:28.426 --> 40:31.486
No, it's not me.
This is Natalie's home phone.

40:31.562 --> 40:33.860
She's really good.

40:33.931 --> 40:35.865
He's right. Any time.

40:37.201 --> 40:39.362
Thanks.

40:39.437 --> 40:42.031
Well, you know the old saying.
"When God closes a door"-

40:42.106 --> 40:45.405
Yeah, "When God closes a door,

40:45.476 --> 40:48.775
sometimes he breaks your heart."

40:48.846 --> 40:51.610
That's not the old saying.

40:51.682 --> 40:53.877
It is today.

40:54.305 --> 41:00.807
