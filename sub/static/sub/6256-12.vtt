00:18.451 --> 00:20.307
Terrence, what the
hell are you doing?

00:20.308 --> 00:22.575
I told you
aluminum is a waste.

00:22.610 --> 00:23.943
Look how big this is.

00:23.979 --> 00:25.478
That's barely 15 bucks
worth of metal.

00:25.513 --> 00:27.046
If you want to make
money scrapping,

00:27.082 --> 00:28.514
stick with stainless steel,

00:28.550 --> 00:29.882
copper or brass.

00:29.918 --> 00:31.384
You know what those are,
don't you?

00:31.419 --> 00:33.353
Screw you.

00:33.388 --> 00:35.355
Keep it down!

00:35.390 --> 00:37.690
Last thing we need are cops.

00:45.066 --> 00:47.233
Hey, I think I found something
in this pile of crap.

00:47.268 --> 00:49.402
I'm telling you,
the good stuff

00:49.437 --> 00:51.571
is buried in the walls--

00:51.606 --> 00:53.172
the copper wiring,
the plumbing.

00:53.208 --> 00:55.508
This might not be a wall,
but it's definitely buried.

00:55.543 --> 00:57.343
Dude, it's shining.
It might be gold.

00:57.379 --> 00:58.611
I got more gold in my teeth.

00:58.646 --> 01:01.347
It's a bracelet,
but it's stuck.

01:06.654 --> 01:08.021
It's definitely gold.

01:10.959 --> 01:14.127
Smells a little funky
from the arm, though.

01:14.162 --> 01:16.596
<i>No.</i>

01:16.631 --> 01:18.831
I've already made my decision.
Absolutely not.

01:18.867 --> 01:22.068
I refuse to pander to the
lowest common denominator,

01:22.103 --> 01:23.536
particularly one
which relies solely

01:23.571 --> 01:25.438
on minimal
imbecilic thought.

01:25.473 --> 01:27.340
But thank you so much
for your call.

01:27.375 --> 01:28.875
Telemarketer?
No.

01:28.910 --> 01:30.243
My publisher.

01:30.278 --> 01:31.778
She wants me to start

01:31.813 --> 01:34.680
a Twitter account to help
promote my book sales.

01:34.716 --> 01:36.682
Can you believe it?
Actually, you know what?

01:36.718 --> 01:38.251
Yes, I can.
You got a lot of fans.

01:38.286 --> 01:40.420
It's a good way to, uh,
you know, connect with them.

01:40.455 --> 01:41.854
I do connect through my books.

01:41.890 --> 01:43.423
Yeah, but that take years
for you to write them.

01:43.458 --> 01:45.058
I mean, this gives fans

01:45.093 --> 01:46.893
a chance to connect with you
till the next one comes out.

01:46.928 --> 01:49.195
Well, how do I say
anything of substance

01:49.230 --> 01:51.097
in 140 characters or less?
Well, I don't think

01:51.132 --> 01:53.966
tweets are meant to be profound
or anything like that,

01:54.002 --> 01:55.735
except if they're Flyers updates.

01:55.770 --> 01:58.304
That's life or death. Booth.

01:58.339 --> 02:01.407
Oh, wow. Okay.

02:01.443 --> 02:05.211
There was a body found in a
bookstore in Southeast D.C.

02:05.246 --> 02:07.046
Bookstores, unlike Twitter,

02:07.082 --> 02:09.715
are the hubs of true,
complex critical thought.

02:09.751 --> 02:12.018
It's abandoned.

02:12.053 --> 02:14.420
Well, that doesn't help my argument.
Sorry.

02:26.367 --> 02:28.801
Buried in a pile of books
from the self-help section.

02:28.837 --> 02:30.970
Ooh.
Definitely not the way I'd want to go out.

02:31.005 --> 02:32.438
I find this
quite tragic.

02:32.474 --> 02:34.140
Well, death is a tragedy.

02:34.175 --> 02:35.575
No, I'm not talking
about the victim.

02:35.610 --> 02:37.310
I'm referring
to the fact

02:37.345 --> 02:38.945
that this is what's left of a bookstore.
Oh, I know.

02:38.980 --> 02:41.414
I used to spend hours
in places like this,

02:41.449 --> 02:42.949
thumbing through page
after page,

02:42.984 --> 02:44.317
looking for the perfect read.

02:44.352 --> 02:45.785
And that fresh new book smell.

02:45.820 --> 02:48.221
Oh, man, an e-book
just does not have it.

02:48.256 --> 02:50.252
Yeah, 'cause who doesn't like
huffing a good book.

02:50.253 --> 02:50.688
Ah, I suppose

02:50.692 --> 02:52.558
you all want to go back
to riding a horse to work.

02:52.594 --> 02:54.594
Okay, let's move it on here.
So, what do we have?

02:54.629 --> 02:57.797
Ripped fingernails suggest
there was likely a struggle.

02:57.832 --> 02:58.931
The oval shape
of the pelvic inlet

02:58.967 --> 03:01.100
indicates the victim
was a female.

03:01.136 --> 03:02.835
- Sexual assault?
- Impossible to tell

03:02.871 --> 03:05.271
till we get back to the lab.
Based on the cranial suturing,

03:05.306 --> 03:07.473
the victim appears to have been
in her early 20s.

03:07.509 --> 03:10.610
The projection of the nasal
bones suggests Caucasian.

03:10.645 --> 03:13.479
Okay, everyone
take a step back.

03:13.515 --> 03:16.582
- Why? What did you find there?
- Uh, uh, yeah.

03:16.618 --> 03:18.317
Bug Boy-- he
rarely warns us,

03:18.353 --> 03:20.620
so, I would, you know,
listen to what he's saying.

03:20.655 --> 03:22.655
It's frightening, yes,
but also, a little bit awesome.

03:22.690 --> 03:24.624
Are you gonna

03:24.659 --> 03:27.260
tell us any information, Dr.
Hodgins, or merely adjectives?

03:27.295 --> 03:28.661
Oh, this webbing

03:28.696 --> 03:32.131
is from a <i> Loxosceles reclusa,</i>
otherwise known

03:32.167 --> 03:34.167
- as a brown recluse spider.
- Oh.

03:34.202 --> 03:38.070
Right. Yeah, I'm not a big fan
of spiders, so, why don't

03:38.106 --> 03:39.505
we just, you know, wrap that up
there so we can get out of here?

03:39.541 --> 03:41.641
Awesome part is,
based on the eggs and

03:41.676 --> 03:45.144
the webbing, the victim died
about seven days ago.

03:45.180 --> 03:47.713
- And the frightening part?
- Well, they can be quite deadly.

03:47.749 --> 03:49.315
I've seen a brown recluse bite

03:49.350 --> 03:50.783
which caused necrosis
down to the bone.

03:50.818 --> 03:52.451
Who cares about that?

03:52.487 --> 03:54.387
Just put the spider
in the container,

03:54.422 --> 03:56.522
seal it up so we don't get
neocro, whatever, all over us.

03:56.558 --> 03:57.924
Necrosis, and it wouldn't
be on us,

03:57.959 --> 03:59.458
it would be in us
because, it's...

03:59.494 --> 04:00.893
Yeah, I'm with Agent Booth
on this one.

04:00.929 --> 04:03.196
Should we get a, uh,
bug bomb or whatever?

04:03.231 --> 04:04.764
No.<i> No.</i>

04:04.799 --> 04:06.566
The spider
is evidence.

04:06.601 --> 04:08.734
Okay, there
he is.

04:08.770 --> 04:10.736
Okay, got it. I got it.

04:10.772 --> 04:12.772
Oh!

04:12.807 --> 04:14.607
Oh, my.
Think that's the only one.

04:14.642 --> 04:16.341
Just, uh, pack up the victim
and head back to the lab.

04:16.377 --> 04:17.857
The techs can sweep
for anything else.

04:17.879 --> 04:19.111
Oh, my God.

04:19.147 --> 04:20.446
Whoa, whoa. What?
You get bit?

04:20.481 --> 04:21.914
No, it's my book.

04:21.950 --> 04:24.784
It was in the clearance section.

Don't think the flesh is going

05:09.128 --> 05:11.662

05:11.698 --> 05:13.901
So far, all I've got are
six freckles and a mole.

05:13.902 --> 05:16.267
Ooh.
That's very useful, actually.

05:16.302 --> 05:18.436
I created this
new algorithm that

05:18.471 --> 05:22.073
maps the location of moles
and freckles and other

05:22.108 --> 05:24.242
distinctive facial
markers, and

05:24.277 --> 05:26.811
cross-references them with
the Missing Persons Database.

05:26.846 --> 05:28.646
Oh. Like

05:28.681 --> 05:31.082
constellation mapping,
but of the face. That's awesome.

05:31.117 --> 05:34.418
Yeah. If this mole
can be our Polaris, then,

05:34.454 --> 05:37.288
we should be able
to navigate our way to an ID.

05:39.225 --> 05:40.591
Oh.

05:40.627 --> 05:42.493
Ms. Warren,
I warned you.

05:42.528 --> 05:44.562
On the platform,
our cell phones are turned off.

05:44.597 --> 05:47.465
- Whoa! Supposition much? I'm innocent.
- That was my phone.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.634
Actually, I just sent out
my first tweet.

05:49.669 --> 05:52.336
Oh, uh, sorry.

05:52.372 --> 05:54.105
You're on Twitter?

05:54.140 --> 05:56.641
- That doesn't seem like you.
- Booth and my publisher

05:56.676 --> 05:58.843
both felt that it would help
nurture my fan base,

05:58.878 --> 06:00.411
and I hope to gain
anthropological insight

06:00.446 --> 06:02.313
into online
sociological behavior

06:02.348 --> 06:05.950
and how it's destroying
interpersonal relationships.

06:05.985 --> 06:07.418
Well, I'm totally
gonna follow you.

06:07.453 --> 06:08.853
Uh...

06:08.888 --> 06:10.621
Sweetie, was
your first tweet

06:10.657 --> 06:13.724
a link to an article about
"Victim Identification

06:13.760 --> 06:15.793
and the Challenge of
Morphoscopic Traits"?

06:15.828 --> 06:17.161
It was.

06:17.196 --> 06:19.997
Uh, Dr. Brennan,
you have to be pithy.

06:20.033 --> 06:23.367
A 200-page article--
not pithy, no pith in that.

06:23.403 --> 06:25.469
This is fun, but we
have a murder to solve

06:25.505 --> 06:27.939
that requires more
than 140 characters.

06:27.974 --> 06:29.140
Ooh, great.

06:29.175 --> 06:30.942
I have an ID.

06:30.977 --> 06:33.377
The victim is Mia Ferrara,

06:33.413 --> 06:36.714
age 22, reported missing
by her boyfriend

06:36.749 --> 06:38.883
last Sunday.

06:42.355 --> 06:43.988
I got that bracelet

06:44.023 --> 06:46.757
to celebrate Mia getting into
the United Teaching Fellows.

06:46.793 --> 06:48.125
College graduates
who teach

06:48.161 --> 06:49.660
in underperforming
school districts.

06:49.696 --> 06:51.262
Sort of the, uh, Peace
Corps of my generation.

06:51.297 --> 06:53.531
So Mia spent a lot of time
in rough neighborhoods?

06:53.566 --> 06:54.865
She didn't care.

06:54.901 --> 06:57.068
She just saw it as a chance
to help the kids.

06:57.103 --> 06:58.402
Uh, we have evidence

06:58.438 --> 06:59.971
suggesting that
Mia died a week ago.

07:00.006 --> 07:02.373
Do you remember
seeing her last Friday?

07:02.408 --> 07:05.977
For breakfast,
but, uh, and I had to go

07:06.012 --> 07:08.512
on a coffeehouse tour
in Virginia for the weekend.

07:08.548 --> 07:10.181
- Yeah.
- I'm a musician.

07:10.216 --> 07:11.649
Oh. Musician. Right.

07:11.684 --> 07:13.250
You never tried to call
her over the weekend?

07:13.286 --> 07:15.086
Sure, but she didn't answer.

07:15.121 --> 07:18.122
Sometimes she got mad
when I went on tour.

07:18.157 --> 07:20.358
And when I came home,
and realized

07:20.393 --> 07:22.393
she hadn't been
in the apartment all weekend...

07:23.796 --> 07:25.429
...that's when
I called the police.

07:25.465 --> 07:28.032
Pretty nice digs for
a teacher and a musician.

07:28.067 --> 07:30.034
Mia has a trust fund.

07:30.069 --> 07:31.535
Oh.

07:31.571 --> 07:32.903
Looks like you'll be moving now.

07:32.939 --> 07:34.538
This is gonna
sound weird now, but...

07:34.574 --> 07:37.775
- she put the place in both our names.
- Yeah.

07:37.810 --> 07:39.377
That does sound a little weird.

07:39.412 --> 07:42.847
Look, whatever you need,
just ask.

07:42.882 --> 07:46.951
I want to find out who did this
to Mia more than you do.

07:51.991 --> 07:53.624
Caroline, what's up?
I was just leaving.

07:53.659 --> 07:55.459
I caught wind of this
teacher case,<i> Cher.</i>

07:55.495 --> 07:57.561
I need you to be extra
careful with this one.

07:57.597 --> 07:59.430
Come on. I'm always careful.

07:59.465 --> 08:01.065
It's not like you
to question that.

08:01.100 --> 08:03.134
I'm sorry,<i> Cher,</i> but
I just happen to be

08:03.169 --> 08:05.436
on the board
of the United Teaching Fellows.

08:05.471 --> 08:06.904
These people--
they do God's work

08:06.939 --> 08:08.272
for inner-city communities.

08:08.307 --> 08:10.307
If word gets out
that it's too dangerous,

08:10.343 --> 08:12.676
the whole program could suffer.
No, the kids

08:12.712 --> 08:14.545
that it could help-- well, that
just makes me mad, all right?

08:14.580 --> 08:16.422
I'm not gonna let one psycho
ruin all that.

08:16.422 --> 08:18.749
See, this is why I get all tingly
when I see you, Seeley Booth.

08:18.785 --> 08:21.052
I spoke with the principal
of the school

08:21.087 --> 08:22.620
to make sure
they knew you were coming.

08:22.655 --> 08:24.155
This is her name
and the name

08:24.190 --> 08:25.656
of the other UTF teacher
the victim worked with.

08:25.691 --> 08:27.058
All right, thanks.

08:27.093 --> 08:28.926
I grew up with nothing,<i> Cher.</i>

08:28.961 --> 08:31.796
No one should have
to fight like I did

08:31.831 --> 08:33.230
just to get a decent education.

08:33.265 --> 08:35.265
All right.
Look how you turned out, huh?

08:35.301 --> 08:37.501
Don't worry about it.
I got all this.

08:37.537 --> 08:39.669
I trust you.

08:39.705 --> 08:42.239
Don't worry.

08:44.710 --> 08:47.711
<i>I already had</i>
<i>two reporters calling</i>

08:47.747 --> 08:50.514
with questions about how
dangerous the school is.

08:50.550 --> 08:53.350
Sometimes I think they love
scaring the crap out of people.

08:53.386 --> 08:56.954
Good news is, I'm not seeing
anything about it online yet.

08:56.989 --> 08:59.690
But I did start following
Dr. B on Twitter.

08:59.725 --> 09:01.926
Hey, that's good, huh?
Tell your friends.

09:01.961 --> 09:03.627
You have friends, right?

09:03.663 --> 09:06.297
That's funny.

09:06.332 --> 09:08.899
So I heard that the, uh, Andy
Lister character in her books--

09:08.935 --> 09:10.434
he's, uh... he's based on you.

09:10.470 --> 09:12.870
That is right, you heard
correct, my friend.

09:12.905 --> 09:15.706
So, why didn't he have sex

09:15.741 --> 09:17.608
with Dr. Reichs
until the third novel?

09:17.643 --> 09:20.578
I mean, you know, what kind
of real man waits that long?

09:20.613 --> 09:22.513
What are you
talking about, huh?

09:22.548 --> 09:24.648
Look, their situation
was complicated.

09:24.684 --> 09:27.551
Sometimes relationships
take a while to develop.

09:27.587 --> 09:29.687
James Bond wouldn't have waited
till the third book.

09:29.722 --> 09:31.188
That's all I'm saying.

09:31.224 --> 09:32.490
People are already
tweeting about it.

09:32.525 --> 09:34.925
Yeah, but in book three,
you got to admit,

09:34.961 --> 09:36.360
it's, uh, pretty
impressive.

09:36.395 --> 09:38.496
You should tweet that.

09:38.531 --> 09:41.565
I guess. I just read the books
for the gore mostly.

09:41.601 --> 09:44.001
Then why'd you
bring it up?

09:44.036 --> 09:46.904
Way to pass the time.
Mm, okay, keep tweeting there.

09:58.050 --> 09:59.450
The latest data shows

09:59.485 --> 10:01.652
that the U.S. is 14th
in public education.

10:01.687 --> 10:03.954
But we beat Slovakia,
so that's something.

10:03.990 --> 10:05.923
Now there's something
you don't see every day.

10:05.958 --> 10:07.424
Guys, come on.

10:07.460 --> 10:09.493
Come on,
put the car down.

10:09.529 --> 10:10.861
Look, please.
I'm not kidding around.

10:10.897 --> 10:12.396
I don't want to get
anybody in trouble

10:12.431 --> 10:13.764
if I don't have to.

10:13.799 --> 10:15.232
Yeah. Go! Go!

10:15.268 --> 10:17.168
What you got?

10:17.203 --> 10:18.836
Oh, hey.

10:18.871 --> 10:21.172
You must be the gentlemen
from the FBI.

10:21.207 --> 10:23.541
FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth.
This here's Agent Aubrey.

10:23.576 --> 10:24.842
Shane Gentry.

10:24.877 --> 10:26.377
I was told
you guys would be coming.

10:26.412 --> 10:28.711
Welcome to South Grant High School.
Great. Thank you.

10:28.712 --> 10:29.970
Do you want us to help
you out with that?

10:29.994 --> 10:30.682
Oh, no.

10:30.683 --> 10:32.883
No. They usually leave it
on the front lawn.

10:32.919 --> 10:34.618
I like to think
this is how we bond.

10:34.654 --> 10:36.453
A handful of the kids
are actually

10:36.489 --> 10:37.821
in my ninth
grade class.

10:37.857 --> 10:39.557
Right, 'cause what better way
to bond

10:39.592 --> 10:40.958
than by encouraging
illegal activity?

10:40.993 --> 10:42.393
Oh, better pranks than gangs.

10:42.428 --> 10:44.261
I'd believe you

10:44.297 --> 10:45.563
if we weren't here
about Mia Ferrara's murder.

10:45.598 --> 10:47.164
Don't assume

10:47.200 --> 10:49.567
these kids are killers
just because they're poor.

10:49.602 --> 10:52.036
It becomes
a self-fulfilling prophecy.

10:52.071 --> 10:53.929
Right. So, did they
mess with her, too?

10:53.954 --> 10:54.574
Mia?

10:54.574 --> 10:56.106
No. No one messed with Mia.

10:56.142 --> 10:58.742
You show us where she taught?
Yeah.

11:04.083 --> 11:07.651
Agent Booth, Agent Aubrey, this
is our principal, Anne Franklin.

11:07.687 --> 11:09.253
I spoke to Caroline
on the phone.

11:09.288 --> 11:10.654
She's a friend.

11:10.690 --> 11:11.789
This is just horrible.

11:11.824 --> 11:13.557
We're all devastated.

11:13.593 --> 11:15.125
We need to know
if Mia had any trouble

11:15.161 --> 11:16.126
with anybody here at the school.

11:16.162 --> 11:17.494
And not just parents.

11:17.530 --> 11:19.697
Faculty, students.
No.

11:19.732 --> 11:22.333
And if she had, I'd make sure
it never happened again.

11:22.368 --> 11:24.101
- Was anyone fired to make room for her?
- No.

11:24.136 --> 11:26.170
UTF teachers don't take away
any faculty positions.

11:26.205 --> 11:28.205
We're supplemental.

11:28.241 --> 11:30.708
And the other faculty members
are overworked

11:30.743 --> 11:34.912
and underpaid, so people like
Mia and Shane are a godsend.

11:34.947 --> 11:37.715
Since they've come, test scores
have been up across the board.

11:37.750 --> 11:40.217
Mia was up 23%, Shane over 40.

11:40.253 --> 11:42.453
Do either of
you remember seeing Mia

11:42.488 --> 11:44.588
Friday afternoon around 4:00?

11:44.624 --> 11:46.290
It was a
district testing day

11:46.325 --> 11:48.525
for our ninth graders.
I had to oversee it all.

11:48.561 --> 11:50.461
And I didn't see her.
I was collating

11:50.496 --> 11:51.662
the exams my class took.

11:51.697 --> 11:53.364
Cigarettes, gum.

11:53.399 --> 11:54.832
I'm sure she confiscated those

11:54.867 --> 11:55.766
from students.

11:55.801 --> 11:58.135
Who's "M.M."?

11:58.170 --> 11:59.270
Probably Marcellus Miller.

11:59.305 --> 12:00.638
He's in her class.

12:00.673 --> 12:01.739
One of her stars.

12:01.774 --> 12:02.806
Nobody thought that

12:02.842 --> 12:05.009
he had it in him except for Mia.

12:05.044 --> 12:06.944
He was an example to her class.

12:06.979 --> 12:08.912
"187, bitch."

12:08.948 --> 12:10.781
That's police code
for homicide.

12:10.816 --> 12:12.950
Wouldn't want that example.

12:16.961 --> 12:19.104
So, Keith, uh, let me
get this straight.

12:19.105 --> 12:20.871
You are Marcellus's
legal guardian, correct?

12:20.907 --> 12:21.907
Yeah, that's right.

12:21.941 --> 12:23.207
So don't try no tricks.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.909
My brother's a good kid,
you hear?

12:24.944 --> 12:28.212
Marcellus, my name
is Caroline Julian.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.780
I'm with
the Justice Department.

12:29.816 --> 12:31.615
We need to ask you
some questions

12:31.651 --> 12:33.684
about your teacher,
Mia Ferrara.

12:34.821 --> 12:37.221
She's dead, isn't she?

12:38.257 --> 12:39.557
- Yes.
- Wait, wait.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.958
I see where y'all
going with this.

12:40.993 --> 12:42.860
Why y'all after Cellus?

12:42.895 --> 12:46.263
Why? Because, uh, no other
kid wrote death threats

12:46.299 --> 12:47.431
to their teacher.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.667
That was
just a joke, all right?

12:49.702 --> 12:51.435
But not to her,
to some other guy in class.

12:51.471 --> 12:52.803
Me and Miss Ferrara,

12:52.839 --> 12:54.638
we were cool.

12:54.674 --> 12:56.607
Right, and you weren't causing
any trouble in her class?

12:56.642 --> 12:57.808
At first, yeah.

12:57.844 --> 13:00.010
That's... that's because
I got frustrated.

13:00.046 --> 13:01.445
You know, I felt dumb.

13:01.481 --> 13:02.880
And my brother ain't dumb.

13:02.915 --> 13:04.215
Like I told her in that
little conference thing,

13:04.250 --> 13:05.370
ain't no bitch gonna make...

13:05.384 --> 13:06.650
You don't use language

13:06.686 --> 13:08.986
like that in here,
you understand me?

13:09.021 --> 13:10.988
He's just
trying to look out for me.

13:11.023 --> 13:12.623
Listen, just been us
for three years now.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.925
He doesn't mean anything by it.

13:18.030 --> 13:20.564
Right. So it must've
made you angry

13:20.600 --> 13:22.967
if your teacher
made you feel stupid.

13:23.002 --> 13:25.436
She was just trying to help me.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.071
She tutored me if I asked.

13:27.106 --> 13:29.106
She said that if
I kept improving,

13:29.141 --> 13:30.574
she'd help me get into college.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.776
I ain't never had
no teacher like that, man.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.278
And ain't no teacher
at that school

13:34.313 --> 13:35.846
- ever helped me get into college.
- Maybe because

13:35.882 --> 13:37.581
when you went to that school,
you used to bring weapons.

13:37.617 --> 13:38.916
The school
make you do that?

13:38.951 --> 13:40.351
Are you gonna blame
every screw up

13:40.386 --> 13:42.319
on other people, Keith?

13:43.222 --> 13:46.156
Cellus, go on.

13:46.192 --> 13:49.627
Tell them what they need
so we can get out of here.

13:51.330 --> 13:54.832
So where were you last Friday
after school?

13:56.702 --> 13:59.904
I went to see Miss Ferrara.

13:59.939 --> 14:01.839
To get some extra help.

14:01.874 --> 14:04.141
She said no, and that's
the first time that happened,

14:04.176 --> 14:05.376
so I just went home.

14:05.411 --> 14:07.144
And that was
the last time you saw her?

14:07.179 --> 14:08.779
Yeah. Then she told me

14:08.814 --> 14:10.781
that she'd make it up to me.

14:10.816 --> 14:13.317
She'd give me
some extra time on Monday.

14:15.521 --> 14:18.522
She was the only teacher
who ever thought

14:18.558 --> 14:20.791
that I could do better.

14:24.096 --> 14:26.363
Yeah.

14:29.168 --> 14:31.869
So the victim's shoes
and clothes have

14:31.904 --> 14:34.104
polyethylene and polystyrene
particulates on them.

14:34.140 --> 14:36.407
Styrene?
Like Styrofoam?

14:36.442 --> 14:37.975
Yes, Styrofoam and plastic.

14:38.010 --> 14:40.644
Now, I also found traces
of the following:

14:40.680 --> 14:43.681
potassium bromate,
sodium nitrate,

14:43.716 --> 14:46.183
benzoic acid,
methocyclopropene--

14:46.218 --> 14:47.918
basically all the compounds
that preserve

14:47.954 --> 14:50.220
that delicious cafeteria food.

14:50.256 --> 14:53.257
So at some point she was
stuffed in, what, a garbage can?

14:53.292 --> 14:54.292
Well, it seems like it.

14:54.293 --> 14:55.293
Now, check this out.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.027
I was also able to pull

14:57.063 --> 14:59.263
some flesh from
the inside of her shoe.

15:01.133 --> 15:03.667
Oh, the purplish-red
color suggests

15:03.703 --> 15:05.102
there was lividity
in her ankles.

15:05.137 --> 15:07.104
So her blood
had pooled in her feet?

15:07.139 --> 15:08.672
Yeah, during hypostasis.

15:08.708 --> 15:11.041
Which means that after
the victim was killed,

15:11.077 --> 15:13.844
she was kept in a
standing position for

15:13.879 --> 15:15.512
about four to
eight hours.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.314
My guess is she was stored
in a semi-public place.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.149
Why public?

15:19.185 --> 15:21.585
Well, I ran an analysis of the
substance she was doused in.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.788
So it was ethanol,
isopropol,

15:24.824 --> 15:28.225
chloro-obenzylphenol,
potassium hydroxide cocktail.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.893
Disinfectant.
Yep.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.496
So the killer was trying to mask
the smell of the body.

15:32.531 --> 15:34.965
So the body must've been
near a semi-public place.

15:35.001 --> 15:38.802
And in something tall enough
to keep it standing upright.

15:38.838 --> 15:40.604
Why couldn't all these tests
just give us

15:40.640 --> 15:42.206
the name and address
of the killer?

15:42.241 --> 15:44.642
Yeah.

15:46.545 --> 15:49.680
Criminal records of everyone
in or tied to the school--

15:49.715 --> 15:51.582
students, teachers,
parents, staff...

15:51.617 --> 15:53.550
Yeah, no, we
already have them.

15:53.586 --> 15:56.320
You really don't trust us to
get this one done, do you?

15:56.355 --> 15:57.955
Just trying to help,<i> Cher.</i>

15:57.990 --> 16:00.424
Marcellus said
the victim seemed to be

16:00.459 --> 16:02.259
mad about something.
Well, I checked

16:02.294 --> 16:04.261
her credit card records,
bus pass, phone.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.530
Nothing was used after
4:00 that afternoon.

16:06.565 --> 16:08.899
I don't think she
ever left the campus.

16:08.934 --> 16:10.334
So she was killed
at the school.

16:10.369 --> 16:12.503
Just what I was
praying to avoid.

16:12.538 --> 16:14.538
You know, just because one
person there is guilty

16:14.573 --> 16:16.440
doesn't mean that they'll
think everyone is.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.308
You really believe in that,
don't you?

16:18.344 --> 16:19.543
Sweet.

16:19.578 --> 16:21.679
Stupid, but sweet.

16:27.253 --> 16:29.720
So Aubrey is checking
out the other kids

16:29.755 --> 16:31.622
and the employees
at the school.

16:31.657 --> 16:35.325
I mean, even the kids, you know,
with juvie records have alibis.

16:35.361 --> 16:36.393
Except for Keith
and Marcellus.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.462
Except for Keith
and Marcellus.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.831
It must be very difficult for
them taking care of themselves.

16:40.866 --> 16:44.368
Keith's only 19; his frontal
lobe isn't fully developed,

16:44.403 --> 16:46.470
so his judgment
isn't yet reliable.

16:46.505 --> 16:47.805
Unfortunately,
that's not a defense.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.173
You know,
I don't get it.

16:49.208 --> 16:51.008
You know, when I went to school,

16:51.043 --> 16:53.043
it was a safe place. Safe.

16:53.079 --> 16:55.646
Some sociologists say
it's income inequality,

16:55.681 --> 16:58.215
some say it's the welfare state,
some blame the decline

16:58.250 --> 17:00.617
of the family,
lower standards.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.519
I didn't really
want an answer.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.755
Oh, that's fortunate, because I
don't think there really is one.

17:04.790 --> 17:07.391
Right.
Mm.

17:07.425 --> 17:11.261
Oh, I am proud to say I'm now
up to ten Twitter followers.

17:11.297 --> 17:14.263
Ten followers--
that is really bad.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.300
It's probably just the squints
that are following you.

17:16.335 --> 17:19.636
You know, you need hundreds,
thousands of followers.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.137
Well, I'm twittering
fascinating articles

17:21.173 --> 17:22.406
I think people would like.

17:22.441 --> 17:24.141
Oh, right, yeah.
Fascinating.

17:24.175 --> 17:25.856
You know, I looked up
your Twitter account;

17:25.877 --> 17:27.958
you were posting articles
on bone disease in cavemen.

17:27.980 --> 17:29.513
Miocene hominids, not cavemen.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.648
Sorry. Well, now
that's exciting.

17:31.684 --> 17:32.983
You know what,
you should ask

17:33.018 --> 17:34.418
that new squint
girl in your lab.

17:34.453 --> 17:36.420
She looks like the tweety type.
I'm fine.

17:36.455 --> 17:38.422
No. You want to be
the best, right?

17:38.457 --> 17:40.257
How can you be the best
with ten followers?

17:40.292 --> 17:41.692
You should ask her.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.393
What, you got another
caveman following you?

17:43.429 --> 17:44.828
There are avulsion fractures

17:44.864 --> 17:46.697
to the right and left
humeral heads.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.932
Okay, is there something
in that that I can use?

17:48.968 --> 17:50.901
Not yet, but I should
get back to the lab.

17:50.936 --> 17:54.538
Sure. A quick lunch together
is better than none, right?

17:54.573 --> 17:57.107
Ten is pretty pathetic.

17:57.143 --> 17:59.877
It's better than nothing.

18:04.316 --> 18:07.084
The greenstick and hairline
postmortem fractures

18:07.119 --> 18:08.952
to the ribs and
scapula appear to show

18:08.988 --> 18:11.455
that the victim was confined
to a very small space.

18:11.490 --> 18:13.791
And based on Cam's
assessment of lividity,

18:13.826 --> 18:16.093
she was confined
in a vertical position.

18:16.128 --> 18:20.030
So there must be other
corresponding injuries.

18:21.934 --> 18:25.903
Ms. Warren, I only have
ten Twitter followers.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.304
Which is dismaying.

18:27.339 --> 18:28.772
Yeah, I can imagine.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.107
I'm used to dominating
any field I'm in,

18:30.142 --> 18:32.609
so I need your help.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.244
Hmm. So now
I'm the mentor.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.746
Okay.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.748
First off, please stop
labeling your tweets

18:37.783 --> 18:39.483
"tweet 1,"
"tweet 2," "tweet 3."

18:39.518 --> 18:40.918
Well, it's an
organizational strategy.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.953
Also no
polysyllabic words.

18:42.988 --> 18:44.488
Keep it casual.

18:44.523 --> 18:46.924
I can't change the title
of scholarly articles.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.091
Yeah, the articles.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.060
I can't even
start with that.

18:50.095 --> 18:52.629
Um, you want to connect with
people on a personal level.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.865
Here, take out
your phone.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.000
Oh.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.270
All right.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.306
Well, you can't take
a photo of evidence;

19:02.341 --> 19:04.575
it compromises
an ongoing investigation.

19:04.610 --> 19:06.677
I'm not, I'm not.
Look happy to be you.

19:08.914 --> 19:11.648
Although our facial
expressions are a bit peculiar,

19:11.684 --> 19:13.450
I have to admit it's amusing.

19:13.485 --> 19:16.053
The art of the selfie.

19:16.088 --> 19:19.356
Okay. "Solving crimes
and taking names.

19:19.391 --> 19:21.091
#WhatDidYouDoToday."

19:21.126 --> 19:23.060
Did you just post that
to my account?

19:23.095 --> 19:24.628
Yep, and I
retweeted you.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.730
Prepare to become a
Twitter sensation.

19:26.765 --> 19:29.566
All right. So I don't know
if these are related,

19:29.602 --> 19:31.902
but I also noticed
these postmortem

19:31.937 --> 19:33.937
moustache-shaped fracture
lines on the parietal.

19:35.574 --> 19:37.574
I know what it is.

19:37.610 --> 19:41.378
It's a standard two-pronged hook
inside of a high school locker.

19:41.413 --> 19:43.647
The victim's head
was shoved against it.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.582
Wait, how did
you know that?

19:45.618 --> 19:46.817
Because in high school,

19:46.852 --> 19:48.585
I was shoved in a locker
multiple times.

19:48.621 --> 19:51.455
This also explains
the victim's shoulder injuries.

19:51.490 --> 19:54.524
Before I tell Booth about this,
do you really think

19:54.560 --> 19:56.460
your strategy of
photographing ourselves...

19:56.495 --> 19:57.794
Taking a selfie.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.997
And yes, I do.
Check your phone.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.034
Ah, I have 98 followers!

20:04.069 --> 20:06.069
Now it's up to 103!

20:06.105 --> 20:07.838
Too bad it would
jeopardize the case,

20:07.873 --> 20:09.172
or I'd selfie
with the skull.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.541
It is a noun, Dr. Brennan,
not a verb.

20:11.577 --> 20:14.511
Right. I'll tell Booth
about the locker.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.781
Oh! 105!

20:20.819 --> 20:22.519
Seek. Seek.

20:22.554 --> 20:25.255
I took a selfie with a
skeleton in my office.

20:25.291 --> 20:27.224
I put its arm
around me.

20:27.259 --> 20:28.525
"#WhimsicallyAmusing."

20:28.560 --> 20:30.027
Right.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.795
You're gonna have to
work on those hashtags.

20:31.830 --> 20:33.563
Oh.
This is

20:33.599 --> 20:34.965
a terrible loss.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.733
Good teachers are rare.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.468
Mia meant a lot to her students.

20:38.504 --> 20:40.671
We're gonna find out
what happened to her.

20:40.706 --> 20:41.872
Good boy, good boy!

20:41.907 --> 20:43.427
You smell something?
We got a hit here.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.809
Looks like we got a hit.
You smell something?

20:45.844 --> 20:47.778
Can you open up this locker?

20:47.813 --> 20:50.414
All right, come on, come on.

20:54.019 --> 20:57.888
This locker is
currently... unassigned.

20:57.923 --> 21:00.924
There's blood smears
all over the inside.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.859
Size of the locker
corresponds

21:02.895 --> 21:05.395
with her postmortem
injuries.

21:05.431 --> 21:08.532
She was placed in here until
the killer was able to move her.

21:08.567 --> 21:10.000
This hallway was
closed because the floors

21:10.035 --> 21:11.735
were going to be waxed
later that night.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.304
Whoa, what's going on over here?

21:14.340 --> 21:16.073
Whoa! Stay back!

21:16.108 --> 21:17.341
Right there.
FBI, okay?

21:17.376 --> 21:18.775
You're not
going anywhere.

21:18.811 --> 21:20.210
Me and my deputy dog here

21:20.245 --> 21:21.645
have a few questions for you.

21:29.266 --> 21:30.866
All right.

21:30.901 --> 21:32.701
Let's take a look
at your record here, shall we?

21:32.737 --> 21:34.570
First of all, we know
that you lied about your name

21:34.605 --> 21:36.739
when you applied for a job
at the school.

21:36.774 --> 21:40.709
You are Steven Brady,
not Paul Garnett.

21:40.745 --> 21:43.178
Then there's
the possession charge,

21:43.214 --> 21:46.482
possession with intent, assault,
assaulting an officer--

21:46.517 --> 21:48.851
that's never a favorite
around here.

21:48.886 --> 21:50.252
Fine. I admit it.

21:50.287 --> 21:51.854
But it ain't easy
getting a job.

21:51.889 --> 21:53.522
I figured
I'm living a good life now;

21:53.557 --> 21:55.924
who needs to know my past?
Good life?

21:55.960 --> 21:59.061
Man's best friend smelled
eau de dead body on you,

21:59.096 --> 22:00.496
and you started to run.

22:00.531 --> 22:02.998
I was worried the dog was
gonna smell drugs on me.

22:03.034 --> 22:04.833
Well, that's a great excuse,
but you weren't carrying, Paul.

22:04.869 --> 22:06.735
On my hands,
my clothes.

22:06.771 --> 22:08.971
Miss Ferrara and me,
we'd catch kids doing drugs

22:09.006 --> 22:11.373
in the parking lot.
But rather than report 'em,

22:11.409 --> 22:13.409
she'd make 'em do chores
and stuff,

22:13.444 --> 22:15.210
you know, give
'em another chance

22:15.246 --> 22:16.845
so they didn't
get a record.

22:16.881 --> 22:19.882
I wish someone had done that for me.
Okay.

22:19.917 --> 22:21.717
But how do you explain the blood
that we found

22:21.752 --> 22:23.919
on your custodial cart?

22:23.954 --> 22:25.287
What are you talking about?

22:25.322 --> 22:26.755
Mia was moved
from the locker

22:26.791 --> 22:28.657
using your cart.

22:28.692 --> 22:31.806
We have evidence on the body
and in the cart.

22:31.806 --> 22:35.197
Anybody could've taken my cart.
It's not like it's locked up.

22:35.232 --> 22:37.032
Look,

22:37.068 --> 22:39.835
Miss Ferrara gave this to me.
For my birthday.

22:39.870 --> 22:41.370
She said I helped her
understand the kids.

22:41.405 --> 22:43.439
Now, why would I hurt
someone like that,

22:43.474 --> 22:46.241
someone who believed in me?

22:51.682 --> 22:53.882
Ms. Warren,
do you have any updates?

22:53.918 --> 22:56.852
Yes. You are up
to 1,023 followers.

22:56.887 --> 22:58.287
Oh.

22:58.322 --> 22:59.955
With your status
as a public figure

22:59.990 --> 23:01.323
and my Twitter expertise,

23:01.358 --> 23:03.025
I think you could build
an online empire.

23:03.060 --> 23:05.427
Well, I was actually referring
to updates on the case.

23:05.463 --> 23:08.497
But I find your Twitter news
#StrangelyExhilarating.

23:08.532 --> 23:09.765
Nice one.

23:09.800 --> 23:12.000
I also found
subtle fracturing

23:12.036 --> 23:14.503
to the sixth cervical vertebra.

23:16.740 --> 23:18.474
I agree.

23:18.509 --> 23:21.443
Interesting that the injury
is specific to the laminas.

23:21.479 --> 23:23.912
The connection between the body
and the spinous process.

23:23.948 --> 23:26.448
Yes. Do you see
how both the anterior

23:26.484 --> 23:30.018
and posterior sections
of the laminas display breaks?

23:30.054 --> 23:33.622
So a strong force compressed
the sides of the neural arch?

23:33.657 --> 23:35.290
Well, I would say
that it was strangulation,

23:35.326 --> 23:38.260
but the hyoid is still intact.
When the victim is strangled

23:38.295 --> 23:40.062
putting pressure on the
lower cervical vertebrae,

23:40.097 --> 23:42.798
the hyoid usually
does not fracture.

23:42.833 --> 23:45.734
Awesome. So we finally have
cause of death.

23:45.769 --> 23:46.835
Celebratory selfie?

23:46.871 --> 23:48.470
Okay.

23:49.440 --> 23:52.708
#YouCanRunButYouCannotHide.

24:00.684 --> 24:02.718
Oh, for the love of God,
not you, too.

24:02.753 --> 24:05.354
What did I do?
And don't sneak up on me.

24:05.389 --> 24:07.589
Why are you tweeting
and not working my case?

24:07.625 --> 24:09.625
I <i> am</i> working <i> our</i> case.
And I know

24:09.660 --> 24:11.593
that the victim had
a Twitter account.

24:11.629 --> 24:13.729
And?
She didn't tweet that much.

24:13.764 --> 24:15.197
Now I like her even more.

24:15.232 --> 24:17.366
Most of the people
she followed were her students.

24:17.401 --> 24:19.801
She used social media
as a way to keep up with them.

24:19.837 --> 24:22.037
Because she wasn't a dinosaur.

24:22.072 --> 24:23.672
It turns out
Marcellus was right

24:23.707 --> 24:25.941
about how upset she was
the afternoon she died.

24:25.976 --> 24:27.709
This was her last tweet.

24:27.745 --> 24:29.211
"Sucks
to be so wrong

24:29.246 --> 24:32.614
about someone. #Heartbroken."

24:32.650 --> 24:34.143
Think she was talking
about one of her students?

24:34.167 --> 24:34.984
No idea.

24:34.985 --> 24:36.818
Angela's going through Mia's
computer now. Maybe she'll find

24:36.854 --> 24:39.154
something that will tell us
who Mia was talking about.

24:39.190 --> 24:42.191
#YouOweMeAnApology.
In your dreams,

24:42.226 --> 24:44.026
Hashtag.

24:46.564 --> 24:49.698
<i>So what did you find</i>
<i>on the victim's computer?</i>

24:49.733 --> 24:51.967
Well, 90% of what was
on her home computer

24:52.002 --> 24:53.835
was dedicated to
her schoolwork,

24:53.871 --> 24:56.271
mostly tracking
her students' progress.

24:56.307 --> 24:58.507
She used these spreadsheets
and metrics.

24:58.542 --> 24:59.741
Wow, she was

24:59.777 --> 25:00.943
truly dedicated.

25:00.978 --> 25:02.778
Yeah, she was
almost obsessed.

25:02.813 --> 25:04.513
And after looking
at these e-mails,

25:04.548 --> 25:06.915
it was clear that she was
losing touch with old friends

25:06.951 --> 25:10.146
and even cancelling plans
with her boyfriend.

25:10.147 --> 25:12.322
Well, being a good teacher can
really take up a lot of time.

25:12.356 --> 25:14.036
Their day doesn't end
when school lets out.

25:14.058 --> 25:16.124
Another interesting
thing though,

25:16.160 --> 25:19.094
her browser history was cleared
at almost the same time

25:19.129 --> 25:21.196
every day.
Was she trying

25:21.232 --> 25:23.398
to hide something?
No, not her.

25:23.434 --> 25:24.866
It was happening
when she was at work.

25:24.902 --> 25:26.301
It was her boyfriend,

25:26.337 --> 25:27.936
and he was covering
his tracks.

25:27.972 --> 25:30.739
I used this forensic
cloning program

25:30.774 --> 25:32.808
to retrieve
the browser history.

25:32.843 --> 25:34.610
He was cheating
on her.

25:34.645 --> 25:36.578
Yeah. With multiple women.

25:36.614 --> 25:40.616
And what's worse is I found
an e-mail to Hunter's account

25:40.651 --> 25:42.822
saying that his coffeehouse tour
was canceled.

25:42.823 --> 25:45.321
So, he was in town
when she was killed.

25:45.356 --> 25:47.289
Yep.

25:47.324 --> 25:49.524
<i>You lied to us, Hunter.</i>

25:49.560 --> 25:51.800
Your little coffeehouse tour was canceled.
I can explain.

25:51.829 --> 25:54.229
You were also spotted at the
school the day Mia was killed.

25:54.265 --> 25:56.069
Yeah, but I didn't kill her.

25:56.093 --> 25:57.835
I was trying to find her.
Not too hard,

25:57.835 --> 25:59.459
'cause you didn't report
her missing for two days.

25:59.460 --> 26:00.080
Look, I know this looks bad,

26:00.104 --> 26:02.571
but I thought she was avoiding
me because she was pissed.

26:02.606 --> 26:05.007
Pissed because of this.
Your DC Hook Up profile.

26:05.042 --> 26:07.609
There is no way you're six-one,
by the way.

26:07.645 --> 26:10.479
You didn't want Mia messing
with your, uh, social life.

26:10.514 --> 26:12.514
I didn't kill her. You know what I think
happened? I think you went

26:12.549 --> 26:14.182
to the school,
and Mia confronted you

26:14.218 --> 26:16.118
about the philandering
you've been doing.

26:16.153 --> 26:18.453
Philandering?
It's a word.

26:18.489 --> 26:20.255
You two started to fight...
I swear I didn't.

26:20.291 --> 26:21.623
Things got out
of control,

26:21.659 --> 26:22.758
you snapped,
and you strangled her.

26:22.793 --> 26:24.226
Look, I
couldn't have.

26:24.261 --> 26:26.962
I was with another girl at a bar.
Mm-hmm.

26:26.997 --> 26:28.797
Right.
When Mia ditched me

26:28.832 --> 26:30.465
and my gig
got canceled,

26:30.501 --> 26:32.501
I needed a hookup.
Can anybody from the bar

26:32.536 --> 26:34.703
verify your story?

26:35.706 --> 26:37.339
Yeah.

26:37.374 --> 26:39.341
The girl.

26:39.376 --> 26:41.610
I got her number.

26:41.645 --> 26:43.512
Ask her.

26:43.547 --> 26:45.981
You have reached
the Get Lost Hotline.

26:46.016 --> 26:48.450
Unfortunately, the person
who gave you this number

26:48.485 --> 26:51.253
didn't want to hear from you
ever again.

26:51.288 --> 26:53.088
We know this sucks.

26:53.123 --> 26:54.523
Wait...

26:54.558 --> 26:57.059
That is not a good alibi,
Hunter.

27:05.500 --> 27:08.001
Have you found anything
pertinent to the case?

27:08.036 --> 27:11.404
I found a remodeled incision
wound to the proximal phalanges

27:11.439 --> 27:13.139
two through five
on the right hand.

27:13.174 --> 27:15.908
This happened because of a deep
laceration across the fingers.

27:15.944 --> 27:18.778
Slight remodeling indicates this
occurred about five weeks ago.

27:18.813 --> 27:20.780
I agree. So...

27:20.815 --> 27:23.616
I was thinking that whoever
stabbed Mia back then came back

27:23.652 --> 27:25.585
to finish the job.

27:25.620 --> 27:27.620
Uh, whoa. Um, aren't you
destroying the evidence

27:27.656 --> 27:28.921
by scraping off
the remodeling?

27:28.957 --> 27:30.757
Not in this case.
The woven aspects

27:30.792 --> 27:33.726
have not yet hardened
into cortical bone.

27:33.762 --> 27:36.062
By removing the new growth,
we should be able

27:36.097 --> 27:38.698
to get a mold
of the initial wound.

27:38.733 --> 27:41.267
Wow. How cool is that?
Very.

27:41.303 --> 27:43.836
Have Dr. Hodgins swab, then make
a Mikrosil of the injury

27:43.872 --> 27:46.439
so we can determine what blade was used.
You got it.

27:46.474 --> 27:49.242
And please use
the Twitter to tell my followers

27:49.277 --> 27:52.211
about the incomplete remodeling
I removed.

27:52.247 --> 27:54.113
They'll be fascinated.

27:54.149 --> 27:56.449
Yes.

27:56.484 --> 27:58.818
Hey, Caroline. So according
to Mia's medical report,

27:58.853 --> 28:02.255
she got 28 stitches on four
fingers about a month ago.

28:02.290 --> 28:03.368
Did she happen to tell
the doctor the name of

28:03.391 --> 28:05.191
the sick soul who stabbed her?

28:05.193 --> 28:07.160
She said that she cut it
on a piece of glass,

28:07.195 --> 28:08.895
but Bones says it definitely
was a knife wound.

28:08.930 --> 28:10.830
You think the boyfriend
took a blade to her?

28:10.865 --> 28:12.398
Well, look at this.

28:12.434 --> 28:14.867
Look where the clinic was
where she got stitched up.

28:14.903 --> 28:17.837
The same neighborhood
where Keith and Marcellus live.

28:17.872 --> 28:19.806
Keith has an assault charge
for using a knife.

28:19.841 --> 28:24.410
I was sort of hoping
it was the boyfriend.

28:24.446 --> 28:27.480
You know, that neighborhood
has been through enough

28:27.515 --> 28:30.049
for us to jump to conclusions.

28:32.220 --> 28:35.922
We're just going with our leads.
That's all we can do.

28:35.957 --> 28:38.391
You're a good man, Seeley Booth.

28:38.426 --> 28:41.728
You sure you don't want to dump
that beautiful doctor you've got

28:41.763 --> 28:43.830
and run away with me?
Tell you what, just give me

28:43.865 --> 28:45.732
a day to think about it, huh?

28:47.369 --> 28:48.701
I'm gonna have
to bring Keith in.

28:48.737 --> 28:50.370
I understand.

28:52.874 --> 28:55.842
<i>Based on the injury profile</i>

28:55.877 --> 28:59.145
on the victim's fingers, you
should be able to reconstruct

28:59.180 --> 29:00.747
what the knife in question
looked like.

29:00.782 --> 29:03.249
Well, let's not endow me
with superpowers.

29:03.284 --> 29:06.018
The puncture wound
to the fifth phalange

29:06.054 --> 29:07.920
marks the end
of the blade.

29:07.956 --> 29:10.757
And the laceration stops
halfway through the bone

29:10.792 --> 29:12.925
on the
index finger.

29:12.961 --> 29:15.328
A distance
of 6.35 centimeters.

29:15.363 --> 29:17.563
Kerf marks show that
the blade was serrated.

29:17.599 --> 29:20.400
Right. Adding that now.

29:20.435 --> 29:22.635
Also, from the Mikrosil, we
know the width of the blade

29:22.670 --> 29:25.471
was four millimeters thick.
No.

29:25.507 --> 29:28.141
From the striae, it appears that
the killer twisted the blade,

29:28.176 --> 29:30.603
so it makes it seem like it's
wider than it actually is.

29:30.630 --> 29:31.812
Mm.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.212
Talk about sadistic.
Maybe.

29:33.248 --> 29:34.981
But an injury like
this could happen

29:35.016 --> 29:37.717
if the victim tried to
grab hold of the blade.

29:37.752 --> 29:39.852
Wow. You really know
your sharp force trauma.

29:39.888 --> 29:41.154
I got to tweet
about this

29:41.189 --> 29:43.556
for Dr. B.
Oh, uh...

29:43.591 --> 29:45.792
Listen,

29:45.827 --> 29:48.628
you're getting
Brennan crazy.

29:48.663 --> 29:50.430
She's more competitive
than other people,

29:50.465 --> 29:53.800
so she's just gonna want
to have more Twitter followers

29:53.835 --> 29:55.468
than everyone else.

29:55.503 --> 29:56.903
What's wrong with that?
It's a waste

29:56.938 --> 29:58.571
of her time, it's a distraction,

29:58.606 --> 30:01.641
and it's contributing to the end
of our civilization.

30:01.676 --> 30:04.076
Twitter is a fact of life, Angela.
Yes,

30:04.112 --> 30:06.078
and life is better
when Brennan tweets

30:06.114 --> 30:10.583
about the most promiscuous tribe
in Timbuktu.

30:10.618 --> 30:13.119
Who else
would do that?

30:13.154 --> 30:15.221
Did I just get slapped down?

30:15.256 --> 30:16.622
Well, I use mind control.

30:16.658 --> 30:18.724
I don't believe in violence.

30:18.760 --> 30:21.260
Should we finish with this
knife? So, Hodgins found trace

30:21.296 --> 30:23.029
of a synthetic
lubricant

30:23.064 --> 30:24.997
in the wound.
Lubricants are used

30:25.033 --> 30:28.334
on switchblades and other folding knives.
Right.

30:28.369 --> 30:32.738
Okay. So if we change the
handle to a folding knife...

30:32.774 --> 30:34.907
we have our weapon.

30:36.311 --> 30:38.411
<i>So, we tested your knife,</i>
<i>Keith.</i>

30:38.446 --> 30:40.279
<i>We found blood in the liner.</i>

30:41.416 --> 30:43.115
Okay, I cut myself.

30:43.151 --> 30:45.084
- So what?
- It's not your blood type.

30:45.119 --> 30:49.355
It's B positive,
like Mia Ferrara's.

30:49.390 --> 30:51.691
Yeah, okay. Whatever.

30:51.726 --> 30:53.960
It's hers,
but it's not what you think.

30:53.995 --> 30:55.261
You know what I
think? I think Mia

30:55.296 --> 30:58.231
came around
to tutor Marcellus, right?

30:58.266 --> 30:59.552
You didn't want her there,
so you pulled out the knife...

30:59.576 --> 31:00.934
No. No, look,

31:00.935 --> 31:02.802
check my rap sheet.
Look, I haven't been arrested

31:02.837 --> 31:05.705
in three years. And I've been
good-- I mean real good--

31:05.740 --> 31:07.017
since me and Marcellus
has been on our own.

31:07.018 --> 31:09.443
But this is your knife, isn't it?

31:09.477 --> 31:11.811
Look, yeah. But it's not
what you think.

31:11.846 --> 31:13.646
I didn't cut her.
You're saying

31:13.681 --> 31:15.381
your brother did?
Cellus? No way.

31:15.416 --> 31:16.549
Look, that crazy bi...

31:19.654 --> 31:23.055
That crazy lady cut herself.

31:23.091 --> 31:24.390
She grabbed
the knife

31:24.425 --> 31:26.826
off the table and sliced herself.
You think

31:26.861 --> 31:29.228
any jury in the world
would believe that, fool?

31:29.264 --> 31:30.496
It's the truth.

31:30.532 --> 31:33.065
Look, she started coming around,
like, a month ago

31:33.101 --> 31:35.268
because Cellus had missed
a couple of days of school.

31:35.303 --> 31:36.736
Look, I work all day,
so that was

31:36.771 --> 31:38.004
the first time
I heard of it.

31:38.039 --> 31:39.405
He started
skipping school

31:39.440 --> 31:40.640
because he wanted to earn, too.

31:40.675 --> 31:43.075
Hated that I had
to do everything.

31:43.111 --> 31:45.278
But like I told him,
that's what big brothers do.

31:45.313 --> 31:49.048
And I wasn't gonna be
like our father.

31:49.083 --> 31:51.417
You didn't know he had a job?
No.

31:51.452 --> 31:54.220
Look, when Miss Ferrara came,
when she showed up,

31:54.255 --> 31:56.856
that's when he came clean.

31:58.126 --> 31:59.892
But then that's
when she thought

31:59.928 --> 32:01.661
I forced him to skip school.

32:01.696 --> 32:03.663
That's when she grabbed
the knife off the table

32:03.698 --> 32:05.231
by the blade,

32:05.266 --> 32:06.832
and she was bleeding
all over the place,

32:06.868 --> 32:09.368
I mean, saying
that-that Marcellus was smart

32:09.404 --> 32:11.604
and if I... if I didn't let him
go back to school

32:11.639 --> 32:14.807
that she was gonna tell
everybody that I attacked her.

32:15.944 --> 32:17.643
So I'm sorry,

32:17.679 --> 32:19.979
but she was a crazy bitch.
So she cut

32:20.014 --> 32:23.649
herself to force you
to keep Marcellus in school?

32:23.685 --> 32:24.884
That's it.

32:24.919 --> 32:26.886
Look, look,
look, look.

32:26.921 --> 32:28.654
I guess it worked.

32:28.690 --> 32:31.891
'Cause Cellus hasn't missed
a day after that.

32:35.263 --> 32:36.629
Let's say we believe you
for a second.

32:36.664 --> 32:38.364
Where were you the day
that Mia died?

32:42.170 --> 32:44.537
Look, I can't tell you that.

32:44.572 --> 32:46.439
Look...
But, look,

32:46.474 --> 32:48.641
as-as God is my witness,

32:48.676 --> 32:52.311
I didn't hurt that woman.

32:56.895 --> 32:59.918
You have got to tell the
other guy-- Agent Booth--

32:59.919 --> 33:02.386
my brother didn't do
anything, man, I swear.

33:02.421 --> 33:04.321
Well, we want to believe him,
but he's hiding something,

33:04.357 --> 33:06.490
Marcellus.
It's not what you think, all right?

33:06.526 --> 33:08.626
Keith knew what Miss Ferrara
was doing for me.

33:08.661 --> 33:10.027
And after that night he

33:10.062 --> 33:11.862
made sure I had a good
breakfast every morning.

33:11.898 --> 33:13.964
Made-made sure my homework
was done and everything.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.799
All right, I need
more, Marcellus.

33:15.835 --> 33:18.435
You know I need more.

33:19.672 --> 33:22.573
The reason Keith
can't tell you...

33:22.608 --> 33:25.109
He's protecting me.

33:25.144 --> 33:27.278
What did you do?

33:28.281 --> 33:30.881
Nothing.

33:32.852 --> 33:35.352
It's just that Keith's
already got two strikes

33:35.388 --> 33:38.455
and the third strike and he
goes away for a long time.

33:38.491 --> 33:41.892
And you go into foster care.

33:45.398 --> 33:47.298
Keith promised that he'd
never let that happen.

33:47.333 --> 33:49.833
Well, I'm sorry to tell you
that it probably will

33:49.869 --> 33:51.802
unless you can
tell us where Keith was

33:51.837 --> 33:53.938
when Miss Ferrara was killed.

33:58.144 --> 34:01.145
He was...

34:04.116 --> 34:05.950
He was at the grocery
store getting some food.

34:05.985 --> 34:07.952
He didn't get paid
for a couple of days

34:07.987 --> 34:11.388
and I had a test coming up, so
he didn't want me to be hungry.

34:11.424 --> 34:13.324
He robbed the place.

34:13.359 --> 34:15.059
Not for, like,
cash or anything.

34:15.094 --> 34:16.193
Just took a few things.

34:16.228 --> 34:18.429
Eggs, milk, stuff like that.

34:18.464 --> 34:20.630
He put it under his
shirt and he ran.

34:24.402 --> 34:28.205
Keith's gonna be so pissed
if he find out that I talked.

34:28.239 --> 34:30.341
Hey.

34:30.376 --> 34:33.277
It's all right, okay?

34:33.312 --> 34:36.380
We're not gonna press charges
against your brother.

34:37.717 --> 34:40.317
You're not?
No charges were ever filed.

34:40.353 --> 34:42.186
And I'm talking to you
without a guardian present,

34:42.221 --> 34:45.054
which means this conversation
never even happened.

34:46.659 --> 34:48.792
Thank you.

34:53.498 --> 34:55.264
Seems the brother
didn't do it.

34:55.301 --> 34:57.635
And the epithelial cells
from the locker were a dead end.

34:57.670 --> 34:59.803
They're from the victim.
Any luck in here?

34:59.839 --> 35:02.039
No luck, but skill and acumen

35:02.074 --> 35:03.727
have proven very fruitful.

35:03.728 --> 35:04.500
Even better.

35:04.524 --> 35:06.745
We are focusing on
postmortem fractures

35:06.746 --> 35:08.712
to the spinous
processes

35:08.748 --> 35:10.347
of the third and fourth
lumbar vertebrae

35:10.383 --> 35:12.416
and blunt force trauma
to the patellas.

35:12.451 --> 35:14.284
The fractures to the
patellas are consistent

35:14.320 --> 35:15.786
with a hard object striking

35:15.821 --> 35:17.788
against the bone.
Question is

35:17.823 --> 35:19.343
why kneecap someone
who's already dead?

35:19.366 --> 35:20.625
And you're certain

35:20.626 --> 35:22.793
the damage to the knees
and spine didn't result

35:22.828 --> 35:24.662
from transporting the body?
These were

35:24.697 --> 35:27.331
intentional strikes.
But why damage

35:27.366 --> 35:29.633
only the knees and back?
It's just random.

35:29.669 --> 35:31.702
No, no, it's
not random

35:31.737 --> 35:35.139
at all. The knees and the spine
are both fulcrums.

35:35.174 --> 35:36.940
Which means?
Perfect.

35:36.976 --> 35:38.976
This makes
perfect sense.

35:39.011 --> 35:40.477
Just once,

35:40.513 --> 35:42.279
I'd like her to tell us
the big discovery

35:42.314 --> 35:44.448
before she runs out.

35:46.652 --> 35:48.352
<i>Because Cam found</i>

35:48.387 --> 35:51.121
livor mortis on the soles
of the victim's feet,

35:51.157 --> 35:52.990
we know the body was stored

35:53.025 --> 35:54.758
in the locker
for at least six hours.

35:54.794 --> 35:57.127
Which means by the time
the killer moved the body,

35:57.163 --> 35:58.762
rigor mortis
would've set in.

35:58.798 --> 36:00.197
So the body was stiff.

36:00.232 --> 36:01.765
That would make it
difficult to move.

36:01.801 --> 36:03.867
Must have been why
the killer broke the bones.

36:03.903 --> 36:06.437
To bend the body.
But typically, you only

36:06.472 --> 36:08.405
have to bend the
spine to fit a body

36:08.441 --> 36:10.574
into the trunk of a car.
Well, then why

36:10.609 --> 36:14.144
did the killer make minced
meat out of the victim's knees?

36:14.180 --> 36:17.147
Angela, bend the victim's
knees 90 degrees.

36:18.317 --> 36:20.250
Okay, now
do the same

36:20.286 --> 36:23.153
for the spine, pivoting
the torso 90 degrees.

36:23.189 --> 36:26.123
Oh, so the body was put
in a seated position?

36:26.158 --> 36:27.591
I've heard of

36:27.626 --> 36:30.127
serial killers like Ed Gein
posing their victims,

36:30.162 --> 36:32.730
making them seem like they're still alive.
Or...

36:32.765 --> 36:35.265
the killer seated the victim
for practical purposes,

36:35.301 --> 36:37.534
because he didn't have
a big enough trunk for the body.

36:37.570 --> 36:39.636
Wait, so the killer put

36:39.672 --> 36:42.139
the victim in the
passenger seat next to him?

36:42.174 --> 36:44.742
Okay, that's really creepy.
So we're looking

36:44.777 --> 36:47.217
for someone with a car
that has seats and no trunk?

36:47.241 --> 36:47.846
Hey,

36:47.847 --> 36:50.914
I found vinyl particulates
that came from an eraser.

36:50.950 --> 36:52.349
Not the kind
from the end of a pencil--

36:52.384 --> 36:53.751
this is a high-end eraser...

36:53.786 --> 36:55.552
Useful if you're
changing answers.

36:55.588 --> 36:57.988
Wasn't there standardized
testing for ninth graders

36:58.023 --> 36:59.923
the day that Mia was killed?
Yes, and

36:59.959 --> 37:02.493
according to Booth,
the same UTF teacher

37:02.528 --> 37:04.394
who administered the test

37:04.430 --> 37:07.264
drives a small,
Eco-friendly car.

37:08.434 --> 37:09.800
These are the tests
your students took

37:09.835 --> 37:11.201
the day Mia was murdered.

37:11.237 --> 37:13.170
Answers were erased
and changed--

37:13.205 --> 37:14.605
all of them.
Changed in a way that makes

37:14.640 --> 37:16.774
you look like an
exemplary teacher.

37:16.809 --> 37:18.609
I <i> am</i> a good teacher.

37:18.644 --> 37:20.644
And the students are allowed
to go back over their work,

37:20.679 --> 37:23.447
so if there are any erasures...
The marks are from

37:23.482 --> 37:26.717
your eraser. We found
your epithelial cells

37:26.752 --> 37:28.318
in the particulates from the eraser.
And when

37:28.354 --> 37:31.421
you strangled Mia, those
shavings from the erasers

37:31.457 --> 37:33.290
were transferred onto her.
Mia caught you cheating,

37:33.325 --> 37:34.591
didn't she?
She was

37:34.627 --> 37:36.860
dedicated to her
students, and all

37:36.896 --> 37:38.495
you did was think
about yourself.

37:38.531 --> 37:39.763
If she turned you in,

37:39.799 --> 37:41.165
she would have
ruined your career.

37:41.200 --> 37:42.599
Come on,

37:42.635 --> 37:44.668
some bits of eraser
are not enough

37:44.703 --> 37:46.203
to prove somebody of murder.

37:46.238 --> 37:48.038
Actually, it is.
There's more.

37:48.073 --> 37:50.340
To position Mia's body
in your car, you used

37:50.376 --> 37:52.409
your steering wheel
lock to break

37:52.444 --> 37:56.180
her bones and acetone
to clean up, but...

37:56.215 --> 37:58.815
see, acetone doesn't mask blood.

37:58.815 --> 38:00.334
Lucky for us, he's not
a science teacher.

38:00.358 --> 38:01.943
Lucky for us.

38:04.757 --> 38:06.857
You don't understand...
No, I don't.

38:06.892 --> 38:09.960
I don't understand, and neither
will the prosecutor, so

38:09.995 --> 38:12.796
if you help us out...

38:15.568 --> 38:17.768
I had an interview lined up.

38:17.803 --> 38:21.572
At the Department of Education.
Mia knew that.

38:24.610 --> 38:27.477
It was a good position.
So you were falsifying the results

38:27.513 --> 38:29.446
to make yourself
more attractive.

38:29.481 --> 38:31.348
I didn't want
to fight with her.

38:31.383 --> 38:33.984
I tried to get
the tests back from her,

38:34.019 --> 38:35.786
but she just kept
swatting me away.

38:35.821 --> 38:37.788
So you killed her.

38:39.158 --> 38:41.592
I just wanted my tests.

38:41.627 --> 38:45.596
But then she started
to scream, and...

38:48.234 --> 38:51.101
I guess I must've...

38:51.136 --> 38:53.070
I don't know.

38:53.105 --> 38:54.805
Strangled her to shut her up.

38:57.643 --> 39:00.143
I thought she would understand.

39:02.147 --> 39:03.747
I mean, who really
wants to teach

39:03.782 --> 39:06.216
in a school like that, right?

39:08.287 --> 39:10.420
What are the odds
that any of them are ever

39:10.456 --> 39:12.990
gonna amount to anything?

39:33.412 --> 39:34.912
<i>You boys both eat up.</i>

39:34.947 --> 39:36.880
I don't want y'all
robbing some store

39:36.916 --> 39:39.516
because your belly's got
a case of the grumbles.

39:39.551 --> 39:41.718
You know what, I appreciate
it, Miss Julian.

39:41.754 --> 39:44.354
Cellus,

39:44.390 --> 39:45.555
where's your
manners?

39:45.591 --> 39:46.690
Thank you, Miss Julian.
Don't talk

39:46.725 --> 39:48.158
with your mouth full.

39:49.862 --> 39:53.463
I heard from the UTF
and they won't be able

39:53.499 --> 39:56.099
to send any replacements
until next year.

39:56.135 --> 39:58.769
Well, Cellus is still
gonna study hard,

39:58.804 --> 40:01.138
right, Cellus?
I mean, that crazy...

40:02.041 --> 40:03.507
...lady...

40:03.542 --> 40:05.008
won't have died
for nothing.

40:05.044 --> 40:06.443
I'm gonna do right by her.

40:06.478 --> 40:07.878
And me,<i> Cher.</i>

40:07.913 --> 40:10.013
Because I'm gonna
be your new tutor.

40:10.049 --> 40:11.848
And you do not want

40:11.884 --> 40:13.383
to get a "B" on my watch.

40:13.419 --> 40:14.818
Understand?

40:14.853 --> 40:16.954
Yes, Miss Julian.

40:16.989 --> 40:18.522
What are you
laughing about?

40:18.557 --> 40:20.657
You're gonna get your GED.

40:20.693 --> 40:22.659
And if you don't,
I'll find some way

40:22.695 --> 40:24.995
to put your scrawny behind in jail.
Well, look, I got

40:25.030 --> 40:26.997
a job.
Oh, boo hoo.

40:27.032 --> 40:28.999
Poor baby's gonna get tired.

40:34.640 --> 40:37.407
You two aren't gonna make me
waste my time, are you?

40:40.179 --> 40:42.045
No, ma'am.

40:45.517 --> 40:48.418
Okay. You two want
anything else to eat?

40:48.454 --> 40:50.487
No, ma'am. Mm-mm.
Oh, of course you do. Miss?

40:50.522 --> 40:52.923
Yes?
Bring these young men some pie.

40:52.958 --> 40:54.758
Oh, certainly.

40:59.631 --> 41:02.032
Thank you.

41:08.607 --> 41:10.374
<i>Can't believe</i>
<i>they gave Christine</i>

41:10.409 --> 41:12.009
homework already.
Well, it's just

41:12.044 --> 41:14.711
tracing letters
to help develop her

41:14.747 --> 41:16.246
small motor skills.
Well, I should be thankful.

41:16.281 --> 41:17.748
It's a good
pre-school.

41:17.783 --> 41:19.883
Right? Plus...

41:19.918 --> 41:22.386
the teachers are alive.
And Christine enjoys

41:22.421 --> 41:24.187
the work. Without challenges,
life becomes dull.

41:24.223 --> 41:25.722
Guess that's
why living

41:25.758 --> 41:27.591
with you is never dull.
You saying

41:27.626 --> 41:30.027
I'm a challenge?
Well, you're definitely not easy.

41:30.062 --> 41:31.862
Oh, another tweet.

41:31.897 --> 41:33.497
You don't have to announce
every time you got one.

41:33.532 --> 41:35.365
I thought Jessica was doing that for you.
No, she felt

41:35.401 --> 41:38.135
I'd learned enough to take
over myself. My publisher

41:38.236 --> 41:39.669
is very pleased. Look-

41:39.705 --> 41:40.937
I have almost
3,000 followers.

41:40.973 --> 41:42.706
Well, look at you.

41:42.741 --> 41:44.975
You're tweeting about, uh,
Caroline's teaching program?

41:45.010 --> 41:48.011
Yes. And some people
have even donated.

41:48.047 --> 41:49.780
The sociological
and anthropological effects

41:49.815 --> 41:52.482
of social media can be quite positive.
That's great, Bones.

41:52.518 --> 41:54.618
I even learned
to use emoticons.

41:54.653 --> 41:57.721
Emoticons? No, no, you're
not, uh, emoticon material

41:57.756 --> 41:59.122
type of woman.
Apparently I am.

41:59.158 --> 42:01.258
Smiley face, wink, wink.
Okay,

42:01.293 --> 42:03.493
smiley face, wink, wink--
it's dinner time. Let's go.

42:04.830 --> 42:06.363
You cooked?
Course I cooked.

42:06.398 --> 42:08.098
What do you think I been
doing here the whole time?

42:08.133 --> 42:10.053
I hadn't really noticed.
Why haven't you noticed?

42:10.069 --> 42:11.768
Because you been stuck
in that whole tweety bird

42:11.804 --> 42:13.170
kind of thing here.
Come on.

42:13.205 --> 42:14.704
I don't think
you deserve this.

42:14.740 --> 42:17.040
Well, it smells good.
Course it's good stuff.

42:17.076 --> 42:18.676
Look at this-- I made
the homemade sauce,

42:18.710 --> 42:21.478
I got salad,
fresh bread.

42:21.513 --> 42:22.879
Candles.

42:22.915 --> 42:24.681
Pretty romantic, Booth.
Yes, it's

42:24.716 --> 42:27.317
amazing what you see when you
step out of the virtual world.

42:27.352 --> 42:29.619
What are you doing?
No, no, no, no, no, no.

42:29.655 --> 42:33.690
What? I think my followers
will appreciate this.

42:33.725 --> 42:34.658
Really?

42:34.693 --> 42:39.229
#BestHusbandEver.

42:39.264 --> 42:41.164
That's not too bad. Yeah,
that's good. Okay, you can

42:41.200 --> 42:42.766
do that. How about a
picture of me serving you?

42:42.801 --> 42:44.334
No, I don't think so.

42:44.369 --> 42:46.136
Right.
Wine.

42:46.171 --> 42:48.071
Yes. Wine, huh?

42:48.107 --> 42:50.574
Tell you what-- why don't
you take a selfie of us

42:50.609 --> 42:54.398
drinking the wine and
you can put #BottomsUp.

42:56.011 --> 42:58.439
I don't think that's a good idea.
Okay, hashtag...
