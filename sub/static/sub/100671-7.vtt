WEBVTT

00:02.307 --> 00:03.224
Shit.

00:04.474 --> 00:05.391
-Did you get it?
-

00:05.724 --> 00:07.015
-What the fuck! Did you get it?
-For fuck's sake!

00:07.099 --> 00:08.516
-Yes!
-Okay, shh. Let's go.

00:10.015 --> 00:11.182
I think we should call
the police.

00:11.391 --> 00:13.849
Why would we call the cops
if we've done nothing wrong?

00:13.933 --> 00:14.891
Daniel?

00:18.307 --> 00:19.140
This is big.

00:19.516 --> 00:21.349
Someone should visit the woman
that reported this.

00:21.432 --> 00:23.099
-Okay.
-Good luck.

00:23.974 --> 00:25.099
Good evening, ma'am.

00:25.182 --> 00:27.015
Did you see anything unusual?

00:27.224 --> 00:29.599
I gave a couple of hikers a lift
at the station.

00:30.849 --> 00:31.849
LAUREL:
The Thirsty Cactus.

00:32.057 --> 00:33.891
Can we do this there?
We can have a drink.

00:34.265 --> 00:35.974
If I don't go and tell
the truth now,

00:36.057 --> 00:37.391
I'm gonna look like a suspect.

00:37.474 --> 00:39.224
If we don't get to L.A.,
we end here.

00:39.307 --> 00:40.391
Why are you doing this?

00:40.474 --> 00:41.307
Run.

00:41.391 --> 00:42.933
Don't say that unless
you mean it.

00:43.933 --> 00:44.808
Run.

00:56.140 --> 00:58.015
Billy:
Come on, come on!
It's our only hope.

00:58.099 --> 01:00.391
Ruby:
There might be other ways!

01:00.474 --> 01:03.474
-We shoulda got a cab.
-No, no!
It's not that kinda town!

01:03.557 --> 01:05.557
-Besides, we were
sticking out!
-Well...

01:05.641 --> 01:07.891
Who's sticking out now,
Billy-No-Coat?

01:07.974 --> 01:09.849
What?
It wasn't my coat! Plus,

01:09.933 --> 01:11.557
-we left very quickly!
-This is mad!

01:11.641 --> 01:13.349
-We're never gonna make it!
-We will! We will!

01:13.432 --> 01:16.432
-Ruby: No, it's too fast!
-We're gonna make it!
Fuck! Come on!

01:16.516 --> 01:17.933
Come on!

01:19.307 --> 01:20.182
Ah!

01:20.265 --> 01:21.974
-You did it!
-Woo!

01:22.057 --> 01:24.474
Come on! Dig!
Dig! Come on, Ruby!

01:24.557 --> 01:27.724
-Ruby: I know how to go!
-Billy: Oh, shit! Come on!

01:27.808 --> 01:29.933
Come on, Ruby!
Come on, you're okay! Come on!

01:30.015 --> 01:32.974
Come on, Ruby!
Yeah!

01:34.265 --> 01:36.724
-We can do anything!
-We're getting outta here!

01:41.474 --> 01:42.891
Woo-hoo!

01:44.933 --> 01:47.766
I can't wait for our
tiny little table.

01:47.849 --> 01:49.099
And my coat!

01:49.182 --> 01:51.849
That's the first thing
we'll do when we get there.

01:52.265 --> 01:54.641
That's not
the first thing.

01:59.641 --> 02:01.474
-

02:01.557 --> 02:03.766
:
Good morning, folks. This
is your new driver speaking.

02:03.849 --> 02:06.766
I'll be with you all the way
to Union Station, Los Angeles,

02:06.849 --> 02:08.849
-arriving at 4:05 PM today.
-

02:08.933 --> 02:11.349
-We're fugitives.
-What?

02:11.808 --> 02:14.182
-We're on the run together.
-Oh.

02:14.683 --> 02:16.099
Wait, are you just
saying this to be sexy

02:16.182 --> 02:18.265
or do you think
someone's after us?

02:19.766 --> 02:22.015
I wanna run with you forever.

02:22.683 --> 02:25.307
-Why? Do-do we need to?
-Wait. Just live in it
for a second.

02:25.391 --> 02:27.557
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.

02:29.140 --> 02:31.099
This is exciting.

02:31.849 --> 02:33.808
-Oh fuck.

02:33.891 --> 02:35.099
Who's that?

02:37.557 --> 02:38.974
Okay, hang on.

02:42.432 --> 02:44.140
-Billy: Hello?
-Hello!

02:44.224 --> 02:45.766
You two lovebirds
requested breakfast,

02:45.849 --> 02:49.015
but, uh, well, we weren't
able to wake you this morning.

02:49.099 --> 02:50.599
Oh yeah. No, we had a--

02:50.683 --> 02:52.474
Woman:
Yeah, I thought you might
need something to make up

02:52.557 --> 02:54.182
for all the energy
you've been burning.

02:54.265 --> 02:55.974
-Oh! That's very nice.
Thank you.
-

02:56.057 --> 02:57.808
Two young people
like you need all the--

02:57.891 --> 02:59.683
-Okay. Thank you.
-Oh! Oh!

03:12.265 --> 03:14.307
She thought that we'd been
in here the whole night.

03:14.391 --> 03:17.307
Yeah, I got that, too.

03:18.140 --> 03:21.432
If
someone asked her,

03:22.432 --> 03:24.099
that's what she'd say.

03:25.766 --> 03:26.974
In which case...

03:29.099 --> 03:30.724
In which case...

03:38.140 --> 03:39.724
Oh fuck.

03:45.849 --> 03:47.474
Laurel?

03:52.891 --> 03:53.849
Thanks.

03:53.933 --> 03:55.516
Hello?

04:13.057 --> 04:14.432
Laurel?

04:15.808 --> 04:17.974
Hi, sleepyhead.

04:18.724 --> 04:20.391
I'm sorry
I couldn't wake you.

04:20.474 --> 04:23.140
Yeah, I...
That's okay. Um...

04:23.933 --> 04:25.683
That's not your job.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.683
-Wow...
-

04:30.015 --> 04:32.099
Wow, there's a lot of...

04:32.182 --> 04:34.182
lot of souls in here.

04:35.974 --> 04:37.683
Guess you're never lonely.

04:42.015 --> 04:45.182
Uh, I was wondering if I could
get that coat that you found--

04:45.766 --> 04:47.766
-Is that the badger?
-Sure is.

04:47.849 --> 04:49.432
You fixed its face.

04:49.516 --> 04:52.224
No, I just took a face
from another badger.

04:53.474 --> 04:54.599
Right, yeah.

04:54.683 --> 04:56.140
I wish someone could
do that for me.

04:56.516 --> 04:58.516
You want me to put your
face on this badger?

04:59.849 --> 05:01.557
-No--
-'Cause that would
make my relationship

05:01.641 --> 05:03.849
with this badger
pretty complicated.

05:07.057 --> 05:09.891
Uh, I think what I did
last night, uh...

05:11.265 --> 05:13.224
with you was very
unprofessional.

05:13.307 --> 05:14.391
I won't tell anyone.

05:14.474 --> 05:16.557
Well, thank you because
I would get fired--

05:16.641 --> 05:18.182
If you let me
make you breakfast.

05:19.224 --> 05:21.057
-Okay.
-And if you clear Daniel

05:21.140 --> 05:23.349
from whatever happened
in that house.

05:24.849 --> 05:25.849
What?

05:26.432 --> 05:27.557
What?

05:27.974 --> 05:30.182
-Is that why you...?
-No!

05:30.891 --> 05:32.516
I was joking.

05:32.599 --> 05:34.849
-Right.

05:36.099 --> 05:38.349
Yeah, that-that's
not my kind of humor.

05:39.057 --> 05:42.349
Actually, um, I'm gonna
get back to the station.

05:47.891 --> 05:49.849
-You having people over?
-No.

05:49.974 --> 05:53.432
'Cause that's an awfully big
mac and cheese in your kitchen.

05:55.766 --> 05:57.808
Where is he, Laurel?

06:01.599 --> 06:02.933
Laurel:
Daniel!

06:06.933 --> 06:08.641
Laurel:
Daniel, don't run!

06:10.599 --> 06:11.933
Mr. Gober!

06:12.015 --> 06:14.015
-You have the right
to remain silent!
-Okay, okay!

06:14.099 --> 06:15.683
-Okay, just take it!
-Where's my cuffs?

06:15.766 --> 06:16.974
-Hey!
-Stay back!

06:17.057 --> 06:18.432
Daniel:
Here, take it! Take the phone!

06:18.683 --> 06:20.432
Cloud:
What? What was that?

06:20.974 --> 06:22.182
Damn it!

06:24.349 --> 06:25.432
Don't!

06:25.641 --> 06:27.849
-That's evidence!
-I don't... I...

06:27.933 --> 06:29.974
Miss Halliday, ma'am,

06:30.057 --> 06:31.099
you are under arrest

06:31.182 --> 06:32.557
for perverting
the course of justice.

06:32.641 --> 06:34.516
-You have the right
to remain silent.
-What?

06:35.808 --> 06:37.099
Hey!

06:44.140 --> 06:45.307
Is he funny?

06:45.641 --> 06:48.182
-Who?
-Laurence.

06:49.140 --> 06:50.474
Um...

06:51.849 --> 06:53.808
-No then.

06:54.307 --> 06:55.683
Is he kind?

06:58.641 --> 07:00.349
-Yes.
-No then.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.974
-Billy.
-Is he gonna take you back?

07:04.808 --> 07:07.349
Come on.
I'm not stupid, Ruby.

07:08.140 --> 07:09.808
I know what you think of me.

07:10.641 --> 07:12.182
You think that I'm vain,

07:12.265 --> 07:15.224
and full of shit,
and that I'm a liar,

07:15.307 --> 07:16.891
and I am.

07:17.766 --> 07:19.140
But, uh,

07:19.224 --> 07:22.099
I'm also fun, and I love
you to fuckin' pieces,

07:22.182 --> 07:25.474
so you took a break
to be with me for a while.

07:26.557 --> 07:28.474
It was always
just a break.

07:28.683 --> 07:31.057
The second I saw that photo
of you and your family

07:31.140 --> 07:33.349
in that fuckin' phone, and...

07:34.849 --> 07:37.057
I knew you
wouldn't choose me.

07:40.015 --> 07:42.224
I've known this whole trip

07:42.724 --> 07:45.015
that you're going back
to him once it ends.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.766
All I've been trying
to do the last four days

07:47.849 --> 07:50.516
is just make you
like me enough

07:50.599 --> 07:52.307
that you miss me.

07:54.349 --> 07:56.724
I want you to miss me

07:56.808 --> 07:59.015
every day for
the rest of your...

07:59.099 --> 08:01.015
fuckin' life.

08:01.099 --> 08:04.015
I want you to... think of me

08:04.099 --> 08:05.724
and want me...

08:05.808 --> 08:08.808
and love me even
though you're with him.

08:08.891 --> 08:10.557
And I need you

08:10.641 --> 08:13.140
to remember me well

08:13.391 --> 08:15.599
'cause you're
the love of my life...

08:17.057 --> 08:20.057
and I know you're
leaving me again...

08:20.891 --> 08:22.557
for good.

08:24.599 --> 08:26.766
And I understand why.

08:28.349 --> 08:30.349
And you're right.

08:31.724 --> 08:33.099
You idiot.

08:34.516 --> 08:36.683
I'm a sentimental idiot.

08:40.766 --> 08:42.933
When I go see him,

08:46.391 --> 08:48.599
I'm gonna tell
him that it's over.

08:53.349 --> 08:56.057
-Is this a windup?
-I've decided.

08:56.474 --> 08:58.599
'Cause we hardly
know each other.

08:59.474 --> 09:00.891
Billy.

09:02.349 --> 09:03.766
Do you promise?

09:05.057 --> 09:06.224
I promise.

09:16.099 --> 09:19.516
I'm sorry that I never
finished your book
or saw your talk.

09:19.599 --> 09:21.307
It's all fucking
bollocks anyway.

09:21.391 --> 09:22.933
-I was jealous.
-I know.

09:23.015 --> 09:24.641
Fucking asshole.

09:27.474 --> 09:29.057
-Show it to me.
-My asshole?

09:29.140 --> 09:30.557
No, your talk! Show it to me!

09:30.641 --> 09:31.933
Oh, uh, no.

09:32.015 --> 09:34.015
-Please, I really wanna see it.
-I would rather show you

09:34.099 --> 09:36.057
-my actual asshole, honestly.
-Well.

09:36.140 --> 09:39.140
-It's more inspiring,
at least for-- Oh, I don't--
-Get it out!

09:39.683 --> 09:41.015
Really?

09:43.683 --> 09:44.849
Okay.

09:45.808 --> 09:47.349
Here we go.

09:52.015 --> 09:53.182
Go on then.

09:54.474 --> 09:56.641
I mean, will you kiss me first?

10:07.391 --> 10:08.599
Laurel:
Daniel is innocent.

10:08.683 --> 10:10.140
Did you even tell
anyone about the hikers?

10:10.224 --> 10:12.724
Yes, I did.
I do know what I'm doing.

10:13.182 --> 10:15.265
I know we had sex last night,
which makes me unprofessional,

10:15.349 --> 10:17.182
but that is balanced out by
the fact that I have reported

10:17.265 --> 10:18.974
every bit of information
you've given me.

10:19.057 --> 10:20.599
The train to LA,
the cancer mom,

10:20.683 --> 10:22.349
the fact that you thought her
name was pretty like a jewel,

10:22.432 --> 10:24.099
and generally, what
a lovely person you were

10:24.182 --> 10:25.265
to take 'em to the station

10:25.349 --> 10:27.099
and hide Daniel
because he's a nice guy--

10:27.182 --> 10:28.599
Stop looking at me like that!

10:28.683 --> 10:30.015
-I am doing
everything in my power

10:30.099 --> 10:32.432
to be on top of
this investigation!

10:32.516 --> 10:34.683
-Ryan?
-Ryan : I've
left you three messages

10:34.766 --> 10:36.599
about a lead on the hikers.
What have you been doing?

10:36.683 --> 10:38.307
I'm investigating
Miss Halliday!

10:38.849 --> 10:40.474
Hey, Ryan, what's the lead?

10:40.557 --> 10:42.808
-Ryan: Miss Halliday?
-What's the lead?

10:42.891 --> 10:44.140
Ryan:
A truck driver reported

10:44.224 --> 10:45.808
a man and woman
jumping off his vehicle

10:45.891 --> 10:47.724
close to the next station
from here.

10:47.808 --> 10:49.015
Yeah. We think
it's the hikers.

10:49.099 --> 10:50.974
Sheriff says we need
to follow the train,

10:51.057 --> 10:52.307
but we don't know
where they're headed.

10:52.391 --> 10:54.599
-I do. They're headed to--
-LA!

10:58.307 --> 10:59.766
-Ryan: Copy.
-Yeah.

11:03.015 --> 11:06.516
Laurel:
So, I guess we should
go get the hikers.

11:07.557 --> 11:09.182
Cloud:
Goddammit.

11:36.933 --> 11:39.808
on the good times

11:39.891 --> 11:42.391
from the grave

11:42.474 --> 11:45.224
-Billy: Don't you dare.

11:48.724 --> 11:51.432
on the blacktop

11:51.516 --> 11:54.349
through the trees, honey

11:54.432 --> 11:56.724
for the next town

11:56.808 --> 11:59.557
catches up with me

11:59.766 --> 12:02.683
:
No! No! No! You are
going to regret this!

12:02.766 --> 12:05.140
Oh. So, this is
what I'm gonna regret?

12:05.224 --> 12:07.265
Yes! Goddammit.

12:07.349 --> 12:09.015
No!

12:14.057 --> 12:15.641
Password.

12:16.474 --> 12:17.641
Please.

12:19.641 --> 12:21.099
Okay.

12:32.349 --> 12:33.349
:
Because we experience--

12:33.432 --> 12:36.140
For the love of God,

12:36.224 --> 12:39.140
just use these.

12:40.557 --> 12:42.391
Hey, hey. Uh...

12:42.474 --> 12:44.224
could I have
two coffees, please?

12:44.307 --> 12:45.891
-Server: Coming up.
-

12:45.974 --> 12:48.391
Uh, one black and...

12:48.849 --> 12:52.182
she takes loads of milk
and way too much sugar.

12:54.974 --> 12:56.516
Yes, we do. It's a fact.

12:56.849 --> 12:58.683
You don't have
to watch all of it.

12:59.224 --> 13:00.933
The opening's the best bit.

13:01.015 --> 13:02.974
:
To be more complex

13:03.057 --> 13:05.516
-than the next person.
Than everybody.
-

13:19.057 --> 13:21.891
-Billy: My love and I made
a pact that one day,

13:21.974 --> 13:23.933
one of us would text "run,"

13:24.015 --> 13:28.224
and if the other person texted
"run" back within 24 hours,

13:28.307 --> 13:31.849
we would meet at Grand
Central Station in New York,

13:31.933 --> 13:33.683
get on a train,

13:33.766 --> 13:37.599
and boom.
One week across America.

13:37.683 --> 13:40.307
At the end of the line,
we'd have to decide

13:40.391 --> 13:41.516
to stay together,

13:41.599 --> 13:43.849
or never see
each other again.

13:47.849 --> 13:49.808
What are you doing?

13:49.891 --> 13:51.557
Who's Fiona Hatwal?

13:52.391 --> 13:54.391
She was the victim. Why?

13:55.140 --> 13:56.391
This is her phone.

13:58.265 --> 13:59.766
-Give me that!
-Hey!

13:59.849 --> 14:02.015
I need to give
this to forensics!

14:10.766 --> 14:13.265
You shouldn't
be touching this.

14:13.724 --> 14:15.307
You thought about
calling the last number?

14:15.391 --> 14:17.808
Yes, I have thought about that.

14:19.391 --> 14:20.432
You wanna try that now?

14:20.516 --> 14:22.432
In my own time.

14:36.057 --> 14:38.224
Listen, whoever this is,
what you said the other day

14:38.307 --> 14:39.599
was absolutely
none of your business!

14:39.683 --> 14:42.683
Uh, this is Chief Deputy
Sheriff Babe Cloud.

14:42.766 --> 14:43.974
Who am I speaking to?

14:45.099 --> 14:46.849
You're police?

14:46.933 --> 14:49.099
-Laurence: Where is Ruby?
-Uh, Ruby?

14:53.224 --> 14:54.808
-Um, who--
-

14:56.808 --> 14:58.391
Who am I speaking to?

14:58.474 --> 15:00.557
:
And whatever happens
next will be the premise

15:00.641 --> 15:03.307
of the new book deal
you are about to offer me.

15:04.182 --> 15:06.307
So, are you ready?

15:07.516 --> 15:09.641
R... U...

15:12.557 --> 15:13.891
N.

15:22.099 --> 15:23.933
Wow, that...

15:24.641 --> 15:26.432
that really got to you.

15:27.307 --> 15:28.808
Yeah.

15:30.474 --> 15:31.641
Really got me.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.349
-Which bit made you...?
-Um...

15:36.015 --> 15:38.391
-Excuse me.
-You okay?

15:38.474 --> 15:40.265
Yeah.

15:40.349 --> 15:42.307
Um, I just...

15:44.891 --> 15:47.057
-I need a minute.
-Okay.

15:52.057 --> 15:53.808
That was very impressive.

15:53.891 --> 15:56.849
I had no idea you were capable
of something like that.

16:00.182 --> 16:01.849
Or maybe I did.

16:07.182 --> 16:09.432
I can see why you're
so successful.

16:09.516 --> 16:11.140
Stop it.

16:22.057 --> 16:23.724
I love you.

16:25.265 --> 16:26.891
You do.

16:58.265 --> 17:00.557
:
Ruby, you need to
call the police. I...

17:00.641 --> 17:02.015
I don't know what
you've gotten yourself into,

17:02.099 --> 17:04.265
but they said
they can help you.

17:32.766 --> 17:35.641
Cloud: If you do
exactly as I've told you,
we can work this out.

17:37.182 --> 17:39.432
Yes, we're--
we're right here.

17:40.432 --> 17:42.307
You're doing
the right thing.

17:43.474 --> 17:45.140
See you shortly.

17:46.808 --> 17:48.641
-What do you got?
-A plan.

17:53.391 --> 17:54.974
Hmm.

17:56.391 --> 18:00.307
Hey. Has a blond, emotional
woman looking for a tissue

18:00.391 --> 18:02.724
-passed by here at all?
-No.

18:02.808 --> 18:05.516
-

18:08.516 --> 18:10.140
-Oh.

18:10.224 --> 18:11.808
:
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've had to make

18:11.891 --> 18:13.724
an unscheduled stop
as a passenger

18:13.808 --> 18:15.641
has pulled
the emergency brake.

18:15.724 --> 18:18.099
We will need everyone
to return to their seats

18:18.182 --> 18:20.683
while we perform our
standard safety checks.

18:26.557 --> 18:27.974
Laurel:
Yes! How are we gonna do this?

18:28.057 --> 18:29.432
Cloud:
"We're" not doing anything!

18:29.516 --> 18:31.391
Laurel:
You take the right side,
I'll take the left.

18:31.474 --> 18:34.265
-You're not coming with me.
You're still under arrest!
-You need my help!

18:34.349 --> 18:35.891
I can do this!

18:37.015 --> 18:38.974
I need to do this!

18:39.599 --> 18:41.307
Stop looking
at me like that.

18:50.432 --> 18:52.015
Alright.

18:53.683 --> 18:54.683
Get 'em...

18:55.808 --> 18:57.015
Babe.

19:02.766 --> 19:04.557
Go home.

19:04.641 --> 19:07.599
We will discuss your
arrest when I get back.

19:10.015 --> 19:11.557
Looking forward to it.

19:29.391 --> 19:30.724
Fuck.

19:38.015 --> 19:40.974
Come on, Ruby. Come on.

19:51.349 --> 19:54.349
-

19:54.432 --> 19:56.808
:
Thank you for your patience,
ladies and gentlemen.

19:56.891 --> 19:58.349
We're on our way again

19:58.432 --> 20:01.349
and we'll have you all at
Union Station, Los Angeles,

20:01.432 --> 20:03.265
in about 20 minutes.

20:04.057 --> 20:06.182
-Mr. Billy Johnson,

20:06.265 --> 20:08.140
this is Chief Deputy
Sheriff Babe Cloud.

20:08.224 --> 20:09.974
I have some questions for you.

20:27.057 --> 20:28.683
Oh no.

20:41.182 --> 20:43.808
:
Thank you for traveling
with Amtrak Trains.

20:43.891 --> 20:46.140
Please be careful when
you exit the train,

20:46.224 --> 20:48.224
make sure you have
all your belongings,

20:48.307 --> 20:49.974
and have a nice day.

21:08.599 --> 21:10.641
Automated Voice:
No one is available
to take your call.

21:36.432 --> 21:37.849
Oh, thank fuck.

21:54.557 --> 21:55.724
Boy:
Mom!

21:55.974 --> 21:57.140
-Mom!
-Mom!

22:02.724 --> 22:04.391
-Laurence: Hey.
-Hey.

22:05.849 --> 22:07.391
Thank you.

22:09.015 --> 22:10.724
How's my baby girl?

22:15.557 --> 22:16.933
I'm not a baby.

22:19.683 --> 22:22.140
-Did you miss me? No?
-No.

22:22.224 --> 22:25.391
-Scooter cried for you
when he broke his arm.
-I did not!

22:26.224 --> 22:27.349
Billy:
Hey!

22:27.432 --> 22:28.641
I don't care
that you saw that video.

22:28.724 --> 22:29.808
It was from months ago.

22:29.891 --> 22:30.849
It has nothing to do
with the last week.

22:30.974 --> 22:32.182
You are such an asshole.

22:32.265 --> 22:33.432
That's correct.

22:34.808 --> 22:37.641
Billy Johnson. Sorry to meet
under these circumstances.

22:39.432 --> 22:41.516
-Hey, fellas.
-Both: Hi.

22:41.599 --> 22:43.557
Sorry. Can we go
to the car, please?

22:49.432 --> 22:51.057
I love you, okay?

22:51.140 --> 22:53.641
I know what you saw,
and it's all bullshit.

22:53.724 --> 22:56.641
Everything I said
on that train was true.

22:56.724 --> 22:58.557
But, I-I don't just
want you to miss me.

22:58.641 --> 23:00.391
I want you to choose me.

23:00.474 --> 23:01.849
I'm about to be arrested, okay?

23:01.933 --> 23:03.391
And I'll face this
shit storm on my own,

23:03.474 --> 23:05.265
but it'll be worth it
if you admit

23:05.683 --> 23:07.557
that you know that I love you.

23:09.808 --> 23:11.557
So, admit it.

23:14.766 --> 23:15.891
Admit it.

24:08.307 --> 24:12.349
then let me be

24:16.474 --> 24:20.057
that a person

24:31.182 --> 24:34.891
then do it

24:38.933 --> 24:42.683
then let me be

24:47.057 --> 24:51.099
that a person
