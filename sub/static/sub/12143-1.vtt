01:43.286 --> 01:45.777
Hey, hey, you're gonna kill us.

01:46.039 --> 01:48.281
If I wreck my brother's car...
Let's just wait.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.539
No, I can't wait.
You can't wait either.

01:51.044 --> 01:53.001
I told you to take it easy
with that champagne.

01:53.213 --> 01:54.956
- You take it easy with...
- Hey! Hey!

02:08.061 --> 02:09.104
Okay.

02:48.810 --> 02:51.431
- You're on private property.
- Sorry, we're just lost.

02:51.938 --> 02:55.805
And you figured she might have a map
tucked up under that dress.

02:56.484 --> 02:59.236
Don't feed me that bullshit.
I know what's going on.

02:59.446 --> 03:00.691
Go do it someplace else.

03:37.817 --> 03:39.193
Hello?

03:42.155 --> 03:43.614
Hello?

03:49.954 --> 03:51.947
- Evening.
- Hey, what's going on, man?

03:52.165 --> 03:53.956
We're on our way down to Danville.

03:54.167 --> 03:56.872
I was wondering if you had a room
where we could rest up?

03:57.087 --> 03:59.874
Maybe like an hourly deal
or something?

04:00.632 --> 04:03.123
Sorry. It's nightly rates only.

04:03.343 --> 04:06.344
But I do have a nice room
for you to rest up.

04:06.554 --> 04:08.132
Cool.

04:08.598 --> 04:10.507
Baby, hurry up!

04:21.319 --> 04:22.694
Baby!

04:22.946 --> 04:25.318
- Come on!
- Keep the change.

04:29.536 --> 04:30.578
Honeymoon suite.

04:32.664 --> 04:34.288
Hurry up.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.619
Let's get to work.

05:08.450 --> 05:12.447
I wasn't shy before we were married.
No reason to start now.

05:37.353 --> 05:38.848
Come on.

06:17.685 --> 06:20.437
- What happened?
- I don't know.

06:30.532 --> 06:32.608
What's going on?

06:40.500 --> 06:42.493
It's okay, babe.

07:02.480 --> 07:05.398
- I don't know. Old wires maybe.
- That was freaky.

07:05.650 --> 07:07.192
We should go back to the car.

07:07.402 --> 07:10.154
Are you kidding me? Now?

07:10.363 --> 07:13.150
Come on, I'm dying here.
Come on, babe.

07:13.366 --> 07:15.026
Please?

07:16.536 --> 07:21.743
Remember, till death do us part?

07:34.220 --> 07:36.130
That got a better view.

07:36.639 --> 07:39.309
Newlyweds are always the best.

07:39.517 --> 07:42.269
Newlyweds and cheating husbands.

07:50.278 --> 07:51.653
- Hurry up!
- I'm coming.

07:52.155 --> 07:54.361
Hey, hey, get your feet off the dash!

08:03.166 --> 08:05.622
Hang on, babe! Hang on!

08:06.669 --> 08:08.247
That kid better slow down a bit.

08:24.896 --> 08:27.648
Hustle back and fold up the sheets
in case we got another.

08:42.706 --> 08:44.912
Welcome to the Meadow View.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.035
I'd like a single for the night.

08:50.630 --> 08:52.623
Got a room open.

08:53.633 --> 08:56.669
- Can I have a print of your ID?
- I left my ID in the car.

08:56.928 --> 08:59.466
The name's Smith.

09:02.434 --> 09:04.473
Not a problem.

09:08.773 --> 09:12.142
You know, I think the pipes
are backed up in 2.

09:15.905 --> 09:19.239
It's number 6. Down on the end.

09:20.118 --> 09:23.154
Enjoy your stay, Mr. Smith.

09:54.944 --> 09:56.403
I'm in lousy shape, man.

09:56.613 --> 09:59.104
I couldn't even make her out.
Is she worth watching?

10:02.786 --> 10:04.992
You gotta put in a new microphone.

10:05.413 --> 10:07.869
- Yeah.
- We can barely hear this.

10:11.503 --> 10:15.547
He don't...
He don't trust your housekeeping.

10:17.008 --> 10:18.586
Probably one of them germ freaks.

10:19.427 --> 10:21.135
Where do you want me?

10:21.346 --> 10:23.504
I want you on the bed.

10:24.307 --> 10:26.264
Face down.

10:26.726 --> 10:29.513
Should I take this off
so it doesn't get wet?

10:43.368 --> 10:45.657
What...? What is that?

13:24.404 --> 13:26.776
I can get you a hundred copies
by the morning.

13:27.198 --> 13:29.321
Make it 25.

13:30.118 --> 13:31.660
Sales are slow.

13:31.870 --> 13:33.494
Same old shit. It's getting old.

13:33.705 --> 13:34.985
Are you kidding me?

13:35.248 --> 13:37.157
Look at her.

13:37.375 --> 13:40.210
What you have here is classic.

13:43.214 --> 13:45.041
Twenty-five.

13:55.477 --> 13:57.303
- What's going on?
- We have a problem.

13:57.562 --> 13:59.555
- Reece!
- This guy...

14:03.193 --> 14:07.522
- What's the problem?
- It's nothing we can't handle.

14:41.314 --> 14:43.603
Jesus.

14:46.986 --> 14:48.860
What the hell is this? This shit real?

14:49.864 --> 14:51.524
Oh, yeah.

14:54.369 --> 14:56.160
Damn.

14:56.871 --> 15:00.121
Where's this guy here?
Right... That dude.

15:10.927 --> 15:13.465
We have no idea what to do with him.

15:29.946 --> 15:31.689
Did he know her?

15:36.619 --> 15:38.411
Who's the lady?

15:39.831 --> 15:43.034
She must have killed herself
when I checked out.

15:43.251 --> 15:46.169
You in the habit
of murdering strange women?

15:47.630 --> 15:49.588
We got it all on video.

15:49.799 --> 15:53.049
All of it. Everything.

15:57.891 --> 16:02.849
Just my luck, huh?
A couple of peeping Toms.

16:17.827 --> 16:20.153
Should we call the cops?

16:20.372 --> 16:24.618
This is... This is a murder scene.

16:24.834 --> 16:28.120
You call the cops, all right,
they start asking questions.

16:28.338 --> 16:31.458
You run the risk
of exposing your operation.

16:34.552 --> 16:36.260
We could kill him.

16:39.516 --> 16:41.841
We yank the camera.

16:42.060 --> 16:44.515
We heard screams,
but we couldn't get there in time.

16:44.729 --> 16:48.774
- Or you could untie me.
- What was that?

16:48.983 --> 16:50.857
You could untie me.

16:52.821 --> 16:54.363
Put my skills to use.

17:03.540 --> 17:05.413
You've got a...

17:06.251 --> 17:11.625
You've got a setup here.
It's a real moneymaker.

17:12.589 --> 17:15.046
Nobody buys porn anymore.

17:16.176 --> 17:17.885
But killing...

17:18.930 --> 17:21.338
Killing is different, you know.

17:23.101 --> 17:25.592
Watching somebody die...

17:25.811 --> 17:29.810
I mean, that's rare. It's valuable.

17:31.109 --> 17:33.315
We could work together.

17:37.866 --> 17:42.160
We could sell 10,000 copies easy.

17:57.969 --> 18:00.128
Well, you know...

18:00.889 --> 18:04.258
there is a market
for this type of deal.

18:06.352 --> 18:09.270
As soon as we untie him
he's gonna take off.

18:09.481 --> 18:13.525
Getting paid to kill. What better deal
am I gonna get than that?

18:13.735 --> 18:16.190
Who said anything
about getting paid?

18:16.404 --> 18:20.698
Well, I am doing the dirty work.
I get equal cut.

18:20.950 --> 18:25.031
You got big demands
for a fella tied to a chair.

18:25.246 --> 18:26.906
Equal.

18:28.917 --> 18:32.037
Otherwise, wrap me up with her
when you're finished.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.610
Give me the knife.

19:20.719 --> 19:24.882
Gordon, what's to keep him
from wrapping us up in plastic?

19:33.523 --> 19:35.812
You get out of line...

19:36.401 --> 19:40.481
someone anonymously drops
that tape off to the police.

19:41.531 --> 19:45.149
He's gonna have another copy,
so if something happens to us...

19:45.702 --> 19:47.944
well, he'll take care of the rest.

19:49.873 --> 19:52.114
Now, let's get something straight.

19:53.084 --> 19:55.243
I run the show here.

19:57.255 --> 19:59.828
I wouldn't have it any other way.

20:11.770 --> 20:14.557
Are you sure about this?

20:15.899 --> 20:20.359
If it doesn't work,
empty your shotgun into him.

20:24.157 --> 20:28.618
Let's shut down for a few days.
Get everything in order.

20:32.207 --> 20:35.124
Let's go bury
our first star someplace.

21:20.839 --> 21:22.831
Eight hundred miles.

21:23.049 --> 21:25.801
It's a long way from home.

21:29.514 --> 21:31.720
Home is where the heart is, Caleb.

21:31.933 --> 21:33.427
Don't you ever forget that.

21:39.315 --> 21:41.806
I thought you were serious.
I was about to jump out.

21:42.318 --> 21:45.355
Don't do that. They might not
find your body out here for weeks.

21:49.492 --> 21:51.319
This was a mistake.

21:51.536 --> 21:54.537
You're over-thinking again.
Everything is gonna be fine.

21:54.748 --> 21:56.989
I mean, what if your father
doesn't like me?

21:57.208 --> 21:59.497
Why would he not like you?
You're almost perfect.

22:00.170 --> 22:02.839
- Almost?
- Yeah.

22:03.048 --> 22:06.796
Yeah, everything except for
that weird sideburn defect you have.

22:07.052 --> 22:09.009
- Hey, my sideburns.
- They're never even.

22:09.220 --> 22:13.004
You don't know the difference between
a socket and crescent wrench.

22:13.224 --> 22:17.352
And there's that little issue of you
stealing his only daughter away, but...

22:17.562 --> 22:20.397
- I'm sure it'll be fine.
- Oh, Jesus.

22:20.732 --> 22:22.309
This is such a mistake.

22:26.029 --> 22:28.484
Yes, this is a mistake! So turn back.

22:28.698 --> 22:31.154
Go back now, dude.
Let's just go back. Let's go home.

22:31.368 --> 22:34.203
You promised you were gonna be
sleeping the rest of the way.

22:34.412 --> 22:36.820
How can I sleep
when my best friend is about to...

22:37.165 --> 22:39.241
disappear into
the Virginia wilderness?

22:39.918 --> 22:42.669
- It's North Carolina.
- Same difference.

22:42.921 --> 22:47.084
All outhouses and corn bread
and damn AM radio.

22:47.300 --> 22:50.503
- You're an idiot, you know that?
- That's irrelevant.

22:50.762 --> 22:53.597
I bet you that at some time
during your youth out here...

22:53.807 --> 22:55.930
your old man taught you
how to hunt.

22:56.142 --> 22:59.345
Didn't he? Come on, tell the truth.
I know you know how to hunt.

22:59.562 --> 23:01.970
Right? Come on, didn't he?

23:02.190 --> 23:04.479
Hunting does not
make somebody a hillbilly.

23:04.692 --> 23:07.100
I knew it.
I told you, what'd I tell you?

23:07.487 --> 23:08.650
Why are you even here?

23:08.863 --> 23:11.817
To help my boy Caleb
with all this shit back here, remember?

23:12.033 --> 23:15.782
Because you're not supposed to do any
heavy lifting in your present condition.

23:16.621 --> 23:19.741
Reason number 27 why Daddy's
not gonna think you're perfect, dude.

23:22.001 --> 23:24.919
He's just messing with you.

23:25.130 --> 23:26.956
Tell her you're just fucking around.

23:27.173 --> 23:30.507
- I am just fucking around, man.
- Thanks.

23:34.013 --> 23:36.587
So, what's our ETA into Hooterville?

23:37.308 --> 23:39.930
A few more hours, Tanner.

23:40.562 --> 23:45.058
Well, I'm not the smartest guy, but it
might not be the best first impression...

23:45.275 --> 23:48.395
waking up the family
at 3 in the morning.

23:49.529 --> 23:53.194
- What do you think, Jess?
- Whatever you want, babe.

23:54.242 --> 23:58.619
It'd give me a chance to shower.
Even out these sideburns.

24:00.457 --> 24:02.034
You know what?

24:02.709 --> 24:04.203
You're right.

24:05.336 --> 24:07.413
It's going to be perfect.

24:48.922 --> 24:50.464
Meadow View, great.

24:50.673 --> 24:53.295
Add it to the list of other
high-class motels we passed.

24:53.510 --> 24:56.214
Prairie View, River View,
Mountain View.

24:56.429 --> 24:58.256
Somebody should come up
with Titty View.

24:58.473 --> 25:00.845
Now, that is a joint
I wouldn't mind staying in.

25:01.101 --> 25:04.018
That sounds nice. Titty View.

25:04.646 --> 25:07.433
You have to make it so easy
for her to see you're an idiot?

25:07.649 --> 25:10.566
- What?
- Stop trying to press her buttons.

25:10.819 --> 25:14.353
It's hard not to, dude. There's just
so many damn buttons to push.

25:15.365 --> 25:17.772
Hey. Tanner's just pissed
because I'm leaving.

25:17.992 --> 25:19.570
All right? Don't worry about it.

25:19.786 --> 25:21.944
We've been hanging out
since the first grade.

25:22.163 --> 25:23.955
I'm like the only friend he's got.

25:24.165 --> 25:25.280
That's a shocker.

25:25.542 --> 25:28.543
Why don't you remind him
that you guys aren't 8 anymore?

25:33.842 --> 25:35.918
Meadow View.

25:38.179 --> 25:39.971
Hello?

25:44.769 --> 25:46.263
Hello?

25:49.441 --> 25:51.314
Sorry for the wait.

25:52.986 --> 25:55.144
A little too much iced tea tonight.

25:58.199 --> 26:00.406
No problem.
We're just looking to grab a room.

26:00.618 --> 26:02.944
Oh, we have some of those.

26:04.330 --> 26:06.122
It's for the two of you?

26:07.250 --> 26:10.666
The couples' rate is 49 a night.
Includes air and cable.

26:11.212 --> 26:14.416
- Well, we actually need...
- No, that's it. Sounds good.

26:27.479 --> 26:29.804
Where are you folks moving from?

26:31.983 --> 26:33.312
The trailer.

26:34.110 --> 26:36.862
Oh, yeah. Chicago.

26:37.572 --> 26:40.656
We're on our way to Beulah.
That's where my family's from.

26:40.909 --> 26:43.779
Oh, you're not far now.
It's beautiful, very peaceful.

26:43.995 --> 26:46.996
Feels like you're in
the middle of nowhere.

26:47.207 --> 26:49.994
- Great.
- So you're in room 6.

26:50.251 --> 26:51.662
Just down near the end.

26:51.878 --> 26:53.041
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

26:53.296 --> 26:54.838
I hope you enjoy your stay.

26:55.048 --> 26:58.547
And if you need anything,
don't hesitate to scream.

27:05.892 --> 27:08.846
So we get to have a room
with Tanner again.

27:09.062 --> 27:12.645
We'll stick him on the floor.
It's only for a couple hours.

27:18.488 --> 27:20.196
Where'd he go now?

27:21.282 --> 27:23.489
We didn't pass any bars
coming in, did we?

27:23.702 --> 27:29.787
No, not that I saw. But he has, like,
a special radar for those places.

27:30.041 --> 27:31.535
Fuck him, he'll find us.

27:45.348 --> 27:48.515
Oh, God. See that squirrel?

27:48.810 --> 27:50.767
That was gross.

28:08.121 --> 28:11.572
Oh, my God. What a mess.

28:11.791 --> 28:14.329
It'll be fine.
We'll fix it when we get there.

28:14.544 --> 28:16.287
Yeah.

28:19.716 --> 28:22.503
You up for a little dip before bed?

28:22.761 --> 28:24.255
It's all yours. Go first.

28:24.471 --> 28:27.341
The least we could do
is grab the squirrel for your dad.

28:27.557 --> 28:30.843
Save him having to
hunt down lunch tomorrow.

28:31.061 --> 28:32.638
I'll tell him that you said that.

28:32.854 --> 28:34.763
Did I mention he's 6'5"
and used to box?

28:34.981 --> 28:38.432
- Oh, that's it. You're going in.
- No, Caleb! No, no, no!

28:51.122 --> 28:53.364
This is actually pretty nice.

28:53.625 --> 28:55.452
Yeah, it's not bad.

29:00.757 --> 29:04.755
Better tell Tanner not to make
a big entrance when he shows up.

29:06.679 --> 29:10.428
- I got nothing.
- Yeah, me either.

29:10.642 --> 29:12.634
It's the middle of nowhere.

29:12.894 --> 29:16.643
Why do you need to call him anyway?
He'll find us. He always does.

29:16.856 --> 29:18.979
Let's hurry.

29:19.192 --> 29:22.276
We don't want to waste
what little privacy we've got.

29:27.701 --> 29:30.618
Are you sure we're doing
the right thing?

29:30.829 --> 29:35.076
We'll get cell-phone reception
as soon as we get into town, I promise.

29:36.835 --> 29:39.622
No, I'm talking about
everything else.

29:39.838 --> 29:44.001
Living around your family,
me working for your father.

29:46.469 --> 29:49.043
Chicago's not going
anywhere, Caleb.

29:49.681 --> 29:52.551
And if you're not happy,
we'll go back.

29:52.767 --> 29:54.926
What if you're happy?

29:55.145 --> 29:58.146
I won't be. Not if you're not.

30:04.362 --> 30:07.197
"If you need anything, just scream"?

30:08.074 --> 30:09.652
What?

30:10.160 --> 30:13.529
Didn't it seem like
a weird thing for that guy to say?

30:14.372 --> 30:18.619
I don't know, it's the same as,
"If you need anything, just yell."

30:18.877 --> 30:21.332
Scream is different.

30:21.546 --> 30:23.954
You're over-thinking again.

30:30.889 --> 30:32.798
Sexy.

30:50.700 --> 30:52.325
What is that?

30:54.162 --> 30:55.787
I don't know.

30:58.166 --> 30:59.826
Shit!

31:04.714 --> 31:06.374
There's nobody out there.

31:10.720 --> 31:12.927
- Shit!
- Caleb, wait!

31:13.515 --> 31:15.922
Fuck! Caleb!

31:16.142 --> 31:18.301
Caleb, open the door, man. Shit!

31:19.020 --> 31:20.514
What the hell are you doing?

31:20.730 --> 31:23.815
Counting the broken bones in my hand.
What's the matter with you?

31:24.025 --> 31:27.477
I gave you the whole big warning knock
and everything. Shit!

31:27.946 --> 31:30.947
- We didn't know who it was.
- Well, who else would it be, man?

31:31.282 --> 31:34.817
Man, I think you gave me
a concussion too. Don't touch.

31:35.036 --> 31:38.619
- How did you get in there?
- There was an open window in the back.

31:38.832 --> 31:40.575
So you just decided to crawl in?

31:40.792 --> 31:43.912
It's not like there was anybody else
in there. Saves me the price.

31:44.462 --> 31:47.547
- You're just gonna sleep in there?
- Better than sleeping in here.

31:47.757 --> 31:51.340
I can't get a good night's rest
listening to you two cuddle all night.

31:51.553 --> 31:54.637
I'm gonna take a shower
before he gets us all kicked out.

31:54.889 --> 31:56.300
You do that.

32:00.270 --> 32:03.306
See? What'd I tell you?

32:03.523 --> 32:06.440
She always getting pissed
about something.

32:06.651 --> 32:08.395
I wonder why.

32:09.946 --> 32:14.110
But that's how your life's
gonna be from now on.

32:14.367 --> 32:15.530
God bless you.

32:15.744 --> 32:19.741
Spending 10 hours a day selling rakes
in her old man's hardware store.

32:20.498 --> 32:23.535
And don't forget, dinner with
the in-laws, huh? That'll be fun.

32:23.752 --> 32:27.701
She'll get pissed because you don't
really like Mom's jerky and pinto beans.

32:27.922 --> 32:31.208
Not exactly the dream life
we always talked about, dude.

32:31.426 --> 32:35.424
But, you know, maybe you'll like
turning into Daniel Boone.

32:36.806 --> 32:38.965
Yeah, or just keep hanging out
at Wrigley and getting drunk...

32:39.225 --> 32:41.977
at North Side bars until we're 50.

32:42.187 --> 32:45.971
We're about to go in and that son
of a bitch started banging on the door.

32:46.191 --> 32:48.895
He must have snuck in the back.

32:49.110 --> 32:53.060
We gotta put up some exterior cameras
so this does not happen again.

32:54.324 --> 32:56.566
What do you want to do
with this bunch?

32:56.951 --> 32:58.909
We hold off.

32:59.788 --> 33:02.113
It's just too risky with three.

33:03.333 --> 33:04.792
Where's Smith at?

33:05.001 --> 33:07.872
He's still out there.
He's keeping an eye on things.

33:11.549 --> 33:15.298
- Hey, come on.
- This shit is hard as hell.

33:33.696 --> 33:36.234
Hey. Hey!

33:38.368 --> 33:42.318
Hey. Gordon says
we're a no-go for tonight.

33:42.539 --> 33:43.997
Why?

33:44.207 --> 33:48.205
In case you didn't notice, there's
three of them in there instead of two.

33:49.629 --> 33:52.334
Hey! Hey!

33:53.883 --> 33:55.793
Did you hear me?

33:57.929 --> 34:00.716
Gordon says to call it off.

34:07.230 --> 34:10.895
No, listen to me.
Gordon calls the shots around here.

34:11.109 --> 34:14.228
I don't need anyone
to tell me how to do this.

34:21.870 --> 34:24.408
Try to get a non-smoking room.

34:27.792 --> 34:29.748
How are you, sir?

34:30.335 --> 34:31.746
It's a long day of driving?

34:31.963 --> 34:37.503
Very. My wife and I are looking for
a soft bed if you got one.

34:37.719 --> 34:39.960
Afraid we don't. Not tonight.

34:40.972 --> 34:44.922
We're doing a little maintenance
on the place. Sort of like a remodel.

34:45.143 --> 34:46.721
Really?

34:47.603 --> 34:52.942
You might wanna turn that off, then.
Save folks the trouble.

34:53.150 --> 34:56.601
That's totally my fault.
I'll get to that soon enough.

34:56.821 --> 34:59.443
You know,
there's the Alpine Motor Lodge...

34:59.657 --> 35:02.409
just down the road.
It's about a 20-minute drive.

35:02.994 --> 35:08.534
Come on in, I'll call them for you.
See what they got open.

35:34.442 --> 35:37.609
I'm just checking to see if you have any
rooms available tonight.

35:37.862 --> 35:41.942
- Non-smoking.
- Oh, and no smoking if possible.

35:46.871 --> 35:48.531
I'm so sorry for the inconvenience.

35:48.915 --> 35:52.664
Well, hopefully this other place
will take us in.

36:16.192 --> 36:18.185
Oh, that sounds good.

36:23.199 --> 36:24.824
Lucky I got something for you.

36:25.035 --> 36:27.157
We should be up and ready
in a couple days...

36:27.370 --> 36:31.949
so if you need a place to stay
on your way back, come on by.

36:33.209 --> 36:36.744
I'll give you our special room
for half off.

36:36.963 --> 36:39.086
Why aren't we staying here?

36:43.511 --> 36:45.504
I already found another place.

36:59.110 --> 37:01.897
What in the hell were you two doing?

37:02.113 --> 37:04.735
He wouldn't listen to me.
I told him you called it off.

37:04.991 --> 37:06.106
He was gonna kill them.

37:06.326 --> 37:09.909
When I say a plan has changed,
the plan has changed.

37:10.163 --> 37:12.239
- What's the fucking difference?
- All...!

37:12.457 --> 37:14.533
All it takes is for one to get away.

37:14.751 --> 37:16.744
Now, no one's going anywhere.

37:17.003 --> 37:19.541
But if you're getting
a little squeamish...

37:20.256 --> 37:21.799
just say so.

37:41.694 --> 37:43.901
- Get out.
- That's all I can...

37:44.155 --> 37:45.863
I'm kind of tired.

37:47.701 --> 37:50.536
Well, I guess back to my free room.

37:52.831 --> 37:54.622
Better hope nobody
walks in over there.

37:54.833 --> 37:57.406
Not unless it's the
Squirrel Creek Community College...

37:57.627 --> 38:00.118
cheerleading bus showing up.

38:01.172 --> 38:03.331
All right. Good night, Tanner.

38:03.550 --> 38:05.341
I really don't like him,
you know that?

38:05.552 --> 38:07.877
Why didn't you
say something earlier?

38:08.722 --> 38:11.639
It's just one more day, okay?

38:12.767 --> 38:14.345
Come on.

38:15.145 --> 38:17.600
Are you sure you're tired?

39:03.943 --> 39:05.853
Not funny.

39:49.531 --> 39:51.570
- Jesus!
- What the hell you doing, man?

39:51.825 --> 39:54.066
Normally I wouldn't stop
a good porno flick.

39:54.285 --> 39:56.574
- Can you please get out?
- I'm the good guy, okay?

39:56.788 --> 39:58.827
Listen to me, all right?

39:59.040 --> 40:01.875
I'm not the only one
watching you two.

40:02.127 --> 40:03.751
- What?
- What are you talking about?

40:03.962 --> 40:05.670
Caleb, come here. Come here, man.

40:07.340 --> 40:09.796
- Look at this.
- What is this?

40:10.009 --> 40:12.927
I don't know, but it sure as hell
ain't pay-per-view.

40:13.138 --> 40:15.344
Caleb, what are you doing?

40:19.728 --> 40:21.138
He's watching us.

40:21.354 --> 40:23.477
What? Who's watching us?

40:23.690 --> 40:25.647
- And that's that.
- Who's watching us?

40:25.859 --> 40:27.234
The guy up in the office.

40:27.444 --> 40:29.567
He's got cameras all over this room.

40:29.779 --> 40:31.986
- Are you serious?
- Yes, he is, darling.

40:32.198 --> 40:35.235
If we're gonna do this,
you better get there before they bolt.

40:36.119 --> 40:37.399
Let's do this fast.

40:37.620 --> 40:39.578
- We go in and out, yeah?
- Hold on.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.328
Look how scared she looks.

40:44.294 --> 40:46.666
- I like watching them squirm.
- They'll take off.

40:46.921 --> 40:49.080
No, we won't let them,
but Smith's right.

40:50.633 --> 40:53.800
We shouldn't be
in such a hurry to finish.

40:54.012 --> 40:56.218
Let's play with them for a while.

40:58.475 --> 40:59.755
What the hell are you doing?

41:01.644 --> 41:03.388
Wanna scare them?

41:03.605 --> 41:05.265
Let's scare them.

41:12.072 --> 41:13.649
How do you know he's watching us?

41:17.535 --> 41:20.739
I saw your ass, but once I knew
it was yours, I stopped looking.

41:20.955 --> 41:23.660
I turned it off almost immediately.

41:26.669 --> 41:28.579
I knew I'd find you two together.

41:28.838 --> 41:32.503
If I hadn't, Elsa, I might have gone on
playing it your way.

41:32.717 --> 41:35.173
There's nothing on here.

41:35.428 --> 41:38.762
It might be one of those perv joints
where you can check in...

41:38.973 --> 41:40.931
and watch the action
in the other room.

41:41.976 --> 41:45.428
- I'm going over to kick that fucker's ass.
- No, the dude's watching us.

41:45.647 --> 41:47.723
He knows we found the cameras.

41:47.941 --> 41:50.266
You go there, the dude's
waiting with a shotgun...

41:50.485 --> 41:52.276
and some fucking K-Y Jelly.

41:52.529 --> 41:54.237
We call the cops and wait for them.

41:54.447 --> 41:56.938
Dude, the sheriff's probably
his cousin or something.

41:57.200 --> 41:59.406
Call the cops, they show up,
we get corn-holed.

41:59.619 --> 42:02.075
Fuck that idea, let's just go.

42:02.580 --> 42:04.158
We're leaving, right?

42:11.381 --> 42:13.587
- Assholes!
- Caleb, let's just go.

42:13.800 --> 42:17.418
Dude, like always, your beautiful
fiancÃ©e's dead-on. Come on, dude.

42:17.679 --> 42:19.506
Caleb, get in the car.

42:19.723 --> 42:21.181
- Now!
- Come on, dude.

42:26.896 --> 42:28.604
Shit.

42:30.066 --> 42:32.023
I'm telling the cops
soon as we get back.

42:32.277 --> 42:35.397
Whatever, man,
let's just get the hell out of here.

42:40.243 --> 42:42.781
- What?
- You've got to be kidding me.

42:43.038 --> 42:44.080
Fuck.

42:44.247 --> 42:46.820
- You leave the light on or something?
- No.

42:49.127 --> 42:52.496
Great. You gonna go ask Norman Bates
for a jump or should I?

42:53.089 --> 42:56.043
I know I didn't leave
the lights on, okay?

42:58.219 --> 42:59.879
What the fuck is that?

43:00.597 --> 43:03.052
They're headlights. It's a truck.

43:04.392 --> 43:07.678
- Shit. Come on, Tanner. Come with me.
- What are you doing?

43:10.815 --> 43:14.065
- Fuck!
- Caleb, get back inside. Get back.

43:15.862 --> 43:17.938
Go out the other side!
Go, go, go! Go!

43:19.157 --> 43:20.948
Shit!

43:24.746 --> 43:26.026
I'm calling the cops, man.

43:28.041 --> 43:29.749
Oh, my God!

43:33.004 --> 43:35.922
Damn! I can't get a signal!
Shit, this is not funny anymore.

43:36.132 --> 43:39.382
Oh, my God. What is he doing?

43:39.594 --> 43:42.381
Can you all scream
a little louder for me?

43:42.639 --> 43:43.837
I'll fucking kill you!

43:44.057 --> 43:46.346
I seriously doubt that, Caleb.

43:46.768 --> 43:49.389
- Fuck!
- Where is he going?

43:49.604 --> 43:51.146
Maybe to get a better view.

43:51.398 --> 43:53.889
- A better fucking view of what?
- Where is he going?

43:54.109 --> 43:55.354
Oh, shit!

43:57.737 --> 43:59.896
- We have to get out.
- Where are we gonna go?

44:04.160 --> 44:05.868
- Fuck!
- Hey!

44:08.540 --> 44:09.785
Go, go!

44:18.174 --> 44:21.793
Come on. Come on. Come here.

44:22.053 --> 44:25.303
This has gone way past some porn
video. What the fuck is happening?

44:25.515 --> 44:28.469
- They tried to kill us.
- They could have if they wanted to.

44:28.727 --> 44:31.514
- They're just trying to scare us.
- No.

44:32.063 --> 44:34.934
They're not just trying to scare us.
This is more than that.

44:35.191 --> 44:38.525
They wouldn't go through that
if they planned on letting us walk.

44:40.363 --> 44:43.150
Oh, my God. He said your name.

44:43.408 --> 44:45.282
What? What?

44:46.286 --> 44:48.859
You didn't say your name
when we checked in.

44:49.080 --> 44:50.907
Oh, my God.

44:52.083 --> 44:53.827
They can hear us.

44:57.088 --> 45:00.422
All right, you guys.
You guys, come on. Come on.

45:00.675 --> 45:02.086
Tanner, grab the door.

45:06.639 --> 45:08.383
All right, so, what else did we say?

45:08.600 --> 45:11.969
Who gives a shit? It's not like there's
gonna be a pop quiz at the end.

45:12.228 --> 45:14.351
We told him that we were
coming from Chicago.

45:14.564 --> 45:15.844
We're on our way to Beulah.

45:17.484 --> 45:20.438
He knows we don't know anybody here,
or where to run for help.

45:20.653 --> 45:23.441
Caleb, it doesn't matter where we run,
let's just run.

45:25.492 --> 45:28.196
- I need to get to the trailer.
- Fuck that. Let's just go.

45:28.953 --> 45:31.326
Jessica's right.
They're not gonna let us run out.

45:31.539 --> 45:34.576
Yeah, but they're not gonna
just let us sit in here either.

45:35.251 --> 45:36.746
We need something to fight with.

45:36.961 --> 45:39.417
There's a bunch of stuff
in the back of the trailer.

45:39.672 --> 45:41.630
There's kitchen stuff, knives, tools...

45:41.841 --> 45:45.542
No, no, no. I like our chances
better if we just run.

45:51.518 --> 45:53.759
How did you say
you got in here again?

45:54.229 --> 45:56.767
There was an open window
in the bathroom.

45:56.981 --> 45:58.606
But you told us that in our room.

46:00.151 --> 46:02.191
They must have heard you.

46:02.862 --> 46:07.323
Maybe not. It's worth a shot anyway.
Come on.

46:07.534 --> 46:09.325
Let's go.

46:12.997 --> 46:14.741
You guys stay.

46:34.519 --> 46:36.559
All right, Tanner.
You go first, then Jess.

46:36.771 --> 46:38.598
We don't know
what's out there, man.

46:38.815 --> 46:42.433
We know what's gonna be in here
in a second. Now, let's go. Come on.

46:43.987 --> 46:45.362
Careful.

47:02.464 --> 47:03.922
Easy does it. Easy does it.

47:04.132 --> 47:05.543
No!

47:07.093 --> 47:09.252
Run, Jess!

47:09.512 --> 47:10.793
No! Caleb!

47:12.098 --> 47:14.257
Caleb! Caleb!

47:14.517 --> 47:16.309
- We have to go back!
- You can't!

47:16.519 --> 47:17.764
- They'll grab you too!
- No!

47:17.979 --> 47:19.022
Come on. Come on.

47:20.398 --> 47:22.557
- Hold him.
- No! Caleb!

47:22.776 --> 47:24.436
- Tie him. Tie him.
- No!

47:24.694 --> 47:25.737
Where'd they take him?

47:29.115 --> 47:32.152
Caleb! Caleb!

47:32.410 --> 47:35.032
- Caleb!
- What about them?

47:35.246 --> 47:37.951
They won't run. Not yet anyway.

47:38.166 --> 47:41.701
- Caleb! Caleb!
- Not while he's still alive.

47:41.961 --> 47:43.705
Jess!

47:46.800 --> 47:47.914
Caleb!

47:48.176 --> 47:51.592
No! Caleb!

47:51.846 --> 47:55.381
- How many do you see?
- I don't know. I think there's two. Caleb!

47:55.600 --> 47:57.509
- What are they doing?
- Stay here.

47:57.769 --> 47:59.263
Keep banging. Keep banging.

47:59.479 --> 48:02.100
- Where are you going?
- They'll think we're both here.

48:02.357 --> 48:03.400
Caleb!

48:09.322 --> 48:12.074
No!

48:12.283 --> 48:13.528
No!

48:17.038 --> 48:19.031
No! They're killing him!

48:37.350 --> 48:41.051
- Caleb! Caleb!
- Oh, my God.

48:41.312 --> 48:42.807
No!

48:44.232 --> 48:46.723
- They're out here.
- Come on! Come on!

48:47.569 --> 48:49.396
Don't let them
make it out of the trees.

48:54.117 --> 48:56.442
And make sure to get it on camera!

49:11.801 --> 49:14.553
- No. I can't do this.
- No, they'll kill you. Come on.

49:14.763 --> 49:16.886
We have to go back for him.
He would go back.

49:17.098 --> 49:20.384
Listen. Listen to me.
We cannot go back, okay?

49:20.602 --> 49:22.559
We just have to get to the cops.

49:22.812 --> 49:24.223
You see anything?

49:24.439 --> 49:25.767
Oh, shit. Come on.

49:31.863 --> 49:35.232
What was that? I heard something.

49:43.249 --> 49:45.159
Okay, let's go.

49:45.835 --> 49:47.627
Shit.

49:52.467 --> 49:54.127
Shit.

49:58.973 --> 50:00.254
Reece!

50:00.475 --> 50:03.310
- Okay. Let's go. Let's go.
- Come on.

50:30.755 --> 50:32.712
Stop moving!

50:34.217 --> 50:38.678
Tanner, Tanner, come on. Come on.
Are you okay? Come on.

51:03.538 --> 51:05.578
Where'd they go?

51:05.790 --> 51:08.079
Where did they go?

51:09.919 --> 51:12.126
Oh, Jesus Christ.

51:12.338 --> 51:14.711
I told you we should've waited.

51:14.924 --> 51:17.760
The chase is half the fun.

51:21.014 --> 51:24.015
We're gonna go this way.
You take the road.

51:24.267 --> 51:25.975
No, no, no. I know these woods.

51:26.186 --> 51:27.644
- Me and Reece...
- Take the road.

51:27.854 --> 51:30.060
You, move. Let's go.

51:31.900 --> 51:33.275
Come on!

51:43.870 --> 51:45.150
What are you doing?

51:45.789 --> 51:49.122
Maybe we should just hide
until daylight.

51:49.376 --> 51:52.045
- See where we're going.
- No, I am not waiting here.

51:52.295 --> 51:54.869
There'll be cars in the morning.
Somebody will help us.

51:55.090 --> 51:57.711
I don't care. I'm not waiting here
while Caleb is there.

51:57.967 --> 52:00.293
- Caleb is dead, okay?
- Fuck you!

52:00.512 --> 52:02.220
You don't know that.

52:03.765 --> 52:05.307
You don't know that.

52:08.478 --> 52:11.099
Yes, I do know that.

52:11.314 --> 52:13.354
And you know too.

52:17.153 --> 52:18.316
I'm sorry.

52:23.618 --> 52:26.323
Let's just keep going, okay?

52:27.789 --> 52:30.624
Let's keep going. Let's go.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.792
Let's keep going.

52:53.481 --> 52:55.972
Over there. Over there.

53:03.074 --> 53:06.028
- Somebody!
- Hello?

53:06.244 --> 53:08.486
Hello? Please help us.

53:08.705 --> 53:10.744
- Over here.
- Hello?

53:10.957 --> 53:14.207
- Somebody?
- Please.

53:14.419 --> 53:16.079
Hello?

53:17.881 --> 53:19.375
Hey, Tanner! Tanner.

53:22.052 --> 53:25.052
- We need your help.
- What do you think you're doing?

53:25.263 --> 53:27.090
- Men were trying to kill us.
- What men?

53:27.307 --> 53:29.346
One of them works at the motel.
Meadow View.

53:29.559 --> 53:31.468
The Meadow View?
Why would they do that?

53:31.686 --> 53:34.521
- We don't know why the fuck...
- You watch your mouth, son.

53:34.731 --> 53:38.266
- You are disturbing a Christian home.
- Sorry, there's somebody out here...

53:38.485 --> 53:41.106
No. No, no, listen.
No, listen, he's sorry, okay?

53:41.362 --> 53:43.320
We need to use your phone
to call police.

53:43.531 --> 53:45.820
Like we're gonna let strangers
into our house.

53:46.034 --> 53:47.825
- How stupid do you think we are?
- Otis.

53:48.078 --> 53:50.948
For all we know, this is an act
to get in here and rob us.

53:51.206 --> 53:52.949
We don't give a fuck about
the shit in your house.

53:53.166 --> 53:54.791
Be quiet, okay? Be quiet. Listen.

53:55.043 --> 53:59.254
You could call them yourselves.
Please, just call the police. Okay?

54:01.174 --> 54:03.380
All right, but you go on
and get off the porch.

54:03.635 --> 54:05.544
Okay. Okay.

54:07.180 --> 54:09.588
- Hillbilly.
- Don't say anything else, okay, please?

54:09.808 --> 54:11.599
They could turn off
the damn spotlight.

54:11.810 --> 54:14.217
Okay, just shut up. Come here.

54:22.821 --> 54:24.647
- Shit.
- Oh, God.

54:28.284 --> 54:30.443
You two. Hey, hey.

54:30.662 --> 54:33.995
Why don't you wait inside
until the sheriff comes?

54:39.546 --> 54:42.297
Doris, what the hell are you doing?

54:42.507 --> 54:44.500
Jesus would let these two in here.

54:44.718 --> 54:47.387
But he knows if they slit his throat,
he'd be back.

54:47.595 --> 54:50.466
- Otis, that is blasphemy.
- And this here is crazy.

54:50.682 --> 54:53.967
Oh, I don't know what you're
worried about. You're trifling.

54:54.185 --> 54:57.186
Honey, why don't you come in the back
and have some coffee?

54:57.397 --> 55:01.395
- No, it's okay.
- Nonsense. Come on.

55:05.655 --> 55:09.071
Let's go, son. Come on.

55:13.830 --> 55:16.368
How much longer do you think?

55:16.583 --> 55:19.288
Don't know. We're a long ways out.

55:19.502 --> 55:22.124
Time enough to tell me
what brought you two our way.

55:22.380 --> 55:25.547
- We told you, the guys from the motel...
- I was asking her.

55:32.766 --> 55:35.932
We were on our way to Beulah,
that's where I'm from.

55:36.186 --> 55:38.855
Lot of good people in Beulah.
What's your family's name?

55:39.105 --> 55:42.023
- Pruitt.
- Not Jack and Sarah Pruitt?

55:43.401 --> 55:45.773
Sounds like the sheriff.

55:47.614 --> 55:51.943
- What if it's not?
- Oh, I'm sure it is. Otis, go get him.

55:55.038 --> 55:58.738
There's nothing to worry about, honey.
Not anymore.

56:07.926 --> 56:09.835
Christ, what's taking them
so long, huh?

56:10.053 --> 56:13.303
They're probably talking about
what happened, that's all. Otis.

56:13.556 --> 56:15.181
Bring them back here, Otis.

56:15.392 --> 56:17.468
There's been a change.
Gordon'll take them.

56:17.685 --> 56:19.061
- No!
- That's fucking them!

56:19.270 --> 56:23.517
- The guys we were telling you about!
- I appreciate you calling me, Otis.

56:23.775 --> 56:25.353
These are the two who robbed us.

56:25.568 --> 56:28.238
What? No, he's lying!
They're the ones that killed Caleb!

56:28.446 --> 56:30.071
Hold on, now. Who's he?

56:30.281 --> 56:33.567
- Christ, can we just do this?
- He just... He works for me, Doris.

56:33.785 --> 56:37.368
Is that right? Why don't you tell me
what it is you say they stole?

56:37.580 --> 56:39.703
What's it matter?
Gordon said they robbed him.

56:39.916 --> 56:41.458
I take his word over strangers.

56:41.710 --> 56:43.583
That fella there,
he's a stranger to me.

56:43.795 --> 56:46.037
Call the sheriff. Call him, Otis.

56:46.256 --> 56:47.880
Gordon.

56:48.091 --> 56:49.965
You know what?
You guys held him for us.

56:50.218 --> 56:52.045
That's more than enough. We'll take...

56:52.512 --> 56:55.548
- We don't have time for this shit.
- Now, Otis.

56:55.807 --> 56:57.681
No! Shit! No!

56:58.601 --> 57:01.602
- What the hell are you doing?!
- Cleaning up my mess.

57:01.855 --> 57:03.515
No!

57:03.857 --> 57:06.145
Otis trusts me.

57:06.359 --> 57:08.103
She would've called the sheriff.

57:08.319 --> 57:10.893
- Let's run.
- Where do you think you're going?

57:11.156 --> 57:13.279
He shot twice.
He doesn't have any shells.

57:15.118 --> 57:16.493
Go! Go! Get them!

57:20.415 --> 57:21.826
No!

57:28.673 --> 57:30.832
No! No!

57:31.092 --> 57:32.421
No!

57:34.304 --> 57:35.846
No!

57:37.182 --> 57:39.886
No! No!

58:04.000 --> 58:05.198
Do it. Shit.

58:10.423 --> 58:13.377
We need to find a phone.
Look for a phone, Jessica.

58:13.593 --> 58:15.384
There's no phone!

58:19.224 --> 58:21.097
There's a car, there's a car!

58:23.478 --> 58:24.723
Go, go, go!

58:37.701 --> 58:39.243
Jessica, come on!

58:40.662 --> 58:43.069
Come on. Come on.
It's right over here. Come on.

58:49.504 --> 58:52.173
No, no. Shit! Fuck!

58:54.509 --> 58:56.502
Tanner, look out! No!

58:59.264 --> 59:00.592
- I got them!
- No!

59:00.849 --> 59:03.933
- I got them!
- Get off me!

59:07.689 --> 59:09.480
Start filming.

59:14.821 --> 59:16.730
Please!

59:16.948 --> 59:18.323
They'll find those bodies...

59:18.575 --> 59:21.860
so let's make sure
they don't find anything of ours.

59:22.078 --> 59:25.946
Go on. Go on. Make it look like
a fucked-up burglary. Go on!

59:26.583 --> 59:27.828
Here. Give me that.

59:32.338 --> 59:33.537
Move.

59:34.340 --> 59:35.965
Move!

59:36.176 --> 59:37.753
Go!

59:48.605 --> 59:53.397
This movie making shit
is a lot harder than it looks.

59:56.071 --> 59:57.648
Please.

01:00:03.870 --> 01:00:05.198
I can't breathe.

01:00:28.645 --> 01:00:30.056
What happened?

01:00:30.271 --> 01:00:32.394
He murdered them both.

01:00:33.608 --> 01:00:35.601
What are we gonna do, Gordon?

01:00:37.237 --> 01:00:38.861
Go!

01:00:55.422 --> 01:00:58.173
- Haul his ass to the truck.
- No.

01:00:58.383 --> 01:01:00.292
I'll take care of her. Come on.

01:01:02.846 --> 01:01:05.171
No, no, no!

01:01:50.935 --> 01:01:53.177
No!

01:01:53.855 --> 01:01:57.769
No! No!

01:01:57.984 --> 01:02:01.270
- No!
- Well, time to go back to work.

01:02:05.617 --> 01:02:07.775
Are you sitting this one out too?

01:02:10.538 --> 01:02:14.322
You've done the rest on your own.
Might as well make it a clean sweep.

01:02:15.668 --> 01:02:18.456
Well, it makes me wonder
what I need you two for.

01:02:22.759 --> 01:02:24.882
Let's have some fun.

01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:33.847
I don't like this anymore, Gordon.

01:02:35.730 --> 01:02:37.438
What are we gonna do?

01:02:37.649 --> 01:02:39.060
No!

01:02:41.611 --> 01:02:44.280
No!

01:02:44.489 --> 01:02:45.734
No!

01:02:59.421 --> 01:03:01.793
We'll just let it play out.

01:03:02.257 --> 01:03:05.092
I mean, he's the only one
who's killed anyone tonight.

01:03:05.301 --> 01:03:08.836
We'll wait till the time's right
and we'll pin the whole thing on him.

01:03:10.056 --> 01:03:12.843
- What are you two talking about?
- Nothing.

01:03:13.977 --> 01:03:17.844
Not that either of you
have got the balls to use it.

01:03:18.356 --> 01:03:21.974
If you start getting a brave feeling...

01:03:23.236 --> 01:03:25.561
I'd be real careful.

01:03:41.546 --> 01:03:43.373
You enjoy your nap?

01:03:45.633 --> 01:03:48.800
Why, you looked like
a little angel sleeping there.

01:03:52.098 --> 01:03:55.265
I'm gonna try something
a little different this time.

01:04:01.858 --> 01:04:06.271
Unless you can
convince me different.

01:04:14.245 --> 01:04:16.534
Wait, wait, wait.

01:04:35.683 --> 01:04:39.183
You remind me of a girl
I picked up in Tulsa.

01:04:39.396 --> 01:04:42.065
Or Little Rock. I can't remember.

01:04:44.442 --> 01:04:46.933
Wish I got to know her better.

01:04:49.906 --> 01:04:52.278
She had the damnedest scream.

01:04:53.368 --> 01:04:55.277
Almost made my ears bleed.

01:05:02.335 --> 01:05:04.909
I wonder what you sound like.

01:05:14.806 --> 01:05:16.680
Get over there!

01:05:19.894 --> 01:05:21.472
You bitch!

01:05:21.688 --> 01:05:24.143
- Shit!
- Get in here, you fucking bitch!

01:05:47.505 --> 01:05:48.964
Fuck!

01:05:49.174 --> 01:05:50.917
Fuck!

01:05:52.385 --> 01:05:55.303
Fuck. Fuck.

01:05:55.513 --> 01:05:56.972
Get her! Get the fucking gun!

01:05:58.850 --> 01:06:00.926
- Maybe we should...
- Go get her!

01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:30.004
Where is she?

01:06:31.341 --> 01:06:33.084
Find her.

01:06:33.343 --> 01:06:35.217
Find her!

01:07:40.368 --> 01:07:41.827
Caleb.

01:07:45.081 --> 01:07:46.741
Caleb.

01:07:48.293 --> 01:07:49.668
Caleb.

01:08:24.578 --> 01:08:26.037
You have to be quiet.

01:08:31.586 --> 01:08:33.328
Jessica.

01:08:38.301 --> 01:08:41.006
Just keep looking up here, okay?

01:10:35.126 --> 01:10:36.704
Tanner.

01:10:38.838 --> 01:10:40.380
Tanner.

01:11:34.894 --> 01:11:36.305
Shit.

01:12:09.512 --> 01:12:11.256
Shit.

01:14:37.702 --> 01:14:39.362
Reece!

01:15:20.995 --> 01:15:23.368
Stupid asshole.

01:15:25.083 --> 01:15:26.743
Reece!

01:16:45.497 --> 01:16:46.695
Hello, angel.

01:17:02.055 --> 01:17:03.514
No!

01:17:06.059 --> 01:17:07.221
No!

01:17:08.144 --> 01:17:10.516
No! No!

01:17:29.374 --> 01:17:31.165
Shit!

01:17:31.793 --> 01:17:34.284
Back off! No!

01:17:34.546 --> 01:17:37.381
No! No!

01:18:03.742 --> 01:18:05.319
Shit!

01:18:25.555 --> 01:18:27.678
Please. Stop.

01:18:30.602 --> 01:18:31.644
Please stop!

01:19:10.141 --> 01:19:12.846
Sheriff, somebody tore the shit
out of this place.

01:19:13.061 --> 01:19:16.346
- Well, she said there were cameras.
- They're not here anymore.

01:19:16.564 --> 01:19:19.731
Yeah, no bodies either.
You get a hold of the owner?

01:19:20.235 --> 01:19:21.943
Yeah. Lives in Florida.

01:19:22.153 --> 01:19:25.403
Says Gordon Jenks
runs the business for him.

01:19:25.615 --> 01:19:29.565
I know Gordon.
Seems decent enough.

01:19:29.786 --> 01:19:33.451
Not if you buy the girl's story.
Do you?

01:19:33.665 --> 01:19:36.286
All I'm buying
is some folks are dead.

01:19:37.919 --> 01:19:41.620
Sure would make it easier if we could
find out what happened to her friends.

01:19:57.939 --> 01:19:59.314
So how many do you want?

01:19:59.524 --> 01:20:01.232
As many as you can make me.

01:20:01.443 --> 01:20:03.898
I'll start burning some copies.

01:20:05.113 --> 01:20:08.030
How long before
you can have a new one?

01:20:08.241 --> 01:20:09.819
A few weeks.

01:20:10.577 --> 01:20:13.780
Just as soon
as I get the place fixed up...

01:20:13.997 --> 01:20:16.155
put the cameras in...

01:20:17.292 --> 01:20:19.249
we'll be open for business.

01:20:19.461 --> 01:20:21.204
All right.
