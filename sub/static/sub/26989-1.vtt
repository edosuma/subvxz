00:19.958 --> 00:23.520
(wind whistling)

00:23.520 --> 00:24.848
- [The Soothsayer] It seems to me,

00:24.848 --> 00:28.610
that when God conceived the world;

00:28.610 --> 00:29.893
that was poetry.

00:32.037 --> 00:34.538
(tense music)

00:38.870 --> 00:42.017
He formed it; that was sculpture.

00:43.080 --> 00:45.330
(drumming)

00:55.579 --> 00:57.829
(crashing)

01:03.228 --> 01:05.895
(birds calling)

01:42.890 --> 01:46.727
He varied and colored it,
and that was painting.

01:46.727 --> 01:49.394
(waves washing)

01:55.205 --> 01:57.955
(wind whistling)

02:12.420 --> 02:17.420
And then, crowning all, he
peopled it with living beings,

02:28.359 --> 02:32.580
and that was the beginning
of the grand divine,

02:32.580 --> 02:36.460
eternal drama.
(dramatic music)

02:36.460 --> 02:38.610
Dr. Thomas Edward Poag.

02:44.997 --> 02:48.914
(speaking in foreign language)

03:22.642 --> 03:25.467
(explosion booms)

03:25.467 --> 03:28.550
(hitting and firing)

03:31.396 --> 03:35.151
(nuclear explosion whooshing)

03:35.151 --> 03:40.068
(tense music)
(vocalizing)

03:43.565 --> 03:46.482
(flames crackling)

04:11.951 --> 04:14.701
(wind whistling)

04:20.812 --> 04:24.729
(suspenseful percussive music)

04:39.029 --> 04:41.803
- [Crowd] Caesar, Caesar, Caesar!

04:41.803 --> 04:43.720
Caesar, Caesar, Caesar!

04:45.186 --> 04:47.103
Caesar, Caesar, Caesar!

04:48.718 --> 04:50.635
Caesar, Caesar, Caesar!

04:52.384 --> 04:54.301
Caesar, Caesar, Caesar!

04:55.800 --> 04:57.717
Caesar, Caesar, Caesar!

04:58.600 --> 05:02.249
(shouting)
Caesar, Caesar, Caesar!

05:02.249 --> 05:07.249
- Hence, home, you idle
creatures, get you home!

05:07.660 --> 05:09.040
Is this a holiday?

05:09.040 --> 05:10.520
What?
(laughing)

05:10.520 --> 05:13.640
Know you not, being
mechanical, you ought not walk

05:13.640 --> 05:16.410
upon a laboring day without
the sign of your profession?

05:16.410 --> 05:18.920
Speak, what trade art thou?

05:18.920 --> 05:22.660
- Why, sir, a carpenter.

05:22.660 --> 05:25.280
- Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?

05:25.280 --> 05:27.280
What dost thou with thy best apparel on?

05:29.450 --> 05:33.170
You, sir; what trade are you?

05:33.170 --> 05:35.160
- Truly, sir, in respect of a fine

05:35.160 --> 05:38.700
workman, I am but, as
you would say, a cobbler.

05:38.700 --> 05:40.000
- But what trade art thou?

05:41.090 --> 05:42.420
Answer me directly.

05:42.420 --> 05:43.840
- A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may

05:43.840 --> 05:46.330
use with a safe conscience, sir, which is

05:46.330 --> 05:49.684
indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.

05:49.684 --> 05:50.517
(murmuring)

05:50.517 --> 05:51.350
- What trade, thou knave?

05:51.350 --> 05:53.190
Thou naughty knave, what trade?

05:53.190 --> 05:54.970
- Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out

05:54.970 --> 05:59.970
with me; yet, if you be
out, sir, I can mend you.

06:00.573 --> 06:02.590
(murmuring)

06:02.590 --> 06:04.760
- What mean'st thou by that?

06:04.760 --> 06:05.743
Mend me?

06:06.650 --> 06:08.500
Thou saucy fellow!

06:08.500 --> 06:10.593
- Why, sir, cobble you.

06:11.610 --> 06:14.140
- Thou art a cobbler, art thou?

06:14.140 --> 06:18.560
- Truly, ma'am, all that
I live by is with the awl;

06:18.560 --> 06:21.310
I meddle with no tradesman's
matters, nor women's

06:21.310 --> 06:23.660
matters, but with awl.

06:23.660 --> 06:27.430
I am indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes;

06:27.430 --> 06:31.770
when they are in great
danger, I re-cover them.

06:31.770 --> 06:35.250
- But wherefore art not in thy shop today?

06:35.250 --> 06:37.310
Why dost thou lead these
men about the streets?

06:37.310 --> 06:39.050
- Truly, ma'am, to wear out their shoes

06:39.050 --> 06:40.690
to get myself into more work.

06:40.690 --> 06:43.640
- Yeah!
(laughing)

06:43.640 --> 06:46.490
But indeed, ma'am, we make holiday to

06:46.490 --> 06:50.764
see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.

06:50.764 --> 06:53.014
(chanting)

06:54.610 --> 06:55.533
- Wherefore rejoice?

06:57.560 --> 06:59.433
What conquest brings he home?

07:01.570 --> 07:06.570
You blocks, you stones, you
worse than senseless things!

07:11.031 --> 07:13.165
(laughing)

07:13.165 --> 07:14.065
(groans)
Be gone!

07:15.110 --> 07:18.170
- Go, go, good countrymen.

07:18.170 --> 07:20.693
Go, go.

07:23.031 --> 07:25.281
(laughing)

07:27.700 --> 07:30.390
See whether their basest
metal be not moved;

07:30.390 --> 07:32.630
they vanish tongue-tied
in their guiltiness.

07:33.900 --> 07:35.970
Go you down that way towards the capitol;

07:35.970 --> 07:37.900
this way will I.

07:37.900 --> 07:39.010
Disrobe the images

07:39.010 --> 07:41.360
where you find them
deck'd with ceremonies.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.193
- May we do so?

07:42.193 --> 07:43.788
You know it is the feast of Lupercal.

07:43.788 --> 07:44.621
- It is no matter;

07:44.621 --> 07:46.803
let no images be hung
with Caesar's trophies.

07:47.750 --> 07:50.130
I'll about and drive away
the vulgar from the streets;

07:50.130 --> 07:52.860
so do you too, where
you perceive them thick.

07:52.860 --> 07:55.370
These growing feathers
pluck'd from Caesar's

07:55.370 --> 07:57.660
wing will make him fly an ordinary pitch,

07:57.660 --> 07:59.320
who else would soar above the view of men,

07:59.320 --> 08:01.523
and keep us all in servile fearfulness.

08:02.473 --> 08:05.140
(upbeat music)

08:05.140 --> 08:08.473
(shouting and cheering)

08:24.847 --> 08:25.783
- Calpurnia--

08:25.783 --> 08:26.770
- Peace, ho!

08:26.770 --> 08:27.827
Caesar speaks.

08:27.827 --> 08:28.660
- Calpurnia--

08:28.660 --> 08:29.493
- Here, my lord.

08:29.493 --> 08:34.159
- Stand you in Antonius' way
when he doth run his course.

08:34.159 --> 08:34.993
Antonius.

08:36.520 --> 08:37.753
- Caesar, my lord?

08:40.250 --> 08:42.840
- Forget not in your speed, Antonius,

08:42.840 --> 08:47.540
to touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,

08:47.540 --> 08:51.130
the barren, touched in this holy chase,

08:51.130 --> 08:52.933
shake off their sterile curse.

08:54.830 --> 08:56.510
- I shall remember.

08:56.510 --> 08:58.873
When Caesar says do this it is performed.

09:01.990 --> 09:06.084
- Set on, and leave no ceremony out!

09:06.084 --> 09:11.084
(cheering and applauding)
(upbeat music)

09:15.166 --> 09:15.999
- Caesar!

09:26.340 --> 09:27.611
- Hark, who calls?

09:27.611 --> 09:29.240
- Bid every noise be still.

09:29.240 --> 09:30.803
Peace yet again!

09:31.730 --> 09:34.023
- Who is it in the press that calls on me?

09:36.172 --> 09:39.377
I hear a tongue, shriller than
all the music, cry Caesar!

09:41.010 --> 09:45.013
Speak, Caesar is turn'd to hear.

09:46.810 --> 09:48.763
- Beware the Ides of March.

09:49.814 --> 09:50.647
- What woman is that?

09:50.647 --> 09:55.180
- A soothsayer bids you
beware the Ides of March.

09:55.180 --> 09:57.840
- Set her before me; let me see her face.

09:57.840 --> 10:02.363
- Woman, come from the
throng; look upon Caesar.

10:12.466 --> 10:15.220
- What say'st thou to me now?

10:15.220 --> 10:16.333
Speak once again.

10:17.444 --> 10:19.944
(tense music)

10:22.190 --> 10:24.293
- Beware the Ides of March.

10:29.255 --> 10:31.672
(laughs)

10:31.672 --> 10:34.755
- She is a dreamer; let us leave her.

10:36.630 --> 10:37.897
Pass.

10:37.897 --> 10:40.480
(upbeat music)

10:48.170 --> 10:50.670
(tense music)

11:20.321 --> 11:22.781
- Will you go see the order of the chase?

11:22.781 --> 11:24.060
- Not I.

11:24.060 --> 11:25.013
- I pray you, do.

11:25.916 --> 11:29.250
- I am not gamesome; I do lack some

11:29.250 --> 11:31.883
part of that quick
spirit that is in Antony.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.613
Let me not hinder, Cassius,
your desires; I'll leave you.

11:40.090 --> 11:44.493
- Brutus, I do observe you now of late.

11:45.950 --> 11:47.380
I have not from your eyes that

11:47.380 --> 11:51.000
gentleness and show of
love as I was wont to have.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.610
You bear too stubborn and
too strange a hand over your

11:53.610 --> 11:55.250
friend that loves you.

11:55.250 --> 11:57.390
- Cassius, be not deceived.

11:57.390 --> 11:59.980
If I have veil'd my
look, I turn the trouble

11:59.980 --> 12:02.163
of my countenance merely upon myself.

12:03.290 --> 12:07.530
Vexed I am of late with
passions of some difference,

12:07.530 --> 12:10.710
conceptions only proper
to myself, which give some

12:10.710 --> 12:12.853
soil perhaps to my behaviors;

12:14.030 --> 12:16.580
but let not therefore my
good friends be grieved,

12:16.580 --> 12:19.130
among which number, Cassius, be you one,

12:19.130 --> 12:21.020
nor construe any further my neglect,

12:21.020 --> 12:23.220
than that poor Brutus, with himself

12:23.220 --> 12:25.573
at war, forgets the shows
of love to other men.

12:26.547 --> 12:28.559
- Then, Brutus, I have
much mistook your passion;

12:28.559 --> 12:30.040
(crowd cheering and shouting)

12:30.040 --> 12:33.060
by means whereof this breast
of mine hath buried thoughts

12:33.060 --> 12:38.060
of great value, worthy cogitations.

12:40.110 --> 12:43.323
Tell me, good Brutus,
can you see your face?

12:44.300 --> 12:46.570
- No, Cassius, for the eye sees not

12:46.570 --> 12:48.960
itself but by reflection,
by some other thing.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.920
- Aye 'tis just.

12:50.920 --> 12:53.810
And it is very much lamented,
Brutus, that you have no

12:53.810 --> 12:56.770
such mirrors as will turn your hidden

12:56.770 --> 13:00.263
worthiness into your eye, that
you might see your shadow.

13:01.720 --> 13:06.720
I have heard where many of
the best respect in Rome,

13:07.130 --> 13:10.750
except immortal Caesar.

13:10.750 --> 13:13.700
Speaking of Brutus,
and groaning underneath

13:13.700 --> 13:18.700
this age's yoke, have wish'd
that noble Brutus had his eyes.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.590
- Into what dangers would
you lead me, Cassius,

13:28.590 --> 13:29.840
that you would have me seek into

13:29.840 --> 13:31.673
myself for that which is not in me?

13:34.280 --> 13:38.333
- Good Brutus, be prepared to hear;

13:39.280 --> 13:40.490
and since you know you cannot

13:40.490 --> 13:42.570
see yourself so well as by reflection,

13:42.570 --> 13:47.510
I, your glass, will modestly discover

13:47.510 --> 13:52.093
to yourself that of yourself
which you yet know not of.

13:53.058 --> 13:54.633
(shouting)

13:54.633 --> 13:55.983
- What means this shouting?

13:57.830 --> 14:00.923
I do believe the people
choose Caesar for their king.

14:03.030 --> 14:04.333
- Aye, do you fear it?

14:05.730 --> 14:10.200
Then must I think you
would not have it so.

14:10.200 --> 14:11.833
- I would not, Cassius.

14:13.860 --> 14:14.993
Yet I love him well.

14:17.370 --> 14:19.993
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?

14:21.140 --> 14:23.090
What is it that you would impart to me?

14:24.463 --> 14:25.690
That be ought toward the general good

14:25.690 --> 14:27.340
set honor in one eye
and death in the other

14:27.340 --> 14:28.920
and I will look on both indifferently

14:28.920 --> 14:32.510
for let the gods so speed
me as I love the name honor

14:32.510 --> 14:33.910
more than I fear death.

14:33.910 --> 14:35.490
- I know that virtue to be in you,

14:35.490 --> 14:38.083
Brutus, as well as I do
know your outward favor.

14:39.100 --> 14:44.100
Well, honor is the subject of my story.

14:47.730 --> 14:52.730
I cannot tell what you and
other men think of this life;

14:52.730 --> 14:56.420
but, for my single self, I had as lief

14:56.420 --> 15:00.523
not be as live to be in awe
of such a thing as I myself.

15:02.175 --> 15:04.125
I was born free as Caesar; so were you.

15:05.693 --> 15:08.470
We both have fed as well;
and we can both endure

15:08.470 --> 15:10.770
the winter's cold as well as he.

15:10.770 --> 15:13.420
He had a fever when he was in Spain;

15:13.420 --> 15:18.212
and when the fit was on him
I did mark how he did shake,

15:18.212 --> 15:22.980
'tis true, 'tis true, this god did shake.

15:22.980 --> 15:25.870
As colored lips did from their color fly.

15:25.870 --> 15:28.880
And that same eye whose
bend doth awe the world

15:28.880 --> 15:31.260
did lose his luster.

15:31.260 --> 15:33.020
I did hear him groan.

15:33.020 --> 15:36.540
Aye, and that tongue of
his that bade the Romans

15:36.540 --> 15:39.400
mark him, and write his
speeches in their books,

15:39.400 --> 15:42.830
alas, it cried, "Give me
some drink, Titinius,"

15:42.830 --> 15:45.503
as a sick girl.

15:46.529 --> 15:47.829
Ye gods, it doth amaze me,

15:48.788 --> 15:50.300
a man of such a feeble temper should

15:50.300 --> 15:54.003
so get the start of the majestic world,

15:55.643 --> 15:57.684
and bear the palm alone.

15:57.684 --> 15:59.070
(shouting)

15:59.070 --> 16:00.563
- Another general shout!

16:02.108 --> 16:03.410
I do believe that these
applauses are for some

16:03.410 --> 16:05.400
new honors that are heap'd on Caesar.

16:05.400 --> 16:08.250
- Why, man, (laughs) he
doth bestride the narrow

16:08.250 --> 16:11.630
world like a Colossus; and we petty men

16:11.630 --> 16:14.500
walk under his huge legs and peep

16:14.500 --> 16:17.720
about to find ourselves
dishonorable graves.

16:17.720 --> 16:20.640
Men at some time are
masters of their fates.

16:20.640 --> 16:24.150
The fault, dear Brutus,
is not in our stars,

16:24.150 --> 16:28.263
but in ourselves that we are underlings.

16:29.730 --> 16:34.030
Brutus and Caesar, what
should be in that Caesar?

16:34.030 --> 16:37.390
Why should that name be
sounded more than yours?

16:37.390 --> 16:39.910
Write them together,
yours is as fair a name;

16:39.910 --> 16:42.070
sound them, it doth
become the mouth as well;

16:42.070 --> 16:44.780
weigh them, it is as
heavy; conjure with them,

16:44.780 --> 16:47.673
Brutus will start a
spirit as soon as Caesar.

16:47.673 --> 16:48.960
Now, in the names of

16:48.960 --> 16:52.310
all the gods at once, upon what meat

16:52.310 --> 16:55.763
doth this our Caesar feed
that he is grown so great?

16:57.850 --> 17:00.576
When could they say, til now, that

17:00.576 --> 17:04.410
talk'd of Rome, that her wide
walls encompass'd but one man?

17:04.410 --> 17:07.210
Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough,

17:07.210 --> 17:09.792
when there is in it but one only man.

17:11.460 --> 17:13.720
O, you and I have heard our fathers say

17:13.720 --> 17:16.165
there was a Brutus once that would

17:16.165 --> 17:19.970
have brook'd th' eternal devil
to keep his state in Rome,

17:19.970 --> 17:21.060
aye as easily...

17:23.640 --> 17:26.260
As easily as a king!

17:27.689 --> 17:31.080
- That you do love me,
I am nothing jealous;

17:31.080 --> 17:33.423
what you would work me
to, I have some aim.

17:34.900 --> 17:37.190
How I have thought of this,
and of these times, I shall

17:37.190 --> 17:38.690
recount hereafter; for this present,

17:38.690 --> 17:41.010
I would not, so with love I might

17:41.010 --> 17:43.530
entreat you, be any further moved.

17:43.530 --> 17:46.280
What you have said, I will consider;

17:46.280 --> 17:49.380
what you have to say, I will with

17:49.380 --> 17:51.040
patience hear; and find a time both

17:51.040 --> 17:53.380
meet to hear and answer such high things.

17:53.380 --> 17:56.240
Until then, my noble
friend, chew upon this.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.930
Brutus had rather be a villager
than to repute himself a

17:58.930 --> 18:01.450
son of Rome under these
hard conditions as this

18:01.450 --> 18:03.063
time is like to lay upon us.

18:06.504 --> 18:08.407
- I am glad that my weak words have

18:09.380 --> 18:12.533
struck but thus much
show of fire from Brutus.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.744
(cheering and applauding)

18:16.744 --> 18:20.775
- The games are done, and Caesar returns

18:20.775 --> 18:22.319
- As they pass by, pluck
Casca by the sleeve;

18:22.319 --> 18:24.630
and he will, after his sour fashion,

18:24.630 --> 18:28.090
tell you what hath
proceeded worthy note today.

18:28.090 --> 18:28.923
- I will do so.

18:30.171 --> 18:33.171
(suspenseful music)

19:04.001 --> 19:05.200
- [Casca] Did you pull me by the cloak?

19:05.200 --> 19:07.150
Would you speak with me?
- Aye, Casca.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.270
Tell us what hath chanced today,

19:09.270 --> 19:10.643
that Caesar looks so sad.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.490
- Why, you were with him, were you not?

19:13.490 --> 19:16.293
- I should not then ask
Casca what had chanced.

19:18.260 --> 19:20.303
- Why, there was a crown offer'd him;

19:21.265 --> 19:22.098
and being offer'd him, he put it by

19:22.098 --> 19:24.558
with the back of his hand, thus; and

19:24.558 --> 19:25.840
then the people fell a-shouting.

19:25.840 --> 19:27.848
- What was the second noise for?

19:27.848 --> 19:28.681
- Why, for that too.

19:28.681 --> 19:29.514
- They shouted thrice.

19:29.514 --> 19:30.900
What was the last cry for?

19:30.900 --> 19:31.770
- Why, for that too.

19:31.770 --> 19:34.030
- Was the crown offer'd him thrice?

19:34.030 --> 19:36.620
- Aye, marry, was't, and he put it by

19:36.620 --> 19:39.610
thrice, every time gentler than other;

19:39.610 --> 19:42.230
and at every putting-by mine
honest neighbors shouted.

19:42.230 --> 19:43.700
- Who offer'd him the crown?

19:43.700 --> 19:44.970
- Why, Antony.

19:44.970 --> 19:47.404
- Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.

19:47.404 --> 19:49.460
- I can as well be hang'd,
as tell the manner of it.

19:49.460 --> 19:51.410
It was mere foolery; I did not mark it.

19:58.570 --> 20:01.980
I saw Mark Antony offer him
a crown; yet 'twas not a

20:01.980 --> 20:04.795
crown neither, 'twas
one of these coronets;

20:04.795 --> 20:05.628
(tense music)

20:05.628 --> 20:07.610
and, as I told you, he put it by once.

20:07.610 --> 20:09.593
But, for all that, to my thinking,

20:10.910 --> 20:12.210
he would fain have had it.

20:13.120 --> 20:14.720
Then he offered it to him again.

20:16.199 --> 20:17.323
Then he put it by again.

20:18.236 --> 20:20.557
But, to my thinking, he was very loath to

20:20.557 --> 20:21.963
lay his fingers off it.

20:23.899 --> 20:25.220
And then he offered it
the third time; he put it

20:25.220 --> 20:27.590
the third time by; and still, as he

20:27.590 --> 20:29.610
refused it, the rabblement shouted,

20:29.610 --> 20:31.350
and clapp'd their chopt hands, and

20:31.350 --> 20:32.870
threw up their sweaty night-caps,

20:32.870 --> 20:34.450
and uttered such a deal of stinking

20:34.450 --> 20:36.810
breath because Caesar refused the crown,

20:36.810 --> 20:38.277
that it had almost choked Caesar,

20:38.277 --> 20:40.313
for he swooned and fell down at it.

20:41.625 --> 20:42.458
And for mine own part, I durst

20:42.458 --> 20:43.430
not laugh for fear of opening my

20:43.430 --> 20:44.442
lips and receiving the bad air.

20:44.442 --> 20:45.275
- But, soft!

20:45.275 --> 20:46.108
I pray you.

20:46.108 --> 20:48.720
What, did Caesar swoon?

20:48.720 --> 20:50.795
- He fell down in the market-place,

20:50.795 --> 20:53.620
and foam'd at mouth, and was speechless.

20:53.620 --> 20:54.654
- 'Tis very like.

20:54.654 --> 20:55.550
He hath the falling sickness.

20:55.550 --> 20:58.454
- No, Caesar hath it not; but you, and

20:58.454 --> 21:03.043
I, and honest Casca, we
have the falling sickness.

21:06.541 --> 21:07.374
- I know not what you mean by that;

21:07.374 --> 21:09.360
but I am sure Caesar fell down.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.040
- What said he when he came unto himself?

21:11.040 --> 21:13.210
- Marry, before he fell down, when he

21:13.210 --> 21:14.910
perceived the common herd was glad

21:14.910 --> 21:17.420
he refused the crown, he pluck'd me

21:17.420 --> 21:19.160
ope his doublet, and offered them

21:19.160 --> 21:23.430
his throat to cut, and I had
been a many of any occupation

21:23.430 --> 21:25.950
if I would not have taken him at a word,

21:25.950 --> 21:28.150
I would I might go to
hell among the rogues.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.410
So he fell, when he came to himself again

21:32.410 --> 21:34.740
he said if he had done
or said anything amiss,

21:34.740 --> 21:35.930
he desired their worships

21:35.930 --> 21:37.310
to think it was his infirmity.

21:37.310 --> 21:38.510
- Did Cicero say anything?

21:38.510 --> 21:40.193
- Aye, he spoke Greek.

21:40.193 --> 21:41.310
(blows raspberry)

21:41.310 --> 21:42.880
- To what effect?

21:42.880 --> 21:43.713
- Man I tell you that

21:43.713 --> 21:45.810
I'll never look you in the face again?

21:45.810 --> 21:47.812
But those that understood him

21:47.812 --> 21:49.360
smiled at one another
and shook their heads.

21:49.360 --> 21:51.713
But for mine own part it was Greek to me.

21:54.410 --> 21:55.243
Fare you well.

21:58.180 --> 21:59.593
There was more foolery yet,

22:00.470 --> 22:02.101
if I could remember it.

22:02.101 --> 22:03.480
- Will you sup wit me tonight, Casca?

22:03.480 --> 22:04.580
- No, I am promised forth.

22:04.580 --> 22:06.230
- Will you dine with me tomorrow?

22:07.169 --> 22:10.090
- Aye, if I be alive, and your mind

22:10.090 --> 22:13.410
hold, and your dinner worth the eating.

22:13.410 --> 22:16.150
- Good; I will expect you.

22:16.150 --> 22:19.083
- Do so; farewell both.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.500
- What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!

22:27.690 --> 22:29.500
He was quick mettle
when he went to school.

22:29.500 --> 22:33.980
- So is he now in execution of
any bold or noble enterprise,

22:33.980 --> 22:36.493
however he puts on this tardy form.

22:37.710 --> 22:38.843
- And so it is.

22:41.210 --> 22:43.020
For now I will leave you.

22:43.020 --> 22:45.580
Tomorrow, if you please to
speak with me, I will come home

22:45.580 --> 22:47.510
to you; or, if you will,

22:47.510 --> 22:49.850
come home to me, and I will wait for you.

22:49.850 --> 22:50.763
- I will do so.

22:55.550 --> 22:59.443
Til then, think of the world.

23:04.866 --> 23:07.830
Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I

23:07.830 --> 23:09.820
see, thy honorable metal may be

23:09.820 --> 23:12.123
wrought, from that it is disposed.

23:13.240 --> 23:15.110
Therefore 'tis meet that noble minds

23:15.110 --> 23:16.610
keep ever with their likes; for who

23:16.610 --> 23:18.853
so firm that cannot be seduced?

23:20.850 --> 23:23.610
Caesar doth bear me hard, but he

23:23.610 --> 23:25.430
loves Brutus;
(dramatic music)

23:25.430 --> 23:28.043
if I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,

23:29.010 --> 23:30.643
he should not humor me.

23:32.730 --> 23:37.730
I will this night, in several
hands, in at his windows

23:38.420 --> 23:40.030
throw, as if they came from several

23:40.030 --> 23:43.470
citizens, writings all tending to

23:43.470 --> 23:45.730
the great opinion that Rome holds of

23:45.730 --> 23:50.010
his name; wherein obscurely Caesar's

23:50.010 --> 23:51.513
ambition shall be glanced at.

23:52.580 --> 23:56.683
And after this let Caesar seat him sure;

23:58.634 --> 24:02.473
for we will shake him,
or worse days endure.

24:15.997 --> 24:20.997
(thunder rumbling)
(suspenseful music)

24:29.816 --> 24:32.117
Who's there?
- A Roman.

24:32.117 --> 24:34.140
- [Cassius] Casca, by your voice.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.090
- Your ear is good.

24:36.480 --> 24:39.815
Cassius, what night is this!

24:39.815 --> 24:41.953
- A very pleasing night to honest men.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.366
- Who ever knew the heavens menace so?

24:45.366 --> 24:47.260
- Those that have known the
earth so full of faults.

24:47.260 --> 24:49.240
For my part, I have
walk'd about the streets,

24:49.240 --> 24:53.150
submitting me unto the perilous night;

24:53.150 --> 24:55.600
and, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,

24:55.600 --> 24:58.070
have bared my bosom to the thunderstone;

24:58.070 --> 25:00.740
and when the cross blue lightning
seem'd to open the breast

25:00.740 --> 25:03.700
of heaven, I did present myself even

25:03.700 --> 25:05.673
in the aim and very flash of it.

25:07.358 --> 25:09.103
- But wherefore did you
so much tempt the heavens?

25:10.512 --> 25:11.650
It is the part of men to fear and

25:11.650 --> 25:13.210
tremble, when the most mighty gods

25:13.210 --> 25:16.000
by tokens send such dreadful
heralds to astonish us.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.050
- You are dull, Casca;
and those sparks of life

25:20.050 --> 25:21.410
that should be in a Roman you do

25:21.410 --> 25:24.810
want, or else you use not.

25:24.810 --> 25:28.360
You look pale and gaze,
and put on fear and

25:28.360 --> 25:30.720
cast yourself in wonder, to see the

25:30.720 --> 25:33.950
strange impatience of the heavens.

25:33.950 --> 25:37.960
But if you would consider the true

25:37.960 --> 25:42.910
cause why all these fires, why all

25:42.910 --> 25:45.540
these gliding ghosts, why all these

25:45.540 --> 25:47.310
things change from their ordinance,

25:47.310 --> 25:49.816
their natures, and preformed faculties

25:49.816 --> 25:51.713
to monstrous quality.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.750
Why, you shall find that
Heaven hath infused them

25:54.750 --> 25:57.050
with these spirits, to make them

25:57.050 --> 26:02.050
instruments of fear and warning
unto some monstrous state.

26:03.940 --> 26:08.940
Now could I, Casca, name
to thee a man most like

26:10.160 --> 26:15.160
this dreadful night; a man no mightier

26:15.380 --> 26:18.130
than thyself or me in personal action;

26:18.130 --> 26:21.653
yet prodigious grown, and fearful,

26:22.970 --> 26:24.823
as these strange eruptions are.

26:26.361 --> 26:28.705
- 'Tis Caesar that you
mean; is it not, Cassius?

26:28.705 --> 26:29.693
- Let it be who it is.

26:31.045 --> 26:33.530
For Romans now have thews
and limbs like to their

26:33.530 --> 26:37.670
ancestors; but, woe the while!

26:37.670 --> 26:40.498
Our fathers' minds are dead, and we are

26:40.498 --> 26:42.248
govern'd with our mothers' spirits.

26:44.651 --> 26:45.530
- Indeed they say the senators tomorrow

26:45.530 --> 26:47.443
mean to establish Caesar as a king;

26:48.654 --> 26:50.150
and he shall wear his crown by sea

26:50.150 --> 26:52.830
and land, in every place
save here in Italy.

26:52.830 --> 26:55.030
- I know where I will
wear this dagger then;

26:56.180 --> 27:00.910
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.

27:00.910 --> 27:04.032
Therein, ye gods, you
make the weak most strong;

27:04.032 --> 27:05.760
therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat.

27:05.760 --> 27:10.760
For life, being weary
of these worldly bars,

27:10.800 --> 27:13.690
never lacks power to dismiss itself.

27:13.690 --> 27:17.420
If I know this, know all the world

27:17.420 --> 27:20.700
besides, that part of tyranny that I

27:20.700 --> 27:25.490
do bear I can shake off at pleasure.

27:25.490 --> 27:26.323
- So can I.

27:27.540 --> 27:29.460
So every bondman in his own hand

27:29.460 --> 27:32.110
bears the power to cancel his captivity.

27:32.110 --> 27:34.990
- And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?

27:34.990 --> 27:35.823
Poor man!

27:37.533 --> 27:41.840
I know he would not be a wolf,
but that he sees the Romans

27:41.840 --> 27:42.783
are but sheep.

27:43.990 --> 27:48.990
He were no lion, were
not the Romans hinds.

27:49.191 --> 27:50.290
But, O grief.
(laughs)

27:50.290 --> 27:51.463
Where hast thou led me?

27:52.460 --> 27:56.580
I perhaps speak this to a willing bondman.

27:58.217 --> 28:00.460
Then I know my answer must be made;

28:00.460 --> 28:04.143
but I am arm'd, and dangers are to me

28:04.143 --> 28:06.720
(whistles)
indifferent.

28:06.720 --> 28:09.620
- You speak to Casca; and to such a man

28:09.620 --> 28:11.580
that is no fleering tell-tale.

28:11.580 --> 28:13.380
Hold, my hand.

28:13.380 --> 28:14.980
And I will set this foot of mine as

28:14.980 --> 28:16.463
far as who goes farthest.

28:17.800 --> 28:19.050
- There's a bargain made.

28:19.950 --> 28:23.080
Now know you, Casca, I have moved already

28:23.080 --> 28:25.030
some certain of the noblest-minded

28:25.030 --> 28:27.400
Romans to undergo with me

28:27.400 --> 28:32.400
an enterprise of
honorable-dangerous consequence;

28:32.901 --> 28:34.470
(clock bell tolling)

28:34.470 --> 28:38.409
and I do know by this, they
stay for me in Pompey's Porch.

28:38.409 --> 28:41.290
For now, this fearful night, is

28:41.290 --> 28:43.010
favor'd like the work we have in

28:43.010 --> 28:48.010
hand, most bloody, fiery,
and most dangerous.

28:50.950 --> 28:53.562
- Stand close awhile, for
here comes one in haste.

28:53.562 --> 28:55.080
- 'Tis Cinna; I do know her by her gait;

28:55.080 --> 28:55.983
she is a friend.

28:57.101 --> 28:57.934
Cinna, where haste you so?

28:57.934 --> 28:59.714
- To find out you.

28:59.714 --> 29:00.547
Who's that?

29:00.547 --> 29:01.380
Metellus, Cimber?

29:01.380 --> 29:03.640
- No, it is Casca, one
incorporate to our attempts.

29:03.640 --> 29:05.173
Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?

29:05.173 --> 29:06.787
- I am glad on't.

29:06.787 --> 29:08.700
What a fearful night is this!

29:08.700 --> 29:10.590
- Am I not stay'd for?

29:10.590 --> 29:11.770
Tell me.

29:11.770 --> 29:13.247
- Yes, you are.

29:14.593 --> 29:16.160
O Cassius, if you could but win

29:16.160 --> 29:17.600
the noble Brutus to our party--

29:17.600 --> 29:19.080
- Be you content.

29:19.080 --> 29:24.080
Good Cinna, take this paper,
and look you lay it in

29:24.407 --> 29:26.009
the praetor's chair, where Brutus

29:26.009 --> 29:27.450
may but find it; and throw this

29:27.450 --> 29:29.280
in at his window; set this up with

29:29.280 --> 29:31.170
wax upon old Brutus' statue.

29:31.170 --> 29:33.230
All this done, repair to Pompey's Porch,

29:33.230 --> 29:34.503
where you shall find us.

29:35.410 --> 29:37.480
Is Decius, Brutus, and Trebonius there?

29:37.480 --> 29:38.900
- All but Metellus Cimber, and he's

29:38.900 --> 29:40.650
gone to seek you at your house.

29:40.650 --> 29:43.760
Well, I will hie and so bestow
these papers as you bade me.

29:43.760 --> 29:47.373
- That done, repair to Pompey's theater.

29:50.320 --> 29:52.250
Come, Casca, you and I will yet, ere

29:52.250 --> 29:54.240
day, see Brutus at his house.

29:54.240 --> 29:55.963
Three parts of him is ours already;

29:55.963 --> 29:58.660
and the man entire,
upon the next encounter,

29:58.660 --> 30:00.476
yields him ours.
(dramatic music)

30:00.476 --> 30:02.423
- O, he sits high in
all the people's hearts!

30:03.490 --> 30:04.970
And that which would appear offense in us,

30:04.970 --> 30:08.020
his countenance, like richest
alchemy, will change to virtue

30:08.020 --> 30:08.853
and to worthiness.

30:08.853 --> 30:10.360
- Him, and his worth, and our great

30:10.360 --> 30:12.757
need of him, you have
right well conceited.

30:12.757 --> 30:16.090
Let us go, for it is after
midnight; and, ere day,

30:16.090 --> 30:19.377
we will awake him, and be sure of him.

30:31.534 --> 30:34.451
(thunder rumbling)

30:49.351 --> 30:50.934
- What, Lucius, ho!

30:56.470 --> 30:58.470
I cannot, by the progress of the stars,

30:58.470 --> 30:59.973
give guess how near to day.

31:01.890 --> 31:03.653
Lucius, I say!

31:06.170 --> 31:08.523
I would it were my fault
to sleep so soundly.

31:12.060 --> 31:13.930
When, Lucius, when!

31:13.930 --> 31:15.530
Awake, I say!

31:15.530 --> 31:16.363
What, Lucius!

31:17.301 --> 31:18.620
- Call'd you, my lord?

31:18.620 --> 31:20.940
- Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.

31:20.940 --> 31:23.790
When it is lighted, come and call me here.

31:23.790 --> 31:24.730
- I will, my lord.

31:42.260 --> 31:46.063
- It must be by his death.

31:49.690 --> 31:54.330
And, for my part, I know
no personal cause to

31:54.330 --> 31:57.453
spurn at him, but for the general.

31:59.170 --> 32:00.490
He would be crown'd.

32:02.490 --> 32:05.793
How that might change his
nature, there's the question.

32:08.640 --> 32:11.010
It is the bright day that
brings forth the adder;

32:11.010 --> 32:13.160
and that craves wary walking.

32:13.160 --> 32:14.477
Crown him?

32:14.477 --> 32:16.320
That, and then, I grant,
we put a sting in him,

32:16.320 --> 32:18.453
that at his will he may do danger with.

32:23.167 --> 32:25.766
Th' abuse of greatness is, when it

32:25.766 --> 32:30.766
disjoins remorse from power;
and, to speak truth of Caesar,

32:31.670 --> 32:33.310
I have not known when his affections

32:33.310 --> 32:34.993
sway'd more than his reason.

32:36.560 --> 32:39.699
But 'tis a common proof, that lowliness

32:39.699 --> 32:42.160
is young ambition's ladder, whereto

32:42.160 --> 32:45.330
the climber-upward turns his face;

32:45.330 --> 32:47.590
but, when he once attains the upmost

32:47.590 --> 32:50.100
round, he then unto the ladder turns

32:50.100 --> 32:52.340
his back, looks in the clouds,

32:52.340 --> 32:55.941
scorning the base degrees
by which he did ascend.

32:55.941 --> 32:59.993
So Caesar may; fashion it thus,
that what he is, augmented,

33:05.870 --> 33:07.810
would run to these and these extremities.

33:07.810 --> 33:10.880
And therefore think him as a serpent's egg

33:12.120 --> 33:14.563
and kill him in the shell.

33:17.573 --> 33:19.450
- The taper burneth in your closet, sir.

33:19.450 --> 33:21.410
Searching the window for a flint

33:21.410 --> 33:23.767
I found this letter thus seal'd up,

33:23.767 --> 33:27.143
and I am sure it did not lie
there when I went to bed.

33:28.190 --> 33:31.073
- Get you to bed again; it is not day.

33:31.970 --> 33:36.410
Is not tomorrow, boy, the Ides of March?

33:36.410 --> 33:37.793
- I know not, sir.

33:38.790 --> 33:42.130
- Look in the calendar, and bring me word.

33:42.130 --> 33:43.280
- [Lucius] I will, sir.

33:44.600 --> 33:47.517
(thunder rumbling)

34:14.083 --> 34:14.917
- The exhalations, whizzing in the air

34:14.917 --> 34:17.010
give so much light that
I may read by them.

34:24.030 --> 34:25.143
Brutus, thou sleep'st.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.603
Awake and see thyself.

34:29.790 --> 34:31.612
Shall Rome et cetera?

34:34.420 --> 34:36.853
Speak, strike, redress!

34:39.070 --> 34:40.663
Brutus, thou sleep'st.

34:41.560 --> 34:43.263
Shall Rome, et cetera?

34:47.610 --> 34:49.092
Thus must I piece it out.

34:50.480 --> 34:54.373
Shall Rome stand under one man's awe?

34:55.947 --> 34:56.864
Rome, what?

35:00.610 --> 35:03.640
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome

35:03.640 --> 35:06.580
the Tarquin drive, when
he was call'd a king.

35:06.580 --> 35:11.323
Speak, strike, redress!

35:12.430 --> 35:14.530
Am I entreated, then, to speak and strike?

35:16.890 --> 35:21.250
O Rome, I make thee
promise, if the redress will

35:21.250 --> 35:23.650
follow, thou receivest thy full

35:23.650 --> 35:26.773
petition at the hand of Brutus!

35:29.320 --> 35:32.220
- March has wasted 15 days, sir.

35:32.220 --> 35:33.053
- 'Tis good.

35:34.341 --> 35:36.650
(knocking)

35:36.650 --> 35:39.263
Go to the door, somebody knocks.

35:41.300 --> 35:42.790
Since Cassius first did whet me

35:42.790 --> 35:45.853
against Caesar I have not slept.

35:47.500 --> 35:48.950
Between the acting of a dreadful

35:48.950 --> 35:50.183
thing and the first motion, all the

35:50.183 --> 35:53.853
interim is like a phantasma
or a hideous dream.

35:55.390 --> 35:57.810
The genius and the mortal
instruments are then in council;

35:57.810 --> 36:00.854
and the state of man, like to
a little kingdom, suffers then

36:00.854 --> 36:03.563
the nature of an insurrection.

36:05.987 --> 36:07.740
- Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at

36:07.740 --> 36:09.913
the door, who doth desire to see you.

36:11.095 --> 36:14.220
- Is he alone?
- No, there are more with him.

36:14.220 --> 36:15.460
- Do you know them?

36:15.460 --> 36:17.740
- No, sir, their hats are pluck'd against

36:17.740 --> 36:19.580
their ears, and half their faces

36:19.580 --> 36:21.560
are buried in their cloaks,

36:21.560 --> 36:24.900
that by no means I may discover them.

36:24.900 --> 36:25.793
- Let 'em enter.

36:28.350 --> 36:29.400
They are the faction.

36:30.720 --> 36:34.020
O conspiracy, shamest
thou to show thy dangerous

36:34.020 --> 36:36.950
brow by night, when evils are most free?

36:36.950 --> 36:39.900
O, then, by day where wilt
thou find a cavern dark enough

36:39.900 --> 36:42.393
to mask thy monstrous visage?

36:44.330 --> 36:49.330
Seek none, conspiracy; hide
it in smiles and affability.

37:09.389 --> 37:13.308
- I think we are too bold upon your rest.

37:13.308 --> 37:15.493
Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?

37:17.760 --> 37:20.063
- I have been up this
hour, awake all night.

37:21.390 --> 37:24.253
Know I this lot that come along with you?

37:24.253 --> 37:25.740
- Yes, every one of them; and no one here

37:25.740 --> 37:28.130
ut honors you; and every one

37:28.130 --> 37:29.730
doth wish you had but that opinion

37:29.730 --> 37:32.473
of yourself which every
noble Roman bears of you.

37:34.730 --> 37:36.570
This is Trebonius.

37:36.570 --> 37:37.853
- He is welcome hither.

37:39.696 --> 37:40.746
- This Decius Brutus.

37:42.899 --> 37:43.899
- He is welcome too.

37:45.912 --> 37:50.912
- This, Casca; this, Cinna;
and this, Metellus Cimber.

37:54.210 --> 37:56.033
- They are all welcome.

37:57.890 --> 37:59.840
What watchful cares interpose

37:59.840 --> 38:02.283
themselves betwixt your eyes and night?

38:06.020 --> 38:10.383
Hmm, give me your hands
all over, one by one.

38:14.802 --> 38:16.040
- And let us swear our resolution.

38:16.040 --> 38:18.433
- No, not an oath.

38:20.180 --> 38:24.253
If not the face of men, the
sufferance of our souls,

38:25.200 --> 38:27.660
the time's abuse.
(tense music)

38:27.660 --> 38:30.334
If these be motives weak, break off

38:30.334 --> 38:33.270
betimes, and every one
hence to their idle bed;

38:33.270 --> 38:35.820
so let high-sighted tyranny range on,

38:35.820 --> 38:37.923
'til each man drop by lottery.

38:38.790 --> 38:40.810
What need we any spur but our own cause

38:40.810 --> 38:42.840
to prick us to redress?

38:42.840 --> 38:44.730
What other oath than honesty to

38:44.730 --> 38:47.280
honesty engaged, that this shall be,

38:47.280 --> 38:48.893
or we will fall for it?

38:50.677 --> 38:52.620
But do not stain the even virtue of our

38:52.620 --> 38:54.170
enterprise, nor th' insuppressive

38:54.170 --> 38:56.170
mettle of our spirits, to think that

38:56.170 --> 38:59.120
or our cause or our
performance did need an oath.

38:59.120 --> 39:01.670
- Shall no man else be
touch'd but only Caesar?

39:01.670 --> 39:03.543
- Only Caesar.
- Decius, well urged.

39:04.880 --> 39:09.880
I think it is not meet,
Mark Antony, so well beloved

39:11.010 --> 39:14.010
of Caesar, should outlive Caesar.

39:14.010 --> 39:15.843
We shall find of him a shrewd contriver;

39:15.843 --> 39:20.403
and you know his means,
if he improve them,

39:20.403 --> 39:23.713
may well stretch so
far as to annoy us all.

39:24.560 --> 39:29.440
Which to prevent, let Antony
and Caesar fall together.

39:29.440 --> 39:31.480
- Our course will seem too bloody,

39:31.480 --> 39:34.310
Caius Cassius, to cut the head off,

39:34.310 --> 39:35.730
and then hack the limbs, for Antony

39:35.730 --> 39:37.140
is but a limb of Caesar.

39:37.140 --> 39:40.070
Let us be sacrificers,
but not butchers, Caius.

39:40.070 --> 39:44.330
- Yet I do fear him; for in
th' ingrafted love he bears

39:44.330 --> 39:45.163
to Caesar--

39:45.163 --> 39:47.780
- No, no, there is no fear in him;

39:47.780 --> 39:49.860
let him not die; for he will live,

39:49.860 --> 39:51.702
and laugh at this hereafter.

39:51.702 --> 39:52.700
(clock bell tolling)

39:52.700 --> 39:53.950
- Peace, count the clock.

39:57.500 --> 39:59.322
- The clock hath stricken three.

39:59.322 --> 40:00.710
(thunder rumbling)

40:00.710 --> 40:02.830
- 'Tis time to part.
- But it is doubtful yet

40:02.830 --> 40:06.040
whether Caesar will
come forth today or no;

40:06.040 --> 40:08.850
for he is superstitious grown of late.

40:08.850 --> 40:11.390
It may be the persuasion of his oracles

40:12.357 --> 40:14.110
may hold him from the capitol today.

40:14.110 --> 40:15.810
- Never fear that.

40:15.810 --> 40:18.790
If he be so resolved, I can o'ersway him.

40:18.790 --> 40:22.290
Let me work; for I can
give his humor the true

40:22.290 --> 40:25.124
bent, and I will bring him to the capitol.

40:25.124 --> 40:26.840
- Nay, we will all of us
be there to fetch him.

40:26.840 --> 40:29.940
- By the eighth hour,
is that the uttermost?

40:29.940 --> 40:32.420
- Be that the uttermost; and fail not.

40:32.420 --> 40:33.550
- The morning comes upon 's.

40:33.550 --> 40:38.483
We'll leave you, Brutus; and,
friends, disperse yourselves,

40:39.410 --> 40:41.493
but all remember what you have said,

40:43.430 --> 40:45.253
and show yourselves true Romans.

40:46.980 --> 40:50.350
- My good comrades,
look fresh and merrily;

40:50.350 --> 40:52.610
let not our looks put on our purposes,

40:52.610 --> 40:54.580
but bear it as our Roman actors do,

40:54.580 --> 40:57.343
with untired spirits and formal constancy.

40:58.780 --> 41:02.057
And so, good morrow, everyone.

41:22.550 --> 41:25.467
(thunder rumbling)

41:31.584 --> 41:32.417
- [Portia] Brutus, my lord!

41:33.310 --> 41:36.610
- Portia, what mean you?

41:36.610 --> 41:38.093
Wherefore rise you now?

41:39.200 --> 41:42.902
It is not for your health
thus to commit your weak

41:42.902 --> 41:45.393
condition to the raw-cold morning.

41:46.650 --> 41:48.023
- Nor for yours neither.

41:49.310 --> 41:53.423
You've ungently, Brutus,
stole from my bed,

41:54.670 --> 41:56.060
and yesternight, at supper,

41:56.060 --> 41:59.163
you suddenly arose, and walk'd about,

42:00.170 --> 42:02.180
musing and sighing, with your arms across;

42:02.180 --> 42:03.390
and, when I ask'd you what the matter was,

42:03.390 --> 42:05.593
you stared upon me with ungentle looks.

42:07.297 --> 42:10.483
It will not let you eat,
nor talk, nor sleep;

42:12.360 --> 42:13.910
and, could it work so much upon your shape

42:13.910 --> 42:15.350
as it hath much prevail'd on your

42:15.350 --> 42:20.350
condition, I should not know you, Brutus.

42:23.770 --> 42:27.113
Good my lord, make me acquainted
with your cause of grief.

42:28.802 --> 42:32.053
- I am not well in
health, and that is all.

42:33.220 --> 42:35.230
- Brutus is wise, and, were he not in

42:35.230 --> 42:37.280
health, he would embrace
the means to come by it.

42:37.280 --> 42:39.565
- Why, so I do.

42:39.565 --> 42:42.070
Gentle Portia, go to bed.

42:42.070 --> 42:46.360
- No, my Brutus; you have some sick

42:46.360 --> 42:48.530
offense within your mind, which, by

42:48.530 --> 42:50.000
the right and virtue of my place,

42:50.000 --> 42:51.830
I ought to know of.

42:51.830 --> 42:56.830
And, upon my knees, I charge
you, by that great vow

42:57.030 --> 42:58.660
which did incorporate and make us

42:58.660 --> 43:02.050
one, that you unfold to me, yourself,

43:02.050 --> 43:06.033
your half, why you are heavy,

43:07.520 --> 43:09.500
and what men tonight have had resort

43:09.500 --> 43:11.110
to you; for here have been some six

43:11.110 --> 43:14.873
or seven, which did hide their
faces even from darkness.

43:17.542 --> 43:18.892
- Kneel not, gentle Portia.

43:21.060 --> 43:23.410
- I should not need, if
you were gentle Brutus.

43:26.820 --> 43:27.653
(laughs)

43:27.653 --> 43:31.030
Within the bond of
marriage, tell me, Brutus,

43:31.030 --> 43:34.030
is it excepted I should know no secrets

43:34.030 --> 43:35.130
that appertain to you?

43:36.770 --> 43:40.633
Am I yourself but, as it
were, in sort or limitation,

43:42.780 --> 43:46.180
to keep with you at meals, comfort

43:46.180 --> 43:51.180
your bed, and talk to you sometimes?

43:53.750 --> 43:56.200
Dwell I but in the suburbs
of your good pleasure?

43:57.528 --> 44:00.111
If it be no more, Portia is
Brutus' harlot, not his wife.

44:00.111 --> 44:02.500
- You are my true and honorable wife;

44:02.500 --> 44:05.660
as dear to me as are the ruddy drops

44:05.660 --> 44:07.343
that visit my sad heart.

44:08.670 --> 44:11.134
- If this were true, then
should I know this secret.

44:11.134 --> 44:12.640
(tense music)

44:12.640 --> 44:16.760
I grant I am a woman; but
withal a woman that Lord

44:16.760 --> 44:18.703
Brutus took to wife.

44:21.440 --> 44:24.427
Tell me your counsels,
I will not disclose 'em.

44:26.440 --> 44:30.920
I have made strong proof of my constancy,

44:30.920 --> 44:35.253
giving myself a voluntary
wound here in the thigh.

44:39.913 --> 44:43.233
Can I bear that with patience
and not my husband's secrets?

44:47.420 --> 44:52.420
- O ye gods, render me worthy
of this most noble wife!

45:04.266 --> 45:09.266
Portia, go in awhile; and by and by

45:09.500 --> 45:13.573
thy bosom shall partake
the secrets of my heart.

45:15.360 --> 45:20.360
And all my engagements
I will construe to thee.

45:44.585 --> 45:47.585
(suspenseful music)

46:02.494 --> 46:05.411
(thunder rumbling)

46:18.750 --> 46:22.350
- Nor heaven nor earth
have been at peace tonight.

46:22.350 --> 46:25.117
Thrice hath Calpurnia
in her sleep cried out,

46:25.117 --> 46:26.027
"Help, ho!

46:26.027 --> 46:28.230
"They murder Caesar!"

46:28.230 --> 46:31.033
Who's within?
- My lord?

46:32.130 --> 46:33.280
- Go bid the priests do present

46:33.280 --> 46:36.301
sacrifice, and bring me
their opinions of success.

46:36.301 --> 46:37.134
- [Servant] I will, my lord.

46:42.911 --> 46:44.033
- What mean you, Caesar?

46:46.130 --> 46:47.943
Think you to walk forth today?

46:49.560 --> 46:51.540
You shall not stir out
of your house today.

46:51.540 --> 46:52.893
- Caesar shall forth.

46:54.290 --> 46:57.640
The things that threaten me
ne'er look but on my back;

46:57.640 --> 47:00.783
when they shall see the face
of Caesar, they are vanished.

47:06.690 --> 47:10.900
- Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,

47:10.900 --> 47:12.233
yet now they fright me.

47:13.130 --> 47:15.990
There is one within,
besides the things that we

47:15.990 --> 47:17.550
have heard and seen, recounts most

47:17.550 --> 47:20.440
horrid sights seen by the watch.

47:20.440 --> 47:22.760
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;

47:22.760 --> 47:26.110
and graves have yawn'd,
and yielded up their dead.

47:26.110 --> 47:28.270
O Caesar, these things are beyond all use,

47:28.270 --> 47:30.074
and I do fear them!

47:30.074 --> 47:31.010
- What can be avoided whose end

47:31.010 --> 47:32.973
is purposed by the mighty gods?

47:34.294 --> 47:37.120
Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these

47:37.120 --> 47:40.030
predictions are to the world
in general as to Caesar.

47:40.030 --> 47:43.080
- When beggars die,
there are no comets seen;

47:43.080 --> 47:47.252
the heavens themselves blaze
forth the death of princes.

47:47.252 --> 47:50.120
- Cowards die many times
before their deaths;

47:50.120 --> 47:53.373
the valiant never taste of death but once.

47:54.317 --> 47:55.660
(crying)

47:55.660 --> 47:57.963
- My lord?
- What say the oracles?

47:59.239 --> 48:00.950
- They would not have
you to stir forth today.

48:00.950 --> 48:03.944
Plucking the entrails
of an offering forth,

48:03.944 --> 48:06.253
they could not find a
heart within the beast.

48:07.660 --> 48:09.573
- Do not go forth today.

48:10.550 --> 48:13.030
Call it my fear that
keeps you in the house,

48:13.030 --> 48:14.003
and not your own.

48:15.280 --> 48:17.910
Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.

48:26.287 --> 48:28.863
- For thy humor, I will stay at home.

48:37.970 --> 48:40.170
Here's Decius Brutus,
he shall tell them so.

48:42.386 --> 48:43.336
- Caesar, all hail!

48:44.370 --> 48:45.683
Good morrow, worthy Caesar.

48:45.683 --> 48:48.176
I come to fetch you to the Senate-house.

48:48.176 --> 48:49.009
- And you are come in very happy time

48:49.009 --> 48:50.550
to bear my greeting to the Senators,

48:50.550 --> 48:52.600
and tell them that I will not come today.

48:53.600 --> 48:57.860
Cannot, is false; and
that I dare not, falser.

48:57.860 --> 48:59.140
I will not come today.

48:59.140 --> 49:00.913
Tell them so, Decius.

49:00.913 --> 49:01.746
- Say he is sick.

49:01.746 --> 49:02.790
- Shall Caesar send a lie?

49:04.110 --> 49:06.600
Have I in conquest
stretch'd mine arm so far,

49:06.600 --> 49:08.750
to be afeard to tell
grey-beards the truth?

49:10.150 --> 49:12.480
Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.

49:12.480 --> 49:13.820
- Most mighty Caesar, let me know some

49:13.820 --> 49:16.407
cause, lest I be laugh'd
at when I tell them so.

49:16.407 --> 49:21.380
- The cause is in my
will; I will not come.

49:23.150 --> 49:25.793
That is enough to satisfy the Senate.

49:30.569 --> 49:34.160
But, for your private
satisfaction, because I love you,

49:34.160 --> 49:35.213
I will let you know.

49:38.190 --> 49:40.303
Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home.

49:41.290 --> 49:43.690
She dreamt tonight she
saw my statue, which,

49:43.690 --> 49:45.530
like a fountain with an hundred spouts,

49:45.530 --> 49:48.810
did run pure blood; and many lusty Romans

49:48.810 --> 49:51.563
came smiling and did
bathe their hands in it.

49:52.470 --> 49:54.610
And these does she apply for warnings and

49:54.610 --> 49:56.580
portents and evils imminent; and on

49:56.580 --> 49:59.613
her knee hath begg'd that
I will stay at home today.

50:00.510 --> 50:03.150
- This dream is all amiss interpreted.

50:03.150 --> 50:05.460
It was a vision fair and fortunate.

50:05.460 --> 50:07.180
Your statue spouting blood in many

50:07.180 --> 50:09.060
pipes, in which so many smiling Romans

50:09.060 --> 50:11.560
bathed, signifies that from you great

50:11.560 --> 50:14.320
Rome shall suck reviving blood.

50:14.320 --> 50:17.350
This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.

50:17.350 --> 50:19.450
- And this way have you well expounded it.

50:20.440 --> 50:23.163
- I have, when you shall
know all that I have to say.

50:24.900 --> 50:26.610
The Senate have concluded to give this day

50:26.610 --> 50:27.963
a crown to mighty Caesar.

50:29.210 --> 50:31.250
If you shall send them
word you will not come,

50:31.250 --> 50:32.770
their minds may change.

50:32.770 --> 50:35.180
Besides, it were a mock
apt to be render'd, for

50:35.180 --> 50:36.810
someone to say, break up the Senate

50:36.810 --> 50:38.030
til another time, when Caesar's

50:38.030 --> 50:40.053
wife shall meet with better dreams.

50:41.020 --> 50:43.360
Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear

50:43.360 --> 50:45.140
love to your proceeding bids me tell

50:45.140 --> 50:48.130
you this; and reason to my love is liable.

50:48.130 --> 50:51.087
- How foolish do your
fears seem now, Calpurnia!

50:51.087 --> 50:53.450
I am ashamed I did yield to them.

50:53.450 --> 50:55.572
Give me my robe, for I will go.

50:55.572 --> 50:56.405
(crying)

50:56.405 --> 50:59.850
And look where Brutus is come to fetch me.

50:59.850 --> 51:03.543
What, Brutus, are you
stirr'd so early too?

51:04.440 --> 51:06.217
Good morrow, Casca.

51:06.217 --> 51:07.050
What is't o'clock?

51:07.050 --> 51:08.500
- Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.

51:08.500 --> 51:11.450
- I thank you for your pains and courtesy.

51:11.450 --> 51:12.410
See!

51:12.410 --> 51:17.410
Antony, that revels long
o'nights, is notwithstanding up.

51:17.550 --> 51:18.660
Good morrow, Antony.

51:18.660 --> 51:20.423
- So to most noble Caesar.

51:21.480 --> 51:22.377
- Now, Cinna?

51:24.217 --> 51:25.384
Now, Metallus.

51:28.240 --> 51:29.590
What, Trebonius!

51:31.625 --> 51:33.600
I have an hour's talk in store for you.

51:33.600 --> 51:37.110
Remember that you call
on me today; be near me,

51:37.110 --> 51:39.583
that I may remember you.
- Caesar I will.

51:40.850 --> 51:43.050
And so near will I be
that your best friends

51:43.050 --> 51:45.172
shall wish that I were further.

51:45.172 --> 51:46.320
(laughing)

51:46.320 --> 51:51.081
- Good friends, go in and
taste some wine with me

51:51.081 --> 51:56.081
and we, like friends, will
straight way go together.

51:56.087 --> 51:58.587
(tense music)

52:05.557 --> 52:07.300
- That every like is not the

52:07.300 --> 52:12.300
same, O Caesar, the heart of
Brutus yearns to think upon!

52:15.152 --> 52:20.152
(dramatic music)
(applauding)

52:38.158 --> 52:39.492
- Is everyone in place?

52:39.492 --> 52:42.477
- Yes, we're prepared, fail not.

52:42.477 --> 52:45.080
- I wish your enterprise today may thrive.

52:45.080 --> 52:47.290
- What enterprise, Popilius?

52:47.290 --> 52:48.880
- Fare you well.

52:48.880 --> 52:50.690
- What said Popilius Lena?

52:50.690 --> 52:53.223
- He wish'd today our
enterprise might thrive.

52:53.223 --> 52:55.360
I fear our purpose is discovered.

52:55.360 --> 52:57.060
- Look, how he makes to Caesar.

52:57.060 --> 52:58.670
Mark him.

52:58.670 --> 53:01.069
- Casca, be sudden,
for we fear prevention.

53:01.069 --> 53:02.573
Brutus, what shall be done?

53:03.480 --> 53:06.500
If this be known, Cassius or
Caesar never shall turn back,

53:06.500 --> 53:07.760
for I will slay myself.

53:07.760 --> 53:08.800
- Cassius, be constant.

53:08.800 --> 53:10.450
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;

53:10.450 --> 53:12.900
for, look, he smiles, and
Caesar doth not change.

53:13.810 --> 53:15.850
- Trebonius knows his time, for, look

53:15.850 --> 53:18.300
you, Brutus, he draws Mark
Antony out of the way.

53:21.880 --> 53:23.649
- Where is Metellus Cimber?

53:23.649 --> 53:24.780
Let him go, and presently
prefer his suit to Caesar.

53:24.780 --> 53:27.913
- He is address'd; press
near and second him.

53:33.158 --> 53:36.908
- Casca, you are the
first to rear your hand.

53:39.231 --> 53:42.314
(heartbeat thumping)

54:03.516 --> 54:06.016
(gong clangs)

54:30.880 --> 54:32.213
- Are we all ready?

54:34.070 --> 54:39.070
What is now amiss that Caesar
and his Senate must redress?

54:41.350 --> 54:44.290
- Most high, most mighty, and most

54:44.290 --> 54:46.987
puissant Caesar, Metellus Cimber

54:50.170 --> 54:53.942
throws before thy seat an humble heart.

54:53.942 --> 54:55.110
- I must prevent thee, Cimber.

54:56.020 --> 54:59.920
These couchings and these lowly courtesies

54:59.920 --> 55:03.180
might fire the blood of ordinary men,

55:03.180 --> 55:05.600
and turn pre-ordinance and first decree

55:05.600 --> 55:08.112
into the law of children.

55:08.112 --> 55:10.730
Be not fond, to think that Caesar bears

55:10.730 --> 55:13.191
such rebel blood that will be thaw'd

55:13.191 --> 55:14.024
(tense music)

55:14.024 --> 55:16.260
from the true quality with that which

55:16.260 --> 55:21.040
melteth fools; I mean, sweet words,

55:21.040 --> 55:24.113
low-crooked curtsies,
and base spanielfawning.

55:26.050 --> 55:28.780
Thy brother by decree was banished.

55:28.780 --> 55:32.330
If thou dost bend, and
pray, and fawn for him,

55:32.330 --> 55:34.600
I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.

55:34.600 --> 55:37.270
- Caesar, thou dost me wrong.

55:37.270 --> 55:39.410
- Caesar did never wrong but with just

55:39.410 --> 55:42.983
cause, nor without cause
will he be satisfied.

55:44.600 --> 55:45.930
- Is there no voice more worthy than

55:45.930 --> 55:48.380
my own, to sound more sweetly in

55:48.380 --> 55:51.230
great Caesar's ear for the repealing

55:51.230 --> 55:52.620
of my banish'd brother?

55:52.620 --> 55:56.220
- I kiss thy hand, Caesar,
but not in flattery;

55:56.220 --> 55:57.590
desiring thee that Publius

55:57.590 --> 56:00.020
Cimber may have an
immediate freedom of repeal.

56:00.020 --> 56:01.685
- What, Brutus?

56:01.685 --> 56:03.000
- Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.830
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,

56:05.830 --> 56:07.960
to beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.

56:07.960 --> 56:11.683
- I could be well moved, if I were as you;

56:13.750 --> 56:18.333
if I could pray to move,
prayers would move me.

56:19.390 --> 56:23.760
But I am constant as the
northern star, of whose truefix'd

56:23.760 --> 56:26.993
and resting quality there is
no fellow in the firmament.

56:27.920 --> 56:29.750
The skies are painted with unnumber'd

56:29.750 --> 56:31.840
sparks, they are all fire, and every

56:31.840 --> 56:34.288
one doth shine; but there's but one

56:34.288 --> 56:37.060
in all doth hold his place.

56:37.060 --> 56:39.260
So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with

56:39.260 --> 56:41.610
men, and men are flesh and blood,

56:41.610 --> 56:43.550
and apprehensive; yet in the number

56:43.550 --> 56:46.680
I do know but one that unassailable

56:46.680 --> 56:50.670
holds on his rank, unshaked of motion,

56:50.670 --> 56:55.670
and that I am he, let me a
little show it, even in this,

56:57.980 --> 57:01.600
that I was constant
Cimber should be banish'd,

57:01.600 --> 57:04.190
and constant do remain to keep him so.

57:04.190 --> 57:05.023
- O Caesar--
- Hence!

57:05.023 --> 57:06.370
Wilt thou lift up Olympus?
- Great Caesar--

57:06.370 --> 57:08.020
- Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?

57:08.020 --> 57:09.607
- Speak, hands, for me!

57:09.607 --> 57:14.607
(shouting)
(dramatic music)

57:37.231 --> 57:41.731
(stabbing)
(groaning)

57:59.582 --> 58:01.082
- You too, Brutus?

58:08.460 --> 58:09.960
Then fall, Caesar!

58:11.863 --> 58:15.946
(stabs)
(groans)

58:35.000 --> 58:36.083
- [Cinna] Liberty!

58:36.083 --> 58:37.107
Freedom!

58:37.107 --> 58:38.535
Tyranny is dead!

58:38.535 --> 58:42.414
Run hence, proclaim, cry
it about the streets.

58:42.414 --> 58:44.395
- [Citizen] Some to the
common pulpits and cry

58:44.395 --> 58:47.978
out, liberty, freedom,
and enfranchisement!

58:48.904 --> 58:50.325
- [Cinna] People and
senators, be not affrighted--

58:50.325 --> 58:52.786
- [Brutus] Speak hands, for me.

58:52.786 --> 58:56.528
- [Cinna] Tyranny is
dead, tyranny is dead!

58:56.528 --> 58:58.448
Crime upon the street,
crime upon the street!

58:58.448 --> 59:00.948
- People, people and Senators!

59:02.807 --> 59:04.390
Be not afrightened!

59:05.427 --> 59:10.427
Fly not; stand still;
ambition's debt is paid.

59:11.097 --> 59:12.801
(bells ringing)

59:12.801 --> 59:16.634
- Go to the pulpit, Brutus.
- And Cassius too.

59:24.867 --> 59:28.250
- Where's Antony?
- Fled to his house amazed.

59:28.250 --> 59:31.470
Men, wives, and children
stare, cry out, and

59:31.470 --> 59:32.930
run, as it were doomsday.

59:32.930 --> 59:35.560
- Fates, we will know your pleasures.

59:35.560 --> 59:37.060
That we shall die, we know; 'tis but

59:37.060 --> 59:40.350
the time and drawing days
out, that men stand upon.

59:40.350 --> 59:41.850
- Why, he that cuts off 20 years

59:41.850 --> 59:44.760
of life cuts off so many
years of fearing death.

59:44.760 --> 59:47.400
- Grant that, and then is death a benefit.

59:47.400 --> 59:49.420
So are we Caesar's friends,

59:49.420 --> 59:52.053
that have abridged his
time of fearing death.

59:53.510 --> 59:57.250
Stoop, Romans, stoop, and

59:57.250 --> 59:59.770
let us bathe our hands in Caesar's

59:59.770 --> 01:00:04.770
blood up to the elbows,
and besmear our swords.

01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:07.760
Then walk we forth,
even to the marketplace,

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:10.730
and waving our red weapons o'er our heads,

01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:13.897
let's all cry, peace, freedom, liberty!

01:00:18.748 --> 01:00:21.415
- [All] Peace, freedom, liberty!

01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:24.143
- Stoop then, and wash.

01:00:31.041 --> 01:00:35.510
How many ages hence shall
this our lofty scene be

01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:40.220
acted o'er in states unborn
and accents yet unknown!

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:42.030
- How many times shall Caesar bleed in

01:00:42.030 --> 01:00:44.760
sport, that now on Pompey's basis

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:46.840
lies along no worthier than the dust!

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:49.670
- So oft as that shall be, so often

01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:52.320
shall the knot of us be call'd the

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.830
ones that gave their country liberty.

01:00:54.830 --> 01:00:56.693
- What, shall we forth?

01:00:57.692 --> 01:00:58.792
- Aye, every one away.

01:00:59.748 --> 01:01:02.914
Brutus shall lead; and
we will grace his heels

01:01:02.914 --> 01:01:07.053
with the most boldest
and best hearts of Rome.

01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:11.183
- Soft, who comes here?

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:14.703
A friend of Antony's.

01:01:21.930 --> 01:01:24.353
- Thus, Brutus, did my
master bid me kneel;

01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:28.030
thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;

01:01:28.030 --> 01:01:30.130
and, being prostrate, thus he bade me say.

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:34.990
Brutus is noble, wise,
valiant, and honest;

01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:38.180
Caesar was mighty,
bold, royal, and loving;

01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:41.880
say I love Brutus and I honor him;

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:44.330
say I fear'd Caesar,
honour'd him, and loved him.

01:01:45.517 --> 01:01:47.720
If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:49.440
may safely come to him, and be

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.170
resolved how Caesar hath deserved to

01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:54.090
lie in death, Mark Antony shall not

01:01:54.090 --> 01:01:57.120
love Caesar dead so well as Brutus living;

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.980
but shall follow all
the affairs and fortunes

01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:00.260
of noble Brutus through

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:04.832
the hazards of this untrod
state with all true faith.

01:02:04.832 --> 01:02:06.883
So says my master Antony.

01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:16.430
- Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;

01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:18.363
I never thought him worse.

01:02:20.219 --> 01:02:22.930
Tell him, so please him come unto

01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:25.860
this place, he shall be satisfied

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:29.300
and, by my honor, depart untouch'd.

01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:30.650
- I'll fetch him presently.

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:38.750
- I know that we shall
have him well to friend.

01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:40.190
- I wish I may.

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:44.300
But yet have I a mind that
fears him much; and my misgiving

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:46.653
still falls shrewdly to the purpose.

01:02:49.997 --> 01:02:51.197
- But here comes Antony.

01:02:54.538 --> 01:02:56.253
Welcome, Mark Antony.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.410
- O mighty Caesar!

01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:12.013
Dost thou lie so low?

01:03:15.070 --> 01:03:20.070
Are all thy conquests,
glories, triumphs, spoils,

01:03:21.227 --> 01:03:23.453
shrunk to this little measure?

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:27.493
Fare thee well.

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:33.850
I know not, gentlemen, what you

01:03:33.850 --> 01:03:37.700
intend, who else must be let blood,

01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:38.913
who else is rank.

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:45.253
If I myself, there is no hour
so fit as Caesar's death hour,

01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:47.610
nor no instrument of half that

01:03:47.610 --> 01:03:49.720
worth as those your swords, made rich

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:52.313
with the most noble
blood of all this world.

01:03:54.550 --> 01:03:56.760
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,

01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:00.520
now, whilst your purpled
hands do reek and smoke,

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:01.480
fulfill your pleasure.

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:02.940
Live a thousand years,

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:06.040
I shall not find myself so apt to die.

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:08.210
No place will please me
so, no means of death,

01:04:08.210 --> 01:04:10.633
as here by Caesar, and by you cut off,

01:04:11.490 --> 01:04:13.810
the choice and master spirits of this age.

01:04:13.810 --> 01:04:17.050
- O Antony, beg not your death of us!

01:04:17.050 --> 01:04:19.010
Though now we must appear bloody and

01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:21.610
cruel, as, by our hands and this our

01:04:21.610 --> 01:04:24.933
present act you see we do;
yet see you but our hands.

01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:27.833
Our hearts you see not.

01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:31.380
They are pitiful, and pity
to the general wrong of

01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:33.973
Rome hath done this deed on Caesar.

01:04:35.130 --> 01:04:37.820
For your part, to you our swords

01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:39.510
have leaden points, Mark Antony.

01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:41.050
- Your voice shall be as strong as any

01:04:41.050 --> 01:04:43.433
man's in the disposing of new dignities.

01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:48.030
- Only be patient til we have appeased

01:04:48.030 --> 01:04:49.630
the multitude, beside themselves

01:04:49.630 --> 01:04:51.870
with fear, and then we will deliver

01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:53.790
you the cause why I, that did love

01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:56.423
Caesar when I struck
him, have thus proceeded.

01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:00.150
- I doubt not of your wisdom.

01:05:03.050 --> 01:05:05.000
Let each man render me his bloody hand.

01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:09.150
First, Marcus Brutus,
will I shake with you.

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:14.603
Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.

01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:21.740
Now, Decius Brutus, yours,
now yours, Metellus.

01:05:28.128 --> 01:05:31.711
Yours, Cinna, and, my
valiant Casca, yours.

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:40.713
Though last, not least in
love, yours, good Trebonius.

01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:53.283
Gentlemen all, alas, what shall I say?

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:57.860
My credit now stands on
such slippery ground,

01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:01.023
that one of two bad ways
you must conceit me,

01:06:02.090 --> 01:06:04.087
either a coward or a flatterer.

01:06:06.614 --> 01:06:08.764
That I did love thee,
Caesar, O, 'tis true.

01:06:11.471 --> 01:06:14.000
If then thy spirit look upon us now,

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.530
shall it not grieve thee
dearer than thy death to see

01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:20.020
thy Antony making his peace,

01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:22.520
shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:25.093
most noble, in the presence of thy corse?

01:06:26.623 --> 01:06:28.710
Had I as many eyes as thou hast

01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:31.870
wounds, weeping as fast as they stream

01:06:31.870 --> 01:06:33.750
forth thy blood, it would become me

01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:35.840
better than to close in terms of

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.603
friendship with thine enemies.

01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:42.803
Pardon me, Julius!

01:06:44.343 --> 01:06:45.610
Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;

01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:48.813
here didst thou fall; and
here thy hunters stand,

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.843
sign'd in thy spoil, and
crimson'd in thy lethe.

01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:59.673
O world, though wast
the forest to this hart.

01:07:01.531 --> 01:07:03.230
And this O world the heart of thee.

01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:05.660
- Mark Antony--
- Pardon me, Caius Cassius.

01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:07.760
The enemies of Caesar shall say this;

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.570
then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.

01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:12.670
- I blame you not for praising Caesar so;

01:07:12.670 --> 01:07:15.633
but what compact mean you to have with us?

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:19.903
Will you be prick'd in
number of our friends, hmm,

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:25.410
or shall we on, and not depend on you?

01:07:25.410 --> 01:07:27.720
- Therefore I took your hands; but was

01:07:28.882 --> 01:07:31.682
indeed sway'd from the point,
by looking down on Caesar.

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:36.370
Friends am I with you
all, and love you all,

01:07:36.370 --> 01:07:37.770
upon this hope, that you shall give

01:07:37.770 --> 01:07:41.710
me reasons why and wherein
Caesar was dangerous.

01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:43.910
- Or else were this a savage spectacle.

01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:46.600
Our reasons are so full of good regard

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:48.190
that were you, Antony, the son of

01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:50.100
Caesar, you should be satisfied.

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:51.223
- That's all I seek.

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:58.740
And am moreover suitor
that I may produce his body

01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:00.680
to the marketplace; and in the pulpit,

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:05.183
as becomes a friend, speak
in the order of his funeral.

01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:08.191
- You shall, Mark Antony.

01:08:08.191 --> 01:08:09.753
- Brutus, a word with you.

01:08:09.753 --> 01:08:13.090
You know not what you do;
do not consent that Antony

01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:14.332
speak in his funeral.

01:08:14.332 --> 01:08:16.819
Know you how much the
people may be moved by that

01:08:16.819 --> 01:08:17.653
which he will utter?

01:08:17.653 --> 01:08:18.893
- By your pardon.

01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:22.263
I will myself into the pulpit first,

01:08:23.170 --> 01:08:25.609
and show the reason of our Caesar's death.

01:08:25.609 --> 01:08:28.819
What Antony shall speak, I will protest

01:08:28.819 --> 01:08:31.080
he speaks by leave and by permission;

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:33.573
it shall advantage more than do us wrong.

01:08:33.573 --> 01:08:36.563
- I know not what may fall; I like it not.

01:08:38.859 --> 01:08:42.140
- Mark Antony, here,
take you Caesar's body.

01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:43.660
You shall not in your funeral

01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:46.670
speech blame us, but speak all good

01:08:46.670 --> 01:08:49.960
you can devise of Caesar; and say

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.250
you do't by our permission; else

01:08:51.250 --> 01:08:54.540
shall you not have any hand
at all about his funeral.

01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:55.803
- I do desire no more.

01:08:58.939 --> 01:09:01.403
- Prepare the body, then, and follow us.

01:09:11.694 --> 01:09:14.194
(tense music)

01:09:26.573 --> 01:09:28.740
(weeping)

01:09:46.569 --> 01:09:48.500
- O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:53.283
earth, that I am meek and
gentle with these butchers!

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:04.370
Thou art the ruins of the noblest men

01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:06.303
that ever lived in the time of times.

01:10:13.506 --> 01:10:17.506
And woe to the hand that
shed this costly blood!

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:27.430
You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?

01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:29.450
- I do, Mark Antony.

01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:31.920
- Caesar did write for
him to come to Rome.

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:34.510
- He did receive his
letters, and is coming;

01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:36.953
and bid me say to you by word of mouth.

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:43.003
O Caesar!

01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:47.907
- Thy heart is big, get
thee apart and weep.

01:10:51.850 --> 01:10:53.563
Passion, I see, is catching.

01:10:56.670 --> 01:10:59.610
Is thy master coming?
(suspenseful music)

01:10:59.610 --> 01:11:01.530
- [Servant] He lies tonight
within seven leagues of Rome.

01:11:01.530 --> 01:11:03.500
- Post back with speed, and
tell him what hath chanced.

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:06.140
Here is a mourning Rome, a
dangerous Rome, no Rome of

01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:10.320
safety for Octavius yet;
hie hence, and tell him so.

01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:14.100
Yet stay awhile; thou shalt
not back til I have borne

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:16.190
this corse into the marketplace.

01:11:16.190 --> 01:11:18.370
There shall I try, in my oration,

01:11:18.370 --> 01:11:20.380
how the people take the cruel issue

01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:21.630
of these bloody men; according to

01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:23.760
the which thou shalt discourse to

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:25.683
young Octavius of the state of things.

01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:30.707
Lend me your hand.

01:11:50.437 --> 01:11:52.687
(shouting)

01:11:55.254 --> 01:12:00.254
- [Citizens] We will be
satisfied; let us be satisfied.

01:12:00.537 --> 01:12:02.548
- Then follow me, and
give me audience, friends.

01:12:02.548 --> 01:12:05.102
- [Third Citizen] The noble
Brutus is ascended; silence!

01:12:05.102 --> 01:12:05.935
- Be patient til the last.

01:12:05.935 --> 01:12:08.074
Romans, countrymen, and lovers!

01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:09.213
- [Citizens] Oh, oh!

01:12:09.213 --> 01:12:13.633
- Hear me for my cause; and
be silent, that you may hear.

01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:15.850
Believe me for mine honor,

01:12:15.850 --> 01:12:18.086
and have respect to mine
honor, that you may believe.

01:12:18.086 --> 01:12:20.240
(clamoring)

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:23.620
Censure me in your wisdom;
and awake your senses,

01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:25.420
that you may the better judge.

01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:28.063
- Oh I'm judging you.
(laughing)

01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:33.120
If there be any in this assembly, any dear

01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:36.040
friend of Caesar's, to him I say

01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:38.963
that Brutus' love to Caesar
was no less than his.

01:12:39.872 --> 01:12:42.513
- Bullshit.
- If then that friend

01:12:42.513 --> 01:12:43.810
demand why Brutus

01:12:43.810 --> 01:12:46.153
rose against Caesar, this is my answer.

01:12:47.130 --> 01:12:51.760
Not that I loved Caesar less,
but that I loved Rome more.

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:54.780
Had you rather Caesar were living,

01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:58.000
and die all slaves, than that Caesar

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.293
were dead, to live all freemen?

01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:04.103
As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;

01:13:05.210 --> 01:13:07.783
as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it;

01:13:09.161 --> 01:13:11.350
as he was valiant, I honor him; but,

01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:15.663
as he was ambitious, I slew him.

01:13:17.690 --> 01:13:21.024
There is tears for his love; joy for

01:13:21.024 --> 01:13:24.460
his fortune; honor for his valor;

01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:27.163
and death for his ambition.

01:13:28.970 --> 01:13:32.003
Who is here so base
that would be a bondman?

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:35.363
If any, speak; for him have I offended.

01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:40.850
Who is here so rude that
would not be a Roman?

01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:44.543
If any, speak; for him have I offended.

01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:50.790
Who is here so vile that
will not love his country?

01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:56.153
If any, speak; for him have I offended.

01:13:58.830 --> 01:14:01.540
I pause for a reply.

01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:05.314
- [Citizens] None, Brutus, none.

01:14:05.314 --> 01:14:06.743
- Then none have I offended.

01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:12.573
I have done no more to Caesar
than you shall do to Brutus.

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:16.180
The question of his death
is enroll'd in the capitol,

01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:20.140
his glory not extenuated,
nor his offenses enforced,

01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:21.963
for which he suffered death.

01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:30.380
Here comes his body,
mourned by Mark Antony, who,

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.930
though he had no hand in
his death, shall receive the

01:14:34.930 --> 01:14:37.692
benefit of his dying, a place in the

01:14:37.692 --> 01:14:41.353
commonwealth; as which of you shall not?

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:44.441
With this I depart.

01:14:44.441 --> 01:14:45.438
(protesting)

01:14:45.438 --> 01:14:49.640
That, as I slew my best
lover for the good of Rome,

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:54.220
I have the same dagger for
myself, when it shall please my

01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:56.500
country to need my death.

01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:57.410
- Live, Brutus!

01:14:58.497 --> 01:14:59.330
Live, live!

01:14:59.330 --> 01:15:00.430
- [First Citizen] Bring him with triumph

01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:01.263
home unto his house.

01:15:01.263 --> 01:15:04.193
- [Third Citizen] Give him
a statue with his ancestors.

01:15:06.009 --> 01:15:07.460
- Let him be Caesar.

01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:11.007
- Caesar's best qualities
shall be crown'd in Brutus.

01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:13.165
(cheering and applauding)

01:15:13.165 --> 01:15:13.998
- We'll bring him to his house with

01:15:13.998 --> 01:15:17.264
shouts and clamors.
(shouting)

01:15:17.264 --> 01:15:19.400
- My countrymen--
- Peace!

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:20.504
Silence!

01:15:20.504 --> 01:15:21.337
Brutus speaks.

01:15:21.337 --> 01:15:22.170
- [First Citizen] Peace, ho!

01:15:22.170 --> 01:15:25.137
- Good countrymen, let me depart alone.

01:15:25.137 --> 01:15:26.137
- [Citizens] No, no.

01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:30.780
- And, for my sake, stay here with Antony.

01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:32.730
Do grace to Caesar's corpse,

01:15:32.730 --> 01:15:35.190
and grace his speech tending to

01:15:35.190 --> 01:15:38.150
Caesar's glory; which Mark Antony,

01:15:38.150 --> 01:15:40.700
by our permission, is allow'd to make.

01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:44.210
I do entreat you, not a man

01:15:44.210 --> 01:15:47.243
depart, save I alone,
til Antony have spoke.

01:15:47.243 --> 01:15:48.244
(clamoring)

01:15:48.244 --> 01:15:49.367
- Stay, ho!

01:15:49.367 --> 01:15:51.050
And let us hear Mark Antony.

01:15:51.050 --> 01:15:52.670
- Let him go up into the public chair;

01:15:52.670 --> 01:15:53.800
we'll hear him.

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:55.243
Noble Antony, go up.

01:15:56.574 --> 01:15:58.374
- For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.

01:15:58.374 --> 01:15:59.378
- [Citizen] What does he say of Brutus?

01:15:59.378 --> 01:16:00.211
- He says, for Brutus' sake, he finds

01:16:00.211 --> 01:16:01.500
himself beholding to us all.

01:16:02.871 --> 01:16:04.896
- 'Twere best he speak
no harm of Brutus here.

01:16:04.896 --> 01:16:05.729
- This Caesar was a tyrant.

01:16:05.729 --> 01:16:06.950
- Nay, that's certain.

01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:08.720
We are blest that Rome is rid of him.

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:09.553
Peace!

01:16:09.553 --> 01:16:11.263
Let us hear what Antony can say.

01:16:12.112 --> 01:16:16.557
- Friends, Romans,
countrymen, lend me your ears;

01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:24.103
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.

01:16:25.450 --> 01:16:27.663
The evil that men do lives after them;

01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:30.450
the good is oft interred with their bones.

01:16:30.450 --> 01:16:32.193
So let it be with Caesar.

01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:37.333
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,

01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:39.375
for Brutus is an honorable man.

01:16:39.375 --> 01:16:40.308
- [Citizens] That's right, yes.

01:16:40.308 --> 01:16:43.990
- So are they all, all honorable men,

01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:45.803
come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.

01:16:49.630 --> 01:16:54.313
He was my friend, faithful and just to me.

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:59.178
But Brutus says he was ambitious;

01:16:59.178 --> 01:17:00.290
(murmuring)

01:17:00.290 --> 01:17:02.263
and Brutus is an honorable man.

01:17:05.230 --> 01:17:06.890
He hath brought many captives home

01:17:06.890 --> 01:17:11.473
to Rome, whose ransoms did
the general coffers fill.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.093
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:20.353
When that the poor have
cried, Caesar hath wept.

01:17:22.130 --> 01:17:24.823
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:28.840
But Brutus says he was ambitious;

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:31.423
and Brutus is an honorable man.

01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:37.850
You all did see that on
the Lupercal I thrice

01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:39.930
presented him a kingly crown, which

01:17:39.930 --> 01:17:41.623
he did thrice refuse.

01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:44.483
Was this ambition?

01:17:47.370 --> 01:17:49.800
But Brutus says he was ambitious;

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:52.100
and, sure, he is an honorable man.

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:54.000
I speak not to disprove what Brutus

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:59.000
spoke, but here I am to
speak what I do know.

01:17:59.290 --> 01:18:02.393
You all did love him
once, not without cause.

01:18:04.210 --> 01:18:07.443
What cause withholds you,
then, to mourn for him?

01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:11.570
O judgment, thou art fled to brutish

01:18:11.570 --> 01:18:13.820
beasts, and men have lost their reason!

01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:18.820
Bear with me; my heart is in
the coffin there with Caesar,

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:21.463
and I must pause til it come back to me.

01:18:23.778 --> 01:18:24.783
- [First Citizen] Methinks there is

01:18:24.783 --> 01:18:25.616
much reason in his sayings.

01:18:25.616 --> 01:18:26.550
- [Second Citizen] If thou
consider rightly of the

01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:28.763
matter, Caesar has had great wrong.

01:18:28.763 --> 01:18:30.030
- Has he not, masters?

01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:31.680
I fear there will a
worse come in his place.

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:32.980
- Mark'd ye his words?

01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:34.623
He would not take the crown;

01:18:34.623 --> 01:18:36.290
therefore 'tis certain
he was not ambitious.

01:18:36.290 --> 01:18:39.380
- If it be found so,
some will dear abide it.

01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:40.213
- [First Citizen] Poor soul!

01:18:40.213 --> 01:18:42.460
His eyes are red as fire with weeping.

01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:44.360
- [Third Citizen] There's
not a nobler man in Rome

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:45.420
than Antony.

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:47.018
- [Fourth Citizen] Now mark him;

01:18:47.018 --> 01:18:48.153
he begins again to speak.

01:18:49.670 --> 01:18:52.880
- But yesterday the word of Caesar

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:55.133
might have stood against the world.

01:18:56.420 --> 01:19:00.343
Now lies he there, and none
so poor to do him reverence.

01:19:02.410 --> 01:19:05.610
O masters, if I were disposed to

01:19:05.610 --> 01:19:07.890
stir your hearts and minds to mutiny

01:19:07.890 --> 01:19:10.700
and rage, I should do Brutus wrong

01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:14.143
and Cassius wrong, who, you
all know, are honorable men.

01:19:16.450 --> 01:19:21.450
I will not do them wrong;
I rather choose to wrong

01:19:21.610 --> 01:19:24.950
the dead, to wrong myself, and you,

01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:27.373
than I will wrong such honorable men.

01:19:28.410 --> 01:19:31.723
But here's a parchment
with the seal of Caesar,

01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:36.441
I found it in his closet, 'tis his will.

01:19:36.441 --> 01:19:37.690
(murmuring)

01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:39.970
Let but the commons hear this testament,

01:19:39.970 --> 01:19:42.706
which, pardon me, I do not mean to read,

01:19:42.706 --> 01:19:47.273
and they would go and
kiss dead Caesar's wounds,

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:50.620
and dip their napkins in his sacred blood;

01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:52.600
yea, beg a hair of him for memory,

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:55.180
and, dying, mention it within their wills,

01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:57.339
bequeathing it as a rich
legacy unto their issue.

01:19:57.339 --> 01:19:59.106
(shouting)

01:19:59.106 --> 01:20:00.111
- [Fourth Citizen] We'll hear the will.

01:20:00.111 --> 01:20:00.944
Read it, Mark Antony.

01:20:00.944 --> 01:20:03.743
- [Citizens] The will, the
will, the will, the will!

01:20:05.670 --> 01:20:07.730
- Have patience, have patience

01:20:07.730 --> 01:20:09.493
gentle friends, I must not read it;

01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:13.483
it is not meet you know
how Caesar loved you.

01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:16.910
You are not wood, you are not stones,

01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:19.960
but men; and, being men,
hearing the will of Caesar,

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:22.999
it will inflame you, it will make you mad.

01:20:22.999 --> 01:20:23.907
- Read the will.
- We will hear it Mark Antony.

01:20:23.907 --> 01:20:26.980
We will read the will, Caesar's will.

01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:27.870
- Will you be patient?

01:20:27.870 --> 01:20:28.860
Will you stay awhile?

01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:30.830
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it.

01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:33.750
I fear I wrong the honorable
men whose daggers have

01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:34.966
stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.

01:20:34.966 --> 01:20:35.799
(shouting)

01:20:35.799 --> 01:20:37.355
- [Fourth Citizen] They were
traitors, honorable men!

01:20:37.355 --> 01:20:38.188
- [Citizens] The will, the testament!

01:20:38.188 --> 01:20:39.330
- They were villains, murderers.

01:20:39.330 --> 01:20:40.863
The will, read the will!

01:20:42.410 --> 01:20:44.130
- You will compel me,
then, to read the will?

01:20:44.130 --> 01:20:44.963
- [Citizens] Aye!

01:20:46.012 --> 01:20:46.845
- Then make a ring about the corpse of

01:20:46.845 --> 01:20:49.133
Caesar, and let me show
you him that made the will.

01:20:50.890 --> 01:20:52.586
Shall I descend?

01:20:52.586 --> 01:20:53.763
And will you give me leave?

01:20:53.763 --> 01:20:54.596
- [Citizens] Come down.

01:20:54.596 --> 01:20:55.429
- [Second Citizen] Descend.

01:20:55.429 --> 01:20:56.781
- [Third Citizen] You shall have leave.

01:20:56.781 --> 01:20:58.379
- [Fourth Citizen] A ring, stand round.

01:20:58.379 --> 01:20:59.645
Ring, stand round.

01:20:59.645 --> 01:21:01.653
- [First Citizen] Stand from the hearse,

01:21:01.653 --> 01:21:02.486
stand from the body.

01:21:02.486 --> 01:21:03.610
- Room for Antony, noble Antony!

01:21:03.610 --> 01:21:05.640
- Nay, press not so
upon me; stand far' off.

01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:07.492
- Stand back; room!

01:21:07.492 --> 01:21:08.325
Bear back.

01:21:10.398 --> 01:21:12.698
- If you have tears,
prepare to shed them now.

01:21:16.573 --> 01:21:17.530
(tense music)

01:21:17.530 --> 01:21:18.933
You all do know this mantle.

01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:25.743
Look, in this place ran
Cassius' dagger through.

01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:31.243
See what a rent the envious Casca made.

01:21:34.523 --> 01:21:37.440
Through this the
well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;

01:21:39.512 --> 01:21:41.670
and as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,

01:21:41.670 --> 01:21:43.720
mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,

01:21:44.570 --> 01:21:47.310
as rushing out of doors, to be resolved if

01:21:47.310 --> 01:21:50.100
Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;

01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:52.463
for Brutus, as you know,
was Caesar's angel.

01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:59.313
This was the most unkindest cut of all;

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:05.210
for when the noble Caesar saw him stab,

01:22:05.210 --> 01:22:08.610
ingratitude, stronger than traitors' arms,

01:22:08.610 --> 01:22:09.640
quite vanquish'd him.

01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:11.323
Then burst his mighty heart;

01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:14.700
and, in his mantle muffling up his face,

01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:16.390
even at the base of Pompey's statue,

01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:19.453
which all the while ran
blood, great Caesar fell.

01:22:24.258 --> 01:22:27.634
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!

01:22:27.634 --> 01:22:29.889
(weeping)

01:22:29.889 --> 01:22:33.889
Then I, and you, and all
of us fell down, whilst

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:38.107
bloody treason flourish'd over us.

01:22:38.107 --> 01:22:41.110
What, now you weep; and, I perceive,

01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:42.893
you feel the dint of pity.

01:22:44.175 --> 01:22:46.163
These are gracious drops.

01:22:47.190 --> 01:22:49.560
Kind souls, what, weep you
when you but behold our

01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:50.873
Caesar's vesture wounded?

01:22:51.736 --> 01:22:53.663
Look you here!
(shouting)

01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:55.686
Here is himself,

01:22:55.686 --> 01:22:57.057
marr'd, as you see, with traitors.

01:22:57.057 --> 01:22:57.890
- [First Citizen] O piteous spectacle!

01:22:57.890 --> 01:22:58.723
- [Second Citizen] O noble Caesar!

01:22:58.723 --> 01:22:59.556
- [Third Citizen] O woeful day!

01:22:59.556 --> 01:23:01.344
- [Fourth Citizen] O traitors, villains!

01:23:01.344 --> 01:23:03.109
- [First Citizen] O most bloody sight!

01:23:03.109 --> 01:23:04.384
We will be revenged.

01:23:04.384 --> 01:23:06.134
- Good friends, sweet friends,

01:23:06.134 --> 01:23:07.320
(dramatic music)

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:10.610
let me not stir you up to
such a sudden flood of mutiny.

01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:13.276
They that have done
this deed are honorable.

01:23:13.276 --> 01:23:14.210
- Bullshit.
- What private griefs

01:23:14.210 --> 01:23:16.550
they have, alas, I know
not, that made them do it;

01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:18.936
they're wise and honorable, and will,

01:23:18.936 --> 01:23:22.040
no doubt, with reasons answer you.

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:25.030
- To hell with your reasons!
- I come not, friends,

01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:26.573
to steal away your hearts.

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:30.430
I am no orator, as Brutus is;

01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:32.090
but, as you know me all, a plain

01:23:32.090 --> 01:23:34.873
blunt man, that love my friend.

01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:39.830
I only speak right on; I tell

01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:42.074
you that which you yourselves do

01:23:42.074 --> 01:23:47.040
know; show you sweet Caesar's wounds,

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:49.670
poor dumb mouths, and
bid them speak for me.

01:23:49.670 --> 01:23:52.240
But were I Brutus, and Brutus

01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:54.350
Antony, there were an Antony would

01:23:54.350 --> 01:23:56.320
ruffle up your spirits, and put a

01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:58.580
tongue in every wound of Caesar,

01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:03.580
that should move the stones
of Rome to rise and mutiny.

01:24:03.837 --> 01:24:04.670
- [Citizens] We'll mutiny!

01:24:04.670 --> 01:24:05.503
Mutiny!

01:24:06.503 --> 01:24:08.823
- [First Citizen] We'll
burn the house of Brutus.

01:24:08.823 --> 01:24:09.820
- [Third Citizen] Away, then!

01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:11.695
Come, seek the conspirators.
(shouting)

01:24:11.695 --> 01:24:14.610
- Yet hear me, countrymen;
yet hear me speak.

01:24:14.610 --> 01:24:16.490
Alas, you go to do you not what.

01:24:17.847 --> 01:24:19.207
Wherein Caesar hath deserved your love

01:24:19.207 --> 01:24:22.177
you have forgot the will I told you of.

01:24:22.177 --> 01:24:23.010
- [Citizens] Most true; the will!

01:24:23.010 --> 01:24:23.920
Let's stay, and hear the will.

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:26.883
- Here is the will, and
under Caesar's seal.

01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:32.033
To every Roman citizen he gives,

01:24:33.594 --> 01:24:37.446
to every several man, 75 drachmas.

01:24:37.446 --> 01:24:38.279
(shouting)

01:24:38.279 --> 01:24:39.660
Moreover, he hath left you all his

01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:42.720
walks, his private arbors, and newplanted

01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:44.410
orchards, on this side Tiber.

01:24:44.410 --> 01:24:46.290
He hath left them you, and to your

01:24:46.290 --> 01:24:49.000
heirs forever; common pleasures, to

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.360
walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.

01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:53.770
Here was a Caesar!

01:24:53.770 --> 01:24:55.976
When comes such another?

01:24:55.976 --> 01:24:57.970
- Never, never.

01:24:57.970 --> 01:24:58.803
Come, away, away!

01:24:58.803 --> 01:25:00.547
We'll burn his body in the holy place,

01:25:00.547 --> 01:25:03.955
and with the brands fire
the traitors' houses.

01:25:03.955 --> 01:25:05.372
Take up the body.

01:25:06.236 --> 01:25:07.462
- [First Citizen] Go, fetch fire.

01:25:07.462 --> 01:25:08.839
- [Third Citizen] Pluck down benches.

01:25:08.839 --> 01:25:11.058
- [Fourth Citizen] Pluck down
forms, windows, any thing.

01:25:11.058 --> 01:25:16.058
(shouting)
(dramatic music)

01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:23.929
- Now let it work.

01:25:23.929 --> 01:25:24.762
Mischief, thou art afoot,

01:25:24.762 --> 01:25:26.140
take thou what course thou wilt!

01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:34.000
How now, fellow?

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.260
- Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.

01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:37.093
- Where is he?

01:25:37.932 --> 01:25:38.977
- He is at Caesar's house.

01:25:38.977 --> 01:25:41.550
- And thither will I
straight to visit him.

01:25:41.550 --> 01:25:43.040
He comes upon a wish.

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:46.641
Fortune is merry, and in this
mood will give us any thing.

01:25:46.641 --> 01:25:48.130
- I heard 'em say Brutus and Cassius

01:25:48.130 --> 01:25:50.763
are rid like madmen
through the gates of Rome.

01:25:52.129 --> 01:25:53.770
- Belike they had some notice of the

01:25:53.770 --> 01:25:55.843
people, how I had moved them.

01:25:57.480 --> 01:25:58.703
Bring me to Octavius.

01:26:22.833 --> 01:26:23.900
- I dreamt tonight that I did feast

01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:28.900
with Caesar, and things
unluckily charge my fantasy.

01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:31.970
I have no will to wander forth of doors,

01:26:31.970 --> 01:26:34.427
yet something leads me forth.

01:26:34.427 --> 01:26:36.760
(whistling)

01:26:40.586 --> 01:26:43.003
(chattering)

01:26:52.739 --> 01:26:53.747
- What is your name?

01:26:53.747 --> 01:26:54.750
- Whither are you going?

01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:55.753
- Where do you dwell?

01:26:55.753 --> 01:26:56.586
- Are you a married man or a bachelor?

01:26:56.586 --> 01:26:58.253
- Answer every man directly.

01:26:58.253 --> 01:26:59.881
- Aye, and briefly.

01:26:59.881 --> 01:27:00.714
- Aye, and wisely.

01:27:00.714 --> 01:27:02.897
- Aye, and truly; you were best.

01:27:02.897 --> 01:27:03.730
- What is my name?

01:27:03.730 --> 01:27:04.563
Whither am I going?

01:27:04.563 --> 01:27:05.908
Where do I dwell?

01:27:05.908 --> 01:27:06.780
Am I a married man or a bachelor?

01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:09.420
Then, to answer every
man directly and briefly,

01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:10.740
wisely and truly.

01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:13.120
Wisely I say I am a bachelor.

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:14.800
- That's as much as to say they are

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:18.800
fools that marry; you'll bear
me a bang for that, I fear.

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:20.240
Proceed; directly.

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:22.281
- Directly, I am going
to Caesar's funeral.

01:27:22.281 --> 01:27:24.140
- As a friend, or an enemy?

01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:25.420
- As a friend.

01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:27.370
- That matter is answered directly.

01:27:27.370 --> 01:27:29.070
- For your dwelling, briefly.

01:27:29.070 --> 01:27:30.463
- Briefly, I dwell by the capitol.

01:27:30.463 --> 01:27:32.230
- Your name, sir, truly.

01:27:32.230 --> 01:27:33.642
- Truly, my name is Cinna.

01:27:33.642 --> 01:27:35.227
(shouting)

01:27:35.227 --> 01:27:36.920
- Tear him to pieces!

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:37.950
He's a conspirator.

01:27:37.950 --> 01:27:40.230
- I am Cinna the poet,
I am Cinna the poet.

01:27:40.230 --> 01:27:43.912
- Tear him for his bad verses,
tear him for his bad verses.

01:27:43.912 --> 01:27:45.200
- I am not Cinna the conspirator.

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:48.143
- It is no matter, his name's Cinna;

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:51.906
pluck but his name out of his
heart, and turn him going.

01:27:51.906 --> 01:27:54.156
(laughing)

01:27:56.420 --> 01:27:58.731
- Tear him, tear him!

01:27:58.731 --> 01:28:00.795
(suspenseful music)
(hitting)

01:28:00.795 --> 01:28:04.045
(laughing and mocking)

01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:58.190
Come; brands, ho!

01:28:58.190 --> 01:29:00.262
Firebrands.
(dramatic music)

01:29:00.262 --> 01:29:03.690
To Brutus', to Cassius'; burn all.

01:29:03.690 --> 01:29:06.577
Some to Decius' house,
and some to Casca's'.

01:29:07.426 --> 01:29:08.801
Away, go!

01:29:08.801 --> 01:29:11.134
(clamoring)

01:29:12.289 --> 01:29:14.539
(shouting)

01:29:23.017 --> 01:29:26.017
(footsteps tapping)

01:29:28.130 --> 01:29:29.610
- [The Soothsayer] Over thy wounds now

01:29:29.610 --> 01:29:30.643
do I prophesy.

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:35.839
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men.

01:29:35.839 --> 01:29:38.440
(wind whistling)
(thunder rumbling)

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:41.430
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife

01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:45.470
shall cumber all the
parts of the known world.

01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:48.940
Blood and destruction shall be so in use

01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:51.930
and dreadful objects so familiar

01:29:51.930 --> 01:29:55.010
that mothers shall but
smile when they behold

01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:58.550
their infants quartered
with the hands of war.

01:29:58.550 --> 01:30:03.550
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds.

01:30:07.761 --> 01:30:10.511
(hoofs pounding) - [Cassius] Most
noble brother, you have done me wrong.

01:30:29.350 --> 01:30:31.010
- [Brutus] Judge me, you gods!

01:30:31.010 --> 01:30:32.860
Wrong I mine enemies?

01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:35.280
And, if not so, how
should I wrong a brother?

01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:39.404
- [Cassius] Brutus, this sober
form of yours hides wrongs.

01:30:39.404 --> 01:30:41.050
(horse neighs)
And when you do them--

01:30:41.050 --> 01:30:46.050
- [Brutus] Remember March,
the Ides of March remember.

01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:49.360
Did not great Julius
bleed for justice' sake?

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:51.590
What villain touch'd
his body, that did stab,

01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:52.843
and not for justice?

01:30:54.232 --> 01:30:57.011
(horse nickers)

01:30:57.011 --> 01:30:58.817
- [Cassius] You know that you
are Brutus that speak this,

01:30:58.817 --> 01:31:01.660
and by the gods this
speech wilst your last!

01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:02.780
- [Brutus] Away, slight man!

01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:03.830
- [Cassius] O gods, ye gods!

01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:05.290
Must I endure all this?

01:31:05.290 --> 01:31:06.123
- [Brutus] All this?

01:31:06.123 --> 01:31:06.956
Aye, more.

01:31:06.956 --> 01:31:09.264
Fret til your proud heart break;

01:31:09.264 --> 01:31:11.557
go show your slaves how choleric you are,

01:31:11.557 --> 01:31:13.360
and make your bondmen tremble.

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:16.720
- [Cassius] Do not presume
too much upon my love.

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:19.404
I may do that I shall be sorry for!

01:31:19.404 --> 01:31:20.392
(horse neighing)

01:31:20.392 --> 01:31:22.319
- [Brutus] You have done
that you should be sorry for!

01:31:22.319 --> 01:31:23.202
(hoofs pounding)

01:31:23.202 --> 01:31:24.652
- [Cassius] Ye gods, ye gods!

01:31:27.439 --> 01:31:29.980
(dramatic music)

01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:34.180
- [Brutus] There is a
tide in the affairs of men

01:31:35.770 --> 01:31:40.670
which taken at the flood
leads unto fortune.

01:31:43.883 --> 01:31:47.670
Omitted, all the voyage of their life

01:31:47.670 --> 01:31:52.670
is bound in shallows and in miseries.

01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:58.707
On such a--
- On such a full sea

01:31:58.707 --> 01:32:03.707
are we now afloat, and
we must take the current

01:32:05.090 --> 01:32:09.297
when it serves or lose our ventures.

01:32:10.612 --> 01:32:13.945
(cheering and shouting)

01:32:27.850 --> 01:32:30.920
- [Pindarus] Fly further off,
my lord, fly further off!

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:33.840
Mark Antony is in your tent, my lord.

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:38.550
Fly, therefore noble Cassius, fly far off.

01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:41.010
- [Cassius] This hill is far enough.

01:32:41.010 --> 01:32:43.420
Go Pindarus, get higher on that hill

01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:45.903
and tell me what thou
notes about the field.

01:32:46.786 --> 01:32:49.630
(footsteps rustling)

01:32:49.630 --> 01:32:51.223
This day I breathed first.

01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:55.523
Time has come round and where I did begin,

01:32:56.790 --> 01:32:57.690
there shall I end.

01:32:58.820 --> 01:33:00.610
My life has run its compass.

01:33:00.610 --> 01:33:02.160
Sirrah, what news?

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.759
- Oh, my lord!
- What news?

01:33:04.759 --> 01:33:07.090
- [Man] Trebonius is enclosed
round about with horsemen,

01:33:07.090 --> 01:33:08.543
that make to him on the
spur, yet he spurs on!

01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:12.290
Now they're almost on him.

01:33:12.290 --> 01:33:15.028
Now, now Trebonius!

01:33:15.028 --> 01:33:16.767
Now some light. Oh, he lights too!

01:33:18.450 --> 01:33:19.283
Oh he's ta'en.

01:33:20.189 --> 01:33:22.439
(shouting)

01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:26.620
And hark, they shout for joy.

01:33:28.254 --> 01:33:30.163
- [Cassius] Come down. Bold no more.

01:33:31.463 --> 01:33:34.655
(footsteps rustling)

01:33:34.655 --> 01:33:36.235
Come hither, sirrah.

01:33:36.235 --> 01:33:37.960
In Parthia did I take thee prisoner

01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:40.720
and then I swore thee saving of thy life

01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:44.580
that whatsoever I bid thee
do thou shouldst attempt it.

01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:46.490
Come now, keep thine oath.

01:33:46.490 --> 01:33:48.110
Now be a free man.

01:33:48.110 --> 01:33:52.450
And with this good sword that
ran through Caesar's bowels,

01:33:52.450 --> 01:33:53.743
search this bosom.

01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:57.833
Stand not to answer,
here, take thou the hilt.

01:33:59.635 --> 01:34:02.087
And when my face is covered as 'tis now,

01:34:02.087 --> 01:34:03.413
guide thou the sword.

01:34:04.750 --> 01:34:07.770
(stabs)
(groans)

01:34:07.770 --> 01:34:08.603
Caesar.

01:34:09.853 --> 01:34:12.230
(groaning)

01:34:12.230 --> 01:34:13.403
Thou art revenged.

01:34:14.651 --> 01:34:16.930
(laughing)

01:34:16.930 --> 01:34:19.763
Even with the sword that killed thee.

01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:29.350
- [Pindarus] So I am free
yet would not so have be.

01:34:31.005 --> 01:34:32.121
(shouting)

01:34:32.121 --> 01:34:34.255
- [Cilla] Liberty, freedom!

01:34:34.255 --> 01:34:37.172
(weapons clanging)

01:34:40.151 --> 01:34:41.968
- [Brutus] Yet.

01:34:41.968 --> 01:34:43.016
Yet countrymen.

01:34:43.016 --> 01:34:47.274
Oh yet, hold up your heads.

01:34:47.274 --> 01:34:49.607
(screaming)

01:34:50.817 --> 01:34:53.465
Countrymen, follow me!

01:34:53.465 --> 01:34:55.715
(shouting)

01:34:58.062 --> 01:34:59.062
I am Brutus!

01:35:00.289 --> 01:35:01.872
Know me for Brutus! Marcus Brutus I!

01:35:03.374 --> 01:35:07.291
Brutus, my country friend!
Know me for Brutus!

01:35:14.561 --> 01:35:18.393
Come poor remains of
friends, rest on this rock.

01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:23.030
- [Clitus] Decius showed
the torchlight but my lord,

01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:24.343
he came not back.

01:35:25.270 --> 01:35:27.303
He is or ta'en or slain.

01:35:29.813 --> 01:35:32.040
- [Brutus] Sit thee down, Clitus.

01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:34.113
Slaying is the word.

01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:36.773
It is a deed in fashion.

01:35:37.770 --> 01:35:40.520
(dramatic music)

01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:43.013
Come hither, good Cinna.

01:35:44.389 --> 01:35:45.839
List a word.
- [Cinna] Says my lord?

01:35:47.319 --> 01:35:49.190
- [Brutus] Why this, Cinna.

01:35:49.190 --> 01:35:51.580
I know my hour has come.

01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:52.880
- [Cinna] Not so, my lord.

01:35:54.748 --> 01:35:57.600
- [Brutus] Nay I am sure it is, Cinna.

01:35:57.600 --> 01:35:59.670
Thou seest the world, Cinna,

01:35:59.670 --> 01:36:04.670
how it goes. Our enemies
have beat us to the pit.

01:36:05.154 --> 01:36:05.987
(horses neighing)

01:36:05.987 --> 01:36:08.260
It's more worthy to leap in ourselves

01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:10.343
than tarry til they push us.

01:36:11.370 --> 01:36:15.413
Good Cinna, thou knowst we
two went to school together.

01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:19.957
Even for that our love of old I prithee,

01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:24.793
hold thou my sword hilt
whilst I run on it.

01:36:25.813 --> 01:36:28.313
- [Cinna] That's not an
office for a friend, my lord.

01:36:28.313 --> 01:36:30.313
(sighs)

01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:35.141
- [Clitus] Fly, fly my lord,
there's no tarrying here.

01:36:35.141 --> 01:36:37.391
(shouting)

01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:44.143
Fly, my lord, fly!

01:36:45.891 --> 01:36:47.308
- [Brutus] Hence.

01:36:48.687 --> 01:36:53.310
I will follow.

01:36:53.310 --> 01:36:55.593
I prithee Strato, stay thou by thy lord.

01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:59.660
Thou art a fellow of a good respect.

01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:02.233
Thy life hath had some
smack of honor in it.

01:37:04.270 --> 01:37:07.900
Hold then my sword and turn away thy face

01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:10.000
while I do run upon it.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.357
Wilt thou, Strato?

01:37:12.248 --> 01:37:13.523
- [Strato] Give me your hand first.

01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:17.073
Fare thee well, my lord.

01:37:19.466 --> 01:37:22.216
- [Brutus] Farewell, good Strato.

01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:27.573
Caesar, now be still.

01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:33.120
I killed not thee with
half so good a will.

01:37:35.144 --> 01:37:39.394
