WEBVTT

00:09.837 --> 00:11.448
That was probably

00:11.744 --> 00:14.361
our second-best
potato chip war ever.

00:16.696 --> 00:18.796
What the hell?!

00:20.895 --> 00:22.773
We'll clean it
up later, dude.

00:23.468 --> 00:27.282
I'm not your "dude," and
you never clean anything up.

00:27.666 --> 00:32.308
Well, we mean to, but then we leave, and then
we come back, and it's already cleaned up.

00:34.370 --> 00:37.814
You eat my food,
you dirty up my house

00:37.844 --> 00:39.739
and every time I
go into a bedroom,

00:39.786 --> 00:43.713
I have to wonder about finding one
of you naked with some poor girl!

00:44.931 --> 00:48.450
Well, at least you know that if you
find me naked in a room, I'm by myself.

00:49.360 --> 00:55.582
All right, I want everybody who doesn't
live in this house to get out now!

00:57.610 --> 00:59.803
You know what? You're
a real bummer, man.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.387
Come on, Fez, let's
go to our new apartment

01:02.415 --> 01:05.260
where people can do whatever
they want, whenever they want.

01:05.284 --> 01:07.265
Just like the bible says,

01:07.324 --> 01:09.926
"let my people do
whatever they want."

01:11.449 --> 01:12.336
Eric,

01:12.972 --> 01:19.063
the high school sent over your transcript, which
means you can start applying to teachers' college.

01:19.107 --> 01:24.060
Now you tell me what school you wanna
go to, and I will send them a pie.

01:24.784 --> 01:29.588
Because you cannot eat a lady's pie and
then not let her son into the school.

01:30.475 --> 01:32.219
I gotta admit, Forman,

01:32.308 --> 01:34.466
it's nice finally seeing you
do something with your life.

01:34.496 --> 01:38.768
It almost inspires me to make my record
store the best damn store in the region.

01:39.833 --> 01:40.727
Nah.

01:42.117 --> 01:46.241
It says here that Eric got
an "I-n-c" in gym class.

01:46.744 --> 01:48.237
"I-n-C."

01:48.429 --> 01:51.756
I bet that stands
for "incredible."

01:58.611 --> 02:00.902
Kitty, it's "incomplete."

02:00.947 --> 02:03.756
I know. You have to
add the "redible."

02:06.535 --> 02:09.869
You have failed "to meet the
requirements for graduation.

02:09.913 --> 02:14.112
To receive your diploma, "you
must attend summer session P. E."

02:16.004 --> 02:16.787
Ha!

02:18.606 --> 02:19.404
Ha?

02:20.513 --> 02:24.368
I didn't graduate, and all
you have to say is "ha"?

02:25.787 --> 02:26.615
Oh.

02:26.778 --> 02:29.217
And also, hee hee.

02:30.429 --> 02:31.908
This sucks.

02:31.937 --> 02:34.697
Yep, but you have to
remember one thing, Forman.

02:34.859 --> 02:37.151
It only sucks for you.

I can't believe
I'm back in gym,

03:26.667 --> 03:30.549
or as I like to call it, "the
institute of things I can't do."

03:32.988 --> 03:34.925
Casey Kelso?

03:36.492 --> 03:38.606
Hi there, Pinciotti.

03:38.665 --> 03:42.213
Wow, look who you got with
you... little Foreplay.

03:42.935 --> 03:46.557
Yep, that's me, okay.
Okay, okay! Okay.

03:47.577 --> 03:51.894
And, Mrs. Forman, god, you get
younger every time I see you.

03:52.160 --> 03:54.392
Oh, me too.

03:55.619 --> 03:57.201
Yeah. Yeah,

03:57.541 --> 04:00.941
Yeah. Pinciotti, you
are looking so good.

04:01.089 --> 04:03.247
I'm sorry I've ever
broke up with you?

04:03.277 --> 04:08.073
thing is, see, I got this tendency
to, uh... what's the word?

04:08.102 --> 04:09.463
Smolder?

04:11.162 --> 04:13.405
I think the word
you're looking for is

04:13.425 --> 04:16.295
ditch, bail, run away.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.514
No, no.

04:17.755 --> 04:19.363
Oh, wait, did
you say "bail"?

04:19.517 --> 04:21.077
Yeah, yeah.

04:23.157 --> 04:24.648
So, Casey,

04:25.000 --> 04:28.205
how did we get so lucky
to see you here today

04:28.698 --> 04:30.941
a little bit sweaty?

04:33.712 --> 04:35.955
Well, um, I'm the teacher.

04:37.549 --> 04:38.617
No way.

04:39.228 --> 04:43.373
That's funny. It looks like a normal gym, but
apparently I've stumbled into the mouth of hell.

04:44.958 --> 04:46.930
Yeah, see... The coach

04:46.954 --> 04:51.680
needed someone to fill in, so he called the
best quarterback that Point Place high ever had.

04:51.715 --> 04:54.803
And I figured, you know, the
cheerleaders... they practice in here,

04:54.824 --> 04:58.652
so it'd give me a good chance to see what's
gonna be on the market in a couple years.

05:02.033 --> 05:06.757
I can't believe that you get to decide
whether or not I graduate high school.

05:06.933 --> 05:09.047
Well, look, I tell you what,

05:09.352 --> 05:12.816
you give me one pull-up over there,
I'll tell the school you passed.

05:14.586 --> 05:15.361
Okay.

05:15.397 --> 05:18.320
Okay, let's get this done,
Foreplay. Get over there.

05:18.508 --> 05:21.749
Hey, Pinciotti, you see all these
eighth grade boys checking you out?

05:21.772 --> 05:23.710
No, they're not. Really?

05:28.112 --> 05:29.204
Hi, boys!

05:30.636 --> 05:31.893
All righty,

05:32.468 --> 05:34.135
let's get this done.

05:40.396 --> 05:42.075
Here we go!

05:46.484 --> 05:47.576
Just, uh,

05:47.975 --> 05:49.798
getting in a really
good stretch here.

05:49.829 --> 05:51.932
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me show
you how it's done, Foreplay.

05:51.967 --> 05:54.268
I don't know, man. It's
trickier than it looks.

05:54.292 --> 05:56.441
You rea... oh, you
got it. Good, yeah.

05:57.146 --> 05:59.659
That's what I was going for.

06:01.291 --> 06:04.907
Phew, is it hot
in here or what?

06:10.783 --> 06:11.981
Okay, Fez,

06:12.133 --> 06:15.797
this bedroom's clearly better,
'cause it has its own bathroom, so

06:15.832 --> 06:19.340
I'm go ahead and be the bigger
man and give it to myself.

06:20.362 --> 06:22.863
But I need a room
with its own bathroom.

06:22.894 --> 06:25.225
Otherwise I'm gonna have to walk
through the living room when, you know,

06:25.249 --> 06:27.245
when I want to have
a moment with myself.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.331
That's too bad. I want it.

06:31.355 --> 06:32.411
- I want it.
- Well, I want it!

06:32.447 --> 06:33.351
- I want it!
- I want it!

06:33.374 --> 06:34.795
- I'll kill you!
- What?

06:38.071 --> 06:39.374
Okay, wait, wait.

06:40.408 --> 06:41.794
Fine, you can take it.

06:42.298 --> 06:43.743
I  don't want it anyway.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.445
I was in there earlier,

06:45.668 --> 06:47.206
and I think I heard voices.

06:48.334 --> 06:49.132
Voices?

06:50.306 --> 06:51.968
What kind of voices?

06:52.168 --> 06:56.277
Well, they weren't unfriendly.
They kept saying, "Get out!"

06:58.085 --> 07:00.117
I  don't want
the haunted room.

07:00.608 --> 07:03.015
- Well, I don't want it.
- Well, I don't want it!

07:03.473 --> 07:04.623
Okay, fine.

07:06.044 --> 07:07.676
I'll take the room of death,

07:10.253 --> 07:11.557
But you owe me one.

07:11.721 --> 07:12.977
Thanks, man.

07:17.052 --> 07:18.461
Hi, boys.

07:19.048 --> 07:21.909
I brought you a
housewarming gift...

07:22.061 --> 07:23.470
glass grapes!

07:25.467 --> 07:28.167
Every so often, someone
tries to eat one.

07:28.261 --> 07:30.891
It's a real
conversation-starter.

07:31.950 --> 07:33.253
I remember.

07:36.265 --> 07:40.821
Hmm, you know, it looks like you
might need some help unpacking.

07:40.856 --> 07:41.795
Kitty, no!

07:41.830 --> 07:44.073
Oh, just sit. I'll
just be a minute.

07:44.179 --> 07:47.888
But remember, you are a
guest in these kids' home,

07:47.993 --> 07:51.164
just like they've been a
guest in our home for years.

07:56.513 --> 07:57.370
Yeah.

07:58.626 --> 07:59.847
I'm a guest,

08:00.364 --> 08:03.945
just like they've been
guests in my house.

08:07.418 --> 08:09.238
Hey, that was my program.

08:09.273 --> 08:10.671
Yeah, that's a bummer.

08:12.937 --> 08:13.759
Oops.

08:16.883 --> 08:20.781
What kind of animal just
dumps food on someone's couch?

08:22.214 --> 08:24.151
I'll clean it
up later, dude.

08:26.390 --> 08:28.562
Okay, that's it.
You're going down.

08:29.443 --> 08:31.063
Or I mean,

08:31.580 --> 08:33.001
I'm coming up.

08:33.341 --> 08:37.316
Hey, let's not pretend like this
is gonna happen, okay, Forehead?

08:38.631 --> 08:39.875
Forehead? That's...

08:40.203 --> 08:41.741
come on, man,
that's not even good.

08:41.860 --> 08:44.359
They're all good
to me, Forehead,

08:45.298 --> 08:46.707
but tell you what.

08:46.742 --> 08:49.020
I'll pass you if you
can tell me one thing.

08:49.091 --> 08:52.018
How does a guy that
can't even do one pull-up

08:52.054 --> 08:53.650
get someone like Donna?

08:54.620 --> 08:55.412
Wow.

08:55.990 --> 08:58.363
You know, at least
I'm not the dillhole

08:58.413 --> 09:01.837
who's strutting around the gym with
my whistle thinking I'm all cool

09:01.877 --> 09:06.292
because I'm teaching summer
school P. E. To a bunch of botards.

09:07.643 --> 09:08.441
Man,

09:08.676 --> 09:11.130
I think it's really weird that
you'd say that to me, Forehead,

09:11.177 --> 09:13.957
especially since I was just
about to sign your transcript, but

09:13.993 --> 09:17.456
I don't know. Now it seems
like I've lost my pen.

09:20.425 --> 09:21.364
You didn't lose...

09:23.818 --> 09:25.251
Okay, listen up.

09:25.274 --> 09:27.763
I want to teach you
all a little game.

09:27.810 --> 09:29.337
It's called target.

09:29.630 --> 09:30.358
Yeah!

09:30.382 --> 09:32.295
Ooh, what's target?

09:47.817 --> 09:50.081
All right, all moved in.

09:50.116 --> 09:53.404
Château Kelso is
open for business.

09:54.179 --> 09:56.844
You know, "château"
is german for "mister."

09:57.906 --> 10:00.325
Michael, you should have gotten
the room with the bathroom.

10:00.360 --> 10:03.002
You earned it be being
born better-looking.

10:04.775 --> 10:05.926
Oh, well,

10:06.349 --> 10:09.746
I coulda had it, but Fez said that
there were evil spirits in there,

10:09.781 --> 10:11.367
so I made him take it.

10:13.104 --> 10:14.349
Sucker.

10:16.286 --> 10:18.118
Man, I can't believe
you fell for that,

10:18.141 --> 10:22.354
especially after that time he told you evil spirits
lived in that hot dog, and then you gave him that.

10:24.632 --> 10:26.569
Wait, are you saying
he's tricking me?

10:27.109 --> 10:29.221
Foreigners always lie.

10:32.180 --> 10:35.914
That's how the indians tricked
us into buying New Mexico.

10:38.241 --> 10:40.495
You boys are gonna
need a plumber.

10:40.578 --> 10:43.783
I tried to flush your pillow down
the toilet. It just wouldn't go.

10:45.898 --> 10:47.448
Ooh, matches!

10:55.513 --> 10:56.629
Hi, honey.

10:57.028 --> 10:59.364
How was your first
day of school?

11:01.760 --> 11:04.425
It was awful. Casey's
definitely gonna fail me.

11:04.454 --> 11:07.119
Oh, that doesn't
sound like my Casey.

11:09.926 --> 11:12.133
I mean, the world's Casey.

11:13.225 --> 11:17.335
Man, it's like I finally figured out what I want to do
with my life, and now I might never be able to do it,

11:17.370 --> 11:20.452
and might I add, through
no fault of my own.

11:20.631 --> 11:23.619
Eric, the last time you used the phrase
"through no fault of my own" was when you said,

11:23.651 --> 11:25.591
"Donna, your cat's dead

11:27.520 --> 11:29.064
"through no
fault of my own,"

11:29.956 --> 11:33.408
which I later found out meant,
"Donna, I ran over your cat."

11:34.301 --> 11:37.563
What did you do in class?
Were you being a porky mouth?

11:39.207 --> 11:40.017
What?

11:41.179 --> 11:43.305
No! A little bit, yeah.

11:44.063 --> 11:46.142
Well, there's only
one thing to do.

11:47.328 --> 11:52.597
I'm gonna have to put on some
lipstick and go apologize to Casey.

11:55.098 --> 11:58.524
Fez, you made up all that
stuff about the room!

11:59.417 --> 12:01.554
And I want the room,
so give it back!

12:01.918 --> 12:03.668
- You give it back!
- You give it back!

12:03.692 --> 12:05.453
- You give it back!
- You give it back!

12:10.208 --> 12:11.148
Hi, Casey.

12:11.654 --> 12:12.406
Hey.

12:13.204 --> 12:15.294
Look,  I wanted to
talk to you about Eric.

12:15.494 --> 12:16.292
Who?

12:18.324 --> 12:19.404
Foreplay.

12:19.827 --> 12:21.447
Oh, yeah.

12:21.658 --> 12:24.295
Look, I want to know if you can just
go ahead and let him get his diploma,

12:24.342 --> 12:26.454
because it's really
important to him...

12:26.689 --> 12:27.969
and me.

12:28.662 --> 12:31.773
There might be one way I
can pass the little guy.

12:32.114 --> 12:36.194
You know, all you gotta do is, you
know, just go out with me on a date.

12:36.617 --> 12:38.319
Casey, I'm with Eric!

12:38.460 --> 12:39.282
Who?

12:42.005 --> 12:43.144
I'm not saying it again.

12:43.179 --> 12:46.549
Okay, come on, one date! 'Cause
I'm still trying to figure out

12:46.584 --> 12:49.003
why I ever broke
up with a blonde.

12:52.443 --> 12:54.105
I was a redhead then.

12:55.537 --> 12:58.027
Man, I gotta start
paying attention.

13:07.448 --> 13:08.775
So get this.

13:09.221 --> 13:11.123
I went down to the
gym to talk to Casey,

13:11.158 --> 13:14.692
and he said that the only way he'd pass
you is if I'd go out on a date with him.

13:16.716 --> 13:17.479
What?

13:18.266 --> 13:20.508
Oh, thank you,
Donna, thank you!

13:22.716 --> 13:24.900
So you'd let me
go out with him?

13:24.935 --> 13:27.520
Well, Donna, if you
really loved me, I mean,

13:29.939 --> 13:31.336
you'd date other men.

13:32.581 --> 13:33.567
Get bent!

13:37.587 --> 13:39.971
Now if she really loved
me, she'd date other women.

13:47.702 --> 13:53.127
Okay, the competition for who gets the better
bedroom is gonna be based on the miss america pageant.

13:54.219 --> 13:55.886
Ooh, I'll be miss texas.

13:58.670 --> 14:00.431
That bitch always wins.

14:01.758 --> 14:05.609
Okay, the first event is the
talent portion of the competition.

14:05.868 --> 14:06.525
Okay.

14:08.398 --> 14:09.219
Judges,

14:09.830 --> 14:13.458
I present you with
a dramatic scene

14:13.552 --> 14:17.133
from the major motion
picture "The Godfather."

14:24.344 --> 14:28.536
Aah! there's an
entire horse in my bed!

14:28.947 --> 14:32.793
Why would you do this,
godfather?! Why?!

14:35.071 --> 14:37.126
And then the horse says...

14:37.396 --> 14:40.589
"Let this be a warning."

14:43.196 --> 14:45.169
The horse doesn't
talk, Kelso.

14:46.801 --> 14:49.771
Oh, yeah, I was
thinking of "jaws."

14:49.853 --> 14:51.990
aah, look at my jaws!

15:02.857 --> 15:03.949
Fez, you're up.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.152
I think we're gonna give
this round to the foreign kid.

15:42.649 --> 15:44.199
I just ran into Donna.

15:44.234 --> 15:46.124
Oh, was she on a
date with Casey?

15:49.295 --> 15:52.289
No, and she doesn't
seem too happy with you.

15:52.524 --> 15:54.177
I don't know
why she's so mad.

15:54.917 --> 15:57.711
Well, you'll often find
as you go through life

15:57.746 --> 16:01.363
that when you try to turn your
girlfriend into a prostitute,

16:02.145 --> 16:03.918
she gets cranky.

16:05.174 --> 16:06.524
Okay, but, dad,

16:06.607 --> 16:09.507
passing P. E. Is all
that's standing between me

16:09.612 --> 16:11.186
and the rest of my life.

16:11.209 --> 16:15.939
You're lucky this table is standing
between my foot and your ass.

16:19.402 --> 16:21.829
Now you go down there with
Donna and do a pull-up

16:21.864 --> 16:26.244
and earn the respect of that
woman who inexplicably loves you!

16:27.254 --> 16:29.308
You know what? You're
right. I gotta do this.

16:30.682 --> 16:32.327
I can do this.

16:32.762 --> 16:35.756
I just gotta be like
Luke in "Star Wars."

16:39.314 --> 16:42.296
I just have to really
believe that I can.

16:43.813 --> 16:46.443
Yeah, but I don't believe I can,
so this is nothing like that.

16:48.052 --> 16:49.731
Any tricks to
doing a pull-up?

16:49.766 --> 16:50.471
Yes.

16:51.222 --> 16:52.124
You pull...

16:54.860 --> 16:55.635
up.

16:57.220 --> 16:58.394
Thanks, Obi-Wan.

17:04.445 --> 17:05.137
Eric,

17:05.479 --> 17:07.029
what are we doing here?

17:07.064 --> 17:09.635
You gonna make me sell a
kidney so you can pass math?

17:11.150 --> 17:13.463
No, we're here, because
I'm a man, damn it!

17:13.498 --> 17:14.731
Hey, buddy,

17:15.060 --> 17:17.467
guess what. You're not
taking my girlfriend out.

17:17.502 --> 17:23.078
Guess why. 'Cause I'm about to pass gym fair
and square on the basis of my own strength.

17:25.085 --> 17:26.070
Sidebar.

17:27.954 --> 17:29.034
What are you doing?

17:29.117 --> 17:30.890
I'm doing a pull-up, woman.

17:32.674 --> 17:35.903
Wow, it looks like somebody really
had their wheaties this morning.

17:36.185 --> 17:37.052
Actually,

17:37.650 --> 17:39.435
I had cocoa puffs,

17:40.527 --> 17:42.723
so I'm cuckoo, man, cuckoo!

17:45.682 --> 17:46.457
Donna,

17:46.745 --> 17:47.966
stand back,

17:48.448 --> 17:49.904
mostly because I'm gonna be

17:50.209 --> 17:51.641
kicking my legs a lot.

17:55.915 --> 17:57.054
You can do it, Eric.

17:57.101 --> 17:59.769
Never gonna
happen, Foreplay.

18:00.709 --> 18:02.519
Foreplay,
Foreplay, Foreplay!

18:04.231 --> 18:06.157
It's not "Foreplay,"

18:06.847 --> 18:08.796
it's Forman!

18:10.804 --> 18:12.436
Eric, you did it!

18:12.506 --> 18:14.232
Wow, congratulations.

18:14.279 --> 18:16.252
So we going out or what?

18:16.602 --> 18:20.934
Look, stay away from my girl, okay,
Casey Kelso? Or wait, maybe I should say

18:21.028 --> 18:21.968
Casey

18:22.249 --> 18:23.682
Smellso.

18:24.903 --> 18:26.380
Smellso?

18:26.744 --> 18:27.554
Wow,

18:27.989 --> 18:29.926
that's really cold, Forman.

18:30.325 --> 18:33.519
You know, I'm just gonna go
sign your transcript, 'cause

18:33.989 --> 18:36.381
I don't think I want to
hang out anymore, okay?

18:38.213 --> 18:40.667
Eric, I am so proud of you.

18:41.524 --> 18:43.062
I'd hug you back, but,

18:44.025 --> 18:45.856
well, I can't move my arms.

18:48.869 --> 18:49.797
We're back.

18:50.912 --> 18:56.311
I told Red he had to fix the very unsanitary
thing he did with a pillow in your bathroom.

18:59.543 --> 19:02.630
So we're gonna have to skip
the swimsuit competition,

19:02.657 --> 19:05.853
because Fez won't promise
not to show us his wee-wee.

19:08.401 --> 19:10.597
So we're gonna go
right into interview.

19:10.714 --> 19:14.577
Each of you will have to answer the question,
"Why do you deserve the better room?"

19:14.917 --> 19:16.385
Michael, you go first.

19:17.521 --> 19:18.350
Okay.

19:20.929 --> 19:21.622
Well,

19:22.491 --> 19:23.291
judges,

19:26.039 --> 19:28.810
you may look in there
and see just a room,

19:30.125 --> 19:33.412
but I see a place where
I can raise my daughter

19:33.730 --> 19:35.078
and watch her grow

19:36.146 --> 19:36.910
and

19:37.614 --> 19:39.352
create memories

19:39.634 --> 19:41.207
until the day that

19:41.289 --> 19:43.347
I see her walk
out that door.

19:45.954 --> 19:48.830
And then through the
living room here and

19:50.134 --> 19:51.541
out the main door.

19:54.370 --> 19:55.016
Oh!

19:56.860 --> 19:59.020
Michael, that's
really beautiful.

19:59.537 --> 20:01.707
Yeah, Kelso, real nice.

20:05.288 --> 20:07.695
Let me tell you a
story about a young boy

20:08.717 --> 20:10.466
who dreamt of one day

20:10.677 --> 20:12.039
being in america

20:13.883 --> 20:15.515
in a room just like that.

20:16.537 --> 20:19.178
And with a tear in his
eye, he said, he said...

20:25.853 --> 20:27.039
Which means,

20:27.638 --> 20:28.542
"I want it.

20:31.601 --> 20:32.599
"I want it.

20:35.523 --> 20:36.497
"I want it."

20:39.210 --> 20:41.887
Well, now I vote they
both get the room.

20:42.918 --> 20:45.078
I guess the only
way to solve this

20:45.760 --> 20:47.568
is a footrace
to the room.

20:48.225 --> 20:48.951
Go!

20:49.338 --> 20:50.277
It's mine!

20:51.111 --> 20:54.986
Ha ha! I got here first!
The room is mine!

20:56.007 --> 20:58.320
Gross! Old people sex!

21:03.354 --> 21:06.812
Red, you said you
locked the door!

21:08.596 --> 21:09.735
Sorry, dudes.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.040
The room's yours.

21:24.056 --> 21:25.347
100!

21:26.052 --> 21:27.109
You know,

21:27.161 --> 21:30.848
I bet we could make it to 200 if
that shirt wasn't weighing you down.

21:30.895 --> 21:34.476
Well, uh, the only way the
shirt's coming off is if I get a

21:34.511 --> 21:37.329
kiss from the best-looking
lady in Point Place.

21:37.364 --> 21:40.116
Well, bring it
in, dreamboat!

21:41.748 --> 21:43.556
Oh, Casey!

21:44.225 --> 21:45.317
"Oh, Casey"?

21:45.352 --> 21:48.247
Oh, Casey you see

21:48.282 --> 21:50.642
by the dawn's early light

21:50.677 --> 21:53.801
I just had the most
patriotic dream.
