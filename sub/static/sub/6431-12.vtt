00:01.075 --> 00:02.785
Previously on
<i>Warehouse 13...</i>

00:02.810 --> 00:04.945
You are guardian now.

00:04.970 --> 00:06.170
Collodi's Bracelet.

00:06.195 --> 00:07.987
I think it fell
into the hands of a young boy.

00:08.012 --> 00:09.212
His name's Walter Sykes.

00:09.963 --> 00:11.985
The bracelet gave him control
of his own body,

00:12.010 --> 00:13.210
enabling him to walk.

00:13.235 --> 00:16.230
That young boy is now
the man who is attacking us.

00:16.254 --> 00:17.685
I know who's working for him.

00:17.710 --> 00:19.115
A guy by the name of Marcus.

00:19.140 --> 00:21.690
He just walked away
from a five-story fall.

00:21.715 --> 00:22.915
Why can't I move.

00:22.940 --> 00:24.729
Because I'm controlling
your body now.

00:25.164 --> 00:26.364
There are things
that you don't know.

00:26.389 --> 00:27.589
About the Regents,
about Jane.

00:27.614 --> 00:28.814
I am undercover.

00:28.839 --> 00:30.039
No!

00:47.088 --> 00:48.054
Hey.

00:48.122 --> 00:50.891
I, uh, I told Artie.

00:50.958 --> 00:53.727
So the Regents are going
to send someone to get--

00:57.565 --> 01:02.269
for Steve.

01:02.336 --> 01:04.205
Pete?

01:05.473 --> 01:07.375
How could this happen?
It's--

01:12.414 --> 01:13.348
Claudia?

01:13.415 --> 01:14.616
Listen to me.

01:14.683 --> 01:16.817
We need you to hack
into that laptop, okay?

01:16.885 --> 01:18.753
There could be
something there that--

01:18.821 --> 01:20.421
Claude, listen to me.

01:20.489 --> 01:22.689
We need to find Sykes, right?

01:22.757 --> 01:23.957
We need to find him

01:24.025 --> 01:25.658
and we need to stop him.

01:25.726 --> 01:26.959
Claudia?

01:27.027 --> 01:29.795
Myka.

01:29.863 --> 01:30.829
Yeah?

01:30.897 --> 01:32.631
Steve is dead.

01:32.699 --> 01:34.967
How can you just be
business as usual?

01:35.034 --> 01:37.269
Because if I don't,

01:37.336 --> 01:40.105
I will lose it.

01:40.173 --> 01:41.974
So you need to help me.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:52.686 --> 01:54.387
I'll stay with him.

02:12.208 --> 02:14.575
They ran a fat man
on the memory.

02:14.643 --> 02:16.010
What's a fat man?

02:16.077 --> 02:18.245
Fat man and little boy.
It's a deletion program.

02:18.313 --> 02:20.013
It's a hacker nuclear bomb.

02:20.081 --> 02:22.181
This hard drive is a crater.

02:28.354 --> 02:31.089
This was for nothing.

02:39.533 --> 02:42.302
Sykes needed H.G.
for something.

02:42.369 --> 02:43.837
We need to find him.

02:43.904 --> 02:44.738
Oh, we're gonna find him.

02:44.805 --> 02:47.642
And when we find him...

02:47.709 --> 02:49.811
We're gonna get payback.

02:58.353 --> 03:01.089
You're not too talkative,
Ms. Wells.

03:01.157 --> 03:02.824
Penny for your thoughts?

03:02.891 --> 03:05.426
You killed that young man
in cold blood.

03:05.493 --> 03:07.194
Really?

03:07.262 --> 03:10.497
What temperature
was your blood when you killed?

03:10.565 --> 03:12.131
'Cause you got a bigger body
count than I do.

03:12.199 --> 03:13.733
And I'm seriously considering

03:13.801 --> 03:16.469
adding one more to that list.

03:16.537 --> 03:17.504
Go ahead.

03:18.940 --> 03:20.774
Go ahead.

03:20.842 --> 03:21.742
Go ahead.

03:21.810 --> 03:23.110
Go on.

03:24.813 --> 03:28.650
Kill me.

03:28.718 --> 03:31.820
Cecil B. Demille's riding crop.

03:31.888 --> 03:32.988
Look at that.

03:33.056 --> 03:36.190
Lets my mind control your body.

03:36.258 --> 03:37.926
It's pretty damn cool,
don't you think?

03:40.729 --> 03:41.996
What do you want from me?

03:42.064 --> 03:43.364
Some advice.

03:43.432 --> 03:46.634
I'd strongly recommend
a good psychologist.

03:51.305 --> 03:53.839
Advice on what?

03:53.907 --> 03:57.643
Opening a certain lock.

03:57.711 --> 04:01.147
According to this,

04:01.215 --> 04:03.115
you got an old friend
who taught you

04:03.183 --> 04:04.317
how to do it, right?

04:04.384 --> 04:05.818
Something named Caturanga.

04:05.886 --> 04:07.721
Ms. Wells?

04:12.961 --> 04:15.062
What do you smell?

04:15.129 --> 04:18.064
Ms. Wells?

04:18.132 --> 04:20.298
What do you smell?

04:20.367 --> 04:21.500
Apples?

04:21.567 --> 04:23.936
Yes. You do.

04:24.004 --> 04:26.639
Most people do not
smell the apples.

04:26.707 --> 04:28.307
The Warehouse likes you.

04:28.375 --> 04:30.710
Buildings do not have
personal affinities, sir.

04:30.777 --> 04:33.479
This is not,
as you will discover,

04:33.547 --> 04:36.047
just a building,
Miss Wells.

04:36.115 --> 04:39.718
Welcome to Warehouse 12.

04:39.786 --> 04:41.019
I am Caturanga.

04:41.087 --> 04:42.354
And you're in charge here?

04:42.422 --> 04:44.390
Oh, no! My job is to teach

04:44.457 --> 04:46.792
and to solve puzzles,

04:46.860 --> 04:47.760
we shall say.

04:47.828 --> 04:49.161
What kind of puzzles?

04:49.229 --> 04:51.931
Many sorts,
and to design them, too.

04:51.998 --> 04:56.769
Sometimes to house a dangerous
artifact, like that one.

04:56.837 --> 04:58.004
Uh-uh-ah.

04:58.072 --> 05:00.740
Sometimes, to brew
the perfect cup of tea.

05:00.808 --> 05:02.008
This is England,

05:02.076 --> 05:04.077
so a good cup of tea
is not hard to find.

05:04.145 --> 05:05.078
Yes,

05:05.146 --> 05:07.414
but...

05:07.481 --> 05:10.150
The perfect cup of tea--

05:10.217 --> 05:11.618
that's a puzzle.

05:12.821 --> 05:13.854
I've read some
of your stories.

05:13.922 --> 05:15.789
You are very gifted.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.392
I thought my imagination
knew no boundary,

05:18.459 --> 05:19.393
but to stand here,

05:19.460 --> 05:22.496
amidst this wonderment--

05:23.565 --> 05:27.034
There's always more to learn.

05:27.102 --> 05:28.836
I will teach you.

05:31.039 --> 05:33.274
I'll die before I help you.

05:33.342 --> 05:35.910
Oh, you'll help me.

05:35.978 --> 05:38.213
Whether you live or die
is entirely up to you.

05:53.416 --> 05:55.517
It doesn't get easier,
does it?

05:55.585 --> 05:57.252
To lose a fellow Agent.

05:57.320 --> 05:59.221
I've lost fellow agents...

05:59.288 --> 06:01.289
partners,

06:01.357 --> 06:02.857
friends,

06:02.925 --> 06:04.426
Steve...

06:04.494 --> 06:06.395
he was my responsibility.

06:06.462 --> 06:11.833
You might have told me
that he was undercover.

06:11.901 --> 06:13.201
Are you angry?

06:13.268 --> 06:14.969
Does it matter?

06:15.037 --> 06:16.904
There's always a cost.

06:26.047 --> 06:27.148
What is Sykes planning?

06:27.215 --> 06:28.516
And how are
we going to stop him?

06:28.584 --> 06:30.585
The Regents are
assembling to regroup.

06:30.653 --> 06:34.356
I'll keep you posted.

06:34.423 --> 06:37.192
The Warehouse has
always endured, Arthur.

06:43.366 --> 06:45.400
Remember this watch?

06:45.468 --> 06:47.202
Used to argue over it.

06:47.270 --> 06:49.772
I think you should have it.

06:49.840 --> 06:51.907
Good luck, old friend.

06:51.975 --> 06:53.542
I imagine you're
going to need it.

07:37.887 --> 07:39.754
You guys all right?

07:45.627 --> 07:46.861
We are...

07:46.929 --> 07:50.832
On the other side of the world
from all right.

07:50.900 --> 07:52.133
How did they do it?

07:52.201 --> 07:54.403
An injection.

07:54.470 --> 07:57.072
They made it look
like a heart attack.

07:57.140 --> 07:58.707
Found this stuff on him.

07:58.775 --> 08:00.743
I didn't even know
the guy smoked.

08:00.811 --> 08:02.812
He didn't.

08:02.879 --> 08:06.549
His father was a chain smoker.
Steve hated smoking.

08:09.853 --> 08:12.289
That's my boy.

08:12.356 --> 08:14.758
What is that?

08:14.826 --> 08:16.627
Steve doing his job.

08:23.501 --> 08:26.069
Hey, guys.

08:26.137 --> 08:27.304
Bad news is
if you're watching this,

08:27.371 --> 08:30.507
I'm probably screwed.

08:30.575 --> 08:33.142
So, I'll keep it short.

08:33.210 --> 08:35.410
Still nothing
on Sykes' end game.

08:35.479 --> 08:37.714
He plays it
pretty close to the vest.

08:37.780 --> 08:38.948
But I can tell you
that he's made

08:39.015 --> 08:40.082
travel arrangements
to Hong Kong.

08:40.150 --> 08:41.384
I don't know why.

08:41.452 --> 08:42.818
But it's definitely
not a pleasure trip.

08:42.885 --> 08:44.220
There's one other thing.

08:44.288 --> 08:46.389
Sykes' number two--
Marcus Diamond--

08:46.457 --> 08:47.524
the guy who doesn't die,

08:47.592 --> 08:48.992
something's strange about him.

08:49.060 --> 08:50.560
He gets this look
when Sykes brings out

08:50.628 --> 08:51.594
this wooden box.

08:51.662 --> 08:52.562
It's probably an artifact.

08:52.630 --> 08:55.098
Artie, you should check it out.

08:55.166 --> 08:57.033
Agent Steve Jinks signing off.

08:57.101 --> 08:59.202
Good luck, you guys.

08:59.270 --> 09:01.672
Claude.

09:01.739 --> 09:06.609
Keep the faith.

09:08.245 --> 09:10.113
Good work, Jinxy.

09:10.180 --> 09:12.248
Indeed.

09:12.315 --> 09:14.416
Agent Jinks may have given us

09:14.484 --> 09:16.752
the final piece to the puzzle.

09:16.819 --> 09:18.287
Why?
What's in Hong Kong?

09:18.354 --> 09:22.023
Something we thought was gone
and buried forever.

09:22.091 --> 09:23.725
Walter Sykes may have uncovered

09:23.792 --> 09:26.628
the ancient Regent Sanctum.

09:36.491 --> 09:37.758
If the Regent Sanctum
was constructed

09:37.826 --> 09:40.128
during the era
of Warehouse 7,

09:40.195 --> 09:43.131
it predates H.G. by centuries.

09:43.198 --> 09:45.066
What does Sykes want with her?

09:45.134 --> 09:46.368
No idea.

09:46.435 --> 09:47.502
All knowledge of the sanctum

09:47.570 --> 09:48.770
was purged
from warehouse records

09:48.838 --> 09:50.139
when it was finally
shut down for good.

09:50.206 --> 09:52.174
That was over 100 years ago.

09:52.242 --> 09:53.242
And...

09:53.310 --> 09:54.610
if it was just
a meeting place,

09:54.677 --> 09:55.911
why would he even care about it?

09:55.978 --> 09:57.479
I got it.
Three tickets to Hong Kong.

09:57.547 --> 09:59.081
Purchased from
Tyler's IP address.

09:59.148 --> 10:00.082
Three?

10:00.149 --> 10:02.117
Sykes, Tyler, Marcus, H.G.?

10:02.185 --> 10:03.952
Somebody did not make that trip.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.120
They're gonna get there
before us.

10:05.188 --> 10:06.355
And he has an advantage.

10:06.423 --> 10:09.292
He knows where it is,
and we don't.

10:09.359 --> 10:10.826
I found this
in the Escher Vault.

10:10.894 --> 10:13.329
It was worn by the Regents
of Warehouse 7.

10:13.397 --> 10:14.730
Claudia?

10:14.798 --> 10:17.066
See if you can get us
the history on this thing.

10:17.134 --> 10:18.100
Wait.

10:18.168 --> 10:19.335
That's the Chinese symbol for...

10:19.402 --> 10:20.836
Aperture.

10:20.904 --> 10:23.539
Aperture could be a facility
that manufactures cameras?

10:23.607 --> 10:25.775
Or a location
that acts as an aperture.

10:25.843 --> 10:27.944
Somewhere, light hits
a certain way.

10:28.011 --> 10:30.079
Oh, how very Indiana Jones.

10:30.146 --> 10:32.081
The roads.
The--the--the roads in--

10:32.148 --> 10:33.082
Roads, I remember--

10:33.149 --> 10:34.083
there's something--

10:34.150 --> 10:36.919
See, the roads kind of--

10:36.987 --> 10:38.721
see that? They connect...

10:38.788 --> 10:39.722
In almost forms a--

10:39.789 --> 10:40.890
Might see the--

10:40.957 --> 10:41.924
You two know
you haven't actually

10:41.992 --> 10:43.493
finished a sentence yet,
right?

10:43.560 --> 10:45.895
Well, the same symbol
that--that means aperture

10:45.963 --> 10:47.697
can also mean eye.

10:47.765 --> 10:48.999
As in...

10:49.067 --> 10:50.300
The eye of Horus.

10:50.368 --> 10:53.937
Now, look, this is
Hong Kong circa...1600.

10:54.004 --> 10:56.272
These roads--the roads today,

10:56.340 --> 10:58.007
are all based on these roads.

10:58.075 --> 11:01.110
And--take a look at this.
Look.

11:01.178 --> 11:02.978
The roads form
an Eye of Horus.

11:03.046 --> 11:04.580
Iris of the eye.

11:04.647 --> 11:05.747
It's a city.
Tai Po.

11:05.815 --> 11:07.249
Good a place to start as any.

11:07.317 --> 11:09.151
We'll, uh, we'll check in
when we get there.

11:12.622 --> 11:14.323
Claudia...

11:14.390 --> 11:15.557
I think it'd be a good idea--

11:15.625 --> 11:19.061
Excuse me.

11:19.129 --> 11:20.964
Claudia?

11:27.806 --> 11:29.941
You have every right
to be angry.

11:30.009 --> 11:32.777
Agents Jinks was a good man.

11:32.845 --> 11:34.479
And what happened was a tragedy.

11:34.546 --> 11:36.047
And?

11:36.114 --> 11:38.148
And what?

11:38.216 --> 11:42.152
And I'm really sorry
I sent him to his death?

11:42.219 --> 11:44.087
Steve died alone.

11:44.154 --> 11:45.521
Cut off from everybody
who had his back.

11:45.589 --> 11:46.522
And for what?

11:46.590 --> 11:47.990
Why?

11:48.058 --> 11:50.058
Agent Jinks did not want
to put any of you at risk.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.660
He volunteered for--

11:51.727 --> 11:53.862
To take down Walter Sykes
for the good of the world.

11:53.930 --> 11:55.430
But let's face it, Jane.

11:55.498 --> 11:57.465
This was never about
the good of the world, was it?

11:57.533 --> 12:01.637
This was about your guilt.

12:01.705 --> 12:03.205
You made Walter Sykes.

12:03.273 --> 12:04.206
No, Claudia.

12:04.274 --> 12:05.975
I tried to prevent Walter Sykes

12:06.043 --> 12:07.277
from being made.

12:07.344 --> 12:08.645
If we had gotten
to the artifact in time--

12:08.712 --> 12:10.847
But you didn't and he became
a psychopathic killer.

12:10.915 --> 12:13.116
And now all you care about
is fixing your mistake,

12:13.184 --> 12:14.684
no matter who gets hurt
or killed along the way.

12:14.752 --> 12:16.385
That's not true!
It's just not--

12:19.856 --> 12:21.290
You're upset.

12:21.357 --> 12:23.058
This is not the time to discuss
whether Agent Jinks was--

12:23.126 --> 12:24.059
Steve!

12:24.127 --> 12:26.761
His name was Steve.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.930
You know,
I see you and the Regents

12:28.998 --> 12:32.533
for what you really are.

12:32.601 --> 12:35.303
Cowards.

12:35.371 --> 12:37.138
Steve was worth
a thousand of you.

12:49.974 --> 12:51.674
This is exactly
where the eye would be,

12:51.742 --> 12:54.310
but maybe it's
just a restaurant.

12:54.378 --> 12:57.180
Then why did I get a vibe
that almost knocked me over?

12:57.248 --> 12:59.949
I'm here in a Chinese
restaurant, Myks.

13:00.017 --> 13:01.485
And I'm not hungry.

13:01.552 --> 13:03.887
I know there's something here.

13:03.955 --> 13:06.591
We--we are at the dead center
of the city,

13:06.658 --> 13:08.426
and--

13:08.493 --> 13:09.460
What?

13:09.528 --> 13:10.762
What is it?

13:10.830 --> 13:14.166
If the sanctum was built
that long ago...

13:14.233 --> 13:16.668
What if the restaurant
isn't the sanctum?

13:19.838 --> 13:21.572
What if it's on top...

13:21.639 --> 13:23.507
of the sanctum?

13:35.920 --> 13:38.622
Well, I would say that
we're in the right place.

13:41.059 --> 13:42.393
What do you got?

13:42.460 --> 13:45.062
Well, I doubt H.G.
and a stock boy

13:45.130 --> 13:46.964
wear the same locket.

13:57.242 --> 13:59.109
Somebody there?

14:14.359 --> 14:15.927
Nothing.

14:15.994 --> 14:17.328
I don't know.

14:17.396 --> 14:21.199
Maybe they realized
it was the wrong place and left.

14:22.367 --> 14:23.334
But...

14:23.402 --> 14:25.369
why do I still have a vibe?

14:25.437 --> 14:28.171
Because H.G. left
that locket as a clue.

14:28.239 --> 14:30.307
I know it.

14:30.375 --> 14:31.275
Pete?

14:31.343 --> 14:32.276
Yeah?

14:32.344 --> 14:33.744
Look at this.

14:33.812 --> 14:35.579
It looks like something swept

14:35.647 --> 14:37.048
across the floor.

14:39.618 --> 14:40.551
What is it?

14:40.619 --> 14:41.552
A--like a--

14:41.619 --> 14:43.887
a door, or...

14:43.955 --> 14:47.391
Opening?

14:47.458 --> 14:49.292
Maybe we can--

14:56.700 --> 14:59.069
the Eye of Horus.

14:59.136 --> 15:00.871
I believe the phrase is

15:00.938 --> 15:02.773
aha.

15:25.831 --> 15:28.566
Please, Mr. Sykes,
don't make me do this.

15:28.634 --> 15:32.470
Tyler, make the move
the lady suggested.

15:32.538 --> 15:34.639
Now.

15:34.706 --> 15:36.073
This is lunacy.

15:36.141 --> 15:37.776
It's not a move.
It's a guess.

15:37.843 --> 15:39.277
I don't care.

15:39.345 --> 15:41.079
We don't know
if we don't play.

15:41.147 --> 15:42.080
Now move that piece.

15:47.153 --> 15:48.821
The first two were wrong.

15:48.888 --> 15:49.821
The third could--

15:49.889 --> 15:53.859
Enough!

15:53.927 --> 15:55.194
Tyler,

15:55.262 --> 15:56.796
what are you waiting for?

15:56.863 --> 15:59.464
Look at those skulls.
They're all cracked in half.

15:59.532 --> 16:01.433
Yeah, I think I see why.

16:06.371 --> 16:07.438
Please, Mr. Sykes.

16:07.506 --> 16:09.473
Don't make him do it.

16:09.541 --> 16:10.707
Tyler,

16:10.775 --> 16:13.243
you got to be in it
to win it.

16:13.310 --> 16:14.744
Now.

16:20.150 --> 16:23.786
Good lad.

16:23.854 --> 16:24.954
Checkmate.

16:28.793 --> 16:31.227
No!

16:34.099 --> 16:35.766
First show's over.

16:35.834 --> 16:37.401
Lattimer and Bering?

16:37.469 --> 16:39.304
Come on down!

16:42.941 --> 16:44.342
Myka, are you all right?

16:44.409 --> 16:45.343
I didn't do that.

16:45.410 --> 16:47.011
No, I'm--I'm fine.

16:47.079 --> 16:48.913
Myka, that's only because
I control where she shot.

16:48.980 --> 16:50.681
Next time, her aim is going
to be a lot better.

16:50.749 --> 16:51.783
Okay?
Let's go, guys.

16:51.850 --> 16:53.718
Guns on the floor, please?

16:57.122 --> 16:59.457
Or the next shot is going
to be right between

16:59.524 --> 17:01.358
Ms. Bering's beautiful eyes.

17:23.713 --> 17:24.913
You son of a--

17:26.516 --> 17:28.450
Stop it!

17:28.517 --> 17:29.451
I don't understand.

17:29.518 --> 17:30.952
Why is there a torture device

17:31.020 --> 17:32.187
in the Regent Sanctum?

17:32.255 --> 17:34.455
It's not a torture device,
honey.

17:34.523 --> 17:35.791
It's a lock.

17:35.858 --> 17:38.293
It was invented
by a man named Caturanga.

17:38.361 --> 17:39.527
He was rather the Claudia

17:39.595 --> 17:41.329
of Warehouse 12

17:41.397 --> 17:42.731
and my teacher.

17:42.799 --> 17:45.134
That's why you needed Helena
to open it.

17:45.201 --> 17:48.037
She's the only living person
who knew this...

17:48.105 --> 17:49.539
Caturanga.

17:49.606 --> 17:51.341
See, the pieces are set
so the player's in check.

17:51.408 --> 17:52.342
You win the game,

17:52.409 --> 17:53.677
and the lock opens.

17:53.745 --> 17:54.778
You lose the game,

17:54.846 --> 17:56.280
and your skull opens.

17:56.348 --> 17:58.516
When the Regents shut down
the Sanctum a century ago,

17:58.584 --> 18:01.353
Caturanga designed the lock.

18:01.421 --> 18:03.522
Now, the secret to opening it

18:03.590 --> 18:04.990
is not in the journals.

18:05.058 --> 18:06.725
But he writes a lot about
Ms. Wells, here.

18:06.792 --> 18:08.260
She's his favorite student.

18:08.327 --> 18:09.861
I think she knows about it.

18:09.929 --> 18:11.529
Caturanga taught me
a thousand things,

18:11.597 --> 18:14.164
but I have never seen
the chess lock before.

18:14.232 --> 18:15.666
I don't know how to open it.

18:15.733 --> 18:16.566
I know, and you
clearly demonstrated

18:16.634 --> 18:17.567
with young Tyler, here.

18:17.635 --> 18:18.601
You did that.

18:18.669 --> 18:19.936
I tried to stop you!

18:20.004 --> 18:20.937
I swear it.

18:21.004 --> 18:22.071
You know what?

18:22.139 --> 18:24.707
Maybe I used
the wrong incentive.

18:24.775 --> 18:25.875
No!

18:27.011 --> 18:28.078
Myka!
Myka!

18:30.181 --> 18:33.483
Now that there's somebody
in the chair you care about,

18:33.551 --> 18:36.353
maybe your memory
will come back.

18:49.467 --> 18:50.534
What is that?

18:50.602 --> 18:52.235
A gift from
a former employer.

18:52.303 --> 18:54.804
What do you want from me?
I'm just an innkeeper.

18:54.872 --> 18:59.408
Oh, we both know you're
more than that, don't we?

18:59.476 --> 19:01.410
If you think
that I'm gonna help you

19:01.478 --> 19:02.578
break into the warehouse,

19:02.646 --> 19:04.213
you're in for a surprise.

19:04.281 --> 19:05.648
No.

19:05.715 --> 19:07.750
No, you see,
it's you people

19:07.818 --> 19:09.652
who are gonna be surprised.

19:26.840 --> 19:28.774
What is that?

19:28.842 --> 19:31.009
Something's wrong at Leena's.
Pull up the security feed.

19:31.077 --> 19:32.878
Way ahead of you.

19:37.716 --> 19:40.584
It's him.

19:40.652 --> 19:42.186
Leena.

19:42.253 --> 19:43.354
Ah!

19:43.421 --> 19:46.757
All right, all right.

19:46.825 --> 19:49.427
If we unlock this thing,
what are we going to find?

19:49.494 --> 19:50.961
You'll see.

19:51.029 --> 19:53.097
Have you considered that we
might be unlocking an artifact

19:53.165 --> 19:56.067
deemed too dangerous to be kept
in Warehouse 7?

19:56.135 --> 19:57.569
She's right, you know.

19:57.637 --> 19:59.138
The Regents must have had
a reason to keep people out.

19:59.205 --> 20:00.572
Don't tell me
about the Regents

20:00.640 --> 20:01.974
or the reasons, okay?

20:02.042 --> 20:03.176
You have one choice.

20:03.243 --> 20:05.078
Open the lock,

20:05.146 --> 20:06.112
or she's gonna die.

20:06.180 --> 20:07.714
Now, how do we beat it?

20:07.782 --> 20:09.482
This was Caturanga's passion.

20:09.550 --> 20:11.417
We played every day for years.

20:11.485 --> 20:12.751
You beat him all the time?

20:12.819 --> 20:14.753
Not once.

20:16.322 --> 20:17.856
Oh, great.

20:17.924 --> 20:18.924
All right.

20:18.992 --> 20:23.195
Time to make a move.

20:23.263 --> 20:27.598
With Tyler, I--I chose
the King's gambit.

20:27.666 --> 20:29.901
Caturanga would have
expected that.

20:29.969 --> 20:33.705
Perhaps--

20:33.773 --> 20:37.376
yes, perhaps
the--the Dragon's variant.

20:37.443 --> 20:38.710
Myka,

20:38.778 --> 20:41.580
King's Knight...

20:41.648 --> 20:43.515
to E-6.

20:56.963 --> 20:58.330
Check.

21:02.468 --> 21:04.670
You're distracting
the player, Pete.

21:11.845 --> 21:14.113
Queen's Bishop...

21:14.181 --> 21:17.049
to h-4.

21:30.364 --> 21:31.631
Check.

21:34.468 --> 21:36.335
I don't know what else to do!

21:36.403 --> 21:37.403
Helena.

21:37.471 --> 21:38.904
Continuing.

21:38.972 --> 21:40.306
Sorry, Myka.

21:40.373 --> 21:42.208
Helena, listen to me.

21:42.276 --> 21:44.944
I am not going to die
here today, okay?

21:45.012 --> 21:47.013
Because you are going
to take a breath,

21:47.081 --> 21:49.682
and you're gonna save my life.

21:49.750 --> 21:52.151
This isn't
what I signed up for.

21:52.219 --> 21:54.586
These Regents of yours are
gravely mistaken

21:54.654 --> 21:56.888
if they think I shall be
carrying around this.

21:56.956 --> 21:58.756
The Webley Mark One
.450 caliber,

21:58.824 --> 22:01.659
standard issue of the Royal Navy
and police constabularies.

22:01.726 --> 22:02.693
A fine weapon.

22:02.761 --> 22:03.694
Guns have no place

22:03.762 --> 22:06.463
in a civilized society, sir.

22:06.531 --> 22:08.165
Now, the Regents
set the rules,

22:08.233 --> 22:09.801
and their rules states

22:09.868 --> 22:12.437
all warehouse agents
must carry a firearm.

22:12.505 --> 22:14.674
But there is always
an alternative to killing.

22:14.741 --> 22:18.177
I agree.

22:18.245 --> 22:21.247
That is not standard issue.

22:21.315 --> 22:22.649
I changed the rules.

22:22.716 --> 22:23.650
Wells,

22:23.717 --> 22:25.118
time for target practice.

22:30.157 --> 22:31.358
Is he dead?

22:31.425 --> 22:33.026
No, no.

22:33.094 --> 22:35.795
Agent McShane
is merely stunned.

22:35.863 --> 22:39.499
When the rules do not
agree with one,

22:39.567 --> 22:43.102
it is sometimes necessary
to change them.

22:43.170 --> 22:44.637
Change the rules.

22:44.705 --> 22:46.139
What?

22:46.206 --> 22:47.674
Change the rules.

22:47.741 --> 22:48.808
Myka,

22:48.876 --> 22:50.043
D-3...

22:50.111 --> 22:51.511
to E-8.

22:51.578 --> 22:52.946
Helena, I-I--

22:53.014 --> 22:54.849
I can't move my pawn like that.

22:54.916 --> 22:56.017
I know.

22:56.084 --> 22:57.919
Change the rules.

23:15.973 --> 23:17.440
Checkmate.

23:20.544 --> 23:24.814
Whatever it is,
I think it's about to open.

23:28.652 --> 23:30.486
Do it.

23:42.201 --> 23:43.935
Artie, what's that?

23:44.003 --> 23:44.970
Black Barty's Cannon.

23:45.037 --> 23:46.238
Black Barty?

23:46.305 --> 23:47.573
Black Barty was one
of the most successful

23:47.640 --> 23:48.974
pirate captains
of the golden age.

23:49.041 --> 23:50.642
And his cannon from his ship

23:50.710 --> 23:54.179
was rumored to have
artifact-augmented firepower.

23:54.246 --> 23:55.680
Are you telling me
that Walter Sykes' plan

23:55.747 --> 23:57.915
is to fire a cannonball
at the Warehouse?

23:57.983 --> 23:59.249
A cannonball
wouldn't worry me,

23:59.317 --> 24:01.218
but a cannonball
from that cannon?

24:01.286 --> 24:03.286
I'm approaching worry.

24:03.354 --> 24:04.254
I'm not.

24:07.724 --> 24:08.691
What the hell's happening?

24:37.588 --> 24:38.922
What just happened?

24:38.990 --> 24:40.457
The Remati Shackle
sensed an attack

24:40.524 --> 24:43.627
and activated a protective
barrier around the Warehouse.

24:43.694 --> 24:44.628
We're safe.

24:44.695 --> 24:45.761
I gotta get to Leena's.

24:45.829 --> 24:46.963
Once the shackle
is activated,

24:47.030 --> 24:49.198
I'm afraid no one
can get in or out.

24:49.266 --> 24:50.199
Claudia!

24:50.267 --> 24:51.233
I want you to--

24:51.301 --> 24:52.234
Artie,

24:52.302 --> 24:53.936
I have a bad feeling.

24:54.004 --> 24:56.305
I have a bad vibe.

24:56.373 --> 24:58.340
But you said
that nothing could get in

24:58.408 --> 24:59.875
once the barrier was up.

24:59.943 --> 25:01.209
True, but it can't stop

25:01.277 --> 25:03.045
something
that's already inside.

25:26.005 --> 25:29.608
The Regents wanted
to know our vulnerability.

25:29.675 --> 25:32.043
I think we just found it.

25:34.313 --> 25:35.880
Amazing.
The warehouse.

25:41.753 --> 25:43.287
You guys! Run!

25:50.730 --> 25:52.698
Bastard.

25:52.766 --> 25:53.599
No!

26:14.355 --> 26:15.723
No.

26:15.791 --> 26:17.625
They must have shut it down
from the other side.

26:17.692 --> 26:19.393
I hope you don't mind.

26:19.461 --> 26:22.630
I let myself in.

26:28.666 --> 26:31.702
Initiating the barrier
automatically triggered

26:31.769 --> 26:33.303
the emergency exit portal--

26:33.371 --> 26:35.439
To the ancient sanctum.

26:35.507 --> 26:37.240
When the Regents
abandoned the portal,

26:37.308 --> 26:38.608
they locked it up,
but it wasn't enough

26:38.676 --> 26:40.177
just to trigger
on one side.

26:40.245 --> 26:42.513
You had to unlock
the Hong Kong side as well.

26:42.581 --> 26:43.948
Which is why you needed H.G.

26:44.016 --> 26:45.884
You'd have been
proud of her.

26:45.952 --> 26:47.052
She only killed
one guy doing it.

26:47.120 --> 26:49.121
Peter, are you hurt?

26:49.188 --> 26:50.222
No.

26:50.290 --> 26:51.924
A little tired
of this guy, though.

26:51.992 --> 26:53.626
You'll never get
what you want.

26:53.694 --> 26:55.328
Difference of opinion, Jane.

26:55.395 --> 26:57.263
See, I think I'm gonna get
exactly what I want.

26:57.330 --> 26:58.631
Artie, no!

27:00.799 --> 27:01.699
Oh!

27:01.767 --> 27:02.901
Artie!

27:02.968 --> 27:04.135
That'll be
your only warning.

27:04.203 --> 27:05.536
Play nice.

27:05.604 --> 27:07.004
Artie, I'm sorry.

27:07.072 --> 27:08.272
It's his crop.

27:08.339 --> 27:09.606
It's got wicked mojo.
Are you okay?

27:09.674 --> 27:11.341
I've been better.

27:11.409 --> 27:12.676
Why don't you just kill us?

27:12.744 --> 27:14.578
I'm going to.

27:14.645 --> 27:16.580
But we're going to go find
the Collodi Bracelet, first.

27:16.647 --> 27:17.881
And this time, Jane,

27:17.949 --> 27:21.884
you're going to watch your son
hand it to me.

27:21.952 --> 27:25.654
There's gotta be another way
to open this. I just--

27:25.722 --> 27:27.590
I have to think.

27:29.726 --> 27:31.927
Myka,

27:31.995 --> 27:34.696
I'm sorry.

27:34.764 --> 27:37.165
About what?

27:37.233 --> 27:38.867
You should have destroyed
the Janus coin

27:38.935 --> 27:40.202
the moment you found it.

27:40.269 --> 27:42.037
Then I wouldn't have caused
all of this.

27:42.104 --> 27:43.838
I wish that you would stop
doing that.

27:43.906 --> 27:44.806
Doing what?

27:44.873 --> 27:46.140
You're not the bad guy, okay?

27:46.208 --> 27:47.641
I believed in you,
and I was right.

27:47.709 --> 27:49.877
So get off your--your cross,

27:49.944 --> 27:53.546
and help me figure this out.

27:54.782 --> 27:56.984
Righty-ho, then.

27:57.051 --> 27:58.385
Old times,

27:58.453 --> 27:59.620
Wells and Bering,

27:59.688 --> 28:01.656
solving puzzles,
saving the day.

28:01.724 --> 28:03.558
Bering and Wells.

28:06.329 --> 28:09.164
There are consequences
to using the Collodi Bracelet.

28:09.232 --> 28:12.000
There were consequences
to not using it.

28:12.068 --> 28:13.902
It's a part of me.

28:13.970 --> 28:17.006
I close my eyes,
and I can see it.

28:17.074 --> 28:18.240
Without it,
there's a hole in my soul.

28:18.308 --> 28:19.708
That's what it does to you.

28:19.776 --> 28:20.743
It's not real.

28:20.810 --> 28:22.144
It's not a real need.

28:22.212 --> 28:25.047
It is real to me!

28:28.050 --> 28:29.150
Oh, no.

28:29.218 --> 28:30.485
Or did you not know that,
Jane?

28:30.552 --> 28:33.120
Wearing the bracelet creates
a insatiable longing--

28:33.188 --> 28:34.955
It hardens your heart.
It darkens your soul.

28:35.023 --> 28:36.724
And if we let you
keep the bracelet,

28:36.792 --> 28:38.226
you never would have
been able to love,

28:38.293 --> 28:39.394
or be loved.

28:39.461 --> 28:40.761
If you did everything right,

28:40.829 --> 28:42.163
then why are we here?

28:42.230 --> 28:43.664
We didn't get to you
soon enough.

28:43.732 --> 28:46.301
The seeds of darkness
had already taken root.

28:46.369 --> 28:47.969
You've killed
a lot of people, Walter.

28:48.037 --> 28:50.038
But I take responsibility
for that.

28:50.106 --> 28:51.406
Oh, that's big of you,
Jane.

28:51.474 --> 28:52.741
It's not too late.

28:52.809 --> 28:55.477
We could still try to save you.

28:55.545 --> 28:57.012
Mom, please.

28:57.080 --> 28:58.614
I don't think
you're going to hurt me.

28:58.681 --> 29:00.982
I think you understand
what I'm saying.

29:01.050 --> 29:04.385
I think you know there's been
enough damage done.

29:04.453 --> 29:06.087
I think you're ready
to stop this.

29:06.155 --> 29:09.790
But, Jane,
then you'd have solace.

29:09.858 --> 29:13.260
I want you to feel
the guilt and the pain.

29:13.328 --> 29:14.661
Like I have.

29:14.729 --> 29:16.296
You should have opted
for the opportunity

29:16.364 --> 29:18.699
I just gave you.

29:18.766 --> 29:21.635
I will take the risk.

29:21.703 --> 29:24.538
And the bracelet.

29:24.606 --> 29:26.440
Pete?

29:36.283 --> 29:38.084
Marcus.

29:38.152 --> 29:39.986
I have it.

29:40.054 --> 29:41.487
Go ahead.

29:44.826 --> 29:45.726
You'll never win.

29:45.794 --> 29:46.961
Pete and Myka and the others--

29:47.029 --> 29:48.095
they'll fight back.

29:48.163 --> 29:51.733
Possibly.

29:53.135 --> 29:55.036
But you would have had
a heart attack by then.

29:55.103 --> 29:57.071
Put that syringe down,
Mr. Diamond.

30:00.041 --> 30:00.974
I'm impressed.

30:01.041 --> 30:02.175
Imagine my delight.

30:02.242 --> 30:04.644
Drop it, please.

30:10.550 --> 30:12.484
It's about time.

30:12.551 --> 30:13.585
I didn't think
you'd let me kill her.

30:13.653 --> 30:15.220
And I knew you'd wait for me.

30:15.288 --> 30:16.555
You never should have come.

30:16.622 --> 30:19.258
I made you a promise
a long time ago.

30:19.325 --> 30:21.560
I honor my commitments.

30:21.628 --> 30:25.163
This is Marcus Diamond,
former Baltimore City Detective.

30:25.231 --> 30:26.932
Shot in the line of duty.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.934
Three times.

30:29.002 --> 30:29.935
Dead center.

30:30.003 --> 30:31.270
And you lived?

30:31.338 --> 30:32.938
Bullets are
still in his heart.

30:33.006 --> 30:34.106
If you know
that much about me,

30:34.174 --> 30:35.441
you know
that metal won't kill me.

30:35.509 --> 30:36.642
Yes.

30:36.710 --> 30:38.377
But it will cause you
unending pain.

30:38.445 --> 30:40.946
You have no idea
what's about to happen.

30:41.013 --> 30:42.614
Oh, but I do.

30:49.187 --> 30:52.423
Finally.

30:52.490 --> 30:54.358
Right where it belongs.

31:09.342 --> 31:11.710
You got what you wanted.

31:11.778 --> 31:12.711
Get out.

31:12.779 --> 31:14.546
No, this is just step one.

31:14.614 --> 31:15.814
Before you die,

31:15.882 --> 31:17.282
I want you to know
what it feels like

31:17.350 --> 31:18.350
when something you love

31:18.417 --> 31:20.251
is ripped away from you.

31:24.957 --> 31:26.223
No, please.

31:33.638 --> 31:34.571
I'm responsible.

31:34.639 --> 31:37.141
Kill me.

31:38.276 --> 31:39.243
Myka,

31:39.311 --> 31:40.244
thank God!

31:40.312 --> 31:43.548
Come on!

31:44.917 --> 31:45.850
You guys, circle around.

31:45.918 --> 31:47.519
Don't let him in the portal.

31:47.586 --> 31:50.454
Myka!

31:50.522 --> 31:51.822
H.G.!

31:51.890 --> 31:53.590
Rigging rope from
the <i>Mary Celeste.</i>

31:53.658 --> 31:54.758
Hang on.

31:54.825 --> 31:56.226
No, Myka, don't--

31:57.261 --> 31:58.961
Touch the rope?

31:59.029 --> 32:01.964
I imagine it's
the rest of that sentence.

32:04.401 --> 32:06.469
If you pull at it,
it only gets tighter.

32:06.537 --> 32:09.372
Oh, that's good to know.

32:12.110 --> 32:14.345
Will you ever learn
not to play with these things?

32:18.951 --> 32:20.786
Let's go.

32:38.270 --> 32:40.172
Hey...

32:40.239 --> 32:42.874
You're too young to have seen
the Frazier Ali fight, right?

32:42.942 --> 32:45.510
What?

32:45.578 --> 32:48.214
They never saw
his right uppercut coming.

32:51.785 --> 32:53.219
You know I think we're beyond

32:53.287 --> 32:55.455
needing to make your death
look like an accident.

32:55.523 --> 32:57.357
No!

33:08.103 --> 33:09.203
Claudia, what is that?

33:09.271 --> 33:12.072
No.

33:12.140 --> 33:15.642
This is
Johann Maelzel's metronome.

33:15.710 --> 33:18.478
Sykes uses it
to keep Marcus alive.

33:27.188 --> 33:29.022
That was for Steve.

33:40.901 --> 33:43.136
Thank God,
Myka left it open.

33:50.945 --> 33:52.779
Get away from her!

34:01.422 --> 34:03.223
Walk into this!

34:03.291 --> 34:05.759
Walter!

34:05.827 --> 34:07.861
Walter, take my hand.

34:18.774 --> 34:20.408
Mom.

34:20.476 --> 34:21.810
Are you--
are you okay?

34:21.877 --> 34:23.078
Yes.
You?

34:23.145 --> 34:24.279
Yeah.

34:24.346 --> 34:28.016
Walter Sykes
has left the building.

34:28.083 --> 34:29.851
The portal's kaput.

34:29.918 --> 34:32.754
And you're gonna need
to fly back.

34:32.822 --> 34:33.789
All right, so,

34:33.856 --> 34:35.090
get home safe, okay?

34:35.158 --> 34:37.559
And, um, Mom.

34:37.627 --> 34:39.161
I love you.

34:39.228 --> 34:41.264
I love you, too,
honey.

34:44.301 --> 34:45.301
Pete!

34:45.368 --> 34:46.568
What happened?
Where are they?

34:46.636 --> 34:48.203
What took you guys so long?

34:48.271 --> 34:50.304
Just lazy, I guess. Sykes?

34:50.373 --> 34:51.940
- Dead.
- Is Jane all right?

34:52.007 --> 34:53.373
Well, she's got
a 15-hour plane ride

34:53.442 --> 34:55.576
ahead of her,
but, yeah, she's okay.

35:11.594 --> 35:13.262
Thank you.

35:13.330 --> 35:16.399
Anytime.

35:23.240 --> 35:24.207
Claude, hey.

35:24.275 --> 35:25.442
Are you okay?

35:25.509 --> 35:26.676
Yes, and so are Leena
and Mrs. Frederic.

35:26.744 --> 35:28.144
Marcus is dead.

35:28.212 --> 35:29.712
It's over.

35:29.780 --> 35:31.381
Why is that light still--

35:31.449 --> 35:32.349
What--what is it?

35:32.416 --> 35:35.151
They're all--

35:35.219 --> 35:36.219
Artie?

35:36.286 --> 35:38.021
Artie, what's wrong?

35:40.157 --> 35:41.424
Wait.

35:41.492 --> 35:42.859
Mrs. Frederic.

35:42.927 --> 35:44.661
How long should the barrier
normally stay active?

35:44.729 --> 35:46.263
Once the danger
to the Warehouse passes,

35:46.330 --> 35:48.365
it dissipates instantly.

35:48.433 --> 35:49.967
Well, then,
why is it still up?

35:50.035 --> 35:53.104
The Warehouse isn't
in danger anymore.

35:53.172 --> 35:54.505
Is it?

35:54.573 --> 35:56.474
Was he just gonna collect
the Collodi artifact

35:56.542 --> 35:57.976
and walk out of here?

35:58.043 --> 35:59.611
He said he was
gonna kill us all,

35:59.679 --> 36:01.613
but he never tried to.

36:01.681 --> 36:05.150
A man who can walk
does not need--

36:05.218 --> 36:06.585
He planned
on leaving it behind.

36:09.322 --> 36:11.122
Yeah, but why?

36:17.230 --> 36:18.364
Uh-oh.

36:18.432 --> 36:19.999
I know that writing.

36:20.066 --> 36:22.134
That's from
the House of Commons in London.

36:22.202 --> 36:23.536
Oh, no.

36:23.604 --> 36:24.771
How bad?

36:24.838 --> 36:26.138
The House of Commons
was partially destroyed

36:26.206 --> 36:27.640
during the Blitzkrieg
of World War II.

36:27.707 --> 36:29.208
And there was
a piece of masonry.

36:29.276 --> 36:31.176
It was said to absorb
the concussive force

36:31.244 --> 36:36.748
of the entire German <i>Luftwaffe.</i>

36:36.816 --> 36:39.818
This is an artifact
nuclear device...

36:39.885 --> 36:41.286
and it's counting down.

36:52.367 --> 36:54.735
The Ovoid quarantine can offer
some protection

36:54.802 --> 36:56.703
to the rest of the Warehouse,
but I-I doubt it.

36:56.771 --> 36:57.671
I don't understand.

36:57.738 --> 36:59.473
I mean, who builds a force field

36:59.540 --> 37:00.774
that locks you in?

37:00.842 --> 37:03.677
Well, the barrier
was initiated first...

37:03.745 --> 37:05.913
as a way...

37:05.980 --> 37:08.081
of dealing with external danger.

37:13.020 --> 37:16.255
The barrier's still active.

37:16.323 --> 37:17.456
All right,

37:17.524 --> 37:18.591
the primary function
of the Warehouse

37:18.659 --> 37:20.426
is to protect
the world's artifacts,

37:20.494 --> 37:23.095
but the barrier, now, its
mandate has shifted--

37:23.162 --> 37:24.963
To containing the blast
and protecting the world

37:25.031 --> 37:26.198
from an artifact fallout and--

37:26.266 --> 37:27.566
If there is a big, ugly
explosion,

37:27.633 --> 37:30.368
and unfortunately,
if there are agents inside,

37:30.436 --> 37:32.204
that's just collateral damage.

37:32.271 --> 37:34.673
There's less than two minutes
left on the detonator.

37:34.740 --> 37:36.642
All right.

37:38.411 --> 37:41.414
Let me at that thing.

37:41.481 --> 37:44.184
I'm not finding anything yet.

37:44.252 --> 37:45.519
Keep looking.

37:45.586 --> 37:46.419
Something's gotta
neutralize that bomb.

37:46.487 --> 37:47.854
Something.

37:47.922 --> 37:49.289
Can't find anything
on the databases, either.

37:49.357 --> 37:51.191
Okay, so why can't we just go
to the Warehouse,

37:51.259 --> 37:52.426
and find a way
to break them out?

37:52.494 --> 37:54.328
Even if we cannot
stop the explosion--

37:54.396 --> 37:55.429
We can't get
through the barrier.

37:55.497 --> 37:56.964
Besides, there isn't time.

37:57.031 --> 37:58.665
Can I maybe hack my way in

37:58.733 --> 38:00.367
and deactivate
the barrier that way?

38:00.435 --> 38:02.536
The power isn't derived
from the main system.

38:02.604 --> 38:04.104
It's derived
from the Remati Shackle.

38:07.542 --> 38:09.910
Claudia.

38:09.978 --> 38:14.348
You're going to have to give me
back that metronome, please.

38:18.020 --> 38:20.187
Now, please.

38:20.255 --> 38:22.990
No.

38:23.058 --> 38:24.592
You know
we can't use artifacts.

38:24.660 --> 38:27.762
What I know is
I'm tired of arbitrary rules.

38:29.965 --> 38:31.800
The metronome is for Steve.

38:31.867 --> 38:33.735
I'm bringing him back.

38:39.175 --> 38:40.442
Nope.

38:40.509 --> 38:41.843
Takes a licking
and keeps on

38:41.911 --> 38:43.077
trying to kill us.

38:43.145 --> 38:44.445
Okay, the portal's closed.

38:44.513 --> 38:45.813
There's--there's
no back door.

38:45.881 --> 38:47.715
No, no back door outside
the barrier, anyway.

38:47.783 --> 38:48.883
Come on, Myka.

38:48.951 --> 38:49.817
We've gotten
out of worse than this.

38:49.885 --> 38:51.319
No, we have--we have.

38:51.386 --> 38:52.921
There's a solution,
and we can find it.

38:52.989 --> 38:54.423
All we have to do
is keep a cool head.

38:54.490 --> 38:57.159
We'll find it in...

38:57.227 --> 38:59.061
56 seconds.

39:07.738 --> 39:11.040
He did say
that we'd go out together.

39:11.108 --> 39:12.709
I always figured we would.

39:12.776 --> 39:15.411
Not me. I was planning on
outliving both of you lunatics.

39:19.617 --> 39:23.220
And here we go.

39:23.288 --> 39:24.588
Hey.

39:24.656 --> 39:26.990
Helena?

39:27.058 --> 39:29.393
What are you doing?

39:30.462 --> 39:32.763
She's trapped us.

39:32.831 --> 39:34.564
Helena, what is this?

39:34.632 --> 39:35.832
Sorry.

39:39.604 --> 39:43.574
It was the only way I could
think to save you.

39:43.642 --> 39:45.242
What have you done?

39:45.310 --> 39:47.177
There was no other way.

39:47.245 --> 39:50.280
An anomaly
in the system allowed me

39:50.347 --> 39:52.415
to re-route a portion
of the outer barrier

39:52.483 --> 39:54.950
to that spot on the floor.

39:55.018 --> 39:58.087
I just hope it lasts.

39:58.154 --> 40:00.122
You've protected us
from the blast.

40:00.190 --> 40:01.690
You should be safe now.

40:01.758 --> 40:04.526
But you're--

40:04.594 --> 40:06.194
you're out there.

40:06.262 --> 40:09.431
It had to be initiated
from outside the barrier.

40:09.498 --> 40:10.866
No, listen.

40:10.933 --> 40:12.100
You gotta let us help you.

40:12.168 --> 40:13.702
It doesn't
have to be this way.

40:19.409 --> 40:21.143
Yes.

40:28.184 --> 40:31.086
I smell apples.

41:40.858 --> 41:44.993
Claudia, the Warehouse--

41:45.061 --> 41:47.596
Mrs. Frederic!

42:20.161 --> 42:21.261
That was his plan.

42:21.329 --> 42:26.532
To destroy the entire Warehouse.

42:26.600 --> 42:30.370
We lost, Artie.

42:30.437 --> 42:34.974
We lost.

42:35.042 --> 42:38.529
Not yet.
