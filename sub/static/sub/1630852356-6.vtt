Oh, yeah, sorry.

Do you require anything

00:17.509 --> 00:19.628
Perhaps your favorite,

No, thanks, Vazquez.

Nuh-uh, he gets real sometimes.

01:12.129 --> 01:13.748
What's up, my precious peeps?

Yeah, I can't help it.

He's so genuine,

01:55.169 --> 01:56.748
Who's making these videos?

01:56.749 --> 01:58.708
Anyone can make a
video about anything.

Hey guys, today
I'm gonna teach you

02:04.009 --> 02:06.008
First, plop some
eggs on the floor,

02:06.009 --> 02:07.588
and then add a little sand.

02:07.589 --> 02:09.628
Finally, you've just
gotta smear it around,

02:09.629 --> 02:11.048
and really push in.

Well, I'd love to
spread proper information,

how to make a video.

Don't you wanna follow me around

02:47.839 --> 02:49.878
and get into wacky
antics like normal?

Uh, sorry, Cricket,
but if we don't go now,

02:52.089 --> 02:54.208
he's gonna burn all
his merchandise that
doesn't get sold.

02:54.209 --> 02:55.958
Exclusivity!

02:55.959 --> 02:57.208
So?

02:57.209 --> 02:58.838
You wouldn't get it, Cricket,

02:58.839 --> 03:00.878
You don't really like
the internet or merch.

03:00.879 --> 03:02.048
They're already out of posters!

03:10.089 --> 03:12.088
getting a little too
into this nonsense?

I think Master Remy's having fun

03:13.549 --> 03:15.128

I don't think anyone's
gonna watch this video.

But I'm speaking clearly
and concisely about grout!

03:55.749 --> 03:58.048
That may be true,
but people nowadays

03:58.049 --> 03:59.508
have short attention spans.

03:59.509 --> 04:01.918
You've gotta keep them

don't let any setbacks

tile floor of your dreams.

to buy everything.

04:31.799 --> 04:34.548

talk some sense into Remy.

04:34.549 --> 04:35.708

Okay, look, I didn't
wanna mess with your fun,

04:47.589 --> 04:50.298

this whole thing is a scam.

04:50.299 --> 04:52.048
Really, Cricket?

04:52.049 --> 04:53.708
Now you just sound like
one of Itchaboi's haters.

04:53.709 --> 04:55.168
No, I'm not a hater.

04:55.169 --> 04:57.508
I just feel very strongly
that this Itchaboi guy

05:03.089 --> 05:05.298
You never cared about flanking
your steaks or whatever

05:05.299 --> 05:06.838
before this weirdo showed up.

05:06.839 --> 05:08.338
You just don't get it, Cricket!

05:08.339 --> 05:10.838
Itchaboi's message is
about spreading positivity

05:10.839 --> 05:13.798
by buying merchandise,
so that other people know

05:13.799 --> 05:15.838
how much positivity
you're spreading.

05:15.839 --> 05:19.008
Remy, buddy, you've gotta
know how stupid that sounds.

05:19.009 --> 05:20.418
I thought you were my friend!

05:20.419 --> 05:22.458
But face it, Cricket,
you a hater.

- [coughs]
- [metal banging]

05:55.879 --> 05:57.048
- [screaming]
- What's this for now?

05:57.049 --> 05:59.088
[float scraping]

05:59.089 --> 05:59.919
[Bill] Grout.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.799
[meowing]

06:03.589 --> 06:04.748
Grout.

06:04.749 --> 06:06.009
Made by Tilly.

06:06.879 --> 06:08.708
So, what'd you think?

06:08.709 --> 06:10.008
Well, I...

06:10.009 --> 06:11.918
[laughing hysterically]

06:11.919 --> 06:14.248
Anyway, the video
is very interesting,

06:14.249 --> 06:16.338
but where's all
the grout information?

06:16.339 --> 06:18.088
Oh, that stuff
just wasn't playing.

06:18.089 --> 06:20.168
I think this is what the
people are gonna want to see.

06:20.169 --> 06:22.128
Well, you're the director.

06:22.129 --> 06:24.708
All right, I'm gonna go finish
grouting the kitchen tile.

06:24.709 --> 06:27.548
[laughing] I don't know
what's wrong with Bill,

06:27.549 --> 06:29.338
this is comedy gold!

06:29.339 --> 06:31.248
What's good, my sweet buds.

06:31.249 --> 06:32.668
You mean the world to me.

06:32.669 --> 06:34.298
[cheering]

06:34.299 --> 06:36.248
Now I know you all
wish I was there,

06:36.249 --> 06:38.918
but I couldn't make it,
'cause I'm tired.

06:38.919 --> 06:40.338
I didn't sleep well last night.

06:40.339 --> 06:42.048
Why?!

06:42.049 --> 06:44.958
Anyway, I'm here to tell you
about something even better,

06:44.959 --> 06:48.378
The Mirabulous Crewse
for my Mirabulous Crew!

06:48.379 --> 06:50.128
Das yous.

06:50.129 --> 06:52.508
My private party bus
is waiting outside

06:52.509 --> 06:54.048
to take you to the dock,

06:54.049 --> 06:55.918
and once we're at sea,
I promise, promise, promise,

06:55.919 --> 06:57.588
you'll get to meet me.

06:57.589 --> 06:59.458
[gasping]
We get to meet Itchaboi?

06:59.459 --> 07:00.878
And the best part is,

07:00.879 --> 07:03.458
tickets are only $1 million!

07:03.459 --> 07:04.838
- [all] Awe!
- Oh, man, What?

07:04.839 --> 07:05.958
I can't afford that.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.798
Awe, Kiki, that's too bad.

07:07.799 --> 07:08.799
For you!

07:08.800 --> 07:09.838
Woo!

07:09.839 --> 07:11.168
Listen, Master Cricket.

07:11.169 --> 07:13.708
You are not allowed
to talk to Master Remy.

07:13.709 --> 07:15.918
Well, that's just fine,
'cause I wanna talk to you.

07:15.919 --> 07:17.878
Isn't it your job
to protect Remy?

07:17.879 --> 07:19.798
Yes, so?

07:19.799 --> 07:22.628
Well, Itchaboi is turning
Remy into a brainwashed zombie

07:22.629 --> 07:24.378
who will buy
anything mirabulous,

07:24.379 --> 07:26.008
and calls his friends haters.

07:26.009 --> 07:27.378
That's ridiculous!

07:27.379 --> 07:29.628
Master Remy is the sweet,
loving, tender boy

07:29.629 --> 07:30.958
we've always known.

07:30.959 --> 07:32.798
Out of my way, losers!

07:32.799 --> 07:34.458
Master Remy,
where are you going?

07:34.459 --> 07:36.958
I'm spending a million dollars
to go live on a boat

07:36.959 --> 07:39.008
with a stranger
from the internet!

07:39.009 --> 07:41.008
Also, you're fired!

07:41.009 --> 07:42.878
Flaunt yo stacks!

07:42.879 --> 07:44.668
Master Remy, wait, no!

07:44.669 --> 07:46.128
[both panting]

07:46.129 --> 07:48.418
Okay, I see what
you were saying now.

07:48.419 --> 07:50.458
If Remy spends all
that time with Itchaboi,

07:50.459 --> 07:51.918
he'll be lost forever.

07:51.919 --> 07:53.338
We've gotta work
together and stop him

07:53.339 --> 07:54.548
from getting on that boat!

07:54.549 --> 07:55.628
Okay.

07:55.629 --> 07:57.008
- [bones crunching]
- Yeow!

07:57.009 --> 07:59.878
Papa, I'm really
sorry about the...

07:59.879 --> 08:02.508
Ah, I see you've tiled
the whole kitchen.

08:02.509 --> 08:04.088
I'm very passionate about grout.

08:04.089 --> 08:05.668
That's why I'm here.

08:05.669 --> 08:07.838
I wasn't a very
good collaborator,

08:07.839 --> 08:11.008
so I reedited the footage
to include both our ideas.

08:11.009 --> 08:12.838
To finish up, you've gotta tilt

08:12.839 --> 08:15.008
at a nice 60 degree angle,
and voila.

08:15.009 --> 08:16.009
There you go!

08:16.010 --> 08:18.088
Great job, everyone.

08:18.089 --> 08:20.668
In my next video, I'll show
you how to install drywall

08:20.669 --> 08:22.458
- without the fuss.
- [cat meows]

08:22.459 --> 08:24.088
Awe, Tilly.

08:24.089 --> 08:26.418
Heh, the original was better.

08:26.419 --> 08:28.128
[Tilly] This has been
a Billy Tilly Production.

08:28.129 --> 08:29.548
What's this for now?

08:29.549 --> 08:32.008
Hah, you kept that!
[laughing hysterically]

08:32.009 --> 08:33.088
Thanks, Tilly.

08:33.089 --> 08:34.508
We make a good team.

08:34.509 --> 08:35.799
[Grandma]
Oh, my stitches.

08:36.629 --> 08:38.298
[water bubbling]

08:38.299 --> 08:40.838
[gasping] Was swimming really
the best way to get here?

08:40.839 --> 08:42.838
I needed to get my
cardio in for the day.

08:42.839 --> 08:43.878
Whoa!

08:43.879 --> 08:45.338
Itchaboi, I'm here!

08:45.339 --> 08:46.748
It's your best friend, Remy!

08:46.749 --> 08:47.878
Hey, there he is.

08:47.879 --> 08:49.298
Itchaboi, you here?

08:49.299 --> 08:50.958
Yes I am, little dude.

08:50.959 --> 08:53.048
In the fleshy-flesh.

08:53.049 --> 08:54.878
Wow-wee, you're really here!

08:54.879 --> 08:56.508
Whoa, no hugs yet, buddy.

08:56.509 --> 08:58.298
Before I give you any
sort of validation

08:58.299 --> 09:01.048
for your behavior, $1 million.

09:01.049 --> 09:03.298
Oh, yeah, anything
for you, best friend!

09:03.299 --> 09:04.748
[gasps]

09:04.749 --> 09:06.508
No!

09:06.509 --> 09:07.958
[grunts]

09:07.959 --> 09:09.628
Hey, give me back my card!

09:09.629 --> 09:11.418
Squad up, squad up!

09:11.419 --> 09:12.918
[boys] What up, boy?

09:12.919 --> 09:14.508
[gasps] Vasquez!

09:14.509 --> 09:16.088
[boys grunting]

09:16.089 --> 09:18.008
Go, Cricket!
Get Master Remy off the boat!

09:18.009 --> 09:19.628
Come and get it, Remy!

09:19.629 --> 09:21.008
Wait!

09:21.009 --> 09:23.008
Cash slap, cash slap,
cash slap, cash slap!

09:23.009 --> 09:25.008
Give me back my muns, you hater!

09:25.009 --> 09:26.248
[grunting]

09:26.249 --> 09:28.298
Come on, Remy.
He's not your friend!

09:28.299 --> 09:29.918
You're just an
open wallet to him.

09:29.919 --> 09:32.088
You shouldn't
listen to Itchaboi.

09:32.089 --> 09:34.008
And what?
Listen to you instead?

09:34.009 --> 09:35.298
Huh?

09:35.299 --> 09:36.508
Cash slap, cash slap, cash slap!

09:36.509 --> 09:37.548
[Vazquez grunts]

09:37.549 --> 09:39.509
[boys yell]

09:40.089 --> 09:41.459
Whoa!

09:42.629 --> 09:43.629
[grunts]

09:43.630 --> 09:45.048
[groans]

09:45.049 --> 09:46.878
Master Cricket,
what's the hold up?

09:46.879 --> 09:48.048
[grunting]

09:48.049 --> 09:50.048
Come on, little man,
be mirabulous!

09:50.049 --> 09:52.338
Now, negate him!
Negate that hater!

09:52.339 --> 09:54.508
- [groans]
- Here, take it.

09:54.509 --> 09:56.958
You shouldn't listen
to Itchaboi or me.

09:56.959 --> 09:58.708
You should do what
makes you happy,

09:58.709 --> 10:00.168
because I'll be your
friend either way.

10:00.169 --> 10:01.668
Ha, he's giving up!

10:01.669 --> 10:03.668
Now let's party together,
little man.

10:03.669 --> 10:06.298
Just you, me,
and that $1 million.

10:06.299 --> 10:08.298
That's right, I'm gonna go

10:08.299 --> 10:10.298
with the most mirabulous
person I know.

10:10.299 --> 10:11.708
Ha-ha, yes!

10:11.709 --> 10:12.709
Cricket!

10:12.710 --> 10:14.128
What? No!

10:14.129 --> 10:15.628
Ha-ha, good to
have you back, buddy!

10:15.629 --> 10:17.378
Sorry, Itchaboi.
It's been real,

10:17.379 --> 10:19.169
but I know who
my true friends are.

10:20.009 --> 10:20.919
Ha, got'em!

10:20.920 --> 10:22.879
I was a hologram the whole time!

10:24.049 --> 10:25.588
Wow, what was I thinking?

10:25.589 --> 10:28.298
What do you say we get
out of here, best friends?

10:28.299 --> 10:29.958
[cheering]
