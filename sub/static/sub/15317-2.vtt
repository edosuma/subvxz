WEBVTT

00:02.133 --> 00:04.434
Pitting humans against abnormals,

00:04.434 --> 00:06.434
deciding who lives and who dies...

00:06.434 --> 00:08.267
the Cabal has to be stopped.

00:08.267 --> 00:10.534
It's why I started this mission
more than a century ago.

00:10.534 --> 00:11.834
Your mother and her colleagues

00:11.834 --> 00:13.667
will no doubt try to stop us.

00:13.667 --> 00:14.868
I promise you they'll fail.

00:14.868 --> 00:16.934
You're going to help us complete our plan.

00:16.934 --> 00:18.234
What did you do to me?

00:18.234 --> 00:19.534
See?

00:19.534 --> 00:21.534
I told you you'd be better than before.

00:22.734 --> 00:24.234
We know you're Cabal.

00:24.234 --> 00:26.300
You know who we are.
Stop acting like a fool.

00:26.300 --> 00:27.133
Name!

00:27.133 --> 00:28.801
Kate Freelander.

00:28.801 --> 00:30.400
For the record, I'm not Cabal.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.567
So you're what, a freelance operative?

00:32.567 --> 00:34.868
Whoever pays me the
most gets my services.

00:36.300 --> 00:38.601
Ashley...

00:38.601 --> 00:40.567
What have they done to you?

00:42.200 --> 00:43.567
Ashley, please.

00:47.534 --> 00:48.567
Will, no!

00:49.567 --> 00:51.000
She was waiting for us,

00:51.000 --> 00:52.634
but it wasn't any Ashley you'd know.

00:52.634 --> 00:54.467
They've used the source blood to change her.

00:54.467 --> 00:55.934
It's not going to stop there.

00:55.934 --> 00:58.267
There'll be more just like her very soon.

00:58.267 --> 01:01.601
Six operatives are now
ready for deployment.

01:01.601 --> 01:03.634
Their first mission will be the most vital

01:03.634 --> 01:06.534
to our long-term interests...

01:10.200 --> 01:12.634
the complete destruction
of the Sanctuary network.

01:18.234 --> 01:19.767
Magnus!

01:19.767 --> 01:23.734
Magnus, wait!

01:23.734 --> 01:26.000
What are you going to do to her?

01:34.734 --> 01:36.501
You know, this isn't bad,

01:36.501 --> 01:37.601
though I find the peas
are a little overcooked.

01:39.467 --> 01:41.701
The Cabal location you gave us was a trap.

01:41.701 --> 01:43.300
We barely escaped with our lives.

01:43.300 --> 01:44.901
Well, I could see how that would suck.

01:44.901 --> 01:45.767
You set us up.

01:45.767 --> 01:48.634
Okay, time-out for a second.

01:48.634 --> 01:49.934
I did not set you up.

01:49.934 --> 01:51.567
You asked for a location.

01:51.567 --> 01:53.133
That's the only one I know.

01:53.133 --> 01:54.801
Don't blame me if the Cabal
is one step ahead of you.

01:54.801 --> 01:56.400
It's what they do.

01:56.400 --> 01:57.767
Are you completely incapable
of understanding

01:57.767 --> 01:59.467
what's happening here?

01:59.467 --> 02:02.534
They've turned my daughter into a...

02:08.601 --> 02:11.300
I want to talk to your contact at the Cabal.

02:11.300 --> 02:13.334
Now.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:25.667 --> 02:26.634
Dana whitcomb.

02:26.634 --> 02:28.100
is that your real name,

02:28.100 --> 02:30.467
or just the one we'll
put on your headstone?

02:30.467 --> 02:31.501
Helen.

02:31.501 --> 02:32.934
Nice of you to call.

02:32.934 --> 02:34.667
You have my daughter. I want her back.

02:34.667 --> 02:35.968
Before this escalates any further,

02:35.968 --> 02:37.534
I'm willing to listen to your terms.

02:37.534 --> 02:39.434
Well, actually, they're very simple.

02:39.434 --> 02:40.934
We would happily arrange

02:40.934 --> 02:42.300
for Ashley to be returned to you,

02:42.300 --> 02:43.834
provided you're willing
to give us what we want.

02:43.834 --> 02:45.234
Which is?

02:45.234 --> 02:47.000
Surrender the entire
Sanctuary global network

02:47.000 --> 02:48.400
into our hands immediately.

02:48.400 --> 02:51.734
Your daughter, or your work.

02:51.734 --> 02:54.567
You choose.

03:34.551 --> 03:35.683
Tell me you're not
actually considering this.

03:35.683 --> 03:36.717
It's an impossible choice.

03:36.717 --> 03:37.817
Is it?

03:37.817 --> 03:39.151
If I did capitulate,

03:39.151 --> 03:40.451
do you honestly believe that the Cabal

03:40.451 --> 03:41.184
would honor their end of the deal?

03:41.184 --> 03:43.683
She's our daughter!

03:43.683 --> 03:45.117
Actually, I'm not so sure
about that anymore.

03:45.117 --> 03:46.217
Well, what the hell is she, then?

03:46.217 --> 03:47.451
She's exhibited multiple powers... 

03:47.451 --> 03:49.518
teleportation, speed, strength.

03:49.518 --> 03:51.217
Healing powers, super reflexes,

03:51.217 --> 03:52.584
vampiric tendencies. Sound familiar?

03:52.584 --> 03:55.050
Multiple powers?

03:55.050 --> 03:57.451
In one very violent package.

03:57.451 --> 03:58.518
Whatever the Cabal has done to Ashley,

03:58.518 --> 03:59.683
it's obvious that the source blood

03:59.683 --> 04:01.084
is a key element.

04:01.084 --> 04:02.717
We need to find a way to interfere with it.

04:02.717 --> 04:03.750
You mean a weapon?

04:03.750 --> 04:04.351
Yes.

04:04.351 --> 04:06.417
Helen... 

04:06.417 --> 04:08.050
To disable her,

04:08.050 --> 04:09.584
neutralize her powers.

04:09.584 --> 04:11.384
Doc, I'm totally onboard with all of this,

04:11.384 --> 04:12.783
but we have no idea

04:12.783 --> 04:14.050
how much they've messed
with her genetic make-up.

04:14.050 --> 04:15.384
Making a weapon to stop her

04:15.384 --> 04:17.050
kind of feels like a shot in the dark.

04:17.050 --> 04:18.416
Not to mention

04:18.416 --> 04:19.750
neutralizing the effects of the source blood,

04:19.750 --> 04:21.618
or any mind-control drugs,

04:21.618 --> 04:23.050
it could kill her outright.

04:23.050 --> 04:24.618
Then make certain it doesn't.

04:25.618 --> 04:26.618
I'll need two weeks.

04:26.618 --> 04:28.017
We don't have that.

04:28.017 --> 04:29.384
You'll have every resource available, Nikola.

04:29.384 --> 04:31.317
I want a working prototype
ready immediately.

04:31.317 --> 04:33.151
Henry, you'll assist.

04:33.151 --> 04:34.151
Okay, so we know

04:34.151 --> 04:35.417
the Cabal's real agenda now.

04:35.417 --> 04:36.417
They want the entire Sanctuary network

04:36.417 --> 04:37.417
under their control... 

04:37.417 --> 04:38.451
or destroyed.

04:38.451 --> 04:40.084
Either way,

04:40.084 --> 04:42.683
Ashley has intimate knowledge
of our security protocols,

04:42.683 --> 04:43.717
communications systems,

04:43.717 --> 04:45.584
defense designs.

04:45.584 --> 04:47.351
We changed all the codes
when Ashley went rogue,

04:47.351 --> 04:48.683
but if she's as powerful as you say she is,

04:48.683 --> 04:50.117
we're going to have to alter
every security protocol

04:50.117 --> 04:51.217
in the network.

04:51.217 --> 04:52.618
I'll speak to the heads

04:52.618 --> 04:53.584
of every facility,

04:53.584 --> 04:54.618
let them know what to expect.

04:54.618 --> 04:56.618
With Ashley,

04:56.618 --> 04:58.750
they could bring this
entire network to its knees.

04:58.750 --> 05:02.184
Which means that every second is critical!

05:02.184 --> 05:04.084
Work fast, gentlemen.

05:07.084 --> 05:08.117
Spare me!

05:08.117 --> 05:09.451
You're intent on going to war,

05:09.451 --> 05:10.683
while I'm pushing for compromise.

05:10.683 --> 05:11.750
So we surrender

05:11.750 --> 05:13.117
every abnormal under our protection?

05:13.117 --> 05:14.184
I don't think so.

05:14.184 --> 05:15.518
Only enough to get Ashley back.

05:15.518 --> 05:18.217
Fight another day when we're stronger.

05:18.217 --> 05:19.850
We both know that day will never come.

05:19.850 --> 05:20.817
You saw what they've done to her!

05:20.817 --> 05:22.317
How dare you!

05:22.317 --> 05:25.184
You think your sentiments
come from some generous place?

05:25.184 --> 05:26.217
They do not!

05:26.217 --> 05:28.284
It's pure ego!

05:28.284 --> 05:29.884
Ego?

05:29.884 --> 05:31.750
Try regret.

05:31.750 --> 05:33.817
Ashley and I did fine on our own, John.

05:33.817 --> 05:35.117
Don't waste your time on the past.

05:35.117 --> 05:37.084
You misunderstand me.

05:37.084 --> 05:38.151
Again.

05:39.551 --> 05:40.650
My regret is not because

05:40.650 --> 05:42.117
I wasn't here to change nappies

05:42.117 --> 05:45.417
or watch her take her first steps.

05:49.351 --> 05:51.484
What I gave her... 

05:51.484 --> 05:53.884
what the Cabal has summoned from within her... 

05:53.884 --> 05:57.650
are the gifts she inherited from me.

05:57.650 --> 05:59.417
My bloodlust.

05:59.417 --> 06:02.251
You weren't always that way, John.

06:02.251 --> 06:03.618
You were changed,

06:03.618 --> 06:04.817
and like your condition,

06:04.817 --> 06:06.484
I'm convinced
hers can be managed.

06:06.484 --> 06:07.817
And if you're wrong?

06:11.584 --> 06:14.551
What's bred in the bone
can't be undone in the flesh.

06:27.717 --> 06:28.917
You'd think

06:28.917 --> 06:30.584
with all the resources available to her,

06:30.584 --> 06:32.584
she'd have a more updated facility.

06:32.584 --> 06:33.783
This place is as backwards

06:33.783 --> 06:35.518
as Oxford before the war.

06:35.518 --> 06:36.783
The first war.

06:36.783 --> 06:38.151
Yeah, well, I think

06:38.151 --> 06:39.750
Dr. Magnus likes to keep
the old stuff around

06:39.750 --> 06:41.650
for old time's sake.

06:41.650 --> 06:43.584
She trusts it more than the high-tech stuff

06:43.584 --> 06:44.850
I try to push on her.

06:44.850 --> 06:46.484
And she's incredibly cheap, to boot.

06:46.484 --> 06:48.618
I really can't comment on that.

06:48.618 --> 06:50.251
What, paycheck that low?

06:50.251 --> 06:53.151
You don't think we can make
a working prototype in time.

06:53.151 --> 06:54.884
Not even close.

06:54.884 --> 06:57.484
A weapon to disable, not kill,

06:57.484 --> 06:59.317
someone who possesses the abilities

06:59.317 --> 07:02.351
of five of the most powerful
abnormals on earth.

07:02.351 --> 07:03.584
Ludicrous.

07:03.584 --> 07:05.884
Pass me that.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.917
So, how do we instantly affect the viability

07:07.917 --> 07:09.351
of Ashley's altered blood?

07:09.351 --> 07:11.850
Uh, localized radiation burst?

07:11.850 --> 07:13.317
Obvious. What kind of radiation?

07:13.317 --> 07:14.950
Beta, x, gamma?

07:14.950 --> 07:16.251
Concentrated, focused exposure.

07:16.251 --> 07:17.518
Possibly,

07:17.518 --> 07:18.850
but how to modulate
the energy spectrum

07:18.850 --> 07:21.217
so that it has the desired benign effect?

07:21.217 --> 07:24.351
While still taking her out.

07:24.351 --> 07:25.683
The reason I'm asking

07:25.683 --> 07:27.384
is because I don't know the answer.

07:27.384 --> 07:29.717
And I'm me.

07:30.717 --> 07:31.917
Wow.

07:33.284 --> 07:36.451
Excuse me.

07:36.451 --> 07:37.783
Back in five.

07:37.783 --> 07:40.884
Well, I'll be here working...

07:40.884 --> 07:42.750
trying to save the world.

07:42.750 --> 07:45.217
Single-handedly.

07:46.351 --> 07:47.484
I don't understand

07:47.484 --> 07:48.783
Why you can't just use
what we gave you.

07:48.783 --> 07:49.884
A bedpan?

07:49.884 --> 07:51.084
Dude, I draw the line

07:51.084 --> 07:52.584
at sitting on a metal salad bowl.

07:52.584 --> 07:53.584
All right, fine, but the cuffs stay on.

07:53.584 --> 07:54.817
Yeah, I can deal.

07:54.817 --> 07:55.717
Just get me to a powder room.

07:55.717 --> 07:56.917
Fine.

07:56.917 --> 07:57.917
Patient?

07:59.683 --> 08:01.351
Friend.

08:01.351 --> 08:02.518
You have got to be kidding me.

08:02.518 --> 08:03.551
Is that a... 

08:03.551 --> 08:04.618
Yes.

08:05.618 --> 08:07.417
- For real?
- Do you mind?

08:07.417 --> 08:09.251
Do you know what one of those is worth

08:09.251 --> 08:10.683
on the black market?

08:10.683 --> 08:12.683
Seriously... 

08:12.683 --> 08:15.650
More than you can make
in 10 years, dummy.

08:24.384 --> 08:26.618
Lazarus virus?

08:26.618 --> 08:28.518
But I heard there was a cure.

08:28.518 --> 08:31.650
Let's just keep rolling.

08:41.484 --> 08:44.984
Okay, good.

08:44.984 --> 08:46.518
We're ready for mission start,
on your mark.

08:47.817 --> 08:49.317
Start the clock.

08:49.317 --> 08:50.484
You have a go.

09:06.850 --> 09:08.551
Mayday! Mayday!

09:30.817 --> 09:32.351
John...

09:32.351 --> 09:34.050
I need you to take Nikola
and I there right away.

09:34.050 --> 09:34.950
We need to get into this fight.

09:34.950 --> 09:36.017
We can't help them.

09:36.017 --> 09:37.484
What are you talking about? Why?

09:37.484 --> 09:40.683
Because the entire facility fell in 20 minutes.

09:40.684 --> 09:41.684
Tokyo is gone.

09:48.317 --> 09:50.217
Dr. Hitomara refused to evacuate

09:50.217 --> 09:52.050
until his staff were already out.

09:52.050 --> 09:54.984
We found his body in the main lab.

09:54.984 --> 09:56.884
Most of the residents got out safely,

09:56.884 --> 09:59.084
but if we'd been housing
anything dangerous at the time... 

09:59.084 --> 10:00.850
We have a much larger problem on our hands.

10:00.850 --> 10:01.950
Do you have any idea

10:01.950 --> 10:03.017
how they beat the EM shield?

10:03.017 --> 10:04.251
That should have prevented them

10:04.251 --> 10:05.650
from transporting within the facility.

10:05.650 --> 10:06.350
Teleporting within it

10:06.350 --> 10:08.150
would disrupt their molecular structure

10:08.150 --> 10:09.084
beyond recognition.

10:09.084 --> 10:12.184
They targeted the em shields
right after the breach.

10:12.184 --> 10:14.084
After that, we had no hope against them.

10:14.084 --> 10:16.417
All our defensive weapons were useless.

10:16.417 --> 10:18.050
Get in by brute force,

10:18.050 --> 10:20.451
turn off our best defense,
take out the head of the house,

10:20.451 --> 10:21.650
all in just minutes.

10:21.650 --> 10:23.284
There's more.

10:23.284 --> 10:26.683
We detected a remotely-
activated data burst

10:26.683 --> 10:28.184
just before the facility was set on fire.

10:28.184 --> 10:29.783
How much information did they steal?

10:29.783 --> 10:31.717
All of it, Dr. Magnus.

10:31.717 --> 10:32.984
The EM shield

10:32.984 --> 10:34.384
is the only thing that can stop them.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.151
If they continue finding ways to counteract it,

10:36.151 --> 10:37.384
we'll have no defense.

10:37.384 --> 10:39.117
Henry Foss is working
with his counterparts

10:39.117 --> 10:40.683
at all of your sanctuaries.

10:40.683 --> 10:43.251
He's assembled the list
of new security upgrades,

10:43.251 --> 10:45.184
which include modified shield codes

10:45.184 --> 10:46.683
and better perimeter safeguards.

10:46.683 --> 10:48.351
With all respect,

10:48.351 --> 10:51.384
Ashley knows every facility,
every security protocol.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.084
I'm aware of that.

10:53.084 --> 10:54.917
Henry's new countermeasures were designed

10:54.917 --> 10:57.017
with Ashley's knowledge in mind.

10:57.017 --> 10:58.050
That said,

10:58.050 --> 10:59.717
I've asked each of you to evacuate

10:59.717 --> 11:02.884
all residents and personnel
until this crisis is over.

11:02.884 --> 11:04.151
You mentioned a weapon

11:04.151 --> 11:05.184
that could potentially stop these beings.

11:05.184 --> 11:06.284
When can that come into play?

11:06.284 --> 11:07.817
Soon, I hope.

11:07.817 --> 11:09.451
In the meantime,

11:09.451 --> 11:11.384
we're working on finding out
which of the sanctuaries

11:11.384 --> 11:14.417
will be the Cabal's next target.

11:14.417 --> 11:17.084
As much as I hate to use this terminology,

11:17.084 --> 11:18.717
we are at war,

11:18.717 --> 11:20.950
and one that we are ill prepared for.

11:20.950 --> 11:22.251
Can't we request assistance

11:22.251 --> 11:23.551
from the intelligence community?

11:23.551 --> 11:26.184
Our job is to handle situations
exactly like this one.

11:26.184 --> 11:27.984
It's why governments allow us to exist.

11:27.984 --> 11:29.850
If we can't deal with this,

11:29.850 --> 11:33.850
there is no other line of defense.

11:37.984 --> 11:39.351
Did you really inject your own blood

11:39.351 --> 11:41.551
into little Damien here?

11:41.551 --> 11:43.850
We have to see the effects
of the radiation blast

11:43.850 --> 11:45.484
on source blood physiology,

11:45.484 --> 11:48.750
and I'm hardly going to
do the test on myself.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.984
I hope it doesn't make him too sick.

11:50.984 --> 11:52.251
Oh, yes, me too.

11:52.251 --> 11:54.017
Stand back.

12:04.950 --> 12:07.151
Dude, it's losing its mind!

12:08.417 --> 12:10.451
Interesting.

12:12.783 --> 12:14.384
Hey, making Ashley crazy-mad

12:14.384 --> 12:15.917
is not in the same category

12:15.917 --> 12:17.317
as disabling her.

12:17.317 --> 12:19.850
We learn more from failure
than from success.

12:19.850 --> 12:21.484
So I've heard.

12:21.484 --> 12:22.950
Right, so basically
we're back at square one.

12:22.950 --> 12:23.950
That's awesome.

12:23.950 --> 12:24.950
Listen,

12:24.950 --> 12:26.384
the Cabal have been planning this move

12:26.384 --> 12:27.384
for decades.

12:27.384 --> 12:29.084
I've had two days, a crappy lab,

12:29.084 --> 12:30.451
and tiny Tim for an assistant,

12:30.451 --> 12:32.217
so please cut me some slack.

12:32.217 --> 12:33.451
If you think working with you is a party,

12:33.451 --> 12:35.050
think again, Vlad!

12:35.050 --> 12:36.884
Good, you finally showed up.

12:36.884 --> 12:38.184
Quit your whining and get to work.

12:56.217 --> 12:57.317
You look happy.

12:57.317 --> 12:59.117
You heard about Tokyo.

12:59.117 --> 13:01.117
Mm. Sounded rough.

13:01.117 --> 13:03.584
Look, you can help stop
this from happening again,

13:03.584 --> 13:04.917
and spare me

13:04.917 --> 13:06.317
the "I don't work for free" speech.

13:06.317 --> 13:07.884
You know the Cabal,

13:07.884 --> 13:10.384
their strategies, their methods.

13:10.384 --> 13:12.050
Look, this is a great opportunity for you

13:12.050 --> 13:13.551
to buy yourself some credibility.

13:15.151 --> 13:17.184
The head of the Sanctuary,
plus other key personnel

13:17.184 --> 13:18.917
were targeted in the Tokyo attack.

13:18.917 --> 13:20.451
And I'm betting they sent
a remote data burst

13:20.451 --> 13:22.117
before they torched the place, too.

13:22.117 --> 13:25.251
Yeah.

13:25.251 --> 13:28.050
You're in for a world of hurt, my friend.

13:29.884 --> 13:31.518
What are they planning?

13:31.518 --> 13:32.717
The Cabal's been dying

13:32.717 --> 13:33.817
to cut off the snake's head of the network

13:33.817 --> 13:35.117
for decades.

13:35.117 --> 13:36.184
But they can't get to Magnus directly.

13:36.184 --> 13:37.551
But now, thanks to Ashley,

13:37.551 --> 13:40.217
they can work both ends against the middle.

13:40.217 --> 13:41.884
So they plan to target
the heads of every house.

13:41.884 --> 13:43.650
And I'm betting Magnus
junior knows all the codes,

13:43.650 --> 13:44.984
schematics, and protocols

13:44.984 --> 13:46.151
to get her and her freaky friends

13:46.151 --> 13:48.117
into every Sanctuary in the world, right?

13:48.117 --> 13:51.084
So they want to isolate us...

13:51.084 --> 13:53.351
cut us off from each other,

13:53.351 --> 13:54.950
knock out the other sanctuaries

13:54.950 --> 13:56.884
before going after the crown jewel.

13:56.884 --> 13:57.984
This Sanctuary

13:57.984 --> 13:59.351
is the most heavily fortified.

13:59.351 --> 14:01.417
Once they weaken the global network,

14:01.417 --> 14:04.417
I'm betting they'll hit London as a dry run

14:04.417 --> 14:05.884
before coming here.

14:07.484 --> 14:09.884
You seem to know a lot about us

14:09.884 --> 14:11.184
for somebody's who's just a hired gun.

14:11.184 --> 14:14.184
You seem to know squat
about the Cabal.

14:14.184 --> 14:15.551
Not good news for your team, boy scout.

14:15.551 --> 14:17.518
Magnus knows a hell of a lot
more than you think.

14:17.518 --> 14:20.151
Well, then, she should use it.

14:22.151 --> 14:23.151
What about Ashley?

14:23.151 --> 14:24.650
You must know something

14:24.650 --> 14:26.117
about what they've done to her

14:26.117 --> 14:27.584
and how they've changed her.

14:27.584 --> 14:29.417
Uh-uh.

14:29.417 --> 14:30.551
Like you said,

14:30.551 --> 14:34.384
I'm just a freelancer.

14:34.384 --> 14:36.017
Really?

14:36.017 --> 14:37.650
Well, you seemed important enough

14:37.650 --> 14:39.184
for them to want to kill you

14:39.184 --> 14:40.417
when they thought
you were compromised.

14:40.417 --> 14:42.417
That doesn't mean I have an inside track

14:42.417 --> 14:43.618
on all things Cabal.

14:43.618 --> 14:45.050
It just means

14:45.050 --> 14:46.217
they like to kill people they don't trust.

14:46.217 --> 14:49.384
Honestly, I'm just here

14:49.384 --> 14:50.618
because I'm pretty sure

14:50.618 --> 14:51.950
they'll take this place last,

14:51.950 --> 14:53.551
and I just want to enjoy

14:53.551 --> 14:56.584
the last remaining
peaceful hours of my life

14:56.584 --> 14:59.351
before I begin my career
as a hunted fugitive.

14:59.351 --> 15:02.251
You should do the same.

15:05.251 --> 15:06.317
Thanks.

15:24.584 --> 15:26.284
Declan...

15:26.284 --> 15:28.151
We've just got word, Moscow's been hit.

15:28.151 --> 15:29.518
How badly?

15:29.518 --> 15:32.284
15 human casualties,
12 abnormal, lots of damage.

15:32.284 --> 15:33.717
Beijing, New Delhi, now Moscow.

15:33.717 --> 15:35.484
None of our new security protocols

15:35.484 --> 15:36.618
are making any difference.

15:36.618 --> 15:38.584
Did you get the shipment I sent?

15:38.584 --> 15:40.584
Both species are in a secured area now.

15:40.584 --> 15:41.650
Good, I want them ready for deployment

15:41.650 --> 15:42.950
as soon as possible.

15:42.950 --> 15:45.084
If the pattern holds,
we'll have at least seven hours

15:45.084 --> 15:46.151
before the next attack.

15:47.650 --> 15:50.050
Welcome to London, gentlemen.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.050
Will, Nikola,

15:52.050 --> 15:53.217
this is Declan MacRae,

15:53.217 --> 15:54.284
acting head of the UK facility.

15:54.284 --> 15:55.351
Dr. Tesla, it's an honor.

15:55.351 --> 15:56.618
Is it?

15:56.618 --> 15:57.984
Surely James Watson told you about me

15:57.984 --> 15:59.050
before he died.

15:59.050 --> 16:01.451
He did indeed,

16:01.451 --> 16:02.650
in the most respectful terms.

16:02.650 --> 16:04.484
Oh, then the honor is mine.

16:04.484 --> 16:06.451
You have big shoes to fill, Mr. MacRae.

16:06.451 --> 16:07.683
We have a lab set up for you

16:07.683 --> 16:08.984
to continue your work,

16:08.984 --> 16:10.050
all according to

16:10.050 --> 16:11.251
the specifications you sent us... 

16:11.251 --> 16:13.117
I'll need wine, the good stuff,

16:13.117 --> 16:15.017
nothing cheap.

16:15.017 --> 16:16.084
Of course.

16:16.084 --> 16:18.017
This way.

16:19.683 --> 16:21.518
Will!

16:21.518 --> 16:23.551
Hey, Clara!

16:26.050 --> 16:27.017
Oh, my God.

16:27.017 --> 16:28.117
God, I've missed you.

16:28.117 --> 16:29.518
You seem well, Clara.

16:29.518 --> 16:31.750
Hey, Dr. Magnus.

16:31.750 --> 16:33.717
Mr. Druitt, nice to see you.

16:33.717 --> 16:36.317
I see time in the empire
has taught you some manners.

16:36.317 --> 16:38.351
Um...

16:38.351 --> 16:40.151
can you guys excuse us for a bit?

16:40.151 --> 16:41.484
I'm going to...

16:41.484 --> 16:44.618
rip Will's clothes off
before the bad guys attack.

16:54.351 --> 16:55.451
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:55.451 --> 16:56.484
H... h... hold on a second.

16:56.484 --> 16:58.217
What are you still doing here?

16:58.217 --> 16:59.184
I thought you were going to evacuate

16:59.184 --> 17:00.317
with the other residents.

17:00.317 --> 17:01.917
Will, I didn't join up

17:01.917 --> 17:03.717
so I could just run away
when the going got tough.

17:03.717 --> 17:05.351
I want to help defend the place,

17:05.351 --> 17:06.650
and I think I owe Magnus that.

17:06.650 --> 17:08.351
But you heard what happened
to the other sanctuaries.

17:08.351 --> 17:09.782
It's going to get really bad here.

17:09.782 --> 17:11.184
Invisible girl?

17:12.184 --> 17:14.251
Really, we need all the help we can get.

17:14.251 --> 17:15.483
Okay, so,

17:15.483 --> 17:17.084
they have all these old movies here,

17:17.084 --> 17:19.351
the ones with the old
British dudes acting in them.

17:19.351 --> 17:20.384
Yeah.

17:20.384 --> 17:24.217
Now, I don't have any bandages, but...

17:26.084 --> 17:28.084
Okay, that's spooky.

17:28.084 --> 17:30.618
I have control now, Dr. Zimmerman.

17:35.184 --> 17:36.551
Um...

17:36.551 --> 17:38.884
We... we... we don't have time for this.

17:38.884 --> 17:40.151
They are going to be

17:40.151 --> 17:41.351
recalibrating the EM shield

17:41.351 --> 17:42.750
for the next two hours,

17:42.750 --> 17:46.151
and I haven't seen you in weeks.

17:46.151 --> 17:47.251
Okay.

17:47.251 --> 17:48.484
Two hours.

17:48.484 --> 17:51.817
We have a tap on their security monitors,

17:51.817 --> 17:53.251
and we're detecting
high-spectrum em frequencies

17:53.251 --> 17:54.750
Covering the entire compound.

17:54.750 --> 17:56.717
They have their shield up.

17:56.717 --> 17:57.984
Very smart.

17:57.984 --> 18:00.351
It essentially takes Druitt out of play.

18:00.351 --> 18:01.584
Make it clear they cannot teleport

18:01.584 --> 18:03.317
until they disable the shield.

18:03.317 --> 18:04.451
Do you have a preferred point

18:04.451 --> 18:05.451
for initial breach?

18:05.451 --> 18:07.317
How about the front door?

18:21.784 --> 18:22.917
Perimeter cameras show four targets

18:22.917 --> 18:24.417
outside the facility.

18:24.417 --> 18:25.917
EM shield is active and holding.

18:25.917 --> 18:27.784
Initiate countermeasures.

18:27.784 --> 18:29.617
The front door.

18:29.617 --> 18:30.617
They're getting bolder.

18:30.617 --> 18:32.484
It's two-inch steel plate.

18:32.484 --> 18:33.684
No way they... 

19:32.017 --> 19:34.084
Initial defenses breached.

19:34.084 --> 19:36.983
They're beginning their sweep now.

19:36.983 --> 19:39.818
Priority targets are Magnus,

19:39.818 --> 19:42.050
Druitt, Tesla,

19:42.050 --> 19:44.050
Clara Griffin, and MacRae.

19:44.050 --> 19:46.184
Oh, and Zimmerman, if he gets in the way.

19:46.184 --> 19:48.117
Proceed to the databanks on foot

19:48.117 --> 19:50.017
until we can disengage the EM shield.

20:00.784 --> 20:01.983
Stand down, Ashley.

20:57.883 --> 20:59.250
Ah!

21:34.284 --> 21:36.084
They aren't talking to each other,

21:36.084 --> 21:37.718
but they're operating in sync.

21:37.718 --> 21:39.250
Telepathic communication.

21:39.250 --> 21:40.751
They'll head to the main databanks

21:40.751 --> 21:42.184
in the central lab,

21:42.184 --> 21:43.150
Send their data burst from there.

21:43.150 --> 21:45.084
Then they'll target me.

21:45.084 --> 21:46.950
I'm not quite ready
to surrender yet, Declan.

21:46.950 --> 21:48.317
We stick to the plan.

21:48.317 --> 21:51.617
Nikola, how long?

21:51.617 --> 21:52.684
Almost there.

21:52.684 --> 21:54.250
Stop bugging me.

21:59.917 --> 22:00.883
Tag, you're it.

22:39.250 --> 22:41.184
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

23:04.250 --> 23:06.050
That's not cool.

23:09.950 --> 23:11.050
How goes the home invasion?

23:11.050 --> 23:12.084
Not as well as we'd hoped.

23:12.084 --> 23:13.284
We're moving to plan B,

23:13.284 --> 23:14.284
which means I need the weapon right now.

23:14.284 --> 23:15.850
Just finished powering it up,

23:15.850 --> 23:17.217
but you should know
it's hardly my best work.

23:17.217 --> 23:18.850
It'll have to do.

23:18.850 --> 23:20.217
It's time you got into the fray.

23:25.284 --> 23:26.850
Ashley's approaching
the computer core now.

23:36.317 --> 23:39.883
Your mother would be so disappointed.

23:43.451 --> 23:46.050
Am I supposed to be impressed?

24:17.251 --> 24:18.350
Are you okay?

24:20.684 --> 24:23.251
You're kidding, right?

24:23.251 --> 24:24.417
Magnus...

24:24.417 --> 24:27.284
Operation Exxon Valdez is a bust.

24:27.284 --> 24:29.251
Can you draw them into the main lab?

24:29.251 --> 24:31.318
Oh, yeah, that shouldn't be a problem,

24:31.318 --> 24:32.851
seeing as they're trying to kill me and all.

24:32.851 --> 24:35.684
Don't take it personally.

24:35.684 --> 24:37.684
Okay, get going.

24:37.684 --> 24:41.251
I'll give you a head start.

24:42.650 --> 24:45.817
You stay out of sight, okay?

24:45.817 --> 24:48.650
Meet me in the main lab.

25:15.584 --> 25:17.417
Okay, I'm impressed!

25:31.450 --> 25:33.617
Two of them on their way!

25:33.617 --> 25:35.617
Okay, it's officially a party now!

25:35.617 --> 25:36.984
Ashley?

25:36.984 --> 25:38.517
She'll be right along,
despite my best efforts.

25:40.450 --> 25:41.284
Come on!

25:52.517 --> 25:53.951
Sorry, Ashley.

26:02.884 --> 26:04.284
Uh, they're down.

26:04.284 --> 26:05.884
Life signs?

26:08.483 --> 26:10.450
They're still alive.

26:10.450 --> 26:11.984
Good work, Nikola.

26:11.984 --> 26:13.218
Believe me,

26:13.218 --> 26:14.483
I'm moderately shocked right now.

26:14.483 --> 26:16.617
Quickly, get them into secure cells.

26:16.617 --> 26:18.383
All right.

26:25.784 --> 26:27.450
Fall back!

26:27.450 --> 26:28.517
Ashley!

26:39.550 --> 26:42.350
Come on, come on!

26:43.884 --> 26:45.884
So much for plans A to E.

26:45.884 --> 26:47.350
We barely slowed them down.

26:50.383 --> 26:51.884
Clara!

26:51.884 --> 26:53.450
Will! Damn it!

26:53.450 --> 26:55.383
Fire suppression protocols
have been deactivated

26:55.383 --> 26:56.684
For the main lab.

26:56.684 --> 26:57.684
They're locked in.

27:00.617 --> 27:02.851
Release the elemental.

27:02.851 --> 27:04.784
The EM shield

27:04.784 --> 27:07.450
should keep them from teleporting.

27:14.617 --> 27:16.650
They're under attack!

27:19.717 --> 27:21.117
Dear God.

27:23.550 --> 27:24.684
Damage levels are increasing.

27:24.684 --> 27:26.383
We're losing epidermal viability.

27:26.383 --> 27:27.550
How about the em shield?

27:27.550 --> 27:29.117
Still up.

27:29.117 --> 27:30.383
Our jamming device still
hasn't cracked the code.

27:32.117 --> 27:33.450
Abort.

27:33.450 --> 27:36.817
Get them out of there.

27:49.784 --> 27:52.084
There were only three of them in here.

27:52.084 --> 27:54.917
The fourth one must have broken them out.

27:54.917 --> 27:56.617
We held the line.

27:56.617 --> 27:59.051
That was the objective.

27:59.051 --> 28:00.884
Though Churchill may have been wrong.

28:00.884 --> 28:03.017
Victory at any cost?

28:04.684 --> 28:05.817
Magnus!

28:18.584 --> 28:20.951
Will, I'm so sorry.

28:20.951 --> 28:22.483
She wasn't supposed to be here.

28:26.684 --> 28:29.151
She wasn't supposed
to have any part of this.

28:33.517 --> 28:34.717
What now?

28:40.118 --> 28:42.218
We defend our home.

29:16.551 --> 29:17.717
Goodbye, Miss Freelander.

29:17.717 --> 29:18.817
You're free to go.

29:23.551 --> 29:25.684
I heard about London.

29:25.684 --> 29:27.884
I recommend you get yourself
to one of the safe houses.

29:27.884 --> 29:29.050
Things are going to get

29:29.050 --> 29:30.617
very un-Sanctuary-like around here.

29:30.617 --> 29:32.817
Look, I can see why you don't trust me,

29:32.817 --> 29:35.117
but let's face it, you could use me in this fight.

29:35.117 --> 29:36.384
I know your type.

29:36.384 --> 29:37.617
Greedy,

29:37.617 --> 29:38.651
self-interested.

29:38.651 --> 29:39.717
I doubt you even
know the meaning

29:39.717 --> 29:40.751
of the word "loyalty."

29:40.751 --> 29:41.884
We both know when things get rough

29:41.884 --> 29:43.250
you'll simply disappear... 

29:43.250 --> 29:45.083
If I was going to disappear,
that was days ago.

29:45.083 --> 29:47.751
Or you're biding your time
to see who wins this war,

29:47.751 --> 29:50.918
and you'll offer your services to the winner.

29:50.918 --> 29:52.083
Either way,

29:52.083 --> 29:54.918
I want you gone.

30:04.784 --> 30:07.117
Hey, doc.

30:07.117 --> 30:10.651
Em shield's at max power
on a rotating frequency.

30:10.651 --> 30:12.350
The perimeter defenses are, uh,

30:12.350 --> 30:13.784
set toonrange,

30:13.784 --> 30:14.717
and I brought a change of underwear

30:14.717 --> 30:16.851
for the night shift.

30:16.851 --> 30:18.384
Have all the residents been evacuated?

30:18.384 --> 30:19.551
Yeah, everyone's been moved

30:19.551 --> 30:20.717
to secure off-site locations.

30:20.717 --> 30:21.951
Even the shoe's empty now,

30:21.951 --> 30:23.584
which feels crazy.

30:23.584 --> 30:24.951
I know.

30:24.951 --> 30:26.150
Uh, better news,

30:26.150 --> 30:27.317
it looks like we've broken the pattern.

30:27.317 --> 30:28.651
23 hours,

30:28.651 --> 30:31.484
still no sign of the super Ashley gang.

30:31.484 --> 30:32.951
God, I'm sorry.

30:32.951 --> 30:35.417
It's a coping mechanism.

30:35.417 --> 30:37.884
It's fine.

30:37.884 --> 30:39.083
You know, a lot of the residents

30:39.083 --> 30:42.083
wanted to stay and fight.

30:42.083 --> 30:43.751
I told you,

30:43.751 --> 30:46.717
I won't see any more abnormals
hurt or killed by this war.

30:46.717 --> 30:48.018
I know, I'm just saying,

30:48.018 --> 30:51.350
this is their home too.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.918
I understand this has been rough on all of us,

30:53.918 --> 30:55.551
and I haven't been available much,

30:55.551 --> 31:00.784
to you or anyone.

31:00.784 --> 31:02.784
Has he spoken to you?

31:02.784 --> 31:04.417
No.

31:04.417 --> 31:05.617
He won't let us move him,

31:05.617 --> 31:08.551
and he still won't take the treatment.

31:08.551 --> 31:11.150
He's falling apart in there.

31:11.150 --> 31:14.784
It's like he wants to die, so...

31:14.784 --> 31:15.918
I'll talk to him.

31:15.918 --> 31:17.484
Yeah.

31:19.517 --> 31:20.551
Hey, doc...

31:21.717 --> 31:23.551
You're doing what you have to.

31:23.551 --> 31:25.584
We've got your back.

31:27.551 --> 31:30.584
Thank you, Henry.

31:41.417 --> 31:42.584
You've looked better.

31:49.150 --> 31:52.183
The others may question your choices,

31:52.183 --> 31:54.951
your beliefs.

31:54.951 --> 31:57.450
I don't.

31:57.450 --> 31:58.617
We've known each other too long.

32:02.918 --> 32:06.117
We've always understood the need for space,

32:06.117 --> 32:09.450
freedom to live as we want.

32:09.450 --> 32:13.651
It's the very thing that defines us.

32:13.651 --> 32:16.183
Once we let go of who we are,

32:16.183 --> 32:19.117
what we believe to be true,

32:19.117 --> 32:22.551
who the hell are we, for God's sake?

32:22.551 --> 32:26.817
Chattel for the fates, like everyone else.

32:30.083 --> 32:32.083
I've always held

32:32.083 --> 32:35.217
that despite how complex this world is,

32:35.217 --> 32:37.651
compromise is for the weak,

32:37.651 --> 32:38.817
and the cost of that weakness

32:38.817 --> 32:41.150
is too high a price,

32:41.150 --> 32:43.450
no matter how dire the circumstances.

32:48.651 --> 32:53.083
Truth is,

32:53.083 --> 32:57.751
I've been wrong all along.

33:05.951 --> 33:10.751
I won't be visiting you again.

33:23.951 --> 33:25.417
I know, I know, I know.

33:25.417 --> 33:26.984
The spectrum settings were totally off.

33:26.984 --> 33:29.584
I'll fix it.

33:29.584 --> 33:30.651
Nikola, did I ever tell you

33:30.651 --> 33:32.284
why my father founded
the Sanctuary network

33:32.284 --> 33:33.851
all those decades ago?

33:33.851 --> 33:37.183
Because he was a crappy doctor?

33:37.183 --> 33:40.018
Because there was a need,

33:40.018 --> 33:43.617
a multitude of beings lost, in need of help.

33:43.617 --> 33:45.517
The Sanctuary was founded
more out of necessity

33:45.517 --> 33:47.884
than for science.

33:47.884 --> 33:48.951
We protect

33:48.951 --> 33:50.617
the two dominant species of life

33:50.617 --> 33:51.918
from one another... 

33:51.918 --> 33:53.284
humans and abnormals.

33:53.284 --> 33:55.217
It's a fragile balance

33:55.217 --> 33:56.951
That cannot be compromised.

33:56.951 --> 33:57.951
If we fail,

33:57.951 --> 33:59.884
fear and chaos would reign,

33:59.884 --> 34:03.150
and the Cabal would win.

34:03.150 --> 34:04.851
You knew the weapon wouldn't work.

34:04.851 --> 34:05.717
Helen... 

34:05.717 --> 34:07.784
I asked you to make something

34:07.784 --> 34:08.884
that would only disable Ashley,

34:08.884 --> 34:11.684
not kill her.

34:11.684 --> 34:13.551
I realize now that was an impossible task.

34:13.551 --> 34:16.150
Quite impossible.

34:21.117 --> 34:22.884
This is Ashley's,

34:22.884 --> 34:25.817
before she was changed.

34:28.751 --> 34:30.217
You realize if I do this

34:30.217 --> 34:34.150
the weapon will be
completely effective?

34:34.150 --> 34:35.984
I mean completely.

35:38.884 --> 35:40.817
"Once more into the breach, dear friends."

35:40.817 --> 35:42.317
"Once more,

35:42.317 --> 35:46.350
or close up the wall
with our english dead."

35:46.350 --> 35:47.817
Or we could all just run away.

35:47.817 --> 35:50.417
If only we were that smart.

35:52.050 --> 35:54.951
So that's it?

35:54.951 --> 35:57.018
Nikola promises me it's his finest work.

35:57.018 --> 36:00.083
I'm sure it is.

36:01.284 --> 36:02.851
Maybe somebody else should use it.

36:02.851 --> 36:06.083
It has to be me, and we both know it.

36:06.083 --> 36:08.384
Magnus...

36:10.484 --> 36:14.083
she's not Ashley anymore.

36:14.083 --> 36:15.851
I know that's difficult
for you to accept, but... 

36:15.851 --> 36:18.250
You should leave while you can, Will.

36:18.250 --> 36:20.951
You've done more than your share.

36:25.951 --> 36:29.417
Yeah, I should...

36:31.350 --> 36:35.350
But like you said, I'm just not that smart.

36:35.350 --> 36:37.018
This is Will.

36:39.083 --> 36:40.217
Bloody hell.

36:41.250 --> 36:42.317
What the hell?

36:45.384 --> 36:47.884
Oh, come on, no way.

36:47.884 --> 36:49.417
Magnus, we've been hit
by a remote hack.

36:49.417 --> 36:50.951
I've lost links to all external networks.

36:50.951 --> 36:52.284
Looks like it piggy-backed on a cell signal.

36:52.284 --> 36:54.784
What about the em shield?

36:54.784 --> 36:56.150
Yeah, it's still up.

36:56.150 --> 36:57.517
No, no...

36:57.517 --> 36:59.050
no, no, no, no, no!

37:00.317 --> 37:01.317
We just lost it.

37:09.484 --> 37:11.951
Which means we're hooped.

37:30.550 --> 37:32.584
Ashley and two friends just
appeared in the main lab,

37:32.584 --> 37:36.551
and sensors indicate three more
on the residential level.

37:48.084 --> 37:51.484
Ashley, please, for the love of God.

38:03.250 --> 38:05.883
You think it'll go better this time?

38:05.883 --> 38:07.084
Wits and courage, dear boy.

38:07.084 --> 38:08.150
We'll be fine.

38:08.150 --> 38:09.417
I'm not British.

38:09.417 --> 38:10.150
You know, all that "tally ho" crap

38:10.150 --> 38:11.484
Doesn't work on me.

38:31.617 --> 38:35.050
Henry, what happened?

38:35.050 --> 38:37.684
Someone slid a virus past
our jamming countermeasures,

38:37.684 --> 38:40.384
targeted all of our primary
defensive systems.

38:40.384 --> 38:42.117
Can you get the shield back up?

38:42.117 --> 38:43.451
Yeah, that's exactly
what I'm trying to do,

38:43.451 --> 38:44.551
but I need to get to
the mainframe array

38:44.551 --> 38:47.050
to do an override.

38:47.050 --> 38:49.017
It's kind of a slow bitch
without my remote tablet,

38:49.017 --> 38:50.317
which I left in my room.

38:50.317 --> 38:51.417
Henry, it's Will.

38:51.417 --> 38:52.818
I'm headed your way.

38:52.818 --> 38:53.551
I'll grab your stuff and
meet you at the mainframe.

38:53.551 --> 38:54.584
Awesome.

38:54.584 --> 38:56.250
Listen, watch yourself, okay?

38:56.250 --> 38:58.217
All right.

39:06.351 --> 39:07.651
Sorry I'm late.

39:07.651 --> 39:10.417
Big guy?

39:10.417 --> 39:11.983
Come on, get in here before they kill you.

39:17.718 --> 39:19.384
It's good to see you, man.

39:38.050 --> 39:39.684
Run!

39:49.517 --> 39:52.484
I hate you guys.

39:59.017 --> 40:00.117
Nice.

40:18.317 --> 40:20.050
Oh, damage is bad.

40:20.050 --> 40:21.451
I gotta defrag half
the commands in here.

40:21.451 --> 40:22.684
Yeah, well, you know, take your time.

40:43.084 --> 40:45.084
Ashley...

40:47.117 --> 40:48.317
Listen to me, please.

40:50.484 --> 40:54.718
I don't want to do this.

40:54.718 --> 40:56.317
You don't want to do this.

41:02.418 --> 41:03.850
Ashley!

41:07.817 --> 41:09.950
Do you remember when you were small?

41:11.184 --> 41:13.251
You used to come
into my room

41:13.251 --> 41:14.917
in the middle of the night,

41:14.917 --> 41:18.583
and you'd crawl into my arms,

41:18.583 --> 41:22.051
and you'd say, "mummy, I'm afraid."

41:29.917 --> 41:32.583
Ashley...

41:32.583 --> 41:35.117
I'm afraid.

41:37.151 --> 41:39.117
Hey, blondie!

41:52.117 --> 41:54.284
Henry, get that shield up!

41:55.950 --> 41:57.984
Seriously, dude, any time!

42:09.984 --> 42:10.984
We're good!

42:18.384 --> 42:19.884
Magnus, Druitt!

42:19.884 --> 42:21.451
The em shield's active again.

42:21.451 --> 42:22.518
Anyone teleporting now
will be vaporized.

42:22.518 --> 42:24.451
We've got to move!

42:42.384 --> 42:43.451
Ashley, please...

42:45.117 --> 42:47.251
Mom?

43:09.618 --> 43:14.618
