21:01.245 --> 21:02.765
[Petrucci] Do you think we have no guards?

21:03.285 --> 21:07.045
Lorenzo sent
for the Cavalcantis this morning.

21:08.205 --> 21:11.005
[crowd chanting] Jacopo.

21:12.965 --> 21:15.645
[chanting continues]

21:24.125 --> 21:24.925
[Jacopo] Open up.

21:27.325 --> 21:28.885
-[man] The men in the Priori.
-Locked in.

21:28.965 --> 21:31.045
Good. Go to the bell tower, ring the alarm

21:31.125 --> 21:32.285
-fire on the rebels...
-Give me that.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.325
-Guard the door.
-I am the new Gonfaloniere

21:36.405 --> 21:38.165
with the new Priori,

21:38.245 --> 21:40.805
and I demand
you open these gates.

21:45.285 --> 21:46.245
They locked us in.

21:46.965 --> 21:47.885
[crowd screaming]

21:50.165 --> 21:50.965
Move!

21:51.205 --> 21:53.005
Move. Move!

21:53.285 --> 21:55.045
We need to requisition your cart

21:55.125 --> 21:56.165
as a battering ram.

21:56.285 --> 21:59.685
The despots are dead, and we need
to get into the Government palace.

22:01.845 --> 22:03.165
Is that a ghost then?

22:19.525 --> 22:20.885
[inaudible]

22:39.845 --> 22:41.125
[people murmuring]

22:44.725 --> 22:45.925
These men...

22:46.925 --> 22:48.365
are murderers.

22:50.285 --> 22:51.365
These men...

22:57.645 --> 22:59.125
These men are villains.

23:04.005 --> 23:06.245
Your dictatorship is over, Medici.

23:06.565 --> 23:08.085
The people have spoken.

23:08.405 --> 23:11.125
They will no longer follow
one elite family

23:11.245 --> 23:12.685
and their cronies.

23:13.925 --> 23:15.645
The people will rule.

23:23.685 --> 23:25.805
These men plotted to kill me.

23:28.325 --> 23:31.645
Plotted to kill me and my brother
in the Duomo,

23:32.365 --> 23:33.565
on the Sabbath

23:34.005 --> 23:35.325
in the middle of Mass.

23:35.405 --> 23:38.085
These are not crimes
against my family.

23:38.165 --> 23:39.685
These are crimes against God!

23:46.325 --> 23:47.485
My brother is...

23:50.605 --> 23:51.405
My bro--

23:54.285 --> 23:55.245
My brother...

24:00.205 --> 24:01.645
My brother is dead.

24:02.805 --> 24:04.445
[Francesco] We chose to spare you,

24:04.525 --> 24:07.725
but we will spare you no longer
if you don't surrender.

24:13.205 --> 24:14.965
Raise your weapons.

24:15.805 --> 24:17.685
And break down the doors.
-Break them down.
-[crowd screaming]

24:21.525 --> 24:23.565
You heard him. Let the horses loose.

24:23.805 --> 24:27.565
I am just a stonecutter,
I know nothing of politics,

24:28.445 --> 24:31.005
but when the Medici run things,

24:31.405 --> 24:33.085
my trade is good

24:33.525 --> 24:35.005
and my boy eats.

24:39.085 --> 24:40.605
And my trade, too.

24:41.005 --> 24:43.685
[man] If this is
the people of Florence speaking,

24:44.245 --> 24:47.045
why are these soldiers outsiders?

24:47.285 --> 24:49.045
Long live Lorenzo de' Medici.

24:49.165 --> 24:50.605
[crowd] Long live Lorenzo de' Medici.

24:50.725 --> 24:53.205
Long live Lorenzo de' Medici
who gave us work.

24:53.405 --> 24:54.725
And gave us work.

24:54.845 --> 24:56.045
[man] Long live Lorenzo de' Medici.

24:56.125 --> 24:58.645
-And philosophy.
-Long live Lorenzo de' Medici.

24:58.725 --> 24:59.925
You gave us poetry.

25:00.285 --> 25:03.125
[crowd chanting]
Long live Lorenzo de' Medici.

25:04.085 --> 25:05.325
A papal army

25:06.325 --> 25:08.245
will soon be at the gates.

25:09.325 --> 25:11.485
If you resist the will of God,

25:11.565 --> 25:13.125
there will be slaughter.

25:14.965 --> 25:16.565
You've already lost, Medici.

25:17.285 --> 25:18.845
We control the Priori.

25:20.365 --> 25:21.525
[church bell tolling]

25:21.605 --> 25:22.885
[man] Up there.

25:30.485 --> 25:31.965
[church bell tolling continues]

25:41.325 --> 25:43.605
The city's gates will be closed.

25:45.005 --> 25:46.365
Your army will be repelled.

25:46.445 --> 25:47.405
[crowd cheering]

25:54.685 --> 25:55.525
[man] Kill him.

26:01.405 --> 26:02.285
[man] Kill him.

26:12.765 --> 26:14.365
Go. Go!

26:28.805 --> 26:30.045
[guard] Get inside.

26:30.125 --> 26:31.765
Close the gates.

26:39.965 --> 26:42.445
[Guglielmo] Remember that letter.
I opened it this morning.

26:45.165 --> 26:46.725
It was from Francesco,

26:47.285 --> 26:49.285
inviting us to meet him at his villa

26:49.365 --> 26:51.685
to discuss urgent business.

26:52.845 --> 26:53.725
Us?

26:55.085 --> 26:56.005
Both of us?

26:57.165 --> 26:58.245
I thought it was odd.

26:58.725 --> 27:00.765
It... [stammering]
It would have meant missing Mass and...

27:00.845 --> 27:03.565
If it was so pressing why not mention it
when he saw us at the banquet?

27:03.965 --> 27:05.205
Do you still have it?

27:13.165 --> 27:14.245
I threw it on the fire.

27:15.805 --> 27:17.885
So you can't prove what it said?

27:19.405 --> 27:20.485
Do I have to?

27:21.725 --> 27:22.885
To my own wife...

27:23.365 --> 27:26.205
Why were we standing in the nave?

27:28.005 --> 27:28.805
We were late.

27:29.365 --> 27:31.205
And as we came in, I saw Salviati

27:31.525 --> 27:32.765
slipping out of the back.

27:32.885 --> 27:34.725
<i>And then I saw Francesco</i>

27:35.125 --> 27:38.205
<i>not at our family villa in the hills</i>
<i>as he said he'd be,</i>

27:38.605 --> 27:40.285
not in our family pew
as he should have been.
He sat behind Giuliano.

27:49.685 --> 27:51.525
And he had this look on his face.

27:52.405 --> 27:53.925
But by then it was too late.

27:54.005 --> 27:55.205
No, it wasn't.

27:57.285 --> 27:58.405
Why didn't you shout?

27:58.485 --> 28:00.165
You could have saved his life.

28:00.245 --> 28:01.485
I couldn't believe
what I was thinking that...

28:01.925 --> 28:04.165
-that my brother...
-He warned you.

28:04.245 --> 28:07.405
-Not exactly.
-He warned you, and you did nothing.

28:11.565 --> 28:12.685
[crowd cheering]

28:17.685 --> 28:19.805
-[woman 1] Lorenzo!
-[woman 2] Medici!

28:32.965 --> 28:34.405
[cheering slowly stops]

28:39.005 --> 28:41.485
The Pazzi family have a long,

28:41.765 --> 28:44.285
long history of treachery and murder.

28:44.845 --> 28:47.205
And previous crimes have gone unpunished,

28:47.285 --> 28:48.925
because they could not be proven.

28:51.325 --> 28:52.325
But now...

28:54.245 --> 28:57.205
Now I want the entire Pazzi family

28:57.285 --> 29:00.325
hunted down and wiped out.

29:01.525 --> 29:04.365
I want their financial assets seized

29:04.445 --> 29:06.005
and given to the people.

29:06.965 --> 29:08.605
And I want their coat of arms

29:08.685 --> 29:12.245
removed from every building,
every document, every coin

29:12.325 --> 29:14.765
and every surface in this city.

29:15.325 --> 29:19.765
I want the Pazzi name
expunged from history.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.765
[crowd cheering]

29:24.245 --> 29:25.765
Come on!

29:51.085 --> 29:52.245
[all panting]

29:59.965 --> 30:01.085
[distant clamoring]

30:10.285 --> 30:11.445
Open the door.

30:11.805 --> 30:12.685
Let me in!

30:13.325 --> 30:14.165
Open the door.

30:19.205 --> 30:20.005
[whinnying]

30:22.565 --> 30:23.485
[Jacopo] Halt.

30:24.245 --> 30:25.485
Open the gates.

30:29.245 --> 30:31.565
I said open the gates.

30:38.325 --> 30:39.285
[guard] No.

30:43.645 --> 30:46.205
This is an emergency.
I am in control now, understood?

30:46.565 --> 30:47.445
Of course, Signor.

30:47.565 --> 30:49.045
All right, contact Milan and Venice,

30:49.365 --> 30:52.205
demand military support
according to the terms of our treaty.

30:53.205 --> 30:54.085
[guard] We got company.

30:54.165 --> 30:54.965
Bring them in.

30:58.965 --> 31:00.125
[guard] On your knees.

31:16.365 --> 31:18.325
You may confess before I pass sentence.

31:19.725 --> 31:21.445
So we get no trial?

31:22.205 --> 31:23.285
Did my brother?

31:25.725 --> 31:28.205
Nothing I have done is a crime.

31:32.085 --> 31:33.725
I have nothing to confess.

31:34.045 --> 31:36.405
I confess to being
a professional soldier.

31:36.845 --> 31:39.245
I carried out the duties
I was paid to perform.

31:40.365 --> 31:42.005
And my wife suspected you.

31:43.685 --> 31:45.285
Carlo tried to warn us.

31:46.685 --> 31:48.405
My brother even heard rumors of an army.

31:48.485 --> 31:50.125
They will be here any moment.

31:52.485 --> 31:53.405
Will they?

32:00.125 --> 32:01.405
I should have done more.

32:04.605 --> 32:06.085
I should have done more, but...

32:08.845 --> 32:10.565
How could I have predicted this?

32:11.445 --> 32:14.125
[Salviati] You have no right to judge us.

32:14.925 --> 32:17.965
The Medici have killed countless times.

32:18.165 --> 32:21.245
Your father made an orphan of me
with a stroke of his quill.

32:34.085 --> 32:36.005
We were friends, Francesco.

32:41.485 --> 32:43.925
There were times
that Giuliano was jealous of you.

32:49.325 --> 32:50.365
You are a Medici,

32:53.165 --> 32:54.165
I am a Pazzi.

32:59.325 --> 33:01.285
We could never be truly friends.

33:26.925 --> 33:29.485
Hang these two
so the whole city can see them.

33:33.085 --> 33:35.725
He can die a soldier's death
at the point of a sword.

33:35.805 --> 33:36.765
If you kill me...

33:37.645 --> 33:39.165
Carlo will die in Rome.

33:40.685 --> 33:43.205
Not while I have
the Pope's nephew to bargain with.

33:46.285 --> 33:49.085
Jacopo has been seen
trying to get out of the North gate.

33:49.245 --> 33:50.445
[man] He won't get far.

33:50.525 --> 33:53.405
Lorenzo, please do not do anything
you'll later regret.

34:04.725 --> 34:05.565
Hang them.

34:26.605 --> 34:27.965
Spread out.

34:29.885 --> 34:31.325
Search every building.

34:56.405 --> 34:57.244
[Jacopo grunts]

35:02.685 --> 35:04.605
Always looking for trouble,
aren't you, boy?

35:39.325 --> 35:40.805
You kill me now...

35:41.965 --> 35:43.925
and I'll become a martyr.

35:44.005 --> 35:45.445
A martyr?

35:45.565 --> 35:46.845
You'd be forgotten.

35:47.005 --> 35:47.805
No.

35:49.485 --> 35:50.845
Surrender, Jacopo.

35:51.645 --> 35:52.845
Repent your sins,

35:52.925 --> 35:55.085
and you can die with God's grace.

35:55.245 --> 35:56.405
The arrogance.

35:57.885 --> 36:00.045
It's you who's going to die, boy.

36:00.805 --> 36:01.765
Aah.

36:21.085 --> 36:23.045
-[guard] Lorenzo.
-Here.

36:30.765 --> 36:31.645
Do it.

36:35.365 --> 36:36.525
No. Not here.

36:38.885 --> 36:40.445
Bring him to the Palazzo Vecchio.

38:17.405 --> 38:19.525
But they hate us, grandmother.

38:22.285 --> 38:23.285
Why?

38:27.525 --> 38:29.565
Why do you keep on hating us?

38:32.525 --> 38:34.325
It's you who hate us.

38:36.005 --> 38:39.565
Because you are just
a bunch of junk-top wool peddlers.

38:41.285 --> 38:44.765
You may own the richest bank in the world

38:44.885 --> 38:47.525
and could build a thousand cathedrals,

38:47.605 --> 38:50.525
but you'll never be
a noble family like us.

We were destined to rule,
and you know that.

38:56.165 --> 38:58.525

Their hatred is built upon our hatred.

39:00.805 --> 39:02.605
-That's not true.
-[Contessina] But it is.

39:02.845 --> 39:04.245
[sighs] You must listen.

39:05.045 --> 39:07.365
Hatred begets hatred...

39:08.525 --> 39:10.685
Is that why you tried to kill my father...

39:13.045 --> 39:14.965
...why you murdered my brother?

39:16.045 --> 39:17.405

Was Guglielmo involved?

No.

39:31.885 --> 39:34.005
But I would say that, wouldn't I?

-[man] Stop your screaming!

42:58.085 --> 42:59.405
[Sandro] No, no. Give me that.

43:01.045 --> 43:02.405
Oi, give me that!

43:02.485 --> 43:03.565
-[man] Leave me alone.
-Give me that.

43:03.685 --> 43:05.085
-This is on Pazzi, not me!
-No!

43:05.165 --> 43:06.605
Stop it! Give it to me!

43:06.685 --> 43:08.565
No. No, no.

43:10.645 --> 43:11.645
No.

43:11.725 --> 43:12.565
No.

43:12.645 --> 43:13.445
No.

44:03.725 --> 44:05.005
Clarice.

44:05.085 --> 44:06.005
[Clarice huffing]

44:10.325 --> 44:11.805
Is Giuliano here?

44:14.085 --> 44:15.845
Yeah, we laid him out.

44:16.325 --> 44:17.885
Your mother is sitting with him.

44:19.085 --> 44:21.645
This-- this order of yours...

44:22.245 --> 44:24.245
it doesn't apply to Guglielmo, does it?

44:39.125 --> 44:40.365
No, wait.

44:40.445 --> 44:41.325
-Did you know?
-Wait.

44:41.405 --> 44:42.965
-Did you know?
-No, Lorenzo.

44:43.365 --> 44:45.885
I swear before God
and the lives of my family.

44:45.965 --> 44:47.565
You're family of the Pazzi.

44:47.765 --> 44:48.845
Not anymore.

44:49.085 --> 44:50.525
Why weren't you in the pews?

44:50.605 --> 44:51.925
We-- we were in the nave.

44:52.085 --> 44:54.245
I was late. You know how I am.

44:54.325 --> 44:56.085
Of course he didn't know.
You are just feeling paranoid now.

44:56.165 --> 44:58.525
How can you think such a thing?

44:58.885 --> 44:59.725
Give me that.

44:59.805 --> 45:01.405
-Lorenzo, stop!
-I should have known,

45:01.565 --> 45:02.525
and I should have stopped him.

45:02.605 --> 45:04.005
If you kill him...

45:04.765 --> 45:05.925
you'll have to kill me.

45:06.045 --> 45:07.885
-No, no.
-And the baby.

45:09.165 --> 45:09.965
[breath trembling]
[sighs]

45:21.285 --> 45:22.725

45:55.925 --> 45:57.045
[footsteps approach]

46:00.085 --> 46:01.245
We need to talk to you.

46:11.685 --> 46:13.525
[door closes]

46:16.285 --> 46:19.565
You said that Giuliano and Simonetta
would be together forever in my painting,

46:19.685 --> 46:22.805
and yet I just watched it burned
by a mob on a bonfire.

46:22.885 --> 46:24.285
Corpses are being desecrated,

46:24.405 --> 46:26.285
Jacopo has been cut down,

46:26.445 --> 46:27.725
beheaded, quartered.

46:27.805 --> 46:30.765
Each piece of his body being paraded
separately through the city.

46:30.885 --> 46:32.245
You have to do something.

46:32.365 --> 46:33.325
I will do something.

46:35.685 --> 46:38.325
I'll commission you to paint the traitors
on the walls of the Bargello.

46:38.405 --> 46:40.405
I want their shame recorded
and remembered.

46:44.845 --> 46:47.525
[Sandro] Do you know why
the people supported you today?

46:49.965 --> 46:54.085
It is because all your acts of kindness,

46:54.245 --> 46:55.885
all your virtue,

46:55.965 --> 46:59.245
added up to more than the fear
of the soldiers,

46:59.325 --> 47:01.245
and that's why you are alive now.

47:04.205 --> 47:05.005
Look!

47:07.565 --> 47:10.125
Doesn't this fresco mean anything to you?

47:10.725 --> 47:14.485
Don't you see? It is because
of you and your family

47:14.685 --> 47:19.605
that we have been surrounded
by love and peace and harmony

47:19.685 --> 47:21.005
for so long.

47:23.885 --> 47:26.165
Be a... Be a leader, Lorenzo.

47:27.965 --> 47:30.765
Show, show mercy. Stop the bloodshed.

47:35.685 --> 47:36.845
City gate is shut.

47:37.005 --> 47:39.005
The alarm's sounding from Tuscany.

47:40.085 --> 47:41.885
It seemed wiser to retreat.

47:43.885 --> 47:46.205
Any news from Florence itself?

47:48.725 --> 47:51.285
Lorenzo has had archbishop Salviati

47:51.365 --> 47:54.085
and your bankers,
Francesco and Jacopo Pazzi...

47:54.805 --> 47:55.805
hanged...

47:56.845 --> 47:58.565
from his Government palace.
This should never have happened.

48:07.445 --> 48:10.245
I couldn't... I couldn't stop it.

48:11.045 --> 48:12.605
And Cardinal Riario...

48:13.485 --> 48:14.325
Riario?

48:15.805 --> 48:17.045
...is a hostage.

48:23.605 --> 48:25.605
Bring me a messenger at once.

48:52.685 --> 48:53.645
You may live.
Thank you.

48:57.245 --> 48:58.965
But you'll be banished from Florence.

48:59.525 --> 49:01.205
You'll never see my sister
or your daughter again,

49:01.285 --> 49:02.405
do you understand?

49:02.485 --> 49:04.765
It is a generous and merciful
compromise, Bianca.

49:07.965 --> 49:09.645
If my husband is exiled...

49:10.565 --> 49:11.885
I go with him.

49:11.965 --> 49:15.125
Our mother lost their son yesterday,

49:15.245 --> 49:17.525
and you'd force her to lose
a daughter and a grandchild?

49:17.605 --> 49:19.045
-No, you would.
-If you insist on this,

49:19.125 --> 49:20.485
I'll have you both killed.

49:23.645 --> 49:25.205
We live together.

49:25.605 --> 49:26.805
Or we die together.

49:26.885 --> 49:28.845
No. I'll go.

49:28.965 --> 49:31.285
I accept your compromise. I'll go.

49:32.205 --> 49:33.205
We live together.

49:34.125 --> 49:35.285
Or we die together.

49:40.285 --> 49:41.125
Go then.

49:45.805 --> 49:47.605
I want you both gone after the funeral.

49:49.885 --> 49:50.765
[breath trembles]
[crows cawing]

51:08.285 --> 51:10.245
What else is there to do but carry on?

51:14.605 --> 51:16.245
It isn't Venus and Mars.

51:16.365 --> 51:18.045
A different kind of Venus and Mars,

51:18.485 --> 51:19.725
set in an orange grove,

51:19.805 --> 51:22.605
in amongst flowers and fruit and color.

51:24.765 --> 51:26.045
I am calling it<i> Spring,</i>

51:29.125 --> 51:30.445
'cause after death...

51:30.965 --> 51:31.765
comes life.

51:33.925 --> 51:34.765
Rebirth.
