Hm.

01:44.345 --> 01:46.945
You've got some competition, Dieter.

02:02.265 --> 02:04.225

02:57.450 --> 02:59.530
I'm travelling.

02:59.610 --> 03:02.930
- <i>The car check out?</i>
- Tested pretty well, yeah.

03:03.010 --> 03:06.210
- <i>Where am I going?</i>
- Tungsten Security.

03:06.250 --> 03:08.130
Your SAT NAV should
already be programmed.

03:08.210 --> 03:09.890
There's no drop-off.

03:09.930 --> 03:12.170
- <i>It will be in the package.</i>
- Copy that.

03:12.250 --> 03:15.210
- What's Tungsten Security?
- <i>Armoured transport.</i>

03:15.290 --> 03:17.690
They're one of the best-known
security outfits in the world.

03:17.730 --> 03:19.930
So why are they calling us?

03:19.970 --> 03:23.970
Discretion, Frank.
Why they always call us.

03:24.010 --> 03:26.010
All right. Well, let's get this done.

03:30.850 --> 03:33.250
The package is in a vault.

03:33.290 --> 03:35.890
- And I get it how?
- <i>You're going to sign for it.</i>

03:35.970 --> 03:37.890
<i>Access codes are in the passport.</i>

03:37.970 --> 03:41.890
Pickup's at 17:28.
Tungsten closes at 17:30.

03:41.970 --> 03:44.690
- <i>Don't be early.</i>
- That's a two-minute window, Carla.

03:44.770 --> 03:48.370
You get a reputation for punctuality,
people expect you to be on time.

03:50.330 --> 03:53.250
<i>Getting underway in just about an hour,</i>

03:53.290 --> 03:56.290
<i>the playoff debut of
the Ontario Diamonds.</i>

03:56.370 --> 04:02.530
<i>Ian O'Sullivan, businessman of the year
three years running, has boldly predicted</i>

04:02.570 --> 04:06.450
<i>that the all-star outfit, which
now features his eldest son Marcus</i>

04:06.530 --> 04:09.730
<i>at centre, will become
Canada's pre-eminent</i>

04:09.810 --> 04:12.010
<i>- professional hockey team...</i>
- You'd better believe it.

04:12.090 --> 04:14.250
<i>- ...rivalling the Maple Leafs.
It's really an incredible</i>

04:14.330 --> 04:17.649
<i>story, Jeff, you know, long time...</i>

04:17.730 --> 04:20.769
- Heather, another drink?
<i>- Coming.</i>

04:35.690 --> 04:37.890
Who does she remind you of?

04:37.970 --> 04:41.570
So, are we gonna get some action...?

04:41.650 --> 04:46.010
Yeah?

04:46.050 --> 04:48.450
- It's O'Sullivan.
- <i>I know. What's up?</i>

04:48.530 --> 04:51.010
- Checking in.
- Nothing has changed, man.

04:51.090 --> 04:55.290
<i>Be patient. I will call you</i>
when the courier arrives.

05:00.090 --> 05:02.330
Turn that fucking shit down.

05:02.410 --> 05:04.570
We have to leave in about 20 minutes.

05:04.610 --> 05:06.530
I know.
Be patient, for Christ's sake.

05:08.450 --> 05:10.810
- This tastes like crap.
- It's the Glantarnich.

05:10.850 --> 05:15.410
I know what it is. I
pay $350 a bottle for it.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.210
There's too much ice.

05:17.290 --> 05:20.410
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

05:20.490 --> 05:23.810
- What?
- You've been waiting for tonight

05:23.890 --> 05:26.970
for weeks. And Marcus can't
wait to have you at a game.

05:27.050 --> 05:30.370
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You've missed a lot of games this year.

05:30.450 --> 05:32.850
I mean he'll be happy that you'll be there.

05:32.890 --> 05:36.090
Yeah, you're right.
I'm sorry. The drink's fine.

05:36.130 --> 05:37.930
Lot on my mind.

05:41.850 --> 05:43.930
You know what would make me feel better?

05:46.650 --> 05:49.810
Ian...
I'm ready to go.

05:49.850 --> 05:53.010
Come on, my... my hair.

05:53.050 --> 05:55.170
I will not touch your hair.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.490
Come on, sweetheart.

06:07.570 --> 06:12.890
I like the look of those diamonds.
Do you like them?

06:17.010 --> 06:20.330
Come on, sweetheart, I've
got a hockey game to go to.

06:44.730 --> 06:48.290
Stan Rickel?
Really?

06:53.250 --> 06:55.690
Five, three, seven, one, nine.

07:10.490 --> 07:12.330
Let him in.

07:20.050 --> 07:24.370
<i>And at centre for the Diamonds is
Marc O'Sullivan, the young phenom,</i>

07:24.450 --> 07:26.530
<i>and he is carrying a lot
of weight on his shoulders.</i>

07:26.610 --> 07:29.330
<i>Do you think his father
bought him that jersey?</i>

07:29.410 --> 07:31.450
- <i>All I know is he's playing...</i>
- No, that never happens, eh?

07:31.530 --> 07:34.050
Yeah, he's bought and paid for.

07:46.610 --> 07:48.370
Stan Rickel.

07:48.450 --> 07:51.210
Welcome to Tungsten
Security, Mr. Rickel.

07:59.490 --> 08:01.690
I like her tits.

08:01.770 --> 08:04.530
- But she can't dance.
- What's dancing about, anyway?

08:04.610 --> 08:07.370
- Yeah. Tits.
- Exactly.

08:12.850 --> 08:14.410
Right on. Let's go.

08:38.690 --> 08:41.250
<i>- He's making his teammates...</i>
- You wanna turn that down?

08:41.330 --> 08:42.970
<i>...making the hits, and
that's all I care about.</i>

08:43.049 --> 08:45.170
Harry, you check the
secondary short like I asked?

08:45.250 --> 08:49.770
- It's done, boss.
- It's not in the log.

08:49.850 --> 08:54.010
- I will fill it in after shift.
- Wouldn't want anything to happen to you

08:54.090 --> 08:56.810
that doesn't make the log, Harry.

08:56.890 --> 09:02.330
I saw that, Harry.
Write it up.

09:02.410 --> 09:04.890
And I won't say anything
about the unauthorized

09:05.170 --> 09:07.690
use of company equipment
to watch the hockey game.

09:12.570 --> 09:14.930
Why would they let this
guy in without a full scan?

09:17.810 --> 09:20.650
After hours... 17:31.

09:23.210 --> 09:26.530
So this...
Stan Rickel isn't really here?

09:26.570 --> 09:28.650
Oh, he's here all right.
Sneddon's with him.

09:28.690 --> 09:30.890
It's OK, Double-D.

10:09.930 --> 10:11.690
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

10:13.570 --> 10:15.650
Mr. Mayor, glad you
could make it tonight.

10:15.690 --> 10:16.890
Ian, all the favours I do you,

10:17.170 --> 10:20.410
- I had to let you do one for me.
- Ha.

10:20.490 --> 10:23.850
I heard that fucking Sean Gallagher
kid who used to work for you is writing

10:23.890 --> 10:27.450
an article for the Toronto Star.
You want to watch the fuck out.

10:27.530 --> 10:29.490
We're here to see

10:29.570 --> 10:31.450
a star in the making...
my nephew Marcus,

10:31.530 --> 10:34.290
<i>who we're all rooting for tonight.</i>

10:45.650 --> 10:48.650
- Yeah.
- We're on.

10:48.730 --> 10:52.170
- Call me when it's done.
- What about the courier?

10:52.250 --> 10:55.010
- Kill him.
- <i>Just want to be sure.</i>

10:55.050 --> 10:57.370
It's hard to keep up with
all the people you want dead.

10:59.850 --> 11:01.850
Let's go!

11:08.050 --> 11:10.490
- Open the door.
- Those the getaways?

11:10.530 --> 11:12.730
Yes.

11:21.490 --> 11:26.690
- Thanks for coming, Stan.
- And miss my sister's son's big night?

11:28.610 --> 11:33.530
- That asshole treating you all right?
- Everything's fine.

11:40.930 --> 11:45.130
- What do you want now?
- I thought you might like a drink.

11:45.210 --> 11:46.850
<i>Get me a scotch.</i>

11:49.090 --> 11:51.170
And I don't want you drinking tonight.

11:54.690 --> 11:58.010
<i>I'd like to propose a toast. </i>
To the Diamonds,

11:58.050 --> 12:00.490
but more importantly
to the city of Toronto

12:00.570 --> 12:04.050
and its people. There's no
place I'd rather call home.

12:04.130 --> 12:06.850
<i> Hear, hear! Cheers! </i>

12:10.530 --> 12:12.810
You're to take the package
and leave immediately.

12:12.890 --> 12:15.330
You have 30 seconds
till that door closes.

12:19.570 --> 12:23.290
- There's no destination.
- That's not my business.

12:29.730 --> 12:32.730
No reception.
Anyway, you're out of time.

12:40.610 --> 12:42.570
<i>You know, I was gonna take my nephew.</i>

12:42.650 --> 12:46.570
<i>Yeah, take my nephew to this game.
I had tickets and everything.</i>

12:46.650 --> 12:50.130
Watch these turkeys get their ass
beat? You're better off working.

12:50.210 --> 12:53.490
What do you think, Double-D?
Diamonds got a chance?

12:53.570 --> 12:55.570
I think you should stop
calling me Double-D.

12:55.650 --> 12:59.130
Why? It suits you.
Darcy Daniels.

12:59.170 --> 13:03.690
It suits you better, Lester.
Your tits are bigger than mine.

13:03.770 --> 13:07.050
Can you still make face-off?

13:07.130 --> 13:09.530
- Go on, get.
- Really?

13:09.610 --> 13:13.850
Yeah, yeah, it's quiet.
Me and Lester got it covered.

13:34.610 --> 13:37.210
Have a good one, buddy.
<i>I'm off to the hockey game.</i>

13:37.290 --> 13:39.410
<i>The puck is about to
drop for the first period.</i>

13:39.450 --> 13:42.810
<i>It should be quite a game. And...</i>

13:45.450 --> 13:48.610
- We lost our feed.
- It'll come back. It always does.

13:48.690 --> 13:51.050
Just give it a minute.

13:51.130 --> 13:52.930
<i>Oh, what a hit!</i>

13:53.010 --> 13:58.810
- Hey. Something's wrong.
- Hey! Ah!

14:48.050 --> 14:50.250
Gentlemen, this is a client.

15:02.970 --> 15:05.850
<i>Both teams exchanging blows.</i>

15:09.690 --> 15:12.130
Get to the vault. Lock yourself in.

15:12.210 --> 15:14.370
But there's a time-lock.
It won't open till morning.

15:14.450 --> 15:16.770
Then this'll be over.
Have a nice night.

15:31.210 --> 15:34.730
<i>Oh-ho! Denied!</i>

15:34.810 --> 15:38.050
- I'm gonna go check it out.
- Go, Diamonds!

15:46.050 --> 15:48.930
- Don't move.
- Look, I know this looks bad.

15:49.010 --> 15:51.090
No.
No, the guards aren't guards.

15:51.130 --> 15:53.330
What?

15:53.370 --> 15:59.610
When did Tungsten start hiring guys
with gang tattoos, Darcy Daniels?

15:59.690 --> 16:03.570
- How do you know my name?
- Name tag.

16:03.610 --> 16:05.570
Oh.

16:07.890 --> 16:09.490
Get on the floor!

16:15.770 --> 16:17.490
You got to be kidding me.

16:20.210 --> 16:22.370
I'm not the bad guy, OK?
Think!

16:22.450 --> 16:25.290
- Speaking of which...
- He could be with you.

16:25.330 --> 16:27.570
If he's not, which he's
not, then we're both dead.

16:27.650 --> 16:29.330
And I can't take him on

16:29.410 --> 16:31.210
single-handedly... literally.
Where's the key?

16:31.250 --> 16:36.170
Um...
I... I must have lost it.

16:36.210 --> 16:38.610
That door's not going
to hold them forever.

16:41.490 --> 16:42.930
They cut the alarm!

16:43.010 --> 16:45.770
- And the phone's dead, and...
- You lost it?

16:45.810 --> 16:48.090
I don't know what happened!
It must have shaken loose

16:48.170 --> 16:51.090
- when you attacked me!
- When I attacked you?

16:55.010 --> 16:57.210
Darcy, tell me there's another
way out or we're both dead.

17:15.250 --> 17:17.410
Lester, come in.
Do you read me?

17:17.490 --> 17:19.210
<i>We have a goddamn breach,
the alarms are down,</i>

17:19.490 --> 17:20.650
<i>and Harry's been fucking shot!</i>

17:20.690 --> 17:22.530
- Lester!
- Who's Lester?

17:22.609 --> 17:25.010
- Security office. Lester!

17:25.089 --> 17:29.730
You two. Go to the security room.
You're with me.

17:32.810 --> 17:35.530
<i>Lester. Lester, come in. We're on
the fourth floor, and I need help.</i>

17:35.610 --> 17:38.730
- <i>Again, we're on the fourth floor.</i>
- Darcy, is that you?

17:38.810 --> 17:41.290
Oh, God, thank God. I
need you to call the police.

17:41.330 --> 17:43.290
<i>We're on the fourth floor.
We have a goddamn breach...</i>

17:49.690 --> 17:51.650
They're on the fourth floor.

17:51.690 --> 17:55.690
Copy that.
They're up three floors.

18:01.010 --> 18:02.890
What are we going to do?

18:02.970 --> 18:05.210
Well, first, let's lose these.
Is there a place in the building

18:05.290 --> 18:08.010
- with tools? Like a maintenance office?
- This is an office building,

18:08.090 --> 18:09.930
it's not a construction
site. We've got shrinks,

18:09.970 --> 18:12.290
we've got plastic surgeons,
we've got dentists...

18:12.330 --> 18:14.370
Dentist. Take me there.

18:14.410 --> 18:15.890
Take me to the dentist.

18:21.810 --> 18:26.610
- Oh, uh, uh... could I, uh...
- What?

18:26.690 --> 18:30.410
I drink a lot of water.
It'll be quick.

18:32.370 --> 18:37.330
Oh, no.
Can you just wait here?

18:37.410 --> 18:41.330
<i>- Geez, uh, can you run the water?
- No.</i>

18:41.410 --> 18:44.010
- Can you sing a song?
- Absolutely no.

18:44.090 --> 18:46.730
Oh, no, no, no,
I gotta wash. Quick.

18:56.690 --> 18:58.890
Ah! Ah!

19:12.290 --> 19:14.370
In here. Quick.

19:15.090 --> 19:16.450
Go, go.

19:16.490 --> 19:19.210
<i>Roco. Roco!</i>

19:22.690 --> 19:25.850
Hurry up! Let's go!

19:25.930 --> 19:27.410
Let's go! Let's go!

19:30.170 --> 19:33.450
<i>- Which way?
- They headed towards dentistry.</i>

19:33.490 --> 19:36.250
Jesus Christ! Who are those
guys? And who the hell are you?

19:36.330 --> 19:39.250
Darcy, calm down. Think! Use your
training... assuming you have any.

19:39.330 --> 19:41.810
It wasn't what was in
the vault they were after.

19:41.890 --> 19:44.290
- They were after you. Right?
- Yeah.

19:44.330 --> 19:47.250
- Why?
- Because I have something that they want.

19:47.330 --> 19:50.050
- Why not just give it back?
- It doesn't usually work that way.

19:50.130 --> 19:52.170
- What is it?
- Doesn't work that way, either.

19:52.250 --> 19:53.650
Technically, we're not
supposed to open the package.

19:53.970 --> 19:54.890
What does that even mean?

19:54.970 --> 19:56.970
These guys are trying to
kill us! Just give them

19:57.050 --> 19:58.890
what they want, and let's
get the hell out of here!

20:11.010 --> 20:13.570
Get the C-4.

20:13.610 --> 20:16.490
<i> Driver!</i>

20:18.530 --> 20:21.730
I can wait.
I am a patient man.

20:42.850 --> 20:48.010
- We're kind of trapped in here, right?
- Well, you could, uh... well, yes.

20:48.090 --> 20:51.810
- Was that part of the plan?
- The trapped part? Not so much.

20:51.890 --> 20:53.690
OK.

20:56.570 --> 20:57.890
Shit.

21:02.130 --> 21:07.090
Um... are you looking
for anything in particular?

21:07.170 --> 21:09.570
- Drill bits.
- Drill bits, drill bits...

21:09.610 --> 21:11.650
What do they look like?

21:11.730 --> 21:17.410
- They look like this?
- These are supposed to be diamond.

21:29.090 --> 21:31.570
I don't think that's
the ideal application.

21:34.090 --> 21:36.330
You been in this line of work long?

21:36.410 --> 21:40.730
- What, dentistry?
- The bad-guy-fighting thing.

22:06.370 --> 22:08.570
You're getting good at this.
Go. Get to a phone.

22:08.650 --> 22:11.810
- Get out.
- Ah!

22:11.890 --> 22:13.890
Let her go.

22:16.730 --> 22:18.610
You guys look like you
could both use a check-up.

22:26.730 --> 22:29.530
<i>Oh, he's taking a run at him now.</i>

22:45.210 --> 22:47.130
<i>Oops! There's a cheap shot.</i>

22:51.890 --> 22:53.850
<i>Nice use of the hands right there.</i>

23:17.370 --> 23:20.130
Idiot!

23:27.510 --> 23:29.010
<i>No good.</i>

23:58.770 --> 24:00.690
Score one for Darcy Daniels.

24:06.330 --> 24:11.170
Someone tripped the alarm.
Let's go downstairs.

24:17.650 --> 24:21.330
Rule number three, Frank:
don't open the package.

24:31.930 --> 24:33.970
Diamond.

24:35.890 --> 24:39.090
What the fuck has all this
got to do with a raw diamond?

24:59.570 --> 25:03.770
- Harry. Shit.
- You could say that.

25:06.290 --> 25:08.290
Throw off the cops and
meet us in the garage.

25:17.850 --> 25:20.050
You better have made
it out of here, Darcy.

25:28.490 --> 25:32.010
- What've we got?
- There's a guy

25:32.050 --> 25:33.930
on the fourth floor in a black suit.

25:33.970 --> 25:37.330
He shot the guard and a couple
other people. He's still armed.

26:02.890 --> 26:05.810
He'll come for the girl.
I'll take her to O'Sullivan.

26:06.090 --> 26:09.010
Get the courier before the
cops do. I want the package.

27:14.570 --> 27:18.570
- Mrs. O'Sullivan, I understand that your
husband travels a lot.  - Yes, he does.

27:20.850 --> 27:23.210
I'm sorry, can you
just give me a minute?

27:23.250 --> 27:24.490
Sure.

27:25.730 --> 27:28.410
What the fuck is going on?

27:28.490 --> 27:30.810
- <i>We do not have the package.</i>
- What do you mean?

27:30.890 --> 27:33.130
The courier managed to
create a little mayhem.

27:33.210 --> 27:37.370
- That's what I pay you for, Leon.
- From me you'll get a big mayhem.

27:37.450 --> 27:39.970
Just get the fucking package.

27:42.170 --> 27:43.730
<i> Let me out! </i>

27:50.330 --> 27:55.250
- Sorry. Where were we?
- Uh, Mrs. O'Sullivan was just telling me

27:55.285 --> 27:58.090
about some of your charitable
work in Africa. Sierra Leone.

27:58.130 --> 28:02.730
Yes, Africa. It's one of our
favourite places, isn't it, sweetheart?

28:06.930 --> 28:09.090
<i>Where have you been, Frank?</i>

28:09.130 --> 28:11.730
The client called twice, and
now I can't get him on the line.

28:11.810 --> 28:15.330
I've had my hands full, Carla. I'm
not the only one after the package.

28:15.410 --> 28:17.330
- Who else wants it?
- <i>How would I know?</i>

28:17.410 --> 28:19.370
They're happy enough to kill
people to get it, though.

28:19.450 --> 28:21.290
So drop it off, and get
the hell out of there, Frank.

28:21.570 --> 28:22.530
<i>Well, that's the plan,</i>

28:22.570 --> 28:24.290
Carla, but I still don't
know where I'm going.

28:24.370 --> 28:26.250
The address is on the
front of the package.

28:26.330 --> 28:27.690
No, it's not.

28:27.770 --> 28:32.250
There is a backup.
You have to open the package.

28:32.330 --> 28:37.050
- The rules, Carla, the rules.
- Break the rules once in a while.

28:37.130 --> 28:39.810
I break the rules
at least once a week.

28:39.890 --> 28:44.770
<i>It's a SIM card</i>
like the ones you put in a phone.

28:44.850 --> 28:47.010
<i>Put it in the port on
the back of the dash screen</i>

28:47.050 --> 28:49.010
so I can access the drop-off address.

28:49.090 --> 28:52.050
- <i>Do you have the card?</i>
- I do, Carla.

29:03.410 --> 29:06.450
Oh, this is just getting
better and better.

30:00.250 --> 30:02.970
- So, it's like that, is it?
- <i>Frank? Do you hear me?</i>

30:03.010 --> 30:05.290
Carla, I'm busy.

30:52.130 --> 30:56.570
- Frank, are you OK?
- Toronto traffic is a bitch, Carla.

30:58.610 --> 31:04.410
OK, the card belongs to Sean Gallagher,
Frank. 514 Union St. in Yorkville.

31:04.450 --> 31:07.810
<i>Apartment number 2230.
Sending coordinates.</i>

31:07.890 --> 31:11.770
- <i>I'm on my way.</i>
- There are video files stored on it.

31:11.810 --> 31:15.050
Was there anything else in the package?

31:15.130 --> 31:18.170
There was. A raw diamond.
It was odd.

31:18.210 --> 31:21.290
- The video files are encrypted.
- Well, they must be pretty important

31:21.370 --> 31:23.090
<i>for those guys to
blow up half a building.</i>

32:03.970 --> 32:05.930
Sean Gallagher?

32:50.730 --> 32:52.170
Yes, Frank?

32:52.210 --> 32:54.810
<i>What do we know about an
Ian O'Sullivan of Toronto?</i>

32:54.890 --> 32:57.650
<i>Funny you should ask
that, Frank. I just broke</i>

32:57.730 --> 33:01.650
the encryption on that SIM card.
It looks like a news item on O'Sullivan.

33:01.690 --> 33:05.730
Lots of photos of a guy who is not
very nice to the people he works with.

33:05.810 --> 33:09.410
Uploading photo.

33:09.490 --> 33:12.170
He's a big deal in African mining.

33:12.210 --> 33:16.970
Diamonds. Supplies equipment,
according to the company.

33:17.010 --> 33:19.330
<i>He's not a very nice man, Frank.</i>

33:19.410 --> 33:22.210
- This is what was on the SIM card?
- <i>Yes.</i>

33:22.290 --> 33:25.490
- And Sean Gallagher?
- Used to work for O'Sullivan

33:25.530 --> 33:27.690
as a media advisor,
but now he's a reporter

33:27.730 --> 33:30.730
- <i>for the Toronto Star.</i>
- WAS a reporter?

33:30.770 --> 33:33.530
- <i>What, Frank?</i>
- Nothing, Carla.

33:33.610 --> 33:36.290
<i>He was doing this
story on O'Sullivan.</i>

33:36.370 --> 33:40.530
- <i>Is there anything else?</i>
- There is video as well as photos.

33:40.570 --> 33:44.210
<i>Under the guise of industry
and natural resources exploration,</i>

33:44.250 --> 33:48.570
<i>O'Sullivan waged a decades-long campaign
against diamond-rich African nations...</i>

33:48.650 --> 33:53.050
- It's really ugly stuff, Frank.
<i>- ...amassing a fortune for himself</i>

33:53.130 --> 33:55.170
<i>while leaving behind a trail of blood.</i>

33:55.250 --> 33:59.490
I'm sending you a clean
copy of both to the SIM card.

34:04.570 --> 34:08.969
Come on, get him. Don't
let him get across the line.

34:09.250 --> 34:11.449
Come on, guys! Come on!

34:15.090 --> 34:17.810
<i>Yes, goddamn it!
That's my boy!</i>

34:17.889 --> 34:21.170
That's my son! Number 19!

34:27.650 --> 34:33.330
- Leon. I am disappointed.
- The courier will be here soon enough.

34:33.409 --> 34:35.370
<i>I have the girl from Tungsten.</i>

34:35.409 --> 34:38.690
I want the reporter's story as
dead as the reporter, you got me?

34:38.770 --> 34:42.330
We have something he
wants. He will come for her.

34:46.449 --> 34:48.330
Who the fuck is this?

34:48.370 --> 34:50.650
I was wondering if I could
speak to Ian O'Sullivan.

34:50.730 --> 34:55.330
This is O'Sullivan...
<i>It's the fucking courier.</i>

34:55.370 --> 34:58.650
<i>Here's how it's going to work,
chump. You're going to bring that chip</i>

34:58.730 --> 35:02.650
to my place of business, and just maybe your
girlfriend will walk out of here in one piece.

35:02.730 --> 35:06.130
- Girlfriend? - The girl from Tungsten.
- <i>She's not my girlfriend.</i>

35:06.210 --> 35:08.890
And might I suggest you watch
your tone, or I might get lost

35:08.970 --> 35:11.690
<i>on the way to your hockey game
and end up at the Toronto Star.</i>

35:11.730 --> 35:13.610
They might be very interested

35:13.690 --> 35:15.530
<i>in this diamond that Sean
Gallagher had for them.</i>

35:15.570 --> 35:17.450
Fuck you!

35:23.330 --> 35:24.770
Yeah.

35:24.810 --> 35:29.010
He's on his way. Bring
the girl and stash her.

35:29.090 --> 35:32.850
- What about the driver?
- I'll take care of the fucking driver.

35:47.850 --> 35:50.730
Watch the corridor. Stay here.

36:16.850 --> 36:18.810
- Where's the girl?
- Fuck you!

36:18.890 --> 36:21.330
Oh, yeah?

36:37.770 --> 36:43.170
- How many of these clowns are there?
- At least three, maybe more.

36:43.210 --> 36:46.570
- You OK?
- You came back for me.

36:46.850 --> 36:49.930
- I told you to run.
- And leave you behind?

36:50.210 --> 36:51.970
You know how hard it is
to find a good dentist?

36:52.050 --> 36:54.290
Darcy Daniels.

36:56.530 --> 37:00.450
You might need this.
Come on, let's move it.

37:00.490 --> 37:05.530
Come on, Marcus.
Don't be a pussy.

37:05.610 --> 37:08.210
I taught you to be tough.

37:08.290 --> 37:10.010
<i>Marcus!</i>

37:10.050 --> 37:13.010
<i> Marcus! You should've</i>

37:13.090 --> 37:15.250
flattened that asshole
after he slashed you!

37:17.490 --> 37:20.290
He's gonna salute me. He
said he's gonna salute me.

37:23.330 --> 37:26.650
See that? Behind every
great man is his father.

37:41.250 --> 37:44.850
The courier's here.
He's got her. Go find him, Leon!

37:44.930 --> 37:48.610
Mr. O'Sullivan, please...
be calm.

37:48.650 --> 37:51.450
Calm?
Calm, you fucking idiot?

37:51.490 --> 37:53.730
That courier has got videotape of you

37:53.810 --> 37:56.130
chopping off children's hands,
and you want me

37:56.210 --> 37:58.850
- to be fucking calm?!
- I am not a part of this.

37:58.930 --> 38:02.170
Yes, you are part of it!
Don't you remember

38:02.210 --> 38:04.930
where you were before I
dragged you out of the mud?

38:05.010 --> 38:08.810
Yes, I do. And I will
not be going back there.

38:12.050 --> 38:14.890
Get rid of this piece of shit.

38:17.890 --> 38:19.330
Ugh!

38:19.410 --> 38:24.850
Do not do that again, or
it will be your hand next.

38:26.730 --> 38:29.970
Go on, then.
Go to hell.

38:32.890 --> 38:38.570
- We will see each other again.
- Not if I can help it.

38:40.770 --> 38:41.850
Call the cops. Give
them Leon's description,

38:42.130 --> 38:43.210
tell them where he put Gallagher's body.

38:43.290 --> 38:45.570
I'm going after the goddamn courier!

39:04.930 --> 39:07.050
Can you put this on the big screen?

39:07.130 --> 39:10.970
- I think so.
- OK, go to it. I'll handle O'Sullivan.

39:12.370 --> 39:14.170
Wait.

39:20.170 --> 39:23.130
That's for luck, "Stan".

39:36.410 --> 39:41.210
<i>- This is my ice!</i>
- Come and get it!

39:48.810 --> 39:50.930
<i> Whoa!
We've got the suits and</i>

39:51.210 --> 39:53.370
<i>ties on the ice as well!
Can you believe it?</i>

39:56.250 --> 39:58.370
<i>They're gonna get some
scuff marks on their shoes.</i>

39:58.450 --> 40:00.770
<i>There's a couple of
haymakers exchanged there!</i>

40:00.850 --> 40:05.090
Oh-ho-ho, my!
I kid you not, I do not recall

40:05.370 --> 40:09.650
an evening on the ice
like this in some time.

40:11.810 --> 40:14.690
Mr. O'Sullivan needs
this to be broadcast A-SAP.

40:14.770 --> 40:20.490
- Who the hell are you?
- The new program director. Run it.

40:30.370 --> 40:32.290
Come on, come on.

40:38.850 --> 40:40.970
Yes.

40:43.890 --> 40:46.010
<i>Under the guise of industry</i>

40:46.090 --> 40:48.930
<i>and natural resources
exploration, O'Sullivan waged</i>

40:49.010 --> 40:53.090
<i>a decades-long campaign against
diamond-rich African nations,</i>

40:53.170 --> 40:57.330
<i>amassing a fortune for himself,
while leaving behind a trail of blood.</i>

40:59.690 --> 41:03.570
<i>While some who possess such
immense wealth choose to give back,</i>

41:03.610 --> 41:07.890
<i>O'Sullivan has chosen to only take...
in the economic and literal sense...</i>

41:07.970 --> 41:11.370
<i>brutally ripping limbs and
lives from those in his way.</i>

41:12.410 --> 41:15.730
<i>Not content to be merely
a profit-driven capitalist</i>

41:15.770 --> 41:19.330
<i>guilty of plundering the natural
resources of a foreign country,</i>

41:19.410 --> 41:22.050
<i>O'Sullivan bears a sadistic streak.</i>

41:22.130 --> 41:24.330
<i>Less a capitalist,
or even a colonialist,</i>

41:24.410 --> 41:27.530
<i>Ian O'Sullivan is a barbarian.</i>

41:30.370 --> 41:32.130
<i>Killer!</i>

41:33.970 --> 41:35.810
<i>Murderer!</i>

41:35.890 --> 41:37.730
<i>You're a
disgrace to the game, man!</i>

41:37.810 --> 41:42.610
<i>- Get off the ice!
- You're a pig, O'Sullivan!</i>

41:42.690 --> 41:45.970
No! It's not true!

41:46.050 --> 41:48.490
<i>- You're a liar! 
- No!</i>

41:50.370 --> 41:54.090
It is true! All of it!

41:56.650 --> 42:01.250
Yes, I said it.
You're a monster!

42:25.890 --> 42:29.090
<i>Marcus!</i>

42:29.170 --> 42:34.930
Marcus!
It's all lies!

42:38.010 --> 42:41.450
<i>Get out of here! </i>

43:05.370 --> 43:07.490
Hello, transporter.

44:35.210 --> 44:37.770
We could do with a guy
like you for the playoffs.

44:37.850 --> 44:39.490
No, thanks.

44:41.610 --> 44:45.810
- So, that's it? It's over?
- It is for me.

44:45.890 --> 44:49.170
- What happens now?
- I go home.

44:49.250 --> 44:51.850
- Where's home?
- Far away.

44:56.490 --> 44:59.450
Planes to far away don't usually
start leaving till the morning.

44:59.530 --> 45:01.330
- So I hear.
- It'd be a shame

45:01.410 --> 45:03.890
to spend all night at the airport.

45:03.970 --> 45:06.650
I guess it would.
