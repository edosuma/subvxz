WEBVTT

00:02.800 --> 00:04.688
Thank you, Your Honor.

00:07.140 --> 00:09.131
And I'd like to thank you

00:09.170 --> 00:12.037
for your patience
and your attention.

00:13.640 --> 00:17.474
Now it's time for you to go
into that room and judge.

00:17.510 --> 00:19.717
So let's hear the facts.

00:20.850 --> 00:22.818
Jake Rickter.

00:22.850 --> 00:25.114
Family man.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.651
Business owner.

00:26.690 --> 00:28.351
You've probably seen his wife

00:28.390 --> 00:29.823
and child here
throughout the trial.

00:29.860 --> 00:34.058
So why is Jake on trial
for first degree murder?

00:34.100 --> 00:37.467
Jake's nine-year-old son died
during routine oral surgery,

00:37.500 --> 00:39.798
and a heartbroken Jake
decided to sue.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.104
That's all.

00:42.140 --> 00:44.802
Jake came to our firm, and
we helped him sue the dentist.

00:44.840 --> 00:46.671
That was a year ago.

00:46.710 --> 00:49.201
And as you know,
that suit was adjudicated

00:49.250 --> 00:51.070
by Judge Philip Ellerbee.

00:51.110 --> 00:53.169
Judge Ellerbee decided
against Jake,

00:53.220 --> 00:55.347
and that's where
all this would have ended,

00:55.380 --> 00:56.483
except two months later,

00:56.520 --> 00:59.717
Judge Ellerbee was found
stabbed to death in his home.

01:02.190 --> 01:03.782
Now why do I find myself

01:03.830 --> 01:05.286
showing you
these crime scene photos

01:05.330 --> 01:06.695
even more
than the state's attorney?

01:06.730 --> 01:11.292
Because I think this murder
crIes out for Justice.

01:11.330 --> 01:13.491
But instead, Glenn Childs,

01:13.540 --> 01:14.837
knowing his term
as state's attorney

01:14.870 --> 01:16.565
would be over in two days...

01:16.610 --> 01:17.736
Objection.

01:17.770 --> 01:19.772
Sustained.

01:19.810 --> 01:22.870
...as has been testified
to preVIously--

01:22.910 --> 01:26.846
Judge Ellerbee was wearing
both gloves that night,

01:26.880 --> 01:29.144
but as you can see
in the prosecutor's own photos,

01:29.190 --> 01:30.316
there was one missing.

01:30.350 --> 01:31.487
Police can't locate it.

01:31.520 --> 01:34.114
Glenn Childs can't locate it.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.822
(phone vibrating)
And you heard
testimony from

01:36.860 --> 01:38.521
our expert witness that,

01:38.560 --> 01:40.721
given the direction
of the knife attack,

01:40.760 --> 01:45.527
this glove would most certainly
have the killer's blood on it.

01:45.570 --> 01:48.494
And yet, the one piece of
evidence that could have led

01:48.540 --> 01:50.906
to exoneration is gone-- why?

01:50.940 --> 01:54.535
You've also heard testimony
that Judge Ellerbee was involved

01:54.580 --> 01:56.172
in several other
controversnal decrsrons,

01:56.210 --> 01:57.848
and has a multitude
of enemies,

01:57.880 --> 02:00.348
and yet, Mr. Childs here
would have you believe...

02:00.380 --> 02:02.519
Oh, hey. How'd it go?

02:02.550 --> 02:04.518
Will's doing well,
but I don't know--

02:04.550 --> 02:07.155
I think we only have one
juror, juror number two.

02:07.190 --> 02:08.157
This is hard.

02:08.190 --> 02:10.454
People want to blame someone
for a judge killing.

02:10.490 --> 02:12.799
Oh, when you get a chance,
we need to talk.

02:12.830 --> 02:15.196
About?
Nothing bad.

02:15.230 --> 02:16.527
We're expanding, and I think

02:16.570 --> 02:18.526
you should consider
taking on a bigger role.

02:18.570 --> 02:20.265
What role?

02:20.300 --> 02:21.232
We'll talk.

02:21.270 --> 02:24.398
Heading up to the thirtieth.
More office space.

02:24.440 --> 02:26.476
(phone ringing)

02:26.510 --> 02:28.933
Hi, Owen. How's parenting?

02:28.980 --> 02:30.777
Oh, it is rough.

02:30.810 --> 02:32.368
What are you watching?

02:32.420 --> 02:33.648
I'm working hard.

02:33.680 --> 02:34.874
Have you seen reality TV

02:34.920 --> 02:36.512
during the day?

02:36.550 --> 02:39.257
It is so-- I don't know--
like, last days of Pompeii.

02:39.290 --> 02:41.349
More on the Rickter
trial?
Yeah. Will's office?

02:41.390 --> 02:42.527
Nah, I'll take it.

02:42.560 --> 02:43.879
So, hey, we decided

02:43.930 --> 02:45.955
on Italian tonight at 6:00.
Are you free?

02:45.990 --> 02:47.491
I will be by then. Where?

02:47.530 --> 02:48.895
Um, Johnnie's. 6:00?

02:48.930 --> 02:50.625
Okay, I will see you then.

02:50.670 --> 02:51.796
Oh, and, Owen,

02:51.830 --> 02:52.933
thank you, by the way.

02:52.970 --> 02:55.495
Oh, no. Come on,
you're my big sis.

02:55.540 --> 02:56.837
And you know what? Don't worry.

02:56.870 --> 02:58.428
They... They seem fine.

02:58.470 --> 02:59.971
Really?
OWEN:
Yeah. You and I were

03:00.010 --> 03:01.807
catatonic when
Mom and Dad split.

03:01.840 --> 03:03.808
So you're not telling anyone?

03:03.850 --> 03:05.806
About the separation?

03:05.850 --> 03:07.841
No, not yet.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.211
Not even Will?

03:13.460 --> 03:15.416
Uh...

03:15.460 --> 03:17.485
that was a joke, Alicia.

03:17.530 --> 03:18.929
Hello?

03:21.900 --> 03:25.893
Uh... Owen, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.898
Courtney?

03:31.940 --> 03:33.976
Courtney!

03:34.010 --> 03:36.843
Get Diane.

03:36.880 --> 03:38.871
Tell her it's urgent.

03:48.920 --> 03:51.525
(phone ringing)

03:56.500 --> 03:57.922
Hey.

04:00.070 --> 04:02.664
(phone continues ringing)
Look.

04:08.810 --> 04:10.004
Okay.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.540
Don't move.
I'm not.

04:11.580 --> 04:13.411
It came in that envelope?
Yes.

04:13.450 --> 04:15.008
Keep your fingers
where they are.

04:15.050 --> 04:17.780
I am.
Courtney's getting Diane.

04:17.820 --> 04:19.856
Anybody else touch it?
The glove or
the envelope?

04:19.890 --> 04:21.949
The glove.
No, I didn't
even touch it.

04:21.990 --> 04:23.548
It just slipped right out.

04:23.590 --> 04:24.727
(phone ringing)

04:24.760 --> 04:25.988
Sophia Russo.

04:26.030 --> 04:27.019
Hey, it's me. Look,

04:27.060 --> 04:29.369
when do you start at the
State's Attorney's Office?

04:29.400 --> 04:31.721
Why? You want
to come work for me?

04:31.770 --> 04:33.533
Does your firm still
run DNA testing?

04:33.570 --> 04:34.491
Yeah. Why?

04:34.540 --> 04:36.633
We need to hire you
for a few days, but...

04:36.670 --> 04:38.399
you need to come here right now.

04:38.440 --> 04:39.998
My next call is to the police.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.928
Where?

04:41.980 --> 04:44.346
Lockhart/Gardner, 27th floor.

04:44.380 --> 04:47.042
Okay.

04:47.080 --> 04:49.640
And give me ten minutes
before you call the cops.

04:49.690 --> 04:50.884
Head out now.

04:50.920 --> 04:53.013
Who was that?

04:53.060 --> 04:54.482
A friend.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.056
(phone ringing)

04:57.090 --> 04:59.456
That's probably Will.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.024
Jury instruction just ended.

05:01.060 --> 05:02.823
Yeah?

05:02.870 --> 05:04.497
Is Alicia there?

05:04.530 --> 05:05.963
Uh, she can't talk right now.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.093
Just tell her...

05:08.140 --> 05:11.007
I'll call her later.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.076
Where's the candidate's head
about this?
Running again?

05:13.110 --> 05:14.031
He's not there yet.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.071
He wants to make a good show

05:16.110 --> 05:17.077
with the State's
Attorney's Office.

05:17.110 --> 05:19.578
Good. Well, he shouldn't
think about any of this.

05:19.620 --> 05:20.973
That's our job.
And yours.

05:21.020 --> 05:22.988
In the meantime, Eli,
make yourself comfortable.

05:23.020 --> 05:25.739
Democratic Committee
takes care of Its own.

05:25.790 --> 05:28.088
Good. I like
being taken care of.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.452
(laughter)

05:30.490 --> 05:31.422
We have some law firms

05:31.460 --> 05:33.553
who will give you office
space and a salary.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.488
We need to get you paid
between the campaigns.

05:35.530 --> 05:38.419
And you need to take this
time to think statewide.

05:38.470 --> 05:41.496
Illinois's more conservative
than you might think.

05:41.540 --> 05:43.531
We'll need Peter
at family events

05:43.570 --> 05:44.969
with his kids, his wife.

05:45.010 --> 05:46.409
Especially the wife.

05:46.440 --> 05:47.600
You should see
the polling

05:47.640 --> 05:49.904
on Mrs._Florrick
after her interVIew.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.747
I don't think
she's going to want

05:51.780 --> 05:53.111
to get too involved again.

05:53.150 --> 05:54.708
(chuckling)

05:54.750 --> 05:56.980
Oh, I don't think that's
her choice, is it?

05:57.020 --> 05:58.988
Look, without her,
Peter's a john

05:59.020 --> 06:00.988
who overpaid for
a prostitute.

06:01.020 --> 06:02.954
With her, he's Kennedy.

06:02.990 --> 06:06.027
JUDGE SUZANNE MORRIS:
And now we leave it
in your hands.

06:06.060 --> 06:08.893
If you have any questions,
Petie will be at your door.

06:08.930 --> 06:10.727
Thank you.
(gavelbangs)

06:21.080 --> 06:23.048
You okay?

06:23.080 --> 06:24.547
Yeah.

06:24.580 --> 06:26.719
I don't want to lose them.

06:26.750 --> 06:29.014
No matter what the jury does,

06:29.050 --> 06:31.086
we'll appeal.

06:32.120 --> 06:34.884
A kid should make it easier.

06:36.060 --> 06:38.153
It just makes it harder.

06:38.190 --> 06:39.179
(phone ringing)

06:39.230 --> 06:41.619
I'll call you tonight.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.867
Hey. What's wrong?

06:44.900 --> 06:46.162
Where?

06:46.200 --> 06:47.565
No, I'll come to you.

06:47.600 --> 06:48.999
Just give me... 20 minutes.

06:49.040 --> 06:50.462
SOPHIA:
This is a tough one.

06:50.510 --> 06:52.205
You have no
chain of custody.

06:52.240 --> 06:53.901
KALINDA:
It could be a prank.

06:53.940 --> 06:56.170
Mm, or it could be someone
from the police department

06:56.210 --> 06:57.609
who didn't like the way
this went down.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.618
A whistle-blower?

06:59.650 --> 07:01.914
Yeah. I mean,
the State's Attorney's Office

07:01.950 --> 07:03.542
is in transition--
anything goes.

07:03.590 --> 07:04.943
(phone ringing)

07:04.990 --> 07:07.709
WIL|__:
What's g0ing on?
I got eight calls.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.113
Yeah, we have an issue here.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.185
The glove. It was sent
to our office.

07:11.230 --> 07:12.652
What?

07:12.700 --> 07:13.951
The judge's glove.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.150
It's sitting on Alicia's desk
right now.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.020
I... Who sent it?

07:18.070 --> 07:19.196
We don't know.
We phoned the police.

07:19.230 --> 07:22.097
They're a few minutes away.
You need to get to the judge.

07:22.140 --> 07:23.698
They'll say we created it.

07:23.740 --> 07:25.605
They'll say
there's no chain of custody.

07:25.640 --> 07:27.471
I know. Get to the judge.

07:32.250 --> 07:35.515
One second.
Wait one second!

07:35.550 --> 07:37.882
Guys, just give us
one minute, please.

07:37.920 --> 07:39.046
Thanks.

07:39.090 --> 07:42.116
(panﬁng)

07:42.160 --> 07:44.924
Jake, I'm sorry
to ask you this,

07:44.960 --> 07:47.099
but I don't have time
to be diplomatic.

07:47.130 --> 07:50.122
Is there a chance your blood
is on the missing glove?

07:50.170 --> 07:52.798
The...? What?

07:52.840 --> 07:54.535
The bloody glove.

07:54.570 --> 07:56.094
There's a chance
we have it.

07:56.140 --> 07:57.960
Could your blood be on it?

07:58.010 --> 08:01.901
No... No.

08:03.180 --> 08:05.171
Okay.
I just needed to ask.

08:05.210 --> 08:08.270
What's going on?

08:08.320 --> 08:10.743
If, hypothetically,
we were worried

08:10.790 --> 08:13.156
about_ evidence
collection here...

08:13.190 --> 08:14.282
KALIN DA:
With the blood?

08:14.320 --> 08:16.686
DIANE:
Yes. Not that it'll be lost,

08:16.730 --> 08:18.129
but the crime lab
is backlogged,

08:18.160 --> 08:20.151
and they'll have
no incentive to rush this.

08:24.330 --> 08:27.834
What are we
thinking here?

08:27.870 --> 08:30.065
What do you want me
to be thinking?

08:30.110 --> 08:32.601
How long will it take
your firm to run DNA?

08:32.640 --> 08:34.301
PRC testing?
That's 24 hours.

08:34.340 --> 08:36.501
It's gonna cost you.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.275
And we need
something to test.

08:41.920 --> 08:45.549
And the memo is privileged
Lockhart/Gardner work product.

08:45.590 --> 08:47.785
That memo with the
dried blood on it?

08:47.820 --> 08:49.117
Mm-hmm.

08:49.160 --> 08:50.821
Have you called the police?

08:50.860 --> 08:53.021
Yeah. They'll be
here in seconds.

09:01.900 --> 09:04.300
WILL:
How many times are you
gonna say that?

09:04.340 --> 09:05.159
Come on, Glenn.
GLENN:
...what I understand.

09:05.210 --> 09:06.302
Your Honor, please,
this is insane.

09:06.340 --> 09:08.979
I mean, ten minutes after
the jury's instructed, Will?

09:09.010 --> 09:11.342
I can't control when evidence
is sent to me, Glenn.

09:11.380 --> 09:13.712
But you can control
when you send it to yourself.

09:13.750 --> 09:15.217
Oh, you're saying
I created this?!
Absolutely.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.808
WILL: Give me a break!
CORY: You're, like,
ten years old!

09:16.850 --> 09:19.239
Okay. Yes,
everybody's indignant.

09:19.290 --> 09:21.918
Mr. Gardner has a
point, Mr. Childs.

09:21.960 --> 09:25.088
I myself have witnessed
prosecutorial misconduct.

09:25.130 --> 09:26.597
Meaning what, Your Honor?

09:26.630 --> 09:28.996
But... Mr. Gardner,

09:29.030 --> 09:30.361
the jury's
deliberating.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.197
Yes, and we would ask
for a mistrial.

09:32.230 --> 09:33.265
Oh, come on!
It's ridiculous!

09:33.300 --> 09:35.336
We were not given access
to exculpatory evidence--

09:35.370 --> 09:36.132
a clear Brady violation.

09:36.170 --> 09:37.307
Excuse me.
It's not our eVIdence.

09:37.340 --> 09:38.659
We don't even
know what it is!

09:38.710 --> 09:41.338
Thank you, everyone.

09:41.380 --> 09:43.871
Mr. Gardner, your motion
for a mistrial is denied,

09:43.910 --> 09:47.346
but bring me proof that
this glove is the glove,

09:47.380 --> 09:50.986
that it has been purposefully
kept from you,

09:51.020 --> 09:52.954
or that _it has
some probative impact,

09:52.990 --> 09:54.355
and I will reconsider.
Thank you.

09:54.390 --> 09:56.881
ALL:
Thank you, Your Honor.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.955
Mr. Gardner?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.696
I'm your friend here.

10:02.730 --> 10:05.324
You won't have many friends
in appellate court.

10:05.370 --> 10:06.689
I know.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.367
No, I don't
think you do.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.630
Judges protect their own.

10:10.670 --> 10:13.332
They won't be tempted
to reverse a guilty verdict.

10:20.280 --> 10:22.271
What do you suggest?

10:22.320 --> 10:26.108
Well, ifI were
in a suggesting mood,

10:26.150 --> 10:31.053
I would suggest
that you use your time wisely,

10:31.090 --> 10:34.321
because when that jury comes in,
it's out of my hands.

10:34.360 --> 10:37.363
Thank you, Your Honor.

10:41.040 --> 10:44.237
We have until the jury comes in.

10:57.450 --> 10:58.439
DIANE:
Well, to say the least,

10:58.490 --> 11:00.856
we've had a dramatic turn
of events recently, so,

11:00.890 --> 11:03.358
we're having the blood on
the glove tested independently,

11:03.390 --> 11:06.427
and we should have
the results tomorrow.

11:06.460 --> 11:08.291
In the meantime--
three prongs.

11:08.330 --> 11:10.264
Keep tabs
on the jury's progress.

11:10.300 --> 11:13.167
When the jury comes in,
our clock runs out.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.861
WILL:
I'm on it.

11:14.900 --> 11:16.060
I know the sheriff.
Good.

11:16.100 --> 11:17.237
The second prong--

11:17.270 --> 11:18.237
the state's attorney.

11:18.270 --> 11:20.477
He can stop this case
based on new evidence,

11:20.510 --> 11:22.478
but Glenn Childs won't.
It's his swan song.

11:22.510 --> 11:25.274
So we need to get
to the new state's attorney,

11:25.310 --> 11:30.111
and prep him
on Childs' intransigence.

11:31.490 --> 11:33.287
I'll talk to him.
I'm at the courthouse anyway.

11:33.320 --> 11:37.723
DIANE: Good. The third prong--
Who is the whistle-blower?

11:37.760 --> 11:39.182
The police said they would check

11:39.230 --> 11:40.026
the fingerprints
on the envelope,

11:40.060 --> 11:42.119
but given the usual
crime lab delays,

11:42.160 --> 11:44.128
I wouldn't expect
anything fast.

11:44.170 --> 11:47.139
So, how did
this envelope get to us?

11:47.170 --> 11:48.068
It's not the envelope.

11:48.100 --> 11:49.397
What?

11:49.440 --> 11:53.809
The envelope the police
collected is not the envelope.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.171
What do you mean?

12:09.290 --> 12:11.929
Bob, the delivery pouch
for Will Gardner--

12:11.960 --> 12:14.019
did you open it?

12:14.060 --> 12:15.391
The one an hour ago?

12:15.430 --> 12:16.897
Yeah. Why?

12:16.930 --> 12:18.921
Where is it?

12:20.900 --> 12:23.835
Well, you just can't
stay away, can you?

12:23.870 --> 12:25.201
You'll test it
for prints?
Sure.

12:25.240 --> 12:27.037
Why not?
What else have I got to do?

12:27.080 --> 12:29.139
You want me to do_ some random
urine testing while I'm at it?

12:29.180 --> 12:32.502
No, but it's a long day yet.

12:32.550 --> 12:37.010
Hey, you still get
a drink after work?

12:37.050 --> 12:39.780
Do 1...? Yeah.

12:39.820 --> 12:42.948
Where?

12:42.990 --> 12:44.184
Hey, good job on the envelope.

12:44.230 --> 12:45.424
I'm heading
to the courthouse now.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.927
You going
through suspects?

12:46.960 --> 12:48.097
Yes. Trying to find DNA

12:48.130 --> 12:49.961
to compare with the glove.
But Will...

12:50.000 --> 12:51.126
(elevator bell dings)

12:51.170 --> 12:53.263
Yes?

12:53.300 --> 12:55.063
Ride down with me.

12:55.100 --> 12:56.397
Oh.

12:58.270 --> 12:59.999
When you talk to Peter...

13:00.040 --> 13:01.177
Don't worry.
We'll be fine.

13:01.210 --> 13:04.304
No, no, I know.
It's just...

13:06.080 --> 13:07.911
There might be tension.

13:07.950 --> 13:09.884
I just don't want you
to be unprepared.

13:09.920 --> 13:12.138
For...?

13:14.320 --> 13:17.357
We've been having some...
troubles.

13:17.390 --> 13:20.291
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:20.330 --> 13:21.126
No, no, don't be.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.822
It's, um, it's
a long time coming.

13:23.870 --> 13:26.361
Alicia, I'm sorry.

13:28.470 --> 13:29.960
He thinks...?

13:30.010 --> 13:33.104
No, no. It's nothing.
I'm over-worrying it.

13:33.140 --> 13:34.129
(bell dings)

13:36.380 --> 13:37.574
It'll be fine.

13:37.610 --> 13:39.498
You all right?

13:39.550 --> 13:40.847
We'll talk.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.438
I have to look
through some cases.

13:45.390 --> 13:47.881
ELI:
The Democratic Committee has
given me my pick

13:47.920 --> 13:52.027
of Chicago firms to set up my
political consulting shingle,

13:52.060 --> 13:54.392
but I know
you're expanding here.

13:54.430 --> 13:56.489
I also know that

13:56.530 --> 13:58.293
one of your most
valuable clients,

13:58.330 --> 14:01.299
Patrick Edelstein, took
his lobbying business

14:01.340 --> 14:03.069
to Greybridge Associates

14:03.110 --> 14:04.600
because you had
nothing in-house.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.335
You're offering your services?

14:06.370 --> 14:10.147
I'm offering you the chance
to vie for my services.

14:10.180 --> 14:11.249
Really?

14:11.280 --> 14:14.113
And why do we warrant this...

14:14.150 --> 14:15.447
largesse?

14:15.480 --> 14:17.539
I think of you and
Will as family.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.114
(chuckles)

14:19.150 --> 14:20.253
This is confidential,

14:20.290 --> 14:24.488
but I want to run my first
campaign in-house from here:

14:24.530 --> 14:26.657
Peter Florrick for Governor.

14:26.690 --> 14:29.625
With Mrs. Florrick here,

14:29.660 --> 14:31.992
it feels like
the perfect fit.

14:32.030 --> 14:36.296
Yes... a strangely
perfect fit.

14:36.340 --> 14:37.307
Okay, these are our suspects.

14:37.340 --> 14:39.501
Every civil case Judge Ellerbee
presided over

14:39.540 --> 14:41.030
in the last five years.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.399
It's too much DNA
to collect,

14:42.440 --> 14:43.577
so we need
to prioritize.

14:44.710 --> 14:45.677
Sal Barberini.

14:45.710 --> 14:48.178
His construction business lost
a federal bid.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.517
He sued.

14:49.550 --> 14:51.211
Judge Ellerbee decided
against him.

14:51.250 --> 14:52.080
And...?

14:52.120 --> 14:55.214
And Barberini has
a history of violence.

14:55.260 --> 14:56.284
Criminal record?

14:56.320 --> 14:57.321
No.

14:57.360 --> 14:58.452
Okay, I'll get to him,

14:58.490 --> 15:01.027
see ifI can get
a DNA sample.

15:01.060 --> 15:03.563
(phone ringing)

15:03.600 --> 15:05.261
Hey, did you get anything?

15:05.300 --> 15:08.030
You got two sets of prints on
the envelope.

15:08.070 --> 15:09.332
Two with IAFIS matches?

15:09.370 --> 15:13.431
Yeah. One's an ex-con,
the other's ex-military.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.970
No cops?

15:15.010 --> 15:18.241
No. Either your whistle-blower
was wearing gloves

15:18.280 --> 15:19.975
or he's an_ _ex-con
or ex-military.

15:20.020 --> 15:23.547
I'm not here.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.717
You're not here?

15:25.750 --> 15:28.981
I'm not here officially.

15:29.020 --> 15:30.521
Yes, but you will
be here.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.380
All I'm saying is
this case was mishandled.

15:32.430 --> 15:34.125
Childs wants to go out
with a bang,

15:34.160 --> 15:35.593
so he's not thinking
rationally.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.334
What is rationally?

15:42.370 --> 15:45.999
Well, if there is other blood
on this judge's glove,

15:46.040 --> 15:48.133
then maybe it'll point
to the real killer.

15:48.180 --> 15:49.499
And this glove just
wound up on your desk?

15:49.540 --> 15:51.440
Alicia's desk.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.513
Oh, Alicia's desk.

15:57.020 --> 15:59.409
I just find it odd
that it should appear

15:59.450 --> 16:00.712
at such an opportune moment.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.387
Well, it's not that opportune.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.524
The jury is deliberating.
Look, just so I'm clear...

16:04.560 --> 16:06.528
I think you're making yourself
perfectly clear, Will.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.551
You're asking me
to get involved in a case

16:08.600 --> 16:10.465
that might have been mishandled
by Glenn Childs.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.525
Yes, and might embarrass him.

16:12.570 --> 16:16.529
And I'm saying I'll look into it
when I'm in office.

16:16.570 --> 16:17.468
Mr. Florrick?

16:20.410 --> 16:22.537
Yeah. Okay?

16:25.180 --> 16:26.477
Things are good, right?

16:28.520 --> 16:29.544
Good?

16:29.580 --> 16:31.081
Yes. Why wouldn't they be?

16:31.120 --> 16:33.156
I don't know.

16:33.190 --> 16:36.512
Well, then they probably are.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.686
How's Alicia?

16:40.600 --> 16:42.090
Good.

16:42.130 --> 16:43.495
She's doing well.

16:43.530 --> 16:46.328
At work?

16:46.370 --> 16:49.168
Yes.

16:51.270 --> 16:54.808
It will be funny to be on
the opposite side in court.

16:54.840 --> 16:57.707
It will.

16:59.580 --> 17:03.186
But not laugh-out—loud funny.

17:14.130 --> 17:15.597
(quietly):
Will.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.388
You said you wanted me
to tell you

17:20.440 --> 17:22.135
when there was some sign
from the jury.

17:22.170 --> 17:23.660
The judge wants them to work
through dinner.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.508
Good.
No, but they said
they don't need dinner.

17:28.540 --> 17:29.632
Got it. Thanks.

17:32.110 --> 17:34.214
We got a problem here.

17:34.250 --> 17:35.547
Petie!

17:37.550 --> 17:38.710
Serve them coffee.

17:38.750 --> 17:41.287
Serve them lots of coffee.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.481
Why? You wanna
keep them awake?

17:43.530 --> 17:45.327
Looks like the jury's
coming in soon.

17:45.360 --> 17:46.759
We're running out of time.
Where are you?

17:46.790 --> 17:48.394
KALINDA:
I'm talking to Sal Barberini.

17:48.430 --> 17:49.852
...I'm in construction,

17:49.900 --> 17:51.424
that I'm automatically
Mobbed up.

17:51.470 --> 17:52.823
Will, let me
call you back.

17:52.870 --> 17:53.859
Italian-Americans have
contributed

17:53.900 --> 17:55.197
to the backbone
of America,

17:55.240 --> 17:56.639
and this is
the crap we get?

17:56.670 --> 17:58.501
Listen, I'm just asking
you what you did

17:58.540 --> 18:00.132
on the night of
the judge's murder.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.636
I told the cops already!

18:01.680 --> 18:03.648
I don't hold a grudge!

18:03.680 --> 18:05.807
What I did say was that
I thought the judge was

18:05.850 --> 18:07.647
a little disrespectful
for delaying court

18:07.680 --> 18:09.568
because of a
personal matter.

18:09.620 --> 18:12.646
Joe DiMaggio--
Italian-American.

18:12.690 --> 18:14.612
Bank of America,
ever hear of that?

18:14.660 --> 18:16.309
Started by
Italian-Americans.

18:16.360 --> 18:17.520
What personal matters?

18:17.560 --> 18:18.720
I don't know.

18:18.760 --> 18:21.149
Something with his daughter
and his family.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.668
What are you?
What?

18:23.700 --> 18:25.895
Persian? What if I looked
at you and said,

18:25.930 --> 18:27.397
"Oh, yeah,
she's a terrorist!"

18:27.440 --> 18:30.739
No, I'm looking for a current
address, ma'am,

18:30.770 --> 18:33.603
of an ex-convict
named Robert Clayton.

18:33.640 --> 18:37.906
Robert--
No, Robert Clayton.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.599
Um, Alicia...

18:39.650 --> 18:41.515
what are you looking for?

18:41.550 --> 18:43.814
An ex-con whose fingerprints
are on the envelope.

18:43.850 --> 18:46.410
Why?

18:48.360 --> 18:49.588
Bob, what's your last name?

18:49.620 --> 18:50.655
Clayton.

18:50.690 --> 18:52.521
Why?

18:53.560 --> 18:55.494
Why? What's the problem?

18:55.530 --> 18:56.656
What'd I do?

18:58.630 --> 19:00.530
Oh, no.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.436
Why not Buddhism?

19:05.470 --> 19:06.607
Buddhists love the gays.

19:06.640 --> 19:07.777
Christians don't dislike gays.

19:07.810 --> 19:10.244
Can we please talk about
something other than religion?

19:10.280 --> 19:11.349
(phone ringing)

19:11.380 --> 19:13.348
Here it comes.

19:13.380 --> 19:15.644
The obligatory apology.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.545
But I mean,
she works hard

19:17.590 --> 19:18.909
because she has
to work hard.

19:18.950 --> 19:22.283
Hi, sis.

19:22.320 --> 19:25.221
No, no, no,
we, we understand.

19:25.260 --> 19:26.158
Yeah, we're just...

19:26.190 --> 19:30.524
Yes, we will order you
some pasta to go.

19:30.570 --> 19:33.266
Oh, they're fine.
Just...

19:33.300 --> 19:35.268
Yeah, go save a life.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.597
Owen, look at you. Hello.

19:36.640 --> 19:39.200
Jackie!
Kids, look who it is.

19:39.240 --> 19:40.878
It's, it's
your grandmother.

19:40.910 --> 19:42.775
What a-- oh,
what a coincidence.

19:42.810 --> 19:44.402
Well, not really.

19:44.450 --> 19:46.805
I must confess, this was our
usual Wednesday night dinner,

19:46.850 --> 19:48.670
so I thought I'd come to see

19:48.720 --> 19:50.210
if you were keeping
the tradition alive.

19:50.250 --> 19:51.387
How nice.

19:51.420 --> 19:52.387
Grace, look at you.
You're...

19:52.420 --> 19:53.978
so pretty.

19:54.020 --> 19:56.511
Zach, taller and taller.

19:56.560 --> 19:59.927
Would you mind if I join you
for a brief second?

19:59.960 --> 20:00.995
Sure. Of course.

20:01.030 --> 20:02.452
DIANE:
Kalinda got his DNA,

20:02.500 --> 20:04.695
but she doesn't think Sal
Barberini did it.

20:04.730 --> 20:06.891
Really.
Construction? Italian?

20:06.930 --> 20:08.488
Did she talk to him?

20:08.540 --> 20:09.632
Uh, yes.

20:09.670 --> 20:12.309
Also, one of the two sets
of prints on the envelope,

20:12.340 --> 20:13.409
they came from our mailroom.

20:13.440 --> 20:14.600
They what?

20:14.640 --> 20:17.700
Yes. Did you know we have
a sex offender in our mailroom?

20:17.750 --> 20:19.342
The baritone
at the Christmas party.

20:19.380 --> 20:22.872
I... Okay, I...

20:22.920 --> 20:24.979
I can't process that just yet.

20:25.020 --> 20:26.612
I'm at the door.

20:26.650 --> 20:29.756
I just saw one go in.
Ask me about the case.

20:29.790 --> 20:31.985
Oh, the case?
Yeah, how is Jake doing?

20:32.030 --> 20:34.453
Jake Rickter? Good.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.695
He's optimistic now that we have
a new suspect.

20:36.730 --> 20:38.322
Oh, really?

20:38.370 --> 20:39.769
Uh-huh. That's good to know.

20:39.800 --> 20:42.633
He needed a break, and this
missing glove is it.

20:42.670 --> 20:46.731
Now we just need
to compare the DNA.

20:46.770 --> 20:51.343
Oh, no. Oh, no.

20:51.380 --> 20:53.416
Your Honor, I am admitting
a mistake here.

20:53.450 --> 20:55.748
I'm sorry, Your Honor, but
a juror overheard my remarks on

20:55.780 --> 20:57.714
a call to my partner.
I'm admitting a problem.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.445
A problem of your
own making, Will!

20:59.490 --> 21:01.651
He wants to eject this juror
so the jury will have

21:01.690 --> 21:02.816
to start deliberations
all over again.

21:02.860 --> 21:03.884
Oh, God,
are you paranoid!

21:03.930 --> 21:05.818
Sometimes things
just happen!

21:05.860 --> 21:08.693
Even given that, Mr. Childs,
I don't know what other option

21:08.730 --> 21:11.790
I have than to replace him
with an alternate.

21:11.830 --> 21:13.832
We would urge Your Honor
to sanction Mr. Gardner.

21:13.870 --> 21:16.532
I will resist that temptation.

21:16.570 --> 21:20.438
But I do understand_that there
was a second juror

21:20.480 --> 21:23.540
in a bathroom stall.

21:23.580 --> 21:25.309
You didn't know that,
Mr. Gardner?

21:25.350 --> 21:27.614
No, Your Honor.

21:27.650 --> 21:29.641
Peﬁe?

21:29.680 --> 21:30.749
And again I apologize
to this court,

21:30.790 --> 21:33.008
but are we_ sure
the other juror
overheard me?

21:33.050 --> 21:34.381
Juror Number Two,

21:34.420 --> 21:36.911
did you hear
Mr. Gardner here

21:36.960 --> 21:38.587
discussing the case
in the restroom?

21:38.630 --> 21:39.654
Yes, Your Honor.

21:39.690 --> 21:42.955
Then, regrettably,
I must excuse you, Juror Two.

21:44.570 --> 21:46.492
Gentlemen, we will
commence deliberations

21:46.530 --> 21:48.339
tomorrow morning with
the two alternates.

21:48.370 --> 21:50.406
Good night.

21:50.440 --> 21:51.998
My, my!
You got here fast.

21:52.040 --> 21:54.372
Is it raining?
No.

21:54.410 --> 21:55.809
You got something
on the DNA?

21:55.840 --> 21:58.877
Yeah, preliminary
PRC report on the
blood on the glove.

21:58.910 --> 22:00.810
Not my problem.
How do you like mysteries?

22:00.850 --> 22:02.408
Not much.

22:02.450 --> 22:03.940
You're no fun.

22:03.990 --> 22:06.049
Who are your suspects
for killing this judge?

22:06.090 --> 22:08.558
They're mostly men, right?
Yeah. Why?

22:08.590 --> 22:10.751
That's too bad.
DNA's female.

22:19.130 --> 22:20.893
Look, it might mean nothing,

22:20.940 --> 22:24.603
but we think this DNA could
possibly lead to the killer.

22:24.640 --> 22:26.733
Oh, my God.

22:26.770 --> 22:28.977
I just don't want you
to get your hopes up.

22:29.010 --> 22:30.875
Why not?

22:30.910 --> 22:32.946
What do you want me
to do with my hopes?

22:36.480 --> 22:39.540
The jury starts deliberating
tomorrow, with alternates.

22:39.590 --> 22:42.388
So we bought some time.

22:42.420 --> 22:44.888
Once it goes to appeals,
it gets more difficult, okay?

22:44.930 --> 22:46.852
Did you see
your son tonight?

22:46.890 --> 22:47.959
Yeah.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.628
Danny won a spelling bee.

22:50.670 --> 22:51.762
Really!

22:51.800 --> 22:53.495
He's smarter
than I am.

22:53.540 --> 22:55.394
And stronger.

22:58.070 --> 23:01.779
I don't know what I would do
if my dad were in prison.

23:01.810 --> 23:04.142
But definitely
wouldn't be winning

23:04.180 --> 23:07.411
any spelling bees.

23:07.450 --> 23:09.509
(phone ringing)

23:12.220 --> 23:14.415
Work?

23:14.460 --> 23:15.779
Yeah.

23:15.820 --> 23:17.651
Mm... (clicking tongue)

23:17.690 --> 23:19.726
You used to be
more fun.

23:19.760 --> 23:21.057
Yeah.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.660
(laughs)

23:23.700 --> 23:25.588
Maybe it was me.

23:25.630 --> 23:27.495
Maybe I was the one
that was more fun.

23:27.540 --> 23:30.566
No, no, no, no, no.
It was me.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.076
Miss me?

23:39.080 --> 23:40.479
Now you gotta kiss me.

23:45.050 --> 23:46.688
(phone ringing)

23:46.720 --> 23:48.711
Mmm... That's mine.

23:54.730 --> 23:57.494
Yeah.

23:57.530 --> 24:00.067
Yeah.

24:00.100 --> 24:02.534
VVhen?

24:02.570 --> 24:03.832
Okay.

24:03.870 --> 24:06.134
No, I'll be there.
Love you.

24:08.810 --> 24:09.902
I have an hour.

24:13.150 --> 24:14.947
Who was that?
That was my husband.

24:14.980 --> 24:17.016
I have to go pick him up
at the airport.

24:17.050 --> 24:19.689
He was calling to remind me.

24:19.720 --> 24:22.052
I didn't know
you were married.

24:22.090 --> 24:24.024
Yes, you did.

24:24.060 --> 24:26.085
No, I didn't.

24:26.130 --> 24:29.054
Kalinda, at the
State's Attorney's Office,

24:29.100 --> 24:31.022
I showed you his picture.

24:31.070 --> 24:34.961
Griffin--
at the North Korean border.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.504
What? He's not going
to come find you and shoot you.

24:38.540 --> 24:41.771
I have to go to work.

24:41.810 --> 24:44.870
Did you become born again
or something?

24:44.910 --> 24:48.141
No, I... I have to go to work.

24:48.180 --> 24:50.171
Okay.

25:00.160 --> 25:03.618
WILL:
Kalinda.

25:03.670 --> 25:06.093
Okay, where are we
on suspects?

25:06.130 --> 25:07.893
Well, on the case,
nowhere,

25:07.940 --> 25:09.737
but I think we should
look outside of them.

25:09.770 --> 25:11.032
"Outside_of them"
meaning...?

25:11.070 --> 25:12.958
Well, Barberini mentioned
how Judge Ellerbee

25:13.010 --> 25:15.205
kept interrupting the case
because of a family emergency--

25:15.240 --> 25:16.935
something to do
with his daughter.

25:16.980 --> 25:19.107
I checked.
She's in rehab in Arizona.

25:19.150 --> 25:20.640
So not cases,
family problems?

25:20.680 --> 25:23.217
Maybe. Ellerbee
went down to see her,

25:23.250 --> 25:24.945
but she wouldn't
see him.
Why?

25:24.990 --> 25:27.311
I don't know, but
this was a month
before he was killed.

25:27.350 --> 25:29.079
At least it fits
with the female DNA.

25:29.120 --> 25:30.417
We're not finding
any other cases

25:30.460 --> 25:33.156
with disgruntled females?
Not around the time
of the murder.

25:33.190 --> 25:34.919
Where is she now,
the daughter?
In town.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.222
Well, then you two
go question her.

25:36.260 --> 25:39.058
Um, well...

25:39.100 --> 25:41.568
actually, Alicia's on the
military fingerprints
on the envelope.

25:41.600 --> 25:44.763
We traced them
to the post office

25:44.810 --> 25:47.028
two blocks from the
State's Attorney's Office.

25:47.070 --> 25:49.231
Great, so we think the
whistle-blower was an ASA?

25:49.280 --> 25:50.747
That's the thinking.
I was going to go check.

25:50.780 --> 25:51.804
DIANE:
No, I'll take that.

25:51.850 --> 25:54.114
You two go question
the daughter.

26:05.990 --> 26:08.151
Hi, we...
Miss Ellerbee, we want...

26:10.230 --> 26:12.619
_ We wanted...
We just wanted to quest...

26:12.670 --> 26:14.729
Yeah?

26:14.770 --> 26:16.294
My dad was just
such a hypocrite.

26:16.340 --> 26:19.730
Coming down to Phoenix like
he could change the world.

26:19.770 --> 26:21.909
The only reason he sent me
to Arizona in the first place

26:21.940 --> 26:23.237
was 'cause he didn't
want his judge friends

26:23.280 --> 26:24.941
knowing he had
a junkie daughter.

26:24.980 --> 26:26.948
Did the police question
you after the murder?

26:26.980 --> 26:28.174
Oh, yeah.

26:28.220 --> 26:30.176
But I had an alibi.
But you held a grudge,

26:30.220 --> 26:31.949
didn't you, Melissa?

26:31.990 --> 26:35.756
I just hated the way everybody
treated him like a saint

26:35.790 --> 26:37.348
when he was taking
bribes left and right.

26:37.390 --> 26:39.187
Is your friend all right?

26:39.230 --> 26:41.755
Hello?
Yeah, I'll be
out in a second.

26:47.740 --> 26:50.800
We have some blood from the
crime scene, and we were hoping

26:50.840 --> 26:52.307
to exclude you
as a suspect.

26:52.340 --> 26:54.228
So if we could just take
a small swab from your mouth...
No.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.929
It's non-intrusive.

26:55.980 --> 26:57.845
My body is a temple.

26:59.180 --> 27:01.740
And you're not getting
anything from it.

27:15.830 --> 27:19.220
No.
The postal worker
identified you.

27:19.270 --> 27:21.738
A postal worker
identified me

27:21.770 --> 27:24.068
as the person who brought him
that envelope?

27:24.110 --> 27:27.261
No. I showed him
photos of ASAs.

27:27.310 --> 27:30.336
And he recognized you
as someone

27:30.380 --> 27:33.304
who brought a package to the
post office that day.

27:33.350 --> 27:35.238
That is an air-tight case.

27:35.280 --> 27:39.444
He said you would have
received a receipt
just like this.

27:39.490 --> 27:42.755
My guess is
you still have it.

27:42.790 --> 27:44.951
Unless you shredded it.

27:44.990 --> 27:47.220
Just tell us,

27:47.260 --> 27:50.229
who's trying
to hide the glove? Childs?

27:50.260 --> 27:52.967
That's just kind
of odd of me, isn't it?

27:53.000 --> 27:55.764
Prosecuting Jake Rickter
and at the same time

27:55.800 --> 27:59.463
I'm secretly slipping you
information to help free him.

27:59.510 --> 28:02.035
An honored tradition, Cary.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.241
The transition dump.

28:04.280 --> 28:07.306
Every time there's a
state's attorney turnover

28:07.350 --> 28:09.375
little skeletons in the closet
get kicked out the door,

28:09.420 --> 28:11.285
so they don't blow up
in the face

28:11.320 --> 28:12.912
of the new state's attorney.

28:12.950 --> 28:15.089
And excuse the
mixed metaphor,

28:15.120 --> 28:17.054
but sometimes
they seem most apt.

28:17.090 --> 28:19.388
Well, as flattering
as this is--

28:19.430 --> 28:21.853
or maybe that's
not the right word--

28:21.900 --> 28:23.458
as offensive as this is,

28:23.500 --> 28:25.365
I would never jeopardize
a job that I love

28:25.400 --> 28:27.732
and a case that
I believe in.

28:27.770 --> 28:30.193
In the pursuit of truth?
I have a niece

28:30.240 --> 28:34.074
and I sent her a University
of Michigan T-shirt

28:34.110 --> 28:36.101
in an envelope,
and that envelope

28:36.140 --> 28:38.847
was about, hmm,
it was about yay big.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.940
That's why your
postal worker saw me
and that's why you need

28:41.980 --> 28:43.311
to keep looking
for your leaker.

28:43.350 --> 28:45.386
Come on, Cary, help us.

28:45.420 --> 28:47.786
(chuckles)

28:47.820 --> 28:50.789
Oh, it is always a
pleasure, Ms. Lockhart.

28:57.430 --> 29:00.467
DIANE:
Sorry to keep
you waiting.

29:00.500 --> 29:02.036
What a day.

29:08.210 --> 29:10.269
We found the daughter's works,

29:10.310 --> 29:13.143
and we're comparing the
blood on the syringe
with the DNA, but...

29:13.180 --> 29:15.273
You don't think it'll pan out?

29:15.320 --> 29:16.878
I don't know.

29:16.920 --> 29:19.184
The daughter was talking about
her dad taking bribes,

29:19.220 --> 29:22.189
and I'm wondering if
he was hiding something.

29:22.220 --> 29:25.018
Oh, good.
Probably worth a look.

29:25.060 --> 29:26.357
Please.

29:26.390 --> 29:30.292
You have a good relationship
with Eli Gold, don't you?

29:30.330 --> 29:32.321
I do.
Ithoughtso.

29:32.370 --> 29:34.292
I like him.

29:34.340 --> 29:36.137
Me, too.

29:36.170 --> 29:39.230
We want you to liaison
with his department.

29:39.270 --> 29:40.931
His...?

29:40.980 --> 29:44.905
As part of our expansion,
we're thinking of bringing

29:44.950 --> 29:47.942
his consultation and
lobbying firm in-house.

29:47.980 --> 29:49.049
Here?

29:49.080 --> 29:50.411
Yes.

29:50.450 --> 29:52.384
And we want you
to be the bridge

29:52.420 --> 29:53.910
between the legal
and the political.

29:55.620 --> 29:58.088
You seem startled.

29:58.130 --> 29:59.927
It just seems so...

29:59.960 --> 30:01.450
Incestuous?

30:01.500 --> 30:04.389
No, sudden.

30:04.430 --> 30:05.397
Oh, well.

30:05.430 --> 30:06.692
(laughing)

30:06.730 --> 30:10.359
The path to the corner
office is always sudden--
and incestuous.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.402
Grab the chances
when they come

30:12.440 --> 30:14.579
because they don't
come again.

30:14.610 --> 30:16.009
Yes, I just...

30:16.040 --> 30:17.849
WILL:
We got a problem.
Of course we do.

30:17.880 --> 30:19.472
The jury just called
for the judge.

30:19.510 --> 30:21.375
The lawyers are
being called.

30:21.420 --> 30:22.978
Looks like the
verdict's in.

30:29.890 --> 30:32.029
They're looking cocky.

30:40.300 --> 30:42.996
Try cases with husband
and wife defendants.

30:43.040 --> 30:44.007
We did.

30:44.040 --> 30:46.531
There are only eight
in the last five years.

30:49.640 --> 30:52.245
You're right, it was a mistake
to get my hopes up.

30:52.280 --> 30:53.542
We'll make this work.

31:03.490 --> 31:06.926
The cases where Judge Ellerbee
recused himself, look at them.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.188
What?

31:08.230 --> 31:09.458
Yes, we've only
looked at cases

31:09.500 --> 31:11.024
that Judge Ellerbee
presided over.

31:11.070 --> 31:12.492
Look at the ones
he didn't preside over.

31:12.530 --> 31:14.236
The ones he recused
himself from?

31:14.270 --> 31:16.238
Yes. If there was
a bribe involved,

31:16.270 --> 31:17.965
somebody might have been
angry that he dropped out.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.102
BAILIFF:
All rise.

31:19.140 --> 31:21.370
C_ourt is_now
in session.
Get gomg.

31:21.410 --> 31:24.470
Honorable Suzanne Morris
preSIding.

31:24.510 --> 31:28.014
Thank you.
Please be seated.

31:28.050 --> 31:29.972
I understand we don't
have a verdict, Petie?

31:30.020 --> 31:32.147
We just have a question?

31:32.190 --> 31:33.953
Yes, Your Honor.

31:33.990 --> 31:38.484
The jury would like a portion
of Judge Ellerbee's decision

31:38.530 --> 31:39.952
in the civil case
read to them.

31:39.990 --> 31:41.992
Any objection?
No, Your Honor.

31:42.030 --> 31:43.054
Mr. Gardner?
We need time.

31:43.100 --> 31:46.228
We have a direction,
but we need time.
Mr. Gardner?

31:46.270 --> 31:47.623
Yes, Your Honor.

31:47.670 --> 31:50.559
Um, we would suggest
to the court

31:50.600 --> 31:53.160
that the whole transcript
in context is important

31:53.210 --> 31:54.472
as an understanding
of the case.

31:54.510 --> 31:56.068
You're kidding.
And, therefore,

31:56.110 --> 31:58.442
we would ask that the whole
transcript be read

31:58.480 --> 31:59.606
and not just a portion.

31:59.650 --> 32:01.345
Your Honor, it's 186 pages.

32:01.380 --> 32:03.541
WILL: In the service
of justice.

32:03.580 --> 32:07.482
We believe it's
the very foundation

32:07.520 --> 32:09.078
of our judicial system,

32:09.120 --> 32:12.055
as promulgated by
our Founding Fathers,

32:12.090 --> 32:14.650
that comprehensiveness

32:14.700 --> 32:16.554
be chosen over...

32:18.570 --> 32:20.265
...the opposite.

32:20.300 --> 32:23.235
Okay.

32:23.270 --> 32:26.262
In the name of
comprehensweness.

32:26.310 --> 32:28.403
How's your reading
voice, Petie?

32:28.440 --> 32:31.409
186 pages-- how long
will that take?

32:31.450 --> 32:34.374
Three hours maybe.
You have three hours.

32:34.420 --> 32:37.241
Okay.
Senka Park development suit.

32:37.280 --> 32:38.645
A husband and wife defendant.

32:38.690 --> 32:40.419
Lost a suit against the city.

32:40.450 --> 32:43.112
Judge Ellerbee recused
himself for personal reasons.

32:43.160 --> 32:45.082
He was visiting his
daughter in Arizona?

32:45.130 --> 32:47.325
The defendants were Mr. and
Mrs. Gothard of Lincoln Park.

32:47.360 --> 32:50.227
We need to get her DNA.
I'm on it.

32:50.260 --> 32:52.262
I have to run, Eli.

32:52.300 --> 32:53.665
You called me.

32:53.700 --> 32:55.258
Yeah, then catch up.

33:02.340 --> 33:05.639
I thought you'd be happy.
That you're bringing
your business here?

33:05.680 --> 33:08.319
Yes. It's a boost for the firm,
it's a boost for you.

33:08.350 --> 33:09.510
You'll be my boss, Eli.

33:09.550 --> 33:12.110
No, I won't.
That's not how it'll work.

33:12.150 --> 33:13.617
That is exactly
how it'll work.

33:13.650 --> 33:16.517
No, you'll be a
liaison, that's all.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.778
You are so transparent, Eli.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.627
This is about
Peter's campaign.

33:20.660 --> 33:21.752
(whispering):
What are you talking about?

33:21.800 --> 33:23.051
He's going to run

33:23.100 --> 33:25.318
for Senate, or Governor,
or something.

33:25.370 --> 33:28.533
You don't just run for State's
Attorney; it's a stepping stone.

33:28.570 --> 33:29.537
Okay, I am not
admitting anything,

33:29.570 --> 33:32.038
but even if that were
true, this has nothing

33:32.070 --> 33:33.059
to do with that.

33:35.240 --> 33:36.400
I've got to bring my
business somewhere,

33:36.440 --> 33:38.078
and this place has
been good to me.

33:38.110 --> 33:39.543
A profile
from two years ago.

33:39.580 --> 33:41.719
Mrs. Gothard was at a fertility
clinic-- can you get DNA

33:41.750 --> 33:43.240
from a genetic test?

33:43.280 --> 33:45.384
Yeah.

33:47.720 --> 33:49.688
I'm not doing this, Eli.

33:49.720 --> 33:52.553
You need to bring your
business somewhere else.

33:54.100 --> 33:55.089
No.

33:59.870 --> 34:02.464
Alicia, I've deferred
to you in many things,

34:02.500 --> 34:03.637
but this is_ a
busmess deCI5ion.

34:03.670 --> 34:06.707
I am bringing my
consulting business here

34:06.740 --> 34:08.230
because I think
it's a good fit,

34:08.280 --> 34:09.679
and you are going
to be the liaison

34:10.710 --> 34:13.304
Now, you can find any
hidden agendas you want,

34:13.350 --> 34:16.615
but I'm not changing
my business plan.

34:23.420 --> 34:25.251
Hey, what's up?

34:25.290 --> 34:27.383
Why aren't you
returning my calls?

34:27.430 --> 34:29.489
Oh... I've been busy.

34:30.900 --> 34:33.391
(laughs)

34:33.430 --> 34:37.730
Okay. All is forgiven.

34:37.770 --> 34:38.862
What's going on?

34:38.910 --> 34:41.435
Yeah... I have
something for you.

34:41.480 --> 34:44.745
Okay.

34:44.780 --> 34:48.272
We found the DNA that matched
the blood on the glove.

34:48.320 --> 34:51.414
Mrs. Angela Gothard.

34:51.450 --> 34:54.419
She bribed Judge Ellerbee in
the Senka Park development suit.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.257
He recused himself.
She lost.

34:56.290 --> 34:57.757
A $33 million settlement.

35:01.930 --> 35:03.397
We have a jury deliberating.

35:03.430 --> 35:04.727
Yeah. On a botched case.

35:04.770 --> 35:06.761
That's a matter of opinion.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.735
Well, I think you'll find if
you read this, it's not.

35:11.810 --> 35:14.631
Talk to Alicia?

35:14.680 --> 35:16.830
Told her you
slept with Peter?

35:16.880 --> 35:19.576
Uh, you should read
the file, Cary.

35:19.610 --> 35:22.738
So you're freezing me out
because you talked to Alicia?

35:22.780 --> 35:24.145
I'm not freezing you out.

35:24.190 --> 35:26.750
Uh-huh.

35:26.790 --> 35:29.258
This is the usual
warm and fuzzy Kalinda.

35:31.490 --> 35:33.458
Read it, Cary.

35:33.490 --> 35:35.754
It's the right thing to do.

35:37.830 --> 35:38.922
BAILIFF:
All rise.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.790
Court is now in session.

35:40.830 --> 35:42.934
Honorable Suzanne Morris
preSIding.

35:42.970 --> 35:45.165
MORRIS:
Thank you. Please be seated.

35:46.510 --> 35:49.673
New evidence in the
form of DNA testing

35:49.710 --> 35:53.942
has surfaced in the _
Judge Ellerbee murder trial.

35:53.980 --> 35:57.939
This evidence has led me
to declare a mistrial.

35:57.980 --> 36:00.540
Yes!

36:00.590 --> 36:02.217
I told you--
I told you!

36:05.990 --> 36:08.823
MORRIS:
And I would urge the
new State's Attorney

36:08.860 --> 36:10.396
to reconsider prosecuting.

36:10.430 --> 36:12.227
Come here!

36:28.010 --> 36:29.216
It's nice.

36:39.930 --> 36:41.955
(laughing, talking happily)

37:06.020 --> 37:07.317
God, I hate tequila.

37:07.350 --> 37:08.817
Oh, it's so good!

37:08.860 --> 37:10.987
It's always the good
girls, isn't it?

37:11.020 --> 37:13.659
They're the ones with
the deep dark secrets.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.453
Yeah, well... because
we're catching up.

37:15.500 --> 37:18.321
Two more, please.

37:18.370 --> 37:21.339
BARTENDER:
Anytime.

37:21.370 --> 37:23.838
You and the women.

37:23.870 --> 37:27.328
What?
You and
the women.

37:27.370 --> 37:32.342
Chicago's 16th most
eligible bachelor.

37:32.380 --> 37:37.511
Yeah, the women like me until
they discover the real me.

37:37.550 --> 37:39.017
Which is...?

37:39.050 --> 37:40.347
You don't want to know.

37:40.390 --> 37:41.357
Oh, come on.

37:41.390 --> 37:43.358
I'm constantly
spilling it.

37:43.390 --> 37:45.426
What's the real you?

37:49.060 --> 37:50.948
Uncontrollable
bladder syndrome.

37:58.410 --> 38:01.538
God...

38:01.580 --> 38:03.571
you have a good laugh.

38:06.450 --> 38:07.747
And Tammy?

38:07.780 --> 38:09.577
What about Tammy?

38:09.620 --> 38:12.384
How's Tammy?

38:12.420 --> 38:14.047
My girlfriend?

38:14.090 --> 38:17.719
I think she's in London.

38:17.760 --> 38:22.720
She called me yesterday,
after the closing arguments.

38:22.760 --> 38:24.796
Her bags were packed.
I was supposed to rush over

38:24.830 --> 38:26.764
to see her, and
convince her to stay...

38:26.800 --> 38:30.896
And?

38:30.940 --> 38:33.431
I got the call
about the glove.

38:40.610 --> 38:42.874
We've always had bad
timing, haven't we?

38:42.920 --> 38:44.911
We have.

38:49.120 --> 38:52.123
What if we were to
suddenly have good timing,

38:52.160 --> 38:55.357
just for... an hour?

38:58.470 --> 38:59.994
What would that look like?

39:05.470 --> 39:10.476
I think that would look
like an exceptional moment.

39:28.160 --> 39:30.697
Ma'am.

39:37.040 --> 39:39.031
Ma'am.

39:40.840 --> 39:42.478
Hi.

39:42.510 --> 39:44.137
Hi. We need a room
for the night.

39:44.180 --> 39:46.068
Sorry, sir, we're
completely booked.

39:50.450 --> 39:51.587
There's no rooms?

39:51.620 --> 39:53.440
Yes, sir, I'm sorry.

39:53.490 --> 39:55.583
How is that possible?

39:55.620 --> 39:57.087
Well, we have the Burn
Association Convention in town.

39:59.130 --> 40:01.849
There's nothing?

40:01.900 --> 40:04.824
Well, the Presidential suite.

40:04.870 --> 40:06.428
But that's $7,800 a night.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.500
And the name of your
personal butler is Jerome.

40:17.540 --> 40:18.848
Thanks.

40:18.880 --> 40:20.404
Have a good night.

40:27.250 --> 40:28.683
(punching buttons)

40:28.720 --> 40:30.688
No.

40:32.190 --> 40:33.919
Come on.

40:41.870 --> 40:42.894
(elevator bell dings)

40:48.840 --> 40:49.829
(elevator bell dings)

40:55.720 --> 40:56.744
(elevator bell dings)

40:56.780 --> 40:58.782
* In any other world...

41:02.590 --> 41:04.478
Will.

41:04.530 --> 41:07.522
* You could tell
the difference *

41:10.260 --> 41:14.560
* And let it all unfurl

41:14.600 --> 41:18.229
Maybe...

41:18.270 --> 41:21.239
* Into broken remnants

41:25.180 --> 41:32.245
* Smile like you mean it

41:32.290 --> 41:35.612
* And let yourself let go

41:37.620 --> 41:40.919
* 'Cause it's all in the hands

41:40.960 --> 41:44.054
* Of a bitter, bitter man

41:44.100 --> 41:46.261
* Say good-bye

41:46.300 --> 41:50.930
* To the world
you thought you lived in *

41:50.970 --> 41:53.609
* To the world you thought
you lived in *

41:53.640 --> 41:55.528
(bell dings)

41:59.010 --> 42:00.500
(bell dings)

42:04.220 --> 42:05.744
(bell dings)

42:09.090 --> 42:12.548
* I tried to live alone

42:16.200 --> 42:20.227
* But lonely is
so lonely, alone *

42:21.330 --> 42:24.299
Aw, come on.

42:24.340 --> 42:26.638
Please God, one hour.

42:26.670 --> 42:27.967
That's all we want.

42:28.010 --> 42:29.204
It's okay.

42:29.240 --> 42:31.003
I'll go downstairs
and get a new key.

42:31.040 --> 42:33.042
30 seconds.

42:34.380 --> 42:36.211
What?

42:36.250 --> 42:38.241
* Take a bow,
play the part *

42:38.280 --> 42:41.716
* Of a lonely, lonely heart

42:41.760 --> 42:44.149
* Say good-bye

42:44.190 --> 42:47.580
* To the world you
thought you lived in *

42:47.630 --> 42:50.053
* To the world you thought
you lived in *

42:50.100 --> 42:51.727
* Say good-bye

42:51.770 --> 42:54.739
* To the world
you thought you lived in *

42:54.770 --> 42:56.658
* Say good-bye

42:56.700 --> 42:58.668
* To the world you
thought you lived in. *
