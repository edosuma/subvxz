WEBVTT

00:45.420 --> 00:47.297
<i>...just in time for Christmas.</i>

00:47.380 --> 00:49.257
<i>I can't think of a better gesture.</i>

00:49.340 --> 00:53.261
<i>Celebrating birthdays today,
Jennifer Beals is 26...</i>

00:58.725 --> 01:00.769
Do you hear that music, Mr. Zipper?

02:17.262 --> 02:19.180
Yeah, no, I said
I was gonna take care of it.

02:19.264 --> 02:20.974
Come on, sweetie, you gotta eat, please.

02:21.057 --> 02:22.767
Yes, I will be right in.

02:23.476 --> 02:25.103
Come on, sweetie, please?

02:25.186 --> 02:27.021
-Just take one bite.

02:28.606 --> 02:30.525
-Come on, Mommy's got to get to work.

02:32.277 --> 02:33.611
Why did that work when you did it?

02:33.695 --> 02:35.947
-You didn't do it right.
-Yeah. You didn't do it right.

02:37.657 --> 02:41.619
Look, and I know this isn't our old house,
but give it a chance.

02:41.703 --> 02:44.205
I liked growing up here...
most of the time.

02:46.916 --> 02:49.419
Oh, God, that stupid floorboard.

02:49.502 --> 02:50.753
We'll get it fixed.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.046
They add character.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.340
Where did you come from, hmm?

02:54.883 --> 02:57.594
How did I get this glass-half-full girl?

02:57.677 --> 02:59.387
Uh, don't you remember?

02:59.470 --> 03:01.639
You ordered me
from the glass-half-full catalog.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.267
Oh, hey.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.311
Last day of summer break.
You got any big plans?

03:06.436 --> 03:07.812
Oh, yeah. Huge.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.981
I was gonna take some boxes,
break them down.

03:10.064 --> 03:11.441
Maybe take them to the recycling bin.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.820
Look, I know it's been hard
ever since your dad and I...

03:18.072 --> 03:19.073
...you know.

03:19.699 --> 03:22.076
Mom, you can say "divorce".

03:22.827 --> 03:24.787
I won't break into a million pieces.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.583
I just want you to know I appreciate it.

03:29.250 --> 03:32.503
-How big a help you've been.
-Mom, I'm fine.

03:33.504 --> 03:34.672
Seriously.

04:01.574 --> 04:02.742
Do you mind?

04:03.368 --> 04:05.578
You're blocking my light.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.498
-Oh, sorry, I, I didn't...
-I'm kidding.

04:09.540 --> 04:12.627
How could you possibly be blocking
my light from all the way over there?

04:13.336 --> 04:15.088
Are you seriously that uptight?

04:15.171 --> 04:17.298
-Um, I...
-That was rhetorical.

04:20.718 --> 04:21.636
Graham.

04:24.722 --> 04:25.974
And you are?

04:26.099 --> 04:27.433
Oh, Olivia.

04:27.517 --> 04:28.726
Olivia.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.230
I'm coming over.

04:39.904 --> 04:41.447
That looks tedious.

04:41.531 --> 04:42.907
You... you could help me, you know.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.200
Yah, I know.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.872
Oh, good, my new neighbor's
a cheerleader. Yay.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.417
-Hey! What's that supposed to mean?
-No, nothing.

04:52.500 --> 04:55.003
No, I'm sure you're
a fascinating conversationalist.

04:55.086 --> 04:58.131
I'll have you know,
not all cheerleaders are ditzes.

04:58.214 --> 04:59.716
I was captain of the debate team.

05:00.466 --> 05:01.342
Uh-huh.

05:04.387 --> 05:07.473
The outside of this house
always creeped me out.

05:07.557 --> 05:08.683
I have to say,

05:08.766 --> 05:10.977
the inside does not disappoint.

05:11.060 --> 05:15.773
It has that "something bad happened here
a long time ago" vibe.

05:16.607 --> 05:18.151
I'm into it.

05:18.234 --> 05:20.611
-I'm a big fan of the macabre.

05:20.695 --> 05:22.530
Then you'd love it here.

05:22.613 --> 05:24.907
I've been seeing and hearing weird things
since we moved in.

05:26.367 --> 05:27.827
I need examples.

05:28.411 --> 05:31.748
Shadows, like,
flickering lights, weird music.

05:31.831 --> 05:34.125
That stuff.

05:34.208 --> 05:36.294
But, I mean, that's just
what old houses do, right?

05:38.254 --> 05:40.465
Like, ghosts aren't real, right?

05:42.300 --> 05:44.218
They're not "not real".

05:47.847 --> 05:48.973
Could be nothing.

05:50.058 --> 05:53.019
Or... could be a poltergeist.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.349
GRAHAM <i>This is bad.</i>

07:55.933 --> 07:58.686
I mean, this is really bad, Olivia.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.272
I mean, the mask is one thing,
but the suit...

08:01.355 --> 08:04.650
There's nothing more dangerous
than a maniac with taste.

08:10.656 --> 08:11.616
What's wrong?

08:12.658 --> 08:15.453
Uh, I mean, besides the seven-foot demon
in your kitchen.

08:16.078 --> 08:17.121
Nothing.

08:17.788 --> 08:21.292
Just... first day
at a new school, you know?

08:21.375 --> 08:22.752
Ah, don't worry.

08:23.252 --> 08:26.214
Not like your whole life's riding
on making a good first impression.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.221
Jade!

08:33.804 --> 08:36.891
This is Olivia. Olivia, meet Jade.

08:36.974 --> 08:40.895
Jade is one of our resident queen bees
and, uh, fellow cheerleader.

08:40.978 --> 08:42.230
So, uh...

08:44.273 --> 08:46.150
My work here is done. Bye!

08:48.152 --> 08:49.529
Ah. So, where are you from?

08:49.612 --> 08:51.489
Uh, Chicago. Basically.

08:51.572 --> 08:52.949
I mean, like, right outside.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.242
But my mom's from here, so...

08:54.325 --> 08:55.368
Party time.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.787
-Hey, I'm Chloe.
-Oh, I'm Olivia.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.580
Olivia is trying out for the squad.

08:59.664 --> 09:02.166
Please tell me you're a flyer.
We need another good flyer.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.126
-I'm a flyer.
-Amazing.

09:04.210 --> 09:08.506
Well, flyer, if you have Saturday plans,
cancel them and come to my party.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.550
Thrill n' Chill, baby!

09:11.676 --> 09:13.803
-Thrill n' chill?
-It's an amusement park.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.430
They have the most insane roller coaster.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.849
Wait, roller coaster?

09:18.933 --> 09:20.142
The Dragon's Tongue.

09:20.226 --> 09:22.103
It's, like, the oldest
roller coaster ever.

09:22.186 --> 09:24.772
My brother said, like, 50 people
get thrown off of it every year.

09:25.982 --> 09:30.403
Anyway, my mom got us priority passes,
so we can ride as many times as we want.

09:46.877 --> 09:47.962
Olivia.

09:49.630 --> 09:50.673
Olivia.

09:51.465 --> 09:52.383
Olivia.

09:52.466 --> 09:54.051
-Mm?

09:54.635 --> 09:55.845
Are you okay?

09:55.928 --> 09:56.929
What?

09:57.013 --> 10:00.808
Oh, yeah, I'm just not
the hugest fan of roller coasters.

10:00.891 --> 10:01.934
Uh, it's fine.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.102
It's no biggie.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.440
-It was nice meeting you.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.947
-Try "tall guy, strange music."

10:15.031 --> 10:16.991
-No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, no.

10:17.074 --> 10:19.243
-Tall guy, strange music, and a mask.
-Shh. Patience.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.537
Please, a little patience.

10:22.163 --> 10:26.125
A paranormal investigator
can take years to solve the case.

10:26.208 --> 10:28.502
Can't expect me to solve this
in one study hall.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.382
Oy vey.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.052
Speaking of being summoned
by evil forces...

10:38.846 --> 10:40.973
Sophomore love triangle
just went critical,

10:41.057 --> 10:43.434
so I'm being called in to mediate.

10:43.517 --> 10:45.478
Honestly, you solve one crisis,

10:45.561 --> 10:48.147
and suddenly,
you're everyone's personal therapist.

10:48.856 --> 10:50.524
Word of advice, Olivia.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.985
Never be great at anything.

10:53.736 --> 10:54.820
It's exhausting.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.782
-Watch my stuff?
-Yeah.

12:50.978 --> 12:52.271
No. No...

12:52.354 --> 12:53.731
Come on, come on.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.232
Listen. Okay, okay.

12:56.358 --> 12:57.568
No, no. Please.

12:57.651 --> 12:59.069
No!

13:00.780 --> 13:01.947
-Come on.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.616
Please, please, please, please, please.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.117
No!

13:34.772 --> 13:35.981
Olivia.

13:37.900 --> 13:38.901
Olivia.

13:39.568 --> 13:41.028
-Huh?
-Olivia, see this.

13:41.111 --> 13:42.488
-Look how insane...
-<i>Eight percent of riders</i>

13:42.571 --> 13:43.614
-...that is.
-<i>lose their lunch,</i>

13:43.697 --> 13:48.452
<i>but one hundred percent lose their minds
from our insane loops,</i>

13:48.536 --> 13:53.999
<i>borderline dangerous drops,
and one-of-a-kind flaming Spiral of Death.</i>

13:54.083 --> 13:56.752
<i>So hurry, before we get
our permits revoked.</i>

13:56.836 --> 13:58.921
<i>Come ride the Dragon.</i>

14:15.896 --> 14:17.523
All right, second years, you're up.

14:17.606 --> 14:19.483
Everybody else, watch and learn.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.235
Coach, we're short a flyer.

14:22.528 --> 14:23.612
What about Olivia?

14:23.696 --> 14:25.030
Yeah, Olivia's a flyer.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.032
-Yeah, but I--
-MRS.All right.

14:27.658 --> 14:28.617
On the mat.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.369
I don't know the routine.

14:30.452 --> 14:32.371
You'll be fine, it's easy.
One, two, three, step.

14:32.454 --> 14:34.373
One, two, three, up, heel stretch,
liberty, heel stretch, basket.

14:34.456 --> 14:35.958
-Got it?
-MRS.Ready, and...

14:36.041 --> 14:39.169
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

14:56.770 --> 14:57.855
Here comes the step up.

15:13.787 --> 15:16.332
Oh, my God. Olivia, are you okay?

15:20.711 --> 15:25.215
Okay, so it haunts you at home,
it haunts you at school.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.676
Sometimes you hear music,
sometimes you don't.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.012
-Yeah.
-It chases you, it doesn't chase you.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.890
Whatever this thing is,
it's not very consistent.

15:32.973 --> 15:34.850
But why is it haunting me?

15:35.392 --> 15:39.688
I don't know.
Maybe it's an enemy from a past life?

15:41.148 --> 15:45.486
No? Maybe... maybe
your grandparents built your house

15:45.569 --> 15:47.446
on top of a haunted orphanage.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.950
Or maybe it is one of your grandparents,

15:51.033 --> 15:54.828
and they came back from the dead
to steal your life force.

15:57.915 --> 16:01.752
Whatever the reason is, I give you about
a 40 percent chance of seeing graduation.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.589
Thanks, Graham.
Makes me feel so much better.

16:06.507 --> 16:09.760
Hey, look on the bright side, right?
At least you'd be going out on top.

16:09.843 --> 16:13.097
First day of school and you get an invite
to Chloe's birthday party?

16:13.180 --> 16:15.349
You won the popularity Powerball.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.935
Yeah, I don't think I'm going.

16:19.478 --> 16:20.521
Excuse me?

16:22.022 --> 16:23.983
Did I just hear you say
you were gonna turn down

16:24.066 --> 16:25.985
an invite from Chloe Gallo?

16:26.068 --> 16:28.779
The Dragon roller coaster thing
they wanna ride?

16:28.862 --> 16:30.698
It looks terrifying.

16:31.323 --> 16:35.661
Kid, I guarantee you
that it will be less scary

16:35.744 --> 16:40.165
than spending the next four years
of your life in social Siberia.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.210
Do yourself a favor, Olivia.

16:44.461 --> 16:45.379
Ride the Dragon.

16:48.882 --> 16:52.970
<i>Come ride the only roller coaster
condemned by the United Nations.</i>

16:53.053 --> 16:54.430
<i>No height restrictions,</i>

16:54.513 --> 16:56.390
-<i>no age restrictions.</i>

16:56.473 --> 16:59.143
-<i>We don't even care if...</i>
-I just got called back to the office.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.311
I know, I know.

17:01.395 --> 17:02.563
Movie night.

17:02.980 --> 17:04.231
Worst mom ever.

17:04.314 --> 17:06.400
-Can't you just work from home?
-I wish.

17:06.483 --> 17:08.610
But there's this
big presentation tomorrow.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.154
Everyone is melting down.

17:10.237 --> 17:12.448
And, of course, I am the only one
who can deal with it.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.615
Please don't leave.

17:14.908 --> 17:17.369
Livvy, is something wrong?

17:17.453 --> 17:20.330
No, no, no, it's nothing. It's fine. I...

17:20.706 --> 17:23.292
I think I was just really looking forward
to movie night, so...

17:23.375 --> 17:25.002
-Oh.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.920
That must be Mrs. Lipton.

17:27.004 --> 17:28.547
Seriously?

17:28.630 --> 17:30.591
Mom, I'm 14.

17:30.674 --> 17:32.051
I don't need a babysitter,

17:32.134 --> 17:34.428
especially not Mrs. Lipton.

17:34.511 --> 17:36.263
What's wrong with Mrs. Lipton?

17:38.724 --> 17:40.059
Butterscotch?

17:40.184 --> 17:42.728
My number's on the fridge.
Help yourself to anything.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.229
-And thanks again.

17:44.313 --> 17:47.107
Oh, it's no bother at all.

17:47.191 --> 17:50.736
You know, I remember babysitting you
when you were a little girl.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.239
Where on Earth are my keys?

17:54.323 --> 17:56.450
-They're upstairs on your dresser.
-Oh.

18:03.707 --> 18:05.000
So...

18:06.293 --> 18:07.753
You knew my mom when she was little?

18:08.629 --> 18:09.797
Hmm?

18:10.005 --> 18:12.049
So you knew my mom when she was little?

18:12.132 --> 18:17.054
Oh, yes. Nervous little thing,
used to insist this house was haunted.

18:18.847 --> 18:19.932
Haunted?

18:20.015 --> 18:21.892
MRS.
Never could get her to go to bed.

18:22.518 --> 18:25.938
"There's a monster in my closet,
there's a monster outside my window."

18:26.730 --> 18:28.857
Children and their imaginations.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.360
Did she ever say
what the monster looked like?

18:32.069 --> 18:34.071
Looked like? Hmm.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.490
No, I don't recall her saying.

18:37.574 --> 18:41.245
Oh, but I do remember her saying
she would hear music.

18:41.328 --> 18:45.833
That's right. She would hear music
whenever it was nearby.

18:49.211 --> 18:50.879
MRS.Oh, goodness, dear.

18:50.963 --> 18:54.800
You're just as wound up as she was.

18:55.509 --> 18:57.344
God, where is it?

18:58.512 --> 19:00.055
-I don't see...

19:01.807 --> 19:04.184
My life-saver.

19:07.104 --> 19:08.147
Livvy?

19:08.897 --> 19:10.315
You saw it too.

19:12.192 --> 19:13.277
The monster.

19:14.778 --> 19:16.822
You'd hear the music before it came.

19:18.282 --> 19:20.576
You saw it when you were my age,
didn't you?

19:25.080 --> 19:26.707
The man in the mask.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.793
What is it?

19:32.004 --> 19:33.130
Come here, honey.

19:39.970 --> 19:42.014
I used to call it my nervous monster

19:42.097 --> 19:44.766
because it only showed up
when I was worried about something.

19:47.227 --> 19:48.604
I would hear the music.

19:52.983 --> 19:55.068
<i>And then he would appear.</i>

20:02.075 --> 20:04.703
So, are we, like... cursed?

20:04.786 --> 20:05.996
No.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.957
No. We're not cursed.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.168
We're just different.

20:13.337 --> 20:16.590
Your grandma used to call it my Squeamber

20:17.090 --> 20:20.844
because it showed up
when I was squeamish or somber.

20:21.470 --> 20:24.139
That's a really dumb name.

20:25.682 --> 20:27.601
I think that was the point.

20:27.684 --> 20:30.812
She thought that if it sounded silly,
it would be less scary.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.022
And she was right.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.360
When does it stop showing up?

20:38.987 --> 20:42.032
Honey, they never stop.

20:43.784 --> 20:48.330
I still see it from time to time,
but we have an understanding.

20:49.748 --> 20:53.210
It's almost like... we're old friends.

20:56.046 --> 20:58.090
Livvy, why didn't you tell me?

20:59.216 --> 21:00.634
I didn't wanna worry you.

21:00.717 --> 21:04.596
I'm your mother,
you're allowed to worry me.

21:05.097 --> 21:09.810
You're also allowed to
have bad days and be upset.

21:12.646 --> 21:13.730
You know what?

21:14.439 --> 21:16.483
I'm gonna tell work I can't make it.

21:16.566 --> 21:17.526
No.

21:19.444 --> 21:22.990
If you can face yours, I can face mine.

21:24.199 --> 21:26.827
-I'll be back as soon as I can.

21:28.578 --> 21:29.538
I love you.

22:47.866 --> 22:48.825
Livvy!

23:02.089 --> 23:03.298
Olivia!

23:47.884 --> 23:48.802
No.

23:50.303 --> 23:51.596
No.

23:52.889 --> 23:53.765
No.

23:53.932 --> 23:54.891
No!

23:54.975 --> 23:56.101
Hey. Stop!

23:58.019 --> 23:58.937
Stop!

24:00.439 --> 24:01.898
I said stop!

24:13.368 --> 24:14.369
Back off.

24:22.752 --> 24:23.879
Turn around.

24:27.549 --> 24:28.717
Keep turning.

24:31.678 --> 24:32.721
Stop.

25:05.212 --> 25:07.380
<i>Olivia, Jade's here!</i>

25:11.676 --> 25:12.969
Olivia!

25:13.053 --> 25:15.639
You ready to lick the Dragon's Tongue?

25:15.722 --> 25:17.807
Uh, so ready.

25:19.226 --> 25:20.769
Bye, Mom. Bye, Aaron.

25:21.436 --> 25:23.021
The Dragon's Tongue?

25:23.104 --> 25:24.356
Yeah, I'll be fine.

25:25.774 --> 25:27.025
Have a great time.

25:27.108 --> 25:28.193
I will.

25:32.072 --> 25:33.281
Wear your seat belt.

25:50.131 --> 25:51.716
Sorry, that seat's taken.

25:52.676 --> 25:54.219
Who are you talking to?

25:57.180 --> 25:58.056
Friend.

26:04.312 --> 26:05.480
I didn't know you were invited.

26:05.981 --> 26:07.023
I wasn't.
