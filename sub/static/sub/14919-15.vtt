WEBVTT

00:07.148 --> 00:07.960
Are you busy?

00:07.961 --> 00:09.137
Yeah. No.

00:09.138 --> 00:11.657
I mean, I have, uh, time. Come... come in.

00:11.658 --> 00:13.693
- Why aren't you at school?
- Swim meet,

00:13.693 --> 00:16.131
and my car pool's waiting for
me, and I'm really late.

00:16.132 --> 00:17.881
But I have a huge favor to ask you.

00:17.975 --> 00:20.314
Uh, I have this project for health class.

00:20.528 --> 00:22.833
- This is my pretend baby.
- Yeah, I've heard about this.

00:22.834 --> 00:25.374
You lug a 5-pound sack of flour
around like it's a baby,

00:25.375 --> 00:28.033
and after a while, it annoys you so much,

00:28.034 --> 00:30.634
you never, ever want to get
knocked up before marriage.

00:30.635 --> 00:33.632
I think they're actually hoping
I'll never, ever have sex. Right.

00:33.781 --> 00:35.704
So is it a boy or a girl? Boy.

00:35.772 --> 00:39.024
How can you tell?
Uh, we all picked the genders out of a hat.

00:39.025 --> 00:42.615
- Well, then we should give him a name.
- Joaquin Winter Whedon.

00:43.036 --> 00:45.686
Uh, I even made a birth certificate
for him and everything.

00:46.535 --> 00:48.495
Hello, Joaquin. That's a nice name.

00:48.496 --> 00:51.104
- He's from Paraguay.
- How did that happen?

00:51.105 --> 00:54.106
- I was in the pretend peace corps.
- Romantic.

00:54.246 --> 00:57.192
Yeah, but now I'm a single mom,
and it's getting really hard.

00:57.429 --> 01:00.295
- You have to get really detailed
about this, huh? - Yeah.

01:01.530 --> 01:02.544
I have to go.

01:02.545 --> 01:06.530
Um, mom said that maybe you could
drive Joaquin over to her office.

01:06.531 --> 01:07.770
She promised to babysit,

01:07.771 --> 01:09.566
and then forgot to take him
with her this morning.

01:09.754 --> 01:11.662
And now I'm late, and I
don't have child care.

01:12.659 --> 01:13.474
What do I do?

01:13.475 --> 01:15.194
Just write in this little baby journal

01:15.195 --> 01:17.701
when you change him and
pretend feed him and stuff.

01:18.323 --> 01:21.040
And it's really important to
keep him on a schedule, okay?

01:21.041 --> 01:22.358
It'll be great practice

01:22.365 --> 01:24.300
for when I have to look after Olivia 24/7.

01:24.550 --> 01:27.574
Yeah. Um, I have to go.
Thank you so much, Uncle Kevin.

01:29.380 --> 01:31.219
That's great Uncle Kevin to you.

01:38.940 --> 01:40.263
Did the alarm go off?

01:40.513 --> 01:43.667
No, no. I just want to spend
a few minutes with you

01:43.672 --> 01:44.894
before you go to work.

01:47.723 --> 01:50.364
Hopefully, I can do better
than a few minutes.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:59.683 --> 02:02.996
- No. No.
- Gosh. I thought I set it on buzzer.

02:06.107 --> 02:08.598
Before the break, we had a woman caller

02:08.600 --> 02:12.667
whose fantasy is to run in a nude marathon.

02:12.811 --> 02:15.131
Um, Dr. Milton, you very much believe

02:15.132 --> 02:17.548
that people should act on their fantasies.

02:18.118 --> 02:20.733
You see, that's what's so heartbreaking

02:20.734 --> 02:22.189
about the caller's dilemma.

02:22.358 --> 02:24.442
One can only hope for her sake

02:24.443 --> 02:26.554
that the world will
become more open-minded.

02:26.555 --> 02:28.595
Okay, let's take another call.

02:28.596 --> 02:31.179
We have Joe from Sacramento.

02:31.812 --> 02:32.535
Good morning, Joe.

02:32.536 --> 02:35.334
- Hi, Joe. - I've been thinking about
looking up an old girlfriend.

02:35.335 --> 02:38.050
Ah. Now that is a perfect example

02:38.051 --> 02:40.365
of fantasy versus reality. Perfect, Joe.

02:40.366 --> 02:43.868
Could an old love from your past
still harbor feelings for you,

02:43.869 --> 02:46.983
or are you headed for one big letdown?

02:46.984 --> 02:48.015
Uh-oh, Joe.

02:48.413 --> 02:51.851
Abuela, did you miss me?

02:51.852 --> 02:54.017
Very cute. Now take it off.

02:54.018 --> 02:56.062
What, why? Look, I stuffed the little arms

02:56.063 --> 02:57.166
and the hoodie with tissue.

02:57.528 --> 03:00.595
Paige is way too invested
in that baby already.

03:00.596 --> 03:02.127
What's the point of having a
fake baby around the house

03:02.128 --> 03:05.079
if you can't dress it up?
What's the point of having a fake baby

03:05.080 --> 03:07.581
that doesn't poop, spit
up, or cry all night?

03:07.582 --> 03:09.806
If all these kids do is
carry them around...

03:09.807 --> 03:11.614
and dress them in their little hoodies,

03:11.615 --> 03:14.159
what kind of disincentive is that?

03:14.160 --> 03:17.232
And why do I have to babysit it?
Aren't you the grumpy grandma?

03:17.233 --> 03:19.818
I think you should cut Paige a break.
She worked really hard

03:19.819 --> 03:21.959
building that water treatment
plant in Paraguay.

03:23.042 --> 03:24.991
So I turned on mom's show
in the car on the way over.

03:24.991 --> 03:27.502
You would not believe the pervs calling in.

03:27.503 --> 03:29.984
Don't sneeze at my pervs.
They're very good for ratings.

03:36.956 --> 03:38.396
- Oh, my God. 
- What? ...

03:43.108 --> 03:43.867
What?

03:47.159 --> 03:49.098
Oh, God. Why is he calling her?

03:49.160 --> 03:51.178
He's not supposed to be calling her.

03:51.708 --> 03:54.144
Tell me that is not Brody...

03:54.144 --> 03:56.439
And please tell me you're
not the little birdie.

03:57.153 --> 03:59.029
I'd recognize his voice anywhere. Sarah...

03:59.176 --> 04:02.127
Oh, Kev. Perfect timing.
Rose made these. You'll eat 'em.

04:02.329 --> 04:04.044
Eat rose's cookie, Kevin.

04:04.045 --> 04:05.543
What, you think I'm gonna let this slide?

04:05.544 --> 04:06.950
Kevin... remember after her
little meltdown, she said

04:06.951 --> 04:09.110
she was gonna drop the
whole Brody issue? Yeah.

04:09.111 --> 04:11.876
She didn't. She tracked him down.
Whoa. You met him?

04:11.877 --> 04:14.073
Yes. Well, after my brothers blew me off,

04:14.074 --> 04:15.350
I had to go find him for myself.

04:15.833 --> 04:19.988
He's the manager of a semi-pro
baseball team in Modesto.

04:21.052 --> 04:23.099
We... we talked briefly. And?

04:23.100 --> 04:25.450
And he confirmed that he's not my dad.

04:26.503 --> 04:29.471
That's all. It was no big deal.
Well, it's a big deal now.

04:34.142 --> 04:34.683
No.

04:36.573 --> 04:37.572
That's him? Yeah.

04:37.573 --> 04:40.082
How was I supposed to know
he'd come sniffing around?

04:40.598 --> 04:43.227
Does mom know that's him? Maybe not.

04:47.553 --> 04:50.158
How did things end with your lady?

04:50.279 --> 04:53.852
Uh, not great.
She was dating me and another guy,

04:53.853 --> 04:56.986
and I kind of dropped
the ball, so to speak.

04:57.629 --> 04:59.166
Don't kid yourself. She knows.

04:59.544 --> 05:00.628
This is perfect.

05:00.629 --> 05:03.248
Mom's gonna get mad at you and rose again,

05:03.249 --> 05:06.193
and rose is gonna freak out,
she's gonna get mad at me,

05:06.194 --> 05:07.929
and then I'm gonna have to run around

05:07.930 --> 05:09.670
and try to smooth things over. Shh.

05:10.141 --> 05:11.782
I don't know what my job title is here,

05:11.783 --> 05:13.658
but it's starting to
feel a lot like referee.

05:13.659 --> 05:14.846
Wait. We can talk about this later.

05:14.847 --> 05:17.207
But right now, mom is going
off the air in five minutes,

05:17.208 --> 05:18.757
and we need to have a
plan, because I cannot

05:18.758 --> 05:21.060
get into this again with her.
I'm not sticking around for this.

05:21.061 --> 05:22.907
I can't deal with you two anymore.

05:24.704 --> 05:26.992
No way. Don't look at me.
I'm an innocent bystander here.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.783
Exactly. Mom's not gonna yell at you.

05:28.784 --> 05:31.409
Kevin, I really need you to stay
here and smooth things over.

05:31.410 --> 05:34.410
No way. Absolutely... Sarah. Sarah. Sarah!

05:34.531 --> 05:36.890
Look, no. You forgot Joaquin.

05:36.891 --> 05:39.880
I'm interested in hearing
Nora Walker's opinion, too.

05:39.881 --> 05:40.963
You've been pretty quiet.

05:41.540 --> 05:43.902
It's my opinion, Joe,

05:43.903 --> 05:45.553
that you're taking way
too much for granted.

05:45.554 --> 05:47.255
Sometimes these little birdies,

05:47.256 --> 05:49.442
they don't know what the
hell they're talking about.

05:49.443 --> 05:52.285
Never, ever barge in

05:52.286 --> 05:54.503
on a former girlfriend unannounced.

05:54.504 --> 05:56.364
You have to be respectful
of their feelings.

05:56.365 --> 05:58.021
Women don't like to be surprised.

05:58.443 --> 06:00.205
A handwritten letter's nice...

06:00.206 --> 06:02.488
a very nice gesture... wait a week or two,

06:02.489 --> 06:05.140
follow up with a phone call,
and don't leave Sacramento.

06:05.375 --> 06:07.297
Don't leave Sacramento

06:07.298 --> 06:08.875
unless you're absolutely positive

06:08.880 --> 06:11.340
she wants to see you again.

06:15.169 --> 06:17.187
Mom? No, it's me.

06:17.188 --> 06:19.121
Oh, thank God. What are you doing here?

06:19.189 --> 06:20.970
Someone forgot Joaquin.

06:21.248 --> 06:22.729
Thank you so much.

06:22.730 --> 06:24.440
You really are a crappy grandmother.

06:24.441 --> 06:26.675
No, you're being too nice.
I am a crappy daughter,

06:26.676 --> 06:28.244
a crappy sister, a crappy mother,

06:28.245 --> 06:29.985
and a crappy grandmother. Yep.

06:29.986 --> 06:32.114
I suggest you go on a global apology tour,

06:32.120 --> 06:34.523
starting with me. Why?
What did I do to you?

06:34.524 --> 06:37.392
You left me to clean up your mess with mom.
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

06:37.739 --> 06:39.010
- Do you forgive me? 
- No.

06:40.248 --> 06:42.204
Whoever it is, I'm sorry.

06:42.205 --> 06:45.579
Well, save it for mom.
She just called me, shrieking that

06:45.580 --> 06:47.917
you were talking trash about
her to that Brody guy.

06:48.017 --> 06:49.418
Sarah, I thought you were letting that go.

06:49.419 --> 06:50.767
I am. I am letting it go.

06:50.768 --> 06:52.212
Okay? Let's just drop it right now.

06:52.213 --> 06:54.336
Well, mom's not dropping it.
She's really upset.

06:54.337 --> 06:56.814
She's overreact... Listen, okay.
I will call her.

06:56.815 --> 06:59.017
I will calm her down, okay? Hi, mom.

06:59.290 --> 07:00.164
Justin, I gotta go.

07:00.165 --> 07:02.391
Sarah... Did you find her?

07:02.392 --> 07:03.550
No, I didn't find her.

07:03.551 --> 07:05.589
Tommy's not answering his phone either.

07:05.590 --> 07:06.476
Why did he run off like that?

07:06.477 --> 07:09.835
Well, Tommy isn't exactly
ecstatic about things.

07:09.836 --> 07:11.088
What things? Job things.

07:11.307 --> 07:13.646
You know, Sarah is being
way too hard on him.

07:13.647 --> 07:15.294
- That's another thing I want
to talk to her about. - No!

07:15.295 --> 07:17.678
Tell her that I'm looking
for her, all right?

07:17.742 --> 07:20.521
Oh, for God sakes!

07:20.522 --> 07:23.584
What's all that honking?
What's all that honking?

07:23.805 --> 07:25.652
Some horse's patoot

07:25.653 --> 07:28.124
and his hideous, gas-guzzling motor home

07:28.125 --> 07:31.402
is practically blocking my driveway.

07:31.713 --> 07:33.789
Jeez. What is wrong with people?

07:33.790 --> 07:35.548
What'd she say?
I think she's having road rage.

07:35.549 --> 07:37.561
That anyone would just do this...

07:37.562 --> 07:39.265
You're not allowed to in this area. Aah!

07:39.315 --> 07:40.971
Mom, is everything all right?

07:40.972 --> 07:43.088
Oh, God. There's a big dog running loose.

07:44.881 --> 07:45.907
Jeez.

07:47.079 --> 07:48.899
For God sakes.

07:50.307 --> 07:51.426
Hello!

07:52.180 --> 07:53.567
Hello! You know what?

07:53.568 --> 07:55.991
You're gonna have to move this monstrosity.

07:55.992 --> 07:57.588
Mom, what is it? Oh, my God.

07:57.589 --> 07:59.080
What? It's him.

07:59.103 --> 08:00.562
Who? He's here.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.267
- Who? 
- He's been here all along.

08:02.268 --> 08:02.980
Brody?

08:03.360 --> 08:05.466
What? You are so dead.

08:08.262 --> 08:09.078
Hey, slugger.

08:21.843 --> 08:23.956
You just show up out of the blue?

08:24.092 --> 08:25.168
I would've thought

08:25.169 --> 08:27.899
you might have grown out
of this behavior by now.

08:27.900 --> 08:29.821
Come on. It's not like I
climbed your downspout

08:29.822 --> 08:30.794
in the middle of the night

08:30.795 --> 08:33.330
and accidentally knocked
on your mother's window.

08:36.682 --> 08:39.097
Oh, she still thinks we
were hit by a cat burglar.

08:39.099 --> 08:40.726
To this day... nice.

08:40.727 --> 08:42.017
She sleeps with her pathetic jewelry...

08:42.018 --> 08:43.922
You know what? That's not the point.

08:43.923 --> 08:45.603
And this wasn't out of the blue, Nora.

08:46.611 --> 08:47.719
I was encouraged.

08:48.628 --> 08:50.922
I have no idea what Sarah said to you,

08:50.923 --> 08:52.897
but you have completely
the wrong impression.

08:52.898 --> 08:57.483
I don't need o-or want my flames fanned.

08:57.560 --> 08:59.167
So you haven't been talking about me?

08:59.168 --> 09:01.528
God, no. No.

09:01.529 --> 09:04.637
Your name came up in conversation once.

09:04.638 --> 09:05.254
That's all.

09:05.255 --> 09:06.971
It must have been a hell of a conversation.

09:07.907 --> 09:09.997
She wanted to know if I was her father.

09:10.474 --> 09:11.868
Where'd she get that idea?

09:13.051 --> 09:15.292
From the Internet.
She got it from the inter-Internet,

09:15.293 --> 09:17.243
and there... there was that whole mix up

09:17.244 --> 09:19.097
with her birth certificate and everything.

09:19.098 --> 09:22.891
And then, well, we've had a few
paternity issues in this family,

09:22.892 --> 09:25.713
so naturally, she just jumped
to the wrong conclusion.

09:25.816 --> 09:27.036
I get what you mean.

09:27.290 --> 09:29.926
I always had a hunch William
was the type to cheat.

09:33.353 --> 09:35.123
No. God, no.

09:35.490 --> 09:39.393
God, no. William was a
wonderful, wonderful man.

09:39.394 --> 09:40.418
God rest his soul.

09:40.419 --> 09:44.872
We had 40 years of a spectacular marriage

09:44.873 --> 09:46.555
without a single issue.

09:46.556 --> 09:48.132
Congratulations. That's a good run.

09:48.133 --> 09:51.179
I couldn't put together ten
years between two wives.

09:51.180 --> 09:54.937
Because your priority was never
marriage and children, was it?

09:54.938 --> 09:55.922
Well, that didn't take long.

09:56.927 --> 10:00.103
All these years, and you're
still holding that against me.

10:01.988 --> 10:03.943
What exactly are you talking about?

10:04.058 --> 10:06.509
Baseball. I'm talking about baseball.

10:07.073 --> 10:09.478
Look, don't flatter yourself.

10:09.479 --> 10:13.115
I am thrilled... thrilled...
with how my life turned out.

10:13.116 --> 10:15.307
Good for you. I'm glad.

10:15.308 --> 10:18.213
And are you thrilled with
how your life turned out?

10:18.214 --> 10:19.392
It's had its ups and downs.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.415
But it's not over yet.

10:25.204 --> 10:27.110
Oh, there's Lily... finished
with her business.

10:27.886 --> 10:29.862
You don't mind if... if
she comes in, do you?

10:29.863 --> 10:32.577
Well, on-only for a second.
I've got an appointment here.

10:33.823 --> 10:35.969
You just fertilized your
garden, didn't you?

10:35.970 --> 10:38.268
And she loves manure. Don't you, girl?

10:43.688 --> 10:44.836
Let's take a look.

10:45.929 --> 10:47.428
Okay. You know where you are?

10:47.631 --> 10:49.228
Yep. You mind telling me?

10:49.391 --> 10:51.519
Vista Hermosa Park.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.074
Okay. Who's the president? What country?

10:53.770 --> 10:54.662
All right, let's not get fancy.

10:54.663 --> 10:55.719
I just want to make sure you don't

10:55.720 --> 10:58.101
have a concussion.
That's no fun. Name a country.

10:58.927 --> 11:01.573
Okay, um... Norway.

11:01.574 --> 11:03.378
Norway doesn't have a president.

11:03.379 --> 11:04.664
It's a constitutional monarchy.

11:06.719 --> 11:08.607
Oh, all right. Jarhead, huh?

11:09.831 --> 11:11.661
Semper fee fi fo fum.

11:11.662 --> 11:13.564
Iraq? Afghanistan.

11:13.863 --> 11:14.921
Oh, I did a tour in Kandahar.

11:14.922 --> 11:16.793
Gosh. We're practically brothers.

11:17.767 --> 11:20.834
Well, brother, looks like you're
gonna need some stitches.

11:21.544 --> 11:24.233
You got an awful lot of grit in there.
What did the guy hit you with?

11:25.408 --> 11:26.313
You see that tree?

11:27.352 --> 11:29.698
Yeah. That. He jumped me outta nowhere.

11:30.022 --> 11:30.915
How's the other guy look?

11:30.916 --> 11:32.362
You're missing a lot of
skin off your knuckles.

11:32.430 --> 11:33.959
Maybe I got a swing in or two.

11:34.178 --> 11:35.926
Looks like more than a swing.

11:35.927 --> 11:37.844
People sneak up on me,
I'm gonna defend myself.

11:39.397 --> 11:41.157
Right. You want to put
some pressure on this.

11:41.491 --> 11:42.892
Can you walk to the ambulance by yourself?

11:43.440 --> 11:45.084
Oh, I feel a little light-headed.

11:45.481 --> 11:47.590
Maybe if you give me a 60-pound pack

11:47.591 --> 11:50.508
and I slung a buddy over my
shoulder, I could make it.

11:54.405 --> 11:55.727
Well, what did Nora say?

11:55.728 --> 11:58.592
Is she mad at me?
I didn't have a chance to talk to her yet.

11:58.593 --> 12:00.744
Why did you have to go and find him?
Well, why did you

12:00.750 --> 12:03.248
have to go and tell me that he
might be my father? Well, is he?

12:03.249 --> 12:05.417
No, but I had to go find
that out for myself.

12:05.418 --> 12:06.379
But no. No, he's not.

12:06.806 --> 12:09.189
God. Sarah, what are you doing here?

12:09.190 --> 12:11.300
I told you, I didn't want
to get involved in this.

12:11.301 --> 12:13.596
Tommy, things have gotten a
little more complicated.

12:13.597 --> 12:15.903
Kevin's gone over there to
suss out the situation.

12:15.904 --> 12:17.063
What situation?

12:17.064 --> 12:18.666
Brody is at mom's.

12:19.478 --> 12:20.680
Oh, my God!

12:20.755 --> 12:23.347
Yeah, and now I've gotta go
over there and apologize.

12:23.822 --> 12:25.151
I just... I thought I should warn you.

12:25.152 --> 12:27.859
Okay. I'm warned.
No, and one more thing, Tommy, please.

12:28.085 --> 12:30.778
I heard through the grapevine
that you're not happy at work.

12:31.115 --> 12:33.456
Maybe I've been a little hard on you.

12:33.457 --> 12:36.774
That's not the problem, okay?
I mean, let's face facts...

12:36.775 --> 12:39.543
I don't know the first thing
about the media business.

12:39.544 --> 12:41.118
I don't see a place for me there.

12:42.349 --> 12:44.460
We're probably better off
moving back to Seattle.

12:44.461 --> 12:46.332
No, don't say that. That is not an option.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.907
Do you understand me?
Honey, honey, if you are not happy,

12:48.908 --> 12:50.330
you know, we should talk about it.

12:50.636 --> 12:53.616
Excuse me.
Tommy, we can work this out. We can.

12:54.167 --> 12:56.216
Besides, mom loves you two being here.

12:56.217 --> 12:58.780
She wants you to get married,
give her lots of grandchildren.

12:58.781 --> 13:00.393
That's not gonna happen anytime soon.

13:00.394 --> 13:02.141
I love Seattle. I'm happy to go back.

13:02.142 --> 13:03.578
Don't make any rash decisions.

13:03.579 --> 13:05.108
We can figure this out, okay?

13:05.109 --> 13:06.700
Sarah, his happiness is
the most important...

13:06.701 --> 13:08.910
Look, would you please... can you
please let me... stop. Stop!

13:09.100 --> 13:09.935
Please.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.845
I haven't made up my mind.
I-I just want to think about it.

13:14.996 --> 13:15.711
Tommy.

13:16.766 --> 13:18.487
Look at all these burners.

13:18.488 --> 13:20.506
One thing about the motor
home... I miss cooking.

13:20.817 --> 13:22.714
You could run a restaurant with this setup.

13:22.988 --> 13:25.745
And you could change the
climate with that motor home.

13:25.746 --> 13:28.800
I love how you still get all
indignant if somebody breaks

13:28.801 --> 13:32.541
- the Nora Holden rules of conduct.
- Walker. Walker.

13:32.542 --> 13:34.113
Unknit your knickers, Mrs. Walker.

13:34.114 --> 13:36.616
I drive the motor home back
and forth to road games.

13:36.617 --> 13:39.583
It's cheaper than a motel,
and Lily can come with me.

13:42.090 --> 13:43.420
Hi. I'm Kevin.

13:43.515 --> 13:44.884
Uh, Nick Brody. Nice meeting you.

13:44.885 --> 13:47.845
Nice to meet you. And who are you?

13:47.846 --> 13:48.701
That's Lily.

13:49.398 --> 13:51.866
She's so sweet. How old is she? 14.

13:52.057 --> 13:54.712
She doesn't look 14. I miss having a dog.

13:54.713 --> 13:56.670
We used to have one when
we were kids... Bingo.

13:56.671 --> 13:58.406
But he got hit by a car. Ooh.

13:58.830 --> 14:01.118
Dad refused to ever let us get another one.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.980
What? That's just not true.

14:03.981 --> 14:06.579
Your father was brokenhearted
when we lost bingo.

14:06.580 --> 14:08.410
He just didn't feel emotionally up to

14:08.411 --> 14:10.089
being able to do that again.

14:10.518 --> 14:11.983
Well, that didn't keep him from getting

14:11.984 --> 14:13.692
a little toy poodle for holly.

14:15.616 --> 14:17.437
Is holly one of your kids? Ha!

14:18.033 --> 14:20.007
No. Um, no.

14:20.008 --> 14:22.574
She was an old maiden aunt of William's.

14:22.575 --> 14:24.322
He... he loved very much.

14:24.323 --> 14:25.146
Oh, yeah. I'll say.

14:26.357 --> 14:29.689
Why do I-I feel that there's
more to this story?

14:29.690 --> 14:32.168
Well, there's not. She's dead.
That's the end of that.

14:32.169 --> 14:34.274
And, uh, I hate to break this up,

14:34.275 --> 14:35.906
but I have an appointment.

14:35.907 --> 14:37.331
What do you mean? I only just got here.

14:37.496 --> 14:38.588
Well, it was great meeting you.

14:38.589 --> 14:41.141
Maybe I'll see you tonight.
Don't you want to get on the road?

14:41.142 --> 14:43.270
You don't want to get stuck
in rush-hour traffic.

14:43.271 --> 14:46.122
My engine's been a little balky,
so I'm gonna change the plugs

14:46.123 --> 14:47.638
and tighten the belts, and...

14:48.182 --> 14:50.435
I promise not to spill any oil

14:50.444 --> 14:52.337
on your pretty Pasadena street, Nora.

14:53.291 --> 14:54.280
Come on, Lil.

14:54.469 --> 14:56.011
- See you later.
- Yep.

15:00.545 --> 15:01.437
I like him.

15:01.438 --> 15:04.437
You don't like him.
You just like watching me squirm.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.766
Well, I am a little surprised
with the Saint William pretense.

15:07.842 --> 15:09.190
It's none of his business.

15:09.191 --> 15:11.628
I don't want him standing
around here, judging me.

15:11.629 --> 15:12.633
Well, how long does it take

15:12.670 --> 15:15.043
to tighten his plugs and change his belts?

15:15.986 --> 15:17.177
If I know Brody,

15:17.178 --> 15:20.010
it takes as long as he wants it to take.

15:21.194 --> 15:22.720
Do you really have an appointment?

15:22.721 --> 15:24.429
No, I don't have an appointment.

15:40.608 --> 15:41.523
Look who's here.

15:41.745 --> 15:43.780
Hi, Brody. Nice to see you.

15:44.850 --> 15:46.926
Bit of warning would've been nice.

15:46.927 --> 15:48.886
I was on my way to a
game down in San Diego,

15:48.887 --> 15:50.504
and I thought, why not? Ah.

15:51.058 --> 15:53.069
And I did call. That's right. You did.

15:53.326 --> 15:55.221
You did, indeed, from the driveway.

15:55.222 --> 15:57.687
Well, I thought spontaneity
was a virtue in this family,

15:58.427 --> 16:01.016
especially after you dropped
in on me at my office.

16:01.021 --> 16:02.543
- Ah, yes. 
- Crostini?

16:03.013 --> 16:04.049
Thank you.

16:05.243 --> 16:06.783
You know, my mother does not

16:06.784 --> 16:10.242
generally permit other
cooks in her kitchen.

16:10.243 --> 16:11.447
I didn't ask permission.

16:14.897 --> 16:16.395
Did you bring that nice dog of yours?

16:16.396 --> 16:18.638
Lily? Yeah, she's out in the r.V.

16:18.639 --> 16:20.824
- This is good. 
- I told ya.

16:24.561 --> 16:26.047
Well, look what blew in...

16:26.074 --> 16:27.711
a little birdie.

16:28.610 --> 16:29.555
I'm, uh...

16:29.815 --> 16:31.930
I'm just gonna... keep this warm.

16:32.592 --> 16:33.366
And, uh...

16:34.274 --> 16:36.155
I'll, uh, go get Lily.

16:36.156 --> 16:36.796
Wonderful.

16:39.336 --> 16:41.333
Wow, mom. Look at this incredible dinner.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.399
Isn't this great?

16:44.488 --> 16:45.158
Is that it?

16:45.159 --> 16:46.637
Is... is that your opening gambit?

16:46.638 --> 16:48.915
You... you think I'm gonna be
mollified with a dinner?

16:49.301 --> 16:51.049
Oh, g... I'm sorry. I really am.

16:51.050 --> 16:52.738
I had no idea he would just...

16:54.308 --> 16:56.068
What did you tell him about your father?

16:56.069 --> 16:56.799
Nothing.

16:57.395 --> 16:59.701
Just that he was dead.

17:01.038 --> 17:02.814
And so he just showed up?

17:02.815 --> 17:04.434
I guess that's all he needed to hear.

17:06.146 --> 17:07.998
Maybe you should be flattered.

17:08.635 --> 17:10.662
No, seriously, mom. Think about it.

17:10.663 --> 17:13.756
He's nice, he's kind to animals,

17:13.757 --> 17:16.645
he's very attractive, and
whoa, boy, can he cook.

17:17.840 --> 17:18.843
Oh! Sarah.

17:18.844 --> 17:21.826
God, I-I am not remotely attracted to him.

17:21.827 --> 17:23.021
He is not my type.

17:23.021 --> 17:25.148
I'm just saying that he was your type once.

17:25.785 --> 17:28.307
You...
Oh! I was 19 years old.

17:28.385 --> 17:30.095
I had not a clue in my head who I was

17:30.096 --> 17:32.009
or... or what I wanted out of my life,

17:32.030 --> 17:33.527
and people move on.

17:33.780 --> 17:36.079
Sarah, they just... move on.

17:37.919 --> 17:39.725
Hey, Paigey. How did you do?

17:39.726 --> 17:42.320
I came in third. Oh, my God.
That's fantastic.

17:42.321 --> 17:44.189
So, uh, when are you guys getting home?

17:44.190 --> 17:46.446
I want to feed Joaquin
and read him a story.

17:49.083 --> 17:50.610
Um... yeah.

17:51.686 --> 17:52.941
Listen, sweetie,

17:52.942 --> 17:55.640
I-I might be stuck here for a while.

17:55.641 --> 17:57.706
Something's come up. Um, but he's great.

17:57.976 --> 18:00.813
We changed him. I fed him, burped him.

18:00.814 --> 18:03.897
He's really happy, so don't wait up, baby.

18:03.898 --> 18:04.904
You must be exhausted.

18:04.951 --> 18:08.585
Mom, I have to spend time with my baby.
No, I know, honey.

18:08.586 --> 18:12.310
I just, um, I'll... I'll be home
as soon as I can okay? Bye.

18:12.311 --> 18:13.410
Oh, God.

18:14.485 --> 18:15.510
I lost him.

18:15.622 --> 18:16.499
Who?

18:17.044 --> 18:18.139
Joaquin.

18:19.020 --> 18:20.476
Jo-Joaquin? Tommy's.

18:20.924 --> 18:23.358
Yes. Yes, I must have left him at Tommy's.

18:23.359 --> 18:24.766
Who the hell is Joaquin?

18:26.077 --> 18:28.230
Look, believe me, I get it.

18:28.257 --> 18:30.324
But there has to be some alternative

18:30.325 --> 18:31.987
to moving back to Seattle, right?

18:32.268 --> 18:35.498
I mean, at least give it a chance here.

18:37.109 --> 18:39.722
Well, Sarah called me
with some great project

18:39.723 --> 18:41.029
that's supposed to turn my life around.

18:41.423 --> 18:43.676
That's good, right? I don't know.

18:43.677 --> 18:45.806
I guess if it keeps the
peace, maybe I'll do it.

18:46.931 --> 18:48.328
I know you don't want to hear this,

18:48.405 --> 18:50.639
but it wouldn't hurt if you went over there

18:50.640 --> 18:52.103
and allayed mom's fears a little.

18:52.328 --> 18:54.595
She's already wigging out
that Brody parked his r.V.

18:54.596 --> 18:57.507
In her driveway.
I hope that's not a euphemism.

18:57.508 --> 18:59.762
Oh, no. I don't think there's
any chance of that happening.

18:59.763 --> 19:00.583
If the r.V.'S rocking,

19:00.584 --> 19:01.799
it's 'cause mom's trying to blow it up.

19:02.290 --> 19:03.996
Well, I have to go there tomorrow

19:03.997 --> 19:07.165
and return Joaquin to Sarah.
You've met Joaquin?

19:08.287 --> 19:10.048
Yeah. He's out in my car.

19:10.049 --> 19:10.973
By himself?

19:12.528 --> 19:15.856
Well... he was sleeping so soundly,

19:15.857 --> 19:16.929
I didn't want to wake him up.

19:17.345 --> 19:20.582
You know, this was so
good, but a lot of it.

19:20.583 --> 19:24.284
So I-I really insist that you
take some of it with you.

19:24.490 --> 19:26.614
Nora, that's the biggest damn refrigerator

19:26.615 --> 19:28.243
I've ever seen in my life. You keep 'em.

19:31.277 --> 19:33.111
You're a good cook, Brody.

19:33.112 --> 19:35.825
Oh, I've taken it upon myself
to teach the boys on my team

19:35.826 --> 19:39.058
the finer points of Southern
Mediterranean cuisine.

19:39.059 --> 19:40.552
So, um, I guess

19:40.553 --> 19:42.389
you pretty much love what you're doing.

19:43.315 --> 19:45.747
Well, it's not hitting .400 in the majors,

19:46.358 --> 19:49.139
but baseball is baseball.

19:52.053 --> 19:53.243
I love the game.

19:54.487 --> 19:56.715
- I know that. 
- So do you, as I recall.

19:56.716 --> 19:59.141
No, no, no. I only went there to...

20:00.849 --> 20:01.803
Watch you play.

20:01.909 --> 20:05.106
Oh, come on. I remember you
pestering the hell outta me

20:05.107 --> 20:06.831
to let you in to the batting cage.

20:06.939 --> 20:08.931
And you may have a fuzzy memory of that

20:08.932 --> 20:10.427
after the beanball you took.

20:10.428 --> 20:13.227
Oh, my God, yes. I remember that very well.

20:13.228 --> 20:14.861
You refused to wear a helmet.

20:14.862 --> 20:16.787
I didn't want helmet hair.

20:17.356 --> 20:19.436
If you'll remember, though,
before that happened,

20:19.437 --> 20:21.276
I was pretty damn good. You were.

20:21.277 --> 20:22.791
I was. You had a natural swing.

20:22.792 --> 20:25.157
I had a natural swing.
That's when I started calling you slugger.

20:26.763 --> 20:27.372
Right.

20:30.772 --> 20:31.568
You know, I think I'll...

20:31.569 --> 20:33.265
I'll walk Lily around the neighborhood

20:33.351 --> 20:35.969
before I turn in. Want to join us?

20:35.970 --> 20:38.383
No, I-I have a book
waiting for me upstairs.

20:38.772 --> 20:40.017
Okay.

20:44.774 --> 20:46.044
Brody, look, I-I...

20:46.098 --> 20:48.570
Nora, I'm gonna take some very good advice

20:48.571 --> 20:51.623
I received today from a
wise person on the radio.

20:52.458 --> 20:54.275
I'm not gonna take anything for granted.

20:54.723 --> 20:57.785
And I'm gonna be respectful
of your feelings.

20:57.919 --> 21:00.066
I cooked this dinner to thank you

21:00.067 --> 21:02.843
for letting me park in front
of your house for a while.

21:02.844 --> 21:04.556
I don't have any agenda...

21:05.219 --> 21:06.691
Other than that.

21:08.540 --> 21:09.564
Okay?

21:11.544 --> 21:12.520
Okay.

21:12.922 --> 21:13.994
Yeah.

21:14.897 --> 21:16.081
Good night.

21:31.158 --> 21:32.134
Hey.

21:32.960 --> 21:33.904
Hey.

21:34.451 --> 21:36.322
Hey. Come on.

21:36.476 --> 21:37.759
Huh?! Oh!

21:37.760 --> 21:40.225
N-Nora, Nora, it's me. Don't scream.

21:40.533 --> 21:42.403
What are you doing?
How did you get in here?

21:42.404 --> 21:44.480
I'm sorry. The key was under the mat.

21:44.481 --> 21:47.078
I thought you said you had no agenda.
I don't.

21:47.168 --> 21:49.107
Lily was sick to her
stomach, so I let myself

21:49.108 --> 21:51.085
into the kitchen to make
her a little rice to eat.

21:51.086 --> 21:52.590
And then why are you up here?

21:56.211 --> 21:59.091
Oh, my God. What's she doing?

21:59.407 --> 22:01.391
I was at the stove, and I turned around

22:01.392 --> 22:03.663
just in time to see her
going up the stairs.

22:04.443 --> 22:06.795
She's been up pacing all night.

22:06.987 --> 22:09.483
I guess she was looking for
a quiet place to rest.

22:09.633 --> 22:11.890
Are you sure you don't
train her to do this?

22:12.260 --> 22:14.403
I swear. I'm not that hard up.

22:14.545 --> 22:17.889
Oh, now that I trained her to do. Well.

22:18.187 --> 22:20.043
She looks like she wants to stay with you.

22:21.292 --> 22:23.963
Well, she can stay here, but you cannot.

22:23.988 --> 22:25.807
We've never spent a night apart.

22:27.407 --> 22:31.087
So I'm going to, uh, sleep
downstairs on your sofa

22:31.643 --> 22:33.755
so... in case she needs me.

22:34.185 --> 22:35.354
Good night, Brody.

22:35.881 --> 22:38.176
Night, old girl. Be good.

22:38.177 --> 22:40.338
I-I'm gonna assume you're
not talking to me.

22:41.646 --> 22:42.864
Night, slugger.

22:54.363 --> 22:55.421
Mm.

23:03.546 --> 23:07.163
We don't just make luxury
cars, we make Cadillacs.

23:07.384 --> 23:08.532
What is going on?

23:08.533 --> 23:09.220
I can't believe you did this.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.771
Paige, stop shouting.
Luc and Cooper are still asleep.

23:11.772 --> 23:13.430
Did you really think you could fool me

23:13.431 --> 23:16.814
with this off-brand baby?
Look, I got in late.

23:16.815 --> 23:19.116
I didn't want to wake you
and have you worrying,

23:19.117 --> 23:21.629
so I just... I got that
one out of the pantry.

23:21.911 --> 23:24.086
Where is Joaquin?

23:26.117 --> 23:28.069
At grandma's, I think.

23:29.750 --> 23:30.688
Wait. You think?

23:30.689 --> 23:34.385
I know. He is. He's fine.
Did you even feed him last night?

23:34.386 --> 23:36.011
Paige, he's fine. It's not even 7:00.

23:36.012 --> 23:39.004
He's probably still asleep.
Mom, this is serious.

23:39.005 --> 23:41.676
Sweetheart, I had the most
horrible day yesterday.

23:41.677 --> 23:43.030
Everything I did was wrong.

23:43.031 --> 23:45.604
If I could write in the mirror
backwards, I would scrawl,

23:45.605 --> 23:49.637
"I'm sorry" on my forehead with
a sharpie just to save time.

23:51.112 --> 23:53.680
Listen, we'll... we'll go
over later to grandma's

23:53.681 --> 23:55.733
and we'll feed him together, okay?

23:55.734 --> 23:57.730
I have a soccer tournament in an hour,

23:57.731 --> 24:01.682
and you're driving the car pool.
Oh, God. I completely forgot.

24:01.854 --> 24:04.878
Okay. You go upstairs, get
dressed, and we'll just...

24:04.879 --> 24:07.390
We'll use this bag as joaquin's stand-in

24:07.505 --> 24:09.265
until we pick him up later.

24:09.872 --> 24:10.993
That's cheating.

24:12.498 --> 24:13.722
Oh, come on, Paige.

24:13.723 --> 24:17.082
This baby's white, all-purpose,
weighs 5 pounds.

24:17.120 --> 24:18.546
Hmm. That's all that matters.

24:18.547 --> 24:22.034
F.Y.I., mom, as if you cared,

24:22.217 --> 24:24.440
Joaquin is whole-wheat.

24:31.800 --> 24:32.984
What's up, Zach?

24:34.326 --> 24:36.103
How's the, uh, how's the head?

24:37.293 --> 24:38.317
It hurts.

24:39.662 --> 24:41.390
Did you come here to check on my head?

24:43.451 --> 24:44.890
No. I, uh...

24:47.631 --> 24:48.719
Look, man...

24:49.817 --> 24:51.016
I know a lot of us

24:51.321 --> 24:53.239
have had trouble adjusting
to civilian life,

24:53.240 --> 24:54.878
but I don't think living
in a park is the answer,

24:54.879 --> 24:55.981
man. What, are you spying on me?

24:55.982 --> 24:57.726
No, I'm not spying on you.
I'm here to help.

24:58.612 --> 25:00.849
I put in a few calls to the v.
A. To see about getting you

25:00.850 --> 25:02.974
into a program.
And what do they tell you at the v.A.?

25:02.975 --> 25:04.340
Look, I know it's a drag, but if you

25:04.341 --> 25:06.837
put your name on a list... I've
been on a list for a year.

25:07.624 --> 25:10.353
They stopped putting names on
the list because it never moves

25:10.354 --> 25:11.900
because there are no programs for me.

25:11.901 --> 25:14.138
They told me three months.
Six... six months,

25:14.139 --> 25:15.787
tops. That's if I have a drug problem.

25:16.475 --> 25:18.681
They have programs for that, but
I don't have a drug problem.

25:18.682 --> 25:20.618
I have a place-to-sleep problem.

25:21.164 --> 25:22.956
I considered getting a drug problem,

25:22.975 --> 25:25.102
but I don't really like drugs,
and I'd have to steal things

25:25.103 --> 25:27.887
to pay for them, which could
solve my place-to-sleep problem,

25:27.888 --> 25:31.536
only jail isn't a good option for me.

25:33.356 --> 25:34.619
But thanks for trying.

25:36.342 --> 25:37.965
Look, obviously it's a screwed
up system, yeah, but...

25:37.966 --> 25:39.597
Give it up. You can't help.
Don't be so sure.

25:39.598 --> 25:41.141
Look, if your issue is a place to sleep,

25:41.142 --> 25:42.630
Zach... You know what, bro?!

25:44.054 --> 25:45.430
You're gonna end up with
some issues of your own

25:45.431 --> 25:47.174
if you don't get out of my face!

25:49.744 --> 25:51.521
You understand my problem now?

25:52.365 --> 25:54.732
I'm not afraid of your problem.

26:03.182 --> 26:05.427
She used to chase grounders for hours.

26:05.428 --> 26:07.124
But she's lost interest.

26:07.612 --> 26:09.705
How old is she? 14.

26:11.021 --> 26:13.789
Longest relationship with
a female I ever had...

26:14.105 --> 26:15.656
And the most successful.

26:16.633 --> 26:18.520
Well, you're a luckier man than I am.

26:18.905 --> 26:20.432
My ex-wife will only speak to me

26:20.433 --> 26:23.521
to tell me when and where I'm
allowed to see my daughter.

26:25.298 --> 26:26.706
Thought about getting a dog?

26:26.766 --> 26:28.908
I don't know.
I mean, we're living at my sister's

26:28.909 --> 26:31.070
so first we'd need to
find a place of our own,

26:31.071 --> 26:34.558
and then there's this
little issue of employment.

26:34.769 --> 26:35.712
Mm-hmm.

26:37.643 --> 26:39.019
What line of work you in?

26:39.111 --> 26:40.311
The honest truth?

26:43.007 --> 26:44.127
I'm not sure.

26:44.715 --> 26:45.743
Mm.

26:50.317 --> 26:51.572
I mean, the guy's seriously smart,

26:51.573 --> 26:52.850
and he's a decorated soldier.

26:52.851 --> 26:55.046
I guess, when he got out,
he... he couldn't adjust.

26:55.047 --> 26:56.455
Well, if I was shot at for years,

26:56.456 --> 26:57.738
I'd have anger issues, too.

26:57.739 --> 26:59.655
I mean, if you're not
vigilant every moment,

26:59.656 --> 27:02.745
you just... you get yourself killed.
You think?

27:03.195 --> 27:04.653
How do you just turn that off?

27:04.654 --> 27:08.011
You don't, you know?
You just... you learn to manage it.

27:09.723 --> 27:11.674
Look, if I didn't have you guys,
maybe I'd be in the same boat.

27:11.675 --> 27:12.916
Aw. Stop.

27:13.158 --> 27:15.427
So what are you gonna do for this guy?

27:16.778 --> 27:17.200
Hmm?

27:17.201 --> 27:19.153
I think I'm gonna try and
find him a place to live.

27:19.359 --> 27:20.566
Maybe he can get rid of his other problems.

27:20.567 --> 27:21.874
I mean, the guy's just had bad luck.

27:21.875 --> 27:23.827
Well, it sounds like
that's about to change.

27:25.711 --> 27:26.591
Hey.

27:26.592 --> 27:28.326
Oh, God. Not you, too.

27:28.327 --> 27:29.376
Nice to see you, mom.

27:29.377 --> 27:32.380
Don't pretend for one single
minute you're here to see me.

27:32.381 --> 27:35.222
Well, you and your ex-beau,

27:35.223 --> 27:36.624
who, by the way, just
showed me the motor home.

27:36.625 --> 27:39.244
Ma, have you seen it?
It's off the hook. Oh, God.

27:39.245 --> 27:41.933
I'll tell you, I wouldn't be
caught dead in that thing.

27:42.275 --> 27:43.712
Luckily, he's going tomorrow,

27:43.713 --> 27:45.900
so no more dirty looks from the neighbors.

27:45.901 --> 27:48.491
Okay, mom, I need you to
fill in joaquin's baby book.

27:48.541 --> 27:51.384
4:00 P.M., fed bottle, 6:00 P.
M., changed diaper,

27:51.385 --> 27:53.264
8:00 P.M., went to sleep,
in your handwriting.

27:53.265 --> 27:54.343
You know what? Isn't this cheating?

27:54.344 --> 27:56.206
No, quick, before Paige comes back.

27:56.625 --> 27:58.361
Oh, for God sakes. You know, stop.
Get your own, Sarah.

27:58.362 --> 28:00.522
This... that's my plate. Make yourself one.

28:01.075 --> 28:04.196
Oh, mom. These muffins are really good.

28:04.197 --> 28:05.926
I didn't make them. Brody did.

28:05.927 --> 28:08.479
I knew I loved that guy.
He is a really good cook.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.241
Oh, for goodness sakes.

28:10.243 --> 28:11.243
Oh, here.

28:13.870 --> 28:15.190
Mom, I really want a dog.

28:15.191 --> 28:17.828
So was your walk nice? Very successful.

28:17.829 --> 28:19.312
Mom, I'm serious about a dog.

28:19.313 --> 28:21.761
Considering our record with the fake baby,

28:21.797 --> 28:24.200
I'm not sure we're really
ready for a live animal.

28:24.201 --> 28:26.632
Don't call him a fake baby.
His name's Joaquin.

28:27.011 --> 28:29.220
Sorry. Why do you have a
fake baby named Joaquin?

28:29.301 --> 28:30.792
A school project. Oh.

28:30.793 --> 28:32.372
Hey. Oh, hi, guys.

28:32.373 --> 28:35.282
Wow. I, uh, didn't expect
to see everybody here.

28:35.283 --> 28:37.882
Well, evidently, Brody is a very big draw.

28:37.883 --> 28:41.354
Yeah. Look, mom, I-I need to
talk to you about something,

28:41.355 --> 28:43.451
but I don't want you to get upset.

28:43.625 --> 28:46.001
I'm gonna leave you all to
your family discussion.

28:46.002 --> 28:47.002
No, no, no, you don't have to go.

28:47.003 --> 28:50.171
I'm gonna see if I can get Lily
to eat some more of this rice.

28:50.189 --> 28:52.424
You got things to talk about anyway.
Dinner's at 7:00.

28:52.425 --> 28:54.505
See you later. Come on, girl.

28:55.687 --> 28:57.428
What, Tommy? What? What's happening?

28:57.429 --> 28:58.548
Brace yourself.

29:00.685 --> 29:01.837
I got a job.

29:02.601 --> 29:03.265
Great. What?

29:03.266 --> 29:04.044
Yeah, I'm gonna be the

29:04.045 --> 29:06.950
business manager of a baseball team.
That's great.

29:06.951 --> 29:09.956
Oh, God. Did Brody set this up? Yeah.

29:09.957 --> 29:11.205
Where is it?

29:14.367 --> 29:15.740
In Phoenix. What? Sarah...

29:15.741 --> 29:16.820
I spent all afternoon trying
to talk him out of it.

29:16.821 --> 29:18.341
What happened to you making an offer...

29:20.448 --> 29:22.160
S-stop. Stop.

29:22.221 --> 29:23.470
Look, I've already made up my mind.

29:23.526 --> 29:27.040
I'd really appreciate some support. Aah!

29:28.175 --> 29:29.583
Paige, are you okay?

29:32.735 --> 29:33.964
Who did this?

29:33.965 --> 29:36.174
Oh, God. You gave me a heart attack.

29:36.904 --> 29:39.705
The muffins. Oh, God. Brody...

29:39.959 --> 29:42.272
Brody must have...
Oh, my God. I ate one.

29:42.273 --> 29:43.569
What's wrong with the muffins?

29:43.631 --> 29:45.598
Listen, honey, you know,
I can fix this thing.

29:45.599 --> 29:47.262
But we're just in the
middle of something here.

29:47.263 --> 29:49.486
You can't fix this. You ruined it.

29:52.157 --> 29:53.814
Will someone please tell me
what the hell is going on

29:53.815 --> 29:55.256
with the muffins? I had four of 'em.

29:55.257 --> 29:57.636
Justin, could you just go talk to Paige?

29:57.637 --> 29:59.323
She'll explain everything. Please.

29:59.324 --> 30:01.518
She... she's gonna explain the muffins?
Yes, just...

30:01.519 --> 30:03.114
Paige. Tommy, listen,

30:03.115 --> 30:06.060
you... you can't hang your
future on... on Brody.

30:06.061 --> 30:09.680
It's not about him. It is about him.
God, it... it... it is.

30:10.054 --> 30:12.326
Sarah, if you hadn't stuck your nose in

30:12.327 --> 30:14.630
where it didn't belong, none
of this would have happened.

30:14.631 --> 30:16.876
Oh, my God. Here we go. It's all my fault.

30:16.877 --> 30:19.192
Except let's not forget, mom,
that this whole thing happened

30:19.193 --> 30:21.696
because you lied about your
wedding date to hide the fact

30:21.697 --> 30:24.929
that you were knocked up when
you were 19 and unmarried.

30:25.285 --> 30:26.213
Sarah.

30:26.891 --> 30:27.833
Oh, God.

30:32.067 --> 30:34.020
Grandma, you got pregnant?

30:34.341 --> 30:36.133
Sweetheart, l-listen, listen...

30:36.910 --> 30:38.191
Hey... oh.

30:38.878 --> 30:40.095
Paige.

30:43.215 --> 30:44.399
Look,

30:44.764 --> 30:47.006
Tommy, please don't jump into this.

30:47.007 --> 30:47.610
Please listen to me.

30:47.611 --> 30:50.034
No, mom. You want to end up like him?

30:50.035 --> 30:52.131
What, do something I love?

30:52.245 --> 30:55.557
Oh, God. I can't let him do this again.

30:55.603 --> 30:56.627
Oh!

30:59.788 --> 31:00.908
Brody!

31:02.099 --> 31:02.716
Brody!

31:02.717 --> 31:03.434
Oh, thank God, Nora.
I need you to drive me.

31:03.435 --> 31:05.397
You knew I didn't want my son to leave.

31:05.420 --> 31:08.027
I need you to leave here now!
Lily is sick. I can't wake her up.

31:09.433 --> 31:10.901
I think she's dying.

31:23.606 --> 31:24.590
I know you didn't sign up for this move,

31:25.281 --> 31:28.064
and it's... it's out of the blue,

31:28.065 --> 31:29.073
but...

31:30.657 --> 31:32.081
I think we can make it work.

31:35.731 --> 31:37.475
I want you to be happy, Tommy.

31:38.783 --> 31:40.463
I just wish I knew what you wanted.

31:42.997 --> 31:45.877
I know... I want you to come with me.

31:46.840 --> 31:48.259
But not if you think it's a mistake.

31:48.260 --> 31:49.509
If you do that...

31:50.415 --> 31:51.871
We'll both be unhappy.

31:56.033 --> 31:57.058
I'll try.

32:04.868 --> 32:06.341
You do what you want to.

32:08.108 --> 32:09.451
Don't do it for me.

32:11.538 --> 32:12.690
I love you.

32:13.690 --> 32:15.291
And I want to be with you.

32:17.687 --> 32:18.807
I love you, too.

32:31.397 --> 32:33.893
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Hey. Just me. Just me.

32:34.211 --> 32:35.731
What's up with you, man? What?

32:36.240 --> 32:37.871
Don't you know you could
get killed doing that?

32:38.335 --> 32:41.663
Well, I-I knocked, but
you didn't answer, so...

32:44.181 --> 32:45.125
Move over.

32:46.222 --> 32:47.230
Don't.

32:47.791 --> 32:48.654
Don't be stupid.

32:48.655 --> 32:51.167
Indulge me. I'm having a flashback.

32:51.678 --> 32:53.643
And you marines never leave
a buddy on the battlefield,

32:53.644 --> 32:54.653
right?

32:56.861 --> 32:58.556
What is wrong with you, seriously?

32:58.557 --> 32:59.721
Look, you came home with problems.

32:59.722 --> 33:02.525
I came home with problems.
I'm still not exactly sure

33:02.526 --> 33:04.848
why we're... we're getting shot
at and blown up over there,

33:04.849 --> 33:06.848
but it's certainly not so
I can sleep in a warm bed

33:06.849 --> 33:08.641
in my own house while you sleep out here.

33:09.763 --> 33:12.196
So unless you help me figure
out a way to help you,

33:12.197 --> 33:15.893
then I'm... I'm here for
the duration, all right?

33:20.473 --> 33:21.497
How is she?

33:22.090 --> 33:23.384
She made it through the surgery.

33:23.385 --> 33:24.521
They got the tumor.

33:24.641 --> 33:26.578
And he said dogs can get along fine

33:26.579 --> 33:29.779
without their spleens.
Oh, thank God. I'm so relieved.

33:30.678 --> 33:31.814
Yeah. You should go.

33:32.849 --> 33:35.216
I'm gonna stay, wait for her to wake up.

33:38.313 --> 33:41.144
Well, that's okay. Uh, I'll wait with you.

33:46.180 --> 33:47.469
And just so you know,

33:47.517 --> 33:50.072
I didn't cook up anything
for Tommy's benefit.

33:50.073 --> 33:52.778
That team really did need
a good business manager.

33:53.925 --> 33:55.568
Look, I just want him to be happy.

33:55.569 --> 33:57.441
He's been through so much.

33:57.841 --> 33:59.569
He seems like a nice guy.

34:00.007 --> 34:01.320
You did a good job with him.

34:02.345 --> 34:03.962
Then why does he keep leaving?

34:06.151 --> 34:08.054
Some of us just can't stay put.

34:13.501 --> 34:15.117
Brody, why are you here?

34:22.799 --> 34:25.119
When Sarah came to see me

34:25.799 --> 34:28.822
and introduced herself as
Nora Walker's daughter,

34:29.471 --> 34:31.063
for a split second, I was afraid

34:31.063 --> 34:33.286
she was there to tell me that you had died.

34:34.052 --> 34:35.746
And in that moment, I...

34:38.112 --> 34:40.193
I thought about all my regrets

34:40.812 --> 34:44.251
and all the times I
wanted to look you up...

34:44.668 --> 34:45.693
And didn't.

34:46.951 --> 34:48.551
I thought I'd lost my chance.

34:49.786 --> 34:50.891
So I...

34:53.092 --> 34:54.739
I decided, it was now or never.

34:57.033 --> 34:58.471
You have regrets?

34:58.899 --> 35:00.177
Well, my baseball career

35:00.178 --> 35:02.257
didn't turn out exactly how I'd hoped.

35:04.220 --> 35:06.688
But if... if I'd given up that dream

35:06.689 --> 35:07.631
and gotten married,

35:07.632 --> 35:09.569
I would've made your life miserable.

35:11.218 --> 35:12.643
And now that I've seen you,

35:12.644 --> 35:14.931
I realize, I made the right decision.

35:15.137 --> 35:19.361
You married the right guy.
William was a good husband.

35:19.394 --> 35:21.021
You got everything you wanted.

35:23.097 --> 35:24.025
Yeah.

35:24.548 --> 35:26.174
I got the family I wanted.

35:26.175 --> 35:27.119
Mm-hmm.

35:29.311 --> 35:31.196
But William was not a good husband.

35:32.495 --> 35:34.443
You were right. He was a cheater.

35:34.444 --> 35:37.578
He had multiple affairs,
a long-term mistress.

35:37.579 --> 35:39.930
He lied and embezzled and...

35:42.143 --> 35:44.415
He hurt a lot of people, including me.

35:47.518 --> 35:49.053
Why didn't you tell me?

35:51.163 --> 35:54.871
Because I-I-I didn't want you to know...

35:57.865 --> 35:59.191
I had regrets.

36:01.799 --> 36:03.287
I never liked him.

36:04.163 --> 36:05.284
I know that.

36:06.221 --> 36:07.166
You two were as different

36:07.167 --> 36:09.214
as two people could possibly be.

36:09.215 --> 36:10.576
Hmm. Still are.

36:12.379 --> 36:14.516
But given that he's dead,

36:15.552 --> 36:17.375
I like my chances better now.

36:19.579 --> 36:22.075
Brody, you are the same guy now

36:22.076 --> 36:23.081
you were back then.

36:23.082 --> 36:26.041
You're just passing through,
looking for the next game.

36:26.318 --> 36:28.237
And I have to tell you that I'm...

36:29.161 --> 36:32.393
Not the same little girl.

36:33.115 --> 36:34.204
Sure you are.

36:35.433 --> 36:36.458
Just older...

36:37.652 --> 36:38.979
And wiser.

36:40.541 --> 36:42.285
I've only managed half of that.

36:43.643 --> 36:44.907
But I'm working on it.

37:02.354 --> 37:03.699
Paige, listen,

37:03.742 --> 37:06.493
things were very different back then.

37:07.055 --> 37:10.271
So do you wish you'd used birth control?

37:11.296 --> 37:12.144
Well...

37:14.572 --> 37:15.365
Um...

37:15.366 --> 37:16.885
I can't help you there.

37:17.615 --> 37:19.512
Well, you know, that's hard to answer,

37:19.513 --> 37:21.725
because I gave birth to your mother,

37:21.726 --> 37:24.702
and I love your mother very much.

37:25.011 --> 37:27.470
So you see, it all turned out beautifully.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.276
So then you're glad you got pregnant.

37:31.712 --> 37:34.113
Listen, Paige, I'm sure it's
been a shock to find out

37:34.114 --> 37:36.803
that your grandmother was
an unwed, pregnant teen.

37:37.540 --> 37:38.884
But this is just not a situation

37:38.885 --> 37:40.597
that we expect to find you in.

37:40.674 --> 37:43.214
You have so many opportunities.
You're a smart girl.

37:43.215 --> 37:45.568
We've talked about this so many times.

37:46.446 --> 37:47.752
Perhaps we shouldn't dwell

37:47.753 --> 37:50.566
on any mistakes that
grandma might have made.

37:51.070 --> 37:52.446
Why, thank you, Sarah.

37:52.539 --> 37:53.843
And I think Paige realizes

37:53.844 --> 37:56.323
that sometimes, people make mistakes.

37:56.944 --> 37:58.199
Well, just so you guys know,

37:58.200 --> 38:00.791
I'm not even gonna think
about having a family

38:00.792 --> 38:03.764
until I've finished with
college and graduate school...

38:03.765 --> 38:05.350
Mm-hmm. And... and I have a career.

38:05.351 --> 38:06.903
Well, honey, you don't
want to wait too long.

38:06.904 --> 38:08.209
Sometimes, as you get older,

38:08.210 --> 38:10.731
fertility problems can creep...
Mom. Mnh-mnh.

38:10.732 --> 38:13.966
You know what? Paige is going to
do whatever is right for her.

38:14.564 --> 38:17.121
Great. Then can I go
finish my homework now?

38:17.122 --> 38:18.898
Sure, honey. Take your tea.

38:18.988 --> 38:20.691
Okay. Bye. Love you, grandma.

38:20.692 --> 38:21.891
Love you.

38:28.562 --> 38:29.503
I am sorry, mom.

38:29.504 --> 38:32.125
I-I never meant for her to hear all that.

38:32.126 --> 38:34.365
I just... I blurted it out.
I was so mad at you.

38:34.481 --> 38:35.810
It's all right, Sarah.

38:37.201 --> 38:39.890
Is there anyone else I'm
supposed to apologize to?

38:40.224 --> 38:41.376
Joaquin, maybe.

38:41.858 --> 38:45.149
Oh, yeah. I feel bad about him.

38:50.020 --> 38:51.981
Yeah, we're gonna drive down
all the time for games.

38:51.982 --> 38:53.650
And we should get one of
those big land yacht things

38:53.651 --> 38:55.263
that Brody has, and we can
park it out in front of mom's

38:55.264 --> 38:57.728
when we're not using it.
Say good-bye to her yet?

38:58.174 --> 39:00.096
Yeah. She's, uh, still pretty miffed,

39:00.097 --> 39:02.064
but she tried to put on a good face.

39:02.480 --> 39:04.209
Where'd you get these muffins?
They're amazing.

39:04.210 --> 39:06.041
Uh, Brody made 'em.
I got, like, a dozen of 'em.

39:06.042 --> 39:07.961
Yeah, nobody else wanted
any when they found out

39:07.962 --> 39:10.807
the main ingredient was powdered Joaquin.

39:13.155 --> 39:14.324
This is Joaquin?

39:14.513 --> 39:16.738
Uh, yeah. What's the big deal?

39:17.996 --> 39:19.500
You had to know him, I guess.

39:19.645 --> 39:20.898
Uh, fine. More for me.

39:20.899 --> 39:22.675
Yeah, and me. Can you put a few in a bag?

39:22.746 --> 39:24.685
Mm-hmm. Hey, look, we're gonna
go say good-bye to Sarah.

39:24.686 --> 39:27.183
You want to come with? Uh, no.

39:27.184 --> 39:28.942
No, actually, I didn't get
a lot of sleep last night,

39:28.943 --> 39:31.904
so I'm gonna crash out for a few hours.
All for a good cause.

39:32.250 --> 39:34.336
Seems like a lost cause. All right.

39:34.337 --> 39:36.741
I'm gonna pack this up for you,
and I'll walk you out. All right.

39:36.742 --> 39:39.126
Hey, you know, uh, Brody's
leaving today, too.

39:39.681 --> 39:42.898
I hate to say it, it's sad, but
I'm gonna miss him. Justin.

39:43.086 --> 39:43.886
Yep.

39:46.460 --> 39:47.436
Zach.

39:50.101 --> 39:52.461
Oh, my God. Come in, come in.
These are my brothers.

39:52.462 --> 39:55.752
This is Tommy. This is Kevin.
This is Zach. Hey.

39:55.753 --> 39:58.599
Hey. Is this a bad time?
No, no, not at all. Come on in.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.641
Uh, you're just in time for chow.
Hey, look, we're gonna go, man.

40:00.642 --> 40:02.212
Yeah. Sure. All right. Good to see you.

40:02.213 --> 40:05.158
All right. Tommy. Here you go.

40:06.356 --> 40:07.988
Come on in. You, uh, you hungry?

40:08.576 --> 40:09.464
Yeah, sure.

40:09.465 --> 40:12.249
Great. All right. I got some muffins.

40:17.992 --> 40:21.159
Well, it's very cozy.

40:21.160 --> 40:22.787
I can see why you like it so much.

40:22.796 --> 40:23.317
You sure you don't want to

40:23.318 --> 40:26.399
take a spin around the block?
No, thank you.

40:26.400 --> 40:27.495
I'll let you drive.

40:27.496 --> 40:29.307
I don't want to be booted
out of the Sierra Club.

40:29.308 --> 40:32.204
Yeah, 'cause their parties are so much fun.

40:33.660 --> 40:36.876
Well, have a safe trip.

40:38.558 --> 40:39.565
Good luck.

40:39.701 --> 40:40.821
You, too, Nora.

40:43.222 --> 40:44.614
It was great seeing you.

40:48.622 --> 40:49.885
Great seeing you, too.

41:21.637 --> 41:22.408
Mom.

41:22.688 --> 41:24.080
Yeah. There you are.

41:24.530 --> 41:26.885
Ah. Wow.

41:26.886 --> 41:28.822
It's so quiet with Brody gone.

41:29.863 --> 41:31.799
He was kind of larger than life, wasn't he?

41:32.293 --> 41:33.797
I like the quiet.

41:35.359 --> 41:37.360
Cabernet Sauvignon,

41:37.506 --> 41:38.514
'93.

41:40.972 --> 41:42.795
So how did you two leave things?

41:43.466 --> 41:44.666
What things?

41:45.391 --> 41:46.448
You know...

41:46.668 --> 41:48.892
Your relationship.

41:49.262 --> 41:50.797
Do you think you'll see each other again?

41:50.798 --> 41:52.629
Look, if there's one thing
I know about Brody,

41:52.630 --> 41:55.116
you can't count on him for anything, ever,

41:55.117 --> 41:56.605
much less to show up.

41:56.986 --> 41:58.235
When he drives off,

41:58.236 --> 41:59.337
that may be the very last

41:59.338 --> 42:01.880
time you ever see him. Well, I hope not.

42:04.762 --> 42:05.594
Yeah.

42:06.692 --> 42:07.588
Really?

42:08.263 --> 42:10.710
Okay. 
Okay, good, bye.

42:11.524 --> 42:12.580
Who was that?

42:12.737 --> 42:13.776
Brody.

42:14.332 --> 42:16.811
Well, that didn't take long.
What did he want?

42:17.630 --> 42:18.488
Tuna fish.

42:18.489 --> 42:21.142
Why would he want tuna fish?

42:21.435 --> 42:23.946
Well, apparently, she likes it.

42:25.461 --> 42:26.485
Lily.

42:27.275 --> 42:28.923
She needed bed rest.

42:30.460 --> 42:33.180
Yeah. I wonder if we'll
ever see Brody again.

42:33.726 --> 42:35.360
You just never know with him, do you?

42:35.626 --> 42:37.370
Shut up and open the tuna fish.

42:38.981 --> 42:39.973
Thank you.
