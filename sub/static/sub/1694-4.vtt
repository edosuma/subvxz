Nucky: <i>You're a thief,</i>
<i>right, Nate?</i>

00:02.231 --> 00:04.332
- Mr. Thompson...
- Who was your wheelman?

00:04.366 --> 00:05.500
Rowland Smith.

00:05.534 --> 00:06.635
( gunshot )

00:06.670 --> 00:08.871
It was settled, Dean...
the territories.

00:08.906 --> 00:11.907
- Jake says you're encroaching.
- Is that what Jake says?

00:11.941 --> 00:14.110
- You deny it?
- Without equivocation.

00:14.144 --> 00:15.713
You gotta respect
the boundaries.

00:15.748 --> 00:18.683
- I'm asking you are you deaf?
- Hey, his kid's deaf.

00:19.719 --> 00:22.456
Al: <i>I play the mandolin.</i>
<i>And sing to him</i>

00:22.490 --> 00:25.861

00:25.895 --> 00:27.596
Margaret: <i>Dr. Landau is trying</i>
<i>to convince</i>

00:27.631 --> 00:29.333
my husband and I to sponsor

00:29.367 --> 00:31.168
a women's health clinic
at the hospital.

00:31.202 --> 00:33.204
There are some delicate topics

00:33.238 --> 00:35.174
which would have to be avoided.

00:35.208 --> 00:37.110
Let's set the table over again.

00:37.144 --> 00:39.780
I'll send you home tomorrow
with a full month's supply.

00:39.814 --> 00:41.115
Square enough deal.

00:41.150 --> 00:42.684
Masseria we need
to settle with.

00:42.718 --> 00:44.086
<i>He's gonna come looking</i>
<i>for his piece.</i>

00:44.120 --> 00:45.488
Lucky: <i>We're sending Benny</i>
<i>up to Harlem.</i>

00:45.522 --> 00:46.722
<i>We're dealing in Midtown.</i>

00:46.756 --> 00:48.758
I sell two bindles of powder

00:48.792 --> 00:50.160
<i>Joe Masseria gets cut in?</i>

00:50.194 --> 00:51.261
That's how he'll see it.

00:51.295 --> 00:53.229
Hey, kid.

00:53.264 --> 00:54.931
Joe Masseria says hello.

00:54.966 --> 00:56.433
Hey!

00:59.270 --> 01:01.671
I understand you boys
are heading back to New York.

01:01.705 --> 01:03.373
- Where'd you hear that?
- Nucky's man.

01:03.407 --> 01:04.640
I think we're gonna
stick around awhile.

01:04.675 --> 01:06.842

Should I answer it?

03:15.585 --> 03:17.919
Should I? Well?

03:17.953 --> 03:21.055
- Oh, just answer it already.
- Hello?

03:21.090 --> 03:23.591

- Katy. I'm looking for Owen.

03:23.625 --> 03:25.626
- No, no, no, no.
- Yes, Mr. Thompson.

I was just in the loo.

03:36.105 --> 03:38.640
I didn't hear the phone.
Jesus.

03:38.675 --> 03:41.576
- The two of you?
- <i>Sir?</i>

03:41.611 --> 03:43.745
- Where in the bathroom?
- No. No, no, I...

03:43.779 --> 03:46.214
- <i>Have you read the paper?</i>
- No, I have not.

03:46.248 --> 03:48.249
<i>Well, read one</i>

03:50.952 --> 03:53.820

I'd have kept speaking

04:06.068 --> 04:09.370
I don't have to.

04:09.405 --> 04:11.940
I'd better go.

04:11.974 --> 04:15.243
He's in a bad humor again.

04:15.277 --> 04:19.314
Well, then it won't
matter if you're late.

04:21.017 --> 04:22.784
Will it, Mr. Poofles?

04:26.755 --> 04:29.290

04:49.977 --> 04:52.178

These are sesame.

04:54.147 --> 04:56.115
Why ain't he at school?

04:56.149 --> 04:58.417
Bellyache.

05:02.724 --> 05:04.158

05:04.192 --> 05:06.895
Let me take
a look at you, champ.

05:06.929 --> 05:09.697
Hey.

05:09.732 --> 05:11.232
What the hell's this?

05:13.136 --> 05:15.103
Sonny, go play.

05:15.138 --> 05:17.206
- Hey, your ma's talking to you.
- Go play.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.341
Go play.
Come on.

05:21.244 --> 05:23.312
Go on.

05:24.948 --> 05:28.017
He came home with it yesterday.
I rang the headmaster.

05:28.052 --> 05:30.220
Some new boy, he's a bully.

05:30.254 --> 05:32.823
Picking on a kid
almost stone-cold deaf?

05:32.857 --> 05:36.094
They all are, Al.
That's why he's there.

05:36.128 --> 05:39.464
Boys will be boys, whether they
can hear each other or not.

05:46.107 --> 05:49.343
- Kid's got to toughen up.
- ( Toy clatters )

05:51.747 --> 05:54.315
- <i>( men clamoring )</i>
- Coming through. Coming through.

05:56.453 --> 05:57.954
Mickey:
<i>All right, pipe down.</i>

05:57.988 --> 05:59.956
<i>Mr. Thompson wants a word.</i>

05:59.990 --> 06:04.127
As some of you may know, our
contact at Tabor Heights...

06:07.465 --> 06:10.601
Sheriff Victor Sickles
died recently

06:10.636 --> 06:12.703
as a result of what
the "Atlantic City Press"

06:12.738 --> 06:15.039
has deemed a tragic accident.

06:15.073 --> 06:17.142
<i>( door opens )</i>

06:18.177 --> 06:19.644
Given as how the chief witness

06:19.679 --> 06:21.180
to this unfortunate occurrence

06:21.215 --> 06:23.517
<i>was a Mr. Gyp Rosetti</i>
<i>of New York,</i>

06:23.551 --> 06:26.187
it's quite possible there's
a bit more to the story.

06:26.221 --> 06:29.491
That being the case,
until further notice,

06:29.525 --> 06:32.361
all shipments
to Mr. Rothstein

06:32.395 --> 06:34.497
will use back roads only,

06:34.531 --> 06:36.766
<i>avoiding Tabor Heights</i>
<i>altogether.</i>

06:36.800 --> 06:38.501
( men murmuring )

06:38.535 --> 06:41.404
In the middle of January?
The roads are sheets of ice.

06:41.438 --> 06:43.006
<i>And where are we</i>
<i>gonna get gas?</i>

06:43.040 --> 06:44.807
That's your problem, isn't it?

06:45.876 --> 06:47.977
You sure this is a good idea?

06:49.213 --> 06:50.846
What the fuck
you asking him for?

06:50.881 --> 06:53.482
I just thought
when it comes to...

06:53.517 --> 06:56.686
You just what?
I already said how it is.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.722
All right, Nuck.
I'm sorry.

06:58.756 --> 07:01.992
Get up to Tabor Heights, find
out what the fuck is going on.

07:03.028 --> 07:04.194
Yes, sir.

07:04.229 --> 07:06.931
You know that coast road
that heads through Hammond?

07:06.965 --> 07:09.133
Head up there,
check out the roads.

07:09.168 --> 07:11.569
See how icy they actually are.

07:11.604 --> 07:14.139
- You know the one I mean.
- Okay.

07:16.476 --> 07:18.577
What's being done
about Rowland Smith?

07:18.611 --> 07:22.047
- Who?
- Rowland Smith.

07:22.082 --> 07:23.817
Nate Honig's wheelman.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.150
The sack of shit who
robbed this place.

07:25.151 --> 07:28.053
That job was left
to Manny Horvitz.

07:28.087 --> 07:30.522
Oh, where's he been lately?

07:30.556 --> 07:32.091
I don't have enough on my mind?

07:32.125 --> 07:33.759
I have to start checking
your fucking work, too?

07:33.793 --> 07:35.628
<i>Make sure things</i>
<i>are being handled?</i>

07:35.662 --> 07:36.896
Owen: <i>It won't happen</i>
<i>again, sir.</i>

07:36.930 --> 07:40.099
Find this guy.
Use Agent Sawicki if you have to.

07:40.167 --> 07:41.634
You want the feds involved?

07:41.735 --> 07:43.670
He's on the goddamn payroll.
Make him earn it.

07:45.473 --> 07:47.241
Any more second-guessing?

07:47.275 --> 07:49.610
I'll get on it straightaway.

07:53.482 --> 07:56.283
- Nucky, can I have a word?
- About what?

07:56.318 --> 07:59.487
This Rosetti business,
the whole Tabor Heights thing.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.922
If you've got a complaint,
talk to Mickey.

08:01.957 --> 08:04.158
I don't.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.527
It's just that I'm back now.

08:06.561 --> 08:08.028
I'm well aware of that.

08:08.063 --> 08:10.998
Then let me earn, Nucky.
I did my time like you asked.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.467
Let's get something straight.

08:13.501 --> 08:17.904
Allowing you to simply go to jail is
the last gift I'll ever give you.

08:25.078 --> 08:29.081
This is rather infelicitous
language, isn't it?

08:33.885 --> 08:36.386
- Vagina?
- It is a medical term.

08:36.422 --> 08:38.590
I've never enjoyed
the sound of it.

08:38.624 --> 08:41.393
I've never liked brussels sprouts,
but I don't deny they exist.

08:41.427 --> 08:43.663
What a peculiar analogy.

08:43.697 --> 08:45.331
What term would you prefer?

08:45.366 --> 08:48.334
The entire area
is problematical.

08:48.369 --> 08:50.270
You do acknowledge
certain subjects

08:50.304 --> 08:52.273
would be difficult
to discuss without it?

08:52.307 --> 08:55.209
Intercourse,
fertilization, birth.

08:55.244 --> 08:58.046
You imagine yourself quite
wicked, don't you, Doctor?

08:58.080 --> 09:00.281
The jackanapes at the back
of every classroom,

09:00.315 --> 09:02.850
mistaking his sniggering
for the wit of the world.

09:02.885 --> 09:05.586
That sounds more like
my cousin Francis.

09:10.259 --> 09:11.827
"Pregnant."

09:13.162 --> 09:15.664
Another problematical area?

09:15.698 --> 09:18.567
"Gravid" has a noble ring.

09:20.236 --> 09:21.904
Will they even know
what that means?

09:21.938 --> 09:23.772
Is it not your intention
to instruct them?

09:23.807 --> 09:25.307
"With child"?

09:25.342 --> 09:27.409
Ah.

09:27.444 --> 09:29.511
"Monthly time."

09:29.545 --> 09:32.114
You are at odds
with "menstruation"?

09:32.148 --> 09:34.550
- It's good Latin.
- A regrettable neologism.

09:34.584 --> 09:37.686
The Federal Children's Bureau
has already published a series

09:37.720 --> 09:40.188
on prenatal care and
"menstruation" is what they use.

09:40.222 --> 09:43.158
The indiscretion of politicians
is of no concern to me.

09:43.192 --> 09:46.094
I will be attending the class

09:46.129 --> 09:48.497
to make sure my instructions
are followed.

09:50.600 --> 09:51.967
And these are?

09:52.002 --> 09:54.069
Gifts for the women.

09:55.605 --> 09:57.272
"Kotex."

09:57.307 --> 09:59.542
Sanitary napkins, Sister.

10:01.144 --> 10:03.279
These are sold
openly in stores?

10:03.313 --> 10:06.149
They are a relatively
new product.

10:06.183 --> 10:08.651
Perhaps you yourself...

10:17.895 --> 10:20.029
Well...

10:20.064 --> 10:23.599
let's hope our evening students
aren't quite so sensitive.

10:52.163 --> 10:54.764
Looks like you've stepped
straight into my trap.

10:54.799 --> 10:56.332
What?

10:56.367 --> 10:59.268
You know, like I was
gonna arrest you.

10:59.303 --> 11:01.537
Why would you do that?

11:01.572 --> 11:03.206
Just making a little joke.

11:03.240 --> 11:05.408
Mr. Thompson's a busy man.

11:05.442 --> 11:07.910
I have nothing better to do?

11:07.944 --> 11:11.647
Came out here in the middle
of the day, didn't you?

11:11.681 --> 11:13.715
Is this Rowland Smith's
place or not?

11:13.750 --> 11:17.052
That's what the Philly
office says.

11:18.821 --> 11:20.722
You spoke to other
agents about this?

11:20.757 --> 11:23.125
Just the one

11:23.159 --> 11:25.594
that I can trust.

11:25.628 --> 11:28.664
You mean the one
that's crooked.

11:34.971 --> 11:37.105
Looks like it's locked.

11:37.140 --> 11:40.008
Thanks for clearing that up.

11:48.551 --> 11:49.885
( whistles )

11:49.919 --> 11:52.954
Rowland Smith's
been a busy fella.

11:55.691 --> 11:58.193
Owen:
At least half of this is ours.

11:58.227 --> 12:00.462
It's all ours now.

12:00.496 --> 12:02.631
You sure he's showing up?

12:02.665 --> 12:04.533
Sawicki:
This is his main drop.

12:04.567 --> 12:05.901
Says your man in Philly.

12:05.936 --> 12:08.404
Well, he would know,
wouldn't he?

12:08.438 --> 12:11.107
And what's stopping him
from tipping Smith off?

12:11.141 --> 12:13.042
Sawicki:
<i>Why would he do that?</i>

12:13.077 --> 12:16.446
Because he's never
bothered to catch him.

12:25.191 --> 12:27.059
Call me when he gets here.

12:27.093 --> 12:29.895
I'll take care of it.
You've my word.

12:29.930 --> 12:31.564
You needn't involve yourself.

12:31.598 --> 12:33.099
Is that what I asked you?

12:33.134 --> 12:36.003
You've mentioned low profiles.

12:36.037 --> 12:39.406
I'm trying to oblige.

12:40.308 --> 12:41.709
Ahem.

12:47.048 --> 12:49.382
Go buy a personality.

13:02.963 --> 13:04.631
( chattering )

13:04.665 --> 13:06.199
Eli:
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

13:06.233 --> 13:09.802
<i>Rosetti's gassing up,</i>
<i>Sickles is at the next pump.</i>

13:09.837 --> 13:12.939
He completely douses
himself with gasoline.

13:12.974 --> 13:15.108
Then for some fucking reason,

13:15.143 --> 13:17.077
decides that it's a
good time for a smoke.

13:17.111 --> 13:18.778
Look, what's the difference?

13:18.813 --> 13:20.413
The man was your partner.

13:20.448 --> 13:22.716
What I'm saying is,
it don't matter.

13:22.750 --> 13:24.384
The situation's being handled.

13:24.418 --> 13:25.819
Meaning what?

13:25.853 --> 13:27.854
Me and the boys,
we're taking care of it.

13:27.889 --> 13:29.623
You just said
you couldn't arrest them.

13:29.657 --> 13:31.524
I'm not talking
about arresting them.

13:31.559 --> 13:33.193
I'm talking about
handling them.

13:33.227 --> 13:35.662
<i>I got a load coming through here</i>
<i>tomorrow night, Deputy Ramsey.</i>

13:35.697 --> 13:37.398
I'm the sheriff now.

13:37.432 --> 13:38.933
And I still got a load
coming through.

13:38.967 --> 13:41.435
It's fine.
Same as always.

13:41.470 --> 13:44.805
You boys go about
your business.

13:44.839 --> 13:47.408
Leave these dagos to us.

13:49.244 --> 13:51.512
<i>( engine starts )</i>

13:56.518 --> 13:58.452
I don't like this.

13:58.486 --> 14:00.454
Let the man do his job, Eli.

14:00.488 --> 14:02.956
You ain't the only
sheriff ever lived.

14:02.991 --> 14:05.592
Get in the car.

14:05.626 --> 14:08.028
- ( piano playing )
- ( People laughing )

14:21.243 --> 14:23.444
Postcard from Johnny.

14:23.478 --> 14:26.013
"Greetings from Naples.

14:26.048 --> 14:29.750
I haven't seen this many Italians
since we were back in Brooklyn."

14:29.784 --> 14:32.186
( laughs )

14:34.389 --> 14:36.223
What the fuck is this?

14:36.258 --> 14:37.892
Cash.
What do you mean?

14:37.926 --> 14:39.427
It's sticky.

14:39.461 --> 14:43.398
Little schmutz.
I don't know, I just ate.

14:43.433 --> 14:45.567
Even your money reeks.

14:45.635 --> 14:46.968
Fuck you talking about?

14:47.003 --> 14:50.038
Would it kill you to pony up for
a decent shave once in a while?

14:50.073 --> 14:51.873
A little Bay Rum.

14:51.908 --> 14:53.542
Gives me a rash.

14:53.576 --> 14:55.110
Jake, I'm serious.

14:55.144 --> 14:58.580
You know I love you, but you
smell like a sardine's twat.

14:58.614 --> 15:00.648
I mean, what does
your wife say?

15:00.682 --> 15:04.618
"Why didn't I marry
Milton Korntragger?"

15:04.653 --> 15:06.887
- <i>( girls laugh )</i>
- Your whores, then.

15:06.922 --> 15:08.956
I pay 'em not to notice.

15:08.990 --> 15:11.092
18th up to Harrison.

15:11.126 --> 15:14.628
I got the rest of
my collections tonight.

15:16.097 --> 15:18.131
- Where you going?
- Take a leak.

15:18.166 --> 15:20.734
That's why beer
is so profitable.

15:20.769 --> 15:23.537
We don't sell it,
we only rent it.

15:26.876 --> 15:28.743
Personal hygiene, Jake.

15:28.777 --> 15:31.512
It makes a big impression.

15:34.716 --> 15:36.350
"How was
your day, honey?"

15:36.385 --> 15:38.986
I love her and all, but my day?

15:39.021 --> 15:40.888
This happened
and then that happened

15:40.922 --> 15:43.090
and then the next thing.
That's the day.

16:04.012 --> 16:05.713
Now you gotta go
through this whole...

16:05.747 --> 16:09.049
<i>( door opening )</i>

16:12.921 --> 16:15.189
Hi there.

16:15.223 --> 16:16.757
Don't move.

16:16.792 --> 16:19.060
<i>Check him.</i>

16:23.532 --> 16:25.733
Just for coneys.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.668
Who are you?

16:27.703 --> 16:29.838
Ask you the same question.

16:29.872 --> 16:32.006
You friends of my folks?

16:32.040 --> 16:33.674
Do we look friendly?

16:33.709 --> 16:37.179
You seem okay.
Don't know about him, though.

16:38.948 --> 16:41.649
They don't like it
if I'm late for dinner, so...

16:42.818 --> 16:45.753
- What's your name?
- Lon Chaney.

16:45.788 --> 16:48.623
( grunts )

16:48.657 --> 16:50.525
Norma Talmadge.

16:50.560 --> 16:52.895
( grunts )

16:55.365 --> 16:57.332
Baby Peggy.

17:02.672 --> 17:03.939
Rowland Smith.

17:03.973 --> 17:06.441
You're mean to children.

17:06.476 --> 17:08.676
Aren't you the dog's bollocks?

17:08.711 --> 17:10.512
Is that a good thing?

17:12.281 --> 17:14.483
Yeah, I need
the Ritz-Carlton.

17:17.186 --> 17:18.987
What used to come up
from Atlantic City

17:19.021 --> 17:21.723
comes right through here,
straight in off the ocean.

17:21.758 --> 17:23.125
Cut out the middleman.

17:23.159 --> 17:26.494
We sail out, load up, off-load
here right on the beach.

17:26.529 --> 17:28.163
Gonna have to do it at night.

17:29.833 --> 17:31.934
We'll probably need
some boats, too.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.869
I'm new to this.
I'm sorry.

17:33.903 --> 17:35.370
You've been with us a year.

17:35.405 --> 17:37.973
What do I know about the ocean?
I'm from Yonkers.

17:38.007 --> 17:39.641
- Excuse me, miss.
- Sir?

17:39.676 --> 17:42.211
One of these days I'm gonna
take you in the back,

17:42.246 --> 17:43.746
show you how to
really make sauce.

17:43.780 --> 17:46.882
But I don't know how to cook.

17:48.051 --> 17:51.087
You stir,
I'll provide the heat.

17:54.424 --> 17:56.191
<i>( door opens )</i>

18:13.142 --> 18:15.309
Could I have one?

18:16.712 --> 18:18.512
How old are you?

18:18.547 --> 18:20.381
16 next month.

18:20.415 --> 18:22.049
Sir.

18:22.084 --> 18:24.952
- You shouldn't smoke.
- I don't.

18:26.421 --> 18:28.122
Then why do you want
a cigarette?

18:29.357 --> 18:31.592
See what all the fuss is about.

18:35.731 --> 18:37.932
You trying to charm me, kid?

18:37.966 --> 18:40.067
Is it working?

18:40.102 --> 18:41.969
What do you think?

18:44.339 --> 18:46.040
You gonna hit me again?

18:46.075 --> 18:48.610
I'm not opposed to it.

18:48.644 --> 18:50.578
You know who I am, Rowland?

18:50.613 --> 18:52.013
Answer straight.

18:52.048 --> 18:53.949
You're Nucky Thompson.

18:53.983 --> 18:56.318
You gave us
a Christmas turkey once.

18:56.352 --> 18:58.186
When did I do that?

18:58.221 --> 18:59.788
1914.

18:59.822 --> 19:02.257
I was six.

19:03.526 --> 19:06.128
Boy, was Ma grateful.

19:10.834 --> 19:12.968
Is this how you thank me?

19:13.003 --> 19:14.704
How do you mean?

19:14.738 --> 19:17.840
Stealing my merchandise.

19:19.876 --> 19:22.177
I guess I didn't think
you'd mind.

19:22.212 --> 19:24.346
Why the hell
would you think that?

19:24.380 --> 19:26.448
I don't know.
Whenever I see you in the paper,

19:26.482 --> 19:28.850
it looks like
you're having a good time.

19:31.621 --> 19:34.556
Anyway, I didn't steal
it all from you.

19:34.591 --> 19:36.191
Who else?

19:36.226 --> 19:38.961
A lot of it belongs to
Waxey Gordon in Philadelphia.

19:38.995 --> 19:41.764
Did he give your mother
a turkey, too?

19:41.798 --> 19:43.900
( chuckles ) Heck, no.

19:43.934 --> 19:46.936
- He's a crook.
- ( Chuckles )

19:53.912 --> 19:56.080
Tell me what you want
to happen here.

19:56.114 --> 19:58.149
What's that mean?

19:58.183 --> 20:01.652
It's not as expected. The fault's
mine for letting it get this far.

20:01.687 --> 20:05.590
I'll take responsibility
and your hands stay clean.

20:27.944 --> 20:30.212
Have one on me.

20:34.783 --> 20:37.017
Need a light.

20:38.186 --> 20:41.389
<i>( cars approaching )</i>

20:41.423 --> 20:43.424
Expecting someone?

20:43.458 --> 20:44.859
Man: <i>Federal agents.</i>
<i>Get your hands up.</i>

20:44.893 --> 20:46.327
Man #2: <i>Get 'em up.</i>
<i>Hands up.</i>

20:46.361 --> 20:49.196
All right, boys. Nice and slow.
Nice and slow.

20:49.230 --> 20:51.431
Go around front.
Go around front.

20:55.903 --> 20:57.670
What's the story, Rowland?

20:57.704 --> 20:59.705
Beats me.

20:59.740 --> 21:02.575
They're Prohees out of Philly.

21:02.609 --> 21:04.844
They've kind of
been following me.

21:04.878 --> 21:06.312
Arsed-out little shite.

21:06.346 --> 21:08.614
- Just trying to get a leg up.
- You know any of them?

21:08.649 --> 21:10.883
Rowland: <i>That tall fed</i>
<i>with the 12-gauge,</i>

21:10.918 --> 21:13.319
<i>he's in</i>
<i>Waxey Gordon's pocket.</i>

21:13.353 --> 21:16.556
- Anything else?
- Pretty sure they're here to kill me.

21:16.590 --> 21:18.058
- Enough with the bull...
- <i>( Gunshot )</i>

21:18.092 --> 21:21.528
- Jeez, it's not our...
- ( Gunshot )

21:21.562 --> 21:23.463
All right, let's go.
Do what you have to do.

21:23.497 --> 21:24.798
Watch the windows, boys.

21:31.839 --> 21:34.774
<i>( men talking )</i>

<i>I'm gonna check the cellar.</i>

22:26.060 --> 22:27.794
Man:
<i>Anything?</i>

22:27.828 --> 22:31.364
Just cobwebs and squirrel turd.

22:37.671 --> 22:39.305
Squirrel turds?

22:39.339 --> 22:41.507
That's rat shit.

22:45.511 --> 22:47.946
<i>( chatter continues )</i>

22:52.184 --> 22:54.485
( laughing )

22:55.454 --> 22:57.855
Hit me again.

23:01.260 --> 23:03.729
Picking up for Mr. Torrio.

23:07.901 --> 23:10.136
Give me a short one.

23:10.170 --> 23:12.972
Guzik, right?
Torrio's man.

23:13.006 --> 23:14.507
Yeah. I know you?

23:14.541 --> 23:16.709
Joe Miller.
I'm with Deanie O'Banion.

23:16.777 --> 23:18.244
Uh-huh. Okay.

23:18.279 --> 23:20.580
- Beer's better here, huh?
- How's that?

23:20.615 --> 23:24.251
I say the beer's better here
down on the South Side?

23:24.285 --> 23:26.286
Tastes the same to me.

23:26.321 --> 23:30.424
Well, can't trust
the water anyway.

23:30.458 --> 23:32.493
What water?

23:32.527 --> 23:35.229
Any water.
I don't know, I'm just...

23:35.263 --> 23:38.699
look, you drink, I'll drink.

23:38.733 --> 23:40.767
We're fine, right?

23:42.036 --> 23:44.304
Sure, we are.

23:48.742 --> 23:51.043
You called
Dean O'Banion a liar.

23:51.077 --> 23:53.212
- Huh?
- That day at Torrio's.

23:53.246 --> 23:56.414
- I don't really... - You got a big
mouth to match that big gut.

23:58.017 --> 23:59.951
Enjoy your beer, Joe.

23:59.986 --> 24:03.255
How can I with the stink
coming off of you?

24:07.059 --> 24:09.694
Walk away from me, Jumbo?

24:11.363 --> 24:12.997
I'm talking to you,
you fat fuck.

24:13.031 --> 24:15.199

- Came to collect?

24:15.234 --> 24:18.503
- Here.
- ( Groans )

24:19.638 --> 24:22.507
Have some more.

Get it on.

24:43.430 --> 24:45.331
Hurry it up, guys.
We don't have all night.

24:58.579 --> 25:00.881
Wait it out.

25:02.250 --> 25:04.785
And if they decide to
look down here again?

25:04.820 --> 25:06.954
<i>( footsteps )</i>

25:06.988 --> 25:11.258
Well, we're all in this
together, ain't we?

25:15.296 --> 25:17.731
The mouths of babes.

25:28.844 --> 25:30.344
What did we leave in the car?

25:30.379 --> 25:33.180
Nothing.
I always keep it clean.

25:33.215 --> 25:36.017
- The plates?
- <i>In Tunney's name.</i>

25:38.187 --> 25:40.956
Don't expect
he'll much mind now.

25:44.961 --> 25:47.196
Rowland: <i>I got maybe 50</i>
<i>if you need any.</i>

25:47.230 --> 25:49.132
Got 50 what?

25:49.166 --> 25:51.634
License plates.
Swap 'em around.

25:51.669 --> 25:53.970
That way, they can't
ever track us.

25:54.005 --> 25:56.973
That's your system, is it?

25:57.008 --> 25:59.108
Worked it out myself.

25:59.143 --> 26:03.846
Then what are they
doing out there?

26:03.880 --> 26:07.149
Just coincidence, I reckon.

26:08.851 --> 26:11.019
Pretty good run, though, huh?

26:14.122 --> 26:16.925
Kept us guessing.

26:16.959 --> 26:19.694
Not that hard, really,
if you don't mind me saying.

26:19.729 --> 26:22.965
- Why's that?
- Drive fast, flash the pistol.

26:22.999 --> 26:27.002
I mean, who wants to get all
killed over a few crates of booze?

26:30.106 --> 26:31.507
No one.

26:31.541 --> 26:33.809
That's how I see it, too.

26:33.844 --> 26:36.212
Shame about Nate, though.

26:36.246 --> 26:38.882
He was my partner.

26:38.916 --> 26:42.519
Oh, aye?
What happened to him?

26:42.553 --> 26:45.022
Feds got him.

26:46.458 --> 26:48.893
Guess he didn't have your luck.

26:48.927 --> 26:51.295
<i>( car doors shutting )</i>

Mr. Thompson.

Man #2:
<i>Yeah, I did.</i>

27:02.040 --> 27:04.108
Man:
<i>Well, check it again.</i>

27:20.692 --> 27:22.326
What the fuck are you doing?

27:22.361 --> 27:24.095
Like you said.

27:24.129 --> 27:26.231
One part laxative, Benny.

27:26.265 --> 27:28.733
You want them shitting themselves
all over Hester Street?

27:28.767 --> 27:30.435
Anything?

27:32.537 --> 27:34.705
Charlie and I need to talk.

27:36.474 --> 27:38.443
I think it's time
I got included.

27:38.477 --> 27:40.444
- Based on what?
- I stepped up.

27:40.479 --> 27:43.548
I did what I had to.
That means I stay in the room.

27:43.582 --> 27:45.550
You shot your wad off
in the middle of the street.

27:45.584 --> 27:47.786
- They went back minus one.
- Meyer did that.

27:47.820 --> 27:50.722
- I fucking gave him cover!
- Benny.

27:50.757 --> 27:53.726
We are certainly
gonna discuss this,

27:53.760 --> 27:55.995
but not right now, so...

28:05.170 --> 28:07.138
( sighs )

28:09.308 --> 28:13.111
I'm summoned.
At noon.

28:13.145 --> 28:14.679
I'll come with you.

28:14.713 --> 28:18.149
Meyer, Masseria hates that
<i>shayna punim</i> of yours.

28:18.184 --> 28:20.819
Now more than ever.

28:22.288 --> 28:24.189
You turn up,
who knows where this goes?

28:24.224 --> 28:26.759
He needs to understand
the way the world's heading.

28:26.793 --> 28:28.160
You're the one who said
come to terms.

28:28.194 --> 28:30.729
- That was before.
- Well, you see?

28:34.367 --> 28:36.369
This is the problem with you.

28:36.403 --> 28:38.504
Always very headstrong.

28:38.539 --> 28:40.306
Good thing I'm here
to talk some sense.

28:40.341 --> 28:42.375
( scoffs )

28:46.414 --> 28:48.482
Offer two.
Settle at five.

28:50.085 --> 28:52.687
Nothing west of Broadway,
nothing south of Grand.

29:00.162 --> 29:01.696
Anything else?

29:04.099 --> 29:06.500
Try not to sit by the window.

29:13.608 --> 29:16.843
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

29:16.878 --> 29:19.145
Ramsey:
<i>Tonight, 10:00 P.M.</i>

29:19.180 --> 29:20.680
Cobb:
<i>All set on our end.</i>

29:20.714 --> 29:22.448
McHugh: <i>Some tough customers,</i>
<i>these boys.</i>

29:22.515 --> 29:24.016
Ramsey:
<i>You sure you want to do this?</i>

29:24.050 --> 29:26.084
Think I'm gonna let
you fellas have all the fun?

29:26.119 --> 29:29.454
We'll meet by
the filling station.

29:29.488 --> 29:33.124
Pull the truck around back
and bring plenty of rope.

29:35.160 --> 29:36.927
All right, let me roll.
Let me roll.

29:36.962 --> 29:38.462
( laughs )

29:38.497 --> 29:40.197
Look at that, baby.
All mine.

29:40.232 --> 29:43.133
Hit me, tough guy.
Come on.

29:43.168 --> 29:45.403
Come on, hit me.

29:45.470 --> 29:47.471
Come on.

29:47.506 --> 29:48.806
Hit me.

29:48.840 --> 29:50.341
Come on, tough guy.
Hit me.

29:50.375 --> 29:53.244
Come on. What was that, huh?
Come on, hit me harder.

29:53.278 --> 29:55.213
What was that?
Harder than that.

29:55.247 --> 29:57.181
Come on, put your hands up.
Put your hands up.

29:57.216 --> 30:00.518
Put your hands up.
Like this in front of your face.

30:00.553 --> 30:02.654
In front of your face
like this.

30:02.688 --> 30:04.389
Okay? And you're gonna
throw your punch.

30:04.424 --> 30:06.024
You're gonna throw
your punch like bang!

30:06.059 --> 30:08.594
Come on, let me see what you got.
Come on.

30:08.628 --> 30:10.329
Come on!
Hit me!

30:10.363 --> 30:12.965
You got to hit me.
You gonna let people bully you, huh?

30:13.000 --> 30:14.634
Come on and hit me, huh?

30:14.668 --> 30:16.803
( crying )

30:22.776 --> 30:25.545
Come here.
Come here.

30:25.579 --> 30:29.215
Come here.
Come here. Shh.

30:30.484 --> 30:32.285
It's okay, Sonny.

30:32.319 --> 30:36.088
Shh. Come on.
Shh.

30:37.324 --> 30:39.258
It's okay.
Shh.

30:39.293 --> 30:41.795
It's okay.
Come here. Come here.

30:41.829 --> 30:44.097
Come on. Shh.

30:44.131 --> 30:46.232
Papa's got you.

30:46.267 --> 30:49.069
Yes. Yeah, yeah.
Yes, missus.

30:49.103 --> 30:51.705
Thank you.

30:51.739 --> 30:53.907
Mrs. Thompson
has no information.

30:53.942 --> 30:56.210
- Try over at Chalky's.
- I did.

30:56.244 --> 30:58.345
Lolly Steinman as well.

30:58.380 --> 31:00.914
Chippy in New York, then.

31:00.949 --> 31:04.585
Miss Kent has not
seen him either.

31:07.821 --> 31:09.956
How many for Rothstein?

31:09.990 --> 31:13.492
800.
Same as last time.

31:13.527 --> 31:15.294
I wouldn't do this, Mickey.

31:15.328 --> 31:18.030
Of course you wouldn't.
'Cause you're not in charge.

31:18.064 --> 31:20.065
Use your head, will you?

31:20.100 --> 31:22.835
There's no way through the back
roads and Tabor Heights is off-limits.

31:22.869 --> 31:25.203
Sheriff's on it.
You heard him yourself.

31:25.238 --> 31:27.306
The sheriff's been on
the job less than a week.

31:27.340 --> 31:28.774
And the last one got burned...

31:28.809 --> 31:31.077
Don't you have
some trucks to load?

31:31.945 --> 31:34.247
Sure thing, boss.

31:41.988 --> 31:44.589
- What, you hear something?
- No, I didn't hear anything.

31:54.566 --> 31:56.767
Couldn't sleep either?

31:58.637 --> 32:01.072
Not exactly a featherbed.

32:01.107 --> 32:03.942
Although that hasn't
been helping either.

32:05.545 --> 32:07.946
Doesn't seem to bother him.

32:10.483 --> 32:12.685
I'm not sure what does.

32:15.188 --> 32:17.489
More than a few nights
spent like this

32:17.524 --> 32:19.558
back in Ulster.

32:19.593 --> 32:21.627
How's that?

32:21.661 --> 32:24.529
You'd get your orders,
this or that address,

32:24.564 --> 32:27.366
and then count off the hours
till you finish the business.

32:29.302 --> 32:31.537
Wasn't the work, though.

32:32.839 --> 32:34.240
It was the waiting.

32:34.274 --> 32:36.275
Must have had your way
of getting through it.

32:36.309 --> 32:37.943
<i>Oh, aye.</i>

32:39.946 --> 32:42.447
Walk through the streets
of Coleraine

32:42.482 --> 32:44.949
in my head.

32:44.984 --> 32:47.352
Steps to the school.

32:47.386 --> 32:50.788
Steps to the church.
Steps to the greengrocer.

32:50.822 --> 32:52.756
( chuckles )

32:52.791 --> 32:56.059
That what you've
been doing all night?

32:59.131 --> 33:02.533
I have not thought
on the place in months.

33:05.637 --> 33:08.306
Sounds like
you're feeling at home.

33:11.043 --> 33:13.077
( sighs )

33:13.112 --> 33:15.046
I know who's in charge,
Mr. Thompson.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.548
Maybe you're not
happy about it.

33:16.582 --> 33:19.185
<i>It's not my satisfaction</i>
<i>that matters.</i>

33:22.089 --> 33:25.358
And what have I done
to earn your loyalty?

33:25.393 --> 33:28.228
You made a place for me.

33:31.767 --> 33:34.335
Now minus the soft soap.

33:35.571 --> 33:37.939
( laughs )

33:37.973 --> 33:40.575
You pay me.

33:57.926 --> 34:00.527
<i>( mandolin playing )</i>

34:04.632 --> 34:06.867
Jesus.

34:06.901 --> 34:08.969
What the fuck happened?

34:09.003 --> 34:12.172
- Joe Miller.
- Who?

34:12.239 --> 34:14.708
O'Banion's man.

34:14.742 --> 34:18.511
Last night
I was making my collection,

34:18.545 --> 34:20.847
he dry-gulched me.

34:20.882 --> 34:23.183
What, he hit you when
you wasn't looking?

34:23.217 --> 34:24.918
I was leaving the bar
at Keller's.

34:24.953 --> 34:27.853
- He's on the South Side?
- <i>Cracked me with a beer mug.</i>

34:27.889 --> 34:29.790
Split my head open.

34:29.824 --> 34:32.059
Irish fucking prick.

34:32.092 --> 34:34.061
Al, he made fun of me.

34:34.094 --> 34:37.063
- What?
- <i>I mean, he...</i>

34:37.098 --> 34:39.165
in front of everybody.

34:39.199 --> 34:41.467
( sighs )

34:41.502 --> 34:44.203
You think it doesn't bother me?

34:45.938 --> 34:48.739
I can't help how I smell.

34:50.476 --> 34:53.244
Hour after I wash,

34:53.279 --> 34:56.514
I already got to change my...

34:56.549 --> 34:58.350
Al?

35:01.788 --> 35:04.790
Margaret: <i>Women's health clinic.</i>
<i>St. Theresa's Hospital.</i>

35:04.824 --> 35:07.293
Free to all.
Women's health clinic.

35:07.327 --> 35:09.896
St. Theresa's Hospital.
Free to all.

35:09.930 --> 35:13.200
Ma'am, may I give
you one of these?

35:13.267 --> 35:14.534
- Miss.
- Pardon?

35:14.569 --> 35:16.270
Miss.
It's not my baby.

35:16.304 --> 35:18.973
You're welcome in any case.

35:26.915 --> 35:30.517
Excuse me, I'm from
St. Theresa's Hospi...

35:30.552 --> 35:33.620
Mrs. Shearer.
Hello.

35:33.654 --> 35:35.455
Yes?

35:35.489 --> 35:37.224
Margaret Thompson.
We met...

35:37.258 --> 35:39.693
I remember you.
What do you want?

35:39.727 --> 35:42.229
Something that might
interest you.

35:43.498 --> 35:45.265
It's a series
of classes intended...

35:45.300 --> 35:48.566
- I know about it already.
- The class?

35:49.768 --> 35:52.002
All of it.

35:52.037 --> 35:54.471
I thought the same thing myself.

35:54.506 --> 35:57.775
And truthfully I'm ashamed
by my ignorance.

35:57.809 --> 35:59.944
Then who are you
to lecture people about it?

35:59.978 --> 36:03.381
I'm not. We have a doctor
from the hospital staff.

36:03.415 --> 36:05.316
Please come if you can.

36:05.350 --> 36:08.153
Your own experience
will be valuable for...

36:08.187 --> 36:10.089
A two-cent piece
for each of them?

36:10.123 --> 36:13.392
It's only once a month.
Who's this?

36:13.427 --> 36:14.827
A lady from the hospital.

36:14.862 --> 36:17.263
- Is it Mr. Shearer?
- <i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

36:17.297 --> 36:18.798
This isn't about
our bill, is it?

36:18.832 --> 36:20.600
We got ourselves a little
behind, but I promise...

36:20.634 --> 36:22.068
No, not that at all.

36:22.102 --> 36:24.804
I just wanted to
tell your wife that...

36:24.839 --> 36:28.641
that I'm glad to see
she's doing so much better.

36:28.675 --> 36:30.410
<i>Well, we've said our prayers,</i>

36:30.411 --> 36:31.644
<i>but that's how the Lord</i>
<i>must have wanted it.</i>

36:31.645 --> 36:33.746
Yes, of course.

36:33.780 --> 36:36.348
But He spared Edwina
and we're blessed for that.

36:36.383 --> 36:39.285
The doctors had
some hand in it.

36:39.320 --> 36:41.354
I took the week off
to see her through.

36:41.388 --> 36:44.825
You just wanted to put your feet
up and smoke those awful cigars.

36:44.859 --> 36:47.227
And when she's up to it,
we'll try again.

36:48.463 --> 36:50.364
<i>We do appreciate</i>
<i>your good wishes, though.</i>

36:51.600 --> 36:53.501
Are we gonna spend
the whole day out here?

36:53.536 --> 36:55.804
Lead on, Mother.

36:57.006 --> 36:58.973
Ready, boys?

37:06.114 --> 37:09.083
Women's health class.
St. Theresa's Hospital.

37:09.117 --> 37:10.718
Free to all.

37:10.752 --> 37:13.720
Women's health class.
St. Theresa's Hospital.

37:17.859 --> 37:19.394
( speaking Italian )

37:19.384 --> 37:22.784
-

37:26.684 --> 37:28.184
-

37:29.482 --> 37:31.182
-

37:31.283 --> 37:33.783
-

37:34.284 --> 37:35.584
-

37:35.981 --> 37:37.481
-

37:39.382 --> 37:48.782
-

37:58.183 --> 38:01.883

38:02.284 --> 38:05.384
-

38:05.482 --> 38:08.182
-

38:08.183 --> 38:11.283
-

38:12.084 --> 38:15.484
-

38:15.584 --> 38:17.084
-

38:17.185 --> 38:19.287
You get a cut of the card game,

38:19.321 --> 38:22.290
a cut of the fence,
a cut of the booze.

38:25.094 --> 38:27.228
What's to give?
It's a sideline.

38:28.062 --> 38:30.962
-

38:31.060 --> 38:33.160
-

38:33.061 --> 38:38.461
-
-

38:39.262 --> 38:42.262
-

38:43.160 --> 38:46.360
-

38:49.061 --> 38:50.461
-

38:51.561 --> 38:53.261
-

38:53.262 --> 38:55.162
-

38:55.662 --> 38:58.762
-

38:58.763 --> 39:01.432
"We."
"We."

39:01.467 --> 39:04.369
Have a look around.

39:05.604 --> 39:07.905
There's just you and me.

39:07.940 --> 39:09.907
I have partners.

39:09.942 --> 39:13.044
( speaking Italian )

39:09.947 --> 39:11.547
-

39:12.044 --> 39:13.244
-

39:13.245 --> 39:16.045
-

39:16.546 --> 39:18.046
-

39:18.143 --> 39:20.443
-

39:20.444 --> 39:22.944
-

39:24.745 --> 39:27.345
-

39:27.346 --> 39:29.846
-

39:37.540 --> 39:41.040
-

39:44.441 --> 39:47.541
-

39:49.842 --> 39:55.542
-

39:56.543 --> 39:58.443
-

39:59.544 --> 40:02.144
-

40:05.545 --> 40:07.145
-

40:08.846 --> 40:12.546
-

40:14.443 --> 40:16.343
-

40:16.944 --> 40:19.344
-

40:20.145 --> 40:21.545
-

40:21.648 --> 40:23.149
No.

40:23.301 --> 40:25.301
-

40:27.102 --> 40:30.002
-

40:30.703 --> 40:34.103
-

40:34.804 --> 40:37.304
-

40:41.705 --> 40:44.405
-

40:44.406 --> 40:46.640
With your partners.

40:46.927 --> 40:49.827
-

40:50.028 --> 40:51.328
-

40:51.329 --> 40:53.229
-

40:53.230 --> 40:54.530
-

40:54.531 --> 40:59.631
-

40:59.632 --> 41:02.732
-

41:02.830 --> 41:06.530
-

41:06.530 --> 41:08.030
-

41:10.533 --> 41:13.668
gonna look very cheap.

41:18.274 --> 41:21.076
Mr. Doyle.
Why am I talking to you?

41:21.110 --> 41:23.178
Mickey:
<i>'Cause you called me.</i>

41:23.213 --> 41:25.781
- But why am I calling you?
- <i>Uh...</i>

41:25.815 --> 41:27.549
Why is that even occurring?

41:27.584 --> 41:31.754
If I had my liquor on the timely
basis your employer promised,

41:31.788 --> 41:34.523
if, in fact, I could
reach your employer,

41:34.558 --> 41:38.360
who now seems to think
acceptable business practice

41:38.395 --> 41:39.928
to disappear for days on end,

41:39.962 --> 41:42.597
this conversation
would not be taking place.

41:42.632 --> 41:45.167
And that would make me...

41:45.201 --> 41:47.102
very happy.

41:47.136 --> 41:49.704
Mickey:
<i>Yeah, I understand.</i>

41:49.738 --> 41:52.507
- <i>Listen, Mr. Rothstein.</i>
- I want what I paid for.

41:52.541 --> 41:55.810
- I want it now.
- <i>Okay, sir.</i>

41:55.844 --> 41:59.380
And I don't ever want to find
myself chatting with you again.

41:59.415 --> 42:01.750
- <i>Of course.</i>
- Is that clear?

42:01.784 --> 42:03.619
You'll have it
by tomorrow morning.

42:09.326 --> 42:11.494
That Rothstein,
warm as a lizard.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.463
- ( laughs )
- What did he say?

42:13.497 --> 42:15.532
That he's expecting
his delivery.

42:15.566 --> 42:18.302
<i>And what did</i>
<i>you tell him?</i>

42:18.336 --> 42:20.938
That it's coming.
What do you think?

42:20.972 --> 42:24.408
What do I think?
That you're a fucking idiot.

42:27.745 --> 42:30.947
Watch your step, Eli.
I'm your boss.

42:30.982 --> 42:34.784
Nucky explicitly said
to avoid Tabor Heights.

42:34.818 --> 42:37.653
I heard. There's no way
to use the back roads.

42:37.688 --> 42:39.622
Not till May at the earliest.

42:39.656 --> 42:41.323
So hold off
making the delivery.

42:41.357 --> 42:44.659
And get your brother's foot
up my ass? No, thanks.

42:44.694 --> 42:47.962
I'm telling you
not to do this, Mickey.

42:50.432 --> 42:53.233
I'm not doing nothing.
They are.

42:53.268 --> 42:55.402
( laughs )

43:04.245 --> 43:06.012
You're straight through
to New York.

43:06.047 --> 43:07.681
Gas up in Tabor Heights
and that's it.

43:07.715 --> 43:11.083
You stop for nobody.
Not even the law.

43:14.655 --> 43:16.789
<i>( music playing )</i>

43:16.824 --> 43:18.958
( people chatting )

43:24.164 --> 43:26.532
Tonight is my night.

43:31.937 --> 43:33.971
Hey.

43:36.308 --> 43:37.875
- ( crowd gasps )
- <i>( Music stops )</i>

43:37.909 --> 43:40.244
- <i>( woman screams )</i>
- Man: <i>He's got a gun.</i>

44:01.568 --> 44:04.003
<i>( grunting )</i>

44:06.239 --> 44:08.007
Man: <i>Easy!</i>

44:10.811 --> 44:12.145
Woman: <i>Stop!</i>

44:12.980 --> 44:15.282
Crowd:
Oh!

44:15.317 --> 44:18.219
( panting )

44:29.765 --> 44:32.266
You want to pick on people
who can't defend themselves?

44:32.301 --> 44:33.401
Huh?

44:33.435 --> 44:35.803
<i>Pay for his funeral.</i>

44:43.178 --> 44:45.946
<i>( men chatting )</i>

44:49.483 --> 44:52.285
What are they saying?

44:52.319 --> 44:55.221
I think they're wrapping it up.

44:55.255 --> 44:58.057
<i>( footsteps )</i>

44:59.693 --> 45:02.595
<i>( engines start )</i>

45:17.411 --> 45:20.079
( exhales ) They're gone.

45:24.584 --> 45:27.619
Nearly shit your breeches
there, didn't you, son?

45:27.653 --> 45:29.988
Heck, I wasn't scared.

45:30.022 --> 45:32.390
I was.

45:33.725 --> 45:36.427
Okay, I was, too.

45:38.864 --> 45:41.599
There'll not be a peep from me.

45:41.634 --> 45:43.702
He always this much fun?

45:43.736 --> 45:46.204
You should hear him
on the phone sometime.

45:46.239 --> 45:49.608
- ( laughs )
- <i>Canoodling with his girlfriend.</i>

45:49.642 --> 45:54.647
Well, I got bacon
and eggs in the icebox.

45:54.681 --> 45:58.284
<i>I can fry 'em up</i>
<i>if anyone's hungry.</i>

46:02.355 --> 46:04.890
Maybe they left
a bottle upstairs.

47:00.316 --> 47:02.151
Here we are.

47:02.185 --> 47:03.652
Come on.

47:03.687 --> 47:06.122
Hey, fellas.
Ready to make some dough?

47:10.828 --> 47:13.496
<i>Don't make a move</i>
<i>until Gyp says so.</i>

47:13.531 --> 47:15.999
<i>You're gonna help us</i>
<i>block the road.</i>

47:16.033 --> 47:18.201
<i>First shot,</i>
<i>then you move.</i>

47:18.236 --> 47:21.305
<i>Just keep</i>
<i>the road blocked.</i>

47:21.339 --> 47:23.140
( cocks gun )

47:23.175 --> 47:26.277
- <i>Don't be yellow now.</i>
- <i>Down in the shadows.</i>

47:29.015 --> 47:31.183
Rothstein's shipment
is on its way.

47:33.286 --> 47:35.321
By which route?

47:35.355 --> 47:37.523
Tabor Heights.

47:37.558 --> 47:40.159
Word came back it's clear.

47:40.194 --> 47:43.296
Did anyone wonder where we
were for the last 24 hours?

47:43.330 --> 47:45.865
If they did,
they were quiet about it.

47:54.642 --> 47:56.075
Well?

48:02.115 --> 48:03.782
You see this?

48:03.817 --> 48:07.586
See what?
There's nothing here.

48:07.620 --> 48:10.689
That's my point.
We've both got empty hands.

48:10.723 --> 48:12.757
What's that say to you?

48:14.526 --> 48:17.428
Find a better hideout?

48:17.462 --> 48:20.364
Mr. Thompson,

48:20.399 --> 48:23.367
you got to admit
I'm pretty good at this.

48:23.402 --> 48:25.703
I wouldn't go
boasting about it.

48:25.738 --> 48:28.773
Yeah, and I could say
I'd never do it again,

48:28.807 --> 48:31.809
but you wouldn't
believe me, would you?

48:31.844 --> 48:33.611
Probably not.

48:33.646 --> 48:35.546
So...

48:35.581 --> 48:39.550
so how's about
I come work for you?

48:39.585 --> 48:42.454
How would that go, Rowland?

48:43.489 --> 48:46.125
Well...

48:46.159 --> 48:48.995
put me behind the wheel,
box of shotgun shells,

48:49.029 --> 48:50.730
just let them try
stealing then.

48:50.764 --> 48:52.532
( chuckles )

48:54.235 --> 48:56.236
He doesn't like me.

48:56.270 --> 48:59.105
Can you blame him?

48:59.140 --> 49:01.708
Ain't I cool in a tight spot?

49:05.880 --> 49:07.314
You'll do.

49:07.348 --> 49:08.882
I know all the roads
around here.

49:08.916 --> 49:10.517
Best places to lie low.

49:10.551 --> 49:12.719
Best places to keep your stash.

49:12.753 --> 49:15.255
They won't ever catch me.

49:16.424 --> 49:18.458
We caught you, Rowland.

49:18.492 --> 49:21.027
Okay, but it wasn't easy.

49:21.062 --> 49:24.698
And Waxey Gordon, he ain't
nearly as smart as you.

49:24.732 --> 49:27.567
You could take as much
of his booze as you'd like.

49:27.602 --> 49:29.136
It's apples off a tree.

49:31.839 --> 49:33.707
Just tell me
what you want to do.

49:33.741 --> 49:36.443
You've sure got a lot of moxie.

49:36.477 --> 49:39.613
How else are you
supposed to get ahead?

49:42.784 --> 49:45.018
I thought you didn't smoke.

49:45.053 --> 49:47.254
Did I say that?

49:49.924 --> 49:52.626
- How old are you really?
- 19.

49:52.660 --> 49:56.263
So legally I'm allowed to drive.
Isn't that better?

50:01.736 --> 50:03.504
Have one of mine.

50:16.286 --> 50:19.322
<i>( car approaching )</i>

50:25.228 --> 50:27.563
- Mr. Kessler.
- Who's Mr. Kessler?

50:27.597 --> 50:30.366
- He's Mr. Thompson's driver.
- ( Gunshot )

50:45.947 --> 50:48.382
I thought you were
letting him go.

50:51.319 --> 50:53.520
Why would you think that?

50:56.223 --> 50:59.259
I misunderstood.

51:01.562 --> 51:04.364
As long as you understand now.

51:20.947 --> 51:23.916
<i>( cars approaching )</i>

51:33.893 --> 51:35.226
Stop!

51:35.261 --> 51:37.028
- Is that Eli?
- Looks like it.

51:37.062 --> 51:39.397
Fuck that.
Mickey said don't stop for nobody.

51:39.431 --> 51:41.933
- <i>( honks horn )</i>
- Stop!

51:41.967 --> 51:44.102
- Stop!
- ( Honks horn )

51:45.204 --> 51:47.705
It's an ambush!
Wait!

51:47.740 --> 51:50.976
Wait!
Stop!

51:52.378 --> 51:55.013
Stop!
It's an ambush!

51:55.047 --> 51:57.983
It's a fucking ambush!

51:59.352 --> 52:03.088
Eli:
<i>It's a fucking ambush!</i>

<i>Right under his coat.</i>

<i>You want that?</i>

52:57.710 --> 52:59.211

<i>Where we dumping these?</i>

<i>That'll take all night.</i>

<i>Get the podunks to do it.</i>

53:05.486 --> 53:08.121
Man #2: <i>Jeez, this one</i>
<i>crapped his pants.</i>

53:08.155 --> 53:10.757
I need a wallet.

53:22.137 --> 53:25.640
Which one of them waitresses
do you think is cuter?

53:25.674 --> 53:28.843
The little one
with the bobbed hair.

53:33.316 --> 53:35.617
I'm gonna fuck the redhead.
