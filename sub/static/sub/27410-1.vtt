00:59.128 --> 01:01.268
- You'd
think after all this time

01:01.302 --> 01:03.546
this would feel less
like a hangover.

01:06.652 --> 01:09.207
Maybe she was drunker
than I thought.

02:19.725 --> 02:21.589
I know how this looks.

02:23.557 --> 02:25.386
I know how you all think.

02:26.594 --> 02:28.389
But let's put it this way.

02:29.701 --> 02:35.189
There comes a point where
survival becomes just another job.

02:35.224 --> 02:38.330
Sweat and elbow grease
moves the world forward.

02:40.090 --> 02:44.198
In this and in all
things, it's repetitive.

02:44.233 --> 02:46.096
It's necessary.

02:48.202 --> 02:48.858
And it's lonely.

02:50.135 --> 02:54.208
But the thing is, I
know love exists.

02:54.243 --> 02:55.727
I felt it.

02:55.761 --> 03:00.283
That pure tunnel vision that
only true love can give.

03:00.318 --> 03:02.389
I felt it first hand.

03:02.423 --> 03:03.700
But it was never my own.

03:04.632 --> 03:06.634
It was always for someone else.

03:06.669 --> 03:08.774
From someone else.

03:08.809 --> 03:10.120
Never mine.

03:12.468 --> 03:15.125
- Hi, I'm Emily Roberts.

03:17.404 --> 03:18.819
Hi, I'm Emily.

03:20.130 --> 03:22.857
- Then
one night someone shows up

03:22.892 --> 03:24.411
and everything changes.

03:25.550 --> 03:28.794
They look into my eyes and
I know they can see me.

03:30.140 --> 03:31.211
The real me.

03:32.626 --> 03:36.561
Love is finally just for me.

03:39.149 --> 03:40.806
You never forget
something like that.

04:15.531 --> 04:16.394
- Emily.

04:23.124 --> 04:24.229
Where have you been?

04:24.264 --> 04:26.680
I've had the police looking
for you, I was worried.

04:26.714 --> 04:29.303
- There's
a method to all of this.

04:29.338 --> 04:31.685
While I am them, I live as them.

04:31.719 --> 04:33.894
Plain sight being the
best camouflage.

04:33.928 --> 04:34.860
- Where you going?

04:34.895 --> 04:37.415
- Most
people can't tell.

04:37.449 --> 04:38.174
Most.

04:38.208 --> 04:39.486
- Who are you calling?

04:39.520 --> 04:41.626
- The police, they told me to
call as soon as you were back.

04:41.660 --> 04:43.213
- James I've only
been gone for...

04:43.248 --> 04:44.387
- Three days.

04:44.422 --> 04:46.320
Emily, you have been gone
for three days.

04:46.355 --> 04:47.563
And not even a text.

04:49.219 --> 04:53.500
- It hasn't been that long.

04:54.811 --> 04:55.674
James.

04:56.848 --> 04:57.918
- What are you doing?

04:57.952 --> 04:59.471
Stop that.

05:04.890 --> 05:05.753
- James.

05:07.583 --> 05:08.480
James stop.

05:17.627 --> 05:18.490
James.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.847
- I'm not
proud of having to do this.

06:40.054 --> 06:43.713
Sometimes in an isolated
moment, I almost forget.

06:45.853 --> 06:49.512
And then the rot comes and
reality comes crashing back.

06:50.755 --> 06:53.033
Six hours give or take.

06:53.067 --> 06:55.035
That's all I've got.

06:55.069 --> 06:56.346
When I was younger,

06:56.381 --> 06:58.590
I didn't have to think
about it this much.

06:58.625 --> 07:00.350
One body lasted years,

07:00.385 --> 07:02.801
I could almost pretend
life was normal.

07:02.836 --> 07:04.838
It sped up over time.

07:04.872 --> 07:06.598
Something isn't right.

07:06.633 --> 07:08.945
She should have lasted
longer than this.

07:08.980 --> 07:11.741
It's a hell of thing to
have to make this choice.

07:11.776 --> 07:14.364
When I've got time to
plan, I choose carefully.

07:14.399 --> 07:15.883
Make sure they won't be missed.

07:15.918 --> 07:18.368
When I don't have time,
I tend to order in.

07:19.646 --> 07:20.716
- You can leave the...

07:22.407 --> 07:24.513
- Good morning I'm
Detective Ransone.

07:24.547 --> 07:26.860
James was supposed to
call when you got back.

07:26.894 --> 07:27.930
When did you return?

07:27.964 --> 07:29.034
- A few days ago.

07:29.069 --> 07:32.313
- Yeah, I was just swinging
by to talk to James.

07:32.348 --> 07:34.350
He hasn't checked in
with us for a while so.

07:34.384 --> 07:35.006
Is he home?

07:35.040 --> 07:36.007
- He's not.

07:36.041 --> 07:37.733
Is there something that
I can help you with?

07:39.976 --> 07:41.771
Would you like a cup of coffee?

07:41.806 --> 07:43.704
Yes please, thank you.

07:45.982 --> 07:47.708
- Please have a seat.

07:52.989 --> 07:54.439
Make yourself comfortable.

07:55.509 --> 07:56.993
- I'll just get
right down to it.

07:57.028 --> 07:58.650
Mind telling me where you were?

08:02.102 --> 08:03.379
- Cream and sugar?

08:03.413 --> 08:04.622
- Just black, thank you.

08:20.465 --> 08:21.846
It's good.

08:21.880 --> 08:23.054
- You'll have to excuse me.

08:23.088 --> 08:25.919
Because I'm still uncomfortable
talking about this.

08:25.953 --> 08:28.542
I'm sorry to get
everyone so worried.

08:28.577 --> 08:29.439
- Not at all.

08:30.751 --> 08:32.788
I'm sorry this had to happen.

08:32.822 --> 08:34.065
I'm just glad you're okay.

08:35.066 --> 08:37.447
So where did you go?

09:12.828 --> 09:15.485
- Hi, I'm Detective
Freddie.

09:20.007 --> 09:22.734
Hi, I'm Detective Ransone.

09:24.494 --> 09:27.567
Detective Freddie
Ransone.

10:42.711 --> 10:44.644
- Delivery!

10:44.678 --> 10:45.334
Hey.

10:48.199 --> 10:49.683
Uh, hey.

10:59.969 --> 11:00.832
What the fuck man?

11:00.867 --> 11:01.971
You gotta pay for that.

11:04.733 --> 11:05.906
Hey.

11:05.941 --> 11:06.804
Hey man.

11:06.838 --> 11:07.839
Your house is on fire!

11:08.840 --> 11:11.740
Dude your house is on fire.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.192
- Ransone copy.

11:50.226 --> 11:52.608
Answer if you're there,
please confirm.

11:52.642 --> 11:55.128
- I've picked
up some tricks over time.

11:55.162 --> 11:58.821
Painkillers and antibiotics
slow the change.

11:58.856 --> 12:03.136
If I have to get out of
body faster, I need to rot.

12:03.170 --> 12:05.932
So, I have to find coke.

12:24.674 --> 12:25.883
- Oh shit Freddie.

12:25.917 --> 12:28.230
Now you gone and give me a
heart attack or something man.

12:28.264 --> 12:29.369
What do you want?

12:29.403 --> 12:30.715
Hey man, what the fuck?

12:32.130 --> 12:35.064
Yo, you have no right to
search and seizure my ass.

12:35.099 --> 12:36.652
I thought we were friends.

12:36.686 --> 12:37.342
- Shh.

12:39.655 --> 12:40.863
- This is bullshit man.

12:43.314 --> 12:44.142
That ain't mine.

12:44.177 --> 12:45.350
I'm just holding it for someone.

12:45.385 --> 12:47.801
- Hey, hey cool it.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.754
- In the
quiet moments,

13:10.790 --> 13:12.377
my thoughts always turn to her.

13:14.863 --> 13:18.280
- Max, hey it's good
to see you boy.

13:19.177 --> 13:20.420
How's it doing old timer?

13:27.323 --> 13:31.914
♪ Earthshaking to
say the least ♪

13:31.949 --> 13:37.299
♪ In the witching hour

13:37.333 --> 13:42.718

13:48.241 --> 13:50.346

13:50.381 --> 13:53.936
- Whisky rocks and a um,
gin and tonic.

13:59.804 --> 14:01.185
- For me?

14:01.219 --> 14:02.082
- Yeah.

14:03.946 --> 14:05.810
- Alright, how did you
know I drink gin and tonic?

14:05.845 --> 14:07.260
- Psychic I guess.

14:07.294 --> 14:08.468
- Oh yeah.
- Hmm-mm.

14:08.502 --> 14:09.849
- Alright.

14:11.264 --> 14:13.059
What am I thinking
about right now?

14:14.957 --> 14:16.165
- You're thinking.

14:17.511 --> 14:18.927
"Oh great,

14:18.961 --> 14:21.481
"another asshole with the
same tired pick up lines."

14:23.345 --> 14:25.416
- Well, you are good.

14:27.176 --> 14:29.799
Now what makes you more
than just another asshole?

14:30.939 --> 14:32.250
- Well, nothing.

14:33.803 --> 14:36.841
But something tells me, you're
gonna talk to me anyway.

14:38.084 --> 14:40.189
- Oh really, uh huh.

14:40.224 --> 14:41.984
And would you like to
take a bet on that?

14:42.019 --> 14:42.882
- Yes I would.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.228
- Jen witness.

14:44.262 --> 14:46.126
- Look I'm game, I'm
glad we met.

14:46.161 --> 14:47.196
- Show me your money pal.

14:47.231 --> 14:48.922
- Oh hey, we've gotta
shake on it first.

14:48.957 --> 14:50.096
- Everything okay Julia?

14:50.130 --> 14:51.476
- Yeah I'm good, fine thanks.

14:51.511 --> 14:53.202
- She's in good hands
okay.

14:54.445 --> 14:56.343
Cop, not a creep.

14:57.862 --> 14:59.105
- Cop, not a creep.

14:59.139 --> 15:00.347
Let me see this, is this real?

15:00.382 --> 15:01.245
- It is.

15:02.039 --> 15:02.902
I'm Freddie.

15:03.972 --> 15:04.869
- Julia.

15:06.077 --> 15:07.492
- But in the spirit
of disclosure,

15:07.527 --> 15:10.840
everyone calls me
Detective Ransone.

15:10.875 --> 15:11.911
- Oh Detective.

15:11.945 --> 15:12.912
- Yeah.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.810
- Well Detective, is
this an interrogation?

15:14.844 --> 15:15.949
Am I in trouble?

15:15.984 --> 15:18.400
- No, no, I'm, I am off duty.

15:18.434 --> 15:20.574
But I am trained to notice

15:20.609 --> 15:22.473
the most interesting
things in a room

15:22.507 --> 15:24.440
that others can overlook.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.445
- And is that why you
came over here?

15:29.480 --> 15:30.826
To talk to me?

15:30.860 --> 15:32.000
Because I interest you?

15:33.242 --> 15:36.487
- She's
the only one that matters.

15:36.521 --> 15:38.040
- Yeah.

15:38.075 --> 15:41.009
But um, take, take a
look around.

15:41.043 --> 15:44.115
Do you see anybody else I
ought to be talking too?

15:44.150 --> 15:45.013
- Ha.

15:46.462 --> 15:48.464
Yeah alright, I'll give
you that one.

15:48.499 --> 15:50.018
You make a good point there.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.882
- It's the first of many.

15:54.884 --> 15:57.059
- Why are you
in this crappy old bar?

15:58.267 --> 16:00.235
- Hey, it's,
it's Christmas.

16:00.269 --> 16:01.270
- It is Christmas.

16:01.305 --> 16:03.859
- Yeah where
else you supposed to go?

16:06.551 --> 16:07.414
- Really, what is?

16:07.449 --> 16:08.312
Okay, pinkies.

16:08.346 --> 16:09.589
- I can't bend this.

16:09.623 --> 16:10.624
- What?

16:10.659 --> 16:11.625
Dude that's so weird.

16:11.660 --> 16:12.523
Oh my.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.388
That's disgusting.

16:24.328 --> 16:25.156
- You okay?

16:25.191 --> 16:26.157
You alright?

16:26.192 --> 16:27.020
Oh shit.

16:27.055 --> 16:28.263
- Ooh.

16:28.297 --> 16:29.160
What?

16:32.025 --> 16:33.061
- Just, it's nothing.

16:43.519 --> 16:44.382
- Uh...

16:47.351 --> 16:48.214
- Run.

16:50.147 --> 16:51.113
- What?

16:51.148 --> 16:52.494
- Run.

16:52.528 --> 16:53.391
Run!

16:54.703 --> 16:55.566
Oh God.

16:58.189 --> 17:00.260
- My condition

17:00.295 --> 17:03.367
isn't without a few benefits.

17:03.401 --> 17:06.646
Injuries don't follow me
to the next body.

17:06.680 --> 17:08.337
- What the fuck is
happening to me?

17:08.372 --> 17:09.579
- Until now.

18:08.673 --> 18:11.607
- We're not doing
anything Officer.

18:14.369 --> 18:15.232
- Go home.

18:16.405 --> 18:18.511
You, move over.

18:23.136 --> 18:25.483
- Please, just let
me go alright.

18:25.518 --> 18:28.383
Whatever laws I've broken,
I'll pay the fines.

18:28.417 --> 18:29.246
Whatever you need...

18:29.280 --> 18:30.316
Shut up!

18:30.350 --> 18:33.491
- Look look, this is
not what it looks okay.

18:33.526 --> 18:36.770
I've got a wife and kids
and they're expecting me.

18:40.671 --> 18:42.259
Jesus.

18:42.293 --> 18:44.778
- If I don't do this, I'll die.

18:50.267 --> 18:51.647
And I'm not ready to die.

18:55.237 --> 18:58.551
Which means, you'll have to.

19:06.593 --> 19:07.456
I'm sorry.

19:44.493 --> 19:46.426
People who
live in a house like this,

19:46.461 --> 19:48.739
tend to stay there
for a lifetime.

19:48.773 --> 19:51.811
Roots dug deep,
fearing any change.

19:51.845 --> 19:53.537
Suffocating in comfort.

19:54.572 --> 19:57.161
It doesn't stop some
perverse instinct in me

19:57.196 --> 19:59.094
from wanting this too.

19:59.128 --> 20:01.234
It's only nature I think.

20:01.269 --> 20:02.304
The pull of the pack.

21:24.213 --> 21:25.594
- Daddy, Daddy wake up.

21:25.629 --> 21:27.286
- Get the fuck off me.

21:28.459 --> 21:31.462
- Mummy, Mummy, Dad
said a bad word!

21:33.257 --> 21:34.845
- After school can
I go to Chris's house?

21:34.879 --> 21:37.296
- As long as you've
done your homework in time.

21:37.330 --> 21:39.505
- Okay.
- You know the rules.

21:39.539 --> 21:42.404
Sit, join the kids
for breakfast.

21:43.440 --> 21:44.786
- Daddy,
what's wrong?

21:44.820 --> 21:47.582
- Nothing, nothing sweetie.

21:47.616 --> 21:52.483
I can't stay, I'm gonna
be late for work.

21:52.518 --> 21:53.657
- Bye Daddy.

22:02.493 --> 22:05.496
- Sam no, you're drunk.

22:05.531 --> 22:10.329
You're my boss and my
friend, but nothing more.

22:13.504 --> 22:15.713
Oh good morning Dr. Richardson.

22:15.748 --> 22:16.921
- And how are you today?

22:18.302 --> 22:19.752
- I'm good.

22:19.786 --> 22:20.753
How are you?

22:20.787 --> 22:22.375
Everything okay?

22:22.410 --> 22:23.514
- Never better.

22:23.549 --> 22:24.791
- Okay then.

22:24.826 --> 22:28.588
Your first patients already
waiting for you in room three.

22:29.727 --> 22:30.970
- Tim is it?

22:31.004 --> 22:36.009
I'm Dr. Richardson, how
are you today Tim, huh?

23:07.903 --> 23:09.733
Let's make you nice
and comfortable.

23:10.734 --> 23:11.597
You just relax.

23:24.092 --> 23:25.714
Don't you worry Tim.

23:28.579 --> 23:31.030
This isn't the first
time I've been a dentist.

23:37.933 --> 23:39.418
All fixed.

23:40.488 --> 23:42.524
He may have some lingering
pain for a few days,

23:42.559 --> 23:44.733
but soon enough he'll be
right as rain.

23:44.768 --> 23:45.907
- Thank you.

23:45.941 --> 23:47.667
- I can
only keep up their routine

23:47.702 --> 23:51.326
for so long, it
drains the spirit.

23:51.360 --> 23:52.431
I need breaks.

24:08.964 --> 24:09.827
- Just drive.

24:11.519 --> 24:12.796
Follow that silver car.

24:12.830 --> 24:13.831
- I'm sorry where?

24:13.866 --> 24:15.971
- Follow the silver car already.

24:16.006 --> 24:18.318
- Oh you want me to
follow that woman's car?

24:18.353 --> 24:19.630
Yeah I'm not gonna do that.

24:20.700 --> 24:22.012
It's suspicious as hell man.

24:24.670 --> 24:25.602
- Never mind.

24:25.636 --> 24:26.879
I've
been trying to figure out

24:26.913 --> 24:28.984
her new address for
almost a year.

24:35.543 --> 24:38.097
Movies have always been
a big part of my life.

24:38.131 --> 24:40.962
Something about being in
that dark room,

24:40.996 --> 24:43.033
is such a healing experience.

24:43.067 --> 24:45.656
It's get me out of head,
helps quiet the voices.

24:45.691 --> 24:47.071
- Can you shut the fuck up?

25:20.691 --> 25:23.487
- Why do seagulls
live near the sea?

25:23.522 --> 25:25.144
- 'Cause that's where
they get fish?

25:25.178 --> 25:27.560
- No, 'cause if
they live near the bay

25:27.595 --> 25:28.837
they'd be bagels.

25:28.872 --> 25:30.390
- That's a good one.

25:30.425 --> 25:31.806
- So bad.

25:34.533 --> 25:35.982
- Okay, you go
ahead honey.

25:36.017 --> 25:38.813
- He turned into a
monkey and then...

25:38.847 --> 25:40.677
- And then what?

25:40.711 --> 25:43.749
- It ate all
the cookies in the world.

25:43.783 --> 25:45.682
- Oh my goodness.

26:00.766 --> 26:03.078
- I've really
only got one tangible thing

26:03.113 --> 26:05.564
left from my true family.

26:05.598 --> 26:07.531
Only one constant.

26:08.636 --> 26:09.844
The rest is memory.

26:22.235 --> 26:25.722
- I saw you here last
night right?

26:25.756 --> 26:30.071
You were with a younger
girl I think.

26:32.625 --> 26:33.592
- Yeah.

26:35.248 --> 26:37.596
I don't know what I
was thinking.

26:40.219 --> 26:43.153
- Oh, I take it that she
wasn't your wife.

26:43.187 --> 26:46.605
- No, a momentary lapse
of judgment I'd call it.

26:47.675 --> 26:49.573
Don't plan to make that
mistake again.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.820
I was, getting away
from my family.

26:56.131 --> 26:58.168
Sometimes I just need an escape,
you know.

26:58.202 --> 27:00.584
- Where are you going?

27:00.619 --> 27:01.861
Sam!

27:01.896 --> 27:05.658
- Yeah, I used to
think like that.

27:05.693 --> 27:10.145
But, I never really
realized how wrong that was.

27:10.180 --> 27:11.077
- Huh?

27:11.112 --> 27:14.080
- You love them right?

27:16.151 --> 27:19.845
- Yeah, yes I love them.

27:20.949 --> 27:23.918
- Then make sure that you
always go back to them.

27:23.952 --> 27:26.299
That is all that matters.

27:31.132 --> 27:33.859
I had a little boy
and a husband.

27:35.101 --> 27:38.933
And I felt the same way that
you do, more often than not.

27:40.244 --> 27:41.694
But now if I could go back

27:41.729 --> 27:43.938
I would spend all of the
time that I could with them

27:43.972 --> 27:45.111
because it is fleeting.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.047
- What happened?

27:50.082 --> 27:54.051
- Hmm, no you don't wanna
hear that story.

27:55.190 --> 27:56.916
It's not a happy one.

27:56.951 --> 27:58.642
- It's not a happy night.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.092
It's not even happy hour.

28:00.126 --> 28:04.061
- Well, my little boy, Taylor...

28:08.859 --> 28:09.722
He died.

28:11.586 --> 28:12.932
A few years ago.

28:12.967 --> 28:18.041
There was complications
with pertussis, he was,

28:18.075 --> 28:19.180
that's whooping cough.

28:20.906 --> 28:22.355
He was only three.

28:25.151 --> 28:26.359
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28:31.226 --> 28:35.230
- Yeah I've come to terms
with it, the best that I can.

28:39.890 --> 28:40.926
Sorry.

28:43.791 --> 28:44.999
Anyway he passed away.

28:48.278 --> 28:50.590
And it was just
Richard and I.

28:50.625 --> 28:52.282
That's my husband, and I.

28:52.316 --> 28:53.179
And...

28:55.872 --> 28:58.081
It was really fucking hard.

28:59.772 --> 29:01.325
It changed things.

29:01.360 --> 29:03.362
And this one night I came home

29:03.396 --> 29:07.642
and Richard had set up
the table for dinner.

29:07.676 --> 29:09.195
And he'd lit these candles

29:09.230 --> 29:10.852
and made it romantic

29:10.887 --> 29:14.373
and he said that he
wanted us to forget.

29:14.407 --> 29:17.756
Even if it was just for
that one night.

29:19.827 --> 29:20.689
And so we did.

29:22.899 --> 29:25.315
We ate and we laughed.

29:26.316 --> 29:27.317
We made love.

29:30.699 --> 29:35.014
And it felt like it was the
first time all over again.

29:35.049 --> 29:36.844
And then I woke up in
the middle of the night

29:36.878 --> 29:37.914
and he was gone.

29:39.087 --> 29:40.088
He was just gone.

29:41.262 --> 29:42.815
There was no trace.

29:42.850 --> 29:44.196
It was like he just vanished.

29:47.164 --> 29:48.821
Oh.

29:48.856 --> 29:51.065
I think that it was all
just too much for him

29:51.099 --> 29:52.480
and he had to leave.

29:53.895 --> 29:54.965
And I think that that night

29:55.000 --> 29:57.692
was his proper way of
saying goodbye.

30:04.941 --> 30:07.081
- Can I, can I buy
your next drink?

30:08.737 --> 30:09.359
- Yes.

30:09.393 --> 30:10.256
- Yeah.

30:11.913 --> 30:12.811
- Thanks.

30:15.365 --> 30:16.228
- Hmm.

30:20.508 --> 30:22.130
- So what about you?

30:24.339 --> 30:25.824
Why the need to escape?

30:27.722 --> 30:28.378
- I'm afraid.

30:31.484 --> 30:32.416
I'm afraid.

30:37.076 --> 30:41.218
I really don't know, what
I'd, what I'd do if I stayed.

30:44.256 --> 30:48.294
Sometimes I um, I wonder if,
what's best for them you know.

30:52.989 --> 30:54.369
- Do you consider
yourself a good person?

30:54.404 --> 30:57.407
- I'm not even
sure I'd consider myself a person.

30:57.441 --> 31:02.861
The real question is does
being good really matter?

31:02.895 --> 31:04.793
I mean really matter.

31:05.933 --> 31:08.452
Bad things happen to good
people all the time right?

31:12.077 --> 31:12.974
- Yeah.

31:13.009 --> 31:13.872
They do.

31:15.183 --> 31:16.391
But you know what I think

31:17.496 --> 31:20.223
that the important thing
is to make sure that

31:20.257 --> 31:22.052
you are not the bad
thing yourself.

32:03.852 --> 32:05.854
- The
coke may serve a function,

32:05.889 --> 32:07.132
but it's still coke.

32:08.064 --> 32:09.858
It does what coke does.

32:12.068 --> 32:14.449
You take it when you
wanna escape yourself.

32:39.612 --> 32:40.475
What?

33:10.195 --> 33:11.990
- Sam?

33:12.024 --> 33:13.267
It's really late, what's up?

33:13.301 --> 33:16.132
- I really need
someone to talk too.

33:16.166 --> 33:18.030
I didn't know who else to call.

33:18.065 --> 33:19.583
- What's
going on with you?

33:19.618 --> 33:21.516
Last night was bad enough,
but you left the office today

33:21.551 --> 33:22.655
without a saying a word.

33:22.690 --> 33:25.934
We had to reschedule half
a dozen appointments.

33:25.969 --> 33:27.660
Are you in some kind of trouble?

33:27.695 --> 33:29.662
- No, no, it's
nothing like that.

33:31.319 --> 33:33.977
I had, I had a really bad
night with Mary.

33:35.323 --> 33:38.016
And she kicked me out.

33:38.050 --> 33:41.950
- Oh Sam, I'm
sorry to hear that.

33:41.985 --> 33:44.194
- Do you, can you come see me?

33:45.161 --> 33:47.335
I don't wanna be
alone right now.

33:47.370 --> 33:50.166
- Jesus Sam, seriously?

33:50.200 --> 33:52.064
- I'm really sorry
about last night.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.377
I, I made a mistake.

33:55.378 --> 33:57.656
I promise I won't try
anything like that again.

33:59.382 --> 34:02.212
I just, I really need a
friend right now.

34:04.249 --> 34:05.112
Please.

34:06.596 --> 34:08.114
- Alright.

34:08.149 --> 34:10.600
Tommy's already passed out
here so I'll drive over.

34:14.121 --> 34:16.088
- You're still with him?

34:16.123 --> 34:17.710
- Yeah, you know that.

34:19.228 --> 34:20.092
Address?

34:23.543 --> 34:25.097
- Do you have a pen?

34:45.462 --> 34:46.601
It's unlocked.

34:48.465 --> 34:49.570
- Before I come in,

34:49.603 --> 34:52.331
I just wanna say I'm not
super comfortable with this.

34:53.539 --> 34:54.540
We're friends and all

34:54.574 --> 34:56.438
but this is pretty
fucking above and beyond.

34:56.473 --> 34:59.476
Coming to a motel in
the middle of the night.

34:59.511 --> 35:02.100
You try anything and I am
out the door, you got that?

35:02.134 --> 35:02.790
- Got it.

35:04.240 --> 35:06.069
- Also, I wanna talk
about a raise.

35:12.696 --> 35:14.146
Why's the room so dark?

35:16.700 --> 35:18.426
Where the hell is light switch?

35:18.461 --> 35:19.427
- Come here Rachel.

35:21.188 --> 35:22.050
- Sam?

35:23.811 --> 35:25.053
Are you okay?

35:28.678 --> 35:32.371
Oh Sam, it looks like you've
overdone it a bit yeah?

35:45.626 --> 35:46.489
Sam?

35:54.842 --> 35:57.672
- That
hurt a lot more than usual.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.330
It feels like I'm dying.

36:24.251 --> 36:26.114
That's not gonna cut it.

36:26.149 --> 36:29.117
She probably has access
to antibiotics.

36:38.265 --> 36:39.473
- Hi Tommy.

36:39.507 --> 36:40.577
- Where'd you go?

36:40.612 --> 36:43.201
It's the middle of the night.

36:43.235 --> 36:44.443
- I felt a migraine coming on.

36:44.478 --> 36:48.102
I ran out to all night
pharmacy, be back soon okay.

36:48.136 --> 36:50.380
- Uh huh, can you
pick me up some smokes?

36:50.415 --> 36:53.245
- I'm already on my way back,
sorry.

36:54.419 --> 36:55.351
See you soon okay?

37:30.558 --> 37:32.284
- Is that you Frank?

37:33.872 --> 37:36.254
I haven't seen you around
much these days.

37:37.462 --> 37:40.292
Been seeing the smoke though.

37:40.327 --> 37:41.362
What you burning?

37:42.432 --> 37:44.227
Something smells kind of weird.

37:55.445 --> 37:56.860
It's just Colleen.

37:56.895 --> 37:58.621
Is that your car
parked out here?

38:08.941 --> 38:09.804
Hey.

38:12.876 --> 38:15.914
Hey, hello.

38:15.948 --> 38:18.330
Are you Frank's granddaughter?

38:32.482 --> 38:33.345
- Damn it.

38:54.332 --> 38:55.022
Tommy?

38:57.576 --> 39:00.338
- Lucky
break, he's gone home.

39:43.484 --> 39:44.692
- Hi.

39:44.727 --> 39:46.936
Hey buddy, how's it going?

39:52.355 --> 39:53.011
Wait.

40:08.751 --> 40:09.993
- Whisky on the rocks.

40:11.616 --> 40:14.929
- Oh boy, someone is
looking for trouble tonight?

40:14.964 --> 40:16.690
- It that obvious?

40:16.724 --> 40:18.381
- Well that dress and this bar,

40:18.416 --> 40:20.659
it, it really
doesn't take a PHD.

40:20.694 --> 40:21.971
You look great but...

40:22.005 --> 40:23.490
- Thanks, just killing time.

40:23.524 --> 40:25.008
- Well, you've come to
the right place

40:25.043 --> 40:27.873
because this is where
time comes to die.

40:30.428 --> 40:31.843
- What brings you here tonight?

40:32.913 --> 40:35.398
- Um, I'm here most nights,
right Jen.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.503
- Ah.

40:36.537 --> 40:39.678
- I can't, I can't get
much writing done at home.

40:39.713 --> 40:41.680
The silence just drives me mad.

40:41.715 --> 40:43.682
- You a writer?

40:43.717 --> 40:47.893
- Um, wouldn't go that far but,

40:47.928 --> 40:52.933
I just, I like it and it
helps me sort things out.

40:54.106 --> 40:55.522
- What are you working on?

40:56.419 --> 40:57.075
- A book.

40:58.145 --> 40:59.560
Yeah, I know.

40:59.595 --> 41:00.665
- That's impressive.

41:00.699 --> 41:01.942
How soon 'til it's finished?

41:01.976 --> 41:03.633
- I have absolutely no clue.

41:03.668 --> 41:04.945
It will be,

41:04.979 --> 41:07.810
it will be finished when it
feels finished, you know.

41:07.844 --> 41:08.742
My...

41:10.398 --> 41:12.746
My therapist suggested that
I write down my thoughts.

41:12.780 --> 41:14.575
To help me cope.

41:14.610 --> 41:17.475
And it just got way out of hand,
I guess.

41:19.511 --> 41:20.788
Hey I'm Julia by the way.

41:22.169 --> 41:23.066
- Drew.

41:23.101 --> 41:24.620
- Very nice to meet you.

41:24.654 --> 41:25.586
- Nice to meet you.

41:25.621 --> 41:27.519
- Did I see you here
the other night?

41:27.554 --> 41:31.040
I think with a, an older
gentleman, sort of.

41:31.074 --> 41:32.559
- Oh.

41:32.593 --> 41:34.353
Yeah, you've got a good memory.

41:34.388 --> 41:36.666
- Yes I do, me and elephants.

41:36.701 --> 41:37.771
- Hmm.

41:39.013 --> 41:42.603
- No, it's just this place,
it never seems to change,

41:42.638 --> 41:44.018
just the people do.

41:44.053 --> 41:45.537
So, I'm here a lot

41:45.572 --> 41:48.954
and I tend to notice the
faces that stand out.

41:48.989 --> 41:51.060
- Yeah I like that
about this place.

41:51.094 --> 41:51.923
- What's that?

41:52.924 --> 41:54.650
- There's a lot to be said
for consistency

41:54.684 --> 41:57.031
when you don't have it
anywhere else in your life.

41:58.585 --> 42:02.174
- Yes, yes A-fucking-
men to that.

42:02.209 --> 42:03.106
Cheers.

42:03.141 --> 42:04.004
- Cheers.

42:05.212 --> 42:06.075
- Cheers.

42:07.870 --> 42:08.905
- Hmm, decades have passed

42:08.940 --> 42:10.148
and this place has
stayed the same.

42:10.182 --> 42:11.805
I remember back in
the 70's when...

42:11.839 --> 42:13.531
- Wait, hold on, I'm sorry.

42:13.565 --> 42:14.980
Did you, 70's?

42:15.015 --> 42:17.914
You're like 20.

42:17.949 --> 42:19.985
- Consider me an old soul then.

42:25.819 --> 42:27.752
- You know you have sad eyes?

42:27.786 --> 42:28.994
- What?

42:29.029 --> 42:32.791
- Hmm-mm, yeah you
have sad eyes.

42:32.826 --> 42:35.622
I can tell you are not here
for a good time tonight.

42:36.968 --> 42:39.108
I don't know what it is but,

42:39.142 --> 42:41.800
yeah you're not here
for a good time.

42:41.835 --> 42:42.698
Hmm.

42:43.733 --> 42:44.596
You know what?

42:45.839 --> 42:46.874
Here.

42:46.909 --> 42:51.741
I am going to give you a card,
here.

42:52.673 --> 42:54.848
The address to my office.

42:54.882 --> 42:57.954
Sorry, I'm a counselor.

42:57.989 --> 43:00.060
The address to my
office is on there.

43:00.094 --> 43:05.168
And if you ever need anybody
to talk to, about anything,

43:05.203 --> 43:07.895
after tonight, just give
me a call okay?

43:09.759 --> 43:10.795
- Thank you.

43:10.829 --> 43:14.039
- Hmm-mm, she knows I'm
not creepy or anything.

43:15.731 --> 43:17.008
- Can I buy you a drink?

43:17.042 --> 43:18.803
- Hmm, hello.
- Um.

43:18.837 --> 43:21.046
- Yes, you can, yes you can.

43:21.081 --> 43:23.773
That is my queue to leave,
I'm leaving.

43:23.808 --> 43:25.879
Please, you can have my seat.

43:25.913 --> 43:28.744
Hey, have some fun.

43:28.778 --> 43:29.814
- Alright.

43:29.848 --> 43:31.539
- Jen can I grab another please?

43:32.817 --> 43:33.680
Whoops.

43:36.683 --> 43:39.133
- So, drink?

43:41.722 --> 43:43.655
- Sure, whisky rocks.

43:45.692 --> 43:46.589
Thanks.

43:48.108 --> 43:50.973
- That's funny you ordered
a whisky on the rocks,

43:51.007 --> 43:53.561
that was my old football
coaches favorite drink.

43:54.908 --> 43:56.323
On the off season and the on.

43:57.565 --> 43:58.670
You like football?

43:58.705 --> 43:59.533
- No.

43:59.567 --> 44:00.845
- I loved it.

44:00.879 --> 44:03.986
Fucking varsity football, 2007.

44:05.712 --> 44:06.782
Am I boring you?

44:06.816 --> 44:07.714
- Not at all.

44:07.748 --> 44:09.888
- Okay so, as I was saying.

44:09.923 --> 44:12.063
Getting down there,
the 15 yard line, boom,

44:12.097 --> 44:13.098
I get it sweep right.

44:13.133 --> 44:14.997
- What
the fucks this asshole

44:15.031 --> 44:15.860
even talking about?

44:15.894 --> 44:18.241
What a douche bag.

44:23.868 --> 44:26.629
- Our 15 yard line and it's all.

44:28.735 --> 44:30.875
I flip inside, I fell.

44:35.603 --> 44:38.710
You know 15 yard line
on their side.

44:38.745 --> 44:39.815
Big tackle.

44:39.849 --> 44:42.024
- Maybe
he'll be some use after all.

44:42.058 --> 44:44.854
- I just need to run to the
bathroom, be back in a minute.

44:59.179 --> 45:00.663
You wanna get out of here?

45:04.184 --> 45:05.323
♪ I'm tired of existence

45:05.357 --> 45:07.014

45:27.759 --> 45:30.141
I'll admit it, sometimes
I've even enjoyed it.

45:30.175 --> 45:31.314
- What's, what's wrong?

45:31.349 --> 45:32.246
What is it?

45:32.281 --> 45:34.007
- Sometimes.

45:34.041 --> 45:35.180
- It's nothing.

45:35.215 --> 45:36.112
- Okay.

45:39.702 --> 45:40.358
- Um.

45:40.392 --> 45:42.394
Do you want some coke?

45:43.671 --> 45:44.880
- Thought you'd never ask.

45:46.191 --> 45:47.745
Fucking bring it.

46:32.755 --> 46:33.929
- Can we slow down a bit?

46:35.033 --> 46:37.795
- You want this as much as I do.

46:38.934 --> 46:39.797
- Please.

46:40.728 --> 46:42.351
- Don't be such a
fucking cock tease.

46:50.048 --> 46:51.809
- Get off of me!

48:59.281 --> 49:02.008
- Help, someone call the police.

49:14.572 --> 49:17.402
Don't worry, the police
are on their way.

49:18.334 --> 49:19.542
I've just called them.

50:45.456 --> 50:47.527
Most
of the cops in this city

50:47.561 --> 50:51.117
couldn't find a needle
in a bucket of needles.

50:51.151 --> 50:52.566
You be enough of them,

50:52.601 --> 50:55.328
you realize it's best to
just stay put.

51:58.425 --> 52:00.772
- Rachel, I
know you're here!

52:00.807 --> 52:01.635
Rachel!

52:01.670 --> 52:03.189
- How did you know where I was?

52:03.223 --> 52:04.776
- A rule
to keep me breathing.

52:04.811 --> 52:07.089
The boyfriend of a
murder suspect

52:07.124 --> 52:09.574
is not an ideal form to take.

52:09.609 --> 52:10.679
His lucky day.

52:21.828 --> 52:22.691
- Rachel!

52:39.294 --> 52:40.157
Rachel!

53:11.843 --> 53:14.501
- I'm kidding
myself if I keep this up.

53:14.536 --> 53:17.815
If I'm running out of time,
I should face the facts.

53:17.849 --> 53:22.095
The right thing to do is tell
her truth, be done with it.

53:48.846 --> 53:49.709
Damn it.

55:26.288 --> 55:27.393
- Who is it?

55:27.427 --> 55:28.980
- Delivery.

55:44.341 --> 55:45.618
- I just wanted to call

55:45.652 --> 55:47.827
and say I had a great time
today at lunch.

55:47.861 --> 55:49.932
I hope this doesn't sound
too forward but,

55:51.382 --> 55:53.660
I can't stop thinking about you.

55:57.802 --> 55:58.872
Hello.

55:58.907 --> 56:00.805
- Yeah, yeah I'm,
I'm here.

56:02.669 --> 56:05.845
And I'm flattered Robert.

56:05.879 --> 56:06.811
Really I am.

56:07.847 --> 56:10.919
- Okay just, give me
one second here please.

56:15.510 --> 56:16.373
I like you.

56:17.684 --> 56:18.547
A lot.

56:19.583 --> 56:20.894
And I wanna see you again.

56:20.929 --> 56:24.381
Someplace where the two
of us can just be alone.

56:27.901 --> 56:29.765
- Okay.

56:29.800 --> 56:31.388
- Okay?

56:31.422 --> 56:32.389
- Yeah okay.

56:34.598 --> 56:36.047
Your place or mine?

56:40.397 --> 56:42.571
- Let's make it your place.

56:44.987 --> 56:48.059
- So yeah, this is my place.

56:48.094 --> 56:50.337
I know it's kind of basic.

56:50.372 --> 56:52.616
I just, I don't know,

56:52.650 --> 56:56.654
I lost the taste for caring
about design I guess.

56:56.689 --> 57:01.452
Um, I'm just gonna put
on some music.

57:01.487 --> 57:03.040
You wanna do the
honors with that?

57:04.110 --> 57:05.905
- Yeah sure.

57:36.522 --> 57:37.454
- Oh nicely done.

57:38.662 --> 57:40.767
- I used to be a server.

57:41.734 --> 57:42.735
In a past life.

57:42.769 --> 57:44.702
- Well color me impressed.

57:46.877 --> 57:47.740
Cheers.

57:49.431 --> 57:50.536
- What do we cheers to?

57:52.469 --> 57:53.124
I got it.

57:54.540 --> 57:56.645
To, possibilities.

57:58.509 --> 57:59.545
- All there ever is.

58:01.961 --> 58:03.687
- Cheers.

58:07.069 --> 58:10.832
- There's just something
familiar about you.

58:14.663 --> 58:16.838
I don't know what it is but...

58:16.872 --> 58:19.599
- I think when two people
have a connection like,

58:22.084 --> 58:23.016
a real connection.

58:24.535 --> 58:29.816
There's this, familiarity
and there's this comfort

58:29.851 --> 58:30.886
that drives it.

58:34.925 --> 58:36.443
- Is that you think we have?

58:38.445 --> 58:39.101
A connection?

58:41.828 --> 58:42.864
- No, I think.

58:46.592 --> 58:48.594
I think we're kindred
spirits you and I.

58:49.940 --> 58:50.803
- Oh.

58:51.942 --> 58:53.081
- Yeah.

58:53.978 --> 58:56.049
I heard it when I said it.

58:56.084 --> 58:56.947
- Uh huh.

58:56.981 --> 58:58.604
- That was terrible, I'm sorry.

59:00.053 --> 59:03.540
- Alright, and what would,

59:05.956 --> 59:09.166
what would two people
such as ourselves want

59:10.616 --> 59:11.478
in this moment?

59:25.147 --> 59:26.217
- To connect.

59:29.807 --> 59:33.604
♪ Pick me apart now

59:33.639 --> 59:37.677
♪ Find someone else to blame

59:37.712 --> 59:41.508
♪ Wallow in shame

59:41.543 --> 59:46.824
♪ Until it's gone

59:46.859 --> 59:50.587
♪ Time where have you gone now

59:58.733 --> 59:59.596
- Oh jeez.

01:00:03.254 --> 01:00:04.635
What happened?

01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:06.775
- I cut myself, it's okay.

01:00:06.810 --> 01:00:07.776
- On what?

01:00:08.846 --> 01:00:10.607
- I walked into a nail,
I'm fine.

01:00:11.677 --> 01:00:12.781
- You walked into a nail?

01:00:12.816 --> 01:00:14.818
- I walked into a nail.

01:00:14.852 --> 01:00:16.060
- Are you okay?

01:00:17.165 --> 01:00:18.304
- I'm perfect.

01:01:37.314 --> 01:01:38.280
- It's burning.

01:01:42.077 --> 01:01:43.285
- It's kind of my thing.

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:45.287
It's a bit of a delicacy.

01:01:45.322 --> 01:01:46.979
- Making breakfast?

01:01:47.013 --> 01:01:50.085
- Yeah, I hope you don't mind.

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:53.606
I was kind of under
the impression

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:55.884
you don't get treated too often.

01:01:55.919 --> 01:01:56.782
I wanna change that.

01:01:57.783 --> 01:01:59.163
- You are very sweet.

01:02:00.751 --> 01:02:03.305
- I used to
hate being alone at Christmas.

01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:05.756
Then I just hated being alone.

01:02:05.791 --> 01:02:07.344
Eventually I realized,

01:02:07.378 --> 01:02:08.897
at least as far as people go,

01:02:08.932 --> 01:02:12.004
quality is far better
than quantity.

01:02:12.038 --> 01:02:12.901
Every time.

01:03:08.439 --> 01:03:11.132
I had a dog when I was kid.

01:03:11.166 --> 01:03:13.134
I loved him with all my heart.

01:03:13.168 --> 01:03:15.205
When he died my mother told me

01:03:15.239 --> 01:03:16.378
that was how things are.

01:03:16.413 --> 01:03:18.242
That everything ends.

01:03:18.277 --> 01:03:19.381
Nothing's permanent.

01:03:19.416 --> 01:03:21.211
As much as you want it to be.

01:03:21.245 --> 01:03:22.937
I didn't wanna believe
it at the time

01:03:22.971 --> 01:03:25.732
but age showed me just
how right she was.

01:03:25.767 --> 01:03:27.734
The moments are what matter.

01:03:27.769 --> 01:03:29.081
And they're fleeting.

01:03:29.115 --> 01:03:31.290
- More developments
in the grizzly discovery

01:03:31.324 --> 01:03:33.844
of what is being called
the Farm of Death.

01:03:33.879 --> 01:03:35.881
As the remains of
dozens of victims

01:03:35.915 --> 01:03:37.468
have been recovered so far.

01:03:37.503 --> 01:03:40.817
As of yet, only six victims
have been identified.

01:03:40.851 --> 01:03:42.888
While the search for
previous person of interest

01:03:42.922 --> 01:03:44.441
Rachel Martin has
been called off

01:03:44.475 --> 01:03:48.307
when investigators found
her remains among the dead.

01:03:48.341 --> 01:03:50.930
The remains were discovered
- Hey hey.

01:03:50.965 --> 01:03:52.759
- When local
resident Pauline Baker

01:03:52.794 --> 01:03:54.209
- What are you doing?
- Noticed suspicious activity.

01:03:54.244 --> 01:03:55.383
- Why are you
watching this stuff?

01:03:55.417 --> 01:03:57.005
There's not enough bad
in the world,

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.869
you gotta watch these hacks

01:03:58.904 --> 01:04:01.423
sensationalize
peoples tragedies?

01:04:01.458 --> 01:04:03.011
- It's just so close to here.

01:04:04.392 --> 01:04:07.360
- Yeah, but I mean when
they put on TV like this.

01:04:07.395 --> 01:04:08.879
Then they, you know,

01:04:08.914 --> 01:04:11.261
they make it sound like
it's a million mile away,

01:04:11.295 --> 01:04:12.296
like a movie or something.

01:04:12.331 --> 01:04:14.885
- No, not this time.

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.887
I recognize some of those people

01:04:16.922 --> 01:04:17.750
that they've identified.

01:04:17.784 --> 01:04:20.408
I've spoken with
them in the bar.

01:04:22.306 --> 01:04:23.376
- Okay well.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.415
Hey, you know what.

01:04:27.449 --> 01:04:31.108
I think I'd rather just
concentrate on the here and now.

01:04:32.938 --> 01:04:34.801
That's what's important right?

01:04:34.836 --> 01:04:35.492
- Hmm-mm.

01:04:39.047 --> 01:04:40.117
Just so scary.

01:04:48.954 --> 01:04:50.990
- I won't let anything
bad happen to you.

01:04:51.957 --> 01:04:52.854
I promise.

01:05:21.572 --> 01:05:23.954
- You think the
traffic will be bad?

01:05:23.989 --> 01:05:25.162
- I don't know.

01:05:25.197 --> 01:05:26.301
This city's so small,

01:05:26.336 --> 01:05:28.510
it can't even handle the
population it has now.

01:05:28.545 --> 01:05:30.409
- Okay, well I should
be ready soon,

01:05:30.443 --> 01:05:31.513
I think we'll be fine.

01:05:54.467 --> 01:05:55.917
Are you okay in there?

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.202
Robert?

01:06:06.203 --> 01:06:07.032
- I'm fine.

01:06:07.066 --> 01:06:07.964
I'm fine.

01:06:09.172 --> 01:06:11.208
I'll be out in a second.

01:06:30.952 --> 01:06:32.229
- Feeling okay?

01:06:32.264 --> 01:06:33.127
- Yeah.

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:36.475
- Don't, don't, don't touch me.

01:06:36.509 --> 01:06:37.338
- Why?

01:06:37.372 --> 01:06:38.235
Are you okay?

01:06:39.271 --> 01:06:40.237
- Do you trust me?

01:06:40.272 --> 01:06:41.549
- Yes.

01:06:41.583 --> 01:06:42.515
Of course I do.

01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:44.966
- There's something I
need to tell you.

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:46.071
You should probably sit down,

01:06:46.105 --> 01:06:47.175
it's gonna make it easier.

01:06:48.073 --> 01:06:49.039
- What are you talking about?

01:06:49.074 --> 01:06:50.213
You're scaring me.

01:06:50.247 --> 01:06:53.388
- Alright please just, please
can you do this for me?

01:06:53.423 --> 01:06:56.598
Can you just, go and sit down.

01:07:16.446 --> 01:07:17.343
- Well?

01:07:19.345 --> 01:07:20.243
Okay, what is it?

01:07:25.282 --> 01:07:26.145
- Okay.

01:07:30.977 --> 01:07:34.705
You're the only person
I've ever told this too.

01:07:39.331 --> 01:07:41.195
When I was 12 years old,

01:07:42.575 --> 01:07:45.371
I was responsible for my
mother's death.

01:07:45.406 --> 01:07:47.546
I was, I was young.

01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:49.962
I didn't know what it
was at the time.

01:07:51.205 --> 01:07:54.691
But, I mean, it was an accident.

01:07:54.725 --> 01:07:56.175
- So you feel responsible?

01:07:57.694 --> 01:08:02.043
Hey, that was a long time ago.

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:04.114
- Yeah.

01:08:04.149 --> 01:08:05.046
Yeah.

01:08:06.599 --> 01:08:08.084
It was 1954.

01:08:10.465 --> 01:08:11.328
- What?

01:08:14.435 --> 01:08:16.161
- I'm a lot older than I look.

01:08:17.506 --> 01:08:21.511
- You're not, wait you're not
making any sense right now.

01:08:21.545 --> 01:08:22.511
- I know, I know.

01:08:25.446 --> 01:08:30.175
When, when I took her,
my mother.

01:08:33.488 --> 01:08:34.627
I saw.

01:08:35.490 --> 01:08:37.389
No, that's not right.

01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:40.633
I felt.

01:08:43.256 --> 01:08:44.120
I remembered.

01:08:45.707 --> 01:08:48.331
I remembered the way she loved.

01:08:48.365 --> 01:08:53.162
This love that was just so pure.

01:08:53.198 --> 01:08:56.477
I never felt anything like
that in my entire life

01:08:56.511 --> 01:08:57.823
and I never did again.

01:08:59.444 --> 01:09:03.139
Until, until a couple
of years ago.

01:09:05.589 --> 01:09:06.520
Yeah um.

01:09:12.216 --> 01:09:13.149
I take people.

01:09:14.357 --> 01:09:15.461
That's what I am.

01:09:15.496 --> 01:09:16.359
It's...

01:09:17.497 --> 01:09:20.432
I become somebody else.

01:09:20.466 --> 01:09:24.814
There's this change that
happens inside of me

01:09:24.850 --> 01:09:29.786
and if I don't find somebody
in time, it'll kill me.

01:09:29.819 --> 01:09:30.787
I know it will.

01:09:30.821 --> 01:09:32.202
It will kill me.

01:09:32.237 --> 01:09:34.411
- What do you mean take?

01:09:35.618 --> 01:09:37.725
What do you take?

01:09:37.759 --> 01:09:39.175
- Everything.

01:09:39.209 --> 01:09:44.352
Their voice, their shape,
their look, their memories.

01:09:44.386 --> 01:09:45.663
Their hopes and dreams,

01:09:45.698 --> 01:09:51.152
everything that makes somebody
who they are, I take it.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:52.533
And I keep it, for good.

01:09:53.879 --> 01:09:56.157
They're all, all up here.

01:09:58.677 --> 01:10:03.129
- You are really not
making any sense right now.

01:10:03.164 --> 01:10:07.341
Why are you saying all of
this weird shit?

01:10:07.375 --> 01:10:10.171
- I know, I know, I know
it sounds like weird shit,

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:12.863
but it's the truth, I swear
to God Julia, it's the truth.

01:10:22.425 --> 01:10:23.874
- I'm gonna go home.

01:10:26.291 --> 01:10:27.188
- Wait.

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:34.747
- I really thought I'd
finally found somebody normal.

01:10:34.782 --> 01:10:36.301
So thank you for this.

01:10:36.335 --> 01:10:38.613
- Okay wait, I haven't even
told you the whole story yet.

01:10:38.648 --> 01:10:39.856
Please just wait.

01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:41.237
- I don't wanna hear it.

01:10:41.271 --> 01:10:42.583
- Okay, just wait.
- Don't wanna hear it.

01:10:42.617 --> 01:10:44.826
I got my own shit to deal
with, I can't deal with this.

01:10:44.861 --> 01:10:47.691
- I've known you a lot
longer than you think okay.

01:10:47.726 --> 01:10:50.176
I loved you a lot longer
than you know.

01:10:53.456 --> 01:10:54.836
Jesus Christ.

01:10:54.871 --> 01:10:57.183
The other night, the
other night,

01:10:57.218 --> 01:11:00.394
that was the first time I
ever told you my real name.

01:11:00.428 --> 01:11:01.291
I'm Drew.

01:11:01.326 --> 01:11:02.223
I'm Drew.

01:11:03.431 --> 01:11:04.812
It's me.

01:11:05.951 --> 01:11:07.573
- What the fuck are you saying?

01:11:09.368 --> 01:11:10.196
That...

01:11:11.405 --> 01:11:16.444
- Before I was Robert, I'd
already met you a dozen times.

01:11:16.479 --> 01:11:17.169
- Hmm-mm.

01:11:18.343 --> 01:11:19.896
What the fuck do you mean
"before you where Robert"?

01:11:19.930 --> 01:11:21.311
- I was just telling you.

01:11:21.346 --> 01:11:22.933
I get their memories.

01:11:22.968 --> 01:11:24.590
This is, they're all.

01:11:24.625 --> 01:11:26.696
This is how I fell in
love with the first time.

01:11:26.730 --> 01:11:29.940
I saw you, I saw you and the
love that Richard had for you.

01:11:32.322 --> 01:11:32.978
- Uh uh.

01:11:34.773 --> 01:11:35.601
No.

01:11:35.636 --> 01:11:36.637
- The second time,

01:11:36.671 --> 01:11:38.777
the second time that I
felt that pure love

01:11:38.811 --> 01:11:40.606
was in the love that he
felt for you.

01:11:40.641 --> 01:11:42.815
The love your husband
felt for you.

01:11:42.850 --> 01:11:44.645
Hey, after that,

01:11:44.679 --> 01:11:48.338
after that I knew I
needed to make you happy.

01:11:48.373 --> 01:11:50.340
I needed to make.
- Oh God.

01:11:50.375 --> 01:11:52.308
- I needed to make
everything okay.

01:11:52.342 --> 01:11:53.516
I needed to make it alright.

01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:55.552
- I don't know what
this is right now?

01:11:56.622 --> 01:11:58.279
- That first time we made love,

01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:01.834
I felt such a connection to you.

01:12:01.869 --> 01:12:03.905
I played that Lou Reed song,
you know the one?

01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:05.907
That Lour Reed song you
love so much.

01:12:05.942 --> 01:12:07.737
It was perfect.

01:12:07.771 --> 01:12:10.498
Look, I know you feel it,
I know you know it's me.

01:12:10.533 --> 01:12:14.537
I felt terrible that he
had to leave you.

01:12:14.571 --> 01:12:16.539
That I had to leave you.

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:21.820
- I never told you
about Lou Reed.

01:12:21.854 --> 01:12:23.684
- I was there, it's me.

01:12:23.718 --> 01:12:25.237
I was there.

01:12:27.273 --> 01:12:28.516
- Do you know?

01:12:28.551 --> 01:12:30.449
Do you know something
about Richard?

01:12:33.003 --> 01:12:34.350
Do you know where he is?

01:12:35.489 --> 01:12:36.421
Where is he?

01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:41.702
- He's at that farm.

01:12:41.736 --> 01:12:44.049
The one north of the
city, the one on the news.

01:12:49.330 --> 01:12:52.954
- Who the fuck are you?

01:12:52.989 --> 01:12:54.370
- I don't know.

01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:56.855
I don't know.

01:12:56.889 --> 01:12:57.752
I don't know.

01:12:57.787 --> 01:12:59.375
I don't know who I am.

01:12:59.409 --> 01:13:01.446
I don't even know what I am.

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:02.895
I, I tried to figure it out,

01:13:02.930 --> 01:13:04.552
years ago I tried to
figure it out.

01:13:04.587 --> 01:13:05.898
There's these stories,

01:13:05.933 --> 01:13:07.348
there's these legends in
the Native culture

01:13:07.383 --> 01:13:09.488
about Skinwalkers,
people who take.

01:13:09.523 --> 01:13:12.526
Okay, okay, this doesn't
matter right now.

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.665
What matters is.

01:13:13.699 --> 01:13:15.770
Hey, hey, hey.

01:13:15.805 --> 01:13:17.462
What matters is you
need to understand

01:13:17.496 --> 01:13:19.671
that this was never personal.

01:13:19.705 --> 01:13:21.397
None of this was personal.

01:13:21.431 --> 01:13:22.398
It was about my survival.

01:13:22.432 --> 01:13:24.469
It was about my survival.

01:13:24.503 --> 01:13:26.056
With every single person I took.

01:13:26.816 --> 01:13:28.611
- The ones you killed you mean.

01:13:28.645 --> 01:13:29.646
- No.

01:13:29.681 --> 01:13:31.614
You're not getting this,
you're not getting this.

01:13:31.648 --> 01:13:32.787
Why aren't you getting this?

01:13:32.822 --> 01:13:34.306
Why aren't you getting this?

01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:35.756
Why won't you get this?

01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:36.653
- Robert.

01:13:37.033 --> 01:13:38.068
Robert.

01:13:38.103 --> 01:13:40.554
- Is there a way you
can understand?

01:13:40.588 --> 01:13:41.451
- Drew.

01:13:42.970 --> 01:13:44.420
It's Drew right?

01:13:47.008 --> 01:13:51.979
I need you to let me
leave right now, okay.

01:13:53.359 --> 01:13:54.430
I'm just gonna go.

01:13:54.464 --> 01:13:55.085
- No, no, baby.

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:56.362
- I just wanna go.

01:13:56.397 --> 01:13:57.467
- Hey, I would never hurt you.

01:13:57.502 --> 01:13:59.538
Jeez Julia, I love you.

01:13:59.573 --> 01:14:01.057
I love you and they're not dead.

01:14:01.091 --> 01:14:02.403
Your husband's not dead.

01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:03.059
- Stop.

01:14:03.093 --> 01:14:04.474
- Jesus.
- Right there.

01:14:04.509 --> 01:14:05.337
- Alright.

01:14:05.371 --> 01:14:06.718
- I fucking mean it.

01:14:06.752 --> 01:14:09.410
- Why don't, why
don't you get it?

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:10.342
- God!

01:14:10.376 --> 01:14:11.447
- It's okay.

01:14:11.481 --> 01:14:12.344
Julia, it's okay.

01:14:12.378 --> 01:14:13.518
It's okay, I love you.

01:14:13.552 --> 01:14:14.415
- No.

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:15.761
- I love you...
I'm here for you.

01:14:15.796 --> 01:14:17.970
- Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you fucking kidding me?!?

01:14:18.005 --> 01:14:19.800
- You need to stand back
because I can't control this

01:14:19.834 --> 01:14:21.595
once it starts and I don't
wanna hurt you.

01:14:21.629 --> 01:14:22.734
- You know what, fuck you!

01:14:35.747 --> 01:14:37.058
- No, don't, don't!

01:15:01.842 --> 01:15:02.843
- I'm sorry.

01:15:05.604 --> 01:15:07.744
I didn't mean to hurt you.

01:15:08.642 --> 01:15:11.852
I just wanted to be
close to you.

01:15:29.801 --> 01:15:31.009
- You doing okay Julia?

01:15:43.021 --> 01:15:43.884
- Hey Jen.

01:15:50.476 --> 01:15:53.687
I really appreciate you
taking care of me

01:15:53.721 --> 01:15:54.826
these past few years.

01:15:56.690 --> 01:15:57.794
It really meant a lot.

01:16:34.969 --> 01:16:36.661
- I
spent my entire life

01:16:36.695 --> 01:16:38.559
looking outside for answers.

01:16:39.664 --> 01:16:41.251
But I've always known deep down

01:16:42.183 --> 01:16:44.323
I'm the only one who
can stop this.

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:40.819
I'm not dead.

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:43.132
Why am I not dead?

01:18:51.796 --> 01:18:52.900
- What the hell?

01:18:52.935 --> 01:18:54.315
- What am I?

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:03.635
My mother once told me
nothing lasts forever.

01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:05.292
Everything ends.

01:19:05.326 --> 01:19:08.295
I think maybe she wasn't
entirely right.

01:19:08.329 --> 01:19:10.400
The choices we make
leave echoes.

01:19:10.435 --> 01:19:12.851
The guilt we carry
always lives on.

01:19:12.886 --> 01:19:14.715
You can blame your upbringing,

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:17.304
the wrong ideas you had
about just who you were

01:19:17.338 --> 01:19:18.892
and how the world worked.

01:19:18.926 --> 01:19:21.204
Blame how wrong you were
about everything.

01:19:21.239 --> 01:19:22.792
You try to do better,

01:19:22.827 --> 01:19:23.931
but the guilt lives on.

01:19:23.966 --> 01:19:26.140
The tiny voice in the
back of your mind.

01:19:26.175 --> 01:19:29.074
Starting as a whisper
and building to a chorus.

01:19:29.109 --> 01:19:30.800
Growing until there's
nothing left

01:19:30.835 --> 01:19:31.905
of who you once were.

01:19:31.939 --> 01:19:34.804
Until you can't remember
who you're supposed to be.

01:19:34.839 --> 01:19:38.670
Or maybe there was never anything
of you in the first place?

01:19:38.704 --> 01:19:42.018
Maybe you never really
knew who you were.
