WEBVTT

01:03.522 --> 01:05.483
According to our intelligence,

01:05.608 --> 01:10.571
Gilberto Rodríguez was
a stabilizing influence on the cartel.

01:10.696 --> 01:14.742
His arrest may lead
to an increased violence

01:14.867 --> 01:17.953
against civilians and police.

01:18.079 --> 01:19.413
No doubt...

01:20.539 --> 01:25.586
...the cartel leaders are now in hiding,

01:25.711 --> 01:30.549
and their security apparatus
is operating in a state of high alert.

01:30.674 --> 01:34.637
So, the only thing
we can be certain of

01:34.762 --> 01:37.890
is that any further operation
against the cartel

01:38.015 --> 01:43.104
will be both very difficult
and extremely dangerous.

01:43.229 --> 01:49.026
We appreciate the volatility
of the situation, General.

01:49.151 --> 01:51.612
Well, in that case,
I will turn things over to the man

01:51.737 --> 01:54.073
who's responsible for this situation.

01:55.157 --> 01:58.619
Maybe he can walk us
through his path to victory.

01:58.744 --> 02:02.957
So Agent Peña, what comes next?
The floor is yours.

03:59.949 --> 04:01.033
Don Gilberto...

04:02.826 --> 04:05.246
- Leave it there.
- Okay.

04:07.957 --> 04:09.625
Enjoy your meal.

04:29.103 --> 04:31.981
- Hello?
- 'Hi, brother, it's me.

04:32.106 --> 04:37.403
- 'How are you doing?'
- Better if I knew how this happened.

04:37.528 --> 04:43.200
'Gilberto, someone betrayed us.
Where the fuck were those pigs we pay?'

04:43.325 --> 04:46.078
It was an American operation.
It was the DEA.

04:46.203 --> 04:49.623
Our friends knew nothing about it.

04:49.748 --> 04:54.003
Unless our friends
have been lying to us all along.

04:54.128 --> 04:58.590
Maybe they need a reminder
what all that money was for.

04:58.716 --> 05:02.469
Relax, Miguel.
My situation will be rectified soon.

05:02.594 --> 05:05.764
'The truth is that things
are getting more complicated.'

05:05.889 --> 05:09.226
And our friends in the North Valley
need reassurance.

05:09.685 --> 05:12.396
You need to set a meeting
with Henao.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.648
'Compliment him.'

05:15.316 --> 05:18.610
- On what?
- Doesn't matter. Offer him something.

05:18.736 --> 05:22.406
'He likes tequila.
Have a bottle ready.'

05:22.531 --> 05:27.453
Tell him...
this is just a small setback.

05:28.120 --> 05:31.915
'In the meantime,
business goes on as usual.'

05:32.041 --> 05:34.793
Increase your personal security.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.921
'The Americans
will come after you next.

05:38.047 --> 05:41.133
'Your freedom is our best leverage,
brother.'

05:41.258 --> 05:43.927
Gilberto, this is getting dangerous.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.098
What if there's a leak?

05:51.727 --> 05:55.439
There may be.
Find out.

05:55.564 --> 05:58.025
'I need to go, brother. I love you.'

05:58.150 --> 06:00.110
I love you too, brother.

06:05.074 --> 06:09.453
- 'What do you got for me?'
- Dog shit. Minus the dog and the shit.

06:10.079 --> 06:13.499
Well, we knew it wasn't gonna be easy.
You gotta get creative.

06:13.624 --> 06:17.586
All due respect, we're being told
we can't leave the base without an escort,

06:17.711 --> 06:20.547
and now,
in a truly shocking turn of events,

06:20.672 --> 06:23.425
we're being told there isn't enough
manpower to assign us one.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.761
'We're fucking grounded.'

06:27.179 --> 06:30.099
Look, I'll see what I can do
with the lockdown. I gotta go.

06:30.224 --> 06:32.142
I'm meeting with the new
Minister of Defence.

06:32.267 --> 06:35.521
And Feistl... you asked for this.

06:35.646 --> 06:38.190
'Don't forget that, cos I know I won't.'

06:43.153 --> 06:45.489
'Colombia had recently
elected a new president,

06:45.614 --> 06:48.742
'a man named Ernesto Samper.

06:48.867 --> 06:52.121
'Escobar's hitters had tried
to assassinate him in an earlier election.

06:52.246 --> 06:54.498
'So he was no friend of the narcos.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.585
'And while he knew his country
was tired of violence,

06:58.710 --> 07:03.006
'he and his new staff, including
Defence Minister Fernando Botero,

07:03.132 --> 07:04.758
'were already in a tough spot.

07:05.342 --> 07:10.597
'Politically, the surrender deal was ugly,
but they were willing to live with it.

07:10.722 --> 07:13.183
'Gilberto's arrest made that
harder than planned,

07:13.308 --> 07:16.019
'and they weren't shy about saying it.'

07:16.145 --> 07:19.648
I wanted to offer
my congratulations

07:19.773 --> 07:21.692
on the arrest of Gilberto Rodríguez.

07:21.817 --> 07:23.485
Thank you, sir.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.821
Colonel Martínez deserves the credit.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.906
Unfortunately,
he isn't here to receive it.

07:29.283 --> 07:30.701
He should be.

07:30.826 --> 07:34.079
I imagine he knew there might be
consequences for his actions.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.331
A surrender deal was on the table,

07:36.457 --> 07:40.377
which would've brought all four leaders
of the Cali cartel to justice.

07:40.961 --> 07:45.466
And now, that's been complicated,
and we are faced with the unknown.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.342
Understood.

07:47.468 --> 07:51.680
Though I'm not sure murderers negotiating
their own punishment qualifies as justice.

07:55.726 --> 07:57.895
The deal preceded my tenure.

07:58.520 --> 08:01.899
But between the two of us,
I share your reservations.

08:02.441 --> 08:05.194
But no one wants a return
to the days of Pablo Escobar

08:05.319 --> 08:07.237
and the bloodshed of Los Pepes.

08:08.322 --> 08:09.823
No, of course not.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.242
I won't ask if the rumours

08:12.367 --> 08:14.661
about your involvement
with the vigilantes are true,

08:14.786 --> 08:16.788
but I do have a question.

08:18.290 --> 08:22.044
If it turns out that
we are indeed on the same side,

08:22.169 --> 08:23.754
can I trust you?

08:25.547 --> 08:28.800
You can trust that my only agenda
is to take down the Cali cartel.

08:30.636 --> 08:33.013
Let me know if I can do anything.

08:33.138 --> 08:36.975
Sir, my team in Cali
are operating under...

08:38.769 --> 08:40.604
...severe restrictions.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.065
They need their independence.

08:44.149 --> 08:46.235
I'll make a call.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.028
Thank you, sir.

08:50.656 --> 08:52.241
Peña...

08:52.366 --> 08:55.452
Justice can be hard to find.

08:56.328 --> 08:58.747
And a man as powerful
as Gilberto Rodríguez

08:58.872 --> 09:01.208
won't stay in custody for long.

09:02.125 --> 09:06.964
If you want to keep him behind bars,
you need someone to testify.

09:07.089 --> 09:09.091
Yes, sir. I'm on it.

09:10.217 --> 09:13.887
I'm working on a high-level target.

09:15.973 --> 09:18.684
I suggest you work fast,
because without it,

09:18.809 --> 09:20.811
nothing else will matter.

09:24.648 --> 09:28.694
We went through the machine, sir.
We've got nothing.

09:30.529 --> 09:33.865
So what am I supposed to do with that?
What does this mean?

09:35.951 --> 09:40.038
If somebody sold us out,
we'd know about it.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.376
Like you knew about the raid?

09:48.797 --> 09:50.716
Look, gentlemen...

09:50.841 --> 09:57.180
I want to know why my brother
is sitting in a fucking cell.

09:57.306 --> 10:02.394
And if any one of us is involved in this,
I want to know by the end of the day.

10:03.645 --> 10:06.356
Of course. Consider it done, sir.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.913
Miguel's paranoid.

10:22.914 --> 10:28.420
Maybe they used one of their spy planes
and spotted Gilberto from space.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.756
You're not taking this seriously.

10:31.965 --> 10:35.177
Miguel doesn't think they got lucky.
He thinks there's a leak.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.305
And the system would tell us
about the leak.

10:38.889 --> 10:41.308
This is about the surrender, right?

10:41.433 --> 10:44.102
You're worried your retirement plans
are ruined now.

10:44.895 --> 10:49.816
Listen to me. People love drama, brother.
You know that.

10:49.941 --> 10:51.735
This isn't drama. He wants names.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.363
And there's no reason to think
they couldn't be ours, Carlo.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.406
We designed the system.

11:08.794 --> 11:10.212
Mr. Cordova.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.676
So? Anything good?

11:16.510 --> 11:20.013
Just a bunch of shit-talking.
Gossip. Typical.

11:20.138 --> 11:23.350
And what about internally?
Anyone suspicious you've flagged?

11:23.475 --> 11:28.522
No, not really. Truth is, I have no idea
who would rat these guys out.

11:28.647 --> 11:32.734
I want to hear everything you've flagged,
all the same. Quickly.

11:32.859 --> 11:35.278
Yes, sir. I'll get that right away.

11:44.955 --> 11:47.874
'These guys were supposed
to have all this under control.

11:47.999 --> 11:50.043
'But it's clear they don't.'

11:52.212 --> 11:54.840
'I thought those guys
were supposed to surrender.

11:54.965 --> 11:57.259
'Does this mean it's not happening?'

11:57.384 --> 12:01.638
'Somebody tipped off
the Americans, stabbed us in the back.'

12:04.725 --> 12:09.020
'Where was his fucking security
team? What do they pay them for?'

12:11.565 --> 12:13.775
'They better do something quick,

12:13.900 --> 12:16.486
'or else it's going to be
every man for himself.'

12:22.993 --> 12:25.787
You have many powerful allies,
Don Gilberto.

12:25.912 --> 12:28.290
Your situation pains them deeply.

12:28.415 --> 12:32.043
We're confident this will soon be
behind us. The surrender will proceed.

12:32.169 --> 12:35.213
But we need to wait.
It's a matter of time.

12:35.338 --> 12:37.174
Wait for what?

12:37.299 --> 12:40.927
For the government to do something
they already agreed to? Fuck.

12:41.052 --> 12:42.471
What did Medina say?

12:44.514 --> 12:48.560
Currently, we don't have
an official position from Santiago Medina.

12:48.685 --> 12:49.978
Why not?

12:53.690 --> 12:56.943
Because we're waiting on his office
to confirm a meeting.

12:59.488 --> 13:02.866
Are you fucking kidding me?
You didn't talk to him yet?

13:02.991 --> 13:06.161
You're waiting on his office
to confirm a meeting?

13:06.745 --> 13:08.747
I don't wait on him!

13:08.872 --> 13:10.665
He waits on me!

13:10.791 --> 13:12.834
You go to his office and fix this mess!

13:12.959 --> 13:16.588
And remind him who the fuck
Gilberto Rodríguez is!

13:18.757 --> 13:21.134
For fuck's sake!
Open this damn thing!

13:21.676 --> 13:25.972
Nicolás, your father needs to understand
his arrest changes things.

13:26.097 --> 13:27.599
It's political now.

13:30.101 --> 13:31.436
Dad?

13:32.479 --> 13:34.940
Sometimes you have to put on
a little show.

13:35.065 --> 13:37.150
Helps bring the best out of people.

13:37.818 --> 13:41.363
- I need to talk to Medina.
- I don't want you anywhere near this.

13:42.113 --> 13:44.825
Dad, the circle is too big.

13:44.950 --> 13:49.579
Medina won't meet anyone he can't trust.
He won't trust the lawyers.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.915
But he will trust you?

13:53.667 --> 13:55.669
Yes, I'm your son.

13:55.794 --> 13:59.005
That's right.
And you'll obey my wishes.

14:07.556 --> 14:10.141
'It's cold here all the time.

14:10.267 --> 14:13.603
'I wake up
and the bed is freezing, empty.'

14:13.728 --> 14:16.189
'I know,<i>bonita.</i>
I'll be home soon.'

14:16.314 --> 14:18.942
'I just wish
I could be there with you.'

14:19.067 --> 14:23.905
'I told you, Chris, it wouldn't look right.
it's not a good time.'

14:24.030 --> 14:27.200
- Any word on the location?
- Nothing yet.

14:28.076 --> 14:31.329
'I don't know, Franklin.
Maybe now is the perfect fucking time.

14:31.454 --> 14:33.874
'You really think
they're gonna stop with Gilberto?

14:33.999 --> 14:37.210
'And how long before the DEA
comes looking for you? For us?'

14:37.335 --> 14:39.796
'Listen, I need you
to be strong, okay, babe?

14:39.921 --> 14:44.050
'Nobody knows about us.
Nobody's looking for me, I promise.

14:44.175 --> 14:46.928
- 'I'll call you later. I love you.'
- 'No, wait, Franklin...'

14:48.013 --> 14:49.472
She's panicking.

14:53.143 --> 14:54.561
Where are you going?

14:54.686 --> 14:56.688
To give things a push.
We're running out of time.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.982
Okay, can we talk
about this wiretap, though?

14:59.649 --> 15:01.860
I mean, the legality of it?

15:06.948 --> 15:08.700
Stoddard...

15:12.495 --> 15:15.999
I want you to think about where
you see your career in five years.

15:16.124 --> 15:20.170
Does having that conversation help
or hurt your chances of getting there?

15:52.535 --> 15:55.205
You want something to drink?

15:55.330 --> 15:57.749
I never refuse.

16:08.969 --> 16:10.595
That's a great shirt, no?

16:13.932 --> 16:18.311
That pocket... on the left.

16:21.564 --> 16:23.316
Where the heart is.

16:33.284 --> 16:38.790
Hey, this situation with Gilberto,
what a disgrace, huh?

16:40.291 --> 16:44.879
After all your family's done
for this city. For this country.

16:47.590 --> 16:50.552
Just the gringos meddling
where they shouldn't.

16:51.177 --> 16:54.556
But our friends in Bogotá
are working to...

16:55.932 --> 16:58.184
...rectify the situation.

17:00.854 --> 17:03.690
Business proceeds as usual, right?

17:03.815 --> 17:08.611
And how does this clerical error
affect the timeline of the surrender?

17:10.488 --> 17:12.240
As I said...

17:13.575 --> 17:17.162
...this was just a mistake.
Nothing more.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.541
Glad to hear that.

17:41.770 --> 17:43.813
I see a lot of new faces.

18:10.799 --> 18:13.259
Did you notice that?

18:13.384 --> 18:15.637
The woman, the Salazar girl?

18:16.221 --> 18:18.014
The fear.

18:18.139 --> 18:20.100
Miguel was scared.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.357
These guys are in big trouble.

18:36.074 --> 18:38.660
Little early for number three, no?

18:39.327 --> 18:41.538
The fuck else am I supposed to do
around here?

18:41.663 --> 18:43.164
You didn't have to come.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.292
Who else was gonna watch your back?

18:51.339 --> 18:53.758
You gonna tell me
what went down in Juárez?

18:54.259 --> 18:55.593
I told you...

18:56.594 --> 18:57.929
...we talked.

19:00.849 --> 19:03.017
The Mexican made you an offer.

19:04.519 --> 19:06.062
Didn't he?

19:11.192 --> 19:12.485
Yes.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.738
A pretty good one, too.

19:17.115 --> 19:20.660
He says we're getting out
at the wrong time.

19:23.454 --> 19:24.914
Maybe he's right.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.752
Gilberto's in jail.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.174
Maybe this is fate.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.316
How'd you come up with this place?

19:53.318 --> 19:55.528
Buddy in the Defence Department.

19:55.653 --> 19:58.531
The place was leased out
to debrief a witness against Noriega.

19:58.656 --> 20:00.491
That was like three years ago.

20:08.082 --> 20:10.835
Danny, you never cease to amaze me.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.296
Not bad, right?

20:13.421 --> 20:15.548
Well, the fucking A/C's still running.

20:15.673 --> 20:17.967
Yeah, your tax dollars at work.

20:25.808 --> 20:27.769
So? What's our first move?

20:28.937 --> 20:32.190
Circle back. See if we can pick up
a trail on that accountant.

20:36.694 --> 20:39.239
World's deadliest fanny pack,
back in action.

20:39.364 --> 20:41.532
Better fucking believe it.

21:10.186 --> 21:12.605
No, the bill, please.

21:12.730 --> 21:15.191
Compliments of the gentleman.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.368
- Thank you, but I don't...
- Oh, uh...

21:26.577 --> 21:29.122
Did I come over too fast?

21:30.331 --> 21:32.292
It's tricky business
starting a conversation.

21:32.417 --> 21:34.335
Not a lot of margin for error.

21:34.460 --> 21:39.757
- You're an American.
- Yeah. Javi. From Texas.

21:40.550 --> 21:44.512
- You?
- I'm from Boston originally.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.098
Strangers in a strange land.

21:48.266 --> 21:50.768
Well, I hope you don't mind. I was...

21:52.103 --> 21:54.230
I saw you sitting over here and you...

21:55.857 --> 21:58.484
...reminded me of someone,
someone from home.

21:58.609 --> 22:01.112
Ah! Sentimental.

22:01.904 --> 22:03.865
Just a lonely patriot.

22:05.116 --> 22:07.410
Anyway, I thought we could talk.

22:08.328 --> 22:10.496
- Okay.
- No, I mean it. Just...

22:12.623 --> 22:14.042
Just talk.

22:14.167 --> 22:16.961
- I heard people still do that sometimes.
- Oh, yeah.

22:17.086 --> 22:19.213
You know,
I think I saw it in a movie once.

22:21.174 --> 22:23.301
Look, you seem like a nice guy,

22:23.426 --> 22:26.679
but I get the feeling
that just talking isn't your forte.

22:27.263 --> 22:31.100
- And... I'm married, so...
- Happily?

22:31.225 --> 22:34.228
Wow. Look at you now.

22:34.354 --> 22:36.731
What? I mean, come on.

22:37.482 --> 22:40.735
Your husband lets you brave the dangers
of happy hour by yourself?

22:41.694 --> 22:44.197
He's traveling for work.

22:44.322 --> 22:46.991
Oh, can I guess? He's...

22:49.494 --> 22:51.871
...an astronaut.

22:51.996 --> 22:54.791
- Brain surgeon.
- Yeah, uh-huh, a little bit of both.

22:54.916 --> 22:56.417
- Uh-huh.
- Banking.

22:56.542 --> 22:59.295
Oh, fuck.
I thought I couldn't like him any less.

22:59.420 --> 23:01.714
I mean...

23:02.340 --> 23:04.300
Okay, well, this has been fun.

23:05.510 --> 23:09.222
So, what exotic destination
could pull him away from...

23:11.182 --> 23:12.683
...from all this?

23:18.981 --> 23:21.192
Say hi to Texas for me.

23:21.943 --> 23:23.361
Christina...

23:27.198 --> 23:29.075
I didn't tell you my name.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.952
You didn't have to.

23:34.163 --> 23:38.543
Okay... You got me.
How do you know my name?

23:38.668 --> 23:42.964
Same way I know that your husband...
isn't in banking.

23:43.881 --> 23:45.925
My name's Javier Peña.
I work for the DEA.

23:47.552 --> 23:49.929
You want to sit back down,
have a conversation?

23:53.224 --> 23:56.978
I'm not interested.
Enjoy your drink, Eliot Ness.

24:01.232 --> 24:02.567
Fuck.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.612
The bill.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.576
And they don't appear
on the next flights either?

24:12.743 --> 24:14.912
No.

24:16.706 --> 24:22.420
Jorge... Motherfucking gringos
never got on a plane back to Bogotá.

24:22.545 --> 24:26.174
- Our friend with the badge lied to us.
- Or he made a mistake.

24:27.216 --> 24:29.135
There are no mistakes.

24:36.684 --> 24:38.644
Hey. Here he comes.

24:39.228 --> 24:41.355
There he is, the fucking bastard.

24:42.732 --> 24:45.526
I would have gladly met you
in the usual place.

24:46.736 --> 24:49.238
That's what you're worried about?

24:49.363 --> 24:52.783
How about earning the money we pay you
to keep our bosses out of jail?

24:52.909 --> 24:55.745
- You couldn't give a fuck about that.
- The fuck you want from me?

24:55.870 --> 24:59.248
Logistics, planning, the dummy raid.
All that shit came out of Bogotá.

24:59.373 --> 25:00.833
By the time we knew
what they were up to...

25:00.958 --> 25:04.462
Martínez had already been
in Gilberto's house for 30 minutes,

25:04.587 --> 25:06.839
you useless piece of shit.

25:09.383 --> 25:11.385
You know what else is odd?

25:12.637 --> 25:16.516
It looks like the DEA never left Cali.
And you were the one who confirmed.

25:17.642 --> 25:23.314
You, only you, confirmed those two
fucking gringos took the plane to Bogotá.

25:27.485 --> 25:29.237
Do you know where you are?

25:29.362 --> 25:34.283
You want to hang me out to dry with
your boss? Do you know where you are?

25:35.785 --> 25:39.789
I asked the Americans how they found
Gilberto's house. Know what they told me?

25:39.914 --> 25:42.667
They followed someone there.

25:46.337 --> 25:49.048
I know it wasn't me.

26:08.359 --> 26:10.027
Fucking Calderón.

26:11.153 --> 26:12.989
What he said made sense.

26:13.573 --> 26:16.492
The DEA followed someone
to Gilberto's house.

26:17.243 --> 26:20.746
It must be Pallomari. The DEA knows
who he is and where he works.

26:21.664 --> 26:24.166
They must've come back
and tailed him to Gilberto.

26:28.671 --> 26:32.383
Didn't you say you drove Pallomari
to Gilberto's that night?

26:38.598 --> 26:41.559
It could just as easily have been me
driving him.

26:44.645 --> 26:47.106
Yeah, but it wasn't, was it?

26:47.231 --> 26:49.775
You think Miguel will let this slide?

26:51.444 --> 26:53.154
Not a fucking chance.

26:53.279 --> 26:56.616
Jorge, if this thing comes back on me,
it comes back on you,

26:56.741 --> 26:58.367
and then we're both fucked.

26:58.951 --> 27:02.747
The only thing we need is a name,
and we have it.

27:03.831 --> 27:06.083
We have to get on the same page here.

27:07.501 --> 27:11.756
Calderón told us those fuckers from
the DEA got on a plane to Bogotá, right?

27:11.881 --> 27:16.844
He burned us. He's the one
responsible for what happened.

27:16.969 --> 27:19.180
He's a dirty cop...

27:21.307 --> 27:23.309
...who takes money from a drug cartel.

27:26.896 --> 27:30.650
But you and me, we are brothers.

27:41.744 --> 27:45.081
Let me cut to the chase.
My father still wants to retire.

27:49.585 --> 27:54.298
I didn't realise you were taking such
an active role in your father's affairs.

27:55.966 --> 27:59.637
No other choice when friends
don't return our lawyer's calls.

28:01.097 --> 28:02.473
Of course.

28:04.392 --> 28:05.726
Well, then,

28:05.851 --> 28:12.775
tell your father there is still a path
to what he wants most.

28:14.568 --> 28:17.279
No one here is happy
with the current predicament.

28:18.280 --> 28:24.036
The DEA blindsided all of us, and it's
been difficult to carry out our old deal.

28:25.579 --> 28:27.248
"Old deal"?

28:30.334 --> 28:31.627
Nicolás...

28:33.587 --> 28:37.341
Politics is about appearances.

28:37.842 --> 28:41.178
For us, it's extremely difficult
to accept the surrender terms

28:41.303 --> 28:43.848
of a man who's already in prison.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.309
That just looks bad.

28:51.522 --> 28:55.443
But different terms, new terms...

28:57.528 --> 28:59.155
What do you say?

29:09.123 --> 29:11.333
So what did you find out?

29:13.127 --> 29:17.047
The DEA team that Calderón
was escorting never left Cali.

29:18.048 --> 29:20.176
He reported that they had.

29:23.721 --> 29:27.433
- What do you think, Jorge?
- It was a mistake.

29:28.559 --> 29:30.478
Born of incompetence.

29:31.270 --> 29:36.066
The DEA got lucky...
and Calderón took the bait.

29:37.651 --> 29:40.738
Well, we're not paying for incompetence.

29:42.198 --> 29:45.534
Besides, that doesn't explain
how they found my brother.

29:45.659 --> 29:49.079
How did they get that information?
Was that also Calderón?

29:50.331 --> 29:52.082
It's unlikely.

29:53.209 --> 29:58.631
It's possible the DEA used
some high-end aerial surveillance.

30:03.803 --> 30:07.681
From here on out,
keep an eye on Calderón.

30:10.100 --> 30:14.772
Limit what we tell him.
No more lapses in security.

30:15.272 --> 30:17.316
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

30:32.790 --> 30:34.708
Thank you, Jorge.

30:36.544 --> 30:38.295
It's either him or us.

30:40.130 --> 30:41.757
What if they kill him?

30:43.843 --> 30:46.262
They wouldn't kill a cop.

30:47.763 --> 30:50.891
But they can question him.
And then what? What?

30:52.268 --> 30:56.730
By the time they get to it,
this shit will all be over.

31:22.965 --> 31:24.049
Hello?

31:24.174 --> 31:29.513
'Good afternoon. Someone is here
for you, Mrs. Jurado. Mr. Eliot Ness.'

31:35.519 --> 31:37.354
Thanks for seeing me.

31:37.479 --> 31:40.107
Didn't want you waving a badge
around our lobby.

31:44.028 --> 31:46.614
Are you gonna arrest me?

31:49.992 --> 31:51.785
You want to sit?

31:53.245 --> 31:55.122
If what I wanted counted for anything,

31:55.247 --> 31:58.542
you wouldn't be
in my living room right now.

31:58.667 --> 32:03.172
May not see it this way yet,
but I... I am here to help you.

32:05.174 --> 32:08.093
Oh, I'm sure my well-being
is your top priority.

32:08.552 --> 32:10.971
It's why you were buying me
martinis at the bar.

32:16.769 --> 32:19.021
Gilberto Rodríguez is in jail.

32:20.189 --> 32:22.900
It won't be long before he has company.

32:23.025 --> 32:26.946
There's a very small window
for people like you and your husband

32:27.071 --> 32:29.907
to still be of any use to us.

32:30.032 --> 32:31.742
You're running out of time.

32:32.368 --> 32:36.205
So if Franklin really does care about you,
then he'll do what's right.

32:37.790 --> 32:41.794
I mean, I don't know if the two of you
are thinking about starting a family...

32:41.919 --> 32:45.547
Okay, look, for the record, you don't know
a fucking thing about my husband or me.

32:48.467 --> 32:49.969
Okay. You're right.

32:52.554 --> 32:55.182
But I do know that
there is no future for you

32:55.307 --> 32:58.435
in any version of how this plays out
if he doesn't help us.

33:07.027 --> 33:09.446
I didn't plan on living like this.
It was...

33:10.698 --> 33:15.285
It was a mistake...
not stopping it sooner.

33:17.705 --> 33:20.207
You ever done anything like that?

33:20.332 --> 33:21.959
I have.

33:24.753 --> 33:25.963
Okay.

33:29.800 --> 33:32.845
So... what, that's it?

33:36.515 --> 33:38.183
That's it.

33:47.276 --> 33:50.612
Think it over.
But don't take too long.

34:09.715 --> 34:13.343
Don't you even
want to know what he said?

34:14.094 --> 34:16.346
How dare you disregard my wishes.

34:18.140 --> 34:20.225
Nobody was going to get into a room
with Medina, and I did...

34:20.350 --> 34:25.147
I don't want you involved.
I won't even discuss it.

34:25.856 --> 34:28.150
The old deal is dead.

34:34.490 --> 34:37.826
But we can make a new one,
with certain adjustments.

34:40.871 --> 34:42.372
Motherfuckers.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.127
Adjustments how?

34:48.921 --> 34:51.131
There has to be some jail time.

34:51.965 --> 34:55.886
For you, Uncle Miguel,
Pacho and Chepe.

34:56.470 --> 35:00.516
- Three years.
- Three years? No chance.

35:02.226 --> 35:06.980
You surrender your illegal assets,
do the three years,

35:07.106 --> 35:10.609
and the legitimate assets, the cash,
the business, will all be retained.

35:10.734 --> 35:14.196
That's not the deal.
And you won't speak of this again.

35:14.321 --> 35:16.824
Dad, stop being so stubborn!

35:29.962 --> 35:32.297
You don't get to surrender.

35:33.257 --> 35:36.176
You are in jail.
You are a narcotrafficker.

35:36.301 --> 35:41.390
No politician is going to stand up
and say, "Let him go,"

35:41.515 --> 35:44.685
no matter how much money
you've put in his pocket.

35:47.020 --> 35:49.022
But son, it's three years...

35:55.737 --> 35:57.906
It's not the old deal,
but it's a good one.

35:59.158 --> 36:01.243
The best we're going to get.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.748
But there's one loose end.

36:08.292 --> 36:10.919
Medina is worried about his exposure.

36:13.338 --> 36:17.176
More specifically,
the accountant... Pallomari.

36:18.051 --> 36:20.053
He knows too much.

36:24.474 --> 36:25.642
<i>'Hola, bonita.'</i>

36:25.767 --> 36:28.312
Baby, I thought
you said that you were gonna call.

36:28.896 --> 36:30.939
'I know. I had a late meeting.'

36:31.064 --> 36:32.691
Sorry, babe. I'm sorry.

36:32.816 --> 36:34.735
Can you leave it there?

36:34.860 --> 36:37.613
<i>Danki masha danki.</i>
Right?

36:37.738 --> 36:40.866
'Thank you.
Sorry. Room service.'

36:42.618 --> 36:45.746
How many of those little cakes
have you eaten so far?

36:45.871 --> 36:48.081
I can see our island from my room.

36:48.916 --> 36:50.751
'I miss you,<i>bonita.'</i>

36:54.880 --> 36:58.967
Franklin... what are we gonna do?

37:02.012 --> 37:04.598
Christina, you can't just walk away
from these people.

37:04.723 --> 37:07.851
I know you keep saying that,
but maybe...

37:07.976 --> 37:11.188
maybe we have more options
than we think.

37:12.064 --> 37:14.691
What do you mean,
"more options"?

37:14.816 --> 37:18.070
'You know things. You know things
about the organisation...'

37:18.195 --> 37:21.198
'You want me to be a rat?
Have you been talking to someone?'

37:21.323 --> 37:26.078
'No, I just... Franklin, we need to talk.
We really need to talk about the future.'

37:26.203 --> 37:28.705
'We can't do this
on the phone. I'll call you later.'

37:28.830 --> 37:30.374
Rewind.

37:32.834 --> 37:34.503
Okay.

37:35.337 --> 37:38.966
'I had a late meeting.
Sorry, babe. I'm sorry.

37:39.091 --> 37:43.387
'Can you leave it there?
<i>Danki masha danki.</i> Right?

37:43.512 --> 37:46.598
'Thank you.
Sorry. Room service.'

37:51.311 --> 37:53.814
I think I might know where he is.

38:02.030 --> 38:04.783
They probably set up shop
somewhere else after the raid.

38:14.126 --> 38:15.502
'Salcedo.'

38:15.627 --> 38:18.088
The Americans are back
on the accountant's office,

38:18.213 --> 38:20.090
hoping he shows.

38:21.133 --> 38:23.176
Knowing that idiot, he might.

38:24.428 --> 38:27.639
If that's all they've got,
then they don't have much.

38:28.974 --> 38:34.062
'Stay on them.
Find out where they sleep at night.'

38:35.105 --> 38:39.651
All right.
Hey, boss. You doing okay?

38:40.235 --> 38:44.740
- 'You sound tired.'
- Yeah. I'm fine.

38:45.991 --> 38:47.909
Keep me posted.

38:56.209 --> 38:58.545
- How was the science test?
- Good.

38:58.670 --> 38:59.838
Daddy!

39:00.380 --> 39:01.673
Daddy!

39:01.798 --> 39:05.218
My princess. Hello, my princesses.
How are you all?

39:05.344 --> 39:07.262
Hello. What are you doing here?

39:07.387 --> 39:08.638
Hi, my love.

39:08.764 --> 39:11.058
Was it your turn or mine
to pick up the girls?

39:11.183 --> 39:14.895
Yours. I was in the neighbourhood.
Just wanted to see how my girls are doing.

39:15.020 --> 39:18.023
- Daddy, today we have piano lessons.
- I know, my love.

39:18.607 --> 39:20.317
My little virtuosos.

39:20.901 --> 39:22.486
And you? Everything okay?

39:23.111 --> 39:24.571
I'm fine.

39:24.696 --> 39:27.949
I just felt like I needed to see my girls.
That's why I came.

39:31.828 --> 39:33.663
Excuse me.

39:36.208 --> 39:38.043
Looks like I have to go.

39:38.919 --> 39:41.046
Would you excuse me? Okay?

39:41.963 --> 39:44.591
- Girls... I love you.
- Bye.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.468
Bye, be good.

39:48.136 --> 39:49.262
Salcedo.

39:49.846 --> 39:53.225
- 'Where are you?'
- What can I do for you, David?

39:53.350 --> 39:57.437
'My dad called a meeting.
Top personnel.'

39:57.562 --> 40:00.565
What do you mean, a meeting?
We just had one.

40:00.690 --> 40:02.692
'Well, we're having another one.

40:02.818 --> 40:06.238
'2611 Avenida 14. Out by Jamundí.
See you there.'

40:21.795 --> 40:24.339
'It's Carlo Cordova.
Leave a message.'

40:24.464 --> 40:26.425
Carlo, I just talked to David.

40:26.550 --> 40:29.094
Are you on your way to the meeting?
Call me.

40:32.556 --> 40:35.392
Stoddard. Get this.

40:35.976 --> 40:39.187
According to the language guy at SLS,
<i>Dasha masha danki</i>

40:39.312 --> 40:42.607
means: "Thank you very much"
in Papiamento.

40:43.316 --> 40:45.110
Okay.

40:45.902 --> 40:46.903
Curaçao.

40:47.654 --> 40:50.365
Curaçao... I guess there's
a lot of banks there.

40:50.490 --> 40:53.702
Yeah, there's a lot
of fucking banks there. Here it is.

40:54.286 --> 40:57.539
Baoase Luxury Resort.
Has an island villa you can rent.

40:58.165 --> 40:59.666
Okay. What do we do then?

40:59.791 --> 41:02.669
Call the Dutch Caribbean police
in Willemstad.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.463
Ask them if they can confirm

41:04.588 --> 41:07.132
anyone staying under
one of Franklin Jurado's aliases.

41:10.802 --> 41:13.763
- We got him, didn't we?
- Not yet.

41:14.639 --> 41:16.141
But he's there.

41:16.266 --> 41:17.893
- Call them.
- Yeah.

42:52.821 --> 42:55.073
'It's Carlo Cordova.
Leave a message.'

43:08.003 --> 43:11.673
I'm sitting there,
enjoying my dick getting sucked,

43:11.798 --> 43:14.634
when all of the sudden she stops.

43:16.094 --> 43:18.388
I open my eyes
and I ask her, "What's up?"

43:19.139 --> 43:21.558
She's all quiet,
looking at me like this.

43:22.058 --> 43:23.727
Not a word.

43:23.852 --> 43:26.563
I'm like, "What the fuck?"
I turn to see Toque.

43:26.688 --> 43:32.444
Fuck, he has a gun pointed at him.
Like this.

43:32.569 --> 43:35.405
And the other girl,
the one with the gun, says to me:

43:36.323 --> 43:41.661
"Give me the money,
or she bites your dick off."

43:45.999 --> 43:48.960
- So what did you do?
- I gave her the fucking money!

43:49.085 --> 43:53.214
I even tipped her, Pacho.
You don't mess around with that!

43:53.840 --> 43:55.925
- You want some ice?
- Sure.

43:59.012 --> 44:00.889
I'm having a great time.

44:01.389 --> 44:03.350
I'm heading to Juárez tomorrow.

44:04.684 --> 44:07.771
Got some business with my partners.

44:09.439 --> 44:12.025
What am I going to tell them, Pacho?

44:12.150 --> 44:16.196
I want to give them an answer.
Some good news.

44:23.578 --> 44:25.830
My turn to tell you a story, Amado.

44:27.248 --> 44:30.794
About the time my father found me
in my room with a boy.

44:30.919 --> 44:34.297
Hey, I never judged you for that stuff.

44:35.840 --> 44:39.511
My father told me I wasn't a man,
that I'd never be one.

44:40.011 --> 44:43.848
- It was the last time he spoke to me.
- What a fucking bastard.

44:46.059 --> 44:48.687
For a long time,
I thought he was right.

44:48.812 --> 44:51.481
Even after I started working
for Gilberto and Miguel.

44:52.148 --> 44:56.736
Up until the day some motherfucker
told them I was a faggot.

44:57.195 --> 44:59.948
And that it was a mistake
to let me be part of the business.

45:03.410 --> 45:05.370
You know what they did?

45:08.206 --> 45:10.166
They made me a partner.

45:12.377 --> 45:15.588
Gilberto, Miguel and Chepe,
they are my family.

45:16.840 --> 45:20.051
I can't just leave them
when they need me the most.

45:24.055 --> 45:25.807
What can I say?

45:27.392 --> 45:31.479
I admire your loyalty.
You're one of a kind.

45:34.399 --> 45:36.317
There you go.

46:23.907 --> 46:26.659
You better get inside.
Don't want to be late.

46:48.681 --> 46:50.308
Has your dad arrived?

46:52.060 --> 46:53.645
No, not yet.

46:54.813 --> 46:56.231
Let's go.

46:56.689 --> 46:59.192
♪ I'm overwhelmed
As my mind roams the realm

46:59.317 --> 47:01.611
♪ My eye's the visions
Memory is the film

47:01.736 --> 47:05.406
♪ Others act sub-tile
But they fragile above cloud

47:07.367 --> 47:10.245

♪ And throw all types of fit

47:14.707 --> 47:17.460
♪ I leave them split like ass cheeks
And ragged pussy lips

Let me go, motherfucker!

47:45.530 --> 47:47.365
You don't have the balls!

47:49.158 --> 47:51.119
Let me go!

47:54.956 --> 47:56.291
Ah!

48:01.754 --> 48:03.047
Up!

48:06.718 --> 48:08.469
You motherfucker.

48:09.053 --> 48:11.931
What the fuck did you tell them,
motherfucker?

48:12.056 --> 48:14.225
Gilberto getting caught wasn't on me.

48:14.809 --> 48:17.270
You feel so safe, motherfucker.

48:18.271 --> 48:20.231
When it's your turn...

49:21.250 --> 49:22.919
He was a tiger.

49:26.464 --> 49:27.966
Let's go.

49:57.161 --> 49:58.955
What the fuck is this?

49:59.914 --> 50:01.916
Tell him what you did.

50:03.334 --> 50:05.670
Tell him.
Tell him where we caught you.

50:08.506 --> 50:10.925
While you were visiting
your wife and children,

50:11.050 --> 50:14.804
this fucking rat was
on his way to the airport.

50:15.388 --> 50:17.974
With his wife, bags packed.

50:19.017 --> 50:22.311
About to leave you holding the blame.
Your friend, Jorge.

50:23.354 --> 50:25.398
You had your bitch follow me?

50:27.108 --> 50:30.236
- What did you say?
- Me? And my children?

50:31.571 --> 50:34.282
You should be thankful,
motherfucker.

50:35.116 --> 50:39.203
It's why you're standing there...
instead of sitting next to him.

50:41.039 --> 50:43.750
You're making a big mistake, David.

50:43.875 --> 50:46.878
I don't give a fuck what you think.

50:48.212 --> 50:49.881
He's a loyal man.
He always has been.

50:51.049 --> 50:54.010
- He's a piece of shit, Jorge.
- He's a good man and loyal.

50:54.135 --> 50:56.012
- Then why was he running?
- What are you doing?

50:56.137 --> 50:58.556
- This is a good man...
- He's a fucking snitch!

50:58.681 --> 51:00.141
Jorge!

51:11.235 --> 51:12.987
Look at me.

51:13.905 --> 51:15.323
Sophia's inside.

51:16.282 --> 51:18.618
She's inside that room.

51:20.078 --> 51:23.164
Don't let them touch her.
Don't let them put a hand on Sophia.

51:23.289 --> 51:25.625
She has nothing to do with this, brother.

51:25.750 --> 51:27.710
These fucking bastards are crazy...

51:27.835 --> 51:29.253
David, no!

51:34.425 --> 51:36.427
Your friend was right, Jorge.

51:36.552 --> 51:38.387
Go check on Sophia.

52:14.590 --> 52:17.677
My brother is in prison
because we were weak.

52:19.679 --> 52:22.223
Because mistakes were made.

52:24.475 --> 52:29.230
Because we allowed people
to be dishonest with us.

52:33.693 --> 52:36.154
These are the consequences.

52:39.949 --> 52:42.869
Mistakes will not be tolerated.

52:50.626 --> 52:53.796
Jorge, when he tried to run,

52:53.921 --> 52:57.800
he proved he was willing
to turn against us, all of us.

52:59.135 --> 53:02.638
Men with nothing to hide don't run, right?

53:08.477 --> 53:14.901
Now... I trust you can take over
Cordova's responsibilities.

53:17.737 --> 53:22.241
As our new head of security, Jorge.
What do you think?

53:29.665 --> 53:32.877
I'm glad I can count on you.

54:36.357 --> 54:39.777
My little girl, you're going to eat
a little bit of salad, okay?

54:39.902 --> 54:43.281
Vera is going to teach you.
Look how much she ate.

54:43.739 --> 54:46.450
Just a bit, sweetie.
Please, just eat a little bit.

54:46.575 --> 54:50.496
- Hi. I thought you'd be home later.
- Daddy's here!

54:54.208 --> 54:56.002
Give me a minute.

55:38.377 --> 55:41.881
- Peña.
- 'It's me, Christina Jurado.'

55:43.007 --> 55:45.593
I'm glad you called. Are you okay?

55:45.718 --> 55:48.054
Please don't lie to me.

55:48.179 --> 55:50.848
If I do this, if I get my husband to...

55:51.974 --> 55:54.810
You can protect us?
We can go home?

55:54.935 --> 55:56.854
'You have my word.'

56:01.817 --> 56:03.361
I talked to him.

56:04.570 --> 56:09.450
- You did? That's good.
- 'He's gonna... cooperate.'

56:09.575 --> 56:11.243
He said that?

56:11.369 --> 56:15.915
Oh, no, not yet, but he will.
I just... I need a little time.

56:17.708 --> 56:21.670
That's fine.
You take all the time you need.

56:21.796 --> 56:27.843
'Attention passengers:
Now boarding flight 1935 to Curaçao.'

58:43.437 --> 58:45.648
Is that the landline?

58:51.737 --> 58:54.823
- 'Hello?'
- The cartel knows where you are.

59:08.587 --> 59:10.631
'Who is this?'

59:11.549 --> 59:14.093
'I think we can help each other out.'
