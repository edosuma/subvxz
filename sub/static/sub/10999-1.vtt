WEBVTT

00:50.051 --> 00:53.452
Cotton tail,
he was runnin' free.

00:53.454 --> 00:55.320
I just chased it
around the hillside,

00:55.322 --> 00:58.524
and then I wait for him
down in the mud.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.227
It was a fast rabbit.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.495
Hmm. Fast, but dumb.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.298
Don't know when
to keep it's head down.

01:11.372 --> 01:14.139
So there it is, rustling
around the leaves, see,

01:16.610 --> 01:19.111
He think, uh, under the
cover of the brush,

01:19.113 --> 01:21.113
them hawks ain't gonna see him.

01:21.115 --> 01:23.749
Tickling the grass...

01:23.751 --> 01:26.485
Then, bam!

01:26.487 --> 01:28.454
A bullet straight to heaven.

01:29.723 --> 01:34.426
Hmm.

01:34.428 --> 01:37.296
Mm, five big ones, little.

01:40.468 --> 01:41.800
Ruth is my friend.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.305
What'd you say?

01:46.307 --> 01:48.774
You're gonna pay
for your sinnin'.

01:50.211 --> 01:54.379
She told me
she wasn't the first.

01:54.381 --> 01:57.716
First?

01:57.718 --> 01:59.718
She can't tell you nothin'.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.120
Who been talkin' them lies?

02:01.122 --> 02:02.421
Your preacher?

02:10.798 --> 02:13.432
Angels.

02:18.606 --> 02:20.339
Get her, boy.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.842
Rabbit's running.

02:34.388 --> 02:38.590
Go ahead now,
there ain't nowhere safe.

02:38.592 --> 02:41.426
Hawk is gonna find you.

Hi, there.

05:45.713 --> 05:48.814
I reckon you ran
up front side of a nail.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.982
Yeah, I think so.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.918
I tried calling for help, but...

05:52.920 --> 05:55.020
Yeah, that wouldn't work
when you need it to,

05:55.022 --> 05:56.088
now would it?

05:56.090 --> 05:58.523
No, I guess not.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.658
Well, let me have a little look,

05:59.660 --> 06:01.393
take a see what you've got here.

06:01.395 --> 06:03.128
Thank you.

06:04.098 --> 06:05.397
Well, yep.

06:05.399 --> 06:06.431
It's on there.

06:06.433 --> 06:08.533
Yeah, I did my best.

06:11.772 --> 06:14.406
Y'all them folk
what moved up to Caperwood.

06:14.408 --> 06:16.041
Yeah, we are.

06:17.111 --> 06:19.611
It's a good old house.

06:19.613 --> 06:22.114
Good old house.

06:22.116 --> 06:24.015
Yeah, it is.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.486
Far cry from the city, huh?

06:29.656 --> 06:32.090
Yeah, it's beautiful.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.826
Well, along with our
pristine roads,

06:34.828 --> 06:37.429
people say we famous
for our views.

06:37.431 --> 06:38.797
Thank you so much.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.432
- What do I owe you?
- No, ma'am.

06:40.434 --> 06:43.034
No, I could not have
done this myself.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.703
Ah.

06:44.705 --> 06:45.704
You could've.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.172
And you would have too.

06:47.174 --> 06:48.874
Besides, I'd hate to
have to haul you in

06:48.876 --> 06:50.442
for bribing an officer
of the law

06:50.444 --> 06:51.777
before you all even get settled.

06:51.779 --> 06:54.713
Okay.

06:54.715 --> 06:57.182
Thank you again.

06:57.184 --> 07:00.685
Ma'am, excuse me.
What is that right there?

07:00.687 --> 07:03.021
It's a birthmark.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.792
Good day.

07:08.829 --> 07:11.196
Oh, ma'am?

07:11.198 --> 07:12.931
One thing I might should say,

07:12.933 --> 07:15.467
being as y'all
ain't from around here,

07:15.469 --> 07:17.769
not all places fit for visit.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.639
What do you mean?

07:20.641 --> 07:24.042
Well, there's some strange
folk around here.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.044
They made their life on
their own, god bless them,

07:26.046 --> 07:28.079
and they not
be disturbed, is all.

07:49.837 --> 07:52.003
Wh... ah!

08:02.015 --> 08:03.548
Hey, babe.

08:03.550 --> 08:04.983
Hey, sweetie.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.218
Where you been?

08:06.220 --> 08:07.853
Oh, don't ask.

08:07.855 --> 08:08.920
Had a little bit of a disaster.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.555
Hi.

08:10.557 --> 08:12.090
- Mmm.
- I missed you.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.659
Aw. I missed you too.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.995
I blew a tire though, that's
why I'm late. I'm sorry.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.030
Ah, please tell me
you didn't change it.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.600
No.
I actually tried to,

08:21.602 --> 08:22.601
but then a local
came by and helped me.

08:22.603 --> 08:23.802
Oh, wow.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.737
He was a little creepy,
he still did it.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.239
Yeah, and I almost
cut off my finger.

08:27.241 --> 08:28.540
You almost cut off your finger?

08:28.542 --> 08:29.641
Yeah, perils of house work.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.610
Oh, look at you, tough guy.

08:31.612 --> 08:32.611
Yeah, watch out.

08:32.613 --> 08:33.778
Your nails getting dirty.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.013
- Right?
- I like it.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.982
So, uh, what are
you making tonight?

08:37.985 --> 08:40.051
Uh, I was gonna
make something called,

08:40.053 --> 08:42.020
"my husband's making
dinner for me."

08:48.896 --> 08:50.061
Job well done today.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.997
Yeah, thanks.

08:51.999 --> 08:55.901
We're like, 20% done.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.903
I think we're finally
where we need to be.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.905
This really feels like home.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.873
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.631
Ah!

09:26.633 --> 09:28.300
Hi!

09:28.302 --> 09:30.035
Oh, it's so good to see you.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.269
Great to see you.
This is Dave.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.171
Hi, Dave.
Sarah.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.739
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.675
Thank you for coming.
This is my husband.

09:36.677 --> 09:37.676
- Matt.
- How are you doing? Dave.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.110
Yeah, pleasure.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.712
- You...
- I know, I'm huge.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.614
I'm huge.

09:42.616 --> 09:44.649
Come here, come on,
I wanna show you.

09:44.651 --> 09:47.018
Oh my god, I'm so jealous.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.887
Oh, don't be, please.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.722
It's yours anytime.
You just say the word.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.591
Well, it's actually the bank's.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.893
But, lest let facts get in the way.

09:54.895 --> 09:55.961
And this one too, of course,

09:55.963 --> 09:56.962
if he plays his cards right.

09:56.964 --> 09:57.963
Oh, okay.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.631
No pressure.

09:59.633 --> 10:02.934
So... this is where
we're gonna do it.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.302
Uh... do it?

10:04.304 --> 10:06.037
Yeah, that's where
the magic happens.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.973
Yeah, we've already
got the midwife,

10:07.975 --> 10:10.809
and of course, my favorite
doctor is going to be on-call.

10:10.811 --> 10:13.178
Oh, so you're giving birth here?

10:13.180 --> 10:14.746
That's the plan,
fingers crossed.

10:14.748 --> 10:17.716
You guys, this
is really wonderful

10:17.718 --> 10:19.351
I'm... I'm really
excited for you guys.

10:19.353 --> 10:22.087
Thank you.
We're pretty happy.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.089
Okay, I wanna show you the
rest of the house. Come here.

10:24.091 --> 10:26.057
- Excuse us.
- Thank you.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.292
You, sir?
Thirsty?

10:27.294 --> 10:28.994
Absolutely.

10:28.996 --> 10:31.229
Oh, he's really cute.

10:31.231 --> 10:35.033
My god. Yeah,
yeah, well done.

10:35.035 --> 10:38.003
So, any tips for a new local?

10:38.005 --> 10:39.838
Oh, uh, soda's fine.

10:39.840 --> 10:40.972
Okay.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.174
Uh, sorry, tips for a local?

10:43.176 --> 10:45.043
Yeah, Sarah says
you grew up around here.

10:45.045 --> 10:47.245
Oh, more like 50 miles
south, closer to the city.

10:47.247 --> 10:50.115
Oh, yeah, it's a different
world out here.

10:50.117 --> 10:52.217
Yeah, it's interesting.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.186
I hear you play football.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.389
Used to. Had a ride
back at state,

10:57.391 --> 10:58.957
till I threw my back out.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.291
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear about that.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.060
- And now?
- Personal trainer.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.061
Play a little touch
on the weekends,

11:03.063 --> 11:04.663
if I'm feeling frisky.

11:04.665 --> 11:07.098
Oh, nice. Yeah,
back trauma's no joke.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.768
And the list gets scarier
with football players.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.302
Count your blessings.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.371
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

11:13.373 --> 11:16.174
So, how long has it been
since you've seen them, then?

11:16.176 --> 11:17.876
Every other month or so, maybe.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.711
- I don't know.
- That's great.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.913
That means this medicine's
actually working then.

11:21.915 --> 11:25.116
Yeah, I mean I'm not... I'm not
gonna embarrass you, or anything,

11:25.118 --> 11:26.885
if that's what
you're worried about.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.354
No. That is not... you have
never embarrassed me.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.389
- That's not what I meant at all.
- I know.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.091
You know, I've had my own
issues with seeing things.

11:33.093 --> 11:37.162
I know, I know.
It's just... it's just weird.

11:37.164 --> 11:38.963
You live with these people
since you're a kid,

11:38.965 --> 11:41.099
and then, a doctor comes along,

11:41.101 --> 11:42.400
and tells you
that they're not real.

11:42.402 --> 11:43.702
That it doesn't exist,

11:43.704 --> 11:45.070
and to take this medicine,

11:45.072 --> 11:46.304
and it's gonna make
you all better.

11:46.306 --> 11:50.041
And... and then
everyone's gone.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.243
I'm not gone.
I'm not going anywhere.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.912
Matt's not going anywhere.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.313
Dave seems pretty real.

11:55.315 --> 11:59.050
I mean, that guy...
Wow, he seems really real.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.885
I think I really like him.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.007
Good, I'm really looking
forward to getting to know...

12:07.494 --> 12:09.761
No fucking way.

12:09.763 --> 12:11.863
Whoo! Nice digs!

12:15.836 --> 12:17.969
This place is sick.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.170
Hey.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.406
What the hell, stranger?

12:21.408 --> 12:23.374
Ah, you know,
I figured you invited us,

12:23.376 --> 12:25.043
and what kind of
uncle would I be

12:25.045 --> 12:26.478
if I didn't show up?

12:26.480 --> 12:28.413
Hi.

12:28.415 --> 12:31.249
I did invite you. That was
about five months ago though,

12:31.251 --> 12:32.917
and you were supposed to RSVP.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.953
Well, if RSVP means show up
with dirty laundry,

12:34.955 --> 12:36.955
then we did just that.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.757
- That's exactly what it means.
- Yeah.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.525
Hey, I want you to meet
the Pearl of my life.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.494
This is Skye. Skye,
this is my sister, Sarah.

12:42.496 --> 12:44.996
- Hey, god you are gorgeous.
- Oh, thank you.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.765
Dude, thank you
for letting us crash.

12:46.767 --> 12:49.134
- So cool of you.
- You are so welcome.

12:49.136 --> 12:52.437
And this right here
is Sabrina the teenage Bruja.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.872
All grown up.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.106
Hey, it looks like
you've come a long way.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.274
Hi, thank you very much.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.842
Yeah, that is ours right there.

12:57.844 --> 12:58.843
- We love her. Don't we?
- Mm-hmm.

12:58.845 --> 13:00.044
You own it, huh?

13:00.046 --> 13:01.346
Is that doctor Matt over there?

13:01.348 --> 13:02.480
Hey, we're gonna go
get cleaned up

13:02.482 --> 13:04.215
real quick, all right?

13:04.217 --> 13:05.884
What's for lunch, bud?

13:07.554 --> 13:09.854
You don't have to worry
about embarrassing me now,

13:09.856 --> 13:11.956
because my brother's here.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.360
Hi.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.132
Hey, hey...
White wine?

13:21.134 --> 13:22.867
Oh, no, this is apple juice.

13:22.869 --> 13:26.204
I just like to pretend.

13:26.206 --> 13:27.472
Oh, rad.
What kind of clothes?

13:27.474 --> 13:29.007
Uh, casual work wear,

13:29.009 --> 13:30.575
that's what I call it anyway.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.377
It's like, light wools
and stitched patterns.

13:32.379 --> 13:36.514
- Cool. Like um, this?
- Yeah, like this, actually.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.349
Nice, I like it.

13:38.351 --> 13:41.219
So, you really think
I'd enjoy burning man?

13:41.221 --> 13:44.422
Bro, would you enjoy

13:44.424 --> 13:47.325
the true freedom of the mind?

13:47.327 --> 13:48.560
Yeah, it's a good little clinic.

13:48.562 --> 13:50.461
Only about 20 intakes a day.

13:50.463 --> 13:52.063
Well, that'll be a change.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.565
Yeah, I can't wait.

13:53.567 --> 13:55.333
See the life's good
good for your 20s,

13:55.335 --> 13:57.135
but after it gets
a little crazy.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.437
Well, it's perfect for you guys.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.372
Yeah, we've been just like, traveling
around for the last six months.

14:01.374 --> 14:03.508
Yeah, Eric said
like Oregon, Arizona.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.043
Oh, Arizona was amazing.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.312
The red rocks are so groovy.

14:07.314 --> 14:10.114
We're trying to get down to the golf
coast for summer. Those cute towns.

14:10.116 --> 14:11.950
- Cute towns.
- Yes, those cute towns.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.352
- I wanna see them.
- So cute.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.187
- Oh, I like your charm.
- Oh, right on, yeah.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.056
I got this at this
little flea market

14:18.058 --> 14:19.557
in Tahoma, you know?

14:19.559 --> 14:21.960
And it kinda like...

14:21.962 --> 14:24.429
Well, it kinda drew us
here, you know?

14:24.431 --> 14:26.531
Have you been out
to the woods yet?

14:26.533 --> 14:30.101
Oh, no, we haven't had time yet.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.703
Does the doctor
not want to pitch a tent?

14:32.606 --> 14:34.505
Do you guys need anything?

14:34.507 --> 14:35.573
- No, I'm good, baby.
- All right.

14:35.575 --> 14:37.141
I'm good, thank you.

14:38.612 --> 14:40.478
- How great is she?
- Yeah.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.880
Yeah, she seems really sweet.

14:41.882 --> 14:43.114
She is.

14:43.116 --> 14:46.050
When are you planning
on getting home?

14:46.052 --> 14:49.420
Well, this is it.

14:49.422 --> 14:52.223
Oh, come on, don't... don't
give me that look. All right?

14:52.225 --> 14:54.125
I'm not trying to move
into your big house

14:54.127 --> 14:55.560
with too many rooms.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.562
Our home is this slab
that we rolled in on.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.330
That's our home now.

14:59.332 --> 15:03.034
- You're gonna live in the Van?
- Yeah.

15:03.036 --> 15:06.137
Yeah, I mean, besides,
we can't really, um,

15:06.139 --> 15:07.939
we can't really go back
to the apartment, you know,

15:07.941 --> 15:10.074
we haven't paid rent
since like, November.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.243
But, no, but... the walls
were getting small,

15:12.245 --> 15:14.379
- and it was... it was really
like... -Jesus, Eric.

15:14.381 --> 15:15.914
I don't know,
the energy wasn't there.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.115
- You know?
- Okay.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.616
Have you thought
about getting a job?

15:18.618 --> 15:21.119
Yeah. Yeah, I mean...

15:21.121 --> 15:22.687
I don't know, you know,

15:22.689 --> 15:24.522
it's like...
Life is about living,

15:24.524 --> 15:26.491
you know? Living.

15:26.493 --> 15:29.627
Yeah, living takes money, Eric.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.462
Food, gas.

15:31.464 --> 15:34.565
We'll be all right.
I always am, you know that.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.200
Ahem.

15:36.202 --> 15:37.936
Look at you, grill master.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.637
Yeah, it's actually all local.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.172
- Yeah? Cool.
- Yeah.

15:41.174 --> 15:44.175
- Would you like one?
- Uh,

15:44.177 --> 15:45.710
- I'm actually a veg.
- You're a veg.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.378
- Yeah. -Damn, I wish
I would have known.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.947
- No, dude, it's cool.
- No, hold tight.

15:48.949 --> 15:51.449
Um, I think I might
have something for you.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.951
Don't like go out of your
way for me, or anything.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.485
Not a problem.

15:54.487 --> 15:55.653
I hope that that's enough

15:55.655 --> 15:57.221
to carry you for a little bit.

15:57.223 --> 15:58.323
Oh, babe, it's more than enough.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.091
Thank you.

16:00.093 --> 16:02.427
Babe, do you have
any of that pasta left?

16:02.429 --> 16:03.995
Hey, you need a beer,
or something?

16:03.997 --> 16:08.366
- Uh, I'm good.
- All right.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.035
Really?

16:12.339 --> 16:14.205
What am I supposed to do?

16:23.750 --> 16:26.284
This is such
a quaint little spread.

16:26.286 --> 16:28.019
Who would have thought
that big city elitism

16:28.021 --> 16:29.654
would travel so cool
to the country, huh?

16:29.656 --> 16:31.456
Yeah, well,
that big city elitism

16:31.458 --> 16:34.525
is financing your dirtbag life.

16:34.527 --> 16:37.495
Hey, so, uh, Matt, I see you
still got dad's old Jeep.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.364
Yeah, it's a work horse.

16:39.366 --> 16:42.100
Hauled some brush off the
road with it last weekend.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.202
I always thought that
doctor's all drove Audis.

16:44.204 --> 16:47.405
- You know?
- Well, this doctor doesn't.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.307
But that's just because
he's made some sacrifices

16:49.309 --> 16:51.242
for me and our family.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.478
The baby is the only thing
that matters to us.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.446
Probably the rest of it
will come in time.

16:55.448 --> 16:58.082
Audi's included, okay?

16:58.084 --> 17:00.184
Does anybody mind
if I freshen up?

17:00.186 --> 17:02.620
It's been, like, a lot
longer than I care to admit.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.122
Yeah, yeah,
you can come in, here.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.558
There you go.

17:52.472 --> 17:54.806
Hey, uh, you okay?

17:54.808 --> 17:57.542
Uh, yeah, yeah.

17:57.544 --> 17:59.644
I think I just fell asleep.

18:08.354 --> 18:09.620
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.823
I heard her scream,
I went to help.

18:11.825 --> 18:15.660
I didn't think she was
gonna be half naked.

18:15.662 --> 18:18.296
Well, you didn't seem
to mind either.

18:18.298 --> 18:22.233
Well, I was checking
on our guest.

18:22.235 --> 18:25.203
What's your deal?

18:26.473 --> 18:30.274
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.610
I've been having these
really weird thoughts lately

18:32.612 --> 18:35.646
about us, and the move,
and the baby, and...

18:35.648 --> 18:38.850
It's okay. We're fine.

18:40.487 --> 18:41.886
Sit down.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.128
You know the baby is perfect.

18:50.130 --> 18:53.698
Every test we've done,
every sonogram,

18:53.700 --> 18:57.268
they've all said the same thing.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.704
- I just...
- Yeah, you just what?

18:59.706 --> 19:03.274
I don't know how to explain it.

19:06.279 --> 19:09.547
When I was on
the road yesterday,

19:09.549 --> 19:12.250
the trees, and the clouds,

19:12.252 --> 19:16.187
and there were these
wildflowers everywhere.

19:16.189 --> 19:20.424
And things just, they move
so quickly, you know?

19:21.728 --> 19:24.362
Time just passes, and life is...

19:24.364 --> 19:27.765
It's so precious,
it's so fragile.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.767
It's like, it's gone so quickly.

19:29.769 --> 19:32.303
Hey, look at me.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.804
We're the lucky ones.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.842
Other people, they,
they go through life,

19:37.844 --> 19:40.244
and they don't have
what we have.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.681
We're strong

19:43.683 --> 19:45.883
because we have each other.

19:45.885 --> 19:47.885
I know.

19:49.522 --> 19:52.423
I just want her to life
a long happy life.

19:52.425 --> 19:55.193
Yeah, well she will.
I promise.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.662
I will personally
make sure of it.

20:00.934 --> 20:03.801
I just love her
so much, you know?

20:03.803 --> 20:06.204
Yeah.

20:06.206 --> 20:08.606
I would do anything for her.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.978
Everything's gonna be fine.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.748
I know.

20:18.985 --> 20:22.320
It was a man.

20:22.322 --> 20:24.555
What kind of man?

20:24.557 --> 20:29.360
Dark hair, beard...
Long beard.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.362
Eyes like fire.

20:31.364 --> 20:32.997
Eyes like fire?

20:32.999 --> 20:34.599
Did he say anything to you?

20:34.601 --> 20:36.834
No.

20:36.836 --> 20:39.337
Did you say anything to him?

20:39.339 --> 20:41.672
Mm. No, I don't think so.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.541
I don't really remember.

20:45.278 --> 20:46.877
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

20:46.879 --> 20:49.614
Okay, copy that.

20:49.616 --> 20:50.681
I'm gonna give you
a pass this time.

20:50.683 --> 20:53.684
But this is...

20:53.686 --> 20:55.286
This is some good stuff.

21:26.486 --> 21:29.520
"The angels visited
again last night.

21:29.522 --> 21:30.621
They talked to me.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.556
I wasn't scared."

21:47.940 --> 21:49.774
Nice night for a walk.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.827
All right, here it goes.

22:10.963 --> 22:13.064
You got it.

22:19.505 --> 22:21.439
Yeah, right?

22:21.441 --> 22:23.908
And the game is over.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.510
Okay, you do it.
I'll watch.

22:26.512 --> 22:28.012
Eric.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.816
Ready? Ready?

22:31.818 --> 22:33.584
Oh, shit, sorry.

22:33.586 --> 22:34.785
- Outside.
- It's good.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.520
- Wow.
- My bad.

22:36.522 --> 22:39.590
I just wanted more time to kiss.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.000
Hey!

22:51.604 --> 22:53.738
Right there.
Under the vines.

22:58.911 --> 23:01.412
One surprise after another.

23:01.414 --> 23:03.748
Yeah, you guys
live on a cemetery,

23:03.750 --> 23:05.483
that's awesome.

23:05.485 --> 23:06.851
It's not a cemetery,
it's a plot.

23:06.853 --> 23:10.454
My god, Matt, she was so young.

23:10.456 --> 23:11.655
All right, guys, come on,

23:11.657 --> 23:13.424
I know this is a bummer, right?

23:13.426 --> 23:17.128
But, hey, we're alive,
so we should live.

23:17.130 --> 23:18.496
We're here to have fun,
I mean we showed up.

23:18.498 --> 23:19.797
She's not going anywhere.

23:19.799 --> 23:21.065
You can come back
and visit her later.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.033
Come on, first one
to the beer wins!

23:34.514 --> 23:37.748
So, we check into the haunted
hotel in Portland, right?

23:37.750 --> 23:40.618
And I guess, like, the ninth
floor is the most haunted.

23:40.620 --> 23:43.921
And so, what floor do they
put us on, but the ninth.

23:43.923 --> 23:46.991
- -You really
believe that crap?

23:46.993 --> 23:51.195
Dude, all along the coast, we stopped
at these plantations to hunt.

23:51.197 --> 23:52.596
To hunt?

23:52.598 --> 23:53.731
For ghosts.

23:53.733 --> 23:54.999
Oh, yeah, right.

23:55.001 --> 23:56.834
- Seriously, bro.
- Oh, no, seriously.

23:56.836 --> 23:57.968
No, let me show you.

24:00.740 --> 24:02.606
- Boom.
- What's that?

24:02.608 --> 24:04.575
Ah, E.V.P. Recorder.

24:04.577 --> 24:06.444
It stands for
"electronic voice phenomena."

24:06.446 --> 24:10.514
- And you use that to...
- To hunt ghosts.

24:10.516 --> 24:12.983
- Oh.
- Laugh if you want,

24:12.985 --> 24:14.652
but I'm telling you,

24:14.654 --> 24:16.554
have you guys ever been
into slave quarters before?

24:16.556 --> 24:17.888
It's crazy. Okay?

24:17.890 --> 24:19.590
They got these like,
four foot ceilings,

24:19.592 --> 24:21.926
and they got these like
chains hanging off the walls,

24:21.928 --> 24:23.794
and I'm telling you,
you can feel it.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.464
I mean, these spirits,
they want to be heard.

24:26.466 --> 24:27.865
You hear them?

24:27.867 --> 24:30.968
Yeah.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.537
Take a listen.

24:36.576 --> 24:37.875
Eric.

24:37.877 --> 24:40.110
Hey.

24:40.112 --> 24:41.545
Oh, sorry.

24:46.519 --> 24:48.686
What the hell is this?

24:48.688 --> 24:50.154
- You don't hear it?
- Well, no, I hear it,

24:50.156 --> 24:52.223
I just don't hear... it.

24:53.926 --> 24:55.726
You're not listening, bro.

24:55.728 --> 24:59.163
Yeah, bro. Well, I'm done
listening for today.

24:59.165 --> 25:02.166
If you don't believe me,
ask Sarah.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.601
Ask her what?

25:03.603 --> 25:04.668
Ask her if she
believes in ghosts.

25:04.670 --> 25:06.237
Stop it, Eric.

25:06.239 --> 25:07.738
What?

25:09.041 --> 25:12.843
You... you've
never told him?

25:12.845 --> 25:15.212
Tell me what?

25:15.214 --> 25:16.580
When we were kids...

25:16.582 --> 25:18.716
Stop.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.718
When you were kids, what?

25:23.589 --> 25:26.957
When we were kids, there
were ghosts in our house.

25:26.959 --> 25:29.660
Were there?

25:29.662 --> 25:33.130
It was two days before our sixth
birthday, and they came for us.

25:39.305 --> 25:40.704
They came for you?

25:42.875 --> 25:44.575
Yeah.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.312
And you know what saved us?

25:58.024 --> 26:00.591
Butterflies?

26:03.796 --> 26:06.130
What happened
happened, all right?

26:06.132 --> 26:07.831
There's no reason to deny it.

26:10.870 --> 26:12.169
Don't be a dick, Eric.

26:12.171 --> 26:13.771
I'm not trying to be a dick.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.940
I'm sorry, I didn't...
Sarah, come on.

26:19.345 --> 26:20.744
You know, it's hard to believe

26:20.746 --> 26:23.280
that she's related to you.

26:23.282 --> 26:24.882
Why's that?

26:24.884 --> 26:26.250
Well, for one thing,
she's loving,

26:26.252 --> 26:28.686
she's kind, considerate...

26:28.688 --> 26:31.989
Pretty much all the
things that you're not.

26:31.991 --> 26:34.992
Wow.

26:34.994 --> 26:38.896
Well, I guess everybody has to
have their opposite, right?

26:41.167 --> 26:43.968
That's probably why
she chose you.

27:11.831 --> 27:13.797
There is some good ghost fodder

27:13.799 --> 27:15.366
up in these mountains.

27:15.368 --> 27:17.234
Yeah?
What do you mean?

27:17.236 --> 27:19.637
There was a serial killer
back in the 70s.

27:19.639 --> 27:20.871
Who?

27:20.873 --> 27:22.039
Newspapers called him,
"cannibal Kane."

27:22.041 --> 27:23.974
Said he mutilated his victims,

27:23.976 --> 27:25.342
then ate them.

27:25.344 --> 27:28.045
Some weird satanic
something-or-other.

27:28.047 --> 27:31.181
- They caught him, right? -Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:31.183 --> 27:34.118
Creepy to know that there's people
like that in jail getting old like us.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.653
Well, not anymore.

27:35.655 --> 27:36.754
Well, he got out?

27:36.756 --> 27:38.722
No, no, no, no.

27:38.724 --> 27:40.090
He died.

27:40.092 --> 27:41.825
The prisons burned down
back in the 80s.

27:41.827 --> 27:44.194
It was like, this big
story around here.

27:44.196 --> 27:47.731
Something like 100 people
were trapped inside,

27:47.733 --> 27:49.333
- died in their cell.
- We need to check that out.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.068
- Yeah, we do.
- What?

27:51.070 --> 27:52.302
Yeah, it's a perfect night,

27:52.304 --> 27:53.771
a full moon.

27:53.773 --> 27:55.239
Oh, excuse me.

27:55.241 --> 27:57.374
Wait, you want to take us
to a burnt out prison

27:57.376 --> 27:58.409
in the middle of no where,

27:58.411 --> 27:59.843
- yeah.
- At night,

27:59.845 --> 28:01.178
because it's a full moon?

28:01.180 --> 28:03.013
Somehow a full moon
makes that a good idea?

28:03.015 --> 28:04.882
If you wanna go now,
there's still daylight left.

28:04.884 --> 28:06.750
But, um, the only thing is

28:06.752 --> 28:08.952
that the ghosts
don't come out until night.

28:08.954 --> 28:11.755
Oh that's right, that's in
your ghost hunting manual, right?

28:11.757 --> 28:14.892
I... I have always
wanted to see that place.

28:14.894 --> 28:17.261
- I'm sorry, what?
- I...

28:17.263 --> 28:19.063
I say we go, it'll be fun.
Come on, Bree.

28:19.065 --> 28:20.264
In high school,
all the kids used to go,

28:20.266 --> 28:21.699
it was like a dare.
Kinda like,

28:21.701 --> 28:23.333
make out in the prison,
kind of thing.

28:23.335 --> 28:25.169
Ah.

28:25.171 --> 28:27.271
We could make some more
recordings added to the box.

28:27.273 --> 28:28.706
Yes.

28:28.708 --> 28:31.241
- I don't wanna do this.
- Come on.

28:31.243 --> 28:32.376
It'll be fun.
Where's fun, Bree?

28:32.378 --> 28:34.478
Let's go.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.747
How about you, Matt?

28:36.749 --> 28:38.082
You game?

28:38.084 --> 28:39.850
Come on.

28:39.852 --> 28:40.851
Come on, if there's no ghosts,

28:40.853 --> 28:42.886
it's no big deal, right?

28:42.888 --> 28:45.389
You serious?
Okay, uh, I'm in.

28:45.391 --> 28:46.990
- Yeah
- yes.

28:46.992 --> 28:49.993
- Wow. -Baby, it's
cool, it's fun.

28:49.995 --> 28:51.929
It's no big deal.

28:53.032 --> 28:54.898
A little adventure.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.834
Hey.

28:56.836 --> 28:58.368
Hey, where's that old
crappy sweater I love?

28:58.370 --> 29:00.170
Why are you doing this?

29:00.172 --> 29:02.740
- It's gonna get cold.
- That's not what I mean.

29:02.742 --> 29:05.809
What the hell was he talking
about with the butterflies?

29:05.811 --> 29:08.011
Well, it's just Eric.

29:08.013 --> 29:09.947
I mean, I don't know, they
probably just nested in the house,

29:09.949 --> 29:12.282
and then got out,
go into our room somehow.

29:12.284 --> 29:13.484
Look, he tells
his bullshit stories,

29:13.486 --> 29:15.052
and he travels around the world

29:15.054 --> 29:17.020
pissing away our money,
and I'm over it.

29:17.022 --> 29:20.190
Now, this shit?
Ghosts? Butterflies?

29:20.192 --> 29:21.425
Really?

29:21.427 --> 29:22.926
Oh, you never shared
that with me.

29:22.928 --> 29:26.296
I want you brother out of here.

29:26.298 --> 29:29.767
Can you keep your
voice down, please?

29:29.769 --> 29:32.903
I'm sorry about the check.
I should have said something.

29:32.905 --> 29:36.106
Yeah, well, it's...
It's bigger than the check.

29:36.108 --> 29:37.541
It's everything.

29:37.543 --> 29:39.910
Not responding
to your e-mails,

29:39.912 --> 29:41.845
blowing off your phone calls,

29:41.847 --> 29:44.414
and now the random showing up
to crash whenever he wants?

29:44.416 --> 29:46.083
Telling more bullshit stories

29:46.085 --> 29:47.484
that are obviously
bothering you.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.086
Well, how is this helping?

29:50.422 --> 29:52.523
I wanna see what he sees,

29:52.525 --> 29:55.025
and call bullshit on it.

29:55.027 --> 29:58.395
Finally chip away and this... this myth
he's built his entire life around.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.798
He's not your responsibility.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.966
Yeah, well, you are.

30:02.968 --> 30:05.836
And you're gonna be
the mother of our child.

30:05.838 --> 30:08.205
Even though you were born
two minutes before he was,

30:08.207 --> 30:11.041
you've been playing
big sister for way too long.

30:11.043 --> 30:12.376
He's got to grow up.

30:14.346 --> 30:16.013
It starts today.

30:26.125 --> 30:28.158
That sweater?

30:30.563 --> 30:31.829
Thanks.

31:09.501 --> 31:11.602
Come back in an hour?

31:26.252 --> 31:29.987
You know, someday you're gonna
realize that this isn't a mistake.

31:29.989 --> 31:32.122
What isn't a mistake?

31:32.124 --> 31:33.624
Who we are.

31:33.626 --> 31:35.125
The things we seen.

31:35.127 --> 31:37.628
The things that
we've been shown.

31:37.630 --> 31:39.496
Sarah, you and I have a gift.

31:39.498 --> 31:41.198
Oh, I do have a gift.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.332
And you've managed
to convince him

31:42.334 --> 31:44.334
to take this stupid hike.

31:44.336 --> 31:45.669
And if anything happens to him,

31:45.671 --> 31:47.137
I will kill you

31:47.139 --> 31:48.405
with my bare hands.

31:49.675 --> 31:53.143
Yes, ma'am.
See ya later.

32:18.037 --> 32:19.436
Dave, uh...

32:19.438 --> 32:20.938
You really know
where we're going?

32:20.940 --> 32:22.940
Kinda...

32:22.942 --> 32:23.942
Oh, my god!

32:28.514 --> 32:30.580
That's really not cool.

32:30.582 --> 32:31.949
You should have seen your face,

32:31.951 --> 32:33.083
oh, my god that was hilarious.

32:33.085 --> 32:35.652
Don't do that again.

32:42.027 --> 32:43.527
Here.

32:49.201 --> 32:51.668
Why the hell would anybody
build a prison out here?

32:51.670 --> 32:53.236
Why not?

32:53.238 --> 32:57.274
Probably safer out here
than Alcatraz.

32:57.276 --> 32:59.977
How the hell would you find
your way out of this place?

33:19.365 --> 33:21.365
- Welcome to prison.
- Holy shit.

33:21.367 --> 33:23.133
Shut up.

33:25.170 --> 33:28.005
Unbelievable.

33:56.135 --> 34:00.037
I say we divide and conquer.

34:07.780 --> 34:11.248
Wow.

34:12.451 --> 34:14.217
- This place...
- It's insane.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.485
It just keeps going.

34:18.056 --> 34:21.324
Hey. Look what I got.

34:21.326 --> 34:23.427
Look at you, prepared.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.679
Ah, yes.

34:42.681 --> 34:45.415
This place goes on
for miles and...

34:45.417 --> 34:46.716
Oh, god, oh, jeez!

34:46.717 --> 34:49.853
- Jesus, not funny!
- Come on.

34:54.760 --> 34:57.127
Is that good?

34:57.129 --> 34:59.496
Let's go get this
cannibal motherfucker.

35:05.604 --> 35:07.170
You ready?

35:07.172 --> 35:08.572
You know I am.

36:16.408 --> 36:17.707
Help me.

36:35.894 --> 36:38.495
This is gonna be good.

36:38.497 --> 36:41.231
No, no, no.

36:41.233 --> 36:42.799
What, did you smoke too much?

36:42.801 --> 36:45.202
Uh, yeah, I think so.

36:46.738 --> 36:48.238
Hey, we don't have
much time left

36:48.240 --> 36:49.606
to go down here, come on.

36:49.608 --> 36:52.409
Yeah, I don't...
I don't want to.

36:52.411 --> 36:54.611
Hey, Skye, babe,
this is what we came for,

36:54.613 --> 36:57.747
- right here. -Yeah, I'm just...
I'm not feeling it, baby.

36:57.749 --> 37:01.351
Come on. Hey, I'm not gonna
let anything happen to you.

37:01.353 --> 37:02.793
I'm gonna take
real good care of you.

37:04.590 --> 37:05.822
All right, all right.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.325
Yeah.

37:08.327 --> 37:09.492
All right.
Come on.

37:24.343 --> 37:26.376
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

37:37.589 --> 37:40.423
You're so strong.

38:35.447 --> 38:37.614
All clear.

38:39.985 --> 38:41.384
Okay.

38:41.386 --> 38:43.953
Oh, this is the old mess hall.

38:43.955 --> 38:45.622
Okay, I'm done.

38:45.624 --> 38:47.691
We can go. We've seen this,
right?

38:47.693 --> 38:49.359
Hey, it's just an old building,

38:49.361 --> 38:51.461
there's nothing
you need to be scared of.

38:51.463 --> 38:53.697
- Okay?
- All right.

38:53.699 --> 38:55.899
I just wanna go.
I'm just done.

38:55.901 --> 38:57.467
Okay, all right.

39:02.641 --> 39:05.842
- No!
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.944
Hey.

39:07.946 --> 39:10.080
Baby, are you okay?

39:10.082 --> 39:13.450
Baby, you all right?

39:14.619 --> 39:17.454
Wh... um, what...
What are those?

39:17.456 --> 39:18.688
It's nothing.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.857
Hey, look at me.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.525
Can we go now?

39:25.764 --> 39:28.665
No fucking way.

39:30.535 --> 39:31.935
Whoa.

39:33.705 --> 39:34.971
This is it.

39:34.973 --> 39:37.607
This is where
those prisoners died.

39:37.609 --> 39:39.776
This is fucking it.

39:40.946 --> 39:43.113
You here with us, Kane?

39:45.884 --> 39:47.650
Kane, are you here?

39:53.992 --> 39:55.825
Wait.

39:59.931 --> 40:01.664
What the hell is that?

40:06.004 --> 40:08.938
I've read about these people
up in the mountains.

40:08.940 --> 40:11.408
They developed their own
kind of religion.

40:11.410 --> 40:13.910
Some sort of demonology

40:13.912 --> 40:15.712
based on voodoo and Christianity

40:15.714 --> 40:18.415
and oral traditions
all combined.

40:18.417 --> 40:19.749
"Sirrahana."

40:23.522 --> 40:25.722
Maybe Sirrahana's their savior.

40:25.724 --> 40:29.592
More like their devil.
Baby, look at this.

40:35.801 --> 40:37.600
"The lost return...

40:37.602 --> 40:39.469
Awakening of the dead

40:39.471 --> 40:41.104
and the end begins.

40:41.106 --> 40:42.205
Drawing the devil

40:42.207 --> 40:43.706
from out of the cycle."

40:43.708 --> 40:44.774
Hello?

40:49.147 --> 40:50.847
- Jesus. I don't like this, Eric.
- Calm down.

40:50.849 --> 40:53.049
This isn't like anything
we've ever experienced.

40:53.051 --> 40:55.485
- Please can we just go? -It's
just our friends trying to play...

40:55.487 --> 40:57.754
I don't fucking care, this place
gives me the creeps, all right?

40:57.756 --> 40:59.189
Take some photos to prove
we were here, and let's go.

40:59.191 --> 41:01.524
Okay. Okay.

41:02.894 --> 41:05.562
I love you.

41:05.564 --> 41:07.831
I love you too.

41:16.875 --> 41:18.107
You better.

41:56.548 --> 41:57.547
Eric!

41:57.549 --> 41:58.748
Oh, my god.

41:58.750 --> 41:59.916
What the fuck?
Eric.

41:59.918 --> 42:02.819
Hey, hey, hey...
I need your help!

42:02.821 --> 42:05.588
Holy shit.
Take him to a hospital.

42:05.590 --> 42:06.589
I can't, he's gonna bleed out.

42:06.591 --> 42:08.925
Get off of him!

42:08.927 --> 42:12.095
You're killing him. Please,
you're killing him.

42:12.097 --> 42:13.796
You're killing him!
Eric!

42:13.798 --> 42:15.231
Hold up, hold up.

42:15.233 --> 42:16.900
Hang on, hang on.

42:18.570 --> 42:19.569
I got you, man.

42:19.571 --> 42:21.137
Relax.

42:21.139 --> 42:22.839
Calm down.

42:42.827 --> 42:43.927
He just stopped bleeding.

42:43.929 --> 42:45.261
I don't understand, dude.

42:45.263 --> 42:46.663
We just gotta get out of here.

42:46.665 --> 42:52.035
Sarah should be waiting for us.

42:52.037 --> 42:54.637
I still think it's safer
in here than out there.

42:54.639 --> 42:55.738
What the fuck do you mean?

42:56.908 --> 42:58.207
Did you not see
what just happened?

42:58.209 --> 43:00.710
Matt, I lived it.

43:00.712 --> 43:02.078
The only difference
between you and me,

43:02.080 --> 43:03.947
is that I don't want
to run from it.

43:03.949 --> 43:06.749
The difference is you're
fucking insane. Okay?

43:06.751 --> 43:08.151
The side effect is
you don't want to run.

43:08.153 --> 43:11.287
Stop fighting.

43:11.289 --> 43:13.923
Am I all alone here? Does anyone
else see how fucking insane this is?

43:13.925 --> 43:15.258
I'm ready to go home.

43:15.260 --> 43:16.893
There's something
down there, guys.

43:16.895 --> 43:18.328
It wants to be heard.

43:18.330 --> 43:20.830
It wants us to hear it.
Don't you get that?

43:20.832 --> 43:23.733
You wanna stick around with a couple
of flashlights, find out what it is?

43:23.735 --> 43:25.168
- Eric, please.
- Okay, yeah.

43:25.170 --> 43:26.903
- We're going.
- I'm not going.

43:26.905 --> 43:27.937
Baby, whatever's down there,

43:27.939 --> 43:30.807
it's not going anywhere.

43:32.310 --> 43:34.711
- Hey.
- Fine, fine.

43:37.148 --> 43:39.882
We're coming back.
Okay?

44:15.086 --> 44:16.853
Thank you so much.

44:16.855 --> 44:19.656
I need to get to
a hospital immediately.

44:19.658 --> 44:21.378
I did not think
that anybody was gonna stop.

44:25.664 --> 44:27.997
You was saying?

44:27.999 --> 44:31.234
Yeah, um...

44:31.236 --> 44:33.269
I was just saying thank you.

44:33.271 --> 44:36.272
Thank you so much.

44:36.274 --> 44:38.908
Nice night for a walk.

44:38.910 --> 44:42.245
Yeah.

45:21.986 --> 45:23.786
What the f...

45:23.788 --> 45:25.021
Oh, no. No, no, no...

45:25.023 --> 45:26.355
How the hell
did we get back here?

45:26.357 --> 45:28.291
Like, I don't know, all right?

45:28.293 --> 45:30.026
- Will you just please... -everybody
please, just chill out, okay?

45:30.028 --> 45:31.894
What's going on?

45:31.896 --> 45:33.229
Maybe there's
something in that book.

45:33.231 --> 45:34.711
What are you talking about?
What book?

45:36.468 --> 45:38.268
What? Do you guys know
something that I don't?

45:39.137 --> 45:41.404
What book?

45:41.406 --> 45:43.439
Here, take it.

45:49.247 --> 45:51.013
"To write to the offered...

45:51.015 --> 45:52.982
On seducing the soul
of the newborn

45:52.984 --> 45:56.085
a vessel will deliver
the chosen."

45:56.087 --> 45:58.521
Okay, we, uh... we have to
get the hell out of here.

45:58.523 --> 46:00.022
How?

46:00.024 --> 46:01.390
There... there has
to be another path.

46:01.392 --> 46:03.092
We have to try again.

46:04.829 --> 46:07.530
Jesus, what kind
of evil is in this place?

46:10.835 --> 46:12.168
Can somebody tell me
what is happening?

46:12.170 --> 46:13.970
Is this real?
Is this real...

46:13.972 --> 46:15.471
Calm down. We will
find a way out of here.

46:15.473 --> 46:17.140
Eric, what are you doing?

46:17.142 --> 46:18.775
Eric!

46:18.777 --> 46:20.877
This is where
we're supposed to be.

46:20.879 --> 46:23.513
Right here. This is the strongest
signal I've ever gotten.

46:23.515 --> 46:26.215
Now, we were brought
here for a reason.

46:26.217 --> 46:28.017
Now, I don't know
about you guys,

46:28.019 --> 46:30.019
but I'm gonna go find out
what that reason is.

46:30.021 --> 46:34.056
If you go down there,
I'm not following you.

46:34.058 --> 46:35.391
Eric!

46:36.494 --> 46:39.462
Skye, let him go.

46:53.077 --> 46:55.578
My brother said

46:55.580 --> 46:57.914
that a pretty
young woman's expecting

46:57.916 --> 47:00.349
just to settle in these parts.

47:01.853 --> 47:04.954
Um, my husband and our friends

47:04.956 --> 47:07.990
went over to look
for that prison.

47:07.992 --> 47:09.992
That burned down?

47:09.994 --> 47:12.361
Yeah.

47:12.363 --> 47:13.596
Anyway, I was supposed
to go get them,

47:13.598 --> 47:16.432
so, can we pick them
up on the way?

47:16.434 --> 47:18.301
There's one good thing
that came out of that fire

47:18.303 --> 47:20.169
at least.

47:20.171 --> 47:23.539
It killed that devil
preacher Kane.

47:23.541 --> 47:26.309
Killed him good.

47:27.445 --> 47:29.846
We heard about him.

47:31.182 --> 47:34.050
Most have.

47:34.052 --> 47:37.320
Move in these parts had...
Had someone they love

47:37.322 --> 47:38.888
pulled off into the next world

47:38.890 --> 47:42.358
by his bush axe.

47:42.360 --> 47:45.995
That man had no good in him.

47:45.997 --> 47:48.331
Pure evil, he was.

47:49.567 --> 47:51.567
How did they catch him?

47:51.569 --> 47:54.103
It weren't no "they."

47:54.105 --> 47:58.040
- Captain got him.
- The captain?

47:58.042 --> 47:59.442
Well, he ain't been
there for a while,

47:59.444 --> 48:01.210
but we still call him.

48:01.212 --> 48:05.181
They let me ride along
for old time's sake.

48:05.183 --> 48:07.450
Feels like home

48:07.452 --> 48:10.319
in the squad car.

48:10.321 --> 48:13.155
- -He brought a
lot of these parts.

48:14.626 --> 48:16.659
He's the one who kept
this place from falling

48:16.661 --> 48:18.594
to the sodomites.

48:25.036 --> 48:27.637
What is that?

48:27.639 --> 48:30.406
People up here
believe different.

48:30.408 --> 48:35.144
Tradition's all just
passed down generations.

48:41.386 --> 48:42.451
These aren't the same roads

48:42.453 --> 48:44.086
that we took to get up here.

48:44.088 --> 48:48.024
More than one road in the hills.

49:06.945 --> 49:08.577
What you calling at?

49:08.579 --> 49:10.079
Ah!

49:12.083 --> 49:14.350
Is your body speaking at you?

49:14.352 --> 49:17.286
Yeah, I need you to pull over.

49:17.288 --> 49:19.989
We're gonna be out
in a few minutes.

49:19.991 --> 49:21.624
No, I'm gonna be sick.

49:21.626 --> 49:23.326
I need you to pull over now.

49:25.964 --> 49:29.565
Please?

49:37.976 --> 49:39.542
Hey, come back!

49:41.446 --> 49:43.045
It ain't safe!

49:49.053 --> 49:50.486
Okay, we have to find
another way out of here.

49:50.488 --> 49:52.221
How?
It's pitch black out there.

49:52.223 --> 49:54.123
- You have a better idea?
- Yeah, we call for help.

49:54.125 --> 49:55.725
- No one can get any reception.
- We can, we just have to...

49:55.727 --> 49:58.094
We just have to keep trying.

49:58.096 --> 50:00.029
You know, cause Sarah's...
Sarah's out there,

50:00.031 --> 50:01.564
you know, and she's...
She's waiting for us.

50:01.566 --> 50:03.366
- Don't touch me!
- Hey, calm down, calm down.

50:03.368 --> 50:05.201
Skye!

50:09.507 --> 50:11.774
Chewing on those like tic tacs.
What is that?

50:14.045 --> 50:16.612
Thorazine?

50:16.614 --> 50:19.749
How many of these
are you taking?

50:19.751 --> 50:21.317
How long have you been on this?

50:21.319 --> 50:23.486
Since I was eight
years old. All right?

50:23.488 --> 50:25.928
I've been a fucking schizophrenic
since I was eight years old.

51:16.607 --> 51:18.441
Sarah?

51:21.079 --> 51:23.846
Hey, we're lost.
Can you help us?

51:30.088 --> 51:31.187
Oh, shit.

51:34.125 --> 51:35.658
- What's up, what's up?
- There's people out there.

51:35.660 --> 51:37.126
What?

51:37.128 --> 51:38.427
Who are they?

51:38.429 --> 51:39.428
We don't want to find out.

51:39.430 --> 51:40.696
What are we gonna do?

51:40.698 --> 51:42.198
Okay, think. Think,
think, think.

51:42.200 --> 51:43.632
Okay, look, we hide in there

51:43.634 --> 51:45.267
and we wait them out.

51:45.269 --> 51:46.669
- Are you fucking insane?
- Am I fucking insane?

51:46.671 --> 51:48.304
What, do you wanna
hang around and say hi?

51:48.306 --> 51:50.139
Is there any other way?

51:50.141 --> 51:51.774
May... maybe
we could sidestep them.

51:51.776 --> 51:53.309
What if we can't
leave this place?

51:53.311 --> 51:54.577
What if every path
leads us back here?

51:54.579 --> 51:56.245
We are gonna leave this place.

51:56.247 --> 51:58.848
- They're coming. -Let them
bring it the fuck on.

51:58.850 --> 52:00.616
All right, you take them
and hide the girls,

52:00.618 --> 52:03.586
I'm gonna try to avert them,
and send for help.

52:03.588 --> 52:05.354
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, come on.

52:14.298 --> 52:16.432
Hey, come on, come on, come on.

52:16.434 --> 52:19.502
We gotta find Eric. He doesn't
know there are people out there.

52:19.504 --> 52:22.471
If he wants to go on his little trip, fine,
but this bus is not taking any detours.

52:22.473 --> 52:25.508
- You're just gonna leave him?
- Hey!

52:25.510 --> 52:26.575
Look, we're gonna get out
of this hellhole

52:26.577 --> 52:27.743
one way, or another,

52:27.745 --> 52:29.378
but I am not searching for him.

52:29.380 --> 52:30.613
Come on.

52:45.463 --> 52:49.431
Where are we?

52:49.433 --> 52:52.401
I don't think
this is the way out, Dave.

52:52.403 --> 52:54.537
I'm working on it.

53:23.367 --> 53:24.700
Eric?

53:54.932 --> 53:56.632
Matt?

54:06.277 --> 54:08.010
Guys?

54:18.356 --> 54:19.888
Guys?

54:29.634 --> 54:31.767
Oh, shit.

54:34.772 --> 54:36.272
What the hell are you doing?

54:36.274 --> 54:37.706
Just give me a minute, Bree.

54:37.708 --> 54:40.776
Oh, hell no.
Come on.

54:43.881 --> 54:46.749
"Murder, rape...

54:46.751 --> 54:49.885
Stabbed to death.

54:49.887 --> 54:51.487
Buried alive."

54:51.489 --> 54:53.022
Jesus Christ.

54:53.024 --> 54:55.691
It's almost like someone
wanted us to find this.

54:55.693 --> 54:57.526
Bree?

55:01.666 --> 55:03.966
Where the fuck is she?

55:03.968 --> 55:05.901
Shit.

55:14.645 --> 55:16.445
Eric?

55:19.917 --> 55:21.884
Eric?

55:23.521 --> 55:24.687
Eric!

55:25.956 --> 55:27.656
- Eric, we gotta go now.
- Hey.

55:29.360 --> 55:30.726
You came back.

55:30.728 --> 55:33.329
There are people up there.

55:33.331 --> 55:34.630
- What people?
- I don't know.

55:34.632 --> 55:36.098
They were speaking
in some weird language.

55:36.100 --> 55:38.334
And then I was calling
for them for help,

55:38.336 --> 55:40.369
but then they just started
coming after us and...

55:40.371 --> 55:42.004
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Slow down.

55:42.006 --> 55:45.674
We had to come down here,
they were coming.

55:45.676 --> 55:48.344
Eric?

55:48.346 --> 55:49.945
This is it.

55:52.750 --> 55:54.883
Are you fucking shitting me?

55:54.885 --> 55:57.753
- We have to get out of...
- It's fine.

55:57.755 --> 56:00.389
This is what I came for.

56:19.844 --> 56:21.910
Get it together.

56:31.522 --> 56:33.722
That's not real.

56:52.710 --> 56:54.510
Matt?

57:02.553 --> 57:04.953
What spirits
are trapped in here?

57:11.629 --> 57:13.695
Come on, I know you can hear me.

57:16.500 --> 57:18.634
Just speak to me, okay?

57:21.038 --> 57:24.039
Come on, god damn it,
talk to us!

57:24.041 --> 57:25.774
Those people are coming.

57:25.776 --> 57:27.543
This place is
some sort of sanctuary,

57:27.545 --> 57:29.945
we don't belong here.

57:34.919 --> 57:36.652
What the fuck?

57:41.025 --> 57:43.091
They're people.

57:43.093 --> 57:45.828
They're fucking people.

57:45.830 --> 57:47.763
We have to get the fuck
out of here, now.

57:47.765 --> 57:50.132
Do you hear me?

57:50.134 --> 57:52.968
This is a trap, this is
exactly what they wanted.

57:55.506 --> 57:56.905
I'm outta here.

57:59.944 --> 58:02.044
Skye!

58:03.247 --> 58:05.047
Skye, come on.

58:26.036 --> 58:27.035
Get out.

58:27.037 --> 58:29.137
What the fuck?

58:29.139 --> 58:30.973
All right.

59:09.246 --> 59:10.312
Matt!

59:17.187 --> 59:19.988
Oh, come on, Dave.

59:19.990 --> 59:21.056
Jesus Christ.

59:56.860 --> 59:58.627
Shit.

01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:19.281
Ma'am, did you drop something?

01:00:23.654 --> 01:00:25.687
What the hell is this?

01:00:40.004 --> 01:00:41.403
You know the plan.

01:00:41.405 --> 01:00:43.105
They're gone until spring.

01:00:48.045 --> 01:00:51.213
Captain's gonna have your ass
if you're wrong, boy.

01:00:51.215 --> 01:00:53.281
Say so?

01:00:53.283 --> 01:00:56.852
See for yourself.

01:00:56.854 --> 01:00:58.253
She's got the mark.

01:01:01.792 --> 01:01:03.659
Our prayers have been answered.

01:01:03.661 --> 01:01:04.860
What she do?

01:01:04.862 --> 01:01:06.795
She's just a kid.

01:01:06.797 --> 01:01:08.430
Lord, have mercy.

01:01:08.432 --> 01:01:10.966
It's what she's going to do.

01:01:10.968 --> 01:01:13.335
Tell sister
to prepare the vessel.

01:01:13.337 --> 01:01:16.204
Full moon could
prove fertile tonight.

01:01:19.777 --> 01:01:21.810
Sister.

01:01:31.388 --> 01:01:34.856
Sweet child need love.

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:36.124
You get now.

01:01:36.126 --> 01:01:37.359
This is my work.

01:01:41.765 --> 01:01:44.032
Captain gonna
put on a show tonight.

01:01:50.974 --> 01:01:52.307
It's all right, girl.

01:01:54.344 --> 01:01:56.712
Let me help you now.

01:01:58.816 --> 01:02:01.183
One of you might get lucky too.

01:02:02.453 --> 01:02:05.353
We're gonna make you
a strong mama.

01:02:05.355 --> 01:02:07.022
Till the moon delivers.

01:02:07.024 --> 01:02:08.990
The seed's sewn.

01:02:08.992 --> 01:02:12.027
The circle continue to turn.

01:02:16.133 --> 01:02:18.100
I've got her.

01:02:18.102 --> 01:02:19.468
Save yourself.

01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:21.136
Ugh!

01:02:21.138 --> 01:02:23.138
Come here!

01:02:32.182 --> 01:02:33.815
Kane!

01:03:34.878 --> 01:03:36.878
Your choice will be right.

01:03:59.369 --> 01:04:01.436
Sarah!

01:04:01.438 --> 01:04:04.172
Holy fuck.

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:05.574
You okay?

01:04:05.576 --> 01:04:07.108
Yeah.

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:08.977
I been calling your name
down the hallway,

01:04:08.979 --> 01:04:10.846
it's like you're
in a trance or something.

01:04:10.848 --> 01:04:12.614
No, I was watching...

01:04:12.616 --> 01:04:14.015
There's some seriously weird

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:16.418
fucking shit going on right now.

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:18.153
Where's Matt?

01:04:20.123 --> 01:04:21.957
I don't know.

01:04:21.959 --> 01:04:23.925
You don't know?

01:04:23.927 --> 01:04:26.127
No...

01:04:26.129 --> 01:04:28.063
What's this?

01:04:28.065 --> 01:04:29.965
I don't...

01:04:31.335 --> 01:04:33.134
"mutilated skin.

01:04:33.136 --> 01:04:34.236
Skinned alive..."

01:04:34.238 --> 01:04:36.137
Where did you get this?

01:04:36.139 --> 01:04:39.007
Dave had it.

01:04:39.009 --> 01:04:41.977
Eric, he's dead.

01:04:41.979 --> 01:04:43.378
He's what?

01:04:45.282 --> 01:04:48.183
"Dusty Cableton,
and Ana Harris found on"...

01:04:48.185 --> 01:04:50.252
Ana Harris?

01:04:50.254 --> 01:04:53.088
That's the name
of the grave in the woods.

01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:56.925
December 5, 1979. She died
on the day we were born.

01:04:56.927 --> 01:04:59.361
What the fuck is going on?

01:04:59.363 --> 01:05:00.462
Eric, I'm scared.

01:05:00.464 --> 01:05:03.064
Shh.

01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:05.000
Eric, I have family.
I have a baby.

01:05:05.002 --> 01:05:07.035
I need to get
the fuck out of here.

01:05:07.037 --> 01:05:09.070
- I don't know what's going on here.
- Yeah, okay.

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:10.538
We will get out
of here. Okay?

01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:16.578
Oh, shit!

01:05:55.319 --> 01:05:56.484
Hey!

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:27.082
It was you.

01:06:27.084 --> 01:06:29.551
Ana had the mark.

01:06:29.553 --> 01:06:32.187
I failed her in the barn.

01:06:32.189 --> 01:06:34.155
Ain't happening again.

01:06:45.435 --> 01:06:48.470
They're gonna kill us all!

01:06:48.472 --> 01:06:51.039
- What the fuck?
- Hey, man, what you doing?

01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:54.476
Fuck you, pig.

01:07:00.417 --> 01:07:03.485
You just could not keep
your mouth shut, could you?

01:07:03.487 --> 01:07:05.353
I was just gonna give you life
and leave it at that.

01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:07.489
But now, now I gotta
take that from you.

01:07:07.491 --> 01:07:09.657
Those kids never judged me.

01:07:09.659 --> 01:07:12.027
Why'd you?

01:07:12.029 --> 01:07:14.262
I done evil.
And I done it for you.

01:07:14.264 --> 01:07:16.431
But I never killed those kids.

01:07:16.433 --> 01:07:19.134
Preacher!

01:07:19.136 --> 01:07:21.369
You should've just
done your job, boy.

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:36.051
It don't matter
what nobody said.

01:07:36.053 --> 01:07:38.653
We...

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:40.088
Make the law around here.

01:07:52.636 --> 01:07:57.639
You'll burn in hell, you hear me, god damn?
To hell I say!

01:08:17.194 --> 01:08:19.461
Let us in!

01:08:47.858 --> 01:08:50.692
Are you ready to bleed?

01:08:50.694 --> 01:08:53.560
No.

01:09:19.589 --> 01:09:22.724
No, stop.
Let me go. Let me go!

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:24.425
No, please don't hurt my baby!

01:09:24.426 --> 01:09:26.426
Shh, shh, shh.
Sweet angel.

01:09:26.429 --> 01:09:28.196
We're not going
to hurt your baby.

01:09:28.198 --> 01:09:29.731
No, no, please no!

01:09:32.269 --> 01:09:34.836
Calm yourself.

01:09:37.741 --> 01:09:38.907
Run!

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.846
Kane!

01:09:53.423 --> 01:09:54.622
Matt!

01:09:57.894 --> 01:10:00.562
Welcome to hell, captain.

01:10:00.564 --> 01:10:02.363
No!

01:10:29.559 --> 01:10:32.927
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:10:44.507 --> 01:10:48.309
Lord, child.
What happened to you?

01:10:48.311 --> 01:10:49.777
Mercy, girl.

01:10:49.779 --> 01:10:51.546
Come with me.

01:11:00.023 --> 01:11:02.257
It's all right, girl.

01:11:02.259 --> 01:11:03.424
Push it.

01:11:05.028 --> 01:11:07.862
We're gonna get this child
out of you.

01:11:07.864 --> 01:11:11.032
Now, give it everything you got.

01:11:12.535 --> 01:11:13.801
Push!

01:11:13.803 --> 01:11:15.036
Now!

01:11:17.507 --> 01:11:19.674
Don't you go white eye on me.

01:11:24.481 --> 01:11:27.348
Here she comes.

01:11:33.356 --> 01:11:35.456
She isn't crying.

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:37.592
'Cause she ain't breathing.

01:11:37.594 --> 01:11:40.295
No. No.

01:11:40.297 --> 01:11:43.798
No! No! No! No!

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:44.866
Give me my baby!

01:11:44.868 --> 01:11:47.902
Give me my baby!
Give me my baby!

01:11:47.904 --> 01:11:51.806
Do you want your child to live?

01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:58.813
Hey, look at me.
We're the lucky ones.

01:11:58.815 --> 01:12:01.482
I just want her
to live a long happy life.

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:03.017
Yeah, well she will.

01:12:03.019 --> 01:12:04.619
I promise.

01:12:04.621 --> 01:12:06.688
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:08.089
I know.

01:12:10.527 --> 01:12:14.962
Yes. Yes.
