05:44.727 --> 05:45.759
GABRIEL.

05:45.761 --> 05:47.161
TOOK A BULLET

ONE SHOT KILLED HIM?

05:54.204 --> 05:55.853
ANYWHERE ELSE,
HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE HIT.

05:55.855 --> 05:57.588
I MEAN,
HE'S A PROFESSIONAL BOXER.

05:57.590 --> 06:00.925
HE TKOed THE NUMBER TWO-RANKED
MIDDLEWEIGHT TONIGHT.

06:00.927 --> 06:02.960
HIS BROTHER
SEE THIS GO DOWN?

06:02.962 --> 06:04.929
NO. MET US AT THE E.R.

06:04.931 --> 06:06.798
HE'S WAITING
IN THE HALLWAY.

06:17.792 --> 06:19.793

06:19.795 --> 06:21.595
MIKE.

06:21.597 --> 06:22.763
YOU ALL RIGHT?

06:22.765 --> 06:26.034
THE BOUNCER CALLED ME,

06:26.036 --> 06:27.701
AND GABRIEL WAS JUST
TRYING TO SAVE THIS GIRL.

06:27.703 --> 06:30.938
JUST... JUST SLOW DOWN HERE.

06:30.940 --> 06:33.274
WHERE WAS GABRIEL DRINKING?

06:33.276 --> 06:36.277
CONLAN'S ON GRAND AVENUE.

06:36.279 --> 06:38.012

06:39.282 --> 06:40.481
YEAH,
I'M GONNA GO WITH YOU.

06:40.483 --> 06:41.482
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

06:41.484 --> 06:42.483
YOU'VE GOT PAPERWORK HERE.

06:42.485 --> 06:43.518
YOU'RE BETTER OFF HERE.

06:43.520 --> 06:44.519
NOW, YOU GOT A GIRLFRIEND
OR SOMETHING

06:44.521 --> 06:45.520
THAT CAN BE WITH YOU?

06:45.522 --> 06:47.772
I DON'T WANT HER HERE.

06:47.774 --> 06:49.974
GUS, UH,
GABRIEL AND ME,

06:49.976 --> 06:52.043
OUR MANAGER,

06:54.281 --> 06:57.381
DON'T YOU WORRY.

06:57.383 --> 07:00.317
YOU FIND OUT WHO DID THIS
TO MY BROTHER, MIKE.

07:03.254 --> 07:05.322
CALL YOUR PRECINCT.

07:05.324 --> 07:07.558
TELL THEM MAJOR CASE
IS TAKING THIS ONE, OKAY?

07:07.560 --> 07:09.059
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

07:11.262 --> 07:13.948
SO YOU WERE A MENTOR
TO THIS KID PETER?

07:13.950 --> 07:16.050
HIS MOTHER'S DEAD,
HIS FATHER'S IN SING-SING.

07:16.052 --> 07:17.684
I INTRODUCED HIM TO BOXING

07:17.686 --> 07:20.888
AND TOOK HIM OUT
FOR BURGERS AFTER.

07:20.890 --> 07:22.823
HE'S DONE ALL RIGHT.
HE WON THE GLOVES.

07:22.825 --> 07:24.358
THE AMATEUR CHAMPIONSHIP?

07:24.360 --> 07:26.093
TURNED PRO A YEAR AGO.

07:26.095 --> 07:27.828
WAS HIS BROTHER
A BOXER TOO?

07:27.830 --> 07:29.230
A VERY TALENTED ONE,

07:29.232 --> 07:32.950
BUT IT DIDN'T DO HIM
ANY GOOD LAST NIGHT.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.401
THIS HOTTIE'S BOYFRIEND
WAS A DICK.

07:34.403 --> 07:36.003
THEY WERE BOTH WASTED.

07:36.005 --> 07:37.504
ARE THEY REGULARS?

07:37.506 --> 07:39.640
I NEVER SEEN THEM BEFORE.

07:39.642 --> 07:41.408
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

07:41.410 --> 07:43.310
DID GABRIEL PUT HIMSELF IN
THE MIDDLE OF THEIR DRUNKEN SPAT

07:43.312 --> 07:44.378
AND GET HIMSELF SHOT?

07:44.380 --> 07:45.663
I DON'T KNOW.
I DIDN'T SEE.

07:45.665 --> 07:47.164
I WAS WORKING THE DOOR.

07:47.166 --> 07:48.616
I WISH I TOOK
THE TWO STEPS.

07:48.618 --> 07:50.318
MY GOD,
I SHOULD HAVE MADE HIM.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.552
YOU ON THE JOB?

07:51.554 --> 07:53.421
BROOKLYN NORTH.
I VESTED LAST YEAR.

07:53.423 --> 07:55.556
<i>I DID HEAR SHOUTS.</i>

07:55.558 --> 07:56.390
THE WOMAN SCREAMED.

07:56.392 --> 07:57.491
THEN A GUNSHOT.

07:57.493 --> 07:59.894
THEN A MOTORCYCLE REVS UP.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.913
TWO SETS OF TRACKS.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.581
YEAH, IT COULD HAVE BEEN
TWO BIKES I HEARD.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.449
BY THE TIME I GOT TO THE SCENE,
THEY WERE GONE.

08:05.451 --> 08:07.118
DID YOU MAKE THE GIRL
ON HER OWN BIKE?

08:07.120 --> 08:09.603
NOT IN THAT SKIRT AND HEELS.

08:09.605 --> 08:10.705
THE DICK
COULD HAVE HAD A BUDDY.

08:10.707 --> 08:12.690
WAS HE CARRYING IN THE BAR?

08:12.692 --> 08:13.524
HE LOOKED SKETCHY
COMING IN.

08:13.526 --> 08:15.026
I PATTED HIM DOWN.
HE WAS CLEAN.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.661
SO THE SECOND GUY
HAD THE GUN.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.996
I DID A CANVASS.
NOBODY KNEW THESE PEOPLE.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.732
BOTH WHITE, EARLY 30s.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.032
GUY WORE A CAP.

08:22.034 --> 08:23.501
SHE WAS A KNOCKOUT

08:23.503 --> 08:26.254
DETECTIVES, A .22 BERETTA.

08:26.256 --> 08:29.290
ESU FISHED IT OUT
OF A SEWER TWO BLOCKS AWAY.

08:29.292 --> 08:30.307
WE MIGHT GET LUCKY
WITH PRINTS.

08:30.309 --> 08:31.959
DO WHAT YOU CAN.

08:31.961 --> 08:34.160
WE'LL SEND OVER
A SKETCH ARTIST.

08:37.265 --> 08:38.832
HOW'D THEY PAY
FOR THEIR DRINKS?

08:38.835 --> 08:40.034
THEY DIDN'T.

08:40.035 --> 08:41.669
IT WAS THE FIRST THING
I ASKED THE BARTENDER.

08:41.671 --> 08:44.020
GABRIEL'S MANAGER GUS KOVAK

08:44.023 --> 08:45.906
WAS BUYING ROUNDS
FOR THE HOUSE.

08:50.478 --> 08:53.047
YOU WANNA GO
WITH BLUE OR WHITE?

08:53.049 --> 08:56.050
I DON'T KNOW, GUS.

08:56.052 --> 08:59.186
WHAT'D THE GUY
AT THE FUNERAL PARLOR SAY?

08:59.188 --> 09:01.421
HE SAID, "PICK OUT A SHIRT
AND SUIT",

09:01.423 --> 09:03.624
SOMETHING HE LIKED."

09:12.134 --> 09:14.301
GABRIEL WORE THIS THE NIGHT
HE KNOCKED OUT WILSON.

09:14.303 --> 09:16.871
REMEMBER, I TOOK YOU BOYS
TO PETER LUGER'S?

09:16.873 --> 09:18.238
YEAH.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.141
HE HAD TWO ORDERS
OF CHICKEN.

09:20.143 --> 09:22.376
HOME-STYLE.

09:22.378 --> 09:25.062
WHO ORDERS CHICKEN
AT PETER LUGER'S?

09:25.064 --> 09:28.198
HE LIKED CHICKEN.

09:33.338 --> 09:35.139
[doorbell rings]

09:40.028 --> 09:41.345
THERE WAS A YOUNG LADY
TALKING TO GABRIEL.

09:41.347 --> 09:43.164
LONG HAIR, NICE LOOKING.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.183
<i>(Logan) DO YOU RECALL ANY
OF THEIR CONVERSATION?</i>

09:45.185 --> 09:47.835
WELL, SHE COULD SMELL
THE VICTORY ON HIM.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.486
AND HER BOYFRIEND
DIDN'T LIKE THAT?

09:49.488 --> 09:52.039
A BIG WHITE GUY,
HAD TOO MANY TO DRINK.

09:52.041 --> 09:54.192
LISTEN, GABRIEL DIDN'T
PROVOKE THIS IN ANY WAY.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.459
HE WAS A PERFECT GENTLEMAN.

09:55.461 --> 09:57.578
HOW LONG DID YOU
TRAIN GABRIEL FOR?

09:57.580 --> 09:59.113
FIVE YEARS.
PETER TOO.

09:59.115 --> 10:00.614
DID YOU EVER
SEE GABRIEL FIGHT?

10:00.616 --> 10:02.417
YEAH.

10:04.036 --> 10:07.187
IT'S FUNNY TO GET A CHAMPION
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

10:10.442 --> 10:13.644
MIKE, THIS IS CHRISTINA.

10:13.646 --> 10:15.846
PETER TALKS ABOUT YOU
ALL THE TIME.

10:15.848 --> 10:17.948
I MADE PIROGIS.

10:17.950 --> 10:20.901
[speaking Polish]

10:20.903 --> 10:22.703
LISTEN, I'LL GET
OUT OF YOUR WAY.

10:22.705 --> 10:23.988
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I CAN DO...

10:23.990 --> 10:26.224
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.
[pager beeping]

10:26.226 --> 10:28.375
UH, PETE, IF YOU NEED ME,
YOU GOT MY NUMBER, OKAY?

10:28.377 --> 10:29.994
AND IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

10:32.297 --> 10:33.964
WE GOT A HIT
ON THE BERETTA.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.299
A LEGAL PURCHASE
FROM A GUN SHOP

10:35.301 --> 10:37.035
IN GREENVILLE,
SOUTH CAROLINA.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.302
THE BUYER LIVES IN PHILLY.

10:38.304 --> 10:41.055
YEAH, SO HOW'D THE GUN
END UP IN NEW YORK?

10:41.057 --> 10:44.175
A GUN? NO WAY
WOULD I BUY A GUN.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.843
I'VE NEVER EVEN BEEN
TO GREENVILLE.

10:45.845 --> 10:48.228
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE
USED YOUR I.D.

10:48.230 --> 10:52.699
WAS YOUR WALLET
STOLEN RECENTLY?

10:52.701 --> 10:56.103
UH, IT'S MY DAUGHTER CALLIE.

10:56.105 --> 10:58.605
SHE'S GOT, UH...

10:58.607 --> 11:00.941
SHE'S GOT
SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES.

11:00.943 --> 11:03.744
WELL, WE'RE GONNA NEED TO TALK
TO HER.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.563
NO. WE LOST TOUCH.

11:05.565 --> 11:07.831
I CAN'T ENABLE ANYMORE.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.618
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER
IN OVER A YEAR,

11:10.620 --> 11:13.337
NOT SINCE SHE LEFT JAKEY
WITH ME.

11:13.339 --> 11:16.107
YOU KNOW,
SHE'S STILL A GOOD MOTHER.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.908
SHE SENT ME 500 BUCKS
LAST WEEK.

11:17.910 --> 11:20.844
I BOUGHT HIM THAT...
THAT TRICYCLE.

11:23.798 --> 11:25.699
WHICH ONE DO YOU WANT ME
TO PICK OUT?

11:25.701 --> 11:28.068
I WANT YOU TO PICK
THE GIRL YOU SAW.

11:28.070 --> 11:29.837
FOCUS, GUS.
CONCENTRATE.

11:29.839 --> 11:31.339
LISTEN, DID YOU ASK
THE BARTENDER?

11:31.341 --> 11:33.073
DID YOU ASK THE BOUNCER?

11:38.530 --> 11:41.348
ALL RIGHT, I THINK IT'S HER.

11:42.984 --> 11:44.718
YEAH, SHE'S THE ONE.
A SWEET GIRL.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.071
IT TURNS OUT
SHE'S NOT SO SWEET.

11:47.073 --> 11:49.089
NO, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

11:49.091 --> 11:50.791
WE GAVE OUT FIVE GRAND
FOR INFORMATION.

11:50.793 --> 11:51.792
WHERE IS SHE?

11:51.794 --> 11:53.093
WELL, YOU HESITATED BEFORE.

11:53.095 --> 11:55.346
I MEAN, DID YOU ACTUALLY
RECOGNIZE HER?

11:55.348 --> 11:56.914
MAYBE YOU MISTOOK HER
FOR A GROUPIE

11:56.916 --> 11:57.982
HANGING AROUND
THE BOXING RING.

11:57.984 --> 11:59.083
NO.

11:59.085 --> 12:00.100
GABRIEL WASN'T LIKE THAT.

12:00.102 --> 12:02.503
HE KEPT HIS EYE
ON THE PRIZE.

12:02.505 --> 12:04.889
I NEVER SEEN THIS GIRL
BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.157
SHE GOT MY BROTHER KILLED.

12:13.598 --> 12:15.482
[door buzzes]
YEAH, THAT'S CALLIE.

12:15.484 --> 12:18.619
WHAT'S SHE
IN TROUBLE FOR NOW?

12:18.621 --> 12:22.089
WE JUST WANT TO TALK
TO HER.

12:22.091 --> 12:23.457
[pounds]

12:25.394 --> 12:27.695
CALLIE JOHNSON!

12:27.697 --> 12:30.364
NYPD.

12:32.234 --> 12:34.101
CALLIE?

12:40.509 --> 12:42.042
CALLIE.

12:44.946 --> 12:46.814
OH, OH, OH!

12:54.389 --> 12:56.657
<i>(Logan) SHE'S GOT NO PULSE.</i>

12:56.659 --> 12:58.425
<i>LOOKS LIKE AN OD, HUH?</i>

12:58.427 --> 13:00.761
THEY CLEANED HER OUT.

13:00.763 --> 13:02.730
EXCEPT FOR THIS.

13:02.732 --> 13:04.515
HER SON.

13:10.488 --> 13:13.191
CALLIE JOHNSON DID DIE
OF AN OVERDOSE.

13:13.193 --> 13:16.194
AND THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
INTERESTING IN THE TOX SCREEN.

13:16.196 --> 13:19.229
BESIDES THE HEROIN, SHE HAD
FENTANYL IN HER SYSTEM.

13:19.231 --> 13:21.415
IT'S 80 TIMES MORE POTENT
THAN MORPHINE.

13:21.417 --> 13:23.684
SHE WAS TRYING
A NEW HIGH.

13:23.686 --> 13:25.852
OR SOMEONE GAVE HER
A BURN BACK,

13:25.854 --> 13:27.821
WANTED TO MAKE SURE
SHE DIED.

13:27.823 --> 13:29.957
YOU HAVE ANY CLUSTER ODs
THE LAST FEW DAYS?

13:29.959 --> 13:32.043
NOPE. NOTHING
FROM HER NEIGHBORHOOD.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.711
THAT MEANS THERE WASN'T
A BAD BATCH ON THE STREETS.

13:33.713 --> 13:38.165
OKAY, SO WHY WAS SHE KILLED?

13:38.167 --> 13:42.186
WELL, YOU CAN'T TRUST
A JUNKIE, RIGHT?

13:42.188 --> 13:43.821
I MEAN,
SHE PLAYED HER PART.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.022
SHE GOT GABRIEL
TO DEFEND HER.

13:45.024 --> 13:48.542
SO BOOM.

13:48.544 --> 13:50.478
<i>CALLIE WAS AN ADDICT,</i>

13:50.480 --> 13:51.812
BUT SHE DOESN'T
COME FORWARD

13:51.814 --> 13:53.731
TO COLLECT
THE $5,000 REWARD?

13:53.733 --> 13:54.765
COULD HAVE BEEN AFRAID.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.567
SHE DID HAVE A RECORD

13:56.569 --> 13:58.302
AND A NASTY BOYFRIEND.

13:58.304 --> 13:59.636
YOU MEAN AN ACCOMPLICE?

13:59.638 --> 14:01.072
EITHER WAY, ANY LEADS?

14:01.074 --> 14:03.440
THE SUPER SAYS A LOT
OF GUYS CAME AND WENT.

14:03.442 --> 14:04.541
NO ONE SPECIAL.

14:04.543 --> 14:06.110
AND HER MOBILE RECORDS
ONLY SHOW CALLS

14:06.112 --> 14:08.079
TO NO-NAME CELLS,
PROBABLY HER DEALERS,

14:08.081 --> 14:10.081
AND HER MOTHER.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.298
HER MOTHER DID TELL US

14:11.300 --> 14:12.833
THAT CALLIE SENT HER $500

14:12.835 --> 14:14.835
FOR HER LITTLE BOY
A WEEK AGO.

14:14.837 --> 14:17.338
BLOOD MONEY FOR LURING GABRIEL
OUT OF THE BAR

14:17.340 --> 14:18.472
AND TO HIS DEATH.

14:18.474 --> 14:21.475
SOMEONE KNEW GABRIEL
WAS A SOFT TOUCH.

14:21.477 --> 14:22.710
FIND OUT WHO.

14:25.180 --> 14:26.897
I WANT TO STAY
WITH YOU, BABY.

14:26.899 --> 14:28.065
YOU DON'T NEED
TO DO THAT.

14:28.067 --> 14:29.500
I'M JUST GONNA GO
HIT THE BAGS.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.735
OKAY. I LOVE YOU.

14:31.737 --> 14:33.971
YEAH. I LOVE YOU TOO.

14:33.973 --> 14:34.938
YEAH?

14:36.475 --> 14:37.475
BYE.

14:37.477 --> 14:38.859
[giggles]

14:38.861 --> 14:41.328
BYE.

14:59.598 --> 15:00.881
COME ON, PETER.

15:00.883 --> 15:03.534
<i>WHAT ARE YOU DO...</i>
<i>SHOW ME YOU'RE A PUNCHER.</i>

15:03.536 --> 15:05.403
SHOW IT TO ME!

15:05.405 --> 15:09.140
<i>WAKE UP!</i>

15:10.225 --> 15:11.943
AND TIME! TIME!

15:11.945 --> 15:13.894
COME HERE.

15:16.732 --> 15:18.498
<i>WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?</i>

15:18.500 --> 15:19.784
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING
YOURSELF!

15:19.786 --> 15:23.187
THINK GABRIEL WOULD WANT YOU TO
RUN AWAY LIKE THAT IN A FIGHT?

15:25.257 --> 15:26.556
NOW GET BACK IN THERE
AND SHOW ME THE POWER.

15:26.558 --> 15:27.825
SHOW IT TO ME.
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.710
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT!

15:29.712 --> 15:34.048
SHOW ME WHAT YOUR BROTHER
THOUGHT YOU HAD.

15:34.050 --> 15:35.249
YOU'RE A PUNCHER!

15:47.095 --> 15:50.063
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

15:50.065 --> 15:51.665
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

15:58.790 --> 16:01.225
EVERYBODY LOVED GABRIEL.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

16:01.227 --> 16:03.527
DID YOUR BROTHER HAVE A HABIT
OF BEING A KNIGHT

16:03.529 --> 16:04.661
IN SHINING ARMOR?

16:04.663 --> 16:06.831
LIKE I TOLD YOU,
HE WAS A GENTLEMAN ALWAYS.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.532
AND EVERYONE
KNEW THAT ABOUT HIM?

16:08.534 --> 16:10.767
WHEN MY MOM
WAS STILL ALIVE,

16:10.769 --> 16:12.769
MY DAD USED TO POP HER
PRETTY GOOD.

16:12.771 --> 16:14.004
GABRIEL COULDN'T STAND IT.

16:14.006 --> 16:15.840
HE WOULDN'T EVEN LET ANYBODY
SWEAR AROUND A WOMAN.

16:15.842 --> 16:19.460
DID GABRIEL
OWE ANYONE MONEY?

16:19.462 --> 16:21.445
THESE BOYS ARE TAKEN CARE OF.
THEY LIVE WITH ME RENT-FREE.

16:21.447 --> 16:23.614
<i>(Logan) HOW ABOUT GIRLFRIEND TROUBLES?
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?</i>

16:23.616 --> 16:24.765
<i>(Peter) NO.</i>

16:24.767 --> 16:26.066
WHAT ABOUT ANOTHER BOXER?

16:26.068 --> 16:27.518
DID HE HAVE A BEEF
WITH ANYBODY?

16:27.520 --> 16:28.903
NO. MY BROTHER,
HE DIDN'T PICK FIGHTS.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.805
HE DIDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO PROVE.

16:30.807 --> 16:32.356
WELL, NO OFFENSE, HE DID HIT
PEOPLE AS HARD AS HE COULD

16:32.358 --> 16:33.424
FOR A LIVING.

16:33.426 --> 16:36.260
YOU DON'T GET IT,
DO YOU, MISS?

16:36.262 --> 16:38.062
I MEAN, YOU DON'T
SEE THE POETRY.

16:38.064 --> 16:42.450
SOME PEOPLE DON'T.
NO OFFENSE.

16:42.452 --> 16:43.634
ALL RIGHT, WELL, LET'S TALK
ABOUT GABRIEL'S LAST FIGHT.

16:43.636 --> 16:46.487
SO YOU WERE OUT CELEBRATING?

16:46.489 --> 16:47.654
CALVIN'S PEOPLE THOUGHT
THIS WAS JUST A TUNE-UP BOUT.

16:47.656 --> 16:49.206
CALVIN'S NEXT FIGHT
WAS FOR THE TITLE.

16:49.208 --> 16:52.426
TILL GABRIEL GOT IN THE WAY.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.578
YOU GOT A TAPE
OF THAT LAST FIGHT?

16:54.580 --> 16:57.848
CAN'T SEE.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.633
<i>(Peter) YEAH, MY BROTHER
CALLED THE FIGHT.</i>

16:59.635 --> 17:01.352
HE KNEW CALVIN
WAS GOING BLIND.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.120
AFTER THAT PUNCH
TO THE EYE.

17:03.122 --> 17:05.137
YOU CAN SEE HIS RETINA
IS DETACHING.

17:05.140 --> 17:07.574
<i>FIRST YOU SEE A LOT OF FLOATERS</i>
<i>AND THEN IT'S LIGHTS OUT.</i>

17:07.576 --> 17:10.344
IS THAT THE POETRY
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT?

17:10.346 --> 17:11.243
HEY, MY BROTHER
COULD HAVE DESTROYED THE GUY.

17:11.246 --> 17:12.529
HE DID THE RIGHT THING.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.832
WHAT YOU TAUGHT ME, MIKE...
CONTROL, USE YOUR HEAD,

17:15.834 --> 17:18.050
FIGHT TO WIN, NOT TO KILL.

17:18.053 --> 17:19.336
THAT'S IT.
NO MORE, NO MORE, NO MORE.

17:19.338 --> 17:22.039
HOW BIG AN UPSET
WAS GABRIEL'S WIN?

17:22.040 --> 17:24.241
IT WAS HUGE.
THEY UNDERESTIMATED HIM.

17:24.242 --> 17:25.825
<i>(Gus) THEY TOOK
GABRIEL FOR GRANTED.</i>

17:25.827 --> 17:27.993
PETE, TURN THAT UP,
WOULD YOU?

17:27.996 --> 17:29.679
YOU FAG!
WE'RE JUST FIGHTING!

17:29.681 --> 17:30.915
I'M GONNA KILL YOU,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

17:30.917 --> 17:33.617
YOU'RE DEAD!
YOU'RE DEAD!

17:33.619 --> 17:37.303
ONE MORE PUNCH,
CALVIN'S BLIND IN THAT EYE.

17:37.305 --> 17:40.224
MY BROTHER SAVED HIM.

17:40.226 --> 17:44.244
CALVIN DIDN'T SEEM
TOO GRATEFUL.

17:44.246 --> 17:45.512
HE DISRESPECTED ME.

17:45.514 --> 17:46.947
HOW, BY WINNING?

17:46.949 --> 17:48.982
WHO THE HELL
IS HE TO STOP THE FIGHT?

17:48.984 --> 17:51.251
HE SAVED YOUR EYE.

17:51.253 --> 17:53.153
AND TOOK MY TITLE SHOT
'CAUSE OF A LUCKY PUNCH.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.187
WELL, WHICH ONE?

17:54.189 --> 17:55.789
I MEAN, HE HIT YOU
A WHOLE BUNCH.

17:55.791 --> 17:57.908
YOU WERE THERE?

17:57.910 --> 17:58.692
NO, BUT WE WATCHED
THE TAPE.

17:58.694 --> 18:00.194
WE ALSO SAW
HOW YOU WERE SHOUTING

18:00.196 --> 18:01.528
THAT YOU WANTED
GABRIEL DEAD.

18:01.530 --> 18:03.480
I SAY THAT EVERY FIGHT.

18:03.482 --> 18:04.815
I'M GONNA EAT YOUR CHILDREN,
I'M GONNA "F" YOU UP.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.650
IT'S PART OF THE GAME, MAN.
IT'S PSYCH.

18:06.652 --> 18:08.401
A LITTLE LATE. THE FIGHT
WAS ALREADY CALLED.

18:08.403 --> 18:12.456
I WAS PISSED.

18:12.458 --> 18:15.359
LATER, MY WIFE SAID
WHAT YOU SAID.

18:15.361 --> 18:17.461
SHE SAID HE SAVED MY EYE.

18:17.463 --> 18:19.396
SHE WAS RIGHT.

18:19.398 --> 18:21.765
I OWE GABRIEL.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.717
A SHAME,
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

18:23.719 --> 18:27.138
WHERE'D YOU GO
AFTER THE FIGHT?

18:27.140 --> 18:28.372
I WENT STRAIGHT
TO THE OPERATING ROOM

18:28.374 --> 18:29.806
TO REATTACH MY RETINA.

18:29.808 --> 18:31.725
I'LL BE CHAMP
IN EIGHT MONTHS.

18:31.727 --> 18:33.878
YOU SEEM PRETTY SURE
ABOUT THAT.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.580
WHAT HAPPENED SATURDAY NIGHT
WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

18:36.582 --> 18:37.981
GABRIEL SHOULD NOT BE DEAD

18:37.983 --> 18:40.000
BECAUSE HE SHOULD NOT
HAVE BEEN OUT CELEBRATING.

18:40.002 --> 18:41.918
WHY NOT?

18:41.920 --> 18:43.287
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ME
IN THE SIXTH ROUND.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.189
THAT WAS THE DEAL.

18:45.191 --> 18:50.244
<i>MAYBE IF IT WAS,</i>
<i>I'D HAVE GOTTEN SHOT.</i>

18:50.246 --> 18:52.029
THE DEAL?

18:52.031 --> 18:54.665
GABRIEL WAS SUPPOSED
TO TAKE A DIVE?

18:54.667 --> 18:57.418
INSURANCE
FOR YOUR TITLE SHOT?

18:57.420 --> 18:59.636
I'M DONE TALKING.

18:59.638 --> 19:02.072
THEY GOT ME DOPED UP.
I GOTTA REST.

19:05.043 --> 19:07.494
WELL, IF CALVIN THOUGHT
THE FIX WAS IN,

19:07.496 --> 19:10.864
HE MIGHT HAVE DROPPED
HIS GUARD.

19:10.866 --> 19:14.668
THE FIX? MAYBE IN CALVIN'S
DOPED-UP MIND.

19:14.670 --> 19:16.937
NO WAY GABRIEL
THREW THE FIGHT.

19:16.939 --> 19:19.005
OR MAYBE
HE CHANGED HIS MIND.

19:19.007 --> 19:21.442
WHEELER, THE BOY
LIVES A SIMPLE LIFE.

19:21.444 --> 19:23.544
IF HE WAS GETTING PAID,

19:23.546 --> 19:26.697
WHERE'S THE MONEY?

19:26.699 --> 19:28.148
GABRIEL NEVER SPENT A DIME.

19:28.150 --> 19:30.517
HE OPENED HIS WALLET,
MOTHS FLEW OUT.

19:30.519 --> 19:32.403
HE DIDN'T CARRY CASH?

19:32.405 --> 19:34.587
NO. HE SAID
HE'D JUST SPEND IT.

19:34.589 --> 19:36.340
OKAY. WELL, WHAT DID HE DO
WITH HIS SHARE OF THE PURSES?

19:36.342 --> 19:37.507
<i>DID HE HAVE A SAVINGS ACCOUNT?</i>

19:37.509 --> 19:38.541
CHRISTINA PUT IT
IN HER ACCOUNT.

19:38.543 --> 19:39.809
CHRISTINA,
YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

19:39.811 --> 19:41.879
YEAH, SHE HAS US
ON AN ALLOWANCE.

19:41.881 --> 19:44.131
I MEAN, SHE DID
WHEN SHE LIVED HERE.

19:44.133 --> 19:46.649
AND ALL FOUR OF YOU
LIVED HERE TOGETHER?

19:46.651 --> 19:48.601
YEAH. IT WAS GREAT.

19:48.603 --> 19:50.520
I MEAN, SHE COOKED
AND EVERYTHING.

19:50.522 --> 19:53.390
WHY ARE YOU GUYS ASKING
ABOUT GABRIEL'S MONEY?

19:53.392 --> 19:54.541
IT MAY BE CONNECTED
TO WHY HE WAS KILLED.

19:54.543 --> 19:56.126
NO, I TOLD YOU.
HE DIDN'T OWE ANYBODY.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.728
COME ON, PETE,
WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT.

19:57.730 --> 20:00.064
<i>(Wheeler) MIND IF I TAKE
A LOOK IN HIS ROOM?</i>

20:00.066 --> 20:03.149
YEAH, YEAH.
WHATEVER YOU GOTTA DO.

20:03.151 --> 20:05.519
AND WHY DID
CHRISTINA MOVE OUT?

20:05.521 --> 20:08.388
UH, HER SISTER
HAS THREE KIDS,

20:08.390 --> 20:09.989
AND SHE NEEDED
LIVE-IN HELP.

20:09.991 --> 20:13.560
IT'S GOOD PRACTICE FOR WHEN
WE HAVE OUR OWN LITTLE RUGRATS.

20:13.562 --> 20:14.861
YOUR OWN RU...

20:14.863 --> 20:16.196
WHAT, ARE YOU
GETTING MARRIED?

20:16.198 --> 20:18.682
WHEN I MAKE IT,
I'LL GET OUT OF HERE,

20:18.684 --> 20:20.383
GET ONE OF THOSE CONDOS
YOU SEE IN THE ADS

20:20.385 --> 20:21.551
WITH THE PLAYROOM.

20:21.553 --> 20:24.505
GUS WILL VISIT,
LIKE A GRANDPA.

20:24.507 --> 20:25.673
YEAH.
GOOD FOR YOU.

20:25.675 --> 20:28.108
HEY, LOGAN.

20:28.110 --> 20:30.343
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

20:36.250 --> 20:40.054
THE FELT'S BEEN PULLED AWAY
AND TAPED BACK OVER.

20:45.393 --> 20:49.262
THAT'S GOT TO BE,
I DON'T KNOW, TEN GRAND?

20:49.264 --> 20:50.497
WHAT'S THAT?

20:50.499 --> 20:51.515
WAIT IN THE KITCHEN,
PETER.

20:51.517 --> 20:53.250
I WANT TO KNOW,
WHAT IS THAT?

20:53.252 --> 20:54.418
TAKE IT EASY.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.537
I TRUSTED YOU!
YOU BITCH, YOU PLANTED THAT!

20:56.539 --> 20:57.371
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

20:57.373 --> 20:58.739
I DID WHAT?

20:58.741 --> 20:59.573
YOU PLANTED IT!
THERE'S NO WAY!

20:59.575 --> 21:00.907
NO, I KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE ASKING ME.

21:00.909 --> 21:01.959
YOU WERE TRYING TO SAY
MY BROTHER WAS TAKING MONEY?

21:01.961 --> 21:03.676
HOLD OFF, PETE.

21:03.678 --> 21:07.164
HEY, THAT IS IT! OUTSIDE!
COME ON, OUTSIDE! OUTSIDE!

21:13.171 --> 21:15.372
HE WAS CLEAN, MIKE.
HE WAS CLEAN.

21:15.374 --> 21:17.007
HE WAS A BROKEN FIGHTER.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.275
HOW BAD?

21:18.277 --> 21:20.910
BROKE, ALWAYS BROKE.
HE WAS HONEST.

21:20.912 --> 21:22.813
WHO TOLD YOU
HE WASN'T, HUH?

21:22.815 --> 21:23.814
WHO SAID THAT TO YOU?

21:23.816 --> 21:24.848
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
YOU'RE OUT OF LINE.

21:24.850 --> 21:27.318
I KNOW MY PARTNER.
SHE DID NOT PLANT THAT.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.920
NOW, WHAT WAS GABRIEL DOING
WITH THAT MONEY IN HIS ROOM?

21:29.922 --> 21:30.988
I DON'T KNOW!
I DON'T KNOW!

21:30.990 --> 21:32.489
IT'S NOT WHAT
YOU THINK, THOUGH.

21:32.491 --> 21:33.691
ALL RIGHT, TAKE IT EASY.
'CAUSE IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.325
ALL RIGHT,
TAKE IT EASY!

21:37.362 --> 21:39.162
WHAT IS IT?

21:40.532 --> 21:42.032
JUST TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON.

21:42.034 --> 21:44.918
LOOK, I'LL BELIEVE YOU.

21:44.920 --> 21:47.754
HE WAS MY BROTHER, MIKE.

21:47.756 --> 21:50.390
HE WAS MY BIG BROTHER.

21:56.831 --> 22:00.133
[crying]

22:05.956 --> 22:07.957
[crying]

22:12.313 --> 22:13.813
I HANDLE THEIR MONEY,
PETER AND GABRIEL.

22:13.815 --> 22:16.549
THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE
ATM CARDS.

22:16.551 --> 22:17.817
I MEAN, THE ONLY WAY
THEY GET CASH

22:17.819 --> 22:19.386
IS WHEN I GIVE IT
TO THEM.

22:19.388 --> 22:22.489
WELL, MAYBE GABRIEL WAS GETTING
SOMETHING EXTRA ON THE SIDE.

22:22.491 --> 22:25.158
WE DIDN'T HAVE SECRETS
BETWEEN US.

22:25.160 --> 22:26.660
THEY HAVE NO MONEY.

22:26.662 --> 22:28.061
I COOK FOR THEM.

22:28.063 --> 22:30.263
YOU SHOULD LOOK
IN THE FREEZER, THE MEALS.

22:30.265 --> 22:33.333
I GAVE THEM AN ALLOWANCE
OF $100 A WEEK.

22:33.335 --> 22:34.968
HE COULD HAVE SAVED UP
THE TEN GRAND.

22:34.970 --> 22:36.436
HOW?

22:36.438 --> 22:38.922
HE COULDN'T MAKE
HIS HUNDRED LAST A WEEK.

22:38.924 --> 22:42.492
BOXERS, THEY END UP
WITH NOTHING.

22:42.494 --> 22:44.728
THEY GET OLD, HURT.

22:44.730 --> 22:45.779
PETER'S JUST STARTING OUT,

22:45.781 --> 22:47.181
BUT GABRIEL
HAD A WINNING RECORD.

22:47.183 --> 22:48.482
THE PURSES ADD UP.

22:48.484 --> 22:50.801
NOT LIKE YOU THINK.

22:50.803 --> 22:53.303
HE MAKES $20,000
AT THE MOST,

22:53.305 --> 22:56.156
AND TAXES, EXPENSES.

22:56.158 --> 22:57.924
HIS EXPENSES.
WHAT ABOUT KOVAK?

22:57.926 --> 23:00.760
<i>WHAT, HE GETS 10%, RIGHT?</i>

23:00.762 --> 23:02.295
<i>THAT'S THE STANDARD</i>
<i>TRAINER'S FEE.</i>

23:02.297 --> 23:04.798
PLUS A THIRD
FOR BEING THE MANAGER.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.900
MM-HMM.
WHO KEEPS THE BOOKS?

23:06.902 --> 23:08.252
KOVAK USED TO.

23:08.254 --> 23:10.520
I DOUBLE-CHECK
EVERYTHING NOW.

23:10.522 --> 23:11.704
OH, YOU DOUBLE-CHECK, HUH?

23:11.706 --> 23:15.441
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
YOU DON'T TRUST HIM?

23:15.443 --> 23:17.277
THAT CASH,

23:17.279 --> 23:21.114
THERE IS NO WAY GABRIEL
COULD HAVE SAVED IT ON HIS OWN.

23:24.335 --> 23:26.102
WHAT ARE YOU INSINUATING?

23:26.104 --> 23:27.521
<i>(Wheeler) CALVIN
THOUGHT HE HAD A DEAL.</i>

23:27.523 --> 23:29.789
GABRIEL WAS SUPPOSED TO GO DOWN
IN THE SIXTH.

23:29.791 --> 23:34.127
THAT'S JUST ZIGGY GOLD
PLAYING MIND GAMES,

23:34.129 --> 23:36.613
TRYING TO MAKE HIS KID
THINK HE HAD AN EDGE.

23:36.615 --> 23:38.932
THIS PROMOTER, ZIGGY GOLD.

23:38.934 --> 23:41.452
CALVIN WAS ONE OF HIS BOXERS?

23:41.454 --> 23:42.369
LISTEN, I PUT FIVE YEARS
OF BLOOD,

23:42.371 --> 23:43.803
SWEAT, AND TEARS
INTO GABRIEL.

23:43.805 --> 23:45.873
GOLD KNOWS I WOULDN'T
THROW THAT AWAY.

23:45.875 --> 23:50.110
<i>(Wheeler)</i>
<i>WOULD GOLD APPROACH GABRIEL?</i>

23:50.112 --> 23:52.829
WE FOUND TEN GRAND IN CASH
IN GABRIEL'S ROOM, MR. KOVAK.

23:54.899 --> 23:57.768
WHAT...

23:57.770 --> 23:59.736
GABRIEL WOULD NEVER TAKE
A DIVE.

23:59.738 --> 24:00.670
HE DIDN'T.

24:00.672 --> 24:02.872
ANY CHANCE
HE TOOK THE MONEY?

24:06.427 --> 24:09.646
I THOUGHT GOLD WAS JUST UPSET
ABOUT THE LOSS,

24:09.648 --> 24:11.281
ABOUT...

24:11.283 --> 24:13.317
ABOUT CALVIN NOT GETTING
HIS SHOT.

24:13.319 --> 24:16.053
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

24:19.290 --> 24:21.307
GOLD CAME INTO THE DRESSING ROOM
AFTER THE FIGHT.

24:21.309 --> 24:22.976
APPARENTLY HE HAD SOME BUSINESS
WITH GABRIEL.

24:22.978 --> 24:26.263
REALLY?
WERE YOU IN THE ROOM?

24:26.265 --> 24:27.397
NO. HE WAITED
FOR ME TO LEAVE.

24:27.399 --> 24:30.066
BUT I'VE BEEN
IN THE BOXING WORLD 30 YEARS.

24:30.068 --> 24:31.668
I'VE GOT EYES AND EARS
EVERYWHERE.

24:31.670 --> 24:34.303
SO GOLD, WAS HE MAD?

24:34.305 --> 24:36.439
I HEARD HE WAS SMILING.

24:36.441 --> 24:39.192
THAT'S WHEN HE'S DANGEROUS.

24:40.461 --> 24:43.596
[camera shutter snapping]

24:49.520 --> 24:51.722
<i>(Gold) YOU'RE WATCHING
TOO MANY OLD MOVIES.</i>

24:51.724 --> 24:52.906
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

24:52.908 --> 24:55.675
WELL, RIGHT UP TO THE BELL,
THE LINE KEPT MOVING.

24:55.677 --> 24:57.176
THE ODDS
WERE AGAINST GABRIEL,

24:57.178 --> 24:58.612
BUT BY FRIDAY,
FORGET ABOUT IT.

24:58.614 --> 24:59.879
AND THERE WAS
A LOT OF SIDE ACTION

24:59.881 --> 25:01.648
ON THAT SIXTH ROUND KO.

25:01.650 --> 25:04.618
BOXING GAMBLERS,
THEY MAKE WILD BETS.

25:04.620 --> 25:08.121
DID YOU LOSE BIG,
MR. GOLD?

25:08.123 --> 25:09.990
YOU'RE A HOMICIDE DETECTIVE?

25:09.992 --> 25:12.192
I GOT A DAUGHTER YOUR AGE.

25:12.194 --> 25:15.428
WELL, GABRIEL WAS QUICKER
THAN WE THOUGHT.

25:15.430 --> 25:18.365
YOU MEAN, HE TOOK YOUR PAYOFF
AND THEN BACKED OUT OF THE DEAL?

25:18.367 --> 25:21.134
HE GOT LUCKY
WITH HIS LEFT HOOK.

25:21.136 --> 25:23.103
IT COST CALVIN
HIS TITLE SHOT.

25:23.105 --> 25:24.771
THAT HAD TO HURT YOU.

25:24.773 --> 25:28.358
WORD IS, HE WAS SHOT
BY SOME THUG.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.826
AND YOU'VE NEVER HAD
A THUG ON YOUR PAYROLL?

25:29.828 --> 25:33.564
17 INDICTMENTS FOR EXTORTION,
FRAUD, MANSLAUGHTER.

25:33.566 --> 25:35.315
NO CONVICTIONS.

25:35.317 --> 25:37.550
17 AND 0.

25:37.552 --> 25:42.255
BESIDES, THE KING IS DEAD.
LONG LIVE THE KING.

25:42.257 --> 25:45.692
I LOST CALVIN, I GAINED
A GREAT WHITE HOPE.

25:45.694 --> 25:48.261
YOU CUT A DEAL
WITH GABRIEL?

25:48.263 --> 25:51.214
GABRIEL AND I SHOOK HANDS.

25:51.216 --> 25:55.018
I TOLD HIM HOW MUCH MORE
A WHITE FIGHTER WAS WORTH TO ME.

25:55.020 --> 25:59.322
TOO BAD THERE'S NO WAY
TO VERIFY THAT.

25:59.324 --> 26:02.792
HE SAID HE HAD TO PASS IT
BY HIS BUSINESS MANAGER.

26:02.794 --> 26:03.893
<i>(Wheeler) WHO?</i>

26:03.895 --> 26:04.894
GUS OR CHRISTINA?

26:04.896 --> 26:06.797
I DON'T ASK.

26:06.799 --> 26:09.365
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH
FOR EVERYONE.

26:09.367 --> 26:11.969
WHEN I HEARD GABRIEL
HAD LEFT THIS EARTH,

26:11.971 --> 26:14.237
I CRIED LIKE A BABY.

26:16.240 --> 26:19.943
YEAH. THAT'S TOUCHING.

26:21.412 --> 26:22.545
I DIDN'T TELL YOU

26:22.547 --> 26:24.881
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT GUS
TO FIND OUT.

26:24.883 --> 26:27.150
GABRIEL
WAS SIGNING WITH GOLD?

26:27.152 --> 26:28.501
HE CALLED THAT NIGHT.

26:28.503 --> 26:32.038
HE THOUGHT HE'D FINALLY GET
HIS SHOT.

26:32.040 --> 26:34.858
AND GABRIEL CONFIDED IN YOU,
NOT IN HIS BROTHER?

26:34.860 --> 26:37.494
HE WAS AFRAID
PETER WOULD TELL GUS.

26:37.496 --> 26:39.345
WHY, BECAUSE
PETER'S LOYAL TO GUS?

26:39.347 --> 26:40.380
GABRIEL WAS TOO.

26:40.382 --> 26:42.282
HE WANTED TO TELL GUS
HIMSELF.

26:42.284 --> 26:43.884
HE SAID
GUS HAD TO BE PROTECTED.

26:43.886 --> 26:45.218
PETER HAD YOU.

26:45.220 --> 26:47.988
GUS WAS THE ONLY FATHER
GABRIEL COULD COUNT ON.

26:50.308 --> 26:53.026
YOU AND GABRIEL WERE CLOSE.

26:53.028 --> 26:55.762
YES. WE TOLD EACH OTHER
EVERYTHING.

26:55.764 --> 26:58.981
LIVING IN THAT HOUSE
WITH THREE GROWN MEN.

26:58.983 --> 27:00.517
THAT WOULD DRIVE ME CRAZY.

27:00.519 --> 27:02.636
DIRTY DISHES,

27:02.638 --> 27:03.803
<i>SOCKS ON THE FLOOR.</i>

27:03.805 --> 27:06.339
WELL, I'M NOT A CAREER WOMAN
LIKE YOU.

27:06.341 --> 27:08.442
I LIKE TO TAKE CARE
OF MY FAMILY.

27:08.444 --> 27:11.144
SO WHY'D YOU MOVE OUT?

27:11.146 --> 27:13.813
THERE'S NOT A LOT
OF EXTRA ROOM IN HERE.

27:13.815 --> 27:15.047
IS THAT WHERE YOU SLEEP?

27:15.049 --> 27:17.183
YEAH. MY SISTER, SHE NEEDED ME.
[phone rings]

27:17.185 --> 27:18.301
EXCUSE ME.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.436
HELLO.

27:20.438 --> 27:21.704
HI.

27:21.706 --> 27:25.642
[speaking Polish]

27:25.644 --> 27:27.644
SHE'S ON HER WAY HOME.

27:27.646 --> 27:30.664
I SHOULD FINISH
THESE CLOTHES.

27:30.666 --> 27:34.067
SO GABRIEL AND CHRISTINA
KEPT THE DEAL A SECRET.

27:34.069 --> 27:37.137
I WONDER WHAT ELSE
THEY KEPT FROM PETER?

27:37.139 --> 27:40.373
HEY, DETECTIVE MIKE LOGAN.
DETECTIVE WHEELER.

27:40.375 --> 27:42.342
WELL, IF YOU NEED CHRISTINA,
SHE'S HOME.

27:42.344 --> 27:44.478
ACTUALLY, WE WERE
JUST INSIDE.

27:44.480 --> 27:46.446
IT MUST BE A REAL GODSEND
TO HAVE HER HERE.

27:46.448 --> 27:48.281
OH, THREE KIDS?
THE WORK NEVER ENDS.

27:48.283 --> 27:49.782
THAT'S WHY YOU
ASKED HER TO COME IN?

27:49.784 --> 27:51.485
OH, NO, I NEVER ASKED.

27:51.487 --> 27:52.618
I MEAN, WE DON'T EVEN HAVE
A ROOM FOR HER.

27:52.620 --> 27:56.089
SHE WANTED TO COME,
I DIDN'T ASK QUESTIONS.

27:56.091 --> 27:57.807
SO SHE CAME ON HER OWN.
DID SHE TELL YOU WHY?

27:57.809 --> 28:01.144
NO. ONE DAY SHE JUST
CALLED OUT OF THE BLUE.

28:01.146 --> 28:02.746
SAID SHE WAS COMING.

28:02.748 --> 28:05.982
GABRIEL, HE HELPED HER
PACK UP AND MOVE IN.

28:05.984 --> 28:08.218
GABRIEL? NOT PETER?

28:08.220 --> 28:10.086
GABRIEL WAS SUCH A SWEETHEART.

28:10.088 --> 28:12.555
HE CAME OVER A LOT.

28:12.557 --> 28:14.991
I THINK HE HAD
A LITTLE CRUSH.

28:18.980 --> 28:20.897
THANK YOU.

28:20.899 --> 28:22.848
WE CHECKED
CHRISTINA'S PHONE RECORDS.

28:22.850 --> 28:24.817
SHE AND GABRIEL
SPOKE EVERY DAY.

28:24.819 --> 28:27.520
AND HER SISTER SAID
THAT SHE AND GABRIEL

28:27.522 --> 28:28.621
WERE VERY CLOSE,

28:28.623 --> 28:31.191
PHYSICALLY AFFECTIONATE,
EVEN HOLDING HANDS.

28:31.193 --> 28:32.892
LOOK, IT'S HIS OWN BROTHER.

28:32.894 --> 28:33.993
HE'S NOT GONNA CHEAT ON HIM.

28:33.995 --> 28:36.529
KEEPING SECRETS,

28:36.531 --> 28:37.580
HE HELPED HER MOVE.

28:37.582 --> 28:39.615
THERE WAS SOME KIND
OF RELATIONSHIP.

28:39.617 --> 28:41.551
PETER THE JEALOUS TYPE?

28:41.553 --> 28:42.786
WELL, I SEE
WHERE THIS IS GOING,

28:42.788 --> 28:44.220
AND I'M TELLING YOU,
NO WAY.

28:44.222 --> 28:46.122
<i>(Wheeler) WELL, LOGAN, WE
KNOW PETER HAS A TEMPER.</i>

28:46.124 --> 28:48.058
WELL, HIS BROTHER
HAS JUST BEEN MURDERED.

28:48.060 --> 28:52.345
YOU HELPED HIM
WITH IMPULSE CONTROL.

28:52.347 --> 28:54.881
KID HAD A JUVIE RECORD.
WHAT'S IN IT?

28:54.883 --> 28:58.334
UH, A COUPLE OF ASSAULTS.

28:58.336 --> 29:00.603
<i>KID STUFF.</i>

29:00.605 --> 29:02.288
HE WAS A TOUGH KID.
HOW BAD?

29:05.025 --> 29:07.093
CLASSMATE ENDED UP
IN THE HOSPITAL.

29:07.095 --> 29:10.096
<i>EVERYBODY LIVED, OKAY?</i>

29:10.098 --> 29:11.782
WAS IT OVER A GIRL?

29:11.784 --> 29:14.017
GABRIEL WAS SET UP, OKAY?

29:14.019 --> 29:17.553
IN MY OPINION, THIS IS A CRIME
OF PREMEDITATION, NOT IMPULSE.

29:17.555 --> 29:20.589
SEXUAL JEALOUSY
IS A POWERFUL EMOTION.

29:22.559 --> 29:24.461
ALL RIGHT. WELL, THEN,
LET ME TALK TO HIM.

29:24.463 --> 29:27.079
WHY DON'T YOU
SIT THIS ONE OUT?

29:30.434 --> 29:33.019
GABRIEL HAD A DEAL WITH GOLD?

29:33.021 --> 29:36.089
NAH. CHRISTINA
WOULD HAVE TOLD ME.

29:36.091 --> 29:39.259
SHE AND GABRIEL
WERE KEEPING SECRETS.

29:39.261 --> 29:41.861
WHY DID SHE MOVE OUT,
PETER?

29:41.863 --> 29:43.913
HER SISTER ASKED HER.

29:43.915 --> 29:45.549
NO, SHE DIDN'T.

29:45.551 --> 29:47.517
CHRISTINA LIVED WITH YOU
FOR FOUR YEARS.

29:47.519 --> 29:48.985
IT WAS HER HOUSE TOO.

29:48.987 --> 29:51.504
SHE SUDDENLY MOVES OUT,
YOU DON'T WONDER WHY?

29:51.506 --> 29:54.658
I-I NEED TO TALK TO HER.

29:54.660 --> 29:56.660
SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN.

29:56.662 --> 29:58.094
NOW, WHAT HAPPENED, PETER?

29:58.096 --> 29:59.663
SOMETHING SHE COULDN'T
TELL YOU ABOUT?

29:59.665 --> 30:00.814
WAS SHE UPSET?

30:00.816 --> 30:03.033
QUIET WITH YOU?

30:03.035 --> 30:04.668
I DON'T KNOW.

30:04.670 --> 30:08.455
<i>(Ross) SOMETIMES THINGS MAKE
SENSE WHEN YOU THINK BACK.</i>

30:08.457 --> 30:11.591
LOOKS BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM,

30:11.593 --> 30:13.926
A TOUCH ON THE HAND,

30:13.928 --> 30:16.246
A LITTLE JUMPY
WHEN YOU WALK IN THE ROOM.

30:16.248 --> 30:19.866
<i>(Wheeler) YOUR BROTHER AND YOUR
GIRL WERE LYING TO YOU, PETER.</i>

30:19.868 --> 30:21.033
NO.

30:21.035 --> 30:22.852
<i>YOUR HEAD</i>
<i>MUST HAVE BEEN EXPLODING.</i>

30:22.854 --> 30:26.022
MIKE TOLD US
ABOUT THAT BOY IN SCHOOL.

30:26.024 --> 30:29.074
YOU BEAT HIM UNCONSCIOUS.

30:29.076 --> 30:30.876
I'M NOT LIKE THAT ANYMORE.

30:30.878 --> 30:33.597
<i>(Ross) PEOPLE DON'T CHANGE.</i>

30:33.599 --> 30:35.532
YOU THINK I DID SOMETHING
TO GABRIEL?

30:35.534 --> 30:37.817
WHY WEREN'T YOU WITH HIM
THAT NIGHT?

30:37.819 --> 30:39.702
YOU SET HIM UP. YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO BE THERE TO SEE HIM DIE.

30:39.704 --> 30:43.940
WE GOT A HOTEL ROOM.

30:43.942 --> 30:47.076
WE...

30:47.078 --> 30:49.012
IT WAS CHRISTINA'S
AND MY ANNIVERSARY.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.746
WE GOT A HOTEL R...

30:50.748 --> 30:52.348
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHERE'S MIKE?

30:52.350 --> 30:54.517
HEY, IF YOU ACTED IN A RAGE,
WE CAN HELP YOU.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.386
NO, NO.
I WANT TO TALK TO MIKE.

30:56.388 --> 30:57.821
YOU BACK THERE?

30:57.823 --> 31:00.456
YOU DON'T THINK I DID THIS,
DO YOU, MIKE?

31:00.458 --> 31:02.842
<i>(Ross) YOUR BROTHER WAS LYING
TO YOU, YOUR GIRLFRIEND LYING.</i>

31:02.844 --> 31:04.261
<i>EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES.</i>

31:04.263 --> 31:05.178
MIKE, I DIDN'T DO THIS!

31:05.180 --> 31:06.312
OKAY, WELL,
HELP YOURSELF OUT.

31:06.314 --> 31:07.681
YOU DON'T KNOW
THE REAL STORY, OKAY?

31:07.683 --> 31:09.382
SO HELP US UNDERSTAND.

31:09.384 --> 31:10.700
THERE IS NO WAY
CHRISTINA AND GABRIEL...

31:10.702 --> 31:13.035
GABRIEL BETRAYED YOU.
YOU SNAPPED.

31:13.037 --> 31:15.104
MIKE, YOU GOTTA
BELIEVE ME, OKAY?

31:15.106 --> 31:16.372
HEY!

31:16.374 --> 31:17.673
<i>(Wheeler)</i>
<i>MIKE CAN'T HELP YOU NOW,</i>

31:17.675 --> 31:19.459
<i>SO YOU'VE GOTTA TELL US</i>
<i>THE TRUTH, PETER.</i>

31:19.461 --> 31:24.664
CHRISTINA AND GABRIEL,
NO WAY.

31:28.635 --> 31:30.403
GABRIEL DIDN'T DATE GIRLS.

31:34.342 --> 31:39.296
GABRIEL DIDN'T... LIKE GIRLS.

31:39.298 --> 31:40.714
NOT THAT WAY.

31:45.069 --> 31:46.853
YOUR BROTHER WAS GAY?

31:46.855 --> 31:48.954
SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

31:51.242 --> 31:53.176
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

31:53.178 --> 31:54.861
THERE ARE NO GAY BOXERS.

31:54.863 --> 31:57.597
YOU CAN'T TELL ANYBODY.

31:57.599 --> 31:58.598
MIKE!

31:58.600 --> 32:01.801
<i>YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME.</i>

32:01.803 --> 32:06.589
MIKE, I DIDN'T DO THIS.
PLEASE.

32:06.591 --> 32:08.608
YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME.

32:15.833 --> 32:18.567
<i>(Ross) PETER'S RIGHT.
THERE ARE NO GAY BOXERS.</i>

32:18.569 --> 32:22.739
EXCEPT MAYBE EMIL GRIFFITH
KILLED BENNY PARET IN THE RING.

32:22.741 --> 32:25.141
PARET CALLED HIM A "MARICON"
AT THE WEIGH-IN.

32:25.143 --> 32:27.159
THERE'S NO WAY PETER'S
MAKING THAT STORY UP.

32:27.161 --> 32:29.194
WELL, IT DOESN'T MEAN
GABRIEL AND CHRISTINA

32:29.196 --> 32:31.348
WEREN'T HAVING
AN EMOTIONAL AFFAIR.

32:31.350 --> 32:33.216
AND SHE MOVED OUT OF THE HOUSE
BECAUSE OF THAT?

32:33.218 --> 32:35.034
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

32:35.036 --> 32:37.470
SHE'S STILL HIDING
SOMETHING FROM US,

32:37.472 --> 32:41.274
SOMETHING SHE DOESN'T WANT PETER
TO KNOW ABOUT.

32:41.276 --> 32:43.593
THEN HOLD HIM.

32:43.595 --> 32:46.796
LET CHRISTINA THINK
HE'S GOING DOWN FOR THE MURDER.

32:52.686 --> 32:54.554
WAIT. WHERE ARE THEY
TAKING PETER?

32:54.556 --> 32:56.155
WE'RE PROCESSING HIM
FOR GABRIEL'S MURDER.

32:56.157 --> 32:57.523
NO, NO, YOU'RE WRONG.

32:59.360 --> 33:00.893
SIT.

33:03.163 --> 33:04.146
FIRST OF ALL,
WE ALREADY KNOW

33:04.148 --> 33:06.249
YOU LIED TO PETER
ABOUT WHY YOU MOVED OUT.

33:06.251 --> 33:07.767
I COULDN'T TELL HIM.

33:07.769 --> 33:08.918
SO YOU'RE HAVING
AN AFFAIR WITH GABRIEL.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.186
PETER FINDS OUT
AND KILLS HIM.

33:10.188 --> 33:13.139
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

33:13.141 --> 33:16.041
NO.
GABRIEL WAS MY FRIEND.

33:16.043 --> 33:17.876
PETER MAY HAVE BELIEVED
DIFFERENTLY.

33:17.878 --> 33:21.581
WHY'D YOU MOVE OUT OF KOVAK'S?

33:21.583 --> 33:23.716
YOUR SISTER DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO MOVE IN.

33:23.718 --> 33:29.773
HEY, PETER
IS ON THE HOOK FOR MURDER,

33:29.775 --> 33:32.491
SO YOU BETTER STOP LYING
RIGHT NOW.

33:39.466 --> 33:41.317
YOU CAN'T TELL PETER.

33:41.319 --> 33:42.485
TELL PETER WHAT?

33:42.487 --> 33:44.053
YOU HAD A FIGHT WITH GUS.

33:44.055 --> 33:46.122
WHAT'D YOU FIGHT ABOUT?
MONEY?

33:46.124 --> 33:48.524
NO.
<i>WHAT?</i>

33:51.378 --> 33:54.314
HE WAS DRUNK.

33:56.166 --> 33:58.534
THE BOYS WERE OUT.

34:00.337 --> 34:02.505
HE SAID HE COULDN'T
STAND IT ANYMORE,

34:02.507 --> 34:04.107
ME IN MY NIGHTGOWN.

34:07.761 --> 34:09.161
HE RAPED YOU?

34:09.163 --> 34:11.047
NO. HE TRIED.

34:13.183 --> 34:15.317
HE SAID IF I TOLD PETER,

34:15.319 --> 34:17.803
HE WOULDN'T TRAIN HIM
ANYMORE.

34:17.804 --> 34:19.672
SO YOU COULDN'T
SAY ANYTHING,

34:19.674 --> 34:21.273
AND YOU COULDN'T RISK
LIVING THERE.

34:21.275 --> 34:24.744
I TOLD GABRIEL.

34:24.746 --> 34:26.913
I HAD TO.

34:26.915 --> 34:29.348
<i>HE HELPED ME MOVE OUT.</i>

34:29.350 --> 34:30.632
<i>HE PROMISED ME</i>

34:30.635 --> 34:32.784
<i>EVERYTHING WAS GOING</i>
<i>TO WORK OUT ALL RIGHT.</i>

34:32.786 --> 34:35.672
<i>YOU CAN'T TELL PETER.</i>

34:35.674 --> 34:38.925
PLEASE, YOU CAN'T TELL HIM.

34:38.927 --> 34:41.761
PETER NEEDS GUS.

34:41.763 --> 34:44.530
HE CAN'T MAKE IT
WITHOUT HIM.

34:49.652 --> 34:52.254
SHE'S LYING.

34:52.255 --> 34:54.190
WELL, HERE'S WHAT
I'M THINKING.

34:54.192 --> 34:56.324
GABRIEL FOUND OUT
WHAT YOU WERE DOING,

34:56.327 --> 34:57.760
AND HE WAS GONNA
TELL PETER.

35:00.280 --> 35:02.214
WAIT A MINUTE.
THEY'RE LIKE MY SONS.

35:02.216 --> 35:04.000
EVERYTHING I DID,
I DID FOR THEM.

35:04.002 --> 35:06.169
MOLESTING CHRISTINA?

35:06.171 --> 35:07.286
YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT
EXACTLY HOW IT HAPPENED.

35:07.288 --> 35:09.755
WELL, SOMETHING HAPPENED.

35:09.757 --> 35:11.256
PETER WAS
TOO ATTACHED TO HER.

35:11.258 --> 35:12.959
HE COULDN'T FOCUS
WHEN SHE WAS AROUND.

35:12.961 --> 35:14.560
SO YOU DROVE HER AWAY.

35:14.562 --> 35:16.980
SHE SOFTENED HIM UP,
JUST LIKE YOUR PARTNER DID.

35:16.982 --> 35:18.747
WHAT? WAIT, I DID WHAT?

35:18.749 --> 35:19.882
YOU CIVILIZED HIM.

35:19.884 --> 35:21.350
YEAH,
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

35:21.352 --> 35:22.552
HE HAD WHAT IT TOOK,

35:22.554 --> 35:24.287
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT,
AND YOU SAT ON HIM.

35:24.289 --> 35:25.588
THAT'S THE WORST THING
THAT CAN HAPPEN TO A BOXER.

35:25.590 --> 35:27.623
THE KID WAS HEADED TO JAIL,
NOT TO A TITLE SHOT.

35:27.625 --> 35:28.924
TITLE SHOT.
THAT'S A BIG WORD.

35:28.926 --> 35:30.226
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT BOXING, HUH?

35:30.228 --> 35:31.727
YOU DO THAT AGAIN,
YOU'RE GOING RIGHT TO JAIL.

35:31.729 --> 35:33.446
<i>(Gus) WHAT THE HELL DO
YOU KNOW ABOUT BOXING?</i>

35:33.448 --> 35:35.198
<i>(Logan) ALL RIGHT,
STEP BACK, STEP BACK.</i>

35:35.200 --> 35:36.533
<i>WHAT'S THE MATTER? YOU AFRAID</i>
<i>YOU AIN'T GOT WHAT IT TAKES?</i>

35:36.535 --> 35:38.100
IF YOU TOUCH ME AGAIN,
I WILL PUT YOUR ASS IN JAIL!

35:38.102 --> 35:39.702
DO IT! DO IT!

35:39.704 --> 35:40.987
HEY, BACKUP'S ON THE WAY.

35:40.989 --> 35:41.937
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

35:41.939 --> 35:43.906
GO AHEAD,
CALL FOR BACKUP.

35:43.908 --> 35:46.158
SCARED TO GET YOUR ASS KICKED
IN FRONT OF YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

35:46.160 --> 35:47.877
<i>(Logan) LET ME TELL
YOU ABOUT YOU, KOVAK.</i>

35:47.879 --> 35:49.728
YOU'RE A BULLY.
YOU DIDN'T TRAIN HIM.

35:49.730 --> 35:50.763
YOU BROKE HIM DOWN.

35:50.765 --> 35:52.464
I BROKE HIM DOWN
TO BUILD HIM BACK UP.

35:52.466 --> 35:54.566
YOU AND GABRIEL
TOOK THE FIGHT OUT OF HIM.

35:54.568 --> 35:57.603
THAT'S WHY
HE COULDN'T CLOSE.

35:57.605 --> 36:02.192
YOU ARE TRULY
OUT OF YOUR MIND.

36:02.194 --> 36:04.260
YOU TOOK AWAY
HIS KILLER INSTINCT.

36:04.262 --> 36:06.062
I GAVE IT BACK TO HIM.

36:06.064 --> 36:10.049
YOU GOTTA LIVE WITH THAT.

36:10.051 --> 36:13.019
NOW THAT GABRIEL'S DEAD,
PETER CAN GO ALL THE WAY.

36:13.021 --> 36:14.921
HEH!

36:16.557 --> 36:19.859
HONEY, TAKE YOUR PARTNER
AND GET OUT OF MY GYM.

36:34.140 --> 36:36.576
CHRISTINA HIRED A LAWYER
FOR PETER.

36:36.578 --> 36:39.979
HE WAS RELEASED
AN HOUR AGO.

36:39.981 --> 36:41.413
DO YOU REMEMBER
PETER SAID

36:41.415 --> 36:43.649
THAT HE AND CHRISTINA
STAYED AT A HOTEL

36:43.651 --> 36:45.785
THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER?

36:45.787 --> 36:49.555
WELL, SHE'S GOT
THE FIRST NICKEL HE EVER MADE.

36:49.557 --> 36:52.859
I WONDER WHO PAID
FOR THAT ROOM?

36:52.861 --> 36:54.426
THAT'S GOOD, BUT YOU GOTTA
KEEP YOUR HANDS UP, OKAY?

36:54.428 --> 36:55.995
BOOM, BOOM. OKAY, TWO.

36:55.997 --> 36:59.616
YO, PETE.

36:59.618 --> 37:00.750
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

37:00.752 --> 37:02.151
WHAT, YOU DON'T THINK
I REMEMBER THIS PLACE?

37:02.153 --> 37:03.836
COACHED HIM HERE FOR TWO YEARS
WHEN HE WAS YOUNGER.

37:03.838 --> 37:05.421
ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME?

37:05.423 --> 37:08.675
THE LAWYER SAID YOU DIDN'T
HAVE NOTHING ON ME.

37:08.677 --> 37:11.427
HOW COULD YOU THINK
I KILLED MY BROTHER, MIKE?

37:11.429 --> 37:13.562
I DON'T THINK YOU KILLED
YOUR BROTHER, PETER.

37:15.049 --> 37:16.398
YOU SAID THE NIGHT
THAT GABRIEL WAS KILLED,

37:16.400 --> 37:18.000
YOU AND CHRISTINA
STAYED AT A HOTEL.

37:18.002 --> 37:20.402
YEAH. WE NEEDED
SOME TIME ALONE.

37:20.404 --> 37:22.722
YOU PAY FOR IT?

37:22.724 --> 37:25.023
UH-HUH.

37:25.025 --> 37:26.508
WHERE'D YOU STAY?

37:26.510 --> 37:28.844
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU KNOW ME WITH NAMES.

37:28.846 --> 37:32.315
WELL, IT WAS YOUR ANNIVERSARY.

37:32.317 --> 37:34.284
EXPENSIVE PLACE?

37:34.286 --> 37:38.321
YEAH, IT WAS REAL NICE.
UH, IN MANHATTAN.

37:38.323 --> 37:40.490
I GOTTA GET BACK TO THE KIDS.

37:47.948 --> 37:50.149
CHRISTINA'S SISTER
WAS RIGHT.

37:50.151 --> 37:51.416
THE DESK CLERK CONFIRMS

37:51.418 --> 37:52.584
CHRISTINA AND PETER
STAYED HERE

37:52.586 --> 37:53.585
THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER.

37:53.587 --> 37:54.653
WHO PAID FOR THE ROOM?

37:54.655 --> 37:56.222
GUS KOVAK,
WITH A CREDIT CARD.

37:56.224 --> 37:57.422
TWO WEEKS IN ADVANCE.

37:57.424 --> 37:59.125
PETER'S STILL
NOT ANSWERING HIS PHONE.

37:59.127 --> 38:00.592
I THINK HE'S ON TO US.

38:08.335 --> 38:11.854
<i>(Logan, voiceover)</i>
<i>I THINK HE'S ON TO US.</i>

38:11.856 --> 38:16.442
YEAH, IT WAS REAL NICE.
UH, IN MANHATTAN.

38:16.444 --> 38:18.377
I GOTTA GET BACK TO THE KIDS.

38:19.980 --> 38:23.733
YOU HELPED HIM
WITH IMPULSE CONTROL.

38:23.735 --> 38:25.001
YOUR HEAD MUST HAVE
BEEN EXPLODING.

38:25.003 --> 38:27.453
MIKE TOLD US
ABOUT THAT BOY IN SCHOOL.

38:27.455 --> 38:30.439
YOU BEAT HIM UNCONSCIOUS.

38:32.259 --> 38:33.775
YOU AND GABRIEL
TOOK THE FIGHT OUT OF HIM.

38:33.777 --> 38:35.878
THAT'S WHY
HE COULDN'T CLOSE.

38:35.880 --> 38:37.547
<i>COULDN'T CLOSE.</i>

38:37.549 --> 38:41.667
GABRIEL'S MANAGER GUS KOVAK
WAS BUYING ROUNDS FOR THE HOUSE.

38:41.669 --> 38:43.569
IT'S FUNNY TO GET A CHAMPION
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

38:45.372 --> 38:47.573
YOU TOOK AWAY
HIS KILLER INSTINCT.

38:47.575 --> 38:51.510
I GAVE IT BACK TO HIM.

38:51.512 --> 38:55.815
NOW THAT GABRIEL'S DEAD,
PETER CAN GO ALL THE WAY.

38:59.737 --> 39:02.321
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING YOURSELF!

39:02.323 --> 39:04.440
THINK GABRIEL WOULD WANT YOU TO
RUN AWAY LIKE THAT IN A FIGHT?

39:06.660 --> 39:07.693
NOW GET BACK IN THERE
AND SHOW ME THE POWER.

39:07.695 --> 39:09.261
SHOW IT TO ME.
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.

I'M TALKING ABOUT.

39:59.930 --> 40:02.665

40:02.667 --> 40:06.652
I NEEDED THE NAMES, MIKE.

40:06.654 --> 40:09.806
OF THE GUYS HE HIRED
TO KILL GABRIEL.

40:09.808 --> 40:12.992
I HIT HIM.
HE WOULDN'T ANSWER.

40:12.994 --> 40:15.862
I HAD TO HIT HIM AGAIN.

40:26.306 --> 40:30.326
<i>(Peter) I GOT THE NAMES.</i>

40:30.328 --> 40:31.410
I WROTE 'EM DOWN.

YOU SHOULD HAVE CALLED ME.
WE HAD HIM.

40:40.520 --> 40:43.256
MY WHOLE LIFE, I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR MY DAD, YOU KNOW?

40:43.258 --> 40:45.958
LOOKING TO COME HOME.

40:45.960 --> 40:47.993
YOU, GUS,

40:51.198 --> 40:54.400
ALL ALONG,
WHO LOOKED OUT FOR ME,
