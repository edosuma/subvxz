WEBVTT

02:57.343 --> 02:59.072
I remember those cheers,

02:59.712 --> 03:01.270
they still ring in my ears,

03:01.414 --> 03:04.212
and for years
they remain in my thoughts,

03:04.350 --> 03:05.647
'cause one night,

03:05.785 --> 03:07.810
I took off my robe,
and what'd I do?

03:07.954 --> 03:10.047
I forgot to wear shorts.

03:11.958 --> 03:15.724
I recall every fall,
every hook, every jab,

03:16.295 --> 03:18.991
the worst way a guy
can get rid of his flab,

03:19.131 --> 03:21.395
as you know,
my life wasn't drab.

03:22.802 --> 03:24.269
Though I'd much...

03:25.304 --> 03:27.568
Though I'd rather hear you
cheer when you delve...

03:27.707 --> 03:30.642
Though I'd rather hear you cheer
when I delve into Shakespeare...

03:31.310 --> 03:33.505
"A horse! A horse!
My kingdom for a horse!"

03:33.646 --> 03:35.580
I haven't had a winner
in six months.

03:40.319 --> 03:43.220
And though I'm no Olivier,
I would much rather...

03:45.324 --> 03:47.918
And though I'm no Olivier,
if he fought Sugar Ray,

03:48.060 --> 03:50.858
he would say that the thing
ain't the ring, it's the play.

03:50.997 --> 03:54.364
So, give me a stage where
this bull here can rage,

03:54.500 --> 03:57.435
and though I can fight,
I'd much rather recite.

03:58.604 --> 04:00.094
That's entertainment.

04:05.745 --> 04:07.144
That's entertainment.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.872
Jake La Motta
and Jimmy Reeves

04:09.015 --> 04:10.482
in the Cleveland Arena.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.575
La Motta is undefeated,
but he's well behind on points.

04:13.719 --> 04:16.779
The Bronx Bull has taken
a lot of punishment in this bout.

04:16.923 --> 04:20.154
Jake is cut around the left eye.
Jimmy Reeves has outboxed him...

04:20.293 --> 04:23.558
Jack, tell me, why the fuck do we
have to come to Cleveland for you

04:23.696 --> 04:24.788
to get beaten by a mulignane?

04:24.931 --> 04:26.796
Come on, do the fuckin' right thing.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.060
He's got you by the balls,
you're outpointed.

04:29.201 --> 04:31.795
You're comin' up for the tenth,
you're gonna have to knock him out.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.065
I want you to bite him, kick him,
do anything you gotta do.

04:34.206 --> 04:36.003
Nobody's lookin',
you know what to do.

04:36.142 --> 04:38.076
Just like home...
all over the fuckin' moolies.

04:38.210 --> 04:40.974
Knock the motherfucker out.
You understand? Knock him out.

04:41.113 --> 04:43.343
Hey, you wanna go in there?
You wanna go in and do it?

04:47.420 --> 04:48.512
Help!

04:50.323 --> 04:52.086
We need a knockout,
let's go get a knockout,

04:52.224 --> 04:53.156
that's where it's at.

04:53.292 --> 04:55.954
Tenth and final round.
Good luck to you both.

04:56.095 --> 04:58.086
La Motta fighting
out of a halfcrouch.

04:58.230 --> 05:00.198
Reeves is up against
a tough fighter,

05:00.333 --> 05:02.267
a man who doesn't know
how to back up.

05:02.401 --> 05:05.928
La Motta continues to bore in,
out of the bob and weave,

05:06.072 --> 05:08.540
hooks a left hand to the jaw,
and Reeves is down!

05:10.276 --> 05:12.540
The crowd is urging Jake on.

05:13.346 --> 05:16.543
The referee is tolling over Reeves.
He's got to get up.

05:16.682 --> 05:19.276
La Motta comes at him once again,
Reeves misses a right,

05:19.418 --> 05:22.285
takes a left, and another left,
a hard left hand to the jaw,

05:22.421 --> 05:24.821
and Reeves is down
for the second time.

05:24.957 --> 05:28.154
A determined Jake La Motta
is making a great comeback

05:28.294 --> 05:29.761
here in the tenth round.

05:31.163 --> 05:33.893
Reeves is up again,
La Motta comes at him.

05:34.033 --> 05:37.161
Aleft hook to the jaw,
another left, and a right to the body.

05:37.303 --> 05:39.897
Three more lefts to the midsection,
a hook on the jaw,

05:40.039 --> 05:43.008
two more lefts to the head,
a right and a left to the jaw.

05:43.142 --> 05:45.110
Reeves goes down
for the third time,

05:45.244 --> 05:47.474
and the referee
is pulling La Motta away.

05:47.613 --> 05:49.581
Two... three...

05:49.715 --> 05:51.182
four... five...

05:51.317 --> 05:53.785
- The referee is counting over Reeves,
- six... seven...

05:53.919 --> 05:55.910
- but time is running out...
- eight... nine...

05:56.055 --> 05:57.522
...and there is the bell.

05:58.257 --> 06:01.693
He can't walk, but Reeves
has been saved by the bell.

06:01.827 --> 06:03.692
But did La Motta
do it soon enough?

06:03.829 --> 06:05.228
Jack, Jack, come here.

06:05.364 --> 06:08.197
It's no good.
This is Ohio, not New York!

06:08.334 --> 06:10.632
- You waited too long!
- That dumb bastard!

06:10.770 --> 06:13.603
Put the robe on right, huh?
Put my robe on right!

06:14.874 --> 06:16.865
Ladies and gentlemen...

06:18.277 --> 06:22.407
...under the rules of
the Ohio Boxing Commission,

06:23.215 --> 06:25.149
after ten rounds,

06:25.851 --> 06:29.810
the winner,
by unanimous decision,

06:31.023 --> 06:33.787
- Jimmy Reeves!
- The colorful Jake La Motta,

06:33.926 --> 06:36.918
the Bronx Bull,
has lost his first fight.

06:40.966 --> 06:44.163
That's Jake's fight!
Come on, that's Jake's fight!

06:44.303 --> 06:45.634
Jake won that fight!

06:45.771 --> 06:48.672
Don't leave. Don't get outta
the fuckin' ring. Stay here.

06:48.808 --> 06:51.606
You won... let him go first.
Stay in, I'm tellin' you.

06:51.744 --> 06:54.406
La Motta floored Reeves
seven times in the fight,

06:54.547 --> 06:56.811
but La Motta still lost the fight.

07:01.987 --> 07:03.852
Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

07:20.039 --> 07:21.028
Help!

07:44.964 --> 07:47.432
...on his fuckin' back,
they pick up his arm, he's dead.

07:47.566 --> 07:50.034
They tell him he won the fight.
People went crazy.

07:50.169 --> 07:53.070
That shit woulda never happened if
Tommy was there takin' care of it.

07:53.205 --> 07:56.402
He's gotta be with Tommy to fight
in New York, to get a title shot.

07:56.542 --> 07:58.442
He's gonna wind up
punch-drunk, your brother.

07:58.577 --> 07:59.771
- I know.
- You know.

07:59.912 --> 08:03.348
You gotta make him understand it's
the best thing for everybody involved.

08:03.482 --> 08:05.347
- I said I know.
- You know,

08:05.484 --> 08:08.078
but you gotta make him know,
make him understand it.

08:08.220 --> 08:09.517
Jesus Christ, you wanna stop?

08:09.655 --> 08:11.520
When the fuck
you gonna stop with that stuff?

08:11.657 --> 08:13.454
I told ya,
I understand everything.

08:13.592 --> 08:15.526
He just wants to do
things for himself.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.526
- Hard to understand?
- It's because he's got a head

08:17.663 --> 08:19.528
- like concrete.
- You make me laugh.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.724
You think it's easy?
Why don't you talk to him?

08:21.867 --> 08:23.630
- You know what to say.
- You know I can't talk to him.

08:23.769 --> 08:25.634
- Why can't you talk to him?
- 'Cause he don't like me.

08:25.771 --> 08:27.398
Nobody likes you,
you oughta be used to it.

08:29.375 --> 08:30.467
They knew.

08:31.610 --> 08:33.009
They knew who was the boss.

08:36.881 --> 08:39.476
The judges didn't know. Who knows
what happened with them?

08:40.052 --> 08:41.383
The people knew.

08:42.520 --> 08:45.820
You don't believe me, you thought
I was over there foolin' around, huh?

08:45.958 --> 08:48.893
You thought I was foolin' around,
didn't ya? Tell me the truth.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.928
I ain't doin' no foolin' around.

08:51.063 --> 08:54.191
- That's in your mind.
- Yeah, so what?

08:54.333 --> 08:57.769
That championship belt on me,
that's when I fool around.

09:00.806 --> 09:01.830
Is it done?

09:02.508 --> 09:04.305
No, it's not done.

09:04.443 --> 09:07.105
Don't overcook it.
You overcook it, it's no good.

09:08.247 --> 09:10.340
It defeats its own purpose.

09:14.620 --> 09:17.180
What are you doin'?
I just said don't overcook it.

09:17.323 --> 09:19.348
You're overcookin' it,
bring it over.

09:19.491 --> 09:21.516
- You want your steak?
- Bring it over.

09:22.261 --> 09:23.751
Bring it over!

09:23.896 --> 09:26.956
It's like a piece of charcoal!
Bring it over here!

09:27.099 --> 09:29.465
- You want your steak?
- Yeah, right now!

09:29.602 --> 09:32.230
Good.
There's your stupid steak.

09:32.371 --> 09:34.839
- Can't wait for it to be done?
- No, I can't wait.

09:34.940 --> 09:36.908
Good. Okay? Happy?

09:37.042 --> 09:38.566
- Happy?
- That's all I want.

09:38.711 --> 09:40.542
That's... there, no, more. There.

09:41.580 --> 09:45.243
Botherin' me about a steak, huh?
You're botherin' me about a steak?!

09:45.384 --> 09:47.318
I agree with you.
He should be with Tommy.

09:47.453 --> 09:50.251
If he's in a good mood, I'll talk to him.
What the fuck you want me to do?

09:50.389 --> 09:52.152
Tommy tells me
every day to talk to you

09:52.291 --> 09:53.758
and speak to Jake
to straighten this thing out,

09:53.893 --> 09:55.383
I'm gonna wind up in the middle.

09:55.527 --> 09:56.789
You're in the middle?
I'm his brother.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.090
- He's got me fuckin' nuts.
- You're his brother.

09:59.231 --> 10:01.563
If you can't talk to him,
who's gonna talk to him?

10:03.302 --> 10:05.167
- I'll talk to him.
- Do what you can, that's all.

10:05.304 --> 10:06.999
- That's all I'm askin' you.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

10:07.139 --> 10:09.403
- Let me go up.
- All right? Where you gonna be?

10:09.541 --> 10:11.509
I'll be at the gym
or the other joint, one of the two.

10:11.644 --> 10:13.509
- I'll catch you by the gym.
- All right. Sal?

10:13.646 --> 10:14.613
Yeah?

10:17.416 --> 10:19.509
Complain some more,
I wanna hear.

10:19.652 --> 10:22.519
- Complain? You call those carrots?
- That's right.

10:22.655 --> 10:24.452
- You call that food?
- You ate 'em. Did you eat them?

10:24.590 --> 10:26.251
You call that food?
I got no choice!

10:26.392 --> 10:28.053
- I'm sick of you already!
- I got no choice!

10:28.193 --> 10:32.027
- I can't believe you!
- I got no choice!

10:32.164 --> 10:34.689
You got no choice?
Get away from me!

10:34.833 --> 10:37.097
- Please!
- Get in there. Get in there!

10:37.236 --> 10:39.796
Get your hands off me,
get away from me!

10:39.939 --> 10:41.804
Fuck! I'm sick of you!

10:41.941 --> 10:43.932
What's the matter with you,
you animals?

10:44.076 --> 10:45.600
- What?!
- Jack, come on!

10:45.744 --> 10:47.712
- You animals!
- Come on, huh?

10:47.846 --> 10:49.939
This son of a bitch
is callin' me an animal.

10:50.082 --> 10:52.448
- Hey, you!
- Come on, Jack.

10:52.584 --> 10:55.212
I'm gonna get hold of that dog,
and I'm gonna eat it for lunch!

10:55.354 --> 10:57.754
You hear what I'm sayin'?
You hear me, Larry?

10:57.890 --> 11:01.053
- Larry?
- Crazy animal!

11:01.193 --> 11:03.661
Who's an animal?
Your mother's an animal!

11:03.762 --> 11:05.593
You son of a bitch!

11:05.731 --> 11:08.757
You're gonna find your dog dead
in the hallway tomorrow, ya bum.

11:08.901 --> 11:10.368
- I can't take it!
- The whole block,

11:10.469 --> 11:12.494
- people could hear you.
- I'll kill the whole family.

11:12.638 --> 11:14.162
- Sit down, relax.
- I can't take this anymore!

11:14.306 --> 11:16.171
You break anything
in there, I'm gonna kill ya!

11:16.308 --> 11:19.072
I swear to God, I'm gonna
come in there and kill ya.

11:19.211 --> 11:20.678
Yeah, sure.

11:23.649 --> 11:24.911
You wanna calm down?

11:26.986 --> 11:27.918
Oh, fuck!

11:28.487 --> 11:30.079
What'd I do?

11:31.323 --> 11:34.258
Come on, honey,
let's be friends.

11:34.994 --> 11:37.758
- Truce, all right?
- It's not all right!

11:38.998 --> 11:40.363
You can't, I'm telling you...

11:40.499 --> 11:43.229
you can't fuckin' eat
and drink like an animal,

11:43.369 --> 11:45.599
put up with
this fuckin' brasciole here.

11:45.738 --> 11:47.968
You can't do this.
I'm tellin' ya.

11:48.107 --> 11:51.838
Forget about the Reeves thing,
you got a million other fights comin' up.

11:51.977 --> 11:53.911
You just can't keep doin' this.

11:55.547 --> 11:56.639
What's wrong?

11:59.852 --> 12:01.945
Something's the matter,
what's up?

12:09.628 --> 12:11.425
You know what's botherin' me?

12:13.298 --> 12:14.390
My hands.

12:15.300 --> 12:18.064
Your hands?
What about 'em?

12:19.972 --> 12:23.567
I got these small hands.
I got a little girl's hands.

12:23.709 --> 12:25.802
I got 'em, too.
What's the difference?

12:27.980 --> 12:29.447
Know what that means?

12:30.649 --> 12:32.674
No matter how big I get,
no matter who I fight,

12:32.818 --> 12:36.254
no matter what I do,
I ain't never gonna fight Joe Louis.

12:36.822 --> 12:39.586
That's right, he's a heavyweight,
you're a middleweight.

12:40.325 --> 12:43.055
I ain't never gonna get a chance
to fight the best there is.

12:43.195 --> 12:45.925
And you know somethin'?
I'm better than them.

12:46.065 --> 12:47.965
I ain't never gonna get a chance.

12:50.669 --> 12:52.261
You're asking me what's wrong.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.638
You're crazy to even
think about somethin' like that.

12:57.776 --> 12:59.767
He's a fuckin' heavyweight,
you're a middleweight.

12:59.912 --> 13:03.643
It's impossible, it'll never happen,
so why go crazy thinkin' about it?

13:03.782 --> 13:04.874
It's not normal.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.717
Do me a favor.

13:10.856 --> 13:13.620
- Yeah, what?
- I want you to hit me in the face.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.190
- What?
- I want you to hit me in the face.

13:17.930 --> 13:19.192
Forget about it.

13:19.331 --> 13:21.424
I want you to hit me
in the face, go ahead.

13:21.567 --> 13:24.536
- Take your best shot.
- Forget about it, I ain't doin' it.

13:24.670 --> 13:27.070
We have fights all the time...
are you worried now?

13:27.206 --> 13:28.298
Hit me in the face.
Go ahead.

13:28.440 --> 13:29.737
- No.
- What, are you afraid?

13:29.875 --> 13:30.842
Afraid of what?

13:30.976 --> 13:33.240
Come on, don't be
a little faggot, hit me.

13:34.313 --> 13:37.180
- I ain't a fag.
- Take your best shot, go ahead.

13:37.316 --> 13:40.513
Come on. You gotta be a real jerk,
you want me to punch you in the face.

13:41.320 --> 13:44.687
Did I not tell you just to do it?
Now I'm tellin' you, you gotta do it.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.250
I ain't hittin' ya.

13:47.392 --> 13:50.259
I'm your older brother, Joey.
I'm tellin' ya somethin'.

13:50.395 --> 13:52.158
I know what you said.
I ain't doin' it.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.933
I don't care if you get mad,
I ain't doin' it.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.636
Fuckin' nut.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.531
I'm not doin' it,
I'm not gonna do it.

14:03.775 --> 14:06.335
I don't have any gloves. What am I
gonna hit you with, the table?

14:06.478 --> 14:08.139
- I ain't doin' it.
- Use that over there.

14:08.280 --> 14:11.374
- What?
- That's right, use that.

14:12.518 --> 14:15.715
Wrap it around your hand!
How many times I gotta tell you?

14:15.854 --> 14:17.549
- Not too many more.
- Go ahead.

14:17.689 --> 14:18.951
- You want me to hit you?
- I want you to hit me

14:19.091 --> 14:22.151

to fuckin' lay me out, go ahead.

14:22.294 --> 14:23.226
- You sure?
- Yeah.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.590
- Go ahead.
- All right.

14:24.730 --> 14:26.789
- Harder.
- Yeah?

14:26.932 --> 14:29.560
You throw a punch like
you take it up the ass, come on.

14:29.701 --> 14:31.328
Harder, harder.

14:31.470 --> 14:33.233
- Harder.
- That's hard, you fuck.

14:33.372 --> 14:34.600
- What do you want?
- Take it off.

14:34.773 --> 14:37.105
- Take it off.
- Come on, you wanna stop now?

14:37.242 --> 14:38.470
- That's enough with that...
- Take it off.

14:38.610 --> 14:39.702
Come on.

14:39.845 --> 14:40.937
- Come on.
- Don't fuck around.

14:41.079 --> 14:42.637
- What are you, a girl?
- Oh, girl, huh?

14:42.781 --> 14:44.373
I'm gonna smack you again,
throw it again.

14:44.516 --> 14:45.574
- That's enough.
- Go ahead.

14:45.717 --> 14:47.480
- I said that's enough!
- Harder, harder.

14:47.619 --> 14:50.247
No, your fuckin' cuts
are opening and everything.

14:50.822 --> 14:52.881
What are you tryin' to prove?
What does it prove?

15:09.308 --> 15:10.502
Hey, Vito.

15:15.647 --> 15:17.046
Joey, what's what?

15:18.016 --> 15:19.381

15:27.926 --> 15:29.689
Don't stay here.

15:30.662 --> 15:31.754

15:32.664 --> 15:33.756
Come here.

15:37.169 --> 15:38.966
Yeah, he looks mad, huh?

15:39.104 --> 15:40.264
Looks mad.

15:40.405 --> 15:42.805
Spoke to him yesterday,

15:42.941 --> 15:44.841
You told 'em to come up here?

15:46.111 --> 15:47.203
Answer me when I talk to you.

15:47.346 --> 15:49.109
Yeah, why?
I can't have my friends up here?

15:49.815 --> 15:52.409
- I heard this fucker didn't win the fight.
- Take it easy.

15:52.551 --> 15:54.610
Don't ever bring 'em
up here again, hear me?

15:54.753 --> 15:55.685
Hear me? Come on.

15:56.989 --> 15:59.924

16:16.908 --> 16:19.035
We're gonna go,
I'll call you tomorrow, huh?

16:22.381 --> 16:24.474
Hey, Jake, watch you

16:27.219 --> 16:29.312
How's your wife?

16:29.454 --> 16:31.820

16:31.957 --> 16:33.788
Yeah. Yeah, wave.
They're your friends.

16:33.925 --> 16:37.019
What the fuck is wrong with you?!
You gotta make a fuckin' jerk outta me.

16:37.162 --> 16:40.256
They only came up here 'cause Tommy
told 'em to come up to try to help us.

16:40.399 --> 16:43.300
What's the matter with you, help who?
What's the matter with you?

16:44.469 --> 16:47.063

16:47.639 --> 16:50.164
Is that what youse talkin' about,
takin' my money?

16:50.309 --> 16:52.368
I'm here breakin' my ass, not them.

16:53.145 --> 16:55.375
Don't ever bring 'em

16:55.514 --> 16:56.538

17:29.781 --> 17:31.248
Come on, give me a Coke.

17:34.553 --> 17:37.147
Hey, shove off.
You gonna go to the dance?

17:37.723 --> 17:38.815
Go to the dance?

17:46.631 --> 17:48.531
- Who's that girl over there?
- The one I was talkin' to?

17:48.667 --> 17:49.599
- Yeah.
- The blonde?

17:49.735 --> 17:51.202
- Yeah.
- Vickie, you mean.

17:54.406 --> 17:57.239
- Where's she from?
- She's from the neighborhood,

17:57.376 --> 17:59.401
she's a neighborhood girl.

17:59.544 --> 18:01.444
What's her last name?

18:01.580 --> 18:05.038
Vickie, that's all I know.
They call her Vickie.

18:07.319 --> 18:08.411
She knows them?

18:09.588 --> 18:12.489
She knows them, they know her,
she comes to the pool every day.

18:12.624 --> 18:15.252
Everybody knows each other...
you know how that shit works.

18:15.394 --> 18:17.487
- She go with them?
- She don't go with nobody.

18:17.629 --> 18:19.961
She's 15 years old,
where the fuck's she gonna go?

18:20.098 --> 18:21.827
Where ya gonna take her,
the Copacabana?

18:23.435 --> 18:25.027
I heard there was
a girl that he went with

18:25.170 --> 18:27.195
that was a very beautiful
young girl, blonde.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.037
- Yeah?
- It's not her?

18:31.109 --> 18:32.838
I doubt it very much.

18:32.978 --> 18:35.173
What are you
thinkin' about, anyway?

18:35.313 --> 18:37.713
She ain't the kinda girl
you just fuck and forget about.

18:37.849 --> 18:39.316
Joey, how many times
I gotta tell ya?

18:39.451 --> 18:41.942
Why are you always cursin'
when I'm talkin' to you?

18:42.087 --> 18:44.885
Don't do it around me.
Do it around your friends.

18:45.023 --> 18:47.617
- It's that thing, just don't do it.
- All right, she's...

18:47.759 --> 18:50.694
The kinda girl you bang
and forget about... she's not like that.

18:50.829 --> 18:53.389
You gotta spend time
with her, get involved.

18:53.532 --> 18:54.726
You know, it's...

18:56.802 --> 18:58.064
D'you bang her?

18:58.203 --> 19:00.228
- No.
- Tell me the truth.

19:00.372 --> 19:02.772
I just told you the truth.
I tell you the truth the first time,

19:02.908 --> 19:04.842
you don't have to ask me again,
I never do that.

19:04.976 --> 19:08.036
I always tell you the truth.
If I did it, you would know.

19:09.247 --> 19:11.477
I took her out
a couple of times.

19:11.616 --> 19:13.948
You went with her?
You didn't try to fuck her?

19:14.085 --> 19:16.110
I try to fuck anything,
you know that.

19:16.254 --> 19:18.518
- She didn't go with you?
- No, she didn't go for it.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.284
- Naturally.
- Naturally?

19:20.425 --> 19:22.620
- She knew better.
- What do you mean, she knew better?

19:23.361 --> 19:24.385
She knew you were an animal,

19:24.529 --> 19:26.463
she knew it was no good
if you'd go with her.

19:26.598 --> 19:28.361
Her reputation would be ruined.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.268
I thought he was
talkin' to you, Vickie.

19:31.870 --> 19:33.337
- That's...
- That's the same guy?

19:33.438 --> 19:35.133
- Yeah, it's the same guy.
- I gotta break his legs.

19:35.273 --> 19:36.240
He was over here yesterday.

19:36.374 --> 19:37.636
- He was here yesterday?
- You missed him.

19:37.776 --> 19:40.142
I was up to the house yesterday.
Didn't know he was over here.

19:40.278 --> 19:42.542
- You stay in there, I'll go find him.
- No, I can catch him.

19:42.681 --> 19:45.650
Your friends, they're in a huddle.
Big business meeting.

19:46.718 --> 19:48.709
Come by the pool,
they sit around and talk.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.414
Big deals.
They make sure she can hear.

19:52.624 --> 19:55.957
Hey, like the big man.
Get the fuck outta here.

19:56.962 --> 19:58.896
Where you goin',
gettin' in the water?

19:59.030 --> 20:00.361
Don't get your hair wet.

20:03.635 --> 20:04.727
Big shot.

20:06.304 --> 20:09.068
Get him alone in the back room,
smack him around, no more big shot...

20:09.207 --> 20:10.469
without his gun.

20:12.143 --> 20:14.407
Yeah, real tough guys.

20:16.314 --> 20:19.249
- They're all tough guys.
- What are you thinkin' about?

20:19.384 --> 20:22.911
Keep lookin'. Where the fuck you goin'?
You're dead, you're married.

20:23.054 --> 20:26.922
You're a married man, it's all over.
Leave the young girls for me.

20:31.329 --> 20:32.421
Big shot.

20:38.003 --> 20:40.096
Let's get outta here.
You gonna stay here all night?

20:40.238 --> 20:41.330
We'll never get through.

20:42.073 --> 20:43.665
Where the hell do you think
you're goin' at this hour?

20:43.808 --> 20:45.776
What are you, a cop?
I'm goin' out. Business.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.936
Fuckin' worm.
You go out, I'm goin' out.

20:48.079 --> 20:49.671
Do what you're gonna do,
what do I care?

20:49.814 --> 20:50.746
Run out, see if I care.

20:50.882 --> 20:52.611
I'm not gonna be here
when you get back!

20:52.751 --> 20:53.843
Fuckin' bunch of guineas.

20:53.985 --> 20:55.452
- You're always hangin' out together!
- Why don't you stop already?

20:55.554 --> 20:57.545
Why don't you fuckin' stop?
You're not goin' on business.

20:57.689 --> 20:59.884
- You're goin' to suck each other off!
- Why don't you have some respect?

21:00.025 --> 21:02.220
- The whole buildin' hears ya.
- Suck him! Suck him, baby!

21:02.360 --> 21:05.761
Hey, Larry! Now you got
somethin' to talk about

21:05.897 --> 21:08.229
with that fuckin' dog,
and this one up there.

21:08.366 --> 21:10.459
Fuckin' Jew cunt, why don't you
hit her in the head with a bat?

21:10.602 --> 21:12.001
Don't call her no names,
she's still my wife.

21:12.137 --> 21:13.866
- How much abuse you wanna take?
- I hit her enough.

21:14.005 --> 21:15.563
- What am I supposed to do?
- Kill the fuck.

21:15.707 --> 21:18.073
Go ahead!
Just leave me here like a dog!

21:18.209 --> 21:20.973
You and your fuckin' ass...

21:21.112 --> 21:23.706
- What's the matter with you?!
- What the fuck's the matter with you?

21:23.848 --> 21:25.179
- You gotta leave me here?!
- You let the whole block hear you.

21:25.317 --> 21:28.184

- I could give a shit, ya fuckin' queer!

21:28.320 --> 21:29.947
- Faggot! Go stick it up his ass!

21:37.462 --> 21:39.555
Oh! Beans!

21:41.666 --> 21:42.758
Jack.

21:50.675 --> 21:53.075
Beansy got a table in the back,
he said we could sit with them.

21:53.211 --> 21:54.701
Beansy who?
Which Beansy?

21:54.846 --> 21:56.473
- Huh?
- Beansy who?

21:56.615 --> 21:58.207
Beans, you know,
he's one of the guys.

21:58.350 --> 22:00.545
- You'll know him when you see him.
- She'll be over there?

22:00.685 --> 22:03.051
I don't know, but you could see
from there, at least.

22:03.188 --> 22:06.555
- Come on, let's go.
- I don't wanna look too hard.

22:15.300 --> 22:16.824
- Hello, Joe. How you doin'?
- Beansy, what is it?

22:16.968 --> 22:17.935

22:18.069 --> 22:20.367

22:33.218 --> 22:35.812

23:08.286 --> 23:09.218
Go ahead.

23:56.167 --> 23:58.362
Get the fuck out,

23:58.503 --> 23:59.970
Get out! Get out!

24:04.275 --> 24:06.641

Hey, Vickie!

24:20.458 --> 24:21.948

24:47.919 --> 24:51.514
Vickie, this is my brother Jake.
He's gonna be the next champ.

24:51.656 --> 24:52.748
Hi.

24:53.491 --> 24:54.583
How you doin'?

24:57.162 --> 24:58.254
Nice to meet you.

25:01.666 --> 25:05.033
- Nice car.
- You like that car?

25:05.603 --> 25:07.002
Yeah. It's nice.

25:17.115 --> 25:18.207
Where you from?

25:19.751 --> 25:20.843
Around here.

25:23.288 --> 25:24.915
You wanna go for a ride?

25:27.959 --> 25:31.725
All right. Gotta give me a few minutes,
I have to change, okay?

25:32.964 --> 25:34.056
- All right?
- All right.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.689
- I'll be back in a little while
- I'll be over there.

25:35.834 --> 25:36.926
Okay.

25:45.310 --> 25:46.402
Move over.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.351
- I never played this game.
- Go ahead.

26:01.492 --> 26:04.928
It's the only way you're gonna learn.
Here, I'll show you how to do it.

26:07.432 --> 26:08.797
That's the way, that's right.

26:08.933 --> 26:10.025
- Like this?
- Yeah, that's right.

26:10.168 --> 26:11.795
- Hit it?
- Just hit it nice.

26:11.936 --> 26:13.301
Hit the middle one.

26:26.784 --> 26:27.876
You see it?

26:29.821 --> 26:30.913
No.

26:46.804 --> 26:48.271
What does that mean?

26:49.807 --> 26:51.274
It means the game is over.

26:52.310 --> 26:53.572
Come on, let's go.

26:56.648 --> 26:57.910
Daddy?

27:05.423 --> 27:07.687
Dad?
Come on in.

27:11.930 --> 27:14.660
Probably went shoppin'
or somethin', let me see.

27:22.106 --> 27:24.574
Yeah, he must have
went shoppin'. Sit down.

27:29.447 --> 27:31.381
- You want somethin' to eat?
- No.

27:31.516 --> 27:33.279
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

27:43.962 --> 27:45.224
Salute.

28:01.646 --> 28:04.672
Why don't you sit over here?
Sit a little closer.

28:06.084 --> 28:08.848
You're so far away, like you're
on the other side of the room.

28:27.772 --> 28:29.933
Come here,
come here.

28:30.074 --> 28:32.008
Come here.
Sit over here.

28:32.143 --> 28:33.872
Come on,
come up from there.

28:38.783 --> 28:39.807
That's better.

28:43.621 --> 28:45.418
No, thank you anyway.

28:47.625 --> 28:48.922
Some water?

28:59.303 --> 29:01.100
Wanna see the rest
of the place?

29:02.407 --> 29:03.431
All right.

29:03.574 --> 29:06.042
I bought it for my father.
I bought the building.

29:06.144 --> 29:07.236
Oh, yeah?

29:08.913 --> 29:11.677
- From fightin'?
- Yeah.

29:13.251 --> 29:14.343
What else?

29:22.593 --> 29:23.855
This is the dining room.

29:26.097 --> 29:27.564
That's a bird.

29:27.665 --> 29:30.133
It was a bird.
It's dead now, I think.

29:43.781 --> 29:44.873
The restroom.

29:53.624 --> 29:54.591
Sit down.

30:15.646 --> 30:18.240
That's me and my brother.
We were foolin' around.

30:18.382 --> 30:19.644
I know.

30:21.152 --> 30:22.449
You look good, though.

30:28.993 --> 30:30.460
What are you smilin' about?

30:31.329 --> 30:32.421
I don't know.

30:39.003 --> 30:40.766
You know how beautiful you are?

30:42.840 --> 30:44.603
Anybody ever tell you
how beautiful you are?

30:44.742 --> 30:46.471
Yeah, they tell you
all the time.

31:24.182 --> 31:26.514
Sugar Ray Robinson
and Jake La Motta in Detroit

31:26.651 --> 31:27.845
for their second fight.

31:27.985 --> 31:29.919
The undefeated Sugar Ray
defeated Jake

31:30.054 --> 31:32.579
at Madison Square Garden
last October.

31:33.324 --> 31:35.258
You can see the contrast
in their styles...

31:35.393 --> 31:38.521
the speedy Ray Robinson
up on his toes, the dancing master.

31:38.663 --> 31:41.655
La Motta the brawler
moves in flat-footed most of the time.

31:41.799 --> 31:43.562
Now he's hurt Robinson.

31:45.403 --> 31:46.927
La Motta coming
at Robinson again,

31:47.071 --> 31:49.130
both hands to the head.
A left and a right to the jaw.

31:49.273 --> 31:51.969
A hard left hand to the body
thrown by La Motta.

31:52.109 --> 31:55.840
Round 8, and it's anybody's fight
at this point, 10-rounder.

31:55.980 --> 31:59.006
La Motta drives both hands
to the head, hurts Robinson again.

31:59.150 --> 32:01.618
Hooks the left hand to the jaw,
a right to the body.

32:02.186 --> 32:04.051
Robinson comes back
with a right on the nose,

32:04.188 --> 32:07.282
La Motta drives him across
the ring, a left and a right to the head.

32:07.425 --> 32:10.292
A hard left hand to the body,
and Robinson is driven out of the ring

32:10.428 --> 32:12.453
for the first knockdown of his career.

32:13.598 --> 32:16.692
This is the nearest
Robinson has been to a loss.

32:26.143 --> 32:29.510
The fight nears its end.
La Motta has taken charge of the fight.

32:29.647 --> 32:32.912
The undefeated Sugar Ray...
his winning ways are in jeopardy.

32:33.050 --> 32:36.144
La Motta coming at him again,
La Motta, feigning a left hand.

32:45.663 --> 32:47.187
After ten rounds,

32:47.331 --> 32:51.165
Judge Rossi,
8-2, La Motta.

32:52.503 --> 32:56.166
Judge Murphy,
7-3, La Motta.

32:57.008 --> 32:59.943
La Motta has won the fight!

33:00.077 --> 33:01.874
A unanimous decision
for the Bronx Bull,

33:02.013 --> 33:04.504
Jake La Motta handing
Sugar Ray Robinson

33:04.649 --> 33:08.312
his first loss as a professional
and Robinson doesn't like it.

33:08.452 --> 33:11.580
With this stunning victory,
La Motta broke what was considered

33:11.722 --> 33:14.623
the impossible...
the invincible Sugar Ray's record.

33:14.759 --> 33:16.886
La Motta has proved himself
a great fighter,

33:17.028 --> 33:19.519
and he shouldn't be denied a shot
at the middleweight crown.

33:24.769 --> 33:26.566
You sure we should be doin' this?

33:27.471 --> 33:28.495
Come here.

33:28.639 --> 33:31.107
You said never to touch you
before a fight.

33:33.644 --> 33:35.407
Come here,
before I give you a beatin'.

33:35.546 --> 33:37.912
You said I couldn't.
You've been good for two weeks.

33:38.816 --> 33:39.908
Come here.

33:50.328 --> 33:51.420
Come here.

34:00.137 --> 34:01.468
Touch my boo-boos.

34:08.846 --> 34:09.904
"Boo-ba?"

34:10.047 --> 34:12.880
Boo-boo.
Give the boo-boo a kiss.

34:13.617 --> 34:14.879
Make it better.

34:30.967 --> 34:32.435
Take off my pants.

34:33.971 --> 34:35.734
You know how to
take off my pants?

34:52.989 --> 34:54.321
Now take off the rest.

34:56.494 --> 34:59.395
You made me promise
not to get you excited.

34:59.530 --> 35:00.622
Go ahead, do it.

35:17.948 --> 35:19.540
Take off your panties.

36:07.398 --> 36:08.865
I like the gym smell.

36:10.234 --> 36:11.201
What?

36:13.771 --> 36:15.602
I like the smell of the gym.

36:42.833 --> 36:45.393
No, no, no, no.
Enough, enough.

36:46.303 --> 36:48.771
I can't do any more.
If I do any more, I'll sink it.

36:50.808 --> 36:53.402
I gotta fight Robinson,
I can't fool around.

37:25.943 --> 37:26.932
What are you doin'?

37:27.077 --> 37:29.170
What are you doin'?
What are you doin' to me?

38:06.016 --> 38:07.779
Jake La Motta
and Sugar Ray Robinson

38:07.918 --> 38:09.215
meet for the third time.

38:09.353 --> 38:12.720
These men are unique,
becoming classic rivals.

38:12.856 --> 38:15.450
These two men...
fierce, powerful fighters,

38:15.593 --> 38:18.892
dangerous... so much so that
no other fighter will go near them.

38:19.029 --> 38:21.930
And so, they fight each other,
three weeks apart.

38:22.066 --> 38:23.363
They've each won one,

38:23.500 --> 38:26.697
and they'll probably fight again,
the way it looks now.

38:27.504 --> 38:29.768
They go to close quarters at the bell.

38:34.712 --> 38:37.306
Round 7,
with Sugar Ray well ahead on points.

38:37.448 --> 38:39.211
La Motta may need a knockout.

38:40.951 --> 38:42.145
The left hook to the jaw,

38:42.286 --> 38:45.255
and Robinson is down
for the second time in his career.

38:45.389 --> 38:47.550
He was down
in the last fight, too.

38:47.691 --> 38:50.922
La Motta watches Sugar Ray
take the count from the referee.

38:51.061 --> 38:53.689
- Robinson trying to get up.
...six... seven...

38:53.831 --> 38:56.026
- eight...
- He's up on his feet now,

38:56.166 --> 38:59.135
and the referee is wiping off
his gloves. He is stunned.

39:00.437 --> 39:01.904
La Motta comes at him.

39:02.039 --> 39:05.338
Despite being knocked down,
Robinson is well ahead on points.

39:05.476 --> 39:09.139
He hooks a left to the jaw, a left
and a right to the head by Robinson.

39:10.748 --> 39:12.511
Your attention, fans.

39:12.650 --> 39:14.277
Judge Joe Lanahan

39:14.418 --> 39:18.184
scores it 8-1, 1-even,

39:18.322 --> 39:20.847
in favor
of Sugar Ray Robinson!

39:20.991 --> 39:22.185
Boo! Boo!

39:22.326 --> 39:25.193
A big vote
for Sugar Ray Robinson.

39:25.329 --> 39:28.526
...of 6-2, and 2-even,

39:28.666 --> 39:32.067
for the winner
by unanimous decision,

39:32.202 --> 39:35.660
Sugar Ray Robinson!

39:36.306 --> 39:38.240
Cocksuckers!
I'd like to fuckin'...

39:42.146 --> 39:45.411
- For Christ's sake!
- I'll kill those cocksuckers!

39:46.450 --> 39:47.974
They only gave him
that fuckin' decision

39:48.118 --> 39:50.678
'cause he's goin' in the Army
next week, that's the only reason.

39:50.821 --> 39:53.551
I knocked him down,
I don't know what else I gotta do.

39:53.691 --> 39:56.182
- What the hell I gotta do?
- You won and they robbed ya!

39:56.326 --> 39:58.658
They're miserable,
because their mothers take it up

39:58.796 --> 40:00.286
the fuckin' ass, that's why!

40:02.299 --> 40:05.700
I've done a lot of bad things, Joey.
Maybe it's comin' back to me.

40:07.004 --> 40:09.837
Who knows? I'm a jinx, maybe.
Who the hell knows?

40:10.074 --> 40:12.201
Forget about all that shit...
this was your shot.

40:12.810 --> 40:14.937
They robbed us!
They out and out robbed us!

40:15.079 --> 40:18.276
- It's Vickie, you wanna talk to her?
- I don't wanna talk to nobody.

40:20.317 --> 40:22.717
- Joey, take her home.
- All right.

40:28.792 --> 40:31.090
- You gonna be all right?
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

40:31.228 --> 40:32.354
You sure?

40:32.496 --> 40:34.987
- Make sure she's all right.
- All right.

43:58.835 --> 44:02.362
Yeah, child, I am coming back and bash
you on your head one more time.

44:02.940 --> 44:04.601
Don't ever do
that Janiro bullshit again,

44:04.741 --> 44:06.766
no more deals like that,
you hear what I'm sayin'?

44:06.910 --> 44:08.810
- What are you talkin' about?
- What am I talkin' about?

44:08.946 --> 44:11.141
Look at that... 168 pounds.

44:11.281 --> 44:13.442
- Stop eatin'.
- What's with the smart answers?

44:13.583 --> 44:15.710
I told ya I didn't wanna do it
in the first place, didn't I?

44:15.852 --> 44:16.910
No, you didn't say that.

44:17.054 --> 44:19.921
You're the one that told me
you could get down to 155 pounds.

44:20.057 --> 44:21.888
Where'd I get it?
Did I pull it out of the fuckin' air?

44:22.025 --> 44:23.822
I don't know if I'm gonna
make it down to 155.

44:23.961 --> 44:25.986
I'm lucky I make it to 160.

44:26.129 --> 44:28.461
And on top of that,
you sign me for a fight at 155,

44:28.598 --> 44:31.567
and If I don't make
the 155, I lose $15,000?!

44:31.702 --> 44:33.829
- That's right.
- You're supposed to be a manager!

44:33.971 --> 44:35.461
You're supposed to know
what you're doin'.

44:35.605 --> 44:38.472
- I did just what I wanted to do.
- That's what I'm worried about, you...

44:38.642 --> 44:40.166
- You want a title shot?
- What are ya talkin' about?

44:40.310 --> 44:43.336
- Do you want a title shot?
- What am I, in a circus over here?

44:43.480 --> 44:45.971
I ask him, he's got more sense
about this. What are you doin'?

44:46.116 --> 44:48.346
You been killin' yourself
for three years now, right?

44:48.485 --> 44:52.751
There's nobody's left for you to fight.
Everybody's afraid to fight you.

44:52.889 --> 44:55.255
Along comes this kid Janiro.
He don't know any better.

44:55.392 --> 44:57.883
He's a young kid, up and comin',
he'll fight anybody.

44:58.028 --> 44:59.256
Good, you fight him.

44:59.396 --> 45:02.695
Bust his hole. Tear him apart.
What are you worried about?

45:02.833 --> 45:04.460
What's the biggest thing
you got to worry about?

45:04.601 --> 45:06.432
- I'm worried about the weight.
- You're worried about the weight?

45:06.570 --> 45:08.435
What we arguin' for?
I just said the weight.

45:08.572 --> 45:10.904
Let's say you lose
because of your weight.

45:11.041 --> 45:12.702
Are they gonna think
you're not as tough as you were?

45:12.843 --> 45:14.538
You're not the same fighter?

45:14.678 --> 45:16.373
Good. They'll match you
with all those guys

45:16.513 --> 45:18.242
they were afraid to match
you with you before.

45:18.382 --> 45:21.476
What happens? You'll kill 'em.
And they gotta give you a title shot.

45:21.618 --> 45:24.678
- Bring me coffee, please.
- Why? There's nobody else.

45:24.821 --> 45:25.810
Nobody's left.

45:25.956 --> 45:27.981
- Who they gonna give it to?
- Coffee.

45:28.125 --> 45:29.057
- In a minute.
- You listenin' to me?

45:29.192 --> 45:31.422
- Please, honey, bring me the coffee.
- All right, just a minute.

45:31.561 --> 45:34.792
- How long I gotta wait?!
- Are you listenin'?

45:34.931 --> 45:37.422
Now let's say you win,
you beat Janiro.

45:37.567 --> 45:40.229
Which you definitely
should beat him, right?

45:40.370 --> 45:41.564
- Yeah.
- Right?

45:41.705 --> 45:42.729
- Yeah.
- They still gotta give you

45:42.873 --> 45:45.137
a shot at the title.
You know why?

45:45.275 --> 45:46.765
- Why?
- 'Cause the same thing as before,

45:46.910 --> 45:49.071
there's nobody left,
there ain't nobody around.

45:49.212 --> 45:50.543
They gotta give you the shot.

45:50.680 --> 45:52.841
Ya understand?
If you win, you win.

45:52.983 --> 45:54.541
If you lose, you still win.

45:54.684 --> 45:57.414
There's no way you can lose,
and you do it on your own,

45:57.554 --> 46:00.079
just the way you wanted to do it,
without help from anybody.

46:00.223 --> 46:03.681
Ya understand? Just get down
to 155 pounds, ya fat bastard.

46:03.827 --> 46:07.422
Stop eatin'. What's the problem?
Stop eatin', that's all, you can do it.

46:07.564 --> 46:09.429
You don't understand anything,
do you understand that?

46:09.566 --> 46:11.761
Joey's right, this Janiro
is an up-and-coming fighter,

46:11.902 --> 46:13.426
he's good-lookin', he's popular.

46:13.570 --> 46:15.504
- You beat him now...
- Excuse me, what do you mean,

46:15.639 --> 46:17.539
- good-lookin'?
- I'm not sayin' good-lookin',

46:17.674 --> 46:20.040
- I'm sayin' popular. If you win...
- But what were you just sayin'

46:20.177 --> 46:21.644
- about good-lookin', popular?
- I'm not sayin' anything.

46:21.778 --> 46:24.941
- I'm just tellin' you Joey's right.
- Are you an authority, or what?

46:25.082 --> 46:26.845
- Nothin'...
- Get outta here.

46:26.983 --> 46:29.975
Get outta here.
Take the baby and get outta here.

46:31.455 --> 46:33.582
Everybody all of a sudden's
an authority about this.

46:33.723 --> 46:36.624
Where'd she find out
he's good-lookin', first of all?

46:36.760 --> 46:37.954
She didn't mean nothin'.

46:40.897 --> 46:42.364
Who asked you?

46:42.466 --> 46:44.093
You gonna start with me now?

46:44.234 --> 46:46.168
When people are talkin',
you don't interrupt.

46:46.303 --> 46:49.898
It's none of your business, especially
if it's my brother and his wife.

46:50.040 --> 46:51.371
Ain't got nothin' to do with you.

46:51.508 --> 46:54.068
Get outta here, go inside.
Take the baby inside.

46:54.211 --> 46:57.510
Come on. Let's leave
the grouches here, okay?

46:57.647 --> 47:00.172
- Come on.
- Change her diapers, can't you see?

47:00.317 --> 47:03.047
- She's gonna cry, she stinks.
- You make her cry.

47:03.653 --> 47:07.089
- I'm gonna make you cry.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm. Come on.

47:10.994 --> 47:13.258
- They're a couple of babies.
- 155 pounds...

47:13.396 --> 47:15.296
let's go to the training camp.

47:15.432 --> 47:18.697
No distractions,
no wives, no phone calls.

47:18.835 --> 47:21.599
Nobody around to bother you.
I'll write out your usual schedule,

47:21.738 --> 47:24.366
- your usual diet...
- Listen, I wanna ask you somethin'.

47:24.508 --> 47:27.375
When I'm away, you ever notice
anything funny goin' on with her?

47:27.511 --> 47:29.206
- With who, Vickie?
- Yeah.

47:29.346 --> 47:30.643
Like what?

47:30.780 --> 47:32.714
What do you think I mean?

47:33.617 --> 47:35.881
No, I don't notice anything.

47:36.019 --> 47:38.044
I want you to keep
an eye on her, all right?

47:38.188 --> 47:40.122
For what, Jack?
She don't do anything wrong.

47:40.257 --> 47:43.021
I want you to keep an eye
on her when I'm away, all right?

47:43.160 --> 47:46.061
You just start trouble for nothin',
I'm tellin' ya, you're crackin' up.

47:46.196 --> 47:47.493
I got a reason, right?

47:47.631 --> 47:50.259
You and I both know,
any woman, given the right time,

47:50.400 --> 47:53.233
the right place, the right circumstances,
they'll do anything, right?

47:53.370 --> 47:55.838
I mean, anything's possible.
All right?

47:55.972 --> 47:57.166
- You're right.
- You oughta know.

47:57.307 --> 48:00.606
You're not wrong, but you're pickin'
on this girl, 'cause I saw you before.

48:00.744 --> 48:02.336
You're worried about your weight,
you're gettin' aggravated,

48:02.479 --> 48:06.006
and you tell her, "What are you?
Go inside. Who asked ya?"

48:06.149 --> 48:08.617
Botherin' her for that, you're gonna
give her an excuse to go out.

48:09.319 --> 48:11.787
- She was talkin' about a guy.
- So?

48:11.922 --> 48:14.083
So what? She was talkin'
on your behalf, she wasn't...

48:14.224 --> 48:17.159
On my behalf? She was talkin' about
a pretty kid, sayin' he's good-lookin'.

48:17.294 --> 48:18.318
What are you talkin' about?

48:18.461 --> 48:20.122
So you make him ugly,
what's the difference?

48:20.263 --> 48:21.491
- That's why?
- Never mind, just do it.

48:21.631 --> 48:22.563
All right.

48:24.100 --> 48:27.035
You know what you should do?
Go inside and be nice to her.

48:27.170 --> 48:28.694
Make up with her.

48:28.838 --> 48:30.897
Tell her you're gonna
take her out, we'll go out.

48:31.041 --> 48:32.770
You wanna go out before
you go away, don't you?

48:32.909 --> 48:34.274
This way, you go away
with a clear head.

48:34.411 --> 48:35.378
You know you took her out,

48:35.512 --> 48:37.776
you wined and dined her,
you had a good time.

48:37.914 --> 48:38.846
All right?

48:39.416 --> 48:41.976
All right.
Where do you wanna go?

48:42.118 --> 48:44.643
- Well, "out" out, you know.
- All right.

48:44.788 --> 48:48.053
Listen, though, if you tell her now,
pull her on the side.

48:48.191 --> 48:50.318
Don't say nothin'
in front of Lenore...

48:50.460 --> 48:52.428
- 'cause I'm not takin' her.
- It's on your head.

48:52.562 --> 48:54.689
- All right.
- We can go without her.

48:54.831 --> 48:57.629
- Do what you're gonna do.
- Oh, I am.

49:02.272 --> 49:03.364
Come here.

49:29.699 --> 49:30.631
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

49:30.767 --> 49:32.860
it's great to be back
in the Copa Lounge.

49:33.003 --> 49:34.300
What a great audience.

49:34.437 --> 49:37.372
Come on, lady, laugh it up...
I laughed when you come in.

49:38.775 --> 49:42.302
But seriously speakin', folks,
we have a special guest with us tonight.

49:42.445 --> 49:46.313
I'd like to introduce the world's
leading middleweight contender,

49:46.449 --> 49:49.111
the Bronx Bull,
the raging bull.

49:49.252 --> 49:52.710
Let's hear it for the great
Jake La Motta, ladies and gentlemen.

49:58.561 --> 49:59.926
What's your name again?

50:00.063 --> 50:02.531
- Janet.
- Janet, sorry, yeah, just been...

50:03.199 --> 50:05.429
It's, uh, toast time.

50:07.370 --> 50:11.534
He hits me with a left hook...
no hand, just a hook he had.

50:12.809 --> 50:15.073
- Where you goin'?
- Goin' to the bathroom.

50:19.549 --> 50:20.880
Hey, Vickie.

50:21.017 --> 50:22.644
- Hi.
- Gee, you're lookin' great.

50:22.786 --> 50:23.912
- Thanks.
- Joe here?

50:24.054 --> 50:25.521
Yeah, they're over there.
Jake's here, too.

50:25.622 --> 50:27.317
That's great.
Listen, I'm over here

50:27.457 --> 50:28.924
with Tommy
and some of the old gang.

50:29.059 --> 50:30.526
You get a chance,
come over and have a drink.

50:30.660 --> 50:31.752
See ya later.

50:34.531 --> 50:37.500
- Hello, Jake, how are you?
- How you doin'?

50:37.634 --> 50:39.158
You're not drinkin', are ya?

50:40.337 --> 50:42.931
- Joey, how are ya?
- How you doin', Sal?

50:43.073 --> 50:45.268
Look like you're havin'
a ball over here.

50:45.408 --> 50:46.500
I'm over there with Tommy Como.

50:46.643 --> 50:47.803
Why don't you come over
and have a drink?

50:47.944 --> 50:50.469
Tommy's here?
I didn't even see him come in.

50:50.613 --> 50:52.137
Charlie Rocks,
what are we gonna do here?

50:52.282 --> 50:53.909
What you got?
What's the odds?

50:58.288 --> 50:59.846
I'll see you later, Joey.

51:00.523 --> 51:03.117
Hey, that's some suit.
He looks good, huh, Jack?

51:06.029 --> 51:08.691
I thought that was my best joke.

51:13.470 --> 51:14.732
Rita, Look who's here.

51:14.871 --> 51:17.339
Hi, Vickie.

51:17.440 --> 51:18.532
Hey, Vickie.

51:18.675 --> 51:20.939
- Say hello to Tommy.
- How are ya, honey?

51:21.077 --> 51:23.910
Good to see ya.
Say hello to Charlie.

51:24.047 --> 51:26.106
- Sit down, have a drink.
- I can't, I have to get back to Jake.

51:26.249 --> 51:29.946
- I just came by to say hello.
- All right, honey, thanks for comin' by.

51:30.086 --> 51:33.852
- Not a bad kid, that Vickie, ya know.
- She's with that fuckin' gorilla.

51:33.990 --> 51:35.821
She must've caught
a hundred beatin's off that guy.

51:39.396 --> 51:42.661
- What took ya so long?
- I went by Tommy's table to say hello.

51:42.799 --> 51:45.996
I saw you say hello to them all.
But what took ya so long?

51:46.803 --> 51:49.931
Nothin', I said hello.
I came back.

51:50.573 --> 51:53.508
- What else did you say?
- He asked me if I wanted a drink.

51:53.643 --> 51:56.578
I said, "No, Jake and Joey
are over there," and I left.

51:56.713 --> 51:58.772
What were you talkin' to Salvy for?

51:59.516 --> 52:01.711
He asked me if Joey was there,
I said, "He's over there."

52:01.851 --> 52:04.945
Then he said, "Tommy's over there,
why don't you go say hello?" And I did.

52:06.189 --> 52:07.781
Are you interested in him?

52:07.924 --> 52:09.892
No, why would I be
interested in him?

52:10.026 --> 52:11.891
You sure you're not interested in him?

52:12.028 --> 52:12.960
Yeah.

52:14.364 --> 52:16.958
In other words, you're not interested
in him, but you could be interested

52:17.100 --> 52:20.433
- in somebody?
- Jake, don't start.

52:20.570 --> 52:23.664
What do you gotta? Hey, shut up,
or I'm gonna smack you in the face.

52:23.807 --> 52:25.468
You embarrass me.

52:25.608 --> 52:28.202
These are from Mr. Como.

52:31.981 --> 52:33.278
Shall I take the?

52:34.150 --> 52:35.708
- What?
- Should I take this?

52:35.852 --> 52:37.717
- Are you finished?
- I'm not through with it.

52:37.854 --> 52:40.379
- Okay.
- These are the jokes, folks.

52:40.523 --> 52:44.482
I tell ya the truth, it's so...
Hi, how are ya, you bald-headed fag?

52:48.531 --> 52:50.761
- Hey, Joey.
- Tommy, thanks for the drinks.

52:50.900 --> 52:52.492
- Come on, any time.
- Charlie, how are ya?

52:52.635 --> 52:54.364
How you doin', Joey?
How's everything?

52:54.504 --> 52:56.870
- Where's Jake?
- He's over there, he don't wanna come.

53:00.109 --> 53:02.634
- If you call him, he'll come.
- All right.

53:05.181 --> 53:07.149
- I'll be right back.
- Here he comes.

53:07.283 --> 53:09.148
What is it?
You don't call anybody anymore.

53:09.285 --> 53:12.550
We never see ya anymore.
For cryin' out loud.

53:12.689 --> 53:16.147
You never come around anymore?
You can't even make a call? What is it?

53:16.359 --> 53:18.691
I'm busy,
I'm goin' away fightin', I'm busy.

53:18.828 --> 53:22.059
Busy, busy.
Look at him takin' me seriously.

53:22.198 --> 53:24.894
I'm only kiddin' you,
what a fuckin' kid.

53:25.034 --> 53:27.229
- That's the best fuckin' fighter around.
- Hey, Jake.

53:27.370 --> 53:29.304
- How you doin'?
- Them mulignanes,

53:29.439 --> 53:31.907
forget about it,
they're all afraid to fight you.

53:32.008 --> 53:34.203
- How you feelin', all right?
- I'm all right.

53:34.344 --> 53:37.040
- Good? Strong?
- Strong, yeah. I'm doin' okay.

53:37.180 --> 53:39.410
Then Janiro's gotta
watch his ass, right?

53:40.283 --> 53:41.307
I think he should.

53:41.818 --> 53:44.082
Last three, four times,
I won nothin' but money with the guy.

53:44.220 --> 53:46.245
He's no piece of cake,
that's a good fighter.

53:46.389 --> 53:48.448
Very attractive guy.
All the girls like him.

53:48.591 --> 53:50.582
No marks, clean.

53:53.329 --> 53:55.695
Jake, am I wrong?
Did you gain a few pounds?

53:55.832 --> 53:58.528
A few pounds. I'll knock it off
right away, though, no problem.

53:58.668 --> 54:00.397
Right off, right off.

54:01.671 --> 54:05.971
Look, let me ask you somethin'.
I'm just talkin' now, just talkin'.

54:06.109 --> 54:09.875
I come to you, and I'm tellin' you
that I'm gonna bet a lot of money on you

54:10.013 --> 54:12.345
in this fight with Janiro, right?

54:12.482 --> 54:13.574
Yeah?

54:14.150 --> 54:17.551
What would you tell me?
What could you say to me?

54:17.687 --> 54:19.621
I would say
bet everything you got.

54:20.189 --> 54:21.952
- Everything?
- Everything.

54:22.959 --> 54:24.722
'Cause I'm gonna
open his hole like this.

54:24.861 --> 54:26.453
Excuse my French, girls.

54:27.597 --> 54:30.464
- I'm gonna make him suffer.
- What's wrong with this guy?

54:30.600 --> 54:33.728
I'm gonna make his mother wish
she never had him.

54:33.870 --> 54:36.236
- Is this somethin' personal?
- Make him into dog meat. What?

54:36.372 --> 54:39.273
- Did he say somethin' in the papers?
- No, he's a nice kid.

54:39.409 --> 54:40.933
He's a pretty kid, too.

54:41.077 --> 54:44.171
I don't know, I got a problem...
if I should fuck him or fight him.

54:45.949 --> 54:49.316
Must be crazy.
Fuck him or fight him.

54:49.452 --> 54:52.683
You're really liable to get fucked
with this kid, watch out.

54:52.822 --> 54:54.346
- By who?
- Janiro.

54:54.490 --> 54:56.515
You mean you want me
to get him to fuck you?

54:56.659 --> 54:57.648
- Me?
- Yeah.

54:57.794 --> 55:00.388
- No, I don't want him to fuck me.
- I could do that easily.

55:00.530 --> 55:01.462
How you gonna do that?

55:01.598 --> 55:03.759
I'll get youse both in the ring
and give youse both a fuckin' beatin',

55:03.900 --> 55:05.424
and you both could fuck each other.

55:06.669 --> 55:09.638
- I'll get all full of blood.
- You're used to that.

55:11.641 --> 55:14.007
Come on, drink up.
That's ginger ale, Jake.

55:14.143 --> 55:15.770
- Come on, salute.
- Salute.

55:16.546 --> 55:18.514
- Jake, good luck.
- Salute. Good luck, Jake.

55:55.818 --> 55:57.376
Hey, Vick.

56:01.324 --> 56:03.622
- What?
- You awake?

56:04.694 --> 56:05.752
No.

56:08.264 --> 56:11.165
- Can you hear me?
- What?

56:16.773 --> 56:18.536
You ever think
of anybody else...

56:20.610 --> 56:21.872
when we're in bed?

56:22.945 --> 56:25.470
- What do you mean?
- You know, when we make love.

56:27.116 --> 56:29.141
No, nobody, I love you.

56:31.054 --> 56:33.318
How come you said
that thing about Janiro?

56:34.457 --> 56:37.722
- What did I say?
- You said he had a pretty face.

56:38.961 --> 56:40.690
I never noticed his face.

56:41.964 --> 56:43.898
How come you said that, then?

56:45.635 --> 56:49.230
I don't even know what I said.
I don't even know what he looks like.

56:50.139 --> 56:51.401
Go to sleep.

58:07.817 --> 58:11.253
- He ain't pretty no more.
- He really messed him up.

58:14.157 --> 58:17.615
And the winner
by unanimous decision

58:17.760 --> 58:21.389
in ten rounds,
Jake La Motta!

58:46.255 --> 58:49.520
Give me a little piece of ice,
just a sliver, just for my tongue.

58:50.159 --> 58:52.923
- No water!
- Come on, I'm dyin'.

58:53.763 --> 58:55.526
Fuckin' hard-on.

58:57.466 --> 58:58.831
Four pounds.

58:59.402 --> 59:01.927
Keep workin'.
Cut the bullshit.

59:09.712 --> 59:11.737
I saw him fight with Janiro,
I couldn't believe it...

59:11.881 --> 59:13.940
destroyed this guy,
it was absolutely incredible.

59:14.083 --> 59:16.347
He knocked his nose from
one side of his face to the other.

59:16.485 --> 59:19.079
- You've gotta be kiddin'.
- Fuckin' thing was hangin' off.

59:19.222 --> 59:21.349
Who you fightin' next?
Can you tell me?

59:21.490 --> 59:23.185
I don't know.
You never know these things...

59:23.326 --> 59:26.022
From all I've seen,
they gotta give him that title shot.

59:26.929 --> 59:28.055
Jackie Curtie, Joey.

59:28.197 --> 59:29.494
- You should know each other.
- Hi, Joey.

59:29.632 --> 59:31.497
Pleasure... heard a lot
of nice things about you.

59:31.634 --> 59:32.931
We're gonna get
the title shot, too.

59:33.069 --> 59:35.902
I'm sure. I like your brother.
Made a lot of money on him.

59:36.038 --> 59:37.699
Probably more than he did,
that's for sure.

59:37.840 --> 59:40.035
Made some nice cabbage
on the Oscar Jackson fight.

59:40.610 --> 59:41.838
What ever happened to Oscar?

59:41.978 --> 59:44.572
- Anybody see him anymore?
- He's punchy, he probably died.

59:44.714 --> 59:46.181
Who the fuck cares?

59:46.315 --> 59:47.577
- Make yourselves comfortable.
- It's a beautiful table.

59:47.717 --> 59:49.378
- The worst table in the house.
- And he's complainin'.

59:49.518 --> 59:50.780
It's a beautiful table.

59:50.920 --> 59:53.047
He's workin' downtown,
big building... workin' an elevator.

59:53.189 --> 59:54.486
Happened to be there the other day.

59:54.624 --> 59:57.024
I'm not Italian, I don't care.

59:57.159 --> 59:58.854
- Took me right up.
- Hey, that Oscar's always

59:58.995 --> 01:00:00.986
a stand-up guy, Joey,
he did you a lot of good.

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:02.654
Gave your brother
a hell of a fight, too.

01:00:02.798 --> 01:00:05.699
Yeah, Mickey?
Cutty Sark and water.

01:00:05.835 --> 01:00:06.824
Excuse me one minute, fellas.

01:00:06.969 --> 01:00:08.459
- I'll be right back.
- Come back, Joey.

01:00:08.604 --> 01:00:10.595
Come on back. Okay.

01:00:12.642 --> 01:00:14.109
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:15.370
Hey, Joe.

01:00:15.511 --> 01:00:18.844
- Hey, Joey.
- Look at how he's lookin' at us.

01:00:18.981 --> 01:00:21.176
- Something's happening.
- She's having a problem.

01:00:21.317 --> 01:00:24.878
- You're worried about it?
- I'm just sittin' there havin' a drink!

01:00:25.021 --> 01:00:26.750
- Shut up. Keep your mouth shut.
- Both of youse are the same.

01:00:26.889 --> 01:00:27.856
I feel like I'm a prisoner.

01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:30.959
I can't walk, I look at somebody
the wrong way, I get smacked.

01:00:31.827 --> 01:00:33.590
You think you're right or somethin',
the way you're fuckin' yellin'?

01:00:33.729 --> 01:00:35.094
- I am right.
- You're wrong.

01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:36.926
I am right.
I'm tired of having to turn around

01:00:37.066 --> 01:00:39.125
and havin' both of youse
up my ass all the time.

01:00:40.703 --> 01:00:42.000
- Shut up.
- No.

01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:43.605
- Don't make me...
- I'm tired of listenin' to you

01:00:43.706 --> 01:00:46.732
- and your brother. I'm not wrong.
- Don't make me get nuts in this place.

01:00:46.876 --> 01:00:47.968
What am I supposed to do?

01:00:48.144 --> 01:00:50.271
I'm 20 years old, I gotta go home
and sleep by myself every night?

01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:52.142
- What the fuck did you marry him for?
- 'Cause I love him.

01:00:52.281 --> 01:00:53.908
- You do?
- Yeah, I love him.

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:56.985
What am I supposed to do?
This guy don't even wanna fuck me.

01:00:58.187 --> 01:00:59.711
He's just been
a contender too long.

01:00:59.855 --> 01:01:02.949
He'll be all right as soon as he gets
his shot, and then everything'll be okay.

01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:05.720
You won't have to go fuckin'
runnin' around when he does.

01:01:05.861 --> 01:01:08.193
Jake is never gonna be champ.
Too many people hate him.

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:10.822
- And you're drinking with them!
- And I'm gonna finish my drink

01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:13.731
- and I'm gonna have a good time.
- Get your stuff.

01:01:18.708 --> 01:01:19.902
I said you ain't stayin' here.

01:01:20.042 --> 01:01:21.009
- Get your stuff.
- I'm stayin'.

01:01:21.143 --> 01:01:23.077
You're making an asshole
out of my brother, get your stuff.

01:01:23.212 --> 01:01:24.406
- Come on, relax.
- Shut up.

01:01:24.547 --> 01:01:26.208
Mind your fuckin' business
and shut up.

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:28.909
- You're taking this all wrong.
- I said shut up, didn't I?!

01:01:29.051 --> 01:01:30.916
What's the matter with you?
There's nothin' goin' on here.

01:01:31.053 --> 01:01:33.146
This is innocent.
We're only having a few drinks.

01:01:34.523 --> 01:01:36.684
- Relax, no problem.
- Come on, you know better than that.

01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:40.159
- All right. Let's all calm down.
- Just relax, come on.

01:01:40.296 --> 01:01:41.354
- We've been friends a long time.
- I'm just upset.

01:01:41.497 --> 01:01:44.057
- It's my brother's wife...
- There's nothing goin' on over here.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.167
I'm sorry, I really am.

01:01:45.301 --> 01:01:46.563
We're friends,
we can straighten this...

01:01:47.136 --> 01:01:49.331
Right? Nothing going on?!

01:01:49.472 --> 01:01:52.566
Nothing going on?!
Ya dirty cocksucker!

01:01:56.178 --> 01:01:59.306
- Fuckin' hard-on!
- Get off! Get him off!

01:01:59.448 --> 01:02:02.576
I'll bite your fuckin' head off,
ya cocksucker!

01:02:02.718 --> 01:02:05.585
Get outta here, Joey!
What the fuck are you doin'?!

01:02:06.355 --> 01:02:08.289
- Easy, easy! Come on!
- Get your hands off me!

01:02:08.424 --> 01:02:10.153
- Come on!
- Come on!

01:02:12.361 --> 01:02:13.658
Fuckin' cunt.

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:15.991
Get out! Get outta the way!

01:02:16.632 --> 01:02:19.396
Oh, scumbag!
I'm gonna suck your fuckin' eyes out!

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:24.430
Hey, you fuckin'...
what are you, nuts?!

01:02:24.573 --> 01:02:25.562
Don't mention Tommy.

01:02:25.708 --> 01:02:27.733
You do what you do,
and we do what we gotta do.

01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:29.674
- Don't mention no names.
- No, you're wrong, Joe.

01:02:29.812 --> 01:02:31.803
He's wrong.
No fuckin' trouble in the joint.

01:02:37.753 --> 01:02:40.347
I said get outta here,
ya fuckin' mamone!

01:02:40.489 --> 01:02:43.151
Get back there,
ya fuck, ya!

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.855
Take it easy, people.
Come on, now, take it easy.

01:02:48.164 --> 01:02:50.359
You've had it,
you rat bastard!

01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:10.978
You guys have
a lot of years between you,

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:13.111
and you've done
a lot of things together.

01:03:13.255 --> 01:03:15.815
I understand, Joey,
it was your brother's wife.

01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:16.725
But you don't raise your hands,

01:03:16.725 --> 01:03:17.521
But you don't raise your hands,

01:03:17.726 --> 01:03:20.957
you don't create a scene
like that in a place like that.

01:03:21.097 --> 01:03:23.793
Now, we've heard
everybody's point of view here,

01:03:23.933 --> 01:03:26.060
and we're gonna forget about it.

01:03:26.202 --> 01:03:29.638
I shouldn't forget about it,
but we're gonna forget about it.

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:31.398
Right?

01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:33.565
What I want you to do now,
you two guys,

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:36.769
I want you to shake hands,
forget this whole thing,

01:03:36.912 --> 01:03:38.402
and no grudges.

01:03:38.547 --> 01:03:41.311
That's the most important thing...
no grudges.

01:03:42.318 --> 01:03:44.081
Now, come on, shake hands.

01:03:48.824 --> 01:03:51.292
It's all right with me
if it's all right with you.

01:03:51.393 --> 01:03:52.485
All right?

01:03:53.429 --> 01:03:55.522
I only wish this thing
never happened.

01:03:55.664 --> 01:03:57.461
We all wish it never happened.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:00.694
Right?
You'll get over it.

01:04:00.836 --> 01:04:03.930
Salvy, let me talk
with him alone a minute.

01:04:04.073 --> 01:04:05.165
Yeah, all right.

01:04:07.376 --> 01:04:09.640
I'll see you Monday,
Tuesday or somethin', all right?

01:04:09.778 --> 01:04:11.769
I'm sorry,
I forgot all about it.

01:04:12.348 --> 01:04:15.112
What are you, fucking nuts?
You're killin' me.

01:04:20.055 --> 01:04:22.888
Aside from everything else,
is the family all right?

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:25.755
Yeah, they're fine.
Everybody's fine.

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:31.557
What is it with you?
You can't talk?

01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:33.190
- I'm talkin', what do you mean?
- I know.

01:04:33.335 --> 01:04:36.566
Why have you got this funny attitude?
I can't figure you out.

01:04:37.139 --> 01:04:40.734
What is it with all the quick answers?
"Yeah, they're all right. Yeah."

01:04:41.977 --> 01:04:44.002
You wanna get outta here
fast or something?

01:04:44.146 --> 01:04:45.477
No, it's nothin' like that.

01:04:45.614 --> 01:04:48.481
It's just all the aggravation
and everything and...

01:04:49.084 --> 01:04:50.551
all the fights and all.

01:04:52.321 --> 01:04:54.721
Listen to me.
Now, Jake...

01:04:55.691 --> 01:04:58.251
the guy's become
an embarrassment.

01:04:58.994 --> 01:05:02.088
He's embarrassin' me
with certain people,

01:05:02.231 --> 01:05:04.461
and I'm lookin' very bad.

01:05:05.167 --> 01:05:08.432
I can't deliver a kid from
my own goddamn neighborhood.

01:05:09.004 --> 01:05:10.028
What is it with him?

01:05:10.172 --> 01:05:13.107
Why does he have to make it
so hard on himself?

01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:15.836
He comes to me,
I make it easier for him.

01:05:18.847 --> 01:05:20.940
The man's got a head of rock.

01:05:25.621 --> 01:05:28.385
You know, it's hard
to explain, Tommy, he's...

01:05:29.124 --> 01:05:30.386
Jack respects you.

01:05:30.526 --> 01:05:32.994
I mean, he don't even
say hello to anybody.

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:35.359
You he talks to, he likes you.

01:05:36.899 --> 01:05:39.459
It's just that when he gets
somethin' on his mind,

01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:42.571
he's got a hard head,
he likes to do things his own way.

01:05:42.705 --> 01:05:45.037
Jesus Christ could
come off the cross sometimes,

01:05:45.174 --> 01:05:47.574
he don't give a fuck,
he's gonna do what he wants to do,

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:50.702
he wants to make it on his own.
He thinks he can make it on his own.

01:05:50.846 --> 01:05:52.108
Make it on his own.

01:05:52.248 --> 01:05:57.276
He thinks he's gonna walk in there
and become champion on his own?

01:05:58.053 --> 01:06:00.851
- He's crazy. You know he's nuts.
- Yeah, he's crazy.

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:04.357
And he's got no respect for nobody,
he doesn't listen to nobody.

01:06:04.493 --> 01:06:05.755
That's not crazy.

01:06:05.894 --> 01:06:09.261
- He respects you, though.
- He doesn't respect anybody.

01:06:09.398 --> 01:06:11.491
Now, you do this for me,
you understand?

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:16.799
You tell him I don't care
how colorful he is, how great he is.

01:06:16.939 --> 01:06:18.531
He could beat all
the Sugar Ray Robinsons

01:06:18.674 --> 01:06:20.665
and the Tony Janiros in the world.

01:06:20.809 --> 01:06:24.336
But he ain't gonna get a shot
at that title, not without us, he ain't.

01:06:25.214 --> 01:06:27.273
Now, you're a smart kid.

01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:29.776
You go to him, you tell him...

01:06:34.957 --> 01:06:36.219
Son of a bitch.

01:06:37.293 --> 01:06:38.885
Twenty dollar shoe here.

01:06:46.135 --> 01:06:48.069
Aren't you gonna
ask me what happened?

01:06:52.308 --> 01:06:53.400
What's the matter?

01:06:56.145 --> 01:06:58.739
- What's wrong?
- I remember when I met her here.

01:06:59.815 --> 01:07:01.908
- Who?
- Vickie.

01:07:04.987 --> 01:07:07.922
Why, what's the matter?
What'd she do now?

01:07:11.293 --> 01:07:14.194
I know she's doin' somethin',
I just wanna catch her once.

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:15.422
Just once.

01:07:19.068 --> 01:07:22.003
Hey, Jack.
Wanna do yourself a favor?

01:07:22.571 --> 01:07:24.766
Bust her fuckin' hole,
throw her out.

01:07:25.341 --> 01:07:27.866
Either that, or live with her
and let her ruin your life,

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:29.773
'cause that's what's happenin'.

01:07:32.614 --> 01:07:35.549
How much could you take?
How much shit could you take?

01:07:45.461 --> 01:07:46.985
So, what'd that guy say?

01:07:47.963 --> 01:07:50.557
He gave me the old
"good news, bad news" routine.

01:07:51.133 --> 01:07:52.157
The good news is

01:07:52.301 --> 01:07:54.394
you're gonna get
the shot at the title.

01:07:54.536 --> 01:07:58.734
The bad news is they want you
to do the old flip-flop for them.

01:07:59.875 --> 01:08:01.843
- So, what else is new?
- What'd you expect?

01:08:01.977 --> 01:08:03.376
You didn't know that was comin'?

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.107
You win some,
you lose some.

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:07.715
This one, we're losin'.

01:08:10.052 --> 01:08:11.144
Billy Fox.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:15.486
173 and 3/4 pounds.

01:08:18.093 --> 01:08:22.359
- Jake La Motta. 167...
- I guess you've heard by now

01:08:22.497 --> 01:08:25.729
a lot of the stuff that's
goin' around, a lot of rumors.

01:08:26.301 --> 01:08:29.566
Matter of fact, a short time ago
you were a big favorite,

01:08:29.705 --> 01:08:32.037
and all of a sudden,
you're a 12-5 underdog,

01:08:32.174 --> 01:08:34.142
and people are talkin',
it's as simple as that.

01:08:34.276 --> 01:08:37.040
- That's funny, I never heard anything.
- It's out there, though,

01:08:37.179 --> 01:08:38.203
and It's not good.

01:08:38.346 --> 01:08:40.281
As a matter of fact,
the bets are off on this one.

01:08:40.416 --> 01:08:42.212
Nothin' goin' in this one.

01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:46.151
Matter of fact, smart money is sayin'
that you're getting ready to hit the tank.

01:08:46.287 --> 01:08:48.448
- That's bullshit.
- Yeah, that's bullshit.

01:08:49.457 --> 01:08:50.720
You got any money
you wanna bet?

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:52.383
- Come on.
- I'll take the action, go ahead.

01:08:52.528 --> 01:08:55.292
You bet it on Fox,
'cause I'm gonna win.

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:57.729
There's no way I'm goin' down.
I don't go down for nobody.

01:08:57.866 --> 01:08:59.629
- That's what I wanted to hear.
- I want you to know that.

01:08:59.768 --> 01:09:01.234
- All right.
- All right, Colonel.

01:09:01.336 --> 01:09:02.803
Okay, that's it.

01:09:02.938 --> 01:09:04.234
You came down here just
for that nonsense?

01:09:04.372 --> 01:09:06.033
- That was it?
- That was it.

01:09:16.518 --> 01:09:18.076
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:21.087
Welcome to
the Madison Square Garden

01:09:21.223 --> 01:09:23.282
feature attraction.

01:09:23.425 --> 01:09:27.953
- In this corner, weighing 175 pounds...
- Commissioner, how about a picture?

01:09:28.095 --> 01:09:29.859
Fellas, can we get
a picture over here?

01:09:29.997 --> 01:09:33.764
...the undefeated Billy Fox.

01:09:37.606 --> 01:09:39.631
Hi, Steve. Your brother
got out of the hospital?

01:09:39.774 --> 01:09:42.743
- They think it's all right.
- Did he get out? Good.

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:47.048
- Charlie, let me sit over there.
- Yeah, sure.

01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:51.112
Tommy, what's the matter?
Everything's all right?

01:09:51.252 --> 01:09:52.652
It's all right, yeah.

01:09:52.787 --> 01:09:54.415
Touch gloves now,
come out boxing.

01:09:54.556 --> 01:09:56.319
Five seconds, Alex.

01:10:08.971 --> 01:10:11.633
Come on, stand...
come on, stand up!

01:10:11.773 --> 01:10:14.435
What the fuck you doin'?
Hit me, ya fuckin' bum, come on.

01:10:15.143 --> 01:10:16.235
Come on.

01:10:16.912 --> 01:10:20.279
What are you doin', Jake?!
Come on, box him!

01:10:30.158 --> 01:10:31.921
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

01:10:32.494 --> 01:10:34.519
What do you think
you're doin' out there?!

01:10:34.663 --> 01:10:35.925
- Huh?
- Little slow, that's all.

01:10:36.064 --> 01:10:38.589
- What are you doin' out there?
- Take it easy, he'll be all right.

01:10:38.734 --> 01:10:41.862
He's a little slow. He'll make it up,
what are ya worried about?

01:10:42.004 --> 01:10:45.531
Goddamn it. Come on,
pick it up a little, Jake, I'm sorry.

01:10:45.674 --> 01:10:47.869
Come on, Jake,
I got some money on ya!

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:50.637
- Tank job!
- Hit him back, ya bum!

01:10:50.779 --> 01:10:52.041
- Come on.
- Hit him back!

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:55.916
You fuckin' bum!
You're takin' a dive in the fourth?

01:10:56.485 --> 01:10:58.544
Pocket your dirty money!

01:11:01.123 --> 01:11:03.717
Aw, you phony bastard!
That's a fix!

01:11:03.859 --> 01:11:05.383
We're stoppin' the fight!

01:11:05.994 --> 01:11:09.259
What the fuck are you waitin' for
to stop the fight, ya jerk?!

01:11:09.865 --> 01:11:10.889
And you standin' there.

01:11:11.033 --> 01:11:14.002
- Fuckin' go down, will ya?
- The referee stops this bout

01:11:14.136 --> 01:11:18.800
at 2:23 of the fourth round.

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:22.308
The winner
by technical knockout,

01:11:22.444 --> 01:11:24.571
and still undefeated,

01:11:24.713 --> 01:11:27.682
Billy Fox!

01:11:29.484 --> 01:11:30.951
What'd I do?!

01:11:43.165 --> 01:11:44.189
Don't fight anymore.

01:11:44.333 --> 01:11:47.097
It's a free country,
don't fight anymore.

01:11:48.503 --> 01:11:52.269
Aw, what'd I do?
What'd I do?

01:11:56.678 --> 01:11:58.805
What'd I do?

01:12:05.854 --> 01:12:07.788
- Get outta here!
- Jake has an interview...

01:12:09.858 --> 01:12:12.793
It's all right, Jake.
It's all right.

01:12:14.863 --> 01:12:17.331
Why did I do it? Why?

01:12:18.331 --> 01:12:20.331
(Board suspends LaMotta)

01:12:22.938 --> 01:12:25.202
They got some balls,
some balls.

01:12:26.475 --> 01:12:28.568
I take the dive.
What more do they want?

01:12:29.144 --> 01:12:30.668
They want me
to go down, too?

01:12:30.812 --> 01:12:33.280
I ain't goin' down.
I ain't goin' down for nobody.

01:12:33.382 --> 01:12:35.976
Why don't you do me a favor?
Just put your hands up.

01:12:36.118 --> 01:12:38.382
I wanna show you somethin'.
Put your hands up.

01:12:39.655 --> 01:12:43.421
- What the fuck is so hard about that?
- Hey, you don't understand.

01:12:44.559 --> 01:12:47.084
I had to fight a bum.
He's a bum.

01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:50.096
I fought the guy, I tapped him like that,
all of a sudden he's like this

01:12:50.232 --> 01:12:51.824
all over the place,
what am I gonna do?

01:12:51.967 --> 01:12:54.026
You don't have to fuckin'
pick him up and help him.

01:12:54.169 --> 01:12:55.830
What am I gonna do?
If I don't pick him up,

01:12:55.971 --> 01:12:58.166
then what am I gonna do?
I'm gonna be in worse trouble.

01:12:59.007 --> 01:13:00.497
I don't know.

01:13:00.642 --> 01:13:03.634
"Purse was withheld..." look at this...
"Purse was withheld pending

01:13:03.779 --> 01:13:05.804
D.A.'s probe."
Look at that.

01:13:05.947 --> 01:13:08.507
Look how they make me look.

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:10.641
Like a bum,
like a mammalucco.

01:13:11.353 --> 01:13:12.285
A what?

01:13:12.421 --> 01:13:14.651
Like the mammalucco of the year.

01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:16.382
Tommy ain't gonna forget us.

01:13:17.259 --> 01:13:19.784
You're gonna get your shot,
as long as he don't die.

01:13:21.029 --> 01:13:22.997
- As long as who don't die?
- Tommy.

01:13:23.131 --> 01:13:24.655
What are you talkin' about?

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.665
In other words,
Tommy ain't gonna forget ya,

01:13:26.802 --> 01:13:27.996
you're gonna get your shot
if he don't die.

01:13:28.136 --> 01:13:30.161
- Gotta make sure the guy stays alive.
- He got a disease or somethin'?

01:13:30.305 --> 01:13:32.170
No, I'm just sayin',
I'm kiddin', like.

01:13:32.307 --> 01:13:34.036
What's wrong with him?
Is somethin' wrong with him?

01:13:34.176 --> 01:13:36.076
There ain't nothin' wrong with him,
that's the only way you wouldn't get it

01:13:36.211 --> 01:13:39.078
- is if he dies, he won't be able to...
- What are you talkin' like that for?

01:13:47.889 --> 01:13:49.356
What do you want me to do?
It's an outdoor arena.

01:13:49.491 --> 01:13:52.255
What do you wanna do,
fight in the rain? It's a stadium.

01:13:52.394 --> 01:13:53.952
You waited this long,
you can wait longer.

01:13:54.663 --> 01:13:57.131
You wanna wait 24 hours?
I don't wanna wait no 24 hours.

01:13:57.232 --> 01:14:00.258
I don't either, but we gotta,
so we'll wait. Hello?

01:14:01.002 --> 01:14:04.028
- You guys wanna stop now?
- Get off the phone with them.

01:14:04.172 --> 01:14:05.696
Why do you give them
the satisfaction?

01:14:05.841 --> 01:14:08.105
- Get off the phone with them!
- He don't wanna talk to nobody.

01:14:08.243 --> 01:14:10.370
How many times do we have
to tell ya? You hear him yellin'?

01:14:10.512 --> 01:14:13.037
There's enough confusion up here.
Please, don't call.

01:14:13.181 --> 01:14:16.446
No comment. Right.
Thank you. Bye!

01:14:16.585 --> 01:14:18.553
Pains in the asses,
I don't believe them.

01:14:18.687 --> 01:14:21.281
Why do you give them the satisfaction?
Why don't you just hang up on 'em?

01:14:21.423 --> 01:14:23.288
- That's all.
- I'm gonna get somethin' to eat.

01:14:23.425 --> 01:14:25.518
- What do you want to eat?
- I don't want nothin'.

01:14:26.094 --> 01:14:27.186
I don't want nothin'.

01:14:27.329 --> 01:14:29.263
Eat somethin',
you gotta eat somethin'.

01:14:31.466 --> 01:14:33.934
You can't go without eatin'.
Eat a steak.

01:14:34.035 --> 01:14:36.902
You chew it, you spit it out,
you'll still make the weight tomorrow.

01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:39.038
You're worried about that?

01:14:41.309 --> 01:14:43.573
I'll order a steak.
At least if you want it, it's here.

01:14:43.712 --> 01:14:45.577
You don't want it,
do whatever you want with it.

01:14:45.714 --> 01:14:48.114
- Go ahead.
- Vickie, what do you want?

01:14:48.884 --> 01:14:50.681
Order me a piece of cake.

01:14:50.819 --> 01:14:52.684
That's all you want
is a piece of cake?

01:14:52.821 --> 01:14:56.416
Why don't you get a cheeseburger,
French fries? It's better for you.

01:14:56.558 --> 01:14:58.526
- It's like a whole meal.
- Yeah, that's good.

01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:00.127
That's good,
order me one of those.

01:15:00.228 --> 01:15:02.128
Wait a minute,
what do you want to eat?

01:15:02.264 --> 01:15:04.459
Since when did you
order one of those?

01:15:05.267 --> 01:15:06.962
- That's what I want.
- It's a free country.

01:15:07.102 --> 01:15:09.195
You order what you want.
Don't let nobody influence you.

01:15:09.337 --> 01:15:11.430
I'm not tellin' her what to eat,
I was just suggesting.

01:15:11.573 --> 01:15:13.473
What are you tellin' her
what to ask for?

01:15:13.608 --> 01:15:16.702
I'm not tellin' her... personally,
I don't give a fuck what she eats.

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:19.439
What were you tellin' her that for?

01:15:19.581 --> 01:15:21.446
Order me a cheeseburger.

01:15:24.452 --> 01:15:27.012
Just order her
a cheeseburger, that's all.

01:15:28.256 --> 01:15:29.450
What the f?

01:15:29.591 --> 01:15:32.651
What are you guys doin' so long?
How long does this thing take to do?

01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:33.726
Forty seconds.

01:15:33.862 --> 01:15:36.387
Forty seconds is no good.
You gotta do it in 30 seconds.

01:15:36.531 --> 01:15:38.624
If we gotta stitch him up,
that's how much time.

01:15:43.138 --> 01:15:44.230
Ya up?

01:15:44.806 --> 01:15:47.274
- What?

01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:49.741
- Hey, Jack.

01:15:49.878 --> 01:15:51.140

Say hello to Charlie. Charlie!

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:01.314
- Jake, how are ya? Lots of luck.
- Hello, Charlie, good to see you.

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:03.152
Thank you.

01:16:04.326 --> 01:16:07.227
- How you feeling?
- I'm feelin' all right, thank you.

01:16:07.362 --> 01:16:10.422
- Are you feeling good?
- I feel as good as I'm gonna feel.

01:16:10.565 --> 01:16:13.033
I gotta get in there and fight,
then I'll know how I'm gonna feel.

01:16:13.134 --> 01:16:16.194
All right. We just come by
to wish you luck and all that.

01:16:16.338 --> 01:16:17.805
- Thanks.

01:16:17.906 --> 01:16:19.237
- No.
- You sure, nothing?

01:16:19.374 --> 01:16:20.306
No, thank you, Tommy.

01:16:20.442 --> 01:16:22.467
All right.
Take care, good luck.

01:16:22.611 --> 01:16:24.272
- God bless ya.
- All right, thank you.

01:16:24.412 --> 01:16:26.676
- You'll be all right.
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

01:16:27.515 --> 01:16:28.743
See you later, everybody.

01:16:28.884 --> 01:16:30.715
- Vickie, good-bye.
- Tommy, wait.

01:16:30.852 --> 01:16:33.320
We really appreciate your comin',
I want you to know that.

01:16:33.421 --> 01:16:35.548
It was really nice of you.
I appreciate it.

01:16:35.690 --> 01:16:38.523
- Come on, Joey, anytime.
- A time like this is very important to him.

01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:40.924
- Anytime.
- I just wanted to say good-bye.

01:16:41.062 --> 01:16:43.860
So long, honey. I want you
to take good care of that guy, all right?

01:16:43.999 --> 01:16:46.229
- I'll take care of him.
- Joey, any little thing,

01:16:46.368 --> 01:16:49.064
I want you to call me.
He's very nervous. Ba-boom, call.

01:16:49.204 --> 01:16:50.171
Good-bye, honey.

01:16:51.473 --> 01:16:53.805
Would you look at that face?
What a face.

01:16:53.942 --> 01:16:55.569
Can you believe that girl?

01:16:55.710 --> 01:16:58.008
Look at that beauty.
Just as beautiful as ever.

01:16:58.146 --> 01:17:00.307
- The least little thing, all right?
- Bye-bye, Tommy.

01:17:00.448 --> 01:17:03.884
- So long, everybody.
- So long, Tommy.

01:17:13.495 --> 01:17:15.258
Hey! Come here.

01:17:16.064 --> 01:17:17.326
Come here a minute.

01:17:24.773 --> 01:17:26.365
What was all that about?

01:17:27.108 --> 01:17:28.097
All what?

01:17:28.243 --> 01:17:29.972
You know what I'm talkin' about.
What was that all about?

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:34.715
- With him.
- Nothin', I just said good-bye.

01:17:34.849 --> 01:17:36.908
All of a sudden you're
so friendly with him?

01:17:37.052 --> 01:17:38.713
- I just said good-bye.
- You don't do that.

01:17:38.853 --> 01:17:41.185
You say hello, you say good-bye,
that's all, ya hear?

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:42.790
- I hear.
- Hey!

01:17:43.391 --> 01:17:45.985
You hear what I said? You don't ever
have any disrespect for me.

01:17:46.127 --> 01:17:47.719
You hear what I said?

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:52.095
- Yeah, I hear.
- All right. Go in there.

01:17:53.034 --> 01:17:54.968

01:17:55.103 --> 01:17:56.695

01:17:59.374 --> 01:18:00.466

01:18:08.917 --> 01:18:11.385
Disgusted with the two of youse.

All right, let's go.

01:19:03.505 --> 01:19:05.097
Good luck, Jake!

01:19:44.813 --> 01:19:49.512
For the Middleweight Championship
of the World, 15 rounds.

01:19:49.651 --> 01:19:53.178

Kill him!

01:20:38.733 --> 01:20:40.257

01:20:55.984 --> 01:20:57.076
Come on, Jake!

01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:01.220
Blow on him, he'll fuckin' fall

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:03.984
Look at him.
Do you feel all right?

01:21:06.828 --> 01:21:08.625
- No way, huh?
- Can't continue?

01:21:09.330 --> 01:21:12.094
Hey, Commissioner? Come on in,
I'm gonna stop the fight.

01:21:12.233 --> 01:21:13.700
Yeah, you did it, Jake!

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:28.874
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

01:21:29.117 --> 01:21:33.486
Cerdan, unable to continue,
the referee stops the fight.

01:21:33.621 --> 01:21:35.816

01:21:37.458 --> 01:21:40.188
and the new
Middleweight Champion of the World,

01:21:40.461 --> 01:21:44.056
the Bronx Bull,
Jake La Motta!

01:21:47.702 --> 01:21:50.637
Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

01:22:08.122 --> 01:22:11.250
Don't shake that.
Don't shake it like that, I'm tellin' ya.

01:22:11.392 --> 01:22:13.053
It's the worst thing you could do.

01:22:18.499 --> 01:22:19.761
Oh, you're home.

01:22:20.835 --> 01:22:23.201
- Hi, Vick.
- Hi, Joe.

01:22:26.007 --> 01:22:28.373
- Hello.
- Hi. Where were ya?

01:22:28.509 --> 01:22:31.376
I went out.
What's the matter?

01:22:31.512 --> 01:22:32.979
Television won't work.

01:22:33.848 --> 01:22:35.315
Where'd you go?

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:39.716
Went out, went shoppin'.
Went to my sister's. You know.

01:22:51.132 --> 01:22:54.624
What's the matter with you?
What's with this kissin' on the mouth?

01:22:54.769 --> 01:22:56.794
I just said hello.
Can't I kiss my sister-in-law?

01:22:56.938 --> 01:22:58.428
Isn't the cheek
good enough for you?

01:22:58.573 --> 01:22:59.505
Come on, huh?

01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:01.165
I don't even kiss Mom on the mouth
the way you kiss her.

01:23:01.309 --> 01:23:02.867
All of a sudden,
you're like a Romeo.

01:23:03.011 --> 01:23:04.911
You're not supposed to kiss
your mother on the mouth.

01:23:05.046 --> 01:23:06.638
That's what I'm talkin' about.

01:23:11.552 --> 01:23:13.884
- How's that?
- That looks like somethin'.

01:23:17.992 --> 01:23:21.018
Get back, I can't see nothin'
with your stomach in the way.

01:23:22.263 --> 01:23:24.231
What are you
givin' me dirty looks for?

01:23:27.101 --> 01:23:29.865
Supposed to be a champion,
ya eat like there's no tomorrow.

01:23:30.004 --> 01:23:31.767
That's it, go ahead...
forget how long it took you

01:23:31.906 --> 01:23:33.965
to get to the title,
all the years, the hard work.

01:23:34.108 --> 01:23:36.804
You forgot. You're gonna
defend it next month, keep eatin'.

01:23:37.612 --> 01:23:40.206
Give me dirty looks like
I don't know what I'm talkin' about?

01:23:43.785 --> 01:23:46.379
What happened with you
and Salvy at the Copa that time?

01:23:46.521 --> 01:23:49.490
- When?
- When you gave him a beatin'.

01:23:50.291 --> 01:23:52.418
You mean when I caught
his head in the taxicab door,

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:54.755
and was bangin' it,
smacked him with a glass?

01:23:54.896 --> 01:23:56.796
- Yeah.
- I told you about that.

01:23:57.465 --> 01:23:58.932
- Didn't I?
- No.

01:23:59.033 --> 01:24:01.399
- I never told you?
- No, you never told me.

01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:02.833
It was no big thing, anyway.

01:24:02.970 --> 01:24:05.734
I smacked him in the mouth,
he was drunk, he started some shit.

01:24:05.873 --> 01:24:08.034
Had to go downtown,
straighten it all out with Tommy.

01:24:08.176 --> 01:24:10.144
It's all forgotten about,
supposedly, anyway.

01:24:10.278 --> 01:24:12.337
How come you
never told me about it?

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:14.675
It didn't have anything
to do with you.

01:24:16.317 --> 01:24:18.148
- Had nothin' to do with me?
- No.

01:24:18.286 --> 01:24:21.983
Who'd it have somethin'
to do with... Vickie?

01:24:22.657 --> 01:24:25.524
I just explained
the whole thing to you, didn't I?

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:27.628
- Yeah.
- It was between me and Salvy.

01:24:27.762 --> 01:24:31.129
If it had anything to do with you
and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.

01:24:34.435 --> 01:24:36.027
That's not what I heard, Joe.

01:24:36.170 --> 01:24:37.637
What do you mean,
that's not what you heard?

01:24:37.772 --> 01:24:39.706
- That's not what I heard.
- What'd you hear?

01:24:39.841 --> 01:24:41.365
I heard some things.

01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:44.670
- You heard about me and Salvy...
- I heard things, Joey.

01:24:44.812 --> 01:24:47.303
You heard that I cracked Salvy
all around, what'd you hear?

01:24:47.448 --> 01:24:49.313
- I heard things.
- What things you heard?

01:24:49.450 --> 01:24:50.508
I heard some things.

01:24:50.651 --> 01:24:53.119
You heard things. You wanna worry?
Don't start that shit.

01:24:53.254 --> 01:24:54.653
You know what
you should worry about?

01:24:54.789 --> 01:24:57.815
Worry you got this title fight next month.
That's what you should worry about.

01:24:58.760 --> 01:24:59.852
Do that.

01:25:03.664 --> 01:25:04.756
Christ!

01:25:09.670 --> 01:25:12.036
- Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
- What?

01:25:12.173 --> 01:25:13.731
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?

01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:18.110
Hey, Jack,
don't start your shit.

01:25:18.246 --> 01:25:20.180
- No, really, don't start.
- Joey, I asked ya.

01:25:20.314 --> 01:25:23.340
- Didn't I ask ya to keep an eye on her?
- And I did keep an eye on her.

01:25:23.484 --> 01:25:24.883
Then how come ya
gave him a beatin'?

01:25:25.019 --> 01:25:27.283
I told you that.
I told you what that was all about.

01:25:27.422 --> 01:25:29.014
Didn't have nothin' to do with you.

01:25:29.157 --> 01:25:32.058
- He thinks he's a wiseguy...
- Joey, don't lie to me.

01:25:32.193 --> 01:25:34.184
- I'm not lyin'.
- What do I look like to you?

01:25:34.328 --> 01:25:35.852
Hey, I'm your brother.

01:25:35.997 --> 01:25:38.022
You're supposed to believe me.
Don't you trust me?

01:25:38.166 --> 01:25:39.633
- No, I don't.
- You don't? That's nice.

01:25:39.767 --> 01:25:42.668
I don't trust you when it comes to her.
I don't trust nobody.

01:25:43.704 --> 01:25:47.868
- Tell me what happened.
- I told you exactly what happened.

01:25:48.009 --> 01:25:50.409
He got out of line,
I slapped him around.

01:25:50.545 --> 01:25:53.275
Tommy straightened it all out,
and it's all over.

01:25:59.287 --> 01:26:01.084
You give me
that look, Joey.

01:26:03.991 --> 01:26:06.755
I gotta accept
your answer, you know?

01:26:06.894 --> 01:26:08.828
But I'm tellin' ya now,
if I hear anything,

01:26:08.963 --> 01:26:11.591
I swear on our mother,
I'm gonna kill somebody.

01:26:12.633 --> 01:26:15.966
- I'm gonna kill somebody.
- Well, go ahead and kill everybody!

01:26:16.103 --> 01:26:17.502
You're the tough guy,
go kill people.

01:26:17.638 --> 01:26:19.902
Kill Vickie, kill Salvy,
kill Tommy Como,

01:26:20.041 --> 01:26:21.872
kill me, while you're at it,
what do I care?

01:26:22.009 --> 01:26:24.807
You're killin' yourself,
the way you eat, ya fat fuck!

01:26:24.946 --> 01:26:26.811
- Look at ya!
- What do you mean?

01:26:26.948 --> 01:26:28.813
I don't understand,
what do you mean, kill you?

01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:33.011
Me, kill me! Start here!
Kill me first, do me a fuckin' favor!

01:26:33.154 --> 01:26:35.145
'Cause you're drivin' me crazy!

01:26:35.289 --> 01:26:38.190
You're a killer, you're a big shot.
Just kill, you're a killer.

01:26:38.326 --> 01:26:40.521
Excuse me,
what do you mean by you, though?

01:26:40.661 --> 01:26:43.459
So? What does that mean?
Don't mean nothin'.

01:26:43.598 --> 01:26:45.998
Even you don't know
what you meant by you.

01:26:46.133 --> 01:26:48.624
- Don't mean nothin'.
- Joey, that meant somethin'.

01:26:48.769 --> 01:26:51.135
You mentioned Tommy, Salvy,
you mentioned you...

01:26:51.272 --> 01:26:52.671
you included you with them.

01:26:53.241 --> 01:26:56.210
You coulda said anybody,
but you said you and them.

01:26:57.278 --> 01:26:59.746
You really let this girl
ruin your life, look at ya.

01:26:59.847 --> 01:27:02.714
She really did some job on ya,
ya know how fuckin' nuts you are?

01:27:02.850 --> 01:27:05.341
- Look what she did to you!
- You fuck my wife?

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:07.420
- What?!
- You fuck my wife?

01:27:11.125 --> 01:27:12.854
How could you ask me
a question like that?

01:27:12.994 --> 01:27:14.859
How could you ask me?
I'm your brother.

01:27:14.996 --> 01:27:16.930
You ask me that?

01:27:17.832 --> 01:27:20.596
Where do you get your balls
big enough to ask me that?

01:27:24.405 --> 01:27:25.667
Just tell me.

01:27:30.645 --> 01:27:32.374
I'm not answerin' that.

01:27:32.513 --> 01:27:34.640
I'm not gonna answer that,
it's stupid.

01:27:38.753 --> 01:27:40.448
You're very smart, Joey.

01:27:42.757 --> 01:27:46.022
You're givin' me all these answers,
but you ain't givin' me the right answer.

01:27:48.996 --> 01:27:50.486
I'm gonna ask ya again.

01:27:53.267 --> 01:27:54.996
Did you or did you not?

01:27:56.203 --> 01:27:57.602
I'm not gonna answer.

01:27:57.738 --> 01:27:59.638
That's a sick question,
you're a sick fuck,

01:27:59.774 --> 01:28:01.799
and I'm not that sick
that I'm gonna answer it.

01:28:01.943 --> 01:28:04.207
I'm not tellin' ya anything.
I'm gonna leave.

01:28:04.345 --> 01:28:07.280
If Lenore calls, tell her I went home.
I'm not stayin' in this nuthouse with ya.

01:28:07.415 --> 01:28:09.508
You're a sick bastard...
I feel sorry for ya, I really do.

01:28:09.650 --> 01:28:10.674
You know what you should do?

01:28:10.818 --> 01:28:13.378
Try a little more fuckin'
and a little less eatin'.

01:28:13.521 --> 01:28:15.648
You won't have troubles
upstairs in your bedroom,

01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:17.883
and you won't pick it out
on me and everybody else.

01:28:18.025 --> 01:28:21.085
Ya understand, ya fuckin' wacko?
You're crackin' up.

01:28:22.964 --> 01:28:24.898
Fuckin' screwball, ya.

01:29:08.442 --> 01:29:10.034
Where were ya?

01:29:10.177 --> 01:29:11.508
I was at my sister's.

01:29:11.646 --> 01:29:13.273
Where'd you go after that?

01:29:14.682 --> 01:29:17.344
- To the movies.
- Yeah, what'd you see?

01:29:19.453 --> 01:29:21.011
Father of the Bride.

01:29:26.961 --> 01:29:29.429
How come you didn't
tell me about the Copa?

01:29:31.966 --> 01:29:34.434
- Tell you what about it?
- You know.

01:29:35.136 --> 01:29:37.127
How come you didn't
tell me about it?

01:29:38.406 --> 01:29:40.499
Why didn't you tell
me about it, huh?

01:29:40.641 --> 01:29:42.575
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

01:29:44.078 --> 01:29:46.945
Why didn't you tell me?
Did you fuck my brother?

01:29:47.081 --> 01:29:49.481
- Get off me, you fat pig!
- Did you? Did you?

01:29:49.617 --> 01:29:50.879
- Huh?
- No!

01:29:57.825 --> 01:29:58.814
Open the door.

01:29:58.959 --> 01:30:00.551
- Get away!
- Come on, open the door.

01:30:00.695 --> 01:30:03.061
- I wanna talk to you.
- Get away from me, you're sick!

01:30:03.197 --> 01:30:05.722
I just wanna ask you one thing.
Why'd you fuck Joey?

01:30:05.866 --> 01:30:07.128
- Get away!
- Open the door.

01:30:07.268 --> 01:30:08.360
No.

01:30:11.772 --> 01:30:13.933
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you do it, huh?

01:30:14.408 --> 01:30:15.705
I didn't do anything!

01:30:17.945 --> 01:30:20.880
- Why did you fuck them?
- Do what? I didn't do anything?!

01:30:21.015 --> 01:30:21.982
I fucked all of 'em!

01:30:22.116 --> 01:30:24.209
- What do you want me to say?
- What do you mean, who'd you fuck?

01:30:24.351 --> 01:30:26.876
I fucked all of 'em... Tommy,
Salvy, your brother, all of 'em!

01:30:27.021 --> 01:30:29.649
I sucked your brother's cock!
What do you want me to say?!

01:30:30.791 --> 01:30:32.554
- You sucked his cock?
- I sucked his cock,

01:30:32.693 --> 01:30:34.490
and everybody else on
the fuckin' street.

01:30:34.628 --> 01:30:37.654
What do you want? You're nothin'
but a fat pig, selfish fool!

01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:40.767
Forget fuckin' with you!

01:30:45.306 --> 01:30:48.537
His fuckin' cock's
bigger than yours, too!

01:30:49.977 --> 01:30:51.604
Where you goin'?

01:30:51.746 --> 01:30:54.271
Where are you goin',
you bastard?

01:30:54.415 --> 01:30:56.246
You sick animal!
Where you goin'?

01:30:56.383 --> 01:31:00.251
Let me go! Get off of me,
ya piece of shit!

01:31:00.387 --> 01:31:02.855
If I see you put your hands
in that plate one more time,

01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:04.855
I'm gonna stab you
with this knife, ya hear me?

01:31:04.992 --> 01:31:07.586
I told ya, keep your hands
outta the plate!

01:31:08.929 --> 01:31:11.727
Why can't we eat in peace
around here? Just relax.

01:31:11.866 --> 01:31:13.766
Do I have to eat like you?
Like a gavone, like...

01:31:13.901 --> 01:31:17.098
Jack! Jack!
What's the matter with you?!

01:31:17.238 --> 01:31:18.637
Ya fucked my wife, huh?!

01:31:22.610 --> 01:31:23.770
Get off of him!

01:31:26.514 --> 01:31:30.143
- I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya!
- Stop it, he didn't do it!

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:34.315
Call the police!

01:31:36.924 --> 01:31:38.391
I'll fuckin' kill ya!

01:31:40.594 --> 01:31:41.686
Get out!

01:32:35.783 --> 01:32:37.751
Don't leave, honey, please.

01:33:10.150 --> 01:33:13.984
Honey, look... I'm a bum without
you and the kids, don't go.

01:33:32.139 --> 01:33:33.197
Just...

01:33:54.395 --> 01:33:56.920
Less than a minute to go,
and La Motta is losing the title

01:33:57.064 --> 01:33:59.259
that he won from
the gallant Marcel Cerdan.

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:02.267
After the tragic plane crash
that took Cerdan's life,

01:34:02.403 --> 01:34:05.270
Laurent Dauthuille vowed
to bring the title back to France.

01:34:05.406 --> 01:34:08.273
Tonight, he only has to last
this fifteenth round

01:34:08.409 --> 01:34:11.003
to be crowned the new
Middleweight Champion.

01:34:11.745 --> 01:34:15.146
La Motta is taking terrible punishment
on the ropes as Dauthuille bangs him

01:34:15.282 --> 01:34:18.649
with lefts and rights to the head.
Another left, another right to the jaw.

01:34:18.786 --> 01:34:21.254
La Motta turns around,
he's been playing possum!

01:34:21.388 --> 01:34:24.016
He's got Dauthuille hurt!
He rips a right hand to the body,

01:34:24.158 --> 01:34:26.888
two left hooks to the jaw,
another left and a right to the head!

01:34:27.027 --> 01:34:29.291
Dauthuille is reeling around the ring!

01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:31.660
The tide has turned,
no question about it!

01:34:35.369 --> 01:34:38.532
And he wobbles into the ropes
and goes down!

01:34:39.106 --> 01:34:41.870
Dauthuille is down,
and referee Lou Handler comes over

01:34:42.009 --> 01:34:45.035
and starts the count.
He's trying to get up.

01:34:45.179 --> 01:34:46.840
Six... seven...

01:34:46.981 --> 01:34:50.439
He'll never make it.
Nine... ten!

01:34:50.584 --> 01:34:51.573
You're out!

01:34:51.719 --> 01:34:53.016
It is all over!

01:34:53.153 --> 01:34:55.246
He is knocked out,
and Jake La Motta,

01:34:55.389 --> 01:34:58.051
with 13 seconds left to go
in the final round,

01:34:58.192 --> 01:35:00.660
has made one of the most
remarkable comebacks

01:35:00.761 --> 01:35:03.389
- in all boxing history.
- Jake La Motta!

01:35:08.635 --> 01:35:09.727
Come on.

01:35:10.471 --> 01:35:12.735
Just tell him you're sorry,
you miss him.

01:35:17.811 --> 01:35:20.905
He's your brother, you have to
talk to him sooner or later.

01:35:28.422 --> 01:35:30.788
I'll dial him for you,
then you talk to him.

01:35:30.924 --> 01:35:33.757
Just tell him you're sorry,
then you can say whatever you want.

01:35:47.107 --> 01:35:48.199
Go ahead.

01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:01.554
Hey, champ... like to ask
you a few questions.

01:36:01.688 --> 01:36:04.054
- Not now.
- I been waitin' an hour for you.

01:36:04.191 --> 01:36:06.785
- Excuse me, my wife is...
- There's a great angle here...

01:36:06.927 --> 01:36:09.555
Don't bother me, please.
Get outta here.

01:36:09.696 --> 01:36:10.890
Come on. All right, champ?

01:36:11.031 --> 01:36:13.727
- You're a great guy.
- I asked you nice, will ya?

01:36:24.745 --> 01:36:25.837
Hello?

01:36:32.586 --> 01:36:35.350
Salvy, this ain't
funny anymore.

01:36:35.489 --> 01:36:36.513
Is that you?

01:36:36.657 --> 01:36:39.524
I know somebody's there,
I can hear you breathin'.

01:36:40.094 --> 01:36:41.356
You listenin'?

01:36:41.528 --> 01:36:46.261
Your mother sucks
fuckin' big fuckin' elephant dicks.

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:47.867
You got that?

01:37:36.483 --> 01:37:38.007
The fight of the year.

01:37:38.152 --> 01:37:41.383
The next time that friendly bartender
says, "What'll you have?"

01:37:41.522 --> 01:37:44.457
Give him that answer the whole world
gives, "Pabst Blue Ribbon."

01:37:47.928 --> 01:37:50.795
Those punches by La Motta
explain themselves.

01:37:50.931 --> 01:37:54.128
They fought five times
between 1942 and 1945.

01:37:54.268 --> 01:37:59.069
It has so far been a blazing bout
for the Middleweight Championship.

01:37:59.773 --> 01:38:03.106
In that great action by La Motta,
he couldn't score the big one.

01:38:03.243 --> 01:38:05.336
That's it,
that was his last shot.

01:38:07.614 --> 01:38:10.447
Round number 13,
the hard-luck number.

01:38:10.584 --> 01:38:12.142
There's the buzzer,

01:38:12.286 --> 01:38:14.254
and I think you know
both the boys.

01:38:24.798 --> 01:38:27.426
Robinson hurting La Motta,
he's hurting him now.

01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:33.439
He has La Motta
on queer street, holding on.

01:38:34.141 --> 01:38:36.803
Certainly, that was one
of the most damaging evidences

01:38:36.944 --> 01:38:39.742
of punching that
you have seen in recent years.

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:41.575
Come on! Come on.

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:50.515
- What are you standin' there for?
- Robinson, apparently tired,

01:38:50.657 --> 01:38:53.524
punched with a "fare thee well,"
and rocked Jake La Motta

01:38:53.660 --> 01:38:55.287
- right to his heels.
- Come on, Ray, come on!

01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:04.060
These are clean, whistling shots.

01:40:04.197 --> 01:40:06.859
How he can survive them,
nobody knows.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.195
No man can endure this pummeling!

01:40:09.336 --> 01:40:12.066
The fight is stopped on...

01:40:12.205 --> 01:40:14.901
the signal to Frankie Sikora.

01:40:15.075 --> 01:40:17.976
Row after row after row
from the ring,

01:40:18.111 --> 01:40:19.601
the crowd is standing and cheering,

01:40:19.746 --> 01:40:22.738
as he just cannonaded
Jake La Motta

01:40:22.883 --> 01:40:25.875
- into a death defeat.
- Hey, Ray.

01:40:26.019 --> 01:40:29.079
And when I say that, I mean
Jake wouldn't want to quit.

01:40:29.222 --> 01:40:31.315
- He wanted to go.
- Hey, Ray.

01:40:32.959 --> 01:40:34.449
Never went down, Ray.

01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:37.563
You never got me down, Ray.

01:40:38.465 --> 01:40:39.557
Ya hear me?

01:40:40.267 --> 01:40:42.258
Never got me down.

01:40:42.402 --> 01:40:44.802
Yeah? See, look?

01:40:44.938 --> 01:40:47.600
And in the thirteenth round,
the hard-luck round,

01:40:47.741 --> 01:40:50.574
the championship of the world
has changed hands.

01:40:51.478 --> 01:40:52.467
And there you see it...

01:40:53.313 --> 01:40:55.781
a champion gone down to defeat.

01:40:56.583 --> 01:40:58.881
And so, now we wait
for the announcement

01:40:59.019 --> 01:41:02.921
from Eddie Flint,
the ring announcer.

01:41:03.657 --> 01:41:06.057
Then we'll get up in the ring,
join with the radio audience

01:41:06.193 --> 01:41:07.592
throughout the world,

01:41:07.728 --> 01:41:10.253
and have a brief interview
with Ray Robinson.

01:41:10.997 --> 01:41:13.966
Now we're waiting for the time
to be announced.

01:41:14.101 --> 01:41:17.036
And it is being handed between
the commissioner and Eddie Flint.

01:41:17.170 --> 01:41:19.468
The fight was stopped
on a signal from Joe Tryner...

01:41:19.606 --> 01:41:21.540
Attention, ladies and gentlemen!

01:41:21.675 --> 01:41:25.475
The winner by a technical knockout
in two minutes and four seconds

01:41:25.612 --> 01:41:27.477
of the thirteenth round,

01:41:27.614 --> 01:41:30.481
and the new World's Middleweight
Boxing Champion,

01:41:30.617 --> 01:41:31.982
Sugar Ray Robinson!

01:41:40.193 --> 01:41:41.524
Why are you pulling out
of Wednesday's fight?

01:41:42.195 --> 01:41:44.390
It's over for me...
boxing's over for me.

01:41:45.198 --> 01:41:46.256
I'm through.

01:41:47.634 --> 01:41:49.226
I'm tired of worryin' about weight.

01:41:49.369 --> 01:41:52.395
That's all I used to think about
was weight, weight, weight.

01:41:52.539 --> 01:41:54.939
After a while, you realize
there are other things in life.

01:41:55.075 --> 01:41:57.441
I'm very grateful.
Boxing's been good to me.

01:41:57.577 --> 01:41:59.943
I got a nice house,
I got three great kids.

01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:03.907
I got a wonderful, beautiful wife.
What more could I ask for?

01:42:05.652 --> 01:42:08.120
- Hey, what's your name?
- Bob.

01:42:08.255 --> 01:42:09.415
Take a picture, Bob.

01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:12.185
Let him take a picture
of ya, honey... for us.

01:42:12.325 --> 01:42:13.917
Go ahead, smile.

01:42:16.196 --> 01:42:17.356
Thank you, Bob.

01:42:17.497 --> 01:42:20.261
Take a picture of all of us.
Jackie, come here, sit over here.

01:42:24.571 --> 01:42:26.835
All right, everybody, smile. Smile.

01:42:29.576 --> 01:42:31.908
Mrs. La Motta, how do you feel
about Jake's retirement?

01:42:32.045 --> 01:42:33.239
I think it's great.

01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:35.678
He picked the right time
to stop fightin'.

01:42:35.816 --> 01:42:37.579
He's home with us
all the time now.

01:42:37.751 --> 01:42:39.810
- It's really good.
- You know what? You through?

01:42:39.953 --> 01:42:42.478
- Excuse me, you through?
- Yeah.

01:42:42.622 --> 01:42:44.749
I just bought a club
on Collins Avenue.

01:42:44.891 --> 01:42:48.088
It's a bar, package store, everything.
Guess what I'm gonna call it?

01:42:48.228 --> 01:42:49.160
I don't know.

01:42:49.296 --> 01:42:51.059
- What are you gonna call it?
- Take a guess.

01:43:03.810 --> 01:43:05.573
All right, shut up.
Enough, enough.

01:43:07.647 --> 01:43:08.614
Thank you.

01:43:14.387 --> 01:43:16.981
Just wanted to see
what the microphone

01:43:17.123 --> 01:43:19.455
on a sexy girl sounds like.

01:43:26.933 --> 01:43:28.195
See how that sounds.

01:43:29.302 --> 01:43:30.769
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:43:30.871 --> 01:43:32.998
I haven't seen so many losers
since my last fight

01:43:33.139 --> 01:43:34.606
at Madison Square Garden.

01:43:37.277 --> 01:43:38.744
Okay, honey.

01:43:39.946 --> 01:43:41.413
Thank you, doll.

01:43:42.282 --> 01:43:44.375
- Isn't that somethin'?
- Bring us another drink.

01:43:44.518 --> 01:43:46.110
- Salute.
- Salute.

01:43:49.122 --> 01:43:50.453
Look at this terrific girl.

01:43:50.590 --> 01:43:52.888
She's the kinda girl you
wanna bring home to your father,

01:43:53.026 --> 01:43:55.290
especially if he's a degenerate.

01:43:56.630 --> 01:43:57.722
Did I say that?

01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:03.126
Nah, seriously, folks,
it's a thrill to be standing here

01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:05.966
before all you
wonderful people tonight.

01:44:06.106 --> 01:44:08.370
In fact, it's a thrill
to be standing.

01:44:10.977 --> 01:44:13.969
If you believe it's a thrill to be standin'
before you wonderful people, then...

01:44:14.114 --> 01:44:15.274
you're all full of shit.

01:44:18.818 --> 01:44:21.150
By the way, me and my wife
Vickie's gettin' married.

01:44:21.288 --> 01:44:23.483
What am I talkin' about?
I'm out of it.

01:44:25.759 --> 01:44:28.159
Is she here?
She's not here.

01:44:28.295 --> 01:44:30.092
Vickie?
Nah, she's not here.

01:44:30.230 --> 01:44:32.858
By the way, me and my wife
Vickie's gonna celebrate...

01:44:32.999 --> 01:44:35.467
it's a little different...
our 11th wedding anniversary.

01:44:36.169 --> 01:44:37.761
Thank you.

01:44:39.439 --> 01:44:41.100
That reminds me about
two friends of mine.

01:44:41.241 --> 01:44:43.106
One was married,
one was single.

01:44:43.243 --> 01:44:45.609
The married guy
tells the single guy,

01:44:45.745 --> 01:44:47.440
"What's the matter with you?

01:44:47.647 --> 01:44:49.706
"What's the matter with you?
Look at me, and look at you.

01:44:49.849 --> 01:44:52.613
And look at me,
and look at you."

01:44:55.622 --> 01:44:57.089
Let me get on with it.

01:44:57.724 --> 01:44:59.749
"When I come home at night,
my wife's at the door

01:44:59.893 --> 01:45:01.292
"with a tall drink in her hand.

01:45:01.428 --> 01:45:03.521
"Then she gives me
a nice hot bath,

01:45:03.663 --> 01:45:05.631
"then she gives me
a nice rubdown,

01:45:05.765 --> 01:45:07.630
"then she makes
passionate love to me,

01:45:07.767 --> 01:45:09.462
"and then she makes me
a nice dinner.

01:45:09.603 --> 01:45:12.128
What more could you ask for?
You oughta try that."

01:45:12.272 --> 01:45:14.763
The other friend says,
"Hey, that sounds great.

01:45:14.908 --> 01:45:16.375
What time does
your wife get home?"

01:45:21.481 --> 01:45:24.678
I know I'm no Olivier,
but if he fought Sugar Ray,

01:45:24.818 --> 01:45:26.342
he would say

01:45:26.486 --> 01:45:29.580
that the thing ain't the ring,

01:45:29.723 --> 01:45:31.588
it's the play.

01:45:32.425 --> 01:45:34.188
So give me a stage

01:45:34.327 --> 01:45:36.591
where this bull here can rage,

01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:38.595
and though I can fight,

01:45:38.732 --> 01:45:41.098
I'd much rather
hear myself recite.

01:45:43.103 --> 01:45:48.700
That's entertainment!

01:46:12.766 --> 01:46:14.529
Jake, how have you been?

01:46:16.636 --> 01:46:19.662
Hey!
You were just great.

01:46:19.839 --> 01:46:22.330
It's a good thing Sugar Ray
wasn't here tonight, huh?

01:46:22.475 --> 01:46:25.444
- He told that joke last week.
- Come on!

01:46:25.578 --> 01:46:28.046
He repeats himself,
gettin' a little senile.

01:46:28.848 --> 01:46:31.112
I'd like you to meet
State's Attorney Bronson.

01:46:31.251 --> 01:46:33.344
- How are ya? Nice to meet you.
- And his wife.

01:46:33.486 --> 01:46:34.885
- Nice to meet you.
- You shouldn't be here this week.

01:46:35.021 --> 01:46:38.388
It's next week we got
the shakedown payments, right?

01:46:39.726 --> 01:46:41.990
It's good seein' you.

01:46:42.162 --> 01:46:43.356
That is a joke, right?

01:46:43.496 --> 01:46:45.691
It's a joke...
only you know if it's a joke.

01:46:45.832 --> 01:46:47.424
He's just kidding, right?

01:46:48.001 --> 01:46:49.400
All right,
we'll talk about it later.

01:46:50.170 --> 01:46:52.263
- This is your wife?
- Yes, Mrs. Bronson.

01:46:52.405 --> 01:46:54.168
Very pretty lady.
Charmed to meet you.

01:46:54.307 --> 01:46:56.138
- Thank you.
- He's really a nice guy.

01:46:56.276 --> 01:46:58.540
You can take a joke,
can't you, doll?

01:47:00.714 --> 01:47:02.341
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

01:47:04.217 --> 01:47:07.209
Hey, Carlo? Carlo!

01:47:08.121 --> 01:47:10.885
Give 'em another drink.
Somethin' happened over here.

01:47:11.958 --> 01:47:14.483
- Darling, Linda, come here.
- Where's your wife?

01:47:14.627 --> 01:47:15.889
- My wife?
- Yeah, why isn't she here?

01:47:16.029 --> 01:47:17.553
What's it to you? You think
I'm gonna bring her around here,

01:47:17.697 --> 01:47:20.689
- let you bums get involved with her?
- Come on!

01:47:20.834 --> 01:47:23.029
Especially the State's Attorney
over here?

01:47:23.169 --> 01:47:25.433
He comes here a lot,
darling, watch him.

01:47:25.572 --> 01:47:27.096
He knows I'm only kiddin'.

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:29.174
- Thank you.
- Keep an eye on him.

01:47:29.642 --> 01:47:30.836
What's the problem?

01:47:30.977 --> 01:47:31.966
There's really not a problem.

01:47:32.112 --> 01:47:34.945
She doesn't look 21,
so I just had to ask for some I.D.

01:47:35.515 --> 01:47:37.107
- How old are you, honey?
- Twenty-one.

01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:38.512
- Twenty-one?
- Mm-hmm.

01:47:39.085 --> 01:47:40.882
Can you prove
that you're 21?

01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:42.954
- Mm-hmm.
- Prove it to me.

01:47:48.595 --> 01:47:51.962
Any girl that can kiss like that
can drink at my joint anytime.

01:47:52.098 --> 01:47:53.360
What about you?
How old are you?

01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:55.866
- Twenty-one.
- Can you prove that you're 21?

01:47:56.002 --> 01:47:57.936
- Yes.
- Would you prove it to me?

01:47:58.071 --> 01:47:59.333
Come here.

01:48:11.451 --> 01:48:12.543
She's 21, too?

01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:16.555
She has convinced me
that she's 21, too.

01:48:32.739 --> 01:48:35.037
- Watch it while I'm pouring.
- Your wife's outside.

01:48:35.175 --> 01:48:37.643
- She's waitin' for you.
- Why don't ya tell me a little louder?

01:48:51.491 --> 01:48:52.753
There.

01:48:58.264 --> 01:48:59.356
Come on, Jake.

01:49:05.772 --> 01:49:07.672
<i>♫ Lonely nights</i>

01:49:08.875 --> 01:49:11.673
<i>♫ I'm so lonely</i>

01:49:12.245 --> 01:49:14.509
<i>♫ Please come home</i>

01:49:14.647 --> 01:49:18.913
<i>♫ You great big
lump of sugar</i>

01:49:19.485 --> 01:49:21.612
<i>♫ I miss you so much</i>

01:49:21.754 --> 01:49:23.551
<i>♫ Please come home</i>

01:49:23.690 --> 01:49:26.625
<i>♫ Lonely nights</i>

01:49:41.307 --> 01:49:43.775
It was a busy night last night.

01:49:44.978 --> 01:49:47.572
- Everything all right?
- I'm leaving you, Jake.

01:49:48.648 --> 01:49:51.116
- What else is new?
- No. I mean it this time.

01:49:51.251 --> 01:49:53.515
I didn't wanna tell you
till I had everything worked out.

01:49:56.322 --> 01:49:57.311
- Move over.
- Why?

01:49:57.457 --> 01:49:59.925
- So you can put your hands on me?
- Open the door.

01:50:00.059 --> 01:50:01.526
Come on, honey,
open the door.

01:50:01.628 --> 01:50:03.118
I got a lawyer,
we're gettin' a divorce

01:50:03.263 --> 01:50:05.163
and I'm gettin'
custody of the kids.

01:50:05.298 --> 01:50:08.290
- Let me in for a minute.
- No, I already made up my mind.

01:50:08.868 --> 01:50:10.392
I'm leavin'. That's it.

01:50:10.536 --> 01:50:13.130
Kids are gonna be with me,
and if you show your face around,

01:50:13.273 --> 01:50:14.535
I'm gonna call the cops on you.

01:50:14.674 --> 01:50:17.074
- All right? That's it.
- Don't act that way, honey.

01:50:43.603 --> 01:50:45.332
Come on, champ.
Come on, wake up.

01:50:45.471 --> 01:50:46.529
Wake up, champ.

01:50:50.143 --> 01:50:51.132
What's up?

01:50:52.979 --> 01:50:55.846
- We're from the D.A.
- Yeah, I know where you're from.

01:50:55.982 --> 01:50:58.246
- They wanna talk with you.
- Youse all look the same to me.

01:50:58.384 --> 01:51:00.750
- What's the difference?
- They wanna talk with you.

01:51:00.887 --> 01:51:02.821
- About what?
- I don't know, I don't run the joint.

01:51:02.956 --> 01:51:05.322
- They just told me to bring you in.
- But what do youse want?

01:51:05.458 --> 01:51:06.550
For what?

01:51:10.496 --> 01:51:12.327
Do you recognize this girl?

01:51:14.133 --> 01:51:15.395
She been in the club?

01:51:18.938 --> 01:51:21.202
- This is the same girl?
- Yeah.

01:51:22.875 --> 01:51:24.604
Nah, I don't know her.

01:51:24.744 --> 01:51:26.871
She says you introduced
her to some men.

01:51:27.013 --> 01:51:30.574
I introduced her to men. I introduce
a lot of people to a lot of people.

01:51:30.717 --> 01:51:34.983
You tell me I introduced her to men.
I introduced him to men.

01:51:35.555 --> 01:51:37.147
But I don't say nothin'.

01:51:37.290 --> 01:51:40.157
She's 14. Come on,
put on your shoes, Jake.

01:51:41.294 --> 01:51:43.091
- She's how old?
- Fourteen.

01:51:43.229 --> 01:51:45.163
She's 14?
Let me see that.

01:51:51.938 --> 01:51:53.428
Let me ask you somethin'.

01:51:55.074 --> 01:51:57.668
You gonna tell me that
that girl looks 14?

01:51:57.810 --> 01:51:59.903
- She's 14.
- I'm gonna ask you man to man.

01:52:00.046 --> 01:52:03.140
What am I gonna say?
Come on, we gotta go.

01:52:03.282 --> 01:52:05.614
- We gotta go downtown?
- That's right.

01:52:06.319 --> 01:52:08.253
For what,
because of this girl?

01:52:10.823 --> 01:52:12.916
- You drunk?
- Open the door, I'm out on bail.

01:52:13.059 --> 01:52:15.857
I just gotta pick up one thing
and I'll leave, I promise.

01:52:15.995 --> 01:52:17.656
- Kids are sleepin'.
- I won't bother them.

01:52:17.797 --> 01:52:19.389
Let me just get somethin'.

01:52:20.333 --> 01:52:22.130
All right, don't make no noise.

01:52:22.268 --> 01:52:23.235
- What?
- Don't make no noise.

01:52:23.369 --> 01:52:25.462
I won't,
I just gotta get this one thing.

01:52:28.274 --> 01:52:30.401
- What are you doin'?
- I gotta get $10,000.

01:52:30.543 --> 01:52:32.408
My lawyer says if I can
spread 10,000 around,

01:52:32.545 --> 01:52:34.740
- I can get the case dropped.
- They don't have a case against you.

01:52:34.881 --> 01:52:36.143
Oh, no?
You kiddin' me, or what?

01:52:36.282 --> 01:52:38.546
You ever see a 14-year-old
testify in court?

01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:44.089
You saw the papers...
"La Motta Out on Vice Rap."

01:52:44.223 --> 01:52:46.521
- What are you doin' to the belt?
- What difference does it make?

01:52:47.727 --> 01:52:49.354
Can't you get the money
from your friends?

01:52:49.495 --> 01:52:50.962
Yeah, what friends?

01:52:51.664 --> 01:52:54.224
You're gonna wake my kids up!

01:52:54.367 --> 01:52:56.699
You're gonna wake
the kids, stop it!

01:53:04.143 --> 01:53:05.110
What's the matter with you?

01:53:05.244 --> 01:53:07.712
Don't you put the dishes
so they don't fall down?

01:53:07.847 --> 01:53:09.906
What about the belt,
Mr. La Motta?

01:53:10.650 --> 01:53:12.845
Isn't that what you wanted
to sell me, the championship belt?

01:53:12.985 --> 01:53:15.920
- These are the jewels from the belt.
- But where's the belt?

01:53:16.055 --> 01:53:19.115
The belt of a champion
is a very rare item.

01:53:19.258 --> 01:53:22.125
I wish you'd come to me
in the first place, Mr. La Motta.

01:53:22.261 --> 01:53:23.592
You'd have had the belt
and the jewels together...

01:53:23.729 --> 01:53:25.128
Give me 2,000 for them.

01:53:25.264 --> 01:53:27.528
- Give me 2,000.
- 1,500 top, that's all...

01:53:27.667 --> 01:53:30.534
- You can't give me 2,000?
- 1,500 top, Mr. La Motta.

01:53:30.670 --> 01:53:33.537
- I'm sorry. I'd lose...
- Give me them.

01:53:34.107 --> 01:53:36.041
Don't tell me you're not
gonna make a profit.

01:53:36.175 --> 01:53:40.009
I know you're lyin'. Go around the corner,
I bet you I get twice what you're offerin'.

01:53:41.447 --> 01:53:43.540
I can't raise the 10,000.

01:53:44.784 --> 01:53:48.220
I tried, I tried.
I tried a lot of places.

01:53:48.955 --> 01:53:50.422
Yeah, but what am I gonna do?

01:53:51.457 --> 01:53:54.392
If that's what they're gonna do,
they're gonna do it, what can I do?

01:53:55.962 --> 01:53:58.692
Then fuck 'em, let 'em do
what they're gonna do.

01:54:00.967 --> 01:54:03.561
Get in the goddamn cell,
now, come on!

01:54:03.703 --> 01:54:07.264
- That's right, can't hurt folks no more.
- This is where it's at right here.

01:54:09.142 --> 01:54:11.667
Who was the one goddamn
tryin' to shirk, huh?

01:54:11.811 --> 01:54:14.075
- You'll pull your load here, boy.
- That's right.

01:54:14.213 --> 01:54:18.513
- I don't want no more!
- Get in the goddamn box!

01:54:18.651 --> 01:54:21.745
I'll break you on one of
my fuckin' farms, you son of a bitch!

01:54:21.888 --> 01:54:23.856
- Do you hear me?
- Go fuck yourself.

01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:26.686
- Hold onto him just a minute!
- I got it.

01:54:26.826 --> 01:54:28.293
See it? See it?!

01:54:28.828 --> 01:54:31.422
Look at it, son!
Live in it!

01:54:31.998 --> 01:54:34.091
Go on, boy, live in it!

01:54:34.233 --> 01:54:36.997
- Do you understand that?
- On your mother's cunt, then!

01:54:37.136 --> 01:54:38.228
Your mother's!

01:54:39.105 --> 01:54:41.130
- You cocksucker!
- Live in it!

01:54:42.608 --> 01:54:46.544
Let that son of a bitch sit,
fuck him!

01:54:46.946 --> 01:54:48.140
Fuck you!

01:54:50.616 --> 01:54:52.208
Fuck your mother!

01:55:29.255 --> 01:55:32.349
Dummy, dummy, dummy...

01:55:39.098 --> 01:55:41.191
Why? Why? Why?

01:56:00.786 --> 01:56:02.151
You motherfucker!

01:56:14.467 --> 01:56:15.559
My hands!

01:56:19.472 --> 01:56:20.666
Why'd you do it, why?

01:56:20.806 --> 01:56:23.172
You're so stupid,
you're so stupid,

01:56:23.309 --> 01:56:25.675
you're so fuckin' stupid!

01:56:25.811 --> 01:56:28.177
You're so stupid.

01:56:28.314 --> 01:56:31.112
They called me an animal.
I'm not an animal.

01:56:31.250 --> 01:56:32.615
I'm not an animal.

01:56:32.752 --> 01:56:37.121
Why do they treat me like this?
I'm not that bad. I'm not that bad.

01:56:39.992 --> 01:56:41.926
I'm not that guy.

01:56:59.945 --> 01:57:03.881
Guy comes home, finds his wife
in bed with another guy, the wife says,

01:57:04.016 --> 01:57:06.917
"Look who's here... big mouth.
Now the whole neighborhood will know."

01:57:08.621 --> 01:57:11.556
Thanks. Thanks for laughin'.
Spread it around a little bit.

01:57:13.125 --> 01:57:15.491
The first night I was here,
I said to the owner of the joint,

01:57:15.628 --> 01:57:18.563
I said, "Listen,
where's the toilet?"

01:57:18.698 --> 01:57:20.165
He said, "You're in it."

01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:23.268
Come on, let's go, let's go.

01:57:23.402 --> 01:57:25.370
Why don't you leave me alone?
I'm tryin' to do my routine.

01:57:25.504 --> 01:57:26.471
Up yours.

01:57:27.573 --> 01:57:30.269
Pal, you're gonna force me
to make a comeback.

01:57:30.409 --> 01:57:33.003
- Funny.
- Fuck you...

01:57:33.746 --> 01:57:35.509
And the horse you rode in on.

01:57:37.416 --> 01:57:39.509
And the whole cavalry behind ya.

01:57:40.419 --> 01:57:41.511
Funny man.

01:57:42.254 --> 01:57:43.846
That's why I'm here.

01:57:46.592 --> 01:57:47.854
Give him another drink.

01:57:48.427 --> 01:57:49.894
Piss in it for me.

01:57:52.098 --> 01:57:54.965
I'm now gonna introduce a woman
who's made a worldwide tour

01:57:55.101 --> 01:57:58.036
with top billing and all that
other bullshit where they all hated her.

01:57:58.938 --> 01:58:00.633
And I want you all
to give her a warm welcome.

01:58:00.773 --> 01:58:02.900
I know you're all capable of it.

01:58:03.042 --> 01:58:04.976
You look like a bunch of junkies.

01:58:05.945 --> 01:58:09.210
Her name is Emma 48's.

01:58:11.617 --> 01:58:14.211
Oh, yeah! Go get it!

01:58:29.135 --> 01:58:30.295
Taxi!

01:58:42.181 --> 01:58:43.307
Honey...

01:58:44.817 --> 01:58:46.478
Listen, I'm gonna take a little walk.

01:58:46.619 --> 01:58:49.110
I got a couple of things
I gotta take care of, all right?

01:58:49.255 --> 01:58:50.916
- Will I see you later?
- Yeah, here.

01:58:52.491 --> 01:58:54.254
- Take that, I'll be home later.
- Thank you.

01:58:55.995 --> 01:58:57.257
Be careful.

01:59:11.844 --> 01:59:13.209
Hey, what are you doin'?

01:59:13.345 --> 01:59:14.573
Joey.

01:59:18.083 --> 01:59:20.347
Come on, Joey.
Why don't you turn around?

01:59:32.731 --> 01:59:34.426
Come on, Joey,
turn around.

01:59:34.567 --> 01:59:36.296
Hey, Joey, come on.

01:59:49.482 --> 01:59:51.575
Come on, Joey?
What are you doin'?

01:59:51.717 --> 01:59:54.777
Come on. What are you
gettin' so angry about?

01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:56.683
Come on, be friends.

01:59:56.822 --> 01:59:58.312
Come on, you're my brother.

01:59:58.457 --> 01:59:59.924
- Be friends.
- I'm your brother?

02:00:00.059 --> 02:00:02.653
Yeah, ya fuckin' bum.
Give me a break, come on.

02:00:02.795 --> 02:00:03.853
- Kiss me.
- Come on, huh?

02:00:03.996 --> 02:00:05.463
Give me a kiss, come on.

02:00:05.998 --> 02:00:08.865
Wait, let me call my wife and kids.
Don't you want them to see the kiss?

02:00:09.001 --> 02:00:12.437
You gonna forgive and forget?
It's a long time ago, forget about it.

02:00:12.571 --> 02:00:14.038
Just give me a kiss, come on.

02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:15.932
Come on.

02:00:21.180 --> 02:00:23.705
You're my brother.
Come on.

02:00:25.751 --> 02:00:27.218
Come on, give me a kiss.

02:00:30.122 --> 02:00:31.714
- What?
- Come on.

02:00:33.292 --> 02:00:35.157
- How's everything, all right?
- Good.

02:00:35.294 --> 02:00:37.228
- Everything's all right?
- Yeah.

02:00:38.130 --> 02:00:40.064
- Family?
- All right.

02:00:44.303 --> 02:00:45.327
Come on.

02:00:45.471 --> 02:00:47.405
You don't wanna
do this here, come on.

02:00:48.474 --> 02:00:50.942
Let me call you,
we'll get together in a couple days.

02:00:51.043 --> 02:00:52.977
- You'll call me?
- I will.

02:00:53.646 --> 02:00:55.113
Don't forget.

02:00:56.315 --> 02:00:58.579
- I'll call you.
- All right.

02:01:10.062 --> 02:01:11.324
...won it legitimately...

02:01:12.998 --> 02:01:16.456
...and nobody could take that
away from me, nobody.

02:01:17.603 --> 02:01:19.628
Some people aren't that lucky.

02:01:21.006 --> 02:01:24.601
Like the one that Marlon Brando
played in On the Waterfront,

02:01:24.743 --> 02:01:27.371
an up-and-comer
who's now a down-and-outer.

02:01:27.513 --> 02:01:29.378
You remember that scene
in the back of the car

02:01:29.515 --> 02:01:32.075
with his brother Charley,
a small-time racket guy?

02:01:32.217 --> 02:01:33.980
And it went somethin' like this.

02:01:37.456 --> 02:01:40.050
"It wasn't him, Charley, it was you.

02:01:40.793 --> 02:01:43.318
"You remember that night at the Garden,
you came to my dressing room

02:01:43.462 --> 02:01:47.990
"and you said, 'Kid, this ain't your night.
We're goin' for the price on Wilson.'

02:01:48.133 --> 02:01:50.829
"Remember that?
'This ain't your night.'

02:01:50.970 --> 02:01:52.232
"My night.

02:01:52.805 --> 02:01:55.273
"I could've taken
Wilson apart that night.

02:01:55.374 --> 02:01:56.739
"So, what happens?

02:01:56.875 --> 02:02:00.242
"He gets a title shot outdoors
in the ballpark, and what do I get?

02:02:00.379 --> 02:02:02.506
"A one-way ticket to palookaville.

02:02:02.648 --> 02:02:05.845
"I was never no good
after that night, Charley.

02:02:05.985 --> 02:02:09.785
"It was like a peak you reach,
and then it's downhill.

02:02:11.657 --> 02:02:13.249
"It was you, Charley.

02:02:13.993 --> 02:02:15.585
"You was my brother.

02:02:16.161 --> 02:02:18.629
"You should've looked out
for me a little bit.

02:02:19.164 --> 02:02:21.860
"You should've looked out
for me just a little bit.

02:02:22.001 --> 02:02:25.027
"You should've taken care
of me just a little bit,

02:02:25.170 --> 02:02:28.936
"instead of making me take
them dives for the short-end money.

02:02:29.508 --> 02:02:31.271
"You don't understand.

02:02:32.011 --> 02:02:35.538
"I could've had class.
I could've been a contender.

02:02:35.681 --> 02:02:40.482
"I could've been somebody,
instead of a bum, which is what I am.

02:02:40.619 --> 02:02:44.214
"Let's face it...
it was you, Charley.

02:02:45.457 --> 02:02:48.051
- It was you, Charley."
- How you doin', Jake?

02:02:48.627 --> 02:02:50.561
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

02:02:51.296 --> 02:02:53.059
- Ready?
- You got about five minutes.

02:02:53.966 --> 02:02:55.331
- You need anything?
- No.

02:02:55.467 --> 02:02:56.559
You sure?

02:02:57.636 --> 02:02:58.728
I'm sure.

02:03:03.142 --> 02:03:06.236
- A lot of people out there?
- Yeah, it's crowded.

02:03:26.932 --> 02:03:28.524
Go get 'em, champ.

02:03:38.610 --> 02:03:40.544
I'm the boss, I'm the boss...

02:03:58.446 --> 02:04:04.538
<i>So, for the second time, [the Pharisees]</i>

02:04:06.504 --> 02:04:11.419
<i>summoned the man who
had been blind and said:</i>

02:04:12.512 --> 02:04:17.314
<i>"Speak the truth before God.
We know this fellow is a sinner."</i>

02:04:18.518 --> 02:04:21.682
<i>"Whether or not he is a sinner,
I do not know," The man replied.</i>

02:04:24.085 --> 02:04:30.856
<i>"All I know is this:
Once I was blind and now I can see."</i>
