WEBVTT

00:01.805 --> 00:04.769
All right, all right,
everyone start to shut up.

00:04.794 --> 00:06.606
I have some news today

00:06.631 --> 00:08.484
that is gonna make you guys so happy.

00:08.484 --> 00:10.020
You're gonna teach us biology?

00:11.456 --> 00:13.155
Nice, Sarika. No, guys,
be serious. Come on.

00:13.157 --> 00:14.354
Teach you biology.

00:14.379 --> 00:17.111
I was just at the bagel shop,
and I ran into my ex, Meredith.

00:17.136 --> 00:18.402
You seem to run into her a lot.

00:18.471 --> 00:20.027
It's kind of bordering on stalking.

00:20.027 --> 00:22.097
Marcus, you'd be lucky to
have someone stalking you.

00:22.265 --> 00:24.768
Oh, trust me. Being stalked is no picnic.

00:25.035 --> 00:26.167
I'm not stalking you.

00:26.236 --> 00:27.824
We have the same class schedule.

00:28.205 --> 00:30.572
Interesting. Yeah, well, anyway,

00:30.934 --> 00:32.767
Meredith mentioned that
she and her boyfriend

00:32.836 --> 00:34.636
are going through a bit of a rough patch.

00:34.705 --> 00:36.538
So I said, "Oh, my goodness.
I'm so sorry to hear that."

00:36.539 --> 00:37.827
Let me know if I can help."

00:37.898 --> 00:40.903
So basically, I'll be a
shoulder to cry on for a while

00:40.928 --> 00:44.002
and then transition to full-on boning.

00:44.303 --> 00:45.269
Huh.

00:47.807 --> 00:49.364
Yeah, well, there should
have been applause there.

00:49.542 --> 00:52.513
Okay, guys, let's do a
Miles update, shall we?

00:53.411 --> 00:55.899
No, tell me, what is the
first thing that comes up

00:56.115 --> 00:58.222
when you Google "Miles Leonard"?

00:58.984 --> 01:00.450
"Miles Leonard Stanford."

01:00.519 --> 01:02.369
"Miles Leonard handsome genius."

01:02.606 --> 01:03.678
"Miles Leonard shirtless."

01:03.678 --> 01:04.911
Okay, all right, thank you, Heather.

01:04.936 --> 01:06.292
"Miles Leonard great penis."

01:06.317 --> 01:07.331
Got it. Got it.

01:07.480 --> 01:08.511
We... we all got it.

01:08.511 --> 01:10.956
Okay, everybody take out your phones.

01:11.007 --> 01:13.641
I want you to Google
"Miles Leonard pedophile,"

01:13.710 --> 01:15.543
and just keep typing that in until it's

01:15.612 --> 01:16.904
the first result that comes up.

01:16.904 --> 01:19.305
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to be chatting

01:19.373 --> 01:21.340
with my friend.

01:23.688 --> 01:25.688
_

01:25.713 --> 01:28.514
Ohh, damn, homeboy.

01:30.284 --> 01:31.817

01:46.617 --> 01:48.667
So you guys watch "Wyoming" last night?

01:48.736 --> 01:51.036
- Mm-hmm.
- Best show ever.

01:51.105 --> 01:53.239
When the rancher tells
Father Tran that Sister Agnes

01:53.307 --> 01:54.807
is missing, I'm like...

01:54.876 --> 01:57.176
I know. It's, like, who kidnaps a nun?

01:57.245 --> 01:58.530
I have a theory about that.

01:58.530 --> 02:00.926
What if the whole show is
an erotic nightmare that the

02:00.951 --> 02:02.618
- Guys, guys, guys, guys.
- Security guard is having?

02:02.686 --> 02:04.236
No "Wyoming" spoilers, please.

02:04.236 --> 02:06.002
Ralph, how behind are you?

02:06.888 --> 02:08.610
My wife won't let me watch it,

02:08.610 --> 02:11.546
says it gets me too riled up,
and I yelp and gasp too much.

02:11.546 --> 02:13.212
Well, that's how you know it's good.

02:13.281 --> 02:15.047
As I said, the whole time
I'm watching, I'm like...

02:15.116 --> 02:17.416
No, him?

02:17.485 --> 02:19.151
Okay, fine. Maybe I'll sneak watch it

02:19.220 --> 02:20.853
when she goes and visits
her mom this summer,

02:20.922 --> 02:23.507
but for now, can we just
change the subject, please?

02:24.325 --> 02:26.492
Remember when Sister Agnes
coughed up those snakes...

02:26.561 --> 02:28.260
♪ La-la-la-la ♪

02:28.329 --> 02:29.962
♪ La-la-la-la ♪

02:30.031 --> 02:31.864
- ♪ La-la-la-la ♪
- My theory...

02:31.933 --> 02:33.509
- ♪ La-la-la ♪
- Ralph.

02:35.661 --> 02:36.669
God.

02:36.737 --> 02:38.604
Was he about to do the whole song?

02:40.474 --> 02:42.174
"Well, if he doesn't appreciate you,

02:42.243 --> 02:43.684
then that's his loss."

02:44.045 --> 02:45.540
Shoulder shrug emoji.

02:46.214 --> 02:48.816
Hey, Jack, can I ask you something?

02:50.218 --> 02:51.483
I am all ears.

02:51.483 --> 02:53.719
Well, there's this show, "Wyoming,"

02:53.744 --> 02:57.096
that I want to watch, but
my wife has asked me not to,

02:57.096 --> 02:59.163
which is pretty lame, right?

03:03.736 --> 03:05.934
- Yeah.
- I know, right?

03:06.159 --> 03:08.392
You know, but I can't
just go, "Hey, Brenda,

03:08.392 --> 03:09.691
"I don't care what you say.

03:09.760 --> 03:11.478
I'm gonna watch whatever I want."

03:15.220 --> 03:16.431
Whew.

03:16.500 --> 03:17.528
Why not?

03:17.902 --> 03:20.936
Why not? Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

03:21.005 --> 03:22.537
Yeah, I'm gonna do this.

03:22.606 --> 03:24.805
I'm gonna do this. Okay, it's a big day.

03:24.867 --> 03:26.376
It's a big, big day, Jack.

03:26.702 --> 03:28.560
Yes! Thank you, Jack.

03:29.138 --> 03:30.171
Yes!

03:31.273 --> 03:32.339
Okay.

03:35.218 --> 03:37.044
What's all this creepy
smiling you're doing?

03:37.646 --> 03:39.146
And why aren't you guys Googling?

03:39.215 --> 03:41.115
We did the math, and it
would take us eight months

03:41.183 --> 03:42.749
to alter the Google search algorithm.

03:42.818 --> 03:45.119
And frankly, that dog don't hunt.

03:45.187 --> 03:46.653
Well, then that dog gets put down.

03:47.067 --> 03:48.455
Did you just threaten to kill us?

03:48.524 --> 03:50.491
No, I just... I got
caught up in the metaphor.

03:50.559 --> 03:52.960
We do have an idea for a different mission,

03:53.028 --> 03:55.963
one that combines revenge and learning.

03:56.667 --> 03:59.073
If we got ahold of some of Miles' DNA,

03:59.157 --> 04:01.358
we could frame him for a
crime and ruin his life.

04:01.652 --> 04:03.919
We'd also learn a tiny
bit of biology along the way.

04:03.988 --> 04:07.044
But the important thing
is, we'd destroy Miles' ass.

04:07.044 --> 04:08.911
We'd destroy his ass, man.

04:08.980 --> 04:10.088
Hmm.

04:11.091 --> 04:13.658
I'm a little worried about
the whole "learn biology" part,

04:13.727 --> 04:16.675
but I am intrigued by the ass destruction.

04:17.564 --> 04:19.694
Okay, fine, you guys
can do the DNA mission.

04:23.136 --> 04:25.670
Hey, guys, if I send
Meredith two Apple emojis

04:25.739 --> 04:28.117
next to each other, is it clear
that I'm referring to her butt?

04:28.117 --> 04:29.662
It's definitely sexual.

04:29.687 --> 04:30.851
You know, make it all applesaucy.

04:30.920 --> 04:32.453
Bake it, Daddy.

04:32.521 --> 04:33.721
Okay, bob for cinnamon.

04:36.703 --> 04:38.926
Can anyone explain why everything

04:38.995 --> 04:41.159
in the nuns' convent is red?

04:41.213 --> 04:42.997
Ralph, you watched "Wyoming"?

04:43.065 --> 04:43.970
Yes.

04:43.995 --> 04:45.332
Yay.

04:45.401 --> 04:47.735
I told Brenda, "Look, I
know this show riles me up",

04:47.803 --> 04:49.637
"but you're just gonna have to suck it up

04:49.705 --> 04:51.038
and deal with it, baby."

04:51.107 --> 04:52.439
Just like Jack told me to.

04:53.042 --> 04:54.317
I told you what now?

04:54.317 --> 04:55.516
Yesterday in the hall you said, you know,

04:55.585 --> 04:57.137
"You've got to stand up to your wife."

04:57.254 --> 04:58.386
You have a wife?

04:58.455 --> 05:00.947
You know, and I can see
why you guys like the show,

05:01.064 --> 05:02.663
you know? It's... it's good.

05:02.732 --> 05:06.267
It's a little gross and
scary, but it's a good gross,

05:06.336 --> 05:08.380
and it's a fun scary, you know.

05:09.672 --> 05:11.305
Anyway, Brenda kicked me out.

05:12.876 --> 05:14.475
Yeah, so I... I got to go.

05:14.544 --> 05:17.066
I've got to gather up the
rest of my stuff, so...

05:19.682 --> 05:21.149
Jack, what did you do?

05:21.217 --> 05:22.483
Come on, nobody's gets
kicked out of their house

05:22.552 --> 05:24.385
for watching a TV show. That's crazy.

05:24.454 --> 05:27.155
You meddled in a complicated
marriage, and apparently,

05:27.223 --> 05:28.990
it was the straw the
broke the camel's back.

05:29.058 --> 05:30.758
Go talk to Durb immediately.

05:30.827 --> 05:31.926
What? No.

05:31.995 --> 05:33.006
Fine, don't.

05:33.288 --> 05:34.529
Well, now I'm going to.

05:34.764 --> 05:36.130
See how you can't control me.

05:36.511 --> 05:37.857
Wow, you got me.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.242
Oh, Ralph.

05:47.526 --> 05:48.609
Ahh.

05:48.678 --> 05:50.211
We have to be there for that man,

05:50.280 --> 05:52.413
that beautiful, beautiful man.

05:52.482 --> 05:54.097
- All right.
- Give me a hug, Jack.

05:56.786 --> 05:59.420
Hey, you okay?

06:00.823 --> 06:02.955
Honestly, I don't know.

06:03.293 --> 06:04.692
- Okay, well...
- He's so strong.

06:05.492 --> 06:07.128
Let us be strong for you.

06:07.197 --> 06:09.042
- Here, come on. Let's...
- Do you underst...

06:11.501 --> 06:12.544
Oh, my God.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.072
Come on!

06:15.705 --> 06:16.676
Wow.

06:17.327 --> 06:19.903
Hey, listen, I hope I didn't
screw anything up for you, man.

06:20.212 --> 06:22.612
If there's anything I can do to
help, you know, it's all good.

06:28.971 --> 06:30.443
- Oh.
- Hey-hey.

06:30.736 --> 06:31.853
Ralph, what are you doing here?

06:31.853 --> 06:33.653
Well, you said if there was
anything you could do to help,

06:33.722 --> 06:36.157
it was "all good," so...

06:36.345 --> 06:38.571
Pfff, I tell ya, that does not ring a bell.

06:38.636 --> 06:41.634
It's literally probably the most recent

06:41.634 --> 06:42.945
conversation you've had.

06:43.617 --> 06:45.684
Look, Jack, I need a place to stay,

06:45.752 --> 06:48.520
but if you can't do it, then it's fine.

06:48.589 --> 06:50.340
I'll just... I'll just go.

06:55.762 --> 06:57.095
Oh, good God, Ralph.

06:57.164 --> 06:58.330
Don't be so depressing.

06:58.398 --> 07:00.198
Look, fine. You can crash here.

07:00.267 --> 07:01.332
I can cr...

07:02.569 --> 07:04.169
Oh, what was that?

07:04.238 --> 07:06.071
I tried to click my heels together,

07:06.140 --> 07:08.673
but I was, like, going
down even before I went up.

07:08.945 --> 07:10.746
- Oh, you coming in?
- Yeah, yeah.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.880
Jack, I really, really appreciate this.

07:19.883 --> 07:22.917
Yeah, well... Ralph, I
let you in five minutes ago.

07:22.975 --> 07:24.662
How are you already in
full-flannel pajamas?

07:24.687 --> 07:26.220
Were you wearing those under your clothes?

07:26.245 --> 07:28.223
I'm pretty much always
ready to hit the sack.

07:28.728 --> 07:31.742
Is it weird if I sit on your couch?

07:31.767 --> 07:33.233
No, it's not weird to sit on the couch.

07:33.302 --> 07:34.834
- You're sleeping on the couch.
- Okay.

07:34.903 --> 07:38.238
Oh, and is it weird if I put
my vitamins on the coffee table?

07:38.307 --> 07:40.106
You don't have to ask to do normal stuff.

07:40.131 --> 07:41.330
You're right. I'm sorry.

07:41.355 --> 07:42.391
I'm just... I'm a little out of it.

07:42.391 --> 07:44.091
Guess I'm just missing Brenda, you know?

07:44.464 --> 07:45.964
Oh, her little sneezes,

07:46.048 --> 07:49.093
the way she would print up
Facebook to read at night,

07:49.248 --> 07:51.254
the way she would say, "Oh, I'm cold."

07:51.254 --> 07:53.218
She was always, always cold.

07:53.259 --> 07:54.825
Listen, can we not talk about your wife?

07:54.894 --> 07:56.794
I'm navigating this
sexually charged friendship

07:56.862 --> 07:58.128
with my ex, Meredith.

07:58.197 --> 08:00.731
Need to maintain a
playful, erotic mental state

08:00.800 --> 08:02.499
in order to transition from the friend zone

08:02.568 --> 08:05.236
to the sex... zone.

08:05.304 --> 08:06.604
You know, I totally get it.

08:06.672 --> 08:08.739
I... I should be turning in myself.

08:08.808 --> 08:10.708
So how do you want to do good nights?

08:10.776 --> 08:12.810
I mean, a handshake feels so formal.

08:12.878 --> 08:15.846
I could be talked into a hug,
but I'm not married to it.

08:16.624 --> 08:18.249
Although, really,

08:18.441 --> 08:20.641
I'm not married to much
of anything anymore.

08:20.983 --> 08:23.352
I mean, do... do you want
to, like, high-five or...

08:25.882 --> 08:27.203
Okay, good night.

08:37.227 --> 08:38.206
Here.

08:38.816 --> 08:39.948
This way.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.236
Quickly.

08:41.304 --> 08:43.138
Thaddeus told me you would come.

08:43.207 --> 08:44.906
You'll be safe here till morning.

08:44.974 --> 08:46.073
Quick, get under here.

08:46.142 --> 08:47.172
I have bread.

08:47.208 --> 08:49.710
At dawn, you will run north to freedom.

08:49.779 --> 08:50.996
I need to thanks, sir.

08:50.997 --> 08:53.231
I'm just doing my duty as a good Quaker.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.763
Rub this deer urine on you.

08:54.788 --> 08:56.512
It'll throw off the hounds.

09:02.390 --> 09:04.601
Uh, Jack, um...

09:05.734 --> 09:06.800
I have a confession.

09:07.151 --> 09:10.004
I, uh, I peed last night.

09:10.029 --> 09:11.362
Oh, God. Where?

09:11.405 --> 09:13.305
Oh, in the toilet, but I
wasn't sure if you had an issue

09:13.374 --> 09:14.706
with it or not.

09:14.775 --> 09:17.042
If you do, I'll go outside when it's dark.

09:18.149 --> 09:19.591
How are things going with Meredith?

09:20.114 --> 09:21.121
Bad.

09:21.146 --> 09:22.545
It's kind of hard to sleep with you

09:22.614 --> 09:23.913
shouting weird stuff all night.

09:23.982 --> 09:26.783
Oh, no. I sleepwalk when I'm stressed.

09:27.162 --> 09:28.728
I... it's... what did I say?

09:28.797 --> 09:30.096
It sounded like you were working for the...

09:30.165 --> 09:31.497
Underground railroad.

09:31.566 --> 09:33.299
Yeah, that's a recurring dream I have.

09:33.368 --> 09:35.159
- I don't know why.
- I know why.

09:35.370 --> 09:36.554
Where did she come from?

09:36.554 --> 09:38.754
He has that dream
because this man is a saint.

09:39.039 --> 09:41.792
Every night he risks
his life to help people.

09:41.859 --> 09:42.858
Jack, that's a white man.

09:42.927 --> 09:44.160
He could look the other way.

09:44.228 --> 09:45.728
Okay, I'm sorry. Explain why you're here.

09:45.797 --> 09:47.001
Oh, I'm making breakfast.

09:47.198 --> 09:48.589
Come on. Come look.

09:53.045 --> 09:55.299
Hope you boys like bacon and eggs.

09:55.981 --> 09:57.881
I'm here because his life is falling apart.

09:57.950 --> 09:59.877
Not that Ralph needs any help.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.551
He could snap at any minute.

10:01.620 --> 10:03.131
You're doing great, Ralph.

10:03.922 --> 10:05.759
I'm gonna take all these knives.

10:05.759 --> 10:06.925
What?

10:06.993 --> 10:08.168
What are you doing?

10:08.168 --> 10:11.164
Hey, Jack, I want to
do something to thank you.

10:11.201 --> 10:13.209
How about I cook dinner tonight, all right?

10:13.236 --> 10:14.903
Clams Durbin. How does that sound?

10:14.971 --> 10:17.038
Oh, Clams Durbin.

10:17.299 --> 10:19.199
It's delicious. You've got to try it.

10:19.268 --> 10:20.700
So much dairy in it.

10:20.769 --> 10:22.335
Oh, it's so good.

10:22.404 --> 10:23.473
Yeah, I don't think so.

10:23.473 --> 10:25.389
Well, it can be anything.
It doesn't have to be clams.

10:25.414 --> 10:26.813
Oh, it does. It has to be clams.

10:26.882 --> 10:27.981
That's kind of what I'm thinking.

10:28.049 --> 10:29.382
I don't want your clams, man.

10:29.451 --> 10:31.251
Well, okay, I'll do
all the grocery shopping.

10:31.319 --> 10:33.319
And I'll restock the liquor cabinet.

10:33.388 --> 10:34.331
Okay, fine.

10:34.356 --> 10:35.312
Yes.

10:35.857 --> 10:39.458
Oh, it's gonna make you
sick, but it's worth it.

10:41.496 --> 10:42.615
Hey, gang.

10:43.298 --> 10:45.098
Now, where are you guys
with this Miles plan, huh?

10:45.167 --> 10:47.600
You guys make any headway?
Has he been arrested yet?

10:47.669 --> 10:49.836
We have been making some great strides.

10:50.288 --> 10:53.173
So we started talking about
planting Miles' DNA at a crime

10:53.241 --> 10:55.175
scene, but then we realized
we weren't really positive

10:55.243 --> 10:56.876
what qualifies as a DNA sample.

10:56.945 --> 10:59.379
You're gonna want blood,
semen, hair, and saliva.

10:59.448 --> 11:00.580
That's your bread and butter.

11:00.649 --> 11:01.949
Oh, and feces.

11:02.350 --> 11:04.417
And it's considered such
strong evidence that it can

11:04.486 --> 11:06.061
put people away for life.

11:07.131 --> 11:08.525
I'm liking what I'm hearing, guys.

11:08.601 --> 11:10.001
Well, buckle up.

11:10.101 --> 11:11.277
Tell him, bro.

11:11.703 --> 11:13.436
If his DNA's found at a crime scene,

11:13.505 --> 11:15.738
a lab will compare it to a reference sample

11:15.807 --> 11:17.240
checking for any matching alleles.

11:17.309 --> 11:18.975
And here's where it gets dope.

11:19.044 --> 11:20.944
If the alleles on the
chromosome are the same,

11:21.012 --> 11:22.745
they're homozygous.

11:22.814 --> 11:24.581
As opposed to heterozygous...

11:24.649 --> 11:25.715
No!

11:29.421 --> 11:30.899
Oh, I'm such a fool.

11:33.024 --> 11:34.289
Foolish Jack.

11:35.093 --> 11:38.133
I wanted so badly to believe
that you were good kids.

11:38.697 --> 11:39.837
But you're not.

11:41.399 --> 11:43.253
You're bad kids, aren't you?

11:43.925 --> 11:44.958
We're bad kids.

11:45.136 --> 11:46.073
Yeah.

11:47.239 --> 11:48.671
You're doing this to learn biology.

11:48.740 --> 11:50.595
You don't give a damn
about destroying my rival.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.108
We just thought it would help to have

11:52.177 --> 11:53.710
a basic understanding of DNA.

11:53.778 --> 11:56.045
It's in saliva, and it
makes people go to jail.

11:56.114 --> 11:57.274
That's all you need to know.

11:57.275 --> 11:59.033
Now, you've got one day
to get somewhere with this

11:59.058 --> 12:01.396
or it's back to typing "pedophile" all day.

12:01.860 --> 12:02.872
No...

12:12.240 --> 12:13.673
Oh, my God. This is wild.

12:13.675 --> 12:15.141
You know what I mean? Brenda never let me

12:15.143 --> 12:16.409
- drink in the house.
- Uh-huh.

12:16.411 --> 12:18.377
There's so much new stuff I can try.

12:18.804 --> 12:20.908
I could wear a Kangol hat.

12:20.908 --> 12:21.924
Yeah.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.842
Oh, no way.

12:23.911 --> 12:26.545
Hey, Ralph, why don't you go rustle up

12:26.613 --> 12:28.146
some Clams Durbin after all?

12:28.215 --> 12:30.043
Yes, you will not regret this.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.450
Each clam is a symphony
of taste pulled from

12:32.519 --> 12:33.919
the cleaner parts of Lake Erie.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.661
Yeah, go ahead.

12:37.607 --> 12:40.091
Well, hey there, text buddy.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.259
Hey, Jack.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.862
Oh, cookie dough, frozen tamales,

12:43.931 --> 12:45.130
and a gallon of ice cream.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.498
You doing some emotional eating?

12:46.567 --> 12:48.133
What are you doing? You're doing, like,

12:48.201 --> 12:49.467
a "Leaving Las Vegas" drink
yourself to death thing?

12:50.848 --> 12:51.913
I wish.

12:52.033 --> 12:54.600
Hey, so how are things with the boyfriend?

12:54.669 --> 12:56.851
Ehh, well, so I took your advice.

12:56.852 --> 12:58.618
Thank you, by the way, for letting me vent.

12:58.687 --> 12:59.920
You've really been keeping me sane.

12:59.988 --> 13:01.755
Oh, well, I'm glad to hear it.

13:01.824 --> 13:03.356
- I want to help; I just...
- Hey, roomie.

13:03.425 --> 13:05.292
I figured I would get the saffron first,

13:05.360 --> 13:08.795
because you cannot make Clams
Durbin without the saffron.

13:08.864 --> 13:10.397
- Right.
- Oh, hey, I'm Ralph.

13:10.466 --> 13:11.398
Meredith.

13:11.467 --> 13:12.499
Meredith.

13:12.568 --> 13:14.167
This is the famous Meredith

13:14.236 --> 13:15.769
that Jack is always talking about.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.037
- No.
- Let me tell you something.

13:17.106 --> 13:19.639
Jack is the smartest man I've ever met.

13:19.708 --> 13:22.469
He's a true catch. He's a classic lover.

13:22.745 --> 13:25.312
And I know right now he's
just a shoulder to cry on,

13:25.380 --> 13:27.053
but oh, boy, he could be so much more.

13:27.053 --> 13:28.619
- Okay.
- Right.

13:28.949 --> 13:31.399
But technically, I still
have a boyfriend, so...

13:31.952 --> 13:33.291
Yes, she... yeah.

13:35.059 --> 13:36.182
Um...

13:39.847 --> 13:40.826
Yep.

13:42.137 --> 13:43.470
It was nice to see you, Jack.

13:43.471 --> 13:45.171
- Yeah, good to see you. Bye.
- Nice meeting you.

13:45.240 --> 13:46.672
I'll shoot you a text or something.

13:46.741 --> 13:47.807
Don't drink too much.

13:49.043 --> 13:50.776
- You...
- She said... hey, I tried.

13:50.845 --> 13:53.412
You know, I'm not... I'm
not very good at this.

13:53.481 --> 13:54.779
- No.
- Next time, you've got to

13:54.885 --> 13:56.212
speak up, you know.

13:56.212 --> 13:58.627
When I set it up like that,
you... boom... you spike it.

13:59.181 --> 14:00.247
All right?

14:00.510 --> 14:02.245
Hey, don't be mad.

14:04.887 --> 14:05.924
Here.

14:06.556 --> 14:09.089
Freedom lies this way, I promise you.

14:09.158 --> 14:10.457
Take this quilt.

14:10.898 --> 14:12.898
It is a map to Ontario.

14:12.966 --> 14:14.327
Shh, shh, wait, wait.

14:15.072 --> 14:16.323
I hear more people.

14:16.368 --> 14:18.902
It's more white men. I will distract them

14:19.276 --> 14:20.609
with bird calls.

14:22.746 --> 14:23.935
Loo-da-loo-da-loo.

14:25.782 --> 14:29.350
The Lady Rams volleyball squad
got annihilated last night

14:29.866 --> 14:33.711
again, but hey, sometimes
you lose for 10 years,

14:34.091 --> 14:36.354
12 if you count the time you dated,

14:36.835 --> 14:40.612
<i>16 if you actually are the
girls' volleyball team,</i>

14:40.706 --> 14:44.066
<i>but point is, gals, you never
know what's around the corner.</i>

14:44.513 --> 14:46.780
Hey, Durbin needs to
crash with one of you guys.

14:46.849 --> 14:48.553
Oh, I can't. It's too dangerous.

14:48.784 --> 14:51.517
Single Durbin is giving off
some weird sex pheromones.

14:51.517 --> 14:53.117
Yes.

14:53.186 --> 14:56.520
<i>Next season, the world
is full of possibilities.</i>

14:56.757 --> 14:59.158
<i>You've got to smell every flower.</i>

14:59.226 --> 15:01.149
- Oh, come on. <i>
- Get sniffing, kids.</i>

15:01.683 --> 15:03.128
Look, look, something's
got to give, all right?

15:03.197 --> 15:04.596
He's all up in my
business. I haven't slept.

15:04.665 --> 15:06.098
He almost ruined things with Meredith.

15:06.167 --> 15:07.129
Tough, Jack.

15:07.129 --> 15:08.902
I don't see him getting back
with Brenda any time soon.

15:09.004 --> 15:10.011
Mm-mm.

15:10.873 --> 15:12.172
<i>So after Sister Agnes vanished,</i>

15:12.241 --> 15:13.407
<i>I noticed the...</i>

15:13.475 --> 15:14.441
Come in.

15:14.855 --> 15:16.031
Hey, Durbin.

15:16.979 --> 15:18.712
- I've got to talk to you, man.
- There's my guy.

15:18.781 --> 15:21.315
Hey, how good were those clams last night?

15:21.627 --> 15:23.192
You know what the best
thing about clams is?

15:23.193 --> 15:26.127
Leftovers. Whoo.

15:26.196 --> 15:27.385
Seriously, though, I...

15:27.664 --> 15:29.163
I feel like this
separation is the best thing

15:29.232 --> 15:30.198
that's ever happened to me.

15:30.267 --> 15:31.799
Hangin' with my bro.

15:31.868 --> 15:33.707
I just feel so happy and free.

15:33.732 --> 15:35.336
Yeah, well, you know what...

15:35.405 --> 15:36.974
You know what might make you even happier?

15:37.459 --> 15:39.393
Getting back together
with your precious Debra.

15:39.461 --> 15:41.728
Brenda, but seriously,
as I was saying earlier,

15:41.797 --> 15:43.597
I just feel like more
and more that situation

15:43.665 --> 15:44.915
was not a good thing.

15:44.915 --> 15:46.789
Yeah, but it was love, Ralph, right?

15:47.218 --> 15:48.450
And you didn't fight for it.

15:48.519 --> 15:50.753
Ralph, you didn't fight for love.

15:51.311 --> 15:52.549
But what if you did?

15:52.790 --> 15:55.269
And what if you did it with
the help of a Harvard professor?

15:55.903 --> 15:58.003
I guess that sounds good.

15:58.297 --> 15:59.864
I'd like to share a
philosophy nugget with you

15:59.932 --> 16:00.872
if I may.

16:00.872 --> 16:02.171
Yes. Oh, I've been waiting for this.

16:02.241 --> 16:04.541
Okay, a stoic named Epictetus said,

16:04.610 --> 16:06.299
"If a storm hits your boat,

16:06.612 --> 16:08.950
"sometimes the only option is to drown,

16:09.201 --> 16:11.568
"but do so quietly without crying,

16:11.635 --> 16:14.234
for what is born must also die."

16:15.571 --> 16:17.438
Holy cow. That is rough.

16:18.024 --> 16:19.341
But you get the point, right?

16:21.275 --> 16:22.792
- Ralph.
- Yes?

16:23.914 --> 16:25.189
It's time to go home.

16:27.173 --> 16:30.199
Ralph, it's time to go home.

16:32.578 --> 16:35.119
Ralph, what do you say?

16:39.384 --> 16:40.850
It's time to go home.

16:40.919 --> 16:41.875
There it is.

16:42.391 --> 16:44.209
My man.

16:49.063 --> 16:52.324
Thank you so much for sitting
down and talking to us, Brenda.

16:52.367 --> 16:55.401
The headline here is
that Ralph is a good dude,

16:55.403 --> 16:58.441
and, well, he wants to apologize.

16:58.722 --> 17:00.688
Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry
that I watched that show

17:00.690 --> 17:02.236
that riles me up.

17:02.261 --> 17:03.338
Yeah, that was bad.

17:04.330 --> 17:05.597
Oh, there's one of those
little teeny-tiny sneezes

17:05.665 --> 17:07.403
you were telling me about.

17:07.428 --> 17:09.201
Brenda, Ralph, he...

17:09.269 --> 17:11.203
He misses you mad, and he wants you back,

17:11.271 --> 17:13.077
so what do you say, huh?

17:15.303 --> 17:17.136
It's more than just that show.

17:17.205 --> 17:18.672
Well, yeah, of course, yeah, sure.

17:18.740 --> 17:20.607
Well, talk to us, you
know. What else, you know?

17:20.632 --> 17:21.656
I bet it's all fixable.

17:21.656 --> 17:24.901
Well, he does the blender
so loud in the morning.

17:25.183 --> 17:27.650
Okay, well, easy fix. No blender till noon.

17:27.718 --> 17:29.218
And most nights he sleepwalks,

17:29.287 --> 17:32.121
and he's yelling about hiding families,

17:32.190 --> 17:33.656
and I need to sleep in another room.

17:33.724 --> 17:36.108
Yeah, well, Roger that one big time.

17:36.360 --> 17:39.061
So if Ralph were able
to make those changes,

17:39.130 --> 17:41.273
you think you guys could get back together?

17:42.433 --> 17:43.795
Mm, ow, oh.

17:43.860 --> 17:45.885
Oh, God. I don't know.

17:46.265 --> 17:47.264
My back is killing me.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.958
I... I know this is silly, but

17:48.983 --> 17:51.302
you're sitting on those
cushions, and I need them.

17:51.879 --> 17:53.769
Oh, well, that's... no, that's not silly.

17:53.769 --> 17:55.035
I didn't realize I was
sitting in your chair.

17:55.103 --> 17:56.236
I'm sorry. You want to switch chairs?

17:56.305 --> 17:57.537
Well, stop yelling at me.

17:57.606 --> 17:59.172
Why do you want to make me feel bad?

17:59.544 --> 18:01.241
I mean, it's your chair now.

18:01.310 --> 18:02.475
You're the guest.

18:02.544 --> 18:04.329
I'll just endure the back pain.

18:04.613 --> 18:06.561
Well, here's a fix.

18:06.748 --> 18:08.348
Why don't I take the
cushions off this chair

18:08.417 --> 18:09.916
and put them on that chair?

18:09.985 --> 18:12.419
No, but then your back will
be hurting as much as mine

18:12.487 --> 18:14.187
is hurting, and then I am gonna feel bad

18:14.256 --> 18:15.355
about doing that to you.

18:15.424 --> 18:16.990
I would feel bad about that.

18:17.059 --> 18:17.991
Oh, oh, God.

18:18.010 --> 18:20.123
Oh, my back is hurting
so bad. Oh, it's hurting.

18:20.148 --> 18:21.714
Oh. Oh!

18:21.783 --> 18:23.116
You've got to leave that woman.

18:23.184 --> 18:24.217
I know.

18:24.676 --> 18:26.496
I mean, at first, she
was complaining about you,

18:26.521 --> 18:28.289
and I was like, "Whatever,"
and then she turned it on me,

18:28.314 --> 18:29.616
and I was like, "Pfff, that's no good."

18:29.731 --> 18:31.903
She's bad news, brother, and
if that means you've got to stay

18:31.903 --> 18:33.787
here a couple more nights, it's all good.

18:34.125 --> 18:36.515
Mucho mucho appreciated.

18:36.827 --> 18:38.226
God, you and I, we are a...

18:38.295 --> 18:40.061
We are a couple of pieces of work, huh?

18:40.130 --> 18:42.464
Yeah. Whoa, how so?

18:42.532 --> 18:44.566
Well, I mean, at least my
dysfunctional relationship

18:44.635 --> 18:45.800
was a relationship.

18:45.869 --> 18:47.602
It wasn't this one-way obsession

18:47.671 --> 18:49.182
with my high school ex.

18:52.315 --> 18:55.137
That was a massive overstep, wasn't it?

18:56.186 --> 18:57.395
No. You know what?

18:57.597 --> 18:59.130
I like this color on you, Ralph.

18:59.198 --> 19:01.398
I do, and you're not
totally wrong about Meredith.

19:01.467 --> 19:02.509
Hey, no kidding.

19:02.510 --> 19:04.720
Listen, she's got a boyfriend, all right?

19:04.989 --> 19:06.348
You're deluding yourself, bro.

19:06.349 --> 19:07.557
Okay, now it's too much.

19:08.923 --> 19:10.523
Hey, which one of these
pills calms you down?

19:10.593 --> 19:12.359
All uppers.

19:12.428 --> 19:13.360
Oh, no.

19:13.429 --> 19:14.433
Oh, no.

19:26.781 --> 19:28.485
_

19:28.664 --> 19:29.861
Nope, uh-uh.

19:29.886 --> 19:31.552
Shut it down. Shut it all down right now.

19:31.577 --> 19:33.377
Whatever biology you're
studying back there,

19:33.402 --> 19:34.435
it's done, okay?

19:34.485 --> 19:35.993
Back to the Miles missions.

19:36.212 --> 19:38.445
As we said, this is both.

19:38.547 --> 19:40.372
I think you'll be pleased with this.

19:42.317 --> 19:44.690
I got a lock of Miles' hair, boss.

19:48.390 --> 19:50.660
"And a little child shall lead them."

19:51.993 --> 19:53.147
How'd you do this?

19:53.147 --> 19:55.314
Remember when you had me
send him that catfish message?

19:55.383 --> 19:56.682
- Mm-hmm.
- It blossomed into a very

19:56.751 --> 19:59.436
complicated online relationship.

19:59.468 --> 20:02.131
Wow, okay. Well, kudos.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.342
Now I think it's probably
best that you cut off all ties

20:04.381 --> 20:06.406
to this 40-year-old
man forever.

20:06.816 --> 20:09.323
Oh, it's gonna be much easier
after the holidays, chief.

20:09.552 --> 20:11.286
Looks like I underestimated you guys.

20:11.354 --> 20:13.454
I mean, hell, if it takes
five minutes of biology a day

20:13.523 --> 20:15.323
to destroy my rival,
then maybe it's worth it.

20:15.392 --> 20:17.464
All right, go ahead and
take your seats, yeah.

20:18.094 --> 20:21.463
All right, so what's the next step?

20:21.898 --> 20:23.937
We find a murdered body.

20:24.013 --> 20:25.017
What?

20:25.617 --> 20:27.263
Damn it. That's the next step?

20:27.715 --> 20:29.014
That is a very hard next step.

20:29.083 --> 20:30.983
You luck into a murdered body

20:31.051 --> 20:32.997
presumably before the police have arrived?

20:33.022 --> 20:34.186
That's insane.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.809
All right, take out your
phones and start typing

20:35.835 --> 20:37.770
"Miles Leonard pedophile" into Google.

20:38.005 --> 20:39.745
Luck into a murdered body.

20:39.770 --> 20:41.139
What are you talking about?

20:41.574 --> 20:42.975
You want me to throw away the hair?

20:44.514 --> 20:46.143
No, why don't you go
ahead and keep the hair?

20:46.168 --> 20:47.867
You know, this is Toledo after all.

20:47.892 --> 20:49.190
There's probably a dead
body somewhere in this room.
