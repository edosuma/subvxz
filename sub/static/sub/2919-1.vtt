02:30.400 --> 02:32.734
Ayodele, good health,

02:32.819 --> 02:34.236
love,

02:35.071 --> 02:36.446
for both of you.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.241
Give me good kids.

02:44.122 --> 02:48.208
We'll always be here for you.

02:49.544 --> 02:50.752
I wanna second that.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.755
Good health.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.008
A strong long life.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.843
Your secrets will remain intact.

02:57.927 --> 02:59.261
Your crown will stay
long on your head.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.679
Your shoes will last long
on your feet.

03:00.763 --> 03:02.181
In the power of the Almighty,

03:02.765 --> 03:04.141
in the power of the Oshun,

03:04.309 --> 03:05.767
in the power of all our Orishas,

03:06.519 --> 03:08.812
arise, arise.

03:56.361 --> 03:59.238
Adenike, you and your husband,

03:59.989 --> 04:02.074
nothing will ruin you two.

04:02.867 --> 04:04.660
You will give birth to a son.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.578
You will give birth
to a daughter too.

04:06.663 --> 04:08.413
You will give birth to twins,
as well.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.374
That will do now.

04:10.833 --> 04:12.125
You and your husband

04:12.210 --> 04:13.669
will not know suffering,

04:14.587 --> 04:16.338
will one day sit and
relax the way I am,

04:16.422 --> 04:19.091
and enjoy your children the way
I am enjoying you now.

04:37.777 --> 04:40.696
Adenike, like these bananas

04:42.532 --> 04:45.409
you will not be bruised
in your marriage.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.875
Pineapples are always sweet.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.920
Your life will always be sweet.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.488
- You look wonderful!
- So do you.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.157
- Your head wrap, everything, so nice.
- Thank you.

05:25.241 --> 05:26.742
- You are coming from Lagos?
- Mm-mmm.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.660
I live here in Brooklyn now.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.787
Ah. That's good.

05:30.872 --> 05:33.415
Î—ey, I didn't forget everything.

05:48.848 --> 05:52.059
- You have cause for me today, Sade.
- Uh-huh.

06:26.719 --> 06:31.515
To you, dear Adenike,
the woman of my life.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.189
Mama.

06:40.274 --> 06:43.360
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

06:43.444 --> 06:45.070
God bless.

08:04.066 --> 08:08.987
This is to ensure fertility...

08:09.071 --> 08:11.114
and prosperity.

08:14.035 --> 08:17.746
Go on. Put it round your waist.

08:40.937 --> 08:44.105
If Ayodele's father
were to be alive today...

08:44.190 --> 08:46.066
the party wouldn't have ended.

08:46.150 --> 08:47.651
I know.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.489
He would be dancing...

08:52.573 --> 08:55.992
and causing everybody
to havin' a good time.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.786
Like his sons.

08:57.870 --> 09:01.081
Right. Like his sons.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.334
That is why...

09:04.418 --> 09:06.169
I pray...

09:06.754 --> 09:08.922
every day...

09:09.006 --> 09:11.466
that to bear him a son...

09:11.551 --> 09:14.052
that will be named...

09:14.136 --> 09:18.890
George Babatunde Balogun.

09:24.146 --> 09:26.147
And this...

09:26.232 --> 09:30.235
This is what I used to carry
Ayodele on my back.

09:33.864 --> 09:35.824
I want you to take it

09:37.535 --> 09:40.495
and carry your child with it.

09:47.503 --> 09:50.088
Use it to carry my first grandchild.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.930
Don't cry, don't cry.

09:59.890 --> 10:02.726
Our prayers have been answered.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.908
Where's my younger brother?

10:19.785 --> 10:21.077
Biyi?

10:23.164 --> 10:24.331
Where is he?

10:24.415 --> 10:26.291
Biyi!

10:29.295 --> 10:31.379
Come sit next to me.
Come, come, come.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.318
When you fool around...

10:53.402 --> 10:55.111
Yemi... No, not me.

10:57.073 --> 11:00.075
Pretend as nothing happened.

11:04.622 --> 11:08.958
When a goat strays,
he must always return home.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.920
Because home is where your
peace and happiness dwells.

11:12.004 --> 11:14.506
Always come home to sleep over.

11:14.590 --> 11:17.342
Always come home to eat.

11:17.426 --> 11:20.720
And even if you have eaten,
come home to eat again.

11:23.933 --> 11:26.935
You must provide her
with a good home.

11:28.437 --> 11:32.065
A home full with children.

11:32.566 --> 11:34.359
Get busy.

11:42.451 --> 11:44.202
Let's share this with our Orishas,

11:44.286 --> 11:45.286
our ancestors,

11:45.371 --> 11:46.538
and the Almighty

11:46.622 --> 11:48.456
to answer our prayers.

13:58.754 --> 14:00.088
Mami.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.924
Adenike.

19:45.475 --> 19:47.518
You didn't have to do this.

19:47.603 --> 19:50.396
I have last night's specials
waiting for me.

19:50.480 --> 19:54.275
What you make here is for
everyone else.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.732
What the hell?

20:34.816 --> 20:36.651
Delicious.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.501
Nike!

20:56.338 --> 20:57.672
Hey!

21:06.682 --> 21:07.640
Thanks for meeting me.

21:07.666 --> 21:09.667
Of course. Look.
I match your shirt now.

21:09.726 --> 21:12.103
Yeah, exactly. Perfectly.

21:12.187 --> 21:14.522
- How are you?
- Okay. How are you?

21:14.606 --> 21:17.316
Oh, everywhere. It's everywhere.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.527
Um...

21:19.611 --> 21:22.363
- I need to get this out.
- We're gonna go...

21:22.447 --> 21:24.657
to this really great store
over there...

21:24.741 --> 21:26.826
- and get you a new shirt.
- No.

21:26.910 --> 21:29.912
- I don't need a new shirt.
- Yes!

21:29.997 --> 21:33.416
I'm fine. I'll just go wash it
when I go home. It's fine.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.126
Okay.

21:35.210 --> 21:37.295
With the new shirt on.

21:37.379 --> 21:38.921
Come.

21:40.007 --> 21:42.216
- Come, come, come.
- Oh, no, no.

21:45.220 --> 21:47.430
You doin' all right in there?

22:04.614 --> 22:06.824
It is transparent.

22:06.908 --> 22:08.868
It's supposed to be.

22:10.203 --> 22:12.079
Tuck it in.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.338
Like this.

22:20.422 --> 22:22.715
You can see everything!

22:25.469 --> 22:27.595
- Then go braless.
- Hey!

22:29.639 --> 22:32.099
Ayodele will love it.

22:36.104 --> 22:38.105
It's too much money.

22:49.826 --> 22:51.786
You remember Sade?

22:57.751 --> 22:59.168
Go there.

23:01.922 --> 23:03.756
Okay. Okay.

23:05.717 --> 23:07.885
What's this?

23:07.969 --> 23:09.929
Sade bought it for me.

23:10.013 --> 23:12.056
It's a little transparent.

23:12.140 --> 23:14.141
I thought that you would like it.

23:15.310 --> 23:18.104
I do, I do, but not
for everyone else to see.

24:11.950 --> 24:14.034
Go on.

24:23.795 --> 24:25.588
- Mama...
- Come on, come on.

24:25.672 --> 24:27.423
Take another sip.

24:27.507 --> 24:29.717
Go on, please.

24:47.986 --> 24:51.655
- Twice a day?
- Morning and evening.

25:08.048 --> 25:10.049
I want to get a job.

25:14.971 --> 25:16.931
Join the crowd.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.809
I can use my skills.

25:22.479 --> 25:25.773
You know how many Africans I
know with PhD driving taxis?

25:33.823 --> 25:37.284
You want to work?
Work for me. Or work with me.

25:37.369 --> 25:40.788
I don't want your money, Ayo.
I want my own.

26:14.948 --> 26:17.241
This thing is not...

26:17.325 --> 26:19.285
Can you take the, um...

26:20.579 --> 26:23.706
This neckline down a little bit?

26:24.833 --> 26:26.584
For what?

26:32.507 --> 26:35.384
- All right.
- It's very nice as it is.

26:35.468 --> 26:39.513
It's beautiful. You know, I'd just like
it just to be a little bit lower.

26:41.099 --> 26:43.183
Not for this dress.

26:43.852 --> 26:46.854
This one is not going to do that.

28:32.502 --> 28:36.004
I just want to keep us
a secret for now.

28:47.809 --> 28:49.893
Okay, I'm just showing you now.
Enjoy.

28:49.978 --> 28:52.104
- Okay.
- Isn't that better?

28:52.188 --> 28:55.482
- Ah, it's a little better.
- The music is sweet to you now, Adi.

28:58.862 --> 29:01.071
Ah! Too loud!

29:04.826 --> 29:06.326
Take it.

29:07.162 --> 29:08.662
Too loud!

29:26.765 --> 29:28.098
Adenike.

29:29.601 --> 29:30.809
Mami.

29:31.811 --> 29:33.812
It's chilly this morning.

29:35.523 --> 29:37.858
What a lunch you packed.

29:38.902 --> 29:40.152
Thank you.

29:40.236 --> 29:43.655
- He loves you doing this.
- I love to do it.

29:45.241 --> 29:50.078
You have been married
for quite some time.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.793
Have you been drinking my aloe?

29:55.877 --> 29:57.377
Yes.

29:59.422 --> 30:03.967
Well, God has a funny way
of dealing with these things.

30:05.220 --> 30:07.471
Many women have babies
in their 30s.

30:07.555 --> 30:09.389
But you haven't.

30:11.226 --> 30:15.813
My son worked hard to
bring you here.

30:15.897 --> 30:18.732
And he will always provide for you.

30:53.184 --> 30:56.353
Why are you letting her
ruin our lives?

30:56.855 --> 30:58.897
I'm not letting her do anything.

30:58.982 --> 31:00.691
- This is...
- You are.

31:00.775 --> 31:02.276
our decision.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.403
You will not take another woman?

31:05.238 --> 31:07.072
I don't want another woman.

31:08.741 --> 31:11.535
Are you going to tell your
mother that?

31:11.619 --> 31:14.121
Of course I will if she asks me.

31:39.939 --> 31:42.024
He lives here now, Ma.

31:50.366 --> 31:53.785
He doesn't want someone else.

32:05.673 --> 32:07.758
Ayo is not like that.

32:32.533 --> 32:34.660
Don't go!

32:39.374 --> 32:41.959
I'm talking to you and
you're trying to get up.

32:42.043 --> 32:44.169
This is not about your wife.

32:44.253 --> 32:47.381
This is about your child.

32:48.049 --> 32:49.299
Your unborn child.

32:51.260 --> 32:52.970
I have everything I want in life.

32:53.054 --> 32:54.388
No, you don't!

34:03.916 --> 34:06.084
Doctor's office.

34:06.169 --> 34:07.961
Yes.

34:09.589 --> 34:11.840
Can you spell that?

34:12.800 --> 34:14.384
Yes.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.053
Okay.

34:16.763 --> 34:18.597
Sarah?

34:21.851 --> 34:23.393
Yes.

34:24.853 --> 34:26.897
Can you hold on, please?

34:26.981 --> 34:28.732
Doctor's office.

34:53.216 --> 34:54.925
Excuse me.

34:55.009 --> 34:57.761
Our offices are closed now,
ma'am. Sorry.

34:59.722 --> 35:02.224
- The doctor... He...
- Has left.

35:03.184 --> 35:05.936
- Excuse me. Good night, Melissa.
- Good night, Karen.

35:06.020 --> 35:07.979
But I need to see him.

35:09.023 --> 35:11.274
I can, um,
put you on a waiting list.

35:11.359 --> 35:13.318
I cannot wait.

35:13.402 --> 35:15.529
I have to see him now.

35:15.613 --> 35:18.615
- I understand.
- No, you don't understand.

35:19.867 --> 35:21.701
It's been 18 months.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.204
No baby.

35:26.916 --> 35:29.793
Have you had any treatments?

35:29.877 --> 35:34.131
My mother-in-law's aloe
and, uh, some tea.

35:36.050 --> 35:40.053
Look. If you like, I can sit down
with you and your husband and...

35:40.138 --> 35:41.638
My husband?

35:45.476 --> 35:47.144
Hold on.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.220
- What the hell is this?
- Uh-uh! Come on now.

36:22.305 --> 36:24.264
What the fuck are you doing?
Huh?

36:24.348 --> 36:25.599
Uh-uh!

36:27.602 --> 36:29.686
Simple, eh? Simple.

36:32.356 --> 36:34.858
- AYO.
- Where were you today?

36:34.942 --> 36:37.110
- Is everything all right?
- Fine.

36:47.288 --> 36:49.623
We talk later.

36:49.707 --> 36:51.875
I'll be home later.
We talk. Okay?

37:50.518 --> 37:52.519
I went to the doctor today.

37:53.521 --> 37:55.021
What doctor?

37:56.065 --> 37:58.358
Fertility specialist.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.027
Sade knows him.

38:02.113 --> 38:05.240
Sade?
What is this, her business?

38:05.324 --> 38:07.492
He can help us, Ayo.

38:07.576 --> 38:11.162
She should get out of it.
Get her own husband.

38:11.247 --> 38:13.707
I'm not talking about Sade.

38:13.791 --> 38:16.293
I'm talking about us.

38:16.377 --> 38:18.753
The doctor can help us.

38:18.838 --> 38:21.881
He can run tests... everything.

38:23.175 --> 38:24.676
On me.

38:26.554 --> 38:28.054
And you.

38:30.933 --> 38:33.184
More than likely it is me.

39:14.268 --> 39:16.436
We can't afford this.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.480
We can take out a loan.

39:19.065 --> 39:21.524
Or ask my mother for some money.

39:24.153 --> 39:25.653
I'm tired.

39:26.822 --> 39:28.823
What do you mean you're...

39:57.395 --> 40:00.230
- What's this?
- Money, Ayo.

40:00.314 --> 40:02.232
Money I earned.

40:02.316 --> 40:04.901
I got a job. Cleaning.

40:05.778 --> 40:07.862
I thought it could help now.

40:07.947 --> 40:10.407
No wife of mine needs to clean.

40:10.491 --> 40:13.535
No. We can use the money.

40:13.619 --> 40:15.745
Every day I work hard so
you won't have to.

40:15.830 --> 40:18.915
It is a way to have what we want.

40:18.999 --> 40:21.835
With what? $200, $300?

40:28.092 --> 40:31.010
It's 500...

40:32.138 --> 40:34.013
and 47.

40:34.098 --> 40:36.015
It get us nothing!

40:36.100 --> 40:39.102
Didn't you see the prices
the doctor gave you?

40:40.688 --> 40:43.022
It can help us, Ayo!

40:43.107 --> 40:46.609
Please!

41:06.213 --> 41:07.630
Come.

41:12.970 --> 41:14.971
You know what will help?

41:51.759 --> 41:54.469
Please, trust me.

42:15.282 --> 42:16.950
But why?

42:17.034 --> 42:19.327
Why is it always the woman?

42:49.817 --> 42:51.484
Yeah.

44:31.418 --> 44:33.503
I don't understand why
you don't just tell him.

44:36.882 --> 44:39.175
And have him and my mom
down my throat?

44:39.259 --> 44:42.512
They're not going to be
down your throat.

44:42.596 --> 44:45.973
Babe, this is the one thing
in my life that...

44:46.058 --> 44:48.101
he's not involved in.

44:49.228 --> 44:51.270
And I'd like to keep it that way.

44:53.565 --> 44:55.358
Okay.

45:21.593 --> 45:24.345
Watch your step.
Watch your step. Watch your step.

45:28.600 --> 45:30.476
Watch your step.

45:58.088 --> 46:00.882
All right. Last stop,
everybody. Pass up a fin.

46:01.467 --> 46:03.009
Thanks.

46:03.093 --> 46:04.594
Thanks. Fin, fin.

46:04.678 --> 46:07.013
- Last stop.
- Okay.

46:52.684 --> 46:56.062
Okay.
Now, do you know Psalm 121?

46:56.146 --> 46:58.898
- Yeah.
- You need to recite it every day.

47:00.067 --> 47:02.151
- Okay.
- It'll be good for you.

47:02.236 --> 47:04.654
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

47:04.738 --> 47:06.656
Go ahead. You'll be fine.

47:07.574 --> 47:10.201
- You will be fine.
- Thank you.

47:12.913 --> 47:15.081
Take this with you.

47:16.208 --> 47:18.209
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

48:34.828 --> 48:36.996
You know how men are back home.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.877
He is not home.

48:53.472 --> 48:55.473
You know, I have to go.

48:56.308 --> 48:59.518
Nike.

49:02.856 --> 49:07.318
I have friends... who have adopted.

49:09.029 --> 49:12.073
I want it to be from me.

49:13.575 --> 49:14.659
How?

49:15.869 --> 49:19.872
How, if he will not go
to the doctor?

49:34.346 --> 49:35.673
Amen.

49:37.390 --> 49:38.746
Amen.

49:40.181 --> 49:41.569
Amen.

49:42.595 --> 49:43.957
Amen.

49:44.983 --> 49:46.157
Amen.

49:47.067 --> 49:49.276
As it is in heaven.

49:49.361 --> 49:53.114
Give us this day our daily bread...

49:53.198 --> 49:57.159
and forgive us all our trespasses...

49:57.244 --> 50:01.539
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

50:01.623 --> 50:04.166
And lead us not into temptation...

50:04.251 --> 50:05.918
but deliver us from all evil.

50:06.545 --> 50:08.504
For thine is the kingdom...

50:08.588 --> 50:10.506
the power and the glory...

50:10.590 --> 50:12.550
forever and ever. Amen.

50:12.634 --> 50:15.177
So you are blaming my son now.

50:15.262 --> 50:17.972
I'm not blaming anyone.

50:26.732 --> 50:28.649
- Adenike.
- Yeah?

50:29.234 --> 50:32.111
- Go home.
- Home?

50:32.988 --> 50:36.449
And give your husband your consent.

50:44.958 --> 50:46.917
What then?

50:50.130 --> 50:54.258
What happens when that woman
does not get pregnant?

50:54.342 --> 50:56.427
Or the next?

51:01.933 --> 51:04.977
Talk to Ayodele.
That is all I ask.

51:05.937 --> 51:09.231
- And say what?
- Get him to go to the doctor.

51:09.316 --> 51:11.275
He can help us.

51:18.909 --> 51:21.660
- You want to help Ayodele?
- Yes.

51:25.207 --> 51:27.166
You know what to do.

51:28.335 --> 51:31.670
Amen, amen, amen to Jesus.

51:34.091 --> 51:36.884
It's the same blood.

51:40.222 --> 51:44.683
Only a woman truly knows
who the father is.

51:50.649 --> 51:53.692
What?
To stick together as a family?

51:57.197 --> 51:59.740
Other women do it.

53:29.915 --> 53:31.457
Biyi.

53:33.960 --> 53:36.670
Did you get my messages?

53:40.342 --> 53:44.720
I called you and left messages
and you don't call me back.

53:54.314 --> 53:57.233
Your brother brought you here

53:57.859 --> 53:59.652
and has taken care of you.

54:01.488 --> 54:02.988
I'm talking to you!

54:24.052 --> 54:25.427
It is high time

54:25.512 --> 54:27.179
you did something for him.

54:28.181 --> 54:30.140
Get along now!

54:56.042 --> 54:58.043
I brought your brother's lunch.

54:59.379 --> 55:01.672
He's at the fish markets.

55:14.227 --> 55:16.228
I have to...

55:17.147 --> 55:18.605
Biyi.

55:19.607 --> 55:21.984
I need to talk to you.

55:22.068 --> 55:23.944
Not about the lunch.

55:24.029 --> 55:27.072
- I have to go and prep right now.
- No. Please.

55:27.699 --> 55:29.450
Please, please.

55:30.201 --> 55:32.369
It will not take long.

55:32.454 --> 55:33.996
I promise.

55:45.884 --> 55:47.801
You know...

55:49.929 --> 55:51.889
Your brother and I...

55:52.891 --> 55:55.059
We've been trying for long...

55:55.143 --> 55:57.644
for very long to have a baby.

55:59.731 --> 56:01.648
It might be me.

56:03.068 --> 56:04.818
But if it is not...

56:04.903 --> 56:07.279
then another woman does not make
sense, sure you understand.

56:07.364 --> 56:08.998
I have to go and do
some work in the kitchen.

56:09.024 --> 56:09.532
No!

56:16.706 --> 56:18.624
You know what this means to him.

56:18.708 --> 56:20.626
- I have to go inside...
- He is a good man.

56:20.710 --> 56:23.087
I have to go inside the kitchen.

56:23.171 --> 56:25.130
And you also.

56:26.549 --> 56:28.634
You are a good man.

56:30.637 --> 56:32.262
Please, eh?

56:32.347 --> 56:34.390
I do not know what else to do.

59:17.303 --> 59:19.513
What are you doing today?

59:19.597 --> 59:23.392
Oh, I'm...
just going shopping with Sade.

59:28.690 --> 59:30.857
Do you have money?

59:35.321 --> 59:37.239
Say hi.

01:04:40.918 --> 01:04:44.379
Whenever you want, I'll go
with you to the doctor.

01:05:31.636 --> 01:05:33.845
You know you wanna take the day.

01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:40.226
I had a day.

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:43.730
Hey!

01:05:43.814 --> 01:05:45.815
You have strong toes.

01:05:47.026 --> 01:05:49.444
That day was two weeks ago.

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:53.281
I'm lucky I even have a job.

01:06:20.893 --> 01:06:22.602
Hold on, hold on.

01:06:23.896 --> 01:06:25.271
Sorry.

01:06:25.856 --> 01:06:28.441
Hello? Hey.

01:06:33.906 --> 01:06:35.824
That's great.

01:06:35.908 --> 01:06:38.076
Oh, that's so great. Hold on.

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.245
Nike's pregnant.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.918
I'm so happy.

01:07:18.951 --> 01:07:20.660
Did you talk to my brother?

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:24.998
Why isn't he meeting us here?

01:08:49.707 --> 01:08:51.542
Thank you.

01:08:56.590 --> 01:08:58.550
Sorry I'm late.

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:02.595
Look who the cats dragged in.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:05.014
- Mami.
- Why you always late?

01:09:05.099 --> 01:09:07.142
I'm sorry.
It's not my fault.

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:11.895
- Congratulations!
- Oh, thank you.

01:09:12.689 --> 01:09:14.607
Congrats, mama.

01:09:14.692 --> 01:09:17.652
Oh, my God.
I'm so happy for you.

01:09:17.736 --> 01:09:19.904
- Thank you.
- So big already!

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:21.363
Hey!

01:09:21.448 --> 01:09:22.948
Hey, everybody!

01:09:28.788 --> 01:09:30.331
You are so funny.

01:09:33.544 --> 01:09:35.295
- Grab a seat.
- Ah, okay.

01:09:35.379 --> 01:09:38.381
Just bring this seat here.
Sit next to the mama.

01:09:41.426 --> 01:09:43.178
- You all right?
- Okay.

01:09:43.261 --> 01:09:44.929
Feels good, doesn't it?

01:09:51.103 --> 01:09:52.562
Shoot mama.

01:09:54.273 --> 01:09:56.441
You better don't shoot me.

01:09:57.109 --> 01:09:59.569
Beautiful, Mama. Beautiful.

01:10:01.739 --> 01:10:03.698
Adenike.

01:10:03.782 --> 01:10:07.285
So when is Babatunde going
to arrive?

01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:09.245
November 23.

01:10:10.247 --> 01:10:13.374
November 23?
Now we know...

01:10:13.459 --> 01:10:15.585
what lotto number
we supposed to play.

01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:17.795
Where is Biyi?

01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:23.301
- Make him come out.
- Biyi, Biyi, Biyi!

01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:25.094
Biyi, Biyi!

01:10:32.019 --> 01:10:34.437
- Let's make a toast.
- Hey, hey. One sec. One sec.

01:10:47.868 --> 01:10:51.037
You're supposed to wait for the baby
to come out before you do that.

01:10:51.121 --> 01:10:53.081
Well, we can have the party anytime.

01:10:53.165 --> 01:10:55.833
Now we know the baby gonna come.

01:10:59.046 --> 01:11:01.422
Well, well, well,
well, well, well.

01:11:01.507 --> 01:11:03.758
What a day this is, huh?

01:11:04.843 --> 01:11:06.970
Of God's making.

01:11:07.846 --> 01:11:11.015
To be blessed like this,
after so many years.

01:11:12.309 --> 01:11:15.228
I never got to see my father
before he died.

01:11:16.063 --> 01:11:20.441
But it is as if he is coming
back to me through Babatunde.

01:11:20.526 --> 01:11:22.443
- Amen.
- To my miracle!

01:11:35.416 --> 01:11:38.876
You know what? Get together.
Get together. Let's take a picture.

01:11:42.339 --> 01:11:44.632
Come, my miracle.

01:11:47.094 --> 01:11:49.387
Be in the middle.
Be there in the middle.

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:50.888
Come.

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:53.474
Ready?

01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:01.691
One more, one more,
one more, one more.

01:12:17.416 --> 01:12:23.629
My mama sat back. That means you
are accepted into the family.

01:13:37.329 --> 01:13:39.038
Coming.

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:45.920
- Where is Biyi?
- Biyi is not here.

01:13:46.004 --> 01:13:47.922
- Yes, but where is he?
- How do I know?

01:13:48.006 --> 01:13:50.341
- You married Biyi?
- No, I didn't marry...

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:52.427
- So work!
- I'm just working... I need Biyi.

01:13:52.511 --> 01:13:54.929
Forget about Biyi. You have
customers! You have customers!

01:13:55.013 --> 01:13:56.514
Don't yell at me.

01:14:02.479 --> 01:14:05.481
Monica. Here, here.

01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:11.571
Thank you.

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:32.383
Don't you know what I do here?

01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:06.417
So...

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:08.961
what's next?

01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:15.051
Where were you last night?

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:23.601
The sketch for the new cabinets.

01:15:27.606 --> 01:15:29.190
Good.

01:15:30.317 --> 01:15:33.319
You want to be part of
this business or not?

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:37.615
Sorry.
I forgot.

01:15:37.699 --> 01:15:39.617
Tunde didn't forget.

01:15:46.124 --> 01:15:49.460
Look. It's no big thing, okay?
I'm sorry.

01:15:51.296 --> 01:15:54.090
Next time it's no big thing,
tell me.

01:15:54.591 --> 01:15:58.302
That way I won't keep waiting for
someone who isn't going to show.

01:16:00.472 --> 01:16:02.515
When are you gonna grow up?

01:16:08.605 --> 01:16:11.023
You know how much
those chicken breasts cost me?

01:16:12.484 --> 01:16:13.985
Every night it's something.

01:16:14.987 --> 01:16:16.737
Three nights ago...

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:19.115
he overcooked three
of the specials.

01:16:19.199 --> 01:16:21.033
It's okay, it's okay.

01:16:21.118 --> 01:16:23.786
And then he burned the
Joloff rice.

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:27.248
I don't know what's
been eating him...

01:16:27.332 --> 01:16:29.500
but whatever it is,
I'm sick of it.

01:16:30.377 --> 01:16:32.545
How does he expect to be partners...

01:16:32.629 --> 01:16:35.590
if he is not holding up
his end of the bargain?

01:16:35.674 --> 01:16:37.758
Maybe he's just tired.

01:16:37.843 --> 01:16:40.011
You know he likes to stay out.

01:16:40.554 --> 01:16:42.597
Tell him he shouldn't stay out.

01:16:42.681 --> 01:16:44.432
He's not a kid anymore.

01:16:46.393 --> 01:16:47.935
I'll get it.

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:50.021
Hello?

01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:53.816
Uh, my address?

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:55.192
Sure.

01:16:55.986 --> 01:16:58.029
Well, okay.

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:05.870
All right. Thanks.

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:42.406
He's right.

01:17:43.408 --> 01:17:46.035
I should leave,
go somewhere else.

01:17:46.119 --> 01:17:48.496
- Where?
- I...

01:17:50.123 --> 01:17:52.083
I don't know.

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:54.251
You have a life here.

01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:58.172
What life?

01:17:58.799 --> 01:18:02.760
I go to sleep, wake up,
piss thinking about it.

01:18:03.553 --> 01:18:05.638
And it's only going to get worse.

01:18:06.556 --> 01:18:08.974
It is what he wanted, Biyi.

01:18:09.059 --> 01:18:11.352
What he wanted...
to be lied to day after day?

01:18:11.436 --> 01:18:14.980
I don't think so. I can't do it.
Maybe you can, but I...

01:18:15.065 --> 01:18:16.704
You what?

01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:23.389
You what?

01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:30.830
I want it over with.

01:18:35.085 --> 01:18:37.086
What are you saying?

01:18:55.355 --> 01:18:57.481
What are you saying, Biyi?

01:19:11.663 --> 01:19:14.248
Just tell him.
Just let him know.

01:19:17.043 --> 01:19:18.544
You can't!

01:19:19.254 --> 01:19:22.339
You can never do that!

01:20:21.942 --> 01:20:24.401
Are you teaching him burping?

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:26.570
Do not waste time.

01:20:32.994 --> 01:20:34.995
Somebody is selling a used car,

01:20:36.414 --> 01:20:38.457
I know you need a car.

01:20:41.419 --> 01:20:43.754
The car we bought last
year still works,

01:20:45.757 --> 01:20:48.509
maybe when business picks up.

01:21:25.630 --> 01:21:27.464
This is a boy.

01:21:42.647 --> 01:21:44.732
So what do you think, Son?

01:21:45.817 --> 01:21:47.902
Are your feet ticklish?

01:21:50.322 --> 01:21:52.323
What about your hands?

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:56.535
Will you have mine,
or your mama's?

01:22:04.544 --> 01:22:06.795
And about your teeth, eh?

01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:08.839
You want your father's?

01:22:10.425 --> 01:22:12.551
See how bright they are?

01:22:12.636 --> 01:22:13.844
And strong.

01:22:14.888 --> 01:22:16.513
Only two cavities.

01:22:21.144 --> 01:22:23.020
To tell you the truth...

01:22:23.104 --> 01:22:25.898
whatever you look like
will be perfect.

01:22:25.982 --> 01:22:27.983
As long as you have my teeth.

01:22:30.987 --> 01:22:32.488
What?

01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:35.115
Is it about earlier?

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:37.368
I know I went off, but...

01:23:00.517 --> 01:23:02.017
What's wrong?

01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:18.951
Ayo.

01:23:19.035 --> 01:23:20.411
What?

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:27.126
Biyi.

01:23:27.711 --> 01:23:29.420
He what?

01:23:33.091 --> 01:23:34.633
The baby.

01:23:36.136 --> 01:23:37.886
Biyi is the father.

01:23:38.722 --> 01:23:40.806
Stop talking rubbish.

01:23:40.890 --> 01:23:42.516
It's not.

01:23:43.101 --> 01:23:44.643
Your mother...

01:23:44.728 --> 01:23:46.145
My...

01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:49.273
My mama what?

01:23:58.825 --> 01:24:01.452
It's the same blood.

01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:08.959
It's not fucking okay for me to take
another woman, but it's okay for you?

01:24:09.044 --> 01:24:10.669
It's not the same.

01:24:10.754 --> 01:24:12.921
Biyi would never, ever...

01:24:13.006 --> 01:24:14.882
replace you in our marriage.

01:24:23.308 --> 01:24:25.225
You did! Ayo.

01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:27.644
We both did.

01:24:29.314 --> 01:24:31.732
Where are you going?

01:24:31.816 --> 01:24:33.358
Ayo!

01:25:04.516 --> 01:25:07.684
Where did it happen?
Where did it happen?

01:25:07.769 --> 01:25:08.977
Hello, darling.

01:25:09.062 --> 01:25:11.021
I said, where did it happen?

01:25:14.692 --> 01:25:16.443
Is it me you are yelling at?

01:25:18.196 --> 01:25:19.696
Is there no more respect at all?

01:25:21.241 --> 01:25:22.741
I am still your mother.

01:25:27.205 --> 01:25:29.706
Did it happen in your
bed or mine?

01:25:32.043 --> 01:25:33.293
How's your wife?

01:25:36.297 --> 01:25:37.172
A child...

01:25:37.257 --> 01:25:39.550
a child belongs to us all.

01:25:40.552 --> 01:25:42.553
It doesn't matter who
the father is...

01:25:42.637 --> 01:25:44.596
It does matter to me!

01:25:50.478 --> 01:25:53.313
You know it is you they are
going to call the father.

01:25:53.398 --> 01:25:54.857
No, Biyi is the father!

01:25:54.941 --> 01:25:57.818
At least admit what happened...
what you made happen.

01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:01.822
I don't want to disrupt your house.

01:26:02.115 --> 01:26:02.823
Which house?

01:26:02.907 --> 01:26:05.707
It is not only my house you have
disrupted. You have disrupted my mind.

01:26:06.452 --> 01:26:09.580
No more marriage.
I'm walking out.

01:26:10.832 --> 01:26:12.666
What do you want everyone
to think?

01:26:13.042 --> 01:26:14.960
Yes! All the better!

01:26:15.044 --> 01:26:17.421
Let them know who she is,
what she has done.

01:26:21.593 --> 01:26:23.302
What good will that do?

01:26:23.928 --> 01:26:26.263
Do you want everyone to know
what is going on?

01:26:26.764 --> 01:26:27.514
In your room?

01:26:27.599 --> 01:26:28.724
In your bed?

01:26:29.475 --> 01:26:32.936
Let this be between
you and your wife.

01:26:35.607 --> 01:26:37.107
This woman loves you.

01:26:38.318 --> 01:26:39.860
She loves you dearly.

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:44.114
That is the honest truth.

01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:29.826
Okay, okay, okay.

01:27:35.875 --> 01:27:37.834
What is it?

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:44.925
He walked out.

01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:53.100
What do you mean he walked out?

01:28:03.069 --> 01:28:04.861
Okay, okay, okay.

01:28:18.543 --> 01:28:20.294
Okay, come.

01:28:28.011 --> 01:28:29.928
Honey, are you...

01:28:41.941 --> 01:28:44.901
Okay... Nike, wait.

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:05.255
You know,
you talk a lot of shit.

01:29:08.176 --> 01:29:10.761
About wanting a different life.

01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:17.059
Then you go and do this.

01:29:20.271 --> 01:29:22.647
You could have refused.

01:29:24.734 --> 01:29:27.652
You could have talked to me.

01:29:28.946 --> 01:29:32.032
Told me what the fuck
was going on.

01:29:32.116 --> 01:29:35.285
- Showed me that you gave a shit.
- I do.

01:29:39.999 --> 01:29:42.125
You don't have a mind of your own.

01:29:45.004 --> 01:29:47.631
He's my brother.
What can I tell you?

01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:56.473
Wow.

01:29:57.392 --> 01:29:59.309
You don't get it, do you?

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:04.106
Get what?

01:30:09.654 --> 01:30:11.571
He's my brother.

01:30:31.008 --> 01:30:33.488
What the fuck is wrong with your head?
Don't you think with it?

01:30:34.303 --> 01:30:36.388
I want you to get another job.

01:30:36.472 --> 01:30:38.881
I don't give a shit
what it is or where you

01:30:38.907 --> 01:30:41.042
go as long as you
stay out of my life.

01:30:56.909 --> 01:30:59.619
What made you tell your husband?

01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:04.249
You should not have told him.

01:31:22.018 --> 01:31:24.227
I couldn't live like that.

01:31:56.928 --> 01:31:58.542
Ayo!

01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:05.852
Ayo!

01:32:15.046 --> 01:32:16.796
Ayo!

01:32:18.574 --> 01:32:20.367
Don't do this.

01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:25.497
You made me into a fool...
all of you!

01:32:25.581 --> 01:32:28.583
No, Ayo, please.

01:32:28.668 --> 01:32:33.797
Ayo, I didn't know what else...
It was out of love!

01:32:34.298 --> 01:32:36.591
Why else would I...

01:32:36.676 --> 01:32:39.302
My whole life has been
about pleasing you.

01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:41.137
Giving you what you wanted.

01:32:41.889 --> 01:32:44.558
What I wanted was for you
to be my wife, no one else's!

01:32:44.642 --> 01:32:46.810
I'm still your wife!

01:32:46.894 --> 01:32:50.146
I am still your wife!

01:35:17.962 --> 01:35:19.671
Ayo?

01:35:34.645 --> 01:35:36.104
Ayodele?

01:35:37.148 --> 01:35:39.315
I know you are in there.

01:35:53.497 --> 01:35:54.998
Nike.

01:36:06.719 --> 01:36:08.178
Ayo.

01:36:09.764 --> 01:36:11.473
Please.

01:36:12.683 --> 01:36:14.309
Don't say no.

01:36:44.882 --> 01:36:47.091
If you want it...

01:36:55.810 --> 01:36:57.560
Please.

01:36:58.896 --> 01:37:02.398
Just come with me to the
airport to pick up Mama.

01:37:04.944 --> 01:37:08.279
She knows nothing, Ayo.

01:37:09.907 --> 01:37:11.074
Nothing.

01:37:44.191 --> 01:37:45.275
Ayo.

01:39:28.003 --> 01:39:29.921
Tell me your name now.

01:39:31.882 --> 01:39:33.716
It's okay.
Take your time.

01:39:35.177 --> 01:39:36.219
Adenike.

01:39:36.303 --> 01:39:38.471
Adenike?
That's beautiful.

01:39:38.555 --> 01:39:41.182
Adenike,
my name is Dr. Greene, okay?

01:39:43.602 --> 01:39:45.603
You're gonna be fine.

01:39:46.814 --> 01:39:48.523
It's okay.

01:39:53.445 --> 01:39:55.405
You're gonna be fine.

01:40:41.410 --> 01:40:42.660
Dr. Greene.

01:40:43.746 --> 01:40:45.747
I'm gonna take you back
with me, okay?

01:42:32.646 --> 01:42:35.648
