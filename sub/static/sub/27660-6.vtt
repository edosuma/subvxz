00:06.220 --> 00:07.639
Previously
on "Future Man"...

00:07.640 --> 00:08.891
Filthy Strays!

00:09.894 --> 00:11.270
A rock to the face!

00:11.271 --> 00:12.607
Why are you smiling, Binx?

00:12.608 --> 00:14.819
This pain is the price
of freedom.

00:14.820 --> 00:16.447
Wolf and I are lucky
that we're even alive.

00:16.448 --> 00:19.996
- Wolf?
- What's, uh, her deal?

00:19.997 --> 00:21.332
You're into her.

00:21.333 --> 00:22.417
I am not.

00:22.418 --> 00:23.504
You just wanna stick your

00:23.505 --> 00:25.591
ghost dick in my time twin?

00:27.220 --> 00:28.555
When you get to the NAG,
you're--you're gonna see

00:28.556 --> 00:30.267
how much better it is.

00:30.268 --> 00:32.104
We didn't sacrifice everyone
and everything to settle

00:32.105 --> 00:33.774
for a second-rate future.

00:33.775 --> 00:35.611
You hijacked my brain
just to ask me questions

00:35.612 --> 00:37.239
about Stu Camillo?

00:37.240 --> 00:39.410
Yes, but the simulation
told us so much more.

00:39.411 --> 00:41.122
I was kidnapped
by time terrorists.

00:41.123 --> 00:42.792
They're gonna start a war.
I'm scared.

00:42.793 --> 00:44.879
Dr. Eunice Hogeveen?

01:04.044 --> 01:07.842
Where's my TTD,
you fucking dick scab?

01:25.712 --> 01:28.842
- Stray!
- Strays amongst the wheels!

01:28.843 --> 01:32.182
Stray!
Filthy, dirty Stray!

01:32.183 --> 01:34.353
Filthy, dirty Stray!

01:43.623 --> 01:45.375
Hey, Torque!

01:45.376 --> 01:47.337
I heard my bean cake
was a real hit

01:47.338 --> 01:48.632
at the Wheelmaker home.

01:48.633 --> 01:51.596
- Oh, yeah.
- It was, Funnel.

01:51.597 --> 01:54.227
Well, there's more
where that came from.

01:58.695 --> 02:00.363
His face hurts.

02:00.364 --> 02:01.825
And where is his glasses?

02:01.826 --> 02:03.704
He can't see
without his glasses.

02:03.705 --> 02:06.835
Put his glasses on.

02:06.836 --> 02:08.755
- Put on his glasses.
- This again, huh?

02:08.756 --> 02:10.968
He can't see
without his glasses.

02:10.969 --> 02:12.345
He was gonna be
an acrobat.

02:12.346 --> 02:13.932
Come on, Dad.

02:13.933 --> 02:15.686
Don't you think this
is a little bit much?

02:15.687 --> 02:17.565
You don't have to feel
this way.

02:17.566 --> 02:20.946
What, I should just delete
her from my memory banks?

02:20.947 --> 02:23.619
Just flip a switch
and Tiger's gone forever?

02:23.620 --> 02:25.413
Yep, yep, you have
the power to do that.

02:25.414 --> 02:27.543
So you're choosing
to make yourself

02:27.544 --> 02:30.298
and everyone else miserable.

02:30.299 --> 02:33.722
Dr. Ahmadi says that real men
go through the pain.

02:33.723 --> 02:39.609
Oh, okay, so, um, you--
you're a pretend man.

02:39.610 --> 02:42.239
And she's a pretend therapist.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.992
Real men go through the pain.

02:43.993 --> 02:47.625
So I know that it was
really bad when it was just

02:47.626 --> 02:50.548
the two of us,
but it was way worse

02:50.549 --> 02:52.384
when Tiger was here.

02:52.385 --> 02:56.560
So now we can just go back
to just normal bad.

02:56.561 --> 02:57.895
What do you say?

02:57.896 --> 02:59.356
- Yes!
- Oh, oh!

02:59.357 --> 03:01.068
- She's back!
- Oh, okay.

03:01.069 --> 03:02.362
- Oh, God.
- Look at this place.

03:02.363 --> 03:04.158
I can't let her
see me like this.

03:05.160 --> 03:07.582
No, Dad!

03:07.583 --> 03:09.334
Don't do this.

03:09.335 --> 03:12.340
She's the worst, and she
brings out the worst in you.

03:12.341 --> 03:13.969
- I don't care.
- You, out.

03:13.970 --> 03:16.181
You, turn your cameras on.
I wanna spy on everyone.

03:26.787 --> 03:28.665
I can still smell Stray.

03:28.666 --> 03:31.337
- What's going on?
- Huh?

03:31.338 --> 03:33.299
I was attacked by
a filthy Stray I found

03:33.300 --> 03:35.178
contaminating the wheels
this morning.

03:35.179 --> 03:37.015
- Stray, huh?
- Oh, wow.

03:37.016 --> 03:38.852
Sounds like you've had
a tough morning.

03:38.853 --> 03:42.359
Uh, where--where is that
filthy Stray, anyway?

03:42.360 --> 03:43.655
I gonged for ISE.

03:45.199 --> 03:47.536
Internal Stray Enforcement?

03:47.537 --> 03:49.456
They brought him
to the Smash Pit.

03:49.457 --> 03:52.420
Far better than those
spindly grinks deserve.

03:52.421 --> 03:54.383
What did they do to earn
such cushy lives?

03:54.384 --> 03:55.761
- Cushy, huh?
- Yeah.

03:55.762 --> 03:57.848
If it were up to me,
we'd just execute

03:57.849 --> 03:59.393
all the outsiders.

03:59.394 --> 04:01.648
Yeah, I'm familiar with
your position on others.

04:01.649 --> 04:04.111
But the NAG's got
bigger problems.

04:04.112 --> 04:05.948
Problems that might make
some people call this place

04:05.949 --> 04:06.991
second rate.

04:06.992 --> 04:08.411
Who would say that?

04:08.412 --> 04:10.039
Also, what does that mean?

04:10.040 --> 04:11.918
It means little things
like people being tortured

04:11.919 --> 04:13.129
for the way they lean...

04:13.130 --> 04:14.799
Don't lean weird.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.553
Or how people defecate
wherever they please...

04:16.554 --> 04:17.805
You want them to hold it in?

04:17.806 --> 04:20.561
Or how a wheel
costs one chit...

04:20.562 --> 04:23.149
but so does a house

04:23.150 --> 04:24.484
or a button.

04:24.485 --> 04:26.823
All part of Vise's
master plan.

04:26.824 --> 04:28.200
Vise?

04:28.201 --> 04:29.746
Supreme Overlord of the NAG.

04:29.747 --> 04:31.666
We don't see him much anymore.

04:31.667 --> 04:33.377
He designed this whole place.

04:33.378 --> 04:36.760
So how does a guy
talk to this Vise?

04:36.761 --> 04:39.766
Oh, you can't just
talk to Vise.

04:39.767 --> 04:43.230
You have to wait until a scroll
sealed with red wax

04:43.231 --> 04:46.278
appears on your door
summoning you for a visitation.

04:46.279 --> 04:48.157
Right.

04:48.158 --> 04:50.078
But where's his house?

04:59.097 --> 05:00.891
I-I didn't do anything wrong.

05:00.892 --> 05:02.728
I-I was just sleeping
on my friend's floor.

05:02.729 --> 05:05.859
Strays are forbidden from
making lasting friendships.

05:05.860 --> 05:07.822
- What?
- And humming.

05:07.823 --> 05:10.869
Wh-why is everybody
smashing things?

05:10.870 --> 05:13.499
Technology has been used
to murder and oppress

05:13.500 --> 05:15.253
my people for generations.

05:15.254 --> 05:16.589
It's just a harmless
panini press.

05:19.053 --> 05:20.597
Not anymore.

05:20.598 --> 05:22.183
- Jesus.
- You see,

05:22.184 --> 05:24.312
it is a tech-free
building material.

05:24.313 --> 05:26.693
You will come to understand
in about five years--

05:26.694 --> 05:28.320
- Five years?
- Yeah, no.

05:28.321 --> 05:32.120
Whoa, this--this is very wrong.
I am not a Stray.

05:32.121 --> 05:33.957
- Right.
- You're--you're a Smasher now.

05:33.958 --> 05:36.629
- No.
- No, not a Smasher either.

05:36.630 --> 05:38.717
Uh, I'm just here visiting
my friend Torque.

05:38.718 --> 05:40.261
- Oh.
- You may have heard of Torque.

05:40.262 --> 05:41.639
We can just go in town,
clear all this up.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.727
You're friends with Torque?

05:43.728 --> 05:46.315
Maker of Wheels,
Father of Wagons.

05:46.316 --> 05:48.653
- Uh, yeah, yeah.
- What, do you know him?

05:50.575 --> 05:53.663
Well enough to know that he
would never associate himself

05:53.664 --> 05:55.626
with a low-life Stray.

05:55.627 --> 05:57.003
Smash everything
in this pile

05:57.004 --> 05:58.465
before the sun
hits the third hole.

06:02.515 --> 06:04.142
What?

06:04.143 --> 06:05.979
Wait, before the sun hits
the third hole of what?

06:05.980 --> 06:08.860
Is that, like, a lot of time
or... a little?

06:08.861 --> 06:10.322
Shit.

06:11.659 --> 06:13.620
What the fuck?

06:13.621 --> 06:15.414
Binx?

06:15.415 --> 06:17.753
Oh, my God.
Binx, is that you?

06:17.754 --> 06:19.089
Oh, my God.

06:19.090 --> 06:21.093
I'm so happy to see
a familiar face.

06:21.094 --> 06:23.264
Oh, oh!

06:23.265 --> 06:25.561
I should never
have come here.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.879
General Vise, sir?

06:59.880 --> 07:01.632
Hello?

07:01.633 --> 07:03.928
Stop gawking and come inside.

07:10.526 --> 07:13.405
Torque Wheelmaker.

07:13.406 --> 07:16.119
The man who came back
from the dead.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.956
It's an honor, sir.

07:17.957 --> 07:22.674
Your eyes sing to me of pain.

07:22.675 --> 07:24.219
I think it's just
dark in here.

07:24.220 --> 07:28.143
Don't deny
your suffering, son.

07:28.144 --> 07:31.859
I know of the shadows
that cling to the soul

07:31.860 --> 07:34.532
after crossing
the threshold of hell.

07:34.533 --> 07:36.702
That will change a man.

07:36.703 --> 07:39.332
Change is actually what
I came to talk to you about.

07:39.333 --> 07:44.635
Ah, the impatience
of the young.

07:44.636 --> 07:47.265
Down to business, are we?

07:47.266 --> 07:51.064
Come into my workshop.
I want to know you.

07:55.365 --> 07:59.999
You might have noticed
a few of my curios.

08:02.630 --> 08:06.178
Pardon an old man his passions.

08:06.179 --> 08:09.602
They're ghosts
of an age long past.

08:09.603 --> 08:11.062
As am I.

08:11.063 --> 08:12.900
No, your wisdom,
to say nothing

08:12.901 --> 08:15.154
of your design aesthetic,
is impressive.

08:15.155 --> 08:18.368
I like the reminder
of what was

08:18.369 --> 08:22.418
and is and will be

08:22.419 --> 08:25.382
and wasn't and weren't.

08:25.383 --> 08:29.808
And animals.
I liked animals.

08:29.809 --> 08:33.775
Ah, that's exactly what I'd
expect from the wise architect

08:33.776 --> 08:35.654
of this great NAG.

08:35.655 --> 08:38.283
- But you have complaints.
- Well, um...

08:38.284 --> 08:41.456
They always have complaints.

08:41.457 --> 08:43.460
Not complaints exactly.

08:43.461 --> 08:46.174
Just constructive questions.

08:46.175 --> 08:47.594
Oh.

08:47.595 --> 08:49.013
The kind
that make us all better,

08:49.014 --> 08:51.434
little things:
the justice system,

08:51.435 --> 08:52.938
chit deflation,

08:52.939 --> 08:55.359
the whole
street-shitting thing.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.446
Do you know what makes
a community thrive,

08:57.447 --> 08:59.284
young Wheelmaker?

08:59.285 --> 09:01.622
A fiscal system that rewards
different levels of effort

09:01.623 --> 09:02.749
with different levels of pay?

09:02.750 --> 09:04.628
Ah, nonsense.

09:04.629 --> 09:08.385
The last thing this place needs
is a cohesive set of rules.

09:08.386 --> 09:11.391
Rules make people believe
the world can be understood.

09:11.392 --> 09:14.105
It can't.
It's chaos.

09:14.106 --> 09:17.069
That's why I crafted this NAG.

09:17.070 --> 09:22.204
To be a reminder
that logic is a trap.

09:22.205 --> 09:24.208
Um...

09:24.209 --> 09:26.379
Oh.
Oh, is that a--

09:26.380 --> 09:27.924
is that a myrm?

09:27.925 --> 09:30.889
Oh, good eye, my child.

09:30.890 --> 09:35.523
Yes, it was a gift from
the Bio-Tech Necro-Hangar.

09:35.524 --> 09:40.909
And you of all people should
understand what mares of night

09:40.910 --> 09:42.913
gallop the depths.

09:42.914 --> 09:45.000
You--you survived a myrm?

09:45.001 --> 09:47.088
No, once they're in your skull,
they don't leave

09:47.089 --> 09:48.298
until it's empty.

09:48.299 --> 09:50.845
Oh, they do.

09:50.846 --> 09:56.732
If you're willing
to cut out half your brain.

09:56.733 --> 09:59.863
Wait, so--so you
came up with all this

09:59.864 --> 10:01.408
using only half a brain?

10:01.409 --> 10:05.542
Ah, the impatience
of the young.

10:05.543 --> 10:07.838
Down to business, are we?

10:07.839 --> 10:09.842
Come into my workshop.

10:09.843 --> 10:12.681
I want to know you.

10:12.682 --> 10:15.603
Okay, this explains a lot.

10:15.604 --> 10:19.360
Um, look, maybe if you just
come down into the streets--

10:19.361 --> 10:23.160
Oh, I'll meet you
in the streets.

10:23.161 --> 10:25.832
- What?
- Challenge accepted.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.961
Oh.

10:27.962 --> 10:29.046
Ah.

10:29.047 --> 10:30.592
We de-bat tomorrow

10:30.593 --> 10:32.721
when the moon hits
the fifth hole.

10:32.722 --> 10:34.725
- Wait, General Vise, wait.
- That's not what I meant.

10:36.605 --> 10:38.273
Ah.

10:48.377 --> 10:51.049
You challenged Vise
to a de-bat?

10:51.050 --> 10:52.301
Are you trying
to say "debate?"

10:52.302 --> 10:54.347
- You say debate.
- I say de-bat.

10:54.348 --> 10:57.353
- You just got back.
- You got sand brain.

10:57.354 --> 10:59.023
Do you really think
you're qualified?

10:59.024 --> 11:00.317
Oh, yeah, sure.

11:00.318 --> 11:02.154
I-I'll do the de-bat.

11:02.155 --> 11:04.492
Air out my grievances,
then he has to take

11:04.493 --> 11:06.580
my suggestions,
fix up the NAG.

11:06.581 --> 11:08.291
No, whoever wins the de-bat

11:08.292 --> 11:11.047
becomes the new
Supreme Overlord.

11:11.048 --> 11:12.926
Hmm.

11:12.927 --> 11:15.472
Well, yeah, that works too.

11:15.473 --> 11:17.184
Hmm.

11:17.185 --> 11:18.688
Ah.

11:18.689 --> 11:19.898
But they are trying to kill you.

11:19.899 --> 11:21.401
Just because you have power,

11:21.402 --> 11:22.988
it doesn't mean
you should abuse it.

11:22.989 --> 11:24.575
It's an invasion of privacy.

11:24.576 --> 11:26.411
Hey, so I guess nothing
ever happened

11:26.412 --> 11:27.873
with that Rolf guy, huh?

11:27.874 --> 11:29.125
Rolf is not what's
important here.

11:29.126 --> 11:30.712
Yeah.

11:30.713 --> 11:32.131
I need access to all
your security footage.

11:32.132 --> 11:34.218
You know, to keep you safe.

11:35.639 --> 11:38.226
I-I'm touched that you care,
Tiger.

11:38.227 --> 11:42.443
When you disappeared, I, uh--
I was in a really dark place.

11:42.444 --> 11:45.240
Okay, this should be
bringing you to a dark place.

11:45.241 --> 11:46.869
Why are you not more concerned?

11:46.870 --> 11:48.706
I think, after the first
few terrorist plots,

11:48.707 --> 11:52.129
I was concerned, but
my security is impenetrable.

11:52.130 --> 11:54.133
I would hunt down
and eliminate the leaders

11:54.134 --> 11:56.429
of these groups
with extreme prejudice.

11:56.430 --> 11:58.433
I once read a long-winded
torture manual

11:58.434 --> 12:01.982
where they nailed a sand wizard
to a wooden T.

12:01.983 --> 12:03.068
Th-the Bible?

12:03.069 --> 12:04.529
Mm-mm-mm.

12:04.530 --> 12:06.533
None of that is necessary.

12:06.534 --> 12:08.286
This Achilles is not a threat.

12:08.287 --> 12:09.706
So you know of Achilles?

12:09.707 --> 12:11.627
There probably
isn't even an Achilles.

12:11.628 --> 12:15.133
These groups rely on mythology,
in this case very literally.

12:15.134 --> 12:17.054
The Pointed Circle
is different.

12:17.055 --> 12:19.433
Athena was operating this whole
time right under your nose.

12:19.434 --> 12:22.106
No, no, that one stings.

12:22.107 --> 12:23.693
Who could have guessed
that the live-in doctor

12:23.694 --> 12:25.487
would turn out to be so shady?

12:25.488 --> 12:27.826
We need to fire up every
peeper box in every hab unit

12:27.827 --> 12:28.911
in the Mons.

12:28.912 --> 12:30.748
We are at war, Stu.

12:30.749 --> 12:32.544
Do you think the terrorists
are afraid to watch people

12:32.545 --> 12:33.713
pee in the shower?

12:33.714 --> 12:35.215
- I'm not afraid.
- It's just--

12:35.216 --> 12:36.384
It's a line I swore
I would never cross.

12:36.385 --> 12:37.721
Fine, fine.

12:37.722 --> 12:39.098
Then this is a waste
of my time.

12:39.099 --> 12:42.479
I came back here
because I care about you

12:42.480 --> 12:43.899
and our friendship.

12:43.900 --> 12:45.444
You know what?
I'll just, uh--

12:45.445 --> 12:47.364
I'll head out.
I'll do this on my own.

12:47.365 --> 12:50.287
And maybe you'll see me again.

12:50.288 --> 12:51.957
But you probably won't.

12:51.958 --> 12:53.502
Yeah, you know what?
You won't.

12:53.503 --> 12:55.338
Yeah, I can guarantee
you probably won't.

12:55.339 --> 12:56.633
Would this be helpful?

13:00.391 --> 13:02.478
Helpful?

13:02.479 --> 13:05.317
That--that--that
is fucking beautiful.

13:05.318 --> 13:06.612
Yeah.

13:06.613 --> 13:08.114
We need to run
facial recognition

13:08.115 --> 13:09.785
on Eunice Hogeveen
and all known associates.

13:09.786 --> 13:11.580
I want archived footage
going back two years.

13:11.581 --> 13:13.667
I want every conversation,
interaction,

13:13.668 --> 13:15.838
covert walk,
sneaky talk.

13:15.839 --> 13:17.926
This is an extremely
dangerous place to work.

13:17.927 --> 13:19.930
Half the people down there
have lockjaw from the tetanus.

13:19.931 --> 13:21.474
Except they don't even
call it lockjaw.

13:21.475 --> 13:22.769
They call it Smash Mouth.

13:22.770 --> 13:24.355
Smash Mouth!

13:24.356 --> 13:26.067
And they don't even get
why that's so funny.

13:26.068 --> 13:27.946
- I know.
- I don't either.

13:27.947 --> 13:31.119
Look, we've all got problems.
Cluster's all over my case.

13:31.120 --> 13:34.291
And I guess now I'm running for
Supreme Overlord or something.

13:34.292 --> 13:35.837
You need to get me
out of here, all right?

13:35.838 --> 13:37.841
Tiger was right.
This place fucking sucks.

13:37.842 --> 13:39.594
No, Tiger's not right.

13:39.595 --> 13:42.684
Sure, right now, the NAG
is a big, slimy caterpillar.

13:42.685 --> 13:45.940
But do you know...

13:45.941 --> 13:47.569
do you know
what caterpillars turn into?

13:47.570 --> 13:48.571
- Yeah, of course.
- They turn into--

13:48.572 --> 13:50.490
Birds.

13:50.491 --> 13:53.873
Yeah, they just need a little
help out of their chrysalis--

13:53.874 --> 13:56.336
egg or--I don't know.

13:57.422 --> 13:58.507
I lost the thread.

13:58.508 --> 14:00.636
Hey, I-I need your help.

14:00.637 --> 14:02.515
- Help me.
- All right, listen.

14:02.516 --> 14:04.978
- The ship of state turns slowly.
- Oh, my God.

14:04.979 --> 14:07.609
Once I'm Supreme Overlord,
you better believe I'm gonna

14:07.610 --> 14:09.486
put Stray Reform on the agenda.

14:09.487 --> 14:11.700
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.

14:11.701 --> 14:13.328
It's a loser at the polls.

14:13.329 --> 14:14.664
Wolf, listen to me.

14:14.665 --> 14:16.375
Binx, he was in here
for one day.

14:16.376 --> 14:19.006
He lost his eye, all hope,
and now he's called Winx.

14:19.007 --> 14:20.133
When he cries, blood comes out.

14:20.134 --> 14:21.218
And he's crying all the time.

14:21.219 --> 14:22.471
I can't be in here anymore.

14:22.472 --> 14:24.391
- Come on.
- It's not that bad.

14:24.392 --> 14:26.730
You're J1, right? J1.

14:26.731 --> 14:28.525
You're telling me J1
can't handle a day or two

14:28.526 --> 14:30.863
- of smash action?
- J1 can handle smash action.

14:30.864 --> 14:32.282
What I'm saying is that
I'm a little concerned

14:32.283 --> 14:33.535
about the terrorists.
Remember them?

14:33.536 --> 14:34.996
The ones that tried to kill me,

14:34.997 --> 14:36.833
now are trying
to kill everybody else?

14:36.834 --> 14:38.378
The Pointed Circle, Athena,
this guy Achilles? Come on!

14:38.379 --> 14:40.048
Yeah, none of those yahoos
are in the NAG,

14:40.049 --> 14:41.677
- so you're safe here.
- But that's not the point.

14:41.678 --> 14:43.555
The point is, I shouldn't
even be in this place.

14:43.556 --> 14:44.933
I should be out there with you

14:44.934 --> 14:46.435
trying to succeed
on this mission.

14:46.436 --> 14:48.649
Okay, look,
once I'm Supreme Overlord,

14:48.650 --> 14:50.276
I will work to get you
out of the pit.

14:50.277 --> 14:53.408
Maybe throw a patronage
appointment your way.

14:53.409 --> 14:56.080
How does Deputy Director
of Stray Affairs sound?

14:57.333 --> 14:59.044
Not as good as Director.

14:59.045 --> 15:00.923
All right.

15:00.924 --> 15:02.802
- Wolf, are you serious?
- Deputy.

15:02.803 --> 15:04.597
You just stay here.

15:06.101 --> 15:07.562
You're just gonna
leave me here alone?

15:07.563 --> 15:08.897
Don't leave.

15:08.898 --> 15:09.983
Please don't leave.

15:09.984 --> 15:11.778
You're being a dick to me!

15:24.889 --> 15:26.684
Ah!

15:51.567 --> 15:53.069
You guys can go ahead
and go eat dinner.

15:53.070 --> 15:55.366
I'm gonna finish up this pile.

15:56.994 --> 15:58.204
We can't.

15:58.205 --> 16:00.794
We smash as one.
We eat as one.

16:02.130 --> 16:03.507
I'm so hungry.

16:05.971 --> 16:07.932
Oh, Binx--Winx, don't cry.

16:07.933 --> 16:09.727
Don't cry. Don't cry.

16:09.728 --> 16:11.565
Uh, I'll smash faster, okay?

16:11.566 --> 16:13.986
I'm sorry.
Oh, shit.

16:20.332 --> 16:22.169
You're so stupid.

16:22.170 --> 16:24.047
You didn't even consult us.

16:24.048 --> 16:26.177
We don't wanna
lose you, Torquey.

16:26.178 --> 16:27.470
Not to politics.

16:27.471 --> 16:28.807
You're not gonna lose me.

16:28.808 --> 16:30.603
I'm still gonna be
your provider.

16:30.604 --> 16:33.024
- How?
- You can't possibly beat Vise.

16:33.025 --> 16:34.569
He's never lost a de-bat.

16:34.570 --> 16:35.946
Oh, he's gonna destroy you.

16:35.947 --> 16:37.449
Let me tell you something.

16:37.450 --> 16:40.330
General Vise doesn't
believe in change.

16:40.331 --> 16:43.044
He looks at the NAG
and he sees what it is.

16:43.045 --> 16:45.758
But I see what it could be.

16:45.759 --> 16:48.179
This is the home
that we fought to create.

16:48.180 --> 16:52.229
And inside each one of you
is the power to make it better.

16:52.230 --> 16:53.815
Now, we may be settlers,

16:53.816 --> 16:57.991
but, oh, I refuse to settle.

17:01.582 --> 17:03.209
I believe in you,
Papa Torque.

17:06.091 --> 17:07.927
"Wheel Changemaker."

17:07.928 --> 17:10.683
Oh, now, see?
This is, uh--

17:10.684 --> 17:12.310
this is what I'm talking about.

17:12.311 --> 17:14.189
Come here, sweetie.

17:14.190 --> 17:16.736
Oh, yeah.

17:16.737 --> 17:18.991
Oh.

17:18.992 --> 17:21.287
Now, how's everybody
feeling about it now?

17:25.004 --> 17:27.048
Looks like we're all
on the same page.

17:29.304 --> 17:30.389
Cheers.

17:39.992 --> 17:41.911
Guys, come on, okay?

17:41.912 --> 17:43.665
You can't expect me to learn
how to smash things with a rock

17:43.666 --> 17:44.876
in just one day.

17:44.877 --> 17:46.755
It's gloopy

17:46.756 --> 17:48.675
because you were so slow

17:48.676 --> 17:50.679
and we had to wait.

17:50.680 --> 17:51.723
I'm--I'm sorry.

17:51.724 --> 17:53.017
I-I didn't realize that--

17:53.018 --> 17:54.227
How are they supposed
to get it

17:54.228 --> 17:55.939
through their
Smash Mouth now?

17:59.823 --> 18:00.949
Sorry.

18:18.026 --> 18:19.444
Guys.

18:19.445 --> 18:21.031
Guys, are--are there
nuts in this?

18:23.245 --> 18:25.248
Guys, seriously.
Are--are there nuts in this?

18:25.249 --> 18:27.085
There's a nut in it.

18:27.086 --> 18:28.880
Shit.

18:28.881 --> 18:30.091
Shit.

18:30.092 --> 18:32.053
Oh, God.

18:32.054 --> 18:33.640
Oh, this is bad.

18:33.641 --> 18:35.059
This is bad.
This is bad.

18:35.060 --> 18:36.395
Oh, God.

18:36.396 --> 18:38.482
Oh, no.

18:40.487 --> 18:42.658
Oh, no. Oh, no.

18:42.659 --> 18:45.539
Help me.

18:45.540 --> 18:46.541
Oh.

18:48.588 --> 18:50.717
It's not fu--it's not funny!

18:56.729 --> 18:57.730
None of these people
ever interacted

18:57.731 --> 18:59.357
in front of my cameras.

18:59.358 --> 19:00.861
The odds of that happening
are 20 quintillion to 1.

19:00.862 --> 19:02.113
Yeah, they gotta
be using dead drops.

19:02.114 --> 19:03.658
Let's run
a matching algorithm.

19:03.659 --> 19:05.077
Cross-reference
their movements.

19:05.078 --> 19:06.623
Wherever their paths cross,

19:06.624 --> 19:07.708
that's where we'll pick up
Athena's trail.

19:07.709 --> 19:09.670
That's gonna take hours.

19:09.671 --> 19:11.089
When was the last time
you slept?

19:11.090 --> 19:12.885
1951.

19:14.472 --> 19:16.893
Why don't you get some rest?

19:16.894 --> 19:17.979
Look there.

19:23.991 --> 19:25.953
That key-cuff will give you
access to any area

19:25.954 --> 19:27.623
in the compound.

19:27.624 --> 19:29.042
Make yourself at home.

19:31.422 --> 19:32.550
Thanks, Stu.

19:32.551 --> 19:35.429
I'm, uh--I'm glad I came back.

19:42.444 --> 19:43.738
Good night, Tiger.

19:44.950 --> 19:46.619
Did that just happen?

19:46.620 --> 19:48.540
You mean did she just take
a key to your place?

19:48.541 --> 19:49.959
Yeah.

19:49.960 --> 19:51.921
- Whoo!
- That just happened.

19:51.922 --> 19:53.090
It's all happening so fast.

19:53.091 --> 19:54.886
Hey, calm down.

19:54.887 --> 19:56.430
This is what you wanted,
isn't it?

19:56.431 --> 19:58.225
More than anything
in the whole world.

19:58.226 --> 20:01.900
But this Pointed Circle stuff
does worry me.

20:01.901 --> 20:02.985
You need to move up
the launch.

20:02.986 --> 20:04.822
- What?
- No.

20:07.829 --> 20:10.207
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.

20:10.208 --> 20:12.211
But I-I need more time
to explain it to her.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.840
I've lost her once.
I don't wanna lose her again.

20:13.841 --> 20:15.928
Stu, you and your
confidence issues.

20:15.929 --> 20:18.474
A few days ago,
she stabbed you repeatedly.

20:18.475 --> 20:21.229
Today she basically moved in.

20:21.230 --> 20:23.275
She likes you even more
than she knows.

20:23.276 --> 20:25.488
Trust me.
I know women.

20:25.489 --> 20:26.950
I'm a version of one.

20:33.965 --> 20:37.805
- Smashers have a code.
- It's called the Smasher Code.

20:37.806 --> 20:39.850
And it's unsmashable.

20:39.851 --> 20:42.731
But we're only as strong
as our weakest smasher,

20:42.732 --> 20:44.067
which is you.

20:44.068 --> 20:45.486
I'm sorry!

20:45.487 --> 20:48.158
Smash faster, nut breath.

21:55.043 --> 21:56.336
Oh.

21:56.337 --> 21:57.463
I'm putting this
over your heart.

21:57.464 --> 21:58.842
To protect you.

21:58.843 --> 22:00.929
Oh.

22:00.930 --> 22:02.933
Are you sure you're prepared?

22:02.934 --> 22:04.310
Did you put together
your cabinet?

22:04.311 --> 22:06.189
Oh, I like the way
you're thinking.

22:06.190 --> 22:07.568
Positive.

22:07.569 --> 22:09.947
Yeah, yeah, I've got
some fresh ideas.

22:09.948 --> 22:12.451
And some fairly unconventional.

22:12.452 --> 22:14.957
You're not using cards
out there, are you?

22:14.958 --> 22:17.504
- Good point.
- Gotta speak from the heart.

22:17.505 --> 22:19.717
You know, nobody likes a nerd.

22:19.718 --> 22:21.929
It killed Dukakis in '88.

22:21.930 --> 22:24.184
Listen, um, I'm not
going negative,

22:24.185 --> 22:27.481
but if cornered,
what are Vise's weaknesses?

22:27.482 --> 22:28.651
His knees.

22:28.652 --> 22:31.323
Oh, okay.

22:31.324 --> 22:33.493
I love you guys.

22:33.494 --> 22:36.458
But you're garbage
as political strategists.

23:18.459 --> 23:19.962
No humming!

23:19.963 --> 23:21.340
Shit.

23:25.056 --> 23:27.853
Are you ready
for tonight's de-bat?

23:27.854 --> 23:29.565
Meet your candidates.

23:29.566 --> 23:33.698
The Supreme Overlord,
Vise Myrmbeater!

23:33.699 --> 23:38.081
And the challenger,
Torque Wheelmaker!

23:49.146 --> 23:51.901
I so look forward to sharing
my ideas with you.

23:51.902 --> 23:55.366
Share them
in the dark void of death,

23:55.367 --> 23:56.911
throne snatcher!

23:56.912 --> 24:00.250
Candidates,
take your positions.

24:00.251 --> 24:03.508
Let the great de-bat begin!

24:04.552 --> 24:06.388
Ha, ha!

24:06.389 --> 24:08.392
Death battle! Death battle!

24:08.393 --> 24:10.145
Death battle! Death battle!

24:10.146 --> 24:11.899
Death battle!
Death battle!

24:11.900 --> 24:13.945
Death battle! Death battle!

24:13.946 --> 24:15.322
Death battle.

24:16.743 --> 24:18.621
Oh, death battle.

24:18.622 --> 24:20.332
Yeah, I missed a lot
of cues on this one.

24:20.333 --> 24:21.877
Torque,
what are you waiting for?

24:21.878 --> 24:23.923
Arm yourself from your cabinet!

24:26.638 --> 24:28.265
Oh, shit.

24:28.266 --> 24:29.392
Fight me!

24:29.393 --> 24:30.770
I misunderstood everything.

24:30.771 --> 24:31.772
I don't know.
Uh...

24:33.359 --> 24:34.945
Look, I-I didn't come here
to kill anyone.

24:36.741 --> 24:39.538
No, I have a few things
to say, if you'd just listen.

24:39.539 --> 24:41.834
Death battle! Death battle!

24:41.835 --> 24:45.340
- Your prayers to the sky!
- Ha, ha!

24:45.341 --> 24:46.719
Take it easy, okay?

24:46.720 --> 24:48.180
- Just--
- Curse you!

24:48.181 --> 24:49.641
Just put the sword down,
okay?

24:49.642 --> 24:51.019
We'll talk.

24:51.020 --> 24:53.440
I'll take it easy
on your head.

24:53.441 --> 24:54.610
Fool!

24:58.075 --> 25:00.162
For a century,
our people were at war.

25:00.163 --> 25:01.832
Come here!

25:01.833 --> 25:04.630
But for two decades now,
we've lived aboveground.

25:04.631 --> 25:07.092
- Stop that!
- Will you yield, sir?

25:07.093 --> 25:09.848
We must move our minds
aboveground as well!

25:09.849 --> 25:14.942
I'm going to tear your
heart out any second now!

25:34.064 --> 25:36.819
This is how you decide
who you want to lead you?

25:36.820 --> 25:39.866
A death battle between
a sand-brained POW

25:39.867 --> 25:41.745
and a half-brained elder?

25:41.746 --> 25:43.624
- Yes!
- No!

25:46.088 --> 25:48.133
Boo!

25:48.134 --> 25:50.555
When you have the shot
on Torque, take it.

25:50.556 --> 25:53.686
Copy, Athena.

25:59.031 --> 26:00.198
Torque!

26:00.199 --> 26:01.702
Hear me, people of the NAG!

26:01.703 --> 26:03.748
I offer real change!

26:23.914 --> 26:26.167
- That's him.
- Yep.

26:35.688 --> 26:37.064
Oh, God!

26:37.065 --> 26:39.360
Die, usurper!

27:20.652 --> 27:22.697
Maybe you're not a total
waste of space after all.

27:22.698 --> 27:25.035
- I'm sorry!
- Oh, my God!

27:26.539 --> 27:30.170
Careful with J1.
No brain jostling.

27:30.171 --> 27:31.757
Oh, oh, God!
They got me!

27:31.758 --> 27:33.552
The Pointed Circle!
Help!

27:33.553 --> 27:35.388
Help me!

27:35.389 --> 27:36.432
Hey.

27:52.883 --> 27:55.470
Winx?
Why'd you save me?

27:55.471 --> 27:58.434
You're one of us.

27:58.435 --> 28:00.063
The Smasher Code.

28:00.064 --> 28:02.527
It's unsmashable.

28:05.909 --> 28:08.204
Sorry that I tried
to strangle you earlier.

28:08.205 --> 28:09.916
It's just that I had this urge,
and it was--

28:09.917 --> 28:11.419
Stop apologizing.

28:11.420 --> 28:13.089
I'm in your home,
wearing your clothes,

28:13.090 --> 28:14.759
rummaging through your stuff,

28:14.760 --> 28:17.932
charging things I don't need
to your thumbprint.

28:17.933 --> 28:19.686
If I were you,
I'd try to kill me too.

28:19.687 --> 28:22.609
Only, you know,
I'd succeed.

28:22.610 --> 28:25.823
Hey, we all have
our limitations.

28:25.824 --> 28:27.744
Don't worry, I just have
one more little thing to do.

28:27.745 --> 28:28.829
Then I'm gone.

28:28.830 --> 28:30.541
- Promise?
- Promise.

28:30.542 --> 28:31.793
Okay, well, maybe before
you go, you could, like,

28:31.794 --> 28:33.338
I don't know--

28:33.339 --> 28:34.758
Teach you how to strangle
to completion?

28:34.759 --> 28:36.052
- Yeah.
- Yeah, felt good, didn't it?

28:36.053 --> 28:38.473
So good.

28:46.574 --> 28:48.702
Torque! Torque! Torque! Torque!

28:48.703 --> 28:50.581
Torque! Torque!
Torque! Torque!

28:50.582 --> 28:52.627
Torque! Torque! Torque! Torque!

28:52.628 --> 28:53.837
Torque! Torque!
Torque! Torque!

28:53.838 --> 28:56.802
Torque! Torque! Torque! Torque!

28:56.803 --> 28:59.223
Supreme Overlord Vise
is dead.

29:03.357 --> 29:06.237
Long live
Supreme Overlord Torque!

29:11.081 --> 29:14.714
Torque, Torque, Torque!
