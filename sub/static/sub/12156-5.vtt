00:01.930 --> 00:04.582
Emily's making me go on a
date tonight with Bernard.

00:04.582 --> 00:07.820
Taker her out tonight. Show her what she'll
be missing by marrying some old fart.

00:07.820 --> 00:09.896
You called me a bitch.
Get out!

00:09.896 --> 00:13.089
All of our produce comes from
within fifty miles of New York.

00:13.089 --> 00:14.815
You claim a hundred. Do the math.

00:14.814 --> 00:15.865
Oh! A rat!

00:16.646 --> 00:20.155
You could come back to
my place if you like.

00:20.493 --> 00:22.338
<i>I trusted you with my daughter!</i>

00:22.338 --> 00:25.674
Emily's taking a break from me,
so I'm taking a break from you.

00:25.674 --> 00:27.149
Ray, thank God you're here!

00:27.713 --> 00:29.329
- Louis?
- Help me!

01:30.135 --> 01:32.585
I still say that's not a legal style.

01:33.087 --> 01:36.255
When Jonathan and I used to
play games, he didn't cheat.

01:36.255 --> 01:38.003
Well, call Jonathan and play with him.

01:38.199 --> 01:39.425
You know we're not talking.

01:40.058 --> 01:42.130
Although we do have therapy today.

01:42.368 --> 01:43.938
Get the yell—yeah, get those.

01:43.938 --> 01:46.072
And stop complaining
about my technique!

01:46.528 --> 01:48.594
If I throw it underhand, then
my back's gonna catch on fire

01:48.594 --> 01:50.170
and flames are gonna
shoot out of my asshole.

01:50.170 --> 01:51.083
Get that one.

01:52.113 --> 01:55.178
I'm sorry. The, uh, girdle
doesn't offer any relief?

01:55.474 --> 01:56.064
No.

01:56.883 --> 01:58.275
Only oxycontin.

01:59.300 --> 02:02.075
Luckily, Belinda renewed her prescription.

02:02.646 --> 02:04.552
She's turning me into Rush Limbaugh.

02:04.552 --> 02:07.172
Other than the drugs,
how's it going with Belinda?

02:07.882 --> 02:13.055
Well, it's wonderful,
but I feel really, really guilty.

02:13.203 --> 02:14.556
Leah has no idea.

02:15.123 --> 02:16.956
I've never been like this before.

02:16.956 --> 02:19.630
Oh, I get it.
You're leading a double life.

02:19.889 --> 02:24.461
I've been doing that for so long I'm
probably over a hundred years old by now.

02:24.461 --> 02:26.645
Yeah, this elder love really crept up on me.

02:27.144 --> 02:29.355
Other than cumming in
my pants all the time,

02:29.980 --> 02:31.461
I used to be pretty normal.

02:31.461 --> 02:37.638
That's a term I don't know, "elder love."
It sounds like an herbal tea or something.

02:37.638 --> 02:39.417
- It's most common with women.
- Mm.

02:39.417 --> 02:41.270
Males don't get it as much,
but we're out there.

02:41.733 --> 02:43.551
There's a convention
every year in Boca.

02:44.012 --> 02:44.925
Florida.

02:46.551 --> 02:50.457
Jonathan and I were supposed to go down
to Key West to visit the Hemingway house,

02:50.457 --> 02:52.437
but I guess that's not gonna happen.

02:52.983 --> 02:54.560
Well, maybe therapy will work.

02:54.567 --> 02:55.791
I don't know, maybe.

02:56.274 --> 02:59.796
When a couple goes to counseling,
it's usually the end.

03:11.752 --> 03:14.697
Ray said Antrem's restaurant
is killing your business.

03:14.808 --> 03:16.722
I wish there was some
way I could help you.

03:20.863 --> 03:22.887
It depresses me that
Antrem is successful,

03:22.887 --> 03:25.399
because it means that being a
driven sociopath is effective.

03:26.275 --> 03:27.314
At least professionally.

03:27.314 --> 03:28.271
Exactly.

03:28.271 --> 03:31.080
You know, Antrem's a symbol
of what's wrong with nature.

03:31.080 --> 03:34.768
If there's sunshine, you have darkness.
If there's health, you have disease.

03:34.768 --> 03:36.666
If there's me, you have Antrem.

03:36.674 --> 03:37.816
Like me and Louis Green.

03:37.816 --> 03:39.982
No, you see, this is why
we need counseling.

03:39.982 --> 03:42.871
You suck everything back to you
like a needy magnet.

03:43.233 --> 03:43.857
Sorry.

03:44.366 --> 03:45.554
Tell me more about Antrem.

03:47.497 --> 03:50.444
I open a hundred-mile
artisanal restaurant,

03:50.444 --> 03:54.766
and that engorged tick opens a fifty-miler just to spite me,

03:54.766 --> 03:56.194
to, to destroy me.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.711
Well, can't you become a fifty-miler?

03:57.711 --> 04:00.558
I'd love to, but I have
no idea where his farms are.

04:00.749 --> 04:03.534
And then Sifton gave him a
rave in the <i>Times</i>,

04:03.534 --> 04:08.171
said that you can taste the farmer's hands
pulling the cucumbers from the earth.

04:08.654 --> 04:11.507
- Well, that's not hygienic.
- Of course it isn't!

04:19.074 --> 04:20.889
This is friendship counseling?

04:21.334 --> 04:23.295
Three basic tenets of friendship:

04:23.295 --> 04:25.986
no penetration between friends,

04:26.256 --> 04:29.529
friends do not involve
friends in Ponzi schemes

04:29.734 --> 04:31.059
—that happened to me—

04:31.989 --> 04:35.207
and a true friend
is someone that helps you move.

04:35.207 --> 04:39.477
Well, the situation is cut and dry.
Jonathan crossed a line with my daughter.

04:39.477 --> 04:40.603
What kind of line?

04:40.603 --> 04:44.042
Inappropriate leering, groping, daterape?

04:44.198 --> 04:45.781
- You have very big eyes.
- What?!

04:45.781 --> 04:47.656
No, no. No, nothing like that.

04:47.656 --> 04:51.091
but he was responsible for the
fracture of her perfect nose,

04:51.091 --> 04:53.273
and he caused her to stop speaking to me.

04:53.273 --> 04:54.388
- That's terrible.
- George,

04:54.388 --> 04:57.085
you can't blame thirty
years of miscommunication

04:57.085 --> 04:59.536
one one broken nose
and an alcohol relapse.

04:59.536 --> 05:03.282
She also smoked dope and saw a
stuffed animal have anal sex.

05:03.282 --> 05:05.607
You told me to show her a good time!

05:13.956 --> 05:15.535
Oh! You're home early.

05:15.535 --> 05:18.733
Yeah, I was able to get away for an hour.

05:19.332 --> 05:20.629
Where are the girls?

05:20.757 --> 05:23.206
Upstairs, melting in
front of the television.

05:23.459 --> 05:25.486
I'm gonna take them to the
botanical garden soon.

05:26.441 --> 05:29.882
Oh, that's nice.

05:30.361 --> 05:32.560
When did you start drinking Bailey's?

05:32.560 --> 05:35.833
I don't know. Recently I got a...
taste for it.

05:36.041 --> 05:37.084
Hmm.

05:40.622 --> 05:44.713
Ray, uh, I came home because
I've been missing you.

05:45.141 --> 05:45.826
Really?

05:46.037 --> 05:49.855
I don't like the distance
I've been feeling lately,

05:49.998 --> 05:51.616
with you on the couch,

05:52.466 --> 05:53.616
far away.

05:53.863 --> 05:55.533
Just down the stairs. You know?

05:55.533 --> 05:58.292
And, um, I should have been working, but

05:58.688 --> 06:02.327
I Googled you, and I
started getting hot.

06:03.403 --> 06:05.560
I never told you this, but

06:06.175 --> 06:09.011
I love your drawings
of Super Ray's cock.

06:15.942 --> 06:16.971
Leah, the girls.

06:16.978 --> 06:18.604
They won't leave the TV.

06:18.604 --> 06:19.217
Okay.

06:25.072 --> 06:29.251
- Ray, you have a gray pubic hair.
- That's mine! That's mine.

06:29.251 --> 06:31.409
Of course it's yours.

06:34.675 --> 06:38.729
Jonathan, based on your technique,
I can tell you are...

06:39.578 --> 06:42.782
a pathological, codependent people-pleaser,

06:42.782 --> 06:44.266
and that's not good.

06:44.405 --> 06:45.094
I'm sorry.

06:45.094 --> 06:46.613
Don't say you're sorry.

06:46.613 --> 06:48.069
- I'm sorry.
- Stop it!

06:49.878 --> 06:50.871
George.

06:50.871 --> 06:51.636
Yes.

06:51.636 --> 06:55.108
I can tell you are a very good lover.

06:55.108 --> 07:00.669
Oh! Well, thank you.
Oh! Look at you.

07:00.669 --> 07:05.042
Jonathan, what is your issue with George?
'Cause he seems perfect to me.

07:05.042 --> 07:08.395
Well, I don't have an issue, really.
I just want him back in my life!

07:08.395 --> 07:12.051
You see, my whole father figure
situation is very screwy right now.

07:14.495 --> 07:16.648
I hear what Jonathan is saying,

07:17.425 --> 07:19.838
but I have nothing to give.
I can only take.

07:19.838 --> 07:22.193
My business is under siege.
I'm a...

07:22.612 --> 07:26.561
I'm a needy boy wrapped in the
garb of an elder statesman.

07:26.561 --> 07:32.069
That sounds fancy and eloquent,
but is it really how you feel?

07:32.069 --> 07:38.546
Yes. Also, I've signed up for a musical revue,
so I don't have time for my old friends.

07:38.710 --> 07:42.724
- George, I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize to the people you love!

07:42.914 --> 07:45.634
<i>Show</i> them your affection with your <i>actions</i>!

07:45.634 --> 07:47.154
Dig into my heel!

07:47.829 --> 07:49.670
It helps with my menses.

07:51.448 --> 07:52.479
I'm bloated.

07:54.594 --> 07:56.127
I'm usually thinner.

08:08.622 --> 08:09.244
Excuse me!

08:10.076 --> 08:11.732
I'm with the FDAUJA.

08:12.077 --> 08:13.853
What farms does this restaurant use?

08:14.007 --> 08:16.214
I live in the basement of an American.

08:16.515 --> 08:17.952
I have never been a nanny!

08:17.952 --> 08:19.001
I don't care about that.

08:19.001 --> 08:20.562
I want names of farms!

08:20.562 --> 08:21.362
Now.

08:23.449 --> 08:26.537
Please! I love this country! I'm a Yankee fan!

08:26.537 --> 08:29.033
But I also like the Mets if that's your thing.

08:29.033 --> 08:30.697
I'm not with immigration.

08:31.389 --> 08:32.551
I'm a friend.

08:32.859 --> 08:33.696
Sort of.

08:34.193 --> 08:37.407
Just tell me: where does
Richard & Sons get its produce?

08:38.287 --> 08:42.433
All I know is the mucho malo goes on
the run every night to the farms.

08:42.740 --> 08:45.141
Who is this mucho malo?
What is his name?

08:48.270 --> 08:50.899
They call him...
Green!

08:55.104 --> 08:57.267
Those girls are so beautiful.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.479
I wish you'd introduce
them to my grandchildren.

09:01.787 --> 09:02.762
Yeah, maybe.

09:03.506 --> 09:05.847
They call it a playdate. Heh!

09:06.962 --> 09:08.423
Back in my day, we called it,

09:08.423 --> 09:11.954
"Hey, look after my kids, I gotta go to the
doctor for my shingles!

09:14.954 --> 09:16.127
Listen, Belinda.

09:17.250 --> 09:20.017
- The last three weeks have been wonderful.
- I know.

09:20.438 --> 09:21.476
It's a gift.

09:21.476 --> 09:23.437
I'd love to tell Father Malucci,

09:23.693 --> 09:26.965
but he would want me to be married
before having intercourse.

09:26.965 --> 09:27.980
Father Malucci?

09:27.980 --> 09:29.887
Well, he was trying to set me up,

09:29.895 --> 09:34.457
but all the widowers in my church are
awash, rhuemy-eyed, lumpy with tumors.

09:36.206 --> 09:38.607
I needed someone young, like you!

09:38.607 --> 09:40.380
I do love being with you.

09:41.296 --> 09:42.085
It's just...

09:42.421 --> 09:44.899
You know how I feel after we make love?

09:45.378 --> 09:50.757
Like an iron's been on top of me, and I get
all straightened out like a piece of linen.

09:51.523 --> 09:53.696
You set me right, kid.

09:54.017 --> 09:55.792
God, Belinda, I—ach!

09:58.410 --> 10:01.088
I just don't know if I can keep this up.
I feel so guilty!

10:01.088 --> 10:03.078
I keep taking baths like Lady Macbeth!

10:03.078 --> 10:05.471
Listen, I don't want this to stop!

10:05.471 --> 10:08.711
You make me feel as beautiful as these flowers!

10:10.205 --> 10:11.358
To hell with it!

10:17.743 --> 10:19.651
You're gonna live with the guilt, Ray.

10:19.651 --> 10:23.786
You might be the last good thing
I'll ever have in my life.

10:31.345 --> 10:33.774
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

10:36.929 --> 10:40.154
So tell me, George, have
you ever sung before?

10:40.161 --> 10:44.674
Well, forty years ago,
I was a Whiffenpoof at Yale.

10:45.247 --> 10:47.752
Wasn't Cole Porter a Whiffenpoof?

10:47.963 --> 10:54.336
♪ And that's why birds do it, bees do it. ♪

10:54.562 --> 10:58.592
♪ Even educated fleas do it. ♪

10:58.592 --> 11:05.038
♪ Let's do it. Let's fall in love. ♪

11:06.608 --> 11:07.476
Oh!

11:07.997 --> 11:09.222
That was lovely!

11:09.824 --> 11:10.608
Thank you.

11:11.380 --> 11:14.679
So, why do you want to take
singing lessons, George?

11:14.679 --> 11:19.172
Ah! Well, I agreed to perform in a musical
review at the Yale Club, a fundraiser,

11:19.172 --> 11:22.996
and they assigned me to
"Dream the Impossible Dream"!

11:22.996 --> 11:25.531
Great, I love that song.
This should be fun.

11:25.869 --> 11:26.427
Alright.

11:26.427 --> 11:28.965
- Let's do a little breathwork first, shall we?
- Yeah.

11:29.353 --> 11:31.732
- Just, ah...
- Oh! Well, alright.

11:31.732 --> 11:35.702
gonna warm up that lean
Gary Cooper body of yours.

11:35.702 --> 11:40.305
- Oh! Gary Cooper!
- Grab it with both hands and just <i>bend</i> over.

11:40.305 --> 11:42.283
Make your body an L.

11:42.620 --> 11:43.503
You do it.

11:44.008 --> 11:44.637
Okay.

11:46.353 --> 11:49.776
Alright, we're going to relax the back,

11:49.776 --> 11:53.660
and we're gonna breathe and
make an "Oh, oh, oh!" sound.

11:53.660 --> 11:56.956
- Oh, oh, oh, oh!
- George, you're holding a lot of

11:56.956 --> 12:00.392
- sadness or something.
- I do have a lot of sadness, actually.

12:00.392 --> 12:02.725
I, I've been very melancholic lately.

12:02.725 --> 12:04.727
Well, let's try to
breathe it out, shall we?

12:04.727 --> 12:08.535
- "Oh! Oh! Oh!"
- Oh, oh, oh, oh...

12:08.535 --> 12:09.993
- Ohhh...
- George,

12:10.365 --> 12:12.643
- Yeah?
- I think this may take more than breathing.

12:14.195 --> 12:15.858
Do you smoke pot?

12:16.611 --> 12:17.371
I do!

12:21.165 --> 12:23.077
Now Leah's fallen back in love with me.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.241
It must be pheromonal.

12:25.241 --> 12:29.205
All the sex with Belinda's got me
spraying testosterone like a cat.

12:29.614 --> 12:32.313
You know, I <i>did</i> read about that in
the science section of the <i>Times</i>.

12:32.313 --> 12:34.793
The more sex a man <i>has</i>, the more sex he <i>gets</i>.

12:34.793 --> 12:36.457
It's like a positive Catch-22.

12:36.457 --> 12:37.778
- Wah!
- Hello, Alpha Team.

12:37.778 --> 12:39.003
God damn it!

12:39.106 --> 12:40.727
What a bunch of Nervous Nellies.

12:40.727 --> 12:44.893
- I thought you guys were battle tested.
- Why did you do tha— where'd he go?

12:45.463 --> 12:48.342
<i>Both</i> of my testicles completely
retracted when you did that!

12:48.791 --> 12:49.911
Isn't that your normal state?

12:50.169 --> 12:54.133
- Both your testicles deep in your
body like the ovaries of a woman?
- <i>HAW HAW</i>

12:54.133 --> 12:55.224
You got the tracking device?

12:55.333 --> 12:56.920
Uh...ffirmative.

12:57.712 --> 13:01.095
Also, I brought along some
<i>bonus</i> surveillance gear.

13:01.907 --> 13:04.973
- Free of charge?
- I'm not a communist, I charged it to George's account.

13:05.089 --> 13:08.468
So, Ray, you're the <i>only</i>
one who can plant this on Green.

13:08.468 --> 13:10.103
What? Why me?
I don't want any part of hiM!

13:10.103 --> 13:12.581
Oh, don't be such a
swishy, nancy fruitcake!

13:12.581 --> 13:15.683
It <i>has</i> to be you.
Green will never let me or Howard <i>near</i> him,

13:15.683 --> 13:17.576
but you guys bonded in jail!

13:17.831 --> 13:19.481
You said you passed him in the hallway!

13:21.243 --> 13:22.645
We did do time together.

13:25.202 --> 13:25.945
Excuse me.

13:26.695 --> 13:27.676
You have water.

13:28.531 --> 13:29.386
Ray.

13:29.804 --> 13:30.961
What are you doing here?

13:31.551 --> 13:34.378
Is that worm with legs Jonathan
going to be joining you?

13:34.378 --> 13:38.805
- No, I was just, uh...
- Well, we can't serve you dressed like that, so...

13:39.237 --> 13:40.590
I guess this is good day.

13:41.217 --> 13:47.260
No I wasn't, uh, looking do eat, I just
happened to be walking by, and I was wondering

13:47.260 --> 13:49.964
how you were doing since
our time in the hoosegow.

13:49.964 --> 13:53.453
Really, that's why you're here?
You're concerned about me?

13:53.453 --> 13:56.030
Well, not a lot of people have been
through what we've been through, and I...

13:57.291 --> 13:58.272
How was it for you?

13:58.555 --> 14:00.448
Oh, I felt like Primo Levi.

14:01.309 --> 14:03.453
I did make one nice friend, José Luís.

14:04.291 --> 14:06.551
But overall the experience was traumatic, I—

14:07.149 --> 14:08.129
I'm not sleeping,

14:08.683 --> 14:12.407
'cause of my nerves, I'm developing
small ulcers in my armpits....

14:12.407 --> 14:13.622
I'm sorry.

14:13.720 --> 14:14.690
Mm, thank you.

14:15.695 --> 14:16.563
Oh!

14:17.441 --> 14:21.277
I bet those armpit ulcers
are really painful.

14:21.838 --> 14:24.160
I think you're the only one
who understands me, Ray.

14:24.160 --> 14:25.346
When I do sleep,

14:25.932 --> 14:29.208
I have this dream I'm in a tank
full of lobsters, and they're all

14:29.640 --> 14:32.949
nipping at me with their
cruel, red claws.

14:32.949 --> 14:34.609
Shhhhh.

14:35.442 --> 14:36.410
It's okay.

14:36.728 --> 14:38.211
Those lobsters are phantoms.

14:41.356 --> 14:42.232
Oh, Raymond.

14:44.437 --> 14:45.637
- <i>Louis!</i>

14:45.943 --> 14:47.671
- <i>Where is that chubby little handmaiden?</i>

14:47.871 --> 14:49.404
- <i>Table five needs to be cleared!</i>

14:49.404 --> 14:50.798
- I have to go.
- Yeah.

14:52.625 --> 14:53.388
Ray.

14:54.369 --> 14:55.585
If this should continue,

14:56.705 --> 14:58.139
it would be nice if you shaved.

15:04.474 --> 15:06.458
- How'd it go? Everything all right?
- Fine!

15:06.458 --> 15:09.017
- Did the Tango suspect anything?
- Nope!

15:09.655 --> 15:10.627
How did you do it?

15:11.068 --> 15:11.850
I hugged him.

15:11.850 --> 15:14.048
Like an old... prison buddy.

15:14.048 --> 15:16.153
That's it! Okay?
That's the end of the story.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.650
Well, my work here is done!

15:18.650 --> 15:21.070
By the way, Howard, thank you
for recommending Laurie.

15:21.218 --> 15:25.258
The session didn't work, but she has
really nice feet <i>and</i> gave good advice.

15:25.663 --> 15:26.977
I love her feet!

15:27.368 --> 15:30.555
You know, I got insight into some of my
mother issues working on her big toe!

15:30.561 --> 15:31.110
Huh!

15:31.583 --> 15:35.200
But where therapy failed, I'm hoping that
this operation will save a friendship.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.164
Me too.

15:36.886 --> 15:39.172
You love George, and I don't blame ya!

15:39.582 --> 15:40.534
Alright!

15:48.413 --> 15:50.995
That guy gives me the creeps.
Do you go to him for everything?

15:51.631 --> 15:54.299
Not everything, just therapy
referrals and detective gadgets.

15:59.060 --> 16:00.842
I hope you don't think I'm a slut,

16:00.842 --> 16:03.366
Josephine, for sleeping
with you immediately.

16:04.089 --> 16:05.443
Not at all.

16:06.192 --> 16:09.079
- It felt very 1977.
- Mmhm.

16:09.595 --> 16:13.313
- Well, I think it was a <i>great</i> first lesson.
- Mm, yeah.

16:13.485 --> 16:14.805
I loved it.

16:17.018 --> 16:18.830
You pierced my heart.

16:19.322 --> 16:20.073
Oh.

16:24.399 --> 16:25.652
Did I scare you?

16:26.573 --> 16:28.334
Well, a little.

16:28.739 --> 16:33.354
Yo-you should know that I have a long
track record of letting women down,

16:33.354 --> 16:35.855
and my business is falling apart,

16:35.855 --> 16:37.831
so I'm not very available,

16:37.831 --> 16:38.916
emotionally

16:38.916 --> 16:40.580
or, or emotionally.

16:41.120 --> 16:44.954
Well you should know that I have a
long track record of being let down,

16:44.954 --> 16:49.382
so we're perfect for each other, and you
are a pothead, so we're doubly perfect.

16:54.576 --> 16:58.574
Ah! Oh my God! Oh, that's beautiful.

16:58.574 --> 17:00.149
I want one!

17:02.801 --> 17:07.180
Ray, I haven't wanted to ask,
but how <i>is</i> Belinda in bed?

17:07.771 --> 17:10.203
Well, here's a little taste.
The other night, I was on top of her,

17:10.203 --> 17:11.373
and I was stoned,

17:12.686 --> 17:16.357
and it was like all of her past selves fanned
out in front of me like a deck of cards.

17:16.357 --> 17:17.507
What? Really?

17:17.507 --> 17:19.585
Yeah, I saw all the women that she's been.

17:19.585 --> 17:23.003
From her twenties, thirties,
forties, fifties, sixties...

17:23.003 --> 17:26.550
seventies, eighties, nineties...
naughts...

17:27.420 --> 17:28.669
I made love to them all!

17:30.691 --> 17:33.136
It's like a harem, but
with one senior citizen.

17:33.136 --> 17:35.401
Holy shit, that's incredible!

17:36.375 --> 17:37.546
There's Green.

17:40.499 --> 17:42.096
I can't believe he's smoking.

17:42.096 --> 17:43.768
Must have picked it up in prison.

17:45.822 --> 17:46.506
Alright.

17:50.721 --> 17:52.813
Looks like he's making a left
at the end of the alleyway.

17:52.813 --> 17:54.145
Yeah, I can <i>see</i> that.

18:29.207 --> 18:31.619
What's he doing?
That's not an organic farm!

18:31.625 --> 18:33.292
It's not even a nice supermarket!

18:57.160 --> 18:58.260
Oh my God!

18:59.071 --> 19:01.105
C-Town is Antrem's farms!

19:01.105 --> 19:03.964
I <i>knew</i> that fifty mile claim
stunk like yesterday's fish!

19:03.964 --> 19:05.427
Call George, he's gotta see this.

19:05.427 --> 19:07.101
- Okay.
- But don't tell him I'm here.

19:07.101 --> 19:09.269
Just say you're in trouble.
This way, when he gets here,

19:09.269 --> 19:11.882
I can explain it to him and
look heroic in his eyes!

19:16.895 --> 19:20.958
♪ Voulez-vous? Voulez? ♪

19:21.229 --> 19:25.251
♪ Voulez-vous? Voulez?... ♪

19:25.928 --> 19:27.935
Oh, this is wonderful!

19:33.458 --> 19:36.351
Josephine, I'm sorry, I have to...
Keep dancing!

19:38.274 --> 19:39.068
Hello?

19:39.068 --> 19:39.871
George?

19:40.188 --> 19:41.317
Look, I'm in trouble.

19:41.317 --> 19:45.149
I need you to come to C-Town Supermarket
on 130th and Broadway immediately.

19:45.215 --> 19:47.000
Wh-why? What's going on?

19:47.000 --> 19:49.732
I've been falsely accused of shoplifting.

19:49.732 --> 19:50.722
I need you.

19:51.321 --> 19:52.513
Don't know if that worked.

19:55.878 --> 20:01.307
I'm, I'm so sorry, but I have to go.
My, my number two friend needs me.

20:01.307 --> 20:04.686
He's been caught shoplifting
in a supermarket.

20:04.686 --> 20:06.706
He has food issues.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.767
Your number <i>two</i> friend?

20:08.767 --> 20:11.061
Who's your number one friend?

20:11.061 --> 20:13.541
A young boy I was once very fond of.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.379
We're not talking anymore.

20:17.596 --> 20:18.933
A young boy?

20:25.073 --> 20:26.362
Oh my God, here he is.

20:26.362 --> 20:28.977
Alright. Don't be nervous.
I can handle George. Watch this.

20:30.227 --> 20:34.406
Ray, what's the meaning of this?
Did you lie to me?

20:34.746 --> 20:35.857
Jonathan made me call you!

20:36.918 --> 20:37.664
Wh—?

20:39.522 --> 20:42.834
George, I'm really sorry friendship
counseling didn't go well.

20:42.834 --> 20:46.357
Did you drag me all the way
up here just to apologize?

20:46.357 --> 20:48.864
Do you know I left a singing
lesson to come here?

20:49.212 --> 20:50.092
At midnight?

20:50.092 --> 20:50.921
Yes.

20:50.921 --> 20:52.933
- Well, this is really important.
- No.

20:53.356 --> 20:56.115
Not breaking Emily's nose was important.

20:56.841 --> 20:57.849
I'm gonna go.

20:58.294 --> 20:59.113
George, wait!

21:00.059 --> 21:01.304
There's something I need to show you.

21:13.375 --> 21:15.375
Son of a bitch!

21:15.375 --> 21:17.305
Antrem and his dirty tricks!

21:17.305 --> 21:19.116
But isn't it great that I discovered this?

21:19.651 --> 21:21.789
Yes, yes, but what are we gonna do?

21:21.789 --> 21:22.780
I have a plan.

21:23.944 --> 21:25.312
You and I will go in deep,

21:25.312 --> 21:27.840
and Ray will play defense to guard
against the quarterback's sneak.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.919
Jonathan, you know i don't follow baseball.

21:35.153 --> 21:37.639
Park me close to him and then act like a stockboy!

21:37.810 --> 21:38.526
Got it!

22:01.905 --> 22:02.882
Mr. Christopher?

22:03.528 --> 22:05.803
When did you start working here?

22:05.803 --> 22:08.366
Oh, well, uh, just today actually.

22:08.366 --> 22:10.241
He doesn't work here, Green!

22:10.918 --> 22:12.894
Jonathan, what are you
doing here, you maggot?

22:12.894 --> 22:15.471
We're onto you, Green! And Richard <i>and</i> Sons!

22:15.471 --> 22:16.647
Fifty miles?!

22:16.647 --> 22:19.014
Your restaurant is a fraud
and we've got proof!

22:19.014 --> 22:21.675
How <i>dare</i> you belittle
what Richard and I have built!

22:21.675 --> 22:25.150
- But it was built on a lie!
- Everything's built on a lie, you idiot!

22:25.150 --> 22:26.469
That <i>is</i> true, Jonathan.

22:26.469 --> 22:28.705
And anyway, what proof do you have?

22:28.846 --> 22:31.922
I'm buying these chickens
for my personal use.

22:31.922 --> 22:32.975
That's a lot of chickens.

22:32.975 --> 22:35.360
- And also... ha!
- Hey!

22:36.321 --> 22:38.828
George, push me! Push me!

22:39.482 --> 22:40.835
Left with the botellas!

22:43.831 --> 22:45.202
You stole my phone!

22:45.706 --> 22:46.894
Of <i>course</i> I did!

22:46.894 --> 22:48.376
What a trite thing to say.

23:01.686 --> 23:02.631
Incoming!

23:03.021 --> 23:03.929
Reloading!

23:03.929 --> 23:04.634
Duck!

23:04.634 --> 23:05.878
I mean, chicken!

23:13.204 --> 23:15.254
You'll never get away with this, Green!

23:15.576 --> 23:18.452
Cleanup in aisle six, ha ha ha ha!

23:22.656 --> 23:23.697
Louis, stop!

23:28.498 --> 23:29.291
Raymond?

23:29.604 --> 23:33.763
- Are you all right, George?
- Ha! I'm wonderful!

23:33.908 --> 23:34.695
Really?

23:34.695 --> 23:35.593
But I—

23:35.593 --> 23:37.476
- I failed you again!
- Yeah...

23:37.476 --> 23:39.030
but I've missed this,

23:39.644 --> 23:40.961
our calamities.

23:41.796 --> 23:42.902
I've missed you.

23:43.376 --> 23:44.583
I've missed you, too, George.

23:45.324 --> 23:47.698
- Oh! Look who's here.
- Ray!

23:48.632 --> 23:49.579
How'd you do it?

23:50.056 --> 23:51.616
I have my ways.

24:04.179 --> 24:05.239
I've seen enough.

24:05.893 --> 24:07.677
Honestly, I had no idea this was happening.

24:08.184 --> 24:10.975
Ever since the arrest, Louis just
hasn't been the same, you know.

24:11.108 --> 24:12.349
Gotta get the kid some help.

24:12.567 --> 24:14.358
But first I'm gonna take a <i>belt</i> to his ass!

24:14.359 --> 24:16.472
- I did it for you!
- Get back in your coat closet,

24:16.472 --> 24:17.873
you <i>twisted</i> little snot!

24:21.438 --> 24:23.149
I will call the <i>Times</i> and have them

24:24.198 --> 24:25.772
print a complete retraction.

24:25.772 --> 24:27.588
I don't want to destroy you, Richard.

24:28.075 --> 24:29.880
I just want a level playing field.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.830
Oh, that's so admirable of you, George.

24:32.966 --> 24:36.193
You know you're weak in
most every way that's important?

24:37.008 --> 24:38.231
But you do play fair.

24:38.586 --> 24:39.322
Thank you.

24:44.575 --> 24:46.240
Our business here is done.

24:52.652 --> 24:53.549
Ray, wait!

24:54.538 --> 24:55.946
I'll catch up with you guys in a second.

25:00.974 --> 25:02.163
Tell me it meant nothing to you.

25:03.333 --> 25:04.139
Our kiss.

25:04.515 --> 25:05.172
Louis,

25:06.277 --> 25:09.417
that erection you felt against your leg

25:10.197 --> 25:11.381
was purely involuntary.

25:11.918 --> 25:13.327
I didn't feel any erection.

25:14.488 --> 25:15.142
Huh!

25:15.568 --> 25:16.246
Oh, you didn't?

25:18.266 --> 25:21.108
It doesn't matter, okay?
'Cause that's the end now.

25:21.674 --> 25:22.960
I have enough women in my life.

25:25.323 --> 25:26.174
I understand.

25:27.096 --> 25:31.103
For nearly forty years, I've waited for love and sympathy.

25:32.611 --> 25:33.590
I can wait a bit longer.

25:34.644 --> 25:35.537
Okay.

25:39.417 --> 25:42.803
Ray seems to have a real
wizard-like effect on Green.

25:42.803 --> 25:45.654
He says it's because Green's a fan
of his <i>Super Ray</i> comic.

25:45.654 --> 25:48.148
Ah, makes sense. The power of art.

25:48.777 --> 25:51.887
Hey, you and I should start thinking
about our trip down to Key West

25:51.900 --> 25:53.312
to visit the Hemingway house,

25:53.495 --> 25:57.139
and then, if you want, we could go on
down to Cuba and see his place there.

25:57.139 --> 25:58.814
- Really?!
- Yeah! Sure.

25:59.104 --> 26:01.314
I've always wanted to return to Havana.

26:01.314 --> 26:03.187
I had a lost weekend there once.

26:03.187 --> 26:04.459
Oh, here's our wizard!

26:04.873 --> 26:06.233
Everything alright with Green?

26:06.233 --> 26:06.856
Yeah.

26:08.380 --> 26:09.606
Is it too early to get a drink?

26:09.606 --> 26:14.542
No! Never too early for a
well-made organic bloody Mary.

26:14.542 --> 26:18.527
You get your vitamins from the tomato
juice, and the celery gives you your fiber.

26:18.527 --> 26:21.036
And the, uh, vodka helps you with your
mood the first thing in the morning.

26:21.036 --> 26:21.924
Which is healthy.

26:21.924 --> 26:22.839
Exactly.

26:22.839 --> 26:24.304
You guys know a lot about nutrition.

26:24.304 --> 26:26.453
Well, I <i>do</i> own a restaurant, you know.
