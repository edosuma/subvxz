00:29.960 --> 00:35.808
<i>This is the one
and only PBR World Final!</i>

00:37.680 --> 00:40.729
<i>Luke Collins is young,
easy on the eyes,</i>

00:40.800 --> 00:42.320
<i>and a magician on a bull.</i>

00:42.440 --> 00:46.843
<i>But right now,
he's about to face his ultimate demon.</i>

00:47.000 --> 00:50.800
<i>He is about to ride a bull
who needs no introduction.</i>

00:50.960 --> 00:55.409
<i>This bull has 74
consecutive buck-offs.</i>

00:55.560 --> 00:59.804
<i>Las Vegas,
you know who I'm talking about.</i>

01:00.480 --> 01:04.041
<i>This is Rango!</i>

01:40.360 --> 01:43.569
And he is ready
to rock and roll!

01:49.400 --> 01:50.401
Let go!

02:03.320 --> 02:05.322
<i>Wait a minute!</i>

02:08.520 --> 02:10.727
<i>Luke Collins is down.</i>

02:32.680 --> 02:34.409
Hey, do you guys
know where Sophia is?

02:34.560 --> 02:35.641
No, sorry.

02:35.840 --> 02:37.888
Tell them
to save our seats.

02:38.320 --> 02:39.321
Did you see Sophia?

02:39.400 --> 02:40.481
She's in her room studying.

02:40.680 --> 02:42.921
But you're not
gonna get her to go.

02:46.320 --> 02:48.846
Hi, Marcia.
Thanks for not disturbing.

02:49.760 --> 02:51.762
I have a present for you.

02:51.920 --> 02:53.251
Wait. You were serious?

02:53.840 --> 02:55.410
Do I look serious?

02:55.560 --> 02:56.925
No, you look ridiculous.

02:57.080 --> 02:58.923
Oh, come on, Soph.
They're so much fun.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.445
I can't.
I have work to do.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.443
It's second
semester senior year.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.410
Your grades are stellar.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.040
You already have a job
lined up in New York.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.929
An internship.
All of the work and none of the pay.

03:09.120 --> 03:10.451
Half the house is going.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.443
I don't see myself
as a rodeo gal.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.284
Fine. It's not the rodeo,
it's bull riding.

03:14.440 --> 03:15.441
There's a difference.

03:15.880 --> 03:17.120
You're missing the point.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.520
Hot guys, I know.

03:18.680 --> 03:20.045
No, not "hot guys."

03:20.200 --> 03:22.601
The hottest guys
you have ever seen.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.609
Please.

03:27.800 --> 03:28.801
Fine.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.801
But I'm not wearing
those cowboy boots.

03:36.480 --> 03:37.606
So, this is it, huh?

03:37.760 --> 03:40.331
Yeah, this is it.
"The toughest spost on dirt"!

03:40.480 --> 03:42.767
Yeah,
I need a hot cowboy.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.166
Whoa!

04:11.800 --> 04:13.643
Oh, my God!
Whoa!

04:13.720 --> 04:15.324
What was that?

04:19.680 --> 04:20.647
Look at that guy
in the chute.

04:20.720 --> 04:24.691
<i>Fans, we're gonna go now to
the Ridin' Dirty bucking chute...</i>

04:24.840 --> 04:26.888
<i>where we have got
local hero Luke Collins</i>

04:26.960 --> 04:28.325
<i>from Walkertown,
North Carolina!</i>

04:28.680 --> 04:29.806
Go, Luke!

04:37.040 --> 04:40.408
<i>He's a three-time
PBR World Finals champion.</i>

04:40.560 --> 04:44.087
<i>For over a year,
an injury has sidelined him.</i>

04:44.680 --> 04:45.806
<i>But he's back.</i>

04:45.960 --> 04:48.850
<i>Currently ranked
52nd in the world.</i>

04:49.000 --> 04:50.490
<i>He has a long way to go.</i>

04:54.880 --> 04:56.609
You ready for this?

04:56.760 --> 04:58.046
We'll see.

05:11.720 --> 05:14.690
<i>And today,
he will be riding Sweet Thang.</i>

05:42.080 --> 05:43.081
Let's go!

05:56.200 --> 05:57.201
Yeah, go!

06:04.240 --> 06:05.366
Whoo! Yeah!

06:10.040 --> 06:13.123
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have ourselves a champion.

06:13.280 --> 06:15.601
Yeah! That's my boy!

06:15.760 --> 06:17.171
I feel like I should stand!

06:17.320 --> 06:19.084
<i>Luke Collins
now moves up...</i>

06:19.240 --> 06:21.242
<i>to 48th in
the world standings.</i>

06:41.920 --> 06:42.921
Hey!

06:46.080 --> 06:47.286
Keep it.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.011
Oh!

06:59.080 --> 07:00.684
Work it, girl.

07:04.840 --> 07:06.330
It's so big on you.
I know.

07:16.480 --> 07:19.802
<i>Lay me down
by the old oak tree</i>

07:19.880 --> 07:24.169
<i>Don't cut my hair
when they bury me</i>

07:24.240 --> 07:30.725
<i>Light me up
and send me out to sea</i>

07:30.800 --> 07:31.801
<i>One, two, three</i>

07:39.400 --> 07:42.085
<i>In the backwoods company...</i>

07:51.040 --> 07:52.246
Nice riding, cowboy.

07:53.080 --> 07:55.651
Of course,
my grandma could have made
the eight on Sweet Thang.

07:56.280 --> 07:57.560
It's good to
have you back, Luke.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.803
It was getting too
easy without you.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.481
Jared!

08:02.120 --> 08:03.770
Hey, buddy.
I'll be right back.

08:03.840 --> 08:04.887
Hey, Larry.

08:05.280 --> 08:06.964
Good to see you.
Good to see you here.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.804
Luke, hey, man.
How are you doing?

08:08.960 --> 08:10.007
Congratulations, man.

08:10.080 --> 08:11.809
I know it feels good to get a
win under your belt, doesn't it?

08:11.920 --> 08:12.921
Sure does.
Yeah.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.843
Let me ask you.
You need to come visit us.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.002
I wanna introduce you
to some good folks from PBR.

08:17.160 --> 08:18.241
Important folk.
Come get a beer.

08:18.400 --> 08:19.925
You got it.
I'll be right behind you.

08:20.080 --> 08:21.809
Yes. Okay.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.241
Hey, um...

08:23.680 --> 08:25.250
You had a good night.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.923
But it's a long
way back to the top.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.171
I got a hat just like that.

08:43.360 --> 08:44.441
Yeah. Sorry.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.490
No, you hold on to it.
Looks better on you.

08:51.160 --> 08:52.207
Like this?

08:57.480 --> 08:58.720
May I?

08:59.640 --> 09:00.880
Sure.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.088
Uh-huh.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.090
Yeah.
Okay.

09:11.760 --> 09:12.966
Beautiful.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.127
Luke.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.201
Sophia.

09:20.440 --> 09:21.965
Nice to meet you, Sophia.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.209
I'm gonna... Can I...
Can I get you a drink?

09:30.760 --> 09:32.489
You were the big
winner tonight, right?

09:33.600 --> 09:36.683
I think I should be the one
buying you a beer.

09:36.840 --> 09:39.161
Oh, no.
Doesn't work like
that where I'm from.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.729
Okay.

09:43.120 --> 09:44.121
You're buying.

09:46.520 --> 09:47.567
Sophia!

09:47.720 --> 09:49.165
Hi! Whoa.
There you are.

09:49.320 --> 09:52.005
I've been looking
all over for you.

09:52.160 --> 09:53.685
Um, this is Marcia.
She's my...

09:54.200 --> 09:55.281
Sister.

09:55.360 --> 09:56.850
Sorority sister.

09:57.360 --> 10:00.842
BFFs, if we're
speaking technically.

10:02.680 --> 10:03.806
You are gorgeous.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.690
Time to put you in a cab.
What?

10:06.840 --> 10:09.241
I just need everything
to stop spinning for a sec.

10:10.920 --> 10:12.001
I'm gonna be sick.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.010
What?
I think I'm gonna be sick.

10:14.160 --> 10:15.571
How sure?
High 90s.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.211
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa!

10:19.040 --> 10:20.530
Yeah. We got her.

10:20.640 --> 10:21.721
Okay.

10:21.880 --> 10:24.326
I should take her home.

10:24.720 --> 10:26.404
Yeah. Probably a good idea.

10:27.520 --> 10:28.521
I would say that
I'd call you...

10:28.600 --> 10:29.886
but I have a feeling,
where you come from...

10:30.040 --> 10:31.883
it just doesn't
work like that.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.845
That's right.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.684
I'll call you?

10:36.480 --> 10:38.721
You're telling me
that he has called you,

10:38.800 --> 10:40.245
and you haven't called him back?

10:40.400 --> 10:42.880
I'm moving to New York
in two months.
What's the point?

10:43.040 --> 10:44.565
What's the point?

10:44.720 --> 10:47.007
Have you gotten
a good look at him?

10:47.160 --> 10:50.323
Those shoulders, those eyes.
That's the point.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.401
Okay, look.
I am starting a new
chapter of my life.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.324
I do not need
any distractions.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.400
Sophia,
you are literally the only girl I know...

10:57.520 --> 10:59.488
who wouldn't have
a fling with a cowboy.

11:42.400 --> 11:43.731
Okay.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.609
Straight to voice-mail.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.250
Straight to voice-mail.

11:58.440 --> 11:59.487
<i>Hello?</i>

11:59.640 --> 12:01.483
Hey, Luke. It's Sophia.

12:01.640 --> 12:04.041
<i>I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to hang out sometime...</i>

12:04.240 --> 12:05.924
<i>or grab coffee
or something.</i>

12:06.120 --> 12:07.929
No, I'm okay.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.526
Okay.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.128
Uh, well, I guess I should
just let you go, then.

12:15.920 --> 12:17.331
I'm just messing
with you, Sophia.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.401
How about dinner?

12:22.320 --> 12:24.322
You mean, like a date?

12:24.880 --> 12:26.370
Yeah, like a date.

12:26.800 --> 12:28.325
Wow!

12:28.480 --> 12:30.881
Most guys, they just say,
"What are you doing later?"

12:31.040 --> 12:33.281
Or they text late at night,
"Hey, come over."

12:33.480 --> 12:36.927
Yeah, well,
call me old-school.

12:37.080 --> 12:38.730
<i>Should I meet you somewhere?</i>

12:38.880 --> 12:40.723
<i>No. I'll pick you
up at your place.</i>

12:40.880 --> 12:42.450
<i>Does 6:00 work for you?</i>

12:42.600 --> 12:43.806
Okay.

12:44.480 --> 12:47.927
<i>I feel a sin comin' on</i>

12:48.400 --> 12:52.564
<i>Please Jesus don't
hold me back</i>

12:53.840 --> 12:59.324
<i>I know it ain't mine
but I want it so bad</i>

12:59.680 --> 13:05.449
<i>The smoke in the whiskey's
got me feeling easy</i>

13:05.520 --> 13:09.844
<i>And after I'll fade
in the glass</i>

13:11.040 --> 13:13.566
<i>And you can see it</i>

13:13.720 --> 13:16.041
<i>All over my face</i>

13:16.120 --> 13:17.121
Ladies.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.646
<i>Sweet temptation</i>

13:19.720 --> 13:21.643
<i>All over the place</i>

13:22.800 --> 13:25.690
<i>Give me tall dark
and handsome</i>

13:25.760 --> 13:28.525
<i>Mix it up with
something strong</i>

13:30.040 --> 13:32.771
<i>I feel a sin comin' on</i>

13:33.040 --> 13:34.041
Hi.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.690
Hi.
I know you.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.604
Marcia, right?
Mmm-hmm.

13:37.760 --> 13:39.444
The last time
I saw you...

13:39.600 --> 13:41.443
you were a little blurry.

13:41.680 --> 13:42.681
Yeah.

13:42.880 --> 13:44.803
You can come in.
Thank you.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.043
She's upstairs getting ready.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.205
Hi.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.247
Hi.

13:53.680 --> 13:54.727
Hi.

13:58.360 --> 13:59.407
Um...

13:59.800 --> 14:00.801
Thank you.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.241
So sweet.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.682
He's even
bought her flowers.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.601
Shall we?

14:09.800 --> 14:10.801
Yeah.

14:12.120 --> 14:14.691
- Good night, ladies.
- Good night, you guys.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.803
Oh, my God!

14:18.960 --> 14:20.371
I want a cowboy!

14:20.520 --> 14:22.329
He is so hot!

14:23.680 --> 14:25.842
You never said you lived
in a sorority house.

14:26.640 --> 14:30.201
Uh... Yeah, well,
it's the cheapest rent on campus.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.725
Is it like
I would imagine?

14:36.320 --> 14:38.288
How would you imagine?

14:38.920 --> 14:39.921
Eh...

14:40.280 --> 14:42.089
Pillow fights in your underwear.

14:42.240 --> 14:43.890
No. Come on!

14:45.920 --> 14:48.400
We don't wear underwear.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.641
I got you, a little.
Uh-huh. You did.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.002
Okay. So where are we going?

15:00.640 --> 15:01.721
That's a surprise.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.849
It's breathtaking.

15:39.280 --> 15:40.566
Yeah.

15:43.600 --> 15:46.444
Well, aren't you
full of surprises?

15:47.640 --> 15:49.847
I can't believe
you made dinner for me.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.490
Well, Amy made dinner.

15:53.040 --> 15:55.168
Who is Amy?
Smokin' Amy's.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.122
Best barbecue
in North Carolina.

16:01.400 --> 16:03.767
I kind of got into that and classical,
which is so strange.

16:03.920 --> 16:06.241
I know. It's weird.
It's totally like...

16:06.440 --> 16:08.647
How did a girl from Rutherford,
New Jersey end up

16:08.720 --> 16:09.960
in the middle
of North Carolina?

16:10.080 --> 16:12.208
Yeah,
something like that.

16:13.240 --> 16:16.369
I ended up getting
a scholarship down here,
so I couldn't pass it up.

16:16.560 --> 16:19.609
Scholarship?
Pretty fancy.

16:19.760 --> 16:22.366
I kind of knew that
tips from my dad's diner...

16:22.520 --> 16:24.841
weren't really going to cut it.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.004
I just...

16:28.160 --> 16:30.447
I love art.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.648
I love everything about it.
I love studying it.

16:32.840 --> 16:34.842
I love the culture
that it brings...

16:35.000 --> 16:37.480
and the whole
human experience...

16:37.680 --> 16:39.648
just all wrapped up into one.

16:40.280 --> 16:42.203
Anger, sadness...

16:42.360 --> 16:44.601
love, passion,
acceptance...

16:44.760 --> 16:46.603
history.

16:49.640 --> 16:51.369
Never mind. I don't know.
What about you?

16:51.520 --> 16:52.960
Tell me about you.
What's your story?

16:53.080 --> 16:55.924
No, mine's, uh...

16:56.080 --> 16:57.889
Mine's pretty simple.

16:58.040 --> 17:00.361
Just keep winning events.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.921
Make it to the top 35.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.726
Go to Vegas.
Make it to the finals.

17:07.520 --> 17:08.567
I got some
making up to do.

17:08.720 --> 17:11.246
I got hurt last year.

17:12.680 --> 17:14.569
What do you mean
you got hurt?

17:14.760 --> 17:16.967
All bull riders get hurt.

17:17.400 --> 17:20.006
It's not "if."

17:20.400 --> 17:22.242
It's "when."

17:23.599 --> 17:25.011
And how bad.

17:26.359 --> 17:29.170
How bad was yours?
Serious?

17:30.640 --> 17:33.769
I've got a few
more years to ride...

17:35.120 --> 17:37.327
before I'm just
a washed-up bull rider.

17:40.040 --> 17:41.530
I'm going to be the best.

17:42.720 --> 17:43.926
It's just all about winning?

17:44.080 --> 17:45.320
No, it's not all
about winning.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.323
Well, not entirely.

17:50.640 --> 17:53.166
I've got a family ranch.

17:53.320 --> 17:55.004
It's been a tough couple years.

17:55.160 --> 17:58.881
My mom is kind of
all on her own.

17:59.840 --> 18:02.047
I just gotta
keep making money.

18:03.840 --> 18:04.841
Mmm.

18:07.840 --> 18:10.161
Are you cold?
You're cold.

18:10.840 --> 18:11.841
A little.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.446
Where are you going?

18:16.160 --> 18:19.448
What do they call
this nail polish color?

18:19.600 --> 18:20.886
This would be "clear."

18:21.040 --> 18:23.008
Clear.
Yeah.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.089
Right. Clear.
That makes sense.

18:27.840 --> 18:28.966
It's good.

18:31.880 --> 18:35.202
You are pretty smooth
for a country boy.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.361
Me?

18:36.440 --> 18:37.521
Yeah, you.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.724
Come on, I saw the way
those girls stared at you.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.884
You think
I'm that type of guy?

18:48.720 --> 18:49.881
No.

18:50.040 --> 18:53.044
No one has ever done
anything like this for me before.

19:05.080 --> 19:07.651
So, uh, do you like
North Carolina?

19:09.280 --> 19:10.964
Yeah, I do.

19:11.760 --> 19:13.330
It's beautiful.
Yeah.

19:15.840 --> 19:16.841
Um...

19:17.080 --> 19:21.483
I'm actually moving to New York
at the end of next month.

19:24.320 --> 19:26.607
I got this job.

19:27.920 --> 19:30.924
Well, it's an internship,
actually.

19:31.080 --> 19:33.765
But it's a pretty big deal.
It's at a gallery in Manhattan.

19:35.120 --> 19:36.531
Okay.

19:39.040 --> 19:40.041
Uh...

19:40.960 --> 19:43.770
That's why it took me so long
to call you back.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.685
I just didn't think that
this would even be a good idea.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.684
I'm glad you did.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.690
Yeah?
Yeah.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.122
This is just bad timing.

19:59.400 --> 20:00.481
Yeah.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.809
Oh, I probably
should take you home.

20:08.360 --> 20:09.361
Gonna rain.

20:21.800 --> 20:23.643
Did you see that?
What?

20:36.480 --> 20:37.481
Luke!

20:38.000 --> 20:39.684
What is it?

20:45.480 --> 20:47.289
Call 911!

20:55.640 --> 20:56.641
Hey! Wake up!

20:56.800 --> 20:57.881
Is he alive?

20:58.040 --> 20:59.371
Here, hold this.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.201
Box.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.687
Box.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.330
What did he say? "Box"?

21:46.520 --> 21:48.887
I think you just
saved that guy's life.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.530
We both did.

21:50.680 --> 21:52.409
Oh, come on,
I held the flashlight.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.722
You were amazing.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.562
I just hope
that he's okay.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.922
I'll take you home.

22:03.720 --> 22:05.529
I think I'm going
to stay.

22:05.720 --> 22:06.721
Really?

22:07.600 --> 22:10.570
Yeah, at least until he gets
out of the emergency room.

22:11.040 --> 22:12.405
Then I'll wait with you.

22:12.880 --> 22:14.405
No, it's fine.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.681
Really.

22:16.360 --> 22:18.761
And thank you for tonight.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.041
Yeah, it was a...

22:21.200 --> 22:23.043
it was a great night.

22:23.200 --> 22:24.200
Kind of.

22:27.280 --> 22:30.045
Good luck with
everything in New York.

22:30.160 --> 22:31.685
Mmm-hmm.

23:55.760 --> 23:58.491
"April 10th, 1940.

23:58.640 --> 24:00.529
<i>"My dearest Ruth...</i>

24:00.680 --> 24:04.207

24:04.360 --> 24:06.886
<i>"But when you walked in

24:11.040 --> 24:13.691
<i>"I knew my life would

24:17.280 --> 24:19.806
You are the new family
the Rabbi has told us about.

24:20.720 --> 24:21.801
From Vienna?

24:22.320 --> 24:23.367
Uh, yes.

24:23.480 --> 24:24.891
I am Hannah...

24:25.040 --> 24:27.281
and this is my daughter,
Ruth.

24:27.480 --> 24:28.720
Nice to meet you.

24:28.880 --> 24:30.644
I'm Sarah...

24:30.800 --> 24:33.849
and this is my son, Ira.

24:35.720 --> 24:36.846
Ira?

24:37.240 --> 24:38.526
Ira?

24:53.400 --> 24:55.243
- Good <i>Shabbes.</i>
- Good <i>Shabbes.</i>

25:02.080 --> 25:03.320
Good <i>Shabbes.</i>

25:04.600 --> 25:05.761
Good <i>Sha...</i>

25:07.040 --> 25:08.883
<i>The following
days were consumed...</i>

25:09.040 --> 25:11.930
<i>with plotting ways in which
I could talk to you...</i>

25:12.080 --> 25:15.448
<i>now that you had found
a home in my small community.</i>

25:39.280 --> 25:43.126
<i>But I wasn't the only
one seeking your attention.</i>

25:47.120 --> 25:49.487
<i>This would take
some more time.</i>

26:02.480 --> 26:03.920
He's awake,
if you'd like to see him.

26:04.520 --> 26:05.567
You have to eat something,
Mr. Levinson.

26:05.720 --> 26:07.480
It's the only way you're
going to get better.

26:07.600 --> 26:08.647
I'm old.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.450
I've had a heart attack...

26:10.600 --> 26:12.011
a hip replacement...

26:12.160 --> 26:13.650
Surgery in both knees.

26:14.320 --> 26:16.482
How much better
am I going to get?

26:21.080 --> 26:22.127
Who are you?

26:23.160 --> 26:25.527
I, uh...
I came to drop this off.

26:25.800 --> 26:26.801
How'd you get that?

26:27.920 --> 26:29.081
From your car.

26:29.240 --> 26:31.368
You asked me
to get it for you.

26:31.800 --> 26:33.165
Oh, you...

26:34.360 --> 26:35.771
You pulled me out?

26:36.120 --> 26:37.849
No, my friend Luke
pulled you out...

26:38.000 --> 26:40.287
but you asked me to
go back and get this box.

26:43.360 --> 26:44.600
You don't remember?

26:44.760 --> 26:46.046
Hmm.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.127
Well, thank you.

26:51.680 --> 26:52.681
Very much.

26:53.360 --> 26:56.682
He seems to like you,
which is a first for him.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.731
See if you can get him
to eat something,
would you?

27:01.720 --> 27:05.361
She has the coldest hands
I've ever felt.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.009
I think she soaks
them in ice water...

27:08.160 --> 27:09.889
before she comes by.

27:19.320 --> 27:21.402
You really
should eat something.

27:21.560 --> 27:23.005
I'm done.

27:34.560 --> 27:36.562
Is that what
Ruth would want?

27:39.760 --> 27:41.888
How do you know about Ruth?

27:42.040 --> 27:43.246
Did you read my letters?

27:43.400 --> 27:45.084
What do you care?

27:45.240 --> 27:46.890
You're done.

27:52.560 --> 27:54.562
They're beautiful.

28:00.760 --> 28:03.081
She was a beautiful woman.

28:06.360 --> 28:08.442
In every way.

28:11.120 --> 28:15.045
I can see why they
were so precious to you.

28:32.640 --> 28:35.883
I haven't been able
to read them for years.

28:36.040 --> 28:38.646
Even with my glasses.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.928
Do you want me
to read them to you?

28:52.120 --> 28:53.804
But you have to eat first.

29:11.840 --> 29:14.605
"May 25th, 1940.

29:14.760 --> 29:16.330
"For the first
time in my life...

29:16.520 --> 29:21.321
"I was hoping the service at the
synagogue would be longer."

29:31.680 --> 29:33.125
Excuse me.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.883
Are you ever
going to talk to me?

29:48.000 --> 29:49.206
Excuse me?

29:49.360 --> 29:51.886
I always see you there,
lurking around.

29:53.880 --> 29:55.041
I don't lurk.

29:55.200 --> 29:57.168
You do lurk.

29:57.320 --> 30:00.722
But then you never talk to me.
Am I so frightening?

30:01.800 --> 30:02.961
No, I...

30:08.200 --> 30:11.886
What you did to that poor
rose was unforgiveable.

30:13.720 --> 30:15.006
You saw that?

30:17.720 --> 30:20.564
Don't be embarrassed.
It was a lovely gesture.

30:20.720 --> 30:22.051
Ruthie?

30:24.080 --> 30:26.162
Want to walk me home?

30:27.080 --> 30:28.127
Oh...

30:28.200 --> 30:29.486
What about David Stein?

30:29.680 --> 30:31.682
He can walk my mother home.

30:34.200 --> 30:37.249
Vienna is beautiful
and so cultured.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.607
It has more
artists than Paris.

30:40.560 --> 30:43.166
At least it did
before the war.

30:43.600 --> 30:45.602
It must have been
hard for you to leave.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.046
Yeah.

30:48.720 --> 30:51.087
Especially for my parents.

30:51.280 --> 30:53.851
But it would have been worse
if we had stayed.

30:56.840 --> 30:58.763
Everyone thought
we were being foolish...

30:58.960 --> 31:01.770
that my father
was overreacting.

31:01.960 --> 31:03.883
Now we can't even contact
our relatives anymore.

31:05.440 --> 31:06.601
Sometimes I think...

31:07.640 --> 31:09.688
what right do I have
to be happy

31:09.800 --> 31:11.802
when there's so much
suffering in the world?

31:12.800 --> 31:15.770
I guess you could say,
what right do you have to be unhappy?

31:18.960 --> 31:20.121
True.

31:20.280 --> 31:23.284
For a country pumpkin,
you're quite philosophical.

31:25.480 --> 31:26.925
What?

31:27.080 --> 31:29.526
It's a "country bumpkin"
not a "country pumpkin."

31:30.320 --> 31:31.446
What?

31:32.800 --> 31:35.121
I think I prefer
the way you said it.

31:40.600 --> 31:41.647
Well.

31:43.120 --> 31:45.327
Thank you
for walking me home.

31:45.480 --> 31:47.130
Oh, you're welcome.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.850
It was a pleasure.

32:02.760 --> 32:03.761
Ruth...

32:07.480 --> 32:09.130
Do you want to go
out with me sometime?

32:12.000 --> 32:13.684
I'm free after Shabbat.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.411
Wait. You want
to go out tonight?

32:17.560 --> 32:20.211
We're not getting
any younger, Levinson.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.688
You can wait there
if you want.

32:31.520 --> 32:34.000
"Forever yours...

32:34.480 --> 32:35.686
"Ira."

32:41.560 --> 32:43.164
You want me to
read you another one?

32:44.720 --> 32:46.006
Mmm.

32:49.160 --> 32:51.162
But...

32:52.520 --> 32:53.851
Could you maybe...

32:55.520 --> 32:57.363
Could you maybe come back?

33:08.160 --> 33:10.322
Carolina Thunder's
a good draw.

33:10.920 --> 33:12.001
Sure you can handle him?

33:12.160 --> 33:15.289
<i>Savannah, Georgia fans,
put your hands together..</i>

33:15.440 --> 33:19.161
<i>For the one,

<i>We will move our attention down
to the Cooper Tires bucking chute...</i>

<i>where Evan Matthews from Summerville,
Georgia is set to go.</i>

33:36.640 --> 33:40.201
<i>He is about to face a bull
that needs no introduction.</i>

33:40.360 --> 33:42.362
<i>85 consecutive buck-offs...</i>

33:47.720 --> 33:50.564
<i>He is going
for the Gold Buckle.</i>

34:00.800 --> 34:02.006
That looks familiar.

34:14.080 --> 34:15.605
<i>Let's go
to Luke Collins.</i>

34:15.920 --> 34:18.605
<i>If he makes a qualified ride
on Carolina Thunder...</i>

34:19.080 --> 34:22.880
<i>he will crack the top 35 and
punch his ticket to Vegas!</i>

34:23.080 --> 34:24.161
Let's go!

34:31.400 --> 34:33.368
<i>He comes down too early</i>

34:33.440 --> 34:34.929
<i>in a costly mistake.</i>

34:35.960 --> 34:38.280
<i>A mistake that could cost
him a trip to the World Finals...</i>

34:38.360 --> 34:40.647
<i>and ultimately,
a World Title.</i>

34:40.800 --> 34:42.928
<i>You really gotta wonder...</i>

34:43.080 --> 34:44.844
<i>where this guy
is mentally right now.</i>

34:45.000 --> 34:47.081
<i>The incident with
Rango before he rode...</i>

34:47.239 --> 34:48.446
Good ride, Luke.

34:48.560 --> 34:49.840
<i>...has affected
his mental focus.</i>

35:04.640 --> 35:06.130
Damn it!

35:24.360 --> 35:27.887
<i>What I've got
I don't want</i>

35:28.000 --> 35:30.970
<i>All it does is hover
and taunt</i>

35:31.480 --> 35:34.529
<i>Reminding me
what I used to be</i>

35:34.600 --> 35:37.080
<i>What I may never be again</i>

35:37.960 --> 35:40.930
<i>Learn it all again tomorrow</i>

35:41.320 --> 35:44.130
<i>Learn it all again tomorrow</i>

<i>Nothing I have you can
borrow or steal</i>

the conquering hero.

35:52.760 --> 35:54.364
Hey, Mom.

35:56.440 --> 35:58.363
You want eggs?
No.

36:00.520 --> 36:01.726
So, how did it go?

36:05.760 --> 36:07.888
Well, you left the ring
on your own two feet.

36:08.040 --> 36:10.486
So, it's a victory for me.

36:11.560 --> 36:13.360
When are you gonna
stop the bull riding, Luke?

36:15.120 --> 36:17.122
Mom, I told you, I can't.

36:17.320 --> 36:19.971
Really? So you forgot
about your head injury?

36:20.040 --> 36:21.041
I'm a grown man.

36:21.240 --> 36:23.129
I just want you to get
to be an old man.

36:25.360 --> 36:26.600
Thanks.

36:32.600 --> 36:34.284
You're scaring
the hell out of me, Luke.

36:34.920 --> 36:36.888
Please just give it up.
Don't worry.

36:41.960 --> 36:43.007
So, what's going on?

36:46.040 --> 36:47.485
Nothing.

36:49.880 --> 36:50.881
Nothing.

36:55.680 --> 36:56.761
I met a girl.

36:57.200 --> 36:59.123
You meet girls all the time.
No.

37:00.600 --> 37:03.171
This one's different.

37:04.880 --> 37:06.211
I can't stop
thinking about her.

37:06.840 --> 37:08.205
So?

37:08.360 --> 37:10.806
She moves to New York
in two months.

37:11.720 --> 37:15.566
So, I guess
that's that, right?

37:16.400 --> 37:17.970
You soak
your hand in ice water.

37:18.120 --> 37:19.400
I do no such thing.

37:19.880 --> 37:22.486
I'm the only person at
the hospital who still talks to you.

37:22.560 --> 37:23.561
Am I interrupting?

37:24.160 --> 37:26.083
I was just about
to strangle him! But...

37:26.240 --> 37:27.651
Strangle me before dinner...

37:27.800 --> 37:29.560
so I don't have to eat
another hospital meal.

37:29.680 --> 37:30.966
The sooner the better.

37:32.320 --> 37:33.481
Enjoy his letters.

37:37.120 --> 37:38.167
You look good.

37:40.680 --> 37:41.727
Shall we?

37:42.280 --> 37:43.281
Yeah.

38:00.640 --> 38:03.530
"July 12th, 1941
Oh.

38:06.840 --> 38:08.968
That was a good day.

38:11.760 --> 38:15.082
"Dearest Ruth,
the memories of our adventure...

38:16.120 --> 38:18.282
"are always
dancing in my mind."

38:18.480 --> 38:20.687
<i>Seems like yesterday...</i>

38:20.840 --> 38:23.605
<i>you helped me see the world
in a whole different way.</i>

38:23.760 --> 38:24.761
I don't know why
you insist we get

38:24.840 --> 38:26.365
all dressed up
just to go to a movie.

38:26.520 --> 38:28.841
In Vienna,
everyone always dresses up.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.401
Even just to stroll
in the park. It's elegant.

38:31.560 --> 38:33.210
It is also July
in North Carolina.

38:33.680 --> 38:35.648
Oh, let me show you something.
I have to show you something!

38:35.800 --> 38:36.801
What?

38:37.000 --> 38:39.002
Ruth, we're going to be late.

38:52.520 --> 38:54.727
It's by an artist
in Black Mountain.

38:54.880 --> 38:56.928
What's Black Mountain?
It's an arts college.

38:57.080 --> 38:59.686
A whole movement,
right here in North Carolina.

39:00.720 --> 39:01.881
And isn't it wonderful?

39:02.840 --> 39:05.002
Such a personal landscape.

39:05.600 --> 39:08.285
It's so direct and frank.

39:09.640 --> 39:11.881
Simplified and distorted.

39:12.040 --> 39:14.361
All at the same time.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.290
Don't you love it?

39:20.120 --> 39:22.122
I love how much
you love it.

39:29.440 --> 39:30.441
Come on.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.047
What? No, no, no.

39:33.520 --> 39:34.681
Excuse me.

39:44.120 --> 39:46.691
All right.
You want to dance?
Let's dance.

39:53.800 --> 39:56.326
Oh!

40:07.160 --> 40:08.491
Wow.

40:08.960 --> 40:10.803
Whoo!

40:44.840 --> 40:48.003
<i>That kiss,
our first kiss...</i>

40:48.200 --> 40:51.488
<i>it was a promise
of everything to come.</i>

41:01.120 --> 41:03.248
<i>The days became months.</i>

41:03.400 --> 41:06.290
<i>We ventured on
weekends to new places.</i>

41:06.480 --> 41:09.245
<i>Never once had I been
on vacation.</i>

41:09.440 --> 41:10.680
<i>Had I, though...</i>

41:10.840 --> 41:14.367
<i>it could never have been
as memorable as these.</i>

41:15.400 --> 41:16.447
What?

41:20.960 --> 41:24.203
It's the first time North Carolina
has felt like home.

41:53.760 --> 41:56.604
But yet,
with my most important student...

41:56.760 --> 41:58.728
I am a total failure.

41:58.880 --> 42:00.848
Ruth has fallen in love
with contemporary art.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.606
Father thinks that art stopped
with Matisse and Picasso.

42:03.760 --> 42:06.923
I don't think it stopped.
But it's taken a long nap.

42:07.080 --> 42:09.208
You try and raise
your children right, Ira...

42:09.360 --> 42:12.569
and they grow up
and think for themselves.

42:12.720 --> 42:13.960
Very good. Very good.

42:14.120 --> 42:15.326
It's tragedy!

42:19.920 --> 42:22.321
It was nice seeing you talk like that.

42:22.480 --> 42:25.962
Nothing would make me happier
than a lifetime of days like this.

42:26.920 --> 42:28.729
Hey, Ruth. I need to ask
you something.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.370
Wait.

42:35.880 --> 42:39.043
I want a big family.
A really big family.

42:41.520 --> 42:44.364
I've always wanted one
since I was a little girl.

42:46.080 --> 42:48.447
With everything
that's going on now...

42:49.360 --> 42:51.488
I feel this need,
this responsibility,

42:51.600 --> 42:53.682
to bring life back
into the world.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.129
Sounds perfect.

43:02.360 --> 43:03.407
You can ask me now.

43:05.840 --> 43:06.841
Ruth...

43:06.920 --> 43:08.968
I know I'm not a rich man.

43:09.120 --> 43:11.600
Don't know
the last thing about art.

43:12.160 --> 43:13.491
All I can do is promise
to love you...

43:13.640 --> 43:15.600
every second of every day
for the rest of my life.

43:16.040 --> 43:17.371
Really?

43:21.320 --> 43:22.321
Will you marry me?

43:23.160 --> 43:24.207
Yes!

43:24.360 --> 43:27.569
Yes, yes, yes!
What took you so long?

43:32.080 --> 43:33.286
Welcome to the family.

43:34.200 --> 43:35.884
Thank you.
So good to have you.

43:39.760 --> 43:42.843
"With love, Ira."

44:04.880 --> 44:07.326
I'll come back tomorrow.

44:22.400 --> 44:26.883
<i>I'm gonna
set aside my pride</i>

44:29.320 --> 44:34.121
<i>Not gonna be the one
to say "goodbye"</i>

44:34.200 --> 44:36.441
<i>Neither am I</i>

44:37.040 --> 44:39.646
<i>Oh, tonight</i>

45:03.880 --> 45:05.928
Mr. Levinson?
Do I know you?

45:06.720 --> 45:08.085
Luke Collins.

45:09.560 --> 45:11.005
Remember, off 119...

45:11.560 --> 45:14.484
when you decided to
bust open that guard rail?

45:16.640 --> 45:19.041
Oh, you saved my life.

45:20.400 --> 45:21.401
Thank you.

45:21.560 --> 45:22.925
Hi.

45:25.640 --> 45:26.721
Hi.

45:30.400 --> 45:31.401
Is this your Luke?

45:32.280 --> 45:34.282
This is my friend Luke.

45:34.560 --> 45:35.800
Yes.

45:36.280 --> 45:37.930
Your friend. Hmm.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.331
Mmm-hmm.

45:42.400 --> 45:43.526
What are you doing here?

45:45.920 --> 45:48.764
I found this on
the floor of my truck.

45:48.920 --> 45:51.605
Figured you might wanna
hang on to that one.

45:53.800 --> 45:57.441
<i>December 7th, 1941.</i>

45:58.080 --> 46:02.005
<i>Nothing made me happier than knowing
we were going to be married.</i>

46:02.160 --> 46:05.004
<i>But the world you and
your family had fled...</i>

46:05.440 --> 46:07.090
<i>finally caught up to us.</i>

46:07.480 --> 46:10.131
<i>The United States of America...</i>

46:10.280 --> 46:13.409
<i>Was suddenly
and deliberately attacked...</i>

46:13.560 --> 46:16.040
<i>by Naval and Air Forces...</i>

46:16.200 --> 46:18.771
<i>of the Empire of Japan.</i>

46:21.240 --> 46:22.969
Promise me you'll come back.
I will.

46:23.120 --> 46:25.248
Promise me, Ira!

46:25.400 --> 46:26.765
I promise.

46:28.560 --> 46:30.483
Look at me. I promise.

46:36.720 --> 46:38.768
Come back to me!

46:54.720 --> 46:56.245
Help!

47:03.640 --> 47:05.290
We can't just
leave him out there.

47:07.040 --> 47:09.327
Help! Help me!

47:12.680 --> 47:15.126
Somebody help me!

47:15.760 --> 47:16.761
I gotta save him.

47:17.960 --> 47:20.691
Are you crazy?
Those Panzers are 200 yards away.

47:20.840 --> 47:21.880
You'll never make it back.

47:22.400 --> 47:25.802
I'll make it back.
I made a promise
I have to keep.

47:26.000 --> 47:29.243
You getting killed ain't gonna
help anyone but the Germans.

47:33.480 --> 47:35.482
Help me! Please!

47:36.640 --> 47:38.051
Oh, my God!

47:40.560 --> 47:42.767
Can somebody help me?

47:48.440 --> 47:49.487
Oh, shit.

47:56.160 --> 47:57.969
Put your arms around my neck.

48:04.360 --> 48:06.966
I gotta get back.
I gotta get back to Ruth.

48:23.120 --> 48:25.600
That was goddamn crazy,
Levinson.
Do you know that?

48:29.160 --> 48:30.400
Shit!

48:38.800 --> 48:40.643
I'm very sorry.

49:26.600 --> 49:29.843
<i>When I came back from the war,
I wasn't the same.</i>

49:30.800 --> 49:33.451
<i>I was fighting
a bigger battle now.</i>

49:33.600 --> 49:37.207
<i>And I couldn't honor the
promise I had made to you.</i>

49:50.520 --> 49:52.682
Your mother says you've
been home since Monday.

49:59.520 --> 50:01.520
I can't pretend to know
what you've been through...

50:01.600 --> 50:03.409
but I want to help.

50:15.080 --> 50:17.447
Don't you think
I deserve an explanation?

50:21.760 --> 50:23.364
Well...

50:23.520 --> 50:25.090
I do.

50:39.920 --> 50:41.888
You don't understand.
It wasn't the injury itself.

50:42.040 --> 50:43.724
The wound got infected.

50:43.880 --> 50:45.564
I ran a high fever
for almost two weeks.

50:45.720 --> 50:48.121
You need to see more doctors.
Get a second opinion.

50:48.280 --> 50:50.442
Don't you think
I've already done that?

50:50.600 --> 50:52.887
There's nothing
they can do.

50:54.640 --> 50:56.404
This is my life,
I have to accept it.

50:56.480 --> 50:57.481
But I don't want it
to be yours.

50:57.640 --> 50:59.165
But there is still a chance.

50:59.320 --> 51:01.209
I want to marry you.

51:01.360 --> 51:03.283
If you marry me,
you may never have a family.

51:04.600 --> 51:07.001
Are you honestly willing
to give that up?

51:36.640 --> 51:38.290
<i>The war was over...</i>

51:39.240 --> 51:41.004
<i>and as far as I
was concerned...</i>

51:41.600 --> 51:44.171
<i>so was my life.</i>

51:49.520 --> 51:50.760
We're closed!

51:53.600 --> 51:55.045
I know what you're doing!

51:55.200 --> 51:57.248
You cannot tell me
what I'm willing to give up!

51:59.200 --> 52:00.326
When you went to war...

52:00.480 --> 52:03.484
I was here,
clinging to the hope...

52:03.760 --> 52:06.445
that you would come home
and we would get married.

52:07.280 --> 52:09.851
Yes, and have kids.
But that's a dream, Ira.

52:11.680 --> 52:13.284
You're real.

52:13.480 --> 52:14.920
I don't know what
the future holds...

52:15.040 --> 52:17.327
but I know there's
no future without you.

52:21.560 --> 52:24.404
Unless you don't
love me anymore.

53:06.360 --> 53:08.203
<i>And in that moment...</i>

53:08.360 --> 53:10.169
<i>we both knew...</i>

53:10.480 --> 53:15.930
<i>a chance at life together was
greater than the risk of being apart.</i>

53:27.040 --> 53:29.407
It was really nice of you
to bring that photo.

53:30.680 --> 53:32.808
He sure has been
through a lot.

53:32.920 --> 53:33.921
Yeah.

53:36.880 --> 53:37.881
Uh...

53:37.960 --> 53:39.803
Well, you take it easy.

53:41.560 --> 53:42.561
Luke.

53:49.240 --> 53:51.049
It was really good
to see you.

53:56.680 --> 53:58.762
What are you doing
right now?

54:01.080 --> 54:02.366
That looks good.

54:02.520 --> 54:03.567
Yeah.

54:03.640 --> 54:05.404
- I'm ready.
- All right.

54:05.560 --> 54:07.244
I'm so ready.

54:07.400 --> 54:08.600
I'll give you
the little stick.

54:08.720 --> 54:09.801
Thank you.
Yeah.

54:10.160 --> 54:11.810
Ladies first.

54:12.600 --> 54:16.446
I'm still getting used to
your Southern gentlemanly ways.

54:16.600 --> 54:18.523
I'm still trying
to impress you.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.604
It's kind of working.

54:21.760 --> 54:23.444
A little.
Mmm...

54:23.520 --> 54:25.682
Just don't let me win.

54:25.840 --> 54:28.047
I enjoy good,
healthy competition.

54:28.160 --> 54:29.161
Noted.

54:37.520 --> 54:38.760
What are you doing?

54:38.960 --> 54:40.564
You told me not
to let you win.

54:41.200 --> 54:44.921
So I'm going with plan B.
Distraction.

54:45.000 --> 54:46.286
Hmm.

54:46.360 --> 54:47.805
Mmm-hmm.

54:53.720 --> 54:54.721
Yes!

54:54.880 --> 54:56.882
Yes! Sorry!

54:57.200 --> 54:58.720
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you very much.

54:59.040 --> 55:01.407
Oh, I love mac and cheese.

55:01.600 --> 55:02.931
Comfort food?

55:03.080 --> 55:04.081
Yeah.

55:05.080 --> 55:06.286
What's your comfort food?

55:08.720 --> 55:10.404
Kolduny.

55:10.560 --> 55:11.561
Kol-what?
Kolduny.

55:11.960 --> 55:13.883
They're these super,
super delicious...

55:14.000 --> 55:16.571
Polish meat dumplings
that my mom makes.

55:17.160 --> 55:18.400
We serve them
at the diner...

55:18.560 --> 55:21.404
and I promise you,
with one bite of those...

55:21.560 --> 55:23.200
it would put your mac
and cheese to shame.

55:23.280 --> 55:24.805
Is that an invitation?

55:26.760 --> 55:27.921
Maybe.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.286
Oh. No, no.
Help yourself.

55:30.400 --> 55:31.401
No!
Yeah.

55:31.480 --> 55:33.084
Just a bite.

55:33.600 --> 55:34.965
When did your parents
come to the States?

55:35.120 --> 55:36.645
Uh, before I was born.

55:37.520 --> 55:39.443
That's crazy.
I couldn't have done that.

55:39.600 --> 55:41.523
Really?
No.

55:41.680 --> 55:44.081
You ride bulls for a living.
You could do anything.

55:44.440 --> 55:47.125
Riding bulls has got nothing
on moving clear across the world.

55:47.320 --> 55:48.606
What?
Yeah.

55:48.760 --> 55:50.683
Your parents had to
adjust their whole life.

55:50.840 --> 55:53.491
No, they didn't
adjust anything.

55:54.360 --> 55:56.840
Growing up with
immigrant parents,

55:56.920 --> 55:58.888
my life was always
really different.

55:59.040 --> 56:01.361
Everyone was always
screaming in weird languages...

56:01.520 --> 56:03.966
I brought smelly,
strange snacks to school.

56:04.120 --> 56:06.964
My pants were
too short always.

56:07.360 --> 56:08.400
Pants still are too short.

56:09.120 --> 56:11.282
Growing up on a cattle ranch,
everybody I knew was the same.

56:11.440 --> 56:15.684
Everybody you know is fourth
generation cattle ranchers.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.048
I'm jealous.
Why?

56:18.200 --> 56:20.680
I wanted to be like everyone
else when I was little.

56:22.040 --> 56:26.409
The reason I like you is because
you're nothing like everyone else.

56:29.520 --> 56:31.807
You're not so bad yourself.

56:33.960 --> 56:37.885
I think before I met you,
the closest thing I came
to cattle was...

56:37.960 --> 56:38.960
steak.

56:39.040 --> 56:41.566
Steak? Time to get you
on a bull, then.

56:41.720 --> 56:42.801
A bull?
Yeah.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.081
No way!

56:44.400 --> 56:45.447
One bull, one time.

56:45.520 --> 56:48.171
No! How about one horse,
one time?

56:48.840 --> 56:49.887
We could do that.

56:50.040 --> 56:51.644
Next week.
Okay.

56:54.440 --> 56:56.886
Ooh. I've got an idea.
Uh-oh.

56:57.200 --> 56:58.406
It's so good.
What?

56:58.600 --> 57:00.329
So good! Come on!

57:00.520 --> 57:01.851
What?
Where am I going?

57:02.000 --> 57:04.321
Where are we going?
You'll see.

57:04.520 --> 57:06.568
After you.
Wow. Thank you.

57:08.160 --> 57:09.571
Ready?

57:11.720 --> 57:13.324
Crazy face.
Yeah.

57:39.880 --> 57:42.042
Yeah, that looks good.

57:43.320 --> 57:44.367
Thank you.

57:44.480 --> 57:46.130
<i>Two hearts fading</i>

57:46.760 --> 57:48.967
<i>Like a flower</i>

57:49.200 --> 57:50.201
Okay.

57:50.320 --> 57:51.606
<i>And all this waiting</i>

57:51.680 --> 57:52.761
There you go.
Whoa.

57:52.960 --> 57:54.883
<i>For the power</i>

57:55.000 --> 57:56.570
Put your feet in.
Grab the reins.

57:56.640 --> 57:58.244
<i>For some answer</i>

57:59.120 --> 58:00.884
<i>To this fire</i>

58:02.080 --> 58:04.287
<i>Sinking slowly</i>

58:04.880 --> 58:06.530
You ready?
Yeah.

58:06.680 --> 58:08.569
Pull back on those reins.

58:08.720 --> 58:09.960
Come on.

58:11.400 --> 58:13.402
Hey, there we go!

58:13.560 --> 58:16.530
Oh, whoa,
we're going backwards!
This is awesome!

58:16.720 --> 58:18.880
Yeah, there you go,
just like that.
Lay your hands down.

58:18.920 --> 58:19.921
Okay.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.367
<i>With no secrets</i>

58:23.920 --> 58:26.082
<i>No obsession</i>

58:26.360 --> 58:28.044
How are you doing that?

58:28.200 --> 58:29.611
Why am I bouncing so much?

58:30.080 --> 58:31.969
Ease up on those
reins a little bit.

58:32.120 --> 58:33.326
All right.

58:33.400 --> 58:35.801
<i>Without a reason</i>

58:36.120 --> 58:38.088
<i>What is this fire?</i>

58:39.440 --> 58:41.647
<i>Burning slowly</i>

58:42.320 --> 58:46.120
<i>My one and only</i>

58:46.600 --> 58:48.284
Atta girl!

58:48.440 --> 58:50.249
I don't think you
can keep up with me!

58:52.680 --> 58:54.682
<i>Desire</i>

58:55.760 --> 58:57.285
<i>Desire</i>

58:58.920 --> 59:00.445
<i>Desire</i>

59:01.960 --> 59:03.689
<i>Desire</i>

59:05.840 --> 59:06.966
You know,
I have to admit

59:07.040 --> 59:09.247
you're pretty good
on a horse.

59:09.440 --> 59:10.646
Well, thank you.

59:14.320 --> 59:15.810
But I don't know...

59:15.960 --> 59:18.327
I bet you couldn't
beat me to the barn.

59:18.480 --> 59:19.970
Oh, I wouldn't go that way!
Whoa!

59:20.280 --> 59:21.281
Oh!

59:22.800 --> 59:24.006
Oh, my God!

59:26.120 --> 59:27.770
Oh, my God!

59:30.160 --> 59:31.810
Come here.

59:32.120 --> 59:33.360
I tried to tell you.

59:33.520 --> 59:35.010
I know you did.

59:37.320 --> 59:39.482
Well, this is, um...
This is home.

59:39.680 --> 59:41.967
Wow. This is nice.

59:42.480 --> 59:44.164
Really nice.
Yeah.

59:44.320 --> 59:46.163
Oh, the shower's
right in there,

59:46.320 --> 59:48.049
and there should be towels
and everything.

59:48.200 --> 59:49.201
Okay.

59:50.680 --> 59:52.011
Hey, uh, Sophia?

59:52.160 --> 59:54.367
Did you want soup?

59:54.920 --> 59:56.365
Oh, you make soup, too?

59:58.600 --> 01:00:00.125
Kind of.

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.209
Soup, soup, soup...

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.124
Oh, my God.

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.281
Come on.

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:56.491
There you go.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.486
Put your hands right here.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.645
The goal's pretty simple.

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.600
All you gotta do
is hang on for eight seconds.

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.606
Wow!

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.250
There's nothing to it.

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.641
Yeah, some bulls
are nice like that.

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.251
This is...
Yeah, okay.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.970
Excuse us, sorry.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:26.721
Sorry.

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:39.523
So how do you know
which one you're gonna get?

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:40.841
You don't.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.684
<i>You pick from a bowl.</i>

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:46.606
<i>And the fan favorite from Walkertown,
North Carolina...</i>

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:48.808
<i>Luke Collins!</i>

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:51.850
<i>Number four is the chip
you selected...</i>

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.764
<i>and that is Gunpowder
and Lead, Luke.</i>

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.689
<i>Jared Middleton reaching in...</i>

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.604
<i>and pulling out chip
number two.</i>

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:00.683
<i>You have Asteroid.</i>

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.321
Whoa... Whoa!

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.603
That's impossible!
Yeah!

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.400
You can only touch
with your riding hand.

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.005
All other touching's
against the rules.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.969
Okay. I got it.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:21.841
Let's go!

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:49.085
If you are off balance even a little,
you lose points.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.924
<i>But if you control the bull,
you get style points.</i>

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:57.043
Is that how you do
the hand? That?

01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:58.687
More or less.

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:11.445
The bull is judged too,
on speed, agility and power.

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:14.763
<i>Whether it bucks or blows out,
turns back around on you.</i>

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:29.521
Yeah!

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:46.731
Some bulls are just
plain mean.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:48.121
And others...

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.570
<i>Others are monsters.</i>

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.969
Let's brave the storm.

01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.321
Let's do it.

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:13.010
This is certainly better
than the hospital, isn't it?

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.320
How are you feeling?

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.960
The better question is,
how do I look?

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:24.251
Very handsome.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.010
All I care about.

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.250
Hold on one second.

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:30.361
Hello?

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:31.646
<i>Hi, Sophia. This is Adrienne.</i>

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.006
Hi, Ms. Francis.

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:35.481
<i>My client has an exhibit
in Charlotte next weekend.</i>

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:36.687
<i>Can you be there?</i>

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.330
Yeah, I'd love to.
That sounds great.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:39.720
<i>This could be
a real opportunity for us.</i>

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:40.800
Okay.

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:41.921
<i>I'll email you the details.</i>

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.087
Okay. All right,
I'll talk to you soon.

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.160
<i>Bye, Sophia.</i>

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.201
Thanks, bye.

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:47.647
Good news?

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.040
Yeah.

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:50.081
Um...

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:52.600
The woman I'm working for
this summer...

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:54.887
she has a client with an
art exhibit in Charlotte...

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:56.451
and wants me
to help her out.

01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:58.529
I didn't know you had
an interest in art.

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:01.166
Only since I was,
like, five.

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.721
Ruth also loved art.
Yeah.

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:07.566
Yeah, I remember the story
with the painting in the hotel lobby.

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:11.043
You've heard of
Black Mountain College?

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:15.246
I'm doing my senior
thesis on it right now.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.164
That's where
I was headed...

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.527
when I got in that fight
with the guardrail.

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.563
Are you sure this is how
you want to spend your honeymoon?

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:26.640
Oh, I promise you're going
to love it, I promise!

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.326
I'd rather we'd just
stayed in bed.

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:52.242
<i>You weren't able to engage
your passion for contemporary art...</i>

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:53.771
<i>In our little town...</i>

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.287
<i>so Black Mountain College
was a godsend.</i>

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.762
It's so amazing!

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:12.048
Really look at your
work to understand it.

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:14.965
But I want to be able to
control the accidents...

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:17.043
and not leave them to fate...

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.248
or the Lord or chance,
whatever you want to call it.

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.250
I teach you to see.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:25.131
Then even an accident
will have purpose...

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:28.049
and direction.

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:35.723
Oh, I love it!

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:37.968
For over 500 years,
artists have been reproducing...

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:40.088
quite literally what
they see in front of them.

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:43.250
Then Kandinsky came
and broke all the rules,
all of them!

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:46.929
Sorry.

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:48.884
I love it!

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.844
I can't believe we met
Josef Albers today.

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:07.682
It's just a bit further.

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.450
You all right?

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.250
Oh!

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.326
You ready?

01:08:19.479 --> 01:08:20.527
Yeah.

01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:25.966
You like it?

01:08:27.439 --> 01:08:29.283
<i>From one happy day
to the next...</i>

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:30.361
You said you
love the house, right?

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:34.001
<i>We began the process
of creating a life together.</i>

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.161
Doesn't look like
anyone's home.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.368
No, I don't think
you should go in.

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.680
Ira!
What?

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.723
Well, let's just
use the key.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.207
No! Oh, my God!

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.051
You wonderful person!

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.439
Wait, wait, wait.
Come here.

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:53.366
Yeah, there.

01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:57.680
No.

01:08:58.479 --> 01:08:59.481
There.

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:06.566
There! First thing you see
when you come in!

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.563
<i>Life was busy
and happy for us.</i>

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:12.084
<i>I took over my dad's
booming business...</i>

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:15.323
<i>and you found a job
teaching at the local school.</i>

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:17.245
Who understands this, huh?

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:18.560
Oh! Look at this!

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:21.484
You're all on your way
to becoming math geniuses.

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.563
Solve the problems
on the board.

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:26.206
If you have any questions,
please ask.

01:09:26.359 --> 01:09:29.011
Wow, it sounds like
you made her very happy.

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:31.571
I did.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.443
For a while.

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:38.523
His first cowboy hat.

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:40.170
That is so cute!

01:09:40.279 --> 01:09:41.281
Never took it off.

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:42.926
He ate in it.

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:44.286
He slept in it.

01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:46.602
He even tried to glue it
to his head so it
wouldn't come off!

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:47.886
Mom!

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.087
What?

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:53.131
He broke his arm riding
a calf when he was seven.

01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:56.250
I found him sneaking into
the barn at night to practice...

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.687
hanging on with his
non-cast arm.

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:01.320
Even then, I couldn't get him
to stop riding
when he shouldn't.

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:06.245
Hey. There you go.

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.084
Thank you.

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:09.401
Sweet.

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.882
That's Luke's dad, Jack.

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:17.485
- He was a great man.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:19.290
Great rider, too.

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.888
Even if you stop now,
you'd still have a
better career than he had.

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.286
What happened?

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:30.564
He died of a heart attack.

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:32.609
Yeah, almost five years
ago now.

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.921
How about a little dessert?

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:40.731
Luke, wait till you see
what I made for you.

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:43.446
Sophia, it's worth
the calories.

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:48.281
No.

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:56.881
How come your mom keeps
talking about you giving up riding?

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:01.530
She's just being
an overprotective mom.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.684
How bad did you get hurt?

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:05.841
Sophia...
No.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.809
I know all riders
are bound to get hurt.

01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:09.803
It's not a matter of
"if" but "when."

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:11.007
That's right.

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.240
They say all bull riders
are either stupid or crazy.

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.124
Yeah, and which one
are you?

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:20.530
I don't know.
I guess a little of both.

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.406
What are you doing?

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:26.406
This is a new painting by an
artist that Adrienne Francis represents.

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:29.042
You know, the woman
I'm interning for?

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:31.043
$80 grand, really?

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:33.600
A lot of people
think he's a genius.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.729
Yeah,
he most certainly is...

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:39.009
getting people to fork
over $80 grand for that.

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:46.040
Are you sure that you wanna
go to this gallery showing in Charlotte?

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:47.770
You want me to, right?

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:48.841
Of course.

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:50.571
Then I'll be there.

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.609
Yeah, but you're riding
that afternoon.

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:54.410
I'll be there.

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:11.446
Wow! Don't you
look nice!

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:14.641
Never seen you in a
coat and tie before.

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:17.371
Yeah, doesn't happen
too often.

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:21.449
Oh, that's my boss,
Adrienne Francis.

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:22.601
I gotta go. Okay?

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:24.569
Yeah. Go.

01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:28.600
Hi. Sophia.
Nice to meet you.

01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:31.160
Hopefully, Sophia will be
joining me in New York,
and my team.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.723
You usually find these sort of things
in process art or lenticular prints...

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:40.451
but it's very rare
in brushwork.

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:43.327
That is what makes
this piece so special.

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.802
If you have any questions,
let me know. Thank you.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:11.040
Excuse me.

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.201
Just one second.

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.760
It'll be worth
twice that a year from now.

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.962
At $20,000, it's a steal.

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:21.605
- Sure.
- Good.

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:22.807
Do you wanna get it?

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.490
Let's do it.
Okay.

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:35.485
I'll fly you to New York.
See the space, meet the team.

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:36.561
Yes!

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.120
These are some
very important people.

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:40.561
So if you can't do it,
don't say yes.
No...

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:42.480
I know you have finals
and other commitments.

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:45.729
I'd love to.
This is the most important
thing to me.

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:47.681
Oh! Uh, Luke, hi.

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.888
This is Adrienne Francis.

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.849
Adrienne, this is
my boyfriend, Luke.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.080
Nice to meet you,
Ms. Francis.
Nice to meet you, Luke.

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:56.004
Are you in college
with Sophia?

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.645
No, never made it
to college.

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:58.847
Luke's a professional
bull rider.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.526
I've never met a professional
bull rider before.

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:03.682
Probably not too many
in Manhattan.

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:07.366
Are you an art lover,
like Sophia?

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.204
No, I can't say that I am.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.250
What did you think
of tonight?

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:14.321
Honestly?

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:16.406
Of course.

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:20.280
I think there's more bullshit
here than where I work.

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:35.401
I like him. Keep this one.

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.888
How could you
say that to her?

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:46.045
It was a joke.

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:48.407
To the woman
who's gonna be my boss?

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:50.528
To the woman who I hope
is gonna launch my career?

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:52.603
That lady? Come on.
No, you come on.

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:56.089
You know how hard I have
just tried to fit into your world.

01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:57.600
Why can't you try to
fit into mine?

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:58.921
I do!

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.562
It was a joke, okay?
She thought it was funny.

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.245
She laughed.
You don't know that.

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:06.209
What if she was just trying
to be polite?

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.610
Does this make sense?

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:10.081
What?

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:11.810
How are we gonna
make this work, huh?

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.160
Do you really see yourself
living on a ranch?

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:15.884
Working a ranch
the rest of your life?

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:18.963
And what am I gonna do?

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:21.603
Move to Manhattan?

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:23.560
Go out with your artist friends?
Go to brunch?

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:25.130
Talk about squiggly lines
on a white canvas...

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:26.770
like they're more than squiggly
lineson a white canvas?

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:29.969
I know all of that,
I do. I get it.

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:44.641
I just...

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:48.807
I just don't know
how to make this work.

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.128
I don't know either.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.082
But I know that I want to.

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:18.003
Are we just crazy?

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:21.691
Do you think it could
work between us?

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:25.643
We just come from
such different worlds.

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:31.004
But I've never felt this way
about anybody before.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:33.529
Not everybody gets that.

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:36.045
You did.

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:40.321
It wasn't that simple.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.845
<i>As the years went by...</i>

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.527
<i>I could see how much
she wanted to start a family.</i>

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.842
<i>We tried to adopt.</i>

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:56.520
<i>But it wasn't so easy
back then.</i>

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.246
Now, today we're
going to learn...

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.800
about my favorite...

01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:29.291
book.

01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:31.886
<i>It's called Pippi Longstocking.</i>

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:54.929
If anyone
teases him about this,

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.889
they'll have me to deal with.

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:14.724
Good morning.

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:21.811
Hello.

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:25.282
My name is Ruth Levinson.
I'm Daniel's teacher.

01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:29.446
I came here because
I'm slightly concerned.

01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:30.971
He's falling asleep in class.

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:32.690
<i>We were
surprised to learn...</i>

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:37.448
<i>that Daniel McDonald was being
raised by a half-brother and his wife.</i>

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:39.921
<i>Neither seemed to care
if he ate or starved.</i>

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:43.084
He's a very bright boy.

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:44.327
Infinite potential.

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:47.809
Maybe I could tutor him
after class?

01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:48.927
All right.

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:50.966
Yes?

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:38.210
Are you a wolf?

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:40.401
No, ma'am.

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:44.285
Are you a bear?

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:45.361
No, ma'am.

01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:47.121
Oh.

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:49.528
Are you a boy?

01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:51.211
Yes, ma'am.

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:54.884
Boys use knives and forks.

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:06.891
Oh. Almost.

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:09.880
Yeah. Okay.

01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:12.884
What star is that?

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.883
The North Star, Polaris.

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:16.764
Good. Look.

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:21.811
"That was because
she didn't want to

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:23.251
"turn around to get home.

01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:27.086
"When she reached
Tommy's and Annika's gate,
she stopped.

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:34.444
<i>Pretty soon,
the tutoring was every day.</i>

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:36.085
<i>And sometimes he
stayed for dinner.</i>

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:52.489
<i>We never said he was the child
we could never have...</i>

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:54.843
<i>but even so...</i>

01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:06.530
What do you think?

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:09.843
She's making her son dinner.
Right?

01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:11.561
Yeah.

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:19.964
I hate taking him back there.
Why can't we adopt him?

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:21.121
Because they're his
legal guardians.

01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:22.240
There's nothing we can do.

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:23.281
Did you speak
to the lawyer?

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:25.089
I did, and
that's what he said.

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:28.006
They don't care about him.
They don't!

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:29.685
They're his next of kin
and they're proud people.

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:31.080
They're not gonna let us
take Daniel away.

01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:33.328
There must be
something more we can do.

01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:42.681
Ruth?

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.126
We better go.

01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:30.925
You be good.
Okay, pal?

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.206
Okay.

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:36.087
Maybe I'll raise chickens...

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:37.765
or work at the factory.

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:39.524
If that's what you want.

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:42.041
You can be anything you want,
Daniel McDonald.

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:46.167
Anything at all.
A farmer, a lawyer,
an astronomer.

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:49.960
You're a very clever boy.

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:52.609
You really think so?
Yeah!

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.331
I know so.

01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:57.890
All right, come on.

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:05.681
Okay.

01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:07.046
I'm just saying goodbye.

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.127
You can't stop me!

01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:11.123
I'm just saying goodbye!

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.360
I know you are, sweetheart.
Let's go back to the car.

01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:15.800
There's nothing we can do.
There's nothing we can do.

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:17.803
Please reconsider.
Please reconsider!

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:19.000
There's nothing we can do.

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.565
He deserves
better than this.

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:22.731
Sweetheart,
get in the car.

01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:24.405
They don't care about him.
I know they don't.

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:26.602
They don't care about him!

01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:38.487
Ruth.

01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:42.281
Ruth.

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:48.525
What was I supposed to do?

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.365
Fight for custody.

01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:58.444
From a half-brother
in small-town North Carolina?

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:01.202
Come on. We wouldn't have
had a chance!

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:03.807
And who knows what they
would've done to Daniel.

01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:07.803
We were a family.

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:15.402
We are a family.

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:22.246
Ruth, you are my family.

01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:41.404
I wanted kids too, you know.

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:54.411
We never saw Daniel again.

01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.410
Oh, my God.

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:55.401
Oh, shit.

01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:05.562
<i>Luke Collins
is trying to come around.</i>

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.925
<i>The bull fighter's taking the
bull away in the other direction.</i>

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:13.244
<i>I think he's gonna be okay.
He's trying to get up. He is!</i>

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:16.165
<i>Let me get him something to make
him feel a little bit better.</i>

01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:18.971
<i>92 points!</i>

01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:20.610
<i>264 on three bulls!</i>

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:22.762
<i>Luke Collins is
your clear-cut winner.</i>

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:28.487
He's awesome.

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:31.723
<i>...number nine spot
in the world.</i>

01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:38.450
Are you okay, Luke?

01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:42.449
I'm fine.

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:45.881
All right.

01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:48.486
Have an amazing time in New York.
Yes, I will.

01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:50.530
You impressed Adrienne,
you'll impress her team.

01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:51.687
Okay. Gotta go.

01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:53.290
This is what you've always wanted!
I know!

01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:54.965
Bye! See you on Monday.

01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:59.489
Hey, babe.
I'm walking to the taxi right now.

01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:01.483
<i>Sophia, it's Luiz.</i>

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:03.369
Hi, Luiz.
<i>Something's happened to Luke.</i>

01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:09.841
Hi, can I help you?

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.162
Um, I need to see
my boyfriend, Luke Collins.

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:14.607
He came in an ambulance earlier.
I need to see him.

01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:17.001
I'm sorry.
Only family can visit.

01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:20.009
Okay. Can I at least know
how he is?

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:24.123
His condition is stable,
but he's getting an MRI.

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:25.280
He took a pretty hard fall.

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:28.689
If you wanna take a seat,
I'll check with the doctor.

01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:30.330
I'll let you know.

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:33.166
Thank you.

01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:40.490
So, are you light-headed,
dizzy?

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:42.850
Nausea?

01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:50.689
I'd like you to stay
overnight for observation.

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:53.964
Sweetie. What are you
doing here?

01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:57.045
I came as soon as I heard.

01:27:58.040 --> 01:27:59.041
Aren't you supposed to
be in New York?

01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:00.805
No, no.

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:02.361
I should be here.

01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:06.370
Thank God you're okay.

01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:07.520
I'm fine.

01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:09.528
You're lucky to be alive,
is what you are.

01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:11.521
What?

01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:13.210
I just got a little dizzy,
that's all.

01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:14.481
Luke,

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:17.046
you need to stop downplaying
the severity of your condition.

01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:21.409
If you care about your friend,
you need to make him understand...

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:22.846
that his riding days
are over.

01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:31.767
What is he talking about?

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:37.250
I'm tired, okay?

01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:39.562
Can we just talk
about it tomorrow?

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:44.004
Ms. Francis,
I am so sorry about all of this.

01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:45.081
<i>Please, Sophia.</i>

01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:48.482
<i>I understand you can't meet
the team this weekend,
given the circumstances.</i>

01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:50.244
<i>And I do hope Luke is okay.</i>

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:52.368
Yeah, me, too.

01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:58.611
I don't know when
I'm gonna be able to come to New York.

01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:00.762
<i>Oh, really?</i>

01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:04.084
<i>Wait a minute.
You're not rethinking
the internship, are you?</i>

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:06.931
<i>Look, Sophia.</i>

01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:08.764
<i>I think you have a bright
future ahead of you...</i>

01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:12.083
<i>but you're going to have to figure
out for yourself what that's going to be.</i>

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:13.884
I know.

01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:30.609
<i>World Finals
qualifier from Walkertown,
North Carolina.</i>

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:32.131
<i>Luke Collins!</i>

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:35.450
<i>And he is ready
to rock and roll!</i>

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:36.601
Let's go!

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:40.048
<i>Luke Collins outside
in the middle, rocked over!</i>

01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:42.282
<i>He is just... Wow!</i>

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:53.321
<i>A double flip somersault
face-plant into the dirt.</i>

01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:57.920
<i>You've gotta get him
out of there!</i>

01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:02.045
<i>Yeah,
no doubt about it.</i>

01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:04.600
<i>He took a devastating shot
right there...</i>

01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:07.764
<i>by one of the PBR's best.</i>

01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:10.406
<i>Our sports medicine team
are coming in right now...</i>

01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:13.404
<i>to take care of the young man
from North Carolina.</i>

01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:15.280
<i>Talk about your scary moments.</i>

01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:18.290
<i>The degree of difficulty here
is impossible to calculate.</i>

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:21.605
<i>The official buck-off time,
4.7 seconds.</i>

01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:24.286
<i>Right now,
our medical staff is attending.</i>

01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:35.761
That's fine, right here.

01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:38.002
No. It's fine, please.
Thanks.

01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:40.485
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:42.841
I'll take the bag.

01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:44.371
No, I got it.

01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:13.407
Thank you.

01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:16.050
Luke...

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:20.370
I'm really sorry.

01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:25.802
I know how hard it must be to
give up that whole part of your life.

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:31.880
You're kidding, right?

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.001
Sophia...

01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:34.923
You heard the doctors.

01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:36.366
Doctors don't know
everything.

01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:37.567
Are you crazy?

01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:39.250
I watched what happened
to you on YouTube.

01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:41.050
You were in a coma
for 10 days.

01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:43.851
I told you, every time
a rider gets in that chute,
he could die.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.606
That's bullshit!
Your situation is different!

01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:53.084
You have to quit!

01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:55.322
You have to!
I can't!

01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:57.960
I can't be with someone if every
time they walk out the door...

01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.445
I don't know if I'm gonna
see them again!

01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:00.561
Then that's your choice.

01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:02.643
Yeah, I chose you!
I chose you over New York!

01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:07.811
Over my internship.
I chose you over everything.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.240
I didn't ask you
to change your life.

01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:11.323
You can't expect me
to change mine.

01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:17.122
This is what I do.

01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:20.962
It's all I know.

01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:25.844
This is my life.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.526
I thought this was
our life.

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:32.248
I can't watch you ruin it.

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:54.407
Hi.

01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:56.608
Right upstairs.
Thanks.

01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:03.731
How was...

01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:08.363
How was New York?

01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:12.606
I never made it.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.571
And I broke up
with Luke anyway.

01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:20.366
I'm really sorry.
Come here.

01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:21.806
Come here.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.764
How can I help?

01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:38.847
Take my mind off of it.

01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:43.566
What happened
after that fight over Daniel?

01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:46.730
Are you sure you don't wanna
talk about you and Luke?

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:47.881
Mmm.

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:50.769
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:56.043
It's a scary thing.

01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:00.330
How the people
you're closest to...

01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:03.287
can so quickly become...

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:05.644
strangers.

01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:36.090
I can't do this anymore.

01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:42.206
I'm going crazy.

01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:48.966
I know it's not your fault.

01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:53.290
I have to go.

01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:39.642
No, please don't!
I just need to say something.

01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:41.930
I need to say something.

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:50.410
I fell in love with you
the first time I saw you.

01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:52.688
You're just the most amazing,
beautiful girl I ever met...

01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:53.921
and somehow...

01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:56.731
I don't know,
somehow you chose me.

01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:01.927
But howl loved you then...

01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:04.560
it's nothing compared to
how I love you now.

01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:09.850
Now, I love you with
everything inside of me.

01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:12.324
I think you should go.

01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:19.248
I love you so much,
I just want you to be happy.

01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:23.930
Even if that happiness
no longer includes me.

01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:07.490
Love requires sacrifice.

01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:12.531
Always.

01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:19.210
<i>And from that day on,
Sophia,</i>

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:23.801
<i>it wasn't exactly happily ever after,
but it was pretty close.</i>

01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:29.166
<i>We focused on celebrating all the
wonderful things we had...</i>

01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:32.000
<i>rather than regretting
the things we didn't.</i>

01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:35.767
<i>Every anniversary,
we would drive to Black Mountain.</i>

01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:39.765
<i>I still wrote Ruth letters...</i>

01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:42.002
<i>even though I saw her
every day.</i>

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:52.885
Ruthie.

01:38:57.200 --> 01:38:58.201
Ruth.

01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:27.884
<i>So many wonderful years.</i>

01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:31.206
<i>But, of course,
not nearly enough.</i>

01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:47.321
<i>The paintings
Ruth and I had collected...</i>

01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:51.601
<i>only served as a reminder
of what I had lost.</i>

01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:55.361
<i>So I packed them away.</i>

01:39:57.920 --> 01:39:59.285
Can I help you?

01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:00.930
My name is
Andrea McDonald.

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:03.642
I believe you knew
my husband...

01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:06.404
Daniel McDonald?

01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:13.687
He collapsed in his classroom
early one morning before school.

01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:16.161
A brain aneurysm.

01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:18.761
That was six years ago.

01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:22.841
I'm very sorry to hear that.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.331
Thank you.

01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:28.007
He was a teacher?

01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:30.489
A professor.

01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:33.371
Physics and astronomy
at the University College London.

01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:35.330
Astronomy.

01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:38.609
I moved back to the States
a few years ago.

01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:41.608
When I saw your wife's
obituary in the paper...

01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:43.290
I knew I had to
bring you this.

01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:51.130
It meant a lot to him.

01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:51.370
You did everything you could
with Luke, Sophia.

01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:54.164
You sacrificed.

01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:58.242
I have loved
spending time with you.

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:02.048
You've made me very happy.

01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:27.247
What are you doing up
so late?

01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:30.410
I won tonight.

01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:32.724
Puts me fifth in the world.

01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:38.640
Are you really gonna
start on me now?

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:40.601
No.

01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:44.244
The mistakes you make
are your own.

01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:46.568
Mistake? Jesus, Mom!

01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:50.809
These risks you're taking...

01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:52.200
I don't know why.

01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:54.761
I'm just trying to keep
this ranch in the family.

01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:55.887
For you.

01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:00.966
For me?

01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:02.127
Yeah.

01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:03.611
This isn't about me.

01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:05.971
Where are you gonna live?

01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:07.929
If we don't have this place,
where are you gonna go?

01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:11.243
Do you honestly think
I give a damn?

01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:17.767
You're doing this
for yourself.

01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:26.964
It's eight seconds.

01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:29.649
That's all it is.

01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:33.771
That girl could be
the rest of your life.

01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:07.126
<i>Sophia Danko?</i>

01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:09.169
Uh, yes. This is she.

01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:13.530
<i>My name is Howie Sanders.
I'm the attorney for Ira Levinson.</i>

01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:15.688
<i>I've been trying to reach you.</i>

01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:19.202
Uh, yeah. What is it?
Is he okay?

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:21.889
<i>I'm sorry, Ms. Danko.</i>

01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:25.002
<i>He passed away
late last night.</i>

01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:31.725
<i>Ms. Danko?</i>

01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:34.404
<i>Are you all right?</i>

01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:35.721
Yeah.

01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:40.523
<i>Mr. Levinson's art collection is
being auctioned off next week.</i>

01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:43.684
<i>This is a private auction,
and is by invitation only.</i>

01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:46.531
<i>And Ira asked
if you would attend.</i>

01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:48.521
Yeah, of course.

01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:52.367
<i>I know this is short notice.</i>

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:55.048
<i>But it's important to know...</i>

01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:58.322
<i>he was very fond of you.</i>

01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:03.762
I was very fond of him, too.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.401
<i>Well, I'll send
all the information along.</i>

01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:12.047
<i>It was nice
to finally talk with you.</i>

01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:15.601
Thank you.

01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:29.964
<i>Tonight we're gonna be watching
the top bull riders in the world.</i>

01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:32.041
Aces.

01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:46.170
<i>This is the one and only PBR!</i>

01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:55.526
<i>Time to meet
your top 15 contenders!</i>

01:46:56.320 --> 01:47:00.848
<i>Being led out by the
number-one-ranked
bull rider in the world...</i>

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.844
<i>from Oklahoma,
Jared Middleton!</i>

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.526
<i>Boy, what a fight
it has been...</i>

01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:10.366
<i>between him and the man
from North Carolina...</i>

01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:12.170
<i>Luke Collins!</i>

01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:15.364
<i>It has been an epic battle
between those two...</i>

01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:17.727
<i>for this title!</i>

01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:21.851
<i>But don't count out men
atop that leaderboard!</i>

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.207
<i>We will now go
atop the shark cage...</i>

01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:27.523
<i>for our
championship-round draft.</i>

01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:31.082
<i>Ryan Dirteater,
you will have Smackdown.
We will see you soon.</i>

01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:34.687
<i>Now over to Billy Robinson,
the talent from Virginia.</i>

01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:37.281
<i>Billy, let's find out
what bull you will face.</i>

01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:41.729
<i>You are going to face
Bushwacker! Congratulations!</i>

01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:45.362
<i>Now to the fan favorite
from North Carolina,
Luke Collins!</i>

01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:48.040
<i>Luke, your fate
is in that cup.</i>

01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:50.771
<i>It is time for you to reach in
and pull out your bull...</i>

01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:52.729
<i>for this championship round.</i>

01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:54.484
<i>Let's see what it will be.</i>

01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:58.486
<i>Luke, you will have
the number-one contender...</i>

01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:01.041
<i>for this year's
World Champion Bucking Bull...</i>

01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:02.161
<i>Rango!</i>

01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:26.125
<i>Okay, Nashville.</i>

01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:28.248
<i>You know
who I'm talking about.</i>

01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:31.244
<i>With 99
consecutive buck-offs...</i>

01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:33.761
<i>and staring down number 100...</i>

01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:37.003
<i>this is the number-one-ranked
bucking bull in the world!</i>

01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:46.211
<i>He is doing one of the most
difficult things in sports...</i>

01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:48.806
<i>and that is
mounting a comeback.</i>

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.210
<i>Yeah, but Luke Collins,
he is on PBR fire!</i>

01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:12.361
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:49:57.240 --> 01:49:58.844
You got it! Keep riding!

01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:22.967
Yeah! Yeah!

01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:06.284
<i>We have just seen
David slay Goliath!</i>

01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:56.521
Hey, Luke, you made
the eight on Rango.

01:51:56.680 --> 01:51:58.125
I knew you were a cowboy.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.889
One hell of a ride,
son, I tell you!

01:52:01.040 --> 01:52:03.008
Luke, we gotta get together
now and talk some business.

01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:05.128
Luke?
Luke, where you going?

01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:10.163
The Levinson artwork
is the largest

01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:12.163
and most valuable
private collection.

01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:15.164
Not only are these pieces sourced
from local Black Mountain College...

01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:17.004
but the world.

01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:18.685
We'll look at contemporary
modern artists...

01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:21.684
such as Andy Warhol,
Pat Passlof,
and Willem de Kooning.

01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:24.089
These are
amazing works of art...

01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:26.368
and incredibly diverse,
as you already know.

01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:29.171
Never been seen in one place
like this before.

01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:30.765
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen

01:52:30.840 --> 01:52:33.286
for attending this
remarkable auction.

01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:35.807
If everyone could
take their seats, please.

01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:39.009
I know we are all eager
to get started.

01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:43.891
Before we begin,
a personal note.

01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:50.131
Welcome. I'm Howard Sanders.

01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:52.448
I was Ruth and Ira
Levinson's attorney...

01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:54.489
for more than 25 years.

01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:57.883
Now, Ira's will
is very detailed...

01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:00.010
on how he wants to
proceed today.

01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:03.524
So, let me start by reading
you a letter he wrote...

01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:05.600
specifically for the occasion.

01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:09.202
"My name is Ira Levinson.

01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:13.843
"I'm an ordinary man who fell in
love with an extraordinary woman.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:18.642
"Around this room you will see some
beautiful and priceless works of art.

01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:22.486
"Ruth had an incredible eye
for talent...

01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:25.086
"while I only had
eyes for her.

01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:27.721
"For me...

01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:31.680
"the great joy of collecting
wasn't in the art itself..."

01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:34.047
<i>...but in the person
I collected it with.</i>

01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:36.290
<i>My beloved Ruth.</i>

01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:40.169
<i>The happiness these paintings
brought her was immeasurable.</i>

01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:42.531
<i>And sharing that happiness...</i>

01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:45.249
<i>was the great privilege
of my life.</i>

01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:48.682
<i>We celebrated, we achieved.</i>

01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:51.724
<i>We endured, we compromised.</i>

01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:53.201
<i>And above all...</i>

01:53:53.960 --> 01:53:55.291
<i>we loved.</i>

01:53:56.280 --> 01:53:57.725
<i>The true work of art...</i>

01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:00.406
<i>was the longest ride
Ruth and I shared.</i>

01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:02.843
<i>This thing called life.</i>

01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:08.045
<i>There's not a painting here
I wouldn't trade in a heartbeat...</i>

01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:10.043
<i>to hear her voice.</i>

01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:13.443
<i>Or see her smile.</i>

01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:16.969
<i>Just one more time.</i>

01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:18.525
Signed, Ira Levinson.

01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:24.568
Thank you all for coming.

01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:31.322
Thank you, Mr. Sanders.

01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:38.041
First up, a painting located
on page 34 of your catalogues...

01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:40.487
titled <i>Portrait of Ruth.</i>

01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:49.563
Composed by American Daniel McDonald,
born 1954, died 2001.

01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:52.644
The work is circa 1963.

01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:56.011
We'll start the bidding at $1,000 for
<i>Portrait of Ruth.</i>

01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:58.646
Do I hear $1,000?

01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:01.804
Who has $1,000 for me?

01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:04.851
How about $800?
Who can give me $800?

01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:07.130
Just $800, folks.

01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:11.291
$600.

01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:14.009
Do I hear $600?

01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:19.690
Who has $600 for <i>Portrait of Ruth,</i>
the first work of the evening?

01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:21.201
$600.

01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:24.720
I have $600.
I have $600, here.

01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:26.644
Going once.

01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:29.929
I have $600. Going twice.

01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:32.441
Fair warning.

01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:35.648
Sold to the young man
right there for $600.

01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:46.251
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're going to take a short pause.

01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:49.051
We can take this time
to look at the next item...

01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:50.645
which will be a
Jackson Pollock.

01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:53.485
That's located on page 124.

01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:07.041
There we go.

01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:08.804
What are you doing here?

01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:13.883
Ira invited me.

01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:21.204
I'm done bull riding, Sophia.

01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:24.803
I'm done.

01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:29.200
Look, I drew Rango
this afternoon.

01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:33.286
I thought if I could just
ride that son of a bitch...

01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:35.727
if I could just
make the eight...

01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:37.649
I'd have everything
I ever wanted.

01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:41.161
Well, I did. I rode him.

01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:44.325
So, you're the best.

01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:46.762
No. Not even close.

01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:50.971
You see, the whole time
I was thinking about you.

01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:56.727
I realized that what I want is
standing right in front of me.

01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:18.047
What made you buy
that painting?

01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:20.601
Ira.

01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:27.721
Excuse me, sir.
We need you in the other room.

01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:30.369
Sir?
Not now.

01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:32.760
- Sir?
- Not now.

01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:34.160
Mr. Sanders needs you.

01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:44.601
Quiet! Quiet, please!

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:46.843
What is your name, son?

01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:49.051
Luke Collins.

01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:51.521
And did you just close your
purchase of <i>Portrait of Ruth?</i>

01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:53.960
Yes.

01:57:54.120 --> 01:57:56.122
Mr. Collins,
I have a stipulation...

01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:59.409
in Ira Levinson's will
I need to read to you.

01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:03.690
<i>"Portrait of Ruth</i> may not be the most
valuable painting in my collection...

01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:05.569
"but it was the most
precious to me...

01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:08.684
"because it reminded me daily
of my beloved Ruth.

01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:11.286
"And so, the terms
of my will are simple.

01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:13.323
"Whoever purchases
the portrait...

01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:16.326
"will receive the collection
in its entirety."

01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:21.363
Ladies and gentlemen,
this auction is over.

01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:22.646
What?

01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:26.043
This is worth millions.
Millions of dollars.

01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:27.680
How much do you want
for the Warhols?

01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:29.131
What are your plans
for the Jackson Pollocks?

01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:31.600
I have a client who wants to
buy both of the Picassos.

01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:34.929
I'll write you a check.

01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:39.685
Sorry.

01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:43.489
I'm gonna guess that your
head is spinning right about now.

01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:45.802
Yeah. That's a good guess.

01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:49.124
When your feet
hit the ground, call me.

01:58:50.200 --> 01:58:52.965
You are now
a very wealthy man.

01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:15.204
<i>You think you know all about
it then it seems you are wrong</i>

01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:22.404
<i>She hit it out of the park
before it had even begun</i>

01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:30.606
<i>I needed sunshine in the
