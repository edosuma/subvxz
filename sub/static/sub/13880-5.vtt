Carl:
What are you, out of your mind?

07:28.260 --> 07:30.232
You pay money for cable?

07:30.232 --> 07:32.537
[ Laughs ]

07:32.537 --> 07:34.677
All: You're stupid.

07:37.250 --> 07:38.252
Shake: You got the gun?

07:38.252 --> 07:39.255
Meatwad: I couldn't find

07:39.255 --> 07:40.893
no serial numbers to file off,

07:40.893 --> 07:44.135
so I done filed off the words
"tub and toilet."

07:44.135 --> 07:46.139
Shake:
Good idea. Is it loaded?

07:46.139 --> 07:47.443
Hey, make sure it's loaded.

07:47.443 --> 07:48.546
Meatwad: I ate some, but I think

07:48.546 --> 07:51.621
there's enough here
to do the deed.

07:51.621 --> 07:52.890
Shake: You know the guy, right?

07:52.890 --> 07:55.431
Meatwad:
Mm-hmm. This him -- Mr. Dicenzo.

07:55.431 --> 07:58.404
I go up to him, and I squirt
him up in the ear twice.

07:58.404 --> 08:01.413
Then I apologize,
and then we rich, boy!

08:01.413 --> 08:03.385
Shake: And I'll be
right here with backup.

08:03.385 --> 08:04.520
If he tries to chase you,

08:04.520 --> 08:06.526
he's gonna get a faceful of my

08:06.526 --> 08:08.598
little tangerine dart gun here.

08:08.598 --> 08:10.136
Meatwad:
Don't waste the ammo in here!

08:10.136 --> 08:12.441
- You gonna need those.
- Shake: I'm just so mad!

08:12.441 --> 08:14.580
When you got one of these
beauts in your hand,

08:14.580 --> 08:17.388
it's like you're
a god or something!

08:17.388 --> 08:19.126
[ Panting ]

08:19.126 --> 08:20.295

Come on, tough guy.
Let's take a ride.

08:45.728 --> 08:48.970
Meatwad: Frylock says I ain't
supposed to ride with strangers.

08:52.680 --> 08:54.685
But okeydokey.

08:54.685 --> 08:56.522
This is a nice car.

08:56.522 --> 08:58.027
It's pretty roomy back here,

08:58.027 --> 09:00.634

that's next to me.

And uh, this --
this right here? This the guy?

09:13.100 --> 09:16.608
Meatwad: Yep, there he is in the
window, looking all scared.

09:16.608 --> 09:18.212
Yep. He should be.

09:18.212 --> 09:19.683
Meatwad:
He's a white guy, like I said.

09:19.683 --> 09:23.259
He looks real white right now.
Oh, look.

09:23.259 --> 09:24.262
Now no one's home.

09:24.262 --> 09:25.498
Uh, okay, look. I don't want you

09:25.498 --> 09:27.403
to take this the wrong way
or anything,

09:27.403 --> 09:28.606
but I'm tired of talking to you.

09:28.606 --> 09:30.110

Yeah, we'll, uh, mail it to you.

09:37.863 --> 09:39.567
Turn around. Roll away.

10:03.129 --> 10:04.165
Frylock: Yep.

10:04.165 --> 10:06.471
I gave Carl a 12-pack,
he drank it,

10:06.471 --> 10:07.675
and then he climbed
up the pole

10:07.675 --> 10:09.011
and hooked up
the free cable.

10:09.011 --> 10:10.816
Meatwad: How was work, Frylock?

10:10.816 --> 10:12.152
Frylock: Oh, I got bit by a bat

10:12.152 --> 10:14.393
while I was refilling
the ranch dressing.

10:14.393 --> 10:15.561
Had to get rabies shots.

10:15.561 --> 10:18.101
Got shut down by the city.

10:18.101 --> 10:19.739

in the back speakers.

You know what I mean?

Which is weird 'cause
you're watching a game show.
