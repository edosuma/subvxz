00:09.635 --> 00:12.221
I've never questioned my purpose.

00:12.304 --> 00:15.933
I've never questioned what it is
that I wanted to do with my life.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.851
The Emmy goes to Billy Porter.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.605
Oh, my God. God bless you all.

00:22.898 --> 00:28.153
I know that what's inside of me has
something to do with my purpose in life.

00:28.237 --> 00:29.863
- Dear Billy…
- Dear Billy…

00:29.947 --> 00:32.991
Dear Billy,
You helped make my dreams tangible.

00:33.909 --> 00:40.874
My advice to people who want something is
that "something" is not specific enough.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.460
Get specific with your dreams.

00:43.544 --> 00:47.214
Dear Billy,
You helped me feel validated in my choices

00:47.297 --> 00:50.384
and more confident with being who I am.

00:50.884 --> 00:54.972
Receive me as I am,
and you're welcome into my life.

00:55.722 --> 00:58.684
If you can't do that,
please move out my way

00:58.767 --> 01:00.561
'cause I have stuff to do.

01:00.644 --> 01:01.937
Dear Billy…

01:27.754 --> 01:30.465
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

01:30.966 --> 01:34.469
in a neighborhood called East Liberty.
'Sliberty for short.

01:34.553 --> 01:38.473
It's sort of, like, apostrophe-S-Liberty.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.977
So, anybody from Pittsburgh
knows what you're talking about

01:42.060 --> 01:43.270
when you say 'Sliberty.

01:44.855 --> 01:49.902
It was a traditional, urban,
Black neighborhood.

01:49.985 --> 01:54.031
A little bit before white flight.

01:54.698 --> 02:00.913
There was a cross section of people
from all socioeconomic backgrounds.

02:00.996 --> 02:04.666
And while I was more
on the poorer side of things,

02:04.750 --> 02:09.253
I could walk five blocks
and see where the Black doctors lived

02:09.338 --> 02:12.382
and see where the Black lawyers lived.

02:12.466 --> 02:17.137
You know, there were aspirational aspects
to dream beyond your circumstance.

02:18.555 --> 02:24.478
I learned very early
that I had been blessed with a gift.

02:25.187 --> 02:27.648
I started singing in the church.

02:27.731 --> 02:33.654
It was interesting because
I noticed that all the adults were happy

02:33.737 --> 02:35.155
when I was singing.

02:35.739 --> 02:40.869
That's how I found and connected to
my art.

02:41.370 --> 02:47.042
That part of the church has always been
a beautiful thing for me.

02:48.418 --> 02:54.132
On the opposite side of the coin,
as my sexuality became clearer,

02:54.216 --> 03:00.180
I found that that church space
was a very homophobic place.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.517
Ninety percent of the time,

03:03.600 --> 03:09.773
there was somebody on the bully pulpit
condemning the gays as an abomination.

03:11.024 --> 03:14.486
We were at the start of the AIDS crisis,

03:14.570 --> 03:19.241
and the message was clear
that AIDS was God's punishment.

03:19.992 --> 03:26.290
That's devastating for a young, queer,
particularly Black person.

03:27.082 --> 03:32.129
I found myself not only
disenfranchised from the world,

03:33.422 --> 03:38.886
being a Black man in America,
but also then disenfranchised from my own.

03:40.012 --> 03:45.893
There was concern
that I was too much of a sissy.

03:46.602 --> 03:50.731
And at this point, in 1975,

03:50.814 --> 03:53.650
I was sent to a psychologist

03:53.734 --> 03:58.947
every Wednesday after kindergarten
for a year.

03:59.448 --> 04:03.535
Something was wrong with me,
and I needed to be fixed.

04:04.036 --> 04:05.954
You know, we live in a world where

04:06.038 --> 04:09.875
if you're not masculine,
you're unworthy of living.

04:10.584 --> 04:16.005
You know, there's a lot of toxic
masculine tropes to justify…

04:17.798 --> 04:18.884
fear.

04:18.966 --> 04:23.013
And fear very often transforms into hate.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.976
I was bullied heavily.

04:29.102 --> 04:34.191
There wasn't a place in the world
where I felt safe.

04:35.484 --> 04:39.154
But in the fifth grade,
there was a talent show,

04:39.238 --> 04:40.322
and I sang.

04:40.822 --> 04:43.325
Instantly the bullying stopped.

04:44.493 --> 04:47.037
And I thought, "Okay.

04:48.372 --> 04:50.040
Maybe I should keep singing."

04:53.418 --> 04:56.672
It was in that moment
that I made the decision

04:56.755 --> 04:58.924
to sing as loud as I could

04:59.758 --> 05:02.719
and as high as I could
for as long as I could.

05:04.847 --> 05:10.227
And when I was 11, I learned that
there was a thing called Broadway.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.522
And a light bulb went off.

05:14.106 --> 05:18.235
I was watching a broadcast
of the Tony Awards in 1981.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.779
Jennifer Holliday in Dreamgirls.

05:22.030 --> 05:26.535
I saw the revelation
that is Jennifer Holliday.

05:26.618 --> 05:31.081
There's no way I will

05:31.164 --> 05:34.251
And

05:34.334 --> 05:41.008
I am telling you

05:41.758 --> 05:42.926
Prior to that,

05:43.010 --> 05:47.556
I hadn't made the connection
that my talent could be a career.

05:48.140 --> 05:50.684
So something clicked in my brain
that let me know,

05:50.767 --> 05:54.396
"I could make money doing that,
so let me focus on that."

05:55.105 --> 05:57.232
I was trying to get educated in it.

05:57.316 --> 05:59.484
What do I do to make sure
that I'm good at this

05:59.568 --> 06:03.238
and I get myself ready and together
for Broadway?

06:03.322 --> 06:05.199
You know, that was the big dream.

06:06.158 --> 06:07.451
From Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

06:07.534 --> 06:10.621
here is Billy Porter.

06:12.331 --> 06:17.753
Stand tall, don't you be afraid

06:19.463 --> 06:23.800
You're sure to find your way

06:23.884 --> 06:30.140
So my voice was a buffer
to all that was out to destroy me.

06:30.224 --> 06:34.394
And the stronger that I got
and the more my craft got honed,

06:34.978 --> 06:36.688
the stronger I felt.

06:36.772 --> 06:42.945
There's a strength from within
That you can depend on…

06:43.737 --> 06:45.989
It became a superpower for me.

06:46.615 --> 06:52.079
I had a focus. I had a purpose.
I had a reason to live.

06:52.746 --> 06:58.043
And, I mean,
it just simply changed everything.

07:08.470 --> 07:11.056
Dear Billy, I've always been different.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.892
I feel like you'll understand what I mean.

07:14.810 --> 07:19.398
I was homeschooled in a very poor,
ultraconservative, Christian household.

07:20.023 --> 07:22.067
My father was very domineering

07:22.150 --> 07:24.444
and believed firmly
in traditional gender roles.

07:25.654 --> 07:29.283
"For as long as I can remember,
I was an embarrassment to him."

07:30.033 --> 07:32.536
Too much not like him, I guess.

07:32.619 --> 07:36.123
He ridiculed me,
telling me that I walked like a sissy,

07:36.206 --> 07:38.041
to toughen up and grow a pair.

07:40.002 --> 07:43.255
I was so sheltered, I didn't even
understand what being gay meant.

07:43.338 --> 07:44.464
But at 15 years old…

07:44.548 --> 07:47.259
"…I started to become
aware of my sexuality.

07:47.801 --> 07:51.763
I bought a men's workout magazine.
You know, buff guys everywhere."

07:52.472 --> 07:55.976
And even though I couldn't understand
the feelings I had when I looked at it,

07:56.059 --> 07:59.271
I knew there was shame involved
because I hid it from my parents.

08:02.149 --> 08:05.402
One day, my father told me
we were going on a two-week trip together.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.863
I didn't know where we were going,
but I was so excited.

08:10.365 --> 08:13.911
My father then revealed to me
this wouldn't be a vacation.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.580
He and my mother had found
my hidden magazine

08:16.663 --> 08:18.540
and decided I needed to go to a place

08:18.624 --> 08:21.919
to fix all the weird sexual shit
I had going on.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.130
It was
a Christian conversion therapy center.

08:25.214 --> 08:30.761
"And my father made it very clear
that if I wasn't fixed, he"--

08:34.389 --> 08:36.975
"He'd get rid of me.

08:37.058 --> 08:40.020
Either military school
or kicking me out of the house."

08:40.604 --> 08:43.982
My world was turned upside-down
in a matter of hours.

08:45.275 --> 08:48.904
In conversion therapy, I was told
that my eternal soul would be damned

08:48.987 --> 08:50.697
for the thoughts in my mind about men

08:51.281 --> 08:54.493
and that AIDS was the punishment
that God gave gays for their sins.

08:55.494 --> 08:57.287
I bought into every word that they said

08:57.371 --> 08:59.665
because I wanted so desperately
to be fixed.

09:01.792 --> 09:04.336
After coming home from conversion therapy,

09:04.419 --> 09:06.797
everything in my life
was focused on my faith.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.884
So to feel like God couldn't love me
anymore was profoundly devastating.

09:11.677 --> 09:14.304
"I had to fight every single gay thought,

09:14.388 --> 09:20.435
so I dove deeper and deeper into my faith
in hopes they would somehow finally stop.

09:21.395 --> 09:22.646
But they never did."

09:23.605 --> 09:25.941
I had never felt so hopeless and alone.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.235
At 16, I attempted suicide,

09:28.318 --> 09:31.238
just like countless others
that had gone through conversion therapy.

09:33.323 --> 09:36.410
Learning to not hate myself
was a long and painful journey.

09:36.493 --> 09:39.872
I couldn't have done it without
the voices of love that lifted me up.

09:40.455 --> 09:46.753
I'm not my father's son

09:48.046 --> 09:54.678
I'm not the image
Of what he dreamed of

09:55.345 --> 09:57.097
I first heard your beautiful voice

09:57.181 --> 09:59.683
when listening
to the Kinky Boots soundtrack.

09:59.766 --> 10:03.395
Over and over, I listened to the lyrics
of "Not My Father's Son."

10:03.478 --> 10:06.565
You sang,
"The endless story of expectations

10:06.648 --> 10:09.818
swirling inside my mind wore me down.

10:09.902 --> 10:13.739
I came to the realization,
and I found a way to turn it around

10:13.822 --> 10:16.533
to see that I could just be me."

10:16.617 --> 10:20.370
As I got older, I built up the courage
to come out of the closet.

10:20.454 --> 10:24.791
I realized there was nothing wrong with me
and that I deserved to be loved.

10:24.875 --> 10:31.715
And mirror what was not in me

10:35.093 --> 10:38.305
I am now a salon owner
and an LGBTQ advocate.

10:39.181 --> 10:40.557
When I started my business,

10:40.641 --> 10:43.435
I wanted it to be a place
of lifting up young queer people.

10:43.519 --> 10:45.354
I wanted to provide a safe place

10:45.437 --> 10:48.065
where trans and nonbinary people
can be themselves.

10:48.649 --> 10:52.277
Much like you,
I want to live visibly and vocally.

10:52.361 --> 10:55.489
You taught me that my voice,
which I'm still learning to love,

10:55.572 --> 10:57.449
is not something to hate.

10:57.533 --> 11:01.787
You taught me that it's powerful,
and this is something I'll never forget.

11:08.126 --> 11:13.507
Our neighborhoods post civil rights
movement were still benefiting

11:13.590 --> 11:19.388
from the investment that our government
had in place for communities of color,

11:19.930 --> 11:23.100
lots of government-funded programs

11:23.183 --> 11:27.771
the angels in my life
sort of pushed me towards.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.523
You know, it was free,

11:29.606 --> 11:31.984
and you got
the Center for Musically Talented,

11:32.067 --> 11:36.405
which was a Saturday music program
with private voice lesson.

11:36.488 --> 11:40.117
I had a private saxophone lesson
and solfège and choir class

11:40.200 --> 11:41.451
and opera worksho-- You know.

11:41.535 --> 11:46.540
I just threw myself into the arts,
and it made me happy.

11:47.916 --> 11:51.086
I ended up going to
the Creative Performing Arts high school.

11:51.170 --> 11:54.673
And I was actually on my way to New York
after high school.

11:54.756 --> 11:59.261
My drama teachers got wind that I was
gonna pack my stuff and go to New York,

11:59.344 --> 12:02.931
and I got pulled by my ear
into the office.

12:04.683 --> 12:06.560
And they sat me down, and they said,

12:06.643 --> 12:10.397
"Listen. You're one
of the greatest singers on the planet.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.982
You dance like a dream.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.610
Every time you open up your mouth,
it's a disaster.

12:15.444 --> 12:18.989
You gotta go somewhere
and learn how to act.

12:19.072 --> 12:24.995
And if you focus on your craft,
you will never be out of work."

12:26.705 --> 12:28.749
You know, they suggested Carnegie Mellon.

12:28.832 --> 12:34.213
And Carnegie Mellon University is
one of the top drama schools in the world.

12:35.005 --> 12:38.842
It was a 10- to 15-minute drive
away from where I grew up.

12:38.926 --> 12:41.512
And here's what we talk about
when we speak of access.

12:42.596 --> 12:43.889
I had no idea…

12:44.890 --> 12:47.893
until some white people told me
in the 12th grade.

12:48.477 --> 12:49.686
Thank God they did.

12:50.979 --> 12:55.526
The training that I received there
was impeccable.

12:56.109 --> 13:00.948
They were trying to train me
to work in the mainstream world.

13:01.031 --> 13:07.037
And in 1987, the only archetypes
for Black actors that really existed were

13:07.120 --> 13:09.331
James Earl Jones, the patriarch,

13:09.831 --> 13:12.292
Denzel Washington, the sex symbol,

13:12.793 --> 13:14.920
and Eddie Murphy, the genius clown.

13:15.754 --> 13:19.883
And all three of those archetypes
were heterosexual.

13:20.384 --> 13:22.094
So, in retrospect,

13:22.177 --> 13:28.183
the homophobia
that was entrenched in the training

13:28.267 --> 13:32.896
was actually people just trying to
get me to the point where I could work.

13:33.605 --> 13:37.234
They were trying to prepare me to fit in.

13:37.776 --> 13:42.739
There was no language at that time
for being a first.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.868
There was nobody that looked like me,

13:45.951 --> 13:51.540
so I spent a lot of time
trying to be masculine enough to fit in

13:52.749 --> 13:53.959
so I could eat.

13:57.045 --> 13:58.839
Dear Billy,

13:58.922 --> 14:01.717
When I was eight years old,
my mom put me in an acting class.

14:02.426 --> 14:06.305
Our first production was Rumpelstiltskin,
and I badly wanted to be the king.

14:06.388 --> 14:07.389
I didn't get the part,

14:07.472 --> 14:09.766
"…but I somehow convinced
my acting teacher

14:09.850 --> 14:13.478
to create a role for me
as the king's assistant."

14:13.979 --> 14:16.481
I did a lot of community theater
growing up.

14:16.565 --> 14:17.566
I liked acting,

14:17.649 --> 14:20.944
but it wasn't until the local theater
was prepping a production of Dreamgirls

14:21.028 --> 14:22.613
that I fell in love with it.

14:23.155 --> 14:25.908
Ladies and gentlemen,
the wildest man in show business,

14:25.991 --> 14:28.452
James "Thunder" Early!

14:28.535 --> 14:32.998
My acting teacher gave me a CD
of the 2001 concert version of Dreamgirls,

14:33.081 --> 14:35.125
and I was blown away.

14:35.209 --> 14:38.462
- Help, help, help me, Jesus
- Help me, Jesus

14:38.545 --> 14:41.131
Hearing your voice as James Early
was life-changing.

14:41.215 --> 14:44.176
- Help me
- Help me, Jesus

14:44.259 --> 14:46.261
It was so commanding and soulful.

14:46.345 --> 14:47.888
It's like you hear nothing else
but the passion

14:47.971 --> 14:49.681
for the story you're telling
when you sing.

14:56.146 --> 15:00.609
In that moment, I saw all these things
I thought about myself in you.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.361
The soul, the grit.

15:02.444 --> 15:06.031
"From that point on,
I knew theater was my path.

15:06.949 --> 15:10.494
And later I convinced my high school
to do a production of Dreamgirls."

15:10.577 --> 15:14.414
And yes, I played the role of James Early.

15:14.498 --> 15:16.583
But when I got to college, things changed.

15:17.584 --> 15:21.088
At the time, I was the only Black male
in the musical theater department.

15:21.672 --> 15:23.006
It was difficult.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.843
It felt like I was in a space
that wasn't designed for me.

15:25.926 --> 15:28.470
It was hard for me to find material
that I could relate to.

15:28.554 --> 15:31.515
There was only a small selection
of stereotypical roles,

15:31.598 --> 15:34.184
which never really represented me.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.813
I was desperately trying
to find my identity.

15:37.896 --> 15:41.233
"I stripped everything else away
and said to myself,

15:41.316 --> 15:45.153
'What do I know?
What do I wanna talk about?'"

15:45.237 --> 15:46.947
And the answer was simple:

15:47.030 --> 15:48.949
Black people in theater.

15:49.032 --> 15:51.827
I ended up creating a platform
called "Broadway Black."

15:52.870 --> 15:56.456
I wrote a couple of blogs,
but honestly, the whole thing scared me.

15:56.540 --> 15:58.709
I thought to myself,
"I live in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.169
I don't live in New York."

16:00.752 --> 16:03.547
Things got worse in 2012
when I lost my job.

16:03.630 --> 16:06.466
"I had tickets
to see Kinky Boots in Chicago."

16:08.927 --> 16:11.221
I know this boy.

16:11.305 --> 16:13.557
And I was about to sell them,
as tight as money was,

16:13.640 --> 16:15.934
but, at the last minute, decided not to.

16:17.186 --> 16:19.771
Me and a couple friends
drove the three hours to Chicago,

16:19.855 --> 16:23.150
and it was an amazing, inspiring show
that I'll never forget.

16:23.233 --> 16:24.401
After it was over,

16:24.484 --> 16:27.404
we went to the stage door,
hoping to get some autographs.

16:27.905 --> 16:29.656
And to our surprise, you opened the door,

16:29.740 --> 16:32.367
saw us and welcomed us
as you signed our programs.

16:32.951 --> 16:34.995
You were so present and genuinely warm.

16:35.078 --> 16:37.956
"I told you about my dream
to go to New York

16:38.040 --> 16:39.374
to pursue my love of theater

16:39.458 --> 16:44.463
and fulfill my platform of highlighting
and celebrating Black actors on Broadway."

16:44.546 --> 16:47.049
And you looked at me
dead in the eye and said,

16:47.132 --> 16:49.676
"If that's what you wanna do,
then you need to get there."

16:50.219 --> 16:52.804
That sounds just like me.

16:52.888 --> 16:54.890
It was a defining moment in my life

16:54.973 --> 16:57.601
because at the time,
my dreams didn't feel tangible.

16:58.352 --> 16:59.811
Billy, to be able to talk to you,

16:59.895 --> 17:03.315
it simply made my dream
a living, breathing reality.

17:05.442 --> 17:09.488
I packed up a couple suitcases and bought
a one-way ticket to New York City.

17:10.030 --> 17:13.200
I knew I was in the right place
at the right time of my life.

17:13.282 --> 17:16.328
Now I needed to make Broadway Black
a reality.

17:18.539 --> 17:20.915
Except I had no idea what I was doing.

17:20.999 --> 17:23.167
I wasn't a journalist.
I wasn't a photographer.

17:23.252 --> 17:25.212
I just knew what I wanted to feel.

17:25.295 --> 17:28.131
So I just started showing up
at press events with my iPhone.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.383
I felt like such an amateur,

17:29.466 --> 17:32.719
but at the time, nobody was
on the red carpet doing social media,

17:32.803 --> 17:35.138
so I was discovering as I went along.

17:35.222 --> 17:38.600
To my surprise,
it grew organically, very quickly.

17:39.852 --> 17:43.564
A magical moment happened
just six months after I moved to New York.

17:43.647 --> 17:45.732
Kinky Boots was opening in the city.

17:45.816 --> 17:48.861
At the after-party, there was
a young lady sitting at my table,

17:48.944 --> 17:51.572
and she gave me the biggest smile,
asking who I was.

17:52.155 --> 17:54.157
"I nervously told her, 'I'm Drew.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.743
I run a platform called Broadway Black.'

17:56.827 --> 17:58.912
She replied, 'I know Broadway Black…'"

17:58.996 --> 18:02.916
"…because my brother, Billy Porter,
is Black, and he's on Broadway."

18:05.210 --> 18:07.212
That's my sister too.

18:07.296 --> 18:08.964
"I was like, 'What?'"

18:09.548 --> 18:13.260
So I ended up sitting at that table
all night with your sister and mother.

18:13.343 --> 18:15.179
Later on, there I was, holding flowers

18:15.262 --> 18:17.431
and helping you and your family
to your car.

18:17.514 --> 18:19.975
It was such a profound, full-circle moment

18:20.058 --> 18:21.977
because what got me to New York
in the first place

18:22.060 --> 18:25.022
was talking with you
after seeing Kinky Boots in Chicago.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.275
Billy, I can tell you
with absolute certainty…

18:28.358 --> 18:32.070
"…that if I hadn't heard
your voice when I was young…"

18:33.447 --> 18:35.365
…and if I hadn't met you that night
in Chicago,

18:35.449 --> 18:38.160
my life would look completely different.

18:39.077 --> 18:40.287
Love you, Drew.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.584
I spent the summer
of my sophomore and junior year

18:45.667 --> 18:47.044
in New York City,

18:47.544 --> 18:49.421
and right before I came back to school,

18:49.505 --> 18:52.299
they were having auditions
for Miss Saigon.

18:52.382 --> 18:55.719
So Carnegie Mellon gave me credit
to move to New York,

18:55.802 --> 18:58.472
and that was my first Broadway show.

18:59.181 --> 19:01.517
It was magical.

19:02.059 --> 19:06.104
I had made it. I was on Broadway.

19:06.688 --> 19:08.899
The dream had come true.

19:09.483 --> 19:14.571
And I remember thinking,
"I'm on Broadway. Okay, what next?"

19:15.447 --> 19:17.366
I was in the ensemble of Miss Saigon,

19:17.449 --> 19:19.201
which meant I was in the back,
in the dark.

19:19.284 --> 19:22.037
And I quickly realized that
that's not the place I wanted to be.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.539
I wanted to be in the front.

19:24.331 --> 19:26.583
In the spot. Center stage.

19:27.417 --> 19:28.877
So that then became the next dream,

19:28.961 --> 19:30.712
and I went through
a series of Broadway shows

19:30.796 --> 19:35.217
where I was afforded the opportunity
to be a principal character.

19:35.717 --> 19:39.972
And I was being hired to raise the roof,
blow the roof off the joint.

19:40.055 --> 19:43.225
But, like, when it came time for my story,

19:43.308 --> 19:45.060
to tell my story,
nobody wanted to hear it.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.272
So I chose a different path.

19:48.355 --> 19:50.274
I've been watching you

19:50.357 --> 19:55.654
Just to see how far you would go

19:55.737 --> 19:58.615
I crossed over into music

19:58.699 --> 20:02.202
and threw myself
into the masculinity game.

20:03.871 --> 20:08.041
And I was relegated to this pigeonhole
that really made me uncomfortable,

20:08.709 --> 20:12.754
because the masculinity box
was never mine to fit into.

20:15.674 --> 20:20.929
And then I heard about this play
by Tony Kushner called Angels in America.

20:21.013 --> 20:22.681
I want a white nurse.

20:24.224 --> 20:26.685
- My constitutional right.
- This is a hospital.

20:26.768 --> 20:29.396
You don't have any constitutional rights.

20:29.479 --> 20:32.232
I was doing Grease at the time.

20:32.858 --> 20:36.403
And the Walter Kerr was a block down,
and that's where Angels in America was.

20:36.486 --> 20:38.614
And I took myself to see the play,

20:39.323 --> 20:40.449
and I…

20:44.286 --> 20:45.329
I couldn't speak.

20:47.039 --> 20:49.499
My breath was taken away,

20:49.583 --> 20:54.129
not only by the brilliant craftsmanship
of the writing,

20:54.713 --> 20:57.966
but there's a character
by the name of Belize.

20:58.050 --> 20:59.927
And it was the first time

21:00.844 --> 21:05.224
that I had seen a reflection of myself.

21:06.183 --> 21:11.772
A Black, gay man
who was not the butt of the joke,

21:11.855 --> 21:17.486
you know, not vilified for his sexuality,
but was actually the moral compass.

21:18.153 --> 21:22.324
And I realized in that moment,
those are the kinds of roles I wanna play.

21:23.325 --> 21:27.371
I realized
I am the change I'm looking for.

21:27.454 --> 21:31.416
And in the position that I'm in now,
no one will ever see that.

21:32.584 --> 21:36.213
So I left behind what I had been building.

21:37.214 --> 21:40.759
And the work dried up
for a very long time.

21:42.135 --> 21:43.762
But in 2010,

21:44.847 --> 21:47.850
I booked the off-Broadway revival
of Angels in America…

21:49.852 --> 21:51.520
playing the role of Belize.

21:53.397 --> 21:57.234
It was a transformative experience.

21:57.317 --> 21:59.653
An empowering experience.

22:00.612 --> 22:04.908
It was the beginning of me
understanding my own power,

22:06.159 --> 22:09.162
and that I never needed to
second-guess myself ever again.

22:10.205 --> 22:12.332
Everybody told me my queerdness
would be my liability.

22:12.416 --> 22:15.586
And it was, for decades.

22:16.628 --> 22:18.130
Until it wasn't.

22:21.175 --> 22:22.259
Dear Billy,

22:23.343 --> 22:27.139
I was a teenager in 1998
when I first came out as a lesbian.

22:27.806 --> 22:30.142
I hung out on the piers
in the West Village,

22:30.225 --> 22:33.520
just like the kids
in the TV series you star in, Pose.

22:34.396 --> 22:37.065
I never thought I could be
part of the mainstream,

22:37.149 --> 22:41.153
so I told myself I didn't want to enter
some of the formal institutions:

22:41.236 --> 22:44.573
corporate America, marriage
or even being a parent.

22:45.073 --> 22:47.784
But the world around me changed.

22:47.868 --> 22:52.456
All of a sudden, corporate America
was talking about LGBTQ people

22:52.539 --> 22:54.750
and actually advocating for them.

22:54.833 --> 22:58.003
I remember seeing their logos on floats
in the Pride parade.

22:58.086 --> 23:01.215
Laws were changing,
and parents were standing up,

23:01.298 --> 23:03.800
saying,
"It's all right that my kid is gay."

23:04.510 --> 23:06.678
"It felt like, for the first time,

23:06.762 --> 23:08.222
there was an opportunity

23:08.305 --> 23:11.099
for me to think about
those parts of my identity

23:11.183 --> 23:13.143
that I'd never thought were possible."

23:13.977 --> 23:16.522
So, on a whim, I left my corporate job

23:16.605 --> 23:20.567
and started working for
a scrappy LGBTQ non-profit.

23:21.193 --> 23:24.738
Right after,
I instantly regretted my decision.

23:24.821 --> 23:26.448
"What was I thinking?

23:27.324 --> 23:29.826
In the middle of my existential crisis…"

23:29.910 --> 23:32.579
…I found myself at a packed fundraiser.

23:33.163 --> 23:35.541
A purple light illuminated someone

23:35.624 --> 23:38.043
sitting on a stool
in the middle of the room.

23:39.294 --> 23:41.338
Billy, it was you.

23:41.421 --> 23:47.386
There was no band, no music,
no backup singers, no choreography.

23:47.469 --> 23:52.933
It was just you and your beautiful voice,
singing the song "Love Yourself."

23:53.767 --> 23:58.272
There were a thousand people in the room,
and they all melted away.

23:58.355 --> 23:59.439
"In that moment,

23:59.523 --> 24:03.527
I realized that choosing with your heart
is never the wrong decision

24:03.610 --> 24:06.905
and being true to yourself
is the most important thing."

24:06.989 --> 24:09.658
I stayed at that non-profit for two years,

24:10.242 --> 24:12.160
then went to work for the ACLU

24:12.244 --> 24:15.289
and have been fighting for equality
ever since.

24:16.790 --> 24:20.460
In 2016, I was about to enter
a new phase in my life

24:20.544 --> 24:23.088
that I never thought would happen.

24:23.172 --> 24:24.548
I became pregnant.

24:25.048 --> 24:27.509
It was hard to see myself as a mother,

24:27.593 --> 24:32.222
probably because, deep down,
I didn't feel as if I deserved it.

24:32.723 --> 24:35.225
"I've always had
a case of impostor syndrome,

24:35.893 --> 24:39.730
a feeling that I don't deserve
things I've earned

24:39.813 --> 24:41.732
or that they're not really mine."

24:41.815 --> 24:45.611
Adding a child into the mix
just compounded that feeling.

24:45.694 --> 24:47.529
Am I shortchanging my child

24:47.613 --> 24:51.408
because I'm not creating
what people think is a traditional family?

24:52.201 --> 24:55.746
But seeing you on Sesame Street
in your Oscar dress

24:55.829 --> 24:57.956
was extremely validating for me.

24:58.707 --> 25:01.376
To see that kind of diversity
and representation

25:01.460 --> 25:05.339
in everyday programming for kids
was monumental.

25:05.422 --> 25:08.634
Seeing that helped me
feel validated in my choices

25:09.218 --> 25:12.346
and more confident with being who I am,

25:12.429 --> 25:14.806
especially as a parent.

25:14.890 --> 25:16.433
Thank you, Billy,

25:16.517 --> 25:19.561
for everything you've done
and continue to do…

25:19.645 --> 25:21.104
"…for us pier kids,

25:21.897 --> 25:25.400
men who wear dresses
and women who wear suits and ties.

25:26.068 --> 25:30.113
For kids who have two moms and trans dads.

25:31.949 --> 25:37.871
For anyone who doesn't quite fit in
but who needs to know, deep down…"

25:37.955 --> 25:41.500
…that they are worthy,
and everyone in between.

25:49.633 --> 25:53.053
In 2013, I was afforded the opportunity

25:53.136 --> 25:55.097
to play Lola in Kinky Boots.

25:55.180 --> 25:59.476
If you hit the dust
Let me raise you up

25:59.560 --> 26:03.188
When your bubble busts
Let me raise you up

26:03.272 --> 26:07.234
If your glitter rusts
Let me raise you up

26:07.317 --> 26:10.070
And it was just spectacular.

26:11.363 --> 26:15.158
If you hit the dust
Let me raise you up

26:15.659 --> 26:19.204
The journey of Lola
really cracked me open.

26:21.748 --> 26:25.627
You know, it was just really
a journey to self-acceptance

26:25.711 --> 26:28.881
and being able to love yourself

26:28.964 --> 26:33.760
and detach from those energies
that don't support who you are

26:34.386 --> 26:38.182
with respect, compassion and love.

26:39.558 --> 26:43.896
Being able to practice that
eight times a week

26:43.979 --> 26:46.231
was a glorious feeling.

26:47.941 --> 26:50.736
The American Theatre Wing's Tony goes to…

26:51.904 --> 26:53.447
Billy Porter, Kinky Boots.

26:54.740 --> 26:59.870
I was no longer trying to fit into
somebody else's idea of what I should be.

27:00.412 --> 27:01.496
Thank you.

27:01.580 --> 27:06.043
When I let that go, I set myself free

27:06.710 --> 27:08.337
and won the Tony and the Grammy.

27:08.921 --> 27:11.673
And this is what a Tony and Grammy award
can do for you.

27:12.299 --> 27:15.844
I got a call to host the red carpet
at the Oscars.

27:17.012 --> 27:20.474
You know, and I went back
to my time at Carnegie Mellon

27:20.557 --> 27:22.976
and hanging out with my friends
at Oscar parties,

27:23.060 --> 27:25.729
and I would always say,
"I'ma wear a gown to the Oscars."

27:25.812 --> 27:29.483
You know, I saw the power and the impact
that the ladies have,

27:29.566 --> 27:31.818
and I thought,
"The men don't get to have that impact

27:31.902 --> 27:34.112
because all they do is
wear a penguin suit every time."

27:34.821 --> 27:40.160
And I thought, "What if it looks like
a traditional tuxedo from the waist up,

27:40.786 --> 27:43.330
and then, when it pulls back,

27:43.997 --> 27:46.708
it's a full, antebellum ball gown.

27:47.668 --> 27:49.753
That will gag the children!"

27:50.671 --> 27:53.006
I am not a drag queen by profession.

27:53.090 --> 27:58.679
I am a gay man who is choosing
to wear a ball gown. For real.

27:59.471 --> 28:01.682
That's a new lane.
That's a new conversation.

28:02.432 --> 28:07.145
You know, I always say there's BO, AO,
"before Oscar" and "after Oscar,"

28:07.229 --> 28:08.772
in terms of my career.

28:09.356 --> 28:14.069
Honoring my own truth
has opened up the space for me.

28:14.570 --> 28:19.157
When you lean into that,
everything else will work itself out.

28:19.241 --> 28:20.784
And it did.

28:21.910 --> 28:23.370
I got a telephone call from my agent.

28:23.453 --> 28:26.290
"Ryan Murphy is doing a show
about the ball culture."

28:26.373 --> 28:30.085
And I finally felt
like the universe was hearing me.

28:31.545 --> 28:33.505
And so I went in prepared to the audition,

28:33.589 --> 28:35.716
and I said,
"Listen, I've been to the balls.

28:35.799 --> 28:37.759
I know what this story is."

28:37.843 --> 28:39.887
He said, "Well, if you can do a version

28:39.970 --> 28:43.599
of the emcee from Paris is Burning
at the balls"…

28:43.682 --> 28:46.935
It do take nerve. Believe me.

28:47.019 --> 28:48.604
…"I will create a role for you."

28:48.687 --> 28:51.023
I mean, can I?

28:51.106 --> 28:55.110
It's like the whole culture has been doing
an impersonation of the emcee

28:55.194 --> 28:56.987
from Paris is Burning
for the last 30 years.

28:57.070 --> 29:00.616
The entire culture,
not even knowing that they're doing it.

29:00.699 --> 29:01.909
Opulence!

29:02.784 --> 29:05.787
And that night,
he offered me a part on Pose

29:05.871 --> 29:07.956
and said that they were gonna create
something for me.

29:08.040 --> 29:10.209
And that is how Pray Tell was born.

29:10.292 --> 29:11.919
Yes, darling, I know, I know.

29:12.002 --> 29:15.005
Just place that jacket
in the Christmas ornament box,

29:15.088 --> 29:16.381
and we'll get back to you.

29:17.341 --> 29:21.386
We were towards the end
of filming season one.

29:21.470 --> 29:26.767
And I caught wind
that they were putting me in the category

29:26.850 --> 29:30.938
for an Emmy
for best leading actor in a drama.

29:31.021 --> 29:32.648
And I said, "I'm not the lead.

29:33.982 --> 29:35.817
I'm not the lead. It's an ensemble show."

29:35.901 --> 29:37.319
He said, "You're my lead."

29:37.819 --> 29:41.740
He saw my fear. All the years of struggle.

29:42.366 --> 29:45.702
All the years of being told
I was too much or too this

29:45.786 --> 29:49.456
or too gay or too Black or too--
You know, he saw all of it.

29:50.791 --> 29:53.418
Ryan looked me in the eye, and he said,

29:53.502 --> 30:00.092
"The world needs to see
what a Black, gay leading man looks like.

30:00.884 --> 30:02.010
And it's you.

30:02.094 --> 30:07.474
So, it's time for you
to sit on your throne, queen."

30:09.685 --> 30:13.605
Here are the nominees
for lead actor in a drama series.

30:14.398 --> 30:16.149
Billy Porter, Pose.

30:16.942 --> 30:19.444
On the night of the awards,

30:19.528 --> 30:23.949
I really had no idea until it happened…

30:24.449 --> 30:27.327
And once again we witness history unfold.

30:27.411 --> 30:29.830
The Emmy goes to Billy Porter.

30:31.123 --> 30:34.001
…that I was the first Black, gay man

30:34.084 --> 30:38.672
to win an Emmy
for best leading actor in a drama.

30:39.840 --> 30:43.802
It just never occurred to me,
"I'm the first."

30:43.886 --> 30:47.472
The category is love, y'all, love!

30:47.556 --> 30:51.101
I would like to live in a world
where we don't have to keep saying

30:51.185 --> 30:55.189
that some Black person or some minority
or some woman is the first at something.

30:55.272 --> 30:59.610
And I may be the first,
but I will not be the last.

30:59.693 --> 31:01.445
God bless you. God bless you.

31:01.528 --> 31:04.031
If I forgot anybody, I'm sorry.

31:04.114 --> 31:05.532
I love you all.

31:09.828 --> 31:11.079
Dear Billy,

31:11.580 --> 31:14.208
I know you have fans all over the world,

31:14.291 --> 31:16.877
but what if
one of the biggest impacts you made

31:16.960 --> 31:19.880
was on someone who's followed you
their entire life?

31:21.089 --> 31:23.383
There's a 20-year age gap between us,

31:23.467 --> 31:25.761
but we walked
the same streets of Pittsburgh.

31:25.844 --> 31:27.346
Homewood to be exact.

31:27.429 --> 31:28.639
And as you know well,

31:28.722 --> 31:31.975
Homewood is not always the kind of place
where dreams go to come true.

31:32.851 --> 31:34.102
But then there's you.

31:34.603 --> 31:36.146
"You inspired me to believe

31:36.230 --> 31:39.483
that I was worthy
of my dreams coming true."

31:39.983 --> 31:42.945
And even now,
seeing you at my sister's wedding,

31:43.028 --> 31:44.863
how you've grown and blossomed

31:44.947 --> 31:49.409
while still managing to be
the same Billy we all love to love.

31:49.493 --> 31:54.414
"You probably guessed it by now."

31:54.498 --> 31:55.499
Yes, it's me.

31:56.542 --> 31:58.085
Your cousin Alicia.

32:02.130 --> 32:04.466
You're one of the success stories
of Homewood.

32:04.550 --> 32:06.844
But have you walked the streets lately?

32:06.927 --> 32:09.221
We've got a lot of room for improvement,

32:09.304 --> 32:11.849
and we're making some great progress
thanks to you.

32:11.932 --> 32:15.185
You breaking barriers so fiercely
in your career

32:15.269 --> 32:17.855
inspired me to strive to be a champion.

32:18.897 --> 32:21.859
But, Billy, what truly set me
on a new course

32:21.942 --> 32:24.152
was your bold New York Times article.

32:24.236 --> 32:26.905
You declared that from then on,

32:26.989 --> 32:30.617
you would refuse to be pigeonholed
in stereotypical roles.

32:30.701 --> 32:35.038
You put your entire career on the line
to say no and choose your own path.

32:36.039 --> 32:40.419
It gave me confidence to see you
taking the risk to be your true self.

32:40.502 --> 32:43.755
I realized that I had two choices
about my life.

32:44.715 --> 32:45.841
I could complain…

32:46.425 --> 32:48.135
"…or I could take action."

32:49.303 --> 32:50.304
Alicia.

32:52.014 --> 32:55.976
I saw a glimmer of progress being made
in housing development in the city,

32:56.059 --> 32:58.020
and I wanted to be on that team.

32:58.103 --> 33:02.316
"I lobbied city council
hard-core and asked for an internship.

33:02.399 --> 33:03.942
I'm usually pretty shy…"

33:04.026 --> 33:07.988
…but a closed mouth
don't get fed, and I got that internship.

33:08.071 --> 33:11.158
Now I'm a full-time staff member,

33:11.241 --> 33:15.370
working to launch a $200 million
housing initiative in Homewood

33:15.454 --> 33:16.955
called Avenues of Hope.

33:17.581 --> 33:20.792
This is the largest housing
and economic development

33:20.876 --> 33:23.086
the city of Pittsburgh has ever seen.

33:23.670 --> 33:26.048
"At least 350 new homes."

33:26.715 --> 33:28.884
I am honored to be part of a renaissance

33:28.967 --> 33:30.552
that is changing our narrative…

33:30.636 --> 33:33.222
"…in a battered but resilient community."

33:33.722 --> 33:37.351
Billy, you once sang this line
like an anthem:

33:37.434 --> 33:40.479
"I'm going to be part of this revolution."

33:41.063 --> 33:44.816
And now, I'm part of the revolution too.

33:45.567 --> 33:47.110
I love you, baby.

34:04.670 --> 34:08.757
2007 was the worst year
of my life. I had nothing.

34:09.424 --> 34:11.260
You know, I'm bankrupt.

34:11.342 --> 34:13.679
I was on the precipice of obscurity,

34:13.762 --> 34:15.722
living in the basement
of a friend's apartment.

34:18.183 --> 34:20.686
I went to the LGBTQ+ clinic.

34:20.768 --> 34:24.481
The queen at the desk was like,
"You want an HIV test, girl?"

34:24.565 --> 34:26.483
I said, "Yeah, it's six months."

34:27.693 --> 34:31.612
And then they were like,
"The doctor wants to talk to you."

34:31.697 --> 34:33.197
So I go outside to the lobby,

34:33.282 --> 34:37.202
and then he comes down the hall
with that face,

34:38.161 --> 34:41.706
with that look from the movies
that you see.

34:42.541 --> 34:44.168
I was HIV-positive.

34:47.379 --> 34:52.759
The fourteen years of carrying this load

34:52.842 --> 34:55.888
and the shame that went with it…

34:57.848 --> 35:03.520
was a slow death.

35:06.106 --> 35:12.279
There was never a moment in my life
before May 19, 2021,

35:12.362 --> 35:15.199
that I was not stuck in the quagmire

35:15.282 --> 35:19.244
and living under the cloud
of some sort of shame.

35:20.579 --> 35:26.210
Until May 19, 2021…

35:28.170 --> 35:31.298
because that's when
I came out to the world as HIV-positive.

35:32.966 --> 35:35.677
So, until a few months ago,

35:36.929 --> 35:41.391
I was bound and locked. Bound up.

35:42.893 --> 35:46.688
And I accomplished all of this under that.

35:48.524 --> 35:51.276
Imagine the possibil--

35:57.241 --> 36:00.494
Imagine the possibility now.
I don't even know.

36:01.245 --> 36:03.247
I'ma let the universe take care of it.

36:05.123 --> 36:09.169
And my hope is that, in my freedom,
I set somebody else free.

36:09.795 --> 36:12.631
You know, queer boys and girls

36:12.714 --> 36:17.386
of all shapes, sizes,
races, colors, creeds,

36:17.469 --> 36:19.137
can be set free.

36:19.221 --> 36:22.057
You've changed the way
our world looks at queer people.

36:22.140 --> 36:24.685
I hope that in small ways,
I can do the same.

36:24.768 --> 36:28.689
No matter how big or small,
we can all be part of the change.

36:28.772 --> 36:31.024
You helped make my dreams tangible.

36:31.108 --> 36:33.902
Thank you, Billy,
for everything you've done.

36:33.986 --> 36:36.697
Love, your cousin Alicia.

36:36.780 --> 36:38.532
Much love, Peter.

36:38.615 --> 36:40.325
Love, Alison.

36:40.409 --> 36:44.538
From the bottom of my heart,
I love you. Drew.

36:44.621 --> 36:48.083
I stand on the shoulders
of so many who came before me,

36:48.166 --> 36:52.254
and it is my responsibility
to keep my shoulders strong

36:52.337 --> 36:55.215
so that there can be
those to stand on mine.
