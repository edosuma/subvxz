WEBVTT

00:04.705 --> 00:07.906
Come on, guys! Let's keep
those hands up and move!

00:07.908 --> 00:10.409
That's it. Jab, jab, jab!

00:10.411 --> 00:13.211
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Over this! Don't break!!

00:13.280 --> 00:16.715
Jab, jab, jab! That's it!
Keep that jab going!

00:16.784 --> 00:19.318
- That's it! That's it!
- Hold on!

00:19.386 --> 00:21.186
Come on, Moses,
wait for your chance.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.488
Tuck that chin in, guys.
Come on now!

00:23.557 --> 00:25.124
Ernest Hemingway.

00:25.192 --> 00:28.427
What brings a private
detective to a boxing match?

00:28.495 --> 00:31.130
Maybe a certain boxer?
Alright, give it to him!

00:31.198 --> 00:33.999
- Break! Break!
- Did you see that, Hemingway?

00:34.068 --> 00:37.136
Boxer lands punch...
great headline.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.304
OK, come on,

00:39.372 --> 00:42.174
let's move! Let's keep moving!
Keep moving! Right there!

00:44.845 --> 00:47.746
You're gonna give
Moses Page his due.

00:47.815 --> 00:50.082
Not like that last column
you dashed off.

00:50.150 --> 00:52.317
You sleep through that fight?

00:52.385 --> 00:54.519
- Well, I was hungover.
- Please.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.899
- So yes, I probably nodded off.
- Don't you ever get tired

00:56.923 --> 00:59.691
of your own arrogance?

01:01.595 --> 01:03.362
Alright, back up!

01:03.430 --> 01:05.197
- You OK, buddy?
- Great,

01:05.199 --> 01:07.632
the one interesting thing,
and you made me miss it.

01:07.701 --> 01:11.103
Well, it's your fault for arguing. So you'll
be betting on Moses in his next fight?

01:11.171 --> 01:13.805
Highly unethical
for a <i> Toronto Star</i> reporter.

01:13.874 --> 01:16.007
Well, I'll be reading
your next article.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.976
Try to be objective for once.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.979
Always a pleasure, Ms. Drake.

01:21.047 --> 01:23.415
OK, that's better.

01:23.483 --> 01:27.086
That's better. That's better.
Get up, buddy, you're OK.

01:31.358 --> 01:33.258
That Hemingway,

01:33.327 --> 01:35.660
he's just a twobit typist. Haha!

01:35.663 --> 01:37.796
You know, if I listened
to critics,

01:37.864 --> 01:39.798
I'd have given up
a long time ago.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.867
Moses Page, the voice of calm.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.668
I'm just saving it for the ring.

01:43.737 --> 01:48.039
Then, Jack Dempsey had better
look out. When do you leave?

01:48.108 --> 01:51.209
I leave for Chicago
on the weekend.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.512
You can take him. You know that.

01:53.580 --> 01:56.415
Thanks for the pep talk, Coach.

01:56.483 --> 02:01.052
Well, can I interest you
in a cold gin?

02:01.121 --> 02:02.955
Hello there. Excuse me,

02:03.023 --> 02:06.024
but are you Frankie Drake?
Who's asking?

02:06.092 --> 02:09.294
- I need some advice.
- Can't it wait 'til morning,

02:09.295 --> 02:11.897
Mister... whoever you are?
I don't think so.

02:11.965 --> 02:15.567
I'm Eric Morrison. Cap told me if I
needed something, to look you up.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.936
- "Cap" as in Captain Morrison?
- Yeah.

02:18.004 --> 02:20.038
It's about my car.
How do you know Cap?

02:20.106 --> 02:22.741
He's my father.
It's parked close by.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.043
She's not a mechanic;
You should just

02:25.111 --> 02:27.579
call a garage in the morning.
I don't think

02:27.581 --> 02:30.815
I should wait. Can't you just
come and have a look?

02:30.884 --> 02:33.051
Go check the car, Frankie,

02:33.119 --> 02:35.187
and I'll see you
before I leave town.

02:35.255 --> 02:37.222
I'd like that.

02:38.758 --> 02:41.159
Alright, Mr. Morrison, let's go
see what's so important.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:50.470 --> 02:52.137
So how is Cap anyway?

02:52.206 --> 02:54.139
I hardly see him.
He's always travelling.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.308
And he's still
with the Signal Corps?

02:56.376 --> 02:59.177
I don't actually know.
It's all a bit hushhush.

02:59.246 --> 03:01.213
OK. So you've been here
a few months,

03:01.281 --> 03:04.816
and you have a car already?
It's a recent acquisition.

03:04.818 --> 03:06.885
- Did you steal it?
- I didn't steal it.

03:06.954 --> 03:09.454
And anyway, it's not
about the car per se;

03:09.522 --> 03:11.223
It's about my trunk.

03:11.291 --> 03:14.092
Mr. Morrison, I don't know
how I can help you.

03:14.094 --> 03:16.562
I think you will
when you see him.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.397
There's a man.

03:20.467 --> 03:24.135
Past tense more appropriate.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.406
Is this something
you could help me with?

03:42.790 --> 03:44.789
You have no idea

03:44.792 --> 03:46.591
who this is or how he got here.

03:46.594 --> 03:49.194
I've no idea. I got off
the ferry, looked in my trunk

03:49.263 --> 03:51.896
and found him.
And you brought the trunk

03:51.965 --> 03:53.898
over from London?
Yes. It's been sitting

03:53.967 --> 03:56.001
on the back of the car.
And who did you buy

03:56.069 --> 03:58.336
the car from? I didn't buy it...

03:58.339 --> 04:00.605
I won it in a poker game.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.540
Fair and square.

04:02.609 --> 04:03.542
Can you help me?

04:03.610 --> 04:06.411
Have you touched the body?

04:06.480 --> 04:08.213
I checked for the guy's pulse

04:08.281 --> 04:10.415
and his wallet.
He didn't have either.

04:10.483 --> 04:13.151
What do we do?

04:13.219 --> 04:15.553
First, we call the police...

04:15.556 --> 04:17.355
anonymously.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.357
Hopefully, that will buy us
enough time to get.

04:33.707 --> 04:36.675
You look wiped out, Frankie.

04:36.743 --> 04:38.810
Let's just say
it was a long night.

04:38.878 --> 04:41.680
- Sounds fun.
- I wish.

04:41.748 --> 04:44.883
So, a body was called in
anonymously...

04:46.453 --> 04:48.586
You mean our friend
in the trunk?

04:48.589 --> 04:50.255
Neat packing job.

04:50.323 --> 04:52.924
He's on the table,
uncurling in the autopsy room.

04:52.926 --> 04:56.862
Well, I need a time of death
and an identity.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.863
Preferably before the coppers.

04:58.932 --> 05:01.199
That's a lot of pressure.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.212
Let me get this straight.

05:14.281 --> 05:15.624
Because this kid's father
is a guy you knew in the war

05:15.648 --> 05:17.349
you don't think he's the killer?

05:17.417 --> 05:19.584
Well, he could have just
dumped the body.

05:19.586 --> 05:21.486
Instead, he same to see me.

05:21.555 --> 05:25.390
OK, well, let's say he didn't
murder the sucker in the trunk,

05:25.458 --> 05:26.892
who did?

05:26.960 --> 05:28.571
Maybe it has
something to do with the car.

05:28.595 --> 05:31.863
Now, Eric said that he won it
in some poker game.

05:31.931 --> 05:34.766
Or maybe it's just random.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.402
Though not likely.
Someone framing Eric?

05:37.470 --> 05:40.305
Yeah, if that's the case,
why him? What's he done?

05:40.373 --> 05:44.008
Maybe he really is the killer.

05:46.980 --> 05:50.082
Hello. It's me,
your latest client.

05:52.119 --> 05:55.420
You... didn't change
your mind, did you?

05:55.488 --> 05:58.990
Not yet.
Eric, this is Trudy Clarke,

05:59.059 --> 06:01.226
- my associate.
- Delighted.

06:01.228 --> 06:04.829
You seem pretty upbeat for a guy who
could be doing the dance very soon.

06:04.832 --> 06:07.565
- "Dance"?
- She means the noose.

06:07.634 --> 06:09.100
Is it really that bad?

06:09.169 --> 06:11.102
Do you have an alibi
for last night?

06:11.171 --> 06:13.338
I already told Frankie I don't.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.540
No alibi, not helpful.

06:15.609 --> 06:18.076
OK... First things first,

06:18.144 --> 06:20.044
we need to know
who you won that car from.

06:20.113 --> 06:23.848
All right then. We'll need
to take a short journey.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.556
How well did you know my father?

06:31.624 --> 06:35.126
Well, he was my boss,
and we were good friends.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.595
He talked a lot about you.
Said you spoke your mind,

06:37.664 --> 06:39.397
you had unconventional friends

06:39.400 --> 06:41.399
and didn't put up
with any flimflam.

06:41.468 --> 06:43.435
"Flimflam"? I haven't
heard that in a while.

06:43.503 --> 06:45.637
The last time was probably
with your dad.

06:45.705 --> 06:48.072
He said you were
one of his best riders.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.041
- Still got that bike?
- I do.

06:50.043 --> 06:53.411
I don't suppose, since I lost
my car, I could sort of...

06:53.480 --> 06:56.281
- No one touches the bike.
- Yes, of course.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.119
You're living
on Toronto Island in a tent?!

07:01.121 --> 07:03.121
Tent living is quite the thing
once you're used to it.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.723
How else to get away
from the sweltering heat

07:05.792 --> 07:08.560
of the city.
What are you doing here, Eric?

07:08.628 --> 07:10.361
Beating the heat.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.931
No. I mean here in Toronto.

07:12.999 --> 07:15.867
Truth is my father gave me
a oneway ticket to the colonies

07:15.869 --> 07:18.536
with the instructions
to become a man.

07:18.605 --> 07:21.272
Just as I was to play <i> Hamlet</i> for
the Amateur Dramatic Society.

07:21.341 --> 07:24.876
- Maybe it wasn't a coincidence.
- This is it!

07:24.878 --> 07:28.146
Home sweet home!

07:28.148 --> 07:30.282
Where the hell
were you last night?

07:30.350 --> 07:32.851
My boat was almost stolen; You
were supposed to be watching it.

07:32.919 --> 07:35.954
I've got bigger problems to worry
about than your bloody boat!

07:36.022 --> 07:38.556
Now that you have that

07:38.625 --> 07:41.092
out of your systems, let's make
some introductions here.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.928
This is Archie, tent mate
and otherwise acquaintance.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.998
- Yeah? He's a nogood son of a...
- We met at a poker game.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.568
- Yeah, where you were cheating!
- OK.

07:49.636 --> 07:52.003
OK!

07:52.071 --> 07:54.272
Tell me about your car.
Who wants to know?

07:54.274 --> 07:56.975
Someone who can cause
a whole lot of trouble.

07:58.344 --> 08:00.545
It was just sitting there.
I kind of borrowed it.

08:00.613 --> 08:02.581
- So you stole it?
- I was gonna put it back,

08:02.649 --> 08:05.650
but then I lost it in the game.
When did you take it?

08:05.719 --> 08:07.685
About three weeks ago.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.721
- Who's the owner?
- I don't know!

08:09.789 --> 08:12.490
Honest! What's this
all about anyways?

08:12.559 --> 08:15.093
Just lay low and try
to stay out of trouble.

08:15.161 --> 08:18.062
- Thanks.
- We'll be in touch.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.239
<i>Where do you keep
all the gadgets?</i>

08:27.307 --> 08:30.675
You know, the invisible ink
and everything?

08:30.744 --> 08:32.677
The inner sanctum

08:32.746 --> 08:35.813
of the detective agency.

08:35.881 --> 08:38.049
- Disguises!
- Mary!

08:40.754 --> 08:43.755
A fully functioning gin still!

08:43.823 --> 08:47.192
In direct contravention
of the Temperance Act.

08:50.997 --> 08:54.366
I didn't see that, ladies.
The licence plate, Mary?

08:56.737 --> 08:59.804
License plate "186148"

08:59.872 --> 09:01.740
is registered
to a Mr. John Russell.

09:01.808 --> 09:03.641
And he is...?

09:03.710 --> 09:06.978
Well, from what I gathered
from my discrete inquiries,

09:06.980 --> 09:09.380
he is a wellheeled gadabout.

09:09.449 --> 09:11.382
Seems he likes to spend
a lot of time

09:11.451 --> 09:13.919
at the Lake Ontario Yacht Club
where he's the treasurer.

09:13.987 --> 09:16.788
That's just a short walk
from Eric's tent city.

09:16.856 --> 09:19.124
- Striking coincidence.
- And there's more:

09:19.192 --> 09:22.093
Mr. Russell has not
reported his car stolen.

09:22.161 --> 09:25.129
Interesting. I wonder why not.

09:25.132 --> 09:27.131
Suspicious behaviour
if you ask me.

09:27.134 --> 09:29.133
Maybe we should pay him a visit.

09:29.136 --> 09:32.303
Good luck. The Yacht Club
is strictly members only.

09:32.372 --> 09:35.974
Right, Yacht Club...
I think I saw something.

09:39.946 --> 09:42.313
"The engagement
of Mr. Peter Bennett,

09:42.382 --> 09:45.249
"son of Lake Ontario Yacht Club
President Michael Bennett,

09:45.318 --> 09:47.652
"to Ms. Rose Adams
will be celebrated

09:47.654 --> 09:51.723
at the Adams' summer residence
on Toronto Island."

09:51.791 --> 09:53.992
Russel will most likely
make an appearance.

09:55.361 --> 09:57.562
- But how are you gonna get in?
- You're still in touch

09:57.631 --> 09:59.998
with your friends
from the music world, Trudy?

10:39.105 --> 10:41.372
There's a reporter here already.
The editor wanted

10:41.441 --> 10:44.542
to send along a photographer.
That's me. Doris Pittman.

10:44.611 --> 10:47.578
- They're a goodlooking couple.
- Do you know,

10:47.647 --> 10:49.847
has John Russell arrived?
I haven't seen him.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.640
Bravo!

11:15.642 --> 11:18.609
- Wonderful! Wonderful!
- Wonderful!

11:18.678 --> 11:20.511
Bravo! Bravo!

11:20.580 --> 11:23.014
Welcome. Welcome, everyone.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.616
I want to welcome everyone
to my home

11:25.685 --> 11:27.819
to share this day with you,

11:27.887 --> 11:29.921
to share in this beautiful view.

11:29.923 --> 11:33.091
We're here this afternoon
to celebrate

11:33.159 --> 11:35.560
this fine young couple.

11:35.628 --> 11:39.097
Peter, my lovely daughter
is now your problem.

11:39.165 --> 11:41.165
Daddy!

11:41.234 --> 11:43.935
Rose, you know I love you.
Now, everyone, I would ask

11:43.937 --> 11:46.304
that you raise your glasses

11:46.372 --> 11:50.608
to the future
Mr. and Mrs. Peter Bennett.

11:50.677 --> 11:53.344
- Cheers to the couple.
- Cheers!

11:53.413 --> 11:55.947
- Peter, congratulations.
- Hear, hear!

11:55.949 --> 11:59.584
- A beautiful day, isn't it?
- You know which one's John Russell?

11:59.652 --> 12:02.320
- I haven't seen him.
- OK, everyone...

12:02.388 --> 12:04.956
Too bad, he's a good tipper
at the Yacht Club.

12:05.024 --> 12:06.991
A bit familiar though

12:07.059 --> 12:08.993
- if you get my drift.
- More drinks here.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.962
Thanks for the warning.

12:11.030 --> 12:13.431
Thank you.

12:13.499 --> 12:15.833
I'll be back in a moment.

12:15.902 --> 12:18.903
Excuse me.
You... you're the reporter?

12:18.905 --> 12:21.005
Yes. Doris Pittman, Mr. Adams.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.108
We've been expecting you.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.309
- Of course.
- Yeah.

12:25.312 --> 12:28.112
This is such a lovely party;
You do your daughter proud.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.982
- Thank you.
- Everyone's so stylish,

12:31.050 --> 12:34.285
but none more beautiful than the
lovely Rose and her husband to be.

12:34.353 --> 12:36.287
- The perfect couple!
- Hahaha!

12:36.355 --> 12:38.489
Now, this is
for the weekend edition?

12:38.558 --> 12:42.026
- Yes siree.
- So let's make it good enough for the front page, shall we?

12:42.094 --> 12:45.797
- Absolutely. Hey.
- Hahaha! OK, you two.

12:45.865 --> 12:49.033
Look at the camera.

12:49.101 --> 12:52.070
That's wonderful. Now,
how about one with the parents?

12:52.138 --> 12:54.071
- Absolutely.
- OK. Honey!

12:54.074 --> 12:56.340
- Yeah.
- You brought a camera;

12:56.409 --> 12:59.677
How very enterprising of you!

12:59.679 --> 13:01.879
- Hemingway.
- So it seems

13:01.882 --> 13:04.148
we're a long way
from a boxing ring, Ms. Drake.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.184
(Mr.
- Groom to be.

13:06.252 --> 13:08.352
- I think that looks great!
- Ready.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.655
OK, big smiles, everybody.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.162
Why are you impersonating
a reporter?

13:18.165 --> 13:20.765
Society weddings, Hemingway?
Really? That's a step down.

13:20.833 --> 13:23.701
My editor is trying to break me,

13:23.770 --> 13:25.770
but damned if I'll give
him that satisfaction.

13:25.772 --> 13:29.106
So he'll get his boring,
predictable headline.

13:29.175 --> 13:31.543
Well, your passion
for the job is staggering.

13:31.611 --> 13:34.913
I hate this city.
"Toronto the Good."

13:34.981 --> 13:37.715
Here, you can't even buy candy
at a drugstore on a Sunday.

13:37.783 --> 13:40.852
Well, life's tough.
I'll be seeing you.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.487
Hey, hey, hey, not so fast.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.301
You're gonna tell me
what a private detective

13:45.325 --> 13:48.660
is doing here. And I know
it's not for the free canapés.

13:50.096 --> 13:52.463
- Are you onto something?
- Maybe.

13:52.531 --> 13:54.265
I knew it.

13:54.267 --> 13:57.802
Well, if you'd like me
to keep keeping quiet,

13:57.804 --> 14:00.338
you're gonna have
to give me the scoop.

14:00.406 --> 14:02.139
You're kidding me?

14:02.208 --> 14:04.876
You think I want to continue
to write thirdrate columns?

14:04.944 --> 14:07.078
I want to write
stories that sizzle,

14:07.146 --> 14:09.614
stories with real meat.

14:09.682 --> 14:13.284
My silence for your story.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.153
Fine.

14:15.221 --> 14:17.221
I am looking

14:17.224 --> 14:19.958
for a John Russell.

14:20.026 --> 14:23.094
Johnny Russell? That playboy!

14:23.162 --> 14:24.929
You know him?

14:24.997 --> 14:27.665
Yes, I know him. He'll be happy

14:27.733 --> 14:31.435
to be investigated by you.
Do you know where he is?

14:31.438 --> 14:33.905
He's not in Toronto.
He's in Havana.

14:33.973 --> 14:36.641
- What's he doing there?
- Probably buying candy

14:36.709 --> 14:39.176
on a Sunday. It's Havana.

14:39.179 --> 14:41.379
That's it?

14:41.447 --> 14:43.180
Something to do with casinos.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.316
In reality, he's probably
getting soaked,

14:45.318 --> 14:47.952
but that's just Johnny for you.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.392
Thank you.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.594
Very nice. Very nice.

14:56.662 --> 14:58.596
Thank you. Good job.

15:23.022 --> 15:26.824
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Ms. Clarke!

15:26.892 --> 15:28.426
Who's gonna tell me
what's going on?

15:28.494 --> 15:30.628
It's not really what it seems.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.897
The booze is
for medical use only.

15:32.965 --> 15:35.533
I promise.
Archie knows this doctor

15:35.601 --> 15:37.969
that writes
prescriptions for alcohol

15:38.037 --> 15:40.505
for certain members
of the Yacht Club.

15:40.573 --> 15:42.373
Think of us

15:42.442 --> 15:44.475
as a delivery service.
It's not actually

15:44.477 --> 15:46.544
illegal, strictly speaking.

15:46.546 --> 15:49.080
May I have a word with you?

15:52.785 --> 15:55.252
Why didn't you tell us you're
selling booze on the side?

15:55.255 --> 15:57.989
I know it looks bad, but it
was just a way of making money.

15:58.057 --> 16:01.092
Frankie's putting her neck
on the line for you.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.520
So if you're hiding something
else, you'd better come clean.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.811
I'm telling you, Frankie:

16:20.880 --> 16:22.747
You shouldn't be
trusting this kid.

16:22.815 --> 16:26.183
Relax. Eric may be playing
fast and loose with the truth,

16:26.252 --> 16:29.020
but he is not a killer.
You know, I don't get it.

16:29.088 --> 16:31.422
On all other cases,
you are suspicious

16:31.491 --> 16:33.624
of everything that moves.

16:33.692 --> 16:35.826
It's got something to do
with his father,

16:35.829 --> 16:37.862
doesn't it?

16:40.299 --> 16:42.200
You know what I think?

16:42.268 --> 16:44.369
Captain Morrison,

16:44.437 --> 16:47.071
wartime boss, wartime fling.

16:49.242 --> 16:51.042
And now his son shows up.

16:51.110 --> 16:54.045
Yeah. It's awkward.

16:55.849 --> 16:58.126
What happened? The war ended,
and he went back to his wife?

16:58.150 --> 17:01.085
Yes, thank God!

17:01.153 --> 17:03.254
It had run its course.

17:03.322 --> 17:05.522
No need for Eric to know
by the way.

17:05.525 --> 17:08.392
Lips sealed.

17:16.734 --> 17:18.469
Is it too late
for that cold gin?

17:18.537 --> 17:21.873
Of course not. Come in.

17:24.742 --> 17:27.078
So, how did it turn out
with the kid?

17:27.079 --> 17:30.181
It's a long story
involving a trunk

17:30.249 --> 17:32.149
and a dead body.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.852
You don't want to know.
You knew his father?

17:34.920 --> 17:37.488
He recruited me during the war.

17:37.556 --> 17:40.624
- To do what?
- I ran messages to the front.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.626
It's amazing

17:42.629 --> 17:44.628
how a gal can be so invisible.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.964
- You were his eyes and ears?
- Something like that.

17:47.032 --> 17:49.066
So there's even more
to the story.

17:49.069 --> 17:51.502
Well...

17:52.772 --> 17:55.439
it's all behind me now.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.675
What about you?

17:57.743 --> 18:00.545
You're not exactly an open book.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.648
My grandparents were slaves
in Louisiana.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.817
Now I grew up in the bayou.

18:06.886 --> 18:08.819
Mostly French spoken down there.

18:08.888 --> 18:12.289
- So what brought you here?
- When I was old enough,

18:12.358 --> 18:14.859
I went to New Orleans.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.261
Turns out I was pretty good
with my hands.

18:17.329 --> 18:18.696
Haha!

18:18.764 --> 18:21.665
Started fighting town to town,
ended up here.

18:21.668 --> 18:25.369
All on my own, just like you.

18:27.306 --> 18:31.342
- Birds of a feather.
- <i>Volent ensemble.</i>

18:41.887 --> 18:44.421
Your trunk man
was bludgeoned to death.

18:44.490 --> 18:46.090
Nasty blow,

18:46.158 --> 18:48.959
usual blunt object;
Killers are not very creative.

18:48.962 --> 18:53.231
Carpet fibres in the wound,
so obviously killed elsewhere.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.966
- Time of death?
- Between 6 and 11 on the night

18:55.969 --> 18:57.835
he was found.
No idea who he was.

18:57.904 --> 19:01.739
- Do you have the suit he was wearing?
- Mhm.

19:04.243 --> 19:06.643
He sure got his money's worth
out of this thing.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.883
Heavy smoker.

19:13.452 --> 19:14.919
Likely a pipe.

19:14.921 --> 19:17.454
Handmade. Label's pretty faded.

19:17.523 --> 19:19.657
Looks like to be a Gerber
or Gelber Tailoring.

19:19.725 --> 19:21.659
Nice work, Sherlock.

19:21.727 --> 19:24.328
Mr. Gelber and I had a nice chat
about his pipesmoking customer.

19:24.397 --> 19:27.698
- You called him?
- It was the obvious thing to do.

19:27.766 --> 19:29.867
Here's the victim's name.

19:29.935 --> 19:33.003
Thanks, Flo.

19:33.072 --> 19:36.641
By the way, the cops
found a ship's marking

19:36.709 --> 19:39.810
chalked on a steamer trunk.
The Mauritania no less.

19:39.878 --> 19:41.812
The manifest is on its way.

19:41.881 --> 19:44.048
Whoever owned it,
their name is on that list.

19:47.020 --> 19:50.421
Your victim, Buddy Steele,
he was wellknown to police.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.856
- You don't say.
- But not in the way

19:52.925 --> 19:55.960
you might think.
He was a private detective.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.829
You're kidding?
By the wear of his suit,

19:58.897 --> 20:01.599
you'd say he was a struggling one.
It's a tough business.

20:01.667 --> 20:04.702
How old?
28. He hung out his shingle

20:04.770 --> 20:07.171
when he got back from the war.
Sounds familiar.

20:07.239 --> 20:10.574
- Any idea what sort of person he was?
- Well, from all accounts,

20:10.643 --> 20:12.576
he was a bit rough
around the edges, but fair.

20:12.645 --> 20:15.746
He wasn't above
breaking the rules,

20:15.815 --> 20:18.115
although
what private detective isn't.

20:18.117 --> 20:20.117
Comes with the territory.

20:20.185 --> 20:22.086
- Do you have an address?
- Yes.

20:22.154 --> 20:25.790
His office is on Spadina.
So this guy survives

20:25.858 --> 20:28.926
the way only to end up dead
in some kid's steamer trunk.

20:28.928 --> 20:31.195
Who would do
something like that to him?

20:38.938 --> 20:41.072
Do you find this a bit ironic?

20:41.140 --> 20:43.374
Only slightly.

20:48.548 --> 20:50.681
Nice.

20:50.749 --> 20:53.150
Takes a great effort to make
a place look this depressing.

20:53.218 --> 20:55.352
Trudy...

20:55.421 --> 20:57.354
I think we found

20:57.423 --> 20:59.356
where Mr. Steele was murdered.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.959
This explains the carpet fibres.

21:01.961 --> 21:04.528
So if Buddy met his maker here...

21:04.596 --> 21:08.165
How did he end up
in Eric's trunk?

21:16.108 --> 21:18.175
Divorces and...

21:18.177 --> 21:20.645
insurancefraud investigations.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.713
It's pretty standard.
Doesn't seem like

21:22.715 --> 21:26.450
anything worth killing over.
Maybe it was personal.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.190
Frankie,

21:33.258 --> 21:35.192
look at this.

21:35.260 --> 21:37.561
Buddy was following Eric.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.466
It's Rose Adams,

21:42.468 --> 21:44.601
Peter Bennett's fiancée.

21:44.670 --> 21:46.603
So much for coming clean.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.605
I think it's time we had a chat

21:48.608 --> 21:51.475
with our client.

21:59.885 --> 22:02.753
How do you explain these?
Where did these come from?

22:02.821 --> 22:06.090
Listen to me, Eric. Your trunk is
leading the coppers straight to you.

22:06.092 --> 22:08.403
- Things will go bad very soon.
- If you don't start talking,

22:08.427 --> 22:10.628
I'll hand you over myself.

22:10.696 --> 22:12.863
No one can know
about Rose and me.

22:12.931 --> 22:14.832
So you are lovers?

22:18.537 --> 22:21.138
- How did you two meet?
- We met here, on the island.

22:21.206 --> 22:23.674
She said she hated being
cooped up at her father's place,

22:23.742 --> 22:26.944
so she'd slip out to meet me.
I was a breath of fresh air.

22:27.012 --> 22:29.580
It started as a fling,
a summer romance.

22:29.648 --> 22:31.415
Yes, because those always
end so well.

22:31.484 --> 22:35.152
- She's my alibi for the other night.
- Well, that's good news.

22:35.220 --> 22:37.788
- But I can't breathe a word about us.
- Why not?

22:37.857 --> 22:41.592
Rose made me promise.
Her father would disown her

22:41.594 --> 22:45.095
if he found out she was in love
with a Joe Nobody living in a tent!

22:45.164 --> 22:48.031
A private detective
is taking pictures of you,

22:48.100 --> 22:50.901
that detective ends up dead
in your trunk;

22:50.969 --> 22:53.437
How do you think that looks?
It's all my fault somehow,

22:53.505 --> 22:56.039
isn't it? This is horrible!

22:56.108 --> 22:59.843
How do you
two lovers communicate?

23:24.169 --> 23:25.903
Your game, Peter.

23:25.971 --> 23:28.005
It's not like you to miss that.

23:28.073 --> 23:30.908
I'm not in the mood.
Let's just call it a day.

23:30.976 --> 23:34.812
I'll get us some lemonade.

24:11.851 --> 24:15.586
- Ms. Adams.
- Who are you?

24:15.654 --> 24:17.621
I'm a friend of Eric's.

24:17.689 --> 24:19.824
I just wanted
to have a quiet chat.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.894
You know about that. So what?

24:23.962 --> 24:25.896
Who would hire
a private detective

24:25.898 --> 24:28.732
to take photos of you and Eric?
My father of course.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.567
He had me followed
by that horrible man.

24:30.636 --> 24:34.204
- Why?
- He didn't want anything to jeopardise my marriage to Peter.

24:34.273 --> 24:36.740
But you're still seeing Eric.

24:36.808 --> 24:39.643
What girl doesn't need
some excitement? And Eric is

24:39.712 --> 24:42.847
much more fun than Peter.
So why marry Peter?

24:42.915 --> 24:45.382
It's some business
arrangement for Daddy.

24:45.451 --> 24:47.451
- An arrangement?
- The family needs.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.787
Peter's capital for some project
at Ashbridge's Bay.

24:49.855 --> 24:53.023
I don't understand why.
Daddy has "boocoos" of money.

24:53.091 --> 24:55.459
And why would a modern woman

24:55.528 --> 24:57.761
like yourself agree
to something like that?

25:08.640 --> 25:10.741
So did Rose answer
your question?

25:10.809 --> 25:14.611
Rose Adams is a young woman
who is caught

25:14.680 --> 25:16.880
between what she already has...
Everything.

25:16.883 --> 25:19.817
And what she thinks she wants.

25:19.885 --> 25:22.753
The romantic allure
of vagabond life.

25:22.821 --> 25:25.522
Not that I blame her for wanting
a taste of something different.

25:25.591 --> 25:27.891
You know, I used
to envy girls like her.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.527
Everything seems
so easy for them.

25:30.596 --> 25:32.729
Yeah, but it's
much more fun working

25:32.798 --> 25:35.465
than playing badminton
on your front lawn.

25:35.534 --> 25:38.168
Maybe one day
Rose will be able to escape.

25:38.236 --> 25:41.872
Who knows? Maybe Eric will
end up being her one true love.

25:41.940 --> 25:44.875
I didn't realise
you were so romantic.

25:46.244 --> 25:48.512
Well, what if I was
to tell you that Trudy Clarke

25:48.580 --> 25:50.714
had a secret love life?

25:50.782 --> 25:52.749
Do you?

25:52.818 --> 25:54.351
No.

25:54.419 --> 25:57.955
But I never give up hope.
Now, the question is,

25:58.023 --> 26:00.658
does Donald Adams really have
"boocoos" of money

26:00.726 --> 26:03.493
after all? Yeah, I'm
wondering the same thing.

26:03.496 --> 26:05.963
- Let me look into it.
- OK.

26:20.979 --> 26:22.412
Trudy.

26:22.415 --> 26:24.314
Thanks for doing this
for me, Bill.

26:24.383 --> 26:26.216
Always a pleasure,
but I must say.

26:26.284 --> 26:28.285
I... am a bit nervous.

26:28.354 --> 26:30.154
- What for?
- I've never been

26:30.222 --> 26:33.724
to a place like this.
This?! This is nothing.

26:33.792 --> 26:36.193
Let me show you
where the real fun is.

26:43.335 --> 26:45.736
- You in?
- Yeah.

26:48.006 --> 26:50.941
- Is this a speakeasy?
- My local.

26:52.912 --> 26:56.546
Two cold teas, please.
That's whiskey.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.882
Shouldn't the police
know about this?

26:58.950 --> 27:01.151
- They already do.
- Then why is it still open?

27:01.219 --> 27:03.620
Because they come here
when they get off their shift.

27:10.362 --> 27:13.230
I can see why they do.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.667
Did you have any luck?

27:16.735 --> 27:18.769
These are the files
you asked for.

27:18.771 --> 27:21.972
Donald Adams'
last three developments.

27:22.040 --> 27:24.107
I have to get them back
to the City real quick...

27:24.176 --> 27:26.276
Jobs are hard to come by.

27:31.750 --> 27:34.951
That won't be a problem.

27:34.954 --> 27:36.753
Bill, I could kiss you.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.966
I found the money
behind Donald Adams!

27:49.969 --> 27:52.569
His business partner is
none other than John Russell.

27:52.638 --> 27:55.338
- You're kidding?
- Nope.

27:55.407 --> 27:57.340
Adams is the brains;
Russell's the money.

27:57.409 --> 27:59.209
So John Russell
is Adams' backer,

27:59.277 --> 28:02.879
yet Adams is desperate to marry
Rose into money. Yeah, why is that?

28:02.948 --> 28:06.550
We need to have a chat
with the elusive Mr. Russell.

28:11.257 --> 28:12.689
Hemingway.

28:16.929 --> 28:18.695
Half an hour, OK?

28:35.080 --> 28:37.247
Man, do you ride a bike!

28:38.683 --> 28:41.819
Why am I not surprised?

28:43.722 --> 28:46.289
Aah...

28:46.358 --> 28:49.326
if it isn't the lovely <i> chanteuse</i>
from the engagement party.

28:49.394 --> 28:51.194
Trudy Clarke.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.663
- Delighted, Ms. Clarke.
- Mr. Hemingway.

28:53.732 --> 28:56.299
- Please call me Hemmy.
- "Hemmy"?

28:56.302 --> 28:58.535
Are you kidding me?

28:58.603 --> 29:00.737
Now I assume
you career gals didn't

29:00.806 --> 29:02.706
bring me down here
to chitchat about nicknames.

29:02.708 --> 29:05.242
We need to speak
with John Russell.

29:05.310 --> 29:07.177
Can you reach him in Havana?

29:07.179 --> 29:09.179
I could try,

29:09.247 --> 29:11.448
telegram perhaps,
but it is Havana.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.450
Then, when is he
coming back to Toronto?

29:13.518 --> 29:15.652
He's usually gone
a month and a half,

29:15.721 --> 29:17.687
so he should be back
in three weeks.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.591
What's Johnny Russell got to do
with all this?

29:20.659 --> 29:22.759
Well, I'll tell you when I know.

29:22.762 --> 29:25.462
But we still have
our arrangement?

29:25.530 --> 29:27.931
A deal's a deal.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.467
All right then.
I'll see what I can find out.

29:36.475 --> 29:39.009
So Russell goes to Havana
for six weeks,

29:39.077 --> 29:40.811
he's back in three...

29:40.879 --> 29:44.214
Which means he left Toronto
three weeks ago.

29:44.216 --> 29:47.284
The same time
Archie stole his car.

29:49.722 --> 29:52.356
Look, I don't want
any trouble with the cops.

29:52.424 --> 29:55.225
I got a good thing going with
those boys at the Yacht Club.

29:55.227 --> 29:57.561
We're not here about
your delivery service, Archie.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.763
Just show us
where you found the car.

29:59.765 --> 30:03.167
Well, it was left over there.

30:03.235 --> 30:05.168
It's usually deserted
around here.

30:05.237 --> 30:07.470
That's what makes it
such a good spot to pick up

30:07.539 --> 30:09.706
the booze and take it back
over to the island.

30:09.775 --> 30:12.242
- Where are we?
- This is Ashbridge's Bay.

30:12.311 --> 30:14.778
The site of Adams' latest
development according to Rose.

30:14.847 --> 30:16.713
But what brought Russell here?

30:16.782 --> 30:18.860
And why didn't he take
his car with him when he left?

30:18.884 --> 30:21.518
There's a survey crew.

30:21.586 --> 30:24.688
I wonder what Adams
is planning to build next.

30:24.756 --> 30:26.790
I'm sure those gents
will be happy to tell us gals

30:26.792 --> 30:28.959
all about it.
Whatever it is, I'm sure

30:29.027 --> 30:31.695
Russell wasn't here
to pick up a shovel.

30:33.532 --> 30:36.433
Um, so, can I go now?

30:36.501 --> 30:38.668
Call the <i> Toronto Star.</i>
Get a message

30:38.671 --> 30:42.005
to Ernest Hemingway.
Tell him to meet us here.

30:48.080 --> 30:51.081
When did Russell
make the transfer?

30:51.149 --> 30:53.817
Really?

30:53.886 --> 30:56.386
Could you get a message
to him down there?

30:58.357 --> 31:00.490
You're sure of that?

31:02.294 --> 31:04.494
Yeah, thanks.

31:14.172 --> 31:17.040
Hemingway.

31:17.042 --> 31:19.576
Archie who?

31:19.578 --> 31:21.611
Where the hell is that?

31:27.853 --> 31:29.820
Thank you.

31:36.661 --> 31:39.763
The cabbie nearly refused
to drive me out here.

31:39.831 --> 31:42.065
I can see why. I take it

31:42.133 --> 31:44.034
there's a reason
I'm in this Godforsaken place?

31:44.102 --> 31:47.471
You are standing on the site of
Donald Adams' latest development.

31:47.539 --> 31:49.839
- Mr. Skyscraper?
- They very same.

31:49.842 --> 31:51.841
According to the survey crew,
this is to be

31:51.910 --> 31:53.977
the new wastewater
treatment plant,

31:54.045 --> 31:57.380
the largest publicworks project
in the history of Canada.

31:57.449 --> 31:59.416
And your pal Russell
is the money behind it.

31:59.484 --> 32:01.885
- That doesn't make any sense.
- No?

32:01.954 --> 32:05.021
Why not? Word is Russell's moving
all his capital to Havana.

32:05.090 --> 32:07.557
Casinos being far sexier
than sewage,

32:07.626 --> 32:09.526
I suppose.
Any luck reaching Mr. Russell?

32:09.594 --> 32:12.896
Let me guess.
He never arrived in Havana.

32:12.898 --> 32:15.465
- How do you know that?
- We have a theory.

32:15.533 --> 32:18.335
Come on. Where the hell
are you taking me?

32:18.403 --> 32:21.104
Sizzle comes at a price, Hemmy.

32:25.711 --> 32:29.012
John Russell drove
his car here three weeks ago.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.780
How do you know this?

32:30.849 --> 32:33.683
A kid thought the car
was abandoned and stole it,

32:33.752 --> 32:35.919
but the theft
was never reported.

32:35.921 --> 32:38.922
- Why wouldn't Johnny report it?
- Good question.

32:42.460 --> 32:45.895
<i>To talk to his business partner
Donald Adams,</i>

32:45.898 --> 32:47.942
<i>to let him know the he wants
to pull out of the deal</i>

32:47.966 --> 32:51.968
because casinos are "far sexier
than sewage" after all.

32:52.037 --> 32:55.205
<i>There's a heatofthemoment argument over
Russell moving his money to Havana</i>

32:55.273 --> 32:58.074
<i>abandoning Adams.
It would have ruined him.</i>

32:58.143 --> 33:02.078
A confrontation happens,
then Adams loses his cool.

33:02.147 --> 33:04.514
<i>One thing leads to another...</i>

33:07.753 --> 33:11.054
It all sounds quite sensational.

33:11.122 --> 33:13.256
I take it you ladies
brought me down here

33:13.324 --> 33:15.725
to help look for Johnny's body.

33:15.794 --> 33:18.294
No. We brought you down here

33:18.363 --> 33:20.664
to identify Johnny's body.

33:48.293 --> 33:51.228
Can the gin in this place
be trusted?

33:52.864 --> 33:54.497
This is a whiskey joint, Hemmy.

33:54.566 --> 33:56.800
Hello, Frankie.

33:56.868 --> 33:59.135
Your usual? "Cold tea"?

33:59.204 --> 34:00.904
Thank you, Wendy.

34:00.972 --> 34:03.740
I'd rather have my "cold tea"

34:03.808 --> 34:06.076
on the rocks
with a splash of seltzer.

34:06.144 --> 34:08.478
Of course you would.

34:10.348 --> 34:12.315
To Johnny.

34:12.384 --> 34:16.485
Rest his soul. And damn
the bastard that killed him.

34:19.658 --> 34:21.690
So...

34:21.760 --> 34:24.860
why is a private detective dead?

34:24.929 --> 34:27.764
Maybe Buddy Steele also figured
out that Adams killed Russell.

34:27.831 --> 34:31.367
So Adams decided to take care
of him as well.

34:31.436 --> 34:34.704
OK, then why put the body
in the kid's steamer trunk?

34:34.772 --> 34:37.574
- It's the perfect frame.
- How?

34:37.576 --> 34:40.176
Buddy had photos
of Eric with Rose.

34:40.245 --> 34:42.045
Of course.

34:42.047 --> 34:44.581
"Hotheaded lover kills
private detective

34:44.649 --> 34:46.583
to protect illicit affair."

34:46.650 --> 34:48.384
It writes itself.

34:48.453 --> 34:52.922
OK, what now then, ladies?
Adams was pretty clever.

34:52.991 --> 34:55.757
- Maybe too clever.
- You have a plan.

34:55.827 --> 34:57.961
You can count on it, Hemmy.

34:58.029 --> 35:00.096
Well, you just make sure
I'm there.

35:02.668 --> 35:05.201
It will be
my number one priority.

35:08.540 --> 35:10.473
Rose's father tried

35:10.542 --> 35:12.742
to frame me for murder?

35:12.744 --> 35:15.545
And you thought your father
was hard to get on with.

35:15.613 --> 35:19.149
How do I get out of this?

35:19.151 --> 35:21.151
Well, I have a plan,

35:21.219 --> 35:22.952
but I need your help.

35:22.955 --> 35:27.290
Perhaps we can put your amateur
dramatic skills to use.

35:27.358 --> 35:31.294
Any chance it will get
Rose out of that marriage?

35:31.296 --> 35:33.296
Maybe.

35:33.364 --> 35:35.265
All right then.

35:35.333 --> 35:37.767
What do you have in mind?

35:45.243 --> 35:46.976
Good evening, Mr. Adams!

35:46.979 --> 35:50.213
Nice to meet you.
Care for a little chat?

35:50.281 --> 35:52.582
You must be joking. Leave.

35:52.650 --> 35:54.617
You might want to hear me out.

35:54.686 --> 35:56.986
It's about John Russell.

35:56.989 --> 35:59.523
I'll have a Scotch. No ice.

36:02.327 --> 36:04.094
What a terrific view

36:04.162 --> 36:07.330
you have here! You can see
the whole city! Marvelous!

36:07.332 --> 36:11.100
- You were saying?
- Your business partner, Mr. Russell,

36:11.169 --> 36:13.403
I'm having a devil
of a time finding him.

36:13.405 --> 36:15.539
- Really?
- Though I believe

36:15.607 --> 36:19.809
he's nearby. Ashworth's...

36:19.877 --> 36:22.245
Ashbridge's,
something like that.

36:22.314 --> 36:24.781
Ring a bell?

36:28.253 --> 36:30.687
What do you want, Mr. Morrison?

36:32.757 --> 36:35.725
Peter Bennett is
completely wrong for Rose.

36:35.793 --> 36:38.561
Deep pockets, I know, good
from a business point of view,

36:38.630 --> 36:40.363
but just not the right husband.

36:40.432 --> 36:43.566
I, on the other hand...
Are you suggesting that you-

36:43.635 --> 36:46.002
- Absolutely!
I'm a far better match

36:46.004 --> 36:47.837
for your daughter.
This is absurd.

36:47.905 --> 36:50.773
Is it really? I mean,
as your soninlaw, I would be

36:50.776 --> 36:53.576
honourbound to protect
the family secrets.

36:53.645 --> 36:56.613
I wouldn't breathe a word
about anything.

36:56.681 --> 36:58.815
Not a thing.

37:00.184 --> 37:02.118
I think it's time
for you to leave.

37:02.186 --> 37:05.822
- You sure?
- We have nothing more to talk about.

37:08.793 --> 37:10.893
One more thing:

37:10.962 --> 37:13.496
You might want to check
your cufflinks drawer.

37:13.565 --> 37:16.633
Rose lent me a rather handsome
monogrammed pair.

37:16.701 --> 37:18.668
One may have somehow ended up

37:18.736 --> 37:22.739
on the person
of poor Mr. Russell. But...

37:22.741 --> 37:25.475
why don't I leave you
to think about it, Mr. Adams.

38:03.548 --> 38:05.248
What's your game?

38:05.250 --> 38:08.651
I could ask the same of you.
Why did you do it?

38:08.720 --> 38:11.960
Because we were gonna make a fortune
together until Russell left me high and dry.

38:11.989 --> 38:15.191
That's why. I didn't mean
to kill him, though.

38:15.259 --> 38:18.795
But you did kill Buddy Steele
and frame me.

38:18.863 --> 38:20.797
I don't take kindly
to being blackmailed,

38:20.865 --> 38:22.498
so you tell me.

38:22.501 --> 38:26.235
In the drawer where you left
them, I should think.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.505
I'm not quite
the freshofftheboat chap

38:28.573 --> 38:30.774
you thought I was. You bastard!

38:45.156 --> 38:47.457
Did you get that, Hemmy?

38:47.525 --> 38:49.993
Ringside seat, Ms. Drake.

39:02.641 --> 39:04.874
Standing up to my father
like that,

39:04.942 --> 39:07.377
you were so brave.
It was nothing really.

39:07.445 --> 39:09.379
What any chap would do
to win his girl.

39:09.447 --> 39:11.381
- Haha! I'm your girl?
- Of course you are.

39:11.449 --> 39:13.383
What? You think I'm your girl?

39:13.385 --> 39:15.818
Well, you are, aren't you?

39:15.887 --> 39:18.821
Darling Eric, it's been
so much fun and everything,

39:18.890 --> 39:21.724
but it was just that, wasn't it?
You know, fun for the summer.

39:21.727 --> 39:24.727
You mean, you're going
to marry Peter after all?

39:24.730 --> 39:26.663
Peter? No, of course I'm not.

39:26.731 --> 39:28.965
My father's in jail
and all the money's gone.

39:29.033 --> 39:31.434
So I'm free as a bird.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.343
Our last kiss by the water.

39:40.411 --> 39:43.312
Could there be
a more perfect ending?

39:50.755 --> 39:53.055
And decks Adams
with this right hook.

39:53.124 --> 39:55.692
He went down like he was hit
with a sack of marbles.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.727
It was a thing of beauty.

39:57.795 --> 40:00.496
He's lucky she didn't
hit him with her left!

40:00.499 --> 40:03.366
He's still be out cold.

40:03.368 --> 40:05.802
She's some kind of fireball.

40:05.870 --> 40:07.971
No one like her.

40:12.110 --> 40:15.779
You were absolutely right
about summer romances.

40:15.847 --> 40:18.915
- Sorry about that.
- I will get over it.

40:18.983 --> 40:21.551
Rose isn't the only one
who's free, thanks to you.

40:21.619 --> 40:24.120
Free? What about your bill?

40:24.189 --> 40:25.855
That.

40:25.924 --> 40:28.024
I can pay for that over time.

40:28.092 --> 40:30.827
I got a few things on the go.
Really?

40:30.829 --> 40:34.964
Nothing you need to know
about, let's leave it at that.

40:35.032 --> 40:37.200
Maybe you can put
your acting skills to use again.

40:37.268 --> 40:39.936
You certainly fooled
Donald Adams.

40:40.004 --> 40:42.905
Maybe you can tell Cap that.

40:42.974 --> 40:45.508
Actually, maybe Cap
doesn't need to know

40:45.576 --> 40:47.510
about any of this.

40:47.578 --> 40:50.380
First rule of being
a private detective...

40:52.817 --> 40:56.419
no one needs to know anything.

41:01.058 --> 41:03.125
Guess it's time to go.

41:03.194 --> 41:05.361
I have that train to catch.

41:05.429 --> 41:07.163
I'll walk you to the station.

41:07.231 --> 41:10.600
Off to challenge
Jack Dempsey, no doubt.

41:10.668 --> 41:12.869
As a matter of fact, I am.

41:15.706 --> 41:18.808
Good night, Mr. Hemingway.

41:22.280 --> 41:25.915
Well then, Ahem!

41:25.984 --> 41:29.085
Good luck, Mr. Page.

41:29.153 --> 41:31.354
Thank you.

41:44.202 --> 41:46.969
What's with the notes? Thought
you already had your story.

41:46.972 --> 41:49.772
I did, for the paper.

41:49.840 --> 41:52.842
Something else in mind?
A book maybe?

41:52.910 --> 41:55.478
The thought had crossed my mind.

41:55.546 --> 41:57.647
So many intriguing characters:

41:57.715 --> 42:00.816
The dead man in the trunk,
the desperate millionaire,

42:00.885 --> 42:03.553
the singing private detective...

42:03.555 --> 42:05.655
I think

42:05.723 --> 42:08.424
there's one character you find
particularly intriguing.

42:09.761 --> 42:12.328
- And who might that be?
- I've seen

42:12.396 --> 42:15.431
the way you look at her.
Frankie?

42:16.901 --> 42:19.769
Her and I are oil and water.

42:19.771 --> 42:22.405
From the first moment I saw her.
The Callahan case?

42:22.473 --> 42:24.473
That's right.

42:24.542 --> 42:28.511
From when I first saw her,
she... irritated me.

42:28.579 --> 42:31.080
Well, just so you know,
the feeling's mutual.

42:31.149 --> 42:32.982
Well, there you go.

42:33.051 --> 42:35.351
But you know what they say
about opposites.

42:35.353 --> 42:37.186
Please.

42:37.255 --> 42:39.055
Besides, she clearly
has someone.

42:39.123 --> 42:42.125
Let me tell you a little secret
about Frankie Drake, Hemmy.

42:42.193 --> 42:44.226
A relationship

42:44.229 --> 42:46.262
with her can be
very complicated.

42:51.136 --> 42:54.704
Hold on.

42:56.273 --> 42:58.007
Before we go out there...

43:01.512 --> 43:03.913
Where we can't do this.

43:04.305 --> 43:10.246
