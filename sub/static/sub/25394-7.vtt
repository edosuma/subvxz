WEBVTT

00:01.784 --> 00:04.439
Previously onSalvation...Do we have a materials expert?

00:04.482 --> 00:06.441
Dr. Aguirre is
supposed to be here, but...

00:06.484 --> 00:08.138
LIAM: I know.
Raul Aguirre was a no-show.

00:08.182 --> 00:09.792
We're reaching out to
all corners of the
world to find him.

00:09.835 --> 00:11.054
Of all the bomb shelters
in all the world,

00:11.098 --> 00:12.664
he walks into mine.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.579
You never mentioned you were
an environmental engineer.

00:14.623 --> 00:15.841
FIONA:
You never mentioned

00:15.885 --> 00:17.452
you were the
secretary of defense.

00:17.495 --> 00:18.931
We have an abandoned
supercollider

00:18.975 --> 00:20.411
we're turning into a rail gun.

00:20.455 --> 00:23.240
Ms. Lane, your credentials
are impeccable. You're hired.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.763
This is Detective Alonzo Carter.

00:24.807 --> 00:26.591
Her grateful father.

00:26.635 --> 00:28.245
Your daughter got me a copy
of my sister's autopsy.

00:28.289 --> 00:29.681
Sister?

00:29.725 --> 00:31.466
GRACE:
I need to turn myself in.

00:31.509 --> 00:33.946
No good can come from that.I can't live
like this anymore.

00:33.990 --> 00:35.774
Once you turn yourself in,
there's no going back.

00:35.818 --> 00:36.949
But I killed Claire Rayburn.

00:36.993 --> 00:38.951
We can't stop the will
of the universe,

00:38.995 --> 00:40.649
so what do we do
with those emotions?

00:40.692 --> 00:41.954
ALL:
Acceptance.

00:41.998 --> 00:43.173
I accept

00:43.217 --> 00:45.436
that everything dies,
including love.

00:45.480 --> 00:48.657
RE/SYST would rather threaten
the lives of millions of people

00:48.700 --> 00:50.528
than collaborate
with Darius Tanz.

00:50.572 --> 00:52.443
I will not be
a part of it.

00:52.487 --> 00:54.532
We're gonna do things
my way now.

00:56.708 --> 00:58.101
AGENT:
The president has been shot.

00:58.145 --> 01:01.104
Darius.HARRIS: The shot came
through the window.

01:01.148 --> 01:02.888
What are you doing?
I'm not leaving her here.You can't stay here.

01:02.932 --> 01:04.760
We have to get you
to a secure...
I told you
I'm not leaving her.

01:04.803 --> 01:06.979
Please, Mr. President.

01:09.460 --> 01:13.856
My fellow Americans, we find
ourselves living in times

01:13.899 --> 01:18.034
where the unthinkable
has become reality,

01:18.078 --> 01:21.124
the unspeakable, routine.

01:21.168 --> 01:24.519
President Pauline Mackenzie
is dead.

01:24.562 --> 01:28.523
She was an incredible
human being,

01:28.566 --> 01:32.092
: a fearless leader,
a dear friend...

01:32.135 --> 01:35.530
♪

01:45.061 --> 01:49.109
♪ Time only haunts you once

01:50.980 --> 01:55.202

but I'm here today to tell you

02:14.786 --> 02:16.527
that there is still hope.

02:16.571 --> 02:20.705
This government is constructing
a planetary-scale rail gun

02:20.749 --> 02:24.187
with the power to divert
the asteroid once and for all,

02:24.231 --> 02:28.844
a herculean undertaking
that is nearing completion

02:28.887 --> 02:32.064
thanks to the tireless efforts
of scientists, engineers...

02:32.108 --> 02:34.371
Darius Tanz is president.

02:34.415 --> 02:36.721
I mean, the world's gone mad.

02:36.765 --> 02:39.594
We will test this gun
on a smaller asteroid

02:39.637 --> 02:43.728
passing through Earth's orbit
in just over two days.

02:43.772 --> 02:46.427
81 days to go and they're
wasting rail gun slugs

02:46.470 --> 02:48.777
on a passing asteroid they could
hit with their eyes closed.

02:48.820 --> 02:50.213
Something doesn't add up.

02:50.257 --> 02:53.085
Well, you're in charge now,

02:53.129 --> 02:55.218
so I guess you'd
better figure it out.

02:55.262 --> 02:56.741
...that whoever is responsible

02:56.785 --> 02:58.743
for Pauline Mackenzie's death,

02:58.787 --> 03:01.268
we are coming for you.

03:03.922 --> 03:05.185
MAN:
And we're clear.

03:08.666 --> 03:11.887
Mr. President. Justine
Kapoor. Media relations.

03:11.930 --> 03:15.020
Will you be addressing the press
at all today?I just did.

03:15.064 --> 03:18.154
You have a national security
briefing, Mr. President, in...

03:18.198 --> 03:19.373
Yes, in 15.

03:19.416 --> 03:20.939
And it's still Darius.

03:22.941 --> 03:24.247
Was a great speech.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.770
Pauline would've
loved it.

03:25.814 --> 03:30.514
Behind every great speech...
a great speechwriter.

03:30.558 --> 03:32.342
Thank you.

03:32.386 --> 03:35.519
I was hoping
you would stay on

03:35.563 --> 03:38.043
as my chief of staff.

03:38.087 --> 03:40.263
I rely on your counsel
more than anyone.

03:40.307 --> 03:41.482
I don't know what to say.

03:41.525 --> 03:43.701
Say yes.

03:43.745 --> 03:46.704
I-I know we had other plans
for ourselves,

03:46.748 --> 03:48.576
but I need you, Grace.

03:48.619 --> 03:50.230
HARRIS:
Mr. President.

03:50.273 --> 03:52.014
They're ready for us.

03:52.057 --> 03:54.973
Sleep on it.

03:55.017 --> 03:57.933
That's an order.

03:57.976 --> 04:00.631
Yes, Mr. President.

04:24.438 --> 04:26.614
Director Davis,

04:26.657 --> 04:28.616
take us through
the FBI's latest.

04:28.659 --> 04:29.834
Mm-hmm. Mr. President.

04:29.878 --> 04:31.967
President Mackenzie
was killed

04:32.010 --> 04:34.404
by a single 6.5-millimeter
rifle bullet

04:34.448 --> 04:36.450
fired from over
half a mile away.

04:36.493 --> 04:38.669
Now, the unique thing
about this shot

04:38.713 --> 04:40.715
is that the trigger wasn't
pulled by human hands.

04:42.847 --> 04:45.937
An automated firing platform.Exactly.

04:45.981 --> 04:48.200
The shooter didn't have to be
present to take the shot.

04:48.244 --> 04:50.159
Did you get anything
off the gun?
DAVIS: No.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.423
The rifle's serial number
was filed off,

04:53.467 --> 04:57.514
and the lab at Quantico didn't
find any prints or DNA.

04:57.558 --> 04:59.211
And Bennett?

04:59.255 --> 05:01.257
Bennett was in a locked
interrogation room

05:01.301 --> 05:02.302
when he was killed.

05:02.345 --> 05:03.433
Based on the autopsy,

05:03.477 --> 05:05.522
we believe your
theory was correct.

05:05.566 --> 05:07.568
A weaponized micro
drone gained access

05:07.611 --> 05:09.047
through the
ventilation shaft

05:09.091 --> 05:12.355
and delivered
a potent neurotoxin.

05:12.399 --> 05:14.226
Chaos through technology.

05:14.270 --> 05:16.620
This has RE/SYST
written all over it.

05:17.795 --> 05:19.449
We have no proof of that.

05:19.493 --> 05:21.364
Then find it.

05:21.408 --> 05:22.931
Mr. President,
we can't even prove

05:22.974 --> 05:24.541
that these killings
are connected.

05:24.585 --> 05:28.328
Director Davis, I've got 81 days
to save this planet,

05:28.371 --> 05:30.068
but I can't do that
with nuclear warheads

05:30.112 --> 05:31.548
threatening us at every turn.

05:31.592 --> 05:33.898
I have no doubt
RE/SYST played

05:33.942 --> 05:35.900
some part in all of this.

05:35.944 --> 05:38.773
We have to take them out,
once and for all.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.080
And how do you propose
we do that?

05:50.306 --> 05:52.743
Leave that to me.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.446
NEWSCASTER:
The nation mourns

05:59.489 --> 06:01.665
as President Pauline Mackenzie
was laid to rest

06:01.709 --> 06:03.711
at Arlington National Cemetery.

06:05.452 --> 06:08.803
She will be forever remembered
as a uniting force

06:08.846 --> 06:11.022
who brought
the United States back

06:11.066 --> 06:13.285
from the brink
of a second civil war.

06:15.940 --> 06:17.289
Dignitaries and world leaders

06:17.333 --> 06:19.422
have offered their condolences
and their support

06:19.466 --> 06:20.728
in this difficult time.

06:22.773 --> 06:24.514
You've reached Hugh Keating.
Leave a message.

06:25.733 --> 06:27.561
Daddy, where are you?

06:27.604 --> 06:29.606
I just need to hear your voice.

06:51.628 --> 06:54.762
Alonzo?
Hey.

06:54.805 --> 06:57.373
Is everything okay?Yeah.

06:58.461 --> 07:00.507
Come in.

07:09.516 --> 07:11.518
I couldn't sleep.

07:14.651 --> 07:18.350
With everything that's
going on, I just...

07:18.394 --> 07:21.484
got to thinking

07:21.528 --> 07:23.704
what you must be
going through.

07:26.837 --> 07:30.232
Hey, hey, hey.

07:58.086 --> 08:01.785
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

08:01.829 --> 08:05.354
I didn't...
I just, I...

08:17.584 --> 08:19.542
STENDAHL:
I'm sorry to drag you in here

08:19.586 --> 08:20.717
with all that
you're dealing with,

08:20.761 --> 08:23.633
but these calculations
are just wrong.

08:23.677 --> 08:25.461
Wrong?

08:25.505 --> 08:29.378
Rosetta, I told you to leave
the orbital dynamics to me.

08:29.421 --> 08:31.380
Darius, we're talking about
the fate of the world here.

08:31.423 --> 08:33.991
God forbid I should
double-check your numbers.

08:34.035 --> 08:35.906
And it's a damn good thing
I did, too,

08:35.950 --> 08:39.344
because unless you're using
some new math nonsense,

08:39.388 --> 08:42.391
this will cause us to miss
the asteroid entirely.

08:43.566 --> 08:45.176
I know.

08:47.962 --> 08:52.749
Then... then what is it
we're really working on?

08:57.406 --> 09:00.191
Holy crap.

09:03.934 --> 09:06.458
I know what he's up to.

09:06.502 --> 09:08.591
Hey, I'm working here.

09:08.635 --> 09:10.201
Trying to, anyway.

09:10.245 --> 09:11.855
Alycia, I know you're angry
with me, but you got to listen.

09:11.899 --> 09:13.944
Darius, the timing
for his rail gun test,

09:13.988 --> 09:15.424
it is, it's too early
or it's too late,

09:15.467 --> 09:16.556
depending on how
you look at it.

09:16.599 --> 09:18.775
What the hell
are you talking about?

09:18.819 --> 09:20.734
Right, the rail gun,
it's stationary, right?

09:20.777 --> 09:22.126
So it has to partially rely

09:22.170 --> 09:25.434
on the rotation of
the planet to aim.

09:25.477 --> 09:27.784
And this, this is 2011 QB8.

09:27.828 --> 09:29.960
This is the asteroid
he's targeting.

09:30.004 --> 09:31.614
Except here's the problem:

09:31.658 --> 09:35.226
this is the maximum firing
range for the rail gun.

09:35.270 --> 09:36.967
And so he's going to miss?

09:37.011 --> 09:39.796
Not by much. He was careful
to keep it close.

09:39.840 --> 09:42.059
Well, he's planning
to miss?

09:42.103 --> 09:44.409
No, he's planning
a direct hit,

09:44.453 --> 09:46.150
just not on the asteroid.

09:46.194 --> 09:49.066
At the time of the test...

09:49.110 --> 09:53.244
the orbiting nuke
is right here.

09:53.288 --> 09:56.073
You're trying to shoot
down RE/SYST's warheads

09:56.117 --> 09:57.509
with the rail gun?

09:57.553 --> 09:59.294
They've sowed chaos
and destruction,

09:59.337 --> 10:01.775
terrorized the world.

10:01.818 --> 10:03.603
The margin for error is tiny,

10:03.646 --> 10:04.995
and if we miss,

10:05.039 --> 10:07.563
it's nuclear war.

10:11.219 --> 10:13.830
Then we'd better not miss.

10:13.874 --> 10:16.224
♪

10:37.288 --> 10:38.855
My sister's body is in a morgue.

10:38.899 --> 10:40.465
Someone killed her.

10:40.509 --> 10:42.598
No. No, no. No, this is wrong.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.644
I'm...

10:46.515 --> 10:48.517
I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.040
I'm sorry.

10:50.084 --> 10:51.999
You were there
for me, Grace.

10:52.042 --> 10:54.828
Okay? I want to
be here for you.

10:54.871 --> 10:56.873
Alonzo,

10:56.917 --> 10:58.701
I need to tell you something.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.622
I have to take this.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.669
Detective Carter.

11:11.018 --> 11:13.020
What?

11:14.064 --> 11:16.066
You're kidding.

11:19.200 --> 11:23.247
Okay, all right.
I'll be right down.

11:23.291 --> 11:25.685
Claire.

11:25.728 --> 11:28.513
Someone turned themselves in
for her murder.

11:28.557 --> 11:31.081
Wh...

11:31.125 --> 11:33.431
Where are you going?To tell Nero.

11:33.475 --> 11:34.650
You may be in charge here,

11:34.694 --> 11:36.086
but Nero still outranks
you everywhere else.

11:36.130 --> 11:37.261
Hey, wait.

11:37.305 --> 11:38.698
Look, if Darius knocks out
our nukes,

11:38.741 --> 11:40.090
we've lost all our leverage.

11:40.134 --> 11:42.092
A SEAL team will be
at our doorstep in minutes.

11:42.136 --> 11:44.312
That means the end
of everything we've built here.

11:44.355 --> 11:46.270
RE/SYST can't let that happen.

11:46.314 --> 11:48.925
So you're just gonna
drop a bomb on New York?

11:48.969 --> 11:52.755
If we're attacked,
RE/SYST will respond in kind.

11:52.799 --> 11:55.453
There has to be another way.Well, sometimes
there isn't another way.

11:55.497 --> 11:58.369
Sometimes a leader has to choose
between the lesser of two evils.

11:58.413 --> 12:00.458
Well, we said we were gonna
do things my way,

12:00.502 --> 12:02.330
and nuking cities is not my way.

12:02.373 --> 12:04.201
I didn't think it
was yours either.

12:04.245 --> 12:05.812
Of course it's not,

12:05.855 --> 12:07.770
but we've got to protect
that solar sail.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.337
We're on the verge
of solving it,

12:09.380 --> 12:11.513
and I'm not gonna give it
to the United States government

12:11.556 --> 12:12.732
without a fight.A fight?

12:12.775 --> 12:15.256
You're talking
about executing millions

12:15.299 --> 12:16.692
of men, women, and children.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.215
This is not some
line of code

12:18.259 --> 12:20.087
that can just be rewritten
over and over again.

12:20.130 --> 12:24.439
Once you do this, those people
are gone... forever.

12:24.482 --> 12:27.921
You've got 24 hours,
then I'm informing Nero,

12:27.964 --> 12:29.531
who won't hesitate
to do what's necessary.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.190
Do you have a name?

12:36.233 --> 12:38.453
Not yet.

12:38.496 --> 12:39.541
The confession is sealed

12:39.584 --> 12:42.544
for 90 days,

12:42.587 --> 12:44.459
some kind
of national security thing.

12:44.502 --> 12:46.374
Hmm.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.245
But I have friends
at the Bureau.

12:48.289 --> 12:50.378
I'll squeeze them for info.

12:50.421 --> 12:53.729
Wh-What are you gonna do
when you get the information?

12:53.773 --> 12:55.905
Get justice.

12:55.949 --> 13:00.214
Hey, look, um,
I'm sorry about the, uh...

13:02.390 --> 13:04.566
What did you want to tell me?

13:09.049 --> 13:12.400
It can wait.

13:26.893 --> 13:29.330
Come on. Come on.

13:29.373 --> 13:31.462
You've reached Hugh Keating.
Leave a message.

13:39.296 --> 13:43.300
How the hell is
all this connected?

13:45.563 --> 13:46.564
You think this is over?

13:47.783 --> 13:49.437
This is just the beginning.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.494
So you've given up
on sleep altogether?

14:03.538 --> 14:05.714
Looks like I'm not the only one.

14:05.757 --> 14:07.542
Darius has us working
around the clock

14:07.585 --> 14:09.587
to shore up the tunnel
for the rail gun test.

14:09.631 --> 14:13.287
I could use some shut-eye
for an hour or two.

14:13.330 --> 14:15.506
Me, too.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.465
Mr. President,
uh, Darius.

14:17.508 --> 14:20.076
Jillian, whatever paperwork
or political nightmare this is,

14:20.120 --> 14:22.426
I just need you
to make it go away.Liam's here.

14:22.470 --> 14:23.819
Security called.
He's downstairs.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.533
You look bigger.

14:42.577 --> 14:45.101
And you look smaller.
What do you want?

14:49.192 --> 14:51.194
I'm not wearing a wire.
I came alone.

14:51.238 --> 14:53.849
You can call off the goon squad
here, this is between us.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.329
There is no "us."

14:55.372 --> 14:57.113
I'm the president.

14:57.157 --> 14:59.986
You're an enemy of the state,

15:00.029 --> 15:01.944
responsible
for the assassination

15:01.988 --> 15:03.380
of President Mackenzie.

15:03.424 --> 15:05.774
RE/SYST did not kill Mackenzie.

15:08.864 --> 15:10.953
That's what they told you,

15:10.997 --> 15:12.563
but as we both know,

15:12.607 --> 15:14.217
they don't have
a very good track record

15:14.261 --> 15:15.610
when it comes to the truth.

15:18.613 --> 15:21.224
And how about you?

15:21.268 --> 15:23.879
And we know the real target
for your rail gun test.

15:25.968 --> 15:27.970
If you make any attempt
to disable those nukes,

15:28.014 --> 15:30.755
RE/SYST will retaliate.

15:30.799 --> 15:33.976
Darius, you have to be
the cooler head here.

15:34.020 --> 15:36.109
RE/SYST will never back down.
I mean...

15:36.152 --> 15:37.762
they're talking
about dropping a nuke

15:37.806 --> 15:39.851
on a major city.You're a member of RE/SYST,

15:39.895 --> 15:41.766
so...

15:41.810 --> 15:45.248
by "they,"
you mean you.

15:46.293 --> 15:49.426
I guess. Yes, I do.

15:49.470 --> 15:52.777
Good to know.

15:52.821 --> 15:54.170
Arrest this man.
He's just confessed

15:54.214 --> 15:56.520
to being an enemy of the
United States of America.

15:56.564 --> 15:57.782
What are you talking about? No.

15:57.826 --> 16:00.785
I'm trying
to make peace.

16:00.829 --> 16:02.700
Did you think
I would just let you

16:02.744 --> 16:04.528
waltz out of here,

16:04.572 --> 16:07.401
after threatening a nuclear
attack on our nation?

16:07.444 --> 16:09.707
This is insane, Darius.

16:09.751 --> 16:12.449
You're making
a horrible mistake.

16:12.493 --> 16:14.843
You're gonna have blood
on your hands, Darius.

16:14.886 --> 16:16.366
Wh

16:19.500 --> 16:20.936
Liam's been arrested.

16:22.764 --> 16:24.940
For treason.

16:30.598 --> 16:32.121
I thought we were leaving work

16:32.165 --> 16:34.080
at work.

16:35.951 --> 16:37.518
We are.

16:42.610 --> 16:44.916
You make it easy to forget
the world is on fire.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.788
Why, thank you,
Mr. Secretary.

17:02.717 --> 17:05.067
Harris?

17:05.111 --> 17:07.417
Babe, where'd you go?

17:07.461 --> 17:09.898
I-I never noticed
you, uh,

17:09.941 --> 17:13.423
you have this little scar
behind your ear.
Oh.

17:13.467 --> 17:16.209
Childhood diving
board accident.

17:16.252 --> 17:19.125
I survived.

17:19.168 --> 17:21.040
Yes, you did.
Mm.

17:38.970 --> 17:42.061
I'm guessing you didn't
learn that in grad school.

17:48.763 --> 17:51.592
The Ark, it was you.
You sabotaged it.

17:51.635 --> 17:53.724
What else have you done?

17:53.768 --> 17:55.900
Harris, I don't want
to hurt you.

18:19.359 --> 18:22.840
That scar, it's a chip
in your neck, isn't it?

18:22.884 --> 18:26.975
I asked you a question.Yes. Yes.

18:27.018 --> 18:28.324
Who the hell do you work for?

18:29.369 --> 18:31.806
You have five seconds
before I pull this trigger.

18:31.849 --> 18:33.329
Four, three, two...

18:33.373 --> 18:36.202
I don't know. I don't know.

18:44.688 --> 18:48.214
Harris...
Here's the deal.

18:48.257 --> 18:52.043
There's no positive
outcome for you now.

18:52.087 --> 18:54.176
The only thing
you get to decide

18:54.220 --> 18:58.398
is how much pain you feel before
I learn what I need to know.

18:58.441 --> 19:02.619
Now, who hired you,

19:02.663 --> 19:05.056
and who's
the next target?

19:05.100 --> 19:08.495
I had nothing to do
with Mackenzie's death,

19:08.538 --> 19:09.887
I swear.

19:09.931 --> 19:11.802
Bennett was my target.

19:13.108 --> 19:16.329
You inserted a drone
into the Pentagon air vents

19:16.372 --> 19:17.982
and pulled the trigger remotely?

19:18.026 --> 19:21.203
I had no problem destroying
a man who destroyed our country.

19:21.247 --> 19:24.380
How noble. Who hired you?

19:24.424 --> 19:26.165
I already told you,
I don't know.

19:32.649 --> 19:34.085
Wait.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.787
Halfway through grad school,
this "recruiter" approached me,

19:39.830 --> 19:43.312
said he could help
me pay off my debts.

19:43.356 --> 19:46.794
Corporate espionage stuff
at first.

19:46.837 --> 19:50.493
It got more and
more serious.

19:50.537 --> 19:52.452
And when I wanted to stop,
they made it clear

19:52.495 --> 19:55.063
that wasn't an option.You were working me
from the start.

19:55.106 --> 19:57.239
I had the right background.

19:57.283 --> 19:59.589
I was told to infiltrate
the Tanz Mars Project

19:59.633 --> 20:01.504
any way that I could.

20:01.548 --> 20:02.940
Joe Riggs?

20:02.984 --> 20:07.249
His real name was Gordon.
He was my partner.

20:07.293 --> 20:10.339
We were told to make sure that
Ark never got off the ground.

20:10.383 --> 20:12.428
Gordon was supposed to

20:12.472 --> 20:15.431
sabotage the fuel
and punctured the wrong valve.

20:15.475 --> 20:17.607
I didn't realize what he had
done until it was too late.

20:17.651 --> 20:19.261
Obviously,
I wasn't trying to kill myself

20:19.305 --> 20:20.262
or anyone else involved.

20:20.306 --> 20:22.917
Obviously.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.179
That chip

20:24.223 --> 20:26.007
in your neck--

20:26.050 --> 20:26.921
who put it there?

20:26.964 --> 20:28.966
I don't know.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.056
They sent a team to my house.
I swear.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.580
You have to believe me.

20:35.799 --> 20:37.366
People lie, Fiona.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.368
No.

20:39.412 --> 20:43.329
But that chip in your neck
can't.

20:48.377 --> 20:52.163
Harris, Harris.

20:52.207 --> 20:54.470
I'm sorry.

20:54.514 --> 20:56.733
What we had was real.

21:10.443 --> 21:14.490
No...

21:14.534 --> 21:17.537
No anesthetic.

21:23.543 --> 21:25.501
Hey, man.
Hey.

21:25.545 --> 21:27.764
So I got some good news,
some bad news.

21:27.808 --> 21:30.027
Hmm. I'll take
the bad straight-up.

21:30.071 --> 21:31.638
Couldn't get the name.

21:31.681 --> 21:32.639
It's under seal.

21:33.683 --> 21:36.295
But...

21:36.338 --> 21:39.385
I did manage to get
his booking photo.

21:50.396 --> 21:52.702
Fiona had access to everything.

21:52.746 --> 21:54.791
The Ark, the rail gun,
and-and you,

21:54.835 --> 21:56.358
and you were sleeping
with her, Harris?

21:56.402 --> 21:57.881
I take full responsibility.

21:57.925 --> 21:59.796
I'll resign if that's
what you want,

21:59.840 --> 22:01.537
but right now
we have bigger problems.

22:01.581 --> 22:03.713
Oh, oh, there's-there's never
a shortage of problems,

22:03.757 --> 22:05.889
but thanks for the pile-on,
Mr. Secretary.

22:05.933 --> 22:08.152
She fooled us both, or did that
photographic memory of yours

22:08.196 --> 22:09.545
conveniently forget the part

22:09.589 --> 22:10.981
where you vetted her
for your Ark,

22:11.025 --> 22:12.983
gave her access
to the rail gun?

22:13.027 --> 22:15.986
There's plenty of blame to go
around here, Mr. President...

22:16.030 --> 22:17.640
For all of us.
We'll all have to pay

22:17.684 --> 22:19.076
for our mistakes eventually.

22:19.120 --> 22:20.991
The question is,
what do we do now?

22:21.035 --> 22:22.558
That chip from Fiona's neck

22:22.602 --> 22:24.560
is being analyzed
by the FBI and NSA.

22:24.604 --> 22:27.389
That should tell us something.
"Should"?

22:27.433 --> 22:30.740
We have a presidential
assassination on our hands.

22:30.784 --> 22:32.916
I want answers, Harris, today.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.831
If the NSA is too incompetent
to do their jobs,

22:34.875 --> 22:37.399
then just give the damn chip
to me, and I'll figure it out.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.183
Yes.

22:39.227 --> 22:42.970
Darius, you have a call
from Alycia Vrettou.

22:51.326 --> 22:52.980
Alycia.

22:53.023 --> 22:54.373
What have you done with Liam?

22:54.416 --> 22:56.157
Liam's been arrested
for treason.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.768
The suite's big enough for two
if you care to join him.

22:58.812 --> 23:02.293
How could someone
so brilliant be so stupid?

23:02.337 --> 23:04.121
Liam is a peacemaker.

23:04.165 --> 23:05.514
When you arrested him,

23:05.558 --> 23:07.516
you took away
yourprotector, Darius.

23:07.560 --> 23:10.998
Release him and call off
the rail gun test now,

23:11.041 --> 23:14.044
or RE/SYST will be forced
to drop a bomb on New York.

23:14.088 --> 23:16.133
We know your "rail gun test"
is really a plan

23:16.177 --> 23:19.093
to shoot down our nukes.

23:19.136 --> 23:20.616
Well, you won't drop
a bomb on Washington, D.C.

23:20.660 --> 23:22.052
That's too close to home.

23:22.096 --> 23:25.795
If we have to sacrifice
New York, so be it.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.452
Darius,

23:30.496 --> 23:33.368
the test is actually
an attack on RE/SYST's nukes?

23:33.412 --> 23:35.544
When the hell were you going
to let us in on this?

23:35.588 --> 23:36.893
I just did.

23:36.937 --> 23:38.417
Grace, we need
to draft a statement.

23:40.244 --> 23:42.638
RE/SYST has threatened us,
but we will not back down.

23:42.682 --> 23:44.814
Liam stays in custody,

23:44.858 --> 23:46.773
and the test goes on as planned.

23:48.078 --> 23:50.124
Mr. Cole tried
to negotiate with Tanz.

23:50.167 --> 23:53.432
We don't negotiate
with terrorist regimes.

23:53.475 --> 23:55.651
And we can't allow them
to disarm RE/SYST.

23:55.695 --> 23:58.698
Losing Mr. Cole is a blow
to the solar sail project.

23:58.741 --> 24:00.917
There are seven billion people
on this planet.

24:00.961 --> 24:04.181
Surely one of them is a capable
replacement for Galileo.

24:04.225 --> 24:05.487
He's s-special.

24:05.531 --> 24:07.184
What about Raul Aguirre?

24:07.228 --> 24:09.012
He's the one with the
nanotechnology we need.

24:09.056 --> 24:12.625
Yes, but he's off the grid,
ignored all our overtures.

24:12.668 --> 24:14.975
Well, get his attention,
LadyHawk.

24:15.018 --> 24:17.020
This disaster is your mess.

24:17.064 --> 24:19.980
Clean it up, or we'll replace
you with someone who can.

24:20.023 --> 24:22.199
Grace, what we just saw
in there is madness.

24:22.243 --> 24:24.158
He's playing a game of
nuclear chicken with RE/SYST.

24:24.201 --> 24:26.508
Darius always has a plan.I don't think this is a plan.

24:26.552 --> 24:29.206
I think this is a vendetta.
You have to talk him down.

24:29.250 --> 24:31.034
REPORTER : And for
those of you just joining us,

24:31.078 --> 24:34.168
this latest message from RE/SYST
just went viral,

24:34.211 --> 24:36.170
and it's disturbing
to say the least.

24:36.213 --> 24:39.260
RE/SYST AVATAR:
Your president, Darius Tanz,

24:39.303 --> 24:41.567
has started down
a path of destruction,

24:41.610 --> 24:45.701
just as our plan to divert
the asteroid nears completion.

24:45.745 --> 24:49.183
He has no intention
of testing his rail gun.

24:49.226 --> 24:52.534
Instead, he threatens
to use it against us.

24:52.578 --> 24:56.538
Either he releases the prisoner
and calls off his rail gun test,

24:56.582 --> 25:00.847
or we will be forced to drop a
nuclear device on New York City.

25:00.890 --> 25:04.285
You have 24 hours to comply.

25:04.328 --> 25:06.417
We are RE/SYST.

25:06.461 --> 25:07.636
This can't be happening.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.333
It is, Grace.

25:09.377 --> 25:13.120
And I think you're the
only one who can stop it.

25:18.647 --> 25:21.432
Yes, yes, of course, use
whatever resources you need to,

25:21.476 --> 25:23.260
to keep
the civilian population

25:23.304 --> 25:25.219
of the tristate area safe,

25:25.262 --> 25:27.177
for evacuations and keeping
the peace, thank you, General.

25:27.221 --> 25:28.178
Yes, sir.

25:28.222 --> 25:29.484
Good, you're here.

25:29.528 --> 25:30.746
We need to send out
a statement immediately.

25:30.790 --> 25:33.619
RE/SYST has thrown down
the gauntlet.

25:33.662 --> 25:37.840
Darius, can we talk alone?

25:39.929 --> 25:41.452
Can we have the room, please?

25:41.496 --> 25:42.889
MAN:
Yes, Mr. President.

25:52.681 --> 25:54.857
I need you to listen to me.

25:54.901 --> 25:56.772
Really listen.

25:56.816 --> 25:58.818
Baiting RE/SYST
is too dangerous.

25:58.861 --> 26:00.254
If they drop that nuke...

26:00.297 --> 26:02.865
They won't.You don't know that.

26:02.909 --> 26:04.345
You're gambling with millions
of people's lives.

26:04.388 --> 26:07.566
The only gamble is
to do nothing, Grace.

26:07.609 --> 26:09.219
We've wasted
so much time already

26:09.263 --> 26:11.221
with civil wars, assassinations,

26:11.265 --> 26:12.962
nuclear threats.

26:14.964 --> 26:17.924
I'm in a position...

26:17.967 --> 26:21.623
to finally... squash all of it.

26:24.800 --> 26:27.020
It feels to me
like this is motivated

26:27.063 --> 26:30.632
by personal grievances.

26:30.676 --> 26:33.548
Grievances?

26:33.592 --> 26:35.637
Yeah.

26:35.681 --> 26:40.076
You think I'd use the power
of the United States government

26:40.120 --> 26:41.687
to settle some sort of score?

26:41.730 --> 26:43.297
You've been under
a lot of strain lately.

26:43.340 --> 26:45.125
I'm just making sure
you're thinking clearly.

26:45.168 --> 26:47.562
I appreciate your concern, but
I don't need you to lecture me.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.172
I need you to do your job.

26:52.915 --> 26:57.137
My job is to advise
the president.

26:57.180 --> 27:01.141
Or so I thought,
but if you have no use for that,

27:01.184 --> 27:03.143
maybe I don't have a place here.

27:03.186 --> 27:05.493
No, Grace...

27:05.536 --> 27:07.843
I am not gonna be party
to this madness. I won't.

27:10.063 --> 27:13.066
Mr. President,
the chief of staff position?

27:13.109 --> 27:15.546
I respectfully decline.

27:35.044 --> 27:36.524
I don't have a lot of time.

27:36.567 --> 27:38.569
I shouldn't even be here.

27:38.613 --> 27:40.746
Well, I'm glad that you are.

27:42.225 --> 27:46.186
Liam, you need
to stop what is happening.

27:46.229 --> 27:48.231
Get RE/SYST to stand down.

27:48.275 --> 27:50.712
We're not the problem.

27:50.756 --> 27:52.845
:
Oh, my God.

27:52.888 --> 27:55.630
Darius should just leave
those nukes alone.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.851
Go about his business.
He's pushing us into a corner.

27:58.894 --> 28:00.374
Did RE/SYST have anything to do

28:00.417 --> 28:01.897
with
President Mackenzie's death?

28:01.941 --> 28:03.290
No.

28:03.333 --> 28:04.726
Think about it.
Why would RE/SYST want

28:04.770 --> 28:06.206
Darius Tanz to be president?

28:06.249 --> 28:07.729
All we're
trying to do

28:07.773 --> 28:10.166
is get our solar sails
off the ground.

28:10.210 --> 28:11.777
That's it.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.866
And I can't
do anything

28:13.909 --> 28:16.825
stuck inside here. I can't do...

28:19.175 --> 28:21.177
But maybe you can.

28:22.613 --> 28:26.052
Liam.

28:27.706 --> 28:30.665
Hey, I'm-I'm sorry.

28:32.798 --> 28:35.844
I know that I've hurt you.

28:35.888 --> 28:38.412
But I'm trying
to keep the peace here.

28:39.456 --> 28:41.241
Will you help me?

28:41.284 --> 28:43.896
Please?

28:43.939 --> 28:45.985
The chip was
a highly advanced tracker.

28:46.028 --> 28:48.074
GPS, biometrics.

28:48.117 --> 28:51.686
Whoever hired Fiona Lane was
keeping serious tabs on her.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.688
They keep their people
on a short leash.

28:53.732 --> 28:54.950
HARRIS: The insignia
on the chip matches

28:54.994 --> 28:56.343
the one in
Joe Riggs' neck

28:56.386 --> 28:58.562
and Claire Rayburn's
bitcoin wallet,

28:58.606 --> 28:59.955
which leads us to believe

28:59.999 --> 29:01.609
that Monroe Bennett
and Claire Rayburn

29:01.652 --> 29:03.263
were propped up by dark money.

29:03.306 --> 29:04.699
Very dark.So Bennett was

29:04.743 --> 29:06.962
their Manchurian Candidate
who outlived

29:07.006 --> 29:08.224
his usefulness.

29:08.268 --> 29:09.791
He became a liability.

29:09.835 --> 29:10.923
Why would this
organization

29:10.966 --> 29:12.925
sabotage my Ark?

29:12.968 --> 29:14.970
The what, we know.

29:15.014 --> 29:17.886
The why? Still digging.

29:17.930 --> 29:23.805
So we have an evil cabal of dark
money, doing nefarious things.

29:23.849 --> 29:26.895
But you can't tie them
to Mackenzie's assassination

29:26.939 --> 29:28.288
and don't have the foggiest idea
what they want?

29:28.331 --> 29:30.507
One thing at a time, Darius.

29:31.508 --> 29:33.772
Mr. President.

29:33.815 --> 29:35.774
One thing at a time?
We don't have that luxury.

29:35.817 --> 29:38.689
People are dying,
lives are at stake,

29:38.733 --> 29:39.952
and I am trying to save them.

29:39.995 --> 29:42.824
Then call off
this insanity with RE/SYST.

29:42.868 --> 29:45.740
Or more senseless deaths
will follow.

29:50.701 --> 29:52.660
Insanity.

29:52.703 --> 29:54.749
Is that what you think it is,
Mr. Secretary?

29:59.058 --> 30:00.537
Can I have the room, please?

30:00.581 --> 30:02.801
Darius...
Everyone out.

30:02.844 --> 30:06.152
Just through those doors.

30:06.195 --> 30:07.370
Won't be long.

30:11.026 --> 30:13.507
I told you to go
after RE/SYST. You...

30:13.550 --> 30:15.857
You told me to get to the bottom
of this, and I have.

30:15.901 --> 30:16.989
I followed the money.

30:17.032 --> 30:18.991
Whoever paid Fiona
was the same group

30:19.034 --> 30:20.470
funding Claire
and backing Bennett.

30:20.514 --> 30:22.037
The same group
that organized the coup.

30:22.081 --> 30:23.996
That's not RE/SYST.

30:24.039 --> 30:25.345
That doesn't mean
they didn't have a hand

30:25.388 --> 30:26.563
in Mackenzie's murder.

30:28.043 --> 30:30.176
You seem hell-bent
on proving something

30:30.219 --> 30:32.178
which the facts don't support.

30:32.221 --> 30:34.136
Here's a fact.

30:34.180 --> 30:37.966
RE/SYST is
a terrorist organization

30:38.010 --> 30:39.185
that needs to be stopped!

30:39.228 --> 30:41.143
Don't you think I know that?

30:41.187 --> 30:43.754
Then when did it become insane
to stand up to terrorists?

30:43.798 --> 30:44.973
When you start waving
nuclear bombs

30:45.017 --> 30:46.540
at millions of innocent people.

30:48.411 --> 30:50.022
Mr. President,

30:50.065 --> 30:53.677
if you insist
on going down this path,

30:53.721 --> 30:55.723
I will have to tender
my resignation.

31:31.106 --> 31:33.456
Hello?

31:33.500 --> 31:35.850
Hey, Grace.

31:37.330 --> 31:38.940
Alonzo, you scared me.

31:41.987 --> 31:43.553
How did you get inside?

31:43.597 --> 31:45.947
You know me.

31:45.991 --> 31:47.557
Resourceful.

31:56.262 --> 31:58.655
Your visitor is on her way up.

32:03.573 --> 32:05.924
Thank you
for reaching out to me.

32:07.664 --> 32:09.797
I'm Alycia. Please.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.278
Liam asked me to come...

32:12.321 --> 32:14.280
so I'm here.

32:14.323 --> 32:16.282
You're brave.

32:16.325 --> 32:18.632
Coming here alone
couldn't have been easy.

32:18.675 --> 32:20.677
Yeah, well,
these days, nothing is.

32:23.506 --> 32:26.727
Liam wants you to know
he's okay.

32:26.770 --> 32:29.991
But he also asked me
to get you a message.

32:30.035 --> 32:32.341
He wants RE/SYST to stand down.

32:34.517 --> 32:36.824
Now, what's it gonna take
to stop all this?

32:42.351 --> 32:44.353
Release Liam Cole.

32:47.661 --> 32:51.056
He must be really important
to you.

32:51.099 --> 32:53.972
He is... scientifically.

32:54.015 --> 32:56.539
Scientifically? That's
the only reason he's important?

32:57.801 --> 32:59.803
No.

32:59.847 --> 33:03.285
God, if you gave a damn
about this world,

33:03.329 --> 33:05.374
you would disarm those nukes.

33:05.418 --> 33:07.942
Honey, it's not that simple.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.510
Honey, I'm the assistant to the
president of the United States.

33:10.553 --> 33:11.946
And what are you?

33:11.990 --> 33:14.427
A hacker terrorist?

33:14.470 --> 33:15.950
A thief?

33:15.994 --> 33:19.519
Thieves steal
other people's property.

33:19.562 --> 33:22.957
I've never taken something
that didn't belong to me.

33:24.828 --> 33:26.874
Okay. I'm done.

33:26.917 --> 33:29.181
Liam is our best chance

33:29.224 --> 33:31.226
of stopping
that asteroid.

33:31.270 --> 33:33.707
Let him go.

33:33.750 --> 33:36.492
And I will get RE/SYST
to call off the nukes.

33:39.104 --> 33:40.583
So, what did you find out?

33:40.627 --> 33:42.063
Quite a bit, actually.

33:42.107 --> 33:43.891
Don't have a name yet, but

33:43.934 --> 33:45.371
made a few calls.

33:45.414 --> 33:46.937
Oh.
Oh, Grace,

33:46.981 --> 33:48.461
you work for the president.
You could probably

33:48.504 --> 33:50.202
just pick up the phone
and make a call.

33:50.245 --> 33:52.465
Actually, I can't.
It's under seal.

33:52.508 --> 33:54.467
Ah, well,

33:54.510 --> 33:56.599
doesn't really matter anymore.

33:56.643 --> 33:58.471
His name.

33:58.514 --> 34:00.386
It's already been taken care of.

34:00.429 --> 34:02.562
What do you mean?Found out where
they're holding him.

34:02.605 --> 34:04.607
Got a guy in Corrections
who owes me a favor,

34:04.651 --> 34:06.522
so, gag order or not,

34:06.566 --> 34:08.394
he's gonna make sure
justice gets done.

34:08.437 --> 34:09.873
You're gonna have him killed?

34:09.917 --> 34:11.658
That's not

34:11.701 --> 34:13.181
justice, that's revenge.

34:13.225 --> 34:14.704
It'll do.

34:16.315 --> 34:19.274
Alonzo... you can't do that.

34:19.318 --> 34:21.146
And why the hell not, Grace?

34:21.189 --> 34:23.409
Hmm?

34:23.452 --> 34:25.802
Answer me!Because it's my father.

34:27.761 --> 34:31.504
And you covered his ass...
all this time.

34:31.547 --> 34:33.071
No, he covered mine!

34:34.855 --> 34:36.683
What?

34:38.337 --> 34:39.816
What the hell are you saying?

34:39.860 --> 34:42.689
She was gonna shoot Harris,
and I stepped in.

34:42.732 --> 34:44.386
Your sister
was a traitor.

34:44.430 --> 34:46.214
I did what I had to do,
and I would do it again.

34:46.258 --> 34:48.564
Nah. You're lying...

34:48.608 --> 34:50.479
to protect him.

34:50.523 --> 34:52.133
:
I'm telling the truth.

34:53.700 --> 34:56.137
Finally.

34:56.181 --> 34:59.184
I'm sorry I lied to you.
I'm not sorry for what I did.

35:03.884 --> 35:07.322
Even the right thing
has consequences.

35:07.366 --> 35:09.324
It's time I faced that.

35:14.634 --> 35:16.592
You want justice?

35:16.636 --> 35:19.029
Take it.

35:38.353 --> 35:42.096
Nah. You're not getting off
that easy.

35:43.358 --> 35:44.838
Wait.

35:44.881 --> 35:46.970
What about my father?

35:47.014 --> 35:49.190
Hurts, doesn't it,

35:49.234 --> 35:51.888
not knowing the fate
of someone you love?

35:51.932 --> 35:55.196
Yeah, those are
your consequences.

35:59.679 --> 36:02.290
DARIUS:
A

36:02.334 --> 36:05.902
Without checking with anyone,
including me?

36:05.946 --> 36:08.209
I know it wasn't
the smartest move,

36:08.253 --> 36:10.951
but...

36:10.994 --> 36:13.083
Not the smartest move?

36:15.129 --> 36:18.263
You mean like...
the work you did

36:18.306 --> 36:20.700
screening candidates
for the Ark,

36:20.743 --> 36:22.658
allowing a saboteur
into our midst?

36:22.702 --> 36:24.138
I am sorry, Darius,

36:24.182 --> 36:26.053
but I used
your screening procedures,

36:26.096 --> 36:27.097
followed your protocol.

36:29.230 --> 36:32.190
There is no way to guess

36:32.233 --> 36:34.235
the damage that's been done.

36:34.279 --> 36:36.237
Darius... Alycia said
that if you...

36:36.281 --> 36:37.717
Alycia?

36:37.760 --> 36:42.548
The only thing Alycia is
better at than coding is lying.

36:42.591 --> 36:44.245
Alycia said that if you...
if you release Liam,

36:44.289 --> 36:45.638
she will find a way
to get RE/SYST

36:45.681 --> 36:47.117
to back down from
their nuclear threats.

36:47.161 --> 36:50.991
You had no authority
to speak with her!

36:51.034 --> 36:53.385
Liam Cole is a traitor.

36:53.428 --> 36:55.822
I know.

36:57.302 --> 36:59.478
And it breaks my heart, too.

36:59.521 --> 37:03.221
But going to war with RE/SYST--
it won't bring him back to us.

37:03.264 --> 37:05.701
Do you want this chair,
Ms. Hayes?

37:05.745 --> 37:08.269
No.No. Of course. I'm so sorry.
I should have offered this

37:08.313 --> 37:10.271
to you earlier, because
perhaps you can do better.

37:10.315 --> 37:12.055
Here. Look. Take the chair.
Have at it!

37:16.146 --> 37:19.628
Liam Cole can rot in jail
for all I care.

37:21.587 --> 37:25.199
And if you ever make contact
with RE/SYST again,

37:25.243 --> 37:27.680
you'll be rotting
in there, too.

37:27.723 --> 37:30.291
There's a saying.

37:30.335 --> 37:32.380
"Never meet your heroes."

37:32.424 --> 37:36.384
They should
add to that.

37:36.428 --> 37:38.604
Never work for them, either.

37:45.306 --> 37:48.570
Good luck, Mr. President.

38:15.510 --> 38:17.817
MAN:
Mr. Cole,

38:17.860 --> 38:20.080
come with us.

38:30.395 --> 38:32.353
Grace, you could've
been killed.

38:32.397 --> 38:36.357
I'm fine. I don't know what
Alonzo's gonna do to my father.

38:36.401 --> 38:38.359
I talked to Davis
on the way over.

38:38.403 --> 38:41.231
The FBI is going to make
sure he's got 24/7 security.

38:41.275 --> 38:44.409
He'll be safe in there,
I promise, okay?

38:44.452 --> 38:46.193
Okay.

38:46.236 --> 38:48.369
Oh, Grace,

38:48.413 --> 38:51.416
we've got another problem
that can't be ignored.

38:51.459 --> 38:53.853
Darius. I know.

38:53.896 --> 38:56.116
There's mounting concern that
he's unfit for the office.

38:56.159 --> 38:57.900
Unfit? Harris, that's extreme.

38:57.944 --> 38:59.685
Look, we have
a president

38:59.728 --> 39:01.208
who's acting irrationally,

39:01.251 --> 39:03.253
provoking nuclear conflict
unnecessarily,

39:03.297 --> 39:06.344
insisting we cherry-pick
facts to support his theory

39:06.387 --> 39:08.911
that RE/SYST was responsible
for Mackenzie's death.

39:08.955 --> 39:11.349
What do we do?

39:11.392 --> 39:14.743
Less than 24 hours till
he fires that rail gun.

39:14.787 --> 39:16.441
We have to confront him,

39:16.484 --> 39:18.573
get him to walk it
back with RE/SYST.

39:18.617 --> 39:20.401
And if he doesn't?

39:20.445 --> 39:24.797
If Darius is unstable,
we have to do the right thing.

39:26.407 --> 39:29.367
Seek congressional approval
to remove him from office?

39:41.640 --> 39:44.773
Liam.

39:44.817 --> 39:46.819
Hey.

39:52.041 --> 39:53.956
Are you okay?

39:54.000 --> 39:55.436
Yeah.

39:57.090 --> 39:59.397
What happened?

39:59.440 --> 40:01.703
I don't know.

40:01.747 --> 40:05.228
It doesn't make sense,
even for Darius.

40:07.143 --> 40:09.102
I may have...

40:09.145 --> 40:11.365
had some influence.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.323
Influence how

40:14.368 --> 40:16.370
Influence how?

40:29.296 --> 40:31.559
Alycia, it's him.

40:31.603 --> 40:33.300
Raul Aguirre.

40:33.343 --> 40:37.652
I will meet with you, but, um,
there are certain conditions.

40:37.696 --> 40:39.611
He's coming.

40:39.654 --> 40:41.482
BASS:
We spend our lives

40:41.526 --> 40:43.353
searching for a savior.

40:43.397 --> 40:46.400
Someone outside ourselves
who will

40:46.444 --> 40:48.968
relieve the pain.

40:49.011 --> 40:52.972
Truth is...
we are the saviors.

40:53.015 --> 40:56.062
And only we can choose
to focus on the bitter

40:56.105 --> 40:57.933
or on the sweet.

40:57.977 --> 40:59.326
In our quest

40:59.369 --> 41:01.241
for serenity,

41:01.284 --> 41:03.504
we often think
we need to do something

41:03.548 --> 41:05.201
or change something,

41:05.245 --> 41:07.116
when all we really need to do?

41:07.160 --> 41:09.641
ALL:
Accept the truth.

41:09.684 --> 41:11.817
Jillian,

41:11.860 --> 41:14.515
right?

41:14.559 --> 41:16.865
What truth did you accept today?

41:21.174 --> 41:23.263
That...

41:26.179 --> 41:29.051
...this is the only place
I feel safe.

41:34.666 --> 41:38.147
And you are, Jillian.

41:38.191 --> 41:40.933
You... are safe here.

41:43.892 --> 41:46.852
So, Liam Cole is back
in the ranks.

41:46.895 --> 41:48.854
Raul Aguirre is on the way.

41:48.897 --> 41:51.030
Good work, LadyHawk.

41:51.073 --> 41:53.249
How did you secure
Mr. Cole's release?

41:53.293 --> 41:55.643
I told them
we would disarm the nukes.

41:55.687 --> 41:57.863
But of course that's not true.

41:57.906 --> 41:59.865
No... it's not.

41:59.908 --> 42:03.172
We stay the course.

42:03.216 --> 42:05.087
We need to speak
with the president.

42:05.131 --> 42:06.698
BURKE:
Sorry, ma'am.

42:06.741 --> 42:08.830
He doesn't want
to be disturbed.This is a matter

42:08.874 --> 42:10.266
of national security.

42:10.310 --> 42:12.051
I'll take the heat. Move.

42:13.182 --> 42:15.184
Mr. President, we need to...

42:17.143 --> 42:19.145
Where is he?

42:20.799 --> 42:22.540
BURKE:
He was right here, sir.

42:22.583 --> 42:24.280
Well, he's
not here now.

42:24.324 --> 42:26.239
BURKE:
Code gray.
Repeat, code gray.

42:26.282 --> 42:29.329
Location report on
Goliath. Priority one.

42:31.418 --> 42:32.811
Sir, we've lost eyes.

42:32.854 --> 42:34.639
Agent, that is
unacceptable.

42:34.682 --> 42:36.075
What are you saying?

42:36.118 --> 42:37.467
We don't know
where the president is.

42:40.079 --> 42:42.081
The tunnels.

42:42.124 --> 42:43.604
He knows them like
the back of his hand.

42:43.648 --> 42:45.606
Agent Burke, sweep
the tunnels now.

42:45.650 --> 42:47.782
All right, Teams Golf and Sierra
to sweep the tunnels.

42:47.826 --> 42:49.001
I don't believe it.

42:49.044 --> 42:50.350
The president
of the United States

42:50.393 --> 42:51.743
just snuck out
of the White House.

42:51.786 --> 42:54.267
He's not the president.
He's Darius.

42:54.310 --> 42:56.617
And he's gone.
