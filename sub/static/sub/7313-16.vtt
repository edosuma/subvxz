WEBVTT

00:11.043 --> 00:12.565
[door creaks]

00:12.608 --> 00:14.956
[broken glass crunching]

00:15.000 --> 00:16.260
Light's still on.

00:16.304 --> 00:17.695
You cut the alarm?

00:17.739 --> 00:19.043
I cut the phone lines.

00:19.086 --> 00:21.043
Detectors won't signal
the cops. It's cool.

00:31.260 --> 00:33.217
[footsteps nearby]

00:33.260 --> 00:36.173
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You heard that?

00:36.217 --> 00:38.043
Somebody's up there.

00:38.086 --> 00:40.478
Hey, you're cool, right?

00:40.521 --> 00:42.173
No problem.

00:50.347 --> 00:51.478
[clattering]

00:51.521 --> 00:52.695
[gasps]

00:55.130 --> 00:57.043
Hey, what the hell
did you do, man?

00:57.086 --> 00:58.217
That guy came out of nowhere!

00:58.260 --> 00:59.695
Come on, man,
we got to go.

00:59.739 --> 01:01.173
Come on, man, move!

01:01.217 --> 01:03.956
We got to go!Oh, my God.

01:05.347 --> 01:06.782
[door slams]

01:38.086 --> 01:40.043
Morning.Good morning, Tony.

01:40.086 --> 01:41.347
Why are you so preppy?

01:41.391 --> 01:43.478
Well, probably because I
went to boarding school.

01:43.521 --> 01:45.956
But I think you mean "peppy."

01:46.000 --> 01:47.130
And that's
because it's...

01:47.173 --> 01:48.782
L.E.S. day!

01:48.826 --> 01:50.000
Les?

01:50.043 --> 01:53.304
L.E.S.: Leave
and Earnings Statements.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.130
Oh, you mean payday.That's another way
of putting it.

01:55.173 --> 01:56.695
Wait a second.

01:56.739 --> 01:57.565
This isn't right.

01:57.608 --> 01:59.956
This isn't my L.E.S.

02:01.086 --> 02:03.086
It's McMoneybag's.

02:03.130 --> 02:05.130
Somehow he makes
more money than me?

02:05.173 --> 02:07.043
Maybe they pay people
what they're actually worth.

02:07.086 --> 02:07.956
[chuckles]

02:08.000 --> 02:09.478
Morning, Ziva, Tony.

02:09.521 --> 02:12.130
How much do you make, Tim?

02:12.173 --> 02:14.869
What are you doing
with my L.E.S.?

02:14.913 --> 02:16.173
It was on my desk.It's addressed

02:16.217 --> 02:18.869
to me--
it's a Federal offense.Well, you know

02:18.913 --> 02:20.173
what I find offensive

02:20.217 --> 02:22.260
and more than a little
strange, is that somehow

02:22.304 --> 02:25.217
you make $253 a week
more than me.

02:25.260 --> 02:27.000
It's all about withholding.Yeah.

02:27.043 --> 02:28.043
What exactly

02:28.086 --> 02:29.304
are you withholding?

02:29.347 --> 02:31.608
Yeah, you're withholding
something, all right.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.739
You're too smart to hack
into the system

02:33.782 --> 02:37.043
and try and give yourself a
little weekly bump, aren't you?

02:37.086 --> 02:38.260
Or should I call

02:38.304 --> 02:39.869
Fred Seymour in Accounting
and find out?

02:39.913 --> 02:41.043
GIBBS:
Hang up, DiNozzo.

02:41.086 --> 02:42.391
Time's money.

02:42.434 --> 02:44.478
We've got a dead
Navy reservist in Arlington.

02:44.521 --> 02:45.782
Boss, did you know that McGee

02:45.826 --> 02:47.130
makes more money
than Ziva and me?

02:47.173 --> 02:48.434
Keep me out of this.I know.

02:48.478 --> 02:50.695
he gives a lot to charity,
and you should, too.

02:50.739 --> 02:52.347
The DiNozzos are
great humanitarians.
You know that.

02:52.391 --> 02:55.608
We got a dead hu-man.
Let's go.

02:55.652 --> 02:57.434
[whispers]:
Was that a pun?

03:03.086 --> 03:04.521
MAN:
Hey, why are we being arrested?

03:04.565 --> 03:06.521
Breaking and entering.But we didn't
steal anything.

03:06.565 --> 03:07.521
TONY:
You shot

03:07.565 --> 03:09.043
the victim twice.One missed,

03:09.086 --> 03:11.391
and the other just...
grazed him.

03:11.434 --> 03:13.956
Besides,
he was already dead.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.130
You sure about that?

03:15.173 --> 03:16.565
He off'd himself,
man. Come on.

03:16.608 --> 03:17.869
We just happened
to be here, man.

03:17.913 --> 03:19.130
Wrong place,
wrong time.

03:19.173 --> 03:20.478
Look, we could've taken
some of this stuff

03:20.521 --> 03:21.913
on our way out,
but we didn't, man.

03:21.956 --> 03:23.869
Was there anybody
else in the house?

03:23.913 --> 03:25.130
I don't think so.

03:25.173 --> 03:27.000
Get 'em out.

03:27.043 --> 03:28.565
MAN:
Man! Next time,

03:28.608 --> 03:30.913
I'mpicking the
place we hit.

03:30.956 --> 03:32.956
Interesting.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Doc. Hanging or the gunshot?

03:35.043 --> 03:36.565
The math.

03:36.608 --> 03:39.521
For centuries, hangings
used a standard dead drop,

03:39.565 --> 03:42.260
but then in 1872,

03:42.304 --> 03:44.652
an Englishman named
William Marwood

03:44.695 --> 03:47.000
calculated a formula
using a man's height,

03:47.043 --> 03:49.434
weight and the distance dropped

03:49.478 --> 03:52.565
to ensure
a cleanly snapped neck.

03:52.608 --> 03:55.304
So who is our
well-versed victim?

03:55.347 --> 03:56.086
McGee.

03:56.130 --> 03:57.391
Dr. Robert Banks,

03:57.434 --> 04:00.086
psychologist and Navy reservist
on active duty.

04:00.130 --> 04:02.217
High-level security clearance
at the Pentagon.

04:02.260 --> 04:04.217
Dr. Banks here clearly used

04:04.260 --> 04:07.521
Marwood's formula and
a double knot, thus ensuring

04:07.565 --> 04:09.913
the "hangman's fracture."

04:09.956 --> 04:12.565
Yeah, hoping for
instantaneous death.

04:12.608 --> 04:15.173
His goal was to fracture
the third and fourth vertebrae.

04:15.217 --> 04:17.043
Judging by the angle
of the neck

04:17.086 --> 04:19.478
and the petechial
hemorrhaging in his eyes,

04:19.521 --> 04:22.000
his efforts were successful.

04:25.478 --> 04:27.130
But who shot him?

04:27.173 --> 04:28.130
Robbers.

04:28.173 --> 04:30.652
Well, then we'll have to see

04:30.695 --> 04:32.130
which killed him first,

04:32.173 --> 04:34.826
the bullet or the rope.

04:34.869 --> 04:37.086
TONY:
Boss, local LEOs say
there's a woman outside

04:37.130 --> 04:38.956
claims to be
the victim's doctor.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.043
Let her in.

04:45.086 --> 04:46.173
Dr. Kate's sister.

04:46.217 --> 04:47.956
[gasps]

04:49.608 --> 04:50.913
Are you his doc, Doc?

04:50.956 --> 04:53.869
Yeah, and his friend.

04:53.913 --> 04:55.521
My condolences, Dr. Cranston.

04:55.565 --> 04:57.434
ZIVA: Gibbs, found Banks's cell
phone-- you're not gonna believe

04:57.478 --> 05:00.086
who called him
four times last night.

05:00.130 --> 05:02.260
Dr. Cranston.

05:02.304 --> 05:04.869
He... hanged
himself, huh?

05:04.913 --> 05:07.043
Looks that way.Well, whatever
it looks like,

05:07.086 --> 05:08.347
Gibbs, you look deeper.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.347
Robert was one of the
strongest people I knew.

05:10.391 --> 05:11.869
He wouldn't do
this; couldn't.

05:11.913 --> 05:14.434
I know someone
killed him.

05:28.652 --> 05:32.043
So, you spoke to him
last night, Doc?

05:32.086 --> 05:33.521
Several times.

05:33.565 --> 05:35.217
About what?

05:35.260 --> 05:37.565
I'm afraid the rules
of confidentiality

05:37.608 --> 05:39.739
prevent me from
giving you any details.Doc,

05:39.782 --> 05:41.521
guy's dead.

05:45.695 --> 05:47.695
Robert was a brilliant
psychologist.

05:47.739 --> 05:49.173
We went to school together.

05:49.217 --> 05:51.043
What about since then?

05:51.086 --> 05:53.043
We were close colleagues.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.608
His wife filed for divorce
a few months ago.

05:55.652 --> 05:58.391
He was having a difficult
time prior to that as well.

05:58.434 --> 06:00.304
At work?
He have enemies?

06:02.739 --> 06:06.043
He was consulting on a special
project for the Pentagon.

06:06.086 --> 06:09.217
What kind of project?The kind that gets
you killed, apparently.

06:10.043 --> 06:12.086
M.I.S.O.--

06:12.130 --> 06:14.043
Military Information
Support Operations.

06:14.086 --> 06:16.086
I'm old-school, Doc.

06:16.130 --> 06:17.521
Psy-ops'll do.

06:17.565 --> 06:19.869
Yeah, well, then you know
they use mind games

06:19.913 --> 06:21.434
to confuse and
manipulate the enemy.

06:21.478 --> 06:22.869
I know that.

06:22.913 --> 06:24.521
Credit card statements
over the past few months

06:24.565 --> 06:26.391
show that he was writing
prescriptions for himself.

06:26.434 --> 06:28.391
Oh, not true.
That's the kind

06:28.434 --> 06:30.260
of background fabrication
psy-ops excels at.

06:30.304 --> 06:32.521
Really? And you know
this because...?

06:32.565 --> 06:34.043
Because Banks invented it.

06:34.086 --> 06:36.043
That what you and
Banks talked about?

06:36.086 --> 06:37.521
We talked about
his divorce.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.521
He wanted me to start
seeing his daughter

06:39.565 --> 06:41.086
to help her
get through it.

06:41.130 --> 06:43.434
Turns out he was having just
as much trouble as she was.

06:43.478 --> 06:45.913
He was getting
increasingly anxious,

06:45.956 --> 06:47.521
but whenever
I brought up his daughter,

06:47.565 --> 06:49.391
his panic would subside.

06:49.434 --> 06:52.304
He lived for
his little girl.

06:52.347 --> 06:54.956
She was his hope,
his whole reason for living.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.608
People who have
any hope at all, Gibbs,

06:57.652 --> 06:59.608
they don't take
their own life,

06:59.652 --> 07:01.391
they embrace it.

07:01.434 --> 07:03.869
Banks didn't kill himself.

07:05.869 --> 07:08.956
WOMAN:
Forgive me if I'm having
a little trouble with this.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.130
Bobby had been
so unpredictable lately.

07:12.173 --> 07:13.608
He just...

07:13.652 --> 07:15.304
he just wanted Amber
to be happy.

07:15.347 --> 07:17.695
It's all because
they broke up.

07:17.739 --> 07:19.086
He still loved her.

07:19.130 --> 07:22.608
You made this happen.

07:24.869 --> 07:26.173
Tell me about your
relationship, Mrs. Banks.

07:26.217 --> 07:30.173
Why does any couple split
after so many years?

07:33.043 --> 07:34.695
We grew apart.

07:34.739 --> 07:37.608
He'd become...
different.

07:37.652 --> 07:39.000
He had become moody.

07:39.043 --> 07:41.130
He wasn't the man
that I married.

07:43.739 --> 07:46.000
And... he started

07:46.043 --> 07:48.304
to take it out
on both of us.

07:48.347 --> 07:50.130
Mom...
You know

07:50.173 --> 07:52.086
he wasn't the same, Amber.

07:52.130 --> 07:54.565
GIBBS:
Life insurance

07:54.608 --> 07:57.043
has you as the
sole beneficiary.
Yeah.

07:57.086 --> 08:00.565
His, um, university
and naval death benefits.

08:00.608 --> 08:02.217
He had an additional
policy, too.

08:02.260 --> 08:05.391
$4 million for
both of you.

08:08.695 --> 08:10.130
But...

08:10.173 --> 08:13.130
wouldn't the suicide
change that?
No, no,

08:13.173 --> 08:15.130
not in this case--
he had a policy

08:15.173 --> 08:17.739
that had an
exclusion clause.

08:20.739 --> 08:23.304
You sure you didn't know
about the money?

08:37.043 --> 08:38.347
Hey, finally.
You work

08:38.391 --> 08:39.956
with Fred Seymour
in Accounting, right?

08:40.000 --> 08:41.652
Uh, you need an accountant?

08:41.695 --> 08:42.913
You bet I do.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.260
I got a salary dispute.

08:44.304 --> 08:47.434
Oh. Are you feeling
overvalued or undervalued?

08:47.478 --> 08:49.043
That's an interesting question.

08:49.086 --> 08:50.782
It's not me,
actually, it's McGee.

08:50.826 --> 08:51.739
Who's McGee?

08:51.782 --> 08:54.130
My coworker.
The tall, pasty guy

08:54.173 --> 08:55.869
who wanders around
sort of... [moans]

08:55.913 --> 08:58.173
You know, he spends way too much
time indoors. Needs light.

08:58.217 --> 09:00.434
Shouldn't I be
talking to him?

09:00.478 --> 09:01.608
Technically.

09:01.652 --> 09:02.869
Mm.That's a good point.

09:02.913 --> 09:04.782
There's probably some

09:04.826 --> 09:06.782
underlying feelings
of inadequacy

09:06.826 --> 09:08.956
between the two
of you, right?

09:09.000 --> 09:10.086
No.

09:10.130 --> 09:11.826
What do you mean,
inadequacy?

09:11.869 --> 09:13.043
Did your father
ever tell you

09:13.086 --> 09:14.304
he loved you?

09:16.130 --> 09:18.434
You're not from Accounting,
are you?

09:18.478 --> 09:21.043
Why did you pretend to be?I didn't.

09:21.086 --> 09:22.130
You did.

09:22.173 --> 09:24.173
You just saw
what you wanted to see.

09:24.217 --> 09:26.869
I'm not sure I want
to see you anymore.

09:26.913 --> 09:29.043
Oh. Are we breaking up
already?

09:29.086 --> 09:30.391
Who are you?

09:30.434 --> 09:33.608
I'm Dr. Samantha Ryan,
DOD, Psy-ops Division.

09:33.652 --> 09:37.608
I've been told to come
and see a Special Agent Gibbs.

09:37.652 --> 09:39.173
Yeah, you found him.Ah.

09:39.217 --> 09:40.652
You a brain gamer, right?

09:40.695 --> 09:43.608
That's headbrain gamer to you.

09:43.652 --> 09:47.173
I oversee all military
information support operations.

09:47.217 --> 09:48.913
I understand you're
investigating

09:48.956 --> 09:51.043
the death of
Dr. Robert Banks.

09:51.086 --> 09:51.652
Agent Gibbs,

09:51.695 --> 09:53.217
word in my office.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.000
Huh.

09:56.043 --> 09:57.608
Hi, Leon.

09:57.652 --> 09:59.260
VANCE:
Dr. Ryan,

09:59.304 --> 10:01.043
what a surprise.

10:01.086 --> 10:02.739
You know Director Vance.

10:02.782 --> 10:04.043
You seem to know
everybody.

10:04.086 --> 10:05.652
Yeah, it's my job.

10:05.695 --> 10:07.086
Oh, Gibbs,

10:07.130 --> 10:09.173
feel free to ask Leon
anything you want.

10:09.217 --> 10:11.217
We go way back.

10:13.347 --> 10:15.260
DiNozzo,

10:15.304 --> 10:17.608
escort Dr. Ryan
to the conference room.

10:17.652 --> 10:19.043
Dr. Cranston's waiting.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.043
Yes, sir.

10:20.086 --> 10:21.739
Cranston?

10:24.391 --> 10:26.956
RYAN:
Hey, Director, you look good.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.173
RYAN:
Authority...

10:29.217 --> 10:32.000
suits you.

10:35.956 --> 10:38.000
I got a call from SECNAV.

10:38.043 --> 10:39.173
Oh, great.

10:39.217 --> 10:40.826
No, it wasn't.

10:40.869 --> 10:42.304
Somebody steal his golf bag?

10:42.347 --> 10:44.434
SECDEF wants to know what
NCIS is doing investigating

10:44.478 --> 10:46.086
an M.I.S.O. employee.

10:46.130 --> 10:47.391
Investigating a
possible murder.

10:47.434 --> 10:49.478
I know you're not big
on fine lines,

10:49.521 --> 10:50.652
Gibbs, but I am.

10:50.695 --> 10:52.260
This happens
to be one of them.

10:52.304 --> 10:53.608
Dead guy's Navy, Leon.

10:53.652 --> 10:55.130
That makes it ours.

10:55.173 --> 10:56.347
So,

10:56.391 --> 10:58.000
how do you know Dr. Ryan?

10:58.043 --> 10:59.826
Long story.

10:59.869 --> 11:02.565
Love to hear it.She's an old colleague.

11:02.608 --> 11:05.695
Let's just say we spent
some time together
at the war college.

11:05.739 --> 11:06.913
Ah, private time?

11:06.956 --> 11:08.913
Classified time.

11:08.956 --> 11:10.608
[chuckles]: Okay,
okay, enough said.

11:10.652 --> 11:11.826
Be careful,

11:11.869 --> 11:13.043
she's inquisitive.Yeah, well,

11:13.086 --> 11:14.173
so am I.

11:14.217 --> 11:15.043
Gibbs.

11:16.347 --> 11:18.173
Not like her.

11:25.217 --> 11:26.913
Do you exercise?

11:26.956 --> 11:29.043
I walk.

11:29.086 --> 11:30.478
Why?

11:30.521 --> 11:32.173
Because you look skinny.

11:32.217 --> 11:34.260
Skinnierthan the
last time I saw you.

11:34.304 --> 11:35.565
Gave up dairy.

11:35.608 --> 11:37.826
I'm lactose-intolerant.

11:37.869 --> 11:39.782
You always were
into the latest fads.

11:39.826 --> 11:42.608
Well, it's not really a fad;
it's a diagnosis.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.000
So, anybody want coffee?

11:49.043 --> 11:50.173
CRANSTON/RYAN:
No milk.

11:54.478 --> 11:57.043
You two went
to school together, right?

11:57.086 --> 11:58.913
Hmm, yes.
Does that turn you on,

11:58.956 --> 12:00.086
Agent Gibbs?

12:00.130 --> 12:01.173
A couple of coeds?

12:03.260 --> 12:06.086
Afterwards, she went clinical,

12:06.130 --> 12:08.043
and I went military.

12:08.086 --> 12:10.913
Verydifferent points of view.

12:10.956 --> 12:13.173
Oh, and, um,
full disclosure:

12:13.217 --> 12:15.130
we both slept with Banks.

12:15.173 --> 12:17.130
She was interested
in his mind.

12:17.173 --> 12:18.695
I...She's doing it.

12:19.478 --> 12:20.260
You're doing it.

12:21.739 --> 12:23.000
I'm doing what?Oh, the games.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.043
The nonsense.

12:25.086 --> 12:27.043
And I'm leaving.

12:27.086 --> 12:28.173
No, no, you're not.

12:28.217 --> 12:30.217
Sam, we think Dr.
Banks was the victim

12:30.260 --> 12:31.782
of psy-ops scheme.

12:31.826 --> 12:34.173
We?

12:34.217 --> 12:35.652
He was my patient.

12:36.956 --> 12:38.043
That's ridiculous.

12:38.086 --> 12:39.086
Is it?

12:40.608 --> 12:43.130
Agent Gibbs, I will answer
any question that you have,

12:43.173 --> 12:45.086
but not here and
obviously not with her.

12:45.130 --> 12:46.043
Why not?

12:46.086 --> 12:49.043
National security.

12:49.086 --> 12:50.652
Next meeting, my
office, my rules.

12:50.695 --> 12:51.565
My investigation.

12:51.608 --> 12:52.913
My friend.
Our friend,

12:52.956 --> 12:54.521
Rachel.

12:56.217 --> 12:59.782
Banks was working with
an M.I.S.O. field op
named Mitchell

12:59.826 --> 13:00.826
on an assignment.

13:00.869 --> 13:02.304
You probably
should talk to him.

13:02.347 --> 13:04.782
[phone ringing]

13:04.826 --> 13:07.478
Yeah, Doug, I'm on my way.

13:07.521 --> 13:08.565
Hey, Gibbs.

13:09.913 --> 13:12.043
Don't trust these people.

13:12.086 --> 13:13.043
Especially her.

13:18.782 --> 13:20.782
I don't follow. TONY:
Which part, Mitchell?

13:20.826 --> 13:22.043
Dr. Banks can't be dead.

13:22.086 --> 13:23.217
I just spoke to
him yesterday.

13:23.260 --> 13:24.260
He's gone.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.217
No.

13:25.260 --> 13:26.478
I would've been informed.

13:26.521 --> 13:29.173
MITCHELL:
DOD. Pentagon.

13:29.217 --> 13:31.434
There's a chain of
communication that
would've been engaged.

13:31.478 --> 13:32.043
Mitchell.

13:33.260 --> 13:34.304
He's dead.

13:37.086 --> 13:39.304
You are a reservist
working for psy-ops,

13:39.347 --> 13:40.652
yes?

13:40.695 --> 13:42.434
Former Navy.

13:42.478 --> 13:44.521
I'm not cut out for
this head game stuff.

13:44.565 --> 13:46.869
I... can't do it anymore.

13:46.913 --> 13:49.478
They're, uh...
they're reassigning me.

13:49.521 --> 13:52.217
You worked
with Dr. Banks
for how long?
Almost a year.

13:52.260 --> 13:55.000
Banks is a smart man
and a good father.

13:55.043 --> 13:57.043
He was going through
a rough divorce,

13:57.086 --> 13:58.956
an ugly custody battle.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.826
The doctor have any problems
with his coworkers?

14:01.869 --> 14:03.217
Threats or disagreements?Look, this is

14:03.260 --> 14:06.043
a restricted M.I.S.O.
field unit-- all information

14:06.086 --> 14:07.391
is case-sensitive
and has to be...

14:07.434 --> 14:08.391
We're cleared.

14:08.434 --> 14:10.130
Answer the question.

14:13.608 --> 14:15.826
It's a court order.

14:22.608 --> 14:24.173
Here.

14:24.217 --> 14:27.043
Former Marine Second
Lieutenant Kyle Baxter.

14:27.086 --> 14:29.347
Received a general
discharge six months ago

14:29.391 --> 14:32.434
because of a negative
emotional stability eval.

14:32.478 --> 14:35.434
Who wrote it?Dr. Banks, of course.

14:40.565 --> 14:42.173
Give me a verdict, Duck.

14:42.217 --> 14:45.086
Which came first, the
chicken or the egg?

14:45.130 --> 14:47.434
Well, always been
a chicken man myself.
Oh,

14:47.478 --> 14:48.434
that's my conundrum.

14:48.478 --> 14:51.043
The heart continues to beat

14:51.086 --> 14:53.869
after a hanging
for a few moments.

14:53.913 --> 14:56.608
The doctor here was shot
and continued to bleed.

14:56.652 --> 14:58.391
Now, with the amount
of blood loss,

14:58.434 --> 15:00.869
I would hypothesize
that the bullet hit him

15:00.913 --> 15:04.217
milliseconds after his neck
was snapped clean by the rope.

15:04.260 --> 15:06.304
Definitely a suicide?Without doubt.

15:06.347 --> 15:08.826
But he was only hastening
the inevitable.

15:08.869 --> 15:10.913
What are you saying?His kidney and
liver functions

15:10.956 --> 15:14.086
were deteriorating
at an alarming rate.

15:14.130 --> 15:15.521
Based on what?

15:15.565 --> 15:17.043
Abby is determining that.

15:17.086 --> 15:20.478
Suffice to say, had the doctor
not taken his own life,

15:20.521 --> 15:25.043
I would estimate he had but...
six months to live.

15:32.130 --> 15:34.869

So, I guess you're not a sucker.

16:07.391 --> 16:09.826
Or are you?

16:12.086 --> 16:13.260
All of these pills

16:13.304 --> 16:15.173
came out of Banks'
medicine cabinet.

16:15.217 --> 16:17.391
One is a benign blood
pressure medication.

16:17.434 --> 16:19.956
The other two are dangerous
psychotropic stimulants
that have been

16:20.000 --> 16:22.652
wreaking havoc on his liver
and his kidney functions.

16:22.695 --> 16:24.260
I can't tell the difference.

16:24.304 --> 16:26.260
Somebody switched out
his prescriptions, Gibbs.

16:26.304 --> 16:27.956
It's like the oldest
con in the book.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.608
Poor sucker.
Yeah.

16:29.652 --> 16:32.391
So, Banks thinks that
he's just taking his daily meds,

16:32.434 --> 16:35.304
when, in reality,
he's taking drugs

16:35.347 --> 16:37.826
that have been proven
to cause depression

16:37.869 --> 16:39.608
and increased
mental instability.

16:44.217 --> 16:46.521
Question is, by who?

16:50.478 --> 16:51.739
Chair works.

16:51.782 --> 16:53.869
I like standing.
What else

16:53.913 --> 16:55.173
do you like, Agent Gibbs?

16:55.217 --> 16:57.043
Answers.
Good.

16:57.086 --> 16:58.217
We make a great couple.

16:58.260 --> 17:00.086
I like questions.

17:00.130 --> 17:02.260
You want to tell me
something about yourself?

17:02.304 --> 17:03.043
No.

17:03.086 --> 17:04.391

nonverbal behaviors

17:11.347 --> 17:14.826

human communication.

17:14.869 --> 17:18.217
And the most honest
part of your body,
believe it or not:

17:18.260 --> 17:19.739

17:19.782 --> 17:23.217
And yours, Agent Gibbs, are
pointed directly at my door.

17:24.260 --> 17:26.391
Okay.

17:26.434 --> 17:28.304
I have a question for you.

He said he wants

A lot of them.

19:49.130 --> 19:51.869
But any one of them
could've planned Banks' murder.

19:51.913 --> 19:55.000
This could take days. Weeks.

There's got to be

to begin without a search key.

20:23.826 --> 20:25.304
a beer, Agent Gibbs?

20:25.347 --> 20:26.304
No, I'm good.

20:26.347 --> 20:27.608
You look nice.

20:29.434 --> 20:32.391
I assume what you need
to talk to me about

20:32.434 --> 20:33.826
can't wait till morning?

20:33.869 --> 20:35.565
Murders are time-sensitive.

20:35.608 --> 20:37.260
General.

20:37.304 --> 20:38.173
Dr. Banks

20:38.217 --> 20:39.652
took his own life.

20:39.695 --> 20:42.304
And I'm not sure if this is
the time or the place.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.217
Would you excuse me
for just a moment?

20:48.260 --> 20:49.695
Mm-hmm.

20:51.478 --> 20:53.826
Wow, people in this town

20:53.869 --> 20:57.434
love to talk shop
and eat cocktail weenies.

20:57.478 --> 21:00.391
I, um, I get the impression
by your hoodie

21:00.434 --> 21:02.173
that you don't really
like parties that much.

21:02.217 --> 21:04.608
No, I like parties,
when there's something
worth celebrating.

21:04.652 --> 21:06.086
Everything all right
here, Doctor?

21:06.130 --> 21:09.000
Can I be of
any assistance?Oh, thank you, Ross.

21:09.043 --> 21:10.739
Um, Special Agent Gibbs

21:10.782 --> 21:13.043
needs to speak
to me privately.

21:13.086 --> 21:14.478
And I know

21:14.521 --> 21:17.173
just the place.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.695
I'll, um,

21:22.739 --> 21:24.956
I'll just wait right here.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.434
WOMAN [laughs]:
Excuse me.

21:36.434 --> 21:39.217
Feel safe, Gibbs?

21:39.260 --> 21:41.347
Oh, I guess not
everyone in here

21:41.391 --> 21:43.826
has a security clearance.

21:46.826 --> 21:48.826
You're enjoying this.

21:48.869 --> 21:50.608
I'll play along.

21:50.652 --> 21:52.652
What do you got?

21:54.391 --> 21:56.391
[unfolding paper]

21:59.391 --> 22:01.826
"Removal of Threats
Using Drugs

22:01.869 --> 22:03.869
and Alternative Methods."

22:03.913 --> 22:06.913
It's a hell of
a page-turner, Doc.

22:06.956 --> 22:08.739
A real how-to.

22:08.782 --> 22:13.347
Driving a sane person
to suicide using pills
and sleep-deprivation.

22:14.739 --> 22:16.739
That sound familiar to you?

22:16.782 --> 22:19.173
Be very careful...

22:19.217 --> 22:22.608
with what you're... suggesting.

22:22.652 --> 22:26.173
This is a page out
of your own playbook, Doc.

22:26.217 --> 22:28.521
So I'm gonna
ask you again.

22:28.565 --> 22:31.739
What do you know
about the death
of Robert Banks?

22:33.521 --> 22:35.956
And I'm gonna
tell you again.

22:39.043 --> 22:41.000
Nothing.

22:46.217 --> 22:49.391
I'm giving you a chance
to come clean, Dr. Ryan.

22:50.956 --> 22:54.521
[sighs] Help solve the
murder of a close friend.

22:57.434 --> 23:00.434
I already told
you the truth.

23:05.173 --> 23:07.347
[whispers]:
Whose truth?

23:23.391 --> 23:26.478
Your sister used
to look at me like that.

23:26.521 --> 23:27.739
Like what?

23:27.782 --> 23:29.652
Eh, the cat who ate the canary.

23:37.782 --> 23:40.434
I didn't exactly tell you
everything earlier, Gibbs.

23:40.478 --> 23:44.217
Lot of that going around.

23:44.260 --> 23:47.347
During one of my
sessions with Banks,

23:47.391 --> 23:49.826
he mentioned a sensitive
national security issue.

23:49.869 --> 23:52.130
Yep. You still
should've told me.

23:52.173 --> 23:53.173
I know.

23:53.217 --> 23:54.695
I want to catch his killer.

23:54.739 --> 23:57.304
That makes two of us.

23:58.521 --> 24:02.434
It's not exactly a skiff,
Doc, but it'll do.

24:02.478 --> 24:04.478
There was a project

24:04.521 --> 24:06.043
called Operation Alborz.

24:06.086 --> 24:08.173
Okay.

24:08.217 --> 24:10.391
Details.
No idea.

24:10.434 --> 24:12.956
What was Banks's involvement?He didn't tell me.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.956
Well, what did he tell you?

24:15.000 --> 24:17.391
I got the sense that
someone wanted to make sure

24:17.434 --> 24:20.173
he couldn't discuss it
with anyone, ever.

24:20.217 --> 24:22.347
Someone?

24:22.391 --> 24:24.173
[phone rings]

24:27.521 --> 24:29.347
Gibbs.

24:29.391 --> 24:30.826
Boss?Yeah, McGee. Go.

24:30.869 --> 24:33.304
I've been going through
the military personnel files--

24:33.347 --> 24:34.782
all dead ends.

24:34.826 --> 24:36.043
Ryan's info didn't help?

24:36.086 --> 24:37.043
I'm shocked.

24:37.086 --> 24:38.130
Which brings us back

24:38.173 --> 24:39.739
to former Second Lieutenant
Kyle Baxter,

24:39.782 --> 24:42.565
the guy who was drummed out
of the Marines because of Banks.

24:42.608 --> 24:43.478
Pick him up.

24:43.521 --> 24:44.434
We still can't find him.

24:44.478 --> 24:46.217
[static over phone]

24:46.260 --> 24:47.695
Hello?

24:47.739 --> 24:50.347
[static continues]

24:51.304 --> 24:53.217
Is there a problem?[closes phone]

25:02.695 --> 25:04.565
Gibbs,

25:04.608 --> 25:06.086
if something's bothering you,

25:06.130 --> 25:07.260
I'd really prefer
you tell...

25:10.043 --> 25:12.304
[turns on radio]

25:12.347 --> 25:14.869
[pop song playing
through static]

25:14.913 --> 25:17.173
[radio static increases]

25:17.217 --> 25:19.304
[music playing though static]

25:19.347 --> 25:22.304
[radio stations changing]

25:22.347 --> 25:25.043
[radio static increases]

25:25.086 --> 25:28.260
[radio static continues]

25:28.304 --> 25:30.347
[static grows louder]

25:32.260 --> 25:35.434
[radio static remains loud]

25:37.478 --> 25:39.260
[clicks off radio]

25:47.826 --> 25:48.913
Is that a b...

26:06.086 --> 26:08.347
[softly]:
Good night, Ryan.

26:08.391 --> 26:10.565
Sleep tight.

26:29.043 --> 26:30.826
[grunts]
Kyle Baxter.

26:30.869 --> 26:33.130
Former second lieutenant
in the Marine Corps.

26:33.173 --> 26:35.043
Superior IQ.
Scored off the charts

26:35.086 --> 26:36.782
on the Officer Qualifying Exam.

26:36.826 --> 26:38.956
Where is he now?Last known address
was in Norfolk.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.434
He was hand-picked by the
M.I.S.O. 18 months ago

26:41.478 --> 26:42.913
for its secret ops unit.

26:42.956 --> 26:45.043
Headed by Banks.Yeah. Until...?

26:45.086 --> 26:47.043
Well, Baxter was thrown out
for antisocial behavior,

26:47.086 --> 26:48.173
violent tendencies.

26:48.217 --> 26:49.913
Eventually discharged
from the Marines.

26:49.956 --> 26:52.130
Fell off the grid
a few months after that.

26:52.173 --> 26:53.869
'Course, if we could
use our computers

26:53.913 --> 26:55.260
Nope.to dig deeper, we...

26:55.304 --> 26:56.347
No.
could...

26:56.391 --> 26:58.391
No, McGee, we can't.

27:02.304 --> 27:03.913
Where'd you get
that, boss?

27:03.956 --> 27:05.869
From my basement;
it's a bug.

27:05.913 --> 27:08.434
Find out where
it came from, the
old-fashioned way.

27:08.478 --> 27:09.913
[electronic tones playing]

27:09.956 --> 27:11.000
You're ringing, McCheater.

27:11.956 --> 27:14.130
[electronic tones continue]

27:16.652 --> 27:20.086
Boss, I only kept it
on to monitor Baxter's
incoming cell phone calls.

27:20.130 --> 27:21.956
But this call's still live.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.652
Where?
Storefront,

27:23.695 --> 27:26.043
600 block of Chapman Avenue;
looks like a cafe.

27:26.086 --> 27:27.043
That's five minutes from here.

27:27.086 --> 27:29.000
Tony, Ziva, go.

27:31.043 --> 27:33.043
Trace the bug.

27:33.086 --> 27:34.217
With or without my...

27:45.913 --> 27:47.434
NCIS?

27:47.478 --> 27:48.608
Who wants to know?

27:48.652 --> 27:51.000
Four minutes. Nice.

27:51.043 --> 27:52.869
You guys aregood.You're not Baxter.

27:52.913 --> 27:54.869
Absolutely not.

27:54.913 --> 27:57.260
Kilmer.
Ryan and I work together.

27:57.304 --> 27:58.695
Gibbs knows.

27:58.739 --> 28:01.173
Baxter left me his phone,
wanted to see if you guys

28:01.217 --> 28:03.652
were, uh... tracking him.

28:03.695 --> 28:05.086
You can have it.

28:05.130 --> 28:06.347
He's got others.

28:06.391 --> 28:07.826
Where's Baxter now?

28:07.869 --> 28:09.086
You got me.

28:10.434 --> 28:12.260
I wish you luck, though.

28:12.304 --> 28:15.478
Whoa-hoa. You think we're
just gonna let you walk away?

28:17.000 --> 28:18.521
Well, yeah.

28:18.565 --> 28:19.695
Why not?

28:19.739 --> 28:21.913
Beautiful day.

28:21.956 --> 28:23.652
You guys have a good one.

28:27.434 --> 28:28.826
Huh.

28:31.347 --> 28:34.739
A resort in Cancun?

28:37.956 --> 28:39.956
James Drenden.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.782
RYAN:
Hey, you guys.

28:48.826 --> 28:51.043
BOY:
Hi, Mrs. Ryan.

28:54.695 --> 28:57.695
How did you know where
my son went to school?

28:59.739 --> 29:00.956
H-His records

29:01.000 --> 29:02.695
are all classified.

29:05.304 --> 29:08.000
Did you follow me?

29:08.043 --> 29:09.869
Are you following me now?

29:09.913 --> 29:11.608
Am I under
surveillance, Gibbs?

29:16.086 --> 29:18.000
You hacked my records.

29:18.043 --> 29:20.608
This is my personallife!

29:20.652 --> 29:22.000
Psy-ops 101.

29:22.043 --> 29:24.347
You approach people
at their most vulnerable.

29:26.043 --> 29:28.000
You even the playing
field, Doc.Oh, you don't

29:28.043 --> 29:31.826
want to play with me,
Gibbs, trust me.

29:31.869 --> 29:34.608
[engine starts, revs loudly]

29:34.652 --> 29:37.043
I keep things
confidential
for a reason.

29:37.086 --> 29:39.521
I take precautions
because I have to.

29:39.565 --> 29:43.086
And my son is off limits.

29:43.130 --> 29:44.826
So is my place.

29:44.869 --> 29:47.608
You don't like
your own medicine, Doc?

29:47.652 --> 29:49.000
I am not the enemy!

29:49.043 --> 29:50.391
You bugged my home!

29:50.434 --> 29:52.869
VANCE:
Tell us about Operation Alborz.

29:52.913 --> 29:54.782
As I...

29:54.826 --> 29:56.608
shared with Agent Gibbs--

29:56.652 --> 29:58.304
national security.

30:03.130 --> 30:05.608
[beeping]

30:10.347 --> 30:13.260
Alborz.

30:14.869 --> 30:16.956
Mountain range in Iran.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.956
Some of the highest peaks.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.565
Apparently,
very beautiful.

30:20.608 --> 30:22.956
People flock
from all over...

30:23.000 --> 30:25.304
Less sizzle, Doc,
more pop.

30:26.565 --> 30:29.826
After we invaded
Iraq in 2003,

30:29.869 --> 30:33.826
Iran started pouring billions
into their nuclear program.

30:33.869 --> 30:36.608
Recruited scientists to
produce plutonium for them.

30:36.652 --> 30:40.173
The Alborz mission was to
use psy-op techniques...

30:40.217 --> 30:44.043
to destabilize Iranian
nuclear scientists.

30:44.086 --> 30:45.826
Cripple the enemy
without firing a shot.

30:45.869 --> 30:48.173
21st century warfare.And the Iranians got wind?

30:48.217 --> 30:50.913
Possible.
And you think
they could've done

30:50.956 --> 30:54.608
the same thing
to Dr. Banks in retribution.Look, I'll do

30:54.652 --> 30:57.000
whatever I can...

30:57.043 --> 30:59.000
to help you find
Robert's killer.

30:59.043 --> 31:01.826
I want this over
as much as you do.

31:04.913 --> 31:06.217
ABBY:
Gibbs, get over here.

31:06.260 --> 31:07.956
I processed Banks' laptop.

31:08.000 --> 31:08.826
The encryption

31:08.869 --> 31:11.217
was, like, super complex.

31:11.260 --> 31:12.260
But you got in.

31:12.304 --> 31:14.043
I did-- with a little help.

31:14.086 --> 31:16.130
I just followed the
tracks of someone else

31:16.173 --> 31:18.913
that hacked his computer,
like, way before I did.

31:18.956 --> 31:22.434
Someone was wreaking
havoc on Banks' life
using his own computer.

31:22.478 --> 31:24.043
Like, draining
his accounts

31:24.086 --> 31:26.043
and buying stocks that
he never ordered,

31:26.086 --> 31:28.217
sending
threatening e-mails.More mind games.

31:28.260 --> 31:31.000
Yeah. Even if he googled
something, he would
get misinformation.

31:31.043 --> 31:36.043
Like bogus sports scores and
even fictional news stories.

31:36.086 --> 31:37.913
He wasn't only
being drugged,

31:37.956 --> 31:39.913
his entire reality was
being manipulated.

31:39.956 --> 31:41.043
By who?

31:41.086 --> 31:43.956
From what I can tell,
someone in Mexico.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.130
I traced a ghost I.P. address
to a room in a resort

31:47.173 --> 31:48.608
in Cancun.

31:48.652 --> 31:50.913
The security video
is a little blurry,

31:50.956 --> 31:53.608
but I got an instant hit
with facial recognition.

31:57.217 --> 31:58.826
Kyle Baxter.

31:58.869 --> 32:01.043
The same guy
Mitchell implicated,

32:01.086 --> 32:04.782
and the same guy that Banks
gave a bad psych eval to.

32:04.826 --> 32:06.956
Gibbs, this is the guy
we're looking for.

32:09.347 --> 32:10.608
Boss.

32:11.434 --> 32:12.913
Can I?Yeah. Go, McGee.

32:12.956 --> 32:14.130
Embargo's over.

32:16.434 --> 32:17.869
ABBY:
James Drenden?

32:17.913 --> 32:19.565
Who is that?TONY:
That's the alias

32:19.608 --> 32:21.173
Kyle Baxter was using.

32:21.217 --> 32:23.304
Got a hit on a passport
under Baxter's alias.

32:23.347 --> 32:24.826
Says he was

32:24.869 --> 32:26.913
on a flight arriving
from Mexico City

32:26.956 --> 32:28.739
to Dulles two months ago.

32:30.434 --> 32:32.608
Two months is a long time.

32:32.652 --> 32:33.826
He could be anywhere by now.

32:33.869 --> 32:35.043
Well, according
to the IRS,

32:35.086 --> 32:37.043
he's currently employed
as a bartender

32:37.086 --> 32:38.130
in Georgetown.Why would Baxter

32:38.173 --> 32:39.869
still be using
the same alias?

32:41.956 --> 32:44.043
Honestly, Gibbs, had I known
you were looking for me,

32:44.086 --> 32:45.826
I would have been here
days ago.

32:45.869 --> 32:47.913
Yeah. Spare me
the psy-ops charm, Baxter.

32:47.956 --> 32:49.826
We can prove you
were in Mexico.

32:49.869 --> 32:51.869
Okay, so?

32:53.086 --> 32:54.913
So, drugs found
in Banks's system

32:54.956 --> 32:56.826
were manufactured close
to the resort.

32:56.869 --> 32:58.782
You had the expertise.

32:58.826 --> 33:00.043
And you were messing with him.

33:00.086 --> 33:01.826
[laughs]

33:01.869 --> 33:04.000
Wow. Yeah, they're good.

33:04.043 --> 33:05.826
You're looking
at a psy-ops package here, sir.

33:05.869 --> 33:07.304
You can't trust that.

33:07.347 --> 33:11.304
Hmm. So, they set you up
to take the fall?
Obviously.

33:11.347 --> 33:13.391
Look, Banks discharged me
with violent tendencies.

33:13.434 --> 33:15.434
Next thing you know,
I'm the fall guy.

33:15.478 --> 33:17.043
And you took the bait,

33:17.086 --> 33:18.347
hook, line and sinker.

33:18.391 --> 33:20.913
Now, why wouldn't they frame me?
It's perfect.

33:20.956 --> 33:23.652
Prove that
you're telling the truth.

33:23.695 --> 33:25.130
May I?

33:29.043 --> 33:31.652
I never left my phone
or that matchbook.

33:31.695 --> 33:33.000
Call this number.

33:33.043 --> 33:35.000
Ask for Simon.

33:36.521 --> 33:38.913
He'll straighten it out.

33:42.304 --> 33:45.913
Baxter was the best damn C.I.
we've ever had, Director Vance.

33:45.956 --> 33:47.391
For how long?

33:47.434 --> 33:48.869
He's been working undercover

33:48.913 --> 33:51.956
with the DEA
for the past 12 months.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.826
Helped us shut down smugglers
we've been after forever.

33:54.869 --> 33:57.913
He was under DEA control
for the last year?

33:57.956 --> 34:00.086
Had our eyes on him
the whole time.

34:00.130 --> 34:02.521
If you think
he was involved with this,

34:02.565 --> 34:04.434
you're wrong.

34:04.478 --> 34:07.782
Somebody real good's
been playing you folks.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.956
So the person Dr. Ryan
has been pushing, Gibbs,

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
isn't our killer.

34:22.869 --> 34:25.130
[knocking]

34:28.043 --> 34:31.217
Cranston's sessions
with Banks.

34:31.260 --> 34:32.260
She's a quack.

34:33.434 --> 34:35.304
No, she's not.

34:35.347 --> 34:37.652
She's good, and
it made listening

34:37.695 --> 34:40.000
all the harder,
'cause...

34:40.043 --> 34:44.173
he was in real trouble.

34:44.217 --> 34:47.086
Is that your apology
about Baxter?

34:47.130 --> 34:49.217
I have a job to do.

34:49.260 --> 34:52.043
NCIS was looking
into a sensitive area

34:52.086 --> 34:54.043
at a critical time.

34:54.086 --> 34:57.217
We have protocols in place
to protect our mission.

34:57.260 --> 34:58.826
It's part of our rule book.

34:58.869 --> 35:01.304
Yeah, well, I got some rules
of my own, too.

35:01.347 --> 35:02.826
Rule number 42...

35:03.913 --> 35:05.086
Don't ever accept an apology

35:05.130 --> 35:06.869
from someone
who just sucker-punched you.

35:06.913 --> 35:10.347
I didn't apologize.

35:20.695 --> 35:22.652
Do you have children?

35:22.695 --> 35:24.652
I did.

35:24.695 --> 35:27.217
But you already know that.

35:29.260 --> 35:31.782
Yes. Kelly.

35:34.217 --> 35:36.260
And I'm sorry.

35:38.347 --> 35:41.086
Hey, Doc, my feet
aren't pointing at the door.

35:45.913 --> 35:49.086
The other day,
I was picking up my son, Parker,

35:49.130 --> 35:52.260
from soccer practice,
and he was...

35:52.304 --> 35:55.260
walking toward the
car, and not once...

35:55.304 --> 35:58.391
did he look over his shoulder.

36:00.086 --> 36:02.086
And that meant everything to me.

36:05.826 --> 36:08.956
In my job, I take precautions,

36:09.000 --> 36:12.173
and I don't know
how you found him, but...

36:12.217 --> 36:15.130
I believe everybody
deserves one secret,

36:15.173 --> 36:17.217
and...

36:17.260 --> 36:19.478
I'm asking... you

36:19.521 --> 36:21.913
if I can have this one.

36:24.130 --> 36:26.869
Okay.

36:27.913 --> 36:29.652
Thank you.

36:29.695 --> 36:31.260
I owe you...

36:31.304 --> 36:34.260
assuming you'll let me know
when you want to collect.

36:34.304 --> 36:36.304
I want to collect now.

36:38.130 --> 36:40.173
Someone with your
knowledge killed Banks.

36:40.217 --> 36:42.434
I want to know who.

36:45.260 --> 36:47.956
Whoever it is
has lost sight of...

36:48.000 --> 36:50.217
who we are and what we do.

36:50.260 --> 36:52.434
You got a name?

36:57.173 --> 36:59.173
[whispers]:
Good luck.

37:15.043 --> 37:17.391
Banks's psy-ops files
are blocked, deleted

37:17.434 --> 37:19.000
or in no-go territory.

37:19.043 --> 37:20.956
Here. Try this.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.608
It's Ryan's cell phone.

37:22.652 --> 37:25.478
GIBBS:
Isolate calls from psy-ops,
government-issued lines.

37:26.565 --> 37:29.434
There's five or six
different numbers here.

37:32.260 --> 37:34.217
Cross-reference
with incoming calls to Banks

37:34.260 --> 37:35.434
over the past month.

37:39.304 --> 37:41.043
Uh, there's just one,
boss, and they've

37:41.086 --> 37:44.217
placed multiple calls to Banks
over the past two weeks.

37:44.260 --> 37:45.260
Kilmer? Baxter?

37:45.304 --> 37:46.217
No. Brian Mitchell.

37:46.260 --> 37:47.304
The psy-ops liaison

37:47.347 --> 37:48.391
who was working
with him directly.

37:48.434 --> 37:49.956
No, wait a minute--
there's a second

37:50.000 --> 37:51.260
cell number on Banks' account,

37:51.304 --> 37:52.391
and Mitchell sent dozens
of tech streams to it.

37:52.434 --> 37:53.608
Put it up.

37:53.652 --> 37:56.086
I can't.
They've all been erased.

37:56.130 --> 37:57.652
Ziva, you're with me.

37:57.695 --> 37:59.304
They're in the cloud memory,
but it'll take time.

37:59.347 --> 38:00.391
DiNozzo, dial
both numbers

38:00.434 --> 38:03.043
three times;
hang up after one ring.

38:03.086 --> 38:04.130
Boss?

38:04.173 --> 38:06.434
Do it. And keep
sending me locations

38:06.478 --> 38:08.260
on Mitchell's cell.

38:09.304 --> 38:10.695
It's a fail-safe call.

38:11.695 --> 38:13.260
It's an old spy craft trick.

38:13.304 --> 38:15.130
Means something's going wrong.

38:15.173 --> 38:17.608
Parties are supposed to meet
at a predetermined location.

38:17.652 --> 38:21.043
Kind of a rookie move, isn't it?Yeah.

38:21.086 --> 38:23.739
That's why it
just might work.

38:34.521 --> 38:36.782
Why did you
call me, Brian?

38:36.826 --> 38:40.173
BRIAN:
I came as soon as I could.

38:40.217 --> 38:42.043
We agreed it
wouldn't be safe.

38:42.086 --> 38:43.913
[exhales] This
will never work.

38:43.956 --> 38:46.739
You'll never have what you
want if you don't listen.

38:46.782 --> 38:48.130
You know what I want.

38:48.173 --> 38:49.086
You don't deserve it.

38:49.130 --> 38:50.478
You messed up big-time.

38:50.521 --> 38:52.913
I made your father
look unstable.

38:52.956 --> 38:55.173
I gave him the drugs;
I did what you said.

38:55.217 --> 38:58.086
I said to make it look
like he killed himself.

38:58.130 --> 39:01.000
If they figure out
I'm involved,
I'll get nothing.

39:01.043 --> 39:02.347
I want that money.

39:02.391 --> 39:04.000
I just want you to be happy.

39:04.043 --> 39:06.173
I want usto be happy.

39:06.217 --> 39:09.565
This isn't about us anymore.

39:09.608 --> 39:11.608
You killed my father, Brian.

39:11.652 --> 39:14.043
I will not go down
with you for this.

39:14.086 --> 39:15.913
Oh, I'm afraid you are.

39:15.956 --> 39:17.956
Put your hands
behind your back.

39:19.391 --> 39:21.608
She's as guilty
as I am.He's lying.

39:21.652 --> 39:24.304
No, he-he forced me to do this.

39:24.347 --> 39:26.347
Somehow, I doubt that.

39:27.130 --> 39:29.000
That's a
nice girl.

39:29.043 --> 39:32.347
30 years, take her home
to meet the folks.

39:34.347 --> 39:37.086
Amber used me,
just like she used him.

39:37.130 --> 39:39.347
Mm-hmm.
and I never
saw it coming.

39:39.391 --> 39:41.869
I thought she was
another broken teenager

39:41.913 --> 39:44.869
caught up in
an ugly divorce.Doc...

39:44.913 --> 39:47.217
you look for
the good in people.

39:47.260 --> 39:50.869
There... there's
not much to find.

39:55.782 --> 39:57.913
Hey, Ziva and I
are going for drinks.

39:57.956 --> 39:59.260
You want to come?

39:59.304 --> 40:00.521
Only if you're buying.

40:00.565 --> 40:02.391
Agent DiNozzo.

40:02.434 --> 40:04.347
Fred Seymour
from Accounting!

40:04.391 --> 40:05.913
Actually, good news.

40:05.956 --> 40:08.913
We traced the problem back
to a clerical error,

40:08.956 --> 40:11.130
which resulted in overpayments
to you, Agent McGee.

40:11.173 --> 40:13.565
Oh. Oh.. [laughs]

40:13.608 --> 40:15.347
Now the bad news.
Thanks to your request

40:15.391 --> 40:18.260
that we review your file,
uh, we discovered

40:18.304 --> 40:20.391
that we've been short
on your FICA withholdings

40:20.434 --> 40:22.347
for the previous five years.

40:22.391 --> 40:27.043
What?So you owe us $2,997.33.

40:27.086 --> 40:28.913
Payable immediately.

40:28.956 --> 40:30.608
Enjoy your night.

40:30.652 --> 40:32.739
What?!

40:32.782 --> 40:36.043
We'll be at the bar
if you want to drown
your sorrows.

40:36.086 --> 40:38.043
What the...?

40:38.086 --> 40:40.260
What?

40:41.652 --> 40:44.086
[phone ringing]

40:47.217 --> 40:49.173
Yeah. Gibbs.

40:49.217 --> 40:51.391
Hi. What are you doing?

40:54.304 --> 40:56.260
Well... I'm sleeping.

40:56.304 --> 40:58.782
It's 4:00 in the morning.
What are you doing?

40:58.826 --> 41:00.826
Trying out my new phone.

41:00.869 --> 41:02.260
My other one disappeared.

41:02.304 --> 41:03.652
Yeah? That what happened, huh?

41:03.695 --> 41:04.869
Sorry.

41:04.913 --> 41:07.391
I don't get much sleep.

41:07.434 --> 41:09.391
I've got a lot on my mind.

41:10.956 --> 41:12.913
Whose head you messing
with tonight, Doc?

41:12.956 --> 41:14.000
[Ryan chuckles]

41:14.043 --> 41:16.000
Probably my own.

41:16.043 --> 41:17.652
I shouldn't have called.

41:18.695 --> 41:20.565
How can I help?

41:20.608 --> 41:24.043
I just wanted to...

41:24.086 --> 41:27.043
thank you for...

41:27.086 --> 41:29.217
figuring out
what happened to Robert.

41:31.608 --> 41:33.086
Doing my job.

41:33.130 --> 41:35.086
I think you
already knew, though.

41:36.695 --> 41:38.652
You make people
feel safe, Gibbs.

41:38.695 --> 41:40.695
It's a gift.

41:42.086 --> 41:44.260
Well, people need answers.

41:45.304 --> 41:47.130
I need breakfast.

41:48.956 --> 41:51.304
Okay.

41:51.347 --> 41:52.913
When?

41:52.956 --> 41:53.956
How about now?

41:56.260 --> 41:58.304
Well, I-I know a little...

41:58.347 --> 42:00.913
diner that's open 24 hours.

42:01.956 --> 42:03.739
Perfect.

42:07.086 --> 42:09.565
Are you asking me
on a date, Ryan?

42:12.043 --> 42:15.043
It's the middle of the night,
Agent Gibbs.

42:16.217 --> 42:18.217
You tell me.
