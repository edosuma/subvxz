WEBVTT

00:00.433 --> 00:15.382
We go further, so you can.
>> "60 MINUTES" HAS BEEN LOOKING
INTO AN ALARMING AMOUNT OF
MILITARY CASUALTIES-- NOT IN

00:15.448 --> 00:27.260
COMBAT, BUT IN TRAINING THAT
INVOLVE ARMORED VEHICLES.
WHAT'S BEING DONE ABOUT IT?
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

00:27.327 --> 00:35.001
WE FOUND THERE ARE SOLUTIONS,
BUT AN IMPORTANT ONE IS STUCK
BETWEEN THE PENTAGON AND
CONGRESS.

00:35.068 --> 00:41.708
OH, MY GOD!
(<i> TICKING</i> )
>> WE ARE HOLDING ADMITTED
PATIENTS IN THE EMERGENCY

00:41.775 --> 00:45.278
DEPARTMENT FOR DAYS UPON DAYS.
SO...
>> SO, THEY ARE JUST SITTING IN
THE E.R., BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A

00:45.345 --> 00:50.049
BED?
>> YES.
>> WE CAN PULL ALSO OUT BED 3,
MICHELLE, IF YOU NEED THAT BED.

00:50.116 --> 00:54.954
I FEEL LIKE EVERYBODY IS IN
SURVIVAL MODE.
AND NOT ONLY JUST US IN THE
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT-- I THINK

00:55.021 --> 00:58.425
THE WHOLE HOSPITAL IS.
>> WE HAD AN ENTIRE WAVE OF
NURSES AND PHYSICIANS WHO'D
WORKED FOR 25, 30, 35 YEARS--

00:58.491 --> 01:02.362
THEY SAID, "I-- TH-- I'M DONE.
I'M NOT GOING TO-- I'M NOT GOING
TO DO THIS ANYMORE."
AND THEY LEFT.

01:02.429 --> 01:03.396
(<i> TICKING</i> )

01:07.167 --> 01:11.738
>> I GREW UP A VERY, VERY MEAN
WOMAN BECAUSE OF ALL WHAT
HAPPENED TO ME.
>> YOU LEARNED THAT HERE, YOU

01:11.805 --> 01:19.879
THINK?
>> YEAH.
>> SHE IS NOT THE ONLY ONE.
MORE THAN 150,000 CHILDREN WERE

01:19.946 --> 01:27.353
SENT TO RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS,
WHICH CANADA'S FIRST PRIME
MINISTER SUPPORTED, TO, IN HIS
WORDS, "SEVER CHILDREN FROM THE

01:27.420 --> 01:32.459
TRIBE" AND "CIVILIZE" THEM.
>> MY NAME WAS NUMBER 65 FOR ALL
THOSE YEARS.
>> JUST A NUMBER.

01:32.525 --> 01:39.399
>> JUST A NUMBER, YEAH.
"65, PICK THAT UP, STUPID," OR,
"65, WHY'D YOU DO THAT, IDIOT?"
(<i> TICKING</i> )

01:42.235 --> 01:45.338
>> I'M LESLEY STAHL.
>> I'M BILL WHITAKER.
>> I'M ANDERSON COOPER.
>> I'M SHARYN ALFONSI.

01:45.405 --> 01:51.344
>> I'M JON WERTHEIM.
>> I'M SCOTT PELLEY.
THOSE STORIES AND MORE, TONIGHT,
ON "60 MINUTES."

01:51.411 --> 01:57.917
(<i> TICKING</i> )

01:59.252 --> 02:07.260
>> Lesley Stahl: LAST MONTH, TWO
MARINES WERE KILLED AND 17
INJURED-- NOT IN WAR, BUT IN
TRANSIT: THEIR TRUCK FLIPPED

02:07.327 --> 02:15.268
OVER ON A HIGHWAY OUTSIDE OF
CAMP LEJEUNE, NORTH CAROLINA.
AND IT'S NOT AS UNCOMMON AS
YOU'D THINK.

02:15.335 --> 02:23.243
WE FOUND THAT AS A PARENT OR
PARTNER OF SOMEONE IN THE
MILITARY, YOU'RE FAR LIKELIER TO
GET THAT DREADED "CALL" AND

02:23.309 --> 02:30.149
LEARN YOUR LOVED ONE WAS KILLED
IN AN ACCIDENT, RATHER THAN IN
COMBAT.
AND MANY-- FAR TOO MANY-- OF THE

02:30.216 --> 02:38.691
ACCIDENTS INVOLVE ARMORED
VEHICLES DURING TRAINING.
FIRST LIEUTENANT CONOR McDOWELL,
A PLATOON LEADER IN THE MARINES,

02:38.758 --> 02:47.033
WAS OUT ON A TRAINING MISSION IN
A LIGHT ARMORED VEHICLE LIKE
THIS, AT CAMP PENDELTON,
CALIFORNIA, IN MAY 2019, WHEN HE

02:47.100 --> 02:54.140
HIT AN UNMARKED DITCH COVERED IN
BRUSH.
DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENED.
>> Susan Flanigan: HE CALLED OUT

02:54.207 --> 03:03.316
TO HIS MEN, "ROLLOVER, ROLLOVER,
ROLLOVER;" PUSHED HIS GUNNER IN
THE TURRET NEXT TO HIM DOWN
UNDER THE ARMOR, BUT HE COULDN'T

03:03.383 --> 03:10.423
GET HIMSELF DOWN IN TIME, AND IT
CAREENED INTO THAT DITCH, ROLLED
OVER, AND CRUSHED HIM.
>> Stahl: CONOR WAS SUSAN

03:10.490 --> 03:17.230
FLANIGAN AND MICHAEL McDOWELL'S
ONLY CHILD.
>> Michael McDowell: AT FIRST, I
THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS WHAT

03:17.297 --> 03:23.469
HAPPENS WHEN YOU TRAIN LIKE YOU
MEAN TO FIGHT.
BUT WHEN WE WENT TO SAN DIEGO TO
BRING HIM BACK, I HAD A COUPLE

03:23.536 --> 03:35.315
OF IDLE MOMENTS IN THE HOTEL,
AND I GOOGLED "ROLLOVER" AND
"MILITARY."
AND I DISCOVERED THAT AT

03:35.381 --> 03:47.126
PENDLETON, A MONTH BEFORE, A
MARINE RAIDER HAD DIED IN A
ROLLOVER.
SO I GOOGLED FURTHER BACK, "THE

03:47.193 --> 03:56.603
ARMY," ET CETERA, AND SUDDENLY,
I SAW A WHOLE SERIES OF DEATHS
IN ROLLOVERS OF MILITARY
VEHICLES, ALL KINDS: HUMVEES,

03:56.669 --> 04:05.278
LIGHT-ARMORED VEHICLES, BRADLEY
FIGHTING VEHICLES.
AND THEN I REALIZED THIS IS NOT
A SINGLE INCIDENT.

04:05.345 --> 04:12.285
THIS IS A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM.
>> Stahl: DURING TRAINING?
>> McDowell: DURING TRAINING.
I CAN ACCEPT PEOPLE DYING IN

04:12.352 --> 04:22.095
COMBAT, BUT IF YOU'RE TRAINING
IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY AND YOU'RE
DYING NEEDLESSLY IN PREVENTABLE
ACCIDENTS, THIS IS A MASSIVE

04:22.161 --> 04:30.269
PROBLEM WHICH HAS TO BE FIXED.
>> Stahl: TO FIX IT, McDOWELL
KEPT DIGGING.
AND WHAT HE UNCOVERED, HE SAYS,

04:30.336 --> 04:36.275
WAS SO SERIOUS, AND YET SO
ROUTINELY NEGLECTED, THAT IT LED
TO THIS SCATHING REPORT BY THE
GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY

04:36.342 --> 04:48.287
OFFICE: THE G.A.O. FOUND CLOSE
TO 4,000 OF THESE ACCIDENTS IN
THE ARMY AND MARINE CORPS FROM
2010 TO 2019, RESULTING IN 123

04:48.354 --> 04:58.131
DEATHS-- NEARLY TWO-THIRDS OF
WHICH INVOLVED ROLLOVERS.
AND SHOCKINGLY, MOST OCCURRED IN
DAYLIGHT, ON REGULAR ROADS, EVEN

04:58.197 --> 05:03.936
IN PARKING LOTS.
>> McDowell: IT'S THE TRAGEDY OF
LOW EXPECTATIONS.
THAT IT'S EXPECTED PEOPLE WILL

05:04.003 --> 05:11.344
DIE IN TRAINING.
>> Stahl: ARE YOU SAYING THAT--
THAT THEY EXPECT THIS?
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

05:11.411 --> 05:15.615
>> McDowell: IT'S REGARDED AS,
THAT'S THE PRICE OF BEING A
SOLDIER, OR A MARINE.
>> Stahl: IN TRAINING?

05:15.682 --> 05:19.452
>> McDowell: YES.
>> Stahl: THEY EXPECT--
>> McDowell: "TRAINING IS
DANGEROUS.

05:19.519 --> 05:27.460
THESE THINGS HAPPEN."
>> Stahl: BUT THEY DON'T JUST
"HAPPEN."
THE G.A.O. CONCLUDED THERE WAS

05:27.527 --> 05:35.435
OFTEN "IMPROPER SUPERVISION,"
THAT DRIVERS WERE POORLY
TRAINED, AND VEHICLES,
INADEQUATELY INSPECTED.

05:35.501 --> 05:42.308
SOME ACCIDENTS INVOLVED MULTIPLE
FACTORS, AS WAS THE CASE WITH
CHRISTOPHER-BOBBY GNEM, A NAVY
SAILOR.

05:42.375 --> 05:51.350
(<i> YELLING</i> )
THESE ARE SCREAMS OF JOY FROM
BOBBY'S MOM, NANCY, WHEN HE
SURPRISED HER ONE CHRISTMAS.

05:51.417 --> 05:59.892
A YEAR AND A HALF LATER, IN THE
SUMMER OF 2020, HE AND 15
MARINES WERE TRAINING OFF CAMP
PENDLETON IN AMPHIBIOUS ASSAULT

05:59.959 --> 06:09.669
VEHICLES, OR A.A.V.s, LIKE
THESE: GIANT ARMORED VESSELS
MARINES USED ON BOTH LAND AND
SEA.

06:09.736 --> 06:15.508
HIS STEP-DAD, PETER VIENNA, SAYS
THE MARINES HAD NO BUSINESS
SENDING OUT THE A.A.V.s USED IN
HIS SON'S DRILL.

06:15.575 --> 06:23.282
>> Peter Vienna: THEY'RE 40
YEARS OLD, AND THEY WERE IN
TERRIBLE CONDITION.
AND INSTEAD OF ASKING FOR BETTER

06:23.349 --> 06:27.754
CONDITION A.A.V.s-- WHICH THERE
WERE, THERE WERE PLENTY OF THEM.
THEY HAD GOTTEN THESE, ALL OF
THEM THAT WERE IN POOR

06:27.820 --> 06:35.094
CONDITION.
>> Peter Ostrovsky: SO THEY'RE
SITTING IN A PARKING LOT ON CAMP
PENDLETON BAKING IN THE SUN.

06:35.161 --> 06:41.434
THEY'RE DETERIORATING.
>> Stahl: PETER OSTROVSKY'S SON,
JACK RYAN, WAS ALSO ON THAT
MISSION.

06:41.501 --> 06:48.441
>> Ostrovsky: A WEEK PRIOR TO
THE MISSION, WE WERE SPEAKING ON
THE TELEPHONE, AND HE MADE THE
COMMENT THAT "A.A.V.s SINK ALL

06:48.508 --> 06:53.246
THE TIME."
THEY'VE CALLED THEM, AND HE
CALLED IT, A "FLOATING COFFIN."
>> Stahl: DO YOU THINK HE WAS

06:53.312 --> 07:02.388
WORRIED?
>> Ostrovsky: OH, ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stahl: TWO A.A.V.s BROKE DOWN
AND THEIR SONS' DESIGNATED

07:02.455 --> 07:08.928
VEHICLE SPRANG AN ENGINE LEAK.
AND YET, THE MISSION WAS NOT
ABORTED.
WHAT WAS THE DRIVE TO GO FORWARD

07:08.995 --> 07:15.601
WITH FAULTY EQUIPMENT?
>> Ostrovsky: THEY'RE TRYING TO
KEEP A SCHEDULE.
TO STAY ON TIME.

07:15.668 --> 07:23.576
>> Vienna: THE SAFETY OF OUR
SONS TOOK A SECOND PLACE TO
COMPLETING A TRAINING MISSION.
THIS ISN'T COMBAT.

07:23.643 --> 07:29.715
THIS ISN'T "GOT TO DO IT RIGHT
NOW."
THIS IS TRAINING.
THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN

07:29.782 --> 07:36.055
ALL-STOP AT MANY POINTS.
>> Stahl: BUT 16 YOUNG MEN
CROWDED INTO THE A.A.V., AS SEEN
IN THIS VIDEO THAT ONE OF THE

07:36.122 --> 07:47.500
MARINES SENT HIS DAD.
IT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY STARTED
TAKING ON WATER-- ANKLE LEVEL;
CALF LEVEL; SEAT LEVEL; AS ONE

07:47.567 --> 07:53.272
BY ONE, THE A.A.V.
SYSTEMS WERE FAILING.
>> Vienna: THE COMMUNICATION
SYSTEM WAS DOWN.

07:53.339 --> 07:58.678
THEY WERE IN THE DARK, USING
THEIR-- THE LIGHTS ON THEIR CELL
PHONES TO TRY TO SEE.
>> Stahl: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

07:58.744 --> 08:02.815
THE LIGHTS DIDN'T WORK?
>> Vienna: THE SAFETY LIGHTING
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO FUNCTION,
DIDN'T FUNCTION.

08:02.882 --> 08:07.653
>> Stahl: WERE THERE LIFEBOATS?
>> Vienna: NO.
SO, THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE TWO
SAFETY BOATS IN THE WATER.

08:07.720 --> 08:15.661
THEY WENT WITH NONE.
>> Stahl: THIS IS THE A.A.V. AT
THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN, IN
UNDERWATER VIDEO WE OBTAINED

08:15.728 --> 08:23.469
THROUGH A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
REQUEST.
SEVEN MEN MADE IT OUT ALIVE.
NINE DID NOT.

08:23.536 --> 08:30.610
TURNS OUT, MOST HAD RECEIVED
LITTLE OR NO SAFETY TRAINING ON
HOW TO ESCAPE.
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

08:30.676 --> 08:36.616
>> Vienna: THERE'S SO MUCH OF IT
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
THEY WERE TAKING ON WATER FOR 45
MINUTES, YET THEY WERE STILL

08:36.682 --> 08:43.589
FOUND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN
WITH ALL THEIR-- THEIR GEAR
STILL ON, THEIR BODY ARMOR.
>> Stahl: AND THAT-- THEY SHOULD

08:43.656 --> 08:47.660
NOT HAVE-- THAT SHOULD HAVE COME
OFF?
>> Vienna: THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO.

08:47.727 --> 08:52.098
THEY WERE ALL LOOKING AT EACH
OTHER, LIKE, "WHAT DOES THIS
MEAN, WHAT DO WE DO?"
>> Stahl: YOU KNOW THE MARINE

08:52.164 --> 08:59.639
CORPS DID ITS OWN INVESTIGATION,
AND THE MARINE CORPS CONCLUDED
THAT THIS-- AND I'M GOING TO USE
THE DIRECT QUOTE-- WAS

08:59.705 --> 09:06.679
"PREVENTABLE."
>> Ostrovsky: THE TOP-DOWN
INCOMPETENCE, THE LACK OF
READINESS-- REALLY, THE LACK OF

09:06.746 --> 09:12.685
DUTY OF CARE FOR OUR SONS-- IT
WAS SHOCKING.
>> Stahl: CAN YOU SUE THE
MILITARY, OR THE COMMANDERS FOR

09:12.752 --> 09:19.725
WHAT HAPPENED?
>> Vienna: THERE'S THE FERES
DOCTRINE-- MAKES THAT
IMPOSSIBLE.

09:19.792 --> 09:26.399
>> Stahl: THE FERES DOCTRINE
PREVENTS ANYONE FROM SUING THE
MILITARY FOR ANYTHING THAT
HAPPENS TO SERVICE-MEMBERS ON

09:26.465 --> 09:33.973
THE JOB, NO MATTER HOW
EGREGIOUS.
>> Nancy Gnem: THE BIGGEST THING
FOR ME IS, THESE BOYS WERE NOT

09:34.040 --> 09:42.348
PROTECTED.
I HAVE THIS VISION IN MY HEAD,
NIGHTMARES, OF THE A.A.V. GOING
DOWN.

09:42.415 --> 09:48.688
WHAT WAS HIS LAST WORD?
>> Stahl: THIS WAS ONE OF THE
WORST TRAINING ACCIDENTS IN
MARINE CORPS HISTORY.

09:48.754 --> 09:59.699
BUT ACCIDENTS KEEP COMING, AND
THE G.A.O. STATES, LESS SERIOUS
ONES ARE LIKELY UNDER-REPORTED.
CHRISTIAN AVILA TAVERAS, AN ARMY

09:59.765 --> 10:07.707
COMBAT MEDIC, WAS ON A TRAINING
DRILL IN 2018 WHEN ONE VEHICLE
BROKE DOWN, SO HIS VEHICLE HAD
TO TOW IT.

10:07.773 --> 10:14.947
>> Christian Avila Taveras: THIS
IS AROUND 1:30 A.M., MAYBE.
IT'S DARK, IT'S RAINING, IT'S
MUDDY.

10:15.014 --> 10:21.187
THE VEHICLE THAT WE WERE TOWING
JUST SLID AND HIT US, AND SO, WE
JUST ROLLED OVER.
AND I WAS EXPELLED FROM THE

10:21.253 --> 10:26.258
VEHICLE, AND THEN THE VEHICLE
JUST LANDED ON TOP OF ME,
PINNING ME DOWN FROM THE WAIST
DOWN.

10:26.325 --> 10:30.696
>> Stahl: SO, THIS GIANT,
MONSTER VEHICLE ROLLS OVER ON
TOP OF YOU?
>> Avila Taveras: YES.

10:30.763 --> 10:39.705
ON TOP OF ME.
>> Stahl: HIS LEFT LEG HAD TO BE
AMPUTATED ABOVE THE KNEE.
THE RIGHT LEG WAS SO BADLY

10:39.772 --> 10:43.242
DAMAGED, HE SPENT THE NEXT TWO
YEARS IN REHAB, LEARNING HOW TO
WALK AGAIN.
>> YOU'RE KILLING IT, BRO,

10:43.309 --> 10:51.717
YOU'RE KILLING IT!
>> Stahl: AND WE LEARNED THERE
WAS ANOTHER ROLLOVER DURING
TRAINING AT THAT SAME PLACE THAT

10:51.784 --> 11:00.326
SAME DAY AS AVILA TAVERAS'S.
THE ARMY TOLD US THERE WERE
FEWER VEHICLE DEATHS LAST YEAR,
SAYING MOST ARE CAUSED BY HUMAN

11:00.393 --> 11:11.771
ERROR AND INEXPERIENCE; NEARLY
ONE IN FIVE ENLISTEES JOIN THE
ARMY WITH NO DRIVER'S LICENSE.
THE PENTAGON AND MARINES

11:11.837 --> 11:18.844
DECLINED OUR INTERVIEW REQUESTS,
THOUGH THE NEW DEFENSE BUDGET
MANDATES SEVERAL NEW SAFETY
PROVISIONS, AND A.A.V.s WILL NO

11:18.911 --> 11:27.787
LONGER BE USED IN WATER DRILLS.
BUT, THERE ARE MORE STEPS THE
MILITARY COULD TAKE, THAT THEY
HAVEN'T, INVOLVING RELATIVELY

11:27.853 --> 11:39.799
INEXPENSIVE UPGRADES TO THE
VEHICLE INVOLVED IN MOST
ACCIDENTS: THE HUMVEE.
THIS TEST FOOTAGE BY IMMI, A

11:39.865 --> 11:50.009
SAFETY SYSTEM SUPPLIER, SHOWS
WHAT CAN HAPPEN INSIDE A HUMVEE
IN A ROLLOVER.
BUT, WATCH.

11:50.076 --> 11:54.747
DRIVERS COULD HAVE A BETTER
CHANCE WHEN HUMVEES ARE
RETROFITTED WITH IMMI'S
RESTRAINTS AND AIRBAGS.

11:54.814 --> 12:03.489
ONE REASON THERE ARE SO MANY
HUMVEE ACCIDENTS IS NUMBERS:
OVER 100,000 ARE USED BY THE
ARMY ALONE.

12:03.556 --> 12:11.864
ANOTHER CAUSE IS ENGINEERING:
THEIR HIGH CENTER OF GRAVITY
MAKES THEM PRONE TO FLIP OVER.
AND, BECAUSE HUMVEES WERE EASY

12:11.931 --> 12:18.804
TARGETS FOR I.E.D.s IN IRAQ AND
AFGHANISTAN, THE MILITARY ADDED
EXTRA ARMOR THAT MADE THEM EVEN
LESS STABLE.

12:18.871 --> 12:27.847
OKAY.
WE WERE INVITED BY RICARDO
DEFENSE, A SMALL MILITARY
CONTRACTOR, TO SUIT UP FOR A

12:27.913 --> 12:33.119
DEMO OF HOW UNSTABLE THESE
VEHICLES CAN BE WHILE MAKING
TURNS.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

12:33.185 --> 12:39.859
WE WERE GOING LESS THAN 30 MILES
AN HOUR.
THE TWO YELLOW BARS WERE THERE
TO PREVENT US FROM ACTUALLY

12:39.925 --> 12:43.896
TIPPING OVER.
OH, GOD.
OH.
OH.

12:43.963 --> 12:47.867
OH.
STUART.
STUART.
OH, MY GOD.

12:47.933 --> 12:54.807
OH.
MOST HUMVEES DO NOT HAVE
ANTI-LOCK BRAKES OR ELECTRONIC
STABILITY CONTROL THAT PREVENT

12:54.874 --> 13:03.149
ROLLOVERS.
BUT, EIGHT YEARS AGO, RICARDO
DEVELOPED THEM FOR THE HUMVEE.
RICARDO'S PRESIDENT, CHET

13:03.215 --> 13:06.886
GRYSZAN:
>> Chet Gryszan: LET'S DO THE
SAME THING WITH THE SYSTEM ON,
PLEASE?

13:06.952 --> 13:12.892
>> Stahl: OH, HERE IT COMES.
OH.
WITH THE SYSTEM ON?
ALL WHEELS REMAINED FIRMLY ON

13:12.958 --> 13:19.932
THE GROUND.
GOODNESS GRACIOUS.
THE SYSTEM WORKS SO WELL, IT'S
NOW MANDATORY IN ALL NEW

13:19.999 --> 13:27.907
HUMVEES.
BUT, WHAT ABOUT HUMVEES ALREADY
IN USE?
WELL, RICARDO CAME UP WITH A

13:27.973 --> 13:39.518
SAFETY KIT THAT COULD BE
INSTALLED FOR ABOUT $16,000 PER
VEHICLE, IN ABOUT 54,000 OF THE
OLDER HUMVEES.

13:39.585 --> 13:46.091
YOU COULD MAKE TEN OR MORE OLD
VEHICLES SAFER, FOR THE PRICE OF
ONE NEW VEHICLE.
AND YET, THE DEPARTMENT OF

13:46.158 --> 13:54.900
DEFENSE IS ASKING FOR A LOT OF
MONEY FOR NEW HUMVEES-- BUT ONLY
A FRACTION OF WHAT'S NEEDED TO
RETROFIT OLD ONES.

13:54.967 --> 13:59.905
>> Gryszan: IF THE BUDGET WERE
TO BE APPROVED TODAY, AS THE
NUMBERS STAND, WE WOULD HAVE
ENOUGH FUNDING FOR ABOUT 545

13:59.972 --> 14:06.946
VEHICLES.
>> Stahl: 545 VEHICLES, OUT OF
54,000?
THAT'S IT?

14:07.012 --> 14:12.952
>> Gryszan: THAT'S IT, YEAH.
SOTHAT'S ABOUT 1% OF THE FLEET.
AT THAT RATE, IT'LL TAKE 100
YEARS TO GET THE FLEET FIT.

14:13.018 --> 14:23.929
>> Stahl: A RECENT LETTER TO THE
PENTAGON FROM SEVERAL
CONGRESSMEN ENDORSES YOUR KIT.
THEY CALCULATED THAT THE

14:23.996 --> 14:29.768
DIFFERENCE IN COST BETWEEN
PUTTING YOUR KIT ON AND BUILDING
A NEW VEHICLE IS ABOUT $13
BILLION.

14:29.835 --> 14:35.975
IT SOUNDS LIKE A NO-BRAINER.
>> Gryszan: YEAH.
WHY WOULDN'T YOU DO IT?
>> Stahl: CHAIR OF THE ARMED

14:36.041 --> 14:43.048
SERVICES SUBCOMMITTEE ON
READINESS, CONGRESSMAN JOHN
GARAMENDI, TOLD US THAT CONGRESS
AND THE PENTAGON'S PREFERENCE

14:43.115 --> 14:51.991
FOR NEW OVER UPGRADES IS "OFTEN
PREDICATED ON KEEPING DEFENSE
CONTRACTORS FED."
HAVE YOU MADE ANY MOVE TO SAY,

14:52.057 --> 14:58.831
"NOBODY SHOULD BE IN A HUMVEE
THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANTI-LOCK
BRAKES"?
>> McDowell: WE HAVE TRIED, AND

14:58.897 --> 15:04.136
I HAVE LOBBIED.
WE WANT TO INCREASE SAFETY IN
TRAINING-- BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE
DYING NEEDLESSLY IN PREVENTABLE

15:04.203 --> 15:11.543
ACCIDENTS.
IT WON'T COST THAT MUCH.
BUT IT'S GOT TO BE DONE.
AND THAT'S FOR THE AMERICAN

15:11.610 --> 15:21.220
PEOPLE TO PRESS THEIR MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS.
(<i> TICKING</i>

15:22.488 --> 15:30.262
>> Sharyn Alfonsi: IN MUCH OF
THE COUNTRY, THE NUMBER OF COVID
CASES IS FALLING.
THE OMICRON VARIANT MAY RESULT

15:30.329 --> 15:36.935
IN LESS SEVERE ILLNESS, BUT
INSIDE MANY OF THE COUNTRY'S
HOSPITALS, THE WORK IS MORE
DEMANDING THAN EVER.

15:37.002 --> 15:42.941
THAT'S LARGELY BECAUSE--
ACCORDING TO THE U.S. BUREAU OF
LABOR STATISTICS-- NEARLY
400,000 HEALTH CARE WORKERS HAVE

15:43.008 --> 15:50.449
LEFT SINCE THE START OF THE
PANDEMIC.
LAST MONTH, HOSPITALS IN 18
STATES REPORTED CRITICAL STAFF

15:50.516 --> 15:57.289
SHORTAGES, ICLUDING KENTUCKY.
SO, TWO WEEKS AGO, WE WENT TO
LOUISVILLE, A PLACE WHERE THE
VACCINATION AND INFECTION RATE

15:57.356 --> 16:02.494
HAS PRETTY MUCH MIRRORED THE
NATIONAL AVERAGE.
WE SAW E.R.s THAT WERE SHORT-
HANDED, AND NURSES AND DOCTORS

16:02.561 --> 16:09.101
WHO WERE EXHAUSTED.
AFTER TWO YEARS OF SOLDIERING
THROUGH COVID, THEY TOLD US THE
PANDEMIC HAD PUSHED THEM AND

16:09.168 --> 16:17.609
THEIR HOSPITAL CLOSE TO A
BREAKING POINT.
(<i> AMBULANCE</i> )
WHEN WE ARRIVED IN LOUISVILLE,

16:17.676 --> 16:22.481
AMBULANCES WERE RUSHING TO
HOSPITALS, ONLY TO WAIT ALMOST
AN HOUR TO DROP OFF PATIENTS--
BECAUSE EMERGENCY ROOMS WERE

16:22.548 --> 16:30.489
FULL.
THE HECTIC PACE OF TREATING
CARDIAC CASES AND ACCIDENT
VICTIMS WAS PUSHED TO NEW LEVELS

16:30.556 --> 16:36.261
BY ANOTHER WAVE OF COVID
PATIENTS NEEDING TREATMENT.
HOW QUICKLY DOES IT GO FROM BUSY
TO INSANE?

16:36.328 --> 16:40.999
>> Alyssa Parra: A MATTER OF
MINUTES.
WE CAN HAVE, YOU KNOW, NO
PATIENTS SIGNING INTO TRIAGE,

16:41.066 --> 16:46.438
AND THEN LOOK OUT THERE AND
THERE IS TEN.
>> Alfonsi: ALYSSA PARRA IS A
SUPERVISING NURSE IN THE

16:46.505 --> 16:51.176
EMERGENCY ROOM AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF LOUISVILLE HOSPITAL, ONE OF
THE LARGEST IN THE REGION.
>> Parra: THE GOAL IS TO GET HIS

16:51.243 --> 16:57.116
BLOOD PRESSURE UNDER 160.
>> Alfonsi: PARRA WAS ONE OF
FIVE EMPLOYEES "60 MINUTES"
FOLLOWED TO SEE HOW STAFF

16:57.182 --> 17:02.554
SHORTAGES WERE IMPACTING
HOSPITALS.
WE AGREED NOT TO IDENTIFY
PATIENTS, AND TO STAY OUT OF THE

17:02.621 --> 17:09.862
WAY.
IT WASN'T EASY, BECAUSE PATIENTS
WERE PARKED ANYWHERE THERE WAS
SPACE.

17:09.928 --> 17:14.566
85% OF THOSE HOSPITALIZED FOR
COVID IN KENTUCKY ARE NOT FULLY
VACCINATED.
>> Parra: WE ARE HOLDING

17:14.633 --> 17:18.670
ADMITTED PATIENTS IN THE
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR DAYS
UPON DAYS, SO...
>> Alfonsi: SO, THEY ARE JUST

17:18.737 --> 17:22.908
SITTING IN THE E.R., BECAUSE
THERE'S NOT A BED?
>> Parra: YES.
WE CAN PULL ALSO OUT BED 3,

17:22.975 --> 17:28.814
MICHELLE, IF YOU NEED THAT BED.
I FEEL LIKE EVERYBODY IS IN
SURVIVAL MODE.
AND NOT ONLY JUST US IN THE

17:28.881 --> 17:32.151
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT; I THINK
THE WHOLE HOSPITAL IS.
>> Alfonsi: WHAT DOES THAT LOOK
LIKE, WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO

17:32.217 --> 17:38.624
SURVIVE?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
>> Parra: HOW CAN WE TAKE CARE
OF PATIENTS EFFECTIVELY EVERY

17:38.690 --> 17:43.562
SINGLE DAY WITH THE STAFF THAT
WE HAVE?
>> Alfonsi: PARRA TOLD US HER
E.R. HAD FEWER NURSES THAN AT

17:43.629 --> 17:53.472
ANY POINT DURING THE PANDEMIC.
USUALLY, SHE'LL HAVE ABOUT A
DOZEN NURSES ON A SHIFT, BUT ON
THE DAY WE WERE WITH HER, SHE

17:53.539 --> 17:57.876
HAD JUST NINE OTHER NURSES TO
TREAT 71 PATIENTS IN THE E.R.,
WITH 16 MORE IN THE WAITING
ROOM.

17:57.943 --> 18:04.149
HAVE YOU HAD NURSES QUIT, THAT
WORK FOR YOU?
>> Parra: YES.
>> Alfonsi: TELL ME ABOUT THAT.

18:04.216 --> 18:09.855
>> Parra: YOU KNOW, SOME OF THEM
HAVE GOT TO A POINT, YOU KNOW,
WHERE THEY HAVE STEPPED AWAY.
AND, YOU KNOW, THEY'VE, YOU

18:09.922 --> 18:14.626
KNOW, MOVED ON AND SAID, YOU
KNOW, "I-- I NEED A BREAK FROM
THIS; I-- YOU KNOW, MENTALLY, I
JUST NEED A BREAK."

18:14.693 --> 18:19.832
WE JUST KEEP PUTTING ONE FOOT IN
FRONT OF THE OTHER AND, YOU
KNOW, TRYING TO TAKE IT DAY BY
DAY, AND I JUST TRY TO BRING

18:19.898 --> 18:24.837
POSITIVE ENERGY EVERY DAY.
>> Alfonsi: HOW HARD IS THAT
RIGHT NOW?
>> Parra: DIFFICULT.

18:24.903 --> 18:31.643
AND IT'S-- IT'S GETTING MORE
DIFFICULT EACH DAY.
>> Alfonsi: THE CONTAGIOUSNESS
OF THE OMICRON VARIANT HAS

18:31.710 --> 18:38.684
STRETCHED THE STAFF FURTHER.
LAST MONTH, 450 EMPLOYEES CALLED
IN SICK ON THE SAME DAY.
>> Dr. Jason Smith: I'VE GOT A

18:38.750 --> 18:44.456
MEETING WITH THEM.
>> Alfonsi: DR. JASON SMITH IS
TRYING TO FILL THE HOLES.
HE'S THE HOSPITAL'S CHIEF

18:44.523 --> 18:49.628
MEDICAL OFFICER, AND A TRAUMA
SURGEON.
>> Smith: WE HAD AN ENTIRE WAVE
OF NURSES AND PHYSICIANS WHO'D

18:49.695 --> 18:54.566
WORKED FOR 25, 30, 35 YEARS,
THEY SAID, "I-- TH-- I'M DONE.
I'M NOT GOING TO-- I'M NOT GOING
TO DO THIS ANYMORE."

18:54.633 --> 18:58.303
AND THEY LEFT.
>> Alfonsi: SOMEBODY QUITS, IT'S
NOT LIKE REPLACING A FRY COOK.
>> Smith: AND THEREIN LIES THE

18:58.370 --> 19:04.009
ISSUE, YOU KNOW?
IF YOU THINK ABOUT A NURSE?
ON AVERAGE, IT TAKES FOUR TO
FIVE YEARS TO TRAIN A NURSE.

19:04.076 --> 19:13.485
IT CAN TAKE EIGHT TO 12 YEARS TO
TRAIN A PHYSICIAN OR A SURGEON.
SO, IF YOU TURNED ON THE TAP
TODAY AND SAID, "I'M GOING TO

19:13.552 --> 19:18.257
DOUBLE THE AMOUNT, SO THAT WE
HAVE ENOUGH," WE STILL WON'T
HAVE ENOUGH FOR FOUR OR FIVE
YEARS.

19:18.323 --> 19:21.927
>> Alfonsi: IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE
DESCRIBING A SYSTEM AT ITS
BREAKING POINT.
>> Smith: I THINK WE ARE.

19:21.994 --> 19:26.698
AND I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGEST
WORRY I HAVE.
ARE WE GOING TO HAVE A SYSTEM
THAT WE CAN'T SUPPORT AFTER THIS

19:26.765 --> 19:33.939
PANDEMIC IS OVER?
WHAT WE EXPECT WHEN WE COME TO
THE HOSPITAL IS, THERE'S GOING
TO BE A PHYSICIAN, AND THERE'S

19:34.006 --> 19:38.744
GOING TO BE A NURSE, AND THEY'RE
GOING TO TAKE CARE OF ME.
BUT IN THE FUTURE, THAT MAY NOT
LOOK THAT WAY.

19:38.810 --> 19:43.682
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RETHINK
HOW WE CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS IN
THE HOSPITAL, MOVING FORWARD.
>> Alfonsi: UP ON THE SEVENTH

19:43.749 --> 19:50.155
FLOOR, WE MET AMANDA SWINNEY IN
THE I.C.U.
AS A RESPIRATORY THERAPIST, HER
JOB IS TO HELP PEOPLE BREATHE.

19:50.222 --> 19:54.693
>> Amanda Swinney: I'M GOING TO
TAKE A LISTEN TO YOUR LUNGS,
OKAY?
GIVE YOU A BREATHING TREATMENT.

19:54.760 --> 20:01.700
>> Alfonsi: BUT OVER THE LAST
TWO YEARS, SHE SAYS SHE'S BARELY
HAD A CHANCE TO BREATHE HERSELF.
ON THIS DAY, SHE WAS DARTING

20:01.767 --> 20:09.841
AMONG 40 PATIENTS, ALMOST DOUBLE
HER NORMAL WORKLOAD.
WHEN YOU HAVE A COVID PATIENT
WHO COMES IN, NOT VACCINATED,

20:09.908 --> 20:18.717
ARE YOU THINKING NOW, LIKE, "IT
DIDN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY"?
>> Swinney: I DO GET A SENSE OF,
"WOW-- HAD YOU CHOSEN A

20:18.784 --> 20:25.490
DIFFERENT ROUTE, THEN WE
WOULDN'T BE WHERE WE ARE NOW."
IT'S JUST FRUSTRATING.
IT'S FRUSTRATING WHEN THERE'S

20:25.557 --> 20:31.697
SOMETHING OUT THERE THAT CAN
KEEP YOU FROM DYING-- IT CAN
LOWER YOUR ODDS OF BEING
HOSPITALIZED, AND HAVING SEVERE

20:31.763 --> 20:37.703
DISEASE.
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY MORE
PEOPLE DON'T.
>> Alfonsi: SWINNEY TOLD US THAT

20:37.769 --> 20:46.511
SOMETIMES SHE FEELS NUMB.
>> Swinney: THERE'S, LIKE, THIS
THING CALLED COMPASSION FATIGUE,
WHERE, YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE I

20:46.578 --> 20:54.486
GAVE SO MUCH THOSE FIRST, LIKE,
NINE MONTHS, AND GOT SO CLOSE TO
SO MANY PATIENTS THAT WE LOST,
THAT NOW I ALMOST CAN'T DO THAT.

20:54.553 --> 20:58.690
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH LOSS, I
GUESS.
>> Alfonsi: SOME OF THE NURSES
HAVE DESCRIBED IT LIKE A WAR

20:58.757 --> 21:01.927
ZONE.
BUT IN A WAR ZONE, RIGHT, THEY--
THEY CHANGE OUT THE FRONT LINE
EVERY SO OFTEN.

21:01.994 --> 21:05.897
>> Swinney: RIGHT.
RIGHT.
WE CAN'T-- WE CAN'T GET AWAY
FROM IT.

21:05.964 --> 21:12.471
WE CAN'T WORK FROM HOME.
WE CAN'T DO VIRTUAL.
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO SHOW UP.
AND IT'S JUST-- IT JUST KEEPS

21:12.537 --> 21:16.608
COMING.
IT JUST KEEPS COMING.
>> Alfonsi: IS THIS THE NEW
REALITY?

21:16.675 --> 21:22.781
>> Swinney: I DON'T KNOW.
I'M NOT SURE.
I DON'T KNOW THAT I COULD, IN
ANOTHER YEAR, KEEP UP THIS PACE.

21:22.848 --> 21:28.920
>> Alfonsi: HOSPITALS IN
LOUISVILLE HAVE BEEN WORKING
TOGETHER SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO
TURN AWAY PATIENTS, BUT STAFF

21:28.987 --> 21:35.293
SHORTAGES IN OTHER PARTS OF THE
COUNTRY HAVE FORCED HEALTH
SYSTEMS TO CANCEL ELECTIVE
SURGERIES, TEMPORARILY CLOSE

21:35.360 --> 21:43.001
PARTS OF MATERNITY WARDS, OR
LEAVE HOSPITAL BEDS EMPTY.
NURSES ARE OFTEN THE BACKBONE OF
THOSE HOSPITALS.

21:43.068 --> 21:49.841
IN A SURVEY LAST FALL, THE
KENTUCKY NURSES ASSOCIATION
REPORTED ONE IN FOUR NURSES SAID
THEY WERE LIKELY TO QUIT THEIR

21:49.908 --> 21:58.750
JOB IN THE NEXT THREE MONTHS.
DELANOR MANSON IS THE C.E.O. OF
THE ASSOCIATION.
>> Delanor Manson: WHEN YOU

21:58.817 --> 22:05.424
THINK ABOUT NURSING AS BEING 53%
OF THE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE,
THOSE ARE LARGE NUMBERS.
YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT THERE WAS

22:05.490 --> 22:10.829
A NURSING SHORTAGE PRIOR TO THE
PANDEMIC.
THE PANDEMIC HAS RIPPED OFF THE
BANDAGE.

22:10.896 --> 22:18.070
THEY'RE OVERWORKED.
THEY HAVE TO DO THINGS THAT IT
DOESN'T TAKE A NURSE TO DO.
>> Alfonsi: LIKE WHAT?

22:18.136 --> 22:24.743
>> Manson: BATHS.
WALKING PATIENTS.
TURNING PATIENTS.
BUT SOMEONE ELSE COULD DO THAT.

22:24.810 --> 22:30.816
IT DOESN'T TAKE A DEGREE OR A
LICENSE TO DO THOSE THINGS.
>> Alfonsi: THAT WORK IS
IMPORTANT FOR PATIENT CARE, AND

22:30.882 --> 22:38.123
IS USUALLY HANDLED BY AIDES.
NOW THY'RE IN SHORT SUPPLY TOO.
SO, IN SOME HOSPITALS, NURSES
HAVE HAD TO MOP FLOORS OR EMPTY

22:38.190 --> 22:43.228
TRASH.
>> Julia Anderson: AS SOON AS
YOU TRANSFER A PATIENT, OR
DISCHARGE A PATIENT, IT'S NOT

22:43.295 --> 22:46.832
FIVE MINUTES LATER YOU'RE
GETTING ANOTHER PATIENT.
THAT'S A DRINK AND A POTTY
BREAK.

22:46.898 --> 22:50.769
YES, BED 4 IS GETTING
DISCHARGED.
ARE YOU READY TO GET OUT OF
HERE?

22:50.836 --> 22:55.807
>> Alfonsi: JULIA ANDERSON IS AN
I.C.U. NURSE.
SHE WAS JUST 19 WHEN SHE BEGAN
HER CAREER IN 2020.

22:55.874 --> 23:02.881
ANDERSON HAD GRADUATED HIGH
SCHOOL EARLY, ENROLLED IN A
FAST-TRACK TRAINING PROGRAM, AND
WAS QUICKLY ASSIGNED TO TREAT

23:02.948 --> 23:08.820
THE SICKEST COVID PATIENTS.
I IMAGINE THERE'S NOTHING THEY
CAN TEACH YOU IN NURSING SCHOOL
TO PREPARE YOU FOR THIS MOMENT.

23:08.887 --> 23:13.759
>> Anderson: NO.
NOT AT ALL.
I MEAN, THEY DIDN'T TEACH YOU
THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO ZIP UP

23:13.825 --> 23:18.897
YOUR FIRST BODY BAG.
I-- I STILL REMEMBER THE FIRST
PATIENT'S NAME.
THE FIRST ROOM.

23:18.964 --> 23:26.505
WHAT HAPPENED, AND EVERYTHING.
AND THAT WAS HARD.
>> Alfonsi: THE FREQUENCY OF
COVID DEATHS HERE HAS DECLINED,

23:26.571 --> 23:33.512
BUT THE STRESS HASN'T.
ANDERSON SAYS NURSES ARE
INCREASINGLY BEING CONFRONTED BY
ANGRY PATIENTS-- SOME OF THEM,

23:33.578 --> 23:38.950
ENRAGED BY THE LONG WAITS FOR
CARE.
>> Anderson: LAST WEEK, I HAD A
PATIENT PUT HER HANDS ON ME,

23:39.017 --> 23:44.156
AFTER CUSSING ME OUT FOR
PROBABLY TEN MINUTES.
PUT HER HANDS ON ME AND PUSHED
ME AS HARD AS SHE COULD.

23:44.222 --> 23:47.125
I'VE BEEN CALLED EVERY NAME
UNDER THE BOOK.
>> Alfonsi: YOU HAVE?
>> Anderson: OH MY GOODNESS,

23:47.192 --> 23:49.995
YES.
IN ONE EAR, OUT THE OTHER EAR.
YOU KNOW--
>> Alfonsi: REALLY?

23:50.061 --> 23:53.298
THAT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU?
>> Anderson: IT USED TO.
>> Alfonsi: YEH.
>> Anderson: IT USED TO BOTHER

23:53.365 --> 23:58.904
ME REALLY BAD.
I MEAN, I'VE-- I'VE CRIED BEFORE
AT SOME OF THE NAMES I'VE BEEN
CALLED, BY FAMILY MEMBERS, BY

23:58.970 --> 24:02.974
PATIENTS.
BUT NOW, I GUESS I'M IMMUNE TO
IT.
>> Alfonsi: DOES ANYBODY WHO'S

24:03.041 --> 24:09.748
NOT IN THAT ROOM, IN THAT
HOSPITAL, UNDERSTAND, TRULY?
>> Anderson: I TELL MY MOM ALL
THE TIME, "I WISH YOU WERE A FLY

24:09.815 --> 24:17.122
ON THE WALL FOR ONE SHIFT."
BUT UNTIL YOU CAN GET SOMEBODY
WHO GOES THROUGH IT WITH YOU AND
HAS A PATIENT PASS IN ONE ROOM,

24:17.189 --> 24:20.425
AND THEN THE NEXT PATIENT'S ON
THEIR CALL LIGHT, SAYING, "YOU
FORGOT TO BRING ME MY WATER.
YOU TOLD ME YOU WOULD 45 MINUTES

24:20.492 --> 24:26.965
AGO."
AND YOU PUT ON A FACE AND YOU
SAY, "YES, MA'AM, I'M SO SORRY.
I'LL BRING YOU THAT WATER,"

24:27.032 --> 24:33.805
KNOWING THAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO
CRY-- YOU ARE ABOUT TO LET IT
OUT, BUT YOU CAN'T.
>> Alfonsi: WE GOT A SENSE OF

24:33.872 --> 24:42.614
THAT WHEN WE MET KRYSTAL TOTTEN.
SHE WORKS WITH PATIENTS WHO NEED
ECMO, A MACHINE THAT OXYGENATES
BLOOD OUTSIDE THE BODY, AND IS

24:42.681 --> 24:49.254
USED WHEN LUNGS ARE TOO WEAK TO
DO THE JOB.
LAST SEPTEMBER, A FELLOW NURSE
AND FRIEND, BECKY FULKS, BECAME

24:49.321 --> 24:55.227
ONE OF HER PATIENTS, WHEN FULKS
BECAME SICK WITH COVID.
>> Krystal Totten: I REMEMBER
JUST, LIKE, YOU KNOW, JUST

24:55.293 --> 25:01.900
BREAKING DOWN, BECAUSE SEEING
SOMEBODY AT THEIR WORST POINT,
YOU KNOW, NOT KNOWING IF THEY'RE
GOING TO LIVE OR DIE IS, YOU

25:01.967 --> 25:07.038
KNOW, IS VERY-- IS VERY HARD.
>> Alfonsi: FULKS IS A HEART AND
LUNG NURSE.
SHE WAS VACCINATED, AND WORKING

25:07.105 --> 25:12.844
THROUGH THE PANDEMIC.
SHE WAS IN BAD SHAPE WHEN YOU
SAW HER?
>> Totten: OH, SHE-- YEAH.

25:12.911 --> 25:18.917
SO, FOR A PATIENT TO NEED TO GO
ON ECMO, IT'S A LAST-DITCH
EFFORT.
IT'S A MAXIMUM FORM OF LIFE

25:18.984 --> 25:26.024
SUPPORT.
>> Alfonsi: LAST MONTH, BECKY
FULKS BEGAN TO IMPROVE.
SHE WAS TAKEN OFF THE ECMO

25:26.091 --> 25:33.398
MACHINE, BUT STILL HAS A
TRACHEOSTOMY TUBE.
IT'S UNCLEAR IF THE 49-YEAR-OLD
MOTHER OF TWO WILL EVER GET BACK

25:33.465 --> 25:40.472
TO NURSING.
WHAT DOES BECKY'S STORY TELL US
ABOUT ALL THE NURSES?
>> Totten: IT'S WEIRD TO SAY,

25:40.538 --> 25:47.045
SHE'S ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES, WHO
HAVE FOUGHT THROUGH THIS.
YOU'RE PUTTING YOURSELF AND YOUR
FAMILY AT RISK, YOU KNOW, EVERY

25:47.112 --> 25:57.122
DAY, TO TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE.
EVEN PEOPLE WHO-- I'VE HAD
PEOPLE LOOK ME IN THE FACE AND
TELL ME IT'S NOT REAL, AND THAT

25:57.188 --> 26:02.093
THEY'RE PUTTING CHIPS IN YOUR
BODY.
>> Alfonsi: THAT HAS TO BE HARD,
AS A NURSE.

26:02.160 --> 26:05.497
>> Totten: IT'S-- IT'S REALLY
HARD.
>> Alfonsi: ESPECIALLY WHEN YOUR
FRIEND IS DOWN THE HALL.

26:05.563 --> 26:11.102
>> Totten: IT'S-- IT'S VERY
DFFICULT.
IT FEELS LIKE A SLAP IN THE
FACE.

26:11.169 --> 26:17.609
>> Smith: THIS IS OUR STORY, BUT
YOU COULD TAKE THIS STORY TO NEW
YORK, CHICAGO, L.A., PHOENIX,
YOU KNOW, ATLANTA.

26:17.676 --> 26:23.648
YOU WILL HEAR THIS STORY AT
PRETTY MUCH EVERY HOSPITAL,
EVERY HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ACROSS
THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW.

26:23.715 --> 26:30.889
>> Alfonsi: WE INVITED DR. JASON
SMITH'S COLLEAGUES FROM THE TWO
OTHER LARGE MEDICAL SYSTEMS IN
LOUISVILLE TO JOIN OUR

26:30.956 --> 26:37.028
CONVERSATION.
DR. STEVEN HESTER IS CHIEF
MEDICAL OFFICER WITH NORTON
HEALTHCARE, AND DR. CHUCK

26:37.095 --> 26:40.598
ANDERSON IS WITH BAPTIST HEALTH.
RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU'RE HIRING
AT LEAST 50 NURSES RIGHT NOW,
OPEN POSITIONS.

26:40.665 --> 26:43.802
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )
AT LEAST 50.
>> Voices: YEAH.
>> Dr. Chuck Anderson: IF-- IF

26:43.868 --> 26:46.438
THEY WALK IN TOMORROW, WE'LL
TAKE THEM.
>> Alfonsi: YOU'LL TAKE THEM.
100?

26:46.504 --> 26:50.075
>> Anderson: YES.
>> Smith: YEAH.
>> Alfonsi: 150?
150 NURSES YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?

26:50.141 --> 26:59.117
>> Voices: YEAH.
>> Anderson: PRE-PANDEMIC, I
THINK WE ALL HAD A BUFFER.
I THINK OUR BUFFER IS A FINE

26:59.184 --> 27:06.725
LINE RIGHT NOW, AND THAT'S
WHAT'S MAKING IT DIFFICULT.
>> Alfonsi: THE SUPPLY OF
NURSING SCHOOL GRADUATES IS ALSO

27:06.791 --> 27:11.262
FALLING SHORT, LEAVING HOSPITALS
WITHOUT ENOUGH REINFORCEMENTS.
>> OKAY, WELL, WE'RE GOING TO
LOOK AT YOUR BELLY.

27:11.329 --> 27:17.635
>> Alfonsi: ALTHOUGH
APPLICATIONS TO NURSING SCHOOLS
ARE UP, RECORD NUMBERS OF
PROSPECTIVE NURSES ARE BEING

27:17.702 --> 27:25.510
DENIED ADMISSION BECAUSE THERE
AREN'T ENOUGH INSTRUCTORS.
LAST YEAR, 1,700 QUALIFIED
APPLICANTS IN KENTUCKY WERE

27:25.577 --> 27:30.682
TURNED AWAY FROM NURSING SCHOOLS
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF TEACHERS.
>> Smith: THIS PANDEMIC WILL
END.

27:30.749 --> 27:35.487
ALL PANDEMICS END.
BUT IT'S THE CARRY-FORWARD FROM
WHAT WE'RE HAVING TO DO, AND THE
AMOUNT OF HUMAN CAPITAL THAT

27:35.553 --> 27:44.162
WE'RE BURNING THROUGH RIGHT NOW,
THAT ARE GOING TO IMPACT THE
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FOR THE NEXT
TWO, FIVE, TEN YEARS.

27:44.229 --> 27:51.169
>> Alfonsi: AND A WAVE OF 70
MILLION AGING BABY BOOMERS IS
ABOUT TO FLOOD AMERICAN
HEALTHCARE.

27:51.236 --> 27:56.141
DOCTORS, TECHNICIANS, AND AN
ESTIMATED 270,000 NEW REGISTERED
NURSES WILL BE NEEDED TO HELP
CARE FOR THEM, ACCORDING TO THE

27:56.207 --> 28:02.814
BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS.
WHY DO YOU THINK WE HAVEN'T BEEN
TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S NEXT?
>> Smith: WELL, IT'S A DIFFICULT

28:02.881 --> 28:07.619
CONVERSATION TO HAVE.
IT'S NOT RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR
FACE.
THIS IS, WHAT'S THE CHRONIC

28:07.685 --> 28:12.924
PROBLEM?
HOW AM I GOING TO MANAGE THE
CHRONIC PROBLEM?
AND IN HEALTHCARE, MANAGING

28:12.991 --> 28:19.130
CHRONIC PROBLEMS ARE OFTEN MUCH
MORE DIFFICULT THAN, YOU KNOW,
THE-- THE ACUTE PROBLEM.
WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW, IN A

28:19.197 --> 28:23.435
PANDEMIC, MAY BECOME AN EVERYDAY
OCCURRENCE, AND THAT'S NOT
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN SUSTAIN
FOR DECADES.

28:23.501 --> 28:26.304
(<i> TICKING</i> )

28:27.305 --> 28:35.513
>><i> INSIDE THE MATERNITY WARD.</i>
<i>HOW COVID IS AFFECTING PREGNANT</i>
<i>WOMEN, THEIR BABIES, AND THE</i>
<i>DOCTORS WHO TREAT THEM.</i>

28:35.580 --> 28:39.584
<i>AT 60minutes</i>

28:40.919 --> 28:51.996
(<i> TICKING</i> )
>> Anderson Cooper: LAST YEAR,
WHEN ARCHEOLOGISTS DETECTED WHAT
THEY BELIEVED TO BE 200 UNMARKED

28:52.063 --> 28:57.135
GRAVES AT AN OLD SCHOOL IN
CANADA, IT BROUGHT NEW ATTENTION
TO ONE OF THE MOST SHAMEFUL
CHAPTERS OF THAT NATION'S

28:57.202 --> 29:04.909
HISTORY.
STARTING IN THE 1880s, AND FOR
MUCH OF THE 20th CENTURY, MORE
THAN 150,000 CHILDREN FROM

29:04.976 --> 29:11.382
HUNDREDS OF INDIGENOUS
COMMUNITIES ACROSS CANADA WERE
FORCIBLY TAKEN FROM THEIR
PARENTS BY THE GOVERNMENT AND

29:11.449 --> 29:17.622
SENT TO WHAT WERE CALLED
RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS.
FUNDED BY THE STATE AND RUN BY
CHURCHES, THEY WERE DESIGNED TO

29:17.689 --> 29:24.629
ASSIMILATE AND CHRISTIANIZE
INDIGENOUS CHILDREN BY RIPPING
THEM FROM THEIR PARENTS, THEIR
CULTURE, AND THEIR COMMUNITY.

29:24.696 --> 29:32.904
THE CHILDREN WERE OFTEN REFERRED
TO AS SAVAGES AND FORBIDDEN FROM
SPEAKING THEIR LANGUAGES OR
PRACTICING THEIR TRADITIONS.

29:32.971 --> 29:40.912
MANY WERE PHYSICALLY AND
SEXUALLY ABUSED, AND THOUSANDS
OF CHILDREN NEVER MADE IT HOME.
THE LAST OF CANADA'S 139

29:40.979 --> 29:47.919
RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS FOR
INDIGENOUS CHILDREN CLOSED IN
1998.
MOST HAVE BEEN TORN DOWN.

29:47.986 --> 29:53.291
BUT THE MUSKOWEKWAN RESIDENTIAL
SCHOOL IN SASKATCHEWAN STILL
STANDS.
ITS WINDOWS BOARDED UP.

29:53.358 --> 30:00.398
ITS ROOMS GUTTED.
A REMINDER TO A NATION THAT
WOULD RATHER FORGET.
A THREE-STORY TOMBSTONE, FOR

30:00.465 --> 30:05.303
GENERATIONS OF CHILDREN WHO DIED
HERE.
>> Leona Wolf: SOMETIMES, I WISH
IT WOULD BE GONE, FOR ALL WHAT

30:05.370 --> 30:10.241
HAPPENED HERE.
>> Cooper: YOU WISH THIS HAD
BEEN TORN DOWN?
>> Wolf: YEAH.

30:10.308 --> 30:17.315
I COULD HEAR EVERYTHING IN HERE,
WHAT WAS DONE.
IT LINGERS.
>> Cooper: LEONA WOLF, WHO COMES

30:17.382 --> 30:23.922
FROM THE MUSKOWEKWAN RESERVE,
WAS FIVE YEARS OLD WHEN SHE SAYS
SHE WAS TAKEN FROM HER HOME IN
1960.

30:23.988 --> 30:32.230
SCHOOL OFFICIALS AND POLICE
WOULD OFTEN SHOW UP UNANNOUNCED
IN INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES AND
ROUND UP CHILDREN, SOME AS YOUNG

30:32.297 --> 30:36.901
AS THREE.
PARENTS COULD BE JAILED IF THEY
REFUSED TO HAND THEIR CHILDREN
OVER.

30:36.968 --> 30:43.041
WHEN KIDS ARRIVED AT THEIR
SCHOOLS, THEIR TRADITIONAL LONG
HAIR WAS SHAVED OFF.
IF THEY TRIED TO SPEAK THEIR

30:43.107 --> 30:48.913
LANGUAGE, THEY WERE OFTEN
PUNISHED.
>> Wolf: THEY PUT ME IN A LITTLE
DARK ROOM, LIKE THAT.

30:48.980 --> 30:56.921
AND THEY'D SHUT THE DOOR AND
THEN THEY'D TAKE OFF THE LIGHT.
ALL I HAD TO LOOK THROUGH WAS
THIS MUCH LIGHT, LIKE I WAS IN

30:56.988 --> 31:03.061
JAIL.
>> Cooper: SHE SAYS THE ABUSE
MANY KIDS AT MUSKOWEKWAN
SUFFERED FROM THE CATHOLIC

31:03.127 --> 31:10.668
PRIESTS AND NUNS WASN'T JUST
PHYSICAL.
>> Wolf: FATHER JOYAL WAS
FONDLING THE GIRLS HERE.

31:10.735 --> 31:14.739
>> Cooper: A PRIEST, FATHER
JOYAL, WAS FONDLING GIRLS IN
THIS ROOM?
>> Wolf: YEAH.

31:14.806 --> 31:17.976
THIS USED TO BE SICK BAY.
THEY USED TO HAVE A BED HERE.
>> Cooper: AND HE WOULD TAKE
GIRLS INTO THE BED?

31:18.042 --> 31:23.982
>> Wolf: YEAH.
MY COUSIN.
>> Cooper: HE TOOK YOUR COUSIN
IN HERE?

31:24.048 --> 31:31.756
HOW OLD WAS SHE?
>> Wolf: SHE WAS ONLY EIGHT.
I GREW UP A VERY, VERY MEAN
WOMAN, BECAUSE OF ALL WHAT

31:31.823 --> 31:35.760
HAPPENED TO ME.
>> Cooper: YOU LEARNED THAT
HERE, YOU THINK?
>> Wolf: YEAH.

31:35.827 --> 31:42.000
>> Cooper: SHE IS NOT THE ONLY
ONE.
MORE THAN 150,000 CHILDREN WERE
SENT TO RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS,

31:42.066 --> 31:51.843
WHICH CANADA'S FIRST PRIME
MINISTER SUPPORTED, TO, IN HIS
WORDS, "SEVER CHILDREN FROM THE
TRIBE" AND "CIVILIZE" THEM.

31:51.909 --> 31:59.984
FOR MUCH OF THE 20th CENTURY,
THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT
SUPPORTED THAT MISSION.
THIS REPORT AIRED IN 1955.

32:00.051 --> 32:05.056
>><i> THEY LEARN NOT ONLY GAMES AND</i>
<i>TRADITIONS, SUCH AS THE</i>
<i>CELEBRATION OF SAINT</i>
<i>VALENTINE'S DAY, BUT THE</i>

32:05.123 --> 32:11.829
<i>MASTERY OF WORDS.</i>
>> Cooper: THE IDEA FOR THE
SCHOOLS CAME IN PART FROM THE
UNITED STATES.

32:11.896 --> 32:17.468
IN 1879, THE CARLISLE INDIAN
INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL OPENED IN
PENNSYLVANIA, WHERE THIS PHOTO
WAS TAKEN OF NATIVE AMERICAN

32:17.535 --> 32:24.742
CHILDREN WHEN THEY FIRST
ARRIVED.
THIS IS THEM FOUR MONTHS LATER.
THE SCHOOL'S MOTTO WAS "KILL THE

32:24.809 --> 32:30.248
INDIAN, SAVE THE MAN."
>> Chief Wilton Littlechild:
CONSEQUENTLY, OURS WAS, "KILL
THE INDIAN IN THE CHILD."

32:30.315 --> 32:34.252
>> Cooper: "KILL THE INDIAN IN
THE CHILD."
>> Littlechild: MM-HMM.
>> Cooper: THAT WAS THE GUIDING

32:34.319 --> 32:40.325
PRINCIPLE HERE IN CANADA.
>> Littlechild: YEAH.
>> Cooper: CHIEF WILTON
LITTLECHILD, WHO IS CREE, WAS

32:40.391 --> 32:45.163
SIX YEARS OLD WHEN HE WAS TAKEN
TO THIS RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL IN
ALBERTA.
THEN, HE SAYS, HE WAS GIVEN A

32:45.229 --> 32:51.903
NEW NAME.
>> Littlechild: MY NAME WAS
NUMBER 65 FOR ALL THOSE YEARS.
>> Cooper: JUST A NUMBER.

32:51.969 --> 32:57.175
>> Littlechild: JUST A NUMBER,
YEAH.
"65, PICK THAT UP, STUPID," OR,
"65, WHY'D YOU DO THAT, IDIOT?"

32:57.241 --> 33:03.348
>> Cooper: WHAT DOES THAT FEEL
LIKE, AT SIX YEARS OLD, TO BE
CALLED A NUMBER?
>> Littlechild: WELL, I THINK

33:03.414 --> 33:09.120
THAT'S WHERE THE TRAUMA BEGINS.
NOT JUST THE PHYSICAL ABUSE--
PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE, SPIRITUAL
ABUSE.

33:09.187 --> 33:17.095
AND WORST OF ALL, SEXUAL ABUSE.
>> Cooper: YOU WERE SEXUALLY
ABUSED.
>> Littlechild: YES.

33:17.161 --> 33:25.169
I THINK THAT'S WHERE MY ANGER
BEGAN AS A YOUNG BOY.
>> Cooper: CHIEF LITTLECHILD
SAYS HE WAS ABLE TO TAKE SOME OF

33:25.236 --> 33:32.210
THAT ANGER OUT ON THE SCHOOL'S
HOCKEY RINK.
HE WON A SCHOLARSHIP TO
UNIVERSITY, AND GRADUATED,

33:32.276 --> 33:36.447
EVENTUALLY GOING ON TO A
DISTINGUISHED CAREER IN LAW.
BUT, HIS STORY IS THE EXCEPTION.
>> Littlechild: THEY DIDN'T KILL

33:36.514 --> 33:45.123
MY SPIRIT.
SO, I'M STILL CREE.
I'M STILL WHO I AM.
I'M NOT 65.

33:45.189 --> 33:53.097
MY NAME IS MAHIGAN PIMOTEYW.
SO, THEY DIDN'T KILL MY SPIRIT.
>> Cooper: IN 2008, AFTER
THOUSANDS OF SCHOOL SURVIVORS

33:53.164 --> 34:00.138
FILED LAWSUITS, THE CANADIAN
GOVERNMENT FORMALLY APOLOGIZED
FOR ITS POLICIES.
IT ALSO SET UP A $1.9 BILLION

34:00.204 --> 34:09.180
COMPENSATION FUND, AND
ESTABLISHED A TRUTH AND
RECONCILIATION COMMISSION THAT
CHIEF LITTLECHILD HELPED LEAD.

34:09.247 --> 34:17.188
FOR SIX YEARS, THE COMMISSION
HEARD TESTIMONY FROM SURVIVORS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
>> Helen Quewezance: AND SHE PUT

34:17.255 --> 34:24.195
ME UNDERWATER, SLAPPING ME AND
HITTING ME, SLAPPING ME AND
HITTING ME, AND PUNCHING ME AND
PUNCHING ME, AND HOLDING ME

34:24.262 --> 34:33.171
UNDER WATER, PULLING MY HAIR,
AND I THOUGHT, GOD, SHE'S GOING
TO KILL ME, I'M GOING TO DIE
FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.

34:33.237 --> 34:45.249
>> Ted Quewezance: WE, AS LITTLE
BOYS AND LITTLE GIRLS, WE LOST
OUR INNOCENCE.

34:48.252 --> 34:53.191
>> Cooper: IN 2015, THE
COMMISSION CONCLUDED WHAT
HAPPENED WAS "CULTURAL
GENOCIDE."

34:53.257 --> 35:00.198
IT IDENTIFIED MORE THAN 3,000
CHILDREN WHO DIED FROM DISEASE
DUE TO OVERCROWDING,
MALNUTRITION, AND POOR

35:00.264 --> 35:07.972
SANITATION, OR DIED AFTER BEING
ABUSED OR TRYING TO RUN AWAY.
A GOVERNMENT STUDY IN 1909 FOUND
THE DEATH RATE IN SOME SCHOOLS

35:08.039 --> 35:14.712
WAS AS HIGH AS 20 TIMES THE
NATIONAL AVERAGE.
MOST SCHOOLS HAD THEIR OWN
CEMETERIES, AND SOMETIMES, WHEN

35:14.779 --> 35:21.886
CHILDREN DIED, THEIR PARENTS
WERE NEVER INFORMED.
>> Littlechild: IT'S REALLY
TRAUMATIC FOR THOSE FAMILIES WHO

35:21.953 --> 35:28.125
DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO
THEIR CHILD OR RELATIVE IN THE
SCHOOLS.
>> Cooper: WHY WEREN'T KIDS WHO

35:28.192 --> 35:35.333
DIED AT THE SCHOOLS, WHY WEREN'T
THEY SENT HOME?
>> Littlechild: TO SAVE MONEY.
>> Cooper: LAST YEAR,

35:35.399 --> 35:41.405
ARCHEOLOGISTS DETECTED WHAT THEY
SAID COULD BE 200 UNMARKED
GRAVES AT THIS FORMER SCHOOL IN
KAMLOOPS, BRITISH COLUMBIA.

35:41.472 --> 35:48.346
WEEKS LATER, A FURTHER 751
UNMARKED GRAVES WERE DETECTED
ACROSS FROM THE FORMER MARIEVAL
RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL ON THE

35:48.412 --> 35:54.252
COWESSESS RESERVE IN
SASKATCHEWAN.
THERE WAS ONCE A CATHOLIC
CEMETERY HERE, BUT THE

35:54.318 --> 36:03.427
HEADSTONES WERE BULLDOZED IN THE
1960s BY A PRIEST, AFTER A
DISPUTE WITH A FORMER CHIEF.
AND WHAT WERE THESE LISTS FOR?

36:03.494 --> 36:09.300
A SMALL TEAM OF RESEARCHERS HAS
BEEN TRYING TO DISCOVER THE
NAMES OF THOSE CHILDREN BURIED
HERE, BUT FOR DECADES, THE

36:09.367 --> 36:14.839
GOVERNMENT AND THE CHURCH HAD
BEEN RELUCTANT TO SHARE THEIR
RECORDS.
CHIEF CADMUS DELORME IS TRYING

36:14.906 --> 36:21.012
TO GET ANSWERS.
DO YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE ALL
CHILDREN?
>> Chief Cadmus Delorme: WE

36:21.078 --> 36:28.519
CAN'T VERIFY HOW MUCH ARE
CHILDREN, BUT BASED ON THE
RESEARCH WE'RE DOING, A LOT OF
THEM WERE CHILDREN THAT WERE

36:28.586 --> 36:36.327
FORCED TO GO TO THE MARIEVAL
RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, AND DIED IN
THE MARIEVAL RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.
>> Cooper: CHIEF DELORME SAYS HE

36:36.394 --> 36:44.035
HOPES TO GIVE THE UNIDENTIFIED
CHILDREN A DIGNITY IN DEATH THAT
THEY NEVER RECEIVED IN LIFE.
>> Delorme: I WANT TO MAKE SURE

36:44.101 --> 36:52.843
THAT CANADA KNOWS THE TRUTH,
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T MOVE TO
RECONCILIATION UNTIL YOU ACCEPT
THE TRUTH.

36:52.910 --> 36:59.283
>> Cooper: THE DISCOVERIES OF
THE GRAVES OPENED DEEP WOUNDS.
MORE THAN A DOZEN CHURCHES HAVE
BEEN VANDALIZED OR DESTROYED,

36:59.350 --> 37:05.289
AND THOUSANDS HAVE MARCHED,
DEMANDING THE POPE APOLOGIZE AND
THE CHURCHES OPEN ARCHIVES TO
HELP IDENTIFY ANY MISSING

37:05.356 --> 37:12.396
CHILDREN.
INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES ACROSS
THE COUNTRY HAVE BEGUN
CONDUCTING THEIR OWN SEARCHES,

37:12.463 --> 37:17.368
USING GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR.
>> Kisha Supernant: WE'VE LAID
OUT A NUMBER OF GRIDS THROUGHOUT
THIS LANDSCAPE.

37:17.435 --> 37:22.940
>> Cooper: ARCHEOLOGISTS KISHA
SUPERNANT AND TERRY CLARK SAY 35
UNMARKED GRAVES HAVE BEEN
DISCOVERED AT THE MUSKOWEKWAN

37:23.007 --> 37:27.945
SCHOOL.
>> Terry Clark: THERE IS
SOMETHING GOING ON THERE THAT IS
NOT NATURAL.

37:28.012 --> 37:33.618
>> Cooper: WHEN WE WERE THERE
THIS PAST OCTOBER, THEY FOUND
WHAT APPEARED TO BE ANOTHER.
ACCORDING TO SURVIVOR ACCOUNTS,

37:33.684 --> 37:41.492
CHILDREN SOMETIMES HAD TO DIG
THEIR CLASSMATES' GRAVES.
THE PRIESTS OR THE SCHOOL
OFFICIALS WOULD FORCE THE KIDS

37:41.559 --> 37:46.063
TO DIG OTHER CHILDREN'S GRAVES?
>> Supernant: YEP, YEP.
CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING, LIKE, TEN
OR 11, AND DIGGING A GRAVE FOR

37:46.130 --> 37:54.405
YOUR CLASSMATE-- WHAT THAT MUST
HAVE BEEN LIKE?
>> Cooper: KISHA SUPERNANT SAYS
THE SEARCH FOR UNMARKED GRAVES

37:54.472 --> 38:00.244
WILL CONTINUE FOR YEARS.
>> Supernant: THIS IS VERY
EMOTIONAL WORK.
IT'S VERY DEVASTATING WORK.

38:00.311 --> 38:05.449
IT'S HEARTBREAKING FOR EVERYONE
WHO'S INVOLVED.
>> Cooper: YOU FEEL THAT TOO?
>> Supernant: I DO.

38:05.516 --> 38:12.556
OUR COMMUNITIES STILL FEEL THE
IMPACTS OF THESE INSTITUTIONS IN
OUR EVERYDAY LIVES.
WE'RE WAY OVER-REPRESENTED IN

38:12.623 --> 38:17.561
CHILD WELFARE AND ADOPTIONS AND
FOSTER CARE.
WE'RE WAY OVER-REPRESENTED IN
THE PRISONS.

38:17.628 --> 38:24.468
YOU CAN DRAW A DIRECT LINE WITH
THAT TO THESE PLACES, AND THE
PAIN OF THAT, THAT HAS BEEN
PASSED ON FROM GENERATION TO

38:24.535 --> 38:30.474
GENERATION.
>> Ed Bitternose: I STARTED
SCHOOL HERE IN 1958.
>> Cooper: ED BITTERNOSE, WHO IS

38:30.541 --> 38:38.783
CREE, UNDERSTANDS THAT PAIN.
HE WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD WHEN HE
WAS TAKEN TO THE MUSKOWEKWAN
SCHOOL.

38:38.849 --> 38:44.522
HIS PARENTS LIVED WITHIN SIGHT
OF THE SCHOOL, AND WHEN HE TRIED
TO RUN AWAY, HE SAYS THE PRIESTS
FORCED HIM TO KNEEL ON A BROOM

38:44.588 --> 38:50.928
HANDLE FOR THREE DAYS.
>> Bitternose: THAT'S WHERE MY
HOUSE WAS.
I WOULD SIT HERE AND WONDER WHY

38:50.995 --> 38:57.668
I COULDN'T BE HOME.
>> Cooper: THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
DEVASTATING.
>> Bitternose: YEAH.

38:57.735 --> 39:05.509
>> Cooper: IT WASN'T ONLY ADULTS
HE FEARED.
SOME STUDENTS, THEMSELVES
VICTIMS OF ABUSE, PREYED ON

39:05.576 --> 39:13.517
OTHER CHILDREN.
>> Cooper: WERE YOU ABUSED HERE?
>> Bitternose: YEAH, MM-HMM.
ACTUALLY, IN THIS ROOM HERE, BY

39:13.584 --> 39:18.856
ONE OF THE-- ONE OF THE-- ONE OF
THE BOYS.
>> Cooper: IN THIS VERY ROOM?
>> Bitternose: THIS VERY AREA

39:18.923 --> 39:25.563
HERE.
>> Cooper: LATER, HE SAYS, HE
WAS ALSO SEXUALLY MOLESTED BY A
NUN.

39:25.629 --> 39:30.568
WHEN HE LEFT SCHOOL, HE WAS
RUDDERLESS AND VIOLENT, AND
TURNED TO ALCOHOL.
WHEN HE GOT MARRIED, HE SAYS, HE

39:30.634 --> 39:36.540
DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO SHOW
AFFECTION.
YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT LOVE WAS?
>> Bitternose: NO.

39:36.607 --> 39:44.915
NO.
BECAUSE I NEVER FELT IT HERE.
I DIDN'T START SAYING I LOVED
HER TILL WE WERE MARRIED ABOUT

39:44.982 --> 39:49.220
40 YEARS, AND THEN I WAS VERY
CAREFUL HOW I SAID IT.
>> Cooper: YOU DIDN'T SAY TO
YOUR WIFE FOR 40 YEARS THAT YOU

39:49.286 --> 39:56.827
LOVED HER?
>> Bitternose: MM-HMM, YEAH.
>> Cooper: HE SAYS HIS LIFE
CHANGED WHEN HE BEGAN RE-

39:56.894 --> 40:03.768
DISCOVERING HIS CREE CULTURE.
RAISING BUFFALO AND SHARING
TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE WITH
CHILDREN BROUGHT HEALING, AND

40:03.834 --> 40:09.406
FINALLY, AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE
WORD LOVE.
YOU CAN SAY THAT NOW?
>> Bitternose: I CAN SAY THAT

40:09.473 --> 40:14.745
NOW.
AND-- AND IT FEELS GOOD.
AND I STILL JOKE WITH MY WIFE
ABOUT THAT.

40:14.812 --> 40:18.415
"DON'T SAY THAT TOO LOUD," YOU
KNOW.
>> Cooper: SO, YOU CAN SAY IT,
YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO SAY IT

40:18.482 --> 40:21.418
TOO LOUD?
>> Bitternose: YES, UH-HUH.
YEAH.
>> Cooper: OKAY.

40:21.485 --> 40:25.556
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING.
>> Bitternose: YES, THAT'S WHAT
SHE SAYS.

40:25.623 --> 40:33.497
>> Cooper: AS FOR LEONA WOLF,
HER LIFE AND THE LIVES OF HER
CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN HAVE
BEEN PLAGUED BY VIOLENCE AND

40:33.564 --> 40:41.505
SUBSTANCE ABUSE--
INTERGENERATIONAL TRAUMA, SHE
SAYS, THAT BEGAN THE DAY HER OWN
MOTHER WAS SENT TO SCHOOL AT

40:41.572 --> 40:45.509
MUSKOWEKWAN.
DID YOU SEE THE IMPACT OF THIS
PLACE ON YOUR MOM?
>> Wolf: YEAH.

40:45.576 --> 40:51.282
YEAH.
>> Cooper: HOW?
>> Wolf: YEAH, BY DRINKING A
LOT, BEING MEAN TO ME.

40:51.348 --> 40:58.556
AND IT IMPACT US, ME AND MY
BROTHER, AND MY SIBLINGS.
>> Cooper: WHAT WAS DONE TO HER,
SHE PASSED ON TO YOU.

40:58.622 --> 41:05.563
AND WHAT WAS DONE TO YOU AND
OTHERS HERE...
>> Wolf: WAS PASSED ON TO MY
CHILDREN.

41:05.629 --> 41:16.941
THIS IS WHY SOMETIMES I GO INTO
MY RAGE OF ANGER, AND I CRY,
BECAUSE IT ALL-- IT WAS ALL DONE
TO US, ALL OF US.

41:17.007 --> 41:21.679
BUT IT'S GOING TO STOP NOW, YOU
KNOW?
IT IS.
>> Cooper: YOU BELIEVE THAT?

41:21.745 --> 41:31.689
>> Wolf: I'M GOING TO-- I'M
BREAKING THE CYCLE, WITH MY
GREAT-GRANDCHILDREN.
HAIL MARY, FULL OF GRACE.

41:31.755 --> 41:37.595
>> Cooper: LEONA WOLF HAS
RETURNED TO HER TRADITIONS AS
WELL.
WALKING THE HALLS OF

41:37.661 --> 41:45.369
MUSKOWEKWAN, SHE BEGAN TO SING
"HAIL MARY," A PRAYER SHE WAS
FORCED TO LEARN HERE LONG AGO.
>> Wolf: ♪ HEY-A, HEY-A, HEY-O.

41:45.436 --> 41:48.973
HEY, HEY-O, HEY-A, HEY-A.
♪ HEY, HEY-A, HEY, HEY-A, HEY-A,
HEY-O. ♪
>> Cooper: NOW, SHE SINGS IT HER

41:49.039 --> 41:54.578
OWN WAY.
>> Wolf: ♪ HEY, HEY-A, HEY-A,
HEY-A, HEY-O. ♪
>> Cooper: THAT'S NOT HOW YOU

41:54.645 --> 42:00.017
SANG IT HERE WHEN YOU WERE IN
SCHOOL, THOUGH, WAS IT?
>> Wolf: NOPE.
>> Cooper: YOU MADE PEACE WITH

42:00.084 --> 42:08.158
THE VIRGIN MARY BY SINGING THAT
SONG?
>> Wolf: YEAH, AND I MADE PEACE
WITH MYSELF.

42:10.494 --> 42:17.635
>> Stahl: NEXT SUNDAY, WHILE
MUCH OF THE COUNTRY IS CHEERING
ON THE BENGALS OR RAMS, "60
MINUTES PRESENTS" WILL BE HERE

42:17.701 --> 42:24.708
TO OFFER "CHEERS" OF OUR OWN.
WE'LL RAISE A GLASS TO THE WINE
INDUSTRY AS CHANGING WEATHER AND
CLIMATE CONDITIONS AFFECT HOW--

42:24.775 --> 42:31.282
AND EVEN WHERE-- WINE GRAPES ARE
GROWN.
AND, WE'LL LIFT A PINT TO THE
ONCE-ENDANGERED TRADITIONAL

42:31.348 --> 42:38.722
ENGLISH PUB, A CORNERSTONE OF
BRITISH CULTURE, NOW BATTLING
BACK FROM COVID AND NEAR-
EXTINCTION.

42:38.789 --> 42:47.031
I'M LESLEY STAHL.
WE'LL BACK IN TWO WEEKS WITH A
BRAND-NEW EDITIO

42:48.499 --> 42:56.573
Captioning funded by CBS
and FORD.
We go further, so you can.
