00:00.459 --> 00:02.002
Previously on Hawaii Five-O...

00:02.002 --> 00:04.463
JOE: How's that water, tadpoles?
That toasty enough for you?

00:04.463 --> 00:07.216
ALL:
Hoo-yah!

00:07.216 --> 00:08.967
JOE:
A Navy SEAL is a man.

00:08.967 --> 00:10.594
A man who will
lay down his life.

00:10.594 --> 00:12.971
A man who will persevere
in the face of adversity.

00:12.971 --> 00:14.431
There was a time
when Joe White could've

00:14.431 --> 00:15.807
given up on me, and he didn't.

00:15.807 --> 00:17.518
There's 20 of them
and two of us.

00:17.518 --> 00:18.810
We're gonna be dead
in a couple of minutes.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.437
We're not dying today, son.

00:20.437 --> 00:21.980
STEVE:
And if he's in that compound,

00:21.980 --> 00:23.565
there's no way I'm about
to start giving up on him.

00:23.565 --> 00:24.566
Let's go home, Joe.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.946
Are you telling me there's
a mole inside the CIA?

00:28.946 --> 00:30.822
Who is that?
DANNY: That's Agent Greer.

00:30.822 --> 00:33.116
The last time I saw you,
you asked me why I did it.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.827
Well, here's my
answer: why not?

00:35.827 --> 00:37.829
Do you remember
Marrakech, Steve?

00:37.829 --> 00:39.456
I always worried our enemies
would know it was us

00:39.456 --> 00:40.707
and retaliate.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.125
You know as well as I do,

00:42.125 --> 00:44.002
we were just following orders.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.546
That won't matter to the people
who want answers.

You have T. rex arms.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.942
Yeah? Then how'd I tie
the game up, genius?

01:06.942 --> 01:08.860
Okay, settle down, nutjobs.
(phone ringing)

01:08.860 --> 01:10.904
Score's nine-nine. For the win.

01:10.904 --> 01:13.365
Hey, Mark.
Phone for you.

01:13.365 --> 01:15.367
Who is it?
They didn't say, hon.

01:24.584 --> 01:26.378
I need you to grab your go bag

01:26.378 --> 01:29.256
and get your family to safety.

01:29.256 --> 01:31.174
Joe, what's going on?
Brewster and Linehan are dead.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.968
I've already talked to Cole.
What about McGarrett?

01:32.968 --> 01:34.136
He's my next call.

01:34.136 --> 01:36.221
After you get your family

01:36.221 --> 01:37.514
you call me from a secure line.

Where the hell've you been?

04:06.663 --> 04:07.789
Hi, Joe.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.458
You're in danger.
Thanks, buddy.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.251
I just figured that out.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.586
I take it someone
just paid you a visit.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.046
Did you put him down?
Nope.

04:15.046 --> 04:17.382
You want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

04:17.382 --> 04:18.800
Someone's trying to take out
the Morocco team.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.635
They're using professional
hitters to do it.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.095
Brewster, Linehan, and Howard

04:22.095 --> 04:23.472
are dead.

04:23.472 --> 04:27.434
Mm-hmm. You got a plan, Joe?

04:27.434 --> 04:28.810
I'm gonna get on a plane,
I'm coming to you.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.688
We're gonna get to safety,
regroup.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.815
Figure out our next move.

04:33.815 --> 04:38.820
Or we can use this situation
to our advantage right now.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.363
Strike while the iron's hot.

04:40.363 --> 04:42.908
While they're not suspecting it,
we hit 'em hard.

04:42.908 --> 04:45.744
Sounds like you already have
a plan.

04:45.744 --> 04:48.288
I might.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.998
I got to make a phone call.

05:00.926 --> 05:03.345
(exhales)

05:03.345 --> 05:05.805
TANI:
Oh, my God.

05:05.805 --> 05:09.267
How, how are you
even still alive?

05:09.267 --> 05:11.186
Most of that blood's not mine.

05:11.186 --> 05:13.396
I can't believe
I wasn't here for you.

05:13.396 --> 05:16.733
This guy was a pro, man.
He knew what he was doing.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.735
It wouldn't have
made a difference.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.404
He knew when, he knew when
I was gonna be alone.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.740
I got a question: why haven't we
looped HPD in on this?

05:23.740 --> 05:25.617
TANI: Right. I mean...
th-there's a contract killer

05:25.617 --> 05:28.036
loose on Oahu, he's
bleeding like a stuck pig.

05:28.036 --> 05:30.163
We should-- shouldn't we
get a description out?

05:30.163 --> 05:31.623
We should be canvassing.
ADAM:
Yeah, I'll get CSU over here.

05:31.623 --> 05:33.750
Maybe they can get a match
on this blood.
Adam. No, Adam, Adam.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.585
Stop.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.504
I know why
I was targeted.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.381
This is blowback
from an operation

05:39.381 --> 05:42.050
that I was on back in 2002.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.636
I was part of
a six-man SEAL team;

05:44.636 --> 05:46.054
we went into Morocco,
we took out a high-value target.

05:46.054 --> 05:50.225
Over the last 24 hours,
three of my team

05:50.225 --> 05:51.601
have been assassinated. Myself,
Joe White, and another SEAL

05:51.601 --> 05:53.311
by the name of Cole

05:53.311 --> 05:55.313
are the last men standing.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.148
So you know who's behind this?

05:57.148 --> 05:59.901
Because if you do,

05:59.901 --> 06:01.528
why are we sitting around here,
talking about this

06:01.528 --> 06:03.154
instead of going out there,
going after these people,

06:03.154 --> 06:05.073
and shutting 'em down,
like, fast. Like, right now.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.075
It's not that simple.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.868
The man we killed

06:08.868 --> 06:10.579
headed up an entire
terrorist network.

06:10.579 --> 06:13.748
There could be hundreds,
probably more like thousands

06:13.748 --> 06:15.250
of people looking for revenge
behind this.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.544
We got to draw them out.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.713
But the only way we can do that
is if they believe

06:19.713 --> 06:21.840
we're vulnerable.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.717
So that's why you didn't want
to involve HPD.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.385
It's got to be quiet.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.512
It has to be off the books.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.473
Yes, I need your help.

06:30.473 --> 06:31.975
Please stop talking to us
like we're a bunch of strangers.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.518
You need some help,
you know you got it.

06:33.518 --> 06:34.978
Just tell us what you need.

06:34.978 --> 06:37.439
Your first crime scene's
in the kitchen.

06:37.439 --> 06:40.567
I need an ID on the guy who
tried to take pieces off me.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.527
Right, you got a gun
for ballistics, his
blood on the floor.

06:42.527 --> 06:43.528
Right, he left
a lot of blood.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.488
I can get Noelani
to run this.

06:45.488 --> 06:48.533
I'll make sure she gives
the results directly to us.

06:48.533 --> 06:50.285
Hey, should I call Danny?
Let him know what's going on?

06:50.285 --> 06:51.995
Please, don't do that.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.163
Okay, he's on the mainland,

06:53.163 --> 06:54.331
he's-he's touring colleges
with Grace.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.082
He gets a whiff of this,
he's gonna be

06:56.082 --> 06:57.917
on the first plane back here.
We don't need that.

06:57.917 --> 07:01.546
All right-- oh, hey.
One more thing.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.882
While we're out here looking
for your new best friend,

07:03.882 --> 07:06.176
what's your move? Because
I-I know how you get down.

07:06.176 --> 07:07.636
It ain't gonna be
you go underground

07:07.636 --> 07:09.638
and-and the Navy is gonna
stash you someplace,

07:09.638 --> 07:10.722
so...

07:10.722 --> 07:12.307
what are you gonna do?

07:12.307 --> 07:14.267
Joe and I got a plan.

07:17.187 --> 07:18.021
JUNIOR:
If SEALs are involved,

07:18.021 --> 07:19.105
I'm coming with you.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.691
I need you to trust me.
All right?

07:21.691 --> 07:22.984
Okay.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.613
STEVE:
Thank you.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.788
It's just me and Joe
on this one.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.374
You want to avenge team guys,
you do it from here.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.209
And don't come looking for me.
You're not gonna find me.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.339
Copy that.

07:44.339 --> 07:45.674
Thank you, brother.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.509
One question.

07:47.509 --> 07:50.220
SEAL identities are classified.
Correct.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.681
Especially on HVT ops.

07:52.681 --> 07:53.682
Which means someone
with clearance

07:53.682 --> 07:56.434
had to leak those names.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.314
I'm pretty sure
I know who it was.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.233
(lock buzzes)

08:10.448 --> 08:12.867
I'll admit,
you look well for a dead man.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.788
Yeah, but I'm not dead.

08:16.788 --> 08:17.539
Not yet.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.544
JUNIOR:
Kieren Brewster in Kansas City,

08:22.544 --> 08:24.879
John Linehan
outside of Chicago,

08:24.879 --> 08:26.798
Mark Howard,
Torrance, California.

08:26.798 --> 08:30.051
No evidence, no
witnesses, no nothing.

08:30.051 --> 08:33.805
Simultaneous, coordinated hits
on ex-Navy SEALs.

08:33.805 --> 08:37.225
That takes an extraordinary
amount of expertise to pull off.

08:37.225 --> 08:40.687
Guys, Noelani just got a DNA hit
on McGarrett's attacker.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.021
Check it out.

08:42.021 --> 08:43.732
Meet Kasper Bauer.

08:43.732 --> 08:45.817
German national.
Yeah.

08:45.817 --> 08:48.153
That is right.
Also ex-military.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.655
He's currently on an Interpol
watch list due to his penchant

08:50.655 --> 08:52.782
for robbing banks and also
committing the occasional

08:52.782 --> 08:54.826
murder for hire.
Okay, well,

08:54.826 --> 08:56.453
if this guy got
on the island,

08:56.453 --> 08:58.288
safe money says he's traveling
under an assumed name.

08:58.288 --> 09:00.415
Sure.
All right, we can't
let him leave Oahu.

09:00.415 --> 09:01.708
I'm gonna call the TSA.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.376
I'm gonna set an alert
for ports and airports.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.754
Yeah, and we're gonna reach out
to every island pharmacy.

09:05.754 --> 09:07.380
McGarrett cut this guy up
pretty good.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.716
And since Bauer's a wanted man
with military training...

09:09.716 --> 09:11.426
There's no way in the world
he's gonna show his face

09:11.426 --> 09:12.886
at a hospital.
Good thinking.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.806
I know it was you.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.934
I know it was you who leaked
the names of the men on my team,

09:19.934 --> 09:21.728
in Morocco.
It had to be you.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.563
Nobody else knew about it.
It was a black op.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.981
It was off the books.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.316
Well, that's one way
of putting it.

09:26.316 --> 09:28.151
The other way would be to say
"it was illegal."

09:28.151 --> 09:30.195
We were soldiers
following orders

09:30.195 --> 09:32.071
that were handed
down by you.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.656
You are such a good boy, Steve.

09:33.656 --> 09:34.699
Always doing the right thing.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.618
But, you know,

09:36.618 --> 09:39.120
you did come all this way
to see me.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.080
So I guess, for old time's sake,

09:41.080 --> 09:42.540
we can be honest
with each other.

09:42.540 --> 09:45.543
Let's say I did what you say.

09:45.543 --> 09:50.131
You can't outrun
these people forever.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.634
Who can't I outrun?
W-Who paid for these hits?

09:52.634 --> 09:54.469
Someone with money
who doesn't like you, Steve.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.513
Well, they didn't get what
they paid for, did they?

09:56.513 --> 09:59.265
Look, I'm sitting right
in front of you. I'm fine.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.892
Cole's fine.

10:00.892 --> 10:02.644
Three down, two to go.

10:04.521 --> 10:05.605
Me, Joe White, Cole.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.440
Joe White?

10:07.440 --> 10:09.526
He died in an air strike.
What are you talking about?

10:09.526 --> 10:11.236
Joe White's alive and well.

10:11.236 --> 10:12.529
I personally pulled him
out of that cage

10:12.529 --> 10:14.447
before the missile
hit that building.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.953
All I can tell you
is these people

10:19.953 --> 10:22.997
are rich,

10:22.997 --> 10:25.416
motivated and relentless.

10:25.416 --> 10:28.962
So, you and Cole and Joe
should enjoy the time you have.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.591
Was that all, Steve? I'd like
to go back to my cell now,

10:33.591 --> 10:35.134
if you don't mind.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.178
Yep, that's all.

10:37.178 --> 10:40.306
Yeah, except, unfortunately, you
won't be going back to your cell

10:40.306 --> 10:42.976
because I made a call
on the way here,

10:42.976 --> 10:44.519
spoke to the director of the
Federal Bureau of Prisons,

10:44.519 --> 10:47.897
and he and I both agree
that you should be moved

10:47.897 --> 10:49.691
somewhere much less comfortable.

10:49.691 --> 10:50.984
I know, it's crazy.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.402
I didn't think
your accommodations

10:52.402 --> 10:55.822
could get any worse, either,
but... who knew?

10:55.822 --> 10:57.699
Give Joe my regards.

10:59.826 --> 11:02.620
(lock buzzes)

11:06.374 --> 11:08.376
Wow. That good, huh?

11:08.376 --> 11:10.211
You talk to the warden?

11:10.211 --> 11:12.171
Yeah. They're bringing Kojima
down from Unit 3,

11:12.171 --> 11:14.215
but not without
plenty of red tape.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.301
I'll talk with him
as soon as I can.
All right.

11:16.301 --> 11:17.844
If he's as connected in here
as you say he is,

11:17.844 --> 11:19.053
we should be able to find out

11:19.053 --> 11:21.306
who Greer's talking to
on the outside.

11:21.306 --> 11:22.724
Guy's been here 29 years.
Anything going on,

11:22.724 --> 11:23.933
he knows about it.

11:23.933 --> 11:26.477
I appreciate this, you know?

11:26.477 --> 11:28.313
Well, hey, don't thank me yet.

11:28.313 --> 11:29.856
All right? Kojima owes
a favor to my father,

11:29.856 --> 11:31.357
not to me.

11:31.357 --> 11:34.027
Here's hoping
it's transferable.

11:34.027 --> 11:34.903
(quietly):
I understand.

11:36.905 --> 11:38.072
Hey, Steve?

11:38.072 --> 11:39.657
What?

11:39.657 --> 11:42.076
You're really not gonna tell us
where you're going?

11:42.076 --> 11:44.996
Good luck with the old man.

11:47.749 --> 11:49.792
(sighs)

11:49.792 --> 11:51.461
(lock buzzes)

12:02.805 --> 12:04.974
She take the bait?

12:04.974 --> 12:07.060
Yeah.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.895
Yeah, now that she knows

12:08.895 --> 12:11.022
you're alive, it's only
a matter of time before, uh,

12:11.022 --> 12:14.233
she gets the word out and they
figure out where we're headed.

12:14.233 --> 12:18.821
There's a lone ponderosa pine
just west of my land.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.865
It's a thing of beauty.

12:20.865 --> 12:23.159
They say it's one of
the oldest trees in the state.

12:26.245 --> 12:29.916
You sure no one at Five-O
knows about the ranch?

12:29.916 --> 12:31.709
No one knows, Joe.
Not even Danny.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.002
Good.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.463
I don't want them rolling up
playing hero.

12:35.463 --> 12:39.092
I know you gave very clear
instructions, but knowing them,

12:39.092 --> 12:40.301
we better
power down the phones

12:40.301 --> 12:41.803
so they can't track us.
Joe...

12:41.803 --> 12:43.221
Plane's fueled up,
the airstrip's 20 minutes away.

12:43.221 --> 12:48.518
It pays to have friends

12:48.518 --> 12:49.185
in the Agency.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.273
Come on, the clock is ticking
on our head start.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.233
What are we waiting for?

12:57.151 --> 13:01.114
You sent Cole into the wind
until this is all over, right?

13:01.114 --> 13:02.323
And?
Yeah.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.450
Why don't you join him, Joe?

13:04.450 --> 13:05.785
I mean, you've been
in the shadows

13:05.785 --> 13:07.620
for a year and a half.
Why don't you stay there?

13:07.620 --> 13:10.498
Now, where is this
coming from, son?

13:10.498 --> 13:13.126
The plan makes sense.
Your plan.
Yeah.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.336
Within the hour, hostiles will
be headed for the ranch.

13:15.336 --> 13:17.588
Right. You don't
have to be there.

13:17.588 --> 13:20.425
You don't have to be there, Joe.
I got this.

13:20.425 --> 13:21.968
Steve, this hit could come

13:21.968 --> 13:24.345
within three hours,

13:24.345 --> 13:25.888
three months, three years.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.265
I'm not gonna spend
the rest of my life

13:27.265 --> 13:29.308
looking over my shoulder.

13:29.308 --> 13:33.229
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna
let you have all the fun.

13:35.398 --> 13:38.568
Drop it! Drop that needle
right now, get 'em up!

13:38.568 --> 13:39.902
Get your hands up, get 'em up.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.821
Tani, Junior,

13:41.821 --> 13:45.241
I found our German friend
in the gas station bathroom.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.285
TANI:
Copy. On our way.

13:47.285 --> 13:49.454
You got any weapons on you?

13:49.454 --> 13:50.413
No.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.877
Talked to the pharmacy where
you got your little supplies.

13:55.877 --> 13:58.963
Figured you'd be someplace close

13:58.963 --> 14:00.882
where you could do
your little doctor act.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.928
Yeah, must be my lucky day,
finding you like this.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.139
Maybe I ought to get online, bet
a little something on the Bears.

14:08.139 --> 14:09.223
What you think?

14:09.223 --> 14:11.642
Take me to a hospital.

14:11.642 --> 14:12.977
Nein.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.521
You must. You're police.

14:15.521 --> 14:18.608
The only thing I must do
is stay black and die.

14:18.608 --> 14:21.277
And no, I'm not the police,
I'm Five-O.

14:21.277 --> 14:22.445
And the guy you
tried to kill--

14:22.445 --> 14:26.657
my friend-- also Five-O.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.659
So if there's any place
I must take you,

14:28.659 --> 14:30.828
it's wherever
I damn well please,

14:30.828 --> 14:32.663
and you better believe
it ain't gonna be a hospital.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.924
Who lives there?

14:42.924 --> 14:45.468
Graham Dexter
and his fourth wife.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.053
STEVE: And you're half a mile
up the road?

14:47.053 --> 14:48.471
They're gonna be a little
close to the action.

14:48.471 --> 14:49.680
Don't you think, Joe?

14:49.680 --> 14:51.182
Yeah, which is why
I packed them off

14:51.182 --> 14:53.351
to Missoula
while this goes down.

14:53.351 --> 14:55.103
Ah. Smart.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.813
You make up an excuse?

14:56.813 --> 14:58.022
He's ex-Army. I didn't have to.

15:05.113 --> 15:06.531
What's with the car?
You didn't put this place

15:06.531 --> 15:07.448
on Airbnb, did you, Joe?

15:09.367 --> 15:11.410
I don't know
what that is, so no.

15:33.307 --> 15:36.144
(water running)

15:36.144 --> 15:37.520
(water stops)

15:38.855 --> 15:40.439
(door closes)
Hey!

15:40.439 --> 15:42.984
Whoa-- don't shoot.

15:42.984 --> 15:45.361
What are you, nuts?

15:45.361 --> 15:46.988
(chuckles):
Hey, man.

15:46.988 --> 15:49.157
What are you doing here?
I almost shot you in the face.

15:49.157 --> 15:50.575
Where else would I be? You think
I'm gonna let you jokers

15:50.575 --> 15:51.784
face these guys on your own?

15:51.784 --> 15:53.619
STEVE:
How'd you get here?

15:53.619 --> 15:55.538
Buddy's a pilot.
He flew me out,

15:55.538 --> 15:56.956
rented that wreck
at the airport.

15:56.956 --> 16:00.001
Cole, you shouldn't have come.

16:00.001 --> 16:02.253
Well, let's-let's see if you
still feel that way

16:02.253 --> 16:04.755
after you check out
the toys I brought.

16:04.755 --> 16:08.050
Who's your daddy?

16:08.050 --> 16:09.051
Yeah!

16:09.051 --> 16:10.052
(soft laughter)

16:10.052 --> 16:11.512
Not bad.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.309
Now let me
show you something.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.602
Damn, Joe.

16:17.602 --> 16:20.062
Where'd you
get all this?

16:20.062 --> 16:21.272
JOE:
Chain of custody

16:21.272 --> 16:23.065
is an inexact science.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.276
If we, uh, if we can't
take these guys,

16:25.276 --> 16:26.861
it's not gonna be
for lack of firepower.

16:26.861 --> 16:29.614
Well, we don't even know
how many are coming,

16:29.614 --> 16:31.407
or if they'll even show at all.

16:31.407 --> 16:34.118
No, they're hired guns. They
want to get paid? They'll show.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.745
We don't know how much time it's
gonna take them to get here,

16:35.745 --> 16:38.331
so we'd better prep
like there's no time at all.

16:38.331 --> 16:42.376
Be honest with me, what do you
give our odds, about 50/50?

16:43.920 --> 16:46.255
That's one thing I always liked
about you, Cole.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.174
You're an optimist.

17:16.494 --> 17:18.246
How's it look?

17:19.413 --> 17:20.831
Festive.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.293
Word came down.

17:24.293 --> 17:25.461
The order stands.

17:25.461 --> 17:26.462
JOE: The order
was for an op

17:26.462 --> 17:28.673
in a compound that
was empty of everyone

17:28.673 --> 17:30.383
but Kamal Hassan
and his guards.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.592
They're still in there.
STEVE:
Yeah, along with

17:31.592 --> 17:33.177
25 women and children.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.346
Yes, because we don't
control the weather,

17:35.346 --> 17:36.847
not yet.

17:36.847 --> 17:39.600
So some kid cousin's
birthday party got rained out

17:39.600 --> 17:41.811
and moved to the covered
courtyard. Not ideal,

17:41.811 --> 17:43.312
but not a deal breaker.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.231
Can I have a word?

17:52.071 --> 17:55.408
We can execute the mission;
that doesn't mean we should.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.742
Taking out
a known terrorist is one thing.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.370
Risking civilian lives
is another.

17:59.370 --> 18:01.247
Hell, we're breaking all kinds
of laws just being here.

18:01.247 --> 18:04.333
We're not at war
with this country.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.918
We're at war with anyone
who harbors terrorists.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.503
It's not just
the insurgents

18:07.503 --> 18:09.964
Hassan is backing
in Afghanistan.

18:09.964 --> 18:12.008
Fresh intel has him
planning a major attack

18:12.008 --> 18:13.759
on U.S. interests overseas.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.720
We need him gone, and
all those materials

18:15.720 --> 18:18.097
in that compound
rolled up.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.890
This is happening.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.183
STEVE:
Maybe Joe's right.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.351
We-we just take a minute. Right?

18:22.351 --> 18:23.728
Wait for a clearer shot?

18:23.728 --> 18:25.354
MARK: Yeah, if
we ever get one.

18:25.354 --> 18:27.315
Hassan hasn't surfaced in years.

18:27.315 --> 18:28.774
We lose him tonight,

18:28.774 --> 18:30.192
we could lose him forever.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.196
Cole.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.824
We got to do what we got to do.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.455
We're going in.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.585
Wall Street yahoos, right?
And they drive up,

18:47.585 --> 18:49.003
they charter the boat,

18:49.003 --> 18:50.838
except they don't
want to fish.

18:50.838 --> 18:53.132
Yeah?
No, they just want to

18:53.132 --> 18:57.011
get wasted and post pictures
of themselves with the rods.

18:57.011 --> 18:58.554
(chuckles)
I bet their checks

18:58.554 --> 19:00.348
don't bounce.
Oh, you're telling me.

19:00.348 --> 19:03.851
They fund my entire lifestyle.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.144
And what kind
of lifestyle is that?

19:05.144 --> 19:06.937
What, are you kidding?
Rhode Island's

19:06.937 --> 19:08.314
most eligible bachelor,

19:08.314 --> 19:10.316
the Titan
of Thirsty Thursdays,

19:10.316 --> 19:11.776
the Lion of Ladies' Night.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.612
Steve, give me a hand.

19:14.612 --> 19:16.864
You got it. Hey, Lion?

19:16.864 --> 19:18.074
(chuckles):
Whatever you call yourself,

19:18.074 --> 19:19.283
you mind laying
those Claymores, please?

19:19.283 --> 19:20.951
On it.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.753
It's been four hours since Greer
could've got the word out.

19:30.753 --> 19:32.380
They could be
arriving any time.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.256
Yeah, as soon as we put
the 240 together

19:34.256 --> 19:36.300
and Cole finishes
setting a perimeter,

19:36.300 --> 19:38.761
he's gonna take
sniper overwatch.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.304
JOE: All the teams I worked
with, he's still the best shot

19:40.304 --> 19:42.139
I ever saw.

19:42.139 --> 19:44.141
That's high praise,
coming from you.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.684
I know I told him
to disappear,

19:45.684 --> 19:47.353
but honestly,
I'm glad he showed.

19:47.353 --> 19:50.189
And I'm glad I
let you come.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.316
Did you just say let me come?

19:52.316 --> 19:54.402
This was my plan.
I brought you in.

19:54.402 --> 19:55.361
What are you talking about?

19:55.361 --> 19:56.445
You brought me to my ranch?

19:56.445 --> 19:57.488
This is my own ranch, Steve.

19:57.488 --> 19:59.657
That's a fair point.

19:59.657 --> 20:01.742
Now do me a favor

20:01.742 --> 20:03.619
before I drop this
on your foot.

20:03.619 --> 20:05.037
Go get the cotter pins
out of my bag in the armory.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.123
All right.

20:07.123 --> 20:09.125
Yo, side pocket?

20:09.125 --> 20:10.501
JOE:
Yeah.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.140
What happened?

20:24.140 --> 20:25.683
You get lost?

20:25.683 --> 20:27.143
No.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.277
(grunts)

20:38.195 --> 20:42.908
KOJIMA: I was wondering
who my mystery visitor would be.

20:42.908 --> 20:46.370
I could have guessed
a thousand names,

20:46.370 --> 20:49.623
followed by a thousand more,

20:49.623 --> 20:53.752
before landing on the son
of Hiro Noshimuri.

20:53.752 --> 20:57.381
My father died before
he could collect

20:57.381 --> 20:59.800
on that favor you owed him.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.052
I need that favor today.

21:02.052 --> 21:06.390
This must be about the woman
in the special wing.

21:06.390 --> 21:09.435
She's CIA.
Was.

21:09.435 --> 21:12.396
We know she has a channel
to the outside.

21:12.396 --> 21:13.647
I need a name.

21:13.647 --> 21:15.608
And you think I can provide it.

21:15.608 --> 21:18.027
Well, from what I hear,

21:18.027 --> 21:19.320
there's very little
in this prison

21:19.320 --> 21:21.030
that you don't provide.

21:21.030 --> 21:25.659
Such a reputation is built on
nurturing relationships,

21:25.659 --> 21:28.078
not torching them.

21:28.078 --> 21:30.915
Well, my hope is that
your friendship with my father

21:30.915 --> 21:32.082
carries the day.

21:32.082 --> 21:34.043
He has my respect.

21:34.043 --> 21:36.128
But he was not my friend.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.214
Even better.

21:38.214 --> 21:40.841
Spoken like a true Noshimuri.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.471
The name.

21:48.098 --> 21:50.309
And you'll go to your grave
with one less debt unpaid.

21:52.686 --> 21:55.439
There's a guard.
Kyle Cooper.

21:55.439 --> 21:57.775
He was her back channel.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.031
Thank you, Mr. Kojima.

22:06.492 --> 22:07.660
So it's true?

22:09.411 --> 22:12.164
You really are working
with Five-O now?

22:12.164 --> 22:13.707
That's right.

22:13.707 --> 22:18.128
If he could see you now.
(chuckles)

22:21.131 --> 22:22.758
(lock buzzes)

22:22.758 --> 22:25.010
Hey,

22:25.010 --> 22:26.095
I need to speak
to a guard

22:26.095 --> 22:27.888
named Kyle Cooper right now.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.890
Right away.
(sighs)

22:29.890 --> 22:31.767
(computer beeps)

22:31.767 --> 22:33.561
Looks like he just
took an inmate off-site

22:33.561 --> 22:34.770
for emergency medical care.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.730
Let me guess, the prisoner's
name is Greer?

22:36.730 --> 22:38.023
Good guess.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.860
Gate open.

22:44.280 --> 22:45.948
You're gonna want to
call your supervisor.

22:45.948 --> 22:47.324
Right away, sir.

22:47.324 --> 22:48.617
Yeah, good.

22:52.037 --> 22:54.373
What's her name?

22:56.208 --> 22:58.085
Zahra.

22:58.085 --> 23:00.254
Zahra.

23:00.254 --> 23:04.300
Okay, Zahra.
Thank you.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.302
Love in the sunset
years of your life.

23:06.302 --> 23:07.511
Who would have thought?

23:07.511 --> 23:09.430
Where'd you meet her?

23:09.430 --> 23:13.267
Nairobi, where I've been living.
Uh-huh.

23:13.267 --> 23:14.310
She a civilian?

23:14.310 --> 23:16.353
(sighs heavily)
Pediatrician.

23:16.353 --> 23:18.522
Are these questions going to
come to an end eventually?

23:18.522 --> 23:21.025
How did you get
a beautiful doctor

23:21.025 --> 23:22.151
to be with you?

23:22.151 --> 23:24.737
Your guess is good as mine.
Uh-huh.

23:24.737 --> 23:27.990
Well, I'm happy for you.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.950
Why Nairobi, though?
Why'd you land there?

23:29.950 --> 23:32.244
Good people, strong coffee.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.996
Figured I'd spend some time
there when I hung it up.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.960
You haven't been
contracting, huh?

23:39.960 --> 23:43.255
No. A year as a prisoner
on a dirty cot

23:43.255 --> 23:45.633
gives you a lot of time to
reflect on losing a step.

23:48.927 --> 23:51.639
Plenty of sleepless nights
to realize that

23:51.639 --> 23:52.598
it's a younger man's game.

23:59.355 --> 24:02.024
Good to go. Time for Cole
to take overwatch.

24:09.490 --> 24:13.786
Ooh, that's a big gun.

24:13.786 --> 24:16.330
You still remember how
to hit with that thing, Cole?

24:16.330 --> 24:18.457
I'll tell you what,
when I'm in position,

24:18.457 --> 24:20.376
hang your ass out the window
and we'll see.

24:20.376 --> 24:21.585
Comm check.

24:21.585 --> 24:23.545
Good check.
All good.

24:26.715 --> 24:27.758
COLE:
Just like old times.

24:27.758 --> 24:29.259
JOE:
Hoo-yah!

24:29.259 --> 24:30.219
Get 'em, buddy.

24:34.431 --> 24:36.350
Steve, don't wait.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.897
What?

24:41.897 --> 24:45.442
Don't wait as long as I did
to find someone.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.695
I sat out too long.

24:47.695 --> 24:52.116
I don't want that
to happen to you.

24:54.618 --> 24:56.036
COLE:
I hate to interrupt, gentlemen,

24:56.036 --> 24:58.247
but I'm fairly sure
our company has arrived.

25:03.961 --> 25:05.337
No visual.
What's their position?

25:10.008 --> 25:11.176
I have it.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.511
And we have you.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.138
We'll cover.
All right.

25:14.138 --> 25:15.472
On three,

25:15.472 --> 25:17.599
two...

25:17.599 --> 25:18.809
one!

25:18.809 --> 25:20.728
(gunfire)

25:28.485 --> 25:29.820
Got him.

25:32.906 --> 25:34.324
Good. How's the cover?

25:34.324 --> 25:36.368
Pushing back.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.536
JOE:
Stay low.

25:37.536 --> 25:38.912
Move.

25:54.219 --> 25:55.804
(cries out)
Cole's hit!

26:01.894 --> 26:04.605
(gunfire)
(cries out)

26:04.605 --> 26:06.273
I'm going out there.

26:06.273 --> 26:07.399
I'll cover. Go, go, go.

26:09.318 --> 26:10.319
(groaning)

26:13.572 --> 26:14.198
JOE:
Steve. Steve!

26:24.750 --> 26:26.001
(echoing):
Cole.

26:29.963 --> 26:31.465
(grunts)

26:34.551 --> 26:36.428
Cole!

26:36.428 --> 26:38.889
We lost him.

26:38.889 --> 26:40.265
We gonna bring him home, Joe?

26:40.265 --> 26:42.392
And we're gonna scatter
his ashes on Narragansett Bay,

26:42.392 --> 26:44.102
like he would want.
Now move your ass!

26:45.729 --> 26:47.523
Moving.

26:53.654 --> 26:55.697
All right, thanks, buddy.
Keep me updated.

26:55.697 --> 26:59.618
Okay, so Adam's working
with the FBI, CHP

26:59.618 --> 27:01.495
and state police
to track down Greer.

27:01.495 --> 27:03.831
Right now, they're blanketing
the region of Victorville.

27:03.831 --> 27:04.998
That's one heavy blanket.

27:04.998 --> 27:06.166
Yeah.
Hi.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.125
How's our friend
enjoying rendition?

27:07.125 --> 27:08.418
He is not.

27:08.418 --> 27:10.045
But he's getting
a pretty good idea

27:10.045 --> 27:13.173
about how life's gonna
be for him in solitary.

27:13.173 --> 27:15.300
Well, speaking of prison,
I looked into that

27:15.300 --> 27:17.261
scumbag guard Cooper.

27:17.261 --> 27:20.764
It looks like he was
recently given 100K

27:20.764 --> 27:22.057
from a shell corporation
in Denmark.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.267
Great. I like it.

27:23.267 --> 27:24.268
Well, it gets better.

27:24.268 --> 27:25.686
That same shell

27:25.686 --> 27:28.856
also paid Bauer,
McGarrett's kitchen attacker,

27:28.856 --> 27:30.440
and the account was not
under his name,

27:30.440 --> 27:33.151
but I was able to link it
to his social security number.

27:33.151 --> 27:34.444
Okay, now I love it.

27:34.444 --> 27:35.863
Okay, so it's gonna
take a minute to find out

27:35.863 --> 27:37.865
who is behind
the shell corporation, but...

27:37.865 --> 27:39.116
we're closer to ID'ing

27:39.116 --> 27:41.243
who hired the guns.
Good work.
Okay,

27:41.243 --> 27:42.286
well, hold on, gentlemen,
hold your horses.

27:42.286 --> 27:43.871
I'm not done yet.
I did find

27:43.871 --> 27:45.581
one more thing
in Bauer's financials.

27:45.581 --> 27:48.834
There is a woman listed
on the account with him.

27:48.834 --> 27:51.128
Now, Bauer has
zero online presence.

27:51.128 --> 27:52.796
The guy is a ghost.

27:52.796 --> 27:55.507
But this woman, she has
a private social media page

27:55.507 --> 27:57.342
with a very public
profile picture.

27:57.342 --> 27:58.594
Behold.

27:59.970 --> 28:02.806
Tani, send this picture
to my phone.

28:02.806 --> 28:05.058
This silent act of his
is over now.

28:05.058 --> 28:06.518
I'm gonna have him singing.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.270
Joon, come on.

28:08.270 --> 28:09.938
(lock buzzes)

28:23.118 --> 28:24.661
(lock buzzes)

28:26.121 --> 28:28.081
GROVER:
Look at that little fella.

28:28.081 --> 28:31.919
(chuckles):
He looks so happy.

28:31.919 --> 28:33.337
Yeah, smiling in the park
with his mom.

28:33.337 --> 28:35.631
But you know what I think?

28:35.631 --> 28:37.215
He'd have been even happier...

28:37.215 --> 28:40.218
(German accent):
...with his papa.

28:40.218 --> 28:42.012
(sighs)

28:42.012 --> 28:44.222
I know exactly what
you're going through, man,

28:44.222 --> 28:46.058
in your head right now.

28:46.058 --> 28:49.311
I got a boy of my own.

28:49.311 --> 28:50.979
Not a decent father
in the world

28:50.979 --> 28:54.608
doesn't have a soft spot
in his heart for his son.

28:56.234 --> 29:01.907
Even if he can't really,
you know, put it into words.

29:01.907 --> 29:04.910
Tell you what there, Papa.

29:04.910 --> 29:07.162
I got a proposition for you.

29:07.162 --> 29:09.539
You're going to prison,
you know.

29:09.539 --> 29:12.209
You ain't getting out of that.

29:12.209 --> 29:14.795
But what if I was to tell you

29:14.795 --> 29:17.714
that I would do
everything in my power

29:17.714 --> 29:20.509
to make sure that you
do your bid

29:20.509 --> 29:22.552
in...

29:22.552 --> 29:25.222
Deutschland,

29:25.222 --> 29:28.684
instead of here in
these United States?

29:31.228 --> 29:35.816
At least then you could
see your little boy.

29:35.816 --> 29:37.651
Visitation.

29:43.365 --> 29:45.993
I tell you, that's
some good-looking kid.

29:45.993 --> 29:47.953
I'm sorry, man.
I owe you an apology.

29:47.953 --> 29:50.914
I've been very rude.

29:50.914 --> 29:52.958
I'm here talking
about your son,

29:52.958 --> 29:55.127
I haven't even
asked you his name.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.962
What do you call him?

30:01.383 --> 30:05.387
I don't know who paid for this.

30:05.387 --> 30:07.139
I only know the lawyer.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.390
What lawyer?

30:08.390 --> 30:10.100
In Copenhagen.

30:10.100 --> 30:13.520
The contact person
who set everything up.

30:13.520 --> 30:16.648
He was the only one I spoke to.

30:19.026 --> 30:20.444
What's his name?

30:23.572 --> 30:26.324
Thomsen.

30:26.324 --> 30:28.660
Gregers Thomsen.

30:35.792 --> 30:37.419
Four down, seven left.

30:37.419 --> 30:39.004
(cries out)

30:40.255 --> 30:41.381
Make that six.

30:49.806 --> 30:51.516
Remote's down.

30:51.516 --> 30:54.061
And I got to reload.

30:54.061 --> 30:55.520
I got to hit this cap
to get it to go.

30:59.691 --> 31:00.776
(cries out)

31:05.072 --> 31:06.073
Five.

31:06.073 --> 31:07.407
They're all past
the mines now, Joe.

31:07.407 --> 31:09.367
We got five coming in the front.

31:12.162 --> 31:13.789
Let's see if I can cut
that number.

31:17.626 --> 31:21.171
Joe? RPG! RPG! Incoming!

31:30.305 --> 31:30.972
(cries out)

31:39.898 --> 31:41.066
(grunts)

31:51.326 --> 31:53.745
(grunts)

31:53.745 --> 31:54.996
I got two left.

31:54.996 --> 31:56.665
One incoming
from the north side.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.216
(groans)

32:07.551 --> 32:09.136
Oh!

32:11.221 --> 32:12.305
(groans)

32:26.486 --> 32:28.029
Joe, you hit?

32:28.029 --> 32:30.031
It's nothing.

32:30.031 --> 32:31.741
All right. Move it.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.342
(grunting)

32:53.597 --> 32:55.515
(panting)

33:00.228 --> 33:01.479
How bad is it?
Through-and-through?

33:01.479 --> 33:04.816
No, but I've seen worse.

33:04.816 --> 33:07.736
Keep the pressure on it, Joe.

33:07.736 --> 33:09.613
All right?
You'll be all right.

33:09.613 --> 33:11.823
(phone dialing)

33:11.823 --> 33:14.743
Lou.
GROVER: Thank God.
Where the hell are you?

33:14.743 --> 33:17.329
Bitterroot Valley, Montana.
I just dropped you a pin.

33:17.329 --> 33:19.456
Listen, Joe's hurt. GSW.

33:19.456 --> 33:21.416
I need a medevac out here
right now.
I'm on it.

33:21.416 --> 33:23.376
Look, Steve, I'm just gonna
give it to you straight.

33:23.376 --> 33:25.503
Greer escaped.
What?

33:25.503 --> 33:26.838
Adam's with the California
authorities now,

33:26.838 --> 33:28.006
they're trying to find her.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.966
In the meantime, we
have some good news.

33:29.966 --> 33:32.010
We found your hitter
from this morning.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.221
He gave us the name of
a lawyer from Denmark

33:34.221 --> 33:36.598
who set everything up
for his very rich client.

33:36.598 --> 33:38.850
Couple minutes before you
called, we ID'd that client.

33:38.850 --> 33:42.270
His name is Omar Hassan.

33:42.270 --> 33:44.314
STEVE:
Target is down, I repeat:

33:44.314 --> 33:45.982
target and guards are down.

33:45.982 --> 33:47.651
Oh, oh, oh!

33:47.651 --> 33:49.152
Whoa-whoa, whoa!

34:27.190 --> 34:29.150
Omar.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.068
(softly):
Omar.

34:53.258 --> 34:55.760
Omar Hassan is the son
of the high-value target

34:55.760 --> 34:59.097
we took out on that
operation in Rabat, 2002.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.057
He was about ten years old then.

35:01.057 --> 35:03.310
TANI:
Well, 16 years later,

35:03.310 --> 35:05.395
he runs a very successful
shipping company

35:05.395 --> 35:06.730
in Copenhagen.

35:06.730 --> 35:08.064
The guy doesn't
have any ties

35:08.064 --> 35:09.399
to terrorist groups,
he doesn't fund

35:09.399 --> 35:11.985
a single radical cause...
Got a cause of his own.

35:11.985 --> 35:14.112
Revenge.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.905
If I could go back,
same hallway,

35:15.905 --> 35:18.325
same kid, same gun,
I'd make the same call.

35:20.160 --> 35:22.120
What do you got?
Medevac is 90
minutes out.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.788
Copy that.

35:23.788 --> 35:25.874
I'll call you back.

35:27.417 --> 35:29.085
Where's the nearest clinic?

35:29.085 --> 35:31.671
I'll drive 130 if I have to.

35:47.854 --> 35:50.231
(exhales)
Cars are all shot to hell.

35:50.231 --> 35:51.399
Yeah. I was afraid of that.

35:51.399 --> 35:53.568
We have another play.
What's that?

35:53.568 --> 35:55.737
Another one of my neighbors,
three miles across the valley,

35:55.737 --> 35:56.905
guy's a retired surgeon.

35:56.905 --> 35:58.656
STEVE: Oh, yeah?
How we gonna get there?

35:58.656 --> 36:00.367
JOE: If my memory serves,
we drove right past some

36:00.367 --> 36:01.951
perfectly good horses.

36:01.951 --> 36:03.661
I don't think Dexter would mind
if we took a couple

36:03.661 --> 36:05.330
out for a spin.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.916
You rode plenty
in Afghanistan.
Say no more.

36:07.916 --> 36:09.626
JOE: I'll give
the old sawbones a call.

36:09.626 --> 36:11.461
Tell him we're on our way.
STEVE: Yeah, and listen,

36:11.461 --> 36:13.296
you call Junior, too,
all right?

36:13.296 --> 36:14.506
You have him reroute
that medevac

36:14.506 --> 36:16.007
to the doctor's ranch.
JOE: Copy.

36:29.938 --> 36:32.649
♪ ♪

36:49.499 --> 36:51.167
♪ ♪

37:09.644 --> 37:11.312
(breathing heavily)

37:22.240 --> 37:23.241
Stop.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.285
What?
I said stop.

37:25.285 --> 37:27.537
Whoa. Whoa!

37:27.537 --> 37:29.539
(panting):
We're here.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.835
What do you mean, we're here?

37:33.835 --> 37:36.212
We're here, I said.

37:36.212 --> 37:37.130
(groans)

37:38.506 --> 37:39.924
Here, where? What are you...?

37:45.930 --> 37:48.516
Joe, the doctor's ranch has got
to be at least two miles away.

37:48.516 --> 37:50.185
(both panting)

37:50.185 --> 37:52.937
Hey, I'm talking to you.

37:52.937 --> 37:54.022
Hey.

37:59.402 --> 38:02.155
I'm sorry.
(exhales)

38:02.155 --> 38:03.531
Damn it, Joe, no.

38:03.531 --> 38:04.949
No, Joe, no.

38:10.371 --> 38:12.373
There's no doctor, is there?

38:12.373 --> 38:14.417
You didn't make
any calls, did you?

38:14.417 --> 38:15.919
I made one.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.255
I called off the medevac.
No!

38:21.549 --> 38:25.011
What's the matter with you?!
Get back on the horse.

38:25.011 --> 38:26.679
Come on.
No, it's-it's
useless, Steve.

38:26.679 --> 38:29.182
What are you talking about?
What, are you gonna give up?

38:29.182 --> 38:30.808
That's not you.
It's not what you do.

38:30.808 --> 38:32.644
That's not us.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.062
Okay, you know what?

38:34.062 --> 38:35.313
You-you know what?
S-Steve...

38:35.313 --> 38:37.065
I'm gonna get that medevac
back in the air, okay?

38:37.065 --> 38:38.483
You're not gonna fight,
I'll fight.

38:38.483 --> 38:39.817
All right? I'll fight!
No, I'm not gonna

38:39.817 --> 38:42.237
use those resources when
it's useless for me.

38:42.237 --> 38:44.239
Stop saying it, Joe.
Don't say it.

38:44.239 --> 38:46.533
Steve, Steve...
(groans)

38:46.533 --> 38:48.284
My liver is hit.

38:48.284 --> 38:49.953
Bullet's still in there
raising holy hell.

38:49.953 --> 38:52.330
(groans)

38:52.330 --> 38:54.165
Joe? Joe. Joe, Joe.

38:54.165 --> 38:55.458
Joe, look at me.
Look at me, look at me.

38:55.458 --> 38:56.751
Please get back
on the horse.

38:56.751 --> 38:58.878
Okay? Please.
I-I mean, it's...

38:58.878 --> 39:01.464
There's got to be somewhere we
can ride; I mean, let's go now.

39:01.464 --> 39:03.925
We'll go now.
No, it's all
right, Steve.

39:03.925 --> 39:05.426
I didn't want
to lie to you.

39:05.426 --> 39:06.844
But I wanted to see
this place again.

39:08.888 --> 39:10.181
You gonna give me
a hand or what?

39:10.181 --> 39:12.725
(both panting)

39:12.725 --> 39:14.060
Come here.
(grunts)

39:14.060 --> 39:15.311
Come here.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.233
STEVE (softly):
Good job.

39:20.233 --> 39:22.360
Oh, I got you.
I got you, Joe.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.363
All right. Okay.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.115
(both panting)

39:27.115 --> 39:29.367
Yeah.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.244
(sighs)

39:39.043 --> 39:40.336
(groans, sighs)

39:50.013 --> 39:52.181
(grunts)

39:52.181 --> 39:54.517
There's something I
never thanked you for.

39:54.517 --> 39:56.102
Joe, I never thanked...

39:56.102 --> 39:57.729
There's something...
Yeah?

40:00.356 --> 40:02.317
I never thanked
you for Carlsbad.

40:02.317 --> 40:03.985
Carlsbad?

40:03.985 --> 40:05.528
What are you
talking about?

40:06.946 --> 40:08.406
My first week in
military school,

40:08.406 --> 40:09.866
when I stole that car.

40:09.866 --> 40:13.661
Why would you go and do-do
a dumbass thing like that?

40:13.661 --> 40:15.747
Well, gee. I don't know.
I thought my mother was dead,

40:15.747 --> 40:17.832
my father just...
shipped me off

40:17.832 --> 40:20.168
like I was a parcel.

40:20.168 --> 40:22.420
I don't know, I just...

40:22.420 --> 40:25.632
I wanted to get the hell out
of there, get back to Hawaii

40:25.632 --> 40:27.842
any way I could.

40:27.842 --> 40:29.886
STEVE: You know? A 16-year-old
kid gets pulled over

40:29.886 --> 40:32.388
in a stolen car, you don't--
That doesn't just go away.

40:32.388 --> 40:34.432
You don't just walk away.

40:34.432 --> 40:36.976
I figured somebody made a call.

40:36.976 --> 40:38.853
Pretty sure
that was you, right?

40:38.853 --> 40:40.021
JOE:
Now that you mention it,

40:40.021 --> 40:41.856
it does sound familiar.

40:41.856 --> 40:43.107
Your mother had people
watching you.

40:44.567 --> 40:46.069
When she got word
of the arrest,

40:46.069 --> 40:46.944
she reached out to me.

40:46.944 --> 40:49.947
Called in a few favors.

40:49.947 --> 40:53.534
I was-I was happy
to do it.

40:53.534 --> 40:55.453
Yeah, well.

40:58.790 --> 41:02.543
That night...

41:02.543 --> 41:05.463
changed the course
of my life, Joe.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.923
If I hadn't have gotten
off with that warning,

41:06.923 --> 41:08.841
I-I never would have
gone on to the SEALs.

41:08.841 --> 41:10.426
To Five-O.

41:13.554 --> 41:16.516
I realized that night that
somebody believed in me.

41:16.516 --> 41:19.060
Even though I'd given up
believing in myself.

41:19.060 --> 41:20.561
That's it.

41:20.561 --> 41:24.148
That's what I had
to thank you for.

41:24.148 --> 41:27.527
Have you lost
your mind, son?

41:27.527 --> 41:31.781
You've thanked me
every day since

41:31.781 --> 41:33.157
with the man
you've become.

41:33.157 --> 41:36.327
With the work
you've done.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.955
Don't you see that...
Joe, I got you.

41:38.955 --> 41:41.040
I got you.
(grunts)

41:41.040 --> 41:42.917
I got you. I got you.

41:42.917 --> 41:45.503
Listen. Listen...

41:45.503 --> 41:50.091
The way I...
looked out for you,

41:50.091 --> 41:52.719
that's the way
that you...

41:52.719 --> 41:54.762
watch over the people
in your life now.

41:56.556 --> 41:59.142
I couldn't be prouder

41:59.142 --> 42:02.061
of the man you've become.

42:07.650 --> 42:09.235
We're gonna get him, Joe.
You know that, right?

42:09.235 --> 42:11.362
Of that I have no doubt.

42:14.240 --> 42:17.618
I just have...
one more question, Steve.

42:19.787 --> 42:21.622
Anything.

42:21.622 --> 42:23.249
Anything, Joe.

42:24.834 --> 42:27.420
Have you ever in your life...

42:29.881 --> 42:33.217
...seen a sunset like that?

42:36.846 --> 42:38.765
(sniffles)

42:41.267 --> 42:43.978
No, Joe, I...

42:43.978 --> 42:45.813
I haven't.

42:45.813 --> 42:49.108
No, I haven't, Joe.

42:49.108 --> 42:52.195
