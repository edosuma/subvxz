21:59.579 --> 22:02.321
She also found traces
of sedatives and opioids.

22:02.364 --> 22:04.845
[phone chimes]So this woman was drugged.

22:04.888 --> 22:06.194
They all were.

22:06.237 --> 22:07.500
Wait, w-what do you mean, "all"?

22:07.543 --> 22:09.023
She found four separate
DNA profiles

22:09.066 --> 22:10.198
on the blanket.

22:10.241 --> 22:11.373
All women, all drugged.

22:11.417 --> 22:13.288
So the woman Maui and Penna saw

22:13.332 --> 22:14.550
was only one of four?

22:14.594 --> 22:15.943
We have to call Katsumoto.

22:15.986 --> 22:17.510
That's more than enough
evidence to arrest him.

22:17.553 --> 22:18.728
Yes, it is, but...

22:18.772 --> 22:19.816
Why is there always a but?

22:19.860 --> 22:21.209
Just hear me out, all right?

22:21.252 --> 22:22.819
It's gonna take a while
for HPD to get here.

22:22.863 --> 22:24.691
We have no idea
where the professor's headed.

22:24.734 --> 22:27.302
We got to pull him over and
detain him until HPD gets there.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.391
We can't afford
to lose this guy.

22:29.435 --> 22:30.697
Point taken.

22:30.740 --> 22:32.046
[tires screeching]

22:40.097 --> 22:41.751
Okay, how do you propose
we pull him over?

22:41.795 --> 22:43.492
Easy peasy.

22:43.536 --> 22:44.667
Easy peasy?

22:44.711 --> 22:46.887
[engine revs]

22:46.930 --> 22:49.498
[horn honks]

22:56.679 --> 22:58.028
MAGNUM: See? Easy peasy.

23:02.555 --> 23:05.079
What do you think you're doing?
Ow!

23:05.122 --> 23:06.602
Restraining you.

23:06.646 --> 23:08.125
Quite easily, I might add.

23:09.692 --> 23:10.737
KATSUMOTO:
Yeah?

23:10.780 --> 23:12.391
There was blood on the blanket.

23:12.434 --> 23:15.089
DNA showed us from four
different women, All of which

23:15.132 --> 23:16.133
had been drugged.

23:16.177 --> 23:17.265
That's enough to pick him up.

23:17.308 --> 23:18.745
Well, that's good,

23:18.788 --> 23:19.876
because we already got him.

23:19.920 --> 23:21.356
You disobeyed an order.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.444
You just said it was enough
to pick him up.

23:22.488 --> 23:24.403
The way I see it
is we just obeyed

23:24.446 --> 23:25.708
the order before you gave it.

23:27.144 --> 23:28.450
Just send me your location,
don't let him

23:28.494 --> 23:29.712
out of your sight
until we arrive.

23:29.756 --> 23:31.148
Copy that.

23:32.280 --> 23:34.108
HIGGINS:
These scratches on
your face look fresh.

23:34.978 --> 23:36.023
Care to explain them?

23:36.066 --> 23:37.067
Not unless you care to tell me

23:37.111 --> 23:38.155
what this is all about.

23:38.199 --> 23:39.200
We're private investigators.

23:39.243 --> 23:40.680
And I'm guessing those scratches

23:40.723 --> 23:41.985
came from one of the women
you abducted.

23:42.029 --> 23:44.553
Abducted?

23:44.597 --> 23:46.555
You've got it all wrong.

23:46.599 --> 23:48.470
[thudding]

23:49.732 --> 23:51.995
[muffled grunting]

23:55.346 --> 23:56.870
Hey, hey. Hey,
it's okay.

23:56.913 --> 23:59.307
It's okay, it's
okay. Calm down.

23:59.350 --> 24:01.396
I'm here to help.

24:02.179 --> 24:03.703
It's okay.

24:04.660 --> 24:05.661
Watch your head.

24:05.705 --> 24:08.359
[wheezing]Careful. It's all right.

24:09.535 --> 24:11.406
Easy, easy.

24:13.190 --> 24:14.496
You were saying?

24:28.162 --> 24:29.816
HPD should be here any minute.

24:29.859 --> 24:31.818
Okay.How is she doing?

24:31.861 --> 24:34.211
Well, she's calmer.

24:34.255 --> 24:35.865
Have any idea what
language she speaks?

24:35.909 --> 24:37.563
I don't speak it, but
it sounds Vietnamese.

24:37.606 --> 24:39.173
BAR:
It is.

24:39.216 --> 24:40.522
MAGNUM:
Oh, now you're trying
to be helpful?

24:40.566 --> 24:42.002
Depends on what
you're investigating.

24:42.045 --> 24:43.569
We're investigating
a potential murderer

24:43.612 --> 24:44.700
in your neighborhood.

24:44.744 --> 24:46.659
You think I'm a murderer?

24:46.702 --> 24:48.530
MAGNUM:
For somebody driving around

24:48.574 --> 24:50.967
with a woman in his trunk,
y-you seem pretty shocked.

24:51.011 --> 24:52.012
I wasn't gonna kill her.
I was trying to save her.

24:52.055 --> 24:54.623
Save her?
From what?

24:55.842 --> 24:58.105
She was trafficked to the island
and being held as a sex worker.

24:58.148 --> 25:00.499
What about the
other three women?

25:01.500 --> 25:03.502
H-How could you possibly
know about...

25:03.545 --> 25:04.981
We have our ways.

25:05.025 --> 25:07.375
They were all forced
into prostitution.

25:07.418 --> 25:08.985
She's the first one
I've been able to free

25:09.029 --> 25:10.857
from their safe house.

25:10.900 --> 25:14.251
The others I got back
by posing as a john.

25:14.295 --> 25:16.210
I used prepaid cells
to set up appointments,

25:16.253 --> 25:19.692
we'd meet at motels,
then I'd help them escape.

25:19.735 --> 25:22.346
So by day you're a professor,

25:22.390 --> 25:25.698
by night you're some kind
of hero, like Indiana Jones?

25:25.741 --> 25:28.135
I was just looking
into trafficking on the island.

25:28.178 --> 25:30.311
But once I saw what I saw,

25:30.354 --> 25:32.661
I couldn't just
write a paper on it.

25:32.705 --> 25:34.228
If you're trying to help
these girls, how do you explain

25:34.271 --> 25:36.491
the scratches
all over your face?

25:36.535 --> 25:37.710
She didn't know who I was.

25:37.753 --> 25:40.147
She was drugged,
disoriented and panicked.

25:40.190 --> 25:41.757
Same way she reacted
when you opened the trunk.

25:41.801 --> 25:43.803
Okay.

25:43.846 --> 25:45.195
If what you're saying is true,

25:45.239 --> 25:46.719
why didn't you just
go to the cops?

25:46.762 --> 25:49.896
I couldn't. I already
have a record for solicitation

25:49.939 --> 25:52.072
after being caught
posing as a john.

25:52.115 --> 25:54.901
They'd never believe me.

25:54.944 --> 25:57.338
I know, it sounds crazy.

25:57.381 --> 25:59.558
And the only person who
can verify your story

25:59.601 --> 26:01.168
speaks a language that we don't.

26:01.211 --> 26:02.996
I guess if we want
to hear her side of it,

26:03.039 --> 26:04.345
we need somebody
who speaks Vietnamese.

26:04.388 --> 26:05.564
Yep.

26:06.956 --> 26:09.306
[siren chirps]

26:11.439 --> 26:12.962
It's okay.

26:17.227 --> 26:19.534
UNI:
Thank you.
We'll take it from here.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.623
It's okay.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.059
She's scared.

26:23.103 --> 26:26.193
It's okay.
You're safe.

26:29.892 --> 26:31.590
You're on the right track.

26:31.633 --> 26:34.157
Find a translator.
You'll see my story checks out.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.779
Jin.
What are you doing here?

26:46.822 --> 26:50.086
Oh, Oleen, y-you live here?
What a coincidence.

26:50.130 --> 26:52.219
I was just going door-to-door
selling Tupperware and...

26:52.262 --> 26:54.264
That's what
my last stalker said.

26:54.308 --> 26:56.136
You wish you had a stalker
as cute as me.

26:56.179 --> 26:57.790
Seriously, how'd you find me?

26:57.833 --> 27:01.576
Oh, well, you left this in
the dryer at the Fluff 'n Fold

27:01.620 --> 27:03.230
and it looked like it was
a part of your uniform

27:03.273 --> 27:04.753
so I tracked you down.

27:04.797 --> 27:07.756
You tracked me down and came
all this way to return a sock?

27:07.800 --> 27:09.845
That's absolutely moronic.

27:09.889 --> 27:11.673
I know, but I was worried

27:11.717 --> 27:13.675
that they were gonna
take it out of your salary.

27:13.719 --> 27:15.808
They actually would've.

27:15.851 --> 27:17.897
It's only 11 bucks, but...

27:17.940 --> 27:19.725
these days, every dollar counts.

27:19.768 --> 27:21.509
Thank you.

27:21.552 --> 27:23.163
GIRL:
Tutu!

27:23.206 --> 27:25.252
Ah, that's Lena,
my granddaughter.

27:25.295 --> 27:27.341
She's ten.My bad. Am I interrupting?

27:27.384 --> 27:29.822
No, no, no, it's fine.
Lena's mother is in rehab,

27:29.865 --> 27:31.780
so she's staying with me.

27:31.824 --> 27:34.609
So you're raising
a ten-year-old?

27:34.653 --> 27:38.352
On my own, while working
at the Palm Royal.

27:38.395 --> 27:42.051
Not gonna lie,
it's been tough.

27:42.095 --> 27:44.706
But when family's in need,
you press pause

27:44.750 --> 27:47.927
on your life to get theirs
back on track.

27:47.970 --> 27:50.277
Yeah.
I can relate.

27:50.320 --> 27:53.149
Really?
How many grandkids do you have?

27:53.193 --> 27:54.673
Seven.[both laugh]

27:54.716 --> 27:57.632
No, but, uh, I did grow
up with younger sisters

27:57.676 --> 28:00.548
and my parents
weren't around, so...

28:00.591 --> 28:04.421
I did what I had to and, uh,
made sure that they were okay.

28:05.292 --> 28:06.728
LENA:
Tutu!

28:06.772 --> 28:08.730
I got to get going.

28:08.774 --> 28:10.427
But thanks
for coming all this way.

28:10.471 --> 28:11.733
Of course.

28:11.777 --> 28:13.169
And if you ever need anything,
I-I'll be...

28:13.213 --> 28:16.433
This is the hand
I've been dealt.

28:17.565 --> 28:19.045
But thank you.

28:19.088 --> 28:21.308
Yeah. Of course.

28:31.100 --> 28:33.059
[speaking Vietnamese]

28:33.102 --> 28:34.756
Her name is Minh.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.410
Minh. Good.

28:36.453 --> 28:39.065
Can you ask her why
she was in the trunk?

28:39.108 --> 28:41.284
[speaking Vietnamese]

28:44.026 --> 28:45.114
She was hiding.

28:45.158 --> 28:47.334
Hiding from who?

28:51.120 --> 28:53.557
She was hiding
from the bad men.

28:53.601 --> 28:54.994
Bad men?

28:55.037 --> 28:58.084
Like the man who was driving
the car that you were in?

28:58.127 --> 29:00.347
[speaking Vietnamese]

29:03.742 --> 29:05.482
No. He saved her.

29:07.397 --> 29:09.399
Guess he really is
Indiana Jones.

29:12.489 --> 29:14.187
Yeah, bring in Professor Bar.

29:15.797 --> 29:17.277
Yep.

29:18.974 --> 29:20.802
Now, I know it's difficult,

29:20.846 --> 29:22.717
but if she could
tell us anything

29:22.761 --> 29:25.546
about what she experienced,
it could be helpful.

29:26.329 --> 29:28.592
[speaking Vietnamese]

29:38.646 --> 29:39.995
She came from Vietnam

29:40.039 --> 29:41.301
on a work visa...

29:43.869 --> 29:45.131
...with the promise of a job.

29:45.174 --> 29:46.785
[Minh continues speaking]

29:46.828 --> 29:48.482
But when she arrived...

29:50.223 --> 29:53.313
...she realized
that she was a prisoner,

29:53.356 --> 29:55.663
forced into a life
of prostitution.

29:55.706 --> 29:57.534
[Minh crying]

30:02.496 --> 30:04.628
She would still be locked at...

30:04.672 --> 30:06.326
in "scary house"

30:06.369 --> 30:08.067
if the man hadn't saved her.

30:08.110 --> 30:10.025

Does she remember

30:10.069 --> 30:12.201
the location of the scary house?

30:14.203 --> 30:16.466
[speaking Vietnamese]

30:19.905 --> 30:23.386
No.
She's not from here...

30:24.387 --> 30:26.650
...and she was drugged.

30:31.046 --> 30:32.439
Her name is Minh.

30:32.482 --> 30:34.528
She confirmed your story.

30:34.571 --> 30:36.182
We believe you.

30:38.749 --> 30:40.926
Professor.

30:40.969 --> 30:43.319
Where was she held, exactly?

30:43.363 --> 30:44.886
I have the address in my phone.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.627
It's an old campsite in Waialua.

30:46.670 --> 30:49.543
That's on the other side
of the island. We need to move.

30:49.586 --> 30:50.892
Yeah.

30:50.936 --> 30:53.199
[sirens wailing]

30:57.072 --> 30:59.248

Move! Go, go, go!

30:59.292 --> 31:00.815
Move in.
Go.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.599
Clear.

31:06.212 --> 31:07.735
Clear!

31:07.778 --> 31:10.564
All clear!

31:10.607 --> 31:12.392
Let's go.

31:15.264 --> 31:16.352
They're gone.

31:16.396 --> 31:17.745
When they realized
Minh was missing

31:17.788 --> 31:19.225
they probably got spooked.

31:19.268 --> 31:21.314
So the rest of the women...Could be anywhere by now.

31:26.972 --> 31:29.888
They left because I took Minh.Don't worry. We'll find them.

31:29.931 --> 31:31.977
Do you know where
they operated out of before

31:32.020 --> 31:33.630
this camp?No.

31:33.674 --> 31:35.676
But even if I did,
how would that help?

31:35.719 --> 31:37.417
If we knew their previous
locations, we might be able

31:37.460 --> 31:39.158
to form a pattern and figure out
where they may have gone.

31:39.201 --> 31:40.768
I learned about this place

31:40.811 --> 31:42.552
from the girls
I freed from the motel.

31:42.596 --> 31:44.119
But it's the only place I know.

31:44.163 --> 31:45.904
MAGNUM:
Those women that you freed--

31:45.947 --> 31:47.296
they could know something.

31:47.340 --> 31:48.950
Are any of them
still on the island?

31:48.994 --> 31:51.083
Uh, two of them returned home,
but one is still here

31:51.126 --> 31:53.868
at a nonprofit I work with,
The Freedom House.

31:55.478 --> 31:56.915
They help women
who've been trafficked.

31:56.958 --> 31:58.177
Okay, we need to head there.

32:03.182 --> 32:05.010
We good?Looks great.

32:05.053 --> 32:06.446
Thanks a lot, my man.

32:10.580 --> 32:13.583
Okay, so that's $900 for me...

32:14.367 --> 32:16.847
...and $100 for...

32:16.891 --> 32:18.762
the house.

32:18.806 --> 32:21.200
Jin, I've never
seen you look so down

32:21.243 --> 32:23.463
when holding so much cash
in your hand.

32:23.506 --> 32:25.465
Yeah, you okay, bro?

32:25.508 --> 32:27.684
Yeah. No, not really.

32:27.728 --> 32:29.686
I've been thinking about Oleen.

32:29.730 --> 32:31.906
