WEBVTT

00:00.732 --> 00:02.651
What was my best brush
with celebrity?

00:02.718 --> 00:05.369
Oh, this is such
a good one.

00:05.437 --> 00:07.606
One time I saw Jack Nicholson
at the car wash.

00:07.673 --> 00:09.107
I can't
go through this again.

00:09.158 --> 00:11.309
Jack Nicholson does not drive
a Hyundai Odyssey

00:11.377 --> 00:13.511
with a Co-Exist
bumper sticker, Cam.

00:13.829 --> 00:15.180
Being
in the closet business,

00:15.248 --> 00:16.848
I met
a lot of famous people.

00:16.915 --> 00:18.433
I can't name names,

00:18.500 --> 00:20.502
but let's just say it's someone
who's the boss.

00:20.569 --> 00:21.870
You met
Bruce Springsteen?

00:21.938 --> 00:24.305
No, Tony Danza.
Oh, from the TV show?

00:24.390 --> 00:25.857
Nah, she was the boss.

00:25.925 --> 00:28.093
It's open
to interpretation.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.879
I saw Santa Claus
at the mall.

00:32.430 --> 00:35.100
"The Unwitting
Miss Castle."

00:35.167 --> 00:36.000
What's that about?

00:36.068 --> 00:37.752
It's about
three persecuted women

00:37.820 --> 00:39.153
in different time periods,

00:39.238 --> 00:41.522
or one time traveler
with incredibly bad luck.

00:41.607 --> 00:42.841
I don't know which.

00:42.908 --> 00:44.392
Somehow,
I was able to join

00:44.460 --> 00:45.894
a very exclusive book club

00:45.962 --> 00:48.162
filled with the most
intelligent women.

00:48.247 --> 00:50.198
I can never
seem to impress them.

00:50.265 --> 00:52.183
They use words like
"sanguine."

00:52.251 --> 00:54.419
I don't want to
look like an idiot,
so I use it, too.

00:54.487 --> 00:58.239
Isn't that the most
sanguine thing you ever heard?

00:58.307 --> 01:00.625
You're not
using it right.

01:00.693 --> 01:03.128
I've read
the same chapter eight times --

01:03.195 --> 01:04.144
still don't get it.

01:04.212 --> 01:06.648
Just say, "It holds a mirror
up to society."

01:06.715 --> 01:09.167
You'll get your "C"
and get out of there.

01:09.234 --> 01:10.785
Huh.

01:10.853 --> 01:12.787
Good morning.
Hi.

01:12.854 --> 01:14.472
Who's that
young thing?

01:14.540 --> 01:17.642
Wow, what's up
with the outfit,
Mod Squad?

01:17.709 --> 01:18.609
Oh, yeah, I'm, uh...

01:18.677 --> 01:19.761
I'm showing a house
to someone.

01:20.146 --> 01:20.878
Oh.

01:20.946 --> 01:22.114
I'd rather not say
who it is.

01:22.181 --> 01:23.047
I totally get that.

01:23.115 --> 01:25.083
It's Chris Martin
from Coldplay.

01:25.150 --> 01:27.485
Come on, really?
It's not a big deal.

01:27.552 --> 01:28.920
Says the man who spent
most of last night

01:28.987 --> 01:30.638
sewing that flower
onto his jeans.

01:30.706 --> 01:31.790
Okay,
it's a really big deal.

01:31.858 --> 01:32.990
I'm meeting the man
who sings how I feel.

01:33.058 --> 01:35.943
Yes, his music
is so sanguine.

01:36.011 --> 01:36.945
Eh, closer.

01:37.012 --> 01:38.813
Never been
a big Coldplay guy.

01:38.881 --> 01:40.982
I'm more into hip-hop,
death metal,

01:41.050 --> 01:42.417
"Little Mermaid."

01:42.468 --> 01:44.969
That one really
imprinted on me
back in the day.

01:45.037 --> 01:46.954
My stomach feels weird.

01:47.022 --> 01:48.523
You're probably
just nervous.

01:48.590 --> 01:50.241
Ooh, maybe you need someone
to come with you.

01:50.309 --> 01:52.260
No, he's there to buy a house,
not talk about music,

01:52.328 --> 01:53.328
which is why
I'm not even gonna mention

01:53.396 --> 01:54.596
that I'm a songwriter,
too.

01:54.663 --> 01:55.664
Oh,
you wrote one song.

01:55.731 --> 01:57.248
I said everything
I had to say.

01:57.316 --> 01:58.383
About a realtor.

01:58.451 --> 01:59.400
It was about life!

01:59.468 --> 02:02.437
This is why they mock you
at book club.

02:14.933 --> 02:16.250
Oh, here's a brush
with celebrity

02:16.318 --> 02:17.551
I can actually talk about.

02:17.619 --> 02:19.404
Last summer,
I was called upon

02:19.472 --> 02:22.256
to participate in the most
American of traditions --

02:22.324 --> 02:23.941
getting out of jury duty.

02:24.009 --> 02:27.111
Do you have any experience
with law enforcement?

02:27.179 --> 02:29.464
Big time.
I-I don't trust, uh, cops.

02:29.532 --> 02:31.899
Also,
I despise robbery victims.

02:31.967 --> 02:33.234
They're the real criminals

02:33.302 --> 02:34.669
for clogging up
our court system.

02:34.736 --> 02:36.020
Nice try, Juror 3.

02:36.088 --> 02:37.471
What about
economic hardship?

02:37.539 --> 02:38.990
The last time I missed work,

02:39.057 --> 02:41.393
the California closet market
collapsed.

02:41.460 --> 02:43.127
Some people think that
caused the L.A. riots.

02:45.030 --> 02:46.197
I must be done talking.

02:46.265 --> 02:47.916
I'm going into labor.

02:47.984 --> 02:49.950
Ma'am, Ma'am, everything's
gonna be all right.

02:50.018 --> 02:51.853
Bailiff, help Juror 11
with anything she needs,

02:51.920 --> 02:53.804
and bring in
the next alternate.

02:53.872 --> 02:55.656
Uh, as her Lamaze coach,

02:55.724 --> 02:57.475
I think I should probably
be out in the hall wi--

03:02.264 --> 03:03.247
Terry Bradshaw.

03:03.416 --> 03:04.949
I love Terry Bradshaw!

03:05.017 --> 03:07.936
Juror 11, is there anything
that might prevent you

03:08.003 --> 03:10.271
from serving effectively
on this jury?

03:10.339 --> 03:11.990
No scheduling conflicts,
Your Honor.

03:12.007 --> 03:14.626
However,
I am going through

03:14.693 --> 03:15.893
kind of a rough patch
right now.

03:15.961 --> 03:17.645
You see,
I lost my best friend.

03:17.713 --> 03:19.464
Or did he just find one?

03:19.531 --> 03:20.732
But I'm happy to serve.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.850
I believe in
the American legal system,

03:22.935 --> 03:24.853
and I believe
it's all about teamwork.

03:26.305 --> 03:28.673
That's a touchdown
of an answer, champ.

03:28.741 --> 03:30.257
Uh, this lady here...

03:30.325 --> 03:32.026
put me down for that.

03:32.094 --> 03:35.162
Are you ready
for some justice?

03:37.149 --> 03:38.283
Oh, my God.

03:38.350 --> 03:40.051
What? A celebrity?

03:40.119 --> 03:42.821
It's Sam Anvilmaker.
Who?

03:42.888 --> 03:44.339
He wrote "The Forgetters
and the Forgotten"?

03:44.407 --> 03:45.790
"Farce, American Style"?

03:45.858 --> 03:47.408
"Screw You
For Reading This"?

03:47.476 --> 03:48.709
What the hell
is happening?

03:48.777 --> 03:49.911
Yes, that one, too!

03:49.979 --> 03:51.896
He's my favorite
playwright.

03:51.964 --> 03:53.598
Why don't you go and
tell him that you're a fan?

03:53.666 --> 03:55.282
Maybe he can give you
some advice.

03:55.350 --> 03:57.485
No, no, I wouldn't want
to bother him.

03:57.553 --> 03:59.237
He's notoriously private.

03:59.305 --> 04:00.788
He writes
in a hollowed-out tree

04:00.856 --> 04:01.989
somewhere in Montana.

04:02.024 --> 04:03.308
Don't be nervous.

04:03.375 --> 04:04.792
It just doesn't
feel right.

04:04.860 --> 04:06.827
Manny, if somebody admired
my work as much as this,

04:06.895 --> 04:08.480
I would like to know.

04:09.465 --> 04:11.399
Go.
Okay.

04:11.467 --> 04:13.001
Here we go.

04:16.822 --> 04:19.857
Uh, excuse me,
Mr. Anvilmaker?
Let me guess --

04:19.925 --> 04:22.543
I'm the reason
you want to be a writer.

04:22.611 --> 04:23.661
Yeah, actually.

04:23.728 --> 04:25.546
Your first play changed
the way that I looked at --

04:25.614 --> 04:26.480
Listen, kid.

04:26.548 --> 04:28.066
I'm not here
to collect panties

04:28.133 --> 04:29.700
with phone numbers
on them.

04:29.835 --> 04:31.970
I'm here to experience
the cold absurdity

04:32.087 --> 04:34.005
that is being alive.

04:34.073 --> 04:37.808
So go and find someone else
to venerate.

04:37.843 --> 04:41.429
Oh, uh...
sorry for bothering you.

04:41.513 --> 04:42.580
Here's a writing tip --

04:42.647 --> 04:44.232
show me you're sorry
for bothering me.

04:44.299 --> 04:45.900
Don't tell me.

04:45.985 --> 04:47.418
Okay, let's take a picture

04:47.486 --> 04:48.620
of the two
new best friends.

04:48.688 --> 04:49.720
Come together.

04:49.788 --> 04:52.423
I should never
have left my tree.

04:52.491 --> 04:54.259
And then,
I saw Daniel Day-Lewis

04:54.326 --> 04:55.426
at our dry cleaner.

04:55.494 --> 04:57.996
Not him. No.

04:58.030 --> 04:59.697
Uh, the time
we actually saw a celebrity

04:59.765 --> 05:01.116
was last December

05:01.183 --> 05:02.833
when we were shopping
for gardening supplies.

05:02.901 --> 05:05.303
I'll never forget the feeling
of having Lincoln

05:05.305 --> 05:08.773
look directly into my eyes
and saying,

05:08.841 --> 05:13.194
"We couldn't get
the barbecue sauce out."

05:13.262 --> 05:14.662
We both don't need a pair.

05:14.729 --> 05:15.997
We can just share these.

05:16.064 --> 05:17.298
And what if I want my own?

05:17.383 --> 05:18.683
We share everything.

05:18.751 --> 05:19.951
We share a toothbrush.

05:20.019 --> 05:21.802
We do? Oh...
Oh, my -- Oh, my gosh.

05:21.804 --> 05:22.636
Hm?
There's the guy
who hosts

05:22.772 --> 05:24.204
that home makeover show
we love so much.

05:24.272 --> 05:25.290
What? Where?
It's Scott Hunter.

05:25.357 --> 05:26.991
Scott Hunter
is right over there.

05:27.142 --> 05:28.192
Every week, Scott Hunter,

05:28.260 --> 05:30.095
the host of
"I Beg Your Garden,"

05:30.162 --> 05:32.546
selects an unsuspecting couple
at a home store.

05:32.614 --> 05:35.333
Yeah, he taps them
on the shoulder and says,

05:35.401 --> 05:36.618
"I beg your garden."

05:36.685 --> 05:38.169
What?! Oh, my God!
I can't believe it!

05:38.236 --> 05:39.921
That's how it goes
every time.

05:39.988 --> 05:41.155
Every time.

05:41.240 --> 05:42.640
Where are the cameras?
I know.

05:42.708 --> 05:43.874
I wish I would've worn
something more colorful.

05:43.942 --> 05:45.076
Okay, you know what?

05:45.143 --> 05:46.393
We have to get
on the show.

05:46.461 --> 05:48.346
Can you imagine
a backyard makeover,

05:48.413 --> 05:49.998
what he would do
with ours?

05:50.082 --> 05:51.332
Yeah, one word,
three syllables,

05:51.400 --> 05:53.385
starts with "gah,"
ends with "zebo."

05:54.887 --> 05:55.669
Gazebo.

05:55.805 --> 05:57.471
I love gazebos.
I do, too!

05:57.506 --> 05:59.641
Now that I'm thinking
about it,
I have to have one.

05:59.708 --> 06:00.558
Oh, my gosh.
Wait, we work hard.

06:00.625 --> 06:01.926
We deserve
to stand in the shade

06:01.994 --> 06:03.110
a few inches
off the ground.
Yeah.

06:03.178 --> 06:04.429
Okay, you know what?

06:04.496 --> 06:05.764
Let's go get tapped.
Okay.

06:06.832 --> 06:08.900
Hm, what's over here?

06:08.967 --> 06:10.435
I don't know.

06:10.502 --> 06:11.536
Oh, my gosh, Mitchell,
do you like this planter?

06:11.604 --> 06:13.354
It would go great

06:13.421 --> 06:15.656
in our hopelessly outdated
and neglected backyard.

06:15.724 --> 06:17.659
I love it
if you love it.

06:17.726 --> 06:18.960
And what do you think
of these pavers?

06:19.028 --> 06:20.412
Oh, I think they go great
with that gazebo

06:20.479 --> 06:21.528
we've always
dreamed of having.

06:21.613 --> 06:22.747
Oh, forget it.
He's gone.

06:22.814 --> 06:25.500
W-What did we do wrong?
We were pleasant.

06:25.567 --> 06:27.502
You know what?
Maybe we were too nice.

06:27.569 --> 06:29.954
Couples on those shows
always have conflict.

06:30.021 --> 06:31.322
So do we.
Yeah.

06:31.390 --> 06:32.557
When's the last time
we agreed on anything.

06:32.625 --> 06:34.041
We -- We're constantly
bickering.

06:34.109 --> 06:36.060
I know, sometimes it reveals
something deeper,

06:36.128 --> 06:37.912
but not always.

06:37.963 --> 06:38.796
You know what?

06:38.931 --> 06:40.915
Let's go show him
our delightful brand

06:40.982 --> 06:42.283
of bitchy friction.

06:42.351 --> 06:44.369
I was thinking
the exact same thing.

06:44.436 --> 06:46.153
Stop seeing eye-to-eye
with me.
Sorry, sorry.

06:46.221 --> 06:47.772
Let's go find him
and drum up an argument.

06:47.839 --> 06:49.340
Yeah, terrific idea.

06:49.408 --> 06:50.441
I'm not doing it
on purpose.

06:50.509 --> 06:51.593
I'm just...

06:56.031 --> 06:56.864
Oh, ow.

06:56.932 --> 06:58.732
What is going on?

06:58.817 --> 07:01.018
My gro -- oy...oh!

07:01.070 --> 07:02.337
This was a nightmare.

07:02.404 --> 07:03.604
I was about to meet my hero,

07:03.672 --> 07:05.740
and I was experiencing
this bizarre pain in --

07:05.807 --> 07:08.576
in my...nether region.

07:08.661 --> 07:09.928
Wait, I'm a grown man.

07:09.995 --> 07:11.645
I should be able to say it --
my left bean bag --

07:11.713 --> 07:12.747
did it again.

07:12.814 --> 07:14.115
My tersticle --

07:14.182 --> 07:15.967
That's as close
as I think I'm gonna get.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.118
Hello?

07:17.120 --> 07:18.736
Hey, hey!

07:18.754 --> 07:21.456
Welcome, welcome,
welcome.

07:21.523 --> 07:22.757
Phil.
Hey, I'm Chris.

07:22.842 --> 07:23.957
Oh!
Hey, what's wrong?

07:24.042 --> 07:25.576
Oh, nothing.

07:25.594 --> 07:27.645
You thought
I'd be better looking.

07:27.712 --> 07:29.497
People think that
because the rest of the band

07:29.565 --> 07:30.932
look like hobbits.
No, no, no.

07:30.999 --> 07:32.300
It's -- It's a little --
Hey.

07:32.367 --> 07:33.635
I love
your flower jeans.
Oh.

07:33.702 --> 07:34.835
Where did you get those?

07:34.903 --> 07:36.604
They're from a store.

07:36.671 --> 07:38.556
Well, they're very me.
They're very me.

07:38.691 --> 07:40.041
Do you remember
the name of the store?

07:40.108 --> 07:41.826
Actually,
I embroidered them myself.

07:41.893 --> 07:43.210
Impressive.

07:43.278 --> 07:44.779
When you're ready for it,

07:44.781 --> 07:45.713
you get a T-shirt,

07:45.780 --> 07:47.481
you put it on top of
a long-sleeve,

07:47.549 --> 07:50.451
then it lets everybody know
you own multiple shirts.

07:50.519 --> 07:51.819
Impressive.

07:51.954 --> 07:55.673
So, mate, shall
we have a trod-a-bout?

07:55.740 --> 07:56.774
I'm flattered.

07:56.841 --> 07:58.275
I'd rather just keep it
professional,

07:58.343 --> 07:59.560
have a walk around.

07:59.627 --> 08:01.529
Oh, that's not what...Oi...

08:08.370 --> 08:10.003
Terry was just
sitting there by himself

08:10.088 --> 08:11.522
because everybody's
always afraid

08:11.590 --> 08:12.890
to talk
to the prettiest girl,

08:12.958 --> 08:14.408
except this guy.

08:14.476 --> 08:16.311
It's all about confidence.

08:16.378 --> 08:17.661
Excuse me, Mr. --

08:18.864 --> 08:20.264
Excuse me, Mr. Bradshaw.

08:20.399 --> 08:21.783
Jay Pritchett,
juror number 3.

08:21.850 --> 08:23.368
Terry. Call me Terry.

08:23.435 --> 08:24.585
How you doing, Terry?
Hi. Good. You?

08:24.653 --> 08:26.103
Hey, this robbery case,
huh?

08:26.171 --> 08:28.039
Now, I know we don't have
all the facts yet,

08:28.106 --> 08:31.492
but I think it might
be hard for me to lock
up a..."Steeler."

08:33.178 --> 08:34.361
I try to keep it light.

08:34.429 --> 08:35.696
You mind if I join you?

08:35.764 --> 08:37.715
No, no, no, free country.
Sit down.

08:37.782 --> 08:39.167
He said "yes"!

08:39.234 --> 08:40.635
The '70s,
it was a better game.

08:40.703 --> 08:42.669
You guys did everything --
offense, defense.

08:42.738 --> 08:46.007
Didn't I see you mow the field
one night before the game?

08:46.075 --> 08:48.092
You know,
that's how I made my money?

08:48.160 --> 08:49.477
I can't actually believe

08:49.544 --> 08:51.746
that I'm having lunch
with Terry Bradshaw.

08:51.813 --> 08:53.214
I mean,
from football fame

08:53.282 --> 08:56.384
to country music stardom
to big-screen idol.

08:56.452 --> 08:57.751
"Smokey and the Bandit II."

08:57.819 --> 08:59.370
Now that was a challenge.

08:59.437 --> 09:00.587
To play yourself,

09:00.655 --> 09:01.839
that can be
kind of tricky.

09:01.907 --> 09:03.508
I thought
you stole the movie.

09:03.575 --> 09:05.009
Ah, stop that.
You're too kind.

09:05.027 --> 09:07.311
You know, not everything
I touch turns to gold.

09:07.363 --> 09:09.563
I mean, I've had my share
of missteps along the way.

09:09.631 --> 09:11.065
Well, right, like
"Failure to Launch," right?

09:11.133 --> 09:12.816
Sorry?
You should be.

09:12.884 --> 09:15.019
I mean, that thing
was a real stinker.

09:15.087 --> 09:16.537
I happen to be proud
of that movie.

09:16.605 --> 09:19.023
I mean, that's some
of the best work
I've ever done.

09:19.090 --> 09:20.291
No, you were good, yeah.

09:20.358 --> 09:22.159
But, I mean,
don't worry about it.
Nobody saw it.

09:22.227 --> 09:24.095
Yeah, well.

09:24.163 --> 09:26.847
Guess it's about time
we get on back in, huh?

09:26.915 --> 09:28.599
Same time tomorrow.

09:28.667 --> 09:30.034
Hey, I'm wide open.

09:31.102 --> 09:32.436
Like in football.

09:36.391 --> 09:38.376
Nobody speaks
to my son like that.

09:38.427 --> 09:39.927
No, no, Mom, Mom, Mom.

09:39.978 --> 09:42.362
Please don't get up
and make a scene and
embarrass me more.

09:42.430 --> 09:43.597
I'm begging you.

09:43.665 --> 09:45.433
Okay, but you don't have
to block me in.

09:45.517 --> 09:46.284
I am not crazy.

09:46.351 --> 09:48.052
I am not
the hot-headed Latina

09:48.120 --> 09:49.704
that you all
make me out to be.

09:49.772 --> 09:52.240
You sent a cow heart to
a children's soccer referee.

09:52.307 --> 09:54.675
Manny, what else
was I supposed to do?

09:54.743 --> 09:56.460
Look, what happened
was a good thing.

09:56.629 --> 09:58.629
He was teaching me
the focus required

09:58.631 --> 09:59.997
to live
the life of an artist,

10:00.065 --> 10:01.715
and that is
a very valuable lesson

10:01.800 --> 10:04.235
that I'll cherish forever.

10:04.302 --> 10:07.355
Okay, Papi, if you're happy,
then I'm happy.

10:08.790 --> 10:10.107
Why don't you pick
your dessert?

10:12.077 --> 10:14.078
Hmm. I wouldn't say no
to an almond cookie

10:14.146 --> 10:15.246
and an espresso and...

10:15.314 --> 10:17.214
you're gone, aren't you?

10:17.282 --> 10:18.683
Honey,
I'll take another --

10:18.750 --> 10:19.684
Shut up.

10:19.751 --> 10:20.952
That's my son over there.

10:21.019 --> 10:23.303
He opened his beautiful soul
to you,

10:23.371 --> 10:26.157
to praise you,
to get some advice from you,

10:26.224 --> 10:27.308
and you were mean to him?

10:27.376 --> 10:29.626
Come on, we both know
that your attitude

10:29.694 --> 10:31.461
is just
a defense mechanism

10:31.529 --> 10:34.415
to protect
the tiny, little ego

10:34.482 --> 10:36.250
from the truth --

10:36.317 --> 10:38.552
that you don't deserve
any praise,

10:38.620 --> 10:40.104
that you're a fraud,

10:40.172 --> 10:44.742
that you're just
a big, fat nobody.

10:51.966 --> 10:53.884
All men break the same.

11:05.480 --> 11:07.381
What's happening?
What is all this?

11:07.448 --> 11:09.283
Go up the next aisle.
Okay.

11:12.153 --> 11:13.404
Oh, God,

11:13.471 --> 11:15.323
I'm loving these new pavers
we picked.

11:15.390 --> 11:17.475
You know what, I'm starting
to have second thoughts.

11:17.526 --> 11:18.792
Oh, no,
this isn't gonna be

11:18.860 --> 11:20.544
another conflict between us,
is it?

11:20.612 --> 11:22.563
Oh, gosh,
I don't want another conflict.

11:22.614 --> 11:23.998
Oh, that's pretty.
Okay...

11:24.933 --> 11:27.184
Okay, you're --
you're not actually putting

11:27.252 --> 11:29.453
a reclaimed wood piece
in our cart, are you?

11:29.521 --> 11:30.471
That's great,
that's great.

11:30.539 --> 11:32.039
No, the whole
"reclaimed wood" aesthetic

11:32.106 --> 11:35.059
is an insulting appropriation
of barn culture.

11:35.061 --> 11:35.793
No, I'm being serious.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.628
It's like when Madonna
wore overalls!

11:37.696 --> 11:39.914
You're good.
Mitchell, take it out.
I don't want it.

11:39.982 --> 11:42.349
I think it's pretty.
I think it's pretty offensive.

11:42.434 --> 11:43.801
Okay, rein it in.

11:43.819 --> 11:45.736
Oh, there she is,
Mother Superior.

11:45.804 --> 11:47.204
Okay, Rumple-thinskin.

11:47.272 --> 11:48.505
Okay, you know what?
I don't need this.

11:48.573 --> 11:49.907
I'm just gonna go
wait in the car.

11:49.942 --> 11:51.208
Perfect, yeah, run away.

11:51.276 --> 11:52.893
And just FYI,
the reason I like barn wood

11:52.961 --> 11:54.795
is 'cause
it reminds me of you.

11:54.863 --> 11:55.646
Really?
Yeah.

11:55.781 --> 11:57.447
I mean I-I know that you
get homesick sometimes,

11:57.499 --> 11:58.866
and I-I want to bring

11:58.933 --> 11:59.917
a little, you know, country
into our house.

11:59.985 --> 12:01.035
I'm sorry.

12:01.103 --> 12:02.537
Didn't mean to offend you.

12:02.588 --> 12:03.721
Oh, you didn't offend me.

12:03.788 --> 12:06.156
I'm just being oversensitive
like you said.

12:06.224 --> 12:07.925
I'm just being
my normal snooty self.

12:07.993 --> 12:09.893
I don't -- I don't know
how you put up with me.

12:10.012 --> 12:11.311
I don't know
how you put up with me.

12:11.379 --> 12:13.548
I do.
Mm.

12:13.615 --> 12:14.631
Excuse me.

12:14.716 --> 12:15.649
Oh.
Yes?

12:15.717 --> 12:16.834
Oh, yes? Hi.

12:16.901 --> 12:18.285
I just need to get by.

12:18.353 --> 12:19.337
Okay.
Okay.

12:21.540 --> 12:23.290
He didn't say it.

12:23.358 --> 12:24.591
He didn't say it.

12:24.676 --> 12:29.479
And last, but not least,
the city at your feet.

12:29.547 --> 12:31.798
Yeah. I'm still kind of
flabbergasted

12:31.866 --> 12:33.484
that there's
no bubble machine.

12:33.552 --> 12:35.202
It's okay.
I can install my own.

12:36.404 --> 12:38.572
Oh, you're judging me?
No, no.

12:38.657 --> 12:40.991
Maybe you're right.

12:41.059 --> 12:42.976
Maybe I am losing touch
with who I am.

12:43.078 --> 12:45.329
All I really need is
three chords and a mattress.

12:45.464 --> 12:46.780
And my chef.

12:49.418 --> 12:51.385
Uh, hey, Phil,
what's happening here?

12:51.419 --> 12:53.153
Oh, not too much.
Phil?

12:53.255 --> 12:55.021
Oh, my God,
you've gone all yellow.

12:55.090 --> 12:56.691
That's like you're song.

12:56.758 --> 12:59.710
Funny thing --
I also like to write mu--

13:01.529 --> 13:03.397
Phil?

13:09.637 --> 13:10.638
What happened?

13:10.706 --> 13:12.706
Mr. Dunphy,
you have acute orchitis.

13:12.774 --> 13:14.492
It's a massively inflamed
testicle.

13:14.559 --> 13:16.109
I'm giving you
an I.V. bag of antibiotics

13:16.177 --> 13:17.494
and some pain meds
because...

13:17.663 --> 13:19.330
Oh, boy.

13:19.397 --> 13:20.747
So embarrassed.

13:21.066 --> 13:23.033
I can't believe I passed out
in front of a rock star.

13:23.101 --> 13:24.852
Please tell me
he didn't know why.

13:24.986 --> 13:25.986
Oh, brilliant,
you're awake.

13:26.054 --> 13:27.321
I've got some ice
for your biscuits.

13:27.388 --> 13:29.390
No.
No, no, no, no, no!

13:29.457 --> 13:30.824
Oh! Oh, that really --

13:30.892 --> 13:32.343
Oh, that feels so good.

13:34.712 --> 13:36.697
Terry, can we talk?
Please don't shut me out.

13:36.765 --> 13:38.282
I know I messed up,

13:38.350 --> 13:39.767
and I'm so sorry
for my...

13:39.835 --> 13:42.269
failure at lunch.

13:42.337 --> 13:44.889
Sir, please sit down.
Do you mind?

13:44.956 --> 13:46.190
Same seats.

13:46.258 --> 13:47.358
Let's proceed.

13:47.426 --> 13:48.942
Juror number 10,

13:49.010 --> 13:50.694
has anyone in your family

13:50.762 --> 13:53.264
ever been the victim
of a violent crime?

13:53.332 --> 13:56.100
Well...my mother...

13:56.167 --> 13:57.418
Psst!
Not you, keep going.

13:57.486 --> 13:58.652
Oh, actually,

13:58.720 --> 13:59.987
could you tap him
on the shoulder?

14:00.055 --> 14:02.373
Juror 11,
is this man bothering you?

14:02.440 --> 14:03.724
You talking about
the movie critic right here?

14:03.792 --> 14:05.826
Absolutely,
he's bothering me!
Objection!

14:05.893 --> 14:08.246
I request permission
to approach Mr. Bradshaw.

14:08.313 --> 14:09.746
No! I mean, denied!

14:09.798 --> 14:11.465
Look, that's not a thing
you can ask.

14:11.532 --> 14:13.984
Your Honor, we'd like
to dismiss Juror number 3.

14:14.052 --> 14:15.068
What?! No, no.

14:15.136 --> 14:16.286
I'll be good.
I promise.

14:16.354 --> 14:18.606
Sir,
you have to leave now.

14:18.623 --> 14:19.707
Fine.

14:19.775 --> 14:21.175
I'm going.

14:23.996 --> 14:27.214
I'll be waiting
in the parking lot, buddy.

14:27.282 --> 14:29.600
Judge hit me
with a restraining order.

14:29.667 --> 14:32.719
But Terry had to sign it.

14:32.787 --> 14:35.472
We're gonna get through
this together, Phillip.

14:35.540 --> 14:38.392
I guess I just don't
understand why you're here.

14:38.460 --> 14:40.144
Well, because you really
reached me back there,

14:40.211 --> 14:42.029
and I realized I got to be
more of a regular guy.

14:42.097 --> 14:44.682
Mr. Dunphy, I have your --
Chris Martin.

14:44.749 --> 14:46.533
Wow. I'm a huge fan.

14:46.601 --> 14:48.569
Can I get a picture
with you?
No.

14:48.637 --> 14:49.670
I want a picture
with you.

14:49.738 --> 14:50.771
Come on.

14:50.839 --> 14:51.822
Let's do it.

14:51.890 --> 14:53.941
Phil,
25 million followers.

14:54.009 --> 14:55.126
No, thank you.

14:55.193 --> 14:56.744
Uh,
I'd love some privacy.
All right.

14:56.811 --> 14:58.629
Is there maybe a room
opening up?

14:58.697 --> 14:59.913
Phil? Honey?

14:59.981 --> 15:01.948
I came just as soon as
Chris called me.

15:02.016 --> 15:03.200
Hello.

15:03.268 --> 15:04.201
Claire,
I've got to say, uh...

15:04.269 --> 15:05.820
You're even more beautiful

15:05.887 --> 15:07.171
than you are
in Phil's photos.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.089
Pbht!

15:09.157 --> 15:10.541
I like your music.
Well, thank you.

15:10.608 --> 15:11.876
Claire, can I talk to you
for one second?

15:11.943 --> 15:12.876
Yes, of course,
sweetie, yes.

15:12.944 --> 15:14.544
Yeah.
Yeah.

15:14.612 --> 15:16.630
I want
Chris Martin to leave.

15:16.697 --> 15:17.898
Hm? What? Why?

15:17.966 --> 15:19.616
It's weird that he's here
when I'm like this,

15:19.684 --> 15:20.835
and he's attracting
attention.

15:20.902 --> 15:24.104
Oh, I don't think...
yeah, okay.

15:24.172 --> 15:25.572
Claire?
Mm...

15:25.657 --> 15:27.391
Oh, you're not
gonna like this.

15:27.458 --> 15:29.176
This is so exciting!

15:29.243 --> 15:31.228
You invited
your book club?!

15:31.296 --> 15:33.230
We're huge fans.

15:33.297 --> 15:34.148
Hang on.

15:34.215 --> 15:36.350
A book club
sounds kind of regular.

15:36.417 --> 15:37.784
I should
join one of those.

15:37.852 --> 15:39.437
There's about to be
an opening in ours.

15:39.504 --> 15:41.238
I'm the one
who invited you here.

15:41.306 --> 15:43.641
And what are you beautiful,
uh, scholars reading?

15:43.709 --> 15:45.492
"The Unwitting
Miss Castle."

15:45.560 --> 15:47.561
Mm. I love that book.

15:47.629 --> 15:49.964
Although I did find
the fences metaphor

15:50.031 --> 15:51.481
a little mundane.

15:51.549 --> 15:52.816
Oh, yes. Pretentious.
Completely agree.

15:52.884 --> 15:54.685
I said the exact same thing
last week,

15:54.753 --> 15:57.738
and you guys just
rolled your eyes at me.

15:57.740 --> 15:59.523
Claire, don't be
such a Mrs. Devereaux.

15:59.591 --> 16:01.325
Twinsies!

16:01.392 --> 16:02.410
That is so you!
Hey, Phil.

16:02.477 --> 16:04.695
Our photo got
25,000 likes.

16:04.762 --> 16:07.147
Phil?
Phil?

16:07.899 --> 16:09.200
Ohh...

16:09.267 --> 16:10.417
it's probably
all the meds.

16:10.484 --> 16:11.635
I'll handle this.

16:11.703 --> 16:13.320
I've been to Burning Man
with Keith Richards.

16:13.388 --> 16:14.254
No, no, no.
I'll handle it.

16:14.322 --> 16:16.707
I've been on vacation
with my mother.

16:16.775 --> 16:19.493
Hey...

16:19.560 --> 16:21.829
Hey.
Where are you off to,
stranger?

16:21.896 --> 16:23.597
Honey,
I need to be alone.

16:23.664 --> 16:25.199
Oh, honey,
I'm sorry I invited

16:25.266 --> 16:26.533
the girls from book club.

16:26.535 --> 16:28.785
It's -- I just wanted them
to like me.

16:28.853 --> 16:30.571
I can't believe
this happened.

16:30.639 --> 16:32.973
This was supposed to be
such an amazing day.
I know.

16:33.040 --> 16:34.458
Is there anything I can do
to make it better?

16:34.526 --> 16:35.792
Yes.

16:35.860 --> 16:38.312
You can make Chris Martin
go away, now.

16:39.797 --> 16:41.115
I'm so sorry, guys.

16:41.182 --> 16:42.716
I-I didn't mean
to cause a --
Oh, no, no, no, no.

16:42.784 --> 16:44.217
It's -- it's not you
personally.

16:44.285 --> 16:45.986
No, no, no, it is me.
I'm a distraction.

16:46.053 --> 16:47.120
Everyone wants to say "hi"

16:47.188 --> 16:48.255
or they want
to take a picture

16:48.323 --> 16:49.523
or they want
to sleep with me.

16:49.591 --> 16:51.992
They sure do.
Shut 'er down, Marie.

16:52.060 --> 16:53.444
And it's a nightmare.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.679
It's beginning to affect
my creativity.

16:55.747 --> 16:57.981
The last song I wrote
was about my helicopter.

16:58.049 --> 16:59.549
I was too ashamed
to release it.

16:59.617 --> 17:01.752
I had to sell it to Qantus
for $1 million.

17:01.820 --> 17:03.837
Your problems
are so sanguine.

17:03.905 --> 17:05.172
Is that
how you use that word?

17:05.239 --> 17:06.455
Nobody knows.

17:06.523 --> 17:08.358
Oh, anyway, I wish there
was something I could do

17:08.426 --> 17:09.577
to make this all better.

17:09.644 --> 17:10.511
You could buy
that house.

17:10.578 --> 17:11.627
No, Phil.

17:11.630 --> 17:13.012
Thanks to you,
that's the old me.

17:13.080 --> 17:14.548
Oh, good.

17:14.616 --> 17:17.217
I know something
you could do for him.

Why would he not pick us?

17:52.119 --> 17:53.337
Yeah, we gave him
everything he wants --

17:53.404 --> 17:54.722
a fight,
reconciliation...
Yeah.

17:54.789 --> 17:56.090
...not to mention
we're camera-ready.

17:56.157 --> 17:57.508
It's everything
TV wants to be.

17:57.576 --> 17:58.892
I mean, what does
he want us to do,

17:58.960 --> 18:00.227
write the episode for him?

18:00.294 --> 18:02.279
Yeah, America deserves
to see us get a free gazebo.

18:02.347 --> 18:03.897
There he is.

18:03.899 --> 18:05.549
I have half a mind
to go over there
and confront him.

18:05.600 --> 18:06.599
Yeah, well,
I have the other half.

18:06.735 --> 18:08.302
Wait, wait.
Hi.

18:08.370 --> 18:09.186
Hi.
Hi.

18:09.253 --> 18:10.537
Excuse us.
Can I help you guys?

18:10.605 --> 18:11.955
Yeah, how about
an explanation?

18:12.023 --> 18:13.374
Why aren't you picking us
for your show?

18:13.441 --> 18:14.858
Yeah, what --
are we not sexy enough?

18:14.925 --> 18:15.976
Not young enough
for your demo?

18:16.043 --> 18:17.577
Wait, no, is it
'cause we're gay?

18:17.662 --> 18:18.896
You know, I've actually
never seen a gay couple

18:18.963 --> 18:20.164
on your little program.

18:20.231 --> 18:21.831
Yeah, or a P.E.
teacher-slash-vice principal.

18:21.899 --> 18:23.884
He's literally that.
Just tell us why
you're not picking us.

18:23.952 --> 18:25.920
Guys, I don't have a show
anymore.

18:26.037 --> 18:27.137
Please, we just saw
that episode --
Yeah.

18:27.205 --> 18:28.956
Deb and Don in San Antonio
last week?
Yeah.

18:29.023 --> 18:31.058
Oh...
Don wanted
a place to grill.

18:31.125 --> 18:32.609
We got canceled,
like, two years ago.
What?

18:32.677 --> 18:33.960
What, why?
Yeah.

18:34.028 --> 18:34.929
It's such
a popular show!
I mean...

18:34.996 --> 18:35.896
Look, uh...

18:37.282 --> 18:38.348
The network fired me...

18:38.416 --> 18:39.900
Why?
...when they found out

18:39.968 --> 18:41.668
that I had this website
where people paid

18:41.736 --> 18:43.737
to watch me
build stuff naked.

18:43.804 --> 18:45.156
Is that so?
Yeah.

18:45.223 --> 18:46.490
How naked?
Very.

18:46.558 --> 18:47.340
You know what,
why are you hanging out

18:47.408 --> 18:48.609
in the aisles
of a home store?

18:48.676 --> 18:49.610
I work here.

18:49.677 --> 18:51.278
Ohh.
You do. Oh.
Yeah.

18:51.345 --> 18:52.546
Hey, if you did

18:52.614 --> 18:53.714
still have a show, um...

18:53.782 --> 18:55.815
Uh-huh?
...would you pick us?

18:55.883 --> 18:57.251
Umm...

18:57.318 --> 18:59.587
It costs you nothing
to say "yes."

18:59.654 --> 19:01.154
Oh, my God,
we agreed again.

19:01.222 --> 19:02.355
Ohh.
Aww.

19:04.759 --> 19:06.460
I begged you
not to go over there.

19:06.528 --> 19:07.861
I'm so embarrassed.

19:07.929 --> 19:08.946
Why?

19:09.013 --> 19:10.414
He's the one crying.

19:10.482 --> 19:11.765
My favorite part was

19:11.832 --> 19:13.984
when he was gasping for air
between sobs,

19:14.051 --> 19:15.218
like a baby.

19:15.270 --> 19:16.670
Look at him.
He's broken.

19:17.855 --> 19:19.055
What if he never
writes again?

19:19.123 --> 19:21.458
Okay, I'll apologize
to the 12 people

19:21.526 --> 19:23.310
who still go out
and watch plays.

19:23.312 --> 19:24.812
You do know
I'm a theater major, right?

19:24.896 --> 19:26.864
Yes, and when you're
a great play writer

19:26.931 --> 19:28.465
and you go
to a restaurant --

19:28.483 --> 19:29.783
if you can afford it --

19:29.851 --> 19:32.019
then you're gonna be nice
to strangers,

19:32.086 --> 19:34.872
because that's
the right thing to do, okay?

19:34.939 --> 19:36.573
Excuse me.
I don't mean to interrupt.

19:36.641 --> 19:39.659
But I saw
what happened before,
and I'm sorry about that.

19:39.777 --> 19:41.795
But the way you stood up
to that jerk Anvilmaker

19:41.863 --> 19:42.997
was kind of amazing, yeah.

19:43.081 --> 19:44.515
Good for you.

19:44.582 --> 19:45.966
And, young man, listen --

19:46.084 --> 19:47.468
if this makes you
feel any better,

19:47.535 --> 19:49.753
he did the same thing
to me.
Oh.

19:49.921 --> 19:51.138
That's very nice of you
to say.
Yeah.

19:51.206 --> 19:52.723
Thank you so much.
So...

19:52.791 --> 19:54.258
Thank you.

19:55.876 --> 19:58.345
You know, I, uh...
I write.

19:58.412 --> 19:59.630
Oh, boy.

19:59.697 --> 20:01.231
No, it's not like
I'm just some,
you know, some --

20:01.299 --> 20:02.516
excuse me -- some --

20:02.583 --> 20:04.618
you know,
just some city slicker who --

20:04.686 --> 20:06.286
who doesn't know
what he's talking about.

20:06.353 --> 20:08.522
But, uh, if I could
teach you one thing,

20:08.589 --> 20:11.842
just one thing
that you learn from this,

20:11.910 --> 20:16.346
it'll make your plays sound
and look marvelous.

20:16.414 --> 20:18.282
You know?

20:20.001 --> 20:22.870
So, the most important thing
is to --

20:22.937 --> 20:25.738
is to know that writing
is really re-writing.

20:25.790 --> 20:27.390
You may want to jot
that down.

20:27.458 --> 20:29.126
Uh...
And then change it.

20:29.193 --> 20:30.628
Did you see
what I did there?

20:30.695 --> 20:31.745
You know what?

20:31.813 --> 20:33.863
We really need to be
somewhere right now.

20:33.931 --> 20:34.832
Yeah, we better go.
Okay.

20:34.899 --> 20:37.417
Yeah.
All right.

20:37.502 --> 20:38.585
Okay, thank you.

20:38.653 --> 20:40.353
Mm-hmm.
Hm.

20:40.421 --> 20:42.706
I'm sorry, we didn't realize
we were so annoying.

20:42.774 --> 20:43.974
Our bad.

20:45.710 --> 20:47.761
Have fun
storming the castle!

20:48.763 --> 20:49.613
Nothing.

20:49.781 --> 20:51.214
