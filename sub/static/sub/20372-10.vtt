00:08.216 --> 00:10.886
I don't want to be romanced. I want to be loved.

00:10.928 --> 00:13.096
<i>Previously on "You Me Her"...</i> Clomid time.

00:13.138 --> 00:14.515
You must <i>really</i> want a kid.

00:14.556 --> 00:16.141
I must.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.310
My professional recommendation would be surrogacy.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.603
Well, how do we start?

00:19.645 --> 00:21.897
Uh, how about we start with a conversation?

00:21.939 --> 00:23.106
What are you guys talking about?

00:23.148 --> 00:24.525
We want you to have our baby.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.235
Like,<i> our</i> baby. All three of us.

00:27.277 --> 00:28.570
It kind of feels like,

00:28.612 --> 00:30.155
like we're supposed to do this together.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.532
Does no one think we should just, like,

00:31.573 --> 00:32.992
hit the brakes just a little?

00:33.033 --> 00:34.409
We're just going to delay the announcement

00:34.451 --> 00:36.495
of your promotion a couple of weeks.

00:36.537 --> 00:37.830
Did I hear you say that you were --

00:37.872 --> 00:39.790
I hate my boss and I want to quit my job?

00:39.832 --> 00:41.750
You know how long I've wanted to start

00:39.832 --> 00:41.750
my own firm.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.418
Fuck! Fuck me!

00:43.460 --> 00:44.920
Actually, I was yelling at my boss.

00:44.962 --> 00:47.046
She found out I was scouting office space,

00:47.088 --> 00:49.758
so she's blackballing me at the few places I can afford.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.050
So much for women helping women.

00:51.092 --> 00:52.845
I'm not a woman. I'm an architect.

00:52.887 --> 00:54.722
What's this? Hey.

00:54.763 --> 00:56.097
Coolest firm in Seattle.

00:54.763 --> 00:56.097
Thanks so much, Kylie.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.391
I don't -- I don't even know what to say.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.727
Everyone at Pinnacle is buzzing about me.

00:59.768 --> 01:00.728
Wha

01:00.769 --> 01:02.187
I'm buzz-worthy.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.732
Have you crossed into seriously considering this?

01:04.773 --> 01:07.401
I have no fucking clue who I am or --

01:07.442 --> 01:08.861
or what I want.

01:08.903 --> 01:11.030
I think we both know what you want.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.114

01:13.156 --> 01:14.199

01:16.994 --> 01:19.830
Emma, Izzy, will you start a family with me?

01:24.209 --> 01:25.377
Um...

01:37.472 --> 01:38.974
Um...

01:39.016 --> 01:41.435
O-Okay, I, um...

01:41.476 --> 01:43.270
I'm really into the "us" part

01:43.311 --> 01:46.231
and...the "love" part, but...

01:46.273 --> 01:48.025
as far as this whole "family" thing goes,

01:48.067 --> 01:50.903
I mean, didn't we just enter this musing phase,

01:48.067 --> 01:50.903
like, yesterday?

01:52.696 --> 01:55.074
Not the reaction I was expecting.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.409
Well, what Jack is proposing

01:57.451 --> 02:01.288
is actually called "reciprocal in vitro fertilization."

02:01.329 --> 02:02.957
It basically means that,

02:02.998 --> 02:06.085
um, we'd be bringing two women to the party

02:06.126 --> 02:07.419
instead of one.

02:08.837 --> 02:10.338
Um...sorry,

02:10.380 --> 02:12.716
but kneeling is a... young man's game.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.551
Oh, sorry. Here.

02:14.593 --> 02:15.719
Uh... Just...

02:15.761 --> 02:17.846
Yeah, let's sit. I'm a little dizzy.

02:17.888 --> 02:19.139
Okay.

02:21.058 --> 02:22.059
Whew.

02:31.068 --> 02:32.653
How do you know all that in vitro stuff?

02:34.113 --> 02:35.697
Interwebs.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.365
So, you've been researching.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.826
Which means...

02:38.867 --> 02:39.952
that you're open to the idea.

02:39.994 --> 02:41.411
Yeah.

02:43.371 --> 02:45.833
In fact, um...

02:45.874 --> 02:48.961
I did some Yelping for IVF clinics,

02:49.003 --> 02:51.170
and I made an appointment.

02:53.423 --> 02:54.549
Relax, it -- it --

02:54.591 --> 02:55.884
there was a cancellation.

02:55.926 --> 02:57.552
The next opening was six weeks away,

02:57.594 --> 03:00.555
and we can totally wait if that's what you want.

03:01.974 --> 03:03.767
Appointment to what

03:03.809 --> 03:05.519
No, what -- no, no.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.687
It's just a consultation --

03:06.728 --> 03:08.105
just to make sure

03:08.147 --> 03:10.357
that the, you know, option is even on the table.

03:10.398 --> 03:12.442
It's still your eggs, Em.

03:12.484 --> 03:13.819
We'd all have to agree.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.529
Yeah.

03:15.570 --> 03:16.697
When is this appointment?

03:16.738 --> 03:18.615
4:00.

03:18.657 --> 03:19.491
Tomorrow.

03:27.958 --> 03:28.876
Honey, it's just --

03:28.917 --> 03:30.794
Yeah, no, I...I heard.

03:30.836 --> 03:32.420
It's just a consultation.

03:32.462 --> 03:33.755
Are you mad?

03:33.797 --> 03:35.549
'Cause we can -- we can totally blow it off.

03:35.590 --> 03:36.884
I can call them back.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.593
No, no. I'm not mad.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.682
I don't even know what I am.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.522
And I don't know if...

03:52.858 --> 03:54.609
You know, I'm not sure if I still want a --

03:54.651 --> 03:56.570
You're not sure that you still want a baby?

03:58.238 --> 03:59.406
Well, fuck.

03:59.447 --> 04:01.116
That would certainly change things.

04:01.158 --> 04:02.910
Seven years, Jack. I think part of me

04:04.786 --> 04:06.538
just surrendered.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.498
Okay, but...

04:08.540 --> 04:11.043
what if you knew that it would work?

04:11.085 --> 04:13.712
What if you knew the three of us could start a family?

04:13.754 --> 04:15.255
Would you feel differently?

04:22.554 --> 04:24.305
You really did all this?

04:29.603 --> 04:31.105
You think I'm crazy?

04:31.146 --> 04:32.606
No.

04:32.647 --> 04:35.067
Well, maybe a little.

04:36.151 --> 04:37.236
So?

04:40.447 --> 04:42.908
So...

04:42.950 --> 04:44.159
let's do this.

04:46.245 --> 04:48.789
Yeah? But just -- just the

Yeah.

Fair? Definitely.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.503

11:24.184 --> 11:25.435
Yeah? Yeah.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.147
Might be 'cause you're mostly gay.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.940
Yeah.

Sure. That explains it.

Hey, baby daddy.

22:09.578 --> 22:10.704
Hey.

22:30.474 --> 22:33.853
You know, the last time we sat on the bench together,

22:33.894 --> 22:37.023
I left and consumed a dangerous volume of vodka,

22:37.064 --> 22:39.817
jalapeño kettle chips, and pistachio ice cream...

22:42.360 --> 22:44.030
'cause I had fallen for a married couple

22:44.071 --> 22:46.032
and I could never, ever see them again.

22:50.577 --> 22:53.789
I went home and had sex with my wife,

22:53.831 --> 22:57.459
who...told me you gave her a footjob under the table...

22:59.879 --> 23:02.131
...and made out with her...

23:02.173 --> 23:06.010
and that...you weren't her<i> first</i> girl...

23:06.052 --> 23:08.304
or her second.

23:08.346 --> 23:10.723
It turns out you weren't her third, either.

23:10.764 --> 23:12.850
Rough.

23:15.936 --> 23:17.897
That's when everything changed.

23:32.828 --> 23:35.081
Look, I want this...

23:37.708 --> 23:39.210
