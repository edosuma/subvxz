02:03.999 --> 02:08.044
Now, I say we stop off at Juan PetrÃ³n's
for one jolly big dram

02:08.127 --> 02:10.128
and one ginger beer with cream.

02:10.214 --> 02:14.467
- Who gets the whisky?
- The one closest to the coffin.

02:14.551 --> 02:20.097
Anyway, if I buy you a dram, you must
promise not to tell the other boys.

02:20.182 --> 02:21.766
It's a promise.

02:31.026 --> 02:34.153
Oh, no. Not another hanging.

02:57.386 --> 02:58.553
Shit.

03:07.062 --> 03:10.189
- Howdy.
- Come on, lad.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.069
Hurry up. Don't be afraid.

03:51.523 --> 03:54.191
- You want to play games?
- Red-assed Mexican.

03:54.192 --> 03:56.819
You do it with your horse!

03:57.362 --> 04:00.323
- Mexican greaser!
- White chickenshit!

04:00.407 --> 04:04.327
- Come on, greaser. Cut me down!
- Hey, knock it off! Knock it off!

04:04.411 --> 04:07.413
Cut me down, Mexican!
Cut me down, Mexican!

04:07.497 --> 04:09.749
Knock it off.
You know better, Chavez.

04:09.833 --> 04:12.960
- Navajo! Navajo!
- That's enough!

04:15.130 --> 04:18.673
John's back. Wash up,
and into supper clothes.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.093
Now! Both of you!

04:28.685 --> 04:33.356
- Who are them?
- "They", William. "Who are they?"

04:34.358 --> 04:36.400
They are the boys of the dregs.

04:36.485 --> 04:41.781
The flotsam and jetsam
of frontier society, if you will.

04:41.865 --> 04:44.575
We've got room in the bunkhouse,
my young man.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.035
If you don't want to stay,

04:46.119 --> 04:49.956
the Santa Fe runs out of Albuquerque
in the morning.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.958
Glad you're back, Doc.

04:52.042 --> 04:54.377
Start hauling the rope inside.

04:54.378 --> 04:56.212
John bring another hard case in?

04:56.296 --> 04:59.548
- Hope it ain't another Mexican.
- Mexican-Indian.

04:59.633 --> 05:03.761
If you do wish to stay,
we have just the job for you.

05:09.977 --> 05:13.896
- He ain't all there, is he?
- You son of a bitch!

05:29.913 --> 05:33.833
Hey, did you know pigs
is as smart as dogs?

05:33.917 --> 05:37.753
Yeah, it's true.
I knew a fella in El Capitan,

05:37.838 --> 05:40.756
taught his pig to bark at strangers.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.553
What you doin' here, boy?

05:46.930 --> 05:49.432
We work for Mr Tunstall
as regulators.

05:54.855 --> 05:59.608
Mr Tunstall's got a soft spot
for runaways, derelicts, vagrant types.

05:59.609 --> 06:02.194
But you can't be any geek off the street.

06:02.279 --> 06:06.657
Got to be handy with the steel.
Earn your keep.

06:06.742 --> 06:08.784
Go on, go on, get!

06:08.785 --> 06:15.124
Not that I'm a pistoleer or a knifesmith
like that greaser Chavez Chavez.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.878
I'm a pugilist.

06:18.962 --> 06:23.632
But then, I ain't expectin' you
to know that word, hog boy!

06:25.719 --> 06:28.804
- You don't even know why I'm here.
- Sure I do.

06:28.889 --> 06:32.475
You're a runaway,
derelict vagrant like the rest of us.

06:32.559 --> 06:37.480
Footpad, maybe? Petty thief?
Rob a bank? Kill somebody?

06:40.067 --> 06:42.359
Killed somebody, huh?

06:44.738 --> 06:46.322
Regulators!

06:46.323 --> 06:50.868
You ain't no regulator! Stay here with
the pork. You might learn something.

06:50.869 --> 06:55.081
Cattle look spooked in the lower 40.
Let's take a look.

06:55.499 --> 06:57.500
Smart ass.

07:02.130 --> 07:05.716
Well, now.
Look at those appetites, hm?

07:08.386 --> 07:11.097
William. Have some more.

07:15.018 --> 07:18.562
You ever worked beef before, Billy?

07:23.693 --> 07:26.112
Did the chow line.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.823
But, uh, I got a way with cattle.

07:34.538 --> 07:37.873
What's so jolly funny,
Master Steven?

07:37.958 --> 07:40.918
That's no proper table manners.

07:42.629 --> 07:45.047
Got a way with hogs.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.884
Congratulations, Charles.

07:48.969 --> 07:53.013
You and Steven
will do the dirty crockery alone.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.643
Sorry, John. Struck me funny.

07:57.727 --> 08:00.146
And to William. Both of you.

08:01.940 --> 08:06.068
Apologies, William.
Just hackin' on you, that's all.

08:06.153 --> 08:09.488
Yeah, we was just hackin' on you.

08:16.288 --> 08:20.749
Rumour has it you killed a man, Billy.
You don't seem like the killing sort.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.002
Yeah, Billy, what you kill him for?

08:26.006 --> 08:28.924
He was hackin' on me.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.308
"There are...

08:38.309 --> 08:41.477
plenty of men...

08:41.479 --> 08:45.274
who will never secede... "

08:45.275 --> 08:46.984
Succeed.

08:48.612 --> 08:52.781
Suc... "... who will never
succeed anywhere. "

08:52.866 --> 08:55.993
Got a whole roomful of 'em right here.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.206
Well done.

09:02.626 --> 09:03.876
William.

09:09.633 --> 09:13.469
- Yeah, sure.
- Well, excuse me, Billy.

09:13.470 --> 09:16.889
Very sorry to offend you.

09:16.973 --> 09:20.351
But we're congregated here
to learn to read and write.

09:20.435 --> 09:25.022
You need more than skill with a firearm
to succeed in the New World, Billy.

09:25.106 --> 09:30.152
So take up the journal
and start where the other boy left off,

09:30.237 --> 09:35.157
or you can go straight back
to your home on the streets.

09:39.162 --> 09:42.331
"Young men who don't know
how to do any kind of business

09:42.415 --> 09:44.667
and have no energy or application

09:44.751 --> 09:49.046
had better stay at home near their
relatives so they can be taken care of. "

09:49.047 --> 09:52.007
"They are not wanted here
and will only come to grief. "

09:52.092 --> 09:57.096
"But men of enterprise
are practically sure of success. "

09:57.847 --> 10:00.391
Splendid.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.644
A splendid reading, William.

10:04.229 --> 10:06.730
Thank you.
Good night, gentlemen.

10:06.731 --> 10:09.441
Good night, Mr Tunstall.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.640
Shit.

10:41.725 --> 10:44.727
Whoa! Son of a bitch!

11:03.663 --> 11:07.124
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Afternoon, John.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.834
Mr Dolan and Mr Murphy here

11:08.918 --> 11:12.588
are complainin' about their
merchandise wagon being plundered

11:12.672 --> 11:16.091
on several occasions
on the way into town.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.093
They think you're behind it.

11:18.178 --> 11:22.306
- That's a fargin' lie, and you know it!
- Richard.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.809
Sheriff Brady.

11:29.439 --> 11:33.484
Until I'm pronounced a thief
and shaken out of Lincoln.

11:33.568 --> 11:36.111
I've never touched his property.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.364
I have no cause.

11:39.324 --> 11:41.492
Well!

11:41.493 --> 11:44.411
The belted earl has spoken.

11:45.205 --> 11:49.458
Look behind you, Earl.
All I see are hired thieves.

11:49.542 --> 11:53.295
These boys are promising
young men acquiring an education.

11:53.296 --> 11:56.632
I've had you pegged as the type that...

11:56.633 --> 11:58.801
that likes...

12:00.804 --> 12:04.348
educatin' young boys, Englishman.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.686
Tunstall.

12:09.687 --> 12:15.317
Rumour has it you're bidding against
me for the government beef contracts.

12:15.318 --> 12:18.320
It is just rumour, isn't it?

12:18.321 --> 12:23.158
Lawrence, you have a beef outfit
and a store.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.869
I have a beef outfit and a store.

12:25.954 --> 12:29.164
We're both going to try to make money.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.625
It's simple, and it's fair.

12:34.337 --> 12:38.173
You see our good sheriff
sittin' on that horse?

12:38.174 --> 12:41.510
Do you know how much money
he's got invested in my store?

12:41.594 --> 12:44.680
His life savings, John.

12:44.681 --> 12:49.101
It's not just Brady who wants me
to get those contracts.

12:49.185 --> 12:52.855
It's the territorial district attorney,
the chief justice,

12:58.611 --> 13:00.904
This is a family thing, John.

13:00.989 --> 13:06.952
Don't come prancin' in with your fat,
foreign capital, tryin' to change things.

13:07.036 --> 13:11.540
I made a very long steamship journey
from London, Mr Murphy,

13:12.041 --> 13:18.088
so I shall be damned if I'm going to be
dissuaded by political corruption.

13:18.089 --> 13:23.469
So I'd like you to take your threats and
your sheriff and get off my property.

13:23.553 --> 13:26.722
You're ambitious, Earl.

13:27.640 --> 13:31.393
But you'd be better off selling
ladies' undergarments in Hampstead.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.983
All right, men, that's enough.
Put 'em away.

13:38.067 --> 13:42.654
This is a new country. We won't
bow down to you no more, Englishman.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.658
Get ready for hell.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.077
Come on!

13:53.041 --> 13:55.375
Back to work, chaps.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.829
Mr Tunstall?
My name's J McCloskey.

14:32.914 --> 14:35.499
I heard you're having
some trouble finding help.

14:35.583 --> 14:38.293
McCloskey?
You're one of Murphy's boys.

14:38.378 --> 14:42.005
Used to be. He fired me.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.675
I called him a fat sow.

14:44.759 --> 14:46.760
Did you?

14:47.720 --> 14:49.846
Lovely.

14:49.931 --> 14:52.266
Bunkhouse is over there.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.911
Get down!

16:04.380 --> 16:06.840
Regulators!

16:10.595 --> 16:11.970
Let's dance.

16:50.259 --> 16:54.471
- Look at Billy Bonney go.
- He ain't all there, is he?

17:01.604 --> 17:06.525
He's there enough to be dancin'
while we pull our tallywhackers.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.777
Damn straight.

17:09.945 --> 17:12.030
Come on.

17:12.115 --> 17:17.202
We have to expose this ring, Alex.
Can you get me in to see the governor?

17:17.286 --> 17:19.954
Murphy's beat us to it,

17:20.039 --> 17:23.625
and he brought the governor
a nice, fat campaign contribution.

17:23.626 --> 17:27.838
They're tightening the yoke, John.
They want me out, too.

17:27.922 --> 17:31.883
With me gone, no lawyer would be
crazy enough to represent you.

17:31.968 --> 17:35.178
You've heard of English tenacity,
haven't you?

17:35.179 --> 17:39.349
Here's to enough grit
to finish the last round.

17:44.105 --> 17:47.941
Besides, if we gave in and left,

17:49.485 --> 17:51.194
who'd look after my boys?

17:51.279 --> 17:54.239
- Oh, uh, medicine.
- Oh.

17:54.323 --> 17:59.035
Yes, I shall receive my degree
from St Michael's in July,

17:59.036 --> 18:04.833
and then I shall practise here in Lincoln
until my missionary to the islands.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.626
Isn't that nice?

18:34.238 --> 18:36.740
Howdy. My name's Doc.

18:36.741 --> 18:39.910
What can I do for you,
young man?

18:39.911 --> 18:42.579
If you're an acquaintance
of the young miss,

18:45.875 --> 18:48.043
Why, certainly.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.504
Thank you.

18:58.763 --> 19:01.932
- What's your name?
- Yen Sun.

19:01.933 --> 19:04.059
That's beautiful.

19:06.020 --> 19:08.313
You're a friend of Mr Murphy's?

19:08.397 --> 19:11.775
- He is my guardian.
- Oh.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.744
- Hello, there.
- Hello back.

19:22.745 --> 19:24.746
William Bonney, sir.

19:24.747 --> 19:27.499
Pat Garrett. Pleasure.

19:27.583 --> 19:31.837
Excuse us, friend.
We have a request for the band.

19:35.383 --> 19:37.384
Pat Garrett.

19:44.308 --> 19:47.435
I'll bet I get to be just as big as him.

19:49.063 --> 19:51.606
Nah...

19:51.607 --> 19:53.608
bigger.

19:55.695 --> 19:59.322
"So shows the snowy dove
trooping with crows,

19:59.323 --> 20:02.534
as yonder lady
o'er her fellows shows. "

20:04.245 --> 20:06.204
- Pardon me?
- Oh.

20:06.289 --> 20:08.331
That's a poem.

20:08.332 --> 20:12.043
I'm a poet. I wrote it.

20:12.128 --> 20:15.630
I'm sorry, young man,
but we must be gettin' along.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.674
We're getting along famously.

20:19.927 --> 20:22.721
You're part of the Tunstall company.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.890
Yes, I am.

20:24.974 --> 20:31.313
Then I'll be expectin' to see you follow
your Englishman out of Lincoln.

20:33.316 --> 20:37.903
You tell him... Tell that slug to leave
no slime on the road behind him

20:37.987 --> 20:41.072
when he crawls back
to Wharf Street.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.663
- OK, Doc.
- Hey!

20:48.748 --> 20:51.708
Alex! How ya doin'?

20:51.792 --> 20:56.713
- Someone break up your dance?
- Yeah. He's the girl's guardian.

20:57.173 --> 21:01.343
- Guardian? That's a gentle euphemism.
- Why?

21:01.427 --> 21:04.596
He had a shirt ruined
in a Silver City laundry.

21:04.680 --> 21:08.308
He took the Celestial woman's
daughter as payment.

21:09.101 --> 21:12.729
- What?
- She's house entertainment.

21:13.814 --> 21:17.067
- You can dance with Susan. It's safer.
- Yeah.

21:18.027 --> 21:20.362
Yeah.

21:36.128 --> 21:40.048
- Out of the way, mister.
- I do beg your pardon.

21:40.049 --> 21:42.300
- Come on. You and me.
- No, no, no.

21:42.385 --> 21:44.719
No, it's you and I.

21:46.222 --> 21:50.684
- Isn't that right, John? You and I?
- Yes, yes, it is.

21:56.399 --> 21:58.900
You... and I.

22:25.928 --> 22:27.971
- Pugilist.
- He's somethin'.

22:28.055 --> 22:29.973
Happy New Year!

22:36.105 --> 22:39.065
Happy New Year!

22:44.280 --> 22:49.534
# And never brought to mind?

22:49.618 --> 22:55.165
# Should auld acquaintance be forgot

22:55.249 --> 23:00.670
# And days of auld lang syne?

23:00.755 --> 23:05.508
# For auld lang syne...

23:05.593 --> 23:11.347
# Should auld acquaintance be forgot

23:22.485 --> 23:27.739
# For the sake of auld lang syne?

23:27.823 --> 23:33.078
# For auld lang syne, my friend...

23:47.343 --> 23:50.095
Go on, Billy. Boys will be boys.

24:25.381 --> 24:28.007
No, no! There's too many!

24:30.136 --> 24:32.428
Get out of here!

24:48.070 --> 24:52.615
"For as much as it has pleased
Almighty God in his wise providence

24:52.700 --> 24:56.411
to take out of this world
the soul of our deceased brother,

24:56.495 --> 24:59.914
we therefore commit
his body to the ground. "

24:59.999 --> 25:03.418
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. "

25:05.629 --> 25:08.590
Murphy's henchmen
have to be brought in.

25:08.674 --> 25:11.968
I'm going to take it to court
and bring Murphy down.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.971
Have you talked to Sheriff Brady?

25:18.934 --> 25:20.643
You're the justice of the peace.

25:20.728 --> 25:23.646
You can serve warrants
through special constables.

25:23.731 --> 25:29.903
What special constables? No one's fool
enough to go after Murphy's people.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.780
Deputise them.

25:32.781 --> 25:35.658
Those are just boys.
Ain't one of 'em over 21.

25:35.659 --> 25:39.162
- Murphy's men will shred 'em in half.
- Will you deputise them?

25:39.246 --> 25:42.707
Hell, no. No, I won't, Alex.

25:44.793 --> 25:47.212
Not me.

25:47.296 --> 25:50.298
All right, then. You go tell 'em.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.877
Lugar peligroso.

26:27.962 --> 26:31.422
- Bad medicine, my friends.
- You got that right.

26:31.507 --> 26:35.718
- You grew up in a hole worse than that.
- Yeah, but I've been cultured since.

26:35.803 --> 26:39.722
OK. Henry Hill's been in there
with a lady since noon.

26:39.807 --> 26:42.934
We'll show him the warrant,
take him home.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.937
Yeah. Yeah. We gotta take him.

26:46.355 --> 26:48.690
I'd say we do.

26:51.694 --> 26:54.112
Hey, uh, Billy?

26:54.196 --> 26:57.657
Why don't you go inside
and have a look-see?

27:01.120 --> 27:06.249
Go on, Billy. See if Hill's in there.
If he is, bring him to us.

27:26.312 --> 27:29.230
Yeah, give me two cards.

27:34.403 --> 27:37.322
- I'll take two.
- Hey, Hill, want another drink?

27:37.406 --> 27:41.117
Got to drain it first.
I'll have Janey here give me a hand.

27:41.118 --> 27:43.286
Doc says not to lift nothing too heavy.

27:47.207 --> 27:50.793
You talk to me like that, Henry Hill.

27:58.761 --> 28:01.054
Now what the hell's he doin'?

28:04.266 --> 28:06.559
Get up.

28:12.191 --> 28:15.735
Ah. Oh, Lord.

28:21.658 --> 28:23.826
- Henry Hill?
- Yeah?

28:26.789 --> 28:28.122
Howdy.

28:32.419 --> 28:34.003
Oh, God.

28:34.088 --> 28:35.713
Shit!

28:40.094 --> 28:43.471
By the way, you're under arrest.

28:49.686 --> 28:50.728
Shit!

29:03.742 --> 29:05.118
Oh, shit!

29:33.272 --> 29:36.023
Bonney! You weren't supposed
to smoke anybody!

29:36.024 --> 29:38.651
We got warrants! We're the law!

29:44.032 --> 29:46.701
"Nine men lay dead
or at death's door

29:46.785 --> 29:50.204
following a gunfight
between Henry Hill, 45,

29:50.289 --> 29:52.582
and what patrons called a kid. "

29:52.666 --> 29:55.710
"A local miner identified the kid
as one Henry McCarty,

29:55.794 --> 29:59.297
also known as William H Bonney,
19 or 20."

29:59.381 --> 30:04.552
"The kid, Billy, killed Mr Hill, then took
on an onslaught of Hill partisans,

30:04.636 --> 30:07.597
bringing the damage
to six verified slayings. "

30:07.598 --> 30:11.309
"Bonney is believed to be captain
of a deputised gang. "

30:11.393 --> 30:12.935
Captain?

30:13.020 --> 30:17.064
How come it don't say nothin'
about the two I got?

30:20.277 --> 30:23.237
El Chivato. Billy the Kid, huh?

30:23.322 --> 30:27.783
Murphy's going to want blood,
brains and balls for this.

30:27.784 --> 30:29.911
- I'm getting out of here.
- Hey, Doc.

30:29.995 --> 30:33.164
Don't be stupid.
You know they'll be looking for us.

30:33.248 --> 30:36.667
Yeah, I know.
I'll be back in one minute.

30:40.631 --> 30:42.882
Howdy.

30:43.425 --> 30:48.012
- I cannot accept those. Thank you.
- You walk awful fast for a little thing.

30:48.096 --> 30:50.264
Come on, Yen, I just want to talk.

30:50.349 --> 30:53.976
- You must like trouble.
- You think I look like trouble?

30:53.977 --> 30:56.646
I'm a poet carrying flowers,
of all things.

30:56.730 --> 30:58.648
And a gun. It's a big gun.

30:58.649 --> 31:02.276
It's a big town.
Come on, Yen, please.

31:04.780 --> 31:06.864
Stop!

31:09.076 --> 31:12.662
Look. If you don't want to take these,
that's fine.

31:12.746 --> 31:14.956
But you take a message
to your guardian.

31:14.957 --> 31:21.295
You tell LG Murphy
the regulators are going to clean house.

31:21.296 --> 31:27.802
They can't own us like they own
a little China girl for the price of a shirt.

31:28.345 --> 31:30.680
You tell him that.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.061
Yen, I'm sorry.

31:51.034 --> 31:53.202
So, Dick...

31:54.329 --> 31:56.497
who's next?

31:57.874 --> 31:59.083
You.

32:11.638 --> 32:13.931
- Shit.
- What's wrong?

32:14.016 --> 32:17.226
I mean I found some. Horseshit.

32:17.227 --> 32:20.271
They come down
from the Sierra Bonitas this morning.

32:20.355 --> 32:26.277
Horses been grazin' wild. Pretty damn
good, don't you think, Baker?

32:34.161 --> 32:36.954
Not that good.

32:37.039 --> 32:39.707
- Buenos dias, shitheads.
- Up.

32:39.708 --> 32:42.752
By killing Henry Hill,
you started a war.

32:42.836 --> 32:46.213
By killing Mr Tunstall,
y'all started the damn war.

32:46.214 --> 32:50.718
Just the same, we're talking 50, 60 men
against your... what? Six or seven?

32:50.719 --> 32:55.097
- We're with the ring, Dick.
- We're going to bury you.

32:55.098 --> 32:58.392
Quiet, Bonney.
We're taking you to jail. No killing.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.645
Objection, Your Honour.

33:00.729 --> 33:03.481
These boys are going to the grave.

33:03.565 --> 33:07.735
I said quiet! I don't need that kind
of talk. The law don't talk like that.

33:07.736 --> 33:11.238
- The law don't kill innocent merchants.
- Shut up, dirt face.

33:15.327 --> 33:16.327
Uh-huh!

33:16.411 --> 33:19.789
Hey, Billy, easy.

33:22.084 --> 33:25.711
Dick, we shouldn't go
by way of South Fork.

33:26.880 --> 33:30.758
- Why's that?
- I think Murphy will ambush us there.

33:43.563 --> 33:45.940
Hey.

33:47.275 --> 33:49.527
- What?
- I saw that.

33:49.611 --> 33:51.779
What? What did you see?

33:51.863 --> 33:55.783
- He knows what I just saw!
- What you talkin' about?

33:55.784 --> 34:00.830
Where's the ambush? In Lincoln?
You're steering us away from Capitan

34:00.831 --> 34:04.709
cos your men - Murphy's men -
are waiting to jump us in Lincoln.

34:04.793 --> 34:08.504
Billy, McCloskey's with us.
He's a regulator.

34:08.588 --> 34:12.007
- He used to ride with Murphy!
- That was a long time ago.

34:12.092 --> 34:15.010
- He's a spy!
- He's been with us. We made a pact.

34:15.094 --> 34:17.679
- Right, McCloskey?
- Right.

34:17.764 --> 34:19.974
Jesus, Billy.

34:23.978 --> 34:26.355
Come on.

34:38.201 --> 34:40.494
Ah, shit. I'm sorry, McCloskey.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.080
It's all right.
We're all upset about John.

34:43.165 --> 34:45.833
I'm sorry I didn't
sniff you out sooner, traitor!

34:45.833 --> 34:46.958
Billy!

34:49.337 --> 34:51.505
- Oh, shit!
- Billy!

34:51.505 --> 34:54.175
Billy, what the hell...? Jesus!

35:05.687 --> 35:07.897
Hold your fire!

35:07.981 --> 35:10.524
- Halt!
- Shit!

35:10.609 --> 35:13.277
No!

35:15.822 --> 35:20.117
- Hold your goddamn fire!
- Get that son of a bitch!

35:22.913 --> 35:25.247
Oh, God!

35:30.337 --> 35:34.882
- Court adjourned.
- Moron! You're out of line!

35:34.966 --> 35:38.552
He was right.
McCloskey was acting strange.

35:38.637 --> 35:41.722
Then we just killed
three more Murphy men! Right?

35:41.723 --> 35:43.390
- Right.
- Oh, Christ!

35:43.391 --> 35:46.602
- Brady's going to hang us for sure!
- What do we do now?

35:46.686 --> 35:51.899
Everybody close their fargin' lips
for a second and let me think!

35:51.983 --> 35:54.276
We better skin out of here.

35:55.737 --> 35:59.406
OK, everybody,
skin up the river. Now!

36:01.910 --> 36:05.579
You! You better stop
believing the newspapers.

36:05.580 --> 36:10.000
You ain't no captain, and you sure
as hell ain't no Robin Hood.

36:10.085 --> 36:12.670
Whatever you say, Dick.

36:13.547 --> 36:15.798
Get that idiot on a horse.

36:51.668 --> 36:56.630
"Advices from Lincoln say the young
lad of iron nerve and marvellous skill

37:01.428 --> 37:04.805
including a miraculous
shot of 50 yards. "

37:04.806 --> 37:10.978
There's a picture here.
It says "Billy the Kid" but it ain't Billy.

37:10.979 --> 37:13.480
Let me see that.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.067
Well, that's me.

37:18.153 --> 37:22.615
That's bullshit.
Papers can't get anything right.

37:24.784 --> 37:29.538
"Sources say that the kid,
a left-hander, is tall, handsome,

37:29.623 --> 37:33.208
and unequalled in the elements
that appeal to the holier emotions. "

37:33.293 --> 37:35.878
Jesus, this country needs a hero!

37:35.879 --> 37:41.508
"Murphy has hired none other than
John Kinney and his DoÃ±a Ana bunch

37:41.593 --> 37:44.428
to hunt down Billy the Kid
and the gang. "

37:44.512 --> 37:46.889
Oh, great. John Kinney.

37:46.890 --> 37:48.849
Who's Kinney?

37:48.850 --> 37:51.518
It says he's an ex-soldier
who suffered an injury

37:51.603 --> 37:53.687
and is now a bounty hunter.

37:53.772 --> 37:58.150
- What's that mean?
- It means he can whoop some ass.

38:14.125 --> 38:16.919
- Hey, Doc. Come here for a minute?
- Yeah.

38:25.053 --> 38:26.887
Read the rest.

38:26.888 --> 38:30.265
- What's up?
- We can't go north.

38:43.488 --> 38:48.575
We can go through the Valley of Fires,
but there's the Mescalero reservation.

38:48.660 --> 38:52.913
They're having a good year with scalps.
I don't think so.

38:52.998 --> 38:56.250
I don't know what the hell to do.

38:56.251 --> 38:58.585
What the hell's he doin'?

39:05.427 --> 39:08.762
We've come to a place
where we are lost.

39:08.847 --> 39:12.599
When an Indian is lost, he reaches
into the spirit world to find the way.

39:18.440 --> 39:22.276
We're lost right now,
but I'll find us the way.

39:22.277 --> 39:28.032
Oh, Christ! That's all we need,
more red-ass Navajo mambojahambo.

39:28.116 --> 39:31.493
We're running out of time here, Chavez.

39:37.042 --> 39:38.959
Is that any good?

39:41.087 --> 39:43.464
Chavez, what is that?

39:43.465 --> 39:45.841
Peyote.

40:01.066 --> 40:03.067
Dick?

40:27.008 --> 40:29.009
Butterflies.

40:32.555 --> 40:34.556
Yeah.

40:34.641 --> 40:36.975
Just like a butterfly.

40:38.812 --> 40:43.607
Butterfly flies to a flower,

40:43.691 --> 40:45.859
stays with it.

40:48.571 --> 40:51.073
It doesn't know why,

40:51.074 --> 40:53.242
it just feels it.

40:54.786 --> 40:56.787
Oh, yeah.

40:57.747 --> 40:59.748
She's...

41:05.588 --> 41:08.757
She's my flower.

41:08.842 --> 41:11.593
I'm her...

41:14.514 --> 41:19.393
Did you guys see the size
of that chicken?

41:47.297 --> 41:49.923
We don't know why.

41:49.924 --> 41:52.301
We just feel it.

41:54.637 --> 41:57.306
Oh, God!

41:57.390 --> 42:00.225
You guys! You guys!

42:16.284 --> 42:19.661
This is great.

42:19.746 --> 42:22.414
This is great!

42:23.791 --> 42:29.796
Did you see the size of that
cock-a-doodle-goddamned-do?

42:42.810 --> 42:46.146
That's real. That's real!

42:56.157 --> 42:58.951
I'm her butterfly. She's mine!

43:00.161 --> 43:04.998
Regulators, saddle up!

43:05.083 --> 43:08.252
Godless heathens.

43:14.384 --> 43:17.094
Regulators!

43:25.561 --> 43:28.063
Hey, Doc, Doc!

43:28.064 --> 43:31.400
Did you see the size
of that chicken?

43:33.194 --> 43:36.280
? Gather 'round the coal house, babe

43:36.364 --> 43:39.741
? Two hands 'round and go again

43:39.826 --> 43:44.371
? Allemande left
and a turn to your partner

43:44.789 --> 43:46.790
Howdy.

43:48.376 --> 43:50.711
How are you, sir?

43:55.550 --> 43:58.552
Hey, Chavez,
how come they ain't killin' us?

43:58.636 --> 44:04.599
Cos we're in the spirit world,
asshole! They can't see us!

44:04.684 --> 44:08.520
? There's the girl
with the golden hair...

44:14.569 --> 44:18.196
Hey, did you know
we're in the spirit world?

44:40.678 --> 44:44.598
Lord, forgive us
for our wrongdoings,

44:44.682 --> 44:48.435
for our misguidance
by heathen religions.

44:49.562 --> 44:52.272
Thank you for keeping us alive.

44:55.026 --> 44:58.278
Please guide us
in doing the right thing.

45:00.948 --> 45:02.783
Oh! Ow!

45:02.784 --> 45:05.827
Our Father, who art in heaven,

45:07.997 --> 45:11.124
Please, Dick, it's getting cold!

45:13.086 --> 45:15.962
I could've killed you, Dick.

45:16.047 --> 45:22.511
I could've killed you...
but I don't want to kill you. I want to eat.

45:22.512 --> 45:25.180
When we've finished this meal,
you rodent,

45:25.264 --> 45:29.309
we're going outside to see
who has the right to run the regulators.

45:29.394 --> 45:34.564
Richard, would you be so kind
as to pass the gravy, please?

45:35.024 --> 45:38.485
- Mighty well-heeled man coming.
- Just one?

45:40.238 --> 45:43.490
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, Lord, it's Buckshot Roberts!

45:44.742 --> 45:48.537
- We got a warrant for him.
- Is he coming to surrender?

45:49.205 --> 45:53.250
- Don't look that way.
- He any good?

45:54.001 --> 45:57.546
He's killed more people
than smallpox.

46:02.844 --> 46:05.262
Well, hell, introduce us.

46:28.202 --> 46:30.370
We got a warrant for you, old man.

46:30.371 --> 46:35.375
I ain't got no business with that war
no more, peckerhead son of a bitch.

46:35.460 --> 46:41.381
I'm on my own. I'm here to get that $150
Sheriff Brady's putting down for the kid.

46:41.466 --> 46:45.302
The rest of you little shits
is only worth 110, but I'll take it.

46:45.386 --> 46:48.054
What a sweet disposition.

46:50.183 --> 46:52.142
Let's dance.

46:59.108 --> 47:01.109
Chavez!

47:05.740 --> 47:08.658
Argh! Ah, shit!

47:08.743 --> 47:10.494
Damn.

47:14.540 --> 47:16.500
Chavez?

47:16.584 --> 47:18.710
What?

47:20.087 --> 47:23.924
- You little sons of bitches!
- Go into the shitter.

47:23.925 --> 47:28.094
- What?
- Billy, go in there and cut him in half.

47:32.683 --> 47:34.893
I'm daring you, Billy.

47:40.441 --> 47:43.235
Y'all can't blast me!

47:46.948 --> 47:49.449
Screw that!

48:16.435 --> 48:18.478
Cover me.

48:33.327 --> 48:36.121
Dick!

48:43.963 --> 48:47.382
Son of a bitch!
Dick, we're coming to get you!

48:47.466 --> 48:50.385
He's dead, Charley.

48:50.386 --> 48:53.430
We got to go get him!
We got to go get him!

48:53.514 --> 48:56.516
You want to cross
in front of that shithouse again?

48:56.601 --> 48:59.603
What are we gonna do?
Dick got his guts blown out!

48:59.687 --> 49:03.356
- He's our foreman!
- Come on.

49:03.441 --> 49:08.903
- Doc, what are we going to do?
- Get the hell out of here!

49:08.988 --> 49:11.072
Come on, Charley!

49:11.073 --> 49:14.576
Regulators! Let's rack out now!

49:15.703 --> 49:17.287
OK!

50:25.439 --> 50:29.818
- Where to, Doc?
- I'm going into Patricio if it looks safe.

50:29.902 --> 50:34.781
I'll write Dick's mother in Vermont,
get some clean wraps for this.

50:34.782 --> 50:37.534
Well, whatever you do,
don't go near Lincoln.

50:37.618 --> 50:39.786
See you.

51:02.309 --> 51:04.728
What you doin' there, Billy?

51:04.812 --> 51:07.313
Well, sir,

51:07.314 --> 51:09.691
with the sight filed down,

51:09.775 --> 51:14.654
I got an eighth-of-a-second drop
on our good Sheriff Brady.

51:18.492 --> 51:23.204
Billy, we can't touch the sheriff.
Dick said so. You know that.

51:23.289 --> 51:25.915
Besides, we can't keep this up.

51:26.000 --> 51:30.003
Well, Dick ain't around any more,
is he, Charley?

51:30.087 --> 51:33.381
Brady's in desperate need
of being removed from office.

51:33.466 --> 51:36.384
We're not going after Brady.

51:36.469 --> 51:39.721
No Murphy men. No more.

51:39.805 --> 51:42.557
I told you I would find the way,
and the way is west.

51:42.641 --> 51:45.351
West, huh?

51:45.352 --> 51:48.354
West is that way,

51:48.439 --> 51:51.232
and the bastards we got to kill
are that way.

51:51.317 --> 51:54.903
The only bastards going to get killed
are us, Chivato. Let it go.

51:54.904 --> 51:59.282
Let it go? Murphy's taking inventory
in Tunstall's store right now!

51:59.366 --> 52:01.951
That means nothing to you?

52:06.916 --> 52:09.250
It means nothing to me?

52:12.171 --> 52:15.256
Murphy and his politicians
have taken more blood from me

52:15.341 --> 52:17.217
than they ever will from you.

52:17.218 --> 52:19.552
Oh, yeah?
How do you figure?

52:19.970 --> 52:22.931
The Red Sand Creek Reservation.

52:23.766 --> 52:26.100
- What's he talking about?
- I don't know.

52:31.732 --> 52:34.567
My mother's people.

52:35.402 --> 52:39.239
Murphy and Company was under
contract to supply us with beef.

52:39.323 --> 52:42.909
Two winters ago,
he sent only rotten meat.

52:42.993 --> 52:46.579
No corn, no flour, only rancid beef
crawling with worms.

52:46.580 --> 52:50.250
So I went out with a band
to a trader's camp to try and get food.

52:50.334 --> 52:54.838
Oh, yeah, they welcomed us in,
and then they opened fire on us.

52:54.922 --> 52:57.257
I got away - only me!

52:58.217 --> 53:01.761
But when I got back to the Red Sands,

53:01.846 --> 53:06.140
I found out that the army had already
heard about our "big Indian uprising".

53:06.225 --> 53:08.101
And they paid us back.

53:08.185 --> 53:12.272
My mother was cut by a sabre
from her privates to her neck.

53:12.356 --> 53:16.860
My sisters were just babies. They had
their heads bashed in with boot heels

53:16.944 --> 53:20.280
so the army could save bullets!

53:20.281 --> 53:22.615
Everybody on my reservation
was butchered.

53:22.616 --> 53:25.285
And it means nothing to me?!

53:27.454 --> 53:32.625
Oh, yeah, I went to Lincoln
to take Murphy's head,

53:33.043 --> 53:36.838
and that's when
John Tunstall found me.

53:36.922 --> 53:42.510
And he took me in, and he taught me
a better way to bury Murphy.

53:42.595 --> 53:46.014
Murphy buried him
the old Irish way, Chavez.

53:46.015 --> 53:48.182
That's right, Steve.

53:49.435 --> 53:51.978
And he starved out your family, Chavez.

53:52.062 --> 53:56.691
Now he's doing it to every small farmer
in the territory.

53:56.775 --> 54:00.528
But you wanna run, go ahead.
Just go right on ahead.

54:01.280 --> 54:04.032
Bye. You got no loyalty, Navajo.

54:04.033 --> 54:05.575
Navajo!

54:06.827 --> 54:10.246
He ain't nothin' but a piece
of chickenshit in the rain.

54:10.331 --> 54:12.498
No.

54:12.499 --> 54:16.586
We had our ceremony
back there on the ridge, Chivato.

54:16.670 --> 54:19.380
Now, I don't know
what your vision told you,

54:19.381 --> 54:23.760
but mine told me we're headed
for blood, blood like a river.

54:23.844 --> 54:28.723
I'm the last of my clan,
the last of my people.

54:28.724 --> 54:34.145
If I die, and I'm not afraid of dying,
the sacred hoop is broken.

54:36.273 --> 54:40.693
Now I have to go west
to make my people live again.

54:52.539 --> 54:54.582
Charley...

54:54.667 --> 54:57.001
will you come with me?

55:02.967 --> 55:06.219
You ain't sayin' much, Dirty Steve.

55:06.303 --> 55:09.055
Cos he ain't got much to say,
Charley.

55:09.056 --> 55:13.559
Old Steve understands the meaning
of the word "pals", don't you, Steve?

55:13.644 --> 55:18.773
See, you got three or four good pals,
then you got yourself a tribe.

55:18.857 --> 55:21.401
There ain't nothing
stronger than that.

55:21.402 --> 55:24.779
We're your family now, Chavez.

55:24.780 --> 55:29.575
You walk away from us,
you break our sacred hoop.

55:29.660 --> 55:32.954
We got to stick together, fellas.

55:32.955 --> 55:35.373
That's the only way I see it.

55:51.932 --> 55:55.977
# When Irish eyes are smiling

55:55.978 --> 55:58.938
# Sure, it's like a morning spring

55:59.023 --> 56:02.692
# In the lilt of Irish laughter

56:02.776 --> 56:06.612
# You can hear the angels sing

56:13.704 --> 56:19.459
# But when Irish eyes are smiling

56:32.306 --> 56:34.974
It's me - Doc. OK? Shh!

56:42.232 --> 56:47.195
I know you've come to lay with me
then cut me into tiny pieces!

56:47.196 --> 56:50.490
You're the bandit
who eats children and old people!

56:50.491 --> 56:53.534
I eat meat and potatoes.
Who told you that?

56:54.661 --> 56:56.412
My benefactor.

56:56.497 --> 57:00.208
Your benefactor?
That's the man that eats people.

57:05.422 --> 57:10.176
Yen, if you want to stay here,
tell me now, and I'll go.

57:10.177 --> 57:12.929
Do you want to stay here?

57:14.973 --> 57:18.893
In China, girls are not necessary.
When we have floods,

57:18.894 --> 57:23.356
fathers let the girl babies wash by.
My benefactor has made me necessary.

57:23.440 --> 57:27.693
He hasn't made you necessary.
He's made you a slave!

57:27.778 --> 57:30.488
I'm sorry.

57:31.573 --> 57:36.911
Necessary is something
you can't do without.

57:36.995 --> 57:39.038
I can't do without you.

57:42.543 --> 57:45.878
I keep the flowers that you offered me

57:45.879 --> 57:49.715
in a little room inside my head...

57:56.056 --> 57:58.808
Often, I say yes.

57:58.892 --> 58:02.228
I want to ask
something else of you now.

58:02.312 --> 58:05.273
I want you to go with me to Roswell.

58:05.732 --> 58:08.067
There's a railroad
going to New York City.

58:08.152 --> 58:13.072
Two days, we could be on a train,
in another country, in a city together.

58:16.827 --> 58:21.747
"The Bird", by Josiah G Scurlock.
That's Doc.

58:21.748 --> 58:24.667
"Once upon a midnight dreary,

58:24.751 --> 58:27.253
as I pondered weak and weary,

58:27.337 --> 58:31.674
there came a knocking
at my... back porch. "

58:33.927 --> 58:36.304
Ain't very original, is he?

58:39.349 --> 58:42.852
He's been gone an awful long time.

58:42.936 --> 58:47.106
I have a feeling
he's gonna be makin' a run for it.

58:48.233 --> 58:50.318
Who? Doc?

58:50.319 --> 58:53.279
Nah, Doc likes me.

58:58.368 --> 59:03.623
If I stay, I'll be a stiff in a photograph.
The only chance I have is to run.

59:03.624 --> 59:07.001
- They would chase us.
- I'm used to that.

59:09.338 --> 59:11.172
No.

59:11.256 --> 59:14.508
I am unclean.
That is not for a young man.

59:14.593 --> 59:19.805
Yen, I used to ride with the Dirty
Underwear Gang of Liberty, Missouri.

59:19.890 --> 59:24.310
Then John Tunstall taught me
the past is like an old yellow novel.

59:24.311 --> 59:30.274
When you're finished with it,
you toss it out and start a new one.

59:31.568 --> 59:32.860
OK?

59:39.785 --> 59:42.828
You're necessary.

59:45.332 --> 59:48.376
- Go with me. Come with me, Yen.
- No.

59:48.460 --> 59:50.211
Yen Sun!

59:52.965 --> 59:55.716
Yen Sun!

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:20.950
- Hey, Steve!
- What?

01:00:21.034 --> 01:00:25.496
Doc's back.
I told you he'd come back.

01:00:26.039 --> 01:00:29.375
Regulators, let's saddle up!

01:00:31.044 --> 01:00:33.921
Sheriff Brady,

01:00:34.006 --> 01:00:36.132
we're gonna have a lot of fun now.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.436
What the hell's he doin'?

01:00:50.605 --> 01:00:53.274
He ain't all there, is he?

01:00:54.568 --> 01:00:56.736
Is he?

01:01:03.744 --> 01:01:06.746
Top o' the mornin' to you, girls.

01:01:39.946 --> 01:01:43.032
Reap the whirlwind,
Sheriff Brady.

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:46.160
Reap it!

01:01:50.415 --> 01:01:52.958
- It's for you.
- You weren't to touch Brady!

01:01:53.085 --> 01:01:55.669
Sheriff Brady sent the men
who killed John.

01:01:55.754 --> 01:01:57.838
- It was a good move for us.
- It wasn't.

01:01:57.839 --> 01:02:00.674
- Yes, it was!
- Have you seen The Independent?

01:02:00.675 --> 01:02:02.968
The governor's revoked
your deputisation.

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:06.806
You're wanted by the legitimate law
as well as those outside the law.

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:10.976
You're being hunted by John Kinney,
Murphy's men, and troops!

01:02:10.977 --> 01:02:13.312
Fort Stanton, Billy! The US Army.

01:02:13.397 --> 01:02:17.316
The governor's put
a $200 bounty on your head.

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:21.695
You were supposed to serve
11 warrants and expose the ring.

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:24.824
Instead, you went on the warpath,
on a rampage.

01:02:24.825 --> 01:02:27.993
Now Richard's dead.
We're livin' up here like fugitives.

01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:30.579
What the hell
do you think you're doin'?

01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:33.499
I don't know.

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:35.584
Maybe I'm tryin' to get some attention,

01:02:35.669 --> 01:02:38.921
or to get President Hayes
to look this way.

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:43.384
They let Murphy and his bankers get
away with anything. I can't allow that.

01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:46.679
The more bastards I dust,
the more news stories they write.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.722
The more troops they send after us,

01:02:48.807 --> 01:02:55.521
the more President Hayes has to come
down, see for himself what's going on.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:03:00.234
Then he'll find out
who's really doing the killing.

01:03:04.156 --> 01:03:06.407
Alex.

01:03:06.491 --> 01:03:08.826
What are you gonna do?

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:14.457
I'm gonna try to reach
the president myself, legally.

01:03:14.541 --> 01:03:17.418
It won't be easy
to get past the governor.

01:03:17.419 --> 01:03:19.086
I got plans for the governor.

01:03:19.171 --> 01:03:22.465
What if you can't get in touch
with Hayes?

01:03:24.759 --> 01:03:27.970
I'll go back to Lincoln
and reopen John's store.

01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:32.475
- That's what John would want.
- We'll escort you.

01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:37.396
You'd be a death sentence to anyone
now, Billy. I don't want your help.

01:03:39.274 --> 01:03:42.401
You didn't see
what they did to John.

01:03:43.403 --> 01:03:45.571
We did.

01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:56.457
Christ, Billy.

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:01.795
Thank you, Billy.

01:04:01.796 --> 01:04:04.089
Billy, please, go to Old Mexico.

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:06.175
Please.

01:04:20.941 --> 01:04:23.651
Gentlemen, let's ride.

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:47.466
- Alex...
- What the hell happened, Doc?

01:04:49.469 --> 01:04:51.845
It is a whirlwind out there.

01:04:53.765 --> 01:04:56.684
When you're in it,
you can't get out.

01:04:56.685 --> 01:04:58.852
I'm sorry.

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:04.567
I was wonderin'
if you remember that China doll -

01:05:04.651 --> 01:05:07.945
you know, at the dance...
the fandango?

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:11.824
I was sort of thinkin',
cos you're a lawyer and all,

01:05:11.825 --> 01:05:14.076
maybe there was a legal way...

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:20.583
I don't even have enough ground
to stand on any more, Doc. I mean it.

01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:22.835
OK. Yeah.

01:05:24.546 --> 01:05:26.547
Thanks.

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:31.552
Take care of yourself, Alex.

01:05:31.553 --> 01:05:33.304
OK?

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:44.106
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:48.694
He's just bellyachin'
about somethin' or another.

01:05:51.573 --> 01:05:53.907
He got mighty spooked.

01:05:57.912 --> 01:06:02.541
Dirty Steve told me, Billy. He told me
what they're writin' in the papers.

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:07.129
Steven told him about the party
Sheriff Peppin's plannin' for us.

01:06:07.213 --> 01:06:09.548
Party?
Oh, you mean the hangin'.

01:06:09.633 --> 01:06:11.091
CÃ¡llate, Chivato.

01:06:11.176 --> 01:06:14.094
Goddammit, Billy!

01:06:14.763 --> 01:06:17.097
You ever seen a man hanged?

01:06:17.182 --> 01:06:20.893
His face turns purple,
and his eyes come up on him.

01:06:20.894 --> 01:06:23.062
I seen Red Smitty hang.

01:06:26.566 --> 01:06:29.985
Billy. I don't think Charley
wants to hear about Red Smitty.

01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:34.782
I think what he'd like to hear
is that we're not going to hang.

01:06:34.866 --> 01:06:37.826
You mess your trousers, they say.

01:06:37.911 --> 01:06:40.579
Gals watchin' and everything.

01:06:41.581 --> 01:06:45.709
Well, if we get caught, Charley,
we're gonna hang.

01:06:48.046 --> 01:06:51.507
But there's many a slip
'twixt a cup and a lip.

01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:57.971
We got to do somethin'
before they catch us.

01:06:58.890 --> 01:07:02.184
Y'all got to let me do somethin'.

01:07:03.186 --> 01:07:04.269
OK, Charley.

01:07:34.134 --> 01:07:35.968
Charley, this is your last wish?

01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:38.804
Get your carrot wet?
You could do that in JuÃ¡rez.

01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:43.267
Somethin' called a special woman, dirt
face. You'll understand that one day.

01:07:49.649 --> 01:07:54.403
All right, gentlemen,
square up and shell out for Bowdre.

01:07:56.489 --> 01:07:58.490
We'll be in the den.

01:07:58.491 --> 01:08:03.203
- Yell if you need any help.
- You know what to do, don't you?

01:08:23.308 --> 01:08:25.684
What's your name?

01:08:25.685 --> 01:08:28.562
Charley.

01:08:28.645 --> 01:08:31.523
Well, Charley,

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:34.526
I don't remember you
but I guess you remember me.

01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:39.406
I meet so many young men
out for the first. You know how it is.

01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:43.702
Why don't you come over here,
Charley?

01:08:46.706 --> 01:08:49.291
Uh, ma'am,

01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:51.710
I just want to hold you.

01:08:54.798 --> 01:08:57.716
Whatever your pleasure, Charley,

01:08:57.716 --> 01:09:00.051
but it all costs the same.

01:09:26.287 --> 01:09:29.081
Darlin', when a man rides
200 miles for a job,

01:09:29.082 --> 01:09:33.502
you can bet
he's gonna get that job done.

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:37.798
If this Billy the Kid's
around town like people say,

01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:40.551
he is $200 flat dead on this bar.

01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:44.638
You can't kill what you can't catch.

01:09:44.721 --> 01:09:47.015
These mestizos,

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.935
they say that Billito's half horse,

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:52.187
half devil.

01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:58.944
But who knows? Maybe a strong,
big Texas man like you can do...

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:00.821
You gonna kill Billy the Kid?

01:10:00.822 --> 01:10:04.449
Does a horse piss
where she pleases?

01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:06.952
If he's man enough
to come around here.

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:10.122
Is that the gun
you're gonna shoot him down with?

01:10:10.123 --> 01:10:12.332
Can I touch it?

01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:14.334
Please?

01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:18.338
You know, sir, I do admire you,

01:10:18.339 --> 01:10:23.510
and I sure would like to touch the gun
that's gonna kill Billy the Kid.

01:10:23.595 --> 01:10:26.305
- You know iron, boy?
- Yes, sir.

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:31.184
Go ahead, then.

01:10:31.185 --> 01:10:33.562
Have a look.

01:10:35.315 --> 01:10:37.858
Pass her back.
That gun killed Ed Rollins.

01:10:37.859 --> 01:10:39.359
Is that right?

01:10:40.904 --> 01:10:45.908
Let's have a little round of stone fence
for every little lady in the house.

01:10:46.659 --> 01:10:48.577
OK. Pass it back, son.

01:10:48.661 --> 01:10:54.207
Stroke a gun like that, you might as well
be strokin' a man's woman. Pass it up.

01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:56.710
Whoop!

01:10:59.923 --> 01:11:03.383
All right. Now, you best be on your way
before you get hurt.

01:11:03.468 --> 01:11:05.594
Uh, I'm leavin' right now,

01:11:05.678 --> 01:11:09.556
and I wanna know what to look for
in case I run into him.

01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:15.395
Dresses like a dandy,
and he's a left-hander.

01:11:15.396 --> 01:11:19.441
People say he's fond
of whistlin' sad ballads.

01:11:20.234 --> 01:11:24.446
Now, you get out in the street
and see somebody that fits that bill,

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:26.823
you just come whisperin' to me.

01:11:27.325 --> 01:11:29.034
OK.

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:31.119
Bye-bye.

01:11:35.917 --> 01:11:38.085
Hey! I see him!

01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:42.297
Right there!
Don't you see him?

01:11:44.926 --> 01:11:47.886
Is that so, now?

01:11:47.887 --> 01:11:52.099
You know, boy,
I'm gettin' a little tired of your wise lip.

01:11:54.936 --> 01:11:59.106
Before I have to drop your britches
in front of all these fine ladies

01:11:59.107 --> 01:12:02.067
and spank your little bottom blue.

01:12:12.453 --> 01:12:15.288
Yeah, sure.
You are a testy little cuss.

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:42.607
Hey, Doc, how many
does that make? 25?

01:12:43.443 --> 01:12:45.402
Five.

01:12:46.154 --> 01:12:50.449
We'll call it ten, ten even.
How'd that be?

01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:52.617
Whatever you say.

01:12:54.579 --> 01:12:56.496
It's John Kinney!

01:13:33.367 --> 01:13:35.368
Come on!

01:13:41.167 --> 01:13:43.168
God!

01:14:06.025 --> 01:14:07.025
Where are they?

01:14:10.029 --> 01:14:12.572
"His hat was covered
with gold and jewels. "

01:14:12.573 --> 01:14:17.077
"It sparkled in a dazzling, blinding
manner when one looked upon it. "

01:14:18.329 --> 01:14:21.665
I know, I know.
It breaks my heart, too.

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:26.545
"The shoes worn by this young,
left-handed prince of the plains

01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:31.216
were low-quartered with patterned
silver spurs in the heels. "

01:14:31.217 --> 01:14:33.552
I ain't left-handed.

01:14:34.554 --> 01:14:36.304
Billy,

01:14:36.389 --> 01:14:38.765
I was thinkin' about our course.

01:14:38.850 --> 01:14:42.227
It looks like we've just done
a big circle twice.

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:44.104
And?

01:14:44.105 --> 01:14:47.315
It also looks like
we're going back into Lincoln.

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.568
We are.

01:14:52.572 --> 01:14:56.658
- Ain't a good idea, Billy.
- Billy, what are you thinkin'?

01:14:56.742 --> 01:15:00.829
Billy, we're lucky to be alive.
Goin' back to Lincoln, that's crazy.

01:15:00.913 --> 01:15:04.916
- We'll find the men who killed John.
- It's 100 against five!

01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:07.252
"It's 100 against five!"

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:09.754
We take Murphy, and the ring falls.

01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:14.426
We take him, we win this war.
Then it'll be over.

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:17.679
- Can't get to him, Billy.
- It's not just 100 men.

01:15:17.763 --> 01:15:21.933
There's bounty hunters, too,
everywhere we go... but not west.

01:15:24.937 --> 01:15:28.773
I chose your way,
but I don't trust it any more.

01:15:35.114 --> 01:15:38.366
California sounds about right to me.

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:42.495
You're all scared.

01:15:48.002 --> 01:15:50.837
- And you're gonna fail the test.
- What test?

01:15:50.838 --> 01:15:53.298
You have to test yourself every day.

01:15:53.299 --> 01:15:57.177
Once you stop testin' yourself,
you get slow.

01:15:57.261 --> 01:16:00.722
When that happens, they kill you.

01:16:03.226 --> 01:16:05.143
You fellas don't feel that?

01:16:06.354 --> 01:16:09.231
Like when John Kinney's
riding up on our ass

01:16:09.315 --> 01:16:11.650
and the blood goes
right to your head?

01:16:14.779 --> 01:16:18.031
- It's quite a sensation.
- Yeah, I bet it is.

01:16:18.032 --> 01:16:21.159
I'm sure you hear trumpets sound
and angels sing a hymn.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.161
I shit in my goddamn britches!

01:16:23.246 --> 01:16:26.665
OK? We've taken enough
goddamn Murphy scalps!

01:16:26.666 --> 01:16:30.252
We cannot win this war,
not the five of us.

01:16:31.504 --> 01:16:33.672
Do you understand?

01:16:33.756 --> 01:16:35.006
No.

01:16:35.007 --> 01:16:39.761
Billy, you want to get
the president's attention, go ahead.

01:16:40.888 --> 01:16:43.515
You want to keep testing yourself?
Fine.

01:16:48.062 --> 01:16:50.689
Come morning, I'm a Mexican.

01:16:51.482 --> 01:16:53.984
Yeah, Billy. Yeah, me, too.

01:16:56.362 --> 01:16:58.363
Mexico, huh?

01:16:58.447 --> 01:17:00.949
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:17:01.033 --> 01:17:04.786
I see. You're testin' yourselves,
and you don't even know it.

01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:08.581
- Old Mexico - that's a hoot.
- What do you mean?

01:17:08.666 --> 01:17:13.044
They'll cover every possible which way
from Texas to Arizona.

01:17:13.045 --> 01:17:15.630
John Kinney knows everyone
along the border.

01:17:15.715 --> 01:17:18.383
There's a full day's ride
through them thorns,

01:17:18.384 --> 01:17:22.095
which also makes a good hiding place
for scalp hunters and Indians.

01:17:22.096 --> 01:17:25.432
The chances of making Old Mexico?

01:17:25.516 --> 01:17:27.434
Well, hell.

01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:31.271
That's the test of all tests,
if you ask me.

01:17:31.272 --> 01:17:34.024
I'm in.

01:17:38.112 --> 01:17:40.447
I'm really not liking him.

01:17:50.082 --> 01:17:53.251
- Â¡El Chivato!
- Â¡El Chivato!

01:17:53.919 --> 01:17:55.587
Â¡El Chivato!

01:18:04.388 --> 01:18:06.473
"Dear Governor Ax-tell... "

01:18:06.557 --> 01:18:08.975
- Axtell.
- Right.

01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:13.146
"I have heard that you will give... "
What is it?

01:18:13.147 --> 01:18:16.483
- 200.
- "... $200 for my head. "

01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:20.987
"Perhaps we should meet and talk. "

01:18:20.988 --> 01:18:24.491
"I am at the JuÃ¡rez village
at the border. "

01:18:24.575 --> 01:18:26.951
"Send three men

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:29.954
and instruct them not to shoot,

01:18:29.955 --> 01:18:32.791
as I am unarmed. "

01:18:36.128 --> 01:18:38.296
"In short, sir,

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:41.508
I surrender. "

01:18:43.135 --> 01:18:47.764
"Your obedient servant,
William H Bonney. "

01:19:00.111 --> 01:19:03.488
Damn good ridin' with you, Chavez.

01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:09.744
Many nights, my friend...

01:19:11.163 --> 01:19:17.168
many nights, I put a blade to your throat
while you were sleeping.

01:19:17.169 --> 01:19:20.338
I'm glad I never killed you, Steve.

01:19:20.339 --> 01:19:22.215
You're all right.

01:19:50.661 --> 01:19:53.413
"PS,

01:19:53.414 --> 01:19:56.708
I changed my mind. Kiss my ass. "

01:19:59.753 --> 01:20:01.212
Charley's gettin' married!

01:20:40.419 --> 01:20:43.004
Anybody asks you
where you got that hat,

01:20:43.088 --> 01:20:45.757
tell them Billy the Kid gave it to you.

01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:48.176
Now, go on, get out of here.

01:20:51.722 --> 01:20:54.265
- Pat Garrett.
- That's right.

01:20:54.266 --> 01:20:57.936
What are you doing in here?
No one's supposed to come in here.

01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:00.522
Going back to Louisiana
for family business.

01:21:00.606 --> 01:21:03.149
Wanted to see the boy
who's become a sensation.

01:21:03.234 --> 01:21:05.985
- How'd you find me?
- I'm a tracker.

01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:07.987
Gonna be hell as a sheriff.

01:21:08.072 --> 01:21:11.491
- What are you saying, Pat?
- The officials have asked me to run.

01:21:11.575 --> 01:21:14.536
Well, then, I'm asking you to run, too -

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:16.788
that way,

01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:20.041
or I'll take your shittin' scalp
like I did Brady's.

01:21:20.125 --> 01:21:23.336
Billy, I ain't the law yet.

01:21:26.048 --> 01:21:30.051
I've come to tell you some bad news
about a friend we share.

01:21:30.135 --> 01:21:32.595
McSween, Tunstall's lawyer.

01:21:33.013 --> 01:21:36.683
- What about Alex?
- He's going to die tomorrow.

01:21:36.767 --> 01:21:39.143
He and his wife, at his house.

01:21:39.144 --> 01:21:41.563
Murphy knows
he's coming back to Lincoln.

01:21:41.647 --> 01:21:43.815
They're going to pay him a visit.

01:21:43.816 --> 01:21:46.818
- What time do they expect him?
- Suppertime.

01:21:50.781 --> 01:21:54.826
To give the man and his wife
a rightful escort across the border.

01:21:54.827 --> 01:21:57.704
Ain't been to Louisiana for a spell.

01:21:58.163 --> 01:22:00.331
I'll see you, Billy.

01:22:00.416 --> 01:22:02.500
Hey, Garrett.

01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:09.674
Are you my friend?

01:22:13.679 --> 01:22:15.847
Yes, I am, Bill.

01:22:29.528 --> 01:22:31.529
Regulators!

01:22:57.973 --> 01:23:00.642
Hey, Charley.

01:23:00.726 --> 01:23:02.644
Maybe you should stay.

01:23:02.728 --> 01:23:05.563
You can't shoot
worth a piss anyhow.

01:23:06.774 --> 01:23:09.150
Your girl's crying.
Giving me a headache.

01:23:09.234 --> 01:23:11.611
Charley, you got a wife now.

01:23:11.612 --> 01:23:13.780
You should stay.

01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:32.799
Ain't easy havin' pals.

01:23:55.489 --> 01:23:57.490
- Alex?
- Alex?

01:23:58.450 --> 01:24:01.619
What in the name of...?

01:24:01.704 --> 01:24:05.331
Alex, let's go. Word's out -
they're gonna come kill you.

01:24:05.332 --> 01:24:08.668
Dammit, Billy,
I told you not to come here.

01:24:08.752 --> 01:24:12.046
- I'm not leaving my house.
- If you stay, they'll kill you.

01:24:12.131 --> 01:24:15.550
Then I'll have to go around
and kill all the guys who killed you.

01:24:15.634 --> 01:24:18.678
- That's a lot of killing.
- You heard me, Billy.

01:24:18.762 --> 01:24:20.638
You heard me!

01:24:20.723 --> 01:24:24.016
We can't just stay here
and hope that the good Lord saves us...

01:24:24.017 --> 01:24:26.644
Susan, I'm sick.

01:24:26.729 --> 01:24:28.980
I can't go to Old Mexico.

01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:33.985
Out in the middle of the street!
Come on!

01:24:34.945 --> 01:24:38.489
Don't fret, Alex.
The trip's postponed.

01:24:38.490 --> 01:24:41.159
- They're coming around the front.
- Shit.

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:45.496
Bring those wagons up. Quickly!
Keep the house covered.

01:24:45.581 --> 01:24:47.707
It's Peppin.

01:24:50.335 --> 01:24:52.670
Get that wagon over!

01:24:53.714 --> 01:24:54.839
Joe, move it!

01:24:57.885 --> 01:24:59.761
Murphy men.

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:04.932
Charley?

01:25:05.017 --> 01:25:08.561
How's it over by you?
Can we break?

01:25:14.026 --> 01:25:15.526
Uh.

01:25:19.907 --> 01:25:22.241
Hey, Charley! How is it?

01:25:23.285 --> 01:25:25.953
It... it's John Kinney.

01:25:26.455 --> 01:25:31.876
I think the word you got was a trap
to get us all together in the same place.

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:35.713
My God, look at them all.
It's gonna be a massacre.

01:25:35.798 --> 01:25:38.132
Take care of the horses!

01:25:41.345 --> 01:25:46.057
- It... it's John Kinney.
- Well, maybe they just want us.

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:48.392
No.

01:25:48.393 --> 01:25:52.730
They figure they can end the war
right here, in one fell swoop.

01:25:52.815 --> 01:25:56.317
- That's what they're about to do.
- It's John Kinney!

01:25:56.401 --> 01:25:59.612
Thank you very much, Charley!

01:25:59.696 --> 01:26:01.781
Jesus.

01:26:04.743 --> 01:26:06.744
Come on, move it.

01:26:11.250 --> 01:26:13.000
Charley.

01:26:17.297 --> 01:26:19.465
Oh, God.

01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:21.884
Hanging for sure now.

01:26:28.267 --> 01:26:30.601
Hm.

01:26:30.602 --> 01:26:34.272
All right.

01:26:38.151 --> 01:26:40.820
Take a look
at the firepower down here.

01:26:40.821 --> 01:26:44.282
Y'all come on out! Real slow!

01:26:46.952 --> 01:26:49.537
You up there, Bonney?

01:26:52.916 --> 01:26:56.627
Let's have some fun, Doc.
Yeah, I'm here, you bastard!

01:27:51.475 --> 01:27:53.517
What the hell
are we gonna do now?

01:27:53.602 --> 01:27:58.564
We're gonna show these guys
they've finally met their match.

01:27:58.649 --> 01:28:01.776
- Hey, Peppin?
- I'm hearin' you, Bonney!

01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:05.363
I see you got Charley Crawford
down there with you.

01:28:05.364 --> 01:28:08.532
Yeah, we got a whole lot...

01:28:09.076 --> 01:28:11.285
- Oh, my God!
- Damn!

01:28:12.871 --> 01:28:17.625
Hey, Peppin? Charley Crawford
ain't with you any more!

01:28:18.502 --> 01:28:20.962
Bastard! Fire!

01:28:40.023 --> 01:28:42.400
- You all right, Doc?
- Yeah.

01:28:43.735 --> 01:28:46.487
Boy, these boys won't give up!

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:50.950
You OK, ma'am? You OK?

01:28:51.034 --> 01:28:53.494
You OK?

01:28:53.578 --> 01:28:55.413
- Charley?
- Yeah.

01:28:55.414 --> 01:28:57.832
Take two rifles, go on upstairs.

01:28:57.916 --> 01:29:01.335
Doc? You go up with him.
Load heavy!

01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:05.256
Steve? Go on up
and cover the north side.

01:29:05.257 --> 01:29:07.800
Alex?

01:29:07.884 --> 01:29:12.263
This may be your last chance
to handle John's case.

01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:14.932
Active participation in a gun battle

01:29:19.146 --> 01:29:23.482
We know you can shoot, Bonney!
We can, too! Give it up!

01:29:23.567 --> 01:29:25.234
Chavez?

01:30:59.871 --> 01:31:01.872
Chivato.

01:31:30.527 --> 01:31:34.029
They sent in the troops.

01:31:39.161 --> 01:31:42.246
Billy, we're good,
but this is getting ridiculous.

01:31:42.247 --> 01:31:44.248
Dismount!

01:32:00.098 --> 01:32:02.391
I like these odds.

01:32:06.897 --> 01:32:09.273
Mr Murphy. Judge Bristol.

01:32:09.357 --> 01:32:13.694
- We got all the rats in one hole.
- What's been taking so long?

01:32:13.778 --> 01:32:17.781
We didn't want the army here.
We don't need that kind of attention.

01:32:20.827 --> 01:32:24.955
- Son of a bitch.
- Quite a bit of excitement.

01:32:24.956 --> 01:32:26.665
Why are you here, Nathan?

01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:30.294
I was dispatched here
to make sure it doesn't get out of hand.

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:33.839
If you have any hopes
for a political future,

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:36.884
you will respond to our suggestions.

01:32:36.968 --> 01:32:39.678
And what do you suggest, sir?

01:32:39.763 --> 01:32:42.514
Full military attack. Destroy them.

01:32:42.515 --> 01:32:45.059
China! Soldiers, stop her!

01:32:45.143 --> 01:32:46.268
Yen!

01:32:47.437 --> 01:32:50.105
Stop her! China!

01:32:51.358 --> 01:32:53.359
China!

01:32:54.361 --> 01:32:56.612
Yen!

01:32:59.908 --> 01:33:04.286
- The troops're being fired on.
- Cover me.

01:33:04.704 --> 01:33:07.581
But your... the girl!

01:33:07.666 --> 01:33:10.834
- Burn it!
- Excuse me?

01:33:11.253 --> 01:33:13.045
Burn it!

01:33:15.507 --> 01:33:18.008
- Mr Murphy!
- Never mind, Colonel.

01:33:18.093 --> 01:33:23.180
Tell your troops not to mind my men
when they go around back.

01:33:23.181 --> 01:33:26.725
Sergeant,
put your men on the line!

01:33:31.022 --> 01:33:34.149
- Six squads up front.
- Come on, let's go.

01:33:43.702 --> 01:33:46.036
Fire!

01:34:11.896 --> 01:34:14.315
Hold your fire!

01:34:14.399 --> 01:34:16.608
Dammit, cease fire!

01:34:16.693 --> 01:34:18.902
Hey, Billy, please.

01:34:18.903 --> 01:34:21.113
I got to go. I got to go.

01:34:21.197 --> 01:34:26.076
I got a wife. I got a wife.
She's this little Mexican gal. Please!

01:34:26.161 --> 01:34:30.956
Charley, start whipping some ass
or you'll never see her again!

01:34:30.957 --> 01:34:33.083
Now, come on, Charley.

01:34:34.377 --> 01:34:37.046
Go on, now! Come on, giddup!

01:34:38.006 --> 01:34:40.424
That's it. Come on, let's go!

01:34:45.764 --> 01:34:49.224
They lit it, boys!
They lit the house!

01:34:51.603 --> 01:34:54.480
Mr Bonney!
Mr McSween!

01:34:54.564 --> 01:34:57.691
This is Colonel Nathan Dudley!

01:34:57.776 --> 01:35:00.235
Come on out with your hands high!

01:35:02.906 --> 01:35:05.074
"With your hands high. "

01:35:08.119 --> 01:35:10.454
I better reason with him.

01:35:11.289 --> 01:35:15.125
Hey, Colonel Shithead!
You can kiss my ass!

01:35:15.210 --> 01:35:17.169
Goddamn it, Billy!

01:35:17.253 --> 01:35:21.048
You get President Hayes down here,
then we'll come out!

01:35:21.132 --> 01:35:23.842
We'll see how they like that.

01:35:46.324 --> 01:35:48.367
Hey, Kinney, you bastard!

01:35:48.451 --> 01:35:51.036
I'm going to shoot your ass!

01:35:51.037 --> 01:35:54.873
I'll shoot you from here to Patricio
if I have to, you shit dog!

01:35:54.958 --> 01:35:57.292
- Yeah, Charley.
- Maniac!

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:06.176
Get 'em!

01:36:08.263 --> 01:36:10.264
Maniac!

01:36:14.436 --> 01:36:16.270
Yeah, Charley!

01:36:16.354 --> 01:36:18.188
Yeah!

01:36:18.273 --> 01:36:21.066
- Yeah, Charley!
- Yeah! Yeah!

01:36:21.151 --> 01:36:25.571
Yeah, Charley!

01:36:40.211 --> 01:36:42.171
Yeah, Charley.

01:36:44.716 --> 01:36:47.384
Alex! Get Susan out of here!

01:36:47.469 --> 01:36:49.803
- Come on, get out.
- Stop.

01:36:51.389 --> 01:36:56.101
- No, I want my things.
- Susan, come on, get out!

01:37:00.982 --> 01:37:04.234
There's a woman coming out!
Let my wife come out!

01:37:04.319 --> 01:37:08.071
Hold it. There's a lady coming out.
Hold your fire!

01:37:14.621 --> 01:37:16.788
Yen, go home.

01:37:21.169 --> 01:37:23.253
- Go!
- I stay with you.

01:37:23.254 --> 01:37:25.506
Necessary.

01:37:27.592 --> 01:37:29.426
Colonel.

01:37:29.427 --> 01:37:34.681
Colonel, can I do anything for you, sir?
Back in the tent, perhaps?

01:37:34.766 --> 01:37:38.101
I have no time for complaints.
Go to the other side of the street

01:37:38.186 --> 01:37:40.479
so I can do my j...

01:37:40.563 --> 01:37:44.149
- You animal.
- Get her out of here! Take her away!

01:37:44.150 --> 01:37:46.318
Leave me alone!

01:37:48.947 --> 01:37:52.699
Alex!

01:37:55.954 --> 01:37:59.164
Where's Chavez?
Where the hell's Chavez?

01:37:59.165 --> 01:38:00.832
- I don't know!
- What?

01:38:00.917 --> 01:38:02.834
He's gone.
He must have skinned out!

01:38:02.919 --> 01:38:06.213
I knew it! That dirty Mexican dog!

01:38:06.297 --> 01:38:08.173
I... I...

01:38:08.174 --> 01:38:11.343
I knew we shouldn't have trusted him!
I knew it!

01:38:11.427 --> 01:38:15.472
We're gonna die in here and he's
out there doin' it with his horse!

01:38:15.557 --> 01:38:19.184
I knew it! I just knew it!

01:38:36.119 --> 01:38:38.287
Yeah!

01:39:16.075 --> 01:39:18.035
Run!

01:39:29.964 --> 01:39:32.299
Chavez!

01:39:33.968 --> 01:39:35.552
Yeah!

01:39:35.553 --> 01:39:37.721
Regulators!

01:39:41.851 --> 01:39:43.060
Billy!

01:39:50.318 --> 01:39:53.779
Hey, Kinney, you bastard,
it's you and I!

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.125
Doc!

01:40:37.949 --> 01:40:39.616
Go, go, go!

01:40:59.470 --> 01:41:03.306
He's getting away!
Dudley! Get that son of a bitch!

01:41:03.391 --> 01:41:06.476
- Ride, boys!
- Dudley!

01:41:06.561 --> 01:41:09.771
- Get that son of a bitch!
- Ride!

01:41:27.290 --> 01:41:29.791
Those bastards...

01:41:34.255 --> 01:41:37.340
Reap it, Murphy,
you son of a bitch.

01:41:50.354 --> 01:41:52.230
Now it's over.

01:41:54.192 --> 01:41:58.945
Advices from Lincoln report Jose
Chavez Y Chavez moved to California

01:41:59.030 --> 01:42:03.200
where he changed his name
and took work on a fruit ranch.

01:42:03.284 --> 01:42:07.412
Josiah "Doc" Scurlock was reported
to have left the West for the East,

01:42:07.497 --> 01:42:12.250
taking with him a Celestial bride, her
mother, and 14 brothers and sisters.

01:42:12.335 --> 01:42:16.880
Susan McSween saw her husband's
and John Tunstall's dreams to fruition

01:42:16.964 --> 01:42:21.468
by becoming one of the most
prominent cattle women of all time.

01:42:21.552 --> 01:42:25.305
Governor Axtell was forced to resign
by president Rutherford B Hayes

01:42:25.389 --> 01:42:31.436
and both the Murphy-Dolan faction
and the Santa Fe ring collapsed.

01:42:31.437 --> 01:42:35.106
William H Bonney -
also known as Billy the Kid -

01:42:35.191 --> 01:42:38.068
continued to ride,
never leaving New Mexico.

01:42:38.069 --> 01:42:42.280
He was caught in Fort Sumner
by the sheriff Pat Garrett and killed.

01:42:42.365 --> 01:42:46.618
Sources report that he was unarmed
and shot in the dark.

01:42:46.619 --> 01:42:50.831
He was buried with Charley Bowdre
in Old Fort Sumner.

01:42:50.915 --> 01:42:55.794
Advices report that an unidentified
person snuck into the graveyard

01:42:58.339 --> 01:43:01.424
The epitaph read only one word:

01:43:01.509 --> 01:43:03.426
"Pals. "
