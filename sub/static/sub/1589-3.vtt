00:01.130 --> 00:03.269
NARRATOR: Previously on
Pretty Little Liars...

00:03.300 --> 00:05.461
You need to walk in there
and tell them everything,

00:05.500 --> 00:07.593
about Mona being 'A',
Shana taking over

00:07.640 --> 00:08.698
where Mona left off,
all of it.

00:08.740 --> 00:09.764
Are we in agreement?

00:09.810 --> 00:12.301
We can begin with the night
that you disappeared.

00:12.340 --> 00:13.307
I didn't disappear.

00:13.340 --> 00:16.104
I was kidnapped
and held hostage for 2 years.

00:16.150 --> 00:18.300
Ali goes rogue
and we're just expected

00:18.350 --> 00:19.544
to back up her story?

00:19.580 --> 00:20.774
I killed her, Emily,
and I don't know

00:20.820 --> 00:21.946
how I'm gonna be
able to live with that.

00:21.980 --> 00:24.710
Shana had been using us
as target practice for months.

00:24.750 --> 00:26.081
I sent that text.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.781
And you're gonna
wish you stayed dead.

00:27.820 --> 00:30.323
Your mother can never
know what you told me.

00:30.360 --> 00:31.554
Mrs. D wrote
that email the night

00:31.590 --> 00:33.399
that she skipped town,
but she never sent it.

00:33.430 --> 00:35.091
Jason, why were
you in New York?

00:35.130 --> 00:36.666
You think I'm the one
who kidnapped her?

00:36.700 --> 00:38.395
Aaaah! Oh!

00:38.430 --> 00:40.398
Don't! No, Jason!

00:47.310 --> 00:49.175
ARIA: Are you okay?

00:49.210 --> 00:50.302
HANNA: _
Can we get you something?

00:52.150 --> 00:53.412
SPENCER:
Something to eat?

00:53.450 --> 00:54.644
Some water?

01:13.870 --> 01:14.859
JASON:
Just leave her alone.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.834
_ KENNETH:
I thInk you girls should go.

01:16.870 --> 01:18.565
ARIA:
But, Mr. DiLaurentis...

01:18.610 --> 01:20.100
KENNETH:
She's been through a lot.

01:20.140 --> 01:21.676
SPENCER: But...
JASON: He's right.

01:21.710 --> 01:23.143
We should
all get out of here.

01:35.690 --> 01:37.180
Do you want me
to help you get dressed?

01:38.890 --> 01:40.096
No.

01:41.800 --> 01:44.598
Do you think there are gonna be
a lot of people at the funeral?

01:44.630 --> 01:46.393
I don't know.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.607
You can go downstairs.

01:50.640 --> 01:52.904
I'll be there in a minute.

01:52.940 --> 01:54.430
Okay.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.457
KENNETH: I don't want to see
any police--

02:07.490 --> 02:10.357
not at the funeral,
not at the cemetery.

02:10.390 --> 02:11.857
No police, no press.

02:11.890 --> 02:13.357
I took care of it.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.492
Did you?

02:14.530 --> 02:16.361
Yes, I did.

02:19.470 --> 02:20.630
Hey, how is she?

02:20.670 --> 02:22.228
She's getting dressed.

02:22.270 --> 02:23.931
Yeah, but how is she?

02:23.970 --> 02:25.665
She's going
to her mom's funeral.

02:25.710 --> 02:26.802
How do you think she is?

02:26.840 --> 02:29.638
She's going to bury the woman
who tried to bury her.

02:29.680 --> 02:34.379
Question is, who buried
Ali's mom in Spencer's baclqard?

02:34.420 --> 02:35.773
It wasn't Jason.

02:35.820 --> 02:37.378
What makes you so sure?

02:37.420 --> 02:40.958
Because I saw his face
when...the dog found the body.

02:40.990 --> 02:42.958
A dog who knows
where the body was buried?

02:42.990 --> 02:44.480
That sounds
exactly like 'A.'

02:44.530 --> 02:46.725
Dogs dig. Okay?
That's just what they do.

02:46.760 --> 02:48.523
They smell something
and they dig.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.323
You didn't have
to mention the smelly part.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.668
Aria, 'A' is gone.

02:52.700 --> 02:54.258
You know that.

02:54.300 --> 02:55.392
Yeah, 'A' might be gone,

02:55.440 --> 02:56.930
but we still have
to deal with Mona.

02:56.970 --> 02:58.631
She knows that All
wasn't kidnapped.

02:58.670 --> 03:00.979
Got in Ali's face
about it.

03:01.010 --> 03:03.774
She's not the only one
we have to worry about.

03:06.980 --> 03:07.969
NoelKahn?

03:08.020 --> 03:10.488
He's going to do whatever
is best for Noel Kahn.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.317
That's not
who I was thinking of.

03:17.590 --> 03:19.421
HANNA: That's not the dress
we picked out.

03:19.460 --> 03:22.623
That's not hers,
but I've seen it somewhere.

03:29.370 --> 03:31.338
Why are you wearing
that dress?

03:33.610 --> 03:37.398
I wanted to wear something
of Mom's to feel close to her.

03:37.450 --> 03:38.849
I got it
out of her closet.

03:38.880 --> 03:39.812
Changeit
Dad.

03:39.850 --> 03:42.341
Why?
Go upstairs
and put on something else.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.210
We're late now.

04:01.300 --> 04:03.268
I just wanted to wear
something of hers.

04:03.310 --> 04:05.335
Why is he so angry?

04:05.370 --> 04:07.679
Ali, your mother
wore that dress.

04:07.710 --> 04:09.575
I know.

04:09.610 --> 04:12.545
She wore it
to your funeral.

04:16.590 --> 04:17.841
We should go.

04:17.890 --> 04:19.312
Come on.

04:23.090 --> 04:24.751
Coincidences happen.

04:24.790 --> 04:26.291
Yeah, all the time.

04:26.330 --> 04:27.854
They grow on trees,
like coconuts.

04:27.900 --> 04:30.425
Just waiting for you
to walk under them.

04:33.640 --> 04:34.993
* Got a secret

04:35.040 --> 04:36.439
* Can you keep it?

04:36.470 --> 04:38.836
* Swear this
one you'll save *

04:38.870 --> 04:41.430
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

04:41.480 --> 04:43.869
* Taking this one
to the grave *

04:43.910 --> 04:45.946
* If I show you
then I know *

04:45.980 --> 04:48.869
* You won't tell
what I saId *

04:48.920 --> 04:51.480
* 'Cause two can
keep a secret *

04:51.520 --> 04:53.784
* If one of them is dead

04:58.430 --> 05:01.092
The four of you have had
a very stressful week.

05:01.130 --> 05:03.064
I want you to know
how legitimately relieved

05:03.100 --> 05:04.988
we all are
that you're safe

05:05.030 --> 05:06.395
and what it means
to have you back

05:06.440 --> 05:08.795
in the halls of
Rosewood High School.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.637
We're happy to be back.

05:10.670 --> 05:12.672
But I would be
disingenuous

05:12.710 --> 05:14.928
to say that things will be
as they were before,

05:14.980 --> 05:17.005
at least
in the short term.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.041
I think
we understand that.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.012
As I told your parents,

05:20.050 --> 05:21.540
the school will protect you

05:21.580 --> 05:25.539
from the press
and the curious.

05:25.590 --> 05:27.808
We appreciate that,
Mr. Hackett.

05:27.860 --> 05:30.420
But there are limits
to what we can do

05:30.460 --> 05:32.325
under these
unusual Circumstances.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.569
I need to know
that you Will do your part

05:37.600 --> 05:40.398
to keep the disruptions
to a minimum.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.536
You won't even know
that we're here.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.148
God, Hackett wishes
we transferred

05:50.180 --> 05:51.841
to a high school
in Borneo.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.973
Maybe coming back
wasn't such a good idea.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.887
We have to at least
act like things are normal.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.683
This is
your idea of normal?

05:58.720 --> 06:00.984
When we were in New York,
Ali's mom was killed

06:01.020 --> 06:03.454
and_ now we're_ in
one of Ali's biggest lies ever.

06:03.490 --> 06:05.128
We can't pretend forever.

06:05.160 --> 06:07.390
Somebody's gonna connect
all this to Shana.

06:07.430 --> 06:08.795
Yeah, probably Jenna.

06:08.830 --> 06:10.491
I'm more worried about
the people who already know

06:10.530 --> 06:11.963
that All was lying
about New York.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.137
Noel and Mona?

06:13.170 --> 06:14.899
And Ezra.

06:17.870 --> 06:19.599
You know,
somebody has to go talk to him

06:19.640 --> 06:20.800
and make sure
he's gonna keep quiet

06:20.840 --> 06:22.000
about what
really happened.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.177
Not _me.
Aria.

06:23.210 --> 06:25.405
He's alive, he's safe,
but we are over.

06:25.450 --> 06:26.747
You guys can ask me
to do anything else,

06:26.780 --> 06:28.577
but you can't ask me
to do that.

06:31.120 --> 06:33.486
Mr. DiLaurentis
kept the cops away

06:33.520 --> 06:35.158
before the funeral,
but that's over.

06:35.190 --> 06:36.726
I mean, it's not
gonna take them long

06:36.760 --> 06:38.751
before they start punching holes
in Ali's kidnap story.

06:38.790 --> 06:39.552
And when that happens,

06:39.600 --> 06:40.828
I mean, we have
to have something

06:40.860 --> 06:41.929
real to give to the police

06:41.960 --> 06:44.667
to explain why Alison lied
and why we backed her up.

06:44.700 --> 06:45.928
Real such as?

06:45.970 --> 06:47.835
Real as in who hit
Alison that night

06:47.870 --> 06:49.701
and who killed Mrs. D.

06:49.740 --> 06:51.708
We're all thinking
the same person.

06:51.740 --> 06:53.537
Really,
did you start reading minds?

06:53.580 --> 06:54.877
Spencer,
it has to be Jason.

06:54.910 --> 06:57.640
I told you, guys,
I saw his face.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.477
Hanna found the email
where Mrs. DiLaurentis

06:59.520 --> 07:01.112
was telling him she couldn't
protect him anymore.

07:01.150 --> 07:02.447
Protect him from what?

07:02.490 --> 07:04.048
He was the one
who hit Alison that night.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.512
We don't know that.

07:05.550 --> 07:06.687
It makes sense.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.517
Mrs. D saw who hit Alison.

07:08.560 --> 07:10.448
And what did she do?
She covered up the crime.

07:10.490 --> 07:12.026
Who else would you
have done that for?

07:12.060 --> 07:13.596
( bell ringing )

07:13.630 --> 07:15.257
We should
probably go inside.

07:19.130 --> 07:21.234
She doesn't think
that Jason would do this.

07:21.270 --> 07:23.534
Jason's her half-brother.

07:23.570 --> 07:25.709
She's going to take
some more convincing.

07:25.740 --> 07:28.106
Do you want to do a trip
to Philadelphia tonight?

07:28.140 --> 07:29.801
What's in Philadelphia?

07:29.850 --> 07:31.943
I want to know what's
in that house Jason went to.

07:31.980 --> 07:33.618
I can't tonight.

07:33.650 --> 07:35.618
Why? Are you hanging out
with Travis?

07:35.650 --> 07:36.947
No.
I have to be with Ali.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.048
I have to take
her somewhere.

07:38.090 --> 07:39.557
Where?

07:39.590 --> 07:40.784
The funeral home.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.967
Welcome back
to these hallowed halls.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.194
Thanks.

07:51.230 --> 07:52.561
Oh, I wanted
to make sure I found you

07:52.600 --> 07:54.830
before all the good spaces
were taken.

07:54.870 --> 07:56.633
Mr. Fitz's get-well card.

07:56.670 --> 07:57.967
You know what happened
to him in New York.

07:58.010 --> 07:59.102
Yeah, he was mugged.

07:59.140 --> 08:01.938
He was shot,
but he's back now.

08:01.980 --> 08:03.641
So...

08:03.680 --> 08:06.171
Wait a second. What do you
mean that he's back?

08:06.210 --> 08:10.283
Not here, not in school.
In Rosewood.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.185
Recuperating.

08:12.220 --> 08:14.950
You didn't know that part?

08:14.990 --> 08:16.651
No.

08:16.690 --> 08:17.759
Don't you want
to sign the card?

08:17.790 --> 08:21.624
I think that you should,
for the sake of appearances.

08:21.660 --> 08:25.221
We all have to be careful
how others see us.

08:25.270 --> 08:27.238
I heard you were floating
around with this.

08:27.270 --> 08:28.669
Are you going
to give it to him?

08:28.700 --> 08:30.736
Maybe with candy?

08:30.770 --> 08:32.306
Well, they said that
he was shot in the stomach,

08:32.340 --> 08:35.002
so I thought flowers.

08:35.040 --> 08:36.598
Ah, good choice.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.277
Sign.

08:38.310 --> 08:39.914
What's it going to be like

08:39.950 --> 08:42.885
when Ali comes back
to Rosewood High?

08:42.920 --> 08:44.148
Oh, come on.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.249
If she's still Ali,
she wants to come back,

08:46.290 --> 08:47.655
pick up
where she left off.

08:47.690 --> 08:49.885
And look at that story
she's got to tell.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.922
All that drama
and danger and suspense.

08:52.960 --> 08:55.520
Couldn't be more exciting
if she made up the whole thing.

08:57.800 --> 09:01.167
Hey, Mona,
have you seen Noel Kahn?

09:01.200 --> 09:04.203
Oh, I'm sure he's around
somewhere getting into mischief.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.671
She said
that Ezra's back in Rosewood.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.142
Sorry.

09:19.220 --> 09:22.018
I wasn't following you.
I just saw you dropped that.

09:22.060 --> 09:23.880
Thank you.

09:23.930 --> 09:26.899
I'm really sorry about
what happened to Alison.

09:26.930 --> 09:29.228
Are you sorry
about anything else?

09:36.840 --> 09:39.604
I've had
all the being-stared-at
I can handle for one day.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.946
I'll take care of it.

09:43.980 --> 09:46.346
I know her. She's on the team,
she just transferred in.

09:46.380 --> 09:48.712
It's not important.
Forget it.

09:54.990 --> 09:56.787
Nice having
Emily back, isn't it?

09:58.830 --> 10:01.128
You haven't signed
the card for Mr. Fitz.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.279
Can I help you
with something?

10:19.720 --> 10:20.778
Sorry?

10:20.820 --> 10:23.380
People have been staring at me
and my friends all day.

10:23.420 --> 10:24.978
So why don't you take
a really good look,

10:25.020 --> 10:26.851
and_ we can_ all move on
With our lives, okay?

10:26.890 --> 10:28.949
And, yes, I know the dead girl
who isn't dead anymore.

10:28.990 --> 10:30.082
Okay?

10:30.130 --> 10:31.927
I was just looking
at your trophies.

10:31.960 --> 10:32.995
My what?

10:33.030 --> 10:34.657
The trophies in the case.

10:34.700 --> 10:35.849
You're Emily Fields,

10:35.900 --> 10:38.061
your name is
on all the trophies.

10:38.100 --> 10:40.330
I figured out who you were
when I saw you talking to Paige.

10:40.370 --> 10:41.769
I'm on the team with her.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.404
I'm Sydney Driscoll.

10:43.440 --> 10:45.635
Sorry for shouting.

10:48.910 --> 10:51.105
I thought you'd be taller.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.777
What?

10:52.820 --> 10:54.913
I mean, you're tall,
but I thought you'd be taller.

10:54.950 --> 10:55.939
All the trophies.

10:55.980 --> 10:57.686
I figured
you had an advantage.

10:57.720 --> 10:59.017
Being tall helps,

10:59.050 --> 11:01.757
but not as much as
everybody thinks.

11:01.790 --> 11:03.018
They said you hurt
your shoulder.

11:03.060 --> 11:05.984
That's why you're not
on the team anymore.

11:06.030 --> 11:08.294
You must miss it.

11:08.330 --> 11:09.820
I do.

11:11.300 --> 11:12.289
Listen,
I transferred 3 weeks ago,

11:12.330 --> 11:13.433
I'm bottom of the roster

11:13.470 --> 11:15.028
and I can use
all the help I can get.

11:15.070 --> 11:16.435
What does
that have to do with me?

11:16.470 --> 11:18.438
Watch me in the pool.

11:18.470 --> 11:20.233
Fifteen minutes,
and then tell me what you think.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.942
Please?

11:22.980 --> 11:24.948
( bell ringing )

11:40.360 --> 11:42.920
Don't let them
catch you looking.

11:42.970 --> 11:45.495
What do you think?
Somebody's gonna throw a rock?

11:45.530 --> 11:47.293
It's a possibility.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.296
They hate us enough.

11:49.340 --> 11:51.729
We're not exactly
the Hatfields and the McCoys.

11:51.770 --> 11:54.898
Nothing so rustic.

11:54.940 --> 11:57.101
More like the Borgias
and the Medicis.

11:58.850 --> 12:01.512
That ended pretty nasty
as well, too.

12:01.550 --> 12:03.245
A lot of matricide.

12:06.520 --> 12:08.351
You think that
Jason killed his mother.

12:08.390 --> 12:10.950
People are capable
of all sorts of things

12:10.990 --> 12:13.129
under the right pressures.

12:13.160 --> 12:16.197
Well, there's plenty of pressure
right here in this house.

12:20.570 --> 12:22.538
Why did you send
Toby after me?

12:22.570 --> 12:24.231
I didn't.

12:24.270 --> 12:26.261
He went on his own.

12:26.310 --> 12:29.131
Why did you lie about seeing
him in London when you hadn't?

12:29.180 --> 12:31.546
On a practical level, there's
no difference between me

12:31.580 --> 12:33.844
seeing him
and knowing he was there.

12:33.880 --> 12:36.440
Then on a practical level,
why lie about it?

12:36.480 --> 12:39.142
I was trying to keep
Wren out of it.

12:39.190 --> 12:40.487
Mom and Dad are worried
enough Without me

12:40.520 --> 12:43.387
dragging him
back into things.

12:43.430 --> 12:47.389
And Who do you think they're
more worried about, me or you?

12:49.130 --> 12:52.395
Worry less about me, Spencer,
and more about yourself.

12:52.430 --> 12:55.331
You brought Alison back home,
safe and sound.

12:55.370 --> 12:57.167
Good for you.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.336
Frankly, I wish you
would have left her

12:58.370 --> 13:00.509
where you found her,
but you didn't.

13:00.540 --> 13:03.304
She's back in the bosom of
what's left of her family.

13:03.350 --> 13:06.547
Now stay away from her
and the rest of them.

13:06.580 --> 13:08.878
I'm related
to parts of that family.

13:08.920 --> 13:10.239
And so are you.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.814
And blood
is thicker than water?

13:11.850 --> 13:12.885
That's what they say.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.787
It can also be
very slippery.

13:24.530 --> 13:28.432
He could have just dropped
the damn visitation book
at my house.

13:28.470 --> 13:29.937
He said
he wanted to meet you.

13:29.970 --> 13:32.268
Everybody wants
to meet me.

13:32.310 --> 13:34.574
God, I hate these places.

13:34.610 --> 13:36.032
Nobody likes them.

13:36.080 --> 13:38.105
Well, I hate them.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.469
My mom always wanted me

13:39.510 --> 13:41.273
to understand
the fragile nature of life

13:41.320 --> 13:43.345
so she dragged me
to all of my relatives' funerals

13:43.390 --> 13:45.039
starting from the time
I was seven.

13:45.090 --> 13:48.116
All these people I didn't know
standing around crying,

13:48.160 --> 13:50.128
me choking
on the smell of flowers.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.388
God.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.559
I'll be right back.

14:04.610 --> 14:06.100
Do you want me
to come with you?

14:13.520 --> 14:15.010
I'm sorry you had to wait.

14:15.050 --> 14:18.349
Oh, it's fine.
It was only a minute.

14:18.390 --> 14:20.085
Thank you.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.452
I only got back
to town yesterday.

14:22.490 --> 14:24.355
I spoke with your father
on the phone.

14:24.390 --> 14:25.357
You did?

14:25.390 --> 14:28.052
I like to meet as many
family members as I can.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.068
That's why I wanted
to give you that in person.

14:30.100 --> 14:33.228
IfI could have returned
for your mother's serwces,

14:33.270 --> 14:35.534
I would have.

14:35.570 --> 14:36.594
My mother? I--

14:38.270 --> 14:41.330
I'm sorry,
that's Alison DiLaurentis.

14:45.580 --> 14:46.911
Are you Mr. Donahue?

14:46.950 --> 14:48.144
Yes.

14:48.180 --> 14:49.989
I apologize.

14:50.020 --> 14:52.909
Mr. Thorpe told me
that Alison DiLaurentis was here

14:52.960 --> 14:56.555
and from the description
I had I just assumed that...

14:56.590 --> 14:59.923
Oh, um,
this is my friend Hanna.

14:59.960 --> 15:03.123
It used to be a little easier
to tell us apart, wasn't it?

15:14.310 --> 15:16.175
MONA: Sad, sad, sad.

15:20.580 --> 15:22.116
How are you, Hanna?

15:24.520 --> 15:25.919
I'm okay.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.497
Two months.

15:38.530 --> 15:40.236
That's not good.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.431
They say the longer
someone's missing the less

15:43.470 --> 15:45.165
likely they'll
ever come back.

15:47.610 --> 15:50.101
Where are your glasses?

15:50.150 --> 15:52.106
I don't wear them anymore.

15:52.150 --> 15:53.708
You look different.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.415
Look how pretty she is.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.084
Ever wonder What
you'd look like

16:01.120 --> 16:03.486
on one of those flyers?

16:03.530 --> 16:06.488
Probably just put a blank space
instead of a picture.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.656
If Alison's really gone,

16:11.470 --> 16:14.337
What do you mean,
"If she's really gone"?

16:14.370 --> 16:15.997
Do you want
to know the secret?

16:16.040 --> 16:17.439
What secret?

16:17.470 --> 16:20.507
The secret
to becoming unforgettable.

16:29.650 --> 16:31.140
Hanna?

16:33.620 --> 16:35.019
Let's go.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.628
How long are they going
to keep us out of the baclqard?

16:44.670 --> 16:47.764
The police still consider it
an active crime scene.

16:49.740 --> 16:52.766
What's gonna happen
when the tape comes down?

16:52.810 --> 16:54.675
How would you feel about
selling the house?

16:57.180 --> 16:58.272
I don't know.

16:58.310 --> 17:01.143
Think about it.

17:01.180 --> 17:02.374
You know,
when you sell a house,

17:02.420 --> 17:04.513
don't you have to inform
the buyer of things like

17:04.550 --> 17:07.781
mold and termites
and dead bodies?

17:07.820 --> 17:08.616
Well,
we might have to knock

17:08.660 --> 17:11.185
a few thousand off
the asking price.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.021
Yeah. Life is full
of sacrifices.

17:17.570 --> 17:20.494
Stay or go,
we're finished with that family.

17:25.170 --> 17:27.229
You know, Dad,
we can sell the house,

17:27.280 --> 17:28.269
we can move away,

17:28.310 --> 17:30.778
but we will always be
connected to that family.

17:30.810 --> 17:32.072
And you know Why.

17:32.110 --> 17:36.718
Sometimes complicated problems
have simple solutions, Spencer.

17:36.750 --> 17:39.617
Melissa thinks that
Jason killed his mother.

17:39.650 --> 17:41.288
That's for the police
to determine.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.254
Well, it's not her job
to point them in his direction.

17:43.290 --> 17:44.621
What do you want me to do?
Stop her.

17:44.660 --> 17:46.287
Spencer,
anything that gets the police

17:46.330 --> 17:49.629
to look anywhere other than
this house is a good thing.

17:49.660 --> 17:51.059
For all of us.

17:53.370 --> 17:55.235
You know, Dad,
forget about selling the house.

17:55.270 --> 17:57.409
We can just
put a koi pond out back.

17:57.440 --> 17:59.305
Somebody
already dug a hole.

18:31.640 --> 18:35.201
So I have my own
healthcare professional,

18:35.240 --> 18:38.277
Mrs. Esther Walling.

18:38.310 --> 18:39.675
She comes over every day.

18:39.710 --> 18:40.916
It's very nice.

18:40.950 --> 18:43.783
She says that I'm her
favorite gunshot victim.

18:52.330 --> 18:54.753
Look, I know I promised

18:54.800 --> 18:56.256
that I wouldn't
come back here.

18:56.300 --> 18:59.360
But I don't really have
anywhere else to go.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.265
How do you feel?

19:01.300 --> 19:02.631
How do I feel?

19:02.670 --> 19:06.902
I feel like a turkey
that's been carved up

19:06.940 --> 19:09.500
and then sewn
back together.

19:09.540 --> 19:11.849
Nothing really feels like
it's in the right place.

19:11.880 --> 19:13.916
My counselor says that's...

19:13.950 --> 19:17.784
post-surgical
mind-body dysphoria.

19:17.820 --> 19:19.310
It's supposed
to go away, though.

19:22.290 --> 19:25.657
Do you know everything
that's happened with Alison?

19:25.690 --> 19:27.521
Only What
I've seen on the TV.

19:27.560 --> 19:29.448
She told the police
that she was kidnapped

19:29.500 --> 19:31.695
and that you found her
in Philadelphia.

19:31.730 --> 19:33.595
Is that the story
you all agreed upon?

19:35.240 --> 19:37.868
Well, it's the story
that she told, so...

19:37.910 --> 19:40.538
And we have
to live with it?

19:40.580 --> 19:41.877
That's the deal?

19:41.910 --> 19:44.549
Yeah. At least for now.

19:48.850 --> 19:51.944
Do you know about
Mrs. DiLaurentis?

19:51.990 --> 19:54.550
I know she was murdered.

19:54.590 --> 19:55.852
And I thought
Shana did it,

19:55.890 --> 19:59.485
but the timing
doesn't really work out.

19:59.530 --> 20:01.418
I had everything
backwards.

20:01.460 --> 20:03.826
But once I knew
that Shana was following you

20:03.870 --> 20:05.667
and then I saw her
in New York

20:05.700 --> 20:09.693
dressed like that, well,
I knew she was 'A' then.

20:11.340 --> 20:14.571
Have you heard from her
at all since you've been back?

20:14.610 --> 20:16.669
No.

20:16.710 --> 20:18.678
You have to be
careful then,

20:18.710 --> 20:20.678
because she's clearly
still out there.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.517
Yeah, well,
there's cops at Rosewood High

20:22.550 --> 20:24.745
and all over town,

20:24.790 --> 20:27.452
in case Ali's kidnapper
comes back.

20:27.490 --> 20:28.855
You need to be careful.

20:28.890 --> 20:30.426
All of you.

20:32.730 --> 20:33.992
I better go.

20:38.700 --> 20:40.019
Oh, that's a new lock.

20:40.070 --> 20:41.867
Let me get that for you.

20:52.910 --> 20:54.912
Um...

20:54.950 --> 20:57.680
thanks for coming
and for letting me see you.

20:59.050 --> 21:00.586
Yeah, I wanted to see you.

21:17.100 --> 21:18.704
I watched your videos.

21:18.740 --> 21:20.776
I'm trying to match
your stroke rate.

21:20.810 --> 21:22.368
My stroke rate
won't work for you.

21:22.410 --> 21:23.775
Because you're
taller than me?

21:23.810 --> 21:26.040
No, it's not the height,
it's your ratio.

21:26.080 --> 21:27.775
Of What to what?

21:27.820 --> 21:29.071
Well,
what's your Ape Index?

21:29.120 --> 21:31.543
My what?

21:31.590 --> 21:32.887
Stand up
against the locker,

21:32.920 --> 21:35.650
touch the floor
with your middle finger.

21:35.690 --> 21:36.884
Okay, now reach up
with your other hand

21:36.920 --> 21:38.581
and stretch out
as far as you can.

21:41.560 --> 21:43.790
Now stand up with
your back against the locker.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.400
It's about 3 inches.

21:50.440 --> 21:53.477
Your Ape Index
is negative three.

21:53.510 --> 21:55.876
Should I be taking
something for that?

21:55.910 --> 21:57.639
No, no, it just means
that your reach

21:57.680 --> 21:59.739
is 3 inches less than
your height.

21:59.780 --> 22:00.747
So?

22:00.780 --> 22:02.077
So if you don't
have long arms,

22:02.120 --> 22:03.542
don't copy
swimmers who do.

22:03.590 --> 22:05.410
Emily has great arms.

22:05.450 --> 22:07.008
For swimming.

22:07.050 --> 22:09.655
Just adjust
your stroke rate.

22:10.990 --> 22:13.083
Did you two spend
a lot of time together?

22:13.130 --> 22:14.552
Training?

22:14.600 --> 22:15.953
Not really.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.558
Not one-on-one.

22:17.600 --> 22:18.828
But we were together.

22:18.870 --> 22:19.859
In the pool.

22:19.900 --> 22:21.037
And out.

22:21.070 --> 22:22.560
In and out.

22:22.600 --> 22:23.908
Of the pool.

22:23.940 --> 22:27.068
Right.

22:27.110 --> 22:28.839
Well, I'm gonna
change now.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.745
Okay.

22:55.740 --> 22:57.901
Abracadabra.

23:00.740 --> 23:04.403
Now we have to do
something about this,

23:04.450 --> 23:06.441
because you need
a new wardrobe to go

23:06.480 --> 23:07.947
with your new silhouette.

23:12.790 --> 23:14.678
Hanna?

23:14.720 --> 23:15.982
That was Ali's.

23:16.020 --> 23:18.159
She left it here
after a sleepover one night.

23:20.090 --> 23:21.159
Try it on.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.054
It's not gonna fit.

23:23.100 --> 23:24.658
Try it.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.549
It fits.

23:42.580 --> 23:45.947
Like it was made for you.

23:47.690 --> 23:51.080
See? Everything's
better with a friend.

23:57.130 --> 23:58.927
So What did he say?

23:58.970 --> 24:01.768
He heard about the story
of you being kidnapped.

24:01.800 --> 24:03.700
And?

24:03.740 --> 24:05.833
And he said he's not gonna
say anything different

24:05.870 --> 24:07.167
if anyone asks.

24:07.210 --> 24:09.531
Good.
That's one less problem.

24:09.580 --> 24:13.539
Does he know...about Shana?

24:13.580 --> 24:15.810
No.

24:15.850 --> 24:17.511
It's better
that he doesn't.

24:20.150 --> 24:21.617
Look, Mona thinks
that you're coming back

24:21.660 --> 24:22.786
to Rosewood High.

24:22.820 --> 24:24.651
Does she?

24:24.690 --> 24:25.679
Yeah.

24:25.730 --> 24:29.052
She could really create
some trouble if you did.

24:29.100 --> 24:31.125
Mona and Ez_ra know _
that you weren't kidnapped, Ali.

24:31.170 --> 24:33.695
But Ezra doesn't look
at the world the way Mona does.

24:33.740 --> 24:36.129
Ezra's not a bad guy, Aria.

24:36.170 --> 24:38.707
He's just too romantic
for his own good.

24:38.740 --> 24:40.139
That's probably
why you fell for him.

24:40.170 --> 24:42.229
Okay, I really don't
need you analyzing

24:42.280 --> 24:44.100
my personality right now.

24:48.150 --> 24:49.242
Here.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.838
This is what
you asked for.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.711
Keep it. Burn it.
I don't care.

24:53.760 --> 24:56.718
Do you need anything else?

24:56.760 --> 24:58.682
Shana tried to kill Ezra,

24:58.730 --> 24:59.924
and she would have
killed all of us

24:59.960 --> 25:01.791
if you didn't stop her.

25:03.770 --> 25:05.192
Do you need anything else?

25:08.170 --> 25:09.797
No.

25:33.090 --> 25:38.767
Hey, you girls looking
for a sub-let still?

25:38.800 --> 25:41.098
We weren't really honest
with you the last time

25:41.140 --> 25:43.028
we were here.

25:43.070 --> 25:44.662
No kidding.

25:46.070 --> 25:47.799
You make
a good watchdog, Arnie.

25:49.940 --> 25:51.043
I was talking
to your friend

25:51.080 --> 25:53.071
who owns the pizza
shop down the street.

25:53.110 --> 25:56.273
He says that you're a regular
customer and a good tipper.

25:56.320 --> 25:59.084
Three pies,
two, three times a week.

25:59.120 --> 26:01.088
You feeding
an army in there?

26:01.120 --> 26:03.088
What kind of army orders
all that pizza

26:03.120 --> 26:06.328
and no beer
to go with it?

26:06.360 --> 26:08.021
What do you want?

26:08.060 --> 26:10.597
We're looking
for a friend.

26:10.630 --> 26:12.769
His name is Jason.

26:12.800 --> 26:14.791
I need to make
amends for something.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.091
Are you
an old drinking buddy of his?

26:16.140 --> 26:17.698
Is that what this is?

26:17.740 --> 26:19.332
This is where
Jason came to get sober

26:19.370 --> 26:21.179
when he said
he was at Clarke.

26:22.810 --> 26:24.698
When was he here?

26:32.150 --> 26:34.050
My dad's not here.

26:34.090 --> 26:35.751
You're the one
that I wanted to see.

26:37.690 --> 26:39.248
Are you leaving?

26:39.290 --> 26:41.224
Funeral's over.

26:41.260 --> 26:43.797
Mother's gone,
Dad doesn't need me.

26:43.830 --> 26:46.196
If anybody wants me,
they'll find me.

26:48.770 --> 26:50.135
Look, what happened
to your mother--

26:50.170 --> 26:52.365
My mother
had a lot of secrets.

26:52.410 --> 26:54.105
Too many.

26:54.140 --> 26:55.732
That's what
really killed her.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.236
And Alison?

26:57.280 --> 27:00.306
Alison.

27:00.350 --> 27:03.114
I come into this_ room
and see her Sitting

27:03.150 --> 27:05.789
at the piano
or catch a glimpse of her

27:05.820 --> 27:09.278
going around a corner upstairs,
and I think to myself

27:09.320 --> 27:13.222
this is What it's like
to live in a haunted house.

27:13.260 --> 27:14.955
I decided
I didn't like it.

27:19.030 --> 27:20.622
I think you need
to look at this.

27:30.040 --> 27:32.201
Your mother wrote this
the night that she died.

27:34.450 --> 27:37.749
And it doesn't matter
how I got it.

27:37.790 --> 27:40.179
Oh, I got a pretty good idea
how you got it.

27:45.960 --> 27:48.053
If Mrs. DiLaurentis didn't send
that email to Jason,

27:48.100 --> 27:49.692
then who was it for?

27:49.730 --> 27:52.164
All we know for sure
is it wasn't Jason.

27:52.200 --> 27:53.838
He was at that
dry-out place

27:53.870 --> 27:55.167
with no less than
half a dozen people

27:55.200 --> 27:57.430
the night his mom died,
and we were in New York.

27:57.470 --> 28:00.769
So he's in the clear.

28:00.810 --> 28:02.937
You sound disappointed.

28:02.980 --> 28:04.208
No.

28:04.250 --> 28:08.277
A little. I just thought
that we had something.

28:14.860 --> 28:19.422
* Babes, with four inch heels,
airbrushed nails *

28:19.460 --> 28:22.497
* At the club,
a killer babe *

28:22.530 --> 28:23.519
* Babes

28:23.560 --> 28:27.064
* Back and forth,
on the stage *

28:27.100 --> 28:30.831
* Couldn't keep my eyes off
that killer babe *

28:37.980 --> 28:40.107
* Girls, girls, girls

28:40.150 --> 28:45.941
* Women, women are babes,
killer babes *

28:45.990 --> 28:47.855
* Girls, girls, girls

28:47.890 --> 28:52.122
* Women, women are babes,
killer babes *

28:52.160 --> 28:53.991
What was it like
to come out?

28:56.830 --> 28:59.367
Where is this coming from?

28:59.400 --> 29:01.197
I just never
really asked you.

29:01.240 --> 29:05.108
I mean, What was it like
to stop being one thing

29:05.140 --> 29:08.928
and then just become
something else?

29:08.980 --> 29:11.847
_ I wasn't _
becoming something else.

29:11.880 --> 29:14.110
I was becoming
who I really am.

29:14.150 --> 29:15.469
You always knew?

29:16.550 --> 29:18.211
I couldn't admit it.

29:18.250 --> 29:19.512
But you knew?

29:21.260 --> 29:22.887
Yeah.

29:24.430 --> 29:27.183
Not me.

29:27.230 --> 29:29.198
I never knew
who the hell I was.

29:38.310 --> 29:39.902
That time stamp means
that your mother wrote

29:39.940 --> 29:41.476
that 2 hours
after the last time

29:41.510 --> 29:43.899
anybody saw her
at that police station.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.542
And she never
finished writing it.

29:45.580 --> 29:47.047
She didn't even
enter an address

29:47.080 --> 29:48.843
to Whom she meant to send.

29:48.880 --> 29:50.541
Maybe she changed her mind.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.389
What would
make her do that?

29:55.590 --> 29:58.559
What would make you
change your mind?

29:58.590 --> 30:01.491
A message like that...

30:01.530 --> 30:04.328
is something that I would
want to deliver personally.

30:04.370 --> 30:06.463
So she got up
from her computer,

30:06.500 --> 30:08.434
she walked out
the front door

30:08.470 --> 30:09.937
and she went
to go tell somebody

30:09.970 --> 30:12.165
that All was alive
and that things

30:12.210 --> 30:15.475
were falling apart faster than
anybody could fix them.

30:15.510 --> 30:18.900
Too bad she never got
to give the message.

30:18.950 --> 30:20.941
What if she did?

30:20.980 --> 30:22.948
Maybe that person,
the person she was writing to,

30:22.980 --> 30:24.413
the one that
she couldn't protect anymore,

30:24.450 --> 30:26.088
maybe that's Who killed her.

30:26.120 --> 30:28.281
Any idea
who that could be?

30:28.320 --> 30:29.355
Yeah, tons of ideas.

30:29.390 --> 30:32.951
All of them pretty nasty.

30:32.990 --> 30:36.221
There's a crealq saying
you hear a lot at the meetings:

30:36.260 --> 30:39.991
Do you want to be right
or do you want to be happy?

30:43.500 --> 30:45.468
I don't have that choice.

30:45.510 --> 30:46.465
I never did.

30:46.510 --> 30:48.205
Cut your losses, Spencer.

30:48.240 --> 30:50.208
Get out
while you still can.

30:54.350 --> 30:58.047
Then remember,
you can't trust him.

31:00.120 --> 31:01.656
I can't trust who?

31:01.690 --> 31:03.988
Our father.

31:13.130 --> 31:15.132
I'm glad
you were on that roof.

31:15.170 --> 31:17.092
You saved us.
Thank you.

31:17.140 --> 31:18.539
You're welcome.

31:18.570 --> 31:21.130
We were scared
that you were gonna die, Ezra.

31:21.180 --> 31:23.535
So was I.

31:23.580 --> 31:26.208
I'm glad you didn't.

31:26.250 --> 31:29.970
Why are you here,
Alison, With that?

31:30.020 --> 31:31.578
Aria let me read it.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.987
I was looking
for something.

31:36.020 --> 31:38.227
Did you find it?

31:38.260 --> 31:39.249
Not all of it.

31:39.290 --> 31:41.599
Not what I need to know
if I'm gonna stay alive.

31:44.700 --> 31:46.622
There's more, isn't there?

31:48.170 --> 31:50.559
All the watching,
all the listening that you did.

31:52.370 --> 31:54.930
You didn't destroy all of it.
You couldn't have.

31:54.980 --> 31:57.107
If there was anything left,

31:57.140 --> 31:59.938
the only thing preventing me
from burning it

31:59.980 --> 32:02.278
is the possibility
that it would help Aria,

32:02.320 --> 32:03.947
if she would let me help.

32:05.690 --> 32:08.215
Well, then you better
keep it in a safe place.

32:15.360 --> 32:17.453
Did Aria know
you were coming here?

32:19.700 --> 32:20.724
No.

32:20.770 --> 32:22.988
Tell her.

32:23.040 --> 32:24.064
Absolute honesty?

32:25.540 --> 32:27.735
That's all I got left.

32:27.770 --> 32:29.328
I hope it's enough.

32:37.380 --> 32:38.586
Do you want
anything to eat?

32:38.620 --> 32:40.247
No, just coffee.

32:40.290 --> 32:41.587
You're gonna have
a coffee this late?

32:41.620 --> 32:44.350
Seven-tenths of my body
is made up of caffeine.

32:44.390 --> 32:46.483
I have _to maintain
a con5istent level.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.427
Order for me?

32:57.640 --> 32:59.039
Hi there, girly-girl.

32:59.070 --> 33:00.298
I need to ask you
a question.

33:00.340 --> 33:01.602
Shoot

33:01.640 --> 33:03.335
Metaphorically speaking.

33:03.380 --> 33:04.449
When you and I
were going through

33:04.480 --> 33:07.574
glamour boot camp together,
you knew Ali was alive.

33:07.610 --> 33:09.043
Is that what she told you?

33:09.080 --> 33:10.240
Well,
it's the truth, isn't it?

33:12.620 --> 33:14.451
The point is she was gone.

33:14.490 --> 33:17.050
That could either create a hole
or an opportunity for you and me

33:17.090 --> 33:18.352
to help each other
up the pyramid.

33:18.390 --> 33:21.757
You didn't help me,
you changed me.

33:21.800 --> 33:24.098
You made me dye my hair,
you made me wear her clothes,

33:24.130 --> 33:25.620
you made me
walk like her, talk like her.

33:25.670 --> 33:29.436
And exactly how much pushback
did I get from you on that?

33:29.470 --> 33:31.768
Ali was gone,
but you wanted her back.

33:31.810 --> 33:34.370
Why?

33:34.410 --> 33:37.470
Reality check? You didn't
like being Hefty Hanna

33:37.510 --> 33:39.649
anymore than I liked
being Loser Mona.

33:39.680 --> 33:41.375
How about
a little gratitude?

33:41.420 --> 33:43.308
Gratitude for What?

33:43.350 --> 33:45.545
IfI hadn't given you
the All upgrade,

33:45.590 --> 33:46.784
where would you be?

33:46.820 --> 33:50.085
I'd still be me.

33:50.120 --> 33:51.724
And Who remembers her?

33:51.760 --> 33:53.557
Not even you.

33:58.670 --> 33:59.967
And then Emily texts
from the car that Jason

34:00.000 --> 34:03.265
has an alibi for What happened
in New York and Rosewood.

34:03.300 --> 34:04.665
Wait.
Jason actually told you

34:04.710 --> 34:06.666
that you shouldn't
trust your own father?

34:06.710 --> 34:07.836
More than that.

34:07.870 --> 34:09.531
He made it seem_ like
Mrs. D was writing

34:09.580 --> 34:11.468
to my dad,
"I can't protect you anymore."

34:11.510 --> 34:12.545
That's crazy.

34:12.580 --> 34:13.672
Well, crazy, as you know,

34:13.710 --> 34:16.042
around_h_ere
works on a sliding scale.

34:19.120 --> 34:20.542
I mean, look,
I know that I didn't kill

34:20.590 --> 34:22.558
that girl in Ali's grave,
I know that.

34:22.590 --> 34:25.388
But I can't prove it
and I really think

34:25.430 --> 34:28.319
that my parents
don't believe me.

34:28.360 --> 34:31.124
They wouldn't do anything
about that, would they?

34:32.530 --> 34:35.169
That's a very
interesting question,

34:35.200 --> 34:37.134
and I will have to get back
to you on it.

34:41.910 --> 34:45.505
I'm so sorry
you had to go talk to Ezra.

34:45.550 --> 34:48.519
Yeah, well, we had to know

34:48.550 --> 34:51.110
what he was going to say
about New York.

34:51.150 --> 34:53.710
But somebody else
could have gone and done that.

34:53.750 --> 34:55.581
No, not really.

34:57.290 --> 34:59.679
Are you okay?

34:59.730 --> 35:02.119
Do you need anything?

35:02.160 --> 35:04.367
Yeah, I need to know
that it didn't happen.

35:06.230 --> 35:07.720
Shana in the theater.

35:11.770 --> 35:13.328
But it did.

35:32.290 --> 35:33.427
Alison?

35:35.400 --> 35:39.359
Hey, I thought
that was you. Wasn't sure.

35:39.400 --> 35:41.231
Hello, Mr. Hastings.

35:41.270 --> 35:44.637
How are you doing?
You holding up?

35:44.670 --> 35:46.433
I'm fine.

35:46.470 --> 35:47.459
Thanks.

35:47.510 --> 35:48.772
That's good.

35:48.810 --> 35:50.937
I'm a little surprised
to see you out here

35:50.980 --> 35:53.869
all by yourself.

35:53.910 --> 35:56.378
_ I can't hide
in my room forever.

35:56.420 --> 35:57.773
Even if I'm still scared
I have to get out

35:57.820 --> 35:59.549
or else I never will.

35:59.590 --> 36:01.854
Yeah, but you have police
at the house, right?

36:01.890 --> 36:04.222
I do.

36:04.260 --> 36:05.522
But I know my way
around this town

36:05.560 --> 36:07.858
better than any cop.

36:07.890 --> 36:11.291
I can get out
if I want to.

36:11.330 --> 36:15.266
Yeah, maybe,
but under the circumstances,

36:15.300 --> 36:18.906
I think it'd be a good idea
ifI gave you a ride home.

36:42.860 --> 36:44.623
Does my mom know
you're out here?

36:45.870 --> 36:47.565
She said
I could wait inside.

36:47.600 --> 36:49.238
I told her
I was okay here.

36:52.470 --> 36:53.903
Your mom knows
we're fighting.

36:53.940 --> 36:56.431
We're not fighting.

36:56.480 --> 36:57.731
We're done fighting.

36:57.780 --> 36:59.407
Which makes us what?

37:01.620 --> 37:07.411
We go to the same school,
we used to be teammates,

37:07.450 --> 37:09.452
maybe we'll be friends.

37:12.490 --> 37:14.390
I practiced
what I'm gonna say to you.

37:14.430 --> 37:15.499
Did you know that?

37:17.760 --> 37:20.490
I talked to myself
the whole way over here.

37:20.530 --> 37:23.431
I'm pretty convincing.

37:23.470 --> 37:28.498
Then I get to this porch
and I forget everything.

37:28.540 --> 37:34.513
All I can say is,
"I love you."

37:34.550 --> 37:38.589
Like if I say it just right,
it'll fix things.

37:38.620 --> 37:40.611
Somehow you'll hear it
differently this time

37:40.650 --> 37:43.881
and everything
will be all right.

37:46.060 --> 37:47.584
I'm sorry.

37:50.630 --> 37:52.769
That doesn't sound
very good.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.264
I better go.

38:04.880 --> 38:05.949
Paige...

38:12.820 --> 38:14.515
You deserve
the best of everything.

38:16.490 --> 38:17.684
That's what I had.

38:31.970 --> 38:33.961
Where have you been
at this hour, young man?

38:36.040 --> 38:37.837
Okay, hear me out.

38:37.880 --> 38:39.939
Pretzels
that I Will share With you

38:39.980 --> 38:41.538
if you don't tell
your mother.

38:41.580 --> 38:43.616
Deal.

38:43.650 --> 38:45.481
You know the world's
in a sorry state

38:45.520 --> 38:48.978
when I have to _make
a secret out of eating salt.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.455
Mrs. DiLaurentis wrote
this the night that she died

38:57.500 --> 38:59.866
after she got back
from the police station.

38:59.900 --> 39:01.060
She never sent it.

39:01.100 --> 39:02.636
I think she wanted
to deliver it in person

39:02.670 --> 39:04.467
and that's Why she's dead.

39:10.010 --> 39:11.477
Is this a magic trick?

39:11.510 --> 39:12.477
Are you going
to make it disappear?

39:12.510 --> 39:14.046
This doesn't mean anything.

39:14.080 --> 39:16.048
Every thing means
something, Dad.

39:16.080 --> 39:17.809
Who was
she trying to protect

39:17.850 --> 39:19.613
and Why did she suddenly
feel like she had to stop?

39:19.650 --> 39:22.118
Was it because
Alison was alive?

39:22.160 --> 39:23.957
Who was
she writing this to?

39:23.990 --> 39:26.129
Leave him alone.

39:26.160 --> 39:27.559
We're having
a conversation.

39:27.590 --> 39:29.797
I know what your idea
of a conversation is.

39:34.100 --> 39:35.533
Don't worry about that.

39:42.540 --> 39:44.440
Oh,
that's a grand gesture,

39:44.480 --> 39:46.607
but it_doe_sn't amount
to anything in a digital age.

39:46.650 --> 39:48.049
This woman was crazy.

39:48.080 --> 39:49.513
She was crazy and afraid.

39:49.550 --> 39:52.041
Enough! Both of you.

39:52.090 --> 39:54.012
People are dead,
you two are acting like

39:54.050 --> 39:58.089
cranlq little 5-year-olds
on the way back from the beach.

39:58.120 --> 40:00.429
No more friendly fire.

40:00.460 --> 40:01.893
Have I made myself clear?

40:01.930 --> 40:03.420
Dad,
maybe we should tell her.

40:03.460 --> 40:04.893
No. Don't.

40:07.230 --> 40:08.663
Spencer, go upstairs.

40:08.700 --> 40:09.689
What?

40:09.740 --> 40:11.162
Go upstairs.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.633
You've got to be
kidding me.

40:12.670 --> 40:14.706
Do I look like
I'm kidding?

40:14.740 --> 40:17.675
Maybe that's a good idea,
Spencen

40:17.710 --> 40:18.938
What is going on?

40:18.980 --> 40:20.641
It's complicated.

40:20.680 --> 40:22.773
No, actually, it's simple.

40:24.550 --> 40:27.417
You can't lie about something
you don't know anything about.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.662
I meant to warn you
that Alison might stop by.

40:40.700 --> 40:43.066
I just didn't think
that she'd move so fast.

40:43.100 --> 40:44.636
I just heard
a knock on the door

40:44.670 --> 40:46.137
and I thought
it might be you.

40:46.170 --> 40:47.706
I don't know why.

40:50.080 --> 40:53.072
I honestly thought
I would never see you again.

40:53.110 --> 40:55.544
Yeah, I was kind of thinking
the same thing.

40:57.550 --> 41:01.509
But here I am once again,
back at the scene of the crime.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.050
There's no crime here.

41:03.090 --> 41:05.229
Not the way I see it.

41:05.260 --> 41:08.229
Look, Ezra,
I didn't just come over here

41:08.260 --> 41:10.091
to warn you about Alison.

41:12.170 --> 41:13.728
Icame here _
to tell you something

41:13.770 --> 41:15.067
that I should have
told you before.

41:15.100 --> 41:16.658
Aria, you don't need
to tell me anything.

41:16.700 --> 41:18.907
No, listen.

41:18.940 --> 41:21.135
You don't have to worry
about Shana anymore.

41:22.910 --> 41:24.468
She's dead.

41:26.610 --> 41:28.874
And I know that she's dead,
because I'm responsible.

41:31.120 --> 41:33.588
Wh-What do you mean
"responsible"?

41:33.620 --> 41:36.111
I mean that I killed her...

41:37.960 --> 41:39.757
in New York
after I left the hospital.

41:39.790 --> 41:44.227
I just meant to stop her.
I never meant to kill her.

41:44.260 --> 41:47.093
Anyway, that's What
I've been telling myself.

41:47.130 --> 41:50.099
But it was just
in that moment,

41:50.140 --> 41:51.801
I don't know.

42:04.850 --> 42:06.215
How can I help?

42:10.790 --> 42:13.020
Same shade of blonde
this time?

42:13.060 --> 42:15.824
No, not the same.

42:15.860 --> 42:17.157
It's time for a change.

42:17.200 --> 42:19.919
* Everything that
you promise now *

42:19.970 --> 42:21.892
* It's all a lie

42:24.670 --> 42:27.230
* All the pleasure
that you purchase now *

42:27.270 --> 42:30.307
* It's all a lie

42:31.980 --> 42:34.778
* Every story
that I'm hearin' now *

42:34.820 --> 42:37.038
* It's all a lie

42:37.080 --> 42:38.889
*Alie

42:38.920 --> 42:42.048
* And everything
about her style *

42:42.090 --> 42:43.910
* It's all a lie

42:43.960 --> 42:46.781
* Lie, lie, lie

42:46.830 --> 42:49.094
* ( song continues
indistinct *
