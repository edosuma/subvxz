WEBVTT

00:00.801 --> 00:02.002
* Previously in my life...

00:53.421 --> 00:54.755
He went in there.

00:54.788 --> 00:55.756
Who did? Kevin?

00:55.789 --> 00:57.525
Yeah, after
we let him go.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.127
What is it,
a Senate office?

00:59.160 --> 01:00.328
No, I don't think so.

01:00.361 --> 01:02.196
He's been in there
since yesterday.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.265
You've been down
here since...?
Oh, no.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.234
Gustav put a tracker
on his phone.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.370
What do you think?

01:28.189 --> 01:29.790
(buzzer sounds)

01:30.791 --> 01:31.859
Yeah?

01:31.892 --> 01:34.728
Room 54?

01:34.762 --> 01:36.164
From who?

01:36.197 --> 01:37.365
I have no idea.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.300
I was just told to deliver it.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.701
The beds can be more narrow...

01:42.903 --> 01:44.605
Thanks.

01:47.841 --> 01:49.710
SRB-54.

01:49.743 --> 01:50.911
What is that?

01:50.944 --> 01:52.380
A room in the basement.

01:52.413 --> 01:54.615
Okay. Why are we
talking about it?

01:54.648 --> 01:56.384
Because it's a war room.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.352
Uh, for who?

01:58.386 --> 02:00.154
No, it's not a war room
for a candidate.

02:00.188 --> 02:01.755
It's a war room for a war.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.625
And how do you know this?

02:04.658 --> 02:07.795
One of the Syrian dissidents
who testified at your hearing--

02:07.828 --> 02:10.531
Dr. Samira-- he was there.

02:11.565 --> 02:13.334
Hmm.

02:16.537 --> 02:19.273
(clears throat)

02:19.307 --> 02:20.808
Hey, Judy.
How you doing?

02:20.841 --> 02:22.576
No, no. No, I'm fine
with the office.

02:22.610 --> 02:23.911
I'm starting to like it.

02:23.944 --> 02:27.515
But I got a delivery
from someone in SRB...

02:27.548 --> 02:29.417
54.
...54.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.319
Uh, whose office is that?

02:34.488 --> 02:35.923
Wait, are you sure?

02:35.956 --> 02:38.158
I have the package right here.
I mean...

02:39.960 --> 02:43.331
Judy, come on. Are you
telling me there is no SRB-54?

02:46.300 --> 02:48.302
Okay. Thanks.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.842
(sighs)

03:00.348 --> 03:01.649
(buzzer sounds)

03:04.252 --> 03:05.419
Yes?

03:05.453 --> 03:06.687
Excuse me.

03:06.720 --> 03:07.955
I'm here to meet
with the senator.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.390
There is no senator
here, sir.

03:09.423 --> 03:10.591
Red told me to meet him here.

03:10.624 --> 03:13.227
Are you sure?
Very sure.

03:13.261 --> 03:14.995
Well, he's not
here, Senator.

03:15.028 --> 03:15.996
LUKE:
And who are you?

03:16.029 --> 03:16.997
Don.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.632
Don who?
Don Pickle.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.534
Pickle, really?
That's your name?

03:20.568 --> 03:22.336
Yes, sir.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.372
And your position, Mr. Pickle?

03:24.405 --> 03:25.773
Legislative aide.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.241
To whom?

03:27.275 --> 03:29.810
I'm a little busy, Senator.

03:29.843 --> 03:32.313
With what?
You can't just take...

03:33.314 --> 03:34.615
...a room.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.717
Sorry, Senator.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.520
We're busy here.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.591
What are you thinking?

03:45.826 --> 03:47.528
MONARCH:
...allegations have been made

03:47.561 --> 03:49.397
about Syrian involvement
with American bioterrorism...

03:49.430 --> 03:50.464
What is it?
A leak.

03:50.498 --> 03:53.000
...but now I personally
have received confirmation

03:53.033 --> 03:56.304
that the testimony by Syrian
dissidents was completely bogus.

03:56.337 --> 03:58.972
In fact, a source close
to the committee has told me

03:59.006 --> 04:02.976
exclusively that CIA official
Sidney Tellefsen

04:03.010 --> 04:05.713
briefed the committee
that there is no link

04:05.746 --> 04:08.982
between Syria and
these recent head explosions.

04:09.016 --> 04:11.819
So, if there's no connection,
why is Red

04:11.852 --> 04:13.454
out there misleading the public?

04:13.487 --> 04:16.424
This briefing today
stunned me.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.959
In all my 20 years as a senator,

04:18.992 --> 04:22.062
I've never been so shocked
as by what I heard today.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.533
MISTY: So was there something
shocking in the CIA briefing?

04:25.566 --> 04:27.067
Or has it been overblown?

04:27.100 --> 04:29.670
Obviously, Democrats will
make hay with this statement.

04:29.703 --> 04:30.904
(knocks)

04:34.107 --> 04:36.344
GARETH:
Senator, are you all right?

04:36.377 --> 04:38.479
Yeah. What do you mean?
The news--

04:38.512 --> 04:39.480
you heard it?

04:39.513 --> 04:41.615
Well, which part?

04:41.649 --> 04:42.850
The CIA briefing.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.885
Oh, the leak?
Yes, sir.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.019
Do you want me
to work up a statement?

04:46.053 --> 04:47.888
No.
You sure?

04:47.921 --> 04:49.623
They're saying you lied
about the CIA briefing.

04:49.657 --> 04:50.824
What's the name
of the new intern?

04:50.858 --> 04:52.493
Jed.
Jed! Jed the intern!

04:52.526 --> 04:55.363
Yes, sir? Yes, sir.

04:55.396 --> 04:56.864
Wow. Mr. Enthusiasm.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.866
Sorry. I guess I am.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.634
(chuckles) Send Ashley in.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.069
And get me another one of these.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.937
Yes, sir, right away.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.839
(chuckles)

05:05.873 --> 05:07.541
How long do you think
he'll last?

05:07.575 --> 05:08.909
Ah, he's a good kid.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.378
His parents gave
to the campaign.

05:10.411 --> 05:11.712
Oh, good to know.

05:11.745 --> 05:15.082
Ashley, my favorite
African-American person,

05:15.115 --> 05:16.784
how are you?

05:16.817 --> 05:18.051
Good, Senator.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.086
Good. Good.

05:19.119 --> 05:21.722
Gareth, this is
Ashley Cook.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.123
Ex-capitol police,
now working as, uh...

05:23.156 --> 05:25.426
What do you
call yourself?

05:25.459 --> 05:27.395
Freelance investigative analyst.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.530
Right. Right.

05:29.563 --> 05:32.733
Ashley is helping us out
with our little problem here.

05:32.766 --> 05:33.934
Who leaked.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.603
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
I know who leaked.

05:35.636 --> 05:38.105
Luke Healy leaked. He's the
only one with a motive.

05:38.138 --> 05:41.942
Senator Healy has had affairs
with several Hill staffers.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.411
Do you want a rundown?

05:43.444 --> 05:45.112
Senator, do you want me to go?
No, no.

05:45.145 --> 05:47.080
No, no. You should be
in on this, too.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.483
We don't need a verbal
on the affairs.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.552
But I do want you to
expand the search.

05:51.585 --> 05:52.853
Hmm. Into his financials?

05:52.886 --> 05:54.855
No. Into his sister.

05:54.888 --> 05:57.124
I want oppo research
on her, too:

05:57.157 --> 05:58.826
what skeletons she
has in her closet,

05:58.859 --> 06:02.095
gambling debts, affairs

06:02.129 --> 06:03.731
with...

06:03.764 --> 06:05.466
professors,

06:05.499 --> 06:06.800
porn addictions.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.836
Okay. I'm on it.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.740
It's a good idea,
don't you think, buddy?

06:12.773 --> 06:15.876
Yeah. The girl works
in her brother's office.

06:15.909 --> 06:18.178
We should find out
what she's up to, too.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.581
If that's what you want,
Senator.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.015
It is.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.717
So go ahead.

06:23.751 --> 06:26.854
Help facilitate Ashley.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.691
Yes, Senator.

06:30.724 --> 06:31.725
(door closes)

06:35.696 --> 06:37.397
(sighs)

06:38.799 --> 06:41.569
(desk phone ringing)

06:41.602 --> 06:42.770
Hello?

06:42.803 --> 06:45.639
Oh, Laurel, hi. I was just...

06:45.673 --> 06:48.075
Yes, I do have a minute.

06:48.108 --> 06:50.478
Okay, the Smithsonian.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.480
20 minutes.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.482
(loud chatter, gavel bangs)

06:54.515 --> 06:58.486
Can we please, please,
stick to the point?!

06:58.519 --> 07:00.688
What is the point?

07:00.721 --> 07:04.157
The point is: there
is no reason for war.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.059
Syria is not the reason

07:06.093 --> 07:07.661
for these Catastrophic
Head Injuries.
(door opens)

07:07.695 --> 07:09.162
RED: No, no, no,
the point is this:

07:09.196 --> 07:12.633
The CIA briefed four of us

07:12.666 --> 07:15.035
on the status
of their investigation--

07:15.068 --> 07:17.905
myself, Senator Pollack, Senator
Vaynerchuk, and you, Luke.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.673
And one of us leaked!

07:19.707 --> 07:22.643
Don't-don't try to
change the subject, Red.

07:22.676 --> 07:25.212
You went in front of the press
and lied about that briefing.

07:25.245 --> 07:26.780
That is the true outrage here.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.181
So that's why you leaked?

07:28.215 --> 07:29.950
I did not leak.
Look, you told the press

07:29.983 --> 07:31.552
you were shocked
by the briefing.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.186
Because I was shocked.
I'm still shocked!

07:33.220 --> 07:35.789
You implied the CIA
showed us evidence

07:35.823 --> 07:38.225
that supported
your move toward war.
RED: No, no, no,

07:38.258 --> 07:40.528
no, no, no, I was shocked

07:40.561 --> 07:42.796
because the Syrians were behind
these head explosions!

07:42.830 --> 07:44.965
Oh, my God, it's
Alice in Wonderland.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.199
RED:
Madam Chairwoman,

07:46.233 --> 07:48.636
I ask that
this committee censure

07:48.669 --> 07:50.170
and commence
criminal proceedings

07:50.203 --> 07:52.072
against Senator Healy
for leaking.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.174
I did not leak.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.944
And I ask this committee to
assign a special prosecutor...

07:56.977 --> 07:58.712
ELLA: If someone
is to prosecute,

07:58.746 --> 08:00.548
I nominate Lawrence Boch.

08:00.581 --> 08:01.949
He's a former senator,

08:01.982 --> 08:03.784
he's respected
on both sides of the aisle.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.586
RED: I have
my disagreements with Boch,

08:05.619 --> 08:09.690
but I can overcome them
in the spirit of bipartisanship.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.525
What bipartisanship?

08:11.559 --> 08:13.694
This is not about a leak;
this is about warmongering.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.696
I thank Red.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.898
And I think we should
nominate Lawrence Boch

08:17.931 --> 08:20.734
as special prosecutor
immediately.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.304
RED:
Thank you, Ella.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.707
I don't agree
with you on much,

08:26.740 --> 08:29.810
but this committee
cannot afford more leaks!

08:31.945 --> 08:33.747
What are you doing?

08:33.781 --> 08:35.649
How can you be
on his side?

08:35.683 --> 08:37.951
Poor Luke.

08:37.985 --> 08:40.588
We're playing
a different game now.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.022
Try to keep up.

08:52.633 --> 08:55.268
Is Red running a war room
out of SRB-54?

08:55.302 --> 08:57.738
I... What?

08:57.771 --> 08:59.573
Is your boss
running a war room

08:59.607 --> 09:00.941
out of the Russell
Building basement?

09:00.974 --> 09:02.876
I have no idea.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.344
Where are you
getting this?
Downstairs.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.879
Go look.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.581
SRB-54.
Okay.

09:07.615 --> 09:10.017
I'll look.
Good.

09:10.050 --> 09:13.286
What'd you want
to talk about?

09:13.320 --> 09:15.623
Red's expanded his
oppo research team.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.090
It's not just looking
into your brother.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.358
It's looking
into you, too.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.761
Me?

09:20.794 --> 09:22.095
Really?

09:22.129 --> 09:24.297
Yeah.
Why me?

09:24.331 --> 09:27.000
I think Red is
worried about you.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.969
Well, I'm honored.

09:29.002 --> 09:32.305
(chuckles): I don't
know if you should be.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.842
Is there anything in your
past that can hurt you?

09:34.875 --> 09:37.645
What? You mean like recreational
drug use in college?

09:37.678 --> 09:40.047
Yes.
(chuckles)

09:40.080 --> 09:42.182
But anything
more recent?

09:42.215 --> 09:46.019
Well, I am currently sleeping
with someone I shouldn't be.

09:47.888 --> 09:50.658
A Hill staffer from
the other side of the aisle.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.192
Yeah. That's not good.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.927
I should probably
break it off, right?

09:53.961 --> 09:55.328
Yeah.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.230
Maybe not yet.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.836
I want you right now.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.205
Where?

10:05.238 --> 10:07.207
Anywhere.

10:11.044 --> 10:13.781
Have you ever been
to the planetarium?

10:16.216 --> 10:18.185
(dramatic music playing)

10:18.218 --> 10:20.020
PLANETARIUM NARRATOR:
After a star's demise,

10:20.053 --> 10:22.690
its fragments join
with other space matter

10:22.723 --> 10:25.058
to form a gigantic
gaseous nebula.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.894
Say it.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.161
It's a climactic explosion...

10:28.195 --> 10:30.430
"My gaseous nebula."

10:30.463 --> 10:32.866
(whispering):
Your gaseous...

10:33.967 --> 10:35.235
...nebula.

10:35.268 --> 10:36.704
NARRATOR:
The nebula disintegrates

10:36.737 --> 10:38.038
in spectacular fashion,

10:38.071 --> 10:40.040
leaving in its wake
a spinning ring

10:40.073 --> 10:41.909
of overheated material.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.711
It's a climactic explosion,

10:43.744 --> 10:45.879
one that results
in a shock wave...

10:46.947 --> 10:48.048
Senator Healy,

10:48.081 --> 10:49.917
do you have a moment?

10:49.950 --> 10:51.852
Lawrence Boch.
(chuckles)

10:51.885 --> 10:52.986
Very nice to meet you.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.121
And you.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.355
Oh, I respected
your father.

10:55.388 --> 10:56.456
Well...

10:56.489 --> 10:58.325
And as you're no doubt aware,

10:58.358 --> 11:00.193
I've been asked to be
a special prosecutor

11:00.227 --> 11:01.428
on this leak case.

11:01.461 --> 11:04.297
Yes, yeah. Please, sit down.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.734
No. Uh, if you don't mind,
I'll... I'll stand.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.401
I'm-I'm having
some health issues.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.738
(chuckles): If I sit,
I might not get up again.

11:10.771 --> 11:13.140
So, let me just say this first.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.441
I know you leaked.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.744
You do?

11:16.777 --> 11:19.012
You don't want to talk, Senator.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.347
You want to hire a lawyer.

11:20.380 --> 11:23.016
See, even your
two words, "You do?"

11:23.050 --> 11:25.018
I could use that
to prosecute you.

11:25.052 --> 11:27.354
And I'm not a bad guy,
but, you know, they've given me

11:27.387 --> 11:30.190
a two million dollar budget
to prosecute someone.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.760
(chuckles):
And... and my guess is

11:32.793 --> 11:35.796
is that somebody is you,
so hire a lawyer.

11:35.829 --> 11:36.964
Don't say anything else.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.332
And... if I didn't do it?

11:40.934 --> 11:42.035
Well, that'd be good.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.336
Right.
(chuckles)

11:43.370 --> 11:45.438
But, uh, you know,
two million dollars is

11:45.472 --> 11:47.207
a lot of money,
so, you know,

11:47.240 --> 11:49.209
I'm gonna have to bring
them somebody's head

11:49.242 --> 11:50.243
to justify that budget.

11:50.277 --> 11:51.779
I didn't do it.
(stutters)

11:51.812 --> 11:54.247
See, I'm-I'm gonna interrupt
you there, Senator.

11:54.281 --> 11:57.084
I'm interviewing you
at noon tomorrow.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.919
I'd suggest you have
a lawyer there.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.088
I'm also interviewing
your staff,

12:01.121 --> 12:04.057
including your sister,
tomorrow at 3:00.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.894
Yes, your sister.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.196
(chuckles):
See, I... I find it surprising

12:09.229 --> 12:11.498
that the ethics committee agreed

12:11.531 --> 12:14.201
to let you hire
a relation on staff,

12:14.234 --> 12:16.937
so I'd tell your sister
to get a lawyer, too.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.273
Anyway, that's it.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.009
And it's, uh, nice
meeting you, Senator.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.044
(clears throat)

12:26.413 --> 12:28.748
Nice meeting you, too.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.785
(indistinct conversation)

12:36.957 --> 12:38.992
(knock on door)

12:42.329 --> 12:44.131
Yes?

12:44.164 --> 12:45.298
I'm Gareth Ritter.

12:45.332 --> 12:46.566
I'm Red Wheatus's
chief of staff.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.869
Oh, hi. What do you need?

12:48.902 --> 12:50.470
To know what goes on
in this room.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.840
Talk to Red.
We're a little busy.

12:54.341 --> 12:55.976
I'm Red's chief of staff.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.544
Oh.
What's your position?

12:57.577 --> 12:58.946
Legislative director.

12:58.979 --> 12:59.947
Oh.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.415
Then I outrank you, so...

13:02.449 --> 13:03.817
step aside.

13:03.851 --> 13:06.119
Not with this.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.254
I'm sorry.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.227
Hello.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.864
I have some research
we should discuss.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.131
We?
Yes.

13:18.165 --> 13:19.366
Senator Wheatus
asked that I run

13:19.399 --> 13:20.901
all my research
through you.
Okay.

13:20.934 --> 13:23.170
This is information
on sexual relationships

13:23.203 --> 13:24.404
involving Luke Healy.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.406
Thanks.
It's kind of thick.

13:26.439 --> 13:27.975
Yes.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.177
And this is the information
on sexual relations

13:30.210 --> 13:31.811
involving Laurel Healy.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.547
This file?

13:34.581 --> 13:37.017
Yes.
Huh.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.186
Looks like you've gone
into a lot of detail.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.889
No. In fact, I have
the supporting information here.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.292
Would you like me
to take you through it?

13:45.325 --> 13:47.527
No, no.
Think I can handle that.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.528
Thanks.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.397
I should be back
with more.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.199
Great.

14:15.222 --> 14:17.224
*

14:27.600 --> 14:29.169
You wanted to see me, Mr. Boch?

14:29.202 --> 14:30.170
Yes, ma'am.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.404
I-I just have one question.

14:31.438 --> 14:34.607
And I warn you: you can have
a lawyer present when I ask it.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.176
(chuckles)

14:36.209 --> 14:38.011
Why don't you ask
the question first,

14:38.045 --> 14:39.546
and then I'll decide.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.281
All right.

14:41.314 --> 14:43.450
Well, who leaked the contents
of the select committee

14:43.483 --> 14:44.918
CIA briefing to you?

14:44.952 --> 14:46.386
I don't need a lawyer for that.

14:46.419 --> 14:49.189
The leak came from
a confidential source,

14:49.222 --> 14:51.591
and I cannot be compelled
under the First Amendment

14:51.624 --> 14:53.426
to reveal their identity.
(chuckles)

14:53.460 --> 14:55.262
Ma'am, you understand
that, under the law,

14:55.295 --> 14:57.931
there is no
such protection.

14:57.965 --> 14:59.967
You must answer my question.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.935
Who leaked to you?

15:03.536 --> 15:06.139
Mr. Boch, I will not
answer that question,

15:06.173 --> 15:08.008
nor will I ever
answer that question.

15:08.041 --> 15:11.678
Well, gentlemen, I ask that you
place Ms. Monarch under arrest.

15:22.722 --> 15:25.325
And how's your dad?

15:25.358 --> 15:26.994
Good.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.595
He was the one
who recommended you.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.063
Dean.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.564
I miss Dean.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.733
Hug him for me.
I will.

15:33.766 --> 15:37.470
And now the legal problems
have passed to the son.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.606
Yes.

15:39.639 --> 15:42.475
I've been accused of leaking.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.677
The special prosecutor
intends to question me tomorrow.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.346
Who is the special prosecutor?

15:46.379 --> 15:48.081
Lawrence Boch.
Oh.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.349
Look, I didn't leak.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.284
Then you have nothing
to worry about.

15:51.318 --> 15:54.721
Unfortunately...
I think I know who did.

15:54.754 --> 15:58.091
That still might not cause
a problem for you,

15:58.125 --> 15:59.292
unless...

15:59.326 --> 16:00.760
I think my sister leaked.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.163
And you told her?
Yes.

16:03.196 --> 16:04.331
(groans)

16:07.534 --> 16:09.402
Why did you leak to your sister?

16:09.436 --> 16:11.704
I was trying to figure out
whether to leak myself.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.106
I decided against it, but...

16:13.140 --> 16:14.007
Hold on.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.108
Do you need anything

16:15.142 --> 16:16.243
from me, Senator?

16:16.276 --> 16:18.145
No, thank you.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.459
Look, I was tempted to leak

16:32.492 --> 16:34.061
because Senator Wheatus
was lying

16:34.094 --> 16:36.263
about the CIA briefing
and pushing us to war.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.298
So, you asked
your sister's opinion?

16:38.331 --> 16:39.799
And my father's.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.069
Oh!

16:42.102 --> 16:43.403
Anybody else?

16:43.436 --> 16:44.537
No.

16:44.571 --> 16:45.805
What, I'm in trouble?

16:45.838 --> 16:47.674
Yes.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.409
I'll need to talk
to your sister.

16:49.442 --> 16:50.677
I'm not cutting
her loose.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.545
I know.

16:52.579 --> 16:56.683
If the special prosecutor found
out you leaked to your sister,

16:56.716 --> 16:58.718
you could be sentenced
to eight years in prison.

17:01.854 --> 17:06.726
Don't talk to Lawrence Boch
again without me there.

17:06.759 --> 17:09.429
And... I'll talk to your sister.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.467
You okay?

17:14.501 --> 17:16.603
Yeah.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.205
You don't like
my quesadillas?

17:18.238 --> 17:21.374
No, I love your
quesadillas.

17:21.408 --> 17:23.776
Good, 'cause that's the only
food I know how to make.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.245
(chuckles)

17:27.580 --> 17:29.249
Okay, what?

17:29.282 --> 17:30.550
What?

17:30.583 --> 17:32.519
This is about
your oppo research, clearly.

17:32.552 --> 17:33.420
Look at you.

17:33.453 --> 17:35.855
You're judging me.
I am not judging you.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.258
I'm just trying to keep Red
from using stuff against you.

17:38.291 --> 17:39.592
What stuff?

17:39.626 --> 17:41.561
You want to do this?

17:41.594 --> 17:43.730
Oh, I'm raring to do this.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.498
Okay.

17:45.532 --> 17:47.400
Did you sleep with your poly sci
professor at Georgetown,

17:47.434 --> 17:49.569
and did he get you pregnant,
and did you have an abortion?

17:51.571 --> 17:53.373
That's a compound question.

17:53.406 --> 17:56.643
Yes, it is. Do you want me
to break it down into parts?

17:56.676 --> 17:57.777
That could be fun.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.546
Go for it.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.848
Is any part of it true?
No, no.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.616
Start with the abortion.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.652
Did I kill a baby--
that's what you want to know.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.687
(sighs)

18:16.896 --> 18:19.132
I slept with my
poly sci professor,

18:19.166 --> 18:20.900
Cultural Revolution 101,
Colin Handke,

18:20.933 --> 18:22.735
but I didn't get pregnant.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.505
They're saying you slept
with him to get a good grade.

18:25.538 --> 18:26.506
Did they show you the grade?

18:26.539 --> 18:28.341
No.
It was a B-minus.

18:28.375 --> 18:29.642
(chuckles)

18:29.676 --> 18:31.911
That doesn't say much
about me, does it?

18:31.944 --> 18:33.346
I should stop doing this.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.382
No. What else
did I do wrong?

18:35.415 --> 18:37.150
How many people did I
sleep with in college?

18:37.184 --> 18:38.385
Let's drop it, okay?

18:38.418 --> 18:39.686
No, how many?
It's not a good idea.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.388
How many did they
say I slept with?

18:41.421 --> 18:43.223
Twenty-four.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.791
Really?

18:44.824 --> 18:46.259
Mm-hmm.

18:46.293 --> 18:47.527
Are those confirmed kills?

18:47.560 --> 18:48.795
You asked.

18:48.828 --> 18:49.796
You're right.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.764
You're right, I did.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.800
Help me correct the record.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.403
No.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.271
Tell me how many
it should be.

18:58.305 --> 18:59.672
How many sexual
encounters is acceptable?

18:59.706 --> 19:00.940
What would make
you happy?

19:00.973 --> 19:02.275
This is not about me.

19:02.309 --> 19:04.311
Oh, it is so
certainly about you.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.413
Let's drop...
How many sexual encounters
did you have in college?

19:06.446 --> 19:07.447
Come on.
Let's drop it, okay?

19:07.480 --> 19:08.515
No, how many?

19:08.548 --> 19:10.350
Are we including summers?

19:12.352 --> 19:13.720
(sighs)

19:15.822 --> 19:17.690
Laurel, we shouldn't
end it like this...

19:17.724 --> 19:19.726
Here.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.633
Doggie bag.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.303
Laurel...
No.

19:30.337 --> 19:31.671
When I feel more like it,
we'll talk.

19:31.704 --> 19:33.940
I come from a
conservative fam...

19:33.973 --> 19:35.442
Actually, I don't care. Bye.

19:35.475 --> 19:36.543
Go now.

19:39.712 --> 19:42.515
She had 24 confirmed
sexual liaisons

19:42.549 --> 19:44.651
in and after college.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.686
You'll find them
tabbed in yellow.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.721
(whistles)
Twenty-four.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.757
The Healys sure do get around.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.525
ASHLEY:
One paramour was

19:52.559 --> 19:54.861
a Russian
foreign exchange student

19:54.894 --> 19:56.363
named Kirill.

19:56.396 --> 19:57.864
He is a direct
descendent of Kruschev.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.999
Yeah, this doesn't really
help us, Ashley.

20:00.032 --> 20:03.636
You see, the key
to oppo research

20:03.670 --> 20:06.539
is to hit on
that one infraction.

20:06.573 --> 20:10.810
So, what is
our one thing?

20:11.944 --> 20:13.446
Laurel slept with her communist

20:13.480 --> 20:15.315
poly sci professor
and had an abortion.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.317
That's interesting.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.451
Unfortunately,

20:18.485 --> 20:19.852
it's not true.

20:19.886 --> 20:20.787
Wha...

20:20.820 --> 20:21.988
How do we know that?

20:22.021 --> 20:23.656
Because we do.

20:23.690 --> 20:24.924
She slept with

20:24.957 --> 20:26.459
her professor, Colin Handke,

20:26.493 --> 20:27.894
but there was
no pregnancy

20:27.927 --> 20:28.895
or abortion.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.998
Okay.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.300
Then, Ashley...

20:34.601 --> 20:36.035
...find out what
else we can use.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.604
Yes, Senator.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.540
Yeah, Gareth.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.708
Let's talk a minute.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.510
Yes, Senator.

20:46.979 --> 20:49.916
Yeah, my friends down at SRB-54

20:49.949 --> 20:51.884
said you tried
to get in the door?

20:51.918 --> 20:53.420
I did, yes.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.722
Why?
I'm your chief
of staff, Senator.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.557
I should be aware of all aspects
of your operation.

20:57.590 --> 21:01.894
Yes, but I'd rather you not
touch upon this aspect.

21:01.928 --> 21:02.995
Why?

21:03.029 --> 21:04.697
Because it's mine.

21:06.633 --> 21:07.800
Do we understand each other?

21:07.834 --> 21:08.935
Yes.

21:08.968 --> 21:10.803
Good.

21:12.805 --> 21:14.341
Hello, Laurel.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.008
Uh-oh.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.677
Do I need a lawyer?

21:17.710 --> 21:19.546
Everyone needs a lawyer.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.414
Do I need a lawyer now?

21:21.448 --> 21:22.949
Well...

21:22.982 --> 21:24.984
let's close your door
and find out.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.623
What's the issue here?

21:30.657 --> 21:32.692
The leak.
The leak to Claudia Monarch

21:32.725 --> 21:35.762
about a CIA briefing.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.831
Your brother apparently
told you about it.

21:38.865 --> 21:40.567
He said that?

21:40.600 --> 21:41.668
Yes.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.770
And now the question is:

21:43.803 --> 21:45.572
did you tell the press?

21:45.605 --> 21:47.674
What did Luke say?

21:47.707 --> 21:48.941
He thinks you told the press.

21:48.975 --> 21:51.844
You wanted to stop the war,
so you leaked.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.680
And what if I said I didn't?

21:53.713 --> 21:55.382
That would be good.

21:55.415 --> 21:56.749
Is it true?

21:58.551 --> 22:00.553
Yes.

22:02.121 --> 22:04.724
Claudia Monarch has been given
the full Judith Miller.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.393
She's in jail,
and I don't think

22:06.426 --> 22:08.127
she'll last that long.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.631
Will she mention your name
as the leaker?

22:12.765 --> 22:14.601
No.

22:14.634 --> 22:17.470
Okay. Then this is
my instruction to you:

22:17.504 --> 22:19.372
don't tell anyone
what we said here.

22:19.406 --> 22:20.740
Do you understand?

22:20.773 --> 22:22.809
I understand.

22:22.842 --> 22:25.378
Good. That's it.

22:28.047 --> 22:29.882
(door opens, closes)

22:29.916 --> 22:31.651
MAN:
What do you want?

22:31.684 --> 22:33.152
You handle I.T.
for the office?

22:33.185 --> 22:35.822
I handle I.T.
when they let me handle I.T.

22:35.855 --> 22:38.625
More often, they just
bitch and bitch and bitch.

22:38.658 --> 22:40.893
You handle I.T. for all
the senator offices?

22:40.927 --> 22:42.094
Yeah. Why?

22:42.128 --> 22:44.063
SRB-54, the
basement offices?

22:44.096 --> 22:46.032
All the senate offices. Why?

22:46.065 --> 22:49.168
I need the Wi-Fi
turned off in SRB-54.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.770
How would I do that?

22:50.803 --> 22:52.905
You wouldn't do that.
I'd do that.

22:52.939 --> 22:53.906
Oh.

22:53.940 --> 22:56.409
Okay. Could you do that?

22:56.443 --> 22:58.678
Why would I?

22:58.711 --> 23:02.482
Because I appreciate you
and no one else does.

23:04.517 --> 23:05.852
Why should I believe that?

23:05.885 --> 23:08.020
Because I just said so.

23:13.493 --> 23:14.694
Come on.

23:16.863 --> 23:17.930
(all muttering)

23:17.964 --> 23:19.899
Wi-Fi's down.

23:19.932 --> 23:21.568
(knock on door)

23:23.570 --> 23:26.105
Our Wi-Fi is down
downstairs.

23:26.138 --> 23:29.108
I'm sorry, what?

23:29.141 --> 23:32.078
Our Wi-Fi needs to be rebooted.
They said it's up here.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.515
Are you sure you want me?

23:35.548 --> 23:36.916
Shouldn't you be going to Red?

23:36.949 --> 23:38.585
Come on.
Okay.

23:38.618 --> 23:41.688
I need to reboot up here
and downstairs.

23:54.634 --> 23:55.835
Hey.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.169
Over here.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.915
(computer beeps)

24:13.586 --> 24:16.088
What do I need to do?

24:16.122 --> 24:18.625
Turn those all off and on.
Every one.

24:29.201 --> 24:30.770
(camera clicks)

24:30.803 --> 24:33.139
(chuckles):
So good to see you again.

24:33.172 --> 24:35.274
And you.
I think you've grown taller.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.777
No. No, it's just the
tailoring on my suits.

24:37.810 --> 24:38.811
(both chuckle)

24:40.046 --> 24:41.781
Well...

24:41.814 --> 24:43.750
is there something
more you want to ask

24:43.783 --> 24:46.018
of my client,
or shall we just drop

24:46.052 --> 24:47.654
this whole witch hunt?

24:47.687 --> 24:49.756
(chuckles)
Just... just one more question.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.157
And I'm glad
you got a lawyer,

24:51.190 --> 24:52.625
Senator.

24:52.659 --> 24:54.627
Oh. I hope
you don't mind.

24:54.661 --> 24:56.763
I've asked my client
to talk through me.

24:56.796 --> 24:58.765
Well, sure. Sure.

24:58.798 --> 25:01.634
And... and, uh... here.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.672
Uh, this was
sent to me

25:05.705 --> 25:07.540
by someone in your office.

25:07.574 --> 25:10.209
It appears, Senator,
that you called

25:10.242 --> 25:11.978
Claudia Monarch
five hours

25:12.011 --> 25:13.946
before she reported
on that leak.

25:13.980 --> 25:15.715
Now, do you want
to tell me why?

25:15.748 --> 25:16.783
No, thank you.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.019
We'll discuss it.

25:20.052 --> 25:21.954
Would you like me to leave?

25:21.988 --> 25:23.189
Yes, please.

25:23.222 --> 25:24.691
(chuckles)

25:26.192 --> 25:28.094
LAWRENCE: You know,
just so you know,

25:28.127 --> 25:31.931
Claudia doesn't like
being behind bars.

25:31.964 --> 25:35.935
So, if you don't tell me,
she will.

25:37.236 --> 25:38.705
(door opens)

25:42.709 --> 25:44.176
Did you happen
to call Claudia Monarch

25:44.210 --> 25:45.978
in the last two days?

25:57.089 --> 25:59.058
PLANETARIUM NARRATOR: We travel
back five billion years

25:59.091 --> 26:01.027
to observe a great star.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.362
Its magnificent light,
that has shined

26:03.395 --> 26:05.064
for over ten million years,

26:05.097 --> 26:08.134
is about to be
extinguished forever.

26:08.167 --> 26:10.002
What is it?
Thanks for meeting me.

26:10.036 --> 26:11.704
You said you had something.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.072
A blueprint from SRB-54.

26:14.741 --> 26:16.743
What is it?
I have no idea.

26:19.746 --> 26:20.780
How did you get in?

26:20.813 --> 26:22.214
Trickery.

26:24.183 --> 26:26.786
What is 38 days from today?

26:26.819 --> 26:28.655
What?

26:28.688 --> 26:31.190
There was a calendar in SRB-54--
it was counting down.

26:31.223 --> 26:32.759
It said 38 days.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.794
I have no idea what that means.

26:34.827 --> 26:36.763
That's... September 12th.

26:36.796 --> 26:40.166
I know. I can't
figure it out either.

26:40.199 --> 26:42.669
I have to go. Can you
e-mail me the blueprint?

26:42.702 --> 26:43.936
Yeah.

26:43.970 --> 26:45.938
Hey, Laurel.

26:45.972 --> 26:47.740
I'm sorry.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.041
For?

26:49.075 --> 26:50.677
Last night.
Saying those things.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.144
I was an idiot.

26:52.178 --> 26:55.682
Whatever our pasts were,
that's not our present.

26:55.715 --> 26:57.750
Okay.

26:57.784 --> 27:00.753
Let me make you
dinner this time?

27:00.787 --> 27:02.855
You didn't like my quesadillas?

27:03.856 --> 27:05.057
Tonight.

27:08.127 --> 27:11.163
Over time, the star has
built up tremendous pressure.

27:11.197 --> 27:14.300
Soon, heavy elements within
will shoot out

27:14.333 --> 27:16.135
in every direction
across the galaxy...

27:16.168 --> 27:18.237
(door opens)

27:18.270 --> 27:19.271
Well.

27:19.305 --> 27:20.206
Hello.

27:20.239 --> 27:22.174
I have one more thing
that just came up.

27:22.208 --> 27:23.710
Good. Let's hear it.

27:23.743 --> 27:24.844
It's on his sister, Laurel.

27:24.877 --> 27:26.779
Great. What, she kill someone?

27:26.813 --> 27:28.314
Not exactly.

27:28.347 --> 27:29.348
(chuckles)

27:35.421 --> 27:37.389
I don't believe it.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.158
It's true.
How do you know?

27:39.191 --> 27:40.192
I have three witnesses
at Sundance.

27:40.226 --> 27:41.728
It was after a screening.

27:41.761 --> 27:42.829
She had a documentary there.

27:43.462 --> 27:45.431
She slept with Michael Moore?

27:45.464 --> 27:47.366
Yes.

27:47.399 --> 27:49.468
I want to take it in to Red.
No.

27:49.501 --> 27:50.970
Not yet.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.438
When?

27:52.471 --> 27:54.406
Not yet.

28:03.816 --> 28:04.784
(exhales)

28:04.817 --> 28:07.053
(sniffles)

28:22.101 --> 28:24.904
(gags)

28:24.937 --> 28:26.272
(clears throat)

28:31.778 --> 28:33.145
KARA:
Okay.

28:33.179 --> 28:35.214
I think it's time
you two talked.

28:35.247 --> 28:36.949
Who leaked?

28:36.983 --> 28:38.985
I didn't.
I didn't either.

28:39.018 --> 28:40.319
LUKE:
Wait, you didn't?

28:40.352 --> 28:41.854
No, I thought you did.
I didn't.

28:41.888 --> 28:43.522
I thought you did.
Okay.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.224
Family misunderstanding.

28:45.257 --> 28:46.425
Second question.

28:46.458 --> 28:48.160
Who called Claudia Monarch?

28:48.194 --> 28:50.162
Come on,
one of you did.

28:50.196 --> 28:51.831
The call came from
these offices.

28:51.864 --> 28:52.832
I did.

28:52.865 --> 28:54.100
What?

28:54.133 --> 28:55.167
Why?

28:55.201 --> 28:57.837
I was going to leak
the information,

28:57.870 --> 28:59.305
but I decided not to.

28:59.338 --> 29:01.240
Okay.

29:01.273 --> 29:03.342
This puts us
in a sticky situation.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.244
Luke told you about

29:05.277 --> 29:08.147
the CIA briefing,
and that was illegal.

29:08.180 --> 29:09.281
And Lawrence Boch

29:09.315 --> 29:11.483
can compel you to testify,
Laurel,

29:11.517 --> 29:13.953
if he thinks you have
something to contribute.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.988
Does he think I have
something to contribute?

29:16.022 --> 29:17.389
I would've said no,

29:17.423 --> 29:21.260
but he keeps...
throwing your name out there.

29:21.293 --> 29:24.030
So... we need to
give him something.

29:25.197 --> 29:26.398
Such as?

29:26.432 --> 29:28.968
Well, he's a good man.

29:29.001 --> 29:30.502
And he wants the truth,

29:30.536 --> 29:32.238
n-not just a-a leak.

29:32.271 --> 29:34.440
And what's the truth?

29:37.209 --> 29:39.846
Mr. Boch.
My guess is you have
some information for me.

29:39.879 --> 29:40.880
I do.

29:40.913 --> 29:42.281
Did you leak
to Claudia Monarch?

29:42.314 --> 29:43.883
No.

29:43.916 --> 29:46.118
Did you tell your sister
about the CIA briefing?

29:46.152 --> 29:48.888
I read your report
on the Iraq War--

29:48.921 --> 29:51.023
the false WMD evidence.

29:51.057 --> 29:52.892
Very well-written.

29:52.925 --> 29:55.027
Thank you.
Now, did you know

29:55.061 --> 29:57.296
the same thing was
happening here?

29:58.931 --> 30:00.933
Senator Wheatus
has a private room--

30:00.967 --> 30:02.935
SRB-54--

30:02.969 --> 30:05.171
where he's creating
false evidence

30:05.204 --> 30:07.606
connecting Syria
to bioterrorism.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.808
That's not my mission, Senator.

30:11.911 --> 30:14.213
These are blueprints
taken from that room.

30:14.246 --> 30:16.282
Blueprints for?

30:16.315 --> 30:18.417
LUKE: Facilities.
Look at the bottom.

30:18.450 --> 30:21.120
Facilities in Colorado,
New Mexico, California...

30:22.221 --> 30:23.622
Manzanar.

30:23.655 --> 30:26.158
Internment camps?

30:26.192 --> 30:30.462
Yes. For Syrian refugees--
shovel-ready in 38 days.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.631
Eh, it'll never happen.
It'll happen.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.601
People are angry. Anything can
happen when people are angry.

30:35.634 --> 30:39.205
So you're suggesting I overlook
the leak because of this?

30:39.238 --> 30:42.942
No, I'm suggesting you widen
the scope of your investigation.

30:42.975 --> 30:44.476
You have two
million dollars.

30:44.510 --> 30:46.378
Why not go after
the real culprit?

30:53.986 --> 30:55.988
*

31:06.332 --> 31:09.135
Gareth.

31:09.168 --> 31:11.403
Hi.

31:11.437 --> 31:13.906
Wow, you look like
something's wrong.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.541
No, no. I, um...

31:15.574 --> 31:17.476
I forgot dinner.

31:17.509 --> 31:19.478
I was gonna make you dinner.

31:22.281 --> 31:24.116
(chuckles)

31:24.150 --> 31:26.252
You want to know a funny thing?

31:26.285 --> 31:28.120
Sure, but I'm not
sure it sounds funny.

31:28.154 --> 31:30.322
What do you mean?
Just the way your
voice sounds--

31:30.356 --> 31:32.024
it doesn't sound
like a funny thing.

31:32.058 --> 31:34.126
No, it's funny.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.494
The newest oppo research

31:35.527 --> 31:37.563
has you sleeping with
someone I know is wrong.

31:37.596 --> 31:38.564
Really?

31:38.597 --> 31:40.399
Yeah. You want to know who?

31:41.667 --> 31:43.435
Sure, if you want to tell me.

31:45.104 --> 31:46.438
Michael Moore.

31:48.074 --> 31:50.609
You know, Michael Moore,
the liberal.

31:50.642 --> 31:52.979
I do.

31:53.012 --> 31:55.314
I told the researcher
that that couldn't be true.

31:55.347 --> 31:58.484
I mean, you and Michael Moore.

31:58.517 --> 32:00.419
Good.

32:00.452 --> 32:02.254
(chuckles)

32:02.288 --> 32:03.455
It's not true, right?

32:03.489 --> 32:06.292
Why don't we get dinner.

32:06.325 --> 32:07.426
Laurel.

32:10.462 --> 32:13.265
There are certain names,
to a Republican.

32:13.299 --> 32:15.267
I mean, what would
the equivalent be?

32:15.301 --> 32:18.404
If I slept with
Ann Coulter, I guess.

32:18.437 --> 32:19.972
Have you slept
with Ann Coulter?

32:20.006 --> 32:21.240
No.
Good.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.042
Then let's get dinner.

32:24.710 --> 32:26.979
Did you sleep with
Michael Moore?

32:27.013 --> 32:29.281
Do you really
want to know?

32:29.315 --> 32:31.050
I don't know. Yes.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.318
Yes.

32:32.351 --> 32:35.021
At Sundance.
Just once.

32:35.054 --> 32:37.056
Okay. Let's get dinner.

32:37.089 --> 32:39.291
Ready?

32:42.094 --> 32:43.395
Now, what are these?

32:43.429 --> 32:46.165
Blueprints taken from
one of your offices.

32:46.198 --> 32:48.000
Are you sure?

32:48.034 --> 32:49.335
I've never seen them before.

32:49.368 --> 32:52.138
Why are you pushing
for the war in Syria?

32:52.171 --> 32:54.140
Because they're attacking
my country.

32:54.173 --> 32:57.476
Maybe you're not aware,
but two of my staff members

32:57.509 --> 32:59.745
were personally killed
by Syrian agents.

32:59.778 --> 33:02.414
You know that for a fact?
You know that not for a fact?

33:02.448 --> 33:05.784
No, but the burden of proof
rests with you proving it.

33:05.817 --> 33:08.220
Ugh, what's going on, Lawrence?

33:08.254 --> 33:09.521
Has Luke gotten to you?

33:09.555 --> 33:11.390
Luke and his
sophist ways?

33:11.423 --> 33:13.625
I am expanding my investigation.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.761
Good.
You need to stop these leaks.

33:15.794 --> 33:17.363
No, I'm expanding
this investigation

33:17.396 --> 33:19.031
into the cause for this war.

33:19.065 --> 33:21.033
God. You liberals.

33:21.067 --> 33:22.668
You're destroying
this country.

33:22.701 --> 33:24.803
I'm not a liberal.
Then what are you?

33:24.836 --> 33:27.106
A thinking independent.
Then think about this.

33:27.139 --> 33:30.542
This country is being
taken over from within.

33:30.576 --> 33:33.045
It's like the redcoats!

33:33.079 --> 33:34.780
They want us to bow
to their socialist king.

33:34.813 --> 33:36.782
Come on, Red.
Stop with the propaganda.

33:36.815 --> 33:38.117
This isn't propaganda!

33:38.150 --> 33:39.285
When you scream "war" every time

33:39.318 --> 33:40.652
there's a political
disagreement,

33:40.686 --> 33:42.588
the people stop believing you
when there is a war.

33:42.621 --> 33:44.690
There's no going back
from that kind of language.

33:44.723 --> 33:46.125
Well, there is a war.

33:46.158 --> 33:47.559
Yes, with the Syrians.

33:47.593 --> 33:50.696
But also with people
right here, right next door,

33:50.729 --> 33:53.399
right down the hall,
right in this office.

33:53.432 --> 33:55.267
Really?

33:55.301 --> 33:58.270
Well, if this is a war,
and I am your enemy,

33:58.304 --> 34:01.073
then why not take out a gun
and shoot me right now?

34:01.107 --> 34:02.708
(laughs)
That's what
the words mean.

34:02.741 --> 34:04.610
You can't just...
(splattering)

34:11.650 --> 34:13.051
(gunshot)

34:18.524 --> 34:20.559
Oh, my God.

34:20.592 --> 34:22.194
Why'd he do it?

34:22.228 --> 34:23.695
He just took
out the gun.

34:23.729 --> 34:25.831
I told him, "Stop!"

34:25.864 --> 34:27.233
What's your name again?

34:27.266 --> 34:29.101
Jed.

34:29.135 --> 34:30.369
Right, Jed the intern.

34:30.402 --> 34:31.437
Where are you going?

34:31.470 --> 34:33.605
To call the police.

34:33.639 --> 34:35.541
No, no, no, no.

34:35.574 --> 34:38.877
Listen, uh... go grab the dolly
from the bullpen closet.

34:38.910 --> 34:40.612
Huh? You'll find
a drop cloth

34:40.646 --> 34:42.314
up on the top shelf.

34:42.348 --> 34:43.649
What?

34:43.682 --> 34:44.850
Jed.
(snaps fingers)

34:44.883 --> 34:46.785
Listen to me.

34:46.818 --> 34:48.320
I need your help.

34:48.354 --> 34:49.688
Go grab the dolly

34:49.721 --> 34:51.690
and the drop cloth
from the closet.

34:51.723 --> 34:53.525
Go!

35:02.234 --> 35:04.436
Why'd you make me do that,
Lawrence?

35:05.737 --> 35:06.738
(groans)

35:18.817 --> 35:20.252
Dare I?

35:34.533 --> 35:37.536
One of the best minds
of our generation.

35:42.441 --> 35:44.410
Oh, that's not bad.

35:58.790 --> 36:00.659
Hey, good job!

36:00.692 --> 36:02.694
Let's get to work.
What are we doing?

36:02.728 --> 36:06.432
Laying a great man to rest.

36:06.465 --> 36:07.966
*

36:07.999 --> 36:11.603
* So long

36:11.637 --> 36:13.305
* The days while...

36:13.339 --> 36:15.841
Okay, just so I understand.
Were you drinking?

36:15.874 --> 36:17.876
Okay, that's enough.
No. Just make me
understand.

36:17.909 --> 36:19.411
How old were you?

36:19.445 --> 36:20.546
Twenty-five.

36:20.579 --> 36:22.748
And you were drinking.

36:22.781 --> 36:24.316
No, I was completely sober.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.620
Have you seen Fahrenheit 9/11?

36:28.654 --> 36:30.222
Okay, I think
you should go home.

36:30.256 --> 36:33.292
I'm not... I'm not
trying to judge you.

36:33.325 --> 36:35.361
* So wrong

36:35.394 --> 36:39.431
* You know it always feels...

36:39.465 --> 36:41.933
Good night, Gareth.

36:41.967 --> 36:44.470
* To say good-bye to you...

36:44.503 --> 36:46.772
Sorry. I'll call you.

36:46.805 --> 36:49.475
No. Don't.

36:49.508 --> 36:52.311
You handled this poorly.

36:52.344 --> 36:54.413
* So long

36:54.446 --> 36:55.914
* So long *

36:57.416 --> 36:58.917
* So long *

36:58.950 --> 36:59.918
* So long

36:59.951 --> 37:00.986
* So long *

37:01.019 --> 37:03.455
* So...

37:03.489 --> 37:05.023
* So long *

37:05.056 --> 37:09.861
* So... long

37:09.895 --> 37:12.331
* So long

37:12.364 --> 37:15.634
* So long...

37:19.371 --> 37:20.572
You have some...

37:20.606 --> 37:22.508
Oh. Oh, thank
you, sweetie.

37:24.376 --> 37:25.744
Senators, I'm not sure

37:25.777 --> 37:27.746
what we can do
if Lawrence Boch

37:27.779 --> 37:29.481
isn't here
to present his report.

37:29.515 --> 37:32.451
I think we should look for
another special prosecutor.

37:32.484 --> 37:34.753
Excuse me. He's been
missing one day.

37:34.786 --> 37:37.556
Yes, but Lawrence Boch
came to me last night

37:37.589 --> 37:38.890
and told me he was worried

37:38.924 --> 37:40.992
and scared.
He had received

37:41.026 --> 37:43.629
threatening calls
from Syrian terrorists.

37:43.662 --> 37:45.997
Are you serious?
Yes, Senator, I am serious.

37:46.031 --> 37:47.866
I take Syrian terrorism
very seriously,

37:47.899 --> 37:50.436
as did Mr. Boch.

37:50.469 --> 37:54.473
And still does, I imagine.

37:54.506 --> 37:57.008
He was worried he was being
hunted due to his work

37:57.042 --> 37:58.577
on this committee.

37:58.610 --> 38:01.980
Again, I would argue for
a new special prosecutor--

38:02.013 --> 38:04.015
perhaps a conservative
this time.

38:04.049 --> 38:05.517
LUKE:
I would disagree.

38:05.551 --> 38:08.086
Let's give Mr. Boch some
time before we move on.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.422
Come on, we need
to find this leaker.

38:10.456 --> 38:13.925
All those in favor
of staying the course,

38:13.959 --> 38:15.894
please signify
by raising your hands.

38:19.698 --> 38:21.333
Come on!

38:21.367 --> 38:22.568
I want oppo research.

38:22.601 --> 38:24.336
This is child's play.

38:24.370 --> 38:26.071
I've got a half-dozen affairs
with married women.

38:26.104 --> 38:27.739
That's hardly child's play.

38:27.773 --> 38:30.542
It's old news.
Everyone knows that about Luke.

38:30.576 --> 38:32.578
What about the sister, Lana?

38:32.611 --> 38:34.980
Laurel. Nothing yet.
Ugh.

38:35.013 --> 38:36.848
I had a lead that she
slept with Michael Moore...

38:36.882 --> 38:38.417
(shudders)

38:38.450 --> 38:39.618
...but it turned out
not to be true.

38:41.453 --> 38:43.555
What? It... it did?

38:43.589 --> 38:44.723
As of when?

38:44.756 --> 38:46.825
This morning. It was gossip.

38:46.858 --> 38:50.095
The three witnesses confused
Laurel with another filmmaker.

38:50.128 --> 38:51.697
You're sure?

38:51.730 --> 38:52.698
Gareth, please,

38:52.731 --> 38:54.633
can we get back
to work here?

38:54.666 --> 38:56.502
ASHLEY:
Yes, I am sure.

38:56.535 --> 38:59.571
Michael Moore left Sundance
before Laurel even arrived.

38:59.605 --> 39:00.772
Hey,

39:00.806 --> 39:02.474
let's get some painters in here.

39:02.508 --> 39:05.777
That's such an ugly spot
on the wall.

39:11.783 --> 39:13.852
There she is!

39:13.885 --> 39:16.588
Thank you, thank you all.
Thank you so much.

39:16.622 --> 39:18.924
The First Amendment
is the real winner here today.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.430
Shall we get back
to the good fight?

39:29.067 --> 39:31.136
I heard you

39:31.169 --> 39:32.904
were ready to cut a deal.

39:32.938 --> 39:35.541
No. Where'd you hear that?

39:35.574 --> 39:37.676
From the special prosecutor.

39:37.709 --> 39:39.177
Before he went missing.

39:39.210 --> 39:42.180
Well, it's true,
I'm not a big fan of jail.

39:42.213 --> 39:44.015
Neither am I.

39:44.049 --> 39:47.052
So... don't say anything.

39:47.085 --> 39:48.720
About you leaking?

39:48.754 --> 39:51.089
Don't worry.

39:51.122 --> 39:53.391
As long as I stay
on the outside.

39:59.965 --> 40:01.800
They're internment camps.

40:01.833 --> 40:04.102
You're planning on taking
Syrian refugees into custody.

40:04.135 --> 40:06.638
No, no, no, no, no,
they're just buildings.

40:06.672 --> 40:08.540
Beautifying the landscape.

40:08.574 --> 40:09.741
Part of the farm bill.

40:09.775 --> 40:11.477
Oh, okay, good.

40:11.510 --> 40:13.445
Then I'll send it
to The New York Times.

40:13.479 --> 40:15.447
Let's see how
that goes over.

40:19.718 --> 40:21.453
Tomorrow, when we convene,

40:21.487 --> 40:23.221
you tell the committee
you've had a change of heart

40:23.254 --> 40:24.623
about all this war talk.

40:24.656 --> 40:25.824
You were wrong.

40:25.857 --> 40:27.926
Why would I do that?

40:27.959 --> 40:31.830
So I won't send your internment
proposal to the press.

40:31.863 --> 40:33.532
(slurps)

40:33.565 --> 40:34.933
(laughs)

40:34.966 --> 40:36.935
(chuckles) I'll do it.

40:36.968 --> 40:38.637
Oh... oh, please.

40:38.670 --> 40:40.005
I'll help you.

40:40.038 --> 40:43.942
God, I love the sweetness
of the liberal.

40:43.975 --> 40:46.745
The New York Times. Yeah.

40:46.778 --> 40:48.179
Yeah, once they print it,

40:48.213 --> 40:50.649
people will come
to their senses.

40:50.682 --> 40:54.786
"Oh, my God, internment camps."

40:54.820 --> 40:57.489
Don't you realize?
I'll be a hero.

40:57.523 --> 41:00.191
People want
internment camps.

41:00.225 --> 41:02.127
They want the Syrians
held captive.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.062
We did it with the Japanese.

41:04.095 --> 41:05.597
That turned out well.

41:05.631 --> 41:07.132
Didn't hurt
FDR's reputation.

41:07.165 --> 41:10.502
(scoffs) Think it'll hurt mine?

41:10.536 --> 41:12.103
(slurping)

41:22.247 --> 41:23.682
Hi.

41:26.718 --> 41:27.853
I saw this,

41:27.886 --> 41:30.088
and it made me
think of you.

41:33.725 --> 41:34.993
I'm sorry.

41:35.026 --> 41:36.962
You never slept
with Michael Moore.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.730
And I was an idiot.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.069
Gareth, um...

41:44.102 --> 41:46.004
Uh-oh.

41:48.106 --> 41:50.108
I just think
we're too different.

41:50.141 --> 41:52.077
Our politics, our jobs.

41:52.110 --> 41:54.613
And yet we seem
to make it work.

41:55.847 --> 41:57.849
Sometimes. (chuckles)

42:00.786 --> 42:02.988
I think we should take a break.

42:05.924 --> 42:07.926
Yeah.

42:07.959 --> 42:09.961
Yeah, that's fine.

42:13.932 --> 42:15.266
(sets DVD on desk)

42:19.170 --> 42:20.572
Okay.

42:29.247 --> 42:30.649
Good-bye.

42:32.884 --> 42:34.886
Good-bye.
