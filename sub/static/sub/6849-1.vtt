00:55.054 --> 00:57.113
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

00:59.425 --> 01:00.824
Hey! Hey, guys!

01:19.412 --> 01:20.743
Faster!

01:22.115 --> 01:23.707
Hey, what you got under there?

01:23.817 --> 01:25.546
- Hey, you want to race?
- Oh, please.

01:25.652 --> 01:27.677
- Come on!
- Come on, let's go!

01:35.396 --> 01:36.863
Come on!

01:39.667 --> 01:42.864
- Please?
- Come on! Let's go! Come on!

01:59.454 --> 02:00.944
Come on. Let's go.

02:03.525 --> 02:05.494
Go faster! Faster!

02:53.945 --> 02:55.037
Sorry, gentlemen.

02:55.146 --> 02:57.980
This whole area is closed for
weapons testing for the next 24 hours.

02:58.083 --> 03:01.052
That includes all on-base personnel.

03:01.153 --> 03:02.916
Good afternoon, sir.

03:10.129 --> 03:11.721
I'm afraid that goes for you, too,
Colonel, sir.

03:11.830 --> 03:13.127
The Pentagon sent out revised...

04:37.321 --> 04:38.618
Russians.

04:40.457 --> 04:42.755
This ain't gonna be easy.

04:42.860 --> 04:44.624
Not as easy as it used to be.

04:44.729 --> 04:47.493
- Well, we've been through worse.
- Yeah? When?

04:47.599 --> 04:49.499
Flensburg. There was twice as many.

04:49.601 --> 04:51.899
- We were younger.
- I still am young!

04:52.003 --> 04:53.231
We had guns.

04:53.338 --> 04:57.138
Put your hands down, will you?
You're embarrassing us.

04:57.242 --> 04:59.802
Bet you 500 bucks
we can get out of this.

05:09.889 --> 05:11.550
Let's call it 100.

05:15.328 --> 05:17.455
You recognize building, yes?

05:24.338 --> 05:25.669
Drop dead.

05:31.178 --> 05:33.112
I'm sorry.

05:33.213 --> 05:35.512
I meant drop dead, comrade.

05:53.102 --> 05:56.003
- Where was he found?
- In Mexico.

05:56.105 --> 05:59.632
They were digging in the dirt,
looking for this stuff.

06:04.713 --> 06:07.113
You're not from around here, are you?

06:07.216 --> 06:11.779
Where is it you would imagine
I am from, Dr. Jones?

06:12.822 --> 06:14.949
Well, the way you're sinking your teeth
into those wubble-u's,

06:15.058 --> 06:18.459
I should think maybe Eastern Ukraine.

06:18.561 --> 06:20.495
Highest marks.

06:20.597 --> 06:22.588
Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko.

06:24.567 --> 06:27.934
Three times
I have received Order of Lenin.

06:28.037 --> 06:32.031
Also medal as Hero of Socialist Labor.

06:32.143 --> 06:33.440
And why?

06:34.745 --> 06:39.705
Because I know things.
I know them before anyone else.

06:39.817 --> 06:43.014
And what I do not know, I find out.

06:43.921 --> 06:48.791
Now, what I need to know now
is in here.

07:04.110 --> 07:08.604
- You are a hard man to read, Dr. Jones.
- Ouch.

07:08.748 --> 07:13.515
So, we will do this,
what is expression, old-fashioned way.

07:13.619 --> 07:17.077
You will tell us.
You will help us find what we seek.

07:39.314 --> 07:41.748
This warehouse
is where you and your government

07:41.850 --> 07:44.546
have hidden all of your secrets, yes?

07:44.652 --> 07:48.918
This is a military warehouse.
I've never been here before in my life.

07:50.558 --> 07:52.753
Object we seek,
rectangular storage container,

07:52.861 --> 07:56.559
dimensions 2 meters by 0.5 meter
by 66 centimeters.

07:56.665 --> 07:59.725
Contents of box, mummified remains.

07:59.835 --> 08:02.235
This is no doubt familiar to you.

08:02.338 --> 08:05.739
What makes you think I've got any idea
what box you're talking about?

08:05.841 --> 08:07.900
Because 10 years ago

08:08.010 --> 08:11.002
you were part of the team
that examined it.

08:14.050 --> 08:15.540
Look...

08:15.652 --> 08:19.179
Even if I
knew what you were talking about...

08:19.289 --> 08:22.747
You will help us find it.

08:34.038 --> 08:36.563
Compass. I need a compass.

08:36.674 --> 08:38.369
You know, north, south, east...

08:38.476 --> 08:39.773
West.

08:41.379 --> 08:43.006
No compass?

08:44.949 --> 08:46.814
I need your bullets.

08:54.359 --> 08:57.795
The contents of that box
are highly magnetized.

08:57.896 --> 08:58.988
I need gunpowder.

08:59.097 --> 09:01.998
You want my help or not?

09:14.914 --> 09:19.078
Don't toy with me, Dr. Jones.
What is the point of all this?

09:19.185 --> 09:21.050
If it's still magnetic,

09:21.154 --> 09:24.352
the metal in this gunpowder
should point the way.

09:54.756 --> 09:57.623
Shells. Give me some shotgun shells.

10:00.963 --> 10:02.123
Pliers.

13:20.273 --> 13:24.073
Drop the guns,
or Colonel Dr. Spalko is dead.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.728
Why, Mac?

13:46.835 --> 13:49.201
Well, what can I say, Jonesey?

13:49.304 --> 13:52.603
I'm a capitalist, and they pay.

13:54.476 --> 13:57.673
After all those years
we spent spying on the Reds?

13:59.815 --> 14:02.147
I thought we were friends, Mac.

14:02.251 --> 14:05.380
I've had a run of bad luck
with the cards lately, mate.

14:05.488 --> 14:07.979
Awful. Bloody awful.

14:09.659 --> 14:12.287
I can't go home empty-handed again.

14:13.029 --> 14:16.157
No defiant last words, Dr. Jones?

14:18.668 --> 14:20.829
I like Ike.

14:20.937 --> 14:22.405
Put down gun.

14:23.274 --> 14:24.901
You got it, pal.

14:51.870 --> 14:54.236
Damn, I thought that was closer.

14:58.477 --> 14:59.603
Come on. Come on.

15:18.165 --> 15:20.156
He's not to get out of here alive!
Block the exits!

15:26.239 --> 15:28.366
Don't get clever, Boris.
You don't know him.

15:28.475 --> 15:29.499
Know him. Know him.

15:29.609 --> 15:31.703
You don't know him!
You don't know him!

15:31.813 --> 15:34.873
You don't know him! You don't know...

17:14.921 --> 17:16.387
You did well.

18:56.361 --> 18:58.921
Hello? Hello?

19:04.804 --> 19:05.998
Hello!

19:07.407 --> 19:09.500
Hey. I knocked. You guys got a...

19:16.916 --> 19:18.349
Wait a minute.

19:18.451 --> 19:20.147
<i>Come on, gang!</i>

19:33.267 --> 19:35.235
Oh, that can't be good.

19:37.672 --> 19:41.005
<i>All personnel,</i>
<i>it is now one minute to zero time.</i>

19:41.309 --> 19:43.834
<i>Put on goggles or turn away.</i>

19:43.945 --> 19:49.178
<i>Do not remove goggles or face burst</i>
<i>until 10 seconds after first light.</i>

19:49.284 --> 19:50.751
That can't be good at all.

19:58.527 --> 20:02.293
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

20:05.234 --> 20:07.566
Sure! Great! Don't wait for me!

20:07.670 --> 20:09.228
<i>Minus 15 seconds.</i>

20:17.247 --> 20:19.715
<i>Minus 10 seconds.</i>

20:20.017 --> 20:26.047
<i>Niner, eight, seven, six,</i>

20:26.156 --> 20:28.920
<i>fiver, four,</i>

20:29.026 --> 20:34.294
<i>three, two, one, zero.</i>

22:05.328 --> 22:08.354
<i>I had no reason to believe</i>
<i>that Mac was a spy.</i>

22:08.464 --> 22:10.762
He was Ml6 when I was in OSS.

22:10.867 --> 22:13.734
We did 20, 30 missions together
in Europe and the Pacific.

22:13.836 --> 22:16.237
Don't wave your war record
in our face, Colonel Jones.

22:16.340 --> 22:18.240
We all served.

22:18.342 --> 22:20.674
No kidding? What side were you on?

22:20.778 --> 22:23.542
I don't think you recognize
the gravity of your situation.

22:23.647 --> 22:26.115
You aided and abetted KGB agents

22:26.216 --> 22:29.379
who broke into
a top-secret military installation

22:29.486 --> 22:32.251
in the middle of the
United States of America, my country.

22:32.357 --> 22:35.292
What was in the steel box they took?

22:35.393 --> 22:38.089
You tell us. You've seen it before.

22:42.567 --> 22:45.229
You mean that Air Force fiasco in '47.

22:47.405 --> 22:49.601
I was tossed into a bus
with blacked-out windows

22:49.708 --> 22:52.609
and 20 people
I wasn't allowed to speak to.

22:52.711 --> 22:54.770
Hauled out in the middle of the night
in the middle of nowhere

22:54.880 --> 22:57.405
on some urgent recovery project
and shown what?

22:57.516 --> 22:58.540
Pieces of wreckage

22:58.651 --> 23:03.315
and an intensely magnetic shroud
covering mutilated remains?

23:03.422 --> 23:06.323
None of us
was ever given the full picture.

23:06.425 --> 23:09.054
And we were threatened with treason
if we ever talked about it.

23:09.162 --> 23:10.993
So, you tell me, what was in the box?

23:11.097 --> 23:12.428
Indy, thank God.

23:12.532 --> 23:14.762
Don't you know it's dangerous
to climb into a refrigerator?

23:14.868 --> 23:16.563
Those things can be deathtraps!

23:16.670 --> 23:19.104
Good to see you, too, Bob.

23:19.206 --> 23:21.572
Relax, boys. I can vouch for Dr. Jones.

23:21.675 --> 23:23.540
What the hell is going on?

23:23.643 --> 23:26.340
KGB on American soil?
Who is that woman?

23:26.447 --> 23:28.210
Describe her.

23:28.316 --> 23:29.943
Tall, thin, mid-30s,

23:30.051 --> 23:32.713
carried a sword of some kind,
a rapier, I think.

23:36.357 --> 23:38.188
Yeah, that's her.

23:38.292 --> 23:39.850
You sure she's here?

23:39.961 --> 23:42.328
Here and gone. Who is she?

23:42.431 --> 23:45.992
Irina Spalko,
she was Stalin's fair-haired girl.

23:46.101 --> 23:49.969
His favorite scientist, if you can call
psychic research science.

23:50.072 --> 23:51.130
General Ross...

23:51.240 --> 23:53.435
She's leading teams from the Kremlin
all over the world.

23:53.542 --> 23:54.668
Scooping up artifacts

23:54.776 --> 23:57.438
she thinks might have
paranormal military applications.

23:57.546 --> 24:00.516
- General Ross!
- Back off, Paul.

24:00.617 --> 24:04.109
Not everyone in the Army's a Commie
and certainly not Indy.

24:04.220 --> 24:08.623
What exactly am I being accused of,
besides surviving a nuclear blast?

24:08.725 --> 24:09.817
Nothing yet.

24:09.926 --> 24:11.826
But frankly your association
with George McHale

24:11.928 --> 24:16.160
makes all your activities suspicious,
including those during the war.

24:16.266 --> 24:18.167
Are you nuts?

24:18.269 --> 24:21.500
Do you have any idea how many medals
this son of a bitch won?

24:21.605 --> 24:23.573
A great many, I'm sure.

24:24.742 --> 24:27.336
But does he deserve them?

24:27.444 --> 24:31.403
Dr. Jones, let's just say for now
that you are of interest to the Bureau.

24:31.515 --> 24:33.642
Of great interest.

24:42.561 --> 24:45.291
Grooved Ware in the beginning
of modern drainage practices,

24:45.397 --> 24:48.855
which we also see in Skara Brae
on the west coast of Scotland.

24:48.967 --> 24:51.561
Skara Brae dates from 3100 B.C.

24:51.670 --> 24:54.367
and was continuously occupied
for 600 years

24:54.473 --> 24:57.306
until it was apparently
abandoned in 2500 B.C.

24:57.410 --> 24:59.537
There's no clear evidence
as to why its occupants

24:59.645 --> 25:04.446
decided to abandon
a perfectly healthy environment. Yes?

25:04.550 --> 25:07.917
- May I have a moment, Professor?
- Yes.

25:08.621 --> 25:10.487
Open up Michaelson. Review Chapter 4.

25:10.591 --> 25:11.683
When I come back we'll discuss

25:11.792 --> 25:14.727
the difference between
migration and exodus.

25:20.901 --> 25:22.129
What?

25:22.869 --> 25:25.633
You have no idea the pressure
coming from the Board of Regents.

25:25.739 --> 25:27.036
The FBI showed up this morning,

25:27.140 --> 25:29.701
ransacked your office,
searched all your files!

25:29.811 --> 25:31.642
You're the dean of the college.
Why didn't you stop them?

25:31.746 --> 25:32.974
They have no right.

25:33.081 --> 25:35.481
They had every right!
They weren't vandals.

25:35.583 --> 25:37.983
They were federal agents
with search warrants!

25:38.086 --> 25:41.522
The university isn't gonna get itself
embroiled in that kind of controversy,

25:41.623 --> 25:43.716
not in this charged climate.

25:44.793 --> 25:47.193
So you're firing me.

25:47.296 --> 25:51.562
A leave of absence is all.
An indefinite leave of absence.

25:51.667 --> 25:53.191
- You are firing me.
- During which

25:53.302 --> 25:56.135
they've agreed to continue to pay
your full salary for a period...

25:56.238 --> 25:57.671
I don't want their money!

25:57.773 --> 26:00.264
Please don't be foolish.

26:00.376 --> 26:02.241
You don't know what I had to go through
to get that for you.

26:02.345 --> 26:05.610
You went through? What exactly
did you have to go through, Charlie?

26:05.715 --> 26:07.046
Henry...

26:09.185 --> 26:11.050
I resigned.

26:18.795 --> 26:20.423
Where will you go?

26:21.932 --> 26:25.561
Train to New York,
overnight to London, for starts.

26:26.704 --> 26:31.004
I might end up teaching in Leipzig.
Heinrich owes me a favor.

26:31.108 --> 26:32.473
I'll wire you when I get settled.

26:32.576 --> 26:34.237
You can send on the rest of my things.

26:34.378 --> 26:36.505
I suppose
there's nothing to keep you here.

26:36.614 --> 26:38.549
I barely recognize this country anymore.

26:38.650 --> 26:41.710
The government's got us
seeing Communists in our soup.

26:41.820 --> 26:46.348
When the hysteria reaches academia,
I guess it's time to call it a career.

26:46.458 --> 26:48.483
How did Deirdre take the news?

26:48.593 --> 26:50.857
How does any wife take such things?

26:50.962 --> 26:54.090
The look on her face
was a combination of pride and panic.

26:54.199 --> 26:57.169
I never should've doubted you,
my friend.

26:57.270 --> 27:00.967
No, you have reason to question
your friends these days.

27:05.611 --> 27:08.011
Brutal couple of years, huh, Charlie?

27:10.016 --> 27:12.679
First Dad, then Marcus.

27:13.787 --> 27:16.153
We seem to have reached the age
where life stops giving us things

27:16.256 --> 27:18.417
and starts taking them away.

27:21.595 --> 27:23.756
Just another half glass.

28:21.958 --> 28:23.153
Hey!

28:24.996 --> 28:26.463
Hey, old man!

28:27.665 --> 28:31.692
Professor, hello! Hey!
Are you Dr. Jones?

28:31.803 --> 28:33.566
You're running out of platform, kid.

28:33.671 --> 28:35.866
Are you a friend of Dr. Oxley's?

28:35.973 --> 28:38.339
- Harold Oxley? The archeologist?
- Yeah.

28:38.442 --> 28:39.932
What about him?

28:41.013 --> 28:42.105
They're going to kill him.

28:44.917 --> 28:47.886
I haven't talked to Harold Oxley
in 20 years.

28:49.288 --> 28:51.518
He's a brilliant guy.

28:51.623 --> 28:54.490
He could put you to sleep
just by talking.

28:54.593 --> 28:57.654
Yeah. Yeah. When I was a kid,
that's how I did get to sleep.

28:57.764 --> 29:01.666
Oxley's voice was better than
a glass of warm milk, you know.

29:01.768 --> 29:03.702
The name's Mutt, Mutt Williams.

29:03.803 --> 29:06.966
- Mutt? What kind of name is that?
- Yeah.

29:07.073 --> 29:09.064
It's the one I picked.
You got a problem with it?

29:09.175 --> 29:13.441
Take it easy.
What was your relationship to Oxley?

29:13.546 --> 29:18.041
My dad died in the war.
Ox kind of helped my mom raise me.

29:18.152 --> 29:21.087
You were saying
somebody's going to kill him?

29:23.791 --> 29:27.090
Six months ago,
my mom gets a letter from the Ox.

29:27.194 --> 29:28.627
He's down in Peru.

29:28.729 --> 29:31.425
Found some type of skull,
a crystal skull.

29:31.532 --> 29:35.162
Like the one that guy
Mitchell-Hodgkiss? Hedgkiss?

29:35.270 --> 29:37.534
- The one he found.
- Nice jacket.

29:38.607 --> 29:42.976
The Ox and I were obsessed with
the Mitchell-Hedges skull in college.

29:43.078 --> 29:44.238
How do you know about it?

29:44.346 --> 29:45.608
Are you kidding? It's all he talked about.

29:45.714 --> 29:47.511
He'd talk about that thing
till the cows come home.

29:47.616 --> 29:49.516
What's it? It's like an idol?

29:49.618 --> 29:52.383
Deity carving. Mesoamerican.

29:52.488 --> 29:54.581
There are a number of crystal skulls
in the world.

29:54.690 --> 29:57.420
I saw one in the British Museum.

29:57.793 --> 30:01.388
Interesting craftsmanship,
but that's about it.

30:01.497 --> 30:04.295
All right, well, laugh if you want.
Oxley said he found it this time.

30:04.400 --> 30:08.360
He said this was real and he was off
to a place called Akator with it.

30:08.472 --> 30:11.168
- Akator? He said that? You're sure?
- Yeah.

30:11.275 --> 30:14.938
That's what he said.
He said Akator. What is it?

30:15.045 --> 30:18.640
It's a mythical lost city in the Amazon.

30:18.749 --> 30:21.718
Conquistadors called it El Dorado.

30:21.818 --> 30:25.846
Supposedly, the Ugha tribe were
chosen by the gods 7,000 years ago

30:25.957 --> 30:29.723
to build a giant city out of solid gold.

30:29.827 --> 30:32.387
It had aqueducts and paved roads

30:32.497 --> 30:37.560
and technology that
wouldn't be seen again for 5,000 years.

30:37.669 --> 30:42.629
Francisco de Orellana disappeared
into the Amazon looking for it in 1546.

30:43.642 --> 30:46.611
I almost died of typhus
looking for it myself.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.511
I don't think it exists.

30:49.615 --> 30:52.482
Why would Ox
want to take the skull there?

30:52.584 --> 30:56.384
The legend says that a crystal skull
was stolen from Akator

30:56.488 --> 30:58.422
in the 15th or 16th century,

30:58.524 --> 31:02.120
and that whoever returns the skull
to the city temple

31:02.228 --> 31:04.389
will be given control over its power.

31:04.497 --> 31:08.331
Power. Right. So there's some
kind of power. What's the power?

31:08.435 --> 31:11.495
I don't know, kid. It's just a story.

31:11.604 --> 31:12.730
No.

31:13.640 --> 31:15.767
From his letter, my mom thought
the Ox was off his rocker.

31:15.875 --> 31:16.864
You know, smog in the noggin,

31:16.977 --> 31:20.243
so she goes down there to find him,
only he'd already been kidnapped.

31:20.348 --> 31:22.111
Now they've got her, too.

31:22.216 --> 31:23.649
Now, Ox said
he hid that skull someplace,

31:23.751 --> 31:26.982
and if my mom doesn't come up with it,
they're gonna kill them both.

31:27.088 --> 31:29.181
Now, she said you'd help me.

31:29.957 --> 31:32.084
Me? What's your mom's name again?

31:32.193 --> 31:34.923
Mary. Mary Williams.
You remember her?

31:35.029 --> 31:36.258
There were a lot of Marys, kid.

31:36.365 --> 31:38.492
Shut up! That's my mother
you're talking about!

31:38.600 --> 31:40.363
All right? That's my mother.

31:40.469 --> 31:43.438
You don't have to get sore all the time
just to prove how tough you are.

31:43.538 --> 31:45.699
Sit down. Please. Sit down.

31:47.042 --> 31:50.011
She said if anybody could find the skull,
it's you.

31:50.112 --> 31:54.607
Like you're some type of...
Like a grave robber or something.

31:54.717 --> 31:57.550
I'm a tenured professor of archeology.

31:57.653 --> 32:01.885
Oh, you're a teacher.
Well, that's gonna be a big help.

32:01.991 --> 32:03.959
Anyway, she called me
two weeks ago from South America.

32:04.060 --> 32:06.551
Said she'd escaped,
but they were after her.

32:06.662 --> 32:08.323
She said she'd just gotten
a letter from the Ox

32:08.431 --> 32:10.400
and mailed it to me
so I could give it to you.

32:10.501 --> 32:11.866
Then the line went dead. I opened it.

32:11.969 --> 32:14.403
I mean, the thing's pointless, though.
It's just gibberish.

32:14.505 --> 32:16.871
It's not even English lettering.

32:16.974 --> 32:18.100
See?

32:19.977 --> 32:23.276
See those two bricks over there,
at the counter?

32:23.380 --> 32:25.940
I don't think
they're here for the milkshakes.

32:26.050 --> 32:27.517
Who are they?

32:28.353 --> 32:31.254
Don't know. Maybe FBI.

32:31.356 --> 32:33.085
Come quietly, Dr. Jones.

32:33.191 --> 32:34.590
Make that KGB.

32:34.692 --> 32:37.752
- And bring letter with you.
- Letter? What letter?

32:37.862 --> 32:39.159
Letter Mr. Williams just give you.

32:39.264 --> 32:41.198
Me? Do I look like a mailman?

32:41.299 --> 32:42.994
We don't ask again.
Come now or we'll...

32:43.101 --> 32:44.261
Or what?

32:44.369 --> 32:47.601
Nice try, kid,
but I think you just brought a knife

32:48.941 --> 32:51.205
to a gunfight.

32:51.310 --> 32:52.937
Outside now.

32:57.383 --> 32:58.509
- Hit this guy.
- Who?

32:58.617 --> 33:00.084
Joe College. Hit him hard.

33:00.186 --> 33:02.086
- Here, hold this.
- What?

33:03.156 --> 33:04.953
That's my boyfriend!

33:08.295 --> 33:09.887
Take it outside!

33:09.996 --> 33:11.793
Get that greaser!

33:19.539 --> 33:20.939
Your mom didn't escape.

33:21.042 --> 33:23.806
They let her go,
so she could mail the letter

33:23.911 --> 33:27.108
and you could bring it to me
and I could translate it!

33:29.317 --> 33:31.114
Get on, gramps!

33:59.616 --> 34:01.914
Go, go, go, go, go!

35:11.692 --> 35:15.389
Better dead than Red!
Better dead than Red!

35:18.265 --> 35:21.325
Better dead than Red!
Better dead than Red!

35:21.435 --> 35:24.564
Better dead than Red!
Better dead than Red!

35:26.107 --> 35:29.599
This is crazy!
Somebody's going to get hurt!

35:57.606 --> 35:59.234
Left! Go left! Left!

36:14.457 --> 36:16.221
Move, move! Move!

36:16.961 --> 36:18.223
Split, split! Split, split!

36:18.329 --> 36:20.729
- You're going too fast.
- That's a matter of opinion!

36:33.912 --> 36:36.710
- Excuse me, Dr. Jones.
- Yes?

36:36.815 --> 36:40.148
I just had a question on
Hargrove's normative culture model.

36:40.252 --> 36:41.617
Forget Hargrove.

36:41.720 --> 36:44.780
Read Vere Gordon Childe
on diffusionism.

36:44.890 --> 36:47.017
He spent most of his life in the field.

36:48.026 --> 36:50.996
If you want to be a good archeologist,

36:52.165 --> 36:54.656
you got to get out of the library!

36:59.505 --> 37:00.529
Who is that?

37:00.640 --> 37:03.734
Francisco de Orellana,
the conquistador.

37:03.843 --> 37:06.073
Remember, the guy who got lost
looking for the skull.

37:06.179 --> 37:09.672
And just as I thought.

37:09.783 --> 37:11.751
Koihoma.

37:11.852 --> 37:13.285
What's that?

37:13.387 --> 37:18.347
It's an extinct Latin American language.
Pre-Columbian syllabic base.

37:19.660 --> 37:23.687
See. Diagonal stresses
on the ideograms. Definitely Koihoma.

37:23.797 --> 37:25.628
- You speak it?
- Nobody speaks it.

37:25.733 --> 37:29.067
It hasn't been heard aloud
in 3,000 years.

37:29.170 --> 37:33.402
I might be able to read a bit though
if I walk it through Mayan first.

37:34.275 --> 37:36.709
You know, for an old man,
you ain't bad in a fight.

37:36.811 --> 37:38.540
Thanks a lot.

37:38.646 --> 37:40.580
What are you, like, 80?

37:43.986 --> 37:46.113
It's a riddle.

37:46.222 --> 37:49.714
Leave it to Ox to write a riddle
in a dead language.

37:51.260 --> 37:55.356
"Follow the lines in the earth
only gods can read

37:55.464 --> 37:58.490
"which lead to Orellana's cradle

37:58.601 --> 38:00.866
"guarded by the living dead."

38:00.971 --> 38:03.838
- He's talking about the Nazca Lines.
- What are those?

38:03.974 --> 38:05.271
Hold on here.

38:06.076 --> 38:12.504
Geoglyphs. Giant ancient drawings
carved into the desert floor in Peru.

38:12.616 --> 38:15.380
From the ground,
they don't look like anything.

38:15.485 --> 38:19.081
But from the sky,
only the gods can read them,

38:19.190 --> 38:21.988
because only gods live up there.

38:23.995 --> 38:29.194
Oxley's telling us
the skull is in Nazca, Peru.

39:31.066 --> 39:33.159
Finally. They saw him.

39:33.268 --> 39:36.101
Ox wandered into town a couple
of months ago, raving like a madman.

39:36.204 --> 39:38.604
Police locked him up in the sanitarium.
It's this way.

39:38.707 --> 39:41.141
I took Spanish and I didn't understand
a word of that. What was it?

39:41.243 --> 39:43.404
Quechua, local Incan dialect.

39:43.512 --> 39:46.073
- Where'd you learn that one?
- Long story.

39:46.182 --> 39:47.740
I got time.

39:47.850 --> 39:50.250
I rode with Pancho Villa.
A couple of his guys spoke it.

39:50.353 --> 39:52.014
Bullshit!

39:52.121 --> 39:54.351
- You asked.
- Pancho Villa?

39:54.457 --> 39:57.585
- Technically, I was kidnapped.
- By Pancho Villa?

39:57.693 --> 40:01.151
It was the fight
against Victoriano Huerta.

40:01.264 --> 40:03.425
- How old were you?
- About your age.

40:03.534 --> 40:06.025
Your parents must've had a cow, huh?

40:06.136 --> 40:08.263
It worked out.
Things were a little tense at home.

40:08.372 --> 40:10.237
Yeah, me and my mom
aren't on the best of terms, either.

40:10.340 --> 40:13.776
Treat her right, kid. You only get one
and sometimes not for that long.

40:13.877 --> 40:15.174
It's not my fault. It's hers.

40:15.279 --> 40:16.871
She just got P.O.'ed
because I quit school.

40:16.980 --> 40:18.447
She thinks
I'm some kind of goof or something.

40:18.549 --> 40:20.744
- You quit school?
- Oh, yeah. Sure. Tons of them.

40:20.851 --> 40:22.979
Fancy prep schools
that teach you how to debate

40:23.087 --> 40:24.748
and chess and fencing.

40:24.856 --> 40:26.983
I'm great with the blade.
I just think it's a waste of time.

40:27.091 --> 40:29.150
- You never finished.
- No.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.888
Just a bunch of useless skills.
Wrong books.

40:31.996 --> 40:34.328
'Cause I love reading.
Me and Ox used to read all the time.

40:34.432 --> 40:36.866
But now I can pick them myself.
You get me?

40:36.968 --> 40:39.563
- What do you do for money?
- Fix motorcycles.

40:39.672 --> 40:42.368
Gonna do that
for the rest of your life?

40:42.474 --> 40:44.999
Maybe I will, Teach.
You got a problem with that?

40:45.110 --> 40:47.544
No. Not if that's what you love doing.

40:47.646 --> 40:50.479
Don't let anybody tell you different.

40:50.583 --> 40:52.380
This is it. Sister.

41:12.272 --> 41:15.674
She says Ox isn't here.
She doesn't know where he is.

41:16.877 --> 41:20.779
Some men came and took him away,
men with guns.

41:26.153 --> 41:28.087
She says he was obsessed, deranged.

41:28.189 --> 41:30.657
Drew pictures
all over the walls of his cell.

41:34.830 --> 41:38.266
This riddle in Oxley's letter
doesn't make any sense.

41:38.367 --> 41:43.999
"Follow the lines that only the gods
can read that lead to Orellana's cradle."

41:44.106 --> 41:46.370
Cradle, cradle, birth.

41:46.475 --> 41:49.468
Orellana wasn't born in Peru.
He was born in Spain.

41:49.579 --> 41:51.479
He was a conquistador.
He came here for the gold.

41:51.581 --> 41:52.980
What happened to him?

41:53.082 --> 41:57.280
He disappeared along with six others.
Their bodies were never found.

42:26.551 --> 42:28.746
He must have lost his mind.

42:35.427 --> 42:38.760
Ox, man, what happened?
What happened?

42:46.505 --> 42:49.599
This is not the Mitchell-Hedges skull.

42:49.709 --> 42:52.007
Look at the elongated cranium.

42:52.845 --> 42:54.870
And the same word

42:54.980 --> 42:57.175
in different languages,
over and over again.

43:01.621 --> 43:03.350
Return.

43:03.457 --> 43:05.186
Return where?

43:05.292 --> 43:07.283
Or return what?

43:07.394 --> 43:09.885
You mean the skull?

43:09.996 --> 43:12.487
Seems to have been on his mind.

43:12.599 --> 43:15.227
Where was he supposed to return it to?

43:27.615 --> 43:29.207
- Sweep.
- Yeah.

43:38.861 --> 43:41.489
Ox didn't mean Orellana's birthplace.

43:41.597 --> 43:43.997
Cradle has another meaning in Mayan.

43:44.099 --> 43:49.059
Literally, it means "resting place,"
as in final resting place.

43:49.171 --> 43:51.538
Ox meant Orellana's grave.

43:51.641 --> 43:56.669
This drawing scratched into the floor
is the cemetery where he's buried.

43:57.147 --> 43:59.741
You said Orellana vanished
and nobody ever found his grave.

43:59.849 --> 44:03.615
Well, it looks like Harold Oxley did.

44:34.519 --> 44:36.612
"Grave robbers will be shot."

44:36.721 --> 44:38.689
Good thing we're not grave robbers.

44:46.632 --> 44:49.795
- What are we looking for?
- I don't know yet.

44:50.336 --> 44:53.772
Maybe an antechamber
off one of these barrows.

45:09.590 --> 45:11.148
I think I just saw something!

45:11.258 --> 45:13.522
Oh, you're jumping at shadows.

45:18.198 --> 45:20.133
This way down.

45:29.010 --> 45:31.604
- This way up.
- Yeah.

45:55.906 --> 45:57.806
Those darts are poison!

45:59.509 --> 46:00.976
Stay there.

46:25.369 --> 46:27.997
You're a teacher?

46:29.207 --> 46:30.504
Part-time.

46:40.552 --> 46:41.849
Dead end.

46:43.989 --> 46:45.422
Maybe.

46:51.864 --> 46:53.092
What are you doing?
Put that thing away.

46:53.199 --> 46:55.633
Give me some light over here.

47:01.574 --> 47:03.371
Bring it over here.

47:10.351 --> 47:12.046
It's just a thing.

48:12.149 --> 48:13.673
Dance on your own dime, will you?

48:13.784 --> 48:15.810
One of the scorpions just stung me!
Am I gonna die?

48:15.920 --> 48:18.013
- How big?
- Huge!

48:18.122 --> 48:19.612
- Good.
- Good?

48:21.125 --> 48:23.992
When it comes to scorpions,
the bigger the better.

48:24.095 --> 48:27.462
A small one bites you,
don't keep it to yourself.

48:48.353 --> 48:52.450
Their skulls. Look at their skulls, man.

48:52.559 --> 48:56.188
Like the drawings in Oxley's cell.
Means we're getting closer.

48:56.296 --> 48:58.355
That's crazy. Why is it like that?

48:58.465 --> 49:01.866
Nazca Indians used to
bind their infants' heads with rope

49:01.968 --> 49:03.560
to elongate the skull like that.

49:03.670 --> 49:06.264
- Why?
- Honor the gods.

49:06.372 --> 49:09.604
No, no. God's head is not like that, man.

49:09.710 --> 49:11.803
Depends on who your god is.

49:21.889 --> 49:23.914
You're going nowhere fast.

49:28.930 --> 49:31.398
Professor, this really
is a dead end. Look.

49:38.607 --> 49:39.699
Hey!

49:56.926 --> 49:59.987
Come on, genius. Bring the backpack.

50:17.615 --> 50:20.379
- This is incredible.
- Unreal.

50:23.188 --> 50:25.315
Don't touch anything.

50:28.293 --> 50:30.693
Footprints. Somebody's been here.

50:32.263 --> 50:33.696
Recently.

50:36.769 --> 50:38.396
Two sets of prints.

50:39.838 --> 50:43.604
Same size, could have been
the same person twice.

50:43.709 --> 50:45.176
Not bad, kid.

50:53.253 --> 50:56.848
One. Two.

50:56.957 --> 51:00.290
Three. Four. Five. Six.

51:02.062 --> 51:03.427
Seven.

51:04.164 --> 51:08.191
Orellana and his men might've
made it out of the jungle after all.

51:10.638 --> 51:12.435
Give me some light.

51:18.579 --> 51:20.979
You don't have a knife, do you?

51:44.306 --> 51:46.070
Looks like he just died yesterday.

51:46.175 --> 51:48.871
It's the wrappings. They preserved him.

51:57.520 --> 51:58.509
What just happened?

51:58.621 --> 52:02.558
He's been wrapped up for 500 years.
Air doesn't agree with him.

52:10.267 --> 52:11.632
Thanks.

52:15.973 --> 52:17.838
I don't want to keep
borrowing yours all the time.

52:17.941 --> 52:20.911
- That's fine.
- I was going to put it back.

52:26.651 --> 52:28.676
Is this one open already?

52:47.773 --> 52:50.241
It's him.

52:50.443 --> 52:52.673
It's Orellana himself.

52:57.651 --> 53:01.951
They called him The Gilded Man.
His lust for gold was legendary.

53:03.724 --> 53:05.055
It's odd.

53:07.828 --> 53:10.228
Somebody's been here and gone.

53:10.330 --> 53:16.327
But they left all this gold
and all the artifacts.

53:18.439 --> 53:20.600
What were they looking for?

53:33.756 --> 53:35.485
- Hold this.
- No. No.

53:54.978 --> 53:58.072
Unbelievable.

54:06.891 --> 54:08.722
No tool marks.

54:08.826 --> 54:11.420
A single piece of seamless quartz.

54:13.230 --> 54:15.824
Cut across the grain.

54:15.933 --> 54:20.029
It's not possible, even with
today's technology, it would shatter.

54:26.578 --> 54:28.603
Crystal's not magnetic.

54:28.713 --> 54:30.237
Neither is gold.

54:34.186 --> 54:36.814
What is this thing?

54:36.922 --> 54:41.019
Maybe the Nazca Indians thought
this was their god.

54:41.127 --> 54:43.960
- You think this is the one from...
- From Akator.

54:48.668 --> 54:53.230
Maybe the Spaniards found this skull
along with all this other loot.

54:53.339 --> 54:56.706
They were headed for their ships
along the shore.

54:58.178 --> 55:01.113
Maybe the Indians caught up with them,

55:01.215 --> 55:03.706
or they got to squabbling
amongst themselves

55:03.817 --> 55:07.275
over their prize, kill each other off.

55:07.387 --> 55:10.618
The Indians wrap them up
and bury them.

55:10.724 --> 55:15.788
A couple of hundred years later,
Oxley shows up here, finds the skull.

55:15.897 --> 55:19.492
Takes it away, maybe to Akator.

55:22.170 --> 55:24.661
But then he returns it here.

55:24.772 --> 55:26.467
Return.

55:26.574 --> 55:29.702
Return, like he wrote
on the walls of his cell.

55:30.545 --> 55:34.676
He put it back where he found it. Why?

55:58.708 --> 56:02.303
- Hello, Jonesey.
- Hello, Mac.

56:35.047 --> 56:36.878
You're lucky I turned up, Jonesey.

56:36.982 --> 56:39.212
Dovchenko there wanted
to blow your brains out.

56:39.318 --> 56:42.846
That's the third time I've saved your life.

56:42.956 --> 56:45.049
Unshackle me. I'll give you a big hug.

56:45.158 --> 56:48.059
You had a Luger
pointed at the base of your skull

56:48.161 --> 56:49.924
the first time we met.

56:50.029 --> 56:51.860
I had the situation under control.

56:51.965 --> 56:54.433
- You owe me.
- What do you owe them?

56:56.803 --> 56:57.997
After the war, when you turned,

56:58.104 --> 56:59.264
how many names
did you give the Reds?

56:59.372 --> 57:00.704
You're not looking
at the big picture here.

57:00.808 --> 57:02.799
How many good men died
because of you?

57:02.910 --> 57:05.174
Eventually, they're gonna
let me out of this chair, comrade,

57:05.279 --> 57:08.646
and when they do,
I'm going to break your nose.

57:08.749 --> 57:12.048
"Comrade"?
You think this is about flags?

57:12.152 --> 57:14.518
About uniforms?
You think this is about lines on a map?

57:14.622 --> 57:16.385
It's just about money, isn't it?

57:16.490 --> 57:18.254
No. Not only money.

57:21.363 --> 57:23.763
A gigantic pile of money.

57:24.566 --> 57:26.966
Don't worry about
what the Russians will pay.

57:27.068 --> 57:30.037
It's nothing compared
to what's at Akator.

57:31.272 --> 57:35.607
An entire city of gold.
It's what the conquistadors were after.

57:36.912 --> 57:41.542
For God's sake, Jonesey, we'd be rich!
Richer than Howard Hughes!

57:41.651 --> 57:44.119
Blood money, every nickel.

57:44.220 --> 57:46.415
I need you to see the angle here, mate.

57:46.522 --> 57:49.389
Be smart. Do the right thing.
Just like in...

57:51.260 --> 57:53.786
Like in Berlin. Got me?

57:53.897 --> 57:55.956
Just like in Berlin.

57:56.066 --> 57:59.297
You want me to trot off,
or should we sing a song?

58:00.504 --> 58:04.270
How fortunate our failure to kill you,
Dr. Jones.

58:04.374 --> 58:07.366
You survive
to be of service to us once again.

58:07.477 --> 58:10.413
Well, you know me, always glad to help.

58:10.515 --> 58:15.043
"Now I am become death,
the destroyer of worlds."

58:15.953 --> 58:18.717
You recognize those words?

58:18.823 --> 58:23.226
It was your own Dr. Oppenheimer
after he created the atomic bomb.

58:23.327 --> 58:24.692
He was quoting the Hindu bible.

58:24.796 --> 58:26.855
It was nuclear intimidation.

58:26.964 --> 58:30.958
But now this next level of weapon
is ours to have,

58:31.070 --> 58:32.970
yours to fear.

58:33.072 --> 58:35.540
Weapon? What weapon?

58:35.641 --> 58:37.370
A mind weapon.

58:37.476 --> 58:41.276
A new frontier of psychic warfare.
That was Stalin's dream.

58:43.982 --> 58:48.010
Now I know why Oxley
put the skull back where he found it.

58:48.121 --> 58:49.349
He knew you were looking for it.

58:49.456 --> 58:51.447
That skull is no mere deity carving.

58:51.558 --> 58:53.549
Surely you knew that
the moment you laid eyes on it.

58:53.660 --> 58:56.686
It was not made by human hands.

58:56.796 --> 58:58.525
Who made it, then?

59:01.801 --> 59:03.269
Come on.

59:04.739 --> 59:07.572
The body we found in New Mexico
was not the first.

59:07.675 --> 59:11.543
We'd already dissected two others
from similar crash sites in Soviet Union.

59:11.645 --> 59:13.374
Saucer men from Mars.

59:13.481 --> 59:15.608
The legends about Akator are all true.

59:15.716 --> 59:18.116
Early men could not have conceived it,
much less built it.

59:18.219 --> 59:20.347
It was a city of supreme beings

59:20.455 --> 59:23.515
with technologies
and paranormal abilities.

59:23.625 --> 59:25.991
You got to be kidding me.

59:26.094 --> 59:29.325
Why do you choose
not to believe your own eyes?

59:31.900 --> 59:34.960
The New Mexico specimen
gave us hope.

59:35.070 --> 59:39.906
Unlike the others we'd found,
its skeleton was pure crystal.

59:41.711 --> 59:45.875
A distant cousin, perhaps. Maybe they,
too, were sent to find Akator.

59:45.982 --> 59:49.042
Perhaps we're all searching
for the same thing.

59:51.521 --> 59:56.084
- There is no other explanation.
- There's always another explanation.

59:56.193 --> 01:00:00.425
The skull was stolen from Akator
in the 15th century.

01:00:00.531 --> 01:00:01.657
Whoever returns it...

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:04.165
Returns it to the city temple
will gain control over its powers.

01:00:04.268 --> 01:00:07.203
I've heard that bedtime story before.

01:00:07.304 --> 01:00:10.296
It's a legend.
Why do you think Akator even existed?

01:00:10.407 --> 01:00:12.842
You should ask your friend
that question.

01:00:12.944 --> 01:00:15.174
We're certain he's been there.

01:00:16.281 --> 01:00:17.441
Oxley?

01:00:32.198 --> 01:00:34.496
Ox, it's me, Indy.

01:00:35.367 --> 01:00:36.834
Ox?

01:00:38.404 --> 01:00:40.804
Ox, you're faking it, right?

01:00:40.906 --> 01:00:43.807
"Through eyes that last I saw in tears..."

01:00:43.909 --> 01:00:47.903
Ox, listen to me, pal.
Your name is Harold Oxley.

01:00:48.014 --> 01:00:49.447
You were born in Leeds, England.

01:00:49.549 --> 01:00:52.279
You and I went to school together
at the University of Chicago.

01:00:52.385 --> 01:00:55.616
And you were never this interesting.
My name is...

01:00:57.123 --> 01:00:59.751
My name is Henry Jones, Jr.

01:01:01.194 --> 01:01:02.286
What have you done to him?

01:01:02.395 --> 01:01:04.625
We ain't done a thing.
It's the bloody skull.

01:01:04.731 --> 01:01:07.929
He is the divining rod
that will lead us to Akator.

01:01:08.035 --> 01:01:10.435
But we need someone
to interpret him for us.

01:01:10.538 --> 01:01:15.202
His mind, it seems, is quite weak.
Let's hope yours is stronger.

01:01:17.879 --> 01:01:22.179
The skull's crystal stimulates an
undeveloped part of the human brain,

01:01:22.283 --> 01:01:24.411
opening a psychic channel.

01:01:24.519 --> 01:01:28.580
Oxley lost control of his mind
by staring too long into its eyes.

01:01:28.690 --> 01:01:33.252
We believe you can get through to him
after you have done the same.

01:01:33.362 --> 01:01:36.126
I've got a better idea. You look at it.

01:01:36.231 --> 01:01:39.291
The skull does not speak to everyone,
it seems.

01:01:40.703 --> 01:01:43.263
Surely you're not afraid, Dr. Jones.

01:01:43.373 --> 01:01:45.933
You've spent your entire life
searching for answers.

01:01:46.042 --> 01:01:49.136
Think of the truth behind those eyes.

01:01:49.245 --> 01:01:51.770
There may be
hundreds of skulls at Akator.

01:01:51.881 --> 01:01:54.441
Whoever finds them
will control the greatest natural force

01:01:54.550 --> 01:01:56.677
the world has ever known.

01:01:59.056 --> 01:02:01.581
Power over the mind of man.

01:02:01.692 --> 01:02:05.287
Be careful,
you might get exactly what you wish for.

01:02:05.396 --> 01:02:06.863
I usually do.

01:02:40.132 --> 01:02:42.498
Imagine.

01:02:42.601 --> 01:02:46.264
To peer across the world
and know the enemy's secrets.

01:02:46.372 --> 01:02:49.603
To place our thoughts
into the minds of your leaders.

01:02:49.709 --> 01:02:52.270
Make your teachers
teach the true version of history,

01:02:52.379 --> 01:02:55.041
your soldiers attack on our command.

01:02:55.315 --> 01:02:58.079
We'll be everywhere at once,
more powerful than a whisper,

01:02:58.185 --> 01:02:59.550
invading your dreams,

01:02:59.653 --> 01:03:02.747
thinking your thoughts for you
while you sleep.

01:03:04.691 --> 01:03:07.558
We will change you, Dr. Jones,

01:03:07.661 --> 01:03:10.426
all of you, from the inside.

01:03:10.531 --> 01:03:13.227
We will turn you into us.

01:03:13.334 --> 01:03:18.101
And the best part?
You won't even know it's happening.

01:03:20.508 --> 01:03:21.736
Return.

01:03:24.679 --> 01:03:25.977
Return?

01:03:29.385 --> 01:03:30.875
That's enough.

01:03:33.689 --> 01:03:36.715
That's enough.
If he dies, we can't get there.

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.257
Cover it.

01:03:44.467 --> 01:03:45.798
Henry.

01:03:46.569 --> 01:03:48.594
You all right, Jonesey?

01:03:54.377 --> 01:03:55.742
- You broke my nose!
- I told you.

01:03:55.845 --> 01:04:00.544
Enough! You will speak to Oxley
and lead us to Akator, yes?

01:04:02.453 --> 01:04:04.148
Take him outside.

01:04:10.094 --> 01:04:12.688
- You all right, kid?
- They left my bike at the cemetery.

01:04:12.797 --> 01:04:14.594
- Yeah, but you're all right?
- They left my bike.

01:04:14.698 --> 01:04:18.135
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.

01:04:26.445 --> 01:04:30.313
I'm ready. Don't give these pigs a thing.

01:04:30.415 --> 01:04:31.973
You heard him.

01:04:32.084 --> 01:04:35.542
Clearly I have chosen
the wrong pressure point.

01:04:35.655 --> 01:04:38.419
Perhaps I can find a more sensitive one.

01:04:39.926 --> 01:04:44.158
Get your hands off me,
you rotten Russki son of a bitch!

01:04:47.433 --> 01:04:49.196
Indiana Jones.

01:04:53.173 --> 01:04:54.538
About time you showed up.

01:04:54.641 --> 01:04:56.506
- Mom!
- Sweetheart.

01:04:56.610 --> 01:04:58.237
"Mom"?

01:04:58.345 --> 01:04:59.676
What are you doing here?

01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:01.839
Forget about me. Are you all right?

01:05:01.949 --> 01:05:04.179
- "Mom"?
- Young man, I specifically told you

01:05:04.284 --> 01:05:05.808
- not to come here.
- Marion is your mother?

01:05:05.919 --> 01:05:07.944
You never wrote that.
You never said that in any phone calls.

01:05:08.055 --> 01:05:10.216
Marion Ravenwood is your mother?

01:05:10.324 --> 01:05:13.488
For God's sake, Indy, it's not that hard.

01:05:13.595 --> 01:05:15.529
No, I mean, I just never thought...

01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:17.188
I would have a life after you left.

01:05:17.298 --> 01:05:19.766
- That's not what I meant.
- A damn good life!

01:05:19.868 --> 01:05:23.429
- Well, that's fine.
- A damn good, really good life!

01:05:23.538 --> 01:05:25.005
- Well, so have I!
- Yeah?

01:05:25.106 --> 01:05:26.937
You still leaving
a trail of human wreckage,

01:05:27.041 --> 01:05:28.441
or have you retired?

01:05:28.544 --> 01:05:30.011
Why? You looking for a date?

01:05:30.112 --> 01:05:32.342
With anybody but you.

01:05:32.448 --> 01:05:35.975
So, Dr. Jones, you will help us?

01:05:36.085 --> 01:05:37.518
A simple "yes" will do.

01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:40.088
Oh, Marion, you had to go
and get yourself kidnapped.

01:05:40.189 --> 01:05:42.282
Not like you did any better.

01:05:43.926 --> 01:05:45.689
Same old, same old.

01:05:47.931 --> 01:05:50.058
Henry Jones, Jr.

01:05:51.801 --> 01:05:55.293
- Henry Jones, Jr...
- That's right, Ox. Listen to me.

01:05:55.405 --> 01:05:58.374
"To lay their just hands
on that Golden Key

01:05:58.475 --> 01:06:01.308
- "that ope's the Palace of Eternity."
- Palace of...

01:06:01.411 --> 01:06:03.880
It's from Milton.
He's said it before. Why?

01:06:03.981 --> 01:06:06.472
Ox, you got to tell us
how to get to Akator

01:06:06.584 --> 01:06:07.983
or they're gonna kill Marion.

01:06:08.085 --> 01:06:12.385
"Through eyes that last I saw in tears,
here in death's dream kingdom..."

01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:12.924
Harold, they're gonna kill
Abner's little girl.

01:06:12.924 --> 01:06:15.017
Harold, they're gonna kill
Abner's little girl.

01:06:15.126 --> 01:06:18.186
You got to tell us how to get there.
We need...

01:06:26.071 --> 01:06:27.800
Get me paper. Something to write with.

01:06:39.052 --> 01:06:41.680
Autowriting! I should have seen this.

01:06:45.725 --> 01:06:50.321
- Henry Jones, Jr.
- Right. That's right, Ox.

01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:54.924
Three times it drops. The way down.

01:06:55.335 --> 01:06:57.861
- Three times...
- Pictographs.

01:06:59.573 --> 01:07:01.097
Ideograms.

01:07:09.683 --> 01:07:11.241
Good, Ox. Good.

01:07:23.498 --> 01:07:25.125
Ox?

01:07:26.334 --> 01:07:28.199
It's me, Ox.

01:07:28.303 --> 01:07:33.799
It's Mutt, Ox. Hey, look at me.
Look at me. It's me.

01:07:35.511 --> 01:07:36.739
It's me.

01:07:40.216 --> 01:07:44.118
The wavy lines mean water, of course.
Closed eyes mean sleep.

01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:48.487
The sun with the arc over the sky
stands for time, duration.

01:07:48.592 --> 01:07:51.186
The word "now" is "until."

01:07:51.295 --> 01:07:52.523
These two close together,

01:07:52.629 --> 01:07:55.996
the horizon and the snake,
mean one thought.

01:07:56.099 --> 01:07:58.090
The horizon stood for the world,

01:07:58.201 --> 01:08:01.466
but it didn't mean the Earth.
It meant big, great.

01:08:03.807 --> 01:08:07.539
"The water sleeps
until the great snake."

01:08:07.645 --> 01:08:10.637
These aren't just drawings,
they're directions. Get me a map!

01:08:15.053 --> 01:08:16.987
The great snake is the Amazon,
of course,

01:08:17.087 --> 01:08:20.080
but "sleep," what water sleeps?

01:08:24.196 --> 01:08:27.596
Here! Sono.
The Portuguese word for "sleep."

01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:29.691
Yes, good. Exactly.

01:08:32.004 --> 01:08:35.804
He wants us
to follow this curve of the Sono

01:08:35.908 --> 01:08:39.173
down to where it meets the Amazon
to the southeast.

01:08:39.278 --> 01:08:41.042
After that, I'm not sure.

01:08:41.147 --> 01:08:45.550
Kingdom of dreams, tears and eyes...
I have no idea what he means.

01:08:45.652 --> 01:08:46.640
This could be the route, though.

01:08:46.752 --> 01:08:49.085
It's a completely unexplored part
of the canopy.

01:08:53.526 --> 01:08:55.585
Go, go, go, go, go! Come on!

01:09:02.169 --> 01:09:04.330
- Kid, what the hell are we doing, kid?
- They were going to kill us!

01:09:04.438 --> 01:09:06.667
- Well, maybe.
- Somebody had to do something!

01:09:06.774 --> 01:09:09.037
- Something else would have been good.
- At least I got a plan.

01:09:09.143 --> 01:09:12.510
This is intolerable.
Harold, for God's sake, keep up.

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:21.678
Mom?

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:24.622
- Stay back!
- Stop! Stop! Stop! Don't move.

01:09:24.725 --> 01:09:26.283
Moving makes space,
space will make you sink.

01:09:26.395 --> 01:09:27.589
No, I think I can get out if I can just...

01:09:27.696 --> 01:09:29.254
Stop it!
You're pulling against a vacuum.

01:09:29.363 --> 01:09:31.194
It's like trying to lift a car.
Just stay calm.

01:09:31.299 --> 01:09:32.425
Okay, I'm calm.

01:09:32.533 --> 01:09:33.832
- What is it? Quicksand?
- I'm calm.

01:09:33.935 --> 01:09:35.904
- No, it's a dry sand pit.
- I'm sinking, but I'm calm.

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:37.996
Quicksand is a mix of sand,
mud and water.

01:09:38.107 --> 01:09:39.938
And depending on the viscosity,
it's not as dangerous

01:09:40.042 --> 01:09:41.339
- as people sometimes think.
- For Pete's sake, Jones,

01:09:41.444 --> 01:09:43.002
we're not in school!

01:09:43.112 --> 01:09:46.013
Don't worry. There's nothing
to worry about unless there's a...

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:49.475
A void collapse.

01:09:51.053 --> 01:09:53.352
I'll go get something to pull you out.

01:09:53.457 --> 01:09:55.288
Ox, don't just sit there.

01:09:55.392 --> 01:09:58.088
For God's sake, man, go get help!

01:09:58.996 --> 01:10:01.055
- Help?
- Help!

01:10:01.165 --> 01:10:02.655
Help?

01:10:02.766 --> 01:10:04.131
Help! Go!

01:10:07.204 --> 01:10:09.537
Mutt can be a little impetuous.

01:10:09.641 --> 01:10:11.700
It's not the worst quality in the world.

01:10:12.744 --> 01:10:15.645
Keep your arms above the surface.
When the kid comes back, grab on.

01:10:15.747 --> 01:10:18.841
- Indy, he...
- He's a good kid, Marion.

01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:20.577
You should get off his back
about school.

01:10:20.685 --> 01:10:22.744
- Mutt, I mean...
- Not everybody's cut out for it.

01:10:22.854 --> 01:10:24.515
His name is Henry!

01:10:24.622 --> 01:10:26.112
Henry. Good name.

01:10:26.225 --> 01:10:27.692
He's your son.

01:10:29.762 --> 01:10:31.354
My son?

01:10:31.464 --> 01:10:33.295
Henry Jones the Third.

01:10:36.502 --> 01:10:40.370
Why the hell
didn't you make him finish school?

01:10:40.473 --> 01:10:43.101
- Mom, grab on! Grab it!
- Yeah.

01:10:43.209 --> 01:10:44.507
I got it.

01:10:45.745 --> 01:10:48.908
Come on, Mom! Pull, pull, pull, pull!

01:10:49.015 --> 01:10:50.209
Pull!

01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:54.414
Grab on.

01:10:56.289 --> 01:10:59.019
- Grab it.
- Just grab it, Indy.

01:10:59.159 --> 01:11:00.649
It's a rat snake!

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.695
- Rat snakes aren't that big.
- Well, this one is, all right?

01:11:02.797 --> 01:11:04.389
It's not even poisonous. Now grab on!

01:11:04.499 --> 01:11:06.990
- Go get something else.
- Like what?

01:11:07.101 --> 01:11:08.830
Like a rope or something.

01:11:08.936 --> 01:11:12.099
There's no Sears and Roebuck here!
Grab the snake!

01:11:14.542 --> 01:11:17.705
- Maybe I can touch the bottom.
- There's no bottom. Now grab it.

01:11:17.812 --> 01:11:19.747
No, I think I can feel it with my feet.

01:11:19.848 --> 01:11:22.442
- Grab the snake!
- Stop calling it that!

01:11:22.551 --> 01:11:24.212
It's a snake!
What do you want me to call it?

01:11:24.319 --> 01:11:26.184
- Say "rope."
- What?

01:11:26.288 --> 01:11:28.347
Say "grab the rope."

01:11:28.457 --> 01:11:30.982
- Grab the rope!
- Grab the rope!

01:11:31.093 --> 01:11:32.958
Hold tight. It's slimy.

01:11:33.896 --> 01:11:34.954
Pull!

01:11:41.437 --> 01:11:45.567
Get rid of that thing, will you, Son?

01:11:45.675 --> 01:11:47.267
Afraid of snakes.

01:11:48.912 --> 01:11:50.903
You are one crazy old man.

01:11:54.752 --> 01:11:58.210
Why do you have to do everything
the hard way, Jonesey?

01:12:02.059 --> 01:12:04.050
Good work, Ox. Thanks.

01:12:04.795 --> 01:12:05.853
Help.

01:12:39.595 --> 01:12:43.793
No. No, he was British.
My dad was an RAF pilot.

01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:46.164
He was a war hero,
not some schoolteacher!

01:12:46.269 --> 01:12:49.933
No, sweetheart.
Colin was your stepfather.

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.837
We started dating
when you were three months old.

01:12:51.942 --> 01:12:53.273
He was a good man.

01:12:53.377 --> 01:12:57.541
Wait, wait, wait. Colin?
As in Colin Williams? You...

01:12:58.782 --> 01:13:01.273
You married him? I introduced you!

01:13:01.385 --> 01:13:04.446
I think you gave up your vote
on who I married

01:13:04.556 --> 01:13:07.457
when you decided to break it off
a week before the wedding!

01:13:07.559 --> 01:13:09.891
I think we both knew, Marion,
it wasn't going to work.

01:13:09.995 --> 01:13:12.429
You didn't know that.
Why didn't you ever talk to me about it?

01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:14.395
Because we never had an argument
I won!

01:13:14.499 --> 01:13:16.228
It's not my fault if you can't keep up!

01:13:16.334 --> 01:13:17.460
I didn't want to hurt you!

01:13:17.569 --> 01:13:20.197
For love of God, shut the hell up!

01:13:20.305 --> 01:13:24.265
Didn't you ever wonder years ago
why Ox stopped talking to you?

01:13:24.377 --> 01:13:26.072
He hated that you ran away.

01:13:26.178 --> 01:13:27.577
Would you two just stop?

01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:31.241
Yeah, Marion, let's not let the kid see
mom and dad fight.

01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:33.477
- You're not my dad, okay?
- You bet I am.

01:13:33.586 --> 01:13:34.917
And I got news for you.

01:13:35.021 --> 01:13:37.012
You're gonna go back and finish school.

01:13:37.123 --> 01:13:38.249
Really? What happened to,

01:13:38.357 --> 01:13:39.848
"There's not a damn thing
wrong with it, kid,

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.222
"and don't let anybody else
tell you any different"?

01:13:41.328 --> 01:13:42.556
You don't remember saying that?

01:13:42.662 --> 01:13:44.357
That was before I was your father!

01:13:44.464 --> 01:13:45.897
- You're not my father!
- Oh, yes, he is your father.

01:13:45.999 --> 01:13:47.466
You should have
told me about the kid, Marion.

01:13:47.567 --> 01:13:48.795
I had a right to know.

01:13:48.902 --> 01:13:50.563
You vanished after that.

01:13:50.670 --> 01:13:53.161
- I wrote.
- A year later!

01:13:53.273 --> 01:13:57.074
By then,
Mutt was born and I was married!

01:13:57.178 --> 01:13:58.941
Why are you bothering to tell me now?

01:13:59.047 --> 01:14:01.379
Because I thought we were gonna die!

01:14:01.482 --> 01:14:02.744
Not yet!

01:14:17.232 --> 01:14:18.426
Got it?

01:14:22.871 --> 01:14:24.099
Oh, shit.

01:14:36.553 --> 01:14:39.215
I'm sure I wasn't the only one
to go on with my life.

01:14:39.322 --> 01:14:42.257
There must've been
plenty of women for you over the years.

01:14:42.358 --> 01:14:46.556
Yeah. There were a few,
but they all had the same problem.

01:14:46.663 --> 01:14:48.358
Yeah? What's that?

01:14:50.634 --> 01:14:52.397
They weren't you, honey.

01:15:16.828 --> 01:15:18.887
We got to get Oxley back,
get our hands on that skull

01:15:18.997 --> 01:15:22.194
and get to Akator before they do.
Grab the wheel.

01:15:33.913 --> 01:15:36.040
What's he gonna do now?

01:15:36.149 --> 01:15:38.413
- I don't think he plans that far ahead.
- Yeah.

01:15:39.385 --> 01:15:42.480
- Scooch over, will you, Son?
- Don't call me "son." Don't.

01:15:42.856 --> 01:15:44.721
I think I'd cover my ears if I were you.

01:15:55.636 --> 01:15:57.001
Duck! Duck!

01:16:00.642 --> 01:16:01.973
Move, move!

01:16:04.512 --> 01:16:06.639
Pull up next to that duck.

01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:18.719
Henry Jones, Jr.

01:16:30.673 --> 01:16:32.140
Jones!

01:16:47.424 --> 01:16:49.119
Come on! Come on!

01:17:04.408 --> 01:17:05.705
Get down!

01:17:17.589 --> 01:17:20.524
Ox has got the skull.
Marion, take the wheel.

01:17:20.626 --> 01:17:21.888
That's not fair. She drove the truck.

01:17:21.994 --> 01:17:25.020
Don't be a child.
Find something to fight with.

01:17:34.874 --> 01:17:36.068
Jonesey!

01:17:49.456 --> 01:17:51.219
- Jonesey!
- Hi, Mac.

01:18:26.796 --> 01:18:29.890
- Indy. Indy! Indy!
- Shut up! Shut up!

01:18:29.999 --> 01:18:35.027
- You stupid son of a bitch! I'm CIA.
- CIA.

01:18:35.137 --> 01:18:38.733
I almost screamed it at you in the tent.
I said, "Just like Berlin."

01:18:38.842 --> 01:18:40.776
What were we in Berlin, mate?

01:18:40.877 --> 01:18:42.708
- Double agents!
- The skull!

01:18:42.813 --> 01:18:44.508
Throw me the skull!

01:18:46.717 --> 01:18:48.446
Throw me the skull!

01:19:10.475 --> 01:19:10.875
Riposte.

01:19:10.875 --> 01:19:11.671
Riposte.

01:19:17.082 --> 01:19:19.175
Get on your front foot. Riposte.

01:19:19.284 --> 01:19:21.184
It's not a match, Mom.

01:19:47.081 --> 01:19:51.211
You fight like a young man,
eager to begin, quick to finish.

01:19:51.585 --> 01:19:53.143
Mutt, disengage!

01:20:32.628 --> 01:20:35.096
Hey! Hey, I got the skull!

01:20:35.198 --> 01:20:37.257
- Throw the bag! Throw it!
- Throw the bag!

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.399
- Gun!
- Gun!

01:21:26.018 --> 01:21:29.351
What are you looking at, Daddy-o?
She's getting away!

01:22:27.717 --> 01:22:29.776
This is very dangerous.

01:22:57.748 --> 01:22:59.876
<i>Do svidanya,</i> Dr. Jones.

01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:29.413
Jones!

01:23:32.051 --> 01:23:33.245
Whoa.

01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:35.279
Whoa.

01:23:36.757 --> 01:23:37.815
Whoa!

01:23:42.963 --> 01:23:43.930
Turn!

01:24:16.131 --> 01:24:17.462
- Siafu.
- What?

01:24:17.566 --> 01:24:19.261
Big damn ants! Go!

01:24:32.916 --> 01:24:34.679
Run to the river!

01:24:54.939 --> 01:24:56.600
Get to the river!

01:25:05.684 --> 01:25:07.845
Jump in! Come on! Come on!

01:25:13.558 --> 01:25:15.321
Mom, there's a cliff!

01:28:00.502 --> 01:28:02.993
- Jonesey, come on!
- Get in, Jones!

01:28:19.588 --> 01:28:21.783
- Mom, stop.
- Mom, slow down.

01:28:25.795 --> 01:28:26.955
- Honey, stop.
- Slow down, Mom.

01:28:27.063 --> 01:28:28.724
- You're gonna go off the cliff.
- That's the idea.

01:28:28.831 --> 01:28:31.356
- Bad idea. Give me the wheel.
- Trust me!

01:28:31.467 --> 01:28:32.833
Slow down!

01:29:00.531 --> 01:29:04.160
- Don't ever do that again.
- Yes, dear.

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:17.510
Three times it drops.

01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:23.745
Reverse. Put it in reverse! Full reverse!

01:29:23.856 --> 01:29:25.620
- I'm trying! I'm trying!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mom!

01:29:46.947 --> 01:29:48.437
The way down.

01:29:50.384 --> 01:29:53.478
He means by land. He came by land.

01:29:56.057 --> 01:29:58.321
- Three times it drops?
- Three times it drops.

01:29:58.426 --> 01:29:59.757
What is he talking about?

01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:01.453
He means one!

01:30:04.299 --> 01:30:05.527
Two!

01:30:23.753 --> 01:30:25.050
Three.

01:30:58.990 --> 01:31:02.619
You okay? Babe? Let go.

01:31:02.727 --> 01:31:05.662
"Through eyes that last I saw in tears."

01:31:07.765 --> 01:31:09.960
"The golden vision reappears!"

01:31:13.672 --> 01:31:15.640
Gold. I'm in.

01:31:15.741 --> 01:31:20.337
Through eyes... Through eyes in tears.
We got to go through that waterfall!

01:31:22.414 --> 01:31:26.214
The skull has to be returned.
I'll do it. Nobody else has to come.

01:31:26.318 --> 01:31:28.480
Who cares?

01:31:28.588 --> 01:31:31.455
It's brought us nothing but trouble.

01:31:31.558 --> 01:31:33.992
Look what it did to him.

01:31:34.094 --> 01:31:37.257
- I have to return it.
- Why you?

01:31:37.364 --> 01:31:39.355
Because it told me to.

01:31:52.213 --> 01:31:56.582
- Ochre, iron oxide, charcoal.
- Oxy, stay with us.

01:31:56.684 --> 01:31:58.311
How old is this?

01:31:58.419 --> 01:32:01.547
Four or five thousand years.
Old as the pyramids.

01:32:02.290 --> 01:32:05.488
Look, sun worshippers,
like the Egyptians.

01:32:08.363 --> 01:32:11.560
This is fresh. These were just used.

01:32:25.548 --> 01:32:27.243
More worshippers.

01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:30.547
Yeah, but that's not
the sun they're worshipping.

01:32:36.726 --> 01:32:38.091
Someone came

01:32:41.365 --> 01:32:44.493
and taught the Ugha farming.

01:32:48.639 --> 01:32:50.106
Irrigation.

01:33:00.485 --> 01:33:02.385
Ox, what is it?

01:33:19.205 --> 01:33:21.298
I think I understand, Ox.

01:33:23.876 --> 01:33:25.309
Someone came?

01:33:49.370 --> 01:33:50.837
Are they the same?

01:33:50.938 --> 01:33:52.769
There were more. Look.

01:33:56.711 --> 01:33:58.474
Thirteen in a circle.

01:34:05.821 --> 01:34:07.550
Show us the way, Ox.

01:34:56.340 --> 01:35:00.277
- Let's go. Go, go, go! Run! Run, go!
- Go!

01:35:30.877 --> 01:35:32.640
Indy!

01:35:32.745 --> 01:35:35.306
Jonesey!

01:35:35.416 --> 01:35:36.815
Oxley!

01:35:37.851 --> 01:35:40.843
You were here before.
How did you get past them?

01:35:52.534 --> 01:35:55.628
Come on, Mac. Come on!
Come on, Mac.

01:35:58.440 --> 01:35:59.498
Come on, come on, come on.

01:35:59.607 --> 01:36:01.006
"To lay their just hands
on that Golden Key

01:36:01.109 --> 01:36:02.701
- "that ope's the Palace of Eternity."
- Come on, Ox.

01:36:02.811 --> 01:36:03.903
You did good, Ox. You did good.

01:36:28.305 --> 01:36:31.365
City of gold. So where's all the gold?

01:36:32.742 --> 01:36:34.607
Look at the state of this place.

01:36:34.711 --> 01:36:37.475
What a stupid legend.
What a waste of my time.

01:36:37.581 --> 01:36:42.382
Ox was here before,
but he couldn't get into the temple,

01:36:42.486 --> 01:36:46.253
so he took the skull back
to the cemetery, where he found it.

01:36:47.091 --> 01:36:50.492
"To lay their just hands
on that Golden Key

01:36:50.595 --> 01:36:52.893
"that ope's the Palace of Eternity."

01:36:52.997 --> 01:36:55.465
Key that ope's the palace.

01:36:56.834 --> 01:36:59.428
The obelisk. The obelisk is the key?

01:37:06.979 --> 01:37:09.311
What are you looking for, Ox?

01:37:11.550 --> 01:37:13.245
What are you doing?

01:37:18.190 --> 01:37:21.820
You figured this out in your cell,
didn't you, Professor?

01:37:22.795 --> 01:37:24.558
Excuse me, Professor.

01:37:39.647 --> 01:37:40.944
Well done.

01:37:42.182 --> 01:37:43.877
Go get your own.

01:38:43.113 --> 01:38:44.444
Listen.

01:38:45.983 --> 01:38:47.417
Hear that?

01:38:49.887 --> 01:38:52.014
Get up! Move! Ox, move!

01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:58.690
Faster! Faster!

01:38:58.796 --> 01:39:01.026
Faster! Faster!

01:39:01.132 --> 01:39:02.690
Faster!

01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:05.065
This is not good. Move, Ox! Move!

01:39:05.738 --> 01:39:07.535
Quick! Quick! Quick!

01:39:10.009 --> 01:39:12.603
I don't like this! I don't like it!

01:39:12.711 --> 01:39:14.679
- Mom, come on!
- Jonesey!

01:39:32.032 --> 01:39:34.330
He dropped it. He dropped the skull!

01:39:34.434 --> 01:39:35.628
Okay?

01:39:46.013 --> 01:39:47.310
Hold this.

01:39:50.785 --> 01:39:52.412
Ox, you okay?

01:39:56.258 --> 01:39:57.418
Lovely.

01:39:58.627 --> 01:40:00.458
All right, let's go.

01:40:07.536 --> 01:40:08.764
This way?

01:41:15.941 --> 01:41:17.875
Now that's more like it.

01:41:23.984 --> 01:41:27.886
There are artifacts
from every era of early history.

01:41:27.988 --> 01:41:30.115
Macedonian.

01:41:30.257 --> 01:41:32.817
- Sumerian.
- This place is the mother lode.

01:41:32.926 --> 01:41:34.894
Etruscan. Babylonian.

01:41:34.995 --> 01:41:39.056
There isn't a museum in the world
that wouldn't sell its soul for this lot.

01:41:39.199 --> 01:41:40.257
Early Egyptian.

01:41:40.367 --> 01:41:43.303
Dozens of museums.
Hundreds of them, Jonesey!

01:41:44.205 --> 01:41:45.536
Collectors.

01:41:48.109 --> 01:41:50.043
They were archeologists.

01:42:27.717 --> 01:42:29.344
How do we open it?

01:42:34.859 --> 01:42:38.124
I'll give it back, Ox. I promise.

01:43:57.412 --> 01:44:00.006
No more forever waiting.

01:44:01.449 --> 01:44:03.042
Soon now.

01:44:12.861 --> 01:44:14.761
Sorry, Jonesey.

01:44:14.863 --> 01:44:17.525
So what are you, a triple agent?

01:44:17.633 --> 01:44:20.899
Nah, I just lied about being a double.

01:44:26.309 --> 01:44:28.038
Look at them!

01:44:30.146 --> 01:44:34.776
Still waiting for the return
of the one who was lost.

01:44:39.123 --> 01:44:41.023
They are a hive mind.

01:44:43.027 --> 01:44:47.657
One being physically separate,
but with a collective consciousness.

01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:52.697
More powerful together
than they can ever be apart.

01:45:01.747 --> 01:45:04.307
Imagine what they could tell us.

01:45:04.449 --> 01:45:06.144
I can't imagine.

01:45:06.251 --> 01:45:07.741
Neither could the humans
that built this temple,

01:45:07.853 --> 01:45:08.877
and neither can you.

01:45:08.987 --> 01:45:12.480
Belief, Dr. Jones,
is a gift you have yet to receive.

01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:15.584
My sympathies.

01:45:15.695 --> 01:45:19.290
Oh, I believe, sister.
That's why I'm down here.

01:45:54.135 --> 01:45:57.366
- Mayan. He's speaking Mayan.
- What does he say?

01:45:57.472 --> 01:46:00.100
He says he's grateful and he wants...

01:46:02.277 --> 01:46:03.403
It.

01:46:06.749 --> 01:46:10.515
It wants to give us a gift.

01:46:13.422 --> 01:46:15.185
A big gift.

01:46:16.559 --> 01:46:18.652
Tell me everything you know.

01:46:22.732 --> 01:46:25.565
I want to know everything.
I want to know.

01:46:33.777 --> 01:46:36.245
I've got a bad feeling about this.

01:46:40.918 --> 01:46:42.249
Indy?

01:46:43.121 --> 01:46:44.383
The eyes.

01:47:49.056 --> 01:47:50.752
What are they? Spacemen?

01:47:51.193 --> 01:47:54.560
Interdimensional beings, in point of fact.

01:47:54.663 --> 01:47:56.426
Welcome back, Ox.

01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:09.537
What the hell is that?

01:48:09.645 --> 01:48:12.944
A portal!
A pathway to another dimension!

01:48:13.916 --> 01:48:16.476
I don't think we want to go that way.

01:48:32.069 --> 01:48:33.696
I want to know.

01:48:34.671 --> 01:48:36.161
I want to know.

01:48:37.574 --> 01:48:41.169
Tell me. I'm ready. I want to know.

01:48:47.485 --> 01:48:50.784
Mac! Mac! Come on!

01:48:52.657 --> 01:48:53.715
Mac!

01:48:56.227 --> 01:48:57.888
Mac, damn it, now!

01:49:10.809 --> 01:49:12.208
I can see.

01:49:14.146 --> 01:49:15.443
I can see!

01:49:18.551 --> 01:49:19.745
Grab it!

01:49:24.658 --> 01:49:27.422
Use your legs, Mac. I can't do it alone.

01:49:29.362 --> 01:49:30.727
Jonesey!

01:49:32.232 --> 01:49:34.223
I'm going to be all right.

01:49:42.910 --> 01:49:44.104
No more!

01:49:47.615 --> 01:49:49.810
Cover it. Cover it.

01:50:03.265 --> 01:50:04.323
Go!

01:50:04.433 --> 01:50:06.094
Enough!

01:50:06.635 --> 01:50:08.398
Enough!

01:50:21.217 --> 01:50:22.684
Go! Go!

01:52:43.067 --> 01:52:45.467
Like a broom to their footprints.

01:52:48.139 --> 01:52:51.506
Where did they go? Space?

01:52:52.377 --> 01:52:57.508
Not into space.
Into the space between spaces.

01:53:06.359 --> 01:53:08.088
I don't understand.

01:53:09.729 --> 01:53:12.630
Why this legend of a city of gold?

01:53:12.732 --> 01:53:15.860
The Ugha word for gold
translates as "treasure."

01:53:16.903 --> 01:53:20.031
But their treasure wasn't gold.
It was knowledge.

01:53:20.907 --> 01:53:23.069
Knowledge was their treasure.

01:53:38.825 --> 01:53:41.090
What? We're just going to sit here?

01:53:41.195 --> 01:53:42.856
Night falls quick in the jungle, kid.

01:53:42.964 --> 01:53:44.864
You don't want to
climb down the mountain in the dark.

01:53:44.966 --> 01:53:46.160
No?

01:53:47.468 --> 01:53:50.926
I can. Who's coming with me?
Come on.

01:53:51.039 --> 01:53:53.507
Why don't you stick around, Junior?

01:53:56.044 --> 01:53:58.980
I don't know. Why didn't you, Dad?

01:54:01.116 --> 01:54:02.549
Dad!

01:54:06.188 --> 01:54:07.485
Dad?

01:54:12.494 --> 01:54:15.020
Somewhere your grandpa is laughing.

01:54:31.781 --> 01:54:35.445
Marvelous! Perfect!
Make the letters bigger, much bigger.

01:54:48.199 --> 01:54:51.931
Henry Jones, Jr.,
and Marion Ravenwood,

01:54:52.037 --> 01:54:57.031
insomuch in that you two have agreed
to live together in holy matrimony,

01:54:57.142 --> 01:55:00.305
have promised your love for each other
by these vows

01:55:00.412 --> 01:55:03.745
the joining of your hands
and the giving of these rings,

01:55:03.849 --> 01:55:06.750
I now declare you
to be husband and wife.

01:55:07.654 --> 01:55:12.318
Whom God hath put together,
let no one tear asunder.

01:55:12.425 --> 01:55:15.326
"How much of human life
is lost in waiting!"

01:55:16.529 --> 01:55:18.087
Congratulations.

01:55:18.865 --> 01:55:20.924
You may kiss your bride.

01:55:41.555 --> 01:55:42.399
Well done,
Henry!

01:55:43.324 --> 01:55:45.292
- Thanks, Ox.
- Thanks, Ox.
