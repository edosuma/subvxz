00:11.960 --> 00:15.000
Stasi Prison, East Berlin, East Germany

00:15.080 --> 00:16.080
(Squeaking doors)

00:19.240 --> 00:20.040
Number two.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.400
Come with me.

00:23.280 --> 00:24.840
(Footsteps)

00:30.200 --> 00:33.960
(Patriotic, anthemic song,
"The Song of Turbulent Youth," sets in)

00:44.880 --> 00:46.000
(Door squeaks)

00:58.800 --> 00:59.960
Get in!

01:16.600 --> 01:17.640
(A crow squawks)

01:18.480 --> 01:20.240
OUR HEART AND OUR HAND FOR SOCIALISM

01:20.320 --> 01:21.240
Children.

01:21.320 --> 01:22.600
Orphanage, East Germany

01:22.680 --> 01:25.040
Today is not only a new day.

01:25.960 --> 01:29.000
For some of you, it will be
the beginning of a new life.

01:30.160 --> 01:34.400
Your parents abandoned you
for a life in the West.

01:34.480 --> 01:35.720
(Song fades)

01:35.800 --> 01:38.640
But just because they chose

01:38.720 --> 01:43.200
to pursue lives driven
by individual ambition and greed,

01:43.600 --> 01:46.920
doesn't mean
you must also reject our ideals.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.640
You may now be orphans,

01:48.960 --> 01:50.360
but we are here

01:51.480 --> 01:52.960
to take care of you.

01:53.560 --> 01:56.960
The German Democratic Republic
takes care of its children.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.000
Peace and Socialism

02:00.600 --> 02:02.120
at the ready!

02:02.200 --> 02:03.760
Always ready!

02:05.320 --> 02:06.280
You two.

02:07.960 --> 02:09.800
Peace and Socialism

02:09.880 --> 02:11.160
at the ready!

02:11.240 --> 02:12.200
Always ready.

02:12.440 --> 02:13.240
Again.

02:13.600 --> 02:14.440
And louder!

02:14.520 --> 02:15.440
(Whacks her stick)

02:15.640 --> 02:17.320
Peace and Socialism

02:17.520 --> 02:18.520
at the ready!

02:18.600 --> 02:19.760
Always ready!

Kleinmachnow, East Germany

03:01.400 --> 03:05.480
If we divert the weapons to the ANC
when the boat docks in Angola

03:05.840 --> 03:07.680
they'll never make it to Cape Town.

03:08.440 --> 03:11.840
I'm not sure we have enough
ANC comrades on the ground.

03:12.360 --> 03:13.560
(Door closes)

03:13.720 --> 03:15.920
Then we'll sell them to the MPLA.

03:16.480 --> 03:17.800
(A dog whimpers)

03:17.880 --> 03:20.600
The important thing
is they get into the right hands.

03:21.520 --> 03:22.440
So,

03:22.760 --> 03:24.520
what are you two plotting?

03:24.960 --> 03:26.000
Top-secret.

03:29.280 --> 03:30.840
But you would like it.

03:33.720 --> 03:34.920
(Dog whimpers, pants)

03:43.320 --> 03:44.160
Listen.

03:45.560 --> 03:47.840
Officially, I can't tell you anything.
You know that.

03:49.840 --> 03:51.520
But I asked around.

03:52.880 --> 03:55.720
And I can tell you
with absolute certainty,

03:56.400 --> 03:57.440
Martin is alive.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.200
And is doing well.

04:01.760 --> 04:02.760
Really?

04:05.600 --> 04:06.720
I'm sure.

04:09.560 --> 04:11.840
(Sighs with relief)

04:20.720 --> 04:22.240
Tell me everything you know.

04:23.160 --> 04:26.280
I don't know much more.
And I'm not allowed to tell you more.

04:31.240 --> 04:32.280
Thank you.

04:32.960 --> 04:34.400
(Voices hollering)

04:37.680 --> 04:39.480
(Ambient music sets in)

04:45.160 --> 04:46.640
(An echoing throb)

04:46.720 --> 04:47.720
Microfilm?

04:50.360 --> 04:51.160
What?

04:51.240 --> 04:54.240
I thought my weapons deal
with the Libyans was enough.

04:54.440 --> 04:55.880
The microfilm is on top.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.520
As a bonus.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.120
Well-coded BND intelligence information.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.520
It should keep the HVA analysts
occupied for a week or two.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.200
And when they finally do decode it,

05:08.280 --> 05:10.720
they'll be rewarded with
some valuable information.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.720
And where did I get this?

05:16.400 --> 05:17.640
From me, of course.

05:18.640 --> 05:19.760
Like everything else.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.080
You shamelessly used me
to get everything you wanted.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.000
(Quiet music continues)

05:33.640 --> 05:35.600
They'll send Annett to debrief you.

05:37.120 --> 05:38.400
How do you know?

05:38.680 --> 05:40.120
(Music fades into silence)

05:40.520 --> 05:42.440
Because that's exactly what I'd do.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.760
She'll try to use Max
as emotional blackmail.

05:46.840 --> 05:48.520
Would you do that, too?

05:49.760 --> 05:50.800
Of course.

05:54.240 --> 05:55.240
Anything else?

05:57.400 --> 05:58.440
Your mission.

05:58.520 --> 05:59.480
Lenora.

06:00.200 --> 06:03.320
After you bring her here,
Mrs. Netz and the BND will be busy.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.560
And we can disappear.

06:07.440 --> 06:08.960
Mrs. Netz is your contact.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.480
She'll arrange passage
for the three of you.

06:11.560 --> 06:12.640
For Lenora,

06:13.360 --> 06:14.760
for Max and for you.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.440
And I'll be waiting.

06:20.760 --> 06:21.760
For you.

06:23.160 --> 06:24.240
And for Max.

06:25.160 --> 06:27.560
(Synth tones set in)

06:28.120 --> 06:29.440
I'll come back.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.680
I promise.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.240
If you don't, I'll kill you.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.440
(Synth turns bass-heavy)

06:52.480 --> 06:53.840
(Electro buzz)

06:53.920 --> 06:54.960
Get out! Go.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.240
Faster!

06:57.120 --> 06:58.360
Come with me!

07:00.680 --> 07:01.640
Get out.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.000
(Xylophone and synth tones)

07:13.560 --> 07:14.560
Change your clothes!

07:16.640 --> 07:18.240
(Distant shouting)

07:20.920 --> 07:22.520
(A buzzing, a door creaks)

07:32.080 --> 07:33.760
But where's my husband and children?

07:34.240 --> 07:35.080
Over there.

07:35.160 --> 07:36.240
Now move on!

07:56.520 --> 07:57.320
Tina.

07:58.560 --> 07:59.480
Move on!

08:17.120 --> 08:18.360
(Synth fades)

08:18.440 --> 08:19.560
Welcome home.

08:22.280 --> 08:23.320
Where's my mother?

08:24.200 --> 08:25.240
We'll surprise her.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.360
Now?

08:28.440 --> 08:29.400
No.

08:29.680 --> 08:31.520
We need to go into the office first.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.400
The others have some questions for you.

08:34.320 --> 08:36.800
After all, you've been
around the world and back.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.040
Why didn't you stop the bombing?

08:42.360 --> 08:43.400
I tried.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.320
-Did you forward my message?
-Mm-hm.

08:46.520 --> 08:49.840
I couldn't stop the bomb,
but I did stop the investigation.

08:50.240 --> 08:53.080
The CIA believed you were responsible

08:53.720 --> 08:56.120
and there was a lot of evidence
pointing in your direction.

08:56.200 --> 08:59.160
I gave them proof
that you had nothing to do with it.

08:59.320 --> 09:00.640
Oh, well, thanks.

09:01.160 --> 09:03.000
After all, you are my only son.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.720
(Melancholy piano tones set in)

09:09.520 --> 09:13.160
Border Crossing, West Berlin Side

09:17.680 --> 09:18.840
Welcome to the West.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.880
(Relieved noises)

09:32.760 --> 09:36.160
Excuse me, will there be more prisoners
coming over here today?

09:36.240 --> 09:38.200
I'm sorry, I couldn't tell you.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.360
(A car drives past)

09:50.720 --> 09:53.520
BORDER CROSSING

10:06.680 --> 10:07.760
(The motor turns off)

10:09.920 --> 10:10.800
Tina!

10:15.880 --> 10:17.640
(Piano becomes more lyrical)

10:20.600 --> 10:22.080
(Music seems to close)

10:23.280 --> 10:24.440
Where are the children?

10:24.520 --> 10:26.520
I thought they crossed
with you and Christoph.

10:26.600 --> 10:27.520
(Eerie buzz)

10:27.680 --> 10:28.480
No.

10:28.560 --> 10:29.960
(Reprise of melancholy tones)

10:30.160 --> 10:31.600
How long have you been here?

10:32.520 --> 10:33.520
Not long.

10:34.840 --> 10:35.920
Oh, God.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.640
-No, wait.
-Thomas!

10:38.320 --> 10:39.240
Wait.

10:41.960 --> 10:43.960
(A buzz drowns out the piano)

10:45.720 --> 10:47.920
(The piano echoes, a buzzing continues)

10:50.480 --> 10:54.520
East German Foreign Intelligence Service

SPECIAL OPERATING PROCEDURE

12:09.760 --> 12:11.040
(A door opens)

12:11.920 --> 12:12.760
He's here.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.840
(The door creaks, breaks the silence)

12:42.840 --> 12:43.960
Welcome back, Comrade Rauch.

12:44.320 --> 12:45.520
And thank you.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.920
Your service to the nation
during your time abroad

12:48.120 --> 12:49.600
has not gone unnoticed.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.600
I was teaching Angolan children
German for three years.

12:53.840 --> 12:54.920
Exactly.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.800
Faust was very well received.

12:59.080 --> 13:02.040
The kids understood what it means
to bargain with the devil.

13:05.520 --> 13:08.440
You have also had
considerable success in the field.

13:09.360 --> 13:12.280
If you could now learn
to send us your reports regularly...

13:12.560 --> 13:13.400
Gladly.

13:13.840 --> 13:17.320
If you promise not to leave me
on my own out there next time.

13:21.840 --> 13:25.280
I understand that you have now
infiltrated the BND?

13:34.240 --> 13:35.360
Indeed.

13:35.720 --> 13:36.680
Wonderful.

13:38.760 --> 13:42.760
I'm off to the annual
Party members' celebrations in Rostock.

13:43.440 --> 13:44.280
Our ship...

13:44.360 --> 13:48.000
At the request of Comrade Dietrich,
we chose the name of a woman this time.

13:48.480 --> 13:51.200
The MS Rosa Luxemburg sets sail tomorrow.

13:52.720 --> 13:55.600
And I look forward
to a full report upon my return,

13:55.680 --> 13:56.800
Comrade Schneider.

13:59.800 --> 14:00.720
Shall we begin?

14:03.600 --> 14:04.720
You play the piano now?

14:04.800 --> 14:05.640
(Door opens)

14:08.200 --> 14:09.040
So.

14:10.440 --> 14:11.440
Coffee?

14:11.800 --> 14:13.080
It's the good stuff.

14:13.600 --> 14:14.640
I'd rather not.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.560
Are you sure it's not contaminated?

14:17.000 --> 14:17.880
Dead certain.

14:17.960 --> 14:19.680
All right. Can we start?

14:26.320 --> 14:27.840
Let's start at the beginning.

14:30.360 --> 14:32.800
Born in Munich in 1952.

14:32.960 --> 14:35.520
168cm tall, red hair,

14:36.160 --> 14:37.440
no children.

14:39.040 --> 14:43.720
It says she's the wife of the West German
Trade Commissioner to South Africa.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.720
But in fact she is a secret operative
for West German intelligence.

14:47.880 --> 14:49.680
What exactly is your question?

14:50.120 --> 14:53.440
What is the nature of your relationship
with Brigitte Winkelmann?

14:54.800 --> 14:56.720
Brigitte Winkelmann is a sensual,

14:57.360 --> 14:58.760
emotional woman

14:59.160 --> 15:01.040
who feels trapped in her marriage.

15:01.640 --> 15:05.400
The easiest way to access her was
to form an intimate, sexual relationship.

15:06.920 --> 15:08.840
If that's what you want to know.

15:10.120 --> 15:12.640
But the intercourse
was purely for professional purposes.

15:13.160 --> 15:14.240
(A spoon taps crockery)

15:14.320 --> 15:16.080
I met her in Cape Town

15:16.160 --> 15:18.240
and then ascertained she was a BND agent

15:18.320 --> 15:20.760
working with enemy factions
in southern Africa,

15:20.840 --> 15:22.680
such as the SADF and UNITA.

15:24.320 --> 15:26.000
So I decided to seduce her.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.200
Through her I got
very interesting information.

15:32.040 --> 15:33.120
She's the only woman,

15:33.200 --> 15:36.960
and the only West German,
on a top-secret terrorism task force.

15:37.640 --> 15:40.200
Sharing intelligence cross-nationally
among Western allies.

15:40.280 --> 15:42.080
Sounds like a tough nut to crack.

15:42.520 --> 15:43.560
Not really.

15:48.040 --> 15:48.880
(Sighs)

15:49.040 --> 15:53.400
So you spent most of the month of April
together in Paris?

15:53.640 --> 15:54.440
Yes.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.680
The task force is located in Paris.

15:57.280 --> 16:00.200
"The soft, the supple step
and sturdy pace,

16:01.800 --> 16:04.120
that in the smallest of all circles turns

16:04.200 --> 16:07.440
moves like a dance of strength
around a core

16:08.520 --> 16:11.280
in which a mighty will
is standing stunned."

16:12.160 --> 16:13.440
(Bemused pause)

16:14.920 --> 16:15.800
What was that?

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Rilke.

16:18.480 --> 16:19.560
A poem

16:20.160 --> 16:21.680
about a panther in Paris.

16:22.240 --> 16:24.120
The panther in that poem lives in a cage.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.800
I've always wanted to see
Paris in the spring.

16:33.320 --> 16:34.760
Does Brigitte Winkelmann know you're here?

16:34.920 --> 16:35.920
Yes.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.760
She thinks I'm working for her.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.280
HVA 101, old school.

16:41.880 --> 16:42.920
Right?

16:43.840 --> 16:45.680
(Film case clacks, its echo extends)

16:47.760 --> 16:50.160
-What's that?
-Secret BND files.

16:50.600 --> 16:51.560
On microfilm.

16:51.760 --> 16:52.920
(Ambient synth tones)

16:53.080 --> 16:54.760
Hartmann can get the information analyzed.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.160
As soon as we know what's on there,

16:58.240 --> 16:59.920
we'll feed her disinformation.

17:00.720 --> 17:01.680
Through me.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.040
Ah, so now you're a double agent?

17:04.120 --> 17:07.400
No, a double agent works for two
organizations at the same time, Annett.

17:08.160 --> 17:11.120
I'm 100% loyal to only one organization.

17:11.200 --> 17:12.640
The HVA.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.560
-Does that mean you're here to stay?
-Where else would I go?

17:15.640 --> 17:16.920
Paris, maybe?

17:18.200 --> 17:21.720
Are there familial reasons
why you would want to stay here?

17:21.800 --> 17:22.880
Max.

17:24.280 --> 17:26.200
I'd like to see him at some point.

17:26.280 --> 17:27.680
"At some point."

17:29.160 --> 17:30.680
Sadly, he's not home right now.

17:30.760 --> 17:32.480
-Where is he, then?
-Well...

17:33.640 --> 17:34.760
On a trip.

17:35.440 --> 17:36.560
With his kindergarten.

17:36.760 --> 17:37.960
There's no rush.

17:38.280 --> 17:39.160
Good.

17:39.440 --> 17:41.320
(Street bustle)

17:52.320 --> 17:54.760
Their names weren't on the list
for today's crossing.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.920
Why would they send me over
but keep my family?

18:01.080 --> 18:03.360
It... must be an administrative error.

18:03.440 --> 18:05.400
They'll come over with the next exchange.

18:06.920 --> 18:10.160
Let's go back to my place
and figure out what to do next. You...

18:11.360 --> 18:12.760
You need some rest.

18:14.240 --> 18:15.760
I can't leave.

18:16.080 --> 18:17.120
Tina, please.

18:18.120 --> 18:20.280
Christoph was in the same prison as I was.

18:20.360 --> 18:21.880
He's probably still there.

18:21.960 --> 18:23.680
But where are Sandra and Steffi?

18:23.840 --> 18:24.960
(A synth buzzes)

18:25.040 --> 18:26.360
They could be anywhere.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.880
And if by some
terrible administrative error

18:28.960 --> 18:31.600
they're sent over here
in the middle of the night?

18:32.600 --> 18:33.760
And I'm not here?

18:35.600 --> 18:36.760
Then they'll think...

18:37.360 --> 18:39.000
(Eerie keyboard tones)

18:41.080 --> 18:43.760
Is it possible that Martin Rauch
is involved in this?

18:45.240 --> 18:46.640
Martin Rauch? Why?

18:46.840 --> 18:47.760
Why Martin?

18:48.600 --> 18:50.880
I don't know.
I just crossed paths with him.

18:51.080 --> 18:52.920
He was heading into East Germany.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.400
(A doorbell buzzes)

19:08.920 --> 19:09.800
Mama.

19:13.080 --> 19:13.880
Hey.

19:14.200 --> 19:15.080
(Nervous giggling)

19:15.240 --> 19:16.120
It's okay.

19:17.440 --> 19:18.240
Hey.

19:19.040 --> 19:19.840
I'm back.

19:19.920 --> 19:20.720
Oh, God.

19:21.840 --> 19:22.840
Are you all right?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.080
(Suppresses tears)

19:28.400 --> 19:29.480
I'm fine.

19:30.680 --> 19:31.480
It's okay.

19:31.560 --> 19:32.360
I'm fine.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.200
(Sighs, laughs for joy)

19:43.760 --> 19:44.720
You lost weight.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.480
-Does anyone else know you're here?
-It's all official, Ingrid.

19:54.000 --> 19:54.880
Come here.

19:56.600 --> 19:57.680
Do you have tea?

20:08.560 --> 20:10.320
-Milk is not a good idea.
-Hm?

20:10.880 --> 20:11.680
Why?

20:11.760 --> 20:12.680
The radiation.

20:13.520 --> 20:15.240
We are speaking openly about Chernobyl.

20:15.320 --> 20:17.320
Of course. Then we'll drink black tea.

20:17.400 --> 20:18.640
From China.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.920
Mama, why are you living
in such a small apartment?

20:21.560 --> 20:24.240
It is a bit small.
But it's warm and comfortable.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.080
Why is my mother living in
a small apartment?

20:28.160 --> 20:30.440
It's warm and comfortable, she likes it.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.280
-Is this a punishment because of me?
-Now.

20:32.720 --> 20:33.960
Let's have some tea!

20:34.560 --> 20:37.120
The house was too much for me

20:37.200 --> 20:38.280
after the operation.

20:38.360 --> 20:40.760
Walter was kind enough
to find me a new apartment.

20:40.840 --> 20:41.640
"Kind enough?"

20:42.560 --> 20:44.040
What's wrong with you?

20:44.520 --> 20:47.400
The waiting list
for a place like this is ten years.

20:47.640 --> 20:48.480
Hm.

20:51.920 --> 20:53.000
Do you have visitors?

20:53.080 --> 20:55.960
Lenora has been staying with me
with her friend Rose.

20:56.360 --> 20:58.000
-Rose?
-You know her?

20:58.080 --> 21:01.640
Don't worry. There's room for everyone.
I'll make up a bed for you, hm?

21:06.360 --> 21:07.320
Where are they now?

21:07.400 --> 21:08.520
They're away

21:08.680 --> 21:09.880
for a celebration.

21:09.960 --> 21:10.760
Rostock.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.480
Hotel Panorama, Rostock, East Germany

21:14.560 --> 21:16.040
(Synth melody sets in)

21:16.120 --> 21:17.320
Welcome.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.040
HOTEL PANORAMA WELCOMES
THE DISTINGUISHED S.E.D. COMRADES

21:23.120 --> 21:24.080
Enjoy your stay.

21:24.160 --> 21:26.040
(Bustle, chatter)

21:27.960 --> 21:28.800
Hello.

21:29.240 --> 21:30.720
-Hello.
-Rauch and Seithathi.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.160
Please fill this out.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.280
-You're only staying one night?
-Just one night.

21:40.720 --> 21:41.680
And just one bed.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.440
It'll be very nice weather tomorrow.

21:51.080 --> 21:51.960
Sunny.

21:52.240 --> 21:53.160
Like in Africa.

21:53.640 --> 21:54.720
Really?

21:54.800 --> 21:58.200
I heard that the radioactive cloud
is headed straight for Rostock.

21:58.800 --> 21:59.680
Don't worry.

22:00.080 --> 22:02.520
We'll go to the sauna
and just sweat it out.

22:03.320 --> 22:04.520
(Ominously booming synth)

22:04.600 --> 22:05.400
Yes.

22:05.480 --> 22:08.560
The communication system for Vula
must have arrived today.

22:09.440 --> 22:12.200
We need to send a message
to Sanjev as soon as possible.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.800
(A whooshing)

22:22.200 --> 22:23.720
(Whooshing fades, kisses are exchanged)

22:32.640 --> 22:34.440
(Ominous, industrial tones)

22:35.120 --> 22:39.320
Café Wedekind, West Berlin, West Germany

22:39.400 --> 22:40.880
(A piano tinkles)

22:44.200 --> 22:45.920
-What will you drink?
-No time, thanks.

22:46.320 --> 22:47.920
I have to leave for Switzerland.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.120
-But you just got here.
-I know, I know.

22:50.840 --> 22:52.040
It's just for one night.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.360
I'm finished with this job.

22:54.440 --> 22:55.400
What?

22:55.480 --> 22:59.400
I know Cape Town has been hard for you.
So far from Germany, from your mother.

22:59.840 --> 23:01.280
This is my last work trip.

23:01.360 --> 23:03.080
-Where are you going?
-Bonn.

23:03.480 --> 23:04.720
I thought you said Switzerland?

23:05.640 --> 23:06.520
I meant Bonn.

23:07.440 --> 23:09.600
I'm going to Bonn to hand in my notice.

23:11.320 --> 23:12.320
(Stutters slightly)

23:12.400 --> 23:14.040
But your whole life...

23:14.120 --> 23:15.600
Yes, it's been long enough.

23:16.200 --> 23:17.840
We need more time together.

23:18.360 --> 23:20.040
You and me, somewhere in the countryside.

23:20.960 --> 23:24.280
We could go to the chalet in Austria
for a few months.

23:24.800 --> 23:25.800
Just...

23:27.280 --> 23:28.360
to relax.

23:28.920 --> 23:29.960
That would be great.

23:33.040 --> 23:34.560
What would I be without you?

23:35.720 --> 23:37.640
-See you tomorrow, sweetheart.
-See you tomorrow.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.000
(The piano continues)

23:59.200 --> 24:01.400
(Piano meanders to a close)

24:22.240 --> 24:23.920
How did Max react to my letters?

24:26.760 --> 24:28.000
Was he happy?

24:33.480 --> 24:34.920
You gave them to him, right?

24:37.040 --> 24:38.000
Not yet.

24:38.760 --> 24:39.960
He's only three.

24:41.320 --> 24:44.640
Someday the time will come for the boy
to read the 100 letters

24:45.280 --> 24:47.040
from a man he's never met.

24:47.120 --> 24:48.600
Where are those letters?

24:50.160 --> 24:51.800
At my house. Don't worry.

24:52.400 --> 24:53.560
In a box somewhere.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.320
In a box somewhere?

24:56.440 --> 24:57.880
In a box somewhere?

24:59.240 --> 25:00.320
-Martin.
-No, Mama.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.400
Wait, I'm trying to understand this.

25:03.400 --> 25:07.480
You never wrote to me when I was a child.
You never called or came by, either.

25:07.640 --> 25:08.680
Not once.

25:09.600 --> 25:12.040
You were the crappiest father
a son could have.

25:12.120 --> 25:13.680
Do you know that?

25:13.760 --> 25:15.760
And when I try to do a better job,

25:15.960 --> 25:18.840
and write letters to my son,
you put them in some box?

25:19.400 --> 25:21.080
And you think that's all right?

25:24.520 --> 25:27.160
Do you have
a box full of letters for me?

25:29.040 --> 25:31.560
I'm old enough.
You could read them to me now.

25:33.800 --> 25:35.200
You must be hungry, Martin.

25:35.360 --> 25:39.240
Let Walter go back to work.
I'll make you something to eat.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.360
Yes, I have to leave.

25:43.560 --> 25:45.520
I still have to organize a few things

25:47.440 --> 25:49.320
for the workers' cruise.

25:53.480 --> 25:55.520
-Everyone's else is going to Rostock.
-I'm not.

25:57.560 --> 25:59.560
I do all my work from my desk.

26:03.280 --> 26:04.960
(Door opens)

26:05.200 --> 26:07.520
(Piano sets in, door closes)

26:15.600 --> 26:16.520
Thomas!

26:20.040 --> 26:20.840
Hey.

26:20.920 --> 26:22.840
I wanted to see if I could help.

26:22.920 --> 26:25.760
Well,
she'll sit here for the next ten years.

26:26.240 --> 26:28.520
-She has to come home and sleep.
-I know.

26:31.480 --> 26:32.480
Tina.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.600
I'm Maike, Thomas' girlfriend.

26:36.160 --> 26:37.840
I spoke to our friend, Tischbier.

26:38.680 --> 26:42.160
He works with the government
on the East-West exchanges.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.440
He worked on yours.

26:45.440 --> 26:47.760
He says we can go
see the Ministry tomorrow.

26:50.800 --> 26:52.280
And if that doesn't work,

26:52.840 --> 26:54.080
we'll go to the press.

26:54.160 --> 26:55.200
To the press?

26:55.640 --> 26:59.800
That could backfire. She ended up in jail
after we played her tape on public radio.

26:59.880 --> 27:01.800
Thomas, that was a mistake.

27:04.440 --> 27:05.480
What did you do?

27:05.560 --> 27:07.000
(Strings set in)

27:07.160 --> 27:09.200
I accidentally played
the tape you made on the radio

27:10.520 --> 27:11.360
I'm sorry.

27:13.240 --> 27:16.840
We'll do everything to get the kids
on the list for the next round, okay?

27:17.400 --> 27:18.240
Come on.

27:18.400 --> 27:19.560
Please come home.

27:19.640 --> 27:21.320
Leave me alone. Go away.

27:21.680 --> 27:23.400
-Tina, please.
-No, go away!

27:23.560 --> 27:24.360
Tina, please.

27:24.760 --> 27:25.560
No!

27:25.800 --> 27:27.160
I don't want...

27:27.240 --> 27:28.360
Tina, I promise...

27:28.440 --> 27:30.640
I want my children back!

27:30.800 --> 27:32.000
(She wails)

27:34.160 --> 27:36.680
(Music rises, falls)

27:38.240 --> 27:40.000
I promise everything
will be alright. Okay?

27:52.280 --> 27:55.040
(Classical piano etude)

28:57.040 --> 28:59.040
I'LL BE BACK SOON

28:59.440 --> 29:01.040
(Piano echoes, fades away)

29:09.600 --> 29:12.080
(Classical music, wind instruments)

29:21.280 --> 29:23.320
I received confirmation from Sanjev.

29:24.280 --> 29:26.200
He's just waiting for our go-ahead.

29:26.480 --> 29:28.720
He'll help to divert the weapons

29:28.800 --> 29:31.680
into the hands of the MK comrades
during the landing in Angola.

29:31.760 --> 29:33.040
Very good.

29:36.160 --> 29:38.040
I'm just sorry we'll be separated again.

29:40.760 --> 29:42.000
But not for long.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.680
Have I told you already?

29:45.320 --> 29:46.360
What?

29:47.560 --> 29:49.760
I've already booked
my ticket back to Cape Town.

29:50.320 --> 29:51.600
(Giggling)

29:52.480 --> 29:53.520
(Kiss)

29:56.480 --> 29:58.080
We'll meet in a week.

30:00.360 --> 30:01.760
Be very careful.

30:01.960 --> 30:04.400
The SADF has mercenaries everywhere.

30:04.680 --> 30:05.800
You know that.

30:07.960 --> 30:09.600
(Chatter, bustle)

30:10.360 --> 30:11.320
Comrade Seithathi.

30:11.400 --> 30:12.320
Congratulations.

30:12.400 --> 30:13.200
Thank you.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.240
-Comrade Rauch.
-Comrade Fuchs.

30:16.320 --> 30:19.080
I will be pleased to accompany
the distinguished workers on the boat

30:19.160 --> 30:21.480
and teach them about
the perils of imperialism.

30:21.560 --> 30:23.480
And I'm sure you'll make sure
they understand

30:23.560 --> 30:26.840
why South Africa
must finally be freed from apartheid.

30:26.920 --> 30:28.400
Hm. Is everything set for tonight?

30:29.000 --> 30:31.120
Our ship will set sail after sunrise.

30:33.080 --> 30:34.040
Everything is ready.

30:34.320 --> 30:36.720
Excellent. I have to go to my room.

30:38.160 --> 30:39.840
Why is he in such a hurry?

30:40.200 --> 30:41.000
Hm.

30:41.080 --> 30:43.480
Something personal. Not of interest to us.

30:46.040 --> 30:48.160
(Echoing, suspenseful synth music begins)

31:15.000 --> 31:16.800
Yesterday was pretty slow.

31:16.960 --> 31:18.880
But now things are heating up.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.120
We've got every room wired for audio,

31:21.560 --> 31:26.360
and the suites and upper two stories
all wired for video as well,

31:26.720 --> 31:28.840
as per instructions from Berlin.

31:29.240 --> 31:31.720
Let me know
if I should be aware of anything.

31:32.320 --> 31:33.840
And no wiretap in my suite.

31:35.400 --> 31:36.840
515.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.800
And a safe backchannel to Moscow. Got it?

31:43.880 --> 31:44.760
Yes, Comrade.

31:44.840 --> 31:46.360
My God...

31:49.960 --> 31:51.960
(A droning drowns out the synth)

31:56.640 --> 31:58.120
(Beep of surveillance instruments)

32:02.840 --> 32:04.120
(He hums)

32:07.440 --> 32:08.320
Nice show.

32:09.360 --> 32:10.840
(A rushing noise)

32:10.920 --> 32:12.120
Can I help you?

32:12.560 --> 32:13.760
How rude of me.

32:13.840 --> 32:14.960
My name is Krönert.

32:15.040 --> 32:17.000
Operations Staff for Marcus Fuchs.

32:17.440 --> 32:19.360
I'll be looking over your shoulder today.

32:21.920 --> 32:23.920
(An urgent beeping)

32:26.320 --> 32:27.720
Best show in town.

32:28.240 --> 32:29.440
Better than Western TV.

32:29.960 --> 32:32.960
Local SED chiefs,
regional politicians, factory bosses.

32:33.280 --> 32:35.760
Mayor of a small town in Dresden,

32:35.840 --> 32:37.560
Party faithful, blah-blah.

32:38.080 --> 32:39.160
Now we know

32:40.320 --> 32:42.240
about his hidden SS tattoo.

32:42.400 --> 32:44.960
Whereas this guy,
a block warden from Lichtenberg,

32:45.040 --> 32:47.200
knows we've got eyes and ears on him.

32:47.720 --> 32:49.400
Turns out the lights to undress.

32:49.680 --> 32:50.840
(He laughs)

32:51.600 --> 32:53.440
Why do we need all this information?

32:55.600 --> 32:57.800
To protect the state and its citizens.

32:59.280 --> 33:01.080
-From whom?
-From themselves.

33:01.240 --> 33:02.360
Who else?

33:02.440 --> 33:04.240
(Background synth grows louder)

33:07.520 --> 33:08.440
What...

33:09.040 --> 33:11.480
(A dizzy, falling sound)

33:12.840 --> 33:14.520
Have we got audio in that room?

33:14.880 --> 33:16.440
Are you kidding me?

33:20.320 --> 33:21.800
(White noise)

33:22.520 --> 33:24.560
See you at the docks in 30 minutes.

33:34.040 --> 33:35.840
Let Sanjev know we're ready to go.

33:37.720 --> 33:38.680
I can't hear anything.

33:38.760 --> 33:40.200
I'm sure it's just dirty talk.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.800
You always think women are different.

33:42.880 --> 33:44.560
But I can tell you stories.

33:48.880 --> 33:49.800
See you later.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.400
(Modem tones)

34:04.960 --> 34:06.240
What's she doing there?

34:08.080 --> 34:09.920
Is that some kind of voodoo?

34:11.560 --> 34:12.360
Sure.

34:13.920 --> 34:15.520
(Telephone receiver clatters)

34:24.040 --> 34:25.400
What room number is this?

34:26.120 --> 34:27.280
515.

34:29.480 --> 34:30.280
Aha.

34:34.880 --> 34:35.840
Cut the feed.

34:36.080 --> 34:36.880
I'm sorry?

34:36.960 --> 34:38.960
He's our superior.
Have some respect, please.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.240
That's an order, Comrade.

34:42.840 --> 34:43.920
Cut the feed, now.

34:46.720 --> 34:48.080
(Eerie synth tones)

34:54.840 --> 34:55.960
(A driving beat sets in)

34:59.400 --> 35:02.840
ANC Safehouse, Cape Town, South Africa

35:02.920 --> 35:05.920
(Modem dialing tone)

35:11.520 --> 35:14.240
Do you have a problem with the fact

35:14.320 --> 35:15.800
that the money comes from

35:16.240 --> 35:19.680
selling weapons to the Apartheid regime
in South Africa?

35:19.760 --> 35:20.880
(Radio piano music)

35:21.040 --> 35:23.240
And that we're smuggling
West German weapons?

35:24.760 --> 35:25.840
Well...

35:26.320 --> 35:28.560
The regime will get weapons
one way or another.

35:28.640 --> 35:30.560
If we don't smuggle them,
someone else will.

35:30.760 --> 35:33.160
But then that someone else
also earns the money. Right?

35:33.680 --> 35:34.880
Yes, that's right.

35:35.080 --> 35:36.240
(Piano fades, a droning sets in)

35:37.440 --> 35:40.240
We should make the Wall greener.

35:40.320 --> 35:41.240
(Piano returns)

35:41.320 --> 35:42.200
Greener?

35:42.280 --> 35:43.240
Greener.

35:44.320 --> 35:45.520
More attractive.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.680
An architect friend said

35:48.760 --> 35:51.240
we should exchange it
for raspberry bushes.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.680
I don't know...
-It looks more peaceful,

35:55.000 --> 35:56.720
it's prettier,

35:57.040 --> 35:58.120
and...

35:58.840 --> 36:00.520
it's cheaper. Yes.

36:00.720 --> 36:01.920
(Laughter from the off)

36:06.200 --> 36:07.400
(Engaged tone)

36:08.880 --> 36:10.680
(Echo of instruments)

36:12.560 --> 36:13.560
Operator.

36:13.920 --> 36:14.720
Yes.

36:15.280 --> 36:16.360
A West German number.

36:17.520 --> 36:18.320
And this?

36:18.640 --> 36:20.160
-Exactly.
-And this?

36:20.800 --> 36:22.400
(Inhales with pleasure)

36:23.720 --> 36:24.640
Thomas Posimski.

36:25.080 --> 36:27.080
-Thomas...
-Unfortunately I'm not home.

36:27.160 --> 36:28.760
Leave a message after the beep.

36:28.960 --> 36:30.040
(Beep)

36:30.120 --> 36:31.320
Thomas, it's me.

36:31.400 --> 36:32.720
(A whoosh, a beeping)

36:35.000 --> 36:36.120
(Urgent beeping)

36:37.800 --> 36:38.760
Do it.

36:39.560 --> 36:40.760
-Yes.
-We have to...

36:41.920 --> 36:43.240
We still need to...

36:44.480 --> 36:46.560
freshen up the buildings
along Honecker's parade route.

36:47.520 --> 36:49.200
It only needs a lick of paint

36:49.800 --> 36:51.080
for the first two stories.

36:51.920 --> 36:55.200
The General Secretary
never actually leaves his car.

36:55.760 --> 36:57.440
He won't see anything above that.

36:59.400 --> 37:02.040
Does Honecker know what's going on
with our Operation Love Boat?

37:03.720 --> 37:04.600
No.

37:07.240 --> 37:08.640
It's top-secret.

37:14.360 --> 37:15.280
Yummy.

37:16.120 --> 37:16.960
(A ship's horn)

37:17.280 --> 37:20.880
Rostock Docks, East Germany

37:20.960 --> 37:22.680
(Ignition, motor noise,
suspenseful music)

37:30.120 --> 37:32.200
(Eerie tones, a dog barks)

37:32.680 --> 37:33.720
Stop!

37:34.720 --> 37:36.160
(Indistinct shouting)

37:48.160 --> 37:50.120
(Indecipherable buzz, voice-like music)

38:00.840 --> 38:01.920
Mrs. Neid?

38:03.600 --> 38:04.760
Mr. Winkelmann.

38:07.680 --> 38:09.840
Are you here to oversee
the loading personally?

38:09.920 --> 38:11.600
No, I'm here to speak with you.

38:14.600 --> 38:15.840
Already so nervous?

38:16.400 --> 38:17.720
If this thing gets out,

38:18.880 --> 38:20.080
it will ruin my career.

38:20.280 --> 38:21.480
It will ruin my life.

38:22.360 --> 38:23.880
So here's your choice.

38:24.080 --> 38:26.360
Either, I go public and blow this deal

38:26.960 --> 38:28.160
before it happens,

38:29.200 --> 38:31.320
or you give me enough money to disappear.

38:33.280 --> 38:34.080
Disappear?

38:34.320 --> 38:35.280
Yes.

38:40.240 --> 38:41.640
How much do you want?

38:43.280 --> 38:44.760
250,000 DM.

38:47.400 --> 38:48.680
250,000.

38:49.840 --> 38:50.840
In this account.

38:53.640 --> 38:55.080
By the end of the week.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.280
Or all of this
will be on the evening news.

38:58.360 --> 38:59.280
Goodbye.

39:03.680 --> 39:06.000
(Voice-like music)

39:08.560 --> 39:10.240
(Distant voices)

39:20.280 --> 39:22.200
(Industrial soundscape, voices)

39:29.320 --> 39:30.760
(English)  How is it, Kolibri?

39:33.440 --> 39:35.760
So where is Rose Seithathi?

39:36.160 --> 39:37.600
-Who?
-No, don't do that.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.600
You know who I'm talking about.
You're spymaster Martin Rauch.

39:42.560 --> 39:43.920
What do you want with her anyway?

39:44.640 --> 39:47.720
I gotta make sure that certain cargo
gets into the right hands.

39:50.200 --> 39:54.000
Okay, I got clients. They got a bit
concerned that an ANC operative

39:54.400 --> 39:57.040
is involved with a sale of arms
to the South African Defense Force.

39:57.440 --> 39:59.200
Now that's a fuck-up.

40:00.640 --> 40:02.640
How do you explain that?

40:03.840 --> 40:05.880
-Money.
-Money.

40:06.840 --> 40:09.320
When did everybody get so greedy?

40:09.720 --> 40:11.240
Right?

40:11.640 --> 40:13.640
When did everything get
so fucking complicated?

40:13.720 --> 40:14.920
Nah, it's simple.

40:15.320 --> 40:17.760
I just need to find
that black bitch Seithathi and...

40:17.840 --> 40:19.480
(A shot rings out, he falls)

40:24.680 --> 40:27.160
(Tribal-like drumming music sets in)

40:29.520 --> 40:30.360
Rose!

40:30.440 --> 40:32.120
(Vocals over drums)

40:33.000 --> 40:34.840
(Shouting voices)

40:47.880 --> 40:48.920
Rose!

40:49.000 --> 40:49.920
Rose!

40:53.280 --> 40:54.320
Rose!

40:56.360 --> 40:57.400
Rose!

40:57.960 --> 41:00.280
(Drumming ceases,
quiet keyboard takes over)

41:16.480 --> 41:17.880
West Berlin, West Germany

41:17.960 --> 41:20.800
This isn't enough
to bring the kids over here.

41:20.880 --> 41:22.200
(Sound fades to silence)

41:24.160 --> 41:25.400
(A car hoots)

41:31.480 --> 41:32.680
(A tape rewinds)

41:34.400 --> 41:37.400
Thomas, it's me.
I need you to do something for me now.

41:37.920 --> 41:39.920
Buy a platform ticket at Zoo Station.

41:40.600 --> 41:44.160
When the 6:30 p.m. from Rostock
via East Berlin arrives, board it.

41:44.760 --> 41:48.040
In the bathroom in the middle carriage,
there's a roll of film hidden.

41:48.320 --> 41:49.600
Get it to the press.

41:49.760 --> 41:52.600
Maybe you can get Steffi and Sandra
out of East Germany with it.

41:53.000 --> 41:56.360
I don't know if what you've heard
makes sense.

41:57.120 --> 41:59.360
I made a mistake
and am trying to rectify it.

41:59.640 --> 42:01.520
Can you stay in case my sister wakes up?

42:01.600 --> 42:02.560
Sure.

42:06.000 --> 42:06.960
Thank you.

42:12.360 --> 42:13.800
(A hesitant piano resounds)

42:29.000 --> 42:31.160
Yesterday, Luise was the lucky one.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.480
Today, some more of you
might get the chance to leave here.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.400
For a new home.

42:40.880 --> 42:41.720
And...

42:42.680 --> 42:43.880
new parents.

42:45.360 --> 42:48.640
Good socialist citizens
of the workers' and peasants' state.

42:50.080 --> 42:51.400
Mr. and Mrs. Keller,

42:52.000 --> 42:54.520
pick a child. Or two.

42:54.880 --> 42:56.200
Please.

42:58.760 --> 43:00.560
(Strings set in)

43:28.400 --> 43:30.440
(Melancholic piano and strings continue)

44:02.200 --> 44:03.520
(Silence)

44:09.880 --> 44:11.560
(Eerie music fades in)

45:16.720 --> 45:18.360
