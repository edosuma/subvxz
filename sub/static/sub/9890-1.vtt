08:38.366 --> 08:40.517
Bravo!

08:51.407 --> 08:53.045
Bravo!

09:44.727 --> 09:46.922
Oh, shit.

09:48.207 --> 09:50.641
Just tell me about this French girl.

09:50.847 --> 09:54.635
Is it serious or just another
one of his flings?

09:54.887 --> 09:59.483
- Did you talk to Dr. Harris yet?
- I don't need to see him, I'm fine.

09:59.647 --> 10:01.922
- Yes? Who is it?
- Listen, Anne.

10:02.087 --> 10:06.046
- Tell me when he's going to England?
- No.

10:06.887 --> 10:08.320
Yes? No. No.

10:08.487 --> 10:13.003
I'm Charles Serfiss. Could we
see Nikolai? This is my fiancÃ©e.

10:13.247 --> 10:17.160
My father is Lord Strathhammer,
and he's giving a party this evening.

10:17.407 --> 10:22.083
We're leaving early in the morning
for Japan. I'm so sorry.

10:23.527 --> 10:25.563
<i>This is the captain.</i>

10:25.807 --> 10:30.597
<i>On our left is a view of the Arctic coast</i>
<i>of the Soviet Union.</i>

10:30.847 --> 10:34.157
<i>We're experiencing</i>
<i>the Soviet white nights.</i>

10:34.367 --> 10:37.757
<i>In summertime,</i>
<i>the sun never sets on these parts.</i>

10:37.967 --> 10:40.800
<i>If you care to sleep,</i>
<i>pull down the shade.</i>

10:41.007 --> 10:44.124
Every time I leave New York,
doesn't matter how many years go by...

10:44.287 --> 10:46.403
...I just get edgy.

10:46.607 --> 10:50.805
Tokyo is our last date.
I'm glad we cancelled Sydney.

10:51.007 --> 10:54.044
Just couldn't face it.

11:04.367 --> 11:08.519
Sounds like a gypsy song.
Thank you.

11:08.767 --> 11:12.840
- What are you doing?
- Giving notes to my conductor.

11:13.047 --> 11:18.167
I'm putting music into one channel
and my notes to another.

11:19.487 --> 11:20.806
What's that?

11:21.007 --> 11:25.478
I don't know. I'm sure it's nothing.
I'll go and see.

11:38.607 --> 11:41.201
- Oh, my God!
- Some kind of short circuit.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.722
No oxygen!

11:44.647 --> 11:47.445
- The pressure's dropping.
- Could that be a leak?

11:47.607 --> 11:50.121
- Is the fire spreading?
- There's no way of knowing.

11:50.287 --> 11:53.563
- Have you found an airfield?
- There's an airfield 75 miles away.

11:53.767 --> 11:56.486
- Pressure's dropping!
- Prepare for a rapid descent.

11:56.647 --> 11:58.080
Right.

12:00.167 --> 12:03.204
- Raise the blinds.
- Excuse me, wake up.

12:04.687 --> 12:06.484
Got to get ready, sir.

12:06.687 --> 12:10.441
<i>Your attention, please.</i>
<i>This is the captain speaking.</i>

12:10.687 --> 12:14.396
<i>We have developed electrical problems</i>
<i>and will have to land.</i>

12:14.607 --> 12:18.520
<i>There's a Soviet military airfield</i>
<i>75 miles from</i> here.

12:18.767 --> 12:21.759
Where are we? Are we landing?

12:21.967 --> 12:26.199
- Where are you going?
- We're landing in Russia!

12:29.887 --> 12:32.242
- Sit down!
- Let me go!

12:32.767 --> 12:34.120
We're gonna crash!

12:34.287 --> 12:35.925
Please, sit down. Please! Please!

12:40.207 --> 12:41.845
- Tell us...
- Strap yourself in.

12:42.047 --> 12:43.924
- What's the safety height?
- 3000 feet.

12:44.087 --> 12:45.315
We'll level at four.

12:55.047 --> 12:59.677
Keep your heads down. Keep down!
We're in a rapid descent!

13:05.007 --> 13:09.762
- They won't allow us to land.
- For God's sake! We're down to 6000.

13:09.967 --> 13:14.245
If those flames find the hydraulic fluid,
we won't need any airfield.

13:25.727 --> 13:31.245
We're levelling. Into emergency drill.
Please stay in your seats!

13:31.447 --> 13:34.245
We're going to give you
emergency procedures!

13:34.407 --> 13:36.284
You will follow the lights.

13:39.167 --> 13:43.206
Will the person who spoke English
come back on? This is an emergency!

13:47.247 --> 13:51.684
- How long is this runway?
- It's too short. Decision plus 100.

13:51.847 --> 13:53.724
- We have a fire on board.
- Continuing.

13:59.927 --> 14:01.599
- Decision?
- Landing.

14:08.527 --> 14:10.165
Secure yourself! Hold on!

14:10.367 --> 14:12.358
Come on.

14:15.127 --> 14:17.516
- Stay down!
- Brakes.

14:18.487 --> 14:20.398
Don't move! Stay down!

14:26.167 --> 14:27.282
Watch out!

14:31.087 --> 14:34.159
Come on, come on.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.397
We're gonna hit them!
We're gonna hit them!

14:39.567 --> 14:41.398
You're not wrong. Hold tight!

14:44.007 --> 14:45.918
Brace yourselves!

15:02.487 --> 15:03.681
Kolya?

15:26.287 --> 15:28.005
Has my team gone
through the plane?

15:28.167 --> 15:30.522
Yes, comrade colonel.

15:31.447 --> 15:35.122
I've seen enough.

16:19.165 --> 16:21.633
It could have been a terrible tragedy.

16:21.805 --> 16:23.158
Four people were killed?

16:23.365 --> 16:26.994
Yes, there are 20 passengers
here in the clinic.

16:27.205 --> 16:29.639
Thirteen Japanese,
six British nationals...

16:29.805 --> 16:31.921
...and one with no passport.

16:32.125 --> 16:35.595
No identification of any kind.

16:35.805 --> 16:38.956
All we found was this.

16:50.085 --> 16:52.235
I have him isolated.

17:02.685 --> 17:04.915
My, my.

17:05.085 --> 17:07.804
This woman was with him.

17:13.525 --> 17:16.756
I want you to phone Moscow
immediately.

17:16.964 --> 17:18.683
Captain...

17:19.405 --> 17:21.281
...nice work.

17:21.444 --> 17:23.595
I serve the Soviet Union.

17:38.205 --> 17:42.960
Hello.
You're very lucky to be alive.

17:44.285 --> 17:47.277
Amazing anyone lived.

17:51.285 --> 17:55.278
Forgive me,
you don't speak English?

17:55.485 --> 17:56.759
I am French.

17:59.685 --> 18:01.243
Excuse me.

18:02.325 --> 18:06.796
Could I please speak
to the French ambassador?

18:07.005 --> 18:10.634
We haven't found your passport.

18:10.805 --> 18:13.035
Can the French ambassador help us?

18:13.365 --> 18:15.083
Yes. Of course.

18:17.485 --> 18:23.355
Wouldn't it be simpler
to call American Embassy?

18:23.565 --> 18:28.241
Or have you recently defected
from America to France?

18:31.685 --> 18:35.280
I've seen you dance, Rodchenko.

18:39.325 --> 18:41.475
Welcome home, Nikolai.

18:44.965 --> 18:48.355
- Can I have a cigarette?
- Of course.

18:58.005 --> 19:01.964
Please feel at home.

19:06.605 --> 19:08.914
I refuse to speak
anything but English.

19:09.125 --> 19:12.674
Please inform the embassy I am here.
I am an American citizen.

19:12.925 --> 19:16.361
What you call yourself
is no concern to us.

19:16.565 --> 19:19.682
Here you're just a criminal.

19:19.885 --> 19:21.876
The world will demand
that you hand me over.

19:22.045 --> 19:23.842
The world.

19:24.005 --> 19:29.762
What an ego. The world is overjoyed
that we allowed the plane to land.

19:29.965 --> 19:33.401
We saved hundreds of lives.
Only four people died.

19:33.685 --> 19:39.078
- Who? What were their names?
- Don't worry, don't worry.

19:39.765 --> 19:45.283
Your promoter was not hurt.

19:47.205 --> 19:51.915
I sent her home
along with the others.

19:52.125 --> 19:55.117
I'll explain your condition to her.

19:55.325 --> 19:57.964
My condition? What condition?

20:00.525 --> 20:05.724
- I demand that you let me out of here!
- You demand, Rodchenko?

20:07.845 --> 20:13.522
I always admired you as a dancer.
Our great dancer.

20:16.405 --> 20:19.283
But what a pathetic man.

20:39.525 --> 20:43.677
In a few hours,
you'll be flown to Moscow.

20:45.525 --> 20:49.916
Seven passengers released
from the clinic will go with you.

20:50.125 --> 20:52.685
What about the others?

20:55.365 --> 20:56.957
There are 13 other passengers...

20:57.165 --> 21:01.875
I want to know
the condition of my friend.

21:05.805 --> 21:09.195
The name of your friend? Please.

21:09.965 --> 21:15.562
- Nikolai Rodchenko.
- Yes, I'm his manager.

21:16.965 --> 21:19.354
Your friend was seriously injured.

21:19.565 --> 21:23.717
- Yes, I know.
- They're not sure he'll recover.

21:23.965 --> 21:27.162
- I'm so sorry.
- I must see him.

21:27.365 --> 21:31.438
He's very ill. They're having
a specialist brought in.

21:31.645 --> 21:34.557
- I won't leave without seeing him.
- Talk to your embassy.

21:34.725 --> 21:40.083
Oh, I will. You can't let...
You can't leave.

21:42.285 --> 21:45.322
So Moscow approved your plan?

21:45.525 --> 21:49.074
- Is it night?
- Yes.

21:49.605 --> 21:53.120
These white nights
would drive me crazy.

22:07.405 --> 22:09.760
<i>Raymond! Raymond! Raymond!</i>

22:09.965 --> 22:13.640
<i>Raymond! Raymond! Raymond!</i>

22:18.725 --> 22:23.719
Sister, that Porgy ain't gonna be
no witness now.

22:23.925 --> 22:27.315
- They gonna lock him up in jail.
- Lock him up?

22:27.565 --> 22:33.515
Ain't nobody home now but Bess
and old Sportin' Life...

22:33.965 --> 22:38.641
...giving you the stuff for scare
away them lonesome blues.

22:38.805 --> 22:40.318
Happy dust!

22:40.485 --> 22:43.477
I ain't want none of that stuff.
Take that stuff away, buzzard.

22:43.725 --> 22:49.641
And remember, there's plenty more
where that came from.

22:49.845 --> 22:52.234
Listen.

26:19.325 --> 26:23.113
- Show-off American bastard.
- Tamara, calm down.

26:32.045 --> 26:34.605
Hey, pretty baby.
What's your name?

26:34.765 --> 26:37.723
I'm not that kind of girl.
I won't tell you.

26:37.965 --> 26:40.354
You won't tell me, huh?

26:40.525 --> 26:42.402
No, I won't.

26:43.325 --> 26:46.920
Then I'll kiss it out of you.

26:54.365 --> 26:56.401
You were very good, Raymond.

26:56.645 --> 26:59.762
- Colonel Chaiko.
- Long time, no see.

26:59.965 --> 27:03.435
- What are you doing here?
- Business.

27:04.165 --> 27:08.317
Great play, isn't it?
So much ahead of its time.

27:08.565 --> 27:11.955
Very neglected in America, I'm told.

27:13.165 --> 27:16.840
<i>Raymond, Raymond, Raymond!</i>

27:17.045 --> 27:19.559
- They really like you.
- Thanks.

27:20.285 --> 27:23.914
We wanna do <i>West Side Story</i> next.

27:24.445 --> 27:26.720
I saw it in New York.

27:26.925 --> 27:32.716
The original cast. Years ago.
Marvellous. Marvellous.

27:32.965 --> 27:37.516
A very accurate picture
of the race conflict in America.

27:38.365 --> 27:41.198
You should perform it in Moscow.

27:41.445 --> 27:44.562
You should come back to Moscow,
both of you.

27:44.805 --> 27:49.083
- Maybe something can be worked out.
- That'd be great.

27:50.565 --> 27:53.875
Standing out there tonight,
watching you...

27:54.085 --> 27:57.680
...and I remember
when you first got here.

27:58.685 --> 28:03.076
How scared you were
at that first press conference.

28:05.565 --> 28:10.275
Your beautiful interpreter
was already at your side.

28:12.765 --> 28:16.883
I think I have to take a lot of credit
for bringing you together.

28:18.605 --> 28:21.915
Funny, the way things turn out.

28:24.725 --> 28:29.435
I remember when you said, "I don't
know how to say it," and I said:

28:30.845 --> 28:33.723
Say what is in your heart.

28:37.685 --> 28:40.961
People were so moved
by your heroism.

28:41.165 --> 28:43.918
I'll never forget that day.

28:45.165 --> 28:48.840
- Long time ago.
- Seems like yesterday.

28:50.285 --> 28:54.517
- I couldn't get in touch with you...
- I was so busy.

28:54.765 --> 28:58.724
But when I learned that I'm going
to be in this godforsaken area...

28:58.885 --> 29:00.443
...I just had to see you.

29:00.965 --> 29:06.676
There's something you can do for me.
I'll wait outside.

29:12.085 --> 29:16.556
- He's waiting outside for us.
- What is he doing here?

29:16.765 --> 29:19.962
Why are you talking to him?
I don't want him in our lives again.

29:20.165 --> 29:23.475
Didn't you hear?
He can help us get back home.

29:23.645 --> 29:27.524
- He's helped us enough already.
- Don't worry about this now.

29:27.685 --> 29:29.755
Everything's gonna be all right.

29:33.925 --> 29:40.364
"Raymond, your beautiful interpreter
was already standing by your side."

29:48.725 --> 29:53.753
There's a large haematoma here.
Evidence of a concussion.

29:53.965 --> 29:57.082
What's your opinion, Art?

29:57.285 --> 30:02.359
It would be an idiot risk to move him.
He could well be in a coma.

30:02.605 --> 30:07.918
How do we know these are his?
You must insist they release him to us.

30:08.125 --> 30:13.279
There's not a chance. I tried.
That is a highly secret military base.

30:13.565 --> 30:18.002
- I'm surprised they let the plane land.
- He's an American citizen!

30:18.245 --> 30:22.238
Not to the Soviets.
By their rules, he's a criminal.

30:22.445 --> 30:27.599
Eight years ago he was tried in
absentia and sentenced to 15 years.

30:27.765 --> 30:32.316
We have to appeal to the U.N.,
I'll schedule a press conference.

30:32.565 --> 30:36.763
No! Right now they're taking credit
for saving 250 lives.

30:36.925 --> 30:39.997
- Oh, please.
- Soviet PR has never been better.

30:40.165 --> 30:42.633
- Larry!
- He's an embarrassment to them.

30:42.845 --> 30:45.359
They're asking us
to keep a low profile.

30:45.525 --> 30:47.880
You're gonna let them
get away with this?

30:48.205 --> 30:53.325
Anne, go back to New York. The State
Department will keep you informed.

30:54.445 --> 30:58.074
I am not leaving this country
without Kolya.

31:39.594 --> 31:41.471
Where am I?

31:41.874 --> 31:43.227
Taimyr.

31:46.194 --> 31:48.185
Oh, hi, you're up.

31:49.634 --> 31:53.422
Hi, Raymond Greenwood, New York.
Nice to meet you.

31:53.674 --> 31:56.142
I asked to call American Embassy...

31:56.314 --> 31:58.066
I'm not from the embassy.

32:00.034 --> 32:04.949
- But you're an American citizen, yeah?
- I'm American.

32:05.154 --> 32:10.626
That's my wife, Darya. We'll look
after you till you get on your feet.

32:11.594 --> 32:14.950
I am on my feet, I'd like to go home.

32:16.914 --> 32:22.466
You got shaken up in that crash.
You ought to be glad you're alive.

32:22.674 --> 32:24.153
I am glad.

32:30.514 --> 32:34.223
- I suppose she's from New York too?
- I am from Moscow.

32:34.434 --> 32:39.110
- We work in the theatre here.
- Yeah, I'm a tap dancer.

32:40.954 --> 32:43.104
Tap dancer?

32:43.794 --> 32:45.147
Yeah.

32:46.274 --> 32:51.428
Of course. You're from New York,
she's from Moscow.

32:51.634 --> 32:55.183
And you live here, in Siberia.

32:56.714 --> 32:59.308
- It's only temporarily.
- Of course.

32:59.514 --> 33:02.108
Nobody's here permanently.

33:03.954 --> 33:05.023
Am I under arrest?

33:05.274 --> 33:09.552
No, no, you're not under arrest.
You're free as a bird.

33:11.074 --> 33:15.511
- And you're not my guard?
- No, I told you, I'm a tap dancer.

33:19.554 --> 33:23.388
- I can go and get some fresh air?
- Sure. I'll go with you.

33:23.674 --> 33:25.744
What if I wanna go alone?

33:27.954 --> 33:29.307
Go ahead.

33:31.754 --> 33:33.506
It's cold out.

33:59.234 --> 34:00.428
Shit!

34:45.634 --> 34:46.953
Bitch!

34:49.353 --> 34:51.708
I thought I was free as a bird.

34:51.954 --> 34:55.833
Just hanging out with another dancer.
A tap dancer, right?

34:56.034 --> 34:58.832
I don't like people calling
long-distance.

34:59.074 --> 35:04.387
You and your wife are paid informers.
Stool pigeons. Lowest of the low.

35:04.554 --> 35:08.547
- Watch your mouth.
- Lf they tell you to, you'll kill me.

35:08.754 --> 35:12.383
- Anything to survive.
- You're a real American paranoid.

35:12.634 --> 35:18.106
I think they want me back here. How do
they feel about you back in New York?

35:18.314 --> 35:19.986
Shut up!

35:57.354 --> 36:02.189
- Had enough?
- Yeah, the herring was just great.

36:02.434 --> 36:04.265
I'm so glad.

36:05.834 --> 36:07.506
Asshole.

36:09.794 --> 36:13.389
Has your life in Russia always
been like this? Like in a storybook?

36:13.634 --> 36:18.947
No, I think it's only your life
that has been like a storybook.

36:19.154 --> 36:22.510
You're not as tall
as I thought you'd be.

36:22.794 --> 36:25.547
Don't drink if it'll make you
bigger pain in the ass.

36:25.794 --> 36:29.867
We're in Russia. In Russia,
we open a bottle, we drink it.

36:30.074 --> 36:32.793
- You can leave it in the bottle.
- Come on, drink up.

36:33.394 --> 36:38.946
- You used to be Russian.
- I'm still Russian. I'm just not Soviet.

36:40.394 --> 36:42.749
You're <i>amerikanetz</i> now, I forgot.

36:42.994 --> 36:46.509
That's right, I am.
Are you Soviet citizen now?

36:50.154 --> 36:53.942
<i>Amerikanetz,</i> that's just fabulous.

36:54.834 --> 36:58.509
- It's a wonderful country.
- What do you know about it?

36:58.754 --> 37:03.874
You ever been to Harlem? Like, on your
way to an airport? Ever look inside?

37:04.074 --> 37:06.110
Ever dance at the Apollo?

37:07.394 --> 37:11.103
You go on your tippy-toes
to the White House.

37:11.554 --> 37:13.112
Tell me...

37:15.794 --> 37:18.308
...why did you come here?

37:21.794 --> 37:27.312
I'm surprised you never heard of me.
I was in the headlines for a while.

37:27.554 --> 37:32.548
I was a big star.
Not as a tap dancer, of course.

37:32.794 --> 37:34.307
You're a defector.

37:37.314 --> 37:41.193
I'm a selector, not a defector.

37:43.594 --> 37:45.710
You got fed up with freedom?

37:46.754 --> 37:51.111
Or you thought that audiences in
Siberia are better public for your work?

37:52.114 --> 37:53.832
Clever.

37:55.474 --> 37:56.953
Very clever.

38:01.354 --> 38:05.711
- You know the funny thing about me?
- I can't imagine.

38:06.514 --> 38:09.312
I used to feel the way you do
about America.

38:10.594 --> 38:12.505
I was a patriot.

38:14.874 --> 38:18.787
The greatest country in the world.
I was also a tap dancer...

38:18.994 --> 38:24.114
...which, for a black person,
is not that unusual.

38:24.914 --> 38:29.112
I don't know if you know this, Nik...
Mind if I call you Nik?

38:31.634 --> 38:35.229
Most black people in America
can tap.

38:35.474 --> 38:37.510
I don't know, it's just a thing.

38:37.674 --> 38:40.063
You're born, you're black,
you can tap.

38:46.474 --> 38:50.149
Don't get me wrong, I love to dance.
Love to dance.

38:50.354 --> 38:53.312
And I got work. I was cute.

38:54.154 --> 38:58.830
Cute little coloured kid.
They called us coloured in those days.

38:59.074 --> 39:02.703
A cute little coloured kid,
tapping away.

39:05.674 --> 39:08.984
Oh, I was a real novelty. Yeah.

39:09.154 --> 39:13.306
Of course, by the time I grew up,
it was a different story.

39:13.514 --> 39:17.666
"He's an adult black man now.
He's not so cute. Give him a broom."

39:17.874 --> 39:19.592
Raymond!

39:19.874 --> 39:24.026
The rich don't patronize tap, Nik.

39:26.314 --> 39:28.111
So I'm 18.

39:29.994 --> 39:31.746
I can't get a job.

39:32.514 --> 39:34.948
I cannot get a gig.

39:39.034 --> 39:40.990
My mother says:

39:41.234 --> 39:45.830
"Raymond, don't worry.
This is your year.

39:50.674 --> 39:55.509
Something good's coming.
Something good."

39:58.314 --> 39:59.952
She was right.

40:02.034 --> 40:04.946
She was right.
Somebody did want me.

40:06.514 --> 40:08.505
Uncle Sam.

40:08.994 --> 40:12.145
And right!

40:13.954 --> 40:17.310
Yeah, Uncle Sam wanted me,
wanted the whole ghetto.

40:17.554 --> 40:21.308
He said,
"I want all y'all! Get on in here!"

40:22.594 --> 40:26.109
I said, "Wow, this is it.
I'm gonna get myself a real career.

40:26.354 --> 40:31.223
I'll get involved in electronics.
Become a communications expert.

40:34.554 --> 40:38.911
Defend my country against
communism. Where are they?"

40:46.994 --> 40:48.871
But when they made me the offer...

40:49.034 --> 40:51.946
...nobody said,
"You're gonna become a murderer.

40:53.634 --> 40:57.104
You're gonna become a rapist.

40:58.394 --> 41:02.512
You're gonna maim and rob people."

41:04.034 --> 41:09.108
I kept saying to myself, "This war
has gotta be about something.

41:09.314 --> 41:14.752
We can't just be hired killers. No,
it's not possible. We're Americans."

41:18.754 --> 41:23.828
A little voice in my head said,
"Ray, you're being used.

41:24.034 --> 41:26.707
They're trying to kill you.

41:29.154 --> 41:32.464
They don't even think you're human,
and they want you die for them.

41:32.634 --> 41:34.511
Make them richer."

41:42.634 --> 41:45.706
It was all very clear.

41:59.354 --> 42:00.753
Now I remember you.

42:00.994 --> 42:05.943
Sure, I was big news
while they needed me.

42:07.674 --> 42:12.111
- It's still a better place than this.
- Don't talk that shit to me, man.

42:12.354 --> 42:17.189
I know about America.
I know what makes it tick.

42:17.434 --> 42:20.312
You don't fool me for a second.

42:21.394 --> 42:23.112
You're no hero.

42:25.474 --> 42:28.750
You just made a run
to where it pays better.

42:32.194 --> 42:35.106
I can't remember. I can't.

42:36.834 --> 42:39.302
I think I'm going crazy.

42:43.154 --> 42:44.951
What am I doing?

43:05.304 --> 43:07.738
Did you tell him he would
be given the opportunity...

43:07.904 --> 43:11.021
...to live the life he had before?

43:11.304 --> 43:14.262
No. I mean...

43:14.504 --> 43:15.983
Why not?

43:16.824 --> 43:21.420
He's had a big shock. Plane crash.
Lot of bad luck.

43:21.664 --> 43:24.337
- Yes?
- I don't wanna blow it.

43:32.304 --> 43:33.976
Get out.

43:35.024 --> 43:36.776
Please.

43:53.584 --> 43:56.701
What did you mean last night, huh?

43:56.944 --> 44:00.334
You were "hot news"
while we needed you.

44:02.664 --> 44:07.374
You mustn't think you're being used.

44:07.624 --> 44:13.893
This country gave you a shelter,
an education, a forum for your views.

44:14.104 --> 44:19.417
I was drunk. The guy's a pain
in the ass. He's driving us nuts.

44:20.264 --> 44:24.337
- He's a prima donna, isn't he?
- Yeah, he's a big star.

44:24.544 --> 44:27.934
You can't say,
"You gotta dance here, or else."

44:28.144 --> 44:30.533
It's not that kind of atmosphere.

44:40.624 --> 44:45.061
A man gets old before his time
in places like this.

44:47.424 --> 44:49.540
Look at them.

44:51.744 --> 44:56.135
Modern man is so confused,
Raymond.

44:56.344 --> 45:01.976
But finally, it's better to work
in a theatre than in a mine.

45:29.504 --> 45:32.018
Raymond, are you all right?

45:32.184 --> 45:34.015
- Yeah, yeah.
- What did he want?

45:34.224 --> 45:37.455
He wanted to chat.
He keeps tabs on people.

45:37.744 --> 45:40.212
No, what did he say to you?

45:40.464 --> 45:43.342
"Modern man is so confused."

45:43.584 --> 45:48.055
I'm sorry about last night.
It got a little out of hand.

45:48.304 --> 45:51.580
Everyone drinks too much here.
It helps.

45:52.424 --> 45:57.134
I'll never be able to look another
bottle of vodka in the eye again.

45:57.344 --> 46:00.142
- Want some coffee?
- Yeah.

46:01.024 --> 46:04.858
I am sorry about last night.
I just... I got embarrassed.

46:05.064 --> 46:08.943
A big star like you having
to stay in a dump like this.

46:09.144 --> 46:11.214
I know it's not what you're used to.

46:13.304 --> 46:15.772
Anyway, you're home now.

46:16.944 --> 46:20.141
I guess you consider that
a lot of bad luck.

46:23.624 --> 46:26.343
Unluckiest guy in the world, right?

46:28.744 --> 46:33.534
But on the bright side,
everybody here is so glad you're back.

46:34.224 --> 46:36.135
Who's everybody?

46:37.384 --> 46:40.979
Well, you were so popular
when you were here.

46:41.224 --> 46:45.775
It would be fabulous for everybody
concerned if you danced again.

46:46.424 --> 46:48.142
People would love it.

46:49.144 --> 46:53.342
- People?
- The people and the higher-ups too.

46:54.704 --> 46:59.175
Is this an official proposition,
or just your advice to me...

46:59.424 --> 47:02.177
...comrade to comrade?

47:03.504 --> 47:08.339
Your situation here would improve a
thousand percent if you danced again.

47:08.584 --> 47:10.654
My situation?

47:11.464 --> 47:13.216
Why don't you just go lie down.

47:13.464 --> 47:17.616
You're here now. Face it.
Make the best of it.

47:18.464 --> 47:23.538
- Here in Siberia?
- Well, not here. Russia.

47:25.184 --> 47:28.494
- They'd bend over backwards for you.
- They would?

47:32.184 --> 47:35.142
They'd let you have
your old life back again.

47:35.344 --> 47:40.293
- My old life.
- The whole thing. They'd be delighted.

47:40.864 --> 47:42.297
Well...

47:43.304 --> 47:47.695
...l'd have to make sure
the offer was sincere.

47:47.944 --> 47:49.821
It's no problem.

47:50.024 --> 47:52.140
I'd have to go to Leningrad...

47:52.384 --> 47:56.775
...see what sort of situation
they're talking about.

47:57.584 --> 47:59.142
It's a piece of cake.

48:39.144 --> 48:43.854
- How does it feel to be back?
- What do you want me to say?

48:45.104 --> 48:47.140
Oh, these are yours.

48:50.984 --> 48:53.976
Your luggage is in the boot.

48:54.984 --> 48:58.340
Amazing what they were able
to recover.

49:02.744 --> 49:07.943
The Kirov Ballet, where Pavlova,
Nijinsky, Balanchine were taught.

49:08.144 --> 49:13.138
Oh, yes, Nikolai Rodchenko
shouldn't be forgotten.

49:13.384 --> 49:16.774
All of them dance here in the Kirov.

49:17.024 --> 49:21.620
- And all of them left here.
- A new season opens in 10 days.

49:21.904 --> 49:26.819
Your appearance on opening night will
be a great moment in dance history.

49:26.984 --> 49:28.337
I'm sure of it.

49:30.024 --> 49:31.742
I'd see.

49:38.224 --> 49:42.820
Actually, it's a terrible embarrassment
to us, you being back here.

49:43.024 --> 49:45.936
There were many
well-publicized defections.

49:46.104 --> 49:49.494
Yours was the worst.

49:52.384 --> 49:55.933
However, we have not thrown you
in prison, have we?

49:56.584 --> 49:59.257
Everyone wants you to know
that our offer is sincere.

49:59.784 --> 50:02.537
No one will hold your
past mistakes against you.

50:02.784 --> 50:04.103
Everyone?

50:19.024 --> 50:20.616
Hello, Pasha.

50:23.224 --> 50:24.498
How is your mother?

50:24.664 --> 50:26.859
She died four years ago.

50:27.904 --> 50:29.462
I'm very sorry.

50:31.944 --> 50:35.983
- This is where you lived, huh?
- Eight years ago.

51:01.184 --> 51:02.981
It's just the same.

51:03.784 --> 51:06.981
It was kept just as you left it.

51:07.664 --> 51:10.940
I wouldn't moan
about coming back here.

51:17.104 --> 51:21.859
You can see how sincere the offer is.
You have everything you need.

51:22.104 --> 51:26.461
A rehearsal studio,
a car at your disposal.

51:26.704 --> 51:28.934
Food, drinks, anything.

51:31.224 --> 51:33.784
Raymond, look.

51:35.264 --> 51:38.939
Raymond, tomorrow you start
at the dance studio.

51:39.144 --> 51:43.217
Six hours a day.
I need him on his toes.

51:43.464 --> 51:46.103
- I'm a tap dancer...
- That's your problem.

51:48.264 --> 51:50.858
This is the place for you, Kolya.

51:51.064 --> 51:55.057
Your history is here. Your culture.

51:55.304 --> 51:59.183
If you return, you will be respected
as a cultural hero.

51:59.424 --> 52:05.135
In America, what are you really?
A curiosity.

52:05.384 --> 52:07.818
A momentary fad.

52:08.984 --> 52:13.341
In a few more years,
you'll be a has-been there.

52:15.344 --> 52:17.983
Think it over.

52:21.864 --> 52:23.536
Bastards.

52:32.704 --> 52:34.535
Damn it!

52:41.944 --> 52:47.143
I wish we could lose ourselves here.
Just you and I.

52:48.224 --> 52:52.740
- With no one watching us.
- Everything's gonna be all right.

52:54.864 --> 52:57.458
I wish we could just disappear.

52:57.624 --> 52:59.854
Things are gonna get better
for us here.

53:00.024 --> 53:02.936
Your friends should hide
their mikes better.

53:47.614 --> 53:49.730
So, what about it?

53:50.134 --> 53:53.206
They want you to be fit.
You gotta work out.

53:53.454 --> 53:55.524
Please forgive me.

53:55.974 --> 54:00.331
For some mysterious reason,
I don't feel like dancing.

54:01.214 --> 54:03.887
That kind of attitude
won't get you anywhere.

54:04.094 --> 54:05.971
Attitude?

54:06.374 --> 54:09.525
You've learned to play the game,
haven't you?

54:11.054 --> 54:14.888
No one's gonna hold a gun
to your head, but if I were you...

54:15.094 --> 54:19.087
No, no gun. How smug you are.

54:19.254 --> 54:25.284
If I dance, you and your wife crawl up
the ladder. You see the difference?

54:25.494 --> 54:31.330
I dance when I feel like it,
you only dance when you're drunk.

54:31.774 --> 54:37.167
- Shut up and work out.
- You want me to dance? I'll dance.

54:37.334 --> 54:43.330
A little ballet? A little ballet.
A classical ballet. Coming up.

54:55.614 --> 54:58.367
How about that?
That's what they want?

54:58.574 --> 55:00.610
Very funny.

55:01.174 --> 55:03.893
- This is good stuff. Who is it?
- Good, huh?

55:04.134 --> 55:06.364
Maybe you should plug your ears.

55:06.614 --> 55:10.926
It's dangerous stuff, don't enjoy it.
People might be watching.

55:11.414 --> 55:13.848
Okay, I'll dance for you.
You want a tap?

55:14.054 --> 55:17.285
You couldn't tap to save your life.

55:17.494 --> 55:20.930
Save my life? Freudian slip?

55:34.374 --> 55:37.013
Okay, okay, enough playing around.

55:37.254 --> 55:40.644
Let's get to serious business.
Some serious ballet?

55:40.854 --> 55:42.412
It's about time.

55:42.654 --> 55:44.610
- How much money you got?
- Why?

55:44.854 --> 55:46.173
How much money?

55:47.334 --> 55:50.963
- I got about 10 rubles.
- Okay. Watch.

55:52.214 --> 55:58.608
One pirouette, 1 ruble. Two
pirouettes, 2 rubles. And on and on.

55:59.214 --> 56:03.127
- You a betting man?
- What do I get if you lose?

56:03.534 --> 56:07.049
Good question.
They took my money. My watch?

56:11.694 --> 56:15.448
- You're a black-marketeer as well.
- That's right.

56:15.654 --> 56:19.408
Okay, 7 rubles
against my tape recorder.

56:19.694 --> 56:23.243
No, no, no. I got 10 rubles.

56:23.414 --> 56:25.882
- I want 10 pirouettes for it.
- Be serious.

56:26.294 --> 56:29.252
- I'm very serious.
- This isn't ice-skating rink. Impossible.

56:29.454 --> 56:33.208
Ten rubles, 10 pirouettes.

56:34.294 --> 56:37.127
You're a betting man. Wait a minute.

56:38.934 --> 56:40.845
Eleven rubles.

56:41.534 --> 56:44.651
Eleven pirouettes.

56:46.814 --> 56:48.566
Eleven rubles?

56:51.414 --> 56:53.644
Okay.

57:00.654 --> 57:03.452
- Can you count?
- Yeah, don't worry. Just spin.

57:16.374 --> 57:19.013
Eleven pirouettes...

57:19.254 --> 57:21.324
...11 rubles.

57:23.294 --> 57:24.647
Rubles.

57:25.654 --> 57:28.771
Sweet, sweet rubles.

57:31.654 --> 57:33.326
You're right.

57:34.054 --> 57:37.524
This music feels good!

57:38.334 --> 57:43.727
Rubles! You know,
I forgot how small they are.

58:10.814 --> 58:12.930
Very impressive.

58:13.094 --> 58:14.846
My God, it's you.

58:16.134 --> 58:17.726
Turn it off.

58:17.974 --> 58:19.248
Please.

58:24.614 --> 58:28.687
Galina lvanova.
Raymond Greenwood.

58:29.214 --> 58:32.047
Would you please wait outside?

58:33.654 --> 58:36.771
Yeah. I'll wait outside.

59:07.614 --> 59:11.527
Galina. How many years?

59:11.694 --> 59:13.366
Eight.

59:15.334 --> 59:17.006
How's your life?

59:17.174 --> 59:19.369
I'm very well, thank you.

59:23.054 --> 59:25.284
I heard you were married.

59:25.454 --> 59:26.603
Not anymore.

59:29.054 --> 59:30.373
You look wonderful.

59:31.574 --> 59:32.848
I'm older.

59:34.734 --> 59:37.726
But why are we speaking Russian?

59:38.334 --> 59:40.973
You're no longer Russian, are you?

59:42.694 --> 59:45.527
I thought I'd never see you again.

59:45.774 --> 59:48.732
Did it make it easier for you, Kolya?

59:48.974 --> 59:51.852
- Easier to forget?
- No, harder.

59:52.054 --> 59:56.286
- You bastard!
- I had to go. I had to do it.

59:56.494 --> 59:59.327
- It wasn't right to say anything to you...
- "Right"?

59:59.934 --> 01:00:02.732
You knew what was right?

01:00:03.294 --> 01:00:05.808
I was choking here, you knew it.

01:00:06.014 --> 01:00:09.609
I came back from London
and defended myself to the KGB.

01:00:09.814 --> 01:00:14.205
They didn't believe you stayed
in the West without word to me.

01:00:15.334 --> 01:00:18.132
I couldn't believe it myself.

01:00:18.934 --> 01:00:20.572
I'm sorry.

01:00:21.734 --> 01:00:25.852
They took away my passport. For
four years, I was not allowed to travel.

01:00:28.094 --> 01:00:33.646
And for three years, I was taken
every week to answer their questions.

01:00:33.854 --> 01:00:37.051
Every week,
the same stupid questions!

01:00:37.214 --> 01:00:38.886
You answered well.

01:00:39.094 --> 01:00:41.289
You are an important person
at the theatre.

01:00:41.454 --> 01:00:45.003
Powerful, just as you always wanted.

01:00:45.214 --> 01:00:48.411
I heard you're driving a Mercedes.

01:00:48.614 --> 01:00:53.130
And what do you drive
in America, Nikolai? A donkey?

01:00:56.374 --> 01:01:01.732
I was supposed to give up everything
so that you could live in Disneyland?

01:01:10.534 --> 01:01:12.013
Well...

01:01:12.574 --> 01:01:15.725
...l'm sure you know why I'm here.

01:01:19.734 --> 01:01:22.612
I want to offer you
a place at the Kirov.

01:01:22.814 --> 01:01:28.332
It's a very generous offer,
one you're not in a position to refuse.

01:01:29.334 --> 01:01:33.168
What are you saying?
You know what would happen.

01:01:33.374 --> 01:01:38.129
I cannot play their games anymore.
I'll be finished.

01:01:38.894 --> 01:01:40.327
Don't exaggerate.

01:01:41.574 --> 01:01:46.125
Get word to the West that I'm well
and they're keeping me here.

01:01:47.254 --> 01:01:49.563
Why should I risk anything for you?

01:01:49.814 --> 01:01:55.969
You see foreigners at the theatre.
Just tell one that I am here.

01:01:56.614 --> 01:02:00.766
You haven't changed. You're just
as selfish as you always were.

01:02:00.934 --> 01:02:04.973
You've never thought about anyone
in your life but yourself.

01:02:05.174 --> 01:02:09.406
I didn't want to leave you.
I was in love with you.

01:02:09.574 --> 01:02:12.964
Oh, you'll say anything
to get me to help you, won't you?

01:02:13.334 --> 01:02:15.802
I've never lied to you.

01:02:16.214 --> 01:02:19.206
- Help me!
- No.

01:02:33.894 --> 01:02:35.885
A lady from the past?

01:02:36.094 --> 01:02:38.528
She was a great dancer.

01:02:39.534 --> 01:02:42.332
I'm not talking about her feet.

01:02:43.654 --> 01:02:46.532
I hurt some people when I left.

01:02:46.974 --> 01:02:48.532
Didn't you?

01:02:49.934 --> 01:02:51.526
It happens.

01:02:52.854 --> 01:02:57.166
I'd like to take a shower,
a long one. Do you mind?

01:02:57.374 --> 01:02:59.330
No, go ahead.

01:03:30.414 --> 01:03:32.132
Was he receptive to the offer?

01:03:32.294 --> 01:03:34.444
I'm sure he'll consider it.

01:03:35.414 --> 01:03:38.645
Did you do your best
to convince him?

01:03:38.814 --> 01:03:41.851
Yes, of course, Vladimir lvanovich.

01:03:42.014 --> 01:03:46.610
I hope you were persuasive.

01:03:51.174 --> 01:03:53.529
If he dances at the gala...

01:03:53.694 --> 01:03:57.573
...what position will he be
given at the theatre?

01:03:59.214 --> 01:04:02.012
I suppose he would dance
the opening night...

01:04:02.174 --> 01:04:05.484
...but I don't think he'd be available
for the current season.

01:04:05.814 --> 01:04:09.807
He'd have to take time off
for a long debriefing.

01:04:10.414 --> 01:04:15.283
But ultimately,
it's a political decision.

01:07:12.614 --> 01:07:15.287
Hello, kids.

01:07:16.654 --> 01:07:19.214
- Who's your teacher?
- Semionov.

01:07:19.614 --> 01:07:22.492
Semionov, we're old friends.

01:07:22.654 --> 01:07:24.804
Give him this note, please?

01:07:24.974 --> 01:07:26.726
No. We are rehearsing here.

01:07:28.614 --> 01:07:30.445
I am Nikolai Rodchenko.

01:07:30.614 --> 01:07:34.084
I studied here too.
I danced with lvanova.

01:07:34.254 --> 01:07:35.653
Liar.

01:07:35.814 --> 01:07:38.089
No, I am not.
I am Nikolai Rodchenko.

01:07:38.294 --> 01:07:43.163
You're lying. We know everyone
who has danced with lvanova.

01:07:46.894 --> 01:07:51.046
You've never heard
of Nikolai Rodchenko?

01:07:51.254 --> 01:07:55.691
- He's crazy.
- Of course, how would you know?

01:08:07.414 --> 01:08:09.564
- Get out!
- I'm going, little one.

01:08:09.734 --> 01:08:11.770
Pervert!

01:08:12.214 --> 01:08:13.886
Little shit.

01:09:42.254 --> 01:09:44.006
Nice music, isn't it?

01:09:45.413 --> 01:09:46.926
Yeah.

01:09:49.014 --> 01:09:52.211
It's much more
rhythmically complicated...

01:09:52.413 --> 01:09:54.530
Don't you miss all that?

01:09:59.894 --> 01:10:01.930
Yeah, sometimes.

01:10:04.494 --> 01:10:08.123
- But there's nothing there for me now.
- Bullshit.

01:10:12.414 --> 01:10:17.204
- I'd be arrested if I went back there.
- It's a different era now.

01:10:17.414 --> 01:10:20.053
Things have changed.

01:10:20.254 --> 01:10:24.645
You don't know shit, man.
You don't know.

01:10:29.454 --> 01:10:33.129
My father won't even say
my name anymore.

01:10:34.134 --> 01:10:39.208
My brother's ashamed of me.
My brother's ashamed of me.

01:10:41.214 --> 01:10:43.774
My mother got sick.

01:10:44.374 --> 01:10:46.524
I tried to call.

01:10:47.894 --> 01:10:50.124
I wanted her to hear my voice...

01:10:50.294 --> 01:10:55.049
...and try to explain to her
why I did this.

01:10:57.454 --> 01:10:59.968
Nobody would take the call.

01:11:02.214 --> 01:11:04.774
They say I killed her.

01:11:06.814 --> 01:11:09.009
I can't go back.

01:11:23.359 --> 01:11:27.352
Mr. Greenwood,
the KGB is giving us a feast.

01:11:27.999 --> 01:11:32.151
Let's enjoy it.
The chair of honour, right there.

01:11:35.919 --> 01:11:40.435
- It's the best rubles can buy.
- They're really trying to impress you.

01:11:40.719 --> 01:11:45.554
Don't kid yourself. You know
how elite live in this country?

01:11:48.079 --> 01:11:51.708
Any pleasure, any perversion.
Name it.

01:11:51.919 --> 01:11:55.594
They're as decadent here
as in New York, Tokyo or Rome.

01:11:55.919 --> 01:11:58.308
They just keep it all hidden.

01:11:59.559 --> 01:12:01.629
There's a lot you don't know.

01:12:01.879 --> 01:12:06.270
But tonight, I want to try
some of this decadence.

01:12:06.479 --> 01:12:09.596
- Since you know so much about it.
- Be my guest.

01:12:09.799 --> 01:12:12.518
- Start with the caviar.
- Caviar!

01:12:13.399 --> 01:12:14.718
That's so good.

01:12:15.039 --> 01:12:17.428
Now I need something else.
You know?

01:12:18.479 --> 01:12:19.798
Vodka.

01:12:20.039 --> 01:12:22.348
- You want some?
- Absolutely.

01:12:22.559 --> 01:12:25.437
- Raymond, come on!
- Thank you.

01:12:26.319 --> 01:12:30.471
Come on, blood!
Let's get down to the food.

01:12:30.679 --> 01:12:33.830
- Blood?
- You know what I'm trying to say?

01:12:34.159 --> 01:12:37.469
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, folks, welcome to my house.

01:12:40.439 --> 01:12:42.953
It's good to see you smiling.

01:12:43.919 --> 01:12:45.272
Get out!

01:12:46.519 --> 01:12:49.238
You, go, pack quickly! One bag!

01:12:49.439 --> 01:12:51.191
- She's going away.
- No!

01:12:51.559 --> 01:12:54.471
You let Rodchenko talk
to a group of students.

01:12:54.639 --> 01:12:55.958
Don't argue!

01:12:56.159 --> 01:12:58.673
Now you'll see what happens
when you lie to me.

01:12:58.839 --> 01:13:00.591
What students?
I don't know anything.

01:13:00.759 --> 01:13:05.355
From the time you came here,
I treated you as an intelligent man.

01:13:05.559 --> 01:13:07.709
I show you respect,
but now, no more.

01:13:07.879 --> 01:13:10.188
What's happening here?
What are you doing?

01:13:10.359 --> 01:13:12.350
What are you doing?
Wait a minute!

01:13:12.519 --> 01:13:15.716
You helped him to betray us again!

01:13:15.879 --> 01:13:18.109
Leave him alone!
Don't argue with them.

01:13:18.279 --> 01:13:20.998
Don't do this!
He's just a goddamn dancer!

01:13:21.159 --> 01:13:24.356
Yes, I agree.
Not worth her life, is he?

01:13:28.039 --> 01:13:30.234
Take her downstairs.

01:13:31.119 --> 01:13:32.996
Lock them in the apartment.

01:13:33.159 --> 01:13:35.912
- What's happening?
- None of your business.

01:13:51.239 --> 01:13:55.869
- What's the hell's he talking about?
- The window in the shower.

01:13:56.079 --> 01:13:59.196
I crawled out. I'm sorry.

01:13:59.999 --> 01:14:04.595
You crawl... You son of a bitch!
You're sorry?

01:14:04.799 --> 01:14:09.589
That woman is the best thing that ever
happened to me! And you're sorry?

01:14:09.839 --> 01:14:13.434
You're sorry, Nik? You know
what that was? That was half!

01:14:13.599 --> 01:14:17.148
That was half! I promised
I'd never use that against anybody.

01:14:17.359 --> 01:14:20.590
But if something happens to my wife,
I'm gonna kill you!

01:14:23.119 --> 01:14:25.235
- Tonight, this is what her life is.
- No.

01:14:25.559 --> 01:14:27.151
- You did it to her.
- No.

01:14:27.359 --> 01:14:30.317
Don't blame it on me.
Face it, you did it to her.

01:14:31.999 --> 01:14:34.433
You can't deny it.

01:14:47.879 --> 01:14:51.997
Stop it. It's okay. It's okay.

01:14:52.159 --> 01:14:53.717
Sit down.

01:14:53.879 --> 01:14:55.471
Sit down.

01:15:08.199 --> 01:15:11.475
Now I'll talk to you.
I've got no choice.

01:15:11.679 --> 01:15:13.749
I've got to trust you.

01:15:44.879 --> 01:15:47.029
I'm so glad you came.

01:15:47.239 --> 01:15:51.357
- Nothing much has changed, huh?
- No.

01:15:51.799 --> 01:15:55.872
- Do you still listen to Vysotsky?
- Yes, of course.

01:15:56.119 --> 01:15:59.350
But he's an outlaw. He's unofficial.

01:15:59.559 --> 01:16:03.029
Vysotsky's songs
can't be sung in the theatre.

01:16:05.839 --> 01:16:10.867
But we have made progress. Look,
these are for an evening of Balanchine.

01:16:13.399 --> 01:16:16.675
I very much hope
that you'll dance at it.

01:16:16.879 --> 01:16:19.712
We were talking about
this evening 10 years ago.

01:16:20.639 --> 01:16:23.107
Nothing ever comes of it.

01:16:23.359 --> 01:16:25.077
It's a dream.

01:16:26.879 --> 01:16:32.158
- The Ministry of Culture assures me...
- They will consider the possibility?

01:16:36.279 --> 01:16:41.307
I remember.
I did it. I danced Balanchine.

01:16:41.519 --> 01:16:44.272
You're still waiting.

01:16:48.279 --> 01:16:52.909
Your position in this theatre will be
as important as when you left.

01:16:53.119 --> 01:16:56.555
You know what I've done since then.

01:16:57.639 --> 01:17:02.588
Has any other theatre in the world
been like this for you, Kolya?

01:17:02.799 --> 01:17:05.359
Or any other audience?

01:17:06.519 --> 01:17:10.637
- The Kirov.
- It's beautiful.

01:17:10.879 --> 01:17:12.597
Yes.

01:17:12.839 --> 01:17:15.433
You were to be a legend here.

01:17:15.719 --> 01:17:19.394
Now the young ones
don't even know your name.

01:17:19.599 --> 01:17:22.352
How does that feel?

01:17:22.559 --> 01:17:27.633
How does it feel? I was born
as a dancer in this theatre.

01:17:27.839 --> 01:17:31.309
It will always be a part of me,
like Russia.

01:17:31.519 --> 01:17:34.955
But for eight years, I've been free.

01:17:35.159 --> 01:17:39.550
Do you know what it means
to be really free? Do you?

01:17:39.799 --> 01:17:43.075
No, it's like Vysotsky.
You whisper his songs.

01:17:43.279 --> 01:17:46.635
I won't whisper what I feel.

01:17:49.239 --> 01:17:52.834
I want to scream like he does!

01:17:53.879 --> 01:17:57.076
I can't lie anymore! Look at me.

01:17:58.679 --> 01:18:01.068
Look at me!

01:19:44.919 --> 01:19:48.150
You are working for Chaiko,
aren't you?

01:19:50.759 --> 01:19:52.192
Yes.

01:19:54.519 --> 01:19:55.998
I'm sorry.

01:19:58.079 --> 01:20:00.957
- He made me.
- "He made me."

01:20:02.039 --> 01:20:05.998
Galina, you used to hate him
as much as me.

01:20:06.199 --> 01:20:09.077
You ran away, I had to face them.

01:20:14.319 --> 01:20:18.358
Yes, I was selfish. I still am.

01:20:19.679 --> 01:20:22.876
I'm not a hero, I'm just a dancer.

01:20:23.079 --> 01:20:26.867
It's all I can do.
It's what I live for.

01:20:27.359 --> 01:20:31.272
But they will never let me dance
for myself here.

01:20:31.479 --> 01:20:33.435
No matter what they say.

01:20:35.479 --> 01:20:38.755
I can't start all over again.

01:20:39.719 --> 01:20:43.348
I can't risk everything
that I've fought for.

01:20:46.039 --> 01:20:47.916
I understand.

01:20:57.679 --> 01:21:01.467
Oh, Kolya, I'm too frightened.

01:21:03.959 --> 01:21:06.154
It's all right.

01:21:06.479 --> 01:21:08.754
It's all right.

01:21:20.559 --> 01:21:24.313
I won't let them destroy you.

01:21:27.359 --> 01:21:30.431
How can I?

01:21:54.319 --> 01:21:56.958
- Mr. Scott!
- Hello, colonel. How are you?

01:21:57.119 --> 01:21:58.916
I'm fine.

01:21:59.079 --> 01:22:02.230
- Have you met Miss lvanova?
- No. No.

01:22:02.439 --> 01:22:05.636
It really is a very great pleasure
to meet you.

01:22:07.639 --> 01:22:09.789
Wynn Scott,
from the American Embassy.

01:22:09.959 --> 01:22:12.268
- Watch out, Galina, he's a spy.
- No, no.

01:22:12.479 --> 01:22:15.198
Now you're exaggerating, colonel.
I'm not a spy.

01:22:15.519 --> 01:22:19.273
Today, the slang expression
is "spook."

01:22:19.439 --> 01:22:23.591
No. We don't like that word.
We're real sensitive about it.

01:22:23.879 --> 01:22:28.953
Mr. Scott worked in Iran before he
came here. Before that, in Saigon.

01:22:29.119 --> 01:22:32.031
- Oh, really?
- He makes it sound worse than it is.

01:22:32.199 --> 01:22:34.110
- Excuse me. Very nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

01:22:34.279 --> 01:22:38.033
Rodchenko is awake
here in Leningrad.

01:22:39.759 --> 01:22:43.035
I still have contacts with
the Minneapolis Art Center.

01:22:43.239 --> 01:22:46.515
There's so much interest
in ballet back there.

01:22:46.719 --> 01:22:50.917
- Lf they wanted to get in touch...
- Ploschad Mira Bazaar, Friday at 11.

01:22:51.119 --> 01:22:53.952
Well, I'll have them write you there.
Thank you so very much.

01:22:54.119 --> 01:22:56.110
My God, Minneapolis.

01:22:56.319 --> 01:22:58.787
These Americans are
really hopeless.

01:22:58.959 --> 01:23:00.233
Fools.

01:23:10.239 --> 01:23:14.357
- Who is this Galina lvanova?
- They were lovers before he left.

01:23:14.559 --> 01:23:16.834
You call Washington,
I'll call <i>The New York Times.</i>

01:23:16.999 --> 01:23:22.027
Wait a minute, I talked to Washington.
We can't move until we get proof.

01:23:22.239 --> 01:23:25.754
- We've got proof! She saw him.
- But she was with Chaiko!

01:23:25.919 --> 01:23:28.513
It's a plan, I know it.
He's trying to manipulate us.

01:23:28.679 --> 01:23:33.469
Stop this cloak-and-dagger bullshit.
He's there, I can feel it.

01:23:33.679 --> 01:23:37.274
This guy, Chaiko,
has put together something fantastic.

01:23:37.479 --> 01:23:41.916
He's got witnesses to the fact that
Rodchenko was injured, including you.

01:23:42.279 --> 01:23:45.669
He supplied x-rays and they look
alarming. What do we have?

01:23:45.879 --> 01:23:50.316
The word of a ballerina,
a jilted girlfriend. Forget it.

01:23:50.519 --> 01:23:54.034
Who asked you? I can focus
world opinion, and I will.

01:23:54.239 --> 01:23:57.151
Let me play devil's
advocate and tell you:

01:23:57.359 --> 01:24:02.911
If you jeopardize their position, they
might just try to protect themselves.

01:24:03.119 --> 01:24:06.031
They could fly him to Siberia,
give him an overdose of drugs...

01:24:06.199 --> 01:24:08.633
...and say he died of his injuries.

01:24:08.839 --> 01:24:10.477
Oh, my God.

01:24:11.399 --> 01:24:13.071
Jerri.

01:24:13.399 --> 01:24:17.631
I don't want you to kid yourself
about the press conference.

01:24:17.839 --> 01:24:21.718
That sort of thing
just doesn't fly over here.

01:24:21.919 --> 01:24:27.994
Anne, get yourself a cup of tea.
It's gonna be a long day.

01:24:28.199 --> 01:24:33.910
- Please, this man is very special.
- I'll do all I can.

01:24:35.199 --> 01:24:37.030
Believe me.

01:24:41.279 --> 01:24:46.148
- I wanna get this rat-fucker Chaiko!
- Got any ideas?

01:24:47.359 --> 01:24:53.514
I'm going back to Leningrad. You may
have to join me there in a few days.

01:24:53.719 --> 01:24:59.635
We might even be able to use her,
and her international press contacts.

01:25:18.109 --> 01:25:21.226
Come on, get off your ass!

01:25:21.469 --> 01:25:26.224
You're supposed to be my shadow,
aren't you? Let's see you move.

01:25:26.429 --> 01:25:29.102
I'm not your servant
or your babysitter.

01:25:29.509 --> 01:25:34.299
Brings up an interesting point.
What exactly are you?

01:25:34.549 --> 01:25:37.188
- Fuck you.
- Let's go.

01:25:37.389 --> 01:25:41.428
Where's that famous natural rhythm?
Did you lose it in Siberia?

01:25:41.629 --> 01:25:44.701
Here it is. You see this?

01:28:49.349 --> 01:28:51.943
Good morning, young lady.

01:28:52.149 --> 01:28:56.939
- Buy some flowers?
- No, I'm waiting for someone.

01:29:08.349 --> 01:29:13.582
Come on, darling,
potatoes from Estonia.

01:29:13.749 --> 01:29:17.822
- Not very fresh.
- Look, you can eat it raw, first quality.

01:29:17.989 --> 01:29:18.978
Not today.

01:29:19.389 --> 01:29:21.744
Where are they hiding him?
It's okay to talk.

01:29:21.909 --> 01:29:24.059
I'm from the embassy. Scott sent me.

01:29:24.269 --> 01:29:27.818
Just tell me quickly and quietly,
where are they keeping him?

01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:30.668
- Don't walk away from me.
- You are boring me.

01:29:30.909 --> 01:29:36.063
I'm not a fool. I could see how you
looked at Darya. You better watch it.

01:29:36.269 --> 01:29:39.067
You've done a great job
taking care of your wife.

01:29:39.269 --> 01:29:40.907
- Look, you asshole...
- Raymond!

01:29:41.069 --> 01:29:43.537
Why don't you go take a shower.

01:29:43.789 --> 01:29:45.700
No problem.

01:29:47.469 --> 01:29:51.508
- Better think about what I said.
- I will.

01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:58.709
God, he's an asshole.

01:29:59.789 --> 01:30:02.098
Why did you want to talk to me?

01:30:02.589 --> 01:30:04.944
Look, I can't take it anymore.

01:30:05.149 --> 01:30:09.222
How do you expect me to feel,
being locked up with that?

01:30:09.469 --> 01:30:14.497
He's scum.
Something out of the sewer.

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:17.303
- I found it repulsive.
- What's that?

01:30:17.549 --> 01:30:19.460
How she could have married him.

01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:24.301
- Who?
- The wife. Darya.

01:30:25.829 --> 01:30:30.345
You know, some women.
Shock value.

01:30:31.029 --> 01:30:35.659
She was very young.
And you know what they say about...

01:30:37.109 --> 01:30:39.304
...black studs.

01:30:39.709 --> 01:30:44.339
To see an extraordinary woman
like her tied into this...

01:30:44.549 --> 01:30:48.588
...I can't look at it.
She could have any man she wanted.

01:30:48.829 --> 01:30:51.821
You should have seen her
when she was younger.

01:30:55.269 --> 01:30:59.103
It's fine for one night,
as a curiosity or cheap thrill.

01:30:59.309 --> 01:31:03.427
But how could she have married that?
I can't believe it.

01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:08.743
I don't know. I find it myself
completely unappetizing.

01:31:10.709 --> 01:31:15.703
- You fancy her, don't you?
- No, I'm simply amazed.

01:31:16.149 --> 01:31:19.459
- Lf you're truly interested...
- She regrets it. I can feel it.

01:31:19.629 --> 01:31:20.982
She really does.

01:31:21.269 --> 01:31:24.102
She's wasting herself on this...

01:31:24.989 --> 01:31:26.707
Nigger?

01:31:49.869 --> 01:31:51.461
Raymond.

01:31:53.189 --> 01:31:56.067
- Dasha.
- Chaiko let me go. He just let me go.

01:31:56.229 --> 01:31:58.504
I'm so sorry.

01:31:58.749 --> 01:32:00.865
I'm all right.

01:32:01.069 --> 01:32:04.141
- Really, I'm all right.
- You're all right?

01:32:04.389 --> 01:32:07.506
- Don't worry.
- Oh, baby.

01:32:10.829 --> 01:32:12.740
Come on.

01:32:31.779 --> 01:32:35.897
Living like this,
we're like rats in a cage.

01:32:36.139 --> 01:32:38.448
- When he took you away...
- It doesn't matter.

01:32:38.619 --> 01:32:44.012
It does matter.
We can't live like this, Dasha.

01:32:46.019 --> 01:32:50.774
- Lf it wasn't for me...
- I was gonna be one of them.

01:32:50.979 --> 01:32:56.975
Silent, numb. I couldn't have been
any happier than I am with you.

01:32:59.059 --> 01:33:02.768
I'm nothing. I failed at everything.

01:33:02.979 --> 01:33:05.209
- I didn't get you back. Nik did.
- Listen to me.

01:33:05.379 --> 01:33:07.893
- Pretended he was into you.
- None of this matters.

01:33:08.059 --> 01:33:10.414
- I learned to ignore...
- You can't ignore them all...

01:33:10.579 --> 01:33:13.252
Raymond! I'm pregnant.

01:33:15.019 --> 01:33:17.328
We're going to have a baby.

01:33:19.379 --> 01:33:20.971
Yeah?

01:33:22.659 --> 01:33:24.456
Oh, Dasha.

01:33:25.459 --> 01:33:29.577
I don't care what happens.
They can't imprison me anymore.

01:33:29.779 --> 01:33:34.933
I feel so strong.
I feel I could fly over the city.

01:34:24.979 --> 01:34:28.813
I can't tell anymore whether
it's morning or nighttime.

01:34:29.019 --> 01:34:31.408
It's 4 in the morning.

01:34:31.619 --> 01:34:34.577
You didn't sleep?

01:34:37.859 --> 01:34:39.497
Thanks.

01:34:39.699 --> 01:34:41.655
For what?

01:34:42.299 --> 01:34:44.529
For getting her back.

01:34:44.739 --> 01:34:47.333
He fell for the racist bit.

01:34:48.299 --> 01:34:51.609
Yeah, you did it.

01:34:51.819 --> 01:34:55.937
Now you have to make up
your mind. I'm going.

01:34:56.139 --> 01:34:58.607
Whether you help me or not.

01:34:59.979 --> 01:35:02.174
I won't turn you in.

01:35:04.259 --> 01:35:07.057
But are you sure
you can trust lvanova?

01:35:10.179 --> 01:35:13.455
- Then we're going with you.
- Don't be crazy.

01:35:13.659 --> 01:35:17.208
I'm willing to risk my life. I won't
take responsibility for both of you.

01:35:17.659 --> 01:35:23.017
You need us to get out of this building.
Either count us in, or forget it.

01:35:23.219 --> 01:35:25.858
- But you told me...
- She's pregnant.

01:35:31.619 --> 01:35:34.179
First thing in a long time
that's given me some hope.

01:35:34.979 --> 01:35:37.618
Know what Chaiko will do
if you're caught?

01:35:37.819 --> 01:35:40.333
You're taking the risk, aren't you?

01:35:41.579 --> 01:35:43.968
They almost destroyed me.

01:35:44.179 --> 01:35:47.694
I'm not gonna give them a chance
to do that to my kid.

01:35:47.899 --> 01:35:52.927
- And Darya agreed?
- No, she doesn't know yet.

01:35:53.139 --> 01:35:55.653
She won't want to go.

01:35:57.059 --> 01:36:02.691
Whether it's one or three, the odds
are against making it. Think about it.

01:36:05.979 --> 01:36:11.099
After midnight's the best time.
These two get into a chess match.

01:36:11.299 --> 01:36:15.008
- They play for hours every night.
- I've watched them too.

01:36:15.219 --> 01:36:20.134
I'm pretty sure they're the only ones
watching the building.

01:36:36.059 --> 01:36:38.448
Give me a break.
We're not gonna try that again.

01:36:38.619 --> 01:36:41.292
<i>- You're never gonna learn this.</i>
<i>- I need the exercise.</i>

01:36:41.459 --> 01:36:44.292
<i>And besides,</i>
<i>your primitive steps amuse</i> me.

01:36:44.499 --> 01:36:47.616
<i>- Come on, teacher.</i>
<i>- This is the last time I'm doing it.</i>

01:36:48.299 --> 01:36:51.371
Let's show him
how effective you've been.

01:39:11.899 --> 01:39:13.890
Tonight.

01:39:24.579 --> 01:39:29.812
Remember when you said you wished
we could just disappear? Fly away?

01:39:30.019 --> 01:39:31.577
Yes.

01:39:32.539 --> 01:39:37.738
Why don't we do it. Just go.
Take control of our own lives.

01:39:37.939 --> 01:39:41.295
- Be serious.
- I'm very serious.

01:39:45.019 --> 01:39:51.094
I feel this baby growing inside you.
I feel very strong and clear.

01:39:51.299 --> 01:39:56.532
- We gotta leave here, Dasha.
- Be quiet! It's impossible.

01:40:02.979 --> 01:40:05.254
Nik's going tonight,
and we're going with him.

01:40:05.419 --> 01:40:07.614
- Are you crazy? It will be suicide.
- Listen.

01:40:07.779 --> 01:40:10.009
- We belong here.
- Listen to me.

01:40:10.219 --> 01:40:13.689
It's a chance for the baby
to have a real life, be free.

01:40:13.899 --> 01:40:15.617
We can't ask a child to grow up here.

01:40:15.779 --> 01:40:18.976
You always talk about freedom.
You never ask me what I want.

01:40:19.179 --> 01:40:23.934
- I'll choose what I will do.
- The baby will make it worse for us.

01:40:24.099 --> 01:40:29.048
- They'll never leave us alone.
- This is my home! I'm Russian!

01:40:29.219 --> 01:40:32.689
- Things will change.
- Change? Our lives are worthless.

01:40:32.859 --> 01:40:36.374
- How dare you insult our lives.
- I'm no good to my kid in a labour camp.

01:40:36.579 --> 01:40:38.456
Stop it!

01:40:44.299 --> 01:40:48.087
If we can make it to the consulate,
we'll be safe.

01:40:48.299 --> 01:40:51.814
Kolya put pressure on
the State Department to get us out.

01:40:52.619 --> 01:40:55.179
Please. It's dangerous.

01:40:56.099 --> 01:40:59.569
I'm gonna do something right
this time.

01:41:02.539 --> 01:41:04.291
Raymond, I love you.

01:41:11.179 --> 01:41:12.532
Let's get this straight.

01:41:12.699 --> 01:41:17.136
If I dance here again,
I'll dance only what I choose.

01:41:17.979 --> 01:41:20.049
How dare you come in here like this.

01:41:20.259 --> 01:41:25.174
You certainly won't be choosing
what I dance, and with whom.

01:41:25.379 --> 01:41:27.176
Your ego is really incredible.

01:41:27.619 --> 01:41:32.090
You're stuck here, face it.
And you'll dance, like it or not.

01:41:32.299 --> 01:41:36.008
If you're clever,
you will not alienate me.

01:41:48.259 --> 01:41:50.409
That's better.

01:41:52.739 --> 01:41:58.177
Look. This is a tape of you
when you first came to Leningrad.

01:42:01.219 --> 01:42:07.010
- See how young you were?
- It was 20 years ago.

01:42:07.939 --> 01:42:09.338
Yes.

01:42:14.579 --> 01:42:21.018
But now you're back here
where you belong. Accept it.

01:42:24.339 --> 01:42:26.978
If you can cross Griboyedov Canal
by midnight...

01:42:27.179 --> 01:42:30.569
...there will be an American diplomat
waiting for you at the Lion Bridge.

01:42:30.739 --> 01:42:32.297
His name is Scott.

01:42:32.499 --> 01:42:38.256
- He will drive you to the consulate.
- Thank you, my love.

01:42:38.459 --> 01:42:43.852
Tell me, if I had asked you
to come with me the first time...

01:42:44.139 --> 01:42:46.414
...would you have come?

01:42:48.579 --> 01:42:50.809
Probably not.

01:42:51.659 --> 01:42:56.255
- I wish you could come with me now.
- You know I can't.

01:42:57.659 --> 01:43:03.131
- My place is here.
- I'll never see you again.

01:43:05.219 --> 01:43:07.653
Don't forget me.

01:43:14.699 --> 01:43:18.931
- I'll always love you.
- Go now, please. Go fast.

01:43:27.139 --> 01:43:28.970
Go.

01:46:03.074 --> 01:46:05.349
We're getting rid of
your friends tomorrow.

01:46:11.434 --> 01:46:14.585
- Well?
- We're going.

01:46:27.434 --> 01:46:30.870
Cut the shit!
I know what you're up to.

01:46:31.114 --> 01:46:34.311
I'm so tired of your vulgarity.

01:46:35.074 --> 01:46:38.066
- Leave her alone.
- She's my wife!

01:46:39.434 --> 01:46:42.312
- Is that the law of the jungle?
- You asshole.

01:46:42.874 --> 01:46:46.787
- Will you please stop it!
- Yeah, I'll stop it.

01:46:47.074 --> 01:46:48.587
Listen.

01:46:49.114 --> 01:46:51.582
I want you out of our lives,
right now!

01:46:51.834 --> 01:46:56.191
- You'll get your wish soon enough.
- Stop. Calm down.

01:46:56.394 --> 01:46:59.784
Calm down? You see what
this little shit is trying to do?

01:46:59.994 --> 01:47:04.385
All I have to do is tell Chaiko
I want you out of here tonight...

01:47:05.074 --> 01:47:06.553
...and you're gone.

01:47:09.114 --> 01:47:10.706
You arrogant little punk!

01:47:10.914 --> 01:47:14.623
<i>You just did it for the money.</i>
<i>That's why you defected. Admit it!</i>

01:47:14.834 --> 01:47:15.983
Turn around.

01:47:16.154 --> 01:47:18.827
- What's the matter?
- Just do as you're told.

01:47:21.274 --> 01:47:22.832
You heard him.

01:47:33.914 --> 01:47:36.553
If I were you, I wouldn't
piss Chaiko off anymore.

01:47:37.074 --> 01:47:39.144
Look who's buddy-buddy
with Chaiko now.

01:47:39.314 --> 01:47:41.509
Raymond, please, leave him alone.

01:47:41.714 --> 01:47:46.185
He's scared. A little pressure
and he loses his backbone.

01:47:47.674 --> 01:47:53.067
No more Mr. Tough Guy talk, huh?
Just begging to dance here now.

01:47:53.274 --> 01:47:58.553
I've listened to enough of your insults.
Either go in your room and shut up...

01:47:59.074 --> 01:48:01.793
...or I'm calling Chaiko now!

01:48:02.034 --> 01:48:06.186
- Go ahead and call him.
- He's right. Let's go to our room.

01:48:06.434 --> 01:48:10.586
- We're out of here tomorrow.
- You're right about that one.

01:48:24.594 --> 01:48:27.631
Raymond, come on!
Let's go to the room.

01:48:27.874 --> 01:48:30.024
I'll be there in a minute.

01:48:32.074 --> 01:48:33.746
<i>I'm sorry for losing my temper.</i>

01:48:33.914 --> 01:48:36.382
<i>Yeah? It's a little late for apologies.</i>

01:48:36.834 --> 01:48:40.144
<i>Don't make this any harder</i>
<i>than it already is.</i>

01:48:40.634 --> 01:48:44.263
<i>- Have you set your mind on staying?</i>
<i>- Do I have a choice?</i>

01:48:44.474 --> 01:48:49.502
<i>- So, what happens to me and Darya?</i>
<i>- You've done your job. Stool pigeon.</i>

01:48:53.914 --> 01:48:57.190
<i>I don't care about you,</i>
<i>but I feel sorry for her.</i>

01:48:57.434 --> 01:49:00.949
<i>You can't stand it, can you?</i>
<i>That she loves</i> me.

01:49:01.154 --> 01:49:04.590
<i>- It disturbs your racist consciousness.</i>
<i>- Bullshit!</i>

01:49:05.154 --> 01:49:06.667
Good luck.

01:49:06.834 --> 01:49:11.146
The proletariat has nothing to lose
but its spare change.

01:50:10.834 --> 01:50:12.586
Hurry up.

01:50:47.114 --> 01:50:48.103
Come on.

01:50:49.994 --> 01:50:51.268
Come on, little more.

01:51:28.714 --> 01:51:30.705
Well, colonel, now what?

01:51:31.674 --> 01:51:34.234
I want to go up to
the monitoring room.

01:51:34.394 --> 01:51:37.192
Come on. Let's move.

01:51:39.114 --> 01:51:43.107
- The door's locked.
- Get the landlady down, stupid!

01:51:54.234 --> 01:51:55.349
Hey!

01:51:57.554 --> 01:51:59.351
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:52:02.314 --> 01:52:04.032
No.

01:52:09.874 --> 01:52:11.944
<i>I love you.</i>

01:52:13.394 --> 01:52:15.430
- Where is he going?
- I don't know. Let's go.

01:52:15.594 --> 01:52:17.949
- Where is he going?
- Let's go.

01:52:19.594 --> 01:52:25.191
<i>If it weren't for what they'd do to me</i>
<i>and my wife, I'd break your neck.</i>

01:52:33.114 --> 01:52:37.949
- It took you long enough.
- You should have come in the front.

01:52:38.114 --> 01:52:40.708
- Is everything okay?
- Of course.

01:52:40.874 --> 01:52:42.751
All decent people are asleep.

01:52:42.914 --> 01:52:45.064
I want to hear
what's going on up there.

01:52:58.874 --> 01:53:02.389
Damn it!
They're blocking the side entrance.

01:53:04.074 --> 01:53:06.383
- Through the lobby.
- I won't go without Raymond!

01:53:06.554 --> 01:53:09.432
- We've gone too far.
- I don't care.

01:53:09.594 --> 01:53:14.384
Raymond's only chance is for us
to make it to the consulate.

01:53:16.314 --> 01:53:18.305
- Get back!
- Let me go.

01:53:18.514 --> 01:53:20.186
Chaiko!

01:53:20.994 --> 01:53:25.112
- What's happening up there?
- I've got to talk to you now!

01:53:25.754 --> 01:53:28.063
Let him come.
Quickly, the transcripts.

01:53:33.034 --> 01:53:35.025
- How recent?
- Half-hour ago.

01:53:35.194 --> 01:53:36.627
Keep inside.

01:53:38.514 --> 01:53:42.063
I'm not gonna have my dick cut off
for that little shit! I'll kill him!

01:53:42.274 --> 01:53:45.311
Calm down or I'll have you subdued!

01:53:52.274 --> 01:53:56.187
I'm sorry. I apologize.

01:53:57.874 --> 01:54:00.832
- Come inside. I want to talk to you.
- I'm sorry.

01:54:01.074 --> 01:54:03.713
Sorry. I lost my head.

01:54:14.354 --> 01:54:16.788
You want to talk?
I'll tell you something too.

01:54:17.034 --> 01:54:20.390
He's leaving in a couple of days
anyway, right?

01:54:21.074 --> 01:54:22.632
Come and have a drink.

01:54:29.234 --> 01:54:31.065
Now, Raymond.

01:54:32.834 --> 01:54:35.428
- What is it?
- Get him out of our lives.

01:54:35.674 --> 01:54:38.268
- Are you ordering me now?
- She's my wife!

01:54:38.434 --> 01:54:43.428
You gotta get him away from my wife!
You're a man, you should understand!

01:54:53.274 --> 01:54:57.790
<i>- I'm sorry for losing my temper.</i>
<i>- It's a little late for apologies.</i>

01:54:58.074 --> 01:55:00.668
<i>Don't make this any harder</i>
<i>than it already is.</i>

01:55:01.674 --> 01:55:03.426
Let me listen.

01:55:03.634 --> 01:55:06.831
<i>You can't stand it, can you?</i>
<i>That she loves</i> me.

01:55:07.034 --> 01:55:10.424
<i>- It disturbs your racist consciousness.</i>
<i>- Bullshit!</i>

01:55:11.234 --> 01:55:14.146
- Is this a recording?
- No. It's live.

01:55:15.194 --> 01:55:20.143
Don't try to out-drink a Russian.
It's in our blood.

01:55:33.754 --> 01:55:35.028
What is it?

01:55:35.234 --> 01:55:36.747
You should hear something.

01:55:39.034 --> 01:55:41.104
- Later.
- But, Colonel Chaiko...

01:55:41.274 --> 01:55:45.108
Captain Kirigin,
can't you see I'm busy?

01:55:54.514 --> 01:55:56.470
As you wish.

01:55:57.794 --> 01:55:58.783
Later.

01:56:56.834 --> 01:56:58.313
Stop.

01:57:00.034 --> 01:57:01.308
Be careful.

01:57:07.874 --> 01:57:08.943
Come on.

01:57:12.634 --> 01:57:14.545
- He should be on the other side.
- Who?

01:57:14.714 --> 01:57:17.547
I don't know.
Somebody named Scott.

01:57:46.914 --> 01:57:49.792
Wynn Scott.
We should leave your friend here.

01:57:50.034 --> 01:57:51.865
- She's going with us!
- I'm going back.

01:57:52.034 --> 01:57:54.229
You know what would happen
to you and your baby?

01:57:54.474 --> 01:57:57.386
This is meaningless unless
we can get back to the consulate.

01:57:57.554 --> 01:57:59.112
Let's go.

01:58:06.394 --> 01:58:09.227
You know, Raymond,
your wife is Russian.

01:58:09.474 --> 01:58:11.942
She has a mind of her own.

01:58:12.194 --> 01:58:15.186
You have to give her
a chance to think.

01:58:15.674 --> 01:58:16.948
Another.

01:58:17.634 --> 01:58:19.590
It's finished.

01:58:20.034 --> 01:58:21.945
Let's open up another bottle.

01:58:22.274 --> 01:58:24.230
You've had enough.

01:58:27.634 --> 01:58:29.386
You set this all up, didn't you?

01:58:29.634 --> 01:58:34.424
Trying to get him to fall for my wife.
Get him in my bed.

01:58:34.674 --> 01:58:37.234
Now I can listen. Get up!

01:58:37.474 --> 01:58:40.625
I won't listen to anything
you put together.

01:58:40.874 --> 01:58:43.832
Come on. Sit down,
have another drink.

01:58:44.114 --> 01:58:45.832
Get up!

01:58:49.594 --> 01:58:52.870
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
I don't want to hear it!

01:58:53.114 --> 01:58:55.389
Come on back inside.

01:59:02.514 --> 01:59:03.993
You black bastard.

01:59:04.194 --> 01:59:07.072
Son of a bitch! You're too late!

01:59:07.874 --> 01:59:08.943
Too late, motherfucker!

01:59:09.394 --> 01:59:10.747
Everybody downstairs. Now!

01:59:10.914 --> 01:59:12.108
I tried to tell you.

01:59:13.634 --> 01:59:15.431
Call out the militia.

01:59:15.594 --> 01:59:17.744
Cover all western consulates!

01:59:38.464 --> 01:59:42.343
- Can you drive faster?
- We don't want to blow it by speeding.

01:59:42.584 --> 01:59:45.178
- Take it easy. It's not far.
- Just try to relax.

01:59:52.304 --> 01:59:55.216
Are you hungry? There's a party
at the consulate tonight.

01:59:55.384 --> 01:59:57.261
A lot of Third World diplomats.

01:59:57.504 --> 02:00:01.702
Every one of them
a non-aligned, unbiased witness.

02:00:01.944 --> 02:00:04.333
Chaiko can't call them
American liars.

02:00:18.144 --> 02:00:21.022
- Could you hurry?
- Hang on, it's not far.

02:00:21.184 --> 02:00:22.776
We're getting closer all the time.

02:00:26.264 --> 02:00:28.824
- Straight or by the church?
- Go right, it's faster.

02:00:33.664 --> 02:00:36.622
- There it is.
- Inside those gates, you're home free!

02:00:36.824 --> 02:00:39.941
- Fantastic!
- I told you we'd make it.

02:00:40.504 --> 02:00:41.653
Look out!

02:00:45.664 --> 02:00:48.303
Traffic boys, not KGB.

02:00:48.704 --> 02:00:49.739
Get out of the car.

02:00:51.184 --> 02:00:53.140
Try to be seen.

02:00:53.744 --> 02:00:56.656
I'm from the American consulate,
with diplomatic immunity.

02:00:56.824 --> 02:00:58.257
These people are with me.

02:01:00.544 --> 02:01:02.341
- That's only Scott's car!
- No, it's him.

02:01:02.504 --> 02:01:04.972
The car's too far away to tell.

02:01:05.224 --> 02:01:07.021
You can't go outside those gates!

02:01:07.224 --> 02:01:08.896
We've got to be sure it's him.

02:01:09.384 --> 02:01:11.944
Ladies and gentlemen,
come right ahead.

02:01:12.104 --> 02:01:14.095
- Come on, everybody!
- Come right ahead.

02:01:18.584 --> 02:01:19.573
Damn it!

02:01:19.784 --> 02:01:20.978
Block the entrance.

02:01:21.184 --> 02:01:23.254
Get that one! Shoot that one!

02:01:23.464 --> 02:01:24.783
Nice try, Mr. Scott.

02:01:24.984 --> 02:01:27.020
We've got cameras, colonel.

02:01:27.224 --> 02:01:29.419
- Too far.
- Not with a telephoto.

02:01:29.624 --> 02:01:33.822
A 200 mm will get a nice close-up
from there.

02:01:34.264 --> 02:01:38.303
Those are Third World diplomats.
Explain Rodchenko to them.

02:01:39.104 --> 02:01:40.856
A good night for a walk.

02:01:41.064 --> 02:01:43.294
Peruvians, Africans, Asians...

02:01:43.504 --> 02:01:44.983
Just keep walking.

02:01:45.144 --> 02:01:48.534
Are these countries you want
to impress with your Soviet idealism?

02:01:49.264 --> 02:01:52.700
Get your hands off me,
I'm an American diplomat!

02:01:52.944 --> 02:01:55.822
Don't be a fool, Rodchenko,
you're still a criminal.

02:01:55.984 --> 02:02:00.421
Think about it, Chaiko. The world's
gonna know Rodchenko was here.

02:02:00.624 --> 02:02:04.253
- I'll have you shot if you resist.
- Keep walking.

02:02:04.464 --> 02:02:06.102
There are witnesses!

02:02:06.304 --> 02:02:08.659
- Tell them to open the stupid gate.
- I can't.

02:02:08.904 --> 02:02:12.943
They're too far away.
It's got to be a positive identification.

02:02:13.184 --> 02:02:17.257
You'll be held responsible, Chaiko!
Moscow will hold you responsible!

02:02:17.824 --> 02:02:21.021
- You're playing with your friends' lives.
- Don't stop.

02:02:21.224 --> 02:02:24.421
She's a Soviet citizen.
I'm warning you, Rodchenko.

02:02:24.584 --> 02:02:25.573
Arrest her!

02:02:25.784 --> 02:02:28.503
No! No!

02:02:28.664 --> 02:02:30.302
Take your hands off me!

02:02:35.224 --> 02:02:37.180
You record that! Look at that woman.

02:02:37.384 --> 02:02:40.501
- Anne! It's me, Kolya!
- There he is!

02:02:41.304 --> 02:02:44.216
The last thing you need now
is evidence of Soviet repression.

02:02:44.384 --> 02:02:46.022
There's your proof.

02:02:46.384 --> 02:02:50.138
Release her with me.
I'll shut up about everything.

02:02:54.424 --> 02:02:57.143
What are you doing? Release her!

02:02:57.464 --> 02:03:00.501
Make sure the videotape is rolling.

02:03:00.704 --> 02:03:03.980
- She's just a little overexcited.
- Kolya!

02:03:04.944 --> 02:03:07.617
That's right, here he is.

02:03:08.464 --> 02:03:10.534
Don't forget I have her husband.

02:03:10.744 --> 02:03:12.382
Rodchenko, how were you treated?

02:03:14.584 --> 02:03:16.097
Very well.

02:03:16.264 --> 02:03:19.574
Now, wait. Wait. We've got to record it.
Don't do anything to spoil it.

02:03:19.864 --> 02:03:21.900
All right, open the gate.
Stay right here.

02:03:22.064 --> 02:03:26.455
The superiority of Soviet medicine
has saved a great artist's life.

02:03:26.704 --> 02:03:30.777
Our generous return of this convicted
criminal to his adopted country...

02:03:30.984 --> 02:03:35.933
...is, we trust, the proof
of our continuing struggle...

02:03:36.144 --> 02:03:40.183
...towards world peace
and brotherhood.

02:03:44.624 --> 02:03:47.661
Nik! I never gave up on you.

02:03:50.304 --> 02:03:54.695
Come in here, darling.
Come in. I knew it!

02:03:55.144 --> 02:03:59.023
Here he is, everybody! Rodchenko!
I told you.

02:04:01.184 --> 02:04:04.221
Back where you belong.

02:04:04.424 --> 02:04:06.699
Secure these gates.

02:04:19.664 --> 02:04:23.213
I'm always relieved
when the white nights are over.

02:04:23.464 --> 02:04:28.015
I'll be very relieved
when the whole business is over.

02:04:28.504 --> 02:04:30.460
Don't you feel well?

02:04:30.704 --> 02:04:33.821
Prison made you a bit pale.

02:04:34.104 --> 02:04:36.459
I want to get a message to my wife.

02:04:38.104 --> 02:04:41.062
We'll send her your things.

02:04:47.064 --> 02:04:49.020
They got out, didn't they?

02:04:50.904 --> 02:04:55.420
Funny, the Americans didn't want you
any more than we did.

02:05:00.704 --> 02:05:02.422
Get out.

02:05:04.624 --> 02:05:05.613
Tell me why...

02:05:05.784 --> 02:05:08.014
Get out, black ass.

02:05:08.904 --> 02:05:10.656
Get him out.

02:05:16.904 --> 02:05:18.337
No!

02:05:26.664 --> 02:05:29.542
So long, Greenwood.
Rifles up!

02:05:34.504 --> 02:05:35.493
Please...

02:05:36.504 --> 02:05:37.493
Walk.

02:05:44.584 --> 02:05:47.860
- Don't shoot me in the back.
- Just walk.

02:06:16.664 --> 02:06:18.780
Welcome, comrade.

02:06:20.504 --> 02:06:22.415
Thank you, comrade.

02:06:22.584 --> 02:06:24.495
Help our Latin comrade to the car.

02:06:35.904 --> 02:06:37.622
Raymond!

02:06:38.064 --> 02:06:39.702
Raymond!

02:06:50.904 --> 02:06:53.134
Raymond. Raymond.

02:06:53.304 --> 02:06:56.660
- You're across the border. Raymond.
- Dasha.

02:06:56.824 --> 02:06:58.496
You're free. You're free.

02:06:58.664 --> 02:07:01.098
- I thought I'd never see you again.
- Raymond.

02:07:01.264 --> 02:07:03.494
How? I don't understand.

02:07:03.664 --> 02:07:05.859
- How?
- You were traded.

02:07:06.104 --> 02:07:10.416
Yes. We exchanged a scum
for a hero of the people.

02:07:10.904 --> 02:07:14.214
What's the American expression?
"Something for nothing."

02:07:14.664 --> 02:07:18.862
You can pretend anything you want,
Chaiko. But you lost...

02:07:19.304 --> 02:07:20.783
...and you know it.

02:07:23.424 --> 02:07:27.622
Don't expect any "welcome home"
signs, Mr. Deserter.

02:07:40.304 --> 02:07:42.295
- I'm going home.
- Yes.

02:07:42.464 --> 02:07:44.295
For better or for worse,
I'm going home.

02:07:44.464 --> 02:07:46.056
Yes.

02:07:56.864 --> 02:07:58.616
Thanks, Nik. Thanks.
