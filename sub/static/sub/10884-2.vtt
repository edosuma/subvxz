Previously on Stitchers...

00:05.473 --> 00:06.672
Cameron!

00:06.674 --> 00:08.106
- Good morning, sunshine.
- How are you feeling?

00:08.109 --> 00:10.209
- Doctor said I'm good to go.
- What is going on with you?

00:10.211 --> 00:12.845
Climbing buildings... Slugging people?

00:12.847 --> 00:14.880
I can't help it. I died
and then I came back.

00:14.882 --> 00:16.548
I get a second chance to live my life.

00:16.550 --> 00:19.318
You see how she reacted
after Cameron revived?

00:19.320 --> 00:20.953
I've never seen her like that.

00:20.955 --> 00:23.022
- This is the rev 2.
- How is this suit going to protect me?

00:23.024 --> 00:25.057
- How do you feel?
- Slightly badass.

00:25.059 --> 00:26.859
<i>His name was Ed Clark.
Why did he kill himself?</i>

00:26.861 --> 00:28.961
He didn't and he wasn't my father.

00:28.962 --> 00:31.062
Les Turner ordered me to stop
looking into Ed Clark's murder.

00:31.065 --> 00:34.400
This facility is under my authority
until a new director is appointed.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.535
I smell something.
I smell incense again.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.337
Whoever killed Ed also killed Turner.

00:38.339 --> 00:40.039
Hey, Dad.

00:42.043 --> 00:43.042
What's that smell?

00:43.044 --> 00:44.943
That is sandalwood.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.159
When you said "fully furnished",

01:00.161 --> 01:02.694
I pictured one of those
little dorm fridges.

01:02.696 --> 01:03.962
Maybe a futon.

01:03.964 --> 01:05.898
The apartment is completely tricked out

01:05.900 --> 01:07.066
with smart appliances.

01:07.068 --> 01:08.901
I can turn on any device...

01:08.903 --> 01:10.936
With touch of an app.

01:10.938 --> 01:14.606
Lights, washer, dryer, stove-top.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.775
I'm sorry, how much money do you make?

01:16.777 --> 01:19.611
Not much. When you live
with your parents for years,

01:19.613 --> 01:20.746
the benjies start piling up.

01:20.748 --> 01:21.914
(Scoffs)

01:21.916 --> 01:23.282
Can I make you some tea?

01:25.519 --> 01:27.519
- Oh! Well, actually, that would be...
- No? Okay.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.254
Great...

01:29.256 --> 01:33.859
Wow, now you don't even have to get
off your fat ass to boil water.

01:33.861 --> 01:35.727
(Sighs)

01:35.729 --> 01:37.262
Living on my own is going to be great.

01:37.264 --> 01:40.099
You just moved out yesterday, but yes,

01:40.101 --> 01:42.267
it is a big step.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.236
What is this about a big step?

01:44.238 --> 01:47.072
- Aw! There she is.
- Hey! What are you doing here?

01:47.074 --> 01:48.140
Get out of my way.

01:48.142 --> 01:51.310
Camille! How wonderful to see you.

01:51.312 --> 01:52.945
And with my Linus.

01:55.249 --> 01:58.784
Yes, it is a treat to see you, Camille.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.319
(Laughs)

02:01.989 --> 02:04.189
We came to see this
hovel you left us for.

02:06.127 --> 02:08.227
- He doesn't mean that.
- Yes, I do.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.428
So you don't like it?

02:09.430 --> 02:12.164
He likes it. We both do.

02:12.166 --> 02:14.766
Does it matter what I like?
You have done it already.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.468
Baba, why are you being so...

02:16.470 --> 02:19.805
Ah! You never answered my question.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.340
I heard "big step."

02:22.343 --> 02:24.276
Are you two...

02:24.278 --> 02:28.280
What? Us? Here? Together?

02:28.282 --> 02:29.548
No!

02:30.784 --> 02:32.284
Ah, well, I just thought...

02:32.286 --> 02:33.819
don't take it so hard, mom.

02:33.821 --> 02:37.322
Certainly don't take it harder
than Linus abandoning us.

02:37.324 --> 02:40.926
Abandoning you? I'm 24. I
can't live at home forever.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.294
I know that, Linus.

02:42.296 --> 02:46.131
And what I know is that
a pain that a mother feels

02:46.133 --> 02:50.369
when her child leaves,
is real and it is deep.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.011

03:53.701 --> 03:55.334
So, the house you're living in,

03:55.336 --> 03:56.401
the house that you thought was Ed's,

03:56.403 --> 03:58.770
was actually your
parents' house all along.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.439
So, I guess when my father left me,

04:00.441 --> 04:03.275
instead of having me
go to Ed, he had Ed move in.

04:03.277 --> 04:05.043
You didn't know that
till that memory of you

04:05.045 --> 04:06.411
and your dad in the kitchen came back?

04:06.413 --> 04:09.081
(Chuckles) Oh, I love
how the brain works!

04:09.083 --> 04:10.382
Okay, but you never
answered my question.

04:10.384 --> 04:11.583
What do you think my father meant

04:11.585 --> 04:12.918
when I heard him in Turner's memory

04:12.920 --> 04:14.686
talking about "moving the asset"?

04:14.688 --> 04:16.288
Hey, give it a rest.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.857
I've seen how you get when you're
obsessed and it's not pretty.

04:20.293 --> 04:21.660
Speaking of pretty...

04:28.402 --> 04:30.102
I'm not quitting until I find my father.

04:30.104 --> 04:31.903
You got to get out of your own way.

04:31.905 --> 04:34.439
Okay? You're letting your new
emotions affect your reasoning.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.541
You gotta take a step back,

04:36.543 --> 04:38.677
and wait for the "ah-ha!"
Moment to come to you.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.313
Ah-ha! Come to me!

04:42.483 --> 04:44.783
Oh, my gosh!

04:45.953 --> 04:47.119
Huh?

04:49.323 --> 04:51.723
How do I look?

04:51.725 --> 04:53.625
Like a trust fund kid with a death wish.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.494
(Sputters) Hop on.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.179
Pass.

04:57.180 --> 04:58.980
Seriously, hop on! You
might actually like it.

05:00.267 --> 05:02.000
(Sputtering)

05:02.936 --> 05:05.270
(Chuckles)

05:05.272 --> 05:08.340
Feels good, right? Okay.
Now picture this.

05:08.342 --> 05:11.510
You and me, cruising down
the highway, all right?

05:11.512 --> 05:15.314
Wind, in our hair. No, but we'd
be wearing helmets. So, no.

05:15.316 --> 05:18.083
But seriously, you gotta
hold on or you're fall, okay?

05:19.153 --> 05:21.453
(Mimicking acceleration)

05:21.455 --> 05:23.755
You guys are the hottest couple ever.

05:23.757 --> 05:26.958
- Oh!
- Actually, we're not...

05:26.960 --> 05:30.362
we're not sure if this
is the right bike for us.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.130
Right, pumpkin?

05:32.132 --> 05:36.368
Actually, I didn't even know that
shnookums wanted a motorcycle

05:36.370 --> 05:38.303
until he died last week.

05:38.305 --> 05:39.771
You did what now?

05:39.773 --> 05:42.708
But lucky for muffin
I was there to save him.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.443
Mmm.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.345
- Why tempt fate, right?
- Yeah.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.281
Okay, so I guess this is...

05:49.283 --> 05:51.049
I guess I'll take it.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.785
Hmm. Sold.

05:55.222 --> 05:56.455
(Chuckling)

05:58.492 --> 06:02.294
Oh, man! My first motorcycle.

06:02.296 --> 06:04.262
Aren't you a little young
for a mid-life crisis?

06:04.264 --> 06:05.397
Hmm.

06:05.399 --> 06:07.232
(Cell phone ringing)

06:09.536 --> 06:12.204
Oh! Um...

06:12.206 --> 06:13.572
We actually gotta go to work.

06:13.574 --> 06:16.174
Is there anyway that we can
put this aside for later?

06:16.176 --> 06:17.409
Um...

06:19.513 --> 06:20.812
(Mimicking) I'll be back.

06:22.249 --> 06:24.416
'Cause Arnold said
that in <i> Terminator 2...</i>

06:24.418 --> 06:25.984
He rides a motorcycle. Sorry.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.391
Power heels?

06:32.393 --> 06:35.160
I have a meeting with our
division head, Mitchell Blair.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.596
He was Turner's boss.
He's going to be here today.

06:37.598 --> 06:38.931
Turner had a boss?

06:38.932 --> 06:40.265
Can't imagine him
taking orders from anyone.

06:40.267 --> 06:41.767
Well, everyone answers to someone.

06:41.769 --> 06:44.269
And no, I don't know what Blair wants.

06:44.271 --> 06:46.571
Well, I'd like to meet this guy
and ask him about my father.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.607
Right now I'd like us
to focus on the case.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.742
Where's Camille?

06:50.744 --> 06:52.411
She's still babysitting Fisher.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.880
Which I don't get, 'cause he's been
out of the hospital for a week.

06:54.882 --> 06:59.518
Yes, men are such babies
when they're sick or shot.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.819
Linus?

07:01.855 --> 07:03.755
Derek Steelman, 28 years old.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.558
He got hit by a car this
morning in downtown la.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.528
At one point he was number 3 on the
FBI's most wanted hacker list.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.963
Until the FBI caught him
posting internal memos

07:11.965 --> 07:14.032
from one of the "big
five" oil companies.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.801
I could only find two photos.

07:15.803 --> 07:18.537
Well, he was a hacker. He wouldn't
have wanted a big Internet footprint.

07:18.539 --> 07:21.373
Instead of prison,
the FBI offered him a deal.

07:21.375 --> 07:25.110
He turned white hat, started working for
some of our off-the-books agencies.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.211
N.C.T.C.?

07:26.213 --> 07:27.479
C.T.I.I.C.?

07:27.481 --> 07:29.114
Both: R.E.S.P.E.C.T?

07:30.984 --> 07:32.784
Among others.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.720
His job was to prevent cyber-terrorists
from breaching our systems.

07:35.722 --> 07:38.490
So he could have been killed
because of something he found out.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.893
Wait! What is that?

07:43.330 --> 07:45.997
That's an Insulin pump. Derek was
wearing at the time of death.

07:45.999 --> 07:49.501
Witnesses say Derek looked disoriented
before he walked into traffic.

07:49.503 --> 07:51.069
Was he drunk? On drugs?

07:52.239 --> 07:55.240
But we can't wait 48 hours
to get his tox screen.

07:55.242 --> 07:58.143
If Derek was murdered,
we need to know how and why.

07:58.145 --> 08:02.013
All right, Derek's mind map indicates there
are a few speed bumps along memory lane.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.982
Might have something to do
with getting hit by a car.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.684
Okay, what happens if we hit one?

08:05.686 --> 08:07.152
We'll take a detour.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.020
I need a go, no-go for stitch neurosync.
Life-sci?

08:09.022 --> 08:09.847
Go.

08:09.872 --> 08:11.757
Everything just sounds
so much better British.

08:11.758 --> 08:13.458
- Sub-bio?
- Go.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.026
- The big man himself engineering?
- Go.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.962
What's with you?

08:16.964 --> 08:19.030
I'm just happy because this baller is
getting his first motorcycle today.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.432
Communications?

08:20.434 --> 08:23.168
Communications is highly
impressed by this news. Go.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.870
- Medical?
- We are go.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.839
And as medical officer I advise
against the purchase of a motorcycle.

08:27.841 --> 08:31.843
Fantastic! Comm check, Kirsten, one two,
one two. Do you hear me as your rider?

08:31.845 --> 08:33.945
Oh, I hear you, baller.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.679
Okay, I'll take that as a go.

08:35.682 --> 08:39.583
Induce stitch neurosync on my mark.
In three, two, one... mark!

08:41.355 --> 08:42.687
Unbelievable.

08:44.358 --> 08:45.857
I'm in Derek's workshop.

08:45.859 --> 08:49.027
He's got enough equipment in here
to crack any database he wants.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.730
Which, I suspect, is a
violation of his parole.

08:51.732 --> 08:54.966
I am the only reason you are
still alive and I am sick

08:54.968 --> 08:56.301
of cleaning up your messes!

08:56.303 --> 08:58.737
I'm gonna deal with it my way.
You knew this from the start.

08:58.739 --> 09:01.373
If you can't deal with it, then by
all means, cut me loose at any time.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.675
It's not that simple,
Derek and you know that.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.477
Then what do you want me to do?

09:05.479 --> 09:07.712
Do as I tell you or you
are going to end up dead.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.315
She just threatened to kill
him if he didn't do something.

09:10.317 --> 09:11.750
- You see a name?
- No.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.752
Take me as close as you
can to his time of death.

09:16.323 --> 09:19.224
I'm with Derek on the street.
So far he seems okay.

09:21.428 --> 09:22.994
Tell her to watch him closely.

09:22.996 --> 09:25.664
See if anyone brushes past
him, makes physical contact

09:25.666 --> 09:29.234
that could mask a needle prick
or a chemical transfer.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.236
Kirsten, look for anyone
making contact with him.

09:33.507 --> 09:35.106
He just got an e-mail.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.875
Uh, I can't see it.

09:36.877 --> 09:40.779
Uh... hey, just try moving just
your consciousness closer to him.

09:40.781 --> 09:41.781
What? I can do that?

09:43.717 --> 09:44.717
Absolutely.

09:47.788 --> 09:50.755
Okay, the text reads, "five million sent.
Destroy the list."

09:50.757 --> 09:53.925
- Who is it from?
- Jm@Stealaglance.Com.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.628
Stealaglance? I know that website.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.496
It's where married people
go to have affairs.

10:01.868 --> 10:03.935
What? I bought stock.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.404
Okay, well maybe Derek
worked for Stealaglance.

10:06.406 --> 10:08.607
Or blackmailing them. Wait.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.277
Something's wrong.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.745
I'm seeing double.

10:13.747 --> 10:14.879
Heart rate is elevating.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.083
He's checking his Insulin pump.

10:18.085 --> 10:20.652
Ayo: A sudden overdose
of Insulin could be fatal.

10:20.654 --> 10:23.755
He's trying to tear it out.
Everything is getting dark.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.156
Oh, God! Car!

10:25.158 --> 10:26.658
Make the bounce!

10:29.963 --> 10:31.730
Okay, the car finished him off,

10:31.732 --> 10:34.499
but it was really Derek's
Insulin pump that killed him.

10:41.074 --> 10:43.742
Derek's Insulin pump
administered a massive overdose.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.810
He was suffering from Insulin shock.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.646
Could it have malfunctioned?

10:47.647 --> 10:49.481
His pump is one of the most
reliable on the market.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.416
Failure rate of less than .0002.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.351
Here's what I think might have happened.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.787
Derek was blackmailing
a billion dollar company,

10:55.789 --> 10:59.858
and the last email he got came
from jm@Stealaglance.Com,

10:59.860 --> 11:02.293
who turns out to be Jacob McGuire,

11:02.295 --> 11:03.828
founder and CEO.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.331
Maybe McGuire had Derek killed
for stealing his client list.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.352
Which, if it were ever released,

11:07.377 --> 11:09.735
would effectively put
Stealaglance out of business.

11:10.580 --> 11:11.916
But...

11:12.773 --> 11:14.806
How could they trigger Derek's pump?

11:14.808 --> 11:16.675
Could have been hacked.

11:16.677 --> 11:19.277
I mean, it's Internet
and cellular connected.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.813
It's difficult, but mostly makes sense.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.615
But why would they kill him

11:23.617 --> 11:25.650
if they know that their client list
was still out there in the wild?

11:25.652 --> 11:26.851
I said "mostly".

11:26.853 --> 11:29.854
Then find McGuire and make
him make total sense.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.526
Wait, hey, I want to meet
this Blair guy.

11:34.528 --> 11:37.195
Yeah, if he was Turner's boss,
he must be a total badass.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.897
Yes, a badass who is not on time.

11:38.899 --> 11:41.066
He's coming here to meet me.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.834
You guys have a job to do.

11:42.836 --> 11:45.870
(Grunting)

11:45.872 --> 11:47.906
(Music playing)

11:52.045 --> 11:53.578
You looking good.

11:57.851 --> 11:58.717
Feeling weak.

11:58.719 --> 12:00.251
Well...

12:00.253 --> 12:02.754
Considering it wasn't that long
ago you were flat on your back,

12:02.756 --> 12:05.724
I expected to find you on the couch
covered in potato chip dust.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.861
Thanks for getting me
off my ass in the hospital.

12:09.863 --> 12:12.764
Golly, don't go all
weepy on me now, Fishy.

12:12.766 --> 12:15.166
Don't worry. You still bug me.

12:16.103 --> 12:17.736
What's happening back at the lab?

12:17.738 --> 12:19.604
Well, you know, nerds...

12:19.606 --> 12:22.040
Techno babble. Pretty much
everything as you left it.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.875
How's Kirsten holding up?

12:23.877 --> 12:27.612
No leads on Daniel Stinger,
which makes her a little crabby.

12:27.614 --> 12:29.380
Which makes me a little crabby.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.783
Didn't know she could do crabby...

12:31.785 --> 12:33.251
Or any other emotion, for that matter.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.453
Right. So, tell me about your bag.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.022
Come again?

12:38.024 --> 12:40.925
This? Is this just for exercise?

12:40.927 --> 12:44.462
Or can you actually learn how to...

12:44.464 --> 12:47.699
Hit things by working on it? And
by "you", of course I mean me.

12:47.701 --> 12:49.234
Why are you making that face?

12:49.236 --> 12:50.902
Why do you wanna learn how to hit stuff?

12:50.904 --> 12:52.971
'Cause I wanna know how
to protect myself.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.373
Come on, you got shot

12:55.375 --> 12:57.842
and Turner is dead.

12:59.479 --> 13:03.381
Here... Take a couple shots.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.517
Just like that?

13:08.755 --> 13:10.655
Oh, that's fantastic...

13:10.657 --> 13:13.324
If you're defending yourself against
a group of marauding grandmothers.

13:13.326 --> 13:16.528
Okay, calm down. Jeez!

13:18.832 --> 13:20.899
Maybe you should just
stick to the brain stuff.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.801
Maybe you should stick
to being a neanderthal.

13:24.337 --> 13:25.570
(Chuckles)

13:25.572 --> 13:28.940
All right, well, your form sucks...

13:28.942 --> 13:30.241
But, you hit hard.

13:30.243 --> 13:31.943
Story of my life.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.745
Put your whole body
behind it, all right?

13:33.747 --> 13:35.980
Torque your waist, one
punch leads to the other.

13:35.982 --> 13:36.982
Like this...

13:37.918 --> 13:41.019
Whoa! Careful! Easy,
you're gonna pop a stitch.

13:41.021 --> 13:43.721
Yeah... yeah, you may be right.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.193
You know, with a little
training, you'd kick ass.

13:48.195 --> 13:49.828
Wait, really?

13:49.830 --> 13:54.132
Yeah. I could teach you some stuff.
Work on your technique.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.367
Then you can be a lean,
mean snarky machine.

13:56.369 --> 13:57.902
Keep talking, string bean.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.042
- Hey.
- Hi.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.978
Camille told me that you don't
have any leads on your father.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.847
(Sighing) Nope.

14:08.849 --> 14:11.883
Start with what you know.
The day and time he left,

14:11.885 --> 14:14.552
the cab company. See if their
have records to go back that far.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.354
Don't worry. Stinger messed up somewhere.
You'll get him.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.890
I know, thanks!

14:18.892 --> 14:20.792
I heard you two were going
to talk to McGuire?

14:20.794 --> 14:22.160
Who's McGuire?

14:22.162 --> 14:25.196
He is the CEO of Stealaglance.com.

14:25.198 --> 14:28.833
His client list was hacked and he was being
blackmailed for five million dollars.

14:28.835 --> 14:30.501
Blackmailer got murdered.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.737
Sounds like McGuire had motive.
What'd he say?

14:32.739 --> 14:36.007
No, McGuire wouldn't talk to
us without his lawyer present.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.842
Kirsten: Wait, we should
check his bank records.

14:37.844 --> 14:40.345
There's no way he paid that five
million from the company account.

14:40.347 --> 14:41.846
He must have used a personal account.

14:41.848 --> 14:43.481
We could hack his bank, why not?

14:43.483 --> 14:45.149
And if we had the account numbers
we could get in pretty quickly.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.886
Or you could find a judge
to issue a warrant.

14:47.888 --> 14:50.255
(Exclaiming dismissively)

14:50.257 --> 14:51.856
But that would also take time.

14:51.858 --> 14:54.792
Guys! We could do this the legal way,

14:55.996 --> 14:57.562
or we could do it my way.

14:58.932 --> 15:00.492
We still have RFID scanners in the lab?

15:02.035 --> 15:03.067
Yeah.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.069
I'll go get my couture.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.056
(Sighs)

15:25.058 --> 15:27.392
You know the only thing
I hate more than lines?

15:27.394 --> 15:29.360
- No, tell me.
- Waiting in them.

15:30.964 --> 15:33.598
If you'd like to cut in front of
me, all you have to do is ask.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.099
I thought that's what I just did.

15:37.537 --> 15:38.970
I don't remember seeing you inside.

15:38.972 --> 15:41.806
Oh, you just remember everyone
in the same restaurant as you?

15:41.808 --> 15:44.242
No. But you, I'd remember.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.277
(Chuckles)

15:46.279 --> 15:48.579
He's smooth, he's confident...

15:48.581 --> 15:52.750
He smells like a million bucks.
You're trouble.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.052
And you're beautiful.

15:54.054 --> 15:56.187
- (Giggling) Keep talking, killer.
- (Device bleeping)

15:58.558 --> 16:01.326
On second thought, I gotta bounce.

16:02.662 --> 16:03.828
What about your car?

16:03.830 --> 16:04.929
I don't own one.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.966
Wait, can I get your number?

16:07.968 --> 16:10.001
That's okay, baby. I've got yours.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.605
So, according to the trip sheets,

16:14.607 --> 16:16.074
the taxi dropped my father off

16:16.076 --> 16:18.176
at the Bradley international terminal
the night he left me with Ed.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.844
You got into their records?

16:19.846 --> 16:21.179
Yeah, I mean they could care less

16:21.181 --> 16:23.581
about someone snooping through
trip sheets from 15 years ago.

16:23.583 --> 16:28.286
Now I just need to figure out what airline
my father took and where he was going.

16:28.288 --> 16:31.122
Hmm. Ooh!

16:31.124 --> 16:33.791
So, how'd we do? Did you
get his account numbers?

16:33.793 --> 16:37.028
She's got brains, she's got all this.

16:37.030 --> 16:39.597
The RFID scanner read the
chips on every credit card

16:39.599 --> 16:42.200
in his wallet. Digital pickpocketing.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.701
What will they think of next?

16:43.703 --> 16:46.104
- That's amazing.
- What a time to be alive, you guys!

17:06.159 --> 17:07.258
Miss Baptiste?

17:08.560 --> 17:10.261
I'm Mitchell Blair.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.131
(Chuckles)

17:14.534 --> 17:16.067
How did you get in here?

17:17.002 --> 17:19.170
Well, I built this place,

17:19.172 --> 17:21.039
so I think I know where
all the entrances are.

17:23.576 --> 17:27.845
Well, next time, you should
let me know you're here.

17:27.847 --> 17:29.647
It'll help me not shoot you.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.382
Noted. Noted.

17:32.886 --> 17:35.553
Miss Baptiste, you are a legend

17:35.555 --> 17:36.654
at the agency.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.756
And you, Mr. Blair, are an unknown.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.124
(Chuckles)

17:41.227 --> 17:43.561
Your reputation for plain
talks is not for nothing.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.264
Congratulations.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.865
For?

17:47.867 --> 17:49.867
Effective immediately, you're
promoted to acting director

17:49.869 --> 17:51.569
of the Stitchers program.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.237
Not sure I want the job.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.225
Sure you do.

17:57.226 --> 17:59.210
Perhaps if I knew more about
Turner's responsibilities

17:59.212 --> 18:02.747
I'd feel better about the decision
that's being made for me.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.950
I assume his job involved more than

18:05.952 --> 18:09.454
lurking in the shadows
and making cryptic comments.

18:11.291 --> 18:15.093
Well, Les had his hands in a few other
pies, but for now, your purview

18:15.095 --> 18:17.161
is strictly the Stitchers program.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.231
Out of curiosity, or...

18:20.233 --> 18:22.633
Self preservation,

18:22.635 --> 18:26.104
was Les's purview as head of the
Stitchers program the reason

18:26.106 --> 18:27.705
Daniel Stinger killed him?

18:29.709 --> 18:31.442
You're sneaky.

18:31.444 --> 18:35.613
You're trying to get me to confirm
that Danny killed Turner.

18:35.615 --> 18:39.584
Then again, maybe I am the sneaky one

18:39.586 --> 18:42.153
for calling Stinger... Danny to...

18:42.155 --> 18:45.223
Make you think he and I had a
particularly close relationship.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.627
What do I have to do to get a
straight answer from this agency?

18:51.131 --> 18:52.964
Start by doing your job.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.800
- Are we done here?
- I think so.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.169
Don't you?

18:58.171 --> 19:00.004
Enjoy your promotion.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.785
Oh, wow!

19:14.787 --> 19:17.840
Whoever is behind this, is crazy good.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.848
They ran an I and D scam.

19:19.873 --> 19:21.949
Oh, my gosh!

19:21.974 --> 19:25.006
It's an intercept and divert.

19:25.031 --> 19:27.365
They rigged a computer
at McGuire's bank,

19:27.367 --> 19:29.667
to direct all of it's
data to a local node

19:29.669 --> 19:31.104
it intercepted the transfer,

19:31.128 --> 19:33.515
sent a false confirmation
that the wire transfer happened,

19:33.540 --> 19:36.460
and diverted the funds somewhere else.
Probably an off-shore bank account.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.776
Is that easy to do?

19:38.778 --> 19:40.611
By a single person? No.

19:40.613 --> 19:43.981
I think we are dealing with a
super-posse of black hat experts.

19:43.983 --> 19:46.484
I downloaded the connection log
from Derek's Insulin pump,

19:46.486 --> 19:48.653
it was hacked through
the cellular connection.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.188
Dude, who are these guys?

19:50.190 --> 19:53.124
I don't know, but I think I
found one of them. Lucy woods.

19:53.126 --> 19:55.393
I pinged the cell phone
towers near the murder site

19:55.395 --> 19:57.662
and then traced the signal back.

19:57.664 --> 20:00.031
Okay, she's the one I saw
threatening Derek in the stitch.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.833
You know what we need?
An interrogation room.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.303
- Why?
- Because Lucy's got some 'splaining to do.

20:09.742 --> 20:10.818
Mmm-mmm.

20:10.842 --> 20:13.888
I'm not answering any more questions
until somebody tells me where I am.

20:13.913 --> 20:16.747
We told you, you're in
a secure NSA facility.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.816
Okay, why do I have to be brought
here in a windowless van?

20:18.818 --> 20:21.552
Because it's a secret,
secure NSA facility.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.720
Tell us about Derek.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.222
Specifically, his Insulin pump.

20:25.592 --> 20:29.227
Derek was so smart
on his computer, but...

20:29.229 --> 20:30.761
When it came to...

20:30.763 --> 20:33.698
Real life stuff? You know, like taking
care of himself? He was an idiot.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.399
What do you mean?

20:35.401 --> 20:39.270
He was diabetic, so I had to be
on him all the time about that.

20:39.272 --> 20:42.840
You know, "take your
medicine", "watch your diet",

20:42.842 --> 20:46.277
I was such a total bitch about it,
but I was just scared, you know?

20:46.279 --> 20:49.247
I thought for sure he was
gonna end up dead one day.

20:49.249 --> 20:52.583
But I never thought that he
would get hit by a car instead.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.620
I don't think she killed him.

20:57.390 --> 21:01.058
Hey, wait? Kill Derek? Why would
you think that I would kill him?

21:01.060 --> 21:03.894
Someone hacked in and took
control of Derek's Insulin pump.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.663
Their I.P. address matches yours.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.700
I'm not a hacker.

21:09.702 --> 21:12.370
I can't even figure out how to disable
Candy Crush requests from my grandma.

21:12.372 --> 21:17.408
I mean, I print cat photos
on t-shirts in a mall kiosk.

21:17.410 --> 21:19.877
That was Derek's world, it wasn't mine.

21:22.148 --> 21:23.447
What mall?

21:25.785 --> 21:27.718
Well, I, my friends, am impressed.

21:27.720 --> 21:31.622
Someone spoofed Lucy's I.P. address
to infiltrate Derek's pump.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.258
So our super-hackers used
Derek, a convicted hacker,

21:34.260 --> 21:36.727
as a front to swipe Stealaglance's
client list which were released,

21:36.729 --> 21:38.796
would destroy the company.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.499
Super-hackers then blackmail McGuire whom
they know would gladly pay five million

21:41.501 --> 21:43.000
to save his billion dollar company.

21:43.002 --> 21:45.636
And once the money transfers,
they ping Derek's pump

21:45.638 --> 21:47.338
and deliver a fatal overdose of Insulin.

21:47.340 --> 21:49.140
McGuire will never go to the police

21:49.142 --> 21:50.841
because he'd have to go public about
his client list being stolen.

21:50.843 --> 21:53.577
And with Derek accidentally
dead there are no loose ends.

21:53.579 --> 21:56.314
Derek was the perfect patsy
for the perfect crime.

21:56.316 --> 21:59.016
That makes them hacking, framing,
black-mailing murderers.

21:59.018 --> 22:00.117
A quadruple threat.

22:00.119 --> 22:02.320
Whoever these guys are, they're good.

22:02.322 --> 22:03.921
Better than you two?

22:03.923 --> 22:05.423
Both: Don't be ridiculous.

22:05.425 --> 22:07.858
I've already traced the Insulin
pump hack to a fixed address

22:07.860 --> 22:09.627
in eagle rock.

22:09.629 --> 22:11.228
- Let's go say hi.
- All right.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.867
Get this back to Catgirl.

22:16.869 --> 22:18.389
I don't want anything to do with that.

22:19.472 --> 22:21.872
(Music blaring on radio)

22:41.894 --> 22:44.462
Okay, maybe Camille
got the address wrong.

22:44.464 --> 22:46.664
Or maybe Camille got the exact address

22:46.666 --> 22:49.333
these guys wanted us to have.
One that leads us nowhere.

22:49.335 --> 22:51.569
Yeah, but why this nowhere?

22:51.571 --> 22:52.703
I don't know.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.138
These guys are out-thinking us,

22:54.140 --> 22:56.040
I don't like to be out-thunk.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.042
Whoever they are, they're really good.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.977
Please tell me you're not fan-girling.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.912
Well they're murderers, so no.

23:01.914 --> 23:03.547
(Cell phone ringing)

23:07.720 --> 23:10.521
- Hello?
- You're not fan-girling?

23:10.523 --> 23:12.256
I would have thought
you'd be more impressed,

23:12.258 --> 23:14.425
- Kirsten Clark of 986 Baxter street.
- Who is it?

23:17.397 --> 23:21.265
<i>I'm your team of hackers.
Only there's no team,</i>

23:21.267 --> 23:22.466
<i>it's just me.</i>

23:23.503 --> 23:25.470
No way!

23:25.471 --> 23:27.438
<i>And FYI, not every homicide is a murder.</i>

23:27.440 --> 23:29.440
Sometimes it's justice.

23:29.442 --> 23:31.409
<i>Look how cute you two are.</i>

23:31.411 --> 23:33.043
<i>Your heads all close.</i>

23:33.045 --> 23:35.112
Do you and Cameron have a ship name yet?

23:35.114 --> 23:36.614
What does that mean?

23:37.450 --> 23:38.949
<i>Warmer...</i>

23:40.586 --> 23:42.086
<i>Warmer...</i>

23:43.856 --> 23:45.189
<i>Warmer...</i>

23:46.426 --> 23:47.658
<i>Keep going.</i>

23:48.761 --> 23:50.094
<i>Hotter...</i>

23:53.433 --> 23:55.266
<i>Bingo!</i>

23:57.570 --> 23:59.737
You pinged our phones to
pull our information.

23:59.739 --> 24:02.039
Considering you were
all-American in high school,

24:02.041 --> 24:06.477
and have a 4.59 GPA in your
computer science doctoral program,

24:06.479 --> 24:08.779
I would have thought
you'd figure that out sooner.

24:08.781 --> 24:11.649
<i>Maybe that leave of absence
you took is making you rusty.</i>

24:13.085 --> 24:15.152
Seeing how you know our names,

24:15.154 --> 24:16.587
why don't you tell me yours?

24:16.589 --> 24:18.389
<i>Well, that would be cheating,</i>

24:18.391 --> 24:20.257
and I hate cheaters.

24:20.259 --> 24:22.159
Oh, this isn't a game.

24:22.161 --> 24:23.227
Isn't it?

24:24.564 --> 24:26.897
Okay, tell me something,

24:26.899 --> 24:31.502
why Derek? There are dozens of hackers
you could've used to blackmail McGuire.

24:31.504 --> 24:33.637
Well, that's my business.

24:33.639 --> 24:36.006
You tell me something, why do you care?

24:37.510 --> 24:38.709
That's my business.

24:39.812 --> 24:40.978
I think I like you.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.681
Okay, then let's meet.
We'll talk this out.

24:43.683 --> 24:46.350
<i>Ooh, girls' night?</i>

24:46.352 --> 24:49.019
Sounds fun. Find me,

24:49.021 --> 24:51.121
and we'll chat about whatever you want.

24:51.123 --> 24:53.624
Sounds good. I will see you soon.

24:53.626 --> 24:55.292
Are you sure you want to do this?

24:55.294 --> 24:57.628
Oh, game on!

24:57.630 --> 25:00.531
Okay. Oh, and Kirsten...

25:02.702 --> 25:04.535
Be careful what you wish for.

25:05.438 --> 25:06.871
<i>My name is Ellie.</i>

25:06.873 --> 25:08.606
(Line clicks)

25:13.012 --> 25:14.545
(Music playing)

25:28.194 --> 25:30.661
Please? Please, just let me do this.

25:30.663 --> 25:33.631
My computer, my rules.
You don't like it,

25:33.633 --> 25:35.165
there's the door.

25:35.167 --> 25:37.568
Yeah, leave my Fishy alone.
He's having fun.

25:37.570 --> 25:39.970
Don't forget to torque your waist.

25:39.972 --> 25:41.138
I'm torquing!

25:41.140 --> 25:42.540
He actually looks like an ape

25:42.542 --> 25:43.908
playing piano.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.309
Yeah, come on old man.

25:45.311 --> 25:46.844
At the rate you're trying
to log into the LAPD system,

25:46.846 --> 25:47.878
even I could hack in faster.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.381
Maybe, but then I'd have to shoot you.

25:50.383 --> 25:53.717
- Fair enough.
- And, I'm logged in.

25:55.087 --> 25:58.656
Okay, I'm looking at
Derek Steelman's file.

25:58.658 --> 26:00.558
No connection to anyone named Ellie.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.326
Anyone with the first
name Ellie arrested?

26:02.328 --> 26:05.396
Yeah. Only about two hundred
in the last five years.

26:05.398 --> 26:07.865
Hmm. Well, this was fun.

26:07.867 --> 26:09.767
Oh, where are you going?

26:09.769 --> 26:11.835
We've got seven hours until
the refractory period's up.

26:11.837 --> 26:14.071
We'll stitch back in tomorrow
and see if we missed anything.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.206
Until then, my new bike is calling.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.741
- You're buying a bicycle?
- Motorcycle!

26:17.743 --> 26:19.009
(Laughing)

26:21.447 --> 26:25.316
- You know how to ride?
- Uh-huh. How hard could it be?

26:26.719 --> 26:29.219
As we bid farewell to the wild one.

26:29.221 --> 26:31.121
Yeah, we better not.

26:31.123 --> 26:33.757
I can't believe all of this
was done by one person.

26:33.759 --> 26:36.060
Ellie left no digital
breadcrumbs for us to follow,

26:36.062 --> 26:37.895
but she did make one big mistake.

26:37.897 --> 26:39.730
- What? What's that?
- She spoke to me.

26:39.732 --> 26:42.566
Oh, come on. You're not so
bad to talk to anymore.

26:42.568 --> 26:44.368
(Laughing sarcastically)

26:45.972 --> 26:50.941
Ellie said that killing Derek was
not a homicide, it was justice.

26:50.943 --> 26:53.744
She also said that she hates cheaters.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.579
And she likes games.

26:55.581 --> 26:58.048
Okay so, maybe she and
Derek were competing,

26:58.050 --> 27:00.784
he cheated, and that's
why she killed him?

27:00.786 --> 27:03.253
A hacking competition?
Is that even a thing?

27:03.255 --> 27:04.888
Maybe.

27:04.890 --> 27:07.157
But why target Stealaglance
for extortion?

27:07.159 --> 27:10.494
It's a website entirely devoted to
cheating with very deep pockets.

27:10.496 --> 27:13.197
- It is the perfect symbolic target.
- True.

27:15.735 --> 27:18.268
- Hey!
- You know I have a lot of research to do,

27:18.270 --> 27:20.904
and if I have to watch you typing
away with two fingers again,

27:20.906 --> 27:22.640
I'm literally going to scream.

27:26.112 --> 27:29.413
Torque, woman! Nice!

27:32.685 --> 27:34.485
Oh, God, please tell me that one worked.

27:34.487 --> 27:36.620
I'm sorry. This one was also canceled.

27:36.622 --> 27:40.190
And your bank card shows
insufficient funds. As in none.

27:40.192 --> 27:42.526
But... how is it possible

27:42.528 --> 27:44.828
that all three of my credits cards are...

27:46.699 --> 27:48.532
- you bitch.
- Excuse me?

27:48.534 --> 27:49.800
No, sorry not you. A different bitch.

27:49.802 --> 27:51.669
I gotta go! Can I get
my cards back, please?

27:52.705 --> 27:53.749
What?

27:53.750 --> 27:55.650
The bank instructed us to cut the cards,

27:55.675 --> 27:56.728
but if you got a complaint,

27:56.752 --> 27:58.915
I'm sure there's a bitch
at the bank you can talk to.

28:00.813 --> 28:01.845
Okay.

28:05.384 --> 28:06.850
(Music playing)

28:09.355 --> 28:12.690
They cut up all your cards? Even
your super-special black one?

28:12.692 --> 28:15.159
Especially the little black one.

28:15.161 --> 28:17.461
Ellie hacked my accounts.

28:17.463 --> 28:20.531
(Sighs) I pissed her off
and she took it out on you.

28:20.533 --> 28:24.234
Look, we will get your credit straightened
out tomorrow. In the meantime,

28:24.236 --> 28:26.570
I researched every hacking
competition around the world,

28:26.572 --> 28:27.805
and I pulled up a list of names.

28:27.807 --> 28:29.840
Derek or Ellie on the list?

28:29.842 --> 28:32.209
I can't tell. Most of them
compete under aliases.

28:32.211 --> 28:33.711
But I'm cross-referencing them now.

28:33.713 --> 28:36.346
Wait, wait. How do we know she's
not listening to us right now?

28:36.348 --> 28:39.049
Well, frankly, I hope she is.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.651
I'm coming for you, Ellie.

28:40.653 --> 28:43.087
Okay, just in case
we're not being paranoid,

28:43.089 --> 28:45.422
let's try not to make evil
hacker lady mad again, huh?

28:45.424 --> 28:48.759
I thought your new policy
was not to live in fear?

28:48.761 --> 28:51.201
And I thought your new policy was
not to do anything reckless.

28:53.032 --> 28:56.333
- Anything new about your dad?
- Unfortunately...

28:56.335 --> 29:00.704
Within three hours of the taxi dropping
him off at the terminal, there were

29:00.706 --> 29:05.542
80 flights going to 67 cities
in 34 different countries.

29:05.544 --> 29:08.512
Over ten thousand passengers, and
it seems he used a fake name.

29:08.514 --> 29:10.080
- So he could be...
- Anywhere.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.615
(Knocking on door)

29:11.617 --> 29:13.016
Wait, someone's here. Hold on.

29:17.556 --> 29:19.356
- Kirsten Clark?
- Yes?

29:19.358 --> 29:21.959
We have a warrant for your arrest.

29:21.961 --> 29:23.627
On what charge?

29:23.629 --> 29:26.864
<i>Violation of California
penal code 647(B) PC.</i>

29:26.866 --> 29:27.866
Prostitution.

29:31.771 --> 29:33.804
Cameron, I think I have
to call you back.

29:33.806 --> 29:35.139
Yeah.

29:36.075 --> 29:37.608
(Knocking on door)

29:39.912 --> 29:43.046
- Where are they?
- Oh, the cops? They left.

29:45.951 --> 29:46.917
You got Ellied.

29:46.919 --> 29:49.353
Yes, I did. I got Ellied.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.890
So why aren't you in a
holding tank downtown,

29:52.892 --> 29:53.924
with a dozen ladies named Trixie?

29:53.926 --> 29:55.993
(Chuckles) Well...

29:55.995 --> 29:58.495
The arrest warrant disappeared
from the LAPD server.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.931
Ellie didn't actually
want me to get arrested,

30:00.933 --> 30:04.051
she just wants to show
me how good she is.

30:04.052 --> 30:07.452
Oh! She's really good. Yeah! She managed to
freeze every bank account I've ever owned.

30:08.607 --> 30:10.574
I'm poor now.

30:10.576 --> 30:12.142
I don't care for it.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.410
(Cell phone bleeps)

30:13.412 --> 30:15.846
What?

30:15.848 --> 30:17.181
Oh, speak of the devil.

30:19.018 --> 30:20.350
We were just talking about you.

30:20.352 --> 30:21.919
Good things, I hope.

30:21.921 --> 30:24.343
Ah, no. Not really.

30:24.368 --> 30:26.679
<i>Come on.
This is like that Star Trek episode</i>

30:26.703 --> 30:28.426
<i>where Kirk and the Romulan commander</i>

30:28.427 --> 30:32.830
battle each other but in the end
develop a deep, mutual respect.

30:32.832 --> 30:34.798
Ah, I have no idea what
you're talking about.

30:34.800 --> 30:38.035
- I do.
<i>- FYI, Cameron wasn't being paranoid.</i>

30:38.037 --> 30:40.037
I was listening in on your call.

30:40.039 --> 30:42.940
And to be honest, for someone who
says she's "coming to get me",

30:42.942 --> 30:44.341
you're doing a lousy job.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.476
I'm just getting warmed up.

30:46.478 --> 30:50.214
Cameron, I know you're listening in.
So sorry about those credit cards.

30:50.216 --> 30:53.483
Oh, no, it's fine. Once Kirsten catches
you, I'll just make you into pieces.

30:53.485 --> 30:55.519
Any idea when that might be?

30:55.521 --> 30:59.656
I hope not right now, because
I have bigger fish to fry.

30:59.658 --> 31:01.391
Which is actually an apt analogy.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.393
What are you talking about?

31:03.395 --> 31:06.730
Well, it would seem from your frequently
dialed list that you're good friends with

31:06.732 --> 31:08.823
Linus Ahluwalia.

31:08.848 --> 31:12.135
Yes? I love that smart
apartment he just leased.

31:12.137 --> 31:13.971
They're so easy to hack.

31:13.973 --> 31:16.306
- What have you done?
- Not much.

31:16.308 --> 31:19.076
<i>Just started a gas flow
from his stove top</i>

31:19.078 --> 31:21.011
<i>and then upped the voltage in his unit.</i>

31:21.013 --> 31:24.047
<i>In theory, when he flips the
wall switch the power spike</i>

31:24.049 --> 31:27.918
should cause his fancy led lights to
blow out and trigger a gas explosion.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.220
<i>But, yeah. That's just a theory.</i>

31:30.222 --> 31:31.622
Call Linus!

31:36.095 --> 31:37.995
Pick up the phone, come on!

31:39.832 --> 31:41.865
Pick up, pick up, pick up!

31:41.867 --> 31:43.367
Automated voice: <i>We're sorry.
Your call cannot...</i>

31:43.369 --> 31:44.835
she blocked his line.

31:44.837 --> 31:46.003
Let's go! Let's go!

31:48.707 --> 31:50.841
(Hissing)

31:52.077 --> 31:54.678
Smart locks. I love this place.

32:00.286 --> 32:02.920
No!

32:02.922 --> 32:04.087
(Sighs)

32:04.089 --> 32:06.256
(Groaning)

32:06.258 --> 32:07.958
Do you smell gas?

32:07.960 --> 32:09.626
You startled me.

32:13.966 --> 32:17.234
All I'm saying is that
Ellie is a hacking ninja

32:17.236 --> 32:20.437
and that you and Kirsten could
probably learn a few things from her.

32:20.439 --> 32:21.972
She's a murderous psycho,

32:21.974 --> 32:25.108
who, if I'm remembering this
correctly, just tried to kill you!

32:26.111 --> 32:28.946
Yeah! Wait, why did she try to kill me?

32:28.948 --> 32:31.581
To toy with Kirsten.
Because you're expendable.

32:31.583 --> 32:32.783
Thanks.

32:32.785 --> 32:35.419
Okay. There you are.
What took you so long?

32:35.421 --> 32:38.121
Anyone else ever get
an idea while in the shower?

32:39.658 --> 32:40.958
Sometimes I get an idea.

32:42.127 --> 32:43.127
Yeah, me, too.

32:44.063 --> 32:45.562
But not every time I shower.

32:45.564 --> 32:47.664
Oh, God, no! That's too many ideas.

32:47.666 --> 32:49.433
Oh, my God. Continue.

32:49.435 --> 32:54.096
(Sighs) Ellie is not just a hacker,
she's like a hacking ninja.

32:54.121 --> 32:54.994
Told you!

32:55.018 --> 32:57.584
She deleted every online
trace of her existence.

32:57.609 --> 32:59.676
But the one thing that she
couldn't touch was Derek's memory.

32:59.678 --> 33:02.112
Yeah, but we don't know enough
about Ellie to find those traces.

33:02.114 --> 33:04.081
- She's a cipher.
- Here's the idea I had.

33:04.083 --> 33:07.017
What if Stealaglance
wasn't a symbolic target?

33:07.019 --> 33:11.188
What if Derek betrayed Ellie but
felt really badly about it.

33:11.190 --> 33:12.622
Like really badly.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.124
Where does guilt manifest in the brain?

33:14.126 --> 33:15.592
The lowermost part of the frontal lobe

33:15.594 --> 33:17.160
in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.

33:17.162 --> 33:20.263
Okay, so we look in the ventro-whatever

33:20.265 --> 33:22.766
for guilt markers. Five bucks says
that's where we're gonna find Ellie.

33:22.768 --> 33:24.134
Look at you saying words.

33:24.136 --> 33:25.669
Hold on.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.104
All of you give me your phones.

33:27.106 --> 33:29.172
Ellie's tracking your
movements using them.

33:29.174 --> 33:32.009
I'm not going to risk a repeat
of what happened to Linus.

33:33.112 --> 33:34.845
Analog? Nice!

33:36.782 --> 33:39.149
- No.
- This isn't up for discussion.

33:39.151 --> 33:43.320
Ellie wants to talk to me and right
now our only link to her is my phone.

33:43.322 --> 33:46.156
And if she uses her connection
to you to kill one of us?

33:46.158 --> 33:47.791
Would you be able to live with that?

33:48.861 --> 33:52.095
No. That's why I won't let that happen.

33:53.966 --> 33:55.232
(Sighing)

33:56.468 --> 33:58.935
Okay, be careful.

34:06.145 --> 34:08.045
- What do you see?
- Derek's wedding.

34:08.047 --> 34:10.880
There's no record of Derek
ever being married.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.114
Who's the lucky bride?

34:16.088 --> 34:18.522
Kirsten: <i> Hold up. We just took a
turn into hot 'n heavy-ville.</i>

34:18.524 --> 34:21.658
<i>Derek and his wife are in the
bedroom and they're not sleeping.</i>

34:22.860 --> 34:25.996
Whoa. That is not his wife.

34:27.366 --> 34:29.433
(Door opens)

34:29.435 --> 34:30.867
Kirsten: <i> Busted!</i>

34:30.869 --> 34:33.029
Derek's wife just caught him
in bed with another woman.

34:35.774 --> 34:38.108
You ruined us with some stranger.

34:39.244 --> 34:40.844
On a stupid website?

34:40.846 --> 34:43.147
Kirsten: <i>The wife is Ellie.</i>

34:43.148 --> 34:45.828
<i>She and Derek were married and he
used Stealaglance to cheat on her.</i>

34:50.121 --> 34:52.856
I should've hacked into your
computer a long time ago.

34:52.858 --> 34:54.578
Cameron: <i>Can you see
their address anywhere?</i>

34:55.127 --> 34:56.760
<i>Where are you now?</i>

34:56.762 --> 34:58.195
At their house. Different day.

35:01.133 --> 35:05.102
<i>Ellie burned everything that reminded her
of Derek and left it for him to find.</i>

35:12.945 --> 35:15.312
1477 16th street.

35:15.314 --> 35:16.546
Looking...

35:16.548 --> 35:18.048
<i>I'm bouncing.</i>

35:23.155 --> 35:24.387
- Well?
- Well...

35:24.389 --> 35:26.123
According to property records,

35:26.125 --> 35:28.325
the house is currently
owned by a Lorna Beliansky.

35:28.327 --> 35:30.994
Let me guess, no record of Derek
or Ellie ever living there?

35:30.996 --> 35:32.062
None!

35:32.064 --> 35:33.663
Well, maybe Lorna has some answers.

35:35.167 --> 35:37.334
Thank you for coming, Mrs. Beliansky.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.802
Are you sure I don't need a lawyer?

35:38.804 --> 35:41.138
You're not in any
trouble Mrs. Beliansky.

35:41.140 --> 35:43.740
Then why did you being me
here in a windowless van?

35:43.742 --> 35:45.142
It's just something we do.

35:45.144 --> 35:47.978
Agent goodkin and I
are looking for information

35:47.980 --> 35:49.646
on the previous owners of your house.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.081
Derek and Ellie Steelman.

35:51.083 --> 35:53.116
Gosh, I never met them.

35:53.118 --> 35:54.684
(Cell phone vibrating)

35:58.357 --> 36:00.357
- I have to take this.
- But...

36:06.131 --> 36:07.464
Hello, Ellie.

36:07.466 --> 36:09.699
Where did you go with Mrs. Beliansky?

36:09.701 --> 36:12.269
You seem to be someplace
off the usual cell network.

36:12.271 --> 36:14.804
We took her into my
secret underground lair.

36:14.806 --> 36:18.175
Ooh. I'd love to see that sometime.

36:18.177 --> 36:20.210
I'll give you the address
and you can come over.

36:20.212 --> 36:23.346
Walking into a trap
is your thing, not mine.

36:23.348 --> 36:27.217
The neighbors told me they got divorced,
but I'm not sure if that was before

36:27.219 --> 36:30.120
or after her accident.

36:30.122 --> 36:31.321
What accident?

36:31.323 --> 36:33.356
Tell me something.

36:33.358 --> 36:36.626
Did you feel better
after you murdered Derek?

36:36.628 --> 36:39.462
<i>Did killing your husband serve justice?</i>

36:39.464 --> 36:40.964
Ex-husband.

36:40.966 --> 36:44.367
No, wait! I'm curious, how does someone,

36:44.369 --> 36:48.238
even as good as you, find all that time

36:48.240 --> 36:51.208
to plan what you did? It must
have taken weeks, months.

36:51.210 --> 36:52.842
Fourteen months.

36:52.844 --> 36:54.578
Well, here's my guess,

36:54.580 --> 36:59.249
you had all that time because
you have nothing else to do

36:59.251 --> 37:01.818
<i>and no-one else to do it with.</i>

37:01.820 --> 37:04.254
You're all alone.

37:04.256 --> 37:06.856
That's why you keep calling me
because you want somebody

37:06.858 --> 37:09.726
<i>to make you feel like you're
still worth talking to.</i>

37:11.396 --> 37:13.863
(Line disconnects)

37:13.865 --> 37:16.933
Okay, so the day Ellie broke up
with Derek, she rolled her car off

37:16.935 --> 37:18.368
the side of the pacific coast highway.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.904
So three years ago there was
a single accident like that.

37:20.906 --> 37:24.341
A woman named Linda Edwards rolled
her SUV off the side of PCH.

37:24.343 --> 37:27.410
Linda Edwards. L.E.

37:27.412 --> 37:29.112
- "Ellie."
- Yeah.

37:31.516 --> 37:33.350
Linus: Ellie can't be Linda Edwards.

37:33.352 --> 37:34.417
No, she has to be!

37:34.419 --> 37:36.119
But she can't be.

37:36.121 --> 37:38.455
Linda Edwards died three years ago
in UC Santa Monica medical center.

37:38.457 --> 37:40.790
No, it's the only
thing that makes sense.

37:40.792 --> 37:43.426
- What makes sense?
- You should be home, resting.

37:43.428 --> 37:44.894
That's what I tried to tell him.

37:44.896 --> 37:46.730
I'll rest when I'm dead and buried.

37:46.732 --> 37:49.899
Medical records show
that Linda Edwards died

37:49.901 --> 37:52.402
from her neck injuries
suffered in the accident.

37:52.404 --> 37:54.304
So we're back to nowhere again?

37:54.306 --> 37:56.406
Dude, Fisher, you're a genius.

37:56.408 --> 38:00.610
Linda Edwards was...
is an expert hacker.

38:00.612 --> 38:03.313
I mean, they are hackers are
all over the web, buried.

38:03.315 --> 38:04.581
They don't leave an obvious footprint.

38:04.583 --> 38:06.182
So what if Linda Edwards didn't die

38:06.184 --> 38:10.153
but instead stole the hospital records
and the identity of someone who did?

38:10.155 --> 38:11.488
I mean, who would know?

38:11.490 --> 38:13.623
Dude, Cameron, you're a genius.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.292
I totally missed that.

38:15.294 --> 38:18.161
Okay, I'm cross referencing deaths
at UC Santa Monica medical center

38:18.163 --> 38:19.329
with recent bank activity.

38:19.331 --> 38:21.231
- How quickly can a quantum computer...
- Got it!

38:21.233 --> 38:22.499
That quickly.

38:22.501 --> 38:24.134
Three people died at the medical center

38:24.136 --> 38:26.269
the same night Linda
Edwards supposedly did.

38:26.271 --> 38:28.238
- And bank activity?
- Well...

38:28.240 --> 38:31.608
Of the three people who died, Sarah
McGurk sure orders a lot of takeout.

38:31.610 --> 38:33.276
It's Linda. It's gotta be.

38:33.278 --> 38:36.146
Okay, she lives in an apartment building
just a few blocks away from here.

38:36.148 --> 38:39.249
Okay, Kirsten, Cameron, go with Maggie
to the building to pick up Ellie.

38:39.251 --> 38:40.801
Good to have you back, Quincy.

38:40.802 --> 38:42.352
Camille, pull up everything
you can on the building,

38:42.354 --> 38:43.787
floor plans, schematics, access codes.

38:43.789 --> 38:45.255
- I'm on it.
- What about me?

38:45.257 --> 38:46.790
You... get me a donut
and a cup of coffee.

38:46.792 --> 38:48.191
Got it!

38:49.194 --> 38:50.593
I'm back.

39:09.448 --> 39:11.047
Uh, that way!

39:19.524 --> 39:22.292
Linda Edwards? NSA.

39:22.294 --> 39:23.526
Open up.

39:33.372 --> 39:35.372
What is all of this?

39:38.210 --> 39:41.978
She faked everything
except the accident.

39:41.980 --> 39:43.813
I saw a medical transport
van downstairs.

39:43.815 --> 39:46.149
Fisher! Shut down all of
the elevators in the building.

39:46.151 --> 39:47.317
On it!

39:50.589 --> 39:52.589
Everybody, please stand back!

39:54.826 --> 39:56.359
Fisher, we're in position.

39:56.361 --> 39:57.594
Release the Kraken.

40:02.868 --> 40:04.134
Hello, Linda.

40:05.604 --> 40:07.237
Hello, Kirsten.

40:16.548 --> 40:18.882
I heard you won't talk to anyone but me.

40:18.884 --> 40:21.217
Why didn't you tell me
you were with the NSA?

40:21.219 --> 40:23.553
I thought you knew everything about me.

40:23.555 --> 40:24.754
Apparently not.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.361
How did you find me?

40:31.363 --> 40:33.396
You knew things only Derek knew.

40:33.398 --> 40:34.764
I played the game to win.

40:36.468 --> 40:38.368
And you played it for a
whole different reason.

40:38.370 --> 40:40.703
You let your emotions get in
the way of your reasoning.

40:40.705 --> 40:42.572
You wanted a friend.

40:42.574 --> 40:44.607
I didn't find a friend, did I?

40:46.211 --> 40:47.377
No.

40:49.080 --> 40:52.182
Do you know how many times Derek came
to the hospital after my accident?

40:55.287 --> 40:56.653
Zero.

40:57.923 --> 40:59.189
Nobody came.

41:01.126 --> 41:05.161
Every friend I ever had
either betrayed me or left.

41:05.163 --> 41:06.729
I'm sorry.

41:09.067 --> 41:11.167
But I'm told you're going
to get the help you need.

41:13.305 --> 41:15.638
Ah! Really now?

41:17.275 --> 41:18.908
How did you beat me?

41:18.910 --> 41:21.344
I cheated.

41:21.346 --> 41:23.780
I have access to technology
that gave me an advantage.

41:23.782 --> 41:25.582
That wasn't it.

41:27.519 --> 41:30.520
You found me because I didn't
really want to disappear.

41:43.635 --> 41:45.768
Let's say I was trying
to find someone who did

41:45.770 --> 41:47.604
want to disappear.

41:47.606 --> 41:49.172
How would I do that?

41:51.009 --> 41:52.542
Your father?
