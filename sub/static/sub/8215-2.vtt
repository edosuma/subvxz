WEBVTT

00:01.430 --> 00:02.988
*

00:10.070 --> 00:11.207
I love it!

00:18.080 --> 00:20.048
It's over there. Let's go.

00:27.090 --> 00:28.079
You should try one.

00:42.870 --> 00:45.065
*

00:53.720 --> 00:55.119
MAN:
Oh, my gosh, look!

00:55.150 --> 00:57.380
That's that boxer,
Johnny D'Amato!

00:59.360 --> 01:01.282
WOMAN:
Someone, call 911!

01:01.320 --> 01:03.185
Somebody help him! Johnny!
MAN: Call 911!

01:03.230 --> 01:06.222
*

01:10.700 --> 01:12.167
MAN:
25 bucks is a steal.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.792
I mean, look at the set list.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.434
You get "Nobody Weird Like Me,"
"Subway to Venus,"

01:16.470 --> 01:18.802
"Hollywood," "Higher Ground,"
"Out in LA."

01:18.840 --> 01:21.536
I mean, come on, it's a piece
of Chili Pepper history.

01:21.580 --> 01:24.606
Recorded in town
over at the 7 Club.

01:24.650 --> 01:26.777
No. It wasn't.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.344
I was at that show.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.245
Saturday, July 21, 1990.

01:30.290 --> 01:32.315
First time I wore Doc Martens.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.418
And the set list was,

01:33.460 --> 01:35.109
"Pretty Little Ditty,"
"Out in LA,"

01:35.160 --> 01:36.787
"Higher Ground,"
"Knock Me Down," "Backwoods,"

01:36.830 --> 01:39.298
"Nobody Weird Like Me,"
and the encore was

01:39.330 --> 01:42.561
a particularly awesome
cover of "Dr. Funkenstein."

01:42.600 --> 01:44.227
That is nothing more
than a mix tape,

01:44.270 --> 01:45.498
not worth more than a dollar.

01:45.530 --> 01:47.191
You calling me a fraud?

01:47.240 --> 01:48.798
Yeah.

01:48.840 --> 01:50.467
Oh, either that, or you're
a total amateur. You choose.

01:50.510 --> 01:52.808
Hey, Al. On my way.

01:54.340 --> 01:56.399
Hey.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.599
What's going on?

01:57.650 --> 01:59.345
Vic's Johnny D'Amato.

01:59.380 --> 02:00.574
The boxer?

02:00.620 --> 02:02.884
Yeah. Are you a fan?

02:02.920 --> 02:04.239
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentleman,

02:04.290 --> 02:06.315
Johnny D'Amato,
aka "The Face..."

02:06.360 --> 02:10.148
Yeah. I-I just sat a
few rows away from him

02:10.190 --> 02:11.748
recently at the
Pacquiao fight.

02:11.790 --> 02:13.428
You were at that fight?
Yeah.

02:13.460 --> 02:14.859
With who?

02:14.900 --> 02:16.629
Uh, Frank-- Francis.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.194
Oh, Francis.
Yeah.

02:18.230 --> 02:19.663
Mr. Secret Service Guy.

02:19.700 --> 02:21.258
Mr. Secret
Service Guy, yep.

02:21.300 --> 02:22.369
For someone who
protects the preSIdent,

02:22.410 --> 02:24.708
he seems to be spending
a lot of time in New York.

02:24.740 --> 02:27.300
Well, you know,
New York has a lot of...

02:27.340 --> 02:29.308
secrets that need servicing.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.306
Uh-huh.
Hey, guys.

02:31.350 --> 02:33.614
So, Johnny was the guest of
honor at the festival this year.

02:33.650 --> 02:36.346
He was supposed to sign
autographs at 2:00 p.m.,

02:36.390 --> 02:37.789
right after
the grand procession.

02:37.820 --> 02:40.516
But instead,
he showed up at 2:15...

02:40.560 --> 02:42.721
looking like this.
What about a canvass?

02:42.760 --> 02:45.479
Um, UNI's did an initial sweep
before we got here.

02:45.530 --> 02:47.350
They didn't find anything.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.150
AL:
So, Johnny dropped here,

02:48.200 --> 02:49.724
but this isn't
where he was attacked?

02:49.770 --> 02:51.692
Any idea where
the primary crime scene is?

02:51.730 --> 02:54.335
MURRAY: Nope. CSU couldn't
track the blood trail

02:54.370 --> 02:55.632
much further
than a few yards.

02:55.670 --> 02:57.934
Too much foot traffic
from the festival.

02:57.970 --> 02:58.902
AL:
Anything else?

02:58.940 --> 03:00.271
MURRAY:
The last thing I have

03:00.310 --> 03:02.346
is from Johnny's driver,
Moses Perriman.

03:02.380 --> 03:05.440
Mr. Perriman says he picked up
Johnny at his loft on Church,

03:05.480 --> 03:06.879
and then dropped him
at the corner of

03:06.920 --> 03:08.717
Broadway and Walker
at 1300 hours.

03:08.750 --> 03:10.945
That's at least
ten blocks from here.

03:10.990 --> 03:12.457
Driver know where
Johnny was headed?

03:12.490 --> 03:14.412
No, but as far as
I can tell,

03:14.460 --> 03:16.348
Moses was the last person
to see him alive.

03:16.390 --> 03:19.393
And, yeah, I got Jay
to follow up with him.

03:19.430 --> 03:21.421
All right, pull all the security
footage from this area.

03:21.460 --> 03:22.529
Maybe we'll get luclq.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.479
AL: He sure was a hero
to these folks.

03:32.510 --> 03:35.274
Not if they saw
his last fight.

03:35.310 --> 03:38.507
Word on the street is,
Johnny threw it.

03:38.550 --> 03:40.711
That would piss off
a lot of people.

04:00.440 --> 04:01.998
AL:
So, if Carrie's right

04:02.040 --> 04:03.337
and Johnny threw the fight,

04:03.370 --> 04:05.361
who do we think
that would piss off?

04:05.410 --> 04:06.399
Everybody.

04:06.440 --> 04:07.668
We're talking, managers,

04:07.710 --> 04:09.029
promoters, gamblers,
all of them.

04:09.080 --> 04:10.570
So, let's get
a list together and...

04:10.610 --> 04:12.817
Holy crap, Al.
That's Andre Kade.

04:12.850 --> 04:14.875
The rapper.
You know...

04:14.920 --> 04:17.616
"I know I'm no psychic, but
I know that you like it..."

04:17.650 --> 04:18.685
Okay, stop that.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.051
He's also Johnny's manager,

04:20.090 --> 04:23.287
which puts him
at the top of our list.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.068
Listen, I'm sorry
about the weapons ban.

04:30.100 --> 04:32.295
Ah, E-dawg, you know
I hate having Mr. Parker

04:32.340 --> 04:33.364
have to give up his gun.

04:33.400 --> 04:34.765
Yeah, I can't allow it
in Major Crimes.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.062
I'm sorry, AK.

04:36.100 --> 04:38.432
No, you're gonna be sorry
if it goes missing.

04:38.470 --> 04:40.836
That Beretta 92FS is worth
more than you make in a year.

04:40.880 --> 04:42.302
Luckily, I married rich.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.872
AK, this is

04:44.910 --> 04:45.899
Lieutenant A! Burns.

04:45.950 --> 04:48.316
AK has donated $100,000

04:48.350 --> 04:49.647
to find Johnny's killer.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.840
That's right.
Consider it a bounty.

04:51.890 --> 04:53.812
Dead or alive kind of deal?

04:53.860 --> 04:56.658
No. I mean,
whatever helps.

04:56.690 --> 04:58.419
Johnny was
important to me.

04:58.460 --> 05:00.621
AK's been his manager
for two years.

05:00.660 --> 05:02.662
No, I've been a fan
for even longer.

05:02.700 --> 05:05.021
That kid didn't know
what he had or how to market it.

05:05.070 --> 05:07.595
He was losing millions,
so I reached out.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.335
Who was handling him before?

05:09.370 --> 05:10.359
Nobody.

05:11.540 --> 05:12.507
I mean, he was.

05:12.540 --> 05:14.576
Well, him and that
crusty trainer of his, Casey.

05:14.610 --> 05:16.100
Any idea who'd want Johnny dead

05:16.140 --> 05:18.404
or why anyone
would want to kill him?

05:18.450 --> 05:20.372
AK doesn't know anything.
I've asked him already.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.684
Well, Johnny was
a good guy.

05:22.720 --> 05:23.687
People respected him.

05:23.720 --> 05:26.041
He was a killer in the ring,
but he had a code.

05:26.090 --> 05:28.854
That code include
throwing $10 million bouts?

05:28.890 --> 05:30.949
I heard about that,
but I don't believe it.

05:30.990 --> 05:31.752
Johnny was a true warrior.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.496
All he cared about
was the fight.

05:33.530 --> 05:35.088
No way he dumped it.

05:35.130 --> 05:36.358
Do you need anything
else from me?

05:36.400 --> 05:37.492
No. Thank you, AK.

05:37.530 --> 05:38.599
Where were you this afternoon?

05:39.870 --> 05:41.394
I would've thought
you'd be there

05:41.440 --> 05:42.668
for Johnny at the festival.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.109
Well, I had business in Vegas
over the weekend.

05:44.140 --> 05:46.335
I came over here as soon as
my plane touched down.

05:47.710 --> 05:51.077
All right, so if we're done
with the questions.

05:51.110 --> 05:52.145
You need anything, bro,

05:52.180 --> 05:53.442
call me on my cell.

06:02.160 --> 06:04.128
IIE

06:04.160 --> 06:06.128
We go sailing sometimes.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.128
Those are_ some
very Interesting Circles

06:08.160 --> 06:09.661
you're spinning in, Eliot.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.497
Don't waste your time
being envious of me.

06:11.530 --> 06:14.067
I got the Boxing Commission,
the Italian-American Society

06:14.100 --> 06:15.965
and the world's largest
hip-hop mogul on my ass,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.662
and I haven't had_
my afternoon cappuccmo.

06:18.710 --> 06:20.405
Find the guy who wanted
this kid killed.

06:20.440 --> 06:21.771
Please and thank you.

06:26.980 --> 06:28.948
Oh, what a shame.

06:28.980 --> 06:31.517
I used to love to
watch him move.

06:31.550 --> 06:33.450
You were a fan, too?

06:33.490 --> 06:36.527
Oh, I've been a devotee of
the sweet science for years.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.448
I used to moonlight
as the on-call doctor

06:38.490 --> 06:41.527
for the Golden Gloves when I
was a resident at Beth Israel.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.118
Joe Frazier once
sent me flowers

06:43.170 --> 06:47.095
for resetting his nose
in the middle of a match.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.994
I still miss it.

06:49.040 --> 06:52.498
How does a world champion boxer
end up like this?

06:52.540 --> 06:53.973
I don't know.

06:54.980 --> 06:56.038
Okay.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.002
Cause of death
was asphyxiation.

06:58.050 --> 06:59.608
He choked on his own blood.

06:59.650 --> 07:01.447
It's pretty
straightforward.

07:01.480 --> 07:02.617
The X-rays are useless--

07:02.650 --> 07:05.642
too many breaks
to figure anything out.

07:05.690 --> 07:08.614
I know you want an ID.
on the weapon,

07:08.660 --> 07:11.481
but right now, all I can
say is he was hit with

07:11.530 --> 07:12.758
something.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.449
How's that for being specific?

07:14.500 --> 07:15.558
Not very.

07:15.600 --> 07:16.624
I'm considering,

07:16.670 --> 07:19.559
because most of the bruising
has a circular shape,

07:19.600 --> 07:22.728
that maybe he was hit
with the end of a metal pipe.

07:22.770 --> 07:24.567
Maybe.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.635
I really won't know for sure
until I boil his head.

07:28.640 --> 07:31.108
Oh, I know it sounds awful
when you say it out loud,

07:31.150 --> 07:32.617
but it's what I got to do.

07:33.820 --> 07:35.776
Oh. Right after
my protein bar.

07:35.820 --> 07:37.811
I'm on a new program.

07:40.860 --> 07:42.987
MURRAY: I finally spoke to
Johnny's mother, Maria.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.827
She was getting ready
for the festival

07:44.860 --> 07:46.521
when some uniforms
broke the news.

07:46.560 --> 07:47.857
She's hysterical.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.596
Says she has no idea who
would do this to her son.

07:50.630 --> 07:52.495
She know anything about Johnny
throwing his last fight?

07:52.540 --> 07:53.734
No. She never
saw his fights,

07:53.770 --> 07:55.067
never wanted to know
anything about them.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.601
And as a mother,
I get it.

07:56.640 --> 07:57.709
Does he have
any other family?

07:57.740 --> 07:59.776
Seems there's a father who's
been out of the picture

07:59.810 --> 08:01.277
for years, lives
in Honolulu.

08:01.310 --> 08:02.868
But there is an
older brother, Bobby.

08:02.910 --> 08:04.901
She know where Bobby
might be?
She didn't.

08:04.950 --> 08:06.542
I checked his apartment
and he wasn't there.

08:06.580 --> 08:08.616
Apparently, he works as a day
laborer around the city.

08:08.650 --> 08:10.584
She doesn't know which
site he's working today.

08:10.620 --> 08:12.656
Track him down,
we got to talk to him.
Yeah.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.813
So, Eliot knows AK?

08:15.860 --> 08:17.680
Sailing buddies.

08:17.730 --> 08:19.948
Wow.
Mm.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.251
Okay, anyways,

08:21.300 --> 08:23.188
I was doing a little research
into Johnny D'Amato,

08:23.230 --> 08:25.528
because I'm more of
a Mixed Martial Arts guy.

08:25.570 --> 08:27.538
AK may not believe
that Johnny took a dive,

08:27.570 --> 08:28.639
but he is in the minority.

08:28.670 --> 08:29.659
Check it out.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.564
Facebook,
Twitter, Tumblr--

08:31.610 --> 08:33.532
they're all saying
the same thing:

08:33.580 --> 08:35.002
something was up
with that fight.

08:35.040 --> 08:36.200
Now, take a look

08:36.240 --> 08:37.070
at round three.

08:44.250 --> 08:46.081
See, Johnny just
drops his gloves.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.610
I mean, come on,
who does that?

08:47.660 --> 08:49.582
Sure doesn't look like
the Johnny D'Amato

08:49.630 --> 08:51.621
I'm used to seeing.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.988
Was he as good
as they say?
Oh, yeah.

08:56.030 --> 08:58.169
He was like the Italian-
American Sugar Ray Leonard.

08:58.200 --> 08:59.599
Oh, you mean,
the lightweight?

08:59.640 --> 09:01.232
Lightweight? Jay,

09:01.270 --> 09:02.737
as a New Yorker,
as a sports fan,

09:02.770 --> 09:04.135
you need to appreciate.

09:04.170 --> 09:05.967
Sugar Ray Leonard
is a legend.

09:06.010 --> 09:08.001
Well, do you appreciate
Anderson "The Spider" Silva?

09:08.040 --> 09:09.644
Or Fedor Emelianenko?

09:09.680 --> 09:10.601
No.
Oh, get out of here.

09:10.650 --> 09:12.345
And they were the greatest
fighters of all time

09:12.380 --> 09:13.779
in my sport,
so we're even.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.014
No, we're not even.

09:15.050 --> 09:16.688
Boxing is an art.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.210
That stuff you watch
is a blood sport.

09:18.250 --> 09:20.218
See, you say that
like it's a bad thing.

09:22.260 --> 09:25.024
So, if Johnny took a dive,
why'd he do it?

09:25.060 --> 09:27.699
Maybe someone ordered him to.

09:27.730 --> 09:29.891
Like somebody owned him.

09:29.930 --> 09:30.897
Could be.

09:30.930 --> 09:33.137
Check with
Organized Crime.

09:33.170 --> 09:35.866
See if you can find a
financial link to anybody

09:35.900 --> 09:37.629
who may have had Johnny
under their thumb.

09:37.670 --> 09:39.638
Go back as far as
you have to.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.476
No problem.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.377
You know who'd be
really pissed off

09:44.410 --> 09:47.072
if Johnny actually
threw that fight?

09:47.120 --> 09:49.918
His trainer,
Casey McGraw.

09:49.950 --> 09:51.349
Makes sense.

09:51.390 --> 09:53.085
In addition to
a couple of battery raps

09:53.120 --> 09:55.213
he had as a teenager,
look what he did to fighters

09:55.260 --> 09:56.386
who didn't give
a hundred percent.

09:56.420 --> 09:57.887
He broke one guy's arm,

09:57.930 --> 09:59.386
cracked five ribs
on somebody else.

09:59.430 --> 10:00.954
I don't even get why
anybody would train with him.

10:01.000 --> 10:01.819
He was the best.

10:01.860 --> 10:04.624
Fighters thought
he was worth the risk.

10:04.670 --> 10:06.661
But you got to wonder
what Casey would do

10:06.700 --> 10:08.736
if one of his greatest fighters
took a dive.

10:17.450 --> 10:20.044
Everybody loved Johnny.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.719
Nobody wanted
to kill him.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.217
Besides that,
I got nothing to say.

10:24.250 --> 10:25.080
Ah, come on.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.953
Casey, we got so much
to talk about.

10:27.990 --> 10:30.754
Yeah

10:30.790 --> 10:31.757
Well, I don't know.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.151
Like Jack Dempsey,

10:34.200 --> 10:35.155
the "Manassa Mauler."

10:35.200 --> 10:36.758
1920, he was the man.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.119
83 fights,

10:38.170 --> 10:39.797
65 wins, 11 draws,

10:39.840 --> 10:41.967
six losses,
one no contest.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.106
And I'm always up for chatting
about Sugar Ray Robinson,

10:45.140 --> 10:46.778
the original
pound-for-pound king.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.944
Look, we just need

10:50.980 --> 10:53.676
a minute of your time.

10:53.720 --> 10:54.971
ForJohnny.

10:58.920 --> 11:00.785
Take a break!

11:02.830 --> 11:04.957
CASEY: All right,
you've seen my sheet.

11:04.990 --> 11:07.322
Cops aren't
my favorite people.

11:07.360 --> 11:09.351
I got five minutes.
What do you want to know?

11:09.400 --> 11:10.958
What happened
to your hand?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.695
I, uh, split a knuckle.

11:12.740 --> 11:13.695
Part of the job.

11:13.740 --> 11:14.991
AL: Where were you
about 1:00 p.m.?

11:15.040 --> 11:16.905
CASEY:
At home.

11:16.940 --> 11:18.407
Can anybody confirm that?

11:18.440 --> 11:19.998
My cat.

11:20.040 --> 11:22.804
All right,
what's this about?

11:22.850 --> 11:23.976
You think I had
something to do with

11:24.010 --> 11:24.999
what happened to Johnny?

11:26.780 --> 11:29.442
Whoever killed Johnny killed me.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.710
Johnny was the best.

11:31.750 --> 11:33.911
He was my best.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.110
Casey, you hear
what people are saying

11:36.160 --> 11:37.457
about Johnny's last fight?

11:37.490 --> 11:41.256
There's no way he threw it.

11:41.300 --> 11:44.792
I saw those knockdowns, Casey.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.024
It-it didn't look good.

11:46.070 --> 11:50.006
Well, he was distracted
that morning, uh...

11:50.040 --> 11:53.407
riled up, but...
not in a good way.

11:53.440 --> 11:55.032
He say what was bothering him?

11:55.080 --> 11:58.004
No. Johnny... kept it
to himself.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.745
He kept quiet most of the time.

11:59.780 --> 12:01.839
He... just kept it inside,
you know?

12:01.880 --> 12:05.179
But there's no way
he took a dive.

12:05.220 --> 12:07.450
It's not how
I trained him.

12:07.490 --> 12:09.219
He-he wouldn't do that.

12:09.260 --> 12:10.454
Not to me.

12:10.490 --> 12:13.994
You were like
a father to him, huh?

12:14.030 --> 12:16.919
I mean, you took care of him
after his father left.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.961
Yeah, him and his brother both.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.764
I mean, they were like
all the kids around here.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.064
But Johnny, he was...

12:24.110 --> 12:26.499
he was different from the rest.

12:26.540 --> 12:29.134
I mean, I knew he had
that special sauce.

12:29.180 --> 12:31.944
And that face.

12:31.980 --> 12:34.972
Oh, forget about it.

12:35.020 --> 12:37.011
He was a star.

12:39.020 --> 12:40.453
I want to show you something.

12:40.490 --> 12:43.152
Okay, just look at this.

12:46.430 --> 12:48.159
You see that?
Yeah.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.497
Johnny was quick as a rabbit.

12:49.530 --> 12:50.519
That's what he was known for,
"the combination."

12:50.570 --> 12:51.923
There's not many people

12:51.970 --> 12:53.835
can finish a combination
with the same hand.

12:56.600 --> 12:59.501
Right hook, left uppercut,
left cross.

12:59.540 --> 13:01.269
That's not bad.

13:01.310 --> 13:04.040
You want to, uh,
pop your hips at the end.

13:04.080 --> 13:05.968
You'd be surprised
the difference it makes.

13:06.010 --> 13:07.272
Yeah?
Yeah.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.275
Ooh!

13:08.320 --> 13:09.844
Oh.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.881
This one's got
the special sauce, too, huh?

13:11.920 --> 13:14.252
Yeah. She's saucy, all right.

13:15.320 --> 13:16.878
Thanks.

13:22.630 --> 13:24.222
Hey, Al.

13:24.270 --> 13:26.067
I've been doing
a little research,

13:26.100 --> 13:27.499
and as a New Yorker
and a sports fan,

13:27.540 --> 13:29.189
I feel obligated to tell you
that your boy,

13:29.240 --> 13:31.834
Sugar Ray Leonard,
lost three times in his career.

13:31.870 --> 13:33.531
What's your point, Jay?
Oh, I'm just saying,
you know...

13:33.580 --> 13:34.535
How many losses
does your guy Silva have?

13:34.580 --> 13:36.844
Well, that's not
really relevant, is it?
Six.

13:36.880 --> 13:39.144
You're not the only one around
here knows how to do research.

13:39.180 --> 13:41.512
Okay, so anyways, this is
what I wanted to show you.

13:41.550 --> 13:44.849
Johnny had some
unusual connections.

13:44.890 --> 13:45.788
You see this lady?

13:45.820 --> 13:47.287
She's been in
tons of photos with Johnny

13:47.320 --> 13:50.881
over the years;
her name is Dafina Dervishi.

13:50.930 --> 13:52.249
Dervishi?

13:52.290 --> 13:53.848
As in Agim
and Edon Dervishi?

13:53.900 --> 13:55.356
Afraid so.

13:55.400 --> 13:58.028
So we're talking Albanian mob.

13:58.070 --> 13:59.958
Yep. And that's not all.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.160
I checked with NCIC;

14:01.200 --> 14:03.259
it turns out, Johnny filed
individual restraining orders

14:03.310 --> 14:05.266
against four members
of the Dervishi family

14:05.310 --> 14:07.039
just three weeks ago.
Why?

14:07.080 --> 14:08.172
Doesn't say.

14:08.210 --> 14:09.507
It's just a standard

14:09.540 --> 14:11.906
"stay 1,500 feet
the hell away from me" kind.

14:11.950 --> 14:14.271
Anyways, let me introduce
you to the family.

14:14.320 --> 14:17.187
Agim, Edon, Megi and Dafina.

14:17.220 --> 14:19.040
Agim's married to Dafina.

14:19.090 --> 14:20.910
Edon is Agim's brother.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.178
And Megi is married to Edon.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.629
Now, I know they don't look it,

14:24.660 --> 14:26.924
but... these folks
are scary as hell.

14:32.700 --> 14:34.668
Way to show off
with Casey back there,

14:34.700 --> 14:36.236
pulling out
all the boxing stats.

14:36.270 --> 14:37.669
Okay, I was not
showing off.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.928
I was engaging
a possible suspect.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.231
Besides, I've always
loved boxing.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.271
Where do you think I got
my sexy right hook?

14:43.310 --> 14:44.675
Oh, the one
you used on me?

14:44.710 --> 14:46.200
I wouldn't describe it
as "sexy."

14:46.250 --> 14:48.912
December, 2001,
Syracuse Christmas party.

14:48.950 --> 14:50.212
I believe_
we were dating,

14:50.250 --> 14:52.013
and you were hitting
on the bartender.

14:52.050 --> 14:53.915
Oh, I was not hitting on her.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.655
I was engaging
a confidential informant.

14:55.690 --> 14:57.988
She was a slut.
What is going on here?

14:58.030 --> 14:58.985
I don't know.

15:06.670 --> 15:07.989
The cops. This is perfect.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.291
Thank you, God.
Come on. Come on.

15:09.340 --> 15:11.205
Frank, keep rolling,
keep rolling, keep rolling.

15:11.240 --> 15:12.969
Hey, hey, hey.
Shut that off.

15:13.010 --> 15:14.079
Hey, you're not my
executive producer.
No, I am not.

15:14.110 --> 15:15.702
I'm the guy who could
lock you up for obstructing.

15:15.740 --> 15:16.707
Shut that off!

15:16.740 --> 15:17.638
Wait-wait-wait-wait.

15:17.680 --> 15:19.375
We were just about to
blow out the candles.

15:19.410 --> 15:21.173
What are you doing?

15:21.220 --> 15:24.041
We're here about the murder
of Johnny D'Amato.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.384
Sure, I knew Johnny;
we all grew up together.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.193
You didn't just
know him though, right?

15:33.230 --> 15:35.425
You subsidized him
before he went pro.

15:35.460 --> 15:36.722
We found a lot of money flowing

15:36.760 --> 15:38.193
from your bank accounts
into Johnny's.

15:38.230 --> 15:40.289
Yeah, I've been helping
Johnny's poor ass out

15:40.340 --> 15:41.568
ever since high school.

15:41.600 --> 15:44.205
Me and my girls,
we all have a cut of him.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.559
It's like a syndicate.

15:45.610 --> 15:47.430
You know, like what they have
with horses,

15:47.480 --> 15:49.004
and, uh, other studs?

15:50.250 --> 15:51.706
Like, you owned him?

15:51.750 --> 15:54.048
No, nobody owned Johnny.
We forgave a debt.

15:54.080 --> 15:56.071
It was like
we were proud of him.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.587
So what were
the restraining orders about?

15:57.620 --> 16:00.316
Our show,
Staten Island Syndicate Wives.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.510
He was pissed off that
we kept taping him-- whatever.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.289
We were exciting enough
without him, aanay.

16:04.330 --> 16:06.525
Besides, Johnny was
kind of a jerk.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.152
You loved him,
but he was a jerk.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.155
Which is it?

16:09.200 --> 16:10.428
Both.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.722
Johnny was a home-wrecker.

16:12.770 --> 16:15.068
He was stepping out
with my slut-bag

16:15.100 --> 16:16.328
sister-in-law
over there.

16:16.370 --> 16:19.066
My brother-in-law, Edon,
is such an idiot.

16:19.110 --> 16:21.032
I told him
he shouldn't marry her.

16:21.080 --> 16:21.978
Anyone who goes shopping

16:22.010 --> 16:23.773
at the Outlet Collection
at Jersey Gardens,

16:23.810 --> 16:25.607
gonna be cheap
in more ways than one.

16:26.710 --> 16:28.041
Megi was cheating with Johnny?

16:28.080 --> 16:29.308
You know this for a fact?

16:29.350 --> 16:30.419
I know she was
cheating with somebody.

16:30.450 --> 16:32.418
She had the hots for Johnny
ever since high school.

16:32.450 --> 16:33.781
It was bound to happen
eventually.

16:33.820 --> 16:36.050
I mean, I love her,

16:36.090 --> 16:38.479
but she's a putane,
which means...

16:38.530 --> 16:39.758
He knows what that means.

16:39.790 --> 16:42.793
Did Edon know about
this theory of yours?

16:42.830 --> 16:45.469
So, you think I let the cat
out of the bag, huh?

16:45.500 --> 16:48.162
That I just set my own
brother

16:48.200 --> 16:51.237
There's no way that I would
even be talking to you

16:51.270 --> 16:54.103
if I didn't know for a fact

16:54.140 --> 16:56.404
that Scorsese over there has
been filming us 24 hours a day,

16:56.440 --> 16:57.805
all week.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.545
And you can
check the tape, so...

16:59.580 --> 17:01.138
You have to pay
for Johnny!

17:05.590 --> 17:07.114
All right, relax.

17:18.770 --> 17:19.623
Bobby!

17:21.170 --> 17:22.068
Bobby D'Amato!

17:23.510 --> 17:26.206
It was them. Johnny's
dead because of them!

17:31.510 --> 17:33.148
They killed Johnny.

17:33.180 --> 17:34.647
All they wanted was
for Johnny to be famous.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.545
But if he hadn't been famous,
he'd still be alive.

17:36.580 --> 17:38.514
Johnny's dead
because of them!

17:38.550 --> 17:39.482
CARRIE:
Bobby,

17:39.520 --> 17:41.715
put the bat down.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.752
They took my brother.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.650
You don't want your mother
to bury two sons

17:47.700 --> 17:48.689
in one week, right?

17:50.400 --> 17:52.618
Put it down.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.602
We've been looking
for you, Bobby.

18:05.650 --> 18:07.208
Where you been?

18:07.250 --> 18:09.343
I don't know.
Nowhere.

18:09.380 --> 18:12.588
I can't believe he's gone.

18:12.620 --> 18:14.178
I can't believe it.

18:14.220 --> 18:15.710
What makes you think

18:15.760 --> 18:17.352
they're involved
in Johnny's death?

18:17.390 --> 18:20.518
Because Johnny told me
he was afraid of them.

18:20.560 --> 18:21.697
Did he say why?

18:21.730 --> 18:23.288
They're connected,
you know that, right?

18:23.330 --> 18:24.524
They're mobbed up

18:24.570 --> 18:25.821
from-from some country--
I don't even know where.

18:25.870 --> 18:27.269
Albania.
It's north of Greece.

18:27.300 --> 18:28.267
BOBBY:
Whatever.

18:28.300 --> 18:29.062
These people, they knew

18:29.100 --> 18:30.533
that Johnny was
gonna make it big,

18:30.570 --> 18:32.231
so they wanted to get him
under their wing.

18:32.270 --> 18:33.532
Taking him out,
paying for stuff.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.605
I wanted to tell him
to stay away,

18:35.640 --> 18:37.141
but what am I gonna do,
you know?

18:37.180 --> 18:38.704
Tell my brother
not to live his dream?

18:38.750 --> 18:40.377
Any specific threats?

18:40.420 --> 18:41.546
Yeah, a couple of months ago.

18:41.580 --> 18:42.672
I don't know what it was about,

18:42.720 --> 18:44.142
but Johnny told me
they wanted him

18:44.190 --> 18:45.543
to do something
that he didn't want to do.

18:45.590 --> 18:48.753
He said he didn't
want me involved.

18:48.790 --> 18:51.725
He said he wanted to...
protect me.

18:54.330 --> 18:55.649
My baby brother.

18:55.700 --> 18:58.521
If only
I'd been there today.

18:58.570 --> 18:59.764
I shouldn't have
gone to work.

18:59.800 --> 19:02.530
I... I needed the money.

19:05.510 --> 19:06.909
Like, ever since
my old man left,

19:06.940 --> 19:09.408
I swore to my mother that
I would take care of Johnny,

19:09.440 --> 19:11.647
I would look out for him.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.545
What am I supposed to say?

19:13.580 --> 19:16.469
How do I face her?

19:17.520 --> 19:19.488
Please...

19:19.520 --> 19:21.488
Please, you got to find
who did this.

19:23.730 --> 19:26.551
Let's get you a ride home.

19:28.900 --> 19:30.891
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

19:32.830 --> 19:35.492
Hey, guys.

19:35.540 --> 19:36.632
Okay, so here's the deal.

19:36.670 --> 19:38.729
I'm getting you all that
Syndicate footage ASAP,

19:38.770 --> 19:41.409
just like you asked, because
I'm all about helping the NYPD.

19:41.440 --> 19:42.407
That's great.

19:42.440 --> 19:43.270
Can I just say

19:43.310 --> 19:45.642
that what happened here,
with the guns

19:45.680 --> 19:47.671
and you and the Albanians
and the guy--

19:47.720 --> 19:49.210
it was amazing.

19:49.250 --> 19:50.342
You both were amazing.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.846
Real American
hero-type stuff.

19:51.890 --> 19:54.757
I just got three words
for you to think about:

19:54.790 --> 19:57.623
Major Crimes NYC.

19:57.660 --> 19:59.719
On TV. On cable.

19:59.760 --> 20:00.988
That's seven words.

20:01.030 --> 20:02.759
Nine, actually.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.665
You don't want to be
cable

20:04.700 --> 20:06.827
Cable famous?

20:06.870 --> 20:08.690
Al?

20:08.740 --> 20:10.628
You're already famous
in my eyes.

20:10.670 --> 20:12.900
Guess that's a no.

20:12.940 --> 20:15.306
Well, you know where I am
if you change your mind.

20:15.340 --> 20:16.329
You're missing out.

20:16.380 --> 20:17.677
We can make
a lot of money.

20:23.520 --> 20:25.511
The depths of the cracks
would indicate to me

20:25.550 --> 20:26.949
that Johnny was
punched to death.

20:26.990 --> 20:28.855
Which is weird.
He's a boxer,

20:28.890 --> 20:30.448
and there are no
defenswe wounds.

20:30.490 --> 20:33.721
His blood alcohol came
back at .13 percent,

20:33.760 --> 20:35.819
there were no drugs
in his body,

20:35.860 --> 20:37.964
so he was conscious at
the time of the attack.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.434
And the alcohol might have
slowed him down, but not enough.

20:40.470 --> 20:42.267
Yeah, yeah. And look.

20:42.300 --> 20:45.667
You see those scratches
around the area of the impact?

20:45.710 --> 20:47.530
That would be
consnstent...

20:47.580 --> 20:48.774
With a heavy ring.

20:50.480 --> 20:52.402
Johnny was really
worked over.

20:52.450 --> 20:55.942
The fact that his lower teeth
were knocked out, to me, says...

20:55.980 --> 20:58.312
BOTH:
Uppercut.

20:58.350 --> 20:59.817
The temporal bone,
shattered.

20:59.850 --> 21:03.320
That could indicate
a right hook.

21:03.360 --> 21:04.782
And these cracks

21:04.830 --> 21:07.048
are very deep,
and that could mean...

21:07.090 --> 21:08.751
Straight left cross.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.495
Exactly.

21:10.530 --> 21:11.622
CASEY:
You see that?

21:11.670 --> 21:12.762
Johnny was quick as a rabbit.

21:12.800 --> 21:15.689
That's what he was known for,
"the combination."

21:15.740 --> 21:19.858
Right hook,
left uppercut, left cross.

21:19.910 --> 21:22.879
Johnny was killed
by his own combination.

21:26.810 --> 21:29.449
No, no, no.
I'm not stirring nothing!

21:29.480 --> 21:30.708
This is my family
you're talking about.

21:30.750 --> 21:31.978
What do you think
I'm supposed to say?!

21:32.020 --> 21:32.987
Gimme. Gimme.

21:33.020 --> 21:33.987
Hey, you .

21:34.020 --> 21:36.352
You tell her

21:36.390 --> 21:38.756
that if she's gonna keep
spreading lies as often

21:38.790 --> 21:40.087
as she spreads
her legs...
Mm-hmm.

21:40.130 --> 21:42.348
...that I'm gonna come
over there and end her.

21:44.130 --> 21:45.461
All right, thank you.

21:45.500 --> 21:46.660
CARRIE:
Hey.

21:46.700 --> 21:47.769
Murray's on her way over
to Gleason's.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.336
I don't like that
split knuckle,

21:49.370 --> 21:51.031
and I don't like his
weak-ass cat alibi.

21:51.070 --> 21:51.832
What's up?

21:51.870 --> 21:54.100
Not my IQ,
since I started watching

21:54.140 --> 21:56.608
the Staten Island
Syndicate Wives footage.

21:56.640 --> 21:59.848
I've gotten to know the real
Dervishis pretty darn well.

21:59.880 --> 22:00.847
Come on,

22:00.880 --> 22:03.781
you look like
a thug, Edon.

22:03.820 --> 22:05.811
Dinner tonight's, like, fancy.

22:05.850 --> 22:07.454
Hey, get that thing
out of my face.

22:07.490 --> 22:08.616
You make me
look like a girl.

22:08.660 --> 22:09.854
I don't make you
look like a girl.

22:09.890 --> 22:11.448
I try to make you
look presentable.

22:11.490 --> 22:12.855
Hey, I am presentable.

22:12.890 --> 22:15.950
Oh. Is that what that whore
down at the bar tells you?

22:16.000 --> 22:17.922
Cuckoo.
That you're
presentable?

22:17.970 --> 22:18.994
You're crazy!
Like some kind of bitch...

22:19.030 --> 22:20.930
Okay. What about their alibis?

22:20.970 --> 22:23.359
Airtight. Want to see
what the family was up to

22:23.410 --> 22:24.809
around Johnny's time of death?

22:27.040 --> 22:28.803
Hey, this is my bedroom.

22:28.840 --> 22:30.569
This is where I sleep
with my wife.

22:34.480 --> 22:35.572
Shut...

22:35.620 --> 22:36.678
I actually looked that up.

22:36.720 --> 22:38.984
You don't want to know
what he's saying, trust me.

22:39.020 --> 22:40.681
You're kidding me with this.

22:40.720 --> 22:42.881
I know, but, you know,
once I started watching it,

22:42.920 --> 22:44.023
I really couldn't stop.

22:44.060 --> 22:45.823
Like the day Agim
got a pedicure.

22:45.860 --> 22:48.590
You got to see it;
it's... pretty funny.

22:49.830 --> 22:52.162
DAFINA: Baby, baby.
Come sit down.

22:52.200 --> 22:54.839
What the...? Eh.

22:54.870 --> 22:57.509
Make it quick;
I have a sandwich.

22:57.540 --> 22:59.132
Baby, you are
gonnaloveit

22:59.170 --> 23:00.876
You deserve
to be pampered.

23:00.910 --> 23:02.901
You are my... mm.
You're such a sweet... mm.

23:02.940 --> 23:04.874
DAFINA: Don't forget his toes,
too, please.

23:04.910 --> 23:06.741
AGIM:
Not the toes, baby.

23:06.780 --> 23:08.748
They're disgusting.

23:08.780 --> 23:09.940
Wait, Jay, stop.
Right there. Go back.

23:12.190 --> 23:13.987
CARRIE:
That girl-- tighten up on her.

23:18.560 --> 23:19.959
CASEY: There's not many people
can throw a combo

23:19.990 --> 23:21.992
finishing with the same hand.

23:22.030 --> 23:25.761
There was a photo of her
in Casey's office.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.791
Does he have _
a granddaughter, a niece,

23:27.840 --> 23:29.831
anything like that?

23:29.870 --> 23:32.930
Yep. A granddaughter,
Anna McGraw.

23:32.970 --> 23:33.971
What's she doing
in this footage?

23:34.010 --> 23:34.977
JAY:
Well, hold on,

23:35.010 --> 23:35.977
there's more of her.

23:36.010 --> 23:37.944
MEGE
Look!

23:37.980 --> 23:41.177
It's a big man
with a little stick.

23:41.220 --> 23:42.812
Hey, you talking
about my husband?!

23:42.850 --> 23:44.010
Huh?!

23:44.050 --> 23:45.881
Huh? Say it again.

23:45.920 --> 23:46.841
AL:
This must've been

23:46.890 --> 23:49.108
before Johnny's
restraining order kicked in.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.856
You know, his mom said
he wasn't seeing anybody.

23:51.890 --> 23:52.982
Well, she was wrong.

23:53.030 --> 23:56.750
They're in a relationship,
all right.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.791
But I can tell you
something else:

23:58.830 --> 24:01.799
the way he's touching her,
I think she's pregnant.

24:04.970 --> 24:06.733
D-Do you have
an address for her?

24:10.140 --> 24:12.040
JAY:
Yep. 251 Walker Street.

24:12.080 --> 24:15.049
Okay, that is one block
from where Johnny's driver

24:15.080 --> 24:16.115
dropped him off.

24:16.150 --> 24:18.948
That's where Johnny stopped
before the festival.

24:18.990 --> 24:20.810
Maybe Casey was there, found out
about the relationship,

24:20.860 --> 24:22.054
about the pregnancy.

24:22.090 --> 24:23.819
Casey's a pretty
traditional guy.

24:23.860 --> 24:24.781
She just graduated
from college.

24:24.830 --> 24:26.821
I'm guessing he didn't
like the situation.

24:26.860 --> 24:28.225
Sounds like motive to me.

24:28.260 --> 24:29.955
CARRIE:
No. I saw Casey's face.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.661
How he felt
aboutJohnny.

24:31.700 --> 24:33.497
I'm not buying it.
All right.

24:33.540 --> 24:34.666
Murray,

24:34.700 --> 24:35.860
you got eyes on Casey?

24:35.900 --> 24:36.867
Almost.

24:36.900 --> 24:37.901
Good.

24:37.940 --> 24:39.100
We're gonna need you
to bring him in.

24:39.140 --> 24:41.677
Sorry, Al.

24:41.710 --> 24:43.109
Casey's not going anywhere.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.970
He's dead.

24:59.890 --> 25:01.892
Not really sure
what this was about

25:01.930 --> 25:03.056
if it wasn't personal.

25:03.100 --> 25:04.727
There's no sign
of a forced entry.

25:04.770 --> 25:05.964
No struggle.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.558
The safe
was left untouched.

25:07.600 --> 25:09.090
So this was
an execution.

25:09.140 --> 25:11.233
Connected to
Johnny's murder?

25:11.270 --> 25:13.033
You know how I feel
about coincidences.

25:13.070 --> 25:14.276
Yeah,
you're not a fan.

25:14.310 --> 25:16.676
Right.

25:16.710 --> 25:18.246
Get me a list
of everybody who's been

25:18.280 --> 25:20.817
in and out of the building
in the last 24 hours.

25:20.850 --> 25:22.670
You got it.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.089
Anna.

25:26.120 --> 25:28.259
Thank you
for coming down.

25:28.290 --> 25:31.282
ANNA:
What's happening?

25:31.330 --> 25:33.127
Why is everybody dying?

25:33.160 --> 25:34.593
I know this is hard.

25:34.630 --> 25:37.667
Losing your grandfather...

25:37.700 --> 25:39.190
and losing Johnny.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.299
You knew about
me and Johnny?

25:45.870 --> 25:46.905
Anna,

25:46.940 --> 25:50.068
is there anybody you know...

25:50.110 --> 25:52.101
who would want
to hurt your grandfather?

25:52.150 --> 25:54.141
No.

25:54.180 --> 25:55.374
Everybody loved him.

25:55.420 --> 25:59.049
He was like a father to half
the kids in the neighborhood.

25:59.090 --> 26:00.648
He...

26:00.690 --> 26:03.727
had such a good heart.

26:05.760 --> 26:07.182
What about Johnny?

26:07.230 --> 26:10.893
No.

26:10.930 --> 26:13.694
I mean, I-I don't
know other fighters.

26:13.740 --> 26:17.062
I never saw that
side of him, the...

26:17.100 --> 26:19.705
the killer they said he was
in the ring.

26:19.740 --> 26:23.904
With me... he was gentle.

26:26.210 --> 26:29.316
He was the father of your child.

26:31.020 --> 26:33.011
But I lost the baby.

26:35.420 --> 26:37.684
Six weeks ago.

26:37.730 --> 26:38.924
Sunday.

26:40.960 --> 26:42.996
Sorry to hear that.

26:44.770 --> 26:47.193
But when I told him,
he was so sweet.

26:49.440 --> 26:54.309
He said it made him...
understand what was important.

26:57.240 --> 26:59.208
He was gonna quit boxing.

26:59.250 --> 27:01.844
Open a gym with my grandfather.

27:01.880 --> 27:04.348
They were celebrating

27:04.390 --> 27:06.381
that morning.

27:06.420 --> 27:09.856
Right before Johnny died.

27:13.330 --> 27:14.797
We were gonna tell
my grandfather

27:14.830 --> 27:18.129
that we were together.

27:18.170 --> 27:19.922
And that we were
gonna get married.

27:23.340 --> 27:26.366
We were gonna try again.

27:26.410 --> 27:28.776
To start a family.

27:36.920 --> 27:38.979
So that's why Johnny
was so distracted

27:39.020 --> 27:40.214
during his last ﬁght.

27:40.250 --> 27:41.956
He just found out
Anna lost the baby.

27:41.990 --> 27:43.958
Poor girl.
Yeah.

27:43.990 --> 27:46.254
So, if Johnny was quitting and
going into business with Casey,

27:46.290 --> 27:48.724
that may give us the link
between the two crimes.

27:48.760 --> 27:51.399
Mm. Well, I followed up
with Bobby's alibi.

27:51.430 --> 27:52.397
Time card shows

27:52.430 --> 27:54.898
he was clocked in
over at Mari-Tan Construction

27:56.900 --> 27:58.299
Okay.
Hmm.

27:58.340 --> 28:01.229
And ballistics came back
on the slug Webster pulled

28:01.280 --> 28:02.304
from Casey's chest.

28:02.340 --> 28:04.001
It was a nine millimeter.

28:04.050 --> 28:07.042
It came from
a Beretta 92FS.

28:07.080 --> 28:10.117
You know who packs
a Beretta 92FS?

28:10.150 --> 28:13.881
AK's bodyguard,
Mr. Parker.

28:17.390 --> 28:19.950
Johnny tell you
he was quitting boxing

28:19.990 --> 28:21.389
and going into business
with Casey?

28:21.430 --> 28:22.920
He did.
And you didn't think

28:22.960 --> 28:25.428
to mention that
back at Major Crimes?
No.

28:25.470 --> 28:27.062
Johnny wanted to quit
the pro circuit

28:27.100 --> 28:28.260
every five minutes.

28:28.300 --> 28:29.267
He called it a circus.

28:29.300 --> 28:30.289
He didn't care
about the money.

28:30.340 --> 28:32.262
CARRIE: You weren't
very fond of Casey, were you?

28:32.310 --> 28:34.403
You did an interview last year,
March 3, for ESPN.

28:34.440 --> 28:35.372
You were quoted as saying,

28:35.410 --> 28:38.004
"Casey was like an old mule
who needed to be

28:38.050 --> 28:39.108
put out to pasture."

28:39.150 --> 28:40.378
Good memory.

28:40.410 --> 28:42.310
I stand by that.
Well, then,

28:42.350 --> 28:44.409
you should be
happy to hear that he's dead;

28:44.450 --> 28:46.247
shot right through
the heart.

28:46.290 --> 28:47.882
Whoa. Uh, not that way.

28:47.920 --> 28:49.785
Not retire permanently.

28:49.820 --> 28:51.026
Really?

28:51.060 --> 28:53.028
Last month, you set up
a $40 million fight

28:53.060 --> 28:54.357
for Johnny in Vegas.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.197
Johnny going into business
with Casey

28:56.230 --> 28:57.219
would've messed that up.

28:57.260 --> 28:59.069
We're supposed to believe
you were cool with that?

28:59.100 --> 29:00.328
Detective,
I've got a lot on my plate.

29:00.370 --> 29:01.997
So if you could
get to the point.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.031
Here's the point:
we think you had

29:04.070 --> 29:05.833
Mr. Parker kill Johnny.

29:05.870 --> 29:07.531
Then you had him kill Casey.
You were in Vegas yesterday,

29:07.570 --> 29:09.777
but we checked
your plane's manifest.

29:09.810 --> 29:11.243
Mr. Parke_r
wasn't on It.

29:11.280 --> 29:12.349
He never left the city.

29:12.380 --> 29:13.347
I think we're done here.

29:13.380 --> 29:15.416
I gave you my time
out of respect for Eliot,

29:15.450 --> 29:17.441
but now...
you can talk to my lavwer.

29:17.480 --> 29:19.186
Okay.

29:19.220 --> 29:20.448
We'll leave.

29:20.490 --> 29:22.253
Right after you give me
the Beretta

29:22.290 --> 29:23.985
on your right hip.

29:24.030 --> 29:25.327
I'm not giving up Bonnie.

29:25.360 --> 29:26.349
KADE:
Don't worry, Mr. Parker.

29:26.390 --> 29:29.052
Bonnie's not going anywhere
without a warrant.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.419
You named your gun "Bonnie."

29:30.460 --> 29:31.461
That's cute.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.368
DAFINA: He was stepping out
with my slut-bag sister-in-law.

29:38.410 --> 29:40.765
Can I ask you a question?

29:42.540 --> 29:46.306
What's it like to kiss
a girl with a lip ring?

29:46.350 --> 29:49.444
A diamond one, no less.

29:49.480 --> 29:53.041
You're the one who's been having
an affair with Megi, aren't you?

29:53.090 --> 29:54.455
That's her in your ad.

29:54.490 --> 29:56.458
I don't care
how famous you are

29:56.490 --> 29:59.379
or how many guns with fancy
names your Mr. Parker has.

29:59.430 --> 30:01.250
What do you think's gonna happen

30:01.300 --> 30:03.393
when an Albanian mobster
finds out

30:03.430 --> 30:05.591
you're sleeping
with his wife?

30:05.630 --> 30:09.259
It would be really bad
for you if that got out.

30:09.300 --> 30:11.564
This one's not too good
at keeping secrets.

30:16.380 --> 30:18.871
Aw, thanks.

30:20.410 --> 30:21.411
Whoa.

30:21.450 --> 30:23.475
Gold plated?

30:23.520 --> 30:26.489
Eliot's not gonna like you
taking Mr. Parker's only gun.

30:26.520 --> 30:28.909
Now, that's not his
only gun, is it?

30:28.960 --> 30:31.155
_ He also has a
registered Desert Eagle

30:31.190 --> 30:32.555
50 caliber, don't you?

30:32.590 --> 30:33.352
AL:
Let me guess,

30:33.390 --> 30:34.994
you call that one
"Clyde," right?

30:36.960 --> 30:38.166
Yeah, Murray.

30:40.130 --> 30:41.597
Really?

30:51.210 --> 30:53.041
So, that gentleman over there

30:53.080 --> 30:54.342
was Dumpster diving
for dinner,

30:54.380 --> 30:55.472
and he found this.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.080
We know whose blood this is?

30:58.120 --> 30:59.542
MURRAY:
Not yet.

30:59.590 --> 31:01.114
The lab's putting
a rush on it.

31:01.160 --> 31:03.412
After we got the call,
CSU came out,

31:03.460 --> 31:05.223
luminoled the area,
and they found blood

31:05.260 --> 31:06.158
on these pallets.

31:06.190 --> 31:07.999
I thought you guys might
want to take a look.

31:08.030 --> 31:09.292
Thanks.

31:18.610 --> 31:21.499
You know, these pallets--
they haven't moved since

31:21.540 --> 31:24.646
we were here yesterday, Al.

31:24.680 --> 31:27.308
Look at the way
they're set up.

31:27.350 --> 31:29.409
Just like a hiding
place, right?

31:40.590 --> 31:43.093
What if he was hiding there
the whole time?

32:05.390 --> 32:07.415
CARRIE: Could've used
our arrival at the scene

32:07.450 --> 32:08.485
as a diversion.

32:08.520 --> 32:11.387
And then walked
right out of here.

32:23.740 --> 32:25.105
Bobby.

32:27.310 --> 32:28.709
Johnny's brother
was here.

32:28.740 --> 32:31.140
He said he wasn't _
anywhere near the festival.

32:31.180 --> 32:33.375
But he lied; I saw him.

32:42.290 --> 32:44.178
Hey, Bobby!

32:44.230 --> 32:46.152
We need to talk to you
for a minute, okay?

32:50.200 --> 32:52.088
Bobby!

32:56.370 --> 32:58.008
I need a 10-85 at
Mari-Tan Construction.

32:58.040 --> 32:59.234
39th and Vernon.

33:22.630 --> 33:24.359
Al! Al!

33:24.400 --> 33:25.992
Behind you!

33:42.250 --> 33:44.241
*

34:02.840 --> 34:05.206
Take it from me, that's
gonna hurt for a while.

34:08.510 --> 34:11.104
You popped your
hips on that one.

34:15.780 --> 34:19.341
We found Johnny's blood
all over your toolbox.

34:19.390 --> 34:22.279
And his championship ring.

34:24.390 --> 34:27.780
He gives you his
championship ring, and you...

34:27.830 --> 34:29.320
kill him with it.

34:34.800 --> 34:37.837
I got to say, you impressed me.

34:37.870 --> 34:39.861
The stunt you pulled
at the Dervishis',

34:39.910 --> 34:41.571
where you showed up
and accused them

34:41.610 --> 34:43.168
on camera, and then...

34:43.210 --> 34:45.508
you get a co-worker
to punch your time card for you,

34:45.550 --> 34:46.744
so your alibi is golden.

34:46.780 --> 34:49.248
I mean,
you're a smart guy, Bobby.

34:51.220 --> 34:53.745
I don't know what
you're talking about.

34:55.790 --> 34:57.655
Johnny was supporting you,
wasn't he?

34:57.690 --> 35:00.625
Which is... which is
what a brother should do.

35:00.660 --> 35:03.128
But it's weird, because
we looked into his financials,

35:03.160 --> 35:04.593
and about a month ago,

35:04.630 --> 35:09.135
the checks he was
sending you-- they stopped.

35:09.170 --> 35:11.764
He was cutting you off,
wasn't he?

35:11.810 --> 35:14.506
Yeah.

35:14.540 --> 35:16.804
Yeah, I begged him.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.899
I told him I just needed
a little more time

35:18.950 --> 35:21.919
to get on my feet.

35:21.950 --> 35:23.679
But he said no.

35:23.720 --> 35:28.180
You begged you brother for help,
and he said no?

35:30.220 --> 35:32.552
Look, that's why
I went to the festival--

35:32.590 --> 35:34.729
to-to talk with him.

35:34.760 --> 35:38.218
But he wouldn't listen.

35:38.270 --> 35:40.329
So I hit him.

35:40.370 --> 35:43.464
And he didn't
hit you back, did he?

35:43.500 --> 35:44.831
No, no.

35:44.870 --> 35:47.304
And I'm thinking, "What?

35:47.340 --> 35:48.898
What, I'm"

35:48.940 --> 35:50.009
Like, my baby
brother thinks

35:50.040 --> 35:52.508
that I'm some kind of schmuck
that he doesn't even

35:52.550 --> 35:54.370
need to put his hands up?
Like I'm nothing?

35:54.420 --> 35:57.617
So you hit him again and again
to get him to hit you back,

35:57.650 --> 36:00.483
to get him to fight.
Right?

36:00.520 --> 36:02.408
I-I don't know. I guess so.

36:02.460 --> 36:04.781
I didn't mean
to kill him.

36:04.830 --> 36:05.888
I'm sorry.

36:05.930 --> 36:08.455
I didn't mean to.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.559
That might not do it.
Doesn't matter.

36:10.600 --> 36:12.329
He was drunk, they're fighting.

36:12.370 --> 36:14.736
Most he gets is manslaughter
for the brother.

36:14.770 --> 36:16.829
And Johnny's a fighter.
Bobby may walk on self-defense.

36:16.870 --> 36:19.407
AL: Which is why we need
to get him for the trainer.

36:19.440 --> 36:21.328
Carrie have enough?

36:21.380 --> 36:23.302
She will.

36:24.950 --> 36:27.271
You know who I met?

36:27.310 --> 36:28.868
Casey.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.740
Your brother's trainer, Casey.

36:30.780 --> 36:33.419
I-I didn't like him.

36:33.450 --> 36:35.259
What did you think of Casey?

36:37.620 --> 36:41.226
You know, I wanted
to train with Casey.

36:41.260 --> 36:42.352
See, I was there first.

36:42.400 --> 36:45.995
I was sweeping up that gym
when I was ten years old.

36:46.030 --> 36:46.860
Wow.

36:46.900 --> 36:49.835
And what then?
He

36:49.870 --> 36:52.361
Yeah. Casey saw Johnny...

36:52.410 --> 36:54.571
it's like I never existed.

36:54.610 --> 36:56.703
And the two of them
just cut you out?

36:56.740 --> 36:57.968
Yeah.

36:58.010 --> 37:00.877
I mean, Casey wouldn't
even let me into the gym

37:00.910 --> 37:03.470
to watch my brother box.

37:03.520 --> 37:05.909
You know those gyms
that-that Johnny and Casey

37:05.950 --> 37:07.713
were gonna
build together?
Yeah.

37:07.750 --> 37:10.719
So, I asked my brother,
IIC

37:10.760 --> 37:13.854
Can I get a piece
of something?"

37:13.890 --> 37:16.552
And before he can
even answer me,

37:16.600 --> 37:18.568
Casey's there saying,
"No. No, no, no.

37:18.600 --> 37:20.568
It-it's time to
cut him off."

37:20.600 --> 37:21.794
That I was a parasite.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.262
He called you
a parasite?

37:23.300 --> 37:26.269
Johnny was your brother,
he was your blood.

37:26.310 --> 37:28.369
Casey was the parasite.

37:28.410 --> 37:30.901
That's right. And he took my
brother right out from under me.

37:30.940 --> 37:32.646
All of this is Casey's fault.

37:32.680 --> 37:34.819
He's the reason you guys
weren't close anymore.

37:34.850 --> 37:36.579
And I'll tell you something,
ifI had a Beretta,

37:36.620 --> 37:38.542
I would've walked up and shot
him through the heart, too.

37:38.590 --> 37:39.943
That's right,
that's why I killed him.

37:39.990 --> 37:41.651
He took everything from me.

37:41.690 --> 37:43.317
Everything!

37:56.570 --> 37:58.663
I never meant to hurt Johnny.

38:03.080 --> 38:05.275
I never meant to hurt Johnny.

38:06.750 --> 38:10.311
I believe you.

38:10.350 --> 38:11.942
I do.

38:30.070 --> 38:31.708
Ah.

38:31.740 --> 38:34.004
Confession whisperer.

38:34.040 --> 38:36.031
That was nicely done.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.877
Especially like
the way you

38:37.910 --> 38:41.710
played the empathy card
with Bobby, drew him out.

38:41.750 --> 38:44.048
Well, that's my version
of a rope-a-dope.

38:45.450 --> 38:47.418
It's a boxing term, Eliot.

38:47.450 --> 38:48.553
Stick to sailing.

38:48.590 --> 38:51.627
Speaking of which,
just to prove

38:51.660 --> 38:53.548
that there's no hard feelings,
AK doubled the money

38:53.590 --> 38:55.353
that he intended
to use for the reward

38:55.400 --> 38:57.652
and he donated it
to the local Boys and Girls Club

38:57.700 --> 38:58.962
in Johnny and Casey's names.

39:00.100 --> 39:03.035
Aw, well, I am sure you will be
at that photo op.

39:03.070 --> 39:06.961
He also donated a case
of his new vodka, Vodka Kade,

39:07.010 --> 39:09.103
to Major Crimes.

39:09.140 --> 39:10.573
Now, that is thoughtful,
because I could use

39:10.610 --> 39:11.941
a drink right now.

39:11.980 --> 39:14.813
I mean, of course, you know,
I couldn't accept it.

39:14.850 --> 39:16.818
It's in your trunk, isn't it?

39:16.850 --> 39:18.681
AL: No, no.
Not his style.

39:18.720 --> 39:20.142
It's at his Hamptons house.

39:20.190 --> 39:23.114
Oh. To which,
by the way...

39:23.160 --> 39:25.788
uh... oh, that's right,

39:25.830 --> 39:27.650
neither of you
are ever invited again.

39:35.800 --> 39:39.736
So... are you actually dating

39:39.770 --> 39:42.898
Mr. Secret Service Guy now?

39:42.940 --> 39:45.408
Define "dating."

39:46.450 --> 39:47.872
Was it five dates?

39:48.920 --> 39:50.979
Define "date."

39:51.020 --> 39:54.478
You know what, you're right.

39:54.520 --> 39:55.885
None of my business.

39:55.920 --> 39:58.081
Next time,

39:58.120 --> 40:00.554
I'm the one
taking you to a fight.

40:00.590 --> 40:02.148
Why wait?

40:02.200 --> 40:03.690
Let's do it right now.

40:03.730 --> 40:05.425
Right here.
Right here?

40:05.470 --> 40:07.461
Right now. Let's do it.

40:07.500 --> 40:08.762
Yeah?

40:08.800 --> 40:10.438
Oh, finally get my rematch, huh?

40:10.470 --> 40:11.767
Let's go.

40:11.810 --> 40:13.163
Yeah. I'm ready for
that right hook this time.

40:13.210 --> 40:14.438
Put them up. Come on.
Come on.

40:14.480 --> 40:16.038
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.900
Come on. Come on.
Come on, right here.

40:17.940 --> 40:19.043
Come on.

40:19.080 --> 40:20.069
Why are you
dancing around like that?

40:20.110 --> 40:20.872
What's wrong with you?
You got to bob and weave.

40:20.910 --> 40:22.616
Show me, come on.
"Bob and weave"?

40:22.650 --> 40:24.618
Put your hands up;
this is a fight.

40:24.650 --> 40:26.140
You know we're just
sparring, right?
