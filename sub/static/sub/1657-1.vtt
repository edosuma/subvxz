00:26.440 --> 00:27.441
<i>Yeah</i>

00:28.280 --> 00:32.365
<i>I want it that way</i>

00:32.439 --> 00:33.601
<i>Tell me why</i>

00:33.720 --> 00:37.281
<i>Ain't nothin' but a heartache</i>

00:37.360 --> 00:38.486
<i>Tell me why</i>

00:38.600 --> 00:42.047
<i>Ain't nothin' but a mistake</i>

00:42.120 --> 00:43.326
<i>Tell me why</i>

00:43.400 --> 00:47.291
<i>I never want to hear you say</i>

00:47.640 --> 00:51.122
<i>want it that way</i>

00:51.320 --> 00:52.920
Don't look at me when
you sing that part.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.202
Feel it!
Ugh.

00:55.360 --> 00:57.931
<i>That way</i>

00:58.600 --> 01:01.331
Man,
that was pretty fun.

01:01.480 --> 01:02.766
What happened, man?

01:02.920 --> 01:05.810
It's not a solo group. I
needed you up there with me.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.048
That's why none of those
kids had solo careers.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.531
I meant us.

01:09.680 --> 01:11.125
What are you
talking about?

01:11.200 --> 01:12.611
Remember when we
first moved here...

01:12.840 --> 01:14.649
and we said if we didn't make
it by the time we were 30...

01:14.840 --> 01:16.046
we would move
back to Ohio?

01:16.200 --> 01:17.804
Remember that?
Yeah.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.724
We're 30 as shit
right now.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.803
And tomorrow you're gonna
sell your game, J.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.964
That's a guarantee, dude.

01:24.120 --> 01:27.329
And also, they're running
my commercial again.

01:27.680 --> 01:29.080
Why would you want
them to run that?

01:29.160 --> 01:30.241
What do you mean?
It's great exposure.

01:30.360 --> 01:31.361
Is it?

01:31.440 --> 01:32.441
I have.

01:32.520 --> 01:34.010
<i>I have.
I have.</i>

01:34.080 --> 01:36.082
Genital herpes.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.885
Dude, I got $11,000
from that commercial.

01:42.080 --> 01:43.650
I've been living
off that for 2 years.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.528
Oh, just go talk to her,
you pussy.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.084
You want me to open for you?
I do not.

01:53.240 --> 01:54.571
I'll be happy
to open for you.

01:54.760 --> 01:56.728
The last girl you had sex
with was 55 years old.

01:56.880 --> 01:58.609
Don't bring Jane
into this, dude.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.884
What was I
supposed to say?

02:01.160 --> 02:03.845
"Hi, I'm a 30-year-old assistant
at a video game company.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.530
"Wanna meet my roommate?"

02:05.880 --> 02:07.689
L.A. doesn't work
like that, dude.

02:16.240 --> 02:17.605
Fucking piece
of shit!

02:18.240 --> 02:20.368
Come on, do not do this
to me right now, bro.

02:22.520 --> 02:23.851
Piece of shit!

02:25.760 --> 02:27.250
What the...!
I hear you, dude!

02:27.360 --> 02:28.486
One second!

02:28.560 --> 02:30.961
I don't need the lights in my face.
I hear you!

02:31.120 --> 02:32.963
Should I reverse into him?
Absolutely not.

02:33.400 --> 02:34.526
Just go!
What?

02:38.560 --> 02:40.927
Oh, no, you gotta
be kidding me.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.920
Oh, dude, it's bad.
That's real damage.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.964
Hey, dude!

02:52.640 --> 02:53.801
Don't touch car.

02:53.880 --> 02:55.609
You hit my car.
Are you kidding me?

02:55.760 --> 02:57.046
Ryan, chill.
I'll get proof.

03:02.480 --> 03:03.561
What the fuck?

03:03.640 --> 03:05.449
You need to watch
who you take picture of.

03:05.600 --> 03:06.640
Don't touch
my friend, man!

03:06.880 --> 03:08.769
What? I said get
away from my friend.

03:13.560 --> 03:14.561
Ryan.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.690
I need your
insurance information.

03:24.840 --> 03:26.080
Hey! Whoa, whoa!

03:26.440 --> 03:27.646
Hey, get their
plates, man!

03:29.680 --> 03:31.603
They don't have plates!
Damn it.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.760
Hey, nobody move. You
guys are all witnesses.

03:38.640 --> 03:39.880
What's up, guys?

03:39.960 --> 03:41.485
How's everybody doing?

03:41.640 --> 03:42.801
Everybody's good?

03:43.160 --> 03:44.889
Cool. Cool. Um...

03:48.320 --> 03:49.810
This...

03:50.000 --> 03:52.287
is a character-driven
action game.

03:52.480 --> 03:54.209
But don't think
of it as a game.

03:54.360 --> 03:57.204
Think of it as
a real life experience.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.203
You are a cop,
put in real life...

03:59.320 --> 04:00.970
Okay, stop. Stop.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.326
Shut that shit off.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.131
Okay.

04:04.880 --> 04:06.848
Spare me
the corny gimmicks.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.684
What's the game about?

04:09.440 --> 04:10.726
Um, it's called "Patrolman."

04:10.880 --> 04:12.041
Patrol-Man. Huh.

04:12.680 --> 04:15.160
I like that. What kind of
superpowers does he have?

04:15.320 --> 04:16.731
Check out
this girl's pussy.

04:16.880 --> 04:20.885
Oh, no, it's a cop, so he doesn't
have any superpowers or anything.

04:21.040 --> 04:22.690
What does he have?

04:22.840 --> 04:25.571
Is he a vampire,
or anything original?

04:25.720 --> 04:27.484
You know
what's original?

04:27.640 --> 04:28.880
Firefighters.

04:28.960 --> 04:31.406
Yes.
Firefighters? Okay.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.686
Who wants to be a cop?

04:32.760 --> 04:34.569
I wanna shoot at cops.
I don't wanna be one.

04:34.640 --> 04:35.801
Good point.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.046
If I can just show
you guys the game.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.121
Cops are actually
really cool.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.361
No, they're not.
Shut up.

04:39.520 --> 04:41.045
You know what's
really cool?

04:41.200 --> 04:42.201
Zombies.

04:42.360 --> 04:45.364
I want you to start working on
"Firefighters versus Zombies."

04:45.520 --> 04:46.885
That's genius.
Boom!

04:47.040 --> 04:49.361
What if it was a war between
firefighters and zombies?

04:49.520 --> 04:50.726
Post-apocalyptic.

04:50.840 --> 04:54.606
Set it in New York City and destroy
Manhattan. Hey. You writing this down?

04:59.200 --> 05:00.770
<i>All right,
we can win this!</i>

05:00.920 --> 05:04.402
Razor-15! 1-4-5! Hut!

05:05.000 --> 05:07.082
1 Mississippi, 2
Mississippi, 3 Mississippi...

05:07.520 --> 05:08.521
I'm open!

05:08.680 --> 05:10.480
5 Mississippi, 6 Mississippi,
<i>7</i> Mississippi...

05:10.600 --> 05:12.045
Come on,
I'm wide open!

05:15.800 --> 05:18.007
<i>Rock you like a hurricane</i>

05:19.240 --> 05:20.605
<i>Are you ready, baby?</i>

05:20.920 --> 05:22.410
<i>Here I am</i>

05:23.440 --> 05:26.444
<i>Rock you like a hurricane</i>

05:26.920 --> 05:28.081
Eat shit, Joey.

05:29.200 --> 05:31.965
<i>Rock you like a hurricane</i>

05:32.400 --> 05:34.164
<i>Here I am</i>

05:34.360 --> 05:35.930
Whoa, ho-ho!

05:36.200 --> 05:37.247
Yes!

05:37.440 --> 05:38.601
This is good.
Everybody, huddle up!

05:38.760 --> 05:41.047
Tommy, you gotta
block a little bit.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.770
Use your heart.
You block like a bitch.

05:42.920 --> 05:43.921
You're a ball hog!

05:44.080 --> 05:45.081
Man up!

05:45.280 --> 05:46.930
Joey, did you
see that shit?

05:47.080 --> 05:48.491
Dude, that shit was tight.
Right?

05:48.640 --> 05:49.721
Shut up, Joey.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.080
Hey, don't tell him
to shut up.

05:51.160 --> 05:52.969
Come on.
We're out of here.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.441
Where are you
guys going?

05:54.600 --> 05:55.931
Home!

05:56.080 --> 05:57.809
What the fuck, Ron?

05:57.880 --> 05:59.450
It is a tie game!

05:59.600 --> 06:02.126
You will not go pro
with that attitude, Ron!

06:02.320 --> 06:03.481
You didn't go pro!

06:03.640 --> 06:05.927
I got injured, man!
What's your excuse?

06:06.080 --> 06:07.923
What do you do
all day, anyway?

06:08.080 --> 06:09.809
What do you do all day?
Hang outwith Ron?

06:09.960 --> 06:10.961
Shut up!

06:11.120 --> 06:12.281
Why don't you
shut up, Ron?

06:12.680 --> 06:13.886
Who is that guy?

06:13.960 --> 06:14.961
Some loser.

06:15.040 --> 06:17.281
He shows up every day and
he thinks he's our coach.

06:17.480 --> 06:20.006
Ron's getting in my
fucking head, dude.

06:22.920 --> 06:24.490
Hello?

06:26.920 --> 06:27.921
Ow!

06:28.320 --> 06:29.651
Why would you do that?

06:29.800 --> 06:31.325
Why'd you hit me
in the face?

06:31.480 --> 06:32.766
You don't jump
out on brothers.

06:32.880 --> 06:34.200
We don't like that,
you know that!

06:34.640 --> 06:36.768
I was just trying to show you
the costume for tonight.

06:36.920 --> 06:38.160
God!

06:39.280 --> 06:40.645
So how did we do today?

06:42.440 --> 06:44.647
They... bought it.

06:44.840 --> 06:46.683
Green light.
Yeah!

06:46.880 --> 06:49.281
Oh, I'm so happy for you!
I knew it! Yeah!

06:49.440 --> 06:51.966
And that's why we're going
to the party tonight in style.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.326
Do you really
wanna do that?

06:53.480 --> 06:55.005
It's gonna be like
a college reunion.

06:55.560 --> 06:56.800
Yes!

06:57.040 --> 06:58.530
I don't know, man.

06:58.680 --> 07:01.160
I mean, they're throwing a costume
party in the middle of June.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.685
That's what the e-vite said.

07:02.840 --> 07:03.841
I don't know.
It doesn't make sense.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.200
I'll tell you
what makes sense.

07:05.520 --> 07:09.491
Us kicking ass and taking names.
We're ghosts.

07:09.840 --> 07:11.080
You look ridiculous.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.690
Then how about those?

07:13.360 --> 07:14.691
My cop stuff?

07:14.840 --> 07:16.171
No.
Why not?

07:16.320 --> 07:18.800
No. Then how about this,
you fucking downer...

07:18.880 --> 07:20.882
Cops or ghosts?
Your choice.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.041
We look ridiculous.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.362
What are you talking about?
We look badass.

07:30.520 --> 07:33.490
I feel like Danny Glover before
he got too old for this shit.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.523
These vests are
really heavy.

07:35.720 --> 07:37.484
Because they're
real bulletproof vests.

07:37.680 --> 07:38.886
They are?
Yeah.

07:39.040 --> 07:40.530
So all this is real?
Everything.

07:40.680 --> 07:41.886
What about the guns?
Are the guns real?

07:42.040 --> 07:43.246
Yeah, but they
don't fire.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.205
What is the point
of that?

07:52.560 --> 07:54.403
The police are here.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.881
You idiot.

07:57.080 --> 07:58.081
Why am I an idiot?

07:58.240 --> 08:01.369
Because this is not a costume
party, it's a masquerade party.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.090
That's the same thing.

08:03.240 --> 08:05.288
Not the same thing.
Not the same thing.

08:05.440 --> 08:06.646
Okay, relax.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.290
Not the same thing.
Where are you going?

08:08.360 --> 08:09.600
Hey, man! Congrats!

08:09.800 --> 08:11.529
Oh, it's Justin!
Hey!

08:11.720 --> 08:14.690
Ryan said you were a big time
video game designer now.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.046
Oh.

08:16.280 --> 08:17.645
I wouldn't say
big time...

08:18.400 --> 08:21.449
but I
definitely work on games.

08:21.640 --> 08:24.246
Come on! He said you just got
done selling some huge game!

08:24.440 --> 08:27.284
What's it called? I'm gonna
tweet that shit out.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.081
Um...

08:31.080 --> 08:32.923
Patrolman versus Zombies...

08:33.080 --> 08:34.650
Patrol-Man
versus Zombies, okay.

08:34.799 --> 08:36.039
Versus Firefighters.

08:36.159 --> 08:37.960
Patrol-Man versus Zombies
versus Firefighters.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.129
Good seeing you.

08:44.720 --> 08:45.960
<i>What</i> a <i>game this has been.</i>

08:46.040 --> 08:48.646
<i>It's been back and
forth the entire game.</i>

08:51.280 --> 08:52.770
<i>Heck of a performance
from this guy...</i>

08:52.920 --> 08:55.241
<i>Senior Quarterback,
Ryan O'Malley...</i>

08:55.400 --> 08:58.131
Hey, who's that
handsome guy?

08:58.440 --> 09:00.966
<i>O'Malley takes the snap,
avoids the blitz.</i>

09:01.120 --> 09:03.851
<i>Nobody's open. O'Malley
is gonna take it himself.</i>

09:04.000 --> 09:06.287
<i>He cuts across the field,
leaving Chandler in the dust.</i>

09:06.480 --> 09:09.131
<i>He's at the twenty.
Two men to beat. Ten.</i>

09:09.280 --> 09:12.124
<i>Five. Touchdown!</i>

09:12.480 --> 09:14.130
<i>He made it! What a run!</i>

09:14.320 --> 09:16.448
<i>O'Malley did it. He made it!</i>

09:16.600 --> 09:17.931
<i>What a run!</i>

09:18.000 --> 09:20.810
<i>Ryan O'Malley has just delivered
one of the greatest...</i>

09:20.960 --> 09:22.485
But I knew I could
beat the outside.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.560
<i>This has been a stellar
performance by O'Malley...</i>

09:27.600 --> 09:29.329
<i>the young player
who we're hoping</i>

09:29.480 --> 09:31.209
<i>to see a lot of
in the future...</i>

09:33.440 --> 09:34.521
O'Malley!

09:34.680 --> 09:37.286
Oh, yeah!

09:37.840 --> 09:40.161
Oh! Everybody's here!
Great to see you guys!

09:40.320 --> 09:41.810
I was just
watching the play.

09:42.480 --> 09:45.006
What happened? We all thought
you would have gone pro.

09:45.160 --> 09:48.323
Yeah, definitely.
You know, with the injury...

09:48.520 --> 09:49.965
Didn't I see you in a
herpes commercial, though?

09:50.120 --> 09:52.248
Yeah, you did!
I killed that, right?

09:52.360 --> 09:53.441
So you're an actor now?

09:53.520 --> 09:56.046
No, they found me
in a mall, dude.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.242
No, I've been
mentoring some kids...

09:58.400 --> 10:00.050
teach some football, the
ins and outs of the game.

10:00.240 --> 10:01.366
How to play it right.

10:01.440 --> 10:03.647
You know, just to give back
to the community.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.325
But what's your job?

10:06.520 --> 10:07.806
Yeah, there's
odds and ends.

10:07.880 --> 10:09.245
I told you I did
that commercial.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.209
No, I mean,
what's your career?

10:12.720 --> 10:14.848
I mean, what do you...

10:16.480 --> 10:19.882
Hey, he's O'Malley, right?
That's his job.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.724
Yeah, man.
Right?

10:21.880 --> 10:23.723
You're out of here? Oh, you
guys are going with him?

10:23.880 --> 10:25.211
Oh, you're all going.

10:26.360 --> 10:29.204
What happened
to that guy?

10:33.560 --> 10:35.050
Ryan.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.565
Wait up.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.721
I didn't sell
my game today.

10:51.280 --> 10:52.930
I know, Justin.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.562
L.A.'s not
for me, dude.

10:58.760 --> 11:00.888
I'm moving back
to Ohio.

11:03.720 --> 11:05.085
Are you all right?

11:07.400 --> 11:09.289
Me too, man.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.445
Me too.

11:21.440 --> 11:23.169
<i>This magic moment</i>

11:26.440 --> 11:29.569
<i>So different and so new</i>

11:29.640 --> 11:32.246
<i>Was like any other</i>

11:35.200 --> 11:37.851
<i>Until I met you</i>

11:38.760 --> 11:40.762
<i>And then it happened</i>

11:40.840 --> 11:43.127
Officer!

11:43.840 --> 11:45.285
Officer!

11:49.000 --> 11:52.243
Scavenger hunt! We all
have to kiss a cop!

11:55.000 --> 11:58.561
<i>Everything I want I have</i>

11:59.680 --> 12:02.809
<i>Whenever I hold you tight</i>

12:04.640 --> 12:07.120
<i>This magic moment</i>

12:08.640 --> 12:09.880
That was different.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.291
Yeah.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.331
Freeze!

12:17.000 --> 12:18.650
You guys
over there, freeze!

12:18.840 --> 12:20.968
Everybody freeze.

12:25.520 --> 12:26.806
What the fuck?

12:26.960 --> 12:28.803
Carry on.
Everybody be safe.

12:29.160 --> 12:30.321
Carry on.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.565
I got my eyes
on you, Jack.

12:32.720 --> 12:33.721
Carry on.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.285
Goodness.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.368
Justin, you've got
to try it.

12:40.880 --> 12:42.245
Police! Freeze!

12:42.320 --> 12:43.321
Oh!

12:43.400 --> 12:44.731
My bad, dude.

12:44.800 --> 12:45.961
Stupid pigs.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.525
Stay in school.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.565
Yep, they think
we're real.

12:50.720 --> 12:52.848
So, let's be cops.

12:55.480 --> 12:57.448
Well-well-well.
What do we have here?

12:58.560 --> 13:00.210
What you got in
your hand there?

13:00.480 --> 13:02.050
Oh, a joint.

13:02.360 --> 13:03.930
Officers, this is...

13:09.520 --> 13:11.488
That's some
really good weed, man.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.764
Is this for real?

13:16.720 --> 13:17.881
Go.

13:22.880 --> 13:25.451
Do not exhale, man. Just keep it in.
Be cool.

13:25.720 --> 13:27.563
Be cool, Justin,
we're good.

13:38.880 --> 13:42.248
Even the cops think
we're cops, Justin.

13:43.080 --> 13:44.081
Yeah!

13:46.240 --> 13:47.287
Hey, look who it is.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.200
Look, dude.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.368
I knew we'd see
these dicks again.

13:51.440 --> 13:52.680
Hey, pull over.

13:52.760 --> 13:53.880
Are you serious?
I'm serious.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.285
They're at Georgie's.
Pull over.

13:56.160 --> 13:59.004
This is not right.
I make my payments.

13:59.160 --> 14:01.731
I don't talk. We have
been here 32 years.

14:01.880 --> 14:04.406
This is my whole life.
This is my family.

14:04.560 --> 14:06.050
Georgie, be smart.

14:06.360 --> 14:09.409
When Mossi admires your
business, you make him partner.

14:09.560 --> 14:11.005
But l never
asked for a partner.

14:11.200 --> 14:13.362
He no your ask permission.

14:13.760 --> 14:15.410
You realize we're
not real cops, right?

14:15.560 --> 14:16.607
Just watch my 6.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.285
Your 6?
My backup.

14:18.440 --> 14:19.646
Don't use the lingo.

14:19.720 --> 14:22.610
Oh, fuck you. I'm using the lingo.
The lingo's half the fun.

14:22.680 --> 14:23.806
Whoo!

14:23.880 --> 14:24.961
We're here.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.607
We got reports
of a 418.

14:27.800 --> 14:31.043
What? Why don't you tell
them what a 418 is?

14:31.120 --> 14:32.963
I don't know.
Tell them.

14:33.320 --> 14:36.164
And I gotta say,
you look suspicious, buddy.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.483
Hands where I can see them.
All of you.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.324
Hands where I can see them!

14:43.360 --> 14:45.010
What's going on
over there? Come on.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.926
Get my 6.
Don't say that.

14:48.480 --> 14:49.527
What the...?

14:50.440 --> 14:54.161
Hey, you two,
get up here. Now.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.211
Do I know you?
You do now.

14:58.360 --> 15:00.328
Everybody outside. Now.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.806
Now!

15:02.000 --> 15:03.240
Outside!

15:05.640 --> 15:08.041
All right, turn around.
Hands against the car.

15:08.440 --> 15:09.520
Now. Hands against the car.

15:10.680 --> 15:11.806
Dude.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.411
Take my photo.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.050
For what?
For Facebook.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.366
Thank you.

15:20.480 --> 15:21.811
All right,
turn around, guys.

15:22.040 --> 15:23.530
Chop chop, guys.
Turn around.

15:24.880 --> 15:28.168
This vehicle was involved in a
hit-and-run the other night.

15:28.720 --> 15:32.327
And the car you hit
was very expensive.

15:33.040 --> 15:37.204
The car was worth anywhere
between $15,000 and $27,000.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.126
27...

15:39.200 --> 15:40.440
$27,000.

15:40.520 --> 15:41.601
Partner...
My bad.

15:41.680 --> 15:44.684
Give them a sobriety test.
I'm gonna 402 the vehicle.

15:44.880 --> 15:46.166
What's a 402?

15:46.360 --> 15:48.249
Search and seizure.

15:50.840 --> 15:52.729
Hey, guys.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.845
How's your
night going?

15:55.720 --> 15:57.210
402.

15:59.040 --> 16:00.929
Hands on
your head, please.

16:03.680 --> 16:05.205
Do a couple of
spins for me.

16:07.760 --> 16:08.886
That's good.

16:09.040 --> 16:10.166
Okay-

16:10.520 --> 16:12.204
You can't drive around...

16:12.880 --> 16:14.928
with bourbon in your...

16:16.000 --> 16:17.081
What else?

16:18.000 --> 16:20.890
Pelvic thrusts. Hands still
up there, pelvic thrusts.

16:21.720 --> 16:23.085
Yeah, like that.

16:23.240 --> 16:24.844
What? What? What?

16:25.560 --> 16:26.561
Ho-ho!

16:27.400 --> 16:28.561
Yeah!

16:28.920 --> 16:30.081
Now...

16:30.680 --> 16:32.250
bust it wide open.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.000
You gotta see what's
going on back there.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.570
What's going on
back there?

16:35.760 --> 16:37.649
Pop that.
Earn that money.

16:37.920 --> 16:39.922
Dance like you just found
out you're pregnant.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.771
That's laundry for a week.
Thank you, gentlemen.

16:48.080 --> 16:49.411
Yeah!

16:52.760 --> 16:54.285
When did you guys
stop dancing?

16:57.760 --> 17:00.411
And that goes there.

17:01.600 --> 17:04.079
Well, I hope we all
learned a lesson here.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.287
Now who are you?

17:05.359 --> 17:06.691
Who are we?

17:07.760 --> 17:09.329
Why don't you tell
these men who we are?

17:09.480 --> 17:11.403
We're the law, bitch.

17:11.560 --> 17:12.971
Yeah!
That was cool, man.

17:13.119 --> 17:14.770
It felt so good.
Yeah!

17:14.920 --> 17:17.445
You heard him.
We're the law, bitch.

17:17.760 --> 17:21.445
We're the new
sheriffs in town. Okay?

17:21.640 --> 17:24.530
Now get in your
car and get out.

17:25.440 --> 17:26.646
Now.

17:29.080 --> 17:31.970
Yeah! All right!

17:41.480 --> 17:42.970
This is what
we needed, buddy.

17:43.160 --> 17:44.525
How far are we planning
on taking this, dude?

17:44.680 --> 17:46.364
Why do you ruin everything
by thinking about it?

17:46.440 --> 17:47.441
Just enjoy the night.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.806
Hey, um...

17:49.120 --> 17:52.169
I'm sorry. I had no idea
that you were a cop.

17:52.320 --> 17:53.321
Oh.

17:53.480 --> 17:55.164
No, I'm not really a cop.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.321
What do you mean?

17:56.400 --> 17:57.890
We're more than cops.

17:57.960 --> 18:00.201
Yeah, we help all
the intense units.

18:00.360 --> 18:01.805
SWAT, FBI.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.162
The other day,
we were on a 5150...

18:04.320 --> 18:07.529
and this guy comes off with
a sawed-off shotgun, right?

18:07.720 --> 18:08.960
Bang, bang, bang!

18:09.160 --> 18:10.161
Dude, what are you...

18:10.320 --> 18:12.163
I look behind me
and J-Rock...

18:12.360 --> 18:15.364
puts one in the chest
and two in the balls.

18:15.560 --> 18:16.971
One in each ball.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.246
Wow, really?

18:18.360 --> 18:19.885
No, I don't
shoot testicles.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.883
Do not let that
humble face fool you.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.964
And we all at the force talk about it.
We think he needs a serious...

18:25.240 --> 18:27.083
back massage.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.001
Okay.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.006
Uh, I'm Josie.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.286
Oh, nice to meet you.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.010
Nice to meet you, too...

18:37.880 --> 18:38.961
Chang.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.247
Oh...

18:40.320 --> 18:42.687
Chang. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.120
Chang, yeah.

18:44.200 --> 18:46.601
That's my name.
It's a family name.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.370
Chang you very much.

18:51.320 --> 18:53.004
That was racist.
I'm sorry.

18:53.160 --> 18:54.400
You're funny.

18:55.880 --> 18:59.601
I'm sure I will see you
around, Officer Chang.

19:00.360 --> 19:02.044
Oh, my lord!

19:02.840 --> 19:03.841
Ooh!

19:06.400 --> 19:08.448
She likes you, Justin.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.125
You do not mess
with the law!

19:11.560 --> 19:13.210
You don't mess with the law!
Yeah, yeah!

19:13.720 --> 19:15.051
Yeah!

19:31.560 --> 19:32.800
We have problem.

19:34.440 --> 19:37.887
Cops stopped us from
getting Georgie to sign.

19:39.240 --> 19:40.810
What kind of cops?

19:41.080 --> 19:42.809
Hie-cops?

19:43.400 --> 19:44.606
Yeah.

19:45.760 --> 19:46.921
Did they buy you
a donut?

19:55.720 --> 19:58.291
Now find me those cops.

20:00.440 --> 20:02.204
<i>Police
hand signals are crucial</i>

20:02.320 --> 20:04.129
<i>in life-threatening
situations.</i>

20:04.280 --> 20:06.681
<i>The most important
hand signal is Code 4.</i>

20:06.960 --> 20:08.644
<i>Code 4 means,
"All clear.</i>

20:08.840 --> 20:10.171
"We're all <i>good</i> here."

20:10.320 --> 20:12.482
Code 4. All clear.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.489

Grand Theft.</i>

20:17.640 --> 20:19.324
<i>What is Code 287?
Kidnapping.</i>

20:19.480 --> 20:20.720
Watch your surroundings.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.404
Control the situation.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.687
<i>Remember the
3 essential steps of self-defense.</i>

20:52.840 --> 20:54.880
Absolutely. It's all the
technique I told you about.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.729
Okay?
Let's may, Joey.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.161
Try to kill me.

20:59.360 --> 21:01.641
You're the bad guy. You're the
crackhead, I'm the cop. Go.

21:01.680 --> 21:04.001
Come at me.
Come at me.

21:08.480 --> 21:10.120
You stabbed me, you son-of-a-bitch!
Sorry.

21:40.640 --> 21:41.880
Whoo!

21:42.240 --> 21:45.050
All right!
What you got going, my dude?

21:45.240 --> 21:48.244
<i>Whatever we want!
We're cops!</i>

21:50.440 --> 21:51.851
Oh, shit.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.560
Oh, shit, dude.
I'm getting pulled over.

21:53.680 --> 21:54.727
<i>Play it cool, Chang.</i>

21:54.880 --> 21:57.531
Play it cool? I can't play it cool.
I'm black!

22:01.360 --> 22:04.443
<i>Turn off the
engine and step out of the car.</i>

22:04.600 --> 22:08.127
Okay. I'm getting out.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.370
Hands on top of your head.

22:10.520 --> 22:12.204
Okay-

22:12.920 --> 22:14.888
Are you
wearing an LAPD uniform?

22:15.040 --> 22:16.610
Officer, I can explain...
Turn around!

22:16.960 --> 22:18.450
Spread your legs.

22:22.160 --> 22:23.525
Don't fight it!

22:23.600 --> 22:25.045
Officer,
what are you doing?

22:26.320 --> 22:27.810
Whoo!
Officer!

22:27.960 --> 22:29.450
I'm gonna ride you!

22:29.600 --> 22:30.840
Oh, my gosh!

22:30.920 --> 22:32.126
What is wrong with you?

22:32.280 --> 22:35.489
You should have
seen your face, man!

22:36.120 --> 22:38.122
Wow. Where did
you get this?

22:38.280 --> 22:39.361
EBay, dude.

22:39.440 --> 22:41.408
EBay? Yeah,
there's tons of them.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.090
Isn't this so illegal?

22:43.240 --> 22:44.401
No.

22:44.920 --> 22:46.604
Well, I mean, yeah.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.165
Putting the lights on
kind of is.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.563
<i>I had to do that myself.</i>

22:50.760 --> 22:52.091
What about the LAPD shit.

22:52.240 --> 22:53.241
Got it online.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.164
Then I went to Kinko's.
Kinko's?

22:56.440 --> 22:57.965
<i>Plastered it on myself.</i>

22:58.120 --> 23:00.441
This is crazy, dude.

23:00.920 --> 23:04.003
Some next level shit
is what it is, Justin.

23:04.160 --> 23:05.969
Some next level shit.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.643
<i>Load it up and crack a trick</i>

23:14.800 --> 23:17.246
<i>I'm above the law, bitch</i>

23:19.680 --> 23:22.650
Isn't that the guy who took
a shit on our doorstep?

23:22.800 --> 23:24.131
He's a cop.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.923
<i>Everybody get down</i>

23:35.680 --> 23:37.080
Officers,
is there a problem?

23:37.160 --> 23:38.685
Do you want to go
to jail tonight?

23:39.160 --> 23:40.161
Um...

24:02.560 --> 24:04.369
There you guys are!

24:04.600 --> 24:05.965
What are you
talking about?

24:06.040 --> 24:08.486
Somewhere fun.

24:10.640 --> 24:12.210
All right!

24:14.200 --> 24:15.326
Oh, yeah!

24:16.360 --> 24:17.486
Damn!

24:17.840 --> 24:20.889
Oh, no, no, no. We're real cops.
These are our guns and...

24:21.040 --> 24:22.690
We paid $500
for your asses.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.400
Now get up there
and shake those dicks!

24:25.680 --> 24:26.886
That's right!

24:27.520 --> 24:29.170
I'm getting
fucked tonight.

24:35.760 --> 24:37.410
Take it off.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.085
Come to mama.

24:39.400 --> 24:40.731
Oh, yeah!

24:40.880 --> 24:43.531
Get your dollar
bills ready, girls.

24:43.680 --> 24:44.841
WOMAN 23 Make it flash!

24:45.040 --> 24:46.690
No touching!

24:47.400 --> 24:48.561
Stop, guys!

24:48.960 --> 24:50.405
Can I just dance?

24:53.160 --> 24:54.730
Ew.
What?

24:54.920 --> 24:56.206
Oh, gosh.

24:56.280 --> 24:58.282
You get
what you pay for.

24:58.400 --> 24:59.686
Ugh.

25:15.440 --> 25:18.762
All right, let's do it again.
Roll up the windows.

25:20.120 --> 25:22.600
Here we go! Here we go!

25:29.760 --> 25:32.411
You look really different
without your uniform.

25:33.120 --> 25:34.929
Is that a compliment
or an insult?

25:35.440 --> 25:36.851
All right,
young lady.

25:36.920 --> 25:38.410
I'm the cop here,
so I'll be asking

25:38.480 --> 25:40.403
the remainder of
the questions, ma'am.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.090
Oh, okay.
First off...

25:43.120 --> 25:44.963
How on earth do you
not have a boyfriend?

25:46.120 --> 25:49.522
Honestly, Justin, I have
the worst taste in men.

25:49.960 --> 25:51.803
Thank you.
No, I mean...

25:52.760 --> 25:54.364
I'm a psycho magnet.
I don't know.

25:54.440 --> 25:55.680
Give me an example.

25:55.760 --> 25:56.966
Okay-

25:57.120 --> 26:00.120
Right now, there's this guy who keeps
coming in to my work and bothering me.

26:00.160 --> 26:03.448
And normally, I would just
tell him to get lost...

26:03.800 --> 26:07.168
but he's like
real deal scary.

26:07.320 --> 26:09.163
Next time this guy
shows up at your work

26:09.240 --> 26:11.004
you tell him
I want his number.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.163
Seriously,
he seems like my type.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.850
Whoa, is that real?

26:18.200 --> 26:19.690
Yeah, it happens sometimes.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.205
I like it.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.011
I like you.

26:27.520 --> 26:30.000
Listen, I gotta
tell you something.

26:30.160 --> 26:31.366
What?

26:31.440 --> 26:33.249
And it's gonna sound crazy.

26:33.360 --> 26:36.489
<i>Officer Chang,
this is the LAPD...</i>

26:36.640 --> 26:40.042
<i>I'm gonna need you to stop creeping
out that girl and get back to work.</i>

26:41.520 --> 26:43.443
All right!

26:45.480 --> 26:46.641
I have to tell her.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.006
She's too good
of a girl, man.

26:48.160 --> 26:50.686
And now she's sitting over here
thinking I'm Denzel in Training Day.

26:50.840 --> 26:52.205
More like Ethan Hawke.

26:53.520 --> 26:54.851
What's that?
What are those?

26:55.000 --> 26:56.001
Oh, this?

26:56.160 --> 26:57.207
You sew those on?

26:57.320 --> 26:58.446
I got promoted
to sergeant.

26:58.520 --> 27:00.010
You promoted yourself?

27:00.160 --> 27:01.207
I feel like
I deserved it.

27:01.360 --> 27:02.691
I don't want you getting
too weird with this.

27:02.840 --> 27:04.205
I'm not getting
too weird, Chang!

27:05.200 --> 27:06.406
Stop calling me Chang.

27:06.600 --> 27:08.329
Look at your nametag.

27:08.520 --> 27:10.045
I would love to
meet the 6-foot-1

27:10.120 --> 27:11.770
Chinese guy that
can fit this outfit.

27:11.920 --> 27:13.763
<i>All units, all
units, we have</i> a <i>2735 in progress...</i>

27:13.920 --> 27:15.081
Stop, I wanna hear this.

27:15.160 --> 27:17.288
<i>A 2735 in progress...</i>

27:17.360 --> 27:19.567
Domestic disturbance.
Sweet. Let's hit that shit.

27:21.880 --> 27:22.881
No. What are you doing?

27:23.040 --> 27:24.405
Yes.
No!

27:24.560 --> 27:25.925
Yes, let's get in the shit.

27:26.120 --> 27:27.531
No!

27:27.760 --> 27:29.000
Don't!

27:29.080 --> 27:30.047
We're getting in the shit!
We're not getting in the shit!

27:30.160 --> 27:31.207
We're getting in the shit! No!

27:31.280 --> 27:32.361
I'm a sergeant!

27:35.280 --> 27:36.850
Oh, I'm gonna
kill you, Justin.

27:36.920 --> 27:38.410
I'm gonna kill you.

27:38.560 --> 27:40.324
<i>Reported
suspects are 3 females,</i>

27:40.400 --> 27:42.050
<i>early 20's,
possibly intoxicated.</i>

27:42.200 --> 27:44.282
Oh, that's how
it's sweet.

27:45.400 --> 27:47.368
Light them cherries up! Whoo!

27:55.560 --> 27:56.607
What if the real
cops come?

27:56.760 --> 27:58.520
Are you kidding? It'll
take at least an hour.

27:58.560 --> 28:00.289
It's a domestic
disturbance call.

28:00.360 --> 28:01.521
How do you
know that?

28:01.600 --> 28:03.602
Would you shut up and
let me do my job here?

28:03.920 --> 28:04.967
Wait, wait, wait.
What?

28:05.160 --> 28:06.366
What's the plan?

28:06.440 --> 28:08.966
The plan is we
control the situation.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.122
That's what the YouTube video said.
YouTube?

28:13.320 --> 28:14.970
Police! Open up!

28:15.120 --> 28:16.451
I'm gonna wait in the car, bro.
Chang!

28:16.600 --> 28:18.443
Get your ass back here right now.
You're my partner...

28:18.600 --> 28:20.284
Thank God you're here!

28:20.480 --> 28:22.130
Oh, yeah,
thank God we are here.

28:22.280 --> 28:24.248
Absolutely. What seems
to be the problem, ma'am?

28:24.400 --> 28:27.244
It's my sorority sisters.
Please hurry and come in.

28:29.120 --> 28:30.451
Sorority sisters.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.165
Oh, I thought you said you were
gonna wait in the car, Chang.

28:32.840 --> 28:33.966
I'm not.

28:34.680 --> 28:35.920
I thought you said you were
gonna wait in the car.

28:36.080 --> 28:37.650
Stand down.
You stand down!

28:37.800 --> 28:40.326
I'm the sergeant, Chang.
I'm going first.

28:43.320 --> 28:44.606
What the hell?

28:44.760 --> 28:46.205
You need
to get out.

28:48.320 --> 28:49.810
Well, I'm out.

28:49.960 --> 28:52.122
Chang. Chang!

28:52.280 --> 28:54.362
We gotta control
the situation.

28:54.520 --> 28:56.602
Are you kidding me?

28:57.320 --> 28:58.970
Hey, hey!
You need to stop!

28:59.120 --> 29:01.009
I'm controlling
the situation!

29:01.160 --> 29:02.525
You need to give me the phone!
You're gonna get your ass whooped!

29:02.680 --> 29:03.727
Help!

29:05.320 --> 29:06.924
I will control
the situation... Ow!

29:07.320 --> 29:08.890
Chang, help!

29:09.480 --> 29:10.641
All right!

29:10.720 --> 29:11.846
Don't touch me!

29:12.000 --> 29:13.001
Calm down, sir!

29:13.160 --> 29:14.321
Excuse me?

29:14.480 --> 29:16.209
That's a ma'am!
Oh.

29:16.560 --> 29:17.561
Oh.

29:17.800 --> 29:20.963
You guys seem like
two classy ladies.

29:21.120 --> 29:22.485
Let's handle this like adults.
Yes.

29:22.640 --> 29:23.971
What is your name?
Precious.

29:24.120 --> 29:25.281
She ain't that precious.
What is your real name?

29:25.360 --> 29:26.441
Precious.

29:26.520 --> 29:27.646
Yeah, but when you were
born, what did your...

29:27.800 --> 29:29.643
Not your gang name
or your stripper name.

29:29.800 --> 29:30.961
Precious.

29:31.240 --> 29:33.561
Ma'am, for the last time,
what is your name?

29:33.720 --> 29:35.006
It's Precious.

29:35.040 --> 29:37.691
Precious, okay, that's cool.
That's a very pretty name.

29:37.880 --> 29:41.043
So Precious, great name, why don't
you tell us what's going on here?

29:41.200 --> 29:44.010
I'll tell you what's going on! She's
trying to get with my man behind my back!

29:44.160 --> 29:47.209
I ain't trying shit!
Her man be texting me!

29:47.360 --> 29:49.362
Hell no!
You're a lying-ass bitch!

29:49.520 --> 29:51.887
You call me a bitch again,
bitch, and see what happens!

29:52.040 --> 29:53.246
Just don't call her
a bitch again, okay?

29:53.400 --> 29:54.606
Here's what we're gonna do.
Give me your phone.

29:54.760 --> 29:55.841
What you doing?
Stop!

29:56.040 --> 29:57.201
I'm gonna go home.

29:57.320 --> 29:59.049
Stop it, we're cops.
Act like it.

29:59.240 --> 30:02.403
I will be reading the part of
D'Andre, the man in question.

30:03.920 --> 30:06.048
JaQuandae!
JaQuandae.

30:06.400 --> 30:07.606
You read JaQuanda.

30:07.680 --> 30:08.886
I'm not gonna do that.

30:09.040 --> 30:10.565
"What are you doing?"

30:10.720 --> 30:11.920
Why do you get
to read the boy?

30:11.960 --> 30:13.086
Justin!

30:13.760 --> 30:15.046
"What are you doing?"

30:16.240 --> 30:17.651
"Eating soup.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.449
"Trying to lose some
weight and stuff."

30:19.600 --> 30:20.726
And I did.

30:21.040 --> 30:23.611
"Girl, you ain't gotta lose
shit." JaQUANDAE: Thank you.

30:23.800 --> 30:25.086
"'Cause you fine
as wine."

30:25.400 --> 30:28.290
"Look, D'Andre, Don't be
texting me again, okay?"

30:28.440 --> 30:29.521
You see?

30:30.560 --> 30:32.722
"Unless you wanna get
them nuts up in my guts."

30:32.880 --> 30:35.087
Oh, that's sex!
That's sex!

30:42.120 --> 30:43.645
You can win this, J!

30:43.800 --> 30:45.211
What are you crazy?

30:45.960 --> 30:47.928
Oh!

30:48.280 --> 30:50.442
I'm sorry!
Oh no, you didn't!

30:52.040 --> 30:53.451
Oh, ho-ho! I felt it!

30:54.960 --> 30:56.405
I felt the squish!

30:56.560 --> 30:58.608
You hit my girl!
Why would you do that?

30:58.960 --> 31:02.123
J, control
the situation!

31:07.560 --> 31:08.607
No!

31:10.120 --> 31:12.566
That's what you get!

31:21.120 --> 31:23.088
Don't even say it.

31:23.240 --> 31:25.083
That's what you get.

31:28.480 --> 31:29.641
Does this hurt?

31:29.720 --> 31:32.041
Ouch. Yeah.

31:32.160 --> 31:33.161
Ooh.
Still hurts.

31:33.240 --> 31:35.686
How many bad guys were there?
Um...

31:36.520 --> 31:40.764
Two, but the little girl,
she could really fight.

31:40.960 --> 31:42.086
She?
What?

31:42.240 --> 31:43.446
You said she.

31:43.520 --> 31:46.364
No, I didn't. Why would I say she?
I fight guys.

31:46.440 --> 31:47.566
Whoa! Whoa.

31:48.520 --> 31:51.205
Okay, now that scares the
shit out of me, for real.

31:51.360 --> 31:52.885
Thank you.
Wow.

31:53.040 --> 31:54.849
It's cool that you're a make-up artist.
That's awesome.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.570
Yeah, trying to be.

31:56.720 --> 31:59.007
What do you mean?
I don't know.

31:59.160 --> 32:02.243
I'm not a make-up artist.
I'm a waitress.

32:02.440 --> 32:04.169
When do I face
reality and just...

32:04.320 --> 32:05.810
You can't give up
on a dream.

32:05.960 --> 32:07.610
Look at all this
work you've done.

32:07.760 --> 32:10.570
That's the last
thing you wanna do.

32:10.880 --> 32:13.120
Or else you're gonna regret
it for the rest of your life.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.001
Yeah, I guess so.

32:15.760 --> 32:18.206
It's pretty insightful
for a badass cop.

32:19.360 --> 32:20.930
Okay, Josie, wait.

32:21.120 --> 32:22.121
Um...

32:23.040 --> 32:24.280
I gotta tell
you something.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.006
This...

32:26.360 --> 32:28.249
This is not me.
It's not.

32:31.760 --> 32:33.888
Josie. Please.

32:34.040 --> 32:35.246
Okay, Josie...

32:35.320 --> 32:38.608
I need to tell you something.
I'm not a cop, okay?

32:38.680 --> 32:39.806
I am a cop.

32:39.880 --> 32:42.770
Holy fuck, I'm a cop!
I'm a motherfucking cop!

32:42.920 --> 32:43.921
Wow.

32:44.360 --> 32:46.203
Wow.
Wait, what?

32:46.440 --> 32:47.885
No, whoa, what I meant
to say is...

32:47.960 --> 32:50.611
I'm not a good cop.
For you, I'm not.

32:51.840 --> 32:52.921
Yeah, put those away.

32:53.080 --> 32:54.525
It's hard
to concentrate.

32:54.960 --> 32:56.883
Oh, my
God, I'm so hot.

32:57.600 --> 32:59.602
Oh, my gosh.
Why didn't you tell me?

33:01.280 --> 33:05.001
Oh, no, no, no. I'm all me.
I like ladies.

33:05.160 --> 33:06.764
I'm a lady's man, baby.

33:06.960 --> 33:08.644
You really need
to stop talking.

33:21.360 --> 33:23.089
I'm so proud
of you, Chang.

33:23.240 --> 33:24.810
We just kissed, dude.

33:24.960 --> 33:26.689
But the next time I see her,
I'm telling her the truth.

33:26.840 --> 33:28.524
But tonight we're going big.

33:28.640 --> 33:29.687
Yeah, man!

33:29.760 --> 33:30.841
<i>Because we're cops</i>

33:31.000 --> 33:32.161
<i>Cops
Cops</i>

33:32.280 --> 33:35.204
<i>Trying to earn a living</i>

33:35.280 --> 33:37.282
Hey, hey,
hey, shut up, actually.

33:37.440 --> 33:38.520
Oh, shit!
We're fine. Relax.

33:38.800 --> 33:39.801
Oh, shit!

33:40.080 --> 33:41.684
Pull over! Fuck!

33:41.840 --> 33:43.046
Oh, damn it.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.281
Shit, we're gonna
go to jail.

33:44.440 --> 33:46.124
I don't wanna go to jail.
I don't wanna braid hair.

33:46.280 --> 33:48.089
They hide cell phones in their butts.
Shut up!

33:48.240 --> 33:50.242
We're not going to jail. Just relax.
This will be interesting.

33:50.400 --> 33:51.890
Here's what we're gonna do. On
the count of 3, I'm gonna bolt.

33:51.960 --> 33:53.166
What?

33:53.280 --> 33:55.089
Let's see if they can catch us.
What are you talking about?

33:55.240 --> 33:56.969
Let me handle this. Don't say a word.
Don't do anything stupid.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.930
You don't do anything stupid.
Don't do anything, Ryan.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.081
Honestly, shut up.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.766
Code 4, we're all clear.
Move on.

34:04.880 --> 34:07.360
You don't have any plates
on your vehicle.

34:07.600 --> 34:09.000
We're not sure
what to make of that.

34:09.040 --> 34:10.451
We were on a 288.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.650
While we were inside,
somebody stole our plates.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.485
Is that right?
Mmm-hmm.

34:16.719 --> 34:19.007
That's right.
So I said, Code four.

34:19.360 --> 34:20.485
Move on.

34:20.560 --> 34:22.880
Oh, shit.
I'm sorry, Sergeant.

34:23.080 --> 34:24.241
I didn't see the stripes.

34:24.400 --> 34:26.641
We've been getting a lot of
calls about stolen cop cars.

34:26.880 --> 34:29.281
I'm Officer Segars,
this is Officer Jackson.

34:29.440 --> 34:31.442
Sorry, Sergeant, we should
have called it in first.

34:32.639 --> 34:34.483
Well, goddamn it, guys!

34:34.639 --> 34:36.920
Don't let it happen again, all right?
That's amateur hour.

34:37.040 --> 34:38.280
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

34:38.400 --> 34:39.639
Look, I don't mean
to scold you.

34:39.679 --> 34:41.284
I was young and
hungry once, too.

34:41.360 --> 34:43.203
I get it.
I'm Officer O'Malley.

34:43.360 --> 34:46.284
This is my best friend
and partner, Officer Chang.

34:46.480 --> 34:48.130
Best friend, huh, and partner?

34:48.679 --> 34:50.967
Oh, l wish I could
say the same.

34:51.120 --> 34:53.168
Listen, I'm kind of
embarrassed about this.

34:53.360 --> 34:55.567
Is there any way I can make it up to you?
We're about to get off.

34:55.719 --> 34:57.848
How about we take you guys out
and buy you a couple of drinks?

34:57.960 --> 34:59.769
Oh...
To a cool cop bar?

35:00.360 --> 35:01.691
Yeah, it's the coolest.

35:01.840 --> 35:03.763
If you're buying, we're drinking.
I don't have any money on me.

35:03.920 --> 35:06.321
Well, yeah,
the first round.

35:06.760 --> 35:09.684
I'm sorry. Unfortunately,
we're a little tired.

35:09.840 --> 35:11.683
We had a long day,
so we're...

35:11.880 --> 35:13.680
I don't know if you
guys got the memo...

35:13.720 --> 35:15.563
but Chang here is
a bit of a whang.

35:18.800 --> 35:21.963
Hey, let me tell you something.
Jackson here is no peach either.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.929
Non-stop donut farts.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.727
Never a dull moment,
am I right, Sarge?

35:30.880 --> 35:32.962
6-Adam-7. We got a Code
30 at Ace Hardware.

35:33.120 --> 35:34.531
Dude, no!

35:34.680 --> 35:35.886
We're Code 6. Let's go.

35:36.040 --> 35:37.485
No, no, no.
What are you doing?

35:37.640 --> 35:39.449
We're getting their six.
No, we're not!

35:47.120 --> 35:48.281
Wanna take the lead
on this, Sarge?

35:48.440 --> 35:50.442
Me? No, you guys
go ahead.

35:50.600 --> 35:54.446
I'm gonna evaluate you guys,
individually and as a team.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.329
Go. We got eyes on you.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.487
Holy shit.

36:06.600 --> 36:07.601
LAPD!

36:08.280 --> 36:10.806
Los Angeles
Police Department!

36:23.480 --> 36:24.766
Shh, shh.

36:28.600 --> 36:30.284
Let's go.
No, no, no.

36:35.720 --> 36:37.563
Don't you crawl.
I'm crawling.

36:37.920 --> 36:38.921
Ow.

36:43.800 --> 36:45.211
What?

36:45.280 --> 36:46.850
What did you do?
I don't know.

36:47.440 --> 36:49.090
Two here.
Okay, great.

36:49.240 --> 36:50.651
Copy that.
What is he saying?

36:50.800 --> 36:52.131
They're going in
from the west perimeter

36:52.200 --> 36:53.531
and we're going to
the east perimeter.

36:53.680 --> 36:55.762
No, we're not going to any perimeter.
Copy that.

36:56.280 --> 36:57.441
Dude, Ryan!

36:57.600 --> 37:00.001
No, no, no!

37:01.000 --> 37:02.445
Your gun's fake.
Let's go.

37:02.520 --> 37:03.885
Shut the fuck up.

37:04.040 --> 37:05.246
Your gun's not real.

37:05.320 --> 37:08.244
Don't touch
a shooter's arm!

37:13.680 --> 37:14.720
Come on,
pig motherfuckers!

37:16.160 --> 37:18.049
Don't call us pigs!
Where did you get that?

37:18.200 --> 37:19.640
You wanna get weird,
let's get weird.

37:19.760 --> 37:21.285
Oh, my God!

37:21.440 --> 37:22.965
Hold on!
Hold it!

37:23.120 --> 37:24.565
Hold it.
Hold it.

37:24.760 --> 37:25.886
Just take off, all right?
We're not gonna chase you.

37:26.040 --> 37:27.041
Stay right here.
We are gonna chase you.

37:27.200 --> 37:28.531
Do not listen to him.

37:28.720 --> 37:29.846
He's an idiot.
He's an idiot.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.445
You can go.
We are police officers.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.324
I promise you
we won't chase you.

37:33.520 --> 37:34.851
I promise we
will chase you,

37:34.920 --> 37:36.968
and I promise I'll
catch you, you rat.

37:37.400 --> 37:39.120
Don't look at him.
I swear to you...

37:39.200 --> 37:41.202
I pinky swear,
we will not chase you.

37:41.440 --> 37:43.522
I pinky swear.
Just touch it.

37:44.440 --> 37:45.487
He almost did it!

37:46.080 --> 37:47.366
Oh, my God.
Okay.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.325
Let me just
get this straight.

37:49.480 --> 37:51.721
Did you just
pinky-swear with a perp?

37:52.640 --> 37:53.801
Yeah.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.490
That's the most embarrassing
thing I've ever lived through!

37:55.640 --> 37:57.921
What are you talking about?
Did you see how strong he was?

37:58.040 --> 37:59.800
He looked like Pacquiao
and Fabio had a baby!

38:03.520 --> 38:05.170
Take him, Sarge,
take him!

38:05.600 --> 38:07.045
Go ahead. This one's all you.
Nope.

38:07.200 --> 38:08.326
Go ahead.
Nope.

38:09.280 --> 38:10.725
You got it, Sarge!
Watch and learn.

38:11.200 --> 38:13.123
<i>I came in like a wrecking ball</i>

38:13.200 --> 38:14.531
Oh, shit!

38:14.960 --> 38:18.407
<i>I never hit so hard at love</i>

38:18.920 --> 38:22.561
<i>All I wanted was
to break your walls</i>

38:22.640 --> 38:24.404
on, my God!

38:24.480 --> 38:27.245
<i>All you ever did
was wreck me</i>

38:27.640 --> 38:28.801
Oh, my God!

38:28.880 --> 38:30.405
<i>Yeah, you, you wreck me</i>

38:36.600 --> 38:37.681
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold, hold, hold.

38:37.840 --> 38:39.251
Let me up!
Let me up!

38:39.320 --> 38:40.606
Come here.
There you go!

38:40.760 --> 38:42.205
Way to go, Chang!

38:43.040 --> 38:44.405
Where is the other guy?

38:44.560 --> 38:45.766
What?

38:46.200 --> 38:47.247
What other guy? What
are you talking about?

38:47.400 --> 38:48.481
The other perp.

38:48.680 --> 38:49.886
I think it was
just that guy.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.962
You pinky swear
about that?

38:52.680 --> 38:54.250
There were 2.
Yeah, 2.

38:55.280 --> 38:56.930
Let's find them
then, guys! Come on!

38:57.080 --> 38:58.684
You take the front, we'll
take the back, all right?

38:58.840 --> 39:00.040
- Yep, absolutely.
- All right.

39:00.160 --> 39:01.400
All right!

39:02.080 --> 39:04.367
Chang. Do not
Tom Cruise run.

39:10.480 --> 39:11.925
Yeah!

39:14.480 --> 39:16.847
Whoo! That is living, man!

39:17.040 --> 39:19.008
I still taste that guy's
sweat in my mouth.

39:19.160 --> 39:21.891
Congratulations. That is
the taste of victory, man.

39:22.040 --> 39:23.485
It's your first
collar, dude.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.563
Dude, that was
way too close.

39:25.960 --> 39:28.804
Seriously. What's the
worst that could happen?

39:40.640 --> 39:42.529
"Simply wearing
a police badge is

39:42.600 --> 39:44.887
"punishable by 1 year
minimum in a federal..."

39:44.960 --> 39:46.121
What the fuck?

39:46.200 --> 39:47.440
"The use of official
police equipment...

39:47.600 --> 39:49.920
"is punishable by up to 2 years
in a federal penitentiary."

39:50.000 --> 39:52.002
"Driving a vehicle with red or
blue lights is punishable...

39:52.200 --> 39:55.886
"by up to 3 years imprisonment
and $200,000 fine."

39:56.640 --> 39:58.802
What about a whole
damn police car?

39:59.160 --> 40:00.764
<i>Everybody get down</i>

40:20.280 --> 40:22.561
Which one of you little pricks
asked me what I do all day?

40:23.600 --> 40:24.931
I'm a cop.

40:26.080 --> 40:27.764
<i>Joey, hop in.</i>

40:27.920 --> 40:29.160
Out of my way.

40:29.360 --> 40:31.966
Take a lap, little boys.

40:35.360 --> 40:36.521
He's a cop, Ron!

40:36.680 --> 40:38.682
He ain't shit!

40:40.840 --> 40:42.444
I love it, man.

40:42.600 --> 40:45.001
Look, you had a great shift.
You keep it up...

40:45.160 --> 40:46.491
and I'll give you
that badge I promised you.

40:46.640 --> 40:48.290
What the hell
have you been doing?

40:48.440 --> 40:50.169
Jesus, you scared
the shit out of me.

40:50.320 --> 40:51.367
And who is this?

40:51.440 --> 40:53.249
It's Joey.
He's our intern.

40:53.400 --> 40:54.845
Ryan, are you insane?

40:54.920 --> 40:56.081
No.

40:56.160 --> 40:57.730
We could go to jail for
years for this shit.

40:57.880 --> 40:59.245
And now you have
a little kid involved?

40:59.400 --> 41:00.686
Who's this bitch?

41:00.840 --> 41:02.520
I will slap that little
afro off your head.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.649
You're good. Dude,
this is it, all right?

41:04.800 --> 41:06.325
Take the uniform off.
We're throwing them away.

41:06.520 --> 41:08.045
We are done. Seriously.

41:08.200 --> 41:10.202
You wanna retire?

41:11.480 --> 41:12.845
Shit.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.286
This is Chang.
You're good.

41:15.440 --> 41:17.204
<i>I need you to come down here
right away. I'm at Georgia's.</i>

41:17.360 --> 41:18.566
Wait. What's wrong, Josie?

41:19.440 --> 41:22.444
Please come down as
soon as you can. Hurry.

41:22.600 --> 41:24.489
Yeah, but just
tell... Hello?

41:24.640 --> 41:26.927
Damn it.
Did you hear that?

41:28.040 --> 41:30.486
Looks like we're coming out
of retirement, homeboy.

41:40.440 --> 41:42.363
We gotta go around back
to surprise them.

41:46.640 --> 41:47.766
All right,
here's what we're gonna do.

41:47.840 --> 41:49.410
I'm gonna bum-rush in, I'm
gonna say my killer line...

41:49.560 --> 41:50.971
then you come in and
repeat everything I said.

41:51.040 --> 41:52.121
No.

41:52.200 --> 41:54.168
Ready, and...

41:54.360 --> 41:57.330
Yippee-ki-yay, bitches!
Everyone down!

42:01.520 --> 42:04.922
Yippee-ki-yay, bitches...
Everyone...

42:16.520 --> 42:18.648
So you're the new
sheriffs in town.

42:19.320 --> 42:23.848
Acting all hard
when I'm not here.

42:26.240 --> 42:27.890
Well, I'm here now.

42:27.960 --> 42:28.961
Huh.

42:34.720 --> 42:37.007
Are you the
new boyfriend?

42:42.240 --> 42:44.527
Can I talk to you
for a second, please?

42:45.480 --> 42:46.970
All right, boyfriend.

42:49.120 --> 42:50.451
All right.

42:50.600 --> 42:52.204
My buddy's
gonna handle this.

42:52.320 --> 42:53.401
Okay?

42:53.480 --> 42:56.324
That's real steel. You
don't mess with the Chang.

42:56.520 --> 42:59.330
Listen, you gotta
leave her alone now.

42:59.480 --> 43:01.440
I'm not even talking to you
like a police officer.

43:01.520 --> 43:04.330
This is just me talking to
you like a regular guy.

43:05.840 --> 43:08.844
So this is you
without a badge?

43:09.000 --> 43:10.729
Yeah. It's just
man-to-man.

43:13.600 --> 43:17.764
Okay, let's backtrack a little bit.
So I'm a cop now...

43:19.360 --> 43:21.362
You did it again. Yep.

43:34.240 --> 43:36.368
You think you can
fuck with my business?

43:36.640 --> 43:38.369
Are you threatening me?

43:38.520 --> 43:39.931
I'm a cop, asshole.

43:40.080 --> 43:41.605
You ain't shit.

43:42.920 --> 43:45.207
What? You wanna jump?

43:45.680 --> 43:47.125
Come on, bitch,
let's go.

43:47.360 --> 43:48.600
Let's do it.

43:48.920 --> 43:50.445
Come on, let's go.

43:51.880 --> 43:53.325
Jump.

43:58.840 --> 44:01.047
You're not
worth the paperwork.

44:05.320 --> 44:08.244
I'm the law here.

44:11.520 --> 44:12.726
Back off...

44:16.320 --> 44:17.924
of everything.

44:18.240 --> 44:20.163
Next time you come
to a call like this...

44:20.720 --> 44:21.881
who knows?

44:23.160 --> 44:24.889
Bullets fly.

44:25.040 --> 44:27.725
Cops get hit all the time.

44:36.120 --> 44:37.246
All right, so we're
just gonna come clean

44:37.360 --> 44:38.407
and tell these
guys everything.

44:38.560 --> 44:40.961
Everything except for the fact that
we've been pretending to be cops.

44:41.120 --> 44:42.406
What? No.

44:42.560 --> 44:43.686
It's called
taking responsibility.

44:43.760 --> 44:44.960
This shit has
gone way too far.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.126
It sounds stupid, man.

44:46.280 --> 44:47.611
It's not stupid.
It is stupid.

44:47.760 --> 44:49.330
It's smart. By
principle, it's stupid.

44:49.480 --> 44:51.403
Justin, you could still stop right now.
Shut up.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.128
Hi. Listen I don't know
where to begin...

44:54.280 --> 44:55.691
I should probably do the
talking here... Shh.

44:55.880 --> 44:58.042
I guess we want to
file a police report.

44:58.200 --> 44:59.884
Mmm-hmm.
What kind of report?

45:00.480 --> 45:03.400
Uh, he and I have been pretending to
be cops for the past couple of weeks.

45:03.440 --> 45:04.601
Excuse me?

45:04.720 --> 45:06.085
It sounds crazy.
Mmm-hmm.

45:06.240 --> 45:07.730
Yeah. it started out
just as fun...

45:07.920 --> 45:09.968
but now we're in a lot of
trouble and we need help.

45:10.120 --> 45:11.121
From real cops.

45:11.240 --> 45:12.924
Hold on a second
there, Angie.

45:13.160 --> 45:14.889
Don't believe
a word these guys say.

45:15.040 --> 45:16.451
Oh, fuck.

45:18.240 --> 45:20.163
These guys are a couple
of real jokers!

45:21.560 --> 45:22.800
Let me guess.

45:22.920 --> 45:25.207
You guys came down here to help
me fill out all that paperwork...

45:25.360 --> 45:27.240
you ditched us with
the other night, am I right?

45:27.280 --> 45:28.361
That's right, yeah.
No.

45:28.440 --> 45:29.566
Good to see you guys again.
Come on back.

45:29.720 --> 45:30.881
We're gonna go back.

45:30.960 --> 45:32.200
This guy is a rascal.

45:32.280 --> 45:33.850
No, I'm being serious.
We're really not cops.

45:34.040 --> 45:35.246
That's not funny.

45:35.400 --> 45:36.731
George Segars, he said
don't worry about it.

45:36.800 --> 45:38.165
Help me. Please!

45:38.320 --> 45:39.367
See you, Angie.

45:39.520 --> 45:41.040
We're not cops.
It's not funny.

45:41.120 --> 45:42.531
His name's
Mossi Kasic.

45:42.680 --> 45:43.841
He's top of the shitlist.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.047
I'm surprised you guys
haven't heard of him.

45:45.200 --> 45:48.090
I deal with guys like this
on a daily basis, Segars.

45:48.240 --> 45:50.561
I hear you, Sarge
but this guy is different.

45:50.720 --> 45:53.291
He runs a crew,
preys on local shop owners...

45:53.440 --> 45:54.646
and immigrants like himself.

45:55.320 --> 45:56.606
He muscles in...

45:56.760 --> 45:58.280
takes co-ownership
of the businesses...

45:58.480 --> 46:00.960
and then uses it for money
laundering and whatnot.

46:02.600 --> 46:03.886
He's an animal.

46:04.920 --> 46:06.206
<i>Hey, beautiful.</i>

46:08.440 --> 46:10.841
<i>You can't reason
with him, can't talk to him.</i>

46:12.120 --> 46:14.327
He loves to fight.
He lives for it.

46:16.640 --> 46:18.369
He's got this crazy temper.

46:18.520 --> 46:19.760
He can snap,
just like that.

46:23.840 --> 46:25.285
It's all right.

46:28.600 --> 46:30.160
He's taken down
some big scores.

46:30.360 --> 46:32.761
Every time we raid his place, though...
nothing.

46:32.920 --> 46:34.410
We can't find
anything on the inside.

46:34.600 --> 46:36.841
I gotta say,
I want this guy bad.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.651
It's good to hear.
I want him bad, too.

46:40.400 --> 46:41.925
I think about it every night.
Me, too.

46:42.080 --> 46:43.605
I just lay awake,
staring at the ceiling...

46:43.760 --> 46:45.842
just thinking about
different ways to nail him.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.570
I'm obsessed with
nailing this dude.

46:47.720 --> 46:50.530
I wanna put him up on the wall,
you know, and just...

46:50.680 --> 46:52.967
"What's my name?"
That's right.

46:55.040 --> 46:56.804
Anyways, that's probably
never gonna happen.

46:57.200 --> 46:59.202
What's going on, guys?

46:59.440 --> 47:01.488
Nothing. We were just
talking about Mossi.

47:02.040 --> 47:04.160
Nobody in the community's
gonna testify against him...

47:04.240 --> 47:05.880
and without hard evidence,
we got nothing.

47:06.240 --> 47:07.730
So why don't we
do surveillance?

47:08.120 --> 47:09.884
Believe me, I'd love to do that, but
it's a little bit above my pay grade.

47:09.960 --> 47:11.200
Right.

47:11.280 --> 47:12.645
However...

47:12.760 --> 47:14.967
between you and me, Sarge...
Everything is.

47:15.120 --> 47:17.202
This station has
a shitload of equipment.

47:17.360 --> 47:19.283
I'm talking about wiretaps,
pinhole cameras,

47:19.360 --> 47:21.203
anything you want,
I can get for you.

47:21.400 --> 47:22.481
I want all of it.

47:22.560 --> 47:23.766
All right.

47:23.840 --> 47:25.001
Let's do it. Yeah!

47:25.160 --> 47:27.040
Hey, Sarge, Brothers in
<i>Blue,</i> should we sing it?

47:27.160 --> 47:29.003
Sing what? It's the academy song.
Come on.

47:29.200 --> 47:30.804
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Fire it up.

47:31.200 --> 47:33.567
<i>Brothers in blue</i>

47:34.520 --> 47:37.410
That's good. This guy
never stops, does he?

47:37.720 --> 47:38.721
There's a police song?

47:38.880 --> 47:41.565
I gotta learn that.
You're a fucking idiot.

47:45.640 --> 47:47.290
We were supposed
to turn ourselves in

47:47.360 --> 47:49.488
and now your
checking out equipment?

47:50.000 --> 47:52.685
Dude, you heard the cop.
It's up to us to get this guy.

47:52.840 --> 47:54.171
He is the devil's nephew.

47:54.320 --> 47:55.606
We're not going
near that guy!

47:56.280 --> 47:57.611
So let me
get this straight.

47:57.760 --> 47:59.410
You finally meet
a girl that you like...

47:59.600 --> 48:02.285
and she likes you, and then
some douchebag comes around...

48:02.800 --> 48:04.370
and says that you
can't be with her...

48:04.520 --> 48:06.568
and your first
thought is to run away?

48:06.760 --> 48:08.410
Yes. He said
he would kill me.

48:08.560 --> 48:10.244
I'm not gonna let
you run away, man.

48:11.480 --> 48:12.811
You know what?

48:12.880 --> 48:13.927
What?

48:14.040 --> 48:15.640
You wanna know
what people say about you?

48:15.680 --> 48:17.808
I know what they say.

48:18.680 --> 48:22.730
But l haven't felt like
this in a long time.

48:22.960 --> 48:24.724
I'm good at this.

48:24.920 --> 48:28.447
I need you, man.
I need you to...

48:29.480 --> 48:31.323
I need you to
believe in me, man.

48:33.360 --> 48:34.930
Please.

48:36.800 --> 48:38.325
I'm in.

48:42.040 --> 48:43.451
Were you about to cry?

48:43.520 --> 48:44.681
Yeah, I don't
wanna talk about it.

48:44.840 --> 48:46.520
I got misty, my heart
started pumping fast.

48:46.560 --> 48:47.880
So how are we
gonna find this guy?

48:50.120 --> 48:51.531
This is it.

48:51.680 --> 48:53.842
God, I'm getting good
at this detective stuff.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.843
Is that why you're
wearing that suit?

48:56.000 --> 48:57.525
Oh, yeah, I got promoted.

48:57.680 --> 49:00.251
You promoted
yourself again?

49:01.200 --> 49:02.611
Yeah. I'm a detective.

49:03.800 --> 49:05.720
What do you think
they're doing in there?

49:05.920 --> 49:08.161
I don't know, man. Something
shady, that's for sure.

49:08.320 --> 49:10.129
Let's see if we can get
inside and open those doors.

49:10.280 --> 49:11.440
Let's see if we
don't do that.

49:11.520 --> 49:12.601
Listen, Chang...

49:12.800 --> 49:15.121
you've gotta stop
being such a pussy, okay?

49:15.280 --> 49:16.441
Yeah, no shit.

49:16.640 --> 49:17.766
Dude...

49:17.840 --> 49:19.080
I will whoop
your little ass.

49:19.200 --> 49:20.880
You will not touch his ass.
I will hit him.

49:22.400 --> 49:23.970
Don't you
fucking hit me.

49:27.840 --> 49:28.921
Don't!

49:38.200 --> 49:39.440
Oh, perfect.

49:40.640 --> 49:43.120
If I wasn't involved in a case
right now, I would light you up.

49:48.640 --> 49:51.325
That right there, that apartment,
that's our vantage point.

49:52.640 --> 49:54.244
But somebody
lives in there.

49:54.880 --> 49:57.360
Justin, then they
better have good food...

49:57.520 --> 50:01.650
because they're about to be
involved in their first stakeout!

50:02.320 --> 50:03.367
No.

50:04.880 --> 50:06.848
Police business,
open up now.

50:09.960 --> 50:10.961
Hi.

50:11.600 --> 50:12.931
Hi.

50:13.360 --> 50:15.840
You are a fox,
aren't you?

50:16.800 --> 50:18.325
Detective?

50:18.480 --> 50:19.925
Absolutely,
that's my title.

50:20.120 --> 50:21.167
Dude.

50:21.640 --> 50:25.122
Uh, ma'am, we're gonna need to come inside
and talk to you for a minute, please.

50:25.280 --> 50:26.964
- Oh.
- All right.

50:28.640 --> 50:29.641
Oh, yeah.

50:29.800 --> 50:31.484
It smells like
a fish farted in here.

50:33.200 --> 50:36.090
Look at that bald one.
He looks super racist.

50:36.240 --> 50:38.208
Like he snores
the "N" word at night.

50:38.360 --> 50:39.520
I've seen every
cop show ever.

50:39.680 --> 50:42.001
I'm so excited we're going
to be doing this together.

50:42.160 --> 50:43.446
Yeah.

50:43.640 --> 50:45.563
Just so we're clear, there's
no "we" in this situation.

50:45.640 --> 50:46.721
Don't be a dick.

50:46.800 --> 50:48.165
I can still be a part of
the team though, right?

50:48.320 --> 50:49.481
Absolutely.
No.

50:49.640 --> 50:50.801
Also, I'm not
on ecstasy.

50:50.880 --> 50:52.041
No way.

50:52.120 --> 50:54.441
I've had some very
dramatic relationships.

50:54.720 --> 50:57.690
My therapist says I need
to meet a more stable guy.

50:58.320 --> 50:59.731
I love a man in uniform.

50:59.880 --> 51:01.530
You do?

51:01.680 --> 51:03.091
Sure.
I don't like this.

51:03.240 --> 51:04.920
I did a three-way once
with two paramedics.

51:07.160 --> 51:09.686
Ma'am, I'm going to need
you to go to your room.

51:09.960 --> 51:12.122
All right.
Alone.

51:12.280 --> 51:14.203
You do not know
what vibage is, pal.

51:14.480 --> 51:15.845
Why would you do that?

51:16.000 --> 51:18.287
I think she's an interesting lady and
she's got a lot to offer this team.

51:18.440 --> 51:20.761
We are doing surveillance.
We don't have time.

51:21.160 --> 51:22.161
Ow.

51:38.160 --> 51:40.208
All right,
we got action, people.

51:40.360 --> 51:42.328
Oh, good work, Joe.

51:46.640 --> 51:47.641
Who is that?

51:50.800 --> 51:52.484
I think he's the boss.

51:52.640 --> 51:53.801
Take photos
of his henchmen.

51:54.600 --> 51:56.011
You got good ones?

51:56.840 --> 51:58.171
How fun is this?

52:04.120 --> 52:06.202
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I need some help.

52:06.560 --> 52:08.210
It's my bubble bath.

52:08.520 --> 52:10.170
It's not wet enough.

52:12.480 --> 52:13.811
No.

52:13.880 --> 52:16.360
Yes. That's our
civic duty.

52:16.520 --> 52:18.727
- No, it's not.
- Focus.

52:18.880 --> 52:20.405
We would love to help you,
ma'am, but we can't...

52:20.560 --> 52:22.680
because we're on a case and
we take our job seriously.

52:22.920 --> 52:24.410
That is so hot.

52:24.560 --> 52:25.607
You're so hot.

52:29.640 --> 52:31.369
<i>Listen to me very carefully.</i>

52:31.520 --> 52:33.170
<i>I need you to lay low.</i>

52:33.320 --> 52:34.321
<i>Very low.</i>

52:36.480 --> 52:38.050
<i>For now.</i>

52:40.240 --> 52:42.083
The Dominicans are
going to make the delivery.

52:42.520 --> 52:44.887
And you're not going to do
shit with it until I say so.

52:45.520 --> 52:46.965
Understood?

52:47.120 --> 52:48.610
<i>You gonna keep
everything underground.</i>

52:48.760 --> 52:50.762
Underground?
What is he talking about?

52:51.280 --> 52:52.691
Deliver what?

52:52.840 --> 52:54.126
I don't know.

52:55.840 --> 52:57.171
What's this?

52:57.400 --> 52:59.080
This is the shipment.
This is our evidence.

52:59.320 --> 53:00.606
How do you know that?

53:00.760 --> 53:03.809
Because it's a cargo van,
and these are all bad guys.

53:04.800 --> 53:06.928
These guys are
terrible-looking people.

53:07.760 --> 53:09.250
Open it.

53:13.360 --> 53:15.203
Oh...
Shit.

53:18.200 --> 53:19.486
So?

53:19.560 --> 53:22.450
They tell me their badge
numbers don't match up.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.571
Which tells me one thing.
They're not LAPD.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.286
Oh, we're dead.

53:27.960 --> 53:29.121
So, what are they?

53:30.680 --> 53:33.001
Feds, ATF,
maybe a special unit.

53:33.840 --> 53:34.841
What?

53:35.200 --> 53:37.328
Yeah, we're
black ops, dude.

53:37.600 --> 53:40.251
So, you're going to be invisible
until I can figure it out.

53:41.160 --> 53:42.400
Just to be clear...

53:42.600 --> 53:44.045
if that little
guy wasn't here...

53:44.440 --> 53:47.046
some serious weird shit
would be going on right now.

53:48.040 --> 53:49.690
What kind of weird shit?

53:53.760 --> 53:57.082
You are an
acrobatic angel, aren't you?

53:57.160 --> 53:58.161
Ah.

53:58.240 --> 53:59.287
Joey, turn around.

53:59.880 --> 54:00.881
Oh!

54:00.960 --> 54:02.928
Okay.
There she goes.

54:06.800 --> 54:08.290
Boom, we got them.

54:08.440 --> 54:09.771
Now what's
in those crates?

54:09.920 --> 54:12.241
I'm seeing it the same time you're
seeing it. How would I know that?

54:12.400 --> 54:14.641
I need to narrate it, because that's
what you do in these situations.

54:14.800 --> 54:16.643
You see something and one of
the guys says it out loud.

54:16.800 --> 54:19.724
And the other guy, you, is
supposed to go, "Yeah."

54:20.760 --> 54:24.287
Oh, shit, dude. We gotta
know what's inside those crates.

54:26.600 --> 54:28.090
So, what do we do now?

54:32.200 --> 54:33.361
Joey, watch the fort.

54:33.520 --> 54:34.567
Where are you going?

54:34.720 --> 54:36.051
Wait a minute,
actually.

54:36.520 --> 54:37.520
Oh...

54:41.240 --> 54:43.163
That is so hot.

54:44.360 --> 54:45.441
There he is.

54:46.000 --> 54:47.570
This is a terrible idea.
Is it?

54:47.760 --> 54:48.761
Dude, are you kidding?

54:48.840 --> 54:49.841
No.

54:49.960 --> 54:51.121
He's a gang member.

54:51.200 --> 54:52.281
Exactly.

54:55.440 --> 54:56.601
Relax, I'm just
gonna go talk to him.

54:56.760 --> 54:58.444
I will not relax.
You're an idiot.

55:00.240 --> 55:01.924
I got this.

55:03.760 --> 55:04.921
Hello.

55:11.280 --> 55:13.521
You have the right to remain silent...

55:13.680 --> 55:14.761
Here we go.

55:15.120 --> 55:16.121
Justin, help me now!

55:16.440 --> 55:19.011
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

55:19.160 --> 55:20.969
You have the right
to an attorney.

55:22.080 --> 55:24.320
If you can't afford an attorney,
one will be appointed...

55:24.440 --> 55:26.204
He's biting my neck!
He's biting my neck!

55:26.360 --> 55:27.361
Ow!

55:30.280 --> 55:31.406
Can I talk
to you for a second?

55:31.480 --> 55:32.481
Sure.

55:35.320 --> 55:36.401
What the fuck!

55:36.600 --> 55:38.409
We've gotta find out
what's in those crates.

55:38.600 --> 55:39.760
Are you kidding me?
I'm not...

55:40.160 --> 55:41.161
No!

55:41.960 --> 55:42.961
Get in!

55:45.040 --> 55:46.405
Get in the car!

55:47.920 --> 55:49.001
Okay-

55:49.160 --> 55:50.605
So we're
kidnapping people now?

55:51.000 --> 55:53.162
No, Justin, it's called
an interrogation.

55:53.320 --> 55:54.800
Where are we going
to interrogate him?

56:01.000 --> 56:03.162
He's just a friend.
He's just a friend.

56:11.080 --> 56:13.800
We gotta get the information out
of him about what's in those crates.

56:13.920 --> 56:15.524
He doesn't even
speak English, dude.

56:15.720 --> 56:16.721
Then we torture him.

56:16.840 --> 56:19.161
You're the mysterious one.
You have to be bad cop.

56:19.320 --> 56:20.367
So now I'm torturing him?

56:20.560 --> 56:22.244
Hey, who said anything
about torture, Your Honor?

56:22.440 --> 56:24.408
You just did 3 seconds ago.
Shut up, dude.

56:24.560 --> 56:26.164
This is
a serious moment.

56:26.360 --> 56:28.089
Make him talk.

56:29.160 --> 56:30.366
You can do it.
All right.

56:30.520 --> 56:32.568
You can do it!
Yeah, born ready!

56:36.680 --> 56:38.200
Listen to me,
you little dick-snatch...

56:43.680 --> 56:44.681
What was that?

56:44.800 --> 56:46.484
He spit in my face.
He's not afraid of me.

56:46.640 --> 56:49.883
You know what, then
make him afraid of you.

56:50.040 --> 56:53.283
<i>Reservoir Dogs, dude.
Gut the ear.</i>

56:53.440 --> 56:55.044
Be realistic for once.

56:59.280 --> 57:00.884
Lift up that side.
I'm trying.

57:01.040 --> 57:04.123
What's in those crates?
What's in those crates?

57:04.280 --> 57:05.566
This is not how
you waterboard.

57:05.720 --> 57:07.961
<i>Yes it is! Have you
seen Zero Dark Thirty?</i>

57:08.120 --> 57:09.451
No, but I know
how to waterboard, though.

57:09.720 --> 57:10.801
Stop drinking it!

57:16.280 --> 57:17.805
What the hell, man?

57:17.960 --> 57:20.201
It's sad what you're trying to do.
It's embarrassing.

57:20.360 --> 57:22.089
All right.
I hate Mossi.

57:22.240 --> 57:24.766
Everybody does. I'll tell you
anything you want to know.

57:24.960 --> 57:26.041
Just stop this shit!

57:26.200 --> 57:27.531
Why didn't you
say that before?

57:27.680 --> 57:29.045
And that you
spoke English.

57:29.200 --> 57:32.170
You didn't ask. You guys
pulled me out of my truck.

57:32.320 --> 57:33.401
You drag me across
the fucking ground.

57:33.480 --> 57:34.527
That's on me.

57:34.720 --> 57:36.131
You throw me in
the back of a cop car.

57:36.200 --> 57:37.440
Point the guns in my face!

57:37.760 --> 57:39.888
Look, maybe we got off
on the wrong foot here.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.001
Yeah, maybe.

57:41.160 --> 57:42.207
You want a beer?

57:42.360 --> 57:44.124
Yeah, beer sounds good.

57:44.280 --> 57:45.327
What's your name?

57:45.520 --> 57:46.646
My name is Pupa.

57:47.480 --> 57:48.925
If we untie you,
do you promise

57:49.000 --> 57:50.331
not to freak out
and kill us?

57:51.880 --> 57:53.405
I promise not
to freak out.

57:55.520 --> 57:57.170
Ah, man!

57:57.320 --> 58:00.005
For real, I don't know
what's in those crates.

58:00.200 --> 58:03.124
But Mossi paid some heavy
cash for whatever's in there.

58:03.280 --> 58:04.770
But how do we find out?

58:04.960 --> 58:07.566
Mossi's having one of his parties tonight.
I hear shit gets crazy.

58:07.720 --> 58:10.769
At least 3 people die,
everytime he has a party.

58:10.960 --> 58:12.849
What?
Those crates will be there...

58:13.000 --> 58:14.889
but if you wait until tomorrow
that shit's going to be gone.

58:15.040 --> 58:17.042
So we gotta do it tonight.
You gotta do it tonight.

58:19.280 --> 58:21.328
Shit, this game
is gangster!

58:21.480 --> 58:22.970
Really? Gangster?

58:23.120 --> 58:25.646
It is, man, I tell you.
Where can I buy this thing?

58:25.800 --> 58:27.882
You see, Pupa,
it's kind of complicated.

58:28.040 --> 58:30.247
There's a lot that goes into
making games these days.

58:30.440 --> 58:31.441
Oh, Justin.

58:31.560 --> 58:34.131
A lot of politics. I'm
talking to a lot of people.

58:34.320 --> 58:36.607
It sounds like you bitched
out, is what it sounds like.

58:36.760 --> 58:38.888
You gotta go in there
and fight for your shit.

58:39.040 --> 58:40.326
Don't you believe
in yourself?

58:40.480 --> 58:41.561
You gotta go in
there and tell them...

58:41.720 --> 58:44.485
"This is my game. We're
going to do it my way.

58:44.640 --> 58:47.041
"Put the game out there now,
for people to buy it."

58:47.200 --> 58:48.964
I gotta say, we have to
get into that party.

58:49.120 --> 58:50.963
We gotta get in
that party tonight.

58:51.120 --> 58:52.600
I don't understand
what you're saying.

58:52.640 --> 58:55.325
When you start getting excited,
your English escapes you...

58:55.480 --> 58:57.448
and you get really
native in your tongue.

58:57.600 --> 58:59.250
How do we get
into that party?

58:59.400 --> 59:01.480
When I'm speaking English but it still
sounds like...

59:01.520 --> 59:02.885
Like that, I don't
what you're saying.

59:03.000 --> 59:04.280
You didn't get
any of that?

59:04.960 --> 59:05.961
<i>Qué?</i>

59:06.040 --> 59:07.166
You didn't get any...

59:07.280 --> 59:08.645
Qué?
Holy shit.

59:09.120 --> 59:10.121
What?
What?

59:10.240 --> 59:12.083
This is gonna sound
a little bit weird...

59:13.080 --> 59:15.208
But you two could
pass as brothers.

59:15.400 --> 59:16.970
Ew! No,
this guy's gross!

59:17.080 --> 59:18.081
No offense.

59:18.280 --> 59:20.851
No offense?
You just said, "Ew."

59:21.000 --> 59:25.164
The last person who said,
"Ew" to me, was my mother.

59:25.320 --> 59:26.367
Hmm.

59:26.440 --> 59:28.602
You guys know
where she is right now?

59:28.760 --> 59:30.728
Heaven?
You got it.

59:30.840 --> 59:32.001
Heaven.

59:32.960 --> 59:34.246
Hopefully from
natural causes?

59:35.240 --> 59:39.689
If me getting angry and doing something
foolish is natural causes...

59:39.840 --> 59:41.001
then yes.

59:42.440 --> 59:43.560
You look handsome.
Thank you.

59:43.640 --> 59:46.041
A great-looking guy.
Now I'm here to play war.

59:46.200 --> 59:48.601
Hey, Chang.
How do I make you...

59:49.480 --> 59:50.527
look like him?

59:53.400 --> 59:54.401
Shit.

59:55.680 --> 59:56.681
How much time we got?

59:57.080 --> 59:58.127
Uh...
Shut up.

59:58.320 --> 01:00:01.927
I need a water, three bowls and a lemon
peel. Come on, people, let's go!

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.127
That's my girl.

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:05.726
She said she'd done a three-way
with a couple of paramedics.

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.081
Mmm-hmm I think this
the marrying type.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.321
Sounds like it to me.

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.642
All right.
Are you ready?

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.165
We're ready.

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.450
Oh, ho-ho.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.443
That's handsome.
Well...

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:22.922
I look like someone hit me
in the face with Lil Wayne.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:25.721
Lil Wayne!

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.650
He made a joke
about Lil Wayne!

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:32.331
Oh, shit! That's funny.

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.682
Hey, Josie, I gotta say
you're one heck of an artist.

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.602
- Thank you.
- You're fine, too, girl.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:38.921
Yeah, she's pretty.

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.003
Josie, Josie,
look at me. Look at me.

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:43.162
Don't do intense right now.
Okay.

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.004
You're crazy fine,
that's all I'm saying.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.361
That's a compliment,
now let it go.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:47.720
Just gonna
say one more thing.

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:49.450
I wouldn't, though,
is what I'm saying.

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.204
I promise it's
going to be okay.

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:53.840
I mean, I would like
to take off your dress...

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:55.240
and put my
penis inside of you.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.487
I'd really like to
get all up in that shit.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.449
No, like in her
vagina, though.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.250
I know, but you can't say that.
Appreciate it.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.600
I wouldn't put
it in your butt.

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.800
I gotta go. And
a good day to you, madame.

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:08.720
Do you think I could put "Undercover sting
operation for the LAPD" on my resume?

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:09.881
Absolutely.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.603
Did you see when I said
"madame?" That's French.

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:13.761
That was sweet.

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.446
Here you go, buddy.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.011
What if I start
sweating, dude?

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:18.605
These tattoos are
gonna run down my face.

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:19.681
Then don't sweat.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.444
What do you mean, "Don't
sweat?" I'm not doing this.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.125
Why you got to
be such a bitch?

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.249
Pupa, don't
call me a bitch.

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:29.200
You made such a cool game. If you
make it, then you got to play it.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:30.646
I've been saying
that this whole time.

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:33.889
You made such a cool game,
now you gotta play it.

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:35.605
What are you doing
with your accent?

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:37.250
What are you
doing with your voice?

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:38.526
I was agreeing
with you.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:39.726
But you have an accent.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.809
I know you are agreeing with me,
but you're saying it like I was.

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:45.885
What I'm saying is, you made a
great game and I believe in you.

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.361
So, now, you just gotta
play it.

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:49.851
All right, dude.
Feel free to rob him.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.083
Oh, boy. He can't hear you. I'm just
going to ignore him from now on.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.287
How is this on me?

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:56.249
This is insane.

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:58.920
Listen, Justin,
no matter what happens...

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.525
no matter what
anyone says to you,

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.085
all you gotta
say to them is...

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:07.526
What does that mean?

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:11.241
It means, "Suck my balls
and cock, you cocksucker."

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.243
Yeah, just say that.
Okay.

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.762
Good luck, homes. You're gonna need it.

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:19.207
Look, I'm telling you,
we look a lot alike.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:21.328
But Mossi is probably gonna
recognize that you're not me...

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:22.965
and then he gonna
cut your face off!

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:24.770
All right. Is that...?

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:26.160
What are you talking about?

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:29.244
Whoo! I'm sorry.
It's not funny.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.050
Wait a second.
What?

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.406
One extra
touch for you.

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:33.641
Pretty good,
right here.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.604
Oh God, no.

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:37.921
Just trust him.
Put it in.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.362
You put this in your mouth.
Ow. Ryan!

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.567
You'll need it.
You need it, man.

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.285
Here they come.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:45.362
Ow. Ow. Aah!

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.010
I'm going to die here.

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:05.970
It smells like prison
and bad parenting.

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:08.042
Oh! Oh!

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:10.409
<i>Relax! You'll be in and out.</i>

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:13.803
All we gotta do is find out what's
in those crates and you'll be done.

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.689
We'll get footage of it,
and you're out.

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:18.810
That's easy for you to say.
They are all staring at me.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:22.203
Then stare back at them.
You are a cholo vato killer!

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.050
<i>Own that shit!</i>

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.248
I suck balls and cock.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:37.564
Ah.

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:40.046
<i>Coño.</i>

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.921
That's what I thought. Ah,
dude, I think it's working!

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.003
Hell yeah, Chang!
You tell them!

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.400
<i>Nice! Okay, we're in!</i>

01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:58.966
<i>Dude, those chicks are hot.</i>

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.929
Shut up, dude.
I'm freaking out.

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:04.562
<i>Just relax. Be like everybody
else or you'll stand out.</i>

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:07.641
Good.

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:12.891
<i>Dude! What are you doing?</i>

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.371
I'm doing my
white girl dance.

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:15.806
<i>Stop doing that shit!</i>

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:19.329
There's got to be some sort
of back room or storage area.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.729
You've got some
balls coming in here.

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.446
Come with me.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.045
Mossi's gonna
wanna speak to you.

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:29.528
Been looking for you.
Okay.

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:32.450
Shit, what do I do?

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.443
<i>I don't know,
but don't be nervous.</i>

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:37.120
<i>But don't
fuck it up, either.</i>

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.365
The fuck are you
doing here?

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:43.323
I best not be finding out
you lost one of my crates.

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:45.761
<i>Make him say
what's in those crates!</i>

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:48.441
Um...

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:52.806
What exactly are we referring
to in those crates, bro?

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.207
Hit this shit.

01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:01.524
Nah, bro. I'm already
super piped-out.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:04.331
I was like, this pipe,
that pipe, every pipe.

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:07.006
You know what I'm saying?
You feel me? Coño.

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:09.049
I didn't ask.

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:11.368
<i>Just do it, dude.
He's testing you.</i>

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.570
You just got
cranked up, fool.

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:38.203
Ryan, what did I just smoke?
What does "cranked up" mean?

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:40.249
You just smoked
crystal meth, dude.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.443
<i>Crystal meth?
It's not going to affect you.</i>

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:44.800
It's not going to affect me?
What are you talking about?

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:48.444
<i>Right there! They have a basement!
You gotta go down there.</i>

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:51.331
No way, dude. Frigging
twitching right now.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.527
<i>Do not puss out now!</i>

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:53.647
I'm pussing out.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:54.841
Listen to me.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.843
You gotta go down there
and see what that was.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.240
You listen to me,
all right?

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:00.288
I'm having a heart
attack right here!

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:02.886
<i>All right,
just open up that window.</i>

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.963
Okay. Okay.

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.485
Why'd you hit me in the face for?
It's me!

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.000
Move! I've got an
awesome entrance.

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.930
Fuck, yeah!

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:15.081
That wasn't cool.

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:18.920
What the fuck are you wearing?
Here's where we're at.

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:21.520
I did some intel, and that's
their safehouse down there.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.164
As the leader
in our situation,

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:24.844
I'm gonna check
that out first.

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:27.407
You're gonna hang out in the
hallway and stand guard, okay?

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.688
What? No, dude,
I'm on crystal meth!

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.928
I know, it's awesome.
I'm very jealous of that.

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:34.481
How fun is it? I've done it 11 times.
Eleven?

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:36.291
And I smoked crack once.

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:37.726
Let's go!
No, please.

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:40.281
Don't leave me alone here.
Please, I'm itching.

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.080
I've got this post-nasal
drip thing going.

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.890
Don't do that!
You're gonna make me...

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:47.526
Don't... Hey!
Think about something else.

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:49.170
Think about apple pie.

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:50.921
I've got to take
my teeth out.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.001
I gotta take the hat off.

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:54.360
I gotta take this thing off my ear.
Wig off.

01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:02.766
Okay, come on.

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:08.927
What the hell
are you doing?

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:14.486
Oh, shit.
I can't stop twitching.

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.330
Okay, just don't think about it.
It's a mind thing.

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.481
Okay-

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:24.405
Come on, J.

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:27.690
I'm so scared.
Hold my hand.

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:29.445
I'm not holding
your hand.

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:32.122
Dude, I think I'm
addicted to crystal meth.

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:33.281
You just
smoked it once.

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:36.490
Oh, my God. I would suck
dick for this high.

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:37.641
You've got
to be kidding.

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:39.211
I wouldn't,
but what if I do?

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.691
I don't want
to suck dick.

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:42.880
Because I know I'm
gonna get good at it.

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:48.289
Oh!

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:49.641
Shit!

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.481
Look at all
these lights!

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:53.768
Not the lights. We're excited
about the guns, right?

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.008
Right. Right.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:58.003
Holy shit.
Justin, it's the crates.

01:07:58.160 --> 01:07:59.321
Check it out.
Jackpot, dude.

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:01.209
Jack-motherfucking-pot.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.445
See these tags?
Yeah, man.

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:04.641
You know what these are?

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:06.728
These were confiscated
by the police.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:07.927
Yeah.

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:11.209
They were supposed to destroy this shit.
He stole all this.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:12.930
I feel real good
right now.

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:15.162
I want to build a porch.
We should build a porch!

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:16.885
Right now! That'd be great.
Right.

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:19.281
I don't even know if I'm good
at woodwork or anything...

01:08:19.439 --> 01:08:22.091
but I feel like
I can do that.

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:24.362
Mmm.
Dude, look at me.

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:25.805
Hey! Hey!

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:27.041
Hey, hey.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.247
You wanna
go crazy, dude?

01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:29.321
No.

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:30.645
Neither do I.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.529
Thank you. That makes
me feel like a leader.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:34.091
Holy shit.
You know what this is?

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:35.680
Clothes.

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:37.524
This is actual
SWAT gear, man.

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:40.809
Let's be real. We're never
gonna build a porch.

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:42.450
We're just lying
to ourselves, man.

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:44.523
I just want
to die, dude.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.371
What the hell is going
on with you, man?

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:50.769
Something's going on inside my heart.
It hurts.

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.729
Let's go, meth head, now.
I'm sorry.

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.281
Now!
I'm sorry, man.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:56.725
I feel so sad!

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:57.926
Stop.

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:04.881
Whoa.

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:07.886
Look at how far
this one goes.

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:12.524
What are you doing?

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:15.569
This is so white trash, I don't
even know what I'm saying.

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:20.290
What is that sound?

01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:24.682
Our heroes rise from
the depths of Hades!

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.161
Stop, dude. You're
getting so scary.

01:09:27.479 --> 01:09:30.086
Hey, man, where
are you going? Wait up.

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:33.850
I got it. Mossi looks like
the original General Zod.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.126
Hey!
Aah!

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:36.651
Hey-

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:38.370
You and me, right now.

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:40.328
Wait!
I'll rip your head off!

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:48.807
Timeout, okay?

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:52.366
Seriously, guys!

01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:38.121
Uh-huh.

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:42.287
Who's next?

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:48.965
Fuck.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.360
Check it out.
It's a jackpot.

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:51.487
What?

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:53.329
Look, with the guns...

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:56.769
with the SWAT, and Mossi's boss,
I got all his guys pinned.

01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:00.083
I've got enough evidence to
put this guy away for years.

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:02.242
That's great, man.
Remember that long tunnel?

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:03.441
See where it leads?

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.125
It leads to Georgie's.

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:06.441
Oh.

01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:08.761
That's why he
wants Georgie's so bad.

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:11.048
It's not about money laundering.
It's about having control...

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:12.810
of both ends
of the tunnel.

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:14.564
Do you see?
Why?

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:16.085
That's the right question.

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:20.165
Do you remember Segars said that
every time that they raid Mossi...

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.890
they come up
with nothing.

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:25.887
He's using the tunnel as an escape
route to get rid of all the stuff.

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.805
I cracked the case, man.

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:31.682
I'm getting so good
at this that it's scary.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.080
Where are you
going with that?

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:35.610
To the police station,
to turn it in.

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.967
No, you're not.
We're mailing it in...

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.849
anonymously like we said.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.684
Justin, come on.
This is my collar.

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.285
No one can know
this was us.

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:44.606
What is wrong with you?

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.091
I worked hard on this.

01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:47.600
Why are you
getting so pissed off?

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:49.125
Because I almost
died in there!

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:50.765
All right.
Look at my face!

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.771
I smoked crystal meth!

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.564
That's not funny!
All right.

01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:57.960
And for what? So you could
have some self-worth for once?

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.128
Where is this
coming from, man?

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:02.807
I didn't do this for my
self-worth or whatever!

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.731
I did it to get a guy like
Mossi off the streets...

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:07.007
and we're going to!

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:08.844
Unlike you,
who runs away...

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.048
anytime anything
in your life gets tough!

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:13.323
And maybe that's why
you're still nowhere.

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:15.962
Oh, I'm still nowhere? Me?

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:17.121
Yeah, you.

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:19.282
You've been moping
around for 8 years!

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:22.723
Complaining about, "Oh, life screwed me.
That's why I didn't go pro."

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:24.610
Life did screw me.
That's why I didn't go pro.

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:27.366
You jumped off
a roof at a pool party.

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:28.931
That's how you
injured yourself.

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:30.286
Be careful of where
you're going right now.

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:32.568
Life didn't screw you.
You screwed yourself.

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:34.490
Take some
responsibility for once.

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:36.290
Why don't you act
like a man for once,

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:37.920
because you might
like the way it feels.

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:43.771
You know what?
Everyone was right about you.

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:45.281
About what?

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.683
You're a loser.

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:01.285
Be a man.

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:05.848
All right, okay.
I'll show you what a man does.

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:08.882
I'll show you what a man does!

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.281
You got Mossi?

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:12.441
I got him.

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.081
Wow.

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:16.850
In this envelope, l got
enough hard evidence...

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.809
to put away Mossi Kasic
for a lot of years.

01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:20.650
Holy cow!

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:23.167
You and Chang make
a great team, you know?

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:24.321
Yeah.

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:28.040
I gotta get this in the right
hands right away. Can you help?

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:29.650
Detective Brolin.
You've heard of him.

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:32.571
He's in charge of the Organized Crime
Division. He's gonna love this.

01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:34.200
Might as well go
straight to the top.

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:35.645
Straight to the top.

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:42.966
Let's do this.

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.441
Mmm.
What's up, baby girl?

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:49.169
Carl, park in my spot one more time
and I'm gonna punch you in the dick.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:51.482
Larry! Fuck you!

01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:58.682
Okay. Okay.

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:01.125
Okay!

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.521
All right!

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:04.683
There he is.

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.730
Detective Brolin.

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.289
I would like you to meet
Sergeant O'Malley.

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.210
O'Malley, this is
Detective Brolin.

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:15.921
Pleasure.

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:18.441
Yeah.

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:21.361
Have a seat.

01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:25.091
Sergeant O'Malley says he's
got some hard evidence...

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:26.241
on Mossi Kasic.

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:28.682
Enough to take him
and his whole crew down.

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:33.604
There's some things
in here I didn't put...

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.800
It's okay.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.401
It's okay. I wanna take
a look at it anyway.

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:42.120
Sergeant O'Malley has been
doing some surveillance...

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:44.726
of Mossi and his crew
for quite awhile now.

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.050
I think he's got some
good stuff in there, sir.

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:48.964
He seems pretty
excited about it.

01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:55.205
Give us a minute alone.

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:56.407
Yes, sir.

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:57.846
Not you.

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:00.845
Relax.

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:08.486
Who are you?

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:11.689
I asked a question.
Who are you?

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:15.003
Before you do anything, I
already made copies of that.

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:16.889
Do you have a family?

01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:19.651
Are your parents
still alive?

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:22.610
Yeah, my parents
are alive... No.

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:37.483
I am running a routine
undercover investigation...

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:39.688
to bring down Mossi Kasic...

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:41.690
and you're interfering.

01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:44.046
That's not true.

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:45.481
Oh, it's not true?
No.

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:46.681
Well, whoever you are...

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:49.967
I suggest you run,
very far away...

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.168
and grow eyes in
the back of your head...

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:54.442
because you're never gonna
know when it's coming.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.729
Do you know who I am?

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:06.720
I'm the guy who's gonna...

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.564
Take me down.

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:11.090
You've been
watching too many movies.

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:12.481
Yeah.

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.969
But I'm still
gonna take you down.

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:17.448
So I guess we'll see.

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:20.441
I guess we'll see.

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:31.280
Hey, O'Malley,
where are you going?

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:33.602
I forgot something
in my car, Segars.

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:44.001
Wow.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.680
This sucks shit.
This isn't cool.

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.805
When I came up
with it, it was cool.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.365
Where are
their superpowers?

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:53.167
We can give the
firefighters superpowers.

01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:54.367
It's just...

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:56.240
It's just what?

01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:59.091
It's just your
idea sucks shit, Todd.

01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:03.364
What was that? I said
your idea sucks shit.

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:07.443
Justin, where are you? Call
me as soon as you get this.

01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:10.120
You know that mobster, the guy
we thought was Mossi's boss?

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:11.281
He's a cop.

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:13.243
And he's got all
of our evidence...

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:15.044
which means Mossi
knows everything.

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:16.281
Holy shit, dude!

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:18.244
We're dead! Dead! Dead!

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.401
Okay, no.

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:20.891
Everything is
gonna be fine.

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:22.724
Nothing can trace back to us.

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:25.323
His name is
Ryan O'Malley,

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:28.006
and he currently
lives with this guy...

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:29.565
Justin Miller.

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:31.800
Okay, print everything out
and bring it to my office.

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.368
Hold on a second.

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:36.805
I found the problem.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.411
They're not even real cops.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:40.961
What do you mean
they're not real cops?

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:42.326
<i>Just what I said!</i>

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:43.960
We gotta take care
of this right away.

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:49.927
Get it done!

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:53.290
I want the word on the street, underground!
Anyone who gets them!

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:02.442
You're not even supposed to be
in here, let alone talking.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:04.921
A bunch of
shirtless firefighters...

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:07.646
spraying zombies
with their hoses?

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:09.920
What kind of game you
trying to make, bro?

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:12.521
I'm gonna give you one second
to get the fuck out of here.

01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:16.527
You like that?

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:17.726
This guy is crazy.

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:19.524
Yeah, ese.

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:23.408
Now, a few weeks ago...

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:26.882
I pitched you a game
and you didn't listen.

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:28.883
That really
hurt my feelings.

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.282
You were there.
So were you.

01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:34.042
Now, I'm going to
pitch my game again

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:36.168
and you're going
to hear me out...

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:40.086
or I'm going to beat the shit
out of everyone in this room.

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:43.090
And I've fought
women before.

01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:44.811
I didn't Win...

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:47.247
but I'm down
to redeem myself.

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:51.363
<i>What if we made
a game so visceral...</i>

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:54.126
<i>that it made you feel like you
were in real life danger?</i>

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:57.284
To feel like it's
about to go down?

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:02.407
<i>Don't think of it as a game.</i>

01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:05.245
<i>Think of it as
a real life experience.</i>

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:10.647
<i>You are a cop.</i>

01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:16.282
<i>My game is about
getting into situations</i>

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:18.328
<i>you wouldn't be in
in your normal life.</i>

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:21.566
Situations that
are dangerous.

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:22.960
Real.

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.441
Where it felt like you
could actually get killed.

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.241
Aah!

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:14.411
Real violence isn't
like in the movies.

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.165
There he is!

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:23.050
Gunfire is terrifying.

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:26.204
<i>Bullets are sick.</i>

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:28.488
They blast and rip
through everything.

01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:34.848
But isn't that what
people want, right?

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:37.840
To really feel what it's
like to be in the shit?

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:49.527
That's what I'm
talking about, people.

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:50.841
Excuse me.

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:54.527
Justin, there is a police officer
in the lobby to see you.

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:57.843
No, no. You can tell
Ryan to wait, please.

01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:03.762
Justin! Do not go home!
I'm coming to your work!

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.325
We are in
a lot of trouble...

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:07.530
No, no, no.

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:09.166
No, no, no!

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:13.404
I can assure you that I will
make this thing more real...

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:15.449
than anything you have
ever seen in your life.

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:19.361
How are you gonna show us
this realistic violence, huh?

01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:21.771
Freeze!

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:23.331
Nobody move!

01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:27.521
You!

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:52.246
That's a presentation!

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:53.720
Let's make this game!

01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:56.006
Aah!

01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:58.362
What the fuck have
you guys been doing, huh?

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:02.880
Dude, where
the hell are you?

01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:04.367
<i>Are you having fun?</i>

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:07.731
<i>Justin Miller.</i>

01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:11.043
<i>You wanna be a cop? Average
police response time...</i>

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:12.201
<i>12 minutes.</i>

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:15.921
<i>Average time it takes for a
man to bleed out, 7 minutes.</i>

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.243
You do the math.
Ryan.

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:19.361
Ryan!

01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:21.647
<i>Don't come, Justin!
Run! Run!</i>

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:24.080
Ryan!

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:27.321
Fuck!

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:30.520
Officer Segars.

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:32.483
Segars, it's Justin.
Who?

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:34.210
It's Chang. I'm Chang.

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.601
Chang? What the hell,
you piece of shit!

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.920
I'm hearing all kinds of crazy things!
I know, I know.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.764
And what you heard is true.
We're not cops.

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:44.049
<i>It's</i> true? <i>But everything I'm about
to tell you right now is real.</i>

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:45.960
Mossi has got Ryan,
and he is gonna kill him.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.810
He's got him in an underground
tunnel beneath Tirana, Mossi's club.

01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:50.800
What underground tunnels
are you talking about?

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:51.840
<i>It's their safehouse.</i>

01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:53.920
And there are cops involved.
They tried to shoot me.

01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:57.011
Hey, you better watch
what you're saying, Chang.

01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:59.521
Just come to Tirana, and
you'll see it for yourself.

01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:00.886
<i>Please!</i>

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:05.724
Where are you right now?

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:18.491
How are you
doing, partner?

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:20.521
Long time no see.

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:23.241
Mmm.

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:25.249
You have the vest on.

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.731
That's not gonna help.

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:30.248
You're gonna die today.
And so is your friend.

01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:33.485
So the best thing you can do
is just tell me everything.

01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:36.009
Who did you give
the evidence to?

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:39.121
How many copies
do you have?

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:42.163
Your choice.

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:44.609
You go quick
and painless...

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:47.240
or you're gonna endure
something that is...

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:49.961
unspeakable.

01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:06.727
Hey-

01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:08.331
What are you doing
down there?

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:10.610
Josie, you gotta
go, okay?

01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:13.081
Take Georgie and Lydia and
get out of here right now.

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:15.769
What are you talking about?
Don't come...

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:18.130
I'm not a cop, okay?

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:19.401
Why do you keep
Saying that?

01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:20.527
It's complicated.

01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:23.040
But what's most important
is that you leave right now.

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:25.080
Then, if you're not a cop,
who the hell are you?

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.522
No one you want to know.

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:29.651
Now go.

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:38.244
Sorry to bother you gentlemen.
I need to come in...

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:39.890
and take a look around.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.764
Just don't hurt him.
This was my idea.

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:10.160
Just let him be.

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:11.367
I'm the only one...

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:12.851
Hey-

01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:18.364
One of your
pigs is upstairs.

01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:20.602
I thought you had
control of your cops.

01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:26.681
Uh...

01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:34.810
No, no, no, Mossi, listen.

01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:36.200
Mossi, listen to me.

01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:37.686
You think he's
gonna protect you?

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:41.128
You think a guy like that is gonna
protect you? Think about this.

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:44.524
I've got evidence
to put him away for years.

01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:46.967
You don't think he's gonna
cover his tracks with you?

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:49.088
Huh? Think, Mossi!

01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:50.810
What is your backup plan?

01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:56.960
No, no.

01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:02.207
No. No, please.

01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:04.091
No, no, no, please.

01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:07.249
No, no, no!

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:11.886
No!

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:14.129
Shit!

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:17.931
That's my backup plan.

01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:26.805
Ryan! Ryan!

01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:50.920
Where do these doors go?

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:55.761
This is gonna be so much
easier if you just hold still.

01:26:57.360 --> 01:26:59.567
Hold still!

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:04.486
Open. Open. Open.

01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:05.721
No!

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:08.450
I'll shoot him!
I'll shoot him!

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.161
I swear to God...

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:13.321
Oh...

01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:15.771
I had your 6, dude.

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:20.200
Drop your weapons!
Get down!

01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:29.883
What are you doing?
Saving your life!

01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:32.240
But don't get on top of me like this!
I don't like this!

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.571
6-Adam-7. Shots fired.
Request all available units...

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:39.722
Justin, get off!
What the hell was that?

01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:42.247
Help get these
off me, quick.

01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:43.930
Holy shit.

01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:46.531
You all right?
Yeah, are you okay?

01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:47.681
Yeah.

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:49.723
Thank you for
saving us... Just shut up!

01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:50.961
We didn't mean
to screw you over.

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:52.491
It was never our intention
to pull you into this.

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:53.687
I don't care.

01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:56.361
Get upstairs
and get outside!

01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:58.807
And take that thing off.
That's a uniform.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.765
You gotta earn it. You
understand that, "Sarge?"

01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:04.123
Now get the fuck
out of here.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.764
6-Adam-7.
I need backup, now.

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:17.729
What are you doing?

01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:21.044
I can't do this.

01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:23.682
He's outmanned, he's
outgunned, and it's my fault.

01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:26.411
You were right. I gotta take
responsibility for once.

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:27.561
That's not
what I meant.

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:28.801
Wait!

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.121
What, man?

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:35.250
No more
running away, right?

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:55.089
Yeah.

01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:58.046
What the fuck?

01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:00.680
My bad.
Let's not use these.

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:31.488
What are you doing?
Get the hell out of here!

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:36.086
Go! Now!

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.889
Here's what we gotta do. We gotta
pull the fire away from him.

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.451
He's stuck, okay?
All right.

01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:48.762
On the count of three, we
gotta shoot like crazy, okay?

01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:49.921
Okay?
Okay.

01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:52.481
3,2,1.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.402
Segars!
They killed Segars, man!

01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:16.288
All right, we gotta find a door.
Look back here. Let's go.

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:18.329
We gotta get
the fuck out of here.

01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:19.811
Shit, man.

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:22.363
What are we gonna do?

01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:01.010
Being in the shit
isn't the shit.

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:02.321
No, it's not the shit.

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:17.486
Look, man,
I'm sorry about everything.

01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:19.802
Everything I said.
I didn't mean...

01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:23.282
Justin, we're brothers.

01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:26.446
Yeah. Yeah.

01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:29.361
Yeah, we're brothers...

01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:35.169
Get up, get up!

01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:37.371
Are you okay?

01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:40.364
Did I just get shot? No, it's just
the spray. You're okay. We gotta go.

01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:41.441
I just got shot!

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:43.200
Like I haven't been shot before.
Come on!

01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:44.241
What?
Let's go.

01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:51.327
Before we die,
I just want to tell you...

01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:53.966
If you tell me you love me, I'm
gonna punch you in your face.

01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:55.121
But we're about to die!

01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:56.645
But you were about to say
that you loved me!

01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:59.087
Yeah.
Say something better.

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:00.921
Fuck you.

01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:02.690
That's better.

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:10.565
Ryan?

01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:14.326
Ryan? Ryan?

01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:38.527
Shit.

01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:46.564
Chang!

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:47.801
Oh!

01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:49.490
Fuck, Chang!

01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:16.561
Are you okay?

01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:18.370
Beside the fact that you
shot me, I'm great, Chang.

01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:19.521
I'm sorry.

01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:22.887
Segars, those two
with you?

01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:32.009
Yeah, we're good.

01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:34.406
Code 4.

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:36.164
All teams, 10-12.

01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:54.124
<i>Really too late to call so</i>

01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:56.568
<i>We waited for</i>

01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:05.210
<i>Morning to wake you
That's all we got</i>

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:15.727
<i>To know me as hardly golden</i>

01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:22.447
<i>ls to know me all wrong</i>

01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:24.650
<i>They were</i>

01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:31.209
<i>At every occasion I'll be</i>

01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:34.329
<i>Ready for a funeral</i>

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:41.250
<i>At every occasion...</i>

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:42.805
<i>Life can
get confusing...</i>

01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:46.525
<i>and you lose sight of the
person you wanted to be.</i>

01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:55.044
<i>The Los Angeles Police
Department is proud to announce...</i>

01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:58.283
<i>Mossi Kasic is no longer
a threat to this city.</i>

01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:01.125
<i>Fortunately, I did not have
to make this arrest alone.</i>

01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:04.966
<i>This was truly a team effort.</i>

01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:07.886
<i>All right, man.</i>

01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:10.486
I'm passing this
gauntlet on to you...

01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:13.120
so don't let these streets get
all messed up again, all right?

01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:15.128
I got this shit, bro.

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:19.208
<i>Sometimes, you have
to go through hell and back.</i>

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:20.731
Or, we just
blow shit up!

01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:23.724
<i>To see that the problems you
thought were so big in your life...</i>

01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:25.651
<i>weren't so big after all.</i>

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:28.565
Or not. We could just do
what you want to do.

01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:29.721
Right.

01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:32.320
The 2 cops have to work together to
get out. I think it could be great.

01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:33.925
Are you writing
this down?

01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:35.485
Give me that.
Write that down.

01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:37.400
<i>And that courage
you always wanted...</i>

01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:40.445
<i>you always had it. You just
needed to get in the game.</i>

01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:42.401
Hi.

01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:43.970
Sorry, we don't
serve liars here.

01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:45.880
Can I get you a cup of
bullshit for the road?

01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:51.170
Josie, I didn't come
here to win you back.

01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:54.725
Or go back to whatever
we were before.

01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:59.327
I just came here to tell
you that I am truly sorry.

01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:03.605
And this is what I should
have done from the get-go.

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:07.088
Hi, I'm Justin.
Justin Miller.

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:11.684
I'm a 30-year-old video game
designer and I have a roommate.

01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:15.005
Nice to meet you.

01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:23.001
I'm sorry.

01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:26.164
I'm Josie. It's nice
to meet you, too.

01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:36.724
Officer Nicholas Thomas.

01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:40.690
<i>Officer Ryan O'Malley.</i>

01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:55.322
<i>And with hard work...</i>

01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:57.847
<i>and a little help
from a friend...</i>

01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:00.447
you can become that guy you
have always wanted to be.

01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:05.289
Thank you.

01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:07.085
Yeah!

01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:35.000
Aren't you a little
out of your jurisdiction?

01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:37.970
I'm off-duty, civilian.
And get in.

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:45.607
Easy, dude!

01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:50.086
What's Pupa doing here?

01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:53.005
He's my informant. Now that
I need ears on the street.

01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:55.447
I'm the ears and the eyes
on the street for him to know.

01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:57.360
<i>All units be advised.</i>

01:37:57.400 --> 01:37:59.641
<i>Possible 2-11 Sierra
in progress.</i>

01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:01.006
Awesome, a 2-11 Sierra.

01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:02.844
Okay, drop me off right here.

01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:05.766
Oh, why are you
being such a bitch?

01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:07.524
Pupa, stop calling me a bitch!

01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:09.170
Dispatch, we are in route.

01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:10.887
No, we are not in route.

01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:11.961
Yes, we are.

01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:13.120
No, we are not.
Yes, we are.

01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:14.321
Don't touch that!

01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:17.609
We're gonna arrest you!

01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:21.048
That is a Code 3, Chang!
We are back!

01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:22.121
Whoo!

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:33.721
Pizza <i>boy, freeze!</i>

01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:35.928
<i>Put the pizzas down, now.</i>

01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:37.247
<i>Put the pizzas down!</i>

01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:39.050
<i>Put them down!</i>

01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:40.281
<i>And the sodas!
And the sodas, too!</i>

01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:41.481
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:57.209
You need to test
drive it for what?

01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:58.601
For emissions, sir.

01:38:58.760 --> 01:38:59.921
Now step outside.

01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:01.724
Hey, Chang, hop in.
This one's you, bud.

01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:03.086
Yeah!
Yeah!

01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:05.245
I love that car!
