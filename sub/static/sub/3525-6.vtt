00:09.300 --> 00:12.200
# You woke up
this morning #

00:12.300 --> 00:14.700
# Got yourself a gun #

00:14.800 --> 00:18.550
# Your momma always said
you'd be the Chosen One #

00:18.585 --> 00:22.300
# She said you're...
you're one in a million #

00:22.335 --> 00:24.565
# You've got
to burn to shine #

00:24.600 --> 00:27.600
# But you were
born under a bad sign #

00:27.635 --> 00:30.367
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

00:30.402 --> 00:33.100
# When you
woke up this morning #

00:33.200 --> 00:36.200
# And all that love
had gone #

00:36.235 --> 00:39.200
# Your papa never
told you about #

00:39.300 --> 00:41.700
# Right and wrong #

00:41.800 --> 00:44.100
# But you're...
you're lookin' good, baby #

00:44.135 --> 00:46.617
# I believe that
you're feelin' fine #

00:46.652 --> 00:49.100
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

00:49.200 --> 00:51.665
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

00:51.700 --> 00:54.900
- # So sing it now #
- # Woke up this morning #

00:55.000 --> 00:58.500
# Got a blue moon...
got a blue moon in your eyes, yeah #

00:58.600 --> 01:00.500
# Woke up this morning #

01:02.500 --> 01:05.800
# You say you woke up
this morning #

01:05.900 --> 01:07.965
# The world
turned upside down #

01:08.000 --> 01:10.200
# Lordy, well,
things ain't been the same #

01:10.300 --> 01:13.565
# Since the blues
walked in our town #

01:13.600 --> 01:16.000
# But you're... but you're
one in a million #

01:16.035 --> 01:18.400
# 'Cause you got that
shotgun shine #

01:18.500 --> 01:21.500
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

01:21.535 --> 01:24.500
# With a blue moon
in your eyes, yeah #

01:24.535 --> 01:27.465
# Woke up
this morning #

01:27.500 --> 01:30.665
- # Uh-huh #
- # And got yourself a gun #

01:30.700 --> 01:33.700
- # Woke up this morning #
- # Got yourself a gun #

01:33.735 --> 01:36.200
- # Uh-huh #
- # Got yourself a gun. #

01:56.700 --> 01:58.500
What the fuck?

02:07.700 --> 02:09.900
Aw, shit!

02:28.200 --> 02:30.365
So, Bundino,

02:30.400 --> 02:32.065
why you fuck me
like this?

02:32.100 --> 02:33.965
What the fuck you
talkin' about?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.765
I got a whole leg
covered with Neosporin.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.800
I just spent an hour with the cops
explainin' how it went down.

02:39.835 --> 02:42.165
I no forget you
professional criminal.

02:42.200 --> 02:45.300
Let me ask you somethin'.
If I really wanted to rob you,

02:45.335 --> 02:47.500
you think I'd have to put
up with this bullshit?

02:47.600 --> 02:49.900
Well, just so you know.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.265
I didn't take
your truck.

02:54.300 --> 02:56.700
I lost my study guide,
my fuckin' flashcards.

02:58.200 --> 03:01.700
I'm sick of this fuckin'
prejudice against ex-cons.

03:01.735 --> 03:05.200
I never hire you if I no need
Tony Soprano for union.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.800
Not for him, I show
you the fucking window.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.200
Great.

03:16.300 --> 03:18.200
Hey, I thought you
liked the other one.

03:18.235 --> 03:21.300
The Corn Pops.
Here, take it.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.365
What, no juice either?

03:24.400 --> 03:25.965
I told you,
write it down.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.165
I'll have the girl
pick up whatever you want.

03:28.200 --> 03:31.300
She doesn't know the difference between
fruit roll-ups and Pop-Tarts.

03:31.335 --> 03:33.265
I know, everybody's
an idiot to you.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.800
You know they got
these places called supermarkets

03:35.835 --> 03:38.300
where you go, and you buy
the things that you like.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.800
I'll reimburse you.

03:40.900 --> 03:43.100
And when am I
supposed to do that?

03:43.200 --> 03:46.400
Well, as far as I can tell,
you spend most of your time on the phone

03:46.500 --> 03:49.500
or sittin' on the couch perfecting
that pissy look on your face.

03:49.535 --> 03:51.700
Add coming home drunk,
sounds like you.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.800
- What the fuck did you say to me?
- Let the fuck go of me.

03:57.835 --> 03:59.565
Or what?
Or what?

03:59.600 --> 04:01.500
One of these days,
you wait,

04:01.535 --> 04:03.400
I'm gonna kick
your fuckin' ass.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.600
What's wrong with
right now then, huh?

04:05.700 --> 04:08.600
What's wrong with right now?
Come on!

04:13.800 --> 04:15.800
Blah.

04:24.300 --> 04:26.000
Now you got nothin'.

04:34.300 --> 04:36.500
# Angels sent you #

04:39.200 --> 04:41.700
# I've searched
everywhere #

04:41.735 --> 04:44.200
# Just to find someone... #

04:47.200 --> 04:49.565
- Thank you, Mary.
- You're welcome.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.700
I hated to call you in but I got
this midterm report

04:52.735 --> 04:55.800
from Mr. Fiske,
Anthony's English teacher.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.600
And, uh, well, it doesn't hit the mail
for a few days

04:59.635 --> 05:01.700
and I thought maybe
we could get a jump on it

05:01.735 --> 05:03.700
and avert any real crisis.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.400
Wonderful,
another crisis.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.350
He's still well below
the C average

05:07.385 --> 05:09.200
he needs for the colleges
we discussed.

05:09.300 --> 05:12.400
There is also an issue

05:12.500 --> 05:14.800
with his five
paragraph essay.

05:14.900 --> 05:17.365
"Animal Farm"?

05:17.400 --> 05:20.200
Anthony submitted
his one-line topic late.

05:20.235 --> 05:21.800
Then two drafts.

05:21.900 --> 05:24.850
The first was
apparently sketchy.

05:24.885 --> 05:27.800
The second,
Fiske said, was...

05:27.835 --> 05:30.100
"suspiciously cogent. "

05:31.200 --> 05:33.165
Plagiarism.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.565
He thinks
my son cheated?

05:35.600 --> 05:38.800
He spent almost an entire Saturday
afternoon at the library.

05:38.835 --> 05:42.000
- I think it's obvious what's going on.
- What do you mean?

05:42.100 --> 05:45.000
Anyone else shows sudden
improvement, he gets a gold star.

05:45.035 --> 05:46.700
My son gets
his act together

05:46.800 --> 05:48.550
and suddenly
he's a cheater?

05:48.585 --> 05:50.265
I know what
people think, Bob.

05:50.300 --> 05:52.900
Italian-American, father
in the carting industry...

05:53.000 --> 05:54.700
Are you suggesting
some sort of bias?

05:54.800 --> 05:56.565
Because that's
a very serious charge.

05:56.600 --> 05:59.465
I have met this Mr. Fiske.
He's a cold fish.

05:59.500 --> 06:02.100
Couldn't you or one
of the other teachers talk to him?

06:02.200 --> 06:03.900
Tell him how hard
AJ's trying?

06:06.500 --> 06:08.600
Nothing will make
a better argument

06:08.635 --> 06:10.967
than continued effort
on AJ's part.

06:11.002 --> 06:13.265
But hey, there...
there's still a shot.

06:13.300 --> 06:16.300
This semester's grade
is heavily weighted on their term paper

06:16.335 --> 06:19.300
- on "Lord of the Flies. "
- My stomach is in knots.

06:23.700 --> 06:27.000
That's why I thought it important
that you come in.

06:31.300 --> 06:34.000
Though it...

06:34.100 --> 06:36.500
did take me about an hour
to decide what to wear.

06:36.535 --> 06:38.765
Me too.

06:38.800 --> 06:41.900
Does that mean
you've thought about my dinner offer?

06:41.935 --> 06:44.565
I probably
shouldn't say this

06:44.600 --> 06:47.200
but I have thought
about nothing else since you called.

06:47.300 --> 06:50.165
Well, we can't do justice

06:50.200 --> 06:52.800
to any discussion of "Madame Bovary"
over the phone.

06:52.900 --> 06:55.500
That's the thing though.
That book was way over my head.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.300
Why would you even be interested
in someone like me?

06:59.400 --> 07:02.150
Because of just that.
I mean, who admits this stuff?

07:02.185 --> 07:04.900
Not only are you very attractive,
you're unpretentious,

07:04.935 --> 07:07.117
- you say what's on your mind.
- So a big mouth.

07:07.152 --> 07:09.300
I see how that would
attract a man like you.

07:09.335 --> 07:12.300
So, should we grab
a meal or not?

07:12.400 --> 07:16.065
Well, there are other things
to think about. My husband for one.

07:16.100 --> 07:19.400
Your husband's gonna have to get used
to the idea that your life is moving on.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.400
I'm not worried
about my life.

07:22.435 --> 07:25.265
Oh!

07:25.300 --> 07:26.965
You know what?
Call me naive,

07:27.000 --> 07:29.900
but in this day and age
I don't really think your husband...

07:30.000 --> 07:33.600
if he found out... is going to break
his son's teacher's legs.

07:33.700 --> 07:35.365
Not to mention
how that would play

07:35.400 --> 07:37.600
in the admissions office
at Arizona State.

07:43.300 --> 07:45.700
I don't get it.
What's so funny about that?

07:49.800 --> 07:52.200
Honey, aren't you gonna
eat something?

07:52.300 --> 07:53.865
Janice made lasagna.

07:53.900 --> 07:56.600
It's not so great but you need
something on your stomach.

07:56.635 --> 07:59.700
We're gonna go.
Got to stop at my mother's.

07:59.735 --> 08:01.700
Gwen just told us
how you met.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.000
They let you use
the internet in the can?

08:04.035 --> 08:05.800
They let you
post an ad.

08:05.900 --> 08:08.700
I got to read some of that shit.
I bet it's hysterical.

08:08.735 --> 08:11.565
He's, uh...

08:11.600 --> 08:14.000
trying to concentrate.

08:14.100 --> 08:16.400
"Vascular Physiology. "

08:17.400 --> 08:19.600
"Neurotomy. "

08:19.635 --> 08:21.600
Shit.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.965
T made it out like
it was a big gym test.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.800
Some people don't realize
what massage involves.

08:26.900 --> 08:29.800
I'm practically doin' two years
of medical school on my own right now.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.800
One thing I learned
in recovery,

08:31.835 --> 08:33.700
other people's
definitions of you,

08:33.799 --> 08:36.799
sometimes they're more
about makin' themselves feel better.

08:36.835 --> 08:38.600
You got to define
yourself.

08:38.700 --> 08:40.600
Keep your eye
on the tiger, man.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.700
- See you, Tony.
- Bye.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.800
I suppose I could speak
with Monsignor Bava,

08:49.835 --> 08:51.765
have him call
his nephew at Kmart.

08:51.800 --> 08:54.065
That'll fix us in
the Huggies department.

08:54.100 --> 08:57.400
Well, the diaper drive
covers "Clothe the naked. "

08:57.435 --> 08:59.365
What do you say we
work on "Feed the hungry"?

08:59.400 --> 09:02.300
- This looks delicious.
- Thanks for inviting me, Carm.

09:02.335 --> 09:04.300
Pleasant surprise,
indeed.

09:04.400 --> 09:07.850
So, how goes life
these days?

09:07.885 --> 09:11.242
Actually, I think
I met somebody.

09:11.277 --> 09:14.565
- Really?
- Just kind of happened.

09:14.600 --> 09:17.400
We had been working
on this project together

09:17.435 --> 09:19.967
and suddenly
we both realized

09:20.002 --> 09:22.500
that there were
certain feelings.

09:23.900 --> 09:25.900
And I like him
as a person too, of course.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.600
Don't get me wrong.

09:27.700 --> 09:30.000
The funny thing is,
I was sure he was gay.

09:30.035 --> 09:32.400
He sort of reminded
me of you.

09:32.500 --> 09:36.100
He's an intellectual.
You know what I mean?

09:36.135 --> 09:38.617
Anyway, we had been
friends, I guess,

09:38.652 --> 09:41.065
and then he called
to ask me out.

09:41.100 --> 09:44.500
And suddenly
all the formality dropped away.

09:44.535 --> 09:46.900
When I saw him
the other day,

09:47.000 --> 09:50.100
he looked at me
with this intensity.

09:50.135 --> 09:51.465
Now I know it's wrong,

09:51.500 --> 09:53.200
but the truth is,
I feel it too.

09:56.500 --> 09:59.265
You know, if you really
want to discuss this,

09:59.300 --> 10:02.200
I think we should include Tony
in the conversation as well.

10:04.100 --> 10:07.100
Why are you sounding,
I don't know, kind of hostile?

10:07.135 --> 10:09.000
I'm not.

10:10.100 --> 10:12.000
Perhaps that's
your sin talking.

10:12.035 --> 10:13.865
This is none of
Tony's business.

10:13.900 --> 10:17.100
Who knows what he's been up to, and not
just during the separation either.

10:17.135 --> 10:20.300
That doesn't change the fact you made
a commitment to each other before God.

10:20.335 --> 10:23.400
Maybe you should send the papal nuncio
to Tony and remind him of that.

10:23.435 --> 10:26.100
Why am I the only one held
to any kind of standards?

10:26.135 --> 10:28.217
And for that matter,
if this is wrong,

10:28.252 --> 10:30.300
why did God put
this man in my life?

10:30.400 --> 10:33.100
Is it God that
put him there?

10:33.200 --> 10:36.000
Or is there a particular
need you have right now?

10:36.035 --> 10:38.000
See, I never
understand this.

10:38.100 --> 10:40.500
Didn't He put
the need there?

10:46.900 --> 10:48.500
Say when, señor.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.800
You!
Office!

10:59.000 --> 11:01.200
5:15, I haven't
punched in yet.

11:01.235 --> 11:02.800
This is still
my time.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.165
Yeah?

11:13.200 --> 11:16.800
I give you a hard time
about my truck the other day.

11:16.835 --> 11:19.500
Cops find two kids...

11:19.600 --> 11:21.300
Feel free to apologize
any time.

11:21.400 --> 11:23.200
Anyway, they investigate.

11:23.300 --> 11:24.900
Could be joyride.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.500
But I think maybe
behind it

11:27.600 --> 11:29.265
is my cousin
in the north side.

11:29.300 --> 11:32.500
- You know if they found my books?
- Who knows?

11:36.400 --> 11:38.750
You study hard
for massage, yeah?

11:38.785 --> 11:41.100
The licensing test
is pretty hard.

11:41.135 --> 11:42.865
Huge failure rate.

11:42.900 --> 11:44.900
If you pass, then what
you do with this?

11:46.500 --> 11:48.565
Be a professional masseur.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.900
You no think of
massage "kageh"?

11:50.935 --> 11:53.100
You know,
small sauna.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.900
Yeah, I could see it.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.800
Four or five tables,
soothing atmosphere.

11:57.835 --> 12:00.065
Pipe in a little
Keith Jarrett.

12:00.100 --> 12:02.600
First thing, I get
stuck with you. I think,

12:02.700 --> 12:04.765
"Oh, shit. God damn it.

12:04.800 --> 12:07.800
He lazy American
and criminal.

12:07.900 --> 12:09.165
No good for Kim. "

12:09.200 --> 12:12.900
But you work
for Kim and future.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.200
Like Korean people.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.117
I wouldn't say that.

12:17.152 --> 12:18.965
I come from Korea.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.200
Only new shoes
and uncle's address.

12:22.235 --> 12:24.900
Worse than prison.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.700
But I become
"jah-soo-suhng-gah," the boss.

12:28.735 --> 12:31.065
That's why I try
to help you.

12:31.100 --> 12:34.200
Help me how?
What are you talking about?

12:34.235 --> 12:37.300
I stake you the money
in a storefront.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.765
I got a travel agency

12:42.800 --> 12:45.965
in mini-mall over
at West Caldwell.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.600
Shitty business with
a fucking three-year lease.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.765
You know, my daughter,

12:56.800 --> 12:59.600
very interested in massage.

12:59.700 --> 13:02.300
Physical therapy.
Top two-thirds class.

13:02.400 --> 13:05.000
Good for her.
It's a tough nut to crack.

13:05.035 --> 13:07.600
She no like physical
therapy no more.

13:07.700 --> 13:09.965
Cripple people
make her sad.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.900
Now, she watch TV,
live at home, do nothing.

13:13.935 --> 13:17.800
You pass test then you,
me, my daughter,

13:17.900 --> 13:20.400
we make the big
success journey.

13:20.435 --> 13:22.200
Okay?

13:23.800 --> 13:25.400
Jesus.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.500
Yeah, all right.

13:28.500 --> 13:31.200
I don't know
what to say, Kim.

13:31.235 --> 13:33.100
Thanks.

13:40.300 --> 13:43.900
I laid it out for him.
He wants to move back here.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.900
- It's got to be with your approval.
- This was your idea?

13:47.900 --> 13:49.965
It was mutual.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.800
He's upset 'cause you don't get
the kind of cereal he likes.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.100
He threw it in the sink.
How am I supposed to focus

13:55.200 --> 13:57.650
at school with no breakfast?
I got dizzy.

13:57.685 --> 14:00.100
I'm sorry.
I don't see why the two of you

14:00.200 --> 14:02.100
can't work this out
between yourselves.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.300
Well maybe I don't
want to live

14:04.400 --> 14:07.150
in a place where people
use violence against children.

14:07.185 --> 14:09.900
Violence? You're lucky I didn't
put my shoe up your ass.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.365
You see? Now that's abuse.
I know what my rights are.

14:12.400 --> 14:15.200
I can call social services
and they'll send a case worker.

14:15.235 --> 14:17.200
Go ahead!
He'll get the other shoe!

14:18.600 --> 14:21.165
- This is demoralizin'.
- Well, now maybe you see...

14:21.200 --> 14:24.400
That a son of mine would even consider
callin' in the authorities!

14:26.000 --> 14:28.300
- Go ahead, live where you want.
- Fine.

14:28.335 --> 14:30.500
Family meeting?

14:30.600 --> 14:33.400
- Try to stay awake, AJ.
- Keep walkin'.

14:36.400 --> 14:39.265
I just want
my old room back.

14:39.300 --> 14:42.000
You wanted to live with your father.
Live with your decision.

14:42.100 --> 14:45.200
- I don't like it there.
- Funny, I thought I was the problem.

14:45.300 --> 14:47.800
- I make you miserable, remember?
- I never said that.

14:47.900 --> 14:50.400
- You did.
- Absolutely.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.665
For me to even consider
having you back,

15:02.700 --> 15:05.900
we're gonna have to establish
some non-negotiable ground rules.

15:05.935 --> 15:08.300
- Like what kind?
- Let your mother talk.

15:10.500 --> 15:13.100
First and foremost,
school comes first.

15:13.200 --> 15:16.100
That means putting the brakes
on your social life...

15:16.135 --> 15:18.400
parties, phone calls,
Devin.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.265
You are at a crisis point
grade-wise,

15:21.300 --> 15:24.200
so you will make sure that your work
is done on time and correctly.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.800
All right.

15:28.900 --> 15:31.065
I will not tolerate
cursing.

15:31.100 --> 15:34.700
After 16 years of uninterrupted potty
mouth from you people, I get slammed?

15:34.735 --> 15:36.900
This is my house.
You will treat me with respect.

15:36.935 --> 15:38.900
Is that it?

15:43.800 --> 15:46.900
I want you to involve me
in your life a little.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.100
All right, fine.

15:57.400 --> 16:00.100
All right.
Go get your stuff from the car.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.700
We played
that just right.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
I think his time
over there with me

16:31.035 --> 16:33.000
whipped him
into shape a little.

16:33.035 --> 16:34.965
Hmm.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.600
I think you'll see
a difference.

16:48.200 --> 16:52.100
Which muscles attach
to the coracoid process?

16:52.135 --> 16:53.600
Okay, I fucking
know this.

16:53.700 --> 16:56.050
It's on the tip
of my tongue.

16:56.085 --> 16:58.400
Oh, fucking study
hall again.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.900
Vito, where the fuck
is my Tupperware?

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Keep your shirt on. My wife's bringing
it down this afternoon.

17:04.035 --> 17:07.599
Pectoralis minor
and the coracobrachialis, of course.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.400
And?

17:10.800 --> 17:14.099
- Come on. Even I know this.
- Fuck, fine, what is it?

17:14.200 --> 17:16.665
- Biceps!
- What the fuck?

17:16.700 --> 17:19.900
Oh, fuck, I knew that.
My mind's all over the place.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.565
Fear knocked at the door.
Faith answered.

17:22.599 --> 17:24.900
- There was no one there.
- Why do you want to do this shit?

17:24.935 --> 17:26.599
So you can touch
a bunch a strangers?

17:26.700 --> 17:28.400
You really skeeve
the human body, don't you?

17:28.500 --> 17:30.800
You like this so much,
let me ask you a question.

17:30.900 --> 17:32.900
Why do pissing,
shitting and fucking

17:33.000 --> 17:34.665
all happen within
a two-inch radius?

17:34.700 --> 17:37.700
Everybody asks that, Paulie.
There's no answer for it.

17:37.735 --> 17:39.200
They're all sources
of pleasure, though.

17:39.235 --> 17:40.800
Get the fuck out of here!

17:40.900 --> 17:43.100
I know this shit and then
the next minute it's gone.

17:43.135 --> 17:44.900
I don't know how you
do it working full time.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.865
If your parole
officer's a problem,

17:46.900 --> 17:49.265
give our guy Jimmy Curran a call.
He's a supervisor.

17:49.300 --> 17:53.100
It's not that. It's all this pressure
now that I got this opportunity.

17:53.135 --> 17:54.800
Sungyon Kim, my boss,

17:54.900 --> 17:57.700
he's going to back me on
a whole storefront operation.

17:57.800 --> 17:59.400
The Korean?

17:59.500 --> 18:01.600
You're looking for money,
why not come to me?

18:01.700 --> 18:03.665
Well, this is different.

18:03.700 --> 18:06.865
This self-owned
business shit

18:06.900 --> 18:09.250
is like a religion
to these people.

18:09.285 --> 18:11.600
Plus, the guy sees
something in me.

18:13.800 --> 18:16.400
You know, in some ways,

18:16.500 --> 18:19.500
the whole prison thing
is not that different

18:19.535 --> 18:21.700
from being an immigrant.

18:22.800 --> 18:26.500
Word to the wise:
remember Pearl Harbor.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.300
We really were
the last people in there.

18:30.300 --> 18:32.265
At least they were
subtle about it.

18:32.300 --> 18:34.800
Was it the stacking
the chairs or running the vacuum?

18:51.400 --> 18:53.250
Relax.

18:53.285 --> 18:55.100
Sorry.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.050
"Madame Bovary. "

18:58.085 --> 18:59.665
It's a first edition.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.700
Well, Modern Library's
first edition.

19:02.900 --> 19:04.900
Thank you.
That is so sweet.

19:06.900 --> 19:08.500
Honestly, though,
I don't know.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.200
The story's very slow.

19:10.300 --> 19:11.765
Nothing really happens.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.100
I think he could've
said what he has to say

19:14.200 --> 19:16.600
- with a lot less words.
- Outside nothing happens.

19:16.700 --> 19:18.900
But inside she has these extremes
of boredom

19:19.000 --> 19:21.065
and exhilaration.

19:21.100 --> 19:23.100
You should
try it again.

19:24.400 --> 19:27.265
And what a wonderful thing
to have in a den.

19:27.300 --> 19:31.000
You know, you look really
beautiful in this light.

19:36.400 --> 19:39.100
I don't do this a lot.

19:39.135 --> 19:40.500
Do what?

19:41.800 --> 19:44.350
Sitting in a car,
with a man,

19:44.385 --> 19:46.900
not really knowing
what to do,

19:46.935 --> 19:49.800
or if I should at all.

19:49.900 --> 19:52.000
And feeling like
some teenager

19:52.100 --> 19:53.800
which was,
believe it or not...

20:08.600 --> 20:10.265
I have to tell you.

20:10.300 --> 20:13.500
I haven't been
with anyone.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.465
You're a virgin?

20:15.500 --> 20:17.700
This is my
lucky night.

20:17.735 --> 20:19.900
Stop with the jokes.

20:36.700 --> 20:38.500
I'm so glad
you're here.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.600
So, how was it?

22:16.635 --> 22:18.600
Oh, cut it out.

22:19.900 --> 22:23.300
So, what is "Abelard
and Heloise"?

22:23.335 --> 22:25.000
It looks religious.

22:25.100 --> 22:26.800
I just like
to read in there.

22:29.900 --> 22:32.500
It's the classic story.

22:32.600 --> 22:35.900
A 12th century scholar
falls in love with his underage student,

22:35.935 --> 22:38.000
gets her pregnant.

22:38.100 --> 22:39.900
God, in the 12th century?

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
And they're found out.

22:42.100 --> 22:44.800
And her uncle, the abbot,
has him castrated.

22:46.900 --> 22:49.465
It's timeless, really.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.965
Even though he becomes
a monk and she a nun,

22:52.000 --> 22:55.400
their passion burns on through
these incredible letters

22:55.435 --> 22:57.400
through the rest
of their lives.

22:57.435 --> 23:00.300
You, with these books.

23:00.400 --> 23:02.500
Education should
never stop.

23:02.600 --> 23:05.200
It enriches
all aspects of life.

23:05.300 --> 23:07.200
Hmm, I know.

23:08.800 --> 23:11.965
I wish someone could
convince AJ of that.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.665
I keep thinking he could
start over in college

23:14.700 --> 23:17.100
but who knows if he's even
going to get the chance?

23:17.135 --> 23:20.200
He will.
All our students matriculate.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.700
You got to be fucking kidding me.
No way!

24:55.300 --> 24:57.400
Why do they take so long?
All they have to do

24:57.435 --> 24:59.500
is spit out the results.

24:59.600 --> 25:02.000
5-6-2-4-7-

25:02.035 --> 25:04.400
3-7-32-11.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.565
That's me.
Blundetto.

25:06.600 --> 25:09.400
I'm only authorized
to inform you that your score

25:09.435 --> 25:12.200
meets or exceeds
the required minimum for licensure.

25:12.235 --> 25:14.700
And you're now board
certified in massage

25:14.800 --> 25:16.800
and body work by
the state of New Jersey.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.800
Honey, you passed.

25:20.900 --> 25:22.400
You passed!

25:23.900 --> 25:25.900
Oh Jesus.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.600
I couldn't have
done it alone.

25:33.500 --> 25:35.500
Oh my God,
look at you.

25:35.535 --> 25:37.700
You did it, baby.

25:37.735 --> 25:39.665
You did it.

25:39.700 --> 25:43.200
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

25:43.300 --> 25:46.000
It's been a month since
my last confession.

25:46.035 --> 25:49.700
- Carmela?
- I had sex with that man.

25:54.300 --> 25:57.350
I know we talked
about commitment,

25:57.385 --> 26:00.400
the sacrament
of marriage, but...

26:02.700 --> 26:04.765
I don't know.

26:04.800 --> 26:07.000
- You sound remorseful.
- I am.

26:07.035 --> 26:08.765
I'm also confused,
though.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.100
The truth is I have been
walking around on a cloud,

26:11.135 --> 26:12.900
like Maria in
"West Side Story. "

26:16.900 --> 26:19.365
It's not right.

26:19.400 --> 26:22.800
Have you heard of
"Abelard and Eloise"?

26:22.835 --> 26:24.665
I think it's "Heloise. "

26:24.700 --> 26:26.700
And from what I remember
it ends badly.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.765
I know, exactly.

26:28.800 --> 26:32.200
But, something in me
has been reawakened.

26:33.500 --> 26:36.500
And even if it never
happens again with this man,

26:36.535 --> 26:38.817
just knowing that
feeling of passion again,

26:38.852 --> 26:41.676
I don't know
if it's ever going to go away.

26:41.711 --> 26:44.500
- I'll need it.
- If it never happens again?

26:44.535 --> 26:46.817
Carmela, I can't
absolve you of a sin

26:46.852 --> 26:49.100
you're going
to continue to commit.

26:49.135 --> 26:51.367
You need to show
resolve,

26:51.402 --> 26:53.651
a firm purpose
to change.

26:53.686 --> 26:55.900
Yeah, I know,
I know.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
So, this man takes
you to restaurants,

26:59.100 --> 27:01.700
fulfills certain
physical desires,

27:01.735 --> 27:03.465
tells jokes.

27:03.500 --> 27:05.900
But will he be there
beyond the here and now?

27:05.935 --> 27:08.300
When you're too old
to walk to the bathroom,

27:08.400 --> 27:10.450
will he be there
to help you?

27:10.485 --> 27:12.500
What, and you
think Tony will?

27:12.535 --> 27:14.900
Carmela,
you took a vow.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.465
You both did.

27:17.500 --> 27:20.800
For your penance, I want you
to do something kind for Tony.

27:20.835 --> 27:23.700
- I don't think I can, Father.
- Then pray for him,

27:23.735 --> 27:26.300
not only that God
will touch his heart

27:26.400 --> 27:29.200
but that He'll
touch yours as well.

27:39.200 --> 27:42.200
It's not much now,
but it's a pretty flexible space.

27:42.235 --> 27:44.100
Plus you got the dog
groomer next door

27:44.200 --> 27:46.100
in case your Korean
friend wants some lunch.

27:46.135 --> 27:48.065
You know they
really do eat dogs.

27:48.100 --> 27:51.100
- Not all of them but I asked Kim.
- Jesus Christ.

27:51.200 --> 27:53.200
I'm thinking of building
a row of rooms here

27:53.300 --> 27:55.300
with different themes.
Asian for shiatsu,

27:55.400 --> 27:57.800
a little Danish
thing for Rolfing,

27:57.900 --> 28:00.700
even though technically
it's Swedish.

28:00.800 --> 28:03.500
Well, sounds like
it's all coming together.

28:04.700 --> 28:06.500
Look, Ton', I know
you're disappointed.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.500
What the fuck you
talking about?

28:08.600 --> 28:11.600
The way things turned out
since I left the can.

28:11.700 --> 28:13.700
Going civilian.

28:17.800 --> 28:21.000
Over here I'm going to put
an oasis with big plants.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.700
Like a waiting area
for the customers.

28:23.735 --> 28:26.265
They could buy some
$30 hand cream

28:26.300 --> 28:28.900
while they look at one
of those fountains with the koi in it.

28:28.935 --> 28:32.100
- I can get you the koi.
- Really, giant carp?

28:32.135 --> 28:34.065
How the fuck
do you get that?

28:34.100 --> 28:36.400
It's done. Don't give
it another thought.

28:36.500 --> 28:38.400
- Tony, you here?
- Up front.

28:38.500 --> 28:40.900
Hey. I came by
to get the keys.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.900
I would have gone by the laundry
but my dad's such a hard-on at work.

28:43.935 --> 28:47.200
Tell me about it.
Amanda, this is my cousin Tony.

28:47.235 --> 28:49.665
- Hey.
- Hey, how are you?

28:49.700 --> 28:52.500
Hey, do you believe there's
a dog groomer there

28:52.600 --> 28:54.600
in case somebody
needs a snack?

28:55.700 --> 28:58.865
Place is nice.
A little paint, maybe...

28:58.900 --> 29:02.200
- Amanda, This is my cousin Christopher.
- Hey.

29:02.235 --> 29:05.700
So, I met this guy
at a club on Canal.

29:05.800 --> 29:08.065
He says he can hook
us up with ginseng,

29:08.100 --> 29:10.150
fake rhino, nerve tea,
all that herbal shit.

29:10.185 --> 29:12.165
We could keep it up front
with the koi thing.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.700
- If we're still doing that.
- Koi's taken care of.

29:14.800 --> 29:18.500
Well, I got to book.
Nice meeting you guys.

29:22.300 --> 29:24.250
What's she here for,
happy endings?

29:24.285 --> 29:26.165
She's not going
to do massage at all.

29:26.200 --> 29:28.800
She's Kim's daughter.
She's trying to find herself.

29:28.835 --> 29:30.400
She'll do the books
and shit.

29:30.435 --> 29:31.965
Oh. Nice ass.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.600
Those ceiling tiles
come right out

29:33.700 --> 29:35.565
so I can install
the sound system myself.

29:35.600 --> 29:38.500
Think you could put in a word
with number one daughter there?

29:38.535 --> 29:41.600
- For what?
- Get some of that Kung Pao kootchie.

29:41.700 --> 29:44.400
You fucking guys,
this is important to me.

29:47.600 --> 29:49.800
Sex agrees with you.
You look great.

29:49.835 --> 29:51.465
You're being
discreet, right?

29:51.500 --> 29:54.500
Well, sneaking around
is actually half the fun.

29:54.600 --> 29:56.965
It's like you
have this secret,

29:57.000 --> 29:59.600
you know, you want
to scream to the world.

29:59.635 --> 30:02.200
Yeah, but do yourself
a favor, though, huh?

30:02.235 --> 30:05.000
- Yeah.
- So, how was it?

30:06.000 --> 30:09.100
Uh, I will say that
he took his time.

30:09.200 --> 30:11.300
Oh, you're not
getting off that easy.

30:11.335 --> 30:13.100
Come on, details.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.200
- Hello there.
- Hey, AJ.

30:15.300 --> 30:17.100
Hey, Aunt Ro.

30:17.200 --> 30:19.700
How was school?

30:19.735 --> 30:21.700
It sucked.

30:21.800 --> 30:24.600
Mr. Wegler pulled me
out of language lab

30:24.635 --> 30:26.100
to go over my term
paper notes.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.665
I didn't have
my stuff with me

30:27.700 --> 30:29.500
so he puts his faggy
hand on my shoulder

30:29.600 --> 30:31.265
and says "Do your
best. "

30:31.300 --> 30:33.300
That's his job,
to get you into college.

30:33.400 --> 30:35.065
Or maybe he's
just a big homo.

30:35.100 --> 30:37.965
Could be.
I'm making ziti for dinner.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.500
Go start your assignments.
I will call you.

30:40.600 --> 30:42.765
Could I watch
TV first?

30:42.800 --> 30:45.100
Promise me you're
going to work later.

30:45.135 --> 30:47.400
- But you got to help me.
- I will.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.665
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, my Jackie.
- Oh, honey.

31:02.700 --> 31:06.000
They never caught those goddamn
Chinks who killed him.

31:07.300 --> 31:09.600
Oh my God.
It hurts.

31:12.300 --> 31:15.900
So I'm finding the other copy
when Gene the actuary

31:15.935 --> 31:18.300
- completely unloads on me.
- Jerk.

31:18.400 --> 31:21.400
Like yelling is going to make me
do anything but screw up more.

31:21.500 --> 31:24.300
You know you have to remember
that when you're the boss.

31:24.400 --> 31:26.900
The boss.
It's amazing, isn't it?

31:37.300 --> 31:39.800
Jerks.
Garbage pails are right there.

31:44.500 --> 31:46.200
Come on.

31:53.100 --> 31:55.350
- Holy fuck!
- What?!

31:55.385 --> 31:57.600
Oh my God,
is it a fetus?

31:59.900 --> 32:02.500
- Oh my God!
- Shh!

32:04.000 --> 32:07.500
- It's crack, or crank maybe.
- They were drug dealers?

32:07.600 --> 32:11.000
Yeah, they were probably thinking
they were being tailed by the cops.

32:11.100 --> 32:13.000
Honey, your parole.

32:15.200 --> 32:17.700
Happy?
Come on.

32:25.600 --> 32:28.100
I have never seen
that much money before.

32:28.200 --> 32:29.865
There's got to be
10-12 grand.

32:29.900 --> 32:33.400
Look at this.
You're doubly blessed.

32:35.300 --> 32:38.300
You're right.
Kim, now this.

32:39.300 --> 32:41.500
I am going
to buy you a ring.

32:43.100 --> 32:45.700
You are the sweetest,
sweetest man.

32:47.300 --> 32:49.550
But you should put
it into the business.

32:49.585 --> 32:51.800
See, I got to start
thinking like that.

32:51.835 --> 32:53.900
It's a learning curve.

32:58.100 --> 33:00.600
Well, it seems
to say here

33:00.700 --> 33:04.000
that this Piggy represents
intellectualism over the physical.

33:04.035 --> 33:06.800
So maybe the eyeglasses
are symbolic.

33:06.900 --> 33:09.700
And that's a good topic
for section two in your outline.

33:09.800 --> 33:12.200
AJ!
Wake up!

33:12.300 --> 33:14.500
I'm not going to do
this by myself.

33:14.535 --> 33:16.700
How are you going
to finish this paper?

33:16.735 --> 33:18.500
It's not going
to write itself.

33:24.100 --> 33:26.065
So now this
so-called bag,

33:26.100 --> 33:28.450
you sure it wasn't
on some old lady's arm?

33:28.485 --> 33:30.800
I can't believe she
thought it was a baby.

33:30.835 --> 33:32.617
People do that shit.

33:32.652 --> 33:34.365
12 grand?
Madonn' mi'.

33:34.400 --> 33:37.700
How many guys you got to jerk off
on a massage table to make that?

33:37.735 --> 33:40.100
I don't know.
What do you charge without the table?

33:41.300 --> 33:43.300
Cristal, gentlemen?

33:43.400 --> 33:45.065
Keep it coming,
honey.

33:45.100 --> 33:47.800
From now on, anytime somebody
steps in a pile a shit,

33:47.835 --> 33:49.900
it'll be known
as a Blundetto.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.700
To the Blundetto!

34:01.900 --> 34:03.765
- Oh, wait.
- Oh.

34:03.800 --> 34:06.500
- I'm sorry.
- I wasn't ready.

34:08.199 --> 34:12.800
# Cross over the river,
beyond every cloud #

34:13.800 --> 34:16.500
# She's past the wind #

34:16.600 --> 34:20.665
# Blowing loud #

34:20.699 --> 34:22.900
# Over the mountain #

34:23.000 --> 34:26.900
# A girl waits for me... #

34:29.500 --> 34:31.199
My God, you scared me.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.217
What are you
doing here?

34:33.252 --> 34:35.199
Jesus.
Nice greeting.

34:37.500 --> 34:40.199
How are you?
Everything okay?

34:40.300 --> 34:43.065
AJ left this
in his room.

34:43.100 --> 34:45.100
Thought he might
need it to turn in.

34:47.500 --> 34:49.000
Did you even
look at this?

34:49.100 --> 34:51.500
Who the hell
is Anne Dunham?

34:51.600 --> 34:53.500
How the hell
should I know?

34:53.600 --> 34:56.400
Well, she's obviously
some girl who was an expert

34:56.500 --> 34:58.500
on "Lord of the Flies"
three years ago.

34:58.535 --> 35:00.300
This is an A-plus paper.

35:04.700 --> 35:06.665
Since when
do you eat duck?

35:06.700 --> 35:08.565
I can't believe
he would do this.

35:08.600 --> 35:10.900
Neither can I, considering how tight
he is with money.

35:10.935 --> 35:13.200
That's not what I meant.
You think he bought this?

35:15.200 --> 35:17.200
God damn it!

35:19.100 --> 35:21.065
Hello?

35:21.100 --> 35:24.000
Hi, I was just laying here
thinking about you.

35:24.100 --> 35:26.265
What are you wearing?

35:26.300 --> 35:29.200
Yes, hello, Mr. Wegler.
I'm afraid now is not a good time.

35:29.235 --> 35:31.365
I'm serious.
I want to know.

35:31.400 --> 35:33.750
Uh, well, yes.
Thank you very much.

35:33.785 --> 35:36.100
I will make sure
that he brings it in.

35:36.200 --> 35:38.300
Okay.
Goodbye, Mr. Wegler.

35:38.400 --> 35:41.500
I made reservations
at that crab place down by the shore.

35:41.535 --> 35:43.700
Dinner and a little
night swimming.

35:43.735 --> 35:45.600
Right, okay.
Thank you.

35:47.300 --> 35:49.100
What did
that fag want?

35:49.200 --> 35:51.400
Jesus Christ, Tony,
everybody's a fag to you.

35:51.500 --> 35:53.600
Maybe you're a fag,
you ever think about that?

35:53.700 --> 35:55.700
Can I help it if I know one
when I see one?

35:55.800 --> 35:58.100
Really? What are the signs...
education, culture?

35:58.200 --> 35:59.800
Sucking a guy's cock
usually tips me off.

35:59.900 --> 36:02.900
How do you know who sucks whose cock?
You got a little secret?

36:03.000 --> 36:05.600
And what do you care,
anyway, if somebody's gay?

36:05.700 --> 36:09.200
It must be some big fear of yours
or you wouldn't talk about it so much.

36:09.235 --> 36:11.600
I forget now. What part of hell
did you say they go to?

36:11.700 --> 36:14.600
Are they with the abortion doctors
or the child molesters?

36:14.635 --> 36:17.467
- That was a long time ago.
- Now you're all open-minded

36:17.502 --> 36:20.300
that you got a couple of friends
that are bologna smokers.

36:20.335 --> 36:22.700
- Right?
- What the fuck are you doing?

36:22.800 --> 36:25.100
Going for a swim.

36:26.500 --> 36:28.900
Would you leave
your goddamn socks here?

36:28.935 --> 36:30.565
Your underpants?

36:30.600 --> 36:35.700
# A girl waits for me. #

36:43.800 --> 36:46.800
Hey, that's some
beautiful suit.

36:46.900 --> 36:49.800
I had to get it.
It went with the shoes.

36:49.900 --> 36:51.600
Whose got those?
Vito's guy?

36:51.700 --> 36:53.265
Vasily's,
custom-made.

36:53.300 --> 36:56.200
Only thing I ever found in the street
is my first wife.

36:58.500 --> 36:59.800
Dealer has 20.

36:59.900 --> 37:01.400
Son of a bitch.

37:01.500 --> 37:03.600
- Whoa.
- I just took a beating at craps.

37:03.700 --> 37:07.100
- How you guys doing?
- Pocahontas here is scalping us.

37:19.100 --> 37:22.000
What's the matter?

37:23.500 --> 37:26.400
Just nothing.
I don't know.

37:26.500 --> 37:30.200
I just keep thinking about AJ
and that girl's paper.

37:30.300 --> 37:33.100
Oh, it's a pretty common thing,
Carm, really.

37:34.500 --> 37:38.050
Honestly, you know, the important thing
is you took a stand.

37:38.085 --> 37:41.600
A lot of parents just take it in stride,
or even condone it.

37:41.635 --> 37:43.565
It's just the cheating,
you know.

37:43.600 --> 37:45.900
It's just not like him.
He's always done his work.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Poorly, a lot
of the time, and late

37:48.100 --> 37:50.300
but he always did it,
he never cheated.

37:50.335 --> 37:52.465
Well, wait.
Didn't I read somewhere

37:52.500 --> 37:54.900
in his record that he stole
a test at Verbum Dei?

37:55.000 --> 37:58.100
Please, no, that was just acting out.
He was with a bad crowd.

37:58.200 --> 38:00.400
They were there to vandalize
the science lab,

38:00.500 --> 38:02.600
but it was locked,
so they stole some tests.

38:02.635 --> 38:05.000
Well, I was
a late bloomer too.

38:05.100 --> 38:06.800
Union college
took a chance on me

38:06.900 --> 38:10.200
because they saw that I had potential,
but I wasn't that mature.

38:10.235 --> 38:13.400
That's all this is.
AJ's just fighting to keep peace

38:13.435 --> 38:15.500
with the kids who seem
further ahead.

38:15.600 --> 38:18.465
You know, you ask me,
I think he was driven to cheating.

38:18.500 --> 38:21.600
It's that-that Mr. Fiske.
He is ridiculous with the pressure.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.600
I mean, how hopeless
would you feel

38:23.700 --> 38:26.300
if you really worked on something
and still got a "D"?

38:26.400 --> 38:29.900
I have been there, Carm.
You're worrying for nothing, I promise.

38:37.700 --> 38:39.700
I have thought
about this all day.

38:39.800 --> 38:43.000
You know I almost called you
from the faculty parking lot.

38:51.600 --> 38:53.650
- Oh, Bob.
- What?

38:53.685 --> 38:55.700
Stop.
Bob, I...

38:56.700 --> 38:58.665
What's the matter?

38:58.700 --> 39:01.400
I can't right now, I'm sorry.
I'm too upset.

39:06.700 --> 39:08.900
Carmela, stay.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.600
What are you doing?

39:10.700 --> 39:12.665
What kind of mother am I?
I mean, look at us.

39:12.700 --> 39:15.600
Do you realize under the laws
of the Church I am still married?

39:15.635 --> 39:18.200
- The Church?
- I can't do this tonight.

39:18.300 --> 39:21.700
- I'm sorry.
- Jesus, Carmela, come on.

39:42.600 --> 39:45.800
# Thrill me, thrill me #

39:45.900 --> 39:50.500
# Walk me down the lane
where shadows will be #

39:50.600 --> 39:54.400
- # Will be, hiding lovers... #

39:54.500 --> 39:57.300
Okay, thanks.
It was a fucking blast.

39:57.335 --> 39:58.917
You sure you don't
want to eat?

39:58.952 --> 40:00.465
Steak and eggs
up by Skyway's.

40:00.500 --> 40:04.300
- Oh, I can't.
- Come on, shut the door.

40:04.400 --> 40:07.100
I'm going to mange then hit the sack
for the next 14 hours.

40:08.700 --> 40:13.900
# They told me be sensible
with your new love. #

40:30.100 --> 40:34.600
Hey, I thought once they move you
upstairs you get to leave early.

40:34.635 --> 40:37.100
No such luck.
Got a second?

40:38.100 --> 40:39.865
The Soprano kid.

40:39.900 --> 40:42.800
How is he doing?
Got his paper yet?

40:42.900 --> 40:44.965
Well, the usual.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.500
Solidly below average.

40:48.500 --> 40:50.265
So what, a "C"?

40:50.300 --> 40:53.400
Well no, that's a little
generous for 10% insight,

40:53.500 --> 40:56.165
- 90% Cliff Notes.
- This is an important class, Tom.

40:56.200 --> 40:59.500
Anything less than a "C" is going
to blow that kid out at Arizona State.

40:59.535 --> 41:01.465
You think it's going
to make a difference?

41:01.500 --> 41:05.300
As dean of college admissions
and head of your department,

41:05.335 --> 41:08.800
I happen to know it's a fact.
He's doing his best.

41:08.835 --> 41:11.365
Well, like my dad
used to say,

41:11.400 --> 41:13.800
"The world needs
ditch diggers too. "

41:13.835 --> 41:15.665
Let me ask you something.

41:15.700 --> 41:19.350
How is floating this kid a C-minus
going to fuck things up here?

41:19.385 --> 41:23.000
AJ Soprano's a spoiled lox.
He'd be lucky to go to a trade school.

41:23.100 --> 41:24.965
It's a D-plus.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.600
Tom, cut him a break.

41:38.400 --> 41:41.300
So what does it mean to the kid
who really breaks his ass in here

41:41.335 --> 41:44.100
if Fredo Corleone can get a "C"
'cause you asked?

41:44.135 --> 41:46.900
Is that what this is about?
His background?

41:52.000 --> 41:53.600
Good night.

41:53.700 --> 41:56.000
I'll be working
over at the place.

41:56.100 --> 41:58.100
That's good dedication.

41:58.135 --> 42:00.200
Way to go.

42:03.900 --> 42:06.265
See, regular people
need a place to relax too.

42:06.300 --> 42:09.150
They can't just hop on a plane
to the Bahamas, right?

42:09.185 --> 42:12.000
Hey, guys, what do you think
of Daddy's business?

42:13.800 --> 42:15.800
Jason, Justin,
I'm talking to you.

42:15.900 --> 42:19.200
- I like it.
- Yeah, it's nice.

42:19.300 --> 42:21.365
Maybe someday when
this thing takes off

42:21.400 --> 42:24.300
you guys can work here,
like as a summer job or something.

42:24.400 --> 42:26.600
Would you like that?
Working with your old man?

42:26.635 --> 42:28.265
Sure.

42:28.300 --> 42:30.365
All right,
put those away.

42:30.400 --> 42:32.800
You got to do your homework
before I take you back

42:32.835 --> 42:34.800
or your mom's going
to kill me.

42:34.900 --> 42:37.900
Mom says we need helmets
to ride the scooters you got us.

42:37.935 --> 42:39.665
We'll stop
at Sports Authority.

42:39.700 --> 42:41.665
- Come on, do your homework.
- Where?

42:41.700 --> 42:44.800
I don't know.
Here, on the floor over there.

43:15.300 --> 43:17.000
Hold it like this.

43:17.100 --> 43:18.900
Ready? Ha!

43:20.800 --> 43:24.000
- That was fast.
- I took a shortcut.

43:35.900 --> 43:38.700
You ever think
of painting that ceiling?

43:38.800 --> 43:40.300
Maybe.

43:40.400 --> 43:43.100
How about a glow-in-the-dark
solar system

43:43.200 --> 43:44.965
like I had in college?

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
- I was thinking blue, maybe.
- Mm.

43:47.100 --> 43:49.800
You know, like when you stick
your hand in the Caribbean.

43:49.900 --> 43:52.000
Oh, yeah.

43:53.600 --> 43:56.100
Do you think Union College
is a good place for AJ?

43:56.135 --> 43:58.017
I don't know.

43:58.052 --> 43:59.865
It could be.

43:59.900 --> 44:01.765
You know, maybe
you could tell them

44:01.800 --> 44:05.000
how he's a lot like you were
when you were his age.

44:05.100 --> 44:07.900
That's a thought.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.200
So have you ever
been to the Caribbean?

44:10.300 --> 44:13.165
Yeah, Barbados once,
years ago.

44:13.200 --> 44:16.165
- Oh, it was beautiful.
- Yeah, it is.

44:16.200 --> 44:20.000
Maybe you could bring up
the fact that he has ADD,

44:20.035 --> 44:22.600
because it's not
the stigma it once was.

44:22.700 --> 44:24.500
That's true.

44:24.535 --> 44:26.300
It isn't.

44:27.300 --> 44:28.800
Where are you going?

44:42.400 --> 44:44.100
Mmm.

44:44.200 --> 44:46.665
Faculty lunch, right?

44:46.700 --> 44:48.900
Patty D'Amico
brought them.

44:55.300 --> 44:57.300
What's the matter,
you okay?

44:57.400 --> 45:00.200
Maybe we should
take a time out.

45:00.235 --> 45:02.665
What?

45:02.700 --> 45:04.365
Really, why?

45:04.400 --> 45:08.300
Because every time I think about putting
the arm on Tom Fiske

45:08.400 --> 45:11.000
I want to poke my eyes out
with a knitting needle.

45:11.100 --> 45:13.500
What does that
have to do with us?

45:13.535 --> 45:16.300
I just think
we should, uh...

45:18.000 --> 45:20.350
not do this.

45:20.385 --> 45:22.292
Oh... no, no.

45:22.327 --> 45:24.200
Here tell me.

45:25.600 --> 45:28.100
I don't know any other way
to put this.

45:28.200 --> 45:29.900
I've been
thinking and...

45:30.900 --> 45:32.565
I don't know, I...

45:32.600 --> 45:35.000
I think you're
a user, Carmela.

45:35.035 --> 45:36.800
What?

45:36.900 --> 45:39.300
Maybe you saw
an opportunity in me

45:39.400 --> 45:41.000
and you just took
what you needed.

45:41.035 --> 45:43.200
Oh, that is not true.

45:43.300 --> 45:45.400
I am here because
I enjoy being with you.

45:45.500 --> 45:47.500
It-it was wonderful,
in fact.

45:47.600 --> 45:50.000
Yeah, it was.
I mean, it is, I know.

45:50.100 --> 45:53.200
How could asking someone you're
with for help be using them?

45:53.235 --> 45:55.200
That's what people do.

46:00.300 --> 46:02.300
Bob, this hurts.

46:05.500 --> 46:09.765
Oh my.
Oh, my stomach. I feel sick.

46:09.800 --> 46:13.100
You strong-armed me using
the only weapon you have... your pussy.

46:13.200 --> 46:16.100
How dare you talk
to me that way?

46:16.200 --> 46:19.200
Okay, let's pretend you don't
know what I'm talking about.

46:19.235 --> 46:22.200
I don't. Of course I don't have
a fucking master's degree.

46:22.300 --> 46:25.700
Leaving me with a massive
hard-on the other night then practically

46:25.735 --> 46:28.400
attacking me sexually
after you got what you wanted.

46:28.500 --> 46:31.600
You know what, Bob?
You are fucked up.

46:31.700 --> 46:33.800
You need help,
you know that?

46:33.900 --> 46:35.900
What a fucking idiot I am!

46:37.900 --> 46:39.465
Take it easy.

46:39.500 --> 46:41.800
Believe it or not,
I thought you cared about me.

46:41.900 --> 46:44.800
- I thought you should know how I feel.
- Fuck you!

46:45.800 --> 46:48.000
You better
watch your step.

46:54.400 --> 46:56.350
Jesus Christ,
it's 4:00 A.M.

46:56.385 --> 46:58.300
Okay, boys,
hands on the table.

47:00.600 --> 47:02.200
Full boat.

47:03.300 --> 47:05.265
Jesus Christ.

47:05.300 --> 47:08.800
- Three fucking jacks over here.
- You just keep jacking, my friend.

47:08.835 --> 47:12.100
- That's it for me. Tapioca.
- You blew the whole 12 grand?

47:12.200 --> 47:15.200
What, are you stupid?
I got $400 left.

47:18.600 --> 47:20.900
I punch-in
in two hours.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
There's no sense
going home.

47:34.500 --> 47:36.000
Oh, fuck.

48:03.100 --> 48:04.700
Hello?

48:04.800 --> 48:07.000
- Hey, hon, I'm over at your mom's.
- Great.

48:07.100 --> 48:09.300
Roadway Express delivered
five massage tables.

48:09.400 --> 48:11.600
There?
They had that address by mistake.

48:11.700 --> 48:13.365
I told them
to deliver here.

48:13.400 --> 48:16.465
They're still in the boxes.
I looked inside though.

48:16.500 --> 48:19.500
They're pretty spiff.
That Salamanca fabric was worth it.

48:19.535 --> 48:22.065
- It's like leather almost.
- Great.

48:22.100 --> 48:25.100
- What's the matter?
- This shit gives me a headache,

48:25.135 --> 48:27.000
details
and all that stuff.

48:27.100 --> 48:30.500
Oh you. It's no big, for gosh sake.
We'll get Rudy's truck.

48:30.600 --> 48:32.965
- Maybe I have a brain tumor.
- Honey, you don't.

48:33.000 --> 48:36.400
I got this headache in my jaw.
I read it in "Time" magazine.

48:36.435 --> 48:38.400
It's really not
that likely, Jeez.

48:38.500 --> 48:41.500
I got to get back to the painting
or I'll never get out of here tonight.

48:41.600 --> 48:46.200
I am so fucking sick and tired of your
gambling and complaining.

48:46.235 --> 48:47.900
I've got a headache!

48:48.000 --> 48:50.100
When I think of me
waiting outside that prison

48:50.200 --> 48:51.900
for you to come out
I want to vomit.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
I am sick!
I'm evil...

48:57.700 --> 49:00.465
Hey, Henry Ford.

49:00.500 --> 49:04.600
Big entrepreneur.
I like color.

49:12.800 --> 49:16.400
My friend Pak come by?
Fix the toilet?

49:16.500 --> 49:19.000
It's not fixed.
He's got to get a fucking part.

49:19.035 --> 49:22.165
Oh, Pak,
he good plumber.

49:22.200 --> 49:24.900
Right over here,
Wes-a Calwell.

49:24.935 --> 49:27.200
"Wes Cahwel, Wes Cahwel. "

49:29.100 --> 49:31.800
West Caldwell.

49:34.300 --> 49:38.700
So, partner,
we open in three day, huh?

49:42.800 --> 49:44.700
You fucking stroll in?

49:44.800 --> 49:47.700
- I'm over here busting my fucking ass!
- You fucking crazy!

49:47.800 --> 49:51.600
I work in your fucking laundry
all fucking day!

49:56.100 --> 49:58.700
You fucking scam artist!

49:58.735 --> 50:00.700
Fuck.

50:13.500 --> 50:15.000
Ah!

50:37.900 --> 50:39.465
The pole is bent.

50:39.500 --> 50:42.100
Somebody been
punching this door?

50:43.800 --> 50:47.000
If you had a man around
you wouldn't need to call me.

50:47.035 --> 50:48.500
Yeah, right.

50:50.700 --> 50:53.800
You're still young, Mel,
a good-looking woman.

50:53.900 --> 50:56.800
There's no reason
you shouldn't move on with your life,

50:56.900 --> 50:58.500
if that's what you want.

51:05.600 --> 51:07.800
Well, there actually
was somebody.

51:11.200 --> 51:13.200
And he seemed
very nice.

51:13.235 --> 51:14.665
Oh, that's good.

51:14.700 --> 51:19.500
He was a wolf
in sheep's clothing.

51:19.600 --> 51:23.300
He made all these accusations
about my character.

51:26.800 --> 51:28.665
Whatever I say,
whatever I do,

51:28.700 --> 51:30.965
because I was married
to a man like Tony,

51:31.000 --> 51:34.900
my motives will always
be called into question.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.700
Well.

52:05.700 --> 52:08.050
Hey.
Sit down.

52:08.085 --> 52:10.400
You want something?

52:14.100 --> 52:15.565
What did you do?

52:15.600 --> 52:18.700
My back.
Fucking job.

52:18.800 --> 52:20.900
A work-related injury.

52:28.200 --> 52:30.600
So, here's the thing.

52:30.700 --> 52:34.100
You mentioned you might need someone
to run the swag airbags.

52:46.300 --> 52:48.900
Bring me a vodka rocks

52:49.000 --> 52:51.600
and get me some kind
of a cushion, will you?

52:54.700 --> 52:56.700
What happened with
the massage parlor?

53:04.800 --> 53:07.700
It's hard doing
business with strangers.

53:18.100 --> 53:20.900
# I got a heart
full of trouble #

53:21.600 --> 53:22.965
# A house full of sin #

53:23.000 --> 53:27.100
# Things are bad
as they ever been #

53:27.200 --> 53:30.565
# If trouble were money #

53:30.600 --> 53:33.500
# I'd have more money
than any man should #

53:36.200 --> 53:40.000
# I'm open for business
in your neighborhood #

53:40.100 --> 53:44.800
# The blues is my business
and business is good #

53:44.835 --> 53:49.067
# If I had a dollar
for every broken heart #

53:49.102 --> 53:53.300
# I'd be drinking fine wine
and eating caviar #

53:53.400 --> 53:55.865
# If trouble were money #

53:55.900 --> 54:00.200
# I'd have more money
than any man should, yeah #

54:02.400 --> 54:06.165
# I'm open for business
in your neighborhood #

54:06.200 --> 54:11.700
# The blues is my business
and business is good, yeah #

54:11.800 --> 54:15.065
# Business
and business is good #

54:15.100 --> 54:20.200
# The blues is my business
and business is good #

54:20.300 --> 54:22.500
# The blues
is my business #

54:23.800 --> 54:26.500
# The blues
is my business #

54:28.600 --> 54:32.600
# I'm open for business
in your neighborhood #

54:32.635 --> 54:36.600
# The blues is my business
and business is good #

54:40.600 --> 54:42.100
# All right #

54:44.300 --> 54:46.400
# Oh, all right,
yeah #

54:49.200 --> 54:51.600
# Hey, hey,
hey, hey. #
