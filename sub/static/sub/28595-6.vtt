00:04.514 --> 00:06.632
Viktor, you awful man.

00:06.633 --> 00:08.311
He drowned, for God's sake.

00:08.336 --> 00:09.879
You don't have
a licence to trade.

00:09.904 --> 00:11.233
Not now you live
inside a red zone.

00:11.257 --> 00:12.616
- What's a red zone?
- Criminal.

00:12.617 --> 00:13.968
The Home Office said
that they'll fund you.

00:13.992 --> 00:15.162
Let's find Ruby.

00:15.187 --> 00:16.279
For God's sake, Bethany!

00:17.217 --> 00:19.576
That is amazing, and
a little bit like spying.

00:19.601 --> 00:21.021
I think I've found
myself a monkey.

00:21.046 --> 00:23.576
I look ahead and see glories!

00:23.601 --> 00:25.874
- What about the disappeared?
- They say they've gone to Erstwhile.

00:25.898 --> 00:27.897
Some people call
this policy genocide.

00:28.061 --> 00:29.824
<i>Transfer Viktor Goraya.</i>

00:29.849 --> 00:31.919
Erstwhile sites
are like tar pits,

00:31.944 --> 00:33.513
you get thrown in
and you disappear.

00:33.538 --> 00:34.919
Do we remember it?

00:34.944 --> 00:37.302
We forget it because it worked.

00:54.904 --> 00:57.450
<i>As 2029 begins, the charter</i>

00:57.475 --> 00:59.818
<i>for the British
Broadcasting Corporation</i>

00:59.843 --> 01:01.832
<i>has been withdrawn.</i>

01:01.857 --> 01:05.615
<i>The BBC is now closed,
leaving a final message:</i>

01:05.616 --> 01:08.707
<i>"Thank you, goodnight
and good luck."</i>

01:08.732 --> 01:10.824
<i>A journalist has been
banned from Downing Street</i>

01:10.849 --> 01:12.607
<i>after challenging
the Prime Minister.</i>

01:12.608 --> 01:14.871
It said that Russia had been
funding the Four Star party.

01:14.896 --> 01:16.619
Ah, fake news. Every time!

01:16.620 --> 01:19.271
Reports of sexual harassment
within Four Star headquarters?

01:19.296 --> 01:20.975
- Pack of lies!
- It's heavily implied

01:21.000 --> 01:23.767
- that the voting was rigged.
- You are the enemy of the people!

01:23.792 --> 01:26.239
Mrs Rook, there are questions
about your income tax return.

01:26.264 --> 01:28.777
This is why journalism is dying!

01:28.802 --> 01:32.675
<i>Mrs Rook has also devoted Â£1
million to the fight against monkey flu.</i>

01:32.700 --> 01:36.559
<i>The epidemic continues to rage,
with an estimated 1,200 dead.</i>

01:37.153 --> 01:39.114
His name's Viktor Goraya.

01:39.341 --> 01:42.317
I know there's 100 Viktor
Gorayas, it's like John Smith.

01:42.342 --> 01:45.536
He's Viktor Rostic Goraya.

01:45.561 --> 01:48.716
He was moved and there's no
record of where he's been moved to.

01:50.241 --> 01:51.347
What the hell?

01:53.627 --> 01:54.630
For sale?

01:54.631 --> 01:55.817
Since when?

01:56.966 --> 01:58.594
Did you see? For sale.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.638
Says who? How
long's that been there?

02:00.639 --> 02:02.005
God knows. No-one told me.

02:02.598 --> 02:04.606
Be fair, it's a
bit of a mansion.

02:04.631 --> 02:06.177
We could all do with the money.

02:06.383 --> 02:07.395
She's not dead.

02:07.420 --> 02:08.594
Her money, not yours.

02:08.619 --> 02:09.643
Don't go buying a yacht.

02:11.488 --> 02:12.598
This is a new one.

02:12.623 --> 02:14.317
Gooseberry and coconut sponge.

02:14.342 --> 02:16.598
Well, that just
sounds ridiculous.

02:18.972 --> 02:19.976
Gran!

02:21.872 --> 02:23.489
For sale, though, really?

02:23.514 --> 02:24.881
Don't you think we
should talk about it?

02:24.905 --> 02:27.231
I thought property
was theft in your book.

02:27.256 --> 02:28.769
Have you got a cough or a cold?

02:28.809 --> 02:29.989
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

02:30.014 --> 02:31.018
We're both good.

02:33.274 --> 02:34.834
You're never going
to leave this place.

02:35.138 --> 02:36.246
Is Bethany in?

02:36.271 --> 02:37.488
She's in her room.

02:37.513 --> 02:39.277
She never comes out, these days.

02:39.302 --> 02:41.129
Tell her she can't skip dinner.

02:41.154 --> 02:43.558
Ruby's got a
surprise, God help us.

02:47.824 --> 02:49.105
Knock, knock.

02:49.347 --> 02:50.793
Why do you never phone me back?

02:50.818 --> 02:51.832
Did you get my messages?

02:53.292 --> 02:54.324
Hold on.

02:56.005 --> 02:57.379
Too many stairs.

03:01.887 --> 03:04.558
I told Fran it's asthma.

03:05.583 --> 03:07.035
She doesn't need to know.

03:08.614 --> 03:12.137
As far as I can work
out, Viktor got moved.

03:12.332 --> 03:14.066
There's no record
of where he's gone,

03:14.091 --> 03:16.145
and that means they've
taken him to an Erstwhile site.

03:16.169 --> 03:17.513
I'm sorry, I've got
too much work.

03:17.537 --> 03:18.816
I really can't help
you any more.

03:18.840 --> 03:21.144
But we know what
those sites are like, Beth.

03:21.169 --> 03:23.169
- Just thought you could do a search...
- Honestly.

03:23.551 --> 03:25.587
I'm sorry, but I can't.

03:25.933 --> 03:28.254
But it's Viktor
we're talking about.

03:28.555 --> 03:31.285
Yeah, but you
never think about me.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.597
This technology is a privilege,

03:33.622 --> 03:35.097
and you made me break the law.

03:35.582 --> 03:37.145
If I get caught,
they'll strip me of this.

03:37.169 --> 03:40.221
Literally, they will pull
the wires out of my body.

03:40.299 --> 03:42.207
- Can they do that?
- The government own this stuff.

03:42.231 --> 03:43.495
It owns me.

03:43.760 --> 03:48.065
And if they cut me off, I'll
go back to being just Bethany.

03:48.660 --> 03:50.268
Nothing wrong with Bethany.

03:51.479 --> 03:52.641
I think she's great.

03:52.862 --> 03:54.174
How would you know?

03:54.491 --> 03:55.511
Huh?

03:55.621 --> 03:57.292
Where were you till I was 18?

03:58.479 --> 04:00.026
You only came
home 'cos you're sick.

04:01.248 --> 04:02.354
Dinner time.

04:06.539 --> 04:07.539
For sale.

04:07.564 --> 04:10.158
Who's stupid idea is that?
This is our inheritance!

04:11.143 --> 04:13.393
I'm warning you, Gran, you
can forget selling this place.

04:13.418 --> 04:15.767
It's not happening
'cos, much as I love you,

04:15.792 --> 04:17.596
you are not living
with me. Here.

04:17.596 --> 04:18.603
I'll buy it.

04:18.629 --> 04:20.057
200 quid, final offer.

04:20.100 --> 04:21.253
All right, 250.

04:21.278 --> 04:26.282
Now, promise me, you lot,
no colds or flu or runny noses.

04:26.307 --> 04:28.854
Oh, that's me murdered.

04:29.605 --> 04:31.745
I've got a mission for you.

04:32.776 --> 04:33.784
Won't be long.

04:33.809 --> 04:37.206
It's like a big chestnut risotto
but it's made out of agitated

04:37.231 --> 04:39.576
bacteria, they've
got a footprint of zero.

04:39.601 --> 04:42.057
Oh, doesn't that sound tasty?

04:42.799 --> 04:44.205
Now, come on.

04:44.628 --> 04:48.252
You can reach in, can you
see, the back of the cupboard?

04:48.892 --> 04:51.439
The old Signor device,
can you reach it?

04:52.030 --> 04:53.377
Good boy.

04:54.869 --> 04:56.142
Now, hold on.

04:58.119 --> 04:59.619
How's it going, Ruby?

04:59.620 --> 05:02.509
Oh, Celeste, sweetheart, have
we put out the wine glasses?

05:02.534 --> 05:04.025
- No.
- Oh...

05:04.524 --> 05:06.244
Right, fine. I'm on it.

05:06.436 --> 05:07.767
Never mind.

05:08.239 --> 05:11.462
How many? What are we, 12?

05:11.495 --> 05:13.690
Yeah, 12. With ten adults.

05:14.118 --> 05:15.416
I hope that includes me?

05:15.441 --> 05:18.112
Yes, you can booze
with the rest of us.

05:18.311 --> 05:22.518
Might be the best way to
experience an agitated chestnut.

05:23.161 --> 05:25.049
What are you doing with Signor?

05:25.314 --> 05:27.260
I'm bringing it back to life.

05:27.384 --> 05:28.604
But you don't need it any more.

05:28.628 --> 05:31.362
The signal's in the air now,
it's in the wires, it's in the walls.

05:31.387 --> 05:33.575
You can speak out loud anywhere.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.362
I like having
something to look at.

05:36.510 --> 05:40.627
I'm not talking to the
walls, like Shirley Valentine.

05:40.962 --> 05:43.587
And I bet that reference
is lost on you lot.

05:43.612 --> 05:48.291
<i>Shirley Valentine, a 1986
play written by Willy Russell.</i>

05:49.219 --> 05:50.251
You see?

05:50.603 --> 05:51.932
My little friend.

05:53.870 --> 05:55.419
It's going to save the world.

05:55.444 --> 05:58.196
It's called electric food
'cos they get water and zap it

05:58.221 --> 06:02.432
to produce hydrogen, which
feeds bacteria which produces this.

06:02.628 --> 06:03.993
A brand-new foodstuff.

06:04.018 --> 06:05.143
It's never been alive.

06:06.010 --> 06:07.401
Why does it taste of chestnuts?

06:07.426 --> 06:08.768
Oh, that's chestnut flavouring.

06:08.940 --> 06:10.221
Which is made of...?

06:10.888 --> 06:11.888
Chestnuts.

06:12.645 --> 06:13.901
What's the point, then?

06:13.926 --> 06:15.378
It's a work in progress.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.622
I bet Viktor's eating worse.

06:17.837 --> 06:20.087
Oh, do we have to? Every time?

06:20.714 --> 06:22.627
He's family and we
don't know where he is.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.143
I just think maybe...

06:25.627 --> 06:28.464
Viktor doesn't want to see us
'cos we're not family, are we?

06:28.489 --> 06:30.135
Stephen, why do you say that?

06:30.870 --> 06:32.167
Why do you keep saying that?

06:32.192 --> 06:33.629
What? There wasn't
actually a wedding.

06:33.653 --> 06:36.510
- Technically, we're not related.
- Well, you're not married to Elaine.

06:37.033 --> 06:38.197
Should we ask her to leave?

06:38.917 --> 06:43.594
The point is we need to keep
paying that lawyer to find Viktor

06:43.595 --> 06:45.237
and that's going to cost.

06:46.431 --> 06:48.728
Why do you think
I'm selling the house?

06:48.753 --> 06:51.479
I'm trying. I give you as
much as I can. Be fair.

06:51.504 --> 06:52.714
I'm working seven days a week.

06:52.739 --> 06:55.025
And you're working
for a right little sod.

06:55.050 --> 06:58.672
He was a swine when you were in
school and he hasn't changed a bit.

06:58.697 --> 06:59.752
Woody!

07:00.265 --> 07:02.783
Even named himself
after an erection.

07:03.431 --> 07:05.275
- Gran!
- Well, he did.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.055
He's right. He's a cock.

07:07.080 --> 07:08.330
And you two?

07:08.355 --> 07:09.824
Let's be honest, you're
never gonna make

07:09.848 --> 07:11.859
money out of that van, are you?

07:11.884 --> 07:14.245
- We're trying.
- Being zoned out of existence.

07:14.270 --> 07:16.065
- Yeah.
- They've closed all the food banks,

07:16.090 --> 07:17.120
have you seen?

07:17.339 --> 07:20.300
People have stopped
donating. I mean, that's the end.

07:20.421 --> 07:22.456
It's been tough this century.

07:23.085 --> 07:25.097
Tougher than I ever thought.

07:26.285 --> 07:32.064
Signor, how many days have
passed since 31st December 1999?

07:32.089 --> 07:34.487
<i>10,636.</i>

07:34.512 --> 07:36.425
10,000 days.

07:36.450 --> 07:37.933
It's a blink of an eye.

07:38.273 --> 07:42.144
10,000 days ago, I
was here, in this house.

07:43.523 --> 07:45.261
Your mother was in the kitchen,

07:45.520 --> 07:48.448
and I thought, "There
we are, we've done it."

07:48.586 --> 07:50.401
Nice little world.

07:52.120 --> 07:54.783
Well done, the
West, we've made it.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.378
We've survived.

07:57.167 --> 07:58.455
What an idiot.

07:59.365 --> 08:01.916
What a stupid,
little idiot I was.

08:02.436 --> 08:08.267
But I didn't see all the clowns
and monsters heading our way,

08:08.292 --> 08:10.869
tumbling over
each other, grinning.

08:11.822 --> 08:14.064
Dear God, what a carnival.

08:14.865 --> 08:18.685
And that's all it
took, 10,000 days.

08:19.311 --> 08:20.873
More wine.

08:21.974 --> 08:23.895
But it proves my point.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.459
We all need money.

08:27.233 --> 08:29.245
The house is going up for sale.

08:29.354 --> 08:31.645
I'll get myself a
nice little place

08:31.670 --> 08:34.982
and you can divide the
rest between the four of you.

08:38.342 --> 08:40.178
Gran, there's only
three of us now.

08:40.288 --> 08:42.092
There's no Daniel. Remember?

08:42.116 --> 08:43.620
He's gone. Danny's gone.

08:43.793 --> 08:44.966
Yes, I know.

08:45.562 --> 08:47.795
And I mean the four of you.

08:55.115 --> 08:56.990
And I won't get that much.

08:57.779 --> 09:00.185
God knows, we're
still in a slump.

09:00.210 --> 09:02.891
But this house has been
losing money for decades.

09:02.916 --> 09:03.928
It's a relic.

09:05.208 --> 09:09.224
So, this particular relic
is saying, "Let's move on."

09:09.474 --> 09:12.522
- Well, it's very kind of you.
- Yes, it is.

09:12.778 --> 09:15.677
Perhaps, but it still
doesn't alter the fact

09:15.702 --> 09:18.481
that it's all your fault.

09:19.097 --> 09:20.767
- What is?
- Everything.

09:20.792 --> 09:21.792
Who?

09:21.817 --> 09:23.823
- All of you.
- What do you mean?

09:23.848 --> 09:27.246
The banks, the
government, the recession,

09:27.348 --> 09:30.082
America, Mrs Rook.

09:30.314 --> 09:33.442
Every single thing
that's gone wrong,

09:33.467 --> 09:35.254
it's your fault.

09:35.545 --> 09:37.317
What did I do?
Where's this come from?

09:37.342 --> 09:38.608
God knows I get
blamed for an awful lot,

09:38.632 --> 09:40.619
but how am I responsible
for the entire world?

09:40.620 --> 09:43.599
Because we are,
every single one of us.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.599
We can sit here all day,
blaming other people.

09:46.600 --> 09:49.599
We blame the economy,
we blame Europe,

09:49.949 --> 09:52.530
the opposition, the weather.

09:52.972 --> 09:56.775
And then we blame these
vast, sweeping tides of history,

09:56.809 --> 09:59.340
you know, like they're
out of our control, like we're

09:59.365 --> 10:02.373
so helpless and
little and small...

10:02.592 --> 10:05.059
but it's still our fault.

10:05.385 --> 10:06.589
You know why?

10:06.706 --> 10:08.656
It's that Â£1 T-shirt.

10:08.681 --> 10:11.000
A T-shirt that cost Â£1.

10:11.025 --> 10:12.618
We can't resist it.

10:12.619 --> 10:14.134
Every single one of us.

10:14.363 --> 10:17.070
We see a T-shirt that
costs Â£1 and we think,

10:17.095 --> 10:20.228
"Ooh, that's a bargain, I'll
have that," and we buy it.

10:20.814 --> 10:22.602
Not for best, heaven forfend,

10:22.829 --> 10:27.571
but nice, little T-shirt for the
winter to go underneath, that'll do.

10:28.286 --> 10:33.415
And the shop keeper gets five
miserable pence for that T-shirt,

10:33.440 --> 10:39.385
and some little peasant in a
field gets paid 0.01 pence...

10:39.525 --> 10:41.331
and we think that's fine.

10:41.356 --> 10:42.362
All of us,

10:42.387 --> 10:47.799
and we hand over our quid and
we buy into that system for life.

10:48.104 --> 10:52.284
I saw it all going wrong when
it began in the supermarkets,

10:52.309 --> 10:54.759
when they replaced
all the women on the till

10:54.784 --> 10:57.191
with those automated checkouts.

10:57.216 --> 10:59.579
No, that's not our fault. I hate
those things, I always have.

10:59.603 --> 11:01.020
- I can't stand them.
- They drive me mad.

11:01.044 --> 11:03.433
Yes, but you didn't
do anything, did you?

11:03.458 --> 11:06.570
20 years ago, when they first
popped up, did you walk out?

11:06.595 --> 11:08.614
Did you write
letters of complaint?

11:08.615 --> 11:11.018
Did you shop elsewhere? No!

11:11.043 --> 11:14.042
You huffed and you
puffed and you put up with it.

11:14.067 --> 11:19.330
And, now, all those women
are gone and we let it happen.

11:19.355 --> 11:20.363
No, but we're still...

11:20.388 --> 11:23.573
And I think we do like
them, those checkouts.

11:23.598 --> 11:24.918
We want them.

11:25.618 --> 11:28.191
Because it means
we can stroll through,

11:28.216 --> 11:29.722
pick up our shopping,

11:29.747 --> 11:32.924
and we don't have to
look that woman in the eye.

11:32.949 --> 11:35.136
The woman who's
paid less than us.

11:35.161 --> 11:36.986
She's gone. We got rid of her.

11:37.011 --> 11:38.019
Sacked.

11:38.484 --> 11:39.504
Well done.

11:39.723 --> 11:41.894
So, yes, it's our fault.

11:42.519 --> 11:45.261
This is the world we built.

11:46.597 --> 11:48.041
Congratulations.

11:48.066 --> 11:49.199
Cheers, all.

11:56.734 --> 11:57.972
Dial Edith.

12:00.634 --> 12:02.925
Did you hear what your
daughter said to me?

12:03.230 --> 12:04.242
It's my fault.

12:04.267 --> 12:05.957
What do you mean?
Are you all right?

12:06.186 --> 12:08.316
We're just leaving. We're
outside. Where are you?

12:09.421 --> 12:11.437
It's Viktor. I know where he is.

12:11.602 --> 12:13.519
They took him to
one of the camps.

12:13.544 --> 12:15.778
Wait, hold on. How do you know?

12:15.949 --> 12:16.949
<i>It was Dad.</i>

12:17.299 --> 12:19.213
It was him. He's
the one who did it.

12:19.238 --> 12:22.526
The company that Dad works
for, they manage the Erstwhile sites.

12:22.731 --> 12:25.238
No, no, no. But I asked him.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.353
<i>He said no.</i>

12:26.386 --> 12:28.592
He was lying. I saw him online.

12:28.617 --> 12:29.814
He got Viktor transferred.

12:29.839 --> 12:31.600
<i>He did it on purpose.
He sent him there.</i>

12:31.625 --> 12:33.616
<i>No, don't, don't,
don't! I broke the law.</i>

12:33.617 --> 12:35.616
<i>They'd strip me.
They'd take it away.</i>

12:35.617 --> 12:36.671
I'd be nothing.

12:37.096 --> 12:39.124
He's my father. You
can't tell him I was there.

12:39.593 --> 12:40.605
Please, don't.

12:41.984 --> 12:44.006
But he sent Viktor
to Erstwhile 4,

12:44.031 --> 12:45.742
and that's where
they send the infected.

12:46.323 --> 12:49.315
We haven't got all day.
Keep going. Get off the truck.

12:55.682 --> 12:59.288
<i>Can all new residents
report to Security Area B.</i>

13:20.161 --> 13:22.350
- Oh, my God. Debo.
- Viktor.

13:22.595 --> 13:23.595
No, no, no!

13:23.909 --> 13:24.917
Don't come close.

13:25.022 --> 13:26.692
Stay there. Have
you got the sickness?

13:26.717 --> 13:28.147
Have you got a cough or a cold?

13:28.172 --> 13:29.252
Have you got a temperature?

13:29.286 --> 13:30.833
I'm fine. Look at me.

13:30.858 --> 13:32.420
Really, though,
we've got kids in here.

13:32.608 --> 13:33.895
We can't risk an infection.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.123
Swear to me you're not sick.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.834
On my father's life, I'm clean.

13:39.286 --> 13:40.467
It's been years.

13:41.084 --> 13:43.131
Three Bridges, long time.

13:44.889 --> 13:46.131
I saw old Josef.

13:46.156 --> 13:47.592
He said he saw you here.

13:47.927 --> 13:49.405
Oh, I've got something, Viktor.

13:49.725 --> 13:50.834
I smuggled it in.

13:52.490 --> 13:53.737
It's a ten-year battery.

13:53.991 --> 13:55.045
It still works.

13:55.365 --> 13:56.944
We can get a message out.

14:00.905 --> 14:02.991
Everybody smuggles in a phone.

14:03.326 --> 14:04.636
They think it's so clever.

14:05.350 --> 14:06.604
But we can't get a signal.

14:07.045 --> 14:08.084
We're blocked.

14:08.109 --> 14:09.756
No 6G, nothing.

14:10.436 --> 14:11.483
You see?

14:12.095 --> 14:14.842
That's like a Blink signal,
but on a massive scale.

14:15.764 --> 14:18.069
They've got a transmitter up
there covering the whole site

14:18.094 --> 14:19.694
with a 2km circumference.

14:20.314 --> 14:23.919
It stops all phone lines,
Wi-Fi, mercury links.

14:24.558 --> 14:25.598
We're offline.

14:26.154 --> 14:27.571
Permanently.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.223
So, they seal us off and
then they bring in the infection

14:33.248 --> 14:34.284
and let it spread.

14:36.619 --> 14:38.419
I think it's very British.

14:38.894 --> 14:40.606
Killing with influenza.

14:40.763 --> 14:41.888
So...

14:42.407 --> 14:43.415
what do we do?

14:43.440 --> 14:46.966
Even if we could phone, we
don't learn numbers any more.

14:48.062 --> 14:50.513
I wouldn't know how
to call them, my family.

14:51.568 --> 14:53.372
Your family reported
you to the police.

14:53.397 --> 14:54.429
No, not Ukraine.

14:54.950 --> 14:56.302
I have a family here now.

14:56.935 --> 14:58.365
Remember we first met?

14:58.599 --> 14:59.833
I told you about him.

15:00.575 --> 15:01.579
Daniel.

15:02.603 --> 15:03.880
Can't he get you out?

15:04.595 --> 15:05.794
He would if he could.

15:06.822 --> 15:08.442
He'd try anything.

15:11.147 --> 15:13.602
But his family, they'll
be looking for me.

15:13.958 --> 15:17.146
All I'm saying is, if you could
take my side, just for once.

15:17.435 --> 15:19.193
It's not about sides.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.958
Oh, so what happens when I
say, "Let's go see my family"?

15:21.983 --> 15:23.497
No, all of a sudden,
you're too busy.

15:24.036 --> 15:26.021
You're working all
hours, I get that, okay?

15:26.046 --> 15:28.028
And he's a bastard to
work for, I get that, too.

15:28.053 --> 15:29.909
But you volunteer, Stephen.

15:29.934 --> 15:32.403
You volunteer for more work.

15:32.770 --> 15:35.597
You could be here with me, but I
think you choose to come home late.

15:35.598 --> 15:38.387
- I'm trying!
- Every time you save more than 20 quid,

15:38.412 --> 15:40.082
it goes straight to
your bloody family!

15:40.107 --> 15:43.091
I try and save, all I want
is somewhere nice to live

15:43.116 --> 15:44.708
and you just don't care!

16:07.801 --> 16:08.805
Steve, yeah?

16:09.610 --> 16:10.833
Yeah, hi.

16:12.969 --> 16:13.973
Transfer.

16:19.767 --> 16:20.771
Cheers, mate.

16:22.370 --> 16:23.669
Is that the proper case?

16:24.177 --> 16:25.422
I said so, didn't I?

16:25.447 --> 16:27.794
Well, I need to get it
through a metal detector.

16:27.819 --> 16:29.169
Better trust me, then.

16:58.173 --> 16:59.221
All clear.

17:29.090 --> 17:31.004
I almost feel sorry for Elaine.

17:31.871 --> 17:33.363
I should take her
out for a drink.

17:33.762 --> 17:35.332
You walked out
on the both of us.

17:35.357 --> 17:36.723
We could have a
good old chat, I bet.

17:36.747 --> 17:38.089
No, sorry, but...

17:38.114 --> 17:40.885
I left Elaine but I
didn't exactly leave you.

17:41.267 --> 17:43.636
As I remember it,
you threw me out.

17:44.924 --> 17:46.440
Cor, what a night that was.

17:47.956 --> 17:49.089
Long time ago.

17:49.592 --> 17:51.612
Yeah. Years, now.

17:53.814 --> 17:55.213
Just before Danny.

17:56.192 --> 17:57.392
So, guess what happened to me?

17:57.892 --> 17:59.355
Same old story.

18:00.188 --> 18:03.987
The Academy found software
costing Â£200 which replaces me, for life.

18:04.012 --> 18:06.830
So, there's no such thing
as an accountant any more.

18:06.855 --> 18:08.917
We've joined that list of
jobs that no longer exist,

18:08.942 --> 18:11.230
along with travel
agents and referees.

18:12.130 --> 18:14.138
So, I was wondering...

18:14.333 --> 18:16.016
is there any chance
of work at yours?

18:18.458 --> 18:19.602
Oh. Erm...

18:20.571 --> 18:23.555
Well, it's a bit specialist.

18:23.580 --> 18:25.007
A lot of our stuff
is ring-fenced.

18:25.032 --> 18:26.032
I'll do anything.

18:26.270 --> 18:27.938
Stephen, I'll mop the floors.

18:27.963 --> 18:29.782
- Don't say that.
- But I will.

18:30.556 --> 18:31.868
I need work.

18:34.743 --> 18:35.999
Oh, I don't know.

18:36.024 --> 18:37.751
Woody's in charge,
not me, and...

18:38.700 --> 18:40.215
well, he's a bastard, but...

18:41.808 --> 18:42.964
there might be something.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.026
Honestly, anything.

18:46.696 --> 18:47.839
It could be nice.

18:48.800 --> 18:51.050
We could do this more
often, the two of us.

18:53.367 --> 18:55.607
We used to go to a lot better
places than this, remember?

18:55.806 --> 18:56.806
Yeah.

18:59.074 --> 19:01.222
I don't miss that,
though, not really.

19:03.982 --> 19:05.198
I miss you.

19:10.011 --> 19:11.269
I suppose...

19:12.356 --> 19:14.722
We cover a lot of
inner-city housing,

19:15.034 --> 19:16.915
we're always having
problems with benefits

19:16.940 --> 19:19.410
'cos what's the one place that
still hasn't got the right software?

19:19.434 --> 19:20.438
The NHS.

19:22.269 --> 19:24.509
- So, there's a lot of chasing claims.
- I could do that.

19:24.847 --> 19:26.269
It's pretty menial stuff.

19:26.294 --> 19:27.322
I don't care.

19:27.438 --> 19:30.417
Ruby's starting that course,
Bethany's got upgrades every month.

19:31.330 --> 19:32.544
We need the money.

19:33.033 --> 19:35.034
I'm sorry to have
to ask like this, but...

19:35.425 --> 19:36.425
could you try?

19:37.102 --> 19:38.142
Seriously?

19:40.273 --> 19:41.479
Of course I will.

19:43.129 --> 19:44.378
I'd do anything for you.

19:47.783 --> 19:49.244
It worked. I got him.

19:49.277 --> 19:50.541
He did exactly what I said.

19:51.174 --> 19:53.182
- I'm in.
- I bet he loved it.

19:53.768 --> 19:55.860
Thinks he's winning
you back. Bastard.

19:55.885 --> 19:57.768
No, don't do that.

19:58.072 --> 20:00.166
I told you, I'm not doing
this to get your brother,

20:00.191 --> 20:01.330
I'm doing it to save him.

20:01.355 --> 20:02.657
If you can get Viktor out, fine,

20:02.682 --> 20:05.025
you can do whatever you
want with these Erstwhile camps.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.565
Just don't involve me.

20:06.590 --> 20:08.064
I'm not part of that, okay?

20:08.257 --> 20:09.330
My sister's in there.

20:09.355 --> 20:11.299
So, all you have to
do is get out of my way.

20:11.868 --> 20:13.369
Well, I need a couple of days.

20:14.371 --> 20:16.307
If you can teach
me their systems,

20:16.650 --> 20:19.385
then I can get in there and remove
your dad's name from the evidence.

20:19.410 --> 20:21.418
Sis, you have to do
what you have to do.

20:24.050 --> 20:26.789
For all we know, he's
already sent Viktor to his death.

20:26.814 --> 20:28.619
But if he's alive, we
need to get him out.

20:28.644 --> 20:29.719
For Danny's sake.

20:29.744 --> 20:31.916
I don't get it.
I've met Stephen.

20:32.146 --> 20:33.682
He's nice, he's just...

20:34.374 --> 20:36.689
I'm not being rude,
but he's just ordinary.

20:37.276 --> 20:39.002
Why would he do that to Viktor?

20:39.276 --> 20:40.300
He blames him.

20:40.339 --> 20:41.354
For Daniel.

20:41.870 --> 20:43.135
That's ridiculous.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.744
No, but he really blames him.

20:46.327 --> 20:48.236
He's stuck on it profoundly.

20:48.861 --> 20:50.636
Keeps going on and on.

20:50.637 --> 20:52.940
How could he drown
wearing a life jacket?

20:52.965 --> 20:54.921
How could he actually drown?

20:58.869 --> 21:01.032
But there are these
videos. They're awful.

21:01.417 --> 21:03.421
Oh, Stephen. Don't...

21:03.446 --> 21:05.446
But I've got to. I've
got to. I've got to.

21:07.980 --> 21:08.984
I've got to.

21:12.173 --> 21:13.298
'Cos they show you.

21:14.705 --> 21:16.040
You float, but...

21:16.743 --> 21:18.557
you swallow a little
bit of sea water.

21:19.409 --> 21:21.495
And a tiny bit of that
gets into your lungs.

21:22.812 --> 21:24.963
And, then, it happens
again. Then, it happens again.

21:26.605 --> 21:28.874
And, then, there's a wave
and you swallow some more.

21:30.053 --> 21:31.093
So...

21:32.447 --> 21:34.399
it's not fast, it's not quick.

21:36.597 --> 21:38.303
You hope these things
are peaceful, but...

21:39.400 --> 21:40.436
they're not.

21:43.765 --> 21:46.132
He drowned
really, really slowly.

21:47.499 --> 21:49.710
'Cos he's that
man, isn't he? Hm?

21:50.347 --> 21:53.538
You know, that nice man,
walking around, suit and tie,

21:53.999 --> 21:55.869
everything's fine.

21:57.815 --> 22:00.088
But, underneath,
it's killing him.

22:01.024 --> 22:02.028
Okay.

22:04.389 --> 22:07.591
But if you can get
online with all your tech,

22:07.838 --> 22:10.127
can't you help Viktor
right here and now?

22:10.152 --> 22:11.916
All I can do is
read their files.

22:12.434 --> 22:14.307
Dad's company works
on a quantum network.

22:14.332 --> 22:16.388
The whole thing is
completely encrypted.

22:16.939 --> 22:19.413
It means she can't touch
anything without being seen.

22:19.799 --> 22:21.424
- I could try and...
- No.

22:21.830 --> 22:23.400
Absolutely not.

22:23.887 --> 22:26.424
'Cos your technology is
owned by the government.

22:26.729 --> 22:28.025
And if they can trace it...

22:28.736 --> 22:30.868
You've seen what they can do.

22:30.893 --> 22:32.135
They disappear people.

22:32.160 --> 22:34.216
But you are not
taking that risk.

22:34.241 --> 22:35.245
Never.

22:36.384 --> 22:39.424
I'm going inside as
staff, God help me.

22:40.095 --> 22:42.766
I'm going to clean up
Stephen's name and get out.

22:42.791 --> 22:46.141
Thing is, if a bunch of landlords
are on a quantum network,

22:46.166 --> 22:49.213
that's Home Office security.

22:49.588 --> 22:52.766
So, this thing goes all the
way back to Vivienne Rook.

22:52.791 --> 22:55.955
And, if we can get inside,
we can make it public.

22:56.424 --> 22:57.914
Yeah, but how do you do that?

22:57.939 --> 22:59.851
Stories about the camps
go online one second,

22:59.876 --> 23:01.353
next second, they're gone.

23:01.587 --> 23:03.345
Four Star Party scrubs it clean.

23:03.642 --> 23:04.978
That why we've got Ahmed.

23:05.179 --> 23:06.681
Give me the date and I'm in.

23:07.743 --> 23:09.282
And, to do that, we need you.

23:09.586 --> 23:11.259
Oh, right. Good. Yeah.

23:11.284 --> 23:12.296
Happy to help.

23:12.575 --> 23:13.884
Whatever it is, absolutely.

23:15.453 --> 23:16.821
It's not dangerous, is it?

23:17.868 --> 23:20.590
I'm not supposed to do this
officially, but I know for a fact

23:20.591 --> 23:23.384
you're being moved to a different
site and I need you to do this.

23:23.587 --> 23:26.415
When you get there, find
a man called Viktor Goraya.

23:26.632 --> 23:27.821
This is for him.

23:28.449 --> 23:30.774
Get it to Viktor Goraya, okay?

23:37.586 --> 23:39.602
Don't touch me and
get through that gate!

23:39.627 --> 23:40.665
Come on.

23:43.062 --> 23:44.062
On your way!

23:44.087 --> 23:46.313
Turns out that we've
got the same solicitor,

23:46.338 --> 23:47.610
Yvonne Bukhari.

23:53.634 --> 23:55.228
The good news is it's working.

23:55.720 --> 23:58.470
They're talking about more
Erstwhile sites right across the North,

23:58.495 --> 23:59.884
which suits me fine.

24:00.430 --> 24:01.829
Remember that McAllister bloke?

24:02.356 --> 24:04.656
He bollocksed it. Lost
the contract, the tosser.

24:05.214 --> 24:06.391
More work for us.

24:06.992 --> 24:08.632
- I'd better get back to it, then.
- Yeah.

24:10.610 --> 24:12.891
Oh, I was going to say.
Nice work on recruitment.

24:13.132 --> 24:14.774
That for me birthday,
or can I have her now?

24:14.798 --> 24:15.805
Very funny.

24:15.984 --> 24:19.780
Her surname's still Bisme-Lyons,
but you got divorced, didn't you?

24:19.805 --> 24:21.593
So, why's she
call herself Lyons?

24:21.789 --> 24:23.952
- That's yours. She stole it, mate.
- She likes it.

24:23.977 --> 24:26.437
- It's the surname of our children.
- Takes your name?

24:26.586 --> 24:28.656
Takes your money? Bitch.

24:29.295 --> 24:31.148
So, you don't mind, then? Hm?

24:31.492 --> 24:33.328
If I have a go, if I
have a little pop?

24:33.353 --> 24:35.336
Open up her rusting back doors.

24:35.361 --> 24:37.312
Mrs Bisme-Lyons.

24:39.171 --> 24:40.195
I've really got to work.

24:40.220 --> 24:42.805
Come on, you can
tell me what she likes.

24:43.614 --> 24:45.317
Or better still,
what she doesn't.

24:48.590 --> 24:50.676
Look, he loves it, eh?

24:52.549 --> 24:53.581
Try again.

24:54.308 --> 24:55.832
Oh, sorry, was that my fault?

24:55.857 --> 24:56.871
That's okay.

24:56.896 --> 24:59.183
Sorry, I'm still new
to this quantum stuff.

24:59.208 --> 25:00.240
Give me time.

25:00.265 --> 25:01.610
No, we can't give
you any more time.

25:01.634 --> 25:03.621
I warned you. That's it.
We're going ahead tonight.

25:03.622 --> 25:05.379
I told you, we're not
waiting for anyone.

25:05.404 --> 25:07.066
But I haven't got
rid of his name yet.

25:07.091 --> 25:08.604
It's not that simple.

25:08.862 --> 25:10.190
Oh, I have to go back.

25:10.215 --> 25:13.229
Well, good luck, but
Stephen's not my priority now.

25:13.254 --> 25:14.620
We've told Viktor it's tonight.

25:14.759 --> 25:15.759
Bye.

25:15.784 --> 25:17.221
Kettle's boiled.

25:17.246 --> 25:19.315
Sorry, I won't stop for tea.

25:19.340 --> 25:20.380
It's the new job.

25:20.405 --> 25:21.846
I've got to go.

25:22.564 --> 25:24.556
What's that about Stephen?

25:24.581 --> 25:26.221
No, it's just...

25:26.601 --> 25:27.643
Oh, it's nothing.

25:31.185 --> 25:33.561
You've got an hour till anyone
clocks you're not legit, okay?

25:33.585 --> 25:36.057
- Thanks. You ready?
- Mate, I'm so ready for this.

25:38.613 --> 25:39.893
Only got one chance tonight.

25:40.603 --> 25:41.979
Hey, don't let me down.

25:45.307 --> 25:47.729
Do you know the most
stupid thing you can do?

25:48.605 --> 25:50.393
Fall in love with a Lyons.

25:50.885 --> 25:53.005
You've been getting me
into trouble ever since we met.

25:53.424 --> 25:55.428
Last time, I promise.

25:58.556 --> 25:59.831
If we get out of this alive,

25:59.856 --> 26:02.216
I'm going to start looking
after you, 'cos I'm not an idiot.

26:02.420 --> 26:03.729
I know something's wrong.

26:04.236 --> 26:05.236
Okay?

26:05.924 --> 26:06.924
Yeah.

26:14.616 --> 26:16.607
Look, okay, I'm being
completely honest.

26:16.608 --> 26:19.314
I bought it for 20,000,
but then I refurbished it.

26:19.339 --> 26:20.571
I retooled the whole thing.

26:20.596 --> 26:22.916
So, if I only want 20K
now, that's a bargain.

26:22.941 --> 26:24.883
Big Jim says 10K, maximum.

26:24.908 --> 26:27.478
Well, tell Big Jim he can
sod off. That's not a fair price.

26:27.503 --> 26:29.861
He said you can't get
a licence to sell food.

26:30.036 --> 26:31.283
You can't get the zones.

26:31.463 --> 26:33.555
No, a little bit of
red tape, that's all.

26:33.580 --> 26:34.869
Anyway, where is Big Jim?

26:34.894 --> 26:36.555
Ah, it's Thursday
night. He dines out.

26:36.580 --> 26:38.603
Oh, does he? Very nice.

26:38.604 --> 26:40.127
Even bigger Jim.

26:41.439 --> 26:43.968
But I'm stuck, 'cos Jonjo's
got a job with this courier firm,

26:43.993 --> 26:46.754
so he's in Crewe half the week
and he's the only one who can drive it.

26:46.845 --> 26:48.704
I can't 'cos my legs
don't reach, do you see?

26:48.945 --> 26:51.580
So, it's useless
to me, and... Oh.

26:54.227 --> 26:55.624
Hiya, darling. I'm a bit busy.

26:56.271 --> 26:57.391
They did what?

27:00.001 --> 27:01.735
- Oi!
- Sorry, emergency.

27:02.399 --> 27:04.055
I'm authorised to go to 11!

27:14.164 --> 27:15.168
Where do we go?

27:15.193 --> 27:16.672
I'm new, not done
this site before.

27:16.961 --> 27:18.383
Head straight up to the kitchen.

27:18.408 --> 27:20.156
- Green double doors.
- Thanks.

28:04.029 --> 28:05.109
Bins, mate.

28:10.222 --> 28:11.304
Here you go, boys.

28:11.595 --> 28:13.787
I'd like to be a
refugee, eating all this.

28:13.812 --> 28:14.858
You're kidding.

28:14.883 --> 28:16.336
This is for us, not them.

28:16.653 --> 28:18.023
They get the scraps.

28:52.897 --> 28:54.547
- It's not right, this, mate.
- What's going on?

28:54.571 --> 28:56.579
You try and tell 'em,
Rosie. They've locked gates!

28:56.819 --> 28:58.958
That's her son over there, Lee.

28:58.983 --> 29:00.335
The gates don't close till ten!

29:00.360 --> 29:03.132
Tough. There's been a
shooting at the Farmer's Arms.

29:03.157 --> 29:05.129
The rules say we
lock up immediately.

29:05.154 --> 29:06.569
How long for? Till when?

29:06.594 --> 29:09.350
- You know the rules: 6am.
- Staying locked all night?

29:09.375 --> 29:11.218
He's 12 years old.
My lad's 12 years old!

29:11.243 --> 29:12.577
You can't keep
him out overnight!

29:12.602 --> 29:15.021
That'll teach him for nicking
our stuff then, won't it?

29:15.046 --> 29:16.077
We know it's him.

29:16.102 --> 29:17.786
But you can't do that! Can they?

29:17.811 --> 29:19.621
- Are we going to let 'em?
- No!

29:19.622 --> 29:21.952
- You see, open the gates.
- Yeah, well,

29:21.977 --> 29:23.288
how are you going to make me?

29:23.313 --> 29:24.982
We'll bloody tear
the fence down.

29:25.007 --> 29:26.007
Go on, then.

29:26.032 --> 29:27.068
Let's see it.

29:30.595 --> 29:32.716
- Bastard.
- That's me name, love.

29:35.593 --> 29:36.780
What are we going to do?

29:36.834 --> 29:38.887
Speak to Gillian. She's
the other side of the fence.

29:38.912 --> 29:40.335
She'll have to take
him in overnight.

29:40.359 --> 29:43.021
But Jonjo's in Crewe. He's on a
job. What am I supposed to do?

29:44.201 --> 29:46.287
Gill, hiya, love. Can
you do us a favour?

29:55.068 --> 29:56.584
While you're down there, love...

30:08.338 --> 30:10.517
<i>Phone call. Rosie Lyons.</i>

30:10.542 --> 30:12.029
Oh, well, yes.

30:12.054 --> 30:13.809
- <i>Gran.</i>
- Hello, there.

30:13.834 --> 30:16.240
I just wanted to let you
know that that thing you said,

30:16.265 --> 30:17.826
about everything
being our fault.

30:17.881 --> 30:20.177
What about it? You okay?

30:20.545 --> 30:21.584
Yeah, I'm fine.

30:22.593 --> 30:24.256
Just phoning to
say that you're right.

30:25.287 --> 30:28.654
What happens next
is absolutely my fault.

30:29.552 --> 30:30.612
Thank you.

30:33.122 --> 30:34.926
That's your lot.
Don't eat it all at once.

30:34.959 --> 30:36.309
- Cheers, lads.
- Thanks for that.

30:44.966 --> 30:47.446
There's no sign of him. We
don't even know if he's still alive.

30:47.554 --> 30:49.395
What do we do? We can't stay?

30:49.966 --> 30:51.450
I don't know, just drive.

31:03.087 --> 31:04.111
There he is!

31:06.134 --> 31:08.466
- Come on! Come on! Come on!
- Oh, my God! You did it!

31:08.934 --> 31:11.137
- Are you in?
- That's it. Go, go, go!

31:11.162 --> 31:12.653
- Hey! Hey!
- Go, go, go!

31:12.678 --> 31:15.051
Somebody stop them! Oi!

31:25.216 --> 31:27.809
Oi! Stop! Get out of the truck.

31:31.485 --> 31:32.485
Stop!

31:59.432 --> 32:00.529
Out you get.

32:01.592 --> 32:03.499
Come on. Come on.

32:03.827 --> 32:05.467
You ain't going to
get very far, are you?

32:05.492 --> 32:06.547
We're filming you.

32:06.733 --> 32:08.849
All of this. We're recording it.

32:08.874 --> 32:10.139
The signals don't work.

32:10.387 --> 32:11.903
Every second of this, mate.

32:11.928 --> 32:13.178
I've got your face.

32:13.203 --> 32:14.645
Every single one of you.

32:14.670 --> 32:16.202
We know what goes on in here!

32:16.227 --> 32:19.022
Yeah, make your nice little
film, then. Good luck getting it out.

32:19.623 --> 32:21.420
- Take a shot.
- What are they doing?

32:21.445 --> 32:23.139
- We should surrender.
- No way.

32:23.164 --> 32:25.959
- Giving out orders.
- Edith, there's a story.

32:26.292 --> 32:28.570
The site in the north,
three men stole a truck.

32:28.595 --> 32:29.887
They tried to break out.

32:29.912 --> 32:31.553
They shot them.
They killed them.

32:31.835 --> 32:32.835
No-one cares.

32:32.860 --> 32:34.100
They're going to shoot us dead!

32:35.937 --> 32:37.001
What the hell?

32:37.826 --> 32:41.240
Rosie! I didn't know
you could drive this thing.

32:41.860 --> 32:44.068
I need legs. I've got legs.

32:44.896 --> 32:46.513
Now, get that lot out me way.

32:47.468 --> 32:49.553
- Left foot clutch.
- Got it.

32:49.578 --> 32:51.793
Get back! Get out of the road!

32:51.818 --> 32:54.091
- You remember your Uncle Danny?
- Yeah.

32:55.163 --> 32:56.552
He crossed an ocean.

32:57.630 --> 32:59.083
You wouldn't dare!

32:59.174 --> 33:00.615
I'm sorry I brought
you into this.

33:01.205 --> 33:04.581
Thing is, Viktor, as
much as I love you,

33:04.606 --> 33:06.099
you're not that important.

33:07.141 --> 33:08.349
What do you mean?

33:08.983 --> 33:10.865
We didn't just come
here to save you.

33:11.598 --> 33:14.044
We came here to start a war.

33:25.076 --> 33:26.266
She's all yours.

33:44.995 --> 33:45.995
Yes!

33:49.700 --> 33:51.252
Come on! Come on!

34:02.449 --> 34:03.606
Have we got a signal?

34:03.631 --> 34:05.059
Okay, okay.

34:06.306 --> 34:07.950
Move it! Move it!

34:07.975 --> 34:09.239
Move that van.

34:10.784 --> 34:11.809
Folks...

34:12.331 --> 34:13.608
a ten-year battery!

34:13.609 --> 34:14.621
It still works.

34:14.646 --> 34:16.766
Everyone, quickly, take a
phone, take a phone quickly.

34:17.228 --> 34:18.254
Take a phone.

34:18.279 --> 34:19.973
Quickly, everyone, grab a phone!

34:26.357 --> 34:28.552
Go on, then! Arrest
me. On camera.

34:28.577 --> 34:31.284
A woman and her two little
kids! You're going to look pathetic.

34:40.141 --> 34:41.270
Get your phones out.

34:41.295 --> 34:43.465
Get them out. Get
the phones out!

34:44.398 --> 34:47.253
Keep filming. Keep filming.

34:47.277 --> 34:50.277
Keep filming, all
of you, every one.

34:50.303 --> 34:52.683
They can't block
the signal any more.

34:52.708 --> 34:53.909
You can be seen.

34:54.318 --> 34:56.306
They can't block
the signal any more.

34:56.768 --> 34:58.238
You can be seen.

34:58.395 --> 35:01.986
This is a record of
Erstwhile Camp 4,

35:02.011 --> 35:05.550
run by Vivienne Rook
and the British Government.

35:05.675 --> 35:07.339
Do you think anyone cares,

35:07.364 --> 35:09.830
about this lot?
Who's watching you?

35:09.855 --> 35:11.300
Everyone.

35:11.325 --> 35:12.417
Everyone.

35:12.442 --> 35:14.191
<i>Every single house.</i>

35:14.996 --> 35:15.996
Send.

35:16.823 --> 35:20.791
<i>Keep your phones on. The
whole country can see it.</i>

35:20.824 --> 35:22.547
<i>The whole world.</i>

35:22.548 --> 35:24.552
<i>Another goal and it's in!</i>

35:25.637 --> 35:27.802
<i>Keep filming.
Don't stop filming!</i>

35:28.438 --> 35:29.801
Turn it back over!

35:30.942 --> 35:34.458
<i>This is a record of
Erstwhile Camp 4!</i>

35:34.483 --> 35:38.934
<i>All these people are
refugees and asylum seekers,</i>

35:38.959 --> 35:42.761
<i>kept here with no
rights, no health care,</i>

35:42.786 --> 35:45.091
- <i>and they've been left here to die.</i>
- Send.

35:45.387 --> 35:48.153
<i>These guards are your
sons and daughters,</i>

35:48.178 --> 35:49.778
- <i>your brothers and sisters...</i>
- Oh, yes!

35:49.852 --> 35:51.868
<i>Your friends. They work here.</i>

35:51.893 --> 35:54.599
<i>They imprisoned us. They
let us die! Look at them!</i>

35:56.559 --> 35:59.535
- <i>Look at their faces! Remember them!</i>
- Viktor! Oh, my God!

36:01.676 --> 36:03.598
This site is a death camp.

36:03.599 --> 36:07.610
<i>The Four Star Party
funded these sites</i>

36:07.611 --> 36:10.629
<i>and profited from
their construction.</i>

36:10.654 --> 36:12.254
Vivienne Rook did this!

36:12.279 --> 36:13.994
A policy of murder!

36:14.019 --> 36:15.894
What the hell is going on?

36:15.919 --> 36:17.466
Bethany? What are you doing?

36:17.490 --> 36:19.066
You don't own us any more.

36:19.442 --> 36:20.737
We're declaring independence.

36:20.762 --> 36:23.230
- Oh, my God! Rosie.
- <i>They've no idea about that.</i>

36:23.255 --> 36:25.144
<i>They lock us in
and fence us off.</i>

36:25.973 --> 36:27.893
<i>Well, not any more.
Are you with me?</i>

36:27.918 --> 36:32.073
Yeah! Rosie! Rosie! Rosie!

36:32.098 --> 36:33.215
<i>They let us die.</i>

36:33.240 --> 36:35.496
- <i>They come in and fence us off.</i>
- Oh, my God. No way!

36:38.098 --> 36:39.804
<i>- Vivienne Rook...
- Lock us in.</i>

36:39.829 --> 36:41.386
It's on every channel.

36:41.824 --> 36:43.591
Good girls!

36:44.634 --> 36:47.744
<i>This is a record of
Erstwhile Camp 4...</i>

36:47.769 --> 36:51.426
<i>run by Vivienne Rook

36:51.451 --> 36:53.459

36:59.840 --> 37:01.081
Is that your sister?

37:01.885 --> 37:03.706
Is that your fucking sister?

37:04.276 --> 37:05.476
Did you set me up?

37:05.501 --> 37:07.956
I didn't know, I swear. But
they found the Erstwhile sites.

37:07.981 --> 37:09.581
I know! It's everywhere!

37:09.902 --> 37:11.854
<i>I'm here. I'm at the
offices right now.</i>

37:11.879 --> 37:12.879
I can fix this.

37:24.957 --> 37:26.268
Right. So...

37:28.371 --> 37:30.440
Of course. I should
have realised.

37:33.729 --> 37:34.729
You know, don't you?

37:36.325 --> 37:37.479
Who was it? Edith?

37:38.554 --> 37:40.137
- I was just working late.
- Do the girls know?

37:40.161 --> 37:42.767
I just had a bit of work and
this quantum network's new

37:42.792 --> 37:44.800
so I... I thought I'd
do a bit extra time...

37:44.825 --> 37:45.825
Celeste!

37:49.296 --> 37:52.401
Stephen, I'm trying to help you.

37:52.426 --> 37:53.534
Oh, fuck.

37:55.268 --> 37:58.307
No! I can take your
name off the documents.

37:58.340 --> 38:01.544
Or I thought I
could, but I can't.

38:01.569 --> 38:04.088
I can't. No matter
how I try, I can't do it.

38:04.993 --> 38:06.079
Can you help me?

38:06.377 --> 38:07.924
We could do it together. Please.

38:08.593 --> 38:10.783
- Do what?
- Take your name off...

38:10.838 --> 38:12.471
the evidence, so
no-one will know.

38:12.609 --> 38:14.338
If we do it now,
we've still got time.

38:14.869 --> 38:17.026
- What were you trying to get into?
- There's that chain.

38:17.050 --> 38:19.205
The Lyons Erstwhile
4 with your name on it.

38:25.593 --> 38:27.150
Well, you'll never
get into that.

38:28.667 --> 38:30.260
I compiled it myself.

38:31.900 --> 38:33.096
It's got everything in it.

38:34.686 --> 38:35.751
Everything we did.

38:38.585 --> 38:41.557
- Great, big, long list.
- We can scrub it clean.

38:42.593 --> 38:44.228
Since when were
you such an expert?

38:47.514 --> 38:48.775
Oh, God, Bethany.

38:50.883 --> 38:51.923
Oh...

38:56.605 --> 38:57.605
Bethany.

39:00.193 --> 39:02.252
Bethany. You told
her, didn't you?

39:05.364 --> 39:06.634
She knows.

39:07.696 --> 39:08.993
She knows.

39:12.434 --> 39:14.434
Oh, my God. You told her.

39:17.797 --> 39:19.470
Do you know what gets me?

39:21.798 --> 39:24.157
What really, really gets me?

39:24.576 --> 39:26.556
This cost such a lot of money.

39:27.847 --> 39:29.962
It's not like I've got
cash to spare, is it?

39:30.208 --> 39:32.266
I'm the man who
lost a million quid.

39:34.352 --> 39:35.687
I had to buy this.

39:37.641 --> 39:38.923
Oh, Jesus.

39:42.181 --> 39:45.173
You can scrub that file all
you like, but you'd still know.

39:49.949 --> 39:51.953
I sent people to their deaths.

39:53.614 --> 39:56.586
And you knew all this time.

39:58.965 --> 40:02.165
Did we sit and have
coffee and Sunday lunch?

40:05.204 --> 40:06.782
All those things I told you.

40:09.113 --> 40:10.750
Oh, my God. You were playing me.

40:21.703 --> 40:25.250
Stephen, please don't.

40:25.765 --> 40:26.773
Don't what?

40:27.227 --> 40:28.445
Hurt me.

40:29.074 --> 40:31.344
- What?
- Please don't hurt me.

40:32.851 --> 40:34.445
- What?
- Please.

40:34.804 --> 40:36.211
I don't... What are you saying?

40:36.236 --> 40:37.914
Please don't hurt me.

40:38.138 --> 40:39.476
Think of the girls.

40:40.481 --> 40:41.656
Oh, my God.

40:47.836 --> 40:50.562
This isn't for you. Oh, my God.

40:51.023 --> 40:52.719
Did you think this was for you?

40:54.583 --> 40:55.875
This is for me.

40:57.295 --> 40:58.295
What?

40:58.320 --> 41:02.719
I came here to send
the file to the police.

41:02.922 --> 41:04.226
That's why I made it.

41:04.828 --> 41:08.883
I always thought I'd
send it and use this.

41:10.388 --> 41:11.445
Every day.

41:11.887 --> 41:13.038
That was the plan.

41:15.656 --> 41:17.264
But I'm such a coward.

41:21.929 --> 41:22.936
Steve!

41:50.182 --> 41:51.250
No.

41:55.802 --> 41:56.858
No.

41:58.600 --> 41:59.616
I'm sorry.

42:02.370 --> 42:04.054
Put it down, sweetheart.

42:04.740 --> 42:06.589
I want you to put it down.

42:07.475 --> 42:10.944
And then you and
me, we can just sit...

42:10.969 --> 42:14.210
and I promise
we'll find a way out.

42:16.971 --> 42:18.201
That would be nice.

42:19.138 --> 42:20.537
Put it down first.

42:22.748 --> 42:24.310
I won't allow this any more.

42:24.335 --> 42:25.576
Put it down!

42:38.825 --> 42:40.451
You little fuck!

42:40.717 --> 42:41.881
Was it the two of you?

42:42.396 --> 42:45.006
Did you do this with
your little fucking bitch?

42:45.031 --> 42:46.842
Well, let me tell
you, you bastard,

42:46.867 --> 42:49.068
I am so going to fuck with you.

42:55.487 --> 42:56.771
Well, that worked.

42:58.256 --> 42:59.256
Bastard!

43:00.465 --> 43:01.513
Yeah.

43:04.307 --> 43:06.021
You'd better go. Get out.

43:06.334 --> 43:07.334
Yeah.

43:11.251 --> 43:12.896
I've got a file to send.

43:46.391 --> 43:47.455
I wonder...

43:53.430 --> 43:54.430
I wonder...

43:55.669 --> 43:56.669
What?

43:58.791 --> 44:00.286
What happens next?

44:02.739 --> 44:03.739
Edith!

44:05.847 --> 44:06.847
Edith!

44:07.684 --> 44:09.067
Viktor!

44:10.536 --> 44:11.575
Please.

44:12.294 --> 44:14.256
She just fell on the floor. I
don't know what happened.

44:14.280 --> 44:17.200
- Edith! Edith. Edith, please.
- Edith. Edith.

44:17.225 --> 44:19.512
Somebody help! Somebody help!

44:24.098 --> 44:25.659
<i>In Downing Street today,</i>

44:25.684 --> 44:28.535
<i>Vivienne Rook has become
the first British Prime Minister</i>

44:28.560 --> 44:30.176
<i>to be arrested in office.</i>

44:30.407 --> 44:33.526
<i>Astonishing scenes after
the Erstwhile scandal,</i>

44:33.551 --> 44:36.963
<i>as the New Metropolitan
Police take Vivienne Alison Rook</i>

44:36.988 --> 44:41.027
<i>into custody on charges of
murder and conspiracy to murder.</i>

44:41.332 --> 44:44.166
<i>And, today, Notre Dame
has officially reopened,</i>

44:44.191 --> 44:45.542
<i>while, at the same time,</i>

44:45.543 --> 44:48.559
<i>the Leaning Tower of
Pisa has finally fallen down.</i>

44:59.445 --> 45:02.429
Oh. There you are. Little Danny.

45:03.776 --> 45:05.761
Hold on, hold on. Go back a bit.

45:11.546 --> 45:13.332
Sorry, was I going too fast?

45:13.465 --> 45:15.972
My fault. We
started accelerating.

45:16.254 --> 45:17.551
Too much adrenaline.

45:18.918 --> 45:20.582
So, where were we?

45:21.328 --> 45:23.715
Five years ago. 2029.

45:23.988 --> 45:25.388
How you brought
down Vivienne Rook.

45:25.707 --> 45:28.152
Ah, is that what
it sounded like?

45:28.177 --> 45:29.371
It wasn't us.

45:30.062 --> 45:31.932
We did our bit, but
so did lots of people.

45:31.957 --> 45:34.152
There was a riot at the
Scottish camp on the same night.

45:34.176 --> 45:37.393
50 refugees escaped
from Erstwhile 3.

45:37.507 --> 45:39.573
Got their stories
published in Germany.

45:39.598 --> 45:42.839
Whole thing was collapsing,
we just gave it a push.

45:43.908 --> 45:45.960
All the same, not a bad result.

45:46.244 --> 45:47.244
Huh?

45:47.581 --> 45:49.993
Mrs Rook got 27 years.

45:50.018 --> 45:51.776
Yeah. Maybe.

45:52.078 --> 45:53.925
But you know what
my gran says...

45:54.818 --> 45:56.088
"Wait for the next one."

45:57.073 --> 45:58.495
Get rid of one monster,

45:58.520 --> 46:02.143
means the next one's
waking up inside its cave.

46:02.971 --> 46:06.276
<i>Well, how would I know?
I'm just an ignoramus, me.</i>

46:06.308 --> 46:08.370
<i>What do I know about politics?</i>

46:08.395 --> 46:10.003
<i>I'm nowt but a fool!</i>

46:10.464 --> 46:12.073
Beware those men.

46:12.098 --> 46:15.706
The jokers and the
tricksters and the clowns.

46:16.526 --> 46:18.542
They will laugh us into hell.

46:20.138 --> 46:21.206
Did we get that?

46:21.590 --> 46:24.237
Yep. Can't have enough Muriel.

46:24.682 --> 46:25.839
My dad helped, though.

46:26.323 --> 46:28.861
He was part of it,
bringing down Mrs Rook.

46:29.158 --> 46:31.853
'Cos he'd kept that file,
the camps, the inmates.

46:32.049 --> 46:33.213
Huge part of the evidence.

46:33.238 --> 46:34.462
That's how he got
his sentence down.

46:34.486 --> 46:37.181
Yeah, but, Beth, there
were 500 whistle-blowers.

46:37.619 --> 46:39.289
He was just one
tiny little part of it.

46:39.314 --> 46:41.024
Okay, I like my version.

46:41.673 --> 46:44.126
I keep telling her there's
nothing special about our family.

46:44.424 --> 46:46.141
We lived through it, that's all.

46:46.174 --> 46:48.071
Like anyone. Like everyone.

46:48.585 --> 46:50.954
So, what happened to Stephen?

46:50.979 --> 46:54.011
Still went to prison. Three
years, because of the gun.

46:54.565 --> 46:57.102
But he used the time inside
to teach himself Spanish.

46:57.447 --> 46:59.345
That's what he does
now. Lives in Barcelona.

46:59.370 --> 47:01.024
Teaches English to Spanish kids.

47:01.357 --> 47:03.305
Oh, he didn't get
back together with...?

47:03.330 --> 47:04.330
No.

47:05.682 --> 47:07.095
Did you ever forgive him?

47:09.252 --> 47:10.284
Yeah.

47:11.899 --> 47:13.110
I got very ill.

47:13.751 --> 47:15.009
Christmas '31.

47:15.034 --> 47:16.384
We all thought it was the end.

47:53.580 --> 47:54.580
Did you get that?

47:56.572 --> 47:57.572
Yeah.

47:58.548 --> 47:59.937
That was strong.

48:00.055 --> 48:01.359
We're getting everything.

48:02.023 --> 48:04.663
They're beginning to think the
system can store an infinite amount.

48:05.180 --> 48:06.961
I like the way you
don't actually know.

48:09.062 --> 48:10.826
It's brand-new, all of it is.

48:10.851 --> 48:12.596
It's still an experiment.

48:13.101 --> 48:16.101
When I was a kid, I wanted
nothing more than to be downloaded.

48:16.126 --> 48:17.430
I dreamed of this.

48:17.455 --> 48:19.555
Putting my consciousness
into the machine.

48:20.450 --> 48:22.289
Now Auntie Edith's going first.

48:24.274 --> 48:25.953
Coded on to molecules of water.

48:25.978 --> 48:27.966
You'll be a
brand-new form of life.

48:27.991 --> 48:29.305
If it works.

48:30.178 --> 48:31.508
It will work.

48:32.564 --> 48:35.062
According to the doctors,
this is the day I die, but...

48:36.172 --> 48:37.336
I'm going to escape.

48:38.094 --> 48:39.383
Well, we can't be sure.

48:39.820 --> 48:42.258
We can download your
memories as information.

48:42.608 --> 48:45.265
Whether the
consciousness survives...

48:46.073 --> 48:49.249
If you still exist as Edith,

48:49.274 --> 48:50.350
inside there...

48:51.504 --> 48:52.686
we just don't know.

48:53.081 --> 48:54.311
I've got to live on,

48:54.444 --> 48:57.911
'cos I want to see
the next ten years,

48:57.936 --> 49:00.335
the next 100, the next 1,000.

49:02.446 --> 49:03.772
I want to know
where we're going.

49:03.797 --> 49:05.866
Into the shelters, if we
don't fix the weather.

49:06.007 --> 49:07.108
Exactly.

49:07.133 --> 49:08.475
And I want to find out.

49:09.014 --> 49:10.679
I've still got stuff to do.

49:10.976 --> 49:12.024
Like what?

49:12.571 --> 49:13.594
Vivienne Rook.

49:13.813 --> 49:14.881
I haven't finished with her.

49:14.905 --> 49:16.225
Because you're
heard the stories?

49:16.288 --> 49:17.288
She got away.

49:17.313 --> 49:19.311
That's just online chatter.

49:19.858 --> 49:21.366
But they never did find out.

49:21.391 --> 49:22.585
Who's behind her?

49:22.812 --> 49:24.412
Who paid for everything?

49:25.394 --> 49:26.460
And it's said,

49:27.320 --> 49:28.720
they stole her away.

49:30.262 --> 49:32.616
That woman? In prison?

49:33.807 --> 49:34.811
It's not her.

49:44.822 --> 49:45.913
She got away.

49:46.406 --> 49:48.291
They took her
somewhere in the world.

49:48.511 --> 49:49.912
Wherever she is,

49:50.982 --> 49:52.435
I will find her.

49:56.707 --> 49:58.826
I will enter that machine...

50:00.150 --> 50:05.542
and I'll become a
spirit, an imp, a sprite.

50:07.159 --> 50:11.115
And I will fly
across the oceans...

50:11.759 --> 50:13.889
and I will hunt her down.

50:14.810 --> 50:15.810
And then...

50:19.464 --> 50:20.967
Okay, calm down.

50:22.005 --> 50:25.834
We're crossing from
memory into... imagination.

50:25.859 --> 50:27.935
No. It just hasn't happened yet.

50:30.154 --> 50:32.303
And we're back.

50:34.170 --> 50:35.202
That's it.

50:36.867 --> 50:38.859
We're into the final stage now.

50:39.897 --> 50:41.022
I'd better go.

50:42.905 --> 50:44.606
What time is it, back at home?

50:45.131 --> 50:46.578
You're nine hours ahead.

50:46.811 --> 50:50.549
It's just gone two o'clock in the
afternoon here, Sunday dinner.

50:50.896 --> 50:53.240
You timed it perfectly,
just like the old days.

50:56.389 --> 50:57.904
We never did sell the house.

50:58.446 --> 51:02.438
Gran kept inviting buyers in
and then chasing them away.

51:02.463 --> 51:04.951
We scrimped and saved
and kept it on over the years.

51:05.174 --> 51:07.451
The old place just
sat there and waited...

51:09.045 --> 51:10.045
for today.

51:12.336 --> 51:13.938
And now everyone's come home.

51:15.236 --> 51:16.906
Dad's flown in from Spain.

51:16.931 --> 51:18.860
Rosie and the kids.
It's like they've...

51:20.782 --> 51:23.063
I was going to say, it's like
they've come to say goodbye,

51:23.338 --> 51:24.390
but it's not.

51:26.527 --> 51:27.837
They've come to say hello.

51:31.714 --> 51:33.212
I'll be there, don't worry.

51:34.556 --> 51:36.118
I'm coming to find you.

51:36.295 --> 51:37.954
You can't promise anything.

51:39.165 --> 51:40.165
I can.

51:41.658 --> 51:43.353
'Cos Fran's there...

51:44.581 --> 51:46.298
waiting for me, isn't she?

51:48.131 --> 51:49.251
She's downstairs.

51:49.930 --> 51:50.970
Tell her...

51:52.099 --> 51:53.220
I'm on my way.

51:54.818 --> 51:56.844
We're scaling down.

51:57.922 --> 52:00.774
Sorry, but life signs
will start to fail in about...

52:02.483 --> 52:03.703
five minutes.

52:07.189 --> 52:08.375
I can't watch.

52:09.720 --> 52:10.720
That's okay.

52:11.576 --> 52:12.594
Go home.

52:13.527 --> 52:14.641
I'll see you...

52:16.195 --> 52:17.516
on the other side.

52:38.695 --> 52:40.219
- Hey, Lincoln.
- Hi.

52:40.773 --> 52:41.899
Come on.

52:42.636 --> 52:43.636
We're ready.

52:48.410 --> 52:49.410
It's okay.

52:50.192 --> 52:51.484
She's all right.

52:55.535 --> 52:56.781
She's on her way.

52:57.061 --> 52:58.061
I hope.

53:00.109 --> 53:03.072
I don't know. They
can't promise anything.

53:06.391 --> 53:07.460
Oh, my God.

53:11.241 --> 53:12.305
I hope.

53:16.352 --> 53:17.593
I hope.

53:25.707 --> 53:26.929
I hope.

53:33.183 --> 53:34.710
Is it going to work?

53:37.390 --> 53:38.507
I don't know.

53:40.129 --> 53:41.129
Come on.

53:41.740 --> 53:42.740
Everyone.

54:05.405 --> 54:06.412
You okay?

54:12.370 --> 54:13.592
I think so.

54:14.526 --> 54:16.842
We're not supposed
to commit ourselves.

54:19.867 --> 54:22.514
But I'd like to say
it's been a privilege.

54:23.570 --> 54:25.326
Oh, hasn't it?

54:26.918 --> 54:28.060
All of it.

54:29.238 --> 54:30.943
Every last second.

54:50.229 --> 54:51.373
You're wrong.

54:52.477 --> 54:54.404
You know. You're
absolutely wrong.

54:55.073 --> 54:56.147
In what way?

54:56.425 --> 54:58.053
Everything you've stored.

54:59.425 --> 55:00.897
All the downloads.

55:02.858 --> 55:07.154
Those bits of me that
you've copied onto water.

55:08.834 --> 55:10.997
You've got no idea
what they really are.

55:14.679 --> 55:16.489
I'm not a piece of code.

55:17.618 --> 55:19.106
I'm not information.

55:20.721 --> 55:21.942
All these memories...

55:24.541 --> 55:26.142
they're not just facts,

55:26.416 --> 55:28.483
they're so much more than that.

55:30.581 --> 55:31.581
They're...

55:32.689 --> 55:34.033
my family...

55:35.671 --> 55:36.869
and my lover.

55:41.205 --> 55:42.634
They're my mum,

55:43.773 --> 55:44.947
and my brother

55:46.092 --> 55:48.092
who died years ago.

55:52.232 --> 55:53.431
They're love.

55:56.475 --> 55:59.619
That's what I'm becoming.

56:01.576 --> 56:02.666
Love.

56:04.376 --> 56:05.736
I am love.

56:36.688 --> 56:37.860
She's gone.

56:46.023 --> 56:47.829
Good afternoon, Signor.

56:48.676 --> 56:50.032
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

56:55.454 --> 56:56.657
Edith?

56:57.754 --> 56:59.094
Is that you?
