We'll go with your suggestion,
Dr. Morris.

19:30.670 --> 19:34.507
-Take him back to Trauma 1.
MORRIS: You can see your father
now.

19:34.541 --> 19:35.608
Let's go. You too.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.713
Hey, Sam, I left something for
you in your locker.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.415
-What is it?
-Oh, I can't say.

19:42.449 --> 19:46.453
But it's guaranteed to pump you
up. Ha.

19:46.486 --> 19:50.457
-Morris wants to give you a
pump?
-Not if I can help it.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.725
So are you playing tour guide
for your brother?

19:52.759 --> 19:55.328
Well, we've been to Navy Pier
and Sears Tower.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.730
But what he really wants to see
is a taping of Oprah.

19:57.764 --> 20:00.500
Kovac, I gotta say,
you always have perfect timing.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.902
I thought you staged all that
to welcome me back.

20:02.935 --> 20:06.306
You know, the break room was
open if you wanna go through
that.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.775
And I think the coffee's
only about two hours old.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.778
-I'll buy you a cup. Come on.
-All right.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.613
I'll be in the break room
if you need me.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.448
Take your time.

20:15.482 --> 20:19.752
Hey, Frank, would you mind
buying a couple dozen doughnuts?

20:19.786 --> 20:23.256
-Doughnuts?
-Yeah. My treat, for everyone.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.795
-Frank, you all right?
-You know what I think?

20:28.828 --> 20:31.798
I think Skye is an angel
sent to walk among us.

20:34.301 --> 20:35.768
Right.

how long we're gonna be here?

20:38.671 --> 20:40.773
Reschedule the home inspection
for Monday.

20:40.807 --> 20:44.010
Mr. Udecker, Tate just told me
he doesn't wanna be numbed up...

20:44.043 --> 20:45.578
...before I suture.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.814
-Tate said that?
-Wants to prove he's tough.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.950
Really? Okay.

20:50.983 --> 20:53.386
Okay? He's gonna be in a lot of
pain.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.721
-That's fine with you?
-No.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.290
If he wants to man up,
it's better to learn now.

20:57.324 --> 21:01.561
-It's cold out there in the real
world.
-He's 13. This is wrong and
cruel.

21:03.363 --> 21:04.831
No, I don't.

21:04.864 --> 21:07.867
Then who the hell are you
telling me how to raise my kid?

21:07.900 --> 21:10.737
Just do your job and sew up my
boy.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.406
Okay, boss. Whatever you say.

on the schedule? Here.

21:19.011 --> 21:21.881
-Uh, next week. Thanks.
-Good.

21:21.914 --> 21:25.017
Is there any chance you'll
consider being chief again?

21:25.051 --> 21:26.986
No.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.755
You know, Moretti's gone.

21:28.788 --> 21:33.760
And today, Anspaugh made Skye
the acting chief.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.762
Really?

21:35.795 --> 21:37.897
-How about you?
-Me? No.

21:37.930 --> 21:40.533
No, I'm years away from that.

21:40.567 --> 21:45.538
In fact, I was thinking maybe
it's time for me to start
looking around.

21:45.572 --> 21:48.375
-Build up my résumé.
-Leave County?

21:49.576 --> 21:51.511
I might need
a letter of recommendation.

21:51.544 --> 21:54.847
So I was wondering,
maybe you could write me one.

21:54.881 --> 21:59.952
Yeah, of course, Greg. But, uh,
if you wanna run an ER one
day...

21:59.986 --> 22:02.589
...there's no better place to
learn.

22:02.622 --> 22:05.458
Yeah, maybe.

22:05.492 --> 22:07.894
But I'm feeling real invisible
around here.

22:07.927 --> 22:11.464
Well, what have you been doing
to get attention?

22:11.498 --> 22:14.801
-What do you mean?
-Well, be proactive.

22:14.834 --> 22:19.472

administration you can make
their lives easier.

22:19.506 --> 22:21.574
What do they always complain
about?

22:21.608 --> 22:24.411
Document compliance,
medication reconciliation.

22:24.444 --> 22:27.113
Just give them a plan to fix it.

22:27.146 --> 22:29.616
Dr. Pratt, sats are down
on your pneumonia guy.

22:29.649 --> 22:32.485

22:32.519 --> 22:34.621
I'll let Abby know that you're
here.

-Thanks.
-It's good that you're back,

fingers for us?

-So, what about my dad's arm?

23:05.552 --> 23:09.121
He's suffered nerve and artery
damage and I doubt if we can
repair it.

23:09.155 --> 23:11.123
Okay, that's not good enough.

23:11.157 --> 23:15.695
If you leave a non-viable arm
attached, it could kill him.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.030
-I'll sign the consent.
-No, Ma.

23:18.064 --> 23:21.133

Dad's gonna lose everything.

How's he gonna work, okay?
How's he gonna drive?

23:23.736 --> 23:27.674
-How's he gonna play pool?
-There are a lot of great
prosthetics.

23:27.707 --> 23:32.479
Your father can live a long and
productive life without his arm.

You're gonna give the boy
anesthesia without telling him?

-Yeah. Gonna think he's toughing
it out.
-You can't without the dad's
consent.
