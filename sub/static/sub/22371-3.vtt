00:01.627 --> 00:04.870
<i>Man on radio: How double time it,
and meet us at the rally point?</i>

00:04.963 --> 00:06.579
<i>Radio back as soon as you're on post.</i>

00:08.175 --> 00:09.165
<i>Let's just keep pushing east.</i>

00:09.259 --> 00:11.421
They are coming for us.

00:11.512 --> 00:12.718
<i>Got a visual on two...</i>

00:12.804 --> 00:15.762
Coming for us at this very moment.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.967
A powerful force of bloodthirsty rogues

00:19.061 --> 00:20.517
and unrepentant cutthroats

00:20.604 --> 00:23.312
bent on nothing short than
our pitiless destruction.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.605
<i>...about 50 yards, on their way.</i>

00:25.692 --> 00:28.024
And yet I smile.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.579
And yet Carol smiles.

00:44.670 --> 00:45.910
(Man speaking indistinctly over radio)

00:46.004 --> 00:47.711
Why, boss?

01:06.525 --> 01:08.516
(Saviors whistling)

01:25.294 --> 01:28.286
They probably have the numbers.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.291
But we have strategy.

01:30.382 --> 01:32.840
(Ezekiel chuckles)

01:32.926 --> 01:36.294
Yes, we do.

01:57.951 --> 02:01.069
I am binding a hope to my heart,

02:01.163 --> 02:03.825
perhaps unwisely...

02:03.915 --> 02:05.952
but we have come this far,

02:06.043 --> 02:08.580
all of us, still here.

02:08.669 --> 02:11.583
If we follow this plan,
if we keep to our training,

02:11.673 --> 02:14.506
if the fates continue
to shine brightly upon us,

02:14.593 --> 02:16.834
allowing us this...

02:16.928 --> 02:19.010
this dream?

02:20.849 --> 02:23.591
We will lose not one of our ranks.

02:26.396 --> 02:29.263
We will lose not one of our ranks.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.402
Not one.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.948
We move onward.

02:44.039 --> 02:46.201
(Shiva growling)

02:46.291 --> 02:48.248
(roars)

02:48.335 --> 02:49.951
(theme music playing)

03:32.587 --> 03:34.203
(breathing heavily)

03:34.297 --> 03:36.880
Guns down... now.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.383
(guns tap softly)

03:48.770 --> 03:51.137
(breathes sharply)

03:51.231 --> 03:53.848
So, you're the Rick from Alexandria.

03:55.026 --> 03:58.109
This whole time, it was you.

03:58.196 --> 04:01.063
You called your men in for nothing.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.399
The fight's out there.
It's just me in here.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.860
Did you hear what I just said?

04:05.954 --> 04:07.911
I know who you are.

04:08.874 --> 04:11.206
I saw it in the mirror
through the open door.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.702
And it wasn't any kind of
blast from the past.

04:16.630 --> 04:19.043
As soon as I saw you...

04:19.134 --> 04:21.875
I knew you'd made the same trip as me.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.428
From there to here.

04:24.514 --> 04:25.595
(scoffs)

04:25.682 --> 04:29.767
Shit, well...

04:29.853 --> 04:32.470
Well, I guess we aren't the same guys
we used to be, huh?

04:33.899 --> 04:35.810
'Cause you're a monster.

04:38.153 --> 04:40.986
I called them back
because you're a prize, Rick.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.858
We've been told.

04:42.949 --> 04:47.409
We don't kill you, the Widow,
or the King...

04:47.496 --> 04:49.612
not if we don't have to.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.416
So why are you here, Rick?

04:56.046 --> 04:58.037
I know you...

04:58.131 --> 05:00.122
Just like before.

05:00.217 --> 05:03.380
You're always the guy willing to rush in.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.835
But Why?

05:04.930 --> 05:07.012
What is it you're looking for?

05:08.809 --> 05:10.595
Nothing to say, huh?

05:11.978 --> 05:13.468
It doesn't matter.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.520
Not anymore.

05:15.607 --> 05:19.475
Not for you or anyone else
you brought in here.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.981
'Cause what's left of my people...

05:22.072 --> 05:24.404
they're coming.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.358
And we'll get you to Negan.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.910
Or we won't.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.112
Either way,

05:32.207 --> 05:34.995
we're gonna settle your shit, peaches.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.788
(walker growling)

05:42.384 --> 05:44.921
Savior #1:
Come on, let's stay together!

05:45.011 --> 05:46.718
Savior #2: Falling back!

05:50.392 --> 05:51.723
(Savior #1 shouting indistinctly)

05:51.810 --> 05:53.392
"m going in!

05:56.398 --> 05:58.605
Hold fire! Hold fire!

05:58.692 --> 06:00.057
Morales wants us back inside!

06:00.151 --> 06:03.610
All force towards
the courtyard door on my mark!

06:03.697 --> 06:05.279
They stopped shooting.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.605
Savior #2 in distance:
On main flank, we need fire!

06:06.700 --> 06:08.282
(gunfire)

06:08.368 --> 06:10.780
No, they stopped shooting at us.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.111
Savior #2: Where's that backup?

06:13.832 --> 06:14.913
Savior #1: Fire from the rear!

06:16.918 --> 06:19.831
Go, go! Get in there!

06:24.509 --> 06:25.749
Savior #2: Go!

06:28.346 --> 06:30.587
(growlinQl)

06:33.768 --> 06:36.135
(groans)

06:36.229 --> 06:39.062
- (panting)
- Here. Here.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.810
(gunfire in distance)

06:40.901 --> 06:43.359
(gasping)

06:43.445 --> 06:45.061
It's okay. I got you.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.941
Okay, okay.

06:47.032 --> 06:48.693
I'm here.

06:48.783 --> 06:49.898
How bad is it?

06:49.993 --> 06:51.199
(groans)

06:53.246 --> 06:55.408
There's an exit wound.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.614
That's good.

06:57.709 --> 07:00.292
(gasping)

07:00.378 --> 07:02.369
(exhaling sharply)

07:04.049 --> 07:06.211
We can get you to the Kingdom's doctor.

07:07.469 --> 07:09.961
We just have to keep pressure.

07:10.055 --> 07:12.012
(gasping)

07:15.060 --> 07:17.142
Eric.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.888
I'm so sorry...

07:23.568 --> 07:25.400
Were you the one who shot me?

07:25.487 --> 07:27.103
(chuckles)

07:30.408 --> 07:32.615
I... I pulled you into this.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.158
You didn't want to fight.

07:35.830 --> 07:39.198
Until-- Until I did.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.255
- (sniffles)
- You need to help them--

07:46.341 --> 07:48.082
- What? I can't--
- You need to go.

07:48.176 --> 07:51.259
- I can bleed here fine on my own--
- I'm not leaving you.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.217
Don't be an idiot.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.014
They need you.

07:56.101 --> 07:57.967
Aaron, look at me.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.353
(sighs)

08:02.941 --> 08:04.523
Look at me.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.435
(sniffles)

08:09.781 --> 08:11.863
You know I love you.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.362
You know I'm right.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.319
(crying)

08:20.500 --> 08:21.615
(sniffles)

08:30.343 --> 08:32.674
- (sobbing)
- Okay.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.962
Now...

08:36.057 --> 08:37.967
stand your ass up,

08:38.058 --> 08:39.845
get back to the fight,

08:39.936 --> 08:41.768
and you win this thing.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.434
(clears throat)

08:45.525 --> 08:47.232
- I will.
- Okay.

08:51.322 --> 08:52.608
We will.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.904
I love you.

08:59.831 --> 09:02.118
I always had a hunch.

09:07.505 --> 09:09.496
(breathing shallowly)

09:13.386 --> 09:14.922
Now go.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.721
(sniffles)

09:43.374 --> 09:45.365
(birds chirping)

10:04.979 --> 10:07.266
Eduardo: When we get back,
we'll talk to Maggie.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.557
She'll know what to do with them.

10:14.405 --> 10:16.146
Yeah.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.902
She will.

10:19.494 --> 10:21.701
Because she knows what they did.

10:24.249 --> 10:26.240
(Jared whistling)

10:29.129 --> 10:31.120
(whistling continues)

10:41.683 --> 10:43.799
We're not far.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.600
From the Hilltop.

10:45.687 --> 10:48.770
We're far from somewhere else, I guess.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.524
- We made our decision--
- Nothing's been decided.

10:53.611 --> 10:56.649
Well, nothing's permanent
except impermanence, I guess.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.650
In that way, I'll agree.

10:59.909 --> 11:02.196
But we are taking these men
to the Hilltop.

11:03.246 --> 11:06.159
That's where we're going,
and that's what we're doing.

11:07.792 --> 11:10.500
You know how dangerous this is?

11:10.587 --> 11:12.203
Who these people are?

11:16.676 --> 11:19.168
No matter what they've done...

11:19.262 --> 11:20.718
they're people.

11:22.807 --> 11:25.174
There's many kinds of danger,

11:25.268 --> 11:27.054
many kinds of dying.

11:27.145 --> 11:28.727
I kill.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.395
I've killed.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.190
You do.

11:33.276 --> 11:34.858
You have.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.145
But we don't execute.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.782
I have.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.918
Is your family here?

12:01.596 --> 12:03.712
We never made it to Birmingham.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.257
They didn't.

12:08.353 --> 12:09.639
Rick: Well, I'm sorry.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.845
Really, Rick?

12:11.940 --> 12:13.476
I am.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.649
I lost people, too.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.028
Lori.

12:20.114 --> 12:21.946
Shane.

12:22.033 --> 12:23.819
Andrea.

12:25.036 --> 12:26.777
Glenn...

12:28.498 --> 12:31.581
Negan killed him.

12:33.336 --> 12:35.873
Forced him to his knees.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.502
Bashed his head in right in front of me.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.503
In front of his pregnant wife.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.636
He had a wife?

12:45.723 --> 12:47.339
Not before.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.265
He met her.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.310
In this?

12:53.648 --> 12:56.231
Yeah. In this.

12:57.151 --> 12:59.358
She's the Widow.

13:04.325 --> 13:08.034
Are you Negan, too?

13:11.040 --> 13:13.122
I lost my family.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.459
I lost my mind.

13:16.546 --> 13:18.958
I was in some tow trailer,

13:19.048 --> 13:21.210
sleeping myself to death.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.793
Waiting to become nothing.

13:23.886 --> 13:26.253
And the Saviors...

13:26.347 --> 13:28.679
they found me.

13:28.766 --> 13:32.100
They thought I was worth a damn.

13:32.186 --> 13:34.177
Worth bringing back with 'em.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.057
So, yeah.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.563
Yeah, I'm Negan.

13:40.653 --> 13:44.567
To make it this far, this long,

13:44.657 --> 13:47.069
I had to be.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.367
I had to be something.

13:49.454 --> 13:50.535
Just like you.

13:50.621 --> 13:52.111
- We're not the same.
- (scoffs)

13:52.206 --> 13:53.321
How's that?

13:53.416 --> 13:56.033
- Well, look at you.
- Look at me?

13:56.127 --> 13:57.492
Look at us, Rick.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.248
Look at us.

14:00.965 --> 14:03.377
We're two assholes
who'll do whatever we have to

14:03.468 --> 14:06.051
just to keep going.

14:06.137 --> 14:08.299
And the only difference is

14:08.389 --> 14:11.256
I'm the one holding the gun.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.184
That doesn't make me
any worse than you, Rick--

14:14.270 --> 14:16.511
that just makes me luckier.

14:17.482 --> 14:19.519
'Cause let's face it,

14:19.609 --> 14:21.566
if it wasn't me,

14:21.652 --> 14:24.269
if it was you holding the gun,

14:24.364 --> 14:26.446
I'd be brains out on the floor right now.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.399
- You don't know that.
- And you do?

14:29.494 --> 14:31.656
Huh?

14:31.746 --> 14:34.659
I know I wouldn't want to.

14:34.749 --> 14:36.911
Come on.

14:37.001 --> 14:39.083
Is that the best you can do?

14:40.713 --> 14:43.250
I'd-- I'd at least try
to find another way.

14:43.341 --> 14:44.502
Yeah? Why?

14:44.592 --> 14:46.799
'Cause we knew each other
for a few days back at the start?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.251
Look, I know--

14:48.346 --> 14:49.882
I-I wouldn't-- I wouldn't just--

14:49.972 --> 14:51.337
You want to know what I think?

14:51.432 --> 14:52.968
I think you can talk all you want.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.426
You can say all the words.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.136
Lofl,Shane,

14:57.230 --> 14:59.847
Andrea, Glenn...

15:01.442 --> 15:03.854
They're all dead,

15:03.945 --> 15:06.403
and somewhere along the way,

15:06.489 --> 15:09.857
Officer Friendly died
right along with 'em.

15:09.951 --> 15:13.489
Just like I did with them.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.162
That's what I know, Rick.

15:18.376 --> 15:19.491
Wait, no!

15:19.585 --> 15:20.575
(grunts)

15:20.670 --> 15:22.126
uhuds)

15:22.213 --> 15:23.624
You good?

15:29.887 --> 15:31.719
- That-- T-That was...
- I know who it was.

15:31.806 --> 15:34.298
It don't matter. Not one little bit.

15:37.728 --> 15:39.560
You find them guns?

15:44.861 --> 15:46.317
They aren't here.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.441
What?

15:51.826 --> 15:54.568
He called the Saviors back
from the courtyard.

15:54.662 --> 15:55.902
We gotta get out before--

15:55.997 --> 15:57.328
(door thuds open in distance)

15:59.459 --> 16:01.325
They're here.

16:05.756 --> 16:07.747
(birds chirping)

16:12.388 --> 16:15.801
You know, I've been trying to figure out
what's different about you.

16:15.892 --> 16:17.803
'Cause something's definitely different.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.269
(singsong voice)
I think I finally got it.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.059
(normal voice)
It's your armor.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.561
It's different.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.608
Smaller.

16:27.695 --> 16:29.356
Almost like it--

16:29.447 --> 16:31.859
like it shrunk or something.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.615
Oh, shit.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.571
Was that the kid's? It is, isn't it?

16:41.375 --> 16:42.957
Why the-- (chuckles)

16:43.044 --> 16:45.035
Why the hell would you wear that?

16:46.506 --> 16:48.998
Didn't do shit for him.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.172
(walker growling in distance)

16:53.262 --> 16:54.377
Woman: Walker's on the hill!

16:54.472 --> 16:55.633
(indistinct shouting)

16:55.723 --> 16:57.589
(walkers growling)

17:16.493 --> 17:18.280
(screaming)

17:38.349 --> 17:39.760
(screaming)

17:40.893 --> 17:42.008
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

17:42.103 --> 17:43.639
(screaming)

17:47.108 --> 17:48.815
Go! Go!

17:52.363 --> 17:54.195
Follow 'em! Come on!

17:55.950 --> 17:58.157
They got guns, huh? Stop!

18:07.878 --> 18:09.084
Jared: God!

18:09.171 --> 18:11.583
- Didn't make it this far to die!
- Come on!

18:16.262 --> 18:18.503
- (gunshots)
- Come on! Come on!

18:23.144 --> 18:25.226
- Go!
- Go left! Go left!

18:25.313 --> 18:26.974
- (grunts) No!
- Wait!

18:27.064 --> 18:29.021
Get up! Get up! Get up!
Get him up! Come on. Come on.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.269
Pull him up!
Get him up! Get him up!

18:30.359 --> 18:32.942
- (grunts) Wait!
- Get up.

18:36.032 --> 18:38.194
Savior POW:
Don't shoot! Please! We give up!

18:38.284 --> 18:40.070
(gunshon

18:42.121 --> 18:43.361
Morgan. Stop.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.493
Come on. On your feet. Let's go.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.494
They ran off to get away.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.376
Then what happens after?

18:50.463 --> 18:52.420
- We stopped them.
- And they keep trying.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.338
Again and again.

18:54.425 --> 18:55.665
What, you think they were gonna come back?

18:55.760 --> 18:58.718
That they will change?
That they will be something else?

18:58.804 --> 19:00.420
It doesn't change.

19:00.514 --> 19:01.845
It never changes.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.343
- Once you turn--
- Morgan.

19:04.852 --> 19:07.344
We're gonna find another way.

19:07.438 --> 19:10.351
Maggie will find another way.

19:10.441 --> 19:13.399
Really think she won't want 'em dead?

19:13.486 --> 19:16.023
Every last one? After what they've done?

19:17.657 --> 19:19.773
And it isn't just them.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.733
'Cause we're here now,

19:21.827 --> 19:23.659
to be this,

19:23.746 --> 19:25.407
do the same thing they do,

19:25.498 --> 19:27.080
but we go on.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.032
You see, we are the same--

19:29.126 --> 19:31.037
- Morgan.
- We're the same.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.082
We're the same,

19:37.176 --> 19:39.634
so there's no choice.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.428
Everybody turns, but w-we w--

19:42.515 --> 19:45.303
There's war, and then there's peace.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.932
We're gonna have to live
with these people after.

19:51.023 --> 19:54.311
We're gonna have to find a way to peace.

20:00.116 --> 20:02.574
Morgan...

20:33.274 --> 20:35.060
Ezekiel: Make no mistake,

20:35.151 --> 20:37.438
those we've so swiftly extinguished

20:37.528 --> 20:41.613
are but perhaps one garrison
in a compound of three.

20:41.699 --> 20:43.781
(gunfire)

20:55.045 --> 20:57.127
(gunfire)

20:57.214 --> 21:00.707
But our first victory
will allow our second.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.463
Our second will deliver our third.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.966
Man:
Come on! Come on! Let's go!

21:24.867 --> 21:26.278
Clear.

21:29.413 --> 21:31.825
- Rick: Damn it!
- Man: It's them!

21:33.083 --> 21:34.494
- (man shouts indistinctly)
- There! Go!

21:34.585 --> 21:37.498
(gunfire continues)

22:18.170 --> 22:19.706
Jesus: Okay.

22:19.797 --> 22:21.208
You're having a little trouble.

22:33.477 --> 22:34.967
(growls)

22:38.482 --> 22:40.314
You want to stop now?

22:43.279 --> 22:44.769
Maybe not?

23:10.055 --> 23:12.342
Daryl: Hey! Hey!

23:12.433 --> 23:14.424
I'm out!

23:25.696 --> 23:27.357
Hey!

23:30.701 --> 23:32.487
Come on!

23:32.578 --> 23:34.535
(gunfire continues)

23:39.627 --> 23:42.540
(man screaming)

23:48.552 --> 23:50.168
Aaron:
Teams of four, sweep the offices!

23:50.262 --> 23:52.378
- Rick: Aaron!
- Rick!

23:52.473 --> 23:54.714
We're by the elevator!

24:23.587 --> 24:26.204
Is it over, Morgan?

24:39.103 --> 24:40.844
Is it?

24:48.696 --> 24:50.061
What?

25:05.004 --> 25:06.915
I'm not right.

25:08.674 --> 25:10.756
I know that-- I'm not right.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.923
But that doesn't make me wrong.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.563
I can't be a part of this.

25:26.650 --> 25:28.232
Tara: Morgan.

25:30.195 --> 25:32.607
You are right.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.724
(horn honking in distance)

26:14.615 --> 26:15.980
It's him.

26:16.950 --> 26:18.406
Hey!

26:19.703 --> 26:21.364
Hello!

26:22.206 --> 26:23.867
Open the gates!

26:26.710 --> 26:28.121
I need help!

26:29.338 --> 26:31.454
I've been through hell!

26:33.217 --> 26:35.959
I know you're in there!
I know you can hear me!

26:43.393 --> 26:44.724
(sighs)

26:45.270 --> 26:46.760
What, is the gate broken?

26:46.855 --> 26:49.017
I told them to oil that--

26:52.152 --> 26:53.438
The gate's not broken.

26:53.529 --> 26:55.896
What are you doing with Gabriel's car?

26:55.989 --> 26:57.696
Where is he?

26:57.783 --> 26:59.194
I don't know who that is.

26:59.284 --> 27:02.822
The-- The car was just there.

27:02.913 --> 27:04.574
So what are you doing here?

27:04.665 --> 27:05.996
I live here.

27:06.083 --> 27:07.824
This is my home.

27:07.918 --> 27:09.454
I built this place.

27:09.545 --> 27:12.458
You weren't here for that,
but some of us didn't just show up.

27:12.548 --> 27:14.459
Shut your damn mouth!

27:15.467 --> 27:17.083
You're really gonna
stand there and pretend

27:17.177 --> 27:18.667
you didn't try to sell us out,

27:18.762 --> 27:20.503
sell this place out to the Saviors?!

27:20.597 --> 27:22.679
I was working for the side of sanity.

27:22.766 --> 27:24.052
I was working for peace.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.601
- You threatened to kick people out.
- I tried to save lives.

27:26.687 --> 27:28.143
Now those people are cannon fodder.

27:28.230 --> 27:29.686
Those people are fighting
for a better life.

27:29.773 --> 27:33.061
(sighs) Look, the "throwing out
the families" line was all Negan.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.564
He made me say those horrible things.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.066
I went to them in-- in-- in--

27:38.157 --> 27:40.239
you know, in the interest of--

27:40.325 --> 27:42.692
of furthering (stammers)

27:42.786 --> 27:45.118
good-faith diplomacy.

27:45.205 --> 27:47.788
I tried to save lives.

27:47.875 --> 27:49.832
Some people,

27:49.918 --> 27:52.706
without opinions colored by

27:52.796 --> 27:54.503
a preoccupation with vengeance,

27:54.590 --> 27:56.172
might call that heroic.

27:56.258 --> 27:58.795
You were looking out for yourself.

27:58.886 --> 28:00.502
You went there to betray us.

28:00.596 --> 28:02.963
To warn Negan
that we were gonna fight.

28:03.056 --> 28:05.764
That's what you told Kal
when you dragged him there.

28:05.851 --> 28:08.218
It's why Kal left you there.

28:08.312 --> 28:09.302
Kal? (scoffs)

28:09.396 --> 28:11.603
- Kal is delusional.
- What the hell?

28:12.774 --> 28:13.764
Kal!

28:13.859 --> 28:15.224
Hey. Come on, man.

28:15.319 --> 28:16.901
Y-You-- You know you can be dramatic.

28:16.987 --> 28:19.604
That thing with
the sorghum pancakes, huh?

28:19.698 --> 28:21.655
You mean when you ate
a little girl's pancakes?

28:21.742 --> 28:24.700
I did not eat those pancakes!

28:24.786 --> 28:25.947
(sighs)

28:26.038 --> 28:28.450
Listen, for what it's worth...

28:29.791 --> 28:32.408
I did exactly zero harm to your cause.

28:32.502 --> 28:34.163
Negan already knew everything.

28:34.254 --> 28:35.870
Good-bye, Gregory.

28:35.964 --> 28:38.331
Wait! No! Please!

28:38.425 --> 28:41.668
L-- All right, I went there
because I was scared, all right?

28:41.762 --> 28:43.093
I knew you were going to fight,

28:43.180 --> 28:45.922
and-- and I didn't want to be complicit.

28:47.142 --> 28:49.304
Because I didn't think you could win.

28:49.394 --> 28:52.261
But I see now what--
what you saw all along.

28:52.356 --> 28:55.565
That-- That-- That the Saviors
can't be reasoned with.

28:55.651 --> 28:58.769
That fighting them is the only way.

28:59.863 --> 29:02.025
I was wrong.

29:02.115 --> 29:05.278
I-I-I made a mistake,

29:05.369 --> 29:07.701
and I'm sorry.

29:07.788 --> 29:10.530
Please, Maggie.

29:10.624 --> 29:12.160
We're all just human beings

29:12.251 --> 29:15.835
with faults and flaws and-- and fears!

29:18.757 --> 29:21.169
But is this who you are?

29:22.386 --> 29:24.798
H-Have you no mercy?

29:26.098 --> 29:28.385
Have you no humanity?

29:28.475 --> 29:29.965
Have you no charity?

29:30.060 --> 29:32.267
(voice breaking)
Please! Open the gate.

29:33.397 --> 29:36.139
Open your heart.

29:36.233 --> 29:39.976
Don't leave another human being
out here to die!

29:44.408 --> 29:45.694
Let him in.

29:47.703 --> 29:49.614
(gate creaking)

29:51.456 --> 29:53.197
With everything he did...

29:53.292 --> 29:54.908
Why?

29:55.002 --> 29:57.744
He's not worth killin'.

29:57.838 --> 29:59.169
Not yet, anyway.

29:59.256 --> 30:00.872
You won't regret this.

30:00.966 --> 30:03.879
I've changed.
I-I'm a believer now.

30:03.969 --> 30:05.710
You'll see.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.841
Uh... Maggie?

30:11.143 --> 30:13.305
Gregory:
We are not letting them in!

30:13.395 --> 30:14.851
No way!

30:14.938 --> 30:16.975
With what they did?
With what they do?

30:17.065 --> 30:18.521
They are monsters!

30:18.608 --> 30:19.848
<i>-
' No'.!</i>

30:19.943 --> 30:21.433
This is not a sanctuary for killers.

30:21.528 --> 30:23.269
We'll be putting the safety
of everyone in jeopardy!

30:23.363 --> 30:24.819
Get out of here.

30:24.906 --> 30:26.317
I know what they are.

30:26.408 --> 30:29.150
- I have stared into the face of th--
- Gregory!

30:29.244 --> 30:30.359
Go.

30:38.253 --> 30:41.291
- He actually came back after all that.
- And I actually let him in.

30:43.717 --> 30:46.300
No offense, Jesus,
but I kind of agree with that prick.

30:47.471 --> 30:49.212
There are families here.

30:49.306 --> 30:50.842
Children.

30:50.932 --> 30:52.969
There's two empty trailers out back.

30:53.060 --> 30:54.801
We could lock them up in there
with 'round-the-clock guards

30:54.895 --> 30:56.932
until this whole thing is over.

30:57.022 --> 30:58.262
And go from there.

30:58.357 --> 30:59.939
You know what they've done to us.

31:00.025 --> 31:01.390
What they've taken from us.

31:01.485 --> 31:03.226
Of course I do.

31:04.363 --> 31:05.899
But they surrendered.

31:05.989 --> 31:07.946
Jesus...

31:09.159 --> 31:10.570
(scoffs)

31:10.660 --> 31:13.072
We can't let them go,

31:13.163 --> 31:15.074
and we can't kill them.

31:18.752 --> 31:20.584
We can't.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.839
(walkers growling)

31:51.785 --> 31:54.618
(crossbow firing)

33:30.884 --> 33:32.716
Aaron!

33:44.648 --> 33:46.639
(walker growls in distance)

34:05.669 --> 34:07.660
(crying)

34:18.556 --> 34:20.297
<i>(cries)</i>

34:27.315 --> 34:29.726
(sobbing) He's there.

34:29.818 --> 34:31.308
Eric's there.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.484
(sniffles)

34:32.571 --> 34:36.690
I can't...

34:38.284 --> 34:40.777
I can't just let him...

34:40.870 --> 34:42.485
Aaron...

34:42.581 --> 34:44.538
that's not him.

34:44.623 --> 34:46.364
(sobbing)

34:46.458 --> 34:48.574
Okay-

34:48.670 --> 34:50.159
Oh!

34:50.255 --> 34:51.585
- Oh.
- We gotta go.

34:51.672 --> 34:53.630
No. No.

34:53.717 --> 34:55.458
Come on.

35:10.191 --> 35:11.977
Scott: Guns aren't here.

35:12.068 --> 35:13.729
We gotta go right now, people!

35:13.820 --> 35:17.063
They're gonna pull away the herd,
but we aren't taking any chances!

35:27.292 --> 35:29.283
(baby crying)

35:32.297 --> 35:34.208
Tobin: She was inside?

35:35.342 --> 35:37.208
She was.

35:37.302 --> 35:39.168
- (engine starts)
- I have a--

35:39.262 --> 35:41.344
I have a stop to make,
and Daryl's got his bike.

35:41.431 --> 35:44.014
Maybe she can go back
with you or Scott...

35:44.100 --> 35:46.432
Aaron:
She can go with me.

35:49.022 --> 35:52.265
I can, uh, t-take her to the Hilltop.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.564
She'll be safe there.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.656
Aaron.

36:01.743 --> 36:03.359
You sure?

36:03.995 --> 36:05.781
Eric and I were gonna go up...

36:05.872 --> 36:07.283
<i>(cries)</i>

36:07.374 --> 36:11.459
We were gonna go there after
and update Maggie.

36:11.544 --> 36:14.332
So... that's what I'm gonna do.

36:19.678 --> 36:22.295
Please.

36:22.389 --> 36:24.426
(whispering) I have to.

36:24.516 --> 36:25.927
Yeah.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.892
Her name's Gracie.

36:35.652 --> 36:38.770
- (vehicle doors close)
- (engine starts)

36:38.863 --> 36:40.945
Hey, Gracie.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.238
Rick: See you back home.

36:45.328 --> 36:47.410
Daryl: Sure you wanna talk
to them assholes alone?

36:47.497 --> 36:48.862
Yeah.

36:48.957 --> 36:50.447
That's how it gets done.

36:50.542 --> 36:52.954
All right. You're gone too long,
I'm gonna come lookin' for you.

36:53.044 --> 36:54.785
- That's the plan.
- (gunshots)

37:11.771 --> 37:13.432
Hey!

37:14.941 --> 37:16.648
Hey!

37:17.485 --> 37:19.852
You're alone.

37:19.946 --> 37:21.687
You got to be.

37:21.781 --> 37:24.773
There's not enough room
for two of you behind that tree.

37:26.202 --> 37:28.034
And there's a herd coming.

37:28.121 --> 37:30.112
I'm just sayin'.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.495
Hey, I tell you what...

37:40.258 --> 37:42.625
we'll make you a deal.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.924
You drop your gun and come on out...

37:47.015 --> 37:49.382
you tell us what we need to know.

37:49.476 --> 37:51.717
You do that,

37:51.811 --> 37:53.347
you can take a car.

37:53.438 --> 37:55.349
You go. You live.

37:57.192 --> 37:58.398
How about it?

38:00.653 --> 38:02.018
Todd: Why should I trust you?

38:02.113 --> 38:04.320
'Cause I'm giving you my word.

38:06.409 --> 38:08.821
There's not a lot
that's worth much these days...

38:10.497 --> 38:12.829
but a man's word...

38:12.916 --> 38:15.374
that's got to mean something, right?

38:17.504 --> 38:19.370
Todd: Okay.

38:33.394 --> 38:35.101
Todd:
W-What do you wanna know?

38:37.565 --> 38:41.308
Rick: You ever have any M2 Browning
.50-caliber guns here?

38:43.696 --> 38:45.687
We did. For a while.

38:45.782 --> 38:47.398
What happened to 'em?

38:47.492 --> 38:49.904
They got sent to
another outpost yesterday.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.663
- Which one?
- It was Gavin's.

38:54.749 --> 38:56.786
It's west of here.

39:03.424 --> 39:06.712
Can I, uh... can... can I go?

39:12.642 --> 39:14.929
Which team's at Gavin's?

39:32.996 --> 39:36.785
Everyone is accounted for, Your Majesty.

39:40.503 --> 39:41.789
Carol: Ezekiel?

39:43.339 --> 39:46.377
Not one.

39:49.554 --> 39:52.137
We need to sweep the compound.

39:52.223 --> 39:55.136
Your counsel, your plan.

39:55.226 --> 39:57.092
Let me take a look...

40:00.315 --> 40:03.649
If we're gonna be here a while,
might as well take care of them.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.817
We should do it either way, man.

40:17.540 --> 40:19.451
We or they.

40:19.542 --> 40:21.283
One or the other.

40:21.377 --> 40:23.664
It cannot be...

40:26.299 --> 40:28.165
Scatter, now!

40:28.259 --> 40:29.670
Cover the King!

40:30.929 --> 40:32.260
No!

40:34.766 --> 40:36.757
(theme music playing)
