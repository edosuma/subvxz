11:05.957 --> 11:09.544
Actually, Candace got abducted by aliens
and taken to another planet,

11:09.627 --> 11:11.296
and we need your help to rescue her.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.840
Well, why did you not lead with that?

11:13.923 --> 11:18.011
I suppose you will want me to build
another portal. Where is the planet?

11:19.554 --> 11:20.930
That is, like, eight systems away.

11:21.014 --> 11:24.142
We will need a much more powerful
quantum field generator.

11:24.225 --> 11:25.268
But could we do it?

11:25.352 --> 11:28.021
Yes, but even if we got
the whole gang together,

11:28.104 --> 11:30.315
it would still take at least a montage.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.735
And we're done.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.905
Well, I guess I stand corrected.
It only took a flip wipe.

11:36.988 --> 11:40.241
So, this portal will take us to
the same planet they're taking Candace to?

11:40.325 --> 11:44.037
Yep. When we step through this portal,
we're gonna be on an alien planet,

11:44.120 --> 11:46.456
and we have no idea what to expect.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.291
Actually,
I took the liberty of printing out

11:48.375 --> 11:50.835
some computer simulations
of possible scenarios.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.629
Based on the infinite possibilities,

11:52.712 --> 11:54.547
we could be attacked by
carnivorous plants,

11:54.631 --> 11:56.758
giant alien spiders,
flying shark creatures.

11:57.300 --> 12:01.304
Oh, here is one where we would have
to sacrifice Buford to giant alien robots.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.057
-What?
-Are there any that are not terrifying?

12:04.140 --> 12:07.143
Oh, of course.
Here is a bunch of playful puppies...

12:07.227 --> 12:08.144
Aw.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.896
...that shoot nerve gas
from their tongues.

12:09.979 --> 12:10.814

Look, what Baljeet is saying is,
this could get really dangerous.

12:14.234 --> 12:18.154
Ferb and I appreciate your help building
the portal, but we can't ask you to go.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.115
Candace is our sister.

12:20.198 --> 12:22.867
She was pretty upset
the last time we saw her,

12:22.951 --> 12:25.495
and I kinda feel like somehow
it's our fault.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.748
So we're the ones
who have to make this right.

We have to get to Feebla-Oot

And my daughter was apparently abducted
by an alien pod from there.

13:38.193 --> 13:40.445

on social media. Look, see?

That's Vanessa. We know her.

13:43.573 --> 13:45.909
Oh, I hope my little girl is okay.

13:45.992 --> 13:49.996
[shouts] There is an ion barrier
around the planet.

Our transporters were both deflected,
which made them connect to each other.

13:53.500 --> 13:57.170

is astrologically impossible.

13:57.253 --> 13:58.880
You mean "astronomically."

13:58.963 --> 14:01.341
No, I mean astrologically.

the exact same functions as a spaceship,

a device that makes things switch places

to get to the planet.

26:51.069 --> 26:52.320
Yeah, so?

26:52.404 --> 26:55.281
So, if we go through the ion barrier
without a shield,

26:55.365 --> 26:57.325
it could fry all of the electronics
on the ship,

26:57.409 --> 27:01.329

So, Chosen One,

36:51.294 --> 36:54.881
how does it feel to be the most

You know, it feels great.

Thanks to Super Super Big Doctor,
for the first time ever, I feel like...

Now, I believe our leader has a special

When I scoured the universe
for Remarkalonium,

37:26.037 --> 37:29.290
what I didn't know was
that I'd also find a sister.

37:29.374 --> 37:30.667
[audience] Aw.

37:30.750 --> 37:33.003
Candace, would you do me the honor...

37:33.795 --> 37:35.463

-What? What are you doing here?

I'm about to duet.

Oh, sorry. Super Super Big Doctor,
these are my brothers, et cetera...

38:02.615 --> 38:03.950
I have no idea who that is.

38:04.034 --> 38:06.745
Oh, I'm Heinz.
I'm looking for my daughter, Vanessa.

38:06.828 --> 38:10.290
Wears black. Does this a lot,
[imitates Vanessa] "Dad."

38:10.373 --> 38:13.293
Oh, no, I sent her off in an escape pod.
She should be back on Earth by now.

38:13.376 --> 38:15.712
Oh, well, that's a relief.
She's out of danger.

38:16.379 --> 38:19.591
Uh... nice alien dragon creature.

38:20.383 --> 38:21.885
We came to rescue you.

38:21.968 --> 38:24.179
Rescue me? From what?

38:24.262 --> 38:25.930
A planet where people worship me?

38:26.014 --> 38:27.849
A place where I'm finally special?

38:27.932 --> 38:29.893
I'm the Chosen One for crying out loud.

38:30.393 --> 38:32.645
[audience together]
Chosen One. Chosen One.

38:32.729 --> 38:36.524
Oh, well, that's neat,
but, uh, chosen for what exactly?

38:36.608 --> 38:38.443
To save the planet, okay?

38:38.526 --> 38:41.738
-Ugh. Why don't you want me to be happy?
-We do, Candace.

38:41.821 --> 38:43.365
Actually, we made you a gift.

38:43.448 --> 38:45.700
A gift?
A gift isn't going to solve anything.

38:45.784 --> 38:47.702
-You know what? I don't want it.
-But--

38:47.786 --> 38:50.413
I have everything I ever wanted
right here.

38:50.497 --> 38:53.625
She gets me. She sees me.

38:53.708 --> 38:57.379
I finally feel like the universe
isn't against me.

38:57.462 --> 39:00.298
And I can't help but think, but,
you know, maybe...

39:00.382 --> 39:02.133
that's because you guys aren't around.

39:04.886 --> 39:07.889
I think perhaps
you should give her a little space.

39:07.972 --> 39:10.767
Don't worry, Candy-cane.
I'm gonna take care of these guys.

39:10.850 --> 39:12.560
Would you? You're the best.

39:12.644 --> 39:16.439
Braxington-ton, could you find a spot
for our guests to relax?

39:16.523 --> 39:18.983
If you'll follow me,
I'll take you to your accommodations.

39:22.153 --> 39:23.196
Candace.

39:28.326 --> 39:30.662
Give it up for the Chosen One.

39:30.745 --> 39:35.000
[applause]

39:36.626 --> 39:38.420
I can't believe Candace.

39:38.503 --> 39:40.797
I mean, I know sometimes she seems kinda--

39:40.880 --> 39:42.215
-Obsessive?
-Volatile?

39:42.298 --> 39:44.884
Enchanting? I mean, uh, terrifying.

39:44.968 --> 39:46.636
I was gonna say "unhappy."

39:46.720 --> 39:49.472
But I had no idea how unhappy she's been.

39:49.556 --> 39:50.890
Here we are.

39:51.558 --> 39:52.559
[all gasp]

39:56.396 --> 40:00.358
Well, you gotta admit this is a step up
from that horrifying jungle.

40:00.442 --> 40:02.986
I guess it pays to know the Chosen--

40:09.659 --> 40:11.578
-Ow!
-Oh, there it is.

40:19.127 --> 40:21.629
Uh, guys, did anyone else happen to notice

40:21.713 --> 40:23.548
that they dropped us
down a trapdoor into a shaft

40:23.631 --> 40:27.135
then launched us into this truck
which is driving us who knows where?

40:27.552 --> 40:31.097
Um, hi there.
Do you fellas know where this bus goes?

40:31.181 --> 40:33.141
-We're going to prison.
-What?

40:33.224 --> 40:36.102
That Super Super Big Doofus
sent us up the river.

40:36.186 --> 40:38.313
Well, little miss
"look at all my patches,"

40:38.396 --> 40:40.482
if you hadn't insisted on leading,

40:40.565 --> 40:42.901
we probably wouldn't be in this mess
in the first place.

40:43.735 --> 40:47.238
Do you see this patch?
Pray you never find out what it's for.

40:47.322 --> 40:48.865
Okay, Isabella.

40:48.948 --> 40:51.868
While I love ominous
patch-related threats more than anyone--

-[Ferb clears throat]
-Right. Apart from Ferb. Big fan.

40:55.372 --> 40:59.626
The bottom line is, we're in trouble.
And I have a feeling Candace is too.

41:17.060 --> 41:19.729
Thank you, Stapler Fist.
You're growing back nicely.

41:19.813 --> 41:23.274
Be honest, does this butt make
my torso look small? [chuckles]

41:23.900 --> 41:28.613
Oh, there she is.
The Chosen One is in the dining room.

41:28.697 --> 41:30.365
Oh, uh, thanks.

41:30.448 --> 41:33.952

Listen, I was proud of you today.

41:34.035 --> 41:35.912
-You really stood up for yourself.
-[sighs]

41:35.995 --> 41:39.165
You don't think I was, I don't know,
a little too hard on my brothers?

41:39.249 --> 41:42.085
Heck no, girl. You don't need them
messing up things for you.

41:42.168 --> 41:43.670
[sighs] I guess you're right.

41:43.753 --> 41:46.256
Trust me. Same story with my brothers.

41:46.339 --> 41:48.758
Everyone thought they were so special.

41:48.842 --> 41:49.843
So I had to--

41:51.511 --> 41:52.721
Pardon me, Your Bigness.

41:55.140 --> 41:57.726
So I had to find my own place
in the universe.

41:57.809 --> 42:00.603
Just like you're doing right now.

42:01.688 --> 42:04.107
I got to go deal with some
boring leader-y stuff.

42:04.190 --> 42:05.817
You stay here. Eat, drink.

42:05.900 --> 42:10.405
And don't forget to breathe... a lot.
If you need anything, just ask.

[sighs] It's no use.

42:50.862 --> 42:53.823
As soon as we get to prison,
I'm gonna start a gang.

-Who's in?
-Oh, oh. Me!

-Anyone? Anyone at all?
-Me. Me! Me.

could be of some help to us.

-[aliens whimper]
-Hi, again.

43:03.416 --> 43:05.126
There's no reason to be scared of us.

43:05.210 --> 43:08.922
Oh, we don't need a reason.
We're afraid of a lot of things.

43:09.005 --> 43:13.677
Things like loud noises, our shadows,
the dark, public speaking,

43:13.760 --> 43:17.389
anything with wheels, large magnets,
small magnets,

43:17.472 --> 43:22.727
water, cloudy skies, clear skies,
things from the sea, tall shelves...

43:28.566 --> 43:33.029
And we're also afraid of monsters,
clowns, people who look like clowns,

43:33.113 --> 43:37.450
spiders, people who look like spiders,
spiders who look like clowns,

43:39.160 --> 43:40.537
Oh, great idea, Ferb.

43:40.620 --> 43:42.706
Maybe if we remove
some of these components,

43:42.789 --> 43:45.667
-it will stop the vehicle.
-...making conversation at parties...

43:54.801 --> 43:57.887
[Monogram on comm] Oh, Agent P,
I completely forgot to tell you.

43:57.971 --> 44:02.809
Whatever you do, do not engage in any
kind of physical conflict with the aliens.

44:02.892 --> 44:05.895
It could put you in violation
of numerous intergalactic treaties.

44:05.979 --> 44:07.647
-[whimpering]
-It's working.

44:07.731 --> 44:08.982
[Monogram] Any advanced encounter

44:09.065 --> 44:10.942
will almost certainly
be peaceful and welcoming.

44:11.026 --> 44:13.653
But don't make any aggressive movements
or facial expressions

44:13.737 --> 44:15.238
that might displease them.

44:15.321 --> 44:17.824
Also be careful not to damage
any alien property.

44:17.907 --> 44:19.576
[chuckles] That stuff is expensive.

44:20.035 --> 44:23.163
And those alien insurance agencies
really stick it to ya.

Strive to respect and preserve their
planet's vegetation and natural beauty.

44:26.666 --> 44:30.253
And above all,
avoid aggression at all costs.

44:30.879 --> 44:34.674
You have such a lovely way with words,
so use diplomacy.

44:38.511 --> 44:40.930
All right.
Well, thank goodness we're okay.

44:42.766 --> 44:45.310
Oh. Yeah, maybe not now.

44:47.937 --> 44:50.190
Yeah. Definitely not now.

44:51.358 --> 44:52.484
[Monogram] Anyway, Agent P,

44:52.567 --> 44:55.570
I'm sure you've already
taken this into consideration. Good luck.

44:58.865 --> 45:01.618
We stopped. Whatever we did, it worked!

45:06.039 --> 45:09.542
Hmm. That's weird. No guards, no nothing.

-Excuse me.

we have come to a place of safety.

45:52.669 --> 45:54.671
Everyone, climb aboard.

46:00.260 --> 46:04.764
Behold, the city of Cowardalia.

46:05.598 --> 46:07.600
[Buford] So, you live
in these big statues?

46:07.684 --> 46:09.561
[Borthos] Uh, no, no, no.

46:09.644 --> 46:13.815
That's just monuments we built up.
The city is beyond those and--

46:13.898 --> 46:16.359
Oh, Borthos, come on.

46:23.033 --> 46:26.077
-[inhales]
-The hidden city of Cowardalia.

46:26.536 --> 46:28.788
Really, Ernox? Really?

46:29.622 --> 46:31.541
[sighs] Make yourself at home.

46:32.125 --> 46:35.420
Borthos, you escaped from the scary ones.

46:35.503 --> 46:38.048
Did you hide under a tarp?
Did you cower under some boxes?

46:38.131 --> 46:40.675
Did you stand very still
and pretend to be modern art?

46:40.759 --> 46:44.596
No, Garnoz, we did not hide or cower
or stand still.

46:44.679 --> 46:47.849
Although Brizak over there
is an excellent example of cubism.

46:49.684 --> 46:51.561
These aliens helped us escape.

46:51.644 --> 46:52.979
Thank you for saving my people.

46:53.063 --> 46:56.816
You may hide and cower with us here
in Cowardalia as long as you wish.

46:56.900 --> 46:59.152
Thanks for the offer,
but we're worried about our sister.

46:59.235 --> 47:00.945
We've got to get back to her somehow.

47:01.029 --> 47:02.906
And I have to get back
to my daughter on Earth.

47:02.989 --> 47:06.034
We would love to help you,
but we really can't.

47:06.117 --> 47:08.078
-We're cowards.
-Let me explain.

47:08.161 --> 47:11.247
We used to be a free
and happy cowardly people.

47:11.664 --> 47:13.750
Then one day, she arrived.

47:16.503 --> 47:19.923
And she brought with her
her evil plant of doom.

47:21.633 --> 47:26.262
She sprayed us with mind-controlling
spores and put herself in charge.

47:28.556 --> 47:30.850
She forced us to build her castle...

47:31.976 --> 47:33.728
lavish her with treasures...

47:35.230 --> 47:37.440
and make low-quality TV shows.

47:39.484 --> 47:41.319
[laughs]

47:42.070 --> 47:44.656
-[buzz]
-[forced laughter]

47:44.739 --> 47:47.742
Then one day,
the spores began to disappear.

47:47.826 --> 47:50.078
Our minds became clear.

47:50.161 --> 47:52.747
So we did the only thing
that we could do...

47:53.540 --> 47:55.917
We ran away like frightened toddlers.

47:56.501 --> 47:59.671
Sadly, some of our people
are still under her control.

48:01.339 --> 48:04.342
And now we hear
that she has found someone unique.

48:04.426 --> 48:09.222
Someone with the innate power to make
her sinister shrubbery grow once more.

48:09.848 --> 48:12.350
[all gasp] The Chosen One.

48:12.434 --> 48:14.144
What the heck is this thing?

48:15.145 --> 48:16.438
[shouts]

48:18.273 --> 48:21.985
-[sighs] You startled me.
-I see you've met Mama.

48:22.068 --> 48:23.445
This plant is your mother?

48:23.528 --> 48:28.450
No, silly. I named her after my mother,
whose name just happened to be Mama.

48:28.533 --> 48:29.534
Weird coincidence.

48:29.617 --> 48:31.619
She was also green and very controlling.

48:32.704 --> 48:37.167
Listen everyone, we came all the way
across the universe to save our sister.

48:37.250 --> 48:39.085
And we're not going home without her.

48:39.169 --> 48:42.464
If you care about your people
as much as we care about Candace,

48:42.547 --> 48:44.341
then please help us.

48:44.424 --> 48:46.593
You do not understand. All we do is cower.

48:46.676 --> 48:50.513
We are called the cowards.
In our language it means "coward."

48:50.597 --> 48:54.601
Just because you are cowards,
doesn't mean you have to be cowards.

48:54.684 --> 48:56.978
And if you can be brave just this once,

48:57.062 --> 49:00.815
from here on,
coward could mean "mighty warrior."

49:00.899 --> 49:02.108
What do you say?

49:05.695 --> 49:07.655
-But what's it for?
-It's for you.

49:07.739 --> 49:10.116
This is why we're collecting
your Remarkalonium.

49:10.200 --> 49:13.328
Check this out. Bring in the device!

49:14.120 --> 49:17.832
[ominous music playing]

49:24.589 --> 49:26.091
[music stops]

49:27.300 --> 49:28.677
Wait. Is this a treadmill?

49:28.760 --> 49:33.556
Remarkalonium is Mama's lifeblood.
She'll shrivel up and die without it.

49:33.640 --> 49:35.767
-Hop up here.
-Whoa!

49:35.850 --> 49:38.603
But thanks to you, now she can grow again

49:38.687 --> 49:41.606
and produce her wonderful
mind-controlling spores.

49:41.690 --> 49:43.817
Oh, so I'm actually doing something
environmentally friend--

49:43.900 --> 49:46.945
Wait. Mind-controlling spores?

49:47.028 --> 49:50.949
[scoffs] Yeah, how do you think
I got to be in charge in the first place?

49:51.032 --> 49:52.784
But now the spores have been wearing off.

49:52.867 --> 49:56.329
And more of the populace
is slipping from my control every day.

49:56.746 --> 49:58.707
See? There's one now.

49:59.124 --> 50:02.085
Uh, guys. We're losing another one. Guys!

50:02.752 --> 50:05.797
And... there he goes. Right out the door.

50:05.880 --> 50:08.758
Really? One of you guys
couldn't have run after him?

50:09.300 --> 50:11.094
[groans] I'm sure he hasn't gotten far.

50:11.177 --> 50:13.847
[guard] Hey, you!
You're not allowed in that shuttle craft!

50:13.930 --> 50:16.641
-You're not allowed to--
-[shuttle craft whirs, departs]

50:20.353 --> 50:21.896
-[shuttle craft crashes]
-Ha! Ha!

50:21.980 --> 50:24.399
Our shuttles are notoriously hard to fly.

50:24.482 --> 50:25.608
Bad design really.

50:25.984 --> 50:29.612
[guard] Hey! You, getting out of
that stolen shuttle, freeze!

50:29.696 --> 50:30.697
Got him now! There we--

50:30.780 --> 50:35.076
[guard] I said "freeze!" Hey! Stop! Stop!
Get away from that hover bike.

50:35.160 --> 50:38.163
-[hover bike whirs, departs]
-Get away.

50:38.246 --> 50:39.998
Any chance those are hard to fly?

50:40.081 --> 50:41.750
A child could fly it, Your Highness.

50:41.833 --> 50:44.794
[groans] Anyway... So that's why
you're so important to--

50:44.878 --> 50:45.879
What the--

50:47.630 --> 50:50.675
I thought you said a child could fly it!
Now, just how--

50:51.634 --> 50:52.844
And there he goes again.

50:53.470 --> 50:56.806
[grunts] See why I need you?
I gotta keep 'em under control.

50:56.890 --> 50:59.017
I need new episodes of Clown and Mailman.

50:59.100 --> 51:01.227
What you're doing is-- is awful.

51:01.311 --> 51:03.980
How would your brothers feel
if they could see you now?

51:04.064 --> 51:05.315
Why don't you ask 'em?

51:09.194 --> 51:12.489
Hey! You made a ball?
I told you no playing in the dungeon!

51:14.699 --> 51:17.035
[sighs] Now, let's grow some spores.

51:17.827 --> 51:20.789
Wait. Wait.
How could you imprison your own brothers?

51:20.872 --> 51:23.833
Oh, it was super easy. I lured them in
with these cheesy snacks--

51:23.917 --> 51:27.754
No, I mean, how could you? I'd never
do something like that to my brothers.

51:28.421 --> 51:30.048
-You already did.
-No, I didn't.

51:30.131 --> 51:34.803
I said, "I'll take care of 'em." And you
were like, "Would you? You're the best."

51:34.886 --> 51:37.305
So I thought you were down
with the whole dungeon thing.

51:37.389 --> 51:39.849
Wait.
You threw my brothers in the dungeon?

51:39.933 --> 51:43.520
That's not what I wanted. I love
my brothers. I never wanted to hurt them.

51:43.603 --> 51:47.273
Wow. Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.
Candy, Candy, Candy.

51:47.357 --> 51:51.361
This is eye-opening.
Have I misread things, or what?

51:51.444 --> 51:53.905
Yeah, I'd say you have. So can we-- Hey!

51:54.280 --> 51:55.615
Let me-- Let me go!

51:55.699 --> 51:57.617
I guess it was too good to be true.

51:57.701 --> 52:00.495
I thought I finally found
someone simpatico.

52:00.578 --> 52:02.664
And you even exhaled Remarkalonium.

52:02.747 --> 52:05.834
Remarkalonium? What is that anyway?
Is it even real?

52:05.917 --> 52:11.172
Of course. In your language I think
it's called "carbon dioxide." Or CO2.

52:11.256 --> 52:16.928
Wait, your rare element is carbon dioxide?
Everybody exhales carbon dioxide.

52:17.012 --> 52:20.849
Uh... we don't.
We inhale oxygen and exhale oxygen.

52:20.932 --> 52:23.935
Well, on Earth everybody exhales
carbon dioxide, genius.

52:24.019 --> 52:27.105
Hold, hold, hold up. What?

52:27.188 --> 52:29.315
Yeah. All seven billion of us.

52:29.399 --> 52:35.196
You didn't even realize I'm not--
I'm not... special.

52:35.280 --> 52:37.949
Oh. [chuckles] Oh, this is--

52:38.033 --> 52:42.537
If all you earthlings exhale
carbon dioxide, I can feed Mama forever.

52:42.620 --> 52:46.958
And I can have hundreds of castles
and smoothies and hit TV shows!

52:47.042 --> 52:49.461
Braxington-ton, Shoe-Monkey,
fire up the ship.

52:49.544 --> 52:52.130
We have an even bigger planet to conquer.

52:52.213 --> 52:55.258
-Wait. No!
-We'll load up the portable CO2 generator.

52:55.342 --> 52:57.218
-The what now?
-Her, dummy!

52:57.302 --> 52:59.220
Gotta keep Mama alive
until we get to Earth.

53:01.514 --> 53:03.016
Been a heck of a day for you, huh?

53:03.099 --> 53:06.770
Threw your brothers in jail then
threw your whole planet under the bus.

53:06.853 --> 53:09.731

Doesn't look like it.

57:47.759 --> 57:50.011
We are accelerating to warp two.

57:50.095 --> 57:52.514
Oh, my. That is twice the speed of light.

57:52.597 --> 57:55.600
Twice the speed of light?
What will that be like?

57:55.684 --> 57:57.894
I read a theory that when you exceed
the speed of light,

57:57.977 --> 58:00.313
reality, the very nature
of your existence,

58:00.397 --> 58:05.568
begins breaking down to its primal
essence, all the way back to its source.

58:05.652 --> 58:07.529
This is so weird!

58:07.612 --> 58:09.280
[temp voice]
Buford says something funny here.

58:09.364 --> 58:10.490
[Phineas] Whoa! Temp dialogue.

58:10.573 --> 58:12.909
[Baljeet] How much more
can reality break down?

58:12.992 --> 58:14.869
And then we suddenly cut to us.

58:14.953 --> 58:17.414
So, you'd actually see
Dan and I pitching this part.

58:17.497 --> 58:21.668
Right, exactly like we are now, saying
exactly what we're saying right now.

58:21.751 --> 58:24.295
And then we push back into the storyboard.

58:28.508 --> 58:30.510
We should never speak of this again.

58:30.885 --> 58:31.886
[all] Agreed.

58:34.472 --> 58:37.642
Oh, Dad, I can't believe you came
all the way here to save me.

58:37.726 --> 58:40.770
And then you saved me.
Look at you, adulting.

58:40.854 --> 58:42.188
You know that's not a verb, right?

58:42.272 --> 58:46.109
Yeah, so I've been told. But I don't know
how we're gonna get home from here.

58:46.192 --> 58:47.318
[chicken squawks]

58:49.946 --> 58:52.490
That's it!
We'll use the Chicken-Replace-Inator

58:52.574 --> 58:54.367
to switch places with a chicken on Earth!

58:54.451 --> 58:56.745
Worked like a charm earlier.
Come on! Get on!

58:56.828 --> 58:57.829

59:09.507 --> 59:10.633
Wait a second.

59:11.593 --> 59:13.303
-[chicken clucks]
-Nope, one sec.

59:15.805 --> 59:17.390
-Dad.
-Oh, I get it.

59:17.474 --> 59:21.311
The nearest chicken used to be on Earth.
Now there's one on this planet.

59:21.394 --> 59:23.396
So, it's nearer.

59:23.480 --> 59:26.066
So as long as this chicken is here,
we won't be able to--

59:26.149 --> 59:29.069
Wait a minute. Accidents can happen.

59:29.152 --> 59:31.237
Dad, we're not going to kill this chicken.

59:31.321 --> 59:32.655
[chicken clucks]

59:32.739 --> 59:33.990
So, what are we gonna do?

59:37.827 --> 59:39.079
We're almost to Earth.

59:39.162 --> 59:41.915
We've gotta find a way
to stop this ship. Now!

59:41.998 --> 59:44.250
Ooh! Ooh! I know! Space Adventure.

-[all] Baljeet!
-Sorry! We can use the shield generator

59:56.096 --> 59:59.224
to overload the main reactor and disable
the ship, stranding them in orbit.

59:59.307 --> 1:00:02.268
Then we can rescue Candace
and escape in the shuttle!

1:00:04.938 --> 1:00:06.439
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

1:00:06.523 --> 1:00:09.275
In Space Adventure,
it is always the leftmost button.

Space Adventure, you have let me down
for the last time!

1:00:30.880 --> 1:00:32.799
I don't have a patch for surviving a fall

1:00:32.882 --> 1:00:35.427
because of the false science
of a canceled TV show!

1:00:35.510 --> 1:00:38.013
Hey, I got an idea!
Everybody into the canoe!

1:00:38.805 --> 1:00:39.806
What do we do now?

1:00:39.889 --> 1:00:42.017
I don't know.
I didn't think that far ahead.

1:00:42.976 --> 1:00:48.023
Hey, we can use this debris just like
they did in Space Adventure episode 436B!

1:00:48.106 --> 1:00:49.899
-All right! Let's do it!
-Oh, yeah!

1:00:49.983 --> 1:00:54.195
Wait, Space Adventure? Why is it
a good idea when Phineas says it?

1:00:54.279 --> 1:00:55.613
It just is.

1:00:55.697 --> 1:00:56.948
Everybody grab something.

1:00:57.032 --> 1:00:58.366
Here, take this.

but the ground is getting closer.

-Oh, yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
-Yeah! Nice work! Yeah!

Look, gang, there's our house.

1:01:26.269 --> 1:01:29.522

we have a real treat for you.

1:01:59.594 --> 1:02:02.555
We will finally unveil
the recently-completed statue

1:02:02.639 --> 1:02:07.602

Isn't it spectacular, folks?

1:02:11.189 --> 1:02:15.235
This material is so delicate
it is almost impossible to sculpt with.

In fact, the first sculptor actually--

1:02:17.570 --> 1:02:19.155

Not so fast.

1:03:25.722 --> 1:03:28.975
No, really. Don't breathe so fast.
It makes her plant grow.

Yeah, lady!
Then we fell out of it by accident.

so we could come here and stop you!

It did not.

1:03:56.002 --> 1:03:58.296

to make these.

to fend off the alien invasion?

and get to Candace.

1:05:48.865 --> 1:05:51.618

Oh, wow, you are under attack.

You're a real credit to your profession.
Armed guard. Nice job.

1:05:59.834 --> 1:06:04.214
Have they-- they escaped? But how did they
make it all the way back here to Earth?

1:06:04.297 --> 1:06:07.133
Let me see what else is going on. I think
I'll check this monitor to my left.

1:06:11.721 --> 1:06:13.014
Hey, these shoes pinch.

1:06:13.098 --> 1:06:15.141
Yeah, I'd be able to create
much more carbon dioxide

1:06:15.225 --> 1:06:18.228
if you just loosened them a--
a teensy bit.

1:06:18.311 --> 1:06:19.354
Uh, I gotta let you go.

1:06:19.437 --> 1:06:21.314
All right. I'll adjust your buckle.

1:06:21.398 --> 1:06:24.442
I want you making a lot of CO2.
This is gonna get me a big promotion--

Oh, I can't believe you did this to me!

1:07:03.940 --> 1:07:05.400
I'm just so ashamed.

1:07:06.067 --> 1:07:10.321
I can't believe you guys came to save me
after all those awful things I said.

1:07:10.405 --> 1:07:16.411
After everything I've done all summer.
I've been ruining everyone's fun.

1:07:16.494 --> 1:07:17.912
What are you talking about?

1:07:17.996 --> 1:07:23.752
I'm not the Chosen One. I'm not special.
I'm not-- I'm not even a good sister.

1:07:24.294 --> 1:07:27.380
You guys--
You guys are better off without me.

1:07:30.592 --> 1:07:33.178
Candace, you need to open our gift.

1:07:33.261 --> 1:07:37.515
The gift? Oh, you were even trying to
give me a gift, and I wouldn't take it.

1:07:37.599 --> 1:07:39.100
I'm so horrible.

1:07:39.184 --> 1:07:41.478
Please, Candace. Open it.

1:07:47.817 --> 1:07:49.861
You got me a coffee mug?

1:07:49.944 --> 1:07:53.406
And I don't even drink coffee!
I can't do anything right!

1:07:53.490 --> 1:07:54.741
Push the button, Candace.

1:08:01.956 --> 1:08:04.125
Wow. What is this?

1:08:04.209 --> 1:08:07.379
It's all the things that make you
the coolest person we've ever met.

1:08:07.462 --> 1:08:11.174
You kick butt, you rock out,
and you can always make us laugh,

1:08:11.257 --> 1:08:13.635
the kind of laughter where stuff
squirts out of your nose.

1:08:13.718 --> 1:08:15.804
Summer would be no fun without you.

1:08:16.304 --> 1:08:18.890
We just wish you could see yourself
the way we see you.

1:08:18.973 --> 1:08:21.017
You may not be the Chosen One.

1:08:21.101 --> 1:08:23.687
But we'd choose you
as a sister every time.

1:08:25.605 --> 1:08:30.193
Oh, guys. I could not have chosen
better little brothers.

1:08:30.985 --> 1:08:34.906
And you know what?
I know what we're gonna do today.

Okay. We've got to figure out a way
to stop Super Super Big Doc--

Wait. Is today free T-shirt day?

Hey, Shoe-Monkey!
How 'bout a free T-shirt?

1:09:05.645 --> 1:09:07.605
Free stuff? Just like my birthday!

1:09:07.689 --> 1:09:09.482
-[squeals]
-[explosion voice] Candace!

1:09:09.566 --> 1:09:11.109
Yeah! Ew!

1:09:11.192 --> 1:09:13.445
She escaped? Get them already!

1:09:14.112 --> 1:09:17.115
You know, I used to think
the universe was against me,

1:09:17.198 --> 1:09:22.037
but now I realize...
it's me against the universe!

1:09:22.120 --> 1:09:26.207
-Us.
-It's us against the universe! Duck.

1:09:26.875 --> 1:09:29.044
-Free T-shirt?
-[explosion voice] Candace!

1:09:29.627 --> 1:09:30.879
[battle cries]

1:09:32.130 --> 1:09:33.298
Free shirt! Free shirt!

1:09:33.381 --> 1:09:34.674
-Yay.
-[explosion voice] Candace!

1:09:37.052 --> 1:09:38.053
Candace!

1:09:38.470 --> 1:09:39.471
Candace!

1:09:39.804 --> 1:09:40.805
Candace!

1:09:40.889 --> 1:09:42.140
That's my name!

1:09:42.223 --> 1:09:45.143
-Candace! Candace!
-That's my name!

1:09:45.977 --> 1:09:47.979
-Candace!
-Why does that sound like her name?

1:09:48.063 --> 1:09:49.314
I don't know.

1:09:50.315 --> 1:09:51.649
-I love it!
-Candace!

1:09:51.733 --> 1:09:53.068
[Candace shouting]

1:09:53.151 --> 1:09:54.486
Candace! Candace!

1:09:55.653 --> 1:09:56.654
Candace!

1:09:57.864 --> 1:09:59.866
Now, where's-- [groans]

1:10:00.825 --> 1:10:02.869
Nice! Now, where's--

1:10:03.536 --> 1:10:06.206
-OMG--
-Candace!

1:10:08.249 --> 1:10:10.001
And you get a shirt! And you get a shirt!

1:10:10.085 --> 1:10:11.252
-And you get a shirt!
-Candace!

1:10:11.336 --> 1:10:13.922
-And you get a shirt! And you get a shirt!
-Candace!

1:10:14.005 --> 1:10:16.591
And you get a shirt! [shouts]

1:10:17.092 --> 1:10:18.093
Candace!

1:10:19.594 --> 1:10:21.262
Candace, what about her?

1:10:23.390 --> 1:10:25.767
Oh, no! I'm all out of T-shirts.

1:10:27.644 --> 1:10:30.939
Yes! Mama is finally big enough!

1:10:36.069 --> 1:10:37.195
Gas masks, quick!

1:10:40.323 --> 1:10:41.825
[all cough]

1:10:52.085 --> 1:10:53.086
What the...

1:10:53.670 --> 1:10:54.921
Here, Stacy. Put this on.

1:10:56.047 --> 1:10:57.048
Why do you have--

1:10:57.465 --> 1:11:00.719
Jeremy, is this cosplay?
Wait, are you live action role-playing?

1:11:00.802 --> 1:11:02.887
-Are you LARPing?
-Stacy, we really have to get outta here.

1:11:02.971 --> 1:11:05.557
You're going out LARPing, aren't you?
This is LARPing stuff.

1:11:05.640 --> 1:11:06.850
We should probably get going.

1:11:06.933 --> 1:11:08.810
Have you been dressing up
as knights and elves

1:11:08.893 --> 1:11:11.104
and enacting epic battles
with foam rubber swords?

1:11:11.187 --> 1:11:12.814
[sighs] Please don't tell Candace.

1:11:12.897 --> 1:11:14.649
Well, let's get outta here, Lancelot!

1:11:14.733 --> 1:11:16.109
[groans]

1:11:17.402 --> 1:11:20.363
[chuckles] It's working!

1:11:20.447 --> 1:11:22.532
Okay now, sit down.

1:11:23.283 --> 1:11:24.367
Stand up.

1:11:25.702 --> 1:11:27.078
Get those kids!

1:11:27.162 --> 1:11:32.292
[together] Get those kids.
Get those kids Get those kids.

1:11:32.375 --> 1:11:33.626
-Get those kids.
-Run!

1:11:33.710 --> 1:11:35.295
-Get those kids.
-[crowd yelling]

1:11:37.464 --> 1:11:41.217
No! My personal space!
My personal space! [yelps]

1:11:44.095 --> 1:11:45.347
Phineas? Ferb?

1:11:45.430 --> 1:11:47.932
Yoo-hoo! Over here.

1:11:49.309 --> 1:11:52.228
You and I need to have a little talk.

1:11:53.146 --> 1:11:58.068
I'm so disappointed in you, Candy Corn.
We coulda been something.

1:11:58.151 --> 1:12:02.906
Two girls against the universe,
side by side, and you threw it away.

1:12:02.989 --> 1:12:06.743
Oh, sister, you could have been special.

1:12:06.826 --> 1:12:09.454
I'm not your sister. And I am special.

1:12:09.537 --> 1:12:11.498
-My brothers showed me that.
-[both] Aw.

1:12:11.581 --> 1:12:13.958
-Pfft, brothers.
-And you know what?

1:12:14.042 --> 1:12:17.337
Maybe you should reconsider
your relationship with your brothers too.

1:12:17.420 --> 1:12:19.381
[scoffs] Why would I do that?

1:12:19.464 --> 1:12:22.592
Think about it.
Is it possible, just possible,

1:12:22.676 --> 1:12:24.678
that this obsession you have
with controlling,

1:12:24.761 --> 1:12:27.097
controlling the planet,
controlling your brothers,

1:12:27.180 --> 1:12:30.433
is really just a distraction
from your real problem,

1:12:30.517 --> 1:12:32.727
which is how you feel about yourself?

1:12:33.853 --> 1:12:37.023
You mean like a tiny, meaningless speck
in the universe?

1:12:37.107 --> 1:12:38.608
That's good. Keep going.

1:12:38.692 --> 1:12:42.112
It's just that everyone always thought
my brothers were so special.

1:12:42.195 --> 1:12:44.364
No one paid attention to me at all.

1:12:44.447 --> 1:12:50.412
So I made myself special by controlling
everybody else. Wait a minute.

1:12:50.495 --> 1:12:54.332
This hasn't been about my brothers at all.
It's just been about my own self-worth.

1:12:54.416 --> 1:12:56.459
Wow. Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow--

1:12:56.543 --> 1:12:57.711
What a breakthrough.

1:12:57.794 --> 1:12:58.795
Wow.

1:12:58.878 --> 1:13:01.798
-I don't need to do any of this.
-Uh...

1:13:01.881 --> 1:13:04.592
Controlling all these--
Listen. Listen to me.

1:13:04.676 --> 1:13:07.303
-Yes.
-You do not have to listen to me.

1:13:07.387 --> 1:13:11.433
-I'm confused.
-I am not going to control you anymore.

1:13:11.516 --> 1:13:15.020
I was seeking validation
through the mindless obedience of others.

1:13:15.103 --> 1:13:18.273
But no more! Because I am enough!

1:13:18.356 --> 1:13:20.316
-I am spec-- [shouts]

1:13:28.992 --> 1:13:30.410
[all scream]

1:13:32.620 --> 1:13:33.747
[Candace] Whoa!

1:13:33.830 --> 1:13:35.415
[Isabella]
Well, that victory was short-lived.

1:13:35.498 --> 1:13:37.709
Run! Run. Run. It's gaining on us.

1:13:39.627 --> 1:13:41.713
-[roars]
-[screeches]

1:13:45.258 --> 1:13:46.760
-[Buford] Yeah!
-[Phineas] Vanessa.

1:13:46.843 --> 1:13:47.969
Quick. Get on!

1:13:48.053 --> 1:13:49.721
You tamed a space dragon?

1:13:49.804 --> 1:13:50.722
Her name's Vlorkel.

1:13:50.805 --> 1:13:52.349
Vlorkel. Vlorkel. Vlorkel.
Vlorkel. Vlorkel.

1:13:52.432 --> 1:13:54.726
-Well, that's disturbing.
-[Doofenshmirtz] I know, right?

1:13:55.352 --> 1:13:56.269
[Vanessa] Hold on!

1:13:59.439 --> 1:14:00.857
Wait. How did you get back to Earth?

1:14:00.940 --> 1:14:03.276
The good old Chicken-Replace-Inator. Whoa!

1:14:04.903 --> 1:14:06.279
[Candace] Chicken-Replace-Inator?

1:14:06.363 --> 1:14:09.324
You shoot something, it switches places
with the nearest chicken.

1:14:09.407 --> 1:14:11.993
Vanessa remembered it had a setting
for the furthest chicken.

1:14:12.077 --> 1:14:15.121
So we switched places with the furthest
chicken, which was here on Earth.

1:14:17.499 --> 1:14:18.667
I think we lost him.

1:14:20.627 --> 1:14:22.128
Thinking again.

1:14:23.129 --> 1:14:24.631
[Candace] Whoa, Mama!

1:14:24.714 --> 1:14:25.715
[screeches]

1:14:25.799 --> 1:14:27.592
[all shout]

1:14:35.642 --> 1:14:37.310
Hold on!

1:14:49.614 --> 1:14:50.865
Whoa!

1:14:52.283 --> 1:14:53.702
[all screaming]

1:15:06.798 --> 1:15:08.299
Oh!

1:15:13.054 --> 1:15:14.472
[screeches]

1:15:16.141 --> 1:15:17.475
Whoa! Hey, Candace!

1:15:18.059 --> 1:15:19.310
Stacy. Jeremy.

1:15:19.394 --> 1:15:21.396
[grunts] Okay. Ow.

1:15:21.479 --> 1:15:23.815
Here you go. Wait.
Is this the Chicken-Replace-Inator?

1:15:23.898 --> 1:15:26.776
Yeah. That's how we got back. We switched
places with a chicken on Earth.

1:15:26.860 --> 1:15:29.320
Hold on. Does that mean there's still
a chicken on that planet?

1:15:29.404 --> 1:15:30.572
Yeah. I guess.

1:15:31.948 --> 1:15:35.869
Grim arboreal death
if we do not stop that thing!

1:15:37.203 --> 1:15:38.580
-Cover me.
-With what?

1:15:38.663 --> 1:15:41.499
Something's about to switch places
with a chicken.

1:15:46.379 --> 1:15:48.006
[roars]

1:15:48.089 --> 1:15:49.090
[chicken clucks]

1:15:50.925 --> 1:15:52.135
[clucking]

1:15:52.218 --> 1:15:54.721
-Yeah! Great shot, Candace!
-[Buford] Yes! I love being...

1:15:58.308 --> 1:16:00.393
Why is there a petting zoo downtown?

1:16:00.477 --> 1:16:02.604
[Baljeet] Yay! My petition worked.

1:16:02.687 --> 1:16:04.773
[roars]

1:16:04.856 --> 1:16:07.233
Yeah. You gotta set it
for the furthest chicken.

1:16:07.317 --> 1:16:09.361
-What?
-Furthest chicken, Candace.

1:16:09.444 --> 1:16:11.446
[all] Furthest chicken.

1:16:15.450 --> 1:16:17.035
[roars]

1:16:19.329 --> 1:16:20.330
[chicken clucks]

1:16:22.832 --> 1:16:24.959
[all cheering]

1:16:26.711 --> 1:16:29.089
Hey look, it worked. The spores are gone.

1:16:31.466 --> 1:16:33.802
[roars]

1:16:33.885 --> 1:16:35.053
[all whimpering]

1:16:43.436 --> 1:16:47.232
Aw, Mama. At least you're not
completely destroy--

1:16:49.984 --> 1:16:51.403
Ugh. Never mind.

1:16:53.238 --> 1:16:56.408
You are under arrest. [chuckles]

1:16:56.491 --> 1:16:58.576
-Yes. You did it!
-Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

1:16:58.660 --> 1:17:00.870
Something switched places
with the chicken.

1:17:00.954 --> 1:17:02.747
[car horn honks]

1:17:04.541 --> 1:17:07.168
Candace, look. It's your mom.
This is your chance.

1:17:07.252 --> 1:17:09.254
There's no way to hide all of this.

1:17:09.337 --> 1:17:12.674
If your mom sees it, she'll know you've
been telling the truth about everything.

1:17:12.757 --> 1:17:15.635
All the busting dominoes
will finally fall.

1:17:15.719 --> 1:17:18.304
Phineas and Ferb
will be in so much trouble.

1:17:19.764 --> 1:17:22.475
Mom! Mom. Mom, Mom, Mom. Mom. Mom.

1:17:22.559 --> 1:17:24.394
Candace, what are you doing downtown?

1:17:24.477 --> 1:17:26.730
-It's Phineas and Ferb.
-What did they do now?

1:17:31.067 --> 1:17:34.279
They really want pizza for dinner but from
Giametti's. On the other side of town.

1:17:34.362 --> 1:17:36.823
So go that way. Don't come this way.
You gotta turn around.

1:17:38.783 --> 1:17:39.784
Okay.

1:17:41.703 --> 1:17:42.787
Where's Mom going?

1:17:42.871 --> 1:17:44.497
-She's getting us pizza.
-Sweet.

1:17:44.581 --> 1:17:46.499
Wait. What are you kids up to?

1:17:46.583 --> 1:17:49.127
Just the usual. Us against the universe.

1:17:49.210 --> 1:17:51.129
Okay. See you at home.

1:17:53.089 --> 1:17:56.426
You know, this morning I thought you guys
were the bane of my existence.

1:17:56.509 --> 1:18:00.055
It's amazing how an afternoon
of blasting aliens, foiling villains,

1:18:00.138 --> 1:18:03.266
