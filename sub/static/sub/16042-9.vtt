-You think I'd play on that?

04:27.160 --> 04:29.287
-I'm saying,
after everything, man.

04:29.330 --> 04:31.821
-Shit, I say let's just
dump his body off the overpass

04:31.870 --> 04:33.326
and be done with it.

04:38.450 --> 04:40.281
-Jey was your friend, man.

04:42.410 --> 04:45.447
He was your friend.
He was your friend.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.866
Jey was like blood to all 0' us.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.690

04:53.580 --> 04:55.866
at some point or another.
Ain't that right?

04:56.870 --> 04:58.246
That don't change who you was.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.821
That don't change who you is.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.406
If you stray...

05:05.500 --> 05:07.320
I'd do the same thing for you.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.536
I'd do the same thing
for all y'all.

05:14.790 --> 05:19.079
-So, what, you want the parade,
the whole nine, all that?

05:21.450 --> 05:22.826
-Put him in the ground right.

05:49.660 --> 05:51.036
-Did you see him?

05:53.330 --> 05:54.786
-Mm-hm.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.036
-So, what are we gonna do now?

06:17.450 --> 06:19.111
-When our old girls
came here...

06:20.500 --> 06:22.240
they didn't have nothing
to leave us behind.

06:25.160 --> 06:28.038
I'm gonna walk in there,
and I'm gonna sign them papers.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.690

06:42.500 --> 06:46.573

Touie and Elsie behind.

06:46.620 --> 06:50.033

Maybe we tell them.

08:31.040 --> 08:35.158

-Hi, Izzy.

08:35.160 --> 08:39.153
-Hey. What's, um--

08:39.200 --> 08:40.656
I don't know.

08:40.660 --> 08:43.447
- Who are all these people?
- I don't know.

09:00.750 --> 09:03.287
- I never ask them
how old they are.

09:03.330 --> 09:05.821
-Hey. Hi.
-Izzy. How's it going?

09:05.870 --> 09:08.031
- Good.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.822
-Why not?
-Yeah. I mean,

09:10.830 --> 09:12.570

is that all right?

09:12.660 --> 09:14.992
-Yeah.
-Yeah? Do you want some food?

09:15.040 --> 09:18.362
Huh? Got a lot of fruit.
-No, I'm okay.

09:18.450 --> 09:20.782
I'||-- I'll take some water.
-Oh, sure.

09:20.830 --> 09:22.650
-Yea h?

09:27.620 --> 09:29.611
Mm.
-Thank you.

09:34.200 --> 09:38.648
-So we've been talking, all
of us, over the last 24 hours.

09:38.700 --> 09:40.998
We're ready
to make this a reality.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.030
But the deal needs to be
with just you.

09:46.370 --> 09:48.247
Nicholas Talman
and Ronald Dacey

09:48.290 --> 09:50.861
will_claim no _
ownership to GenCom.

09:50.910 --> 09:52.491
They'll hold no stock.

09:54.040 --> 09:56.656
You never signed
anything with them, correct?

10:01.500 --> 10:04.321
-Uh, no. No, I mean--

10:04.370 --> 10:07.999
-Then it's your IP
and yours only.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.242
-Yeah, but they've--
they've been here
since the start.

10:11.290 --> 10:14.748
-Yeah, so they're nice guys,
really like them both,

10:14.790 --> 10:17.782
but... I mean,
how long would you say

10:17.830 --> 10:20.697
you've been writing this code?
Five years?

10:20.750 --> 10:23.321
Seven, if you count
those false starts.

10:23.370 --> 10:25.031
And they've been here,
what, a month?

10:25.080 --> 10:27.287
They just don't bring
anything to the table.

10:27.330 --> 10:30.367
-Yeah, we need to clear way
for partnerships

10:30.410 --> 10:32.401
that are gonna mean something
to GenCoin.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.196
And you yourself would be
a controlling partner,

10:35.250 --> 10:38.151
and board member,
along with Alex.

10:38.160 --> 10:41.448
- If you'll have me.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.195
And I'd like
to bring in one

10:43.290 --> 10:45.190
additional third-party
component.

10:45.290 --> 10:48.032
- This is Minllli' Strickland.
- I.

10:48.120 --> 10:53.240
Your code is awesome.
-Thanks.

10:53.290 --> 10:56.782

called Eden Field out of Austin.

They are one of the largest

10:58.790 --> 11:01.190
and most secure
server farms In the world.

11:01.250 --> 11:04.742
-As a partner, I'd be able to
provide you with the bandwidth

11:04.790 --> 11:07.782
and instant global reach
GenCoin would require.

11:07.830 --> 11:12.278
Yeah. I mean,
this is gonna be so huge, Izzy.

11:13.330 --> 11:14.820
You realize that.

11:14.870 --> 11:16.861
It's gonna take
off like a rocket,

11:16.910 --> 11:19.822
and we're gonna need someone
like Eden Field

11:19.870 --> 11:22.657
in order to just keep us online.

11:22.700 --> 11:26.192
Yourself,
Miss Strickland, and Mr. Bell

11:26.290 --> 11:30.283
will serve as board members
and equal shareholders.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.827
-And, uh, who--
who are they?

11:35.830 --> 11:37.821
_- Uh... _
- Busmess affairs.

11:37.910 --> 11:40.947

11:42.700 --> 11:45.362

-A team.

11:48.160 --> 11:49.400
Um...

11:51.080 --> 11:53.196
-It's a lot, I know.

11:54.250 --> 11:55.490
-Can I, um...

11:56.870 --> 12:00.909
Can I think about it
for a day? Or two?

12:01.000 --> 12:04.868
-For a number of reasons, I have
to act quickly on this.

12:04.950 --> 12:07.032
Otherwise,
I'm forced to move on.

12:08.500 --> 12:09.649
The choice is yours.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.446
-There's no way that
you can let them stay?

12:18.290 --> 12:22.693
Things would get a little
too messy, unfortunately.

12:22.750 --> 12:25.401
They'll be taken care of.
Totally compensated
for their time.

12:25.450 --> 12:29.238

12:30.750 --> 12:33.366
and place you on as one
of three board members.

12:35.950 --> 12:38.828
-If you wanna lead,
these are the tough choices
you have to make.

12:54.750 --> 12:57.822
All right.
Just a few other,
minor things.

13:09.580 --> 13:14.199
Congrats. Whoo!

13:14.250 --> 13:17.993
-Also, uh... I went ahead

13:18.040 --> 13:21.578
and arranged a little event
for tonight at my place.

13:21.660 --> 13:26.324
It's a PR thing, get the buzz
going way before launch.

13:26.330 --> 13:30.949
-Wear something nice.
It's gonna be your big

13:36.160 --> 13:38.242
- All right.
- All right!

13:38.290 --> 13:42.408
I gotta go find me an outfit.

13:53.290 --> 13:54.279
-What's up, Megan?

14:01.160 --> 14:02.320
-No one called me.

14:23.450 --> 14:25.748
Hey. Morning.

15:06.410 --> 15:07.570
-She already signed?

15:16.120 --> 15:19.112
No. It's bullshit.
I'm not signing that.

15:19.160 --> 15:22.539
- It sort of doesn't matter.
- Kinda just a formality.

15:22.580 --> 15:25.151
You had no rights
to begin with, so...

15:25.160 --> 15:26.650
it is what it is.

15:26.700 --> 15:28.327
-The office.
I paid with my own money.

15:28.330 --> 15:30.400
And we
will be paying you back,

15:30.500 --> 15:33.537

15:47.910 --> 15:52.324
-Twelve grand?
Twelve grand?

15:52.370 --> 15:54.361
-Unfortunately, I'm going
into my own pocket

15:54.410 --> 15:57.652
to repay Benedict Blush
for all the money you lost.

15:57.700 --> 16:01.329
-An investigation would
be bad... for all of us.

16:03.450 --> 16:05.998
_ It would_ be
In your best Interest
to take the deal

16:06.000 --> 16:07.536
and never look back.

16:09.250 --> 16:11.901
-Never look back? Hm?

16:12.000 --> 16:16.994
You should let us
clean up your mess and move on.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.117
I know that you are
passionate about this project.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.116
I know that you believe in it,

16:22.160 --> 16:24.822
which is why it would be best

16:24.830 --> 16:27.287

as far away as possible.

16:28.290 --> 16:29.609
For the good of GenCoin.

-Do you?

16:38.750 --> 16:41.401

be best to never look back.

16:52.160 --> 16:53.696
-I want you out of here. Okay?

16:53.750 --> 16:55.786

-Hey, Iz, look at this one.
You like it?

19:48.000 --> 19:51.652
It would look great on you.
-She looks like a hooker.

19:51.750 --> 19:53.399
And she needs to eat
a sandwich or two.

19:53.450 --> 19:55.657
-Don't look at the girl, 12,

-I didn't ask for nothing!

20:01.830 --> 20:04.367
Delfia, stop trying to make me

20:04.410 --> 20:06.651
I'm not you.

20:06.700 --> 20:08.827
-Iz, I didn't mean
to make you feel that way.
-You didn't mean--

20:08.870 --> 20:10.610
You should worry
about your wedding.

20:10.660 --> 20:12.400
Go get your snatch waxed
so you can lay there

20:12.450 --> 20:15.157
with your legs spread open,
so your boring-ass husband

20:15.200 --> 20:17.327
can jam babies into you
for the next ten years.

20:17.370 --> 20:19.531
-That's great. Thanks.

20:19.580 --> 20:22.242
-Go cry in the corner.

-Okay.

20:46.830 --> 20:49.037
--Hey, baby, can you get that?

20:54.870 --> 20:57.498
-Nick?
-Yeah. Yeah, Tamara?

20:57.500 --> 20:58.899

20:59.000 --> 21:00.536
-Oh, no, no.

21:00.580 --> 21:03.151
Thanks so much for having me.
-Of course.

21:03.160 --> 21:04.900
Heard so much about you
from Ron.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.991
-Rea|ly? Good. Good.
I brought you guys some wine.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.490
I know he doesn't drink.
I didn't know--

21:08.500 --> 21:10.195
-No, he doesn't, but I do.
-Perfect.

21:10.290 --> 21:11.826
-We can share it.
-What I was hoping.

21:11.870 --> 21:14.748
Fantastic. Smells wonderful.

21:14.790 --> 21:17.247
-Thank you.
-Yeah. Hope that's--

You met her, right?
-Yeah, she let me in.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.116
-My littlest one--
Elsie, come here.
-Elsie.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.151
-Oh, hi.
-Hi.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.327
-How you doing? I'm Nick.
-I'm Elsie.

21:33.370 --> 21:35.281
-Nice to meet you.
That's a cool scooter.

21:35.330 --> 21:36.649
-Thank you.

21:36.700 --> 21:40.033
-Okay. Whoa!
Can you do any, uh--

21:40.080 --> 21:41.490
what kind of tricks can you do?

21:54.450 --> 21:55.906
-Hey, dinner's ready.

21:58.660 --> 21:59.820
-I'm straight, Pa.

22:02.950 --> 22:04.941
-There's somebody that
I want you to meet, son.

22:10.160 --> 22:11.491
All right, well...

22:12.790 --> 22:14.610
There's some griot on the stove
if you get hungry.

22:17.500 --> 22:18.615
-A'ight, Pa.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.946
- I would _love some more.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.491
-More... griot.
-Griot.

22:33.540 --> 22:36.498
-Mm-hm.
-God, I wanna bathe in it.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.149
- Real talk.
- Fantastic, yeah.

22:38.160 --> 22:40.287
Best there is.
I'll finish it
if you guys don't.

22:40.330 --> 22:41.820
--Let me tell you something.

22:41.830 --> 22:44.151
No matter what you been through
during the day,

22:44.160 --> 22:46.071
coming home
to something like this...

22:47.410 --> 22:48.946
Damn.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.865
The world just make sense again.

22:52.250 --> 22:53.285
Thank you, baby.

22:54.290 --> 22:56.611
- Always.
- I love you.

22:57.870 --> 23:00.282
- I know.
- Come here.

23:04.200 --> 23:05.997
I love you.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.536
I'm eating!

23:07.580 --> 23:09.366
You have a guest.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.031
- Adults, right?
- Okay.

23:13.120 --> 23:15.691
We gotta get you
a nice, young Haitian girl.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.151
-I'm open to it.
I'm open to it.

23:20.250 --> 23:22.650
-Say thank you to your mama.
-Thank you, Mom.

23:22.750 --> 23:25.822
- You're welcome, baby.
- Mm. So damn good.

24:35.450 --> 24:36.690
-Hi.
-Hi, Daddy.

24:36.790 --> 24:39.031
-Hey. Hey, sweetheart.

24:39.120 --> 24:42.157
I'm sorry I'm late.
95 was a little backed up.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.906
-It's okay. Just sat down.

24:43.950 --> 24:45.406
Lost track of time
at the studio.

24:45.450 --> 24:47.247
-Oh, you been throwing?
-Yeah.

24:47.290 --> 24:48.996
Yeah, well,
we fired today, actually.
-Oh.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.992
-I did this raku glaze.
-Raku?

24:52.040 --> 24:53.655
-Yeah. Excited to see
how it comes out.

24:53.700 --> 24:56.191
-Rak-- what is that?
-It's like a glazing method.

24:56.250 --> 25:00.402
Here. Yeah. Makes, like,
a swirly, metallic pattern.

25:00.450 --> 25:01.940
It's really cool.
-Oh, neat. Neat.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.447
It's, uh, wow, look at that.
That's very cool.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.900
-Maybe I'll use it for your
birthday pot this year.

25:09.660 --> 25:10.900
-Yeah, I'd like that.

25:13.160 --> 25:16.618
-You okay?
-Mm-hm.

25:16.660 --> 25:19.037
Yeah. Yes, uh, Ijust
remembered something. Sorry.

25:19.120 --> 25:21.190
Sorry. I'm here. I'm here.
-Okay.

25:21.290 --> 25:23.781
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.072
--Getting the salmon?

25:30.120 --> 25:32.532
-Every time I come, I think I'll
do something different, but...

25:32.580 --> 25:34.366
-We don't have _to come here
every tIme.

25:34.410 --> 25:35.946
-No, I like it here.
I like it here.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.991
It's-- it's calm.

25:38.040 --> 25:40.281
-Have you talked to Mom lately?

25:40.330 --> 25:43.822
- Yep.

25:43.870 --> 25:46.191
-How's the rest of your classes?
Oh, hey, how's Kevin?

25:46.250 --> 25:49.071
You two still, uh--
oh, I'm sorry.

25:49.120 --> 25:50.997
Hey, now, I liked him.
-It's okay.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.150
We're just different people.
You know?

25:53.160 --> 25:55.651
-Excuse me?
Do I have to hit him?

25:55.700 --> 25:58.533
-No. No. He's nice.

25:58.620 --> 26:02.442
Didn't work out. Okay?
-Different people?

26:02.500 --> 26:04.821
That's awful.
Well, what are you gonna have?

26:04.870 --> 26:08.249
-Um... I'm gonna start
with the soup.

26:08.290 --> 26:10.906
-The soup.
-Yes.

26:10.950 --> 26:13.077
-The tomato soup.
-I'll see if I can get

26:13.120 --> 26:16.908
a raku glaze on my salmon.

26:16.950 --> 26:19.999
-It's good to see you.
-You too.

27:00.790 --> 27:02.940
-You look beautiful.

27:12.120 --> 27:15.658
-Izzy! Huh?

27:15.700 --> 27:18.362
You look real nice.
-Thank you.

27:18.410 --> 27:20.822
-So I know this is all
coming at you pretty fast,

27:20.870 --> 27:22.440
but I wanted to start getting
you involved

27:22.500 --> 27:24.821
as, like, the face of GenCoin.

27:24.830 --> 27:27.537
The people wanna
know the people. Right?

27:27.620 --> 27:30.942
-Yeah, so do I just--
-Just do your thing.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.649
Talk about GenCoin,
why it works,

27:32.750 --> 27:34.320
why it's important.

27:34.330 --> 27:36.116
They're gonna love you, okay?
You're brilliant.

27:36.160 --> 27:38.537
You're beautiful.
Just remember,

27:38.580 --> 27:42.243
they need you more
than you need them. Okay?

27:42.290 --> 27:43.905
-Okay.

27:45.450 --> 27:47.691
-You want a drink?
-Yeah. Yes.

27:47.750 --> 27:49.399
-Yeah, okay.
We got a full bar going.

27:49.450 --> 27:52.362
What do you drink?
-Beer, usually.

27:52.410 --> 27:55.402
-Uh, I think you need something
a little stronger.

27:55.500 --> 27:57.491
-Hm?
-Can she get some Cuervo

27:57.500 --> 27:59.570
on the rocks
for our guest of honor?

27:59.660 --> 28:02.652
Pour it deep.
Don't be shy.

28:02.660 --> 28:05.493
This is a really lovely dress.

28:06.620 --> 28:07.826
Oh.

28:07.830 --> 28:09.821
Hey. Cheers.

28:13.080 --> 28:15.401
Gabe. Come here.

28:15.450 --> 28:18.658
Perfect timing.
In the flesh, Izzy Morales.

28:18.660 --> 28:20.150
-Pleasure to meet you.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.407
Alex is a smart man,
swooping in like he did.

28:22.450 --> 28:25.192
Everyone's talking about you,
but you knew that, right?

28:25.250 --> 28:28.196
-No.
-Okay, imagine this:

28:28.250 --> 28:31.538
GenCoin launches next month.
It's avaIIable for everyone.

28:31.580 --> 28:34.037
Now, where do you see
the world in ten years?

28:34.080 --> 28:36.196
-What's your inspiration?
-For?

28:36.250 --> 28:38.070
-GenCoin._
-Have you conSIdered

28:38.160 --> 28:41.698
the ramifications
for creatIng perfect currency?

28:41.750 --> 28:43.536
-Were you actually
in development on this

28:43.580 --> 28:45.650
befo_re Bitcoin became
the uquUItous commodIty?

28:45.660 --> 28:47.196
-When do you think it
will be ready for launch?

28:47.290 --> 28:49.110
-I'm wondering about
the implications

28:49.160 --> 28:50.445
this can have on the darknet.

28:50.500 --> 28:52.650
-Tell me how you can
keep it safe.

28:52.750 --> 28:54.320
-Who was on your team?
I wanna know.

28:54.330 --> 28:55.945
Do you have any partners
behind the scenes?

28:56.000 --> 28:58.651
Are you flying solo?
Talk to us.

28:58.660 --> 29:00.651
-Uh...
-Details.

29:00.660 --> 29:02.651
-Can I take a piss real quick?

29:02.700 --> 29:05.749
-Of course.
Is she okay?

29:05.790 --> 29:08.827
Did I say something wrong?
Okay.

29:17.870 --> 29:21.692
Hey. Are you okay?

29:21.750 --> 29:23.741
-Yeah. I'm fine.

29:23.830 --> 29:26.492
I just-- I needed
a minute, you know?

29:26.500 --> 29:27.819
-It can be overwhelming.

29:27.870 --> 29:30.862
But it's part of it,
you know?

29:30.950 --> 29:32.827
-I need them back.

29:32.830 --> 29:34.900
I need my people.

29:34.950 --> 29:37.157
-Yeah. I'm sorry, Izzy--

29:37.160 --> 29:39.116
-They're my people.
I need them with me.

29:39.160 --> 29:41.446
You said it yourself,
this thing is all about people.

29:41.500 --> 29:44.071
-Right. But them, I can't.

29:44.120 --> 29:48.363
Okay? I'm sorry.
I just-- I can't.

29:48.410 --> 29:51.994
-You can. It's your money.
It's your decision.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.076
You can.
-Not really.

29:54.120 --> 29:56.031
There's just a lot
of other factors involved

29:56.080 --> 29:59.197
in decisions like that.
It's really trIcky.

30:06.660 --> 30:09.993
-You see? That's the thing.

30:10.040 --> 30:14.659
You pretend to be all
cutting-edge and progressive,

30:14.700 --> 30:17.407
asking about the why.

30:17.450 --> 30:20.578
Why, Nick? Why, Ronald?

30:20.620 --> 30:23.248
Why?

30:23.290 --> 30:26.282
You're just a corporate stooge
like the rest of em.

30:41.370 --> 30:42.826
-You know, I've been thinking.

30:42.870 --> 30:44.656
I think you've been
overlooking the value

30:44.700 --> 30:47.157
of a company based
in ideology right now.

30:47.160 --> 30:50.618
If you set
out to make it about people...

30:50.660 --> 30:53.117
if common human values
are your measurIng stIck...

30:53.160 --> 30:56.288
and not profit, the only
thing that could undo us

30:56.330 --> 30:59.072
is succumbing
to the same misguided values

30:59.120 --> 31:00.405
that this country was built on.

31:00.450 --> 31:01.906
Greed. Ego.

31:01.950 --> 31:03.281
You should
be writing all this down.

31:03.330 --> 31:04.445
Three tequila shots, please.

31:04.500 --> 31:05.990
That's why I surround myself

31:06.000 --> 31:08.992
with people
that understand common values,

31:09.040 --> 31:11.361
like Ronald Dacey,
Nick Talman.

31:11.410 --> 31:13.537
They're the real heroes
of GenCoin.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.616
They showed me its true place
in this world.

31:15.660 --> 31:16.786
-His last name again?
-Dacey.

31:16.830 --> 31:20.948
-Uh-huh.
-D-A-C-E-Y.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.150
Talman. T-A-L...

31:23.160 --> 31:25.867
M-A-N.

31:25.910 --> 31:27.195
-Wow! You're the best!

31:27.250 --> 31:28.990
-There's no GenCoin
without them.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.365
-Thank you.

31:31.700 --> 31:34.442
-I'll take this.

31:53.830 --> 31:56.196
-Hey, uh...

31:56.250 --> 31:59.287
just two minutes.
Please, two and a half years,

31:59.330 --> 32:02.618
all I'm asking for
is two minutes.

32:13.700 --> 32:16.612
-Uh...

32:16.660 --> 32:19.151
I really, really messed up.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.651
I'm really, really sorry.

32:26.580 --> 32:29.652
I can't even believe we're
haVIng thIs conversatIon.

32:29.700 --> 32:32.999
I can't believe
it got so bad so fast.

32:37.290 --> 32:38.405
Look”.

32:40.080 --> 32:41.695
I lied to you.

32:43.040 --> 32:45.110
And I'm so sorry.

32:45.160 --> 32:47.401
And this isn't an excuse
at all.

32:47.500 --> 32:50.572
I-- it was just one
of those things

32:50.660 --> 32:53.072
where it started
as somethIng very small.

32:53.160 --> 32:54.821
And I was trying
to do something good.

32:54.830 --> 32:56.320
-For who?
-And it--

32:56.370 --> 32:57.860
what do you mean?

32:58.870 --> 33:00.781
-Who was it good for?

33:03.120 --> 33:04.246
-I...

33:05.500 --> 33:07.320
I still don't think
you understand

33:07.330 --> 33:08.740
what GenCoin is about.

33:08.790 --> 33:10.496
-Do you, Nick?

33:13.790 --> 33:18.033
You took drug money.
You committed fraud.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.617
I mean, you're hanging out
with a gangster.

33:20.660 --> 33:22.537
Jesus Christ!

33:26.200 --> 33:27.690
I mean, have you hurt people?

33:27.750 --> 33:30.822
-Have I what?
-Just answer the question.

33:30.830 --> 33:33.537
Have you hurt anybody?
I don't know--

33:33.580 --> 33:35.866
-What do you mean?
Have I--

33:35.910 --> 33:39.323
Have I hurt anyone? What?

33:39.330 --> 33:41.491
-I don't know!
What am I supposed to think?

33:41.540 --> 33:43.826
-No-- I don't know!
Not that!

33:43.870 --> 33:45.497
What are you talking about?
You don't...

33:45.500 --> 33:48.321
you-- do you really-- okay.

33:48.330 --> 33:51.618
I'm sorry. Do you really think
I would do something like that?

33:51.660 --> 33:54.322
-I don't know.
Honestly, I don't know.

33:54.370 --> 33:55.997
No, I didn't before.
The person that...

33:56.040 --> 33:57.905
-Taylor!
-...that I knew! But no--

33:57.950 --> 33:59.827
-You know me.
What are you talking about?

33:59.870 --> 34:01.610
-I don't know you!
I don't know you because, Nick,

34:01.660 --> 34:04.788
I don't, okay? I--
I don't know you.

34:04.830 --> 34:07.287
Okay? Because you
don't even know you.

34:08.750 --> 34:10.866
You lie to yourself.

34:10.910 --> 34:16.075
You like to pretend you're
this-- this do-gooder,

34:16.160 --> 34:18.287
okay, with your
micro-financing bullshit,

34:18.330 --> 34:20.821
and you quit your job.
-Hey.

34:20.870 --> 34:23.441
Hey, you wouldn't have let me
ifI told you. Okay?

34:23.500 --> 34:25.149
-Oh, really?
-Yeah! That's absolutely right!

34:25.200 --> 34:27.498
You and your dad--
maybe if you would just

34:27.580 --> 34:29.320
have let me be
who I wanted to be!

34:29.410 --> 34:30.991
-What? What?
-No, I'm not kidding!

34:31.000 --> 34:33.651
I'm not kidding!
You guys...

34:33.660 --> 34:37.824
you looked at me like
I was some irreverent hippie

34:37.870 --> 34:41.863
who didn't give a shit
about family or about--

34:41.910 --> 34:44.652
about providing because
I didn't want a Porsche,

34:44.700 --> 34:47.032
or I didn't want to chat
about real estate,

34:47.080 --> 34:49.446
or I didn't wanna
suck off my rich friends

34:49.500 --> 34:52.537
so I could climb the ladder
and wave my dick

34:52.580 --> 34:55.151
from the fucking top
of my big mansion,

34:55.160 --> 34:57.537
because I'm very proud
that I can spend

34:57.580 --> 35:01.289
$200,000 on my kid's
fucking bat mitzvah.

35:01.330 --> 35:04.288
So... fucking great.

35:07.500 --> 35:10.492
-Wow.
-I'm sorry.

35:10.500 --> 35:13.116
-Wow.
-Taylor... hey.

35:13.160 --> 35:15.116
-Just stop. Just-- please.
-No.

35:15.160 --> 35:16.491
-Please, just stop talking.

35:16.540 --> 35:17.859
Just leave me alone
for a second.

35:19.830 --> 35:22.401
-Goddamn it!
What am I supposed to say

35:22.450 --> 35:24.657
when you start acting
like I'm a violent person?

35:24.700 --> 35:27.077
-What are you supposed to say?
You are supposed to say,

35:27.120 --> 35:30.192
"I'm sorry,"
and then shut the fuck up!

35:33.160 --> 35:35.742
You are not supposed
to make this all about you.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.821
I mean, you know what
really sucks?

35:41.870 --> 35:43.690
When--

35:43.790 --> 35:45.496
When I first fell
in love with you,

35:45.500 --> 35:47.320
when I really knew
for the first time

35:47.370 --> 35:48.826
that I wanted to be with you,
I mean,

35:48.870 --> 35:50.576
there were all those
other guys there, okay?

35:50.620 --> 35:52.611
All those other douchebags.
And then I met you,

35:52.660 --> 35:54.150
and I just knew it.

35:54.160 --> 35:55.741
Okay, you were different.

35:57.950 --> 35:59.497
And I respected that.

35:59.540 --> 36:02.191
Okay, I respected your passion.

36:02.250 --> 36:04.445
I respected your integrity.

36:07.370 --> 36:09.941
And, by the way,
so did my dad. Okay?

36:10.000 --> 36:12.241
My dad's always liked you,
and I don't really give a shit

36:12.290 --> 36:15.532
what notion you've put on him
or what notion you put on me

36:15.580 --> 36:17.195
about the way that we
look at you,

36:17.250 --> 36:19.571
because it's not true. Okay?
It's not true!

36:19.660 --> 36:22.037
It is all in your head,
and it's not fair.

36:23.500 --> 36:26.446
That is your issue.
That is your self pity.

36:26.500 --> 36:28.445
That is your insecurity.

36:44.500 --> 36:46.036
I don't even know what...

36:49.790 --> 36:52.327
I thought I knew you. Well...

36:55.500 --> 36:57.036
I used to know you.

36:58.080 --> 37:00.071
The guy that you used to be.

37:02.200 --> 37:03.827
And I loved that guy.

37:06.330 --> 37:07.490
But this...

37:08.700 --> 37:11.157
This guy standing
in front of me?

37:14.330 --> 37:16.616
I just don't know you.

37:16.660 --> 37:19.322
-I'm a better person now.
That's who I am.

37:20.910 --> 37:23.117
-Rea|ly?
-Yeah. Yeah.

37:23.160 --> 37:25.537
That guy you're talking about,
I hate his guts.

37:28.830 --> 37:30.536
-Well, that's really
a shame, Nick.

37:30.580 --> 37:33.617
Because that's the person
that I want to be with.

39:11.370 --> 39:14.328
It'll be ready by the end
of this week.

39:17.120 --> 39:19.076
That's cold,
let me make you some more.

39:19.120 --> 39:20.940
- It's good.
- It's cold!

39:21.000 --> 39:22.490
-Hey, hey, you're going
into your office today?

39:22.580 --> 39:24.491
-I'll be back.
-But your sister's getting

39:24.580 --> 39:27.447
married tomorrow!
-Mom, it's a half day.

39:27.500 --> 39:29.616
-Bring that mug back.

39:55.500 --> 39:57.491
-Megan. Who has the key to this?

39:58.660 --> 40:01.402
Megan. What's this?
Who has the key?

40:03.120 --> 40:05.827
Megan! Megan.

40:10.870 --> 40:12.030
Megan!

40:15.830 --> 40:17.240
Megan.

40:23.660 --> 40:26.151
Hey! You have the key to this?

40:26.200 --> 40:28.156
-Sorry, Izzy.
-Sorry what? Megan.

40:28.160 --> 40:29.741
Come open the gate!
-Um...

40:29.830 --> 40:32.367
-Use the key! Megan!
-I don't know what to do.

40:32.410 --> 40:34.366
-I'm your boss!
I hired you!
-No. I--

40:34.450 --> 40:36.156
-Megan.
-Um, you never paid me.

40:36.200 --> 40:38.828
-I never paid you?
Megan, you were an intern!

40:38.830 --> 40:41.651
-I'm an intern.
-Open the gate! Megan!

40:41.660 --> 40:44.117
Megan, why?
-I'm not supposed
to open the gate.

40:44.160 --> 40:46.492
-Yeah, who told you you're not
supposed to open the gate? Alex?

40:46.500 --> 40:49.617
Alex! Alex!
-Hey.Shh!

40:49.660 --> 40:51.901
Please calm down.
-Calm down?

40:51.950 --> 40:54.657
It's my company!
Megan, open the fucking gate!
-You don't need to swear.

40:54.700 --> 40:56.861
-I don't need to--
open the fucking gate, Megan!

40:56.910 --> 40:59.572
Open the gate!
Open the gate. Hey, hey. Hey!

40:59.620 --> 41:01.190
- Come here. Come here.
- Don't talk to her.

41:01.250 --> 41:02.740
-You have the key to this?

41:02.790 --> 41:04.860
-Don't give her the key.
-No? "Don't give her the key"?

41:04.910 --> 41:06.992
Alex! Vera!

41:07.000 --> 41:09.992
Open this gate!
I will break it down!

41:10.000 --> 41:11.865
Open the gate!
I'll break this fucker down!

41:11.910 --> 41:13.741
- Megan!
- I'm calling security.

41:13.830 --> 41:15.821
-Call security!
You guys are all here

41:15.870 --> 41:18.862
'cause of me!
This is my company!

41:28.160 --> 41:31.573
- Tear it up in my hands

41:31.620 --> 41:34.441
Blow it into the wind

41:36.950 --> 41:39.942
A thousand times
did I pray

41:40.000 --> 41:43.822
Now I'm walking away

41:45.200 --> 41:47.691
'Cause the sun is gone

41:47.750 --> 41:48.819
It's gone

41:48.830 --> 41:51.697
Oh, it's gone

41:53.830 --> 41:56.196
Yeah, it's gone,
it's gone

41:56.250 --> 42:01.119
It's gone,
hey, it's gone

42:07.790 --> 42:10.827
Rope silver and white

42:10.910 --> 42:13.322
Bathed in the light

42:13.330 --> 42:15.992
Down at the river

42:16.040 --> 42:19.612
There's angels singing
my song

42:19.660 --> 42:22.402
Showing me a new dawn

42:22.450 --> 42:25.613
A new dawn

42:28.750 --> 42:31.150
Yeah

42:32.500 --> 42:35.492
Yeah, it's gone,
it's gone

42:35.540 --> 42:40.364
It's gone,
hey, it's gone away

42:40.450 --> 42:43.157
Yeah, it's gone

42:43.160 --> 42:49.156
It's gone, it's gone,
hey, it's gone away
