03:54.040 --> 03:55.831
The guy's been shot, Jesse.

03:55.958 --> 03:57.536
-You found him?
-Yeah.

03:57.668 --> 04:00.076
I'm on the 11:00 to 7:00.

04:00.296 --> 04:03.416
I pulled over to take a leak and saw the dog.

04:07.762 --> 04:09.090
Don't know him.

04:09.222 --> 04:11.926
His wallet and licence are still in his pocket.

04:12.058 --> 04:13.303
Kenneth Eisley.

04:14.101 --> 04:16.427
Big house on the other side of the water.

04:16.562 --> 04:19.017
Another commuter who moved here
looking for paradise.

04:19.148 --> 04:20.726
Well, he found it.

04:22.985 --> 04:24.396
Looks like . 22s.

04:25.363 --> 04:27.688
lt's a murder, isn't it, Jesse?

04:28.866 --> 04:30.029
Probably.

04:31.786 --> 04:34.324
Do you think the tide washed him up here?

04:35.873 --> 04:39.741
A body that's been in the ocean and
washed up on shore doesn't look like that.

04:39.877 --> 04:41.585
-More beat-up.
-Yep.

04:42.296 --> 04:45.630
-He's got some marks on his face.
-That would be the gulls.

04:46.425 --> 04:48.881
I could have lived without knowing that.

04:49.178 --> 04:51.586
-What about shell casings?
-No.

04:52.181 --> 04:55.266
-Maybe the killer picked them up.
-Or used a revolver.

04:57.603 --> 05:00.177
Anthony said on the phone
we got a murder?

05:00.314 --> 05:04.394
You're the crime scene guy, Doc,
but there's two bullet holes in his chest.

05:04.527 --> 05:06.187
That'll be a clue.

05:07.905 --> 05:11.072
-He's not in rigor yet.
-What does that mean?

05:11.200 --> 05:13.608
He ran into his killer
less than two hours ago.

05:13.744 --> 05:15.025
Or killers.

05:15.955 --> 05:17.698
D'Angelo, close the area.

05:18.040 --> 05:20.828
lt's November, Skipper.
Nobody uses it anyway.

05:21.836 --> 05:22.998
This guy did.

05:25.506 --> 05:28.460
What about the dog? He's just sitting there.

06:18.601 --> 06:20.225
Jesse, it's Jenn.

06:21.354 --> 06:22.848
Are you there?

06:23.940 --> 06:27.854
lt's late.
Guess you're asleep or out on a date.

06:30.196 --> 06:33.612
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to sound like that.
I've had a long day.

06:33.741 --> 06:35.983
I was pointing to Teaneck, New Jersey...

06:36.118 --> 06:38.823
when I was giving the forecast
for Long lsland.

06:39.747 --> 06:43.792
Actually, it didn't matter.
Weather girls aren't taken seriously, anyway.

06:44.335 --> 06:46.375
Then I was out all night until now...

06:46.504 --> 06:49.873
and the network had this fundraising thing
over at the Met...

06:50.007 --> 06:52.712
and Craig, my segment producer, took me.

06:53.010 --> 06:55.252
Anyway, I'm beat. I'm gonna crash.

06:55.555 --> 06:57.547
I guess I'll talk to you....

06:58.599 --> 07:00.343
...seriously, anyway.

07:00.768 --> 07:02.761
Then I was out all night until now...

07:02.895 --> 07:06.311
and the network had this fundraising thing
over at the Met...

07:06.440 --> 07:09.228
and Craig, my segment producer, took me.

07:09.360 --> 07:11.732
Anyway, I'm beat. I'm gonna crash.

07:11.863 --> 07:13.985
I guess I'll talk to you tomorrow.

07:26.794 --> 07:27.909
Hey.

07:29.547 --> 07:32.417
lt's 7:00 in the morning.
What are you doing here?

07:32.550 --> 07:34.673
I'm up early, fighting crime.

07:35.469 --> 07:38.506
-Can you come over tonight?
-I'd be foolish not to.

07:38.639 --> 07:40.762
-We can order in.
-Chinese?

07:40.892 --> 07:43.430
Because you know how erotic I get
when I eat Chinese.

07:43.561 --> 07:45.221
Or when you don't.

07:52.320 --> 07:55.155
Age: 37. Divorced, no children.

07:55.281 --> 07:58.448
His parents live in Amherst.
They've been notified.

07:59.327 --> 08:01.948
Somebody killed him
and they had to have a reason.

08:02.079 --> 08:03.574
Talk with the people he worked with.

08:03.706 --> 08:06.624
Perkins said he'd get to Eisley's autopsy
around lunchtime, Skipper.

08:06.751 --> 08:08.708
D'Angelo, in all the years I've been a cop...

08:08.836 --> 08:12.003
I have never heard the police chief
referred to as "Skipper. "

08:12.131 --> 08:15.215
Chief, there's a couple here
with their daughter. The Penningtons.

08:15.343 --> 08:17.668
-What do they want?
-They didn't want to say...

08:17.803 --> 08:20.129
but I think you need to talk with them.

08:20.723 --> 08:24.507
Call Capt. Healey. Tell him we're sending
the bullets down for ballistics.

08:24.644 --> 08:25.806
Right.

08:26.979 --> 08:29.351
Good morning, folks. I'm Chief Stone.

08:30.274 --> 08:31.816
Please sit down.

08:37.740 --> 08:40.065
-My daughter has been raped.
-Mother!

08:40.201 --> 08:42.692
Molly, you might want to stick around.

08:43.703 --> 08:46.242
-l didn't get raped.
-Please, honey.

08:47.416 --> 08:50.868
She came home late last night.
She tried to slip into the house.

08:51.003 --> 08:54.835
Her jeans were ripped, her hair was a mess,
her lip was bleeding.

08:54.966 --> 08:57.504
I insisted on inspecting her myself.

08:58.177 --> 09:01.380
She had on no underwear
and her thighs were bruised.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.763
Did you take her to the doctor?

09:04.892 --> 09:06.801
And have it all over town? God, no.

09:06.936 --> 09:09.225
I cleaned her up
and brought her straight to you.

09:09.355 --> 09:11.395
Cleaned her up? How?

09:13.067 --> 09:16.851
I put her in a hot bath and scrubbed her
myself, like she was 2 years old.

09:16.988 --> 09:19.027
Who did this to you, Candace?

09:19.156 --> 09:22.360
-l don't want to talk about it.
-You tell them, young lady.

09:22.493 --> 09:27.036
Candace, if we don't know who did it,
it might happen again...

09:27.832 --> 09:30.038
to somebody else or to you.

09:31.836 --> 09:35.086
-Tell the Chief what happened right now.
-No hitting.

09:37.633 --> 09:39.626
Molly, take Candace outside.

09:43.097 --> 09:44.971
Come with me, Candace.

09:52.190 --> 09:54.229
lsn't there some kind of a test?

09:54.358 --> 09:57.562
A hot bath tends to wash away
that kind of evidence...

09:57.695 --> 10:01.146
-but the hospital might be able to tell us--
-No, I won't take her.

10:01.282 --> 10:02.480
Margaret.

10:05.244 --> 10:08.530
This incident must remain confidential.
Can you promise me that?

10:08.664 --> 10:09.862
Of course not.

10:10.041 --> 10:14.335
We don't plan to blab about it.
But if there's a trial, people will find out.

10:14.837 --> 10:16.545
We can't discuss this any further.

10:16.672 --> 10:19.377
I want my daughter,
and we're going home now.

10:25.765 --> 10:27.389
I've said what I have to say.

10:27.517 --> 10:31.466
-Mrs. Pennington, why don't you let us--
-l have nothing to say to you.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.516
Anything you want to tell me?

10:52.458 --> 10:54.451
Poor kid. What are we gonna do?

10:54.585 --> 10:57.207
You heard her mother.
She doesn't want a scandal.

10:57.338 --> 10:59.247
So we're not gonna do anything?

10:59.382 --> 11:02.667
I didn't say that.
Why don't you go down to the high school?

11:02.802 --> 11:05.044
-And do what?
-Keep an eye on her.

11:05.179 --> 11:07.504
-Find out who did this.
-How?

11:08.641 --> 11:10.301
You'll think of something.

11:43.009 --> 11:44.966
-Am I late?
-No.

11:45.303 --> 11:47.461
You can't invite someone over for dinner...

11:47.597 --> 11:49.673
and just plunk down cartons of food
on the table.

11:49.807 --> 11:52.512
Of course you can't.
I just wanted to see if you knew that.

11:52.643 --> 11:53.924
Yeah, right.

12:02.320 --> 12:04.526
-There's a dog in here.
-Yeah.

12:52.245 --> 12:53.703
Where are you going?

12:56.749 --> 12:58.374
Do you want water?

13:00.503 --> 13:01.582
Wine.

13:29.073 --> 13:30.982
The floor's gotten cold.

13:31.784 --> 13:33.575
The season's over.

13:42.044 --> 13:43.455
I'm worried.

13:45.506 --> 13:47.463
Someone will find him.

13:47.758 --> 13:49.965
I just couldn't kill a dog.

13:52.013 --> 13:53.970
Let it go. Let's go, Reggie.

13:56.058 --> 13:57.553
Go, boy. Ready?

13:59.645 --> 14:01.437
-You ever met him?
-Who?

14:02.648 --> 14:05.768
-The baseball player on your wall.
-Ozzie? No.

14:06.527 --> 14:09.197
But he was the best shortstop I ever saw.

14:09.322 --> 14:11.860
Would you have been that good
if you hadn't been hurt?

14:11.991 --> 14:15.407
I might have made the show,
but I wouldn't have been Ozzie.

14:17.038 --> 14:18.448
Do you miss it?

14:20.374 --> 14:21.655
Every day.

14:25.963 --> 14:28.205
Why do you think we get along?

14:29.091 --> 14:30.467
I don't know.

14:31.177 --> 14:34.047
We're an odd pair. I'm way too old for you.

14:35.014 --> 14:37.386
So why do you think we get along?

14:38.851 --> 14:42.469
-Because we're pals.
-Pals that have sex.

14:45.233 --> 14:46.775
You're like me.

14:46.901 --> 14:49.855
You won't commit to a relationship
just to have it.

14:50.154 --> 14:53.357
Neither one of us requires a commitment
from the other.

14:53.491 --> 14:56.575
Which produces a kind of commitment
to each other.

14:58.579 --> 15:01.201
I don't mean this in any negative way...

15:01.332 --> 15:04.286
but you may be the simplest person
I've ever met.

15:05.127 --> 15:09.588
You know what you know, you do
what you do, and you just keep doing it.

15:10.383 --> 15:13.337
-Like a mule.
-Or a jackass.

15:18.724 --> 15:21.180
One shot, straight through the heart.

15:21.310 --> 15:23.184
The other clipped the descending aorta.

15:23.646 --> 15:25.971
You want all the details
about what got penetrated?

15:26.107 --> 15:27.649
I'll read the report.

15:37.159 --> 15:41.288
Looks like 40 grain, standard velocity,
$10-a-brick ammunition.

15:41.414 --> 15:43.038
Almost like a pro.

15:43.165 --> 15:46.119
Shots entered the body
about 30 degrees apart.

15:46.252 --> 15:47.876
What's that mean to you?

15:47.877 --> 15:50.673
I don't know, Jess.
I'm a paediatrician most of the time.

15:50.798 --> 15:53.206
This is the first murder I've seen.

15:53.384 --> 15:56.219
You must have seen
lots of stuff like this in LA.

15:56.429 --> 15:59.964
lt could mean that the victim moved
after the first shot hit him.

16:00.099 --> 16:02.056
Or one shooter with two guns.

16:02.185 --> 16:05.351
Or two shots at the same time
from two shooters.

16:05.771 --> 16:08.523
We should pull
all the city and state firearm records.

16:08.649 --> 16:10.938
Good luck.
Everyone in the state owns a . 22.

16:11.068 --> 16:13.738
We could cross-reference
for people who live in and around--

16:13.863 --> 16:17.148
lf it was bought in Massachusetts,
if the gun store did its paperwork...

16:17.283 --> 16:21.067
if we didn't lose it in the computer,
and if they live in Paradise.

16:21.787 --> 16:23.531
We've got him cornered.

16:25.791 --> 16:28.911
-What, so we shouldn't?
-No, go ahead. We have to.

16:29.503 --> 16:32.955
But smart criminals
don't use registered guns to commit murder.

16:33.090 --> 16:36.008
-You think he's smart?
-He or she.

16:56.322 --> 16:57.982
Hey, Pennington.

16:59.325 --> 17:00.867
What? No hello?

17:02.537 --> 17:05.952
You see these? Don't you say a thing.

17:07.916 --> 17:10.075
Actually, that's my favourite.

17:20.221 --> 17:22.593
You say anything and you're dead.

17:40.954 --> 17:43.243
Listen, I'll have to call you back.

17:43.374 --> 17:46.458
Does that translate to, "I've lD'd the rapist"?

17:46.835 --> 17:50.039
-There's a dog in here.
-Witness protection.

17:52.966 --> 17:54.626
Bo Marino.

17:55.427 --> 17:59.010
-The football player.
-Football star and two of his teammates.

17:59.139 --> 18:02.176
Bo showed something to Candace
that scared the hell out of her.

18:02.309 --> 18:06.639
-You know who the boys were with Marino?
-Kevin Feeney and Troy Drake.

18:07.356 --> 18:09.681
-You got anything else?
-Not yet.

18:09.817 --> 18:11.311
You got a plan?

18:12.361 --> 18:14.188
I'm going to haunt them.

18:14.321 --> 18:17.275
-You have to work here some time.
-My time.

18:17.866 --> 18:21.615
-lt's company time, too. Company business.
-lt's women's business.

18:22.830 --> 18:24.621
Men may know things women don't.

18:24.748 --> 18:27.619
Yes, but rape is one of the things we know.

18:28.377 --> 18:30.453
So I'm going to haunt them.

18:42.558 --> 18:44.218
Don't lean so close....

18:45.978 --> 18:47.353
Higher!

18:57.489 --> 18:59.945
-Are you done with your paper?
-Yeah, you can have it.

19:00.075 --> 19:02.531
-Thanks so much.
-Yeah, just keep it.

19:06.415 --> 19:10.460
-See something you like?
-Yes. Take a look at this.

19:20.596 --> 19:23.597
-l didn't know you were shooting this.
-I'm always shooting.

19:23.724 --> 19:26.297
But ljust wanted to read it.

19:26.435 --> 19:28.013
She's the one.

19:28.729 --> 19:30.223
She was nice.

19:31.398 --> 19:33.557
She wanted to borrow my paper.

19:34.735 --> 19:38.400
-You think she's good-looking?
-l think she's great-looking.

19:38.739 --> 19:40.613
-Well, see you later.
-Thanks.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.402
She looks kind of horsy to me.

19:50.292 --> 19:51.834
She's the one.

19:52.961 --> 19:56.461
How does it make you feel
that she's sleeping with other men?

19:56.590 --> 20:00.255
-She has every right.
-But how does it make you feel?

20:02.638 --> 20:05.555
lt makes me want to kill
every man she's with.

20:06.058 --> 20:07.552
But you don't.

20:07.685 --> 20:09.476
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

20:12.064 --> 20:14.851
You know that I'm a wiser person than you.

20:16.193 --> 20:19.028
Which gives you the right
to offer me advice.

20:19.154 --> 20:20.981
Yes. lt's a rule.

20:22.992 --> 20:27.784
Jesse, you've been divorced now for what,
five years?

20:28.414 --> 20:31.948
-And you advise me to forget about Jenn?
-l do.

20:33.460 --> 20:35.951
-ls anyone advising you otherwise?
-No.

20:37.339 --> 20:39.913
lf you could resolve this thing with Jenn...

20:40.050 --> 20:43.300
then maybe you could put
this drinking thing behind you, too...

20:43.429 --> 20:46.880
and just be a really good police chief.

20:48.642 --> 20:50.599
I've never been drunk on the job.

20:50.728 --> 20:53.266
You have never been drunk on the job here.

20:55.482 --> 20:56.941
Good point.

20:58.319 --> 20:59.943
-So?
-So?

21:03.615 --> 21:05.525
Are you suggesting that I shut up?

21:05.659 --> 21:08.660
No. Your advice is good.

21:10.331 --> 21:12.288
lt's just not good for me.

21:35.481 --> 21:37.723
Nobody's touched the body.

21:42.946 --> 21:44.489
Who was she?

21:44.907 --> 21:47.480
Her driver's licence says Barbara Carey.

21:54.958 --> 21:57.165
Notice she got shot, just like the last guy.

21:57.294 --> 21:59.999
-Yeah, I noticed.
-Thought I'd mention it.

22:02.216 --> 22:05.501
D'Angelo, I want pictures of all the cars
in the parking lot...

22:05.636 --> 22:07.628
licence plates so we can read them.

22:07.763 --> 22:09.008
-All of them?
-Yeah.

22:09.139 --> 22:11.179
Who's going to pay for the film?

22:12.726 --> 22:13.889
I will.

22:16.397 --> 22:19.314
-You think the killer's still here?
-Would you be?

22:23.737 --> 22:25.196
You okay?

22:27.992 --> 22:29.569
He's interesting.

22:30.911 --> 22:32.536
I didn't notice.

22:34.123 --> 22:35.866
They're taking down licence plates.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.992
-They'll find our names.
-So?

22:38.127 --> 22:40.748
They'll find a lot of other names, too.

22:41.130 --> 22:43.881
You think they'll bring us in
for questioning?

22:44.133 --> 22:45.924
Small-town force.

22:46.427 --> 22:48.799
I don't think they've got the manpower.

22:49.305 --> 22:52.305
lt might be kind of exciting if they did.

23:04.945 --> 23:07.732
-You need a ride?
-What do you want?

23:08.073 --> 23:09.236
To talk.

23:25.591 --> 23:29.968
lf you want to slump down so nobody
sees you, I won't take it personally.

23:34.308 --> 23:35.767
There's a dog here.

23:37.561 --> 23:39.055
What's his name?

23:39.938 --> 23:43.639
-What do you think his name is?
-Reggie?

23:45.235 --> 23:47.608
You think he looks like a Reggie?

23:47.988 --> 23:49.981
lt's what it says on his collar.

24:26.902 --> 24:30.105
Bo Marino, Kevin Feeney, and Troy Drake.

24:32.324 --> 24:34.400
We both know they raped you.

24:35.369 --> 24:38.323
And we both know they threatened you
about telling.

24:40.666 --> 24:43.999
-How do you know?
-I'm the police chief. I know everything.

24:48.257 --> 24:49.585
lf you let them...

24:49.717 --> 24:54.046
they will make your life miserable
for as long as you live in this town.

24:54.805 --> 24:58.221
lf you tell me about it,
I can give you your life back.

25:00.728 --> 25:03.978
-My mother is....
-l can help you with your mother.

25:08.861 --> 25:10.818
I want you to call me...

25:11.363 --> 25:14.530
any time, about anything.

25:17.369 --> 25:19.409
This will be just between you and me...

25:19.538 --> 25:22.076
until you say otherwise. lt's our secret.

25:25.169 --> 25:26.627
What are you going to do?

25:26.754 --> 25:28.545
I'm going to haunt them.

25:31.216 --> 25:33.589
-You won't tell?
-No.

25:42.019 --> 25:45.470
But we're in this together, okay?

25:49.193 --> 25:50.687
Okay.

26:21.486 --> 26:24.190
-How come you're not in uniform?
-Casual Tuesday.

26:24.322 --> 26:27.073
-Skip Wilder, Boston Herald.
-No comment.

26:32.747 --> 26:35.748
You came all the way up from Boston
to pick up two bullets?

26:35.875 --> 26:37.998
I came to see
if I could be of some assistance.

26:42.173 --> 26:43.418
I didn't bring him.

26:43.549 --> 26:46.883
Find out if he drives a black BMW.
One was following me around.

26:48.012 --> 26:49.969
Did you get the licence number, Skipper?

26:58.606 --> 27:01.393
-You heard?
-I heard.

27:01.567 --> 27:03.560
-Same m. o. ?
-Same m. o.

27:04.112 --> 27:05.522
No obvious motive?

27:06.072 --> 27:08.148
I think it might be random.

27:14.080 --> 27:16.915
I'm the State Homicide Commander.
I'm not God.

27:17.041 --> 27:20.790
-l thought they were the same thing.
-Think how disappointed I am.

27:21.587 --> 27:23.247
lt could be a long process.

27:23.381 --> 27:27.425
The sooner we confirm it, the sooner
we'll have the national media on us.

27:29.137 --> 27:31.343
The process just got longer.

27:31.931 --> 27:33.094
Thanks.

27:34.392 --> 27:35.554
Suit?

27:37.392 --> 27:40.900
Write me up a paper for the local paper
about how we have this all under control?

27:41.566 --> 27:43.807
-Me?
-Yeah, you're good at that.

27:44.318 --> 27:45.813
-l am?
-Yeah.

27:46.070 --> 27:47.648
-Do we?
-What?

27:47.780 --> 27:49.654
Have it all under control.

27:50.992 --> 27:54.195
-Your wife's on Line 3.
-Ex-wife.

27:56.748 --> 27:57.946
Call me.

28:04.881 --> 28:06.079
Hi.

28:06.340 --> 28:09.377
-How are you doing up there?
-You heard.

28:09.761 --> 28:11.255
I heard.

28:11.763 --> 28:14.004
How about I drive up tomorrow?

28:15.266 --> 28:17.638
This isnt a very good time, Jenn.

28:17.769 --> 28:20.438
-I want to see you.
-Me, too

28:20.813 --> 28:24.478
-I'm very disappointed.
-l know.

28:31.574 --> 28:35.572
-Working too hard, Jesse.
-l know.

28:40.750 --> 28:41.829
What about therm?

28:41.959 --> 28:44.664
ls there any reason to think
the killings are related?

28:44.796 --> 28:46.041
We have two killings.

28:46.172 --> 28:50.004
We're not sure whether it's the same weapon
or weapons.  Thank you.

29:01.020 --> 29:03.938
Larry, Curly, and Moe want to talk with you.

29:06.317 --> 29:08.025
On behalf of the Town Council...

29:08.152 --> 29:12.197
Jim, Carter and I thought we ought to
get brought up tp speed on things.

29:16.244 --> 29:17.987
So, what's really going on?

29:25.920 --> 29:28.541
-That's all you know?
-Correct.

29:31.759 --> 29:33.040
Correct.

29:33.261 --> 29:36.178
-Hell.
-I told you he wasn't a talker.

29:36.597 --> 29:39.764
-So what do we tell the press?
-l like "no comment. "

29:42.893 --> 29:46.022
Over at the hight school?

29:46.023 --> 29:49.523
Maybe you could allocate your personnel
a little better.

29:51.696 --> 29:53.356
Damn it, don't you talk?

29:53.740 --> 29:55.946
Only when I have something to say.

29:56.075 --> 30:00.073
Couldn't we get this thing resolved quicker
with FBl or State help?

30:00.580 --> 30:03.913
The FBl and State Police
bring the national media.

30:04.125 --> 30:07.161
You won't like this town
when they're through with it.

30:12.341 --> 30:16.173
I'm a cop. I've been a cop for a long time.
I'm good at it.

30:16.804 --> 30:20.553
-l know how to do this. You don't.
-Damn it, we can fire you.

30:21.976 --> 30:24.728
You can. But you can't tell me what to do.

30:42.789 --> 30:44.781
You know that I'm wiser than you.

30:44.916 --> 30:48.119
Is this friendly advice,
or are you speaking as the town lawyer?

30:48.252 --> 30:49.960
I'm speaking as your pal.

30:52.090 --> 30:54.129
You want to come over tonight
and make dinner?

30:54.258 --> 30:56.796
Don't change the subject,
and don't piss them off.

30:59.597 --> 31:01.839
-No bones.
-That sounds good.

31:04.894 --> 31:07.100
-You know what sounds even better?
-What?

31:07.230 --> 31:09.685
Don't piss off the Town Council, Jesse.

31:10.608 --> 31:12.482
So, shall we say 7?

31:15.905 --> 31:17.020
I know.

31:18.699 --> 31:21.570
-What do you think?
-She's too young for him.

31:24.163 --> 31:25.955
She's about your age.

31:26.582 --> 31:28.658
Well, I'm more worldly.

31:52.942 --> 31:54.650
Does the killer scare you?

31:55.528 --> 31:58.280
Don't shrug. I want you to answer.

31:59.490 --> 32:02.195
I suppose I'd be an idiot not to be scared.

32:03.661 --> 32:06.152
-Would you shoot him?
-lf I had to.

32:07.790 --> 32:10.542
-Have you ever shot anyone before?
-Yes.

32:12.795 --> 32:14.455
Did you kill them?

32:15.882 --> 32:16.961
Yes.

32:19.135 --> 32:21.708
-Do you want to tell me about it?
-No.

32:23.890 --> 32:25.633
So you shot him dead?

32:31.355 --> 32:33.229
-Did you mean to?
-Yes.

32:34.609 --> 32:37.645
You didn't try to wound him,
shoot him in the leg or something?

32:37.779 --> 32:39.189
He had a machete.

32:44.410 --> 32:47.826
lt feels like you can't catch your breath,
there's a guy with a machete...

32:47.955 --> 32:51.490
you aim centre of mass
and try not to jerk the trigger.

32:55.671 --> 32:59.835
You've got about half a second
to figure out what needs to be done.

33:04.347 --> 33:07.632
I guess you need to be that way
if you're a policeman.

33:07.767 --> 33:10.684
Maybe I'm a policeman
because I am that way.

33:22.907 --> 33:25.612
Do you think the killings are connected?

33:27.245 --> 33:30.744
-Don't shrug. Do you have a guess?
-l try not to.

33:32.667 --> 33:35.372
Sure, but you're not just a cop.

33:35.503 --> 33:37.626
You are, after all, also a person.

33:37.755 --> 33:41.207
I'm better at being a cop,
and it's best if cops don't hope.

33:41.342 --> 33:44.177
I'm not so sure you're a
better cop than a person.

33:49.517 --> 33:51.426
I know. Thank you.

34:15.376 --> 34:18.081
He was shot up here. He must have fallen.

34:21.299 --> 34:24.583
-Family?
-Wife, three daughters.

34:25.052 --> 34:26.677
I'll talk to them.

34:27.221 --> 34:29.795
And they won't have any idea
why someone killed him.

34:29.931 --> 34:33.467
I'll ask if they know Kenneth Eisley
and Barbara Carey...

34:33.811 --> 34:38.141
and they won't. And we'll find
no connection between the three of them.

34:43.446 --> 34:45.853
lt's the same, only different.

34:47.074 --> 34:48.699
We've got a witness.

34:49.702 --> 34:52.454
-l want to talk to him.
-Okay.

34:57.752 --> 35:01.168
Philly, this is Chief Stone.
Tell him what you told me.

35:03.132 --> 35:04.543
Sure.

35:05.134 --> 35:09.713
The streets need paving.
With unpaved streets, it's very dangerous.

35:10.306 --> 35:13.093
Water in the streets,
the street's full of holes.

35:13.267 --> 35:15.889
Now, Philly, you told me you saw some cars.

35:19.649 --> 35:21.309
Police cars, too.

35:26.948 --> 35:30.897
Well, there was one car. A red Explorer.

35:33.871 --> 35:35.330
You sure about that?

36:25.256 --> 36:27.249
Hold it there a minute, Bo.

36:27.884 --> 36:29.508
You can't come in here.

36:29.635 --> 36:32.305
-You're using a controlled substance.
-A what?

36:36.517 --> 36:40.135
-This is a men's room.
-I'd like you to come down to the station.

36:46.736 --> 36:48.693
Screw you, lady.

36:49.572 --> 36:52.063
-Don't make me arrest you.
-You?

36:54.285 --> 36:55.863
Get the hell out of my way.

36:55.995 --> 36:58.403
-You have the right to remain silent.
-You crazy bitch!

36:58.539 --> 37:00.496
lf you give up that right,
everything you say...

37:00.625 --> 37:03.958
could be taken down and used against you
in a court of law.

37:04.087 --> 37:05.332
Watch yourself.

37:17.475 --> 37:19.349
So, he could have gotten the colour wrong.

37:19.477 --> 37:22.478
Exactly. And besides,
just because the car was in both places...

37:22.605 --> 37:26.472
hell, there's maybe
20, 000 red Explorers in the state.

37:26.651 --> 37:28.690
Maybe 2, 000 in the county.

37:28.820 --> 37:31.774
And that assumes
they stayed around and watched us.

37:33.074 --> 37:36.443
On the other hand,
at least we have a credible witness.

37:38.704 --> 37:39.949
Chief Stone.

37:40.081 --> 37:42.786
Your secretary called ahead.
Andrew Lincoln.

37:42.917 --> 37:44.495
-And this is my wife, Brianna.
-Hello.

37:44.627 --> 37:47.462
-Hello. This is Officer Simpson.
-Hi.

37:48.297 --> 37:49.840
Please, come in.

37:57.557 --> 37:59.514
Suit, why don't you wait here?

38:01.436 --> 38:03.808
-What did you just call him?
-Suit.

38:04.355 --> 38:06.099
Short for "suitcase. "

38:06.649 --> 38:09.567
Like Harry "Suitcase" Simpson,
the baseball player?

38:09.694 --> 38:10.808
Exactly.

38:10.945 --> 38:13.234
-Please, sit down.
-Thank you.

38:16.409 --> 38:18.117
So, is this about the killings?

38:18.244 --> 38:21.827
Yes, ma'am, it is. Your car
was in the parking lot of a murder scene.

38:21.956 --> 38:23.367
Where that woman was shot.

38:23.499 --> 38:26.951
That's where we first saw you,
investigating the crime scene.

38:27.211 --> 38:28.540
How was I doing?

38:30.214 --> 38:33.714
I was wondering if you own any guns,
specifically a . 22?

38:33.843 --> 38:36.512
We do. Registered, of course. A . 22 rifle.

38:36.637 --> 38:40.765
We used to plink vermin
at our country home from time to time.

38:40.892 --> 38:43.846
I was wondering if I could borrow it
for a couple of days.

38:43.978 --> 38:46.516
We'll just test-fire it
so we can cross you off the list.

38:46.647 --> 38:49.020
-Of course, Chief Stone.
-Jesse.

38:49.567 --> 38:51.109
I'll go get it.

38:59.744 --> 39:01.902
It's a great view, isn't it?

39:03.289 --> 39:06.409
On a cop's salary,
I could never afford a view like that.

39:09.629 --> 39:12.879
Enjoy the seaside, then get to Palm Beach
so we don't freeze to death.

39:13.007 --> 39:15.166
Good idea. What do you do, Mr. Lincoln?

39:19.680 --> 39:23.346
I used to be an ophthalmologist.
I invented an ocular scanning device...

39:23.476 --> 39:26.975
that uses laser refraction
to detect corneal depth. lt's....

39:27.688 --> 39:28.969
Anyway....

39:30.149 --> 39:32.521
So you don't practise medicine anymore?

39:32.652 --> 39:34.894
Why? Do you have something in your eye?

39:38.783 --> 39:40.822
-Mrs. Lincoln?
-Brianna.

39:41.619 --> 39:43.991
-Brianna, do you work?
-No, not now.

39:44.122 --> 39:46.494
We've been together about 15 years.

39:46.624 --> 39:49.293
ln that whole time,
we've never had an argument.

39:49.419 --> 39:52.752
-lt'd be pretty suspicious if we didn't.
-Have a fight?

39:53.339 --> 39:56.922
-No, let you borrow the rifle.
-lt would.

39:58.719 --> 40:01.507
I hope you get the son of a bitch, Jesse.

40:06.394 --> 40:09.146
People come up from the city
and think they own the place.

40:09.272 --> 40:10.766
Well, they do.

40:11.357 --> 40:13.848
-He seemed nice.
-Just a stupid cop.

40:13.985 --> 40:16.273
He didn't seem stupid to me.
He seemed polite.

40:16.404 --> 40:18.610
He was staring at your ass, for God's sake.

40:18.740 --> 40:20.613
I told you he wasn't stupid.

40:25.079 --> 40:27.950
I'll have the lab check the rifle for ballistics.

40:50.117 --> 40:54.530
And you feel in order to certify our copness,
we need to scarf these down?

40:54.663 --> 40:56.241
Yes, I do.

40:56.832 --> 41:00.367
-You're not going to eat a dozen donuts?
-Sooner or later.

41:01.796 --> 41:04.084
You're right, it's been too long.

41:08.636 --> 41:11.756
I want to know everything
about Andy and Brianna.

41:12.973 --> 41:17.220
where they live, where their country home
is, where they plink vermin...

41:17.353 --> 41:20.520
where he practiced medicine,
where he went to school.

41:25.986 --> 41:27.445
"Plink vermin. "

41:28.989 --> 41:32.109
Who the hell talks like that?
People don't talk like that.

41:32.243 --> 41:34.734
As soon as we fire the thing, we'll know.

41:34.870 --> 41:38.074
We'll know the bullets weren't fired
from that gun.

41:38.332 --> 41:41.037
-What, do you think they have another gun?
-Two.

41:41.168 --> 41:43.624
-And you think they did it?
-Yes.

41:44.005 --> 41:45.997
You have everything you need but evidence.

41:47.591 --> 41:49.880
-Except motive.
-Yeah, that, too.

41:51.595 --> 41:54.846
But you never told them
about their car being at the parking lot.

41:54.974 --> 41:57.643
There's no need to tell them all we know.

41:57.768 --> 41:59.761
Because you've got some kind of instinct?

41:59.895 --> 42:02.849
Because there's something
very phoney about them.

42:06.485 --> 42:10.613
But they're the only phonies whose car
was parked 10 feet from a homicide.

42:20.875 --> 42:23.330
So, you gonna arrest me, or what?

42:25.629 --> 42:28.299
-I'm walking out of here.
-No, you're not.

42:29.967 --> 42:32.968
-You think you can stop me?
-Of course I can.

42:34.055 --> 42:35.679
You're all show muscle.

42:35.806 --> 42:39.306
Hell, a 1 20-pound woman
hauled you in here in handcuffs.

43:10.633 --> 43:13.206
-Who's the young lady?
-l don't know.

43:13.511 --> 43:15.302
I found those pictures.

43:15.471 --> 43:17.547
-Where?
-School library.

43:18.724 --> 43:20.717
Somebody must have dropped them.

43:23.145 --> 43:25.850
You aren't one of these guys
holding her down, are you?

43:25.981 --> 43:28.555
Do you see my face
in any of those pictures?

43:31.862 --> 43:34.188
You don't have to say any more, Bo.

43:34.323 --> 43:38.024
Rita Fiore. I'm Mr. Marino's attorney
and his son's.

43:38.244 --> 43:41.364
-l didn't do anything, Dad.
-What the hell is going on?

43:41.497 --> 43:45.411
I'm holding Mr. Marino's son
on a controlled substance charge.

43:45.710 --> 43:47.702
You brought my kid in for smoking pot?

43:47.837 --> 43:50.921
You're looking at a police brutality suit.
I'll tell you right now.

43:51.048 --> 43:52.673
Shut up, Mr. Marino.

43:53.342 --> 43:57.257
We've arrested your client
for possession of a controlled substance...

43:57.388 --> 44:02.014
with intent to sell, resisting a lawful order,
and assaulting a police officer.

44:03.477 --> 44:06.597
And then there is the matter
of these pictures.

44:16.699 --> 44:19.071
I could see my way to releasing Bo...

44:19.201 --> 44:22.202
if he would identify
the boys holding her down.

44:24.248 --> 44:27.617
Chief Stone, my client is 17 years old.

44:27.752 --> 44:29.791
He has no previous convictions.

44:29.920 --> 44:32.672
You're not really gonna
keep him here overnight, are you?

44:32.798 --> 44:33.961
I am.

44:34.633 --> 44:37.207
I want you to understand something, Bo.

44:37.345 --> 44:40.215
You deny knowing the people
in these pictures.

44:40.348 --> 44:44.641
lf you're lying to us,
it would be wise if you told us right now...

44:44.769 --> 44:46.761
with your attorney present.

44:47.646 --> 44:49.271
I don't know them.

44:50.691 --> 44:54.274
Officer Crane, please take Mr. Marino
to the holding cell.

44:56.030 --> 44:57.192
Come on.

45:01.994 --> 45:05.612
-You son of a bitch.
-Chief son of a bitch to you.

45:06.499 --> 45:09.120
Unless you want to spend
the night here, too...

45:09.251 --> 45:13.997
I suggest you and Miss Fiore go someplace
and plan your brutality suit.

45:16.509 --> 45:18.086
I'll meet you outside.

45:26.811 --> 45:30.891
Healey told me you were....
What did he say? lt was kind of cute.

45:32.024 --> 45:35.808
Oh, yeah.
He said you were a real straight shooter.

45:36.654 --> 45:38.065
That is cute.

45:42.326 --> 45:43.524
See you.

46:06.642 --> 46:10.307
-Why're you keeping the kid overnight?
-Because I don't like him.

46:13.607 --> 46:15.150
How was the father?

46:15.735 --> 46:18.605
The tree doesn't grow too far
from the apple.

46:21.365 --> 46:24.532
lf you flip one of the other kids,
there might be a plea-bargain...

46:24.660 --> 46:26.819
and she'd never have to appear.

46:30.082 --> 46:31.790
You look tired, Jesse.

46:32.585 --> 46:34.743
You can only do what you can do.

46:35.338 --> 46:37.330
lf the killings aren't random...

46:37.465 --> 46:41.047
they're certainly connected
in a way only the killers understand.

46:41.969 --> 46:43.926
Suit said you've got a feeling.

46:45.348 --> 46:46.806
Cop-ly intuition.

46:47.725 --> 46:49.801
So, what are you gonna do?

46:50.436 --> 46:53.141
I'm gonna eat my pizza and mull.

46:54.398 --> 46:55.892
Mulling's good.

46:56.317 --> 46:58.938
-Good night, Jesse.
-Good night, Moll.

46:59.528 --> 47:02.565
I know you're married,
but maybe we could have an affair.

47:02.698 --> 47:04.607
I'll put you on the list.

47:09.538 --> 47:11.745
Anyway, there's this banquet hall...

47:12.333 --> 47:15.784
and it's brightly lit,
and there's a big, warm fire.

47:16.337 --> 47:18.294
And outside, it's cold and dark.

47:18.422 --> 47:22.290
But inside, everybody's eating and drinking
and having a hell of a time.

47:22.426 --> 47:25.629
And a sparrow flies
into one end of the hall...

47:25.763 --> 47:27.921
out of the cold darkness.

47:28.683 --> 47:32.265
He flies through the bright, warm hall
and out the other end...

47:32.395 --> 47:34.767
into the cold darkness again.

47:36.482 --> 47:37.513
So?

47:37.942 --> 47:42.153
Human life is like the flight of that sparrow.

47:44.323 --> 47:45.901
Or was it a swallow?

47:48.619 --> 47:51.240
I don't remember. But the point's the same.

47:52.623 --> 47:57.084
We're only here for a little while
and we have the right to make the most of it.

48:19.358 --> 48:21.018
Yeah, I know, Reggie.

48:57.063 --> 48:59.186
"You can only do what you can do. "

49:18.297 --> 49:20.088
Do you know Bo Marino?

49:22.384 --> 49:25.504
-Did he take those pictures?
-l don't know.

49:25.637 --> 49:28.971
-Was someone holding her feet?
-l don't know anything.

49:29.808 --> 49:31.184
Okay, Kevin.

49:31.894 --> 49:34.182
I'm gonna have to arrest you
for sexual assault.

49:34.313 --> 49:36.851
-No, wait a minute.
-Am I going to jail?

49:38.901 --> 49:40.858
We have pictures of you...

49:40.986 --> 49:44.236
forcibly restraining a naked young woman
who is crying.

49:44.364 --> 49:46.986
There's probably a crime
in there someplace.

49:47.576 --> 49:50.743
Tell him, Kevin. Was it Bo Marino?

49:53.707 --> 49:56.827
-Do you want to go to jail?
-He'll be pissed at me.

49:59.421 --> 50:00.999
Was it Bo Marino?

50:06.803 --> 50:07.918
Yes.

50:09.807 --> 50:11.051
Who else?

50:15.354 --> 50:16.385
Yes.

50:20.901 --> 50:24.234
-He's never been in trouble before.
-Now he is

50:25.197 --> 50:28.530
-But he's not gonna go to jail, is he?
-Not tonight.

50:29.243 --> 50:34.035
But, Mrs. Feeney, your son participated
in the gang rape of a 16-year-old girl.

50:35.123 --> 50:37.163
He'll have to answer for that.

50:39.461 --> 50:40.243
What else?

50:48.470 --> 50:49.751
through 1990.

50:49.888 --> 50:53.838
They have two cars.
the red Explorer and a black BMW.

50:54.810 --> 50:56.434
How'd you know that?

50:57.146 --> 51:01.190
I'm the police chief. I know everything.
Listen, I have to call you back.

51:05.195 --> 51:06.773
Hold that thought!

51:13.328 --> 51:16.614
-Miss Fiore.
-Save the "Miss" for court.

51:18.292 --> 51:20.000
ls this a house call?

51:21.044 --> 51:24.876
Pour me a drink, would you?
A very large, very dry martini.

51:27.176 --> 51:28.967
-You have kettle One?
-I do.

51:36.101 --> 51:38.141
My plan was for you to be so taken
with me that you'd do whatever I wanted.

51:38.520 --> 51:40.145
lt's working.

51:41.023 --> 51:44.474
That was a lousy way to get
Bo charged with sexual assault.

51:46.236 --> 51:47.481
He deserved it.

51:48.780 --> 51:51.485
I could take you apart in court for that.

51:52.409 --> 51:55.196
But if I did, how would I get you into bed?

52:06.715 --> 52:10.131
-Mostly, I'm thinking 'wow'.
-Good.  I like 'wow'.

52:11.053 --> 52:14.173
ln the small moments,
between thinking "wow"...

52:25.567 --> 52:27.145
Try not to babble.

52:34.743 --> 52:37.151
I had to know what I was dealing with.

52:41.083 --> 52:43.538
You were a homicide detective
in Los Angeles...

52:43.669 --> 52:47.085
but your marriage went south
and you had a drinking problem.

52:47.422 --> 52:49.748
-How's the marriage?
-Still south.

52:50.133 --> 52:52.126
-And the drinking?
-Better.

52:53.470 --> 52:56.804
I also know that
you have a serial killer operating here.

52:58.308 --> 53:00.978
-You must be stretched pretty thin.
-We are.

53:01.103 --> 53:04.057
But you still had time
to run down this rape thing.

53:05.274 --> 53:08.061
Usually, you get into
one of these small, suburban towns...

53:08.193 --> 53:11.776
they have a homicide,
and the State Police take over pretty quickly.

53:11.905 --> 53:14.527
We try to handle as much
as we can in-house.

53:30.257 --> 53:31.585
Buy me dinner!

53:32.843 --> 53:34.218
I'll dress up.

53:35.012 --> 53:37.004
Fluff up my body a little.

53:37.764 --> 53:38.879
Wow.

53:46.148 --> 53:49.268
I know how much pressure
you must be under now...

53:55.157 --> 53:59.368
But we agreed that
if we blew the whistle and corroborated...

53:59.495 --> 54:03.872
we might not get them, and that would
make her life very difficult in Paradise.

54:04.875 --> 54:07.033
They were gonna show my picture
to everyone.

54:07.169 --> 54:09.126
Now they probably won't.

54:12.716 --> 54:15.634
I'll give a statement.
I'll testify, if I have to.

54:19.515 --> 54:21.840
-Get off me!
-You can't go in.

54:21.975 --> 54:24.513
This is all bullshit. Kevin Feeney lied.

54:24.645 --> 54:27.314
-I'm sorry, Skipper.
-lt's all right, Tony.

54:27.648 --> 54:29.475
Close the door behind you.

54:32.194 --> 54:34.352
My kid told you he didn't threaten her.

54:34.488 --> 54:38.486
He told her that if she testified
against him, he'd kill her...

54:38.617 --> 54:40.657
Come on, it's just his
word against hers.

54:40.786 --> 54:44.071
-Don't force me to make that choice.
-What's that supposed to mean?

54:44.206 --> 54:46.875
lt means I have found Bo
to be a chronic liar.

54:47.709 --> 54:50.165
I didn't do anything to the little bitch.

54:58.720 --> 55:00.179
Let go of my son!

55:05.769 --> 55:09.637
Arrest him! I want that son of a bitch
arrested for assault.

55:20.701 --> 55:23.370
I promise they won't assault you again.

55:23.745 --> 55:24.908
What?

55:28.667 --> 55:30.292
You saw the whole thing.

55:30.544 --> 55:34.672
I saw you and Bo insult Candace
Pennington and attack her father.

55:38.802 --> 55:40.676
No, that's the way I saw it.

55:41.096 --> 55:42.341
Me, too.

55:42.931 --> 55:45.601
He punched my kid for no reason.

55:46.477 --> 55:48.553
I think there was a reason.

56:07.706 --> 56:09.995
What, the picture of you in my bedroom?

56:10.125 --> 56:12.794
What do you do with it
when you have a sleepover?

56:22.596 --> 56:25.217
-So, what do you think?
-About sleepovers?

56:25.766 --> 56:29.217
No, about me coming up.
See, every news outlet in the country...

56:29.353 --> 56:32.389
is dying for some sort of
inside something on this.

56:32.606 --> 56:33.721
I know.

56:34.399 --> 56:38.065
I thought I could come out with
a cameraman and track the investigation.

56:38.195 --> 56:40.900
An inside look at how you're handling it.

56:41.532 --> 56:44.698
-No.
-We could do a whole series about it.

56:45.744 --> 56:48.282
-No, Jenn.
-I'd stay out of the way.

56:56.797 --> 56:58.077
Hey, Abby.

58:09.870 --> 58:10.985
Hey, Jesse.

58:13.457 --> 58:16.078
Two in the chest, just like the others.

58:16.210 --> 58:19.413
Cold morning.
Might make the time of death a little harder.

58:19.546 --> 58:20.709
Hey, Doc.

58:21.632 --> 58:22.830
Not now.

58:31.308 --> 58:32.968
Jesse, I'm sorry.

59:32.452 --> 59:36.118
Maybe I should just say, "The hell with it, "
and be a drunk.

01:00:28.004 --> 01:00:31.503
I don't see what purpose is served
by locking these children up.

01:00:31.632 --> 01:00:35.582
You think they didn't know it was wrong?
That they couldn't control themselves?

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:39.219
-Well, they didn't.
-No plea-bargains. They deserve jail time.

01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:43.720
Right now, Candace can't imagine
going to school tomorrow.

01:00:43.853 --> 01:00:47.304
She cannot imagine facing all the kids
that will know...

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:50.144
she was gang-raped
and photographed naked...

01:00:50.276 --> 01:00:54.985
and the three guys who did it
will be in the same school with her.

01:00:55.698 --> 01:00:57.157
Maybe the same class.

01:00:57.283 --> 01:01:00.319
I may not be a little girl anymore,
but I am a woman.

01:01:00.494 --> 01:01:02.653
And as a woman, I sympathise with her.

01:01:02.788 --> 01:01:05.493
Did the court specify
the community service?

01:01:06.667 --> 01:01:07.698
Not yet.

01:01:12.006 --> 01:01:16.419
Let me have each of them in a cell for
an hour. Let me beat the crap out of them.

01:01:17.595 --> 01:01:19.671
-You're joking?
-l am.

01:01:21.307 --> 01:01:25.305
But why not let them serve their sentence
with the police department?

01:01:25.895 --> 01:01:30.058
You would, of course, take your
supervisory responsibilities seriously.

01:01:30.191 --> 01:01:32.100
I would bust their chops

01:01:37.573 --> 01:01:39.233
I'll see what I can do.

01:01:40.868 --> 01:01:43.786
What about unsolved murders
in the Cleveland area?

01:01:45.623 --> 01:01:48.873
A young girl was shot at a bus stop
in Parma, which is near Cleveland.

01:01:49.001 --> 01:01:51.041
I know where Parma is.

01:01:52.588 --> 01:01:55.126
The only thing that matches this m. o...

01:01:55.257 --> 01:01:58.543
are two killings in Hilton Head, 1999...

01:01:58.678 --> 01:02:01.133
and three in Florida, 2002.

01:02:01.389 --> 01:02:02.883
Where in Florida?

01:02:09.772 --> 01:02:12.524
There's a guy from CNN here.
He wants to speak with you.

01:02:15.111 --> 01:02:16.735
He won't like that.

01:02:17.113 --> 01:02:20.529
There's a press briefing every morning.
Tell him where and when.

01:02:20.658 --> 01:02:21.689
Okay.

01:02:22.451 --> 01:02:24.195
Maybe now we can get a search warrant.

01:02:24.328 --> 01:02:27.199
No judge is gonna give us a search warrant
with what we've got.

01:02:27.331 --> 01:02:28.612
And the weapons won't be there.

01:02:28.749 --> 01:02:31.454
-We can try.
-l don't want them to stop!

01:02:49.645 --> 01:02:51.187
That's good work.

01:02:52.231 --> 01:02:54.520
You may make Detective someday.

01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:58.603
We don't have any detectives.

01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:03.065
Well... if we did.

01:03:23.137 --> 01:03:25.213
I'm sorry about your girlfriend.

01:03:26.515 --> 01:03:29.351
She wasn't my girlfriend. She was my pal.

01:03:31.687 --> 01:03:33.146
No, thank you.

01:03:33.272 --> 01:03:35.561
-You're not drinking?
-l don't drink.

01:03:38.027 --> 01:03:39.486
I did, but I don't.

01:03:49.705 --> 01:03:53.454
The DA went for your plan.
So what are you gonna do?

01:03:55.294 --> 01:03:59.208
I'm gonna take them over to Doc Perkins
and have them sterilised.

01:04:01.050 --> 01:04:04.335
The Marino family wants me
to file charges against you.

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:08.764
-lt all happened so quickly.
-I'm sure.

01:04:09.976 --> 01:04:12.513
I could tell you're kind of slow to react.

01:04:12.645 --> 01:04:15.848
Bo attacked Candace's dad
who responded in self-defence.

01:04:15.982 --> 01:04:19.979
Then Joe Marino jumped in and Chuck
had to defend himself from both of them.

01:04:33.249 --> 01:04:35.822
I was a prosecutor in a previous life.

01:04:37.044 --> 01:04:38.836
Don't beat yourself up.

01:04:39.296 --> 01:04:42.712
lt's the toughest kind of case:
motiveless, random killing.

01:04:43.259 --> 01:04:46.959
lt seems that serial killers only screw up
when it gets personal.

01:04:52.101 --> 01:04:54.058
So, when do we go to court?

01:04:54.395 --> 01:04:56.968
This one isn't a winner for our side.

01:04:57.398 --> 01:04:59.723
I'll persuade my clients to drop it.

01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:02.398
-And if they won't?
-They'll drop it.

01:05:06.866 --> 01:05:10.946
So, off the record, what really happened
with Bo and his father?

01:05:11.787 --> 01:05:15.785
Pennington smacked the crap out of Bo
and his old man, and I let him.

01:05:16.417 --> 01:05:19.169
-I'm shocked.
-Not that shocked.

01:05:23.716 --> 01:05:25.625
lt'll be our secret.

01:05:26.093 --> 01:05:29.379
Perhaps before we're through,
there'll be several more.

01:05:49.533 --> 01:05:52.321
Ballistics came back on the third victim.

01:05:53.287 --> 01:05:56.288
Same as the first two. Same two guns.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.085
-Who else knows about this?
-So far, just you and me.

01:06:07.593 --> 01:06:09.301
lt's freezing out here.

01:06:10.012 --> 01:06:12.966
The day I left LAPD,
I drove out to Santa Monica...

01:06:13.099 --> 01:06:15.222
and just looked out at the ocean.

01:06:15.768 --> 01:06:18.804
I lost my wife and my job. lt calmed me.

01:06:21.148 --> 01:06:23.853
-Are you feeling that way now?
-No.

01:06:24.026 --> 01:06:25.307
I'm angry.

01:06:26.529 --> 01:06:28.189
They killed my friend.

01:06:28.322 --> 01:06:31.774
So you think it was intentional,
this killing your friend?

01:06:32.785 --> 01:06:33.816
Yes.

01:06:36.038 --> 01:06:37.616
I know who did this.

01:06:39.625 --> 01:06:42.626
I know who killed Eisley,
the woman in the parking lot...

01:06:42.753 --> 01:06:45.244
The guy in ther alley, and Abby...

01:06:46.632 --> 01:06:48.506
I know who killed them.

01:06:49.885 --> 01:06:51.712
-Do you have a motive?
-No.

01:06:51.887 --> 01:06:53.512
-Witnesses?
-No.

01:06:55.099 --> 01:06:58.016
Hell, I'll warm up a cell right now.

01:07:00.062 --> 01:07:01.556
There's two of them.

01:07:02.565 --> 01:07:05.352
And they're not gonna stop. I won't let them.

01:07:12.116 --> 01:07:15.117
So these two people,
they have an interest in killing people...

01:07:15.244 --> 01:07:17.700
and now they seem to have an interest
in killing you?

01:07:17.830 --> 01:07:19.870
ls this a great country or what?

01:07:20.374 --> 01:07:24.953
Jesse, you might want to be a little careful
with these people.

01:07:27.173 --> 01:07:30.506
-I'm a little careful with everyone.
-The hell you are.

01:07:32.762 --> 01:07:35.513
lt would not be good to take this personally.

01:07:36.515 --> 01:07:39.089
I've been at this thing too long to be wrong.

01:07:39.226 --> 01:07:42.975
I'm not gonna sit around
and wait for someone to find another body.

01:07:54.659 --> 01:07:56.900
You just love to make me nervous.

01:08:04.168 --> 01:08:05.283
Need a ride?

01:08:07.338 --> 01:08:08.915
He's going to see you.

01:08:15.554 --> 01:08:16.752
That sounds good.

01:08:16.889 --> 01:08:19.345
-You know what sounds even better?
-What?

01:08:32.488 --> 01:08:34.362
I think he looks worried.

01:08:37.283 --> 01:08:39.609
Maybe we've been too hard on him.

01:08:40.662 --> 01:08:44.957
Human life is like the flight of that sparrow.

01:09:04.353 --> 01:09:05.764
This is Reggie.

01:09:06.604 --> 01:09:08.479
Thought you might need this.

01:09:12.403 --> 01:09:16.234
-They took a ballistics test?
-Yes, we did. We sent it to Boston.

01:09:16.948 --> 01:09:19.654
Come into the living room.
Brianna doesn't wanna miss you.

01:09:19.785 --> 01:09:21.694
Bri, honey, it's Jesse.

01:09:25.624 --> 01:09:28.460
I assume it's not linked
to a drive-by shooting or anything.

01:09:28.586 --> 01:09:31.124
Actually, the rifle's never been fired.

01:09:31.881 --> 01:09:33.872
So much for plinking vermin.

01:09:34.133 --> 01:09:36.837
-Must have been one of your other . 22s.
-No.

01:09:36.969 --> 01:09:38.843
I have no other guns.

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:40.877
Jesse Stone.

01:09:41.015 --> 01:09:42.343
-Brianna.
-Hello.

01:09:42.558 --> 01:09:44.930
What a beautiful dog you brought!

01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:47.386
Hello. What a sweet doggie.

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:49.180
Hello, you little noodle.

01:09:49.314 --> 01:09:52.979
Actually, I've kind of adopted him.
He belonged to the first victim.

01:09:53.109 --> 01:09:55.269
Well, that's awfully good of you.

01:09:56.656 --> 01:09:58.031
How sweet.

01:09:58.991 --> 01:10:01.909
-l think he likes you.
-Of course he likes me.

01:10:05.289 --> 01:10:06.748
You going someplace?

01:10:06.874 --> 01:10:09.709
Well, like we said,
we're only here a short time.

01:10:10.419 --> 01:10:12.661
-When do you leave?
-Tomorrow night.

01:10:13.005 --> 01:10:16.837
-How's the investigation going?
-Actually, not too good.

01:10:17.927 --> 01:10:20.548
I hope the victims didn't suffer too much.

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:23.680
I wonder what it's like
to know you're gonna die.

01:10:24.392 --> 01:10:27.013
Have you ever been in that position, Jesse?

01:10:27.228 --> 01:10:30.928
I'm just a small-town cop.
Mostly, I give out parking tickets.

01:10:31.774 --> 01:10:34.347
lt must make everything very intense.

01:10:35.403 --> 01:10:39.270
I always wondered what it was like
for the shooter. That must be intense.

01:10:39.407 --> 01:10:42.277
Exercising the ultimate human power.

01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:46.242
-lf he thinks about that kind of stuff.
-Do you think he does?

01:10:46.372 --> 01:10:49.823
I'm just a small-town cop.
Mostly, I give out parking tickets.

01:10:50.793 --> 01:10:54.127
-Do you have any leads?
-l was pinning my hopes on you.

01:10:55.464 --> 01:10:57.124
Everyone needs a hobby.

01:10:58.175 --> 01:11:01.876
Seriously, though,
why would we do such a thing?

01:11:03.139 --> 01:11:04.549
A shared sickness.

01:11:07.226 --> 01:11:09.135
At least we would be sharing.

01:11:16.444 --> 01:11:18.235
Who was the last victim?

01:11:20.406 --> 01:11:21.865
A friend of mine.

01:11:21.991 --> 01:11:25.075
Abby Taylor. I read that in the paper.

01:11:25.328 --> 01:11:28.531
lt must be very hard
when it's someone so close to you.

01:11:29.623 --> 01:11:30.703
I'm sorry.

01:11:32.251 --> 01:11:33.330
So am l.

01:11:39.008 --> 01:11:42.258
Abigail, oh, Abigail
Have you met Abigail?

01:11:43.512 --> 01:11:46.928
The queen of the tattooed ladies

01:11:54.161 --> 01:11:55.571
How is it?

01:11:56.830 --> 01:11:59.321
My mother is kind of sulky.

01:12:01.126 --> 01:12:03.498
-And your father?
-Daddy's great.

01:12:03.670 --> 01:12:06.956
I never saw him fight with anybody before,
for me.

01:12:10.177 --> 01:12:13.131
-You didn't try to stop it.
-He was winning.

01:12:14.598 --> 01:12:16.471
Daddy boxed in college.

01:12:16.767 --> 01:12:20.467
He must have been pretty good.
There's not a mark on his face.

01:12:20.896 --> 01:12:23.683
-Did you ever box?
-l don't box, I fight.

01:12:24.941 --> 01:12:27.017
-What's the difference?
-Rules.

01:12:30.906 --> 01:12:32.945
So, how is it at school?

01:12:35.368 --> 01:12:39.152
Sometimes Bo or Troy will stare at me
when I go past.

01:12:40.165 --> 01:12:41.992
But they don't say anything.

01:12:44.336 --> 01:12:48.749
Everyone else, most of the kids,
have been okay about it.

01:12:50.050 --> 01:12:51.164
Good.

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:04.474
I want you to know
I appreciate what you did for me.

01:13:06.942 --> 01:13:09.230
-Could you do me a favour?
-Sure.

01:13:09.986 --> 01:13:13.438
Reggie here has got no owner, no family.

01:13:14.866 --> 01:13:16.693
I'm never home...

01:13:17.411 --> 01:13:19.948
and he really needs someone
to look after him.

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.832
-Could you do that?
-l don't know, my mum--

01:13:22.958 --> 01:13:25.200
I can talk to your mum about it.

01:13:26.211 --> 01:13:28.120
But you have to take care of him.

01:13:28.255 --> 01:13:31.421
-Feed him, walk him, clean up after him.
-l know.

01:13:32.717 --> 01:13:34.046
I can do it.

01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:36.714
I know you can.

01:13:48.525 --> 01:13:49.556
What?

01:13:52.112 --> 01:13:53.986
I'm sorry about your friend.

01:13:56.074 --> 01:13:57.616
Thank you, Candace.

01:14:21.308 --> 01:14:24.593
-So, why Abby?
-Because she was close to me.

01:14:26.813 --> 01:14:30.645
-So you think they want to kill you next?
-l kind of wish they'd try.

01:14:32.486 --> 01:14:34.562
I know they're not finished.

01:14:36.615 --> 01:14:40.315
They know where you live. Why don't
they lurk around your house and shoot you?

01:14:40.452 --> 01:14:42.943
They want to do something more artistic.

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:45.571
They are crazy. I tend to forget that.

01:14:45.874 --> 01:14:47.914
I think they made a mistake.

01:14:49.252 --> 01:14:50.747
lt's not random anymore.

01:14:50.879 --> 01:14:54.213
They seem to want to taunt me,
see my reaction.

01:14:54.883 --> 01:14:57.718
You might want to think
about being a little careful.

01:14:57.844 --> 01:14:59.255
I need evidence.

01:14:59.930 --> 01:15:02.136
You think they'll come at you the same way?

01:15:02.265 --> 01:15:05.219
Serial killers like ritual.
They'll do it the same.

01:15:05.602 --> 01:15:09.979
Jesse, you're a good man and a good cop.
Better than this town deserves.

01:15:11.566 --> 01:15:13.808
lt matters what happens to you.

01:15:14.778 --> 01:15:18.692
The ugly truth of it, Moll,
is it doesn't matter a hell of a lot to me.

01:15:19.741 --> 01:15:22.113
A lot of people love you, Jesse.

01:15:23.036 --> 01:15:25.159
-lncluding you?
-Especially me.

01:15:26.039 --> 01:15:28.530
And don't shut me off by being cute.

01:15:29.418 --> 01:15:31.410
lt's hard for me not to be cute.

01:15:42.681 --> 01:15:46.216
I think Reggie will be good for Candace.
That was sweet.

01:16:32.689 --> 01:16:36.557
I don't know if I thanked you enough
for all that you've done for me.

01:16:37.277 --> 01:16:40.728
I mean, you did so much,
and now maybe Reggie and....

01:16:42.574 --> 01:16:45.908
Well, ljust wanted you to know that
I'm your friend...

01:16:46.036 --> 01:16:49.072
and I feel really close to you.

01:17:08.475 --> 01:17:10.598
-It's Jesse

01:17:11.895 --> 01:17:14.979
Listen, I need to see you
both beofre you leave.

01:17:15.107 --> 01:17:19.603
The parking lot by the canal,
where Abby Taylor was killed. You know.

01:17:20.153 --> 01:17:22.442
-When?
-Tonight, 10. 00.

01:17:22.572 --> 01:17:24.197
ls this official?

01:17:40.674 --> 01:17:43.165
He thinks he's setting some sort of trap.

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:46.132
-Can he do anything?
-lt doesn't matter.

01:17:47.389 --> 01:17:50.840
This just makes it easier.
Now we know where he'll be.

01:17:59.234 --> 01:18:00.894
Why am I here, again?

01:18:04.781 --> 01:18:06.904
That's lovely and chivalrous of you...

01:18:07.033 --> 01:18:11.078
and I know you do it because you
care about me, but it's still dreaming.

01:18:12.164 --> 01:18:14.702
-You see anything, Sult?
-Nothing yet

01:18:21.923 --> 01:18:23.963
That's why I've got you, Molly.

01:18:42.235 --> 01:18:44.524
Jesse, I don't think they're coming.

01:18:58.585 --> 01:19:01.206
We'll get there as soon as we can.
You got that, Suit?

01:19:01.338 --> 01:19:02.452
On our way.

01:19:32.661 --> 01:19:35.662
-l won't have a dog in my house.
-This is different.

01:19:39.543 --> 01:19:41.998
-I'll take care of him.
-Except for when you don't.

01:19:42.129 --> 01:19:43.208
Dad.

01:19:48.885 --> 01:19:51.459
Margaret, this means so much to her.

01:19:51.805 --> 01:19:55.304
-You know the rule.
-Can't we bend the rule this time?

01:19:55.559 --> 01:19:57.017
Reggie needs a home.

01:19:57.144 --> 01:20:00.098
You know how I feel
about animals in the house.

01:20:00.313 --> 01:20:02.887
He's a great dog. He's already housebroken.

01:20:03.108 --> 01:20:05.777
-I promise, I'll take care of him.
-Margaret.

01:20:06.319 --> 01:20:09.985
-But I really want him.
-l won't have a dog in my house.

01:20:10.323 --> 01:20:13.942
-This is different. I'll take care of him.
-Except for when you don't.

01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:18.454
Candace isn't home.

01:20:55.327 --> 01:20:56.655
Pick it up.

01:21:01.541 --> 01:21:04.328
-And let you execute me?
-Pick it up.

01:21:07.422 --> 01:21:09.214
I didn't shoot anybody.

01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:15.922
I may do some jail time,
but no court of law will execute me.

01:21:19.684 --> 01:21:21.724
I'll outlive you, Jesse.

01:21:30.570 --> 01:21:31.768
Get up.

01:22:35.177 --> 01:22:38.343
Put the gun away, Suit,
before you shoot somebody.

01:22:42.184 --> 01:22:43.594
You all right?

01:22:47.314 --> 01:22:49.105
Two guns, one shooter.

01:22:50.776 --> 01:22:52.400
Give that to Healey.

01:23:59.886 --> 01:24:01.713
What are you looking at?

01:24:05.225 --> 01:24:07.550
Jesse, are you there?

01:24:10.522 --> 01:24:11.897
I'm sorry.

01:24:12.899 --> 01:24:17.360
I want you to know that I realise I was
thinking only about myself and my career.

01:24:17.821 --> 01:24:20.608
And I know
I've often been that way with you.

01:24:23.618 --> 01:24:26.489
Jesse, are you there?

01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:14.900
