00:02.666 --> 00:04.199
<i>Hi, Ez.</i>

00:04.234 --> 00:07.269
<i>There is no easy way to say it,
but here it is.</i>

00:07.304 --> 00:09.170
<i>You will never see me again.</i>

00:09.206 --> 00:14.476
<i>Sooner you accept it,
the better it is for everyone.</i>

00:14.511 --> 00:16.030
- Where is she?
- I don't know where...

00:16.146 --> 00:17.490
- Where is she?
- I don't know where...

00:17.514 --> 00:19.180
I am her husband.

00:19.216 --> 00:22.550
Yes, we married the same woman,
and she took us both.

00:22.586 --> 00:24.886
<i>Do you have a picture of Alice?</i>

00:24.922 --> 00:26.221
Well, that's her.

00:27.561 --> 00:28.760
Hello, Alice.

00:28.796 --> 00:29.974
Hello, Ava.

00:30.297 --> 00:33.365
Hi, I'm Ms. Keyes.
You can call me Saffron.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.434
Ms. Keyes,
you are a breath of fresh air.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.736
Well, aren't you
my knight in shining armor?

00:37.771 --> 00:39.115
The way I see it, man,
you either want to find her

00:39.139 --> 00:40.439
- or you don't.
- I do.

00:40.474 --> 00:42.374
Then do whatever it takes.

00:42.409 --> 00:43.775
What are you two zibs doing?

00:43.811 --> 00:46.211
- Go, go, go!
- My God. Okay, okay.

00:46.247 --> 00:47.479
That did not go well!

00:47.515 --> 00:48.881
- This girl...
- Saffron.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.983
Such a pretty name.

00:51.018 --> 00:52.217
And you like her?

00:52.253 --> 00:54.586
<i>She makes me want to be nice.</i>

00:54.622 --> 00:56.622
<i>I think you have good
luck with this girl.</i>

00:56.657 --> 00:58.301
Come on, why don't you sit
with me for a minute?

00:58.325 --> 00:59.958
Saturday I'm having a barbecue,

00:59.994 --> 01:01.627
some friends, some family coming by.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.428
Why don't you join us?

01:03.464 --> 01:05.308
Max is just freaking out
'cause I talked to some guy

01:05.331 --> 01:06.632
at a coffee shop.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.467
<i>The Doctor sent me a message...</i>

01:08.502 --> 01:10.769
<i>that anybody not in the life,
not like us,</i>

01:10.804 --> 01:12.604
<i>is a liability.</i>

01:17.144 --> 01:18.010
Who the hell are you?

01:18.145 --> 01:19.645
Who the hell are you?

01:19.680 --> 01:20.812
Do you know this woman?

01:20.848 --> 01:23.515
- She's my wife.
- No way.

01:27.955 --> 01:30.155
<i>And I answer the door,
and it's these two guys</i>

01:30.190 --> 01:31.456
I've never seen before.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.926
Like, one of them's kind of macho,

01:33.961 --> 01:36.461
and the other's kind of not.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.764
And they just start barraging
me with these questions,

01:38.799 --> 01:40.465
like, demanding to see her, and...

01:40.501 --> 01:42.534
Who?

01:42.570 --> 01:44.870
CeCe. They were looking for CeCe.

01:44.905 --> 01:46.872
Interesting.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.885
Yeah, and they're telling me
they've come all the way from...

01:48.909 --> 01:51.543
I don't know... someplace...
Indiana or something...

01:51.579 --> 01:54.546
And they're sure... they're, like,
positive she's in my apartment

01:54.582 --> 01:57.349
presently, and they have these
weird surveillance pictures

01:57.384 --> 01:59.629
of her and other pictures of
her where she just looks totally

01:59.653 --> 02:01.164
different, and they keep
calling her these other names,

02:01.188 --> 02:03.221
like Amy and Ava or Alice or something,

02:03.257 --> 02:04.990
which is just totally crazy-making.

02:05.025 --> 02:08.226
Well, you actually
don't know her real name.

02:08.262 --> 02:10.262
Yeah, I know, okay. I'm just saying.

02:11.732 --> 02:12.798
Go on.

02:12.833 --> 02:16.969
Anyway, then they tell me...

02:17.004 --> 02:19.171
man...

02:19.206 --> 02:21.006
that she conned them too,

02:21.041 --> 02:23.408
same thing, married them,
took all their money, disappeared.

02:23.444 --> 02:25.077
- Really?
- Yeah, I know.

02:25.112 --> 02:26.752
So now I'm starting
to get trigged, right?

02:26.780 --> 02:28.592
So I do the positive
thinking that we worked on,

02:28.616 --> 02:30.082
and I even take out my cards.

02:30.117 --> 02:31.683
Great. That's what they're there for.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.752
Yeah, I start reading
them to these guys loudly.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.153
I'm saying, "She's gone."

02:35.189 --> 02:36.555
"She's not here.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.223
She's not coming back."

02:38.258 --> 02:41.860
And still they won't shut up,
so I tell them forcefully,

02:41.895 --> 02:43.595
"Whatever happened to you, I'm sorry.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.342
Like, I'm genuinely sorry,
but I can't help you."

02:45.366 --> 02:46.598
- Yeah, boundaries.
- Right?

02:46.634 --> 02:47.933
I have done work on myself.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.368
I have healed.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.770
I refuse to be part
of some deranged, like,

02:51.805 --> 02:53.839
seriously demented plan to go after her.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.774
- Absolutely not.
- I'm fine. I'm over her.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.009
Yes, you are.

02:57.044 --> 02:58.410
I am fine.

02:58.445 --> 03:00.112
I'm fine.

03:07.721 --> 03:08.920
Ma'am, please.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.222
If you could just hear us out.

03:10.257 --> 03:11.221
I told you.

03:11.222 --> 03:13.258
It's odd-number alternate
side-street Tuesday.

03:13.293 --> 03:14.960
And we're sorry. We misread the sign.

03:14.995 --> 03:16.106
We'd absolutely move the car,
but we can't...

03:16.130 --> 03:17.963
This one locked the keys inside.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.209
Well, you didn't tell me
the keys were in the back.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.091
Do we have to have conversations
about everything now?

03:21.092 --> 03:23.077
No, we don't have to have
conversations about which kind

03:23.078 --> 03:26.471
of face cleanser is
unavailable in farm country.

03:26.507 --> 03:27.739
Wow.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.441
You guys have yourselves a nice day.

03:29.476 --> 03:30.709
Please, ma'am.

03:30.744 --> 03:33.245
Ma'am, ma'am, can we...

03:34.615 --> 03:36.081
Clearly with your forces combined

03:36.116 --> 03:38.183
you won't have any trouble finding her.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.820
That was sarcasm.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.823
Or do they not have that
where you come from?

03:44.858 --> 03:46.425
There's obviously no way

03:46.460 --> 03:48.071
you're figuring out
where she is without me,

03:48.095 --> 03:52.497
so... I'm in.

03:54.000 --> 04:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:07.114 --> 04:09.281
Brought you some coffee.

04:09.316 --> 04:10.816
No, thanks. I already had mine.

04:14.388 --> 04:18.423
Hey, I'm sorry if I was terrible Friday.

04:18.459 --> 04:19.825
I don't remember much,

04:19.860 --> 04:23.662
except that you were
a perfect gentleman.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.897
Nothing to apologize for.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.968
But I don't think this is
appropriate conversation

04:30.003 --> 04:33.338
for the workplace.

04:34.575 --> 04:36.608
Understood.

04:36.643 --> 04:38.076
Let me know if you need anything.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.012
You have a gift, you know.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.924
It's true. You're a...

04:53.870 --> 04:56.762
- natural.
- Yeah.

04:56.797 --> 05:00.198
Um, you know...

05:00.234 --> 05:02.033
I am concerned we're not gonna finish

05:02.069 --> 05:04.169
these end-of-quarter filings by Monday.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.169
Well, I'm free this weekend.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.919
It's on. He's taking me out
tomorrow night.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.490
We're right on schedule.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.659
Are we?

05:27.694 --> 05:32.230
I told you I'll close
him tomorrow night.

05:32.266 --> 05:34.432
Good.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.912
What do you mean, I can't join?

05:46.947 --> 05:48.525
What do you have, a club?
Like a boys' club?

05:48.549 --> 05:50.448
- It's not a club.
- But we do have a code.

05:50.484 --> 05:51.817
You guys came to me.

05:51.852 --> 05:52.996
Yes, but we weren't looking for you.

05:53.020 --> 05:53.966
We thought she'd be here.

05:53.967 --> 05:56.087
We didn't know she'd
conned you before Richard.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.956
Wait, what? She went from me to you?

05:57.991 --> 05:59.951
Guess she must have thought
something was missing.

06:00.627 --> 06:02.360
Guys, come on. Can...

06:02.396 --> 06:03.628
Wait. Did you give her HPV?

06:03.664 --> 06:05.263
No.

06:05.299 --> 06:06.485
- No.
- All I'm saying is,

06:06.486 --> 06:08.197
- I can help you guys find her.
- That's not what you said

06:08.198 --> 06:09.550
before, and you said
we were delusional...

06:09.551 --> 06:10.901
- Pathetic...
- And that you were over her...

06:10.902 --> 06:12.359
And you threw flashcards at us.

06:12.360 --> 06:13.551
Do you guys want to find her or not?

06:13.552 --> 06:14.855
Because clearly you need some help.

06:14.856 --> 06:16.765
Really? How so? What exactly do we need?

06:16.766 --> 06:18.777
Help reading street signs,

06:18.812 --> 06:20.190
someone to make sure
the keys are, you know,

06:20.214 --> 06:22.280
not in the car when you lock it,

06:22.316 --> 06:23.748
something about women.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.550
- Told you, lesbian card.
- My God.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.630
You guys are so far out of your league;
You have no idea.

06:27.654 --> 06:29.165
- Well, we found you, didn't we?
- You weren't looking for me.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.523
Well, yeah, but... still.

06:31.558 --> 06:35.360
So what are you and SpongeBob
Square Jaw gonna do now?

06:35.395 --> 06:36.873
You're sharing a bowl
of chicken noodle soup?

06:36.897 --> 06:38.508
I bet you don't even
have money for lunch.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.665
Hey, we didn't have money
for gas or hotels either,

06:40.701 --> 06:42.067
but we figured it out.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.735
- We don't need your help.
- Yes, you do.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.737
No, we don't.

06:45.772 --> 06:47.973
God, you are so desperate;
It's pathetic.

06:48.008 --> 06:48.974
I am not pathetic.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.575
Whoa, whoa.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.577
Hey, Jules, listen,
seriously, no hard feelings,

06:52.613 --> 06:54.691
we've all been through a lot,
but I really think it's best

06:54.715 --> 06:56.326
if we just, you know,
went our separate ways.

06:56.350 --> 06:58.984
No, you don't get
to just barge into my life

06:59.019 --> 07:00.897
right when I was getting better,
when I was, like,

07:00.921 --> 07:02.587
this close to getting over her.

07:02.623 --> 07:05.824
You don't get to do
that and then reject me.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.659
I reject you.

07:07.694 --> 07:09.394
Reject us.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.130
Jeez, man, what a freakin' psycho.

07:12.165 --> 07:14.566
I don't know, man.
I think she's just heartbroken like us.

07:14.601 --> 07:15.867
Like us, my ass, dude.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.335
That chick is seriously disturbed.

07:17.371 --> 07:19.070
My God.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.538
What?

07:20.574 --> 07:22.507
Augh!

07:22.542 --> 07:23.542
You all right?

07:23.577 --> 07:25.243
You hit me, you asshole.

07:25.279 --> 07:26.656
You ran right into the street.
You hit me.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.413
I can't feel my arm. Look what you did.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.849
- You ran right into my car.
- You plowed right into me.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.484
Shit, my phone.

07:32.519 --> 07:34.097
You broke my phone,
and you broke my arm.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.899
All right, let's...
Okay, let's just calm down.

07:35.923 --> 07:39.925
- This was not my fault.
- Did anyone see him hit me?

07:39.960 --> 07:41.860
Yeah, yeah, I saw it. You hit her.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.161
What? No.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.507
- I... no, no.
- Yeah, you did, man.

07:44.531 --> 07:46.075
I got it on video. You totally hit her.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.577
Hey, someone... someone call the cops.

07:47.601 --> 07:48.700
No, no, no. No, wait.

07:53.573 --> 07:54.851
- I'm calling right now.
- Wait, no.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.241
You do not need to call the cops.

07:56.276 --> 07:57.943
We can handle this. We can handle this.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.544
All right.

07:59.579 --> 08:02.547
Can we? Can we... can we handle this?

08:02.582 --> 08:04.115
- Can we handle it?
- Okay.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.885
Okay? Okay, great.

08:06.920 --> 08:07.886
Augh.

08:07.921 --> 08:10.455
Here, just... just take it.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.923
- Okay.
- Yeah, we're good.

08:12.782 --> 08:14.225
Well, get the hell out of here!

08:14.261 --> 08:16.061
Watch where you're driving, bud.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.930
Augh.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.800
Augh.

08:21.835 --> 08:22.801
You're not serious.

08:22.836 --> 08:26.104
480, 490, 500.

08:26.514 --> 08:28.461
Lunch is on me, boys.

08:30.344 --> 08:31.910
How'd you do that?

08:31.945 --> 08:34.245
You just threw yourself in
front of a car for 500 bucks.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.591
Smacked my hands against the hood.

08:35.615 --> 08:37.414
Didn't even touch me.

08:37.451 --> 08:39.083
What?

08:39.119 --> 08:41.385
How'd you guys get out
of your piano recitals?

08:41.421 --> 08:44.422
So am I in or what?

08:47.527 --> 08:49.060
Make yourselves at home.

08:51.131 --> 08:52.897
Whoa.

08:52.933 --> 08:55.100
This place is seriously large.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.669
How often do you throw yourself
in front of moving cars?

08:57.704 --> 08:58.670
It's not really mine.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.505
Belongs to my parents.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.675
After CeCe took everything,
they cut me off.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.845
But I can live here as
long as I stay in therapy.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.315
That way they can shame me
without feeling like monsters.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.951
So my shrink told me to
throw away everything

09:12.986 --> 09:15.920
that had any association with her.

09:15.956 --> 09:18.690
I got as far as putting it in a bag.

09:25.399 --> 09:27.098
Wow.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.835
Wow.

09:44.051 --> 09:47.318
So this is what you meant when
you said you were an artist?

09:47.354 --> 09:50.955
I wouldn't expect you to get it.

09:52.859 --> 09:55.627
All right, with what I know
about her and what you guys

09:55.662 --> 09:57.962
know about her,
we might just find a clue

09:57.998 --> 10:00.331
to who she really is.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.073
Now let's find this bitch.

10:02.720 --> 10:03.811
Don't call her that.

10:12.603 --> 10:13.769
Sorry to disturb, Doctor.

10:13.804 --> 10:15.437
There's an urgent call for you.

10:15.473 --> 10:17.139
I told you no interruptions.

10:17.175 --> 10:18.474
It's Dr. Steppenwolf.

10:21.679 --> 10:24.280
Patch it through.

10:29.253 --> 10:30.319
Yes.

10:30.354 --> 10:32.221
I'm getting close, Doctor.

10:32.256 --> 10:34.790
It's a complicated case,
and I'm not entirely sure yet

10:34.825 --> 10:38.294
if the patient is truly infected.

10:38.329 --> 10:40.829
<i>We need a prognosis as soon as possible.</i>

10:40.865 --> 10:42.464
<i>If his disease turns out to be fatal,</i>

10:42.500 --> 10:44.266
<i>I would hate for it to spread.</i>

10:44.302 --> 10:46.835
I understand, Doctor,
and I'll have it for you very soon.

10:46.871 --> 10:48.241
Very good.

11:20.071 --> 11:22.037
Hello.

11:34.345 --> 11:35.745
Hey, look who's here.

11:35.780 --> 11:36.912
- Hey.
- You made it.

11:36.948 --> 11:38.247
Yeah, I made it.

11:38.282 --> 11:39.415
I can't stay too long.

11:39.450 --> 11:40.583
I hope that's okay.

11:40.618 --> 11:42.318
No, I'm glad you came.

11:42.353 --> 11:43.886
Yeah, me too.

11:43.921 --> 11:45.632
Come on.
Let me introduce you to my friends.

11:45.656 --> 11:47.757
Okay.

11:47.792 --> 11:49.592
Got Dave and Sheila.

11:49.627 --> 11:51.127
- Hi.
- And this is my buddy Mark.

11:51.162 --> 11:52.773
- Nice to meet you.
- Good friends of mine.

11:52.797 --> 11:55.664
In fact, the only friends
I kept from my old life.

11:55.700 --> 11:57.433
You must be Saffron.

11:57.468 --> 12:00.002
My beautiful pain in the...
I mean, my sister Gina.

12:00.038 --> 12:01.437
Hi. Nice to meet you.

12:01.472 --> 12:03.005
- Come here.
- Hi.

12:03.041 --> 12:04.573
Look at you.

12:04.609 --> 12:06.609
You are just as stunning as he said.

12:06.644 --> 12:07.910
- Thank you.
- Come on.

12:07.945 --> 12:09.578
You're giving up the goods now.

12:09.614 --> 12:12.181
And this beautiful young lady
here is my Auntie Colleen.

12:12.216 --> 12:14.150
Auntie, this is my friend Saffron.

12:14.185 --> 12:16.786
Hi. Nice to meet you.

12:16.821 --> 12:18.020
Her name is what?

12:18.056 --> 12:20.022
It's Saffron, Auntie, Saffron.

12:21.559 --> 12:22.858
What kind of name is that?

12:26.297 --> 12:27.997
- We should go get a drink.
- Come on.

12:28.032 --> 12:30.072
- Yeah, that sounds good.
- Yeah, let's get a drink.

12:31.335 --> 12:34.170
Let's just keep going, okay?

12:34.205 --> 12:35.504
What about her favorite food?

12:35.540 --> 12:36.772
Lasagna.

12:36.808 --> 12:38.340
- Popcorn.
- PÃ¢té.

12:38.376 --> 12:40.443
- Popcorn?
- Yeah, weird, right?

12:40.478 --> 12:42.222
She used to eat it one at
a time like a little bird.

12:42.246 --> 12:45.381
Put allergic to peanuts
and shellfish up there.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.116
- I don't remember that.
- Are you kidding?

12:47.151 --> 12:49.129
She was, like, terrified
even of being near shellfish.

12:49.153 --> 12:50.786
It was pretty annoying.

12:50.822 --> 12:52.566
Popcorn was really the
only thing that annoyed me.

12:52.590 --> 12:53.801
The only thing? I had, like, 100.

12:53.825 --> 12:55.191
Well, yeah, obviously.

12:55.226 --> 12:56.792
What do you mean, obviously?

12:56.828 --> 12:58.527
That was her M-O, okay?

12:58.563 --> 13:01.464
For you, she was drama and provocation.

13:01.499 --> 13:03.199
For him, she was poise
and sophistication.

13:03.234 --> 13:06.335
For me, she was...
everything I ever needed, I guess.

13:06.370 --> 13:07.870
Please.

13:07.905 --> 13:10.039
All, you guys, come on.
Come on. This is stupid.

13:10.074 --> 13:11.652
How are we supposed to
know what's even real

13:11.676 --> 13:13.220
if she was completely
different with each of us?

13:13.244 --> 13:15.044
We just have to find one
thing that rings true

13:15.079 --> 13:16.679
for all of us, all right?

13:16.714 --> 13:18.647
She... She couldn't have been
faking everything.

13:18.683 --> 13:20.516
Definitely not the sex. That was real.

13:20.551 --> 13:22.284
At least for me, man. She was a freak.

13:22.320 --> 13:24.019
Okay, you know,
I don't want to hear this.

13:24.055 --> 13:26.155
Well, then you definitely
don't want to hear about

13:26.190 --> 13:27.723
the time her and I went to Vegas.

13:27.758 --> 13:29.859
My God, dude.
We met this chick from Zumanity.

13:29.894 --> 13:31.927
That's the one where
they're naked acrobats.

13:31.963 --> 13:33.262
Bro, we were in the elevator,

13:33.297 --> 13:34.817
and she unzips my fly, swear to God...

13:42.773 --> 13:45.407
<i>So she bends over, lifts up her skirt,</i>

13:45.443 --> 13:48.611
- and right as I'm about to...
- That's enough.

13:48.646 --> 13:50.045
So she can talk about shellfish,

13:50.081 --> 13:51.447
but I can't talk about sex?

13:51.482 --> 13:52.759
I thought we were searching
for the truth here.

13:52.783 --> 13:54.216
Well, here's the truth.

13:54.252 --> 13:55.896
Just because you got off
doesn't mean she did.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.219
She got off, sweetheart.

13:57.255 --> 13:58.888
Let me tell you something else.

13:58.923 --> 14:01.056
After you, she was clearly
done playing with toys.

14:01.092 --> 14:02.691
My God. Seriously?

14:02.727 --> 14:03.792
Ready for the D.

14:03.828 --> 14:05.861
- Jesus, both of you, stop it.
- Wow.

14:05.897 --> 14:07.630
What about stories from her past?

14:07.665 --> 14:09.042
Like, did she ever tell you
anything about when she was

14:09.066 --> 14:11.700
a kid, stuff about her childhood?

14:11.736 --> 14:14.036
You know,
I remember a story about a dog.

14:14.071 --> 14:16.739
- A... A bichon.
- A bichon.

14:16.774 --> 14:19.742
Yeah, yeah, she really loved it,
but this one time...

14:19.777 --> 14:21.944
- It ran out of the house...
- And into the snow...

14:21.979 --> 14:23.757
- And the dog was all white...
- So they couldn't find it...

14:23.781 --> 14:25.114
Because snow is white.

14:27.018 --> 14:29.552
- And she was super sad.
- Right, it was gone for days...

14:29.587 --> 14:31.165
- But then it came back...
- Like a miracle.

14:31.189 --> 14:32.559
- Just in time for...
- Winter solstice...

14:32.560 --> 14:33.343
- Christmas.
- Hanukkah.

14:33.344 --> 14:34.663
My God. You guys.

14:34.664 --> 14:36.637
Write it down. Write it down.
Write it down. Write it down.

14:36.661 --> 14:39.600
"She had a dog."

14:42.633 --> 14:46.335
That's sure as shit not helpful.

14:46.370 --> 14:47.403
No, no, no.

14:47.439 --> 14:48.983
See, now you're making
it sound all flaky and...

14:49.007 --> 14:50.940
No, first it was yoga.

14:50.975 --> 14:52.341
Then it was painting.

14:52.377 --> 14:54.343
Then it was building
schools in Cameroon.

14:54.379 --> 14:55.978
Yeah, well, hold on. Hold on. Wait.

14:56.014 --> 14:57.792
Are you really gonna give me
shit about building schools?

14:57.816 --> 14:59.348
Tough crowd, man.

14:59.384 --> 15:01.250
Thank you. See, she gets it.

15:01.286 --> 15:02.585
I'm finding my passion.

15:02.620 --> 15:04.215
I'm on a journey here.

15:04.489 --> 15:05.888
Leave me alone.

15:05.924 --> 15:07.223
Okay, fine.

15:07.258 --> 15:09.358
You can go eat-pray-love yourself.

15:09.394 --> 15:12.328
I am going to just drink your wine.

15:12.363 --> 15:15.298
Sorry. His latest thing is wine.

15:15.333 --> 15:17.300
See, now, that's not true.
That's not even true.

15:17.335 --> 15:19.179
I've always been into wine.
What are you talking about?

15:19.203 --> 15:20.481
Patrick, a year ago,
you didn't know the difference

15:20.505 --> 15:22.138
between a Merlot and a mermaid.

15:22.173 --> 15:24.740
Now all of a sudden he's
buying vineyards in Oregon.

15:24.776 --> 15:26.420
Yeah, and we're making
some elegant pinots,

15:26.444 --> 15:28.444
- I should say.
- My God.

15:30.114 --> 15:31.659
Yeah, I don't mind a pinot now and then,

15:31.683 --> 15:34.517
but I've always been more
of a cab girl myself.

15:34.552 --> 15:37.219
They're just as complex as a pinot

15:37.255 --> 15:40.723
but not as delicate and fussy.

15:41.926 --> 15:44.160
You say fussy.

15:44.195 --> 15:46.653
I say sophisticated.

15:49.901 --> 15:52.535
You know, the thing about cabs,

15:52.570 --> 15:55.705
they're the most adaptable of vines.

15:55.740 --> 15:57.117
You can plant them just about anywhere,

15:57.141 --> 15:58.607
and as long as you tend it,

15:58.643 --> 16:01.277
they'll always give you
something beautiful.

16:01.312 --> 16:03.679
We're still talking about wine, right?

16:03.715 --> 16:05.012
Hear, hear.

16:06.417 --> 16:09.251
Anybody ever tell you there's
sort of a mystery to you?

16:10.888 --> 16:14.757
Like, how do you know
so much about wine?

16:14.792 --> 16:17.026
Not very mysterious, really.

16:17.061 --> 16:20.730
When you work in a restaurant,
you learn about wine.

16:20.765 --> 16:23.199
I can see why he likes you.

16:25.803 --> 16:29.138
There's something about him.

16:29.173 --> 16:33.142
I don't know. It's just... easy.

16:35.246 --> 16:36.879
Maybe it's too easy.

16:36.914 --> 16:39.081
Is this something he does,

16:39.117 --> 16:42.885
bring the new girl to the barbecue?

16:42.920 --> 16:44.220
Is my brother a player?

16:44.255 --> 16:46.956
Is that what you're asking me?

16:46.991 --> 16:48.758
Hey, a girl has to wonder.

16:48.793 --> 16:51.727
Look, if you had asked me that
a year ago,

16:51.763 --> 16:53.963
he's just... he's been through a lot.

16:53.998 --> 16:55.765
I mean, we all have.

16:55.800 --> 16:59.535
I don't know how much he's told you,
but he's changed.

17:00.872 --> 17:02.304
I think he's into you.

17:04.375 --> 17:06.976
And for once, I approve.

17:50.021 --> 17:51.353
Are you lost?

17:54.725 --> 17:56.392
Such a big house.

17:56.427 --> 17:59.562
Listen to me...

17:59.597 --> 18:02.164
whatever your name is.

18:02.200 --> 18:05.468
My nephew is a really fine young man.

18:05.503 --> 18:09.572
But he doesn't know people,
not the way I do.

18:40.089 --> 18:41.228
Viv.

18:44.527 --> 18:45.793
Mr. Heller.

18:45.829 --> 18:48.296
You scare me.

18:48.331 --> 18:49.730
I listen to podcast.

18:49.766 --> 18:51.766
I finish now.

18:51.801 --> 18:56.237
Sorry, I just...
Well, I wanted your opinion.

18:56.272 --> 18:59.507
I see.

18:59.542 --> 19:03.344
For business or... something else maybe?

19:03.379 --> 19:04.612
Something else maybe.

19:04.647 --> 19:06.113
Wonderful.

19:06.149 --> 19:08.649
The same woman as before?

19:08.685 --> 19:11.485
I can see you like her, this one, yes?

19:11.521 --> 19:14.155
People think she's a certain way,

19:14.190 --> 19:17.758
but she's got something.

19:17.794 --> 19:22.463
Mr. Heller, you stop my heart.

19:22.498 --> 19:25.466
This one here.

19:25.501 --> 19:27.168
Yes.

19:27.203 --> 19:28.970
<i>I'm glad to make a new friend, Saffron.</i>

19:29.005 --> 19:30.438
Same here.

19:30.473 --> 19:31.939
Yeah.

19:31.975 --> 19:33.608
- I'll call you later.
- You better.

19:33.643 --> 19:36.110
Hey, it was so nice to meet you.

19:36.145 --> 19:37.389
All right, Auntie, you ready to go?

19:37.413 --> 19:39.280
- Yes.
- Bye, y'all.

19:39.315 --> 19:41.048
I am not an invalid, Gina.

19:41.084 --> 19:42.483
- Stop...
- Okay, all right.

19:43.441 --> 19:44.218
Love you, guys.

19:44.254 --> 19:45.886
Love you.

19:49.259 --> 19:52.360
Yeah, Auntie does not like me at all.

19:52.395 --> 19:54.695
Don't feel special.
She doesn't like anybody.

19:54.731 --> 19:57.064
- Yeah.
- Mean old lady.

20:03.406 --> 20:07.008
Yeah, she's just been
having a hard time lately.

20:07.043 --> 20:12.213
Lost her sister recently, my mom.

20:12.248 --> 20:14.081
I'm so sorry, Patrick.

20:14.117 --> 20:15.516
Yeah.

20:15.551 --> 20:17.818
I love this song.

20:41.577 --> 20:43.911
So what about your family?

20:43.947 --> 20:45.525
Your folks?

20:47.917 --> 20:49.951
Not much to tell.

20:49.986 --> 20:53.587
You know, pretty boring suburban family.

20:53.623 --> 20:55.890
Yeah, are you close with them?

20:55.925 --> 20:59.093
I was once.

20:59.128 --> 21:02.396
I don't really see them much anymore.

21:03.678 --> 21:05.232
Kind of complicated.

21:05.268 --> 21:08.769
Yeah, family is always complicated.

21:10.173 --> 21:15.142
Do you find most things complicated?

21:17.113 --> 21:19.714
Usually.

21:19.749 --> 21:21.582
Yeah.

21:21.617 --> 21:26.754
Me, I think that some
things can be pretty simple.

21:45.641 --> 21:47.641
What?

21:50.613 --> 21:53.514
Don't say what I think
you're about to say.

21:53.549 --> 21:55.063
No, please don't.

21:55.985 --> 21:58.753
It's just... I... I'm sorry.

21:58.788 --> 22:01.522
I just can't right now.

22:01.557 --> 22:03.491
Listen, I spent
the better part of my life

22:03.526 --> 22:05.626
pushing good things away.

22:05.661 --> 22:08.662
I don't want to live like that anymore.

22:08.698 --> 22:13.801
All you have to do is be
open to possibilities.

22:13.836 --> 22:16.003
I am...

22:16.039 --> 22:18.005
open to the possibility

22:18.041 --> 22:21.609
of being your friend.

22:24.313 --> 22:28.716
Well... no, I can...
I can live with that.

22:28.751 --> 22:30.518
I can live with that.

22:30.553 --> 22:32.286
Hey, how about you stay for dinner?

22:32.321 --> 22:35.990
We order in, keep it simple...
as friends, obviously.

22:36.025 --> 22:37.058
What time is it?

22:37.093 --> 22:38.225
Um...

22:38.261 --> 22:39.660
Shit.

22:39.695 --> 22:41.862
I'm sorry, I-I-I lost track of time.

22:41.898 --> 22:43.330
I'm so sorry.

22:43.366 --> 22:45.366
I've got to go. I'll see you, um...

22:45.401 --> 22:46.734
Sunday.

22:46.769 --> 22:48.536
Yeah.

23:14.530 --> 23:16.063
In here.

23:16.099 --> 23:17.731
Hey.

23:17.767 --> 23:20.034
So sorry I'm late.

23:20.069 --> 23:22.236
You won't believe what happened.

23:22.271 --> 23:24.905
My neighbor had a massive
fire in her kitchen,

23:24.941 --> 23:28.576
like, a real fire,
and her cat just had five kittens,

23:28.611 --> 23:30.244
and she couldn't find them all.

23:30.279 --> 23:33.214
I mean, what was I gonna do,
not help her find the kittens?

23:33.249 --> 23:35.060
And my phone had died,
and that's why I couldn't call.

23:35.084 --> 23:37.918
Anyways, how are you?

23:37.954 --> 23:40.721
I am much better now that you're here.

23:40.756 --> 23:44.258
Wow, and what a special place this is.

23:44.293 --> 23:48.362
Well, as we have to be discreet, right?

23:48.397 --> 23:52.133
Of course. We have lots of work to do.

23:52.168 --> 23:54.768
- Wine?
- Yes, please.

23:54.804 --> 23:55.870
Thank you.

24:32.842 --> 24:34.953
And that's when I decided to
have my gallbladder removed.

24:34.977 --> 24:37.178
You know, the organ
that helps the body digest fat.

24:37.213 --> 24:38.913
Yeah, I heard all about it on "Dr. Oz."

24:38.948 --> 24:41.315
It's not a vital organ, though.

24:41.350 --> 24:43.984
Runs in my family,
these gallbladder issues.

24:44.020 --> 24:45.986
Wow, what else
were you gonna do? I mean...

24:46.022 --> 24:47.121
It's genetic.

24:47.156 --> 24:48.689
Right?

24:48.724 --> 24:49.724
Jinx.

24:53.396 --> 24:56.197
You know, this is... it's really nice.

24:56.232 --> 24:58.966
Just being able to sit and talk.

25:00.369 --> 25:02.169
It's rare.

25:02.205 --> 25:04.349
It's really... it's rare, but,
you know, when it happens,

25:04.373 --> 25:06.240
it's... it's really special.

25:08.978 --> 25:11.879
Heh, of course, well...

25:40.343 --> 25:41.709
Saffron.

25:41.744 --> 25:43.577
Do you not like your moo shu?

25:46.449 --> 25:48.449
I love it.

26:06.919 --> 26:08.452
Hi.

26:08.488 --> 26:11.288
Oban, please. Neat.

26:17.797 --> 26:20.931
I'm guessing Toledo

26:20.967 --> 26:23.734
or Columbus maybe.

26:23.770 --> 26:25.603
But it's Ohio somewhere.

26:25.942 --> 26:27.138
Close, Saint Louis.

26:27.173 --> 26:31.909
See, I am... I am good at this.

26:31.944 --> 26:33.244
Put hers on mine, please.

26:33.279 --> 26:35.246
That's... that's not necessary.

26:38.468 --> 26:40.446
You know, the hardest thing
about being on the road,

26:40.470 --> 26:42.837
you feel like you never
get to be hospitable.

26:42.872 --> 26:45.339
And it starts to make you
feel like less of a person.

26:45.375 --> 26:48.609
So from one fellow traveler
to another?

26:49.979 --> 26:51.412
Well, thanks.

26:51.447 --> 26:53.748
Yeah.

26:59.289 --> 27:00.955
I'm Max.

27:00.990 --> 27:02.990
Geraldine.

27:03.026 --> 27:06.761
So this is my son Peter.

27:06.796 --> 27:09.830
And this is Stephanie.

27:09.866 --> 27:10.998
She's the youngest.

27:11.034 --> 27:12.433
They look like great kids.

27:12.468 --> 27:14.135
They're pains in my friggin' ass.

27:14.170 --> 27:16.070
But God, I love 'em.

27:17.807 --> 27:20.341
So how about you? You got any kids?

27:20.376 --> 27:21.709
I had a dog once.

27:21.744 --> 27:23.978
Well...

27:24.013 --> 27:26.280
No, I just never settled down.

27:26.316 --> 27:30.451
I could have a few times,
but something always took me away.

27:30.486 --> 27:33.654
It's too late now, you know?

27:33.690 --> 27:37.124
You know, I saw this mug
the other day in the...

27:37.160 --> 27:40.294
the Newark airport gift shop.

27:40.330 --> 27:42.196
You know what it said?

27:42.231 --> 27:45.900
It said "If you wanted to,
you would have done it."

27:45.935 --> 27:49.303
And I just thought, "Yes,
that's right," you know.

27:49.339 --> 27:52.506
I mean, when it comes down to it,
we all choose the life

27:52.542 --> 27:55.142
that we want.

27:55.178 --> 28:00.581
I mean, even if it isn't
the life we say we want.

28:00.616 --> 28:01.582
Did you buy the mug?

28:01.617 --> 28:03.718
I shoulda.

28:09.859 --> 28:12.393
So this is actually the 4.6-liter.

28:12.428 --> 28:16.163
I had the 3.5, but this takes
my horsepower from 350 to 386.

28:16.199 --> 28:18.699
And, you know, I kind of
thought about it, but I thought,

28:18.735 --> 28:21.869
sometimes you just,
you know, you've got to...

28:21.904 --> 28:23.070
You got to go for it.

28:23.106 --> 28:25.439
Absolutely.

28:25.475 --> 28:28.542
Sometimes you just have
to splurge, you know,

28:28.578 --> 28:30.644
go with what feels right.

28:42.792 --> 28:45.559
Gary...

28:45.595 --> 28:47.228
- No.
- Thank you so much

28:47.263 --> 28:50.131
for a... such a wonderful evening.

28:50.166 --> 28:51.732
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that.

28:51.768 --> 28:54.268
- I didn't...
- No, no, it's not you.

28:54.303 --> 28:56.404
You're perfect. It's just... it's me.

28:56.439 --> 28:58.606
I... I don't want to rush things.

28:58.641 --> 29:00.321
- Can I walk you to the door?
- Good night.

29:13.156 --> 29:14.422
Shit.

29:29.038 --> 29:32.473
I miss you.

29:37.814 --> 29:40.130
- Alice...
- Don't give up, sweetheart.

29:40.636 --> 29:42.203
Remember what I used to say?

29:42.238 --> 29:43.537
Yeah.

29:43.573 --> 29:45.439
You said that we could do anything,

29:45.475 --> 29:48.843
And we will,

29:48.878 --> 29:51.045
everything we've always dreamed of.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.847
Yeah.

29:52.882 --> 29:55.216
Tell me the plan again.

29:55.251 --> 29:59.120
I love it when you talk about the plan.

29:59.155 --> 30:03.190
All right, phase one:

30:03.226 --> 30:05.760
You're not just a car salesman.

30:05.795 --> 30:08.696
You're the face of the dealership.

30:08.731 --> 30:11.732
You do all the commercials.

30:11.768 --> 30:12.900
I love phase one.

30:14.303 --> 30:19.473
You run for state senate.

30:19.509 --> 30:22.576
State senate sucks.

30:22.612 --> 30:26.680
You make powerful friends.

30:26.716 --> 30:29.984
Okay, fancy dinners.

30:30.019 --> 30:31.485
I look good in a tux.

30:31.521 --> 30:34.221
Yeah, you do.

30:34.257 --> 30:37.625
Phase four:

30:37.660 --> 30:40.428
You run for the real senate.

30:42.131 --> 30:46.066
Senator and Mrs. Richard Evans.

30:46.102 --> 30:47.290
That's right.

30:50.940 --> 30:54.308
But I can't do any of it without you.

30:54.343 --> 30:56.321
I mean, we were that couple
that everyone looked at

30:56.345 --> 31:00.014
and was just like, "Damn."

31:01.884 --> 31:04.285
Why can't it be like that again?

31:04.320 --> 31:05.986
It can.

31:06.022 --> 31:09.089
You're going to find me.

31:09.125 --> 31:12.193
Just have to keep looking.

31:12.228 --> 31:14.595
And I promise you will.

31:16.466 --> 31:19.300
I know...

31:19.335 --> 31:21.368
We've got cheesesteaks.

31:24.340 --> 31:26.373
I'm not hungry.

31:26.409 --> 31:28.709
What the hell was that?

31:28.744 --> 31:29.744
He's gluten-free?

31:43.720 --> 31:45.633
Let me ask you a question.

31:47.290 --> 31:51.759
CeCe, Ava, Alice.

31:54.264 --> 31:57.899
You ever thought about killing her?

31:57.934 --> 31:59.934
I have.

31:59.969 --> 32:01.570
I've thought about it.

32:03.406 --> 32:07.041
Before, I never understood how someone

32:07.077 --> 32:11.279
could kill another person,
like, take away their life.

32:11.314 --> 32:14.315
But now...

32:16.953 --> 32:21.889
My therapist, he says
we're attracted to people

32:21.925 --> 32:24.258
not just because of the
good things about them

32:24.294 --> 32:27.628
but also because of their pain.

32:27.664 --> 32:33.067
Like, my pain
is attracted to their pain.

32:33.103 --> 32:38.372
Do you think she feels pain at all?

32:38.408 --> 32:42.143
Like, if this is what you do,
and if this is your thing,

32:42.178 --> 32:45.680
conning people into loving you,
what does that do to you?

32:49.953 --> 32:53.488
I still don't understand how
someone can make you love them

32:53.523 --> 32:58.259
and then just walk away
like it was nothing.

32:58.294 --> 33:00.928
How do you do that?

33:00.964 --> 33:02.439
I don't know.

33:04.601 --> 33:06.267
But you know what all the con books say?

33:06.302 --> 33:08.903
For a successful con,

33:08.938 --> 33:12.273
you need a willing mark.

33:12.308 --> 33:15.199
We wanted every single lie she told us.

33:17.780 --> 33:22.950
But I have to believe someday
it's gonna catch up to her.

33:26.322 --> 33:27.615
Yeah.

34:19.876 --> 34:21.542
Jesus.

34:22.039 --> 34:24.203
Yes, I intercepted Heller's
courier last night,

34:24.237 --> 34:25.045
and you were right.

34:25.081 --> 34:26.880
<i>That bastard was taking
way more than his cut.</i>

34:26.917 --> 34:29.717
The launderer has been
stealing the laundry.

34:29.753 --> 34:31.719
<i>Looks exactly as you suspected, yes.</i>

34:31.755 --> 34:33.087
For how long?

34:33.123 --> 34:35.590
Best I can tell, almost two years.

34:35.625 --> 34:37.792
<i>He could have skimmed close
to 2 million from you.</i>

34:40.630 --> 34:42.297
Scorched earth mode, Max.

34:42.331 --> 34:44.766
<i>We get the 2 million back.</i>

34:44.801 --> 34:46.467
<i>We take everything he's ever had.</i>

34:46.503 --> 34:47.969
<i>We destroy him.</i>

34:48.004 --> 34:49.103
Yes.

34:49.139 --> 34:50.705
<i>Yes, Doctor.</i>

34:50.739 --> 34:54.042
I have a concern about Maddie.

34:54.077 --> 34:57.011
Is she getting distracted?

34:57.549 --> 34:58.749
No, I've got it under control.

34:58.799 --> 35:01.916
I'm not so sure.

35:01.952 --> 35:03.785
Maybe I need to send Lenny Cohen.

35:03.820 --> 35:05.553
No, there's no need for Lenny Cohen.

35:05.588 --> 35:08.222
I... I'll... I'll take care of it.

35:24.975 --> 35:27.575
It's hopeless.

35:27.610 --> 35:30.645
We tried. We really did.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.014
No, we didn't.

35:34.383 --> 35:36.884
But if we give up now, we suck.

35:36.952 --> 35:37.518
You know what I think?

35:37.586 --> 35:39.387
I think our lives
are like a murder scene.

35:39.388 --> 35:42.727
Perfectly cleaned up.
No clues left behind.

35:42.993 --> 35:44.592
We need that stuff.

35:44.627 --> 35:46.160
What's that stuff that the police use

35:46.196 --> 35:47.462
to see where the blood was?

35:47.497 --> 35:48.763
Luminol.

35:48.798 --> 35:50.631
Yes, we need some Luminol up in here.

35:50.667 --> 35:52.667
Maybe it's better this way.

35:52.702 --> 35:54.268
At least now she can't destroy us

35:54.304 --> 35:57.472
with all her inside information.

35:57.507 --> 35:59.440
What are you talking about?

35:59.476 --> 36:01.476
The envelope she left in the freezer

36:01.511 --> 36:02.977
after the good-bye video.

36:03.013 --> 36:06.647
She left me an envelope
with information in it.

36:06.683 --> 36:09.517
Bad stuff you'd never want anyone to...

36:09.552 --> 36:11.185
Why are you looking
at me like I'm crazy?

36:11.221 --> 36:13.488
I have literally no idea
what you're talking about.

36:13.523 --> 36:14.627
Yeah, me neither.

36:14.628 --> 36:18.092
You guys are so full of...
I bet whatever's in your folder

36:18.128 --> 36:19.494
is way worse than what's in mine.

36:19.529 --> 36:21.229
Yeah, man, who gives a damn?

36:21.264 --> 36:23.197
It's all in the past, right?

36:23.233 --> 36:25.566
- Never backwards.
- Always forward.

36:27.203 --> 36:29.037
That's what she'd say to me in French

36:29.072 --> 36:30.905
when I was bummed out about work.

36:33.910 --> 36:35.988
She's say that to me when I
had a fight with my family.

36:36.012 --> 36:37.656
I put a little bit of
weight on over the holidays.

36:37.680 --> 36:39.714
I'd beat myself up,
and she would say it to me.

36:39.749 --> 36:41.049
Hey, could that mean something?

36:41.084 --> 36:42.917
I don't know. It's just a saying.

36:42.952 --> 36:44.519
Yeah, maybe like a fortune cookie or...

36:44.554 --> 36:46.687
Yeah, no, but it's a...
what do you call it, a... a...

36:46.723 --> 36:48.189
- A motto.
- Yeah.

36:48.224 --> 36:50.625
Yeah.

36:52.562 --> 36:55.163
Looks like it's a translation
of a Latin phrase.

36:55.198 --> 36:56.638
Hey, man, what's the Wi-Fi password?

36:58.735 --> 37:00.279
- Could you spell that for me?
- Check it out.

37:00.303 --> 37:01.836
It is a motto...

37:01.871 --> 37:03.237
Never mind. I'm on.

37:03.273 --> 37:05.873
For five high schools
plus a Jesuit seminary

37:05.909 --> 37:07.909
and a soup kitchen in Nova Scotia.

37:07.944 --> 37:10.711
Guys, what if one of these
places was her school?

37:10.747 --> 37:13.081
That would be huge,
man, track down her roots?

37:13.116 --> 37:14.382
How do we narrow this down?

37:14.417 --> 37:15.861
Well, two of these are all-boy schools,

37:15.885 --> 37:17.952
so we can scratch those off.

37:17.987 --> 37:21.389
I mean, I think we can all agree
she's always been a girl, right?

37:27.063 --> 37:28.441
And here.
This one wasn't even founded

37:28.465 --> 37:29.430
until three years ago.

37:29.466 --> 37:30.765
So that just leaves...

37:30.800 --> 37:33.101
Three schools, one in Texas,
one in Florida,

37:33.136 --> 37:34.235
and one in Pennsylvania.

37:34.270 --> 37:35.703
That's still too many.

37:35.738 --> 37:37.305
Holy shit.

37:37.340 --> 37:38.739
- Guys, Panther.
- What?

37:38.775 --> 37:40.908
St. Agnes Academy in Pottsville,
Pennsylvania.

37:40.944 --> 37:42.243
Their mascot is a Panther.

37:42.278 --> 37:43.911
So?

37:43.947 --> 37:45.658
That was her name for me.
She used to call me Panther.

37:45.682 --> 37:47.493
- No, she didn't.
- No, no, hey, she did, okay?

37:47.517 --> 37:48.994
I don't mean to offend you guys,
because I know you're both

37:49.018 --> 37:50.318
total freakin' prudes, but yes,

37:50.353 --> 37:52.253
we had names for each other when we...

37:52.288 --> 37:53.421
Dude, we get it.

37:53.456 --> 37:55.389
You guys had great sex.

37:55.425 --> 37:57.725
We're not going to a place
called Pottsville for that.

37:57.760 --> 37:58.819
Okay.

38:00.797 --> 38:02.230
F...

38:02.265 --> 38:03.631
Wait a minute.

38:03.666 --> 38:06.067
In the dog story, the one she told us,

38:06.102 --> 38:08.636
in all three versions, it was winter.

38:08.671 --> 38:09.746
So?

38:11.341 --> 38:13.508
My God. You're right.

38:13.543 --> 38:14.809
What?

38:14.844 --> 38:16.410
The dog gets lost in the snow.

38:16.446 --> 38:18.813
- Yeah.
- In the snow. Think about it.

38:18.848 --> 38:20.448
- Texas...
- Florida...

38:20.483 --> 38:22.316
Pennsylvania.

38:22.352 --> 38:23.629
Pennsylvania. That's what...
That's what I'm saying.

38:23.653 --> 38:25.019
The Panthers are in Pennsylvania.

38:25.054 --> 38:26.120
Pottsville, here we come.

38:26.156 --> 38:27.355
- Yes!
- Yes!

38:27.390 --> 38:29.323
Good job, guys. Good job.

38:35.166 --> 38:36.706
Where is Pottsville?

38:36.741 --> 38:38.103
About an hour away from Philadelphia.

38:38.127 --> 38:39.771
- We set off now, we'll be there...
- No, no, no, no, no.

38:39.795 --> 38:42.884
- Seriously? Another one?
- It's alternate odd-number

38:42.920 --> 38:45.086
- side-street Thursday.
- Come on. Please?

38:45.122 --> 38:46.855
- It's already Thursday?
- Come on.

38:46.890 --> 38:48.009
Shit, man.

38:48.010 --> 38:49.636
We still got to get the
keys out of the car.

38:49.660 --> 38:50.841
Hey, what about a coat hanger?

38:50.842 --> 38:52.527
No, we're not using a coat hanger.

38:52.562 --> 38:54.195
Yeah, dude, I read a book about it.

38:54.231 --> 38:55.875
Dude, you unbend it,
and then you slip it down...

38:55.899 --> 38:57.499
Coat hanger your own car.
Absolutely not.

38:57.534 --> 38:59.768
You slip it down... I don't have a car!

38:59.803 --> 39:01.870
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

39:01.905 --> 39:05.040
What in... Are... This is my car.

39:05.075 --> 39:06.875
And now it's unlocked.

39:06.910 --> 39:09.077
Are you crazy?

39:09.112 --> 39:11.479
My God.

39:11.515 --> 39:13.314
Did you see what she did?

39:13.350 --> 39:15.950
Richard, I've waited two years for this.

39:15.986 --> 39:17.385
We're not wasting any more time.

39:17.421 --> 39:19.187
Now, get in the goddamn car.

39:21.224 --> 39:22.857
My God.

39:22.893 --> 39:26.027
No further damage to personal property.

39:26.063 --> 39:27.962
You guys were serious
about having a code?

39:27.998 --> 39:29.664
It's real. You're sitting on it.

39:29.700 --> 39:32.300
No sitting on the code.

39:32.335 --> 39:33.968
What are you gonna put it under glass

39:34.004 --> 39:35.403
at the National Archives?

39:35.439 --> 39:38.139
Can we just have some quiet, please?

39:38.175 --> 39:41.009
<i>Here we go.</i>

40:04.101 --> 40:06.034
From the guy over there.

40:08.582 --> 40:09.714
No, thanks.

40:11.418 --> 40:13.018
Come on, gorgeous.

40:13.788 --> 40:16.021
Oblige me.

40:16.056 --> 40:18.423
Makes me feel like I'm
not drinking alone.

40:18.458 --> 40:20.659
Maybe you should find some friends.

40:20.694 --> 40:23.328
Let's you and me be friends?

40:23.363 --> 40:25.764
What's your name, sweetheart?

40:25.799 --> 40:28.166
I bet you've got a pretty name.

40:28.201 --> 40:31.770
Go back, sit down,
and mind your own business.

40:34.441 --> 40:36.308
What you gonna do if I don't?

40:45.552 --> 40:47.719
The name's Lenny Cohen.

40:53.527 --> 40:55.093
You bitch!

40:55.128 --> 40:57.696
Get back here!

40:57.831 --> 40:58.897
Get back here!

40:59.498 --> 41:05.498
