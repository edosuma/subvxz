01:35.469 --> 01:37.594
Hey, look out!

01:42.227 --> 01:43.186
Brace face!

02:12.132 --> 02:13.800
I have your favorite.

02:15.300 --> 02:20.304
Lemonade!

02:20.306 --> 02:22.264
I made it just the way
you like it,

02:22.266 --> 02:24.561
with a hint of cinnamon!

02:32.110 --> 02:33.611
Is something wrong, dear?

02:35.405 --> 02:36.531
Are you well?

02:38.032 --> 02:40.240
I'm fine, sugar bear, I just.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.664
I just witnessed that boy
chastise baby girl again.

02:49.461 --> 02:50.253
Oh.

02:55.383 --> 02:58.050
Oh, my goodness, Mother.

02:58.052 --> 02:59.888
You have outdone
yourself this time.

04:52.791 --> 04:56.418
Now, soon as you are done
with your lunch, baby girl,

04:56.420 --> 04:58.380
you can pick up a few
things at the market.

04:59.882 --> 05:04.887
A loaf of bread, stick a
butter, and a gallon of milk.

07:25.487 --> 07:26.528
Jesus Christ.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.490
Told you she was a freak.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.620
My brother says you're
the new kid in school.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.415
Never seen you ride the bus.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.582
You must ride the short bus.

07:46.548 --> 07:47.966
Where are your shoes?

07:50.427 --> 07:51.512
Dirty ass feet.

07:53.598 --> 07:54.891
Ugly bitch.

07:56.642 --> 07:59.476
Can you get to Mars
with that thing?

07:59.478 --> 08:04.606
Ugly bitch.

08:04.608 --> 08:06.651
You given me eyes?

08:06.653 --> 08:08.319
Ugly bitch.

08:10.865 --> 08:11.824
You gonna cry?

08:17.663 --> 08:19.788
What's that?

08:28.632 --> 08:33.219
Oh, diddums, did you fall
down and go boom-boom?

08:33.221 --> 08:34.471
Ha, diddums!

09:02.207 --> 09:03.999
Ah!

09:46.669 --> 09:50.754
You're
listening to KIL 98.5 Radio.

09:50.756 --> 09:53.757
Sad news just came
across my desk right now.

09:53.759 --> 09:56.219
Earlier today in Killsoma Park,

09:56.221 --> 09:58.805
two teenagers were found dead.

09:58.807 --> 10:00.848
Names have not been
released to the public

10:00.850 --> 10:03.519
until family members
have been notified.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.438
Authorities have stated there
is possibly a wild animal

10:07.440 --> 10:09.107
on the loose
and are warning folks

10:09.109 --> 10:12.193
that it is in their best
interest to stay

10:12.195 --> 10:15.405
inside their homes until
the animal is contained.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.989
Now, back to our regularly
scheduled program.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.168
Somebody's had a
busy day today.

10:30.754 --> 10:33.091
It looks like Father put
your gear back together.

10:34.466 --> 10:40.137
He's always been so good
at fixing things.

10:40.139 --> 10:45.144
Those mean children won't
hurt you or anybody again.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.564
It's a shame what happened.

10:49.857 --> 10:51.859
I wonder what sort of
animal it was?

10:56.155 --> 10:58.032
Tomorrow's a new day.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.860
Have I told you how
much I love you?

11:35.153 --> 11:36.571
Yes, you have.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.490
I know what you did.

11:41.701 --> 11:42.494
Huh?

11:44.788 --> 11:46.413
Don't be coy.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.542
I know what you
did for princess.

11:53.421 --> 11:55.757
With that little
screwdriver of yours.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.929
You've always taken
charge of situations.

12:03.889 --> 12:08.352
Those children had it coming
to them and you took charge.

12:09.312 --> 12:11.230
I saw you the other
night in her room,

12:13.191 --> 12:16.235
how you fixed her head piece.

12:23.701 --> 12:24.785
She's our baby.

12:26.495 --> 12:27.911
Yes.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.374
And you took care of her.

12:32.293 --> 12:37.298
Situations like this
make me feel frisky.

14:50.222 --> 14:52.307
It's his first day.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.061
It's his first day.

14:56.980 --> 14:58.271
Oh.

14:58.273 --> 14:59.065
Thank you.

15:06.990 --> 15:10.157
They don't see too many
new faces around here.

15:10.159 --> 15:14.121
You know, small town,
everybody knows everybody.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.708
Ah, hot.

15:18.710 --> 15:19.836
And strong.

15:20.378 --> 15:22.878
I'm Abby.

15:22.880 --> 15:23.673
Peter.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.465
Peter, you drink
coffee all day

15:26.467 --> 15:29.051
or can I get you
something to eat?

15:29.053 --> 15:30.096
Oh.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.016
What's good?

15:35.018 --> 15:37.185
You look like a savory
kind of guy.

15:37.187 --> 15:39.896
The Eggs Benny's great.

15:39.898 --> 15:41.189
Okay.

15:41.191 --> 15:42.567
Eggs Benedict.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.726
Here you go.

16:18.937 --> 16:20.228
Thank you.

16:20.230 --> 16:21.688
Can I get you anything else?

16:21.690 --> 16:22.482
No.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.925
Can you.

17:34.304 --> 17:36.304
Can you tell me how to get here?

17:36.306 --> 17:38.305
Yeah.

21:31.124 --> 21:32.500
Sam, I need you.

22:07.618 --> 22:08.410
Peter.

22:10.622 --> 22:13.413
Hey.

22:21.633 --> 22:23.884
Sam was always such a nice guy.

22:26.471 --> 22:28.930
We were in the army together.

22:28.932 --> 22:30.974
Stationed over in Europe.

22:32.394 --> 22:34.561
I haven't seen him
in a long time.

22:37.523 --> 22:42.151
Sounds like you two
are really close.

22:42.153 --> 22:42.945
We are.

22:49.911 --> 22:53.537
I'm working the afternoon
shift at the diner.

22:53.539 --> 22:57.040
Maybe I could buy you dinner.

22:57.042 --> 22:59.169
I appreciate that, but
I'm not a charity case.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.464
I didn't mean
anything by that.

23:07.220 --> 23:10.638
Well, if you change your mind
and you need

23:10.640 --> 23:12.976
somebody to talk to, I'm here.

23:14.309 --> 23:15.686
Thank you, Abby.

23:17.689 --> 23:19.858
I don't do that very well.

23:23.737 --> 23:24.528
Okay.

23:29.451 --> 23:30.701
Take care, Peter.

23:38.876 --> 23:39.668
Bye.

23:41.086 --> 23:41.879
Abby.

23:52.557 --> 24:04.691
Finally.

24:04.693 --> 24:06.026
Coffee.

24:06.028 --> 24:07.238
Have a seat.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.942
I didn't think I'd
see you again.

24:45.609 --> 24:51.698
You don't belong here, Peter.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.535
I didn't know where
else to go.

24:55.662 --> 24:58.955
You don't know what it's like.

24:58.957 --> 25:01.209
I don't know what it's like?

25:02.001 --> 25:06.254
Throwing up all the time,
shaking and trembling

25:06.256 --> 25:09.172
so bad I can barely
get up off the floor.

25:09.174 --> 25:10.466
Sorry, Sam.

25:10.468 --> 25:11.510
I know.

25:13.346 --> 25:16.057
I just didn't know
who else to turn to.

25:18.643 --> 25:21.730
I can't do this alone.

25:23.565 --> 25:25.650
You are alone, Peter.

25:29.237 --> 25:34.157
What do I do?

25:34.159 --> 25:36.453
It's making me so sick.

25:37.996 --> 25:39.873
I don't know how to stop.

25:43.625 --> 25:49.838
The only way to
stop is to end it.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.467
There's no more help.

25:52.801 --> 25:56.347
You have to let it go.

26:00.518 --> 26:01.310
How?

26:05.898 --> 26:08.399
You want help,

26:08.401 --> 26:10.942
you need to be ready.

26:10.944 --> 26:15.950
You need to accept what
it is and deal with it.

26:18.536 --> 26:23.541
If you want out you have to do
what I did.

26:26.627 --> 26:28.420
Sam, I need you.

26:31.674 --> 26:32.841
Sam.

26:35.553 --> 26:39.015
Hey, I didn't think
I'd see your face again.

26:42.810 --> 26:44.228
Are you okay?

26:45.689 --> 26:47.023
Yeah.

26:50.359 --> 26:55.365
Do you want something else?

26:55.781 --> 26:57.116
You don't belong here.

27:00.369 --> 27:03.662
Sir, I'm sorry but I don't
know you.

27:03.664 --> 27:05.040
Billy, come on, go sit down.

27:06.209 --> 27:08.584
You have no business at that
boy's house

27:08.586 --> 27:11.504
and you have no goddamn
business being here!

27:11.506 --> 27:13.922
I said, that's enough!

27:15.844 --> 27:17.303
Now, get the hell out of here!

27:19.596 --> 27:20.345
Billy.

27:20.347 --> 27:27.728
Peter, wait!

27:27.730 --> 27:28.938
Peter, wait.

27:28.940 --> 27:31.484
Just stay away from
me, Abby.

27:33.737 --> 27:35.321
Your bag!

27:39.241 --> 27:42.910
You want help?

27:42.912 --> 27:45.662
You need to be ready.

27:45.664 --> 27:52.128
You need to accept what it is
and deal with it.

27:52.922 --> 27:56.507
If you want out

27:56.509 --> 27:59.344
you need to do what I did.

27:59.346 --> 28:04.351
I'm so sorry.

28:05.894 --> 28:06.728
I'm so sorry.

28:49.019 --> 28:51.853
Billy had no right to
talk to him like that.

28:51.855 --> 28:55.650
Sweetheart, Billy is
an old coot.

28:55.652 --> 29:00.071
He doesn't know what to do
with outsiders beyond townies.

29:00.073 --> 29:02.030
Not you, Abby.

29:02.032 --> 29:04.449
You're gonna change this place.

29:04.451 --> 29:06.827
No, I am doing everything in
my power

29:06.829 --> 29:08.830
to get out of here.

29:08.832 --> 29:22.844
Can't escape where you're
from, Marilyn.

29:22.846 --> 29:25.304
You're always so good to me,
Charlene.

29:25.306 --> 29:26.850
Stop sucking up.

29:32.230 --> 29:36.024
Go on, get outta here.

29:36.026 --> 29:37.315
Are you sure?

29:37.317 --> 29:40.361
I don't wanna repeat myself,
go!

29:40.363 --> 29:48.870
Thanks, Charlene.

29:48.872 --> 29:50.582
See you tomorrow?

29:52.000 --> 29:54.917
Be careful out there,
full moon.

29:54.919 --> 29:56.251
Lotta weirdos.

29:56.253 --> 29:58.088
Don't worry about me.

29:58.381 --> 30:00.006
Good girl.

30:00.008 --> 30:02.382
Get outta here.

30:02.384 --> 30:03.177
Good night.

30:14.064 --> 30:15.273
Peter?

30:26.076 --> 30:27.701
Peter?

30:32.582 --> 30:34.292
Hey, I'm sorry about Billy.

30:35.876 --> 30:37.626
You know how old people
are, they're just not

30:37.628 --> 30:51.099
as understanding as they
used to be.

30:51.101 --> 30:52.227
Peter?

31:13.205 --> 31:15.207
Peter, are you okay?

31:33.143 --> 31:34.976
Peter?

33:11.490 --> 33:12.407
Jesus.

33:12.409 --> 33:13.199
Oh my god.

33:13.201 --> 33:13.992
Are you alright?

33:15.744 --> 33:17.621
Yes, yes, I think I
swallowed a bug.

33:18.789 --> 33:20.081
That's okay.

33:20.083 --> 33:21.748
It was just a nightmare.

33:21.750 --> 33:25.253
No, I felt it.

33:25.255 --> 33:26.840
It crawled inside my mouth.

33:27.798 --> 33:29.299
Do you want a glass of water?

33:34.305 --> 33:36.389
Take a sip.

33:36.391 --> 33:37.180
Take a sip.

33:37.182 --> 33:38.308
Are you even listening to me?

33:40.769 --> 33:44.188
A fucking bug crawled
in my mouth.

33:44.190 --> 33:46.149
Just close your eyes
and relax.

33:46.151 --> 33:48.153
You'll fall back asleep.

33:52.406 --> 33:53.780
I can't.

34:19.684 --> 34:20.476
Wow.

34:21.811 --> 34:22.603
Hungry?

34:23.896 --> 34:25.146
Feeding the bug.

34:25.148 --> 34:26.396
What?

34:26.398 --> 34:28.273
The bug that crawled
in my mouth last night.

34:28.275 --> 34:29.483
Stop it.

34:29.485 --> 34:31.693
I have to eat more
because this parasite,

34:31.695 --> 34:34.155
this worm is stealing
all my food.

34:34.157 --> 34:36.239
It's like having the
world's hungriest baby

34:36.242 --> 34:40.536
only instead of a baby
it's a bug, a worm bug.

34:40.538 --> 34:42.621
You're being gross.

34:42.623 --> 34:45.123
You're wasting food.

34:45.126 --> 34:48.795
Besides, don't bugs just eat
other bugs or like crumbs?

34:48.797 --> 34:50.003
I don't know.

34:50.005 --> 34:52.382
All I know is I am hungry and
it's not me.

34:52.384 --> 34:54.132
It's this bug.

34:54.135 --> 34:56.302
It's this worm in my gut.

34:56.304 --> 34:58.262
Ew, you're awful.

34:58.264 --> 34:59.389
Hey, that is my bacon.

34:59.391 --> 35:00.307
Okay, I know.

35:04.144 --> 35:06.396
Do we have a crepe iron?

35:06.398 --> 35:08.398
- No, unh-unh.
- No, alright.

35:29.336 --> 35:31.753
Whoa.

35:31.755 --> 35:33.965
Someone sounds hungry.

35:33.967 --> 35:36.592
Will you shut the fuck up!

35:36.594 --> 35:39.429
Would you please shut
the fuck up

35:39.431 --> 35:41.639
and mind your own fucking
business for fuck sakes?

35:41.641 --> 35:45.351
Fuck you and fuck you!

35:45.353 --> 35:46.146
Fuck!

35:48.981 --> 35:49.773
Fuck!

35:55.320 --> 35:57.449
Someone got up on the
wrong side of the bed.

35:59.284 --> 36:03.911
Excuse me, will you please
shut up?

36:12.422 --> 36:15.007
You can't shit me out.

36:17.552 --> 36:19.217
Excuse me?

36:19.219 --> 36:21.220
It's not going to
work.

36:21.222 --> 36:26.059
I parted your tight, wet,
pink lips and crawled in.

36:26.061 --> 36:28.019
Right the fuck in.

36:28.021 --> 36:30.231
I'm never leaving,
this is my home.

36:41.409 --> 36:42.492
Nice try.

36:42.494 --> 36:43.534
Yeah.

36:43.536 --> 36:45.536
Hilarious.

36:45.538 --> 36:48.539
I literally have no idea
what you're talking about.

36:48.541 --> 36:51.878
You wanna suck my dick, you
just say so, you fucking faggot!

36:55.757 --> 36:56.758
We're concerned.

36:59.135 --> 37:02.222
Have you seen the movie Alien?

37:06.351 --> 37:07.143
Sure.

37:10.396 --> 37:20.320
It's a great film.

37:20.322 --> 37:22.657
I think you need a
few days off.

37:37.590 --> 37:41.175

the middle of the night ♪

37:41.177 --> 37:43.802

rid of me.

Shut up.

38:05.117 --> 38:06.244
Excuse me?

38:07.454 --> 38:08.994
I'm worried about you.

38:08.996 --> 38:10.871
I'm worried about
her ass.

38:10.873 --> 38:11.914
What does that even mean?

38:11.916 --> 38:15.751
It means I'm worried
about you.

38:15.753 --> 38:16.918
It means I'm going
to fuck her

38:16.920 --> 38:19.296
with my little worm dick.

Oh, fuck yeah, eat that bun,
stuff that bun, stuff than bun.

Stop!

39:25.699 --> 39:26.490
Hello.

39:27.574 --> 39:29.450
What?

39:29.452 --> 39:32.869
You didn't get all of
us, there are more inside.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.579
What do you want?

39:34.581 --> 39:37.166
We're hungry, me and my kids.

39:37.168 --> 39:38.793
You're full of us.

39:38.795 --> 39:40.086
I laid eggs.

39:40.088 --> 39:42.588
There's a sack-full sitting
in you waiting to burst.

39:42.590 --> 39:44.257
To feast.

39:44.259 --> 39:46.008
What do I have to do to make
you stop?

39:46.010 --> 39:48.344
We need a big meal.

39:58.398 --> 39:59.604
I can't do this.

39:59.606 --> 40:00.648
You must.

40:00.650 --> 40:02.400
If I do this,
will you shut up?

40:02.402 --> 40:04.151
Then I won't be so
goddamn hungry.

40:04.153 --> 40:05.405
You have my word.

40:11.536 --> 40:12.829
Excuse me, Ma'am.

40:13.829 --> 40:14.954
Yes?

40:14.956 --> 40:19.499
Can you tell what's inside
this bag?

40:29.637 --> 40:30.513
That's easy.

40:55.288 --> 40:57.537
I think we should have a baby.

40:57.539 --> 41:00.041
I thought you thought we
should wait?

41:00.043 --> 41:01.751
No.

41:01.753 --> 41:03.338
I wanna have one.

41:04.838 --> 41:05.840
Like right now.

41:07.007 --> 41:07.800
I love you.

41:09.135 --> 41:10.385
I love you, too.

41:10.387 --> 41:12.097
I love you so much.

41:18.561 --> 41:19.562
Right now.

41:41.041 --> 41:43.291
We should celebrate.

41:43.293 --> 41:44.086
Yeah?

41:45.672 --> 41:46.715
Celebrate what?

41:48.675 --> 41:50.176
Us trying to get pregnant.

41:52.887 --> 41:56.764
I just wanted you to feel it.

41:56.766 --> 41:59.266
Feel what?

41:59.268 --> 42:01.186
Feel what's it's like

42:02.021 --> 42:05.150
to have something
growing inside you.

42:07.527 --> 42:13.613
Taking from you.

42:13.615 --> 42:16.117
That's not funny.

42:16.119 --> 42:17.412
Well, I'm not laughing.

42:22.666 --> 42:25.334
Get out.

42:25.336 --> 42:26.126

You feeling better?

43:36.865 --> 43:38.492
I am actually, yeah.

43:40.369 --> 43:42.537
I'm sorry about last night.

43:42.539 --> 43:43.289
It's okay.

43:44.416 --> 43:45.750
I'm glad your feeling better.

43:47.126 --> 43:49.378
I was thinking we could
go to the farmer's market.

43:51.630 --> 43:52.715
What is this?

43:58.429 --> 44:02.097
What is what?

44:02.099 --> 44:03.682
You're pregnant.

44:03.684 --> 44:05.934
Uh, yeah, stupid.

44:05.936 --> 44:07.353
No, this isn't possible.

44:07.355 --> 44:08.648
We just tried last night.

44:11.192 --> 44:14.235
I've been pregnant for
nearly eight months, I.

44:14.237 --> 44:16.612
You know what, cut it out.

44:16.614 --> 44:17.863
It's too early for this.

44:17.865 --> 44:18.657
It's the bug.

44:19.867 --> 44:21.200
You just apologized, Henry,

44:21.202 --> 44:22.577
and now you're starting
this again?

44:22.579 --> 44:25.454
Kate, open your goddamn eyes!

44:25.456 --> 44:26.664
I'm going for a walk,
I can't...

44:26.666 --> 44:28.499
No, we have got to
get rid of this, okay?

44:28.501 --> 44:29.751
We've gotta get rid
of these bugs!

44:29.753 --> 44:32.045
- What are you talking about?
- Listen, you're full of 'em!

44:32.047 --> 44:33.920
And you're gonna burst and
there's gonna

44:33.922 --> 44:37.215
be hundreds and thousands of
them running everywhere, okay?

44:37.217 --> 44:38.633
Henry, let me go!

44:38.635 --> 44:40.970
When this is done, it'll
just be back to you and I.

44:40.972 --> 44:42.679
Drink this.

44:42.681 --> 44:44.932
Are you fucking insane?

44:44.934 --> 44:46.851
I'm not drinking bleach!

44:46.853 --> 44:50.563
Kate, it will kill them.

44:53.943 --> 44:55.568
We can't take a chance.

44:55.570 --> 44:56.903
I'm gonna cut them outta you,
okay?

44:56.905 --> 44:58.570
I'm gonna cut every last
one of them outta you.

44:58.572 --> 44:59.947
Think about what you're doing.

44:59.949 --> 45:01.782
I'm only thinking about us,
Kate!

45:01.784 --> 45:02.825
Please!

45:02.827 --> 45:03.620
No!

45:19.052 --> 45:21.885
Okay.

45:21.887 --> 45:22.681
Shh, shh.

45:41.657 --> 45:44.534
Henry.

45:44.536 --> 45:48.787
Yeah?

45:48.789 --> 45:51.041
There's a bug in the house.

45:57.257 --> 46:00.260
Do you want me
to kill it?

46:03.637 --> 46:04.431
No.

46:08.976 --> 46:12.187
Put him in a jar
and take him outside.

46:15.900 --> 46:16.693
Yeah.

46:18.360 --> 46:20.154
Yeah, alright, I will.

47:38.148 --> 47:40.816
Serial murderer who preys
on infants and the elderly

47:40.818 --> 47:42.651
has returned to the
streets of London

47:42.653 --> 47:49.157
after vanishing for five
months, police fear.

47:49.159 --> 47:51.577
Eight-month old baby.

47:51.579 --> 47:53.162
Doesn't like it.

47:53.164 --> 47:54.040
Wooden stake.

47:55.541 --> 47:57.543
Suspect is described.

48:00.005 --> 48:03.673
He doesn't like it and so.

48:03.675 --> 48:04.465
What?

48:04.467 --> 48:05.677
Mike doesn't like it.

48:07.012 --> 48:08.388
I'm going out.

48:09.806 --> 48:12.432
Remember to bolt the door,
alright?

48:12.434 --> 48:14.016
Mum.

48:14.018 --> 48:19.021
Mum?

48:19.023 --> 48:21.400
He doesn't like it.

50:49.257 --> 50:50.840
Found this.

50:50.842 --> 50:52.594
Torn apart by human teeth.

50:53.677 --> 50:56.512
You should get some sleep.

50:56.514 --> 50:57.307
No time.

50:58.474 --> 51:00.184
Doing the work of two people.

51:01.311 --> 51:03.269
I hoped you'd stop without me.

51:03.271 --> 51:04.354
We were a team.

51:04.356 --> 51:05.482
We were insane.

51:06.523 --> 51:09.441
They were just people.

51:09.443 --> 51:12.153
They were weak,
they were defenseless.

51:12.155 --> 51:15.408
Bloodthirsty spirits
confined to a feeble body.

51:16.617 --> 51:20.244
A compromise between
God and Satan.

51:20.246 --> 51:22.287
You're in the papers again,
Simon.

51:22.289 --> 51:23.831
They're going to catch you.

51:23.833 --> 51:25.291
Finish this tonight.

51:25.293 --> 51:26.918
What's it gonna be,
another baby?

51:26.920 --> 51:27.711
An old woman?

51:29.880 --> 51:32.925
You're lost, in darkness.

51:36.179 --> 51:37.137
I forgive you.

51:38.722 --> 51:40.432
But that won't save your soul.

51:42.393 --> 51:46.354
Come back, finish the work.

51:46.356 --> 51:48.021
Do you know where it is?

51:48.023 --> 51:50.608
We'll go there now.

51:50.610 --> 51:51.611
You don't need me.

52:32.193 --> 52:34.276
Why are you wearing your mask?

52:34.278 --> 52:36.405
Why aren't you wearing yours?

52:37.657 --> 52:39.659
There's work to be done.

52:40.452 --> 52:41.244
Where?

53:10.856 --> 53:13.106
He's one of
them, he's one of them.

53:13.902 --> 53:16.278
Lock him up, he's one of them!

53:20.867 --> 53:21.659
Thirsty.

53:23.452 --> 53:25.327
It's always thirst.

53:25.329 --> 53:26.704
It never leaves it's room.

53:26.706 --> 53:28.456
It's been like us now,
I promise you.

53:28.458 --> 53:29.706
Liar!

53:29.708 --> 53:33.043
I followed you here from
the heath last night.

53:33.045 --> 53:35.213
Somebody let it in the window!

53:35.215 --> 53:38.298
He doesn't like it after all.

53:38.300 --> 53:40.804
Tapping there all, all alone.

53:41.929 --> 53:42.721
Oh.

53:46.101 --> 53:47.477
No, no!

53:57.487 --> 53:59.072
Now open the door.

54:02.534 --> 54:03.326
Hurry up!

54:34.148 --> 54:35.232
No, no, no!

54:37.902 --> 54:38.820
No, no, no!

54:40.739 --> 54:43.822
No, no, no!

55:33.458 --> 55:36.041
How have they been
treating you?

55:36.043 --> 55:38.753
About what you'd expect.

55:38.755 --> 55:40.882
They're just trying to
fatten you up a little.

55:44.635 --> 55:47.179
It's gonna be okay, I promise.

55:50.557 --> 55:52.601
Now you have to tell
me the truth.

55:54.646 --> 55:55.855
Did you do it?

56:03.487 --> 56:05.489
Mrs. Van der
Sloot, you may begin.

56:09.369 --> 56:10.412
Yes, Mr. Stonewright.

56:11.454 --> 56:13.037
You were at the scene
of the supposed crime

56:13.039 --> 56:15.373
my client is accused of,
correct?

56:15.375 --> 56:16.166
That's correct.

56:17.335 --> 56:18.751
What were you doing that day?

56:18.753 --> 56:20.461
I was walking my dog.

56:20.463 --> 56:22.421
On the corner of 48th and
Main, correct?

56:22.423 --> 56:23.880
Yes, that's correct.

56:23.882 --> 56:25.090
And what did you see?

56:25.092 --> 56:27.677
I saw that man walking
about 50 feet ahead of me.

56:27.679 --> 56:29.762
And the child?

56:29.764 --> 56:31.472
She was only a few feet in
front of him.

56:31.474 --> 56:33.557
And then what happened?

56:33.559 --> 56:35.976
Well, the little girl
wasn't paying attention.

56:35.978 --> 56:39.688
Occasionally she would hop off
the sidewalk into the street.

56:39.690 --> 56:41.733
And that's when the
incident occurred.

56:41.735 --> 56:42.941
That's correct.

56:42.943 --> 56:44.820
I saw that man push her.

56:46.030 --> 56:47.070
Push her?

56:47.072 --> 56:49.197
Yes,
push her.

56:49.199 --> 56:51.700
Did the thrust appear
to be malicious in nature?

56:51.702 --> 56:52.492
He definitely was pushing her

56:52.494 --> 56:54.619
with a large amount of force.

56:54.621 --> 56:55.996
Into oncoming traffic?

56:55.998 --> 56:57.248
That's correct.

56:57.250 --> 56:59.251
Let me ask the question one
more time.

57:00.336 --> 57:04.255
Do you feel that my client
had malicious intent

57:04.257 --> 57:08.885
when he shoved the
child that day?

57:08.887 --> 57:13.472
Absolutely, he had
hate in his eyes.

57:13.474 --> 57:16.809
No further questions,
Your Honor.

57:16.811 --> 57:18.771
Mr. Wrenson,
you may proceed.

57:22.733 --> 57:23.442
Mr. Stonewright, would you
consider yourself a moral man?

57:30.909 --> 57:33.700
Remember, you are under oath.

57:33.702 --> 57:34.994
No.

57:34.996 --> 57:35.787
No?

57:35.789 --> 57:37.704
I don't consider myself moral.

57:37.706 --> 57:40.708
I cheat on my taxes,
watch my neighbor undress

57:40.710 --> 57:43.753
through the window,
occasionally shoplift.

57:43.755 --> 57:46.463
I even ate my dog
later that day.

57:46.465 --> 57:49.050
You know, immoral
stuff like that.

57:49.052 --> 57:50.300
Typical, right?

57:50.302 --> 57:53.679
Now, all that may be true.

57:53.681 --> 57:58.559
You may do all those very
immoral things,

57:58.561 --> 58:01.061
however, is it true
that you secretly

58:01.063 --> 58:03.690
donate food to shelters
every month?

58:03.692 --> 58:05.566
Objection, relevance?

58:05.568 --> 58:07.568
Overruled.

58:07.570 --> 58:12.365
Is it true?

58:12.367 --> 58:16.202
Mr. Stonewright, we
have plenty of evidence

58:16.204 --> 58:21.209
to support this so please
answer the question truthfully.

58:25.295 --> 58:27.213
Yes, yes, I do.

58:27.215 --> 58:29.340
You do
what, Mr. Stonewright?

58:29.342 --> 58:31.925
Speak loudly so the
jury can hear you.

58:31.927 --> 58:35.722
I donate food to shelters,
on occasion.

58:35.724 --> 58:41.644
Now, would
you consider this a moral act?

58:41.646 --> 58:42.854
Yes, but...

58:42.856 --> 58:44.981
But what, Mr.
Stonewright?

58:44.983 --> 58:47.608
The food was poisoned,
I swear to you.

58:47.610 --> 58:49.776
It should have made everyone
in the shelter deathly ill.

58:49.778 --> 58:51.737
But it didn't, Mr.
Stonewright.

58:51.739 --> 58:55.615
Now, since you are a
self-confessed moral,

58:55.617 --> 58:57.827
do you honestly think
the jury should

58:57.829 --> 59:00.164
believe what you saw that day?

59:01.206 --> 59:06.501
Answer the question.

59:06.503 --> 59:07.795
No.

59:07.797 --> 59:10.673
Did you see Mr. Booth shove
the girl

59:10.675 --> 59:12.844
in front of oncoming traffic?

59:15.472 --> 59:17.891
Or was Mr. Booth
being moral also?

59:19.224 --> 59:20.724
I can't be sure.

59:20.726 --> 59:23.019
Can't be sure.

59:23.021 --> 59:25.190
Could he have been pushing
her out of harm's way?

59:26.608 --> 59:27.648
You said the child was stepping

59:27.650 --> 59:29.775
in and out of the
street carelessly.

59:29.777 --> 59:30.985
Yes.

59:30.987 --> 59:33.612
Would you say it's
possible that Mr. Booth

59:33.614 --> 59:36.657
saved the child's life instead
of attempting to end it?

59:36.659 --> 59:39.786
No, uh, I mean.

59:39.788 --> 59:40.914
- Yes or no.
- Maybe.

59:50.590 --> 59:51.383
Yes.

59:53.760 --> 59:55.592
No further questions,
Your Honor.

59:57.889 --> 59:59.554
Now, Mrs. Paddington, you were

59:59.556 --> 01:00:02.141
driving the car that fateful
day, correct?

01:00:02.143 --> 01:00:03.392
That's right.

01:00:03.394 --> 01:00:05.853
I was heading down 48th,
about to cross Denver

01:00:05.855 --> 01:00:10.816
when I saw Mr. Booth shove
Allison Grove into traffic.

01:00:10.818 --> 01:00:11.733
And what did you do then?

01:00:11.735 --> 01:00:13.235
I accelerated.

01:00:13.237 --> 01:00:14.403
You accelerated?

01:00:14.405 --> 01:00:15.278
Yes.

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:18.490
I hit the accelerator as hard as
I could.

01:00:18.492 --> 01:00:20.575
I wanted to smear that kid.

01:00:20.577 --> 01:00:22.831
Okay, but you just missed her.

01:00:24.039 --> 01:00:25.208
Yes.

01:00:26.001 --> 01:00:27.208
Sadly.

01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:29.711
I agree, would have
been nice and messy.

01:00:29.713 --> 01:00:33.338
Objection,
she's leading the witness.

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:34.592
I'll allow it.

01:00:35.385 --> 01:00:37.885
Now, since you were
behind the wheel,

01:00:37.887 --> 01:00:40.554
how clearly could you
see the defendant?

01:00:40.556 --> 01:00:42.305
Very clearly.

01:00:42.307 --> 01:00:44.766
He was most
definitely attempting

01:00:44.768 --> 01:00:48.311
to push Allison with
the intention of harm.

01:00:48.313 --> 01:00:49.648
No further questions.

01:00:51.775 --> 01:00:52.902
Mr. Wrenson.

01:00:57.574 --> 01:01:00.657
Mrs. Paddington,
why didn't you

01:01:00.659 --> 01:01:03.996
hit Allison Grove with your car?

01:01:05.206 --> 01:01:07.791
You seemed very
excited to do so.

01:01:08.918 --> 01:01:09.919
I just missed her.

01:01:11.170 --> 01:01:13.670
It was very disappointing.

01:01:13.672 --> 01:01:16.175
And you said you accelerated.

01:01:17.552 --> 01:01:18.970
That's right.

01:01:20.929 --> 01:01:24.432
And yet there were
obvious tire tracks

01:01:24.434 --> 01:01:28.063
matching your tires'
tread on your vehicle.

01:01:29.521 --> 01:01:32.273
Seems to me you were
breaking and swerving.

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:35.901
The evidence doesn't lie.

01:01:35.903 --> 01:01:38.528
Objection, my witness
is not on trial.

01:01:38.530 --> 01:01:39.905
Overruled.

01:01:39.907 --> 01:01:42.657
We were able to obtain Mrs.
Paddington's phone records

01:01:42.659 --> 01:01:46.829
for the exact moment
of the crime.

01:01:46.831 --> 01:01:49.206
If it pleases the court,
I would like

01:01:49.208 --> 01:01:52.126
to submit this evidence
into testimony.

01:01:52.128 --> 01:01:57.298
Now, Mrs. Paddington,
according to your phone records

01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:02.305
you were texting at the
exact moment of the crime.

01:02:03.431 --> 01:02:05.684
I will remind you,
you're still under oath.

01:02:08.644 --> 01:02:09.726
Yes.

01:02:09.728 --> 01:02:10.853
And were
you texting,

01:02:10.855 --> 01:02:15.860
or should I say sexting, a man
by the name of Norman Davis?

01:02:17.362 --> 01:02:18.863
That's correct.

01:02:20.864 --> 01:02:25.867
He's my fuckbuddy.

01:02:25.869 --> 01:02:29.789
Now, if true, and you
were texting

01:02:29.791 --> 01:02:33.543
at that exact moment,
how could you

01:02:33.545 --> 01:02:36.965
possibly have seen the
defendant push Allison Grove?

01:02:38.132 --> 01:02:39.673
I...

01:02:39.675 --> 01:02:41.800
Am I to assume
that while you were texting

01:02:41.802 --> 01:02:47.807
your lover you weren't
paying attention to the road?

01:02:47.809 --> 01:02:49.266
Yes.

01:02:49.268 --> 01:02:51.394
And are we
to assume that when you did

01:02:51.396 --> 01:02:55.567
see the girl you swerved
to miss her?

01:03:00.612 --> 01:03:01.489
Yes.

01:03:02.824 --> 01:03:05.577
No further
questions, Your Honor.

01:03:09.621 --> 01:03:11.665
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

01:03:12.876 --> 01:03:14.753
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

01:03:18.047 --> 01:03:18.795
On the count
of failure

01:03:18.797 --> 01:03:20.882
to commit first degree murder,

01:03:20.884 --> 01:03:24.721
we the jury find the defendant,
Nathan Booth, guilty.

01:03:27.056 --> 01:03:28.805
In keeping with the
verdict, I sentence you,

01:03:28.807 --> 01:03:31.976
Nathan Michael Booth,
to death by consumption.

01:03:31.978 --> 01:03:33.269
Sentence to be
carried out immediately

01:03:33.271 --> 01:03:35.188
following this session.

01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:38.066
Court is adjourned.

01:03:48.119 --> 01:03:51.914
Nathan, be honest
with me, did you do it?

01:03:53.541 --> 01:03:54.417
Yeah, I did.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.043
She was walking in
front of a car

01:03:57.045 --> 01:03:58.713
and I pushed her out of the way.

01:04:01.298 --> 01:04:04.175
When did you know?

01:04:04.177 --> 01:04:05.178
Know what?

01:04:06.887 --> 01:04:08.181
That you were one of them.

01:04:10.766 --> 01:04:12.059
I've always known.

01:04:22.653 --> 01:04:23.443
You know, there's more of us out

01:04:23.445 --> 01:04:34.079
there than you think there are.

01:04:34.081 --> 01:04:35.123
He confessed.

01:04:35.125 --> 01:04:36.249
Remember our agreement.

01:04:36.251 --> 01:04:38.628
He's to be given a
quick death and no pain.

01:04:47.177 --> 01:04:48.429
I hope they choke on me.

01:05:04.195 --> 01:05:06.028
Our streets!

01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:08.113
Our streets!

01:05:08.115 --> 01:05:10.074
Our streets!

01:05:10.076 --> 01:05:11.700
Our streets!

01:05:11.702 --> 01:05:12.704
Our streets!

01:05:13.538 --> 01:05:14.539
Our streets!

01:05:15.456 --> 01:05:16.458
Our streets!

01:05:19.043 --> 01:05:21.045
Congrats, Calvin,
another win

01:05:22.255 --> 01:05:24.798
You forgot your to-go bag,
dear.

01:05:27.052 --> 01:05:29.135
He didn't have much
meat on his bones.

01:05:29.137 --> 01:05:30.430
He had a lotta guts though.

01:05:31.806 --> 01:05:34.891
Why do you do it, defend them?

01:05:34.893 --> 01:05:35.726
Someone has to.

01:05:36.769 --> 01:05:41.021
I must say, I prefer
you this way.

01:05:41.023 --> 01:05:44.066
I gotta make my clients
feel comfortable somehow.

01:05:44.068 --> 01:05:46.068
The world needs me, you know.

01:05:46.070 --> 01:05:48.905
Gotta have some semblance
of order in the chaos.

01:05:48.907 --> 01:05:53.200
What will you do when there
are no more of them left?

01:05:55.121 --> 01:05:56.456
I'm sure I'll find a hobby.

01:05:57.289 --> 01:05:59.956
Though I think it will get
pretty boring.

01:06:54.389 --> 01:06:58.099
This is a simple procedure
with low risk of complication.

01:06:58.101 --> 01:06:59.266
You'll be under for about three

01:06:59.268 --> 01:07:02.186
hours and you
won't feel a thing.

01:07:02.188 --> 01:07:04.856
When you wake up, we'll
talk about it then.

01:07:04.858 --> 01:07:06.315
Do you have any questions?

01:07:06.317 --> 01:07:07.858
No, I'm okay, thank you.

01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:08.652
Good.

01:07:11.447 --> 01:07:13.197
I'm just gonna lower you down

01:07:13.199 --> 01:07:18.536
a little bit so
you're lying flat.

01:07:18.538 --> 01:07:20.329
This is the oxygen.

01:07:20.331 --> 01:07:23.333
So I'm gonna need you
to count down from 10.

01:07:23.335 --> 01:07:24.126
Breathe.

01:07:26.170 --> 01:07:28.588
10.

01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:29.796
Nine.

01:07:29.798 --> 01:07:31.423
Yeah, just breathe.

01:07:31.425 --> 01:07:32.217
Eight.

01:07:34.346 --> 01:07:35.635
Seven.

01:07:35.637 --> 01:07:36.637
Keep breathing.

01:07:36.639 --> 01:07:37.432
Six.

01:07:38.807 --> 01:07:40.307
That's good.

01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:41.309
Five.

01:07:41.311 --> 01:07:42.559
Just relax.

01:07:42.561 --> 01:07:44.394
Four.

01:07:44.396 --> 01:07:45.938
Relax.

01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:47.317
Three.

01:07:48.443 --> 01:07:49.235
Two.
