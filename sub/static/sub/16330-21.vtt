WEBVTT

00:03.227 --> 00:04.861
You erased my memory.

00:05.617 --> 00:06.863
You.

00:06.865 --> 00:08.197
Not Shepherd.

00:08.199 --> 00:10.998
You. I remember.

00:11.023 --> 00:12.969
Roman, please listen to me.

00:12.971 --> 00:14.437
You did this to me!

00:14.439 --> 00:15.856
Roman, listen to me.

00:16.674 --> 00:17.793
Stop!

00:20.445 --> 00:22.044
Stop. Roman...

00:24.000 --> 00:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:45.870 --> 00:48.196
I need my sister back.

00:49.374 --> 00:51.474
We had a whole life together
that you chose to erase.

00:51.476 --> 00:54.110
I'm gonna find your rabbit
and I'm gonna make him bleed.

00:54.112 --> 00:55.811
We know you've been lying to us.

00:57.048 --> 00:58.633
Aah!

01:11.227 --> 01:12.893
Get out.

01:13.932 --> 01:16.407
I never meant to hurt you,

01:16.432 --> 01:18.367
and I never wanted to lie.

01:18.369 --> 01:21.537
- I was trying to help.
- You're still lying.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.623
Everything you did,
you did for yourself.

01:23.648 --> 01:25.323
That's not true.

01:27.779 --> 01:29.378
I saved your life.

01:29.380 --> 01:32.143
Shepherd wanted to kill
you and I stopped her.

01:33.232 --> 01:36.168
And this is the thanks I get.

01:36.193 --> 01:38.357
My memory erased, my...

01:39.457 --> 01:42.058
my whole life stolen.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.026
Wiping your memory was the only way

01:44.028 --> 01:46.150
I could bring you into the FBI.

01:46.175 --> 01:49.228
It was that or one of
us killing the other.

01:49.253 --> 01:51.500
It was my only choice.

01:51.798 --> 01:54.776
It wasn't your choice to make.

01:59.991 --> 02:02.300
My memories are coming back.

02:04.817 --> 02:07.616
And the more I remember,

02:07.618 --> 02:09.752
the more I hate you.

02:18.420 --> 02:21.833
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

02:21.858 --> 02:25.634
Roman snapped because we
lied, and that was your call.

02:25.636 --> 02:27.703
You and Nas.

02:27.705 --> 02:29.342
Roman can still help us.

02:29.367 --> 02:31.639
He said his memories are coming back.

02:32.452 --> 02:35.011
His body wasn't flooded
with ZIP like yours was.

02:35.013 --> 02:36.746
It was one dose.

02:36.748 --> 02:38.202
It's wearing off.

02:38.227 --> 02:41.617
So that means that your brother
is reverting to his old ways.

02:50.597 --> 02:52.709
Pellington is here.

02:54.334 --> 02:55.865
You busy?

02:55.867 --> 02:59.195
Just prepping my drives
for a data migration.

02:59.220 --> 03:00.552
What do you need?

03:01.737 --> 03:03.270
Leverage.

03:03.295 --> 03:05.151
Parker's the closest
we've been to Shepherd,

03:05.176 --> 03:07.276
and the only thing he
said in the last 19 hours

03:07.278 --> 03:09.412
is that we're running out of time.

03:15.352 --> 03:16.786
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:16.788 --> 03:18.022
Are you back?

03:18.047 --> 03:20.663
No, just a session with Dr. Sun.

03:20.765 --> 03:22.304
How's that going?

03:22.329 --> 03:24.693
Yeah. Um...

03:24.695 --> 03:28.280
I should probably let you guys
know, I put in for a transfer.

03:29.463 --> 03:31.616
What? Where?

03:31.641 --> 03:32.900
Quantico.

03:33.741 --> 03:35.771
Criminal profiler instructor
position opened up,

03:35.773 --> 03:37.540
so I'm gonna take it.

03:37.542 --> 03:39.075
It's actually perfect for me right now.

03:39.077 --> 03:40.342
I've been thinking
about it for a long time.

03:40.344 --> 03:41.398
How long?

03:41.423 --> 03:43.379
Oh, since I got out of the academy.

03:43.381 --> 03:45.460
No, how long are you
gonna be in Quantico?

03:46.317 --> 03:49.554
Uh, for good.

03:51.295 --> 03:53.262
It's over.

03:53.626 --> 03:57.452
I'm officially declassifying
the Jane Doe project.

03:57.477 --> 04:00.898
The tattoos, Sandstorm, everything.

04:00.923 --> 04:03.232
It's time to put a
public face on the enemy.

04:03.234 --> 04:04.967
Whose face?

04:05.812 --> 04:09.238
Shepherd and Roman for now.

04:09.905 --> 04:12.641
In light of Ms. Doe's
service to the FBI,

04:12.643 --> 04:14.880
I'm still undecided
what to do about her.

04:14.905 --> 04:17.446
If you brand Roman a
terrorist and a traitor,

04:17.447 --> 04:19.447
there's... there's no going back.

04:19.450 --> 04:21.450
Your brother stopped being useful

04:21.452 --> 04:22.724
the second he tried to kill you.

04:22.749 --> 04:24.854
No, he was angry, he
wasn't trying to kill me.

04:24.856 --> 04:27.629
His security detail paints
a much different picture.

04:27.654 --> 04:30.049
Roman is more useful now than ever.

04:30.074 --> 04:32.795
- Jane.
- His memories are coming back.

04:33.652 --> 04:34.963
You knew about this?

04:34.988 --> 04:37.018
It is possible that his
drugs are wearing off.

04:37.043 --> 04:38.598
Oh.

04:38.623 --> 04:39.969
That changes things.

04:39.971 --> 04:42.065
We'll go public with Shepherd.

04:42.090 --> 04:45.074
Roman will go to the CIA
to accelerate his recall.

04:45.076 --> 04:47.109
- You can't.
- I can and I will.

04:47.111 --> 04:50.140
He'll be in a black
site by the end of day.

04:50.715 --> 04:52.915
Please. There's got to
be something we can do.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.818
I don't think there is, Jane.

04:54.843 --> 04:56.819
We just found a new angle on Parker.

05:01.787 --> 05:03.192
Devon's pregnant.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.830
Our medical report matches the one done

05:07.832 --> 05:09.532
while Devon was in jail.

05:09.534 --> 05:11.903
- How many weeks?
- Five.

05:11.928 --> 05:13.201
And judging by the look on your face,

05:13.226 --> 05:15.092
I'm guessing you had no idea.

05:16.092 --> 05:18.574
If I were you, I'd be
doing everything I can

05:18.576 --> 05:20.709
to make sure that my kid
wasn't born in a supermax.

05:20.734 --> 05:23.325
No, you could have
doctored these reports.

05:23.350 --> 05:27.372
This is your one chance to
do the right thing for her.

05:27.397 --> 05:29.241
For your child.

05:32.898 --> 05:35.209
There's a server warehouse up 87.

05:36.107 --> 05:38.779
Shepherd's plans,
identities, financial intel,

05:38.804 --> 05:41.564
stolen government
documents, it's all there.

05:41.566 --> 05:44.238
You're gonna need to be a little
more specific with that location.

05:44.263 --> 05:47.066
Not until Devon's as far away
from Shepherd as possible.

05:47.091 --> 05:48.904
It's gonna looked like she
flipped to save herself.

05:48.906 --> 05:50.406
I need to know that she's out of reach.

05:50.408 --> 05:51.873
What do you propose?

05:51.898 --> 05:53.419
Put her on a plane.

05:54.503 --> 05:56.696
Devon has family in London.

05:56.721 --> 05:59.355
When she touches down,
the location's yours.

05:59.380 --> 06:00.927
We'll put her in the air.

06:00.952 --> 06:04.053
And if your location checks
out, then she lands at Heathrow.

06:04.055 --> 06:07.122
If you're lying to us,
she lands at Guantanamo.

06:07.124 --> 06:08.924
It'll check out.

06:10.083 --> 06:12.515
- I mean, I'm just gonna say it....
- It could be a trap.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.763
Or it could be the break
we've been waiting for.

06:14.765 --> 06:16.703
- We can't ignore this.
- Agreed.

06:16.728 --> 06:18.067
We'll roll out in a convoy.

06:18.069 --> 06:19.837
Tasha, keep working on Parker.

06:19.862 --> 06:22.939
Now that he started talking,
keep pushing him for intel.

06:34.449 --> 06:35.621
Go.

06:48.381 --> 06:50.695
Three, two, one. Go.

06:57.126 --> 06:59.297
It's a complete replica of our office.

06:59.322 --> 07:01.143
It's a training ground.

07:01.145 --> 07:02.811
They've been using this to practice.

07:02.813 --> 07:05.712
'Cause they're about to take down
the New York office of the FBI.

07:11.088 --> 07:16.088
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font>
www.addic7ed.com

07:17.174 --> 07:18.741
It's exactly the same.

07:18.743 --> 07:21.305
How did Sandstorm build this?

07:21.330 --> 07:23.447
Borden always had his phone on him.

07:23.994 --> 07:25.782
He must have taken photos of everything.

07:25.784 --> 07:28.000
We have to warn everyone at SIOC.

07:28.025 --> 07:29.838
They're jamming our signal.

07:29.863 --> 07:32.230
They could be trying to
infiltrate us right now.

07:34.259 --> 07:35.825
Homeland Security IT.

07:35.827 --> 07:37.181
We got a mandatory hardware upgrade,

07:37.206 --> 07:38.528
needs to be done on site.

07:38.530 --> 07:40.375
ID, work order?

07:40.400 --> 07:42.298
All right, fall back to the SUVs.

07:44.002 --> 07:45.142
Sniper!

07:53.584 --> 07:54.910
Clear.

08:11.416 --> 08:12.944
Let's get back to the team.

08:13.469 --> 08:15.093
An attack is imminent.

08:22.250 --> 08:25.308
Hold on a second. I thought
you said it was a hardware...

08:27.512 --> 08:30.055
I need a clean bill
of mental health, so...

08:34.775 --> 08:37.094
You're the one who suggested I quit.

08:37.119 --> 08:38.855
I don't remember saying that.

08:38.857 --> 08:40.438
What do you want me to say?

08:40.970 --> 08:42.736
Something true.

08:47.332 --> 08:48.614
Okay.

08:50.969 --> 08:52.854
I don't feel my sharpest right now.

08:52.879 --> 08:57.011
I don't think being in the
field is the best for me.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.908
So you think needing help

08:58.910 --> 09:01.245
precludes you from helping others?

09:01.270 --> 09:03.813
Field agents need to be strong.

09:03.815 --> 09:08.417
If anyone out there
sees me as weak or...

09:12.416 --> 09:14.442
I just need you to sign.

09:29.466 --> 09:31.199
That's it?

09:31.224 --> 09:32.524
I can go?

09:32.549 --> 09:33.909
Of course.

09:35.346 --> 09:38.214
But you're still going to be
Edgar Reade when you get there.

09:42.409 --> 09:44.345
- It's not working.
- Keep trying, Jane.

09:44.370 --> 09:45.581
I'm calling NYPD.

09:45.606 --> 09:47.282
We gotta get back before it's too late.

09:47.307 --> 09:49.025
Sandstorm is scrambling all the NYO's

09:49.027 --> 09:50.393
incoming communication right now.

09:50.418 --> 09:52.384
The threat is already in the building.

09:52.409 --> 09:53.873
Come on.

09:53.898 --> 09:55.493
I need you to stop what you're doing

09:55.518 --> 09:58.568
and give me everything we've
got on Shepherd and Sandstorm.

09:58.570 --> 10:00.681
Does Weller know about this?

10:00.706 --> 10:03.116
Yes, he's aware, not that it matters.

10:03.141 --> 10:05.798
I'm issuing you a direct order.

10:05.823 --> 10:06.971
Right.

10:06.996 --> 10:09.645
Okay, I can totally transfer everything

10:09.670 --> 10:11.447
- to a secure hard drive.
- Great.

10:11.449 --> 10:13.840
But it would be way
faster and more stable

10:13.865 --> 10:16.355
if you can just wait until after
this database migration is done.

10:16.380 --> 10:17.853
I'm just prepping the drives.

10:17.855 --> 10:19.230
I was gonna do it tonight,

10:19.255 --> 10:20.762
because all of my systems

10:20.778 --> 10:23.096
have to go into boot
mode for 30 minutes, so...

10:23.121 --> 10:25.681
That's our Wireless Emergency Alert.

10:26.239 --> 10:28.723
_

10:33.566 --> 10:35.120
Oh, God!

10:35.145 --> 10:37.596
Active shooters in SIOC.

10:37.621 --> 10:39.245
Evacuate the building.

10:39.270 --> 10:41.030
I'll rendezvous with
the armed response team

10:41.032 --> 10:43.080
and neutralize the shooters.

10:43.105 --> 10:45.846
Go. Go, go, go, go, go.
Get to safety, come on.

10:45.871 --> 10:48.315
This is an emergency evacuation.

10:48.340 --> 10:50.652
Proceed to the nearest exit.

10:54.032 --> 10:55.867
How the hell did they get in here?

10:55.914 --> 10:57.634
I don't know yet.

10:57.940 --> 10:59.296
Wait.

10:59.604 --> 11:02.172
- Wait, wait, did you just see that?
- See what?

11:09.848 --> 11:11.588
The screen just flickered.

11:11.613 --> 11:13.291
The shooter disappeared
for a split second

11:13.316 --> 11:14.849
and then he came back.

11:22.027 --> 11:23.693
Where are they?

11:23.695 --> 11:26.429
- That's not the real feed.
- Why?

11:26.454 --> 11:28.776
Someone wanted us to evacuate.

11:30.113 --> 11:31.334
Where are they?

11:33.824 --> 11:35.885
Drop your weapons! Now!

11:35.910 --> 11:38.246
- We have control of this building.
- Lay down your weapons!

11:38.271 --> 11:39.676
You are outnumbered and surrounded.

11:39.678 --> 11:40.759
Stand fast!

11:40.784 --> 11:43.138
- Order your team to stand down!
- I will not give that order!

11:43.163 --> 11:45.148
You're under arrest, Major General.

11:45.150 --> 11:47.317
- Oh, my God.
- I will not repeat myself.

11:47.319 --> 11:48.919
This is your last chance, Director!

11:48.944 --> 11:50.169
Lay down your weapons!

11:50.194 --> 11:52.216
I have the tactical advantage!

11:52.632 --> 11:53.898
Stand down!

12:17.148 --> 12:18.711
- No, no, no, no, no!
- We have to go, we have to...

12:18.736 --> 12:20.391
You can't help them out there!

12:20.416 --> 12:22.452
I am locking this building down.

12:22.454 --> 12:24.768
Shepherd used our security
protocols against us.

12:24.793 --> 12:27.090
The evacuation forced
open the exterior doors

12:27.092 --> 12:28.958
and left us vulnerable
to incoming threats.

12:28.983 --> 12:31.213
All I can do now...

12:31.238 --> 12:32.720
... is seal them in.

12:42.607 --> 12:43.882
Uhh!

12:43.907 --> 12:46.086
That didn't need to happen, Sam.

12:46.111 --> 12:48.778
I just need to borrow
Agent Patterson's lab.

12:48.780 --> 12:50.148
Just give me your admin code

12:50.173 --> 12:52.515
so I can lift the lockdown
and access her system.

12:52.517 --> 12:54.150
Could you hand me my gun?

12:54.152 --> 12:55.952
You're under arrest.

13:03.260 --> 13:05.972
I'm surprised you can
find humor in this.

13:05.997 --> 13:09.232
I doubt these agents' families
will feel the same way.

13:10.656 --> 13:12.356
You're not getting that code.

13:12.381 --> 13:14.947
You're never getting
into Patterson's system.

13:16.441 --> 13:18.377
Because you're never
getting out of this room.

13:18.402 --> 13:20.543
You're trapped and you know it.

13:20.545 --> 13:21.744
Line 'em up!

13:30.188 --> 13:32.143
Give me the code...

13:32.423 --> 13:35.065
or I'll execute them one by one.

13:43.149 --> 13:44.916
Give me the code.

13:48.437 --> 13:50.607
Your plan is flawed.

13:51.176 --> 13:55.500
It relies on us being
stupid and cowardly.

13:56.109 --> 13:58.375
And we are not those things.

13:59.233 --> 14:01.140
We are the FBI.

14:05.457 --> 14:07.766
Give me the code.

14:10.829 --> 14:15.563
The FBI doesn't
negotiate with terrorists.

14:19.866 --> 14:20.958
All right.

14:20.983 --> 14:22.069
All right.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.444
Let's try something else.

14:25.757 --> 14:28.111
Whoever gives me the code

14:28.113 --> 14:30.648
will save the director's life...

14:30.673 --> 14:32.531
and their own.

14:37.089 --> 14:38.922
It's okay.

14:39.837 --> 14:42.196
This is how we win.

14:44.187 --> 14:46.266
By staying strong.

14:51.803 --> 14:53.272
Very well.

14:53.671 --> 14:55.338
No!

14:57.460 --> 14:59.333
I know Weller's code.

14:59.358 --> 15:01.835
I deliver a new one
to him every morning.

15:04.046 --> 15:06.582
- What's your name?
- Briana.

15:06.584 --> 15:07.749
Briana...

15:07.774 --> 15:10.174
Just please don't hurt anybody else.

15:11.546 --> 15:13.986
What's the code, Briana?

15:14.011 --> 15:18.347
7-M-T-J-P-9.

15:19.991 --> 15:21.798
_

15:23.235 --> 15:24.631
You need to stop this.

15:24.656 --> 15:26.475
Weller's code overrides mine.

15:29.593 --> 15:31.890
You did the right thing, Briana.

15:31.915 --> 15:33.737
You can sit down now.

15:42.188 --> 15:44.021
You're a brave man.

15:51.756 --> 15:53.889
Anyone else feeling brave?

15:57.678 --> 15:58.912
Guard the hostages.

15:58.914 --> 16:00.647
Round up any other agents.

16:00.649 --> 16:02.098
Secure the armory.

16:02.123 --> 16:03.416
Alpha Point.

16:03.418 --> 16:06.037
Find Parker and Devon.
I want a word with them.

16:06.062 --> 16:09.388
Bravo Point, with me to the lab.

16:11.348 --> 16:12.926
They're heading right for us.

16:12.928 --> 16:14.309
We need guns.

16:14.334 --> 16:15.900
We get to the armory before Shepherd,

16:15.925 --> 16:17.739
we stand a fighting chance.

16:18.900 --> 16:21.001
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

16:21.003 --> 16:22.869
I'm starting the database migration.

16:22.871 --> 16:24.495
Patterson, we gotta go.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.097
Okay, okay, okay, okay...

16:26.122 --> 16:27.925
Okay, we're in boot mode.

16:27.950 --> 16:31.051
Whatever Shepherd was
after, this'll slow her down.

16:31.441 --> 16:34.039
_

16:35.784 --> 16:37.171
Yes, sir.

16:38.359 --> 16:39.786
That was the governor.

16:39.788 --> 16:41.828
Sandstorm has cut the NYO off.

16:41.853 --> 16:44.024
That replica would have
taken months to make.

16:44.026 --> 16:46.660
They've been planning
this for a long time.

16:47.031 --> 16:49.320
- You think this is phase two?
- Possibly.

16:49.345 --> 16:51.698
Whatever it is, we gotta get
back and we gotta stop it.

16:51.700 --> 16:53.639
Sandstorm, they might be
controlling the building,

16:53.664 --> 16:55.101
but they don't know it as well as I do.

16:55.103 --> 16:57.070
There's a sub-basement
beneath the bottom floor.

16:57.072 --> 16:58.338
In a maintenance elevator.

16:58.340 --> 17:01.541
Back in the '80s, the city started
construction to extend the N line.

17:01.543 --> 17:04.075
It went underneath what's now the NYO.

17:04.099 --> 17:05.632
They had to cancel the project.

17:05.656 --> 17:07.290
But that access tunnel still exists.

17:07.315 --> 17:09.181
- So that's our way in.
- Yes.

17:11.285 --> 17:13.032
Radio the hostage team.

17:13.058 --> 17:15.502
I want a death toll and a head count.

17:16.691 --> 17:18.258
Since when is the attack today?

17:18.260 --> 17:19.894
Since you got caught.

17:19.919 --> 17:22.294
I can't have prisoners knowing the plan.

17:22.297 --> 17:23.563
Where's Devon?

17:23.565 --> 17:25.089
Weller and Remi took
her to a black site.

17:25.114 --> 17:26.855
They were supposed to be here.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.300
Well, at least now we know
there won't be a problem.

17:29.325 --> 17:31.492
Patterson's the problem.

17:31.517 --> 17:33.331
She's put the whole system in boot mode.

17:33.356 --> 17:34.769
So we kill the boot mode.

17:34.794 --> 17:37.561
Interrupting the migration
could corrupt the drives.

17:37.586 --> 17:39.019
No.

17:39.172 --> 17:41.858
We've come too far to
lose access entirely.

17:41.883 --> 17:43.706
So we wait till it's
finished and then we...

17:43.731 --> 17:45.531
We have targets in four time zones.

17:45.576 --> 17:47.864
I don't have time to wait.

17:47.889 --> 17:49.547
Find Patterson!

17:49.572 --> 17:51.572
I don't want any more delays.

17:55.489 --> 17:57.623
You're gonna want to see this.

18:04.285 --> 18:05.972
Roman.

18:10.770 --> 18:12.042
Whoa!

18:12.067 --> 18:13.487
It looks like we got the same idea.

18:13.519 --> 18:15.823
There's a Sandstorm team heading
this way. We gotta keep moving.

18:15.848 --> 18:17.539
Why are they here? Do we
know what Shepherd wants?

18:17.564 --> 18:20.018
Well, my lab, for starters.
Clearly, there's something in there

18:20.043 --> 18:22.066
that she can't get
from any other terminal.

18:22.695 --> 18:25.493
Wait. The Homeland Security Intranet.

18:25.518 --> 18:27.498
What? No, that's a closed
circuit, highly encrypted system.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.018
Not from my lab.

18:29.043 --> 18:30.968
It's the one FBI
computer that communicates

18:30.970 --> 18:33.454
with the entire DHS
digital infrastructure.

18:33.479 --> 18:35.306
Nothing good's gonna happen if
she starts messing with that.

18:35.308 --> 18:37.462
How long until the
database migration finishes?

18:37.487 --> 18:39.126
Not long.

18:39.151 --> 18:42.642
But, if we can get to the server room,

18:42.682 --> 18:45.550
maybe I can redirect some
of the auxiliary power

18:45.575 --> 18:47.041
and overload my computers.

18:47.066 --> 18:48.556
Maybe? How maybe?

18:48.581 --> 18:49.823
80%.

18:50.101 --> 18:53.523
75% if I'm being honest.

18:53.548 --> 18:55.815
Okay, closer to 60, really.

18:57.825 --> 18:59.157
Take what we can get.

18:59.159 --> 19:01.230
All right, we're getting there.

19:02.074 --> 19:04.161
- The team, do you think they're...
- Let's not think.

19:04.186 --> 19:06.354
Let's get in there first.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.041
Roman, he's...

19:08.066 --> 19:11.627
he's a sitting duck in that
cell if Shepherd finds him.

19:11.652 --> 19:14.338
- If I hadn't lied to him...
- You had to lie.

19:14.887 --> 19:16.683
'Cause you knew.

19:18.332 --> 19:19.510
Okay.

19:19.512 --> 19:22.166
Deep down, you knew what he was

19:22.191 --> 19:25.131
and you were scared of what he'd do

19:25.171 --> 19:27.058
when he learned the truth.

19:30.912 --> 19:32.523
If Roman's returning to who he was,

19:32.525 --> 19:34.332
then what does that mean for me?

19:34.357 --> 19:35.760
You're not your brother.

19:35.762 --> 19:38.353
- We have to save him.
- We're doing everything we can.

19:56.590 --> 19:59.175
All the alarms, the chaos.

19:59.419 --> 20:01.219
Should have guessed it was you.

20:02.455 --> 20:03.956
You remember me?

20:03.981 --> 20:06.501
I remember a lot of things.

20:13.299 --> 20:16.681
All right, the maintenance
elevator is that way.

20:43.958 --> 20:45.424
Oh, my God.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.642
They're planting bombs.

20:47.667 --> 20:49.426
The attack isn't just on SIOC.

20:49.451 --> 20:51.574
They're trying to take
down the whole building.

20:56.410 --> 20:57.560
Clear.

20:57.585 --> 20:58.792
I should have thought of this.

20:58.817 --> 21:00.175
Last year, Homeland Security

21:00.191 --> 21:02.283
centralized protection
for federal buildings

21:02.308 --> 21:05.041
they considered high value
and high-risk targets.

21:05.066 --> 21:06.720
They're all accessible from my lab.

21:06.722 --> 21:08.541
We have to assume Shepherd's
gonna attack each and every one.

21:08.566 --> 21:09.769
We gotta evacuate.

21:09.794 --> 21:11.460
We'll never reach all
the buildings in time.

21:11.485 --> 21:13.908
We only need to reach one.
DHS headquarters in Washington.

21:13.933 --> 21:15.970
How? All of our comms are still out.

21:15.995 --> 21:18.275
Sandstorm hardwired
into our security hub

21:18.300 --> 21:19.681
to cheat that video feed.

21:19.706 --> 21:20.901
There's a pretty good chance

21:20.904 --> 21:22.386
they hardwired their
signal-jammers, too.

21:22.411 --> 21:25.160
So if we fry the lab, we can get
to Shepherd and get a call out.

21:26.573 --> 21:28.681
The only way to defuse these bombs

21:28.706 --> 21:30.683
is by removing the trigger chip.

21:31.114 --> 21:33.683
And that is protected...

21:33.708 --> 21:36.035
by an anti-tamper device.

21:37.979 --> 21:40.978
- Now, usually, we'd use a robot.
- And we don't have a robot,

21:41.003 --> 21:43.306
- so we're gonna have to do it by hand.
- Yeah.

21:43.331 --> 21:45.393
My hands don't fit, so...

21:45.395 --> 21:46.894
Okay. Okay.

21:46.896 --> 21:49.019
Uh, just walk me through it.

21:50.358 --> 21:52.389
You're gonna put your hand
through that little gap.

21:52.422 --> 21:54.672
Pull out the tamper
bar. It's asymmetrical,

21:54.697 --> 21:56.741
so you gotta twist it
and turn it to remove it.

21:56.766 --> 21:59.149
But you have to avoid
touching the contact points.

21:59.174 --> 22:00.506
Right.

22:01.187 --> 22:02.975
It's like the game of Operation.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.983
If the bar touches the sides, game over.

22:06.071 --> 22:07.811
I never played Operation.

22:07.836 --> 22:10.203
You don't know that. You might've.

22:10.228 --> 22:13.281
Could be one of your
hidden talents, huh?

22:14.789 --> 22:16.305
All right.

22:17.375 --> 22:19.660
I'm glad to hear your
memories are returning.

22:19.685 --> 22:21.079
Are you?

22:23.329 --> 22:25.772
Everything I've done,

22:25.797 --> 22:27.451
I've done for love.

22:27.476 --> 22:31.016
Does that include trying to kill me?

22:32.671 --> 22:35.234
Why did you choose Jane over me?

22:36.633 --> 22:39.858
You didn't choose Remi,
Remi was gone. You know that.

22:39.883 --> 22:42.037
You chose a stranger.

22:42.062 --> 22:44.149
Over your own mother.

22:44.821 --> 22:46.054
Why?

22:47.957 --> 22:50.829
Because Jane wasn't asking me to choose.

22:55.131 --> 22:58.610
This isn't supposed
to have gone this way.

22:58.635 --> 23:00.368
Well, if it's any consolation,

23:00.370 --> 23:03.272
things didn't exactly
turn out for me either.

23:03.943 --> 23:07.375
We were supposed to do this together.

23:07.377 --> 23:09.264
All three of us,

23:09.289 --> 23:11.366
side by side.

23:12.013 --> 23:15.014
History was supposed to know my family.

23:18.703 --> 23:21.195
Patterson's delay is almost finished.

23:21.762 --> 23:23.133
It's time.

23:31.813 --> 23:34.063
I have to go now, Roman.

23:34.759 --> 23:36.798
Would you like to stay here...

23:37.572 --> 23:39.626
or would you care to join me?

23:45.907 --> 23:47.624
Gentle, gentle.

23:47.649 --> 23:48.697
There you go.

23:48.722 --> 23:49.882
Ooh.

23:49.907 --> 23:51.642
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

23:52.723 --> 23:53.889
Be gentle.

23:56.219 --> 23:58.618
There you go. Nice.

23:59.923 --> 24:02.149
There you go. Deactivated.

24:02.174 --> 24:03.225
Huh.

24:03.250 --> 24:04.759
Can't be the only one
that they've planted.

24:04.784 --> 24:06.467
Now we got to figure out
where the rest are hidden.

24:09.283 --> 24:11.157
The red tape in the replica gym.

24:11.182 --> 24:13.951
The gym's right next to the main
support columns of this building.

24:13.976 --> 24:17.178
If Sandstorm planted bombs
next to that and here,

24:17.180 --> 24:18.979
that's all they need to
make this building implode.

24:18.981 --> 24:20.712
One down, one to go.

24:22.173 --> 24:24.285
30 seconds, everyone to their station.

24:24.310 --> 24:25.984
Wait.

24:26.009 --> 24:27.788
The bombs in the
sub-basement are offline.

24:27.790 --> 24:30.048
What? How is that possible?

24:30.767 --> 24:32.760
Do we still have a secure frequency,

24:32.762 --> 24:34.161
or are we failing on every front?

24:34.186 --> 24:35.445
You're secure.

24:35.470 --> 24:37.602
Bravo Point, do you copy?

24:38.501 --> 24:40.434
Sub-basement team, do you copy?

24:43.946 --> 24:46.321
The prodigal daughter returns.

24:47.377 --> 24:49.977
So much for not being a problem.

24:50.985 --> 24:53.314
They're heading to
the gym. Take them out.

24:53.316 --> 24:55.429
Make sure that bomb
goes off as scheduled.

24:55.454 --> 24:56.920
Go.

24:58.637 --> 25:00.570
You're gonna kill them.

25:00.838 --> 25:02.538
Do you have a problem with that?

25:04.627 --> 25:06.181
That's it.

25:06.206 --> 25:07.937
The migration's finalized.

25:07.962 --> 25:09.397
All my systems are back online.

25:09.399 --> 25:11.132
Okay. Do it.

25:11.134 --> 25:12.892
Search the lab.

25:14.036 --> 25:15.587
Okay.

25:15.638 --> 25:16.954
- It's just...
- What are you waiting on?

25:16.979 --> 25:18.306
We'll buy you a new lab, Patterson.

25:18.331 --> 25:19.997
No, no, no, it's... it's...

25:20.022 --> 25:23.287
The full surge won't be instantaneous.

25:23.289 --> 25:24.955
The second I start this process,

25:24.980 --> 25:27.361
Shepherd will figure
out what I'm doing...

25:27.386 --> 25:29.171
and know where we are.

25:29.196 --> 25:31.104
They will come right for us

25:31.129 --> 25:33.308
and this room is completely exposed.

25:33.333 --> 25:35.033
We'll buy you as much time as we can.

25:37.384 --> 25:39.189
Start the search.

25:50.206 --> 25:52.673
That's all the buildings on Homeland
Security's centralized server.

25:52.675 --> 25:56.049
Start with the federal targets
on the East Coast and move west.

25:57.784 --> 25:59.680
What the hell was that?

25:59.682 --> 26:01.649
The first wave.

26:01.651 --> 26:04.051
Patterson's shorting out
the lab from the server room.

26:04.053 --> 26:06.376
- We are out of time.
- I need seven minutes.

26:06.401 --> 26:08.620
Yeah, well, we've
got, like, three. Move.

26:08.659 --> 26:10.391
That's not enough time to get
our men into every building.

26:10.393 --> 26:12.760
Then we'll have to
breach the ones we can.

26:12.762 --> 26:14.456
Would you take care of Patterson?

26:14.481 --> 26:15.753
Now.

26:19.025 --> 26:20.666
Quantico, huh?

26:21.276 --> 26:22.770
You really want to talk about this now?

26:22.772 --> 26:24.071
There might not be another time,

26:24.073 --> 26:25.506
and I don't want to
die with you thinking

26:25.508 --> 26:27.485
I agree with your dumb idea to leave.

26:27.510 --> 26:29.525
Look, if I can't do the job
the way I was doing it before,

26:29.550 --> 26:31.250
I shouldn't be doing it at all.

26:31.275 --> 26:32.847
You think you can be a good agent

26:32.849 --> 26:34.448
because you feel something?

26:34.450 --> 26:36.584
Understanding, identifying with victims,

26:36.586 --> 26:38.563
that's what makes you good at your job.

26:55.478 --> 26:57.232
All yours.

27:06.382 --> 27:08.242
They know that we're here.

27:08.267 --> 27:09.933
Go. I got this.

27:12.388 --> 27:14.252
Jane?

27:14.277 --> 27:16.711
- Don't die.
- You, too.

28:00.685 --> 28:02.114
Thanks.

28:10.864 --> 28:12.947
Quantico is starting to
sound like a great idea.

28:12.949 --> 28:14.515
Maybe I'll put in for a transfer.

28:14.517 --> 28:17.223
I'll make sure I'll write you a
hell of a recommendation letter.

28:41.716 --> 28:42.949
Clear!

28:44.490 --> 28:45.622
Clear.

28:59.055 --> 29:00.501
Tasha!

29:03.966 --> 29:05.175
Are you okay?

29:05.200 --> 29:06.683
Yeah. You're hit.

29:14.348 --> 29:16.168
Come on, come on, come on...

29:16.193 --> 29:17.981
Department of Homeland Security.

29:18.006 --> 29:21.388
Uh, this is Special Agent Patterson
of the FBI's New York office,

29:21.413 --> 29:23.695
I.D. code JLTP15.

29:23.720 --> 29:24.903
We're under attack.

29:24.928 --> 29:26.496
You need to evacuate every building

29:26.521 --> 29:29.340
connected to central
security server immediately.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.830
That's it? It's over?

29:33.855 --> 29:36.908
Well, things didn't go
exactly as I planned.

29:36.933 --> 29:38.899
We have to go now.

29:38.901 --> 29:40.799
There's only one way out.

29:40.824 --> 29:43.283
And I'm gonna need my son back.

30:01.081 --> 30:02.556
Why should I trust you?

30:02.558 --> 30:04.900
Because you can't afford not to.

30:04.925 --> 30:07.428
Because staying here means
living the rest of your life

30:07.430 --> 30:10.464
in a cold, dark box alone.

30:28.217 --> 30:30.595
We're all we have left in this world.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.808
- You tried to kill me.
- You tried to kill me first.

30:32.824 --> 30:34.467
You've been controlling
me my entire life.

30:34.469 --> 30:37.100
Trying to control you and
keeping you under control

30:37.125 --> 30:39.417
are two very different things.

30:40.753 --> 30:44.290
Losing Remi was a risk
inherent to the plan.

30:44.315 --> 30:46.511
We all knew that going in.

30:47.273 --> 30:49.401
Losing you was...

30:52.194 --> 30:54.561
something I was not prepared for.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.837
Give me one reason I should
listen to anything you say.

30:56.862 --> 30:59.015
Because I'm your mother.

31:02.723 --> 31:04.790
I love you, Roman.

31:05.832 --> 31:07.251
I saved you.

31:08.145 --> 31:09.511
I raised you.

31:09.513 --> 31:12.847
I protected you, even when it hurt.

31:13.441 --> 31:15.758
Is it loaded this time?

31:17.487 --> 31:19.501
Only one way to find out.

31:24.695 --> 31:27.562
They were able to
evacuate the high val...

31:27.564 --> 31:29.998
Tasha! No-no-no-no-no.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.700
She's lost a lot of blood.
We can't risk moving her.

31:31.702 --> 31:32.996
I'll radio...

31:33.021 --> 31:35.488
- I'll radio for help.
- Go, go!

31:35.513 --> 31:38.417
You gotta go. You gotta protect her.

31:38.442 --> 31:39.816
No, no, I'm not gonna
leave your side, all right?

31:39.841 --> 31:41.107
I'm gonna be right here with you.

31:41.132 --> 31:42.223
All right, I'm not gonna leave you.

31:42.248 --> 31:43.558
You just gotta stay with me.

31:43.583 --> 31:46.238
Agents down, we need
immediate medical response.

31:46.256 --> 31:48.590
Patterson, it's Weller and
Jane. We're in the building.

31:48.621 --> 31:50.550
Weller, Tasha's down,
she's bleeding out.

31:50.575 --> 31:52.230
And multiple other agents are down, too.

31:52.255 --> 31:53.582
All right, all units have a green light

31:53.607 --> 31:55.111
to breach the tunnel
and enter the building.

31:55.136 --> 31:57.227
Patterson. Take care of Tasha.

31:57.252 --> 31:58.652
We got Shepherd.

31:59.982 --> 32:01.482
Roman.

32:16.699 --> 32:18.065
This is Borden's lab.

32:18.067 --> 32:19.500
He backed us into a kill box.

32:19.502 --> 32:20.901
We're trapped!

32:28.583 --> 32:30.873
They're never gonna
surrender, you know that.

32:30.898 --> 32:32.831
So you know what that means.

32:34.599 --> 32:37.547
Jane... you take Shepherd.

32:37.572 --> 32:38.974
Thanks.

32:40.323 --> 32:41.589
Good?

32:43.102 --> 32:44.268
Breach it.

32:56.239 --> 32:57.713
Room is clear.

32:57.738 --> 32:59.840
- Where are they?
- Gone.

33:13.997 --> 33:16.524
All units, stay sharp
and keep your eyes peeled.

33:16.526 --> 33:19.286
Two suspects have used a heating
shaft to escape the building.

33:19.311 --> 33:20.864
They are armed and dangerous.

33:20.889 --> 33:22.429
It was Borden.

33:22.454 --> 33:24.452
The entire time he was in here.

33:24.477 --> 33:26.286
Engineering their escape.

33:39.839 --> 33:41.728
They all said that he
was a stubborn bastard

33:41.753 --> 33:43.417
right till the end.

33:46.971 --> 33:49.037
I'm sure he gave him hell.

33:51.100 --> 33:52.603
Hey.

33:52.628 --> 33:54.128
Hey.

33:54.130 --> 33:55.871
Uh...

33:55.896 --> 33:58.723
uh, Shepherd overrode DHS defenses

33:58.748 --> 34:00.004
and tried to muscle her way

34:00.029 --> 34:02.446
into six other federal
buildings with explosives,

34:02.471 --> 34:03.971
just like she did here.

34:03.973 --> 34:05.237
Tried to?

34:05.262 --> 34:07.274
Getting the word out...

34:07.276 --> 34:11.027
allowed Homeland Security to
stop four other attacks, but...

34:12.362 --> 34:14.400
two buildings just came down.

34:14.426 --> 34:16.918
One in Boston, one in San Francisco.

34:16.943 --> 34:18.098
Oh, my God.

34:18.123 --> 34:20.431
Law enforcement casualties
are still being tallied,

34:20.456 --> 34:23.284
but... they're minimal.

34:23.310 --> 34:25.710
How many civilian casualties?

34:27.530 --> 34:29.097
None.

34:29.121 --> 34:31.455
They were all evacuated in time.

34:33.204 --> 34:35.304
So we saved thousands of lives.

34:35.329 --> 34:38.262
Unfortunately, that's not
what people will remember.

34:44.797 --> 34:46.598
I'm sorry you can't go home.

34:46.600 --> 34:48.699
Shepherd and Roman are still out there.

34:48.702 --> 34:50.839
The National Guard, they
have a ten-block perimeter

34:50.864 --> 34:52.518
around this building.

34:53.340 --> 34:55.774
- You're safe here.
- Safe.

34:58.379 --> 35:01.315
How is anyone ever
gonna feel safe again?

35:05.119 --> 35:08.587
And my family is responsible.

35:09.643 --> 35:11.354
All of us.

35:12.862 --> 35:14.478
- No.
- Yes.

35:14.503 --> 35:17.604
Me, Shepherd, and Roman.

35:18.269 --> 35:20.132
He chose her.

35:20.134 --> 35:22.134
After everything we did.

35:22.136 --> 35:23.669
It didn't matter.

35:25.940 --> 35:29.948
I saw all the signs, I
just kept pushing them away.

35:30.738 --> 35:32.488
Kurt, what if it's only a matter of time

35:32.513 --> 35:34.605
before I become like that?

35:36.150 --> 35:38.483
We're not our families.

35:40.154 --> 35:42.621
Jane, I know who you are.

35:46.560 --> 35:50.245
That is not who you are.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.013
Assistant Director Weller?

36:08.015 --> 36:09.414
Yeah.

36:09.416 --> 36:10.916
Secret Service, sir.

36:10.918 --> 36:12.608
You need to come with us.

36:14.688 --> 36:17.018
I'm not leaving my people.

36:17.575 --> 36:20.065
It's a matter of national security, sir.

36:21.525 --> 36:23.346
Kurt, you have to go.

36:25.019 --> 36:26.385
It's okay.

36:38.045 --> 36:39.395
You sure about this?

36:39.420 --> 36:41.513
Everyone will know your face, your name.

36:41.515 --> 36:42.948
There's no going back.

36:42.950 --> 36:44.516
That's the point.

36:52.626 --> 36:54.026
Hello.

36:54.028 --> 36:56.662
My name is Major General Ellen Briggs,

36:56.664 --> 36:58.463
but you can call me Shepherd.

36:58.465 --> 37:02.706
I am responsible for today's
attacks on American soil...

37:02.731 --> 37:04.829
and so are you.

37:04.854 --> 37:07.730
This country was founded on fairness,

37:07.755 --> 37:09.550
integrity,

37:09.575 --> 37:11.643
but it's been corrupted.

37:12.214 --> 37:14.980
Our leaders have failed us.

37:14.982 --> 37:17.416
They will call me a
terrorist for what I've done,

37:17.418 --> 37:20.915
but I am and always have been a patriot.

37:20.940 --> 37:23.431
This is a call to arms,

37:23.456 --> 37:26.058
to stand up, to fight,

37:26.060 --> 37:29.928
because true freedom cannot
come without true sacrifice,

37:29.930 --> 37:32.664
because no matter what flag they wield,

37:32.666 --> 37:35.074
those who oppose that freedom...

37:35.099 --> 37:36.901
are our enemy now.

37:36.926 --> 37:41.250
These chairs are for those we have lost

37:41.252 --> 37:43.597
and for those who will follow,

37:43.622 --> 37:46.034
who will take up the fight.

37:46.413 --> 37:49.659
This is the dawn of a new America.

37:49.684 --> 37:52.846
It's time to take back our country.

38:03.265 --> 38:05.226
Send this to the
"Times" tomorrow morning.

38:05.251 --> 38:07.569
It sounded like a victory speech.

38:08.444 --> 38:10.226
We lost today, didn't we?

38:26.085 --> 38:27.385
This is as far as we go.

38:27.410 --> 38:29.476
Surrender your phone and gun, sir.

38:30.424 --> 38:32.124
I'm not surrendering anything.

38:32.126 --> 38:33.352
These are standard

38:33.377 --> 38:35.270
Deputies Committee
security protocols, sir.

38:35.295 --> 38:36.962
All you have to do is sign.

38:36.964 --> 38:38.930
Security credentials
for Deputies Committee.

38:38.955 --> 38:40.462
Let's do this.

39:18.406 --> 39:21.576
Assistant Director Weller, welcome.

39:21.608 --> 39:24.062
Now that we're all here, we can begin.

39:24.664 --> 39:27.012
For those of you who are first-timers,

39:27.014 --> 39:28.468
the answers to your many questions

39:28.493 --> 39:31.227
will be found inside your metal folders.

39:31.695 --> 39:33.452
As the rest of you know,

39:33.454 --> 39:36.179
we are a faction of
the Deputies Committee

39:36.657 --> 39:39.391
who assemble in the face of
national security threats,

39:39.393 --> 39:42.484
such as the coordinated
attacks on this country today.

39:43.023 --> 39:45.730
This is the Continuity of
Government Subcommittee,

39:45.755 --> 39:47.039
or COGS.

39:47.064 --> 39:48.265
Follow the cogs.

39:48.290 --> 39:49.882
It's just something I
heard Shepherd say once.

39:49.907 --> 39:51.214
Didn't hear the context.

39:51.239 --> 39:53.449
Each of us is a designated deputy

39:53.474 --> 39:55.343
of a key federal agency.

39:57.044 --> 39:58.656
The CDC...

39:58.681 --> 39:59.914
This is Julia Chang.

39:59.953 --> 40:01.343
What do these numbers mean?

40:01.368 --> 40:03.515
All the vials from the
tattoos are missing.

40:04.781 --> 40:05.947
... the DEA...

40:05.972 --> 40:08.070
- I trusted you.
- Just let me explain.

40:09.262 --> 40:10.928
... the USAF...

40:10.930 --> 40:12.263
... the CIA...

40:12.265 --> 40:15.201
I'm a company man. Jay Keaton, CIA.

40:15.226 --> 40:17.935
I believe you knew my
predecessor, Tom Carter.

40:17.937 --> 40:19.812
... the FBI.

40:20.929 --> 40:24.428
Thankfully, the levers of
power are still in place,

40:24.453 --> 40:28.046
but in the case of another
more devastating attack...

40:28.921 --> 40:31.226
Her body is covered in cryptic symbols,

40:31.259 --> 40:32.857
map pieces, riddles.

40:32.882 --> 40:35.178
Whoever did this to her has
a very specific goal in mind.

40:35.203 --> 40:36.804
Jane's tattoos, they
seem to be pointing us

40:36.829 --> 40:38.078
towards government corruption.

40:38.103 --> 40:41.685
I'm making you the new
permanent director of the NYO.

40:41.710 --> 40:44.678
It is our sworn duty
to remain in this bunker

40:44.680 --> 40:46.713
until otherwise notified,

40:46.715 --> 40:50.083
in preparation to enact
the Truman protocol,

40:50.085 --> 40:53.037
wherein, by order of the president,

40:53.062 --> 40:57.085
we alone become the successors
to the United States government.

40:57.859 --> 40:59.726
Thank you.

40:59.728 --> 41:01.460
This is everything.

41:02.728 --> 41:04.094
What?

41:06.678 --> 41:08.412
Jane.

41:08.437 --> 41:09.992
The tattoos.

41:10.987 --> 41:13.007
This is what it's all for.

41:13.585 --> 41:15.506
What are you talking about?

41:15.531 --> 41:18.374
All of us that are
locked inside this bunker,

41:18.898 --> 41:21.585
we're the cogs Shepherd
needs to enable...

41:21.610 --> 41:23.547
the Truman protocol.

41:24.651 --> 41:26.684
- We're phase two.
- No, no, no.

41:26.709 --> 41:28.376
The phase two attack already happened.

41:28.401 --> 41:29.921
- We stopped it.
