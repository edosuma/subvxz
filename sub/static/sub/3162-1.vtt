<i>When I was a boy, Tickle Head
was a proud fishing harbour.</i>

02:35.781 --> 02:40.660
<i>Back then, people from Tickle Head
were strong, dignified, brave.</i>

02:40.661 --> 02:43.739
<i>Their days were filled with purpose.</i>

02:52.881 --> 02:55.716
<i>By no means was this life
for the faint at heart,</i>

02:55.717 --> 02:58.215
<i>for the weak or the lazy.</i>

02:58.553 --> 03:02.302
<i>But as I look back now,
I can truly say...</i>

03:02.557 --> 03:04.759
<i>life was a thing of beauty.</i>

03:19.157 --> 03:24.863
<i>My father would labour 14 hours
a day till his hands were raw,</i>

03:25.747 --> 03:29.667
<i>risking life and limb,
fighting the merciless sea,</i>

03:30.127 --> 03:32.420
<i>all to put food on the table,</i>

03:32.421 --> 03:34.588
<i>a roof over our heads,</i>

03:34.589 --> 03:37.091
<i>warmth in our stove.</i>

03:40.721 --> 03:43.681
<i>At day's end, my father
glowed with pride</i>

03:43.682 --> 03:48.307
<i>because he knew, deep
down, he'd earned it.</i>

03:48.603 --> 03:53.149
<i>He earned every precious, beautiful
moment life gave back to him.</i>

03:55.152 --> 03:58.320
<i>'Cause he knew his hard
work made him worthy,</i>

03:58.321 --> 04:02.901
<i>worthy of the cod on his plate,
the smell of the salt on his skin,</i>

04:03.326 --> 04:06.028
<i>worthy of the stars in the sky.</i>

04:09.666 --> 04:11.625
Oh, Ernest!

04:11.626 --> 04:13.544
Alice!

04:15.714 --> 04:19.543
The whole harbour was worthy of
every consequence of happiness.

04:21.344 --> 04:24.346
There were even some who believed
they were more worthy than others.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.556
True happiness.

04:40.572 --> 04:42.656
Meow!

04:42.657 --> 04:47.453
Meow! Meow!

04:54.795 --> 04:58.499
Murray, stop buggin' the cat.

05:23.365 --> 05:26.033
- Mornin', Anne.
- Hey, how's it going?

05:32.499 --> 05:34.667
Ah!

05:34.668 --> 05:36.790
- Mornin', Sammy.
- Thanks.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.584
Mornin', Seez.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.382
Heya, Frankie.

05:41.383 --> 05:42.675
There you are, my love.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.717
Thanks, Kath.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.678
Mornin', Murray.

05:45.679 --> 05:50.634
Thank you, and Mr. Pelley asked
me to pick up his welfare cheque.

05:51.893 --> 05:53.477
There you go.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.145
- Thank you.
- Have a good one.

05:55.146 --> 05:58.019
- Catch you later.
- Mornin', Joe.

05:58.149 --> 06:01.819
Thank you. Wonderful.

06:02.320 --> 06:05.614
There you go. Have a nice day,
and don't forget the town meeting, okay?

06:05.615 --> 06:07.283
- Thanks, Henry.
- Next.

06:07.284 --> 06:10.327
This is my cheque, and this
is Mr. Pelley's cheque.

06:10.328 --> 06:13.080
Murray, now, we've been through this.
I've explained this to you...

06:13.081 --> 06:14.828
We go through this every month.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.500
- I could lose my job.
- You will not lose your job.

06:16.501 --> 06:18.669
You have seen Mr. Pelley's
power of attorney.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.129
It's fraudulent!

06:20.130 --> 06:22.423
- This is totally legal.
- This is illegal!

06:31.683 --> 06:33.475
Thanks.

06:33.560 --> 06:37.146
And don't forget the town
meeting, okay? Next.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.001
Hey.

06:59.002 --> 07:03.127
- My brother called.
- Oh yeah?

07:03.924 --> 07:06.968
- How's he doing?
- Good.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.846
There's a job available
in St. John's.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.560
Of course! You prefer to stay here.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.147
This is our home.

07:20.148 --> 07:23.897
You prefer to stay here and
live like thieves, Murray.

07:24.361 --> 07:27.821
- Thieves?
- You steal from the cable company!

07:27.822 --> 07:31.116
- You rigged up our electrical box!
- That wasn't on purpose.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.160
You sell the salmon you
catch in your herring nets

07:33.161 --> 07:36.080
and you're still cashing that second
illegal welfare cheque every month.

07:36.081 --> 07:38.408
Illegal?

07:41.252 --> 07:44.755
This is a power of attorney.
It is written in black and white.

07:44.756 --> 07:46.590
It is my duty and moral obligation

07:46.591 --> 07:49.927
to pick up and to deposit
Mr. Pelley's welfare cheque.

07:49.928 --> 07:53.555
It is Mr. Pelley himself who wrote
this particular power of attorney.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.724
Mr. Pelley has given me a mission.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.476
Mr. Pelley's dead.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.938
Not in the government registry.

08:00.939 --> 08:06.485
Until Mr. Pelley is dead
everywhere, I have a moral duty.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.279
Murray, why does this always
have to be your decision?

08:09.280 --> 08:11.782
'Cause I'd be the one
who'd be workin'!

08:11.783 --> 08:13.575
This job is for me, Murray.

08:14.119 --> 08:16.742
I'd be the one who'd be workin'.

08:20.542 --> 08:23.210
- Murray...
- It's the town meeting.

08:23.211 --> 08:25.083
Murray...

08:27.382 --> 08:29.755
What am I gonna tell my brother?

08:29.884 --> 08:31.301
Murray!

08:38.852 --> 08:42.229
- Where is everyone?
- Stuck in traffic.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.239
Murray?

08:52.240 --> 08:56.076
Murray? This is quite the surprise.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.911
Shag off.

08:57.912 --> 08:59.784
All right.

08:59.914 --> 09:03.125
Now, the company is still considering
our proposal for the factory.

09:03.126 --> 09:06.295
So I offered them a full tax
exemption to sweeten the deal.

09:06.296 --> 09:10.424
Uh... tax exemption? Why would
you give them a full tax exemption?

09:10.425 --> 09:12.718
I mean, 2% less than Port
Anne would've enticed them.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.887
Enticed them? Enticed them?

09:14.888 --> 09:18.515
Henry, I didn't want to entice
them, I wanted to blind them!

09:18.516 --> 09:21.685
I wanted to blind them so they wouldn't
notice the gaping holes in our bid.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.937
Yeah but a full tax exemption?

09:23.938 --> 09:26.023
But that's not the problem
anyway, 'cause...

09:26.024 --> 09:28.609
- But for how many years?
- Forever, Henry, forever.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.277
- 'Cause the real problem is...
- But I...

09:30.278 --> 09:33.030
Forever! I offered them
full tax exemption forever

09:33.031 --> 09:35.491
and I threw in your
daughter's virginity.

09:35.492 --> 09:38.243
What the hell are you talkin' about?

09:38.244 --> 09:43.165
Oh, Henry, Tom is pulling your leg. Everyone
knows Lucy gave that away long ago.

09:43.541 --> 09:47.377
Look, the tax exemption and his
daughter's virginity are irrelevant.

09:47.378 --> 09:49.338
Why?

09:49.339 --> 09:53.300
The company insurance requires that
the town have a resident doctor.

09:53.301 --> 09:56.303
No doctor, no factory.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.597
So why don't...
Let's just get a doctor.

09:58.598 --> 10:02.101
We've been looking for eight
friggin' years, Murray!

10:02.102 --> 10:05.396
Well, let's stop lookin'
and start findin'!

10:06.314 --> 10:08.524
You're our mayor, right?
You're "the" guy.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.317
I know you can do this!

10:10.318 --> 10:12.645
You said you would and you will!

10:16.556 --> 10:20.306
What would Barb be doin' in town?

10:20.453 --> 10:22.788
She won't be going to town.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.290
Well, if she goes, though.

10:25.291 --> 10:29.916
If she goes,
where will it leave you?

10:29.963 --> 10:32.256
- What do you mean?
- Well, she'll be working.

10:32.257 --> 10:36.257
Where will that leave you?
What will be your role?

10:36.886 --> 10:41.557
You'll become the new
little missus, I guess.

10:44.435 --> 10:46.854
I guess you'll be shopping

10:46.855 --> 10:50.482
and doing the cooking,
laundry and the gossiping.

10:50.483 --> 10:55.359
They... they sometimes like to
do arts and crafts together.

10:56.072 --> 11:00.993
They do yoga sessions.
Oh my God, you'll love yoga, boy.

11:00.994 --> 11:04.117
Great for the posture.

11:05.331 --> 11:12.004
She'll be the new boss,
in a sexual perspective now.

11:14.966 --> 11:17.760
Who'll be doing the driving?

11:21.014 --> 11:22.848
She won't be goin' to town.

11:24.475 --> 11:27.052
Come on, now! Another tune!

11:27.395 --> 11:29.479
<i>Farewell darling</i>

11:29.480 --> 11:31.565
<i>And don't you grieve for me...</i>

11:34.068 --> 11:35.152
Murray!

12:33.044 --> 12:35.212
- Lizzy, grab the box.
- With all that stuff?

12:35.213 --> 12:36.463
Yes, grab the bottom.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.131
Okay.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.560
Oh, thank you, darlin'.

12:50.561 --> 12:53.138
- Murray!
- What's goin' on?

12:56.943 --> 12:58.777
Holidays.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.355
Holiday?

13:05.410 --> 13:07.737
With your furniture?

13:08.329 --> 13:12.082
I got a job in town.
You knows what it's like, Murray.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.584
And young Lizzie there
desperately needs braces.

13:14.585 --> 13:17.045
You can't do it here so...
She's got horrible teeth.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.089
- She's got her mother's teeth.
- Thank you, Tom.

13:19.090 --> 13:20.549
Honey, you know what I mean.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.884
- Of course, I'm ugly.
- Sheryl!

13:22.885 --> 13:26.263
- At least she doesn't have your ears.
- Don't start with my ears!

13:26.264 --> 13:29.092
What about the factory, Mr. Mayor?

13:31.644 --> 13:34.722
Enjoy your holiday, buddy.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.116
You leavin' me?

13:46.117 --> 13:49.491
I'm not leavin' you, Murray.
I'm goin' to work.

13:53.166 --> 13:56.460
We're this close to
gettin' a doctor.

13:56.627 --> 14:00.171
I don't like what
we've become, Murray.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.509
These are tough times.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.012
It's not the times.

14:07.013 --> 14:10.140
It's us. I don't recognize us.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.315
Barb!

14:35.750 --> 14:37.751
This is it, Simon.

14:37.752 --> 14:41.831
This is it. I'm leavin'.

14:45.968 --> 14:48.762
Will you come visit me in town?

14:49.305 --> 14:51.723
Nope.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.892
Simon.

14:54.685 --> 14:58.184
- I'm afraid of flyin'.
- Yeah, well, drive down.

14:58.189 --> 15:00.232
I don't drive.

15:00.691 --> 15:04.895
I'm serious. I'm gonna need you to
come visit me from time to time.

15:05.196 --> 15:07.193
I won't.

15:07.782 --> 15:10.325
Take the bus.

15:10.326 --> 15:13.654
I do not know how to take the bus.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.916
Well, then how do you go to town?

15:18.709 --> 15:22.379
I've never been to town.

15:23.172 --> 15:26.633
- Never?
- No.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.885
You've never been to town?

15:28.886 --> 15:30.678
Nope!

15:34.809 --> 15:37.227
Lucky dog.

15:40.148 --> 15:42.896
Lucky dog.

15:55.413 --> 15:58.498
Welcome to St. John's
International Airport.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.126
For passengers making
a connecting flight...

16:01.127 --> 16:03.625
No, no...

16:03.754 --> 16:06.422
Okay, no, I'm not still drunk.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.418
No, I'm not.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.344
Babe, honestly, I don't know
what else to say. I said I'm sorry.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.763
I'll say it again, I'm sorry.
I unfortunately missed my flight.

16:13.764 --> 16:15.932
I just paid an astronomical
amount of money

16:15.933 --> 16:18.101
to get on the next, which I will.

16:18.102 --> 16:20.437
I have 35 minutes to
make my connection.

16:20.438 --> 16:22.230
Bye, Paul.

16:23.691 --> 16:24.858
- Hey, boss.
- Hey.

16:24.859 --> 16:26.606
Hold on one sec.

16:27.862 --> 16:30.155
- Can I get you to go this way, please?
- What?

16:30.156 --> 16:32.157
- Just over this way.
- No, no, no, sir.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.783
- This way, sir.
- I got a connection.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.952
Just over here, sir.

16:35.995 --> 16:40.074
Right. That's awesome. This is good.

16:43.211 --> 16:45.163
Shorts.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.374
That's a shirt.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.928
Those are, uh, cricket balls.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.890
- Cricket?
- Yeah, I play cricket.

16:56.891 --> 17:00.977
Just won a tournament. Hence the
trophy and the hangover, sir.

17:00.978 --> 17:02.646
I'm kind of in a rush, you know?

17:02.647 --> 17:06.525
- I got a flight to catch...
- Sir, please.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.194
Sir, I'm a doctor, okay?
I'm due for surgery,

17:09.194 --> 17:12.948
and while you're itemizing my toiletries,
there's a young child named Jimmy

17:12.949 --> 17:15.742
that's pondering his
future as an amputee.

17:17.244 --> 17:20.329
He might lose his leg, sir.

17:20.330 --> 17:22.415
Jimmy might lose his leg,

17:22.415 --> 17:24.334
and I need to leave
immediately for Jimmy's sake.

17:24.335 --> 17:26.211
Right now, sir.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.380
Now, now! Right... Okay...

17:28.381 --> 17:31.841
Okay, that's cocaine.
That's cocaine. Okay?

17:31.842 --> 17:34.469
And I just finished my residency
as a plastic surgeon,

17:34.470 --> 17:37.305
and I am damn good and I can
fix anything you want for free.

17:37.306 --> 17:40.141
Free of charge, pro bono.
Maybe on your wife perhaps?

17:40.142 --> 17:41.977
Maybe she needs a fresh bosom,

17:41.978 --> 17:44.646
maybe a tuck to her rear,
make it sing again.

17:44.647 --> 17:46.189
I can work miracles, sir.

17:46.190 --> 17:48.650
Maybe I could fix...
I could fix your ears.

17:48.651 --> 17:50.853
Don't start with my ears.

17:51.988 --> 17:55.862
- So you're a doctor.
- Yes, sir.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.919
Where is everyone?

18:12.091 --> 18:14.301
It's that bloody traffic again.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.226
Sweet Jesus!

18:23.227 --> 18:25.687
Hear ye, hear ye!

18:31.319 --> 18:33.528
Hear ye, hear ye!

18:41.579 --> 18:44.953
Hear ye, goddammit, hear ye!

18:45.249 --> 18:48.247
Okay, I'm gonna tell you one
thing and it's not another!

18:49.295 --> 18:51.918
If you hear the church bell ringin'

18:52.214 --> 18:53.882
and it ain't the Sunday mornin',

18:53.883 --> 18:56.210
it's because of the town meetin'.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.257
And if there's a town meetin',

18:58.262 --> 19:00.722
it's because the town bloody
well needs a town meetin'!

19:00.723 --> 19:03.721
It's your civic duty to be there!

19:04.852 --> 19:06.436
Okay.

19:06.437 --> 19:09.139
First order of business.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.524
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am pleased to announce

19:11.525 --> 19:15.528
that a doctor is comin' to
Tickle Head for one month.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.656
We have exactly one month

19:17.657 --> 19:21.409
to convince our good
doctor to sign long term.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.870
Because we have just heard

19:23.871 --> 19:26.956
that if the doctor chooses
to stay here in Tickle Head,

19:26.957 --> 19:28.874
we gets the factory!

19:30.044 --> 19:31.996
Eh?

19:32.546 --> 19:35.340
We get a doctor,
the factory is a done deal.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.634
- Ah!
- Right?

19:37.635 --> 19:40.887
- Done deal!
- What is this factory?

19:40.888 --> 19:44.849
Herbert, we have been
through this 100 times.

19:44.850 --> 19:49.100
It is a petrochemical by-product
repurposing facility.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.391
What does the factory make?

19:52.566 --> 19:55.018
It's very simple, Herbert.

19:55.152 --> 19:58.613
They take petrochemical waste
from the oil rigs and such

19:58.614 --> 20:00.198
and, uh...

20:00.199 --> 20:02.075
I don't know. They make jobs.

20:02.076 --> 20:04.828
They make full-time
jobs for everyone.

20:04.829 --> 20:07.455
Who wants to earn a paycheque?

20:07.456 --> 20:10.125
Who wants to shove the welfare cheque
right up the government's arse?

20:10.126 --> 20:12.248
Who wants to work again?

20:20.136 --> 20:24.841
Well, raise your hands.
Raise your hands!

20:25.349 --> 20:27.934
There you go! Yes!
Raise your hands, yes!

20:27.935 --> 20:30.057
Yes!

20:35.985 --> 20:37.610
Okay.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.529
Now, we have one month

20:39.530 --> 20:43.992
to make our man here,
Dr. Paul Lewis, believe.

20:43.993 --> 20:47.287
One month to make him
believe like a child,

20:47.288 --> 20:53.168
believe that Tickle Head is the
finest place on Earth to call home.

20:55.546 --> 20:57.498
One month.

21:00.468 --> 21:03.052
There's a whole lot of stuff on
the beach. We can actually...

21:03.053 --> 21:06.014
We need a big, big cleanup.
We do need a big cleanup.

21:06.015 --> 21:08.391
We do. We gotta get some
young fellas out there.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.310
Murray, it's not a done deal.

21:10.311 --> 21:12.479
And then the whole
beautification process,

21:12.480 --> 21:16.483
you know, you were saying, like,
maybe paint her up a little bit and...

21:16.484 --> 21:18.526
But it has to be more
than that, you know?

21:18.527 --> 21:21.104
The whole harbour has to
be tailor-made for him.

21:21.906 --> 21:26.826
So we must have a
cocaine-friendly village.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.578
Murray, it's not a done deal.

21:28.579 --> 21:31.331
It's nowhere near being a done deal.

21:31.332 --> 21:32.957
I didn't say "done deal".

21:32.958 --> 21:34.667
Yeah, you said "done deal"!

21:34.668 --> 21:36.628
Well, I need people
to believe in this.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.463
Yeah, but it's a lie.

21:38.464 --> 21:41.174
Well, right now, lies is all we got.

21:41.175 --> 21:43.176
- It's gotta be love at first sight.
- That's right.

21:43.177 --> 21:45.299
Every detail is important.

21:45.930 --> 21:50.058
For example, Mr. Mayor said
the doctor loves cricket.

21:50.059 --> 21:51.893
- Cricket, cricket?
- Yeah.

21:51.894 --> 21:53.436
That's disgusting.

21:53.437 --> 21:55.897
- I mean, sushi is bad enough.
- No, cricket!

21:55.898 --> 21:57.440
The sport! Cricket!

21:57.441 --> 22:00.693
The sport, for God's sake!
The sport!

22:00.694 --> 22:02.737
They, like, race 'em?

22:03.155 --> 22:07.116
No, it's with a ball and the flat bat.
Have you never seen it?

22:07.117 --> 22:09.945
- No!
- It's a game.

22:10.287 --> 22:13.706
They must be some small
bats, what! Crickets!

22:13.707 --> 22:16.501
- Listen. Yeah, listen.
- What else we got?

22:16.502 --> 22:19.212
There's a whole slew of houses
down there that need some work...

22:19.213 --> 22:21.130
You know what would seduce him?

22:21.131 --> 22:23.800
You know what would
seduce him? Findin' money.

22:23.801 --> 22:25.176
What?

22:25.177 --> 22:27.637
Findin' money. Nothing
makes me happier.

22:27.638 --> 22:29.806
It's satisfying.

22:29.974 --> 22:34.143
I mean, you're walkin' along and then, bam,
there's 5 bucks just lying there, you know?

22:34.144 --> 22:36.437
You feel lucky.

22:37.022 --> 22:41.484
We have one chance at this.
Let's not mess it up.

22:41.485 --> 22:47.908
- You said small details!
- Henry, don't... mess... this... up.

23:04.091 --> 23:07.844
Well... one of the first
houses he'll see.

23:07.845 --> 23:09.762
I know.

23:10.514 --> 23:14.309
It does not give a good
first impression, boy.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.890
Bloody painful.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.690
Turn it! Turn it! Hold it!

23:22.109 --> 23:23.856
That's it, that's it!

23:25.779 --> 23:29.028
Right. So, here's
the cricket uniform.

23:30.367 --> 23:34.492
There's the cricket field...

23:35.748 --> 23:38.450
The rules...

23:38.792 --> 23:41.002
I could print it for ya.

23:41.003 --> 23:43.880
- Yeah. Mm-hmm!
- Yeah.

23:43.881 --> 23:46.966
Is there, uh, anything else?

23:50.054 --> 23:53.849
Can you show us some
photos of naughty nurses?

23:54.433 --> 23:56.434
Sure.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.768
- I got 'em.
- Great.

24:03.817 --> 24:07.521
All right, okay.

24:07.529 --> 24:11.282
Now, it is your civic duty

24:11.283 --> 24:16.120
to study these rules. We must
all become cricket aficionados.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.665
Put them out there. Here we go.

24:18.666 --> 24:22.210
It's kind of like baseball
but it's only got two bases

24:22.211 --> 24:24.462
and no one wears gloves.

24:24.463 --> 24:27.131
One guy wears a glove!

24:27.132 --> 24:29.175
One guy wears a glove.

24:33.889 --> 24:38.059
Now the cricket pitch is a circle
with a rectangle in the middle.

24:38.060 --> 24:40.353
You can do that, right?
You got lime?

24:40.354 --> 24:41.604
Sure, I got bags.

24:41.605 --> 24:43.852
All right, let's get to it.

24:46.986 --> 24:52.317
Oof! We're gonna need
a whole lot of whites.

24:52.491 --> 24:55.364
Where are we going to
get all these whites?

24:56.203 --> 24:57.904
Hmm...

25:09.091 --> 25:12.135
One, two, three.

25:24.940 --> 25:28.192
- These are pink!
- Yeah, we can just bleach 'em.

25:28.193 --> 25:31.779
- But these are pink!
- We can just bleach them!

25:31.780 --> 25:37.702
And so the doctor will be staying
in our beautiful home for a month.

25:37.703 --> 25:39.245
What about us?

25:39.246 --> 25:41.330
Oh, we'll be staying
with the Williamses.

25:46.086 --> 25:50.040
Anyone else have any announcements
they'd like to make?

25:50.591 --> 25:53.634
- Lucy?
- What?

25:53.635 --> 25:56.637
Anything anyone would like to share?

25:56.638 --> 25:59.807
News, updates?

26:00.225 --> 26:02.893
New milestones achieved?

26:03.270 --> 26:05.768
Barriers broken?

26:16.116 --> 26:19.535
- This is it.
- What?

26:21.914 --> 26:23.706
Huh?

26:23.707 --> 26:26.205
Sweet Jesus.

26:27.294 --> 26:30.122
Do we know how to hook it up?

26:30.839 --> 26:32.298
No idea.

26:32.299 --> 26:34.550
It's still very pink.

26:34.551 --> 26:37.020
That's not pink.

26:40.557 --> 26:42.509
It's pink.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.680
Even at night, it's horrendous.

27:26.061 --> 27:29.021
- What the hell are you talkin' about?
- Nothing, really.

27:29.022 --> 27:32.191
- Just, you know, everybody's pitchin' in.
- Yeah,

27:32.192 --> 27:34.986
- you're using my attic!
- Oh, well, we appreciate that,

27:34.987 --> 27:37.906
but this would really help,
and only you can do it.

27:38.115 --> 27:39.407
Out of the question!

27:39.408 --> 27:42.160
Just... a little flirt.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.786
Murray, no!

27:43.787 --> 27:45.872
- I'm not talkin' about intercourse.
- Intercourse?

27:45.873 --> 27:49.000
I said I am not talking
about intercourse.

27:49.001 --> 27:52.128
- I'm not a hooker, Murray.
- I know you're not a hooker!

27:52.129 --> 27:55.256
You're a beautiful, young woman.

27:55.257 --> 27:57.216
All I'm asking is if it's possible

27:57.217 --> 28:00.011
to adopt a flirtatious
attitude towards the doctor.

28:00.012 --> 28:03.639
No! He's happily engaged.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.308
Yeah, exactly!

28:05.309 --> 28:07.476
So what would be the point
of me flirtin' with him?

28:07.477 --> 28:09.437
Well, just his manhood, you know,

28:09.438 --> 28:11.731
just let him feel
desired and feel alive,

28:11.732 --> 28:14.192
make Tickle Head a great
place to be a man!

28:14.193 --> 28:16.566
And that's what you want?

28:16.820 --> 28:18.613
That's would make you happy, Murray,

28:18.614 --> 28:22.409
watching me come on to a stranger?

28:23.327 --> 28:25.453
Yes.

28:25.454 --> 28:27.163
No. The answer's no.

28:27.164 --> 28:29.707
And if you asked me,
I'd say no to the factory too.

28:30.334 --> 28:33.169
It's a petrochemical by-product
repurposing facility!

28:33.170 --> 28:35.338
- It's the oil company!
- It's recycling!

28:35.339 --> 28:37.173
That's good, eh? That's good, right?

28:37.174 --> 28:39.467
No! That's just something
they're doin' for public image,

28:39.468 --> 28:41.510
to repay for environmental
damage they done!

28:41.511 --> 28:45.097
- So let 'em pay!
- I don't want the oil company here!

28:45.098 --> 28:48.893
Well, you know, that's very easy
for you to say with a job, right?

28:48.894 --> 28:51.646
Government job with vacation pay.

28:51.647 --> 28:53.856
All I'm asking for
is a little flirt!

28:53.857 --> 28:55.608
Hey, Annette.

28:55.609 --> 28:57.936
You're cracked.

28:58.528 --> 29:01.731
- You're cracked!
- I know you're good for it.

29:20.175 --> 29:24.596
A cricket match is divided
into periods called innings.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.557
One team fields and the other bats.

29:28.475 --> 29:33.646
The two teams switch between fielding
and batting after each inning.

29:33.647 --> 29:35.815
All right, so we switch around.

29:35.857 --> 29:40.695
Now, all 11 members of the
fielding team take the field,

29:40.696 --> 29:43.781
but only two members
of the batting team

29:43.782 --> 29:46.492
are on the field at any given time.

29:46.493 --> 29:48.119
You stand side by side or what?

29:48.120 --> 29:49.912
Opposite ends of the field? Come on!

29:49.913 --> 29:52.748
- Does this make sense to any of you guys?
- You wanna do it?

29:52.749 --> 29:54.500
Give me a chance to look at it!

29:54.501 --> 29:58.421
Joe! Joe, we're sorry we took
your oars now, all right?

29:58.422 --> 30:00.089
- Give me the...
- Come on, that's enough!

30:00.090 --> 30:02.542
Now's not the time for questions.

30:06.104 --> 30:08.348
All right, go!

30:09.516 --> 30:11.058
Go!

30:11.059 --> 30:12.643
- That was awful!
- Awful! Bloody awful!

30:12.644 --> 30:13.894
Go!

30:13.895 --> 30:14.937
Right foot!

30:14.938 --> 30:17.064
Left foot! Right foot!

30:17.065 --> 30:19.258
That's your left foot, Henry.

30:19.459 --> 30:21.193
Go back.

30:21.194 --> 30:23.779
Right foot! Left foot!

30:23.780 --> 30:26.365
Right to the side! Follow through!

30:26.366 --> 30:29.068
There you go.
Back to where you were.

30:37.127 --> 30:38.729
Oh!

30:39.713 --> 30:41.339
Okay, Henry.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.594
Just swing it up!

30:47.395 --> 30:48.717
He's out!

30:55.187 --> 30:56.812
- You gotta run now.
- Yeah, you gotta run.

30:56.813 --> 30:58.272
He dropped it.

30:58.273 --> 31:01.726
- Run!
- You too, you gotta run.

31:02.652 --> 31:05.980
- Don't knock him over.
- Keep goin'. Where's the ball?

31:17.626 --> 31:19.418
Ta-da!

31:19.419 --> 31:23.130
- Oh, yes! Yeah.
- And this is for the top.

31:23.131 --> 31:24.673
Yeah, yeah.

31:24.674 --> 31:27.301
He looks the part.
You look good! Dapper!

31:27.302 --> 31:29.929
And I put some extra
protection down there for you.

31:29.930 --> 31:32.098
Yes, good. There.

31:32.099 --> 31:35.018
Why is it pink?

31:37.685 --> 31:39.730
Good luck, Murray!

31:42.067 --> 31:43.814
Come on!

31:44.403 --> 31:47.572
I took the wrong one!

31:56.039 --> 31:57.998
How's he doin'?

31:57.999 --> 32:00.451
Not good.

32:11.680 --> 32:13.632
You okay?

32:14.599 --> 32:16.391
All good.

32:16.893 --> 32:18.769
It's this fresh air. I just...

32:18.770 --> 32:23.357
I'm just used to, like, this
dense, dense smog, you know?

32:23.358 --> 32:25.860
That's why I never left the city.

32:25.861 --> 32:27.862
I get these anxiety attacks

32:27.863 --> 32:31.866
when I'm not mugged by a homeless
person on a daily basis, you know?

32:31.867 --> 32:34.114
Yeah.

32:35.704 --> 32:38.998
Yeah, those don't work here.
Land lines only.

32:38.999 --> 32:40.249
Sorry.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.168
Oh, that's... that's great.

32:59.519 --> 33:01.604
- They're coming!
- What?

33:01.605 --> 33:03.981
- They're comin'!
- Everybody up!

33:03.982 --> 33:05.733
Come on, everybody together!

33:05.734 --> 33:09.483
Come on now, get in your positions!
Let's play cricket!

33:29.257 --> 33:31.926
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

33:31.927 --> 33:35.804
What the... Is this for real?

33:35.805 --> 33:36.931
Hmm?

33:36.932 --> 33:39.305
This!

33:39.976 --> 33:44.188
- Do... do you like cricket?
- Love cricket.

33:44.189 --> 33:45.648
- I live for cricket.
- Really?

33:45.649 --> 33:48.817
- You play?
- Oh yeah. Oh, love that.

33:48.818 --> 33:51.153
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

33:51.154 --> 33:53.489
We got the final game
of the season here.

34:01.414 --> 34:03.286
Come on! Come on!

34:03.833 --> 34:05.543
No checking, no checking!

34:05.544 --> 34:07.169
Our fathers played.

34:07.170 --> 34:10.998
It's a great tradition
in our small harbour.

34:11.216 --> 34:14.927
That's definitely a... field
setting I've never seen before.

34:14.928 --> 34:18.054
Yeah, I know. I keep tellin'
them, but they don't listen.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.848
Final game, huh?

34:24.103 --> 34:26.605
- Let's go.
- Ah...

34:26.606 --> 34:27.940
- Oh, we gotta go!
- Not possible.

34:27.940 --> 34:29.358
A few overs never hurt no one.

34:29.359 --> 34:31.860
Nah, they hate spectators.

34:31.860 --> 34:34.154
No, we have to, Murray.

34:34.155 --> 34:35.906
Let's go.

34:35.907 --> 34:39.076
A few overs, for me.

34:39.661 --> 34:43.205
- Okay.
- Thank you.

34:45.583 --> 34:48.418
- He wants to watch the match.
- What?

34:48.420 --> 34:51.255
Well, that's it then.
The arse has gone out of her.

34:51.255 --> 34:54.132
No, no. Sound the horn.
I'll think of something.

34:57.470 --> 35:00.139
Come on now, get it
together, for God's sake!

35:00.140 --> 35:01.640
- They're coming.
- What?

35:01.641 --> 35:03.183
They're coming!

35:03.184 --> 35:05.936
They're... they're coming!
They're coming!

35:05.937 --> 35:07.763
Sweet Christ.

35:08.189 --> 35:10.566
Any idea what happens
after we hit the ball?

35:10.567 --> 35:12.192
- No.
- Is there a plan B

35:12.193 --> 35:13.235
you haven't told us about?

35:13.236 --> 35:15.028
No plan B.

35:15.363 --> 35:17.615
The doctor might find it peculiar that
we're dressed up as cricket players,

35:17.616 --> 35:19.658
that we're playing with equipment
that looks like cricket equipment,

35:19.659 --> 35:22.953
but we have absolutely no
idea how to play cricket!

35:25.832 --> 35:27.791
Keep playing!

35:31.838 --> 35:35.462
It's all right. It's all right.

35:37.344 --> 35:39.136
Jumpin' Jesus!

35:39.137 --> 35:41.055
What do we do? What do we do?

35:41.056 --> 35:42.723
I thought you'd all love hockey!

35:42.724 --> 35:45.017
What do we do? What do we do?

35:45.018 --> 35:47.269
We can't stand hockey.

35:47.270 --> 35:49.438
What do we do? What do we do?

35:49.439 --> 35:52.608
What do we do? What do we do? Simon!

35:52.651 --> 35:54.352
What do we do?

35:56.946 --> 35:59.198
Yay!

35:59.199 --> 36:01.742
- Huh?
- Yay!

36:11.461 --> 36:13.921
Oh, there you go. Game's over.

36:13.922 --> 36:16.795
Season's over.
Let's get back to the boat.

36:24.057 --> 36:25.891
Both teams won?

36:25.892 --> 36:28.477
Well, one team won the league,
one team won the match.

36:28.478 --> 36:31.397
You know, it's, uh...
it's basic good sportsmanship.

36:31.398 --> 36:32.648
Oh.

36:34.484 --> 36:36.276
Oh!

36:36.277 --> 36:38.112
Not too close, son.

36:38.113 --> 36:40.823
Sorry. Ah!

36:45.412 --> 36:48.497
- Ah, thank you.
- Yeah!

36:48.498 --> 36:52.828
It's a small harbour, but...
it's got a big heart.

36:53.878 --> 36:58.173
- Come on, they'll deliver the rest.
- Yeah. Thank you.

36:58.883 --> 37:01.881
They'll deliver that up.
That's all right. Come on.

37:11.896 --> 37:13.939
That's the pride of Tickle Head.

37:13.940 --> 37:15.732
- We can't touch her.
- Hmm...

37:39.966 --> 37:43.635
Here we are. Door's open.

37:43.636 --> 37:46.430
- The stuff will be up in a minute.
- All right.

37:46.431 --> 37:48.883
Well, thank you.

37:50.685 --> 37:52.728
Will you be needing any cocaine?

37:52.729 --> 37:55.898
I'm... I'm sorry, what?

37:55.899 --> 37:58.397
We're down with it.

37:59.235 --> 38:01.778
Yeah, it's...

38:01.863 --> 38:04.823
it's not really, uh... okay!

38:04.824 --> 38:07.322
But thanks.

38:08.578 --> 38:11.747
Enjoy our beautiful harbour.

38:39.901 --> 38:41.527
Oh, whoa!

39:15.436 --> 39:17.729
I can hear something.

39:18.147 --> 39:21.608
- I can definitely hear something.
- He's dialling.

39:21.609 --> 39:25.813
- He is!
- Turn it up. Put it on speakers.

39:28.324 --> 39:29.324
Ah!

39:29.325 --> 39:31.910
Jesus! Helen?

39:31.911 --> 39:33.787
- Hello?
- Helen!

39:33.788 --> 39:35.497
Don't touch that knob!

39:36.875 --> 39:38.827
- Henry!
- Okay, okay!

39:38.960 --> 39:41.545
- No, no, no!
- There.

39:41.546 --> 39:43.964
- Helen, can you hear me?
- Hello?

39:43.965 --> 39:47.342
- Hey, it's Paul. Helen...
- Paul! Oh, you wouldn't believe

39:47.343 --> 39:50.304
the number of upset clients of yours
that I had to deal with today.

39:50.305 --> 39:52.598
- It works!
- Mrs. Goldwater yelled at me

39:52.599 --> 39:55.350
'cause she won't get her new breasts
in time for her daughter's wedding.

39:55.351 --> 39:58.061
Uh, yeah, so have you
walked the dog lately?

39:58.062 --> 40:00.022
- Yes.
- 'Cause you gotta walk him

40:00.023 --> 40:03.191
at least two, three times a day,
every day. I'm talking every day.

40:03.192 --> 40:06.904
- You can talk to him too.
- No, I'm not gonna talk to him.

40:06.905 --> 40:09.239
He'll get depressed, Helen. He will.

40:09.240 --> 40:12.492
- You gotta talk to him. He's a good listener.
- He's a dog. I don't talk to dogs.

40:12.493 --> 40:14.369
Oh, and the dog park!

40:14.370 --> 40:17.164
Don't go back to that one we
always go to. That Yorkie's back.

40:17.165 --> 40:20.292
He gets in his head and he makes him
unmanly and he overcompensates

40:20.293 --> 40:22.210
for a week or two.
We don't want that.

40:22.211 --> 40:24.338
Do we have to write
down all this stuff?

40:24.339 --> 40:26.423
Yes!

40:26.424 --> 40:30.469
- So how is it, the town you're in?
- The town I'm in...

40:30.803 --> 40:35.133
Hmm... Medical opinion? Inbreeding.

40:36.643 --> 40:40.938
- I'm not... I'm not writin' that down.
- And what about the house?

40:40.939 --> 40:44.174
The house? Yeah, it's, uh...

40:44.175 --> 40:46.193
It's hideous.

40:46.194 --> 40:48.362
- Hideous? Oh!
- Oh, oh, oh!

40:48.363 --> 40:50.030
Didn't hear that, Henry.

40:50.031 --> 40:52.974
Didn't quite get what the
doctor said about your house.

40:52.992 --> 40:57.079
I gotta go. I'm late.
It's girls' night out.

40:57.080 --> 40:59.623
That reminds me, I talked
to Bernie before I left.

40:59.624 --> 41:01.708
Yeah, he's not gay, so he says.

41:01.709 --> 41:03.543
Bernie's gay? Bernie's gay!

41:03.544 --> 41:05.587
...a ploy to get women
in the sack. It works.

41:05.588 --> 41:07.422
It makes them feel
special, according to him.

41:07.423 --> 41:09.174
I may have to try that.

41:09.175 --> 41:10.384
Oh, for God's sake!

41:10.385 --> 41:11.718
Where you going?

41:11.719 --> 41:13.929
We're going to dinner, at the Taj!

41:13.930 --> 41:17.182
- "Taj".
- Ah! The Taj!

41:17.183 --> 41:19.101
I'd kill for that Lamb
Dhansak right now.

41:19.102 --> 41:21.728
- You get it spicy or mild?
- He'd kill for what?

41:21.729 --> 41:23.689
"Lamb dan" something!

41:23.690 --> 41:26.775
Taj, Taj. Taj Mahal.
That's, uh, curry.

41:26.776 --> 41:30.153
- Curry!
- Lamb Dhansak...

41:30.154 --> 41:33.073
...a little white wine...

42:22.415 --> 42:24.332
Hello.

42:24.417 --> 42:26.164
Hi.

42:26.794 --> 42:30.964
I'm Paul, the, uh, new doctor.

42:30.965 --> 42:33.167
Terrific.

42:37.430 --> 42:40.182
Uh, you know where
the, uh, restaurant is?

42:40.183 --> 42:44.478
It's over the hill, down by the pier.
You walked past it.

42:44.479 --> 42:46.938
Right. Right.

42:46.939 --> 42:50.688
I mean, what kind of moron would get
lost in a tiny village like this, huh?

42:50.943 --> 42:53.316
Pretty big moron, I guess.

42:54.030 --> 42:55.530
Mm-hmm.

42:55.531 --> 42:58.609
It's a harbour, not a village.

43:00.286 --> 43:02.613
Harbour. Mental noting.

43:05.124 --> 43:07.201
Right.

43:14.092 --> 43:15.967
- Good evening.
- Hello.

43:15.968 --> 43:18.386
- The soup today is carrot.
- Hmm!

43:18.387 --> 43:21.848
And the specials are flat fish,
hot turkey sandwich

43:21.849 --> 43:24.517
and Lamb Dhansak.

43:25.877 --> 43:27.504
Lamb Dhansak?

43:27.505 --> 43:31.025
Yes, it's our famous
Lamb Dhansak Festival.

43:36.572 --> 43:37.781
I'll take that.

43:37.782 --> 43:40.576
Okay then! One Lamb Dhansak.

43:57.051 --> 43:59.511
Hi.

43:59.512 --> 44:02.465
So, uh, I've been drinking.

44:03.015 --> 44:04.975
That's exactly what a
girl wants to hear

44:04.976 --> 44:07.644
when a stranger knocks on her
door in the middle of the night.

44:07.645 --> 44:10.897
Well, I asked where you lived.

44:10.898 --> 44:15.026
So, I just... I just
wanted to apologize.

44:15.027 --> 44:17.070
At ten o'clock?

44:17.071 --> 44:22.402
What, is there some kind of
curfew here for apologies?

46:09.433 --> 46:12.386
Are you open for business today?

46:12.645 --> 46:14.020
Yeah.

46:14.021 --> 46:16.314
Just, um...

46:16.315 --> 46:18.066
I'm just gonna need a minute.

46:18.067 --> 46:21.691
- Okay.
- Okay.

46:48.764 --> 46:51.216
Dr. Lewis.

46:51.767 --> 46:55.603
- Herbert.
- Dr. Lewis. Come on in.

46:55.604 --> 46:58.432
Dr. Lewis. Come on in.

46:58.441 --> 46:59.816
Have a seat.

46:59.817 --> 47:03.111
Breathe in and out.

47:03.112 --> 47:05.739
Nice, big, wide,
and give me a long "ah"...

47:05.740 --> 47:07.612
Ah...

47:07.908 --> 47:10.744
In and out.

47:10.745 --> 47:12.287
Ah...

47:12.288 --> 47:14.160
There you go.

47:14.957 --> 47:16.499
- Ah! Any swelling?
- Ooh!

47:16.500 --> 47:18.122
Okay.

47:21.297 --> 47:24.299
That's pretty good, huh? Right?

47:24.300 --> 47:26.172
That's pretty good.

47:26.260 --> 47:30.089
We're gonna put a bandage on there,
and then you will be on your way.

47:30.264 --> 47:34.764
Okay, if you wanna lay down
here, head here, please,

47:35.144 --> 47:37.145
and we'll take a peek.

47:37.146 --> 47:39.439
- Okay, any pain when I push down?
- No.

47:39.440 --> 47:41.191
- And when I release?
- No.

47:41.192 --> 47:43.860
All right, Calvert, you mind
if I take a peek at that?

47:43.861 --> 47:46.108
- Yeah.
- Great.

47:47.031 --> 47:49.949
Who put this on, if I may ask you?

47:49.950 --> 47:52.448
I put that on myself.

47:52.745 --> 47:55.914
Hmm... Okay.

47:56.040 --> 48:01.669
Well, uh, I got what you could
call persistent athlete's foot.

48:01.670 --> 48:03.380
- Okay.
- It's itchy.

48:03.381 --> 48:05.673
- Itchy, itchy all the time.
- Okay.

48:05.674 --> 48:07.296
And it's moving up!

48:07.385 --> 48:08.927
It's no longer athlete's
foot, it's athlete's leg.

48:08.928 --> 48:13.724
And I'm scared it'll go even higher.

48:14.392 --> 48:16.469
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you wanna see?

48:18.312 --> 48:20.772
Sure.

48:22.066 --> 48:25.110
Oh, yeah. That's, um...

48:25.778 --> 48:27.479
Mm-hmm.

48:28.239 --> 48:32.700
If the pain's still there, just come
back and see me in two weeks.

48:32.701 --> 48:34.702
- Uh, Lisa got the plantar warts.
- Don't!

48:34.703 --> 48:37.831
Keith fell down, scraped
up his leg Wednesday,

48:37.832 --> 48:40.083
James, Sherry and Krista all got
the ear infection last month,

48:40.084 --> 48:41.960
and little Kenny here
coughs at night.

48:41.961 --> 48:44.712
I mean I don't know, maybe it's
asthma or maybe it's allergies.

48:44.713 --> 48:46.506
- And David still wets his bed.
- Mom!

48:46.507 --> 48:48.425
Well, he's a doctor!

48:48.426 --> 48:50.760
I mean, I tried
everything, you know?

48:50.761 --> 48:55.432
Threats, treats. Nothing works.
He is a bed wetter!

48:57.143 --> 48:59.041
Anything else?

48:59.895 --> 49:02.689
I need to go on the pill.

49:04.275 --> 49:06.734
So, officially, you're not
coming this Tuesday?

49:06.735 --> 49:09.946
- You know how it is with work.
- Look, I'm not gonna last a full month here

49:09.947 --> 49:11.698
- without seeing you.
- I know.

49:11.699 --> 49:14.117
You know, it's beyond hectic.

49:14.118 --> 49:15.702
Uh, I'll call you right back.

49:15.703 --> 49:17.745
- Okay, bye!
- Yep. Okay, bye.

49:17.746 --> 49:19.330
- Hey, pal.
- Hey!

49:19.331 --> 49:22.750
- How was your first day?
- Busy! Yeah.

49:22.751 --> 49:24.878
Real busy, Murray.

49:24.879 --> 49:28.378
And at this rate,
I doubt I'll last a week.

49:41.270 --> 49:44.519
Are you all completely mad?

49:45.232 --> 49:49.357
The doctor said he saw
43 patients in one day!

49:50.154 --> 49:52.071
He said he witnessed things
he'd never seen before

49:52.072 --> 49:54.866
in his entire medical career.

49:55.284 --> 49:57.702
He said, and I quote,

49:57.703 --> 50:03.041
"I felt like I'd been transported
back to medieval times."

50:03.042 --> 50:06.127
Is this how we seduce
our good doctor?

50:06.128 --> 50:10.173
Who here has a case of
creeping athlete's foot?

50:11.509 --> 50:13.335
Who?

50:13.844 --> 50:15.220
Frank?

50:15.221 --> 50:17.468
Frank?

50:18.682 --> 50:21.059
Frank, you said to yourself,

50:21.060 --> 50:23.603
"The best way to convince
the doctor to live here

50:23.604 --> 50:26.523
"is to show him that there
exists here in Tickle Head

50:26.524 --> 50:29.192
"some kind of powerful foot fungus"?

50:29.401 --> 50:33.731
Well, it is very uncomfortable.

50:38.410 --> 50:41.746
From now on, I'll take the
doctor's appointments.

50:41.747 --> 50:44.324
All right, Annette...

50:44.625 --> 50:45.959
- Who's next?
- Over here...

50:47.960 --> 50:49.630
Aw, jeez!

50:50.923 --> 50:52.924
- Frank?
- I know, I know, no more athlete's foot.

50:52.925 --> 50:55.468
No, no, no. You like music, right?

50:55.469 --> 50:58.972
- Yeah.
- Yeah, great, 'cause the doctor loves jazz.

50:58.973 --> 51:00.848
Oh, man, I hate jazz.

51:00.849 --> 51:02.976
- Yeah? So, I'm busy.
- Right.

51:02.977 --> 51:04.602
- I gotta be somewhere.
- Yeah.

51:04.603 --> 51:06.854
So I'm really counting
on you, Frank. Thanks.

51:06.855 --> 51:10.066
No, no, no... I hate jazz!

51:10.067 --> 51:12.068
I hate jazz! Ah!

51:15.781 --> 51:17.698
Good morning.

51:19.326 --> 51:21.619
Come on in.

51:31.565 --> 51:34.299
- Hello?
- Mr. Anderson?

51:34.300 --> 51:37.427
- This is Murray French, from Tickle Head.
- Who?

51:37.428 --> 51:38.970
Murray French.

51:38.971 --> 51:41.180
The new mayor of Tickle Head.

51:41.181 --> 51:44.183
We're bidding for the repurposing
facility you guys are...

51:44.184 --> 51:46.185
Oh yes, yes, yes! Yes, Mr. French.

51:46.186 --> 51:48.354
I remember your town's proposal now.

51:48.355 --> 51:52.400
Well, I'm just calling to tell you that
we've got a doctor assigned full-time.

51:52.401 --> 51:54.485
Great news.
I'll make a note of that.

51:54.486 --> 51:56.988
But to be perfectly honest with
you, the town of Port Anne

51:56.989 --> 51:59.198
has made a dazzling bid.

51:59.199 --> 52:01.492
Well, we can beat
anything they offer.

52:01.493 --> 52:03.202
Anything.

52:03.203 --> 52:05.204
Yeah, no, they've been very creative

52:05.205 --> 52:09.917
- in coming up with an idea...
- Well, now, we can be creative.

52:09.918 --> 52:12.712
Believe me, Trip,
we can be creative.

52:13.881 --> 52:16.754
Sir, they've actually included
a personal assurance...

52:19.386 --> 52:21.804
How much is their
personal assurance?

52:21.805 --> 52:24.307
A bribe! He wants a bribe?

52:24.308 --> 52:26.517
- That's how these things work!
- Yeah, $100,000?

52:26.518 --> 52:29.186
It's nothing to what the
factory will generate!

52:29.772 --> 52:32.440
I can't get you that kind
of money, all right?

52:32.441 --> 52:34.859
Here.

52:35.653 --> 52:37.605
It's just a loan!

52:37.780 --> 52:41.407
Murray, there's no way that my boss
is gonna give me that kind of money.

52:41.408 --> 52:44.611
Your boss? Why don't
you make a decision?

52:44.912 --> 52:47.163
I'm this close to being
replaced with an ATM.

52:47.164 --> 52:49.741
You're already an ATM!

52:50.125 --> 52:51.918
I told you, we had to
do this the proper way.

52:51.919 --> 52:55.873
You could've worn a tie!
They watch these videos!

52:57.675 --> 53:00.127
What can I do for you
today, gentlemen?

53:00.344 --> 53:02.595
Henry, you know why we're here!

53:02.596 --> 53:04.931
A loan? I see!

53:11.021 --> 53:13.314
Names?

53:14.733 --> 53:16.984
I'm gonna punch you in the throat.

53:16.985 --> 53:20.655
Easy, Simon. Easy.

53:27.496 --> 53:28.955
Names?

53:28.956 --> 53:31.829
Same as yesterday.

53:44.888 --> 53:49.726
<i>I've come my dear
for to take my leave</i>

53:49.727 --> 53:53.604
<i>I'm going to sail love
Do not weep</i>

53:53.605 --> 53:58.693
<i>Going to sail o'er
the Spanish shore</i>

53:58.694 --> 54:01.738
<i>And I'll leave my fair one</i>

54:01.739 --> 54:05.491
<i>I'll leave my fair one</i>

54:05.492 --> 54:07.994
<i>Leave my fair one</i>

54:07.995 --> 54:12.199
<i>The girl I adore</i>

54:13.083 --> 54:17.712
<i>No cold no danger need I fear</i>

54:17.713 --> 54:22.384
<i>I'm going to sail in a privateer</i>

54:22.426 --> 54:27.472
<i>And if God pleases
to spare my life</i>

54:27.473 --> 54:35.980
<i>When I return love</i>

54:35.981 --> 54:40.936
<i>I'll make you my wife</i>

54:41.820 --> 54:46.073
<i>There's one thing more
that disturbs my mind</i>

54:46.074 --> 54:51.287
<i>When you're rambling
on the Spanish shore</i>

54:51.288 --> 54:55.082
<i>Oh you ne'er will think on...</i>

54:55.083 --> 54:57.126
Barb?

54:58.170 --> 55:03.417
Murray? What are you
doing? Oh, my God!

55:33.789 --> 55:37.166
He never liked that spaghetti.
It gave him the vicious heartburn.

55:37.167 --> 55:39.627
He still misses that dog.

55:39.628 --> 55:43.172
It's a spaniel. Bucket is
his name. Cute name.

55:43.173 --> 55:47.343
Maybe... maybe we should get
him a pet or something.

55:48.262 --> 55:51.465
- What's that?
- What?

55:51.682 --> 55:53.383
The page.

55:54.742 --> 55:56.469
Doodles.

55:56.728 --> 55:58.221
Show me.

55:58.522 --> 56:02.146
- No.
- Come on.

56:02.234 --> 56:05.687
It's private information.

56:07.072 --> 56:08.698
It could hurt him.

56:08.699 --> 56:12.076
Vera, we won't hurt him.

56:12.077 --> 56:14.279
I promise.

56:15.330 --> 56:18.453
He never had a father.

56:23.881 --> 56:25.840
Hmm...

56:29.386 --> 56:31.220
Ah, this is great!

56:31.221 --> 56:32.763
It's really nice.

56:32.764 --> 56:34.223
Fantastic.

56:37.227 --> 56:40.430
So, what's happenin'
with, uh, Kathleen?

56:41.064 --> 56:42.523
Postmistress Kathleen?

56:42.524 --> 56:45.647
Ah, you two are the
talk of the harbour.

56:46.862 --> 56:50.197
I mean, that's flattering, Murray,
and she is drop-dead gorgeous.

56:50.198 --> 56:52.074
I mean...

56:52.075 --> 56:56.454
But I can assure you that there is
nothing going on with her and I.

56:56.455 --> 56:57.705
I mean nothing.

57:01.043 --> 57:04.713
So what about the cocaine addiction?

57:05.130 --> 57:09.342
My... I... It's not a...

57:09.343 --> 57:11.594
It's... it's under control.

57:11.595 --> 57:13.467
You sure?

57:13.597 --> 57:16.682
Well, then you should bloody
well stop messing about with it.

57:16.683 --> 57:18.559
- Absolutely.
- It'll ruin your life.

57:18.560 --> 57:19.810
Ruin it!

57:19.811 --> 57:21.604
- It really is...
- Your life.

57:21.605 --> 57:23.022
You're right.

57:23.023 --> 57:25.100
Ruin it!

57:30.781 --> 57:35.076
Ah, she... she talks
about you all the time.

57:36.161 --> 57:40.866
You know, I feel I'm pretty
good at picking up signals,

57:41.166 --> 57:43.334
but... but from her, it's just...

57:43.377 --> 57:44.752
I mean, it is distant.

57:44.753 --> 57:48.214
I'm talking... I'm talking distant.

57:48.215 --> 57:51.509
Well, you know, since
you're engaged,

57:51.510 --> 57:56.847
she maybe prefers to keep her distance
a little bit, but she is in love.

57:56.848 --> 57:59.976
What? Murray, she's in... with me?

57:59.977 --> 58:02.304
Well, that's what she said.

58:02.604 --> 58:04.897
- Something about your smile, or...
- What?

58:04.898 --> 58:07.191
There you go. That's the one.

58:07.192 --> 58:08.893
No. No.

58:09.069 --> 58:11.737
That's it, that's the smile
right there. It drives her wild.

58:12.406 --> 58:17.111
I will catch one, I promise
you that, before I leave.

58:17.411 --> 58:20.284
Patience, son.
You'll get the hang of it.

58:21.665 --> 58:24.208
He stinks.

58:38.974 --> 58:41.221
So, I haven't been drinking.

58:41.810 --> 58:43.644
- That's a step in the right direction.
- Mm-hmm.

58:43.645 --> 58:45.688
Right? And I was wondering,

58:45.689 --> 58:47.815
do you know of a postmistress

58:47.816 --> 58:51.569
that would be interested in
sharing some crackers and cheese

58:51.570 --> 58:56.446
and a not-so-good
bottle of red wine?

58:58.160 --> 59:00.453
I'll keep an eye out.

59:00.495 --> 59:02.993
Hmm!

59:07.919 --> 59:10.667
You, sir, are in good health.

59:11.256 --> 59:13.299
What happened there?

59:13.800 --> 59:17.344
It was the substitute.

59:17.637 --> 59:19.463
The substitute?

59:20.140 --> 59:22.808
We're not allowed to say.

59:23.602 --> 59:25.978
- We're not allowed to say.
- Okay.

59:30.609 --> 59:33.059
- Did he ask?
- Yes!

59:33.360 --> 59:35.483
That a boy!

59:36.156 --> 59:39.909
Two weeks rolled by and our
plan was working perfect.

59:39.910 --> 59:43.830
You said you were coming in 10 days.
Do you know when you're coming, then?

59:43.872 --> 59:44.997
Are you coming at all?

59:46.041 --> 59:47.708
Side to side?

59:48.085 --> 59:50.787
Paul's heart was being tugged
at in all the right places.

59:52.547 --> 59:56.217
All hands were pitching in,
doing their part.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:02.264
Great...

01:00:02.641 --> 01:00:03.766
Our days were once again
filled with purpose.

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:08.104
That's a pretty good scar
there on your left shoulder.

01:00:08.105 --> 01:00:09.438
Uh-huh.

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:12.191
Let me guess, the substitute?

01:00:12.192 --> 01:00:13.984
Uh-huh...

01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:15.861
We'd all come together,

01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:18.940
working day and night
for a common dream.

01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:25.996
- I'm gonna go real loud.
- Okay.

01:00:25.997 --> 01:00:28.324
- Are you ready?
- Uh-huh.

01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:30.918
There's the solo.

01:00:30.919 --> 01:00:32.169
Now!

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:36.340
Ah! So good!

01:00:46.101 --> 01:00:51.105
But in spite of our efforts,
the doctor started to feel lonely.

01:00:51.106 --> 01:00:54.608
I know we talk every day,
but it's not the same.

01:00:54.609 --> 01:00:56.819
It's not the same. You're not
here, you're not beside me,

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:59.989
and I miss that.

01:01:00.365 --> 01:01:03.159
- And I miss you.
- Well, tell me,

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:06.363
what you would you
do if you were here?

01:01:07.122 --> 01:01:10.875
- Tell me.
- Uh, what would I do?

01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:12.334
Yeah, tell me, what would you do?

01:01:14.796 --> 01:01:18.299
- Tell me, naughty boy.
- Naughty boy?

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:24.510
Um, well...

01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:29.059
I would start by kissing your neck.

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:32.021
- Oh, would you?
- Yeah, I would.

01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:37.526
And then I would proceed
to caress your arms

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:39.361
and your back

01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:43.490
and those very, very,
very long legs.

01:01:43.491 --> 01:01:46.660
It's getting very hot in here.

01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:49.997
- Well, maybe you should undress.
- I already am.

01:01:49.998 --> 01:01:51.248
Nice.

01:01:51.249 --> 01:01:52.833
I need a cigarette.

01:01:52.834 --> 01:01:54.627
You quit.

01:01:54.628 --> 01:01:58.464
All right, I'm not gonna
smoke it, I'll just... suck on it.

01:02:00.091 --> 01:02:02.343
Tell me, what now, Dr. Lewis?

01:02:02.344 --> 01:02:04.011
I would, uh...

01:02:04.012 --> 01:02:06.805
Tell me. Tell me.

01:02:06.806 --> 01:02:09.350
- I would, uh...
- Tell me.

01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:11.560
I would, um...

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:13.729
For the love of God, tell her!

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:16.065
I'd play with my machine.

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:19.276
Mm... And then where
are you gonna put it?

01:02:19.277 --> 01:02:21.528
- What did he say?
- What will you do with your machine?

01:02:21.529 --> 01:02:23.280
I think he said machine.

01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:26.408
- Tell me...
- He's going to use his machine.

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:28.827
- What the hell is a machine?
- And then...

01:02:28.828 --> 01:02:34.375
I would caress, uh, your feet..

01:02:34.542 --> 01:02:36.543
With that gassed-up machine.

01:02:36.544 --> 01:02:39.479
Why would he do that?

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:41.840
Do we write all this down?

01:02:41.841 --> 01:02:44.385
Yes! Of course we have
to write this down!

01:02:44.386 --> 01:02:49.847
And then I'd flip it over and
clean out the undercarriage.

01:02:49.848 --> 01:02:52.434
I think I should draw some of this.

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:54.011
Yeah...

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:57.231
And then I'd see if it
wants to run on its own.

01:03:01.152 --> 01:03:02.987
With her feet?

01:03:02.988 --> 01:03:05.782
That's what I heard.

01:03:08.118 --> 01:03:13.956
He said he wanted to rub his big
machine up against her feet.

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:18.207
His machine? What's a machine?

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.671
Like a...

01:03:20.672 --> 01:03:22.398
Ha! No!

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:24.466
Yeah, I'd do it once.

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:26.840
- With your feet?
- Yep!

01:03:26.845 --> 01:03:30.640
Pfft! I'd be worried about fungus.

01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:33.976
What? It can spread
at an alarmin' rate.

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:35.394
Here, look, I'll show ya.

01:03:35.395 --> 01:03:37.517
- It's creepin' up my leg.
- Come on!

01:03:40.165 --> 01:03:42.150
No, you can't borrow 'em.

01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:43.819
- I'm sorry. What?
- Vera.

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:45.237
- Murray.
- Did you get it?

01:03:45.238 --> 01:03:48.066
Oh, shit!

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:50.276
There wasn't room in the fridge.

01:03:50.869 --> 01:03:53.321
You froze it?

01:03:54.706 --> 01:03:58.034
- It's not entirely frozen.
- Get a move on!

01:04:05.717 --> 01:04:07.919
I'm a dead man.

01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:10.633
What age are you, Paul?

01:04:10.889 --> 01:04:13.591
29 now.

01:04:16.603 --> 01:04:18.645
Why?

01:04:18.646 --> 01:04:24.102
It's just my son would be
close to your age about now.

01:04:24.319 --> 01:04:27.488
- We lost him 10 years ago.
- Oh...

01:04:27.614 --> 01:04:29.691
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

01:04:29.824 --> 01:04:31.525
What was his name?

01:04:32.577 --> 01:04:34.324
Gerald.

01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:37.077
Gerald...

01:04:40.418 --> 01:04:42.169
I lost my father.

01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:44.546
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:47.174
I don't usually talk about it.
I don't know.

01:04:47.175 --> 01:04:49.548
I don't usually talk about my son.

01:04:49.761 --> 01:04:53.764
I guess this is the way it would feel
if he was around still, you know?

01:04:53.765 --> 01:04:56.809
He passed away when I was two.

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:09.113
Hmm! Bubbles.

01:05:09.114 --> 01:05:10.280
Eh?

01:05:10.281 --> 01:05:11.982
Yeah.

01:05:12.117 --> 01:05:14.637
- Bubbles. What's that mean?
- Oh, that's a big fish there!

01:05:15.078 --> 01:05:16.829
Oh, yeah!

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:18.872
- No, stay calm! Stay calm!
- Oh, it's biting, Murray!

01:05:18.873 --> 01:05:21.871
- Calm down.
- We can't lose this.

01:05:23.128 --> 01:05:25.671
Take it easy, now.
Calm down. We got it.

01:05:25.672 --> 01:05:27.297
- Okay, yeah, yeah. Calm down.
- Yeah!

01:05:27.298 --> 01:05:29.842
- He's biting. What do I do? Reel?
- Reel him in.

01:05:29.843 --> 01:05:32.136
- Yes, and pull.
- Oh my God!

01:05:32.137 --> 01:05:33.512
Calm! Reel 'er in there!

01:05:33.513 --> 01:05:34.888
Yeah!

01:05:34.889 --> 01:05:36.636
Yeah, he's a fighter!

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:42.684
- It's huge, Murray!
- Just reel 'er in there.

01:05:43.022 --> 01:05:45.065
Oh, yeah! Look at that!

01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:47.317
- Here he comes!
- Get it!

01:05:47.318 --> 01:05:48.985
There we go!

01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:51.655
Yeah! Get it! Get him!

01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:53.282
- Yeah!
- There ya go!

01:05:54.367 --> 01:05:55.451
Yes!

01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:57.703
- He's...
- Eh?

01:05:57.704 --> 01:05:59.913
- Cold.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:01.665
Like almost frozen, really.

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:04.376
Oh, yeah, he must have
come from the very bottom.

01:06:04.377 --> 01:06:07.671
Right down there!
Oh, that's a beauty you got.

01:06:07.839 --> 01:06:09.590
Oh, my hands are cold!

01:06:09.591 --> 01:06:11.800
Thank you! Really! First fish!

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:14.503
- You're a natural.
- There you go.

01:06:24.439 --> 01:06:26.440
- Right behind him.
- He banged it!

01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:28.233
Pow!

01:06:37.869 --> 01:06:40.242
There we go!

01:06:40.788 --> 01:06:43.456
- To the great fisherman!
- Ah!

01:07:03.895 --> 01:07:06.848
It's been refused.

01:07:08.107 --> 01:07:09.691
Why?

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:12.277
First of all, $100,000
is a lot of money.

01:07:12.278 --> 01:07:16.990
Secondly, our forms don't have little
boxes you can check for bribes.

01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:19.659
- It's not a bribe.
- It's a bribe.

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:24.831
Are you really the
manager of this bank?

01:07:25.832 --> 01:07:27.751
Because if you really are,

01:07:27.752 --> 01:07:31.080
you know, the position holds
many responsibilities.

01:07:31.798 --> 01:07:35.717
You know. I mean, obviously,
there's a lot of documents to stamp.

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:38.428
Don't! Don't! No! Don't!

01:07:38.429 --> 01:07:42.099
You probably have some complex
accounting you have to see to.

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:43.976
Stop! Don't! Murray!

01:07:43.977 --> 01:07:46.937
Don't! Stop it, Murray! Don't!

01:07:46.938 --> 01:07:50.399
- Stop it!
- Then I imagine you set aside

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:54.278
- 15 minutes preciously on the Internet...
- Stop it!

01:07:54.279 --> 01:07:57.114
...where you take time to
polish your cricket stick.

01:07:57.115 --> 01:07:59.199
Don't! They watch those videos!

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.909
Oh, yeah?

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:02.369
Don't! They watch those...

01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:04.492
- Murray!
- There's more.

01:08:04.497 --> 01:08:07.700
There's also a part of your job where
you have to believe in the project!

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:10.419
You have to be a
part of the project!

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.879
A bank manager gets
involved with the project,

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:15.424
he sticks his neck out,
he risks his reputation,

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:18.924
goes for broke, he rolls the bones!

01:08:19.804 --> 01:08:22.014
He looks the superior straight
in the eye and he says,

01:08:22.015 --> 01:08:26.515
"Forget the application form!
I know this project's gonna work!"

01:08:28.062 --> 01:08:31.273
A bank manager does
all those things!

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:34.651
If you can't do all these things,
Henry, I'm afraid you're...

01:08:34.652 --> 01:08:35.902
Don't say it, okay?

01:08:35.903 --> 01:08:38.571
Just don't say it.

01:08:38.698 --> 01:08:42.242
- Don't say it.
- If you can't do all these things, Henry,

01:08:42.493 --> 01:08:45.742
you are nothing but an ATM.

01:08:54.212 --> 01:08:55.921
Is there something I should sign?

01:09:08.728 --> 01:09:10.554
Oh!

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:36.042
Enjoying your stay?

01:09:39.384 --> 01:09:41.385
Yeah.

01:09:41.386 --> 01:09:45.263
I mean, it's, uh, a bit different.

01:09:45.264 --> 01:09:48.934
You know, I guess I'm used
to restaurants and theatres

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:51.645
and cellphone coverage,

01:09:51.645 --> 01:09:54.981
to different cultures and
opportunities, you know?

01:09:54.982 --> 01:09:57.984
- But here, it's...
- In our little village...

01:09:57.985 --> 01:10:00.358
No, I didn't say that.

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:02.694
Small harbour.

01:10:02.907 --> 01:10:04.733
It's the people.

01:10:04.826 --> 01:10:07.536
You don't even have to ask how
they're doing, you just know.

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:10.410
And there's something
about that, that...

01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:14.960
You know? Especially if
those people let you in.

01:10:22.552 --> 01:10:24.549
- Hey, Paul.
- Hey.

01:10:25.513 --> 01:10:29.599
So, uh... so I had these
patients this morning,

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:33.729
- and they had these awful-looking scars.
- Yeah.

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:36.649
You know who the
substitute is, Murray?

01:10:40.027 --> 01:10:42.479
Can't say.

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:44.691
Please.

01:10:45.032 --> 01:10:47.951
The butcher! They received
care from the butcher.

01:10:47.952 --> 01:10:49.828
Since he's the butcher,
he has the most knowledge

01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:51.455
of the human anatomy.

01:10:51.456 --> 01:10:53.749
Apparently he read a
couple books in the '80s.

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:55.751
I mean, can you imagine?
I guarantee you

01:10:55.752 --> 01:10:57.586
he doesn't even scrub down.

01:10:57.587 --> 01:11:01.047
On the sanitary purpose,
it's... it's ridiculous!

01:11:01.048 --> 01:11:03.759
You should see the size of
these scars he leaves behind.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.635
How do they live like this?

01:11:05.636 --> 01:11:07.179
It's ridiculous!

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:09.848
Everyone deserves the
right to have a doctor!

01:11:09.849 --> 01:11:13.059
I mean, we have reached the
21st century, haven't we?

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:15.228
Oh, and get this. Get this.

01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:18.231
So, the mayor was telling me
about this man, Mr. Smith.

01:11:18.232 --> 01:11:21.443
He had a heart attack
in broad daylight,

01:11:21.444 --> 01:11:23.904
and people are just watching
because they have no one to call.

01:11:23.905 --> 01:11:27.449
So, Mr. Smith just dies because
they have no one to call.

01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:29.201
He dies. He dies!

01:11:29.202 --> 01:11:31.661
- Hmm...
- Who's Mr. Smith?

01:11:31.662 --> 01:11:34.247
- I mean...
- Just something that could've happened.

01:11:34.248 --> 01:11:36.583
...to have a doctor.

01:11:36.584 --> 01:11:39.127
- Don't you agree?
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:42.214
- Helen?
- Yeah.

01:11:42.215 --> 01:11:45.467
- Are you listening?
- Yeah, I'm listening.

01:11:45.468 --> 01:11:50.764
- It just seems like you're not listening.
- No, it's just... I'm late. I have to go.

01:11:50.765 --> 01:11:54.142
Well, I'm sorry to bother you
with the woes of a tiny harbour.

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:56.520
I'll call you. I love you.

01:11:56.521 --> 01:11:58.473
Love you, too.

01:12:02.443 --> 01:12:07.364
He adores her. How are you
gonna get her to come?

01:12:07.365 --> 01:12:09.032
- Yeah?
- Jack.

01:12:09.033 --> 01:12:10.700
- Hey!
- Hey. Paul.

01:12:10.868 --> 01:12:13.286
Hey, man. Gone crazy out
there yet? What's up?

01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:16.915
- That's his best friend.
- Hey, can you do me a favour

01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:18.917
and record Pakistan vs. England?

01:12:18.918 --> 01:12:21.795
And don't tell me the score this
time, it defeats the whole purpose.

01:12:21.796 --> 01:12:26.132
- Okay.
- And secondly, have you seen Helen lately?

01:12:26.133 --> 01:12:27.709
- No, why?
- I don't know.

01:12:27.844 --> 01:12:29.302
She's acting super
weird on the phone.

01:12:29.303 --> 01:12:31.346
Can you just... Can you
keep an eye on her?

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:33.974
Yeah, no problem.

01:12:35.476 --> 01:12:37.018
Okay, listen up.

01:12:43.109 --> 01:12:46.444
Mr. Anderson from the
oil company just called.

01:12:46.445 --> 01:12:48.988
We've got a problem.

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.783
150 labourers are needed
for this facility,

01:12:51.784 --> 01:12:54.536
and if we do not fill that quota,

01:12:54.537 --> 01:12:56.413
we will not get a factory.

01:12:56.414 --> 01:12:59.458
We can make it work if
everybody works together.

01:13:00.418 --> 01:13:02.995
So, here's the plan.

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:44.628
The government census says 125.

01:13:46.464 --> 01:13:48.840
There are people in
our little harbour

01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:52.670
who've been living under
the radar for years now,

01:13:52.762 --> 01:13:57.057
not paying taxes, see?
No cod, no work.

01:13:57.058 --> 01:13:59.184
Hmm.

01:13:59.185 --> 01:14:00.936
Come on, Billy!

01:14:00.937 --> 01:14:04.607
Hurry! Go!

01:14:05.483 --> 01:14:09.687
Okay, quick,
put it down there! Yeah!

01:14:14.325 --> 01:14:16.034
See? It's all there.

01:14:16.035 --> 01:14:18.036
And they haven't been
collecting welfare?

01:14:18.037 --> 01:14:20.288
Simple bureaucratic error.

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:24.584
There's a population of 221
people here, Mr. Anderson.

01:14:25.503 --> 01:14:29.631
Well, we're gonna need you to back
that up more extensively, Mr. French.

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:31.633
Well, who you gonna trust?

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:35.470
Some bean counter in Ottawa,
who's never even been here,

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:37.347
or the town mayor who knows better?

01:14:37.348 --> 01:14:40.597
I have counted every head.

01:14:41.352 --> 01:14:44.062
I can't just trust
you on this. Sorry.

01:14:44.063 --> 01:14:46.640
Okay, I have an idea.

01:14:46.941 --> 01:14:49.643
How many people do you
think are here right now?

01:14:52.071 --> 01:14:54.030
100, give or take.

01:14:54.031 --> 01:14:56.278
84, Trip.

01:14:58.285 --> 01:15:00.658
Follow me. I wanna
show you something.

01:15:00.913 --> 01:15:02.660
- What?
- Come on.

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:15.427
Okay! Okay, go!

01:15:15.428 --> 01:15:17.425
Go, go!

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:23.101
Hey. Hey!

01:15:23.102 --> 01:15:24.811
Where's everyone going?

01:15:24.812 --> 01:15:28.356
It's, uh, eight o'clock.

01:15:28.482 --> 01:15:32.444
Entertainment Tonight is on.
How about a drink?

01:15:32.445 --> 01:15:35.739
A lot of people now don't come
out of their houses too much.

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:39.410
Then, of course, there's a lot more
that'll move back once there's jobs.

01:15:39.452 --> 01:15:41.786
You got the elderly on
top of that, I guess.

01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:44.706
So, there's a lot of
people here, all right.

01:15:46.584 --> 01:15:48.786
Cheers.

01:15:52.465 --> 01:15:55.925
Oh, I'd say twice the population here
before the fishing was stopped.

01:15:55.926 --> 01:16:00.347
And, uh, yeah, they'll be
all back pretty quick.

01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:11.816
Right up this way.

01:16:12.276 --> 01:16:14.569
Where are we going, exactly?

01:16:17.323 --> 01:16:21.034
All right, I'm calling it.

01:16:21.035 --> 01:16:23.244
No, no, no! Stay, stay!

01:16:23.245 --> 01:16:24.871
Let's talk cricket!

01:16:24.872 --> 01:16:27.620
I love the game. I love it.

01:16:30.086 --> 01:16:32.459
Come on! Come on, come on.

01:16:40.513 --> 01:16:42.931
Hurry up!

01:16:43.724 --> 01:16:45.721
Sit down, sit down.

01:16:52.650 --> 01:16:55.193
- I 23!
- Bingo!

01:16:55.194 --> 01:16:57.195
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
ourselves a lucky winner.

01:16:57.196 --> 01:16:59.944
Can we get a caller down
there to check her out?

01:17:01.992 --> 01:17:06.079
- Good bingo!
- We do indeed have ourselves a bingo!

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:08.915
Next game is the letter T!
The letter T!

01:17:08.916 --> 01:17:13.336
- Oh, what did you pick?
- B 14! B 14!

01:17:13.337 --> 01:17:15.084
82, Trip.

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:18.967
Next game is for the
magic T! Magic T!

01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:20.218
There you go.

01:17:23.347 --> 01:17:26.057
Roll on, boy. Roll on.

01:17:26.058 --> 01:17:30.183
Boys, you go on ahead.
I'll see you at the chopper.

01:17:34.233 --> 01:17:39.063
So, how's the, uh, personal
assurance coming along?

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:43.825
Consider it done, Mr. Anderson.

01:17:43.909 --> 01:17:46.286
That's fantastic.
We'll be in touch, then.

01:17:46.287 --> 01:17:48.121
We will.

01:17:48.122 --> 01:17:52.577
Oh! Yeah, how do I get back
to that restaurant thingy?

01:17:53.252 --> 01:17:56.922
- The restaurant?
- Yeah, I forgot my hat.

01:17:57.631 --> 01:18:02.260
Um... down to the left
there, it'll take you down.

01:18:02.261 --> 01:18:04.759
- Huh?
- I'll meet you there.

01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:06.715
Okay.

01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:13.980
Back! Everybody back!

01:18:13.981 --> 01:18:16.604
He's headin' back to Joe's!
Change your clothes!

01:18:19.653 --> 01:18:24.032
The best wicket keeper. Who?

01:18:24.033 --> 01:18:27.076
One, two, three.

01:18:27.077 --> 01:18:29.324
- Adam Gilchrist!
- Adam Gilchrist!

01:18:29.872 --> 01:18:30.997
My God, it's like we're...

01:18:30.998 --> 01:18:32.824
- No way!
- Yeah!

01:18:45.679 --> 01:18:47.805
- You remember that one game in...
- Oh...

01:18:47.806 --> 01:18:50.224
- '06?
- '06!

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:10.324
Hi, there.

01:19:12.998 --> 01:19:15.325
I believe you have my hat.

01:19:15.876 --> 01:19:18.294
Oh! Uh, sorry.

01:19:18.295 --> 01:19:23.967
I was, uh... I was
just keepin' it warm.

01:19:24.218 --> 01:19:26.135
Can I have it back?

01:19:26.387 --> 01:19:28.213
Yeah, of course. Of course.

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:34.894
Where did everybody go?

01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:39.607
- Uh...
- It's after 8.

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:41.776
Entertainment Tonight's on.

01:19:42.403 --> 01:19:44.404
Ah!

01:19:44.405 --> 01:19:46.402
Yeah.

01:19:52.246 --> 01:19:56.576
He said "ah", and then he left.

01:19:57.084 --> 01:19:59.335
- He just left?
- Yeah!

01:19:59.336 --> 01:20:00.670
"Ah"?

01:20:03.549 --> 01:20:06.592
So, like, "Ah..."

01:20:06.593 --> 01:20:11.093
Or was it, "Ah, you bloody liars!"

01:20:12.683 --> 01:20:16.019
Murray, I'm sorry, I didn't pay
attention to the "ah", okay?

01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:19.894
I never drink! I'm not
used to drinking.

01:20:20.399 --> 01:20:22.817
I need a beer.

01:20:29.033 --> 01:20:32.282
...more character than we've
seen so far this morning.

01:20:32.578 --> 01:20:34.780
Now back to the
action in the middle.

01:20:35.122 --> 01:20:38.791
Poised right now.
They've been 225 for 5.

01:20:38.792 --> 01:20:41.462
Let's see what he gives us.

01:20:42.463 --> 01:20:44.964
Cook and Bell looking to
rebuild the inning somewhat.

01:20:44.965 --> 01:20:47.633
Hilfenhaus will be coming
in once more to Bell.

01:20:47.634 --> 01:20:48.885
A long run.

01:20:50.971 --> 01:20:52.806
Nice!

01:20:53.807 --> 01:20:57.018
He saw the gap square at the wicket
on the offside, there. Great vision.

01:20:57.019 --> 01:20:59.687
Exactly. He's good.

01:21:02.191 --> 01:21:03.733
- Leg before wicket.
- Aw!

01:21:03.734 --> 01:21:05.527
Leg before wicket!

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:08.071
Come on! Watch the replay!

01:21:08.072 --> 01:21:10.031
- Right here. Watch the replay!
- Do we need to?

01:21:10.032 --> 01:21:11.657
You're right, we don't.

01:21:11.658 --> 01:21:13.450
You're right.

01:21:13.494 --> 01:21:16.496
- It's not cricket, boys.
- That's not cricket at all.

01:21:16.497 --> 01:21:18.748
No.

01:21:18.749 --> 01:21:22.251
That's put England's stock lower
than they were a few minutes ago.

01:21:22.252 --> 01:21:24.962
See what he serves up here.
Big one coming up.

01:21:24.963 --> 01:21:27.840
- That's a glorious...
- Nice stroke!

01:21:28.841 --> 01:21:31.260
Nice! That's good! Cheers!

01:21:33.305 --> 01:21:36.682
Here we go! It is gone, gentlemen!

01:21:36.683 --> 01:21:39.060
I'm off to water the lily.
Keep an eye!

01:21:39.061 --> 01:21:43.015
It's heating up, guys!
It's heating up!

01:21:43.482 --> 01:21:45.691
If I was there, I'd take
one of them flat bats

01:21:45.692 --> 01:21:48.152
and I'd beat the crap out
of every last one of them.

01:21:48.153 --> 01:21:50.780
They have no right calling
this a sport. It's not a sport!

01:21:50.781 --> 01:21:53.991
No, it's like watching
baseball, only longer.

01:21:53.992 --> 01:21:58.538
Nothing makes sense. Joe! Joe, get the
score on the Habs game. Quick, quick!

01:21:58.539 --> 01:22:01.290
- Quick.
- ...to the point for Diaz!

01:22:01.291 --> 01:22:06.462
Sends it in the corner of the Jets' zone,
and the puck comes back to the point...

01:22:06.463 --> 01:22:10.258
Canadiens on the power play.
Ryder on the right side...

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:13.929
- Get it, get it, get it...
- Come on, come on...

01:22:14.304 --> 01:22:16.431
Fires, scores!

01:22:17.132 --> 01:22:18.575
No!

01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:26.850
All right!

01:22:29.278 --> 01:22:31.237
Quiet down. Quiet down!

01:22:31.238 --> 01:22:33.360
Change it back. Change it back.

01:22:33.907 --> 01:22:37.134
- What did I miss?
- Nothing, we're just fooling with ya.

01:22:38.745 --> 01:22:40.617
- No!
- Yeah!

01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:43.916
Seriously, what happened?
What did I miss?

01:22:43.917 --> 01:22:46.085
The, uh, thrower threw

01:22:46.086 --> 01:22:51.257
and then they hit and they scored
loads of points in a very...

01:22:51.258 --> 01:22:53.380
spectacular manner.

01:22:54.511 --> 01:22:59.599
'Cause they were running
and running and running,

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:01.350
and then... and then bam!

01:23:01.351 --> 01:23:05.104
The enemy cross-checked
the hell out of the runner,

01:23:05.105 --> 01:23:07.732
in a very spectacular manner.

01:23:07.733 --> 01:23:09.066
'Cause it was...

01:23:09.067 --> 01:23:10.943
I thought it was
surprising, you know?

01:23:10.944 --> 01:23:15.323
'Cause if you ask me, it was
definitely egg before wicket.

01:23:15.324 --> 01:23:16.574
Mm-hmm.

01:23:19.369 --> 01:23:23.039
- He does not look to be much of a happy...
- I get it.

01:23:24.708 --> 01:23:26.910
I get it.

01:23:33.091 --> 01:23:35.801
You're piss drunk again, aren't you?

01:23:35.802 --> 01:23:38.479
Yes! Yeah! I'm loaded!

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:42.429
- Yeah, I'm loaded. Don't mind me.
- Ignore him. We do!

01:23:42.809 --> 01:23:44.810
Right pissed!

01:23:44.811 --> 01:23:49.061
Hey, Joe, can I get a double rum
when you get a chance, please?

01:23:53.904 --> 01:23:55.279
Ah!

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:56.948
Eh?

01:23:58.449 --> 01:23:59.992
20 smackers right here!

01:23:59.993 --> 01:24:03.412
- You just find that?
- I just found it right there!

01:24:03.413 --> 01:24:05.373
- Every time!
- Whoa!

01:24:05.374 --> 01:24:08.000
- Yeah.
- Unbelievable.

01:24:08.001 --> 01:24:10.086
Smackers. Every time.

01:24:10.087 --> 01:24:13.085
Aw, man! That's amazing!

01:24:30.023 --> 01:24:32.149
Hi, you've reached Helen.
Leave me a message.

01:24:34.027 --> 01:24:35.278
Well...

01:24:38.824 --> 01:24:40.696
You're still not answering.

01:24:41.159 --> 01:24:44.658
Alas I am left only
with my thoughts.

01:24:45.789 --> 01:24:48.366
I had a dream last night.

01:24:48.667 --> 01:24:53.497
I dreamt of us living by the sea.

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:56.841
There was the afternoon barbeque,

01:24:56.842 --> 01:25:00.671
three little children
running around.

01:25:01.013 --> 01:25:03.932
I saw our future last night,

01:25:04.808 --> 01:25:06.930
and it was perfect.

01:25:07.728 --> 01:25:10.226
You'd love it here.

01:25:11.106 --> 01:25:13.683
Sweet dreams.

01:25:20.616 --> 01:25:23.743
We gotta sign him right away.
Right away!

01:25:23.744 --> 01:25:27.038
- Nah, it's too soon.
- Why too soon?

01:25:27.039 --> 01:25:29.537
Well, the hook is in.

01:25:30.125 --> 01:25:31.872
Now comes the hard part.

01:25:32.085 --> 01:25:35.379
Like me father used to say,
"Jiggin' the fish is easy.

01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:38.299
After that, you have
to pull him in."

01:25:40.927 --> 01:25:42.799
You have to convince the fish

01:25:42.846 --> 01:25:46.345
that the best place in the whole
wide world is in the boat.

01:25:46.725 --> 01:25:49.393
How the hell are we gonna do that?

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:59.069
Nope! Nothing!

01:26:00.170 --> 01:26:02.615
Looks it's gonna be a while.

01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:08.655
- You're stuck here, boy.
- My boss is gonna kill me!

01:26:09.206 --> 01:26:11.290
In the meantime,
why don't you just relax

01:26:11.291 --> 01:26:14.414
and spend some time
in our fine harbour?

01:26:15.712 --> 01:26:17.505
You got any clean clothes?

01:26:17.506 --> 01:26:19.503
No!

01:26:20.217 --> 01:26:22.385
I've got some.

01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:29.975
I think hunting is something you learn.
I think it's something you're...

01:26:33.730 --> 01:26:36.558
This boat was particularly...

01:26:37.234 --> 01:26:39.436
Joe!

01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:42.154
So, who's the new guy?

01:26:42.155 --> 01:26:44.782
Oh, uh, he's applying
to be our new doctor.

01:26:44.783 --> 01:26:48.577
Uh, we need one to get a
new repurposing plant.

01:26:48.578 --> 01:26:50.705
He wants to sign for five years.

01:26:50.706 --> 01:26:52.373
Oh, I hear he's great!

01:26:52.374 --> 01:26:54.751
What'd you say?

01:26:56.252 --> 01:26:57.795
You're hilarious!

01:26:59.381 --> 01:27:01.590
Sorry, another round for
the table, Joe, please.

01:27:01.591 --> 01:27:03.759
Paul, hi! Didn't see
you there! How are ya?

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:07.430
Listen, I forgot to say, uh...
you got a day off tomorrow.

01:27:07.431 --> 01:27:08.889
Dr. Morris is filling in.

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:11.100
- Sure, whatever you need.
- All right!

01:27:11.101 --> 01:27:13.769
- I'll maybe go fishing tomorrow!
- Sure, why not?

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:47.219
- Murray!
- Paul!

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:49.054
Ready for some big-time fishing?

01:27:49.055 --> 01:27:51.182
Uh, sorry, boss.

01:27:51.183 --> 01:27:54.977
I... I gotta stick around,
you know, help out Dr. Morris.

01:27:54.978 --> 01:27:56.270
Okay, doctor?

01:27:56.271 --> 01:27:58.598
Go ahead!

01:27:58.648 --> 01:27:59.690
Another time, then.

01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:02.644
Yeah! Sorry!

01:28:35.393 --> 01:28:37.720
Hi, Paul!

01:28:41.441 --> 01:28:44.189
When'll the boat be ready?

01:28:45.904 --> 01:28:47.947
Soon!

01:28:52.202 --> 01:28:55.538
I think we got the doctor.
I think we got him!

01:28:55.539 --> 01:28:59.124
- Oh, that's terrific, Murray!
- Yeah, you'll be coming back, Barb.

01:28:59.125 --> 01:29:01.502
That's great! I'm really glad.

01:29:01.503 --> 01:29:03.455
You'll be coming back?

01:29:03.755 --> 01:29:06.340
I love you Murray.
I really miss you.

01:29:06.341 --> 01:29:10.295
I know we talk on the
phone all the time, but...

01:29:11.054 --> 01:29:14.223
- it's not the same.
- No.

01:29:14.850 --> 01:29:18.435
You're not here.
You're not lying beside me.

01:29:18.436 --> 01:29:20.646
I miss you. I really,
really miss you.

01:29:20.647 --> 01:29:21.856
Yeah.

01:29:21.857 --> 01:29:24.150
If you were here, I'd...

01:29:24.609 --> 01:29:26.402
kiss your neck.

01:29:26.403 --> 01:29:28.696
- Murray...
- Yeah!

01:29:28.697 --> 01:29:31.365
And then I'd kiss a
little bit lower maybe.

01:29:33.076 --> 01:29:36.662
- Murray!
- You don't, uh, fancy

01:29:36.663 --> 01:29:40.833
just unfastening the button on
your blouse there a bit, do ya?

01:29:40.834 --> 01:29:42.793
Okay.

01:29:42.794 --> 01:29:45.754
Yeah, just a little bit.
I need to get in there.

01:29:47.799 --> 01:29:49.425
No, I'm always happy to
take your call, Henry,

01:29:49.426 --> 01:29:52.428
but he's made his
decision based on policy.

01:29:52.429 --> 01:29:56.473
But he rejected a very
solid loan application.

01:29:56.474 --> 01:29:59.476
Henry, I've reviewed
the file personally,

01:29:59.477 --> 01:30:01.599
out of respect for you.

01:30:01.688 --> 01:30:04.899
- Well, you live in Tickle Head.
- Well, that's just the thing, Mrs. Carter,

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:08.068
because it's a bit of a chicken
and the egg scenario right now,

01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:12.114
'cause the harbour is on the cusp
of a very lucrative contract.

01:30:12.115 --> 01:30:13.991
We don't deal in "justs".

01:30:13.992 --> 01:30:16.368
Our clients assume the risks,
not us. You know this.

01:30:16.369 --> 01:30:21.081
I've been an employee of this bank
for 18 years now, Mrs. Carter.

01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:24.001
Henry, your job is to cash
welfare cheques once a month.

01:30:24.002 --> 01:30:27.588
It's simple. I'm not trying to
minimize your years of loyalty.

01:30:27.589 --> 01:30:31.216
- You started under my own father, but...
- Don't say it. Don't say it.

01:30:31.217 --> 01:30:34.591
...we could replace you
with an automatic teller.

01:30:35.013 --> 01:30:37.260
She said it.

01:31:00.956 --> 01:31:02.539
What's this?

01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:06.418
That's our, uh, loan, for the bribe.

01:31:08.296 --> 01:31:12.967
And this, that's my
résumé for the factory.

01:31:15.679 --> 01:31:18.427
I'm gonna lose my job over this.

01:31:20.308 --> 01:31:25.479
That loan will cost us
$500 a month for 20 years.

01:31:27.607 --> 01:31:30.025
- Wow!
- Yeah.

01:31:31.987 --> 01:31:33.939
Thanks, Henry.

01:31:35.073 --> 01:31:36.899
Thanks.

01:31:46.876 --> 01:31:50.204
Murray! Murray!

01:31:50.797 --> 01:31:52.756
What? What?

01:31:52.757 --> 01:31:55.718
- After you dropped me off this morning...
- Paul left a message...

01:32:01.975 --> 01:32:03.559
One at a time!

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:05.436
- Okay, all right.
- You go ahead.

01:32:05.437 --> 01:32:07.229
Okay.

01:32:07.230 --> 01:32:09.815
Paul was calling Helen,
but she wasn't answering him,

01:32:09.816 --> 01:32:12.818
so he left her a long message. Long!

01:32:12.819 --> 01:32:15.571
Then he started talking
about her feet

01:32:15.572 --> 01:32:17.072
and oiling her machine!

01:32:17.073 --> 01:32:18.907
That is not important!

01:32:18.908 --> 01:32:21.660
I'm very troubled by
that machine stuff.

01:32:21.661 --> 01:32:23.620
Will you get to the point?

01:32:23.621 --> 01:32:25.456
Paul was calling everywhere.

01:32:25.457 --> 01:32:27.207
He phoned his friend Jack.

01:32:27.208 --> 01:32:28.375
His best friend!

01:32:28.376 --> 01:32:30.044
She was with him!

01:32:30.045 --> 01:32:32.546
Helen's been cheatin'
on him for three years!

01:32:32.547 --> 01:32:37.133
- With his best friend!
- It's over! It's over!

01:32:37.634 --> 01:32:39.632
He got no more ties.

01:32:41.222 --> 01:32:44.175
He has no ties.

01:32:59.074 --> 01:33:01.572
Well...

01:33:08.666 --> 01:33:10.250
Rough day?

01:33:14.798 --> 01:33:17.796
It's over with Helen.

01:33:19.427 --> 01:33:21.011
I'm sorry, Paul.

01:33:21.012 --> 01:33:22.304
Don't be.

01:33:23.723 --> 01:33:26.558
Everything in the past
three years is...

01:33:26.559 --> 01:33:28.685
She's only with my best friend.

01:33:28.686 --> 01:33:31.229
My best friend.

01:33:31.231 --> 01:33:34.150
I mean, it's only a best friend.

01:33:35.068 --> 01:33:39.404
But what I can't
comprehend is how...

01:33:41.324 --> 01:33:43.075
...is how I didn't realize

01:33:43.076 --> 01:33:46.996
that absolutely everything
around me was false.

01:33:49.374 --> 01:33:52.623
Everybody was telling me lies.

01:33:54.337 --> 01:33:56.710
Hmm!

01:33:56.881 --> 01:33:59.800
'Cause, I mean, my so-called
friends, they must have known.

01:33:59.801 --> 01:34:02.970
The two of them must've met when I
was behind the operating table,

01:34:02.971 --> 01:34:05.931
probably giving someone a new nose,

01:34:05.932 --> 01:34:07.641
maybe some new breasts,

01:34:07.642 --> 01:34:11.645
or those fake cheekbones that
everyone knows they're fake!

01:34:11.646 --> 01:34:15.316
Nobody has cheekbones like
that, Murray, nobody!

01:34:23.158 --> 01:34:25.986
No one has cheekbones like that.

01:34:26.369 --> 01:34:28.912
Nobody.

01:34:33.668 --> 01:34:35.836
I'm clocking out.

01:34:38.047 --> 01:34:40.875
- Good night, Paul.
- Good night.

01:34:41.301 --> 01:34:43.844
You know, Murray...

01:34:45.805 --> 01:34:49.600
I set out to be a
doctor to save lives.

01:34:51.102 --> 01:34:53.429
What happened?

01:35:26.721 --> 01:35:29.219
Simon!

01:35:30.016 --> 01:35:31.892
Who is it?

01:35:31.893 --> 01:35:34.595
The tooth fairy.

01:35:38.189 --> 01:35:40.525
Well, you're 55 years late,

01:35:40.526 --> 01:35:44.947
and you're uglier than
I thought you'd be.

01:35:46.074 --> 01:35:49.027
He'll sign now.

01:35:56.084 --> 01:35:59.336
- Hello, Murray.
- Vera.

01:35:59.337 --> 01:36:01.797
How's Barb gettin' on? Any news?

01:36:01.798 --> 01:36:06.378
- Yeah, she's good.
- Good!

01:36:07.011 --> 01:36:09.554
Wouldn't be too much,
would it, if I asked

01:36:09.555 --> 01:36:13.008
what in the name of God
you're doing here in our bed?

01:36:13.142 --> 01:36:17.688
Sorry, I know it's
after office hours.

01:36:18.898 --> 01:36:22.401
Well, it's not so much the
time that bothers me,

01:36:22.402 --> 01:36:25.737
it's the fact that we're
all here in bed together.

01:36:25.738 --> 01:36:30.284
It's the whole threesome thing
I'm not that comfortable with.

01:36:30.285 --> 01:36:34.615
Now, now, now! He doesn't
drop by that often.

01:36:35.164 --> 01:36:37.499
You won't be that
long, then, will ya?

01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:40.043
Not long.

01:36:40.503 --> 01:36:44.457
Very good, then. Hmm!

01:36:46.384 --> 01:36:47.884
Simon?

01:36:47.885 --> 01:36:50.178
Yes?

01:36:51.431 --> 01:36:55.635
Have you thought about what
happens after he signs?

01:36:56.602 --> 01:37:00.397
When he finds out who we really are?

01:37:00.398 --> 01:37:04.568
That it's all been lies, we've
been lying to him for a month?

01:37:06.195 --> 01:37:08.442
Little white lies.

01:37:10.825 --> 01:37:12.909
It'll kill him.

01:37:13.810 --> 01:37:16.239
It'll absolutely kill him.

01:37:19.876 --> 01:37:23.003
So, we're down to two
choices, really.

01:37:23.004 --> 01:37:26.965
We can throw the fish back in the water,
call off the seduction thing with Paul,

01:37:26.966 --> 01:37:30.260
concentrate on Anderson
from the oil company...

01:37:31.596 --> 01:37:35.849
or for 24 hours a day for the next five
years we can keep up the whole charade,

01:37:35.850 --> 01:37:37.809
but it has to be all the time.

01:37:37.810 --> 01:37:40.020
Paul must never know.
It'll break his heart!

01:37:40.021 --> 01:37:42.898
I'm telling you straight away, I am
not listening to jazz for five years!

01:37:42.899 --> 01:37:44.983
I mean, you try listening
to jazz fusion!

01:37:44.984 --> 01:37:47.277
I dare any one of you
to listen to jazz fusion!

01:37:47.278 --> 01:37:50.822
If I listen to one more jazz musician
blow his sorrow through his trumpet,

01:37:50.823 --> 01:37:54.910
I will kill myself! I will do it,
I will hang myself, I will...

01:37:54.911 --> 01:37:58.246
- The Lord is with you!
- And also with you!

01:37:58.247 --> 01:38:00.082
Let us pray!

01:38:00.083 --> 01:38:02.501
Uh, sorry for the interruption.

01:38:02.502 --> 01:38:07.127
- Uh, that's okay!
- I just want to say a few words, if I may.

01:38:07.590 --> 01:38:08.924
Okay!

01:38:08.925 --> 01:38:11.127
Thank you.

01:38:14.138 --> 01:38:17.887
Well, my month here is almost over,

01:38:18.059 --> 01:38:21.395
and, well, I wanted to tell all of you
that I've come to know Tickle Head

01:38:21.396 --> 01:38:25.816
as, well, tiny, lacking
gourmet restaurants,

01:38:25.817 --> 01:38:28.110
no offense, Joe,

01:38:28.111 --> 01:38:33.567
but there's something very
special here, very rare.

01:38:33.866 --> 01:38:37.945
You're all authentic
people, the real deal.

01:38:38.538 --> 01:38:42.333
Honest in your life and
true to each other.

01:38:43.709 --> 01:38:47.421
It would be an honour to
call Tickle Head home,

01:38:47.422 --> 01:38:49.798
be your new doctor,

01:38:49.799 --> 01:38:53.260
deliver your babies, fix your cuts,

01:38:53.261 --> 01:38:57.180
help all of you live
long, healthy lives.

01:38:57.181 --> 01:39:03.103
Um, we've already signed
Dr. Morris to the position.

01:39:06.065 --> 01:39:07.899
Sorry.

01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:11.153
Don't be. Congratulations.

01:39:11.154 --> 01:39:12.654
Mm-hmm.

01:39:12.655 --> 01:39:15.407
That's great. Congratulations.

01:39:15.408 --> 01:39:17.109
Okay.

01:39:17.743 --> 01:39:20.366
Yep!

01:39:29.172 --> 01:39:32.132
Is there a plan B you
haven't told us about?

01:39:32.133 --> 01:39:34.335
What's the plan? What's the...

01:39:36.888 --> 01:39:39.886
What'll we tell the oil company?

01:40:06.542 --> 01:40:10.045
Okay, all we need now is
the doctor's certificate.

01:40:10.046 --> 01:40:11.838
Uh, the certificate?

01:40:11.839 --> 01:40:14.837
Oh, we sent you that weeks ago.
You should have that.

01:40:17.762 --> 01:40:19.839
Well, we don't have it.

01:40:20.681 --> 01:40:23.683
Hmm... Henry, could you,
uh, check the certificate?

01:40:23.684 --> 01:40:25.806
Yup!

01:40:31.275 --> 01:40:33.397
Hey.

01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:36.192
Hi.

01:40:37.114 --> 01:40:39.441
Hi.

01:40:44.455 --> 01:40:50.210
Um, I have to catch a boat, and,
like, five planes to get home,

01:40:50.211 --> 01:40:54.836
but there's something
I need to say, okay?

01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:56.917
I'm single now,

01:40:57.093 --> 01:41:00.303
and it's definitely complicated,

01:41:00.304 --> 01:41:04.224
and I'm not ready for a
new relationship at all...

01:41:05.142 --> 01:41:10.063
but... but I feel I've
missed out on something,

01:41:10.565 --> 01:41:13.643
an occasion to meet someone special.

01:41:15.361 --> 01:41:19.110
And I want you to
know that I know...

01:41:20.741 --> 01:41:22.943
about your feelings,

01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:27.740
and that it's... it's okay, and...

01:41:30.543 --> 01:41:34.588
I mean, Murray told me everything.

01:41:34.922 --> 01:41:36.756
Everything?

01:41:36.757 --> 01:41:39.426
Yeah. I mean, he shouldn't have...

01:41:39.427 --> 01:41:43.263
but he... he revealed
your feelings for me.

01:41:43.264 --> 01:41:46.183
And what feelings would those be?

01:41:48.728 --> 01:41:51.476
That you love me.

01:41:53.608 --> 01:41:56.231
He said I love you?

01:41:56.527 --> 01:41:59.150
Yeah.

01:42:01.949 --> 01:42:03.821
That was a lie.

01:42:04.785 --> 01:42:06.411
A lie?

01:42:06.412 --> 01:42:09.456
You know nothing about people, Paul.

01:42:09.665 --> 01:42:12.584
They've all lied to you.

01:42:21.594 --> 01:42:24.843
- You do have a doctor?
- Yes.

01:42:25.473 --> 01:42:29.177
- Could we meet him?
- He's away at a conference.

01:42:29.977 --> 01:42:32.350
Here it is!

01:42:36.901 --> 01:42:40.528
That's, um... Oh, no,
no, that's not it!

01:42:40.529 --> 01:42:43.323
- Oh!
- No, that's a...

01:42:46.118 --> 01:42:51.198
In cricket, Murray, what's an over?

01:42:51.290 --> 01:42:52.999
Oh, well, it's a...

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.876
You have no idea, do you?

01:42:54.877 --> 01:42:58.046
You've been lying to me
for a month, is that right?

01:42:58.047 --> 01:43:00.924
No. Not exactly.

01:43:00.925 --> 01:43:02.547
Enough!

01:43:04.553 --> 01:43:07.972
What's the name of
Murray's dead son?

01:43:08.724 --> 01:43:11.301
Harvey.

01:43:14.855 --> 01:43:16.977
Why?

01:43:17.650 --> 01:43:19.859
Why can't anyone just
tell me the truth?

01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:21.812
Paul...

01:43:22.697 --> 01:43:26.241
- Paul!
- Is that the doctor?

01:43:27.284 --> 01:43:31.534
You want the truth?
Yeah, well, the truth is...

01:43:31.747 --> 01:43:34.916
it's been years since the
fishing dried up here. Years!

01:43:35.376 --> 01:43:37.836
We line up every month and
collect welfare cheques.

01:43:37.837 --> 01:43:40.004
You ever collect welfare, Paul?

01:43:40.005 --> 01:43:42.632
Well, you collect more than your
money, let me tell you that much!

01:43:42.633 --> 01:43:45.093
You collect shame. You collect
a good deal of shame.

01:43:45.094 --> 01:43:46.636
The money only lasts 15 days,

01:43:46.637 --> 01:43:49.180
but you get enough shame
to last a whole month!

01:43:49.181 --> 01:43:51.178
And it's killing us!

01:43:51.475 --> 01:43:53.552
We need jobs!

01:43:54.687 --> 01:43:56.813
I'll tell you the truth. I don't
wanna work for the oil company.

01:43:56.814 --> 01:43:58.857
I prefer to fish, but we're
not allowed to fish,

01:43:58.858 --> 01:44:00.980
not enough to make
a living, anyways!

01:44:01.068 --> 01:44:03.987
So I'll work for this
petrochemical-whatever-the-frig,

01:44:03.988 --> 01:44:06.781
and when they're gone,
we'll try something else,

01:44:06.782 --> 01:44:10.156
because it's worth it
to save this harbour.

01:44:10.703 --> 01:44:12.746
And I'm sorry we lied to you,

01:44:12.747 --> 01:44:15.957
because we hadn't the foggiest idea
how else to get a doctor here.

01:44:15.958 --> 01:44:19.753
We need a doctor to save 120 people,
to give them some kind of hope!

01:44:19.754 --> 01:44:23.339
- Did he say 120?
- No, he said 220.

01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:26.968
You've got the opportunity
here to be a real doctor.

01:44:26.969 --> 01:44:28.887
What about Dr. Morris?

01:44:28.888 --> 01:44:31.386
That was a lie, too.

01:44:32.767 --> 01:44:37.270
That lie was for you,
but your choice, Paul.

01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:55.322
Would you learn to play cricket?

01:44:59.210 --> 01:45:01.503
No.

01:45:02.338 --> 01:45:05.632
Well, at least you're being honest.

01:45:12.848 --> 01:45:15.141
I'll be your doctor.

01:45:34.995 --> 01:45:38.790
- Want a drink?
- Yeah, really bad.

01:45:50.886 --> 01:45:52.678
You're buying!

01:46:12.700 --> 01:46:15.243
Thank you very much!

01:46:15.828 --> 01:46:19.998
Now, look, part of this,
you see, is not gonna...

01:46:20.833 --> 01:46:24.168
I mean, look at the space
you got over here!

01:46:47.359 --> 01:46:51.529
You're comin' home... if you want.

01:47:03.626 --> 01:47:05.953
We got the facility.

01:47:06.879 --> 01:47:09.206
We had more work than we needed.

01:47:09.965 --> 01:47:13.718
None of us got rich,
but we're comfortable again.

01:47:13.719 --> 01:47:16.554
Frank, check those meters!

01:47:16.555 --> 01:47:18.514
We can take holidays,

01:47:18.515 --> 01:47:21.968
send our kids back to
university or trade school.

01:47:22.645 --> 01:47:26.269
But the most important thing the
people of Tickle Head have now...

01:47:26.523 --> 01:47:28.691
is our pride.

01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:31.527
- Okay, Murray!
- What?

01:47:31.528 --> 01:47:33.821
That's enough. It's not
professional, okay?

01:47:33.822 --> 01:47:36.741
- What?
- Stop it!

01:47:42.081 --> 01:47:44.158
The houses are all done up.

01:47:44.667 --> 01:47:49.122
The health plan is the best.
Families are growing again.

01:47:57.346 --> 01:48:00.056
It was never backed up like
this when I was in charge here!

01:48:00.057 --> 01:48:01.808
You were the best, Henry!

01:48:01.809 --> 01:48:04.602
I was better than this guy!
Way better than this guy.

01:48:04.603 --> 01:48:07.397
You didn't take it all, did you?

01:48:16.949 --> 01:48:19.784
I can't begin to explain
the joy we feel

01:48:19.785 --> 01:48:22.783
at the end of the day just to be...

01:48:23.247 --> 01:48:25.620
a little tired.

01:48:34.675 --> 01:48:37.594
Mm, Murray!

01:48:52.609 --> 01:48:55.061
True happiness.

01:52:56.645 --> 01:52:59.393
