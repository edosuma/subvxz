00:00.010 --> 00:03.200
- It's time to take this to
the next level. - It's a key.

00:03.280 --> 00:05.040
I can't move in with him.

00:05.120 --> 00:07.680
Welcome to the celebration
of the first book

00:07.760 --> 00:10.000
to come out of Marsden House Publishing.

00:10.080 --> 00:13.200
You'll stay close by me, won't
you? In case I want anything.

00:13.280 --> 00:16.110
- Am I not losing my job?
- It's a promotion with a salary to match.

00:16.160 --> 00:18.060
Oh, Pete. An entree to the Cheshire set.

00:18.120 --> 00:19.680
We could arrange to meet up.

00:19.760 --> 00:22.670
- Would you like your husband present?
- We don't need to involve him.

00:22.720 --> 00:25.420
He mustn't see you. Just this
way. That's right. Lovely.

00:25.900 --> 00:26.430
[Shit.]

00:26.480 --> 00:28.920
There's a job at my old
care home. Part-time.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.360
With your pay rise that'd cover us.

00:31.440 --> 00:35.360
- Why don't you want to live with us? - I wish
it was that simple. - He's miserable, Tina.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.640
- Oh.
- Come on.

00:43.880 --> 00:47.320
- Did you remember the poppadoms?
- Sorry I'm late, meeting ran over.

00:47.400 --> 00:50.400
- Ah, that used to be my excuse.
- I remember her complaining.

00:50.480 --> 00:53.120
- Where's the kitchen roll?
- Oh, it's under the sink.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.720
- That's not where I keep it.
- It is now.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.800
Careful, that one's hot.

01:02.680 --> 01:05.440
- He's forgotten his shirt.
- Dad.

01:05.519 --> 01:08.080
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:08.160 --> 01:11.560
I was just thinking this is almost
exactly how I imagined it would be.

01:11.640 --> 01:15.200
- Here, dishwasher.
- Ah, yeah.

01:15.280 --> 01:16.920
Thank you.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.480
Yeah, I've told him to
rinse. He just won't listen.

01:19.560 --> 01:23.160
- Why buy a dog and then bark yourself?
- So you don't wear the dog out.

01:23.240 --> 01:25.480
That makes no sense.

01:26.840 --> 01:27.960
Next.

01:31.040 --> 01:33.960
- And finally... - My
room. - Er, the guest room.

01:34.040 --> 01:37.120
- Well, temporarily mine.
- Oh, might be a good nursery, this.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.320
Hm. That'd be one way
of getting rid of him.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.800
Seems like a drastic length to go to.

01:41.880 --> 01:44.520
Right, let's check the bathroom out.

01:48.560 --> 01:50.280
- Bye!
- Always a pleasure.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.440
- See you soon. - Thank you. - Bye.

01:53.520 --> 01:57.240
- I'm glad we're long past that stage.
- What, falling in love?

01:57.320 --> 02:01.040
- Moving in together, all that. Cracks
are already beginning to show. - What?

02:01.120 --> 02:03.240
It's OK, you're a bloke.
You wouldn't notice.

02:03.320 --> 02:05.880
Well, how long will it be
before they're having a row?

02:05.960 --> 02:08.520
Wouldn't be surprised if
they're already hard at it.

02:11.360 --> 02:13.360
God save Ireland!

02:15.680 --> 02:17.760
With our genes we'd make great babies.

02:27.560 --> 02:30.240
I was thinking out loud. I
didn't mean anything by it.

02:30.320 --> 02:35.600
- What? Saying what great babies you'd make
as you're having sex? - No! It was just after.

02:35.680 --> 02:38.710
I wasn't saying we should. I just
wondered what her opinion was.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.680
And what was it?

02:40.760 --> 02:42.920
With our genes we'd make great babies.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.560
At your age you'd make a better grandad.

02:49.080 --> 02:52.920
It just slipped out, as it were.
It was meant to be a joke.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.880
Yeah, but you can see why he
might take that seriously.

02:55.960 --> 02:57.200
Hm.

02:57.280 --> 02:59.920
Well, you have to admit
Tina has got a point.

03:00.040 --> 03:03.200
You know, I know I don't look my
age but I'm no spring chicken.

03:03.280 --> 03:07.430
- And you're a bollock short. - No, that makes
no odds, apparently. One ball is the same as two.

03:07.480 --> 03:10.440
Well, it would be if she
actually wanted kids.

03:10.520 --> 03:14.000
- Don't you?
- I don't know, Karen.

03:14.080 --> 03:16.840
I tried with Liam, but it didn't happen.

03:18.240 --> 03:22.120
Then when he died I thought, 'OK.

03:23.840 --> 03:26.240
It's not to be.'

03:26.320 --> 03:28.640
I was fine with that.

03:30.080 --> 03:32.760
Got on with my life as best I could.

03:32.840 --> 03:35.000
I never expected to fall in love again.

03:36.440 --> 03:38.760
And then along came Adam.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.720
Along came Adam.

03:45.920 --> 03:49.080
And, yeah, if we were both a bit younger,

03:49.160 --> 03:51.160
him a fair bit, then sure.

03:53.440 --> 03:56.000
But I don't know if I want
to go down that road again.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.120
You know...

04:00.360 --> 04:02.800
All that hope and despair.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.440
Is that what's holding you back?

04:09.120 --> 04:13.040
Tina, if you wanted children
once, does that change?

04:15.400 --> 04:19.040
- What if it's too soon?
- So how long do you wait?

04:19.120 --> 04:21.399
Two years? Five?

04:21.480 --> 04:23.960
You know, you'll be well
into your 40s by then.

04:24.040 --> 04:26.560
What you don't want is to
wake up one day and think,

04:26.640 --> 04:30.880
'OK, the time's right,' only to
realise that you've left it too late.

04:35.040 --> 04:38.240
It's a shame. You know, I always
fancied the idea of more children.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.280
- Oh. - I wouldn't want to start again.

04:40.360 --> 04:44.240
- You know, all that mopping up.
- And then there's all the gear.

04:44.320 --> 04:48.000
- Yeah, so much gear.
- And getting up in the middle of the night.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.950
Although at our age we're getting
up several times anyways.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.600
Maybe you could combine the two.

04:54.320 --> 04:57.440
Then you've got a toddler. You
don't want to be one of those dads

04:57.520 --> 05:00.600
who plays with their kids on the
floor and can't get up again.

05:00.680 --> 05:03.640
Worse still, in your mid-60s
sharing with a teenager.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.020
Well, I haven't found the
teenage years too bad.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.270
Well, it helps if you're
not living with them.

05:08.320 --> 05:10.720
Josh was a bit difficult.
'Course, we now know why.

05:10.800 --> 05:13.600
- Chloe's starting all that
puberty stuff. - Very tricky.

05:13.680 --> 05:16.760
- For girls and their fathers.
- Steer well clear, I say.

05:16.840 --> 05:19.320
- Well, at our age, yeah.
- Yeah.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.440
Yeah, you're right. So's
Tina. It's a stupid idea.

05:22.520 --> 05:25.440
It's a young man's game. I don't
know what I was thinking about.

05:25.520 --> 05:29.800
And anyway, I have Matthew.
Who'd need any more?

05:29.880 --> 05:33.680
You know? And the fact that Tina
doesn't want kids, well, it's...

05:33.760 --> 05:35.400
it's for the best, really.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.200
Yeah. It's for the best.

05:42.560 --> 05:46.000
OK, a book blogger wants to
have an interview with Bridie.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.600
- Oh, no, she won't do that.
- What, too nervous?

05:48.680 --> 05:51.920
No, too grand. She'll
only do national press now.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.600
She start to get right
up herself, that one.

05:54.680 --> 05:55.800
OK.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.680
Oh, you can set your watch by him.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.120
Oh. Hello.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.520
You're expecting Justin.
I must be a let-down.

06:07.680 --> 06:11.600
- Well, I don't know. Who are you?
- Benjamin Stevens. May I come in?

06:11.680 --> 06:14.320
- I'm doing my death out here.
- Yeah.

06:15.520 --> 06:18.960
Right. Er, let's start
again. Benjamin Stevens.

06:19.040 --> 06:22.760
Justin asked me to come. He's, er,
he's been detained in Los Angeles.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.640
- Oh. By the authorities?
- On business.

06:25.720 --> 06:28.720
He's basing himself out there
for... for the foreseeable.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.800
Oh, that's a shame. I used to
enjoy our investor meetings.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.920
Well, hope I can make
them just as satisfying.

06:39.240 --> 06:40.880
Hm.

06:41.640 --> 06:43.360
Er, Ramona. My PA.

06:43.440 --> 06:46.880
This is Benjamin, Justin's...
Er, sorry, what are you exactly?

06:46.960 --> 06:50.560
- His proxy.
- Poxy? I don't know this word.

06:50.640 --> 06:55.240
Well, it means that Benjamin is
Karren Brady to Justin's Alan Sugar,

06:55.320 --> 06:57.760
- his eyes and ears.
- No. I'm more than that.

06:57.840 --> 07:00.160
His mouth and lungs and large intestine.

07:00.240 --> 07:02.640
In his absence I'm empowered
to act on his behalf.

07:02.720 --> 07:05.040
You must think of me as if I am Justin.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.800
Right. Should we get down to business?

07:11.720 --> 07:13.360
Yeah.

07:22.360 --> 07:25.360
Do you sometimes feel like
we're the only grown-ups here?

07:25.440 --> 07:28.920
- Tell me about it. - I'm still trying
to work out where I know you from.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.960
Tinder? No, I'm joking. Haven't
used that for a couple of years.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.360
- You met someone, did you?
- Married someone.

07:36.440 --> 07:38.520
Not through Tinder. That didn't work out.

07:39.280 --> 07:41.280
Then I met someone else. How about you?

07:41.360 --> 07:45.120
- I've never used it.
- No, no, no. I mean are you, erm...?

07:45.200 --> 07:48.880
- Oh. Er, no, I'm single.
- Ah.

07:51.560 --> 07:54.600
- Perhaps it's Ireland?
- Not recently.

07:54.680 --> 07:56.870
I've lived in Chorlton
for the last ten years.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.680
Chorlton? Jeez. We're neighbours.

07:58.760 --> 08:01.460
I'm in Didsbury. Just moved
in with my girlfriend Tina.

08:02.720 --> 08:05.760
- Tina?
- Yeah. Hey...

08:05.840 --> 08:09.320
Know what? You should come
over one night and meet her.

08:09.400 --> 08:12.240
Sure the pair of you would
get on like a house on fire.

08:23.080 --> 08:24.760
All right, ladies?

08:26.240 --> 08:28.640
- Do you mind if I join you?
- I wish you would.

08:28.720 --> 08:30.600
We're sick of the sight of each other.

08:33.559 --> 08:35.840
I'm Pete, your new Entertainments Officer,

08:35.919 --> 08:38.880
and I wondered if there's
anything you'd like me to arrange.

08:38.960 --> 08:42.600
A new pack of cards. This one's
missing the ace of spades.

08:52.640 --> 08:55.920
Oh, hey, he's David Copperfield.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.080
- How did you do that?
- It was under your chair.

09:00.920 --> 09:02.800
So, what can we look forward to, Peter?

09:02.880 --> 09:05.160
- Well...
- Apart from death, of course.

09:05.240 --> 09:09.440
All the old favourites.
Bingo. Film club. Tea dance.

09:09.520 --> 09:12.840
- We need men. - At your
age? - Oh, not in that way!

09:12.920 --> 09:15.150
For the dancing. There
aren't enough go round.

09:15.200 --> 09:18.960
- I always get lumbered with Bernice.
- And she always insists on leading.

09:20.520 --> 09:23.080
'Find men.'

09:23.160 --> 09:25.060
Any idea where I should start looking?

09:25.120 --> 09:28.640
- Most are in the cemetery.
- I think we best not disturb them, eh?

09:28.720 --> 09:30.320
Ah, snap!

09:30.400 --> 09:34.800
Oh, Oona! We're playing Rummy!

09:34.880 --> 09:36.960
Seems a lot to spend on a party.

09:39.320 --> 09:42.120
Well, it would have been, but,
you know, it was a book launch.

09:42.200 --> 09:44.440
It was an investment
in the company's future.

09:44.520 --> 09:47.920
In a swimming baths. The cost would
suggest you had to drain them.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.440
- Perhaps you'd like a copy? - These are
the only sort of books that interest me.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.720
And yours don't make for pretty reading.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.600
I think I got here just in time.

09:58.680 --> 10:02.240
I was thinking of inviting a
friend from work one night.

10:02.320 --> 10:06.680
- Oh, you're making friends? - Well, she's the
only person I've got anything in common with.

10:06.760 --> 10:09.310
By that you mean the only
person born in the same decade?

10:09.360 --> 10:11.400
Same century, more like.

10:11.480 --> 10:14.560
- My diary's free.
- Oh, yeah. A foursome. That would work.

10:15.880 --> 10:17.880
Oh, look, you've done it again.

10:17.960 --> 10:20.040
It goes knives, forks, spoons.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.400
That's why it's divided into compartments.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.240
I'm sorry. I forget.

10:24.320 --> 10:26.640
Yeah, well, it saves time in the long run.

10:26.720 --> 10:30.280
- It seems like a bit of a faff.
- God, if we can't agree on that,

10:30.360 --> 10:32.840
we'd do a terrible job
of bringing up kids.

10:32.920 --> 10:36.560
- It's a good job we don't want
any. - Oi. - Any of our own.

10:53.440 --> 10:57.240
Oh! All right, team, look lively.
We've got a visit from management.

10:57.320 --> 11:00.320
Does this mean I'm gonna have
to treat you with respect now?

11:00.400 --> 11:04.040
- Stand up when you walk in?
- Could you? - Not easily.

11:04.120 --> 11:05.250
A salute will do.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.230
How are you finding the new job?

11:08.280 --> 11:10.720
- Well, yeah, it's challenging.
- Uh-huh.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.030
I'm sort of loving the
responsibility, though.

11:13.080 --> 11:15.200
Yeah, well, just don't
let it go to your head.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.750
Not a chance with you around
snapping at my ankles.

11:17.800 --> 11:20.080
Yeah, well, when you're
CEO, I'll still be here

11:20.160 --> 11:23.280
to remind you where you came from.
That's what friends are for.

11:26.360 --> 11:28.240
CEO.

11:30.320 --> 11:31.960
You're late.

11:32.040 --> 11:34.720
This is live radio. You're due on air.

11:34.800 --> 11:37.000
Yeah, well, I'm here now. They'll wait.

11:37.080 --> 11:40.520
Yeah. Well, I have been.
The last 20 minutes.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.440
Yeah, well, I didn't ask you to come.

11:42.520 --> 11:44.000
I don't need my hand holding.

11:44.080 --> 11:47.040
You needed waking up.
Another late night, was it?

11:47.120 --> 11:48.910
Are you like this with your daughters?

11:48.960 --> 11:51.430
All right, ladies. We're
late, on in five. Thank you.

11:51.480 --> 11:53.880
- 'This is KEY 103.
- Sorry we're late.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.120
- Dad.
- It's fine.

11:57.200 --> 11:59.960
They've all been fine.
Please just pick one.

12:00.040 --> 12:01.960
If you want to go, we can meet you later.

12:02.040 --> 12:04.960
- Yeah, just leave us your credit card.
- No, I'll wait.

12:07.440 --> 12:10.280
- David?
- Nikki!

12:10.360 --> 12:13.040
Oh, fancy seeing you here.
I wouldn't expect you to...

12:13.120 --> 12:15.840
What, you think I'm more sort of M&S?

12:15.920 --> 12:19.800
- No, not that.
- I'm shopping with my daughters.

12:19.880 --> 12:21.880
For my sins.

12:21.960 --> 12:24.120
I'm buying shirts for my husband for mine.

12:25.680 --> 12:28.960
Look, I'm sorry about the other
day. I didn't think he'd come home.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.640
Yes, yes. I rather got that impression.

12:31.720 --> 12:34.840
Oh, this colour would suit you.

12:37.640 --> 12:39.590
I'd like to see you again
if I haven't scared you off.

12:39.640 --> 12:42.440
No. Er, should I come round to the house?

12:42.520 --> 12:46.120
No. Let's meet somewhere more discreet.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.880
I'll text you.

12:52.720 --> 12:54.360
Who's that?

12:54.440 --> 12:56.320
Oh, she's a sort of potential client.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.480
She didn't look like a
client. She's attractive.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.560
Liv, do you think I could dress better?

13:04.640 --> 13:06.440
Not without help.

13:06.520 --> 13:09.320
- Well, would you? Help
me, I mean. - Sure.

13:09.400 --> 13:12.300
- What image are you after?
- Don't know. That's where you come in.

13:12.360 --> 13:15.200
Something that might
attract potential clients?

13:17.200 --> 13:20.080
- Can we go now?
- Good. Finally.

13:21.960 --> 13:25.080
Oh, hang on. I'll just, erm, I'll
just grab something for myself...

13:26.480 --> 13:28.480
.. since we're here.

13:30.360 --> 13:33.360
Two of last week's delegates
claim we made them ill.

13:33.440 --> 13:36.480
Probably an extortion
bid. Investigate, will you?

13:36.560 --> 13:38.280
Yeah? Right, yeah, I will.

13:38.360 --> 13:42.720
Oh, listen, while I've got you, next month's
conference on the treatment of phobias.

13:42.800 --> 13:46.880
- We've had a number of delegates
cancel, I'm afraid. - Oh, shit! Why?

13:46.960 --> 13:49.680
Fear of flying, mainly.
Three can't cope in crowds.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.480
I'm not gonna lie, numbers are so low

13:51.560 --> 13:54.110
there's a risk the agoraphobics
are gonna freak out.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.720
- This is no laughing
matter, Jenny. - No.

13:56.800 --> 13:59.160
We're going to have to
find a way to cut costs.

13:59.240 --> 14:02.280
- We could scrap the welcome drinks.
- And start a riot?

14:02.360 --> 14:05.480
Well, it won't be a very big
one, would it? More of a ruckus.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.920
Have you any good ideas?

14:08.040 --> 14:12.640
Well, with fewer delegates we won't
need so many staff, I suppose.

14:12.720 --> 14:15.000
There's a fair amount of fat, OK?

14:15.080 --> 14:17.600
You know, being in head
office, you don't realise.

14:17.680 --> 14:20.600
Hm, losing two would help the bottom line.

14:20.680 --> 14:23.040
Yeah, I don't envy you
having to tell them, though.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.200
No, but if you're
destined for high office,

14:25.280 --> 14:28.480
- you have to be prepared to
do it. - Yeah. - Are you, Jenny?

14:30.200 --> 14:32.120
- Me? - Well, you know where the fat is.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.120
Who better to cut it out?

14:38.240 --> 14:40.910
With our website you upload a
couple of photos of yourself,

14:40.960 --> 14:44.440
input your vital statistics,
and the software creates a model

14:44.520 --> 14:47.480
with your features and body type. Here.

14:47.560 --> 14:51.360
I'll show you what I mean. This
is the page I created for myself.

14:53.860 --> 14:54.960
Is that meant to be you?

14:55.600 --> 14:56.600
It is me.

14:57.160 --> 15:00.280
- In your dreams.
- I mean, you know, OK.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.270
A little bit of creative licence, maybe.

15:02.320 --> 15:05.240
- That would explain why none
of your clothes fit. - Mm-hm.

15:05.320 --> 15:07.840
- Why haven't you got any pubes?
- Taste.

15:07.920 --> 15:11.160
- That's tasteful?
- Well, the alternative isn't.

15:11.240 --> 15:15.920
Erm, well, look, now what you do is you have
to decide what clothes you're going to wear.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.480
- Underpants.
- OK.

15:18.560 --> 15:21.520
- Quickly!
- Erm, how about those?

15:21.600 --> 15:24.440
Oh, God, it's gross!

15:24.520 --> 15:26.400
- This is beyond weird.
- I know.

15:26.480 --> 15:29.640
- Those. - Right, OK, OK.
Boring but better, yes.

15:29.720 --> 15:33.880
You know, it's rather like Bunty
magazine when we were young.

15:33.960 --> 15:37.120
On the back page you cut
out this figure of a girl

15:37.200 --> 15:39.720
in different outfits and
dress her up in them.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.760
- You read Bunty?
- My sister did.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.760
Oh, I keep forgetting you have a sister.

15:45.840 --> 15:48.640
Yes, well, we don't really
talk about her, so...

15:50.680 --> 15:53.400
- He probably didn't mean it.
- Then why did he say it?

15:53.480 --> 15:56.280
- Because he's Adam. You can't
be surprised by that. - What?

15:56.360 --> 15:59.360
That he just casually says he
doesn't want any more children?

15:59.440 --> 16:02.560
No, because he speaks
before he engages brain.

16:02.640 --> 16:05.480
He and Rachel didn't intend
Matthew to be an only child.

16:05.560 --> 16:08.240
They just never got the chance for more.

16:08.320 --> 16:11.680
- Do you think he's changed his mind?
- I don't know. Ask him!

16:11.760 --> 16:14.160
Honestly, you're as bad as each other.

16:14.240 --> 16:18.760
- How's the makeover going? David
looking debonair? - Smoking.

16:18.840 --> 16:21.200
Even you might be tempted
to ride him again.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.240
- (Talk to him.)
- All right.

16:26.640 --> 16:31.080
- Bollocks. Did I say the wrong thing?
- I'm really pissed off with you.

16:32.560 --> 16:36.160
- Huh? - What makes you think
I don't want to have any kids?

16:37.680 --> 16:40.040
- What? - I mean, it's
news to me that you don't,

16:40.120 --> 16:42.480
but if that's how you
feel about it, that's fine.

16:42.560 --> 16:45.720
- I didn't say I didn't want to
have any more. - Yeah, you did.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.320
Oh, that was because you said you didn't.

16:48.400 --> 16:50.920
- I said I didn't? - Mm. - No, I didn't!

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
OK, right.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.640
Tina.

16:56.720 --> 16:58.320
Would you like to have children?

17:00.080 --> 17:01.840
No.

17:03.280 --> 17:05.119
OK.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.839
Yes! I don't know. Adam,
you're missing the point!

17:07.920 --> 17:11.319
- What am I missing?
- Sensitivity.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.560
Do you know, for years
I've closed my mind off

17:13.640 --> 17:15.520
to the thought of having any kids.

17:15.599 --> 17:18.390
And then you open the door on
the idea and slam it in my face

17:18.440 --> 17:20.430
before I've had a chance to think it over.

17:20.480 --> 17:22.560
Oh, OK. You want some
time to think it over.

17:22.640 --> 17:25.359
Five minutes might be nice, yeah.

17:25.440 --> 17:28.240
- You're always doing this.
- What?

17:28.319 --> 17:31.470
Sailing off ahead, leaving me in
your wake trying to catch you up.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.520
I... I only came in here for a beer.

17:35.360 --> 17:39.640
- I'm really pleased that we're
living together. - Me, too.

17:39.720 --> 17:42.360
So I'd just like to be
allowed a moment to enjoy it

17:42.440 --> 17:44.750
before we start thinking
about having a family.

17:44.800 --> 17:48.640
Absolutely. Of course. Yes.

17:50.440 --> 17:53.480
- But you're not ruling it out?
- Oh, God.

17:53.560 --> 17:56.680
- What? - You. You don't listen. - ...

18:01.880 --> 18:02.600
Gosh.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.960
Well, erm, yeah.

18:07.040 --> 18:10.800
- Well, erm, maybe lose the hat. - OK.

18:12.520 --> 18:16.200
- Dad! You look a million dollars.
- Well...

18:16.280 --> 18:19.720
- And that's how much it costs.
- Yeah, not much less.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.960
Well, yeah, it's... It's
an investment in my future.

18:23.040 --> 18:24.920
Mm-hm.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.720
Oh, OK. Let's just go ahead with it.

18:27.800 --> 18:29.600
Erm, can you punch that in?

18:41.480 --> 18:45.520
- Destined for high office?
- Yeah, that's what she said.

18:45.600 --> 18:49.320
Doesn't come without price, though.
It's like being in the Mafia.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.560
I probably have to do something horrible

18:51.640 --> 18:53.600
with a horse's head to prove my bones.

18:53.680 --> 18:56.550
That doesn't mean you have to
whack two of your colleagues.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.720
The fat is eating into the bottom line.

18:58.800 --> 19:01.040
You gotta do what you gotta do.

19:01.120 --> 19:04.640
- You're already talking like
senior management. - Mm, think so?

19:04.720 --> 19:06.480
It wasn't a compliment, Jen.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.640
Look, I don't want you to be part of this.

19:08.720 --> 19:11.280
Look, if I don't fire
them, somebody else will.

19:11.360 --> 19:13.790
Then they'll be destined
for flipping high office.

19:13.840 --> 19:16.160
Yes, but at least you'll
still have your soul.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.360
Question is, who gets the bullet?

19:23.240 --> 19:26.480
First choice is easy. Meg.

19:26.560 --> 19:30.000
Been with the firm five years, as
clueless as the day she arrived.

19:31.400 --> 19:32.920
There's Jeremy.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.600
He's a bit pointless, but shows promise.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.040
Lynn? Nah.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.040
Can't be her. Big hit with the fellas.

19:40.120 --> 19:43.960
Then there's Tracey,
slack, sloppy and shit.

19:45.320 --> 19:48.400
Jen! No, no, no!

19:48.480 --> 19:51.760
- She's your friend.
- It's business.

19:51.840 --> 19:56.600
- But she's in a wheelchair.
- So? - So that's discrimination.

19:56.680 --> 19:58.600
No, it's not.

19:58.680 --> 20:01.920
Listen, Tracey has always
insisted on being treated equally.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.680
- That's what I'm doing.
- She might never work again.

20:04.760 --> 20:07.400
Should have done her job
better, then, shouldn't she?

20:11.960 --> 20:13.720
All this power...

20:14.720 --> 20:16.560
.. making me feel a bit Sexy Suzy.

20:16.640 --> 20:19.760
- Oh, look, come on, Jen...
No. - No? - I'm serious.

20:19.840 --> 20:23.640
For your sake I won't
allow you to fire Tracey.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.520
How exactly do you propose to stop me?

20:25.600 --> 20:28.600
Well, if you can assure me
that Tracey's job is safe,

20:28.680 --> 20:32.320
then, and only then, will I be prepared...

20:33.680 --> 20:36.640
.. to satisfy your carnal desires.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.520
Goodnight.

20:45.980 --> 20:49.160
- All right, chaps?
- Oh, my God. Look at you.

20:49.240 --> 20:51.640
I thought I'd debut my new
image. What do you think?

20:51.720 --> 20:54.120
Well, it's gonna be wasted on this lot.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.240
- What are we doing here?
- Come on.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.960
He told me he wanted help
shifting the furniture.

21:00.980 --> 21:03.430
We've been going over this for
two days and I'm very busy.

21:03.480 --> 21:05.430
So unless you have any other questions...

21:05.480 --> 21:07.880
You have other authors
you're working with?

21:07.960 --> 21:10.670
Well, I intend to. But at the
moment I'm focusing on Bridie.

21:10.720 --> 21:12.800
- All your eggs in one basket.
- Golden eggs.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.750
So long as she keeps laying. If
she doesn't, we're in trouble.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.880
Do you know what? I really need to get on.

21:17.960 --> 21:20.680
How long until her
second novel is published?

21:20.760 --> 21:24.200
- Er, well, we're working on that.
- Oh. What's it called?

21:24.280 --> 21:27.520
- The title?
- I believe that's the technical term.

21:27.600 --> 21:30.520
We're working on that,
too. Excuse me one minute.

21:30.600 --> 21:33.160
I just have to look at something.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.160
Ramona, Ramona.

21:37.240 --> 21:41.000
- Put this call through to me now, OK?
- Huh? What call?

21:41.080 --> 21:42.480
That call through to me now.

21:45.040 --> 21:47.160
OK, what were we saying?

21:47.240 --> 21:50.440
- The title of Bridie's new book.
- Oh, yes.

21:50.520 --> 21:52.560
Oh, sorry.

21:52.640 --> 21:55.440
- Karen Marsden.
- Karen, I don't understand.

21:55.520 --> 21:57.240
(It's the Frankfurt Book Fair.)

21:57.320 --> 21:59.560
Elke! Hi. How are you
doing? Great to hear you.

21:59.640 --> 22:01.360
- Elke?
- Hang on a minute.

22:01.440 --> 22:04.520
(She tends to go on a bit, so can
we continue this another time?)

22:04.600 --> 22:06.560
- Hello? - Yeah, yeah,
yeah. I'm still here.

22:06.640 --> 22:08.760
You can see yourself
out, can't you, Benjamin?

22:10.240 --> 22:12.680
Hi, yeah. How's Helmut?

22:12.760 --> 22:15.160
- Who's Helmut?
- Yeah, and little Klaus?

22:21.380 --> 22:22.760
God almighty.

22:24.080 --> 22:26.680
Paloma? Er, no, it's Ramona, isn't it?

22:26.760 --> 22:28.680
- Yeah.
- Tell me, Bridie's new book...

22:28.760 --> 22:32.480
- Ah, she start writing it!
- Start? Don't you mean finish?

22:34.160 --> 22:38.200
Ugh! My English. He is not very good.

22:38.280 --> 22:40.640
No. But he's not that bad.

22:46.600 --> 22:51.080
Arsehole. Thank God for that.
He was doing my head in!

22:52.760 --> 22:53.320
Oh!

22:53.400 --> 22:56.240
It would not be wise
to play me for a fool.

22:56.320 --> 22:58.160
Call me with a publication date,

22:58.240 --> 23:00.640
and if you don't want
this partnership dissolved,

23:00.720 --> 23:03.120
it had better be soon...
publication, that is.

23:03.200 --> 23:05.840
I'll be back tomorrow.

23:24.920 --> 23:27.280
Nobody wants to dance with me.

23:27.360 --> 23:30.260
Reminds me of our old disco
days, sitting on the sidelines.

23:30.320 --> 23:32.880
That was you. I was in
the middle doing my stuff.

23:32.960 --> 23:37.200
- I bet those two aren't even lesbians.
- Why don't you just cheer up, eh?

23:38.240 --> 23:40.120
This is about Tina moving in.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.390
Jenny suspected there'd
be teething trouble.

23:42.440 --> 23:44.280
She's quite perspicacious, isn't she?

23:44.360 --> 23:46.440
Well, if that means
'meddlesome', then yes.

23:46.560 --> 23:49.800
- I just don't understand
her. - Who, Jenny? - Tina!

23:49.880 --> 23:52.440
You know, one minute she
doesn't want children,

23:52.520 --> 23:54.840
the next minute she does,
or maybe she doesn't.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.400
Bloody women, eh?

23:58.480 --> 24:03.240
- God, how many sugars are in
that? - Three, usually. - Jesus.

24:03.320 --> 24:05.640
You've just got your wires
crossed, that's all.

24:05.720 --> 24:07.960
It's just the stress of setting up house.

24:08.080 --> 24:11.680
You know, it's not easy,
especially when you're older.

24:11.760 --> 24:13.790
You're used to having
things a certain way.

24:13.840 --> 24:16.230
But having a third person
around, that can't help.

24:16.280 --> 24:19.120
- It's not Matt's fault.
- I meant David.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.560
Maybe you ought to send him on his way.

24:24.960 --> 24:28.600
- Mm. Can I have a second glass?
- You already did.

24:30.640 --> 24:33.360
You're not gonna get much
done if you're half-pissed.

24:33.440 --> 24:35.760
I don't intend to be half-pissed.

24:35.840 --> 24:40.000
Bridie, this won't do. When do
you think you might deliver?

24:40.080 --> 24:42.950
God, do you understand anything
about the writing process?

24:43.000 --> 24:45.910
I know how scary it can be,
particularly on the back of a success.

24:45.960 --> 24:48.790
You know nothing. The most
you've written is a shopping list.

24:48.840 --> 24:51.440
- OK, that's enough. She
doesn't want that. - Yes, I do.

24:51.520 --> 24:53.520
Take it away.

24:57.440 --> 24:59.920
I want to see everything you've written.

25:06.120 --> 25:08.600
- You won't like it.
- Where's the rest of it?

25:08.680 --> 25:11.480
- That's all I'm happy with.
- What do you mean, that's all?

25:11.560 --> 25:13.200
Bridie, you've had months.

25:13.280 --> 25:15.430
I've got 300 pages but
it's all over the place.

25:15.480 --> 25:17.380
I'm not even sure it's all the same story.

25:17.440 --> 25:20.800
OK. Calm down, OK. I'm gonna
read everything you've written,

25:20.880 --> 25:24.600
all 300 pages of it, and then
we're gonna see where we stand.

25:24.680 --> 25:28.160
- I'm just up to my ears in shit!
- I'm sure that's not true.

25:28.240 --> 25:30.400
I hope it isn't, or I'm even deeper in it.

25:32.840 --> 25:35.200
You move so gracefully.

25:35.280 --> 25:38.360
- And you dress so well.
- Thank you, Vera.

25:38.440 --> 25:40.520
Are you by any chance a homosexual?

25:42.360 --> 25:46.080
- I was hoping to impress the ladies.
- Oh, you have.

25:46.160 --> 25:49.480
If I hadn't had both hips replaced,
you'd have no say in the matter.

25:51.640 --> 25:54.680
I can't believe you don't have admirers.

25:54.760 --> 25:57.480
Well, I have recently met someone.

25:58.680 --> 26:01.120
And my daughters think
she might be interested.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.960
Ooh, well, I'm sure she is.

26:04.080 --> 26:07.600
- So why do I sense some reticence?
- (She's married.)

26:07.680 --> 26:10.240
Oh, well, that's their
look-out, not yours.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.680
That was always my attitude

26:12.760 --> 26:16.000
whenever some handsome young
fellow made eyes at me.

26:16.120 --> 26:18.160
And what did your husband say to that?

26:18.240 --> 26:19.380
Oh, David.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.960
He didn't know.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.760
Don't be old and have regrets, David.

26:25.840 --> 26:29.040
Life's too short to care about convention.

26:35.160 --> 26:37.440
Peter, would you care for the next dance?

26:37.520 --> 26:39.680
Vera, I would be delighted.

26:42.360 --> 26:43.880
Unbelievable.

26:47.360 --> 26:51.560
So, Len Goodman, have you found
anywhere else to live yet?

26:51.640 --> 26:54.440
- I haven't started looking.
- Would you mind?

26:54.520 --> 26:56.840
Of course, of course.

26:56.920 --> 26:59.400
It was very good of you
to have me there at all.

26:59.480 --> 27:02.280
Oh, no rush. End of the
week should be fine.

27:16.840 --> 27:18.600
Thanks for coming, team.

27:19.920 --> 27:23.360
As instructed, I have
completed my investigation.

27:23.440 --> 27:27.000
Now it just remains for me to
apportion blame, I'm afraid.

27:27.080 --> 27:31.000
Do we have to? I mean, it could have
just been an accident, couldn't it?

27:32.200 --> 27:35.720
Actually, the food ordered at the
hotel was of the highest quality,

27:35.800 --> 27:38.390
which is all credit to the
person who chose the menu.

27:38.440 --> 27:40.920
Well, that was me.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.680
Or would be, if we hadn't served Carpaccio

27:44.760 --> 27:47.320
at a conference for vegetarians.

27:47.400 --> 27:50.240
- Well, I wasn't to know...
- Vegetarians don't eat meat?

27:50.320 --> 27:53.680
.. what Carpaccio is. I thought
it was a cold vegetable soup.

27:53.760 --> 27:56.800
- Yeah, that's gazpacho.
- They sound very similar.

27:56.880 --> 27:59.160
Look, it was an honest mistake.

27:59.240 --> 28:03.160
That caused nausea and threats to sue.

28:03.240 --> 28:06.800
Which is why I have no alternative

28:06.880 --> 28:12.120
than to say that for you, Tracey,
this is the end of the process.

28:13.720 --> 28:15.560
You're fired.

28:15.640 --> 28:19.240
- You fired Tracey?
- No!

28:19.320 --> 28:23.560
Well, briefly. I was
only messing with her.

28:25.320 --> 28:28.400
Oh, wait, wait! You're not fired.

28:29.720 --> 28:31.640
I'm making you redundant instead.

28:35.720 --> 28:39.080
Well, I'm sure that made
her feel a whole lot better.

28:39.160 --> 28:41.840
Not really, no. Although
it should have done.

28:41.920 --> 28:45.280
I mean, that way she serves
a notice and gets a payoff.

28:45.360 --> 28:49.360
- I didn't have to do that. I
only did it cos I care. - Care?

28:50.840 --> 28:52.520
Caring's what I do.

28:52.600 --> 28:55.320
Looking after the sick and the vulnerable.

28:55.400 --> 28:58.400
I'm not sure if you know the
meaning of the word any more.

29:04.640 --> 29:11.640
â™ª Do you get high.....

29:21.440 --> 29:23.760
- Hey, son. Can I come in?
- Yeah.

29:32.440 --> 29:34.560
Don't really know how to say this, but...

29:36.320 --> 29:39.360
.. would it upset you if Tina
and I were to try for a baby?

29:39.440 --> 29:42.080
- Well, imagining it does.
- No, no. I mean...

29:43.680 --> 29:47.520
.. how would you feel if you
had a half-brother or -sister?

29:47.600 --> 29:49.600
A half-sibling?

29:49.680 --> 29:51.840
I don't know.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.760
- Might be a bit weird.
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.760
Why?

30:01.000 --> 30:03.120
Well...

30:03.200 --> 30:05.320
- You're a bit old.
- Thank you.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.280
Does Tina want a baby?

30:08.840 --> 30:11.800
- I don't know, to be honest.
- Shouldn't you ask her?

30:11.880 --> 30:14.040
You'd think it would
be simple. I've tried.

30:14.120 --> 30:19.040
But women, they can be
very complicated creatures.

30:19.120 --> 30:22.430
Sometimes it's like they're speaking
an entirely different language.

30:22.480 --> 30:25.120
- Swahili. - Have you
thought of learning Swahili?

30:25.200 --> 30:27.720
- I'm speaking figuratively,
Matthew. - So am I.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.840
What I mean is

30:29.920 --> 30:33.000
maybe you need to look beyond the words,

30:33.080 --> 30:36.480
and try a little harder
to discern their meaning.

30:36.560 --> 30:39.520
Hm. Interesting.

30:41.080 --> 30:43.080
- You're 16, right?
- And a half.

30:43.160 --> 30:44.920
Must be a good school.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.440
- My mum's genes.
- Your Dad's looks.

30:53.160 --> 30:55.360
Thanks, mate.

31:02.540 --> 31:03.740
I'll get it, shall I?

31:04.320 --> 31:06.120
Come on, move.

31:09.640 --> 31:11.910
Do you fancy coming for
dinner one night, David?

31:11.960 --> 31:14.000
Thank you. Yes, yes, I'd love to.

31:14.080 --> 31:16.720
- Can you cook? - Huh?
- I don't have time.

31:16.800 --> 31:19.920
- I gave the girls beans on toast
the other night. - Yeah, sure.

31:20.000 --> 31:24.080
I could help you out. Actually,
I've got a favour to ask you.

31:25.800 --> 31:28.600
You see, Adam's kicking me
out at the end of the week.

31:28.680 --> 31:32.080
And I just wondered, whilst I'm
looking for something long-term

31:32.160 --> 31:35.200
and, er, you know, while Josh
is away at university, if...

31:40.360 --> 31:42.040
So...

31:44.280 --> 31:46.800
- .. on the subject of babies... - Mm.

31:53.400 --> 31:55.680
I'm not gonna ask you again.

31:55.760 --> 31:58.040
I know it's complicated.

32:00.640 --> 32:04.440
It's 15 years since Rachel died.
It's only six since you lost Liam.

32:05.800 --> 32:07.800
You're still raw.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.520
In time you'll decide one way or another,

32:11.600 --> 32:13.840
and then you'll let me know.

32:19.880 --> 32:21.880
I have decided.

32:24.640 --> 32:27.200
I would like a baby with you.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.840
Really?

32:32.080 --> 32:34.640
If you still want to.

32:34.720 --> 32:38.240
- You don't think I'm too old?
- Mm, getting there.

32:39.880 --> 32:42.400
Well, there's no time like the present.

32:42.480 --> 32:44.620
- Brace yourself, Bridget.
- No.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.280
I don't mean right now.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.440
Just in time.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.280
Look, we can't leave it too long.

32:53.360 --> 32:57.120
I mean, you know, I'm pushing
50. You're closing in on 40.

32:57.200 --> 32:59.640
Eh, not as fast as you're nearing 50.

32:59.720 --> 33:00.840
Cheeky bastard.

33:04.280 --> 33:08.440
Well, maybe we should just
leave it to chance, eh?

33:08.520 --> 33:13.200
Not try for a baby, not 'not try' for one.

33:13.280 --> 33:15.440
Isn't that the same thing?

33:17.240 --> 33:19.240
Possibly.

33:19.320 --> 33:21.680
Is that what you'd like to do?

33:22.680 --> 33:24.120
Yes.

33:25.760 --> 33:28.240
But only if you want to.

33:30.600 --> 33:32.240
(OK.)

34:05.520 --> 34:07.200
- David.
- Nikki.

34:07.280 --> 34:09.199
Lovely to see... Oh, the shirt.

34:09.280 --> 34:11.840
Yes, yes. You suggested it might suit me.

34:14.360 --> 34:17.360
- I was right.
- Good.

34:17.480 --> 34:20.760
Thank you. Erm, I hope I
haven't been too presumptuous.

34:20.840 --> 34:24.760
- It's a bit early.
- Oh, it's never too early for champagne.

34:24.840 --> 34:28.480
- What shall we drink to?
- What would you like to drink to?

34:29.880 --> 34:34.600
Let's drink to us. To, erm, a
mutually beneficial relationship.

34:36.719 --> 34:39.080
May my husband never find out.

34:40.719 --> 34:41.800
Right.

34:43.679 --> 34:47.239
- So, let's get down to it, shall we?
- Can't we finish our drinks?

34:47.320 --> 34:50.440
- Well, we can do both at the
same time, can't we? - Huh?

34:50.520 --> 34:52.639
It's not like anybody's gonna be watching.

34:54.080 --> 34:55.920
This is about your finances.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.040
Salting money away where
George can't find it. What...?

35:01.640 --> 35:03.240
Now, you mentioned unit trusts.

35:03.320 --> 35:06.000
Do you happen to have the
application forms with you?

35:06.080 --> 35:09.800
By complete stroke of luck, I have.
Let's sit down somewhere, shall we?

35:16.040 --> 35:18.040
You're avoiding me, missus.

35:19.040 --> 35:22.520
- Clearly not. - You are, though.
You don't stop for a chat any more.

35:22.600 --> 35:25.320
You duck out of meetings
that I am in. I mean...

35:28.240 --> 35:32.360
I can't talk about it. Not here.

35:33.400 --> 35:35.040
Oh.

35:35.120 --> 35:38.200
OK, well, look, do you want to
meet for a drink after work?

35:38.280 --> 35:40.280
Pub across the road?

35:42.600 --> 35:45.240
- OK.
- OK.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.800
Thank you, David. I, er...

35:54.880 --> 35:57.920
I really appreciate your
help and your discretion.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.920
Absolutely, Nikki.

36:00.920 --> 36:02.680
Absolutely.

36:21.520 --> 36:23.520
Hi, Tracey.

36:24.640 --> 36:27.120
You all right, Pete? Good to see you.

36:27.200 --> 36:29.680
Erm, Jenny's not here.

36:29.760 --> 36:31.480
Head office, most like.

36:31.560 --> 36:35.160
Well, it wasn't her I came
to see. Do you have a minute?

36:35.240 --> 36:38.520
In a couple of weeks I'll have more
time than I know what to do with.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.360
Yeah, about that...

36:41.880 --> 36:45.760
So, is it, er, you know,
any good? Any good?

36:46.640 --> 36:49.120
Well, you could always read it yourself.

36:49.200 --> 36:51.800
I'll defer to your judgment.

36:51.880 --> 36:53.600
Thank you, Benjamin.

36:54.720 --> 36:57.040
The answer is no, it's not good.

36:57.120 --> 36:59.880
It needs re-writing,
re-structuring, more re-writing.

36:59.960 --> 37:02.720
But then it will be every
bit as good as The Deep End.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.680
So, when will it be ready?

37:04.760 --> 37:07.000
Oh, the question you really want answered.

37:07.080 --> 37:09.600
- I'll get it!
- That depends on Bridie, doesn't it?

37:10.680 --> 37:13.830
But I am confident that we could
make publication by Christmas.

37:13.880 --> 37:15.720
That's what I need to hear.

37:18.160 --> 37:20.360
Er, Mum...

37:20.440 --> 37:23.320
- your author's here.
- Ah, the golden-egg-layer.

37:23.400 --> 37:27.240
- I finally meet her.
- Well, invite her in.

37:32.320 --> 37:33.800
Excuse me, Benjamin.

37:35.800 --> 37:39.080
Oh, my God, what's happened? Bridie?

37:40.440 --> 37:42.040
For God's sake.

37:42.120 --> 37:45.400
Oh, I'm a fraud, Karen.

37:45.480 --> 37:47.440
I'm Emily Bronte.

37:47.520 --> 37:50.600
Mary Wollstonecraft. Harper Lee.

37:50.680 --> 37:54.400
- What's she on about? - One-hit wonders.
- She has a high opinion of herself.

37:54.480 --> 37:57.360
- I have nothing left to give.
- Oh!

37:59.200 --> 38:03.400
- She got that wrong.
- Come, Ramona, help me get her up.

38:03.480 --> 38:05.080
Come on.

38:05.160 --> 38:07.240
Olivia? What's wrong?

38:09.120 --> 38:11.560
Ramona, come on. Help me
get her to the bathroom.

38:11.640 --> 38:14.320
Ellie, will you make some
coffee, please? Oh, come on.

38:18.920 --> 38:22.200
- By Christmas.
- Oh, my God.

38:22.280 --> 38:27.040
- Oh, come on, Bridie.
- Ugh. - Up you go.

38:27.120 --> 38:29.320
Jen, thank you so much.

38:29.400 --> 38:32.160
You're welcome. What for?

38:32.240 --> 38:36.160
Oh. Oh, I see. Best
pretend you don't know.

38:36.240 --> 38:39.240
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
What are we talking about?

38:39.320 --> 38:42.680
The job Pete's found me. It's perfect.

38:42.760 --> 38:44.080
The one at his care home.

38:44.160 --> 38:47.720
Easy hours, nice warm office, and a
clientele that's mostly medicated.

38:47.800 --> 38:50.520
- I can't thank you enough!
- Yeah, that's OK.

38:50.600 --> 38:53.190
To be honest, I thought you
were hanging me out to dry.

38:53.240 --> 38:55.920
'Bitch,' I thought. But Pete
said you're not like that.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.240
You wouldn't turn your back on a friend.

39:02.680 --> 39:05.680
Here you go. Got us
doubles. It's happy hour.

39:10.440 --> 39:14.400
For the next hour-and-a-half.
No need to rush.

39:14.480 --> 39:17.080
So, you really don't know
where you know me from, do you?

39:17.160 --> 39:19.960
I thought it had to be
the company website.

39:20.040 --> 39:22.320
You used to live in the centre of town.

39:22.400 --> 39:25.640
- Spring Gardens, yeah.
- I came to your apartment block.

39:25.720 --> 39:27.760
We met in your hallway about a year ago.

39:27.840 --> 39:31.680
- Hello, can I help you?
- I'm looking for a woman.

39:33.160 --> 39:35.400
She's having an affair with my husband.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.480
Oh, my God, that was you.

39:40.560 --> 39:44.000
- You remember, then?
- Of course.

39:46.040 --> 39:49.560
You pretended she was your
wife to throw me off the scent.

39:50.840 --> 39:52.520
It worked.

39:53.560 --> 39:57.040
It was only later I found
out that he was with her.

39:58.320 --> 39:59.920
Tina.

40:02.720 --> 40:05.360
So, it's probably best I
don't come round for dinner.

40:05.440 --> 40:07.160
Don't you think?

40:15.560 --> 40:18.160
Karen, I've been such a bitch to you.

40:18.240 --> 40:21.200
- Not that bad.
- You haven't read my last interview.

40:22.280 --> 40:24.000
Oh.

40:24.080 --> 40:25.680
Mum?

40:34.520 --> 40:36.360
I didn't mean any of it.

40:36.440 --> 40:39.000
But everyone keeps
telling me I'm brilliant.

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
Second album syndrome.
Don't worry about it.

40:43.080 --> 40:44.920
We'll get through it, OK?

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
But you are gonna have to look
at your drinking and partying.

40:48.080 --> 40:50.080
And the drugs.

40:51.400 --> 40:53.400
It's when I'm alone...

40:55.960 --> 40:58.040
.. the fear really kicks in.

41:04.040 --> 41:05.680
Hiya.

41:07.280 --> 41:08.360
How was your day?

41:19.160 --> 41:20.800
Tracey told me what you've done.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.200
- Thank you, Pete.
- I didn't do it for you.

41:26.760 --> 41:28.640
I know you didn't.

41:29.640 --> 41:31.640
Thank you anyway.

41:32.760 --> 41:36.160
Listen, I'm not going to apologise
for something I just don't feel...

41:36.240 --> 41:41.960
I don't want you to apologise
because it would be insincere.

41:42.040 --> 41:44.640
- Jen, I know you wanted
to impress your boss. - Oh.

41:44.760 --> 41:46.800
But to do it at the expense of a friend,

41:46.880 --> 41:50.200
especially when I begged
you not to do it...

41:50.280 --> 41:54.080
I think we both know where
your priorities lie, eh?

41:55.600 --> 41:59.160
I think you better go and tell the
kids that their dinner's almost ready.

42:12.480 --> 42:14.600
But, Karen, I've been counting on you.

42:14.680 --> 42:17.680
Look, I'm sorry, David, but I've
gotta put Bridie in Josh's room.

42:17.760 --> 42:21.520
- You've still got a few days
to find somewhere. - Sure. Sure.

42:21.600 --> 42:23.600
Bye, David.

42:27.880 --> 42:31.760
Adam, this is the third estate
agent I've been to today.

42:31.840 --> 42:34.360
Seriously, cos I'm looking
at properties now and...

42:34.440 --> 42:38.240
- I mean, there's really nothing I can...
- Well, there's no need.

42:38.320 --> 42:41.280
- Tina's taken pity on you.
- I'm sorry, she's what?

42:41.360 --> 42:44.160
She says while the nursery's
free you might as well use it.

42:44.240 --> 42:46.600
- Oh, that's...
- It's only a stay of execution, mind.

42:46.680 --> 42:49.440
At some point we might need
that room for someone else.

42:49.520 --> 42:53.760
- Of course, yes. Thank you.
Both of you. Thank you. - Hm.

42:53.840 --> 42:56.560
- Mr David Marsden?
- Yes?

42:56.640 --> 42:59.790
My employer wondered whether he
might have a conversation with you.

42:59.840 --> 43:02.360
- You come highly recommended.
- Oh, that's very nice.

43:02.440 --> 43:05.160
- Why doesn't he give me a call?
- He'd prefer a face-to-face

43:05.240 --> 43:08.920
- due to the sensitivity
of the matter. - Right.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.440
- He's free now if you have the time.
- Er, yes, I have the time.

43:12.520 --> 43:14.240
But I... I don't have my car.

43:14.320 --> 43:16.360
That's all right. I can give you a lift.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.360
Oh, that makes it easy.

43:22.440 --> 43:24.320
I didn't catch your employer's name.

43:27.120 --> 43:28.380
Hello. David Marsden.

43:54.960 --> 43:56.800
Should you not have gone by now?

43:58.720 --> 44:02.520
- Can I talk to you about something?
- Ah, the day finally dawns

44:02.600 --> 44:04.680
when the youth seeks his father's counsel,

44:04.760 --> 44:07.800
hoping that the elder's wisdom
can assist and sustain him

44:07.880 --> 44:10.360
through the myriad
challenges that lie in wait

44:10.440 --> 44:13.560
upon this arduous journey
that we call life.

44:16.560 --> 44:18.640
Olivia is pregnant.

44:19.305 --> 44:25.869
