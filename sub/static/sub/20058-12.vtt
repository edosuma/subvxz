00:22.708 --> 00:25.583
Come on, Eon.
Shake this off.

00:28.458 --> 00:32.042
Oh... dear.

00:32.125 --> 00:34.583
Eon, I got you some chicken soup

00:34.667 --> 00:39.375
and one of those Skylands smoothies
with two darkness immunity shots.

00:39.458 --> 00:40.958
Master Eon?

00:41.042 --> 00:43.375
Eon! Eon?

00:43.458 --> 00:45.250
Oh, my!
You're getting worse.

00:45.333 --> 00:48.333
Your beard is soaked with sweat.

00:48.417 --> 00:52.708
Hugo... I...
have been touched by darkness,

00:52.792 --> 00:56.833
and I'm afraid it is now overcoming me.

00:56.917 --> 00:58.625
Oh! What do we do?

00:58.708 --> 01:01.542
The only thing we can.

01:01.625 --> 01:04.292
Skylanders, u...

01:09.583 --> 01:11.167
...nite.

01:43.375 --> 01:45.958
Sir, you must eat something.

01:46.042 --> 01:48.417
Food will not help me now, Hugo.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.875
No, I need the power
of something much greater.

01:50.958 --> 01:54.625
The power of light to counter the darkness
coursing through my veins.

01:54.708 --> 01:56.042
Where do we find that?

01:56.125 --> 01:59.167
You must journey
to the Isle of the Citadel.

01:59.250 --> 02:02.625
The Citadel!
We'd heard legend of its existence. You...

02:02.708 --> 02:04.125
You're saying it's real?

02:04.208 --> 02:06.958
Indeed. It's a place I built
with my own two hands

02:07.042 --> 02:09.750
from the ground up after the Great War.

02:09.833 --> 02:13.750
I lived there alone for some time
while figuring out what to do next

02:13.833 --> 02:16.792
to protect the Skylands from threats.

02:16.875 --> 02:19.792
Which led me
to starting the academy, of course.

02:19.875 --> 02:23.000
The Citadel is home to some of the
greatest secrets in Skylands.

02:23.083 --> 02:25.625
Secrets essential to our very existence,

02:25.708 --> 02:28.917
which is why
I've hidden it under a shroud of magic.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.458
No Skylander team
has ever gone to the Citadel,

02:31.542 --> 02:33.875
and only the brave of heart
and strong of mind

02:33.958 --> 02:36.417
can overcome the obstacles
you will face there.

02:37.333 --> 02:41.500
Once you do, you will find
the light energy necessary to cure...

02:41.583 --> 02:43.833
to... to cure me.

02:43.917 --> 02:45.708
Master Eon! No!

02:45.792 --> 02:48.958
He's in terrible shape.
You must hurry, Skylanders!

02:49.042 --> 02:51.458
Once you find the source of light energy,

02:51.542 --> 02:54.417
fill this and bring it back to Eon.

02:54.500 --> 02:57.875
He says he needs to drink it
in order to overcome the evil within.

02:57.958 --> 02:59.792
So how do we get to the Citadel, Hugo?

02:59.875 --> 03:01.375
Eon said all you had to do

03:01.458 --> 03:03.833
was stand on the tile
that represents your element.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.583
- What?
- Seriously?

03:05.667 --> 03:07.667
How have we never noticed that before?

03:07.750 --> 03:09.875
We can talk about it later, Eruptor.
Let's move!

03:12.250 --> 03:14.458
- It's a portal!
- Whoa!

03:16.792 --> 03:18.500
Whoa!

03:18.583 --> 03:20.292
So which way do we go?

03:20.375 --> 03:22.542
Let's see where the path takes us,
shall we?

03:26.292 --> 03:28.042
You bellowed, ma'am?

03:28.125 --> 03:30.833
Glumshanks,
I am headed to Skylander Academy

03:30.917 --> 03:32.417
to retrieve my book of spells

03:32.500 --> 03:36.125
and I need you to keep
Kaos preoccupied until I return.

03:36.208 --> 03:38.458
I cannot have him
interfering with my plans today.

03:38.542 --> 03:41.125
-Understood?
-Never fear, ma'am.

03:41.208 --> 03:45.542
I have several tried-and-true ways
of keeping your son distracted for hours.

03:46.292 --> 03:48.750
Sir, guess what night it is?
Game night!

03:48.833 --> 03:50.500
And I've got all your favorites.

03:50.583 --> 03:53.208
Skyopoly.
Cards Against Troll Dignity.

03:53.292 --> 03:55.083
Mumblety-peg.

03:56.458 --> 03:57.708
No games tonight, Glummy.

03:57.792 --> 04:00.875
I've got much bigger fish to catch,
debone, and fry.

04:00.958 --> 04:03.458
My powers have grown considerably

04:03.542 --> 04:06.458
since I laid my hot little hands
on Mother's book.

04:06.542 --> 04:09.208
And I'm not about to let that go away.

04:09.292 --> 04:12.333
I am going to get that book back
so Mother can see its effect.

04:12.417 --> 04:14.917
Once she realizes how strong I've become,

04:15.000 --> 04:16.500
surely then she will teach me

04:16.583 --> 04:20.208
how to properly wield the dark power
found inside the book.

04:20.291 --> 04:22.667
Sound points all, sir,
but seeing how it'll be dark soon

04:22.750 --> 04:25.833
and, uh, you haven't had dinner yet,
and, oh, um, uh... Hey, hey!

04:25.917 --> 04:27.542
Remember that time
you roasted me on a spit?

04:27.625 --> 04:29.292
Now, that was some quality pain.

04:29.375 --> 04:31.667
I'd totally be up for a little more
of that. What do you say?

04:31.750 --> 04:34.083
That was a special time.

04:34.167 --> 04:35.167
Nope, I'm out of here.

04:35.250 --> 04:39.167
Uh, sir, going to Skylanders Academy
is a horrible idea

04:39.250 --> 04:43.250
and I, uh, uh... I...
I forbid you to leave!

04:44.625 --> 04:46.625
You forbid me?

04:46.708 --> 04:50.083
Hmm.
Well, I guess that settles it, then.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.042
Sorry, Glummy, what was that?

04:53.125 --> 04:54.917
Are you still trying to
tell me what to do?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.958
Can't understand you.

04:59.708 --> 05:03.958
Skylanders Academy
is a swell idea.

05:04.042 --> 05:07.417
Oh, good!
So happy you agree.

05:08.333 --> 05:10.000
Off we go, Glum-wad.

05:10.083 --> 05:12.292
Yes, sir.

05:13.708 --> 05:15.292
All right, Chompy Puppet.

05:15.375 --> 05:18.500
Let's go get
that evil book of spells for ourselves.

05:18.583 --> 05:21.000
- Chomp-tacular idea!
- Ow!

05:21.083 --> 05:23.667
-Watch where you're going, bush with feet!
-Dreamcatcher?

05:23.750 --> 05:25.958
Chompy?
What are you doing here?

05:26.042 --> 05:29.167
I thought all of us Doom Raiders agreed
to come get the book as a group tomorrow.

05:29.250 --> 05:32.042
You're not double-crossing us, are you?

05:32.125 --> 05:34.125
Who, me?
No way!

05:34.208 --> 05:35.792
I was, uh... I was, uh...

05:35.875 --> 05:38.708
getting ideas for some yard work
I need done. That's--

05:38.792 --> 05:41.750
Wait, why are you here alone?

05:41.833 --> 05:44.583
Me?
Right, well, um...

05:44.667 --> 05:48.417
Just need to be sure
there ain't no Skylanders around.

05:48.958 --> 05:51.958
Nope, just Dreamcatcher in a cloud suit.

05:52.042 --> 05:54.417
- Dreamcatcher?
- Pepper Jack?

05:54.500 --> 05:56.500
- Chompy?
- Wolfgang?

05:56.583 --> 05:59.125
- What?
- Hey, hey!

05:59.208 --> 06:00.875
Uh, what are you guys doing here?

06:00.958 --> 06:03.083
What are
you all doing here?

06:03.167 --> 06:05.083
Have you all seriously come

06:05.167 --> 06:08.250
to try and take Kaossandra's spell book
for yourselves?

06:08.333 --> 06:10.167
That was not the plan!

06:10.250 --> 06:12.000
We're sorry, Your Gold-ness.

06:12.083 --> 06:14.583
-We'll stick to the script from now on.
-So...

06:15.625 --> 06:16.875
why are you here?

06:16.958 --> 06:20.750
Because... uh, because I am your leader
and can do whatever I want

06:20.833 --> 06:22.458
and never question
my questionable motives.

06:22.542 --> 06:24.375
Oh, seriously, you guys?

06:24.458 --> 06:26.917
You all told me
you were going to the beach today.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.500
Doom Raiders?

06:28.583 --> 06:32.375
You all must have
so many screws loose to show up here.

06:32.458 --> 06:33.750
Skylanders!

06:33.833 --> 06:37.333
Come together in a consolidated formation!

06:37.417 --> 06:39.333
You mean, "Skylanders unite"?

06:39.417 --> 06:40.542
Yeah, that!

06:43.708 --> 06:45.417
This glowing door is locked.

06:45.500 --> 06:48.833
Did anyone bring a glowing skeleton key?

06:48.917 --> 06:51.625
I am your first obstacle.

06:51.708 --> 06:54.542
To pass, tell me true,

06:54.625 --> 06:56.875
what do you fear most of all?

06:56.958 --> 07:00.250
Nothing! Wait.
I mean... Kaos!

07:00.750 --> 07:02.250
Guys, we're making it worse.

07:02.333 --> 07:05.542
Uh, never living up
to my father's expectations.

07:05.625 --> 07:07.000
Jet-Vac's eggs.

07:07.083 --> 07:08.917
Um, uninformed political discourse.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.250
What is it
we're truly afraid of right now?

07:11.333 --> 07:13.375
Whatever it is, we can't be wrong again,

07:13.458 --> 07:16.125
or we'll never get through this door
and save Eon!

07:16.208 --> 07:17.875
We're afraid of losing Eon!

07:19.375 --> 07:22.750
Obstacle number one defeated.

07:22.833 --> 07:25.292
You may move on to obstacle number two.

07:25.375 --> 07:26.583
-Awesome!
-Great answer.

07:26.667 --> 07:27.667
-Right on!
-You did it, Spyro!

07:27.750 --> 07:30.417
Come on, guys,
let's get to that next obstacle.

07:34.333 --> 07:36.333
Yeah, you better run!

07:36.417 --> 07:37.917
Shouldn't we go after them, Ka-Boom?

07:38.000 --> 07:39.625
We're short-handed, Snap Shot,

07:39.708 --> 07:42.667
and we can't leave the cadets alone
to defend the academy.

07:42.750 --> 07:47.042
We need all the hands on deck here
in case the Doom Raiders come back.

07:47.125 --> 07:49.542
Everyone, we're on high alert!

07:49.625 --> 07:53.042
Patrol the perimeter
and be ready for anything!

07:57.792 --> 07:59.958
Eon? Sir?

08:00.042 --> 08:02.208
How are you doing?

08:02.292 --> 08:04.667
I shall destroy you,
puny Mabu!

08:04.750 --> 08:06.208
Eon, no! Please.

08:08.042 --> 08:09.042
Oh, Hugo.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
It's the darkness.

08:11.083 --> 08:12.250
I am not myself.

08:12.792 --> 08:15.792
Until I am healed of this sickness,

08:15.875 --> 08:17.750
no one is safe.

08:17.833 --> 08:20.000
-Even you.
-How can I help, sir?

08:20.083 --> 08:21.875
Lock me in here.

08:21.958 --> 08:23.208
No one enters,

08:23.292 --> 08:27.417
unless it's the Skylanders
with that vial of healing light.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.875
Yes, sir.

08:29.958 --> 08:31.792
Hurry, Skylanders.

08:34.792 --> 08:36.707
Hello.
Are you here for the quest?

08:36.792 --> 08:38.375
Yes!
Are you our next obstacle?

08:38.457 --> 08:41.750
Well, my friends call me Dale,
but for your purposes,

08:41.832 --> 08:44.042
yep, I'm the next obstacle.

08:44.125 --> 08:46.250
Or, rather, its gatekeeper.

08:46.333 --> 08:49.875
Anyhoo, answer my riddle correctly
and you can be on your way.

08:49.958 --> 08:53.375
Unless you want to sit a spell
with a lonely, old wizard

08:53.458 --> 08:56.750
who simply yearns
for some occasional human contact.

08:56.833 --> 08:58.625
Uh, we'll just take the riddle, sir.

08:59.833 --> 09:03.208
Sure.
It's always "just the riddle."

09:03.875 --> 09:06.125
Very well.

09:06.208 --> 09:10.417
What I am, you cannot see, touch, or hear.

09:10.500 --> 09:14.583
I lie behind the stars and alter reality,

09:14.667 --> 09:17.417
but I am sometimes what you fear.

09:17.500 --> 09:20.708
Close your eyes, even if briefly,

09:20.792 --> 09:23.917
and I'll always reappear.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.250
What am I?

09:26.417 --> 09:28.667
Oh, and you only have ten seconds.
Go!

09:28.750 --> 09:30.292
A space ghost?

09:30.375 --> 09:31.375
Ooh, feelings!

09:31.458 --> 09:33.542
A seriously old wizard
whose riddles are hard?

09:33.625 --> 09:35.208
Come on, guys.
Think harder!

09:35.292 --> 09:37.333
Seems like you're gonna fail.

09:37.417 --> 09:41.542
We're probably all doomed now.
Thanks for that. Four seconds.

09:41.625 --> 09:43.958
Come on! Come on!
What is it we're missing?

09:44.042 --> 09:47.458
I don't know, but if this is the end,
I'm gonna close my eyes.

09:47.542 --> 09:49.292
It's so dark.

09:49.375 --> 09:52.333
The dark... You see the dark
when you close your eyes.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.042
"Darkness" is the answer, right?

09:57.167 --> 09:58.167
You got it!

09:58.250 --> 10:00.750
Obstacle number two defeated.

10:00.833 --> 10:03.500
You may move on
to obstacle number three.

10:04.875 --> 10:06.708
Thanks, old wizard dude.

10:06.792 --> 10:10.125
Good luck!
And come visit me whenever you like.

10:10.208 --> 10:12.167
Please?

10:13.750 --> 10:17.750
I wish I hadn't outlived my entire family.

10:18.667 --> 10:22.292
Well, at least no one saw us
get our behinds whipped.

10:27.417 --> 10:29.167
What a well-oiled machine you are.

10:29.250 --> 10:32.542
Staging an attack on Skylander Academy
while the Skylanders are gone,

10:32.625 --> 10:35.292
and you get beaten by cadets.
Cadets!

10:35.375 --> 10:38.042
Well, well, look who it is.

10:38.125 --> 10:42.250
You've come down from your castle
for the first time in years.

10:42.333 --> 10:45.875
That book of yours must be as powerful
as everyone thinks it is, Kaossandra.

10:45.958 --> 10:49.208
You have no idea.

10:49.292 --> 10:51.833
But now that you've got
the academy on high alert,

10:51.917 --> 10:54.292
it will be tougher than ever
to get it back.

10:54.375 --> 10:56.792
Which is why the only way
that can happen now

10:56.875 --> 10:59.792
is if we work together.

10:59.875 --> 11:01.292
And why would we do that?

11:01.375 --> 11:05.125
Because I don't particularly feel like
fighting off the entire school on my own.

11:05.208 --> 11:08.333
And if we take it down,
the place is all yours.

11:08.417 --> 11:12.917
You'll let us have the academy
and whatever comes with it?

11:13.000 --> 11:16.750
All of it.
I just want my book.

11:19.417 --> 11:20.417
We're in.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.500
Super. Now let's go.

11:22.583 --> 11:26.458
Looking forward to seeing
what your powers are capable of.

11:26.542 --> 11:29.708
I don't believe anyone has seen
you use your magic before.

11:29.792 --> 11:31.792
All we've heard are rumors.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.375
Let's hope I don't have to use them.

11:34.458 --> 11:38.333
It's been a while
and my magic can be... unpredictable.

11:38.417 --> 11:41.458
-What about Kaos?
-Don't worry about him.

11:41.542 --> 11:44.792
He won't be screwing this up
any worse than he already has.

11:45.708 --> 11:47.000
Remember the plan, Glummy.

11:47.083 --> 11:49.292
I wish I could forget it, but alas...

11:49.958 --> 11:52.000
Uh, excuse me, can I help you?

11:52.083 --> 11:53.542
Uh, yes.

11:53.625 --> 11:57.208
My son here wants to attend
Skylander Academy,

11:57.292 --> 11:59.250
so we've come to tour the campus.

11:59.333 --> 12:03.708
And what powers do you possess
that qualify you to become a Skylander?

12:03.792 --> 12:06.375
Uh, well, you see,
I've got this fin, right?

12:06.458 --> 12:07.875
So obviously, I'm a shark.

12:07.958 --> 12:10.625
And I use bubble gum bubbles to...
to, uh,

12:10.708 --> 12:12.042
blow my enemies away.

12:12.125 --> 12:15.917
For I am the all-mighty Gum Shark.

12:20.208 --> 12:21.208
Right.

12:21.292 --> 12:24.833
You might want to start considering
a nice tech school, young man.

12:24.917 --> 12:27.208
As for now, the academy is on high alert,

12:27.292 --> 12:29.708
so I must insist
you come back another day.

12:29.792 --> 12:32.542
And I insist you choke on this!

12:35.375 --> 12:36.542
It's Kaos!

12:36.625 --> 12:38.708
Yah!

12:39.917 --> 12:43.000
The main hall.
Let's go, Glummy.

12:43.542 --> 12:46.333
The only place you're goin' is down, pal.

12:46.417 --> 12:47.833
And don't forget about us.

12:48.583 --> 12:50.000
Well, it seems
we're outnumbered, sir, so...

12:58.542 --> 13:00.667
What a day!
What a lovely day!

13:04.542 --> 13:07.708
Didn't anyone teach you
it's dangerous to play with blades?

13:07.792 --> 13:09.792
Ha! Sweet wordplay, Chompy Mage.

13:09.875 --> 13:11.875
-Mother?
-Kaos!

13:11.958 --> 13:13.292
I told you to keep him busy!

13:13.375 --> 13:15.417
I tried, ma'am,
but his powers, they've grown.

13:15.500 --> 13:17.958
I've never seen him
have such command of his magic.

13:18.042 --> 13:20.083
It's, and I can't believe
I'm saying this,

13:20.167 --> 13:21.792
impressive.

13:21.875 --> 13:25.375
Hear that, Mother?
I'm getting stronger.

13:25.458 --> 13:27.542
And I know it has to do with your book,

13:27.625 --> 13:30.083
which is why I came
to get it back for you.

13:30.167 --> 13:33.333
Consider it an early Mother's Day gift.

13:33.417 --> 13:36.792
Can we please continue this chat
inside the academy?

13:36.875 --> 13:37.958
Of course, my queen.

13:38.042 --> 13:40.792
Wolfie, lay down a serious hypno-groove.

13:45.833 --> 13:48.208
Yeah!

13:50.667 --> 13:52.208
So, what's the plan, Mother?

13:52.292 --> 13:54.750
The plan is
I'll handle this and you do nothing.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.833
You've done more than enough already.

14:05.125 --> 14:06.333
There's nothing there.

14:06.417 --> 14:08.792
I don't get it.
Was there another path we missed?

14:08.875 --> 14:10.375
Did we go the wrong way?

14:10.458 --> 14:13.750
-We gotta go back.
-If we go back, Eon won't...

14:13.833 --> 14:17.583
No.
This is the way. I know it.

14:17.667 --> 14:19.333
What are we supposed to do, Spyro?

14:19.917 --> 14:21.208
We take a leap of faith.

14:21.292 --> 14:23.333
- Are you nuts?
- He's gone completely bonkers.

14:23.417 --> 14:25.792
Easy for you to say, Spyro.
You can fly!

14:25.875 --> 14:28.958
No, I said "we."
We do this together, as a team.

14:29.042 --> 14:32.083
Spyro, mate,
I want to help Eon as much as you do,

14:32.167 --> 14:33.667
but this? Well, this is--

14:33.750 --> 14:35.292
The only chance we've got.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.875
Why else would the path lead us here
if it wasn't testing our bravery?

14:39.708 --> 14:41.792
Okay, I'll do it.

14:41.875 --> 14:43.500
You ain't going without me.

14:43.583 --> 14:44.792
You gotta go sometime!

14:44.875 --> 14:47.208
Oh, like I'm going to be the one
who ruins it for everybody?

14:47.292 --> 14:48.583
Fat chance.

14:48.667 --> 14:51.375
Skylanders, let's do this.

14:57.583 --> 14:58.625
- Yes!
- It worked!

14:58.708 --> 15:00.208
- That was so scary.
- Aw! We lived?

15:02.625 --> 15:05.042
Obstacle number three defeated.

15:05.125 --> 15:07.667
Welcome to the Core of Light.

15:08.750 --> 15:10.292
The Core of Light.

15:10.375 --> 15:14.042
The key to balance
and harmony in our world.

15:16.667 --> 15:18.292
I can't believe we're here.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.833
This is, like, the coolest thing
I've ever seen.

15:20.917 --> 15:25.333
You hear the legends as a child,
but to actually see it...

15:25.417 --> 15:27.250
It's so beautiful.

15:27.333 --> 15:29.542
I could just stand here
and look at it forever.

15:29.625 --> 15:31.875
Guys! Guys!
Remember why we're here.

15:31.958 --> 15:33.083
Master Eon!

15:43.667 --> 15:45.458
Uh...

15:45.917 --> 15:47.875
Oh, sorry, that's me. Hello?

15:47.958 --> 15:49.458
Jet-Vac, it's Hugo!

15:49.542 --> 15:52.500
You and the Skylanders
got to get back to the academy!

15:52.583 --> 15:53.792
What's wrong? Is it Eon?

15:53.875 --> 15:58.125
Yes! No! It's way more than that.
The academy is under attack!

16:02.583 --> 16:05.417
Where is that fool
who runs this accursed academy?

16:05.500 --> 16:06.500
In there!

16:07.542 --> 16:10.833
The Relics Room is just beyond
that double-vault bookshelf.

16:10.917 --> 16:13.792
I always forget
the stupid beard scanner.

16:13.875 --> 16:14.917
Now what do we do?

16:15.000 --> 16:17.167
I'll handle this.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.458
Hello, Eon.
Knock, knock.

16:26.542 --> 16:28.208
Who is there?

16:28.292 --> 16:31.917
Doom! Destruction! Darkness!

16:35.083 --> 16:37.750
Leave no relic unturned, Doom Raiders!

16:37.833 --> 16:40.375
Everything here is ours for the taking.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.750
You used one of my spells, didn't you?

16:43.833 --> 16:45.417
Old fool!

16:45.500 --> 16:48.208
I did...

16:48.292 --> 16:51.875
what I had to, to help someone in need.

16:51.958 --> 16:53.708
And now who's the one
that needs help?

16:53.792 --> 16:55.208
Will you ever learn?

16:55.292 --> 16:57.667
Yes! I found it again.

16:57.750 --> 17:01.292
It's the map to the Core of Light.
Now we can finally go there

17:01.375 --> 17:03.833
- and destroy it, my queen.
- You dolt.

17:03.917 --> 17:05.625
I used my power

17:05.708 --> 17:07.875
to move the location
of the Core of Light.

17:07.958 --> 17:11.583
Somewhere you will never find it.

17:11.666 --> 17:14.333
The map... is useless.

17:14.416 --> 17:16.250
What? No!

17:16.333 --> 17:17.750
There, there, Kaos.

17:17.833 --> 17:20.958
At least we have what we came for.

17:21.041 --> 17:22.750
My book!
Hand it to me.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.083
I think not.

17:24.166 --> 17:25.666
Doom Raiders, we are done here.

17:25.750 --> 17:28.667
Just what do you think
you're doing, Goldie?

17:28.750 --> 17:31.250
I'm taking your book
and you cannot stop me.

17:31.333 --> 17:33.833
Well, don't ever say
you didn't ask for it.

17:33.917 --> 17:36.083
Sir, get over here! Now!

17:36.167 --> 17:38.875
-Glummy!
-Kaos, join us.

17:38.958 --> 17:43.458
Together, we will rule the realm,
like you've always dreamed.

17:43.542 --> 17:46.042
Kaos, come here!
Do not disobey me!

17:46.125 --> 17:48.250
What has she ever done for you?

17:48.333 --> 17:51.667
Keep you from learning
the true breadth of your power?

17:51.750 --> 17:54.542
Shun you from the day you were born?

17:58.542 --> 18:02.583
Turn you into the laughingstock
of Skylands?

18:03.375 --> 18:04.375
Why, Mother?

18:04.458 --> 18:07.083
Why wouldn't you teach me
how to be as powerful as you?

18:07.167 --> 18:08.792
I have my reasons, Kaos.

18:08.875 --> 18:12.083
I do not need to justify them
to you or anyone else.

18:12.167 --> 18:13.250
Now, or ever!

18:13.333 --> 18:15.750
But all I ever wanted was to be like you.

18:15.833 --> 18:17.917
I know I can be!

18:18.000 --> 18:19.208
I will be.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.375
Please, just show me the way.

18:22.458 --> 18:24.667
I... can't.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.375
Son, you must trust me on this.

18:28.125 --> 18:29.208
Very well.

18:30.125 --> 18:32.583
I choose... them.

18:33.667 --> 18:35.875
Then you leave me no choice.

18:41.333 --> 18:43.333
Ma'am?

18:43.417 --> 18:47.208
-Are you okay?
-I will be. My book...

18:47.292 --> 18:49.833
There's no time, ma'am.
We must leave now!

18:49.917 --> 18:51.542
No! Not yet.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.125
Mother!

18:55.208 --> 18:56.583
You can't leave me behind.

18:56.667 --> 18:59.167
You made your choice.
Now live with it.

19:00.458 --> 19:02.083
Never come home.

19:03.042 --> 19:05.292
You're out.
Forever.

19:07.667 --> 19:10.583
Uh-oh. We gotta go, Doom Raiders.

19:10.667 --> 19:13.125
Your Gold-ness, take me with you.

19:13.208 --> 19:16.250
I proved where my loyalties lie,
didn't I?

19:16.333 --> 19:17.375
Come.

19:17.458 --> 19:19.958
You are a Doom Raider now.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.708
Whoa!
What the heck happened?

19:28.792 --> 19:29.875
Master Eon!

19:29.958 --> 19:31.500
We did it, Master Eon.

19:31.583 --> 19:33.750
We found the Core of Light
and filled the vial.

19:33.833 --> 19:35.083
Here. Here, drink.

19:42.292 --> 19:43.542
Skylanders!

19:44.417 --> 19:46.875
You saved me.

19:48.917 --> 19:51.292
Sir, how are you feeling?

19:51.375 --> 19:54.208
Mmm, good as new, Spyro.

19:54.292 --> 19:56.000
Thanks to your heroic efforts.

19:56.083 --> 19:59.667
And this Skylands smoothie.
What flavor is it, again?

19:59.750 --> 20:01.708
Evil-eating elderberry.

20:01.792 --> 20:04.583
-Most delicious.
-So what happens now, Eon?

20:04.667 --> 20:08.375
I will take this book somewhere
its evil power can hurt no one ever again.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.000
We're so happy you're okay, Eon.

20:11.542 --> 20:13.583
Well, I'm happy I have all of you.

20:13.667 --> 20:18.125
I wouldn't be standing here without you.
And neither would Skylander Academy.

20:18.208 --> 20:19.458
Now, go home.

20:19.542 --> 20:22.208
It has been a day, hasn't it?

20:29.250 --> 20:31.708
- Did you bring it?
- Of course.

20:31.792 --> 20:35.750
And now I know beyond a shadow of a doubt
that it belongs with you.

20:35.833 --> 20:38.542
-Thank you.
-Just do what needs to be done.

20:54.958 --> 20:56.667
The book?

20:56.750 --> 20:59.875
You possess it again?

20:59.958 --> 21:04.875
Yes. Which means
you aren't going anywhere.

21:06.042 --> 21:07.750
So, here we are, my queen.

21:07.833 --> 21:09.958
Running this gang side-by-side.

21:10.042 --> 21:12.750
Want me to make them build us a hut?
Find us some food?

21:12.833 --> 21:14.958
What does a creature
made of gold eat, anyway?

21:15.042 --> 21:18.917
I, alone, lead this gang
and you work for me now.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.500
-Uh, but I thought we were going to--
-Do me a favor

21:21.583 --> 21:23.167
and leave the thinking to me.

21:23.250 --> 21:27.042
Now then, tell us all you know
about your mother's spell book.

21:27.125 --> 21:28.417
Why do you care about that?

21:28.500 --> 21:31.208
Judging by the way
Kaossandra risked her own neck

21:31.292 --> 21:32.792
to get that book back,

21:32.875 --> 21:35.208
I am more convinced than ever

21:35.292 --> 21:39.500
that it holds the key
to darkness reigning over Skylands.

21:39.583 --> 21:42.542
And you are going to help us discover

21:42.625 --> 21:46.750
what secrets the book,
and your mother, keeps.

21:46.833 --> 21:50.542
And we will use them
to end the Skylanders forever.
