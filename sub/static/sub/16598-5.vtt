00:01.001 --> 00:02.170
Previously on The Exorcist...

00:02.203 --> 00:04.105
JULIA:
Kat, look at me.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.707
(gasps)

00:06.740 --> 00:08.876
There is something
inside my house.

00:08.909 --> 00:12.012
It's a demon, and it's
trying to take my daughter.

00:12.046 --> 00:15.015
(screaming, gagging)

00:15.049 --> 00:17.151
HENRY:
I pray at night, I ask Him

00:17.185 --> 00:20.821
what I would be doing if that
scaffolding hadn't collapsed,

00:20.854 --> 00:22.323
screwed my head up.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.925
The demon inside that girl knew
about me in Mexico City.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.427
They're communicating
with one another.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.329
They are sharing information.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.730
SALESMAN: Try it.
You'll like it.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.366
Why resist, darling?

00:32.400 --> 00:33.434
This isn't like
you said it'd be.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.736
Something's not right here.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.171
SALESMAN:
See what you made me do?

00:37.205 --> 00:38.506
You're back.
Yeah, well, it turns out

00:38.539 --> 00:40.874
I've got unfinished business
in Chicago.

00:42.110 --> 00:44.112
This woman,
she needs my help.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.614
The Church told me I cannot,
but I'm going to do it anyway.

00:46.647 --> 00:50.184
Tomas Ortega,
rule breaka.

00:50.218 --> 00:52.886
Any other lines
you're thinking of crossing?

00:52.920 --> 00:54.222
ANGELA: Are you willing
to perform the exorcism?

00:54.255 --> 00:56.090
Whoa. Exorcism?

00:56.124 --> 00:58.792
Who brought up exorcisms?
She's not getting better.

00:58.826 --> 01:01.295
Maybe that's because she needs
specialists and not priests.

01:01.329 --> 01:03.097
Stop it! Stop it! Stop!

01:03.131 --> 01:05.133
Please!

01:05.166 --> 01:06.600
Okay, okay, whatever you want.

01:06.634 --> 01:09.069
I will sign Casey's
discharge papers, Mrs. Rance.

01:09.103 --> 01:10.304
Because I've exhausted
my options here.

01:10.338 --> 01:11.605
I don't know what else to do.

01:11.639 --> 01:13.774
I take it the
demon's manifested?
Yes.

01:13.807 --> 01:15.209
So what are you waiting for?
You.

01:15.243 --> 01:16.610
Will you help me?

01:16.644 --> 01:17.911
MARCUS:
You're prepared to take this...

01:17.945 --> 01:19.447
TOMAS:
As far as it goes.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.982
MARCUS: Good, happens
to be the only way I know.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.623
*

01:40.434 --> 01:42.603
Isn't that the
Book of Revelation?

01:45.439 --> 01:47.141
Where is that?

01:47.175 --> 01:49.977
It's called Charnwood Forest.

01:50.010 --> 01:51.445
Near where I was born.

01:51.479 --> 01:54.815
Woods, rocks, caves.

01:54.848 --> 01:58.552
Some say it's where
King Lear went mad.

02:00.354 --> 02:04.692
My mum used to take me there
sometimes for walkies.

02:07.461 --> 02:10.198
Probably the only thing
she was good for.

02:15.203 --> 02:16.970
You all right?

02:17.004 --> 02:18.939
(dog barking in distance)

02:18.972 --> 02:22.443
I worry about them.

02:22.476 --> 02:25.045
I can feel the toll
it is taking.

02:25.078 --> 02:29.217
These last two days
have been...

02:30.384 --> 02:32.186
You're good at this, you know.

02:33.854 --> 02:36.357
You've got a knack.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.760
(thunder rumbles)

02:46.567 --> 02:49.570
(music playing)

03:06.854 --> 03:08.322
WEATHERMAN (on TV):
As this storm continues

03:08.356 --> 03:10.724
to sweep east,
the National Weather Service

03:10.758 --> 03:13.394
has issued severe
weather warnings at this time,

03:13.427 --> 03:15.563
so we're going to continue
to see heavy rainfall

03:15.596 --> 03:17.598
throughout this evening
and into tomorrow.

03:17.631 --> 03:18.932
NEWSMAN (on TV):
Stocks dropped at the opening

03:18.966 --> 03:20.868
as global concerns weigh
on market.

03:20.901 --> 03:24.505
The Dow and the S&P 500 are down
for the second straight day

03:24.538 --> 03:26.240
as United Technology stock
slips eight percent

03:26.274 --> 03:29.009
after their CEO
abruptly resigned...

03:29.042 --> 03:32.613
HENRY: Our Father,
who art in Heaven...

03:32.646 --> 03:36.016
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

03:36.049 --> 03:38.286
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

03:40.087 --> 03:42.890
Give us this day
our daily bread,

03:42.923 --> 03:44.925
and forgive us our trespasses...

03:44.958 --> 03:47.961
(labored breathing)

03:47.995 --> 03:50.631
...as we forgive those...

03:52.633 --> 03:55.102
(rasping)

04:07.748 --> 04:08.982
Daddy?

04:15.523 --> 04:17.090
I have a secret.

04:17.124 --> 04:19.460
(thunder rumbles)

04:19.493 --> 04:20.961
Want to hear it?

04:29.503 --> 04:31.472
(whispering):
Closer.

04:44.518 --> 04:48.989
(demonic voices overlapping
indistinctly)

04:55.295 --> 04:57.030
(thunder crashes)

04:59.199 --> 05:00.968
(man speaking indistinctly
on TV)

05:01.969 --> 05:05.205
ANGELA:
Henry...

05:05.238 --> 05:06.640
what is it?

05:06.674 --> 05:08.742
Is she all right?

05:09.810 --> 05:12.513
Are you okay, Henry?

05:15.649 --> 05:17.418
Wh-What...?

05:33.033 --> 05:36.036
*

06:03.764 --> 06:06.199
(music playing over headphones)

06:11.772 --> 06:15.375
* There's a knock at your door

06:15.409 --> 06:19.413
* You don't even
recognize the stranger *
(loud banging)

06:19.447 --> 06:21.415
* It's you from before

06:23.250 --> 06:27.187
* Trying to warn you
all about the dangers *

06:27.220 --> 06:30.891
* There's a hole in your head

06:30.924 --> 06:34.728
* At least that's what
everybody's guessing *

06:34.762 --> 06:38.732
* It's why you're
always misread *

06:38.766 --> 06:41.902
* Why you sleep
but you never feel rested *

06:41.935 --> 06:43.471
* You never get your rest in

06:43.504 --> 06:44.572
(loud banging continues)

06:44.605 --> 06:46.440
* Hold on to your heart

06:46.474 --> 06:48.208
(banging continues)

06:48.241 --> 06:50.511
(music continues indistinctly)

06:54.615 --> 06:55.949
Case.

06:58.285 --> 07:00.988
Case, can you hear me?

07:01.021 --> 07:02.490
Are you all right?

07:02.523 --> 07:04.825
(violent banging)

07:06.660 --> 07:07.795
* Hold on to your heart

07:07.828 --> 07:09.830
(banging continues)

07:09.863 --> 07:12.666
* Never let nobody...

07:12.700 --> 07:14.334
(bang)

07:14.367 --> 07:15.969
WEATHERMAN (on TV):
Storms will develop

07:16.003 --> 07:17.838
through the late afternoon
and into the evening.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.273
Now, some areas could see
multiple rounds

07:20.307 --> 07:23.343
of heavy downpours,
according to the NWS.

07:23.376 --> 07:26.313
Thunderstorm activity
is expected to continue,

07:26.346 --> 07:28.782
which will trigger
extensive connective showers.

07:28.816 --> 07:31.585
Now, we're going to also see
a drop in temperatures...

07:31.619 --> 07:32.986
(radio drowned out by rain)

07:34.488 --> 07:36.890
(thunder crashes)

07:39.627 --> 07:43.631
Drivers are encouraged to take
alternate routes.

07:43.664 --> 07:46.634
(Gounod's Faust Waltz playing)

07:46.667 --> 07:49.670
*

07:58.345 --> 08:00.147
(heavy thuds)

08:00.180 --> 08:02.382
MARCUS: The Lord Jesus Christ
and His Almighty host,

08:02.415 --> 08:05.452
release this woman!

08:05.485 --> 08:07.588
(praying continues
indistinctly)

08:11.825 --> 08:14.194
(banging, thudding overhead)

08:24.437 --> 08:26.774
(thunder crashing)

08:45.458 --> 08:47.427
MARCUS:
Pray for us.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.997
All holy disciples of the Lord.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.031
TOMAS AND MARCUS:
Pray for us.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.000
All holy innocents.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.401
BOTH:
Pray for us.

08:54.434 --> 08:56.704
St. Stephen...
BOTH: Pray for us.

08:56.737 --> 08:59.773
St. Lawrence...
BOTH:
Pray for us.

08:59.807 --> 09:02.876
St. Vincent...
BOTH: Pray for us.

09:02.910 --> 09:06.246
St. Fabian and Sebastian...
BOTH: Pray for us.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.081
(demonic voice):
Is that all you got, little man?

09:08.115 --> 09:10.083
Saints John and Paul...
Pray for us.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.853
(laughs)
"Pray for us"?

09:12.886 --> 09:14.888
Not exactly El Papa Mexicano.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.256
Wasn't that your
grandfather's wish?

09:16.289 --> 09:18.926
Someday you'll be
the first Mexican pope?

09:18.959 --> 09:19.927
Pray for us.
No.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.394
That was your own invention.

09:21.428 --> 09:22.930
Makes for a better story

09:22.963 --> 09:24.865
at those North Side
cocktail parties.
Pray for us.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.299
But it's still a lie!
(thunder crashes)

09:26.333 --> 09:29.036
I silence you,
unclean spirit!

09:29.069 --> 09:31.504
(speaking Latin)

09:32.405 --> 09:33.641
...Polly Parrot!

09:38.946 --> 09:41.615
Son of the morning,
ashes on the earth,

09:41.649 --> 09:44.584
profane thing
banished from grace.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.553
You are forgiven.

09:46.586 --> 09:50.390
Now leave this body
and be redeemed.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.459
Leave the soul of this child
of God, I command you.

09:52.492 --> 09:54.127
Suffer the little children,
priest,

09:54.161 --> 09:56.063
she's a pig
led to slaughter.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.932
(unearthly screech)
She's a child of God!

09:58.966 --> 10:01.068
She is a bastard spirit
of a jealous despot.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.436
Your God is filth.

10:03.470 --> 10:04.738
Kneel before me.

10:04.772 --> 10:07.007
I am Havoc, I am Despair.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.341
You're nothing,
but a lost, angry soul

10:08.375 --> 10:09.910
throwing a temper tantrum.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.812
You let this young woman go!

10:11.845 --> 10:13.280
(thunder crashes)

10:13.313 --> 10:15.916
(chains rattling)

10:15.949 --> 10:19.119
(bones cracking)

10:19.152 --> 10:20.988
(gasps)

10:21.021 --> 10:22.956
(thunder crashes)

10:25.893 --> 10:28.896
Isn't it wonderful?

10:33.066 --> 10:34.902
(thunder crashes)

10:38.071 --> 10:41.241
Henry, how long
have you been there?

10:43.210 --> 10:45.112
I know, right?

10:45.145 --> 10:46.379
Can you believe it?

10:46.413 --> 10:49.616
It's only been how many years?

10:49.649 --> 10:51.484
Of course,

10:51.518 --> 10:53.687
what I should do is scan them
into the computer.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.889
It would be a lot easier, but...

10:55.923 --> 10:57.357
(banging)

10:57.390 --> 10:59.126
(Tomas speaking indistinctly)

10:59.159 --> 11:00.728
(banging continues)

11:00.761 --> 11:02.863
(indistinct shouting)

11:02.896 --> 11:05.432
I don't know how much more
of this I can take.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.742
What is this?
Hmm?

11:14.775 --> 11:16.676
Oh, wow!

11:16.710 --> 11:18.011
Do you know what this is?

11:18.045 --> 11:21.548
This is your old phone number.

11:21.581 --> 11:23.984
You wrote it on this
the day that we met.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.386
Remember? It was in that...

11:26.419 --> 11:31.058
oh, my God, disgusting
sports bar at LaGuardia.

11:31.091 --> 11:33.693
We had an eight-hour delay,

11:33.727 --> 11:36.163
The Perfect Storm '91.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.564
Please tell me you remember.

11:39.566 --> 11:41.334
(sighs)

11:41.368 --> 11:43.536
Angela, do you believe in God?

11:46.206 --> 11:47.240
What?

11:47.274 --> 11:48.275
Do you believe that our actions

11:48.308 --> 11:50.110
are answerable to consequences

11:50.143 --> 11:51.779
from a higher power?

11:54.114 --> 11:55.682
You know what I think?

11:55.715 --> 11:58.718
I think we both
forgot to eat today.

11:58.752 --> 12:00.954
Low blood sugar.
I mean, between that and the--

12:00.988 --> 12:04.357
and the weather and...
what's going on upstairs.

12:04.391 --> 12:07.761
You know, y-you need to be
responsible for yourself.

12:07.795 --> 12:09.930
It can't always be on me.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.233
Have you ever lied to me?

12:13.266 --> 12:14.802
Henry.

12:19.306 --> 12:20.473
Have you ever
lied to me?

12:20.507 --> 12:22.109
I heard you.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.377
You know what I could use
right now, Henry,

12:24.411 --> 12:26.246
is a little cooperation.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.881
Is that too much to ask for?

12:27.915 --> 12:30.717
I mean, what is this?
What are you saying?

12:30.750 --> 12:33.520
(demonic laughter)
'Cause if you're implying
that I...

12:35.622 --> 12:37.290
Are you saying this is my fault?

12:37.324 --> 12:39.259
Is that what you're saying?

12:39.292 --> 12:40.994
How?

12:41.028 --> 12:43.897
How am I to blame for this,
Henry?

12:43.931 --> 12:45.265
No.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.468
No.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.573
You have to fight this, Casey.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.641
(humming in woman's voice)

12:54.674 --> 12:56.143
I know you don't feel
strong enough,

12:56.176 --> 12:57.077
but that's what
we're here for--

12:57.110 --> 13:00.413
to help you fight.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.817
(humming)

13:10.123 --> 13:12.725
(woman speaking Spanish)

13:33.847 --> 13:34.681
Don't look at it.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.688
Don't let it in your head.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.029
(humming resumes)

13:49.062 --> 13:50.330
Tomas!

13:53.166 --> 13:54.134
Tomas...

13:54.167 --> 13:55.202
Depart this place, demon.

13:56.236 --> 13:59.606
I co-- I command you!

14:02.042 --> 14:04.044
(gasping)

14:13.921 --> 14:15.722
(exhales deeply)

14:15.755 --> 14:17.357
I know. I know.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.659
You can do this.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.194
But the way it takes love--

14:21.228 --> 14:22.996
it finds it,

14:23.030 --> 14:26.366
you can feel it sniffing
for it-- and twists it.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.568
That's what it's doing
to Casey's soul.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.037
(sighs deeply)

14:30.070 --> 14:31.571
(Casey screaming)

14:36.910 --> 14:39.146
(demonic voice): This little
piggy goes to market,

14:40.080 --> 14:43.250
this little piggy stays home,

14:43.283 --> 14:44.384
this little piggy goes...

14:44.417 --> 14:45.785
(growling)

14:45.818 --> 14:47.787
(shrieking)

14:49.622 --> 14:52.125
(Marcus grunting)
(growling)

14:52.159 --> 14:55.195
Till she gives me
her rancid little soul.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.563
(guttural shrieking)

15:05.672 --> 15:09.142
(chains rattling)

15:19.352 --> 15:22.889
HENRY: Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.724
Blessed art thou amongst women,

15:24.757 --> 15:27.227
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.429
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

15:29.462 --> 15:31.364
now and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.301
(thunder crashes)

15:47.947 --> 15:49.983
(door creaking)

15:50.017 --> 15:53.853
(dripping)

15:53.886 --> 15:55.822
Oh...

15:55.855 --> 15:58.691
Oh, man.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.066
Come on!

16:11.571 --> 16:12.572
(sighs)

16:16.809 --> 16:17.810
Ah.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.041
(chuckles)

16:52.745 --> 16:54.747
(dripping continues)

17:03.123 --> 17:04.491
(Casey moaning softly)

17:04.524 --> 17:07.427
(Marcus whispering indistinctly)

17:07.460 --> 17:09.362
(Casey moans)

17:12.632 --> 17:15.235
Shh...
(whimpering)

17:15.268 --> 17:17.170
SALESMAN:
Why are you fighting me?

17:17.204 --> 17:20.039
(Casey whimpers)

17:20.073 --> 17:22.442
Do you know what it is

17:22.475 --> 17:25.878
to have paradise
within your reach?

17:25.912 --> 17:29.116
Never be allowed to touch it?

17:29.149 --> 17:30.417
Imagine

17:30.450 --> 17:32.852
never sleeping again or eating,

17:32.885 --> 17:35.255
feeling the sun on your face.

17:38.425 --> 17:39.926
(normal voice):
Why?

17:39.959 --> 17:42.962
Why me? Please.

17:42.995 --> 17:44.697
What do you want from me?

17:44.731 --> 17:46.766
Quit pretending.

17:46.799 --> 17:49.736
You know perfectly well
what you must do.

17:49.769 --> 17:52.439
Bring her to me!

17:53.306 --> 17:54.974
(cries)

17:55.007 --> 17:57.944
(skin sizzling)

17:57.977 --> 17:59.879
(gasping)

17:59.912 --> 18:01.148
(whispering indistinctly)

18:01.181 --> 18:05.552
Amen. Shh...
(whimpering)

18:05.585 --> 18:07.086
In the name of Jesus...

18:07.120 --> 18:09.156
You've got to stop this, Mom.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.157
(thunder crashes)

18:10.190 --> 18:11.224
Are you listening to me?

18:11.258 --> 18:12.492
How could you just sit there?

18:12.525 --> 18:13.893
Kat, we're doing
everything we can.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.462
I think we should
call the cops.

18:15.495 --> 18:16.463
No.

18:16.496 --> 18:17.564
Have you even been up there?
Sweetie.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.732
Why won't they let me see her?

18:19.766 --> 18:21.734
Why the hell did you let them
discharge her from the hospital?

18:21.768 --> 18:23.836
At least there,
she had doctors.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.438
Kat, please don't yell at me.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.640
I don't think I can handle it.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.312
Look,

18:32.345 --> 18:35.014
I don't know what's wrong
with her any more than you do.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.450
But what Casey needs right now
is professional care.

18:37.484 --> 18:40.052
Hey, look.
Look at this.

18:42.054 --> 18:43.323
Look what I found.

18:50.563 --> 18:53.032
I think when people
obsess about the past,

18:53.065 --> 18:55.868
it's because they're
afraid of the future.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.370
We can't be afraid.

18:57.404 --> 18:58.971
We just have to
do the right thing.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.640
But how do you know
what's right?

19:00.673 --> 19:01.708
(thunder crashes)

19:01.741 --> 19:02.875
Is she...?

19:02.909 --> 19:04.977
Sleeping.

19:05.011 --> 19:06.846
(sighs)

19:06.879 --> 19:09.048
Would you care for a cup of tea?

19:09.081 --> 19:10.917
Oh, that would be a blessing.

19:17.924 --> 19:21.461
I wish I'd had an older sister
like you growing up.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.995
Would have saved me
a world of trouble.

19:24.063 --> 19:27.166
Do you really think
you're helping?

19:27.200 --> 19:30.937
If you believe nothing else,
Kat, believe this.

19:31.938 --> 19:35.041
I would never hurt Casey.

19:45.585 --> 19:46.653
(thunder crashes)

19:46.686 --> 19:48.421
Oh.

19:48.455 --> 19:49.889
(knocking)
(sighing)

19:49.922 --> 19:51.591
One minute.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.094
(knocking forcefully)
Yes?

19:55.127 --> 19:57.029
JESSICA:
Tomas, come here.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.533
Jessica?

20:05.972 --> 20:07.974
(door creaks)

20:10.710 --> 20:12.879
JESSICA: Tomas?

20:18.618 --> 20:20.987
Tomas, come to me.

20:37.103 --> 20:38.805
Tomas?

20:38.838 --> 20:41.374
You're not Jessica.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.643
Then who am I?

20:43.676 --> 20:45.378
(praying quickly in Spanish)

20:45.412 --> 20:46.479
Tomas?

20:46.513 --> 20:48.381
Look at me.

20:48.415 --> 20:49.449
(praying quietly in Spanish)

20:50.483 --> 20:51.651
What is it about me

20:51.684 --> 20:54.120
that scares you so much?

20:54.153 --> 20:56.756
(speaking Spanish)

20:56.789 --> 20:59.058
You're not Jessica.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.227
Tell me.
Don't tell God.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.596
I'm right here.

21:03.630 --> 21:06.799
Is it the fear
of losing yourself?

21:07.800 --> 21:09.736
Letting yourself

21:09.769 --> 21:11.771
love and be loved

21:11.804 --> 21:13.440
for once.

21:15.542 --> 21:17.610
(whispering):
You're a married woman.

21:17.644 --> 21:20.813
Only in the eyes of God.

21:20.847 --> 21:24.984
With my eyes,
you could see much more.

21:27.219 --> 21:29.522
Give me your hands.

21:29.556 --> 21:31.424
Unclean...

21:31.458 --> 21:32.692
spirit.

21:32.725 --> 21:35.161
Unclean?

21:50.242 --> 21:51.544
(whispering):
Stop it.

21:51.578 --> 21:53.713
I thought you liked
the way I smell.

21:53.746 --> 21:55.982
Go on.

21:56.015 --> 21:57.650
Doesn't Christ preach

21:57.684 --> 21:58.818
to feed the hungry?

22:00.720 --> 22:04.056
(whispering):
And I am so hungry, Tomas.

22:05.091 --> 22:07.259
So hungry.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.330
It's time
for you to pray.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.612
(demonic voice):
I will make you forget God.

22:28.681 --> 22:31.083
(thunder rumbles)

22:32.952 --> 22:36.556
(Tomas moaning)

22:40.126 --> 22:42.261
Tomas!

22:42.294 --> 22:44.096
(demonic voice):
Just as I was getting ahead.

22:44.130 --> 22:45.432
(Marcus grunts)

22:49.402 --> 22:52.071
That's more like it.

22:55.808 --> 22:57.276
Marcus, listen.

22:57.309 --> 22:58.845
Oh, no, no, no, you are
not gonna rationalize this.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.713
You let that thing
in there compromise you.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.114
You're useless to me now.

23:02.148 --> 23:04.417
Wait! Tell me you've
never made a mistake.

23:04.451 --> 23:06.586
Oh, I've made plenty.

23:06.619 --> 23:08.455
Just so happens
this one's yours.

23:08.488 --> 23:10.990
You're a liability, understand?

23:15.728 --> 23:16.629
Casey?

23:16.663 --> 23:17.764
(normal voice):
Help me, Kat,

23:17.797 --> 23:19.131
they're torturing me.

23:19.165 --> 23:20.399
MARCUS:
Where do you
think you're going?

23:20.433 --> 23:22.201
Get the hell away from there!

23:22.234 --> 23:24.136
Casey!

23:24.170 --> 23:26.172
Casey!

23:46.425 --> 23:48.528
(thunder rumbles)

24:15.555 --> 24:17.757
(demonic voice): What an
excellent day for an exorcism.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.091
What is your name, demon?

24:19.125 --> 24:20.092
What do you want?

24:20.126 --> 24:23.996
You... with us.

24:24.030 --> 24:26.198
An excommunicated priest

24:26.232 --> 24:29.001
would make quite the jewel
in our crown.

24:29.035 --> 24:30.369
Then why torture Casey?

24:30.402 --> 24:32.104
You can have her.

24:32.138 --> 24:35.141
Though I didn't think
that girls were your flavor.

24:35.174 --> 24:36.543
You're a coward...

24:36.576 --> 24:38.144
hiding behind a young woman.

24:38.177 --> 24:40.012
You're not fit to say grace,

24:40.046 --> 24:42.882
let alone perform an exorcism.

24:44.416 --> 24:46.318
(male voice with Scouse accent):
I always knew

24:46.352 --> 24:49.889
you'd be a failure, boy.

24:49.922 --> 24:51.791
Very clever.

24:51.824 --> 24:55.294
(demonic voice):
He's very disappointed in you,
your dad.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.129
If you know him...

24:57.163 --> 24:59.131
then you know
what happened to him.

24:59.165 --> 25:01.200
(speaks French)

25:03.369 --> 25:06.072
Is it her innocence
that excites you?

25:06.105 --> 25:09.542
You think she's weak
'cause she's a woman?

25:09.576 --> 25:10.677
Pick on someone

25:10.710 --> 25:12.211
your own size.

25:12.244 --> 25:13.880
When I get what I want.

25:13.913 --> 25:14.914
What do you want?

25:14.947 --> 25:17.817
Bring her to me.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.018
Who?

25:19.051 --> 25:22.689
Face your failures, priest.

25:22.722 --> 25:26.492
What's another soul rotting
in the dust of humanity?

25:26.525 --> 25:30.029
All this 'cause God
turned his back on you,

25:30.062 --> 25:33.365
you spiteful,
jealous spirit.

25:33.399 --> 25:35.534
Be gone!
(groans)

25:35.568 --> 25:38.537
She doesn't want you.

25:38.571 --> 25:40.372
Can't you feel her fighting?

25:40.406 --> 25:42.241
The force of God's love

25:42.274 --> 25:44.076
will cast you out,
fallen angel.

25:44.110 --> 25:47.947
You let the blood of Christ
redeem you.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.081
(snarls)

25:50.249 --> 25:52.084
What do you know of love?

25:52.118 --> 25:54.921
You let the blood
of Christ redeem you.

25:56.656 --> 25:59.025
(female with Irish accent):
Only the good can be loved.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.327
Isn't that
right, dear?

26:04.296 --> 26:06.666
Mum?

26:11.003 --> 26:13.305
Jim's in Houston on business.

26:13.339 --> 26:14.807
I was out.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.449
MUM:
You know I was

26:23.482 --> 26:27.319
never one for sentiment
or feeling, son.

26:27.353 --> 26:29.488
But I need you
to know this.

26:31.157 --> 26:33.793
Your father and I...

26:35.928 --> 26:39.598
...it were a hard life.

26:39.632 --> 26:41.067
It was a good one...

26:41.100 --> 26:44.103
all things considered...

26:45.604 --> 26:49.441
...up until you come along.

26:49.475 --> 26:50.977
You was a mistake...

26:51.010 --> 26:53.680
son.

26:53.713 --> 26:57.116
You was never
supposed to happen.

26:57.149 --> 26:59.819
Don't say that.

27:03.189 --> 27:06.759
MUM:
Cost your father his pension.

27:06.793 --> 27:11.163
Bet you didn't know that, huh?

27:13.199 --> 27:18.905
Probably why he brained me
with that hammer of his.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.511
(both moaning)

27:25.544 --> 27:28.080
MUM:
You took our lives away.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.619
Marcus.

27:33.652 --> 27:37.724
Should have flushed you
when I had the chance.

27:41.060 --> 27:42.228
DAD:
Go on, lad.

27:42.261 --> 27:44.230
What are you waiting for?

27:44.263 --> 27:48.234
Kill the little bitch
like I done your useless mum.

27:51.771 --> 27:54.707
Is that all you've got?

27:57.043 --> 27:59.812
(moaning)

27:59.846 --> 28:01.513
That which fell among
thorns are they,

28:01.547 --> 28:02.749
which, when they have
heard, go forth,

28:02.782 --> 28:04.516
and are choked with the
cares of this world.

28:04.550 --> 28:05.718
For there is nothing secret
Damned are the meek,

28:05.752 --> 28:07.319
that shall not be made manifest,
for they are as lambs

28:07.353 --> 28:08.687
nor hid that shall not
led to slaughter.

28:08.721 --> 28:09.889
be known and
come to light!

28:09.922 --> 28:12.458
Give over, Marcus.
Come to us.

28:13.760 --> 28:16.262
(heavy breathing)

28:16.295 --> 28:17.596
MARCUS:
I cast you and I order

28:17.629 --> 28:19.265
into the light,
unclean spirit.

28:20.132 --> 28:21.100
Leave this servant

28:21.133 --> 28:22.101
of God!

28:22.134 --> 28:23.369
(unnatural shrieking)

28:33.645 --> 28:36.615
(sirens wailing)

28:38.417 --> 28:40.519
No.

28:40.552 --> 28:41.888
No.
Mom.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.622
No. No, no!
Mom, no.

28:43.655 --> 28:46.392
Mom, this is
for Casey's own good!

28:46.425 --> 28:48.427
Casey?

28:49.461 --> 28:50.529
Take my hand, Casey,

28:50.562 --> 28:52.398
I'm right here.

28:52.431 --> 28:54.133
(loud banging on door)
OFFICER: Police!

28:54.166 --> 28:55.734
Up the stairs.
Let us go, ma'am.
ANGELA: Please!

28:55.768 --> 28:56.735
They're coming!

28:56.769 --> 28:58.971
The police are coming!

28:59.005 --> 29:00.739
MARCUS: Casey...
ANGELA: No!

29:00.773 --> 29:01.974
OFFICER: Yes.
ANGELA: No, you
don't understand.

29:02.008 --> 29:03.375
OFFICER 2:
Get out of the way!

29:03.409 --> 29:06.078
Ipse venit.

29:06.112 --> 29:08.247
(grunts)

29:08.280 --> 29:09.381
(groans)

29:09.415 --> 29:10.582
No, no!

29:10.616 --> 29:11.617
No!

29:11.650 --> 29:13.485
(Marcus grunting)

29:13.519 --> 29:14.954
ANGELA:
You can't interrupt it.

29:14.987 --> 29:16.923
Get off me.

29:16.956 --> 29:18.757
Let go of me. Casey!
KAT: Mom.

29:18.791 --> 29:20.459
ANGELA: Casey!
KAT: Mom, this is
for her own good.

29:20.492 --> 29:22.628
ANGELA:
You can't!

29:28.935 --> 29:30.636
OFFICER:
Please, clear the hallway.

29:30.669 --> 29:32.404
OFFICER 2: We've got to get
in here, ma'am, please.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.807
ANGELA:
What are you doing?

29:34.841 --> 29:36.675
No! No!

29:36.708 --> 29:39.011
No, you don't understand.
OFFICER: Back here, please.

29:39.045 --> 29:41.113
The man is a priest.
No, no, no, come on.

29:41.147 --> 29:42.148
ANGELA:
You can't stop this.

29:42.181 --> 29:43.515
Don't! No!

29:43.549 --> 29:45.084
Let go of me! Let go!

29:45.117 --> 29:46.752
Casey!
Mom, Mom, please.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.420
Please, this is
for her own good.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.422
ANGELA:
Let me go! You can't!

29:50.456 --> 29:51.958
You'll kill her.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.692
You can't take her.

29:53.725 --> 29:54.827
You'll kill her.

29:54.861 --> 29:55.928
Get your hands off me...

29:55.962 --> 29:57.263
KAT: Mom,
Mom, please.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.597
Please, it's for
her own good.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.933
OFFICER: Can we clear
the hallway, please?

30:00.967 --> 30:04.470
(speaking indistinctly)

30:04.503 --> 30:06.906
(indistinct radio transmission)

30:21.687 --> 30:24.090
*

30:45.744 --> 30:48.180
(siren wailing)

30:54.453 --> 30:56.055
Mr. and Mrs. Rance,
I know this is

30:56.088 --> 30:58.057
a very difficult moment
for you.

30:58.090 --> 31:01.027
Please know that everyone here
is here for you.

31:01.060 --> 31:03.695
If there's anything that
we can do, you just let us know.

31:03.729 --> 31:05.497
*

31:05.531 --> 31:08.901
Your daughter's on the way
to the hospital.

31:08.935 --> 31:11.971
She's gonna receive
the very best care available.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.909
But we're really
gonna need to talk

31:16.943 --> 31:18.544
about what happened
here tonight,

31:18.577 --> 31:20.412
Mr. and Mrs. Rance.

31:24.984 --> 31:27.954
MAN (over radio):
724, this is dispatch, over.

31:33.759 --> 31:36.662
724, this is dispatch, come in.
(heavy rattling)

31:38.830 --> 31:41.567
(men screaming)

31:47.273 --> 31:49.641
(snarling)

32:03.255 --> 32:05.424
REPORTER: Breaking news now,
the Andersonville family

32:05.457 --> 32:07.759
of a missing young woman
is fearing the worst

32:07.793 --> 32:10.829
this evening after her
disappearance two nights ago

32:10.862 --> 32:12.664
after a deadly ambulance crash.

32:12.698 --> 32:15.834
Casey Rance was being
transported to a local hospital

32:15.867 --> 32:19.471
when her ambulance suffered
a bizarre and deadly crash.

32:19.505 --> 32:21.840
Authorities have declined
to state the nature

32:21.873 --> 32:23.942
of Miss Rance's
underlying illness,

32:23.976 --> 32:26.012
but they have issued
every assurance

32:26.045 --> 32:27.513
that she will be found.

32:27.546 --> 32:29.815
As police superintendent
and as a father

32:29.848 --> 32:33.152
with children of my own, I can
guarantee no one here will rest

32:33.185 --> 32:35.821
until Casey is safely brought
home to her family.

32:37.056 --> 32:39.525
Ipse venit.

32:41.693 --> 32:44.596
Ipse venit...

32:44.630 --> 32:46.932
Himself...

32:46.965 --> 32:49.335
is coming.

32:52.204 --> 32:54.040
He...

32:54.073 --> 32:56.508
is coming.

32:57.843 --> 32:59.245
(door buzzes, keys jingle)

33:02.748 --> 33:05.151
What am I gonna do with you?

33:05.184 --> 33:07.386
You need to warn His Holiness.

33:18.697 --> 33:21.100
(shudders)

33:27.173 --> 33:29.341
Casey!

33:29.375 --> 33:32.278
(panting)

33:34.713 --> 33:36.682
Henry?

33:39.718 --> 33:43.255
Sweetie, what is it?

33:43.289 --> 33:47.259
Angela, is there something
you need to tell me?

33:52.098 --> 33:54.032
I'm sorry.

33:54.066 --> 33:57.669
I've been very
selfish lately.

33:57.703 --> 34:00.906
I haven't really
let you in, have I?

34:05.144 --> 34:08.380
Henry, if you won't talk to me,

34:08.414 --> 34:10.782
if you won't tell me
what's troubling you,

34:10.816 --> 34:11.883
how am I supposed...?

34:17.256 --> 34:19.625
You need to confess.

34:22.428 --> 34:24.430
*

34:32.938 --> 34:35.107
(inhales, exhales)

34:37.075 --> 34:39.077
(doors open)

34:48.687 --> 34:50.656
(doors close)

34:59.965 --> 35:01.967
(whispering in Spanish)

35:21.787 --> 35:23.855
(doors open)

35:25.056 --> 35:27.058
Hello?

35:46.912 --> 35:49.014
ANGELA:
St. Anthony.

35:50.048 --> 35:52.484
He was the patron saint of...

35:52.518 --> 35:54.019
Uh... lost things.

35:54.052 --> 35:56.222
I thought that
was St. Jude.

35:56.255 --> 35:58.557
No, St. Jude
is lost causes.

35:58.590 --> 36:00.158
So how can you tell

36:00.192 --> 36:02.794
when something
stops being lost

36:02.828 --> 36:04.830
and starts being
a lost cause?

36:08.734 --> 36:11.102
We're going to find Casey.

36:13.705 --> 36:15.841
People don't just disappear.

36:15.874 --> 36:18.009
Well...

36:18.043 --> 36:20.379
that's the problem, isn't it?

36:20.412 --> 36:22.848
She was disappearing...

36:22.881 --> 36:24.883
before she was ever lost.

36:25.884 --> 36:28.254
Henry's illness.

36:28.287 --> 36:30.922
Kat's accident.

36:30.956 --> 36:33.359
Casey...

36:36.061 --> 36:37.263
Why did you

36:37.296 --> 36:38.864
become a priest, father?

36:38.897 --> 36:41.433
Was... was there...?

36:41.467 --> 36:44.336
Your grandmother.

36:44.370 --> 36:46.272
That's right.

36:46.305 --> 36:48.073
El Papa Mexicano.

36:49.275 --> 36:51.243
I love that story.

36:53.312 --> 36:56.047
Yes, um...

36:56.081 --> 36:59.918
(clicks tongue)
...a story.

36:59.951 --> 37:02.754
My parents split up

37:02.788 --> 37:05.791
when I was quite young.

37:07.058 --> 37:09.795
My father, never
saw much of him.

37:09.828 --> 37:11.630
So I lived with my mom.

37:11.663 --> 37:13.299
My friends were mostly...

37:13.332 --> 37:16.067
well, her friends, adults.

37:16.101 --> 37:18.537
(inhales) Always
moving, always

37:18.570 --> 37:20.972
changing schools.

37:22.841 --> 37:25.777
It was when we lived
in D.C. that...

37:28.780 --> 37:32.418
they called it
a nervous breakdown.

37:32.451 --> 37:34.820
Except it wasn't a breakdown.

37:37.122 --> 37:39.124
You know how sometimes kids

37:39.157 --> 37:41.627
have an imaginary friend?

37:41.660 --> 37:44.563
I had one.

37:44.596 --> 37:47.299
To me, he looked like a...

37:47.333 --> 37:50.001
little red bird.

37:50.035 --> 37:52.771
He could do just about anything.

37:52.804 --> 37:54.906
Correction.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.409
He could make me do...

37:57.443 --> 38:00.211
just about anything.

38:01.847 --> 38:04.215
At first...

38:06.151 --> 38:08.654
...he made me feel special.

38:08.687 --> 38:09.721
Then...

38:10.989 --> 38:13.492
I can't remember most of it.

38:13.525 --> 38:15.761
Thankfully.

38:15.794 --> 38:18.864
Post-traumatic amnesia,
it's called.

38:18.897 --> 38:22.501
Afterwards, I just wanted
to move on with my life,

38:22.534 --> 38:24.703
put it behind me.

38:24.736 --> 38:27.105
But my mother,

38:27.138 --> 38:29.675
she was always finding new ways

38:29.708 --> 38:33.011
to use my story to make a buck.

38:33.044 --> 38:36.081
"This is the path God gave us,
sweetie, use it."

38:37.549 --> 38:40.452
But I... I ran away
from all that.

38:40.486 --> 38:42.854
Changed my name.

38:42.888 --> 38:44.556
I never told her

38:44.590 --> 38:46.224
where I went.

38:46.257 --> 38:48.760
I never saw her again.

38:50.028 --> 38:51.997
I...

38:52.030 --> 38:54.500
I reinvented myself.

38:54.533 --> 38:56.535
But it didn't matter.

38:58.003 --> 39:01.206
No matter what I did,

39:01.239 --> 39:03.375
I chose

39:03.409 --> 39:04.510
Angela.

39:04.543 --> 39:06.412
(chuckles softly)
Angela.

39:06.445 --> 39:07.646
(doorbell rings)

39:07.679 --> 39:10.081
Like a name would protect me.

39:12.050 --> 39:14.085
That I dreamed

39:14.119 --> 39:17.656
I could have a life,

39:17.689 --> 39:20.025
a chance.

39:21.226 --> 39:23.762
Didn't matter.

39:25.030 --> 39:27.433
It wasn't done with me.

39:27.466 --> 39:31.202
It's coming for me,
Father, I know it.

39:33.371 --> 39:36.475
My name is Regan MacNeil.

39:39.445 --> 39:42.213
I'm Chris MacNeil.

39:42.247 --> 39:44.616
I've come to see my daughter.
