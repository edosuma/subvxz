<i>K.</i>

00:37.000 --> 00:38.041
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

00:38.833 --> 00:41.500
<i>I read your diary
because of the copyright.</i>

00:42.166 --> 00:43.666
<i>But through your diary,</i>

00:44.666 --> 00:45.625
<i>I found out</i>

00:46.541 --> 00:49.625
<i>how much you've sacrificed for love.</i>

00:52.041 --> 00:53.458
<i>Losing the person you love the most.</i>

00:54.541 --> 00:56.458
<i>After that heartbreaking pain,</i>

00:57.666 --> 00:59.916
<i>how long will it take to calm down?</i>

01:01.666 --> 01:03.791
<i>I want to be by her side</i>

01:05.000 --> 01:07.416
<i>and walk through this pain with her.</i>

01:08.208 --> 01:10.250
<i>But I don't know if I'm worthy</i>

01:11.500 --> 01:12.916
<i>of doing something for her.</i>

01:13.000 --> 01:13.833
CHANG CHE-KAI

01:13.916 --> 01:15.666
I'M SORRY.
I READ YOUR DIARY BECAUSE…

01:15.750 --> 01:17.541
<i>Why does my heart hurt so much</i>

01:18.250 --> 01:20.250
<i>when I see her cry?</i>

01:45.291 --> 01:47.416
IF YOU LOVE HER, JUST TELL HER.
DON'T HAVE ANY REGRETS.

CHANG CHE-KAI, AT PINGTUNG KENTING

02:11.750 --> 02:12.583
<i>Hello?</i>

02:12.666 --> 02:13.708
Hello, Pang.

02:13.791 --> 02:17.541
Do you know
where Cream's grave or ashes is?

02:17.625 --> 02:20.375
<i>I don't think she has a grave.</i>

02:20.458 --> 02:21.666
What do you mean?

02:21.750 --> 02:24.375
<i>Three years ago,
Cream threw herself into the sea.</i>

02:25.000 --> 02:26.333
<i>No body was found.</i>

02:26.416 --> 02:27.708
<i>There was no funeral either.</i>

02:27.791 --> 02:29.041
No body was found?

02:29.125 --> 02:30.708
How did you know she committed suicide?

02:31.833 --> 02:33.250
<i>That time,</i>

02:33.333 --> 02:34.875
<i>Bonnie got a phone call.</i>

02:34.958 --> 02:37.208
<i>She went to the south
in the middle of the night.</i>

02:37.291 --> 02:38.500
<i>When Bonnie came back,</i>

02:38.583 --> 02:41.291
<i>she said that Cream went away with K.</i>

02:41.375 --> 02:43.541
Why wait three years to give it to us?

02:44.291 --> 02:46.625
<i>Anyway, you're the producer of A-Lin now.</i>

02:46.708 --> 02:51.125
<i>So please let A-Lin
record this song right away.</i>

02:51.208 --> 02:57.916
CREAM&K

02:59.875 --> 03:01.250
Cream is still alive.

03:01.333 --> 03:02.583
Why did you tell people she's dead?

03:02.666 --> 03:04.791
I'm also a victim, okay?

03:04.875 --> 03:06.250
Do you know how I feel?

03:06.333 --> 03:08.166
I was deceived by a person
sleeping next to me.

03:08.833 --> 03:09.833
It feels uncomfortable.

03:13.291 --> 03:15.291
I wanted to tell you,

03:15.375 --> 03:16.958
but Cream wouldn't let me tell you.

03:17.041 --> 03:18.958
She doesn't want to show herself.

03:23.083 --> 03:26.458
<i>That day, someone found Cream drowning
at the beach.</i>

03:27.541 --> 03:30.250
<i>Although she was lucky enough
to be rescued,</i>

03:30.333 --> 03:32.250
<i>at that time,</i>

03:33.083 --> 03:35.250
<i>she didn't even have the will to live.</i>

04:11.166 --> 04:12.291
Bonnie.

04:15.208 --> 04:17.000
You're so stupid!

04:17.083 --> 04:18.541
Do you know how worried I was

04:18.625 --> 04:19.708
when I got the call?

04:19.791 --> 04:21.500
If someone didn't walk by and save you,

04:21.583 --> 04:23.666
you would've died, you know?

04:28.916 --> 04:30.000
Bonnie.

04:32.291 --> 04:33.625
I can't find him.

04:39.708 --> 04:42.083
I know that you want to find K.

04:43.500 --> 04:44.666
But think about it.

04:44.750 --> 04:46.500
Do you think K will be happy

04:47.166 --> 04:48.625
to see you like this?

04:50.875 --> 04:52.291
But Bonnie,

04:53.000 --> 04:54.375
what should I do?

04:54.458 --> 04:55.541
What should I do?

04:55.625 --> 04:56.958
I can't find him.

04:58.958 --> 05:01.000
Will he be scared?

05:02.208 --> 05:03.416
He's alone.

05:04.125 --> 05:05.250
What can he do?

05:05.750 --> 05:07.000
What can he do?

05:07.083 --> 05:08.500
Cream.

05:08.583 --> 05:10.041
Let me ask you,

05:10.916 --> 05:12.625
if you go away with K,

05:13.166 --> 05:15.916
what will happen to K's song?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.750
Didn't you say

05:17.833 --> 05:19.541
that you'll write the lyrics for him

05:19.625 --> 05:21.458
and finish the song?

05:22.125 --> 05:24.500
You can't just leave like this.

05:39.750 --> 05:41.000
Cream.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.333
I am with you.

05:45.500 --> 05:48.833
Let's finish this song for K.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.041
Okay?

05:56.666 --> 05:59.791
<i>Although Cream was saved three years ago,</i>

05:59.875 --> 06:01.750
she's as good as dead.

06:01.833 --> 06:04.291
If it weren't for K's song,

06:04.375 --> 06:05.916
she'd never last for so long.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.375
But didn't Cream marry Yang Yu-hsien?

06:09.250 --> 06:10.541
Why did she

06:10.625 --> 06:12.375
try to kill herself to follow K?

06:15.958 --> 06:17.166
Since the beginning,

06:17.250 --> 06:19.416
Cream has only loved one person.

06:20.791 --> 06:22.458
7 DAYS UNTIL THE EXAM

06:24.916 --> 06:26.708
<i>Every decision that Cream has made,</i>

06:26.791 --> 06:28.500
<i>K was always the reason behind them.</i>

06:30.375 --> 06:31.791
<i>Wherever K went,</i>

06:31.875 --> 06:33.958
<i>all Cream wanted to do was follow him.</i>

06:34.708 --> 06:36.625
I like you, Sung Yuan-yuan.

06:36.708 --> 06:37.750
I'm sorry.

06:37.833 --> 06:39.208
There's someone I like.

06:39.291 --> 06:40.833
Is it Chang Che-kai?

06:42.916 --> 06:44.916
Why are you wasting your time
waiting for him?

06:45.000 --> 06:46.708
If he had liked you,

06:46.791 --> 06:48.291
you would've already been together.

06:49.166 --> 06:50.500
I bought this for you.

06:50.583 --> 06:51.875
Just take it.

06:55.833 --> 06:58.708
<i>Cream rejected every suitor</i>

06:58.791 --> 07:00.291
<i>just for K.</i>

07:00.375 --> 07:01.375
Hey!

07:06.125 --> 07:08.541
<i>Every moment with K</i>

07:08.625 --> 07:11.041
<i>was the happiest time for Cream.</i>

07:11.750 --> 07:15.333
-This is expensive. The seller…
<i>-She believed that one day,</i>

07:15.416 --> 07:17.166
<i>K will confess his love to her.</i>

07:19.500 --> 07:20.375
<i>But</i>

07:21.666 --> 07:22.708
<i>she didn't expect…</i>

07:29.583 --> 07:30.500
Hey.

07:32.291 --> 07:34.041
In the end, we didn't get to see

07:34.125 --> 07:36.166
that beach you said was beautiful.

07:37.041 --> 07:38.958
Let's go again this weekend, okay?

07:39.708 --> 07:40.583
There's no need.

07:41.208 --> 07:42.375
Let's not spend time on that.

07:47.583 --> 07:49.916
<i>K has never been this cold to Cream.</i>

07:51.208 --> 07:53.041
<i>From then on,</i>

07:53.875 --> 07:56.000
<i>Cream had a strange feeling.</i>

07:56.083 --> 07:57.666
Stupid K.

07:58.333 --> 08:00.208
<i>That day, after Cream had a fight with me,</i>

08:00.291 --> 08:01.250
I'll change it for you.

08:01.333 --> 08:03.416
<i>-she found out the truth.</i>
-What are you doing, Rookie?

08:04.125 --> 08:07.541
Psycho, asshole, bastard…

08:07.625 --> 08:09.208
Isn't she ashamed of dressing like that?

08:09.291 --> 08:10.333
I'm a rookie songwriter?

08:10.416 --> 08:11.458
You're Hello Kitty.

08:14.625 --> 08:15.625
You're not a Catgirl.

08:15.708 --> 08:16.833
You're the devil!

08:22.791 --> 08:25.625
What do Catgirl's fans like?

08:27.250 --> 08:29.125
Why didn't K's songs get rejected?

08:36.291 --> 08:39.125
Ding-dong. Anybody home?

09:14.875 --> 09:17.416
Who puts vitamins in their closet?

09:24.458 --> 09:26.625
CHANG CHE-KAI

09:29.291 --> 09:33.041
PATIENT WITH
CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA

09:44.958 --> 09:46.166
<i>This is Gleevec.</i>

09:46.250 --> 09:49.833
<i>It's for people with cancer or leukemia.</i>

10:00.041 --> 10:01.875
<i>Yuan-yuan, we're leaving.</i>

10:01.958 --> 10:03.583
<i>Bye, we'll be back soon.</i>

10:03.666 --> 10:05.041
<i>Yuan-yuan, we're leaving.</i>

10:25.166 --> 10:26.166
Why?

10:28.708 --> 10:29.916
Why?

10:34.458 --> 10:35.625
No!

10:36.125 --> 10:37.250
Wait.

10:37.333 --> 10:38.291
No.

10:38.375 --> 10:39.833
Wait!

10:39.916 --> 10:41.541
Why are you leaving?

10:41.625 --> 10:42.916
How can you leave me?

10:43.000 --> 10:44.791
No!

10:44.875 --> 10:45.708
Why?

10:45.791 --> 10:47.500
Why are you leaving?

10:47.583 --> 10:50.333
Wait! Please wait!

11:05.500 --> 11:06.625
I'm home.

11:13.541 --> 11:16.041
Ding-dong, is anyone home?

11:30.041 --> 11:30.916
<i>But…</i>

11:31.000 --> 11:33.541
Why didn't you tell him
that you already knew?

11:34.750 --> 11:36.416
Let's say

11:36.500 --> 11:39.833
he only has 100 days to live.

11:41.375 --> 11:43.000
If I tell him,

11:43.791 --> 11:46.083
would it change from 100 to 101 days?

11:47.625 --> 11:51.000
Then you should be together all the more.

11:53.666 --> 11:57.250
<i>That day, I tried to test him.</i>

11:58.541 --> 12:00.791
I hope that

12:01.458 --> 12:02.791
you'll find a good man

12:03.583 --> 12:04.750
and get married soon.

12:05.541 --> 12:08.416
<i>I knew he didn't really mean it.</i>

12:10.750 --> 12:12.125
You can marry me then.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.750
<i>At that moment,</i>

12:15.458 --> 12:18.250
<i>how I hoped that he wished to be with me.</i>

12:18.333 --> 12:20.166
I'm not a good man.

12:24.208 --> 12:26.000
What makes a man a good man?

12:27.333 --> 12:28.500
He has to have a job.

12:29.083 --> 12:30.750
He cooks delicious food for you.

12:31.416 --> 12:32.791
He's kind.

12:32.875 --> 12:34.916
<i>I felt sad for K that he hid his pain.</i>

12:35.000 --> 12:36.166
He takes care of his family.

12:36.250 --> 12:38.208
<i>He did everything for me</i>

12:38.291 --> 12:40.333
<i>-while suffering in silence.</i>
-And…

12:43.166 --> 12:44.500
He's healthy.

12:45.708 --> 12:46.750
<i>I hope that</i>

12:47.833 --> 12:49.916
<i>I can do something for him too.</i>

12:52.041 --> 12:54.041
But you don’t have much--

12:54.125 --> 12:56.208
If Mr. Chi did this to you,

12:57.208 --> 12:58.083
what would you do?

12:58.875 --> 13:00.291
I'll kick his ass.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.958
What if you're the one who's leaving?

13:07.166 --> 13:08.750
Do you think Mr. Chi can take it?

13:23.125 --> 13:25.166
<i>After my family died,</i>

13:25.708 --> 13:27.625
<i>I transferred to K's school.</i>

13:29.083 --> 13:30.666
<i>At that time,</i>

13:30.750 --> 13:33.000
<i>I just wanted to take revenge on him.</i>

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
<i>I thought that</i>

13:37.333 --> 13:39.125
<i>if I could see him suffer,</i>

13:40.000 --> 13:41.708
<i>then I would feel better.</i>

13:46.083 --> 13:47.166
Mom.

13:49.833 --> 13:52.041
-Don't go.
-It's okay.

13:52.125 --> 13:53.958
<i>Being abandoned by his own mom</i>

13:54.750 --> 13:56.791
<i>must be worse
than being separated by death.</i>

13:59.958 --> 14:01.041
<i>I don't know</i>

14:01.708 --> 14:04.583
<i>why God wanted us to meet this way.</i>

14:04.666 --> 14:05.625
FOR SALE

14:11.958 --> 14:13.500
From now on,

14:15.416 --> 14:16.791
your name will be K.

14:16.875 --> 14:19.291
I'm Cream and you're K.

14:19.375 --> 14:21.250
Our names have the same phonetic "k."

14:22.166 --> 14:24.625
Don't you think that sounds like a family?

14:27.500 --> 14:28.541
Family?

14:29.625 --> 14:30.583
Family.

14:31.291 --> 14:32.375
From now on,

14:33.083 --> 14:34.541

14:35.583 --> 14:37.666
<i>After all, two lonely people</i>

14:38.875 --> 14:41.458
<i>should have names that don't feel lonely.</i>

14:47.458 --> 14:48.750
I understand.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.666
If this is K's last wish,

14:52.333 --> 14:53.541
then you don't have to worry.

14:54.791 --> 14:56.541
I will keep your secret.

15:01.541 --> 15:02.541
Come on, eat.

15:02.625 --> 15:03.708
Hurry up and eat. Look.

15:04.666 --> 15:06.583
It looks delicious.

15:06.666 --> 15:08.000
Hurry up and eat.

16:22.625 --> 16:24.125
<i>If he turns around,</i>

16:25.250 --> 16:26.833
<i>I'll run up</i>

16:27.791 --> 16:29.708
<i>and embrace him with all my might.</i>

16:30.833 --> 16:31.833
Turn around.

16:36.958 --> 16:38.208
Turn around.

16:41.333 --> 16:42.500
Please.

16:56.041 --> 16:58.083
<i>K never turned around.</i>

17:01.208 --> 17:04.250
<i>So I continued to act my part.</i>

17:04.333 --> 17:05.833
Your dentist friend,

17:06.500 --> 17:07.750
is he single?

17:10.458 --> 17:11.541
Are you interested in him?

17:12.750 --> 17:13.750
He's not bad.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.083
He seemed honest.

17:15.666 --> 17:16.958
He must be a good man.

17:25.458 --> 17:26.541
<i>And then, one day,</i>

17:27.375 --> 17:29.583
<i>the thing I was worried about happened.</i>

17:29.666 --> 17:31.500
She must never find out.

17:34.541 --> 17:37.458
But you need someone to take care of you.

17:40.166 --> 17:41.791
I can take care of myself.

17:43.791 --> 17:45.708
She should move on happily.

17:46.541 --> 17:48.000
She can't be held up by me.

17:51.666 --> 17:52.708
So now,

17:53.791 --> 17:55.458
do you have any other plans?

17:57.083 --> 17:58.625
I just want to see Cream happy.

18:00.916 --> 18:03.041
Before you think about other people,

18:03.125 --> 18:05.458
can you think about yourself first?

18:09.375 --> 18:10.333
Apart from her,

18:12.500 --> 18:13.541
I don't know

18:16.333 --> 18:18.250
what else I should plan for.

18:40.291 --> 18:42.416
Why all of a sudden?

18:43.041 --> 18:44.625
Let's get married, okay?

18:56.583 --> 18:57.791
K.

18:58.458 --> 19:00.125
Save your next life for me too, okay?

19:01.916 --> 19:03.250
Why in the next life?

19:06.208 --> 19:07.958
Because I like someone else in this life.

19:16.666 --> 19:18.041
You should cherish him then.

19:33.875 --> 19:34.875
<i>K.</i>

19:35.583 --> 19:36.833
<i>Maybe I can't be with you</i>

19:36.916 --> 19:38.833
<i>in this life.</i>

19:39.750 --> 19:41.583
<i>But I would like to book your next life.</i>

19:41.666 --> 19:42.958
Wait for me.

19:43.041 --> 19:44.500
I'll change to the next dress.

19:45.083 --> 19:46.458
<i>Because I'll find you</i>

19:46.541 --> 19:47.708
<i>in my next life.</i>

19:47.791 --> 19:49.500
Remember to wait for me.

20:41.500 --> 20:42.625
K.

20:46.250 --> 20:48.125
Can you help me practice

20:48.750 --> 20:49.958
the wedding ceremony process?

21:01.416 --> 21:02.666
Sung Yuan-yuan.

21:03.708 --> 21:05.625
For richer or for poorer,

21:07.291 --> 21:08.500
in sickness and in health,

21:09.708 --> 21:10.958
are you willing to marry…

21:23.708 --> 21:25.250
…this man in front of you

21:27.708 --> 21:29.000
and become his wife?

21:34.500 --> 21:35.541
I do.

22:11.666 --> 22:12.833
<i>That night,</i>

22:13.541 --> 22:15.000
<i>I got married.</i>

22:16.541 --> 22:18.625
<i>In my heart, I secretly got married</i>

22:18.708 --> 22:21.041
<i>to the man I loved the most.</i>

22:28.583 --> 22:30.333
<i>That's why on the next day</i>

22:31.208 --> 22:33.250
<i>when K put my hand in another man's hand,</i>

22:35.375 --> 22:37.000
<i>I still had the courage</i>

22:37.916 --> 22:38.833
<i>to turn my back to him</i>

22:40.458 --> 22:42.166
<i>as I walked down the other end
of the aisle.</i>

22:43.208 --> 22:46.583
For richer or for poorer,
in sickness and in health,

22:46.666 --> 22:48.958
do you take Sung Yuan-yuan
to be your wife?

22:49.041 --> 22:50.000
I do.

23:05.333 --> 23:07.000
After the wedding,

23:07.791 --> 23:09.458
no one has ever seen K.

23:11.166 --> 23:13.166
After they heard about his death,

23:15.166 --> 23:18.000
Cream brought his body back for a funeral.

23:19.791 --> 23:21.041
That funeral

23:22.375 --> 23:24.375
was also the last time they saw Cream.

23:25.583 --> 23:27.791
I can't believe the story ends like this.

23:30.333 --> 23:31.666
There is such a deep love

23:32.375 --> 23:34.708
behind this song.

23:36.708 --> 23:38.291
Hopefully, this story

23:38.375 --> 23:39.958
can help you interpret this song.

23:41.583 --> 23:42.666
Yes.

24:35.333 --> 24:37.750
Today, it's buy one, get one free.

24:39.333 --> 24:40.416
I see.

24:41.666 --> 24:42.833
Thank you.

24:44.833 --> 24:45.666
Po-han.

24:55.291 --> 24:56.583
I need to talk to you.

24:59.250 --> 25:01.083
RESIGNATION APPLICATION, AN YI-CHI
DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS

25:04.375 --> 25:05.416
You're resigning?

25:06.375 --> 25:07.666
I'm sorry, Po-han.

25:12.083 --> 25:13.500
I'm really tired these days.

25:15.250 --> 25:16.833
I want to rest.

25:18.916 --> 25:20.458
As for the copyright issue,

25:20.541 --> 25:22.000
I took care of it.

25:23.041 --> 25:24.166
This case

25:24.875 --> 25:26.333
is done as well.

25:26.916 --> 25:29.000
Other cases are not that urgent.

25:29.500 --> 25:30.666
I'll hand it over.

25:31.375 --> 25:32.375
So…

25:36.125 --> 25:37.666
I'll give you a long vacation.

25:39.041 --> 25:40.458
But you can't quit.

25:41.833 --> 25:43.625
It wouldn't be fair to our colleagues.

25:43.708 --> 25:44.666
I don't want that.

25:47.291 --> 25:48.791
As for the money I owe you,

25:48.875 --> 25:50.416
I'll try to pay you back.

25:50.500 --> 25:52.250
-It's not about the money.
-Please give me more time.

25:52.333 --> 25:54.541
-You can tell me what it is.
-There's nothing.

25:57.541 --> 25:59.333
I just need a break.

26:06.500 --> 26:08.541
After the next two days,

26:09.666 --> 26:10.625
I'll leave.

26:14.333 --> 26:15.583
I'm sorry, I have a meeting.

26:17.041 --> 26:18.166
An Yi-chi!

26:30.250 --> 26:34.125
KUNG LI-NA IS EXPECTED
TO RETURN AS AN ACTRESS

26:34.208 --> 26:38.291
HER PASSIONATE PERFORMANCE
EVEN MOVED THE DIRECTOR

26:43.791 --> 26:47.791
KUNG LI-NA: CAN WE TALK?

26:51.625 --> 26:56.208
KUNG LI-NA: I HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU.

27:03.958 --> 27:05.250
Cindy Studio.

27:06.333 --> 27:07.166
Yes.

27:10.125 --> 27:10.958
Okay.

27:12.625 --> 27:13.833
Yang Yu-hsien?

27:13.916 --> 27:14.958
Yes.

27:15.041 --> 27:16.000
He said

27:16.083 --> 27:18.000
you took the photos for him back then.

27:18.625 --> 27:20.083
He still thinks you're the best.

27:20.166 --> 27:21.583
So he wants you to take it.

27:29.625 --> 27:31.541
Should I decline him then?

27:40.916 --> 27:42.416
You're more experienced.

27:42.500 --> 27:44.208
You even brought in props.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.333
Didn't you tell me to bring something,

27:46.416 --> 27:48.458
so I won't get nervous?

28:06.583 --> 28:09.208
I'll have my assistant call you
once the photo is done.

28:09.875 --> 28:10.708
Okay.

28:11.208 --> 28:12.291
Time flies.

28:12.375 --> 28:13.500
You already have an assistant.

28:14.166 --> 28:15.500
You became a director too.

28:17.958 --> 28:20.666
So why did you ask me
to take the pictures?

28:23.958 --> 28:25.041
It's nothing.

28:25.958 --> 28:26.916
I just…

28:27.750 --> 28:29.375
I just wanted to know how you were doing.

28:30.666 --> 28:32.708
A while ago,
a record company came to see me.

28:34.500 --> 28:36.500
It made me recall the past.

28:37.583 --> 28:39.333
It also made me reconsider things.

28:40.708 --> 28:42.041
What do you mean?

28:47.291 --> 28:48.166
Nothing.

29:00.791 --> 29:01.833
You…

29:04.375 --> 29:05.500
Are you okay?

29:09.125 --> 29:10.541
About Sung Yuan-yuan.

29:16.666 --> 29:17.958
How can I be okay?

29:22.166 --> 29:23.541
It's not your fault.

29:38.208 --> 29:39.041
Bye.

31:07.541 --> 31:08.875
Li-na.

31:10.375 --> 31:11.625
Where's your son?

31:11.708 --> 31:13.000
I don't see him.

31:14.625 --> 31:17.416
I bought this video game for him.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.208
I saw

31:21.291 --> 31:23.708
that your son shared a photo
of your vacation.

31:25.125 --> 31:26.333
Why did you come here?

31:27.041 --> 31:28.125
I want to ask you,

31:29.500 --> 31:32.041
what's your relationship with Po-han?

31:36.000 --> 31:37.958
<i>Back then, he did a lot for me.</i>

31:39.041 --> 31:40.083
He did so much

31:40.166 --> 31:42.166
that I took everything for granted.

31:42.958 --> 31:44.625
But I hurt him.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.125
Do you think

31:48.458 --> 31:50.291
a terrible person like me

31:51.583 --> 31:53.375
can have a second chance?

31:57.041 --> 31:59.083
Who doesn't want a second chance?

32:01.958 --> 32:05.625
<i>If starting over is possible.</i>

32:08.916 --> 32:10.875
What wine would you like?

32:11.500 --> 32:13.666
It's okay. Just give me sparkling water.

32:13.750 --> 32:15.250
Okay. I'll take the menu for you.

32:15.333 --> 32:16.375
Thank you.

32:16.458 --> 32:17.333
Thank you.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
You quit drinking?

32:25.625 --> 32:26.500
Because of you.

32:29.375 --> 32:30.791
Stop saying that.

32:31.458 --> 32:33.708
It's true. Why don't you believe me?

32:35.791 --> 32:37.000
Did you read

32:37.083 --> 32:38.708
the article I sent you?

32:40.458 --> 32:41.375
Yes.

32:41.458 --> 32:43.416
You'll never guess this.

32:44.041 --> 32:47.416
It was Mr. Hsu who called me.

32:47.500 --> 32:49.333
I had no idea.

32:49.958 --> 32:51.583
But this time, I worked very hard.

32:51.666 --> 32:54.250
From clothing
to reading scripts and rehearsing,

32:54.333 --> 32:56.125
I've never been absent once.

32:56.208 --> 32:57.708
Last week, there was a big scene.

32:57.791 --> 32:59.166
It was done after our first take.

32:59.250 --> 33:01.833
-I was surprised when I watched it.
-Li-na.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.291
What are you trying to say?

33:16.125 --> 33:17.583
I want to ask you.

33:18.791 --> 33:20.250
Can we still be together?

33:28.541 --> 33:30.208
It's over between us.

33:37.625 --> 33:39.000
Please tell me.

33:39.708 --> 33:40.833
What must I do

33:40.916 --> 33:42.125
for you to forgive me?

33:43.541 --> 33:44.666
For you,

33:44.750 --> 33:45.833
I quit drinking.

33:45.916 --> 33:47.291
I fixed my temper.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.458
I worked hard.

33:49.541 --> 33:50.875
I just want to be good enough for you.

33:52.041 --> 33:53.791
After what happened back then,

33:53.875 --> 33:57.291
just how bad of a person
did I become in your mind?

33:57.375 --> 33:59.416
Can't you even give me a chance?

34:05.625 --> 34:07.041
You were once

34:07.125 --> 34:10.000
very, very important to me.

34:15.666 --> 34:16.875
But it's in the past.

34:20.125 --> 34:22.708
Seeing you quit drinking for work

34:23.500 --> 34:24.958
makes me feel happy for you.

34:25.833 --> 34:26.833
Really.

34:28.833 --> 34:30.833
And I wish you the best.

34:32.750 --> 34:34.000
But I think

34:34.625 --> 34:36.041
we should stay as friends.

34:44.958 --> 34:47.000
If there's nothing else,

34:47.916 --> 34:49.333
I'll get going.

34:55.333 --> 34:56.666
Nice try.

34:58.583 --> 34:59.958
It's because of An Yi-chi, isn't it?

35:03.000 --> 35:04.500
Did she initiate it?

35:06.500 --> 35:07.708
What are you talking about?

35:08.416 --> 35:09.708
You're funny.

35:10.333 --> 35:12.166
She has a kid.

35:13.375 --> 35:15.625
Did she use the child
to make you pity her?

35:16.875 --> 35:18.458
Did you look into her?

35:18.541 --> 35:20.416
Why can't I do that?

35:21.166 --> 35:23.166
If there's anyone
who stands between the two of us,

35:23.250 --> 35:24.583
I won't let them go.

35:28.166 --> 35:29.166
Darn it.

35:29.666 --> 35:31.541
She told me she'd stay away from you.

35:32.083 --> 35:33.416
What a complete lie.

35:34.125 --> 35:35.708
You can tell me what it is.

35:35.791 --> 35:36.958
There's nothing.

35:37.541 --> 35:39.375
I just need a break.

35:47.291 --> 35:48.625
You're hopeless.

35:51.541 --> 35:53.000
Don't you leave, Wang Po-han!

35:58.166 --> 36:01.083
Please don't leave me, okay?

36:01.708 --> 36:03.250
I'm begging you, please.

36:03.333 --> 36:05.041
I'm really tired.

36:05.125 --> 36:06.583
Put down the knife first, okay?

36:06.666 --> 36:08.208
You leave me with no choice!

36:08.291 --> 36:09.291
Okay.

36:09.375 --> 36:10.583
I'm not leaving.

36:10.666 --> 36:12.166
-Don't leave. Don't come near me.
-Okay.

36:12.250 --> 36:13.583
Sure. Whatever you say.

36:13.666 --> 36:15.708
I promise not to leave, okay?

36:15.791 --> 36:17.041
Put the knife down.

36:18.625 --> 36:20.625
-I'm here.
-Don't leave me.

36:21.416 --> 36:24.000
Kung Li-na, let's talk it out.

36:25.583 --> 36:26.750
Don't leave.

36:27.250 --> 36:28.791
-Put the knife away. Come on.
-No.

36:29.583 --> 36:30.625
Let me go.

36:30.708 --> 36:32.416
Give me the knife. Just give it to me!

36:34.916 --> 36:36.041
Call an ambulance!

36:36.125 --> 36:37.208
Hurry up!

36:38.541 --> 36:40.958
-Ambulance. Call an ambulance!
-Okay.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.000
I'm sorry.
