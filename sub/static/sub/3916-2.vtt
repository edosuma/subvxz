00:00.839 --> 00:02.005
<i>Previously on "The Fosters"...</i>

00:02.041 --> 00:03.441
- What's your name?
- A.J.

00:03.475 --> 00:05.176
This is a guy that me
and my brother made up.

00:05.210 --> 00:07.111
We put the symbol in the
windows of our bedrooms.

00:07.146 --> 00:08.313
Like a Bat signal?

00:08.347 --> 00:10.348
- Brandon Foster, piano.
- You're here as a composer.

00:10.382 --> 00:12.350
You're a composer too, huh? I'm Tony.

00:12.384 --> 00:14.085
Man: Brandon, you'll be working with Kat.

00:14.119 --> 00:15.954
There's no way you're pairing me with him.

00:15.988 --> 00:17.055
Sometimes I just want to die.

00:17.089 --> 00:19.057
Maybe we could do some other stuff tonight.

00:19.091 --> 00:21.059
I don't want to do it.
I mean, I want to do it,

00:21.093 --> 00:23.895
but not like this. It's
our first time, and...

00:23.929 --> 00:25.063
We gotta get on the road.

00:25.097 --> 00:26.764
Want a beer?

00:28.934 --> 00:30.702
- A.J.?
- What's wrong?

00:30.736 --> 00:32.070
I let someone sleep here.

00:32.104 --> 00:34.672
Damn it, Callie. Why?

00:34.707 --> 00:36.674
You're fired.

00:37.810 --> 00:39.611
Mariana: Are you almost done in there?

00:39.645 --> 00:40.878
You do know that we're in the worst drought

00:40.913 --> 00:42.547
since 800 A.D., right?

00:42.581 --> 00:43.781
Stef: Oh my gosh, I forgot my conditioner.

00:43.816 --> 00:45.583
Can you go get it from our bathroom, honey?

00:45.618 --> 00:47.685
Okay, well, can you not
waste water while you wait?

00:52.725 --> 00:54.792
Hey, I'm late, and I need to shower too.

00:54.827 --> 00:56.494
Hello?

00:56.528 --> 00:58.730
Why don't you take a spit
bath in the kitchen sink?

00:58.764 --> 01:00.431
Wait, what's a spit bath?

01:00.466 --> 01:01.766
I don't know. Sounds disgusting,

01:01.800 --> 01:04.302
- but I'm next.
- (Aggravated sigh)

01:07.272 --> 01:08.473
Excuse me.

01:08.507 --> 01:10.375
You got wood rot.

01:10.409 --> 01:12.477
Wood rot? That doesn't sound good.

01:12.511 --> 01:14.278
It isn't.

01:14.313 --> 01:17.215
You'll have to open up the
wall. And while you're at it,

01:17.249 --> 01:18.583
I recommend you upgrade to copper plumbing.

01:18.617 --> 01:21.185
- Okay, honey, I need...
- Honey.

01:21.220 --> 01:22.420
- What?
- The guy is here.

01:22.454 --> 01:24.322
Yeah. Hey, how is it going?
I need my conditioner.

01:24.356 --> 01:26.224
- Okay, I will bring it to you.
- I'll get it.

01:26.258 --> 01:28.126
Thank you. It's the blue one in the...

01:28.160 --> 01:30.094
- Okay, I will bring it to you.
- Would you quit pushing me?

01:30.129 --> 01:32.163
- Dear, honey, please.
- Argh!

01:32.197 --> 01:35.199
- So that's your... ?
- Yes.

01:37.403 --> 01:40.071
So, Sophia's coming over today.

01:40.105 --> 01:41.906
How's she doing?

01:41.940 --> 01:43.274
Good, I think.

01:43.308 --> 01:45.877
We're just gonna hang out.

01:45.911 --> 01:47.845
But Robert invited us

01:47.880 --> 01:50.048
to spend Father's Day on his boat.

01:51.183 --> 01:52.884
No, thanks.

01:52.918 --> 01:54.752
You're totally welcome.

01:54.787 --> 01:56.854
Stef: Welcome to what?

01:56.889 --> 01:58.823
If you're gonna spend Father's
Day with him, don't you think

01:58.857 --> 02:00.658
it's weird to keep calling him Robert?

02:00.693 --> 02:02.794
- Morning.
- Morning, love.

02:02.828 --> 02:05.029
- I don't have to go.
- I don't care if you go,

02:05.064 --> 02:06.831
but he's not my dad.

02:06.865 --> 02:09.800
You don't have to always
invite me. It's okay.

02:09.835 --> 02:12.937
Well, listen, Jude, we're
having Mike over on Sunday...

02:12.971 --> 02:14.939
kind of a family
tradition for Father's Day,

02:14.973 --> 02:16.908
you know, to celebrate

02:16.942 --> 02:18.776
the important men in our lives.

02:18.811 --> 02:21.846
I guess we won't have to make
cheese blintzes this year, will we?

02:21.880 --> 02:25.450
- Cheese blintzes?
- Yeah, they were my father's favorites.

02:25.484 --> 02:28.419
My first Father's Day without a father.

02:28.454 --> 02:30.621
It's certainly not gonna be a party

02:30.656 --> 02:32.590
without Frank around to offend somebody.

02:32.624 --> 02:36.394
- I'm sure you'll manage that.
- (Chuckles) That's funny.

02:36.428 --> 02:38.396
Can I invite my dad?

02:38.430 --> 02:39.697
Donald?

02:39.732 --> 02:41.632
- Yeah.
- Why?

02:41.667 --> 02:43.501
You're spending the day with your dad.

02:43.535 --> 02:46.437
- It's a little different.
- How is it different?

02:46.472 --> 02:50.241
Well, for starters, Robert
actually wants to be in my life.

02:50.275 --> 02:52.210
Donald just signed the
papers and walked away.

02:52.244 --> 02:53.377
Robert signed the papers, too.

02:53.412 --> 02:55.213
Is he better because he's rich?

02:55.247 --> 02:57.048
Donald doesn't want
anything to do with you.

02:57.082 --> 02:58.416
- You don't know what he wants.
- It's pretty obvious.

02:58.450 --> 03:00.952
- Why do you hate him so much?
- 'Cause he killed our mother.

03:00.986 --> 03:02.253
- Callie.
- It was an accident.

03:02.287 --> 03:05.123
- Drunk driving is not an accident.
- Okay, that's enough.

03:05.157 --> 03:07.258
If Jude wants to invite Donald...

03:07.292 --> 03:09.861
Then he's welcome to.

03:11.296 --> 03:13.264
Fine.

03:13.298 --> 03:16.167
But don't be surprised
when he doesn't show up.

It's perfect...

04:23.101 --> 04:25.203
- Thank you.
- ... Technically,

04:25.237 --> 04:27.839
but your melody's anemic,

04:27.873 --> 04:29.774
your rhythmic statements are mundane,

04:29.808 --> 04:31.909
and your intervals are reductive.

04:31.944 --> 04:34.912
The whole piece is utterly jejune.

04:34.947 --> 04:37.215
(Stammers)

04:37.249 --> 04:40.785
Considering the amount of time that I had,

04:40.819 --> 04:42.220
I did the best I could.

04:42.254 --> 04:45.957
Those are the five most pathetic
words in the English language.

04:45.991 --> 04:48.960
People who are satisfied with the
best they can do will never be great.

04:48.994 --> 04:50.161
Six, actually.

04:50.195 --> 04:51.829
I'm sorry, what?

04:51.864 --> 04:53.831
Six words.

04:53.866 --> 04:55.900
I never said I was satisfied.

04:55.934 --> 04:57.802
- I just...
- Then start over.

04:59.872 --> 05:01.005
Fine.

05:01.099 --> 05:03.167
Okay, I'll meet you here
at 8:00 tomorrow morning.

05:03.201 --> 05:04.936
Wait, tomorrow?

05:04.970 --> 05:06.938
I gotta sleep at some point.

05:06.972 --> 05:08.973
You have your whole life to sleep.

05:09.007 --> 05:11.208
We have one shot at Disney Hall.

05:11.323 --> 05:13.224
Get inspired.

05:15.260 --> 05:17.061
And take a shower.

05:19.097 --> 05:21.966
We got one working bathroom at home,

05:22.000 --> 05:24.301
six people.

05:24.336 --> 05:27.071
I'm just saying.

05:27.105 --> 05:28.973
How is it going with Kat?

05:29.007 --> 05:31.375
Oh, you know, she's...

05:31.410 --> 05:34.111
A bitch?

05:34.146 --> 05:36.013
Hey, man, we're all bitches.

05:36.048 --> 05:37.982
And this bitch would give his left nut

05:38.016 --> 05:39.950
to compose for Kat.

05:39.985 --> 05:43.020
Well, if it was up to
me, you could have her.

05:43.055 --> 05:45.022
'Cause I'm pretty sure nothing I do

05:45.057 --> 05:46.323
is gonna be good enough for her.

05:46.358 --> 05:48.059
It won't be.

05:48.093 --> 05:50.061
But if you can take the heat,

05:50.095 --> 05:51.996
she's your golden ticket, man.

05:54.132 --> 05:56.967
How do you stay so calm and cool?

05:57.002 --> 05:58.069
I'm a cool dude.

06:01.173 --> 06:03.140
- How's your fugue?
- It's pretty tight.

06:03.175 --> 06:05.142
Can I hear it?

06:05.177 --> 06:07.144
Yeah, sure.

06:22.327 --> 06:25.029
It's so cute.

06:25.063 --> 06:27.064
I ordered it online last week.

06:27.099 --> 06:30.067
Why don't you give it to Isabella yourself?

06:30.102 --> 06:32.169
Um, I think

06:32.204 --> 06:34.205
Ana needs some space.

06:34.239 --> 06:36.340
Well, I'll see that she gets it.

06:36.408 --> 06:38.342
But...

06:38.376 --> 06:41.178
I hope you're still
coming for Father's Day.

06:41.213 --> 06:43.147
It would mean the world to Victor.

06:43.181 --> 06:46.050
And your uncles and cousins will be here,

06:46.084 --> 06:49.186
and everybody is so excited to meet you.

06:49.221 --> 06:51.255
Look.

06:54.426 --> 06:56.260
- Is Ana coming?
- Of course.

06:56.294 --> 06:58.195
She says her brothers
are upset that she's back

06:58.230 --> 06:59.964
and living with you.

06:59.998 --> 07:02.099
They're wary about their sister.

07:02.134 --> 07:06.036
She put us all through a lot.

07:06.071 --> 07:08.072
It's gonna take time to trust her.

07:08.106 --> 07:09.940
But we're family.

07:09.975 --> 07:11.308
And don't worry,

07:11.343 --> 07:13.844
we're gonna keep the
party small and intimate.

07:13.949 --> 07:15.382
Please say you'll come.

07:18.920 --> 07:20.854
Do your moms know you got fired?

07:20.889 --> 07:22.823
I haven't told them yet.

07:22.857 --> 07:25.059
I want to try to find

07:25.093 --> 07:27.962
some other independent
study first, you know,

07:27.996 --> 07:30.064
so they don't totally freak out.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.867
So where's this A.J. guy now?

07:33.902 --> 07:35.736
I don't know.

07:35.770 --> 07:37.738
Living on the streets probably.

07:37.772 --> 07:39.006
Was he cute?

07:39.040 --> 07:42.009
That's not why I tried to help him.

07:42.043 --> 07:43.911
Okay, but he was hot, right?

07:43.945 --> 07:46.046
- Stop it.
- I'm just saying.

07:47.082 --> 07:49.683
How's everything with you?

07:49.718 --> 07:50.784
Fine.

07:50.819 --> 07:51.919
You sure?

07:51.953 --> 07:53.854
Yes.

07:53.888 --> 07:56.624
And I wish that everyone would
stop asking me that question

07:56.658 --> 07:58.592
every five seconds.

07:59.728 --> 08:03.497
- (Cell phone rings)
- Sorry.

08:06.635 --> 08:07.768
Hello.

08:07.802 --> 08:10.671
<i>Hey, it's me... A.J.</i>

08:13.575 --> 08:15.676
- I'll just be right back.
- Okay.

08:20.649 --> 08:23.584
- Are you in juvie? <i>
- I got arrested.</i>

08:23.618 --> 08:25.519
- For huffing.<i>
- Tagging.</i>

08:25.553 --> 08:27.421
<i>Gang signs. But I didn't...</i>

08:27.455 --> 08:29.390
I really don't care.

08:29.424 --> 08:31.759
<i>Callie, please, I need your help.</i>

08:31.793 --> 08:34.761
I tried to help you
and you screwed me over.

08:34.796 --> 08:37.298
<i>I'm not in a gang.</i>

08:37.332 --> 08:38.666
Good for you. I gotta go.

08:38.700 --> 08:40.400
<i>Wait.</i>

08:40.434 --> 08:42.236
<i>There's a skate park on Oceanside.</i>

08:42.270 --> 08:44.203
<i>Go check it out. You'll see.</i>

08:44.239 --> 08:46.440
<i>Please.</i>

08:46.474 --> 08:49.476
<i>Callie. Please?</i>

08:51.379 --> 08:53.347
Do me a favor, lose my number.

08:55.183 --> 08:57.184
Callie.

08:57.218 --> 08:59.086
I spoke with Donald,

08:59.120 --> 09:01.155
and he would like to come tomorrow.

09:01.189 --> 09:03.123
- Okay.
- Is it?

09:03.158 --> 09:05.259
Oh, I won't be here, so
I won't have to see him.

09:05.293 --> 09:08.062
You want to talk about it?

09:08.096 --> 09:09.997
No, thank you.

09:10.031 --> 09:11.865
Sophia's outside.

09:25.180 --> 09:27.114
Look, I'm really sorry about before.

09:27.148 --> 09:29.717
I... I'm on these new meds,

09:29.751 --> 09:31.685
and they make me sort of irritable,

09:31.720 --> 09:33.954
as my mother would say.

09:33.988 --> 09:35.956
It's fine.

09:40.595 --> 09:43.630
You want to get out of here?

09:43.665 --> 09:45.599
Yeah.

09:45.633 --> 09:47.568
Where do you want to go?

09:48.703 --> 09:50.604
Man: Nice one.

09:50.638 --> 09:52.606
What are we looking for?

09:52.640 --> 09:54.608
I'm not exactly sure.

09:58.446 --> 09:59.680
There.

10:02.617 --> 10:04.718
What is it?

10:04.753 --> 10:07.521
It's a Bat signal.

10:16.912 --> 10:21.482
- (Distant band playing)
- (People chattering)

10:29.625 --> 10:31.359
Hey.

10:32.728 --> 10:34.395
We're having a party.

10:34.430 --> 10:35.763
No kidding.

10:35.798 --> 10:38.332
Come on, take a break.

10:38.367 --> 10:41.269
- Come have a beer.
- No, I... I can't.

10:41.303 --> 10:42.370
Just one beer.

10:42.404 --> 10:44.338
No, I... I... I really can't.

10:44.373 --> 10:46.207
How's it going?

10:46.241 --> 10:47.442
It's not.

10:47.476 --> 10:49.377
Yeah, that's right. You know why?

10:49.411 --> 10:51.212
'Cause you're all in your head.

10:51.246 --> 10:52.580
Come on, man, you gotta chillax.

10:52.614 --> 10:54.582
Look, even if I wanted to chillax,

10:54.616 --> 10:56.384
I would still have to
drive home and then get up

10:56.418 --> 10:59.020
at the crack of ass to
get back here by 8:00.

10:59.054 --> 11:00.988
You don't have to get
up at the crack of ass,

11:01.023 --> 11:02.457
'cause your ass can crash in my crib...

11:04.159 --> 11:06.160
On one condition.

11:12.134 --> 11:14.168
One beer and then I gotta get back to work.

11:14.203 --> 11:16.137
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

11:21.009 --> 11:23.845
- What?
- Kat.

11:23.879 --> 11:24.979
Uh-oh.

11:25.013 --> 11:26.948
Brandon.

11:26.982 --> 11:28.216
Get over here.

11:29.251 --> 11:30.952
Go.

11:34.923 --> 11:37.225
Hey. I was just having one beer.

11:37.259 --> 11:38.993
Well, that's no fun.

11:39.027 --> 11:41.195
Come on, let's do Tequila shots.

11:47.035 --> 11:50.004
Hey, A.J. I'm Stef.

11:50.038 --> 11:51.639
What's this?

11:51.673 --> 11:53.641
This is my foster mom.

11:53.675 --> 11:56.010
You asked me for help.

11:56.044 --> 11:58.012
Go ahead, have a seat.

11:58.046 --> 11:59.947
I won't bite.

12:03.886 --> 12:06.521
Callie tells me that you're
looking for your brother,

12:06.555 --> 12:08.689
you think he might be
missing. Does he have a name?

12:08.724 --> 12:11.659
- Is he in trouble?
- Well, you tell me.

12:11.693 --> 12:13.628
I mean, because I ran
away to meet up with him?

12:13.662 --> 12:16.664
- Yeah, but you didn't meet up with him, did you?
- No, he never showed.

12:16.698 --> 12:18.533
Okay, what was the plan if he had showed?

12:18.567 --> 12:20.535
We were gonna go to Arizona.

12:20.569 --> 12:22.804
He said knew some guy that
could get him a job there

12:22.838 --> 12:24.672
in construction.

12:26.698 --> 12:29.433
We just wanted to be together.

12:29.467 --> 12:31.635
You were arrested for tagging, yes?

12:31.669 --> 12:34.671
Yeah, but cops just assume that
'cause I'm black I'm in a gang.

12:34.706 --> 12:36.607
Yeah, well, I don't assume that.

12:36.641 --> 12:38.742
But, you know, it is
illegal to deface property,

12:38.776 --> 12:41.378
even if you are just leaving
a message for someone.

12:41.412 --> 12:42.846
Look, I was gonna turn myself in.

12:42.881 --> 12:45.549
But I knew that once I got back in
the system, I'd be harder to find.

12:45.583 --> 12:47.618
I just wanted Ty to know where I was.

12:47.652 --> 12:49.653
- Ty?
- Tyrone Hensdale.

12:49.687 --> 12:52.322
That's my brother.

12:52.357 --> 12:55.192
Is there any chance that he might
have gone to Arizona by himself?

12:55.226 --> 12:57.494
No, there's no chance.

12:59.597 --> 13:02.499
If he didn't show, it's 'cause
something happened to him.

13:02.533 --> 13:05.168
Okay, fair enough.

13:05.203 --> 13:07.137
I'll see what I can do.

13:09.107 --> 13:11.108
Are you gonna be okay in here?

13:11.142 --> 13:13.343
I'll be fine.

13:13.378 --> 13:15.412
Thank you.

13:32.931 --> 13:34.264
(Applause)

13:34.299 --> 13:36.266
That was fun.

13:36.301 --> 13:38.168
You are fun.

13:38.202 --> 13:40.871
Well, you are fun.

13:40.905 --> 13:42.139
What, does that surprise you?

13:42.173 --> 13:45.008
A little, yeah.

13:45.043 --> 13:47.844
Listen, we got off on the wrong foot.

13:49.180 --> 13:51.915
Do you know what the soul of genius is?

13:51.950 --> 13:53.750
Uh...

13:53.785 --> 13:56.687
Love. That's what Mozart said.

13:56.721 --> 13:59.623
- Love.
- Right.

13:59.657 --> 14:01.792
I need to love you.

14:04.629 --> 14:05.762
Okay.

14:05.797 --> 14:07.698
I also need to pee.

14:07.732 --> 14:09.833
Go for it.

14:12.637 --> 14:13.870
Hey, you.

14:14.906 --> 14:17.541
We are going to Disney Hall.

14:17.575 --> 14:19.810
All right.

14:19.844 --> 14:21.678
And I'm sleeping in tomorrow.

14:21.713 --> 14:22.746
Great.

14:26.751 --> 14:28.719
You're fun.

14:28.753 --> 14:30.554
You're really fun.

14:47.739 --> 14:49.706
(Phone buzzes)

15:15.199 --> 15:17.267
Kat: These kids are so lax.
I haven't heard a single fugue

15:17.301 --> 15:19.169
that's worthy of being
played at Disney Hall.

15:19.203 --> 15:21.304
Okay, see? This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

15:21.339 --> 15:23.407
I'm willing to get up on a
Sunday morning to work with him,

15:23.441 --> 15:25.308
- and he's 30 minutes late.
- What happened, Brandon?

15:25.343 --> 15:27.277
I overslept. I'm sorry.

15:27.311 --> 15:29.079
Did you rewrite your fugue?

15:30.214 --> 15:32.349
No, I didn't get a chance to finish it.

15:32.383 --> 15:34.985
Why? What were you doing all night?

15:36.387 --> 15:38.989
He's obviously not taking
the program seriously.

15:39.023 --> 15:41.058
Tony said he's willing to
compose for two pianists.

15:41.092 --> 15:43.927
Okay, you know what? I did write
a fugue. She didn't like it.

15:43.961 --> 15:45.162
- It was so...
- Jejune.

15:45.196 --> 15:47.330
Yeah, I know. Whatever the hell that means.

15:47.365 --> 15:49.299
And now he's defensive.

15:49.333 --> 15:52.869
I deserve a partner as
talented and dedicated as I am.

15:52.904 --> 15:54.838
Okay, Kat. I hear you.

15:54.872 --> 15:56.973
Let me think about it.

15:57.008 --> 16:00.143
In the meantime, Brandon,
let's hear what you've got.

16:13.851 --> 16:16.700
Robert: "Good for a batch of fresh cookies"

16:16.706 --> 16:18.674
- (Sophia giggles) Yeah.
- Sounds delicious.

16:18.708 --> 16:20.709
- "Good for a day at the movies."
- Always.

16:20.743 --> 16:24.346
- "Good for one car wash." I like that. I like that.
- Yeah.

16:24.380 --> 16:25.714
Oh, I like this one.

16:25.748 --> 16:27.717
"Good for one 20 minute foot rub."

16:27.791 --> 16:29.358
- Can I redeem this right now?
- Oh, yeah.

16:29.392 --> 16:32.161
I'm sure Callie wants to
watch me rub your feet.

16:32.195 --> 16:34.263
I love all these. These are great,

16:34.297 --> 16:36.298
except for this one.

16:36.333 --> 16:38.167
I <i>get</i> to teach you to drive?

16:38.201 --> 16:41.036
Well, yeah. Callie's getting her license.

16:41.071 --> 16:43.939
I haven't done the test
yet, so fingers crossed.

16:43.974 --> 16:45.975
I'm sure you'll pass with flying colors.

16:46.009 --> 16:47.977
And you have a birthday coming up too.

16:48.011 --> 16:50.946
Yes, we're gonna have a party at the house,

16:50.981 --> 16:52.982
so I'd love for you all to come.

16:53.016 --> 16:55.718
Of course. We'd love to. We'll be there.

16:58.755 --> 17:00.789
Sophia, you need to eat something.

17:00.824 --> 17:01.957
And I will.

17:04.094 --> 17:06.595
So, Dad,

17:06.630 --> 17:08.931
I have something for you.

17:08.964 --> 17:11.534
It's no big deal.

17:11.568 --> 17:13.002
Uh, yes, it is.

17:13.036 --> 17:15.604
Yeah, it's a huge deal. (Chuckles)

17:18.942 --> 17:20.876
Oh, wow.

17:24.481 --> 17:26.615
- You took this?
- You don't have to hang it up or anything.

17:26.650 --> 17:28.450
Are you kidding me? Of
course I'm gonna hang it up.

17:28.484 --> 17:30.452
It's beautiful. Look.

17:30.487 --> 17:32.454
Oh my gosh, Callie, it's amazing.

17:32.489 --> 17:33.856
Wow, you're very talented.

17:33.890 --> 17:36.559
Okay, put it away now, please.

17:36.593 --> 17:38.727
Robert: Wow.

17:40.630 --> 17:42.731
- Mom.
- Sophia.

17:45.502 --> 17:47.478
I can't take my meds on an empty stomach.

17:47.479 --> 17:50.340
And God forbid I don't take them
everyday at the exact same time.

17:50.345 --> 17:52.157
- I'm just following your doctor's orders, Sophia.
- Okay, well,

17:52.242 --> 17:55.411
you'll be happy when you don't
have me to worry about anymore.

17:56.246 --> 17:57.446
What does that mean?

17:57.480 --> 18:01.450
When I get better, of course.

18:05.355 --> 18:07.289
He doesn't have a record, you know.

18:07.324 --> 18:08.557
He's never been in trouble before.

18:08.592 --> 18:10.426
I spoke to his foster parents,

18:10.460 --> 18:12.461
and they said that he's a good student,

18:12.495 --> 18:16.265
always followed the
rules until he ran away.

18:16.299 --> 18:18.267
And they won't take him back?

18:18.301 --> 18:20.169
Not everybody gives second chances.

18:20.203 --> 18:23.405
- Or thirds, or fourths.
- Ha-ha. I don't know,

18:23.440 --> 18:25.456
there's just something
about him. He's a good kid.

18:26.157 --> 18:28.257
And I think the longer
he stays in detention,

18:28.283 --> 18:30.962
the more at risk he is of
getting into some real trouble.

18:31.036 --> 18:32.336
You're thinking about fostering him?

18:32.371 --> 18:34.372
No, no, no, no, no. We can't.

18:34.374 --> 18:38.409
But I was thinking about you fostering him.

18:38.443 --> 18:40.978
Me?

18:41.013 --> 18:43.281
Yeah, why not you?

18:55.861 --> 18:58.129
Mariana.

18:58.163 --> 19:00.197
Are you leaving already?

19:00.232 --> 19:02.967
Oh.

19:03.203 --> 19:04.238
I actually haven't gone in yet.

19:07.072 --> 19:08.773
Where's Isabella?

19:08.872 --> 19:11.073
She's with my mother.

19:11.075 --> 19:13.075
Have you gone in?

19:15.746 --> 19:18.748
No. Not yet.

19:18.782 --> 19:20.916
Are you going to?

19:22.052 --> 19:23.753
I don't think so.

19:23.787 --> 19:25.721
Why not?

19:25.756 --> 19:28.624
Because I'm embarrassed.

19:28.659 --> 19:30.660
Of what?

19:30.694 --> 19:33.696
Of being your daughter.

19:35.270 --> 19:36.654
(Knocks on door)

19:40.671 --> 19:42.605
- Hi.
- Hey.

19:42.639 --> 19:43.939
How are you?

19:44.054 --> 19:46.789
Good. Come in.

19:46.823 --> 19:48.858
Thanks.

19:53.730 --> 19:55.531
Happy Father's Day.

19:55.565 --> 19:56.832
Oh, thanks.

19:56.867 --> 19:58.801
These are for your moms.

19:58.835 --> 20:00.803
They love flowers.

20:00.837 --> 20:02.538
That's good.

20:02.572 --> 20:04.640
You... you're, like, a foot taller, huh?

20:04.674 --> 20:07.510
Yeah, my moms say I'm gonna have to
start cutting my pants into shorts.

20:07.544 --> 20:08.844
Yeah, I had that problem
when I was a kid too.

20:08.879 --> 20:10.713
- How tall are you?
- Six feet.

20:10.747 --> 20:12.481
You're gonna be taller. My dad...

20:12.516 --> 20:14.416
your granddad... was six-three.

20:14.451 --> 20:17.753
So is Callie here?

20:17.755 --> 20:19.789
No, she's with her dad...

20:19.823 --> 20:22.358
I mean, Robert.

20:23.660 --> 20:25.394
Yeah.

20:25.428 --> 20:28.464
A friend of mine's
coming over, with his dad.

20:28.498 --> 20:29.299
Okay.

20:29.683 --> 20:31.784
But don't worry, they
don't know that you were,

20:32.119 --> 20:34.187
you know, in prison.

20:35.569 --> 20:37.536
So you don't have to...

20:37.571 --> 20:40.473
Yeah. No, it's...

20:40.507 --> 20:42.308
it's okay, Jude.

20:46.910 --> 20:48.216
Hey, hey.

20:48.519 --> 20:53.256
So Jude doesn't want his dad to know...

20:54.292 --> 20:56.226
about him and me.

20:56.260 --> 20:59.095
I got no problem with that.

20:59.130 --> 21:01.264
The fewer people that know, the better.

21:06.437 --> 21:08.371
Look at all those fake smiles.

21:10.241 --> 21:13.109
- They think I don't know.
- Know what?

21:13.144 --> 21:15.145
That they're sending
me back to the hospital

21:16.679 --> 21:19.064
or to one of those therapy boarding schools

21:19.065 --> 21:20.365
where they lock you up.

21:20.484 --> 21:22.118
- How do you know?
- It's my mom.

21:22.153 --> 21:24.254
She is afraid to leave me alone,

21:24.288 --> 21:25.989
afraid I'll try to hurt myself.

21:26.023 --> 21:27.824
She just wants to get rid of me.

21:27.859 --> 21:29.092
What have they said to you?

21:29.126 --> 21:31.795
Nothing. They're probably just afraid

21:31.829 --> 21:34.231
that I'll run away or...

21:34.265 --> 21:36.233
I don't know.

21:36.267 --> 21:38.835
Are you sure you're not just...

21:38.870 --> 21:41.805
What? Being paranoid?

21:41.839 --> 21:43.740
Because I'm crazy?

21:43.774 --> 21:44.975
You're not crazy.

21:45.009 --> 21:46.877
They're always whispering, okay?

21:46.911 --> 21:50.080
And when I walk into the
room, they shut right up.

21:50.114 --> 21:52.649
There was a girl that
I met in the hospital.

21:52.683 --> 21:55.819
Her parents sent her to one
of those schools in Montana,

21:55.853 --> 21:57.988
and she said it was like a prison.

21:58.022 --> 22:00.023
Can you please talk to my mom?

22:00.057 --> 22:01.992
Talk to me about what?

22:07.832 --> 22:09.866
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

22:09.901 --> 22:12.636
Oh, it's okay. I understand.

22:12.670 --> 22:14.738
I'm embarrassed too.

22:14.772 --> 22:17.641
I caused my family a lot of heartache.

22:17.675 --> 22:20.510
Want to know a secret?

22:20.544 --> 22:22.646
I've been walking around
the block for an hour,

22:22.680 --> 22:24.648
trying to get the courage up

22:24.682 --> 22:26.616
to show my face in there.

22:26.651 --> 22:29.819
I'm not even sure my
brothers will speak to me.

22:29.854 --> 22:31.788
But, Mariana,

22:31.822 --> 22:34.357
I'm the only one who needs to feel ashamed.

22:34.392 --> 22:36.493
I'm the one who did all
the bad things, not you.

22:36.527 --> 22:39.329
You and Jesus are pure and innocent,

22:39.363 --> 22:41.431
and no one in there is judging you.

22:43.534 --> 22:45.302
I'm not innocent.

22:45.336 --> 22:46.736
Of course you are. You did nothing wrong.

22:46.771 --> 22:48.438
Yes, I did.

22:48.472 --> 22:49.539
Mariana.

22:49.573 --> 22:53.610
I had sex for the first time,

22:53.644 --> 22:56.146
and not with Mat.

22:57.281 --> 23:00.450
So, anybody following the playoffs?

23:00.484 --> 23:04.187
Mm, Miami's my team, but since LeBron left,

23:04.221 --> 23:06.222
it's been a miserable season.

23:06.257 --> 23:09.092
Yeah. How about you, Donald?
Who do you like in the finals?

23:09.126 --> 23:10.327
Truth is, I'm not much of a sports fan.

23:10.361 --> 23:12.195
Me neither.

23:12.229 --> 23:14.431
So, Donald, what you do for a living?

23:14.465 --> 23:17.367
- I'm a mechanic.
- Oh, nice. You been doing that a long time?

23:17.401 --> 23:20.403
No, I was in commercial
real estate before that.

23:20.438 --> 23:23.206
So am I. We probably know
some of the same people.

23:23.240 --> 23:25.241
I doubt it.

23:25.276 --> 23:27.210
It was a while ago. It was...

23:27.244 --> 23:29.279
it was up in the Bay area.

23:29.313 --> 23:31.381
Adam: So why did you get out?

23:31.415 --> 23:33.283
The grind, you know.

23:33.317 --> 23:35.352
I'm just happier fixing cars.

23:35.431 --> 23:38.967
I hear you. Tough business, huh?

23:39.001 --> 23:42.070
It's not as tough as being
a cop though. Right, Mike?

23:42.104 --> 23:43.972
I don't know any different.

23:44.006 --> 23:47.008
You know, Stef's a cop too.

23:47.043 --> 23:49.110
Oh, yeah, yeah. No, of course.

23:49.145 --> 23:51.112
Well, I think pretty much any profession

23:51.147 --> 23:52.914
has its challenges, right?

23:53.983 --> 23:56.751
So where in the Bay area, Donald?

23:56.786 --> 23:58.720
I know a couple of guys up there.

23:58.754 --> 24:00.021
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:00.056 --> 24:02.057
Sorry, I'm really late.

24:04.093 --> 24:05.960
You look like hell.

24:05.995 --> 24:09.064
Thanks. Happy Father's Day.

24:11.934 --> 24:13.835
Okay, well, who did you have sex with?

24:13.869 --> 24:15.904
- Wyatt.
- And Wyatt is?

24:17.640 --> 24:19.574
(Crying) Callie's ex-boyfriend.

24:21.577 --> 24:24.879
I'm a terrible person,
and I feel like a slut.

24:24.914 --> 24:26.915
Don't you ever say that about yourself.

24:26.949 --> 24:28.917
I cheated on my boyfriend,

24:28.951 --> 24:31.920
and I lost my virginity to
a random boy I barely know.

24:31.954 --> 24:34.489
I'm pretty sure that makes me a slut.

24:34.523 --> 24:36.858
What if I get pregnant
at 15, just like you did?

24:36.892 --> 24:38.793
Did you use protection?

24:38.828 --> 24:40.528
A condom.

24:40.563 --> 24:43.465
But what if it had, like,
a hole in it or something?

24:43.499 --> 24:45.633
- I heard that happens.
- It's pretty unlikely.

24:45.668 --> 24:49.437
I just kind of want to
forget that it ever happened.

24:49.472 --> 24:52.373
Well, why do you think it did happen?

24:53.742 --> 24:56.411
Because Mat didn't want
to have sex with me,

24:56.445 --> 24:59.280
so he could hook up with girls on tour.

24:59.315 --> 25:01.549
Or he didn't want to just have sex with you

25:01.584 --> 25:03.585
your first time, and then leave.

25:03.675 --> 25:06.443
What teenage boy turns down sex?

25:06.478 --> 25:09.580
The good ones. The ones who care about you.

25:09.614 --> 25:11.348
The ones who don't want you to feel

25:11.383 --> 25:13.350
the way you're feeling right now.

25:15.320 --> 25:17.288
Do you think I should tell Callie?

25:21.626 --> 25:24.295
I don't know.

25:24.329 --> 25:27.398
But...

25:27.432 --> 25:29.466
You should probably tell your moms.

25:33.271 --> 25:37.374
I'll tell you one way I think
we're probably a lot alike.

25:37.409 --> 25:39.376
We probably judge ourselves

25:39.411 --> 25:41.979
way harsher than anyone judges us.

25:45.283 --> 25:47.885
So what do you say

25:47.919 --> 25:49.920
we go to this party together

25:49.955 --> 25:52.923
and trust that

25:52.958 --> 25:55.993
we can be forgiven for making mistakes?

25:58.897 --> 26:00.798
Okay.

(Seagulls cawing)

26:50.915 --> 26:52.650
When?

26:52.684 --> 26:55.452
Well, as soon as...

26:55.487 --> 26:57.855
We just wanted to have

26:57.889 --> 27:00.391
a nice Father's Day and...

27:00.425 --> 27:01.792
We were gonna tell you tomorrow.

27:01.826 --> 27:04.461
And where will I live?

27:04.496 --> 27:06.463
At home, with me.

27:06.498 --> 27:09.433
We have no intention
of sending you anywhere.

27:09.467 --> 27:11.535
And I'm so sorry, sweetie,

27:11.569 --> 27:13.537
you thought that's what was going on.

27:13.571 --> 27:15.506
And this is...

27:15.540 --> 27:17.308
it's just a separation, okay?

27:17.342 --> 27:19.343
We're not talking about a divorce here.

27:19.377 --> 27:22.212
Your father rented a house at the beach.

27:22.247 --> 27:24.415
You can see him anytime you want.

27:24.449 --> 27:26.350
Why can't I live with him?

27:26.384 --> 27:30.387
Sophia, your mother is
not responsible for this.

27:30.422 --> 27:33.490
We just need some time apart.

27:33.525 --> 27:35.326
Why?

27:35.360 --> 27:37.294
I mean, if you're not getting divorced,

27:37.329 --> 27:39.430
then why do you need time apart?

27:43.368 --> 27:46.337
Look, sometimes

27:46.371 --> 27:49.139
when you're not with someone,

27:49.174 --> 27:51.275
it helps you remember all
the reasons you want to be.

27:53.211 --> 27:56.180
They're still your mom and dad,

27:56.214 --> 27:58.315
and they still love you,

27:58.350 --> 28:01.318
and I love you.

28:01.353 --> 28:03.287
It's gonna be okay.

28:08.960 --> 28:12.162
I baked some cookies,
if anyone has room left.

28:12.197 --> 28:13.897
Not me. I ate like a horse.

28:13.932 --> 28:15.766
Yeah, everything was fantastic.

28:15.800 --> 28:17.868
- Mike: Thank you.
- It was really delicious. Thank you.

28:17.902 --> 28:21.071
How about a toast? To
our amazing hostesses.

28:21.106 --> 28:23.974
- Cheers.
- A toast to the amazing men in our lives.

28:25.443 --> 28:26.877
<i>Salud.</i>

28:26.911 --> 28:28.946
Brandon, would you like to be excused?

28:28.980 --> 28:31.882
- You look like you could use a nap.
- No, I'm good.

28:31.916 --> 28:34.084
Yeah, you look real tired.
Come on, I'll tuck you in.

28:34.152 --> 28:36.019
Stef: Aww, Daddy.

28:36.054 --> 28:38.655
All right.

28:38.690 --> 28:40.958
Please, don't get up. I'm
just gonna clear the dishes.

28:40.992 --> 28:43.060
Let me help you with that.

28:45.864 --> 28:47.698
Stef: Thanks, love.

28:47.732 --> 28:49.867
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Donald.

28:49.901 --> 28:53.504
So, Donald, are you
still in the same place?

28:53.538 --> 28:54.905
Oh, no, actually I had to move.

28:54.939 --> 28:57.574
I should probably give you my new address.

28:57.609 --> 28:59.810
Yeah, that'd be nice.
Nice to know where you are.

28:59.844 --> 29:01.712
Do you think Callie is gonna be home soon?

29:01.746 --> 29:03.647
I'd kind of love to see her.

29:03.681 --> 29:05.582
I'm sure she'd love to see you too,

29:05.617 --> 29:08.385
but she's probably gonna be late.

29:12.757 --> 29:14.625
Thanks, Adam.

29:14.659 --> 29:16.660
No problem. You're welcome.

29:16.694 --> 29:19.696
Listen, I've been doing some reading

29:19.731 --> 29:22.499
about, you know,

29:22.534 --> 29:25.636
kids Connor's age coming out.

29:25.670 --> 29:29.406
And, well,

29:29.441 --> 29:31.408
some L.G.B.T. experts say

29:31.443 --> 29:34.478
that it's better for kids to
wait till they get a little older

29:34.512 --> 29:36.480
to go public, you know,

29:36.514 --> 29:39.283
so they can better cope
with bullying and stuff

29:39.317 --> 29:42.286
in school and sports teams and all that.

29:42.320 --> 29:46.323
Well, that ship has sailed,
at least at Anchor Beach.

29:46.357 --> 29:48.325
But I can promise you

29:48.359 --> 29:51.328
we have a very strict no-bullying policy.

29:51.362 --> 29:53.564
What do you mean, that ship has sailed?

29:57.235 --> 29:58.435
Hey.

29:58.470 --> 30:01.338
So the whole school knows you're gay?

30:09.506 --> 30:11.101
Was it you? Are you the
one who told everybody?

30:11.102 --> 30:11.830
- No.
- No, we...

30:11.832 --> 30:13.377
- I got outed.
- By whom?

30:13.378 --> 30:14.099
I don't know.

30:14.124 --> 30:15.425
I'm sorry. I thought your father knew.

30:15.459 --> 30:17.093
What does that matter, Adam?

30:17.127 --> 30:19.429
'Cause I happen to care
what people think, okay?

30:19.463 --> 30:22.298
About you or your son?

30:22.522 --> 30:25.591
Well, it seems like it's
his business who knows.

30:25.626 --> 30:28.260
What, you want your
son getting bullied too?

30:28.295 --> 30:29.428
No.

30:29.593 --> 30:32.328
I want my son to be proud of who he is.

30:32.362 --> 30:34.663
Getting bullied at home
is worse than anything

30:34.698 --> 30:37.299
he's gonna face out in the world.

30:43.272 --> 30:45.206
That's not my intention.

30:47.176 --> 30:49.244
I know, Dad.

30:58.388 --> 31:00.356
Feeling better?

31:00.390 --> 31:01.757
Yeah, a little.

31:01.791 --> 31:03.592
Have a few drinks last night?

31:05.628 --> 31:07.563
- No.
- No?

31:07.597 --> 31:09.665
I think I know a hangover
when I see one, Brandon.

31:09.699 --> 31:11.567
Dad, I...

31:11.601 --> 31:13.736
Look, I get it. There's peer pressure,

31:13.770 --> 31:16.405
kids like to have parties.

31:16.439 --> 31:19.541
Brandon, there's a reason it's
illegal to drink before you're 21.

31:19.576 --> 31:21.477
Teenagers make bad decisions.

31:21.511 --> 31:23.445
They're not mature enough
to drink responsibly.

31:23.480 --> 31:25.414
I didn't even want to drink.

31:25.448 --> 31:27.549
I just...

31:27.584 --> 31:29.451
believe me, I regretted it.

31:29.486 --> 31:31.720
Well, at least you made one good decision.

31:31.755 --> 31:34.723
You didn't try to drive home last night.

31:34.758 --> 31:37.659
Look, how is Idyllwild otherwise?

31:37.694 --> 31:41.463
Uh...

31:41.498 --> 31:42.698
It's intense.

31:42.732 --> 31:44.299
I don't know.

31:44.334 --> 31:46.535
The people are so competitive.

31:46.569 --> 31:48.604
I thought I made a friend,

31:48.638 --> 31:52.408
but he ended up stabbing me in the back.

31:52.442 --> 31:55.444
You gotta rise above all that, you
know. Do your work, stay focused,

31:55.478 --> 31:57.546
don't get involved in the petty stuff.

31:57.580 --> 31:59.982
Yeah.

32:00.497 --> 32:02.598
Hey, can I ask you something?

32:02.632 --> 32:05.501
Mm.

32:05.535 --> 32:10.205
How would you feel
about me fostering a kid?

32:15.178 --> 32:16.211
B?

32:37.300 --> 32:39.501
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah?

32:39.536 --> 32:42.171
I love you.

32:46.409 --> 32:48.210
Love you.

32:51.147 --> 32:52.447
Thanks for coming.

32:52.482 --> 32:54.449
Thanks for the invitation.

32:54.484 --> 32:57.386
It meant a lot, Jude.

32:57.420 --> 33:00.255
You know,

33:00.290 --> 33:02.257
it's not good for any of us

33:02.292 --> 33:04.326
to keep secrets about who we are.

33:04.360 --> 33:07.362
And you have everything to be proud of,

33:07.397 --> 33:09.264
except me.

33:09.299 --> 33:11.934
If you don't want to tell
people where I've been

33:11.968 --> 33:14.269
and what I've done, that's okay.

33:14.304 --> 33:16.271
You don't have to.

33:16.306 --> 33:18.073
But you don't have to protect me either.

33:18.107 --> 33:21.109
You know, my story...
it's part of your story.

33:21.144 --> 33:23.278
You want to tell it... you got every right.

33:23.313 --> 33:26.215
I just...

33:26.249 --> 33:29.318
Just want to let you
know I'm okay with that.

33:37.160 --> 33:39.061
Can we stay in touch?

33:39.095 --> 33:41.129
Yeah, you bet.

33:44.867 --> 33:47.936
Hey, there's Callie.

33:47.971 --> 33:49.938
Hey.

33:49.973 --> 33:52.174
Donald, this is Robert.

34:04.053 --> 34:05.921
It's nice to meet you, Donald.

34:07.824 --> 34:09.925
You too.

34:13.862 --> 34:15.931
I have to get a bus.

34:15.965 --> 34:18.065
Don't want to miss it.

34:26.141 --> 34:28.844
In case you forgot,

34:28.878 --> 34:33.081
Donald was there for you when he wasn't.

34:33.116 --> 34:35.984
And he's just as much
your dad as he is mine.

34:50.915 --> 34:53.784
- Thanks for today.
- Yeah, hold on.

34:55.587 --> 34:57.521
Sit down. I want to talk to you.

35:03.494 --> 35:06.396
Um...

35:06.431 --> 35:10.201
Okay, look, I understand
that you're angry with Donald.

35:10.235 --> 35:13.103
But Jude's right. He
was there when I wasn't.

35:13.138 --> 35:16.307
Because he pretended he was my
father, and he never told you about me.

35:16.341 --> 35:18.275
I'm sure he was just
respecting your mother's wishes,

35:18.310 --> 35:20.377
and he didn't just pretend to
be your father, he raised you.

35:20.412 --> 35:23.180
He killed my mother. It's
his fault that she's dead.

35:23.215 --> 35:25.115
He made a mistake.

35:26.985 --> 35:30.054
All right, it was a
terrible, horrible mistake.

35:30.088 --> 35:32.056
He never should have
gotten behind the wheel,

35:32.090 --> 35:34.325
but your mother never should have
gotten in that car with him either.

35:34.359 --> 35:36.327
- So now it's her fault?
- No, it's not.

35:36.361 --> 35:38.963
But we've all made mistakes.

35:38.997 --> 35:41.999
The only difference is how
much suffering they cause.

35:42.033 --> 35:43.868
Donald... he might be out of prison,

35:43.902 --> 35:45.970
but he will never be free of that guilt

35:46.004 --> 35:48.138
and that remorse.

35:48.173 --> 35:50.241
Can you imagine that?

35:50.275 --> 35:52.243
He still could have fought for us.

35:55.280 --> 35:57.214
Look, I had...

36:01.186 --> 36:03.053
I was unfaithful to Jill.

36:03.088 --> 36:06.023
That's why we're separating.

36:06.057 --> 36:08.859
I was selfish,

36:08.894 --> 36:11.996
I broke my promise, and
I hurt her very much.

36:17.068 --> 36:21.105
I think I've been telling
myself all this time

36:21.139 --> 36:23.741
that it was your mother

36:23.775 --> 36:25.876
that was the love of my life.

36:25.911 --> 36:27.912
And I think sometimes I treated Jill

36:27.946 --> 36:30.681
like something I settled for.

36:33.818 --> 36:35.786
But the way she stood by me

36:35.820 --> 36:37.788
when you came into our lives,

36:37.822 --> 36:39.957
with her love and
support, it made me realize

36:39.991 --> 36:42.626
that she is...

36:42.661 --> 36:45.696
everything.

36:46.998 --> 36:51.568
She's the love of my life,

36:51.603 --> 36:53.837
along with Sophia, and now you.

36:56.641 --> 36:59.610
And I was very foolish not to see that.

37:03.581 --> 37:05.950
My point is,

37:05.984 --> 37:09.820
I am not a better man than Donald.

37:09.854 --> 37:12.456
I'm just luckier.

37:17.595 --> 37:19.697
So, you a cop too?

37:19.731 --> 37:21.432
Actually, I am.

37:21.466 --> 37:23.867
Callie's foster mom and I are partners,

37:23.902 --> 37:26.670
and... we used to be married.

37:26.705 --> 37:29.440
Sounds complicated.

37:29.474 --> 37:31.542
No, it's good, you know?

37:31.576 --> 37:34.411
Stef and her wife are
gonna adopt Callie, so...

37:34.446 --> 37:35.679
What?

37:35.714 --> 37:38.449
Like, Callie has two moms?

37:38.483 --> 37:39.717
Yep.

37:39.751 --> 37:41.719
Like you said, it's complicated.

37:41.753 --> 37:45.456
I don't know. Having two
moms sounds kind of cool.

37:45.490 --> 37:46.690
So where's yours?

37:46.725 --> 37:48.692
She's in a institution.

37:48.727 --> 37:50.728
She's mentally ill.

37:50.762 --> 37:53.564
And your dad?

37:53.598 --> 37:55.566
He's dead.

37:57.469 --> 37:58.802
I got a grandma.

37:58.837 --> 38:00.471
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:00.505 --> 38:02.473
She raised me and my brother, after.

38:02.507 --> 38:04.541
- Is she...
- She's alive.

38:04.576 --> 38:06.643
She's in a home. She's got dementia.

38:06.678 --> 38:09.680
She couldn't take care of us anymore,
so they put us in Foster care.

38:11.516 --> 38:13.684
Well, look, I ran your brother's
name through the system,

38:13.718 --> 38:15.786
and he hasn't been arrested.

38:19.457 --> 38:24.561
- That's good, right?
- If he's not in jail...

38:26.398 --> 38:28.365
Can you see if he's dead?

38:30.835 --> 38:32.803
'Cause he's all I got.

39:30.795 --> 39:32.763
So we have three birth uncles

39:32.797 --> 39:34.498
and eight birth cousins.

39:34.532 --> 39:35.766
- Wow.
- And everyone was super nice.

39:35.800 --> 39:38.635
They're all really close,
and super sweet to Ana too.

39:38.670 --> 39:41.371
Well, it sounds like everyone
had a really good Father's Day.

39:41.406 --> 39:43.540
And speaking of...

39:43.575 --> 39:44.741
Right.

39:48.746 --> 39:51.548
- Lena: Oh my gosh.
- Stef: Oh, what?

39:53.418 --> 39:55.452
Well, even though it's Father's Day...

39:55.487 --> 39:56.620
We wanted you to know...

39:56.654 --> 39:58.689
That we are grateful for all our mothers

39:58.723 --> 40:00.858
and fathers, but mostly...

40:00.892 --> 40:03.494
We're grateful for our parents.

40:03.561 --> 40:05.562
- Oh my gosh.
- Sounds like a card.

40:05.597 --> 40:07.564
(All giggle)

40:07.599 --> 40:09.800
That's very sweet. Did you rehearse that?

40:09.834 --> 40:12.436
- Mariana made us.
- And they loved it.

40:12.470 --> 40:13.637
They're from Jesus too.

40:13.671 --> 40:14.671
(Phone rings)

40:14.706 --> 40:17.441
- Oh, guys.
- I got it.

40:17.475 --> 40:19.443
Hello. Hey.

40:19.477 --> 40:21.578
What's up?

40:21.613 --> 40:23.780
You did? Okay.

40:23.815 --> 40:26.617
I don't know. A couple of weeks.

40:28.753 --> 40:31.421
I will ask her.

40:31.456 --> 40:33.423
Ask me what?

40:42.534 --> 40:43.834
Hey, Callie.

40:43.868 --> 40:46.637
Would you mind coming in
here for a second, please?

40:53.578 --> 40:55.646
Have a seat.

40:58.716 --> 41:00.450
What's going on?

41:00.485 --> 41:01.685
Well...

41:01.719 --> 41:05.389
Um, I went to juvie to talk with A.J.,

41:05.423 --> 41:08.425
and I've...

41:08.459 --> 41:10.627
we've decided I'm gonna foster him.

41:10.662 --> 41:12.579
Stef: Yeah, it's gonna take some time

41:12.580 --> 41:14.475
for Mike to get his license, so

41:14.576 --> 41:17.810
in the meantime, A.J.'s
gonna stay here with us.

41:17.911 --> 41:18.711
Okay?
