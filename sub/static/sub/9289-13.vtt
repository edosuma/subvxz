00:13.995 --> 00:16.866
Jack Bauer's interrogating
Syed Ali as we speak.

00:16.957 --> 00:21.500
We'll be informed of his progress on
a minute-by-minute basis, but nothing yet.

00:21.586 --> 00:24.256
We're certain he knows
the location of the bomb?

00:24.339 --> 00:25.419
Jack Bauer is.

00:25.619 --> 00:27.874
Make sure he has all
the resources he needs.

00:27.968 --> 00:31.301
They will kill your family
if you don't tell me where the bomb is.

00:31.388 --> 00:34.804
Where's the bomb?
Tell me where the bomb is!

00:34.891 --> 00:37.513
- Kill him.
- No! No!

00:38.395 --> 00:40.767
- I will tell you!
- Hold on!

00:40.856 --> 00:42.848
- It's Jack.
- What do you have?

00:42.941 --> 00:46.476
The bomb's at Norton Airfield.
They're gonna fly it over the city.

00:46.570 --> 00:49.736
Your meeting's changed. Now it's with me.

00:49.823 --> 00:54.200
So you're confirming that Roger Stanton
is involved? He knew about this bomb?

00:54.286 --> 00:57.322
Roger's more involved
than David could possibly know.

00:57.414 --> 00:59.703
I think you orchestrated all of this.

00:59.791 --> 01:03.789
You have your own and not the president's
best interest at heart.

01:03.879 --> 01:06.714
I got into a car accident.
I started running.

01:06.798 --> 01:09.372
Before I knew it, I had no idea where I was.

01:09.468 --> 01:12.089
I wanna get back to the highway
and get outta here.

01:12.179 --> 01:15.429
The highway's a couple of miles that way.

01:15.515 --> 01:20.261
But the way there is not safe at night.
My place is a half-mile that way.

01:20.353 --> 01:23.271
I can put a roof
over your head for the night.

01:23.356 --> 01:27.437
They've found Reza, haven't they?
They know what's happened.

01:27.527 --> 01:29.769
Tell me, please, what happened?

01:29.863 --> 01:34.739
You wouldn't understand, Kate.
People have to die for things to change.

02:00.102 --> 02:02.178
- This is Bauer.
- Jack, this is Tony.

02:02.270 --> 02:05.437
- You're about ten minutes from the airport?
- Yeah.

02:05.524 --> 02:09.308
- You got a tail number on the aircraft yet?
- Not yet.

02:09.401 --> 02:12.522
You'll link up with the assault team.

02:12.614 --> 02:15.022
They're starting to lock the grounds down.

02:15.117 --> 02:18.568
OK, that sounds good.
Tony, have you contacted Kim yet?

02:18.662 --> 02:21.773
No, I haven't. I called
the sheriffs station.

02:21.873 --> 02:23.952
They sent out search teams.

02:24.042 --> 02:26.498
I don't know why she hasn't contacted us.

02:26.586 --> 02:30.714
She can't go back to LA, and the LAPD's
looking for a murder suspect.

02:30.799 --> 02:34.797
She's not gonna reach out to us.
We've gotta find her. Understand?

02:34.886 --> 02:41.090
- I'm putting every resource on it.
- Do everything you have to. Thanks.

02:47.441 --> 02:50.607
- How much further is it?
- Not much.

02:52.821 --> 02:55.941
Ow. Ow! Damn it.

02:56.032 --> 02:58.358
Here, let me see that.

02:59.494 --> 03:01.736
We really ought to get you to a doctor.

03:01.830 --> 03:06.124
No, I told you, it's not safe for me in LA.

03:06.209 --> 03:10.456
Because people there think
you did something you didn't do?

03:10.547 --> 03:12.623
Yeah, that's right.

03:14.718 --> 03:17.754
- You don't believe me.
- It doesn't matter.

03:17.846 --> 03:22.009
You don't wanna go back to LA.
That's good enough for me.

03:23.018 --> 03:25.094
There it is.

03:59.513 --> 04:03.131
Ready to tell me everything I need to know?

04:06.520 --> 04:08.596
Continue.

04:09.564 --> 04:13.183
We knew about the bomb... weeks ago.

04:23.870 --> 04:26.278
Thank you, Simmons.

04:37.175 --> 04:39.666
What do you mean, "knew"?

04:40.387 --> 04:42.878
We let it in the country.

04:44.724 --> 04:47.560
Tracked it all the way.

04:49.438 --> 04:52.011
We allowed it to sneak through customs,

04:52.107 --> 04:57.350
and we allowed the Second Wave
terrorist cell

04:57.446 --> 05:00.565
to operate... unimpeded.

05:00.657 --> 05:03.113
God, Roger. A nuclear bomb?

05:03.201 --> 05:08.409
There's no chance that this bomb
is ever gonna go off.

05:08.498 --> 05:10.574
There never was.

05:10.667 --> 05:15.128
We had a Special Ops team
following it every step of the way.

05:15.213 --> 05:17.289
Colonel Samuels' team.

05:18.967 --> 05:22.917
The mission was to take
the bomb out of play...

05:24.890 --> 05:27.381
at the last possible moment.

05:27.476 --> 05:30.809
What are you trying to do?
Start a war with the Middle East?

05:33.273 --> 05:35.515
- No.
- Then what?

05:35.609 --> 05:39.357
Your defence policy is too passive.

05:39.446 --> 05:43.313
- You need more resources.
- You're trying to hijack my presidency.

05:43.408 --> 05:46.824
No, no, no. I'd like to give it some balls.

05:46.912 --> 05:52.072
You're gonna call your Special Ops team.
Tell them to secure the bomb. Now!

05:53.627 --> 05:57.292
They went dark three hours ago.

05:57.380 --> 06:03.466
Not accepting any new incoming
communications till the mission's complete.

06:03.553 --> 06:05.712
And where were they?

06:07.349 --> 06:09.507
Where were they?

06:10.435 --> 06:14.647
Norton Airfield... Los Angeles.

06:19.820 --> 06:23.485
The shower's in there.
You're welcome to use it.

06:24.324 --> 06:29.745
Try not to stay in there too long.
There's not a lot of hot water.

06:32.582 --> 06:36.912
There's some towels in there,
and I'll try and get you some clean clothes.

06:40.006 --> 06:42.332
The door has a lock.

06:42.426 --> 06:44.217
Thanks.

06:59.401 --> 07:01.559
I just got off the phone with Division.

07:01.653 --> 07:06.232
Syed Ali named three more
Second Wave terrorists in the LA area.

07:06.324 --> 07:09.824
I want two transport teams assigned
to each one. Pick 'em up now.

07:09.911 --> 07:11.619
OK.

07:16.460 --> 07:22.580
Hey, guys, heads up. They just received
a second confirmation from NSA in Oregon.

07:22.674 --> 07:25.675
The location of the bomb
is indeed Norton Airfield.

07:25.761 --> 07:30.469
Jack Bauer's en route. I want every
available field agent over there now.

07:53.288 --> 07:56.206
- This is Bauer.
- There's a new wrinkle, Jack.

07:56.291 --> 07:59.625
- How far are you from the airport?
- A couple of minutes.

07:59.711 --> 08:01.870
What kind of a wrinkle?

08:01.963 --> 08:07.918
There's a hostile US paramilitary unit
standing between you and the bomb.

08:08.011 --> 08:11.594
A Coral Snake team headed up
by Colonel Ron Samuels.

08:11.681 --> 08:15.097
It's the same unit that took out our plane.
What is going on?

08:15.185 --> 08:18.102
Why is a US military unit
aiding these terrorists?

08:18.188 --> 08:20.264
As far as we know, they're not.

08:20.357 --> 08:24.568
The best we can make out,
they wanna be the ones to secure the bomb.

08:24.653 --> 08:28.022
They'll treat anybody
who stands in their way as an adversary.

08:28.115 --> 08:31.069
Order Colonel Samuels
to tell his team to stand down.

08:31.159 --> 08:33.282
They went dark three hours ago.

08:33.370 --> 08:36.490
They're a rogue unit,
acting on their own authority.

08:36.581 --> 08:39.452
- How do I find them?
- I wish I could narrow it down.

08:39.543 --> 08:41.500
Just somewhere at the airport.

08:41.586 --> 08:45.002
I'm trying to get manpower
up from Camp Pendleton.

08:45.090 --> 08:46.549
This is bad, George.

08:46.633 --> 08:52.220
Yeah, it is. Our best bet is still
you getting past them to the bomb.

08:52.305 --> 08:54.381
Yes, I understand.

08:57.018 --> 08:59.426
What's happening?

08:59.521 --> 09:04.516
I don't know yet. CTU hasn't
been able to locate your sister.

09:04.609 --> 09:09.485
As soon as they do, they'll contact me. Sorry.
This is gonna take longer than I thought.

09:45.150 --> 09:46.348
Omar!

10:04.294 --> 10:06.750
Dispatch, this is 4827...

10:12.385 --> 10:14.259
Kate...

10:15.722 --> 10:17.861
You've seen terrible things today,

10:17.961 --> 10:21.227
but I need you a little longer,
in case we find your sister.

10:21.311 --> 10:23.600
Are you OK with that?

10:25.023 --> 10:27.977
- Agent Baker.
- Jack.

10:28.068 --> 10:31.852
Take Miss Warner to the secured area,
make sure she's comfortable.

10:31.947 --> 10:34.189
You'll need this.

10:34.282 --> 10:36.358
Thank you.

10:40.163 --> 10:43.947
Jack Bauer. Steve Goodrich.
I'm heading up the assault team on-site.

10:44.042 --> 10:47.162
I was told you have
further intel on the group?

10:47.254 --> 10:52.794
These are individual military records of
every soldier under Samuels' command.

10:52.884 --> 10:57.546
- What's our profile with them?
- They're gonna treat us like hostiles.

10:57.639 --> 11:00.675
- That doesn't make sense.
- No, but that's the situation.

11:00.767 --> 11:02.760
- Is your team ready?
- Inside.

11:02.853 --> 11:05.260
We got airport schematics.

11:05.355 --> 11:08.107
Good. Everybody gather round!

11:09.276 --> 11:12.941
We are going to be engaging hostiles
in a large uncontrolled area.

11:13.029 --> 11:16.695
I want everyone wearing
ID tags, no exceptions.

11:16.783 --> 11:19.737
Anybody wants to leave this area,
check with me first.

11:19.828 --> 11:23.197
- Who's got the schematics?
- Here, sir.

11:23.290 --> 11:28.117
Here's the situation: there is
a nuclear warhead somewhere on-site.

11:28.211 --> 11:31.461
There's an armed Delta team surrounding it.

11:31.548 --> 11:34.586
I want three sub-units.
Unit one will makes the first sweep.

11:34.786 --> 11:36.755
Unit two coordinates air tactical.

11:36.845 --> 11:41.306
Unit three will await my command as soon
as I've got a 20 on the bomb. Understand?

11:41.391 --> 11:42.850
Yes, sir.

11:44.144 --> 11:47.892
Good luck, gentlemen.
Lieutenant, set up your teams.

11:49.399 --> 11:54.061
Gentlemen, team A, B.
Column of two on me. Let's go.

12:06.458 --> 12:09.210
Bauer's set up the staging
area at the airfield.

12:09.294 --> 12:10.457
OK.

12:12.297 --> 12:15.168
- Tony, we got a little problem.
- What's up?

12:15.258 --> 12:17.928
Brad Hammond from Division is on his way.

12:18.011 --> 12:20.549
They want to shut us down
and run everything.

12:20.639 --> 12:22.216
We're up and running now.

12:22.307 --> 12:25.723
Not 100%. We're still having
intermittent packet loss.

12:25.811 --> 12:29.552
Division's uncomfortable with us
running this operation like this...

12:29.752 --> 12:31.564
out of a compromised location.

12:31.650 --> 12:36.608
We don't have the time to give these idiots
the grand tour. We're closing in on this.

12:36.696 --> 12:41.074
They're on their way,
so we just gotta deal with it.

13:19.114 --> 13:22.281
Hey. How you feeling?

13:22.367 --> 13:25.285
- A lot better. Thank you.
- Have a seat.

13:31.168 --> 13:34.916
So why is it that you
live up here like this?

13:35.005 --> 13:38.587
I don't know. I guess I just got
sick of the whole LA scene.

13:39.801 --> 13:43.419
It's not like I hate anyone there.
There's just too many people.

13:43.513 --> 13:46.087
Don't have that problem up here, huh?

13:46.183 --> 13:48.555
No, it's just the opposite.

13:48.643 --> 13:53.140
So, why don't you move to a small town?
Why do you have to be by yourself?

13:53.231 --> 13:55.224
I don't know.

13:55.317 --> 13:59.065
So, tell me again
why you can't go back to LA.

14:00.655 --> 14:04.107
If I told you, you wouldn't
believe me, so...

14:04.201 --> 14:06.656
What?

14:07.412 --> 14:12.869
My father works for the government.
A counter-terrorist unit.

14:12.959 --> 14:19.673
He said that someone's gonna detonate
a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles today.

14:19.758 --> 14:21.466
What's so funny?

14:21.551 --> 14:27.222
I knew it. I've been telling people
that this is gonna happen for over a year.

14:27.307 --> 14:29.798
No one would listen to me.

14:32.854 --> 14:36.188
So, you knew about these terrorists?

14:36.274 --> 14:40.901
Not these ones specifically, but yeah.

14:40.987 --> 14:44.257
Read the foreign papers.
Look over the fence.

14:44.357 --> 14:46.112
The whole world hates America.

14:46.201 --> 14:48.526
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

14:55.627 --> 14:59.245
Don't worry. We're far enough away.
We won't get hurt.

14:59.339 --> 15:02.542
No one's far enough away.
What about the fallout?

15:02.634 --> 15:07.426
No one can predict
where the wind's gonna take it.

15:07.514 --> 15:11.346
I'm gonna show you something,
but you can't tell anyone.

15:11.977 --> 15:14.053
What is it?

15:15.105 --> 15:17.181
After we eat.

15:25.449 --> 15:28.403
Where are we on locating
the Coral Snake commandos?

15:28.493 --> 15:30.782
Bauer and his teams are looking for them.

15:30.871 --> 15:34.785
- CTU is updating us every ten minutes.
- Good.

15:34.875 --> 15:37.330
This cannot possibly have a good outcome.

15:37.419 --> 15:42.247
We've got two highly trained
American military groups about to face off.

15:42.340 --> 15:44.298
CTU has a formable presence.

15:44.384 --> 15:49.093
If the commandos are there,
CTU should be able to control the situation.

15:49.181 --> 15:52.550
- Mr President, we've got something new.
- What?

15:52.642 --> 15:56.936
Our com team discovered a covert link
between Stanton and Bruce Gluck.

15:57.022 --> 15:59.098
- The Michigan senator?
- Yes.

15:59.191 --> 16:05.443
It looks like they were working together.
How would you like to proceed?

16:06.490 --> 16:09.740
Sherry knows Gluck and his key staffers.

16:09.826 --> 16:14.204
They worked closely together
during the primaries. Bring her in.

16:15.207 --> 16:17.745
Here? Into the OC?

16:17.834 --> 16:21.250
Yes. She'll need access
to our secure databases.

16:23.924 --> 16:27.708
- Sir, I feel I must...
- I don't wanna argue about this.

16:27.803 --> 16:30.210
Just do it.

16:49.282 --> 16:51.608
Why's it taking so long to get this number?

16:51.701 --> 16:54.489
Barely anything here. There's something...

16:54.579 --> 16:57.865
- We need this, Randy. Come on.
- I'm on it.

16:57.958 --> 17:01.020
They're sending Division
to do an evaluation.

17:01.055 --> 17:03.296
- Yeah
- Why are they doing this now?

17:03.380 --> 17:07.212
We're operational, getting results.
Why don't they leave us alone?

17:07.300 --> 17:12.258
They will. This is just Chapelle's
way of doing stuff over there.

17:14.558 --> 17:15.803
What about George?

17:15.892 --> 17:21.017
When they get a look at the shape he's in,
they're probably gonna yank him.

17:22.858 --> 17:26.771
I'm keeping an eye on him, all right?
Just get everyone to Norton.

17:44.963 --> 17:45.994
What have we got?

17:46.089 --> 17:50.502
Military-issue combat boots. Five sets,
all leading in here, less than an hour old.

17:50.594 --> 17:53.429
- Anything coming out?
- Still in there.

17:53.513 --> 17:56.183
Have your team ready to move on my signal.

19:47.043 --> 19:49.748
It's definitely Colonel Samuels' men.

19:49.838 --> 19:54.251
If these guys are dead,
who's tracking the bomb?

20:04.936 --> 20:08.981
This is Baker. Copy that.
We're moving into position now.

20:34.883 --> 20:38.631
This bank was knocked out,
but we didn't lose any data.

20:38.720 --> 20:41.211
The same data is mirrored at Division.

20:41.306 --> 20:45.256
We don't need to risk running
these operations from a jury-rigged system.

20:45.352 --> 20:48.187
You can't run a mission on data alone.

20:48.271 --> 20:52.221
My team has more experience
implementing than anyone at Division.

20:52.317 --> 20:56.529
I don't think that's true,
but the point is moot.

20:56.613 --> 20:59.531
Start to ship some of
your people to our offices.

20:59.616 --> 21:03.780
And waste an hour on transporting and
set up, with a nuclear bomb ticking away?

21:03.870 --> 21:06.492
I was wondering if this place
had a director.

21:06.581 --> 21:09.416
- Brad, good to see you.
- George.

21:11.878 --> 21:13.871
I heard you're not feeling well.

21:13.964 --> 21:16.502
I imagine you've heard
all kinds of things today.

21:16.591 --> 21:21.337
But a bad day for me is better than a good
day for anybody on your side of the freeway.

21:21.430 --> 21:23.339
- That right?
- We're not shutting down.

21:23.432 --> 21:26.516
We got way too many
active protocols in play here.

21:26.601 --> 21:29.057
Your systems failed
their checks this morning.

21:29.146 --> 21:31.352
This morning. Everything's fine now.

21:31.440 --> 21:36.682
Eileen, show Brad here how our systems
are exceeding all of their time horizons.

21:36.778 --> 21:38.237
Yes, sir.

21:38.321 --> 21:41.358
Think you can do that at Division?

21:41.450 --> 21:46.028
Don't believe everything
you hear, Brad. Thank you.

22:04.514 --> 22:07.266
- Come on.
- What is it?

22:07.350 --> 22:09.557
You'll see.

22:16.276 --> 22:20.060
- I'm not sure, Lonnie.
- Come on, don't be scared.

22:22.991 --> 22:25.067
Come on.

22:36.755 --> 22:39.044
Watch your head over here.

22:52.229 --> 22:54.305
It's a bomb shelter.

22:55.315 --> 23:00.143
Short of a direct hit, you could survive
down here for a pretty long time.

23:02.614 --> 23:05.532
- You did all this yourself?
- It took me two years.

23:05.617 --> 23:08.618
After I dug it out, it wasn't too bad.

23:08.703 --> 23:13.911
Hey, check it out.
I'm kind of a coffee junkie.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.666
I could pretty much handle anything,
but I gotta have my java.

23:17.754 --> 23:21.337
These beans are from Argentina.
Here, smell this.

23:22.843 --> 23:24.301
Wow.

23:24.386 --> 23:26.129
- That's great.
- The best.

23:26.221 --> 23:28.842
Mm, that's my favourite smell.

23:47.492 --> 23:49.568
Hey! Hey!

23:51.538 --> 23:53.946
Hey! Where are you going?

24:02.507 --> 24:04.381
Kim!

24:05.719 --> 24:07.795
What's wrong?

24:07.888 --> 24:12.051
I just got a little claustrophobic
down there, that's all.

24:12.142 --> 24:14.633
You're shaking. Are you OK?

24:15.353 --> 24:18.972
- I don't think I should be here, Lonnie.
- Why not?

24:19.065 --> 24:23.609
I don't know you, and you live here by
yourself with a bomb shelter with guns...

24:23.695 --> 24:29.034
Think about it, Kim. It's gonna be
people like me who'll survive today...

24:29.117 --> 24:31.608
if what you say is true.

24:34.372 --> 24:36.942
Sorry, I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

24:37.142 --> 24:38.121
You didn't.

24:38.210 --> 24:41.910
A lot has happened to me today,
and with the bomb in LA,

24:42.005 --> 24:46.714
I just think I need to go
to my Aunt Carol's to be with family.

24:54.351 --> 24:58.349
Whatever, Kim. If you gotta go, go.

25:20.085 --> 25:23.501
The green card will give you
access to the system rooms,

25:23.588 --> 25:26.708
and the red card will get you
into the network.

25:26.800 --> 25:28.045
Thank you, Lynne.

25:28.802 --> 25:32.752
I'm sorry you weren't able
to gain access to the OC earlier.

25:42.899 --> 25:45.307
What made the president change his mind?

25:45.402 --> 25:47.644
I'll let the president fill you in.

25:47.737 --> 25:51.486
I'd like to make it clear that
you are not to interface directly

25:51.575 --> 25:53.781
with the personnel once inside the OC.

25:53.869 --> 25:56.538
Please see me if you need anything.

25:56.621 --> 26:01.698
- You want me to run everything by you?
- I'm familiar with the internal politics.

26:01.793 --> 26:05.542
- I'd be able...
- You'll be able to do what, Lynne?

26:05.630 --> 26:08.501
I'm trying to maintain
some form of protocol.

26:08.592 --> 26:11.546
No, you're trying to position yourself

26:11.636 --> 26:14.887
between me and David's inner circle
because you don't trust me.

26:14.973 --> 26:19.849
Instead of talking about protocols, just say
what's on your mind. You don't want me here.

26:19.936 --> 26:22.427
- Mrs Palmer...
- No, you don't me here.

26:22.522 --> 26:24.431
So let's just quit playing games.

26:24.524 --> 26:28.107
How dare you speak to me like this.

26:28.195 --> 26:33.818
I was appointed by the president because
of my qualifications in foreign policy.

26:33.909 --> 26:37.657
I don't know what makes you think
you can lecture me.

26:37.746 --> 26:40.700
Fine. You don't wanna play games?

26:40.791 --> 26:44.076
I don't like you.
And I don't like you being here.

26:49.716 --> 26:52.385
Now we're communicating.

27:22.374 --> 27:26.158
All right. You should have
everything you need here.

27:26.253 --> 27:29.918
- Thanks. I'll get it back to you.
- Don't worry about it.

27:30.006 --> 27:33.210
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

27:33.301 --> 27:36.635
Stay close to me.
It's a 15-minute walk to the highway.

27:38.348 --> 27:40.886
- What was that?
- I don't know.

27:43.562 --> 27:46.432
It's Mike Kramer, the park ranger.

27:47.566 --> 27:50.769
He's probably looking for you.

27:50.861 --> 27:53.648
The police probably called him.

27:54.823 --> 27:58.821
- What do you want me to do?
- They're gonna send me back to LA.

28:04.875 --> 28:07.200
Lonnie.

28:07.294 --> 28:09.167
Hey, Mike.

28:11.673 --> 28:14.378
- What's up?
- Following up on a missing person's call.

28:14.468 --> 28:17.338
- Seen anyone tonight?
- No. Who are you looking for?

28:17.429 --> 28:20.762
A teenage girl.
She ran away from a car accident.

28:20.849 --> 28:26.305
- Why would they be looking out here?
- Cos she was in custody.

28:26.396 --> 28:29.979
- In custody? For what?
- Kidnapping and murder.

28:30.066 --> 28:31.726
Wow.

28:40.160 --> 28:42.449
- You got company?
- What? No, no.

28:42.537 --> 28:45.408
Doug came by earlier.
I haven't cleaned up yet.

28:45.499 --> 28:48.203
- Doug O'Keefe from the fire district?
- Yeah.

28:48.293 --> 28:52.836
- I heard he was still mad after last week.
- It was just a card game.

28:52.923 --> 28:55.414
You emptied his wallet.

29:00.097 --> 29:02.552
- Keep your eyes open, OK?
- I will.

29:02.641 --> 29:04.717
I'll see ya, pal.

29:14.319 --> 29:17.439
- Don't worry. He's gone.
- Thank you.

29:23.453 --> 29:26.288
Kidnapping? Murder?

29:26.957 --> 29:29.329
I didn't do it, I swear.

29:32.879 --> 29:36.829
Can we hang out here for a few more minutes,
till he clears the area?

29:36.925 --> 29:39.498
Yeah, I think it's a good idea.

29:42.722 --> 29:44.798
Hey, Lonnie?

29:47.185 --> 29:53.555
I'm really lucky that you were here.
You've been a really good friend. Thank you.

29:57.362 --> 30:00.446
Find out about Glock's relationship
with Stanton.

30:00.532 --> 30:04.909
I'm interested in any meetings that
both Rayburn and Stanton attended.

30:04.995 --> 30:07.700
Fine. I know exactly who to call.

30:07.789 --> 30:11.205
Good. I'll have Lynne
set you up with a work space.

30:11.293 --> 30:16.251
That's great.
Lynne's been quite helpful. I...

30:17.466 --> 30:20.217
- I wanna thank you, David.
- For what?

30:20.302 --> 30:23.338
I know how difficult it is
to get clearance in here,

30:23.430 --> 30:26.003
and I'm certain your
advisors don't want me...

30:26.099 --> 30:29.433
Sherry, stop distilling
everything down to politics.

30:30.312 --> 30:34.309
We have a need for information.
Hopefully you can fill it.

30:34.399 --> 30:38.349
And I will... Mr President.

30:39.237 --> 30:41.693
Sherry, I'm sorry.

30:43.116 --> 30:47.328
I didn't mean to sound rude.
I really do appreciate what you're doing.

30:47.412 --> 30:49.784
That's why you're here.

30:50.123 --> 30:51.665
Mr President.

30:51.750 --> 30:55.961
- Yes, Mike.
- I just got off with CTU Los Angeles.

30:56.046 --> 30:58.881
Jack Bauer found
the Coral Snake commandos.

30:58.965 --> 31:02.132
- So it's over?
- I'm afraid not.

31:02.219 --> 31:07.461
All six members of the team
had been killed before Bauer got there.

31:07.557 --> 31:10.048
What about the bomb?

31:21.113 --> 31:24.861
Roger, your men are all dead,
and there's no sign of the bomb.

31:26.910 --> 31:29.033
That's not possible.

31:29.121 --> 31:31.612
Your insane plan backfired.

31:31.706 --> 31:36.250
Those men were our last chance to
find the bomb, and now they're dead.

31:36.336 --> 31:38.127
My God.

31:38.213 --> 31:42.875
You're misguided, but you are not crazy.
You do not want this bomb to go off!

31:42.968 --> 31:43.999
Of course not.

31:44.094 --> 31:47.095
Then tell me, who else
could have known about this?

31:48.682 --> 31:50.805
No one. They were on their own.

31:50.892 --> 31:53.727
Somebody killed
six highly trained commandos.

31:53.812 --> 31:56.647
That's not the work of
a bunch of suicide bombers!

31:56.731 --> 31:59.353
- Six commandos?
- That's right.

32:00.318 --> 32:02.525
There were seven.

32:04.781 --> 32:09.194
- What's the word at the airport?
- There's too many places it could be.

32:09.286 --> 32:14.280
Got it. It's either N34G5, or it's N34G6.

32:14.374 --> 32:17.328
- Michelle.
- I'm on it.

32:17.419 --> 32:23.172
N34G5. It's registered in California,
and it's at Norton Airport, hangar MD7.

32:23.258 --> 32:25.334
Get Bauer.

32:25.969 --> 32:29.552
Down the runway to here,
then to these hangars all down here.

32:32.976 --> 32:34.470
- Bauer.
- It's Tony.

32:34.561 --> 32:35.938
We got a tail number on that plane.

32:36.121 --> 32:39.437
N as in "November", three,
four, G as in "golf", five.

32:39.524 --> 32:44.270
The FAA has got it spotted in hangar M
as in "mama", D as in "delta", seven.

32:44.362 --> 32:46.770
OK. We got it. Let's go.

32:49.785 --> 32:53.652
Hangar MD7 at the other end of the airport.

34:03.316 --> 34:05.558
The third hangar from the end.

34:05.652 --> 34:07.194
There it is! Go, go!

34:13.534 --> 34:17.782
He's trying to make a run for the north
runway. Send a team over to cut him off!

34:43.190 --> 34:45.811
Pull up alongside of him!

35:07.964 --> 35:10.040
Damn it!

35:18.475 --> 35:22.307
The pilot has been hit!
The pilot has been hit!

35:44.376 --> 35:46.452
Put your hands in the air!

35:46.545 --> 35:51.670
Put your hands up!
Put your hands above your head!

35:54.761 --> 35:57.003
Keep your hands up!

36:00.767 --> 36:05.097
He's got it in the plane!
Get the nuke emergency team here now!

36:19.786 --> 36:24.662
You're clear until the threat passes.
When it does, we're gonna re-evaluate.

36:24.749 --> 36:26.493
Fine.

36:27.252 --> 36:30.336
See somebody about that cough.
You don't look so good.

36:30.422 --> 36:33.209
Appreciate your concern, Brad.

36:49.191 --> 36:52.357
Lonnie, what are you doing?
What are you listening to?

36:52.444 --> 36:57.604
Police band. I'm just scanning to see
if there's anything about your APB.

36:57.699 --> 37:02.824
I'd hate to get you out there and then find out
there's a roadblock and a bunch of cop cars.

37:02.913 --> 37:05.617
- Find anything?
- Nothing yet.

37:05.707 --> 37:07.451
Good.

37:07.542 --> 37:11.789
Looks like you're not gonna
make the Ten Most Wanted.

37:16.635 --> 37:19.422
- Oh, my God.
- What?

37:20.055 --> 37:21.632
Wait, wait.

37:24.935 --> 37:27.936
- It can't be.
- What is it? What's wrong?

37:28.021 --> 37:31.472
- It happened.
- What? The bomb went off?

37:31.566 --> 37:36.228
All the LA stations went to static.
Ventura County's talking about a flash.

37:36.321 --> 37:39.192
- Now they're gone.
- I don't see anything.

37:40.575 --> 37:42.817
Here, here. Listen for yourself.

37:45.831 --> 37:49.698
This station, nothing. This one, nothing.

37:49.793 --> 37:52.628
This one, nothing. They're all dead.

37:52.712 --> 37:55.832
- I gotta get to my dad.
- No, we can't stay up here.

37:55.924 --> 37:58.545
- The radiation. We gotta get down below.
- No!

37:58.635 --> 38:02.847
We gotta go now, before it's too late.
Come on.

38:02.931 --> 38:04.010
OK.

38:29.958 --> 38:32.200
This is Paul Tate live from the Skywatch.

38:32.294 --> 38:35.828
A beautiful night in Los Angeles
as we near the nine o'clock hour.

38:35.922 --> 38:38.294
Traffic is light in both directions.

38:39.384 --> 38:42.800
- Try the internal.
- Give it to me.

38:46.057 --> 38:48.263
It's no good, either. It's no good.

38:48.463 --> 38:51.300
This trigger's been set
to permanent default.

38:51.396 --> 38:54.812
We can try the internal configuration.

38:56.109 --> 38:59.774
- What's going on?
- They wiped out the configurations.

38:59.863 --> 39:03.481
- Can you disarm it?
- It doesn't look good.

39:03.575 --> 39:07.489
Team A, this is Bauer. I want you
to start to clear the north runway.

39:07.579 --> 39:10.746
- I repeat: clear the north runway.
- What do you mean?

39:10.832 --> 39:14.533
If we can't diffuse it, I've gotta get it
as far away from LA as possible.

39:14.628 --> 39:18.079
- Yes, that's affirmative.
- Roger that.

39:27.516 --> 39:28.595
What's happening?

39:28.683 --> 39:32.847
Timing mechanism.
They must've given it an expedite command.

39:32.938 --> 39:36.141
When it's tampered with,
the countdown speeds up.

39:40.821 --> 39:42.897
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

39:51.289 --> 39:54.705
Wait a minute. Don't touch that.
It'll detonate.

40:02.384 --> 40:03.759
What just happened?

40:03.844 --> 40:07.544
Nothing. This isn't a bomb.
It's been rigged to look like one.

40:07.639 --> 40:10.426
- And the radiation reading?
- Probably the box.

40:10.517 --> 40:13.601
There was a bomb in here recently,
but it's gone now.

40:13.687 --> 40:17.519
The reading's picking up
some plutonium residue.

40:17.607 --> 40:21.522
All teams, we do not have the bomb.
This is a decoy.

40:21.611 --> 40:24.316
I repeat: we do not have the bomb.
This is a decoy.

40:24.406 --> 40:28.238
We are still looking for the nuclear device.

41:12.245 --> 41:15.163
There's no bomb at the airport, Roger.

41:20.378 --> 41:25.373
If there's something that you haven't
told me that could save lives...

41:27.761 --> 41:30.299
tell me now.

41:34.976 --> 41:36.803
Please, Roger.

41:40.774 --> 41:43.099
Ask Sherry.

41:44.945 --> 41:47.233
What did you say?

41:47.322 --> 41:52.280
Sherry... is the one you wanna talk to.
