to the finals,

06:26.260 --> 06:29.060

how much you win?

06:29.070 --> 06:30.000
- I win $1 million.
- Exactly.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.090

06:32.100 --> 06:34.070
- But guess what.
- Tell me.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.230
- Instead of getting
$1 million...

06:36.240 --> 06:37.230
- Yes?

06:37.240 --> 06:40.070
- Instead, I would want
1 million LEGOs.

06:56.130 --> 06:59.020

called ADHD?

07:10.200 --> 07:12.270
If you don't know
what that stands for,

07:12.280 --> 07:16.210
it's Attention Deficit
Hyper--

07:16.220 --> 07:19.210
Oh, hey, hey, hey, man.

07:19.220 --> 07:22.050

07:24.070 --> 07:27.250
Now, folks,
I might be only six,

07:27.260 --> 07:30.000
but I think I know a thing
or two about girls.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.260
but I think I know a thing
or two about girls.

07:31.270 --> 07:35.120
- Whoa!

07:35.130 --> 07:37.130
- Do tell.
- An important thing

07:37.140 --> 07:41.060
to know about girls
is that they say one thing

07:41.070 --> 07:43.270
but always mean another.

07:43.280 --> 07:46.110
- That's true.

07:46.120 --> 07:48.030
- My mom,
for instance,

07:48.040 --> 07:51.160
she always tells me
to call her Mom,

07:51.170 --> 07:56.030
and I come find out
that's not even her real name.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.000
What? Pssssh!

08:00.000 --> 08:01.050
What? Pssssh!

08:09.220 --> 08:12.090
- They're on their feet.

08:15.100 --> 08:17.080
- Yeah.

08:17.090 --> 08:20.090

08:20.100 --> 08:24.260
Let me go, because she likes
a belly laugh, Mel.

08:24.270 --> 08:26.000

08:26.010 --> 08:28.180
I don't think
I could stop laughing.

08:28.190 --> 08:30.000

how funny you are, Nathan?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.020
Do you realize
how funny you are, Nathan?

08:31.030 --> 08:32.020
- No.

08:34.080 --> 08:38.140

to another...

08:38.150 --> 08:40.100

08:40.110 --> 08:42.000

don't you?

08:46.030 --> 08:47.100

08:55.040 --> 08:58.270

08:58.280 --> 09:00.000
You're supposed
to get a girlfriend

09:00.000 --> 09:00.160
You're supposed

12 or 15th grade.

09:05.090 --> 09:06.260
- Who writes the material?

09:06.270 --> 09:08.170
- Well, Mom doesn't write them.

09:08.180 --> 09:09.280
She types them.

09:09.290 --> 09:11.050
I just--

09:11.060 --> 09:14.240

09:30.040 --> 09:31.130

09:31.140 --> 09:32.290

09:33.000 --> 09:34.110

you're a real character,

09:36.030 --> 09:38.030
and I think America's gonna
fall in love with you.

09:38.040 --> 09:40.020
I've got a feeling about that.

09:40.030 --> 09:42.000
- Thank you.

09:42.010 --> 09:43.190

we have to vote to see

09:43.200 --> 09:46.110

to your box of LEGO,

09:46.120 --> 09:48.010
which we agreed on, by the way.

09:48.020 --> 09:49.090
Howie?

09:49.100 --> 09:51.180
- Oh, he is one step
closer to a million LEGOs.

09:51.190 --> 09:53.230
It's a yes.

09:53.240 --> 09:57.090
- One yes!
- One down. Mel?

09:57.100 --> 10:00.000
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Two yeses, yay.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.030
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Two yeses, yay.

10:01.040 --> 10:04.170
- Heidi?
- Yes.

10:04.180 --> 10:07.210
- Three yeses.

10:07.220 --> 10:10.290
- Okay, Nathan.
You've got three yeses,

10:11.000 --> 10:13.150
and now you have four yeses.

10:13.160 --> 10:15.250
- ♪ Baby, baby, baby ♪

10:15.260 --> 10:19.140
♪ Ooh, like,
baby, baby, baby ♪

10:19.150 --> 10:21.270
♪ No, like,
baby, baby, baby ♪

10:21.280 --> 10:24.070
- Well done.

10:24.080 --> 10:25.170
- See you in the next round.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.000
- ♪ Baby, baby, baby, ooh... ♪

10:30.000 --> 10:31.020
- ♪ Baby, baby, baby, ooh... ♪

10:31.030 --> 10:33.060
- All right!
- Are you kidding me?

10:33.070 --> 10:36.040
That's amazing.
- You did so good there.

10:36.050 --> 10:38.240
You killed them.
Four yeses!

10:38.250 --> 10:40.170
- That's amazing.
- It is shocking to me...

10:40.180 --> 10:41.230
- It's amazing.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.050
- How he can just stand there

10:43.060 --> 10:45.000
at six years old
with all these people.

10:45.010 --> 10:46.220
- That kid,
if nothing else,

10:46.230 --> 10:48.290
will end up with
his own television series.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.180
- No. He's going
to own a TV network--

10:51.190 --> 10:52.290
- Yes.
- I just have a feeling--

10:53.000 --> 10:54.200
made of LEGO,
gold LEGO.

10:56.270 --> 10:59.170
- Awesome!

11:02.160 --> 11:05.210
- That is the most amazing thing
that I have seen, ever.

11:08.260 --> 11:10.170
- It's like being
in the happiest place,

11:10.180 --> 11:12.040
and I just didn't
want it to end.

11:12.050 --> 11:13.120
- Aah!

11:13.130 --> 11:15.160
- I can't.
I can't even watch it.

11:15.170 --> 11:19.060
- Oh, my God.

11:19.070 --> 11:22.020
- I'm gonna change your life
right now.

11:31.150 --> 11:34.010
- Welcome
to "America's Got Talent."

11:34.010 --> 11:35.050
- What do you do for a living?

11:35.060 --> 11:36.130
- I'm a singer.
- Great.

11:36.140 --> 11:37.140
What is your guys' talent?

11:37.150 --> 11:38.250
- Tap-dancing
- Tap-dancing?

11:38.260 --> 11:40.010
- We're here
to see Simon Cowell.

11:40.020 --> 11:42.220
- Imagine winning
a million dollars.

11:42.230 --> 11:45.140
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

11:45.150 --> 11:47.100
- Now let's go out
on this stage,

11:47.110 --> 11:49.290
and let's do
what we came here to do.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.100
- I am so glad
that you're with me.

11:51.110 --> 11:54.260
If I was alone,
I would be so scared right now.

11:54.270 --> 11:57.280
- I wouldn't want
to do this without you.

11:57.290 --> 11:57.954
- My dance partner
is beautiful, graceful,

11:57.954 --> 12:01.220
- My dance partner
is beautiful, graceful,

12:01.230 --> 12:04.020
and I love her.

12:04.030 --> 12:05.150
Carrie, what do you think?

12:07.260 --> 12:09.120
I'm José.

12:09.130 --> 12:11.240
This is my dog, Carrie,

12:11.250 --> 12:14.280
and we dance together.

12:14.290 --> 12:18.160
Carrie is the best dancing dog
on the world.

12:21.120 --> 12:23.130
She is the perfect partner.

12:23.140 --> 12:25.160
She's full of life.

12:27.010 --> 12:27.954
- This is Carrie?
- Yes.

12:27.954 --> 12:28.260
- This is Carrie?
- Yes.

12:28.270 --> 12:31.200
- Hey, do you see something
you like in there, Carrie?

12:34.080 --> 12:39.010
- When the judges see Carrie,
they will fall in love.

12:39.020 --> 12:40.150
- Go get 'em.

12:44.170 --> 12:47.130
- Aw.

12:47.140 --> 12:50.160
- Hello, guys.
Welcome to the show.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.080
- Thank you.
Hello.

12:52.090 --> 12:55.060
- What's your name, please?
- I'm José Fuentes.

12:55.070 --> 12:56.100
- And how old are you?

12:56.110 --> 12:57.954
- 58 years old.
- Oh, wow.

12:57.954 --> 12:58.170
- 58 years old.
- Oh, wow.

13:00.060 --> 13:01.080
- I'm very young, no?

13:02.220 --> 13:04.090
- What is your dog's name?

13:04.100 --> 13:05.260
- Her name is Carrie.

13:05.270 --> 13:07.010
- Carrie?

13:07.020 --> 13:08.200
And what are you
doing for us today?

13:08.210 --> 13:12.000
- Today we are going
to do dance.

13:13.130 --> 13:14.220
- How do you teach a dog
to dance?

13:14.230 --> 13:15.260
- Mm-mm-mm.

13:15.270 --> 13:18.110
- What got you
into dancing with Carrie?

13:18.120 --> 13:20.260
- I danced as a boy.

13:20.270 --> 13:25.150
My ex-wife
did not dance with me.

13:25.160 --> 13:27.954
- So you dance with Carrie.

13:27.954 --> 13:28.190
- So you dance with Carrie.

13:28.200 --> 13:31.040
- But Carrie is the best
partner dancer.

13:31.050 --> 13:33.170
- So you divorced your wife,

13:33.180 --> 13:35.010
who wouldn't dance with you--

13:35.020 --> 13:36.240
- Yes.
- And then bought a dog

13:36.250 --> 13:38.050
so that the dog...

13:39.070 --> 13:40.210
- Now I get it.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.110
That's why Carrie
is wearing a dress.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.200
- Got it.
Okay.

13:43.210 --> 13:46.120
This is gonna be
a really weird season.

13:47.140 --> 13:49.140
Good luck.
- Thank you.

13:54.270 --> 13:57.090
- That's a full-on dress.

14:11.110 --> 14:13.100
- Oh, that's cute.

15:13.080 --> 15:17.060
- Uh, José, so did
you have to teach Carrie,

15:17.070 --> 15:20.200
or did she just start dancing
on her own one day?

15:20.210 --> 15:23.140
- I like to dance with--
together.

15:23.150 --> 15:25.100
Together--and then,
together, dancing--

15:25.110 --> 15:26.130
- But that's why I'm asking.

15:26.140 --> 15:27.954
So one day, you just--

15:27.954 --> 15:28.000
So one day, you just--

15:28.010 --> 15:30.190
I'm laughing,
but it's great.

15:30.200 --> 15:34.100
So one day, you just discovered
that you could--

15:35.240 --> 15:38.250
What I'm trying to say
is that you found out one day

15:38.260 --> 15:41.150
that if you put
on a certain song--

15:43.230 --> 15:45.090
You started
dancing together, yes?

15:45.100 --> 15:46.180
- Yes.

15:46.190 --> 15:49.120
- Which is,
by the way, incredible.

15:49.130 --> 15:52.100
I mean, I would love my dog
to do the same thing.

15:54.100 --> 15:55.270
- Why would your wife
not do that?

15:58.220 --> 16:01.090
- I wasn't expecting that.
- What were you expecting?

16:01.100 --> 16:03.080
- You know, well,
he choreographed a routine,

16:03.090 --> 16:06.260
and Carrie, the dog,
followed and jumped it back

16:06.270 --> 16:08.170
and forward and around,

16:08.180 --> 16:10.210
and I actually really liked it.

16:13.060 --> 16:15.090
- I thought
it was very entertaining

16:15.100 --> 16:17.230
and a lot of fun
for the first 15 seconds,

16:17.240 --> 16:19.170
and then I felt myself--

16:19.180 --> 16:21.030
- Oh, come on.

16:21.040 --> 16:22.280
- But I'm telling you the truth.
That's what happened to me.

16:22.290 --> 16:23.280
- Come on.

16:25.120 --> 16:27.020
- Okay.
We've got to go.

16:27.030 --> 16:27.954
- Sock it to me.

16:27.954 --> 16:28.140
- Sock it to me.

16:32.030 --> 16:33.250
- I'm gonna say yes.

16:36.170 --> 16:38.020
Heidi?
- Sorry.

16:38.030 --> 16:39.250
I'm gonna give you a no.
- What?

16:41.270 --> 16:43.240
- Sorry.

16:43.250 --> 16:45.260
- Mel?
- I loved it. I enjoyed it.

16:45.270 --> 16:48.180
I'm gonna say yes.
- Howie?

16:48.190 --> 16:51.190
- It takes three yeses
to go on.

16:51.200 --> 16:54.010
- Come on, look how cute.

16:58.240 --> 17:02.070
- You know....

17:02.080 --> 17:03.070
Yes.

17:24.100 --> 17:25.190
- Welcome back to America.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.954
- Welcome back. Okay.
- Good job, Carrie.

17:27.954 --> 17:28.240
- Welcome back. Okay.
- Good job, Carrie.

17:28.250 --> 17:32.040
- I actually think the dog
liked dancing.

17:32.050 --> 17:33.150
- One day, they're just
sitting around the house.

17:33.160 --> 17:35.020
He looked at her.
She looked at him,

17:35.030 --> 17:36.220
and it was like,
"Let's dance."

17:36.230 --> 17:38.030
- Well, the wife's gone.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.200
- All right.
Congratulations.

17:39.210 --> 17:40.200
- Thank you.
- All right.

17:40.210 --> 17:41.200
- Bye.

17:41.210 --> 17:43.020
- Bye, Carrie.

17:56.190 --> 17:57.050
- All right.
Stand by, guys.

17:57.190 --> 17:58.180
Stand by.

17:58.190 --> 17:59.240
- Can we get the next act

17:59.250 --> 18:01.120
to the side
of the stage, please?

18:06.200 --> 18:09.260
- Get your mind focused.

18:09.270 --> 18:11.160
Let's do this.

18:13.030 --> 18:14.230
- I'm Amelie.
- And I'm Thommy.

18:14.240 --> 18:17.270
- And together,
we are the Clairvoyants.

18:17.280 --> 18:19.230
Five years ago,
we got introduced.

18:19.240 --> 18:19.936
From the beginning on, there was
a very special connection

18:19.936 --> 18:22.060
From the beginning on, there was
a very special connection

18:22.070 --> 18:25.000
between the two of us.

18:25.010 --> 18:28.140
Our minds crossed,
and our thoughts crossed.

18:29.270 --> 18:30.290
- As we started to date,

18:31.000 --> 18:33.240
more unusual things
started to happen.

18:33.250 --> 18:35.210
I mean, we had a lot
of phone calls, you know?

18:35.220 --> 18:37.250
And Amelie asked me once,

18:37.260 --> 18:40.020
"Hey, do you have
a red flower in your hand?"

18:40.030 --> 18:42.200
And I said, "Yes.

18:42.210 --> 18:44.210
How do you know that?"

18:44.220 --> 18:46.270
Amelie is able to feel things,

18:46.280 --> 18:49.180
objects, items
I'm holding in my hands.

18:49.190 --> 18:49.936
- Are you ready?
- I think so.

18:49.936 --> 18:52.070
- Are you ready?
- I think so.

18:52.080 --> 18:56.180
If we are not connected right,
the act goes wrong.

18:56.190 --> 18:57.220
- You guys ready?
- Yes.

18:57.230 --> 18:58.240
- We are ready.
Yes.

18:58.250 --> 19:01.000
Tonight we want
to surprise, amaze,

19:01.010 --> 19:02.210
and mystify America.

19:02.220 --> 19:05.040
- Let's get to it.

19:11.220 --> 19:12.250
- Hello.

19:12.260 --> 19:14.070
- Hi, guys.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.120
- Hi.
- How are you?

19:15.130 --> 19:16.200
- Very good.
- Give me your names, please.

19:16.210 --> 19:18.160
- I'm Thommy.
- And I'm Amelie.

19:18.170 --> 19:19.936
And together, we are
the Clairvoyants.

19:19.936 --> 19:20.290
And together, we are
the Clairvoyants.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.250
- Okay.

19:22.260 --> 19:24.140
Married?
- Not yet.

19:24.150 --> 19:27.050
- Not yet.
- Oh, she's waiting.

19:27.060 --> 19:28.150
- Hint, hint.

19:28.160 --> 19:31.190
- Is this something you do
full-time, the two of you?

19:31.200 --> 19:33.200
- We did it for our parents,
you know, in France,

19:33.210 --> 19:35.020
and they really liked it.
- Yeah.

19:35.030 --> 19:36.220
- And so we tried
to create an act,

19:36.230 --> 19:38.190
and we did it
in schools and colleges,

19:38.200 --> 19:40.020
and now, in the meanwhile,
people, you know,

19:40.030 --> 19:42.140
calling us,
and we can come to their,

19:42.150 --> 19:44.200
I don't know, parties
and stuff and perform.

19:44.210 --> 19:46.150
- And what brought you here?

19:46.160 --> 19:49.060
- Because we love what we do.

19:49.070 --> 19:49.936
We want to share our passion,
especially with America.

19:49.936 --> 19:51.240
We want to share our passion,
especially with America.

19:51.250 --> 19:54.190
- All right. Well, listen.
Best of luck, both of you.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.200
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

19:55.210 --> 19:56.200
- Thank you.

19:58.160 --> 20:00.240
- Before we start,
we need one thing.

20:00.250 --> 20:02.250
Heidi, do you have
your handbag

20:02.260 --> 20:04.010
with you?
- I do.

20:04.020 --> 20:05.190
- Ja, perfect.
- Ja.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.190
- Ja.
- Ja.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.250
- Heidi, please,
take your handbag

20:08.260 --> 20:10.110
and join us onstage.

20:10.120 --> 20:13.020
Give Heidi some encouragement.

20:19.110 --> 20:19.936
Every time
when we perform,

20:19.936 --> 20:21.130
Every time
when we perform,

20:21.140 --> 20:25.020
people think there must be
something in Amelie's ears,

20:25.030 --> 20:27.130
like, maybe a loudspeaker
or something.

20:27.140 --> 20:28.210
- So, to verify

20:28.220 --> 20:30.130
that there is nothing hidden,
check out my ears.

20:30.140 --> 20:32.150
If there are,
like, antennas, earphones,

20:32.160 --> 20:34.120
whatever--and my left ear.

20:34.130 --> 20:37.240
- No. A little mold,
but that's it. Just kidding.

20:37.250 --> 20:39.140
- Please inspect
this blindfold as well.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.260
I can take this for a second.

20:40.270 --> 20:43.100
And just make sure there is
nothing inside, nothing hidden,

20:43.110 --> 20:47.040
no Wi-Fi,
flat screens--no?

20:47.050 --> 20:48.150
- No.
- Hold it against your eyes,

20:48.160 --> 20:49.936
just for a second,
and just to confirm.

20:49.936 --> 20:50.200
just for a second,
and just to confirm.

20:50.210 --> 20:52.180
Can you see anything?
- Through it?

20:52.190 --> 20:53.180
- Yes.
- No.

20:53.190 --> 20:54.180
- Perfect.

20:54.190 --> 20:56.120
Now come to my right side,

20:56.130 --> 20:59.000
and look for one or two objects
out of your handbag,

20:59.010 --> 21:01.190
and it feels like there's
a lot of stuff inside.

21:04.200 --> 21:06.030
Whatever you like,

21:06.040 --> 21:10.080
and place it on my right hand.

21:12.230 --> 21:16.010
- Heidi already chose
something.

21:16.020 --> 21:17.040
It's a small object.

21:17.050 --> 21:19.110
You can open it.

21:19.120 --> 21:19.936
I quite like this shade.

21:19.936 --> 21:20.200
I quite like this shade.

21:20.210 --> 21:23.080
It's lipstick.

21:23.090 --> 21:24.240
- That's correct.
Yes.

21:24.250 --> 21:27.100
- There is a number on it.

21:27.110 --> 21:30.270
It's lipstick number 602.

21:30.280 --> 21:34.200
- Is that correct?
- That is correct.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.000
- What?
- That's amazing.

21:38.110 --> 21:41.020
Wow.

21:41.030 --> 21:43.170
- And now, ladies
and gentlemen, please,

21:43.180 --> 21:45.290
look in your pockets,
in your handbags,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.220
in your wallets
for any objects,

21:48.230 --> 21:49.936
any items
you brought with you tonight.

21:49.936 --> 21:50.200
any items
you brought with you tonight.

21:50.210 --> 21:52.200
Make it as difficult
as you like.

21:52.210 --> 21:55.130
Hold them up,
but do not say what it is.

21:55.140 --> 21:56.260
- Yes, because that is my job.

21:56.270 --> 21:59.100
- Let's start with this.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.220
- That feels like a cell phone.

22:00.230 --> 22:02.000
- So the color.
- It's white.

22:02.010 --> 22:03.030
- The brand.
- iPhone.

22:03.040 --> 22:04.060
- The provider?

22:04.070 --> 22:06.290
- That must be AT&T.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.220
- AT&T.
- It's correct?

22:08.230 --> 22:10.090
- Oh, I was right.

22:10.100 --> 22:12.140
- What?
- Thank you so much.

22:12.150 --> 22:14.140
A big round of applause
for Amelie. Thank you.

22:14.150 --> 22:16.270
- You didn't think that was
amazing? Did you just see that?

22:19.020 --> 22:19.936
- Simon,
can you just have a look?

22:19.936 --> 22:20.260
- Simon,
can you just have a look?

22:20.270 --> 22:23.070
There is, like,
no camera in my sleeves.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.070
- No.

22:24.080 --> 22:26.070
- Nothing on my jacket,
in my hair?

22:26.080 --> 22:27.150
- No.
- All good?

22:27.160 --> 22:28.150
- Yeah.
- Look again.

22:28.160 --> 22:30.220
Any objects, any items.

22:32.240 --> 22:35.010
- What about this one?

22:35.020 --> 22:38.190
You have something
in your hand that--

22:38.200 --> 22:42.060
there is liquid inside.

22:42.070 --> 22:43.220
I think these are

22:43.230 --> 22:47.030
kind of drops...
- No way.

22:47.040 --> 22:49.000
- And I'm pretty sure
those are eye drops

22:49.010 --> 22:49.936
- That is correct?
- That is absolutely correct.

22:49.936 --> 22:50.270
- That is correct?
- That is absolutely correct.

22:50.280 --> 22:55.080
- If you have a closer look,
there is an expiring date on it.

22:55.090 --> 22:56.110
- There's an expiration date?

22:56.120 --> 23:00.100
Yeah.
- They expire...

23:00.110 --> 23:03.200
That must be May 20...

23:03.210 --> 23:05.170
17.

23:05.180 --> 23:07.120
- That is correct.

23:07.130 --> 23:08.200
- Yes.

23:08.210 --> 23:12.080
- Yes, it is.

23:12.090 --> 23:15.050
Ladies and gentlemen, Amelie.

23:16.220 --> 23:19.240
- Are you kidding me?
That's fantastic.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.130
- Oh, my God.

23:35.030 --> 23:38.260
- Thank you.

23:38.270 --> 23:40.230
- Thank you so much.

23:40.240 --> 23:42.230
- I have to say,
I've been here for seven years.

23:42.240 --> 23:44.230
That is the most
amazing thing

23:44.240 --> 23:46.260
that I have seen, ever.

23:46.270 --> 23:49.936
I have eye drops I don't know
what the expiry date is.

23:49.936 --> 23:50.170
I have eye drops I don't know
what the expiry date is.

23:50.180 --> 23:52.050
- Now you know it.
- Amelie knows. Yeah.

23:52.060 --> 23:54.020
- It's the best,
most amazing thing

23:54.030 --> 23:56.220
I've ever seen
on "America's Got Talent."

24:01.060 --> 24:03.150
- I mean, I feel
like I'm stuck in some kind

24:03.160 --> 24:07.140
of crazy Twilight Zone
or something.

24:07.150 --> 24:10.260
That is a talent
beyond this planet.

24:10.270 --> 24:13.020
It's, like, alien-like
or something.

24:13.030 --> 24:14.240
It's crazy.

24:14.250 --> 24:15.260
- I'm floored too,

24:15.270 --> 24:17.130
because I know
I'm not in on it.

24:17.140 --> 24:19.170
I have no idea
how you did this.

24:19.180 --> 24:19.936
Absolutely incredible.

24:19.936 --> 24:21.020
Absolutely incredible.

24:21.030 --> 24:22.270
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you very much.

24:22.280 --> 24:26.020
- Thank you.

24:26.030 --> 24:28.230
- There is only
one explanation.

24:28.240 --> 24:30.230
You're a witch.

24:33.240 --> 24:35.010
It's like being
in "Bewitched."

24:35.020 --> 24:37.040
It's the most amazing feeling.

24:37.050 --> 24:39.120
You have magic powers, truly.

24:39.130 --> 24:40.170
Tell you what, Amelie,

24:40.180 --> 24:42.140
you and I should have
a weekend in Vegas.

24:42.150 --> 24:43.250
- Absolutely.

24:43.260 --> 24:46.110
- We would clean up.
- Yeah.

24:46.120 --> 24:47.270
- I think we would get
in trouble, though.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.100
- And we'll take Thommy
along as well.

24:49.110 --> 24:49.936
Okay, right.
We're gonna vote.

24:49.936 --> 24:51.000
Okay, right.
We're gonna vote.

24:51.010 --> 24:53.040
I think I know where
this is gonna go. Howie?

24:53.050 --> 24:55.040
- Oh, you know, right?

24:55.050 --> 24:57.070
What am I holding in my mind?

24:57.080 --> 24:59.140
- A big yes.
- Yes. You're correct. Yes.

24:59.150 --> 25:01.000
- Thank you, Howie.
- Mel?

25:01.010 --> 25:02.270
- Yes from me.
- Thank you so much.

25:02.280 --> 25:04.010
- Heidi?

25:04.020 --> 25:05.140
- I'm gonna give you a yes
as well.

25:05.150 --> 25:09.070
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

25:09.080 --> 25:10.210
- Four yeses.
Congratulations.

25:10.220 --> 25:13.000

25:25.230 --> 25:27.170
like you didn't know
that was gonna happen.

25:27.180 --> 25:29.280
- No, we don't know
- She's a witch.

25:29.290 --> 25:31.260
- But look at her.
They're still talking about it.

25:31.270 --> 25:34.060
Like, they're freaked out that
they didn't set it up with them.

25:34.070 --> 25:35.210
Are you freaked out?
It's freaky, right?

25:35.220 --> 25:37.110
- Do you believe in witches?

25:37.120 --> 25:38.150
I do.

25:38.160 --> 25:42.050

can I truly say,

26:02.210 --> 26:04.130
"Now I believe in magic."

26:04.140 --> 26:06.090
- Just that voice
inside that says,

26:06.100 --> 26:08.180
"You don't ever give up."
You know what I'm saying?

26:19.070 --> 26:23.070
- This is the opportunity
of a lifetime.

26:23.080 --> 26:24.160
- We only have one shot.

26:24.170 --> 26:26.240
Put everything we got
into this performance right now.

26:26.250 --> 26:28.150

- This is our chance
to do what we've always dreamed

26:36.030 --> 26:39.020
of doing our whole lives.
- Yes.

26:39.030 --> 26:40.140
- I'm Echo.
- I'm Montre.

26:40.150 --> 26:42.030
- I'm China.
- Big Ron.

26:42.040 --> 26:42.971
- And we are...
- Linkin' Bridge.

26:42.971 --> 26:44.100
- And we are...
- Linkin' Bridge.

26:49.270 --> 26:51.060
- Montre and I are cousins.

26:51.070 --> 26:52.190
We've known each other
all our lives,

26:52.200 --> 26:54.020
and we met
these two knuckleheads

26:54.030 --> 26:55.210
when we was, like, teenagers.

26:55.220 --> 26:58.000
But we are like brothers.

26:58.010 --> 27:00.220
You can't cross one of us.
You're gonna have a problem.

27:00.230 --> 27:03.130
- Yeah.

27:03.140 --> 27:06.180
- We all grew up in
the west end of Louisville...

27:06.190 --> 27:07.260
Pretty rough neighborhood.

27:07.270 --> 27:09.200
- When we got together,
we said we was gonna change

27:09.210 --> 27:10.270
the world, man,

27:10.280 --> 27:12.971
and that's
what we're gonna do, man.

27:12.971 --> 27:13.150
and that's
what we're gonna do, man.

27:13.160 --> 27:15.180
- We pretty much grew up
in the hip-hop era,

27:15.190 --> 27:17.140
listening to, like, Run-D. M. C.

27:17.150 --> 27:20.120
- Tupac.
- NWA.

27:21.160 --> 27:23.040
- I'm ready for a challenge.

27:24.270 --> 27:28.110
- When we get on that stage,
we're gonna rock that crowd.

27:28.120 --> 27:29.250
They won't know what hit them.

27:29.260 --> 27:31.070
- Linkin' Bridge, y'all ready?

27:31.080 --> 27:32.190
- Yes.
- All right.

27:32.200 --> 27:34.110
Well, go get out there
and do what y'all do.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.270
Let's get to it.

27:47.140 --> 27:49.130
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

27:49.140 --> 27:52.090
- So who are you?
- Linkin' Bridge.

27:52.100 --> 27:55.170
- Okay, and could you tell me
your names, please?

27:55.180 --> 27:57.030
- I'm Echo.

27:57.040 --> 27:59.070
- Montre Davis.
- Okay.

27:59.080 --> 28:01.150
- I'm Shine China Lacey.

28:01.160 --> 28:03.100
- Big Ron.

28:03.110 --> 28:05.110
- I can see that.

28:05.120 --> 28:08.140
And how long
has this been together?

28:08.150 --> 28:10.110
- For a little bit of time,

28:10.120 --> 28:12.971
here and there,
you know, breaking off.

28:12.971 --> 28:14.200
here and there,
you know, breaking off.

28:14.210 --> 28:16.050
When we was kids,
we kind of met.

28:16.060 --> 28:17.200
- Yeah.

28:17.210 --> 28:20.060
So why have you entered the
show, "America's Got Talent"?

28:20.070 --> 28:21.190
- I don't know, man.
This dude right here--

28:21.200 --> 28:23.110
he's just a big dreamer,

28:23.120 --> 28:25.080
and because
of his huge dreams,

28:25.090 --> 28:26.230
we got together, man.

28:28.250 --> 28:30.020
- Good luck.

28:30.030 --> 28:32.130

31:18.110 --> 31:21.240
I thought the first half
the song was okay.

31:21.250 --> 31:22.240
- What?

31:24.150 --> 31:25.250
- And then
when you picked it up

31:25.260 --> 31:27.250
in the middle
and you slowed everything down

31:27.260 --> 31:31.140
and we heard your lead...

31:31.150 --> 31:33.130
it was sensational.

31:35.130 --> 31:36.140
- Thank you.

31:36.150 --> 31:38.180

31:58.020 --> 32:01.240
I mean, it's kind
of hard to--

32:01.250 --> 32:03.010
it's kind of hard
to muster that up, man,

32:03.020 --> 32:05.140
when you--hey,
man, just talk.

32:05.150 --> 32:07.040

48:29.250 --> 48:31.000
- Thanks, baby.

48:31.010 --> 48:33.060
- We met at grief counseling--

48:33.070 --> 48:34.190
like,
bereavement counseling.

48:37.030 --> 48:38.250
I've ever seen in my life.

48:38.260 --> 48:40.020
We started kissing.

48:40.030 --> 48:41.956
- No.
- A little bit.

48:41.956 --> 48:42.020
- No.
- A little bit.

48:42.030 --> 48:43.190
- Stop that.
- And then--

48:43.200 --> 48:45.180
- Stop--No, no.
- And then--

48:45.190 --> 48:49.220
- We weren't kissing
in bereavement counseling.

48:49.230 --> 48:52.060
We started talking, and then
what happened, baby?

48:52.070 --> 48:53.120
- Is that when the kissing
started, baby?

48:53.130 --> 48:55.110
- No.
- Oh.

48:55.120 --> 48:56.140
- That's not
when the kissing started.

48:56.150 --> 48:59.150
That's when we got kicked out.

48:59.160 --> 49:03.020
I just feel like this is
where I belong, baby.

49:03.030 --> 49:06.210
- This act all started
in the karaoke bar.

49:06.220 --> 49:09.070
- He started singing
beautifully to me.

49:09.080 --> 49:10.160
Oh, my gosh.

49:10.170 --> 49:11.956
I got up and started
dancing to his singing.

49:11.956 --> 49:15.050
I got up and started
dancing to his singing.

49:15.060 --> 49:17.290
- Both of us together,
the sky's the limit.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.030

give it to them?

49:19.040 --> 49:20.090

counseling, Simon.

49:58.220 --> 50:00.020

50:00.030 --> 50:02.080
- He was, like,
totally checking me out.

50:04.210 --> 50:05.290
- And then what happened?

50:06.000 --> 50:07.290
- Well, we started talking,

50:08.000 --> 50:11.060
and we got kicked out.

50:12.210 --> 50:14.120
- Kicked out for what?

50:14.130 --> 50:18.270
- They said it wasn't
a dating service there.

50:21.190 --> 50:23.040
- Are you married now?

50:23.050 --> 50:25.090
- Yes. We got married.
- Okay. Congratulations.

50:25.100 --> 50:27.030
And, Charlie,
what do you do for a living?

50:27.040 --> 50:29.060
- I work for the United
States Postal Service,

50:29.070 --> 50:32.010
and I deliver mail for you.

50:32.020 --> 50:34.140
- Thank you.
And, Rosie?

50:34.150 --> 50:36.030
- I'm a makeup artist.

50:36.040 --> 50:38.250
- I could tell.
- Thank you.

50:38.260 --> 50:40.270
- Yeah. You're very cute, Rose.
- Thank you so much.

50:40.280 --> 50:41.956

50:41.956 --> 50:42.040
I think

50:42.050 --> 50:43.120

aren't you?

50:52.200 --> 50:54.230
- Thank you, Simon.

50:54.240 --> 50:56.280
Well, look,
we've done enough talking

50:56.290 --> 50:58.120
I'm dying to see

50:58.130 --> 50:59.140
Now good luck.

54:30.240 --> 54:33.250
I would go, see their show.

- One yes.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.210
Mel B?

54:36.220 --> 54:38.050

54:40.200 --> 54:41.956

54:43.210 --> 54:48.140

54:52.220 --> 54:54.130

54:54.140 --> 54:56.090
- I think she thinks she won
the whole show.

54:56.100 --> 54:58.220
- The two

54:58.230 --> 55:00.110
You have to keep doing this.

55:00.120 --> 55:01.260
But for me, it's a no.

55:06.140 --> 55:10.010
- Charles, Rose,
do I think with my head,

55:10.020 --> 55:11.956
or do I think
with my heart here?

55:11.956 --> 55:13.160
or do I think
with my heart here?

55:13.170 --> 55:16.030
Because my head is saying,
"You're nuts,"

55:16.040 --> 55:17.250
and my heart is saying,

55:17.260 --> 55:19.080
"I want to see this
all over again,

55:19.090 --> 55:20.090
but bigger and better."

55:24.290 --> 55:28.100

right now.

1:03:34.190 --> 1:03:36.040
- You and I--
we're a team, Simon.

1:03:36.050 --> 1:03:37.210
- I know
- Weird and weirder.

1:03:37.220 --> 1:03:40.050
- Weirder and weirder.
- Did he call you weird?

1:03:40.060 --> 1:03:41.120
- He said I'm weird.
- I know.

1:03:41.130 --> 1:03:43.230
Weirder than me.
- Yeah.

1:03:43.240 --> 1:03:45.010
- Howie, do you ever get ill?

1:03:45.020 --> 1:03:46.130
- Always.

1:03:46.140 --> 1:03:48.210
I have no antibodies,
because I stay away.

1:03:48.220 --> 1:03:50.220
It's good to have germs,

1:03:50.230 --> 1:03:52.080
but I'm always--I have
a cold right now.

1:04:00.060 --> 1:04:01.250
- Hello.
- Hello.

1:04:01.260 --> 1:04:03.220
- Hello.
- And welcome. And who are you?

1:04:03.230 --> 1:04:04.280
- I'm Ryan Stock.

1:04:04.290 --> 1:04:06.050
- And I'm AmberLynn.
- Okay.

1:04:06.060 --> 1:04:07.140
And how do you know each other?

1:04:07.150 --> 1:04:09.000
- We're a couple.

1:04:09.010 --> 1:04:10.160
- Okay.
- Aw.

1:04:10.170 --> 1:04:11.220
- And where did you meet?

1:04:11.230 --> 1:04:14.240
- We met 15 years ago
at a festival.

1:04:14.250 --> 1:04:16.130
I was working as an entertainer,

1:04:16.140 --> 1:04:18.230
and I found her dressed
as a fairy,

1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:19.280
crying in an alley,

1:04:19.290 --> 1:04:22.120
actually--just sitting
on a bench, crying.

1:04:22.130 --> 1:04:23.240
- And then what happened?

1:04:23.250 --> 1:04:25.240
- And then
I hired her as my assistant,

1:04:25.250 --> 1:04:27.260
and we've been together
24 hours a day,

1:04:27.270 --> 1:04:29.250
7 days a week
for the last 15 years.

1:04:29.260 --> 1:04:29.939
- That's incredible.
- Wow.

1:04:29.939 --> 1:04:31.280
- That's incredible.
- Wow.

1:04:37.070 --> 1:04:38.200
- Wow.

1:04:38.210 --> 1:04:40.120
And the act you're gonna show us
tonight--this is something

1:04:40.130 --> 1:04:41.240
you've been working on
for this show.

1:04:41.250 --> 1:04:43.000
- It's something special,

1:04:43.010 --> 1:04:44.240
something that has never been
done before, actually,

1:04:44.250 --> 1:04:46.030
we're gonna attempt tonight.

1:04:46.040 --> 1:04:48.100
- Okay. Well, listen.
This is whole point of the show.

1:04:48.110 --> 1:04:49.180
Best of luck.
- Thank you.

1:04:49.190 --> 1:04:51.030
- Thank you.
- All right.

1:04:51.040 --> 1:04:52.150
We're gonna start this out
really simple.

1:04:52.160 --> 1:04:54.180
Before we do the big stunt,
I want you guys to have an idea

1:04:54.190 --> 1:04:56.090
of the kind of stuff
we're gonna be doing.

1:04:56.100 --> 1:04:58.040
So Amber Lynn is gonna
go out into the crowd here.

1:04:58.050 --> 1:04:59.080
She's gonna be careful.

1:04:59.090 --> 1:04:59.939
She's got a pair
of scissors in her hand.

1:04:59.939 --> 1:05:00.210
She's got a pair
of scissors in her hand.

1:05:00.220 --> 1:05:02.100
She doesn't want
to run with them.

1:05:02.110 --> 1:05:04.110
She's bringing them
over to Howie, actually.

1:05:04.120 --> 1:05:06.060
Howie, if you could do me
a favor and take a look

1:05:06.070 --> 1:05:07.090
at those scissors.

1:05:07.100 --> 1:05:09.060
Make sure
they open and close.

1:05:09.070 --> 1:05:10.230
Make sure they're
a regular pair of scissors.

1:05:10.240 --> 1:05:11.240
Bang them on the table
and make sure

1:05:11.250 --> 1:05:13.060
they're made of metal.

1:05:13.070 --> 1:05:14.210
Feel the metal part.
Make sure it's real.

1:05:14.220 --> 1:05:16.240
- It's real.
- Hand them back to AmberLynn.

1:05:16.250 --> 1:05:18.120
AmberLynn
is gonna bring them back.

1:05:18.130 --> 1:05:21.120
That's just--we wanted you
to ensure that this is real.

1:05:21.130 --> 1:05:23.180
- You want the bald guy
to ensure the scissors are real.

1:05:23.190 --> 1:05:25.150
- Real scissors?
- Absolutely.

1:05:25.160 --> 1:05:26.170
- Real scissors.
Perfect.

1:05:26.180 --> 1:05:27.290
Now, this is
a little bit strange.

1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:29.220
It's a little bit gross.
- Oh.

1:05:29.230 --> 1:05:29.939
- We're gonna start this out.
Real scissors, real nose.

1:05:29.939 --> 1:05:34.160
- We're gonna start this out.
Real scissors, real nose.

1:05:34.170 --> 1:05:36.020
Okay. I didn't--
Calm down.

1:05:36.030 --> 1:05:38.090
I didn't do it yet.
I didn't do it.

1:05:38.100 --> 1:05:40.070
Real scissors, real nose.

1:05:40.080 --> 1:05:42.000
Check it out.

1:05:42.010 --> 1:05:43.130
- Oh!

1:05:43.140 --> 1:05:44.290
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:46.220
That's not the gross part.
That's not the gross part.

1:05:46.230 --> 1:05:48.280
Howie did just have them
in his hand.

1:05:48.290 --> 1:05:51.010
Not the first time
they've been in my nose, Howie.

1:05:51.020 --> 1:05:54.160
Sorry, sorry.

1:05:54.170 --> 1:05:57.120
That's not
the gross part either.

1:05:57.130 --> 1:05:58.240
That's not
the gross part either.

1:05:58.250 --> 1:05:59.939
Watch.

1:05:59.939 --> 1:06:02.210
Watch.

1:06:02.220 --> 1:06:04.110
- Lord, help him.

1:06:04.120 --> 1:06:07.030
- That's how you get
the nose hairs at the very back.

1:06:07.040 --> 1:06:09.260
- Oh, my God.
- Check it out.

1:06:09.270 --> 1:06:12.020
- Oh.
- Baby Jesus!

1:06:12.030 --> 1:06:13.070
- Here we go.

1:06:13.080 --> 1:06:14.130
That's not
the gross part either.

1:06:14.140 --> 1:06:16.010
Watch.

1:06:20.250 --> 1:06:23.080
Okay, that's the gross part.
Look...

1:06:23.090 --> 1:06:25.180
if licking snot
off of scissors is wrong,

1:06:25.190 --> 1:06:27.030
I don't want to be right.

1:06:27.040 --> 1:06:29.090
That's all I'm saying.
- Don't try that at home.

1:06:29.100 --> 1:06:29.939
- Now, that's just one way
to clear out the sinuses.

1:06:29.939 --> 1:06:31.200
- Now, that's just one way
to clear out the sinuses.

1:06:31.210 --> 1:06:33.130
We're gonna show you guys
something kind of weird.

1:06:33.140 --> 1:06:35.070
- I cannot watch this.
- No!

1:06:35.080 --> 1:06:36.220
- Something kind
of intense with this meat hook

1:06:36.230 --> 1:06:38.180
I can tell by the look
on some of your faces,

1:06:38.190 --> 1:06:42.000
you're already thinking,
"Where is he gonna stick that?"

1:06:42.010 --> 1:06:44.010
Ladies and gentlemen, we call it
the human meathead.

1:06:44.020 --> 1:06:45.100
Howie, did you want to take
a look at that,

1:06:45.110 --> 1:06:46.130
make sure it's real?

1:06:46.140 --> 1:06:47.230
- No. I don't want
to see anything.

1:06:47.240 --> 1:06:50.000
- You learn from your mistakes.
That's good to see.

1:06:50.010 --> 1:06:51.240
Ladies and gentlemen,
this meat hook

1:06:51.250 --> 1:06:53.060
is 15 inches long.

1:06:53.070 --> 1:06:54.280
It's 3/8 of an inch thick.

1:06:54.290 --> 1:06:57.170
It's solid steel,
sharpened on one end

1:06:57.180 --> 1:06:59.270
with a handle on the other side.

1:06:59.280 --> 1:06:59.939
This is gonna get
a little bit weird,

1:06:59.939 --> 1:07:01.090
This is gonna get
a little bit weird,

1:07:01.100 --> 1:07:02.230
a little bit sick.

1:07:02.240 --> 1:07:04.140
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's take it up a notch.

to the wrong person first,

1:08:57.020 --> 1:08:59.939
because I love
this kind of act,

1:08:59.939 --> 1:09:00.030
because I love
this kind of act,

1:09:00.040 --> 1:09:01.180
but I just can't watch it.

1:09:01.190 --> 1:09:02.250
- Well,
that's kind of the idea.

1:09:02.260 --> 1:09:04.240
- So if you just
want to explain to me

1:09:04.250 --> 1:09:06.000
what the grand finale was

1:09:06.010 --> 1:09:07.160
without showing me--
just explain.

1:09:07.170 --> 1:09:09.000
- I'm just hanging
myself from--

1:09:09.010 --> 1:09:10.060
- He hung himself up
by his nose.

1:09:10.070 --> 1:09:11.090
- Yeah.
By his nose.

1:09:11.100 --> 1:09:13.030
The hook went in his nose,
out his throat,

1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:14.240
and he hung himself like that.
- Oh, my God.

1:09:14.250 --> 1:09:15.240
- In mid-air.

1:09:15.250 --> 1:09:17.030
- He started--
- See?

1:09:17.040 --> 1:09:18.140
- He put scissors in his nose.
- All right. All right.

1:09:18.150 --> 1:09:20.000
I saw that bit.
- And he licked them.

1:09:20.010 --> 1:09:23.020
- So I think you're very
talented to be able to do that,

1:09:23.030 --> 1:09:24.100
but--

1:09:24.110 --> 1:09:25.260
I can't watch it.

1:09:25.270 --> 1:09:27.270
- I just want to know.
Like, you're in an alley,

1:09:27.280 --> 1:09:29.939
and you find a strange,
crying fairy.

1:09:29.939 --> 1:09:30.000
and you find a strange,
crying fairy.

1:09:30.010 --> 1:09:31.120
- Right.

1:09:31.130 --> 1:09:33.100
- What do you say?
"Don't cry.

1:09:33.110 --> 1:09:37.060
You can come with me and help
me hang things from my nose."

1:09:37.070 --> 1:09:38.060
- Yes, yes.

1:09:38.070 --> 1:09:39.190
- Kind of. Yeah.
- Pretty much.

1:09:39.200 --> 1:09:41.070
- That's pretty much
how it went down. Yeah.

1:09:41.080 --> 1:09:43.040
- What was happening
in your life, ma'am,

1:09:43.050 --> 1:09:44.210
that this is
a better life for you?

1:09:49.260 --> 1:09:51.090
- I think
the two of you are really,

1:09:51.100 --> 1:09:52.180
really sweet people,

1:09:52.190 --> 1:09:54.250
but I just--I can't handle
this kind of stuff.

1:09:54.260 --> 1:09:56.070
I can't watch.

1:09:56.080 --> 1:09:58.090
- No. I get that.
I can tell you this, right?

1:09:58.100 --> 1:09:59.170
I couldn't watch most of it,

1:09:59.180 --> 1:09:59.939
but in all my years
of doing this,

1:09:59.939 --> 1:10:01.240
but in all my years
of doing this,

1:10:01.250 --> 1:10:04.030
it was probably
the most disgusting thing

1:10:04.040 --> 1:10:06.010
I've ever seen.

1:10:06.020 --> 1:10:08.150
But...

1:10:08.160 --> 1:10:09.180
I loved it.

1:10:09.190 --> 1:10:11.040
- Well, thank you.
- Thank you.

1:10:11.050 --> 1:10:13.070
- And I want to see
where this will go.

1:10:16.140 --> 1:10:18.030
So we're gonna vote now.

1:10:18.040 --> 1:10:19.100
Let me start with Howie.

1:10:19.110 --> 1:10:22.070
- I feel weird, but I...

1:10:22.080 --> 1:10:23.080
I loved it.

1:10:23.090 --> 1:10:24.190
I loved it.
So it's a yes from me.

1:10:24.200 --> 1:10:25.280
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1:10:28.280 --> 1:10:29.939
- Mel?
- I need help to vote,

1:10:29.939 --> 1:10:31.000
- Mel?
- I need help to vote,

1:10:31.010 --> 1:10:32.180
because I only watched
a little bit of it.

1:10:32.190 --> 1:10:34.160
- We got a lot more.
- I can only imagine.

1:10:34.170 --> 1:10:35.290
So what do you say?

1:10:38.270 --> 1:10:40.200
Okay. Well, I'm gonna
go with the audience

1:10:40.210 --> 1:10:42.280
and say yes.
- Thank you.

1:10:42.290 --> 1:10:43.280
- Thank you.

1:10:43.290 --> 1:10:45.280
- Heidi?

1:10:45.290 --> 1:10:47.090
- I did not like it.

1:10:47.100 --> 1:10:49.230
I'm really, really sorry.
I'm gonna give you a no.

1:10:49.240 --> 1:10:52.060
- That's okay.

1:10:54.150 --> 1:10:57.070
- I'm gonna apologize
to America in advance,

1:10:57.080 --> 1:10:58.200
because you've got three yeses.

1:10:58.210 --> 1:10:59.939
- Yeah, thank you.

1:10:59.939 --> 1:11:00.140
- Yeah, thank you.

1:11:00.150 --> 1:11:03.010

of this show, Simon Cowell,

1:12:03.100 --> 1:12:06.030
has discovered many singers.

1:12:06.040 --> 1:12:08.210
So are you nervous
about singing in front of him?

1:12:08.220 --> 1:12:10.230
- I am kind of nervous.

1:12:10.240 --> 1:12:12.190
If he doesn't like you,

1:12:12.200 --> 1:12:15.270
he will tell you the truth.

1:12:39.260 --> 1:12:40.260
- Tyler.

1:12:40.270 --> 1:12:41.260
- Yeah.
You shouldn't be singing.

1:12:41.270 --> 1:12:43.060
- No. That's harsh. No.
- Okay.

1:12:43.070 --> 1:12:44.190
Well, you shouldn't be
singing loudly.

1:12:44.200 --> 1:12:46.280
- They were just very nervous.
- I don't care.

1:12:46.290 --> 1:12:48.100
- Very, very, very nervous.
- I'm being honest with them.

1:12:48.110 --> 1:12:50.290
I don't want to say this
was anywhere near good enough,

1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.110
and you've got to come back
much better than that.

1:12:53.120 --> 1:12:54.947
- I'm excited, but so nervous.
- That's okay.

1:12:54.947 --> 1:12:55.220
- I'm excited, but so nervous.
- That's okay.

1:12:55.230 --> 1:12:57.000
You know what?
It's the same thing.

1:12:57.010 --> 1:12:58.290
Nervous and excitement
is exactly the same thing.

- Noelle, for me,
that's probably exactly

1:13:14.080 --> 1:13:16.000
the same music
you would do at any gig

1:13:16.010 --> 1:13:17.100
that you've just done,
you know?

1:13:17.110 --> 1:13:18.240
It was quick.
It was nice.

1:13:18.250 --> 1:13:22.030
But I'm not gonna be saying
in 30 minutes' time,

1:13:22.040 --> 1:13:23.250
"I heard something
or saw something

1:13:23.260 --> 1:13:24.947
I've never heard before."

1:13:24.947 --> 1:13:25.020
I've never heard before."

1:13:26.280 --> 1:13:29.220
- It's a huge accomplishment,
so be proud.

1:13:29.230 --> 1:13:31.010
- Yeah.
- Okay, Laura.

1:13:31.020 --> 1:13:32.080
- Good luck.
- Here we go, baby.

1:13:32.090 --> 1:13:34.070
- Thank you.

1:13:36.040 --> 1:13:39.020
- Hello.

1:13:39.030 --> 1:13:41.110
Hi, young lady.
- Hi.

1:13:41.120 --> 1:13:43.030
- What's your name?
- Laura.

1:13:43.040 --> 1:13:44.190
- Laura.
How old are you, Laura?

1:13:44.200 --> 1:13:46.070
- I'm 13.
- 13.

1:13:46.080 --> 1:13:48.110
Are you a singer?

1:13:48.120 --> 1:13:49.180
- Yes.
- Yes.

1:13:49.190 --> 1:13:51.100
And have you been
doing this for a long time?

1:13:51.110 --> 1:13:53.070
- Well, my mom
always liked to sing,

1:13:53.080 --> 1:13:54.947
and, you know,
she saw that I liked it too.

1:13:54.947 --> 1:13:56.060
and, you know,
she saw that I liked it too.

1:13:56.070 --> 1:13:59.060
So she helped me practice
and pick out the songs,

1:13:59.070 --> 1:14:00.170
and here I am.

1:14:00.180 --> 1:14:02.060
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1:14:02.070 --> 1:14:04.070
- Are you nervous?
- I'm nervous.

1:14:04.080 --> 1:14:05.290
- Are you nervous?
- I don't know.

1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:08.080
I just see
so many talented people,

1:14:08.090 --> 1:14:09.150
and, you know, it just--

1:14:12.010 --> 1:14:14.050
- She's gonna do great.

1:14:14.060 --> 1:14:16.110
- All you got to do is sing
the song that you picked out.

1:14:16.120 --> 1:14:17.110
Okay?
- Thank you.

1:14:17.120 --> 1:14:19.110
- All right.

1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:51.110
- She's 13.

1:15:12.030 --> 1:15:14.020
- Whoa!

1:16:03.210 --> 1:16:06.070
- God.

1:16:08.270 --> 1:16:09.260
- Wow!

1:16:09.270 --> 1:16:12.070
Where'd that voice come from?

1:16:15.090 --> 1:16:16.290
- They won't stop clapping.

1:16:30.030 --> 1:16:32.170
- Wow.

1:16:32.180 --> 1:16:34.260
- Wow.

1:16:34.270 --> 1:16:37.010
You were nervous?

1:16:38.260 --> 1:16:40.240
How do you feel now?

1:16:40.250 --> 1:16:42.250
- Relieved.

1:16:46.040 --> 1:16:47.090
- Heidi?

1:16:47.100 --> 1:16:50.230
- You are born
with such a gift.

1:16:50.240 --> 1:16:52.080
It is unbelievable.

1:16:52.090 --> 1:16:53.270
I could not stop smiling.

1:16:53.280 --> 1:16:54.947
Like, you put me
in the best mood.

1:16:54.947 --> 1:16:55.250
Like, you put me
in the best mood.

1:16:55.260 --> 1:16:58.080
Wow.
Loved it.

1:16:58.090 --> 1:17:00.050
- Thank you.

1:17:00.060 --> 1:17:01.210
- Simon?

1:17:01.220 --> 1:17:04.230
- That didn't just happen.

1:17:04.240 --> 1:17:08.200
Honest to God, you came out
like a jelly.

1:17:08.210 --> 1:17:11.290
I didn't think you were gonna
be able to talk.

1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:13.270
And then I'm thinking
to myself, "Oh, my God,

1:17:13.280 --> 1:17:16.230
if she starts to sing,
this is not gonna work."

1:17:16.240 --> 1:17:18.280
And then that just happened.

1:17:18.290 --> 1:17:22.290
I have never heard anything
like that in all the years

1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:24.250
I've been doing this show.

1:17:24.260 --> 1:17:24.947
Seriously.

1:17:24.947 --> 1:17:26.270
Seriously.

1:17:26.280 --> 1:17:30.090
It was unbelievable.

1:17:30.100 --> 1:17:32.100
- Wow, wow, wow.

1:17:32.110 --> 1:17:34.100
To hear Simon say that...

1:17:34.110 --> 1:17:36.100
- And what made it
even better is the fact

1:17:36.110 --> 1:17:39.000
that you are
such a sweet person,

1:17:39.010 --> 1:17:43.170
so humble, not even aware
of how amazing you are.

1:17:43.180 --> 1:17:45.150
Thank you so much
for coming on this show.

1:17:45.160 --> 1:17:47.080
That was really, really,
really special.

1:17:47.090 --> 1:17:50.000
Amazing.

1:17:50.010 --> 1:17:51.090

1:17:51.100 --> 1:17:54.947
- You literally made
all my hairs stand up on end,

1:17:54.947 --> 1:17:55.230
- You literally made
all my hairs stand up on end,

1:17:55.240 --> 1:17:57.180

1:17:57.190 --> 1:17:59.020

1:20:20.170 --> 1:20:22.120
- Good acts today.
- Yeah.

1:20:22.120 --> 1:20:23.290
- Huh, guys?
- It's fantastic.

1:20:24.000 --> 1:20:25.160
- Yeah.
- Una más.

1:20:25.170 --> 1:20:28.050
- Sí.

1:20:28.060 --> 1:20:30.170
- Did you already perform,
or you have to still go up?

1:20:30.180 --> 1:20:32.030
- I'm the last act.

1:20:32.040 --> 1:20:33.160
My name is Greg.

1:20:33.170 --> 1:20:35.120
I'm 61 years old.

1:20:35.130 --> 1:20:37.020
I'm from Daytona Beach, Florida,

1:20:37.030 --> 1:20:38.220
and I have a passion for danger.

1:20:41.020 --> 1:20:42.230
In my family,
we were always raised

1:20:42.240 --> 1:20:44.120
to work hard,
get a career,

1:20:44.130 --> 1:20:46.090
follow that line through life.

1:20:46.100 --> 1:20:47.946
But, you know, deep inside,

1:20:47.946 --> 1:20:48.000
But, you know, deep inside,

1:20:48.010 --> 1:20:52.030
I always had a passion
for danger and risk.

1:20:52.040 --> 1:20:54.240
My act requires
a lifetime of preparation,

1:20:54.250 --> 1:20:58.060
not only physically,
but mentally.

1:20:58.070 --> 1:21:00.120
The judges are always asking
for bigger,

1:21:00.130 --> 1:21:02.070
more explosive,

1:21:02.080 --> 1:21:03.120
more dangerous,

1:21:03.130 --> 1:21:05.230
and I'm here
to give them that.

1:21:05.240 --> 1:21:07.050
If I don't get this just right,

1:21:07.060 --> 1:21:10.120
I could be going home
in an ambulance.

1:21:10.130 --> 1:21:12.010
- Go for it.
- All right. All right.

1:21:12.020 --> 1:21:15.180
Children, do not
try this at home.

1:21:15.190 --> 1:21:17.946
- Hello.
Good evening, sir.

1:21:17.946 --> 1:21:18.060
- Hello.
Good evening, sir.

1:21:18.070 --> 1:21:20.020
Hi. What's your name?

1:21:20.030 --> 1:21:21.120
- My name is Greg.

1:21:21.130 --> 1:21:24.140
- And what do you do, Greg,
for a living?

1:21:24.150 --> 1:21:25.220
- Well, I'm retired now,

1:21:25.230 --> 1:21:28.070
but before, I worked
in construction for a long time.

1:21:28.080 --> 1:21:30.240
But I've always had a passion
for the big stage here.

1:21:30.250 --> 1:21:32.110
- So what you're
gonna do tonight

1:21:32.120 --> 1:21:33.230
is a passion project.
- It is.

1:21:33.240 --> 1:21:36.120
- How long have you been doing
what it is you do?

1:21:36.130 --> 1:21:39.220
- You know, it's been
a lifetime in preparation,

1:21:39.230 --> 1:21:42.000
a few moments of inspiration,

1:21:42.010 --> 1:21:44.170
and tonight will be
the culmination.

1:21:44.180 --> 1:21:45.220
- Is this something
that you think

1:21:45.230 --> 1:21:47.140
could win
the whole competition?

1:21:47.150 --> 1:21:47.946
- I believe it can.

1:21:47.946 --> 1:21:49.010
- I believe it can.

1:21:49.020 --> 1:21:51.180
Yes.

1:21:51.190 --> 1:21:53.180
- I think this is gonna
be dangerous.

1:21:53.190 --> 1:21:54.220
- Okay.

1:21:54.230 --> 1:21:56.090
Let's see what you do.

1:21:56.100 --> 1:21:58.250
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

1:21:58.260 --> 1:22:01.000
- He looks nervous.
- He does.

1:22:01.010 --> 1:22:02.060
- Yeah.

1:22:02.070 --> 1:22:05.000
- Is it gonna be dangerous
for us right here?

1:22:05.010 --> 1:22:06.140
- Oh, no.

1:22:14.030 --> 1:22:15.040
What's in there?

1:22:18.090 --> 1:22:22.030
- I'm kind of scared.
I wonder what he's gonna do.

1:22:57.260 --> 1:22:59.240
- Is that it?

1:23:04.090 --> 1:23:05.200
- Possibly the worst thing

1:23:05.210 --> 1:23:08.040
we've seen so far
on "America's Got Talent."

1:23:08.050 --> 1:23:09.250
You know what?
I'm going home.

1:23:09.260 --> 1:23:11.120
Yeah.

1:23:11.130 --> 1:23:15.200
I've had it.
Good night, everyone.

1:23:15.210 --> 1:23:17.946
- He's actually leaving.
Do you want to vote, Heidi?

1:23:17.946 --> 1:23:18.020
- He's actually leaving.
Do you want to vote, Heidi?

1:23:18.030 --> 1:23:20.150
- No.
- Mel, do you want to vote?

1:23:20.160 --> 1:23:22.240
- No. I'm really annoyed.
- No, no.

1:23:22.250 --> 1:23:24.090
- You jump in it, Nick.

1:23:24.100 --> 1:23:28.010
- Jump, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick--
- No!

1:23:28.020 --> 1:23:32.110
- Jump, jump, jump, jump--
- Push him in.

1:23:35.110 --> 1:23:37.040
No, she's not.

1:23:54.200 --> 1:23:56.010
- Howie!
- Howie.

1:23:56.020 --> 1:23:58.000
- Come on!
- No.

1:24:03.150 --> 1:24:04.240
No.
- Oh!

1:24:16.050 --> 1:24:17.946
Stop it!

1:24:17.946 --> 1:24:19.040
Stop it!

1:24:27.080 --> 1:24:29.020
No!

1:24:29.030 --> 1:24:31.090
- Oh, my--really?

1:24:31.100 --> 1:24:33.260
- One of those days.
- I'm going in.

1:24:33.270 --> 1:24:36.020
Did I get any on me?
Oh, I got some on me.

1:24:36.030 --> 1:24:38.000
- Good night, everybody!

1:24:41.110 --> 1:24:42.180
- Hey.

1:24:44.180 --> 1:24:47.946
- In my mouth--in my mouth--
you got it in my mouth.

1:24:47.946 --> 1:24:48.140
- In my mouth--in my mouth--
you got it in my mouth.

1:24:48.150 --> 1:24:50.090
- It was a good night.

1:24:50.100 --> 1:24:52.030
That's how we do it, baby.

1:24:52.040 --> 1:24:55.140
"AGT."

1:24:55.150 --> 1:24:58.140
- This is not why I came back
to America.
