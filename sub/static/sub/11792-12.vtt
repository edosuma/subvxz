00:18.117 --> 00:19.874
I woke up I didn't know

00:19.942 --> 00:21.120
where I was.

00:21.188 --> 00:24.332
Didn't know who I was.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.520
Couldn't believe I'd slept

00:26.588 --> 00:29.173
through most of my life.

00:29.241 --> 00:31.694
I'd been unconscious for 22

00:31.762 --> 00:36.324
years. Since 1989. I was 18.

00:36.398 --> 00:38.305
And the accident happened

00:38.373 --> 00:39.718
at a construction site,

00:39.786 --> 00:40.924
is that right?

00:40.992 --> 00:42.436
Yes, it was a summer job.

00:42.504 --> 00:43.609
I was installing a church

00:43.677 --> 00:46.726
steeple. A crane collapsed.

00:46.794 --> 00:47.965
I don't even remember it hitting

00:48.033 --> 00:49.809
me. One second, it was

00:49.877 --> 00:51.381
a beautiful day, the next,

00:51.449 --> 00:53.356
phhtt... lights out.

00:53.424 --> 00:55.399
And what exactly is it that

00:55.466 --> 00:56.741
brought you here? What don't you

00:56.809 --> 00:58.916
like about yourself?

00:58.984 --> 01:00.524
Jesus, man, look at me.

01:00.591 --> 01:02.096
I'm ancient!

01:02.164 --> 01:05.410
Even though my body was alive

01:05.477 --> 01:07.586
for 40 years, I was only awake

01:07.654 --> 01:08.824
for 18.

01:08.892 --> 01:10.732
And you want to look like

01:10.800 --> 01:12.303
an 18 year old again?

01:12.371 --> 01:14.411
I am an 18 year old!

01:14.479 --> 01:17.658
I had plans before I went in

01:17.726 --> 01:18.696
the coma. I was gonna go to

01:18.763 --> 01:20.100
college. I was gonna meet

01:20.167 --> 01:22.007
a girl, have a family.

01:22.075 --> 01:24.548
Have a career.

01:24.618 --> 01:25.552
Mr. Kenny...

01:25.622 --> 01:26.658
See, that's...

01:26.725 --> 01:29.902
I'm a mister. I'm a mister now.

01:32.009 --> 01:35.085
I look in the mirror and I see

01:35.152 --> 01:37.258
this old man looking back at me.

01:37.325 --> 01:40.334
And I'm like, "who are you?

01:40.402 --> 01:44.480
Who put me in your body?"

01:44.547 --> 01:46.788
I need you to make the outside

01:46.856 --> 01:50.430
match the inside. You can give

01:50.497 --> 01:52.368
me a chance to live all those

01:52.436 --> 01:53.673
years that I lost for the first

01:53.741 --> 01:56.146
time, fully awake.

01:56.214 --> 01:59.287
You can give me back my life.

03:30.798 --> 03:33.366
Why aren't you getting ready?

03:33.434 --> 03:34.701
Ready? For what?

03:34.768 --> 03:35.701
I have a meet and greet

03:35.769 --> 03:36.935
at the pacific design center

03:37.003 --> 03:38.337
tonight. I told you this

03:38.404 --> 03:41.072
a week ago, you don't remember?

03:42.574 --> 03:43.974
Christian, this is really

03:44.042 --> 03:44.808
important. I need to make

03:44.875 --> 03:46.176
contacts tonight, and I had all

03:46.243 --> 03:50.546
of these business cards made.

03:50.614 --> 03:53.249
"Over 15 years experience."

03:53.317 --> 03:54.750
In what?

03:54.817 --> 03:56.117
Well, I had a life before

03:56.185 --> 03:57.485
you and I met.

03:57.553 --> 03:58.586
I designed all my own

03:58.654 --> 04:00.020
movie sets.

04:00.088 --> 04:01.321
Oh. Ok.

04:01.389 --> 04:03.556
Well, you haven't exactly

04:03.624 --> 04:04.590
thanked me for what I've done

04:04.658 --> 04:05.925
here.

04:05.992 --> 04:06.792
Can't imagine how that

04:06.860 --> 04:08.126
slipped my mind.

04:08.194 --> 04:10.895
Look, I know it takes

04:10.963 --> 04:12.229
a little bit of getting used to,

04:12.297 --> 04:13.864
but in the overcrowded markets

04:13.931 --> 04:15.232
in L.A., you need to make

04:15.299 --> 04:17.502
bold style choices.

04:17.570 --> 04:19.774
And speaking of style, could you

04:19.841 --> 04:20.875
please get up off the couch

04:20.942 --> 04:22.949
and go get dressed?

04:24.789 --> 04:25.655
This is the third time

04:25.723 --> 04:26.689
you tried to drag me out this

04:26.757 --> 04:27.523
week, all right? I didn't get

04:27.591 --> 04:28.857
married so that you could get me

04:28.925 --> 04:30.292
in a suit and have me rub elbows

04:30.359 --> 04:34.628
with the great unwashed.

04:36.796 --> 04:39.030
All right.

04:39.098 --> 04:41.265
Look, I got the house, the job,

04:41.333 --> 04:43.533
the beautiful wife. Just let me

04:43.600 --> 04:45.267
relax and enjoy my life.

04:48.337 --> 04:50.638
Ok.

04:55.643 --> 04:56.980
Awesome ballgame last night.

04:57.048 --> 04:59.083
You get to catch it?

04:59.151 --> 05:00.284
Is that you?

05:00.352 --> 05:01.051
Huh?

05:01.119 --> 05:02.419
You stink.

05:02.487 --> 05:04.088
And you look like shit.

05:04.156 --> 05:05.289
Thank you.

05:05.357 --> 05:06.090
You know how long it took me to

05:06.158 --> 05:07.558
get ready this morning?

05:07.625 --> 05:09.392
3 minutes. Got to catch

05:09.460 --> 05:10.360
Sportscenter for the first time

05:10.428 --> 05:12.230
in months, didn't cut myself

05:12.297 --> 05:13.967
shaving, didn't have to swing by

05:14.035 --> 05:15.001
the dry cleaners on my way

05:15.069 --> 05:16.169
to the office.

05:16.237 --> 05:17.671
Yeah, maybe you should have.

05:17.739 --> 05:19.307
I am done getting up at 6:00

05:19.375 --> 05:20.142
every day, getting ready for

05:20.210 --> 05:21.378
work. Shower, shave, do the

05:21.446 --> 05:23.447
hair, press the suit.

05:23.515 --> 05:24.549
All that bullshit's hard on

05:24.616 --> 05:25.784
a man. Why are you looking

05:25.851 --> 05:27.351
at that thing, by the way?

05:27.419 --> 05:29.320
Trying to find a bed.

05:29.388 --> 05:30.221
Only have a mattress on

05:30.289 --> 05:31.089
the floor right now.

05:31.157 --> 05:32.190
A man over thirty should

05:32.258 --> 05:33.391
never buy anything that he has

05:33.459 --> 05:34.357
to put together, particularly

05:34.425 --> 05:35.756
from the swedes.

05:35.823 --> 05:36.989
Mm-hmm.

05:37.057 --> 05:39.688
Julia used to buy our furniture.

05:39.754 --> 05:41.288
Never really had to do this

05:41.356 --> 05:43.256
before. Never had my own place

05:43.324 --> 05:44.323
until now.

05:44.391 --> 05:45.926
Ha, call my wife.

05:45.994 --> 05:47.294
She apparently is an interior

05:47.362 --> 05:48.662
designer now.

05:48.730 --> 05:49.764
Kimber?

05:49.832 --> 05:53.767
Matter of fact...

05:53.835 --> 05:55.969
You'd be doing me a huge favor.

05:56.037 --> 05:57.270
She's being a real pain in

05:57.338 --> 05:59.739
the ass.

05:59.807 --> 06:01.909
Do you mind giving her a buzz?

06:01.977 --> 06:04.813
Huh?

06:13.155 --> 06:14.555
Excuse me. I've been

06:14.623 --> 06:16.190
waiting for a half hour.

06:16.257 --> 06:17.790
Should I reschedule?

06:17.858 --> 06:19.057
I told you already, we'll be

06:19.125 --> 06:20.825
with you as soon as we can.

06:20.892 --> 06:22.526
Hi.

06:22.594 --> 06:23.830
Hi.

06:23.898 --> 06:25.232
Sorry to keep you waiting,

06:25.299 --> 06:26.366
Mrs., um...

06:26.433 --> 06:27.200
Banks.

06:27.267 --> 06:27.867
Banks.

06:27.935 --> 06:28.568
Willow Banks.

06:28.635 --> 06:29.902
Willow Banks. Wow.

06:29.970 --> 06:31.637
Beautiful. Dr. Christian Troy.

06:32.639 --> 06:33.939
You a model?

06:34.006 --> 06:35.106
I was.

06:35.174 --> 06:35.974
Great.

06:36.042 --> 06:37.342
I'd like to apologize

06:37.409 --> 06:38.376
for the receptionist. She can

06:38.443 --> 06:39.443
be a real bitch sometimes.

06:39.511 --> 06:40.477
Dr. Troy...

06:40.545 --> 06:41.578
do it again, you're fired.

06:41.646 --> 06:44.547
Ok?

06:44.615 --> 06:46.182
Shall we?

06:46.250 --> 06:48.117
Yeah.

06:48.184 --> 06:49.518
Please don't fire her on my

06:49.586 --> 06:51.286
account. Women always seem

06:51.354 --> 06:52.854
to treat me like that.

06:52.922 --> 06:53.955
Maybe I'll give her a raise.

06:55.691 --> 06:57.692
Ahh.

07:02.231 --> 07:03.598
Maybe I should bang

07:03.666 --> 07:05.700
the shit out of you right here

07:05.768 --> 07:09.671
on this desk.

07:09.739 --> 07:13.675
Dr. Troy?

07:13.743 --> 07:16.144
Dr. Troy? Excuse me?

07:16.212 --> 07:18.646
Yes. So...

07:18.714 --> 07:21.115
What can I do for you,

07:21.183 --> 07:24.185
Ms. Banks? I'd ask you what you

07:24.252 --> 07:25.152
don't like about yourself,

07:25.220 --> 07:26.420
but you look pretty good to me.

07:27.655 --> 07:28.822
Well, that's exactly

07:28.890 --> 07:29.957
the problem.

07:30.024 --> 07:30.924
Right.

07:30.992 --> 07:31.792
I'm tired of all

07:31.859 --> 07:32.492
the attention I get because

07:32.560 --> 07:34.294
of the way I look. I'm tired

07:34.362 --> 07:35.996
of every guy I meet either being

07:36.063 --> 07:37.230
too intimidated to talk to me,

07:37.298 --> 07:38.965
or think that he can just stroll

07:39.033 --> 07:40.166
up and ask me out.

07:40.234 --> 07:41.334
Hmm.

07:41.402 --> 07:42.101
I can't tell you how many

07:42.169 --> 07:43.002
times a guy has tried some

07:43.069 --> 07:43.969
cheesy pick-up line or howled

07:44.037 --> 07:46.271
like a dog as I walk by. I mean,

07:46.339 --> 07:48.173
is it too much to ask for just

07:48.241 --> 07:49.308
a little conversation before

07:49.375 --> 07:50.308
telling me that you're

07:50.376 --> 07:51.843
envisioning me naked?

07:52.979 --> 07:53.779
And I'm tired of not having

07:53.846 --> 07:54.813
any girlfriends because they

07:54.881 --> 07:57.149
think I make them look bad.

07:57.216 --> 07:59.951
I just...I can't be perfect

08:00.019 --> 08:01.686
anymore.

08:01.754 --> 08:04.022
I want to be unperfect.

08:04.089 --> 08:05.490
Unperfect?

08:05.557 --> 08:07.992
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

08:09.894 --> 08:11.395
Well, that's the stupidest thing

08:11.462 --> 08:12.429
I ever heard.

08:13.364 --> 08:15.131
People come in here every day

08:15.199 --> 08:15.832
asking for what you have.

08:15.900 --> 08:17.133
They want your face.

08:17.201 --> 08:18.835
Well, I don't. Not any

08:18.903 --> 08:20.670
longer. It's just too much

08:20.738 --> 08:23.473
pressure, Dr. Troy. I feel like

08:23.541 --> 08:25.441
I'm onstage all the time.

08:25.509 --> 08:27.277
I even quit modeling, and that

08:27.344 --> 08:29.479
hasn't helped. Look, for once in

08:29.547 --> 08:30.980
my life, I just want to be able

08:31.048 --> 08:32.982
to walk down the street

08:33.049 --> 08:34.817
and be ignored.

08:34.885 --> 08:35.985
I want to be normal looking.

08:36.052 --> 08:37.720
I want to be average.

08:37.787 --> 08:38.386
What about putting on

08:38.455 --> 08:39.087
a couple of pounds? You know,

08:39.155 --> 08:40.255
a double cheeseburger,

08:40.323 --> 08:41.056
something like that.

08:41.124 --> 08:41.990
I don't eat red meat.

08:42.058 --> 08:43.024
Ice cream.

08:43.092 --> 08:44.092
I'm lactose intolerant.

08:44.159 --> 08:45.927
Jesus.

08:45.995 --> 08:47.128
You know what I'm talking about.

08:47.196 --> 08:48.963
Just take worse care of

08:49.031 --> 08:50.898
yourself. Like some nuts?

08:50.966 --> 08:51.799
No, thanks.

08:51.867 --> 08:53.067
Come on, you might enjoy it.

08:53.135 --> 08:54.235
Look, I said I wanted to be

08:54.303 --> 08:55.936
unbeautiful, not unhealthy.

08:56.004 --> 08:57.337
Ok.

08:57.405 --> 08:58.305
And I have tried to make

08:58.372 --> 08:59.838
superficial changes. I'm not

08:59.906 --> 09:01.105
wearing any make-up, I haven't

09:01.173 --> 09:02.805
washed my hair in like a week.

09:02.872 --> 09:03.738
I mean, look at what I'm

09:03.806 --> 09:04.972
wearing, for Christ sakes.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.273
And still, your parking valet

09:07.341 --> 09:07.939
gave me his phone number.

09:08.007 --> 09:10.473
Well, you'll just have to try

09:10.540 --> 09:11.871
a little harder, because looking

09:11.939 --> 09:13.271
the way you look, I would never

09:13.339 --> 09:14.371
touch you with a scalpel.

09:14.438 --> 09:16.203
And good luck finding a doctor

09:16.270 --> 09:19.502
who would.

09:29.770 --> 09:33.474
Phew.

09:33.542 --> 09:34.844
Hey.

09:34.912 --> 09:35.612
Hey.

09:35.680 --> 09:37.047
Oh, hello. Heh. Do you want

09:37.115 --> 09:37.949
me to come back?

09:38.017 --> 09:39.218
No, no, no. Come in, come in.

09:39.286 --> 09:40.353
You sure? Ok.

09:40.420 --> 09:41.187
I just got a little carried

09:41.254 --> 09:41.887
away.

09:41.955 --> 09:42.755
Working out?

09:42.822 --> 09:45.023
Yeah. It's kind of a metaphor

09:45.091 --> 09:46.391
for my life these days.

09:46.459 --> 09:47.292
You want some water?

09:47.359 --> 09:48.326
Oh, no, thanks. I'm good.

09:48.394 --> 09:49.393
I just keep running

09:49.461 --> 09:51.362
and running without a clue

09:51.429 --> 09:52.396
where I'm going.

09:52.463 --> 09:53.796
Well, at least you care about

09:53.864 --> 09:55.664
your health and your body.

09:55.732 --> 09:56.698
Christian's at home laying

09:56.766 --> 09:57.865
on the couch drinking beer

09:57.933 --> 09:59.533
like a fat slob. Seems he's

09:59.601 --> 10:00.567
given up.

10:00.635 --> 10:01.668
Well, maybe that's his way of

10:01.736 --> 10:02.768
saying he's happy.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.737
Or maybe it's his way of

10:04.805 --> 10:05.505
telling me he doesn't care

10:05.572 --> 10:06.972
what I think.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.375
Ah.

10:09.443 --> 10:10.510
Well, he is proud of you,

10:10.578 --> 10:11.444
Kimber.

10:11.512 --> 10:12.979
I suppose.

10:13.046 --> 10:15.547
Well, ok. I hope you like

10:15.614 --> 10:17.382
what I put together.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.283
Do you mind?

10:18.351 --> 10:20.318
No, no. Yeah, yeah.

10:20.385 --> 10:22.386
First one.

10:22.454 --> 10:25.288
Oh. Now, see, this is

10:25.356 --> 10:27.290
a little more Christian than me,

10:27.358 --> 10:29.258
don't you think?

10:29.326 --> 10:31.327
All right.

10:31.394 --> 10:34.029
Well, what are your tastes?

10:34.097 --> 10:35.530
Like, how would you describe

10:35.598 --> 10:37.565
Sean McNamara?

10:37.633 --> 10:39.100
Well, how would

10:39.167 --> 10:40.467
I know? I'm just a doctor.

10:40.535 --> 10:41.435
Well, you're more than that.

10:41.503 --> 10:43.937
What about like an artsy,

10:44.005 --> 10:45.772
intellectual, mid-century type

10:45.839 --> 10:46.739
of guy?

10:46.807 --> 10:48.674
Hmm.

10:48.742 --> 10:50.075
Hmm?

10:50.143 --> 10:52.944
Or you could do kind of a homey,

10:53.012 --> 10:54.912
kick-back, country French look?

10:54.980 --> 10:56.813
Look, do I need to go to

10:56.881 --> 10:58.081
therapy just to get some

10:58.149 --> 10:59.249
furniture for this place?

10:59.316 --> 11:00.583
That's why I hired you.

11:00.651 --> 11:03.251
No, it's just, in design

11:03.319 --> 11:05.319
school, they really emphasize on

11:05.387 --> 11:06.753
listening to the client.

11:06.821 --> 11:08.121
You know, like your likes,

11:08.188 --> 11:09.155
dislikes, colors.

11:09.222 --> 11:10.422
Yeah, well, this particular

11:10.490 --> 11:13.557
client has no self, it seems.

11:13.625 --> 11:15.158
He's arrived in his 45th year

11:15.226 --> 11:16.360
with no opinions or taste of his

11:16.427 --> 11:18.761
own. He spent too much time in

11:18.829 --> 11:20.195
everyone else's shadow.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.831
Kimber, just do your thing.

11:22.898 --> 11:24.298
You know, whatever you think.

11:24.366 --> 11:26.600
Let your imagination go,

11:26.667 --> 11:27.767
you have my permission.

11:27.835 --> 11:28.735
Yeah?

11:28.802 --> 11:30.903
Yeah.

11:30.970 --> 11:33.705
Ok. Well, I think I can do

11:33.772 --> 11:37.174
something in here.

11:37.241 --> 11:39.375
Thank you.

11:39.443 --> 11:41.244
I promise you, I'm going to blow

11:41.311 --> 11:43.346
you away with this place, ok?

11:43.414 --> 11:45.247
I have total faith in you.

11:45.315 --> 11:47.148
Thanks.

11:47.216 --> 11:48.116
I'll see you later.

11:48.183 --> 11:49.050
Ok.

11:49.117 --> 11:49.717
Bye.

11:49.784 --> 11:50.451
Bye.

11:50.518 --> 11:51.585
See ya.

11:51.652 --> 11:53.586
See ya.

12:07.865 --> 12:09.332
It really is a miracle.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.900
Oh, absolutely. 99% of comas

12:11.968 --> 12:13.268
that last more than three years

12:13.336 --> 12:14.269
are permanent.

12:14.336 --> 12:15.436
No, I mean because he can

12:15.504 --> 12:17.270
steal $40,000 from us just lying

12:17.338 --> 12:18.704
on this table.

12:18.772 --> 12:19.872
It's... it's miraculous.

12:19.939 --> 12:21.106
This is not a typical

12:21.174 --> 12:22.707
pro-Bono case.

12:22.775 --> 12:24.708
The wear and tear on his face

12:24.776 --> 12:26.743
is completely out of the norm

12:26.810 --> 12:28.711
because of his prone position.

12:28.778 --> 12:30.245
Ok, we're doing

12:30.313 --> 12:32.247
a rhytidectomy with an SMAS

12:32.315 --> 12:33.481
asplication.

12:33.549 --> 12:34.549
You're right.

12:34.616 --> 12:35.449
We can now corner the market

12:35.517 --> 12:37.584
on rip van winkles.

12:37.652 --> 12:40.353
Very impressive.

12:40.420 --> 12:41.787
Made up a lot of new expenses.

12:41.855 --> 12:42.921
You know, I'm just trying to be

12:42.989 --> 12:43.889
responsible.

12:43.956 --> 12:45.023
At this point in my life,

12:45.090 --> 12:46.391
I'm not compromising on work

12:46.458 --> 12:48.025
I find interesting and rewarding

12:48.093 --> 12:49.526
so you can have new toys.

12:49.594 --> 12:51.461
I don't know why you're worried

12:51.529 --> 12:53.362
about money. I just got Kimber's

12:53.430 --> 12:54.597
first bill.

12:54.664 --> 12:55.898
Well, unlike Mr. Kenny,

12:55.965 --> 12:57.432
you're not a charity case, ok?

12:57.500 --> 12:58.300
Did you think she was going

12:58.368 --> 12:59.268
to work for free?

12:59.336 --> 13:00.503
There's a difference between

13:00.571 --> 13:02.340
pro-bono and bleeding me dry.

13:02.408 --> 13:04.242
I'm her first client, and I only

13:04.310 --> 13:06.545
hired her as a favor to you.

13:06.613 --> 13:07.846
You know, if I had have known

13:07.914 --> 13:09.380
you'd be such a pain in the ass,

13:09.448 --> 13:10.281
I never would have suggested it

13:10.349 --> 13:11.550
in the first place.

13:11.618 --> 13:13.521
You know what?

13:13.589 --> 13:15.359
Why don't you just leave?

13:15.426 --> 13:16.461
Huh?

13:16.529 --> 13:17.329
I'd like to finish this

13:17.397 --> 13:18.298
on my own.

13:18.366 --> 13:19.300
Are you serious?

13:19.368 --> 13:20.369
I'm tired of the witty banter

13:20.437 --> 13:21.705
and the back and forth and you

13:21.772 --> 13:22.806
telling me all the ways I'm

13:22.874 --> 13:24.207
making your life more difficult.

13:24.275 --> 13:25.309
If you don't mind, I'd like to

13:25.377 --> 13:26.744
spend some time focusing on

13:26.812 --> 13:28.179
my work.

13:28.247 --> 13:30.248
Are you serious?

13:30.316 --> 13:32.750
Yes.

13:37.123 --> 13:39.325
Hmm.

13:52.556 --> 13:53.289
Jesus!

13:53.356 --> 13:54.322
Wait a second, don't push it.

13:54.389 --> 13:55.389
It's gonna get dirty.

13:55.457 --> 13:56.757
Don't tell me you're redoing

13:56.824 --> 13:57.824
the living room again.

13:57.892 --> 13:59.425
No, no, this is for Sean.

13:59.493 --> 14:00.559
I have to go there later

14:00.627 --> 14:01.393
and finish.

14:01.461 --> 14:02.628
Well, I thought we were going

14:02.696 --> 14:03.562
to stay home and watch some

14:03.630 --> 14:04.463
television together.

14:04.531 --> 14:05.664
Honey, I told you, I have

14:05.732 --> 14:07.398
a client deadline.

14:07.466 --> 14:09.166
Client?

14:09.234 --> 14:10.367
He's not a client, he's Sean.

14:10.435 --> 14:11.802
The only reason he gave you

14:11.870 --> 14:12.804
the job was because I asked him

14:12.871 --> 14:15.172
to in the first place.

14:15.240 --> 14:16.840
Well, that's not what

14:16.908 --> 14:18.775
he told me.

14:20.677 --> 14:22.578
Ok.

14:22.646 --> 14:25.147
Damn it, I can't find

14:25.215 --> 14:27.249
the swatches.

14:27.316 --> 14:28.883
Christian, why do you have to

14:28.951 --> 14:31.418
ruin everything for me?

14:31.486 --> 14:32.452
Look, I told Sean to call you

14:32.519 --> 14:33.386
before you got booked up,

14:33.454 --> 14:35.857
that's all, all right?

14:35.924 --> 14:37.492
This is exactly what I was

14:37.560 --> 14:38.793
worried about, by the way.

14:38.861 --> 14:39.828
I mean, you working again was

14:39.895 --> 14:40.995
supposed to make you feel happy,

14:41.063 --> 14:43.097
not miserable. Now you feel

14:43.165 --> 14:44.765
miserable and I feel miserable,

14:44.833 --> 14:46.433
and...

14:46.501 --> 14:50.436
It's not good.

14:50.504 --> 14:53.039
Maybe we should spend more time

14:53.106 --> 14:54.440
together or something.

14:56.510 --> 14:57.309
And how are we going to spend

14:57.377 --> 14:58.444
time together with that giant

14:58.511 --> 15:00.679
gut of yours in between us?

15:00.747 --> 15:04.014
What?

15:04.082 --> 15:05.949
I have a gut?

15:06.017 --> 15:07.283
And that stubble you've got

15:07.351 --> 15:08.417
going on? You think I like that

15:08.484 --> 15:10.518
rubbing in between my legs?

15:10.586 --> 15:11.418
I thought

15:11.486 --> 15:12.119
you liked the beard.

15:12.187 --> 15:12.919
I'm not talking about your

15:12.987 --> 15:13.987
beard, Christian. I'm talking

15:14.055 --> 15:15.154
about your balls. You used to

15:15.222 --> 15:16.489
shave them for me.

15:16.556 --> 15:19.091
Now I'm lucky if you even run

15:19.158 --> 15:21.125
a comb through your hair

15:21.193 --> 15:23.293
before you leave the house.

15:23.361 --> 15:26.562
This whole new Christian look

15:26.629 --> 15:28.965
isn't exactly working for me.

15:29.032 --> 15:30.501
So maybe if you could rediscover

15:30.569 --> 15:31.869
a brush, or, I don't know, maybe

15:31.937 --> 15:33.103
a razor...

15:33.171 --> 15:34.872
Until then, you're not doing me

15:34.940 --> 15:36.775
either, ok?

15:36.843 --> 15:39.010
Oh, don't wait up for me,

15:39.078 --> 15:41.812
'cause I'm gonna be late.

15:55.291 --> 15:57.191
You look good.

15:57.259 --> 15:59.226
Hey. Ah.

15:59.294 --> 16:02.228
Sorry. I, uh... Linda gave me

16:02.296 --> 16:04.296
this, and... I used to think

16:04.363 --> 16:05.763
the walkman was cool.

16:05.831 --> 16:07.531
Have a seat.

16:07.599 --> 16:09.566
I want a last little look,

16:09.634 --> 16:10.900
send you on your way

16:10.968 --> 16:13.369
with a clean bill of health.

16:13.436 --> 16:14.770
My mom started crying when

16:14.837 --> 16:15.937
she looked at me. She said

16:16.005 --> 16:16.672
looking at me made her feel

16:16.739 --> 16:18.006
20 years younger.

16:18.073 --> 16:19.640
Well, I don't know about 20.

16:19.708 --> 16:22.110
But we definitely chopped off

16:22.178 --> 16:23.846
at least 10.

16:23.914 --> 16:27.216
So, what's next on your agenda?

16:27.284 --> 16:28.784
It's all pretty weird.

16:28.851 --> 16:30.785
All my friends have grown

16:30.853 --> 16:33.087
and have families and careers,

16:33.155 --> 16:34.588
and a lot of them have moved

16:34.656 --> 16:37.224
away. So I really want to meet

16:37.291 --> 16:38.658
someone my own age.

16:38.725 --> 16:40.292
Early twenties, maybe. I don't

16:40.360 --> 16:42.227
want to aim too high. But

16:42.294 --> 16:43.894
I figured I'd go to the clubs

16:43.962 --> 16:46.663
and see if I was any better

16:46.730 --> 16:49.365
of a dancer than I used to be.

16:49.432 --> 16:51.333
Any suggestions?

16:51.401 --> 16:52.601
No, not really.

16:52.669 --> 16:54.502
I travel in a slightly older

16:54.570 --> 16:55.503
circle.

16:55.571 --> 16:57.538
Oh.

17:00.308 --> 17:01.875
Best of luck, though.

17:01.943 --> 17:05.078
Thank you.

17:05.146 --> 17:08.446
I feel like a freak.

17:08.515 --> 17:11.683
I have no idea what girls like

17:11.751 --> 17:13.885
today. You know, texting,

17:13.952 --> 17:16.520
cell phones, Google.

17:16.587 --> 17:19.390
It's all pretty...

17:19.458 --> 17:21.358
Nerve wracking.

17:21.425 --> 17:22.792
Well, it's kind of like

17:22.861 --> 17:23.894
riding a bike. I'm sure you'll

17:23.962 --> 17:24.862
be fine.

17:24.929 --> 17:25.796
Except I've never ridden

17:25.864 --> 17:28.198
a bike. So to speak.

17:28.265 --> 17:30.566
So you're...

17:30.634 --> 17:32.935
Yeah. A 40-year-old virgin.

17:33.003 --> 17:35.570
Oh. Could have been worse.

17:35.638 --> 17:36.872
Could have died one.

17:36.939 --> 17:39.374
I know a place that you might

17:39.442 --> 17:42.144
like. They even let old guys

17:42.211 --> 17:44.345
like me in.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.150
Oh. Hi.

17:49.218 --> 17:50.185
Hi.

17:50.252 --> 17:52.386
Um, did you come find me to

17:52.454 --> 17:53.888
tell me that you changed your

17:53.956 --> 17:55.290
mind about my surgery, or...

17:55.357 --> 17:56.824
No, actually, I came to

17:56.892 --> 17:58.092
change your mind about

17:58.160 --> 17:59.126
the surgery.

17:59.194 --> 18:00.127
That won't happen.

18:00.195 --> 18:01.094
I already have two more

18:01.162 --> 18:02.229
appointments with plastic

18:02.296 --> 18:03.663
surgeons next week, Dr. Troy.

18:03.731 --> 18:04.431
So...

18:04.498 --> 18:05.265
you can call me Christian.

18:05.332 --> 18:06.299
Hmm.

18:06.366 --> 18:07.433
I'm not here as your doctor.

18:08.902 --> 18:11.003
You do like wine, don't you?

18:11.070 --> 18:13.372
Yeah.

18:13.439 --> 18:14.640
Yeah? Well, this is, uh,

18:14.707 --> 18:16.808
really nice. Goes perfectly

18:16.876 --> 18:19.511
with the colonel's special

18:19.579 --> 18:21.847
recipe.

18:21.914 --> 18:22.948
I've already eaten,

18:23.015 --> 18:24.015
but thank you.

18:24.083 --> 18:25.283
Oh, ok. Well,

18:25.351 --> 18:28.753
that's more for me.

18:28.821 --> 18:30.855
What are you doing?

18:30.923 --> 18:31.923
Huh?

18:31.991 --> 18:32.590
You know, it's Saturday

18:32.658 --> 18:33.524
night. How do you know

18:33.592 --> 18:34.292
I'm not going out?

18:34.359 --> 18:35.126
You don't like aggressive

18:35.194 --> 18:36.494
men, and there's more aggressive

18:36.561 --> 18:38.095
and drunk men out on a Saturday

18:38.163 --> 18:39.163
night than any other night

18:39.231 --> 18:40.765
of the week. So why don't you do

18:40.833 --> 18:42.066
us both a favor, just quit your

18:42.134 --> 18:43.534
yappin', grab a couple

18:43.602 --> 18:44.602
of glasses and a corkscrew,

18:44.670 --> 18:45.870
and come sit your little ass

18:45.937 --> 18:47.104
down on the couch.

18:47.172 --> 18:48.306
Seems like I don't have to go

18:48.373 --> 18:50.608
out to find an aggressive man.

18:50.676 --> 18:54.545
Ok. Come to papa.

18:54.613 --> 18:57.114
Ha ha ha.

18:57.182 --> 18:59.049
Ah.

19:00.752 --> 19:03.087
Ahh.

19:03.154 --> 19:04.188
I don't think I've had fried

19:04.256 --> 19:05.522
chicken since I was in, like,

19:05.590 --> 19:08.490
high school.

19:08.557 --> 19:09.523
But at least you're removing

19:09.591 --> 19:10.457
the skin. That's where

19:10.525 --> 19:11.491
all the fat is.

19:11.559 --> 19:12.859
That's where all the taste

19:12.926 --> 19:15.924
is. Ahh.

19:15.991 --> 19:17.891
Ok.

19:17.959 --> 19:19.491
Mmm.

19:19.559 --> 19:20.325
Ugh.

19:20.392 --> 19:24.060
Mmm.

19:24.128 --> 19:25.828
Mmm.

19:25.896 --> 19:27.963
Woh.

19:28.031 --> 19:29.164
Are you sure you don't want to

19:29.232 --> 19:30.232
try some of this?

19:30.300 --> 19:31.933
Yeah, no.

19:32.001 --> 19:34.002
Mmm. Mmm.

19:34.069 --> 19:37.338
Ok. Give me one of those.

19:37.405 --> 19:39.306
Mm-hmm.

19:53.886 --> 19:57.221
The music's pretty cool.

19:57.288 --> 19:58.455
What is this?

19:58.523 --> 19:59.556
To tell you the truth,

19:59.624 --> 20:00.557
I think the last time I bought

20:00.625 --> 20:02.726
a cd, you were still awake.

20:02.794 --> 20:04.061
I'm mostly into pop music

20:04.128 --> 20:05.328
from the late eighties.

20:05.396 --> 20:07.361
You know, Phil Collins,

20:07.429 --> 20:08.428
Richard Marx. There was

20:08.496 --> 20:09.462
an innocence to it.

20:09.530 --> 20:11.364
It sucked.

20:11.432 --> 20:12.498
The girls dress a lot better

20:12.566 --> 20:13.633
now, though.

20:13.700 --> 20:15.401
Yeah.

20:15.469 --> 20:17.569
You woke up at just the right

20:17.637 --> 20:19.771
time. This is the slut

20:19.839 --> 20:22.306
generation. Most of these girls,

20:22.373 --> 20:24.407
their role models are famous for

20:24.475 --> 20:26.442
having sex tapes.

20:26.510 --> 20:28.577
My partner's really the expert

20:28.645 --> 20:30.512
in these places.

20:30.580 --> 20:32.848
Well, what would you do now?

20:41.088 --> 20:43.990
Hi. I'm Dr. Sean McNamara.

20:44.058 --> 20:45.558
I'm a plastic surgeon.

20:45.626 --> 20:48.160
Are you guys narcs?

20:53.099 --> 20:54.966
What do we do now?

20:55.034 --> 20:56.868
Now we get drunk.

20:56.935 --> 21:00.204
Tequila. Best you have.

21:05.975 --> 21:07.175
Mmm.

21:07.243 --> 21:08.275
Tomorrow, I'm introducing you

21:08.343 --> 21:09.710
to a triple stuft burrito

21:09.778 --> 21:10.577
with sour cream.

21:10.645 --> 21:11.512
I think we should buy

21:11.579 --> 21:12.946
a KFC franchise together.

21:13.014 --> 21:14.080
Mmm.

21:14.148 --> 21:14.914
Settle down somewhere

21:14.982 --> 21:16.816
like...Fresno. And never be

21:16.884 --> 21:18.284
heard from again.

21:19.286 --> 21:21.053
Sounds good.

21:21.121 --> 21:23.488
Fat and happy ever after.

21:23.556 --> 21:25.556
Fat and happy. And ugly.

21:25.624 --> 21:28.225
Mmm.

21:40.603 --> 21:42.704
Uh, wait a second.

21:42.771 --> 21:44.705
I have an idea.

21:49.110 --> 21:51.111
Ohh.

21:58.985 --> 21:59.818
You better not be puking your

21:59.886 --> 22:03.087
guts out in there.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.356
You don't have anything sweet,

22:05.423 --> 22:07.858
do you?

22:15.830 --> 22:17.197
So what do you think?

22:17.265 --> 22:21.600
Hmm?

22:21.667 --> 22:24.402
Holy shit.

22:24.469 --> 22:27.170
Yeah. I can't believe

22:27.238 --> 22:29.005
I did it. But I did it.

22:29.072 --> 22:32.107
It worked.

22:32.175 --> 22:34.575
I'm ugly, right?

22:34.643 --> 22:38.678
You're, um, impulsive.

22:38.746 --> 22:41.546
Which is very hot.

22:41.614 --> 22:45.349
Ahh.

23:17.619 --> 23:20.990
This place is awesome!

23:21.058 --> 23:24.793
Hey, how are you doing?

23:50.548 --> 23:52.816
Hey.

23:52.884 --> 23:54.318
I gotta... I gotta get out of

23:54.385 --> 23:57.854
here. You stay, I'm gonna go.

24:26.976 --> 24:30.077
What the hell...

24:33.547 --> 24:34.914
Oh, hey.

24:34.982 --> 24:36.015
Oh, I didn't know

24:36.083 --> 24:37.016
you'd still be here.

24:37.084 --> 24:37.950
Oh, well, it took a lot

24:38.018 --> 24:38.717
longer than I thought it was

24:38.785 --> 24:40.185
going to. Actually, the movers

24:40.253 --> 24:41.319
just left.

24:41.387 --> 24:43.423
So what do you think?

24:46.491 --> 24:47.959
Oh, you hate it.

24:48.527 --> 24:50.260
Oh.

24:50.328 --> 24:52.195
This is how you see me?

24:52.263 --> 24:54.125
Well, old-fashioned gentleman

24:54.192 --> 24:57.707
with a hint of old-world

24:57.765 --> 24:59.742
glamour, yeah.

24:59.809 --> 25:02.184
Old-fashioned. Old world.

25:02.252 --> 25:04.713
Old pretty much says it, right?

25:04.780 --> 25:06.269
Sean...

25:06.337 --> 25:08.560
Think of Clark Gable.

25:08.628 --> 25:11.580
Or Rudolph Valentino.

25:11.643 --> 25:12.871
If those guys had a bachelor

25:12.939 --> 25:14.134
pad, they'd totally decorate it

25:14.202 --> 25:15.597
like this.

25:18.319 --> 25:21.634
All right, you hate it.

25:27.248 --> 25:28.538
I'm sorry if it's not what you

25:28.605 --> 25:30.896
wanted. I just wanted to make

25:30.964 --> 25:33.984
you feel special.

25:43.214 --> 25:45.967
Kimber...

25:46.035 --> 25:47.163
So caught up in myself,

25:47.231 --> 25:49.983
I wasn't thinking.

25:50.051 --> 25:52.275
You know, now that I'm really

25:52.343 --> 25:53.666
looking at it, it is pretty

25:53.734 --> 25:54.962
great.

25:55.030 --> 25:57.483
You got me, or somebody

25:57.551 --> 25:59.346
I'd like to be.

25:59.409 --> 26:00.704
Yeah, now you're just

26:00.772 --> 26:01.633
saying that.

26:01.701 --> 26:03.129
No, no, no. Hey. It's

26:03.197 --> 26:04.326
completely different from

26:04.388 --> 26:05.850
anything I could have imagined.

26:05.918 --> 26:09.333
But strangely...right.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.625
I think I'll like coming home

26:11.693 --> 26:12.755
to this.

26:12.822 --> 26:14.151
Yeah?

26:14.219 --> 26:14.880
Yeah.

26:14.947 --> 26:16.438
Oh, that's great.

26:16.506 --> 26:18.830
Oh, Sean, thank you.

26:18.898 --> 26:21.516
Ohh.

26:21.583 --> 26:24.175
My God, you have no idea how

26:24.242 --> 26:26.795
hard I have worked on this.

26:26.863 --> 26:27.857
Well, you are talented,

26:27.925 --> 26:29.187
Kimber.

26:29.249 --> 26:31.078
Well, tell that to Christian.

26:31.146 --> 26:32.736
He hates how I redid

26:32.804 --> 26:34.928
the house. Our house, whatever.

26:34.996 --> 26:36.319
Well, he can be tough.

26:36.387 --> 26:37.382
I'm terrified of making

26:37.450 --> 26:38.645
mistakes, right? Like,

26:38.712 --> 26:40.636
I completely lose my instincts.

26:40.704 --> 26:42.894
I don't know who he is.

26:42.962 --> 26:45.120
I don't know who I am, or...

26:45.182 --> 26:47.340
Us as a couple. It's just so

26:47.407 --> 26:49.765
frustrating. But thanks for

26:49.833 --> 26:51.256
being sweet and making me feel

26:51.324 --> 26:53.214
confident.

26:53.282 --> 26:54.444
Doesn't take much.

26:54.512 --> 26:56.169
A little sunshine, a little

26:56.236 --> 26:59.189
watering. Look what you did.

26:59.257 --> 27:04.235
Well...

27:04.302 --> 27:07.489
Um, you know, I did the library

27:07.557 --> 27:09.380
back there, and it has this

27:09.448 --> 27:13.263
beautiful, dark carved wood...

27:16.852 --> 27:20.101
Show me the bedroom first.

27:20.168 --> 27:22.193
Mmm.

27:22.260 --> 27:24.185
Mmm.

27:33.071 --> 27:35.004
I came here to tell you that

27:35.072 --> 27:36.238
we can't do this again!

27:36.306 --> 27:37.539
Oh, yeah, we can't do this

27:37.607 --> 27:38.573
anymore, you're right.

27:38.641 --> 27:39.874
I mean, like, we're bad.

27:39.942 --> 27:41.475
Like, this is really bad.

27:41.543 --> 27:42.709
I know.

27:42.777 --> 27:43.977
The worst. How come I don't

27:44.044 --> 27:44.811
feel guilty?

27:44.878 --> 27:45.978
Ooh!

27:46.046 --> 27:48.048
Oh!

27:48.116 --> 27:49.718
Oh!

27:51.221 --> 27:52.854
Is that him? Is that Christian?

27:52.922 --> 27:54.922
Yeah. We're only separated

27:54.989 --> 27:56.222
by this wall.

27:56.290 --> 27:58.657
Oh, I like it.

27:58.725 --> 28:00.392
Oh!

28:03.028 --> 28:05.129
Not even fast food?

28:05.196 --> 28:06.999
You gotta eat.

28:07.067 --> 28:08.334
Why do you need to go to

28:08.402 --> 28:09.535
?

28:09.604 --> 28:10.805
I'll be back in a flash.

28:10.873 --> 28:11.874
A flash?

28:11.942 --> 28:12.643
Mm-hmm.

28:12.711 --> 28:14.645
Come on. Big old burrito

28:14.712 --> 28:16.312
smothered in guacamole

28:16.380 --> 28:19.148
and sour cream.

28:19.216 --> 28:22.618
Ok. Pull the car out front.

28:22.686 --> 28:26.389
Meet you downstairs.

28:26.456 --> 28:28.658
Ahh.

28:36.932 --> 28:38.832
Sean, who the hell you

28:38.900 --> 28:41.402
banging in there?

28:41.470 --> 28:42.603
Oh, just your wife,

28:42.671 --> 28:44.171
sweetheart.

28:44.239 --> 28:46.170
Hey, what's up?

28:49.106 --> 28:49.705
What the hell

28:49.773 --> 28:50.540
are you doing here?

28:50.607 --> 28:51.407
Well, she's doing such a good

28:51.474 --> 28:52.307
job on the apartment, I wanted

28:52.375 --> 28:54.042
to ask her advice on a new desk.

28:54.109 --> 28:55.542
Tired of glass.

28:55.610 --> 28:57.543
I want to warm it up in here.

28:57.611 --> 28:59.245
Why was it locked?

28:59.312 --> 29:01.612
Um, oh, I had just mentioned

29:01.680 --> 29:03.514
to Sean about the new brush

29:03.582 --> 29:05.015
nickel door hardware, and so

29:05.083 --> 29:06.682
I must have just, you know,

29:06.750 --> 29:07.583
hit the button.

29:07.651 --> 29:08.517
Brush nickel?

29:08.585 --> 29:09.584
Hmm.

29:09.652 --> 29:10.619
Look, no changes

29:10.687 --> 29:12.821
without me, ok?

29:12.889 --> 29:14.924
I gotta go take care of

29:14.991 --> 29:16.259
something I forgot to take care

29:16.327 --> 29:19.330
of before. And if I'm not back

29:19.397 --> 29:20.566
in time, just start surgery

29:20.634 --> 29:21.934
without me, ok?

29:22.002 --> 29:23.936
Ahem.

29:26.073 --> 29:28.209
No changes without my ok?

29:28.276 --> 29:30.211
What kind of ego trip is he on?

29:30.279 --> 29:31.145
Well, it's always gotta be

29:31.213 --> 29:32.446
the Christian Troy show,

29:32.514 --> 29:34.314
even my office. You were very

29:34.382 --> 29:35.382
cool, my dear.

29:35.450 --> 29:37.584
Mmm, well, it's all my years

29:37.652 --> 29:38.651
of acting.

29:38.719 --> 29:39.986
Yes.

29:40.054 --> 29:40.987
Mmm.

29:41.055 --> 29:42.489
Ok, so, Sean, um,

29:42.557 --> 29:43.690
I'll get you some tear sheets

29:43.758 --> 29:46.025
on the wood desks.

29:50.997 --> 29:52.130
For this stuff,

29:52.198 --> 29:53.398
you need to be yob.

29:53.466 --> 29:54.799
I don't drink beer, remember.

29:54.867 --> 29:56.633
I mean bring your own beano.

29:56.701 --> 29:58.134
Eating like a pig is one thing.

29:58.202 --> 29:59.469
Smelling like them is another,

29:59.536 --> 30:00.802
ok? Stinky women are

30:00.870 --> 30:01.903
a real turn off.

30:01.971 --> 30:03.371
I'll keep that in mind.

30:03.439 --> 30:06.373
Ah.

30:06.440 --> 30:10.909
All right. We got everything.

30:10.977 --> 30:12.277
When do you have to be back

30:12.344 --> 30:13.211
at work?

30:13.278 --> 30:15.412
Whenever. It's not like my

30:15.479 --> 30:16.979
partner has anywhere else to go.

30:17.047 --> 30:19.082
Then let's hit a matinee.

30:19.150 --> 30:20.817
We'll waste the whole afternoon.

30:20.884 --> 30:22.551
You know, a movie theater

30:22.619 --> 30:24.053
is the only place I can really

30:24.121 --> 30:25.921
relax.

30:25.989 --> 30:26.988
Because you sit in the dark

30:27.056 --> 30:28.189
and nobody bothers you, or...

30:28.257 --> 30:29.690
Maybe.

30:29.758 --> 30:32.092
Maybe I just like juju fruits.

30:44.804 --> 30:45.737
.. Alien nation!

30:55.180 --> 30:57.281
That's right! Aye!

30:57.349 --> 30:58.449
Hey, have a little respect,

30:58.516 --> 30:59.883
Buddy boy.

31:04.855 --> 31:06.956
Whoa!

31:07.024 --> 31:09.425
Go! Go!

31:16.898 --> 31:18.598
You know, uh,

31:18.666 --> 31:21.068
you can slow down now.

31:21.135 --> 31:22.702
You can't do anything

31:22.770 --> 31:24.437
to change myself.

31:24.504 --> 31:26.903
I'm so sick of this face.

31:29.940 --> 31:31.306
Jesus! What are you doing,

31:31.374 --> 31:33.375
you crazy bitch?!

31:34.810 --> 31:35.543
If you want to kill yourself,

31:35.611 --> 31:36.377
fine, all right, but just let me

31:36.445 --> 31:37.411
out of the car!

31:37.479 --> 31:38.879
Sorry, Christian.

31:38.947 --> 31:39.847
That's the only thing left

31:39.914 --> 31:41.215
for me to do!

31:41.283 --> 31:41.916
Please stop the car,

31:41.983 --> 31:43.150
please stop the car!

31:43.218 --> 31:45.118
Jesus, Jesus! Stop!

31:59.167 --> 32:00.066
Those guys at the E.R.

32:00.134 --> 32:01.300
Were awesome, by the way.

32:01.368 --> 32:02.270
She's lucky she's alive.

32:04.238 --> 32:06.039
What a crazy bitch.

32:07.107 --> 32:08.375
You're driving me bat shit,

32:08.443 --> 32:09.176
Sean.

32:09.244 --> 32:10.110
Don't move.

32:10.178 --> 32:11.077
Oh, Jesus. Like waiting to

32:11.145 --> 32:11.945
get a shot, the anticipation

32:12.012 --> 32:13.679
is worse than the actual needle.

32:13.747 --> 32:14.647
Just go ahead and say it, all

32:14.715 --> 32:16.115
right? I think with my dick.

32:16.183 --> 32:17.383
I am a dick. Ok, say it.

32:17.450 --> 32:19.151
It's none of my business.

32:19.219 --> 32:20.753
Since when is me screwing up

32:20.820 --> 32:22.187
none of your business, huh?

32:22.255 --> 32:23.622
You thrive on it.

32:23.689 --> 32:25.390
That should heal without

32:25.458 --> 32:26.324
a scar.

32:26.392 --> 32:28.759
I know you. You can pretend

32:28.826 --> 32:30.260
you don't care.

32:30.328 --> 32:33.797
But I know you do.

32:33.865 --> 32:38.101
That may have been true once.

32:38.169 --> 32:40.003
Come on, you can't tell me

32:40.070 --> 32:41.170
you don't want to know

32:41.238 --> 32:42.505
what happened.

32:42.572 --> 32:44.206
I think I'll leave that for

32:44.274 --> 32:46.741
Kimber to ask. She's your wife.

32:46.809 --> 32:47.976
She's the one who might be

32:48.043 --> 32:48.944
curious.

32:49.011 --> 32:50.078
She's the one who pushed me

32:50.146 --> 32:51.746
out of the goddamn door.

32:51.814 --> 32:55.482
Ahem.

32:55.549 --> 32:58.050
So tell me...

32:58.118 --> 33:00.385
Is there anything about me

33:00.453 --> 33:03.520
that you still like?

33:03.588 --> 33:06.890
I don't think so.

33:06.958 --> 33:08.258
You're a self-righteous

33:08.326 --> 33:11.460
little prick, you know that?

33:11.528 --> 33:13.229
Did it ever occur to you that

33:13.297 --> 33:14.363
maybe it's you who needs me to

33:14.431 --> 33:15.631
be angry at you?

33:15.699 --> 33:16.399
Quite frankly, it never

33:16.466 --> 33:17.533
occurred to me.

33:17.600 --> 33:18.267
Good, 'cause I'm done

33:18.334 --> 33:19.134
being a substitute

33:19.202 --> 33:20.901
for your conscience.

33:20.969 --> 33:24.672
I know you can't change.

33:24.740 --> 33:27.508
Phhtt.

33:30.144 --> 33:32.713
So we met at the club.

33:32.781 --> 33:35.049
It was love at first sight.

33:35.116 --> 33:36.083
But then when he told me his

33:36.151 --> 33:37.484
story, oh, my God, imagine

33:37.552 --> 33:38.418
how much fun it will be to teach

33:38.486 --> 33:39.987
him all about the last 20 years.

33:40.054 --> 33:41.588
Obama and Britney. All that

33:41.656 --> 33:43.290
stuff.

33:43.358 --> 33:45.959
Well, I don't understand,

33:46.027 --> 33:47.527
Rupert. You don't need my

33:47.628 --> 33:48.961
consent to have a girlfriend.

33:49.029 --> 33:50.862
Oh, fiancÃ©e. We're engaged.

33:50.930 --> 33:53.165
Well, engaged to be engaged.

33:53.233 --> 33:54.900
I want to get McKenzie

33:54.968 --> 33:56.034
breast implants.

33:56.102 --> 33:57.902
A diamond is more

33:57.970 --> 33:59.603
traditional.

33:59.670 --> 34:00.337
My right one's a little

34:00.404 --> 34:01.637
smaller, and it's sort of has

34:01.704 --> 34:03.104
that pancake thing going on.

34:03.172 --> 34:04.239
It's been a struggle

34:04.307 --> 34:05.440
her whole life.

34:05.508 --> 34:06.575
Rupert, can I speak to you

34:06.642 --> 34:08.610
alone for a moment?

34:13.983 --> 34:15.014
She's awesome, isn't she?

34:15.083 --> 34:15.848
She's using you.

34:15.916 --> 34:16.915
Dude, you're wrong.

34:17.016 --> 34:17.882
We've been doing it nonstop

34:17.949 --> 34:18.882
for like two days straight.

34:18.951 --> 34:21.418
Yeah, sex is not love, ok?

34:21.485 --> 34:22.286
It's usually not even

34:22.353 --> 34:23.386
an expression of love.

34:23.454 --> 34:24.888
Sometimes women and men use it

34:24.955 --> 34:26.621
for less than innocent purposes.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.024
You're just a kid. You've been

34:28.091 --> 34:29.491
asleep for 20 years. You don't

34:29.559 --> 34:30.859
understand how women work.

34:30.927 --> 34:32.260
Oh, you do? I saw your moves

34:32.328 --> 34:32.960
on the dance floor,

34:33.029 --> 34:34.228
it was pretty mediocre.

34:34.295 --> 34:35.463
I was married for 20 years.

34:35.531 --> 34:36.464
How'd that turn out?

34:36.531 --> 34:37.797
Look, I've slept with plenty

34:37.866 --> 34:38.732
of women. The good ones don't

34:38.800 --> 34:39.866
ask you to buy them new breasts

34:39.934 --> 34:40.801
on the first date.

34:40.868 --> 34:41.900
Well, look, thank you for

34:41.969 --> 34:43.034
caring, but I'm going to do

34:43.103 --> 34:44.870
this. So do you want my business

34:44.938 --> 34:46.472
or what?

34:46.539 --> 34:48.641
Ok. I'll just go get

34:48.708 --> 34:50.108
a couple of samples.

34:50.176 --> 34:51.176
I assume she wants Ds?

34:51.244 --> 34:52.510
Yeah! How'd you know that?

34:52.578 --> 34:54.512
They always want Ds.

35:09.258 --> 35:10.591
Something's wrong with him!

35:10.659 --> 35:11.825
I didn't touch him, I swear.

35:11.893 --> 35:12.759
I just wanted new tits,

35:12.827 --> 35:14.960
I didn't touch him!

35:22.270 --> 35:24.305
He slipped back into a coma.

35:24.373 --> 35:25.906
Well, when is he going

35:25.974 --> 35:28.442
to wake up?

35:49.260 --> 35:51.861
Oh, my God! Baby,

35:51.929 --> 35:53.162
what happened to you?

35:53.230 --> 35:54.163
Your face!

35:54.231 --> 35:55.664
I'm fine.

35:55.731 --> 35:56.999
Your arm...

35:57.066 --> 35:58.767
I'm fine. Seriously, I just...

35:58.835 --> 36:00.402
a few scrapes, I was in

36:00.470 --> 36:02.370
an accident. I tried calling

36:02.438 --> 36:03.971
you. You didn't pick up

36:04.039 --> 36:05.473
your phone.

36:05.540 --> 36:06.474
I was... I'm sorry...

36:06.541 --> 36:07.307
why didn't you pick up

36:07.375 --> 36:08.141
your phone? You always pick up

36:08.209 --> 36:09.342
your phone when I call you.

36:09.410 --> 36:10.443
I'm sorry, I don't...

36:10.511 --> 36:11.577
you ignoring me?

36:11.612 --> 36:12.845
No.

36:12.913 --> 36:14.480
I get it.

36:14.548 --> 36:15.581
I've been such an asshole

36:15.648 --> 36:19.518
lately. Especially with that

36:19.586 --> 36:21.987
thing with Sean.

36:22.055 --> 36:24.756
What thing with Sean?

36:26.526 --> 36:28.827
He's your first real client,

36:28.895 --> 36:30.629
and I...

36:30.696 --> 36:32.497
I should...

36:32.565 --> 36:34.032
I should be supporting you,

36:34.099 --> 36:36.900
and I'm not, and I'm sorry.

36:36.968 --> 36:40.069
Oh, honey.

36:40.136 --> 36:42.503
You don't have to apologize.

36:42.571 --> 36:48.139
No, I do. I'm sorry, ok?

36:48.207 --> 36:49.873
Well...

36:49.941 --> 36:50.941
Please.

36:51.008 --> 36:52.876
Um, ok.

36:52.943 --> 36:56.512
Where's your car? Is it totaled?

36:56.580 --> 36:58.247
No, it wasn't my car.

36:58.315 --> 36:59.248
I was a passenger in somebody

36:59.282 --> 37:00.949
else's car.

37:04.253 --> 37:06.420
Well, are they ok?

37:06.488 --> 37:07.488
Who was it?

37:07.555 --> 37:08.989
They're fine. I mean,

37:09.057 --> 37:10.624
I think, you know. It was

37:10.691 --> 37:13.126
a client, Willow Banks.

37:13.194 --> 37:15.428
The model?

37:15.496 --> 37:17.496
Yeah.

37:17.564 --> 37:20.999
Yeah.

37:21.067 --> 37:24.235
You were in a car

37:24.303 --> 37:25.536
with Willow Banks during

37:25.604 --> 37:27.338
the day, and you were supposed

37:27.406 --> 37:29.339
to be at work?

37:29.407 --> 37:33.609
Mm-hmm.

37:33.677 --> 37:35.343
Good news is that I didn't have

37:35.411 --> 37:36.744
any lunch, so, ha.

37:36.812 --> 37:41.514
I think I lost about 5 pounds.

37:45.851 --> 37:48.886
Maybe I should go take a shower.

37:48.954 --> 37:50.921
Maybe you should make it

37:50.989 --> 37:52.922
a cold one.

38:18.550 --> 38:19.917
I guess it worked

38:19.985 --> 38:21.419
after all, huh?

38:21.486 --> 38:23.321
I wanted people to stop looking.

38:23.388 --> 38:25.289
And now after they do,

38:25.357 --> 38:26.657
they turn away. Just like you

38:26.725 --> 38:28.292
did. With their eyes full of

38:28.360 --> 38:31.295
pity and disgust. They still

38:31.363 --> 38:33.430
don't see me.

38:33.498 --> 38:36.467
Well, I guess going through

38:36.535 --> 38:39.236
a windshield at 110 miles

38:39.304 --> 38:40.871
an hour was the answer all

38:40.939 --> 38:42.739
along, huh? Who knew?

38:42.807 --> 38:45.509
I need to talk to you.

38:45.576 --> 38:47.811
Please.

38:47.878 --> 38:49.646
My parents sent me to this

38:49.714 --> 38:51.014
really exclusive all-girls' prep

38:51.082 --> 38:52.182
school. The rich kids would

38:52.249 --> 38:53.216
always dress like they were

38:53.284 --> 38:55.318
poor. Slummin' it.

38:55.386 --> 38:57.053
It was fun for them you know?

38:57.120 --> 38:59.688
Cool to reject the values you'd

38:59.756 --> 39:01.023
grown up with.

39:01.090 --> 39:02.023
Are you coming to a point

39:02.091 --> 39:03.057
any time soon?

39:03.125 --> 39:04.025
When you have money,

39:04.093 --> 39:06.327
it's easy to romanticize not

39:06.395 --> 39:08.163
having any.

39:08.230 --> 39:09.764
And when you're beautiful,

39:09.832 --> 39:11.766
well, it's easy wanting to give

39:11.834 --> 39:13.735
that up, too.

39:13.802 --> 39:17.371
The romance of ugliness...

39:17.439 --> 39:19.740
All I wanted was to know that

39:19.808 --> 39:22.076
when someone looked at me,

39:22.143 --> 39:24.278
they were actually seeing me.

39:24.345 --> 39:27.648
Not some image they could place

39:27.715 --> 39:29.649
on their mantelpiece or show off

39:29.717 --> 39:31.651
to their friends or brag

39:31.719 --> 39:33.820
about having screwed.

39:35.923 --> 39:38.691
You need to get help, Willow.

39:38.758 --> 39:41.060
Serious help. I told you that,

39:41.127 --> 39:42.327
I'm not the one you should be

39:42.395 --> 39:43.295
coming to.

39:43.362 --> 39:44.696
But you understand me.

39:44.764 --> 39:47.532
You're just like me!

39:47.600 --> 39:49.300
Bullshit! I'm not trying

39:49.368 --> 39:51.169
to carve up my face or endanger

39:51.236 --> 39:52.503
other people.

39:52.571 --> 39:53.171
Then why were you

39:53.238 --> 39:54.372
with me, huh?

39:55.307 --> 39:56.207
You wanted to destroy

39:56.275 --> 39:57.342
yourself, too. In your own

39:57.409 --> 39:59.110
little passive aggressive way.

39:59.178 --> 40:00.445
'Cause you're pissed.

40:00.513 --> 40:02.313
You know that all the success

40:02.381 --> 40:04.382
you've ever had wasn't because

40:04.450 --> 40:07.986
of what you did or who you were.

40:08.053 --> 40:09.954
It's always been about

40:10.022 --> 40:12.857
the way you look.

40:12.925 --> 40:15.760
Just make me beautiful again.

40:15.828 --> 40:18.262
Fix me.

40:18.330 --> 40:19.796
Give it back to me.

40:19.864 --> 40:22.265
I... I can't live

40:22.333 --> 40:24.400
looking like this.

40:24.468 --> 40:26.935
No. You need to listen to me.

40:27.003 --> 40:30.738
There's no doctor alive

40:30.806 --> 40:32.139
who can make you beautiful

40:32.207 --> 40:33.774
again.

40:55.502 --> 40:57.102
Where's my treadmill?

40:57.170 --> 40:58.604
I had it moved to the Malibu

40:58.671 --> 41:00.973
house. Your apartment's too

41:01.040 --> 41:02.808
small for it.

41:02.875 --> 41:04.609
And I was hoping Christian

41:04.677 --> 41:06.477
might take a hint.

41:11.716 --> 41:13.350
Oh.

41:13.418 --> 41:14.951
I gotta get going.

41:15.018 --> 41:16.784
No, no, no, hey,

41:16.852 --> 41:18.051
just go back to sleep. Come on.

41:18.119 --> 41:20.586
Oh. Christian's going

41:20.654 --> 41:22.087
to start to worry.

41:22.155 --> 41:23.455
No, he won't.

41:23.522 --> 41:25.256
Just a few more minutes.

41:25.323 --> 41:27.723
Ok.

41:27.790 --> 41:29.290
Will you wake me up in

41:29.358 --> 41:31.258
15 minutes?

41:31.325 --> 41:33.326
Promise me you're not going to

41:33.394 --> 41:35.195
fall asleep.

41:35.262 --> 41:38.331
Don't worry, I'm wide awake.
