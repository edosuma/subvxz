You lost, Miller? Huh?

01:26.819 --> 01:28.385
You deaf, too?
Trailer park's that way.

01:28.387 --> 01:29.386
Yeah, keep chirping, bud.

01:29.388 --> 01:30.320
What, you didn't think
we'd hear that shit, man?

01:30.322 --> 01:31.788
- Yeah, I didn't say anything.
- Bullshit.

01:31.790 --> 01:32.856
What you going
to do about it?

01:32.858 --> 01:33.924
Shut your mouth.

01:33.926 --> 01:34.892
Like your dad
shuts his mouth?

01:34.894 --> 01:36.392
What did you just say?

01:36.394 --> 01:37.561
Say that again.

01:37.563 --> 01:39.195
Around all that prison dick.

02:15.901 --> 02:16.699
Yo, yo, yo...

02:16.701 --> 02:17.900
Get the fuck
out of here, Tyler!

02:17.902 --> 02:19.137
Run, man!

02:20.639 --> 02:21.939
Are you serious, Miller?

02:21.941 --> 02:23.774
You pull this today?

02:23.776 --> 02:24.977
Face on the ground!

02:29.348 --> 02:31.280
Okay! Easy!

02:31.282 --> 02:32.916
I'm not fighting you back!

02:32.918 --> 02:35.720
You Millers think
you can do whatever you want.

04:16.855 --> 04:18.954
Al! Al!

04:18.956 --> 04:20.557
Come have a drink
with us.

04:20.559 --> 04:21.524
Can't today, Len.

04:21.526 --> 04:23.694
Come on.
One drink.

04:23.696 --> 04:25.562
- I have dinner with Brandon.
- So what? Bring him.

04:25.564 --> 04:27.764
'Bout time the little shit
learned how to drink, anyway.

04:27.766 --> 04:29.365
He's 17, Len.
Doesn't need much teaching.

04:29.367 --> 04:30.567
All the better.

04:30.569 --> 04:31.668
Let's sneak him in.

04:31.670 --> 04:33.536
Yeah, I would,
but, um...

04:33.538 --> 04:36.005
it's been a year today, so...

04:36.007 --> 04:37.707
Yeah.

04:37.709 --> 04:38.977
Right, of course.

04:40.112 --> 04:42.478
Hey, listen, uh...

04:42.480 --> 04:44.050
Lindy really wants you guys
to stop over.

04:44.949 --> 04:47.117
We got one of them
new entertainment units.

04:47.119 --> 04:48.918
We got Oilers games,
stuff like that.

04:48.920 --> 04:50.954
I mean, it'd be good
to just sit down and talk,

04:50.956 --> 04:52.055
you know?

04:52.057 --> 04:52.856
Yeah.

04:52.858 --> 04:54.890
I mean, it's going to be
summer time,

04:54.892 --> 04:56.360
and you'll be gone,

04:56.362 --> 04:57.830
and we won't see you.

04:58.596 --> 05:00.796
Another time, for sure.

05:00.798 --> 05:02.765
Hey, listen, you know,
if, uh...

05:02.767 --> 05:04.767
it doesn't have
to be everybody neither.

05:04.769 --> 05:06.570
If you just want somebody
to talk to...

05:06.572 --> 05:07.773
you know?

05:33.732 --> 05:34.964
Hey, how 'bout today?

05:34.966 --> 05:36.565
Why don't you work
on getting jobs,

05:36.567 --> 05:38.637
you little shits?

05:44.041 --> 05:45.709
Hockey player
shoots a grizzly,

05:45.711 --> 05:47.711
and the whole damn country
gets their panties in a bunch.

05:47.713 --> 05:49.114
Fucking libs, eh?

05:52.550 --> 05:53.750
Let the boys play the game,
you know.

05:53.752 --> 05:54.718
This too.

05:54.720 --> 05:55.988
Yeah.

06:06.632 --> 06:08.531
<i>Today marks
the one-year anniversary</i>

06:08.533 --> 06:10.666
<i>of a tragedy here in Castlegar.</i>

06:10.668 --> 06:14.036
<i>Eli Balkoff, a prominent youth
within the local community,</i>

06:14.038 --> 06:16.973
<i>was struck and killed
in a traffic incident last year.</i>

06:16.975 --> 06:19.709
<i>It was at this gas station
where the incident occurred.</i>

06:19.711 --> 06:21.911
<i>An intoxicated local man
robbed the store</i>

06:21.913 --> 06:23.712
<i>and fled in his truck,</i>

06:23.714 --> 06:25.182
<i>where only a few metres
down the road,</i>

06:25.184 --> 06:28.151
<i>a 15-year-old Eli
was riding his bicycle home.</i>

06:28.153 --> 06:30.786
<i>Now Eli's parents,
owners of the local pulp mill,</i>

06:30.788 --> 06:32.221
<i>Helen and Jim Balkoff,</i>

06:32.223 --> 06:35.024
<i>are turning this tragedy
into something good.</i>

06:35.026 --> 06:37.827
<i>My son was
a public servant in the making.</i>

06:37.829 --> 06:42.098
<i>My husband and I would like
to continue that legacy,</i>

06:42.100 --> 06:44.601
<i>and we're very proud
to begin construction</i>

06:44.603 --> 06:48.471
<i>on the Eli Balkoff
Centre for Youth</i>

06:48.473 --> 06:50.973
<i>to help misguided youths
find their way.</i>

06:50.975 --> 06:52.675
<i>Keith Miller,</i>

06:52.677 --> 06:54.711
<i>the driver of the truck
that struck and killed Eli,</i>

06:54.713 --> 06:56.178
<i>was known to police</i>

06:56.180 --> 06:58.248
<i>and had been released on bail
earlier that year</i>

06:58.250 --> 06:59.783
<i>for previous
drug-related offenses.</i>

06:59.785 --> 07:01.117
<i>Miller was sentenced
to 15 years and six months</i>

07:01.119 --> 07:02.354
<i>in prison.</i>

07:13.764 --> 07:15.134
Brand?

07:22.975 --> 07:24.039
<i>You have one message.</i>

07:25.076 --> 07:27.510
<i>Al, it's Darryl.</i>

07:27.512 --> 07:29.280
<i>We need you down here again.</i>

07:39.024 --> 07:40.191
Come on, let's go.

07:41.692 --> 07:43.058
You need to get
a cell phone.

07:43.060 --> 07:44.060
Sorry, Darryl.

07:44.062 --> 07:45.762
Just got your message.

07:45.764 --> 07:46.762
Thanks for coming in.

07:46.764 --> 07:48.231
What'd he do
this time?

07:48.233 --> 07:49.699
Oh, you know,
another scrap.

07:49.701 --> 07:50.767
Took some doing,

07:50.769 --> 07:52.071
but the other kid's not
going to press charges.

07:52.838 --> 07:53.870
Al...

07:53.872 --> 07:55.272
I can't keep doing this.

07:55.274 --> 07:56.940
I know.

07:56.942 --> 07:57.908
Thank you.

07:57.910 --> 07:59.845
Saves us
a lot of paperwork anyway.

08:00.812 --> 08:02.312
Got enough of that
with your name on it already,

08:02.314 --> 08:03.680
don't we, Brandon?

08:03.682 --> 08:05.214
Can I go?

08:05.216 --> 08:06.649
- Yeah, you can go.
- All right.

08:06.651 --> 08:07.718
You know,
one of these days,

08:07.720 --> 08:08.752
you're going to do some
real damage to someone,

08:08.754 --> 08:09.989
smart ass.

08:11.023 --> 08:12.923
You'll have bigger problems
than just paperwork,

08:12.925 --> 08:13.856
I can guarantee that.

08:13.858 --> 08:16.026
- Can you?
- Yeah, keep it up.

08:16.028 --> 08:18.263
You'll be sharing a cell
with your old man in no time.

08:20.264 --> 08:21.731
Fucking asshole, man.

08:21.733 --> 08:23.800
Talking shit.

08:23.802 --> 08:24.968
Stop it.

08:30.274 --> 08:31.675
Why you got
to be such a shit?

08:31.677 --> 08:33.174
- Fuck those guys.
- Fuck those guys?

08:33.177 --> 08:34.309
Fuck those guys.

08:34.312 --> 08:35.544
- Those guys let you walk.
- They didn't let me do shit.

08:35.547 --> 08:38.113
They didn't let you do shit?
Then how you out here with me?

08:38.115 --> 08:39.181
Huh?

08:39.183 --> 08:40.385
Just open the door.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.324
Dad made the front page.
You want to be next?

08:46.658 --> 08:47.927
You're right on track.

08:54.633 --> 08:56.235
Fuck.

09:01.907 --> 09:03.172
Oh, wow.

09:03.174 --> 09:04.708
You get a key cut?

09:04.710 --> 09:07.109
We just heard
about Brandon, so...

09:07.111 --> 09:08.210
Hi.

09:08.212 --> 09:10.146
Hey.

09:10.148 --> 09:11.147
- You good?
- Yeah, you okay?

09:11.149 --> 09:12.383
Oh, yeah.

09:35.340 --> 09:37.009
I didn't know
what day it was.

09:40.278 --> 09:42.414
You knew we had dinner.

09:43.315 --> 09:45.147
Look, why don't
we just visit him?

09:45.149 --> 09:46.651
I mean, he's in jail.
He's not dead.

10:10.375 --> 10:11.577
He had it coming, Ali.

10:13.845 --> 10:14.877
He's a fucking goof.

10:14.879 --> 10:16.614
He was talking shit about Dad.

10:18.149 --> 10:20.182
God, you sound
so much like Dad right now.

10:20.184 --> 10:21.718
Don't say that shit.

10:21.720 --> 10:22.954
You do.

10:24.956 --> 10:26.190
Come on.

10:26.991 --> 10:28.326
I'm nothing like him.

10:30.895 --> 10:33.031
I stick up for my family,
for my friends.

10:35.232 --> 10:36.434
I did the right thing.

10:37.836 --> 10:39.069
If you did the right thing,

10:39.071 --> 10:40.903
then I wouldn't be picking you
up from the police station.

10:40.905 --> 10:43.205
Oh, fucking shit, man,
I can't stand this.

10:43.207 --> 10:45.275
If some guy is standing there,
fucking with us,

10:45.277 --> 10:46.342
you just want me to do nothing?

10:46.344 --> 10:47.542
I'm just going to sit there

10:47.544 --> 10:49.212
and let somebody sit there
and chirp at me, chirp at me?

10:49.214 --> 10:51.013
Like, I fucking reacted.

10:51.015 --> 10:52.250
Who loves you?

10:53.451 --> 10:55.050
Eh?

10:55.052 --> 10:56.487
I do...

10:57.788 --> 10:59.289
but I don't know
what to do anymore,

10:59.291 --> 11:00.757
'cause we keep having
this conversation

11:00.759 --> 11:02.959
over and over.

11:02.961 --> 11:05.361
What, do I have to sit you down
and lay some ground rules?

11:05.363 --> 11:06.999
No, come on.

11:08.365 --> 11:10.135
Ali, nobody asked you
to be the parent.

11:11.369 --> 11:13.469
Who's it going to be, then?

11:13.471 --> 11:16.040
It's me and you, remember?

11:17.842 --> 11:19.545
Four months until you're 18...

11:20.378 --> 11:21.978
and what does that mean?

11:21.980 --> 11:24.049
That Darryl
can't help you anymore.

11:24.816 --> 11:25.848
That means...

11:25.850 --> 11:27.282
that means real jail.

11:27.284 --> 11:29.084
What the fuck do you care
if I go to jail?

11:29.086 --> 11:30.786
The fuck I care?

11:30.788 --> 11:32.122
You're fucking
leaving, remember?

11:32.124 --> 11:33.956
- You're leaving.
- That's not set in stone.

11:33.958 --> 11:34.991
That's set in stone!

11:34.993 --> 11:36.126
It's set in stone

11:36.128 --> 11:37.893
because the minute I turn 18,

11:37.895 --> 11:39.128
I don't need a guardian anymore,

11:39.130 --> 11:40.396
so you can be free
to take off,

11:40.398 --> 11:41.129
do whatever you want!

11:41.131 --> 11:43.199
Even if I do,
even if I do,

11:43.201 --> 11:44.467
that doesn't mean
you're kicked to the curb.

11:44.469 --> 11:46.169
I've been saving up money
for the two of us.

11:46.171 --> 11:47.903
Bullshit, Ali!
Bullshit!

11:47.905 --> 11:49.171
That's what you're doing!

11:49.173 --> 11:51.075
What am I supposed to do?

11:52.476 --> 11:53.810
You're not making
this easy for me!

11:53.812 --> 11:55.377
All I'm doing
is picking you up

11:55.379 --> 11:57.814
every time you make
a stupid fucking mistake.

11:57.816 --> 12:00.449
I am trying here, Brand.
I'm fucking trying.

12:00.451 --> 12:02.253
What the fuck
do you think I'm doing?

12:17.302 --> 12:19.368
Tyler, where you going?

12:19.370 --> 12:22.004
We're, uh, headed out.

12:22.006 --> 12:23.039
Well...

12:23.041 --> 12:25.074
what about dinner?

12:25.076 --> 12:26.645
Just grab something
with my huge allowance.

12:29.346 --> 12:30.516
Coming home tonight?

12:31.283 --> 12:32.818
I don't fucking know.

13:24.568 --> 13:26.237
Fuck it.

13:37.148 --> 13:38.248
<i>Hello?</i>

13:38.250 --> 13:39.315
Hi.

13:39.317 --> 13:41.319
<i>Hi.</i>

13:42.220 --> 13:44.256
<i>Are you drunk?</i>

13:45.456 --> 13:47.290
Maybe.

13:48.659 --> 13:50.259
<i>Maybe yes.</i>

13:50.261 --> 13:52.094
You want to drunk
with me?

13:52.096 --> 13:53.528
<i>Oh...</i>

13:53.530 --> 13:55.931
<i>hon', you know I can't.</i>

13:55.933 --> 13:58.667
But I'm all... frisky.

13:58.669 --> 14:00.439
<i>Frisky?</i>

14:01.339 --> 14:02.638
<i>Yeah, I like it
when you say that.</i>

14:02.640 --> 14:05.176
Frisky.

14:07.479 --> 14:11.147
<i>After this custody shit
with Sophie's over, okay?</i>

14:11.149 --> 14:13.148
<i>Earl's on my ass
about everything.</i>

14:13.150 --> 14:15.384
Oh, come on, Char.

14:15.386 --> 14:18.054
I need some company.

14:18.056 --> 14:19.825
<i>You know we can't.</i>

14:23.360 --> 14:24.662
Okay.

14:32.537 --> 14:34.173
<i>Ali?</i>

14:37.509 --> 14:39.675
Yeah?

14:39.677 --> 14:41.546
<i>I've got to go.</i>

14:42.980 --> 14:44.616
Sure.

15:58.423 --> 16:00.156
Fuck, whose car is that?

16:00.158 --> 16:01.791
Oh, it's fucking Earl!

16:01.793 --> 16:03.158
He's supposed
to be bowling.

16:03.160 --> 16:04.627
Well, he's not.

16:04.629 --> 16:06.262
- Where the fuck are you?
- Dad...

16:06.264 --> 16:07.329
You piece of shit.

16:07.331 --> 16:09.732
You fucking rape my daughter,
you piece of shit?

16:09.734 --> 16:11.300
I'm her boyfriend,
you fucking idiot.

16:11.302 --> 16:12.737
Hey! Hey!

16:32.657 --> 16:34.523
Hello?

16:34.525 --> 16:35.824
<i>Hey, get some clothes on.</i>

16:35.826 --> 16:37.493
<i>We're coming over.</i>

16:37.495 --> 16:39.127
What time is it?

16:39.129 --> 16:40.729
<i>Al...</i>

16:40.731 --> 16:42.230
<i>Something's happened.
I need you to get up.</i>

16:42.232 --> 16:43.699
Darryl?

16:43.701 --> 16:46.134
<i>Alison!
Get your ass up.</i>

16:46.136 --> 16:47.872
Okay, fuck.

16:48.740 --> 16:50.474
<i>Is Brandon there?</i>

16:52.110 --> 16:53.344
I don't know.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.881
<i>Find out.
We'll be there soon.</i>

17:34.751 --> 17:36.518
Morning, Miller.

17:36.520 --> 17:38.122
- Is Brandon around?
- Nope.

17:39.124 --> 17:39.855
You know
where he might be?

17:39.857 --> 17:41.457
I do not.

17:41.459 --> 17:43.395
Have you spoken to him
at all this morning?

17:45.730 --> 17:46.964
Al?

17:47.632 --> 17:48.867
Can we come in?

18:09.921 --> 18:11.487
So you're sure
you don't know where he is?

18:11.489 --> 18:13.322
I'm sure.

18:13.324 --> 18:14.893
Well...

18:16.260 --> 18:18.594
we talked to Sophie Hinters.

18:18.596 --> 18:20.499
You know Earl Hinters,
Sophie's dad?

18:21.633 --> 18:23.165
I do.

18:23.167 --> 18:24.668
Well, we found him
this morning.

18:25.869 --> 18:27.335
He's dead.

18:27.337 --> 18:28.403
What?

18:28.405 --> 18:30.273
And according to Sophie,

18:30.275 --> 18:32.607
Brandon was involved
in an altercation with Earl

18:32.609 --> 18:33.709
before it happened.

18:33.711 --> 18:35.443
The chief found her
unconscious

18:35.445 --> 18:36.679
when he arrived
at the scene.

18:36.681 --> 18:38.780
Earl's car's missing, too.

18:38.782 --> 18:40.615
You think Brandon did it.

18:40.617 --> 18:42.420
We're just looking
to find him is all.

18:43.421 --> 18:44.620
Was hoping
you'd have an idea.

18:44.622 --> 18:45.755
I don't.

18:45.757 --> 18:47.623
You are his legal guardian,
are you not?

18:47.625 --> 18:48.958
Yeah, he sleeps here.
I feed him.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.492
Whatever else is his business.

18:50.494 --> 18:51.727
Real tight-knit, huh?

18:51.729 --> 18:53.328
If you do hear
from him,

18:53.330 --> 18:54.932
will you let us know?

18:56.834 --> 18:58.069
We just need
some information.

19:00.704 --> 19:02.174
Where is Sophie now?

19:03.240 --> 19:05.476
She moved back in
with Charlene.

19:55.460 --> 19:56.661
Come on.

19:59.998 --> 20:02.501
He wasn't good at much,
but he sure knew how to hit.

20:07.672 --> 20:08.837
What happened?

20:08.839 --> 20:10.641
Earl happened.

20:15.512 --> 20:18.014
He got all liquored up
bowling...

20:18.016 --> 20:20.151
came home early,
caught them mid-fuck.

20:21.986 --> 20:23.318
He just lost it.

20:23.320 --> 20:24.755
He almost took
Sophie's head off.

20:28.826 --> 20:29.991
By the time she woke up,

20:29.993 --> 20:32.062
cops everywhere,
Earl in the kitchen.

20:41.972 --> 20:43.905
I'm so sorry, Char.

20:43.907 --> 20:45.373
Fuck Earl.

20:45.375 --> 20:46.845
I'm just glad
Sophie's okay.

20:55.385 --> 20:58.223
Did she say
if anybody else was there?

21:00.023 --> 21:01.225
Just Brandon.

21:07.798 --> 21:09.864
Hey.

21:09.866 --> 21:10.865
The police
are going to find him,

21:10.867 --> 21:12.971
and then we're going
to figure this out, okay?

21:17.909 --> 21:19.911
Do you think
he could have done it?

21:26.116 --> 21:26.982
I know
it's hard to believe.

21:26.984 --> 21:28.852
It's just not looking good
right now.

21:30.054 --> 21:31.289
I'm just being honest.

21:32.056 --> 21:33.021
All right?

21:33.023 --> 21:34.055
You said the same thing
about your father,

21:34.057 --> 21:35.391
like he wasn't a dealer.

21:35.393 --> 21:36.526
You know you did.

21:36.528 --> 21:38.960
I just think that you should be
prepared this time.

21:38.962 --> 21:40.264
He's not Keith.

21:41.365 --> 21:42.498
He was the only one
there, Ali,

21:42.500 --> 21:44.600
and...

21:44.602 --> 21:46.237
you know how he gets.

21:56.012 --> 21:57.479
Got to get ready
for work.

21:57.481 --> 21:58.847
Don't worry,
I'll be quiet.

21:58.849 --> 22:00.784
Hey, come on...

23:32.977 --> 23:35.013
I'm sorry, Mr. Balkoff.

23:59.569 --> 24:01.138
What are you doing?

24:02.507 --> 24:03.905
Yeah, I can see you're
eating your fucking lunch.

24:03.907 --> 24:05.442
Would you roll
the window down, please?

24:06.943 --> 24:08.146
Roll it down!

24:10.013 --> 24:11.046
This is stupid,
you sitting here, Al.

24:11.048 --> 24:12.248
Could really do
without a lecture today, Len.

24:12.250 --> 24:13.283
You can't sit here
like this.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.783
You've got to do something.
He's your brother.

24:14.785 --> 24:15.683
He can sort himself out.

24:15.685 --> 24:16.751
What?

24:16.753 --> 24:17.753
"He can sort..."

24:17.755 --> 24:18.988
God, I am so sick
of this woe-is-me bullshit.

24:18.990 --> 24:20.256
I told you,

24:20.258 --> 24:22.190
I could do without a lecture
today, Len.

24:22.192 --> 24:24.058
I didn't ask
for your goddamn opinion, okay?

24:24.060 --> 24:25.160
Oh, you didn't ask
for my opinion,

24:25.162 --> 24:26.661
but you're going to get it.

24:26.663 --> 24:28.264
Get out of the car.

24:28.266 --> 24:29.230
Not getting out
of the car.

24:29.232 --> 24:30.367
Get out of the car.

24:30.902 --> 24:32.535
I'm not getting out
of the car, Len.

24:32.537 --> 24:34.269
You think
I won't drag you out?

24:34.271 --> 24:35.603
Get out of the car,
I said!

24:35.605 --> 24:37.175
Come on!
Let go of me!

24:37.942 --> 24:39.542
Look, you think
because your old man's not here

24:39.544 --> 24:40.308
to slap some sense
into you,

24:40.310 --> 24:41.844
that I won't do it?

24:41.846 --> 24:43.178
Huh?

24:43.180 --> 24:44.646
You think
Brandon is a murderer?

24:44.648 --> 24:46.316
Do you? Huh?

24:47.317 --> 24:48.551
I don't know.

24:48.553 --> 24:50.021
No, you don't know.

24:51.122 --> 24:52.153
You don't know.

24:52.155 --> 24:53.357
He was there, Len.

24:54.724 --> 24:55.690
You know how he gets.

24:55.692 --> 24:56.725
Look...

24:56.727 --> 24:58.259
Earl was a shithead, Al,

24:58.261 --> 24:59.761
and a crook.

24:59.763 --> 25:01.095
Maybe he didn't deserve
to get what he got,

25:01.097 --> 25:03.065
but he was on everybody's
list around here,

25:03.067 --> 25:04.501
so you don't know.

25:05.435 --> 25:07.835
How do you think he pays for
that fucking car of his, huh?

25:07.837 --> 25:09.171
Hard work?

25:09.173 --> 25:11.442
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

25:25.021 --> 25:26.523
It's happening again,
isn't it?

25:27.892 --> 25:30.292
Look, Al,

25:30.294 --> 25:32.161
I know your old man's not high
in your books right now.

25:32.163 --> 25:33.161
I get that.

25:33.163 --> 25:34.296
He screwed up.

25:34.298 --> 25:35.797
He ran over Balkoff's kid, Len.

25:35.799 --> 25:37.365
God, Al, would you let me
finish, for God's sakes?

25:37.367 --> 25:39.634
Yes!
He fucked up.

25:39.636 --> 25:40.369
He fucked up
real bad,

25:40.371 --> 25:42.938
but that's on him.

25:42.940 --> 25:44.409
That's not on Brandon.

25:45.910 --> 25:46.909
Look, you've got to...

25:46.911 --> 25:48.710
you've got to pull your head
out of your own shit

25:48.712 --> 25:50.046
and get it together,

25:50.048 --> 25:52.050
because if they find him first,
they're going to string him up.

25:53.384 --> 25:54.618
You know this.

25:57.054 --> 25:58.556
You're all he's got.

26:00.057 --> 26:01.859
I know.

26:03.794 --> 26:05.693
Plus...

26:05.695 --> 26:07.095
there's plenty other people

26:07.097 --> 26:09.067
got that "hating the Millers"
shit down pat already.

26:10.267 --> 26:12.136
There's no need for it.

26:23.913 --> 26:25.680
You're a real
asshole, Len.

26:25.682 --> 26:27.251
I know.

26:28.118 --> 26:29.353
Worst part is,
I'm right.

26:33.391 --> 26:34.626
Thank you.

26:35.992 --> 26:37.661
You got it, kiddo.

27:15.732 --> 27:16.731
How are you?

27:16.733 --> 27:17.732
What's up?

27:17.734 --> 27:19.000
Um...

27:19.002 --> 27:20.102
were you working
last night?

27:20.104 --> 27:21.703
Why?

27:21.705 --> 27:23.805
Just looking to get
some information.

27:23.807 --> 27:25.007
About what?

27:25.009 --> 27:26.007
A regular...

27:26.009 --> 27:27.645
called Earl.

27:31.248 --> 27:32.951
The guy
who died last night.

27:33.750 --> 27:35.352
He was here,
right?

27:36.987 --> 27:37.818
Well, uh...

27:37.820 --> 27:40.724
somebody said
that he left early.

27:41.759 --> 27:42.658
Do you know why?

27:42.660 --> 27:44.293
Heard he got a phone call
from someone.

27:44.295 --> 27:46.428
Phone call from who?

27:46.430 --> 27:47.665
I don't know.

27:48.965 --> 27:52.267
Well, maybe the person
working last night would know.

27:52.269 --> 27:55.336
Do you have a staff
list or something?

27:55.338 --> 27:57.072
Look, I don't even know
who you are.

27:57.074 --> 27:59.242
I can't just give you
information on the staff.

28:00.076 --> 28:01.346
Oh, shit.

28:27.938 --> 28:28.937
Okay.

28:28.939 --> 28:30.805
Wednesday...

28:30.807 --> 28:32.240
2:00 to 10:00.

28:32.242 --> 28:33.677
Freya.

28:40.518 --> 28:42.686
Which one of you
are Freya?

28:53.163 --> 28:54.263
<i>Yeah</i> ?

28:54.265 --> 28:56.131
Uh, yeah, hi,
is Freya there?

28:56.133 --> 28:57.865
<i>She just left.</i>

28:57.867 --> 28:59.101
Left where?

28:59.103 --> 29:00.936
<i>The game, obviously.</i>

29:00.938 --> 29:03.971
<i>Everyone's going,
except me.</i>

29:05.041 --> 29:05.908
<i>Who is this?</i>

29:05.910 --> 29:08.346
Uh... it's okay.

30:05.435 --> 30:06.670
Freya?

30:07.904 --> 30:09.173
Yeah?

30:10.039 --> 30:11.472
Can I talk to you
for a sec?

30:11.474 --> 30:13.609
You're Miller's
sister, right?

30:13.611 --> 30:14.642
Who?

30:14.644 --> 30:16.547
Miller's sister...
the dyke.

30:17.347 --> 30:18.346
Can I just talk to you?

30:18.348 --> 30:20.515
Hey, don't touch her.

30:20.517 --> 30:22.084
There a problem here, Freya?

30:22.086 --> 30:23.651
There's no problem.

30:23.653 --> 30:25.453
I wasn't fucking talking
to you.

30:25.455 --> 30:26.921
It's fine, D.

30:26.923 --> 30:28.592
Can you just fucking
talk already?

30:29.425 --> 30:30.660
Okay.

30:31.929 --> 30:34.028
Were you working
at the bowling alley last night?

30:34.030 --> 30:35.500
Yeah.

30:36.532 --> 30:38.368
I'm just looking
for some information.

30:39.369 --> 30:40.334
Do you know who called Earl?

30:40.336 --> 30:41.236
Why you want to know?

30:41.238 --> 30:42.536
I'm just curious.

30:42.538 --> 30:43.971
Is this about your brother?

30:43.973 --> 30:45.340
I'm not talking to you, okay?

30:45.342 --> 30:46.941
I don't know
who called, okay?

30:46.943 --> 30:49.713
I told the cops
the same thing.

30:50.547 --> 30:52.948
I mean,
some guy just called him,

30:52.950 --> 30:55.486
and then dude lost his shit
and ran out the building.

30:57.121 --> 30:58.823
You sure you don't know
who it was?

30:59.957 --> 31:01.390
Any ideas at all?

31:01.392 --> 31:02.926
She's sure.

31:04.394 --> 31:05.663
I'm sure.

31:09.232 --> 31:10.734
Okay.

31:25.950 --> 31:27.285
Hey, Al.

31:29.053 --> 31:30.952
Al... Hey.

31:30.954 --> 31:32.720
Hold this for a second.

31:32.722 --> 31:33.957
Alison, wait up.

31:39.262 --> 31:40.497
Alison, wait up.

31:42.098 --> 31:43.565
Al, I'm on call, come on.

31:43.567 --> 31:45.132
What do you want,
Darryl?

31:45.134 --> 31:46.468
Hey, would you just stop
for a second?

31:46.470 --> 31:48.439
What do you want?

31:49.405 --> 31:51.539
I know it sounds
like I think Brandon did this,

31:51.541 --> 31:53.542
but I'm just following
what we have to go on here.

31:53.544 --> 31:55.376
Yeah, and his history wouldn't
have anything to do with it,

31:55.378 --> 31:56.579
would it?

31:57.681 --> 31:59.613
I can't deny
it isn't a consideration, Al,

31:59.615 --> 32:01.219
but it's not the only one.

32:02.152 --> 32:03.317
Look...

32:04.421 --> 32:05.988
I shouldn't even be
telling you this,

32:05.990 --> 32:06.824
obviously...

32:08.659 --> 32:10.661
but there may have been
someone else there last night...

32:11.694 --> 32:13.296
at Earl's.

32:15.132 --> 32:17.835
We found footprints
at Earl's front window.

32:18.469 --> 32:20.238
Do you have any idea
who it was?

32:21.337 --> 32:22.437
I was hoping
you might know.

32:22.439 --> 32:24.139
Look, when he left,

32:24.141 --> 32:25.710
he was with Sophie
and his friend, Tyler.

32:26.743 --> 32:29.443
After that, I don't know.

32:29.445 --> 32:31.046
Tyler?

32:31.048 --> 32:32.817
Okay, yeah,
I'll see if I can talk to him.

32:35.719 --> 32:36.584
Oh, shit.
Come here.

32:36.586 --> 32:37.486
What?

32:37.488 --> 32:39.257
- Just come on.
- What's wrong with you?

32:40.257 --> 32:41.256
What are you doing?

32:41.258 --> 32:42.324
It's the chief.

32:42.326 --> 32:43.927
He hasn't stopped
since he found Earl.

32:45.028 --> 32:47.062
I really don't need him
seeing us talking.

32:47.064 --> 32:49.267
Look, hey...

32:50.200 --> 32:51.432
Brandon's fingerprints
were found

32:51.434 --> 32:53.303
on what we think
is the murder weapon...

32:54.505 --> 32:55.336
Blunt force to the temple

32:55.338 --> 32:56.537
with the base
of a bowling trophy.

32:56.539 --> 32:58.239
Listen, Sophie said

32:58.241 --> 33:00.042
Earl burst in
and attacked Brandon,

33:00.044 --> 33:01.509
but we need a witness
to back that up,

33:01.511 --> 33:02.811
so if you can think
of anybody else,

33:02.813 --> 33:04.312
just tell me...

33:04.314 --> 33:05.113
because it could mean
the difference

33:05.115 --> 33:07.350
between murder
and self-defense.

33:08.451 --> 33:11.085
Look, obviously
I didn't tell you any of this.

33:11.087 --> 33:12.421
If you hear anything
from Tyler,

33:12.423 --> 33:14.155
just... call me.

33:14.157 --> 33:15.425
Hey.

33:18.327 --> 33:19.594
Thank you.

33:19.596 --> 33:21.065
Yeah.

36:32.021 --> 36:34.021
Haven't heard from you all day.
Where were you?

36:34.023 --> 36:35.792
I'm here now.

36:39.896 --> 36:41.699
Did you just disappear?

36:42.632 --> 36:44.167
I'm sorry.

36:45.369 --> 36:46.800
Is Sophie here?

36:46.802 --> 36:48.004
Yeah, she crashed early.

36:49.039 --> 36:50.005
Where were you?

36:50.007 --> 36:51.274
Um...

36:53.909 --> 36:55.008
I found out

36:55.010 --> 36:57.013
that someone else might have
been there last night.

37:00.449 --> 37:01.516
God...

37:01.518 --> 37:03.620
how do you smoke cloves?

37:06.523 --> 37:07.725
What are you doing?

37:08.492 --> 37:09.557
What do you mean?

37:09.559 --> 37:10.728
What, you're
a detective now?

37:12.896 --> 37:14.865
No, I'm just...

37:22.306 --> 37:23.838
it's just...

37:23.840 --> 37:24.805
want to figure some things out.

37:24.807 --> 37:26.042
Like what?

37:27.010 --> 37:28.943
You're not a cop, Ali.

37:28.945 --> 37:29.978
You're just going
to get in the way.

37:29.980 --> 37:31.915
I'm worried Brandon's
going to take the fall.

37:34.418 --> 37:35.685
And if he did it?

37:36.487 --> 37:39.223
Then he turns himself in
before anyone else gets hurt.

37:39.655 --> 37:41.690
I've just got to find him.

37:41.692 --> 37:43.724
Yeah, how you going to do that?
You going to make flyers?

37:43.726 --> 37:44.825
Don't be like that.

37:44.827 --> 37:46.494
No, I am serious.

37:46.496 --> 37:48.063
I don't want to see you
get into something

37:48.065 --> 37:49.232
you can't back away from.

37:50.967 --> 37:52.766
Do you know something?

37:52.768 --> 37:55.036
I know your family's
not very popular right now.

37:55.038 --> 37:56.570
When have we ever been popular?

37:56.572 --> 37:57.805
This is
serious shit, Al.

37:57.807 --> 37:59.673
Earl was murdered,
all right?

37:59.675 --> 38:01.775
If this was Sophie,
you'd be doing the same thing,

38:01.777 --> 38:03.146
and you know that.

38:03.813 --> 38:05.615
You would.

38:12.021 --> 38:13.256
I'm sorry.

38:14.623 --> 38:15.757
Okay? I'm worried
about you.

38:15.759 --> 38:17.691
You don't have to be worried
about me.

38:17.693 --> 38:18.928
I'll be fine.

38:19.628 --> 38:20.862
Hey.

38:20.864 --> 38:22.530
Don't go.
Come on.

38:22.532 --> 38:23.664
You just got here.

38:23.666 --> 38:24.465
It's fine...

38:24.467 --> 38:27.135
but I can't stop
thinking about this,

38:27.137 --> 38:29.239
so I wouldn't be good
here tonight.

38:30.373 --> 38:31.905
Look, just tell Sophie

38:31.907 --> 38:33.907
that I'd really like
to talk to her at some point.

38:33.909 --> 38:35.677
I will, I will.
Just come inside.

38:35.679 --> 38:36.946
I've got to go.

38:52.429 --> 38:53.330
Evening.

38:54.398 --> 38:55.563
You can't just walk in here.

38:55.565 --> 38:57.132
Oh, you're
one to talk.

38:57.134 --> 38:59.066
Were you just at
Earl's trailer?

38:59.068 --> 38:59.967
Why are you
asking me that?

38:59.969 --> 39:01.838
Well, that's the wrong answer,
isn't it?

39:03.005 --> 39:04.037
Someone saw you, Al.

39:04.039 --> 39:05.876
What were you doing?

39:06.777 --> 39:07.708
I just wanted to see it.

39:07.710 --> 39:08.510
See what?

39:08.512 --> 39:09.844
I just wanted
to see it for myself,

39:09.846 --> 39:11.045
understand it.

39:11.047 --> 39:12.383
And what did you find out?

39:27.097 --> 39:28.128
What is it?

39:28.130 --> 39:29.130
I don't know.

39:29.132 --> 39:30.831
Don't lie to me.

39:30.833 --> 39:32.101
I'm not lying to you.

39:37.974 --> 39:38.940
All this trouble...

39:38.942 --> 39:40.444
for an art project.

39:41.911 --> 39:43.545
You don't think
that looks a little suspicious,

39:43.547 --> 39:45.079
like maybe you're trying to
hide something else from us?

39:45.081 --> 39:47.048
I'm not trying to hide
anything from you.

39:47.050 --> 39:48.782
Well, being as you just went
through a crime scene,

39:48.784 --> 39:51.187
I'm having a tough time
believing you.

39:51.987 --> 39:53.356
Darryl, check
the house please.

39:55.759 --> 39:57.294
Yup.

40:08.572 --> 40:10.140
I knew your mom,
you know.

40:12.509 --> 40:14.711
She was a screw-up, too.

40:16.179 --> 40:18.881
Fruit doesn't fall that far,
does it?

40:19.583 --> 40:20.682
Not as bad
as your dad,

40:20.684 --> 40:22.019
mind you.

40:23.253 --> 40:25.723
It's no wonder
she left.

40:26.789 --> 40:28.425
It's all clear, Chief.

40:34.563 --> 40:35.832
So...

40:36.900 --> 40:38.633
we just built some trust,
Miller.

40:38.635 --> 40:40.834
That's how
that works.

40:40.836 --> 40:42.506
You tell me
the truth...

40:43.539 --> 40:44.742
I believe you.

40:46.175 --> 40:47.775
Don't let us find you
messing around again

40:47.777 --> 40:49.479
in places
you shouldn't.

40:50.679 --> 40:52.579
The next time you need
to see something for yourself,

40:52.581 --> 40:54.648
don't.

40:54.650 --> 40:56.185
Understand
each other?

40:57.019 --> 40:58.287
Yes.

41:00.556 --> 41:01.791
Darryl.

41:32.655 --> 41:33.823
Hey.

41:34.858 --> 41:37.124
I, uh...

41:37.126 --> 41:39.229
saw that your mom's car
wasn't out there.

41:40.297 --> 41:42.963
Yeah, I think
she left somewhere this morning.

41:42.965 --> 41:44.632
That's cool,

41:44.634 --> 41:46.066
'cause I actually...

41:47.202 --> 41:49.006
wanted to talk to you.

41:50.172 --> 41:51.838
Anything on Brandon?

41:51.840 --> 41:53.075
No...

41:54.143 --> 41:56.144
Um...

41:56.146 --> 41:58.348
but I went to the trailer park
last night.

41:59.215 --> 42:00.748
You went there?

42:00.750 --> 42:02.084
Yeah.

42:03.152 --> 42:04.387
I found this.

42:05.956 --> 42:07.424
Does that mean
anything to you?

42:09.659 --> 42:10.925
Can you think
of anything?

42:10.927 --> 42:11.892
Yeah, Leland wears there.

42:11.894 --> 42:13.094
Leland?

42:13.096 --> 42:14.531
He's punk.

42:16.132 --> 42:18.035
Do you know
why he would have been there?

42:18.969 --> 42:22.171
He's the guy that Brandon
beat the shit out of.

42:26.108 --> 42:27.374
Know where I might find him?

42:27.376 --> 42:29.876
Tyler's girlfriend,
Freya, might know.

42:29.878 --> 42:32.115
Her and Leland
used to date.

42:41.791 --> 42:44.528
Oh, my god
You have got to be kidding me.

42:54.670 --> 42:55.872
What are you doing here?

42:57.773 --> 42:59.941
I'm showing support
for Charlene and Sophie.

43:00.811 --> 43:03.144
And you think
that's appropriate, huh?

43:03.146 --> 43:05.112
How dare you
show your face

43:05.114 --> 43:06.246
after what your
brother did.

43:06.248 --> 43:08.215
He's missing, Helen.

43:08.217 --> 43:09.282
He's not guilty.

43:09.284 --> 43:10.920
It's Ms. Balkoff to you.

43:14.257 --> 43:15.789
I'm so sorry about Eli.

43:15.791 --> 43:18.060
Don't you talk about him.

43:19.061 --> 43:20.530
Leave my son
out of this.

43:22.965 --> 43:24.934
We're here
to show true support...

43:26.402 --> 43:28.938
from those who know
what it's like to lose someone.

43:30.440 --> 43:32.475
Support
that counts for something.

43:36.880 --> 43:38.315
Come on, girls.

44:24.159 --> 44:25.860
What's up, slit?

44:25.862 --> 44:27.095
What the fuck
are you doing here?

44:27.097 --> 44:28.295
You even allowed
to be here?

44:28.297 --> 44:29.863
I did go here once.

44:29.865 --> 44:30.898
Yeah, but you don't
anymore.

44:30.900 --> 44:31.833
No, I don't.

44:31.835 --> 44:33.867
That's very astute.

44:33.869 --> 44:35.037
What's up?

44:36.840 --> 44:38.275
Can we talk?

44:46.916 --> 44:49.152
Come talk to my dick
when you're done!

44:52.956 --> 44:54.454
Where'd you get that from?

44:54.456 --> 44:56.592
I found it
at Earl's trailer.

45:00.063 --> 45:01.262
Look, I don't want
any trouble.

45:01.264 --> 45:03.396
I'm not the cops,
Freya...

45:03.398 --> 45:06.002
but I could talk to them.

45:07.536 --> 45:08.635
So let's try
this again.

45:08.637 --> 45:12.441
Do you know who called Earl
at the bowling alley?

45:21.416 --> 45:23.050
Yeah, it was Leland.

45:23.052 --> 45:24.385
You sure?

45:24.387 --> 45:25.485
We dated a while.

45:25.487 --> 45:26.521
But you don't anymore.

45:26.523 --> 45:27.790
No.

45:28.525 --> 45:29.760
With Tyler now.

45:32.996 --> 45:35.031
Why wouldn't you have told
the cops about Leland?

45:36.465 --> 45:38.298
I don't want to be
associated with anything.

45:38.300 --> 45:41.001
I mean,
Leland was a really bad scene,

45:41.003 --> 45:42.970
and...

45:42.972 --> 45:44.871
I got caught with shit
I shouldn't have.

45:44.873 --> 45:47.209
Police are the last thing
I want to deal with right now.

45:49.878 --> 45:51.179
Well, do you know
what he told Earl?

45:51.181 --> 45:52.146
No.

45:52.148 --> 45:55.318
Uh, whatever it was
really pissed him off.

45:56.952 --> 45:58.820
Right.

45:58.822 --> 46:00.387
He live
at the trailer park?

46:00.389 --> 46:01.389
Thrums.

46:01.391 --> 46:02.559
Where at?

46:03.293 --> 46:04.458
Come on,

46:04.460 --> 46:06.994
I'm not going to say that
you told me anything, okay?

46:06.996 --> 46:08.665
I'm not going to say anything
to anybody.

46:23.512 --> 46:25.345
I didn't give you that.

46:25.347 --> 46:27.447
Leland doesn't do visitors.

46:27.449 --> 46:29.318
Why not?

46:30.286 --> 46:31.620
He's a dealer?

46:32.922 --> 46:33.887
Where have you been?

46:33.889 --> 46:35.425
Graduated.

46:38.094 --> 46:39.796
You talk to Tyler?

46:41.931 --> 46:43.366
Oh.

47:53.235 --> 47:54.803
Hello?

47:59.943 --> 48:01.611
Hello?

48:12.956 --> 48:14.191
Oh!

48:25.300 --> 48:26.836
Shit...

49:25.061 --> 49:26.360
Char?

49:36.572 --> 49:39.106
No, no, no, no...

49:39.108 --> 49:40.844
No, no, no, no!

49:58.161 --> 49:59.126
Engine's
still warm.

49:59.128 --> 50:00.126
She can't be far.

50:00.128 --> 50:02.128
Get a perimeter going.

50:02.130 --> 50:03.430
We're not sure
what's happening yet, Chief.

50:03.432 --> 50:04.764
I warned her, Darryl.

50:04.766 --> 50:05.800
Find her, and
bring her in.

50:05.802 --> 50:07.233
Yes, sir.

50:07.235 --> 50:08.704
Chief! You'd better
come look at this.

51:28.150 --> 51:30.019
Who the fuck
do they think they are?

51:38.260 --> 51:39.595
Son of a bitch...

51:41.264 --> 51:42.295
Little pussy,

51:42.297 --> 51:43.229
I'll fucking
smack him in the...

51:43.231 --> 51:44.501
Hey, Len.

51:45.233 --> 51:46.233
Hey, Al.

51:46.235 --> 51:47.233
Hi.

51:47.235 --> 51:48.302
Hey.

51:48.304 --> 51:49.336
Troy cut you off again?

51:49.338 --> 51:50.771
Ah, asshole.

51:50.773 --> 51:51.804
Thinks I'm
a fucking pussy.

51:51.806 --> 51:53.206
I'm no fucking
pussy, Al.

51:53.208 --> 51:54.307
I know.

51:54.309 --> 51:55.376
You're goddamn right
I'm not.

51:55.378 --> 51:58.579
I know.
Hey... Len?

51:58.581 --> 52:00.648
You got some beers
at home?

52:00.650 --> 52:01.951
Yes, I do.

52:02.818 --> 52:04.788
Give me your keys.

52:10.592 --> 52:11.825
You drive.

52:11.827 --> 52:13.863
Yep. Come on.

52:41.791 --> 52:43.026
Char?

53:17.460 --> 53:18.825
We're closed.

53:18.827 --> 53:20.696
Just a question.

53:30.672 --> 53:31.639
What is it?

53:31.641 --> 53:33.740
Do you know
if Charlene was working today?

53:33.742 --> 53:35.144
I know she was supposed to.

53:36.012 --> 53:36.911
She didn't show up?

53:36.913 --> 53:38.814
Nope. Didn't answer
her phone neither.

53:39.581 --> 53:40.816
Okay.

53:45.054 --> 53:46.589
Oh, man...

54:28.396 --> 54:29.796
<i>Hey, this is Charlene.</i>

54:29.798 --> 54:30.963
<i>Can't get to the phone.
Leave a message.</i>

54:39.974 --> 54:41.041
<i>Tarasoff.</i>

54:41.043 --> 54:42.642
It's me.

54:42.644 --> 54:43.876
<i>Hold on.</i>

54:43.878 --> 54:45.080
Darryl?

54:47.449 --> 54:48.981
<i>Al, we're bringing in officers
from Trail and Nelson.</i>

54:48.983 --> 54:50.416
How did you know I was there?

54:51.420 --> 54:52.485
<i>They're talking
about bringing Tactical in</i>

54:52.487 --> 54:53.320
<i>from the coast.</i>

54:53.322 --> 54:55.722
Darryl, how did you know
I was there?

54:55.724 --> 54:56.923
<i>Oh, we didn't.</i>

54:56.925 --> 54:58.159
<i>The Chief got a tip</i>

54:58.161 --> 54:59.793
<i>that Leland may have been
the witness at the trailer park.</i>

54:59.795 --> 55:00.860
Yeah, he was.

55:00.862 --> 55:01.729
He was also the one

55:01.731 --> 55:03.666
that called Earl
at the bowling alley.

55:04.467 --> 55:05.699
<i>How did you know that?</i>

55:05.701 --> 55:07.934
Do you think he was trying
to set up Brandon?

55:07.936 --> 55:09.470
You know, for the fight,
or...?

55:09.472 --> 55:10.537
<i>Hold on, hold on.</i>

55:10.539 --> 55:12.274
<i>Where are you getting
this information from?</i>

55:13.576 --> 55:15.541
<i>Alison, come in, please.</i>

55:15.543 --> 55:17.478
<i>If you share
what information you have,</i>

55:17.480 --> 55:18.679
<i>we can work this out.</i>

55:18.681 --> 55:19.847
Tyler!

55:19.849 --> 55:21.084
<i>Alison?</i>

56:08.664 --> 56:09.932
Ty!

56:12.934 --> 56:14.236
Is he all right at least?

56:15.905 --> 56:17.173
Al?

56:18.072 --> 56:19.072
Why are you
chasing me?

56:19.074 --> 56:20.773
You wouldn't stop!

56:20.775 --> 56:21.874
I was getting chased!

56:21.876 --> 56:23.146
Yeah.

56:23.913 --> 56:25.113
Are you with him?

56:25.880 --> 56:27.014
We're safe.

56:27.016 --> 56:28.548
Stay out of it.

56:28.550 --> 56:31.150
He's my brother.
Give me something.

56:31.152 --> 56:33.186
He doesn't want
you involved...

56:33.188 --> 56:35.488
and hey, leave Freya
out of it, will you?

56:35.490 --> 56:37.426
She's going through
enough shit already.

56:40.862 --> 56:42.097
Shit.

57:12.827 --> 57:14.026
- Hey.
- What?

57:14.028 --> 57:15.829
Where's everybody
partying tonight?

57:15.831 --> 57:17.164
How bad
do you want to know?

57:17.166 --> 57:18.197
Just tell me, 'kay?

57:18.199 --> 57:19.166
How 'bout a case?

57:19.168 --> 57:20.367
Tell me now,

57:20.369 --> 57:21.901
and I'll get you next time.
I'll get you next two times.

57:21.903 --> 57:22.869
How about a case,

57:22.871 --> 57:24.804
and you show us your tits?

57:24.806 --> 57:26.206
How about a handjob
while you're at it?

57:26.208 --> 57:27.273
Fuck off
and tell me.

57:27.275 --> 57:28.510
Get the fuck off me!

57:30.079 --> 57:31.811
Up Snob Hill,
Kristy Peterson's place.

57:31.813 --> 57:34.149
We'd be going, too,
if we had a boot.

57:37.253 --> 57:39.188
Piece of shit kid.

57:46.862 --> 57:48.131
Hey.

57:48.864 --> 57:50.097
Just this.

57:50.099 --> 57:52.099
Don't move.

57:52.101 --> 57:53.900
Police are out looking for you
all over town,

57:53.902 --> 57:55.936
and I got you,
so just don't move.

57:55.938 --> 57:57.003
You don't know
what you're doing.

57:57.005 --> 57:58.273
The hell I don't.

57:59.208 --> 58:00.307
Dave...

58:00.309 --> 58:01.275
you know me.

58:01.277 --> 58:02.742
Yeah, I do,

58:02.744 --> 58:03.744
and you're a Miller.

58:03.746 --> 58:05.778
And I didn't do anything.

58:05.780 --> 58:07.182
Shut your mouth.

58:09.117 --> 58:11.017
Hello?

58:11.019 --> 58:12.952
This is Dave Foster
from Twin River Liquor.

58:12.954 --> 58:14.890
I have Alison Miller here.

58:16.190 --> 58:17.926
It's not even loaded.

58:22.231 --> 58:23.533
Hey!

58:25.800 --> 58:27.035
Len, wake up!

58:29.170 --> 58:31.304
If you're so innocent,
why are you running?

58:31.306 --> 58:32.271
Len? Len!

58:33.175 --> 58:34.377
What the fuck?

58:35.610 --> 58:36.642
Len!

58:37.612 --> 58:38.579
Lenny!

58:38.581 --> 58:40.149
Lenny, you drunk fuck, wake up!

58:42.717 --> 58:43.916
Hey, Dave.

59:11.914 --> 59:13.482
I'm proud of you, Al.

59:16.818 --> 59:18.386
Thanks, Len.

01:00:14.242 --> 01:00:15.342
Hey!

01:00:15.344 --> 01:00:16.979
Why the fuck are you here?

01:00:20.715 --> 01:00:22.017
What the fuck?

01:00:25.721 --> 01:00:26.720
Open the door!

01:00:26.722 --> 01:00:29.121
Tyler was in town today.
What did he tell you?

01:00:29.123 --> 01:00:30.222
Nothing! He...

01:00:30.224 --> 01:00:31.391
He mentioned you by name.

01:00:31.393 --> 01:00:32.425
Just...

01:00:32.427 --> 01:00:33.726
fucking stay out of it!

01:00:33.728 --> 01:00:34.728
I can't stay out of it.

01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:35.762
This is my brother.

01:00:35.764 --> 01:00:37.197
He's in some shit,
and I don't know what it is,

01:00:37.199 --> 01:00:38.764
so can you please just help me?

01:00:38.766 --> 01:00:39.999
Alison...

01:00:40.001 --> 01:00:41.367
I don't know what
to fucking tell you.

01:00:41.369 --> 01:00:42.769
Just tell me where he is!

01:00:44.773 --> 01:00:47.074
Pass Creek, okay?

01:00:47.076 --> 01:00:47.907
Pass Creek,
above the falls.

01:00:47.909 --> 01:00:49.943
They ditched Earl's
car up there.

01:00:49.945 --> 01:00:51.144
Open the fucking door!

01:00:51.146 --> 01:00:52.311
Get out.

01:00:52.313 --> 01:00:53.581
Go!

01:00:56.985 --> 01:00:58.050
Freya, move!

01:00:58.052 --> 01:00:59.952
Dustin! Fuck off!

01:00:59.954 --> 01:01:00.954
What are you doing?

01:01:00.956 --> 01:01:02.289
Fuck, what are you doing?

01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:03.757
Fucking...

01:01:03.759 --> 01:01:05.092
get off of me!

01:01:05.094 --> 01:01:06.126
Where are you going?

01:01:06.128 --> 01:01:07.663
The fuck are you doing?

01:01:14.268 --> 01:01:15.769
Party just got started!

01:01:15.771 --> 01:01:17.436
Let... go of me!

01:01:17.438 --> 01:01:19.005
You like it on your
back, don't you?

01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:21.677
I like it rough, too.

01:01:24.813 --> 01:01:26.045
Ow!

01:01:26.047 --> 01:01:28.083
Fucking piece of shit!

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:02.789
Tyler?

01:06:49.471 --> 01:06:50.772
Brandon?

01:09:57.759 --> 01:09:59.660
You can stay right there!

01:10:09.804 --> 01:10:11.039
Debbie!

01:10:12.039 --> 01:10:14.040
I need your help
out here!

01:10:14.042 --> 01:10:16.545
I found her
in the field.

01:10:18.613 --> 01:10:19.778
What the hell
happened?

01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:20.946
I didn't shoot her.

01:10:20.948 --> 01:10:22.615
Now, just...
just take this.

01:10:22.617 --> 01:10:24.785
Come on. Come on.

01:10:25.953 --> 01:10:26.952
Okay.

01:10:26.954 --> 01:10:29.022
Okay. There.

01:10:33.662 --> 01:10:35.361
Debbie, get the kit.

01:10:35.363 --> 01:10:36.795
God...

01:10:36.797 --> 01:10:38.430
This is Keith's girl.

01:10:38.432 --> 01:10:39.868
The kit!

01:10:42.304 --> 01:10:44.106
Okay. Okay...

01:10:45.873 --> 01:10:47.309
Oh, no...

01:10:51.645 --> 01:10:53.281
Debbie, hurry up!

01:11:18.472 --> 01:11:20.106
Well...

01:11:20.108 --> 01:11:21.907
Police have roadblocks
everywhere.

01:11:21.909 --> 01:11:23.108
What?

01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:24.846
She is in something bad.

01:11:27.614 --> 01:11:30.116
Was there anything
about who shot her?

01:11:30.118 --> 01:11:31.616
Nothing.

01:11:31.618 --> 01:11:33.187
No one's talking anyway.

01:11:34.456 --> 01:11:35.888
Oh, Jesus, Ruth.

01:11:35.890 --> 01:11:37.990
What do we do with her?
We can't keep her here.

01:11:37.992 --> 01:11:39.525
Where else
is she going to go?

01:11:39.527 --> 01:11:41.827
I don't know,
but she can't stay here.

01:11:41.829 --> 01:11:42.995
Who's going
to know she's here?

01:11:42.997 --> 01:11:45.167
I don't know,
and neither do you.

01:11:46.568 --> 01:11:47.900
For Christ sake,

01:11:47.902 --> 01:11:50.172
this ends one way for us
if word gets out.

01:11:53.675 --> 01:11:55.607
Oh, you're awake.

01:11:55.609 --> 01:11:56.843
Uh, good.

01:11:56.845 --> 01:11:57.843
Are you hungry?

01:11:57.845 --> 01:11:59.010
You should be.

01:11:59.012 --> 01:12:00.214
I made some soup.

01:12:01.382 --> 01:12:03.549
How long have I been asleep?

01:12:03.551 --> 01:12:05.852
Since yesterday.

01:12:05.854 --> 01:12:06.887
We didn't think

01:12:06.889 --> 01:12:08.923
that the hospital was
in your best interests.

01:12:10.725 --> 01:12:11.891
How do you two know who I am?

01:12:11.893 --> 01:12:13.492
We knew your mom.

01:12:13.494 --> 01:12:14.760
I don't recognize
the two of you.

01:12:14.762 --> 01:12:15.827
You were just a kid.

01:12:15.829 --> 01:12:17.098
I wouldn't imagine
you would.

01:12:18.533 --> 01:12:21.067
Is that how you know
my dad?

01:12:21.069 --> 01:12:23.005
It's a small town.
Everyone knows Keith.

01:12:26.408 --> 01:12:30.175
Guessing that field out back
has a lot to do with it, too.

01:12:30.177 --> 01:12:31.413
Nothing that concerns you.

01:12:32.947 --> 01:12:34.647
We're, uh,
we're growers.

01:12:34.649 --> 01:12:36.081
That's enough.

01:12:36.083 --> 01:12:37.549
She has a right
to know.

01:12:37.551 --> 01:12:39.387
No, she has no rights at all
in this house.

01:12:40.654 --> 01:12:43.455
Can't afford another
Miller charity case.

01:12:43.457 --> 01:12:45.226
Either that,
or she was dead, Deb.

01:12:46.594 --> 01:12:47.860
Just get rid of her,

01:12:47.862 --> 01:12:49.431
soon as she's able.

01:12:52.801 --> 01:12:55.737
This comes back to us,
I swear to God...

01:13:01.141 --> 01:13:02.141
'Kay.

01:13:02.143 --> 01:13:03.678
Here.

01:13:06.648 --> 01:13:08.984
This have to do with my dad
robbing that gas station?

01:13:12.186 --> 01:13:13.754
Why don't you eat first?

01:13:16.791 --> 01:13:17.993
I won't be staying long.

01:13:28.536 --> 01:13:33.805
Keith owed a lot of money
to a lot of folks,

01:13:33.807 --> 01:13:35.208
and some of those folks
were the kind

01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:37.479
that you wouldn't want
to be owing money to.

01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:41.013
They started threatening him.

01:13:41.015 --> 01:13:42.451
With what?

01:13:43.984 --> 01:13:46.721
With you guys.

01:13:48.957 --> 01:13:50.755
How do you know all this?

01:13:50.757 --> 01:13:53.092
Well, Keith knew
what we... did,

01:13:53.094 --> 01:13:55.126
and so...

01:13:55.128 --> 01:13:56.765
after your mom left...

01:13:58.065 --> 01:14:00.833
we... we put him in touch
with the right people,

01:14:00.835 --> 01:14:03.105
like he wanted.

01:14:05.038 --> 01:14:07.374
We didn't know
he was using, though.

01:14:09.644 --> 01:14:11.413
That came back on us.

01:14:15.115 --> 01:14:17.017
He used to talk
about you kids a lot.

01:14:18.118 --> 01:14:19.085
I'm sure he did.

01:14:19.087 --> 01:14:20.355
He did!

01:14:21.756 --> 01:14:23.258
Showed us pictures, and...

01:14:24.926 --> 01:14:26.762
He was real proud of you.

01:14:32.266 --> 01:14:34.133
I know you don't want
to hear this, Alison,

01:14:34.135 --> 01:14:35.968
but...

01:14:35.970 --> 01:14:38.473
your dad was trying
to protect you that day.

01:14:40.908 --> 01:14:42.607
He dragged that kid
under his truck

01:14:42.609 --> 01:14:44.879
for a full block, screaming.

01:14:47.715 --> 01:14:49.450
I don't care
what he was trying to do.

01:14:51.019 --> 01:14:52.521
He left us alone...

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:55.222
just like Mom.

01:14:56.858 --> 01:14:59.724
A child should never pay
for the sins of the parent,

01:14:59.726 --> 01:15:02.594
but they most
certainly will.

01:15:02.596 --> 01:15:05.565
Eli Balkoff's death
was a tragedy.

01:15:05.567 --> 01:15:06.766
I mean,

01:15:06.768 --> 01:15:09.634
Keith did a lot of bad things.

01:15:09.636 --> 01:15:11.839
You've got a lot of reasons
to hate him...

01:15:13.307 --> 01:15:17.145
but you can't let his past be
who you are now.

01:15:19.613 --> 01:15:22.113
I mean, your mom leaving
the way she did,

01:15:22.115 --> 01:15:24.183
that set him off in a bad way,

01:15:24.185 --> 01:15:25.718
and it wasn't all her fault.

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:27.189
Keith...

01:15:28.256 --> 01:15:30.357
is a hard man
to like...

01:15:32.159 --> 01:15:35.594
but he would do anything
for you,

01:15:35.596 --> 01:15:37.399
anything for his family.

01:15:40.368 --> 01:15:44.973
I think that you are alike
in that way.

01:15:49.377 --> 01:15:51.246
You heard about Brandon?

01:15:55.149 --> 01:15:56.885
I want to help you, Alison.

01:15:59.953 --> 01:16:01.922
I think we owe you that much.

01:16:08.762 --> 01:16:09.762
<i>Hey, this is Charlene.</i>

01:16:09.764 --> 01:16:11.363
<i>I can't get to the phone.
Leave a message.</i>

01:16:11.365 --> 01:16:12.333
Fuck...

01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:23.142
<i>Tarasoff.</i>

01:16:23.144 --> 01:16:24.242
Hey.

01:16:24.244 --> 01:16:25.777
<i>Al? Hey!</i>

01:16:25.779 --> 01:16:27.647
<i>Where are you? Let me...
let me come and get you.</i>

01:16:27.649 --> 01:16:29.648
I found Tyler's body.

01:16:30.717 --> 01:16:31.983
Above Pass Creek.

01:16:31.985 --> 01:16:33.989
Whoever shot him
was still there.

01:16:34.889 --> 01:16:35.955
<i>How do you know?</i>

01:16:35.957 --> 01:16:38.089
Because he shot me, too.

01:16:38.091 --> 01:16:40.326
<i>Jesus, Al.
Are you okay?</i>

01:16:40.328 --> 01:16:42.030
I'm okay.

01:16:43.197 --> 01:16:44.229
<i>Did you see who it was?</i>

01:16:44.231 --> 01:16:47.266
I didn't see who it was.
I just saw their car...

01:16:47.268 --> 01:16:49.337
red muscle car.

01:16:50.971 --> 01:16:53.004
How would they have known
I was up there?

01:16:53.006 --> 01:16:54.242
<i>Well, how did you know?</i>

01:16:56.077 --> 01:16:59.445
I talked to that Freya girl
at Petersons'.

01:16:59.447 --> 01:17:01.080
<i>Chief questioned her.</i>

01:17:01.082 --> 01:17:02.982
<i>She didn't mention anything
about Pass Creek.</i>

01:17:02.984 --> 01:17:05.817
Yeah, she doesn't really like
talking to anybody.

01:17:05.819 --> 01:17:07.852
You found anything on Leland?

01:17:07.854 --> 01:17:09.854
<i>Yeah, uh...</i>

01:17:09.856 --> 01:17:11.322
<i>I confirmed
that Leland called Earl</i>

01:17:11.324 --> 01:17:12.857
<i>at the bowling alley</i>

01:17:12.859 --> 01:17:14.125
<i>and told him
that Sophie was being raped.</i>

01:17:14.127 --> 01:17:15.894
Jesus.

01:17:15.896 --> 01:17:17.463
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:17:17.465 --> 01:17:21.000
<i>Now, it looks like Leland
was staking out the trailer,</i>

01:17:21.002 --> 01:17:23.001
<i>because 14 minutes
after he called Earl,</i>

01:17:23.003 --> 01:17:24.437
<i>he called us,</i>

01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:26.938
<i>from the same payphone
within the trailer park itself.</i>

01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:29.174
<i>He made Earl angry enough
to attack a minor,</i>

01:17:29.176 --> 01:17:31.309
<i>and then he tried
to get him caught red-handed.</i>

01:17:31.311 --> 01:17:33.178
Who would try to set up Earl?

01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:34.780
Earl's a nobody.

01:17:34.782 --> 01:17:36.415
<i>I don't know,</i>

01:17:36.417 --> 01:17:39.418
<i>but whoever it was,
they didn't want him dead.</i>

01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:41.821
<i>They must have had something
to gain from his arrest.</i>

01:17:41.823 --> 01:17:43.258
Someone to gain.

01:17:45.292 --> 01:17:47.026
<i>Where are you going
with this?</i>

01:17:47.028 --> 01:17:48.997
Charlene.

01:17:50.163 --> 01:17:53.432
I found Charlene's cigarettes
at Leland's.

01:17:53.434 --> 01:17:54.767
<i>Charlene Hinters?</i>

01:17:54.769 --> 01:17:56.037
Yeah.

01:17:57.337 --> 01:18:00.371
If Earl gets arrested
for beating up a minor,

01:18:00.373 --> 01:18:03.409
then Charlene gets custody
of Sophie.

01:18:03.411 --> 01:18:05.076
<i>Okay...</i>

01:18:05.078 --> 01:18:08.246
<i>so maybe Charlene
paid Leland to make the calls,</i>

01:18:08.248 --> 01:18:11.685
<i>but if she wanted Earl arrested,
then who killed him?</i>

01:18:14.055 --> 01:18:15.589
<i>Ali?</i>

01:18:16.757 --> 01:18:18.426
<i>Alison, you still there?</i>

01:18:21.828 --> 01:18:22.827
<i>Al?</i>

01:18:22.829 --> 01:18:24.298
Balkoff.

01:18:26.801 --> 01:18:28.770
Keep your phone close.

01:18:37.878 --> 01:18:39.044
He doesn't
need them!

01:18:39.046 --> 01:18:41.415
He doesn't
value that...

01:18:45.185 --> 01:18:47.154
You remember what I said.

01:18:50.257 --> 01:18:51.693
Sorry about her. Um...

01:18:53.426 --> 01:18:55.497
Keith robbed us,
too, that day.

01:18:56.797 --> 01:18:58.263
Not that we could
report it, obviously.

01:18:58.265 --> 01:19:00.100
She's still sore about it.

01:19:00.868 --> 01:19:02.470
I can relate.

01:19:04.838 --> 01:19:06.540
Prove me wrong.

01:19:09.976 --> 01:19:11.678
Can't guarantee
it's going to come back.

01:19:13.547 --> 01:19:15.749
Can't guarantee
we won't report it missing.

01:19:25.926 --> 01:19:27.492
Yeah, hold on, um...

01:19:27.494 --> 01:19:28.730
here.

01:19:29.596 --> 01:19:33.467
It's better to have it
and not need it.

01:19:39.439 --> 01:19:40.675
Thank you.

01:21:16.537 --> 01:21:18.173
Inside.

01:21:31.217 --> 01:21:33.253
Nobody move.

01:21:34.087 --> 01:21:35.489
Where is she?

01:21:36.690 --> 01:21:37.792
Where's Helen?

01:21:39.961 --> 01:21:41.693
I had a thought
about the Marlowe character.

01:21:47.134 --> 01:21:47.965
What are you doing?

01:21:47.967 --> 01:21:49.770
Why do I have a bullet hole
in me?

01:21:51.005 --> 01:21:52.437
I don't know. I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:21:52.439 --> 01:21:55.139
I saw the car, Helen!

01:21:55.141 --> 01:21:56.944
I saw Eli's car.

01:21:58.578 --> 01:21:59.814
I don't have it.

01:22:01.681 --> 01:22:03.348
Who does?

01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:04.282
I can't.
I'm begging you.

01:22:04.284 --> 01:22:05.787
Who?

01:22:08.221 --> 01:22:09.754
Ah!

01:22:09.756 --> 01:22:12.458
It wasn't my idea.

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:13.659
He just did it.

01:22:13.661 --> 01:22:15.393
I didn't have anything
to do with it.

01:22:15.395 --> 01:22:16.661
With what?

01:22:16.663 --> 01:22:17.763
Earl.

01:22:17.765 --> 01:22:19.231
He killed Earl

01:22:19.233 --> 01:22:20.699
and made me give him
Eli's car.

01:22:20.701 --> 01:22:22.201
I didn't have anything to do
with it.

01:22:22.203 --> 01:22:24.570
Who? Who?

01:22:24.572 --> 01:22:25.704
Chief!

01:22:25.706 --> 01:22:26.941
Please...

01:22:28.242 --> 01:22:30.245
It was Chief.

01:22:31.378 --> 01:22:33.312
Chief killed Earl?

01:22:33.314 --> 01:22:34.982
And what do you have
to do with it?

01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:38.150
Hmm?

01:22:38.152 --> 01:22:39.418
We...

01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:41.120
we...

01:22:41.122 --> 01:22:42.457
had an affair...

01:22:43.524 --> 01:22:46.561
right after he was
transferred here.

01:22:48.429 --> 01:22:50.228
I...

01:22:50.230 --> 01:22:52.734
He wanted me
to leave my family, but...

01:22:54.702 --> 01:22:56.134
I just couldn't do it.

01:22:56.136 --> 01:22:58.439
He won't leave
me alone.

01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:02.574
And he's using Eli's car
to cover his tracks.

01:23:02.576 --> 01:23:03.811
Oh, God...

01:23:06.814 --> 01:23:08.479
Somebody get me
a cell phone!

01:23:10.283 --> 01:23:11.416
<i>You've reached
Constable Tarasoff.</i>

01:23:11.418 --> 01:23:12.384
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

01:23:12.386 --> 01:23:13.352
Darryl?

01:23:13.354 --> 01:23:15.390
Meet me at Charlene's
as fast as you can.

01:24:31.164 --> 01:24:32.531
Mom?

01:24:32.533 --> 01:24:35.400
Oh, fuck! Shit!

01:24:35.402 --> 01:24:37.602
Shit, shit, shit, shit.
Shit!

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:40.607
Sophie?

01:24:42.376 --> 01:24:43.575
What the fuck, Ali?

01:24:43.577 --> 01:24:45.210
She shot at me, okay?

01:24:45.212 --> 01:24:46.481
Show me.

01:24:47.413 --> 01:24:49.647
Gah!

01:24:49.649 --> 01:24:50.851
What are you doing here?

01:24:52.886 --> 01:24:54.454
Does she know?

01:24:55.155 --> 01:24:56.321
About what?

01:24:56.323 --> 01:24:57.592
About Earl.

01:24:58.458 --> 01:25:00.291
God, you could have had
Brandon killed, you know that?

01:25:00.293 --> 01:25:01.527
It was an accident.

01:25:01.529 --> 01:25:02.527
What is she
talking about, Mom?

01:25:02.529 --> 01:25:04.196
I never meant
for any of this, Soph.

01:25:04.198 --> 01:25:05.229
You've got to know that.

01:25:05.231 --> 01:25:07.232
What is she talking about?

01:25:08.435 --> 01:25:09.904
Tell her.

01:25:13.173 --> 01:25:14.438
Brandon's a fighter.

01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:15.574
All right? I knew that.

01:25:15.576 --> 01:25:17.709
He just had
to take a few hits from Earl

01:25:17.711 --> 01:25:19.644
before the police got there.

01:25:19.646 --> 01:25:20.612
That's...

01:25:20.614 --> 01:25:22.380
just custody is all I wanted,
okay, babe?

01:25:22.382 --> 01:25:23.682
I just wanted
to take care of you.

01:25:23.684 --> 01:25:24.819
I never meant...

01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:27.285
What the fuck?

01:25:27.287 --> 01:25:28.486
No, Sophie,
you've got to believe me.

01:25:28.488 --> 01:25:29.287
You had Dad killed.

01:25:29.289 --> 01:25:30.589
No, no,
that's not what happened.

01:25:30.591 --> 01:25:31.790
That is exactly
what happened!

01:25:31.792 --> 01:25:33.392
He's fucking dead, Mom.

01:25:33.394 --> 01:25:34.393
Nobody was supposed
to die, all right?

01:25:34.395 --> 01:25:36.361
I never meant that.
You've got to believe me.

01:25:36.363 --> 01:25:37.565
She didn't do it.

01:25:39.632 --> 01:25:40.699
It was Chief.

01:25:40.701 --> 01:25:41.968
What?

01:25:43.436 --> 01:25:45.571
We've got to get
out of here.

01:25:45.573 --> 01:25:47.238
Shit...

01:25:48.341 --> 01:25:49.510
Oh, God...

01:25:50.543 --> 01:25:52.180
Shit.

01:25:53.213 --> 01:25:54.446
Let's get her in the corner.

01:25:55.882 --> 01:25:56.815
We're going
to hide her.

01:26:01.622 --> 01:26:03.057
Take this.

01:26:04.824 --> 01:26:05.892
Look at me.

01:26:06.926 --> 01:26:10.030
Chief comes in here,
you shoot him.

01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:14.900
Okay. Okay...

01:26:14.902 --> 01:26:18.138
Baby, I'm so sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.

01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:30.715
Police! Open up!

01:26:30.717 --> 01:26:31.782
Darryl!

01:26:31.784 --> 01:26:33.488
Ali, you okay?

01:26:34.822 --> 01:26:35.754
We need
an ambulance, though.

01:26:35.756 --> 01:26:36.787
What happened?

01:26:36.789 --> 01:26:38.726
Don't fucking move.

01:26:39.659 --> 01:26:41.229
Drop it.

01:26:41.962 --> 01:26:43.264
Drop it!

01:26:45.865 --> 01:26:47.799
The belt, Darryl,

01:26:47.801 --> 01:26:48.970
and the vest,
come on.

01:26:49.837 --> 01:26:50.835
Fucking move it!

01:26:50.837 --> 01:26:52.504
Okay.

01:26:52.506 --> 01:26:53.537
Throw it over here.

01:26:53.539 --> 01:26:54.839
Okay, okay.

01:26:54.841 --> 01:26:56.575
Toss it!

01:26:56.577 --> 01:26:57.608
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:26:57.610 --> 01:26:59.343
What
are you doing?

01:26:59.345 --> 01:27:00.812
Hey, I radioed for backup.

01:27:00.814 --> 01:27:02.680
They're on the way.

01:27:02.682 --> 01:27:03.885
Fucking move it, Darryl!

01:27:05.985 --> 01:27:06.985
Okay.

01:27:06.987 --> 01:27:08.756
Everyone knows.

01:27:09.890 --> 01:27:12.324
They know about the affair.

01:27:12.326 --> 01:27:13.793
They know about Earl.

01:27:15.362 --> 01:27:16.931
This was never
about Earl.

01:27:18.032 --> 01:27:19.063
He was a bonus,

01:27:19.065 --> 01:27:22.401
a body to plant.

01:27:22.403 --> 01:27:24.001
After tonight,

01:27:24.003 --> 01:27:27.607
Keith is going to know
exactly how it feels...

01:27:28.876 --> 01:27:30.778
child for a child.

01:27:32.345 --> 01:27:33.680
That'll be justice.

01:27:34.547 --> 01:27:36.882
He was your kid.

01:27:36.884 --> 01:27:38.218
You and Helen...

01:27:38.985 --> 01:27:40.253
Kid?

01:27:41.622 --> 01:27:42.857
Yeah, my kid, hmm?

01:27:44.024 --> 01:27:46.561
His name was Eli.

01:27:50.064 --> 01:27:51.028
What the fuck are you doing?

01:27:54.001 --> 01:27:55.636
They did this to me, Darryl.

01:27:56.502 --> 01:27:57.738
I had no choice.

01:28:11.918 --> 01:28:13.852
Would Eli really want
so many people dead?

01:28:13.854 --> 01:28:15.156
You shut your fucking mouth!

01:28:17.056 --> 01:28:18.857
Earl and Brandon...

01:28:18.859 --> 01:28:21.026
that's all this needed to be.

01:28:21.028 --> 01:28:22.626
I had your fucking brother
right there.

01:28:22.628 --> 01:28:24.664
All he had to do
was stay put...

01:28:25.865 --> 01:28:27.935
and now I got you.

01:28:29.869 --> 01:28:31.071
That's my justice.
