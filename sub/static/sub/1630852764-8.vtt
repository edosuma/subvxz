00:35.827 --> 00:42.250


01:12.697 --> 01:13.823
My best friend,

01:14.574 --> 01:15.450
gone.

01:16.534 --> 01:17.744
It was all my fault.

01:19.621 --> 01:22.874
I have to make things right,
even if it's the last thing I do, but how?

01:23.458 --> 01:24.667
How?

01:26.002 --> 01:28.922
I'm only one small gnome.

01:35.887 --> 01:39.265
Yes! Yes, that's the perfect way
to end that cutscene.

01:39.349 --> 01:40.892
The guilt thing is epic!

01:40.975 --> 01:43.061
Here's the thing. Is gnome the way to go?

01:43.144 --> 01:45.980
Excellent point. Maybe a halfling?

01:46.064 --> 01:49.901
-Yes! Then we can give him the luck trait.
-Yes! I knew you'd be the perfect partner!

01:49.984 --> 01:51.694
-Sophie, Kyle.

01:51.778 --> 01:52.612
Hey, Mom.

01:52.695 --> 01:54.364
Uh, we were just--

01:54.447 --> 01:56.699
Having fun? It's wonderful.

01:56.783 --> 01:59.202
-Yeah, but I… I should be working.
-Eventually.

01:59.285 --> 02:01.704
It's all good! I gotta bounce.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.706
Anyway, talk to you later, Puck?

02:03.790 --> 02:04.833
Bye, Puck's mom.

02:04.916 --> 02:06.334
-Bye, Sophie.
-Bye!

02:15.343 --> 02:16.177
Morning.

02:16.719 --> 02:18.012
Good morning, Isaac.

02:18.513 --> 02:20.890
You actually got
Rebecca down for a morning nap?

02:21.683 --> 02:22.600
Congratulations!

02:22.684 --> 02:25.812
Yeah, I'm not sure what I did right,
but I will take the blessing.

02:25.895 --> 02:28.189
Even had time to make
a pot of my special coffee

02:28.273 --> 02:29.941
and start a to-do list.

02:30.024 --> 02:32.610
-Here, try some.
-That's a pretty long list.

02:35.321 --> 02:36.698
Wait, this is delicious!

02:36.781 --> 02:39.784
I promise to share
my secret recipe with you when I move out,

02:39.868 --> 02:41.619
so long as you swear not to tell.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.621
Your secret's safe with me.

02:44.998 --> 02:48.418
You're already dealing with so much.
Stay as long as you like.

02:48.501 --> 02:51.212
You did not sign up for a newborn.

02:51.296 --> 02:54.048
If I can get Rebecca to sleep
for 30 more minutes,

02:54.132 --> 02:55.758
I can look at more Zillow leads.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.719
Even if I had reservations pending,

02:58.469 --> 02:59.596
which I don't…

02:59.679 --> 03:01.764
…I can't imagine meeting
someone as nice as you.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.267
Plus, there's
a whole lotta weird out there.

03:05.351 --> 03:06.644
Weirder than…?

03:07.812 --> 03:08.646
Two words.

03:08.730 --> 03:09.898
Pet chickens.

03:11.649 --> 03:15.069
And here are some signatures
I collected from my neighborhood.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.741
Wow! That is quite a haul.

03:19.824 --> 03:22.076
Well, I… I might have instigated
just a pinch,

03:22.160 --> 03:24.120
but this side of legal, I swear.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.788
What exactly did you do?

03:25.872 --> 03:28.041
There's this water valve
that's been leaking for months.

03:28.124 --> 03:29.709
It's just flooding the playground.

03:29.792 --> 03:32.545
So when I explained
how my siblings can't play

03:32.629 --> 03:36.424
and possibly brought them along with me
for additional emphasis…

03:36.507 --> 03:38.176
Smart using your personal story.

03:38.259 --> 03:41.346
Yeah, but then people opened up,
and I discovered everyone seems to be mad

03:41.429 --> 03:43.890
about something or other
Mayor Lewis hasn't come through on.

03:43.973 --> 03:47.602
You know, Helen, CeCe reminds me
a lot of you when you were younger.

03:47.685 --> 03:49.687
I wasn't very political.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.649
My head in the clouds,
I suppose, but you inspire me.

03:53.149 --> 03:57.570
Among the many things our friendship
has taught me, dear heart, I know this.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.323
That there is nothing
we can't accomplish together.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.411
I wish I had friends
like y'all are to each other.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.872
Doesn't seem to be
a girl in Serenity who gets me.

04:07.956 --> 04:11.584
You keep carving out the life you want.
The right people will come alongside.

04:12.168 --> 04:13.711
Back to our bad mayor.

04:13.795 --> 04:16.464
What kinda schooling
would someone need to be a good mayor?

04:16.547 --> 04:18.258
There are a number of roads,

04:18.341 --> 04:21.344
but a degree in law
or public administration

04:21.427 --> 04:22.595
would be a great start.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.264
A law degree? Hmm.

04:25.598 --> 04:28.935
-Like the one you've got, Miss Helen?
-Stay focused, please.

04:33.898 --> 04:37.694
I know last night was awkward.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.737
Oh, for everyone.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.823
-Do we have to talk about this?
-Yes!

04:42.323 --> 04:44.284
We gave you some time to process,

04:44.367 --> 04:46.786
but I… I feel like
something more is going on here.

04:46.869 --> 04:49.747
Nope. Pretty much
just complete and total embarrassment.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.458
Well, I'm sure you have questions--

04:52.542 --> 04:55.712
Even though what's going on
between your father and me

04:55.795 --> 04:58.256
is between your father and me.

04:58.339 --> 05:00.341
Why didn't you tell me
you two are back together?

05:00.425 --> 05:01.759
-We're not.
-We were waiting.

05:03.761 --> 05:07.390
Uh, listen, sweetheart, this sort of thing
can happen when people are separated.

05:07.473 --> 05:10.560
It's bad enough you two had
whatever that was in the living room,

05:10.643 --> 05:12.562
but now you can't even agree
on what it meant?

05:12.645 --> 05:15.606
-It must be very confusing for you.
-And for you, apparently.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.692
-Annie!
-Can we stop talking about this?!

05:17.775 --> 05:19.110
I'm sorry I walked in on you!

05:19.193 --> 05:21.988
I'm sorry I got my hopes up,
and I'm sorry that nothing has changed!

05:22.071 --> 05:22.905
Baby girl…

05:22.989 --> 05:25.575
-May I be excused, please? I need to--
-Yes.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.545
Thank you for driving me
all the way to Charleston.

05:37.628 --> 05:40.089
This was not the ideal date,
I admit.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.675
-Are we calling this a date?
-We should not.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.011
I was happy
to be there with you.

05:45.094 --> 05:48.806
Well, I'm glad you were.
I'm grateful for your reassuring presence.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.725
My pleasure, truly.

05:52.101 --> 05:53.186
How you feelin'?

05:54.937 --> 05:57.065
Seven follicles isn't the worst news.

05:57.148 --> 05:58.358
It's not…

05:58.441 --> 06:01.652
It's not the best but not the worst.

06:03.154 --> 06:04.072
I'm okay.

06:05.114 --> 06:06.074
I'm okay.

06:08.034 --> 06:12.538
"Okay" is one of those words
that doesn't really mean anything.

06:13.831 --> 06:16.709
People tend to use it
to spackle over a deeper truth.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.006
I am not okay.

06:24.842 --> 06:26.219
I am not…

06:26.302 --> 06:30.556
I am not fine
or resolute or certain or blissful,

06:30.640 --> 06:32.725
and I wanna be all of those things.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.603
I've always set a goal and achieved it.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.606
There is nothing I couldn't do

06:39.440 --> 06:41.025
once I set my mind to it…

06:42.235 --> 06:44.112
…until this.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.116
I thought I had reached it,

06:48.616 --> 06:53.663
but I'm standing on the edge of a lake
with no way to tell how thin the ice is

06:53.746 --> 06:55.331
and whether I can get across.

06:56.624 --> 07:00.753
"Now faith is the substantiating
of things hoped for,

07:01.754 --> 07:04.632
the conviction of things not seen."

07:06.050 --> 07:07.093
Mm-hmm.

07:07.176 --> 07:08.970
-Hey, hey, hey.

07:10.304 --> 07:11.931
I really appreciate you.

07:13.391 --> 07:14.725
Entirely mutual.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.022
We, uh…

07:21.899 --> 07:24.360
we've earned ourselves
a little adventure, don't you think?

07:24.444 --> 07:27.071
Now, how can I resist
an invitation like that?

07:33.786 --> 07:36.289
-Okay, let's take a breather.
-No, I can keep going.

07:36.789 --> 07:39.167
-You need to rest between reps.

07:39.834 --> 07:40.751
And hydrate.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.176
What else is on your mind?

07:48.259 --> 07:50.178
You looking forward
to the fundraiser tonight?

07:50.761 --> 07:54.432
Taking your mom somewhere fancy
outweighs me having to wear a tux.

07:55.057 --> 07:57.268
That is not what you were thinking about.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.228
CeCe ghosted me.

08:00.688 --> 08:04.150
I mean, she's crazy busy, but she was
still the one always texting me.

08:04.901 --> 08:07.570
And all of a sudden, just silence.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.698
Did she say she needed time or space or--

08:10.781 --> 08:12.116
She didn't say anything.

08:12.783 --> 08:15.203
Just be patient with her. And yourself.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.288
If I hear that word one more time…

08:18.456 --> 08:20.666
Why do I always have to be
the patient one?

08:21.209 --> 08:22.418
I'm sick of waiting.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.463
"Wait until your arm's better."
"Wait until the divorce is over."

08:25.546 --> 08:27.715
"Wait until everything
just stops going wrong."

08:28.966 --> 08:30.384
What if it never gets any better?

08:30.468 --> 08:32.011
Don't do that to yourself.

08:32.970 --> 08:34.972
Worrying about the future
doesn't change it.

08:35.806 --> 08:39.227
Think about today.
What… what you want. What you <i>can</i> control.

08:39.727 --> 08:40.978
And all those things

08:41.062 --> 08:45.816
that don't turn out the way you hoped,
cross those bridges when you get to them.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.276
I'm gonna come to them.

08:48.402 --> 08:50.321
That's not what I'm saying, Ty.

08:51.155 --> 08:53.282
If the end of my career
taught me anything,

08:53.366 --> 08:55.868
it was to leave myself open

08:56.661 --> 08:59.247
to options, choices.

09:00.039 --> 09:03.501
When I stopped playing, did I think
that I was gonna go back to school

09:03.584 --> 09:06.128
and become a teacher and a coach?

09:06.212 --> 09:07.046
No.

09:08.881 --> 09:09.757
But here I am.

09:11.259 --> 09:14.804
And I'm glad I did
because now I know you and your teammates.

09:15.596 --> 09:16.430
And my mom.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.226
Yeah, and your mom.

09:23.312 --> 09:25.022
And I feel great about the future.

09:28.651 --> 09:29.944
Don't limit yourself.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.031
Don't define yourself by any one thing.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.825
But it's <i>been</i> the only thing.

09:36.951 --> 09:38.202
For such a long time.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.330
Then maybe it's time for a change.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.422
I just wanna stop picturing it.

09:49.505 --> 09:52.174
It could be worse. One time, my parents--

09:52.258 --> 09:54.302
Please! Please don't tell me.

09:56.387 --> 10:00.391
And the worst part is
that<i> I </i>have to be completely transparent,

10:00.474 --> 10:02.226
like, all the time,

10:02.310 --> 10:04.437
and they're sneaking around
behind my back.

10:05.187 --> 10:06.063
Hypocrites.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.065
I thought you wanted them
to get back together.

10:08.649 --> 10:10.693
I did.

10:11.235 --> 10:12.111
I do.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.823
But they're treating it
like it's something to be ashamed of.

10:15.906 --> 10:17.658
Something to keep secret from me,

10:17.742 --> 10:19.994
and that just feels so weird that I--

10:24.999 --> 10:27.752
Annabelle, your break was over
five minutes ago.

10:27.835 --> 10:28.794
Miss Sullivan, I--

10:28.878 --> 10:30.921
-Can I get you a table, Jackson?
-No, ma'am.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.268
Need I remind you

10:44.352 --> 10:47.188
to keep family business
within the family, young lady?

11:10.670 --> 11:12.546
This is spectacular!

11:12.630 --> 11:15.341
-Oh, only because you're here.

11:15.424 --> 11:17.468
Hello, gorgeous. How are you tonight?

11:18.177 --> 11:19.387
-Cheers.

11:19.970 --> 11:22.098
You have yourself
a nice night, over there.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.019
You know, before all the hoopla begins,

11:27.103 --> 11:29.522
I wanna spend some alone time

11:29.605 --> 11:32.775
with the most beautiful woman
in South Carolina.

11:33.317 --> 11:34.944
I just made it to State?

11:35.653 --> 11:37.321
Most beautiful woman on the planet?

11:37.822 --> 11:39.865
-Nice save, Coach.

11:48.833 --> 11:52.545
So, what is all of this hoopla
of which you speak?

11:52.628 --> 11:54.088
Oh, you'll see.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.217
I think it's great
that so many people wanna meet you,

11:58.718 --> 12:00.970
and you're doing your fair share
for a worthy cause.

12:01.053 --> 12:05.558
I, uh, know I should be more grateful,
but, honestly, all this attention

12:07.309 --> 12:09.270
was always more Victoria's thing.

12:09.770 --> 12:12.565
She thrived on the pretentious part of it.

12:13.357 --> 12:14.567
But being here with you,

12:16.235 --> 12:17.611
it's all so different.

12:18.946 --> 12:21.407
I just wanna savor this moment
while we can.

12:24.326 --> 12:25.703
Oh!

12:26.495 --> 12:28.205
Well, I'm happy to oblige.

12:28.289 --> 12:29.957
-Hmm!

12:36.756 --> 12:38.591
Ma'am, may I speak with you?

12:38.674 --> 12:40.593
What can I do for you, Jackson?

12:40.676 --> 12:44.305
I apologize for making Annie late
coming back from her break.

12:46.474 --> 12:50.227
Well, Annie is responsible
for her own clock.

12:51.562 --> 12:53.272
But I appreciate the apology.

12:57.276 --> 12:58.360
There something more?

12:59.111 --> 13:03.657
I was hoping you'd give me your permission
to take Annie out on a date,

13:03.741 --> 13:04.742
a formal date.

13:04.825 --> 13:07.912
-I know you're not my biggest fan.
-Well, now, don't put--

13:07.995 --> 13:11.665
And you're not a big fan
of my mom either, but she raised me right,

13:11.749 --> 13:14.627
which is why I'm asking.
I… I didn't wanna sneak around.

13:14.710 --> 13:17.087
I really like Annie, Miss Sullivan,

13:17.171 --> 13:19.965
and that's why
I wanna go about this the right way.

13:28.432 --> 13:30.976
-We have rules in our house.
-Yes, ma'am.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.229
And the quickest way
to get in trouble with me

13:33.312 --> 13:36.982
is to encourage Annie
to break any of those rules.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.234
I respect that

13:39.276 --> 13:41.529
and her and you, ma'am.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.074
Well, then you have my permission.

13:46.575 --> 13:49.245
But the decision
rests with Annie, of course.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.287
Of course.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.039
Thank you very much.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.126
-Is there anything else?
-No, ma'am.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.642
Good.
Absolutely stunning. Great.

14:11.725 --> 14:13.644
Coach Cal. Coach Cal.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.064
So, uh, here's all the hoopla.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.358
It's intense.

14:19.441 --> 14:22.361
I didn't realize, but that's why
your friend asked you, right?

14:22.444 --> 14:23.904
'Cause all the fans love you?

14:23.988 --> 14:27.908
Well, you love me,
and I'd rather go home with…

14:28.951 --> 14:29.785
Jodie!

14:29.869 --> 14:31.495
-You're good.
-Yes, fine.

14:31.579 --> 14:32.872
I'm so glad she came.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.500
…then Cal is a good decision…

14:40.713 --> 14:42.548
You look handsome!

14:42.631 --> 14:45.217
You look beautiful.

14:46.260 --> 14:50.139
Uh, hi. Um, I'm Jodie.
Cal and I used to work together.

14:50.222 --> 14:52.391
Uh, sorry, this is, um…

14:53.100 --> 14:55.603
M-A-D-D-I-E.

14:55.686 --> 14:57.479
-Maddie! Nice to meet you.
-Yeah.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.231
-Nice to meet you too.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.233
Jodie used to work
at the agency that repped me.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.068
Is she your sweetheart?

15:03.152 --> 15:04.653
More than…

15:07.489 --> 15:11.368
Oh! Um, so, Cal,
we were just looking for you.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.579
You are on deck for pictures.

15:14.663 --> 15:18.626
So my assistant, Connie,
is going to help you over there.

15:19.376 --> 15:22.630
-Okay, then. Um… Uh, I won't be long.

15:22.713 --> 15:24.632
Don't say that!

15:24.715 --> 15:27.176
You have a lot of really excited people

15:27.259 --> 15:29.303
waiting in line
to take a picture with you.

15:31.430 --> 15:34.892
Oh, don't worry about her.
I'll keep an eye on her.

15:34.975 --> 15:38.062
While you're gone, I'll make sure
no one tries to steal her from you.

15:38.145 --> 15:40.064
Always got my back,
dear friend.

15:40.147 --> 15:41.732
Always, dear friend.

15:44.151 --> 15:46.070
I love your necklace!

15:46.153 --> 15:48.906
Oh, thank you. It was my grandmother's.

15:48.989 --> 15:51.784
And then my grandmother
gave it to my mother, my mother to me,

15:51.867 --> 15:54.870
and one day, I'll give it to my daughter.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.538
-I love your dress.

15:56.622 --> 15:57.790
Oh, thank you.

15:57.873 --> 16:01.085
-It doesn't have a sweet story, but--
-It's beautiful.

16:01.168 --> 16:04.088
-Cal, can I get a picture?
-How long have you known Cal?

16:04.797 --> 16:06.048
Feels like forever!

16:06.799 --> 16:09.885
The two of us met
way back when we first started.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.262
We were both rookies.
He could be a handful.

16:12.346 --> 16:13.555
Do tell.

16:13.639 --> 16:16.183
-Not my place.

16:16.266 --> 16:18.268
He's different now anyways.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.604
I could see it right when you walked up.

16:21.855 --> 16:25.526
Should I be crediting
Serenity or you for that change?

16:25.609 --> 16:27.820
He gets all the credit for who he is.

16:28.862 --> 16:29.822
Oh, I see.

16:30.698 --> 16:31.532
Definitely you.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.996
Has he told you a lot about

16:37.830 --> 16:38.706
Vicky?

16:38.789 --> 16:40.791
Enough.

16:40.874 --> 16:45.504
That woman started drama
everywhere she went.

16:45.587 --> 16:47.089
She contributed nothing

16:47.172 --> 16:51.510
but was constantly
taking credit for all of his success.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.054
That's unfortunate.

16:54.138 --> 16:57.057
Well, it looks like he learned from it

16:57.558 --> 16:59.268
because you, my dear,

17:00.853 --> 17:02.604
are a lovely color on him.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.985
What if we make him reanimated
instead of just undead?

17:08.068 --> 17:10.029
You have
something against the undead?

17:10.112 --> 17:11.697
Am I interrupting?

17:11.780 --> 17:13.240
Or saving us from ourselves.

17:13.323 --> 17:14.408
Hard to tell.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.493
-Hey, Sophie.
-Hey.

17:16.577 --> 17:19.288
Willow, this is my big brother, Ty.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.331
-Wow. Hi.
-It's nice to meet you.

17:23.125 --> 17:26.295
So, what else needs to happen
in this level? We're good, right?

17:26.378 --> 17:28.172
Actually, I don't think we are.

17:28.255 --> 17:30.549
You're giving the paladin
way too much narrative focus

17:30.632 --> 17:32.843
and not giving the rest of the characters,

17:32.926 --> 17:35.637
especially
the female-identifying ones, enough.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.474
-Willow has a grudge against paladins.

17:38.557 --> 17:41.060
You know, I promised my mom
I would be a good host.

17:41.143 --> 17:43.979
-Do y'all want root beer?
-Oh, sure! Thanks.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.481
I'll help.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.027
Earth to Willow?

17:50.569 --> 17:51.487
Okay, back to it.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.992
-What?
-What?

17:57.076 --> 17:59.787
I guess you missed the memo
that gaming is cool, and--

17:59.870 --> 18:01.622
Dude, I'm just happy for you.

18:02.414 --> 18:03.248
Excuse me?!

18:03.332 --> 18:05.918
It's just great to see you with friends.

18:06.919 --> 18:10.380
Gabe's the only one
who's really talking to me right now.

18:10.464 --> 18:13.383
I don't know whether the rest of them
think I'm contagious

18:13.467 --> 18:17.054
or boring because I don't wanna talk
about girls or baseball.

18:17.721 --> 18:18.555
That's stupid.

18:18.639 --> 18:21.683
You got so much more to offer anybody
who's smart enough to pay attention.

18:21.767 --> 18:22.684
Thanks, man.

18:24.019 --> 18:26.271
So, Sophie. She's cute.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.397
Stop.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.733
No, she's super smart.

18:30.651 --> 18:31.819
And Willow's fun.

18:33.987 --> 18:36.782
You know, we're really digging deep
to expand the universe of the game.

18:36.865 --> 18:39.201
Yeah, looks like
your universe is expanding too.

18:39.284 --> 18:40.452
Oh! Oh really?

18:40.536 --> 18:41.787
Hey, seriously! Stop!

18:41.870 --> 18:43.664
I'm just happy for you, man. Come on!

18:43.747 --> 18:45.457
-Okay.

18:45.541 --> 18:47.709
And maybe a little jealous.

18:51.213 --> 18:54.258
I guess maybe Dad not being invested
in anything I've ever done

18:54.341 --> 18:55.801
worked to my advantage for once.

18:55.884 --> 18:57.427
You know, I gotta try out new things

18:57.511 --> 19:01.056
without him standing over me
every second, pushing and…

19:03.934 --> 19:04.768
I'm sorry.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.270
Oh, don't be.

19:07.437 --> 19:08.814
I just… I wish

19:09.731 --> 19:11.775
there was something besides baseball

19:11.859 --> 19:15.112
I could just dive into for a while.

19:17.531 --> 19:18.615
It's not too late.

19:28.041 --> 19:29.501
Uh! Wow.

19:29.585 --> 19:33.338
Oh, I knew it was dangerous
to leave the two of you alone.

19:34.339 --> 19:37.009
Did you tell her
all of my deep, dark secrets, Jodie?

19:37.092 --> 19:39.469
Mmm, only the juicy ones.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.680
I don't know that I'm gonna be able
to get over the fact

19:41.763 --> 19:45.309
that you used to put iced coffee
over your Cheerios?!

19:45.392 --> 19:46.810
What do you mean, "used to"?

19:47.311 --> 19:49.104
It's efficient and tasty.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.564
I should go mingle,

19:50.647 --> 19:54.067
uh, but it was a pleasure, Maddie.

19:54.151 --> 19:55.652
-Pleasure.
-Cal…

19:55.736 --> 19:57.362
We will talk soon.

20:01.950 --> 20:05.412
She's very fond of you,
which is understandable.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.416
-May I have another dance?
-Yeah!

20:09.499 --> 20:12.127
Excuse me, Mr. Maddox. I'm Stu.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.213
Uh, call me Cal, please.

20:14.296 --> 20:18.050
Cal, thank you so much
for supporting this important cause.

20:18.133 --> 20:20.177
I'm so honored to have
my picture taken with you.

20:20.260 --> 20:23.764
Wonder if I can impose just a bit further
and have you sign your card for me?

20:24.514 --> 20:25.432
I'm happy to.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.477
Baseball's kinda everything to me.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.854
I'm barely athletic enough
to tie my own shoes.

20:31.855 --> 20:34.942
Dad and I loved goin' to games
since I was knee-high to a duck.

20:35.025 --> 20:37.361
We were there for the home game
against the Nats you saved

20:37.444 --> 20:40.405
with that amazing sliding catch
in the bottom of the 8th. Remember that?

20:40.489 --> 20:42.783
-I do. That was a great day.
-Hmm.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.285
-Lucky catch.
-No luck about it.

20:45.369 --> 20:48.664
-Pure skill. You're a star.
-That's mighty kind of you.

20:48.747 --> 20:51.458
Don't mean to run at the mouth.
That game is just so important to me.

20:51.541 --> 20:53.126
Dad's been gone almost a year now.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.379
That was the last game we went to
before he got sick.

20:55.462 --> 20:59.424
So I just kinda think of it
as a gift from the heavens, from you.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.139
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.101
I lost my father too,

21:10.519 --> 21:12.354
and I know how important
those memories are.

21:19.611 --> 21:22.489
-Hope you know what a special guy you got.
-Oh, I sure do.

21:23.615 --> 21:26.076
Thank you again. Have a good night.

21:33.458 --> 21:34.876
Sorry to keep you waiting.

21:36.753 --> 21:38.588
What's that line that…

21:39.381 --> 21:42.801
"Baseball is a game for sons and fathers"?

21:45.929 --> 21:47.681
It means a lot to a lot of people.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.226
Did your dad
ever see you play professionally?

21:58.608 --> 22:01.236
Do you know
how grateful I am to have you in my life?

22:03.155 --> 22:06.450
Well, I think that my gratitude stat

22:06.533 --> 22:09.703
is a little higher than yours, Mr. MVP.

22:10.370 --> 22:11.330
Huh.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.458
Then would you mind terribly
if I kissed you grandly,

22:14.541 --> 22:17.586
right here, right now,
in front of all these strangers?

22:17.669 --> 22:20.297
They're not strangers. They're fans.

22:41.985 --> 22:43.445
This is a surprise.

22:43.528 --> 22:46.531
Yeah, I'm kinda done
with the whole surprise thing right now.

22:47.282 --> 22:49.785
Excuse me?
Why don't you take a breath?

22:49.868 --> 22:52.829
I took a breath, Dana Sue.
I let our daughter take a breath,

22:52.913 --> 22:55.624
and neither one of us
has the answer we've been waiting for.

22:58.710 --> 23:00.545
Well, this is between you and me.

23:01.046 --> 23:04.633
And as much as I love our daughter,
she's just gonna have to cool her jets.

23:05.133 --> 23:06.927
Okay, then, between you and me,

23:07.010 --> 23:10.597
what on God's green earth
is holding you back?

23:10.680 --> 23:12.391
Because I need to know.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.019
Okay.

23:17.437 --> 23:21.817
So you thought
storming into my place of business

23:22.442 --> 23:24.528
was some way to hold my feet to the fire?!

23:24.611 --> 23:27.072
-I acknowledge my wrongs!
-Ugh!

23:27.155 --> 23:30.826
I have spent almost two years
working to clean up the mess I made.

23:30.909 --> 23:32.494
We deserve a fresh start.

23:32.577 --> 23:36.665
-The other night, you were--
-The other night was nostalgia.

23:36.748 --> 23:37.958
Your cologne.

23:38.625 --> 23:39.960
Old habits…

23:40.043 --> 23:41.837
It was truth!

23:41.920 --> 23:43.255
It was connection!

23:43.338 --> 23:44.297
It was us.

23:45.674 --> 23:46.633
<i>Is</i> us.

23:46.716 --> 23:49.219
And you cannot look me in the eye
and deny it

23:49.302 --> 23:53.056
because I know you felt it
just as strongly as I did.

23:53.890 --> 23:55.767
Chemistry was never our problem,

23:56.810 --> 24:01.273
but chemistry is not enough
to carry us through.

24:01.356 --> 24:02.899
What else do you need from me?

24:02.983 --> 24:05.444
Proof that things have changed.

24:05.527 --> 24:08.405
You talk an awful lot
about how things need to change.

24:08.488 --> 24:10.115
-Hmm.
-But let's be real.

24:10.198 --> 24:12.909
What you're <i>really</i> saying
is <i>I </i>need to change,

24:12.993 --> 24:15.245
and I have, but <i>you</i> refuse to see it!

24:15.328 --> 24:18.081
And while you're updating the score,
sweetheart,

24:18.165 --> 24:22.419
why is it everybody else
has to change but you?

24:37.350 --> 24:38.935
-Nana?
-Mm-hmm?

24:39.019 --> 24:40.729
How many S's are in "princess"?

24:40.812 --> 24:42.230
Mmm, two.

24:43.607 --> 24:45.108
Oh, but only one N.

24:46.234 --> 24:49.362
Are you telling Rebecca
that she's gonna be a princess, Katydid?

24:49.446 --> 24:52.157
I'm telling her
if she wants to be a princess, she can.

24:52.240 --> 24:55.243
But if she wants to be an astronaut,
that's okay too.

24:55.327 --> 24:58.205
-Nana, how do you spell "astronaut"?
-Mm-hmm?

24:58.288 --> 25:01.791
-Oh, okay. A-S…
-You don't need me to go, do you?

25:01.875 --> 25:03.877
Noreen and I aren't exactly close.

25:03.960 --> 25:06.505
Well, this isn't about Noreen.
It's about the baby.

25:06.588 --> 25:07.547
Dad's baby.

25:08.340 --> 25:11.468
A baby who had no voice
in who her parents are

25:11.551 --> 25:12.594
or how she came to be.

25:12.677 --> 25:14.429
You and Noreen
should get to know each other

25:14.513 --> 25:16.765
without Dad and baseball
and all that stuff in the way.

25:16.848 --> 25:19.309
What?
Why do I need to be her friend?

25:19.392 --> 25:22.771
You don't need to be her friend,
but you are her neighbor,

25:23.438 --> 25:25.815
in the community
and in the Christian sense.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.776
And I'm asking you to be charitable.

25:27.859 --> 25:33.698
That baby deserves a future
not clouded over by her father's mistakes.

25:34.449 --> 25:35.450
Just like you do.

25:37.452 --> 25:40.121
Look, you're old enough
to make your own decision,

25:41.373 --> 25:44.251
but it would be lovely for you to join us.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.796
How do you spell "paleontologist"?

25:47.879 --> 25:50.507
I guess I had better put on a nice shirt.

25:58.098 --> 25:59.558
Thanks for meeting me here.

25:59.641 --> 26:03.103
All the stuff going on between my mom
and her friends and your dad,

26:03.186 --> 26:05.647
we have to be careful
about who sees us talking.

26:05.730 --> 26:07.315
That's their mess, not mine.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.693
My parents never gave a lick
about my opinion on anything,

26:09.776 --> 26:11.319
so why should I care about theirs?

26:11.403 --> 26:13.863
Right. I don't know
where I stand with my folks half the time

26:13.947 --> 26:17.325
or with anyone most of the time,
for that matter.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.744
Well, I could tell you
where you stand with me.

26:20.495 --> 26:22.664
And I hope I know where I stand with you.

26:27.377 --> 26:29.796
And that's why I wanted a little privacy

26:30.297 --> 26:33.383
and why I got permission
from your mom to take you out.

26:33.967 --> 26:35.218
You asked my mom?

26:35.927 --> 26:38.305
"If a thing's worth doing,
it's worth doing right."

26:38.805 --> 26:40.473
At least, that's what
my grandpa always says

26:40.557 --> 26:42.142
before he tells me what I'm doing wrong.

26:42.225 --> 26:43.435
Oh, no.

26:43.518 --> 26:45.145
Oh no, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

26:45.645 --> 26:46.730
No, I'm not.

26:46.813 --> 26:49.983
So, can I take you on a proper date?

26:51.026 --> 26:53.320
Well, <i>my</i> grandpa always said,

26:53.820 --> 26:56.531
"Why are we standing around
if there are places to go?"

26:57.782 --> 26:59.284
Wait, is that a yes?

26:59.367 --> 27:02.162
-It is, but I can't be late.
-Oh!

27:03.204 --> 27:05.498
-You have another 30 seconds.
-You're counting?

27:05.582 --> 27:06.708
Uh, only

27:07.876 --> 27:08.793
kisses.

27:09.753 --> 27:10.712
Come on.

27:10.795 --> 27:14.007
Have all the time in the world.
What are you talking about?

27:14.090 --> 27:15.634
I have to go to work!

27:22.974 --> 27:27.520
Moving Ellen to the op-ed section
was an excellent decision, Mother.

27:28.146 --> 27:31.274
Now the question is,
what will we do with Donald?

27:32.150 --> 27:37.030
The community desk
will be busier than ever with all of this

27:38.114 --> 27:39.783
recall nonsense,

27:39.866 --> 27:42.077
and he's over his head on a good day.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.037
Are you suggesting we let him go?

27:45.872 --> 27:46.748
No.

27:47.499 --> 27:48.625
His wife is sick.

27:50.126 --> 27:53.797
But your supervision would be appreciated.

27:55.006 --> 27:55.965
Yes, ma'am.

27:57.300 --> 28:00.428
I do have a bit of non-newspaper business
to discuss with you.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.013
I assumed so,

28:02.097 --> 28:05.100
because the rest of this
could have been a quick phone call.

28:05.850 --> 28:08.728
To what do I owe
the pleasure of another visit?

28:09.229 --> 28:12.107
I'm going to tell Isaac's father
that he has a son.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.319
Oh no, you're not.

28:16.403 --> 28:17.862
And why wouldn't I?

28:18.863 --> 28:20.740
Because I don't raise fools.

28:24.035 --> 28:25.161
Mother, I--

28:25.245 --> 28:26.913
Sit back down!

28:27.539 --> 28:30.458
Staging a grand scene will not sway me.

28:36.631 --> 28:40.802
I know you understand
why his mother and I did what we did.

28:41.678 --> 28:43.263
To protect you both.

28:43.888 --> 28:45.515
To protect the three of you.

28:45.598 --> 28:49.811
No, Mother, it was to protect you
and your standing!

28:49.894 --> 28:52.772
It is his right to know.
He should have known from the beginning!

28:52.856 --> 28:54.733
And you think you'd be happy?

28:55.233 --> 28:57.944
You think you'd <i>be</i> with him?

28:59.571 --> 29:00.655
I saved you.

29:01.197 --> 29:05.034
If good sense were leather,
that man couldn't shoe a flea.

29:05.118 --> 29:06.161
That's not fair.

29:06.244 --> 29:08.163
What in life is?

29:09.581 --> 29:11.458
I pray you come to your senses

29:12.292 --> 29:15.628
before you do something
that you cannot set right.

29:15.712 --> 29:20.675
What I want to set right
is my relationship with my son!

29:21.509 --> 29:24.512
I am not a scared 16-year-old girl
anymore, Mother.

29:24.596 --> 29:27.640
I am making the decision my heart demands.

29:28.183 --> 29:29.934
I want Isaac to know everything.

29:30.018 --> 29:32.687
Everything, including who his father is.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.355
You are a fool.

29:34.439 --> 29:35.523
No.

29:35.607 --> 29:39.319
I am simply doing
what any <i>good</i> mother would do.

29:51.831 --> 29:53.500
Oh wow!

29:59.297 --> 30:01.382
I used to come here as a girl.

30:03.551 --> 30:06.888
Read for hours, soak up the solitude.

30:06.971 --> 30:10.141
I used to pretend that I was
the only one who knew about this spot

30:10.225 --> 30:13.061
so I could leave
my deepest thoughts right here.

30:13.144 --> 30:15.355
Then I'd come back
and visit them as needed.

30:15.438 --> 30:16.648
Beautiful.

30:17.190 --> 30:19.567
But now I'm so happy I'm not alone.

30:36.334 --> 30:38.503
Mmm.

30:41.464 --> 30:44.342
But perhaps,
maybe we should, um…

30:45.176 --> 30:47.595
…maybe we should go somewhere
where we <i>are</i> alone?

30:48.221 --> 30:49.055
My house?

30:51.933 --> 30:53.309
Um…

30:53.393 --> 30:55.478
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Did I presume that--

30:55.562 --> 30:57.313
No! Mm-mm-mm.

30:57.397 --> 30:58.731
I'm falling.

30:59.899 --> 31:01.693
<i>Have</i> fallen for you, Helen.

31:02.402 --> 31:03.736
Completely.

31:04.487 --> 31:06.573
There's just so much at play here.

31:06.656 --> 31:09.325
Our path as a potential couple,

31:10.702 --> 31:12.287
your path with IVF.

31:13.788 --> 31:15.957
I mean, it… it seems like they're parallel

31:16.040 --> 31:18.126
but separate.

31:19.836 --> 31:20.795
Does that make sense?

31:21.379 --> 31:22.797
I've fallen for you too.

31:25.633 --> 31:28.011
And I don't wanna mess anything up here.

31:28.511 --> 31:32.223
Intimacy can be found in so many ways.

31:33.850 --> 31:35.560
We don't have to rush into bed.

31:36.352 --> 31:39.022
And you don't have to slow down
having a baby.

31:40.481 --> 31:43.359
Both can happen in their proper time,

31:44.402 --> 31:45.486
and we'll find it

31:46.279 --> 31:47.155
together.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.616
How on earth

31:50.408 --> 31:52.577
could you just put on the brakes

31:52.660 --> 31:56.915
and then make me care for you even more
in one fell swoop?

31:56.998 --> 31:59.000
-Hmm?

31:59.083 --> 32:00.710
Well, as you've noted,

32:00.793 --> 32:02.337
I <i>am</i> a man of many talents.

32:02.420 --> 32:03.254
Mmm.

32:04.297 --> 32:09.928
And I look forward
to discovering each and every one of them.

32:18.561 --> 32:19.938
Mission accomplished!

32:20.021 --> 32:22.941
Every signature line
on this petition is filled.

32:23.942 --> 32:27.570
Good, 'cause we knocked on so many doors,
I think I might have sprained my wrist.

32:28.821 --> 32:33.701
Cal Maddox magic wins people over
for yet another worthy cause.

32:34.202 --> 32:36.204
And here you thought
you didn't have any fans left

32:36.287 --> 32:39.082
after Mary Vaughn
pulled that school board nonsense.

32:39.165 --> 32:42.043
Well, I'd hoped the issues persuaded them,
not my dazzling smile.

32:42.126 --> 32:44.504
Of course. That smile helps too.

32:45.004 --> 32:47.548
As does your willingness
to pose for photos.

32:48.633 --> 32:51.177
I'm genuinely appreciative,
not mocking you.

32:51.260 --> 32:52.220
It's fine.

32:52.303 --> 32:55.390
I just don't need the recognition
and all that comes with it.

32:56.015 --> 32:57.600
It's not how I define myself anymore.

32:57.684 --> 32:59.310
How <i>do</i> you define yourself?

33:00.436 --> 33:02.605
-One blessed guy.

33:03.731 --> 33:06.275
-Mommy! Look at all the names!

33:06.359 --> 33:08.861
What?! This is amazing, Katydid!

33:08.945 --> 33:12.615
Tonight, Katie convinced me
and half of Serenity

33:12.699 --> 33:14.951
that we need a new community pool.

33:15.034 --> 33:19.414
This one delivers
a dangerous mix of charm and tenacity.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.958
-Clearly, some of it's genetic.

33:22.041 --> 33:24.043
-But most of it's you!

33:24.127 --> 33:27.213
Yes! Looks like we have
a politician in the family.

33:27.296 --> 33:29.841
-Paleontologist!
-Oh! Okay.

33:29.924 --> 33:33.302
Well, I would never have imagined
how fun this was going to be.

33:33.386 --> 33:37.432
I got to talk to some folks
I haven't spoken to in a host of Sundays!

33:37.515 --> 33:39.559
We should be rabble-rousers more often.

33:39.642 --> 33:40.893
-Oh yeah!
-Yeah!

33:41.978 --> 33:42.937
Here you go!

33:43.021 --> 33:45.189
Okay! Oh, this is fabulous.

33:45.732 --> 33:46.983
We're gonna do it, y'all!

33:47.608 --> 33:48.860
We're gonna fix our town.

33:48.943 --> 33:50.987
-Whoo!
-Oh, I'm so happy!

33:57.452 --> 33:59.620
Aren't you supposed to sleep
when the baby sleeps?

34:00.371 --> 34:04.167
I tried, but it's nagging me that
if I don't grab these moments to do it,

34:04.250 --> 34:05.710
then nothing will get done.

34:06.210 --> 34:10.256
And the moving
kinda rocks Rebecca to sleep,

34:10.339 --> 34:15.094
or maybe it's the sound of the water.
I don't know. I'm still figuring it out.

34:15.178 --> 34:16.554
You have a seat.

34:16.637 --> 34:19.348
I'll take care of those later
when you're asleep too.

34:19.849 --> 34:21.893
You're spoiling me
something fierce, Isaac.

34:22.852 --> 34:25.021
I'm just plumb tired!

34:25.521 --> 34:28.649
And I feel like I'm messing up
every time I spin around.

34:29.442 --> 34:31.402
I shouldn't be having this much trouble.

34:32.570 --> 34:35.490
Why, because it shouldn't take
more than a week with your first child

34:35.573 --> 34:36.699
to become an expert?

34:37.200 --> 34:38.993
I suppose you're right.

34:39.077 --> 34:42.330
Look. Noreen, Rebecca will be just fine
'cause you love her.

34:42.413 --> 34:46.834
I'm not sure if all the love in the world
can fix the fact that I'm inept at this.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.503
And all alone.

34:48.586 --> 34:50.838
Hey, you got me.

34:51.839 --> 34:54.217
And a whole bunch of people
that care about the both of you.

34:55.176 --> 34:57.970
It was so sweet
of Maddie's kids to come calling today.

34:58.054 --> 34:59.555
Couldn't have been easy for them.

34:59.639 --> 35:01.808
Maddie's such an amazing mom,

35:02.517 --> 35:03.768
amazing person.

35:03.851 --> 35:04.852
So are you.

35:06.395 --> 35:08.314
I don't make a point of sharing this,

35:08.856 --> 35:10.858
but I'm adopted.

35:12.318 --> 35:13.194
Oh!

35:13.277 --> 35:15.404
Uh, my parents were pretty young
when they chose me.

35:15.488 --> 35:16.697
They didn't have a lot,

35:17.532 --> 35:18.616
but they loved me.

35:19.492 --> 35:20.910
They poured themselves into me.

35:20.993 --> 35:23.162
And look how wonderful
you turned out.

35:23.913 --> 35:26.749
Look, we're both looking
for our true place in the world.

35:27.333 --> 35:29.127
I'm not talking about real estate.

35:30.044 --> 35:32.004
So why go through all that on your own?

35:33.256 --> 35:34.298
Stay.

35:36.175 --> 35:38.261
That is so gracious of you.

35:39.220 --> 35:40.471
But

35:41.305 --> 35:43.891
I can't do that unless I pay full rent.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.768
Yeah, I could live with that.

35:45.852 --> 35:48.104
Then we can live with you.

35:48.187 --> 35:50.148
-Awesome.

35:58.614 --> 36:00.616
So the canvassing was successful?

36:00.700 --> 36:03.494
Yeah! I can't believe
how many signatures we got.

36:03.578 --> 36:06.164
Well, you unleashed your secret weapon.

36:06.747 --> 36:08.916
-The famous boyfriend.

36:09.542 --> 36:10.376
Yeah!

36:11.002 --> 36:13.880
I mean, between the fundraiser
and canvassing,

36:13.963 --> 36:16.382
I'm beginning to realize
how different his life was.

36:16.465 --> 36:20.011
It's like a whole new side of Cal,
and… it's kinda hot.

36:20.094 --> 36:23.097
I wish I was seeing
a whole new hot side of Erik.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.850
We're gonna need details, Miss Decatur.

36:25.933 --> 36:28.936
To keep our heads clear, we've decided to

36:29.729 --> 36:31.814
take sex off the table.

36:31.898 --> 36:32.899
For now.

36:33.441 --> 36:35.860
Oh. So it's under the table?

36:35.943 --> 36:38.154
-I'm done with you, Dana Sue.

36:38.237 --> 36:40.239
-You set me right up!

36:40.323 --> 36:43.326
Erik is so fine in so many ways.

36:43.409 --> 36:45.703
Coming to that decision,
that had to be difficult.

36:45.786 --> 36:46.704
It was his idea.

36:46.787 --> 36:49.498
You know, waiting can strengthen
what you have.

36:49.582 --> 36:50.499
I hope so.

36:50.583 --> 36:55.004
I don't want the emotion about one
to distort the emotion about the other.

36:55.588 --> 37:00.092
I'm beginning to think that sex is how
Ronnie and I got into the mess we're in.

37:01.010 --> 37:02.803
You know, chemistry distracted us

37:02.887 --> 37:04.847
from dealing with all the issues
over the years.

37:04.931 --> 37:05.973
Did something happen?

37:06.057 --> 37:10.895
He came in this morning
and accused me of being inflexible.

37:10.978 --> 37:12.021
Hmm.

37:12.104 --> 37:13.439
Can you believe the nerve?

37:16.651 --> 37:17.610
What?!

37:18.319 --> 37:20.154
Well, it's just "flexible,"

37:20.905 --> 37:24.867
it wouldn't… it wouldn't be the first word
that I would use to describe you.

37:24.951 --> 37:25.785
Ah.

37:25.868 --> 37:26.869
Or the fourth.

37:29.580 --> 37:31.624
Okay! Okay.

37:31.707 --> 37:35.211
You can put the mirror away. I see myself.

37:35.294 --> 37:37.922
Hmm. Why can't I figure out my next move?

37:38.005 --> 37:39.924
<i>Our</i> next move.

37:40.007 --> 37:41.509
Usually, when I'm stuck…

37:41.592 --> 37:42.510
Mm-hmm?

37:42.593 --> 37:44.720
…there's something in my path
that I'm afraid of.

37:44.804 --> 37:47.431
"I sought the Lord, and he answered me."

37:48.516 --> 37:50.643
"He delivered me from all my fears."

37:50.726 --> 37:53.562
So we can pour it out. We can pray it out.

37:54.188 --> 37:55.606
We can figure it out.

37:55.690 --> 37:57.400
What are you afraid of, Dana Sue?

38:04.448 --> 38:07.326
Okay, I like <i>this</i> costume
for the female shaman.

38:07.410 --> 38:09.662
Sort of patchwork-slash-homespun,

38:09.745 --> 38:10.997
not… not too Halloween!

38:11.080 --> 38:14.834
Influences of ancient Egypt
and traditional Celtic.

38:14.917 --> 38:17.461
-I don't think it's appropriate.
-Kyle Townsend, you goody-goody.

38:17.545 --> 38:18.921
I'm talking about the sleeves.

38:19.005 --> 38:21.424
It just… it doesn't seem practical
while mixing potions.

38:21.507 --> 38:22.883
Okay, you may have a point.

38:22.967 --> 38:23.926
-Yep.
-May.

38:25.845 --> 38:26.846
Hey, Kyle.

38:28.472 --> 38:30.141
Hey, Nellie. How are you?

38:30.725 --> 38:33.185
Good. I mean, fine.

38:33.894 --> 38:34.812
How's your leg?

38:35.479 --> 38:38.649
I… I'd say ninety… two

38:39.275 --> 38:40.693
and a half percent.

38:40.776 --> 38:41.819
That's wonderful.

38:42.361 --> 38:44.905
Good luck
with the other seven and a half percent.

38:48.034 --> 38:49.118
Come up a sec?

38:52.538 --> 38:54.457
Have you met Nellie
at school or anything?

38:54.540 --> 38:56.959
No. I mean,
I get she's the mayor's daughter

38:57.043 --> 38:59.920
'cause I pay attention, and I know things.
But no, I've never met her.

39:00.880 --> 39:03.215
Uh, Sophie, this is Nellie.
Nellie, Sophie.

39:03.299 --> 39:05.301
We're working
on creating a video game together.

39:05.384 --> 39:07.011
Welcome, wanderer!

39:08.387 --> 39:11.057
Cool! Is it anything like <i>Cuphead?</i>

39:11.140 --> 39:13.100
Kyle is the king of <i>Cuphead!</i>

39:13.184 --> 39:15.019
-But you probably know that.

39:15.102 --> 39:17.605
<i>Cuphead?</i> I had no idea! Cute!

39:17.688 --> 39:19.815
-This is more of an RPG.
-Oh.

39:19.899 --> 39:23.652
4K, 60fps, a draw distance for miles!

39:23.736 --> 39:25.780
-Go big or go home, right?
-Yeah!

39:26.364 --> 39:28.074
You're designing
the whole thing yourselves?

39:28.157 --> 39:30.743
We've gotten a good start
on the world-building

39:30.826 --> 39:33.204
and the general flow
of the main questline,

39:33.287 --> 39:35.164
but there's still so much to do.

39:35.247 --> 39:36.999
I mean, we brainstorm every chance we get.

39:37.083 --> 39:38.542
That's very impressive.

39:40.127 --> 39:41.837
I mean, you're… you're welcome to join us.

39:41.921 --> 39:44.048
Really? I… I… I'd love that!

39:44.131 --> 39:45.174
Cool.

39:45.674 --> 39:47.343
Hey, the more the merrier.

39:47.426 --> 39:49.678
-Join our motley crew.

39:49.762 --> 39:52.306
Cool! So, Nellie,
we're fleshing out the bridge battle

39:52.390 --> 39:53.265
at the end of act one.

39:53.349 --> 39:55.393
Let me show you
some of the sketches Willow did.

39:55.476 --> 39:57.978
The halfling. Check out this guy.
He's three foot…

39:58.062 --> 39:59.438
Thank you.

40:03.109 --> 40:04.068
Peggy.

40:04.151 --> 40:05.152
Helen!

40:05.236 --> 40:08.572
I was looking for Maddie.
A petition follow-up for the paper.

40:08.656 --> 40:10.408
She's not here, but I can help you.

40:10.491 --> 40:12.827
My assistant is verifying
the signatures today.

40:15.121 --> 40:19.291
I… I can call you as… as soon as I hear,

40:19.375 --> 40:23.379
but… I think we're gonna have
enough signatures

40:23.462 --> 40:24.964
to go through with the recall.

40:26.090 --> 40:26.924
Thanks for that.

40:27.591 --> 40:28.509
You're welcome.

40:36.475 --> 40:37.351
Helen.

40:41.230 --> 40:43.899
Thank you for introducing me to my son.

40:58.831 --> 41:01.917
My opinion of Jackson
is beside the point.

41:02.668 --> 41:05.004
-We have faith in Annie…
-Yeah.

41:05.087 --> 41:07.673
…and I had a long talk with her
about making good choices,

41:07.756 --> 41:11.010
so we'll see how their date goes.

41:12.803 --> 41:14.305
Fine. Point taken.

41:16.724 --> 41:19.101
Now, enough about Jackson Lewis.

41:19.185 --> 41:20.060
We

41:21.353 --> 41:24.690
need to get on the same page
about where you and I are headed.

41:27.318 --> 41:28.194
Agreed.

41:29.028 --> 41:31.280
Annie needs some stability right now.

41:32.072 --> 41:32.907
We all do.

41:37.620 --> 41:38.829
I'm scared.

41:40.664 --> 41:42.374
That is what is holding me back.

41:43.584 --> 41:44.460
Pure

41:45.252 --> 41:46.504
200-proof

41:47.379 --> 41:48.214
fear.

41:49.089 --> 41:50.341
Oh, of what?

41:50.925 --> 41:54.094
That I can't trust you.

41:55.137 --> 41:56.055
You know what?

41:57.640 --> 41:58.891
Trust goes both ways,

41:58.974 --> 42:03.187
and I don't trust that you have
any intention of forgiving me.

42:03.270 --> 42:06.857
You act like it's so easy!

42:06.941 --> 42:09.193
I want it to sound necessary!

42:09.276 --> 42:10.611
I am a hamster on a wheel,

42:10.694 --> 42:12.863
and if I don't make
some real progress soon,

42:12.947 --> 42:14.990
my heart is going to burst!

42:15.491 --> 42:17.743
Which is why
I went over to Prince of Peace,

42:18.285 --> 42:20.079
and I spoke with Pastor June.

42:21.163 --> 42:22.373
Why did you do that?

42:22.915 --> 42:24.208
What did you tell her?

42:24.291 --> 42:25.834
That we need counseling.

42:28.003 --> 42:31.131
And she's agreed to see us
if you'll agree to go.

42:40.182 --> 42:41.141
What's up, stranger?

42:41.725 --> 42:43.394
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

42:45.020 --> 42:45.854
Where you been?

42:45.938 --> 42:48.190
I just… I needed time to cool off.

42:48.274 --> 42:50.276
You blow up and walk out
with no explanation,

42:50.359 --> 42:51.694
and <i>you</i> need time to cool off?

42:51.777 --> 42:53.988
If you need an explanation,
what are we even doing here?

42:54.071 --> 42:56.282
I'm just trying to figure out
what went wrong.

42:56.365 --> 42:59.034
There's nothing to figure out.
I <i>know</i> my boyfriend

42:59.118 --> 43:01.370
is still obsessed
with his kindergarten crush.

43:01.453 --> 43:02.454
I'm not.

43:07.167 --> 43:09.169
What went wrong is that I hurt you,

43:09.670 --> 43:11.422
and I upset you, and I'm sorry!

43:12.590 --> 43:13.465
Cool.

43:16.093 --> 43:17.219
I don't get an apology?

43:17.803 --> 43:19.471
-For what?
-You upset <i>me</i>.

43:19.555 --> 43:21.015
No, I didn't, Ty. May…

43:21.724 --> 43:24.768
Maybe the truth did, okay?
But I can't… I can't fix that.

43:24.852 --> 43:27.062
Then how are we supposed to fix this?

43:27.646 --> 43:30.065
-I thought we just did.
-By putting it all on me?

43:32.401 --> 43:34.403
You know, for someone
who's had it so easy,

43:34.486 --> 43:36.822
you sure know how
to make simple things difficult.

43:37.448 --> 43:38.365
Is that how you see me?

43:38.449 --> 43:41.368
Look, if you want hand-wringing
and soul-searching,

43:41.452 --> 43:42.911
I'm not your girl, okay?

43:43.912 --> 43:46.582
-How do you not know that by now?
-Just trying to talk this through.

43:46.665 --> 43:49.460
Until you get an apology,
when I didn't do anything wrong, Ty!

43:49.543 --> 43:51.378
Fine. It's not about right or wrong!

43:51.462 --> 43:53.964
It's about where we are
and where we're going in the future!

43:54.465 --> 43:57.551
Our relationship deserves
that kind of investment, doesn't it?

44:06.101 --> 44:07.728
You know, my mom says,

44:07.811 --> 44:11.065
"At some point, you gotta decide
whether you're spending more on repairs

44:11.148 --> 44:12.149
than the car's worth."

44:14.652 --> 44:15.694
See you, Ty.

44:28.374 --> 44:31.502
We officially have enough signatures

44:31.585 --> 44:37.174
to go forward with the recall
of Trent Lewis as mayor!

44:40.511 --> 44:43.514
Oh! We'll file all the petitions
first thing Monday morning.

44:43.597 --> 44:46.183
-Whoo!
-Might I say a few words?

44:46.266 --> 44:48.102
Starting with congratulations…

44:48.185 --> 44:49.395
-Mm-hmm.

44:49.478 --> 44:50.604
…and thanks.

44:51.313 --> 44:54.483
To you, ladies,
who have fought the good fight.

44:54.566 --> 44:59.488
This magical town is my whole world,

44:59.571 --> 45:04.743
and I have worked to keep it welcoming,
hopeful, and most of all kind.

45:04.827 --> 45:05.994
Oh nice.

45:06.704 --> 45:08.580
I'm thrilled and encouraged

45:08.664 --> 45:11.333
that our Sweet Magnolias
have taken up the standard

45:11.417 --> 45:16.380
and are ready to fight to make the town
whole and right once again!

45:16.463 --> 45:17.297
-Yes!
-Absolutely!

45:17.381 --> 45:20.175
-Those are <i>our</i> girls.
-Yeah.

45:22.636 --> 45:25.222
The next generation is in such good hands.

45:26.724 --> 45:29.852
You are raising them so wonderfully.

45:31.228 --> 45:34.148
Teaching them as we taught you.

45:35.441 --> 45:38.026
And it makes me so very happy.

45:38.110 --> 45:39.445
You bless us.

45:42.614 --> 45:44.783
Cheers to Serenity

45:44.867 --> 45:47.411
and all the women who make it so special.

45:48.620 --> 45:49.621
To Serenity.

45:58.213 --> 45:59.715
Oh! Frances!
