14:05.360 --> 14:06.560
What was that?

14:06.720 --> 14:08.800
It can’t be.

14:08.960 --> 14:10.960
The Supreme magic.

14:11.080 --> 14:13.000
Fight her.

14:22.840 --> 14:24.760
They’re fighting back!

14:24.920 --> 14:26.600
(BRIDGET)
It’s no use.

14:26.760 --> 14:29.560
You’re evenly matched,
it could go on forever.

14:29.720 --> 14:31.640
Literally, in this town.

14:31.800 --> 14:38.080

Do as I say.
Move the Founders to the beacon.

14:57.280 --> 14:59.080
(MAGICAL CRACKLING)

15:01.360 --> 15:02.720
She moved us.

15:02.880 --> 15:04.960
Why?
(CRACKLING)

15:05.080 --> 15:08.720
Take her out. Forget everything else.

15:08.880 --> 15:12.760
Just get rid of the girl.

15:12.920 --> 15:15.560

16:00.000 --> 16:01.360
What will?

16:01.560 --> 16:04.520
(AGATHA)
Hollowfall are exacting their revenge.

16:04.680 --> 16:06.880
The Founders are being swallowed.

16:08.320 --> 16:13.040
They’ll be treated with kindness, like me.
But no longer able to do any harm.

16:13.200 --> 16:14.800
No magic in Hollowfall.

16:15.880 --> 16:17.880
(THUNDER RUMBLES)
Sorsha. (GASPS)

16:18.000 --> 16:19.440

Sorsha?

16:47.520 --> 16:49.280
What did you sew?

16:49.440 --> 16:51.000
It’s love.

16:51.160 --> 16:54.440
She sewed love for us,
the Founders left our bodies,

16:54.640 --> 16:56.680
and were cast into the windows.

16:56.840 --> 16:57.840
Us?

17:03.440 --> 17:04.600
You did it.

17:05.960 --> 17:07.080

Shut up.

17:47.080 --> 17:50.760
-What happened?
-It’s true, I flew too close to the sun.

17:50.920 --> 17:54.320
But I solved the puzzle
so I ended up between worlds.

17:54.520 --> 17:57.280
I’ve been yelling at you this whole time,

17:57.440 --> 17:59.680
invisible, ignored.

Back to normal.

The bunker.

18:09.440 --> 18:11.040
Tara.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.840
When Bella and I got together,

18:17.000 --> 18:21.560
all the things we talked about,
that was really all you?

18:22.960 --> 18:25.760
(SIGHS)
Kook.

18:25.920 --> 18:27.360
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

18:31.040 --> 18:35.160
Cam, we can't. The tree curse.

18:41.000 --> 18:46.440
Tara. You’re the Supreme Everine now.
The curse can not affect you.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.800
Tara found the key.
The bog’s cleared. Come out now.

Seb, you have no idea
what we’ve been through. Really.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.520
Out of my way!

19:12.560 --> 19:14.920
I’m mayor of this town.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.600
I’m a fool. I know.

19:26.760 --> 19:33.440
I let magic and science and hot spiders
get in the way of what was important...

19:34.560 --> 19:36.720
that we have a connection.

19:37.720 --> 19:39.720
A language all of our own.

To be with your mother.

undo this.
