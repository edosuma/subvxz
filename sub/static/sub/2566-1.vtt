Hello.
Hi. Seth?

00:06.675 --> 00:08.134
Yeah?
Hey, there, it's Doug.

00:08.218 --> 00:09.260
Um, I'm sorry.
Doug who?

00:10.637 --> 00:13.932
Doug Harris.
You know, Doug Harris.

00:14.516 --> 00:17.352
"Persian Rug Doug"?
"Chili Cheese Doug"?

00:17.977 --> 00:19.145
"SPF 60"?

00:19.229 --> 00:21.022
Oh, of course, man.

00:21.106 --> 00:22.857
SPF 60,
how are you, brother?

00:22.941 --> 00:24.317
It's been a long time.

00:24.401 --> 00:26.111
I, uh, know we haven't
spoken in a while

00:26.194 --> 00:28.363
but I was actually
calling because

00:28.446 --> 00:30.365
I've actually got
some really great news.

00:31.116 --> 00:34.411
I'm getting married, bud. Wow!
That's amazing. Congratulations.

00:34.494 --> 00:37.288
We're very excited and, in
fact, I'm doubly excited

00:37.372 --> 00:39.207
because I'm calling
to see if maybe

00:39.290 --> 00:41.918
you would want
to be my best man.

00:46.506 --> 00:48.717
<i>Wow. Um, I mean,
this is</i> a <i>little bit awkward.</i>

00:49.092 --> 00:51.594
I feel like
we're not at that level.

00:51.678 --> 00:53.998
It feels like we don't know
each other that well. You know?

00:54.013 --> 00:57.767
No, I don't feel that way.
What about that...

00:57.851 --> 01:00.395
Seth, what about that
weekend in Carlsbad Caverns?

01:00.478 --> 01:02.397
<i>I mean, that was
the 9th grade field trip.</i>

01:02.480 --> 01:03.606
The whole class went.

01:03.940 --> 01:05.108
Can I give you the dates?

01:05.191 --> 01:07.902
Maybe you just want to look into it.

01:07.986 --> 01:09.026
Are you still there, Seth?

01:09.112 --> 01:10.155
I don't know
what to say, Doug.

01:10.238 --> 01:11.656
<i>I mean, I didn't
invite you to my wedding.</i>

01:11.740 --> 01:14.492
That's okay. That's okay.

01:14.576 --> 01:17.036
Yeah, you can't invite
everyone that you want to.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.539
Actually, we did invite
everyone we wanted to.

01:19.622 --> 01:21.458
We had,
like, 400 guests.

01:21.708 --> 01:24.294
Freshman year?
Your roommate?

01:24.711 --> 01:26.880
<i>I heard you died.</i>

01:26.963 --> 01:30.967
No. No, that's Len Brophy.
I'm the other one.

01:31.050 --> 01:33.762
Truth be told, uh, you're the
first person I thought of.

01:33.845 --> 01:34.971
Is that a yes or a no?

01:35.054 --> 01:36.347

You have to know that. Okay.

03:46.644 --> 03:47.979
I ain't lying.

03:49.063 --> 03:52.859
Yeah. I've always been a bit
of a hopeless romantic myself.

03:53.151 --> 03:55.153
If our true match
exists somewhere,

03:55.236 --> 03:57.322
it's our goal in life
to find her.

03:57.655 --> 04:00.074
But, see, Andrew's a bit
more rational than me.

04:00.158 --> 04:02.577
Andrew always believed
that "the one"

04:02.660 --> 04:05.830
was a farce created
by musicians and Hollywood.

04:06.873 --> 04:08.166
Until last December.

04:08.333 --> 04:10.835
Andrew calls my cell phone
and he says,

04:10.919 --> 04:12.128
"Remember all that
stuff I said about"

04:12.211 --> 04:14.923
"there being no such
thing as 'the one'?"

04:15.048 --> 04:17.716
He said, "Well, I was wrong.
Her name is Gina Baker."

04:17.800 --> 04:19.093
"And she doesn't
know this yet,"

04:19.177 --> 04:20.678
"but she's going
to be my wife."

04:20.803 --> 04:21.803
Aw.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.681
And I knew at that moment

04:23.765 --> 04:25.224
that this Gina Baker

04:25.308 --> 04:27.018
was the luckiest girl
in the world.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.896
But after getting to know
you these past few days,

04:29.979 --> 04:32.482
and as I look at
you tonight, Gina,

04:32.565 --> 04:33.733
I know at this moment

04:33.816 --> 04:37.737
that Andrew is the
luckiest guy in the world.

04:37.820 --> 04:40.990
Because I know that you
both have found "the one."

04:41.157 --> 04:42.367
Aw.

04:43.868 --> 04:45.912
Ah. I said I'm not going to do it.

04:47.121 --> 04:49.123
I want to propose a toast.

04:50.625 --> 04:51.960
This is to the groom,

04:54.337 --> 04:55.713
my best friend,

04:57.048 --> 04:59.050
and his beautiful
new bride.

04:59.217 --> 05:00.927
This is to
"happily ever after."

05:01.010 --> 05:02.637
- I love you both.
- Cheers!

05:06.224 --> 05:08.142
- Congrats, man.
- Great speech.

05:08.226 --> 05:09.978
So, are you still
the hopeless romantic?

05:10.061 --> 05:11.854
Well, I wouldn't say
"hopeless."

05:15.066 --> 05:17.110
Hey, can I speak to you for a minute?
Like, two seconds.

05:17.193 --> 05:19.320
Yeah. Uh, I'll be
fightback, babe.

05:22.073 --> 05:23.574
I don't even
know what to say, man.

05:23.658 --> 05:25.868
Did you see their faces?
They were smiling.

05:25.952 --> 05:27.495
Hey, hey!

05:27.578 --> 05:29.455
Man, did you see the beautiful
titties on that girl back there?

05:29.580 --> 05:32.208
I'm trying to tag her ass before she
passes out, so if you could just...

05:32.291 --> 05:35.420
Yeah, sure. Um, your
wig's a little askew.

05:35.545 --> 05:38.006
That's fine. Thank you. Okay.
So, I guess that's it.

05:38.089 --> 05:39.757
You know the rules.
I do. I just thought that...

05:39.882 --> 05:42.260
Thought what? I thought we
maybe hit it off, right?

05:42.677 --> 05:44.762
No. We definitely didn't.
Oh.

05:44.929 --> 05:46.889
You're a great kid, but
unfortunately, a deal is a deal.

05:46.973 --> 05:48.266
There's no contact
after final payment.

05:48.349 --> 05:49.559
I should have
charged you more.

05:49.642 --> 05:51.352
I'm serious, man. You got
the real deal tonight.

05:51.436 --> 05:52.562
I was in the zone, baby.

05:52.645 --> 05:54.272
Yeah, great.
No, we don't do that.

05:54.439 --> 05:55.940
Sure.

09:33.741 --> 09:36.410
♪ Just say I do

09:40.748 --> 09:43.626
♪ Tell me right now, baby

09:43.751 --> 09:44.877
♪ I think I wanna marry

09:45.378 --> 09:48.506
So, Edmundo sent you
to come find the Oracle.

09:48.589 --> 09:49.632
What can I do for you?

09:49.674 --> 09:51.926
Hi. Yeah, I guess I do have
a few questions. Mmm-hmm.

09:52.843 --> 09:54.845
Um, what exactly
do you do?

09:55.221 --> 09:57.181
I provide best man
services for guys

09:57.265 --> 09:59.475
like yourself who
lack in such areas.

10:00.268 --> 10:01.769
So, I'm not alone?

10:01.852 --> 10:04.572
Alone? No. I run a very profitable
business because of guys like you.

10:04.689 --> 10:05.898
Here's a fun fact for you.

10:05.982 --> 10:07.400
A kid goes to
Cornell University.

10:07.483 --> 10:09.110
He obviously has way too
much time on his hands.

10:09.193 --> 10:10.611
He recently confirmed
the number

10:10.695 --> 10:12.321
of real friends
the average American has.

10:12.405 --> 10:13.572
That means we're
not talking about

10:13.656 --> 10:14.907
the phony
Facebook friends here.

10:14.991 --> 10:15.950
We're talking
about the friends

10:16.033 --> 10:17.201
who know where
your porn stash is.

10:17.285 --> 10:19.829
That number has dropped from
three to two since 1985.

10:20.162 --> 10:22.206
Really?
I don't have any.

10:22.290 --> 10:25.126
How many weddings do you think
were in the US last year?

10:25.334 --> 10:26.794
Four hundred and fifty...

10:26.877 --> 10:29.130
2.4 million.
Four million.

10:29.213 --> 10:31.215
That means there were
2.4 million grooms.

10:31.382 --> 10:33.009
Do you think that each and
every single one of them

10:33.092 --> 10:34.802
has somebody
to be their best man?

10:34.885 --> 10:36.971
Wow. I never knew
people like you existed.

10:37.054 --> 10:38.054
I'm like an angel.

10:38.139 --> 10:39.390
I'm only there when you need me to be.

10:39.515 --> 10:41.767
Excuse me. You got to
get going, Jimmy.

10:41.851 --> 10:43.769
Beth Shalom, right?
Beth Yirmeyahu.

10:43.853 --> 10:44.937
I don't understand
why they do these things

10:45.021 --> 10:46.581
in the middle of traffic.
It's annoying.

10:46.647 --> 10:48.357
So, what did you
tell your fiancée?

10:48.441 --> 10:50.484
I, uh, told her that
I have a best man lined up.

10:50.609 --> 10:52.945
You gave her the old Norton Winchell, huh?
I did what now?

10:53.070 --> 10:54.905
The Norton Winchell. It's
the imaginary-friend covet

10:54.989 --> 10:56.469
It's an amateur move,
but it's common.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.010
What about your parents?
They in on it?

10:58.075 --> 10:59.243
Oh, you don't have to
worry about them.

10:59.327 --> 11:00.828
Why, they protesting
the marriage?

11:00.911 --> 11:03.247
No, they passed away several years ago.
That's perfect.

11:03.748 --> 11:05.082
Is this a large wedding
or a small wedding?

11:05.166 --> 11:06.208
Large.

11:06.292 --> 11:07.793
Social or family?
Social.

11:07.877 --> 11:09.337
Hancock Park,
Bel Air, Palisades?

11:09.420 --> 11:10.880
Downtown,
Millennium Biltmore.

11:10.963 --> 11:12.506
All right. Let's go
over some of my packages.

11:12.590 --> 11:14.550
If you're looking for
a basic Single Wing Ringman,

11:14.592 --> 11:15.634
that's where
I'm your best man,

11:15.718 --> 11:16.927
I attend your wedding
for the full day.

11:17.053 --> 11:18.429
Okay. If you need something
a little more involved,

11:18.512 --> 11:20.431
where I participate in all the
festivities for the weekend,

11:20.514 --> 11:22.350
then you're talking
about a Bronze Bow Tie.

11:22.433 --> 11:23.713
Now, if you've got
real problems,

11:23.768 --> 11:25.061
what you need
is a Silver Cuff Link.

11:25.144 --> 11:26.687
Now, that includes everything
in the Bronze Bow Tie

11:26.771 --> 11:27.855
plus an additional
three groomsmen

11:27.938 --> 11:29.138
to balance out
the bridesmaids.

11:29.148 --> 11:30.524
For an extra
thousand dollars,

11:30.608 --> 11:31.942
I'll throw you a bachelor
party to your liking.

11:32.193 --> 11:33.903
How are you looking on groomsmen?
Not good at all.

11:33.986 --> 11:35.988
Not good as in
you need one or two?

11:36.072 --> 11:37.406
I need seven.

11:37.740 --> 11:40.534
You need seven groomsmen?
I do.

11:40.618 --> 11:42.870
Do you have any idea
what you're asking for?

11:42.953 --> 11:44.955
You're asking me to
pull off a Golden Tux.

11:45.081 --> 11:46.874
Yeah. See, I don't see that
on this pamphlet here.

11:46.957 --> 11:48.125
It's not on the pamphlet.

11:48.209 --> 11:49.489
Because what you're
talking about

11:49.502 --> 11:50.961
is what we joke
about around here.

11:51.045 --> 11:53.881
That's a laugh. "Hey, we should
try to do a Golden Tux."

11:55.007 --> 11:56.675
Too many moving parts.
Too many things can go wrong.

11:56.801 --> 11:57.885
No. But there's a name for it.

11:57.968 --> 11:59.637
There's also a name for a horse
with a horn on its head.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.472
It's called a unicorn. It
doesn't mean I can get you one.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.599
She will leave me.
I need your help.

12:03.682 --> 12:05.559
You're talking about
unchartered territory.

12:05.643 --> 12:07.853
No one's ever asked me
to pull off a Golden Tux.

12:07.937 --> 12:09.605
And in less
than two weeks?

12:09.688 --> 12:12.650
I have a nice job,
I have a real nice business.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.026
I don't need this
kind of pressure, man.

12:14.110 --> 12:16.779
I don't care how much it costs.
I need a Golden Tux!

12:21.158 --> 12:22.701
Are you sure
she's worth it?

12:22.910 --> 12:25.913
A guy like me doesn't
land a girl like her.

12:25.996 --> 12:28.207
So, I lied about having
a bunch of friends.

12:28.290 --> 12:30.084
I thought it would
make me look cool.

12:30.209 --> 12:31.794
Never did I think
she would like me,

12:31.877 --> 12:33.421
let alone agree
to marry me.

12:33.587 --> 12:36.215
I am marrying a girl
who, all my life,

12:36.298 --> 12:38.217
I never would have thought
would have looked at me twice.

12:38.300 --> 12:39.885
And I am marrying her.

12:41.178 --> 12:43.764
What's a little white lie
in the face of that?

12:45.433 --> 12:48.811
Please help me. I don't
know what else to do.

12:50.855 --> 12:52.440
I love this girl.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.028
I'm late.
Come on, get in the car.

12:58.112 --> 12:59.196
Really?

12:59.321 --> 13:00.990
Yeah.
Should I follow you...

13:01.073 --> 13:02.116
No, get in my car.
Come on.

13:02.199 --> 13:03.200
And you'll drop
me off back here...

13:03.242 --> 13:04.785
Will you just get in the
damn car, please? Okay.

13:04.869 --> 13:06.954
I'm late, man.
God damn it.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.497
Fucking white people.

13:10.708 --> 13:12.668
Now, at this time,
I would like to bring up

13:12.918 --> 13:15.963
Stuart's best friend
to say a few words.

13:25.473 --> 13:26.724
Just five short years ago,

13:26.807 --> 13:28.767
when I spoke at
Stuart's wedding,

13:29.059 --> 13:30.561
I never expected

13:30.644 --> 13:32.438
to be speaking
at his funeral so soon.

13:33.939 --> 13:35.524
As the only Ethiopian Jew

13:35.608 --> 13:37.943
at A.J. Wilson High School,

13:38.027 --> 13:39.695
I was bullied quite often.

13:40.029 --> 13:42.531
I remember one time when
these kids took my lunch

13:42.615 --> 13:43.949
and spilled it
all over my lap.

13:45.075 --> 13:46.395
After they did it,
they started to

13:46.452 --> 13:48.078
call me mean names.

13:48.245 --> 13:50.581
Some of them even
called me Pupil Jew-Jew.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.833
Because they said when they turned
the lights out in the hallway,

13:52.917 --> 13:54.168
all they could see
was my eye pupils.

13:54.251 --> 13:55.920
"Pupil Jew-Jew."

13:56.045 --> 13:57.671
"Here comes Pupil Jew-Jew."

13:57.922 --> 13:59.131
Some of them
even did awful

13:59.215 --> 14:01.509
Sammy Davis Jr.
Impressions to my face.

14:01.967 --> 14:04.845
"Sha boing boing,
you black Jew-Jew."

14:05.137 --> 14:06.847
I was covered
in sloppy Joe

14:06.931 --> 14:08.599
and mashed potatoes
and vegetable medley.

14:09.058 --> 14:11.101
And, uh, I look up,

14:13.479 --> 14:15.272
and I see Stu.

14:15.356 --> 14:18.943
He was standing there
with a handful of napkins.

14:19.318 --> 14:21.028
And a smile on his face

14:21.111 --> 14:23.280
as if to say, "Everything
was going to be okay."

14:23.614 --> 14:26.283
Stuart may have gone to that
big Shabbat in the sky,

14:26.367 --> 14:27.660
but he's still with us.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.871
He's up there
making sad angels laugh

14:30.955 --> 14:32.998
and he's giving
hopeless angels hope.

14:33.082 --> 14:34.583
And he's giving
small, little, black,

14:34.667 --> 14:36.835
Jewish angels with
a face full of corn

14:37.211 --> 14:40.381
a handful of napkins
and a smile

14:40.464 --> 14:42.633
that says everything
is going to be okay.

14:50.683 --> 14:52.226
I am so, so sorry.

14:52.309 --> 14:53.978
I mean, I had no idea.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.396
This could have
easily waited.

14:55.479 --> 14:56.480
Man, don't worry
about it.

14:56.605 --> 14:59.608
All those things that you said about
him, those incredible things.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.819
He really sounds like a great guy.
Who, Reinsdorf?

15:01.902 --> 15:03.279
Reinsdorf was
a piece of shit.

15:03.362 --> 15:05.197
If I end up doing
a Golden Tux for you,

15:05.281 --> 15:07.361
I'll say nice
things at your funeral, too.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.800
Shit, for another
100 bucks, I'll throw in

15:11.829 --> 15:13.372
holiday cards,
birthday calls,

15:13.455 --> 15:15.249
and if you croak within seven
years of said wedding...

15:15.332 --> 15:16.417
You're serious?

15:16.500 --> 15:17.543
Serious as paint.

15:17.626 --> 15:18.877
If I do this,
you need to understand

15:18.961 --> 15:20.421
this is strictly
a business relationship.

15:20.504 --> 15:21.839
Right. You're not
buying a new friend.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.340
You're hiring a best man.
Got it.

15:23.465 --> 15:24.883
Clients sometimes
blur that line.

15:24.967 --> 15:25.926
I'm not looking
for a friend.

15:26.010 --> 15:27.130
I am looking for a best man.

15:27.678 --> 15:28.846
50 grand.
Done.

15:28.929 --> 15:29.972
Plus expenses.
You got it.

15:30.055 --> 15:31.557
Who's officiating?
Father O'Brien.

15:31.682 --> 15:33.350
I never heard of him.
Her family's priest.

15:33.684 --> 15:35.477
What's my name?
Jimmy.

15:35.561 --> 15:37.938
No, my name. I'm assuming you made
up a name for me. What is it?

15:38.022 --> 15:39.189
Oh, I thought it was
a trick question.

15:39.273 --> 15:40.816
It's Bic. Bic Mitchum.

15:41.525 --> 15:43.277
Do I wear a fucking cape?
Bic Mitchum?

15:43.360 --> 15:44.486
It was an act
of desperation.

15:44.570 --> 15:45.946
Bic. Hey, ladies,
what's going on?

15:46.030 --> 15:47.781
My name is Bic and I got the dick.

15:47.865 --> 15:49.366
What's happening right now?
I'm Bic Mitchum.

15:49.450 --> 15:50.743
Hey, you put that down

15:50.826 --> 15:52.119
and if someone
asks you who said it,

15:52.202 --> 15:53.621
you tell them
Bic Mitchum said it.

15:53.704 --> 15:55.497
What do you mean that
there's no more candy?

15:55.581 --> 15:57.541
I'm Bic Mitchum
and I love candy.

15:57.833 --> 16:00.419
I'm Bic. Where's the pussy at?
What?

16:00.502 --> 16:01.670
Fuck you!
Wait.

16:01.754 --> 16:03.839
Fuck you, man!
No, Bic can't have these...

16:03.922 --> 16:06.300
Bic Mitchum can have
whatever the fuck he wants!

16:06.675 --> 16:08.510
Bic, Bic, Bic.

16:08.594 --> 16:10.429
All right. I like it.

16:10.763 --> 16:12.056
Doug Harris,
congratulations.

16:12.139 --> 16:13.390
Allow me
to introduce myself.

16:13.474 --> 16:14.767
My name is Bic Mitchum.

16:14.850 --> 16:15.976
I'm your new best man.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.312
It's great to
finally meet you.

16:18.395 --> 16:19.647
No, that's bullshit, Doug.

16:19.730 --> 16:21.398
"It's great to
see you again, man."

16:23.359 --> 16:24.568
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

16:24.652 --> 16:25.819
Yo, what are you
doing, man?

16:25.903 --> 16:28.113
Yo, what the fuck are you doing?
What are you doing?

16:28.197 --> 16:30.449
I'm sorry.
I just got really excited.

16:30.532 --> 16:32.159
God damn it, man.

16:32.451 --> 16:33.494
What do we do now?

16:33.577 --> 16:35.120
You go get some rest.

16:35.204 --> 16:36.330
Take care of them bags
under your eyes.

16:36.413 --> 16:37.623
Stop hugging strangers.

16:37.790 --> 16:39.958
God created the world
in seven days.

16:40.042 --> 16:41.922
I got to do a whole lot
more in a lot less time.

16:42.086 --> 16:44.296
I got to go find you
some damn friends.

16:44.421 --> 16:46.006
Just keep your eye on the
ball, you little fucker.

16:46.090 --> 16:47.591
And you're sure I'll get laid?
Yes.

16:47.675 --> 16:48.842
Because I haven't gotten
any since I got out.

16:48.926 --> 16:51.261
You'll crush ass. Seven bridesmaids.
Biltmore.

16:51.345 --> 16:54.181
Seven? I want seven vaginas up on my face.
Do you guarantee that?

16:54.264 --> 16:56.767
I can't guarantee that, but I'm
quite sure that they will want you.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.144
It's you!
Look at you. Come on.

16:59.228 --> 17:00.521
My mom isn't
paying you to talk

17:00.604 --> 17:01.772
to your loser friends.

17:01.855 --> 17:02.898
Loser?

17:03.899 --> 17:05.067
Oh!

17:05.275 --> 17:06.318
Don't talk to
Jimmy like that.

17:06.402 --> 17:07.778
Hey, what are you
doing, Fitz?

17:07.861 --> 17:10.196
I'll murder your family!
Turn it off.

17:10.698 --> 17:13.367
Brentwood? Biltmore.
Hal Lane Orchestra.

17:13.492 --> 17:16.412
Oh, man. Hal Lane is the best.
I know.

17:16.494 --> 17:18.539
Hurry up and finish the van.
I'm hungry.

17:18.622 --> 17:19.665
Okay, I'll be right there.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.541
Look, Jimmy,
I'd love to help you out,

17:21.625 --> 17:23.292
but I promised Marci
I'd get out of the game.

17:23.377 --> 17:24.586
Her old man hooked
me up with this job.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.380
Job? What job?
Washing the damn van?

17:26.463 --> 17:28.173
I'm an apprentice.
I just take care of the van

17:28.257 --> 17:29.925
while I learn to plumb.

17:30.008 --> 17:32.219
Stop. You look at me now and tell
me that you don't want back in.

17:32.302 --> 17:34.179
Where the heck did
you put the salad dressing,

17:34.263 --> 17:35.764
you fat idiot?

17:37.057 --> 17:40.310
Yeah, arms up. All right,
turn around, girl.

17:40.394 --> 17:42.646
Damn. You're trying
to smuggle

17:42.730 --> 17:44.148
some extra ass on the
flight, aren't you?

17:44.231 --> 17:45.232
Isn't that what
you're doing?

17:45.315 --> 17:46.525
Go on, girl.
You're good.

17:46.608 --> 17:47.943
Have a nice flight.
Ooh!

17:48.110 --> 17:49.987
Come on, man. You're
better than this, Reggie.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.447
Who's catering this gig?
Puck.

17:51.488 --> 17:53.907
Wolfgang? No, Hockey Puck, idiot.
'Yes, Wolfgang.

17:54.032 --> 17:55.659
The only thing they've got
in this place is Cinnabon.

17:55.993 --> 17:57.911
I've been eating
Cinnabon for breakfast,

17:57.995 --> 18:00.164
lunch, and dinner
for the past six months.

18:00.330 --> 18:01.999
Reggie, I don't need...
Okay? Of course I'm in.

18:02.082 --> 18:03.202
That's all I needed to know.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.251
Come on. We've a lot
of work to do.

18:04.334 --> 18:05.502
Now?
Yes, now.

18:05.586 --> 18:07.838
Hey, I'm clocking out.
I'm back in the game, baby.

18:08.046 --> 18:09.966
At least Edmundo
was able to reschedule

18:10.048 --> 18:12.384
the new salad dressing
tasting to tomorrow.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.261
There's only a week left

18:14.344 --> 18:15.846
and we still have
so much to do.

18:17.014 --> 18:18.098
Doug, what are you doing?

18:18.182 --> 18:20.517
I thought maybe we'd have
a little ice cream

18:21.518 --> 18:23.562
and then perhaps
some dessert.

18:23.812 --> 18:25.856
Oh, that is so not fair.
You know I'm trying

18:25.939 --> 18:27.733
to lose 4.2 pounds
before the wedding.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.777
Well, I think you look beautiful
just the way you are.

18:29.860 --> 18:31.111
And I got you something else.

18:31.195 --> 18:32.321
What?

18:33.864 --> 18:34.907
Ta-da.

18:34.990 --> 18:35.991
Oh, my God.

18:36.074 --> 18:37.993
I remember when we watched
Girl with a Pearl Earring,

18:38.076 --> 18:39.328
and you said
how pretty you thought

18:39.411 --> 18:40.621
the girl's pearl earring was.

18:40.704 --> 18:41.984
So, I went out
and had it remade.

18:42.039 --> 18:43.373
You know, as a pair.

18:43.457 --> 18:45.375
Oh, my God.
You are so sweet.

18:45.459 --> 18:47.169
That was so unnecessary.

18:48.712 --> 18:50.255
Is that Boyz ll Men?

18:50.506 --> 18:53.717
You know, I was thinking

18:53.801 --> 18:56.094
of a way to alleviate

18:56.386 --> 18:58.305
all that stress
you've been feeling.

18:58.472 --> 18:59.598
That is not fair.

18:59.681 --> 19:01.225
Remember, we said no teasing
each other. Mmm-mmm.

19:01.433 --> 19:03.477
I know we agreed to
the whole "no making love"

19:03.560 --> 19:04.978
"for the last month" rule.

19:05.062 --> 19:06.188
That's a lot of quotes.

19:06.271 --> 19:08.482
Yeah, but maybe
I could request

19:08.565 --> 19:10.442
a temporary stay of the ban.

19:10.526 --> 19:13.529
No. Honey, look,
I would love to, okay?

19:13.695 --> 19:15.656
But the article says
this will enhance

19:15.739 --> 19:17.533
our emotional reunification.

19:17.616 --> 19:20.369
I know. Maybe we could
take one night off.

19:20.744 --> 19:22.663
Can we do that, maybe?

19:22.746 --> 19:24.373
Just for one night.

19:24.456 --> 19:25.999
To just have sex?

19:26.166 --> 19:28.210
Honey, you know this is
difficult for me, too, okay?

19:28.293 --> 19:30.838
But I am willing to make
the necessary sacrifice

19:30.921 --> 19:33.632
to make sure that our
wedding night is perfect.

19:34.383 --> 19:36.552
Doug and I met
at Camp Wampacheempi.

19:36.969 --> 19:40.639
We were both 12, and we used
to sneak out together at night

19:40.722 --> 19:42.724
and hunt bullfrogs and...

19:43.100 --> 19:44.685
I'm sorry.
I dropped a line.

19:44.768 --> 19:46.144
I know I keep
tripping over it.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.348
You know what?
You nailed it.

19:47.396 --> 19:49.064
What about the distractions?
Do you have any party tricks?

19:49.147 --> 19:50.482
Party tricks. Yeah, okay.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.276
Oh!

19:54.069 --> 19:55.279
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.

19:56.280 --> 19:58.031
So, that's kind of it.

19:58.115 --> 19:59.867
I just need a wall.
No, no, no!

19:59.992 --> 20:01.994
No, don't, please.

20:03.704 --> 20:05.706
I got it. There it goes.

20:06.790 --> 20:07.791
Bronstein.

20:10.002 --> 20:11.962
Um, I prepared
the scene from Titanic

20:12.045 --> 20:13.463
where Jack
tries to save Rose...

20:13.547 --> 20:16.800
Stop. We specifically asked for monologues.
We don't want any scenes.

20:16.884 --> 20:18.176
Right, but I thought
that this would...

20:18.260 --> 20:19.303
It said monologue.

20:19.469 --> 20:21.069
This would showcase my talent.
Thank you.

20:21.471 --> 20:23.098
I could read
the part of Rose.

20:24.558 --> 20:26.518
My name is Kip Loyola.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.520
I'm 6'4".

20:28.812 --> 20:29.938
You don't have to...

20:30.022 --> 20:31.148
6'3".

20:31.815 --> 20:34.484
As you can see by my
résumé, I've done tons

20:34.651 --> 20:37.404
of soap operas.

20:38.322 --> 20:40.157
Well, uh, did you
prepare anything?

20:43.076 --> 20:45.454
On! Shit, baby!

20:45.537 --> 20:47.039
All right.
Did you, uh...

20:47.122 --> 20:48.332
Is that, uh...

20:49.333 --> 20:50.876
Do you have
a distraction

20:50.959 --> 20:53.295
or a party trick
that ties in with this?

20:56.715 --> 20:57.925
Uh...

20:58.091 --> 20:59.343
Okay, I guess.

20:59.509 --> 21:01.345
That's your...

21:01.511 --> 21:02.721
Hey, this is bullshit, Jimmy.

21:02.804 --> 21:04.556
You promised me
a spot on the team.

21:04.640 --> 21:05.880
Hey, look, O,
it's not like this

21:05.891 --> 21:07.225
is a Single Wing
Ringman thing.

21:07.309 --> 21:08.268
I told you
I need you to drive.

21:08.352 --> 21:09.770
I'm sick of driving.
I want in.

21:09.853 --> 21:11.104
You can't have in
because you don't

21:11.188 --> 21:12.439
have a party trick
distraction, do you?

21:12.522 --> 21:14.274
I told you I've been working on
the talking backwards thing.

21:14.358 --> 21:15.609
Well, no offense, O,
but you've been

21:15.692 --> 21:17.027
saying the same thing
for three months.

21:17.110 --> 21:18.278
Months three
for that saying been

21:18.362 --> 21:20.530
you've but O
offense no well yeah.

21:20.614 --> 21:21.854
That's pretty
fucking cool.

21:21.949 --> 21:23.909
- Cool fucking pretty that's.
- Whoa!

21:23.992 --> 21:25.285
How much wood
could a woodchuck chuck

21:25.369 --> 21:26.609
if a woodchuck
could chuck wood?

21:26.703 --> 21:27.704
No.

21:29.706 --> 21:31.541
Wood chuck could
chuck wood a if chuck

21:31.625 --> 21:33.418
chuck wood a could
wood much how.

21:33.669 --> 21:34.711
Oh!

21:35.963 --> 21:37.130
Okay, that'll do.

21:37.214 --> 21:38.340
Do that'll okay.

21:38.799 --> 21:40.133
Put a sock in it.
We're done.

21:40.217 --> 21:41.385
Sock on put.

21:43.762 --> 21:46.431
Try the Roquefort
Buttermilk.

21:48.767 --> 21:50.227
Is it too tangy?

21:50.310 --> 21:52.062
Uh, maybe a little.
A little?

21:52.145 --> 21:54.481
Do you have something, maybe, a little
less harsh? 'Cause he's like...

21:54.564 --> 21:57.025
I can offer you
the Algonquin Ranch.

21:57.109 --> 21:58.235
Okay, give me one second.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.904
Ray. A.R., ASAP.

22:01.029 --> 22:04.449
Okay, honey, we're all set tomorrow.
Brunch at my parents' house.

22:04.533 --> 22:07.744
Oh, yeah. Oh, sweetie,
I thought I told you that

22:08.036 --> 22:11.039
I got to, uh, hit the office
tomorrow. I'm sorry.

22:11.123 --> 22:13.626
Oh, no, no. Edmundo's bringing
some more appetizer samples.

22:13.709 --> 22:15.919
You know I can't make
a decision without you.

22:17.254 --> 22:19.798
Damn it. I was going to keep
this a surprise, but...

22:19.881 --> 22:22.175
What? Bic is flying
in tomorrow morning.

22:22.259 --> 22:23.510
Bic? The Bic?

22:23.593 --> 22:24.803
Yeah. I have to go pick
him up from the airport.

22:24.886 --> 22:26.138
You aren't kidding!
Oh, I'm so excited!

22:26.221 --> 22:27.421
I wanted to keep
it a surprise.

22:27.472 --> 22:29.433
This is so great.
Bring him to lunch with you.

22:29.516 --> 22:32.477
No! No. No, I can't.
Why are you yelling?

22:32.561 --> 22:34.604
I'm sorry. I just, uh...

22:34.688 --> 22:36.273
I can't do that
because, um,

22:36.356 --> 22:38.191
we have so much
catching up to do.

22:38.275 --> 22:39.443
Oh, come on. Bring Bic.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.486
I want him to help us decide
on all these fun things.

22:41.570 --> 22:44.531
No, I don't know that that's...
He can't...

22:44.614 --> 22:45.991
Listen to me.
He is your best man

22:46.074 --> 22:47.325
and I have
never met him, okay?

22:47.451 --> 22:49.119
You cannot tell me
he's flying in and not

22:49.202 --> 22:51.246
bring him to lunch tomorrow.
Are you crazy?

22:51.496 --> 22:52.581
Okay.

22:52.706 --> 22:55.792
No! Take my hand.
I'll pull you in.

22:56.126 --> 22:59.504
<i>Stay where you are.
I mean it. I'll let go.</i>

22:59.588 --> 23:00.589
Oh.

23:07.220 --> 23:09.723
♪ Near, far... ♪

23:09.890 --> 23:12.559
Hey. Doug's on line one.
Something's wrong.

23:13.393 --> 23:14.603
What's going on, Tonto?

23:14.686 --> 23:16.938
Hey, there.
We've got a bit of a problem.

23:18.315 --> 23:20.317
What the hell were you thinking?
She cornered me.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.444
Doug, in the future, if
somebody asks you something

23:22.569 --> 23:24.780
that boxes you in, you boomerang it.
"Boomerang"?

23:24.863 --> 23:27.074
You respond with either a
compliment or a question.

23:27.157 --> 23:28.950
Compliments are for women.
Questions are for men.

23:29.034 --> 23:30.452
If I were to ask you
something about Bic

23:30.535 --> 23:31.578
that you and I
haven't discussed,

23:31.661 --> 23:32.661
what would you say, Doug?

23:32.704 --> 23:36.166
You're, um, very handsome.
Thank you, Doug.

23:36.583 --> 23:37.918
That's a compliment.

23:38.001 --> 23:40.587
Compliments are for women,
questions are for men.

23:40.670 --> 23:41.797
You throw out random words.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.423
You're confusing me
a lot right now.

23:43.507 --> 23:44.758
You use random words
that will distract them

23:44.841 --> 23:45.926
from the original question.

23:46.009 --> 23:47.052
Random words.

23:47.135 --> 23:49.054
We have 18 hours to prepare for
this brunch with the Palmers.

23:49.137 --> 23:51.598
Which means we have 18 hours
for a Shotgun Intro.

23:51.681 --> 23:52.681
Let's get to work.

23:52.724 --> 23:53.850
You want to start off
with the HW2's.

23:53.934 --> 23:55.644
Right.
The how-where-whats.

23:55.727 --> 23:56.853
These are the three
basic questions

23:56.937 --> 23:58.688
that everyone I encounter
as Bic are going to ask.

23:58.772 --> 24:01.191
How did we meet? Where am I from?
What do I do?

24:01.358 --> 24:03.819
If we know nothing else,
we can tread enough water

24:03.902 --> 24:06.279
to fake a stomach cramp and run away.
How did we meet?

24:06.363 --> 24:08.615
Uh, freshman year,
Stanford.

24:08.698 --> 24:10.575
That means I'm smart.
Shit. Where am I from?

24:10.659 --> 24:12.369
I never said.
North Dakota.

24:12.494 --> 24:14.371
Why North Dakota? Do you know
anybody in North Dakota?

24:14.454 --> 24:16.164
No.
Nobody does. What do I do?

24:16.289 --> 24:18.416
You're in the military. That a boy.
See, now you're thinking.

24:18.500 --> 24:19.918
No address, no phone number.

24:20.001 --> 24:21.711
And chicks dig
the uniform shit.

24:21.795 --> 24:23.296
It's going to be like
shooting fish in a barrel.

24:23.380 --> 24:25.298
Actually, I, uh, don't
think you're going to be

24:25.382 --> 24:27.134
shooting any fish
in this particular barrel.

24:27.217 --> 24:28.417
An Army guy
that's the best man

24:28.468 --> 24:29.668
not hitting on
the bridesmaids?

24:29.719 --> 24:30.971
They'll think
I'm a homosexual.

24:31.054 --> 24:32.222
Well, uh, actually...

24:32.305 --> 24:34.432
Well, actually, what? You told
them I'm a homosexual, Doug?

24:34.516 --> 24:36.476
No. No, not that,
per se.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.186
What, per se, Doug?
Tell me.

24:38.436 --> 24:41.106
Bic Mitchum is actually
Father Bic Mitchum.

24:41.273 --> 24:42.774
You told them
I'm a fucking priest, Doug?

24:42.858 --> 24:45.026
Well, actually, it was
Gretchen who said it.

24:45.110 --> 24:46.695
You told Gretchen
I'm a fucking priest, Doug?

24:46.778 --> 24:47.946
No. Gretchen said...

24:48.029 --> 24:49.322
There was nothing else
that popped into your head?

24:49.406 --> 24:50.991
At the time I thought it
was a really smart idea.

24:51.074 --> 24:52.074
A fucking priest?

24:52.117 --> 24:54.911
But now I can see it's going to upset you.
A fucking priest?

24:55.036 --> 24:58.915
Fuck! Fuck, shit, bitch, dick, ass!
No. No, you can't.

24:58.999 --> 25:00.625
Oh, well, I have to
get them all out now

25:00.709 --> 25:02.169
because I'm a fucking
priest and I can't

25:02.252 --> 25:03.920
cuss around
your family, Doug. Fuck!

25:04.045 --> 25:06.006
Oh, come on.
That's the last one.

25:08.091 --> 25:09.968
Jill Abromowitz,
freshman year.

25:10.093 --> 25:12.053
Far-sighted or near-sighted'?
Far-sighted.

25:12.220 --> 25:14.764
Okay. Wait, let me finish.
And near-sighted.

25:15.974 --> 25:17.350
Do you supinate or pronate?
What?

25:17.475 --> 25:19.603
Does your foot roll inward or outward?
Outward.

25:19.769 --> 25:21.188
Okay, that explains
the weight gain.

25:22.147 --> 25:24.232
Pepsi or Coke?
Sunset, full moon?

25:24.316 --> 25:26.026
If you could pick your favorite
superhero, who would it be?

25:26.109 --> 25:27.235
Is Pas-Man a superhero?

25:27.319 --> 25:28.403
No, he's not, Doug.

25:28.570 --> 25:30.864
Stairs or elevators?
Never mind. Forget it.

25:30.947 --> 25:32.908
Okay, Doug, I'm almost happy right now.
What's my name?

25:32.991 --> 25:34.711
That would be Bic Mitchum.
Where am I from?

25:34.784 --> 25:35.869
You're from North Dakota.

25:35.952 --> 25:37.037
Ask me why you're
from North Dakota.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.330
Tell me why I'm
from North Dakota.

25:38.413 --> 25:40.707
Because who the fuck knows
anybody from North Dakota?

25:40.790 --> 25:42.292
I want to hear my name again.
What's my name?

25:42.375 --> 25:44.502
Oh, you are motherfucking Bic Mitchum!
Rhythm.

25:44.586 --> 25:45.962
Motherfucking
Bic Mitchum.

25:46.046 --> 25:48.798
Motherfucking Bic Mitchum.
Motherfucking...

25:49.049 --> 25:50.050
What are your phobias?

25:50.133 --> 25:51.468
Uh, I fear raccoons.

25:51.551 --> 25:52.636
Favorite sport, Doug?

25:52.719 --> 25:55.347
Baseball. And I love
women's basketball.

25:56.348 --> 25:58.892
Come on, we're getting
too tired. Up. Yes.

26:01.019 --> 26:02.187
Oh, shit.

26:04.898 --> 26:07.108
Doug! Doug!

26:07.317 --> 26:09.637
Get up. Get your ass up. We're
going to be late for brunch.

26:09.653 --> 26:10.695
Oh, shit!

26:11.196 --> 26:12.516
When you get
backed into a corner,

26:12.530 --> 26:14.530
remember your compliments,
boomerang, random words.

26:14.574 --> 26:15.575
Use random words.

26:15.659 --> 26:17.786
Specifically, which
random words should I use?

26:18.036 --> 26:21.164
Any random words. Just be yourself, Doug.
You'll be all right.

26:21.248 --> 26:22.749
What if they start
asking too many questions?

26:22.832 --> 26:24.709
I mean, you hardly
even know me.

26:24.793 --> 26:26.920
Except for the fact that you
prefer showers to baths,

26:27.003 --> 26:28.380
Pas-Man's your favorite
superhero even though

26:28.463 --> 26:29.798
Pas-Man's not
a superhero at all,

26:29.881 --> 26:31.967
you're far-sighted and you're
near-sighted, you supinate,

26:32.050 --> 26:34.594
you prefer full moons over sunsets,
you're afraid of raccoons,

26:34.678 --> 26:36.554
you love women's basketball,
you iron your boxers,

26:36.638 --> 26:37.639
finished third
on the bar exam,

26:37.722 --> 26:38.723
eat American,
but prefer cheddar,

26:38.807 --> 26:40.934
you're against the designated hitter,
believe in life after death,

26:41.017 --> 26:42.727
and you played the violin
until you were 19 years old.

26:42.811 --> 26:45.611
Which is the same year that you lost
your virginity to Jill Abromowitz.

26:45.772 --> 26:46.773
Let's go, man.

26:46.856 --> 26:47.857
That will work.

26:48.358 --> 26:51.027
You follow my lead. You
talk as little as you can.

26:51.111 --> 26:54.281
Short answers. You don't
initiate conversation. Wi-Wo.

26:54.531 --> 26:56.366
"Wi-Wo"?
We're in, we're out.

26:56.449 --> 26:57.826
Oh. Wi-WO.

26:57.909 --> 26:59.661
Wait, wait, wait.
What?

26:59.911 --> 27:01.746
I'm getting a little nauseous, man.
What?

27:01.871 --> 27:03.748
I think I'm in over my head, Doug.
No, no.

27:03.832 --> 27:05.709
This is a lot. You're talking
about a whole family.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.043
I've never done
a goddamn whole family.

27:07.127 --> 27:08.461
You're telling me
this now?

27:08.545 --> 27:09.713
What's your last name?

27:09.796 --> 27:10.922
Harris. Doug Harris.

27:11.006 --> 27:12.465
Oh, shit!
I thought it was Angley.

27:12.549 --> 27:14.134
What? Who's Angley?

27:14.217 --> 27:16.219
I have to go, buddy.
No!

27:16.303 --> 27:17.470
I'm fucking with you.

27:17.554 --> 27:18.972
Don't do that.
All right, relax.

27:19.055 --> 27:20.140
That was a really
shitty thing to do.

27:20.223 --> 27:22.392
Ring the bell, rookie.
Come on.

27:22.642 --> 27:24.144
You guys have to understand
that I come from

27:24.227 --> 27:25.729
a very dark past.

27:25.812 --> 27:27.314
And by dark,
of course I'm referring

27:27.397 --> 27:29.399
to my drug use.
I was on everything.

27:29.566 --> 27:32.068
At one point, the only good
vein I had was between my toes.

27:32.235 --> 27:34.863
Crystal meth. I'm not sure if any
of you guys can relate to it.

27:34.946 --> 27:36.281
Grandma,
I've seen your teeth.

27:36.364 --> 27:37.574
Maybe you can, or can't.

27:37.699 --> 27:41.036
But the Lord says, "Don't
judgeth upon what happens",

27:41.119 --> 27:43.413
"but what happens upon
what can't be judged."

27:43.496 --> 27:44.664
Which means, yes,

27:44.748 --> 27:46.041
I may have been to a point

27:46.124 --> 27:47.917
where I was sucking
dick for money.

27:48.084 --> 27:51.338
But that day when I woke up
face down in that snowbank,

27:51.504 --> 27:52.672
I didn't know where I was.

27:52.756 --> 27:54.632
I didn't even know
who I was.

27:54.799 --> 27:56.039
And I remember
squinting because

27:56.051 --> 27:57.552
I was being blinded
by this bright light.

27:57.635 --> 27:58.636
I couldn't see a thing.

27:58.720 --> 28:02.098
And when I finally opened
my eyes, I saw Jesus.

28:02.182 --> 28:03.475
You saw Jesus?

28:03.558 --> 28:04.809
Oh, I saw Jesus.

28:05.060 --> 28:08.146
He was in Mary's arms in the
nativity scene at St. Michael's.

28:08.688 --> 28:11.649
And I wept. But they
weren't tears of pain.

28:11.733 --> 28:12.901
These were tears of joy.

28:12.984 --> 28:14.778
From having found
my path, of course.

28:14.861 --> 28:16.154
So, Father...

28:16.237 --> 28:17.655
Call me Bic, please.

28:17.739 --> 28:20.367
What made you decide
to go into the military?

28:20.450 --> 28:22.160
Mmm.
That's a great question.

28:22.243 --> 28:24.537
Some people are called on
to serve God.

28:24.621 --> 28:26.206
Others are called
to serve our country.

28:26.456 --> 28:28.208
Those who are
chosen to serve both,

28:28.291 --> 28:29.709
they're called
Army chaplains.

28:30.085 --> 28:32.420
I got a two-way call
from the big fellow himself.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.548
A priest in the military.
Yeah.

28:35.632 --> 28:37.592
It's interesting.
Do they have a "don't ask",

28:37.675 --> 28:39.886
"don't tell" policy
on child molesting?

28:40.011 --> 28:41.096
Dad!

28:50.063 --> 28:51.898
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

28:51.981 --> 28:55.276
That's pretty good. I've never heard
that one. Now, that's a good one.

28:55.402 --> 28:56.528
Well, I try.

28:56.694 --> 28:58.071
Clever.
No, it wasn't.

28:58.154 --> 28:59.364
Somebody call the firemen

28:59.447 --> 29:01.366
because this is hot,
hot, hot! Okay?

29:01.491 --> 29:02.909
Do not touch.

29:04.119 --> 29:06.329
So, listen,
if you opt against

29:06.413 --> 29:07.997
the Russian
mushroom bisque,

29:08.081 --> 29:10.917
we can always go into
a more rustic theme

29:11.000 --> 29:12.710
with the Chilean chili.

29:13.044 --> 29:14.796
I'll be back
with the croutons.

29:14.963 --> 29:18.633
So, Bic, uh, where are
you from originally?

29:18.716 --> 29:20.343
Originally? North Dakota.

29:20.718 --> 29:22.929
Oh, no kidding. What town?
Henderson.

29:23.012 --> 29:24.639
I've never heard
of Henderson.

29:24.722 --> 29:26.224
Oh, Henderson's
a very small town, Ed.

29:26.307 --> 29:28.017
Oh, where is it
in relation to Bismarck?

29:29.769 --> 29:30.937
Are you familiar
with North Dakota?

29:31.020 --> 29:32.605
Ed's uncle has
a ranch up there.

29:32.772 --> 29:34.983
Wow! That is something
to know, there.

29:35.066 --> 29:37.277
Uh, no, it's actually on the
opposite side of Bismarck.

29:37.360 --> 29:39.487
You have Bismarck here,
but once you go around...

29:39.571 --> 29:41.114
You know the tunnel.
It's right there.

29:41.197 --> 29:42.490
Bismarck's in the middle.

29:42.615 --> 29:45.095
When you said "middle", all I saw
was Rita Hayworth.

29:45.201 --> 29:47.121
I mean, there's a striking
resemblance, isn't it?

29:47.162 --> 29:48.288
Oh, thank you, Father.

29:48.371 --> 29:49.539
No, there isn't.

29:49.914 --> 29:52.083
So, Doug,
when was the last time

29:52.167 --> 29:54.169
that you and Bic
saw each other?

29:56.212 --> 29:57.755
March.
March?

29:57.839 --> 29:58.965
Well, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

29:59.048 --> 30:01.288
Because, see, in March... April,
I was in the Middle East.

30:01.301 --> 30:03.803
Muffin juice. After that
is when I was training.

30:03.887 --> 30:04.929
Cottage cheese helmet.

30:05.054 --> 30:06.931
And from there is
when I was traveling,

30:07.015 --> 30:08.057
so you're talking
three, four...

30:08.183 --> 30:10.059
Three, four, six, seven months ago.
...six, seven years ago.

30:10.143 --> 30:11.144
Years ago.

30:11.227 --> 30:13.188
Honey, I thought you saw Bic at
the Vatican a couple years ago.

30:13.271 --> 30:14.272
Wait, what did you say?

30:14.355 --> 30:16.274
When you were in Rome,
you and Bic.

30:16.441 --> 30:18.943
Oh, boy, that's right.
Because you left in March.

30:19.027 --> 30:20.612
Red-hot pussy seltzer.

30:21.237 --> 30:22.697
Right? Right. Yeah.

30:22.780 --> 30:23.781
That sounds right.

30:23.865 --> 30:25.200
- What did you just say?
- Hmm?

30:25.283 --> 30:27.535
I think you said,
"Red-hot pussy seltzer."

30:27.619 --> 30:29.746
- Why would you say that?
Red-hot pussy seltzer?

30:30.788 --> 30:31.789
Honey?

30:32.415 --> 30:34.459
What's 34 times 12?
408.

30:35.376 --> 30:36.669
Shit, I didn't expect
an answer that quick.

30:36.753 --> 30:37.754
Breathe, Doug.

30:37.879 --> 30:39.589
Baby, what is going on with you?

30:39.756 --> 30:40.798
I, uh...

30:41.716 --> 30:42.759
I, um...

30:43.927 --> 30:45.678
I have to be
honest with you guys.

30:46.346 --> 30:47.514
Oh, my God!

30:49.849 --> 30:51.476
Honey?
Shit, that burns!

30:51.768 --> 30:54.270
Guys, that was so hot. I'm sorry, Doug.
It burns!

30:54.437 --> 30:55.605
Oh, God!

30:55.688 --> 30:57.368
Sorry. I didn't know
it was that hot, guys.

30:57.398 --> 30:58.858
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.

30:59.025 --> 31:00.860
- I'm on fire!
- Oh, my God!

31:01.027 --> 31:03.905
Shit! No! She's on fire!

31:04.948 --> 31:08.034
- It's an inferno!
- Holy shit!

31:10.411 --> 31:12.121
- I need liquids!
- Get back!

31:12.705 --> 31:14.707
- Oh, my God!
- Get something!

31:15.750 --> 31:17.377
It's making it worse!

31:18.836 --> 31:20.838
Give me the tablecloth!

31:20.922 --> 31:22.090
What is wrong with you?

31:22.173 --> 31:23.413
I'm going to get
something else!

31:23.466 --> 31:26.135
She just caught fire
so fast.

31:26.302 --> 31:30.181
Don't feel bad, Doug. She goes
through a can of Aqua Net a day.

31:30.682 --> 31:33.101
Hey, what did they say? Is she okay?
Is she going to be all right?

31:33.268 --> 31:36.229
Gretchen, how do you
like your grandma?

31:36.396 --> 31:39.482
What? I love her. You know that.
What happened?

31:39.566 --> 31:41.734
No, I mean, how do you like her?
Medium, well-done?

31:41.985 --> 31:42.985
Oh, my God, Dad.

31:43.027 --> 31:44.195
You can be
such an asshole.

31:44.279 --> 31:45.738
She has some minor burns

31:45.822 --> 31:47.574
to her head, chest,
back, neck, and breasts,

31:47.657 --> 31:49.337
but the doctor says
she's going to be fine.

31:49.367 --> 31:51.077
Oh, thank God. Come
on, let's go see her.

31:51.452 --> 31:53.371
I, uh...
I feel just awful.

31:53.538 --> 31:54.738
Well, shake it off.
If you knew

31:54.789 --> 31:56.082
what the old lady says
behind your back,

31:56.165 --> 31:57.542
you would have
done it on purpose.

31:57.625 --> 32:00.211
But let me say, that was a hell
of a tackle for a tenderfoot.

32:00.503 --> 32:04.090
Tenderfoot? Oh, Douglas was quite
the halfback back in college.

32:04.257 --> 32:06.426
You played football, Doug?
How come you never told me?

32:06.509 --> 32:08.428
I thought you were
just a nerd fan.

32:10.305 --> 32:13.183
Yeah. Yeah,
intramurals, scrimmage.

32:13.266 --> 32:14.976
We scrimmaged, the boys.

32:15.059 --> 32:18.354
And, you know, I made the all-campus
team a couple times in football.

32:18.479 --> 32:19.981
I was an all-conference
nose tackle.

32:20.064 --> 32:22.150
Half the team's
coming in for the wedding.

32:22.275 --> 32:24.902
Why don't we have a friendly
game of two-hand touch?

32:25.069 --> 32:26.946
You know, the old-timers
versus the groomsmen.

32:27.030 --> 32:28.031
What do you say?

32:28.156 --> 32:30.366
I think that's
quite the invitation, Ed,

32:30.450 --> 32:32.118
but there's
so much going on.

32:32.201 --> 32:34.829
I just feel like
there's not enough time.

32:34.912 --> 32:36.623
Oh, what's
the matter, Bic?

32:36.706 --> 32:39.042
Afraid of getting your asses
kicked by some old-timers?

32:43.755 --> 32:45.214
I don't think so, Pops.

32:51.429 --> 32:54.265
All things considered, not
that bad for a Shotgun Intro.

32:54.349 --> 32:58.227
Not that bad? I just set
Gretchen's grandmother on fire.

32:58.311 --> 33:01.022
Wrong. We sacrificed Grandma
for the sake of the mission.

33:01.105 --> 33:02.148
I feel terrible.

33:02.231 --> 33:04.275
Feelings are irrelevant
in the big con.

33:04.359 --> 33:06.569
What's important is that
our cover wasn't blown.

33:06.653 --> 33:09.238
Every test that we encounter
will be the same, pass or fail.

33:09.322 --> 33:11.199
As long as we pass, it
doesn't matter how we do it.

33:11.282 --> 33:13.326
I still can't believe they
actually bought all that

33:13.409 --> 33:15.620
People believe because they
have no reason not to.

33:15.703 --> 33:16.829
We're going to have to
be on top of our game.

33:16.913 --> 33:18.081
That family was sharp.

33:18.164 --> 33:19.374
Come on,
we've got to go.

33:19.457 --> 33:21.497
I've got some really important
people waiting on us.

33:22.377 --> 33:24.577
Look who I have?
Dougie-Doug-Doug!

33:24.587 --> 33:25.588
Dougie Fresh!

33:25.672 --> 33:26.714
Doug, you look great, man.

33:26.798 --> 33:27.840
You're losing weight,
fat ass.

33:27.924 --> 33:29.164
Oh, he had to
lose weight.

33:30.426 --> 33:31.761
Ow!

33:32.011 --> 33:34.347
All right.
All right, stop.

33:35.556 --> 33:37.058
Who are these people?
What, are you kidding?

33:37.141 --> 33:38.518
You don't recognize these guys?
No.

33:38.601 --> 33:40.561
You're looking at your groomsmen.
Come on, man.

33:40.645 --> 33:41.729
Hey, Doug.

33:45.233 --> 33:46.233
How have you been, bro?

33:46.275 --> 33:48.528
Good. Yeah, real good. You?

33:48.611 --> 33:50.029
You know,
same old same old.

33:52.573 --> 33:54.534
Stop it, man.
Stop it, man.

33:54.617 --> 33:56.452
Every time. Every time.

33:56.536 --> 33:58.121
Jimmy, can I talk to you
for a second?

33:58.204 --> 33:59.956
These guys cannot
be my groomsmen.

34:00.039 --> 34:01.124
What are you
talking about?

34:01.207 --> 34:03.376
For one thing, it looks like
the entire cast of Goonies

34:03.459 --> 34:04.539
grew up and became rapists.

34:04.585 --> 34:05.753
This one in particular
looks like

34:05.837 --> 34:07.505
he just broke out of
a federal fucking prison.

34:07.588 --> 34:09.588
What you need to do is keep
it down because he did.

34:09.590 --> 34:10.800
And he raped
a lot of men in there. Yes.

34:10.882 --> 34:13.052
Oh, my God. Oh, Jesus.

34:13.136 --> 34:15.897
He's got a dark past, but when you
throw a tux on that son of a bitch,

34:15.929 --> 34:17.056
you're not going to
find anybody better.

34:17.139 --> 34:18.641
The Asian
has his dick out.

34:18.725 --> 34:20.184
Endo, put it up.

34:20.309 --> 34:22.018
No. You have to get
a new party trick.

34:22.103 --> 34:24.856
People love it.
Is that a third testicle?

34:24.981 --> 34:26.649
Does he have three testicles?
Yeah, I've got three.

34:26.733 --> 34:28.818
How is that a party trick?
That's neither here nor there.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.652
Oh, I'm dead. You didn't
give me a lot of time, man.

34:30.737 --> 34:31.737
Oh, God.

34:31.821 --> 34:33.531
You gave me seven names, I brought
you back seven groomsmen.

34:33.656 --> 34:35.533
I should just call it off. No!
These guys are great, man.

34:35.616 --> 34:38.077
You're looking at the best of the best.
Not the best of the best.

34:38.161 --> 34:40.288
They're the best of
what I had to choose from.

34:40.496 --> 34:42.415
I'm dead.

34:42.915 --> 34:44.250
We've got Dickerson.
Yo.

34:44.333 --> 34:46.293
Dickerson, you're a lounge
singer from Canada.

34:46.377 --> 34:48.795
You perform four nights a
week at the Walleye Nook.

34:48.880 --> 34:51.090
You do a mean Tom Jones.
Now, that part's imperative.

34:51.174 --> 34:52.717
She won't buy it unless she
knows that you can sing.

34:52.800 --> 34:53.885
Doug, I'm not
trying to be rude,

34:53.967 --> 34:55.094
but nobody here
really gives a fuck.

34:55.178 --> 34:56.262
We're just
assigning roles.

34:56.344 --> 34:58.139
We can get all the ancillary
particulars later on.

34:58.222 --> 34:59.307
Garvey,
you're a botanist.

34:59.390 --> 35:02.143
You and Doug went to camp together
from 6th grade through 10th.

35:02.226 --> 35:06.522
Rambis, you're a principal at Saint
Peter's Middle School in Provo, Utah.

35:06.606 --> 35:10.193
And you're a regional racquetball champion.
Lefty, good serve.

35:10.526 --> 35:11.944
Plunkett, you're a lawyer.

35:12.028 --> 35:15.281
You specialize in environmental
law with a focus on forestry.

35:15.364 --> 35:17.366
Carew, you're
a podiatrist in Knoxville.

35:17.450 --> 35:18.868
Divorced, no kids.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.912
I have to say, all these
guys seem a little off,

35:20.995 --> 35:22.663
but you
at least look normal.

35:22.747 --> 35:24.791
Oh, thanks, Doug,
I appreciate that, man.

35:25.208 --> 35:27.376
I'm just happy to
be here.

35:29.045 --> 35:30.880
Drysdale,
you teach philosophy

35:30.963 --> 35:32.465
at Bardonia
Community College.

35:32.548 --> 35:33.591
You're a vegan.

35:33.674 --> 35:36.803
You're also working on your first
book called The Way of Wonder.

35:36.886 --> 35:38.721
What the fuck
does that even mean?

35:38.805 --> 35:41.265
Thanks, Doug,
you fucking asshole.

35:41.349 --> 35:43.309
Alzado, you're
a computer programmer.

35:43.392 --> 35:44.352
You met Dougie
at a conference

35:44.435 --> 35:45.478
in Baton Rouge.

35:45.603 --> 35:46.604
Do you want to trade?

35:46.687 --> 35:48.022
Hell, yeah. I need to
eat some meat, man.

35:48.105 --> 35:49.106
This vegan life
isn't for me.

35:49.190 --> 35:50.900
Hey. There will be
no trading!

35:51.025 --> 35:53.319
Anything else, Doug? Yeah. Plunkett's
got to be in a wheelchair.

35:53.402 --> 35:54.737
He was hit by a car.
What?

35:54.821 --> 35:56.447
Well, it's not funny.

35:56.531 --> 35:57.657
I'm supposed to crush ass.

35:57.740 --> 35:59.033
I told him he was
going to crush ass.

35:59.116 --> 36:00.159
- Argh!
- Listen up.

36:00.243 --> 36:02.870
Double check your measurements
and perfect your PTD's, guys.

36:03.079 --> 36:05.206
"PTD'S"? That's your Party
Trick Distractions.

36:05.289 --> 36:07.208
If you get backed in a corner
and you don't know what to do,

36:07.291 --> 36:08.334
pull out your PTD.

36:08.417 --> 36:10.086
Can I do my Cockney accent?

36:10.253 --> 36:12.713
You're a principal in Utah. Why the
fuck would you have a Cockney accent?

36:12.797 --> 36:14.465
I could have
moved there, right?

36:16.217 --> 36:17.802
Any more questions?

36:17.885 --> 36:19.428
Yeah. When is
the bachelor party?

36:19.512 --> 36:21.013
I don't see nothing
in the package about it.

36:21.097 --> 36:22.223
That's a good question.

36:22.306 --> 36:24.141
Oh, no, no. There's going
to be no bachelor party.

36:24.225 --> 36:26.644
Gretchen and I, we both decided
that it was better that we...

36:26.769 --> 36:30.064
Stop. There's no such thing as a mutual
decision until after you're married.

36:30.147 --> 36:32.316
Right now, the only "we..."

36:32.400 --> 36:34.235
ls me and my balls.

36:34.402 --> 36:35.403
Balls.

36:35.695 --> 36:37.738
All right, guys, listen up.

36:38.614 --> 36:42.451
You have one week to know
this information so well,

36:42.910 --> 36:44.954
it becomes a permanent
part of your memory.

36:46.289 --> 36:50.376
That means that we've got one
week to pull off the first ever

36:51.961 --> 36:53.004
Golden Tux.

36:54.714 --> 36:57.592
Understand something. This has
never been done, gentlemen.

Go, go!

38:04.033 --> 38:05.034
What are you doing?

38:05.117 --> 38:06.877
It's a trick
I learned in Vietnam.

38:06.953 --> 38:08.663
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

38:09.372 --> 38:11.499
Just prepping for
a little bit of this.

38:11.582 --> 38:12.792
Tahiti?

38:12.875 --> 38:13.875
Voted the number-one

38:13.918 --> 38:15.628
most romantic
honeymoon destination.

38:15.795 --> 38:16.796
That's amazing!

38:16.879 --> 38:17.999
It's going to be incredible.

38:18.005 --> 38:20.257
Oh, my gosh. Honey, that's...

38:20.716 --> 38:22.301
Hey, what has gotten
into you this week?

38:22.385 --> 38:24.220
I've just never
seen you so frisky.

38:24.303 --> 38:26.013
I just feel really good
about everything.

38:26.097 --> 38:27.417
We're getting married
on Saturday.

38:27.473 --> 38:29.392
It's exciting. Your friends
are gonna be there.

38:29.475 --> 38:30.795
My friends are
all gonna be there.

38:30.893 --> 38:32.061
I just hope
it all goes smoothly.

38:32.144 --> 38:33.479
I checked
the 10-day forecast.

38:33.646 --> 38:36.232
Sweetie, it's LA. It's not
like it's going to rain.

38:36.732 --> 38:37.984
What the fuck
did you just say?

38:38.067 --> 38:39.777
Whoa.
Are you kidding?

38:39.860 --> 38:40.860
What are you doing?

38:40.903 --> 38:42.279
Why did you say
the fucking R-word?

38:42.363 --> 38:43.698
Shh.
Calm down. Calm down.

38:43.823 --> 38:45.700
I didn't say it was going to rain.

38:46.033 --> 38:48.536
You just said it again. This
is twice now in two minutes.

38:48.619 --> 38:49.912
Are you fucking serious?

38:49.996 --> 38:50.997
Gretchen, calm down.

38:51.080 --> 38:54.208
I just don't understand why you
continue to say this stupid shit.

38:54.291 --> 38:56.419
Okay, you're right. But you know what?

38:56.919 --> 38:59.547
We climbed
the glaciers of what?

39:00.214 --> 39:01.298
Uh...

39:01.382 --> 39:03.217
It was... It was, uh...

39:03.551 --> 39:05.344
It's Patagonia.
Padronia.

39:05.428 --> 39:06.428
Patagonia.

39:06.470 --> 39:07.596
Political views?

39:07.680 --> 39:08.723
Staunch Republican.
Got it.

39:08.889 --> 39:11.392
Patagonia.
Pagon.

39:11.767 --> 39:13.853
I'm a doctor.
What type?

39:13.936 --> 39:16.147
Podiatrist.
Is that right?

39:16.230 --> 39:18.024
I think that's right.
That's what it says?

39:18.107 --> 39:19.358
Yeah. I'm a kid doctor.

39:19.442 --> 39:20.609
No.

39:20.735 --> 39:22.486
What are your views
on gluten?

39:22.570 --> 39:23.779
It's a myth.

39:23.863 --> 39:25.156
Pata...
Pata...

39:25.239 --> 39:26.240
...go...

39:26.574 --> 39:29.326
My name is Hobie Plunkett
and I collect...

39:29.410 --> 39:31.454
Playbills.
Cabbage Patch Kids?

39:31.537 --> 39:34.206
No, man, it's exotic pets,
you dumb motherfucker.

39:34.290 --> 39:36.042
Dumb? You can't even say
"Patagonia," you idiot.

39:36.125 --> 39:37.209
Garvey's family
owns a "blank" farm.

39:37.293 --> 39:38.293
Chinchillas.

39:38.335 --> 39:39.670
Nice.

39:39.754 --> 39:41.589
Hey, come on, we have to
hammer out this toast, man.

39:41.672 --> 39:42.715
Right.

39:42.798 --> 39:44.592
They're going to want to
know why she's "the one."

39:44.675 --> 39:46.595
It's like a band playing
their most popular song.

39:46.677 --> 39:47.887
The crowd is just
waiting to hear it.

39:47.970 --> 39:49.690
Let's start with
the first time you saw her.

39:49.764 --> 39:52.892
Oh, she was
wearing a dress.

39:52.975 --> 39:56.645
And she was pretty.

39:58.314 --> 40:02.068
That's it? Why are you marrying her?
Why are you in love with her?

40:02.151 --> 40:04.361
What makes her different than any
other girl that you ever met?

40:04.445 --> 40:06.280
She talked to me.
She talked to you?

40:06.363 --> 40:08.824
What? Yeah, seriously. Her dad
was a client at the firm.

40:08.949 --> 40:10.409
I had seen her
a couple of times,

40:10.493 --> 40:11.973
but she never gave me
the time of day.

40:11.994 --> 40:15.247
And then one day I ran into
her, and it was just different.

40:15.331 --> 40:17.750
She knew my name, she asked
me to go get a sandwich.

40:17.833 --> 40:20.878
You're not helping me.
You have to dig deep.

40:20.961 --> 40:23.089
Like, "From across the
room, she looked at me"

40:23.172 --> 40:24.612
"and I swear it was like
slow motion.

40:24.840 --> 40:28.469
"All the room stood still. I closed
my eyes and I reached out my hand,

40:28.552 --> 40:30.179
"and in return,
I got a soul."

40:30.262 --> 40:33.015
"And that's when I knew
that we were soul mates."

40:33.099 --> 40:34.600
That's what I need, Doug.

40:34.683 --> 40:36.102
But that's not real.

40:39.605 --> 40:41.982
All right, Tonto.
Do you want to see real?

40:45.528 --> 40:47.988
Yo!
Puta madre. I'm coming.

40:50.282 --> 40:53.035
Hi! Oh, my God!

40:53.452 --> 40:56.288
What a delightful surprise.

40:56.372 --> 40:59.166
I wish you would have called before.
My place is a pig sty.

40:59.250 --> 41:00.584
Eddie. Hey,
Eddie, stop. Stop.

41:00.668 --> 41:02.169
No mas. He's one of us.

41:02.253 --> 41:03.296
What the fuck, cabrón?

41:03.379 --> 41:05.464
Yeah. What the hell
is going on here?

41:05.589 --> 41:07.716
I want to introduce you
to Dirty Eddie Sanchez.

41:09.051 --> 41:10.386
His family had
a wedding planning business

41:10.469 --> 41:12.304
that was one of
the biggest in the city.

41:12.388 --> 41:15.391
But, after Father of the Bride
came out on DVD and Blu-ray,

41:15.724 --> 41:17.268
nobody wanted to take advice
from a Mexican kid

41:17.351 --> 41:18.519
from Boyle Heights.

41:18.686 --> 41:20.846
So, what he decided to do
was flame it up a little bit.

41:21.480 --> 41:23.399
Hence, Edmundo.

41:23.899 --> 41:25.192
Da-da-da-da!

41:25.401 --> 41:26.610
Business skyrocketed.

41:26.694 --> 41:29.280
This is so fucked up
on so many levels.

41:29.697 --> 41:33.450
So, ese, why did you
bring him here?

41:33.576 --> 41:35.496
He's taking this wedding
thing way too seriously.

41:35.619 --> 41:38.747
All right, look, vato, weddings
are just overblown parties

41:38.831 --> 41:41.208
direct from women's
unreasonable fantasies

41:41.292 --> 41:43.586
and preconceived notions
that originated in childhood.

41:43.752 --> 41:45.712
So, don't sweat the morality
of what you're doing.

41:45.754 --> 41:48.257
Just make sure the bride
and her mother are happy.

41:48.340 --> 41:50.050
We're in this together,
homie.

41:50.259 --> 41:51.260
Is that your girl?

41:51.343 --> 41:52.720
Fuck no.
That's my sister.

41:53.470 --> 41:54.722
That's my girl.

41:55.014 --> 41:56.765
What's up?
Oh, fuck.

41:56.849 --> 41:58.100
Do you want some nachos?

41:58.184 --> 41:59.226
I'm actually okay.

41:59.310 --> 42:00.311
No, late before I came.

42:00.394 --> 42:01.353
I'm sorry.
What did you just ask them?

42:01.437 --> 42:02.438
I asked them if
they wanted nachos.

42:02.521 --> 42:03.522
Nachos?

42:03.606 --> 42:04.690
The guy's getting
married in a week

42:04.773 --> 42:05.900
and you're gonna
offer him nachos?

42:05.983 --> 42:08.027
Look at him! What do you think
cheese is going to do to him?

42:08.110 --> 42:09.236
I thought
they wanted nachos.

42:09.320 --> 42:10.446
Use your fucking head.

42:10.613 --> 42:11.697
I'm going to take some.

42:11.780 --> 42:12.780
Sit down, Jimmy!

42:12.823 --> 42:14.366
I tried.

42:16.785 --> 42:20.039
They've been together for some time now.
Nothing's going to happen.

42:20.122 --> 42:21.540
What?
Nothing.

42:21.624 --> 42:23.083
You guys make
a beautiful couple.

42:23.167 --> 42:24.210
Bitches, right?

42:25.794 --> 42:27.504
Do you want some weed?

42:27.588 --> 42:28.631
No, no, I'm good.

42:28.881 --> 42:30.841
♪ You put the weed

42:30.925 --> 42:32.551

You two better not
fuck this up.

42:58.953 --> 43:00.037
Why are we here?

43:00.120 --> 43:01.956
It's called a dry run.
I do it with all my grooms.

43:02.039 --> 43:03.916
I hate this stuff.

43:03.999 --> 43:07.711
Hey, that's why we're here.
Groom desensitization, okay?

43:07.795 --> 43:09.421
That's a rum and Coke.
That's your favorite, right?

43:09.505 --> 43:10.464
Yeah. How did you know that?

43:10.547 --> 43:12.174
I know everything, Doug.
Drink up.

43:12.258 --> 43:14.009
All right, I want you to
keep reminding yourself that

43:14.093 --> 43:15.173
weddings are for the women.

43:15.219 --> 43:17.304
You're not supposed
to enjoy yourself, Doug.

43:17.388 --> 43:19.265
If you were, there would
be big-screen TVs,

43:19.348 --> 43:20.391
there would be gambling.

43:20.474 --> 43:21.600
There's none of that there.

43:21.684 --> 43:23.894
Okay, NAS
and we won't get caught.

43:23.978 --> 43:25.396
Wait, what?

43:25.479 --> 43:27.606
NAS, Doug.

43:27.690 --> 43:30.859
Nod and smile.
All right? Let's go.

43:34.029 --> 43:35.614
You all look good.

43:36.865 --> 43:37.908
How are you, man?
Oh.

43:40.369 --> 43:42.705
And I said, well,
put the money in the bag.

43:44.665 --> 43:46.834
Hello.
Uh-oh. Showtime.

43:47.209 --> 43:48.769
Now, is this guy also a pro?
Yeah!

43:48.794 --> 43:50.212
No. This guy
is not a professional.

43:51.380 --> 43:53.382
Just kidding. I'm just kidding.

43:54.008 --> 43:56.427
The moment Chris asked me
to be his best man,

43:56.510 --> 43:59.555
I sat down and I wrote
a pretty awesome speech.

44:00.806 --> 44:03.726
But I don't know. I think I'd
rather speak from the heart.

44:05.144 --> 44:06.145
Oh, don't do that.

44:06.228 --> 44:08.068
Don't you rip that paper up.
You never do that.

44:09.857 --> 44:12.192
Uh, you know, when Chris...

44:13.027 --> 44:15.529
When Chris and I
first met, we, um...

44:17.406 --> 44:18.699
Uh, well...

44:19.533 --> 44:22.661
Chris and I have known
each other since, uh...

44:26.332 --> 44:27.499
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

44:29.543 --> 44:33.339
Chris and I, you know,
we did stuff together.

44:37.468 --> 44:38.761
He's going to throw up
on the fucking bride.

44:38.844 --> 44:42.848
And, um, Chris has been
like a brother to me.

44:43.265 --> 44:46.101
Well, because
my real brother died.

44:46.602 --> 44:49.021
No. Well, he didn't
die immediately.

44:49.104 --> 44:52.149
They revived him in the ambulance,
and then, he died later.

44:52.566 --> 44:53.567
Is he serious?

44:55.444 --> 44:56.779
Adolf Hitler
once said...

44:56.862 --> 44:58.447
Holy fucking shit.

44:59.073 --> 45:00.949
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh, God.

45:01.116 --> 45:02.201
I'm just going to...

45:02.284 --> 45:05.788
There was this one thing
I wanted to reference.

45:06.455 --> 45:09.458
You know what? Fuck it.
Wolverines, brother!

45:09.917 --> 45:11.543
I love you. Thank you.

45:11.627 --> 45:13.128
That's not
even the right way.

45:13.212 --> 45:14.963
It's not an exit.

45:15.756 --> 45:17.841
Okay. One, two...

45:19.218 --> 45:21.011
♪ Ain't no mountain
high enough ♪

45:21.095 --> 45:22.971

Yeah.

45:23.305 --> 45:25.140
Let's go dance.
No, thanks.

45:25.307 --> 45:27.393
Douglas, you can hide
a fat ass in baggy pants,

45:27.476 --> 45:28.936
but you cannot
hide a bad dancer.

45:29.019 --> 45:30.145
Come on,
I'll teach you some basics.

45:30.229 --> 45:31.397
I'm not dancing.

45:31.480 --> 45:33.357
It is my job to make you look
good on your wedding day.

45:33.440 --> 45:34.525
Now, I need you
to get comfortable

45:34.608 --> 45:36.485
with being uncomfortable.
Come on.

45:37.361 --> 45:39.238
Stop being a pussy.
Let's dance.

45:44.493 --> 45:45.494
Come on, you lead.

45:45.577 --> 45:46.829
No, I don't want to lead.

45:46.912 --> 45:48.539
Okay, then, fine,
be the chick, Doug.

45:48.997 --> 45:51.291
On second thought, I will lead.
Whatever, Doug.

45:51.375 --> 45:52.855
Just follow me.
I really don't get it.

46:02.177 --> 46:03.220
Back.

46:04.930 --> 46:07.224
Nice rond de jambe.
Thanks.

46:08.475 --> 46:09.768
Twelve years of
dance lessons.

46:09.852 --> 46:11.979
My mom said, "One day,
they would come in handy."

46:12.271 --> 46:13.939
I doubt this is
what she had in mind.

46:15.482 --> 46:16.762
You asked how
a gal like Gretchen

46:16.817 --> 46:18.193
could fall for
a yutz like me.

46:18.444 --> 46:19.653

47:48.575 --> 47:49.826
Hey!

47:53.205 --> 47:56.750
So, I get a call out of
nowhere, a guy I went to school with.

47:56.917 --> 47:58.835
I barely even knew the kid.

47:58.919 --> 48:02.422
He goes,
"I just got engaged."

48:02.631 --> 48:05.801
Naturally, I go, "Great.
Congratulations."

48:07.427 --> 48:10.514
Then, he says,
"Can you be my best man?"

48:10.597 --> 48:12.140
I barely knew the kid.

48:12.224 --> 48:14.309
Wow, that is so weird.

48:14.393 --> 48:16.687
So, I get to thinking, "What's
the worst that can happen?"

48:16.853 --> 48:19.648
The guy's wedding party
consisted of me,

48:20.566 --> 48:22.150
the bride's brother,

48:22.651 --> 48:25.153
and this Filipino
exchange student.

48:25.612 --> 48:27.531
And it was so sad, Doug.

48:27.614 --> 48:30.075
Everybody is thinking,
"Why in the hell"

48:30.158 --> 48:32.327
"would this woman
marry this loser?"

48:32.411 --> 48:35.914
So, I grab the microphone and
I just get to talking about

48:35.998 --> 48:40.669
how we climbed the Himalayas,
how we fished for sharks,

48:41.003 --> 48:43.839
how this guy saved me in
a barroom brawl one time.

48:43.922 --> 48:45.340
So much bullshit.

48:45.674 --> 48:50.012
And I look over and I see the bride.
She's got his arm, Doug.

48:50.095 --> 48:53.140
She's got his arm so tight
and she's glowing.

48:53.515 --> 48:56.018
Because she's marrying
this amazing guy.

48:56.101 --> 48:59.104
This man comes up
to me and goes, "Wow."

49:00.022 --> 49:01.857
"I would pay money"

49:02.357 --> 49:05.027
"to have somebody talk like
that about me at my wedding."

49:06.194 --> 49:07.362
Light bulb.

49:08.030 --> 49:11.491
That's the day that this
wedding hustle was born.

49:11.575 --> 49:14.536
That's the day that I
became The Wedding Ringer.

49:21.918 --> 49:23.045
I, uh...

49:23.128 --> 49:27.215
Now, I don't want you to think
that I'm some sort of schmuck

49:27.299 --> 49:28.842
who doesn't have
any friends.

49:28.925 --> 49:29.926
No.

49:30.052 --> 49:31.637
You know, my father,

49:31.720 --> 49:33.639
he was an international
tax attorney, right?

49:33.722 --> 49:35.974
So, we moved around
all the time.

49:37.351 --> 49:40.312
I went to 13 different
schools by the eighth grade.

49:40.395 --> 49:42.064
I lived on four
different continents.

49:42.189 --> 49:44.733
And after a while
I just figured,

49:45.651 --> 49:47.277
"Why even make
friends anymore?"

49:47.736 --> 49:50.364
"I'm just going to have to move, anyway.
What's the point?"

49:50.864 --> 49:55.452
And then, when my dad died,
I took over the business.

49:56.078 --> 49:59.081
I was just working so much.
I was working too much.

50:00.499 --> 50:02.209
Am I a loser?

50:04.169 --> 50:05.253
No.

50:06.421 --> 50:08.061
This is what you have
to understand, Doug.

50:10.258 --> 50:12.386
Some people are just loners.

50:13.679 --> 50:15.097
It's that simple, man.

50:16.223 --> 50:17.933
Maybe I don't
want to be.

50:18.183 --> 50:21.436
Maybe I just want someone
to grab a beer with,

50:23.188 --> 50:26.566
to go on
a cool guy trip with.

50:27.651 --> 50:29.444
You've never been
on a guy trip, Doug?

50:30.445 --> 50:34.741
Cabo, Cancun, spring break? You've
never done anything like that?

50:35.075 --> 50:37.369
I never really had
anyone to go with.

50:45.377 --> 50:46.795
Good night, Tonto.

50:48.463 --> 50:49.965
I gotta say,
it feels really good

50:50.048 --> 50:51.591
to have somebody
looking out for me.

50:51.883 --> 50:53.135
I got your back, man.

50:53.343 --> 50:56.805
I like that.
And I got your back, too.

51:03.145 --> 51:04.479
Hey, Doug.

51:04.855 --> 51:06.857
I like you, man.
I think you're a great guy.

51:07.023 --> 51:09.583
I just want you to remember that
this is a business relationship.

51:09.776 --> 51:11.403
It doesn't mean that we're
going to be best friends.

51:11.486 --> 51:12.904
That's not how
this story ends.

51:13.488 --> 51:15.782
I'm just an employee with a job to do.
I get it.

51:16.241 --> 51:19.119
You're not my best friend.
You're just my best man.

51:19.202 --> 51:20.620
In one week,
Bic will be on a plane

51:20.704 --> 51:22.080
headed back to
the Middle East.

51:22.164 --> 51:24.666
Three months from now, he'll get
killed in a tragic: grenade accident

51:24.750 --> 51:27.669
while giving an impromptu
sermon on the back of a Humvee.

51:29.838 --> 51:32.132
It doesn't mean that we're not
going to have a good time, Doug.

51:32.215 --> 51:33.925
I said I got it.

51:34.134 --> 51:38.221
You're anybody's best friend for a
price, but nobody's when it counts.

51:57.199 --> 51:59.039
Is everything okay?
What's the matter with you?

52:00.243 --> 52:01.328
I don't know.

52:02.537 --> 52:03.747
Well, now.

52:04.498 --> 52:07.000
I never expected
the "Jimmy Callahan"

52:07.083 --> 52:09.544
to get all soft-eyed
over a client.

52:09.628 --> 52:12.047
No, no, it's not like that.

52:12.547 --> 52:14.382
All I do is go
from job to job,

52:14.466 --> 52:16.218
saving these losers
with no friends.

52:16.384 --> 52:17.385
Losers?

52:18.428 --> 52:19.721
Come on, Jimmy.

52:21.973 --> 52:24.643
They're not losers.
They're just guys.

52:26.228 --> 52:29.147
They don't share their private,
deep emotional feelings

52:29.231 --> 52:30.565
with each other
like women do.

52:31.274 --> 52:32.442
Women are nurturers.

52:32.901 --> 52:35.570
We sit and listen to
each other's problems.

52:36.238 --> 52:38.031
Which is why we're
always so miserable,

52:38.114 --> 52:40.242
from all that
goddamn listening.

52:40.325 --> 52:42.953
You should
count your blessings.

52:44.329 --> 52:45.914
I still think
they're losers.

52:46.248 --> 52:49.501
Well, maybe you're right. But
let me ask you this, Jimmy.

52:50.252 --> 52:53.129
If you ever found a woman
crazy enough to marry you,

52:54.923 --> 52:57.008
who would be your best man?

53:01.596 --> 53:06.142
See, this all started because you
wanted to make a guy feel good.

53:07.811 --> 53:10.522
Do you remember how good you felt
the first time you did this?

53:11.648 --> 53:13.316
Well, you've lost that.

53:14.442 --> 53:17.070
You've become jaded
with all your rules.

53:17.279 --> 53:20.407
You forgot what got you into this
business in the first place.

53:21.366 --> 53:23.702
Your ability to be a friend,

53:24.828 --> 53:26.621
to change someone's life.

53:31.710 --> 53:33.587
Now, Jimmy,
we have less than a week

53:33.670 --> 53:36.131
to pull off
the first ever Golden Tux.

53:36.715 --> 53:39.467
So, I'm going to need you to
stop crying like a little girl,

53:39.551 --> 53:40.802
strap on a pair,

53:40.886 --> 53:43.722
stop wasting time
feeling sorry for yourself,

53:43.805 --> 53:45.807
and let's bring
this shit home.

53:51.771 --> 53:53.565
Doug Harris, right?
Uh, yeah.

53:53.648 --> 53:54.928
Come here, you little shit.
Wait!

53:54.941 --> 53:56.701
Have you ever been to the 'hood?
Here you go.

53:57.444 --> 54:00.322
Somebody help me! I'm not Doug Harris!

54:00.405 --> 54:01.698
Why did you kick me
in my balls?

54:01.781 --> 54:03.408
Help me! No!

54:03.491 --> 54:04.868
Throw his ass in the truck!

54:04.951 --> 54:06.119
Get back there!

54:06.244 --> 54:07.454
Go, go, go!

54:10.415 --> 54:12.417
I'm not strapped in!

54:13.668 --> 54:15.128
What was that?
Shit!

54:17.339 --> 54:19.716
Oh, God, which way
is the sidewalk?

54:19.799 --> 54:21.509
Doug, don't move!

54:29.351 --> 54:32.896
Someone help me!
Please, God! Please!

54:33.355 --> 54:34.940
I'm begging you!

54:37.651 --> 54:38.818
Help!

54:40.570 --> 54:42.238
Anybody!

54:53.041 --> 54:54.459
Take his pants off!

54:56.419 --> 54:57.712
You pay for the Golden Tux,

54:57.796 --> 54:59.556
you get a bachelor party,
you son of a bitch!

55:01.591 --> 55:05.553
To the house!
Don't pop that shit!

55:13.895 --> 55:15.605
Hey. Hi.

55:15.689 --> 55:16.940
Oh.
Nadia.

55:17.399 --> 55:19.484
Hi. I'm Doug. Doug Harris.

55:22.445 --> 55:23.780
Do you speak English?

55:23.947 --> 55:25.240
Oh.

55:25.323 --> 55:26.825
Have you ever been
to a Dodger game?

55:26.908 --> 55:28.743
Do you like the Dodgers?

55:28.827 --> 55:30.245
Oh, this is happening.
Shh!

55:30.328 --> 55:31.496
Okay, so,
here's the deal.

55:31.579 --> 55:34.165
I'm about to get married to
this great girl, Gretchen.

55:34.416 --> 55:36.584
Oh! Gee!

55:37.085 --> 55:38.086
Shh!
Um...

55:38.169 --> 55:39.671
Oh, boy!

It's about you having
a good goddamn time, man.

57:15.100 --> 57:16.768
Nadia.
No!

57:16.851 --> 57:19.132
Nadia! Nadia!
We got through this already.

57:19.771 --> 57:21.773
You smell so sweet.

57:21.856 --> 57:23.358
Ohh!

57:23.441 --> 57:25.485
Lick that
nutty butter!

57:25.568 --> 57:27.737
Nadia, you don't
have to do this.

What? Wait.

Fletcher!
Fletcher! Fletcher!

57:37.247 --> 57:38.873
Nadia, do not
give me a fletcher.

57:41.751 --> 57:43.545
Okay, this shit's gone far enough!

57:46.506 --> 57:47.966
Oh, Nadia, no!

57:48.758 --> 57:51.302
Oh, God, it feels so good,
but I don't want you to.

57:51.386 --> 57:52.470
Talk me through it, Doug!

57:52.554 --> 57:55.223
It feels so scruffy and wet.

57:55.974 --> 57:58.726
Why are you
licking so rapidly?

57:59.519 --> 58:00.728
I love my fiancée,
I love my fiancée.

58:00.812 --> 58:02.188
How does that feel?

58:08.903 --> 58:11.239
Oh, God! Okay! Okay!

58:17.245 --> 58:18.329
Oh, shit!

58:19.497 --> 58:20.874
When you pull, it hurts!

58:22.500 --> 58:23.585
Stick a finger in his ass!

58:23.668 --> 58:25.461
Not my ass,
the dog's ass!

58:25.545 --> 58:27.172
- It's not working!
- Get it off!

58:31.134 --> 58:33.178
What the fuck, Plunkett?
Oh, shit.

58:33.261 --> 58:35.263
I didn't shoot him. I shot up.
That dog is dead.

58:36.598 --> 58:37.758
I just
tried to scare him off.

58:37.807 --> 58:39.127
Shit, the fucking dog
has lockjaw.

58:39.142 --> 58:40.185
It must have had
a heart attack.

58:40.268 --> 58:42.937
There's a
dead dog on my dick.

58:43.313 --> 58:44.713
I've got to get
to a hospital, guys.

58:44.772 --> 58:45.892
His dick is bleeding!

58:45.940 --> 58:47.025
The hospital's right
around the corner, okay?

58:47.108 --> 58:48.109
You have to hold on.

58:48.276 --> 58:49.277
Hurry up, Lou.

58:49.360 --> 58:51.279
Every time it moves,
it hurts!

58:51.362 --> 58:53.156
Where's the alcohol?
Somebody give me the alcohol!

58:53.239 --> 58:54.282
Just breathe, Dougie!

58:54.365 --> 58:55.491
That just burns!

58:55.658 --> 58:57.493
Whoa, whoa!
Red light, red light!

58:59.787 --> 59:01.789
- What the fuck was that?
- Was that a cop?

59:01.873 --> 59:02.957
No, it was just a cab.

59:05.001 --> 59:06.419
Shit! We have open
bottles in here.

59:06.502 --> 59:09.380
I can't go back to jail!
I'm tired of fucking dudes!

59:09.464 --> 59:11.424
You were the rapist?
Finish your bottles!

59:11.507 --> 59:13.551
Everybody, chill out!
Put the bottles down,

59:13.635 --> 59:15.511
put your drugs away.
Do you hear me?

59:15.637 --> 59:17.180
This is Marci's
father's van.

59:17.263 --> 59:18.264
I'm only 15!

59:19.432 --> 59:20.516
Pullover.

59:20.600 --> 59:22.352
Lou, you have to pull
the fucking car over.

59:22.727 --> 59:23.853
Pull the fucking car over.

59:23.937 --> 59:25.730
Oh, God,
Marci's going to kill me.

59:25.855 --> 59:27.023
You're going to
get through this, man.

59:27.106 --> 59:28.107
This isn't going to be long.

59:28.191 --> 59:29.484
Get me
out of the car.

59:29.567 --> 59:31.194
They're going to think
I kidnapped this white girl.

59:31.319 --> 59:33.112
Take it. Take the gun. I don't
want this motherfucker, man.

59:33.196 --> 59:34.239
No! You take it back.

59:34.322 --> 59:35.922
Shush! Shut up.
You talk too much.

59:35.990 --> 59:37.367
I don't want it.
Take it.

59:37.825 --> 59:40.453
Put it in your titties. I'm
not going to jail for this.

59:41.037 --> 59:42.705
I can still see it.

59:43.122 --> 59:46.542
Shut up! This is real!
Everybody look normal. Okay?

59:55.718 --> 59:57.011
Have you guys been
drinking tonight?

59:57.095 --> 59:58.513
No, sir.

01:00:00.473 --> 01:00:01.599
Not even a little bit?

01:00:01.683 --> 01:00:02.725
No.

01:00:07.897 --> 01:00:09.774
Are you all right, sir?
Uh-huh.

01:00:09.857 --> 01:00:10.900
Is that a dog?

01:00:13.027 --> 01:00:14.946
Yeah. Why is his mouth
on your genitals?

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:17.657
Oh, God.

01:00:23.705 --> 01:00:25.373
Lou, what the
fuck are you doing?

01:00:25.456 --> 01:00:27.709
What in the fuck, Lou?

01:00:30.211 --> 01:00:31.838
Stop the car, you old dick!

01:00:33.423 --> 01:00:34.924
Lou, watch the Buick
on your right!

01:00:37.427 --> 01:00:40.596
Do you have to hit
every single meter, Lou?

01:00:42.181 --> 01:00:45.226
- Come on, what are you doing, Lou?
- No guts, no glory!

01:00:47.937 --> 01:00:48.938
It's a one-way street!

01:00:49.022 --> 01:00:50.222
I know!
It's the way I'm going!

01:00:50.315 --> 01:00:51.941
Look out! BRONSTEIN:
Stop the car!

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:55.360
I hate you, Lou!

01:00:55.403 --> 01:00:56.446
Fuck, Lou, stop!

01:01:00.033 --> 01:01:01.117
Lou, this is a closed road!

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.440
You're going
the wrong way, Lou!

01:01:02.452 --> 01:01:04.495
I don't have a
fucking seat belt on, Lou!

01:01:05.705 --> 01:01:08.750
Holy shit!
There's a gap in the bridge!

01:01:11.836 --> 01:01:13.129
We're all
going to die!

01:01:13.212 --> 01:01:14.255
Oh, my God!

01:01:14.756 --> 01:01:16.507
No!

01:01:29.645 --> 01:01:31.022
Oh, my God!

01:01:31.105 --> 01:01:32.345
We made it!

01:01:33.066 --> 01:01:35.693
Yeah!
Suck on this, copper.

01:01:43.326 --> 01:01:44.410
Nadia.

01:01:44.911 --> 01:01:47.914
Hey. You waited
all night for me?

01:01:49.582 --> 01:01:50.917
You know, last night,

01:01:52.502 --> 01:01:54.504
that was the greatest night
of my entire life.

01:01:56.923 --> 01:02:00.468
I don't think I've ever felt a
connection to anybody like that before.

01:02:01.969 --> 01:02:04.305
I know you can't
understand any of this.

01:02:07.350 --> 01:02:08.684
But I...
Tonto.

01:02:09.102 --> 01:02:10.102
How is it hanging?

01:02:10.144 --> 01:02:12.397
I'm kind of numb.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:13.898
What did they do?

01:02:13.981 --> 01:02:15.566
Oh, they put some stitches
in your penis head.

01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:16.984
The doctor said
you'll be okay, though.

01:02:17.110 --> 01:02:18.194
Come on,
kiss her goodbye.

01:02:19.862 --> 01:02:23.282
I've gotta go. It was really
great getting to know you.

01:02:36.295 --> 01:02:38.381
It was great
getting to know you, too.

01:02:40.508 --> 01:02:42.427
Wait. You speak English?

01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:44.178
Thanks for having me
out again, Jimmy.

01:02:44.929 --> 01:02:46.931
Doug here
is a real keeper.

01:02:48.474 --> 01:02:51.269
Call me sometime. Maybe we
can catch a Dodger game.

01:02:55.314 --> 01:02:57.233
"Dodger game" is
code-word for fucking.

01:03:00.695 --> 01:03:01.737
Fellows.

01:03:02.363 --> 01:03:03.448
Where's Lou?

01:03:03.531 --> 01:03:05.116
Lou had to go away
for a while.

01:03:05.199 --> 01:03:07.368
He said it was
worth it, though.

01:03:10.705 --> 01:03:11.789
Burn this.

01:03:16.919 --> 01:03:21.340
I haven't felt this good,
this happy since...

01:03:21.424 --> 01:03:22.508
Since ever.

01:03:22.758 --> 01:03:24.385
Did you take one of those pills
Plunkett was handing out?

01:03:24.427 --> 01:03:26.345
The ones that looked like Altoids?
Yes! Did you take one?

01:03:26.429 --> 01:03:27.909
Yeah, I took one.
What did I tell you?

01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:29.432
You said don't take anything
that looks like drugs.

01:03:29.557 --> 01:03:31.350
Then why did you take it? Because
it looked like an Altoid.

01:03:31.434 --> 01:03:32.477
It wasn't an Altoid, Doug.

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.686
Nah, I realized that
soon after.

01:03:33.769 --> 01:03:36.439
I said, "Stay your ass away from
Plunkett." Didn't I tell you that?

01:03:37.523 --> 01:03:39.233
Now, I know
none of this is real,

01:03:39.317 --> 01:03:41.569
but it's good to be
one of the guys.

01:03:41.777 --> 01:03:43.196
It really is.

01:03:50.244 --> 01:03:52.205
Come on. Let's go get
you cleaned up, man.

01:03:56.125 --> 01:03:58.836
So, uh, let's just go and
knock this thing out, man.

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:01.422
We'll make you look great,
rock your wedding,

01:04:01.923 --> 01:04:05.676
send you off to Tahiti so you
can blow Gretchen's back out.

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.428
Knock her back loose.

01:04:07.512 --> 01:04:10.473
And then, we ship Father Bic:
off to his untimely death.

01:04:16.270 --> 01:04:19.315
I was thinking about what you asked
me the other day about Gretchen.

01:04:19.398 --> 01:04:20.399
Mmm-hmm.

01:04:20.483 --> 01:04:23.361
And on our third date,
she said something

01:04:23.444 --> 01:04:24.684
about wanting to
start a family,

01:04:24.737 --> 01:04:26.030
how she was
ready to have kids.

01:04:26.489 --> 01:04:28.950
And I don't know, ever
since I lost my family,

01:04:30.243 --> 01:04:31.843
I've always wanted
to make one of my own.

01:04:34.956 --> 01:04:36.165
Hey, do me a favor.

01:04:36.249 --> 01:04:38.376
Be very gentle with my car.
I've seen your car...

01:04:38.459 --> 01:04:40.044
Ain't nobody gonna
mess up this shit.

01:04:40.127 --> 01:04:41.128
Okay.

01:04:41.212 --> 01:04:42.588
Why don't you go put
some ice on your dick?

01:04:42.672 --> 01:04:44.715
Yeah. No kidding,
right? God.

01:04:46.008 --> 01:04:47.385
Hello.
I got a problem.

01:04:47.468 --> 01:04:48.588
I can't be there
on Saturday.

01:04:48.636 --> 01:04:49.804
What are you
talking about, Garv?

01:04:49.887 --> 01:04:51.514
Marci's dad found a butt plug
in the glove compartment.

01:04:51.597 --> 01:04:52.640
She knows I'm working
with you again.

01:04:52.723 --> 01:04:54.976
I had to promise to fix the kitchen
cabinets to get her to calm down.

01:04:55.059 --> 01:04:56.269
No. You're going to be there.
Do you hear me?

01:04:56.352 --> 01:04:58.229
I'll call Marci myself. Is
that what you want me to do?

01:04:58.312 --> 01:04:59.397
I'll tell her about Kokomo.

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:01.232
Lurch,
where are you?

01:05:01.315 --> 01:05:02.608
Look, Jimmy, come on.
No, don't "Look, Jimmy" me.

01:05:02.692 --> 01:05:03.734
I'm not playing the
"Look, Jimmy" game.

01:05:03.818 --> 01:05:05.194
No, we all made a pact.

01:05:05.278 --> 01:05:07.358
You said the kitchen cabinets
would be done by today.

01:05:07.363 --> 01:05:09.282
Just tell Marci that you'll do
the kitchen cabinets on Sunday.

01:05:09.365 --> 01:05:10.992
Jimmy, go die in a fire!
I hate you.

01:05:11.325 --> 01:05:13.619
I hope your dick
gets chopped off.

01:05:13.703 --> 01:05:15.246
Roger Delta Niner.

01:05:15.329 --> 01:05:17.915
And may God bless
whoever else is on this.

01:05:19.709 --> 01:05:22.128
Hey.
Who is Jimmy?

01:05:23.713 --> 01:05:26.340
Jimmy is actually a tag.

01:05:26.507 --> 01:05:27.800
It's a tag name.
Military code.

01:05:27.883 --> 01:05:29.176
Military code?

01:05:29.552 --> 01:05:31.512
So, I suppose
I shouldn't pry into

01:05:31.596 --> 01:05:34.098
the meaning of "kitchen
cabinets" then, either.

01:05:34.181 --> 01:05:37.727
For your safety, no. I would
kind of leave it alone.

01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:40.062
All right, I'll see
you at the rehearsal dinner.

01:05:40.146 --> 01:05:41.522
See you then.

01:05:42.148 --> 01:05:43.899
Father.
Okay.

01:05:45.318 --> 01:05:46.819
Oh, God.

01:05:49.655 --> 01:05:52.033
Six violins,
two violas, two cellos,

01:05:52.283 --> 01:05:53.701
one contrabass,
one electric bass,

01:05:53.784 --> 01:05:56.287
two guitars, one drum set,
and I'll be singing.

01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:58.748
And your first dance
will be to what song?

01:05:58.914 --> 01:06:01.667
To our song,
You Are So Beautiful.

01:06:04.253 --> 01:06:06.464
That's by Joe Cooker.
Thanks.

01:06:08.257 --> 01:06:10.259
What?
That's not our song.

01:06:10.593 --> 01:06:12.219
That's not our song.

01:06:12.303 --> 01:06:14.138
Honey, of course it is.

01:06:14.221 --> 01:06:15.598
No, it's not.

01:06:15.681 --> 01:06:17.433
Yeah. Babe,
don't you remember?

01:06:17.558 --> 01:06:20.978
Your broken CD player repeated
it over and over and over

01:06:21.062 --> 01:06:22.563
the first time
we made love.

01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:24.815
Oh.
It was so amazing.

01:06:25.941 --> 01:06:27.818
That wasn't me.

01:06:27.902 --> 01:06:30.529
That was your ex, Steve.

01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:32.031
And I know that
because you've told me

01:06:32.114 --> 01:06:34.075
this story about five times.

01:06:34.784 --> 01:06:36.369
So...
Oh.

01:06:38.913 --> 01:06:41.540
Well, you know, honey, it's
still such a beautiful song.

01:06:41.624 --> 01:06:44.126
I mean, when you
really listen to the words.

01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:46.962
Honey, it's my favorite.
Please.

01:06:50.383 --> 01:06:51.384
Sure.

01:06:52.259 --> 01:06:53.511
Yay.

01:06:53.594 --> 01:06:55.096
I'm going to need a deposit.

01:06:55.596 --> 01:06:57.848
Gentlemen,
in these wallets,

01:06:57.932 --> 01:07:00.643
you have a license,
credit cards,

01:07:00.726 --> 01:07:04.146
and $300 cash.

01:07:04.438 --> 01:07:05.981
These bags here
contain your suits

01:07:06.065 --> 01:07:08.275
for the rehearsal dinner
as well as the wedding.

01:07:08.359 --> 01:07:12.488
You guys get some rest. We leave
for the high school at 0800.

01:07:13.155 --> 01:07:15.449
What are we doing
at the high school?

01:07:18.953 --> 01:07:20.204
Hey, Dad.

01:07:20.287 --> 01:07:21.580
Don't ever call me Dad.

01:07:21.831 --> 01:07:24.417
So, we were thinking maybe the
field's a little too muddy today.

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:25.501
You sound like my daughters.

01:07:25.584 --> 01:07:27.086
It doesn't get any
better than this, boys.

01:07:27.169 --> 01:07:28.337
Come on, you pussies.

01:07:28.713 --> 01:07:30.513
Okay. Yeah, all right.
All right. Sounds good.

01:07:31.048 --> 01:07:32.408
We're playing
these old guys?

01:07:32.425 --> 01:07:34.802
Listen. Let's just keep it
fun, fellows, all right?

01:07:34.885 --> 01:07:36.554
Go out here,
amuse these old geezers.

01:07:36.637 --> 01:07:37.930
There's no need
to rub it in their faces.

01:07:38.013 --> 01:07:39.390
We wouldn't want
to see any coronaries.

01:07:39.515 --> 01:07:41.142
You boys look
a little soft.

01:07:41.225 --> 01:07:42.425
That dude
looks familiar.

01:07:43.227 --> 01:07:45.104
Are you sure you can
handle going both ways?

01:07:45.187 --> 01:07:47.481
I heard Doug enjoys that.
What?

01:07:49.483 --> 01:07:51.193
Sit, pal! Pussies!

01:07:53.487 --> 01:07:54.989
He's open!

01:07:55.156 --> 01:07:56.824
Chop block!
That's a chop block!

01:07:56.991 --> 01:07:59.201
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Touchdown. Seven-zip.

01:07:59.368 --> 01:08:01.495
I just got punched. I thought
this was touch football.

01:08:01.662 --> 01:08:04.039
You can't play football
without blocking, bitch.

01:08:04.165 --> 01:08:05.645
That old motherfucker
is fast as shit.

01:08:05.666 --> 01:08:06.625
They just caught us
off guard.

01:08:06.709 --> 01:08:07.918
Can we discuss
the rules again?

01:08:08.002 --> 01:08:09.503
Come on, Doug, get up.
Good D!

01:08:10.212 --> 01:08:11.672
It's Webster!

01:08:12.006 --> 01:08:14.049
Those old guys
are fast and crazy, man.

01:08:14.133 --> 01:08:16.010
This is Sean John, bitch!

01:08:16.176 --> 01:08:17.845
Back on your side, loser.

01:08:19.013 --> 01:08:20.096
You have a really
nice arm, sir.

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:21.724
Blow me, kid.
Oh...

01:08:22.183 --> 01:08:24.518
Hut! Let's go, Doug!

01:08:27.729 --> 01:08:29.189
I don't have the ball!

01:08:30.024 --> 01:08:31.024
Take that, gimp!

01:08:31.108 --> 01:08:32.359
You're so mean!

01:08:32.526 --> 01:08:33.486
What the fuck?
I'm in a wheelchair!

01:08:33.569 --> 01:08:35.112
He's in a wheelchair!

01:08:35.196 --> 01:08:37.113
Hey, fat ass, we're going
to do your sister!

01:08:37.198 --> 01:08:38.407
I don't have a sister.

01:08:38.491 --> 01:08:39.700
In the ass!

01:08:41.202 --> 01:08:43.078
Blue dog left, Omaha!

01:08:47.124 --> 01:08:48.542
Yeah!
Yeah, brother!

01:08:48.626 --> 01:08:49.627
Shit.

01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:51.212
Why?

01:08:53.798 --> 01:08:54.881
You're such a fucking
embarrassment.

01:08:54.965 --> 01:08:56.685
Your father-in-law is a dick.

01:08:56.716 --> 01:08:58.761
- Oh, God, 72 just bit me!
- All right, that's it.

01:09:01.555 --> 01:09:02.890
Look at us.

01:09:04.265 --> 01:09:07.227
Where'd you go to defense
school, Munchkinland?

01:09:08.395 --> 01:09:09.979
Good one!

01:09:10.481 --> 01:09:13.067
Fuck this, fellows.
Shit just got real.

01:09:14.568 --> 01:09:16.278
Get up, guys.
We're about to give these

01:09:16.362 --> 01:09:18.781
old bitches a nice
little serving of youth.

01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:20.032
All right, ready!

01:09:20.115 --> 01:09:21.242
Set. Hike! Let's go!

01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:25.746
Go, go,
Dickerson! Yeah!

01:09:27.915 --> 01:09:29.124
Old bitch!

01:09:29.917 --> 01:09:31.752
Hut!

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:35.881
How does it feel?

01:09:37.091 --> 01:09:38.591
- Fuck!
- Hike! Let's go!

01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:40.344
Oh, God!

01:09:45.307 --> 01:09:46.642
Hut one.

01:09:46.725 --> 01:09:47.977
Fumble!

01:09:48.143 --> 01:09:50.020
I've got the ball!
I've got the ball!

01:09:50.104 --> 01:09:51.772
This way, Doug!

01:09:51.939 --> 01:09:53.691
This way!
I've got the ball!

01:09:53.774 --> 01:09:54.775
Go, go, go!

01:09:55.025 --> 01:09:56.694
Keep going!

01:10:05.786 --> 01:10:07.288
- Fumble!
- Fumble!

01:10:09.832 --> 01:10:11.292
Dog pile!

01:10:11.792 --> 01:10:14.295
Our ball! Our ball!
Our ball!

01:10:14.461 --> 01:10:16.672
Okay, listen, y'all.

01:10:18.549 --> 01:10:20.092
I'll be the first to say
that we underestimated

01:10:20.134 --> 01:10:21.552
these old sons of bitches.

01:10:21.635 --> 01:10:23.721
Listen! Right now,
we are back in the game.

01:10:23.804 --> 01:10:25.681
The next touchdown wins, guys.

01:10:25.973 --> 01:10:27.725
Now, Doug, I gotta be
honest with you, man.

01:10:27.808 --> 01:10:29.351
You played a pretty
shitty game.

01:10:29.476 --> 01:10:30.978
And the last thing
I want to do is put

01:10:31.061 --> 01:10:32.980
the ball in your hands,
but I do know this.

01:10:33.147 --> 01:10:34.627
I know that you're
faster than Big Ed.

01:10:34.648 --> 01:10:36.901
I know that I can
throw you the ball.

01:10:36.984 --> 01:10:39.704
But what I need to know is if you're
going to catch the goddamn ball.

01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:41.697
Hey, look at me.

01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:43.490
Please don't
throw me the ball.

01:10:43.574 --> 01:10:45.826
Doug, get off of me. OTIS: Man,
your father-in-law hates you.

01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:48.329
Listen, I will throw it to you and
you're going to catch it. Okay?

01:10:48.412 --> 01:10:49.413
Get some fucking
balls right now!

01:10:49.496 --> 01:10:50.496
You need this, Doug.

01:10:50.539 --> 01:10:52.333
Be a man. This
isn't a game anymore.

01:10:52.458 --> 01:10:54.793
- Your father-in-law has no respect for you.
- Show him you're a man.

01:10:54.877 --> 01:10:55.920
Be a goddamn man!

01:10:56.003 --> 01:10:57.671
- One, two, three.
- Break!

01:11:07.222 --> 01:11:08.390
Hike!

01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:54.728
Yeah!

01:12:04.905 --> 01:12:06.323
Oh, my God.

01:12:14.081 --> 01:12:16.125
How did you like
them apples?

01:12:16.208 --> 01:12:18.627
You can't spell "Ed"
without "Bitch"!

01:12:18.794 --> 01:12:20.963
Whoa. Easy there.
That's going to be your dad.

01:12:24.591 --> 01:12:26.468
I'm so happy
for you, man.

01:12:28.762 --> 01:12:30.097
You're not a bitch!

01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:36.562
I told you
guys to be careful.

01:12:36.645 --> 01:12:38.105
I knew someone would get hurt.
Look at this.

01:12:38.188 --> 01:12:39.690
Well, to be fair,
we were just having fun

01:12:39.773 --> 01:12:40.933
until your dad
and his friends

01:12:40.941 --> 01:12:42.693
decided to make it
an MMA blood sport.

01:12:42.776 --> 01:12:44.987
- Don't pin this shit on me.
- Hey, hey, now.

01:12:45.195 --> 01:12:46.447
Hey!

01:12:46.613 --> 01:12:48.574
Oh, my God. Who the
hell are those guys?

01:12:48.657 --> 01:12:50.617
What are you talking about?
Those are my friends.

01:12:50.701 --> 01:12:53.078
That's Principal
Mitchell Rambis from Utah.

01:12:53.495 --> 01:12:55.622
In the wheelchair,
that's Plunkett.

01:12:55.831 --> 01:12:58.792
And that's the brilliant
philosopher, Ira Drysdale.

01:12:59.126 --> 01:13:00.419
No. No, no.

01:13:00.502 --> 01:13:02.254
That's the strangest
looking group

01:13:02.337 --> 01:13:04.006
of guys I've ever
seen in my life.

01:13:04.089 --> 01:13:06.633
What do you mean? Those are my boys.
What's up, man?

01:13:06.717 --> 01:13:08.010
How are you doing, Doug?

01:13:08.093 --> 01:13:11.221
My, this has been a long
time coming, hasn't it?

01:13:11.305 --> 01:13:12.473
Palmers,
it's an honor.

01:13:12.556 --> 01:13:14.391
Mrs. Palmer, I see
where Gretchen gets her

01:13:14.475 --> 01:13:15.976
good looks.

01:13:16.685 --> 01:13:17.728
Thank you.

01:13:17.811 --> 01:13:19.396
Gretchen.
Yes.

01:13:20.397 --> 01:13:21.732
Oh.

01:13:22.483 --> 01:13:24.568
It's a pleasure finally meeting
the love of Doug's life.

01:13:24.651 --> 01:13:26.987
Thank you. Hey, Grandma...
What the...

01:13:27.071 --> 01:13:28.906
Oh, wait, Bic,
I meant to tell you,

01:13:28.989 --> 01:13:30.109
Grandma made
a full recovery.

01:13:30.115 --> 01:13:31.825
She's doing really well.
Doesn't she look good, guys?

01:13:32.159 --> 01:13:33.160
Yeah.

01:13:33.827 --> 01:13:36.580
That's something else to look at there.
It's very pretty.

01:13:41.668 --> 01:13:43.003
What are you doing?
Nothing.

01:13:43.253 --> 01:13:45.506
What are you feeding him? Oh,
what are you talking about?

01:13:47.674 --> 01:13:50.344
That. He wasn't like that
until you showed up.

01:13:52.012 --> 01:13:53.092
That's the Doug
that I know.

01:13:53.097 --> 01:13:54.556
I've never seen
that Doug before.

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:58.227
Hi, everyone.
Hi. I'm Holly Munk.

01:13:58.435 --> 01:13:59.937
I'm the head bridesmaid.

01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:01.480
Twenty bucks says
they wrote a song.

01:14:01.605 --> 01:14:03.774
$40 says it's The Carpenters.
You're on.

01:14:03.857 --> 01:14:04.900
You're on.

01:14:04.983 --> 01:14:05.983
You're onner.

01:14:06.026 --> 01:14:07.778
You're on first.
You're more on.

01:14:07.861 --> 01:14:10.280
You're on from God.

01:14:10.364 --> 01:14:11.657
You're never going to
believe this, Gretch,

01:14:11.782 --> 01:14:14.034
but we wrote you a little ditty.

01:14:14.535 --> 01:14:17.621
Yes. And if everyone wants
to look under your seats,

01:14:17.704 --> 01:14:18.914
you're going to
find the lyrics

01:14:18.997 --> 01:14:20.917
so that everybody can sing along.

01:14:21.125 --> 01:14:24.044
And we're singing
to the tune of

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:25.921
Lean on Me.

01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:27.297
Pay up, Father.

01:14:27.381 --> 01:14:28.799
I don't have any cash.
I only have credit.

01:14:28.882 --> 01:14:31.844
Do you take credit cards?
Oh, no, I only take cash.

01:14:31.927 --> 01:14:33.595
Oh, excuse me, Ms. Maid of Honor.
What?

01:14:33.679 --> 01:14:34.888
Are you going to chat
all night or are you

01:14:34.972 --> 01:14:36.515
going to come up
and sing with us?

01:14:36.557 --> 01:14:38.976
Do you think you're too good?
No, this is your guys' thing.

01:14:39.143 --> 01:14:40.144
What, do you
think you're too pretty?

01:14:40.227 --> 01:14:41.353
God always wins.

01:14:41.436 --> 01:14:43.689
That's why you're going up there.
God is a winner.

01:14:43.939 --> 01:14:45.899
Let's go, bitch. Come on.
I'm coming.

Since none of us
are songwriters,

01:15:29.151 --> 01:15:30.861
we decided to put together
a little slide show

01:15:30.944 --> 01:15:32.487
to toast our buddy.

01:15:32.696 --> 01:15:35.282
He was stealing ladies' hearts
since long before we knew him.

01:15:37.534 --> 01:15:39.369
His friendship
came with an instant

01:15:39.453 --> 01:15:41.330
half-point boost
to all our GPA's.

01:15:41.413 --> 01:15:43.207
You never could crack
2.5, Dickerson!

01:15:43.290 --> 01:15:44.625
You got me there,
buddy.

01:15:44.708 --> 01:15:45.959
He also taught us things

01:15:46.043 --> 01:15:47.753
that you can't learn
in a classroom.

01:15:47.836 --> 01:15:49.796
- Whether it was bowling at regionals.
- Aw.

01:15:50.839 --> 01:15:52.799
Running the Santa
Monica Marathon.

01:15:52.883 --> 01:15:54.301
It was a close
call with the Kenyan.

01:15:54.384 --> 01:15:55.552
You ran?
Yeah.

01:15:55.636 --> 01:15:58.639
Navigating the rapids
of Colorado.

01:15:59.181 --> 01:16:01.725
Scuba diving
the Great Barrier Reef.

01:16:01.808 --> 01:16:02.851
What?

01:16:02.976 --> 01:16:04.478
Climbing the glaciers

01:16:04.561 --> 01:16:05.771
of Patagonia.
Hmm.

01:16:08.315 --> 01:16:11.151
Jumping out of a plane at 10,000 feet.

01:16:14.821 --> 01:16:16.657
Help him out, guys.
You got it?

01:16:18.575 --> 01:16:19.576
Yeah.

01:16:19.993 --> 01:16:22.496
After I was hit
by a drunk driver

01:16:22.579 --> 01:16:24.373
who was found innocent,

01:16:26.333 --> 01:16:28.418
it was Doug
who helped me pay

01:16:28.502 --> 01:16:29.795
for my law school tuition.

01:16:29.878 --> 01:16:30.879
Aw.

01:16:31.004 --> 01:16:32.673
That's so sweet.

01:16:32.756 --> 01:16:33.840
It was you.

01:16:38.929 --> 01:16:39.972
That's okay.

01:16:40.055 --> 01:16:41.848
The only thing that
gets hard is my nipples.

01:16:42.015 --> 01:16:43.225
Oh, dear.

01:16:43.767 --> 01:16:45.352
Let's get him out of here.

01:16:45.435 --> 01:16:46.635
Way to keep it
together, buddy.

01:16:46.728 --> 01:16:47.813
I wanted to quit
grad school

01:16:47.896 --> 01:16:49.606
until Doug told me
the story of Plunkett.

01:16:49.856 --> 01:16:51.316
Which inspired me to stay.

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:52.440
- Aw.
- He inspired us all.

01:16:52.484 --> 01:16:54.736
When he wasn't
hitting those books,

01:16:54.861 --> 01:16:57.072
old Doug-town was teaching
us all how to have fun.

01:16:57.155 --> 01:16:58.782
- Yeah, he was.
Doug-man.

01:17:00.242 --> 01:17:01.785
I think we saved
the best for last.

01:17:01.868 --> 01:17:03.620
This last shot is
actually my favorite.

01:17:04.538 --> 01:17:07.624
This was a historic guy trip
with my closest friend.

01:17:07.791 --> 01:17:09.459
As you can see
in this picture

01:17:09.543 --> 01:17:10.711
and in all
the other pictures,

01:17:11.086 --> 01:17:13.130
Doug is smiling,

01:17:14.047 --> 01:17:15.924
but I think we can
all agree that in this shot,

01:17:16.008 --> 01:17:17.759
that smile got
a whole lot brighter.

01:17:19.219 --> 01:17:20.262
I love you, bud.

01:17:27.894 --> 01:17:30.522
I was a bit surprised
when I met your groomsmen.

01:17:30.605 --> 01:17:33.567
I mean, actually, terrified.
Like, "Wah! What is that?"

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:35.819
But I've got to say,
they're really good guys.

01:17:36.403 --> 01:17:37.821
Oops.

01:17:41.491 --> 01:17:43.243
Honey, are you there?

01:17:46.913 --> 01:17:49.113
I'm definitely going to
have Alison be my maid of honor.

01:17:49.124 --> 01:17:50.667
I mean, no one
can fight over that.

01:17:50.751 --> 01:17:53.253
But, babe, what about you? Who's
going to be your best man?

01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:54.504
Uh...

01:17:56.048 --> 01:17:58.967
Mitchum. Bic Mitchum.

01:17:59.426 --> 01:18:00.510
Who?

01:18:00.594 --> 01:18:02.679
You know Bic. Bic Mitchum.

01:18:02.929 --> 01:18:04.056
He's a buddy of mine
from Stanford.

01:18:04.139 --> 01:18:06.058
No, I've never heard
of Bic Mitchum.

01:18:06.433 --> 01:18:08.935
Didn't you meet Bic at that...
I met Bic?

01:18:09.019 --> 01:18:11.579
You know, maybe on second thought,
you didn't meet Bio because...

01:18:11.605 --> 01:18:13.815
Because why?
He's overseas,

01:18:13.899 --> 01:18:16.443
uh, in the military.

01:18:17.069 --> 01:18:20.072
Oh, you know what?
Now that you mention it...

01:18:20.155 --> 01:18:22.282
I think you have said
something about him.

01:18:22.366 --> 01:18:23.825
Isn't he a priest
or something?

01:18:24.618 --> 01:18:27.871
Yeah. That's right.
Yeah, I knew it.

01:18:27.954 --> 01:18:29.956
He's a priest overseas
in the military.

01:18:31.291 --> 01:18:33.251
But our
Wedding's in 10 days.

01:18:33.335 --> 01:18:34.503
But Bic's still in...

01:18:34.711 --> 01:18:37.381
Uh, El Salvador.

01:18:37.464 --> 01:18:38.632
Bic is flying in
tomorrow morning.

01:18:38.715 --> 01:18:40.384
In April I was in the Middle East.
Muffin juice.

01:18:40.467 --> 01:18:42.010
Bring him to lunch with you. No!

01:18:42.344 --> 01:18:43.970
I am...

01:18:44.054 --> 01:18:45.097
Oh, my God!

01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:46.932
...dying to
finally meet this guy.

01:18:49.267 --> 01:18:50.769
I'm dying to finally
meet all your friends.

01:18:50.811 --> 01:18:52.854
Who the hell are those guys?
Those are my friends.

01:18:52.979 --> 01:18:56.108
I am still missing the
groomsmen's information.

01:18:56.525 --> 01:18:57.651
Those are
the strangest group of guys

01:18:57.734 --> 01:18:58.985
I've ever seen in my life.

01:18:59.528 --> 01:19:00.570
Your friends
are gonna be there.

01:19:00.654 --> 01:19:01.974
My friends are
all gonna be there.

01:19:06.535 --> 01:19:07.911

Hey-Hon?

01:19:11.832 --> 01:19:12.916
Gretchen, are you there?

01:19:12.999 --> 01:19:14.000
Doug-

01:19:14.167 --> 01:19:15.919
Don't you think
it's a bit strange

01:19:16.002 --> 01:19:19.714
that you use Bic razors
and Mitchum deodorant,

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:22.509
and your best man's
name is Bic Mitchum?

01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:28.223
Well, if your best friend
was named Jemima Colgate,

01:19:28.306 --> 01:19:29.850
I bet you wouldn't
use Log Cabin syrup

01:19:29.933 --> 01:19:31.435
or Aquafresh toothpaste,
would you?

01:19:32.269 --> 01:19:33.854
It's called loyalty.

01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:36.440
Hey, sweetie, listen,
you're just overstressed.

01:19:36.606 --> 01:19:38.150
Why don't you get some sleep?
I'll see you tomorrow

01:19:38.233 --> 01:19:40.277
for our big day. Okay?

01:19:41.695 --> 01:19:42.988
Okay, bye.

01:19:43.071 --> 01:19:44.364

You just started
thinking that?

Well, I mean,
she's going to be my wife.

Shouldn't I be able

01:20:36.833 --> 01:20:38.293
I mean, the key

01:20:41.087 --> 01:20:44.257

her happy, Doug. All right?

Let's go get you married.

a Golden Tux was possible.

Which means that from this moment
on, we are flawless, gentlemen.

01:21:28.343 --> 01:21:29.427
Have each other's
backs out there.

01:21:29.511 --> 01:21:30.637
Support each other.

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:32.389
Remember your HW2's,
your boomerangs,

01:21:32.472 --> 01:21:33.807
and your Party Trick
Distractions.

01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:35.642
Drysdale, set it off.
What time is it?

01:21:35.725 --> 01:21:36.810
It's game time!

01:21:36.893 --> 01:21:38.144
I said,
what time is it?

01:21:38.228 --> 01:21:39.938
It's game time!

01:21:40.814 --> 01:21:42.649
Guys, guys,
I'm down here. Guys.

01:21:44.859 --> 01:21:46.987
Douglas! Hi!
Perfect timing.

01:21:47.070 --> 01:21:49.155
I was just telling
Papa Bear here

01:21:49.239 --> 01:21:52.284
that we did have a little
bit of a "scandal"

01:21:52.367 --> 01:21:53.827
with Father O'Brien.

01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:55.954
He will not be able to
officiate the wedding.

01:21:56.288 --> 01:21:57.368
But it's okay.
Rest assured,

01:21:57.414 --> 01:21:58.873
I have everything
under control

01:21:58.957 --> 01:22:00.750
because Father McNulty here,

01:22:00.834 --> 01:22:02.669
he has agreed to step

01:22:02.752 --> 01:22:04.588
as a replacement
of the shoes

01:22:04.671 --> 01:22:05.755
of Father O'Brien.

01:22:05.839 --> 01:22:07.841
Hello, Doug.
Hi. Great to meet you.

01:22:08.008 --> 01:22:10.218
Father McNulty is
a wonderful priest.

01:22:10.385 --> 01:22:12.429
I'm just happy the big day's finally
here, to be honest with you.

01:22:12.512 --> 01:22:13.805
I would love for you
to meet all my friends.

01:22:13.888 --> 01:22:15.181
This is my best man, Bic.

01:22:16.182 --> 01:22:20.186
Uh, Bic must have
gone a different way.

01:22:20.353 --> 01:22:21.938
Uh, would you guys mind
going to look for Bic?

01:22:22.022 --> 01:22:24.107
I'd love for him to be
caught up on all this.

01:22:24.274 --> 01:22:25.874
I'm going to go
see if he's praying.

01:22:26.401 --> 01:22:27.444
What is going on?

01:22:27.527 --> 01:22:28.653
What the hell is
Father McNulty doing here?

01:22:28.737 --> 01:22:30.071
How do you know
Father McNulty?

01:22:30.196 --> 01:22:31.781
Because he was my principal
at Benjamin Rush.

01:22:31.865 --> 01:22:34.117
I spent half my damn middle school
years in his principal's office.

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:36.453
Please, please tell me
that you are kidding me.

01:22:36.536 --> 01:22:38.913
This cannot be happening right now.
I need you to fix this.

01:22:38.997 --> 01:22:40.040
What you want me to do?
If I go out there,

01:22:40.123 --> 01:22:41.458
he knows I'm not
Bic Mitchum.

01:22:41.541 --> 01:22:45.045
Shh! Wait. Wait.
I think I have an idea.

01:22:53.053 --> 01:22:54.888
Father McNulty?
Yes.

01:22:56.306 --> 01:22:57.557
Go, go, go.

01:23:01.561 --> 01:23:02.729
Oh, shit!

01:23:02.896 --> 01:23:04.481
200 grand out the door,

01:23:04.564 --> 01:23:06.900
I expect...
No, I demand perfection.

01:23:06.983 --> 01:23:08.485
Yes, Mr. Palmer,
I assure you...

01:23:08.568 --> 01:23:09.944
Listen, Menudo,
first you tell me

01:23:10.028 --> 01:23:11.655
my family priest
is a goddamn pervert.

01:23:11.738 --> 01:23:13.907
Now you tell me Father
McNulty has disappeared.

01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:15.825
Mr. Palmer,
I'll take care of this.

01:23:15.909 --> 01:23:17.702
You better or I will
fuck you up.

01:23:56.658 --> 01:23:57.992
Shall we do this?

01:23:59.619 --> 01:24:02.372
Do you, Gretchen Palmer,

01:24:02.622 --> 01:24:06.418
take Douglas Ephraim
Ben Lazar Menahem Harris

01:24:06.626 --> 01:24:08.670
to be your lawfully
wedded husband,

01:24:09.003 --> 01:24:11.339
to have and to hold,

01:24:11.673 --> 01:24:14.050
through sickness
and health,

01:24:14.134 --> 01:24:15.301
till death do you part?

01:24:15.468 --> 01:24:16.469
I do.

01:24:18.221 --> 01:24:23.059
Do you, Douglas Ephraim
Ben Lazar Menahem Harris,

01:24:23.143 --> 01:24:24.728
take Gretchen Palmer

01:24:24.811 --> 01:24:26.271
to be your lawfully
wedded wife,

01:24:27.188 --> 01:24:29.858
to have and to hold,

01:24:30.233 --> 01:24:33.486
through sickness and health,
till death do you part?

01:24:35.238 --> 01:24:36.281
I do.

01:24:43.163 --> 01:24:46.207
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

01:24:46.624 --> 01:24:48.835
You
may now kiss the bride.

01:24:50.336 --> 01:24:53.381
Aw. Ladies and
gentlemen, I present to you

01:24:53.465 --> 01:24:55.341
Mr. and Mrs. Harris.

01:24:59.554 --> 01:25:01.306
You are about to
blow that back out.

01:25:01.389 --> 01:25:02.766
Don't do this here.
Don't do that.

01:25:02.849 --> 01:25:04.184
What?
Nothing.

01:25:11.024 --> 01:25:13.234
I'm a lounge singer myself
up there in Canada.

01:25:13.318 --> 01:25:14.402
What kind of
stuff do you sing?

01:25:14.486 --> 01:25:17.030
That's when I knew I was
born to work on feet.

01:25:17.363 --> 01:25:19.741
You're a podiatrist?
I'm a podiatrist.

01:25:24.662 --> 01:25:25.705
Big deal.

01:25:25.789 --> 01:25:27.040
Where did you
go to school?

01:25:27.207 --> 01:25:28.208
Uh...

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.251
You don't remember?

01:25:30.627 --> 01:25:32.170
Harvard.
I went to Harvard.

01:25:32.253 --> 01:25:34.293
I'm really inspired by black,
American soul singers.

01:25:34.297 --> 01:25:35.632
Nice.
Like Tom Jones.

01:25:35.882 --> 01:25:37.522
You went to Harvard Podiatry School?
Yeah.

01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:39.219
What years?
20.

01:25:39.302 --> 01:25:40.386
20?

01:25:43.223 --> 01:25:45.475
Oh, wow.
You work out, huh?

01:25:45.558 --> 01:25:46.810
Isn't Tom Jones white?

01:25:46.893 --> 01:25:48.228
Yeah, isn't he
from Wales?

01:25:51.231 --> 01:25:52.565
Mom!

01:25:52.732 --> 01:25:54.234
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Oh, my God.

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.736
- Well, do you want to see?
- Boom.

01:25:56.903 --> 01:25:58.863
Yeah, three balls.
Count them.

01:26:01.032 --> 01:26:02.659
I thought you said
you was a vegan.

01:26:05.370 --> 01:26:06.871
Okay, that's cool.

01:26:06.955 --> 01:26:08.623
I can do it, too.
Stop.

01:26:09.916 --> 01:26:10.916
That's mine.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.002
I'm proud of you, Doug. I really am.
Well, thank you, sir.

01:26:13.086 --> 01:26:14.712
I have to say,
I learned from the master.

01:26:14.796 --> 01:26:16.631
Hey, well,
don't celebrate yet.

01:26:16.714 --> 01:26:18.633
We still have
more work to do.

01:26:18.716 --> 01:26:20.476
All right, I'm going
to wait for you outside.

01:26:21.553 --> 01:26:23.513
Ugh. Can you believe this zipper
already broke? Okay, I'm coming.

01:26:23.596 --> 01:26:26.116
Mrs. Harris, can I talk to you for
a second? I'll get the thing.

01:26:26.266 --> 01:26:28.434
Uh, listen,
I may be partial here,

01:26:28.518 --> 01:26:29.727
but I just want to say
that you have put on

01:26:29.811 --> 01:26:31.020
the perfect wedding.
Really.

01:26:31.104 --> 01:26:32.397
Perfect wedding?

01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:35.066
The zipper on my
$8,000 dress is broken,

01:26:35.191 --> 01:26:36.943
the groomsmen are
accosting my bridesmaids,

01:26:37.026 --> 01:26:39.821
my grandmother's burned from head
to toe, my dad's knee is shredded.

01:26:39.904 --> 01:26:41.944
And don't even get me started
on the salad dressing.

01:26:42.574 --> 01:26:45.285
But at least you have Doug.
True love conquers all.

01:26:45.410 --> 01:26:46.619
True love?

01:26:46.703 --> 01:26:49.122
Please. I'm just sick
of dating assholes.

01:26:49.205 --> 01:26:51.499
Doug is a good guy,
he's good family material.

01:26:51.583 --> 01:26:52.625
What can I say?
I'm a girl

01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:54.043
that's used to a certain
kind of lifestyle,

01:26:54.127 --> 01:26:55.461
and Doug can give me
that kind of lifestyle.

01:26:55.545 --> 01:26:57.463
So, I've gotta go.

01:27:01.926 --> 01:27:04.262
Bud, are you waiting on me?
Yeah. Yes.

01:27:05.805 --> 01:27:07.891
Let's, uh, get back out there, huh?
Yeah.

01:27:07.974 --> 01:27:10.268
Time for the first dance.
Yes, it is.

01:27:12.979 --> 01:27:17.775
♪ You are so beautiful

01:27:22.238 --> 01:27:23.948
♪ To me

01:27:26.659 --> 01:27:31.664

Will the rest of
the wedding party

01:27:40.173 --> 01:27:42.425
please join the happy couple?

♪ You're everything

01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:54.562
♪ You're everything I need

01:27:57.023 --> 01:27:58.608
So, who are you really?

01:27:58.691 --> 01:28:00.193
I'm not sure I know
what you mean by that.

01:28:00.276 --> 01:28:02.904
There has just been some
questionable behavior

01:28:02.987 --> 01:28:04.781
over the last
couple of days.

01:28:04.864 --> 01:28:07.200
Like you setting my
grandmother on fire. Oh.

01:28:07.617 --> 01:28:09.369
The secret military codes.
Mmm-hmm.

01:28:09.452 --> 01:28:11.120
"Kitchen cabinets."

01:28:11.704 --> 01:28:13.790
What you have to understand
is that the Lord works

01:28:13.873 --> 01:28:15.124
in mysterious ways.

01:28:15.208 --> 01:28:16.709
And he thanketh...

01:28:16.793 --> 01:28:18.419
I don't know
about the Lord.

01:28:18.503 --> 01:28:21.214
You work in
mysterious ways.

Thank you.

01:28:32.642 --> 01:28:35.061

We got to talk.

♪ It's only a paper moon ♪

01:28:39.691 --> 01:28:41.091
What's the problem?
What's going on?

01:28:41.109 --> 01:28:42.485
I think I made
a terrible mistake.

01:28:42.819 --> 01:28:44.946
Gretchen doesn't love me.
She never has.

01:28:45.029 --> 01:28:46.864
Stop it. Stop.
Of course, she loves you.

01:28:47.073 --> 01:28:48.449
Why would you even say that?

01:28:48.533 --> 01:28:50.368
I overheard the two of you
talking, okay?

01:28:52.745 --> 01:28:55.415
Okay, listen. Maybe she's
confused, or she has the jitters.

01:28:55.498 --> 01:28:57.698
That's perfectly normal for a
woman at this stage, Doug.

01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:59.335
You have to understand that.
It doesn't matter.

01:28:59.419 --> 01:29:00.920
I don't love her, either.

01:29:01.212 --> 01:29:03.047
I love the idea that
a girl who looks that hot

01:29:03.131 --> 01:29:04.507
could like me.

01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:07.510
I couldn't believe it. But
she's not "the one," Jimmy.

01:29:07.593 --> 01:29:08.928
She's not even
"the two"

01:29:09.012 --> 01:29:10.304
or "the three,"
for that matter.

01:29:10.555 --> 01:29:11.973
Doug, nine days ago,
you came to me

01:29:12.056 --> 01:29:13.433
and you asked me
to pull off a miracle.

01:29:13.516 --> 01:29:14.517
Right now,
we're 30 minutes away

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:15.760
from pulling off
a Golden Tux.

01:29:15.768 --> 01:29:17.353
I know. But then what?

01:29:17.437 --> 01:29:19.022
Then I go back to
living what turns out

01:29:19.105 --> 01:29:21.649
was a pretty lonely life. I
don't want that life anymore.

01:29:22.108 --> 01:29:23.526
I don't want to be that guy.

01:29:23.609 --> 01:29:24.944
Doug, you have to
calm down.

01:29:25.028 --> 01:29:26.237
Everything is going
to be all right.

01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:28.865
I don't want it
to be all right.

01:29:28.948 --> 01:29:30.616
I want it to be great.

01:29:30.783 --> 01:29:32.744
I want my real life to be

01:29:32.827 --> 01:29:34.370
as fun as the one I paid for.

01:29:34.454 --> 01:29:36.539
No shit, Doug.

01:29:36.622 --> 01:29:38.458
You don't think
I want that? Hmm?

01:29:38.916 --> 01:29:41.044
You don't think I want to
be a Delta Air Line pilot

01:29:41.127 --> 01:29:42.336
or the CFO of Lubriderm

01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:43.921
or whatever the hell
else I made up,

01:29:44.005 --> 01:29:46.841
instead of being some guy that works
out of a renovated fucking closet?

01:29:46.924 --> 01:29:48.009
You don't think
I would ask Alison

01:29:48.092 --> 01:29:49.612
to come out and have
a burrito with me?

01:29:49.635 --> 01:29:51.304
Me? With Jimmy Callahan?

01:29:51.387 --> 01:29:53.473
Or say, "Hey, Doug, come on,
let's go have a beer next week."

01:29:53.639 --> 01:29:54.807
"Maybe we can catch a game."

01:29:54.891 --> 01:29:57.102
I want to do all of
that shit, but I can't.

01:29:57.185 --> 01:29:59.065
Because I can't go out
there and tell the truth.

01:29:59.145 --> 01:30:01.189
Because you need Bic.

01:30:03.274 --> 01:30:04.734
Nobody needs Jimmy, man.

01:30:04.817 --> 01:30:08.112
Okay? Not a single soul
needs Jimmy.

01:30:08.613 --> 01:30:10.990
That's reality, Doug.

01:30:11.324 --> 01:30:13.576
I'm going to go out here and
I'm going to make my toast,

01:30:13.659 --> 01:30:15.244
and me and you,
we are done here.

01:30:15.328 --> 01:30:17.288
We're done.

01:30:17.371 --> 01:30:19.540
I suggest you get your
head back in the game.

01:30:19.624 --> 01:30:21.000
It's showtime.

01:30:27.673 --> 01:30:31.135
♪ If you believed in me ♪

01:30:32.136 --> 01:30:34.806
Good evening. My name
is Bic Mitchum,

01:30:34.889 --> 01:30:36.224
and, uh,
I just want to say

01:30:36.307 --> 01:30:38.184
that it's an honor
to be here.

01:30:38.643 --> 01:30:40.144
I've delivered many sermons,

01:30:40.228 --> 01:30:41.813
but never
a best man's speech,

01:30:41.896 --> 01:30:43.189
so, please bear with me.

01:30:44.607 --> 01:30:46.234
Doug and I have been
through a lot together.

01:30:46.317 --> 01:30:48.778
Happy times and sad.

01:30:48.861 --> 01:30:50.113
When I was accepted
into the priesthood,

01:30:50.196 --> 01:30:52.615
Doug was there waiting
for me with a huge hug

01:30:52.698 --> 01:30:55.118
and a Bible that was
signed by Cardinal Enders.

01:30:55.201 --> 01:30:56.953
And when his parents,
Merle and Irene,

01:30:57.036 --> 01:30:58.704
passed,
God rest their souls,

01:30:59.372 --> 01:31:00.581
I cried as if
they were my own.

01:31:01.791 --> 01:31:03.459
You know, my grandmother
once told me

01:31:03.543 --> 01:31:06.712
that the true measure
of friendship isn't...

01:31:08.214 --> 01:31:10.550
Isn't how you feel
about someone else.

01:31:12.718 --> 01:31:16.055
It's about how they make
you feel about yourself.

01:31:18.349 --> 01:31:19.475
And, uh...

01:31:20.685 --> 01:31:23.813
I can honestly say that
I've never had a friend

01:31:23.896 --> 01:31:26.399
to make me feel the way
that you have, Doug.

01:31:29.235 --> 01:31:30.903
Uh...

01:31:36.576 --> 01:31:37.660
Um...

01:31:45.418 --> 01:31:47.044
I'm sorry. Uh...

01:31:50.548 --> 01:31:54.093
When Doug called me and told
me that he wanted to propose,

01:31:56.012 --> 01:31:59.849
I was nervous. I was probably
just as nervous as he was.

01:32:01.017 --> 01:32:03.102
And I remember asking him,

01:32:04.854 --> 01:32:06.939
"Are you sure
she's 'the one'?"

01:32:12.737 --> 01:32:13.738
Damn it.

01:32:16.115 --> 01:32:17.158
He told me he, uh...

01:32:17.241 --> 01:32:18.242
Stop!

01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:23.080
What are you doing?
Just, uh, stop.

01:32:25.291 --> 01:32:26.792
I don't know.

01:32:27.376 --> 01:32:28.669
Doug.

01:32:33.132 --> 01:32:34.425
What are you doing, Doug?

01:32:34.508 --> 01:32:37.136
Are you sure that you want
to go through with this?

01:32:37.303 --> 01:32:39.305
Thanks, Jimmy.
I've got it from here.

01:32:41.349 --> 01:32:45.019
Hi. I've got
something to say.

01:32:45.937 --> 01:32:48.147
None of this is real.

01:32:48.356 --> 01:32:49.690
Ooh.
Uh-oh.

01:32:50.608 --> 01:32:51.776
What?

01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:54.654
See, although
the flowers are beautiful

01:32:54.737 --> 01:32:57.490
and the salad
dressing is great,

01:32:57.823 --> 01:32:59.116
we're not married,

01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:00.826
Gretchen and I.

01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:02.160
We can't be

01:33:02.203 --> 01:33:04.789
because my friend Bic
is not a priest.

01:33:05.581 --> 01:33:06.916
Oh, shit, here we go.

01:33:06.999 --> 01:33:08.918
Yeah. In fact, he's not
even in the Army.

01:33:09.001 --> 01:33:10.503
His real name is Jimmy,

01:33:10.586 --> 01:33:12.296
and I hired him
to be my best man

01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:14.257
because I had
no other options.

01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:15.800
Same with all my groomsmen.

01:33:15.883 --> 01:33:18.261
I actually don't even know
their real last names.

01:33:18.344 --> 01:33:19.929
Bronstein.
...is Japanese.

01:33:20.096 --> 01:33:22.265
It's good to meet you guys.
So, please stay

01:33:22.348 --> 01:33:23.933
and enjoy the cake.

01:33:26.018 --> 01:33:27.103
What do we do now?

01:33:27.186 --> 01:33:28.437
We need to get
the fuck out of here.

01:33:28.521 --> 01:33:29.605
Yeah.
Great stuff tonight.

01:33:29.689 --> 01:33:30.731
Thank you so much, bud.

01:33:31.357 --> 01:33:33.401
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

01:33:35.861 --> 01:33:37.280
Look, Gretch,
who were we kidding?

01:33:37.363 --> 01:33:39.123
You didn't grow up
dreaming of a guy like me.

01:33:39.198 --> 01:33:41.659
Your knight is out there somewhere.
Go find him.

01:33:41.826 --> 01:33:43.577
I'm going to
tear your head off.

01:33:43.828 --> 01:33:45.955
You goddamn motherfucking
pathetic piece of shit.

01:33:46.038 --> 01:33:47.707
Señor, let's just relax. Get
out of my way, you fairy.

01:33:47.790 --> 01:33:49.030
Fairy?

01:33:52.169 --> 01:33:54.171
- Love you, Dougie!
- Calm down.

01:33:54.463 --> 01:33:56.173
You motherfuckers!

01:33:56.257 --> 01:33:57.883
I swear to God...

01:34:02.346 --> 01:34:03.472
What the fuck?

01:34:03.556 --> 01:34:04.890
I will cut you!

01:34:05.641 --> 01:34:06.726
Shit, man.

01:34:07.351 --> 01:34:09.979
Good game, kid. That
was a hell of a catch.

01:34:10.062 --> 01:34:11.063
Oh.

01:34:11.188 --> 01:34:12.189
All right. Thanks.

01:34:12.648 --> 01:34:14.775
Hey. No ass-touching
off the field, Joe.

01:34:14.859 --> 01:34:16.485
I knew you were
full of shit

01:34:16.569 --> 01:34:17.778
from the moment I met you.

01:34:17.862 --> 01:34:19.864
I know this is gonna sound crazy,
but if you're ever in the mood,

01:34:19.947 --> 01:34:21.282
I know a place that
has great burritos.

01:34:21.365 --> 01:34:22.491
You just ruined
my sister's wedding

01:34:22.575 --> 01:34:23.784
and you're asking me
out on a date?

01:34:23.868 --> 01:34:25.244
Yes, I am.
Can I call you?

01:34:26.912 --> 01:34:28.247
Yeah, you better.
I will.

01:34:28.748 --> 01:34:29.749
Oh.

01:34:35.629 --> 01:34:37.548
We were
this close, Doug.

01:34:37.631 --> 01:34:39.175
Yeah, well,
maybe next time.

01:34:39.342 --> 01:34:40.343
Yeah.

01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:41.761
Oh.

01:34:42.053 --> 01:34:43.054
Here.

01:34:44.847 --> 01:34:46.390
You saved me, Jimmy.

01:34:46.474 --> 01:34:48.184
Yeah, well,
you saved me, too.

01:34:48.434 --> 01:34:50.227
Did you mean what
you said back there?

01:34:51.604 --> 01:34:52.646
Am I really your friend?

01:34:53.314 --> 01:34:54.690
Yeah, of course I meant it.

01:34:56.442 --> 01:34:58.319
Does that mean you
don't want my money?

01:34:58.402 --> 01:35:00.654
Fuck yeah, I want this money.
I earned this money, man.

01:35:00.738 --> 01:35:01.864
Damn it.

01:35:01.947 --> 01:35:03.616
So, what the hell
do we do now?

01:35:03.783 --> 01:35:05.868
You still have those two first-class
tickets for your honeymoon?

01:35:05.951 --> 01:35:07.787
Yeah, why?
I've got an idea.

01:35:08.287 --> 01:35:11.332
This is going to be the best
honeymoon ever!

01:35:11.582 --> 01:35:13.626
Ever honeymoon best
the be to going is this!

01:35:13.959 --> 01:35:15.002
Cheers, my friend.

01:35:20.299 --> 01:35:22.301
I need you to
take your seats.

01:35:22.468 --> 01:35:24.303
Please fasten
your seat belts.

01:35:24.929 --> 01:35:26.806
Can I unfasten
my pants belt?

01:35:27.264 --> 01:35:28.391
Oh.

01:35:30.184 --> 01:35:31.894
Oh, hello. Would you mind
holding this for a second?

01:35:31.977 --> 01:35:33.729
Yes, Doug.
Thank you so much.

01:35:33.813 --> 01:35:35.272
Oh, no. Okay.

01:35:35.564 --> 01:35:36.565
Oh.

01:35:40.653 --> 01:35:42.905
Oh! Hi, there!

don't you?

01:35:46.117 --> 01:35:48.077
Is that a dog? You can't
have a dog on the plane.

01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:49.286
This? No,
it's a service dog.

01:35:49.370 --> 01:35:50.746
That's a service dog, man.

01:35:50.830 --> 01:35:52.081
Let me show you what type
of service it can do.

01:35:52.415 --> 01:35:53.582
