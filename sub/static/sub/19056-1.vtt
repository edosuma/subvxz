00:56.156 --> 00:58.290
Could we have a look
inside, sir?

00:58.292 --> 01:00.292
Uh, no word from them then?

01:00.294 --> 01:04.063
Nothing. This is the last
place that they were seen.

01:04.065 --> 01:06.265
We'd prefer to come inside,
if that's all right, sir.

01:06.267 --> 01:09.501
Well, always happy
to help if I can.

01:20.780 --> 01:23.749
Henry: We only ever
heard arguments
coming from their room.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.551
Was there any acts
of violence?

01:25.553 --> 01:28.253
Um, no, but he had
a very short temper.

01:28.255 --> 01:31.190
But she was lovely,
a proper lady.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.092
One sugar or two, dear?

01:33.094 --> 01:34.359
Two, please.

01:34.361 --> 01:36.395
Did they give any hints
of where they were going?

01:36.397 --> 01:39.498
Henry: No, but they'd paid
their rent in full and left.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.734
Last time you said
you didn't speak to them.
They just left in a rush.

01:42.736 --> 01:45.070
Him.
We didn't speak to him.

01:45.072 --> 01:48.607
But she apologized and
paid the month's rent
before leaving.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.776
That is not what
you said before.
Do you have a rent book?

01:50.778 --> 01:52.177
Of course.

01:54.714 --> 02:00.018
It is such a shame,
young couples seem
so impatient these days.

02:00.020 --> 02:02.354
They want everything
yesterday, rather than

02:02.356 --> 02:04.823
trying to build
a proper life over time.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.300
Hmm.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.669
Wait. Let me have a look.

02:23.443 --> 02:26.245
Detective McQueen:
Is that her signature?
Jason: Yes.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.648
But they didn't
have any money.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.484
It clearly says that
they're paid up there.
That's all in order.

02:32.486 --> 02:36.255
But they couldn't have done,
because they didn't
have any money.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.823
We're sorry to have
disturbed you.

02:37.825 --> 02:41.827
Oh, it's okay. We understand.
We are worried about them
as well.

02:41.829 --> 02:41.827
Henry: Especially Jill.

02:41.829 --> 02:49.468
I mean, there is no telling
what somebody mad in the head
like Marcus might do.

02:49.470 --> 02:53.472
Well, you said so yourself.
When you came to speak
to us before.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.974
We will see
ourselves out.
Oh...

02:55.976 --> 02:57.709
I hope you find them.

02:57.711 --> 03:00.546
Get Jill away from
that troubled young man.

03:01.814 --> 03:03.182
Thanks.

03:21.334 --> 03:23.202
Josephine: Stop shaking.

03:26.873 --> 03:29.408
You need
to take your pills.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.944
I need you
to be strong
for all three of us.

04:40.246 --> 04:42.281
Marcus: <i> Right.</i>

04:42.283 --> 04:44.650
<i> I'm going to tell you</i>
<i> a true story.</i>

04:44.652 --> 04:49.321
My mates' nan was
scheduled to go
for a smear test.

04:49.323 --> 04:51.723
I know what you're thinking,
but stick with me,

04:51.725 --> 04:52.991
'cause it gets better.

04:52.993 --> 04:56.328
And she thought she needed
to be, uh, presentable.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.163
You know, downstairs.

04:58.165 --> 05:00.399
So she sneaks into her
granddaughter's room

05:00.401 --> 05:03.235
and sprays a can of deodorant.

05:03.237 --> 05:07.372
Not realizing that it wasn't
actually the sweet smell
of the summer forest

05:07.374 --> 05:12.944
but a can of glitter that
her granddaughter
had kept from a party.

05:12.946 --> 05:16.615
So the granny goes along
to the gynecologist
and she spreads her legs.

05:16.617 --> 05:19.518
And the guy
is fucking speechless

05:19.520 --> 05:23.155
because in front of him
is a 67-year-old woman

05:23.157 --> 05:26.024
whose vagina
is fucking glittering.

05:26.026 --> 05:30.162
Coming at him, you know.
Proper disco pussy, yeah.

05:30.164 --> 05:33.398
Ah, no, no, I'm joking.
I'm joking.

05:33.400 --> 05:38.670
His nan has not got
a glittering vagina nor is
the gynecologist my dad.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.173
Uh, thank you very much,
ladies and gentleman.

05:41.175 --> 05:43.575
I have been Marcus Crowe.

05:55.321 --> 05:56.788
Where were you?
Sorry I'm late.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.658
My new boss wouldn't
let me out early.

05:59.660 --> 06:03.929
Well, you tell that cocksucker
that your boyfriend
is doing a gig.

06:03.931 --> 06:06.765
Come on, that call center
is comedy gold for you.

06:08.134 --> 06:09.701
Have they paid you?

06:10.370 --> 06:11.737
Oh, mark.

06:11.739 --> 06:15.741
Look, if I keep asking
for money, I won't get
any more gigs.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.075
It's a free bar.

06:17.077 --> 06:20.212
We have to view that
house tomorrow morning.
We can't get drunk.

06:20.214 --> 06:22.381
We could always squat
somewhere.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.287
Guess my jokes
are a bit off today.

06:29.289 --> 06:30.922
One drink.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.691
Same?
Yes, please.

06:36.095 --> 06:38.029
Mark!
Great job tonight, mate.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.264
Glittering vaginas.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.766
Loved it.
Thanks, mate.

06:40.768 --> 06:43.001
Hey, Jill. Yup.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.437
Bartender: Cheers.
Thanks.

06:53.946 --> 06:56.481
Damn it, babe.

06:57.183 --> 06:59.017
I'm trying to write here.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.587
So, could you please...

07:06.392 --> 07:08.493
Shut the fuck up.

07:15.134 --> 07:16.735
<i> Shut the fuck up.</i>

07:42.295 --> 07:45.530
Hello. You must be the couple
we spoke to over the phone.

07:45.532 --> 07:48.099
Hi, I'm Jill.
This is my boyfriend, Marcus.

07:48.101 --> 07:49.668
Please, do come in.

08:00.346 --> 08:03.248
Henry,
this is Jill and Marcus.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.116
They have come
to see the room.

08:05.118 --> 08:09.254
It's the one upstairs.
Second room on the left.
It's open.

08:10.256 --> 08:11.690
Thank you.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.829
They look like Nazis.

08:17.831 --> 08:21.500
Shh. Best behavior.
We need this place.

08:26.772 --> 08:29.074
I like it.
What do you think?

08:30.176 --> 08:31.676
Um...

08:32.712 --> 08:35.145
I don't know. It's a bit...
Listen.

08:35.148 --> 08:36.481
It's just a temporary thing.

08:36.482 --> 08:38.984
Six to nine months
and we'll be out of here.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.159
Jill: <i> Do you mind me asking,</i>
<i> why no one has taken it yet?</i>

08:48.161 --> 08:50.996
It's just that the location
and the house are amazing.

08:50.998 --> 08:54.232
Yes, my wife and I want
the right person.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.067
We think you will
be perfect, though.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.569
Don't we, Henry?
Hmm.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.704
We need a decision today.

09:02.809 --> 09:05.076
- What?
- Nothing.

09:06.946 --> 09:10.482
Would you like to
look at the room again
before deciding?

09:10.484 --> 09:12.183
Thanks.
That would be great.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.655
It's Jill, isn't it?

09:17.356 --> 09:18.990
I hope you say yes.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.838
It's a steal, this location
for that amount of money.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.408
We'd be crazy not to take it.

09:36.410 --> 09:40.745
I don't know.
That old couple were a bit
full on.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.414
It's called being nice.

09:42.416 --> 09:45.483
You don't have to be
so guarded off-stage as well
as on-stage, you know.

09:45.485 --> 09:47.085
What is that
meant to mean?

09:47.087 --> 09:50.088
Think of all the new material
you could get done
in the quiet here.

09:50.090 --> 09:55.260
Look, I get the impression
that they want to adopt us.

09:55.262 --> 09:58.430
And I've spent years
getting out from underneath
one set of parents.

09:58.432 --> 10:01.366
I don't need a substitute.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.401
They are probably
just lonely.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.036
That old man kept
staring at me.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.072
Perhaps he fancies you.
I'm serious.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.708
So am I.

10:09.710 --> 10:13.678
It is impossible
not to find your lost
little-boy routine adorable.

10:16.515 --> 10:18.950
Did you hear a baby cry?

10:18.952 --> 10:23.421
No. Stop looking
for excuses.

10:23.423 --> 10:27.359
I need you to be more
responsible with what's
going on, mark.

10:27.361 --> 10:30.328
You've got to face
the fact that we don't
have any money.

10:32.064 --> 10:36.067
I'm not asking you
to get a job.

10:36.069 --> 10:39.404
I'm not asking you
to stop your comedy.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.539
I'm the one making
sacrifices for us.

10:41.541 --> 10:46.044
Now you do this for me.
You've got to trust me.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.813
Yeah, but a shared house
with a bunch of...

10:48.815 --> 10:50.815
...Coffin Dodgers.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.752
Blackmail.

10:54.253 --> 10:55.754
I love it.

10:57.690 --> 11:00.191
I like her, Henry.

11:01.293 --> 11:02.894
I agree.

11:03.829 --> 11:06.064
He will be a problem.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.268
I'm worried we're running
out of time, Henry.

11:11.003 --> 11:13.304
We will be okay.

11:17.576 --> 11:20.278
Jill: It's like a nuclear bomb
hit your side.

11:23.716 --> 11:25.350
Here, let me.

11:25.352 --> 11:31.756
I've never known someone
to find even the littlest
things so difficult.

11:31.758 --> 11:34.059
I wonder how we met,
let alone dated.

11:34.061 --> 11:39.164
We dated because
i bribed you with
my superior cooking prowess.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.702
Starter, main, dessert.

11:44.870 --> 11:48.039
You are about to enjoy
my three-course meal skills.

11:48.340 --> 11:49.874
Excellent.

11:54.346 --> 11:55.880
Thanks.

11:56.749 --> 11:59.217
What for?
For agreeing to do this.

12:00.986 --> 12:03.888
Did I have a choice?
No, you didn't.

12:16.135 --> 12:17.402
Henry.

12:26.445 --> 12:28.847
Got a third leg
hanging here, babe.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.687
Sorry. We were unpacking.

12:35.689 --> 12:37.956
Um, my wife and I would like

12:37.958 --> 12:40.658
to invite you both
down to dinner.

12:40.660 --> 12:43.194
A welcome hello.
If you don't mind.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.963
Marcus: Um,
that's very kind, but...

12:44.965 --> 12:46.464
Just give us a minute.

13:02.681 --> 13:05.884
You don't have to
do this, Josephine.
We just had some food.

13:05.886 --> 13:11.055
Oh, you young ones
are always having junk.
Eat good food for a change.

13:11.057 --> 13:13.958
Thanks. That's very
kind of you both.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.861
Do you not say grace
before eating?

13:26.206 --> 13:30.842
Thank you, o lord,
for these bounteous gifts

13:30.844 --> 13:34.145
received from your table.

13:34.147 --> 13:39.083
In the name of our savior,
Jesus Christ, our lord.

13:39.451 --> 13:40.952
Amen.

13:48.260 --> 13:52.263
Do either of you work?
Must cost a lot to maintain
this house.

13:53.232 --> 13:54.799
We're both retired.

13:54.801 --> 13:59.003
The extra money
from the room comes in
very handy for daily things.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.672
Did you take
your pills, dear?

14:00.674 --> 14:02.307
Yes, I did.

14:02.309 --> 14:05.143
Do you guys, um,
ever go out anywhere?

14:05.744 --> 14:08.279
No, we stay at home mostly,

14:08.281 --> 14:12.717
but it is a very safe
environment here.

14:12.719 --> 14:16.020
Henry is a real home boy.

14:16.488 --> 14:17.989
Marcus is, too.

14:19.291 --> 14:22.160
Well, then maybe we could
do some stuff together.

14:25.497 --> 14:29.634
Yeah. Sure.
Whatever you need.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.371
Eat up, dear.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.206
Oh, that's too much food.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.842
I won't have to eat
for a week.

14:37.844 --> 14:41.880
Um, it's manners
to wait to be served.

14:43.782 --> 14:45.617
What do you do for work?

14:46.919 --> 14:50.421
I'm a stand-up comedian.
I do gigs.

14:51.290 --> 14:54.726
Oh, so you let
your woman go out

14:54.728 --> 14:57.595
and earn a wage
and get a proper job.

14:57.597 --> 14:58.930
Henry.

14:58.932 --> 15:01.532
No. No, it's all right.

15:01.534 --> 15:05.970
I've always wanted more
than just a nine-to-five.

15:05.972 --> 15:10.008
And stand-up comedy
is the new rock and roll.

15:12.411 --> 15:15.613
I'm happy to support Marcus.
He is very good.

15:15.615 --> 15:17.882
His routine needs
a little Polish,
but he's coming around.

15:17.884 --> 15:22.487
There is nothing wrong
with my routine. It's just,
she doesn't find it funny.

15:22.489 --> 15:25.790
What about you, dear?
What are your dreams?

15:25.792 --> 15:28.192
Um...

15:28.194 --> 15:31.529
Earn enough money to go
traveling and see the world.

15:33.265 --> 15:36.534
Hmm. Do you think
you might get married?

15:36.536 --> 15:38.703
No.
Not yet. Maybe later.

15:39.505 --> 15:41.372
What about children?

15:42.708 --> 15:44.475
We never wanted kids.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.846
You say that
but if you were pregnant,

15:48.848 --> 15:50.415
you might feel different.

15:51.884 --> 15:53.384
It's not for us.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.324
We have got a child.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.326
Oh, that's lovely.
Is it your gran...

16:01.328 --> 16:04.295
Yes, it's my baby.
Our baby.

16:06.098 --> 16:08.132
I told you.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.268
It's rude to whisper
at the table.

16:11.003 --> 16:13.037
Henry and I couldn't
be happier.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.580
Do you have any
brothers or sisters?

16:22.582 --> 16:24.182
Do you have any family, Jill?

16:24.184 --> 16:27.418
I have a brother,
Jason. He is...
A dick.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.087
No. Mark.

16:29.922 --> 16:34.726
He is successful
and likes reminding me.

16:34.728 --> 16:40.198
Our parents died young
so he kind of became
my surrogate mum and dad.

16:41.433 --> 16:43.801
I guess I got sidelined
along the way.

16:43.803 --> 16:45.870
Mark is my family now.

16:45.872 --> 16:47.972
Family is very
important, dear.

16:47.974 --> 16:49.774
How about you two?

16:49.776 --> 16:52.010
Josephine's from
German heritage.

16:52.012 --> 16:54.345
I'm east London, army.

16:54.347 --> 16:59.951
Wow. That must have been,
uh, awkward.

16:59.953 --> 17:02.787
You know, two world wars
and one world cup. Huh?

17:03.389 --> 17:03.388
You know...

17:07.260 --> 17:11.162
1966, england versus Germany.

17:17.502 --> 17:21.305
Comedy, right?

17:21.307 --> 17:25.542
I'm sorry.
I get a bit nervous sometimes.

17:26.612 --> 17:28.212
I get it.

17:48.934 --> 17:50.968
Marcus: How the fuck
can they have a baby?

17:50.970 --> 17:52.503
I mean, how the hell
did that happen?

17:52.505 --> 17:55.606
Maybe they are not
as old as they look.
They just retired early.

17:55.608 --> 17:59.343
Hey, how do you think
it happened, huh?

17:59.345 --> 18:03.247
She laid back,
listening to Eva braun

18:03.249 --> 18:04.649
as he crept up behind her

18:04.651 --> 18:07.051
and gave a quick one-two
whilst reading the Bible.

18:08.488 --> 18:09.720
Don't ruin the mood.

18:26.472 --> 18:27.705
Ruined.

18:32.144 --> 18:34.112
Henry: I've seen bodies.

18:35.814 --> 18:37.348
Dead bodies.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.886
Bodies with no heads,

18:41.888 --> 18:46.691
no limbs, guts spewing out.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.696
And crows and eagles

18:53.298 --> 18:56.834
swooping down,
plucking out eyeballs...

18:58.904 --> 19:01.839
And tearing out
protruding tongues.

19:03.275 --> 19:06.911
Sometimes from living bodies.

19:12.185 --> 19:14.318
God.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.655
I miss those days.

19:21.593 --> 19:23.427
Excuse me.

19:28.100 --> 19:34.972
Decomposition begins
in the digestive system.

19:34.974 --> 19:39.877
And it feeds
on the internal organs.

19:41.146 --> 19:47.518
It causes bloating
and a marbling of the skin.

19:47.520 --> 19:51.355
And there is
a terrible swelling

19:51.357 --> 19:54.525
and protrusion of the tongue.

19:54.527 --> 20:01.332
And liquids and bloods flow
from every orifice.

20:04.603 --> 20:10.775
And there is a horrible smell
of rotting flesh.

20:13.845 --> 20:15.980
After that

20:15.982 --> 20:18.549
rigor mortis sets in.

20:19.885 --> 20:24.622
And it covers the whole body

20:25.123 --> 20:26.924
after about a day.

20:31.163 --> 20:33.397
It's really beautiful.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.374
Shit. I'm late.

20:44.276 --> 20:45.543
How do I look?

20:45.545 --> 20:48.879
Hmm, you look better with
your clothes off, baby.

20:52.017 --> 20:53.951
Oh, babe. Um...

20:56.121 --> 20:59.423
I'm going to need a bit
of money for food.

20:59.425 --> 21:00.691
Oh.

21:06.031 --> 21:09.100
Shit. I only have a twenty.

21:09.102 --> 21:10.935
Keep that
for two days.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.803
Don't spend it
on sweets or comics.

21:12.805 --> 21:14.472
Very funny.

21:14.474 --> 21:17.441
Perhaps I should do
the stand-up,
my material is funnier.

21:19.578 --> 21:22.280
What the fuck you know
about comedy?

22:13.066 --> 22:14.398
Henry: Marcus!

22:15.567 --> 22:16.834
Marcus!

22:17.235 --> 22:18.536
Marcus!

22:20.839 --> 22:21.939
Marcus!

22:25.577 --> 22:26.544
Yes, Henry?

22:26.546 --> 22:28.512
You come down here
at once!

22:31.483 --> 22:33.851
Um, you know
your baby is still...

22:36.588 --> 22:39.623
Don't leave your
dirty dishes in the sink.

22:39.625 --> 22:40.925
You clean them immediately!

22:40.927 --> 22:44.195
Yeah,
i was going to do it later.

22:44.197 --> 22:46.731
Not later. Now!

23:00.746 --> 23:03.481
Henry's voice: <i> Not later. Now!</i>

23:03.483 --> 23:06.784
<i> You clean them immediately!</i>

23:06.786 --> 23:11.722
You got a problem,
then you can clean it, Henry.

23:12.991 --> 23:15.459
Or what, old man?

23:52.664 --> 23:55.199
You dirty little bitch.

24:08.847 --> 24:13.083
Hey, Ben.
How you been, mate?

24:13.085 --> 24:17.822
Yeah, yeah. Yeah,
I'm trying some new
materials as we speak.

24:17.824 --> 24:21.058
Well, it might take
a bit of time, mate.
When would the next gig be?

24:21.960 --> 24:23.794
Next month?

24:23.796 --> 24:26.931
No, I need to be doing
more gigs, mate.

24:27.966 --> 24:30.901
Yeah. Yeah.

24:30.903 --> 24:33.170
Yeah, a bit busy, buddy.

24:34.272 --> 24:37.174
Yeah, you too. Bye.

24:42.914 --> 24:44.648
Henry:
I warned you!

24:46.952 --> 24:49.553
Don't phone again!

25:04.569 --> 25:07.538
Hey, babe.
Hey, honey.

25:07.540 --> 25:09.139
You get much writing done?

25:10.775 --> 25:10.774
A little.

25:10.776 --> 25:14.111
Since when did
you get so protective
of your material?

25:15.380 --> 25:17.081
Since you slagged it off.

25:18.116 --> 25:19.416
I'm starving.

25:19.418 --> 25:21.919
You want to order something?

25:38.169 --> 25:39.837
Oh, Jesus.

25:40.772 --> 25:43.707
Marcus, you can't
cook after 6:00.

25:45.243 --> 25:46.310
I'm sorry?

25:46.312 --> 25:48.612
You have to finish
cooking by 5:00.

25:48.914 --> 25:50.080
Why?

25:52.017 --> 25:53.751
I can't stand the smell.

26:04.763 --> 26:06.363
That old man
is a fucking asshole.

26:06.365 --> 26:08.799
Mark, keep it down.
What happened?

26:08.801 --> 26:10.167
First, we've got to
wash up before eating,

26:10.169 --> 26:12.303
and now, we're not allowed
to cook after 6:00.

26:12.305 --> 26:15.005
This is not our house.
We have to play
according to their rules.

26:15.007 --> 26:17.341
If they want to keep it clean
what's the harm in that?

26:17.343 --> 26:19.810
Hmm, why you are you
taking his side?

26:19.812 --> 26:22.947
I'm telling you.
He is going to be a problem.

26:22.949 --> 26:26.116
Mark. They are old.
They might have their reasons.

26:30.622 --> 26:32.590
When are we getting out
of this shithole?

26:32.592 --> 26:35.292
Hush. They might hear you.

26:35.294 --> 26:38.028
We won't find better
accommodation for this price.

26:38.030 --> 26:41.165
So bite your tongue,
smile and play nice.

26:53.511 --> 26:55.045
Mmm-mmm.

26:56.648 --> 26:59.049
You know why?

27:22.140 --> 27:24.308
Henry: Happy birthday.

28:03.948 --> 28:05.849
Henry.

28:05.851 --> 28:09.586
Look, I think we got off
to a bit of a bad start,

28:09.588 --> 28:11.388
and I'd like to start again.

28:13.058 --> 28:14.958
I want the bin bag.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.661
I want to put them
out all together in
the correct bins.

28:20.331 --> 28:22.332
Your baby is crying again.

28:23.635 --> 28:25.269
It will stop.

28:26.604 --> 28:28.105
Until you get a job,

28:28.107 --> 28:31.341
you'll need to do a few things
around the house.

28:31.343 --> 28:34.211
I have a job!

28:35.146 --> 28:38.148
Sarcasm is the lowest
form of wit.

28:40.285 --> 28:42.986
I wrote a joke once,

28:42.988 --> 28:47.758
about a wrinkly old man
who couldn't keep
his mouth shut.

28:47.760 --> 28:49.727
Do you want to hear it?

28:50.628 --> 28:53.497
If this place is "shithole",

28:54.365 --> 28:57.201
and I'm "asshole",

28:58.203 --> 28:59.870
why do you stay?

29:01.239 --> 29:02.940
Fucking wanker.

29:03.641 --> 29:05.542
What did you say, boy?

29:05.544 --> 29:07.778
Marcus: I didn't
fucking say anything.

29:07.780 --> 29:10.147
Mind your words, boy!

29:12.350 --> 29:14.351
You won't be here long.

29:16.688 --> 29:18.355
Fuck! Fuck!

29:19.824 --> 29:21.792
Fuck you, old man!

29:21.794 --> 29:24.561
Who's the fucking
bitch now, huh?

29:26.532 --> 29:27.698
You fucking old cunt!

29:28.934 --> 29:30.801
"Get a fucking real job."

29:32.504 --> 29:33.737
Cunt!

29:33.739 --> 29:35.873
I don't want to be here.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.908
I don't want to be here.

29:37.910 --> 29:40.844
Henry's voice: <i> Sarcasm is</i>
<i> the lowest form of wit.</i>

29:43.715 --> 29:45.949
<i> Mind your words, boy!</i>

29:54.692 --> 29:57.394
It's 2:00 A.M.,
for god's sake.

29:57.396 --> 30:01.732
It cries at the exact time
for the exact amount
of minutes each day.

30:01.734 --> 30:04.568
It's a baby.
That's what they do.

30:04.570 --> 30:07.738
Neither of us have ever
seen the baby.

30:07.740 --> 30:11.275
You really are
sounding paranoid now.

30:11.277 --> 30:15.813
If it's not the baby crying
then it's her playing
her weird-ass war music.

30:15.815 --> 30:19.149
Or him shouting randomly.

30:19.151 --> 30:22.519
Maybe you need to get
out of the house for
a while during the day.

30:22.521 --> 30:24.454
You are too isolated here.

30:24.456 --> 30:26.723
You're not here.

30:26.725 --> 30:30.227
That old man...
He's fucking crazy.

30:31.863 --> 30:34.331
Tried to scare him today,
and he just smiled.

30:34.333 --> 30:37.267
You what? You threatened him?
Are you insane?

30:37.269 --> 30:39.136
What did I say?
We need this place.

30:39.138 --> 30:41.038
He was demanding
i keep the room clean,

30:41.040 --> 30:44.007
that I hoover it,
and take the bins out.

30:44.009 --> 30:46.376
We don't live here for free.
We pay fucking rent!

30:46.378 --> 30:49.880
I've been asking you to do
that stuff for two weeks!

30:49.882 --> 30:52.182
And they've been listening
to our conversations.

30:52.184 --> 30:55.786
For fuck sake, Marcus.
Stop trying to find
reasons to move out.

30:55.788 --> 30:57.421
Grow up!

31:28.553 --> 31:30.621
Get out of my room!

31:30.623 --> 31:32.522
I want you
out of this house.

31:34.058 --> 31:36.660
It's just
research for an act.

31:36.662 --> 31:39.296
Vacate by tomorrow morning.

31:39.298 --> 31:41.798
We signed a contract.
We have rights.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.901
I will give you back
your money.

31:43.903 --> 31:46.303
Just be gone by tomorrow.

31:50.141 --> 31:52.042
What the fuck
is going on?

31:54.579 --> 31:56.246
Don't you worry,
we're leaving.

32:01.252 --> 32:02.519
I'm sorry.

32:03.554 --> 32:06.957
I'm not used to having
other people in the house.

32:06.959 --> 32:09.960
But he is going to make
a big effort from now on.

32:10.862 --> 32:13.096
It's too late.

32:13.098 --> 32:14.831
We don't
want you to leave.

32:14.833 --> 32:19.002
Jill has told us
this is the perfect
commute for her work.

32:19.004 --> 32:21.371
No more household chores.

32:21.373 --> 32:24.374
And you'll have your
own front-door key.

32:31.382 --> 32:32.649
For Jill.

32:48.733 --> 32:50.133
Where the fuck have you been?

32:50.135 --> 32:52.302
I had a few drinks after work.

32:52.737 --> 32:54.338
Ah.

32:55.473 --> 32:57.140
Well, while you've been
out getting wasted

32:57.142 --> 32:59.543
I've been attacked
by the evil fucker.

32:59.545 --> 33:03.146
Josephine explained it
all to me when I came in.
It's all sorted.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.182
He is fucking evil, Jill.

33:05.184 --> 33:06.883
Jill: That's a bit
extreme, isn't it?

33:06.885 --> 33:10.320
I'm not insane, Jill.

33:10.322 --> 33:12.823
Get a job so you're not
sitting at home all day,

33:12.825 --> 33:14.458
as you're obviously
not writing.

33:16.294 --> 33:18.028
I need peace
and quiet to write.

33:18.030 --> 33:19.730
Jill: Then what the hell
is the problem?

33:19.732 --> 33:21.765
I don't get any peace,
no space.

33:21.767 --> 33:24.735
This house...
That fucking old man is
making me fucking paranoid!

33:24.737 --> 33:27.404
Calm down, mark.
Calm down.

33:27.406 --> 33:30.707
We find somewhere
to live tomorrow...

33:30.709 --> 33:33.710
Or I swear to god
i... I'm going to
end up killing him.

33:33.712 --> 33:34.878
Don't be so stupid.

33:34.880 --> 33:37.047
I promise you, I'll kill him!

33:37.049 --> 33:39.182
And I will kill
that fucking baby, too!

33:39.184 --> 33:42.119
Stop it! You hear me?
You stop this now, mark.

33:42.121 --> 33:43.720
I don't like you like this.

33:43.722 --> 33:45.789
All this anger, it's no good.

33:45.791 --> 33:47.591
I won't live with you,
understand?

33:47.593 --> 33:50.794
I'm sorry. I'm really,
really sorry. It's just...

33:50.796 --> 33:51.995
I need more gigs.

33:51.997 --> 33:53.730
And I need to write.
I need to write.

34:14.351 --> 34:15.719
I forgive you.

34:17.088 --> 34:19.289
My brother is coming
for dinner.

34:19.857 --> 34:21.491
Marcus: Oh, fuck!

34:21.493 --> 34:25.829
The industry out there
is littered with a-listers
that need expertise.

34:25.831 --> 34:28.632
There's now talk of
a reality TV series
following my work.

34:28.634 --> 34:32.601
Latest client,
<i> embracing darkness</i>
author Matthew Cox.

34:33.771 --> 34:35.572
First novel went
stratospheric.

34:35.574 --> 34:39.208
Second novel sunk like
an unwanted Christmas puppy

34:39.210 --> 34:40.577
with a weight
around its neck.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.612
Third novel, he is bobbing
back up on the surface again.

34:43.614 --> 34:46.449
We are going
to repackage him,
reinvent him,

34:46.452 --> 34:50.487
send him out into the world
and make pots of money.

34:50.489 --> 34:53.523
So, sister dearest,
you have to share
this kitchen?

34:53.525 --> 34:55.625
The old couple kindly
let us use it.

34:55.627 --> 34:56.960
They're very welcoming.

34:56.962 --> 34:59.396
Yeah, very welcoming.

35:00.331 --> 35:02.933
You said something
about a job.

35:02.935 --> 35:06.002
Hmm. Life insurance.

35:06.004 --> 35:09.139
You work in a call center.

35:09.841 --> 35:12.008
It's just short-term.

35:12.010 --> 35:14.211
Jason: That's what I said
when I started.

35:14.213 --> 35:17.581
Now I work in
Berlin, Paris, New York.

35:19.584 --> 35:21.885
I even turned down
a six-figure sum
in Sydney this week.

35:21.887 --> 35:23.620
You know why?

35:23.622 --> 35:25.589
I don't like the weather.

35:32.530 --> 35:34.731
It's too fucking hot
down under.

35:34.733 --> 35:37.634
I like cold, gray weather.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.170
You know, Marcus,
New York is the place
for stand-ups.

35:40.172 --> 35:41.972
They're all there
plying their trade.

35:41.974 --> 35:46.643
You tickle the rib cage
of New York, you tickle
the rib cage of the world.

35:51.048 --> 35:53.150
Well, what are you
waiting for?

35:53.784 --> 35:55.719
Make me laugh.

35:55.721 --> 35:57.287
It doesn't work like that.

35:57.289 --> 35:58.588
If you can't improvise,

35:58.590 --> 36:01.958
you haven't got any chance
of success.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.326
Come on, mark,
you can do this.

36:03.328 --> 36:05.228
Prove brother dearest wrong.

36:08.933 --> 36:11.935
No, no, no.
Don't sit down.

36:11.937 --> 36:15.539
Stand up and do it.
You're a "stand-up",
aren't you?

36:15.873 --> 36:17.307
Right.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.479
"Danger wank."

36:23.648 --> 36:26.616
Danger wank.

36:26.618 --> 36:31.254
Imagine you're in your room,
having a wank

36:31.256 --> 36:33.790
and your mum has just
called you for dinner

36:33.792 --> 36:35.992
but you're right in
the middle of the act.

36:35.994 --> 36:40.030
So you just carry on.

36:40.032 --> 36:42.832
From that moment on
you've got less than
one minute,

36:42.834 --> 36:47.337
before your mother
comes upstairs,
to finish wanking.

36:47.339 --> 36:50.874
Now that, my friend,
is some serious

36:50.876 --> 36:54.644
danger fucking wanking.

37:08.659 --> 37:13.697
If it's money you need,
i could find you a job
in my company.

37:13.699 --> 37:17.667
You'd have to start
at the bottom,
but it is something. Hm?

37:38.022 --> 37:39.489
Jill: I kicked Jason out.

37:41.325 --> 37:42.826
"Danger wank."

37:44.095 --> 37:45.662
I found it funny.

37:48.900 --> 37:49.966
What the fuck do you know?

37:49.968 --> 37:51.868
You don't even
like my material.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.638
What is wrong with you?

37:54.640 --> 37:57.774
I had that chance
to make it, didn't I?

37:57.776 --> 38:00.443
And I blew it,
and we both know why.

38:01.946 --> 38:04.881
What? It's my fault?

38:07.018 --> 38:09.252
And you...

38:09.254 --> 38:10.987
You wear the trousers
in this relationship

38:10.989 --> 38:12.289
and I'm meant to be
the fucking man.

38:12.291 --> 38:14.057
Then act like one.

38:14.059 --> 38:15.859
You give me pocket money

38:15.861 --> 38:18.561
to buy things, you tell me
what I can and cannot do.

38:18.563 --> 38:21.197
I tell you what,
tell you what,
tell you what...

38:21.199 --> 38:22.699
You're no different
from that nutty, old man.

38:22.701 --> 38:24.100
No wonder I wanna
fucking kill him.

38:24.102 --> 38:27.237
Fine. Then add me
to this kill list
you're planning.

38:27.239 --> 38:29.406
You side with him

38:29.408 --> 38:32.008
and that old bitch
when you know

38:32.010 --> 38:34.511
they're trying
to drive me mad.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.747
And you are in with them.

38:38.649 --> 38:41.051
Will you
listen to yourself?

38:41.053 --> 38:43.253
You're a paranoid mess,
Marcus.

38:43.255 --> 38:45.355
Don't talk about them
this way.

38:45.357 --> 38:47.357
You only date me
to piss your brother off,

38:47.359 --> 38:49.459
when you treat me like
I'm your fucking bitch!

38:50.328 --> 38:52.495
You are my fucking bitch.

38:54.832 --> 38:58.101
You haven't got the balls.
You're a coward.

39:05.710 --> 39:11.514
Why don't you just go
and fucking marry
that old man,

39:11.516 --> 39:14.651
so the three of you can
live happily ever after.

39:17.855 --> 39:21.791
Let's see how you manage
on your own, bitch,
without my handouts.

40:01.832 --> 40:05.068
Oh, hello, I'd like
to have some roses
delivered, please.

40:18.048 --> 40:19.482
Twenty.

40:22.586 --> 40:24.988
It always stops
crying on 20.

42:15.299 --> 42:16.566
You came back...

42:17.468 --> 42:19.569
Sorry, I thought
you were mark.

42:22.239 --> 42:24.407
Did you see him
at all today?

42:24.409 --> 42:26.609
Well, we heard
a lot of banging.

42:26.611 --> 42:28.678
Sounded like he was
packing things.

42:28.680 --> 42:30.847
Then the front door slammed.

42:32.216 --> 42:34.784
Did he say anything
at all to you?

42:34.786 --> 42:36.319
No, dear.

42:36.321 --> 42:38.454
If he's angry,
he'll come back.

42:38.456 --> 42:39.989
Just give him time.

42:40.958 --> 42:42.458
You look exhausted.

42:42.460 --> 42:44.727
You need something to eat.

42:44.729 --> 42:47.797
Come on,
let us look after you.
No, I'm fine.

42:47.799 --> 42:49.666
Oh, come on, dear.
Eat something.

42:49.668 --> 42:52.168
Just leave me alone,
for fuck's sake.

43:26.370 --> 43:28.972
Jill: <i> Hello,</i>
<i> I'm sorry, okay.</i>

43:28.974 --> 43:31.307
<i> You haven't</i>
<i> killed them,</i>
<i> have you?</i>

43:31.309 --> 43:33.209
<i> I'm a little drunk.</i>

43:33.211 --> 43:35.411
<i> Still angry-drunk but...</i>

43:35.413 --> 43:38.915
<i> I forgive you, um,</i>
<i> and I love you.</i>

43:56.667 --> 44:00.637
"Gone to
a friend's home,

44:00.639 --> 44:03.773
"for a few days.

44:04.375 --> 44:07.276
"I need to concentrate

44:07.278 --> 44:09.045
"and write material.

44:09.813 --> 44:10.880
"X."

44:14.284 --> 44:15.351
Busy.

44:16.587 --> 44:20.189
Busy. Busy.
Busy. Busy.

44:23.460 --> 44:24.894
Jason: It's never too early.
Henry: No.

44:24.896 --> 44:27.296
Man after
my own heart.

44:30.734 --> 44:31.868
For your baby.

44:31.870 --> 44:34.370
Yes.
Winter's coming.

44:37.175 --> 44:37.173
I have to admit that

44:37.175 --> 44:41.978
I thought Jill was lying
at first when she told me
you had a newborn baby

44:41.980 --> 44:44.981
but that's the miracles
of modern science.

44:47.117 --> 44:49.185
You know, I work with
a lot of famous doctors.

44:49.787 --> 44:52.455
What do you
do for work?

44:52.457 --> 44:54.490
I take famous people
and their money

44:54.492 --> 44:58.161
and I make them
even more famous
and even more money.

45:09.106 --> 45:11.741
My sister is bit of
a wreck at the moment.
Jason.

45:11.743 --> 45:14.010
Well, it's true,
isn't it?

45:15.179 --> 45:18.247
We're trying to find out
where Marcus may have gone,

45:18.249 --> 45:19.782
talking to everyone.

45:19.784 --> 45:22.485
I'm guessing you were
the last people to see him?

45:22.487 --> 45:25.288
Well, saw him through
the window here

45:25.290 --> 45:26.456
with a suitcase.

45:26.458 --> 45:27.657
Never looked back.

45:27.659 --> 45:29.325
You told me you
hadn't seen him.

45:30.094 --> 45:32.161
Not face-to-face.

45:32.163 --> 45:34.530
I didn't like
speaking with him.

45:34.532 --> 45:36.132
I can understand that.

45:38.168 --> 45:39.902
I've always had to
look after her.

45:41.805 --> 45:43.906
Ever since our
parents died,

45:43.908 --> 45:45.708
I more or less
brought her up.

45:46.778 --> 45:48.945
That is from
the boer war!

45:50.714 --> 45:51.848
Uh... may I?

45:51.850 --> 45:53.783
Yes. Pick it up.

45:53.785 --> 45:55.384
Give it a swing.

45:58.522 --> 46:00.223
Goodness gracious.

46:08.565 --> 46:09.832
Wow.

46:47.070 --> 46:50.039
So you think
you're funny, boy.

47:09.693 --> 47:10.960
Help!

47:11.428 --> 47:12.995
Help!

47:58.275 --> 48:01.711
If I don't hear
from mark by tonight
I'm calling the police.

48:01.713 --> 48:03.679
Don't be so
dramatic, Jill.

48:03.681 --> 48:05.348
It's good he's gone.

48:05.350 --> 48:06.616
He was a loser.

48:06.618 --> 48:08.551
You don't know him
like I do.

48:08.553 --> 48:10.152
He dragged you down.

48:11.188 --> 48:14.056
You and the old man
taking the piss out of mark.

48:14.058 --> 48:16.959
Ganging up on him
when he's not even here
to defend himself.

48:16.961 --> 48:19.729
Don't be so
deluded, Jill.

48:19.731 --> 48:22.965
He's left you.
Face facts.

48:27.271 --> 48:28.704
Mark was right,

48:28.706 --> 48:31.207
the old couple
are acting strange.

48:31.209 --> 48:33.943
Neither of us have
ever seen the baby.

48:33.945 --> 48:36.312
I haven't heard it cry
since mark disappeared.

48:37.180 --> 48:39.148
Will you listen
to yourself, Jill?

48:39.150 --> 48:42.385
Marcus has turned you
into the same
paranoid mess he was.

48:42.986 --> 48:44.553
Now, I have to be honest,

48:44.555 --> 48:45.888
I think they're great.

48:45.890 --> 48:48.257
I want them
to adopt me.

48:48.259 --> 48:49.625
And they love you.

48:49.627 --> 48:51.827
No, something is not right.

48:57.668 --> 48:59.936
"Sorry I haven't
been in contact.

48:59.938 --> 49:01.704
"Writing going great.

49:01.706 --> 49:03.873
"Be back once finished.
See you then."

49:03.875 --> 49:05.441
Smiley face and...

49:07.611 --> 49:11.414
Who the fuck puts
smiley faces on the end of
text messages at his age?

49:11.915 --> 49:13.649
Like I said, Jill,

49:13.651 --> 49:15.384
he's a fucking child.

49:19.856 --> 49:21.424
There's the baby.

49:22.726 --> 49:24.260
Happy now?

49:28.231 --> 49:30.533
I still think
you should leave him.

49:31.768 --> 49:33.602
I'll check in on you
later in the week,

49:33.604 --> 49:35.972
see how you're getting on.

49:38.275 --> 49:40.409
It's time to move on,
baby sister.

49:49.386 --> 49:50.453
Help me.

49:51.088 --> 49:54.457
Listen to me, listen...

49:54.459 --> 49:55.524
They didn't tie you up.

49:56.927 --> 49:58.194
Help me.

49:59.429 --> 50:00.696
Detective McQueen:
Don't worry, love.

50:02.766 --> 50:05.134
We've known about
these people for years.

50:05.502 --> 50:06.569
Untie me.

50:06.571 --> 50:07.870
I'll get us both out.

50:07.872 --> 50:10.706
No. Can't.

50:10.708 --> 50:12.575
Help us.

50:12.577 --> 50:15.945
They killed my brother
and my boyfriend!

50:15.947 --> 50:17.213
Not just him.

50:18.482 --> 50:19.582
There has been others.

50:20.417 --> 50:22.018
What do you mean,
"it's too late"?

50:22.020 --> 50:24.653
We have known about
these people for years.

50:28.225 --> 50:30.226
For god's sake,
come on.

50:31.828 --> 50:34.063
Don't worry about it, love.

50:34.065 --> 50:36.999
We have known these
people for years.

50:37.001 --> 50:38.934
Jill: Listen to me. Listen.

50:38.936 --> 50:41.470
We have never found
anyone alive before.

50:42.539 --> 50:43.806
What about her?

50:47.878 --> 50:50.646
What are you
waiting for?
Help us!

50:50.648 --> 50:52.548
You are meant to help!

50:52.550 --> 50:56.685
This is what happened to
the last woman we helped.

50:56.687 --> 50:57.753
She's dead...

50:59.623 --> 51:00.890
And so are you.

51:32.556 --> 51:35.825
Josephine: He must
have damaged him
when he touched him.

51:38.728 --> 51:42.731
How dare you touch
my baby boy.

52:10.293 --> 52:11.360
Oh...

52:31.348 --> 52:31.347
Mark!

52:31.349 --> 52:34.083
Mark! Mark! Mark!
Mark! Mark! Mark!

52:40.390 --> 52:42.858
Henry: I want to
hear the match.

52:49.366 --> 52:50.666
Marcus!

53:00.076 --> 53:01.477
Jill: Mark!

54:47.117 --> 54:49.285
I keep worrying, Henry.

54:49.287 --> 54:51.887
What if it doesn't
happen in time?

54:53.356 --> 54:55.691
What if one of us
doesn't make it?

54:57.093 --> 54:59.461
Couldn't bear to
live without you, dear.

55:00.797 --> 55:02.965
Life is so short.

55:03.933 --> 55:06.001
If it ever came to that,

55:06.003 --> 55:07.903
I'd make sure
we go together.

55:42.972 --> 55:45.240
"I often go to listen,

55:45.242 --> 55:47.743
"when all is silent."

56:19.743 --> 56:22.411
It's just a tranq...

56:51.207 --> 56:52.841
He came back and then they

56:52.843 --> 56:55.043
took all their
belongings and left.

56:55.045 --> 56:56.378
When?

56:56.380 --> 56:58.046
The day after you came.

56:58.048 --> 56:59.314
It's a shame,

56:59.316 --> 57:01.784
my wife and i
really liked your sister.

57:01.786 --> 57:04.720
We asked her to
stay but she left.

57:04.722 --> 57:07.923
She usually doesn't do
anything without
checking with me first.

57:07.925 --> 57:12.327
Well, we think he gave her
some kind of ultimatum.

57:12.329 --> 57:14.797
I really don't understand
what she saw in him.

57:16.533 --> 57:19.802
Can you give me moment?
I need to make a call.

57:36.786 --> 57:40.088
Operator: <i> This person's</i>
<i> phone is switched off.</i>

57:46.429 --> 57:47.696
Well, thank you.

57:48.198 --> 57:49.465
Goodbye.

57:57.207 --> 58:00.042
Will he be a problem?

58:00.044 --> 58:04.012
I think we might need to get
some more plastic sheeting.

59:10.179 --> 59:11.980
Somebody help me!

59:16.252 --> 59:17.819
No one can hear you.

59:19.222 --> 59:22.190
Why are you doing this to me?

59:24.527 --> 59:26.261
We had a child.

59:27.130 --> 59:29.798
But he died, because of me.

59:31.968 --> 59:35.003
She will never forgive
unless I make up.

59:36.406 --> 59:38.907
I failed
Josephine once.

59:40.577 --> 59:42.277
I won't this time.

59:45.782 --> 59:49.751
Josephine won't bury him
until she has a new baby.

59:55.858 --> 59:58.927
Please, somebody help me.

59:58.929 --> 01:00:00.996
Don't think you're so special.

01:00:00.998 --> 01:00:03.632
Don't you know
how many people
have been sacrificed,

01:00:03.634 --> 01:00:05.200
giving us back our baby?

01:00:06.369 --> 01:00:08.337
Oh, we don't keep them here.

01:00:08.339 --> 01:00:10.772
They are spread across London.

01:00:15.511 --> 01:00:17.946
Same as I will
do for Marcus.

01:00:18.748 --> 01:00:21.283
But I kept him as a memento,

01:00:21.285 --> 01:00:25.320
seeing he likes
joking so much.

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:49.511
Thought he could
keep you company,

01:00:49.513 --> 01:00:51.279
try and make you laugh.

01:01:25.948 --> 01:01:28.116
We prayed every night...

01:01:29.385 --> 01:01:32.120
...and god
gave us you.

01:02:00.883 --> 01:02:02.818
I know who you are!

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.722
You don't own me!

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:10.058
Nobody owns me!

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.995
The queen doesn't own me!

01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:18.400
I will shit on your face!

01:02:23.039 --> 01:02:26.174
Come out, I know
who you both are!

01:02:27.343 --> 01:02:29.845
I know who you both are!

01:02:32.648 --> 01:02:36.218
Get off my property.

01:02:39.455 --> 01:02:42.758
Get off my property.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:46.428
I'm sorry, sir.

01:03:08.518 --> 01:03:10.018
Oh...

01:03:14.423 --> 01:03:18.426
It's your menstrual cycle.

01:03:21.497 --> 01:03:23.598
Dated,

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:29.337
for when you're
ripe for seed.

01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:39.748
Josephine assures me

01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:42.851
that her shade
matches your skin tone.

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:21.456
You don't know what pain is.

01:06:41.898 --> 01:06:43.231
Shh.

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:45.166
Oh, no.

01:08:43.419 --> 01:08:44.953
Mark,

01:08:44.955 --> 01:08:47.255
I'm sorry for what I said.

01:08:53.028 --> 01:08:54.662
It's "Henry".

01:08:56.732 --> 01:08:58.332
It's Henry.

01:08:59.068 --> 01:09:01.870
Say "Henry," sweetheart.

01:09:06.008 --> 01:09:07.709
Say it for me.

01:09:07.711 --> 01:09:09.109
Say my name.

01:09:09.112 --> 01:09:10.578
It's Henry.

01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:13.281
Say "Henry," please.

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:21.723
Say it, say it, say it.

01:09:22.925 --> 01:09:24.492
Say "Henry."

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:44.679
Once the baby is born,

01:09:45.281 --> 01:09:46.915
what do we
do with her?

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:49.783
Can we keep her?

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:54.923
I know what you
have in mind, mister.

01:09:56.292 --> 01:09:59.561
No, we can't keep her.

01:09:59.563 --> 01:10:03.498
We have to get rid
of her, just like we
got rid of the others.

01:10:05.768 --> 01:10:07.502
Oh, that's sad.

01:10:08.837 --> 01:10:11.239
I thought we
could keep her.

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.895
Two more months to go.

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:18.666
I will start on
the baby's room.

01:12:39.888 --> 01:12:41.122
Henry.

01:12:42.124 --> 01:12:43.524
Henry!

01:12:44.993 --> 01:12:46.527
Henry, its time.

01:13:05.748 --> 01:13:07.415
We'll have to cut
the baby out.

01:13:07.417 --> 01:13:09.083
No. No. No!

01:13:09.085 --> 01:13:10.618
No! No!

01:13:16.191 --> 01:13:17.959
You'll kill the baby.

01:13:20.329 --> 01:13:21.629
She will run.

01:13:21.631 --> 01:13:22.463
Where to?

01:13:22.465 --> 01:13:24.198
She can't get
past us both.

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:25.266
Do it, Henry.

01:13:25.268 --> 01:13:26.734
Okay.

01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:34.942
Josephine: Lay her
flat on the floor.

01:13:45.587 --> 01:13:47.455
Hold her down.

01:13:49.391 --> 01:13:51.993
Push my baby out!

01:13:51.995 --> 01:13:55.163
Or I will cut it out
and leave you to bleed!

01:13:56.131 --> 01:13:58.132
Push my baby out!

01:14:03.205 --> 01:14:04.572
Push!

01:14:19.721 --> 01:14:20.788
Yes.

01:14:38.207 --> 01:14:40.007
Massage its chest!

01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:48.149
We got our
baby boy back, Henry.

01:14:56.391 --> 01:14:58.526
Our baby boy, Henry!

01:15:00.729 --> 01:15:03.331
We got our baby
boy back, Henry.

01:15:03.333 --> 01:15:05.066
It's our baby boy.

01:15:11.273 --> 01:15:12.573
Come at me and
i will kill it!

01:15:12.575 --> 01:15:15.676
Get our baby, Henry!

01:15:17.813 --> 01:15:20.648
We can't lose
our baby again.

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:39.767
I'm so...

01:15:41.436 --> 01:15:43.070
No!

01:15:43.072 --> 01:15:44.772
We had a child,

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:46.941
but he died.

01:16:47.636 --> 01:16:49.203
What if one of us
doesn't make it?

01:16:49.205 --> 01:16:51.906
I couldn't bear to
live without you, dear.

01:17:13.495 --> 01:17:14.829
Shh.
