00:01.084 --> 00:02.477
Previously on Chesapeake Shores...

00:02.502 --> 00:05.964
Please tell Bree I'm here to
return this. She left it unguarded.

00:06.131 --> 00:08.758
And tell her that she had
no right to write about me.

00:08.925 --> 00:11.712
Abby, when I left, it was hard.

00:11.713 --> 00:13.513
But I'm back now and nothing's changed.

00:13.930 --> 00:16.433
I'm worried I'm making that
mistake too with Danielle.

00:16.599 --> 00:19.269
- I thought you guys were good.
- Sometimes, not so sure.

00:19.336 --> 00:22.021
Give me one more chance, I
will never hurt you again.

00:22.188 --> 00:23.815
I'm sorry.

00:25.400 --> 00:28.820
I have something for you. From
the estate of James Nelson.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

00:55.513 --> 00:56.556
Excuse me.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.142
Is this, uh, slip 32?

00:59.642 --> 01:01.269
Yeah.

01:02.103 --> 01:05.355
Uh, I think there's
supposed to be a boat here.

01:05.522 --> 01:10.028
Let's see where you... No,
you want D-32. D is for "dry."

01:11.321 --> 01:13.350
I'm shocked someone's coming by for her.

01:13.351 --> 01:15.366
She's been sitting for 30 years.

01:15.533 --> 01:16.951
- Thirty years?
- Yeah.

01:32.801 --> 01:37.639
So that must make you
Mick O'Brien, new owner.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.850
Yeah, I guess it does.

01:42.727 --> 01:48.274
Guessing you probably wanna
haul her, strip her for parts.

01:59.619 --> 02:02.163
So, what do you wanna do?

02:10.003 --> 02:13.967
Hey, so, um, Donovan Wylie's still here.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.625
Considering his traveling,

02:15.626 --> 02:17.846
this might be the longest he's stayed anywhere.

02:18.012 --> 02:19.430
Hm.

02:21.891 --> 02:24.269
Oh, my goodness. Ha-ha.

02:24.435 --> 02:26.062
Your Little League trophies.

02:26.229 --> 02:29.732
- My parents kept everything.
- No wonder they wanted to clean the attic.

02:29.899 --> 02:31.734
Now they're filling up mine.

02:32.527 --> 02:37.282
You know, I'm just wondering,
uh, why he's here at all.

02:37.448 --> 02:39.200
What do you mean?

02:39.367 --> 02:43.413
I mean, doesn't he have
someplace else to go or a family?

02:43.580 --> 02:46.166
Donovan? I guess he did.

02:46.332 --> 02:49.419
From what he said, it sounds
like he doesn't see them much.

02:50.378 --> 02:52.046
Mm.

02:52.213 --> 02:53.798
That's lonely.

02:53.965 --> 02:56.551
When you tour this long,
you don't know anything else.

02:56.968 --> 02:59.178
You just get used to it. Keep moving.

03:00.430 --> 03:04.100
When the tour comes through
Baltimore, you gotta see Donovan.

03:04.267 --> 03:08.104
He is an amazing storyteller, and
the audience is singing every word.

03:09.564 --> 03:11.800
When the tour comes through Baltimore,

03:11.801 --> 03:13.443
I'm only interested in the opening act.

03:13.610 --> 03:16.404
Play your cards right, I might
be able to get you backstage.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.281
- Mmm.
- What'd you find?

03:19.282 --> 03:21.451
Oh. Just your letterman jacket.

03:21.618 --> 03:25.038
Ooh! You didn't take this
thing off in high school.

03:25.204 --> 03:27.457
Come on.

03:30.001 --> 03:32.962
- Okay, I feel ridiculous.
- I think it still looks great on you.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.843
Abby, is everything okay?

03:40.386 --> 03:43.681
Yeah. I just remembered that
I have a lot of work to do...

03:43.848 --> 03:46.184
so I should probably
get going. Give me some.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.311
- Okay. Heh.
- I will see you later.

03:50.813 --> 03:52.315
Bye.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.747
- Synced and corrected by <font color="#009BCB">chamallow</font> -
- www.addic7ed.com -

05:05.263 --> 05:07.181
- Is this a bad time?
- No.

05:07.348 --> 05:09.267
I love being interrupted while working.

05:09.434 --> 05:13.813
Good. I mean, I understand. Um,
which... when you're done working...

05:13.980 --> 05:16.149
would you mind
reading my manuscript?

05:16.316 --> 05:20.111
Heh. Why would I want to do
that? Jess read a part of it...

05:20.278 --> 05:23.448
- and you two are still not speaking.
- Oh, no. We're speaking.

05:23.614 --> 05:27.035
Yeah, it's just that the
sentences are shorter.

05:27.201 --> 05:30.997
Fine, she read it. She thinks it's
about the family. It's not, okay?

05:31.164 --> 05:34.125
She read a small part, about a
little girl who waits outside...

05:34.292 --> 05:36.169
for her mom to come home every night.

05:36.335 --> 05:38.546
Bree, that sounds exactly like Jess.

05:38.713 --> 05:41.007
No, it's exactly like...

05:41.174 --> 05:44.594
all of us, which means it's
not about her, it's about loss.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.350
Hey, Abs, Jess needs your camera, please.

05:48.351 --> 05:49.682
Mine's still getting repaired.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.851
I'm taking pictures of the B and B.

05:52.018 --> 05:54.228
It's in my closet, top
shelf, on the right.

05:54.395 --> 05:57.273
- I already looked there.
- No, it's in my closet.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.026
- Heh-heh-heh.
- Gran, you borrowed my camera?

06:00.193 --> 06:02.612
I had some important
business at city hall...

06:02.779 --> 06:05.323
and I needed one with
more of those megapixels.

06:06.491 --> 06:07.825
Uh, should I even ask?

06:08.242 --> 06:10.328
No. Not unless you
wanna be an accomplice.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.371
Come on, I'll show her where it is.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.625
Bree.

06:18.586 --> 06:20.505
Honey, I don't think it's all you.

06:20.671 --> 06:23.091
It's David too. He hasn't
called her in two days.

06:23.257 --> 06:25.134
And Jess is starting to lose it.

06:25.301 --> 06:28.471
- Two days? They talk every two minutes.
- Do you not have a home?

06:28.638 --> 06:31.265
After a week of night shifts,
my refrigerator's empty.

06:31.432 --> 06:34.519
By the way, who made
this? Because it's amazing.

06:34.685 --> 06:36.646
- I did. I'm glad you like it.
- Mm.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.940
And that is my lunch.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.399
You want it back?

06:40.566 --> 06:42.276
- Is there more of that?
- Yes.

06:42.443 --> 06:43.486
Huh.

06:43.653 --> 06:45.905
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Don't work too hard, okay?

06:46.072 --> 06:48.199
- Oh, somebody went flying.
- Had to.

06:48.366 --> 06:50.827
- Beautiful day, tailwind home.
- And a happy man.

06:50.993 --> 06:52.328
Heh.

06:52.954 --> 06:56.457
- Hey, getting some work done?
- Not as much as I would like.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.336
So, um...

07:00.503 --> 07:02.713
Connor's staying with Jess, huh?

07:04.340 --> 07:07.218
Uh, yeah. Until he finds a place.

07:07.385 --> 07:10.304
- Well, good for him.
- Dad.

07:10.930 --> 07:14.058
No, no. It... It was time.

07:16.352 --> 07:17.979
You look like you've seen a ghost.

07:19.355 --> 07:21.816
I just feel like I can't
get away from the past.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.151
Oh.

07:23.317 --> 07:26.612
Well, considering where we live,
that's pretty hard to avoid.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.207
What's that?

07:38.374 --> 07:40.251
- A letter.
- To Trace.

07:41.377 --> 07:45.465
Uh, yeah, that I wrote...

07:47.675 --> 07:50.344
- a week before Wes proposed.
- Why?

07:50.511 --> 07:54.724
- Uh, that's just it, I don't... I don't know.
- He never opened it?

07:54.891 --> 07:56.976
Hm. No.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.604
No, and I don't remember what I said.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.397
I just remember...

08:01.564 --> 08:05.234
one night I woke up, and I started
writing and writing and writing...

08:06.861 --> 08:09.405
So, uh, why do you have it?

08:10.615 --> 08:12.366
Move your feet.

08:21.167 --> 08:24.003
You are a horrible guest.

08:24.754 --> 08:25.796
What?

08:25.963 --> 08:29.342
Why? I'm just going over an amendment
to the Endangered Species Act.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.845
Okay, fine, but you're
a horrible brother.

08:33.011 --> 08:35.347
Uh, still not following.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.142
When I poured your
coffee, I was sniffling.

08:38.308 --> 08:41.437
When I dropped off your
quiche, I was holding in sobs.

08:41.604 --> 08:44.607
- I'm trying to be strong.
- I thought you had allergies...

08:44.774 --> 08:47.511
or hiccups or trying to be strong.

08:47.512 --> 08:49.654
Okay, I guess I am a horrible brother.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.782
It's David.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.910
Or more precisely, the lack of David.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.245
Jess, I'm sorry.

08:57.745 --> 09:01.332
I know everyone thinks that
I'm strong and put together...

09:01.499 --> 09:03.668
and driven and responsible...

09:03.834 --> 09:06.671
Whoa, whoa. That's... that's Abby.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.965
I'm trying to be more
like her when I'm upset.

09:09.131 --> 09:11.050
- Jess?
- Yes?

09:11.217 --> 09:13.678
What happened between you and Bree?

09:14.470 --> 09:16.597
What do you mean? Heh.

09:16.764 --> 09:20.101
Well, not that I mind,
in fact, I like this...

09:20.268 --> 09:22.770
but you never ask my advice, ever.

09:23.354 --> 09:27.650
I mean, you did when it was
only us in the house, but...

09:30.319 --> 09:31.529
Wait, are... ?

09:31.696 --> 09:34.365
- Are you channeling Abby?
- Trying.

09:37.994 --> 09:41.497
Bree isn't very good at keeping secrets.

09:43.374 --> 09:46.127
- That was actually pretty good.
- Thanks.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.130
Listen, Jess...

09:50.089 --> 09:52.258
everything's gonna be all right.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.802
I promise, okay?

09:54.969 --> 09:58.639
And if you let me go get you
some coffee, we can talk about...

09:59.140 --> 10:01.517
David, I just want to talk about David.

10:08.232 --> 10:10.484
- Connor.
- Yeah?

10:11.485 --> 10:13.863
You actually are a really good brother.

10:25.791 --> 10:28.628
I like them changes. That something new?

10:29.170 --> 10:31.881
Maybe. You know, I don't know yet.

10:32.048 --> 10:34.216
Mark's been pushing me
for new material, so...

10:34.383 --> 10:38.554
Mm. Most of the time, people
wanna hear me play my hits.

10:38.971 --> 10:41.432
I start out something new...

10:41.599 --> 10:44.477
everybody starts to wonder
why they came to see me. Heh.

10:44.644 --> 10:45.895
How do you handle that?

10:46.062 --> 10:48.522
You hear 30,000 people
yelling your name...

10:48.689 --> 10:51.067
you just give them what they want.

10:51.734 --> 10:56.030
Finally, I get to hear the "poor
Donovan Wylie" routine. Heh.

10:56.197 --> 10:58.324
What's next? No champagne
on your private jet?

11:00.743 --> 11:04.455
- You interested in finding out?
- What are you talking about?

11:05.456 --> 11:08.542
I just got a spot at Stagecoach.
You could join me on my set.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.294
Stagecoach?

11:10.461 --> 11:13.005
That's in like two days.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.966
- What? Just pick up and go?
- You don't wanna miss this.

11:16.133 --> 11:18.803
Forty-eight hours, there and back.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.724
- I'll think about it.
- Yeah, you will.

11:33.567 --> 11:34.735
You seem worried.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.738
Yeah, it's what I wrote.

11:38.072 --> 11:41.117
I know. End of your play
doesn't make any sense.

11:41.283 --> 11:44.412
When the woman crushes
the rose thing at the end?

11:44.578 --> 11:47.206
- I don't think anybody understands it.
- It's symbolic...

11:47.373 --> 11:49.542
of how our past memories
become part of...

11:49.708 --> 11:51.794
You know what? It's not important.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.547
- It's about my book.
- Oh. Oh.

11:54.713 --> 11:58.259
- Oh, the book about our family.
- Okay, it's not about our...

11:58.426 --> 12:00.010
Never mind. Never mind!

12:05.349 --> 12:08.352
I was always taught that
you write what you know.

12:08.519 --> 12:11.939
- How do you know where to draw the line?
- You don't. At least not always.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.525
Oh, that's a horrible answer.

12:14.692 --> 12:17.027
No, it's an answer you
don't wanna hear right now.

12:17.194 --> 12:20.156
Before every mission, we were
given rules of engagement.

12:20.322 --> 12:22.366
Okay? A line in the sand.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.578
But that's just not
how life works always.

12:25.744 --> 12:27.621
You need to make it up as you go.

12:28.497 --> 12:32.334
Okay, what if you think you
might have crossed the line?

12:32.793 --> 12:34.336
Ah.

12:34.503 --> 12:37.423
Try not to make the same mistake twice.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.176
Right.

12:56.984 --> 13:00.154
- Ms. O'Brien?
- Yup? Oh, Bree, please.

13:00.321 --> 13:03.741
Sierra Van Gheem. I can't tell you
how excited we are to have you here.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.910
We all thought you
were living in Chicago.

13:06.076 --> 13:10.331
Yes, yes. I thought I was gonna
be living in Chicago by now too.

13:10.498 --> 13:13.584
So the cast can't wait to meet
you, and I have to ask you...

13:13.751 --> 13:16.587
a couple questions about that ending.

13:17.463 --> 13:18.714
Simon?

13:20.883 --> 13:23.761
Uh, um, what are you doing here?

13:23.928 --> 13:27.973
Bree. I'm on a publicity
tour for Forever Caroline.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.558
Oh, the, um...

13:29.725 --> 13:33.062
I carry it in my store. It's
another bestseller. Congratulations.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.730
You hated it, didn't you?

13:34.897 --> 13:36.857
No more than I hated
It's Always Caroline.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.443
- I expected as much. Good for you.
- Mm.

13:39.610 --> 13:45.199
Um, so my question still
lingers: what are you doing here?

13:45.366 --> 13:48.202
I saw that they were doing
your play in Baltimore...

13:48.369 --> 13:51.997
and I thought it'd be fun
to see some local theater...

13:52.164 --> 13:53.874
so here I am.

13:57.753 --> 14:01.632
"... would be preferable to
the devastation in her wake."

14:02.258 --> 14:05.010
Oh. So...

14:05.177 --> 14:06.804
you're mad at Bree too?

14:08.556 --> 14:10.516
Honestly, uh...

14:10.683 --> 14:13.519
Bree's manuscript is not
the first thing on my mind.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.647
Did you know Connor is
a really good listener?

14:16.814 --> 14:19.494
Oh, you're talking to Connor now.
I mean, his advice is horrible...

14:21.485 --> 14:23.946
and he has lots of it, but...

14:24.113 --> 14:25.540
he really knows how to stay quiet.

14:25.541 --> 14:28.242
So I take it you're
thinking about David.

14:28.742 --> 14:30.536
And Bree.

14:30.703 --> 14:33.289
Bree's manuscript is
number two for me also.

14:34.373 --> 14:38.043
You know, maybe Bree is right about me.

14:38.210 --> 14:41.213
Maybe I ran away. Maybe...

14:41.755 --> 14:43.090
that's what I do.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.551
You are Fiona. It makes sense.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.344
No, I am not Fiona.

14:47.511 --> 14:50.231
- Everyone thinks that I'm so...
- Strong, driven...

14:52.933 --> 14:55.060
put together, responsible?

14:56.645 --> 15:00.149
When I am pretending to be
you, that's what I think of.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.401
Maybe I'm none of those things. Maybe...

15:04.361 --> 15:07.907
being strong is not who I actually am.

15:24.673 --> 15:27.009
That is exactly what I would have done.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.511
I know, right?

16:12.221 --> 16:13.639
Wow.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.266
- Thank you so much, Bree.
- Oh, no, thank you.

16:16.433 --> 16:19.144
- Thank you so much for inviting me.
- Of course.

16:19.895 --> 16:23.857
Um, so I have to ask, how
do you two know each other?

16:24.024 --> 16:26.485
- Bree called me a hack.
- What?

16:26.652 --> 16:29.238
- I did not.
- You said my novel was...

16:29.405 --> 16:32.950
- page-turning and interesting.
- Oh, you really did call him a hack.

16:33.117 --> 16:35.327
She then invited me to her bookstore.

16:35.494 --> 16:37.705
- And then?
- And...

16:37.871 --> 16:39.415
I was not a good guest.

16:39.873 --> 16:40.916
Oh.

16:41.083 --> 16:44.044
But I was hoping for an
opportunity to redeem myself.

16:44.211 --> 16:48.590
- Oh, I love sequels.
- Of course you do.

16:48.757 --> 16:50.968
- I will see you guys later.
- Okay.

16:53.637 --> 16:55.723
I loved your play.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.767
How the crushing of
the rose symbolized...

16:58.934 --> 17:01.895
how our pasts haunt our present is...

17:02.062 --> 17:03.772
Thank you.

17:04.272 --> 17:06.066
Yes.

17:07.108 --> 17:11.571
Well, Bree, it's been
nice seeing you, so...

17:12.239 --> 17:14.782
It's what? I'm... That's it?

17:14.950 --> 17:16.326
You're just gonna... ?

17:16.492 --> 17:19.496
- You're not gonna... ?
- I didn't think I'd actually see you...

17:19.663 --> 17:22.750
and if I did, I was certain you
would not want to talk to me...

17:22.915 --> 17:25.127
- so I'm completely unprepared.
- Mmm.

17:25.294 --> 17:26.962
- Oh, which is a lie.
- Yes.

17:27.128 --> 17:29.381
I rehearsed, but I've lost every word...

17:29.548 --> 17:34.094
though I'm fairly certain that
"sorry" punctuated multiple sentences.

17:34.261 --> 17:38.474
Oh, well, that sounds
interesting and page-turning.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.977
Right, yes. And so
I'll cut to the chase.

17:42.686 --> 17:45.647
Sending in your manuscript
to my publisher was a mistake.

17:45.814 --> 17:47.399
I'm not Martin.

17:47.566 --> 17:50.235
I would still undoubtedly
dislike Martin intensely...

17:50.402 --> 17:53.238
and you look absolutely stunning.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.158
Well...

17:56.575 --> 17:58.744
that's not even remotely hackish.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.413
But while our pasts do
indeed haunt our present...

18:01.580 --> 18:05.501
I was hoping that it wouldn't
necessarily affect our future.

18:11.882 --> 18:17.721
Whoa, look, it's robber baron
Mick O'Brien stealing tools.

18:18.055 --> 18:21.266
I left them here when I was
helping Trace with the Bridge.

18:21.433 --> 18:24.728
Considering the fact you were
involved in remodeling the place...

18:24.895 --> 18:26.897
I'm surprised it's still standing.

18:27.064 --> 18:29.775
To be honest with you, so am I.

18:29.942 --> 18:35.280
- So you back in town now?
- For a little bit, yeah.

18:37.157 --> 18:38.700
So...

18:39.785 --> 18:42.162
you wanna talk about the trust?

18:42.329 --> 18:43.413
Not really.

18:43.580 --> 18:46.750
I figure you'll honor
the original deal anyway.

18:46.917 --> 18:50.254
It took a while to convince
Douglas, but, uh, ultimately...

18:50.420 --> 18:52.840
But you can be very persuasive?

18:53.006 --> 18:54.550
When I need to be, yes.

18:54.716 --> 18:58.470
But maybe not very good when
it doesn't suit your interest.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.722
You're not very good
at getting to the point.

19:01.181 --> 19:02.270
I'm just saying that maybe

19:02.271 --> 19:05.310
you didn't try all that
hard to help Connor out.

19:05.477 --> 19:08.856
I tried very hard. And considering
your name is on the door...

19:09.022 --> 19:11.066
maybe you should have
owned that mistake.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.734
I have, believe me.

19:13.652 --> 19:17.156
So now you need to sit down
with Connor and clear the air.

19:17.322 --> 19:20.159
You figured that out how? From
all your years of parenting?

19:20.325 --> 19:22.369
No, but from having
the same father as you.

19:22.536 --> 19:26.582
- Hey, Mick! Look who's here.
- Robin, hey.

19:26.748 --> 19:30.252
- Gosh, what a long time.
- Yeah, 13 years.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.441
I went to visit her
in Arizona last year.

19:32.442 --> 19:34.923
Remember that little clinic she started?

19:35.090 --> 19:36.633
Fifteen doctors now.

19:36.800 --> 19:40.179
- My favorite part was our hike in Sedona.
- And that Red Canyon Spa day.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.723
Sounds nice. What
brings you back here?

19:42.890 --> 19:44.308
We're heading to Bali.

19:44.474 --> 19:47.019
To renew their vows. Which reminds me...

19:47.186 --> 19:48.896
- I have a surprise for you.
- Oh.

19:49.062 --> 19:51.190
- Come on. In the car.
- Yeah?

19:52.816 --> 19:55.569
- What?
- Hmm? Nothing.

19:56.486 --> 19:58.197
All right.

20:07.998 --> 20:10.834
I know you're going to tell
me to give the letter back.

20:11.001 --> 20:12.669
Uh, yeah, but...

20:14.046 --> 20:15.339
well...

20:15.505 --> 20:17.633
yeah, you should probably give it back.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.303
Was that a statement or a question?

20:21.470 --> 20:25.724
It was a little bit of both.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.479
You know, last night, I saw...

20:32.481 --> 20:34.149
I don't even know what I saw.

20:34.316 --> 20:38.070
Thing is, I remember how I
was feeling when I wrote this.

20:38.528 --> 20:42.908
It was right when things were starting
to move really fast with Wes...

20:43.575 --> 20:47.560
and I wanted to tell Trace how I
was feeling and why I was feeling.

20:47.576 --> 20:50.061
And I don't remember what I said...

20:50.062 --> 20:51.276
and I'm worried that
maybe I said too much.

20:52.834 --> 20:55.587
Why didn't he open it?

20:56.046 --> 20:58.966
Oh, I wish I'd never,
ever found this letter.

20:59.132 --> 21:01.301
And I wish I never saw it.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.280
Two bedroom, one bath.

21:05.281 --> 21:07.766
I can write off the
other room as an office.

21:07.933 --> 21:11.311
Does it have a fireplace?
Because if it does, don't rent it.

21:11.478 --> 21:14.064
Uh, no, but the building has a pool.

21:14.231 --> 21:15.607
- Oh, hey, Connor.
- Hey.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.734
Um, I need to talk to you about boys.

21:17.901 --> 21:19.069
Seriously?

21:19.236 --> 21:21.071
Yes, I need your valuable advice.

21:21.238 --> 21:24.366
- Absolutely. Being a boy, I'm an expert.
- Great, so...

21:25.325 --> 21:27.411
- I ran into Simon.
- You what?

21:27.577 --> 21:30.247
I ran into Simon at my
play, or Simon ran into me.

21:30.414 --> 21:32.040
- How'd the play go?
- He loved it...

21:32.207 --> 21:34.626
- and understood the ending.
- What was the ending?

21:34.793 --> 21:37.921
I'm starting to feel I've been
wrong about him and what he did.

21:38.088 --> 21:40.674
- Simon's in Baltimore?
- I wasn't being fair to him...

21:40.841 --> 21:44.928
because I saw him as Martin, and,
really, he's nothing like Martin.

21:45.095 --> 21:46.763
So I might have invited him here.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.641
- Might have?
- I said it low, I'm not sure he heard.

21:49.808 --> 21:52.602
- So, what do I do?
- If you call, e-mail or text...

21:52.769 --> 21:54.938
it's a double invite,
which looks desperate.

21:55.105 --> 21:57.816
If you don't do anything and
he didn't hear from you...

21:57.983 --> 22:01.278
you missed your chance, so
if you wanna see him again...

22:01.445 --> 22:03.822
- you have to...
- Text as if he's someone else.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.485
Apologize. When he texts back,

22:05.486 --> 22:07.410
text that you're
excited to hear from him.

22:07.576 --> 22:10.245
Then turn off your
phone, wait one hour...

22:10.412 --> 22:12.331
and see what happens.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.710
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

22:21.715 --> 22:23.550
Hello, Trace.

22:23.717 --> 22:26.303
Dad, what are you doing here?

22:26.636 --> 22:28.930
- Last box, I promise.
- Heh.

22:29.097 --> 22:31.850
Your mother and I found some
of your old baseball cards.

22:32.017 --> 22:35.562
- Place is looking good, Trace.
- Thanks.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.147
- Something to drink?
- Coffee?

22:37.314 --> 22:38.356
Yeah.

22:38.523 --> 22:41.902
- I can't believe you kept those cards.
- I've got something to show you.

22:42.069 --> 22:44.279
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.868
Reggie Jackson, 1969.

22:50.035 --> 22:52.579
You bought me that for my 11th birthday.

22:52.746 --> 22:55.582
I remember. Mr. October.

22:55.749 --> 22:57.501
Here. Let me see that.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.505
Talk about ambition.

23:01.671 --> 23:04.132
He left everything in Oakland
to make it in New York.

23:04.299 --> 23:06.718
I think that's why
you liked him so much.

23:07.135 --> 23:09.012
Must have been.

23:11.264 --> 23:14.935
You know, Trace, I know why
you collected these old cards.

23:16.603 --> 23:20.732
Because it was my thing too, right?
Gave us something to talk about.

23:20.899 --> 23:22.442
Yeah.

23:22.609 --> 23:24.319
Honestly...

23:24.486 --> 23:27.864
deep down, I thought
you were gonna make it.

23:31.618 --> 23:36.289
- Let me see these cards.
- All right. Who you got there? Hm?

23:36.456 --> 23:38.792
- These are mint condition.
- Dennis Eckersley.

23:38.959 --> 23:41.336
- Yeah.
- Remember that sidearm? Heh.

23:41.503 --> 23:44.756
That was not... Hey, that
was not the worst part.

23:44.923 --> 23:46.210
When I started to learn the alphabet,

23:46.211 --> 23:48.930
Kevin would come teach me my ABCs.

23:49.094 --> 23:51.763
- That's not bad, that's actually nice.
- Right?

23:51.930 --> 23:55.976
Oh, yeah. Yeah. How does the
song go? A, B, C, D, E, F, P?

23:57.477 --> 23:59.938
Funny now, but it was
humiliating in kindergarten.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.649
He got me back. He put red
food-coloring in my soap...

24:02.816 --> 24:06.194
- before my date with Betsy Will.
- She asked if he was contagious.

24:08.321 --> 24:09.865
Okay, well...

24:10.031 --> 24:11.107
the day I became a firefighter,

24:11.108 --> 24:13.830
I stayed at my parents'
on a blow-up mattress.

24:13.994 --> 24:17.247
And at night, my brothers picked
it up and put it in the pool.

24:17.414 --> 24:19.124
- Classic.
- Nice wake-up call.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.501
It was November, and
they took out the plug.

24:21.668 --> 24:22.961
Ooh.

24:24.045 --> 24:25.130
No stories, Danielle?

24:26.590 --> 24:27.750
Mmm, not really.

24:27.751 --> 24:30.510
My brother and I kind of
stayed out of each other's way.

24:34.264 --> 24:36.474
- We should do this again some time.
- Mm-hm.

24:36.641 --> 24:39.352
Yeah, next time, maybe we
should do it in Baltimore.

24:39.519 --> 24:42.063
- You must know places, Danielle.
- Maybe, it's just...

24:42.230 --> 24:45.567
It's so hard to find time. I'm
literally working every night this week.

24:47.402 --> 24:50.530
- Really?
- I literally haven't left the office before 10.

24:53.658 --> 24:56.328
Well, hey, I
know what that feels like.

24:57.454 --> 25:01.583
Have your picture taken
with our beloved mayor...

25:01.750 --> 25:04.252
and make a wish.

25:05.545 --> 25:07.005
Hey.

25:07.172 --> 25:09.716
Oh, thank you. Four? Okay, here you are.

25:10.300 --> 25:13.720
- Here. Make it good.
- Looks like it's going well, huh?

25:13.887 --> 25:15.138
It's great.

25:15.305 --> 25:18.725
I hear
that Robin's back in town.

25:18.892 --> 25:21.937
She is. We're having
lunch with Mick and Thomas.

25:22.103 --> 25:24.648
- Oh, good.
- Come on. Why don't you join us?

25:25.190 --> 25:28.235
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

25:29.778 --> 25:33.365
Nell, it's been 10 years. I
know she'd love to see you.

25:33.531 --> 25:37.244
You know, I have to wait. I have
to wait for Abby and for Trace.

25:37.410 --> 25:40.747
And then there's a whole bunch of
errands that I really must run today.

25:40.914 --> 25:43.625
But you enjoy, okay? Okay.

25:43.792 --> 25:48.255
Oh, welcome. Here you
are. Four wishes for you.

25:48.421 --> 25:49.798
Make them good, okay?

25:49.965 --> 25:51.925
There she is. Fun times.

25:52.092 --> 25:54.094
- Hi, Gran.
- Oh, you're late.

25:54.261 --> 25:55.553
I'm sorry.

25:55.720 --> 25:58.223
- Aw, thank you for coming, Trace.
- Yeah, of course.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.434
- I appreciate you being here.
- No problem. Good to see you.

26:01.601 --> 26:03.186
- Thank you.
- Uh, you're leaving?

26:03.812 --> 26:06.147
Well, you know, heh...

26:06.314 --> 26:09.359
politicians need to be the
stewards of the community.

26:09.526 --> 26:11.778
And they need to follow
the will of the people.

26:11.945 --> 26:15.532
- Gran, what?
- Well, I think, begosh and begorrah...

26:15.699 --> 26:17.993
that our beloved mayor...

26:18.159 --> 26:20.245
- needs to follow my lead.
- Ha-ha.

26:20.412 --> 26:21.871
You have fun, okay?

26:22.038 --> 26:23.873
Okay.

26:24.708 --> 26:27.419
- How did she rope you into this?
- She gave me my schedule.

26:27.585 --> 26:30.630
- Told her I had plans, she told me I didn't.
- Right.

26:30.797 --> 26:32.424
Here you go.

26:32.966 --> 26:36.636
Hey, ahem, do you ever think about...

26:36.803 --> 26:39.973
what would have happened if
I'd come back from New York?

26:40.140 --> 26:41.558
Sometimes.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.560
Like, what would've happened...

26:43.727 --> 26:47.063
if you hadn't found out
I was with Wes? Or...

26:47.230 --> 26:50.608
what if we had actually talked
when you came to New York?

26:50.775 --> 26:51.818
I don't know.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.988
Maybe we'd be different people.

26:55.155 --> 26:57.490
But something tells me
I'd still be here with you.

26:58.158 --> 27:00.827
- Really?
- Really.

27:01.661 --> 27:04.205
- And happy?
- Obviously.

27:04.372 --> 27:07.042
I mean, we're happy now, aren't we?

27:07.751 --> 27:08.793
Mm-hm.

27:08.960 --> 27:13.131
Abby, no matter what happens, or
how crazy it gets on the road...

27:14.257 --> 27:16.092
I'll always be there for you.

27:21.348 --> 27:23.725
You know, you could buy a book.

27:23.892 --> 27:25.352
- Do I get the family rate?
- Yup.

27:25.518 --> 27:27.771
- Nice.
- Retail plus 10 percent.

27:27.937 --> 27:30.357
- Wait, what?
- I gotta pay for the place.

27:31.024 --> 27:33.485
Hey, how was your
double date, by the way?

27:33.651 --> 27:36.029
Oh, it was great. It was totally great.

27:36.196 --> 27:39.699
I wanna stop by the fountain before
I pick up the keys to my new place.

27:39.866 --> 27:42.118
- Awesome.
- Heh-heh.

27:42.994 --> 27:45.038
- Oh, hello, Connor.
- Cheerios.

27:46.164 --> 27:48.875
I don't think he knows what that means.

27:50.585 --> 27:51.753
So you did hear me.

27:52.712 --> 27:54.547
No. No, I didn't.

27:54.714 --> 27:57.258
But I did enjoy the series of texts.

27:57.425 --> 27:58.760
Especially the part...

27:58.927 --> 28:02.490
- where you turned your phone off for an hour.
- I didn't do that.

28:02.491 --> 28:03.491
- Mm-mm.
- Oh, no?

28:03.640 --> 28:05.475
- Really?
- No.

28:05.642 --> 28:07.435
- Oh, really?
- No.

28:10.146 --> 28:14.526
Um, so, what's new? Are you
writing Eternal Caroline?

28:15.068 --> 28:16.986
Carry on, Caroline?
Caroline in Carolina?

28:17.153 --> 28:18.613
Wrong on all three counts...

28:18.780 --> 28:21.282
- though I might write that last one.
- Ha.

28:21.449 --> 28:26.287
No, I'm taking a break from
Caroline, penning a new novel. Uh...

28:26.454 --> 28:31.501
Definitely a more serious
work, Dublin's Last Sunset.

28:31.668 --> 28:34.504
A purely uninteresting and
decidedly uncommercial piece...

28:34.671 --> 28:36.965
that will most assuredly fail.

28:37.132 --> 28:38.925
- Really?
- Mm.

28:39.592 --> 28:42.011
- Good for you.
- Well, thanks to you...

28:42.178 --> 28:44.055
I will be broke, homeless...

28:44.222 --> 28:46.349
- but artistically satisfied.
- Thanks to me?

28:46.516 --> 28:48.852
It was the multiple times
being called a hack...

28:49.018 --> 28:52.105
by a fabulously-talented writer.

28:52.981 --> 28:57.110
- By the way, I love the new place.
- I know!

28:59.571 --> 29:02.365
So the actual ceremony is
called the mekala-kalaan...

29:02.532 --> 29:05.869
- which we're gonna do at sunset in Bali.
- Oh, so romantic.

29:06.035 --> 29:07.704
- Where you had your honeymoon?
- Yup.

29:07.871 --> 29:10.915
What's it been? Can
it be 30 years already?

29:11.082 --> 29:12.333
Thirty.

29:12.500 --> 29:14.002
And after Bali, what then?

29:14.544 --> 29:17.422
I'm gonna spend as much
time as I can in Arizona.

29:17.589 --> 29:20.759
I'm going to adjust my
schedule to be with Thomas.

29:21.384 --> 29:22.594
Oh, good for you.

29:26.055 --> 29:28.767
I'm sorry, this is our travel agent.

29:29.934 --> 29:31.060
Oh, you know what?

29:31.061 --> 29:33.563
That makes me realize, I
forgot to make a phone call.

29:33.730 --> 29:35.982
- Be right back.
- Okay.

29:36.149 --> 29:38.943
Some things never change. Heh-heh.

29:39.110 --> 29:41.488
Nothing really changes
around here either, does it?

29:41.654 --> 29:45.116
Wow. Thirty years, Robin.
That's pretty wonderful.

29:45.283 --> 29:47.994
- It is, but it's been tough.
- Mm.

29:48.161 --> 29:50.303
We spent the majority of our marriage

29:50.304 --> 29:52.165
trying to figure out how to save it.

29:53.208 --> 29:56.294
- So why'd you stay married?
- Because we love each other.

29:56.461 --> 29:58.630
Neither of us wanna give
up on the good things.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.257
- I'm happy for you.
Mm-hm. - Thank you.

30:01.424 --> 30:05.094
So, um, is that why you came back here?

30:06.471 --> 30:08.723
What? Mick and me? Oh, no.

30:11.267 --> 30:12.936
I just came back for the kids.

30:14.479 --> 30:16.250
Really. When Abby came home,

30:16.251 --> 30:19.150
we all just managed to
find our way back here.

30:19.317 --> 30:21.986
Yeah, that's... That's all.

30:22.153 --> 30:25.240
- Yes, that is all.
- Fine. Okay.

30:29.035 --> 30:31.955
So, what prompted you guys to try again?

30:32.497 --> 30:36.459
Well, I started to think about
it when I saw Megan back in town.

30:36.626 --> 30:40.505
- Yeah, but we're not together anymore.
- I know, but still you...

30:40.880 --> 30:42.882
There's a chance for something.

30:43.049 --> 30:45.301
And then Robin and I started to talk.

30:46.094 --> 30:49.430
And I realized that we
deserve something more.

30:49.597 --> 30:51.724
You've tried before.

30:51.891 --> 30:53.685
And this time, we're gonna try harder.

30:54.310 --> 30:55.895
What?

30:56.062 --> 30:59.399
Well, it just seems that after
30 years of trying harder...

30:59.566 --> 31:00.984
Same thing over and over...

31:01.150 --> 31:04.153
expecting different results,
definition of insanity?

31:06.155 --> 31:08.575
Something like that, yeah.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.869
Thanks for the support, Mick.

31:16.749 --> 31:19.043
What do you think about
a purging ceremony?

31:19.586 --> 31:20.795
What?

31:21.671 --> 31:24.299
Well, day three...

31:24.465 --> 31:26.593
David still hasn't called...

31:26.759 --> 31:29.721
which means he probably fell
off the face of the Earth.

31:29.888 --> 31:32.056
Which isn't flat, I know.

31:32.223 --> 31:33.850
But I wonder if I could just...

31:34.017 --> 31:36.728
take all my problems,
put them in one place...

31:36.895 --> 31:39.063
set them on fire...

31:39.230 --> 31:42.066
and then, poof, they'd be gone.

31:42.233 --> 31:46.779
- Ha-ha. I don't think it works like that.
- Tsk. I know.

31:46.946 --> 31:49.032
- But it'd great, wouldn't it?
- Oh, yeah.

31:49.198 --> 31:51.910
It would be great.

31:52.952 --> 31:54.370
What do you think, Kev?

31:54.537 --> 31:56.205
Purging ceremony?

31:56.372 --> 31:59.584
Throwing all my troubles into
a fire and setting them free?

31:59.751 --> 32:01.502
I've tried that. It doesn't work.

32:02.211 --> 32:05.214
People always have secrets.

32:17.352 --> 32:20.480
How you guys doing? Hey,
good to see you again.

32:20.647 --> 32:22.398
Have a good night.

32:25.360 --> 32:26.986
How's it going?

32:27.153 --> 32:28.780
I got the jet.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.782
Wheels up at 9.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.700
You coming or not?

32:32.867 --> 32:34.327
About that, um...

32:34.911 --> 32:38.164
I don't think it's such a good
idea for me to leave right now.

32:39.082 --> 32:42.210
Trace, people tell themselves
all sorts of things...

32:42.377 --> 32:44.629
to make them feel
better about their lives.

32:45.004 --> 32:47.131
Maybe you're not helping anyone.

32:47.298 --> 32:49.008
Maybe you're just hurting her.

32:50.635 --> 32:51.720
I don't know about all that.

32:51.721 --> 32:54.514
I stayed in Chesapeake
Shores for one reason.

32:55.306 --> 32:56.557
Abby.

32:56.724 --> 32:58.643
She's the love of my life.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.228
Yeah, I know.

33:00.395 --> 33:04.065
You're not gonna give up, you
and Abby are gonna make it work.

33:04.232 --> 33:07.026
Trust me. You're me 20 years ago.

33:07.694 --> 33:10.947
- And you're happy now?
- It's all I ever wanted.

33:11.656 --> 33:12.824
I'm doing it.

33:14.200 --> 33:17.120
I wish somebody told me back
then what I'm gonna tell you now:

33:17.286 --> 33:18.830
Sometimes...

33:18.997 --> 33:21.207
it's better to just pull the Band-Aid.

33:26.087 --> 33:28.923
Tim, Luke, Willie.

33:30.299 --> 33:33.302
It's a real nice jet, Trace.

33:34.178 --> 33:37.015
Free champagne. Heh.

33:41.060 --> 33:42.854
Man.

33:45.106 --> 33:48.526
Maybe the last one will
be Bon Voyage, Caroline.

33:48.693 --> 33:53.406
- Or Rest in Peace, Caroline.
- Oh, even better.

33:54.157 --> 33:55.742
Mmm.

33:56.534 --> 33:57.577
How are you, Bree?

33:58.953 --> 34:01.873
I'm fine.

34:03.166 --> 34:05.168
You know, not great.

34:05.334 --> 34:07.712
Editing the novel has been...

34:07.879 --> 34:09.380
tricky.

34:09.547 --> 34:12.341
- How so?
- Well...

34:12.507 --> 34:15.553
I'm 1-for-2 with my family reading
themselves into my characters.

34:15.719 --> 34:18.347
Two-for-two when Abby
reads it, I'm sure.

34:18.514 --> 34:21.353
- But they're not them.
- But they are... in a way, and that's fine.

34:24.103 --> 34:27.482
You write what you know, and
you're close to your family.

34:27.648 --> 34:30.150
I'll remember that when
they run me out of town.

34:30.318 --> 34:32.695
Ah, look.

34:32.862 --> 34:35.447
I know that you would
never try to hurt anyone.

34:35.614 --> 34:38.242
And in time, maybe your
family will see that too.

34:38.409 --> 34:40.078
Is that what happened with yours?

34:40.244 --> 34:41.746
When I wrote The Red Palace...

34:41.913 --> 34:44.665
my obsession with the Russian
Revolution was so off-putting...

34:44.831 --> 34:48.460
I don't think anyone in
my family got past page 24.

34:48.628 --> 34:50.838
I should have written
about the Ming dynasty.

35:03.559 --> 35:04.602
- Ah!
- Oh!

35:04.769 --> 35:07.438
- Oh, I didn't mean to scare you.
- Oh. Oh...

35:10.191 --> 35:12.819
- Ah, how was your lunch?
- It was great.

35:12.985 --> 35:15.196
- And I brought you some cherry pie.
- Ooh.

35:15.363 --> 35:18.032
Thank you, Megan.

35:18.199 --> 35:22.537
You know, I thought sure that this
would get the mayor's attention.

35:22.703 --> 35:25.665
That poor guy. He never should
have picked a fight with you.

35:28.251 --> 35:30.503
Ah, well...

35:30.670 --> 35:34.966
So you think at some point maybe
you might wanna talk to Robin?

35:35.133 --> 35:36.175
Why?

35:36.968 --> 35:38.344
Because she's here.

35:39.428 --> 35:41.222
She's not here.

35:41.389 --> 35:42.723
Not really.

35:42.890 --> 35:44.100
Not for long.

35:44.267 --> 35:46.686
Maybe this time will be different.

35:47.770 --> 35:51.023
Megan, you know, you have to...
You have to close a lot of doors...

35:51.190 --> 35:53.943
- before you can open a new door.
- Mm-hm.

35:54.110 --> 35:58.906
It seems to me like Robin and Thomas
are always opening the same door.

35:59.323 --> 36:01.075
And that's why you don't like her?

36:01.242 --> 36:02.910
I don't dislike Robin.

36:03.661 --> 36:06.372
- She's... She's a good woman.
- Mm-hm.

36:06.539 --> 36:09.667
It's just that as a
parent, I'm a parent...

36:09.834 --> 36:12.795
and I want more than
anything in the whole world...

36:12.962 --> 36:14.755
for my child to be happy.

36:14.922 --> 36:19.177
And I don't think Robin ever has,
ever could, or ever will do that.

36:21.679 --> 36:22.889
Oh.

36:23.389 --> 36:24.682
Your pie.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.311
I'm sorry.

36:28.477 --> 36:30.354
Thank you, Megan.

36:31.105 --> 36:32.690
Thank you.

36:33.566 --> 36:35.359
Excuse me.

36:35.526 --> 36:37.904
- How's it going?
- Good, hey.

36:38.070 --> 36:41.073
The four of us should get
together again. That was fun.

36:42.491 --> 36:44.660
Take over for a second.

36:46.162 --> 36:47.705
Um...

36:47.872 --> 36:49.123
Come here.

36:49.290 --> 36:52.418
You know the other day when I went
to Baltimore to drop Bree off...

36:52.585 --> 36:54.545
- at the theater?
- Yeah.

36:56.589 --> 36:59.217
I saw Danielle come out of
a restaurant with some guy.

36:59.383 --> 37:00.551
So?

37:00.718 --> 37:01.920
Well, the other day at Sally's,

37:01.921 --> 37:04.972
she said that she never left the office.

37:05.306 --> 37:06.724
It's just an expression.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.685
Yeah.

37:10.144 --> 37:11.812
But they seemed close.

37:12.480 --> 37:14.357
Maybe it doesn't mean anything...

37:14.523 --> 37:17.777
but you're my brother, I
don't want to see you get hurt.

37:18.277 --> 37:21.739
So you see my girlfriend coming
out of a restaurant with a guy...

37:21.906 --> 37:25.451
automatically assume she's cheating,
and you don't want me to be hurt?

37:25.618 --> 37:28.454
I never said that she
was cheating, I'm just...

37:28.621 --> 37:32.458
- telling you what I saw, to protect you.
- Oh, protect me? Right.

37:32.625 --> 37:34.877
Well, thank you. Thank
you very much, Kevin.

37:35.044 --> 37:37.964
While you're at it, you should
keep an eye on those two.

37:38.130 --> 37:40.591
They've been scoping out
coins in the fountain...

37:40.758 --> 37:43.135
and I think they're
about to make their move.

37:49.725 --> 37:52.561
Uh, you know the other day...

37:52.728 --> 37:56.899
when you asked me if everything
was fine and I said it was?

37:57.066 --> 37:58.734
Um...

37:59.860 --> 38:01.821
It wasn't.

38:05.449 --> 38:09.745
I've been thinking a lot about
the week before Wes proposed.

38:11.414 --> 38:12.873
Abby, heh...

38:13.040 --> 38:15.334
we don't have to go back there.

38:15.501 --> 38:18.879
- I like where we are.
- No, me too.

38:19.046 --> 38:20.673
Me too.

38:22.550 --> 38:24.427
But...

38:25.219 --> 38:28.681
when we were going through
your boxes from the attic...

38:29.140 --> 38:32.018
I found this.

38:35.688 --> 38:36.731
You never opened it.

38:38.065 --> 38:40.568
I got it when I came back from New York.

38:40.735 --> 38:43.529
I didn't want to. I
didn't see the point.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.074
Weren't you curious?

38:47.241 --> 38:48.659
I was.

38:49.952 --> 38:53.873
But I saw the way you looked at Wes,
and I just wanted you to be happy.

38:56.584 --> 38:59.628
Whatever you wrote, it
wasn't gonna change anything.

39:04.592 --> 39:06.385
Well, you kept it.

39:08.471 --> 39:10.431
Because it was from you.

39:15.770 --> 39:17.563
So...

39:19.523 --> 39:22.026
do you want me to open it?

39:22.193 --> 39:23.778
No. Heh.

39:23.944 --> 39:25.780
Then what do you want to do with it?

39:25.946 --> 39:28.282
It's time for us to let go of the past.

39:40.878 --> 39:42.588
There.

39:46.967 --> 39:49.136
- Okay.
- Yeah.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.098
Okay.

39:59.814 --> 40:02.316

- Thank you very much.
- Thanks.

Hey, Danielle, how are you?

40:39.145 --> 40:41.105
Yeah, I just signed
off on the new place.

40:41.272 --> 40:44.900
I miss you. Do you wanna
get together tonight?

40:45.943 --> 40:48.279
Okay, well, tomorrow, then?

40:49.530 --> 40:50.739
Oh.

40:50.906 --> 40:52.890
Okay, well, I'll give you
a call tomorrow afternoon,

40:52.891 --> 40:55.369
and we'll figure something out.

40:56.245 --> 40:57.413
Okay.

40:57.580 --> 40:59.165
Okay, bye.

41:00.749 --> 41:02.126
So how are you doing?

41:02.918 --> 41:04.879
Okay, I guess.

41:05.045 --> 41:06.797
Connor's not doing so well, though.

41:06.964 --> 41:10.301
He somehow turned this into blaming me.

41:10.801 --> 41:13.846
Yeah, sometimes doing
the right thing stinks.

41:17.224 --> 41:20.144
Hey. Oh, thank you.

The last time we were boxing books...

41:57.389 --> 42:00.351
things didn't turn out
exactly as I'd hoped.

42:00.518 --> 42:03.062
Oh, well, now that we
are unboxing books...

42:03.229 --> 42:05.439
how would you like it to turn out?

42:05.606 --> 42:06.772
If I was writing it,

42:06.773 --> 42:09.777
I would leave it open-ended
so there could be a sequel.

42:09.944 --> 42:11.487
Hey.

42:11.654 --> 42:13.822
- I love sequels.
- I know you do.

42:14.532 --> 42:17.618
Maybe instead of a sequel,
though, we could just...

42:17.785 --> 42:20.246
add a few more chapters.

42:21.205 --> 42:23.415
So this story does continue?

42:23.582 --> 42:27.294
I mean, I am kind of intrigued
to see what could happen.

42:27.461 --> 42:28.796
Yeah, so am I.

42:28.963 --> 42:32.091
I much prefer stories
with a happy ending.

42:32.258 --> 42:34.552
Oh. Oh, you think that's
where this is going?

42:34.718 --> 42:37.054
Oh. Well, this is a first draft.

42:37.221 --> 42:40.724
- I'm hopeful.
- It does read well.

42:40.891 --> 42:42.685
Honestly...

42:43.352 --> 42:45.354
I think this is some of my best work.

42:51.235 --> 42:53.153
He misses me!

42:53.320 --> 42:55.239
Aah! I got a letter.

42:55.406 --> 42:58.367
He was traveling, and
he didn't have a signal.

42:58.534 --> 43:00.995
Oh, did I just interrupt? I totally did.

43:01.161 --> 43:03.747
I can wait unless you don't want me to.

43:03.914 --> 43:06.333
- Wow, this is really awkward.
- Hi, Jess.

43:06.500 --> 43:09.253
David's inviting us to
Maine to meet his parents.

43:09.420 --> 43:11.463
- Us?
- No, Bree and me.

43:11.630 --> 43:15.009
- Me?
- Okay, they didn't really invite you...

43:15.175 --> 43:18.178
and I don't really want to
be around you right now...

43:18.345 --> 43:22.683
but I need you, and you
owe me, so I'm inviting you.

43:23.183 --> 43:25.311
Oddly, that makes sense.

43:25.477 --> 43:26.812
- Maine!
- Yeah.

43:26.979 --> 43:30.441
- We're going to Maine. Aah! Ooh! Ungh!
- Okay.

43:34.862 --> 43:37.364
So, uh, Maine.

43:37.531 --> 43:38.574
Apparently.

43:44.121 --> 43:47.708
I didn't realize they put
a sail on the S.S. Minnow.

43:49.501 --> 43:51.545
That's funny. That's very funny.

43:51.712 --> 43:53.714
You should try comedy.

43:53.881 --> 43:55.549
How'd you find me?

43:55.716 --> 43:59.345
Unless you're planning on
floating your bedroom in the bay...

43:59.511 --> 44:03.182
or you're terrified of barnacles
growing on your front door...

44:03.349 --> 44:04.975
there's really no need to...

44:05.643 --> 44:09.438
coat your home in antifouling paint.

44:10.689 --> 44:12.441
What do you think?

44:12.608 --> 44:14.777
Eh. It's nice.

44:15.194 --> 44:17.780
It's gonna need a lot of work.

44:18.447 --> 44:20.199
How's the electrical and the pumps?

44:20.991 --> 44:22.534
A mess.

44:24.078 --> 44:27.456
- The deck and the joints?
- Worse.

44:27.623 --> 44:28.666
Heh.

44:33.504 --> 44:36.924
- You know, I'm still angry.
- Yeah, I know.

44:37.091 --> 44:40.761
You have no right to tell
me how to live my life.

44:40.928 --> 44:42.554
You're my brother.

44:43.972 --> 44:45.391
What about your son?

44:47.184 --> 44:49.395
Connor's a whole different story.

45:03.826 --> 45:07.162
You remember Dad's Pearson 38?

45:08.288 --> 45:10.457
I loved that boat.

45:10.624 --> 45:14.002
It's the only time I'd
ever get to talk to him.

45:14.169 --> 45:18.507
Well, more likely, the only
time he'd ever talk to me.

45:20.384 --> 45:21.468
How's the rigging?

45:22.678 --> 45:23.929
Rotten.

45:26.306 --> 45:28.600
But you know, like all boats...

45:28.767 --> 45:32.312
- there's always something to do.
- Ain't that the truth?

45:33.105 --> 45:35.524
But it's going to be good.

45:36.859 --> 45:38.277
It's gonna be good.

46:24.615 --> 46:26.783
Next time on Chesapeake Shores:

46:26.950 --> 46:29.369
- You can always come with me.
- I'm no groupie.

46:29.536 --> 46:31.455
- That's not fair.
- Let's do something else.

46:31.622 --> 46:34.625
- Fine, not like he's our dad.
- Dad, Mom, Alex.

46:34.791 --> 46:36.543
Meet my girlfriend, Jess.

46:36.710 --> 46:39.338
I know you'll do what's
best for you and the family.

46:39.505 --> 46:42.508
- You're wrong about Danielle.
- You know, at least I tried.

46:42.509 --> 46:44.009
You're not seeing someone else, are you?
