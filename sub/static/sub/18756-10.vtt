WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:04.004
(jaunty string music)

00:06.240 --> 00:07.808
- (laughing)

00:07.841 --> 00:10.311
- Good morning, lovebirds.
- Hi.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.246
- Bad news, the Adelmans' flight
was cancelled,

00:12.280 --> 00:14.348
so you might have to re-tweak
the seating chart.

00:14.382 --> 00:17.251
- Okay.
(sighs)

00:17.285 --> 00:19.053
So we're gonna need to
find a new spot

00:19.087 --> 00:21.855
for, uh, Tom's in-laws,
Ed and Trish.

00:21.889 --> 00:24.325
- Okay.
Who do they know?

00:24.358 --> 00:27.761
- Uh, maybe one of the uncles at
the uncles and teachers table.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.663
- Good!
Good, done.

00:29.697 --> 00:32.500
Uh, next up is Julie F.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.202
She's my mom's dentist.

00:34.235 --> 00:37.671
- Your-your mom's dentist.
Who does she know?

00:37.705 --> 00:40.074
- Uh, I'm gonna put her at
the West Coast relatives table.

00:40.108 --> 00:41.775
- Cool, cool.
That just leaves us

00:41.809 --> 00:44.245
with a spot to find for Mark.

00:44.278 --> 00:45.713
- Who does he know?
- Uh, no one.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.115
He, uh, woke up this morning

00:47.148 --> 00:48.749
after being in a coma
since 1987.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.618
- Oh. (sighs)
Okay, uh,

00:50.651 --> 00:52.786
could we squeeze him at a table
with one of your coworkers?

00:52.820 --> 00:55.223
- (sighs) I mean, all those guys
talk about is basketball.

00:55.256 --> 00:56.424
Mark won't know
any of the players.

00:56.457 --> 00:57.625
Most of them weren't even born

00:57.658 --> 00:59.093
when the air conditioner
fell on his head.

00:59.127 --> 01:00.394
- Who shrunk this television?

01:00.428 --> 01:02.130
- We could put him on our table?

01:02.163 --> 01:05.366
- Okay, well, to be honest,
we're not that close.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.268
Like, I've hung out with him
a few times,

01:07.301 --> 01:09.103
help the orderlies
trim his nails and stuff,

01:09.137 --> 01:12.039
but I never had, like, a real
conversation conversation.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.374
- But he is family, right?
- That's true.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.143
Hey, uh, cousin Mark.
- Hi.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.644
- Who are you people?

01:16.677 --> 01:18.646
- Cool.
- Yeah, that's-that's good.

01:18.679 --> 01:21.649
What are we gonna do?
- (whispers) Ah, man.

01:21.682 --> 01:24.118
Oh, why don't we put him at
the coma patients table?

01:24.152 --> 01:25.119
- (gasps)

01:25.153 --> 01:26.554
(clank)
(yells)

01:26.587 --> 01:28.055
- Terrific idea.
I don't know why

01:28.088 --> 01:30.158
I didn't think of it
immediately.

01:30.191 --> 01:33.161
(downtempo electronic music)

01:33.194 --> 01:34.162
*

01:34.195 --> 01:35.496
- Aah!

01:35.529 --> 01:38.766
*

01:38.799 --> 01:40.801
- (squeaks)

01:40.834 --> 01:42.570
*

01:42.603 --> 01:44.104
- (growls)

01:44.138 --> 01:46.140
*

02:01.189 --> 02:04.024
- Jesus Christ,
does it have to be so tight?

02:04.057 --> 02:05.926
- Well, as the old saying goes,

02:05.959 --> 02:09.263
a snug bowtie means
a snug marriage.

02:09.297 --> 02:11.432
- Right.
- Is in the cards.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.501
For the two of you.
- O... Okay.

02:13.534 --> 02:16.136
- Good news, gentlemen,
the gas station down the street

02:16.170 --> 02:18.539
has a wide selection
of bum wine.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.274
- There's a bar open downstairs.

02:20.308 --> 02:22.276
- No, it's not open.
Trust me, I've been checking.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.511
- That's curious.

02:23.544 --> 02:24.612
Could've sworn
Lucy and I told them

02:24.645 --> 02:25.846
to open at noon.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.281
- Ah, don't worry
about it, Josh,

02:27.315 --> 02:29.817
you-you two had
so much to organize.

02:29.850 --> 02:32.986
There was bound to be
a couple of oopsy-daisies.

02:33.020 --> 02:35.989
(eerie music)

02:36.023 --> 02:37.525
*

02:37.558 --> 02:39.293
- Ow! God. Mom,

02:39.327 --> 02:42.129
how'd you ever walk down
the aisle in these?

02:42.162 --> 02:43.697
- Very carefully.

02:43.731 --> 02:46.166
- Hey, Lucy, wasn't there
supposed to be a vegan option

02:46.200 --> 02:47.535
for dinner tonight?
- There should be. Why?

02:47.568 --> 02:49.303
Is it not on the menu?

02:49.337 --> 02:51.572
- Both these entrees have
cream sauces.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.741
- You know Robin's extremely
lactose intolerant. - Yeah.

02:53.774 --> 02:56.344
- It's fine.
- No, it isn't, Robin.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.712
You get torrential diarrhea.

02:58.746 --> 03:02.316
- I can just take
Monday off from work.

03:02.350 --> 03:04.017
Monday and Tuesday.

03:04.051 --> 03:05.353
- No, Robin, you shouldn't
have to do that.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.987
There should be a vegan option.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.589
I swear Josh and I
asked for one.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.424
- Don't worry about it, darling,

03:10.458 --> 03:12.826
you and Josh had
so much to plan.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.929
There was bound to be
a couple of oopsy-daisies.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.965
*

03:20.634 --> 03:23.637
(phone rings)

03:24.738 --> 03:25.906
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.508
Can you meet me downstairs?

03:27.541 --> 03:29.243
I think there's
something weird going on.

03:29.277 --> 03:31.445
See? We did ask for
the bar to be open.

03:31.479 --> 03:32.946
- And we did ask for
a vegan option.

03:32.980 --> 03:36.284
- And what the hell are
these boring table settings?

03:36.317 --> 03:38.018
What happened to the funky
mismatched plates

03:38.051 --> 03:39.787
we got from the thrift store?

03:39.820 --> 03:41.622
- (laughs)

03:41.655 --> 03:43.291
- Josh.
- What?

03:43.324 --> 03:44.558
- Since when does my mom
hang out with your stepdad?

03:44.592 --> 03:45.626
- Something's amiss.

03:45.659 --> 03:48.629
(stealthy funk music)

03:48.662 --> 03:50.398
*

03:56.804 --> 03:59.773
(dramatic music)

03:59.807 --> 04:03.444
*

04:05.446 --> 04:07.481
- I hereby call to order

04:07.515 --> 04:10.318
this meeting of
the shadow wedding planners.

04:10.351 --> 04:14.254
As you all know,
it is our sworn duty

04:14.288 --> 04:15.956
to secretly control

04:15.989 --> 04:19.760
every aspect of this wedding.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.229
Together, we will transform it

04:22.262 --> 04:25.299
from a young,
cool person's thing

04:25.333 --> 04:28.902
into a normal
traditional wedding,

04:28.936 --> 04:32.640
where everything
is normal and nice.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.975
Brother Jim,
any updates on the reception?

04:35.008 --> 04:36.310
- Yes, Sister Patti.

04:36.344 --> 04:38.579
The pre-ceremony bar
has been closed.

04:38.612 --> 04:42.416
- The confusing vegan option
has been stricken from the menu.

04:42.450 --> 04:45.152
- And the funky mismatch plates

04:45.185 --> 04:47.755
are no more!

04:47.788 --> 04:49.823
(plates shatter)
- (gasps)

04:49.857 --> 04:52.626
- By the time our work is done,

04:52.660 --> 04:56.497
this will be the most normal
and nice wedding

04:56.530 --> 04:58.699
in the history

04:58.732 --> 05:01.134
of Evanston, Illinois!

05:01.168 --> 05:03.036
- Yep,
straight down the middle.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.873
(all laugh)
- You monsters!

05:05.906 --> 05:08.409
- This is our wedding!
We planned it.

05:09.543 --> 05:12.546
(all cackling)

05:19.152 --> 05:22.390
- Oh, Josh.
Oh, Lucy.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.992
You didn't plan this wedding.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.795
- From the very beginning,
you've just been our puppets.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.997
- Like wind-up dolls,
unaware that we were the ones

05:30.030 --> 05:31.899
spinning your gears.

05:31.932 --> 05:36.036
- Or like when a dog thinks
he's the one driving the car.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.243
- The point is,
behind the scenes,

05:43.276 --> 05:45.513
the real wedding decisions

05:45.546 --> 05:48.682
have always been made by us.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.984
- But what about
the wedding that we want?

05:51.018 --> 05:53.687
- It's too late.
The wedding we want

05:53.721 --> 05:57.057
starts in four hours.

05:57.090 --> 06:00.360
(all cackling)

06:00.394 --> 06:02.563
Throw them out!
- (demonic voice) Out!

06:02.596 --> 06:03.597
- Wow, oh, okay.
- Oh, God, okay.

06:03.631 --> 06:06.033
- To ultimate power!

06:06.066 --> 06:07.935
ALL: Power!
- (cackles)

06:11.405 --> 06:12.606
- This is blood.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.877
- Ow.
- Jesus. (groans)

06:16.910 --> 06:19.046
- And don't come back.

06:19.079 --> 06:22.382
(door slams shut)

06:22.416 --> 06:24.718
I'm your cousin, by the way,
from Arizona.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.587
I-I don't know
if you recognize me.

06:26.620 --> 06:29.389
It's been a really long time.
- No, I-I know who you are.

06:29.423 --> 06:31.559
Uh, Morris, good to see you.

06:31.592 --> 06:34.562
Uh, so did you have
a good trip up here?

06:34.595 --> 06:36.730
- The flight in was-was
really great.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.065
- Okay, good.
- Good.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.968
- The drive to the airport
wasn't so good.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.736
You know, traffic.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.104
- Yeah.

06:48.476 --> 06:51.579
- Sometimes, you know,
the drive is really great,

06:51.612 --> 06:54.381
and then the flight
isn't so good,

06:54.414 --> 06:56.584
but this, uh...
this was the opposite.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.586
This was-this was the opposite.
- Right.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.321
- Cool.
- Yeah - Yeah.

07:01.354 --> 07:04.458
- Mazel tov.

07:04.492 --> 07:05.793
(door slams shut)

07:08.428 --> 07:11.131
- (groans)
- I know!

07:11.164 --> 07:14.001
I-I really wanted our wedding
to feel like-like us, you know?

07:14.034 --> 07:15.503
And-and now it's just gonna be

07:15.536 --> 07:17.304
a bunch of shit
that our parents want,

07:17.337 --> 07:19.406
like that guy.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.109
- Who the hell's that again?
- That's the pastor they hired

07:22.142 --> 07:25.513
to make sure everything goes
the way they want it to.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.150
- Well, what...

07:30.183 --> 07:33.487
what if we told him his services
were no longer required?

07:33.521 --> 07:35.355
- What about our parents?
They-they want...

07:35.388 --> 07:36.757
- Who cares what
our parents want?

07:36.790 --> 07:40.694
This is our wedding, Lucy.

07:40.728 --> 07:42.630
Let's take it back.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.364
Okay, is everybody clear
on what they're doing?

07:44.397 --> 07:45.666
ALL: Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.000
- Awesome.
Okay, you guys are the best.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.468
Ready?
- All right, on three.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.704
- Let's do this! -R-Revised
wedding plan on three.

07:50.738 --> 07:53.541
ALL: Okay.
One, two, three,

07:53.574 --> 07:56.644
revised wedding plan!

07:56.677 --> 07:58.311
- Guys, I'm so honored
that you asked me

07:58.345 --> 08:00.447
to officiate your wedding.
(exhales)

08:00.480 --> 08:02.449
I just want to make sure
you want your ceremony

08:02.482 --> 08:04.685
to be so non-traditional.

08:04.718 --> 08:07.555
- Liz, all-all we care about
is that it's fun,

08:07.588 --> 08:09.790
and that it's personal to us.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.125
- But, uh, are-are you sure
you don't want to do

08:12.159 --> 08:13.661
at least something
a little religious?

08:13.694 --> 08:15.328
- What? Why?

08:15.362 --> 08:17.364
- Well, Mom sent us
to Hebrew school for nine years,

08:17.397 --> 08:19.499
and Lucy, aren't your parents
pretty Christian?

08:19.533 --> 08:20.734
- Yeah.

08:20.768 --> 08:22.135
- There's not a single
mention of God.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.804
- Liz, relax.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.706
Who's gonna notice?

08:25.739 --> 08:28.742
(divine organ music)

08:28.776 --> 08:30.377
*

08:30.410 --> 08:32.479
- Tom, tuck your shirt in.
God's here.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.682
- Nice to see you.
How are you?

08:34.715 --> 08:36.349
- God! Over here!

08:36.383 --> 08:37.918
- Patti, look at you.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.352
Sweetheart.
- Ooh!

08:39.386 --> 08:40.654
Oh-oh, you're so sweet.
- Aw.

08:40.688 --> 08:42.322
Caroline, congratulations.
- Aw. (giggles)

08:42.355 --> 08:43.657
- Jim, I'm very happy for you.
- Pleasure.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.258
- Oh, bless you.
- It's great, great.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.527
Tom, you're not
gambling, are you?

08:47.561 --> 08:50.731
It's so wonderful to have
a good old-fashioned

08:50.764 --> 08:52.600
religious wedding.
- Yes.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.334
- Uh, though it's not gonna be
so traditional, you know,

08:54.367 --> 08:56.269
with the Christian and
the Jewish, but I don't mind.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.906
Guys, I don't mind,
as long as you acknowledge me.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.941
Honor me in some way.
You understand.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.276
- Oh, of course.
- Obviously...

09:03.310 --> 09:04.745
- Yes.
- We're going to honor you.

09:04.778 --> 09:07.948
- Well, your mouth to my ear.
(all laugh)

09:07.981 --> 09:11.284
- Oh, God, let's sit down.
Sit down.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.353
- This is gonna be wonderful.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.789
(horn blares)

09:15.823 --> 09:17.457
- Ladies and gentlemen,

09:17.490 --> 09:21.729
put your paws together
for the wedding party!

09:21.762 --> 09:23.530
- * Listen, I'm trouble *

09:23.563 --> 09:25.633
* Yeah, yeah,
I can't keep still *

09:25.666 --> 09:28.636
* I can't keep still,
I can't keep still *

09:28.669 --> 09:30.237
- * Ah, ah *
- * Yeah, yeah *

09:30.270 --> 09:31.238
- * Addicted to morphine *

09:31.271 --> 09:34.708
- And now, Josh and Lucy!

09:34.742 --> 09:37.244
- * I can't keep still *

09:37.277 --> 09:38.946
* I'm trouble,
yeah, yeah, yeah *

09:38.979 --> 09:40.614
* I can't keep still *

09:40.648 --> 09:42.282
- * Ah, ah *
- * Yeah, yeah *

09:42.315 --> 09:45.085
* - Addicted to
morphine, yeah. *

09:45.118 --> 09:47.254
- (chuckles) Wow.
We are gathered here today

09:47.287 --> 09:50.824
to celebrate the marriage
of Josh and Lucy,

09:50.858 --> 09:53.226
in the witness
of friends, family,

09:53.260 --> 09:56.463
and the ultimate creator...

09:58.365 --> 10:00.668
...the energy of the universe.

10:00.701 --> 10:03.136
- What?

10:03.170 --> 10:06.139
- But first, a reading from
two dear friends of the bride,

10:06.173 --> 10:08.608
Meghan and Robin.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.410
- Well, maybe
this'll be a psalm.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.246
- You know, I was never much
a spiritual person,

10:13.280 --> 10:14.915
until last summer,

10:14.948 --> 10:18.819
when I went to Burning Man
and tried iowaska.

10:18.852 --> 10:21.454
And I was bowing before
the great Burning Man itself,

10:21.488 --> 10:25.959
which, if you've never been--
it's sort of like an idol?

10:25.993 --> 10:29.496
As I bowed before it,
I had a revelation,

10:29.529 --> 10:32.432
and that's when I wrote this.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.535
(clears throat)

10:35.568 --> 10:39.472
(bongo slaps)
(humming)

10:39.506 --> 10:42.375
* Hey *

10:42.409 --> 10:44.644
Each spirit is a changeling.

10:44.678 --> 10:47.314
Each has taken many shapes.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.649
My spirit once was
Joan of Arc's,

10:49.683 --> 10:52.019
and once a bunch of grapes.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.554
Each spirit must be thankful

10:54.587 --> 10:56.890
for that which leaves us odd.

10:56.924 --> 10:59.492
That holy force
that rules the world,

10:59.526 --> 11:03.396
the force that we call...
(bongo flourish)

11:03.430 --> 11:05.232
Love.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.534
- I'm doing the Xanax.
(pill container pops open)

11:07.567 --> 11:10.403
(mutters indistinctly)

11:10.437 --> 11:13.640
- And now their friend Chris
to say a few words.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.475
- Thank you.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.144
Growing up as a Christian,

11:17.177 --> 11:20.347
I attended church every Sunday,

11:20.380 --> 11:23.416
um, in a chapel
not too different from this one,

11:23.450 --> 11:27.420
and it always struck me
as so appropriate

11:27.454 --> 11:30.190
that church services
and wedding services

11:30.223 --> 11:33.660
would both take place
under the same roof.

11:33.693 --> 11:37.030
Both are about
bringing communities together

11:37.064 --> 11:39.332
to celebrate love--
the love of God,

11:39.366 --> 11:43.837
uh, or, like today,
the love between a couple.

11:43.871 --> 11:46.039
- I like this very much.

11:46.073 --> 11:50.077
- The Bible contains
many beautiful, uh, verses

11:50.110 --> 11:51.444
about marriage, of course.

11:51.478 --> 11:54.081
In fact,
just this morning in bed,

11:54.114 --> 11:56.917
I read one aloud
to my boyfriend.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.952
(thunder rumbles and booms)

11:58.986 --> 12:00.553
- Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

12:00.587 --> 12:03.757
- There's no need to apologize.
I'm fine.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.525
- Are you angry?
- I'm not angry!

12:05.558 --> 12:06.860
(thunder booms)
I'm not angry, okay?

12:06.894 --> 12:08.896
It's just I have to go.
Thank you.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.397
- You came all this way.

12:10.430 --> 12:11.564
Wouldn't you like
a glass of wine at least?

12:11.598 --> 12:13.566
- No.
Thank you very much.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.403
Everything was wonderful.
Congratulations to you all.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.271
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.273
- Thank you for coming.
- Thanks for coming, God.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.042
- Bye. - Bye.
- Bye, God.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.443
(car beeps)

12:23.476 --> 12:26.346
- Get... (stammers)
Damn it!

12:29.349 --> 12:32.352
(engine turning over)

12:33.620 --> 12:34.621
Aw, no!

12:34.654 --> 12:36.990
(engine sputters)
Damn it!

12:37.024 --> 12:38.291
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

12:38.325 --> 12:40.127
(line rings)
Nick!

12:40.160 --> 12:42.729
It's God!
Who the hell do you think it is?

12:42.762 --> 12:45.165
This piece of shit won't start!

12:45.198 --> 12:47.968
No! I don't have
Uber on my phone.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.837
I don't know
where the hell I am!

12:49.870 --> 12:51.771
I don't know. All I know is
the place smells like shit!

12:51.805 --> 12:54.107
They don't even have
a Starbucks here!

12:54.141 --> 12:56.776
I'm in the middle of nowhere!
Get me out of here!

12:58.545 --> 13:00.413
What?
- Oh...

13:00.447 --> 13:01.781
(all cheering)

13:01.815 --> 13:02.983
- Thanks, thanks.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.017
- Hey!
- Oh, my God!

13:04.051 --> 13:06.519
- Hey, sick-ass party, mofo!

13:06.553 --> 13:08.355
- (laughs)
- Hey.

13:08.388 --> 13:09.689
- You did great.
I loved your song.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.925
- That's great.
- Oh, it was so good.

13:11.959 --> 13:14.928
(somber music)

13:14.962 --> 13:17.998
*

13:30.310 --> 13:33.680
- They still look really down.
- Yeah, I know.

13:33.713 --> 13:34.814
I really haven't seen
Mom this sad

13:34.848 --> 13:38.351
since they cancelled
Boston Legal.

13:38.385 --> 13:40.120
- Yeah, my-my mom's
barely drunk.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.789
- Tom's on his fourth roll?

13:42.822 --> 13:44.057
- He's not even buttering them.

13:44.091 --> 13:46.726
- No, he's just
taking them down dry.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.461
- We should say something.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.864
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

13:50.898 --> 13:52.665
(glass clinking)

13:52.699 --> 13:54.134
- Hi there, hi there.

13:54.167 --> 13:58.005
It's, uh, Josh and Lucy from...
the wedding.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.640
- Hi. (giggles)
Uh, well, you guys, we did it.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.175
We got married.
We, uh... we did it

14:02.209 --> 14:03.810
just the way that we wanted to.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.412
- Um, but there's...
there's just...

14:05.445 --> 14:07.981
there's one more thing
that we, uh...

14:08.015 --> 14:10.817
we need to do.
- Yeah, and it might, uh...

14:10.850 --> 14:13.553
it might make our parents,
over here,

14:13.586 --> 14:15.188
a little bit uncomfortable.

14:15.222 --> 14:19.092
- All eyes on this table here.
- Just, uh, turn your attention.

14:19.126 --> 14:21.528
(clears throat) - We just
want to say thank you.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.563
Yeah, these are-these are
the people that raised us.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.698
- Yeah. How 'bout a round of
applause, huh?

14:25.732 --> 14:27.567
- That's right, yeah, get up!
Come on, get up.

14:27.600 --> 14:28.768
- Stand up.
- Take a bow, please.

14:28.801 --> 14:30.370
- Mom, come one, Mom.
(giggles)

14:30.403 --> 14:31.838
- Come on, Tom.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.841
(cheerful music)

14:34.874 --> 14:36.443
*

14:41.814 --> 14:43.416
Thank you.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.785
I love you, Mom.
I love you, Tom.

14:45.818 --> 14:47.720
- We love you.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.990
*

15:07.674 --> 15:08.908
- (laughs)
- Whoo!

15:08.942 --> 15:10.577
- Oh, God, what a day.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.645
- (groans)
- Hi.

15:12.679 --> 15:15.082
- Oh! Aw.
- The married couple.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.450
- Hey.
(all laugh)

15:17.484 --> 15:19.052
I can't believe we actually
pulled this thing off.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.954
- Yeah, no kidding, compared to
all this wedding stuff,

15:20.988 --> 15:22.389
being married's
gonna be a breeze.

15:22.422 --> 15:26.559
- Yeah, no kidding.
(all laugh)

15:26.593 --> 15:29.829
- What?
(laughter darkens)

15:29.862 --> 15:33.466
No?
- (monstrous growl)

15:33.500 --> 15:35.135
(crash and clatter)
- Aah!

15:35.168 --> 15:36.736
God! What the hell is that?

15:36.769 --> 15:38.505
- Looks like your first
challenge as a married couple.

15:38.538 --> 15:41.574
- (roars) Josh and Lucy,
I have come for you.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.910
Face me, face me.
- Okay, uh, how do...

15:43.943 --> 15:45.512
how do we... how do we
deal with this thing?

15:45.545 --> 15:48.948
- Well, you definitely
want to stab it in the eye.

15:48.982 --> 15:50.483
There ya go, Mrs. Greenberg.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.185
- Oh, and it hates fire.
- That's right.

15:52.219 --> 15:54.487
- So you might want
this flamethrower.

15:54.521 --> 15:57.457
- Oh, you brought it.
- That's so smart.

15:57.490 --> 16:00.693
- A shield is always handy.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.862
- Oh, okay, that's heavy.
(groans)

16:02.895 --> 16:04.197
- But honestly,
the most important thing

16:04.231 --> 16:05.498
is to just communicate.

16:05.532 --> 16:06.833
- Oh, yeah.
- Definitely.

16:06.866 --> 16:08.468
- Just talk to each other.
- Yeah.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.836
- (roars)

16:09.869 --> 16:11.204
- All right, guys,
let's do this.

16:11.238 --> 16:13.640
- Here we go.
- (roars)

16:13.673 --> 16:16.176
- Whoa.
Wait, are you not coming?

16:16.209 --> 16:17.810
- Oh, honey,
when it comes to marriage,

16:17.844 --> 16:19.679
you're really
kind of on your own.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.948
- Don't worry, we gave you
everything you need.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.650
- You're ready.

16:23.683 --> 16:24.817
- You are not ready.

16:24.851 --> 16:27.054
I will kill you
in a horrible way!

16:27.087 --> 16:28.988
- (sighs)
- Oh, don't listen to Gragdor.

16:29.022 --> 16:31.824
His bark is worse
than his many bites.

16:31.858 --> 16:33.160
- Make a fried calamari
out of him.

16:33.193 --> 16:35.162
- (growling)
- Okay.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.263
- On three?

16:38.265 --> 16:39.799
- Okay, on three.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.834
- One.
- Two.

16:41.868 --> 16:42.835
- (roars)

16:42.869 --> 16:45.772
- Three.
(both scream)

16:49.076 --> 16:50.677
- Okay.
- Okay, hey, did we remember

16:50.710 --> 16:52.179
Ed and Trish?
- Yes, I did.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.381
Uh, did you remember
your mother's dentist?

16:54.414 --> 16:55.382
- Yes, I did.
I drew a little picture

16:55.415 --> 16:56.583
of a tooth saying, "Thanks."

16:56.616 --> 16:58.385
- Aw, that's a really good idea.
- Mm-hmm.

16:58.418 --> 17:01.020
- Um, I think that's all
of our thank yous done.

17:03.090 --> 17:04.891
That is that.

17:04.924 --> 17:08.161
- What do we do now?
- Uh...

17:08.195 --> 17:10.163
want to take a walk?

17:10.197 --> 17:12.232
- I would love to.

17:12.265 --> 17:15.268
(thunder rumbling)

17:17.404 --> 17:18.938
(sighs)

17:18.971 --> 17:22.409
(enchanting music)

17:22.442 --> 17:25.011
- Oh, hey.
- Hmm?

17:25.044 --> 17:27.080
- * One, two, three *

17:27.114 --> 17:28.448
*

17:28.481 --> 17:29.482
(bird squawks)

(bird squawks)

17:34.587 --> 17:35.855
(bird squawks)

17:35.888 --> 17:37.124
(splat)

17:49.068 --> 17:52.038
- * We follow the river *

17:52.071 --> 17:54.707
* Down to the sea *

17:54.741 --> 17:57.410
* Showing the city *

17:57.444 --> 17:59.612

17:59.646 --> 18:02.215

18:02.249 --> 18:04.951

18:04.984 --> 18:07.720
