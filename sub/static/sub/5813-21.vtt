WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:06.265
You both know who we might need
to help deal with The Darkness.

00:06.965 --> 00:09.809
You're Metatron? The Metatron?

00:10.093 --> 00:12.642
I'm not an archangel.
I'm the Scribe of God.

00:12.846 --> 00:13.972
Chuck Shurley?

00:14.264 --> 00:15.704
He's a prophet of the Lord.

00:15.807 --> 00:17.525
I don't know how prophets are chosen.

00:18.644 --> 00:19.816
I don't want to be a prophet.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.146
No, you don't at all.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.403
- Obviously, I'm a god.
- You're not a god.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.108
God...

00:25.275 --> 00:28.654
I'm hoping that you and I can finish
what I started a few months ago.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.448
You weren't alone in the beginning.
Your sister was with you.

00:31.949 --> 00:34.793
I was the beginning,
and I will be the end.

00:34.993 --> 00:36.461
I will be all that there is.

00:36.662 --> 00:39.461
We're bonded.
You're the one who set me free.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.296
Our priority is to set Lucifer
loose on Amara.

00:42.501 --> 00:45.971
After we exorcise Lucifer out of Cass
and put him into a new vessel.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.807
Useless.
Lucifer's hold on him is too strong.

00:49.967 --> 00:53.141
Archangel plus God power
doesn't trump God sister.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.398
I think you and I
need to have a nice long chat.

00:57.391 --> 01:00.315
If Amara wipes the slate,
everything is destroyed.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.147
My partner and I
have seen this before, okay?

01:03.355 --> 01:06.825
Wes, Deputy Harris,
were infected by something in this fog.

01:07.192 --> 01:09.866
The amulet,
it burns hot in God's presence.

01:10.153 --> 01:12.201
/mean,
that's why you're back, right?

01:12.489 --> 01:15.413
This isn't her story. It's mine.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.337
What the hell is going on here, exactly?

01:26.712 --> 01:29.181
I'm happy to fill in the blanks.

01:29.381 --> 01:31.901
But maybe we should go somewhere
where we can actually sit down.

01:32.009 --> 01:34.262
We're not going anywhere with you.

01:34.511 --> 01:37.731
Okay, how do we even know that
you're really Chuck and not just some

01:37.931 --> 01:40.434
crazy spell or manifestation...

01:46.732 --> 01:47.779
Kevin?

01:48.233 --> 01:52.238
Guys. You're looking stressed.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.620
Especially you.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.753
It's cool. Trust Chuck.

02:00.203 --> 02:03.878
Whatever it is he needs you to do,
he must think you can handle it.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.133
I always trusted you.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.056
Yeah, that ended well.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.886
How did you... Are you okay?

02:17.888 --> 02:20.767
Yeah. I mean, you know,
given the circumstances.

02:20.974 --> 02:24.228
Yeah, I don't mean to interrupt.
Kind of a plateful here.

02:24.394 --> 02:27.819
And Kevin,
you've been in the Veil long enough.

02:28.065 --> 02:30.568
It's time you had an upgrade.

02:48.585 --> 02:49.837
Holy crap.

02:57.761 --> 03:03.359
Okay. So, well, Chuck.
I guess we don't call you that, huh?

03:03.600 --> 03:04.601
I prefer it.

03:05.811 --> 03:07.108
Okay, "Chuck" it is.

03:11.608 --> 03:16.785
I'm sorry, you're gonna have to give
Dean and me a moment to start to process.

03:16.988 --> 03:18.661
We didn't even know you were around.

03:18.865 --> 03:23.621
I mean, we knew about Chuck,
but we just didn't know about "Chuck."

03:23.829 --> 03:26.708
I mean, I was hoping that you were around,

03:26.957 --> 03:30.632
I prayed and I don't know if they got lost
in the spam or...

03:30.836 --> 03:32.053
- Sam.
- Yeah?

03:32.295 --> 03:33.512
- Babbling.
- Okay.

03:36.174 --> 03:39.303
I'm getting that
not everyone's totally on board.

03:44.975 --> 03:48.821
Here's the thing, Chuck.

03:51.815 --> 03:54.534
And I mean no disrespect.

03:56.570 --> 04:00.325
I'm guessing you came back to help with
The Darkness, and that's great.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.744
That's, you know... That's fantastic.

04:05.078 --> 04:09.379
But you've been gone, um...
A long, long time

04:10.375 --> 04:12.673
and there's so much crap

04:12.878 --> 04:17.678
that has gone down on the Earth
for thousands of years.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.889
I mean, the plagues and wars, slaughters.

04:24.681 --> 04:28.527
And you were, I don't know, writing books?

04:29.603 --> 04:31.605
Going to fan conventions?

04:32.564 --> 04:35.067
Were you even aware?
Or did you just tune it out?

04:37.527 --> 04:40.246
- I was aware, Dean.
- But you did nothing.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.041
And again,
I'm not trying to piss you off, you know.

04:43.241 --> 04:44.584
I don't wanna turn into a pillar of salt.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.628
I actually... I didn't do that.

04:48.789 --> 04:49.915
Okay.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.051
People pray to you.

04:56.046 --> 05:00.927
People build churches for you.
They fight wars in your name.

05:01.426 --> 05:02.769
And you did nothing.

05:04.763 --> 05:09.485
You're frustrated, I get it.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.442
Believe me, I was hands-on.

05:14.064 --> 05:19.241
Real hands-on for, wow, ages.

05:20.445 --> 05:26.498
I was so sure if I kept stepping in,
teaching, punishing,

05:27.828 --> 05:33.756
these beautiful creatures
that I created would grow up.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.844
But it only stayed the same.

05:38.088 --> 05:44.141
And I saw that I needed to step away
and let my baby find its way.

05:45.971 --> 05:49.020
Being over-involved
is no longer parenting.

05:51.768 --> 05:52.815
It's enabling.

05:55.647 --> 05:57.320
But it didn't get better.

05:58.275 --> 06:05.033
Well, I've been mulling it over,
and from where I sit, I think it has.

06:10.287 --> 06:11.334
Well, from where I sit,

06:11.538 --> 06:13.961
it feels like you left us
and you're trying to justify it.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.547
I know you had
a complicated upbringing, Dean,

06:21.172 --> 06:23.095
but don't confuse me with your dad.

06:43.028 --> 06:48.785
End your suffering, Lucifer.
Call out to him, beg him to save you.

06:53.330 --> 06:57.506
You want me to beg Daddy
to come rescue his screw-up of a son?

06:59.294 --> 07:05.893
I'm no fan of Pop's,
but he did make all of...

07:06.635 --> 07:08.558
You know, everything.

07:09.387 --> 07:12.231
That's something that you could never do.

07:12.641 --> 07:15.690
Because all you ever wanted was nothing.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.396
It's not too inspiring, is it?

07:19.856 --> 07:24.737
You're strong, Amara,
and you may defeat him.

07:27.656 --> 07:30.330
But you'll never be him.

07:31.868 --> 07:35.748
You have to understand this
about The Darkness, she's relentless.

07:35.997 --> 07:38.375
A force beyond human comprehension.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.383
It's the only reason
I came off the sidelines.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.265
Must've been great being her brother, huh?

07:42.379 --> 07:43.676
It was the worst.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.349
Always telling me what to do,
making me do what she wanted.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.029
I mean, you guys know how that works.

07:51.096 --> 07:52.222
So, where is she?

07:53.223 --> 07:55.225
No freaking idea, fellas.

07:55.767 --> 07:58.236
She's warded herself
specifically against me.

07:59.688 --> 08:00.940
What've you come up with?

08:02.774 --> 08:05.197
Zip. And we've been at it for months.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.955
Well, matter of time.

08:11.282 --> 08:12.579
I've always had faith in you.

08:14.411 --> 08:15.913
Even if you didn't return the favor.

08:17.414 --> 08:20.588
Where's the guest room?
I could use a shower.

08:20.917 --> 08:24.763
It's, uh... It's just down the hallway.
Fourth door on the left.

08:29.634 --> 08:35.640
Hey, Chuck.
You know that she's got Lucifer, right?

08:36.808 --> 08:37.933
Uh-huh.

08:41.730 --> 08:44.232
The way we heard it, um,

08:44.441 --> 08:46.660
last time when you
bottled up The Darkness,

08:47.986 --> 08:49.579
it took more than just you.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.999
I mean, we heard that
Lucifer was involved.

08:53.825 --> 08:56.294
- No.
- No?

08:58.663 --> 09:02.634
Lucifer was, perhaps, my greatest hope,
and my bitterest disappointment.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.260
Do you think
if I could've trusted him for a moment

09:04.461 --> 09:05.838
I would've put him in the Cage?

09:06.087 --> 09:08.967
And I wasn't gonna mention this,
but thank you so much for springing him.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.848
That wasn't really the plan.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.640
Now, as bad as he was,

09:13.845 --> 09:17.600
after all this time in prison,
he's probably worse.

09:17.807 --> 09:20.481
And by now,
he could've formed an alliance with Amara.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.358
Not walking into that trap, guys.

09:23.271 --> 09:24.989
So, no!

09:29.360 --> 09:31.158
Thus spake the Lord.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.162
- Something's out there.
- Hmm.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.005
Always is.

09:41.164 --> 09:44.043
This is new. Somethings changed.

09:44.501 --> 09:47.004
Maybe Dad picked up
on your latest slaughter-fest.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.134
Spoiled brat.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.716
I needed solitude
and he needed a fan club.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.970
So he made all that,

09:55.178 --> 09:58.853
and when I complained,
he stuffed me in a hole for eons.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.183
With your help.

10:01.351 --> 10:02.568
Stop whining.

10:04.562 --> 10:05.688
I don't need this.

10:38.555 --> 10:39.898
Come on, Amara. Where are you?

10:42.934 --> 10:44.777
I've missed you, Dean.

10:45.728 --> 10:48.732
It's been a while since we've spoken.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.782
I'm aware my brother has surfaced.

10:53.778 --> 10:58.124
If you should cross paths,
if he should reach out to you,

10:58.741 --> 11:00.539
he should know this.

11:01.077 --> 11:05.958
Lucifer, his favorite,
isn't doing so well.

11:08.293 --> 11:13.094
To say nothing of the vessel,
your friend Castiel.

11:13.298 --> 11:18.099
By choosing to ignore me,
my brother is allowing this to happen.

11:19.470 --> 11:23.100
These, and other things.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.110
I thought you should know.

12:23.201 --> 12:24.327
Anything?

12:24.494 --> 12:25.620
Nada.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.215
- Yeah, thanks for the...
- Yeah.

12:31.459 --> 12:32.836
You know,
I can't believe I'm gonna say this,

12:33.002 --> 12:35.881
but, for once,
I actually wish Rowena was here.

12:36.673 --> 12:39.176
I mean, maybe she could track down Amara.
She's done it before.

12:39.384 --> 12:41.227
Yeah, but you can bet she and The Book
are gonna stay stashed

12:41.469 --> 12:43.221
until this whole thing is over.

12:46.516 --> 12:47.563
Where's Chuck?

12:50.061 --> 12:51.529
Sleeping in, I guess?

12:52.230 --> 12:53.698
Does God sleep?

12:55.733 --> 12:57.531
I know he takes really long showers.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.362
- Right? And sings, too.
- Yeah.

12:59.529 --> 13:02.533
Like, crappy old folk songs.
I had to tell him to cool it three times.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.038
You told God to "cool it"?

13:05.702 --> 13:07.204
Yeah, I sleep.

13:09.706 --> 13:13.552
You know, I know this is
a really strange situation and all,

13:13.793 --> 13:17.138
but it's also really amazing, you know?

13:17.338 --> 13:18.885
I mean, it's God.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.475
There're so many things I wanna ask him.

13:20.675 --> 13:23.053
Like, the planets, you know,
why are they round?

13:23.219 --> 13:24.939
Or ears.
I always thought they were strange.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.140
Okay, fanboy. Calm down.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.395
Let's stay focused.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.481
We gotta find Lucifer
before it's too late.

13:31.477 --> 13:32.569
Too late?

13:34.981 --> 13:39.487
Amara is... She's in my head.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.579
Hey, I didn't ask for it, okay?
She just showed up.

13:41.738 --> 13:45.083
But she's shown me visions of Lucifer.
By "Lucifer," I mean Cass.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.078
He looks like crap.
Like, she's really doing a number on him.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.838
Shh. Hey. Morning.

13:52.707 --> 13:53.754
Is that my robe?

13:54.709 --> 13:56.586
I'm telling you guys,

13:56.836 --> 13:59.089
it's a mistake
to get mixed up with Lucifer.

13:59.339 --> 14:03.094
Much as it pained me, I had to walk away.
Too much drama.

14:03.718 --> 14:04.765
Do you have any bacon?

14:05.595 --> 14:07.597
- You eat bacon?
- Yeah.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.020
Hey, guys, this just came up.

14:10.266 --> 14:16.194
Looks like that fog, the Amara fog,
uh, hit another town.

14:16.939 --> 14:18.031
And?

14:18.274 --> 14:20.652
And this one wasn't
as lucky as the last one.

14:21.444 --> 14:26.792
Thousands died. Uh, everybody died.
Uh, except for one man.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.125
How'd you miss that one?

14:28.618 --> 14:31.588
She's baiting me.
I can't respond every time.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.215
- I won't be manipulated.
- Yeah, but thousands of people are dead.

14:34.415 --> 14:37.464
Unfortunately. So find her.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.590
We have
breaking news at this hour

14:42.799 --> 14:45.143
on the most recent freak weather event.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.645
State police are now confirming that

14:47.804 --> 14:52.776
a mysterious toxic fog engulfed the town
of Lewis, Oklahoma late last night.

14:52.975 --> 14:56.320
Reports are also confirmed
that there were mass fatalities.

14:56.479 --> 14:59.983
Descriptions of the event are identical
to those of the fog

15:00.233 --> 15:02.577
that overwhelmed
another town in the days...

15:29.262 --> 15:30.309
What?

15:30.596 --> 15:33.770
I notice you've been in touch with Chuck.

15:35.017 --> 15:39.443
Well, I've got some information
you're gonna need to know.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.358
Okay, say it.

15:42.525 --> 15:46.621
No, it's gotta be in person.
Something I gotta show you.

15:50.658 --> 15:51.705
Gentlemen.

15:51.868 --> 15:55.213
Professor Redfield? FBI.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.884
- Call me Donatello.
- Ah.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.548
I'm named after him.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.884
The Mutant Ninja Turtle?

16:06.382 --> 16:08.384
The Renaissance sculptor.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.387
Right. Of course.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.730
The cops think I'm a terrorist.
I teach chemistry at the university.

16:19.896 --> 16:24.572
I lead a quiet life. I have a cat!
Had a cat.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.156
Well, we are sorry for your loss.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.071
Just a few questions.

16:28.237 --> 16:31.741
Other than the fog,
did you notice anything or anyone

16:31.991 --> 16:34.164
that seemed out of place
on the street that night?

16:35.536 --> 16:37.504
It all happened so fast. I had...

16:38.372 --> 16:39.919
It was like it came out of nowhere.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.419
We hardly ever get fog,
and never like that.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.258
It was horrible.

16:45.755 --> 16:49.430
They were clutching their throats
like they were choking.

16:53.554 --> 16:56.398
And their bodies... Oh, my God.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.399
These terrible black streaks.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.696
And that's when it happened.

17:07.859 --> 17:10.204
It was like nothing I've ever felt
before in my life!

17:10.404 --> 17:11.763
It was like my head was exploding.

17:11.864 --> 17:16.619
Oh, only, not with pain...
 With knowledge and clarity!

17:16.786 --> 17:18.253
Things that I'd never known before.

17:18.454 --> 17:22.800
Symbols and voices.
In languages I don't speak!

17:28.214 --> 17:35.223
And then, horrible, horrible visions

17:37.974 --> 17:42.275
of destruction and death.

17:46.774 --> 17:47.946
You think I'm crazy.

17:48.901 --> 17:53.156
No, not at all. Just...
Yeah, will you give us a moment?

17:58.077 --> 18:00.125
You get that
this is all sounding familiar, right?

18:00.329 --> 18:02.673
Yeah. Yeah, like when Kevin found out
he was a prophet.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.155
So what? This guy's a prophet?

18:04.333 --> 18:06.176
Yeah, but I thought
Crowley rounded up all the future prophets

18:06.419 --> 18:07.511
and tried to kill them?

18:07.962 --> 18:11.262
Yeah, but we rescued 'em,
and Donatello wasn't a part of that.

18:11.465 --> 18:13.342
But yeah,
it's possible Crowley missed a few.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.433
And obviously, he had no idea
he was next in line after Kevin, and so...

18:16.512 --> 18:18.952
How would he?
He hadn't gotten hit by the God power yet.

18:20.433 --> 18:24.188
Amara's fog...
Could it have been Amara's God power?

18:25.605 --> 18:26.982
It's still God power.

18:28.691 --> 18:30.989
- All right, I need a coffee.
- Yep.

18:37.700 --> 18:38.872
Am... Am I under arrest?

18:40.369 --> 18:45.170
No, just, um, want to check out
a few more aspects of your story.

18:45.374 --> 18:49.675
Here we go. Would you look at this?
Try and read it a little?

18:52.214 --> 18:55.013
I can't.
I don't know anything about it.

18:55.885 --> 18:58.229
"Behold the face of God."

18:58.387 --> 19:01.482
That came right to me.
Who speaks this language?

19:01.724 --> 19:02.850
Angels.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.695
I need to see you, Dean.

19:08.230 --> 19:11.575
Events are moving swiftly
and everything will change.

19:12.485 --> 19:16.410
I need to meet with you,
but not like this.

19:17.573 --> 19:18.825
Somewhere alone.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.055
I can't be a prophet,
I'm an atheist and a chemist.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.851
I believe in molecules, not God.

19:38.052 --> 19:40.430
Well, we're pretty sure the prophets
don't even know they're in the game

19:40.596 --> 19:42.769
until they've actually
been touched by God. It's...

19:43.099 --> 19:44.271
I was touched by God?

19:44.517 --> 19:46.440
Or possibly his sister, Amara.

19:46.644 --> 19:47.941
- He has family?
- Yeah.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.265
She wants him gone
so she can annihilate the universe.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.569
- That's the headline.
- What?

19:51.774 --> 19:54.653
And since you might have a hotline to her,
we're hoping you can help us find her.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.020
Why would you wanna find her?

19:56.195 --> 19:58.493
- We gotta rescue this guy she's holding.
- Who is?

19:58.698 --> 19:59.745
- Lucifer.
- Her nephew.

19:59.949 --> 20:02.372
- Who is possessing an angel at the moment.
- Yeah.

20:05.079 --> 20:07.423
It's locked. Yeah, that too.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.172
Sometimes we keep
monsters in the back.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.136
- I can't do this.
- Yeah, you can.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.249
No, I promise you, I can't.

20:13.337 --> 20:16.011
Look, we can't force you to do this.
You've gotta want this.

20:16.382 --> 20:19.135
It's like asking me
to believe in Santa Claus!

20:19.385 --> 20:20.432
- Well, actually...
- Dean, not now.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.139
Okay, look, we're not asking you
to believe that this is true.

20:23.347 --> 20:26.442
Just act like you do.
People do it all the time.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.521
What's that?

20:30.688 --> 20:32.065
I don't know.

20:32.857 --> 20:35.827
I think I'm sensing something.
Something big.

20:36.026 --> 20:37.152
Like Amara?

20:37.653 --> 20:41.032
I don't think so.
Although, how would I know?

20:42.616 --> 20:47.543
Could it be... Him?

20:59.300 --> 21:00.392
Hey, Chuck.

21:01.385 --> 21:06.266
We found someone.
I think he's the next prophet.

21:07.850 --> 21:08.897
Neato.

21:12.855 --> 21:13.947
Is that my computer?

21:14.565 --> 21:16.067
I've never seen so much porn.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.112
Not in one sitting.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.250
I'm gonna...

21:27.119 --> 21:31.920
So, listen, he's a little nutted out
about the whole booga-booga of it all,

21:32.124 --> 21:34.798
so maybe just dial back
the God stuff.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.807
So... No pants on. Sam!

21:40.007 --> 21:41.429
- Yep.
- Yep.

21:47.765 --> 21:48.812
Now you're safe.

21:54.271 --> 21:57.445
Donatello, good to see you.
Sorry about your cat.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.953
You know me?

22:01.612 --> 22:05.583
I made you. I made all of you.
Even the ones who aren't born yet.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.205
Oh, my God. It's you.

22:11.789 --> 22:14.417
Good to meet you, sir.
Your celestial magnificence.

22:14.625 --> 22:16.385
- Your, your all...
- Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.929
He just kind of goes by "Chuck."

22:19.630 --> 22:21.974
So, we good? You all signed up?

22:23.634 --> 22:27.264
I guess you know that I was an atheist.

22:28.055 --> 22:32.185
Until 10 minutes ago. Is that an issue?

22:32.434 --> 22:33.481
Not for me.

22:33.644 --> 22:37.114
I mean, I believe in me.
But your skepticism is to be expected.

22:37.523 --> 22:39.571
I did include "free will" in the kit.

22:43.904 --> 22:45.156
Welcome aboard.

22:54.915 --> 23:01.093
Oh, uh... Barkeep? Dos margaritas,
top-shelf tequila, please, for my amigos.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.132
Their treat.

23:04.300 --> 23:07.474
All right, we're here.
Don't try to pull any crap.

23:08.220 --> 23:12.646
And what variety of crap
could I possibly pull?

23:12.850 --> 23:14.477
I've lost my grace.

23:15.311 --> 23:16.483
Look at me. I got nothing.

23:16.687 --> 23:19.987
Okay, why did you have to see us?
What's so urgent?

23:22.693 --> 23:27.290
So I noticed
you've been in touch with Chuck.

23:28.365 --> 23:30.413
- Aka You-Know-Who.
- Yeah, yeah.

23:30.618 --> 23:33.542
Is this going anywhere?
Yes, Chuck agreed to take on Amara.

23:34.371 --> 23:36.465
He said that? Used those words?

23:36.749 --> 23:37.796
Pretty much.

23:38.834 --> 23:41.713
- Huh.
- So, what? He's not confronting Amara?

23:42.087 --> 23:46.638
No. No, no, no. He's gonna meet with her.

23:48.052 --> 23:50.054
He's just not gonna take her down.

23:53.390 --> 23:59.818
He's gonna sacrifice himself.
Let her do whatever she wants with him.

24:01.023 --> 24:02.991
Do you really expect us to buy this?

24:04.944 --> 24:07.367
No, of course not.

24:08.906 --> 24:12.331
Here. Buy this.

24:17.289 --> 24:20.133
Ignore the typos, but read it.
It's in his own words.

24:21.585 --> 24:25.965
It's not an autobiography.
It's a suicide note.

24:44.024 --> 24:45.116
You wanted to talk.

24:47.111 --> 24:48.511
This seemed as good a place as any.

24:52.324 --> 24:55.077
Look at them. Endlessly optimistic.

24:55.285 --> 24:58.255
The wind blows over his tower,
he rebuilds.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.175
Always gets me.

25:03.293 --> 25:05.011
If that's so, why are you bailing?

25:11.051 --> 25:13.474
When you see Amara,
you're throwing in the towel?

25:16.473 --> 25:20.148
Metatron. Loose lips.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.150
Well, you think I'm a dick.
Why do you care?

25:27.276 --> 25:32.282
Because before you went MIA,
you did a lot.

25:34.825 --> 25:36.668
Thank you.

25:36.869 --> 25:39.998
And what you call "throwing in the towel,"
I call "strategy."

25:42.499 --> 25:44.467
How is death by your sister a strategy?

25:44.668 --> 25:48.548
I know her. Her beef is with me.

25:51.175 --> 25:56.022
Yeah, but I still don't understand
how dying is a blueprint for success.

25:56.221 --> 25:59.316
I won't be dying, I'll be Caged.

26:00.225 --> 26:05.698
I trade myself for everything I created.
It goes on.

26:09.193 --> 26:10.866
Okay, well, the, um...

26:12.071 --> 26:18.420
Amara that I know
is a mountain of pissed off.

26:19.161 --> 26:20.879
I mean, she's spent
a gazillion years in solitary.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.503
The only thing she's thinking
is it's her turn.

26:23.832 --> 26:27.177
And I'll give it to her
as long as she accepts the deal.

26:27.711 --> 26:28.963
The deal?

26:30.172 --> 26:31.344
She's gonna eliminate you,

26:31.548 --> 26:33.346
and then she's gonna destroy
everything that you've created.

26:33.550 --> 26:34.847
She's told me this personally.

26:39.640 --> 26:42.735
Look, you started this.
You started all of this.

26:43.727 --> 26:45.900
But does that
give you the right to end it?

26:46.688 --> 26:49.862
You know,
we're not just some toys you throw away.

26:50.734 --> 26:53.203
I think you owe us more than that.

26:55.030 --> 26:58.785
If my plan doesn't work,
then humans will step up.

27:01.161 --> 27:06.668
You, Sam, others that are the chosen
will have to find a way.

27:09.378 --> 27:11.631
It's why I saved you years ago.

27:15.342 --> 27:18.391
You're the firewall
between light and darkness.

27:20.889 --> 27:23.392
No, no, I...

27:24.852 --> 27:27.196
Look, give me a vampire and I'm good.

27:27.396 --> 27:30.024
But this? God's sister?

27:30.983 --> 27:32.656
That is way above my pay grade.

27:36.864 --> 27:40.744
Bottom line is,
it's you who has to take her out.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.041
And, look, and then after that,

27:43.203 --> 27:45.922
you know, get a condo in Cancun.
I don't care!

27:53.297 --> 27:56.346
Got you a beer. I don't know if you drink.

27:56.550 --> 27:57.802
I do now.

28:00.721 --> 28:02.268
Well...

28:07.603 --> 28:10.857
I don't know if Chuck is leaning our way.

28:11.231 --> 28:12.323
You don't know?

28:12.983 --> 28:16.954
If we do get Lucifer for the added muscle,

28:18.572 --> 28:19.994
then maybe he'll play ball.

28:20.199 --> 28:21.621
I thought they hated each other.

28:22.326 --> 28:23.828
Yeah, they do.

28:24.203 --> 28:27.377
Wow, I so miss being an atheist.

28:27.789 --> 28:31.839
All right, Metatron, make it quick,
don't touch anything.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.546
Fine.

28:33.754 --> 28:37.804
- Dean! Thanks for inviting me.
- Inviting you?

28:38.425 --> 28:39.642
You've been circling
the building all night.

28:39.843 --> 28:42.346
You sent me 200 text messages
with dumb-ass emojis.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.101
You got three minutes.

28:45.265 --> 28:46.517
Donatello.

28:48.185 --> 28:51.940
Pleasure to meet you.
Metatron, Scribe of God.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.326
I was there
when you were designed.

28:56.318 --> 29:00.323
I wrote your name
on the inside of the angels' eyelids.

29:01.657 --> 29:03.079
- He's freaking me out.
- Okay.

29:03.283 --> 29:04.403
You said you wanted to help.

29:04.576 --> 29:07.500
Besides world-class douchery,
what do you have to offer?

29:07.704 --> 29:09.047
Oh, nothing.

29:09.248 --> 29:12.798
I just transcribed the angel tablet
and know all the spells.

29:13.001 --> 29:15.754
And I know what makes Amara tick.

29:15.963 --> 29:18.557
And I had a relationship
with the Big Guy for eons.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.430
Shall I keep going?

29:20.634 --> 29:21.977
Hey, that's mine!

29:25.180 --> 29:29.105
As much as I hate to admit this,
he kind of has a point.

29:29.309 --> 29:31.061
I don't know.

29:31.436 --> 29:34.815
You need all the help you can get,
even "douche" help.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.948
And since when did you jump
on the God-wagon?

29:38.151 --> 29:39.351
You never used to give a damn.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.738
I didn't. At one time.

29:43.198 --> 29:46.623
Now he's gone all kamikaze,
leaving us with The Darkness.

29:51.290 --> 29:55.045
I was by his side since the Creation.

29:55.919 --> 29:57.216
He believed in me.

29:57.879 --> 30:02.931
If there's something I can do
to help save him, and his Creation then...

30:05.929 --> 30:07.977
Seems like I should.

30:13.228 --> 30:16.357
The plan is to rescue Lucifer from Amara.

30:16.565 --> 30:19.614
Then he teleports us
out of Amara's hideout,

30:20.068 --> 30:23.743
and we convince Chuck
to use him to fight her.

30:28.702 --> 30:29.874
That's your plan?

30:30.704 --> 30:32.832
Do you even know where Amara is?

30:33.373 --> 30:35.296
I think I might know where she is.

30:35.959 --> 30:40.385
I've been getting this vibe.
It's like a ping in my cerebral cortex.

30:41.757 --> 30:44.260
Oh, so either Amara or a stroke.

30:44.926 --> 30:49.602
And how are we supposed to keep Amara busy
while we're liberating Lucifer?

31:17.626 --> 31:19.628
Thank you for reaching out to me, Dean.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.258
You said you wanted to meet.

31:24.925 --> 31:26.427
I missed you.

31:27.844 --> 31:32.145
And the sensations you arouse.

31:33.350 --> 31:38.026
I know you feel the same way,
so what do we do?

31:40.357 --> 31:41.529
There can be no "us."

31:45.612 --> 31:47.364
We should just walk away.

31:49.825 --> 31:51.452
Then why don't you?

32:35.328 --> 32:36.545
Oh, goody.

32:38.039 --> 32:41.760
Larry, Curly, Moe.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.468
Search and rescue?

32:48.049 --> 32:51.724
Oh, wow, it's one of Dad's favorites.

32:52.679 --> 32:54.773
Your ticket finally got punched, huh?

32:55.432 --> 32:56.433
It's wacky, isn't it?

32:56.600 --> 33:02.698
One minute, you're nobody,
and then shazam, you're Joan of Arc.

33:03.440 --> 33:04.532
Let's, uh...

33:05.066 --> 33:06.986
Let's hope this ends better than that.

33:07.027 --> 33:10.076
All right, can the small talk.
We're busting you out of here.

33:12.532 --> 33:14.205
Well, seems fair,

33:14.409 --> 33:18.915
since I wouldn't be here if you lunatics
hadn't set me up to be grabbed by Amara.

33:19.289 --> 33:21.041
You're gonna help us take her down.

33:21.666 --> 33:24.215
If you say no,
we'll just leave you here in Abu Ghraib.

33:27.464 --> 33:29.967
Say no?

33:30.175 --> 33:34.476
You see what she's done to me?
Do I look like a fan?

33:36.056 --> 33:41.404
This place, this world,
hasn't been especially easy for you.

33:42.938 --> 33:46.283
Why not at least consider my offer?

33:48.276 --> 33:50.404
This world is flawed, I'll give you that.

33:51.738 --> 33:53.991
But I am not ready
to say good-bye to it just yet.

33:54.199 --> 33:56.577
But one way or the other, you will.

33:57.244 --> 33:58.621
It's inevitable.

33:59.412 --> 34:01.756
My brother won 't stop me again,

34:03.667 --> 34:05.260
because he can't.

34:06.795 --> 34:10.800
Dean, give up your smallness,

34:12.467 --> 34:13.514
your humanity,

34:13.717 --> 34:18.063
and become boundless within me.

34:22.310 --> 34:24.233
Did you grab this from the steno pool?

34:24.437 --> 34:26.610
You understand
you'll be working with your father.

34:27.607 --> 34:29.449
Is that gonna be a problem?

34:30.277 --> 34:33.621
That's family. This is bigger.

34:33.862 --> 34:35.331
So you'll table all the old stuff.

34:36.283 --> 34:38.377
What happens in Heaven stays in Heaven.

34:41.121 --> 34:44.000
Metatron, are we getting any closer?
Dean can't stall forever.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.217
I'm narrowing it down!

34:48.460 --> 34:51.054
You're right. I am drawn to you.

34:52.799 --> 34:56.929
And it bothers the hell out of me,
'cause I can't control it.

34:57.137 --> 34:58.810
Then why fight it?

35:00.974 --> 35:05.730
What you're feeling is that
I am the end of your struggle.

35:08.356 --> 35:10.450
Something stops you,

35:13.236 --> 35:15.455
keeps you from having it all.

35:28.001 --> 35:29.503
Yes.

35:31.046 --> 35:32.468
Where are your thoughts?

35:38.887 --> 35:40.184
Somethings different.

35:40.388 --> 35:42.436
Hey, Lucifer, zap us out of here. Quick.

35:43.475 --> 35:44.476
No can do.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.065
What do you mean you can't do it?

35:46.561 --> 35:50.156
Temporarily grounded.
Equipment malfunction.

35:51.775 --> 35:53.823
You've spoken with God.

35:56.237 --> 35:58.239
You've seen him.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.418
You betrayed me.

36:04.245 --> 36:09.001
Guys, I'm feeling her. She's coming.

36:10.460 --> 36:11.620
All right, we're out of here.

36:16.341 --> 36:18.014
All right, Metatron, come on.

36:18.259 --> 36:19.431
It's okay, Sam. You go.

36:20.095 --> 36:21.142
What? Come on!

36:22.430 --> 36:23.682
I'm serious.

36:26.184 --> 36:27.276
I got this.

36:58.174 --> 36:59.471
The secretary.

37:18.319 --> 37:19.992
You were kidding with that, weren't you?

37:21.823 --> 37:22.995
He meant well.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.003
Spare the universe.

37:29.581 --> 37:30.833
Spare this.

38:02.071 --> 38:03.197
Your move.

38:17.212 --> 38:19.385
You really aren't worth sparing.

38:21.466 --> 38:22.638
None of you.

38:36.064 --> 38:37.907
What happened?

38:57.752 --> 38:59.254
Where are we?

39:02.465 --> 39:03.591
Home.

39:09.264 --> 39:11.687
Occasionally, I do answer a prayer.

39:24.821 --> 39:25.868
You've changed.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.620
You've changed.

39:32.829 --> 39:35.833
Well, still.
I'm really pretty much the same.

40:00.565 --> 40:01.908
Still twitchy, huh?

40:02.150 --> 40:05.154
Now you've met God,
Lucifer and The Darkness.

40:05.320 --> 40:06.572
You're gonna need a spa day.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.330
That or a pair of hookers.

40:11.659 --> 40:13.299
Ah, I have to sort it all out.

40:13.661 --> 40:15.755
Uh, see what comes next.

40:15.997 --> 40:18.420
I don't feel much like
returning to academia.

40:18.666 --> 40:20.947
And, uh, I sure as hell can't go back
to being an atheist.

40:21.169 --> 40:22.341
Yeah, I hear you.

40:23.880 --> 40:26.679
- Thank you, I guess.
- Yeah.

40:27.675 --> 40:28.722
And, uh...

40:29.844 --> 40:33.519
And if there is a tomorrow,
given your line of work,

40:33.723 --> 40:35.350
I'll probably see you again.

40:36.851 --> 40:38.524
Stay tuned. We may need you.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.912
- So Metatron took one for the team.
- Yeah.

40:48.112 --> 40:49.739
I wouldn't have called that.

40:52.575 --> 40:54.373
So, you wanna tell me about it?

40:55.286 --> 40:57.254
I mean, Amara obviously figured out
something was going on

40:57.455 --> 40:58.877
and she didn't rip your head off.

41:00.583 --> 41:02.210
She wants me to be a part of her.

41:03.127 --> 41:05.221
Not metaphorically, I'm talking literally.

41:05.797 --> 41:06.889
Forever.

41:10.635 --> 41:13.730
So, in other words, adiés.

41:57.557 --> 41:58.558
ENGLISH - SDH
