00:19.353 --> 00:20.786
What are you trying

00:20.788 --> 00:24.023
She wants us to only

Why do you get to stay Maya

00:43.878 --> 00:45.577
Because Maya's
an actual Spanish name.

00:45.579 --> 00:46.812
Well, then, what's Riley?

00:46.814 --> 00:48.480

02:19.240 --> 02:22.441
I don't deserve to sit
with you guys. I am disgraced.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.343
"D" for disgraced.

02:24.345 --> 02:26.178
Riley, it's only one grade.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.080
Yeah, you know how many "D's"
I got in middle school?

02:28.082 --> 02:29.648
Once, I got five "D's"
in one day.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.251
You were Cinco D Maya.

02:32.253 --> 02:35.954
I don't get it.

02:35.956 --> 02:37.923
Actually, those "D's"
don't matter anymore, Maya.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.091
None of our old grades do.

02:39.093 --> 02:40.125
We all start as equals here,

02:40.127 --> 02:41.660
because only our high school
grades count on our

02:41.662 --> 02:42.828
permanent record.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.796
What? What's that?

02:44.798 --> 02:46.165
It's our high school transcript.

02:46.167 --> 02:47.199
It's what colleges use

02:47.201 --> 02:48.634
when they decide whether
to accept you or not.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.435
And so far for you, not.

02:50.437 --> 02:51.937
Hm... Smackle, remember how

02:51.939 --> 02:53.205
you asked us to let you know

02:53.207 --> 02:55.507
when your refreshing honesty
crosses over into--

02:55.509 --> 02:56.642
Get to it, Bubbles!

02:56.644 --> 02:58.477
Now!

02:58.479 --> 03:00.712
Wait, so they don't care
about middle school?

03:00.714 --> 03:02.214
They only look
at your high school grades.

03:02.216 --> 03:04.449
Then why'd you make me
go all this time?

03:06.854 --> 03:09.188
Wait. So nobody cares about
all the good grades I got

03:09.190 --> 03:10.455
when I was a kid?

03:10.457 --> 03:12.357
They only care
that you didn't eat paste.

03:12.359 --> 03:15.127
Oh. How long does that
stay in ya?

03:16.497 --> 03:18.397
Boy, all those years
I went to middle school

03:18.399 --> 03:20.899
I could've been
scratchin' lottery tickets
and chuggin' sody pop.

03:20.901 --> 03:23.135
Well, Maya, you finally
hit the jackpot.

03:23.137 --> 03:24.970
I mean, right now, you can go
to any college you want.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.371
What about me?

03:26.373 --> 03:28.307
You're her cute friend.

03:28.309 --> 03:31.376
Please don't
give up on me, college.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.478
Colleges don't only
care about grades, you know.

03:33.480 --> 03:34.846
They care
about extracurriculars.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.648
And that's why Zay and I
are trying out for baseball.

03:36.650 --> 03:37.849
Since the football team

03:37.851 --> 03:39.318
made their feelings about us
quite clear.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.419
It wasn't that bad.

03:40.421 --> 03:41.553
It was!

03:42.423 --> 03:44.089
They hit us so hard.

03:44.091 --> 03:46.024
It's all right,
baseball's our sport anyway.

03:46.026 --> 03:48.560
Yeah. Lucas was our star
in middle school.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.761
What were you?

03:49.763 --> 03:51.496
I was his cute friend.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.501
I never got a "D" before.

03:56.503 --> 03:58.270
I used to be the biggest star
in middle school.

03:58.272 --> 04:00.172
You're still a star,
dearest one.

04:00.174 --> 04:01.506
Yeah, but I used to be
the North Star.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.542
I used to be
the brightest star in the sky.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.577
What do you do when you realize
you're not the smartest kid
in school anymore?

04:05.579 --> 04:08.113
I don't know.
Maya, what do you do
when you realize

04:08.115 --> 04:09.681
your best days might have been
in middle school?

04:09.683 --> 04:14.186
I don't know.
Why don't we ask
my big, fat, honkin' "A"?

04:14.188 --> 04:16.455
What do you do, "A"?

04:16.457 --> 04:19.458
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.193
-What'd it say? What'd it say?
-I know, right?

04:21.195 --> 04:22.461
Shhh.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.730
Maya and "A" don't get to spend
a lot of time together.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.298
Let's let them
have their moment.

04:26.300 --> 04:32.104
Oh, I don't know.
Anywhere in the world
as long as it's with you.

04:32.106 --> 04:35.674
Yeah, she's great.
She doesn't
get good grades, though.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.654
No, you hang up.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.992
No, you hang up.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.827
You're still there.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.796
Oh, "A".

05:02.336 --> 05:05.470
Hey, you gonna do that thing
where you say "How was school?"

05:05.472 --> 05:08.073
'cause you do it every day,
and you haven't done it yet
today, why is that?

05:08.075 --> 05:09.474
Why?

05:09.476 --> 05:11.576
Today, we learned
the cursive letter "D".

05:11.578 --> 05:12.678
There's one, now.

05:15.249 --> 05:18.617
What'sa matter, Riley?
You're doing that thing
I did every day after school.

05:18.619 --> 05:19.918
Except I also
used to add a little--

05:19.920 --> 05:21.486
-(Riley squeaks)
-Yeah, that's it.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.855
I must've been at this table
a thousand times,

05:23.857 --> 05:25.524
and a thousand times
you ask, "How was school?"

05:25.526 --> 05:27.859
but you haven't done it
yet today, why is that? Why?

05:27.861 --> 05:29.328
How was school?

05:29.330 --> 05:31.630
Welcome, to the first ever
in her life

05:31.632 --> 05:34.299
Maya
refrigerator ceremony!

05:34.301 --> 05:35.600
Maya!

05:35.602 --> 05:38.003
How you do that, Maya?

05:38.005 --> 05:39.805
I did it myself
with my own widdle head.

05:39.807 --> 05:40.839
No cheatie?

05:40.841 --> 05:41.940
All brainie.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.475
Cory and Auggie:
Yayyy!

05:43.477 --> 05:44.609
That's an "A"!

05:44.611 --> 05:46.445
Lemme smell that!

05:46.447 --> 05:48.480
That's real, baby!

05:48.482 --> 05:52.551
(Topanga and Maya sing
celebration song)

05:52.553 --> 05:55.654
I would never want this
to change how you feel
about your real children.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.389
Oh... how could it?

06:00.494 --> 06:03.729
That's not gonna hurt
how I grow up at all.

06:03.731 --> 06:07.499
Wait a minute.
I smell somethin' else, too.
And it ain't good.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.634
(sniffs) What smells, super spy?

06:09.636 --> 06:11.737
Dun, dun, dun!

06:13.073 --> 06:16.208
Riley... it's only one grade.

06:18.212 --> 06:22.180
You know what Farkle said?
Farkle said that we get
one bad grade in high school

06:22.182 --> 06:25.250
it'd affect me getting
into a good college,
but that's nutty, right?

06:25.252 --> 06:27.252
Somebody tell me
that that's nutty.

06:27.254 --> 06:29.254
Cory, will you please
straighten her out?

06:29.256 --> 06:31.823
I'm braiding
my new daughter's hair.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.692
I'm sorry, Riley,
but it's true.

06:33.694 --> 06:36.928
Everything that you do
in high school affects
what college you get into.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.730
Can I get into college
with this?

06:38.732 --> 06:39.998
Of course!

06:40.000 --> 06:41.233
-Columbia?
-No!

06:41.235 --> 06:42.401
-Rutgers?
-No!

06:42.403 --> 06:44.469
-Which college?
-Ed's Learnin' Hole.

06:45.606 --> 06:48.440
-Really?
-No!

06:48.442 --> 06:49.875
I am donezo.

06:49.877 --> 06:54.079
No, Riley, you're not donezo.
That's just one grade
on one test.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.014
And you can bring it up,
but if you don't,
you should know

06:56.016 --> 06:58.750
that a bad final grade
on your transcript
could alter your future.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.285
Then what are we going to do?

07:00.287 --> 07:01.920
Riley, you've always
been a good student.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.356
You go to school,
I'll talk to your teacher.

07:04.358 --> 07:06.057
Cory, do you really think
you're the best person to--

07:06.059 --> 07:08.460
Cory and Topanga:
Yes! I am the best person
there is!

07:09.897 --> 07:13.799
Topanga, I'm a teacher,
she's a teacher,
we're<i> simpatico!</i>

07:13.801 --> 07:15.233
That means "like each other."

07:15.235 --> 07:16.468
You've changed.

07:16.470 --> 07:19.104
Riles, I live
in a Spanish-speaking community,

07:19.106 --> 07:20.705
I've heard it out my window
all these years,

07:20.707 --> 07:21.706
so I've picked some up.

07:21.708 --> 07:23.575
Honey, you just need
to study more.

07:23.577 --> 07:24.709
You're gonna
pick your grade up.

07:24.711 --> 07:26.812
And then I'll be
your daughter again.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.613
Let's just see
how it goes.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.423
-(knocking)
-Hi, there!

07:38.425 --> 07:39.591
Spanish only.

07:39.593 --> 07:40.992
<i>Hola</i> there!

07:40.994 --> 07:43.829
I'm kidding,
that's just for the students,
Señor Matthews.

07:43.831 --> 07:46.164
Good, because after hi,
how are you and what time is it,

07:46.166 --> 07:47.966
I was gonna have to<i> vamanos.</i>

07:47.968 --> 07:50.669
Actually, that means
that we're both leaving.

07:51.738 --> 07:53.622
But what can I do for you?

07:53.623 --> 07:55.507
So I'm actually here
because I wanted to talk
to you about--

07:55.509 --> 07:58.143
Your daughter.
I hope you're not here
trying to get me

07:58.145 --> 07:59.644
to change her grade.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.447
I'm here because,
although I'm a new teacher
at this school,

08:02.449 --> 08:04.649
I know a good student
when I see one.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.618
You know what I've always
found interesting

08:06.620 --> 08:08.353
about teaching
the freshman class is that,

08:08.355 --> 08:11.656
you also have to prepare them
for their next three years.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.292
Well, how are you
preparing her by giving her
a "D" on her first test?

08:14.294 --> 08:16.695
I mean, to me
that's only preparing her
to believe

08:16.697 --> 08:18.330
she's a "D" student
in your class.

08:18.332 --> 08:19.865
-She is.
-I'm sorry?

08:19.867 --> 08:22.133
On her first test
she earned a "D".

08:22.135 --> 08:24.769
I need you to say
somethin' else.

08:24.771 --> 08:26.805
Okay, here's something else.

08:26.807 --> 08:29.174
The next three years
only gets harder,

08:29.176 --> 08:31.009
and what comes after that
is ridiculous.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.144
Right. So why not
build their self-confidence?

08:33.146 --> 08:34.646
Because if we're good teachers,

08:34.648 --> 08:36.815
we can get them
to do that themselves.

08:36.817 --> 08:43.889
Well, yeah... I...
I have the tremendous
disadvantage of loving her.

08:46.994 --> 08:49.227
I love 'em all.

08:49.229 --> 08:52.030
Welcome to high school,
Mr. Matthews.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.833
I need you to understand
that I know what I'm doing.

08:54.835 --> 08:56.835
Would you do me a favor
and please just consider

08:56.837 --> 08:58.570
-that the test--
-Was too hard.

08:58.572 --> 09:00.705
Yeah, I hear it every year.

09:00.707 --> 09:05.377
Would you do me a favor
and consider that I know
what I'm doing?

09:05.379 --> 09:06.978
Yeah, I'll consider it.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.249
Not here.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.652
Okay, so long
as you consider
that they've been

09:13.654 --> 09:15.520
very good students
up till now.

09:15.522 --> 09:18.023
And it's up to us
to keep that going,
isn't it?

09:18.025 --> 09:21.726
-It's harder here.
-In any language.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.936
It was that bad?

09:30.938 --> 09:33.104
Riley...

09:34.207 --> 09:36.775
Do you see all these students?

09:36.777 --> 09:38.276
Yeah.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.778
Do you know any of 'em?

09:41.114 --> 09:42.280
Not yet.

09:42.282 --> 09:45.317
Your Spanish teacher
doesn't know you either, yet.

09:46.853 --> 09:47.919
We're new here, Riley.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.956
We need to show 'em
who we are.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.935
<i>-Trabajar.</i>
-To work.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.637
<i>Muy bien.</i> Now conjugate!

10:05.639 --> 10:07.939
<i>Trabajo, trabajas, trabaja--</i>

10:07.941 --> 10:09.708
<i>Excellente, mija!</i>

10:09.710 --> 10:13.278
-Chewbacca, Chewbakaka...
-What is wrong with you?

10:13.280 --> 10:15.246
Please remember me
when you get to college.

10:15.248 --> 10:16.982
-I'm you!
-You're me?

10:16.984 --> 10:20.318
Yeah! All of a sudden
I'm a loser!

10:20.320 --> 10:22.120
-I'm you!
-You're me?

10:22.122 --> 10:24.723
Yeah! All of sudden
I'm a phenom!

10:28.929 --> 10:30.829
Both:
Aahhhh!

10:30.831 --> 10:33.264
Okay... when did you guys
come up with that?

10:33.266 --> 10:36.601
Oh, it's just something
people on this side of the room
know about.

10:36.603 --> 10:40.238
Okay... well, we actually
know about it, too.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.580
Okay... okay, okay, okay.

10:48.582 --> 10:51.149
We had our first baseball
tryout today. All my life,

10:51.151 --> 10:52.684
baseball has always
come easy to me.

10:52.686 --> 10:53.818
Not today.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.987
It's gone.
I mean, I get up to bat

10:55.989 --> 10:57.288
and I can't even see the ball.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.124
Meanwhile, back on this side
of the room...

10:59.126 --> 11:02.427
He can't miss.
He's hitting everything,
he's great in the field,

11:02.429 --> 11:03.795
he's an all-star.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.864
Wait, Lucas, tell 'em
what the coach said
about me, tell 'em.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.699
He said, "Good day, kid."

11:07.701 --> 11:08.967
Now tell 'em
what he said about you.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.969
He said, "Good day, kid."

11:10.971 --> 11:13.505
Riley, we're losers.

11:13.507 --> 11:15.140
Do you know what's on
our permanent record?

11:15.142 --> 11:18.009
Glitter and smiley faces
if we try try again?

11:18.011 --> 11:19.344
Losers!

11:21.281 --> 11:22.947
What's the matter, darling?

11:22.949 --> 11:24.616
There's another genius
in my Honors Chem class!

11:24.618 --> 11:26.117
The other genius
is making me feel bad!

11:26.119 --> 11:30.021
Then you're on this side
of the room, loser.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.390
You know what the worst thing
of life is?

11:32.392 --> 11:34.659
The worst thing of life
is when someone you know
is better than you

11:34.661 --> 11:35.960
-in every way--
-Rubs it in your face?

11:35.962 --> 11:38.029
-No.
-Can't hit a baseball
to save his life?

11:38.031 --> 11:40.699
-Me time!
-I was talking about you.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.034
The worst thing of life
is when someone you know
is better than you

11:43.036 --> 11:44.469
in every way
loves you anyway.

11:44.471 --> 11:45.704
Honeybuckets!

11:45.706 --> 11:48.640
Smackle's the genius
in your chemistry class?

11:48.642 --> 11:50.408
Smackle's the genius everywhere.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.143
Well, you're with us now.

11:52.145 --> 11:53.845
Don't hit on me
in front of Lucas.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.046
Smackle...

11:55.048 --> 11:56.314
Don't hit on me
in front of Farkle.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.750
-Smackle...
-You, me, Lucas and Zay.

11:58.752 --> 12:01.386
We're better than a triangle,
we're a quadrilateral!

12:01.388 --> 12:03.021
What's that?

12:03.023 --> 12:06.458
It means square.
Over here we say square.

12:07.994 --> 12:11.262
Oh, beloved... you know
how smart you are,
don't feel threatened.

12:11.264 --> 12:14.566
I don't feel threatened,
my former arch nemesis
and current arch lovesis.

12:14.568 --> 12:17.769
I just feel confused.
I've never been on this side
of the room before.

12:17.771 --> 12:20.105
Yeah, I'm not thrilled
about it, either.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.339
How do you feel?

12:21.341 --> 12:24.375
Well, I am happy for you guys.

12:24.377 --> 12:27.045
Of course you are.
You're Riley.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.747
You've always been Riley.

12:35.388 --> 12:38.089
Riley, have you been
up all night?

12:38.091 --> 12:39.224
It's morning?

12:39.226 --> 12:41.126
Yes, honey,
did you learn anything?

12:41.128 --> 12:45.530
Well, I did learn
how to conjugate
the Spanish verb "Chewbacca."

12:45.532 --> 12:51.236
-How?
-(makes Chewbacca noise)

12:51.238 --> 12:53.071
very good, honey.

12:53.073 --> 12:55.540
Wait, where are you going?

12:55.542 --> 12:57.542
Oh, I think you know
where I'm going.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.210
Get her, Mommy!

13:05.819 --> 13:08.119
-Hi.
-Spanish only.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.988
Not doin' it.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.756
You're Señora Matthews.

13:11.758 --> 13:13.958
-I am.
-You're here to tell me
Riley's a good student.

13:13.960 --> 13:14.993
I think you know that.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.661
You're here to tell me
the test was too hard.

13:16.663 --> 13:17.996
I think you know that, too.

13:17.998 --> 13:20.098
So, why are you here?

13:20.100 --> 13:21.966
I'm here to thank you.

13:21.968 --> 13:24.936
-For what?
-We love our children.

13:24.938 --> 13:28.940
We want them at their best.
But sometimes we need help
pushing them there.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.508
We don't want to push too hard.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.745
-You a good teacher?
-I am.

13:33.747 --> 13:35.780
-You have children?
-I do.

13:35.782 --> 13:38.616
And when they're in high school
and in your husband's class,

13:38.618 --> 13:40.451
and he pushes them
to be at their best,

13:40.453 --> 13:42.353
I'll come in and tell him
to back off a little.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.023
But he won't.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.125
Because I can tell
he's a good teacher, too.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.027
Yeah. He is.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.129
They'll be in good hands.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.597
Just like my little girl.

13:52.599 --> 13:56.167
<i>-Gracias.</i>
<i>-De nada.</i>

14:07.013 --> 14:09.948
I saw her.
She was in early
because she's a good teacher.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.182
Morning!

14:13.653 --> 14:15.119
Did you fix it, Mommy?

14:15.121 --> 14:17.188
I tried.
And so did your father.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.024
But as much as we'd like it to,
this isn't something that can
come from us.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.227
So, that's it,
I really am donezo?

14:22.229 --> 14:24.062
No, Riley, we would never
let anybody--

14:24.064 --> 14:25.163
Cory?

14:25.165 --> 14:26.631
She wants to talk to me!

14:26.633 --> 14:29.567
I'm gonna get killed!

14:29.569 --> 14:31.035
Yes?

14:31.037 --> 14:33.004
You know how sometimes
you think like her father,

14:33.006 --> 14:34.472
and sometimes
you think like her teacher?

14:34.474 --> 14:36.207
Yes, and right now
I'm thinking like her father.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.743
I feel bad for her,
because I know
she's a good student,

14:38.745 --> 14:40.044
and I know she wants to do well.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.646
Now think like her teacher.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.581
She's a good student.

14:43.583 --> 14:47.252
Everybody knows that.
The Spanish teacher
knows it, too.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.723
She needs to step her game.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.524
-They all do.
-Mm-hmm.

14:53.526 --> 14:54.926
Good isn't good enough anymore.

14:54.928 --> 14:55.994
That's a good thing.

14:55.996 --> 14:58.229
-Good.
-Too many goods.

15:02.269 --> 15:03.534
Riley.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.336
Yeah, Dad?

15:05.338 --> 15:08.339
We've always taught you
that life presents challenges.

15:08.341 --> 15:09.908
That's what life is.

15:09.910 --> 15:12.777
You got a "D"
on your Spanish exam.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.245
What are you gonna
do about it?

15:15.282 --> 15:17.215
You're putting this on me?

15:17.217 --> 15:20.151
Yeah. I am.
I gotta go to school.

15:21.421 --> 15:25.223
But, before I leave
to be your teacher...

15:25.225 --> 15:26.858
go get 'em!

15:28.295 --> 15:30.094
Auggie, how's second grade?

15:30.096 --> 15:32.196
Second grade's ridiculous!

15:33.733 --> 15:37.735
They took the whole nap thing
away, they switched from cookies
to carrots,

15:37.737 --> 15:42.707
learn science, learn math.
Where's my cake,
ya monsters?

15:42.709 --> 15:48.446
Honey... you just have
to try harder so that
you're ready for third grade.

15:48.448 --> 15:52.116
This is all
for her benefit, isn't it?

15:52.118 --> 15:55.687
Yeah! See how smart
you're getting already!

15:58.224 --> 15:59.891
You hear that, Riles?

15:59.893 --> 16:02.060
-What?
-Listen, listen...

16:02.062 --> 16:06.264
Uh-huh? Yeah, yeah,
I'll tell her. Uh-huh.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.800
Wait! What'd it say?

16:08.802 --> 16:12.971
It just said, it wants me
to tell you that it misses you.

16:23.616 --> 16:26.217
-It does!
-Mm-hmm.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.359
Señora Feinstein-Chang?

16:34.361 --> 16:37.195
-Riley?
-Oh, you know my name name.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.697
I'm gonna tell you
something in English now.

16:39.699 --> 16:43.434
-Why?
-Because it's really important
that you understand this.

16:43.436 --> 16:46.204
You're about to ask me
if you can have a make-up test,

16:46.206 --> 16:49.340
or an extra credit assignment
to raise your grade on the test

16:49.342 --> 16:51.809
because you've never gotten
a "D" before, and it'll never
ever happen again,

16:51.811 --> 16:54.212
because this is high school now,
and everything matters.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.114
Now you're speaking my language.

16:56.116 --> 16:59.050
Good! And now
that we've communicated clearly,

16:59.052 --> 17:00.985
I want to tell you
that there will be
no make-up test

17:00.987 --> 17:02.320
or extra credit assignments.

17:02.322 --> 17:05.490
So, the "D" is actually
on my permanent record,

17:05.492 --> 17:07.225
and there is nothing
I can do about it?

17:07.227 --> 17:09.494
The "D" is one grade
on a weekly test.

17:09.496 --> 17:12.230
And that test tells me
what you know this week.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.998
You know what test
is more important to me?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.666
The test next week.

17:15.668 --> 17:17.468
That's always
the most important test.

17:17.470 --> 17:21.305
Because that's the one
that helps me determine
your final grade.

17:21.307 --> 17:24.308
Because that tells me
which direction you want to go.

17:24.310 --> 17:27.378
You want to know how to find out
which direction you want to go?

17:27.380 --> 17:29.080
How?

17:29.082 --> 17:31.682
Check your permanent record.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.618
You've always had one, you know.

17:58.945 --> 18:00.812
What are you gonna do
about Smackle?

18:02.182 --> 18:04.449
I got a real problem here.

18:06.519 --> 18:07.952
I could raise my level.

18:07.954 --> 18:10.354
But I know if I do,
it'll only make her
raise her level, too.

18:10.356 --> 18:13.124
But, then you'd both
be better off for it?

18:13.126 --> 18:17.195
Yeah... what good is life
unless it throws
a Smackle in your face?

18:19.933 --> 18:24.235
Farkle... I don't think
our permanent record
begins in high school.

18:24.237 --> 18:26.471
It has to matter
what grades we got
in middle school.

18:26.473 --> 18:29.540
It has to matter
that who we were
affects who we are.

18:30.977 --> 18:34.645
You chose Smackle
because you want to raise
your level.

18:34.647 --> 18:35.880
That's who you are.

18:35.882 --> 18:38.716
What are you gonna do
about Spanish class?

18:42.055 --> 18:44.989
I'm going
to have to raise
my level, too.

18:44.991 --> 18:48.326
I was always
a pretty good student.

18:48.328 --> 18:51.329
You were always
the smartest student
in the class.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.433
That's not good enough.

18:55.435 --> 18:56.834
I knew you'd say that.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.102
Why?

18:58.104 --> 19:00.104
Because you've always
been Riley.

19:00.106 --> 19:01.739
That's your permanent record.

19:19.292 --> 19:22.059
<i>Buenas noches,</i> Spanish book.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.364
<i>Me llamo Roberta.</i>

19:34.340 --> 19:37.608
<i>Buenos días,</i>
<i>Señora Feinstein-Chang.</i>

19:37.610 --> 19:39.710
<i>Hoy es un nuevo día.</i>

19:39.712 --> 19:41.846
<i>Español. Muy bien, Roberta.</i>

19:41.848 --> 19:44.382
<i>Gracias por empujarme a elevar</i>

19:44.384 --> 19:47.451
<i>mi aguacate.</i>

19:47.453 --> 19:51.155
<i>Voy a mejorar mi aguacate</i>
<i>a la letra "D"</i>

19:51.157 --> 19:54.392
<i>a la letra "A". Gracias.</i>

19:54.394 --> 19:57.428
<i>La papa es un buen barco</i>
<i>de vela.</i>

19:58.965 --> 20:00.698
<i>Esa es mi chica, Roberta.</i>

20:00.700 --> 20:02.533
<i>La papa es un buen barco</i>
<i>de vela.</i>

20:02.535 --> 20:04.101
Sit down.

20:06.139 --> 20:08.706
Very good, Riley.
I expected nothing less.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.409
<i>Español solamente, por favor.</i>

20:11.411 --> 20:13.144
<i>Si, señorita.</i>

20:20.220 --> 20:21.986
You guys are early for class.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.922
I want an "A" from you, too,
Matthews, I'm collecting
a whole set.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.524
Good for you, Maya.

20:26.526 --> 20:29.860
Eh, quit your blubberin',
this'll go away.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.696
I had such a good day
at tryouts,

20:31.698 --> 20:33.431
I thought the coach
was gonna put me on varsity.

20:33.433 --> 20:36.067
I didn't even deserve
to make junior varsity
the way I practiced.

20:36.069 --> 20:38.502
But he put us both
on the J.V. team.

20:38.504 --> 20:42.440
You know what I've known
all along, even though
I learned it just now?

20:42.442 --> 20:46.677
Good teachers look down the road
to someone's possibilities.

20:46.679 --> 20:49.680
What you know now
is never good enough

20:49.682 --> 20:51.082
for a good teacher.

20:51.084 --> 20:54.085
Because there's so much
out there to learn.

20:54.087 --> 20:57.622
And sometimes you won't
get it at all.

20:57.624 --> 21:02.560
And sometimes it may seem
like we're speaking to you
in a foreign language.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.762
But you know what?

21:04.764 --> 21:07.798
There are good teachers here.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.468
I'm looking forward
to being one of them.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.770
You always have been.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.439
You know, I'm glad
we get to play together
on the same team.

21:15.441 --> 21:18.309
Me, too, man.

21:18.311 --> 21:21.612
I am excited we are partaking
in this intellectual endeavor
together, dearest.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.748
As am I. Even though
I must finally admit

21:23.750 --> 21:26.117
I am beginning
to think you are
my intellectual superior.

21:26.119 --> 21:29.487
I used to think so,
but now I regard us
as equals.

21:29.489 --> 21:31.756
Maya/Riley/Lucas/Zay:
Awwww!

21:31.758 --> 21:33.457
Good. Then you're not
as smart as I thought.

21:34.994 --> 21:37.361
Awww!

21:38.731 --> 21:41.966
I hate when that happens.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.237
High school?

21:46.239 --> 21:48.839
"A minus"
on my latest Spanish test.

21:48.841 --> 21:50.841
Nice work, Roberta!

21:50.843 --> 21:54.612
<i>La papa es un buen barco</i>
<i>de vela.</i>

21:54.614 --> 21:56.213
Okay!

21:57.183 --> 21:58.816
How's second grade treatin' ya?

21:58.818 --> 22:00.618
Second grade's hard.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.920
It is, Bubba.
But you'll get the hang of it.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.288
I know who you are.

22:04.290 --> 22:06.490
Good. Because...

22:06.492 --> 22:07.992
Gold star!

22:07.994 --> 22:09.927
Riley/Maya/Cory/Topanga:
Yay!

22:09.929 --> 22:11.195
Fridge me!

22:11.197 --> 22:14.565
(singing celebration song)

22:15.635 --> 22:16.901
There's room next to mine.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.304
Well, pressure's off.

22:20.306 --> 22:22.440
No, no, no, you'll be back.

22:22.442 --> 22:26.677
Yeah. Stupid 'frigerator
makes me wanna do a better job.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.613
Good. Because I need
your help in Spanish.

22:29.615 --> 22:32.717
Good. Because I need
your help in everything else.
