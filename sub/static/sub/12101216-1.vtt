01:12.982 --> 01:16.618
- She's all yours.
- What?

01:19.788 --> 01:22.024
Shaun.

01:29.764 --> 01:32.867
Relax, babe.
You're not going anywhere.

02:28.257 --> 02:30.092
What brings you
out this way?

02:31.826 --> 02:33.195
Just a weekend trip.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.098
By yourself?

02:39.801 --> 02:41.703
My husband's coming tomorrow.

02:43.671 --> 02:46.674
- You're married?
- Yeah.

02:50.379 --> 02:53.149
He's not worried about you
being out here all alone?

02:56.718 --> 02:59.055
Sorry, didn't mean to pry.

03:02.091 --> 03:03.059
It's fine.

04:11.961 --> 04:14.964
You can leave them there.

04:25.274 --> 04:27.742
Um... nice to meet you,
Mrs. um...

04:29.545 --> 04:31.347
- Barrett
- Joe.

04:32.014 --> 04:34.649
- It's Joe.
- Joe. Thank you, Joe.

04:36.152 --> 04:39.255
You know, I come out here
to hunt sometimes.

04:39.955 --> 04:41.756
Never knew this place was
out here.

04:44.393 --> 04:45.660
Kinda out of the way.

04:47.695 --> 04:49.398
Wouldn't mind a little
something extra.

04:52.535 --> 04:53.868
Of course.

05:02.611 --> 05:04.346
There.

05:05.181 --> 05:06.448
Many thanks, Mrs. Barrett.

05:07.416 --> 05:10.119
- Your husband comes tomorrow?
- Yeah.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.687
Good.

05:18.294 --> 05:19.929
You have a good stay,
Mrs. Barrett.

07:59.088 --> 08:00.255
Hmm.

08:31.120 --> 08:34.923
Dammit.

13:04.127 --> 13:05.527
Hey. You're up.

13:06.996 --> 13:08.064
This place is great.

13:08.697 --> 13:10.666
All the security codes
I sent you work?

13:11.067 --> 13:12.834
Yeah. Thanks for texting those.

13:12.969 --> 13:14.202
Yeah.

13:17.606 --> 13:19.708
I thought you couldn't come up
until tomorrow.

13:19.909 --> 13:20.943
Uh, things changed.

13:22.811 --> 13:26.848
This weekend
is very important to me.

13:28.316 --> 13:29.551
Me too.

13:31.186 --> 13:33.522
Can I interest you in some
late-night dessert?

13:40.195 --> 13:41.363
I found another bottle.

13:43.331 --> 13:44.366
How was the drive up?

13:44.733 --> 13:47.869
It was good.
I got a little writing done.

13:48.470 --> 13:51.306
Really?
Anything you can share?

13:52.607 --> 13:55.677
I lost my notebook.
I think I left it in the car.

13:55.811 --> 13:57.546
I told you, you got to start
using your laptop.

13:57.947 --> 14:00.917
Everything's backed up

14:01.184 --> 14:02.384
I know.

14:04.187 --> 14:07.389
Look at this backyard.
We should do this at home.

14:07.789 --> 14:08.824
That'd be nice.

14:13.528 --> 14:15.131
You remember that house
in Monterey?

14:15.697 --> 14:18.366
- How could I forget?
- I think that's my favorite.

14:19.334 --> 14:20.702
That view from the bedroom.

14:21.503 --> 14:23.238
I love being able to hear
the ocean.

14:26.109 --> 14:28.978
That was a great week.
I'll bet we could top it.

14:30.746 --> 14:32.614
After nine years,
I'd like to see you try.

14:32.748 --> 14:35.417
Hey, we better be.

14:35.684 --> 14:37.987
I think years three and five
were my favorite.

14:46.896 --> 14:48.864
It's, um, it's a little cold
out here.

14:49.831 --> 14:52.634
Hmm, I can help you out
with that.

14:52.935 --> 14:56.304
It's just it's a little
chilly for me.

15:02.544 --> 15:05.680
Yeah.

15:40.482 --> 15:43.953
- Henry...
- It's been a long night.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.721
I could use another drink.

15:48.958 --> 15:49.959
Whiskey.

16:01.469 --> 16:02.704
<i>It was perfect.</i>

16:02.838 --> 16:04.106
<i>It could not have gone
any better.</i>

16:04.240 --> 16:05.540
<i>She was so surprised.</i>

16:06.142 --> 16:08.376
Well, congratulations.
She's a sweet girl.

16:09.178 --> 16:10.846
<i>I think Mom
would've really liked her.</i>

16:14.317 --> 16:15.584
Yeah, yeah.

16:15.750 --> 16:16.919
They... they would've
had a lot in common.

16:17.519 --> 16:18.720
<i>She loved the ring by the way.</i>

16:19.021 --> 16:20.589
- Oh, yeah?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

16:20.789 --> 16:22.158
Well, good, good.
She would have

16:22.291 --> 16:23.425
wanted her to have that.

16:23.792 --> 16:25.393
<i>It means a lot to Laura,
you know.</i>

16:26.795 --> 16:28.463
Well, hey,
I'll let you two go

16:28.597 --> 16:30.333
- so you can celebrate.
- <i>Sounds good.</i>

16:30.465 --> 16:32.634
<i>Hey, happy early anniversary.</i>

16:34.436 --> 16:35.871
Yeah, thanks.

16:37.639 --> 16:39.208
I... guess we're on Sunday.

16:40.343 --> 16:43.411
<i>Um, I'm back up at MIT.
I'm leading a new project.</i>

16:44.379 --> 16:46.215
- Well, soon then.
- <i>All right.</i>

16:46.349 --> 16:47.549
<i>Sounds good.</i>

16:47.884 --> 16:49.118
- Okay.
- <i>All right, bye, Dad.</i>

16:49.252 --> 16:50.219
All right, we'll see you.

16:50.552 --> 16:51.586
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Bye.

16:55.390 --> 16:56.658
Laura said yes?

16:58.393 --> 17:00.729
- She did.
- That's great.

17:02.131 --> 17:03.765
They seem like
such a good match.

17:04.901 --> 17:05.834
Yeah.

17:10.872 --> 17:12.975
You must wish that Emily
was here?

17:38.200 --> 17:40.702
Whoa, hey. Hey, you okay?

17:42.104 --> 17:43.872
I just feel dizzy.

17:44.006 --> 17:46.108
Here. Hop in. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:49.711 --> 17:51.846
Okay. Okay.

17:53.149 --> 17:56.718
- The room keeps spinning.
- Come on, you lightweight.

18:05.627 --> 18:06.929
Oh.

18:09.497 --> 18:11.533
- Oh.
- Lightweight.

18:32.554 --> 18:35.757
- Night.
- Night.

20:48.390 --> 20:49.325
Henry...

20:50.792 --> 20:53.362
- Hmm.
- Henry, wake up.

20:55.030 --> 20:58.134
- Emma, I'm exhausted.
- Henry...

21:00.970 --> 21:02.972
when did you get up
this morning?

21:03.805 --> 21:05.241
Honey, I didn't get up.

21:06.741 --> 21:08.344
But... but you made coffee?

21:09.844 --> 21:11.113
No.

21:13.681 --> 21:16.385
Henry... look at me.

21:17.620 --> 21:18.888
Did you put this on me?

21:19.121 --> 21:20.855
Oh! What the hell are you
talking about?

21:20.990 --> 21:23.058
I wasn't wearing this
when I went to bed.

21:24.692 --> 21:26.262
We had a lot to drink
last night.

21:27.630 --> 21:28.964
Yeah, that's really pretty.

21:36.038 --> 21:37.805
This was all here
when I woke up.

21:44.712 --> 21:48.617
"To have and to hold.
For now, and always."

21:49.084 --> 21:53.022
"Happy Anniversary,
Mr. and Mrs. Barrett."

22:01.763 --> 22:03.032
I thought I had a dream
last night,

22:03.199 --> 22:05.568
but I... I think...
I think maybe I was...

22:05.733 --> 22:06.902
I was really awake.

22:07.136 --> 22:08.070
And I... I thought
that I saw something.

22:08.204 --> 22:09.405
What do you think you saw?

22:09.737 --> 22:11.407
It's all kind of hazy,
but I... I think that someone

22:11.540 --> 22:12.675
was in the room.

22:13.409 --> 22:15.010
- Did you lock the doors?
- Yes.

22:15.411 --> 22:17.913
- And you set that alarm?
- I... I... I... I think so.

22:18.047 --> 22:19.648
But I... I didn't hear it
go off.

22:19.781 --> 22:21.050
Okay. Just... just settle down.

22:21.183 --> 22:22.551
- Henry...
- I mean, let's not jump

22:22.685 --> 22:24.186
- to conclusions.
- ...you have to believe me.

22:24.320 --> 22:25.787
- Someone was in here.
- You... you had

22:25.921 --> 22:27.489
- a lot to drink.
- Someone was in here!

22:28.090 --> 22:30.092
And they... they...
they put this nightgown on me,

22:30.226 --> 22:33.429
and if they put me in this,
what else did they do to me?

22:33.596 --> 22:35.331
All right, all right.
Just... just breathe.

22:35.464 --> 22:36.864
Just breathe.

22:39.201 --> 22:40.936
Did you see someone
around here yesterday?

22:41.337 --> 22:42.304
No.

22:42.605 --> 22:44.006
I... I mean, I got the flowers
that you sent.

22:44.139 --> 22:45.140
I... I found them
on the front door.

22:45.274 --> 22:46.874
I didn't send any flowers.

22:49.378 --> 22:50.778
All right, let's call
the property manager.

22:51.746 --> 22:55.117
- Where's your phone?
- It... it was here.

22:56.585 --> 22:58.921
Mine's gone too.

23:01.457 --> 23:02.491
Those aren't my shoes.

23:06.428 --> 23:07.429
These aren't my clothes.

23:10.199 --> 23:12.901
Put something on.
Just grab anything.

23:20.842 --> 23:22.878
Come on. Come on.

23:30.352 --> 23:33.055
- I don't have the keys.
- What do you mean?

23:33.989 --> 23:35.190
Holy shit.

23:36.325 --> 23:38.260
- What do we do?
- I don't have the keys.

23:42.064 --> 23:43.432
There's someone out there.

23:45.734 --> 23:47.036
Get in the house.

23:51.507 --> 23:53.509
Henry, come with me.

23:54.276 --> 23:56.378
Find the keys. Lock that door.

23:57.646 --> 23:59.882
Emma, now!

24:24.707 --> 24:25.840
Oh, God.

24:25.974 --> 24:27.476
<i>Obey us.</i>

25:08.217 --> 25:09.651
Emma!

25:12.121 --> 25:13.922
Emma!

25:17.659 --> 25:20.262
Set the alarm.

25:20.396 --> 25:23.432
- What happened?
- Set the alarm.

25:27.469 --> 25:30.339
- Talk to me.
- Someone jumped me.

25:30.739 --> 25:33.308
- I didn't see who it was.
- Henry, you're bleeding.

25:33.509 --> 25:35.177
I got hit in the back
of the head.

25:35.711 --> 25:36.912
Are you okay?

25:39.047 --> 25:40.315
What the hell is this?

26:01.303 --> 26:03.839
That was on the floor
a minute ago.

26:24.793 --> 26:27.196
<i>You will not leave
the house again.</i>

26:28.697 --> 26:32.601
<i>There are rules.
You must obey us.</i>

26:33.502 --> 26:36.004
<i>Disobedience has consequences.</i>

26:36.138 --> 26:37.372
Us?

26:38.507 --> 26:39.274
Who is this?

26:39.775 --> 26:43.947
<i>Mr. Barrett, Mrs. Barrett.
You must obey.</i>

26:44.246 --> 26:47.115
<i>If you obey,
you will be safe here.</i>

26:47.382 --> 26:50.486
<i>If you obey, we will
let you go.</i>

26:50.719 --> 26:51.753
What do you want?

26:54.156 --> 26:57.759
<i>We know everything you did.</i>

26:59.795 --> 27:00.829
What does that mean?

27:01.830 --> 27:04.533
- I... I don't know.
- <i>You must obey.</i>

27:04.766 --> 27:07.870
<i>You must obey. You must obey.</i>

27:08.036 --> 27:10.506
<i>You must obey. You must...</i>

27:11.607 --> 27:12.574
Come on.

28:01.390 --> 28:05.394
Dammit!

28:08.830 --> 28:10.065
Stay here.

28:12.001 --> 28:13.168
Henry...

28:13.468 --> 28:14.303
It's all locked.

28:15.004 --> 28:17.472
Everything's locked back here.

28:19.374 --> 28:22.744
Henry!

28:32.055 --> 28:33.322
Try the sliding glass door.

28:57.646 --> 29:00.083
Hey, hey, what's wrong?
What's wrong?

29:00.382 --> 29:04.186
Let me see. Let me see.

29:09.458 --> 29:10.692
What is that?

29:11.293 --> 29:12.427
There's something
under your skin.

29:12.728 --> 29:14.863
<i>You were told not to leave.</i>

29:15.497 --> 29:18.266
<i>Disobedience has consequences.</i>

29:19.035 --> 29:20.168
What the hell is this?

29:20.402 --> 29:22.704
<i>You brought this
on yourselves.</i>

29:23.171 --> 29:24.941
<i>We don't want to hurt you.</i>

29:25.407 --> 29:28.143
<i>If you obey,
you will be safe here.</i>

29:28.276 --> 29:29.444
Oh, bullshit!

29:30.345 --> 29:33.248
<i>We are watching over you.</i>

29:35.317 --> 29:38.054
<i>Do not touch the cameras.</i>

29:38.220 --> 29:40.689
Henry!

29:44.192 --> 29:46.628
Henry.

29:57.372 --> 30:01.309
<i>While you are here,
you will do as you are told.</i>

30:01.978 --> 30:03.311
<i>You will obey.</i>

30:03.512 --> 30:06.248
<i>Obedience is the root
of all happiness.</i>

30:06.715 --> 30:10.119
<i>Without a strong foundation,
the tree cannot grow,</i>

30:10.519 --> 30:13.990
<i>cannot blossom,
cannot become beautiful.</i>

30:14.656 --> 30:17.826
<i>Now, go to the bedroom.</i>

30:37.345 --> 30:38.580
<i>Stop.</i>

30:39.781 --> 30:43.618
<i>A man should open the door
for his wife.</i>

30:57.466 --> 30:58.633
<i>Mrs. Barrett...</i>

31:00.002 --> 31:02.604
<i>smile and thank your husband.</i>

31:11.214 --> 31:12.314
Thank you.

31:26.129 --> 31:27.496
<i>Clean yourselves.</i>

31:28.296 --> 31:32.367
<i>Mrs. Barrett, we left makeup
for you in the vanity.</i>

31:42.811 --> 31:45.647
- How's your head?
- It's fine.

31:46.883 --> 31:47.783
How's yours?

31:49.751 --> 31:52.821
<i>Mr. Barrett, a husband
should be giving.</i>

31:53.256 --> 31:56.525
<i>There is a gift in the drawer,
give it to your wife.</i>

32:38.034 --> 32:41.603
- What is that?
- It's by Thomas Wyatt.

32:42.771 --> 32:44.673
From the poetry book
I have at home.

32:45.807 --> 32:47.109
Emma, how would they know that?

32:47.944 --> 32:51.546
<i>Mr. Barrett,
put the perfume on her.</i>

32:59.688 --> 33:00.822
Bruising's spreading.

33:06.896 --> 33:09.065
I'm gonna get us
out of here, I promise you.

33:09.932 --> 33:11.600
- We just... we gotta...
- <i>Both of you</i>

33:11.766 --> 33:13.202
<i>will go to the kitchen.</i>

33:13.768 --> 33:15.071
<i>And, Mrs. Barrett,</i>

33:15.271 --> 33:17.974
<i>you will prepare dinner
for your husband.</i>

33:27.250 --> 33:31.954
<i>No! A man should open
the door for his wife.</i>

33:47.937 --> 33:49.005
Thank you.

33:57.512 --> 34:00.715
<i>Mrs. Barrett,
we left an apron for you.</i>

34:03.252 --> 34:05.687
<i>Mr. Barrett, go to the foyer.</i>

34:06.122 --> 34:08.991
<i>You will find a laptop
behind the books.</i>

34:09.791 --> 34:11.193
<i>Bring it to the kitchen.</i>

34:13.896 --> 34:15.131
It's all right. Be right back.

34:35.817 --> 34:38.120
- You all right?
- Yeah.

34:47.462 --> 34:48.797
There's no Wi-Fi.

34:50.732 --> 34:52.201
<i>Return to your cooking.</i>

34:54.303 --> 34:56.638
<i>Open the folder, Mr. Barrett.</i>

35:15.157 --> 35:17.792
Henry, what is it?

35:21.663 --> 35:24.967
<i>Read it to Mrs. Barrett.</i>

35:33.009 --> 35:35.510
"Every time I lay my eyes
upon you,

35:36.412 --> 35:37.947
I fall more deeply in love."

35:46.521 --> 35:47.655
Um...

35:51.360 --> 35:52.761
"It's been four days since
I saw you,

35:52.895 --> 35:54.729
yet it seems like an eternity."

36:01.303 --> 36:04.206
"I can still smell your perfume
on my sheets."

36:05.874 --> 36:08.177
"I can't imagine anything
greater than...

36:10.112 --> 36:13.115
lying in bed together with
my arms wrapped around you."

36:14.984 --> 36:18.020
"To smell your hair and...

36:19.021 --> 36:21.223
gently kiss your neck and...

36:23.025 --> 36:26.962
<i>Continue cooking,
keep reading.</i>

36:32.867 --> 36:34.937
"I love you.
I love everything about you."

36:45.981 --> 36:48.583
Emma, please say
this isn't what it looks like.

36:51.487 --> 36:53.255
<i>Love</i>

36:53.588 --> 36:55.757
<i>does not delight in evil,</i>

36:56.591 --> 36:58.793
<i>but rejoices in the truth.</i>

36:58.928 --> 37:01.130
<i>The truth may be
difficult to hear.</i>

37:01.363 --> 37:04.100
<i>But the truth will purify
your marriage.</i>

37:04.799 --> 37:06.768
<i>So I know you're a little
indisposed at the moment,</i>

37:06.902 --> 37:10.839
- <i>but I did hire the paparazzi.</i>
- <i>No. No.</i>

37:11.240 --> 37:12.874
<i>A little Q&A.
I invited the media...</i>

37:13.008 --> 37:14.609
- <i>No, Ryan!</i>
- <i>...to come hang out with us...</i>

37:14.742 --> 37:19.081
<i>No, no, no. Oh my God! No, no.</i>

37:19.681 --> 37:22.118
- <i>Stay here tonight.</i>
- <i>You know I can't.</i>

37:22.284 --> 37:24.120
- <i>You can't?
- No.</i>

37:30.092 --> 37:31.360
<i>You still taste like wine.</i>

37:33.195 --> 37:36.565
<i>Stop!</i>

37:37.399 --> 37:40.035
<i>You will have dinner
together tonight.</i>

37:41.504 --> 37:43.105
<i>It's your anniversary.</i>

37:44.373 --> 37:46.208
<i>A sweet anniversary...</i>

37:47.409 --> 37:52.714
<i>that you will spend together
as husband and wife.</i>

38:18.541 --> 38:22.344
<i>Mr. Barrett,
compliment your wife's cooking.</i>

38:30.653 --> 38:31.819
It's good.

38:38.594 --> 38:39.861
I recognized him.

38:44.233 --> 38:46.302
- It's over.
- Who was it?

38:49.538 --> 38:52.274
Emma... Hey.

38:55.411 --> 38:57.313
Hey, look at me, okay?

38:58.247 --> 38:59.882
Because I have a right to know
who my wife

39:00.015 --> 39:01.716
has been sleeping with.

39:05.421 --> 39:08.991
It's Ryan...
...Ryan Sullivan.

39:22.104 --> 39:23.738
You've been lying to me.

39:24.872 --> 39:26.008
And um...

39:26.976 --> 39:30.845
over and over.
For... for how long?

39:32.581 --> 39:34.049
Henry, it's over.

39:34.782 --> 39:36.352
- I swear...
- How long, Emma?

39:43.158 --> 39:45.827
It started at the Jacobsons'
Halloween party.

39:48.063 --> 39:49.298
Henry, please, I swear
it's over.

39:49.431 --> 39:51.166
I mean, does he...
does he love you?

39:54.103 --> 39:56.205
I... I don't know.

39:56.705 --> 39:59.942
<i>Don't lie to him,
Mrs. Barrett.</i>

40:03.078 --> 40:06.282
He's been calling, texting.

40:06.781 --> 40:09.218
Henry, Henry, it was a mistake.

40:09.351 --> 40:11.453
It doesn't look like a mistake,
Emma!

40:13.522 --> 40:15.624
Come on, man,
it looks like you guys...

40:16.425 --> 40:18.694
- It looked like...
- I swear it's over.

40:18.826 --> 40:20.729
It's not over for him though,
is it?

40:20.929 --> 40:22.197
Henry, I'm sorry.

40:22.331 --> 40:23.666
- You're gonna leave me?
- No.

40:23.798 --> 40:25.000
Were you gonna
leave me?

40:25.167 --> 40:26.635
God, no, Henry,
I was not gonna leave you.

40:26.834 --> 40:28.537
- Emma, don't you lie to me.
- It's over I ended it with him.

40:28.671 --> 40:29.871
I swear.

40:30.406 --> 40:32.041
- Please, I am here with you.
- Does he... does he love you?

40:32.174 --> 40:34.143
- I am here with you.
- You're not over here with me!

40:34.276 --> 40:37.012
You're not here with me.

40:37.446 --> 40:40.848
You always push me away.

40:41.183 --> 40:44.353
Is it because of him?

40:44.987 --> 40:46.255
You're not here with me.

40:47.122 --> 40:49.325
I'm sorry. Please, just...

40:49.692 --> 40:53.429
please, let's just talk
about it, please. I'm so sorry.

41:57.993 --> 42:02.931
<i>Dance with your wife.</i>

42:10.439 --> 42:11.373
No.

42:13.142 --> 42:15.210
<i>You must obey.</i>

42:16.044 --> 42:17.212
No.

42:21.383 --> 42:24.653
<i>Disobedience has consequences.</i>

42:30.492 --> 42:33.195
<i>Dance with your wife,
Mr. Barrett.</i>

42:58.854 --> 43:00.155
- Henry.
- Don't.

43:04.059 --> 43:05.961
<i>Kiss your wife.</i>

43:27.749 --> 43:29.818
<i>Go to your wife</i>

43:29.953 --> 43:31.253
<i>and kiss her.</i>

43:41.965 --> 43:43.265
<i>Good.</i>

43:46.869 --> 43:49.705
<i>Now, take off her dress.</i>

44:04.219 --> 44:05.521
<i>Do it.</i>

44:29.012 --> 44:30.445
<i>Remove his shirt.</i>

44:41.891 --> 44:44.126
<i>Say you love him.</i>

44:47.796 --> 44:48.797
I love you.

44:49.464 --> 44:52.768
<i>Look at him and tell him
you love him.</i>

45:00.175 --> 45:01.343
I love you.

45:07.516 --> 45:08.850
<i>Mr. Barrett...</i>

45:09.986 --> 45:11.687
<i>make love to your wife.</i>

45:20.262 --> 45:22.464
<i>Lay on the bed, Mrs. Barrett.</i>

45:40.382 --> 45:42.284
<i>Go to her.</i>

45:56.331 --> 46:00.602
<i>Close your eyes
and kiss your wife.</i>

46:21.490 --> 46:23.458
You know I want you, don't you?

46:27.529 --> 46:30.265
<i>Say you want him too.</i>

46:34.736 --> 46:35.804
I want you.

46:51.520 --> 46:52.989
If you want me to stop...

47:22.417 --> 47:25.587
- No. I'm not gonna do this.
- No.

47:25.721 --> 47:27.422
- Not like this!
- Just do what they want.

47:28.991 --> 47:32.360
Henry! No. No. Stop! Stop!

47:32.728 --> 47:35.898
He'll do what you want!
Stop!

47:36.832 --> 47:38.901
Henry. Henry.

47:42.004 --> 47:43.238
Henry.

47:43.371 --> 47:47.509
Henry. Are you okay?

47:47.642 --> 47:51.513
- I'm okay.
- Oh, my God.

48:04.292 --> 48:05.627
How bad is it?

48:07.163 --> 48:08.797
It isn't bleeding anymore.

48:14.836 --> 48:18.507
- Henry, I'm... so...
- Hey...

48:20.977 --> 48:21.944
I'm...

48:23.578 --> 48:24.981
I'm the one that's sorry.

48:29.317 --> 48:31.286
I know I... I haven't been...

48:37.692 --> 48:39.628
Just lately I've felt like...

48:42.297 --> 48:44.366
I'm... I'm losing control...

48:46.903 --> 48:48.637
work, Graham.

48:51.439 --> 48:53.910
I lost Emily,
and now I'm losing you.

48:55.377 --> 48:59.882
No, you're not. I'm right here.

49:06.555 --> 49:07.856
Why didn't you tell me to stop?

49:15.164 --> 49:16.098
I don't know.

49:17.532 --> 49:19.701
I just froze.

49:25.540 --> 49:26.808
I didn't scream.

49:29.811 --> 49:31.914
I didn't try to fight him off.

49:34.783 --> 49:36.252
I just let it happen.

49:44.593 --> 49:45.995
<i>That wasn't your fault.</i>

49:47.863 --> 49:51.067
I replay that night
over and over.

49:53.169 --> 49:54.469
I wish I'd...

49:59.308 --> 50:04.713
Nothing like that will ever
happen to you again.

50:06.315 --> 50:08.850
And I will do whatever it takes
to make sure it doesn't.

50:10.219 --> 50:11.453
You hear me?

50:25.533 --> 50:27.836
<i>Willing obedience brings joy.</i>

50:28.470 --> 50:32.108
<i>Willing obedience is an act
of faith in your marriage,</i>

50:32.474 --> 50:35.644
<i>the root of your union.
The foundation of your...</i>

50:44.287 --> 50:46.488
<i>Hello? Hello.</i>

50:48.391 --> 50:49.658
<i>Mrs. Barrett?</i>

50:50.960 --> 50:54.964
<i>Mrs. Barrett, it's Joe.
I drove you here.</i>

50:56.198 --> 50:57.465
Oh, my God.

51:01.037 --> 51:03.672
<i>I found your notebook
in my car.</i>

51:05.074 --> 51:07.742
- <i>Are you home?</i>
- Hey, hey, hey, over here.

51:07.876 --> 51:09.145
<i>I'll leave your notebook here.</i>

51:09.278 --> 51:12.248
- Hey, hey!
- God, it's Joe.

51:12.781 --> 51:16.352
It's Joe. Joe. Joe!

51:16.584 --> 51:18.120
- <i>I wanted to apologize.</i>
- Joe!

51:18.853 --> 51:20.522
- Joe! Come on! I'm in here!
- <i>I shouldn't have</i>

51:20.655 --> 51:21.790
<i>asked you for the tip.</i>

51:23.893 --> 51:27.163
- He can't hear us.
- Hey! Hey! Hey, over here!

51:27.330 --> 51:28.563
Over here!

51:28.763 --> 51:31.901
<i>My daughter...
she's in hospital and...</i>

51:32.867 --> 51:34.736
- <i>the bills.</i>
- Help us!

51:34.904 --> 51:36.771
- Help us!
- Here, here, here.

51:37.672 --> 51:38.908
What are you doing?

51:39.375 --> 51:40.910
Okay, I'll leave you.

51:46.048 --> 51:47.682
- Please, please.
- Hey! Hey, look over here.

51:47.816 --> 51:49.185
Come on. Look over here, Joe.

51:54.290 --> 51:56.292
<i>Over here, Joe.</i>

51:57.059 --> 51:59.295
<i>Joe!</i>

51:59.728 --> 52:03.232
<i>Joe!</i>

52:03.865 --> 52:05.201
<i>Joe!
Joe, over here!</i>

52:08.037 --> 52:10.839
<i>Mrs. Barrett, I'm coming!</i>

52:14.243 --> 52:16.946
- Henry. Henry, look!
- Yeah.

52:19.048 --> 52:21.884
He's coming. He's coming.
He's coming!

52:22.018 --> 52:24.552
Yes! Over here! He's coming.

52:27.756 --> 52:31.793
No, no.

52:32.461 --> 52:36.298
No, no, no.

52:36.831 --> 52:38.300
What happen...
what happened? Hey!

52:40.702 --> 52:42.972
No! No!

52:45.640 --> 52:48.444
We see you.

52:48.643 --> 52:51.280
Hey, it's okay.

52:51.746 --> 52:53.149
It's okay. Hey.

52:54.383 --> 52:57.353
It's okay. It's all right.

52:57.520 --> 53:00.489
Hey, I'm gonna
take care of you. Okay?

53:00.990 --> 53:03.225
Come here. Come here.

53:03.893 --> 53:07.263
Oh, you're safe.

53:11.666 --> 53:15.037
He's gone for now.

53:33.522 --> 53:38.194
Henry, it's just been one person
talking to us, right?

53:40.762 --> 53:42.164
Well, we... we don't know that.

53:42.831 --> 53:46.102
But maybe.
And if he's outside...

53:47.369 --> 53:49.004
Hey. No, wait.

53:50.172 --> 53:51.840
Emma, stop it. Hey, hey, wait.
Hang on.

53:51.974 --> 53:54.176
Listen, they could be back
any time. No, listen.

53:54.510 --> 53:55.710
Hey, look. What if this...

53:55.844 --> 53:57.246
<i>what if this is a test
or something?</i>

53:57.379 --> 53:59.081
- <i>You know? Maybe we should...</i>
- <i>Come on.</i>

53:59.215 --> 54:00.316
<i>I don't know if we should be
doing this, you know?</i>

54:18.934 --> 54:20.069
I don't think anyone's watching.

54:20.202 --> 54:21.537
- We don't know that.
- Henry.

54:21.703 --> 54:22.837
Henry, I saw something
here that...

54:23.239 --> 54:24.873
I... I spilled some wine
the other night. I...

54:25.007 --> 54:26.808
- What are you doing?
- I think there could be

54:26.942 --> 54:30.079
a crawl space under here.
Come on, Henry, help me.

54:33.282 --> 54:34.183
Okay.

54:38.020 --> 54:40.422
Emma, hey.

54:41.823 --> 54:43.658
Honey, I don't think
this is a good idea.

54:45.261 --> 54:46.362
We have to try.

54:48.464 --> 54:52.301
All right. Just... be careful,
please.

55:11.620 --> 55:12.754
Emma.

55:27.369 --> 55:30.606
Emma, I think there's someone
at the front door. Emma?

55:31.207 --> 55:33.708
Emma, Emma,

55:33.909 --> 55:35.743
get out. Someone's here, Emma.

55:50.492 --> 55:51.493
Henry!

57:30.125 --> 57:31.994
Someone's in the house.

57:36.198 --> 57:38.100
Who is that?

58:10.099 --> 58:12.534
Ryan.

58:23.846 --> 58:25.514
- Hey.
- <i>No, Mrs. Barrett.</i>

58:25.681 --> 58:26.682
He's watching us.

58:27.182 --> 58:29.017
<i>Do not touch him.</i>

58:45.000 --> 58:46.101
Emma?

58:47.903 --> 58:50.038
Hey. Hey.

58:50.172 --> 58:52.541
<i>You will not untie him.</i>

58:53.642 --> 58:54.943
Who is that?

58:56.979 --> 58:59.314
No, Emma. Don't.

59:01.885 --> 59:03.051
Henry...

59:05.621 --> 59:08.190
What's going on, huh?

59:15.063 --> 59:16.331
What's going on here?

59:18.133 --> 59:20.769
Emma.

59:21.570 --> 59:23.907
- Em... Emma, untie me.
- I can't.

59:24.440 --> 59:26.742
What?

59:27.176 --> 59:29.211
- Emma.
- What the hell do you want?

59:30.712 --> 59:32.181
Why'd you bring him here?

59:32.448 --> 59:36.185
<i>There are consequences
to your actions, Mrs. Barrett.</i>

59:36.418 --> 59:40.122
- Emma. Emma, untie me.
- She can't.

59:41.723 --> 59:44.393
Henry, untie me, please!

59:45.994 --> 59:47.596
You've been screwing my wife.

59:49.198 --> 59:51.266
- Why should I help you?
- Henry.

59:51.600 --> 59:53.435
- Please.
- Don't look at her.

59:54.670 --> 59:57.907
Calm down, all right.
It's all over.

59:58.040 --> 1:00:00.042
I'm sorry, okay.
But she ended it.

1:00:00.175 --> 1:00:01.276
You're gonna make this better?

1:00:01.677 --> 1:00:03.947
- It's over.
- That's my wife!

1:00:04.179 --> 1:00:05.347
Did you even think
for a second,

1:00:05.481 --> 1:00:06.849
- what you were doing?
- Stop it.

1:00:06.982 --> 1:00:09.084
- Henry, no, no, please.
- We had a good marriage,

1:00:09.351 --> 1:00:10.419
and we were happy.

1:00:10.686 --> 1:00:12.154
If you were
so happy together,

1:00:12.287 --> 1:00:13.655
why did she end up in bed
with me, huh?

1:00:13.789 --> 1:00:15.123
- Please, stop.
- Huh?

1:00:15.257 --> 1:00:16.792
Don't do this. No!

1:00:17.626 --> 1:00:20.729
- No.
- <i>Stop! Henry, stop!</i>

1:00:26.335 --> 1:00:28.670
<i>Give the knife to Mrs. Barrett.</i>

1:00:33.375 --> 1:00:37.012
<i>She must kill him.</i>

1:00:37.246 --> 1:00:39.081
- No.
- No.

1:00:39.448 --> 1:00:41.416
No, no, no, no!
Emma, listen,

1:00:41.617 --> 1:00:43.585
- this is insane.
- No, please.

1:00:43.719 --> 1:00:45.721
- No, I can't.
- Okay?

1:00:45.854 --> 1:00:49.558
<i>You will kill Ryan,
or we will kill your husband.</i>

1:00:51.961 --> 1:00:55.097
No!

1:01:01.537 --> 1:01:03.105
<i>Make a decision,
Mrs. Barrett.</i>

1:01:03.238 --> 1:01:06.074
No!

1:01:06.208 --> 1:01:08.210
<i>Or he will die!</i>

1:01:09.111 --> 1:01:13.849
Emma, no!

1:01:14.082 --> 1:01:14.984
Emma, no.

1:01:15.317 --> 1:01:16.385
- Emma!
- <i>You know</i>

1:01:16.518 --> 1:01:18.053
<i>what must be done.</i>

1:01:19.288 --> 1:01:21.189
Don't do it.

1:01:21.356 --> 1:01:23.759
<i>You must cleanse
your marriage.</i>

1:01:24.493 --> 1:01:27.030
Emma, listen. Listen to me.
Okay?

1:01:27.162 --> 1:01:29.498
- <i>Rid it of this stain.</i>
- It's me. All right?

1:01:29.631 --> 1:01:31.133
Just untie me.

1:01:31.266 --> 1:01:32.534
<i>Will you let
your husband die?</i>

1:01:32.668 --> 1:01:34.069
I swear to God, I'll get us out
of here, Emma.

1:01:34.202 --> 1:01:35.137
Emma!

1:01:35.270 --> 1:01:36.705
You don't have to do this.

1:01:36.940 --> 1:01:39.474
<i>There is only one way
to save your husband.</i>

1:01:40.576 --> 1:01:42.544
- Emma!
- <i>You must cleanse</i>

1:01:42.678 --> 1:01:45.314
<i>your marriage, Mrs. Barrett.</i>

1:01:46.148 --> 1:01:47.849
<i>One of them will die.</i>

1:01:48.017 --> 1:01:51.253
- Listen. I love you. Okay.
- <i>He doesn't love you.</i>

1:01:51.553 --> 1:01:52.922
<i>He carved up your marriage.</i>

1:01:53.056 --> 1:01:54.156
Please.

1:01:54.289 --> 1:01:55.892
- <i>You must obey.</i>
- No.

1:01:56.025 --> 1:01:57.626
- <i>You must obey.</i>
- Emma!

1:01:57.759 --> 1:02:00.395
<i>You must obey!</i>

1:02:12.107 --> 1:02:14.376
Ryan, Ryan, I'm sorry.

1:02:14.978 --> 1:02:17.746
I'm so sorry, Ryan. Oh, my God.

1:02:18.081 --> 1:02:19.615
No, no.

1:02:20.917 --> 1:02:25.821
No, no, no, no, no.

1:02:26.755 --> 1:02:31.560
Oh my God!

1:02:31.827 --> 1:02:33.997
It's all right.
It's okay.

1:02:34.262 --> 1:02:38.034
It's okay. It's okay.

1:02:38.233 --> 1:02:39.434
All right.

1:02:40.402 --> 1:02:44.007
It's okay.

1:02:44.272 --> 1:02:47.342
All right.

1:03:47.502 --> 1:03:48.603
Hey, Em...

1:04:05.154 --> 1:04:06.122
I don't know how...

1:04:06.254 --> 1:04:07.422
What could you have done?

1:04:11.727 --> 1:04:13.495
Well, you could've let him
kill me.

1:04:14.763 --> 1:04:15.731
No.

1:04:22.604 --> 1:04:24.473
I don't know what I'd do
without you.

1:04:34.984 --> 1:04:36.085
I'm gonna keep you safe.

1:04:37.086 --> 1:04:39.989
No one could blame you
for what happened.

1:04:41.190 --> 1:04:42.824
You did what you had to do.

1:04:43.658 --> 1:04:46.661
I promise. We're together.

1:04:48.898 --> 1:04:52.801
And no matter what happens,
we're getting out of here...

1:04:53.802 --> 1:04:54.803
together.

1:04:58.473 --> 1:04:59.641
I love you.

1:05:04.180 --> 1:05:05.313
I love you.

1:05:10.652 --> 1:05:12.587
All right. Hey, um...

1:05:14.223 --> 1:05:15.524
get some rest, okay?

1:05:38.847 --> 1:05:43.052
Here, this'll help.

1:05:46.688 --> 1:05:48.157
Hey, I want you to stay in here.

1:05:48.291 --> 1:05:49.926
Okay? I'm gonna go in there
and clean everything up.

1:05:50.927 --> 1:05:52.828
You never have to see him
like that ever again.

1:06:20.455 --> 1:06:21.656
Henry...

1:09:09.657 --> 1:09:10.792
Henry...

1:10:44.120 --> 1:10:45.321
<i>How was your day, dear?</i>

1:10:45.488 --> 1:10:47.189
<i>Just one hell of a day,
Jane.</i>

1:10:47.323 --> 1:10:49.291
- <i>Signed two new accounts.</i>
- <i>Oh, Nathan,</i>

1:10:49.525 --> 1:10:50.792
<i>that's wonderful!</i>

1:10:51.427 --> 1:10:53.028
<i>What's for dinner,
sweetheart?</i>

1:10:53.229 --> 1:10:55.397
<i>All of your
favorites, of course.</i>

1:10:55.531 --> 1:10:56.831
<i>Ah, Jane,</i>

1:10:57.066 --> 1:10:58.400
<i>you'd do anything for me,
wouldn't you?</i>

1:10:58.633 --> 1:11:00.269
<i>Anything at all, my love.</i>

1:11:04.672 --> 1:11:06.641
<i>Isn't that Heaven on Earth?</i>

1:11:07.409 --> 1:11:08.710
<i>It's the way
a marriage should be.</i>

1:11:09.111 --> 1:11:11.514
<i>Before feminism
and political correctness</i>

1:11:11.646 --> 1:11:12.915
<i>muddied the waters.</i>

1:11:13.681 --> 1:11:15.683
<i>Simpler, better times.</i>

1:11:16.218 --> 1:11:19.421
<i>Make no mistake,
marriage is hard work. But...</i>

1:11:20.523 --> 1:11:21.789
<i>what if I told you</i>

1:11:22.491 --> 1:11:25.127
<i>there was a way to get
that spark back</i>

1:11:25.427 --> 1:11:29.098
<i>and reestablish order
in your house?</i>

1:11:30.399 --> 1:11:32.902
<i>There is a way.
Welcome to The Eden Group.</i>

<i>The Eden Group sounded
too good to be true.</i>

1:11:55.157 --> 1:11:57.159
<i>After having a couple kids,</i>

1:11:57.326 --> 1:11:59.028
<i>my wife had really
let herself go.</i>

1:11:59.295 --> 1:12:00.963
<i>After our time
at The Eden Group,</i>

1:12:01.397 --> 1:12:03.232
<i>she's back to being the woman
I married.</i>

1:12:03.532 --> 1:12:04.799
<i>And then some.</i>

1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:06.402
<i>Instead of coming home
to a decent meal,</i>

1:12:06.535 --> 1:12:08.237
<i>it was just a lot of yelling
and screaming.</i>

1:12:08.437 --> 1:12:11.473
<i>Our weekend with The Eden
Group, saved our marriage.</i>

1:12:11.640 --> 1:12:12.908
<i>Isn't that right, honey?</i>

1:12:13.808 --> 1:12:14.809
<i>Yes, dear.</i>

1:12:15.511 --> 1:12:18.247
<i>And rest assured,
all problems of infidelity</i>

1:12:18.380 --> 1:12:21.317
<i>will be handled discreetly

<i>So happy.</i>

<i>You can never truly be happy

1:12:27.789 --> 1:12:28.891
<i>in this world.</i>

1:12:29.425 --> 1:12:32.228
<i>And a woman's place
is at her husband's side.</i>

1:12:35.097 --> 1:12:37.032
<i>From all of us here
at The Eden Group,</i>

1:12:37.666 --> 1:12:42.304
<i>join us. Take back control
of your marriage.</i>

1:15:50.159 --> 1:15:53.295
Stop. Blood.

1:15:57.399 --> 1:15:59.301
I could've used more
on my hands.

1:16:00.269 --> 1:16:03.272
Your wife murdered him.
You witnessed it.

1:16:03.639 --> 1:16:05.441
You have all the footage
you need right here.

1:16:05.574 --> 1:16:08.577
I know. But one of your guys
said I could do it.

1:16:09.545 --> 1:16:12.414
Now you have complete control
over your wife...

1:16:13.749 --> 1:16:15.083
as promised.

1:16:16.652 --> 1:16:19.087
You'll be able to hold this
over her head forever.

1:16:34.203 --> 1:16:35.504
You know,
that thing hurt like hell.

1:16:36.205 --> 1:16:38.707
Had to be high enough
for there to be blood, Henry.

1:16:39.308 --> 1:16:41.310
You wanna know what
your wife's was set to?

1:16:56.391 --> 1:16:58.060
There we go.

1:17:09.204 --> 1:17:10.405
It's okay, baby.

1:17:12.441 --> 1:17:14.543
It'll all be over soon.

1:17:47.911 --> 1:17:49.678
So, you're all set,
Mr. Barrett.

1:17:50.879 --> 1:17:52.814
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

1:17:53.515 --> 1:17:54.816
These aren't my keys.

1:18:04.426 --> 1:18:05.594
My apologies.

1:20:00.409 --> 1:20:03.112
No, no, no.

1:20:03.378 --> 1:20:05.681
No, no, no.

1:20:06.481 --> 1:20:07.950
No, no!

1:21:21.023 --> 1:21:25.494
We have ways, Mrs. Barrett,
ways of keeping you quiet.

1:21:28.030 --> 1:21:29.431
And under control.

1:21:37.572 --> 1:21:39.976
You belong to your husband,
Mrs. Barrett.

1:21:41.443 --> 1:21:42.811
You must obey him.

1:21:45.781 --> 1:21:48.784
Just like Eve was created
from Adam.

1:21:49.952 --> 1:21:52.821
The very root of all truth...

1:22:34.197 --> 1:22:35.530
Emma.

1:22:51.346 --> 1:22:54.283
Henry...
Henry, you're all right.

1:22:54.516 --> 1:22:56.219
I was so worried about you.

1:22:56.618 --> 1:22:57.987
I woke up in the car.

1:22:58.420 --> 1:22:59.922
I didn't know
what happened to you.

1:23:00.589 --> 1:23:03.859
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1:23:05.294 --> 1:23:07.196
Yeah, yeah. What happened?

1:23:08.363 --> 1:23:11.533
He attacked me in the car,
I got away and...

1:23:12.201 --> 1:23:14.937
Henry, I think he was the voice
in the house.

1:23:15.204 --> 1:23:17.405
I found these in his pocket.

1:23:18.074 --> 1:23:19.441
We can go home now.

1:23:20.343 --> 1:23:21.509
Henry...

1:23:22.444 --> 1:23:23.745
you were right.

1:23:24.846 --> 1:23:27.449
We are getting out of here...

1:23:30.652 --> 1:23:31.786
together.

1:23:37.159 --> 1:23:40.562
Yeah. Yeah, we are.

1:23:42.464 --> 1:23:43.632
Let's go.

1:24:06.255 --> 1:24:08.590
We should get our...
our stuff out of there.

1:24:09.791 --> 1:24:11.093
I don't want to go back
in there.

1:24:11.227 --> 1:24:13.662
They have our things.
Our... our cell phones.

1:24:17.632 --> 1:24:19.734
I'll wait out here
in case the doors lock.

1:24:19.868 --> 1:24:21.703
- I can let you out.
- No, there... there might be

1:24:21.836 --> 1:24:24.839
more than one guy out here.
He could be watching you.

1:24:26.008 --> 1:24:27.575
You're gonna be safer with me.

1:24:30.012 --> 1:24:31.613
Okay. We'll... we'll put
something in the door,

1:24:31.746 --> 1:24:34.050
and we'll... we'll block it
from closing, okay?

1:24:36.385 --> 1:24:37.786
Emma, come on.

1:24:40.089 --> 1:24:40.990
Come on.

1:25:02.711 --> 1:25:04.246
Aren't you gonna
open the door for me?

1:25:29.138 --> 1:25:30.139
After you.

1:25:33.541 --> 1:25:34.676
Thank you.

1:25:39.982 --> 1:25:41.850
What should we use
for the doorway?

1:26:09.211 --> 1:26:11.579
No!

1:26:11.914 --> 1:26:13.015
- No, no.
- Settle down.

1:26:13.149 --> 1:26:14.582
- Henry, no!
- Settle down.

1:26:14.716 --> 1:26:17.153
Let me...

1:26:22.590 --> 1:26:24.726
Hey. I don't want you
to leave me.

1:26:24.859 --> 1:26:26.295
I thought you were gonna
leave me. I couldn't...

1:26:26.429 --> 1:26:28.064
it's 'cause I love you. Okay?
No one's gonna love you

1:26:28.197 --> 1:26:29.899
as much as I do.
I'm your husband.

1:26:30.032 --> 1:26:31.866
Okay? I'm your husband, okay.

1:26:32.001 --> 1:26:35.137
So, you give me a kiss right now
and you tell me you love me.

1:27:18.180 --> 1:27:21.850
Emma?

1:27:22.717 --> 1:27:23.919
Emma!

1:27:53.082 --> 1:27:56.152
Hey, baby, what do you think
you're doing to me?

1:28:02.391 --> 1:28:04.826
No! No,
don't, please.

1:28:13.801 --> 1:28:14.970
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

1:28:15.104 --> 1:28:16.438
Emma.

1:28:16.771 --> 1:28:19.942
I did all of this for you.

1:28:21.010 --> 1:28:24.446
It's just... I did...
I did all this for us.

1:28:27.049 --> 1:28:29.218
I... I loved you.
You belong to me!

1:28:29.351 --> 1:28:30.818
You're my wife!

1:28:31.086 --> 1:28:33.289
You do what I say!

1:28:35.857 --> 1:28:37.159
Now I gotta kill you.

1:28:39.595 --> 1:28:40.828
Now I gotta kill you.

1:28:54.076 --> 1:28:57.947
I'm sorry! Henry, I'm sorry.

1:28:59.682 --> 1:29:01.951
I was wrong.

1:29:03.152 --> 1:29:05.020
I know my place now.

1:29:05.888 --> 1:29:08.157
I belong to you.

1:29:10.125 --> 1:29:13.495
- Emma, we... we...
- I love you, Henry.

1:29:14.230 --> 1:29:15.631
Emma,
are you saying that you...

1:29:15.763 --> 1:29:17.266
I don't want anyone
but you.

1:29:17.399 --> 1:29:19.935
- Emma, are you...
- Just let me look at you...

1:29:20.936 --> 1:29:22.504
and tell you...

1:29:24.739 --> 1:29:26.075
Are you saying that you...

1:29:27.276 --> 1:29:28.776
...I loved you!

1:29:52.534 --> 1:29:56.905
You bitch!

1:31:08.811 --> 1:31:10.579
Many thanks, Mrs. Barrett.

1:31:15.417 --> 1:31:16.385
Emma.

1:31:18.087 --> 1:31:19.488
Just Emma.
