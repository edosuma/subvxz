WEBVTT

00:06.674 --> 00:09.210
(Door closes)

00:09.243 --> 00:10.544
- (Gasp) Flowers!

00:10.578 --> 00:14.115
Oh, John, I do love how
you keep the magic alive.

00:14.148 --> 00:16.350
- Well, they're not from me,
Moira.

00:16.384 --> 00:20.254
"Sorry for your loss.
She was really something."

00:20.288 --> 00:22.056
- Ew. Who was something?

00:22.090 --> 00:23.391
- Well, I don't know.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.659
They didn't even put their
name on the card.

00:25.693 --> 00:28.129
Alexis: Mom?
- In here.

00:28.162 --> 00:30.298
- Oh, thank God.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.333
The internet says you're dead.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.268
- What? Whadda ya mean?

00:34.302 --> 00:36.104
Who's saying that?
Your mother's not dead.

00:36.137 --> 00:38.072
- I'm standing right here.

00:38.106 --> 00:39.673
- Yeah, well now I know,
but it's weird

00:39.707 --> 00:42.576
'cause they're still saying it.
- So people are believing it?

00:42.610 --> 00:45.413
- Um, well it doesn't help
that Alexis just tweeted

00:45.446 --> 00:49.150
"Goodbye to a great actress,"
with a cool sunglasses emoji.

00:49.183 --> 00:51.552
- Okay, I'm wearing sunglasses
because I'm in mourning, David.

00:51.585 --> 00:54.222
- What is the source
of this falsehood?

00:54.255 --> 00:56.290
And what photo are they using?

00:56.324 --> 01:00.228
- Unclear and primarily
a headshot from the 90's,

01:00.261 --> 01:03.197
so fresh, and young,
and permed.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.465
- So what are you saying?

01:04.498 --> 01:06.700
The entire internet thinks
your mother is dead?

01:06.734 --> 01:09.303
- Um, well not like the entire
internet. (Knock on door)

01:09.337 --> 01:11.472
It's not even trending,
which is actually kind of sad.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.574
- Mhmm.
- That's what you think is sad?

01:13.607 --> 01:15.276
(Door opens)

01:15.309 --> 01:17.411
- Someone just dropped
these off for you.

01:17.445 --> 01:19.513
I'm assuming you're not dead?

01:19.547 --> 01:22.316
- All right, consider this
camel's back broken.

01:22.350 --> 01:24.552
Who sends pink carnations?

01:25.619 --> 01:29.690
♪♪♪

01:31.559 --> 01:33.127
(Door opens)

01:33.161 --> 01:35.296
- Oh Johnny, Johnny,
get over here.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.231
Come on, lemme give you one.

01:37.265 --> 01:41.202
Oh yeah. Oh good,
that feels good, doesn't it?

01:41.235 --> 01:42.470
She's--
- Let it out.

01:42.503 --> 01:44.472
- She's not dead, Roland.
- Boy, it's strange,

01:44.505 --> 01:46.307
I can almost still smell her
perfume.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.342
- It's because I was
just talking to her.

01:48.376 --> 01:50.378
- Well, I understand.
You know,

01:50.411 --> 01:52.546
sometimes I wear Jocelyn's
robe when she's outta town.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.615
- Yeah, it was a misprint,
Roland,

01:54.648 --> 01:56.417
Moira's very much alive.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.320
- Oh, well, thank god! Geez.

01:59.353 --> 02:01.355
You know, I gotta be honest
with you,

02:01.389 --> 02:03.257
this news really
kinda hit me hard.

02:03.291 --> 02:05.626
- That's... very nice.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.495
- Yeah, the first thing
I thought of is

02:07.528 --> 02:10.231
what would happen to the baby
if something happened to us?

02:10.264 --> 02:12.366
- Roland, this is kind
of a heavy conversation

02:12.400 --> 02:15.503
to have at 9 a.m., isn't it?
- Johnny, Johnny,

02:17.271 --> 02:19.673
I want you to be the godfather
to my child.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.443
- What?

02:22.476 --> 02:24.545
- Well, it's a no-brainer,
Johnny.

02:24.578 --> 02:28.649
I mean, we're best friends.
- Yeah... but are we?

02:28.682 --> 02:30.284
- And to mark the occasion,

02:30.318 --> 02:32.720
I wanna take you to
a celebratory lunch.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.755
- Well, that's not necessary.

02:34.788 --> 02:37.591
- Well, nothing's too good for
the godfather of my child.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.330
- I can't believe it.

02:42.363 --> 02:46.767
I mean I literally saw her
walk past the cafe yesterday.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.402
- I know.

02:48.436 --> 02:50.438
- And again you know,
my thing with ghosts?

02:50.471 --> 02:52.273
- Yeah.
- But she didn't seem angry

02:52.306 --> 02:54.275
like the other ones.
- Oh.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.809
- You know, it says here,

02:55.843 --> 02:58.812
that Moira was projected
to be nominated

02:58.846 --> 03:01.482
for 10 Daytime People's
Choice Awards.

03:01.515 --> 03:04.252
- 12!
(All gasp) Oh my god.

03:04.285 --> 03:06.487
- The most projected nominee

03:06.520 --> 03:08.756
to have never actually
been nominated.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.324
- Moira?

03:11.459 --> 03:12.326
- We were just reading an
article that said you were...

03:13.093 --> 03:15.563
- Shh. Fear not.
She hath risen!

03:16.730 --> 03:18.766
(Clapping)

03:18.799 --> 03:21.569
- It's so good to see you.
In the flesh.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.704
- Credit that internet!

03:23.737 --> 03:25.806
Due to careless reporting,

03:25.839 --> 03:29.310
and the gullibility
of the masses,

03:29.343 --> 03:31.445
everyone thinks I've died.

03:31.479 --> 03:33.547
- Yeah, because the news
is everywhere.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.316
- Thank you.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.718
Did you see the byline
by Maria Menounos?

03:37.751 --> 03:40.688
No? How did it go?

03:40.721 --> 03:42.590
(Sighs)

03:42.623 --> 03:45.826
The unsung hero
of afternoon television.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.395
All: (Ahhs...)

03:47.428 --> 03:49.330
- Oh they're singing
my praises now.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.598
All: (Giggle)

03:50.631 --> 03:54.468
- Oh Moira, we are so happy
that you are okay!

03:54.502 --> 03:56.470
- Yes, Jocelyn, thank you.

03:56.504 --> 03:58.839
Can you imagine an alternate
universe

03:58.872 --> 04:01.475
in which I've actually died?

04:02.810 --> 04:05.579
Wow. I wonder
what you'd be saying.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.515
- I don't even wanna think
about it.

04:07.548 --> 04:10.484
- I know, right?
But theoretically,

04:10.518 --> 04:13.554
what do we think we'd
be saying right now?

04:14.655 --> 04:16.624
(Silence)

04:16.657 --> 04:19.727
- Uh, she always kept things
interesting.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.362
- Yeah.

04:21.395 --> 04:25.566
- Or uh... heaven just got
its newest leading lady.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.401
All: (Chuckle)

04:27.435 --> 04:30.904
Alrighty, I think we should
get to rehearsal, okay?

04:30.938 --> 04:33.441
- We can revisit this later.

04:38.446 --> 04:40.381
Alexis: Thank you so much
for taking me out, David.

04:40.414 --> 04:41.782
I really needed it.

04:41.815 --> 04:44.385
Especially after everything
that's going on with Mom.

04:44.418 --> 04:45.786
- Okay, is that the reason,

04:45.819 --> 04:47.521
or is it because I'm
on a buying trip,

04:47.555 --> 04:49.390
and that means you get free
samples?

04:49.423 --> 04:51.459
- We make a very good team,
David.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.594
You do the talking,
and I sample the merchandise.

04:53.627 --> 04:54.928
And speaking of, we might have
to circle back

04:54.962 --> 04:56.664
and get more of these peanut
butter things

04:56.697 --> 04:59.400
from those old farm witches.
- They were Mennonites,

04:59.433 --> 05:00.701
and I would put the peanut
butter square down,

05:01.935 --> 05:03.504
we're about to spend the
afternoon sampling a lot
of cheese.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.706
- Hmm. Nom nom for us, David.

05:05.739 --> 05:08.442
- Never say nom nom, again.

05:08.476 --> 05:10.544
Anyway, this is a very
important account for me.

05:10.578 --> 05:12.413
I've been trying for the past
little while to secure

05:12.446 --> 05:13.947
an exclusivity deal
with this vendor,

05:13.981 --> 05:16.550
but she's very picky
about her retailers.

05:16.584 --> 05:19.553
Everyone's trying to get their
greasy hands on her cheese.

05:19.587 --> 05:20.888
- Ew, David.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.426
Wait, Warner Farms?

05:25.459 --> 05:27.961
Does this cheese woman
have animals on her farms?

05:27.995 --> 05:30.964
Like goats?
Does she have goats?

05:30.998 --> 05:33.601
- Well, we're about to sample
some goat's cheese,

05:33.634 --> 05:36.437
so I would imagine
she has goats on her farm.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.539
- This is Heather Warner's
farm, David.

05:38.572 --> 05:39.640
- I know.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.610
- No, like Heather, Heather.
Like, Ted's Heather.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.878
- What? She's like 50.

05:44.912 --> 05:47.848
- She's 42, and I know! Ugh!

05:47.881 --> 05:49.783
- Okay. (Tires crunch)

05:49.817 --> 05:51.552
You know what?

05:51.585 --> 05:53.621
I can't have your personal
drama

05:53.654 --> 05:55.389
storming over my business
dealings right now,

05:55.423 --> 05:56.924
so I think it's best
if you got out of the car,

05:56.957 --> 05:58.992
and walked home.
- Walked home?

05:59.026 --> 06:00.761
That would take
like 15 minutes, David,

06:00.794 --> 06:02.696
that's absolutely
not happening.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.598
Anyway, don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.

06:04.632 --> 06:07.535
- Okay. Um, then maybe it's
best if you stayed in the car

06:07.568 --> 06:08.802
with the windows down.

06:08.836 --> 06:11.539
- Stop it, David,
I'm not a baby.

06:11.572 --> 06:12.840
(Alexis whines)

06:12.873 --> 06:14.575
(Doors open and shut)

06:14.608 --> 06:16.610
(Birds chirping)

06:17.845 --> 06:19.713
(Crow cawing)

06:26.887 --> 06:28.656
- So just...

06:30.724 --> 06:31.959
(Crow cawing)

06:31.992 --> 06:33.494
(Car rumbles)

06:33.527 --> 06:35.596
- So Roland,
I've been thinking about

06:35.629 --> 06:39.700
your very generous offer
to be godfather to your baby.

06:39.733 --> 06:43.804
- It's not an offer, Johnny,
it's an offer you can't refuse.

06:43.837 --> 06:46.874
- Oh. Ha ha, Marlon Brando.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.576
- Right, but from what movie?

06:48.609 --> 06:52.513
- The Godfather.
- No, from Casino.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.014
- Okay, fine.

06:54.047 --> 06:56.684
It wasn't Casino,
Brando wasn't in Casino, but--

06:56.717 --> 06:58.786
- Hmm?
- Roland,

06:58.819 --> 07:02.055
I assume when you say
godfather that it's, you know,

07:02.089 --> 07:04.558
just an honorary title?

07:04.592 --> 07:06.994
- No. You'd have to step in
and raise my kid

07:07.027 --> 07:08.962
if something happened
to Jocelyn or me.

07:08.996 --> 07:11.532
Which isn't gonna happen,
but you never know in life.

07:11.565 --> 07:14.602
Our house inspector said that
our furnace could go any day.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.937
Oh, and I'm thinking
of getting Joce

07:16.970 --> 07:19.507
his-and-hers cliff diving
lessons for her birthday.

07:19.540 --> 07:23.544
- Oh, yeah, well you see that...
concerns me a little.

07:23.577 --> 07:26.046
- Well, those are just kind
of extreme examples, Johnny.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.616
I mean, other than that I'm
in the prime of good health.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.818
Except for this friggin' mole
on my back.

07:30.851 --> 07:33.954
- Okay, scoop of tuna on the
Mediterranean salad, for you.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.489
- Thank you.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.526
And the usual fried chicken
on a waffle, extra skin.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.528
- Okay.
- I will be right back

07:40.561 --> 07:42.763
with the hot sauce and butter.
- Yes, and the gravy,

07:42.796 --> 07:44.965
Twyla, please.
Thank you. Ah...

07:47.568 --> 07:50.671
- See the thing is, Roland,
I don't think you realize...

07:50.704 --> 07:53.774
...just how big a responsibility
you'd be,

07:56.043 --> 07:58.846
I don't wanna say strapping
to my back, but...

07:58.879 --> 08:01.014
- Well, Johnny, that's why
I'm asking you

08:01.048 --> 08:03.817
because um,
I consider you family.

08:03.851 --> 08:06.587
- Oh. Well, as a family member,

08:06.620 --> 08:09.757
I feel we can say
anything to each other.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.091
- Sure.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.827
- And, quite frankly,
your lifestyle choices

08:13.861 --> 08:15.563
are making me just a little
nervous.

08:15.596 --> 08:18.599
- Don't worry about me.
Mmm mm.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.568
(Roland chokes)

08:20.601 --> 08:22.536
(Coughs)

08:26.106 --> 08:27.975
I'm okay.
- Good.

08:28.976 --> 08:31.579
(Roland coughs)

08:36.750 --> 08:37.718
(Roland coughs)

08:39.953 --> 08:41.889
It's just a little piece
of skin back there.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.924
- Hmm.
(Roland coughs)

08:43.957 --> 08:46.560
I got it. Still good.
- Hmm.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.963
(Brando voice)
Do you wanna have a bite?

08:49.997 --> 08:52.132
I'll give you a bite
you can't refuse.

08:52.165 --> 08:55.035
- No, no, that's okay.
That's fine. I am done.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.606
(Birds chirping)

09:00.073 --> 09:02.643
- Well, this is quite
the spread.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.845
- Hm, yeah.
Look at all this cheese.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.047
Nom nom for...

09:07.080 --> 09:09.583
- I'm glad we could finally
make this happen.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.184
I know I've been a little hard
to pin down.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.120
It's just we're a family-run
business,

09:13.153 --> 09:15.923
and there's an apprehension
about branching out.

09:15.956 --> 09:18.091
- I totally,
totally get that.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.694
We are also a family-run
business.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.062
This is my sister.
- Oh!

09:22.095 --> 09:24.832
- I thought you had a male
business partner.

09:24.865 --> 09:27.067
- Oh, I do. She is an intern.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.202
- Oh.

09:29.236 --> 09:32.205
- Um, in training to be CEO
of executive buying so...

09:32.239 --> 09:36.176
- Okay. Anyway, I just thought
if we partnered together,

09:36.209 --> 09:38.812
we'd be able to extend
your customer base,

09:38.846 --> 09:40.714
and raise your brand awareness.

09:40.748 --> 09:43.817
- Ultimately, like,
raise brand awareness.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.953
- Listen, David,
I love your store.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.788
But I wanna be up front
with you.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.757
I have been approached by
a couple of other retailers

09:49.790 --> 09:51.625
that I have to consider.

09:51.659 --> 09:55.128
- Hm. Someone's in demand,
isn't she? (Laughs)

09:56.429 --> 09:59.099
Which makes sense because
this cheese is amazing and...

09:59.132 --> 10:01.769
like I don't usually love
goat cheese, but...

10:01.802 --> 10:04.972
- Thank you. I do have some
prize-winning goats.

10:05.005 --> 10:07.140
And it doesn't hurt
that I'm dating a vet.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.944
- Fun. Mm hmm.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.846
Must be very helpful for you.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.715
- How's that going?

10:14.748 --> 10:17.985
- You know, there is something
so familiar about your voice.

10:19.286 --> 10:22.222
- Oh. No, people have told me
that I just have like,

10:22.255 --> 10:24.658
one of those voices.
- Mhmm.

10:24.692 --> 10:26.059
Super generic and trill.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.128
Anyway, I just happened
to eat one of those

10:28.161 --> 10:30.163
pieces of blue cheese,

10:30.197 --> 10:33.233
and normally I don't like blue
cheese in my mouth,

10:33.266 --> 10:35.035
but that was very... not bad.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.707
- I am with you.
I wasn't a fan of it either

10:39.740 --> 10:41.675
until I started using it
in salads.

10:41.709 --> 10:43.110
- Oh.
- Speaking of salads,

10:43.143 --> 10:44.978
I just whipped up a big lunch.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.880
I would love it
if you guys could stay.

10:46.914 --> 10:49.349
- Ooh. Ooh.

10:49.382 --> 10:52.786
No, I for one just had like a
very big peanut butter thing,

10:52.820 --> 10:54.855
so I'm feeling pretty...

10:54.888 --> 10:56.757
- Well, I for one did not.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.859
So we would love to stay
for lunch

10:58.892 --> 11:00.994
with an important supplier.
- Great.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.362
By all means, keep sampling,

11:02.395 --> 11:04.097
and I will start bringing out
the food.

11:04.131 --> 11:07.300
Oh um, I hope you don't mind
if my boyfriend joins us?

11:08.736 --> 11:10.370
- I'm sorry?

11:10.403 --> 11:12.706
- Your boyfriend is here?

11:12.740 --> 11:14.374
- Yeah.
- Mhmm.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.877
You know what, I'm realizing
that this might be an
imposition.

11:16.910 --> 11:19.479
Get in the car!
- Not an imposition at all.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.314
Ted?

11:24.017 --> 11:26.954
The clients are gonna stay
for lunch.

11:28.121 --> 11:30.157
Would you mind helping me
set the table?

11:30.190 --> 11:31.491
- Uh, sure.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.761
- Thanks.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.163
(Birds chirping)

11:36.196 --> 11:39.900
♪♪♪

11:44.137 --> 11:46.774
- Oh, Becca DeMornay,
what a sweetheart.

11:46.807 --> 11:50.177
It's times like this you learn
who your true friends are.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.045
(Knock on door)

11:52.079 --> 11:53.480
I'm busy!

11:53.513 --> 11:55.816
Stevie: There's kind of
a situation out here.

11:55.849 --> 11:58.185
- Okay, come in.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.520
(Door opens ahs shuts)

12:00.553 --> 12:03.824
- Oh hey, so there's a reporter
outside, asking questions.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.525
I thought you should know.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.928
- A reporter? Here? Now!

12:07.961 --> 12:10.497
- Yeah, didn't you expect them
to come?

12:10.530 --> 12:13.801
- Well, I thought it might be
contained to the internet.

12:13.834 --> 12:17.170
Is there a scrum?
How many camera crews?

12:17.204 --> 12:19.807
- I think just one.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.810
Unless they all used
the same van.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.146
- No. No, Stevie, no.

12:26.179 --> 12:31.218
This is not, not how I imagined
my resurrection news to break!

12:31.251 --> 12:33.086
Impeccably dressed woman

12:33.120 --> 12:35.488
wanders out of Podunk motel.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.424
No, that's not the headline!

12:37.457 --> 12:40.027
- Okay, well I actually own
this Podunk motel,

12:40.060 --> 12:42.896
and I don't know
what choice you have.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.098
- Well, we have to think
of something.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.200
After all my fans have endured?

12:47.234 --> 12:49.502
No, I can't let them see me
like this.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.238
It would kill Sir Tony Geary.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.840
(Hangers rattle)
No!

12:52.873 --> 12:54.875
No! Ah! Stevie, help me!

12:56.543 --> 12:58.145
Ah! No!
- Okay.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.519
- Wow.
Well, this looks delicious.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.989
Thank you so much
for having us.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.790
Mmm. Mmm.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.829
Well, this quiche is a treat.

13:15.863 --> 13:17.564
I didn't know you'd gotten
into prepared foods?

13:17.597 --> 13:20.400
- I haven't. I just made
this for lunch.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.335
- But if you've ever had her
quiche,

13:22.369 --> 13:24.872
you can definitely say
that it is eggs-cellent.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.473
(All chuckle)
- Ted.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.476
- So how is it you know
each other?

13:29.509 --> 13:31.178
- Um, well...

13:32.212 --> 13:35.849
- Uh... well Alexis and I
worked together.

13:35.883 --> 13:37.617
She used to be my receptionist.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.352
- That's how I know your voice.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.889
You answered the phones
at the vet's clinic.

13:41.922 --> 13:45.492
- Yes! Well, I mean,
like technically

13:45.525 --> 13:48.261
I had more responsibility than
just answering the phones but...

13:48.295 --> 13:51.231
Oh, and Ted is the vet
that you said you were dating.

13:51.264 --> 13:52.565
- Yes.
- Okay,

13:52.599 --> 13:55.435
because when you said vet,
I thought you meant like,

13:55.468 --> 13:56.736
a War Vet.
(Ted laughs)

13:56.769 --> 13:59.072
- Yeah, no definitely not a War
Vet. Damn these fallen arches.

13:59.106 --> 14:02.943
- I mean I must've called there
every day, for months.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.611
- Yes.

14:04.644 --> 14:08.916
Okay, okay. David, see,
now this all makes sense.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.417
- Mhmm.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.886
(Both chuckle)
- The quiche is vivacious,

14:12.920 --> 14:15.088
and that is not a word I use
to describe quiche often,

14:15.122 --> 14:18.658
but you know,
when the time is right.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.561
- You know, Alexis, I feel like
I really need to thank you.

14:21.594 --> 14:25.632
Had you not passed along
all those messages to Ted,

14:25.665 --> 14:28.501
I mean, looked what happened.

14:31.939 --> 14:34.141
- I feel like we owe you,
or something.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.476
- Hmm.

14:36.509 --> 14:39.646
- Well, she's a very generous
person so...

14:41.714 --> 14:44.451
(Awkward silence)

14:44.484 --> 14:47.454
- Well, if you are looking
for a way to thank me,

14:47.487 --> 14:49.456
I know that David
is looking for

14:49.489 --> 14:51.524
exclusivity on your products.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.060
- Ooh, she is good.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.696
(Heather sighs)

14:56.729 --> 14:58.431
Okay, I'm in.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.602
- Um...

15:02.635 --> 15:06.373
Well, that is why she is
one of our finest interns.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.949
- We-we need to get ahead
of this, Stevie.

15:15.983 --> 15:18.518
We must, we must craft
the perfect spin

15:18.551 --> 15:20.954
that both proclaims
I'm not dead,

15:20.988 --> 15:23.690
and explains why I've been
found here.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.725
- Um, okay.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.528
- We'll tell them you
brainwashed me.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.564
- Could you tell then someone
else brainwashed you?

15:31.598 --> 15:34.334
- A cult. A cult.
Our family joined a cult.

15:35.702 --> 15:39.572
There was a charismatic leader,
40 something, very sexual,

15:39.606 --> 15:42.009
had very long hair,
longer than you'd expect,

15:42.042 --> 15:43.643
but it worked.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.445
- How 'bout this idea?

15:45.478 --> 15:48.681
Um, what about telling
the truth?

15:48.715 --> 15:50.450
- Truth serum.
Oh Stevie, yes,

15:50.483 --> 15:52.485
those stories are always
successful.

15:52.519 --> 15:56.456
- No, I meant the actual truth.
- Oh.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.491
- I've been reading what people
have been saying about you.

15:58.525 --> 16:01.294
They're gonna be really
happy you're still around.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.463
- Yeah, I don't think loyalty
was ever in question.

16:03.496 --> 16:06.766
- Then why not come forward and
be honest about where you are?

16:06.799 --> 16:08.568
- Stevie, I don't...

16:08.601 --> 16:11.071
- Okay, that reporter's not
gonna be out there forever.

16:11.104 --> 16:14.074
This is your chance
to tell your own story,

16:14.107 --> 16:16.309
in your own words.

16:16.343 --> 16:19.346
- Like we did during
the writer's strike.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.481
- Right?
You have the opportunity

16:21.514 --> 16:25.285
to create your own headline!
- Yes.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.487
- And honestly, would you
rather be thought of as dead,

16:27.520 --> 16:29.322
than living here?

16:29.356 --> 16:32.459
(Birds chirping)
Mrs. Rose?

16:32.492 --> 16:34.427
- No, I know.
I'm thinking on it.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.598
- Look, Jocelyn,
the last thing I want

16:38.631 --> 16:41.501
is for this conversation
to get... uncomfortable.

16:41.534 --> 16:42.769
- Oh boy.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.671
- But-but there is a delicate
issue

16:44.704 --> 16:46.406
that I wanted to talk about.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.775
- Roland asked if you wanted
to be godfather to the baby.

16:48.808 --> 16:51.644
- Yes!
- He has been asking everybody

16:51.678 --> 16:53.546
to be the godparent.

16:53.580 --> 16:56.083
You're the 3rd person
I've had to talk to today, so.

16:56.116 --> 16:58.385
- Oh, I see.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.387
- I just think he wants
to make sure

17:00.420 --> 17:02.422
that our bases are covered,
you know?

17:02.455 --> 17:05.825
- Well... that's a relief,
that your bases are covered.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.627
- But here's the good news,

17:07.660 --> 17:10.130
if something does happen
to one of our first 3 choices,

17:10.163 --> 17:12.465
we will definitely be knocking
on your door.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.401
- It's all for the best,
Jocelyn,

17:14.434 --> 17:17.070
because frankly the thought
of raising another kid...

17:17.104 --> 17:19.539
- Yeah, well, let's face it,

17:19.572 --> 17:21.708
your first 2 were no walk
in the park, right.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.843
- Well, they're good kids.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.678
- Yeah, I mean you had
a lotta help.

17:25.712 --> 17:29.149
- Yeah, but you know,
we're very capable parents.

17:29.182 --> 17:32.385
- Well if you like, we could
um, move you up the list?

17:32.419 --> 17:35.655
- No, no, no, but this has all
been very, very helpful.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.457
So, thank you.

17:39.592 --> 17:40.727
(Car engine rumbles)

17:41.761 --> 17:43.863
(Rumbles by)

17:43.896 --> 17:46.099
(Slow song plays on radio)

17:47.200 --> 17:49.569
- Ahem, well, that went well.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.471
- Yeah.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.608
- You didn't have to do that.

17:55.642 --> 17:59.679
- I just like,
hate how good this cheese is.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.583
- Thank you.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.719
That wasn't the most
comfortable situation to be in.

18:08.455 --> 18:12.592
- I'm just glad Ted's found
someone so stable and healthy.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.696
- You're in love with him,
aren't you?

18:16.729 --> 18:18.765
- Yes.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.633
Yup.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.474
Moira: I've always had great
affection for the press,

18:27.507 --> 18:28.841
and my fans.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.578
My fans, and the press,
so thank you.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.480
Yes! Yes!

18:35.582 --> 18:37.450
(Clothes rustle)

18:40.620 --> 18:42.155
(Jewellery clinks)

18:43.656 --> 18:45.458
(Bird chirping)

18:47.727 --> 18:50.497
(Car engine rumbles)

18:51.798 --> 18:54.734
(Running footsteps)

18:54.767 --> 18:56.736
(Stevie gasps)
(Door opens)

18:56.769 --> 18:58.905
- Stevie!
(Door closes)

18:58.938 --> 19:01.441
Do you happen to know
where the van went?

19:02.242 --> 19:06.813
- Uh, yeah, apparently there
was another celebrity death.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.783
- Oh, I'm sorry. Who passed?

19:11.651 --> 19:14.887
- Um, you know that
YouTube video

19:14.921 --> 19:17.657
of the giraffe and the kitten
who are best friends?

19:17.690 --> 19:19.826
- Alas, I do not.

19:19.859 --> 19:22.862
- Okay, well the giraffe
stepped on the kitten.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.931
- Well, of course he did.

19:25.932 --> 19:28.801
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.804
- I didn't think you
were gonna talk to them.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.941
- Oh, uh... you know what,
I'm relieved.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.513
Yes, enough of me for one day.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.882
- Yeah, well I mean,
it's pretty amazing

19:42.915 --> 19:43.950
to see how many people
care about you.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.952
- Yeah.
- I mean if I died,

19:45.985 --> 19:49.556
I'd be lucky if 1 person
had something nice to say.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.224
- Oh, Stevie. Stevie,

19:51.258 --> 19:54.627
you have years ahead of you
still to collect a cartage

19:54.661 --> 19:56.563
of adoring mourners.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.765
In the meantime,
they will laugh in your face,

19:58.798 --> 19:59.999
and they'll stab you
in the back,

20:00.032 --> 20:02.001
but the moment you give up
the ghost,

20:02.034 --> 20:04.871
oh they'll all have nothing but
nice things to say about you.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.007
I know I will.

20:08.040 --> 20:12.712
- Thank you, Mrs. Rose.
That's very comforting.

20:12.745 --> 20:15.582
- And I, for one, am through
with trying to impress people.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.885
- I like the outfit you chose.

20:18.918 --> 20:21.020
- Well, you were a big help,
Stevie.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.722
Heading to the cafe.

20:24.023 --> 20:26.259
It's always nice
to dress for dinner.

20:32.031 --> 20:34.033
