What brought you here?

06:59.155 --> 07:00.290
TAMI: The wind, I guess.

07:01.424 --> 07:02.656
I was a cook on a schooner.

07:02.658 --> 07:03.757
But when the gig was up,

07:03.759 --> 07:05.193
I didn't really feel like
going home yet.

Where is home for you?

07:07.363 --> 07:08.897
San Diego. California.

Nice.

07:11.468 --> 07:12.601

07:13.103 --> 07:15.303
Never. (CHUCKLES)

07:15.305 --> 07:17.906
I don't know. Maybe once
I've seen the world.

08:10.226 --> 08:11.526

08:15.231 --> 08:16.997
It's Swazi.

08:16.999 --> 08:19.866

I need a translation, please?

08:19.868 --> 08:21.770
"One who crosses the horizon."

08:22.205 --> 08:23.837
Oh.

Hey.

10:14.417 --> 10:16.419
I thought you may need this.

10:18.288 --> 10:19.821
How thoughtful.

10:20.889 --> 10:22.956
- Thanks, Tami.
- No worries.

10:22.958 --> 10:24.092
Do you, uh,

10:25.295 --> 10:26.761
like fish?

10:26.763 --> 10:28.464
I'm actually a vegetarian.

10:29.097 --> 10:31.197
- (LAUGHING) So...
- Right.

10:31.199 --> 10:32.633
I like them
when they're alive.

10:32.635 --> 10:33.933
- (BOTH CHUCKLE)
- I was gonna see

10:33.935 --> 10:37.039

to grab an early dinner?

10:37.573 --> 10:38.874
Uh...

10:41.411 --> 10:42.543
But seeing as you're...

10:42.545 --> 10:43.411
Do you know what, I can make

10:43.413 --> 10:46.014
a really good
vegetarian version.

10:46.815 --> 10:49.317
That sounds great. (LAUGHS)

10:49.319 --> 10:51.752
- Good, good. Sold.
- Yes. Thank you.

10:51.754 --> 10:53.053

- Done.

10:53.055 --> 10:55.991
Do you want me
to grab anything else?

10:57.493 --> 10:59.227
Uh, some vegetables?

11:00.162 --> 11:02.262
(LAUGHING)

11:02.264 --> 11:03.333
I can do that.

11:06.769 --> 11:08.636
TAMI: You've been
to so many places.

11:08.638 --> 11:09.737
So cool.

11:09.739 --> 11:10.805
RICHARD: Yep.

11:10.807 --> 11:11.905
All on this boat?

11:11.907 --> 11:13.509
Uh, just me and her.

11:14.444 --> 11:15.545
Where did you find her?

11:16.713 --> 11:18.178
I actually built her

11:18.180 --> 11:21.615
when I was working in
a boat yard in South Africa.

11:21.617 --> 11:23.419
You built this boat?

11:23.985 --> 11:25.253
RICHARD: Mmm.

11:26.356 --> 11:27.655
That's a big deal.

11:27.657 --> 11:29.289
- That's so impressive.
- (LAUGHS)

11:29.291 --> 11:30.225
It's not.

11:30.693 --> 11:32.094
It is.

11:33.328 --> 11:34.930
Oh, thank you.

11:39.201 --> 11:40.202
Chin, chin.

11:40.902 --> 11:42.104
Cheers.

11:51.913 --> 11:54.983
What's it like sailing
out there all alone?

11:56.552 --> 11:59.720
Uh... Miserable.

11:59.722 --> 12:01.356
- (CHUCKLES)
- Cold.

12:01.791 --> 12:03.356
Utterly awful.

12:03.358 --> 12:04.792
C'mon...

12:04.794 --> 12:06.126
- (CHUCKLES)
- Seriously?

12:06.128 --> 12:08.529
Yeah, seriously.
I mean, you're either,

12:08.531 --> 12:12.031
uh, sunburnt, sleep-deprived,
or seasick,

12:12.033 --> 12:14.169
usually all three at once,

12:14.837 --> 12:16.537
and constantly hungry.

12:16.539 --> 12:17.838
TAMI: Hmm.

12:17.840 --> 12:19.540
Always wet.

12:19.542 --> 12:22.277
And after a few days
there's the hallucinations.

12:23.579 --> 12:25.780
I'm assuming not the fun kind?

12:25.782 --> 12:27.215
Mmm-mmm. I wish.

12:27.683 --> 12:29.151
(CHUCKLES)

12:33.989 --> 12:35.625
If it's not fun,

12:37.493 --> 12:38.661
then why do you do it?

12:40.530 --> 12:41.597
Uh...

12:43.633 --> 12:45.200
It... It's a feeling...

12:47.135 --> 12:49.404
A feeling I can't describe.

12:50.673 --> 12:53.074
Uh, it's intense.

12:54.075 --> 12:56.044
The infinite horizon.

12:58.280 --> 13:02.650
After a few days,
uh, I feel reborn.

13:02.652 --> 13:04.352
You know, just you,

13:05.721 --> 13:08.188
the wind
and the sound of the boat

13:08.190 --> 13:10.493
cutting through the ocean.

13:15.163 --> 13:17.765
(SMACKS LIPS) I'm sorry,
that was incredibly cheesy.

13:17.767 --> 13:19.234
No.

13:19.802 --> 13:21.136
Not at all, actually.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.709
So you must be a sailor too?

13:27.710 --> 13:28.977
TAMI: Mmm...

13:30.445 --> 13:31.712
I love sailing.

13:31.714 --> 13:34.582
But I don't know that I would
consider myself a sailor.

13:34.584 --> 13:35.883
Oh, come on.

13:35.885 --> 13:38.451
- Not like you.
- Yeah, you are.

13:38.453 --> 13:40.455
- I don't believe you.
- (CHUCKLES)

13:45.227 --> 13:46.729
Do you want to take her out?

13:48.296 --> 13:49.331
Right now?

13:50.432 --> 13:52.465
Uh, sure.

13:52.467 --> 13:55.803

right now or tomorrow.

14:14.590 --> 14:18.258
Hey, the sheet's luffing,
should I pull it in?

14:18.260 --> 14:19.762
I didn't think
you were much of a sailor.

14:20.696 --> 14:22.028
I'm not.

14:22.030 --> 14:23.363
I mean, I learned a few things

14:23.365 --> 14:24.798
when I was a cook
on that schooner.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.637
But definitely never crossed
a horizon all alone like you.
