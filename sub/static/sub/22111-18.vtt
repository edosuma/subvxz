They would like to ask
you some questions

about your little
brother Abram.

Mm, Rybka, you
need a new line.

01:08.503 --> 01:10.200
That's what
you always say.

SOKOLOV:
Don't be cross at Yvgeniy.

Catch me up.

01:54.462 --> 01:55.811
Business is good.

01:55.854 --> 01:56.986
Of course is good.

01:57.029 --> 01:58.857
You are strong, capable woman.

02:01.033 --> 02:02.513
I want to know about you.

02:02.557 --> 02:05.429
Are you happy?

02:05.473 --> 02:06.996
Are you seeing somebody?

02:07.039 --> 02:08.432
No.

02:08.476 --> 02:12.132
No, you're not happy, or no,
you are not seeing anyone?

02:12.175 --> 02:14.351
No.

02:14.395 --> 02:15.744
Well, you should
go online.

02:15.787 --> 02:17.572
Meet someone
who make you laugh.

02:17.615 --> 02:19.574
I don't like to laugh.

02:19.617 --> 02:21.141
Eh. Neither do I.

02:23.404 --> 02:26.015
It's complete waste of energy.

02:34.980 --> 02:37.548
You should not have been
hiding from me, Vladlena.

02:37.592 --> 02:39.985
It make you look

02:40.029 --> 02:41.726
very guilty.

02:41.770 --> 02:43.989
I don't know what
you're talking about.

02:44.033 --> 02:46.122
I had smart,
clean operation here,

02:46.166 --> 02:48.168
turning rubles into dollars.

02:48.211 --> 02:50.692
And no one
has to get hurt.

02:50.735 --> 02:53.216
But someone decide
to get in my way.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.871
And now I have no choice.

02:55.914 --> 02:58.787
A lot of people
are going to get hurt.

02:58.830 --> 03:01.137
Your problems
are not my problems.

03:14.150 --> 03:17.458
Yvgeniy-- he don't even put up
a fight before he tell me

03:17.501 --> 03:18.807
where you would be tonight.

03:18.850 --> 03:21.157
You can
thank me later.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.027
First we eat.

03:22.071 --> 03:24.465
What do you think?

03:24.508 --> 03:27.032
Calamari to start?

♪

04:14.341 --> 04:16.343
You still in bed?

04:16.386 --> 04:17.735
Is Anna here?

Wait, don't tell me.
I don't want to know.

04:20.129 --> 04:21.217
What do you want, Arkady?

04:21.261 --> 04:23.001
Okay, tell me, is
my daughter here?

No.

Good.

04:25.830 --> 04:27.789
What, you came
to check up on Anna?

04:27.832 --> 04:28.920
Well, it's been
long night.

04:28.964 --> 04:31.358
Are you going to
invite me in, or what?

04:31.401 --> 04:33.708
I'm freezing my
ass off out here.

Ay.

Interesting design
concept, yes.

04:42.891 --> 04:47.156
Maybe you could buy
a little furniture or something.

04:47.199 --> 04:49.027
So, what's this about, Arkady?

04:49.071 --> 04:51.029
You remember
Vladlena Sokolov, yes?

04:51.073 --> 04:52.509
Beautiful face,

04:52.553 --> 04:57.340
looks like she could kill
rabid coyote with bare hands?

04:57.384 --> 04:59.864
Yeah. Her brother Abram was
using an investment bank

04:59.908 --> 05:02.345
to launder rubles into
American dollars. I remember.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.913
Exactly.
Well, last night, she--

05:04.956 --> 05:06.044
Callen,

05:06.088 --> 05:07.785
she text me.

05:07.829 --> 05:10.353
Okay.

05:10.397 --> 05:12.573
Women like Vladlena Sokolov
do not text, they do not call,

05:12.616 --> 05:13.922
they do not bake

05:13.965 --> 05:15.967
cherry cheesecake
and come over for a visit.

05:16.011 --> 05:18.709
If you want to talk to her,
you have to go

05:18.753 --> 05:21.712
to her place of business
and spend ridiculous moneys

05:21.756 --> 05:23.497
on poker and vodka.

05:23.540 --> 05:24.236
Is this a joke?

05:24.280 --> 05:25.716
Callen, this is serious.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.718
I went over
to her poker parlor

05:27.762 --> 05:29.329
and waited for her.

05:29.372 --> 05:31.374
She was gone entire night.

05:31.418 --> 05:32.854
This is unheard of.

05:32.897 --> 05:34.769
Okay. What did she text you?

05:39.034 --> 05:41.210
"I need you."

05:41.253 --> 05:42.994
Really?

05:43.038 --> 05:44.779
Yeah.You woke me up to

05:44.822 --> 05:46.998
brag about a little
booty call you got?

05:47.042 --> 05:49.653
Get your head
out of gutter, guy.

05:49.697 --> 05:52.352
Something spooked her.
Trust me,

05:52.395 --> 05:55.659
this is woman that
does not spook easy.

05:55.703 --> 05:57.618
This text is cry for help.

05:57.661 --> 05:59.576
And you think
it involves her brother?

05:59.620 --> 06:01.491
I think he is not thrilled

06:01.535 --> 06:04.842
you spoil his perfect little
money laundering operation.

06:04.886 --> 06:07.628
Even if Sokolov suspected
that she helped us,

06:07.671 --> 06:09.325
we've been tracking him.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.892
He's in Chisinau, Moldova,
right now.

06:10.935 --> 06:12.676
I'm telling you
she is in trouble.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.635
Which means you

06:14.678 --> 06:16.898
and your posse
are in big trouble.

06:21.816 --> 06:23.600
CALLEN:
Good morning.

06:23.644 --> 06:26.342
Good morning. But that does
depend on why I'm here.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.517
Well...

06:27.561 --> 06:29.127
Excellent
water pressure.

06:29.171 --> 06:32.653

need my loofah...

06:34.698 --> 06:37.353
Executive Assistant Director
Shay Mosley,

06:37.397 --> 06:39.007
I would like
to introduce...Arkady Kolcheck.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.356
ARKADY:
Aha, look at that.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.184
You already
hear about me

06:42.227 --> 06:44.360
and the vital assistance
I provide your team

06:44.404 --> 06:46.144
here in Los Angeles.

06:46.188 --> 06:47.885
Do not thank me.

06:47.929 --> 06:50.540
It is my absolute
wondrous pleasure.

06:50.584 --> 06:54.239
Though possibly
you could look on me fondly

06:54.283 --> 06:56.416
if I ever land
in American jail.

06:56.459 --> 06:58.896
Ah. You want to
know what will

06:58.940 --> 07:01.116
land you
in American jail?

07:01.159 --> 07:04.336
Drunk and
disorderly behavior.

07:04.380 --> 07:05.860
What did you do now?

07:05.903 --> 07:07.731
Nothing, I swear.
Oh, that.

07:07.775 --> 07:09.733
Mm-hmm.

07:09.777 --> 07:12.910
This was a couple weeks ago.

07:12.954 --> 07:14.129
You don't want
to hear the audio.

07:14.172 --> 07:15.565
Okay.

07:15.609 --> 07:17.915
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

07:17.959 --> 07:19.264
Abram Sokolov.
You helped us

07:19.308 --> 07:21.484
locate him when he was
trying to arm Ukrainians

07:21.528 --> 07:22.616
with American weapons.

07:22.659 --> 07:23.443
Correct?

07:23.486 --> 07:25.575
Or if I am ever deported.

07:25.619 --> 07:28.099
We put a tracker on Sokolov.

07:28.143 --> 07:29.492
Is he back in L.A.?

07:29.536 --> 07:30.537
Unfortunately,
the Overwatch spray

07:30.580 --> 07:32.364
that we put on him has worn off.

07:32.408 --> 07:33.627
The last known
location

07:33.670 --> 07:34.845
was Moldova.

07:34.889 --> 07:36.499
There's an unconfirmed sighting
in London.

07:36.543 --> 07:41.286
Yeah, but his sister Vladlena,
she text me last night.

07:41.330 --> 07:45.682
Yeah, apparently, that is a
very unusual behavior from her.

07:45.726 --> 07:47.641
And the fact that she hasn't
returned to her poker club

07:47.684 --> 07:49.294
since yesterday evening.

07:49.338 --> 07:51.253
There's a chance that Sokolov
knows that she is responsible

07:51.296 --> 07:53.255
for breaking up his
money laundering scheme,

07:53.298 --> 07:55.562
as well as preventing
the arms deal.

07:55.605 --> 07:57.825
So you think he's coming back
to finish what he started.

07:57.868 --> 07:59.609
Or worse.
Yeah, I've had an agent sent

07:59.653 --> 08:02.525
to the investment bank
where Leigha Winters works.

08:02.569 --> 08:05.136
Uh-huh, the woman he blackmailed
into helping the last time.

08:05.180 --> 08:07.051
Yeah. For Leigha Winters,
it'll be business as usual.

08:07.095 --> 08:09.184
The agent will be there for
her protection in the event

08:09.227 --> 08:10.794
that Sokolov shows up.

08:10.838 --> 08:12.143
If that's okay with you.

08:12.187 --> 08:15.277
So let me get this straight.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.802
You want to use NCIS resources
to locate a Russian criminal

08:18.846 --> 08:21.152
you think might be in town,
even though

08:21.196 --> 08:23.198
you have no proof
and he's been banned

08:23.241 --> 08:25.200
from entering the country,

08:25.243 --> 08:29.030
because his sister sent Arkady
a text message?

08:29.073 --> 08:33.513
Well, when you say it
in that tone, is...

08:33.556 --> 08:35.602
Okay.

08:35.645 --> 08:39.606
Agent Callen,
let me know what you find.

08:39.649 --> 08:42.304
Will do.
And thank you.

08:42.347 --> 08:44.045
Mm-hmm.

08:44.088 --> 08:46.047
"Mm-hmm."

as the I.T. lady.

10:31.456 --> 10:35.069
Better yet, let's send Eric.

10:35.112 --> 10:36.679
He's due.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.289
You think he's up for it?

10:38.333 --> 10:41.641
Well... what's the worst
that could happen?

10:55.045 --> 10:57.482
NELL: So, the Overwatch Spray
we put on Sokolov has worn off

10:57.526 --> 10:59.354
by now, but according
to our tracking information,

10:59.397 --> 11:01.530
he hasn't returned
to the U.S.

11:01.573 --> 11:03.575
MOSLEY: Doesn't mean
he's not here now.

11:03.619 --> 11:05.229
Let's use what we know.

11:05.273 --> 11:07.405
Nell, see if you can find out
which hotel he stayed at

11:07.449 --> 11:09.756
the last time
he was here.

11:09.799 --> 11:11.714
Men are nothing
if not creatures of habit.

11:11.758 --> 11:13.760
NELL: So, if the bar made
stiff drinks and the sheets

11:13.803 --> 11:15.631
had a decent enough
thread count, chances are

11:15.675 --> 11:16.719
he's staying
there again.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.199
All right, ladies.
I'm on it.

11:18.242 --> 11:19.548
MOSLEY:
Uh, Eric,

11:19.591 --> 11:21.245
Nell's got this.

11:21.289 --> 11:23.421
You're going undercover.

11:23.465 --> 11:24.771
Hmm?

11:24.814 --> 11:26.642
Me
Yeah.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.078
Hidoko, I need you on overwatch.

11:28.122 --> 11:29.776
Yes, ma'am.

11:31.342 --> 11:33.997
Go on and get.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.741
Have fun.

11:41.265 --> 11:44.312
Guys, guys,
I'm going undercover.

11:44.355 --> 11:45.879
Word travels fast.

11:45.922 --> 11:47.315
Yeah, well, apparently,
not fast enough.

11:47.358 --> 11:48.664
What's my mission?
What's my backstory?

11:48.708 --> 11:49.839
What's my caffeinated beverage
of choice?

11:49.883 --> 11:51.493
What's the first rule
of going undercover?

11:51.536 --> 11:52.842
Um...

11:52.886 --> 11:54.888
You do not talk about
going undercover.

11:54.931 --> 11:56.716
Right. Of course. Right.

11:56.759 --> 11:59.283
But, seriously, what kind
of lion's den am I walking into?

11:59.327 --> 12:01.329
You're gonna be our eyes
and ears at the investment bank

12:01.372 --> 12:02.417
where Leigha Winters works.

12:02.460 --> 12:03.940
Okay.

12:03.984 --> 12:05.420
Her safety is
your number one priority.

12:05.463 --> 12:06.726
CALLEN: You're gonna
slow down the servers

12:06.769 --> 12:08.292
in the building,
then spend the day fixing them.

12:08.336 --> 12:11.208
Mm. But actually
not fixing them, right?

12:11.252 --> 12:12.601
Because I'm the one
who created the problem

12:12.644 --> 12:13.907
to begin with, so I wouldn't
actually be fixing it,

12:13.950 --> 12:15.386
'cause I would know
how to do it.

12:15.430 --> 12:16.605
And-and, Beale.Yeah.

12:16.648 --> 12:18.912
Absolutely no caffeine.

12:18.955 --> 12:20.696
Good call.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.046
Good call, good call, good call.

12:23.090 --> 12:25.701
Good call, good call.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.703
Good call.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.924
Of all the gin joints
in all the towns...

12:30.967 --> 12:32.447
What

12:32.490 --> 12:34.188
What did you say?I didn't say anything.

12:34.231 --> 12:35.450
Why are you being weird?

12:35.493 --> 12:37.713
You're being weird.
I'm being normal. Hey.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.933
Have you, have you been here
before?

12:39.976 --> 12:41.804
No, I have not
been here before.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.632
HOSTESS:
Deeks!
Oh, God.

12:43.675 --> 12:45.590
It is so great to see you again.

12:45.634 --> 12:46.809
Hey.

12:46.853 --> 12:47.810
And you must be Kensi.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.986
Agent Blye, actually.

12:50.030 --> 12:51.945
You were right.
She is all business.

12:51.988 --> 12:53.381
Excuse me?

12:53.424 --> 12:54.425
You have no idea.

12:54.469 --> 12:55.905
Excuse me?All right, listen,

12:55.949 --> 12:57.211
I have been here before.

12:57.254 --> 12:59.039
Evidently.But it's not what you think.

12:59.082 --> 13:02.259
He came for dinner,
but stayed for dessert.

13:02.303 --> 13:04.696
SeeDid you, now?

13:04.740 --> 13:06.481
That doesn't sound good.

13:06.524 --> 13:09.266
Okay, just-- Here's the deal.
I've been here before,

13:09.310 --> 13:11.355
because I was scoping out
a potential venueMm-hmm.

13:11.399 --> 13:12.792
for our wedding.

13:12.835 --> 13:13.793
Yeah

13:13.836 --> 13:15.055
Our wedding.

13:15.098 --> 13:16.360
Oh, my God.

13:16.404 --> 13:18.145
You have the Spiraling
Circle of Death face.

13:18.188 --> 13:20.408
I literally just melted
your brain.

13:20.451 --> 13:22.149
Your brain broke.
Got to do a hard restart.

13:22.192 --> 13:23.803
Just reboot that.
Did I mention I'm a cop?

13:23.846 --> 13:25.413
Several times.

13:25.456 --> 13:27.545
All right, so we're here
looking for Vladlena Sokolov.

13:27.589 --> 13:29.852
She was here just last night.

13:29.896 --> 13:31.462
And the last time she used her
phone was at this restaurant.

13:31.506 --> 13:32.855
Can you take us
to where she was sitting?

13:32.899 --> 13:34.596
Of course. Right this way.Thank you so much

13:34.639 --> 13:37.512
for being so... wonderful.Thank you. So helpful.

13:42.430 --> 13:46.738
This is where Vladlena ate
last night.

13:46.782 --> 13:49.002
Do you know who
she was with?

13:49.045 --> 13:51.482
We get paid to not
ask questions.

13:51.526 --> 13:54.485
Whoa. You got to be kidding me.

13:54.529 --> 13:56.487
Kens.

13:56.531 --> 13:58.576
I think you're gonna
want to see this.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.842
Well, I hate to admit it,

14:02.885 --> 14:04.408
but I think Arkady's right.

14:04.452 --> 14:06.236
I think Vladlena
really is missing.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.717
And if it's her brother
who's got her...

14:08.760 --> 14:12.503
Leigha Winters is
in some serious trouble, too.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.251
Excuse me.

14:21.295 --> 14:22.600
Hey. Hi.

14:22.644 --> 14:24.907
Uh, I'm the I.T. guy you
guys asked to come out.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.909
Um, do you know where I
could find Leigha Winters?

14:26.953 --> 14:29.825
You know why the servers
slowed down, don't you?

14:29.869 --> 14:33.176
Um, I'm... I-I need to assess
the situation first.

14:33.220 --> 14:36.136
My working theory is
one of the college campuses.

14:36.179 --> 14:37.964
The radical element there
is trying

14:38.007 --> 14:39.966
to disrupt
our entire economic system.

14:40.009 --> 14:42.403
Huh.Victor, is there
a problem?

14:42.446 --> 14:45.319
Not at all.
Was just about to introduce you

14:45.362 --> 14:47.799
to this nice young man who's
gonna save our Internet.

14:47.843 --> 14:49.366
We really appreciate
the help.Uh, anytime.

14:49.410 --> 14:50.933
Uh, Leigha Winters.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.587
Thank you for coming so soon.

14:52.630 --> 14:53.762
Yeah. What seems to be
the problem?

14:53.805 --> 14:54.981
Okay, follow me.

14:56.721 --> 14:59.072
♪

14:59.115 --> 15:00.508
Yeah, I could handle this.

15:00.551 --> 15:03.076
Sokolov does not skimp.

15:03.119 --> 15:05.600
ARKADY :
Eh, I've stayed in nicer.

15:05.643 --> 15:07.254
That better be water
you're drinking.

15:07.297 --> 15:10.605
ARKADY:
Sam, who do you think I am?

15:10.648 --> 15:11.693
I'm on the clock here.

15:11.736 --> 15:12.912
CALLEN:
Oh, you are?

15:12.955 --> 15:14.826
'Cause we sure as hell
aren't paying you.

15:14.870 --> 15:16.828
Yeah, feel free to leave
anytime you want.

15:17.786 --> 15:20.006
Very funny. No, I am working.

15:20.049 --> 15:22.051
I'm trying to find Vladlena.

15:22.095 --> 15:24.749
I'm trying to get Russian thug
off the street.

15:24.793 --> 15:27.709
And cross whatever I have left
of this heart,

15:27.752 --> 15:30.886
I swear on my daughter's life
most of this is water.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.932
Yeah, that's what I thought.

15:32.975 --> 15:35.108
You recognize anyone?

15:35.151 --> 15:36.631
Not yet.

15:36.674 --> 15:38.198
Just wedding planners,

15:38.241 --> 15:39.547
tourists and florists.

15:39.590 --> 15:41.549
Well, then I think we
should do our very best

15:41.592 --> 15:43.290
to make ourselves
at home. Ooh.

15:43.333 --> 15:44.856
Are these baked inMm-hmm.

15:46.032 --> 15:48.643
"Baked in-house."

15:48.686 --> 15:49.861
Huh.

15:53.126 --> 15:54.823
Here's the...Uh-huh.

15:54.866 --> 15:57.304
Uh, how long has the problem
been going on?

15:59.306 --> 16:02.048
I'm sorry. Uh, what did you ask?

16:02.091 --> 16:04.441
Um, when did the problem start?

16:04.485 --> 16:07.836
Okay.
Um, let me think.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.838
So, everything was fine this
morning when the markets opened.

16:09.881 --> 16:12.275
And then the servers
started slowing down

16:12.319 --> 16:14.669
sometime around 9:00.

16:14.712 --> 16:16.671
ERIC: Hmm. That's exactly
what I thought.

16:16.714 --> 16:18.716
The whole building is affected.

16:18.760 --> 16:21.676
I'm gonna have to install
the new security protocols

16:21.719 --> 16:23.112
office by office.

16:23.156 --> 16:25.027
Okay, so how long
will this take?

16:25.071 --> 16:28.030
You won't even know I'm here.

16:28.074 --> 16:31.294
Oh, um, can I get you anything?
Coffee?

16:31.338 --> 16:33.644
Thank you, but, no, I'm not
allowed to have caffeine.

16:34.776 --> 16:36.038
Uh, strict orders.

16:36.082 --> 16:37.866
Okay.

16:37.909 --> 16:40.042
All right, um,
I'll leave you to it.

16:43.524 --> 16:44.873
Okay, Nell, I'm in.

16:44.916 --> 16:45.874
NELL:
Great.

16:45.917 --> 16:47.702
How does Leigha Winters seem?

16:47.745 --> 16:48.703
Not good.

16:48.746 --> 16:51.793
She's distracted, concerned.

16:51.836 --> 16:53.795
All right, let's look
at her bank's equity trades.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.710
Have they made
another mirror trade for Sokolov

16:55.753 --> 16:57.451
or one of his shell companies?

16:57.494 --> 16:59.801
I don't see anything
that resembles a mirror trade

16:59.844 --> 17:01.455
since the last time
Sokolov was in town.

17:01.498 --> 17:02.934
And, um...

17:02.978 --> 17:04.762
yeah, no new activity
in Sokolov's accounts either.

17:04.806 --> 17:06.242
Damn it.

17:06.286 --> 17:08.070
Maybe he hasn't reached out
to her yet.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.898
Or maybe
he's being extra cautious

17:09.941 --> 17:11.726
after what happened last time.

17:11.769 --> 17:13.945
Or maybe Sokolov is
pulling a changeup.

17:13.989 --> 17:15.599
Last time,
he exchanged his money first

17:15.643 --> 17:17.166
and then went for the weapons.

17:17.210 --> 17:19.429
Maybe this time, he's doing
the whole thing in reverse.

17:19.473 --> 17:21.649
Yeah. He's trying to get his
hands on whatever it is he wants

17:21.692 --> 17:23.433
and then worrying about
how to pay for it later.

17:23.477 --> 17:24.695
Exactly.

17:24.739 --> 17:26.871
Which could make Leigha Winters
expendable.

17:26.915 --> 17:29.091
If she thinks
she's having a bad day now...

17:29.135 --> 17:30.919
It's about to get a lot worse.

17:30.962 --> 17:32.355
I'll call Callen.

17:32.399 --> 17:34.705
You and Hidoko guard
Leigha Winters with your lives

17:34.749 --> 17:35.880
until the cavalry arrives.

17:35.924 --> 17:38.492
Copy that.

17:39.841 --> 17:40.798
Thanks.

17:40.842 --> 17:42.191
That was Nell.

17:42.235 --> 17:43.714
ARKADY:
Yeah, listen, I've been meaning

17:43.758 --> 17:45.890
to ask you serious question.

17:45.934 --> 17:49.111
Is she natural redhead?

17:49.155 --> 17:52.158
Bank hasn't made
any mirror trades

17:52.201 --> 17:53.985
or any trades of any other kind
for Sokolov

17:54.029 --> 17:55.726
since the last time
he was in town.

17:55.770 --> 17:57.685
Yeah, he knew better
than to go back.

17:57.728 --> 17:59.643
Or whatever the real reason is
he's in L.A.,

17:59.687 --> 18:01.254
he doesn't need dollars
to pay for it.

18:07.695 --> 18:09.871
G, 12 o'clock.

18:12.787 --> 18:13.875
Recognize him?

18:13.918 --> 18:15.050
SAM:
No, but he's definitely

18:15.094 --> 18:16.573
not a tourist or a florist.

18:17.618 --> 18:19.837
I see what you mean.

18:20.925 --> 18:22.275

21:03.523 --> 21:05.438
I doubt it has anything
to do with NCIS.

21:06.569 --> 21:08.354
You guys are looking for
Abram Sokolov, aren't you?

21:08.397 --> 21:09.616
:
Oh, snap.

21:09.659 --> 21:11.357
You guys are good.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.098
ANNA: Wait, what
are you saying?

21:14.142 --> 21:16.623
Callen, are we working
the same case?

21:16.666 --> 21:18.886
It sounds like we are.

21:25.588 --> 21:27.808
Hi.

21:27.851 --> 21:30.027
Hi.

21:30.071 --> 21:32.856
I wanted to talk
with you about...

21:32.900 --> 21:37.339
Mr. Beale is most definitely
up to the task.

21:37.383 --> 21:39.167
I, um...

21:39.210 --> 21:40.951
I read his file,
Henrietta.

21:40.995 --> 21:42.866
It's thin.

21:42.910 --> 21:45.826
As was yours at one point.
As was mine.

21:45.869 --> 21:47.610
Very true statements.

21:47.654 --> 21:49.264
I'm just wondering,
how do you know

21:49.308 --> 21:51.440
when someone like Eric is ready?

21:51.484 --> 21:53.094
Oh.

21:53.137 --> 21:55.357
:
I suppose Mr. Beale

21:55.401 --> 21:58.926
is a bit of an outlier,
I mean, compared

21:58.969 --> 22:00.362
to the others.

22:00.406 --> 22:01.668
You think?

22:01.711 --> 22:05.019
But make no mistake,
he's just as important.

22:05.062 --> 22:06.629
You leave one ingredient

22:06.673 --> 22:10.154
out of a recipe,
and the entire cake crumbles.

22:10.198 --> 22:13.506
And exactly which ingredient
is Eric?

22:13.549 --> 22:16.117
Depends on the day.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.510
Ah.

22:17.553 --> 22:18.815
ANNA:
Last week,

22:18.859 --> 22:21.427
someone stole $3 million worth
of whiskey

22:21.470 --> 22:23.777
and cigarettes from
the Port of Los Angeles.

22:23.820 --> 22:26.214
Now, we don't know where
the product went, but...

22:26.257 --> 22:28.608
But you honed in
on Abram Sokolov.

22:28.651 --> 22:29.957
ANNA: We think
he's the buyer.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.524
He not only has
the resources,

22:31.567 --> 22:33.874
he also has multiple
business associates...

22:33.917 --> 22:35.266
Which is a polite term,
let me tell you.

22:35.310 --> 22:36.833
We know, Gary.

22:36.877 --> 22:40.271
...tied to alcohol and
tobacco distributors.

22:40.315 --> 22:42.056
CALLEN: So Sokolov is
not here for weapons.

22:42.099 --> 22:43.362
He's here for cigarettes?

22:43.405 --> 22:44.972
ARKADY: In Ukraine,
American cigarettes

22:45.015 --> 22:47.061
are worth more
than American dollars.

22:47.104 --> 22:48.497
He can turn
the smokes into cash,

22:48.541 --> 22:50.281
and the cash into
whatever the hell he wants.

22:50.325 --> 22:52.893
And whatever Sokolov wants
can't be good.

22:52.936 --> 22:54.634
He's still gonna have to pay
for the alcohol and the tobacco.

22:54.677 --> 22:55.852
I don't care how many business
associates he's got,

22:55.896 --> 22:57.332
they're not gonna accept rubles.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.073
Well, if he's not using
Leigha Winters' bank,

22:59.116 --> 23:01.292
then he has to find
a new source of cash.

23:01.336 --> 23:02.729
Enough with
the conspiracy theories.

23:02.772 --> 23:03.991
What are we doing

23:04.034 --> 23:05.340
to help Vladlena?

23:05.384 --> 23:07.037
CALLEN: We're doing
everything we can.

23:07.081 --> 23:08.169
First, we need
to have Eric

23:08.212 --> 23:09.562
warn Leigha Winters.

23:09.605 --> 23:11.128
We'll let you know
if we find anything.

23:11.172 --> 23:12.608
Yeah. Likewise.

23:12.652 --> 23:13.870
Hey, nice meeting you guys.

23:15.219 --> 23:16.960
Yeah.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.704
Gary.

23:26.187 --> 23:27.406
Hey, have you seen Leigha?

23:27.449 --> 23:28.885
What up, bro?
Hey.

23:28.929 --> 23:29.930
Dude.

23:29.973 --> 23:31.453
Nice chinos.

23:31.497 --> 23:33.542
Are you here for the HR job?VICTOR: Berkeley.

23:33.586 --> 23:35.588
Have you found any link
to Berkeley?

23:35.631 --> 23:36.980
Those Bo

23:37.024 --> 23:38.939
It's actually pronounced
Bonobos.

23:38.982 --> 23:41.376
Because you seem very balanced.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.682
You know, chemically.
Please tell me

23:42.725 --> 23:43.639
you're here for the HR job.

23:43.683 --> 23:45.598
Where is Leigha?!Uh, okay.

23:45.641 --> 23:47.121
Why don't you just check
her office?

23:47.164 --> 23:48.078
And don't yell at me!

23:48.122 --> 23:50.341
She's usually in her office.

23:50.385 --> 23:51.995
Yeah. She used to come
to lunch with us,

23:52.039 --> 23:53.606
and now she pretty much
just hangs out in her office.

23:53.649 --> 23:55.608
I checked her office, already!
I cannot find her anywhere!

23:55.651 --> 23:58.219
Hidoko, I've lost Leigha.

23:58.262 --> 24:00.177
I'm sorry.
I have no idea where she went.

24:00.221 --> 24:02.702
Eric, relax.
She just stepped outside.

24:07.707 --> 24:09.839
Thank you.It's what I'm here for.

24:09.883 --> 24:11.928
One of the things I'm here for.

24:12.973 --> 24:15.236
Ms. Winters?

24:15.279 --> 24:18.239
Oh. Um, how's it
going up there?

24:18.282 --> 24:19.196
Uh, problem solved.

24:19.240 --> 24:20.981
Because you never
actually had

24:21.024 --> 24:23.505
an I.T. issue
to begin with.

24:23.549 --> 24:26.552
Um, the server slowdown this
morning was fabricated by me,

24:26.595 --> 24:28.641
so that I could have a reason
to come to your office.

24:28.684 --> 24:30.643
This is all a very long way
of saying

24:30.686 --> 24:32.819
that I'm with NCIS.

24:32.862 --> 24:36.475
Oh. Uh, you work
with Agent Callen?
I do.

24:36.518 --> 24:38.912
He-he promised you guys
would look out for me

24:38.955 --> 24:40.653
if and when
Sokolov figured out

24:40.696 --> 24:43.482
I was helping NCIS.

24:43.525 --> 24:44.961
Wait a minute.

24:45.005 --> 24:47.529
That means Sokolov is back,
doesn't it?

24:47.573 --> 24:51.620
Um, we actually can't confirm
that yet, but maybe.

24:51.664 --> 24:52.578
That's why I'm here.

24:52.621 --> 24:53.579
And-and, also, that's why

24:53.622 --> 24:55.798
Special Agent Hidoko
is also here.

24:55.842 --> 24:58.888
Two more NCIS agents
will be here any minute

24:58.932 --> 25:00.629
to bring you to our boatshed,

25:00.673 --> 25:02.631
bring you into
protective custody,

25:02.675 --> 25:04.154
just to be safe.

25:04.198 --> 25:06.635
Yeah. I thought
all this was behind me.

25:06.679 --> 25:10.639
Not yet.
But we're working on it.

25:12.554 --> 25:14.251
Who you think
he's talking to?

25:14.295 --> 25:17.080
Probably someone we don't
want to know about.

25:17.124 --> 25:18.995
What?

25:20.344 --> 25:24.087
Anna and I have not seen
a lot of each other lately.

25:24.131 --> 25:25.872
Okay? We've been busy.

25:25.915 --> 25:27.526
She's got a new gig at the ATF.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.745
And Glendale, where she works,Hmm.

25:29.789 --> 25:31.094
might as well be Nevada.

25:31.138 --> 25:33.967
G, you think everything
east of La Brea is Nevada.

25:34.010 --> 25:36.012
My point exactly.
Mm.

25:38.058 --> 25:39.625
We meet again.

25:39.668 --> 25:41.670
Agents Blye and Deeks
brought you up to speed?

25:41.714 --> 25:42.758
Yeah, unfortunately.

25:42.802 --> 25:44.586
How you holding up?

25:44.630 --> 25:46.370
Honestly, I have no idea.

25:46.414 --> 25:48.764
Okay, well, you're safe now.
Make yourself at home.

25:48.808 --> 25:50.810
Okay. Thanks.Thanks.

25:55.162 --> 25:57.599
You find anything
at Vladlena's?

25:57.643 --> 25:59.906
Unfortunately, nothing that
may tell us where she is now.

25:59.949 --> 26:01.560
DEEKS: We went to
her poker place

26:01.603 --> 26:04.127
and she hasn't been back since
yesterday and her driver's MIA.

26:04.171 --> 26:05.041
Well, that's not good.

26:05.085 --> 26:06.695
Mm.

26:06.739 --> 26:09.611
Feel free to leave
whenever you want, Arkady.

26:09.655 --> 26:11.439
We have plenty of agents
working this.

26:11.482 --> 26:12.571
Stop trying to get rid of me.

26:12.614 --> 26:13.876
I'm not leaving
till we find Vladlena.

26:13.920 --> 26:16.400
She may have
helped you guys,

26:16.444 --> 26:18.620
but I'm the reason
she got dragged into this mess.

26:18.664 --> 26:21.405
So you do have a heart
in there after all.

26:21.449 --> 26:22.798
Somewhere.

26:22.842 --> 26:26.019
Don't tell anyone.
I've got reputation to protect.

26:26.062 --> 26:27.150
So, this phone call

26:27.194 --> 26:28.630
was with my barber.

26:28.674 --> 26:30.240
He has client
whose sister is

26:30.284 --> 26:31.720
very talented psychic.

26:31.764 --> 26:34.549
She sees all Kardashians,
except Khloe, my favorite.

26:34.593 --> 26:35.898
Anyway, this psychic

26:35.942 --> 26:37.813
has other client
that sees Sokolov

26:37.857 --> 26:41.382
this morning in L.A.,
coming out after massage.

26:41.425 --> 26:45.647
I'm sorry. We're supposed
to treat this as a real lead?

26:45.691 --> 26:47.040
Call me Spider.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.868
Oh, but I'm not eunuch.

26:48.911 --> 26:50.217
That makes me
feel weird.

26:50.260 --> 26:51.914
CALLEN:
We'll check out the spa,

26:51.958 --> 26:53.960
or whatever
this place is.

26:54.003 --> 26:55.135
Keep her safe.

26:55.178 --> 26:56.310
And keep him
out of trouble.

26:56.353 --> 26:57.659
The Spider?

26:57.703 --> 26:58.660
We'll try.

26:58.704 --> 27:00.619
Eunuch, yeesh.

27:06.842 --> 27:09.018
SAM: How did Sokolov get
a massage here this morning?

27:09.062 --> 27:10.803
Place is closed.

27:10.846 --> 27:12.631
Why do we even
listen to Arkady?

27:12.674 --> 27:14.415
What other choice
do we have?

27:14.458 --> 27:17.026
Here they are.

27:21.291 --> 27:23.859
Hey.

27:23.903 --> 27:25.644
Thanks for including us.

27:25.687 --> 27:26.862
Yeah. No problem.

27:26.906 --> 27:29.473
SAM: You know, why
don't you and Anna

27:29.517 --> 27:31.737
take the front;
me and Gary will take the back.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.216
CALLEN:
All right.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.697
SAM:
Come on, Gary.

27:35.741 --> 27:38.961
Let's go.

27:39.005 --> 27:40.702
CALLEN:
So, uh...

27:40.746 --> 27:43.052
what's Gary's story?

27:43.096 --> 27:44.532
His story?

27:44.575 --> 27:47.578
Yeah. Is he ex
Is he former law enforcement?

27:47.622 --> 27:50.581
Maybe spent some time
as a game show host?

27:50.625 --> 27:53.584
What? If you're gonna have a
partner, I got to make sure

27:53.628 --> 27:55.848
that he's up to the task
of having your back.

27:55.891 --> 27:58.981
Mm-hmm. Gary's solid.

28:02.463 --> 28:04.334
Just say it.

28:04.378 --> 28:05.466
What?

28:08.774 --> 28:11.690
It's been a while
since we have...

28:12.560 --> 28:13.735
...hung out.

28:13.779 --> 28:15.606
I know.

28:15.650 --> 28:19.698
It's just that work
and Glendale and Gary.

28:21.438 --> 28:23.789
Don't read too much
into it, okay?

28:25.486 --> 28:28.358
If you tell me not to, I won't.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.363
In position.

28:33.407 --> 28:35.017
Sam, this door is open.

28:35.061 --> 28:36.932
This one is, too.

28:36.976 --> 28:38.760
All right, let's go
on my count.

28:38.804 --> 28:40.936
One, two, three.

28:50.424 --> 28:51.904
Clear.
Clear.

28:51.947 --> 28:53.166
GARY :
Clear.

28:53.209 --> 28:55.168
Clear.

29:06.092 --> 29:07.093
CALLEN:
Clear.

29:07.136 --> 29:10.052
Clear.

29:13.273 --> 29:15.275
Clear.

29:23.587 --> 29:25.154
Oh, my God!

29:25.198 --> 29:26.677
Vladlena!

29:43.346 --> 29:45.044
Ambulance is on its way.

29:45.087 --> 29:47.786
My brother, the sick,
sick man.

29:47.829 --> 29:50.049
ANNA:
You're safe now.

29:50.092 --> 29:52.529
And very lucky
your brother didn't kill you.

29:52.573 --> 29:54.618
VLADLENA: I don't
think he was planning

29:54.662 --> 29:57.404
on anyone finding me here.

29:59.275 --> 30:02.365
I have to apologize.

30:02.409 --> 30:04.454
CALLEN: No, you don't.
You don't have to apologize

30:04.498 --> 30:05.847
for the horrible things
your brother did.

30:05.891 --> 30:08.458
No, it's not that.

30:08.502 --> 30:11.940
Abram, he broke me.

30:11.984 --> 30:13.942
I told him everything.

30:13.986 --> 30:16.336
He knows it was you

30:16.379 --> 30:18.294
who ruined his
money laundering operation.

30:18.338 --> 30:20.166
And he knows

30:20.209 --> 30:21.732
Leigha Winters helped you.

30:23.778 --> 30:25.954
I'm sorry.
No.

30:30.306 --> 30:32.787
MOSLEY:
So...

30:32.831 --> 30:35.746
I just received a call
from L.A.'s ATF

30:35.790 --> 30:38.010
thanking me
for the hot tip.

30:38.053 --> 30:40.142
I was... I was just
coming to tell you.

30:40.186 --> 30:42.188
Though, I figured
if we could

30:42.231 --> 30:44.016
find the missing cigarettes
and alcohol,

30:44.059 --> 30:46.409
we could probably find
the missing Sokolov,

30:46.453 --> 30:49.543
who, might I add, would need
a sizeable storage facility

30:49.586 --> 30:52.024
to make that much product
disappear into thin air.

30:52.067 --> 30:54.678
So I conducted a search,
and I found a warehouse

30:54.722 --> 30:57.159
just a couple miles outside
of the Port of Los Angeles

30:57.203 --> 31:00.162
that hasn't had any activity
for months until, of course,

31:00.206 --> 31:02.251
the day the product was stolen.

31:02.295 --> 31:03.949
Now, Kensi and Deeks,

31:03.992 --> 31:05.515
they're stuck at the boatshed
with Leigha Winters,

31:05.559 --> 31:07.996
and Callen and Sam are
at the spa with Vladlena.

31:08.040 --> 31:10.346
And ATF had a team
on the ground near the port,

31:10.390 --> 31:12.435
so I called them.

31:12.479 --> 31:14.133
Nice work.

31:14.176 --> 31:16.178
Let me know
what they say.

31:16.222 --> 31:18.224
Will do.

31:20.313 --> 31:22.184
Whew!

31:28.364 --> 31:30.323
Vladlena, I am here!

31:30.366 --> 31:32.455
ANNA: Our agents just
raided a warehouse

31:32.499 --> 31:34.109
Nell tipped us to by the port.

31:34.153 --> 31:35.154
They find anything?

31:35.197 --> 31:37.547
Nothing but empty
sunscreen boxes.

31:37.591 --> 31:40.072
Do you have a picture
of those boxes?

31:43.162 --> 31:45.338
The alcohol and
tobacco was there.

31:45.381 --> 31:46.774
So was Sokolov.

31:46.817 --> 31:48.428
It's the same packaging
he used last time

31:48.471 --> 31:49.777
he tried to
launder his money.

31:49.820 --> 31:51.300
Which means we're too late.

31:51.344 --> 31:52.998
Sokolov already has
everything he wants.

31:53.041 --> 31:55.000
Not everything.

31:55.043 --> 31:56.088
Leigha Winters.

31:56.131 --> 31:57.393
Where is she?

31:57.437 --> 31:59.395
In our protective custody.

31:59.439 --> 32:01.223
Can we speak to her?

32:02.659 --> 32:04.270
Sure.

32:05.967 --> 32:08.578
I'm going to go to hospital
with Vladlena, okay?

32:08.622 --> 32:10.015
Of course you are.

32:10.058 --> 32:12.800
And thank you,
for everything.

32:14.802 --> 32:16.935
Give me a moment.

32:19.024 --> 32:20.416
What?

32:20.460 --> 32:23.985
I'm seeing a whole new side,
and I must say,

32:24.029 --> 32:26.031
it's not completely
disappointing.

32:26.074 --> 32:29.948
Anna, you're
too young to be going soft.

32:29.991 --> 32:31.906
Go.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.083
Go.

32:45.964 --> 32:46.965
ARKADY:
Watch it!

32:47.008 --> 32:48.531
We have precious cargo
back here.

32:53.188 --> 32:55.016
You're not talking
about me, are you?

32:57.888 --> 32:59.629
Oh, God.

33:00.891 --> 33:03.851
Surprise.

33:03.894 --> 33:06.897
Guys, ATF Agents
Kolcheck and Baker.

33:06.941 --> 33:08.334
This is Leigha Winters.

33:08.377 --> 33:10.945
They have a couple questions
they'd like to ask you.

33:12.686 --> 33:14.557
It's Arkady. Here.

33:14.601 --> 33:16.037
He's your friend.

33:16.081 --> 33:17.473
Mm, he's your dad.

33:18.953 --> 33:20.737
Hello?

33:20.781 --> 33:22.348
Who is this?

33:25.133 --> 33:26.917
Where's my father?

33:29.094 --> 33:30.921
I-I don't know a Leigha Winters

33:30.965 --> 33:32.271
or even where
to find her.

33:32.314 --> 33:35.056
Nell, trace the number
calling Anna's cell.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.753
ANNA:
Okay.

33:36.797 --> 33:39.017
Okay, listen to me.
I'm gonna need more time.

33:39.060 --> 33:40.888
Hello?

33:40.931 --> 33:42.020
Hello?

33:43.630 --> 33:45.240
He hung up.

33:45.284 --> 33:46.937
Scratch that.

33:46.981 --> 33:48.765
What's going on?

33:48.809 --> 33:50.767
That was Sokolov.
He has Arkady.

33:50.811 --> 33:52.465
Must have jacked
the ambulance.

33:52.508 --> 33:53.770
What does Sokolov want?

33:53.814 --> 33:56.208
He wants to exchange him
for her.

33:57.948 --> 33:59.602
Wh...KENSI: It's okay.
It's all right.

33:59.646 --> 34:01.082
When and where?

34:01.126 --> 34:03.563
Hollywood Forever Cemetery.
30 minutes.

34:05.130 --> 34:07.045
At least we know
where he's gonna be.

34:17.533 --> 34:19.535
♪

34:26.542 --> 34:28.544
Any sign of Sokolov?

34:28.718 --> 34:30.068
Not here.

34:32.331 --> 34:33.680
Or here.

34:33.723 --> 34:35.725
I got nothing.

34:37.118 --> 34:38.685
Me neither.

34:42.341 --> 34:44.952
This doesn't feel right, G.

34:44.995 --> 34:47.172
DEEKS: I'm with Sam.
You don't schedule a meet

34:47.215 --> 34:50.349
and then show up late,
even in L.A. traffic.

34:50.392 --> 34:52.307
Maybe they made us
and spooked.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.876
Maybe he was never coming.

34:55.919 --> 34:58.574
He doesn't need Leigha.

34:58.618 --> 35:00.620
He only needs her bank's money.

35:02.883 --> 35:04.928
We're on Leigha.

35:08.671 --> 35:10.108
Hello?

35:10.151 --> 35:12.066
CALLEN: Eric, I need you
to get everyone out of there.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.415
What What's going on?

35:13.459 --> 35:14.895
Sokolov may be headed your way.

35:14.938 --> 35:15.852
Leigha's not here, though.

35:15.896 --> 35:17.158
But the money is!

35:17.202 --> 35:18.725
Now, get those people
out of there now!

35:18.768 --> 35:19.726
Okay.

35:19.769 --> 35:22.424
All right, people, listen up!

35:22.468 --> 35:24.078
I'm gonna have to ask you

35:24.122 --> 35:26.428
to vacate your offices
immediately.

35:26.472 --> 35:27.995
Why?

35:28.038 --> 35:31.129
Uh, I can explain later,
but it's for your safety.

35:31.172 --> 35:34.784
Dude, we got
work to do.

35:34.828 --> 35:38.571
Uh, yeah, I'm actually not
the I.T. guy.

35:38.614 --> 35:40.486
I'm with NCIS.

35:40.529 --> 35:41.922
What is that?

35:41.965 --> 35:44.925
Uh, Naval Criminal
Investigative Service.

35:48.929 --> 35:50.931
Uh, it's a federal
law enforcement agency.

35:50.974 --> 35:52.933
Do you have a badge?

35:52.976 --> 35:54.978
No, I don't have a badge because
I'm working undercover right...

35:55.022 --> 35:56.545
I'm calling security.

35:56.589 --> 35:58.895
No, please don't call security.
I am your security. Hidoko!

35:58.939 --> 36:00.375
What is a Hidoko?

36:00.419 --> 36:03.552
I'm coming.

36:03.596 --> 36:05.641
ERIC:
Okay, people...Hey, let's go.

36:05.685 --> 36:08.253
No. No, no, no, sir,
I am not leaving the premises

36:08.296 --> 36:09.950
without everybody else.

36:09.993 --> 36:11.821
You don't even have the proper
work order to be here, pal.

36:11.865 --> 36:13.214
What? No...
WOMAN:
We should call the police.

36:13.258 --> 36:15.173
We don't know what
he's done with Leigha.

36:15.216 --> 36:16.565
That's right, man.
Come on, let's go.

36:16.609 --> 36:18.219
Everybody stand down.
I'm Special Agent Hidoko

36:18.263 --> 36:19.612
with NCIS,
and you need to clear

36:19.655 --> 36:21.091
these offices
immediately.

36:21.135 --> 36:22.615
I need you to help
evacuate everyone

36:22.658 --> 36:24.530
out of this building through
the nearest emergency exit.

36:24.573 --> 36:25.618
Now.
Okay.

36:25.661 --> 36:27.228
Okay, come on,
come on, everybody.

36:27.272 --> 36:29.012
Move!
Out of here.
Let's take the stairs.

36:29.056 --> 36:30.318
Use the stairs.
Let's go.Thank you.

36:30.362 --> 36:31.928
No worries.GUARD: Down the stairs, guys.

36:31.972 --> 36:33.713
HIDOKO:
Come on, quickly. Let's go.

36:33.756 --> 36:35.541
All right, thank you.

36:35.584 --> 36:37.064
All right, Eric,
we're good down here.

36:37.107 --> 36:38.108
ERIC:
Copy that.

36:44.376 --> 36:45.681
Hello.

36:49.468 --> 36:50.904
Chair.

36:53.080 --> 36:54.821
Sit.

36:57.650 --> 36:59.042
SOKOLOV :
Where is everybody?

36:59.086 --> 37:01.697
They went home.
Computer problems.

37:01.741 --> 37:04.483
So... who are you?

37:04.526 --> 37:06.485
I'm the I.T. guy.

37:06.528 --> 37:10.619
I.T. guy.
Left in bank alone.

37:10.663 --> 37:12.534
HIDOKO :
Be cool, Eric.

37:12.578 --> 37:13.796
I'm cool.

37:13.840 --> 37:16.625
He's cool. That's good.

37:16.669 --> 37:19.019
I'm cool, too.

37:19.062 --> 37:21.587
We're all cool.

37:23.676 --> 37:25.721
So, Mr. Cool...

37:28.594 --> 37:32.032
...I need you to help me
make a transfer.

37:33.860 --> 37:36.079
Callen, where are you?

37:36.123 --> 37:38.734
CALLEN:
We're two minutes out.

37:48.048 --> 37:49.571
Sit.

37:53.575 --> 37:55.969
$30 million.

37:56.012 --> 37:58.667
Wire now.

37:58.711 --> 38:00.452
ERIC:
Um, like I said before,

38:00.495 --> 38:02.671
I'm the I.T. guy.
I-I'm just the I.T. guy,

38:02.715 --> 38:05.544
so I don't know how to...
Just the IT guy.

38:05.587 --> 38:07.285
Mm-hmm.

38:07.328 --> 38:11.158
You're smart enough
to fix computers.

38:11.201 --> 38:15.336
Therefore, you're smart enough
to add zeroes to my account.

38:20.820 --> 38:22.822
It's possible.

38:36.357 --> 38:37.489
We're headed in.

38:41.971 --> 38:43.930
Everyone from
the bank gone?

38:43.973 --> 38:45.932
It's just Eric,
Sokolov and his men.

38:45.975 --> 38:47.847
I don't know how many.
I didn't see them enter.

38:47.890 --> 38:49.892
It sounds like a fair fight.
Let's go.

39:16.179 --> 39:17.703
Cover me.

39:25.798 --> 39:28.714
♪

39:52.781 --> 39:55.088
♪

40:00.746 --> 40:03.792
Sokolov! Put your hands up.

40:06.273 --> 40:08.710
Now, very slowly,

40:08.754 --> 40:11.147
drop to your knees.

40:11.191 --> 40:13.933
If you say so.

40:13.976 --> 40:17.023
But I will still
kill you all.

40:17.066 --> 40:19.678
On your knees! Now!

40:26.946 --> 40:28.600
Anna.

40:31.733 --> 40:34.606
Anna, you okay?

40:47.923 --> 40:49.185
Anna?

40:51.840 --> 40:54.103
Where's his gun?

40:59.195 --> 41:00.936
Anna, what happened?

41:10.163 --> 41:12.295
Hey, good job getting
those people out of there.

41:12.339 --> 41:13.645
That was Hidoko.

41:13.688 --> 41:15.385
He stayed behind
to keep Sokolov busy.

41:15.908 --> 41:16.865
That takes guts.

41:16.909 --> 41:18.650
Bulletproof Beale.

41:20.869 --> 41:23.350
Hey.
Oh.

41:23.393 --> 41:24.917
Where'd you find him?

41:24.960 --> 41:27.354
Well, the ambulance was found
ditched in a parking lot.

41:27.397 --> 41:28.703
This guy was in the back.

41:28.747 --> 41:30.226
Vladlena's on her way
to the hospital.

41:30.270 --> 41:33.012
The EMT's were shaken,
thankfully unharmed.

41:33.055 --> 41:35.231
I never thought I'd be
happy to see you, Arkady.

41:35.275 --> 41:38.365
Everyone comes around.

41:38.408 --> 41:39.540
Eventually.

41:39.584 --> 41:41.194
Is that right?

41:41.237 --> 41:43.283
And you, how are you?

41:43.326 --> 41:46.547
I'm, um... cool.

41:46.591 --> 41:47.548
Yeah.

41:47.592 --> 41:49.071
You are cool.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.251
ARKADY:
Anna.

41:56.688 --> 41:58.690
Anna?

42:03.433 --> 42:05.653
Anna

42:05.697 --> 42:07.742
Where's Sokolov?
He get away?

42:10.397 --> 42:11.746
No.

42:11.790 --> 42:13.922
Anna got him.
