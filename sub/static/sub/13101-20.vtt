[instrumental music]

00:36.083 --> 00:38.083
Marcus.

00:39.833 --> 00:41.250
'Marcus.'

00:43.125 --> 00:45.042
The transport has arrived.

00:50.542 --> 00:54.500
[sighs]
We have to send her back
to Babylon 5.

00:54.583 --> 00:56.208
It's dangerous to keep her here.

00:56.292 --> 00:57.792
We're almost at Mars.

00:59.042 --> 01:00.958
She would want to be here
for the battle

01:01.042 --> 01:02.958
conscious or otherwise.

01:03.583 --> 01:04.792
I know..

01:04.875 --> 01:07.417
...but we must do
what's best for her.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.167
She's dying.

01:09.250 --> 01:10.750
What is there to do?

01:12.208 --> 01:14.708
Make her comfortable,
in her last hours.

01:15.625 --> 01:17.083
'We cannot do that here.'

01:17.167 --> 01:19.958
'On Babylon 5, they will see
to all her needs..'

01:22.083 --> 01:23.833
...as long as she has them.

01:23.917 --> 01:27.000

(Franklin)
November 1st, 2261.

02:32.958 --> 02:34.417
Doctor's personal log.

02:35.917 --> 02:38.125
We're ready.

02:38.208 --> 02:41.083
We're starting the final strike
to free Earth and Mars.

02:42.333 --> 02:43.875
I don't know
if this is gonna work

02:43.958 --> 02:47.750
but it's gonna be
one hell of a fight either way.

02:47.833 --> 02:50.250
[indistinct chatter]

02:51.750 --> 02:52.917
(male #1)
'You got us checked out?'

02:53.000 --> 02:54.333
(male #2)
'Yeah, we're all set.'

03:01.750 --> 03:02.917
- What do you got?
- Ten just came through.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.042
We got 20 more to check out.

03:04.125 --> 03:05.917
It's more than we got time..

03:06.000 --> 03:07.917
This is Kelley,
our contact at the staging area.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.417
It's good to meet you, now,
you're sure that you can smuggle

03:10.500 --> 03:12.583
all these units
on board the Destroyer?

03:12.667 --> 03:13.833
I guess.

03:13.917 --> 03:14.958
Don't guess.

03:15.042 --> 03:17.708
It's just...not what I expected.

03:17.792 --> 03:19.208
I figured you wanted me
to smuggle on

03:19.292 --> 03:20.958
weapons or bombs not people.

03:21.042 --> 03:22.292
No, no, no.

03:22.375 --> 03:24.042
They'd pick up weapons
in a minute, alright?

03:24.125 --> 03:25.333
Just get 'em past
the bio-scanners.

03:25.417 --> 03:26.417
Everything will be alright.

03:26.500 --> 03:27.917
I'll see to it.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.667
I just can't figure out
what one of these

03:29.750 --> 03:31.583
is gonna do against
an entire Destroyer.

03:31.667 --> 03:33.333
That's our problem, not yours.

03:33.417 --> 03:34.333
Just remember

03:34.417 --> 03:36.292
one unit per ship, no more.

03:36.375 --> 03:37.500
That's 30 ships total.

03:37.583 --> 03:39.667
That's almost the entire fleet.

03:39.750 --> 03:41.000
It's gonna be tricky.

03:41.083 --> 03:42.292
The Destroyers never lands.

03:42.375 --> 03:43.792
So we'll have to shuttle them up
one at a time

03:43.875 --> 03:45.125
on their last supply run.

03:45.208 --> 03:46.417
Then you better get going.

03:46.500 --> 03:47.958
We're loading up the cryo units
in the back.

03:48.042 --> 03:50.708
Just tell my people where
and how you want them delivered.

03:54.917 --> 03:56.333
I really hope you know
what you're doing.

03:56.417 --> 03:58.375
We're only gonna get
one shot at this.

04:01.292 --> 04:03.792
It'll work. Where's Garibaldi?

04:03.875 --> 04:05.917
He's scouting out
the secondary target.

04:06.708 --> 04:09.792

04:43.083 --> 04:44.708
[groans]

04:47.917 --> 04:50.375
Piece of cake?

04:50.458 --> 04:52.333
Now, this is Grumpy to Sleepy,
Sneezy and Doc.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.667
We are in position,
moving in on foot.

04:54.750 --> 04:58.000
Which give us about, uh,
two hours, then make your move.

04:58.542 --> 05:00.125
Ready?

05:00.208 --> 05:01.708
Let's give 'em hell.

05:03.125 --> 05:06.167

05:47.875 --> 05:49.875
(Lennier)
It was the year of fire..

05:49.958 --> 05:51.667
(Zack)
The year of destruction..

05:51.750 --> 05:54.583
(G'Kar)
The year we took back
what was ours.

05:54.667 --> 05:56.583
(Lyta)
It was the year of rebirth..

05:56.667 --> 05:58.833
(Vir)
The year of great sadness..

05:58.917 --> 06:00.458
(Marcus)
The year of pain..

06:00.542 --> 06:01.833
(Delenn)
And the year of joy.

06:01.917 --> 06:04.167
(Londo)
It was a new age.

06:04.250 --> 06:05.875
(Franklin)
It was the end of history.

06:05.958 --> 06:07.042
(Ivanova)
It was the year

06:07.125 --> 06:08.833
everything changed.

06:11.333 --> 06:14.000
(Garibaldi)
The year is 2261.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.125
The place..

06:15.208 --> 06:17.583
(Sheridan)
'Babylon 5.'

06:17.667 --> 06:20.708
[theme music]

06:50.667 --> 06:53.708
[music continues]

07:18.375 --> 07:21.417
[whooshing]

07:23.458 --> 07:25.917
- Anything on the perimeter?
- 'Negative, sir.'

07:26.000 --> 07:28.208
Keep scanning, intel says
Sheridan's gonna make his move

07:28.292 --> 07:30.333
soon and the resistance
might try to take advantage

07:30.417 --> 07:31.417
of the confusion.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.667
Yes, sir.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.417
I wish I were up there.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.667
This is gonna be the biggest
gathering of Earth warships

07:37.750 --> 07:39.667
since the battle of the line.

07:39.750 --> 07:42.958
Sheridan doesn't stand a chance.

07:43.042 --> 07:45.208
Ground Station Alpha
to Ground Station Bravo.

07:45.292 --> 07:46.542
What's your status?

07:49.958 --> 07:52.250
Ground Station Bravo, report.

07:53.958 --> 07:55.375
What's wrong with GS Bravo?

07:55.458 --> 07:56.958
Same thing that's wrong here.

07:58.833 --> 08:00.208
[grunting]

08:03.458 --> 08:05.042
(female #1)
'Hands behind your back!'

08:05.125 --> 08:07.833
Hands behind your back,
or we let you suffocate.

08:08.958 --> 08:10.042
- Okay.
- Let's go.

08:10.125 --> 08:11.208
Okay.

08:11.292 --> 08:13.833
Good. Get 'em out of here. Move.

08:13.917 --> 08:15.208
(male #3)
Go, go.

08:15.292 --> 08:16.375
(Garibaldi)
Alright, get the airlock doors

08:16.458 --> 08:17.542
sealed and pressurized.

08:17.625 --> 08:20.375
[hissing]

08:22.292 --> 08:23.917
Did he get a chance
to warn the base?

08:24.000 --> 08:25.833
(female #1)
'Negative, assuming your people
were able to take'

08:25.917 --> 08:27.917
the rest of the bunkers
as efficiently as this one.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.417
You now control the perimeter.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.500
Excellent. Are we clear?

08:32.583 --> 08:33.833
We're clear.

08:33.917 --> 08:35.458
Alright, we can take 'em off.

08:39.292 --> 08:40.750
[exhales deeply]

08:45.125 --> 08:47.083
(Garibaldi)
'We got any more shuttles
leaving on the supply run?'

08:47.167 --> 08:48.333
Negative. That's the last batch.

08:48.417 --> 08:49.542
They'll drop their cargos

08:49.625 --> 08:51.125
with the Destroyers
in 45 minutes.

08:51.208 --> 08:52.125
Alright.

08:52.208 --> 08:53.625
Make sure the outer door
is secure.

08:53.708 --> 08:55.167
Yes, sir.

08:59.333 --> 09:00.750
Doc, you better get moving.

09:00.833 --> 09:02.208
Yeah.

09:05.250 --> 09:08.292
[dramatic music]

09:21.167 --> 09:22.667
May I have your attention?

09:23.917 --> 09:24.958
Captain James tells me

09:25.042 --> 09:27.042
we've reached
the final staging area.

09:30.542 --> 09:32.958
We're one jump from more trouble

09:33.042 --> 09:36.083
than most of you have seen
during your years in Earthforce.

09:36.167 --> 09:38.792
And it is my supreme hope..

09:38.875 --> 09:40.208
...that in all
the years after this

09:40.292 --> 09:42.917
we may never see
a day like this again.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.708
- Man your stations.
- 'Yes, sir.'

09:44.792 --> 09:46.750
Open up a channel
for the rest of the fleet.

09:48.625 --> 09:50.000
Signal coming through.

09:54.667 --> 09:58.333
This is Captain John Sheridan
to attack fleet.

09:58.417 --> 10:00.125
'You all know
what we expect of you.'

10:02.875 --> 10:05.333
We can't hit Earth
until we have taken care of

10:05.417 --> 10:08.333
the bases on Mars first, or..

10:08.417 --> 10:10.708
...we risk exposing our flank
to the enemy

10:10.792 --> 10:13.500
and fighting a battle
on two fronts.

10:13.583 --> 10:15.958
'The White Star fleet
and the Earth Destroyers'

10:16.042 --> 10:17.333
'that have joined with us'

10:17.417 --> 10:19.292
'will lead the assault.'

10:19.375 --> 10:23.375
'The League ships will provide
tactical support and defense.'

10:23.458 --> 10:26.833
'They will not engage
unless fired upon.'

10:26.917 --> 10:28.083
'Now, with luck..'

10:28.167 --> 10:29.625
...their presence
alone may be enough

10:29.708 --> 10:31.958
to discourage the enemy.

10:32.042 --> 10:35.625
All ships will stand by until
the final attack order is given.

10:36.750 --> 10:38.250
Marcus, are you ready?

10:39.417 --> 10:40.792
Standing by.

10:40.875 --> 10:42.625
You're cleared for phase one
as soon as you get

10:42.708 --> 10:45.042
the go-ahead order
from Mr. Garibaldi.

10:45.125 --> 10:46.292
Understood.

10:52.875 --> 10:54.917
[indistinct chatter]

10:55.000 --> 10:57.125
The last of the supplies
are aboard, general.

10:57.208 --> 11:00.042
Good, captain.
Then we can proceed.

11:00.125 --> 11:01.667
Anything new
from the hyperspace probes?

11:01.750 --> 11:03.167
They've picked up something
in the last few minutes

11:03.250 --> 11:05.000
but they're having
a hard time getting a fix.

11:05.083 --> 11:06.208
Is it Sheridan?

11:06.292 --> 11:07.750
We can't be sure,
but it's possible.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.000
Do we go in after him?

11:09.083 --> 11:10.292
Negative.

11:10.375 --> 11:12.167
There hasn't been an engagement
in hyperspace yet

11:12.250 --> 11:14.875
that didn't turn into
a disaster for both sides.

11:14.958 --> 11:16.917
It's too volatile.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.917
He has to come out
sooner or later.

11:20.333 --> 11:21.667
Open up a channel
to the other ships.

11:21.750 --> 11:23.000
Yes, sir.

11:25.333 --> 11:27.917
General, permission to speak
frankly?

11:28.000 --> 11:29.208
Go on.

11:29.292 --> 11:30.667
I was wondering
why they sent you

11:30.750 --> 11:32.042
to take over this mission.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.250
I've led the Apollo in over half

11:33.333 --> 11:34.917
a dozen major engagements.
We've--

11:35.000 --> 11:36.792
It's nothing to do
with you, Charlie.

11:36.875 --> 11:38.125
Your record's spotless.

11:38.208 --> 11:39.292
You're a good captain

11:39.375 --> 11:40.875
and you'll make
a good general someday.

11:42.333 --> 11:44.250
No, they picked me because
I'm from the old school

11:44.333 --> 11:46.042
that says a soldier
doesn't take arms

11:46.125 --> 11:47.750
against his own government..

11:47.833 --> 11:50.333
...no matter how justified
you feel doing it.

11:50.417 --> 11:52.333
And because Sheridan
was one of my students

11:52.417 --> 11:54.125
back at the academy.

11:54.208 --> 11:56.083
'I taught him
everything he knows.'

11:56.167 --> 11:59.625
I know how he thinks.
I know how he fights.

11:59.708 --> 12:03.000
And to tell you the truth,
I've always admired him.

12:05.042 --> 12:07.625
And now I'm going to have
to kill him..

12:07.708 --> 12:09.000
...and his ship..

12:10.000 --> 12:11.458
...and everyone around him.

12:13.958 --> 12:16.625
It's a terrible day, Charlie.

12:16.708 --> 12:19.250
I wish to hell
I'd never lived to see it.

12:25.458 --> 12:26.833
[beeps]

12:26.917 --> 12:28.292
This is fleet command.

12:28.375 --> 12:32.000
General Robert Lefcourt
to Destroyer group.

12:32.083 --> 12:34.000
'We believe the enemy
is standing by in hyperspace'

12:34.083 --> 12:36.500
'awaiting final orders
to engage.'

12:36.583 --> 12:37.667
'Take position.'

12:39.042 --> 12:40.375
You've been given
a list of our ships

12:40.458 --> 12:42.333
that have defected
to their sides

12:42.417 --> 12:45.292
and their friend-or-foe systems
have been adjusted accordingly.

12:48.083 --> 12:50.125
If a ship is on that list..

12:50.208 --> 12:51.875
...you are authorized
to open fire on that ship

12:51.958 --> 12:55.000
or any support vessel,
alien or human.

12:55.083 --> 12:57.292
You are to forget that these
people were once friends

12:57.375 --> 13:00.042
associates, and fellow officers.

13:00.125 --> 13:02.375
They are targets
to be destroyed.

13:02.458 --> 13:04.792
Nothing more, nothing less.

13:05.750 --> 13:07.958
We are here to do a job.

13:08.042 --> 13:09.208
Let's do it..

13:11.083 --> 13:13.000
'...and God help all of us.'

13:18.125 --> 13:19.208
[whooshing]

13:25.875 --> 13:28.167
- Is it ready?
- Don't rush me.

13:28.250 --> 13:29.542
If we don't get these neural
connections just right

13:29.625 --> 13:31.042
it's not gonna work.

13:31.125 --> 13:32.333
Okay, I'll just tell the fleet
to go get some lunch.

13:32.417 --> 13:35.792
Hang out for a while.

13:35.875 --> 13:37.083
How's that?

13:37.167 --> 13:39.042
It's alright.

13:39.125 --> 13:41.042
I'll have to go outside, though.

13:41.125 --> 13:42.792
Not a chance. You'll be seen.

13:42.875 --> 13:45.542
I can't have any obstacles
between me and the targets.

13:45.625 --> 13:48.250
This is gonna be hard enough
as it is because it's so far.

13:50.500 --> 13:51.583
Alright, go.

13:52.583 --> 13:54.500
Lyta.

13:54.583 --> 13:55.792
Stay low, huh?

14:04.583 --> 14:06.000
Alright..

14:06.083 --> 14:07.625
...that ought to do it.

14:09.125 --> 14:10.125
[beeps]

14:10.208 --> 14:11.708
This is Grumpy to Snow White.

14:11.792 --> 14:13.583
I've got the coordinates
for the Wicked Queen's castle.

14:13.667 --> 14:14.792
We are in position.

14:14.875 --> 14:16.125
You can break the mirror
any time you want.

14:16.208 --> 14:17.750
Stand by to receive.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.542
You're thinking
about Ivanova again?

14:31.750 --> 14:33.958
I was just thinking how much
she'd want to be here..

14:35.583 --> 14:37.375
...but Delenn was right.

14:37.458 --> 14:40.875
Back on Babylon 5,
maybe they can help her.

14:40.958 --> 14:43.750
It is the final refuge
for last hopes.

14:43.833 --> 14:45.167
There must be something
they can do.

14:46.125 --> 14:47.500
Marcus..

14:47.583 --> 14:50.583
...it may not be wise
to get your hopes up.

14:50.667 --> 14:51.667
Our doctors--

14:51.750 --> 14:53.500
(Marcus)
Could be wrong.

14:53.583 --> 14:57.250
Look, Sheridan practically
came back from the dead.

14:57.333 --> 15:00.042
We've all been through six kinds
of hell in the last few years.

15:00.125 --> 15:03.125
Don't tell me
there's nothing we can do.

15:04.750 --> 15:08.208
Since Franklin's planet side,
I've put a call in to Dr. Hobbs.

15:08.292 --> 15:10.875
'In all this time, they must
have come up with something'

15:10.958 --> 15:13.750
'to help deal
with near fatal conditions.'

15:14.500 --> 15:16.583
No.

15:16.667 --> 15:18.333
That was fast.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.667
Hit by a divine revelation,
were we?

15:20.750 --> 15:22.083
Don't you even wanna check?

15:22.167 --> 15:23.250
Don't you care?

15:24.708 --> 15:26.500
Of course I care.

15:26.583 --> 15:30.000
But there is nothing
usable on Babylon 5.

15:30.083 --> 15:31.958
What do you mean,
nothing usable?

15:34.250 --> 15:35.542
Marcus, we..

15:35.625 --> 15:36.833
[machine beeping]

15:39.250 --> 15:41.792
We're getting the attack data
from Mr. Garibaldi.

15:43.958 --> 15:46.083
He's given the all clear.

15:46.167 --> 15:49.250
Alright, relay the data
to Captain Sheridan.

15:49.333 --> 15:51.250
Tell him we're going in.

15:56.792 --> 15:58.833
[dramatic music]

16:00.917 --> 16:02.750
Okay, everybody, let's move
as far away from the windows

16:02.833 --> 16:04.333
as you can,
grab a hold of your breathers.

16:04.417 --> 16:05.875
When that jump point forms,
the pressure change

16:05.958 --> 16:07.208
is gonna be pretty intense.

16:07.292 --> 16:08.667
Jump point?

16:08.750 --> 16:10.292
You can't form a jump point
inside the atmosphere.

16:10.375 --> 16:11.750
Not this close, they'll plow
right into the ground.

16:11.833 --> 16:13.083
They'll tear
the whole place apart.

16:13.167 --> 16:14.708
Well, you can if you've
got location information

16:14.792 --> 16:15.917
accurate to within a few feet

16:16.000 --> 16:17.208
and I just made sure
they got it.

16:17.292 --> 16:19.208
Well, then I-I assume
that you worked out that

16:19.292 --> 16:20.583
whole longitude-latitude thing.

16:20.667 --> 16:22.542
I-I know you get
confused, sometimes.

16:22.625 --> 16:24.958
You're right, you're right.
I-I keep mixing them up.

16:25.042 --> 16:26.250
I got it right.

16:28.083 --> 16:30.417
Well, I think
I got it right, I mean..

16:31.542 --> 16:33.042
Okay, fine.
Which goes vertically?

16:33.125 --> 16:34.750
Longitude or latitude?

16:34.833 --> 16:36.250
Here it comes!

16:47.792 --> 16:49.167
[whooshing]

16:50.375 --> 16:52.417
[intense music]

16:54.042 --> 16:56.083
[explosions]

17:07.458 --> 17:08.583
Uh-oh.

17:11.208 --> 17:14.292
[music continues]

17:17.000 --> 17:18.750
Do you have their
defense grid on-line?

17:18.833 --> 17:20.833
Take out tower number seven,
fast!

17:26.917 --> 17:29.458
[zapping]

17:29.542 --> 17:32.958
General, the resistance has
opened fire on four of our bases

17:33.042 --> 17:34.500
'and the fifth base
has come under attack'

17:34.583 --> 17:36.125
from one of Sheridan's fleet.

17:36.208 --> 17:37.583
Our other ships
are turning back to engage.

17:37.667 --> 17:39.958
Negative. Belay that.
It's a diversion.

17:40.042 --> 17:41.458
He wants us planet bound

17:41.542 --> 17:43.792
closer to the gravity well,
so we can't maneuver.

17:43.875 --> 17:46.625
It's like forcing an enemy to
fight with his back to the sea.

17:46.708 --> 17:49.042
Tell the others
to stay in formation.

17:51.458 --> 17:52.875
It's a good first move.

17:54.167 --> 17:56.917
But he wouldn't go on
the offensive unless..

17:57.000 --> 17:58.625
...he had an ace in the hole.

18:01.125 --> 18:02.500
But, what is it?

18:04.750 --> 18:06.583
[zapping]

18:12.250 --> 18:15.167
(Sheridan)
'Lyta, we're ready. Do it.'

18:15.250 --> 18:16.458
On it.

18:24.875 --> 18:27.667
[firing continues]

18:32.667 --> 18:35.458
[intense music]

18:39.167 --> 18:40.375
Sheridan's given the word.

18:40.458 --> 18:42.583
She's cleared to activate
the packages.

18:42.667 --> 18:44.208
What packages?

18:44.292 --> 18:47.833
Telepaths we brought
with us from Babylon 5.

18:47.917 --> 18:50.750
Slipped them onto 30
of the Destroyers, one per ship.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.042
[dramatic music]

19:12.292 --> 19:15.083
What can one telepath do
against an entire Destroyer?

19:18.083 --> 19:21.125
[music continues]

19:23.542 --> 19:25.708
Well, these aren't
normal telepaths.

19:35.958 --> 19:37.417
They've been modified
by the Shadows

19:37.500 --> 19:39.083
who implanted devices
in their brains

19:39.167 --> 19:42.375
that allowed them to merge
with the Shadow vessels.

19:42.458 --> 19:45.500
Function as their central
processing units.

19:45.583 --> 19:47.333
'They're probably
waking up right now..'

19:47.417 --> 19:49.750
[hissing]

19:49.833 --> 19:51.417
...wondering where they are.

19:52.833 --> 19:54.125
Looking for the machine.

19:56.625 --> 19:58.083
'They'll start to move..'

19:58.167 --> 20:00.125
'...looking for the first open
computer relay'

20:00.208 --> 20:02.625
'and when they find it,
they'll merge with it.'

20:04.792 --> 20:06.667
Become one with the machine.

20:08.208 --> 20:11.125
The interference
will shut down the Destroyer.

20:11.208 --> 20:13.333
Let us do what we have to do.

20:14.208 --> 20:15.625
My God.

20:15.708 --> 20:17.042
You're using them.

20:17.125 --> 20:19.292
Using these people
as if they were weapons.

20:19.375 --> 20:21.125
Yeah.

20:21.208 --> 20:22.958
Yeah, we're using them..

20:23.042 --> 20:25.458
...because they are weapons.

20:25.542 --> 20:27.625
Because there are three dozen
Destroyers out there

20:27.708 --> 20:28.958
with over 1,000 crew a piece

20:29.042 --> 20:30.792
and if they can disable
those ships

20:30.875 --> 20:33.292
we risk 30 lives to save 30,000.

20:33.375 --> 20:35.542
But how can you do this to them?
You're a doctor.

20:36.875 --> 20:38.667
(Franklin)
'We can't remove those implants'

20:38.750 --> 20:41.667
without the resources
back home on earth.

20:41.750 --> 20:45.292
If we don't win this war,
they're dead either way.

20:45.375 --> 20:47.292
Now, they're fighting for Earth
the same as we are.

20:47.375 --> 20:49.375
They just don't know
they're doing it.

20:53.833 --> 20:55.000
[electricity crackling]

21:00.167 --> 21:01.292
Hey, doc.

21:02.792 --> 21:04.458
- It had to be done.
- Yeah.

21:06.792 --> 21:09.667
[sighs]
And it should work.

21:09.750 --> 21:12.042
Assuming that Lyta
can hold it together.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.042
[intense music]

21:18.583 --> 21:20.833
[whooshing]

21:27.208 --> 21:29.000
Got the launch order,
the cargo's been delivered.

21:29.083 --> 21:31.250
- Stand by to open jump point.
- Standing by.

21:31.333 --> 21:34.625
(male #4)
'Aye, sir.'

21:34.708 --> 21:36.083
Form up.

21:36.167 --> 21:37.375
Activate jump engines.

21:37.458 --> 21:38.875
Aye, sir, jump engines on line.

21:38.958 --> 21:40.125
Fleet standing by.

21:43.042 --> 21:44.708
Jump.

21:44.792 --> 21:47.833
[instrumental music]

21:51.000 --> 21:54.875
Enemy fleet coming into view,
just as you expected.

21:54.958 --> 21:57.333
Good. Tell the others
to stay in position.

21:57.417 --> 21:58.333
[alarm blaring]

21:58.417 --> 22:00.333
What the hell is going on?

22:00.417 --> 22:01.958
Computer system is failing.

22:02.042 --> 22:03.750
Security overrides are down.

22:03.833 --> 22:05.917
Sir, other Destroyers
are reporting similar problems.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.250
- All of them?
- Almost.

22:07.333 --> 22:09.042
Almost gives us some.

22:09.125 --> 22:10.875
Tell them to advance
on the enemy.

22:10.958 --> 22:12.292
If they're all
getting hit at once

22:12.375 --> 22:14.458
they must have slipped
something on board.

22:14.542 --> 22:16.750
Did we have any cargo
drops before we left?

22:16.833 --> 22:19.125
Aye, sir.

22:19.208 --> 22:20.958
Find out where they are.

22:21.042 --> 22:22.417
'Move!'

22:22.500 --> 22:23.625
Sir, we've just lost contact

22:23.708 --> 22:25.208
with the rest
of the Destroyer group.

22:25.292 --> 22:27.958
Damn, I knew he had something up
his sleeve, I knew it!

22:36.042 --> 22:38.208
(John)
'Delenn, what's our situation?'

22:38.292 --> 22:39.500
20 ships are disabled

22:39.583 --> 22:41.125
and five more are showing signs

22:41.208 --> 22:43.042
of losing control.

22:43.125 --> 22:46.042
- 'That leaves ten.'
- Yes.

22:46.125 --> 22:48.417
White Star tactical squadron
you are cleared to open fire

22:48.500 --> 22:51.000
on hostile vessels
still in operation.

22:51.083 --> 22:53.125
Target engines
and weapons systems.

22:53.208 --> 22:56.000
I want them disabled,
not destroyed.

22:57.708 --> 23:00.750
[dramatic music]

23:03.583 --> 23:05.625
[zapping]

23:05.708 --> 23:07.500
[explosions]

23:09.500 --> 23:12.458
[alarm blaring]

23:14.208 --> 23:15.292
[zapping]

23:22.583 --> 23:24.625
[zapping]

23:26.000 --> 23:27.917
Delenn, we're ready to jump.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.042
Now, tell the rest of
the League ships to stay here

23:30.125 --> 23:32.750
and keep an eye on
the Destroyers we've disabled.

23:32.833 --> 23:34.333
If they get into
any real trouble

23:34.417 --> 23:38.125
do what they can to help without
compromising their own safety.

23:38.208 --> 23:40.250
- The jump engines back on line?
- Yes, sir.

23:40.333 --> 23:41.708
Then let's move.

23:41.792 --> 23:43.167
We've taken care
of the enemy behind us.

23:43.250 --> 23:45.167
Now there's just
the enemy in front of us.

23:45.250 --> 23:47.000
We have to hit them
before the Destroyers

23:47.083 --> 23:49.125
figure out what we've done.

23:49.208 --> 23:52.000
Marcus, we're jumping.
Get up here.

23:52.083 --> 23:53.500
(Marcus)
'We're on our way.'

23:55.958 --> 23:57.417
[whooshing]

24:01.583 --> 24:02.708
You take the helm, Lennier.

24:02.792 --> 24:04.500
I'll go check on a few things.

24:13.625 --> 24:16.375
Computer, contact Babylon 5.

24:16.458 --> 24:18.333
I want a full search
of medical records.

24:18.417 --> 24:21.708
Searching key words dealing
with terminal illness..

24:21.792 --> 24:24.792
...death, and extreme measures.

24:24.875 --> 24:26.833

24:32.333 --> 24:34.375

24:37.083 --> 24:39.542
All ships, stand by to jump.

24:39.625 --> 24:43.833
Target, Earth beacon
1-1-6-2-Niner.

24:43.917 --> 24:48.500
(male #5)
'Aye-Aye, captain. Targeting
earth beacon 1-1-6-2-Niner.'

24:48.583 --> 24:50.250
Jump.

24:50.333 --> 24:53.375
[intense music]

25:05.000 --> 25:07.750

'Download from Babylon 5

25:07.833 --> 25:09.292
Let me see.

25:12.042 --> 25:15.125
Have to issue a cause
of death statement..

25:15.208 --> 25:17.417
...for Cailyn James..

25:17.500 --> 25:19.417
...age 36.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.625
Profession, singer.

25:22.875 --> 25:24.167
[sighs]
Cause of death--

25:24.250 --> 25:25.833
Skip to the next record.

25:27.583 --> 25:30.000
He sustained
severe internal injuries

25:30.083 --> 25:33.542
but at this time it does not
seem that Marcus will require--

25:33.625 --> 25:35.083
Next record.

25:36.667 --> 25:38.667
At which point
Captain Sheridan and I

25:38.750 --> 25:40.583
were able to revive
Mr. Garibaldi

25:40.667 --> 25:42.750
after being shot in the back.

25:42.833 --> 25:46.125
But, even this brief exposure,
a few seconds a piece

25:46.208 --> 25:49.292
confirms that the alien healing
device is extremely dangerous

25:49.375 --> 25:51.292
and should not be used again.

25:51.375 --> 25:54.417
Even under extreme conditions..

25:54.500 --> 25:56.458
...'till we can control it,
more precisely--

25:56.542 --> 25:58.750
Computer, stop.

25:58.833 --> 26:01.875

26:01.958 --> 26:03.833

'Stand by, arranging reports.'

26:03.917 --> 26:05.833
And prepare a shuttle
for launch.

26:07.292 --> 26:09.958
[instrumental music]

26:12.417 --> 26:13.292
Status?

26:13.375 --> 26:14.375
We've eliminated the problem,

26:14.458 --> 26:15.583
but we still can't navigate.

26:15.667 --> 26:17.083
Engineering is working
to restore control.

26:17.167 --> 26:18.167
Com systems?

26:18.250 --> 26:20.125
Ship to ship is down.
Internal com only.

26:20.208 --> 26:23.125
We can't tell the other ships
what we've figured out.

26:23.208 --> 26:25.667
Engineering,
this is General Lefcourt.

26:25.750 --> 26:28.208
In case you didn't notice, the
enemy just pulled our shorts up

26:28.292 --> 26:30.292
over our head
and tied them in a knot.

26:30.375 --> 26:32.917
You will get the ship
under control ASAP

26:33.000 --> 26:34.292
or I will come down there

26:34.375 --> 26:36.583
and skin the hide off
every last one of you!

26:46.208 --> 26:48.708
Yes, Lennier, what is it?

26:48.792 --> 26:49.708
What?

26:49.792 --> 26:51.042
You sent for me, Delenn.

26:51.125 --> 26:52.417
No, no, you're mistaken.

26:52.500 --> 26:54.583
- Who?
- Marcus.

27:01.333 --> 27:03.375
[whooshing]

27:05.292 --> 27:08.417
[music continues]

27:29.417 --> 27:32.292
Captain, Delenn for you
on Channel 4.

27:37.167 --> 27:38.833
Delenn, what is it?

27:38.917 --> 27:41.250
(Delenn)
'John, Marcus is gone.'

27:43.125 --> 27:44.792
Gone?

27:44.875 --> 27:47.125
But he-he wasn't hit.

27:47.208 --> 27:51.542
(Delenn)
'He left. Lennier believes
to Babylon 5.'

27:51.625 --> 27:54.250
What?
Can't be.

27:54.333 --> 27:56.667
Marcus would never run out
in the middle of a battle.

27:56.750 --> 27:58.917
What the hell's on Babylon 5?

27:59.000 --> 28:02.417
(Delenn)
'John, I think you should
take this privately.'

28:15.833 --> 28:17.000
Go ahead.

28:23.250 --> 28:24.500
Are you sure?

28:33.042 --> 28:34.583
Can you get a signal
to Babylon 5?

28:34.667 --> 28:37.625
Negative. As soon as we
got inside Mars' orbit

28:37.708 --> 28:39.292
we hit the jammers.

28:39.375 --> 28:40.667
Captain, we're almost to earth.

28:40.750 --> 28:42.958
Their probes will pick us up
any second.

28:43.042 --> 28:45.167
Either we go right now,
or we abort.

28:53.958 --> 28:55.875
There's nothing we can do.

28:55.958 --> 28:57.792
Tell the others, we jump now.

28:57.875 --> 29:00.125
Activate jump engines.
Stand by to jump.

29:00.208 --> 29:01.583
(male #6)
'Aye, sir.'

29:01.667 --> 29:02.750
(James)
'Jump!'

29:03.833 --> 29:05.125
I'm sorry, Delenn.

29:06.708 --> 29:08.750
[dramatic music]

29:18.042 --> 29:19.250
You're on.

29:27.167 --> 29:29.042
This is Captain John Sheridan.

29:30.500 --> 29:34.375
We are here on the authority
of a multi planetary force

29:34.458 --> 29:36.500
that can no longer
stand by and watch

29:36.583 --> 29:38.250
one of their greatest allies

29:38.333 --> 29:41.417
falling into darkness
and despair.

29:41.500 --> 29:44.750
We are here on behalf
of the thousands of civilians

29:44.833 --> 29:48.250
murdered under orders
from the current administration

29:48.333 --> 29:50.958
who have no one else
to speak for them.

29:51.042 --> 29:54.458
And on behalf of the Earthforce
units that have joined us

29:54.542 --> 29:57.667
to oppose the tyranny
earth

29:57.750 --> 30:00.792
ever since President Santiago
was assassinated

30:00.875 --> 30:02.542
three years ago.

30:04.667 --> 30:07.917
'We are here to place
President Clark under arrest'

30:08.000 --> 30:09.708
'to disband night watch'

30:09.792 --> 30:11.875
'and return our government'

30:11.958 --> 30:13.750
'to the hands of her people.'

30:18.458 --> 30:21.458
[rumbling]

30:24.208 --> 30:26.583
Planetary defense grid
is activated.

30:26.667 --> 30:28.250
Getting a fix on our position.

30:29.792 --> 30:32.583
We know that many in the
government have wanted to act..

30:32.667 --> 30:35.250
...but have been intimidated
by threats of retaliation

30:35.333 --> 30:38.333
against your families,
your friends.

30:38.417 --> 30:41.417
You are not alone anymore.

30:41.500 --> 30:44.917
We call upon you to rise up
and do what's right.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.958
We have drawn their forces

30:47.042 --> 30:49.417
away from earth
and disabled them.

30:49.500 --> 30:52.083
The time to act is now.

30:52.167 --> 30:55.208
[intense music]

30:57.667 --> 30:59.917
This is not
the voice of treason.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.375
These..

31:01.458 --> 31:04.208
...are your sons, your daughters

31:04.292 --> 31:06.417
...whose loyalties
have never wavered.

31:06.500 --> 31:09.250
Whose beliefs in this alliance..

31:09.333 --> 31:13.250
...has forced us to take
extraordinary means..

31:13.333 --> 31:16.708
...for justice, for peace..

31:16.792 --> 31:18.000
...for the future.

31:19.083 --> 31:21.000
We have come home.

31:21.708 --> 31:24.792
[music continues]

31:32.750 --> 31:34.542
[beeping]

31:40.708 --> 31:41.708
Status?

31:41.792 --> 31:44.083
Defense grid armed and firing.

31:46.542 --> 31:47.875
Incoming red alert!

31:47.958 --> 31:49.875
All ships, evasive action.

31:49.958 --> 31:52.833
Launch Starfuries,
target incoming missiles.

31:56.542 --> 31:59.625
[music continues]

32:10.667 --> 32:13.708
[explosions]

32:16.083 --> 32:18.917
Destroyer group,
target local defense platforms.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.708
Fire at will.

32:20.792 --> 32:22.042
Keep monitoring all channels.

32:22.125 --> 32:23.958
Let me know the second
you get an answer.

32:26.208 --> 32:29.208
[zapping]

32:30.583 --> 32:32.083
[banging on door]

32:43.542 --> 32:44.750
[gunshot]

32:54.292 --> 32:57.333
[intense music]

33:30.292 --> 33:32.333
[beeps]

33:32.417 --> 33:34.542
I need to talk
to Captain Sheridan.

33:36.458 --> 33:38.333
Signal coming in from Earthdome.

33:40.208 --> 33:43.625
Put it through and route it
to the rest of the ships.

33:43.708 --> 33:44.875
(Crosby)
'Captain Sheridan'

33:44.958 --> 33:47.125
this is
an emergency transmission.

33:47.208 --> 33:48.833
President Clark is dead.

33:48.917 --> 33:51.875
He took his own life
before we could arrest him.

33:51.958 --> 33:54.417
But he left a message
on his desk.

33:54.500 --> 33:58.292
Two words, "Scorched Earth".

33:59.875 --> 34:03.750
Captain, I believe he's turned
the defense grid toward Earth.

34:03.833 --> 34:06.500
We can't override
the systems here.

34:06.583 --> 34:09.708
If you don't stop them,
they'll fire in ten minutes.

34:10.417 --> 34:13.500
[music continues]

34:17.125 --> 34:20.833
(Crosby)
'Captain, the particle beams
on those defense platforms'

34:20.917 --> 34:23.833
'can level 40%
of the planet's surface.'

34:23.917 --> 34:26.792
'You have to stop them
before they can fire.'

34:26.875 --> 34:29.500
Sheridan to attack fleet.

34:29.583 --> 34:30.958
You heard the senator.

34:31.042 --> 34:33.333
All ships, fire at will.

34:33.417 --> 34:35.750
Delenn, we need you.

34:38.750 --> 34:40.125
We are there.

34:40.833 --> 34:43.625
[intense music]

34:49.167 --> 34:51.083
[zapping]

34:52.125 --> 34:55.167

[explosions]

35:14.500 --> 35:17.000
[grunting]

35:17.083 --> 35:19.500
Missiles impacting on all sides!

35:19.583 --> 35:20.833
Continue firing!

35:20.917 --> 35:22.792
I don't know how much more
she can take!

35:22.875 --> 35:24.333
Continue firing!

35:26.625 --> 35:29.708
[intense music]

35:36.542 --> 35:39.583
[explosions]

35:52.708 --> 35:55.708
[grunting]

35:57.958 --> 36:00.500
Forward guns are down.
We can't fire.

36:02.625 --> 36:05.458
Particle beams coming online
for the nearest platform.

36:06.292 --> 36:08.167
- Ready to fire.
- Target?

36:08.250 --> 36:09.583
North America.

36:09.667 --> 36:11.583
It'll wipe out
most of the eastern seaboard.

36:14.500 --> 36:17.583
John, there's no one else
close enough to stop it.

36:19.250 --> 36:22.292
[dramatic music]

36:32.292 --> 36:33.750
All power to engines.

36:35.292 --> 36:37.208
Give me ramming speed.

36:40.042 --> 36:43.083
Aye, sir.

36:43.167 --> 36:46.000
[music continues]

37:13.792 --> 37:15.083
Apollo to Agamemnon!

37:15.167 --> 37:16.375
We have monitored the situation.

37:16.458 --> 37:17.917
Hold on to your hats!

37:19.708 --> 37:22.042
[zapping]

37:22.125 --> 37:24.917
[explosions]

37:30.458 --> 37:32.625
[gasps]
John!

37:37.208 --> 37:40.000
[music continues]

37:44.875 --> 37:47.292
The last platform's
been destroyed.

37:50.708 --> 37:51.917
[chuckles]

37:53.375 --> 37:55.375
[laughs]

37:57.750 --> 37:59.000
(Lefcourt)
'Sorry for the delay, captain'

37:59.083 --> 38:01.000
but we had some trouble on Mars.

38:01.083 --> 38:03.125
You might have heard
something about it.

38:05.333 --> 38:06.958
Well, my apologies, general.

38:08.375 --> 38:10.333
We're only doing our jobs.

38:10.417 --> 38:11.583
Though you'll have
to stand before

38:11.667 --> 38:14.042
a board of inquiry
on this one, Sheridan..

38:14.125 --> 38:16.792
...still..

38:16.875 --> 38:18.292
...welcome home, John.

38:19.542 --> 38:20.750
'Welcome home.'

38:24.458 --> 38:26.375
[exhales deeply]

38:26.458 --> 38:29.500
[dramatic music]

38:38.625 --> 38:40.000
[spacecraft droning]

38:45.292 --> 38:46.333
[whooshing]

38:48.917 --> 38:51.417
They want you in Earthdome
as soon as you can get there.

38:51.500 --> 38:53.375
I don't know if it will be
a ticker tape parade

38:53.458 --> 38:54.833
but it should be interesting.

38:54.917 --> 38:56.125
Congratulations.

38:56.208 --> 38:58.125
To all of us, captain.
To all of us.

38:58.208 --> 39:00.417
I suppose Ambassador Delenn
and Dr. Franklin

39:00.500 --> 39:01.750
will be joining you planet side?

39:01.833 --> 39:04.125
No, Delenn has some business
to attend to

39:04.208 --> 39:06.458
and Stephen's heading back
to Babylon 5.

39:06.542 --> 39:09.625
Senator Crosby hasn't been able
to shut down those jammers yet

39:09.708 --> 39:11.500
so Stephen's going out
as fast as he can

39:11.583 --> 39:12.917
to get past the jammers.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.125
Why?

39:15.208 --> 39:17.875
To stop someone from making
a terrible mistake.

39:19.208 --> 39:22.292
[instrumental music]

39:27.833 --> 39:29.292
Hello.

39:32.625 --> 39:33.875
[sniffling]

39:36.333 --> 39:37.708
I want to..

39:37.792 --> 39:39.583
...welcome back our viewers.

39:41.292 --> 39:43.208
We've been gone a long time.

39:43.292 --> 39:45.125
[clears throat]

39:45.208 --> 39:49.792
Over a year since,
ISN was captured by elite forces

39:49.875 --> 39:52.500
sent by President Clark.

39:52.583 --> 39:56.458
Over a year
since martial law was declared.

39:56.542 --> 40:00.042
Many of us, and our associates
at other networks

40:00.125 --> 40:04.208
were imprisoned, interrogated,
even killed.

40:07.167 --> 40:09.667
All that changed last night.

40:09.750 --> 40:14.292
At 1:45 a.m.
Earth standard time

40:14.375 --> 40:18.250
a multi planetary force, led by
ships loyal to a free Earth

40:18.333 --> 40:21.375
engaged Clark's forces directly.

40:21.458 --> 40:23.125
'Under the command
of John Sheridan'

40:23.208 --> 40:27.667
'the incoming forces disabled
or destroyed their opposition.'

40:27.750 --> 40:30.125
'Then prevented further
destruction by taking out'

40:30.208 --> 40:31.667
'the planetary defense grid'

40:31.750 --> 40:35.625
whose lethal power
was being turned toward Earth.

40:35.708 --> 40:38.083
Earthgov is still working
to compile the names of those

40:38.167 --> 40:41.000
injured or killed
on either side of the battle.

40:41.083 --> 40:43.625
If you have family members
who may have been involved

40:43.708 --> 40:48.875
you can request information from
a special Earthforce com-line.

40:48.958 --> 40:52.667
Our thoughts and prayers go out
to those injured on both sides.

40:52.750 --> 40:55.750
We are all equally sons
and daughters of Earth

40:55.833 --> 40:56.958
and in the coming months

40:57.042 --> 40:59.125
we must continue
to remember that

40:59.208 --> 41:01.208
if we are to heal and move on.

41:07.000 --> 41:11.375
This is Dr. Franklin
to Babylon 5. Please respond.

41:11.458 --> 41:14.500
This is Franklin to Babylon 5.
Please respond.

41:15.500 --> 41:17.250
Nothing.

41:17.333 --> 41:19.375
Keep sending it.

41:19.458 --> 41:20.958
Let me see it again.

41:23.417 --> 41:25.708
At which point,
Captain Sheridan and I

41:25.792 --> 41:28.000
were able to revive
Mr. Garibaldi

41:28.083 --> 41:29.625
'after being shot in the back.'

41:33.708 --> 41:34.875
This is the device, huh?

41:34.958 --> 41:37.875
- Correct. I was just about to--
- Plug me in.

41:37.958 --> 41:39.083
No, I-I thought we agreed--

41:39.167 --> 41:41.625
I can't have you
giving your life energy

41:41.708 --> 41:44.583
and operating this machine
at the same time.

41:44.667 --> 41:47.625
What happens if you pass out
during the process, huh?

41:47.708 --> 41:49.292
'It'll just keep taking
your life energy'

41:49.375 --> 41:51.042
'until you're dead, correct?'

41:51.125 --> 41:54.042
- I don't know.
- 'Exactly.'

41:54.125 --> 41:57.333
(Franklin)
'Even this brief exposure,
a few seconds a piece'

41:57.417 --> 41:59.125
'confirms
that the alien healing device'

41:59.208 --> 42:00.458
is extremely dangerous

42:00.542 --> 42:02.667
and should not be used again..

42:02.750 --> 42:05.667
...even under
extreme conditions..

42:05.750 --> 42:09.500
...till we can control it
more precisely..

42:09.583 --> 42:12.167
'...or it will result in
the death of whoever uses it.'

42:14.708 --> 42:17.750
It was, after all designed as
a means of capital punishment.

42:18.708 --> 42:21.750
[dramatic music]

42:35.500 --> 42:37.500
(Stephen)
It does this
by transferring life energy

42:37.583 --> 42:39.125
from one person to another.

42:41.792 --> 42:43.667
The process is irreversible.

42:45.208 --> 42:47.250
In cases of fatal illness
or injury

42:47.333 --> 42:49.792
for one person to live..

42:49.875 --> 42:51.208
...the other must die.

42:52.042 --> 42:55.083
[music continues]

43:13.292 --> 43:14.750
I love you.

43:32.333 --> 43:34.750
[theme music]

44:05.292 --> 44:08.333
[instrumental music]
