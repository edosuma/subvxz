You're smiling.

00:04.862 --> 00:07.629
It's very weird, like seeing
a turtle out of its shell.

00:07.664 --> 00:08.898
I'm happy.

00:08.899 --> 00:10.499
Our drug task force
was a success,

00:10.500 --> 00:12.902
and today, I get to watch
my Nemesis, Madeline Wuntch,

00:12.903 --> 00:14.803
drape a medal around my neck.

00:14.838 --> 00:16.338
Also, we cleaned up the streets.

00:16.373 --> 00:17.573
Yeah, sure.
That's good too.

00:17.574 --> 00:19.542
So I've been planning
how to zing Madeline

00:19.543 --> 00:20.842

really show her

08:14.031 --> 08:15.130
Hmm.

08:15.165 --> 08:16.232
[Camera shutter snapping]

08:16.233 --> 08:18.433
Black SUV, female driver.

08:18.468 --> 08:20.168
<i>She's wearing a lot
of drab colors,</i>

08:20.203 --> 08:22.371
so we'll call her Mrs. peacock.

08:22.372 --> 08:24.640
Male peacocks are
the colorful dressers.

08:24.641 --> 08:27.475
God, how did humans
get it so backwards?

08:27.511 --> 08:28.676
We may never know.
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

08:29.913 --> 08:33.581
Hey, listen, about
our alone zone close call...

08:33.616 --> 08:34.817
Oh, that...
It's not a big deal.

08:34.818 --> 08:36.484
We're not gonna start fighting.
We never fight.

08:36.520 --> 08:37.520
Yeah, totally.
<i>Yeah.</i>

08:37.520 --> 08:39.121
That's what I was thinking.

08:39.121 --> 08:41.590
But just to be safe,
we could write down

08:41.591 --> 08:43.192
some of each other's
annoying behaviors

08:43.193 --> 08:45.561
that we want to be
off-limits, you know?

08:45.562 --> 08:46.995
We could call it
"the no-no list."

08:47.030 --> 08:49.998
Oh, I love it.

08:50.033 --> 08:52.867
Okay, so here's
what I've got for you.

08:52.903 --> 08:54.269
No eating with your mouth open.

08:54.304 --> 08:55.304
We knew that.

08:55.305 --> 08:58.340
No rasta-man voice,
no reciting poetry,

08:58.341 --> 09:02.311
no ballroom dancing, no bird
calls, and no male kegels.

09:02.312 --> 09:04.346
Can I do my kegels secretly?
Watch this.

09:04.347 --> 09:06.848
You'll never know
I'm doing them.

09:06.883 --> 09:08.484
I can definitely tell.

09:08.485 --> 09:10.018
All right, give me my no-no's.

09:10.053 --> 09:13.889
Okay, no butter-syrup, no
talking about <i> Die Hard...</i>

09:13.890 --> 09:15.391
Okay.
I can do that.

09:15.392 --> 09:17.026
Or <i> Die Hard two</i>
or <i> Die Hard three.</i>

09:17.027 --> 09:18.194
What?
Come on.

09:18.195 --> 09:19.994
So you just want me
to talk about the fourth one?

09:20.030 --> 09:21.563
There's a fourth one?
Charles!

09:21.598 --> 09:23.318
No judging me
for not knowing the <i> Die Hards.</i>

09:23.333 --> 09:24.732
All right, fine. What else?
Okay.

09:24.768 --> 09:26.869
No eating mayonnaise
straight from the jar,

09:26.870 --> 09:28.069
no using my toothbrush.

09:28.105 --> 09:29.305
And that's it.

09:29.306 --> 09:32.007
Jake, this no-no list,
it's a slam dunk.

09:32.008 --> 09:33.007
Oop me.

09:33.009 --> 09:35.144
Ooping.

09:35.145 --> 09:36.711
[Grunts, groans]

09:37.714 --> 09:38.913
I'm getting better.

09:38.949 --> 09:40.014
Yeah, you are.

09:40.050 --> 09:41.716
(Rosa)
You wanted to see me, sir?

09:41.751 --> 09:43.985
Have a seat, Diaz.

09:44.020 --> 09:47.857
You remember my nephew Marcus?
The 31-year-old?

09:47.858 --> 09:49.925
He asked me to ask you
if you are single.

09:49.926 --> 09:52.128
I'm told him I'm not
a third-grade girl

09:52.129 --> 09:53.995
with pigtails
passing love notes.

09:54.030 --> 09:55.697
Yeah, it's so immature.

09:55.732 --> 09:57.198
Precisely.
It's embarrassing.

09:57.234 --> 09:58.901
Agreed.

09:58.902 --> 09:59.901
I am single.

09:59.903 --> 10:01.537
Oh.

10:01.538 --> 10:02.537
I see.

10:02.539 --> 10:06.274
But if Marcus wants my number,
he can ask me for it.

10:09.613 --> 10:13.414
But who will tell him that?

10:15.819 --> 10:17.186
Um, yeah.

10:17.187 --> 10:18.620
You took the last danish.

10:18.655 --> 10:20.021
Oh, sorry.

10:20.056 --> 10:22.491
Did you read Terry's book
about us?

10:22.492 --> 10:24.659
No.
He said not to read it.

10:26.429 --> 10:27.595
Okay, fine, I read it.

10:27.631 --> 10:30.232
My character, cricket,
is such a pushover.

10:30.233 --> 10:31.600
She just lets
all the forest folk

10:31.601 --> 10:33.201
take her magic moose wishes.

10:33.236 --> 10:35.738
Well, june bug
is a stone-cold bitch.

10:35.739 --> 10:39.808
She told all the baby platy-pups
they had weird feet.

10:39.809 --> 10:41.242
Is that how people see us?

10:41.278 --> 10:43.512
Well, you did just steal
that danish out of my hand

10:43.513 --> 10:44.880
and start eating it.

10:44.881 --> 10:46.282
And I let you.

10:46.283 --> 10:47.783
And apologized.

10:47.784 --> 10:49.284
Classic cricket move.

10:49.319 --> 10:52.788
Hey, can I just scootch
in there to the coffee?

10:52.789 --> 10:56.224
You can scootch your ass
back in line.

10:56.259 --> 10:59.827
My coffee needs
are just as important as yours.

11:03.300 --> 11:04.299
What was that all about?

11:04.301 --> 11:07.468
Terry, I try not to judge
people, so I wouldn't know.

11:07.504 --> 11:09.471
Maybe I should
go check on little Amy

11:09.472 --> 11:11.507
and give her
the greatest gift of all...

11:11.508 --> 11:12.907
A hug.

11:14.511 --> 11:16.110
Come on.

11:16.146 --> 11:19.013
Someone use the drop house.

11:19.049 --> 11:20.849
[Gasps] The drop house.

11:20.850 --> 11:23.052
Perfect name
for a porta-potty company.

11:23.053 --> 11:24.320
As soon as we get out of here,

11:24.321 --> 11:26.588
I am taking that
straight to <i> shark tank.</i>

11:26.623 --> 11:28.857
How great is this no-no list?

11:28.858 --> 11:32.260
I mean, we've made it impossible
to annoy each other.

11:32.295 --> 11:35.029
We're gonna make out
with this stakeout.

11:35.065 --> 11:37.766
Mm.
[Chuckles]

11:37.767 --> 11:40.034
Hey, bud, is rhyming
on your no-no list?

11:40.070 --> 11:41.135
No.

11:41.171 --> 11:43.405
Cool, cool.

11:43.406 --> 11:46.975
Just seems pretty close
to reciting poetry.

11:47.010 --> 11:48.776
Yeah, yeah.
But it's different.

11:48.812 --> 11:50.346
Yeah.
It's different.

11:50.347 --> 11:51.547
It's different.

11:51.548 --> 11:53.682
[Sniffs]

11:53.683 --> 11:55.883
I'm just gonna add it.

11:55.919 --> 11:58.219
Oh, so we can add things now?

11:58.255 --> 11:59.555
Yeah, why not, right?

11:59.556 --> 12:01.456
I mean, we got the time,
and we got the ink.

12:01.491 --> 12:02.790
Everything but the kitchen sink.

12:02.826 --> 12:04.025
What did I just say?

12:04.060 --> 12:05.561
Okay.
That is under Charles.

12:05.562 --> 12:07.096
Sure, sure, sure.
Cool, cool, cool...

12:11.034 --> 12:12.033
Good. To the window.

Get back in the window.

12:16.439 --> 12:17.839
What is happening?

12:17.874 --> 12:20.475
I got to do this or the bullet
holes in my butt stiffen up.

No talking about
your butt holes.

No more talking at all.

13:23.793 --> 13:25.460
Fine, I'm putting that
on your list too.

13:25.461 --> 13:26.827
That was talking.

13:26.863 --> 13:27.862
So was that.

13:27.864 --> 13:30.165
Okay, fine.
In three, two, one.

Hey, Captain.

13:45.415 --> 13:46.614
How's the operation going?

13:46.649 --> 13:49.150
Great, the beach umbrella
has had nonstop visitors.

13:49.185 --> 13:50.618
"The beach umbrella"?

13:50.653 --> 13:52.853
Bisko's lieutenant
who runs the drop site.

13:52.889 --> 13:54.789
We came up with fun little
nicknames for everyone.

13:54.824 --> 13:56.625
I'm glad you're amusing
yourselves.

at each other's throats by now.

the resemblance stops.

Sure, june bug is a meanie
to the platy-pups,

15:03.626 --> 15:06.060
but she's a sweetheart
to the socktopus.

15:08.164 --> 15:09.931

magic moose wishes,

15:09.932 --> 15:13.868
but she's very brave
in the dolphin wars.

these stories are nonsense.

the elevator,

Well, I guess so,
since words came out of my mouth

what "glib" means.
