bake shop in red hook.</i>

04:11.284 --> 04:13.819
Oh, Megan,
right where I left you.

04:13.821 --> 04:16.622
How adorable.
You caught me red-handed.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.557
I'm just...
I'm such a sucker

04:18.559 --> 04:20.325
for the classic American novel.

04:22.729 --> 04:25.731
Bad day?
No, I'm just exhausted.

04:25.733 --> 04:28.734
Yeah, I know,
me too, right?

04:28.736 --> 04:29.968
Oof...

04:29.970 --> 04:34.339
Maybe it's time...
To get a job.

04:34.341 --> 04:35.574
You're telling me...

04:35.576 --> 04:36.975
Yes, I am.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.144
I look for fulfilling
work all the time.

04:39.146 --> 04:41.146
I just happen to be taking a
break whenever you're around.

04:41.148 --> 04:43.215
It's like studying when
mom is watching.

04:43.217 --> 04:44.816
Did you talk to your
parents about the lease?

04:44.818 --> 04:46.251
Because the deadline's
on the first

04:46.253 --> 04:48.754
and Cedric is willing
to take over if you...

04:48.756 --> 04:50.822
yeah, no, I haven't made
a decision on that

04:50.824 --> 04:53.759
yet, per se...

04:53.761 --> 04:55.627
How did you not
make a decision yet?

04:55.629 --> 04:57.829
I mean, what did you do today?

04:57.831 --> 05:00.866
What did you do this week?

05:00.868 --> 05:03.001
I did Christmas.

05:05.538 --> 05:07.306
And I also started
online dating.

05:07.308 --> 05:09.141
Seriously?

05:09.143 --> 05:10.309
Ah!

05:10.311 --> 05:12.344
¶¶

05:12.346 --> 05:14.179
Yes, yeah, shut up.

05:14.181 --> 05:16.415
No, I'm proud.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.816
Meet anyone?

05:17.818 --> 05:19.217
I said, started.

05:19.219 --> 05:21.586
I'm not a machine.

05:21.588 --> 05:24.990
Oh, oh, and, um, I also
really like that idea

05:24.992 --> 05:27.092
of going Dutch
on principle except,

05:27.094 --> 05:28.460
you know, I don't have any money

05:28.462 --> 05:33.165
so it's kind of more
of an intellectual exercise.

05:33.167 --> 05:34.666
Hey, whoa, where are you going?

05:34.668 --> 05:36.702
You just got home.
Cedric's friend
is having this

05:36.704 --> 05:38.136
birthday thing at this bar.

05:38.138 --> 05:41.473
So then you're not
cooking dinner?

05:41.475 --> 05:43.408
No... yeah.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.313
Do you want to come?

05:48.315 --> 05:50.582
Well, it kind of depends
on the cake situation.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.084
Well, the birthday boy
is single.

05:52.086 --> 05:53.452
And he's not
the brightest but he's pretty,

05:53.454 --> 05:56.355
so he's perfect for
a one-night stand.

05:56.357 --> 05:57.389
I don't know.

05:57.391 --> 05:59.224
Do you think
I'm ready?
Who cares?

05:59.226 --> 06:00.492
I'm ready for you to be ready.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.627
I mean seriously,
how long has it been?

06:02.629 --> 06:03.995
Aren't you horny?

06:03.997 --> 06:05.630
Now see, I knew you two
little freaks be having

06:05.632 --> 06:07.699
these type of conversations
when I'm not around.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.201
I knew it,
especially you.

06:09.203 --> 06:11.470
Hi, Cedric.
I knew it,
I caught you.

06:11.472 --> 06:15.006
Well, yes, no, I'm horny
but I'm also...

06:15.008 --> 06:17.275
Somewhat lazy, sometimes.

06:17.277 --> 06:20.846
So the two counteract,
like dueling wizards...

06:20.848 --> 06:22.214
not anymore.

06:22.216 --> 06:24.950
Tonight is the night.
Faiza's setting me up.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.385
I'm thinking Ben.

06:26.387 --> 06:27.919
I like that,
that's cool.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.955
(Whispering)
Ben.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.289
Whoop.

06:31.291 --> 06:33.058
¶¶

06:35.862 --> 06:37.329
Hello.
Hi.

06:37.331 --> 06:38.196
What's up?

06:38.198 --> 06:39.965
ID please.
I'm a girl.

06:39.967 --> 06:42.300
Uh, no, I'm sorry,
you look kinda young.

06:42.302 --> 06:44.536
Take it like a compliment,
all right?

06:48.141 --> 06:50.041
Shit!
How did you lose
your ID again?

06:50.043 --> 06:51.309
You don't go anywhere.

06:51.311 --> 06:53.345
Okay, wait, look,
I am old enough, I swear.

06:53.347 --> 06:55.147
Do you see that,
right there?

06:55.149 --> 06:57.015
It moves.
(Faiza)
Oh my God, Megan.

06:59.352 --> 07:00.919
Hey, ID.

07:03.523 --> 07:05.290
(Cedric)
Oh, shit.

07:05.292 --> 07:06.925
Awkward.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.329
Hey.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.300
I heard you're doing good.

07:15.302 --> 07:17.068
From who?

07:17.070 --> 07:18.937
I don't know,
I just...

07:18.939 --> 07:20.305
Said that to be nice.

07:20.307 --> 07:22.140
Oh...

07:24.610 --> 07:27.345
Chris, I think this girl's
trying to get by you.

07:27.347 --> 07:28.747
Oh, no.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.715
Uh, this is...
this is Becca.

07:30.717 --> 07:33.151
Becca, this is faiza
and Cedric and Megan.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.687
Megan and I, we were
together for a bit.

07:36.923 --> 07:40.325
Is the abridged version,
just like that?

07:40.327 --> 07:42.461
(Man)
You two coming in or what?

07:44.597 --> 07:46.565
Nice to meet you.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.333
(Chris)
Good seeing you, Megan.

07:49.936 --> 07:52.103
I don't even want to
hear you guys say it.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.772
Listen, if we knew that
he was going to be here

07:53.774 --> 07:55.040
I would have warned you.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.809
This is a serious pattern,
I am regressing.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.010
Last year I was in college

07:59.012 --> 08:00.312
and I was Chris's fiancée

08:00.314 --> 08:02.380
and I drank wine in restaurants.

08:02.382 --> 08:05.116
And now I am at home all
day in my underwear,

08:05.118 --> 08:06.785
and I'm nobody's nothing,

08:06.787 --> 08:08.286
and I can't even get into a bar.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.588
What is happening to me?

08:09.590 --> 08:11.189
I am going backwards!

08:11.191 --> 08:12.824
I am Benjamin button-ing!

08:12.826 --> 08:14.693
He moved on,
so what, so can you.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.061
I say take a cab home,

08:16.063 --> 08:18.330
get on that dating
site, pick a cute guy.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.565
No drinks, no dinner,
just a hook-up.

08:20.567 --> 08:23.034
You can't order it,

08:23.036 --> 08:24.703
it's not edible arrangements!

08:24.705 --> 08:25.971
Uh, yeah, you can.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.706
You have tits and the Internet.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.074
Cedric, back me up.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.709
Internet, tits.
Mm-hmm.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.977
Desperate times call for
desperate measures.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.413
Go get them, tiger,
you got this... mwah.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.517
Right?

08:40.520 --> 08:42.187
¶¶

09:04.644 --> 09:06.044
Ah...

09:28.668 --> 09:30.068
Nope.

09:35.007 --> 09:36.408
(Sighing)

09:38.844 --> 09:40.245
Okay.

09:41.881 --> 09:43.214
Fuck it.

09:43.216 --> 09:45.183
He moved on,
so can I.

09:46.652 --> 09:48.153
Hey...

09:56.262 --> 09:58.229
Keeping it lowercase.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.098
Keeping it casual.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.503
Really?!

10:08.908 --> 10:11.176
Okay... come on.

10:11.178 --> 10:14.279
The bar is so low,
it's so very low.

10:25.324 --> 10:27.459
I sound like a computer virus.

10:28.828 --> 10:31.630
Awesome.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.131
Okay.

10:46.445 --> 10:48.813
Do you want to hang out?

11:04.997 --> 11:06.598
(Chuckling)

11:15.675 --> 11:16.741
(Chuckling)

11:18.678 --> 11:19.878
Wait!

11:19.880 --> 11:21.513
Oh, shit.

11:36.328 --> 11:38.229
Safety first.

11:41.067 --> 11:42.467
(Chuckling)

11:46.038 --> 11:47.872
(Computer ringing)

11:49.909 --> 11:51.342
<i>Hey, there.</i>

11:51.344 --> 11:54.012
Oh man, I was... I was just
so sure that I was gonna see

11:54.014 --> 11:55.513
a close-up of
a penis.

11:55.515 --> 11:58.450
<i>Um, yeah, me too.</i>

11:58.452 --> 12:01.186
<i>Wow, you are really pretty.</i>

12:01.188 --> 12:02.620
<i>Really pretty.</i>

12:02.622 --> 12:05.023
<i>Uh, anyway,
so this is me.</i>

12:05.025 --> 12:10.995
<i>Soak it in, um, and this
is my apartment.</i>

12:10.997 --> 12:15.734
<i>As you can see,
it's a magical wonderland.</i>

12:15.736 --> 12:19.204
<i>So do I pass the test or...</i>

12:19.206 --> 12:23.541
Um, yes, I think so.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.944
I've actually... I've never
done this before.

12:25.946 --> 12:28.480
<i>Me neither.</i>
No, no, no, no,
like I know...

12:28.482 --> 12:30.115
I know that people say that,

12:30.117 --> 12:32.383
but I really...
I haven't, nothing.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.853
<i>I know, me either.</i>

12:34.855 --> 12:38.423
Oh, good, um...

12:38.425 --> 12:42.527
Okay, well, I guess then
I will see you soon?

12:42.529 --> 12:43.962
<i>That is awesome.</i>

12:43.964 --> 12:46.965
<i>I mean, that is cool,
sweet, I will...</i>

12:46.967 --> 12:49.167
<i>that will be a very nice
thing to happen, Megan.</i>

12:49.169 --> 12:50.835
<i>I will see you soon.</i>

12:50.837 --> 12:52.904
Okay.

12:52.906 --> 12:54.372
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

12:57.409 --> 13:00.478
I cannot believe
I am schlepping to Brooklyn

13:00.480 --> 13:01.579
for a Booty call.

13:01.581 --> 13:03.414
That is fucking scandalous.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.350
<i>I don't think it shut off right.</i>

13:05.352 --> 13:07.252
No, no, the TV.

13:07.254 --> 13:09.287
(Alarm beeping)

13:12.658 --> 13:13.858
(Snoring)

13:13.860 --> 13:17.328
(Alarm blaring)

13:18.464 --> 13:20.765
Is that a...
is that a burglar alarm?

13:21.767 --> 13:23.968
Did you sleep with your coat on?

13:23.970 --> 13:25.737
Yeah, I get cold.

13:25.739 --> 13:27.472
Get the intruder!

13:27.474 --> 13:30.542
(Alarm blaring)

13:31.777 --> 13:32.677
(Alarm beeping)

13:32.679 --> 13:34.679
<i>(Woman)
Alarm reset.</i>

13:36.949 --> 13:38.283
False alarm.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.318
Oh, that's so weird.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.620
It's a bummer that
it woke us up though,

13:42.622 --> 13:45.056
but I should get going.

13:45.058 --> 13:47.358
Um...

13:47.360 --> 13:50.328
I had a great time,
thank you.

13:50.330 --> 13:54.833
It's, um, perfect
for what I needed, so...

13:54.835 --> 13:56.835
(Snoring)

14:04.343 --> 14:05.877
Awesome.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.912
¶¶

14:21.393 --> 14:23.094
(snoring)

14:23.096 --> 14:24.863
Ambitious.

14:30.236 --> 14:33.504
(Alarm blaring)

14:33.506 --> 14:36.574
That's some alarm you got there.

14:36.576 --> 14:39.344
Yeah, I don't even remember
even setting it...

14:39.346 --> 14:41.346
For 11:04.

14:41.348 --> 14:42.881
Weird.

14:45.417 --> 14:48.353
Uh, morning, Megan.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.388
Good morning, Alex.

14:52.124 --> 14:55.293
It's <i> Alec,</i> actually.

14:55.295 --> 14:58.096
Yeah.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.732
What'd I say?
Alex.

15:03.269 --> 15:05.203
Do your way,
one more time.

15:05.205 --> 15:06.471
Alec.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.773
It's got a "c" at the end of it.

15:08.775 --> 15:10.208
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.410
It's okay.
Gotcha, sorry.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.679
Well, um...

15:16.015 --> 15:21.386
I had a blast, so...
Thank you for having me.

15:21.388 --> 15:22.954
You're welcome.

15:22.956 --> 15:25.023
My only concern is how
we're gonna sugarcoat this

15:25.025 --> 15:27.025
when we tell our grandkids
how we met.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.626
(Laughing)

15:28.628 --> 15:30.561
Right?
Yeah.

15:30.563 --> 15:33.298
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.565
So do you wanna grab breakfast

15:34.567 --> 15:36.801
or do you
normally just take off?

15:38.871 --> 15:40.271
Normally?

15:40.273 --> 15:42.340
Huh?

15:42.342 --> 15:43.908
You said, "normally."

15:43.910 --> 15:47.312
Just... like I do this so
much that I'd have a normal

15:47.314 --> 15:49.047
and an abnormal version of it?

15:49.049 --> 15:50.581
That's... yeah, that's
not what I meant.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.984
I have no idea
how often you do this.

15:52.986 --> 15:54.953
I told you last night
that this is my first time

15:54.955 --> 15:58.489
doing anything, you know,
remotely like this.

15:58.491 --> 16:01.125
Yeah, but come on.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.894
Come on.

16:02.896 --> 16:04.429
What?

16:04.431 --> 16:05.863
Megan, do you
expect me to believe

16:05.865 --> 16:08.433
this was your first
one-night stand ever?

16:08.435 --> 16:09.801
Yes!

16:09.803 --> 16:11.469
Yeah, no, I mean, the only
reason that I am here

16:11.471 --> 16:12.937
is because my roommate,

16:12.939 --> 16:14.772
she peer-pressured
the shit out of me.

16:14.774 --> 16:17.175
Yeah, she sexiled you,
or whatever, right?

16:17.177 --> 16:19.444
Exactly, and yet I am sensing

16:19.446 --> 16:21.879
some distinctly judgey vibes

16:21.881 --> 16:23.247
coming from your
side of the bed,

16:23.249 --> 16:26.150
which is odd considering
the team work involved.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.386
There's no judgey vibes coming
from this side of the bed.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.688
Honestly, I really
admire what you did.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.924
I wish more girls were
that forward.

16:32.926 --> 16:33.926
Forward?

16:33.927 --> 16:35.893
There we go
with the slut thing again.

16:35.895 --> 16:37.395
I'm not calling you a slut!

16:37.397 --> 16:39.030
I'm calling you a girl

16:39.032 --> 16:41.032
who went over to a stranger's
house at midnight.

16:41.034 --> 16:44.369
If only there was a word
for someone who does that.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.471
Wow, you know what, screw you.

16:46.473 --> 16:47.805
That was a joke,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16:47.807 --> 16:50.508
You invited me here,
just remember that.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.743
That's not quite how it happened

16:51.745 --> 16:53.111
but it doesn't matter.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.812
Look, can we please
just eat breakfast?

16:54.814 --> 16:56.381
I make oatmeal with
a little smiley face

16:56.383 --> 16:59.584
made out of jelly, and it's
not slutty at all.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.552
You know what,
save your oatmeal.

17:01.554 --> 17:02.820
I think I'm gonna take off.

17:02.822 --> 17:04.555
But, um,
thanks for having me,

17:04.557 --> 17:05.757
it was awesome to get
to know you.

17:05.759 --> 17:07.058
Have a nice life, Alex.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.593
Okay, cool, well,
I'm just gonna assume

17:08.595 --> 17:10.127
that time was on purpose,

17:10.130 --> 17:11.996
'cause I told you my name
is Alec with a "c"

17:11.998 --> 17:14.132
like a dozen times.
It wasn't on purpose,
but don't worry.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.467
You just have
a stupid name.
Okay, cool, well, bye.

17:16.469 --> 17:19.337
It was lovely having
sex with you!
Aw, I wish
I could say the same.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.806
Hmm, sounded like you had a
pretty good time last night.
You know what?

17:21.808 --> 17:23.340
Don't believe
everything you hear.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.343
Especially when it's something
like, "hey, Alec, cool name."

17:25.345 --> 17:26.544
What is that?

17:26.546 --> 17:27.779
It sounds like
the first draft of a name!

17:27.781 --> 17:29.514
Okay, fuck you, Megan.
Fuck you, back.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.916
(Alarm beeping)

17:31.918 --> 17:33.284
Ah, okay.

17:39.525 --> 17:41.059
What?

17:41.061 --> 17:43.061
¶¶

17:43.063 --> 17:44.662
(wind whistling)

17:50.069 --> 17:52.070
Ow, shit!

17:54.173 --> 17:57.742
(Alec)
Imagine a sleeping little
angel-faced angel...

17:57.744 --> 17:59.477
No, I'm the angel.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.879
And this angel is being woken up

18:01.881 --> 18:06.717
by a fucking junkyard dog in
a hot-girl body!

18:06.719 --> 18:08.820
Okay, and that's my morning.

18:08.822 --> 18:11.422
Look, I can't...
uh, mom.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.924
I will call you back.

18:15.494 --> 18:19.330
Hi there,
it's Alec, right?

18:19.332 --> 18:20.631
Hmm...

18:20.633 --> 18:22.633
What is it,
a little snow outside?

18:22.635 --> 18:24.068
Yeah, hmm.

18:24.070 --> 18:25.169
Well, new yorkers...

18:25.171 --> 18:26.571
I don't want to say that you
guys are pussies

18:26.573 --> 18:27.805
but seriously,
you should see what

18:27.807 --> 18:30.608
a winter in Minnesota
looks like.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.176
I'll get you a cab.

18:35.214 --> 18:37.215
(Wind whistling)

18:41.587 --> 18:43.721
Holy shit,
that is a lot of snow!

18:47.426 --> 18:49.260
Hmm.
Hmm.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.962
Hmm.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.263
Wow.

18:52.265 --> 18:53.998
<i>Hey, folks, I hope
you aren't planning</i>

18:54.000 --> 18:55.299
<i>on going anywhere anytime soon</i>

18:55.301 --> 18:56.801
<i>'cause let me tell you
something,</i>

18:56.803 --> 18:58.769
<i>it ain't gonna happen, okay?</i>

18:58.771 --> 19:01.639
<i>We are seeing record snowfalls!</i>

19:01.641 --> 19:03.341
<i>This thing came in overnight</i>

19:03.343 --> 19:07.011
<i>and has New York City
in a total whiteout!</i>

19:07.013 --> 19:09.680
<i>We're talking about
tens of thousands</i>

19:09.682 --> 19:11.949
<i>of stranded holiday travelers.</i>

19:11.951 --> 19:15.253
<i>The entire city transit system
is shut down.</i>

19:15.255 --> 19:17.588
<i>The streets have
not even been ploughed.</i>

19:17.590 --> 19:20.958
<i>The mayor's office is urging
people to stay indoors</i>

19:20.960 --> 19:23.394
<i>and to avoid
all nonessential travel.</i>

19:23.396 --> 19:24.862
<i>So get cozy, folks,</i>

19:24.864 --> 19:27.532
<i>because it's going to
be a long weekend.</i>

19:27.534 --> 19:29.300
Faiza, you have to do something,

19:29.302 --> 19:30.668
I cannot stay here.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.470
This is the worst.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.138
<i>(Faiza)</i>
<i>Sweetie, are you even</i>
<i>watching the news?</i>

19:34.140 --> 19:35.540
<i>There's nothing we can do.</i>

19:35.542 --> 19:37.141
¶¶
see how nice this is?

19:37.143 --> 19:39.143
This could be every day.

19:39.145 --> 19:41.846
But Cedric's an EMT,
can he like...

19:41.848 --> 19:43.915
Helicopter me out
of here or something?

19:43.917 --> 19:44.815
Ha!

19:44.817 --> 19:46.317
<i>(Megan)
Is that Cedric?</i>

19:46.319 --> 19:48.553
Is Cedric laughing at me?
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

19:48.555 --> 19:50.054
Okay, just make the best of it

19:50.056 --> 19:53.357
and we'll rescue you as soon
as we can, okay, I promise.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.593
No, no, no, no,
I would not be here

19:55.595 --> 19:57.895
<i>if you did not slut me out!</i>

19:57.897 --> 19:59.297
Sorry,
I can't hear you.

19:59.299 --> 20:02.099
(Laughing)

20:02.101 --> 20:03.167
What?

20:03.169 --> 20:05.336
I think the snow is
messing with the...

20:05.338 --> 20:07.872
with the sat... satellite.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.140
Okay, bye.
Bye.

20:10.509 --> 20:12.310
(Whispering)
Faiza!

20:12.312 --> 20:13.678
Grab that ass!

20:13.680 --> 20:15.646
(Laughing)

20:15.648 --> 20:18.249
<i>(Rick on TV)</i>
<i>This storm is literally</i>
<i>going to dump</i>

20:18.251 --> 20:20.851
<i>all over the tristate area.</i>

20:20.853 --> 20:23.254
<i>Three to five feet of snow,
maybe more.</i>

20:23.256 --> 20:25.156
<i>In the poconos

20:25.158 --> 20:27.725

12 feet of snow.</i>

20:27.727 --> 20:31.329
<i>It's the biggest blizzard
in the history of the world.</i>

20:31.331 --> 20:33.731
This is what I deserve,
it's penance.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.967
Wow, that is officially
the worst review

20:35.969 --> 20:37.868
my oatmeal has ever received.

20:37.870 --> 20:40.271
It's what I get for
slutting it up.

20:40.273 --> 20:42.540
Um, so you really think
God made this blizzard

20:42.542 --> 20:43.941
to punish you for being slutty?

20:43.943 --> 20:45.409
No, I don't think God did it.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.978
That's ridiculous.

20:46.980 --> 20:49.714
I think my grandmother did,
and I just don't know how.

20:49.716 --> 20:52.483
Right, that makes sense.

20:53.919 --> 20:57.288
Well, I would prefer not
to spend the next 24 hours

20:57.290 --> 20:59.523
in an uncomfortable
silence with you,

20:59.525 --> 21:02.760
so why don't we just pretend
that we never had sex?

21:02.762 --> 21:04.195
It didn't happen.

21:04.197 --> 21:05.830
And then we can pretend
that it's just the weather

21:05.832 --> 21:08.065
and not your passive-aggressive
magical grandma.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.734
No, that's like trying to get

21:09.736 --> 21:12.370
the toothpaste back into
the tube... you can't do it.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.571
It is out there.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.072
I have seen your penis.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.574
You've implied I'm a slut.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.676
Those are big things.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.011
Did you just call my penis big?

21:20.013 --> 21:21.679
Uh, no, no, I did not.

21:21.681 --> 21:23.748
I called the implication
of your penis big.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.916
Well, it's still nice to hear.

21:25.918 --> 21:27.151
You can't just...

21:27.153 --> 21:29.120
Erase the fact
that two people had sex.

21:30.789 --> 21:32.223
I think you underestimate us.

21:38.363 --> 21:39.897
Hi, I'm Alec.

21:42.501 --> 21:43.701
I'm Megan.

21:43.703 --> 21:45.770
Megan, it's very
nice to meet you.

21:45.772 --> 21:47.204
Um, what do you do for a living?

21:47.206 --> 21:49.240
Oh, Jesus, that...
that's what we're doing?

21:49.242 --> 21:50.508
Uh, no.

21:50.510 --> 21:51.709
Seriously, already?

21:51.711 --> 21:52.777
We just started.
Mm-hmm.

Hmm, okay.

Well, now you do.

Okay, I am trying very hard

construed as upsetting.

Perfectly non-upsetting

I like dogs.

23:01.948 --> 23:03.547
Me too.

I have to use the restroom.

23:07.453 --> 23:09.720
That's allowed.

24:27.166 --> 24:28.899
you step away, you are
not cleaning that up.

You will just hold it over
my head, go to your room.

Gross.

(Water running)

24:41.047 --> 24:43.681

It just keeps coming.

24:50.790 --> 24:52.289
Hey, you gotta turn the knob!

24:52.291 --> 24:55.626
No, I mean the punishments
from the universe.

24:55.628 --> 24:58.896
It's a flood,
it's practically biblical.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.464
Where the fuck is your plunger?

25:00.466 --> 25:03.400
It should be right
next to the, um...

25:03.402 --> 25:06.804
Ah, shit, I let my buddy
borrow my plunger, dammit.

25:06.806 --> 25:09.507
That's why you never let your
friends borrow plungers.

25:09.509 --> 25:11.475
There's like a thousand reasons.

25:11.477 --> 25:13.310
Look, just shut the door.

25:13.312 --> 25:16.247
I'll deal with it later.

25:28.627 --> 25:31.228
Hey, I just thought of an idea
that could fix everything.

25:32.264 --> 25:33.664
Do you wanna get high?

(Wind whistling)

25:39.004 --> 25:41.005
Yeah, me neither,
that was just a test.

25:41.007 --> 25:42.640
Didn't know if you were a cop.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.849
Yep, I'm going to do it,
I'm gonna get high.

25:51.851 --> 25:54.018
You don't care, do you?

25:54.020 --> 25:55.786
Your apartment.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.054
I'm warning you though,

25:57.056 --> 25:59.156
you're about to think
that I'm really cool.

25:59.158 --> 26:00.691
My buddy made it.

26:00.693 --> 26:03.360
I don't know if you can tell,
but he smokes a lot of pot.

26:03.362 --> 26:05.596
I try to encourage his
creativity.

26:05.598 --> 26:08.098
No, I think it fits you.

26:10.201 --> 26:12.169
(Bong bubbling)

26:16.308 --> 26:18.542
Sorry, I'd open a window,
but, you know...

26:19.711 --> 26:22.112
It is a mystery why you
don't have a girlfriend.

26:22.114 --> 26:24.715
Hey, I'm a catch.

26:24.717 --> 26:27.217
I'll bet you 150 bucks
you're gonna die alone.

26:27.219 --> 26:29.787
Well, my future
smoking-hot widow

26:29.789 --> 26:31.455
will gladly accept your money.

26:33.725 --> 26:35.492
(Bong bubbling)

26:42.167 --> 26:43.300
Hey, I'm just saying,
you could afford to

26:43.302 --> 26:44.902
take the edge off a little bit.

26:44.904 --> 26:46.070
It could be good for you.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.404
You should embrace it.

26:47.406 --> 26:49.640
I've gotten high before.

26:49.642 --> 26:51.175
Not with me.

26:53.945 --> 26:55.346
Fine.

26:56.915 --> 26:58.415
It better make you funnier.

26:59.651 --> 27:01.685
Yeah, smoke that shit.

27:01.687 --> 27:03.621
(Bong bubbling)

27:05.624 --> 27:07.324
¶¶

27:10.662 --> 27:12.963
So earlier you asked
what I did for a living

27:12.965 --> 27:15.199
and I kinda got a little feisty.

27:15.201 --> 27:16.634
You, feisty?

27:16.636 --> 27:18.168
Can't picture it.

27:18.170 --> 27:21.305
Well, the answer is...

27:23.375 --> 27:27.111
I am less-than-employed
at the moment.

27:27.113 --> 27:28.512
I don't do anything.

27:28.514 --> 27:30.881
See, last year
I was able to say,

27:30.883 --> 27:32.049
"I'm a premed student,"

27:32.051 --> 27:34.952
which sounds kind of
impressive, right?

27:34.954 --> 27:36.987
But then I graduated

27:36.989 --> 27:38.589
and I'm not allowed
to say it anymore.

27:40.558 --> 27:41.859
Um...

27:43.128 --> 27:44.628
I think your profile
said premed student.

27:44.630 --> 27:46.597
Yeah, no, I just
haven't changed it yet.

27:46.599 --> 27:48.999
Didn't you make the profile
like two days ago?

27:49.001 --> 27:50.167
That's weird.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.136
What is this, like an
interrogation?

27:52.138 --> 27:53.871
You got something to hide?

27:53.873 --> 27:56.473
No, I just...

27:56.475 --> 27:58.776
I think I'm just
in that limbo phase.

27:58.778 --> 28:01.912
It's not like your degree
has instructions on it.

28:01.914 --> 28:03.714
Well... boom!

28:03.716 --> 28:06.650
Home run, twins
win the world series!

28:06.652 --> 28:09.787
Well, your degree did
say premed,

28:09.789 --> 28:12.623
so you would think
something follows that.

28:15.894 --> 28:17.895
(Ball grinding)

28:17.897 --> 28:19.997
What was that?

28:19.999 --> 28:21.031
Hmm.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.800
¶¶

28:27.539 --> 28:29.640
So...

28:29.642 --> 28:31.175
Why did you major in premed

28:31.177 --> 28:32.443
if you didn't want to
go into medicine?

28:32.445 --> 28:33.944
I always thought I'd change it,

28:33.946 --> 28:36.013
but then I graduated.

28:36.015 --> 28:37.347
Whoops.

28:37.349 --> 28:39.016
Wait,
how does that happen?

28:39.018 --> 28:41.685
Easier than you would think.

28:41.687 --> 28:43.353
What do you do for a living?

28:43.355 --> 28:46.223
I work at a bank.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.058
Fancy.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.626
Banking.

28:49.628 --> 28:51.061
No, just bank.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.197
I'm an assistant manager.

28:53.199 --> 28:55.899
How does someone like you get
into something that's so...

28:55.901 --> 28:57.201
Wildly exciting?

28:57.203 --> 28:58.635
Yes.
Yes.

28:58.637 --> 29:01.038
I don't know,
I mean, you know, like,

29:01.040 --> 29:02.673
when you're 17 and...

29:02.675 --> 29:04.208
You just want to get out there
and show the world

29:04.210 --> 29:05.576
everything that
you have to offer,

29:05.578 --> 29:07.277
because you have all
this stuff to say?

29:07.279 --> 29:10.914
I don't know
what that feels like.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.316
I don't know.

29:12.318 --> 29:15.285
I never felt like I needed
a job to define my life.

29:15.287 --> 29:16.620
Do you like your job?

29:16.622 --> 29:18.922
Since when are you
supposed to like your job?

29:18.924 --> 29:20.157
I think our generation

29:20.159 --> 29:23.460
catastrophically
misunderstands that.

29:24.829 --> 29:26.597
Interesting.

29:29.901 --> 29:31.769
¶¶

29:35.406 --> 29:37.307
I forgot the food,
I'm going back for it.

29:37.309 --> 29:38.475
Huh?
No, no, no.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.344
Please, allow me.

29:43.715 --> 29:46.817
Now, I am impressed.
Mm-hmm.

29:46.819 --> 29:49.920
'Cause it's like a Butler
that is also a rug.

29:49.922 --> 29:52.456
For the man who has
everything except a rug.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.024
(Chuckling)

29:55.894 --> 29:58.595
You know, I used to
smoke back in college.

29:58.597 --> 30:00.664
But one summer, I walked in
on my parents

30:00.666 --> 30:04.001
smoking out of a vaporizer
and watching Italian porn.

30:04.003 --> 30:05.736
Oh my God.
Which is kind of

30:05.738 --> 30:08.806
the greatest antidrugs
psa of all time.

30:08.808 --> 30:10.440
That is awesome!

30:10.442 --> 30:12.709
Kinda gross, but...

30:12.711 --> 30:15.445
It is funny.
Growing up...

30:15.447 --> 30:19.917
All of my friends' parents
were divorced, you know?

30:19.919 --> 30:23.754
But mine, they were
always... so happy.

30:23.756 --> 30:27.524
They were just
so disgustingly happy.

30:29.627 --> 30:31.428
It's a lot to live up to.

30:33.531 --> 30:35.599
I think it kinda messed me up.

30:41.706 --> 30:44.975
My parents are still
married too.
Yeah?

30:44.977 --> 30:47.244
Good for them.
What?

30:47.246 --> 30:49.112
Yeah, when I was a kid

30:49.114 --> 30:50.714
I used to wish that
they'd get divorced

30:50.716 --> 30:52.216
'cause I was jealous of
all my friends

30:52.218 --> 30:54.685
who got to have two Christmas's.

30:54.687 --> 30:56.854
¶¶

30:56.856 --> 30:59.323
Unh-unh, hm-hm, hm-hm.

30:59.325 --> 31:01.091
What?
You should
turn this off.

31:01.093 --> 31:02.326
You don't like this song?

31:02.328 --> 31:04.795
Oh, no,
I love this song.

31:04.797 --> 31:07.764
It's gonna make me wanna dance.

31:07.766 --> 31:09.533
Yes, you should.

31:09.535 --> 31:10.868
No.
Yes.

31:10.870 --> 31:12.569
Trust me.

31:12.571 --> 31:15.706
Oh, are you like a bad dancer?

31:15.708 --> 31:17.374
Oh, no.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.508
No, no, no.

31:18.510 --> 31:21.912
I am an epic dancer,
but you see...

31:23.615 --> 31:26.083
See, if you see me dance

31:26.085 --> 31:28.986
you'll follow me around
like a little puppy dog

31:28.988 --> 31:31.588
and it'll be
embarrassing for us both.

31:31.590 --> 31:34.725
So you have to stay here.

31:34.727 --> 31:37.361
For your own safety,
trust me on that one.

31:37.363 --> 31:41.064
¶¶

32:28.046 --> 32:30.013
Okay, um...

32:30.015 --> 32:33.116
So I would just like to

32:33.118 --> 32:35.919
frame the next question in
the context that

32:35.921 --> 32:38.622
my diet doesn't
normally consist of junk food.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.657
And with that in mind

32:40.659 --> 32:42.592
hypothetically...
Yeah?

32:42.594 --> 32:49.366
...if one were to need to
make use of a bathroom

32:49.368 --> 32:53.337
how might one do that

32:53.339 --> 32:56.306
in these special circumstances?

32:56.308 --> 32:58.375
Stop smiling.

32:58.377 --> 33:00.510
Uh...

33:00.512 --> 33:03.180
That's actually
a great question.

33:03.182 --> 33:04.681
(Chuckling)

33:05.717 --> 33:07.084
(Knocking on door)

33:07.086 --> 33:08.952
Are these your creepy neighbors?

33:08.954 --> 33:10.787
Are you the creepy neighbor?

33:10.789 --> 33:13.790
You're totally
the creepy neighbor.

33:13.792 --> 33:15.959
Hey, Mrs. lopan,
it's Alec.

33:15.961 --> 33:18.228
I just really need
to borrow your plunger.

33:18.230 --> 33:20.697
It's kind of an emergency.

33:20.699 --> 33:23.266
That wouldn't happen to
be their mailbox, would it?

33:23.268 --> 33:24.468
Oh, yeah, you know what,

33:24.470 --> 33:25.802
they're probably away
for the holidays.

33:25.804 --> 33:28.638
(Chuckling)
You did not just laugh.

33:28.640 --> 33:31.308
It's kind of funny.
Do you see this face?

33:31.310 --> 33:33.010
This is my panic face.

33:33.012 --> 33:34.344
Do we understand?

33:34.346 --> 33:35.379
Yeah.
Okay.

33:35.381 --> 33:36.413
We do.
Good.

33:36.415 --> 33:37.714
Okay, have no fear.

33:37.716 --> 33:39.750
The trusty coat hanger
is here to save the day.

33:39.752 --> 33:43.553
Aw, shucks, I bet you say
that to all the girls.

33:43.555 --> 33:45.655
We're kind of on a clock here.

33:45.657 --> 33:46.790
I mean, there's a plan "b,"

33:46.792 --> 33:48.291
but it might sound
kind of out there.

33:48.293 --> 33:50.627
We are not
getting high again.
Yes, we are.

33:50.629 --> 33:52.195
No, I'm just kidding.

33:52.197 --> 33:53.897
The windows of this building,
they don't really work right.

33:53.899 --> 33:56.466
So we can go out the window,
climb up to the roof

33:56.468 --> 33:57.834
go to the other side

33:57.836 --> 34:00.871
and then get in through
the lopans' fire escape.

34:00.873 --> 34:01.972
Okay.

34:06.444 --> 34:08.844
Maybe just you should do this.

34:08.847 --> 34:10.547
I'm not breaking
and entering alone!

34:10.549 --> 34:12.309
The whole reason we're doing
this is for you.

34:16.154 --> 34:17.387
Why do you have that?

34:17.389 --> 34:18.989
My grandmother left it to me.

34:18.991 --> 34:21.358
Yup, all style complaints
go to her.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.627
I see, mm-hmm, sweet.

34:24.962 --> 34:26.929
¶¶

34:33.971 --> 34:35.672
(wind whistling)

34:37.275 --> 34:38.275
Let's do this.

34:38.277 --> 34:40.643
¶¶

34:54.125 --> 34:56.626
You couldn't just
shit in the sink, huh?!

34:58.429 --> 35:00.030
What's wrong?!

35:00.032 --> 35:02.032
It's frozen shut!

35:02.034 --> 35:03.633
It won't budge!

35:03.635 --> 35:05.402
We gotta go back.

35:05.404 --> 35:07.504
There is no turning back!

35:07.506 --> 35:09.106
Whoa!

35:09.108 --> 35:10.841
What the fuck?!
Go, go, go!

35:10.843 --> 35:12.642
Are you kidding me?

35:14.612 --> 35:16.279
Hey, are you fucking insane?

35:16.281 --> 35:18.782
I'm going to have to
pay for that!
I had to!

35:18.784 --> 35:20.750
They will totally understand.

35:20.752 --> 35:22.819
Look, you are a ruiner.

35:22.821 --> 35:24.955
I am not a ruiner!

35:26.057 --> 35:27.924
Sorry, I gotta pee, I had to.

35:27.926 --> 35:30.093
You understand,
you understand.
No, no, no, no, no...

35:31.129 --> 35:34.431
You are an asshole
in so many languages!

35:34.433 --> 35:36.032
You understand.

35:37.535 --> 35:39.369
Oh yeah,
this pee feels so good.

35:42.773 --> 35:44.141
(Exhaling)

35:53.451 --> 35:55.452
Whoops, sorry,
false alarm.

35:55.454 --> 35:56.920
Oh, yeah?

36:03.628 --> 36:05.228
Oh, God...

36:05.230 --> 36:07.164
¶¶

36:29.921 --> 36:31.288
Just so you know,

36:31.290 --> 36:34.691
I'm giving you
the silent treatment too.

36:34.693 --> 36:35.926
I just didn't know
if you could tell

36:35.928 --> 36:37.360
and I wanted you to know.

36:43.301 --> 36:45.435
(Water splashing)

36:49.840 --> 36:51.675
Hey, I think we've
solved the mystery

36:51.677 --> 36:53.043
of the clogged toilet.

36:53.045 --> 36:54.878
(Megan)
Wait, what?

36:54.880 --> 36:56.580
No, I told you I would do that!

36:56.582 --> 36:58.114
What is this?
No, it's nothing.

36:58.116 --> 37:00.116
What are you doing?
That's gross.
Give it back.

37:00.118 --> 37:03.753
Megan, this was in a toilet,
that's gross, okay?

37:03.755 --> 37:04.955
If you had a problem
with the reading material

37:04.957 --> 37:06.890
you could have just said
something.

37:15.700 --> 37:18.034
¶¶

37:18.036 --> 37:19.336
It's just some stupid article.

37:22.640 --> 37:24.708
It wasn't stupid,
though.

37:24.710 --> 37:27.110
It was spot-on.

37:27.112 --> 37:31.081
How pathetic is that,
it's so pathetic...

37:37.855 --> 37:39.055
Do you really think my name

37:39.057 --> 37:41.091
sounds like
the first draft of a name?

37:47.164 --> 37:48.765
Yeah.

37:50.368 --> 37:52.836
Like a good
first draft, you know?

37:52.838 --> 37:54.504
Like it's really close.

37:59.577 --> 38:01.411
And did you really fake it?

38:04.081 --> 38:05.615
What are you talking about?

38:05.617 --> 38:07.751
Last night.

38:07.753 --> 38:09.919
You know, when you were making

38:09.921 --> 38:11.254
what I would describe as like

38:11.256 --> 38:12.522
banshee-esque screams of
pleasure,

38:12.524 --> 38:13.823
and then this morning,

38:13.825 --> 38:16.159
you called into question
their authenticity?

38:16.161 --> 38:17.827
So...

38:17.829 --> 38:20.297
What happened to like,
"hey, let's just pretend

38:20.299 --> 38:21.931
we never had sex?"

38:21.933 --> 38:23.566
Yeah, I'm over that.

38:23.568 --> 38:26.102
Why are you even
thinking about this again?

38:26.104 --> 38:28.305
I haven't stopped
thinking about it.

38:30.975 --> 38:35.045
Oh, all right, well, see,
I just said those things

38:35.047 --> 38:36.313
to hurt your feelings

38:36.315 --> 38:38.048
because you hurt mine, you know?

38:38.050 --> 38:39.783
Yeah, I don't really buy
that because I think women

38:39.785 --> 38:41.051
are most honest actually
when they're trying

38:41.053 --> 38:42.619
to hurt somebody's feelings.

38:42.621 --> 38:44.454
Fine.

38:44.456 --> 38:45.889
But this can't be the first time

38:45.891 --> 38:47.624
that a woman's faked it for you.

38:47.626 --> 38:49.959
Uh, definitely was.

38:49.961 --> 38:51.261
You made your ex come, huh?

38:51.263 --> 38:53.396
Mm-hmm, yep,
pretty much all the time.

38:53.398 --> 38:54.364
Yeah, that often?

38:54.366 --> 38:58.335
And did she come
before or after you?

38:58.337 --> 39:00.570
Usually we...

39:00.572 --> 39:02.739
We would come simultaneously.

39:02.741 --> 39:04.140
At the same time.
Yeah, yeah?

39:04.142 --> 39:05.342
I'm telling you,
it's true.
Bullshit.

39:05.344 --> 39:06.543
That's mean.

39:06.545 --> 39:08.478
No, it's nothing to
be ashamed of either,

39:08.480 --> 39:10.280
it's really hard to do.

39:10.282 --> 39:12.082
For guys it's so easy,
it's just, you know,

39:12.084 --> 39:13.783
it's just friction.

39:13.785 --> 39:17.687
But for girls there's a whole
lot of intangibles down there.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.622
And it's bad that we fake it.

39:19.624 --> 39:22.058
It's not good for you,
it doesn't help us.

39:22.060 --> 39:24.060
It doesn't help the next girl.

39:24.062 --> 39:26.396
Oh, but you're a really
great kisser.

39:26.398 --> 39:28.465
Yeah, you've got
that down pat, it's just...

39:28.467 --> 39:30.667
Practice on my
hand a lot.
...the other stuff.

39:30.669 --> 39:31.935
A lot.
But I had a good time.

39:31.937 --> 39:33.837
Okay.

39:33.839 --> 39:35.839
Well, yeah,
let's talk about this.

39:35.841 --> 39:37.874
So, what, uh...

39:37.876 --> 39:40.877
Yeah, what did I do wrong?

39:40.879 --> 39:42.779
Okay, it's not about
what you did wrong,

39:42.781 --> 39:45.482
it's just how people sync up.

39:45.484 --> 39:47.217
You know, how they fit together.

39:47.219 --> 39:49.519
Mm-hmm, and we
didn't sync up well?

39:49.521 --> 39:50.920
Do you think we did?

39:50.922 --> 39:52.188
Well, you know, it's the first
time, it's awkward.

39:52.190 --> 39:53.356
You don't know what to say,

39:53.358 --> 39:55.024
you don't know
what you're touching.

39:55.026 --> 39:56.559
It's awkward.

39:56.561 --> 40:00.563
It's not like that changes
after the first time.

40:00.565 --> 40:02.932
Well, I mean eventually

40:02.934 --> 40:06.102
they learn what
you like more, but...

40:06.104 --> 40:07.504
You can never talk
about it openly

40:07.506 --> 40:10.106
'cause guys are so sensitive.

40:10.108 --> 40:13.843
Suggesting just the tiniest
thing and it freaks them out

40:13.845 --> 40:16.679
because then they think you've
been thinking that every time,

40:16.681 --> 40:18.815
and then they get mad that you
didn't say something earlier

40:18.817 --> 40:20.116
and you didn't
say something early

40:20.118 --> 40:21.551
because it would have
been too soon.

40:21.553 --> 40:23.319
So the only thing
that there is to do

40:23.321 --> 40:25.221
is train them to recognize
different levels of moans

40:25.223 --> 40:27.557
without them
realizing you're doing it.

40:27.559 --> 40:29.492
In my experience.

40:31.562 --> 40:32.829
Wow.

40:32.831 --> 40:34.731
It works.

40:34.733 --> 40:36.266
Or maybe it's just me.

40:36.268 --> 40:38.067
No, it's like camp,
you know?

40:38.069 --> 40:39.769
You go and you have to do
this activity with a partner

40:39.771 --> 40:41.171
but you can't say anything

40:41.173 --> 40:42.739
so you're just kinda stumbling
your way through it.

40:42.741 --> 40:45.475
Yeah, it's just like camp.

40:45.477 --> 40:47.744
What camp did you go to?
Holy shit.

40:47.746 --> 40:49.312
I just had a great idea.

40:49.314 --> 40:52.549
Do you feel it,
the two of us?

40:52.551 --> 40:54.918
It's a pretty good
opportunity right now.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.085
What... what is?

40:56.087 --> 40:58.688
This... right here.

40:58.690 --> 41:00.356
I'm not...
You don't get it?

41:00.358 --> 41:02.559
Okay, look, listen to me,
so we're trapped.

41:02.561 --> 41:04.961
We're like this incredible
experiment right now,

41:04.963 --> 41:06.362
we're lab rats.

41:06.364 --> 41:08.064
We've had sex, but we
don't have feelings

41:08.066 --> 41:09.499
for each other, right?

41:09.501 --> 41:11.501
And as soon as that
snow clears, you're gone.

41:11.503 --> 41:12.936
Like Mexico-gone.

41:12.938 --> 41:14.571
We don't know any
of the same people,

41:14.573 --> 41:17.307
so we're probably never going
to see each other again.

41:17.309 --> 41:18.675
Yes.

41:18.677 --> 41:20.877
So we can use this time to
be honest with each other,

41:20.879 --> 41:22.312
and we can
give each other advice

41:22.314 --> 41:24.581
and constructive criticism
to make each other

41:24.583 --> 41:25.782
better lovers

41:25.784 --> 41:26.916
for the next
person that comes along.

41:26.918 --> 41:28.384
(Giggling)

41:28.386 --> 41:31.754
Okay, firstly, you cannot
pull off the word "lovers."

41:31.756 --> 41:33.122
I think I can.

41:33.124 --> 41:35.658
Secondly, what you are
proposing is potentially...

41:35.660 --> 41:37.293
it's a horrible... it sucks.

41:37.295 --> 41:38.995
It's a bad idea...
don't... what?
Are you kidding me?

41:38.997 --> 41:41.498
This is the best
idea I've ever had!
That's so sad!

41:41.500 --> 41:43.533
Look, Megan, listen,

41:43.535 --> 41:45.368
you can't just like
drop a bomb on me like,

41:45.370 --> 41:46.736
"hey, maybe you've never made

41:46.738 --> 41:48.338
a girl come in your
entire fucking life,"

41:48.340 --> 41:49.906
and then say you don't
want to talk about it.

41:49.908 --> 41:51.441
I wanna talk.

41:51.443 --> 41:55.078
Guys can't handle constructive
criticism about that stuff.

41:55.080 --> 41:56.479
You'll get all pissy...

41:56.481 --> 41:57.947
no.

41:57.949 --> 42:01.317
I promise you that I will not
get pissy if you don't.

42:01.319 --> 42:03.052
What do you mean if I don't?

42:03.054 --> 42:04.487
Oh, did you think
this was just like

42:04.489 --> 42:06.189
a one-way street,
or something?

42:06.191 --> 42:07.824
You think you
have pointers for me?

42:07.826 --> 42:09.325
Well...

42:09.327 --> 42:12.095
Yeah, a thing or two
crossed my mind, but...

42:12.097 --> 42:15.732
I guess you'll never
know, will you?

42:18.168 --> 42:20.336
Jesus, fine,
all right, I bite, go.

42:20.338 --> 42:22.105
Okay, great,
this is good.

42:22.107 --> 42:24.741
Now, this is not just you.

42:24.743 --> 42:26.342
I want to make that clear.

42:26.344 --> 42:28.177
Um, okay, the lights-off
thing.

42:28.179 --> 42:29.579
What the fuck is that?

42:29.581 --> 42:31.514
If the lights are off,
like you requested

42:31.516 --> 42:33.216
and I so gentlemanly obliged,

42:33.218 --> 42:35.518
I could be having sex with
anything, literally.

42:35.520 --> 42:37.921
But I don't want to be
having sex with anything.

42:37.923 --> 42:40.256
I wanna be having sex with you.

42:40.258 --> 42:42.692
Not you specifically,
but like the universal you.

42:44.762 --> 42:46.429
Lights on?

42:46.431 --> 42:47.297
Wow.

42:47.299 --> 42:48.831
All guys feel that way?

42:48.833 --> 42:51.067
I can only speak for me
and my friends, but yeah.

42:51.069 --> 42:53.036
Duh, girls hear that
more than hello.

42:53.038 --> 42:54.304
That's what you got?

42:54.306 --> 42:56.239
All I'm saying
is that we're young

42:56.241 --> 42:58.541
and we're hot-looking people,

42:58.543 --> 43:00.710
and we should embrace
that shit while we have it.

43:00.712 --> 43:01.945
All right, fine!

43:01.947 --> 43:03.913
Guys like to do it
with the lights on.

43:03.915 --> 43:06.282
Noted, awesome,
shocked.

43:06.284 --> 43:07.617
What else you got?
Do you want more?

43:07.619 --> 43:09.218
Do you have more?
Yeah, I do.

43:09.220 --> 43:11.487
Okay, um...

43:11.489 --> 43:13.256
What else do you
do that I don't like?

43:13.258 --> 43:15.224
Okay, yeah, you do this thing

43:15.226 --> 43:16.726
where you stand up from the bed

43:16.728 --> 43:18.928
and you kind of
turn halfway around

43:18.930 --> 43:21.965
and then you get undressed
as fast as you can all at once

43:21.967 --> 43:23.099
and it's like you're
getting ready

43:23.101 --> 43:24.867
for a physical or something.

43:24.869 --> 43:27.236
I have never had any complaints
about how rapidly I undress.

43:27.238 --> 43:29.806
Most guys like naked me.
I love naked you.

43:29.808 --> 43:32.442
Naked you is awesome
to look at and touch.

43:33.577 --> 43:35.278
What I mean is that
you could make

43:35.280 --> 43:39.415
the getting-naked-there
part a little like...

43:39.417 --> 43:41.417
What's up?
Boop.

43:41.419 --> 43:43.853
Then you take
your bra off the side.

43:43.855 --> 43:45.822
You could even imaginary pole,

43:45.824 --> 43:47.490
just bring it, smack it.

43:47.492 --> 43:48.958
Bring it down...
oh God!

43:48.960 --> 43:50.259
Bring it up.

43:50.261 --> 43:52.295
Do the little ass thing
with your underwear.

43:52.297 --> 43:55.632
"Hey, I dropped
something, my panties."

43:55.634 --> 43:56.733
You can flick it up.

43:56.735 --> 43:58.001
You could catch it.

43:58.003 --> 43:59.202
Then I don't care
what you do with it.

43:59.204 --> 44:00.670
Actually
that wasn't terrible.

44:00.672 --> 44:03.306
You should put on heels
and try it.

44:03.308 --> 44:04.941
Yeah, you're right,
this is weird.

44:04.943 --> 44:08.111
No, no, no,
man-up, finish.

44:08.113 --> 44:09.846
Just get ready for an onslaught.

44:09.848 --> 44:11.748
Okay, that definitely didn't
sound like it was in the vein

44:11.750 --> 44:14.951
of constructive criticism but
I will continue, nonetheless.

44:14.953 --> 44:17.587
Look, all...

44:17.589 --> 44:22.692
I'm saying is that
guys like undressing.

44:22.694 --> 44:26.462
And you could make it
more of a... thing.

44:26.464 --> 44:28.231
Okay.
Okay.

44:28.233 --> 44:30.233
Lastly, when I was
inside of you,

44:30.235 --> 44:32.335
you started doing this thing...

44:32.337 --> 44:33.836
you started helping yourself
a little bit

44:33.838 --> 44:38.908
and it kind of made me feel
like I was being benched.

44:38.910 --> 44:40.510
Second string.
Noted.

44:40.512 --> 44:42.145
Okay.
Duly noted.

44:42.147 --> 44:43.780
Is it my turn?
Yeah.

44:43.782 --> 44:45.081
Don't ever do that.

44:45.083 --> 44:46.249
Okay.

44:46.251 --> 44:47.517
That's the international thing.

44:47.519 --> 44:49.519
Okay, I don't know
who first taught guys

44:49.521 --> 44:52.488
to do the "alphabet with
their tongue" thing,

44:52.490 --> 44:55.491
but it kind of makes me
feel like I'm Helen Keller

44:55.493 --> 44:57.894
being fucked by her teacher.

44:57.896 --> 45:00.897
And that is not
a fantasy of yours?

45:00.899 --> 45:03.533
There was a moment,
one moment during foreplay

45:03.535 --> 45:05.802
in which I was maybe
close to coming.

45:05.804 --> 45:08.204
And I believe I subtly
pointed this out for you.

45:08.206 --> 45:10.239
Do you remember what it
was that I said?

45:10.241 --> 45:12.341
"I'm close to coming."
Yes, uh-huh.

45:12.343 --> 45:13.743
And then after I said that,

45:13.745 --> 45:15.378
you switched up
what you were doing.

45:15.380 --> 45:18.081
Just what was your thought
process there?

45:18.083 --> 45:19.816
Um, I mean, honestly,

45:19.818 --> 45:21.384
I thought I was doing
like a finishing move.

45:21.386 --> 45:22.752
Kind of like
a "mortal kombat" thing like,

45:22.754 --> 45:23.754
"finish her!"

45:23.755 --> 45:25.354
And like really hit it, but...

45:25.356 --> 45:26.656
I thought I was
doing something like that.

45:26.658 --> 45:27.557
It's not...

45:27.559 --> 45:28.925
Next time,
just, you know,

45:28.927 --> 45:31.360
keep on doing what it was
that you were doing

45:31.362 --> 45:33.463
because you got her to third

45:33.465 --> 45:35.798
and you can get her home.

45:35.800 --> 45:37.066
Okay.

45:37.068 --> 45:39.802
You waited for me to undress
you, which is unnecessary

45:39.804 --> 45:41.604
and also a little weird

45:41.606 --> 45:43.673
because I'm not your mom
tucking you into bed.

45:43.675 --> 45:45.041
You kept trying
to give me hickeys,

45:45.043 --> 45:47.043
which nobody likes.

45:47.045 --> 45:48.444
Oh, and you went
like way too fast,

45:48.446 --> 45:51.080
like you were drilling
me for oil.

45:51.082 --> 45:54.550
You know, like my whole body
was like, "zzhh-zzhh-zzhh..."

45:54.552 --> 45:56.586
And then... oh, oh, you did
find my g-spot,

45:56.588 --> 45:58.387
but kind of like
a drive-by, which was cool,

45:58.389 --> 46:01.090
but then you kept going.

46:01.092 --> 46:03.392
And I so wanted you to stop.

46:03.394 --> 46:05.328
Oh, okay, all right.

46:05.330 --> 46:07.964
When a girl is helping herself,

46:07.966 --> 46:09.398
that's a good fucking thing.

46:09.400 --> 46:12.235
My ex was weird about
that too, and it's...

46:12.237 --> 46:14.871
it's not like
we're competing on some

46:14.873 --> 46:17.340
awesome erotic Japanese
game show;

46:17.342 --> 46:19.876
we are having sex.

46:19.878 --> 46:23.412
You know, like,
embrace the team spirit.

46:23.414 --> 46:25.414
Oh, and last night,
when we were done,

46:25.416 --> 46:26.682
you retreated to
the other side of the bed

46:26.684 --> 46:29.452
like you planted a bomb
down there.

46:29.454 --> 46:33.489
So next time,
just hold the girl,

46:33.491 --> 46:35.792
count to like ten.

46:35.794 --> 46:37.994
It'd go a long way, that one.

46:37.996 --> 46:39.595
You can thank me later.

46:39.597 --> 46:41.430
Other than those things,

46:41.432 --> 46:43.966
you were a perfectly
adequate lover.

46:43.968 --> 46:45.968
Adequate,
wow, thank you.

46:49.173 --> 46:50.840
Adequate's not really...

46:50.842 --> 46:53.109
See, I knew
this would happen.
...a compliment.

46:53.111 --> 46:55.444
I told you this
was a bad idea.
That's cool.

46:55.446 --> 46:57.847
It's a fine idea,
I'm good.

46:57.849 --> 47:00.917
I'm like teflon,
baby, nothing sticks to me.

47:00.919 --> 47:03.219
We should totally check out
the news though

47:03.221 --> 47:04.620
for some updates.

47:04.622 --> 47:06.656
<i>As you can see,
this storm is showing</i>

47:06.658 --> 47:08.925
<i>no signs of slowing down!</i>

47:08.927 --> 47:10.626
<i>I want you to look at something.</i>

47:10.628 --> 47:13.629
<i>Behind me is
the empire state building,</i>

47:13.631 --> 47:15.331
<i>but you can't see it.</i>

47:15.333 --> 47:18.000
<i>All you can
see is snow.</i>

47:18.002 --> 47:19.502
I bet you a 150 bucks

47:19.504 --> 47:21.304
Rick Raines is
fully erect right now.

47:21.306 --> 47:22.772
(Chuckling)

47:22.774 --> 47:25.074
<i>It's like an incredible
disappearing act...</i>

47:25.076 --> 47:26.642
That's funny.

47:26.644 --> 47:29.378
<i>Okay, I'm hearing that
that's actually not where</i>

47:29.380 --> 47:33.950
<i>the empire state building is,
but it does show you the...</i>

47:33.952 --> 47:35.751
Is it cool
if I take a shower?

47:35.753 --> 47:37.220
No.

47:37.222 --> 47:38.387
Yes, it's fine.

47:38.389 --> 47:41.157
The towels are...
On the floor.

47:41.159 --> 47:44.694
<i>Reporting from the streets of
New York City, I'm Rick Raines.</i>

47:49.900 --> 47:51.701
(Water running)

48:12.990 --> 48:15.024
<i>I just got off the phone
with the governor's office</i>

48:15.026 --> 48:17.960
<i>and they told me this storm
is a real motherfucker...</i>

48:17.962 --> 48:19.195
That was quick.

48:19.197 --> 48:20.596
<i>I can't say that, okay.</i>

48:21.965 --> 48:23.165
What if we tried again?

48:24.368 --> 48:25.868
I can't take any more critiques.

48:25.870 --> 48:28.838
No, no, I mean,
what if we...

48:28.840 --> 48:30.406
Tried again.

48:32.409 --> 48:36.212
Tested our theories for science.

48:36.214 --> 48:39.081
¶¶

48:39.083 --> 48:40.483
For...

48:42.953 --> 48:45.021
...science.

48:45.023 --> 48:47.657
Yeah, I think it would be
really helpful for me.

48:47.659 --> 48:50.826
Because I'm more
of a hands-on learner.

48:52.796 --> 48:55.932
Yeah, we could...
we could do that.

48:55.934 --> 48:57.099
Good.

48:57.101 --> 48:58.567
Okay.

48:58.569 --> 49:01.971
And the channel of
communication stays open.

49:01.973 --> 49:03.239
Mm-hmm.

49:03.241 --> 49:05.241
We say whatever's on
our mind, that's the deal.

49:05.243 --> 49:07.576
Okay, we should
film it.
Hmm.

49:07.578 --> 49:09.979
No?
Too far?

49:09.981 --> 49:13.149
Sorry.

49:13.151 --> 49:15.518
How should we start?

49:15.520 --> 49:18.621
Okay, so normally,
on date situations,

49:18.623 --> 49:20.289
there would be more of
a build-up here, right,

49:20.291 --> 49:22.425
but since this is strictly
a hookup scenario

49:22.427 --> 49:24.460
I think it'd be
fine if you just...

49:36.173 --> 49:37.807
it's not bad.

49:49.786 --> 49:50.987
Whoa.

50:01.665 --> 50:03.799
Uh, shit.
Okay, see, the lack of sheets

50:03.801 --> 50:05.634
kind of makes it look
a little crack den-y.

50:05.636 --> 50:07.536
Which is great for like a
role-playing scenario but...

50:07.538 --> 50:09.672
yeah, it was
laundry day.
Mm-hmm.

50:12.209 --> 50:14.944
Okay, get over here.

50:14.946 --> 50:15.978
Okay.

50:15.980 --> 50:17.880
They should label it
or something, right?

50:17.882 --> 50:20.683
I think it's inside out
actually, but it's fine.

50:20.685 --> 50:22.718
That's good,
yeah, where were we?
Good, right here.

50:27.491 --> 50:28.657
Oh.

50:28.659 --> 50:30.059
Ah, a fan of the bed push.

50:30.061 --> 50:31.193
That's a classic.

50:31.195 --> 50:33.162
Oh, no, no, no,
shoes and socks first.

50:33.164 --> 50:35.998
There's never a good time
for it so, you know...

50:36.000 --> 50:37.066
Get them off.

50:37.068 --> 50:38.601
Oh, God.

50:44.941 --> 50:46.442
Good compromise.

50:46.444 --> 50:48.511
I like that.
Thank you.

50:48.513 --> 50:51.147
I'm like the un of doing it.

51:54.311 --> 51:56.145
Is that sort of
what you had in mind?

51:57.347 --> 51:59.248
Yeah, that's good.

51:59.250 --> 52:01.417
That's pretty good, you got
the hang of that, mm-hmm.

52:01.419 --> 52:02.618
Good.

52:02.620 --> 52:04.620
¶¶

52:20.370 --> 52:22.304
I have sensitive nipples.

52:24.708 --> 52:26.342
That one is really sensitive.

52:32.449 --> 52:34.083
Any notes?
No.

52:42.792 --> 52:44.460
(Blowing raspberry)

52:44.462 --> 52:46.695
No!

52:46.697 --> 52:49.165
If there is one thing
that you take away

52:49.167 --> 52:51.800
from this whole
experience... never.

52:51.802 --> 52:53.002
Sorry, I was trying to
cool you off.

52:53.004 --> 52:54.436
My dad used to give me those.

52:54.438 --> 52:56.338
And now I am just
thinking about my dad.

52:56.340 --> 52:58.340
Ew, that's gross,
I'm sorry.

53:05.649 --> 53:06.949
That's better.

53:10.520 --> 53:12.688
That is... much better.

53:16.359 --> 53:17.760
Japanese alphabet.

53:19.429 --> 53:21.197
Thank you,
rosetta stone.

53:35.178 --> 53:37.213
(Alec)
Holy shit!
(Megan)
That was awesome!

53:49.025 --> 53:50.226
Hey.

53:51.494 --> 53:52.895
Up and at 'em.

53:56.733 --> 53:58.133
Wake up.

54:00.003 --> 54:01.403
Hey.

54:01.405 --> 54:03.806
We fell asleep.

54:03.808 --> 54:06.475
Yeah, is that a problem?

54:06.477 --> 54:08.210
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

54:08.212 --> 54:10.813
I don't see what the
educational purposes of it are.

54:14.884 --> 54:16.385
Plus, I'm hungry.

54:20.757 --> 54:22.658
Um...
We're gonna starve.

54:22.660 --> 54:24.293
Not if you like mustard.

54:25.662 --> 54:26.795
Why don't you have food?

54:26.797 --> 54:28.297
Well, I had food,

54:28.299 --> 54:30.799
and then we ate it all
when we were really high.

54:30.801 --> 54:32.868
Oh, yeah.

54:35.071 --> 54:36.405
Three-year-old banana?

54:38.775 --> 54:40.175
Oh, here we go.

54:43.113 --> 54:46.215
¶¶

54:47.484 --> 54:49.451
This might have to last days.

54:50.687 --> 54:52.321
We'll ration it.
Okay.

54:57.961 --> 54:59.395
This is good.

54:59.397 --> 55:01.096
All right, we just
need to get creative.

55:01.098 --> 55:03.432
Give me like... give me
ten minutes,

55:03.434 --> 55:05.834
I'll figure
something out.
Okay, but don't hog.

55:05.836 --> 55:07.102
All right, you wanna
go back to bed?

55:07.104 --> 55:08.804
Let me figure it out.

55:20.550 --> 55:22.151
Special delivery.

55:28.191 --> 55:30.559
Where did you
get these?
Hmm?

55:30.561 --> 55:31.994
Don't worry about it.

55:34.664 --> 55:37.733
These are your
neighbors' noodles!

55:37.735 --> 55:40.069
These are contraband noodles.

55:40.071 --> 55:41.970
You threw such
a hissy fit about the window

55:41.972 --> 55:45.441
and now look at you...
you are a common thief.

55:45.443 --> 55:47.476
I know.

55:47.478 --> 55:48.844
And, for the record,

55:48.846 --> 55:50.512
I actually thought it
was pretty badass

55:50.514 --> 55:52.348
when you broke
that window like that.

55:52.350 --> 55:55.117
Thank you, I did too.

56:06.029 --> 56:07.596
You might not
be the worst person

56:07.598 --> 56:09.298
in the world to be stuck with.

56:10.533 --> 56:11.867
Right back at you.

56:14.704 --> 56:16.472
So were your parents doctors?

56:16.474 --> 56:17.474
Mm-mm.

56:17.475 --> 56:18.874
Oh, I thought maybe they were

56:18.876 --> 56:20.175
and that's why you rebelled

56:20.177 --> 56:22.745
and didn't
want to do it anymore.

56:22.747 --> 56:25.447
So what happened?
It doesn't matter.

56:27.917 --> 56:30.419
Yeah, it does,
come on, you can tell me.

56:30.421 --> 56:32.721
It wouldn't even
make sense to you.

56:32.723 --> 56:34.056
Everything makes sense to me.

56:34.058 --> 56:36.024
It's the burden of
being a genius.

56:36.026 --> 56:37.960
I can't help it.

56:37.962 --> 56:39.294
(Scoffing)

56:41.464 --> 56:42.998
It's not, um...

56:44.134 --> 56:46.435
It's not that I stopped
wanting to be a doctor.

56:46.437 --> 56:48.971
So you do want to be a doctor.

56:52.108 --> 56:55.144
No, I meant
I didn't change my mind.

56:55.146 --> 56:57.513
I <i> never</i> wanted to be
a doctor, ever... ugh.

56:57.515 --> 57:00.349
Then why would you
go into premed?

57:00.351 --> 57:02.084
Okay, um...

57:04.354 --> 57:07.122
So...

57:07.124 --> 57:11.927
I was engaged once.

57:11.929 --> 57:13.128
(Whispering)
Once.

57:13.130 --> 57:14.897
Sounds like
I'm writing a memoir.

57:14.899 --> 57:18.967
Um, I was engaged recently.

57:18.969 --> 57:21.236
We dated through high school,

57:21.238 --> 57:22.738
followed him to nyu.

57:22.740 --> 57:26.408
When I had to
pick a major, I, uh...

57:26.410 --> 57:30.145
I never actually planned
on needing it.

57:30.147 --> 57:32.681
I just wanted to
be a wife and a mom.

57:37.754 --> 57:39.087
See, people always
look at you funny

57:39.089 --> 57:40.389
when you say something that

57:40.391 --> 57:42.357
'cause they feel bad
for you, or they...

57:42.359 --> 57:44.193
Megan, I'm not...
I'm sorry, I wasn't

57:44.195 --> 57:47.262
trying to look
at you funny.
No, it's fine.

57:47.264 --> 57:50.466
You're missing out
on something, but...

57:50.468 --> 57:51.967
Oh.

57:51.969 --> 57:55.270
I don't know, I mean...

57:55.272 --> 57:57.272
It worked for my parents

57:57.274 --> 57:59.341
and I always thought that
I'd do the same.

58:02.111 --> 58:04.646
And then the universe
called my bluff.

58:04.648 --> 58:06.515
What happened?

58:06.517 --> 58:08.016
He cheated.
Oh.

58:08.018 --> 58:12.120
Yeah, and sadly that
wasn't even the deal-breaker.

58:12.122 --> 58:15.691
I wanted to work through
it, but he...

58:15.693 --> 58:17.125
Wanted out.

58:17.127 --> 58:19.528
He said that he wanted to
find a girl with

58:19.530 --> 58:21.129
more of her own life.

58:21.131 --> 58:23.932
Dropped the word "ambition"
a few times.

58:23.934 --> 58:28.504
Ooh, yeah, I've had that word
thrown at me a few times too.

58:28.506 --> 58:29.671
Believe it or not.

58:29.673 --> 58:31.206
I believe it.

58:31.208 --> 58:33.609
Ambition is such bullshit.

58:33.611 --> 58:36.345
Seriously, it's just chasing
vapor, like...

58:36.347 --> 58:38.347
Whatever it is that
you think that you need

58:38.349 --> 58:40.482
like that job or that gold star,

58:40.484 --> 58:42.918
blue ribbon,
fancy desk, nice office,

58:42.920 --> 58:44.319
like it doesn't...

58:44.321 --> 58:45.988
like once you get that,
you're gonna be confused

58:45.990 --> 58:47.456
because you're not gonna
be as happy

58:47.458 --> 58:49.258
as you thought
you were going to be.

58:49.260 --> 58:50.759
Then you're going to be
sitting there being like,

58:50.761 --> 58:51.894
"why aren't I happy?

58:51.896 --> 58:53.262
I have this...
I got the desk."

58:53.264 --> 58:54.830
Because, man, there's
another desk.

58:54.832 --> 58:56.665
Like there's always
going to be something more

58:56.667 --> 58:57.933
that your ambition is telling
you that you need

58:57.935 --> 58:59.468
so it's the next thing,

58:59.470 --> 59:00.736
and then when you get that,
there's another thing.

59:00.738 --> 59:01.837
It's an endless cycle.

59:01.839 --> 59:02.905
You're forced into retirement.

59:02.907 --> 59:04.206
You're kicking and screaming.

59:04.208 --> 59:05.507
The next thing you know,
you're in a big house,

59:05.509 --> 59:07.009
you've got four-and-a-half
bathrooms,

59:07.011 --> 59:08.544
you don't even
have a ping-pong table

59:08.546 --> 59:09.444
and you're dead.

59:09.446 --> 59:11.013
Let's fucking go blow shit up!

59:11.015 --> 59:12.247
Like you're dead.

59:12.249 --> 59:14.383
I just blacked out for a second.

59:15.418 --> 59:17.052
Thank you for
staying with me on that,

59:17.054 --> 59:19.388
I didn't know if I was going to
come out the other side.

59:19.390 --> 59:22.624
Blowing up stuff always helps.

59:23.860 --> 59:25.861
So what happened with that guy?

59:25.863 --> 59:28.196
Nothing.

59:28.198 --> 59:32.768
A semester later
I graduated with a degree

59:32.770 --> 59:35.237
I had no intention of using.

59:37.974 --> 59:39.675
And here I am.

59:39.677 --> 59:42.477
So you've really never had
a one-night stand before?

59:42.479 --> 59:44.580
I have told you this
like 100 times.

59:44.582 --> 59:46.822
Well, you should know, they
usually don't last this long.

59:47.817 --> 59:49.751
Well, that's a bummer.

59:51.454 --> 59:52.654
Wow.

59:54.958 --> 59:56.725
That guy is so screwed.

59:56.727 --> 59:58.060
What do you mean?

59:58.062 --> 59:59.394
You said that he met you
in high school, right?

59:59.396 --> 01:00:00.696
Mm-hmm.

01:00:00.698 --> 01:00:03.699
So, he thinks that you're
a certain type of girl,

01:00:03.701 --> 01:00:05.934
and he thinks that he will meet

01:00:05.936 --> 01:00:09.004
that same type of girl later
in his life when he's ready.

01:00:09.006 --> 01:00:11.173
But... when he's ready,

01:00:11.175 --> 01:00:13.642
that girl's
not going to be there.

01:00:13.644 --> 01:00:15.844
He has no idea how rare you are.

01:00:19.415 --> 01:00:21.149
What are those?
What?

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:24.353
Those?

01:00:24.355 --> 01:00:26.555
You're giving me
googly-eyes.

01:00:26.557 --> 01:00:29.758
You totally are,
you're giving me googly-eyes!

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:32.094
I'm just really
thirsty right now,

01:00:32.096 --> 01:00:33.295
so those are my thirsty eyes.

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:34.529
You look thirsty too.

01:00:34.531 --> 01:00:36.365
I'm going to get us some drinks.

01:00:48.011 --> 01:00:49.478
Can I pull a classic girl move

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:52.280
and confiscate your biggest,
comfiest sweatshirt?

01:00:52.282 --> 01:00:54.783
And I promise,
I will not steal it.

01:00:54.785 --> 01:00:56.318
Yeah, one sec.

01:00:58.021 --> 01:01:00.188
¶¶

01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:17.205
(whispering)
Please be a cross-dresser.

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:35.791
(Alec)
I found some
peach schnapps.

01:01:35.793 --> 01:01:37.192
The bottle was a little
dusty but I think

01:01:37.194 --> 01:01:40.195
the liquor
is still... good.

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:48.704
So where's Daisy?

01:01:51.274 --> 01:01:52.741
San Francisco.

01:01:56.779 --> 01:01:58.213
You're with her?

01:02:00.116 --> 01:02:02.284
That's a tough
question to answer.

01:02:04.253 --> 01:02:05.887
No, it's not.

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:09.858
See?
You just did.

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:11.526
Megan, here.

01:02:11.528 --> 01:02:12.994
Look, let's talk about this.

01:02:12.996 --> 01:02:15.530
You have the place to
yourself, and, boy...

01:02:15.532 --> 01:02:17.399
Do you make the most of it.

01:02:19.035 --> 01:02:21.269
When does she get back?

01:02:21.271 --> 01:02:22.370
She was supposed to
get back this afternoon

01:02:22.372 --> 01:02:25.273
but her flight got canceled.

01:02:26.542 --> 01:02:28.710
I heard about that.

01:02:28.712 --> 01:02:31.446
Apparently there's this
huge fucking blizzard.

01:02:37.653 --> 01:02:40.455
You know, I always wondered
what it would be like

01:02:40.457 --> 01:02:43.658
to be the other girl.

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:46.428
It feels better.

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:48.296
Not great,
but undeniably better.

01:02:51.234 --> 01:02:52.601
Hold on.

01:02:59.575 --> 01:03:01.309
Thank God, it stopped.

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:05.814
¶¶

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:10.786
<i>(Rick on TV)</i>
<i>Let's take a look at some of</i>
<i>the outside stuff.</i>

01:03:10.788 --> 01:03:12.888
<i>We're looking at
the New Jersey transit</i>

01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:15.524
<i>making local stops
all day long.</i>

01:03:15.526 --> 01:03:17.192
<i>Here in menlo park...</i>

01:03:17.194 --> 01:03:18.326
Can I show you something?

01:03:18.328 --> 01:03:21.363
Please
just leave me alone.

01:03:21.365 --> 01:03:23.799
I'm not mad.

01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:25.167
How can I be?

01:03:25.169 --> 01:03:26.434
I didn't ask and you didn't lie.

01:03:26.436 --> 01:03:29.805
I wanted meaningless sex
and I got it.

01:03:29.807 --> 01:03:32.641
Let me show you this.

01:03:32.643 --> 01:03:33.875
Please.

01:03:35.678 --> 01:03:36.878
Read.

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:43.051
So she dumped you but
you still live with her?

01:03:43.053 --> 01:03:44.452
She didn't give it to me yet.

01:03:44.454 --> 01:03:45.787
I don't understand.

01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:47.656
And honestly,
I don't care.

01:03:47.658 --> 01:03:50.392
Three weeks ago she asked
me to look for her wallet

01:03:50.394 --> 01:03:51.893
and when I was
looking for her wallet

01:03:51.895 --> 01:03:54.329
I accidently found this.

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:56.231
I didn't know what to do.

01:03:56.233 --> 01:03:57.566
So I gave her her wallet
back at lunch

01:03:57.568 --> 01:04:00.135
and then the next
day she left for tour.

01:04:00.137 --> 01:04:01.970
Tour?
What is she, like...

01:04:01.972 --> 01:04:03.905
she's a dj.

01:04:03.907 --> 01:04:05.273
Of course.

01:04:05.275 --> 01:04:08.143
Of course, she's like the
coolest girl imaginable.

01:04:08.145 --> 01:04:09.711
I made that profile because

01:04:09.713 --> 01:04:12.314
I wanted to have something
to throw in her face

01:04:12.316 --> 01:04:15.317
whenever she
wanted to pull the trigger.

01:04:15.319 --> 01:04:17.319
And I know that's very immature.

01:04:17.321 --> 01:04:19.254
You could have
broken up with her.

01:04:19.256 --> 01:04:21.323
Yeah.

01:04:21.325 --> 01:04:23.058
Yeah, I thought about that.

01:04:24.393 --> 01:04:27.028
People talk about how
great it is to be single

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:29.197
and that's bullshit,

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:30.565
joining the single party.

01:04:30.567 --> 01:04:32.200
It's not a party, it's a bunch
of people

01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:34.669
sitting around
in the dark, texting.

01:04:34.671 --> 01:04:36.404
<i>Your complaints about how slow
the plowing</i>

01:04:36.406 --> 01:04:38.907
<i>is going in outer boroughs
such as queens and Brooklyn</i>

01:04:38.909 --> 01:04:40.675
<i>are not falling on deaf ears.</i>

01:04:40.677 --> 01:04:42.510
<i>And we're hearing from
the sanitation department</i>

01:04:42.512 --> 01:04:44.012
<i>that they're getting that done
right away.</i>

01:04:44.014 --> 01:04:47.182
And I did something
stupid, and I'm sorry.

01:04:47.184 --> 01:04:48.817
<i>... report that
the subways and buses</i>

01:04:48.819 --> 01:04:50.085
<i>are starting to run,
as well.</i>

01:04:50.087 --> 01:04:51.486
Excuse me.

01:04:53.022 --> 01:04:57.926
<i>Most of the storm is pushed up
into the shenandoah valley...</i>

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.668
(Sobbing)

01:05:22.551 --> 01:05:24.786
(Truck beeping)

01:05:30.026 --> 01:05:31.092
(Alec)
Megan, wait.

01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:32.761
Hey...

01:05:32.763 --> 01:05:34.863
Come on, I didn't...
what was I supposed to do?

01:05:34.865 --> 01:05:37.565
I didn't even know that
you existed, I don't...

01:05:37.567 --> 01:05:39.501
look, I don't
want her, I want you.

01:05:39.503 --> 01:05:41.736
I want you.

01:05:41.738 --> 01:05:45.040
And what makes you
think that I want you?

01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:49.477
You're just some funny guy
that works at a bank.

01:05:49.479 --> 01:05:50.979
I think you
severely overestimate

01:05:50.981 --> 01:05:52.948
your ability to break hearts.

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:01.489
Come on.

01:06:05.261 --> 01:06:08.163
¶¶

01:06:49.105 --> 01:06:50.405
Oh my God, Megan!

01:06:50.407 --> 01:06:52.073
Hey.

01:06:52.075 --> 01:06:54.075
Hey.

01:06:54.077 --> 01:06:55.543
Is that my duvet?

01:06:55.545 --> 01:06:57.078
Hi.

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.781
Oh, God.

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:03.785
You guys
are monsters.
God!

01:07:05.354 --> 01:07:06.788
How was your date?

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:12.193
¶¶

01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:03.812
You looked so tired
I wanted to let you sleep.

01:08:03.814 --> 01:08:07.115
Hey, what are you...
Doing?

01:08:07.117 --> 01:08:09.617
Daisy,
we should talk.
Yeah, I know.

01:08:09.619 --> 01:08:10.952
I found the note in the trash.

01:08:10.954 --> 01:08:13.088
I have the note right here.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.568
When did you find this?

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:28.203
Um, when I was
looking for your wallet.

01:08:30.272 --> 01:08:31.606
By accident.

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:33.975
I see what's going on here.

01:08:33.977 --> 01:08:36.377
You read this, and then you
wanted me to come home

01:08:36.379 --> 01:08:40.048
and find this slutty
little lipstick haiku

01:08:40.050 --> 01:08:42.117
so that you could be the one
that ended us.

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:45.220
It's not a haiku,
there's not enough syllables.

01:08:45.221 --> 01:08:46.955
You are a child.

01:08:46.957 --> 01:08:49.357
Yeah.

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:51.059
Look, Daisy, we both know

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:52.926
that we weren't
right for each other.

01:08:52.929 --> 01:08:54.529
And I think we both knew that
for a long time,

01:08:54.531 --> 01:08:56.930
but it's fine.

01:08:56.933 --> 01:08:58.299
We were just scared
that the perfect person

01:08:58.301 --> 01:08:59.968
wasn't out there for us.

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:03.671
And what if they're not?

01:09:03.673 --> 01:09:05.173
I think they are.

01:09:09.478 --> 01:09:11.813
Okay, so what now?

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:14.649
I can move my stuff
over to Kevin's place.

01:09:14.651 --> 01:09:17.986
He owes me for a plunger.

01:09:17.988 --> 01:09:20.721
Okay.

01:09:20.724 --> 01:09:22.189
Let me know when you're out.

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:25.960
Hey, Daisy...

01:09:25.962 --> 01:09:28.062
Can I ask you something?

01:09:28.064 --> 01:09:29.363
Yeah.

01:09:29.366 --> 01:09:31.232
Did you ever...

01:09:31.234 --> 01:09:33.368
Fake it?

01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:34.801
Wow.

01:09:34.804 --> 01:09:36.970
A year together.

01:09:36.973 --> 01:09:38.273
Done.

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:40.207
And that's what you're
thinking about right now?

01:09:40.210 --> 01:09:42.343
No, I'm thinking of all
kinds of stuff right now.

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:46.281
I'm thinking of memories
and feelings and...

01:09:46.283 --> 01:09:50.919
But I just need to
know if... did you do that?

01:09:52.587 --> 01:09:55.223
Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:09:55.225 --> 01:09:56.991
I got lazy.

01:09:56.993 --> 01:09:58.226
But you shouldn't have faked it.

01:09:58.228 --> 01:10:00.361
Okay, because
that's not helping anybody.

01:10:00.363 --> 01:10:02.030
You gotta communicate.

01:10:02.032 --> 01:10:03.698
What happened to you?

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.740
(Door closing)

01:10:20.416 --> 01:10:23.017
Tell her, talk to her.

01:10:23.019 --> 01:10:25.086
Megan, faiza has something
she wants to tell you.

01:10:25.088 --> 01:10:26.187
Okay.

01:10:27.356 --> 01:10:28.790
Listen, normally
I'd wait to bring this up

01:10:28.792 --> 01:10:30.558
until after you'd
recovered a bit,

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:33.094
but Cedric and I sort of enjoyed

01:10:33.096 --> 01:10:35.930
having the place to ourselves
the past couple nights.
We did.

01:10:35.932 --> 01:10:38.132
And I wasn't sure that we would,

01:10:38.134 --> 01:10:41.903
'cause I am so used to you
always being here, you know?

01:10:41.905 --> 01:10:46.174
Like... nonstop,
all the time.

01:10:46.176 --> 01:10:49.344
Um, but...
baby, help me out, please.

01:10:49.346 --> 01:10:50.979
Yeah, basically we were
just thinking,

01:10:50.981 --> 01:10:52.347
what if you moved out,

01:10:52.349 --> 01:10:54.549
you know, like what
would that be like?

01:10:54.551 --> 01:10:55.917
And you have to understand,

01:10:55.919 --> 01:10:57.218
you can stay here as
long as you need,

01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:58.653
until you get on your feet.

01:10:58.655 --> 01:10:59.921
A couple of days,
three days...

01:10:59.923 --> 01:11:02.323
However long you want.

01:11:02.325 --> 01:11:04.359
Four days.
Okay.

01:11:05.594 --> 01:11:07.195
No, I think...

01:11:07.197 --> 01:11:08.630
I think it's a really good idea.

01:11:08.632 --> 01:11:11.199
You do?
She says she does.

01:11:11.201 --> 01:11:14.202
Look, I only moved to New York
because of Chris.

01:11:14.204 --> 01:11:16.604
And I thought
that if I went home

01:11:16.606 --> 01:11:18.806
it would just be admitting that.

01:11:18.808 --> 01:11:20.275
So I stayed

01:11:20.277 --> 01:11:23.011
and made sure that
the Internet wasn't lonely.

01:11:23.013 --> 01:11:24.846
I needed a kick in the ass.

01:11:26.382 --> 01:11:28.416
Cool, so do you know
what you're gonna do?

01:11:28.418 --> 01:11:29.617
No.

01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:31.586
No, I have no fucking clue.

01:11:31.588 --> 01:11:34.756
No idea, unh-unh.

01:11:34.758 --> 01:11:36.224
Do you know what this means?

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:40.361
That this is our last
new year's Eve

01:11:40.363 --> 01:11:41.496
as roommates.

01:11:45.768 --> 01:11:47.168
Awesome.

01:11:48.404 --> 01:11:51.005
Yeah, hey, so I realize this
is probably word-for-word

01:11:51.007 --> 01:11:52.607
something that
a crazy person would say,

01:11:52.609 --> 01:11:56.110
but I met a girl on your
website a few nights ago and...

01:11:56.112 --> 01:11:58.179
<i>(woman)</i>
<i>I think I can save us</i>
<i>both some time here.</i>

01:11:58.181 --> 01:12:00.014
Yeah, no, no, no, I don't
need her address or anything,

01:12:00.016 --> 01:12:01.449
I just need to know
her last name.

01:12:01.451 --> 01:12:02.650
<i>I'm sure it was magical,</i>

01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:04.218
<i>but we cant give our
customers'</i>

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:06.954
<i>personal information to
anyone other than the police.</i>

01:12:06.956 --> 01:12:08.423
<i>So, provided you're
not a cop,</i>

01:12:08.425 --> 01:12:12.327
<i>is there anything else
I can help you with today?</i>

01:12:12.329 --> 01:12:13.394
Nope.

01:12:14.863 --> 01:12:17.265
¶¶

01:12:24.473 --> 01:12:26.874
(man)
It's not just
a show for kids.

01:12:26.876 --> 01:12:28.309
Anybody can get into it.

01:12:28.311 --> 01:12:30.878
You know, it's for anybody
who cherishes

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:33.014
friendship, adventure.

01:12:33.016 --> 01:12:35.516
There's this one character,
her name is applejack,

01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:37.018
she's my favorite.

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:38.920
She's such a fireplug.

01:12:38.922 --> 01:12:41.956
She kind of reminds me
of you, actually.

01:12:41.958 --> 01:12:42.990
I think I lost you there.

01:12:42.992 --> 01:12:44.192
Excuse me?
Hello?

01:12:44.194 --> 01:12:45.693
I'm just going to
put this out here,

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:48.830
but you're kind of a fucking
terrible conversationalist.

01:12:48.832 --> 01:12:50.164
I don't
know if... if ever...

01:12:50.166 --> 01:12:53.201
I think it's
because you are so...

01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:58.306
...captivating.

01:12:58.308 --> 01:13:01.008
I am just intimidated
as fuck... whoo.

01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:02.910
Oh, no, there's
nothing to be scared of.

01:13:02.912 --> 01:13:04.946
Excuse me.
No, no, no,
please, please.

01:13:04.948 --> 01:13:06.881
Godammit!

01:13:08.717 --> 01:13:11.319
Okay, yeah,
all right, great.

01:13:11.321 --> 01:13:12.487
Son of a motherfucking bitch!

01:13:12.489 --> 01:13:14.589
Motherfucking
son of a fucking bitch!

01:13:14.591 --> 01:13:16.657
Fuck!

01:13:16.659 --> 01:13:19.761
<i>(Rick on TV)</i>
<i>And now is the moment you've</i>
<i>all been waiting for...</i>

01:13:19.763 --> 01:13:21.629
(Party horn blowing)

01:13:21.631 --> 01:13:23.498
<i>Whoo!</i>

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.266
(Party horn blowing)

01:13:27.836 --> 01:13:29.237
Megan.

01:13:31.707 --> 01:13:34.575
Long time no see.

01:13:34.577 --> 01:13:37.445
It's Ben.

01:13:37.447 --> 01:13:39.947
From bio class?

01:13:39.949 --> 01:13:41.149
How are you here?

01:13:41.151 --> 01:13:43.651
Do you know faiza?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:13:43.653 --> 01:13:45.052
I'm good buddies with Cedric.

01:13:45.054 --> 01:13:46.120
We're going to get more booze.

01:13:46.122 --> 01:13:48.289
Have fun you two!

01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:53.628
You!

01:13:53.630 --> 01:13:55.930
You are the dumb,
pretty guy!

01:13:55.932 --> 01:13:57.965
Oh...

01:13:57.967 --> 01:14:00.435
Uh, thank you?

01:14:00.437 --> 01:14:01.836
Mh-hmm.

01:14:01.838 --> 01:14:04.105
I was supposed to bang you.

01:14:04.107 --> 01:14:08.109
This is the universe
correcting itself... oops.

01:14:11.547 --> 01:14:13.948
So where'd you decide
on med school?

01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:17.585
Just a surprise, I got
into both my top choices

01:14:17.587 --> 01:14:19.754
but now I'm simply just
trying to decide.

01:14:19.756 --> 01:14:21.556
It's a big decision and...

01:14:21.558 --> 01:14:23.991
and obviously
my dad has opinions...

01:14:23.993 --> 01:14:26.494
Megan, Megan?

01:14:26.496 --> 01:14:27.929
You know, it's just...
Shh, shh...

01:14:27.931 --> 01:14:29.397
Police!
Megan?

01:14:29.399 --> 01:14:31.165
Megan, right?

01:14:31.167 --> 01:14:34.101
Any noise complaints
go to faiza or to Cedric,

01:14:34.103 --> 01:14:36.404
because this is their
apartment now.

01:14:36.406 --> 01:14:39.240
Actually they're
asking for you specifically.

01:14:41.844 --> 01:14:43.277
What's up, dog?

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.980
Megan pagano?

01:14:45.982 --> 01:14:48.683
You wanna step in
the hall with us?

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:52.987
Why?

01:14:54.823 --> 01:14:57.592
Officers found this in
the lopans' bathroom.

01:14:57.594 --> 01:14:58.993
You don't understand.

01:14:58.995 --> 01:15:01.562
This guy is a psychopath.

01:15:01.564 --> 01:15:03.197
He's setting me up!

01:15:03.199 --> 01:15:05.066
He is setting
this whole thing up!

01:15:05.068 --> 01:15:07.001
Which I realize

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:09.136
is exactly what
a crazy person would say

01:15:09.138 --> 01:15:11.305
but that explains my situation.

01:15:11.307 --> 01:15:16.410
He is so crazy that he is
forcing me to sound crazy.

01:15:16.412 --> 01:15:19.146
Do you see what he's doing?
Ma'am...

01:15:19.148 --> 01:15:21.315
Did you, or did you not,

01:15:21.317 --> 01:15:22.917
break in through the window of

01:15:22.919 --> 01:15:25.019
Mr. and Mrs. lopan's
apartment?

01:15:28.457 --> 01:15:32.026
You, um...
You got a little...

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:34.695
Some...

01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:36.430
Okay, got it.

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:39.767
Pretty.

01:15:43.238 --> 01:15:45.039
(Lock buzzing)

01:15:46.508 --> 01:15:48.376
Which one of you is
Megan pagano?

01:15:50.045 --> 01:15:51.946
You made bail.

01:15:51.948 --> 01:15:54.115
Wait, that's...
that's impossible.

01:15:54.117 --> 01:15:56.617
I haven't even made
a phone call yet.

01:15:56.619 --> 01:15:58.119
(Alec)
She can do that?

01:15:58.121 --> 01:15:59.787
She can refuse my bail?

01:15:59.789 --> 01:16:01.188
Are you serious?

01:16:01.190 --> 01:16:04.358
Okay, look, I just...
I need to talk to her.

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:06.594
You can only visit during
visiting hours,

01:16:06.596 --> 01:16:10.431
and if, and only if,
the person wants to see you.

01:16:10.433 --> 01:16:13.100
Which I'm gonna guess she
doesn't, being that she would

01:16:13.102 --> 01:16:15.770
rather remain locked in jail
than see your face.

01:16:15.772 --> 01:16:17.371
Wow... rude.

01:16:17.373 --> 01:16:19.707
Uh, okay, well,
what if I told you that

01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:21.409
I helped her break into
that apartment?

01:16:21.411 --> 01:16:24.979
Then would you
lock me up with her?

01:16:24.981 --> 01:16:27.582
Yeah, that's how
police stations work.

01:16:30.319 --> 01:16:32.119
Are you being
sarcastic?
Are you serious?

01:16:32.121 --> 01:16:33.754
I need to talk to her!

01:16:33.756 --> 01:16:35.456
Oh, okay then.

01:16:36.491 --> 01:16:40.962
(Crowd)
Five, four, three, two, one!

01:16:40.964 --> 01:16:43.764
Happy new year!

01:16:43.766 --> 01:16:46.767
¶¶

01:16:59.815 --> 01:17:01.282
(dog barking)

01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:09.724
(Lock buzzing)

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.494
How about these two?

01:17:13.496 --> 01:17:15.529
Are they special enough
to post your bail?

01:17:15.531 --> 01:17:17.798
Oh my God,
what happened?

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.667
Just take me home.

01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:21.535
Here.

01:17:21.537 --> 01:17:22.870
Hey.

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.641
Who is that?
I'm sorry.

01:17:26.643 --> 01:17:27.975
But I didn't
know your last name.

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:29.043
What was I supposed to do?

01:17:29.045 --> 01:17:30.678
Literally anything but this!

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.580
Okay, you're upset,
but, Megan,

01:17:32.582 --> 01:17:34.949
you felt something
and I felt something.

01:17:34.951 --> 01:17:36.617
What I felt was
Stockholm syndrome.

01:17:36.619 --> 01:17:38.753
Hey, hey, I can't let you
walk out another door

01:17:38.755 --> 01:17:41.155
without listening to me.

01:17:43.325 --> 01:17:45.026
Why are you doing this?

01:17:45.028 --> 01:17:46.127
You have a girlfriend.

01:17:46.129 --> 01:17:47.194
That's over now.

01:17:47.196 --> 01:17:48.996
Look, Megan,
hey, let me explain.

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:50.665
I should have told you
about her, and there were

01:17:50.667 --> 01:17:52.066
times last night I wanted to
tell you about her

01:17:52.068 --> 01:17:53.367
and I should have,

01:17:53.369 --> 01:17:54.802
but there was
other times last night

01:17:54.804 --> 01:17:57.805
that I forgot that other
people even existed.

01:17:57.807 --> 01:17:59.473
And I know that sounds
stupid, 'cause your friends

01:17:59.475 --> 01:18:01.976
are staring at me like my
fucking dick is hanging out.

01:18:01.978 --> 01:18:03.511
(Chuckling)

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:06.681
I'm sorry,
it was funny.

01:18:06.683 --> 01:18:07.815
Sir?

01:18:07.817 --> 01:18:09.150
Okay,
let's wrap this up.

01:18:09.152 --> 01:18:10.685
The cop's not happy,
let's keep the cop happy.

01:18:10.687 --> 01:18:11.952
Megan?

01:18:11.954 --> 01:18:13.220
You put me in jail!
(Whispering)
I'm sorry.

01:18:13.222 --> 01:18:14.889
For like criminals!

01:18:14.891 --> 01:18:18.359
He's got about five seconds
before he finds out firsthand.

01:18:18.361 --> 01:18:19.994
Okay, fine, fuck, shit.

01:18:19.996 --> 01:18:24.165
Uh, look, not directed at you,
and not directed at you.

01:18:24.167 --> 01:18:25.433
(Chuckling)

01:18:25.435 --> 01:18:27.802
Look, I messed up.

01:18:27.804 --> 01:18:31.005
I messed up, but I am
really, really sorry.

01:18:31.007 --> 01:18:33.007
But you can't stop us
before we even realize

01:18:33.009 --> 01:18:34.175
what we could be.

01:18:34.177 --> 01:18:36.444
And we should figure
that out, maybe...

01:18:36.446 --> 01:18:37.812
Maybe we hang out

01:18:37.814 --> 01:18:40.047
and we realize
we don't like each other.

01:18:40.049 --> 01:18:43.751
Maybe you're very intimidated
by my dancing,

01:18:43.753 --> 01:18:46.954
or maybe I find out
you're like...

01:18:46.956 --> 01:18:48.456
Really racist.

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:51.559
Okay, that
was a hypothetical.

01:18:51.561 --> 01:18:54.662
Look, all I'm saying is that
there's a lot of stuff

01:18:54.664 --> 01:18:56.363
that I don't know about you

01:18:56.365 --> 01:18:58.833
and there's a lot
that we need to talk about.

01:18:58.835 --> 01:19:01.368
I spent two nights with you,

01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:03.304
and that's not enough time.

01:19:06.641 --> 01:19:08.409
Give me more time,
please.

01:19:10.746 --> 01:19:12.213
(Cedric)
It was a little shaky
in the middle

01:19:12.215 --> 01:19:13.247
but he finished strong.

01:19:13.249 --> 01:19:14.915
I'm touched.

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:17.251
Megan,
what do we think?

01:19:20.655 --> 01:19:22.890
I think you put me in jail.

01:19:22.892 --> 01:19:23.991
We're still on that?

01:19:23.993 --> 01:19:25.326
Look,
hey, hey, come on.

01:19:25.328 --> 01:19:27.561
Some day you're gonna
laugh about this.

01:19:27.563 --> 01:19:29.130
I promise that
you're gonna find this

01:19:29.132 --> 01:19:31.432
all very funny some day.

01:19:32.834 --> 01:19:34.401
Okay, let's make a deal.

01:19:34.403 --> 01:19:38.072
You give me your number,
and leave.

01:19:38.074 --> 01:19:40.307
And the minute I laugh about it,

01:19:40.309 --> 01:19:41.909
I'll let you know.

01:20:08.336 --> 01:20:10.437
(Officer)
Stay as long as you want.

01:20:10.439 --> 01:20:11.939
That guy was nuts.

01:20:17.445 --> 01:20:19.079
Can I hang out
with him?
Cedric!

01:20:19.081 --> 01:20:21.649
I'm just saying, I don't
meet a lot of funny people.

01:20:21.651 --> 01:20:23.851
Okay, funny people don't
drive ambulances.

01:20:28.924 --> 01:20:30.891
(Laughing)

01:20:34.996 --> 01:20:36.964
¶¶

01:20:40.869 --> 01:20:42.837
Shit.

01:20:42.839 --> 01:20:44.872
¶¶

01:20:47.042 --> 01:20:48.309
<i>(Alec)
Hello?</i>

01:20:48.311 --> 01:20:49.577
You are kind of an idiot,

01:20:49.579 --> 01:20:51.145
do you realize
that about yourself?

01:20:51.147 --> 01:20:52.713
You good?

01:20:52.715 --> 01:20:54.448
<i>Yeah, I've heard that.</i>

01:20:54.450 --> 01:20:56.116
You know that was all me, right?

01:20:56.118 --> 01:20:57.785
No, it was not.
What the fuck are you
talking about?

01:20:57.787 --> 01:20:59.186
It was.

01:20:59.188 --> 01:21:00.855
...do you think in the spirit
of constructive criticism,

01:21:00.857 --> 01:21:02.356
the next time you
wanna win a girl back

01:21:02.358 --> 01:21:03.757
after doing something stupid,

01:21:03.759 --> 01:21:06.393
like practice your speech,
or something

01:21:06.395 --> 01:21:09.196
for the next girl, because...

01:21:09.198 --> 01:21:12.700
I'm gonna be honest...
yours just fucking sucked!

01:21:12.702 --> 01:21:15.536
Shit, it was... I was
embarrassed for you...

01:21:23.511 --> 01:21:26.280
mm-mm.
Mm, mm, what?

01:21:26.282 --> 01:21:27.715
It's way too soon.

01:21:29.184 --> 01:21:31.285
Way too soon.
That's fair.

01:21:31.287 --> 01:21:32.887
That's totally fair.

01:21:35.991 --> 01:21:38.626
¶¶

01:21:43.031 --> 01:21:44.698
Okay, I'm sorry that
I put you in jail,

01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:45.933
but have you thought
about what that's

01:21:45.935 --> 01:21:47.134
going to do for
your street cred?

01:21:47.136 --> 01:21:48.402
Yeah, of course, I have,

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:49.837
that was like the first
thing I thought of.

01:21:49.839 --> 01:21:51.805
Gonna get that shit tattooed.

01:21:51.807 --> 01:21:53.374
And you don't
have to worry about

01:21:53.376 --> 01:21:55.943
the lopans pressing charges
'cause I took care of 'em.

01:21:55.945 --> 01:21:57.945
Did you
murder the lopans?
It had to be done.

01:21:57.947 --> 01:21:59.313
You did it without me?
Mm-hmm.

01:21:59.315 --> 01:22:01.215
Ahh...

01:22:01.217 --> 01:22:02.917
I think I'm ready
for that kiss now.

01:22:02.919 --> 01:22:04.051
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:22:10.558 --> 01:22:13.594
You taste like prison.

01:22:13.596 --> 01:22:16.764
Is it really
snowing again?
Oh, yeah.

01:22:16.766 --> 01:22:20.567
Look at 'em, a million tiny,
little matchmakers.

01:22:20.569 --> 01:22:22.436
Thank you, snowflakes.

01:22:23.672 --> 01:22:26.840
So...
Your place or mine?

01:22:26.842 --> 01:22:28.976
I don't have a place anymore.

01:22:30.578 --> 01:22:32.246
Me neither.

01:22:32.248 --> 01:22:35.115
You are a catch.

01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:36.417
So are you.

01:22:36.419 --> 01:22:38.686
