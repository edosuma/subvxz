[ Police Radio Chatter]
What do you think
there, Bones?

05:44.261 --> 05:48.254
I would surmise that the body
went into the lake before
it froze, then the lake froze,

05:48.349 --> 05:52.058
then the body ﬂoated up
and became attached
to the bottom of the ice.

05:52.144 --> 05:55.728
- I meant, was he murdered?
- Oh. Um, maybe.

05:55.814 --> 06:00.308
Could’ve been...
an accident or a suicide, except—

06:01.654 --> 06:04.066
- You shouldn’t do that.
- It itches, okay?

06:04.156 --> 06:06.488
Yeah, well, except for what?

06:06.575 --> 06:10.568
Trauma to the left maxillary orbit
suggests violence.

06:10.663 --> 06:13.029
- It’s kind of gross, what you’re doing.
- Gross?

06:13.123 --> 06:15.079
You got your finger
in some guy’s maxillary orbit.

06:15.167 --> 06:17.579
I don’t think there’s anything
else to be learned here, so...

06:17.670 --> 06:19.661
let’s get this Popsicle back to the lab.

06:19.755 --> 06:23.623
- Hey, look at that. Bones made a joke.
- Well, I can be quite amusing.

06:26.428 --> 06:29.465
- Wait a second.
- Booth, you aren’t wearing any gloves.

06:32.977 --> 06:37.186
Bones, I— Remember that guy I punched out
last month during my hockey game?

06:38.357 --> 06:40.518
Pete Carlson?
Yes, when you broke
yourhand.

06:40.609 --> 06:42.474
That’s him.

06:46.115 --> 06:49.699
I’m a suspect. Here.

07:30.909 --> 07:34.242
Given that Agent Booth
is curren t/y the prime suspect
in this murder—

07:34.371 --> 07:37.613
Uh, we don’t know it’s murder.
Huh, look at that.
I’m the prime suspect.

07:37.708 --> 07:40.996
Agent Payton Perotta here will
be working with Dr. Brennan.

07:41.086 --> 07:43.668
I won’t work the case
without Booth.

07:43.756 --> 07:45.838
In that case, | invite Agent Booth’s
continued participation—

07:45.924 --> 07:49.087
in the background
as an adviser.

07:49.178 --> 07:51.089
Agent Payton Perotta
has earned bachelor’s degrees...

07:51.180 --> 07:53.341
in both forensic science
and criminology.

07:53.432 --> 07:57.141
Well, anything short ofa doctorate
is virtually useless at my level.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.718
- [Caroline] How would you
like to proceed, darlin’?
- Well, it’s pretty obvious.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.555
We definitely wanna interrogate
the primary suspect, right?

08:02.650 --> 08:04.231
[Quietly]
Yep.

08:09.073 --> 08:11.029
Based on decomp,
I’d put time of death...

08:11.116 --> 08:13.107
at about five days
prior to freezing.

08:13.202 --> 08:15.284
Local cops say the lake
froze over three weeks ago.

08:15.371 --> 08:17.282
Aside from some dormant
Anopheles mosquito larvae,

08:17.373 --> 08:19.204
I imagine whatever the water
from the lake tells us,

08:19.291 --> 08:20.872
it’ll be through a microscope.

08:20.959 --> 08:24.326
If Booth is a suspect,
then I should be too.
This guy scrambled my brains.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.673
Your alibi is that
you were seeing double...

08:26.757 --> 08:28.839

b y your mother.

08:28.926 --> 08:32.168
I’ll get on the fluid samples you took
from the lungs and esophagus.

08:32.262 --> 08:35.174
Could be the vic was drowned somewhere
else and then dumped in the lake.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.472
No. Drowning’s not the way
Booth would kill someone.

08:38.560 --> 08:41.017
Not... that I actually...

08:41.105 --> 08:43.596

Who initiated the fight?
It was hockey.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.870
So it was
spontaneous combustion?

09:00.958 --> 09:03.119
The guy hit two of my players.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.825
The ref— he didn’t catch that.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.251
And that made you angry.

09:06.338 --> 09:08.169
Not angry enough, you know,

09:08.257 --> 09:10.213
to chase him down
after the game and kill him.

09:10.342 --> 09:14.130
Where’d you go after the game?
Uh, Bones drove me and Wendell
to the hospital.

or the next?

I had no intention ofasking.

09:25.941 --> 09:30.355
/s it your contention that, uh,
your argument with the victim
was constrained to the ice?

09:30.487 --> 09:32.819
That is my contention.
Mmm.

- No.

- No. I did not, Agent Perotta.

your experience as the child
ofan abusive alcoholic...

to violence?

have that under control?

11:54.923 --> 11:58.131
This is Pete’s apartment.
He wasn’t the best housekeeper.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.880
Miss Withers, was Mr. Car/son
up-to-date on his rent?

12:00.971 --> 12:03.804
Ah, good question.
Great start.

12:03.891 --> 12:07.884
Uh, yes, most/y—
500 bucks shon‘.

12:07.978 --> 12:11.562
He d/dn ’t need much.
He was a big kid at heart.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.730
Poor Pete.

12:13.817 --> 12:15.728
What he really loved
was hockey.

12:15.819 --> 12:19.311
/ wou/dn ’t be surprised
ifthat’s why he joined
the volunteer ﬁre department.

12:19.406 --> 12:23.240
I even got him this necklace.

12:23.327 --> 12:26.819
- Some crossed hockey sticks.
- [Camera Shutter Clicks]

12:26.914 --> 12:30.372
- You attended his games?
- Oh, all of’em. Yeah.

12:30.459 --> 12:33.121
You were a couple?

12:33.211 --> 12:37.796
It looks like someone went
through all of his belongings
and then leﬁ‘ them on the ﬂoor.

12:37.883 --> 12:39.623
Oh, it always
looked like that.

12:39.718 --> 12:42.004
The car outside
with the flat tires—
is that his?

12:42.095 --> 12:45.303
Yeah. Somebody slashed the tires
just before he disappeared.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.346
Why didn’t you
report him missing?

12:47.434 --> 12:49.470
I thought, maybe, mmm—

12:49.561 --> 12:52.018
I thought he was staying
with someone else.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.347
There’s a lot of bills here:
“Final Notice,” “Past Due.”

12:55.442 --> 12:58.024
Looks like he couldn’t afford
to feed his fish either.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.478
“Albie— Thursday, 1 1:00 pm.”

13:02.574 --> 13:05.611
- Do you know who Albie is?
- I don’t know.

13:05.702 --> 13:09.115
- This is blood.
- It’s a hockeyjersey, Bones.

13:09.206 --> 13:11.492
Hockey players bleed sometimes
when they play the game.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.960
Miss Withers, how bad
were his financial problems?

13:14.044 --> 13:16.751
Well, a couple days
before Pete disappeared

13:16.838 --> 13:19.500
he asked me for $2,000.

13:19.591 --> 13:21.752
Did he say what for?

13:21.843 --> 13:24.585
He liked me, you know?

13:24.680 --> 13:28.218
He was one ofthese guys—
He— He didn’t say much,

13:28.308 --> 13:30.094
but he could be real sweet

13:30.185 --> 13:32.096
And a man borrows money
from a woman—

13:32.187 --> 13:35.270
it means there’s a bond
oftrust, right?

13:35.399 --> 13:37.811
I don’t understand
your reasoning.
I do.

13:37.901 --> 13:40.563
It’s definitely
a... bond of trust.
You’re absolutely right.

13:40.654 --> 13:43.896
We’re terribly sorry
for your loss.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.031
Is that our victim?
Yes.

13:54.126 --> 13:56.162
The last ofthe tissue samples.

13:56.253 --> 13:58.869
Wendell can clean the skeleton now,
and you can do your thing.

13:58.964 --> 14:03.253
Oh, you still think the cause
ofdeath was a projectile
through the left eye?

14:03.343 --> 14:06.585
Yes, but since we found no bullet,
nor any indication...

14:06.680 --> 14:10.013
of gunpowder residue
in the wound, we’re stumped
as to what kind of projectile.

14:10.100 --> 14:15.470
The alveolus
around the incisor is cracked,
the socket caked with blood.

14:15.564 --> 14:18.772
- This is a recent loss.
- Well, he was a hockey player.

14:18.859 --> 14:22.647
- So basically we’re talking about gladiators.
- And I love it.

14:22.738 --> 14:25.229
Perhaps the sight
of males battling...

14:25.323 --> 14:27.939
stimulates the part
ofyour brain...

14:28.035 --> 14:30.401
which has so farfailed
to find a suitable mate.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.281
And thank God you’re here.

14:32.372 --> 14:36.331
The water I found in the victim’s
esophagus— not from the lake.

14:36.418 --> 14:38.579
Lake water
is microorganism infested.

14:38.670 --> 14:41.002
Water in his throat—
deionized brine water.

14:41.089 --> 14:44.377
He was killed,
then dumped in the ocean,
then dumped in the lake?

14:44.468 --> 14:47.505
Deionized brine water freezes clear.
Contains an anti—freezing agent—

14:47.596 --> 14:50.008
- which I know sounds counterintuitive—
- Ice rinks!

14:50.098 --> 14:51.554
[ C huck/es ]

14:51.641 --> 14:54.553
Kind ofjumped my punch line
there, Dr. B. But yes.

14:54.686 --> 14:59.180
We should see what rinks
are closest to the lake.
It’s the one Booth played at.

14:59.274 --> 15:03.267
| find it interesting that the evidence
keeps pointing toward Booth.

15:20.670 --> 15:24.834
- Pete Car/son was murdered?
- Pete— he’s indestructible.

15:24.925 --> 15:28.463
Not so indestructible.
This guy took him down
a few notches.

15:28.595 --> 15:32.338
Made him stay down too.
It was the heat ofthe game.
Your guy crossed the line.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.548
Yeah, he was our enforcer.
Took thejob real serious.

15:34.643 --> 15:38.352
Well, whoever got Pete
must’ve got a drop on him.
Pete wouldn’t go easy.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.850
You mind my asking why nobody
reported him missing?

15:40.941 --> 15:43.603
The night after you flattened Pete,
we go up against the state police.

15:43.693 --> 15:46.150
Pete gets into a beef with
a big state police left-winger.

15:46.238 --> 15:50.777
’C ause you handed him his ass
on a plattei; Pete maybe had
somethin ’ to prove that night.

15:50.867 --> 15:53.153
- You got a name?
- Hey, Alex!

15:53.245 --> 15:56.237
Yo!
Come here.

15:56.331 --> 15:59.949
The Fuzz player that Pete got
into it with his last game—
you remember his name?

16:00.043 --> 16:04.082
- Yeah. Lou Herrin, Number Five.
- So Pete took Herrin down
with a real cheap shot.

16:04.172 --> 16:05.207
He got tossed out
the rest of the season.

16:05.298 --> 16:09.132
Any chance that Pete
and this guy Herrin continued
their fight off the ice?

16:09.261 --> 16:11.547
People threaten.
Yeah, but nobody
carries through.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.253
Yeah. Keep it
on the ice, right?

16:13.348 --> 16:16.761
|f| were you,
I would talk to Chloe.

16:16.852 --> 16:20.640
- Who’s Chloe?
- [Player] Chloe Bratton.
- [Player #2] Chloe ’s a puck bunny

16:20.730 --> 16:22.721
Her and Pete put in some
quality mattress time
before he dumped her.

16:22.816 --> 16:26.559
Well, a mattress really isn’t,
uh, Chloe’s style, but, uh—
No offense.

16:26.653 --> 16:29.395
None taken.

/ can ’t believe Pete ’s gone.

16:37.789 --> 16:41.702
How long ago
did you two break up?
Break up?

16:41.793 --> 16:44.409
- We didn’t break up.
- His teammates think you did.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.120
No. We had this on-again,
off-again thing.

16:47.257 --> 16:51.250
/t was casual No biggie.
So—So you didn’t mind that
he slept with different women?

16:51.344 --> 16:55.713
I wouldn’t have minded if he did,
but I happen to know he didn’t.

16:55.807 --> 16:58.423
Oh, I happen to know
that he did.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.179
- [Quiet '
_ who? ly] Right.

17:00.270 --> 17:04.730
Oh, it doesn’t matter, does it,
given that your relationship
was so, um, casual?

17:04.816 --> 17:06.977
- You slashed his tires, didn’t you?
- Agent Booth.

17:07.068 --> 17:10.105
- No.
- We can prove you did it,
Chloe. So here’s the deal.

17:10.197 --> 17:12.779
You tell us the truth from now on,
and we won’t charge you...

17:12.866 --> 17:15.482
with vandalism
and obstruction ofjustice, okay?

17:15.619 --> 17:17.655
Let’s try this again.
You slashed—
Agent Booth.

17:17.746 --> 17:19.953
[ Quietly]
Yes.
Of course.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.952
Let’s try this again.
You slashed his tires,
didn’t you?

17:24.169 --> 17:26.251
Yes.

17:26.338 --> 17:29.330
I mean, he was sleeping
with someone else.

17:29.424 --> 17:32.131
I got passions
that take over sometimes.

17:32.219 --> 17:36.588
You know how it is when the guy
you give yourselftojust goes
offwith someone else.

17:38.141 --> 17:41.099
- Who’s, um, Albie?
- Albie?

17:42.771 --> 17:46.514
Albie runs this poker game in back
of a Chinese food joint off | Street.

17:46.608 --> 17:51.398
Probably why Pete was broke
all the time. So who’d you say
Pete was sleeping with?

17:51.488 --> 17:54.230
I think we’ve got
enough information
for today, Miss Bratton.

17:54.324 --> 17:57.782
- Thank you very much
for your cooperation.
- [Booth] Thanks.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.992
[Saroyan ] Any luck
with the murder weapon?
Yes.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.825
We are certain
it is not a screwdriver.

18:05.919 --> 18:08.661
Well, the blood on the victim’sjersey
was all his own.

18:08.797 --> 18:12.836
The rib cage
has been bruised.
It has?

18:12.926 --> 18:16.965
Yes. See this vague pattern
of bone bruising?

18:17.055 --> 18:19.011
[ Wendell]
Yeah, it extends
from the right clavicle...

18:19.099 --> 18:21.556
through anterior ribs
four through eight.

18:21.643 --> 18:24.555
He was...
struck repeatedly.

18:24.646 --> 18:27.479
What, by a hockey stick?
During the game maybe?

18:27.565 --> 18:31.774
Not during. The, um, padding
would pre vent that kind of bruising.

18:31.861 --> 18:35.228
I’ll take a closer look.
Uh, I can’t believe
I missed that.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.697
[Mouths Word]

18:44.541 --> 18:47.408
No, I can’t believe
you missed that either.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.720
I was signaling you
to encourage Wendell...

18:57.804 --> 19:00.090
by saying, “Anyone could’ve
missed that,” but—

19:00.181 --> 19:02.092
You should’ve said so.

19:02.183 --> 19:04.219
Booth says I stink
at nonverbal communication.

19:07.272 --> 19:09.012
[Whispering]
She said in the back.

19:09.107 --> 19:12.816
Okay.just don’t be pullin’
your gun until you go
through the kitchen,

19:12.902 --> 19:14.893
or mama-san there
is gonna hit
the panic button.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.979
Got it? Okay, just go.

a gunfight with your weapon
in the wrong hand.

19:25.415 --> 19:27.030
I don’t have a wrong hand.
I’m curious.

19:27.125 --> 19:30.117
When you shoot with your
left hand, does it feel like
somebody else is shooting?

19:30.211 --> 19:31.200
Easy!

Ah.

Okay. F.B.|.

- Drop your weapons, please.
- Please. The FBI.

19:47.354 --> 19:51.563
Okay, look. I really don’t care
about the illegal gambling.

19:51.649 --> 19:55.392
lyust wanna talk
to a guy named Albie...

19:55.487 --> 19:57.603
about a guy named Pete Carlson.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.983
[Guns Uncock]

20:03.995 --> 20:05.451
I’m Albie.

20:09.167 --> 20:12.330
First rule,
don’t kill the people
who owe you money.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.581
All you get then
is trouble and no money.

20:14.672 --> 20:18.256
How much money
did Carlson owe you?

20:18.343 --> 20:21.085
Okay. So, you got
your operation
shut down and moved out?

20:21.179 --> 20:24.216
Because I could have
my guys here in about,
what, three minutes...

20:24.307 --> 20:26.923
to mop that back room up.

20:27.018 --> 20:29.225
Pete Carlson was not a bad player
most ofthe time,

20:29.312 --> 20:31.223
but, you know,
every once in a while—

20:31.314 --> 20:32.895
He got brave and lost everything.

20:32.982 --> 20:35.598
- Gamble a bit yourself, do you?
- I’m reformed.

20:35.693 --> 20:38.355
Tell me, when was the last time
Carlson got, um, “brave”?

20:38.446 --> 20:41.904
Last month. But he paid up in full
a couple ofdays later.

20:41.991 --> 20:44.073
Cash?

20:49.040 --> 20:51.201
A little garish,
don’t you think?

20:51.292 --> 20:55.205
- I don’t know where Pete got it,
but it covered his debt.
- I’m gonna have to take this.

20:55.296 --> 20:59.005
|f| didn’t intend to give it
to you, you’d never have seen it.

20:59.092 --> 21:03.131
Okay, you gave me the time
I needed to move my operation.
I gave you evidence.

21:03.221 --> 21:04.882
/ call us square.

21:04.973 --> 21:09.182
You decide to get back
into the game, you look me up.

21:09.269 --> 21:10.850
Right. Yeah.

21:12.522 --> 21:14.888
Well, we gonna call this in?

21:14.983 --> 21:18.692
Oh, no point.
Like the woman said,
she’s moved on.

21:21.739 --> 21:25.948
Hodgins confirmed
that the traces of rink water
in the victim’s esophagus—

21:26.077 --> 21:28.614
[Murmurs]
came from this rink.

21:28.746 --> 21:31.283
Well, how did rink ice
get into his throat?
He was beaten,

21:31.374 --> 21:33.581
then a sharp instrument
was thrust into his eye.

21:33.668 --> 21:36.831
There should be...
blood stains.

21:38.047 --> 21:40.663
You’re going to scan the ice
with one little wand?

21:40.758 --> 21:43.625
I’ll call an FBI. forensics team.
We’ll have the whole place searched.

21:43.720 --> 21:46.712
No need. All you need
is black light, right?

21:46.848 --> 21:49.760
Yes.
Right? I got
a great idea.just—

21:49.893 --> 21:52.760
Whoa.
Stay here. It’s very
slippery. Don’t move.

21:54.856 --> 21:58.314
[Booth]
Ready? How’s that, huh?
[Brennan] Nice.

21:58.443 --> 22:00.980
[ Perotta ]
Wow.
Gonna work?

22:01.070 --> 22:03.686
Well, I see some, uh,
flecks of blood.

22:03.781 --> 22:08.024
No, we ’re looking for something bigger
than these small specks and spots.

22:08.119 --> 22:11.077
Ifthe victim was stabbed
in the eye, we’re looking
for a pretty significant puddle.

22:11.164 --> 22:14.122
Two guys get into
a beef then they put
their street clothes on...

22:14.209 --> 22:17.201
and then come back here
on the ice and duke it out?

22:17.295 --> 22:19.286
Booth.
Yeah.

22:20.715 --> 22:23.457
[Booth] Whoa.
[Perotta ]
Oh, my God

22:23.551 --> 22:26.964
This is going to turn out
to be where Pete Carlson
was murdered.

22:35.855 --> 22:38.688
[Device Beeps]
This is all the ice
from the crime scene,

22:38.775 --> 22:40.857
including the scrapings
from the Zamboni.

22:40.944 --> 22:44.857
We should be able to get enough
D.N.A. out ofthis to confirm
the blood is Carlson’s.

22:44.948 --> 22:47.985
Whoa.
Human tooth.

22:48.076 --> 22:51.159
It’s hockey.
That Zamboni probably had
a hundred teeth in there.

22:54.207 --> 22:57.415
Looks like we found where
the tooth fairy winters.

23:01.339 --> 23:04.376
[Sighs]
Did you find a match yet?
/uststarted.

23:04.467 --> 23:06.583
Shows it’s definitely
the victim’s blood.

23:06.678 --> 23:08.418
I still haven’t found
the murder weapon.

23:08.513 --> 23:12.973
I still haven’t identified
the nylon polymer I found
on the victim’s shirt.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.266
So I’ve looked at, //ke,
a thousand photos...

23:15.353 --> 23:18.720
ofthose blood patterns
at the rink and tons
from the apartment.

23:18.815 --> 23:21.898
- Why? What are you lookin’ for?
- Here’s a blood pattern
at the rink.

23:21.985 --> 23:23.976
The body was dragged
in that direction.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.857
Yeah, the body was dragged
that way, but what are
those drops over there?

23:26.948 --> 23:29.610
What drops?
Those drops
right there.

23:29.701 --> 23:33.489
The y parallel the dragging body.
And they aren ’t smeared

23:33.580 --> 23:36.447
These parallel drops
aren’t from the victim.

23:36.541 --> 23:38.953

- Not eating for three weeks?

ofthe deputy director...

that you are a viable suspect
in a murder case.

24:17.790 --> 24:22.079
Right. Okay, and he
wants you to make sure
that I’m not viable.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.623
That’s correct.
Come on, Sweets. You know
I didn’t kill anyone.

my teammate.

when the pupils dilate very wide,

intense interest or sexual attraction.

Wow.

35:50.024 --> 35:52.436
Oh, wow.

35:52.568 --> 35:56.186
Buried treasure.
What do we do now?

35:57.781 --> 36:01.273
Find out why the hell
he was hidingjewelry
in a fish tank.

36:04.705 --> 36:07.492
Have any ofyou
ever heard of something
called “chain of evidence”?

36:07.583 --> 36:09.039
Missjulian—

36:09.126 --> 36:11.538
Why didn’t you go
with these two idiots
to the victim’s home?

36:11.628 --> 36:14.165
- Please don’t call my people idiots.
- We’re not idiots.

36:14.256 --> 36:17.419
- I feel like an idiot.
- You don’t speak right now— either ofyou.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.591
[Saroyan ]
It’s a crime scene.

36:19.678 --> 36:22.260
My people are very often
at crime scenes.
It’s what we do.

36:22.348 --> 36:27.342
No, it’s not.
You’ve got it in your heads
that you’re crime-scene types.

36:27.436 --> 36:31.020
This is Booth’s fault
for indulging your fantasies.
You are not crime—scene types.

36:31.106 --> 36:34.724
- You are lab rats.
- No chain of evidence was broken.

36:34.818 --> 36:38.106
When Dr. Hodgins
and Mr. Bray found the items,
they immediately called me.

36:38.197 --> 36:42.361
I called Booth, and when
his head hurt too much to talk
to me, I called Agent Perotta.

36:42.451 --> 36:43.941
- Missjulian.
- What?

36:44.036 --> 36:46.243
A photograph ofdead fish
led them to this.

36:46.330 --> 36:48.446
I think that kind of brilliance
is worth it.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.787
You’ve been taken hostage
by the squints, Agent Perotta.

36:55.464 --> 36:58.956
Turns out these items
were reported destroyed
inaﬁm.

36:59.051 --> 37:00.962
The victim was a fireman.

37:01.053 --> 37:03.715
The FBI. could check
to see ifthe Firedawgs
put out that fire.

37:03.806 --> 37:06.764
Stole from the fire,
cleaned offwith ammonia.

37:06.850 --> 37:08.761
Hidden in the aquarium,
killed the fish.

37:08.852 --> 37:11.685
Okay. Now you are straying
out of your territ0/y.

37:11.772 --> 37:14.138
No. They got it right.

37:14.233 --> 37:18.693
The bracelet Agents Booth and Perotta
recovered from the victim’s loan shark...

37:18.779 --> 37:22.112
was reported destroyed
by that same fire.

37:22.199 --> 37:25.862
- Hmm. My people were right.
- [Together] Your people?

37:25.953 --> 37:29.286
- [Together]
We’re Booth’s people.
-Hmm.

37:33.794 --> 37:35.785
[Groans]

37:38.340 --> 37:42.003
[Sighing]

38:05.159 --> 38:07.070
They’re on the I-‘ireda wgs,

38:07.161 --> 38:10.653
but they also played on
the same h/gh school team.

38:10.789 --> 38:13.906
[Quietly]
What brings them together, eh?
[DoorOpens]

38:14.001 --> 38:16.162
I’m back.

38:16.295 --> 38:18.911
[Door Closes]
[Continues Quietly]
Hey, what brings them together?

38:19.006 --> 38:20.917
What brings
the team together?

38:21.008 --> 38:24.671
Sol got the soup
from the place.
And yes, I told “Mama”...

38:24.761 --> 38:28.379
that it was
for you especially.
[Clears Throat]

38:28.474 --> 38:32.308
[Quietly] lt’s all about
the team there. It’s all—

38:33.520 --> 38:35.476
What are you doing?
It’s all about the team there.

38:35.564 --> 38:38.476
Bones, it’s all about
the team there. They—

38:38.567 --> 38:41.559
These four guys— they all
played hockey together
in high school,

38:41.653 --> 38:45.737
and now they all play together
as a team.

38:45.866 --> 38:50.155
They’re all firemen?
Yeah, they all worked
thejewelry store fire.

38:50.245 --> 38:52.952
One ofthese three guys
is the murderer.

38:53.040 --> 38:55.326
According to Mr. Lucky?
[Pen Clatters]

38:55.417 --> 38:57.328
Ow. It’s Luc, okay? It is—

38:57.419 --> 39:01.037
/-It’s not “Mr. tucky. ”
It is t uc Robitaille.

39:01.131 --> 39:03.713
t eﬂ‘ wing. Great shot

39:03.800 --> 39:06.177
Luc Robitaille. He’s one of the best
left-wingers ofall time.

39:06.261 --> 39:09.549
- What is this?
- It’s a lace puller. Why?

39:09.640 --> 39:12.598
I think it might be
the murder weapon.

39:14.269 --> 39:16.521
We want to discuss
thejewelry store fire.

39:16.605 --> 39:18.516
I want a lawyer.
What for, Alex?

39:18.607 --> 39:21.599
- We didn’t do anything wrong.
None of us did.
- What about Pete?

39:21.693 --> 39:23.900
He break some kind
of fireman code,
somethin’ like that?

39:23.987 --> 39:25.693
Yeah, somethin’
like that.

39:25.781 --> 39:28.193
I’ve got nothin’ to say about
any ofthis. I want a lawyer.

39:28.283 --> 39:30.399
We know Carlson was beaten
with a hockey stick,

39:30.494 --> 39:34.783
after which, a lace puller entered his brain
through his eye and killed him.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.250
What about your dream, Ed?

39:37.334 --> 39:39.666
You were gonna play
for the NHL, right?

39:39.753 --> 39:44.213
“t oca/ Player S couted
by the NHL ” t ook at that one.

39:44.299 --> 39:47.791
Oh, this one’s good too:
‘7—‘ra/ic’s Hat Trick Wins Game.”

39:49.513 --> 39:51.424
I got injured.

39:51.515 --> 39:55.599
This injury would end
any chance ofa career
in professional hockey.

39:55.686 --> 39:58.302
- What does that have to do
with anything?
- Look, I got hurt.

39:58.438 --> 40:01.930
Now I sell siding and play
hockey on the weekends.
Why rub his face in the past?

40:02.025 --> 40:05.142
Who ruined you?

40:05.237 --> 40:07.148
Pete Carlson.

40:09.950 --> 40:13.534
- It was Pete.
- You all knew about the stolen jewelry?

40:13.620 --> 40:15.827
Question is,
how many ofyou were there
the night he was killed?

40:15.914 --> 40:19.281
None of us. Nobody here
had anything to do with that.

40:19.376 --> 40:23.836
We have the hockey stick,
the murder weapon and DNA.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.789
It’s only a matter oftime.

40:34.308 --> 40:36.640
Yeah.

40:36.727 --> 40:39.560
- What?
- It was me.

40:39.646 --> 40:42.433
Iasked
to meet Pete on the ice
after everybody left.

40:42.524 --> 40:45.140
I told him to give back
the stolen jewelry.

40:45.235 --> 40:48.352
And he said to me— He—

40:49.406 --> 40:53.365
He said to me that I was a—
a coward,

40:54.911 --> 40:56.867
that I didn’t do
anything to him...

40:56.955 --> 40:59.412
back in the day
when he wrecked my life...

40:59.499 --> 41:01.410
and I wouldn’t do
anything to him now.

41:05.464 --> 41:07.546
Well, he was wrong.

41:29.655 --> 41:32.522
- I’m not positive
this is a good idea.
- [Booth Chuckles]

41:32.658 --> 41:34.694
[Yelps]
Oh, I gotcha! I gotcha.
Stay up here.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.987
[Laughing]
Okay. It’s all right.
Here we go. One more.

41:37.079 --> 41:39.035
You know what?
I gotta stay up
all night.

41:39.122 --> 41:42.285
So who better to keep me
company than you?
[Laughing]

41:42.417 --> 41:46.330
You and me skating is saving you
from slipping into a coma?
Oh—

41:46.463 --> 41:49.250
Ah-Ah!
Easy, Bones. Now
I’m gonna go down.

41:49.341 --> 41:51.582
I have a lot of natural
athletic ability.

41:51.718 --> 41:54.334
Oh, yeah. Natural. I can—
I can see that.
[Chuckles]

41:54.429 --> 41:56.636
Real smooth and natural.
That’s it.

41:56.723 --> 41:59.430
Relax. Oh.
[Yelps]

42:01.353 --> 42:06.017
That Agent Perotta—
she really enjoyed
working with us.

42:06.149 --> 42:08.640
Yeah.
But, um,

42:10.737 --> 42:13.570
you’re the only FBI. agent
I want to work with.

42:15.409 --> 42:20.199
- Will you tell me what the—
Lucky Luciano told you?
- He’s not an opera singer.

42:20.288 --> 42:23.075
Why do you always say that wrong?
You do it on purpose, don’t you?

42:23.166 --> 42:25.623
I would like to know
what he said.

42:27.045 --> 42:30.412
He said that I’m not like...
my old man.

42:31.466 --> 42:33.377
He said I’m made
of better stuff.

42:33.468 --> 42:39.054
Well, I don’t know
your “old man”—
your father—

42:39.141 --> 42:41.848
but...

42:41.935 --> 42:45.519
I think you’re made of
very, very good stuff.

42:46.857 --> 42:50.065
Hey, know what? Forget about
Agent Perotta, all right?

42:50.152 --> 42:52.313
Nothing’s gonna change
between me and you.

42:52.404 --> 42:57.194
Well, entropy is a natural force
that pulls everything apart
at a subatomic level.

42:57.325 --> 42:59.577
Everything changes.
Don’t!
Not everything, Bones.

42:59.703 --> 43:01.659
[Yelps]
[Laughing]
Not everything.

43:01.788 --> 43:04.621
You’re gonna
make me fall.
I’m never gonna make you fall.

43:04.750 --> 43:07.742
I’m always here. You kiddin’ me?
This is kinda fun
actuaHy.

43:07.878 --> 43:10.665
Yes, see, I can—
Watch, here comes the big spin.
Uh-oh.

43:11.923 --> 43:15.336
[Brennan Laughs]
Whoa!
[Chattering] Go easy.

43:49.252 --> 43:50.662
What’s that mean?
