"Cops" is filmed on location

00:31.367 --> 00:33.367
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.767
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:35.800 --> 00:37.800
in a court of law.

00:39.433 --> 00:42.600
-I have, uh,
my twin brother, who works
on the same squad as I,

00:42.633 --> 00:45.000
and, uh, I guess ever since
we were kids, we knew

00:45.033 --> 00:46.700
that we wanted to be
police officers.

00:46.733 --> 00:48.433
Both our folks were
on the department,

00:48.467 --> 00:50.600
did their time.
Growin' up, we saw them

00:50.633 --> 00:52.933
wear the badge,
this same uniform, and knew

00:52.967 --> 00:54.800
that's what we wanted to do
when we got older.

00:54.833 --> 00:56.700
And now it's cool that
we're able to work

00:56.733 --> 01:00.400
side by side, each
and every night together.

01:00.433 --> 01:04.067
Just saw a Hispanic male
jaywalk across the street here,

01:04.067 --> 01:07.200
and it looks like he's runnin'
over to the bus stop.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.400
Yeah, he looks like he's tryin'
to hide from us, so let's see

01:09.433 --> 01:11.067
if we can catch up to him,
see what his deal is.

01:11.067 --> 01:12.300
-(radio chatter)

01:12.333 --> 01:15.133
All right, we're just gonna
have to walk up on him.

01:15.167 --> 01:19.767
One time HMA, I'll be
in front of, uh,
Boulder Station.

01:19.800 --> 01:22.500
-(radio chatter)

01:22.533 --> 01:24.900
It's all right, man,
come here.

01:24.933 --> 01:27.267
You, come here.
Let me talk to you real quick.

01:28.433 --> 01:29.567
Come here!

01:29.600 --> 01:30.667
Three John, uh, foot pursuit.

01:30.700 --> 01:33.933
HMA, uh, wearing, uh,
basketball jersey, gray,

01:33.967 --> 01:37.267
black shorts, black backpack.
Metro Police, stop!

01:37.300 --> 01:39.700
Get on the ground!
You're gonna get tased!

01:39.733 --> 01:42.433
Droppin' backpack.
Put your hands out!

01:42.467 --> 01:44.867
I got him at Las Palomas break.
I have him proned out.

01:44.900 --> 01:47.633
Dropped a backpack
in the middle of the complex.

01:47.667 --> 01:49.233
-I've got a ticket already
for jaywalking.

01:49.267 --> 01:51.567
-Hey, sir, look--
-You're not listenin' to me!

01:51.600 --> 01:54.067
-I've got a ticket already
for jaywalking.
-I don't care.

01:54.100 --> 01:57.433
(car screeching)

01:59.233 --> 02:00.900
-Hey, sir, I want
to tell you something,

02:00.933 --> 02:02.767
I had
on my bag, right?

02:02.800 --> 02:05.100
Hey, sir, look--
you don't (bleep)--

02:05.133 --> 02:07.300
-Get up!
Shut up!

02:07.333 --> 02:10.467
-All right, sir.
All right, sir, I don't
wanna get...t

02:10.500 --> 02:12.233
I don't wanna
get tased, all right?

02:12.267 --> 02:15.200
I just don't want
another ticket.

02:15.233 --> 02:17.433
-Hey, thanks, brother.
-Megan!

02:17.467 --> 02:19.300
-Hold him real quick,
let me go get his backpack.

02:19.333 --> 02:22.833
-(breathing heavily)

02:22.867 --> 02:26.767
-(radio chatter)

02:26.800 --> 02:28.567
-Hey, man, what's uh,
what's your name?

02:28.600 --> 02:31.067
-Dominick, sir.
-Dominick? Why you
runnin', Dominick?

02:31.067 --> 02:33.633
-'Cause I got a ticket,
and I got somethin'
in my backpack that you have.

02:33.667 --> 02:36.300
-Okay, what do you have
in your backpack
that you shouldn't have?

02:36.333 --> 02:38.600
-Some dope, sir.
-Some dope? What kind of dope?

02:38.633 --> 02:40.933
-Skunky.
-What?

02:40.967 --> 02:43.067
You have some what?
-Crystal, sir.

02:43.067 --> 02:45.200
-Some crystal? Okay.

02:47.067 --> 02:48.633
-And what was the reason
you stopped me?

02:48.667 --> 02:51.200
-What's the reason
I stopped you?
-Because I was, uh, jaywalking?

02:51.233 --> 02:52.967
-'Cause you jaywalked
right across, man.

02:53.067 --> 02:55.833
And then I saw you,
I looked at you... you were
waitin' for me to go through,

02:55.867 --> 02:58.267
'cause you were lookin' like
you were gonna walk
into Boulder Station,

02:58.300 --> 02:59.633
then you just ran
right back out.

02:59.667 --> 03:00.967
-Well, I was waiting
for the bus stop.

03:01.067 --> 03:02.133
-Yeah.
-In the shade.

03:02.167 --> 03:03.267
-How much crystal's
in there, man?

03:03.300 --> 03:06.200
-I don't know.
-You're not sure?

03:06.233 --> 03:08.867
Show my partner where exactly
it is inside the backpack.

03:08.900 --> 03:10.700
-Front pocket.
-The front pocket?

03:12.633 --> 03:14.633
-You a dealer?
-No.

03:14.667 --> 03:17.133
-What does that
look like to you?

03:17.167 --> 03:18.800
-(radio chatter)

03:18.833 --> 03:20.367
-Packaged for sales,
doesn't it?

03:20.400 --> 03:22.400
-Yes, sir.
-Individually packaged,
explain it to me,

03:22.433 --> 03:23.867
what do you think
we're lookin' at?

03:23.900 --> 03:27.700
-Right, this is (indistinct)
somethin' like that?
-Indivi--

03:27.733 --> 03:30.200
-Intent to sell?
-Intent to sell?

03:30.233 --> 03:31.767
-What's up with the spray
paint, man?

03:31.800 --> 03:33.067
You a tagger, too?

03:33.067 --> 03:35.600
-It's for work.
I was gonna start construction.

03:35.633 --> 03:37.633
-Construction?
That's one can of spray.

03:37.667 --> 03:39.667
-How long you been
gangbanging?

03:39.700 --> 03:41.467
-I don't wanna talk no more,
I look stupid right now.

03:41.500 --> 03:44.067
-Why do you look stupid?
I mean, if I were you,
I would start

03:44.100 --> 03:45.733
hittin' the treadmill
and get a little faster.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.100
-I'm sick.
-You're sick?

03:47.133 --> 03:49.100
That's why you're so slow?
(laughs)

03:49.133 --> 03:52.067
Come on, man! Really?

03:52.067 --> 03:53.467
Who's the girlfriend?

03:53.500 --> 03:55.767
Hi. Here... it's okay.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.067
Listen, uh, we went
to stop him

03:57.067 --> 03:58.467
'cause he illegally
crossed the street,.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.600
okay?
I wasn't even lookin'
to give him a citation.

04:00.633 --> 04:03.067
But when you run
from the police, and obviously
we have a different story,

04:03.067 --> 04:04.800
and somethin' else
is goin' on, okay?

04:04.833 --> 04:08.767
So, uh, once we're done,
if you want to talk with him,
I will give you some time

04:08.800 --> 04:11.133
to do that, okay?
Just so you can figure it out,
I know you're pregnant,

04:11.167 --> 04:12.433
right?
-Yeah.

04:12.467 --> 04:14.167
-Okay. So if you just wanna
hang out and get some shade,

04:14.200 --> 04:15.700
and I'll call you over
when we're ready, okay?

04:15.733 --> 04:17.333
All right.
-Thank you.

04:18.900 --> 04:22.867
-Okay. These came back
positive here?
-Everything came back positive.

04:22.900 --> 04:26.200
Positive for marijuana,
positive for methamphetamine.

04:26.233 --> 04:29.300
-Okay. And the total weights
for the marijuana was...?

04:29.333 --> 04:33.333
-6.6 and 4.9 grams' worth.
-Okay.

04:34.500 --> 04:37.100
-Hey, Dominick... did you
wa-- did you wanna talk?

04:37.133 --> 04:38.867
Yeah, I know you got
a pregnant girl
over there, okay,

04:38.900 --> 04:40.833
and I know
she's really upset right now.

04:40.867 --> 04:42.400
What part of California
are you from?

04:42.433 --> 04:44.067
-East L.A.
-East L.A.?

04:44.067 --> 04:45.333
What brought you out here
to Vegas?

04:45.367 --> 04:48.333
I was workin'
as a little prep chef...
-A prep chef?

04:48.367 --> 04:50.133
-Like a prep cook?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:50.167 --> 04:52.600
-Yeah.
At a sushi spot, and then
I was workin' at KFC.

04:52.633 --> 04:55.800
-So how... you--
you were-- you were doin'--

04:55.833 --> 04:57.300
Are you still cookin'?

04:57.333 --> 04:59.533
-Wha-- What happened
with the job?
-Lost-- Lost my temper

04:59.567 --> 05:02.367
and I lost the job.
-You lost your temper?
What happened there?

05:02.400 --> 05:05.267
-Arguing (bleep).
-Arguing with the,
uh, with the--

05:05.300 --> 05:06.433
with the boss or what?

05:06.467 --> 05:07.500
-Fellow employees.

05:07.533 --> 05:08.667
-Fellow employee?

05:08.700 --> 05:11.200
Man, you gotta get your stuff
together, man.

05:11.233 --> 05:13.400
You're young, dude.
You got a kid on the way.

05:13.433 --> 05:15.433
-Yeah.
-You really wanna be
livin' this life?

05:15.467 --> 05:18.067
You're out here just playin'
these games, man.

05:18.067 --> 05:20.400
All right, Dominick,
I just wanna let you know
what you're being charged

05:20.433 --> 05:23.067
with today, okay? You're being
charged with intent to sell
the marijuana,

05:23.100 --> 05:27.833
also trafficking a controlled
substance. Also possession
of Schedule 1 narcotic,

05:27.867 --> 05:29.267
which is gonna be
the methamphetamine.

05:29.300 --> 05:30.633
Okay, and trafficking
as well on that.

05:30.667 --> 05:32.600
Do you have any questions?
-That's all I got?

05:32.633 --> 05:34.633
-Wh-- That's it?
-That's all the charges
I got?

05:34.667 --> 05:37.367
-I mean that's... a few
felonies right there.

05:37.400 --> 05:40.200
-Did you guys thought
I was, uh-- you guys thought
I was tryin' to like,

05:40.233 --> 05:43.067
hide baggies on me?
-Well, you weren't puttin'
your hands out to your side,

05:43.067 --> 05:45.900
that's why-- that's why
you were forced to put
your hands out.

05:45.933 --> 05:47.600
What we're most concerned
about here is the hands,

05:47.633 --> 05:48.767
'cause those hands
will kill, okay?

05:48.800 --> 05:50.367
And when you put it down
by your waist,

05:50.400 --> 05:52.433
and you're diggin'
in your pockets, of course
we're gonna take--

05:52.467 --> 05:54.067
-I was diggin' in my pockets?
-We're gonna dig--

05:54.067 --> 05:55.967
Yeah, don't you remember
takin' your--
your earphones out,

05:56.067 --> 05:57.067
and then shovin' somethin'

05:57.100 --> 05:58.733
in your pockets?
-Yeah, I took my phone out.

05:58.767 --> 06:01.133
-Yeah, you can't do that, man.
-Next time you get stopped
by the police,

06:01.167 --> 06:02.700
you immediately stop
and show your hands, okay?

06:02.733 --> 06:03.733
-All right, sir.
-All right.

06:05.067 --> 06:07.767
-I was waiting for the bus.
-I know, but dude...

06:08.867 --> 06:11.767
I understand, though.
I get it. Just...

06:13.133 --> 06:15.667
-Are they gonna be here
when I get out?
Probably not, huh?

06:15.700 --> 06:18.267
-Who?
-You guys gonna hold down
the apartment while I'm gone?

06:18.300 --> 06:20.233
-Yeah, we got to,
what are you talkin' about,
we got kids.

06:20.267 --> 06:22.567
-I know, but I have
that job coming, you know.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.167
-Well, now you just gotta
just sit in there and just,

06:25.200 --> 06:28.600
you know, think about,
to get your (bleep) together,

06:28.633 --> 06:30.200
you can come out and be right.

06:30.233 --> 06:32.533
-I told him he's got a kid
on the way, he's gotta
figure it out.

06:32.567 --> 06:34.567
-You are speakin' like
a grown-ass man, not like
a little kid.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.767
-Oh, you guys know
Megan's pregnant now?

06:36.800 --> 06:40.500
-I-- I knew, but she-- she
didn't tell me, I-- I'm
the sister, I know (bleep).

06:40.533 --> 06:41.967
-(laughs)
She needs you for backup.

06:42.067 --> 06:43.933
-Yeah.
But just do there,
go in there,

06:43.967 --> 06:47.533
do what you gotta do,
come out a better man,
that's all I can say.

06:47.567 --> 06:51.400
You know?
The (bleep) today.
For Megan and the baby.

06:51.433 --> 06:52.967
-Okay.
-We'll be all right.

06:55.267 --> 06:59.500
-I grew up in Canyon, Texas,
which is a few miles south
of Amarillo.

06:59.533 --> 07:03.300
I served on the Fire Department
there as an EMT firefighter.

07:03.333 --> 07:07.700
Worked alongside the Canyon P.D.
on several different occasions.

07:07.733 --> 07:10.933
And each time it kinda grew
my interest in what they did.

07:10.967 --> 07:13.833
A couple years later,
I applied up here

07:13.867 --> 07:15.967
at Amarillo Police Department,

07:16.067 --> 07:20.567
and I got on the first try.
And I've been enjoyin' it
ever since,

07:20.600 --> 07:23.900
and I look forward to, uh,
finishin' up my career here

07:23.933 --> 07:25.467
at the Amarillo
Police Department.

07:27.267 --> 07:29.533
Gonna pull this vehicle over
in front of us for, uh,

07:29.567 --> 07:33.200
not signalling within 100 feet
of their turn, they just
made a sudden stop,

07:33.233 --> 07:34.700
and took a right turn.

07:37.633 --> 07:39.933
-(radio chatter)

07:39.967 --> 07:41.733
-Yeah, something's up.

07:43.700 --> 07:46.733
-(radio chatter)

07:47.833 --> 07:49.900
-(radio chatter)

07:54.700 --> 07:56.233
-Show me your hands.

07:56.267 --> 07:59.300
All right. Reason I pulled
you over is you didn't signal...

07:59.333 --> 08:01.967
-Oh, I thought--
-Within 100 feet comin'
right here.

08:02.067 --> 08:04.567
-Are you serious?
-Yes, I am serious.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.133
Can I get your ID?

08:06.167 --> 08:09.300
-I don't have
a driver's license.
-I don't have my ID...

08:09.333 --> 08:12.900
-You don't have your ID?
-She takes the car while I--

08:12.933 --> 08:17.300
-Listen... y'all need
to settle down. You're nervous.

08:17.333 --> 08:19.933
That's cool. All right,
turn the car off for me.

08:19.967 --> 08:23.100
-We just had argument, sir.
-Turn the car off.

08:23.133 --> 08:24.800
-I'm sorry.
-Don't-- Don't reach down
by your seat.

08:24.833 --> 08:26.067
Turn your car off.

08:26.100 --> 08:27.767
Okay?

08:27.800 --> 08:30.467
Go ahead and-- I'm gonna get you
to step outta the car,
undo your seat belt.

08:30.500 --> 08:33.667
-I was sayin', with--
she had the car checked out--
-They were dropping me off.

08:33.700 --> 08:35.067
-That's fine.
-Her car--

08:35.067 --> 08:36.400
-Set your cigarette down.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.933
-Her car was messin' up--
-I got you.

08:38.967 --> 08:40.933
-Was messin' up,
and I was trying to...
-Come back over here.

08:40.967 --> 08:42.767
Step back over here. Okay?

08:42.800 --> 08:45.467
Step right here behind the car.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.400
Is there anything in the car
that I need to know about?

08:47.433 --> 08:48.867
Who's car is this?

08:48.900 --> 08:50.200
-This is mine.
-Is it your car?

08:50.233 --> 08:51.333
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

08:51.367 --> 08:54.367
-Do you mind if I--
search it? Good with that?

08:54.400 --> 08:57.600
-I don't mind, I'm good
with it.

08:57.633 --> 09:00.400
-All right. You need
to have a seat right here.

09:00.433 --> 09:01.900
Sit on the ground.

09:01.933 --> 09:03.067
Cross your legs.

09:05.067 --> 09:06.167
Come back over here.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.833
You have anything
on your person?

09:08.867 --> 09:10.933
-Huh?
-Do you have anything
on you that's gonna poke me

09:10.967 --> 09:12.067
or stick me or anything
like that?

09:12.100 --> 09:13.900
-No, sir.
-Have a seat right here.

09:13.933 --> 09:17.067
-Sit right here,
face the...
yeah, right there.

09:18.633 --> 09:19.867
Okay.

09:21.167 --> 09:25.700
I'm just lookin' for any
narcotics, anything like that.

09:25.733 --> 09:29.067
And, with them bein'
as nervous as they have been,

09:29.067 --> 09:31.500
it just heightens
my suspicions.

09:31.533 --> 09:33.233
Just as we found here.

09:34.333 --> 09:36.500
This is gonna be a meth pipe.

09:36.533 --> 09:40.833
Um, and we have a little
bit of a...

09:40.867 --> 09:43.167
crystal-like substance.

09:44.900 --> 09:46.433
Right in here it was found.

09:47.700 --> 09:50.333
Known to be methamphetamines.

09:53.433 --> 09:55.067
Two more pipes.

09:57.533 --> 10:00.400
And also another meth pipe
inside here.

10:03.667 --> 10:05.800
-Hey.
-All right, so...

10:05.833 --> 10:09.267
I got-- pulled these people over
on traffic, and uh,

10:09.300 --> 10:11.967
as of right now, I got
three different sets

10:12.000 --> 10:13.900
-of paraphernalia,
-Okay.

10:13.933 --> 10:17.033
and, uh, some, uh...
methamphetamines.

10:17.067 --> 10:18.467
-Okay.
-Right now.

10:18.500 --> 10:21.533
-So I just need y'all's help
to detain them, I'm gonna do--

10:21.567 --> 10:24.033
I'll do P3's and everything.
I just need-- I don't have
anywhere to put 'em.

10:24.067 --> 10:25.233
-I got you.
-Okay?

10:25.267 --> 10:26.533
-There's three of 'em.

10:29.767 --> 10:31.967
-You're okay.
-We're gonna go back
to my car,

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
it's the far one back
there, okay?
-Can I go?

10:35.933 --> 10:38.867
-Inside this vehicle,
I found a glass case, okay?

10:38.900 --> 10:43.133
Inside that I found
a meth pipe, and I found meth

10:43.167 --> 10:45.633
inside a plastic baggie.

10:45.667 --> 10:47.100
Do you know anything
about that?

10:47.133 --> 10:49.467
-Um... I'm not quite sure
exactly who had it.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.233
-Okay. Well, who do you--
-I just know that I didn't
have it,

10:52.267 --> 10:54.133
and I don't believe
that she had it.

10:54.167 --> 10:57.167
-Okay, so are you saying
that... it's Jerome's?

10:57.200 --> 11:00.467
-I'm not putting any name to it.
I'm not getting anyone
in trouble.

11:00.500 --> 11:01.567
I'm not in trouble.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.800
-Are you aware that
you have warrants?

11:03.833 --> 11:07.300
-I shouldn't have warrants.
-You have three capias.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.967
-You've gotta be kidding me.

11:09.067 --> 11:12.667
-No, ma'am. Well, tonight
you're being arrested
for your capias warrants.

11:12.700 --> 11:16.567
There's a glasses case
that was sittin' between
you and him.

11:16.600 --> 11:19.500
I opened it up... and
there's meth in it.

11:19.533 --> 11:21.600
-That's not mine.
-And then there's a meth pipe.

11:21.633 --> 11:23.067
-That's not mine.
-Okay.

11:23.100 --> 11:26.167
-I don't do...
-Who-- Who's is it?

11:26.200 --> 11:27.600
-It's his.
-It's his?

11:27.633 --> 11:28.767
-Yes.
-Okay?

11:28.800 --> 11:30.067
-Did you see him with it?
-Yes.

11:30.067 --> 11:32.067
What about this black bag
that's inside there,

11:32.067 --> 11:34.233
it's like a little makeup-
lookin' bag? Who's is that?

11:34.267 --> 11:36.333
-That's-- That's his.
-That's his too?

11:36.367 --> 11:37.767
-Yeah.
-What was in that car
that was yours?

11:37.800 --> 11:41.067
-My purse.
-Okay, tell me-- describe
your purse to me.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.733
-It's purple and gold.
-Okay.

11:43.767 --> 11:46.300
-Well, I'm gonna let you
know this. You know you have
the warrant, right?

11:46.333 --> 11:50.067
-Okay. Well, there was a meth
pipe inside that purse.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.300
It's a paraphernalia charge,
nothing big.

11:52.333 --> 11:54.267
But I've already been
arrested once.

11:54.300 --> 11:57.067
-All right, listen.
It's nothin', it's a class C.

11:57.100 --> 11:58.533
It's equivalent
to a traffic warrant.

11:58.567 --> 12:01.167
Okay?
All right.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.133
Come back down here
and have a seat.

12:04.567 --> 12:06.067
Okay.

12:06.100 --> 12:10.500
Both females are puttin'
what I found inside
that vehicle with him.

12:10.533 --> 12:14.433
And it was in his reach.
Therefore, with the way
he was actin'

12:14.467 --> 12:16.967
when I first pulled up...
all of 'em were actin',

12:17.067 --> 12:19.567
it fits--
it fits it perfectly.

12:19.600 --> 12:24.200
So, the females are the ones
goin' for warrants,
the other one's goin'

12:24.233 --> 12:25.467
for paraphernalia
and a warrant,

12:25.500 --> 12:26.933
and he's gonna go
for his warrant

12:26.967 --> 12:29.300
and possession
of a controlled substance.

12:30.933 --> 12:33.233
Just check it out, listen...
real quick.

12:33.267 --> 12:37.267
I found a meth pipe
with meth in a clear plastic
baggie, okay?

12:37.300 --> 12:40.400
They told me that it's yours.
Both of 'em, without
being next to each other

12:40.433 --> 12:43.167
or anything, they both
said it was yours.
-No, no, sir, no, no.

12:43.200 --> 12:46.600
It's not-- no, no, no.
No, no.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.233
Sir, that's not my (bleep).

12:48.267 --> 12:51.333
It ain't even... (bleep).

12:51.367 --> 12:53.300
Seriously, that's not mine, sir.
-Yeah?

12:53.333 --> 12:56.167
-Seriously.
-Today you're being charged
with possession

12:56.200 --> 12:58.300
of a controlled substance..
-Sir, please, no, man, please.

12:58.333 --> 13:00.867
-Okay?
-Please, sir, man...

13:00.900 --> 13:03.367
And then you're also gonna get
paraphernalia charge.
-Please, sir. But, sir,

13:03.400 --> 13:07.067
can I have a... sir, please,
man, please, please, please
please, please, please, please.

13:07.067 --> 13:10.067
Please, no sir, please.
I'm not lyin', man.
-I'm-- I can't do anything

13:10.067 --> 13:11.933
about it. Okay?
-Sir, please.

13:11.967 --> 13:14.467
-All right.
-Sir, please...

13:14.500 --> 13:16.567
-Have a better day.
-Seriously, sir,
that's not my stuff,

13:16.600 --> 13:18.167
I promise, man.

13:19.533 --> 13:23.133
-Vegas, it's a 24-hour town,
so it keeps us pretty busy.

13:23.167 --> 13:25.067
Sometimes you have to be
a friend, a counselor.

13:25.100 --> 13:27.333
Sometimes you have to be
that, uh, dad,

13:27.367 --> 13:29.067
that, uh, has stepped out,

13:29.067 --> 13:31.867
and a lot of times it's
just a lot of different hats,

13:31.900 --> 13:34.600
and you don't have that long
to think about which one

13:34.633 --> 13:36.500
to put on. You just kinda
step into the role,

13:36.533 --> 13:38.600
and, uh, do your best.

13:40.767 --> 13:44.200
We're en route to a domestic
disturbance where the father

13:44.233 --> 13:49.167
apparently is going nuts
in the house, and the juveniles
are trying to hold him back.

13:49.200 --> 13:53.133
Uh, we're gonna go check and see
what's actually goin' on.

13:53.167 --> 13:54.833
-(radio chatter)

13:59.367 --> 14:01.833
-Hello.
-He's fighting with the boys
all the time.

14:01.867 --> 14:02.867
-Okay.

14:04.300 --> 14:05.767
Hey, Pablo, can you come here?

14:05.800 --> 14:07.500
Pablo, come here.

14:07.533 --> 14:09.267
-Just come over here.

14:09.300 --> 14:12.800
-(dog barking)
-Everybody argue? Okay?

14:12.833 --> 14:14.967
-What?
-Everybody's arguin', okay?

14:15.067 --> 14:16.700
-Okay, well, let's go
outside quick.

14:16.733 --> 14:18.900
-No, listen-- No, listen.

14:18.933 --> 14:20.633
-Just leave them!

14:20.667 --> 14:22.633
-I don't do nothing!

14:26.933 --> 14:29.333
-Give me your other hand,
stop resisting!

14:29.367 --> 14:32.100
-I'm not resisting.
-Stop resisting, give me
your other hand!

14:34.600 --> 14:36.900
-Listen, everybody
need to go!

14:36.933 --> 14:39.567
Woman:
Relax...
-Okay? Listen to me.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.700
-Don't do that!
-Okay?

14:41.733 --> 14:44.767
-(dog barking excitedly)
-Can you get that?

14:47.600 --> 14:49.067
-Stop resisting.
-I'm not resisting.

14:49.067 --> 14:51.733
-When I tell you
to do something, do it.
-I'm not resisting.

14:51.767 --> 14:53.900
-You are resisting.
Come on, let's go outside.

14:59.633 --> 15:03.233
-Spread your feet.
What's your deal, man?

15:04.233 --> 15:05.767
-I don't want nothing
with you.

15:07.067 --> 15:09.067
-When I tell you
to do something, that means
do it.

15:09.067 --> 15:10.567
You gotta come outside
and talk to me.

15:12.633 --> 15:13.867
Don't move from there.

15:13.900 --> 15:17.333
Glue your feet to here.
Got it?

15:17.367 --> 15:19.267
Wait right there.
Finish your food, okay?

15:19.300 --> 15:23.067
-No, that's not right, man.
That's not right, okay?

15:23.100 --> 15:24.600
-How you doin', ma'am?
My name's Officer Rapp,

15:24.633 --> 15:26.133
Las Vegas Metropolitan Police.
-Mm-hmm.

15:26.167 --> 15:28.433
So, what happened today?

15:28.467 --> 15:31.233
It's because my sister
came over, and he doesn't
really like her and stuff,

15:31.267 --> 15:33.100
and... he just started talkin'--

15:33.133 --> 15:35.533
you know, we're over there
playing lotteria and we're
havin' fun and everything,

15:35.567 --> 15:37.967
and he didn't like that.
He just thinks that we're
just joking about him.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.433
It's not about him.
-Okay. Okay.

15:39.467 --> 15:40.767
How long have you guys
been married?

15:40.800 --> 15:44.267
Um... he's 13...
it's about 13 years.

15:44.300 --> 15:47.400
-Okay.
-But this is an ongoing thing.
Every time we get in a fight,

15:47.433 --> 15:49.900
the boys intervene and stuff,
and then he starts fighting
with the boys.

15:49.933 --> 15:53.067
-So he starts arguing
with you...
-He starts arguing with me--

15:53.067 --> 15:55.067
-the boys step in
to defend you...
-Exactly.

15:55.067 --> 15:56.967
-and then he puts hands
on his oldest,

15:57.067 --> 15:58.967
and everybody
else tries to hold him back.
-Exactly.

15:59.067 --> 16:00.233
-Okay.
-Mm-hm.

16:00.267 --> 16:01.567
-All right, what's your, uh,
oldest's name?

16:01.600 --> 16:02.833
-Pablo.
-Can I talk to him?

16:02.867 --> 16:04.300
-Yes.
-All right. Hey, Pablo?

16:04.333 --> 16:05.733
Can you come here
for a second?

16:07.333 --> 16:09.600
What's up, man?
Name's Officer Rapp
with Las Vegas

16:09.633 --> 16:11.633
Metropolitan Police.
Can I see your knuckles?

16:11.667 --> 16:13.967
Do you-- I'm gonna go ahead
and get you medical for that.

16:14.067 --> 16:16.067
Okay?
Uh, what happened?

16:16.067 --> 16:18.700
-He told me, like, he was like,
you gonna get this, that's what
you're gonna get,

16:18.733 --> 16:21.500
'cause I was telling him that,
like, he was being childish
and stuff,

16:21.533 --> 16:25.567
that he needs to stop acting
like that, and he goes ahead
and act like a child.

16:25.600 --> 16:28.467
-Did he hit your mom at all?
-No, he didn't hit my mom
at all.

16:28.500 --> 16:31.067
-Did he hit you at all?
-No, he just ripped my shirt,
that's about it...

16:31.067 --> 16:33.067
-How did he rip your shirt?
-He grabbed it and just
ripped it.

16:33.100 --> 16:36.133
-He grabbed it?
Can I-- Can I see if you have
any, uh-- Can you lift up

16:36.167 --> 16:39.267
your shirt?
Do you have any other...?
-No.

16:39.300 --> 16:40.767
-No?
-No.

16:40.800 --> 16:44.367
-All right, man. Um, and you
said your knuckles, that
was all from--

16:44.400 --> 16:46.967
-From the fence right there
because I didn't wanna hit him,

16:47.067 --> 16:49.433
because me and him got in
fistfights before...
-You broke that fence.

16:49.467 --> 16:52.600
-Yes.
-Okay. Just hang out over here
so you can take a deep breath,

16:52.633 --> 16:55.567
get away from your brothers.
Um, and then, like I said,
I'll get you medical.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.800
I gotta go talk to him,
then we'll find out
what we're gonna do.

16:57.833 --> 16:58.900
-All right.
-All right?

16:58.933 --> 17:00.800
-Okay.

17:00.833 --> 17:02.400
-Do you know what happened
to your son's hands?

17:02.433 --> 17:03.800
Why are they bleedin'?

17:03.833 --> 17:05.733
-No.
-You don't know anything
about that.

17:05.767 --> 17:10.700
-Nobody-- No-- They pushing--
Nobody hitting, nobody hitting
me, and I don't hit nobody.

17:10.733 --> 17:13.600
-Well, here's the thing, okay?
-I don't have (bleep)--

17:13.633 --> 17:15.333
-Listen to me, okay?

17:15.367 --> 17:17.600
You've been drinkin'
today. Obvious--
-Everybody's drinkin'.

17:17.633 --> 17:19.533
-I understand that.
You've been drinking today.

17:19.567 --> 17:21.667
-I accept that.
-We're trying to prevent people
from getting hurt

17:21.700 --> 17:25.300
and going to jail.
Obviously, your sons,
they're upset right now.

17:25.333 --> 17:27.967
Your oldest son over here--
Listen to me...
-I take care of my sons

17:28.067 --> 17:29.267
all the time, man.
-Listen to me.

17:29.300 --> 17:30.767
Your oldest son over here,
-I know...

17:30.800 --> 17:32.567
-I don't know if you saw
what he did to that fence,

17:32.600 --> 17:35.600
but he literally broke,
like three panels
on that fence

17:35.633 --> 17:41.200
because they're so upset
the way that you and your wife
were acting around each other.

17:41.233 --> 17:42.967
Where do you think
you're gonna go tonight?

17:43.067 --> 17:44.667
-Huh?
-Where do you think
you're gonna go tonight?

17:44.700 --> 17:46.533
-Who?
-You.

17:46.567 --> 17:50.367
-I don't wanna be in jail.
-I'm not taking you to jail,
but I need you to go

17:50.400 --> 17:52.800
somewhere else.
Here's the thing:
we need to do this thing

17:52.833 --> 17:54.567
called a cool-down period.

17:54.600 --> 17:58.100
The cool-down period
is because your sons are upset
about the situation right now.

17:58.133 --> 18:01.433
You seem to be the person
who's making them upset.

18:01.467 --> 18:04.433
So...
-Not me, man. Not me.
For reals.

18:04.467 --> 18:07.100
Not me.
-But I need you to--
I need you to man up

18:07.133 --> 18:10.500
and say, "What's best
for my kids?"

18:10.533 --> 18:14.767
Okay? So... think about it.
Maybe you could sleep
at a friend's house tonight

18:14.800 --> 18:17.067
or something, and then
come back tomorrow
and apologize to 'em.

18:17.067 --> 18:18.967
-I tried to do my best.
You know?
-All right.

18:19.067 --> 18:20.633
I'm not saying you have
to leave forever,

18:20.667 --> 18:22.933
I'm just sayin',
a little cool-down period
would probably help.

18:22.967 --> 18:25.333
-I'm cooled down...
I don't fight.
You know?

18:25.367 --> 18:27.267
-The sister is gonna
take Mom.

18:27.300 --> 18:28.967
-(indistinct)
-What's that?

18:29.067 --> 18:30.500
-(indistinct)
-Yeah.

18:30.533 --> 18:32.700
-They'll leave. They'll leave.

18:32.733 --> 18:34.333
-Sister will take boys
and Mom.

18:34.367 --> 18:36.133
-Okay. You wanna
say goodbye to them...

18:36.167 --> 18:38.267
for the night?
They're leavin' for the night.

18:38.300 --> 18:42.133
-Oh... listen,
my thing is, I don't want
these problems, okay?

18:42.167 --> 18:44.667
-I don't think anybody
wants these problems, man.

18:44.700 --> 18:47.267
Do you want to talk to them
and tell them goodbye?

18:47.300 --> 18:48.767
Do you wanna talk
to your wife at all?

18:48.800 --> 18:51.900
-If they wanna leave,
I mean, that's up to them
and you guys.

18:51.933 --> 18:53.233
Okay?
-Okay.

18:53.267 --> 18:55.633
I'm not fighting at all.
I don't wanna keep anybody

18:55.667 --> 19:00.600
with an argument.
We don't have to do stuff
like this.

19:00.633 --> 19:01.633
-All right, man.
-Okay?

19:01.667 --> 19:04.300
-I'm gonna go
talk to them quick.

19:04.333 --> 19:07.700
All right, guys. I know
that this isn't the ideal
situation, and I know

19:07.733 --> 19:09.500
Mom and Dad
aren't gettin' along.

19:09.533 --> 19:13.067
And... maybe you guys
might wanna limit
the alcohol,

19:13.067 --> 19:15.067
since everybody's
not gettin' along.
I know that it was

19:15.067 --> 19:18.333
a fun time at first,
but sometimes alcohol
does things

19:18.367 --> 19:21.467
to people, and you may not
wanna do that anymore, okay?

19:21.500 --> 19:24.633
I mean, if you look at
what's happened.
-Exactly, yes.

19:24.667 --> 19:27.433
-It's-- It's obviously hurt
your kids more than physical,

19:27.467 --> 19:29.300
but it's mental now.
-Mental, yeah, guys...

19:29.333 --> 19:32.333
-So, you might wanna try to get,
uh, some counseling.
-Okay.

19:32.367 --> 19:35.167
-But, um... this
punchin' the fence,

19:35.200 --> 19:37.267
and look what happened
to your hands, man.
-That's it.

19:37.300 --> 19:41.933
-Like... I mean, nice hit,
you broke the board, but...
go to a gym or somethin'.

19:41.967 --> 19:43.267
All right?
-Mm-hmm.

19:43.300 --> 19:44.533
-All right, guys.

19:45.733 --> 19:47.900
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:47.933 --> 19:49.867
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:49.900 --> 19:51.067
Cover is code three.

19:51.067 --> 19:54.067
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

19:58.733 --> 20:01.900
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:01.933 --> 20:03.100
-(theme music playing)
