00:13.999 --> 00:14.999
- Previously on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

00:14.999 --> 00:16.999
Stassi's back,
and if she comes back here,

00:16.999 --> 00:18.999
she's gonna have to come
through me first.

00:18.999 --> 00:20.999
All I ever wanted
Stassi to do

00:20.999 --> 00:23.999
was to acknowledge exactly
what I did for her.

00:23.999 --> 00:25.999
- Welcome to Hawaii, guys.

00:25.999 --> 00:28.999
- My mom sent me screenshots
of, like, the whole conversation

00:28.999 --> 00:29.999
that her and Scheana had.

00:29.999 --> 00:32.000
- He's very good
at convincing her

00:32.999 --> 00:33.999
of what he wants.

00:33.999 --> 00:35.999
- I'm sorry.
Does the truth hurt?

00:35.999 --> 00:36.999
- No, no, no.

00:36.999 --> 00:39.999
- If you are worried about me,
talk to me.

00:39.999 --> 00:42.999
Talk to Tom.
Don't talk to my f***ing mom.

00:42.999 --> 00:44.999
- You remember Kevin,
Jax's old friend?

00:44.999 --> 00:46.999
- It's been brought
to our attention

00:46.999 --> 00:47.999
that you have a girlfriend.

00:47.999 --> 00:48.999
- I have an ex-girlfriend.

00:48.999 --> 00:51.999
- The whole sex tape thing
shook my world.

00:51.999 --> 00:52.999
- Scheana was wrong.

00:52.999 --> 00:54.999
I know for a fact
that she showed it to people.

00:54.999 --> 00:56.999
- I've compromised a lot
of my friendships.

00:56.999 --> 00:58.000
- She walked away
from my friendship.

00:58.999 --> 00:59.999
She said f*** you.
- From everything.

00:59.999 --> 01:01.999
- I just want her to stay
as far away from me as possible.

01:01.999 --> 01:02.999
- They're like, "Oh,
you're wasted, you're wasted."

01:02.999 --> 01:04.999
I was like, "No, I'm not."

01:04.999 --> 01:05.999
- I can tell when you drink
a little too much,

01:05.999 --> 01:06.999
'cause you get a look
in your eyes

01:06.999 --> 01:08.999
and you get an attitude.

01:08.999 --> 01:09.999
- I was fine until you
started bringing it up.

01:09.999 --> 01:10.999
- Seriously?

01:10.999 --> 01:12.999
- The bail is $11,000.

01:12.999 --> 01:14.999
- Jax has to ruin it
for all of us

01:14.999 --> 01:16.999
and get arrested.

01:17.999 --> 01:20.000
- Yeah.

01:21.999 --> 01:22.999
- Mm-hmm.

I don't have anything.

02:05.999 --> 02:08.999
I don't have a toothbrush.

02:08.999 --> 02:10.999
I mean, Tom and Ariana, I guess,
are bringing my bags back.

02:10.999 --> 02:12.999
- Yeah.

02:12.999 --> 02:13.999
- Thank God
my friends were there.

02:13.999 --> 02:15.999
- I know.
- Thank God Tom was there.

02:15.999 --> 02:18.000
Thank Go Scheana was there.
Thank God Katie was there.

02:18.999 --> 02:19.999
- I know.

02:19.999 --> 02:20.999
- I don't know
what you would have done.

02:20.999 --> 02:21.999
- No, I don't know
what I would have done

02:21.999 --> 02:22.999
without them being there.

02:22.999 --> 02:23.999
- Like, I don't even
know what to say.

02:23.999 --> 02:25.999
I don't even know what to--

02:25.999 --> 02:27.999
Over a pair of sunglasses.

02:27.999 --> 02:28.999
- I know.

02:28.999 --> 02:30.999
- It wasn't about,
oh, I have no money,

02:30.999 --> 02:32.999
and I need to--
I need to take some glasses

02:32.999 --> 02:34.999
so I can show my girlfriend
that I care for her.

02:34.999 --> 02:36.999
It wasn't about that.

02:36.999 --> 02:39.999
I don't know--

02:39.999 --> 02:43.999
Probably the most painful thing
I had to see was her face.

02:43.999 --> 02:45.999
Her looking at me
in sheer disappointment.

02:52.999 --> 02:54.999
I'm sorry.
I'm really embarrassed.

02:54.999 --> 02:56.999
- I mean, it was kind of--
- I don't know why I did that.

02:56.999 --> 02:57.999
I really don't.
Like, I--

02:57.999 --> 02:59.999
- I know you are a good man.
It's not about that.

02:59.999 --> 03:04.999
It's just, like, sometimes you
don't make the right choices.

03:04.999 --> 03:06.999
- It's not me that I'm upset
about right now.

03:06.999 --> 03:08.999
It's the other people.
I can--

03:08.999 --> 03:10.999
I can take care of myself.

03:10.999 --> 03:12.999
I can sit in jail,
whatever, whatever.

03:12.999 --> 03:14.999
It's the other people
that I hurt.

03:14.999 --> 03:15.999
You just got here.

03:15.999 --> 03:17.999
Like, this is not
what you signed up for.

03:17.999 --> 03:19.999
- You're just gonna have
to prove yourself to me,

03:19.999 --> 03:21.999
to your mom,
to everybody.

03:21.999 --> 03:22.999
I mean, you just
gotta make sure

03:22.999 --> 03:25.999
that nothing like this
ever happens again.

03:25.999 --> 03:26.999
- I'm sorry.

03:28.999 --> 03:29.999
I think I see
my phone lighting up.

03:29.999 --> 03:31.999
I think Ariana's here.

03:34.999 --> 03:35.999
Yeah, okay.

03:35.999 --> 03:37.999
I'm gonna run down there
and get my bags.

03:37.999 --> 03:38.999
- Okay.

03:38.999 --> 03:40.999
- Pfft.

03:40.999 --> 03:43.999
This is the consequence
of getting arrested in Hawaii.

03:43.999 --> 03:45.999
Your "friend" who doesn't even
really like you all that much

03:45.999 --> 03:47.999
most of the time

03:47.999 --> 03:51.999
has to lug this 80-pound bag

03:51.999 --> 03:53.999
back to your apartment
in Koreatown.

03:53.999 --> 03:54.999
It's really heavy.
- Thank you, thank you.

03:54.999 --> 03:57.000
- We put all your stuff
into one bag.

03:57.999 --> 03:58.999
- I really appreciate
you and Tom.

03:58.999 --> 04:00.000
I know Tom's not here--I think
he's at the gym or something.

04:00.999 --> 04:01.000
- Yeah.

04:01.999 --> 04:02.999
- I ruined
everyone's last day,

04:02.999 --> 04:03.999
because they were
all trying to figure out

04:03.999 --> 04:05.999
how to get me
out of my situation.

04:05.999 --> 04:06.999
- The only thing that was
a pain in the ass about it

04:06.999 --> 04:08.999
was we rented a car
so we could sightsee

04:08.999 --> 04:10.999
on our last day,
'cause we had a late flight.

04:10.999 --> 04:11.999
Saw some sights.

04:11.999 --> 04:13.999
We swam with some sharks.

04:13.999 --> 04:16.999
- Oh, man, I wanted
to do all that.

04:16.999 --> 04:18.999
I'm so sorry.

04:18.999 --> 04:20.999
Tell Tom thank you so much.
Thank you guys again.

04:20.999 --> 04:21.999
- You're welcome.

04:21.999 --> 04:23.999
- I'll see you
on the flip side.

04:23.999 --> 04:24.999
- Bye.

04:24.999 --> 04:26.999
- Jesus, what's in this thing?

04:26.999 --> 04:28.999
Dead bodies?
- Yeah.

04:28.999 --> 04:29.999
- Lots of sunglasses.

04:29.999 --> 04:32.999
- Oh, lord.
Don't even joke about that.

04:40.999 --> 04:43.999
- He stole a $350 pair
of sunglasses.

04:43.999 --> 04:44.999
- No.
- In Hawaii.

04:44.999 --> 04:46.999
- The bail was 11,000.

04:46.999 --> 04:48.999
- 11,000?
What?

04:48.999 --> 04:50.999
- Everyone, hold on
to your belongings.

04:51.999 --> 04:52.999
- He gave them
to his girlfriend,

04:52.999 --> 04:53.999
and his girlfriend was,
like,

04:53.999 --> 04:55.999
posting Instagram
pictures with them.

05:01.999 --> 05:05.999
- What f***ing 36-year-old man
steals sunglasses?

05:05.999 --> 05:06.999
- What the hell
were you thinking?

05:06.999 --> 05:08.999
He's got to be a klepto.
Like, a kleptomaniac.

05:08.999 --> 05:10.999
Like, he's just got to
f***ing steal something

05:10.999 --> 05:11.999
for the rush of it.

05:11.999 --> 05:12.999
- For a minute
I was like,

05:12.999 --> 05:15.999
this guy is, like--
he's a good-looking dude.

05:15.999 --> 05:17.999
After this trip,
I'm like,

05:17.999 --> 05:20.999
"You could not be
any more unattractive to me."

05:20.999 --> 05:23.999
There is nothing hot about
a dude straight out of jail

05:23.999 --> 05:26.999
because he stole
a pair of sunglasses.

05:26.999 --> 05:28.999
Like, pass him to Brittany.
"Handle this."

05:28.999 --> 05:31.999
If he was, like,
some sexy drug dealer,

05:31.999 --> 05:34.999
had a sh** ton of money,
that's hot.

05:34.999 --> 05:38.999
You stealing sunglasses
is lame as f***.

05:38.999 --> 05:39.999
- To be a f***ing dumbass,

05:39.999 --> 05:41.999
I mean, don't go getting
caught, you idiot.

05:41.999 --> 05:43.999
- He's just f*** up
in the head, dude.

05:46.999 --> 05:47.999
- Hello.

05:47.999 --> 05:49.999
- Hey.
How's it going?

05:49.999 --> 05:51.999
- Oh, my God, I just came
from Jax's house.

05:51.999 --> 05:52.999
I didn't really know
what to say.

05:52.999 --> 05:54.999
- It seems like it's his
favorite way to learn.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.999
- The hard way?
- Yeah.

05:56.999 --> 05:59.999
The best-case scenario
is that Jax is gonna wind up

05:59.999 --> 06:02.999
on probation for
a really long time,

06:02.999 --> 06:06.999
and Jax is not good
at being good.

06:06.999 --> 06:07.999
He's in trouble here.

06:07.999 --> 06:09.999
- I can't believe
that I would even

06:09.999 --> 06:11.999
do such a favor
for Jax.

06:11.999 --> 06:14.999
I did, so he better not
act like a dick

06:14.999 --> 06:16.999
ever again to me.

06:27.999 --> 06:29.999
- It's open.

06:29.999 --> 06:31.999
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

06:31.999 --> 06:34.999
- Hi. You guys look
bronzed and beautiful.

06:34.999 --> 06:35.999
- Well, you know--
- I know.

06:35.999 --> 06:37.999
It got to the point where
I had to stop laying out

06:37.999 --> 06:38.999
because I was so tan.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.999
- Oh, my God,
that's rough.

06:40.999 --> 06:41.999
- You look a little...

06:41.999 --> 06:43.999
Rusty.
- Stressed.

06:43.999 --> 06:45.999
- It's been, what, a year
since you've waited tables?

06:45.999 --> 06:48.999
You must have forgotten
how to carry a few plates.

06:48.999 --> 06:49.999
- I forgot everything.

06:49.999 --> 06:54.999
Okay, so I have, like,
a billion f'ing questions.

06:54.999 --> 06:57.999
What the hell happened
with Jax?

06:57.999 --> 07:00.999
- It's one thing to "borrow"

07:00.999 --> 07:02.999
of couple bottles
of Vanderpump Vodka.

07:02.999 --> 07:06.999
It's another to steal designer
sunglasses from a store.

07:06.999 --> 07:10.999
- I literally woke up
to a text

07:10.999 --> 07:12.999
from my girlfriend
Cristina.

07:12.999 --> 07:13.999
Like, "I heard this and that
on social media.

07:13.999 --> 07:15.999
Jax got arrested."
I'm like, "What?"

07:15.999 --> 07:17.999
I'm like, "What are you
talking about right now?"

07:17.999 --> 07:19.999
- Yeah, class C felony.
- Class C felony.

07:19.999 --> 07:20.999
- He is so f***ed.

07:20.999 --> 07:22.999
Jax doesn't think.
He doesn't think.

07:22.999 --> 07:23.999
One thing we know about Jax

07:23.999 --> 07:26.999
is that Jax has
zero impulse control.

07:26.999 --> 07:28.999
I just never thought he'd, like,
take it to this level.

07:28.999 --> 07:29.999
Like, he ruined
his own birthday.

07:29.999 --> 07:30.999
- Mm-hmm.

07:30.999 --> 07:32.999
So how has it been
hanging with Kevin?

07:32.999 --> 07:33.999
Did he move in
all of his stuff?

07:33.999 --> 07:36.999
- Kevin's decided
to stay in town.

07:36.999 --> 07:37.999
- Uh-huh.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.999
- Until I don't know when.

07:39.999 --> 07:41.999
Before Jax went to Hawaii,

07:41.999 --> 07:43.999
Jax introduced me
to this friend, Kevin.

07:43.999 --> 07:44.999
We hit it off.

07:44.999 --> 07:47.999
It's like a little single
summer fling.

07:47.999 --> 07:50.999
- Probably making Stassi
feel weird now.

07:50.999 --> 07:51.999
- This is why I watch porn.

07:51.999 --> 07:53.999
- Few nights' stand.

07:53.999 --> 07:55.999
Until he started squatting
in my apartment.

07:55.999 --> 07:58.999
So he's been
kicking it here,

07:58.999 --> 08:01.000
and I get a text, like,

08:01.000 --> 08:02.999
this is the best week
of his life.

08:02.999 --> 08:03.999
That he was
in love with me.

08:03.999 --> 08:04.999
What?

08:04.999 --> 08:06.000
- Yeah, I don't know how
to tell him to leave.

08:06.999 --> 08:07.999
I don't know how
to tell him to slow down.

08:07.999 --> 08:09.999
I don't know, I gotta have
the talk, I guess.

08:09.999 --> 08:11.999
I know I'm f***ing awesome.

08:11.999 --> 08:12.999
I know that I'm
a great catch,

08:12.999 --> 08:15.999
but, Kevin, back off.

08:15.999 --> 08:18.999
Anyways, what happened
with you and Ariana and Shay--

08:18.999 --> 08:20.999
- Yeah, I'll fill you
in briefly,

08:20.999 --> 08:23.999
'cause I just feel weird
talking about them with you.

08:23.999 --> 08:26.999
So it's just this whole big
thing that it didn't need to be.

08:26.999 --> 08:28.999
- Ariana told me
that her mom hit you up.

08:28.999 --> 08:30.999
- His cocky attitude rubs off,

08:30.999 --> 08:32.999
and you guys have this "we're
better than everyone" attitude.

08:32.999 --> 08:33.999
- Are you kidding me?

08:33.999 --> 08:35.999
Like, what kind of friend
have I been to you

08:35.999 --> 08:37.999
in the past, like,
couple years?

08:37.999 --> 08:39.999
- I'm not sorry
that I sent those texts.

08:39.999 --> 08:41.999
I'm not sorry
for what I said.

08:41.999 --> 08:42.999
The only thing
I am sorry for

08:42.999 --> 08:44.999
is that it hurt
Sandoval's feelings.

08:44.999 --> 08:46.999
I ended up just having
to apologize for everything,

08:46.999 --> 08:48.999
even things I didn't want
to apologize for,

08:48.999 --> 08:50.999
because it was a battle
I was never gonna win.

08:50.999 --> 08:53.999
- If she's your best friend,
why the f*** would she get mad

08:53.999 --> 08:54.999
that you talked to her mother?

08:54.999 --> 08:56.999
- It was Tom who got mad.
- Right.

08:56.999 --> 08:58.999
So then, what, she gets mad
because Tom's mad,

08:58.999 --> 08:59.999
because she can't have
her own f***ing opinion?

08:59.999 --> 09:02.999
- It's weird, it feels like
the roles between Kristen

09:02.999 --> 09:03.999
and Ariana have reversed.

09:03.999 --> 09:05.999
Ariana used to be
the cool, fun chick.

09:05.999 --> 09:07.999
Kristen was
the spiteful, angry one.

09:07.999 --> 09:11.999
And now the roles
have switched.

09:11.999 --> 09:13.999
- Stassi actually came over.

09:13.999 --> 09:15.999
First time she's ever
been to my house.

09:15.999 --> 09:17.999
We talked a lot about you.

09:17.999 --> 09:19.999
I know she wants
to talk to you.

09:19.999 --> 09:21.999
- No.

09:21.999 --> 09:22.999
- She misses you
and Schwartz.

09:22.999 --> 09:24.999
- Of course she does.
She's an amazing f***ing friend.

09:24.999 --> 09:25.999
She should miss her.

09:25.999 --> 09:26.999
- I, like, moved on
with my life,

09:26.999 --> 09:28.999
and I'm happier.

09:28.999 --> 09:29.999
I have friends
that actually appreciate

09:29.999 --> 09:30.999
and value my friendship,

09:30.999 --> 09:32.999
and she doesn't
deserve any of that.

09:32.999 --> 09:35.999
- We, me, Jax and others

09:35.999 --> 09:36.999
don't want her around.

09:36.999 --> 09:38.999
So she will not
be welcomed at all.

09:38.999 --> 09:39.999
She doesn't deserve it.

09:39.999 --> 09:42.999
- I feel like she's gonna
try to come around.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.999
- If I were you,
I'd stay away.

09:46.999 --> 09:48.999
- People get drunk all the time,
and they don't steal things.

09:48.999 --> 09:50.999
Don't try to pull the wool
over my eyes.

09:58.999 --> 10:02.999
♪ I can't let you go ♪

10:02.999 --> 10:05.999
♪ I'm addicted
to the bad boys ♪

10:05.999 --> 10:08.999
- Hi, welcome to Hooters.
- Hi, welcome to Hooters.

10:08.999 --> 10:10.999
- I'm not a big
believer in fate,

10:10.999 --> 10:12.999
but you ending up with
a girl that works at Hooters

10:12.999 --> 10:14.999
is starting to make me
rethink things.

10:14.999 --> 10:15.999
- Uh-oh.
- Hey!

10:15.999 --> 10:17.999
- There she is.
- Hi, guys.

10:17.999 --> 10:19.999
- How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

10:19.999 --> 10:20.999
- That's my baby.

10:20.999 --> 10:22.999
I'm not just your average
Hooters customer.

10:22.999 --> 10:24.999
I'm a VIP patron.

10:24.999 --> 10:25.999
50% off.

10:25.999 --> 10:27.999
- Well, thanks for coming
on my first day.

10:27.999 --> 10:29.999
- Of course I'm here
to support you.

10:29.999 --> 10:31.999
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, God!

10:31.999 --> 10:33.999
- The way Brittany has been
handling this is great.

10:33.999 --> 10:36.999
Standing by my side and
dealing with all this mess.

10:36.999 --> 10:38.999
- You said, "I promise,
I'm gonna f*** you."

10:38.999 --> 10:40.999
- No, I never said that.
- Oh, my God.

10:40.999 --> 10:42.999
Oh, my God!
- I never said that.

10:42.999 --> 10:44.999
I'm sure if this happened
when I was dating Stassi,

10:44.999 --> 10:46.999
I'd want to go back to jail,
throw away the key.

10:46.999 --> 10:47.999
- What do you all
want to drink?

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
- I'm not even
thinking about drinking.

10:49.999 --> 10:50.999
Actually,
Peter just called me,

10:50.999 --> 10:51.999
and I have to go meet
with Lisa later.

10:51.999 --> 10:53.000
- She's not gonna be happy,

10:53.000 --> 10:54.999
'cause this reflects poorly
on her brand.

10:54.999 --> 10:56.999
- We were in Hawaii
having fun.

10:56.999 --> 10:58.999
- I know,
but it's a felony, dude.

10:58.999 --> 10:59.999
- It's intimidating
going into Villa Rosa.

10:59.999 --> 11:00.999
She's gonna
let you have it.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.999
- It literally is
like Castle Grayskull.

11:02.999 --> 11:04.999
Remember He-Man?
Remember, like, Skeletor?

11:04.999 --> 11:05.999
- Brittany, we're about to
splurge, 'cause it's on him.

11:05.999 --> 11:06.999
- Okay.

11:06.999 --> 11:09.000
- We bailed his ass
out of jail, so, uh...

11:09.000 --> 11:10.999
- Dude,
ten Triple Dog Dare.

11:10.999 --> 11:12.999
- Oh, yeah.
- Honey barbecue?

11:13.000 --> 11:14.999
- There's not honey barbecue.
Honey chipotle's good.

11:14.999 --> 11:16.999
- Let's do chipotle honey, Tom.
- Okay.

11:16.999 --> 11:18.999
- Brittany, can I get
a buffalo chicken sandwich?

11:18.999 --> 11:19.999
No ranch.

11:19.999 --> 11:20.999
- All right, well, let me get
your drinks and stuff, okay?

11:20.999 --> 11:22.999
- All right.
Great job, baby.

11:22.999 --> 11:23.999
I'm proud of you.
- Well, thank you!

11:23.999 --> 11:24.999
- Okay.

11:24.999 --> 11:25.999
I'm sorry,
the last time I was here,

11:25.999 --> 11:27.999
I don't remember the girls
being this attractive.

11:27.999 --> 11:28.999
- So you spent--

11:29.000 --> 11:31.999
- I have to take this.
I'll be right back.

11:31.999 --> 11:33.999
Hello?

11:35.999 --> 11:38.999
You've got a warrant
for what?

11:40.999 --> 11:44.999
No, no, I'm in California.

11:44.999 --> 11:46.999
Yeah, but my lawyers
are taking care of it.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.999
- I know, man.
- I just feel drained.

11:48.999 --> 11:51.999
We dedicated the remainder
of our trip to that,

11:51.999 --> 11:54.999
getting his ass
out of jail.

11:54.999 --> 11:55.999
Any good news?

11:55.999 --> 11:58.999
- Oh, just, you know,
lawyer talk.

11:58.999 --> 12:00.999
- Oh, he's a lawyer--it wasn't
your probation officer?

12:00.999 --> 12:02.999
- I don't have one of those.
- You're gonna have one.

12:02.999 --> 12:03.999
- You do realize
it's a pair of sunglasses.

12:03.999 --> 12:05.000
It's not a car.
I didn't rob a bank.

12:05.999 --> 12:06.999
- It can be hard
for Jax to admit

12:06.999 --> 12:08.999
of ashamed he is.

12:08.999 --> 12:11.999
I think he'd rather just be
the mayor of Hooterville

12:11.999 --> 12:13.999
than to own up to that.

12:13.999 --> 12:14.999
- All right,
I have the wings.

12:14.999 --> 12:16.999
- Oh, whoa.
- We're gonna have to make room.

12:16.999 --> 12:17.999
- Thank you so much.
- What's that one?

12:17.999 --> 12:20.999
- Breaded hot.
That's what Jax wanted.

12:20.999 --> 12:21.999
- Thank you.

12:23.999 --> 12:24.999
- You know my friend Kevin?

12:24.999 --> 12:27.999
- Your friend Kevin that was,
like, banging Kristen?

12:27.999 --> 12:29.999
- He won't leave.
He's been here all the time.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.999
He hasn't gone home yet.
He's still here.

12:47.999 --> 12:48.999
- Puuhh.

12:48.999 --> 12:51.999
Come in!

12:51.999 --> 12:52.999
- Hello.
- Hi.

12:52.999 --> 12:53.999
- Hello.
- Hey, what's up, Stassi?

12:53.999 --> 12:57.999
- Wine, mimosas, tequila,
or D, all of the above?

12:57.999 --> 12:58.999
- I'm on antibiotics,
so wine.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.999
- Are you guys really sure

13:00.999 --> 13:02.999
that wine has to deal
with antibiotics?

13:02.999 --> 13:04.999
- I just feel like
it's the most organic-y thing.

13:04.999 --> 13:06.999
Like, it's made from grapes.

13:06.999 --> 13:08.999
- Especially
after a breakup.

13:08.999 --> 13:10.999
- Especially after a breakup.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.999
Patrick and I have been
so up and down,

13:12.999 --> 13:15.999
and we've broken up
a million times.

13:15.999 --> 13:16.999
- Come on over.

13:16.999 --> 13:18.999
- I don't want to get
in between you two lovebirds.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.999
I've dated so many ass****s,

13:20.999 --> 13:22.999
and I finally have
a good guy,

13:22.999 --> 13:23.999
and I can't make it work.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.999
Maybe that means
I'm the ass****.

13:25.999 --> 13:27.000
When I'm in
a relationship,

13:27.999 --> 13:29.999
like that person
is my everything.

13:29.999 --> 13:32.999
I will give up anything
for love.

13:32.999 --> 13:34.999
- But there's nothing wrong
with that though.

13:34.999 --> 13:35.999
That's a good--
There is.

13:35.999 --> 13:36.999
- There is though.
There is.

13:36.999 --> 13:37.999
- 'Cause when you lose
yourself to someone--

13:37.999 --> 13:39.999
- And I lost myself and I--

13:39.999 --> 13:42.999
- That's the worst thing you--
- I kinda know how that feels.

13:42.999 --> 13:43.999
- Homey, you've been here
for a week.

13:43.999 --> 13:45.999
Are you serious?

13:45.999 --> 13:46.999
There's no way
you're losing yourself yet.

13:46.999 --> 13:48.000
Give yourself
a good month.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.999
- All right.
- Okay?

13:49.999 --> 13:52.999
I understand this Kevin fellow
is Jax's friend,

13:52.999 --> 13:54.000
but he might also be
his doppelganger,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.999
like moving right in after,
like, a week and a half.

13:56.999 --> 13:58.999
What is wrong
with these people?

13:58.999 --> 14:01.999
- This whole stealing
sunglasses bullsh**.

14:01.999 --> 14:02.999
- You know Jax.
He steals.

14:02.999 --> 14:05.999
My dad called me yesterday
and he's like,

14:05.999 --> 14:08.999
"When you brought Jax to
New Orleans for Christmas--"

14:08.999 --> 14:12.999
My dad's girlfriend
had all of these expensive,

14:12.999 --> 14:15.999
like, Asian provocateur
stockings,

14:15.999 --> 14:17.999
and those were all missing.

14:17.999 --> 14:18.999
So he had to have
given them--

14:18.999 --> 14:19.999
- Did he ever give
any of these to you?

14:20.000 --> 14:21.999
- No, he had to have
given them to the girls

14:21.999 --> 14:24.999
he was cheating on me with,
'cause I didn't get 'em.

14:24.999 --> 14:26.999
Everybody knows
that he steals.

14:26.999 --> 14:27.999
I'm ready to get rid of this.

14:27.999 --> 14:29.999
- Memories.
- Memories.

14:29.999 --> 14:30.999
- He literally stole this
for me, like,

14:30.999 --> 14:32.999
the first week
we were dating.

14:32.999 --> 14:33.999
Like, how romantic.

14:33.999 --> 14:36.999
This was stolen,
but I grew attached to it

14:36.999 --> 14:38.999
before I realized
that it was stolen.

14:38.999 --> 14:40.999
So, like,
I feel like it's mine.

14:40.999 --> 14:42.999
I didn't steal it.

14:42.999 --> 14:45.999
It's just such a classic.

14:45.999 --> 14:47.999
- You know, I'm not gonna throw
my friend under the bus,

14:47.999 --> 14:48.999
but Brittany doesn't lie,

14:48.999 --> 14:49.999
and Kevin told Brittany

14:49.999 --> 14:52.999
that he kinda lives
with his girlfriend.

14:54.999 --> 14:55.999
You wanna have a girlfriend,

14:55.999 --> 14:57.999
two girlfriends,
three girlfriends,

14:57.999 --> 14:59.999
and hook up with
a girlfriend on the side, cool.

14:59.999 --> 15:01.999
Dude, go for it.
That's your business.

15:01.999 --> 15:04.999
'Cause God knows
I've done my fair share

15:04.999 --> 15:06.999
of those kind of things.

15:06.999 --> 15:08.999
And the thing is,
I think she knew.

15:08.999 --> 15:09.999
I think she's just trying
to look good in front of Stassi.

15:09.999 --> 15:12.999
- There is no
"I think she knew."

15:12.999 --> 15:14.999
She knew.
She full-blown f***ing knew.

15:14.999 --> 15:18.999
Kevin was talking about
his girlfriend

15:18.999 --> 15:20.999
in front of you,
in front of Kristen.

15:20.999 --> 15:23.000
- Jax, you know that
he had a girlfriend.

15:23.999 --> 15:25.999
He told us in Huntington.
You were right there with me.

15:25.999 --> 15:27.999
And I remember
Kristen being like,

15:27.999 --> 15:28.999
"You have a girlfriend?"

15:28.999 --> 15:31.999
- Then later that night,
Kristen hooked up with him.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.999
- She's used to that.

15:33.999 --> 15:34.999
Don't say she's used to that.

15:34.999 --> 15:36.999
- She is.

15:36.999 --> 15:37.999
- Dude, when me and Kristen
started hooking up,

15:37.999 --> 15:39.999
she had a boyfriend
the entire time.

15:39.999 --> 15:42.999
This is after, like, probably
the fourth time we had had sex.

15:42.999 --> 15:45.999
She's like, "I have a
boyfriend," and then kissed me.

15:45.999 --> 15:47.999
- It's kind of complicated.

15:47.999 --> 15:49.999
- Jesus,
that's an understatement.

15:49.999 --> 15:52.999
Sometimes I wonder,
are Jax and Kristen soul mates?

15:52.999 --> 15:53.999
Are they?

15:53.999 --> 15:55.999
- He knew the secret, dude.

15:55.999 --> 15:56.999
All you have to do
is give Kristen a compliment,

15:56.999 --> 15:58.999
then those panties drop
immediately.

16:01.999 --> 16:03.999
- You know that place
we had brunch the other day?

16:03.999 --> 16:04.999
- Yeah.

16:04.999 --> 16:05.999
- Do you wanna go get us
some lunch?

16:05.999 --> 16:06.999
- I can do that.
You know what I'll do?

16:06.999 --> 16:08.999
I'll text you the menu
when I get there

16:08.999 --> 16:09.999
so you guys can
tell me what you want.

16:09.999 --> 16:10.999
- Perfect.
- Yeah, that's what's up.

16:10.999 --> 16:11.999
- And then I'll bring it back.
- Perfect.

16:11.999 --> 16:12.999
- All right.
- Thank you so much.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.999
- No problem.

16:17.999 --> 16:19.999
- I liked him until he became
a state five clinger.

16:19.999 --> 16:21.999
- I'm sorry,
he just sat here and I'm like,

16:21.999 --> 16:23.999
"You know, I just, like,
lost myself in love,"

16:23.999 --> 16:25.999
and he's like, "I know."

16:25.999 --> 16:27.999
Please don't compare
your week-long romance

16:27.999 --> 16:29.999
to my two-year relationship.

16:29.999 --> 16:30.999
- You feeling okay?

16:30.999 --> 16:33.999
- I was sobbing
all of yesterday.

16:33.999 --> 16:35.999
I don't know,
in, like, a different time

16:35.999 --> 16:37.999
if I had my sh** together,
you know what I mean,

16:37.999 --> 16:39.999
it would make this
so much easier,

16:39.999 --> 16:41.999
but, like, I don't have
my own place right now.

16:41.999 --> 16:43.999
My life's just kind of,
like, up in the air,

16:43.999 --> 16:45.999
and I'm, like,
I'm kind of over it.

16:45.999 --> 16:49.999
- I'm actually gonna
snag Kev's spare key

16:49.999 --> 16:51.999
off his little
rental car key chain

16:51.999 --> 16:53.999
so you can have it
tonight.

16:53.999 --> 16:56.999
- Oh, am I moving in?

16:56.999 --> 16:57.999
- Obviously you can stay here.

16:57.999 --> 16:59.999
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:59.999 --> 17:02.999
Did Kristen just offer
to let me stay here?

17:02.999 --> 17:04.999
- Yes, I did have sex
with him one time.

17:04.999 --> 17:06.999
- You had sex with Jax?
- Yes.

17:06.999 --> 17:08.999
- I hate her,
I hate her, I hate her.

17:08.999 --> 17:12.000
I want to wrap
a dildo in acid

17:12.999 --> 17:15.999
and give it to Kristen
as a present.

17:15.999 --> 17:17.999
And am I actually
thinking about it?

17:18.999 --> 17:19.999
Okay.

17:19.999 --> 17:21.999
- You and I are gonna
snuggle in my bed.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.999
- I'm really good
at cuddling.

17:23.999 --> 17:26.999
- And Kev can have
a little blanket

17:26.999 --> 17:28.999
and throw pillows
and sleep out here.

17:28.999 --> 17:29.999
- Mm-hmm.
- Sorry, bro.

17:29.999 --> 17:31.999
- Hos before bros.
It's just standard.

17:31.999 --> 17:33.999
- So that's gonna happen.

17:33.999 --> 17:34.999
- I don't know
if this says more

17:34.999 --> 17:36.999
about where I'm at
with Kristen

17:36.999 --> 17:39.999
or where I'm at in my life.

17:39.999 --> 17:41.999
- ♪ Get the group
back together again ♪

17:55.999 --> 17:58.999
- Hello.
- Hi. I'm here to see Lisa.

17:58.999 --> 17:59.999
- Have a seat, please.
- All right, thanks.

17:59.999 --> 18:02.999
- Okay.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.999
- You know, generally Lisa
and I have this relationship

18:04.999 --> 18:06.999
where she usually loves
when I screw up.

18:06.999 --> 18:07.999
She thinks it's humorous.

18:07.999 --> 18:09.999
- Where is he?
I wanna f***ing kill him.

18:14.999 --> 18:16.999
- Coming up...

18:16.999 --> 18:19.999
Make me understand
why I can justify

18:19.999 --> 18:22.999
keeping you
in our employment.

18:30.999 --> 18:33.999
- Where is he?
I wanna f***ing kill him.

18:33.999 --> 18:35.999
- Hi.

18:35.999 --> 18:36.999
- Jax.

18:36.999 --> 18:38.999
I'd offer you a drink,

18:38.999 --> 18:40.999
but I don't think
you deserve one.

18:42.999 --> 18:44.999
Go on then.
Tell me.

18:44.999 --> 18:46.999
- Well, I'm sure
you've heard by now.

18:46.999 --> 18:48.999
- I've heard everything.

18:48.999 --> 18:49.999
- I was...drunk.

18:49.999 --> 18:51.999
- That sounds like
absolute bullsh** to me,

18:51.999 --> 18:52.999
and I'll tell you why--

18:53.000 --> 18:54.999
- I blew over the legal limit.
I couldn't even--

18:54.999 --> 18:56.999
- Now you're telling me
you're drunk.

18:56.999 --> 18:57.999
You're either a liar, you're
a drunk, or you're a thief.

18:57.999 --> 18:59.999
What is it, Jax?

18:59.999 --> 19:01.999
Don't try and pull the wool
over my eyes.

19:01.999 --> 19:04.000
This is the time for you
to admit what you've done,

19:04.000 --> 19:05.999
put your hands up--

19:05.999 --> 19:06.999
- I know what I did was wrong.
I know that.

19:06.999 --> 19:08.999
- How many times have you
stolen from people?

19:08.999 --> 19:09.999
- Do you wanna glass of wine?

19:09.999 --> 19:12.000
- Did you take this,
or was this a gift?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.999
- Lisa may or may not know
that I have this bottle.

19:14.999 --> 19:17.999
All this silverware is--

19:17.999 --> 19:18.999
is from Sur.

19:18.999 --> 19:20.999
- I take it
they're not gifts.

19:20.999 --> 19:21.999
- Jason had
a little girlfriend,

19:21.999 --> 19:24.999
and he stole
his sister's cross.

19:24.999 --> 19:26.999
- You know he still does that?
- No, I don't!

19:26.999 --> 19:27.999
How many times?

19:27.999 --> 19:28.999
- Yes.
How many times, Jax?

19:28.999 --> 19:30.999
- This is the--

19:30.999 --> 19:33.999
- You always think that
you can take what's not yours.

19:33.999 --> 19:37.999
This is just your story
going through life.

19:37.999 --> 19:38.999
You feel you can sleep
with somebody

19:39.000 --> 19:40.999
even if it's your
best friend's girlfriend.

19:40.999 --> 19:42.999
You feel that you
can walk into a shop

19:42.999 --> 19:44.999
and you can take something
without paying for it.

19:44.999 --> 19:46.999
I mean, do you feel that you
can just take something from me,

19:46.999 --> 19:47.999
and why am I any different?

19:47.999 --> 19:48.999
I'm not.

19:48.999 --> 19:50.999
It's not about what he took.

19:50.999 --> 19:52.999
It's about
the principle of it,

19:52.999 --> 19:57.999
and I as a business owner
am very sensitive to that.

19:57.999 --> 19:59.999
How do I trust you?

20:00.999 --> 20:02.999
- I--
- I don't trust you.

20:02.999 --> 20:07.999
How can I trust you with money
that you're handling every day?

20:07.999 --> 20:10.999
- I screwed up,
and I screwed up big time.

20:10.999 --> 20:11.999
- Sure did.

20:11.999 --> 20:14.000
- I'm not a bad person.

20:16.999 --> 20:19.999
- If it walks like a duck,
it talks like a duck...

20:21.999 --> 20:23.999
- This is--
you have to understand,

20:23.999 --> 20:25.999
I'm--
it's utterly embarrassing.

20:25.999 --> 20:28.999
I'd almost rather
just be stuck back in jail

20:28.999 --> 20:30.999
than go through all this.

20:30.999 --> 20:33.999
- You have to make me
understand why I can justify

20:33.999 --> 20:36.999
keeping you in our employment.

20:36.999 --> 20:39.999
- I know I haven't been
the best employee in the world,

20:39.999 --> 20:42.999
but...it's more
than just a job.

20:42.999 --> 20:44.999
You know,
it's kind of like my home,

20:44.999 --> 20:46.999
and I don't have a lot
in this town.

20:46.999 --> 20:51.999
So just I hope--
I guess I just pray,

20:51.999 --> 20:54.999
because I don't really
have another choice--

20:54.999 --> 20:57.999
you'll let me try
to earn your trust back.

20:57.999 --> 21:00.999
- I don't know how
we go forward from this place,

21:00.999 --> 21:02.999
and I'm very honest with you.

21:02.999 --> 21:04.999
I don't care
whether you need the money.

21:04.999 --> 21:07.999
I am definitely suspending you
for a couple of weeks.

21:07.999 --> 21:09.999
- I'm 36 years old.

21:09.999 --> 21:12.999
To make a mistake like this,
there's just no word for it.

21:12.999 --> 21:13.999
I just have to remember
when I do things

21:13.999 --> 21:16.999
that it doesn't just affect me,
it affects other people.

21:16.999 --> 21:18.999
- Just go now.

21:19.999 --> 21:22.999
I'd think very carefully
about your future.

21:22.999 --> 21:23.999
That's what I would do.

21:23.999 --> 21:25.999
- ♪ Oh, hold on ♪

21:25.999 --> 21:26.999
♪ Ohh ♪

21:26.999 --> 21:28.999
♪ Oh, hold on ♪

21:28.999 --> 21:29.999
♪ Ohh ♪

21:29.999 --> 21:31.999
♪ Oh, hold on ♪

21:31.999 --> 21:33.999
♪ With stars in our eyes ♪

21:33.999 --> 21:36.999
♪ So let's paint the sky ♪

21:46.000 --> 21:48.999
- Tom, I've started
doing the paint.

21:48.999 --> 21:50.999
I have two of them
in here.

21:50.999 --> 21:51.999
- I have four more.

21:51.999 --> 21:53.999
Ooh, careful,
careful, careful.

21:53.999 --> 21:54.999
- I'm--oh.

21:54.999 --> 21:56.000
- Yeah.

21:56.999 --> 21:57.999
Oh, sh**.

21:57.999 --> 21:59.999
- Give me something
to put this--

21:59.999 --> 22:04.999
Tom's apartment previously
was a combination

22:04.999 --> 22:06.999
of fratty guy stuff

22:06.999 --> 22:09.999
mixed with, like,
whatever ex-girlfriend of his

22:09.999 --> 22:11.999
had thrown in there.

22:11.999 --> 22:14.999
- Yeah, screw this.
We can still use it.

22:16.999 --> 22:18.999
What's harder, painting the wall
or putting down the paper?

22:18.999 --> 22:21.999
I mean, the guy lived
in the apartment for ten years

22:21.999 --> 22:23.999
and still has vertical blinds.

22:23.999 --> 22:25.999
Bleh, gross.

22:25.999 --> 22:27.999
- It's Scheana and Shay's
one-year anniversary, isn't it?

22:27.999 --> 22:28.999
- Yeah.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.999
- Just sucks
because as much as--

22:30.999 --> 22:32.999
I just want to be
happy for them today,

22:32.999 --> 22:35.999
but, like, I need a breather
from her.

22:35.999 --> 22:36.999
- Mm-hmm.

22:36.999 --> 22:38.999
Scheana and I
are tapping into

22:38.999 --> 22:40.999
a deeper issue
with our friendship.

22:40.999 --> 22:44.999
I believe that Scheana
has some resentment

22:44.999 --> 22:47.000
and a little jealousy
of Tom and I's relationship.

22:47.999 --> 22:48.999
Dude, I would like to
not be around any of them

22:48.999 --> 22:50.999
for, like, a hot sec.

22:50.999 --> 22:51.999
- Yeah.
- That'd be nice.

22:51.999 --> 22:53.999
She really has those feelings
of resentment

22:53.999 --> 22:57.999
because I spend more time
with Tom.

22:57.999 --> 23:01.999
I think there's just gonna be
a little less of Scheana and I.

23:01.999 --> 23:03.999
- I think I have a nice name
for my art piece.

23:03.999 --> 23:04.999
- What is it?

23:04.999 --> 23:07.999
- I call it
Overcoming the Obstacle.

23:18.999 --> 23:20.999
- I wonder why it's called
The Alley.

23:23.999 --> 23:25.999
- Hey, Kristen.
- Hi.

23:25.999 --> 23:27.999
- Can I get you guys
something to drink?

23:27.999 --> 23:28.999
- Yes.
- You guys want a shot?

23:28.999 --> 23:30.999
Do we need a shot?
- Yeah.

23:30.999 --> 23:31.999
- Can you make a good
Moscow Mule?

23:31.999 --> 23:33.000
- Ooh, I want
one of those too, please.

23:33.999 --> 23:35.999
- I'll have one too.
- All right. Cool, guys.

23:35.999 --> 23:36.999
- I'm not driving.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.999
If you're suspended
for two weeks,

23:38.999 --> 23:39.999
you're on vacation.

23:39.999 --> 23:41.999
f*** it, we're gonna go
and have some fun.

23:41.999 --> 23:42.999
Let's do a shot.
- Thank you.

23:42.999 --> 23:44.999
- Let's congratulate me
getting suspended from Sur.

23:44.999 --> 23:45.999
- Cheers, whoo!
- Wait, what?

23:45.999 --> 23:46.999
- So by the way, you're
gonna be picking up the tab,

23:46.999 --> 23:48.999
'cause I'm broke.

23:48.999 --> 23:49.999
- Wait, what the f***?
Hold on.

23:49.999 --> 23:51.999
- I got suspended from work
for two weeks,

23:51.999 --> 23:53.999
which is better
than being fired,

23:53.999 --> 23:55.999
but in hindsight...

23:55.999 --> 23:57.999
- I'm working. Yeah.
- She has a job, so...

23:57.999 --> 23:59.999
- That's not hindsight.

23:59.999 --> 24:02.999
- It's not?
Is Kevin coming here?

24:02.999 --> 24:04.999
- Blessing in disguise.
Maybe he just won't come.

24:04.999 --> 24:06.999
- Okay, Kristen,
you were loving him.

24:06.999 --> 24:07.999
- Liking.

24:07.999 --> 24:08.999
- Okay, but you guys were
having a good time.

24:08.999 --> 24:09.999
- Thought he was hot.

24:09.999 --> 24:12.999
Made out, had a blast,
hooked up.

24:12.999 --> 24:13.999
Everything was awesome.

24:13.999 --> 24:14.999
- Okay, when you say
"hooked up," you had sex?

24:15.000 --> 24:16.999
- Yes, we had sex.

24:16.999 --> 24:18.999
- Okay, he has a girlfriend.
So I'm not gonna--

24:19.000 --> 24:20.999
- He has a girlfriend now?

24:20.999 --> 24:22.999
- Don't get mad
at what I'm gonna say.

24:22.999 --> 24:23.999
This is what I think.
Don't get mad about this.

24:23.999 --> 24:26.999
We thought you knew.
- Then he f***ing lied to me.

24:26.999 --> 24:29.999
I would have never in
a million motherf***ing years

24:29.999 --> 24:31.000
even considered kissing him

24:31.999 --> 24:34.999
if I knew that he was
doing that to someone.

24:34.999 --> 24:35.999
Don't look at me like that.

24:35.999 --> 24:36.999
- When Kristen loves
a relationship,

24:36.999 --> 24:38.999
she will stick with some guy

24:38.999 --> 24:40.999
years beyond
its expiration date.

24:40.999 --> 24:42.999
I've never seen Kristen
get sick of a guy.

24:42.999 --> 24:44.999
- Dun-dun-dun!

24:44.999 --> 24:46.999
- Hey.

24:46.999 --> 24:49.999
- Kristen tried to play
the whole "I didn't know,"

24:49.999 --> 24:51.999
because she didn't want
to upset Stassi,

24:51.999 --> 24:52.999
and she didn't want
Stassi to think

24:52.999 --> 24:54.999
that she was still
a "homewrecker."

24:54.999 --> 24:56.000
- Hi!
- Hey.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.999
- Can I ask you a question?

24:58.999 --> 25:00.999
Do you have a girlfriend?

25:03.999 --> 25:04.999
- No, no!

25:04.999 --> 25:06.999
- Did you, though,
in the beginning?

25:06.999 --> 25:08.999
- But you did know--
- Yes, he--

25:08.999 --> 25:10.999
Saturday he cheated
on his f***ing girlfriend.

25:10.999 --> 25:11.999
- I already told you--
- Sunday--

25:11.999 --> 25:13.999
- I already told you
that we were--

25:13.999 --> 25:17.999
I--we still had
our places.

25:17.999 --> 25:18.999
We were rekindling things.

25:18.999 --> 25:21.999
- Did she think you were
her boyfriend, Kevin?

25:21.999 --> 25:22.999
- It wasn't official,

25:22.999 --> 25:24.999
but, yes, we've been
hanging out a lot, yes.

25:26.999 --> 25:28.999
- You are worse
than Jax has ever been,

25:28.999 --> 25:29.999
and it is really unfair...

25:29.999 --> 25:31.999
- Why am I such a douche?

25:31.999 --> 25:32.999
- For you
to treat her like that

25:32.999 --> 25:33.999
and to bring me into it.

25:33.999 --> 25:34.999
- All I can say
is I'm sorry and--

25:34.999 --> 25:36.999
- I won't lose sleep over it.

25:36.999 --> 25:38.999
I could care f***ing less,
honestly.

25:38.999 --> 25:39.999
- I never said you were.
That's fine, I don't think--

25:39.999 --> 25:41.999
- Literally, like, we banged,
we made out a few times.

25:41.999 --> 25:42.999
I thought you were cool.
I was wrong.

25:42.999 --> 25:45.999
Bad judgment.
Lesson learned.

25:45.999 --> 25:46.999
Go away.

25:49.999 --> 25:52.999
- I just want to say that
I am sorry for everything,

25:52.999 --> 25:54.999
and I don't--you don't ever
have to forgive me.

25:54.999 --> 25:57.999
I understand it
if you won't.

25:57.999 --> 25:58.999
- Here, I'll walk you out.
- So...

25:58.999 --> 25:59.999
- I'll walk you out.

25:59.999 --> 26:00.999
- I'm--last time,
I'm sorry.

26:00.999 --> 26:02.999
- So say good-bye to Kevin.
- Bye.

26:02.999 --> 26:04.999
- Is it too much
to ask for

26:04.999 --> 26:06.999
to find an awesome guy,

26:06.999 --> 26:09.999
an awesome job.
who's, like, sweet

26:09.999 --> 26:11.999
and genuine and charming?

26:11.999 --> 26:13.999
I'm 5'9"
and f***ing beautiful.

26:13.999 --> 26:15.999
I can't believe this sh**.

26:15.999 --> 26:17.999
Bye, bitch, bye.

26:20.999 --> 26:21.999
- I need to get the back shot.

26:21.999 --> 26:23.999
No, no, back up like you're--
Like--like right there.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.999
- Does my butt look good?
Grab it.

26:44.999 --> 26:47.999
♪ Taking a leap of faith ♪

26:52.999 --> 26:53.999
- Up.

26:53.999 --> 26:54.999
- No.

26:54.999 --> 26:55.999
It's, like, 11:00.

26:55.999 --> 26:57.999
I just saw that apartment.

26:57.999 --> 26:59.999
It's so nice.
Like, it looks like a hotel.

26:59.999 --> 27:01.999
But it was
the size of this room,

27:01.999 --> 27:04.999
and literally, like,
where do I put my shoes?

27:04.999 --> 27:05.999
- I need coffee.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.999
- I'm, like, cursed
when it comes to apartments.

27:08.999 --> 27:09.999
When Jax and I
were living together,

27:09.999 --> 27:12.999
he did some damage
and my name was on the lease.

27:12.999 --> 27:13.999
So that affected my credit.

27:13.999 --> 27:15.999
Every time I feel like
I'm hitting rock bottom,

27:15.999 --> 27:18.999
like, something else
just happens.

27:18.999 --> 27:20.999
It's like, no,
sh** can always get worse.

27:20.999 --> 27:24.999
And I'm staying with someone
who f***ed my ex-boyfriend.

27:24.999 --> 27:25.999
Twice.

27:25.999 --> 27:28.000
So where does one
go from here?

27:28.999 --> 27:30.999
- I was meeting
Jax and Brittany for drinks.

27:30.999 --> 27:32.999
- Wait, was Kevin there?

27:32.999 --> 27:33.999
- Oh, yeah.

27:33.999 --> 27:35.999
- How did that
conversation go?

27:35.999 --> 27:38.000
- Told him that he was
a douche and a liar

27:38.999 --> 27:40.999
and that he can crawl back
to his ex-girlfriend,

27:40.999 --> 27:41.999
and I hope she doesn't
take him back.

27:41.999 --> 27:42.999
I'm almost, like, glad

27:42.999 --> 27:44.999
that he ended up
being such a bad person,

27:44.999 --> 27:46.999
'cause it was so much easier
to kick him out of my apartment.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.999
This is a total
squatter trade-up.

27:48.999 --> 27:50.999
Out with Kevin
and in with Stassi.

27:50.999 --> 27:52.999
- So Saturday,
I am going to go see Lisa.

27:52.999 --> 27:55.999
- That's gonna suck.
- It is so gonna suck!

27:55.999 --> 27:56.999
- Katie is, like, nothing

27:56.999 --> 27:58.999
in comparison to how,
like--

27:58.999 --> 28:01.999
- Yeah, honestly, it's just
I've been so, like, fed up

28:01.999 --> 28:02.999
with this whole
sex tape thing.

28:02.999 --> 28:04.999
A year and a half ago,

28:04.999 --> 28:06.999
the day that I moved
to New York

28:06.999 --> 28:07.999
to be with Patrick,

28:08.000 --> 28:11.999
I'm just told
my ex-boyfriend, not Jax,

28:11.999 --> 28:16.999
is trying to sell
a tape of me

28:16.999 --> 28:17.999
doing the M word.

28:17.999 --> 28:19.999
- What a dick.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.999
- I technically
got laid last night.

28:21.999 --> 28:23.999
I masturbated via FaceTime.

28:23.999 --> 28:26.999
I've never done that before.
You can do it.

28:26.999 --> 28:29.999
I'd never done it before, and
then finally I was just like,

28:29.999 --> 28:31.999
okay, I'm just gonna
muster the strength,

28:31.999 --> 28:33.000
and we're like--
I'm just gonna do it.

28:33.999 --> 28:34.999
- Really?

28:34.999 --> 28:35.999
- But not your face,
just your vajay?

28:35.999 --> 28:36.999
- No, 'cause he wanted
to see my face.

28:36.999 --> 28:37.999
- Yeah, of course.

28:37.999 --> 28:39.999
- Lisa was talking to him,
and Lisa's like,

28:39.999 --> 28:41.999
"He came in and said
he wants $900 for it."

28:41.999 --> 28:44.999
I'm like, "I'm not
giving him $900."

28:44.999 --> 28:45.999
And then Lisa calls me
and she's like,

28:45.999 --> 28:47.999
"I took care of it."

28:47.999 --> 28:48.999
And I'm like, "What?"

28:48.999 --> 28:50.999
She's like,
"We paid him $900 cash."

28:50.999 --> 28:51.999
And I'm like,
"So you gave him cash,

28:51.999 --> 28:53.999
so there's no record of it."

28:53.999 --> 28:54.999
- Oh, my God.

28:54.999 --> 28:56.999
- And you didn't make him
sign anything.

28:56.999 --> 28:57.999
I just feel like I need
to go and talk to her,

28:57.999 --> 29:00.999
and I just want to be like,
"Listen, thank you."

29:00.999 --> 29:02.000
- You don't want
to owe her anything.

29:02.999 --> 29:04.000
- "Thank you for the 9--Thank
you for doing that for me."

29:04.999 --> 29:05.999
- Yeah.

29:05.999 --> 29:07.999
- Bottom line, if I'm trying to
make things right with people,

29:07.999 --> 29:09.999
Lisa's the first stop
on that tour,

29:09.999 --> 29:11.999
and I gotta kiss that ring.

29:11.999 --> 29:13.999
I will never win, and it
only makes my life harder...

29:13.999 --> 29:16.999
- Yep.
- To be fighting with her.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.999
- I'm looking at event spaces
for an engagement party.

29:28.999 --> 29:30.999
We could have a party
on a boat.

29:30.999 --> 29:31.999
That would be really cool.

29:31.999 --> 29:32.999
- I would love that.

29:32.999 --> 29:34.999
- I like unique sh**
like this.

29:34.999 --> 29:35.999
- It's an idea.

29:35.999 --> 29:37.999
- Once we go to
wedding locations...

29:37.999 --> 29:40.999
- Bubby, let's not get
ahead of ourselves now.

29:40.999 --> 29:41.999
You're giving me anxiety
over here.

29:41.999 --> 29:43.999
- Hello.

29:43.999 --> 29:44.999
- Hello.

29:44.999 --> 29:45.999
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:45.999 --> 29:47.999
- Bitch, you better
have my money.

29:49.999 --> 29:51.999
- Did you bring
your checkbook?

29:51.999 --> 29:53.999
- Um, I actually did.

29:53.999 --> 29:55.999
- Come on, dude.
- What? No.

29:55.999 --> 29:57.999
- Just Venmo me.
- You gotta get Venmo.

29:57.999 --> 29:59.999
- No, I don't do
anything like that.

29:59.999 --> 30:00.999
- Do you do Uber though?

30:00.999 --> 30:02.999
- No, because people can
get your account numbers.

30:02.999 --> 30:05.999
- Yeah, but, Jax, you leave your
debit card everywhere you go.

30:05.999 --> 30:06.999
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- That's true, that's true.

30:06.999 --> 30:09.999
- And your phone unlocked
with your dick pics.

30:11.999 --> 30:12.999
- I noticed that Jax
never said thank you

30:12.999 --> 30:14.999
about me bailing him
out of jail.

30:14.999 --> 30:16.999
- All right,
I'm sending the money over.

30:16.999 --> 30:18.999
- But if I had to choose between
a thank you and the money,

30:18.999 --> 30:19.999
I'm gonna choose the money.

30:19.999 --> 30:21.999
- Welcome to the future, Daddy.
- Welcome to the future, man.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.999
- Did you guys have
a good time in Hawaii,

30:23.999 --> 30:24.999
other than my little fiasco?

30:24.999 --> 30:26.999
- Forget about it.
- Yeah, no, it was amazing.

30:26.999 --> 30:28.999
- It was the best sh** ever.
- Did you have a good time?

30:28.999 --> 30:29.999
- No--okay--
- We had every intention--

30:29.999 --> 30:31.999
- Did you "consummate"?

30:31.999 --> 30:32.999
- There was 14 people with us.

30:32.999 --> 30:34.999
Every time we turned around,
there was a knock on the door.

30:34.999 --> 30:36.999
He was downstairs
or I was downstairs

30:36.999 --> 30:38.999
or upst--like,
we were all over the place.

30:38.999 --> 30:41.999
- It's day 17, and my penis
has remained flaccid.

30:41.999 --> 30:43.999
We got to spice it up.

30:43.999 --> 30:45.999
It's kinda starting to be
a big deal, you know?

30:45.999 --> 30:48.999
People are asking me, and it's
sort of turning into this thing.

30:48.999 --> 30:50.999
- You wanna know what
popped on my phone yesterday?

30:50.999 --> 30:55.999
Another text message
from Stassi Schroeder.

30:55.999 --> 30:56.999
- Did you respond?
- Did you respond?

30:56.999 --> 30:58.999
- I didn't respond.
No, she wrote me off,

30:58.999 --> 31:01.999
and was just, like,
"Hey, let's talk."

31:01.999 --> 31:02.999
- I'm not saying
it's the reason,

31:02.999 --> 31:04.999
but ever since Stassi's
been out of Katie's life,

31:04.999 --> 31:06.999
I think I've liked Katie
a lot more.

31:06.999 --> 31:08.999
- Kristen and I
are finally just, like,

31:08.999 --> 31:09.999
getting back
to being friends

31:09.999 --> 31:12.999
and it not being, like,
weird or strained

31:12.999 --> 31:14.999
or awkward or
there's no tension,

31:14.999 --> 31:18.999
and this is not going
to help our friendship, so...

31:18.999 --> 31:19.999
- Dude, it came through.
- Wow, it worked?

31:19.999 --> 31:21.999
- Wait, hold on a sec.
- This could be dangerous,

31:21.999 --> 31:23.999
'cause now no one can be like,
"Yo, you owe me money."

31:23.999 --> 31:25.999
- I hope you learned
a lesson, man.

31:25.999 --> 31:26.999
- I know.
Well, since I have no money,

31:26.999 --> 31:28.999
and I have nowhere to be,
no job.

31:28.999 --> 31:31.000
I'm gonna go hang out
at Brittany's work.

31:31.999 --> 31:32.999
I might have
to steal some beers

31:32.999 --> 31:33.999
because I can't afford
anything else.

31:33.999 --> 31:35.000
- You bring your own beers
into Hooters.

31:35.999 --> 31:36.999
- He's gonna dine and ditch
his own girlfriend.

31:36.999 --> 31:38.999
- Dine and ditch
his own girlfriend.

31:38.999 --> 31:40.999
- Oh, my God, don't say that.
- That sh**'s hilarious.

31:40.999 --> 31:41.999
- Stick her with the bill.

31:41.999 --> 31:43.999
All right,
we'll talk to you soon.

31:43.999 --> 31:44.999
- All right, bye.
- All right, man.

31:44.999 --> 31:45.999
- Oh, he's so cute.

31:45.999 --> 31:47.999
- I'm gonna take this off.
He's hot.

31:47.999 --> 31:49.999
- I'm gonna go ahead
and take this off.

31:49.999 --> 31:51.999
- Ooh.

31:51.999 --> 31:52.999
- Just kidding.
So not gonna happen.

31:52.999 --> 31:53.999
- That was so not you.

31:53.999 --> 31:55.999
- I know.
- I liked it.

31:55.999 --> 31:58.999
Are you really
gonna take it off?

31:58.999 --> 31:59.999
Bubby?

31:59.999 --> 32:01.999
- ♪ No matter what ♪

32:01.999 --> 32:05.999
♪ We've gotta
keep moving on ♪

32:11.999 --> 32:12.999
- Welcome to Ocean Prime.
- Thank you.

32:12.999 --> 32:13.999
- Have you dined
with us before?

32:13.999 --> 32:14.999
- No.
- No, first time.

32:14.999 --> 32:16.999
- Okay.
- It's our anniversary.

32:16.999 --> 32:18.999
- Oh, happy anniversary.
- Thank you.

32:18.999 --> 32:21.999
- Very nice. All right, let's
go ahead and get you seated.

32:21.999 --> 32:22.999
- A couple months ago,

32:22.999 --> 32:24.999
I didn't know if we were
gonna make it to a year mark.

32:24.999 --> 32:28.999
I have been so miserable
and lonely this past week.

32:28.999 --> 32:30.999
Like, thank God I have
the most amazing friends.

32:30.999 --> 32:32.999
- I've been so miserable
and lonely for two years.

32:32.999 --> 32:34.999
- Why did you marry me?
Why?

32:34.999 --> 32:36.999
- Come on, Scheana.
- Do you regret marrying me?

32:36.999 --> 32:39.999
I thought Shay and I had
the strongest marriage ever.

32:39.999 --> 32:41.999
Then I found out
we needed to get stronger,

32:41.999 --> 32:43.999
and I think
we're on that path.

32:43.999 --> 32:45.999
I think I'm gonna
just try one of each

32:45.999 --> 32:47.000
of the Prime cocktails.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
- Yeah, I'm down.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
- Berries & Bubbles
maybe first.

32:50.999 --> 32:52.999
But it's like then I want
a cucumber gimlet.

32:52.999 --> 32:53.999
Then I want a Prime Margarita.
- That's what I want to get.

32:53.999 --> 32:56.999
Yeah, that sounds good.
- Then I want a Black Orchid.

32:56.999 --> 32:58.000
- Damn, they got
everything here.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.999
- On nights like this,

32:59.999 --> 33:00.999
let's f***ing go all-out.

33:00.999 --> 33:03.999
It's me and you, baby,
you know?

33:03.999 --> 33:04.999
I feel contradicting sometimes

33:04.999 --> 33:07.999
when I'm telling Shay,
you know, "Don't drink so much,"

33:07.999 --> 33:08.999
and then I'm like,
"Drink some more, honey."

33:08.999 --> 33:10.999
- Oh, wow.
- Pardon my interruption.

33:10.999 --> 33:12.000
How are you doing tonight?
- Good. How are you?

33:12.999 --> 33:13.999
- This is a special occasion.

33:13.999 --> 33:14.999
It's our one-year anniversary,

33:15.000 --> 33:17.999
so it's probably time
to celebrate with a cocktail.

33:17.999 --> 33:18.999
Or ten.

33:18.999 --> 33:20.999
- Do we want our cocktails
sooner than later?

33:20.999 --> 33:22.999
- Yeah.
- I can make that happen.

33:22.999 --> 33:23.999
- Thank you.

33:23.999 --> 33:25.999
- Well, should we--
wanna toast?

33:25.999 --> 33:28.999
This year has been
a roller coaster

33:28.999 --> 33:31.999
for both of us,
especially me.

33:31.999 --> 33:34.999
But, uh, I know I made
the best decision

33:34.999 --> 33:36.999
of my entire life
marrying you.

33:36.999 --> 33:37.999
I love you.

33:37.999 --> 33:40.999
- I love you.

33:40.999 --> 33:42.999
- It's still frustrating

33:42.999 --> 33:43.999
having her count my drinks

33:43.999 --> 33:45.999
or tell me when I can
this and that,

33:45.999 --> 33:50.999
but at the same time
I married a hot, awesome person.

33:50.999 --> 33:54.999
It's--it's not worth it
to fight over.

33:54.999 --> 33:55.999
- You're not an alcoholic,

33:55.999 --> 33:58.999
and I don't ever want you to
think I think of you that way.

33:58.999 --> 34:00.999
You're not hiding bottles
in your backpack.

34:00.999 --> 34:02.999
You're not waking up
at 6:00 a.m.

34:02.999 --> 34:04.999
and taking a shot of tequila
and coming back to bed, like--

34:04.999 --> 34:05.999
- Yeah.

34:05.999 --> 34:08.999
- It's never been the drinking
that's so bad

34:08.999 --> 34:10.999
that it's like, "Oh, my God,
you need to go to rehab.

34:10.999 --> 34:11.999
You're an alcoholic."

34:11.999 --> 34:12.999
- Drink your champagne.

34:12.999 --> 34:14.999
- The key for Shay
is not to stay at home,

34:14.999 --> 34:18.999
be a shut-in sober person
who never has any fun.

34:18.999 --> 34:20.999
It's just he needs to find
that happy medium.

34:20.999 --> 34:23.999
Don't get sh**-faced.
Don't be a bore.

34:23.999 --> 34:24.999
Let's do the gimlet one next.

34:24.999 --> 34:26.999
- Do you wanna do, like,
the Prime Margarita?

34:26.999 --> 34:27.999
- Yeah.
- One of each, yeah.

34:27.999 --> 34:30.999
- Yeah.
- Coming up...

34:30.999 --> 34:32.999
- Hi, Lisa.

34:47.999 --> 34:49.999
- There he is.
- How are you, mate?

34:49.999 --> 34:50.999
- What's going on?
- Good to see you guys.

34:50.999 --> 34:52.999
Good to see you guys.

34:52.999 --> 34:54.999
- What's up?
- What's up, man? Long time.

34:54.999 --> 34:55.999
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah, nice to see you.

34:55.999 --> 34:57.999
- Obviously, I don't know
how much you know

34:57.999 --> 34:58.999
about what we're doing here.
- Fill me in.

34:58.999 --> 34:59.999
- So my brother and I
started a company.

34:59.999 --> 35:01.999
It's called Related Garments.

35:01.999 --> 35:03.999
Most guys don't match their
socks and their underwear.

35:03.999 --> 35:05.999
- Well, they should.
- They should, exactly.

35:05.999 --> 35:06.999
- It's a turn-on.
- You just feel fresh as f***.

35:06.999 --> 35:08.999
You know, I've done
a lot of modeling in my life,

35:08.999 --> 35:09.999
so I know obviously
how to do it.

35:09.999 --> 35:11.999
Let me see your butt.

35:11.999 --> 35:13.999
Gorgeous, doll.
Big handful.

35:13.999 --> 35:15.999
I'm gonna say yes to pretty
much every opportunity I get

35:15.999 --> 35:16.999
to grab Lala's ass.

35:18.999 --> 35:19.999
- Yeah, like that.

35:19.999 --> 35:20.999
Okay, you may need
to get the back shot.

35:20.999 --> 35:22.999
No, no, back up like you're--
Like--like right there.

35:22.999 --> 35:25.999
Perfect.
Perfect.

35:25.999 --> 35:26.999
Your other leg out
right there.

35:26.999 --> 35:28.999
Perfect, like that.

35:28.999 --> 35:30.999
- Modeling keeps me
really busy.

35:30.999 --> 35:32.999
I do a lot of lingerie,
a lot of swimwear.

35:32.999 --> 35:34.999
Does my butt look good?
Grab it.

35:34.999 --> 35:37.999
Clothing, not so much,
just because of my body type,

35:37.999 --> 35:38.999
unless it's Spandex.

35:38.999 --> 35:40.999
I'm really good
at modeling Spandex.

35:40.999 --> 35:41.999
- That's a wrap.
Thank you so much.

35:41.999 --> 35:43.999
- Good, I think we gotta
do one more, guys.

35:43.999 --> 35:44.999
I think we gotta do
a couple more.

35:46.999 --> 35:47.999
- Get him,
get him right here.

35:47.999 --> 35:48.999
Get him, get him,
get him, get him.

35:48.999 --> 35:52.999
- I think that if you look
at just our chemistry,

35:52.999 --> 35:55.999
I feel like we have a connection
that's just, like...

35:55.999 --> 35:56.999
undeniable.

35:56.999 --> 35:58.999
I've been having
so much fun with you,

35:58.999 --> 36:00.000
and you know that I love you
just as a mate,

36:00.999 --> 36:03.999
and, you know, but I like
making out with you too.

36:03.999 --> 36:05.999
So I just feel like
we're just, like--what are we?

36:05.999 --> 36:07.999
We're just friends
that we're just making out.

36:07.999 --> 36:08.999
- We're friends that make out,
yeah.

36:08.999 --> 36:10.999
And you can have anybody
touch your peep.

36:10.999 --> 36:12.999
You can never get mad
if anything happens,

36:12.999 --> 36:13.999
because I've laid it out.

36:13.999 --> 36:15.999
I need a little bit
of attention,

36:15.999 --> 36:16.999
and if James can provide that

36:16.999 --> 36:19.999
and be okay with the
guidelines that I've laid down,

36:19.999 --> 36:20.999
I think we're gonna be okay.

36:20.999 --> 36:22.999
No sleeping together.
- All right, fine.

36:22.999 --> 36:24.999
- Yeah?
- I mean, never, ever?

36:24.999 --> 36:26.999
- Well, I mean, I don't
intend to sleep with you.

36:26.999 --> 36:28.999
- Okay, yeah, I don't intend
to sleep with you either, fine.

36:28.999 --> 36:30.999
From the start of
Lala and I's relationship,

36:30.999 --> 36:32.999
it's been all about rules
and regulations.

36:32.999 --> 36:34.999
If we're, like, drunk one night,
it could happen.

36:34.999 --> 36:36.999
I'm just gonna keep, like,
breaking the rules

36:36.999 --> 36:38.999
and just hope I get into
her pants at some point.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
Thank you for clarifying.

36:40.999 --> 36:41.999
- You're welcome.

36:49.999 --> 36:51.999
- How many reservations
do we have tonight?

36:51.999 --> 36:53.999
142?
- Yeah.

36:53.999 --> 36:54.999
- Have you got
the tip book here?

36:54.999 --> 36:56.999
I just want to have
a quick look

36:56.999 --> 36:57.999
at who's doing what.

36:57.999 --> 36:59.999
Who's doing really well?

36:59.999 --> 37:03.999
- Well, Scheana and Katie
are doing pretty good.

37:07.999 --> 37:10.999
- My strategy is to
go into the restaurant

37:10.999 --> 37:12.999
before it opens
when I know Lisa's there...

37:12.999 --> 37:14.999
It's about time.
I'm nervous right now.

37:14.999 --> 37:17.999
And have an impromptu
conversation

37:17.999 --> 37:20.999
because I don't
want her planning

37:20.999 --> 37:21.999
tons of stuff to say to me.

37:21.999 --> 37:24.999
Why didn't I have a bottle
of wine before I did this?

37:24.999 --> 37:26.999
- I wouldn't order wine
with her though.

37:26.999 --> 37:27.999
- What if she
offers it to me?

37:27.999 --> 37:28.999
- Ask for a tea.

37:28.999 --> 37:30.000
No.

37:30.999 --> 37:31.999
- What? Why?

37:31.999 --> 37:32.999
It just, like,
kinda shows you,

37:32.999 --> 37:34.999
like, you've grown
as a person.

37:34.999 --> 37:35.999
- But I haven't grown
in that way.

37:35.999 --> 37:36.999
- In front of her,
you have.

37:36.999 --> 37:38.999
- Is it just Lisa in there
or is there anybody else there?

37:38.999 --> 37:39.999
- Just Lisa.

37:39.999 --> 37:41.999
You're gonna be fine.
Deep breaths.

37:41.999 --> 37:43.999
- And I feel like green is,
like, an apologetic color, so...

37:43.999 --> 37:45.999
- Good luck.
- All right, thank you.

37:45.999 --> 37:46.999
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

38:00.999 --> 38:01.999
Hi, Lisa.

38:06.999 --> 38:09.999
I know I'm the last person
that you want to see, and--

38:10.000 --> 38:12.999
- This old woman's kind of busy,
if you know what I mean.

38:12.999 --> 38:15.999
I think that was the last thing
you called me publicly, Stassi.

38:15.999 --> 38:17.999
I don't really have
any interest

38:17.999 --> 38:19.999
in anything you have to say,
to be honest.

38:19.999 --> 38:20.999
I'd heard a lot
of negative things

38:21.000 --> 38:22.999
that Stassi Schroeder
had said about me.

38:22.999 --> 38:24.999
She called me an old woman

38:24.999 --> 38:27.999
and my staff
a bunch of drug addicts.

38:27.999 --> 38:30.999
- I understand that,
but I'd like the opportunity--

38:30.999 --> 38:32.999
- Oh, sit down.
What do you want?

38:32.999 --> 38:36.999
Say what you want about me.
I don't care anymore.

38:36.999 --> 38:39.999
But don't dis my staff
and my restaurant

38:39.999 --> 38:40.999
and my business.

38:40.999 --> 38:42.999
Oh, no, no, no, no.

38:42.999 --> 38:44.999
Where do you want
to start?

38:44.999 --> 38:49.999
- Well, I was just
completely disrespectful

38:49.999 --> 38:53.999
on, mm, many occasions
a lot of the time.

38:53.999 --> 38:54.999
- I'm glad you can
laugh about it.

38:54.999 --> 38:56.999
Now, it doesn't really
mean anything to me,

38:56.999 --> 38:58.999
but at the time,
it did hurt

38:58.999 --> 39:01.999
for you to be sitting there
bad-mouthing me,

39:01.999 --> 39:03.000
bad-mouthing the restaurant.

39:03.999 --> 39:05.999
You had a boss
and you had a good friend,

39:05.999 --> 39:07.999
and you f***ed it up,
you really did.

39:07.999 --> 39:11.999
When you were 22, you didn't
have a bloody pot to piss in,

39:11.999 --> 39:12.999
you know?

39:12.999 --> 39:13.999
And you came in here,

39:13.999 --> 39:17.999
and I really
had your back.

39:17.999 --> 39:19.999
I wish I hadn't,
to be honest.

39:19.999 --> 39:22.999
- She gave me a job
as a waitress.

39:22.999 --> 39:25.999
Like, I've served
a few hundred crispy chickens

39:25.999 --> 39:27.999
in my time,
poured some wine.

39:27.999 --> 39:30.999
What do I owe you again?

39:30.999 --> 39:31.999
- And you were calling me
an old woman.

39:31.999 --> 39:33.999
Yeah, you're right, I'm halfway
through my life, Stassi.

39:33.999 --> 39:36.999
And you know what?
I'm proud of my life.

39:36.999 --> 39:38.999
- I'm very, very sorry.

39:38.999 --> 39:39.999
- They're hollow words.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.999
- I want to say thank you
for everything with the sex--

39:43.999 --> 39:45.999
I hate saying this word--
sex tape.

39:45.999 --> 39:47.999
- I was the one that met
with the sleazy guy

39:47.999 --> 39:50.999
that I told you was sleazy
all the way along,

39:50.999 --> 39:51.999
and that's
why I fired him.

39:51.999 --> 39:53.000
And you were
in love with him.

39:53.999 --> 39:55.000
I went there
and I gave him cash

39:55.999 --> 39:56.999
to save your ass,

39:56.999 --> 39:58.999
and then you were
dismissive of me.

39:58.999 --> 40:00.999
The way you treated me.

40:00.999 --> 40:02.999
- All I can do is--
is try and apologize,

40:02.999 --> 40:05.999
and it--
and I'm--I'm doing my best,

40:05.999 --> 40:07.999
and you don't have
to accept it,

40:07.999 --> 40:08.999
but I wanted
to pay you back,

40:08.999 --> 40:09.999
and so I brought--
I brought money to give you.

40:09.999 --> 40:11.999
- I don't want the money.
- I need you to take it.

40:11.999 --> 40:12.999
- I don't want the money.
- This is really hard.

40:12.999 --> 40:14.999
I'm really doing
my best right now.

40:14.999 --> 40:16.999
- Good, I'm glad it's hard.
- I'm doing my best.

40:16.999 --> 40:18.999
I really am trying
to do my best right now.

40:18.999 --> 40:19.999
I'm sorry
that I've hurt everyone.

40:19.999 --> 40:21.999
- I don't want your money.
It's an insult.

40:21.999 --> 40:23.999
- You know what, I was just
coming to apologize, so...

40:23.999 --> 40:26.999
- Oh, you can stay there.
We've got more to talk about.

40:26.999 --> 40:27.999
- What more to--
You hate me, Lisa.

40:27.999 --> 40:29.999
You hate me.

40:29.999 --> 40:30.999
- You know what, you're not
important enough to hate.

40:30.999 --> 40:31.999
Sit down.

40:38.999 --> 40:40.999
- That is so mean.

40:40.999 --> 40:42.999
- You're not important enough
in my life for me to have--

40:42.999 --> 40:43.999
- But you're
making it very clear

40:43.999 --> 40:45.999
that you don't want
to see me right now.

40:45.999 --> 40:46.999
So, like, why--

40:46.999 --> 40:48.999
- I want to know
what you want.

40:53.999 --> 40:56.999
I promised myself
I wasn't gonna cry,

40:56.999 --> 40:58.999
but, like, Jesus.

40:58.999 --> 41:00.999
Lisa is really digging in

41:00.999 --> 41:03.999
and is making me feel bad

41:03.999 --> 41:05.999
about pretty much every decision
I've ever made in my life.

41:05.999 --> 41:08.999
It really is really hard
to swallow my pride right now.

41:08.999 --> 41:10.000
It is really
f***ing difficult.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.999
- I'm sure you're sorry,

41:11.999 --> 41:14.000
because it suits you now
to be sorry.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.999
- I just want to make
things right with people

41:15.999 --> 41:18.999
that I actually
do care about.

41:20.999 --> 41:23.999
- And that's why you're here?

41:23.999 --> 41:26.999
Stassi knows that if she
wants to get back

41:26.999 --> 41:27.999
with this group,

41:27.999 --> 41:30.000
she has to come
and confront me.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
It makes me wonder how sincere
this apology is.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.999
You've got to repair
your own fences

41:34.999 --> 41:36.999
and build your own bridges
again.

41:36.999 --> 41:38.999
I don't know
that all your friends

41:38.999 --> 41:40.999
will welcome you back
with open arms.

41:44.999 --> 41:46.999
- Because they were hurt.

41:46.999 --> 41:48.999
- Because, like, they've
all forgiven each other

41:48.999 --> 41:50.999
for doing really sh***y things,

41:50.999 --> 41:53.999
I--I felt like why can't
Katie forgive me?

41:53.999 --> 41:55.999
- Because they're
young and stupid.

41:55.999 --> 41:57.999
How did you feel
when she was engaged?

41:57.999 --> 41:58.999
- It was--

41:58.999 --> 42:00.000
- You know who
Schwartzie came to

42:00.999 --> 42:01.999
to ask about the ring?

42:01.999 --> 42:03.999
He came to me.

42:03.999 --> 42:06.999
He should have
gone to you.

42:07.999 --> 42:09.999
- You gave up
a lot of great friends.

42:09.999 --> 42:11.999
- They're not people that
I want to hang out with.

42:11.999 --> 42:13.999
- Katie was your
best friend for years.

42:13.999 --> 42:14.999
- You're just gonna hear
whoever's willing to do

42:14.999 --> 42:16.999
what you want,
and it's not okay.

42:16.999 --> 42:18.999
That is what you do.

42:20.999 --> 42:22.999
- I don't know
how they'll react.

42:22.999 --> 42:24.999
You've been really stupid.

42:24.999 --> 42:26.999
- I'm just gonna prove it
to everyone,

42:26.999 --> 42:28.999
so that's all I can do.

42:28.999 --> 42:29.999
- Go on then.
Off you go.

42:29.999 --> 42:30.999
- Thank you.

42:30.999 --> 42:33.999
- This old woman
has to do some work.

42:33.999 --> 42:36.999
- ♪ This is not the end ♪

42:38.999 --> 42:40.999
♪ This is not the end ♪

42:40.999 --> 42:42.999
- Next time on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

42:42.999 --> 42:45.999
- I'm having a launch party
for my beauty blog.

42:45.999 --> 42:48.999
Unfortunately, I can't
extend the invitation.

42:48.999 --> 42:50.999
- So you're telling me I can't
go to your event, Katie?

42:50.999 --> 42:53.999
- The purpose of this launch
party is to gain exposure.

42:53.999 --> 42:54.999
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

42:54.999 --> 42:56.999
- You're disgusting.
You treat me like sh**.

42:56.999 --> 42:57.999
I don't even think of you.

42:57.999 --> 42:59.999
- Shut up.
I'm a f***ing man.

42:59.999 --> 43:01.999
- It's just another reminder

43:01.999 --> 43:03.000
that I'm missing out
on milestones.

43:03.999 --> 43:04.999
- Stassi came by.

43:04.999 --> 43:05.999
- I'm just like,
I'm sorry.

43:05.999 --> 43:06.999
This is your bed,
now you can lie in it.

43:06.999 --> 43:08.999
- When you severed ties
with Katie,

43:08.999 --> 43:10.999
it was so cold
and so rigid.

43:10.999 --> 43:13.999
You were a f***ing bitch.

43:13.999 --> 43:14.999
