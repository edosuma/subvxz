00:05.151 --> 00:07.285
Hey, you know what's great about you going off to college?

00:07.368 --> 00:08.515
My newfound independence?

00:08.672 --> 00:11.869
Oh, no. My new batch of youth-oriented catalogs.

00:11.939 --> 00:15.933
For example, where on Earth could I put this fabulous purple flowered rug?

00:16.046 --> 00:19.184
It's so young and cool but doesn't really go with my room, so...

00:19.281 --> 00:20.122
My room.

00:21.212 --> 00:24.125
The matching beanbag chair arrives next week.

00:24.202 --> 00:27.007
- I love it when you miss me. 
- Oh, it's not that I miss you.

00:27.084 --> 00:30.270
It's just since you've been gone, I finally realized how the living room stayed so clean.

00:31.620 --> 00:33.351
- What do you think? 
- It works.

00:33.465 --> 00:34.800
- Thank you. 
- You're welcome.

00:35.155 --> 00:37.382
So, Sookie sent marshmallow cookies,

00:37.505 --> 00:39.813
Luke sent muffins,

00:39.994 --> 00:43.356
and I got you a copy of the Stars Hollow Gazette.

00:43.485 --> 00:45.394
You don't have to bring that to me anymore. I subscribed.

00:45.593 --> 00:47.950
You subscribed to the Stars Hollow Gazette?

00:48.149 --> 00:51.487
The editor of the Stars Hollow Gazette does not subscribe to the Stars Hollow Gazette.

00:51.606 --> 00:53.094
I didn't want to get cut off from the town.

00:53.304 --> 00:54.473
That's very sweet of you.

00:54.871 --> 00:56.607
Hey, you wanna grab some coffee before I head back?

00:56.750 --> 00:57.698
- Can't. 
- Why?

00:57.912 --> 00:59.572
- It's shopping week. 
- Isn't it always?

00:59.782 --> 01:01.363
The first week of school is called shopping week.

01:01.496 --> 01:03.846
You get to try out as many classes as you want before you pick

01:03.910 --> 01:05.495
the ones you want to stick with for the semester.

01:05.721 --> 01:08.209
I picked over fifty classes I'm gonna try out,

01:08.378 --> 01:10.488
plus another ten I'm gonna squeeze in if I have the time.

01:10.871 --> 01:13.326
They all sound completely amazing. I stayed up all night

01:13.386 --> 01:15.336
reading the class subscriptions over and over.

01:15.715 --> 01:17.446
You do know that if you weren't so pretty,

01:17.533 --> 01:19.831
you would've gotten the crap kicked out of you every day of your life.

01:19.954 --> 01:20.722
Walk me out?

01:20.994 --> 01:22.120
Because you need the protection.

01:22.933 --> 01:25.218
- Hey, what time's your first class? 
- Oh, you know, soon.

01:26.705 --> 01:27.542
What?

01:27.660 --> 01:30.670
You're not gonna rush to your first class and get there like an hour early, are you?

01:30.834 --> 01:31.639
No.

01:31.956 --> 01:33.601
- You are. 
- I am not.

01:33.845 --> 01:36.731
When you started elementary school, you told me the teacher wanted to meet

01:36.785 --> 01:40.757
all the parents at 6:30, and when we got there, the school wasn't open yet.

01:40.860 --> 01:41.761
I did that once.

01:41.899 --> 01:44.224
No, you got away with it once. You tried it every year.

01:44.367 --> 01:45.304
I'm not gonna be early.

01:45.411 --> 01:47.623
You know, if you took all the time you wasted being early for things...

01:49.461 --> 01:50.102
What?

01:50.880 --> 01:51.592
My mother was here.

01:52.206 --> 01:52.816
What?

01:52.999 --> 01:54.797
My mother - she was here. I can feel it.

01:54.955 --> 01:55.979
Grandma hasn't been here.

01:56.506 --> 01:58.007
- Smell that? 
- Smell what?

01:58.269 --> 02:01.042
The room - it smells like guilt and Chanel No. 5.

02:01.212 --> 02:02.502
Mom, I'm telling you, you're wrong.

02:03.208 --> 02:04.730
- You put the coffee table like that? 
- No.

02:05.009 --> 02:07.761
I have three other roommates. One of them probably did it.

02:08.017 --> 02:08.852
Three roommates?

02:09.045 --> 02:11.484
- When'd the other one come? 
- Last night. Her name's Janet.

02:11.607 --> 02:12.190
What's she like?

02:12.640 --> 02:13.860
- She jogs. 
- Enough said.

02:13.961 --> 02:15.717
- Come on, let's go. 
- You seriously don't smell that?

02:15.835 --> 02:18.144
We can get one cup of coffee, and then I have to get to class.

02:18.232 --> 02:19.947
- I knew you were early. 
- I'm not that early.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.074

04:32.094 --> 04:33.520
Freshmen.

04:34.946 --> 04:36.518
- Sign and date. 
- Signing and dating.

04:36.904 --> 04:38.499
Oh, do you have your last check stub?

04:38.955 --> 04:41.894
Yeah. Here. Oh, remember that?

04:42.042 --> 04:43.057
- Income. 
- Yeah.

04:43.170 --> 04:47.920
Those were the days, huh? Okay, my hand is cramping, and I'm done signing now.

04:48.178 --> 04:49.852
Sookie, can you hand me that screwdriver?

04:50.097 --> 04:53.128
Oh, hey, tomorrow we have to meet with Ted Oldaman

04:53.185 --> 04:56.313
and get our liability insurance instated before we can break ground on the inn.

04:56.769 --> 04:58.161
And that reminds me...

04:58.427 --> 05:00.860
Tom sent over the initial proposal for the work.

05:01.070 --> 05:02.354
- How much? 
- I'll tell you later.

05:02.584 --> 05:03.988
- When? 
- After you blow.

05:04.152 --> 05:04.714
Come on.

05:04.925 --> 05:06.742
Once you have the baby, then you can have the cow.

05:07.121 --> 05:08.216
Okay, I think I got it.

05:08.549 --> 05:09.538
Is it really that much?

05:09.783 --> 05:10.993
Here. I'm going to the nursery.

05:12.231 --> 05:14.638
It's $20,000 more than we thought.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.773
$20,000? That sucks.

05:16.936 --> 05:19.286
- I got the chimney report back. 
- Oh, shoot.

05:19.881 --> 05:21.279
- Hello? Hello? 
- What is that?

05:21.503 --> 05:26.045
Jackson. He's trying to hook up the house's central sound system to the baby monitor.

05:26.143 --> 05:30.182
I am in the baby's room. I repeat, I am in the baby's room. Copy that.

05:30.290 --> 05:33.085
This is probably the cutest creepy thing he's done yet.

05:33.188 --> 05:35.901
Can anyone hear me? I repeat, can anyone hear me?

05:36.039 --> 05:38.164
- Yes, Jackson! 
- You're supposed to use the walkie-talkie.

05:39.148 --> 05:41.953
Roger, roger, Jackson. We're receiving some feedback.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.735
I repeat, we're receiving some feed-

05:44.119 --> 05:45.241
Hello? Sookie?

05:46.034 --> 05:49.597
- Jackson, I'm receiving feed... 
- Do you hear me? Sookie?

05:50.016 --> 05:52.393
Yes, I can hear you. I...

05:52.782 --> 05:54.948
Sookie, just tell me if you can hear me.

05:55.235 --> 05:56.929
Jackson, I can hear...

05:57.933 --> 05:59.721
I can hear you just fine!

05:59.873 --> 06:01.644
Oh yeah, this system's gonna work great.

06:01.757 --> 06:02.930
Why aren't you using the walkie-talkie?

06:03.360 --> 06:04.772
- It's not working. 
- Here.

06:06.991 --> 06:09.904
- Hey, you know, I had a thought. 
- Yes?

06:10.150 --> 06:11.595
Well, obviously,

06:12.539 --> 06:15.094
it's gonna take some time to get the inn up and running, right?

06:15.170 --> 06:15.836
Right.

06:16.042 --> 06:20.717
And until we do, we have absolutely no money coming in whatsoever.

06:20.861 --> 06:21.726
So it's a happy thought.

06:21.848 --> 06:23.492
What do you think about starting a catering company?

06:23.702 --> 06:25.566
- A catering company. 
- Yeah.

06:25.724 --> 06:28.695
You could plan the events, decorations, themes, and I can cook.

06:28.807 --> 06:31.194
And it wouldn't be for very long - just until the baby came.

06:31.290 --> 06:33.117
- Yes, but... 
- Okay, here.

06:34.407 --> 06:37.009
Sookie, I'm not really a party planner. I've never done that.

06:37.271 --> 06:40.869
What are you talking about? You put on all those beautiful weddings at the inn.

06:41.002 --> 06:44.274
And the conventions -- the men in the hats and the buttons.

06:44.408 --> 06:47.233
Yes, but I had a staff at the inn and I had resources.

06:47.464 --> 06:48.612
Oh, come on.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.536
It'll be so fun to work together again.

06:51.386 --> 06:54.018
- Just think about it. 
- Fine, I'll think about it.

06:54.146 --> 06:54.638
Good.

06:55.815 --> 06:57.797
How long do I have to think about it?

06:57.946 --> 06:59.005
- About a week. 
- Sookie.

06:59.168 --> 07:01.684
Helen Thompson's son, Aaron, is having a birthday party

07:01.780 --> 07:05.532
and she asked me to cater, and I suggested that you plan it.

07:05.641 --> 07:07.141
She thought it was a fabulous idea.

07:07.852 --> 07:11.012
So she offered us the job and I just took it. It's Thursday.

07:11.594 --> 07:15.711
She wanted to do it on Aaron's actual birthday and I thought that was so sweet.

07:15.840 --> 07:18.245
- Helen's like that, you know? 
- Yes, I know.

07:18.373 --> 07:21.145
I can call her right now and tell her no if that's what you want.

07:21.507 --> 07:23.457
I mean it, you say the word and it's off.

07:24.354 --> 07:27.247
Maybe we could just try this one just to see if you like it.

07:27.934 --> 07:28.511
Maybe.

07:29.438 --> 07:32.392
Okay, Sookie, can you hear me now? Hello?

07:32.735 --> 07:35.756
- Jackson, I can hear you. 
- Use the monitor!

07:36.083 --> 07:36.754
Sorry!

07:43.733 --> 07:46.257
- Russian economics sucks. 
- I will make a note.

07:57.870 --> 07:58.504
Tanna?

07:59.969 --> 08:01.111
- Tanna? 
- What?

08:01.264 --> 08:02.924
- Where did this come from? 
- What?

08:03.103 --> 08:05.964
This - the furniture, the couch, the chairs, the rug.

08:06.179 --> 08:08.822
I don't know. It must've been here when I got back.

08:12.421 --> 08:12.953
Hello?

08:13.122 --> 08:16.624
I was going to wait until you called me, but my life isn't as long as yours.

08:16.875 --> 08:18.611
- Did you sit on the couch? 
- The couch?

08:18.770 --> 08:21.637
I didn't want to get it too soft because I knew you would be studying there

08:21.729 --> 08:24.632
as well as watching television, and you would need a little bit of support.

08:24.970 --> 08:26.967
- You did this? 
- Of course I did it.

08:27.141 --> 08:29.984
My granddaughter's a Yalie now. She needs to live like a Yalie.

08:30.249 --> 08:32.158
But how? When?

08:32.424 --> 08:34.529
I snuck in yesterday when you were in classes

08:34.707 --> 08:36.919
just to measure to make sure everything would fit.

08:37.114 --> 08:40.990
Then I had to butter up your dippy freshman counselor so she'd let the movers in.

08:41.414 --> 08:43.238
Did you look in the entertainment center yet?

08:43.443 --> 08:44.140
No.

08:45.804 --> 08:50.216
That's a plasma TV with a VCR and a DVD player.

08:50.416 --> 08:53.412
There's also a five-CD changer and a turntable,

08:53.561 --> 08:56.924
and the whole thing is wired in 5.1 surround sound.

08:57.114 --> 08:59.034
Now I have no idea what that means,

08:59.161 --> 09:01.425
but the man who installed it said to get

09:02.015 --> 09:04.077
Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon.

09:04.220 --> 09:05.751
It's supposed to be amazing.

09:05.899 --> 09:10.226
Grandma, this is all really sweet, but I have roommates, you know?

09:10.380 --> 09:12.151
And this might make them a little uncomfortable.

09:12.310 --> 09:13.359
Uncomfortable about what?

09:13.525 --> 09:17.993
Well, this is a common room. It is common to all of us.

09:18.152 --> 09:22.029
Four of us who live here. There are four of us who live here together.

09:22.371 --> 09:24.727
And the common room... it's what we all have in common.

09:24.880 --> 09:28.100
Oh, just show them how to use the remote. I'm sure they'll be fine with everything.

09:28.249 --> 09:30.989
Grandma, I worry that by you giving me all these things,

09:31.074 --> 09:32.805
it kind of makes it my room.

09:33.123 --> 09:34.331
- Exactly. 
- What?

09:34.582 --> 09:37.460
Never underestimate the value of the upper hand, Rory.

09:37.732 --> 09:39.328
You are in the real world now.

09:39.615 --> 09:41.387
- Status matters. 
- But...

09:41.526 --> 09:43.696
Your grandfather and I are very proud of you.

09:43.846 --> 09:46.210
Enjoy the furniture. We'll see you on Friday.

09:46.491 --> 09:48.146
Okay, see you Friday.

09:50.051 --> 09:53.368
My grandmother broke into our room and furnished it.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.641
Did she put that fireplace in, too?

09:55.861 --> 09:57.782
No, Tanna, the fireplace was always...

09:59.501 --> 10:01.596
Hey, why don't we take a little tour of the place, okay?

10:02.092 --> 10:03.322
- Great. 
- Yeah.

10:26.624 --> 10:29.018
They burnt my fries, forgot to give me an extra side of barbecue sauce,

10:29.080 --> 10:30.739
the jeep is making that crunchy sound again,

10:30.806 --> 10:32.942
and I have to spend my evening making elf ears

10:33.002 --> 10:34.711
for Aaron Thompson's Lord of the Rings party.

10:34.778 --> 10:38.081
Grandma broke into my dorm and redid the entire common room

10:38.143 --> 10:41.168
in $25,000 worth of furniture and stereo equipment.

10:41.281 --> 10:42.715
- You win. 
- It's unbelievable.

10:42.991 --> 10:45.142
You should see this place. I feel like I'm at Uday's house.

10:45.265 --> 10:46.822
Okay, tell me the whole story.

10:47.041 --> 10:50.250
I came home and all the normal furniture was gone

10:50.400 --> 10:51.925
and all this stuff was in here.

10:52.043 --> 10:53.279
What did your roommates say?

10:53.400 --> 10:56.473
Tanna still doesn't know she's at Yale, Paris saw it and said nothing.

10:56.614 --> 10:57.782
Oh, so that's coming.

10:57.921 --> 10:59.590
Janet's out jogging so I don't know what she thinks,

10:59.754 --> 11:02.836
but I have to hope she's pleased 'cause that girl's in shape and can kick my butt.

11:03.015 --> 11:05.780
Well, just make sure there's something she likes on the TV when she gets home.

11:05.867 --> 11:09.181
Something soothing to runners - maybe something that goes in a circle over and over.

11:09.359 --> 11:11.704
This is bad. This is a total invasion of privacy.

11:11.817 --> 11:13.404
- I know. 
- She didn't even ask.

11:13.644 --> 11:15.391
She got rid of everything that was in here.

11:15.519 --> 11:17.844
What if some of that furniture belonged to someone and they wanted it?

11:17.996 --> 11:18.994
I don't know what she was thinking.

11:19.170 --> 11:22.635
She was thinking, "Rory's life - mine. Must cover with chenille."

11:22.780 --> 11:25.144
- I can't believe she did this. 
- Oh, yes, you can.

11:25.329 --> 11:27.321
- Excuse me? 
- Rory, come on, it's my mother.

11:27.403 --> 11:29.538
It's Emily Gilmore. This is what she does.

11:29.645 --> 11:31.929
You've seen her pull stunts like this on me for years.

11:32.068 --> 11:33.142
Yeah, but that was you.

11:33.275 --> 11:35.595
 I told you when you borrowed that money from her that this is what you were getting into.

11:35.717 --> 11:36.936
I can't believe you're gloating.

11:37.038 --> 11:39.372
I'm not gloating. I'm just saying, when you sleep with dogs,

11:39.486 --> 11:41.262
you wake up with an entertainment center.

11:41.420 --> 11:42.630
Fine, so what do I do?

11:42.716 --> 11:45.670
Well, you could come out and say, "Grandma, this furniture is very nice.

11:45.834 --> 11:48.805
I appreciate the gesture, but this is a dorm room,

11:48.902 --> 11:51.845
and I cannot guarantee that the other people will love it as much as I do,

11:51.938 --> 11:54.006
and I worry about expensive equipment getting stolen,

11:54.072 --> 11:55.813
and it's just maybe too much right now."

11:55.997 --> 11:57.293
- That sounds good. 
- Okay.

11:57.468 --> 11:59.869
And then my mother will say, "Rory, your grandfather and I

11:59.915 --> 12:01.522
are paying for you to go to Yale.

12:01.661 --> 12:04.117
We are enabling you to have this rarefied education,

12:04.200 --> 12:06.708
and you're being ungrateful and small-minded, and I resent it.

12:06.837 --> 12:09.203
I am hurt on a level you will not be able to understand

12:09.305 --> 12:12.347
until you yourself have a daughter or a granddaughter

12:12.418 --> 12:15.762
who will cut your heart out the way you've just cut mine out,

12:15.828 --> 12:18.044
and I hope that small veneer of independence

12:18.096 --> 12:20.533
that you've extracted from this incident is worth the complete

12:20.580 --> 12:23.216
and total alienation of the grandparents who have done nothing

12:23.313 --> 12:25.725
but love you and thought of you only."

12:25.833 --> 12:27.271
Or I could keep the furniture.

12:27.445 --> 12:28.342
Yes, you could.

12:28.777 --> 12:29.601
This is great.

12:30.408 --> 12:33.676
Hon, seriously, if you feel strongly, say something.

12:34.049 --> 12:36.400
I just want you to be prepared, that's all.

12:36.880 --> 12:37.454
I know.

12:37.712 --> 12:40.234
And take heart in knowing that when it comes to controlling a person,

12:40.368 --> 12:43.245
my mother targeted my soul, my independence,

12:43.322 --> 12:46.778
and my entire future, and at least with you, she threw in an ottoman.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.451
Emily? I'm home.

12:52.615 --> 12:55.064
I keep wanting to give this room a little spruce,

12:55.155 --> 12:57.879
but for the life of me, every one of these fabrics gives me a headache.

12:58.406 --> 13:00.392
- What do you think of this one? 
- Hm? It's fine.

13:01.077 --> 13:03.649
Well, that's just the sort of enthusiasm I was looking for.

13:04.001 --> 13:05.569
Emily, you have excellent taste.

13:05.697 --> 13:07.725
I'm sure whichever one you pick will look lovely.

13:08.721 --> 13:11.893
- Do you need some ice? 
- No. A taller glass.

13:12.482 --> 13:14.990
- You sound tired. 
- It's been a very long day.

13:15.384 --> 13:17.018
You know, some men retire.

13:17.282 --> 13:20.887
Yes, and some men tattoo their mother's names on their biceps.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.330
I don't think the two are necessarily linked.

13:23.909 --> 13:25.056
I'm fine, Emily.

13:25.358 --> 13:28.122
I just need a drink and a nice meal, and I'll be good as new.

13:28.828 --> 13:30.723
You got a call from Jason Stiles today.

13:32.433 --> 13:33.330
Digger Stiles?

13:34.175 --> 13:35.727
- What did he want? 
- To talk to you.

13:35.991 --> 13:37.155
I have nothing to say to him.

13:37.338 --> 13:39.147
He might have something interesting to tell you.

13:39.572 --> 13:43.779
What - that the turncoat company I used to work for is cutting my pension?

13:44.102 --> 13:47.887
That the stock they gave me when they unceremoniously forced me out has been rescinded?

13:47.942 --> 13:50.518
Yes. That, or hello.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.303
He's probably been sent to do his father's dirty work.

13:53.824 --> 13:57.517
It's not enough to fire me, they have to continue to harass me now that I'm gone.

13:57.712 --> 13:59.222
I thought you always liked Digger.

13:59.416 --> 14:02.145
Yes, I liked Digger when he was fetching my coffee.

14:02.319 --> 14:04.475
I liked Digger when he was refilling my stapler.

14:04.633 --> 14:08.330
But I do not like Digger now that he is his father's heir apparent and sent to annoy me.

14:08.488 --> 14:10.455
And I certainly don't understand your need to defend him.

14:10.610 --> 14:12.129
I'm not defending him.

14:12.473 --> 14:14.966
If you don't want to return the boy's call, don't return his call.

14:15.206 --> 14:15.893
Thank you.

14:16.067 --> 14:18.530
I invited him over tomorrow anyway. You can find out what he wants then.

14:18.836 --> 14:19.646
You did what?

14:19.850 --> 14:21.995
He was absolutely insistent that he talk to you.

14:22.124 --> 14:24.812
- Why would you do that? 
- It was the polite thing to do.

14:25.048 --> 14:27.152
If you don't want him to come over, I have his number.

14:27.259 --> 14:29.389
You may call him and disinvite him. It's up to you.

14:29.599 --> 14:32.768
Fine, he can come over, but he is not staying for a drink.

14:32.875 --> 14:34.944
He can come in and deliver his message and then leave.

14:35.149 --> 14:36.265
Whatever you say.

14:36.419 --> 14:38.487
That's it - no drink, no handshake, nothing.

14:38.661 --> 14:41.314
I'll even hide the liquor bottles so he doesn't get any bright ideas.

14:41.462 --> 14:45.053
It's extremely comforting to have such a supportive wife in times like these.

14:45.190 --> 14:46.127
I'm so glad.

14:47.697 --> 14:48.917
- Did you hear? 
- Hear what?

14:49.111 --> 14:50.853
The first party of the year is going to be on our floor.

14:50.950 --> 14:53.714
Technically, it's to celebrate the first week of classes,

14:53.802 --> 14:57.969
but I'm anticipating the themes quickly degenerating to "Hey, walking works -- let's drink."

14:58.077 --> 15:00.402
The important thing is that this party, the first party,

15:00.472 --> 15:02.331
is going to be on our floor. Our floor.

15:02.506 --> 15:03.452
Yes, our floor.

15:03.985 --> 15:06.812
Anyhow, the way it works is that anyone who wants to be apart of the party

15:06.888 --> 15:09.530
will just leave their door open so people can just wander in and out.

15:09.628 --> 15:11.594
- So what do you think? 
- About what?

15:11.717 --> 15:13.764
Leaving our door open. It's the perfect opportunity

15:13.815 --> 15:15.628
to solidify our social standing at Yale.

15:15.700 --> 15:18.563
It'll virtually guarantee invitations to every other party thrown this year,

15:18.649 --> 15:21.116
- and we'll get our faces in people's heads. 
- I don't know.

15:21.229 --> 15:23.585
What, what don't you know? I've explained the entire thing to you.

15:23.707 --> 15:26.043
I'm not sure I want to leave our door open to a bunch of strangers.

15:26.171 --> 15:28.336
They won't be strangers once they come in and say howdy.

15:28.454 --> 15:30.861
Yeah, but I'm not sure how I'm gonna feel that night. I might be tired.

15:31.024 --> 15:33.333
For God's sakes, Grandpa, you're eighteen. Sleep when you're dead.

15:33.445 --> 15:34.855
Look, we can still go to the party.

15:34.973 --> 15:37.117
We can meet people, you can solidify your social status,

15:37.251 --> 15:39.744
get your face in people's heads, and I can bail when I feel like it.

15:39.821 --> 15:41.782
Going isn't the same. Going is passive.

15:41.961 --> 15:43.963
Opening your door, you are giving the party.

15:44.066 --> 15:46.298
You are responsible for the fun. People owe you.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.356
- Don't you want people to owe you? 
- I'm good, actually.

15:48.493 --> 15:50.823
Oh, sure, you're good. You're fine.

15:50.921 --> 15:54.494
After all, you have all this fancy furniture and a big TV to lord over people.

15:54.679 --> 15:57.746
It's the rest of us who are screwed - the ones whose grandparents hadn't thought

15:57.853 --> 16:00.834
- to provide suck-up furniture. 
- This is not suck-up furniture.

16:00.936 --> 16:03.357
You're being selfish. You don't care about anybody but yourself.

16:03.476 --> 16:05.267
- Paris. 
- No. I hate college!

16:05.697 --> 16:09.460
Okay, we've got costumes, we're got cutouts, we've got rings, ladies and gentlemen.

16:09.650 --> 16:12.158
We've got fairy necklaces, we've got tree heads.

16:12.256 --> 16:13.966
I'm picking up table decorations tomorrow.

16:14.084 --> 16:16.312
Oh, do you need me to order a Lord of the Rings cake?

16:16.407 --> 16:19.362
- The cake is under control. 
- Okay, cake's off my list.

16:19.676 --> 16:21.780
- So you've got the menu going, right? 
- Yes.

16:21.893 --> 16:25.543
Just festive kiddie food. You know, like, bagel dogs, tater tots,

16:25.635 --> 16:28.302
mini pizzas, mac and cheese. Oh, you know what would be great?

16:28.456 --> 16:32.067
Those colored popcorn balls. Rory used to go mental over those things.

16:32.270 --> 16:33.832
Hey, how many adults are gonna be there?

16:33.995 --> 16:35.787
- Probably about ten. 
- Okay.

16:37.662 --> 16:41.309
Okay, so I've scoured the entire store and here's what we got.

16:41.474 --> 16:42.434
Hit me.

16:42.521 --> 16:43.473
Horn of Gondor,

16:44.180 --> 16:47.363
Legolas' bow, and a cape.

16:47.451 --> 16:47.968
Cape for who?

16:48.291 --> 16:50.682
There's 4,000 people in that movie who wear capes - you can't pick one?

16:50.764 --> 16:51.905
Wow, you're crabby.

16:52.045 --> 16:53.648
Well, I wore a bracelet to school today.

16:53.944 --> 16:57.636
My parents were called. There was a special service in chapel,

16:57.701 --> 17:00.641
and I've been ordered to a soul-searching seminar next week.

17:00.758 --> 17:04.276
I'll be sitting between the nail-polish-wearing girl and the spicy condiment user.

17:04.362 --> 17:05.674
- I'm sorry. 
- That's okay.

17:05.771 --> 17:06.952
Leave the horn, the bow, and the bill.

17:07.722 --> 17:08.156
Right.

17:10.624 --> 17:11.111
Hello?

17:11.243 --> 17:12.371
I need to talk to you about Rory.

17:12.974 --> 17:14.971
- Paris? 
- She's not adjusting well.

17:15.038 --> 17:17.550
- I'm actually concerned about her. 
- Well, that's very...

17:17.660 --> 17:20.133
The socialization process in college is vitally important.

17:20.199 --> 17:23.220
The connections we make here can last a lifetime. They can alter the course of our future.

17:23.297 --> 17:24.746
- That's how important they are. 
- Okay.

17:24.837 --> 17:27.003
Now I'm sure it's tempting to emotionally stunt your daughter

17:27.090 --> 17:29.339
so she'll move back home and take care of you in your old age,

17:29.395 --> 17:30.706
but I thought you wanted better for her.

17:30.812 --> 17:33.000
Hey, Paris, did something happen between you and Rory?

17:33.123 --> 17:34.521
She won't open the door for the party.

17:34.629 --> 17:37.188
There's a party on our floor, and if you open your door,

17:37.244 --> 17:39.022
you get to be apart of it, but she won't open the door

17:39.092 --> 17:42.099
because she's busy being Heidi's grandfather, and if you were a real mother...

17:42.186 --> 17:43.820
Paris, you called my mother?

17:44.091 --> 17:45.897
- Well, you wouldn't listen to me. 
- Give me that phone!

17:47.991 --> 17:49.635
- Hello? 
- Hi, honey. How's school?

17:49.829 --> 17:51.570
I'm rooming with a Stephen King novel.

17:51.673 --> 17:54.094
- What's she talking about? 
- Oh, just some ridiculous party.

17:54.223 --> 17:56.610
I don't want to let a million strangers traipse through my room,

17:56.696 --> 17:59.056
so she's having a meltdown. I'm sorry she bothered you.

17:59.251 --> 18:00.668
- That's okay. 
- I'm gonna kill her.

18:00.767 --> 18:02.922
Remember, you cut off one head, she'll just grow another.

18:03.055 --> 18:04.528
- So tell me about the party. 
- It's nothing,

18:04.631 --> 18:06.481
it's just a "first week of class" kind of thing.

18:06.726 --> 18:08.000
- Are you going? 
- Maybe.

18:08.164 --> 18:12.189
You know, it might not be such a bad idea to get to know the people in your building,

18:12.317 --> 18:14.744
see who's gonna be the ones to have the emergency Pop Tarts on hand.

18:14.907 --> 18:15.763
I'll get to know them.

18:15.905 --> 18:17.771
A party might be kind of a fun way to do it.

18:18.067 --> 18:21.206
I'm sorry, are you telling me to let Paris open the door to the world?

18:21.302 --> 18:24.851
I'm not telling you anything. I just want to make sure that at the end of four years,

18:24.948 --> 18:28.199
you've not only read every book in the Yale library, you've also had some fun.

18:28.363 --> 18:29.275
I will have fun.

18:29.361 --> 18:32.086
But I can see you the night of the party holing up in your room

18:32.194 --> 18:33.586
with a book for the entire evening.

18:33.847 --> 18:35.982
You know when I do that, I'm not hiding. I enjoy it.

18:36.223 --> 18:38.050
And I'm making friends - you saw me make friends.

18:38.148 --> 18:40.502
I know, but I'm not just talking about making friends.

18:40.606 --> 18:41.967
I'm talking about experiencing things.

18:42.576 --> 18:44.946
Parties, football games, protests, barn burnings.

18:45.089 --> 18:46.846
Very big amongst the kids these days.

18:46.928 --> 18:48.418
Those are all experiences.

18:48.562 --> 18:50.676
Maybe dumb experiences, but you never know

18:50.748 --> 18:54.285
when you're accidentally gonna stumble across something that could be... something.

18:54.424 --> 18:56.825
- Fine, I'll open the door. 
- Yes!

18:57.148 --> 19:00.158
- This isn't for you! 
- Like I care about the reason.

19:00.359 --> 19:02.329
- You might have fun. 
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:02.743 --> 19:04.772
- Call me later. 
- If I don't, I'm sure Paris will.

19:05.032 --> 19:06.963
- Tell her thanks for me. 
- I will not!

19:09.805 --> 19:11.955
- What do you think? 
- What is that?

19:12.073 --> 19:14.060
Well, you said I could borrow something to wear to the party.

19:14.197 --> 19:17.720
Yeah, I did, but that's my Chilton uniform.

19:18.637 --> 19:21.673
My mom probably threw it in for a joke.

19:22.528 --> 19:25.400
It's my high-school uniform. I wore it every day to...

19:27.429 --> 19:29.179
you know, there's a tie in there that goes with it.

19:31.960 --> 19:35.154
Okay, I've scoped out the other open rooms and no one seems to have copped

19:35.232 --> 19:37.095
a clear identity yet, which leaves the field wide open.

19:37.254 --> 19:38.426
So what do you think we should be?

19:38.697 --> 19:40.859
We've got a lot of seating, so we could be the make-out room.

19:41.073 --> 19:44.371
Or we could crank the stereo up and push the furniture aside and be the dance room.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.547
Or we could throw down some towels and be the keg room.

19:46.649 --> 19:48.738
I don't want an identity. You already made me open the door.

19:48.829 --> 19:51.124
I opened the door. We're the open-door room. That's it.

19:51.185 --> 19:52.507
How about some low lighting and some candles?

19:52.578 --> 19:53.971
We could be the meaningful-conversation room.

19:54.129 --> 19:55.235
- No themes. 
- But...

19:55.373 --> 19:57.268
No one knows me here, Rory.

19:57.370 --> 19:58.651
Do you understand what that means?

19:58.824 --> 20:00.509
It means I can start all over.

20:00.667 --> 20:04.553
I can wipe out the last eighteen years and introduce people to the new Paris Geller,

20:04.774 --> 20:06.274
the fun Paris Geller.

20:06.618 --> 20:10.565
I just want everything to be different this year, that's all.

20:11.298 --> 20:12.827
- One candle. 
- Thank you, thank you.

20:14.273 --> 20:15.531
No, seriously, give me the ring.

20:15.669 --> 20:16.904
- No way. 
- Five bucks.

20:17.057 --> 20:18.516
- No. 
- Just let me hold it.

20:18.629 --> 20:19.453
Forget it.

20:19.622 --> 20:23.590
Come on, I promise I'll give it right back, my precious.

20:23.970 --> 20:26.499
- I mean, Roger. 
- You're crazy.

20:26.867 --> 20:29.196
What? You're the one with the pointy ears, my friend.

20:29.601 --> 20:33.104
Here we go. I'd like you to meet Redmond and Riley James.

20:33.323 --> 20:34.824
Redmond, Riley, nice to meet you.

20:35.119 --> 20:38.182
I'm Julie, your cruise director. I'm here to help you with your costumes.

20:38.265 --> 20:40.276
- I want to be Legolas. 
- I want to be Gimli.

20:40.372 --> 20:42.877
- I want to be Gimli, too. 
- Okay, two Gimlis coming up.

20:43.133 --> 20:44.819
Lorelai, my hood is loose!

20:45.397 --> 20:47.107
Her name is Julie, stupid.

20:47.276 --> 20:49.350
No, it's not, retard!

20:49.671 --> 20:51.878
She just told us her name was Julie. She's our cruise director.

20:52.123 --> 20:53.604
What's a cruise director?

20:53.777 --> 20:55.580
I don't know, but you fart with your face.

20:55.672 --> 20:58.334
Hey, love, guys. Love, okay?

20:58.399 --> 21:00.152
Lord of the Rings is all about the love.

21:00.352 --> 21:03.962
Nuh uh, it's about the destruction of all mankind.

21:04.033 --> 21:07.171
And who doesn't love that? You're fixed. Go play - lovingly.

21:08.233 --> 21:10.786
Lorelai, some of the kids are asking for swords. Did you bring swords?

21:10.895 --> 21:12.362
- Oh, no, I didn't. 
- Oh, thank God.

21:13.531 --> 21:15.656
Oh, the Raymonds - I forgot we made up. Will you excuse me?

21:15.717 --> 21:16.399
Absolutely.

21:16.511 --> 21:19.338
Riley said only boy hobbits can travel to Mount Doom.

21:19.818 --> 21:20.935
Is that true?

21:21.323 --> 21:24.360
In the movie, only boy hobbits travel to Mount Doom,

21:24.427 --> 21:27.776
but that's only because the girls went to do something even more dangerous.

21:27.917 --> 21:28.572
What?

21:28.769 --> 21:30.474
Have you ever heard of a Brazilian bikini wax?

21:31.005 --> 21:32.618
- Lorelai! 
- Oh, great, you're here.

21:32.860 --> 21:34.640
So girls go on adventures, too?

21:34.748 --> 21:36.649
- And they go in heels. 
- Good.

21:38.951 --> 21:39.904
Are Rawley and Cheech here?

21:40.038 --> 21:41.267
Yup, they've been chopping away for an hour.

21:41.436 --> 21:44.103
Perfect. Wow, there is a full house, isn't there?

21:44.385 --> 21:46.090
- You have enough costumes? 
- We're good.

21:46.421 --> 21:49.756
The screen's up, the tables are set, and four kids are crying, so we're right on schedule.

21:50.211 --> 21:51.461
Well, I better get in the kitchen.

21:51.672 --> 21:55.463
All right, because it's coming up on elevenses and the hobbits are hungry, right?

21:55.572 --> 21:56.801
Right!

21:56.918 --> 21:58.745
I'm going, I'm going.

21:58.822 --> 22:00.522
Hey, who wants a sword?

22:00.733 --> 22:02.448
- Me!
- Me!

22:06.058 --> 22:08.120
Well, Jason Stiles, look at you.

22:08.382 --> 22:11.669
Look at me - look at you. I've just got a trainer. You have cheated God.

22:11.776 --> 22:14.091
You've been here one minute and you're already starting with the flattery.

22:14.218 --> 22:16.101
I apologize. It is lovely to see you, Emily.

22:16.595 --> 22:18.560
It's lovely to see you also.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.878
So, did you sell your soul to the devil or...

22:22.026 --> 22:24.121
- How's your mother? 
- She is exactly the same.

22:24.279 --> 22:26.502
- And her horses? 
- Have a better life than I do.

22:27.025 --> 22:29.942
- Well, Richard is in his study. 
- I would expect no less.

22:30.972 --> 22:31.571
Come in.

22:32.819 --> 22:34.730
Richard, there's someone here to see you.

22:34.889 --> 22:37.541
Hello, Richard. I appreciate you taking the time to do this.

22:37.792 --> 22:41.201
Well, I'll leave you two alone. Jason, be sure and say goodbye before you leave.

22:41.324 --> 22:41.919
I'll do that.

22:44.719 --> 22:46.286
- So, how have you been? 
- Fine.

22:46.654 --> 22:48.083
- May I sit? 
- Your choice.

22:48.252 --> 22:51.012
- I hear your business is going well. 
- You hear correctly.

22:51.201 --> 22:53.420
No reason for it not to be going well. You were always the best.

22:53.991 --> 22:57.068
Is that what you came here to tell me, how competent I was at my job?

22:57.247 --> 22:59.899
Nope, I came here to make you a proposition.

23:00.463 --> 23:02.517
- Go ahead and make it. 
- I want to be your partner.

23:03.587 --> 23:05.588
- Excuse me? 
- I want to join forces with you.

23:05.716 --> 23:08.384
You know, put a desk in your office, get a copy of the key,

23:08.466 --> 23:10.386
maybe snag some of that fancy stationery to write on.

23:10.473 --> 23:12.869
- You're not serious. 
- I'm prepared to buy my way in.

23:13.028 --> 23:16.725
I am also prepared to bring all of my current clients, and that should be appealing to you,

23:16.811 --> 23:19.188
even if sharing an office and parting with some stationery is not.

23:19.853 --> 23:22.685
Think about it. I could make your company an instant contender,

23:22.761 --> 23:25.621
with my youth and my clients and your reputation and respectability.

23:25.956 --> 23:28.192
It's a pretty interesting package, don't you think?

23:28.921 --> 23:30.696
- You want to become my partner. 
- Yes.

23:30.836 --> 23:34.425
You want to pay me and bring a whole slew of high-paying clients with you.

23:34.578 --> 23:36.073
You keep leaving out the stationery.

23:36.734 --> 23:38.289
Thank you for coming, Jason.

23:39.334 --> 23:41.398
- Is something wrong? 
- Yes, something's wrong.

23:41.490 --> 23:44.522
- I don't appreciate you wasting my time. 
- I didn't know that I was.

23:44.613 --> 23:48.258
- Am I such a joke to you that you feel you can come in here... 
- You're no joke.

23:48.354 --> 23:51.239
-  ...and take my time away from important things? 
- I assure you you are no joke.

23:51.317 --> 23:53.113
You were the best my father's company ever had.

23:53.226 --> 23:55.022
You're damn right I was the best that company had,

23:55.166 --> 23:57.475
and now I am the best competition they will ever have.

23:57.597 --> 23:58.269
Not yet.

23:59.196 --> 24:01.269
- But with me, you could be. 
- Why?

24:01.422 --> 24:04.392
Why would you think I'd believe you were serious about this?

24:04.516 --> 24:07.474
When was the last time I stuck a whoopee cushion on your chair, Richard?

24:07.623 --> 24:09.876
Your father started that company. He made that company.

24:10.004 --> 24:10.715
With you.

24:10.849 --> 24:12.190
You've been working there since you were a kid.

24:12.368 --> 24:14.018
All the way through Harvard, you worked there.

24:14.242 --> 24:15.765
You've been groomed to take that company over,

24:15.893 --> 24:17.828
and now you're telling me you want to leave?

24:17.909 --> 24:18.887
- Yes. 
- Why?

24:19.180 --> 24:21.068
Because I want to do something on my own.

24:21.150 --> 24:23.992
I want to work someplace that hasn't known me since I was six.

24:24.131 --> 24:27.064
I'd like to get through an entire day without being called Digger.

24:27.171 --> 24:30.294
And I really, really want to piss off my dad.

24:30.935 --> 24:33.115
- You what? 
- Can you imagine his face?

24:33.250 --> 24:35.133
No, really, take a moment.

24:35.702 --> 24:40.109
Picture it. I walk into his office, he's sitting in his enormous red-leather chair,

24:40.274 --> 24:44.878
and I say, "Dad, I am leaving. I am taking all of my high-paying clients with me,

24:44.984 --> 24:46.715
and I am getting into business with Richard Gilmore,

24:46.803 --> 24:48.779
the man you forced out to make room for me."

24:49.443 --> 24:50.505
Can you see that face?

24:50.888 --> 24:54.702
- I can see it. 
- It's a pretty good face, isn't it?

24:55.522 --> 24:57.022
It is rather satisfying.

24:58.864 --> 24:59.500
So...

25:02.137 --> 25:04.456
- what do you say? 
- You hate your father that much?

25:05.045 --> 25:07.467
I don't hate him. I just don't want to be him.

25:08.490 --> 25:13.149
Jason, would you care to join me for a drink?

25:13.492 --> 25:14.108
Gladly.

25:16.474 --> 25:18.911
Emily, Jason's going to join us for a drink.

25:19.376 --> 25:21.138
He is? Well, how nice.

25:21.583 --> 25:23.022
Richard, would you mind if I borrowed your phone?

25:23.170 --> 25:24.844
Not at all. You can use the one in my study.

25:24.968 --> 25:25.816
Thank you. I'll be right out.

25:27.210 --> 25:30.052
- So, I see your meeting went well. 
- It was actually very interesting.

25:30.298 --> 25:32.084
- Really? 
- He wants to be my business partner.

25:32.375 --> 25:34.962
What? But what about his father and his company?

25:35.136 --> 25:37.116
He wants to leave. He wants to work with the best.

25:37.691 --> 25:41.141
- Well, good for Digger. 
- I always did like that boy.

25:41.366 --> 25:42.206
So what did you say?

25:42.744 --> 25:44.505
Well, I told him I would have to think about it.

25:44.628 --> 25:46.691
I mean, it's not as if I need anyone working with me.

25:46.998 --> 25:49.768
Things are going very well. I'm building a very solid client base.

25:49.927 --> 25:51.862
It would be nice for you not to have to work so hard.

25:52.026 --> 25:53.548
I don't mind hard work, Emily.

25:53.695 --> 25:56.945
I know you don't mind it. I just said that it would be nice if you didn't have to do it.

25:57.089 --> 25:59.280
- Well... 
- Jason's a very nice boy.

25:59.441 --> 26:01.217
Yes, he is.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.330
He is a very nice boy.

26:04.607 --> 26:06.526
- What are you doing? 
- I'm getting the tables ready.

26:06.825 --> 26:08.985
- They were ready. 
- No, ready for the food.

26:09.117 --> 26:10.935
- They were ready for the food. 
- No, they weren't.

26:11.082 --> 26:12.470
Yes, they were. I set them myself.

26:12.819 --> 26:14.739
- But where were the tablecloths? 
- Right here.

26:15.497 --> 26:17.318
- There. 
- They're paper.

26:17.550 --> 26:18.591
Yes, they are.

26:18.982 --> 26:20.386
And there's monsters on them.

26:20.621 --> 26:22.046
No, they're Lord of the Rings characters,

26:22.194 --> 26:24.804
which is rather appropriate since this is a Lord of the Rings party.

26:24.999 --> 26:26.402
So this is the table?

26:26.571 --> 26:31.113
- And the paper cups and plates... 
- All there on purpose.

26:31.271 --> 26:32.846
I thought you just put them out for the kids to see.

26:32.981 --> 26:33.719
And use.

26:33.913 --> 26:37.513
But the chafing dish looks so much better on the white tablecloth.

26:37.625 --> 26:39.448
You shouldn't have a chafing dish out here.

26:39.740 --> 26:40.401
Why not?

26:40.662 --> 26:42.991
Because a chafing dish has a candle, and a candle has a flame,

26:43.120 --> 26:44.911
and a kid could stick his finger in there and get hurt.

26:45.040 --> 26:45.914
Isn't that how they learn?

26:46.049 --> 26:47.676
- Let's heat things up in the kitchen. 
- Fine.

26:49.142 --> 26:50.952
You made brie.

26:52.410 --> 26:55.808
With lavender honey and bourbon-sugared pecans.

26:55.899 --> 26:57.937
I thought it would go nicely with the crudités platter.

26:58.111 --> 26:59.657
Please tell me you made food for the kids.

26:59.882 --> 27:01.101
I did make food for the kids.

27:01.233 --> 27:02.565
These kids - not the Romanov kids.

27:02.780 --> 27:05.473
I just put this out in case anyone over the age of ten gets hungry.

27:05.637 --> 27:07.670
- There are parents here, too, you know. 
- I know.

27:07.824 --> 27:10.373
Parents whose responsibility it would be to keep their kid

27:10.491 --> 27:14.270
from hitting another kid or putting their fingers under a chafing dish.

27:14.424 --> 27:15.810
- Sookie... 
- Fine.

27:16.779 --> 27:18.427
Hey, having a good time?

27:18.939 --> 27:20.999
I'm Paris Geller, suite five.

27:21.429 --> 27:25.523
It's open. It's got a candle - perfect for some deep conversation.

27:25.698 --> 27:29.543
Prepare two to five subjects to discuss so that the conversation doesn't lag

27:29.613 --> 27:31.207
and totally ruin the vibe. Party on.

27:36.587 --> 27:40.101
So, I did a survey of all the rooms and, by far, ours is the best.

27:40.177 --> 27:40.685
Great.

27:40.772 --> 27:43.315
Three is way too cluttered. Four has developed a weird smell.

27:43.531 --> 27:46.296
Two was a contender for awhile until I started telling everyone

27:46.367 --> 27:48.104
that the girl who lives there was waitlisted.

27:48.328 --> 27:49.916
I'm gonna get out there and mingle.

27:50.259 --> 27:51.257
This is a great party.

28:19.597 --> 28:20.160
Rory!

28:21.224 --> 28:23.780
Oh, my God! Madeline, Louise, what are you doing here?

28:24.041 --> 28:24.651
Party, baby.

28:25.500 --> 28:26.627
 I thought you were supposed to be at Mills.

28:26.774 --> 28:27.440
- Where? 
- Mills?

28:27.655 --> 28:28.464
- Where? 
- No more Mills?

28:28.787 --> 28:30.682
Mills went bye-bye before I unpacked my shoes.

28:30.882 --> 28:32.375
She's been hanging out at Tulane with me.

28:32.565 --> 28:34.593
I love New Orleans. I am so southern.

28:34.839 --> 28:35.473
What are you doing here?

28:35.674 --> 28:38.085
We went online and found out where all the first week of class parties were,

28:38.166 --> 28:39.975
- and we're making the rounds. 
- We hit Harvard next.

28:40.076 --> 28:42.120
- That's where my boyfriend goes. 
- Oh, you're dating a Harvard man?

28:42.318 --> 28:44.480
- He's gonna be a writer. 
- Well, he hopes.

28:44.726 --> 28:46.441
Right now, he's totally freaked that The Simpsons

28:46.513 --> 28:48.294
are going to be off the air by the time he graduates.

28:48.422 --> 28:50.357
It's good to see you guys. Paris is around here somewhere.

28:50.490 --> 28:51.945
I hope she's in back of that guy over there

28:52.027 --> 28:53.128
because that's where I'm heading.

28:53.880 --> 28:55.099
- We'll be back. 
- Good luck.

29:02.072 --> 29:03.358
- Rory Gilmore? 
- Are you Rory Gilmore?

29:03.490 --> 29:04.408
Yes, I'm Rory Gilmore.

29:04.634 --> 29:06.261
- Rory... what can we do with that? 
- Ro-ro?

29:06.362 --> 29:07.300
- Ry-ror? 
- Her last name might help.

29:07.382 --> 29:09.128
- Gilmore. 
- Ro-gil? Gil-roy?

29:09.271 --> 29:11.043
- Excuse, me, what are you doing? 
- Giving you a nick.

29:11.131 --> 29:12.174
- A nickname. 
- Do I know you?

29:12.343 --> 29:14.930
We get so ahead of ourselves. We're like time travelers. I'm Kick.

29:15.027 --> 29:17.289
I'm Mickey. Your grandmother Emily told us to look you up.

29:17.401 --> 29:18.917
- My grandmother? 
- She's tight with our mom,

29:19.065 --> 29:22.978
D.A.R. darling. When she heard we were going to Yale, she laid down the law.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.327
To look you up and make sure you fell in with the right crowd.

29:25.425 --> 29:27.678
- Which would be us. 
- But we never settled on a nickname.

29:27.777 --> 29:29.583
I think we're still trying the last-first combo.

29:29.680 --> 29:31.416
Listen, I really appreciate you guys seeking me out,

29:31.508 --> 29:34.272
and it was really nice meeting you, but I actually have to go find my roommate.

29:34.431 --> 29:36.018
Do you have a middle name?

29:36.296 --> 29:38.204
- Yes, that might help. 
- When's your birthday?

29:38.373 --> 29:40.580
Oh, astrological nickname.

29:40.724 --> 29:42.874
- Very in. very, very in. 
- Seating.

29:43.541 --> 29:45.332
Ooh, great fabric.

29:45.455 --> 29:47.175
This is the furniture Emily bought.

29:47.462 --> 29:49.095
That's right. That woman does have taste.

29:49.213 --> 29:51.491
- I wish she'd talk to Mom. 
- Yeah, 'cause then we wouldn't have to.

29:51.589 --> 29:54.348
- Did Mom tell you about Christmas? 
- Yes. Hawaii.

29:54.445 --> 29:56.175
Can't even imagine what's going through her mind.

29:56.277 --> 29:58.316
Walt Disney could not imagine what was going through her mind.

29:59.621 --> 30:01.972
You want the guy that pumps your gas voting?

30:02.120 --> 30:04.157
- That is what America is about. 
- What ignorance!

30:04.373 --> 30:05.612
You're the ignorant one.

30:05.756 --> 30:09.765
I had a terrible dream the other night that everything they say about sunscreen is true.

30:09.918 --> 30:12.243
- I have had that dream. 
- I don't think I'm having fun.

30:12.545 --> 30:14.382
- Well, the party's not over yet. 
- I know.

30:14.658 --> 30:17.348
- What's with the Gabor sisters? 
- Friends from my grandmother.

30:17.485 --> 30:19.170
Great. Everybody has a group but me.

30:19.283 --> 30:20.209
What are you talking about?

30:20.485 --> 30:22.917
Janet's a runner, so she'll automatically be in the jock group.

30:23.185 --> 30:25.596
Tanna's a freak, so she'll be in the John Nash group.

30:25.759 --> 30:27.443
You've got your grandmother's obligation friends,

30:27.542 --> 30:30.152
and I'm stuck over there listening to a bad talk-radio session.

30:30.332 --> 30:31.131
This sucks.

30:31.320 --> 30:33.339
Well, we could just kick everyone out and just go to bed.

30:33.461 --> 30:35.774
No. I'll just have to try a little harder.

30:36.231 --> 30:37.162
I'm determined.

30:37.699 --> 30:39.071
Things are going to be different this year.

30:40.028 --> 30:42.769
Hey. pierce my ear.

30:43.092 --> 30:46.327
Okay, everybody out, now! This room is closed.

30:46.577 --> 30:49.758
Take your gross beer and your inane conversations somewhere else.

30:49.998 --> 30:51.509
- Move! 
- What's going on?

30:51.924 --> 30:55.261
I don't know. Looks like my roommate's kicking everybody out. Oh shoot.

30:55.445 --> 30:57.592
Hey, Bim and Bim, up. Let's move, now.

30:58.467 --> 31:01.934
Sorry. She's my roommate. What can I do? Call me.

31:15.198 --> 31:17.559
Lorelai, some of the kids are starting to get hungry.

31:17.691 --> 31:20.160
I think we should have the food ready to go the minute the movie's over.

31:20.288 --> 31:21.480
I agree. I'll get right on that.

31:24.938 --> 31:29.008
- Helen wants us to put the food on. 
- Oh, one step ahead of you.

31:29.137 --> 31:29.714
Good, good.

31:30.154 --> 31:31.834
So, what do we have here?

31:32.069 --> 31:34.302
A little lemon-garlic aioli for the blanched veggies.

31:34.441 --> 31:35.023
Oh, great.

31:35.224 --> 31:38.070
You think I should put the assorted charcuteries on this table or this one?

31:38.188 --> 31:40.263
It depends. Which one is the kids' table?

31:40.527 --> 31:43.190
There are no designated tables. I'm mixing and matching here.

31:44.723 --> 31:46.688
Oh, perfect. Right here.

31:47.040 --> 31:50.261
- Hello, gorgeous. What's your name? 
- Oh, boy. Wow.

31:50.742 --> 31:51.721
I'm hungry.

31:52.268 --> 31:54.173
- Would you like some gravlax? 
- Some what?

31:54.326 --> 31:55.483
Sookie, where's the kids' food?

31:55.750 --> 31:57.143
Okay, you need to relax.

31:57.373 --> 32:00.941
I haven't put the kids' food out yet because you wouldn't let me use the chafing dishes

32:01.003 --> 32:02.062
and I didn't want the food to get cold.

32:02.605 --> 32:03.947
- What did you just do? 
- Sookie.

32:04.014 --> 32:07.654
You just stuck that carrot in your mouth and then put it back on the platter.

32:07.762 --> 32:10.148
- Why would you do that? 
- It tastes like diapers.

32:10.245 --> 32:11.561
It does not taste like diapers.

32:11.730 --> 32:13.650
Honey, why don't you go sit down. I'll call you when dinner's ready.

32:13.829 --> 32:15.739
- You take it back! 
- Okay, come on.

32:17.782 --> 32:19.763
- What are you doing? 
- Where is it?

32:19.918 --> 32:22.037
- Where is what? 
- The food that doesn't taste like diapers.

32:22.186 --> 32:24.397
- You mean the kids' food? 
- Yes, the kids' food. Did you make any?

32:24.505 --> 32:26.466
- I'm not stupid. 
- I never said you were stupid.

32:26.604 --> 32:29.446
You know, I booked this gig. I'm the one who came to you and said,

32:29.508 --> 32:32.128
"Hey, you want to cater a kids' party with me?"

32:32.513 --> 32:36.594
Here. Here is the children's food for the children's birthday party, okay?

32:36.690 --> 32:38.084
- What is that? 
- It's macaroni and cheese.

32:38.176 --> 32:39.731
It's green. Why is it green?

32:39.881 --> 32:42.496
Because I made it with a jalapeno-chipotle cream sauce.

32:42.594 --> 32:43.613
Kids aren't gonna eat this.

32:43.813 --> 32:45.677
- When they try it... 
- They won't even try it.

32:45.769 --> 32:47.453
- Why not? 
- Because it's green.

32:47.561 --> 32:50.091
You haven't even offered it to them yet. They may surprise you.

32:50.218 --> 32:51.896
- Where is the rest of it? 
- The rest of what?

32:51.999 --> 32:53.808
- The rest of the kid food. 
- This is it.

32:54.202 --> 32:56.996
- Sookie! 
- They're small! How much can they eat?

32:57.100 --> 33:02.660
We talked about this. I mentioned hot dogs and pizza puffs and chips.

33:02.913 --> 33:05.758
I told you to make popcorn balls. Where the hell are the popcorn balls?

33:06.009 --> 33:07.375
You were serious about that?

33:07.719 --> 33:09.520
Oh, my God!

33:10.268 --> 33:11.854
Is that the cake?

33:12.255 --> 33:15.527
Of course it's the cake. You think I would go to a birthday party without a cake?

33:15.864 --> 33:17.304
What kind of cake is it, Sookie?

33:17.963 --> 33:18.869
Chocolate.

33:20.140 --> 33:22.950
With a rum-raisin, tropical-fruit ganache.

33:24.740 --> 33:27.246
Cheech? Uh, here.

33:28.142 --> 33:32.693
Go to Doose's, okay, and get, like, five boxes of frozen mini pizzas

33:32.822 --> 33:35.392
and five boxes of those pigs in a blanket and all the chips you can find.

33:35.484 --> 33:37.419
And then go to Weston's, get a couple dozen cupcakes,

33:37.496 --> 33:39.780
and have Mamie give you a couple of big bags of jimmies -

33:39.878 --> 33:41.977
like chocolate, rainbow, whatever.

33:42.273 --> 33:43.082
What are you doing?

33:43.246 --> 33:46.349
We'll have them decorate their own cupcakes. They'll love it. Okay, go.

33:46.682 --> 33:48.816
We're going to serve them cupcakes?

33:48.965 --> 33:51.597
Maybe they have something to tide them over for a little while.

33:51.725 --> 33:53.574
Hey, hey, I'm talking here.

33:53.717 --> 33:55.856
Yeah, I know. Just relax. It's gonna be fine.

33:55.990 --> 33:58.545
I know it's gonna be fine because I've been cooking all week long.

33:58.642 --> 34:01.448
I made four different cakes before choosing that particular one.

34:01.622 --> 34:03.644
So, yeah, I know it's gonna be fine.

34:03.772 --> 34:05.195
But the kids won't eat that.

34:05.304 --> 34:07.874
You know what, I'm getting a little tired of you telling me what the kids won't eat.

34:07.961 --> 34:10.213
You are supposed to plan the party, and I'm supposed to do the cooking.

34:10.388 --> 34:11.007
That's the arrangement. 

34:11.108 --> 34:13.188
Yes, but you have to think about the client, Sookie.

34:13.280 --> 34:16.752
I am thinking about the client. That cake is incredible.

34:16.916 --> 34:19.014
- Not if you're an 8-year-old. 
- How do you know?

34:19.110 --> 34:21.646
Because I had an 8-year-old, and she hung out with other 8-year-olds,

34:21.739 --> 34:23.960
and my taste right now is not that different from an 8-year-old.

34:24.072 --> 34:27.022
Okay, you can't just walk in and take over. That's not the arrangement.

34:27.103 --> 34:29.588
You're not in charge here. We're partners.

34:29.699 --> 34:31.134
- I know that. 
- I'm a great chef.

34:31.271 --> 34:34.964
A great chef does not have the client decorate his own cupcakes.

34:35.085 --> 34:38.204
- Can I have a juice box? 
- Hey, we're talking!

34:40.156 --> 34:41.312
Oh, yeah...

34:42.268 --> 34:44.154
What's the matter with her? Is she sick?

34:44.261 --> 34:46.340
Why is her mouth open? Lorelai, look at her face.

34:46.489 --> 34:49.367
Hi, honey. There's your juice. It's grape. Do you like grape?

34:49.617 --> 34:52.951
Me, too! It makes your tongue all purple.

34:53.411 --> 34:56.487
Now take your juice and go watch the rest of the movie, all right?

34:56.800 --> 34:58.398
You look very nice in your costume.

34:59.693 --> 35:02.771
Okay, Sookie, I didn't mean to just take over like that.

35:02.976 --> 35:07.609
I felt a crisis coming on so I snapped into problem-solving mode, and I didn't think.

35:07.916 --> 35:09.601
- I can't do this. 
- Yes, you can.

35:09.741 --> 35:11.767
We just need to be clearer on the menu next time.

35:11.935 --> 35:13.937
No, not this. This.

35:16.496 --> 35:17.793
Isn't it a little late?

35:17.952 --> 35:21.142
You saw me with that little girl. I mean, and her face...

35:21.387 --> 35:23.702
- I made that face. 
- You were upset.

35:23.854 --> 35:27.870
This is not right. This is all wrong. I don't...

35:28.237 --> 35:29.866
I don't want to be pregnant anymore!

35:30.998 --> 35:32.353
What are you gonna do, walk it off?

35:33.490 --> 35:34.448
Sookie, Sookie...

35:36.794 --> 35:40.525
- Where are you going? 
- A child is not a duvet cover.

35:40.659 --> 35:42.795
You can't just take it back if it doesn't like you.

35:42.942 --> 35:45.765
Luckily, duvet covers notoriously like whoever they go home with.

35:45.831 --> 35:46.885
They're like golden retrievers.

35:46.982 --> 35:49.579
You know what happens when kids don't like you? They tie you to a chair.

35:49.691 --> 35:52.772
They brain you with a bat. They set fire to the house and blame it on the neighbors.

35:52.850 --> 35:54.939
Wow, now you can't have kids or live next door to them.

35:55.025 --> 35:57.100
I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know how to feed them,

35:57.196 --> 35:59.767
I cover up their party cloths, and I set their fingers on fire.

35:59.876 --> 36:00.745
Just this once.

36:00.878 --> 36:05.271
I make them eat jalapeno-chipotle cream sauce. I'm Mommie Dearest.

36:05.358 --> 36:07.551
- Okay, back in the kitchen. 
- No, I can't go back.

36:07.657 --> 36:09.096
- I've got hummus in there. 
- Come on.

36:09.495 --> 36:10.734
God knows what I'll do with it!

36:12.526 --> 36:16.383
Rawley, could you just go make sure the kids have enough soda?

36:18.003 --> 36:20.484
- You just have to calm down. 
- I can't have it.

36:20.580 --> 36:21.835
- Yes, you can. 
- No, I can't.

36:21.932 --> 36:24.866
I'm gonna fail. Get it out, get it out, get it out!

36:25.280 --> 36:27.907
Stop. Breathe. Drink.

36:30.211 --> 36:31.516
Everything's gonna be fine.

36:32.185 --> 36:35.285
Kids don't like me, and I'm not so sure I like them.

36:35.397 --> 36:36.437
You'll like your kid.

36:36.621 --> 36:38.881
You know at family gatherings when everyone goes into the living room,

36:39.131 --> 36:41.035
gathers around, watches the kids? I read.

36:41.147 --> 36:43.169
Jackson's sister has a little girl, six years old.

36:43.297 --> 36:46.370
She likes to get up in front of the family after dinner and sing Mariah Carey songs.

36:46.487 --> 36:49.310
I heckle. I have no desire to play with them.

36:49.452 --> 36:53.170
Easter egg hunts bore me. I have never borrowed the neighbor's kid

36:53.277 --> 36:56.451
- to look after for the afternoon. 
- Good. That's called kidnapping.

36:56.651 --> 37:01.203
"Come on, Jackson, let's have a baby. I wanna be a mommy." I'm pathetic.

37:01.305 --> 37:02.451
You're not pathetic.

37:02.626 --> 37:06.501
I'm gonna be a bad mother. I should not be a parent.

37:06.629 --> 37:09.303
Sookie, look at me.

37:10.659 --> 37:13.307
There are many people in this world who should not have been parents.

37:13.567 --> 37:15.554
Mr. and Mrs. Hitler, for example.

37:16.501 --> 37:18.615
The bin Ladens could have just watched TV that night.

37:19.327 --> 37:21.821
Richard and Emily might have taken a pass at procreating.

37:22.061 --> 37:23.694
But you...

37:24.914 --> 37:27.217
no way. You're gonna be a great parent.

37:27.950 --> 37:29.608
- Yeah? 
- Yeah.

37:30.315 --> 37:30.909
How do you know?

37:31.493 --> 37:35.235
Because I know you, and I watched you with Rory when she was growing up.

37:35.369 --> 37:37.094
Well, who could not like Rory?

37:37.477 --> 37:40.689
You're gonna be amazing. That little boy of yours is very lucky.

37:41.287 --> 37:41.896
Okay.

37:43.213 --> 37:44.928
- I guess it's gonna be okay. 
- Yeah.

37:45.901 --> 37:47.953
Okay. Okay.

37:49.001 --> 37:51.742
- I'm really, really okay. 
- Yeah, okay.

37:58.460 --> 38:00.539
- Someone threw up on the table. 
- Oh, God.

38:01.039 --> 38:05.203
I'm okay. I'm just gonna go over there and be... okay.

38:05.304 --> 38:06.058
Good idea.

38:44.852 --> 38:47.741
- I'm on the floor. 
- You were sleeping.

38:48.309 --> 38:51.182
- I have no clothes on. 
- No, you don't.

38:51.473 --> 38:54.069
I'm on the floor, I have no clothes on,

38:54.806 --> 38:57.203
and you're a girl, so I must be...

38:57.309 --> 38:58.968
- On the wrong floor. 
- Oh, boy.

38:59.322 --> 39:01.268
- Where's your room? 
- I think up.

39:01.652 --> 39:03.219
- Are we on the first floor? 
- Yes.

39:03.372 --> 39:05.486
Then up. Any idea how long I've been here?

39:05.773 --> 39:09.460
So you have no idea how many people have walked by while I've...

39:09.643 --> 39:10.986
- Sorry. 
- Great.

39:11.778 --> 39:15.292
Now for the rest of my time at Yale, I'm gonna be "the naked guy."

39:15.593 --> 39:16.219
I'm sorry.

39:16.529 --> 39:17.621
And you know what's really great?

39:17.846 --> 39:22.045
Tomorrow, when the "naked guy" nickname starts spreading around campus like wildfire,

39:22.302 --> 39:24.631
I'm gonna be in my third hour of throwing up.

39:24.794 --> 39:26.678
It's been really quiet out here for a while now,

39:26.791 --> 39:29.607
so there's a chance that no one but me has actually seen you yet.

39:29.802 --> 39:31.625
- Oh yeah? 
- I promise I won't say anything.

39:32.561 --> 39:34.846
And if there's a chance that you could refrain from,

39:35.004 --> 39:37.517
you know, being naked again in the wrong hallway at the next party,

39:37.620 --> 39:40.143
then there's a chance you might get a completely different nickname,

39:40.282 --> 39:42.309
like "the never-naked guy."

39:43.369 --> 39:44.706
You're a very kind person.

39:44.859 --> 39:45.955
Wait. Hold on.

39:46.436 --> 39:47.794
You can borrow this.

39:50.949 --> 39:52.155
Thanks.

39:55.057 --> 39:57.238
Hey, weren't you in my Japanese Fiction class today?

39:57.640 --> 39:58.878
Yeah, that's right.

39:59.323 --> 40:00.071
I thought so.

40:00.967 --> 40:03.783
Hi, I'm... Marty.

40:05.187 --> 40:06.420
Rory.

40:06.743 --> 40:09.252
- I won't remember that tomorrow. 
- That's perfectly understandable.

40:09.344 --> 40:11.192
So I should probably try and find my room.

40:11.499 --> 40:14.238
And my pants, 'cause that's where I kept my keys.

40:14.484 --> 40:17.489
- So pants first. 
- Right, pants first.

40:18.387 --> 40:19.471
Night.

40:21.447 --> 40:23.209
I'm officially stupider than my brother.

40:24.392 --> 40:25.586
I never thought that would happen.

40:34.396 --> 40:36.402
I decided I'm going to do it.

40:37.049 --> 40:37.790
To do what?

40:38.360 --> 40:40.236
I'm going to go in there and I'm going to tell Grandma

40:40.392 --> 40:41.825
that she's going to butt out of my life.

40:42.749 --> 40:44.283
- Can I... 
- What are you doing?

40:44.744 --> 40:47.974
Just checking. So you have soberly decided to confront my mother?

40:48.168 --> 40:49.931
Are you sure you want to do this?

40:50.408 --> 40:53.044
All right, then I support you one hundred percent.

40:53.177 --> 40:53.807
Thank you.

40:53.939 --> 40:55.025
Just make sure you wait for the right moment.

40:55.215 --> 40:56.341
Oh, the right moment is now.

40:56.546 --> 41:00.150
The right moment arrived in a big pink hat full of feathers screaming,

41:00.447 --> 41:01.814
"Notice me because I am here!"

41:02.115 --> 41:03.949
Oh, well, if it was wearing a hat...

41:09.787 --> 41:11.075
- There they are. 
- Hi, Mom.

41:11.311 --> 41:11.905
Come in.

41:12.571 --> 41:15.137
I tell you, this day has been an absolute circus.

41:15.356 --> 41:18.100
I misplaced every single thing I needed -

41:18.351 --> 41:22.068
my grocery list, my ticket for the shoe repair. It was a nightmare.

41:22.258 --> 41:24.783
- What will you girls have? 
- Wait for the moment, wait for the moment.

41:25.615 --> 41:27.706
Grandma, I have to talk to you about something.

41:28.449 --> 41:29.636
Yes, Rory, what is it?

41:33.819 --> 41:35.109
I have an announcement.

41:35.625 --> 41:38.381
I am going into business with Jason Stiles.

41:39.435 --> 41:40.106
Who?

41:40.691 --> 41:42.472
You've met him - the Stiles boy.

41:42.702 --> 41:43.851
Oh, Digger.

41:44.433 --> 41:46.200
Nobody's called him Digger in years, Lorelai.

41:46.481 --> 41:47.772
And yes, I just got off the phone.

41:48.059 --> 41:50.470
We're going to get together later and hash out the details.

41:50.654 --> 41:52.267
Richard, that is wonderful.

41:52.400 --> 41:53.819
I didn't know you were looking for a partner.

41:53.968 --> 41:55.605
He wasn't. Jason came to him.

41:55.856 --> 41:58.847
That's right. He said he wanted to strike out on his own,

41:58.975 --> 42:00.341
he wanted to work with the best,

42:00.547 --> 42:02.794
and he wanted to screw over his father.

42:02.947 --> 42:05.067
- What? 
- Oh, excuse me, Rory.

42:05.246 --> 42:06.460
You never told me about this.

42:06.603 --> 42:08.825
Well, I was a bit surprised at the beginning,

42:09.025 --> 42:12.486
but I have to admit that when he told me that part of his motive was revenge,

42:12.594 --> 42:15.092
I was intrigued. No, I was tickled.

42:15.363 --> 42:18.717
I thought it was wonderful. What a wonderful world we live in

42:18.884 --> 42:23.094
that the son of my enemy hates his father and that I benefit from it all.

42:23.325 --> 42:25.071
It's downright Elizabethan.

42:25.952 --> 42:27.641
I don't think this is very funny, Richard.

42:27.796 --> 42:31.932
No, no, I suppose not. However, I can't stop smiling.

42:32.203 --> 42:34.205
I don't think you should go into business with this boy.

42:34.318 --> 42:37.190
- Oh, now, Emily. 
- He's obviously very troubled.

42:37.313 --> 42:40.129
You certainly don't need to hand over your business to a troubled youth.

42:40.242 --> 42:43.120
- He's 37 years old. 
- Yes, he's 37 years old,

42:43.222 --> 42:45.256
and all he can think about is how to get back at his father.

42:45.331 --> 42:48.542
- I don't understand that kind of thinking. 
- You know Floyd - he's horrible.

42:48.659 --> 42:52.688
He is the boy's father. He raised him. He clothed him. He fed him.

42:52.811 --> 42:57.061
He does not deserve to be paid back for all of his love and devotion like this.

42:57.158 --> 42:59.646
- Why are you getting so upset? 
- I don't want to talk about it anymore.

42:59.755 --> 43:01.244
Oh, Emily, be reasonable.

43:01.372 --> 43:02.960
I never liked that Digger in the first place.

43:03.083 --> 43:04.649
Oh, Emily, come back here.

43:09.800 --> 43:11.479
It wasn't the right moment.

43:15.488 --> 43:17.213
I was about to when Grandpa came in.

43:17.351 --> 43:19.441
He interrupted, and now Grandma's mad,

43:19.574 --> 43:22.231
so I'm sorry if it seems to you like I chickened out, but I didn't,

43:22.324 --> 43:23.947
and now it's just gonna have to wait.
