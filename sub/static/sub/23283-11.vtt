00:10.959 --> 00:12.000
- Hey, guys.

00:12.041 --> 00:13.917
We've got some pretty

00:12.041 --> 00:13.917
exciting news.

00:13.959 --> 00:15.750
We want you to meet

00:13.959 --> 00:15.750
the foreign exchange student

00:15.792 --> 00:17.750
from Australia

00:15.792 --> 00:17.750
who just moved in with us.

00:17.792 --> 00:19.083
- Hey.

00:19.125 --> 00:20.667
- G'day.

00:19.125 --> 00:20.667
Nice to meet you all.

00:20.709 --> 00:21.709
I'm Britt.

00:21.750 --> 00:24.125
- You talk funny.

00:24.166 --> 00:25.542
- What did you say?

00:25.583 --> 00:26.917
- You'll get used to it.

00:27.959 --> 00:29.583
I'm Mae.

00:27.959 --> 00:29.583
- And I'm Miles.

00:29.625 --> 00:32.041
- I'm Dooley.

00:29.625 --> 00:32.041
- I'm very excited to be here.

00:32.083 --> 00:33.500
It's gonna be ripper.

00:33.542 --> 00:36.583
- Absolutely.

00:33.542 --> 00:36.583
Totally ripper.

00:36.625 --> 00:38.709
What's ripper?

00:38.750 --> 00:40.083
- It means really great.

00:40.125 --> 00:42.125
As in,

00:40.125 --> 00:42.125
"Since I'm an only child,

00:42.166 --> 00:44.542
it's gonna be ripper to finally

00:42.166 --> 00:44.542
have a sister and brothers."

00:44.583 --> 00:46.375
[together]

00:44.583 --> 00:46.375
Ripper.

00:46.417 --> 00:49.041
- Yeah, by the way,

00:46.417 --> 00:49.041
where's Dicky?

00:49.083 --> 00:51.542
- Oh he's probably still

00:49.083 --> 00:51.542
watching the toilet flush.

00:51.583 --> 00:52.875
- Ew.

00:52.917 --> 00:54.500
- Oh, no,

00:52.917 --> 00:54.500
it's not what you think.

00:54.542 --> 00:56.375
Ever since Britt told him

00:54.542 --> 00:56.375
Australian toilets

00:56.417 --> 00:59.125
flush the opposite way,

00:56.417 --> 00:59.125
Dicky's been in the bathroom

00:59.166 --> 01:01.417
trying to make the water

00:59.166 --> 01:01.417
spin backwards.

01:02.500 --> 01:04.458
- That makes sense.

01:02.500 --> 01:04.458
- Yeah, that sounds right.

01:04.500 --> 01:07.291
- Still ew.

01:07.333 --> 01:09.417
- Do a lot of Americans talk

01:07.333 --> 01:09.417
like that?

01:09.458 --> 01:11.667
- [whispering]

01:09.458 --> 01:11.667
No.

01:11.709 --> 01:13.458
- Come on, Britt,

01:11.709 --> 01:13.458
let us introduce you to

01:13.500 --> 01:15.542
some typical American sports

01:13.500 --> 01:15.542
and hobbies.

01:17.792 --> 01:20.458
- Ooh, check these out.

01:21.208 --> 01:23.000
- Is it okay to just open those

01:21.208 --> 01:23.000
like that?

01:23.041 --> 01:24.667
- [scoffs]

01:23.041 --> 01:24.667
Our parents own the store.

01:24.709 --> 01:25.917
- We can do whatever

01:24.709 --> 01:25.917
we want.

01:25.959 --> 01:28.125
- Our lives are just

01:25.959 --> 01:28.125
that ripper.

01:29.083 --> 01:30.917
- Oh, this is not gonna

01:29.083 --> 01:30.917
end well.

01:32.375 --> 01:37.291
- Okay.

01:32.375 --> 01:37.291
Britt, these are golf balls.

01:37.333 --> 01:39.917
- Yeah, we have

01:37.333 --> 01:39.917
the Australian Open.

01:39.959 --> 01:42.750
- Those are tennis balls.

01:42.792 --> 01:45.208
- There's an Australian Open

01:42.792 --> 01:45.208
for tennis too.

01:45.250 --> 01:47.583
- Well, I bet there's

01:45.250 --> 01:47.583
no open for...

01:47.625 --> 01:50.083
miniature hockey.

01:50.125 --> 01:51.709
- That's a boomerang.

01:51.750 --> 01:53.875
And there's a cup,

01:51.750 --> 01:53.875
not an open.

01:53.917 --> 01:55.041
- I knew that, Britt.

01:55.083 --> 01:57.834
It's American humor.

01:57.875 --> 01:59.875
- I bet you use those a lot

01:57.875 --> 01:59.875
back home.

01:59.917 --> 02:01.917
- Not really.

01:59.917 --> 02:01.917
It's just in the movies.

02:01.959 --> 02:04.000
- Oh, so you don't know

02:01.959 --> 02:04.000
how to use it?

02:04.041 --> 02:05.709
- Of course I know

02:04.041 --> 02:05.709
how to use it.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.208
I'm Australian.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.208
Don't you watch movies?

02:09.375 --> 02:11.083
- Well, can you show us

02:09.375 --> 02:11.083
how to throw it?

02:11.125 --> 02:14.583
- Absolutely.

02:11.125 --> 02:14.583
But it's best to do it outside.

02:14.625 --> 02:17.667
- Again, Britt--

02:14.625 --> 02:17.667
parents own the store.

02:17.709 --> 02:19.583
- Yeah, so go ahead.

02:19.625 --> 02:21.959
You can boom your rang in here.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.750
- I wouldn't say it like that

02:22.000 --> 02:24.750
in Australia,

02:24.792 --> 02:26.875

02:37.083 --> 02:39.625

02:52.291 --> 02:54.083

02:52.291 --> 02:54.083
This isn't a "crikey."

02:54.125 --> 02:55.750
- Crikey or no crikey,

02:55.792 --> 02:58.333
you guys really

02:55.792 --> 02:58.333
boomed that rang.

02:58.375 --> 03:00.125
- I don't think

02:58.375 --> 03:00.125
you're saying it right.

03:00.166 --> 03:02.583
- Nobody is saying

03:00.166 --> 03:02.583
any of it right.

03:03.625 --> 03:04.709
- [gasps]

03:03.625 --> 03:04.709
- Kids?

03:04.750 --> 03:06.917
- What did you do?

03:06.959 --> 03:09.000
You know we have the special

03:06.959 --> 03:09.000
release of Isaiah Thomas'

03:09.041 --> 03:10.792
new Isaiah T-4 sneakers

03:09.041 --> 03:10.792
tomorrow.

03:10.834 --> 03:12.041
- Yeah.

03:10.834 --> 03:12.041
- We're psyched.

03:12.083 --> 03:13.291
- I can't wait to put my feet

03:13.333 --> 03:14.875
in those babies.

03:14.917 --> 03:17.208
- Then why would you trash

03:14.917 --> 03:17.208
the store?

03:17.250 --> 03:19.500
We just found out

03:17.250 --> 03:19.500
that Isaiah Thomas himself

03:19.542 --> 03:21.250
is gonna be here signing shoes.

03:21.291 --> 03:23.166
[all exclaiming]

03:23.208 --> 03:25.959
- And since the promotional

03:23.208 --> 03:25.959
price is only $4 a pair,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.375
there's gonna be

03:26.000 --> 03:28.375
a ton of people here to see...

03:28.417 --> 03:30.166
this!

03:31.709 --> 03:32.875
- Okay, you know what?

03:32.917 --> 03:34.041
We are so tired of you guys

03:34.083 --> 03:35.625
acting so entitled

03:34.083 --> 03:35.625
around here,

03:35.667 --> 03:37.834
so if you want Isaiah T-4s,

03:37.875 --> 03:39.750
you are gonna have to wait

03:37.875 --> 03:39.750
in line outside

03:39.792 --> 03:41.250
and pay for them

03:39.792 --> 03:41.250
like everyone else.

03:41.291 --> 03:43.959
- Told you it wasn't gonna

03:41.291 --> 03:43.959
end well.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.750
- And you better plan

03:44.000 --> 03:45.750
on getting up early,

03:45.792 --> 03:48.000
because there's only

03:45.792 --> 03:48.000
104 pair of those 4s.

03:48.041 --> 03:49.834
- Did you say,

03:48.041 --> 03:49.834
"Wait in line"?

03:49.875 --> 03:51.542
- "Outside"?

03:49.875 --> 03:51.542
- "Like everyone else"?

03:51.583 --> 03:53.500
What do you mean?

03:53.542 --> 03:55.875
- I think she means you guys

03:53.542 --> 03:55.875
are gonna have to wait in line,

03:55.917 --> 03:59.083
outside, like everyone else.

03:59.125 --> 04:01.291
- Thanks, Britt,

03:59.125 --> 04:01.291
but we've got this.

04:01.333 --> 04:03.458
See, there's no language

04:01.333 --> 04:03.458
barrier between us

04:03.500 --> 04:05.208
and our parents,

04:03.500 --> 04:05.208
and they would never expect us

04:05.250 --> 04:06.875
to wait in line.

04:06.917 --> 04:08.917
- Actually, that's exactly

04:06.917 --> 04:08.917
what we expect.

04:48.291 --> 04:50.500
as American.

this is gonna work?

- Yep.

our only question.

06:22.917 --> 06:24.458
while these dummies

06:22.917 --> 06:24.458
hold our spots

06:24.500 --> 06:25.875
at the front of the line.

06:29.917 --> 06:32.542
Where are our dummies?

06:32.583 --> 06:34.875
- Guess somebody thought

06:32.583 --> 06:34.875
our mannequin plan was garbage.

06:34.917 --> 06:36.166
- Why would you say that?

06:36.208 --> 06:39.041
- Because our mannequins

06:36.208 --> 06:39.041
are in the garbage.

06:41.208 --> 06:44.041
- Okay, new plan.

06:41.208 --> 06:44.041
There's Mae and Miles.

06:44.083 --> 06:45.291
They'll let us cut

06:44.083 --> 06:45.291
in front of them.

06:48.250 --> 06:50.250
Hey, guys.

06:50.291 --> 06:52.417
- G'day.

06:52.458 --> 06:56.125
- Listen, we kind of

06:52.458 --> 06:56.125
overslept this morning--

06:56.166 --> 06:58.750
- You mean you used mannequins

06:56.166 --> 06:58.750
to hold your spot

06:58.792 --> 07:00.166
at the front of the line?

07:00.208 --> 07:02.333
- I suppose that's possible.

07:02.375 --> 07:04.083
- And people got mad,

07:02.375 --> 07:04.083
tore 'em apart,

07:04.125 --> 07:05.667
and threw 'em

07:04.125 --> 07:05.667
into the dumpster?

07:05.709 --> 07:07.792
- Also possible.

07:07.834 --> 07:10.458
- There's a dumpster full

07:07.834 --> 07:10.458
of mannequins right over there.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.583
- Well, you can't prove we had

07:10.500 --> 07:12.583
anything to do with it.

07:12.625 --> 07:15.291
- They have nametags.

07:15.333 --> 07:17.125
- Are you gonna let us cut

07:15.333 --> 07:17.125
or not?

07:17.166 --> 07:19.709
- Please?

07:17.166 --> 07:19.709
It's just a little cut-sies.

07:19.750 --> 07:21.208
- No.

07:21.250 --> 07:23.375
And don't try to make it

07:21.250 --> 07:23.375
sound cute.

07:23.417 --> 07:25.625
- But it's just a little

07:23.417 --> 07:25.625
cut-sies.

07:25.667 --> 07:27.583
- All right, fine.

07:27.625 --> 07:29.166
- Miles!

07:27.625 --> 07:29.166
- What?

07:29.208 --> 07:31.250
It's just so charming

07:29.208 --> 07:31.250
when he says it.

07:32.583 --> 07:33.667
[whistle blows]

07:33.709 --> 07:34.667
- No cut-sies!

07:34.709 --> 07:35.750
all: Dooley?

07:35.792 --> 07:37.500
- What are you doing?

07:37.542 --> 07:39.250
- Your parents said

07:37.542 --> 07:39.250
they'd give me a free pair

07:39.291 --> 07:42.959
of signed Isaiah shoes

07:39.291 --> 07:42.959
if I kept the line in order.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.959
- Wait, so they punished us

07:45.000 --> 07:46.750
and then hired you

07:45.000 --> 07:46.750
to watch the line?

07:46.792 --> 07:48.709
- No, just to watch you.

07:48.750 --> 07:50.750
- So no cut-sies?

07:50.792 --> 07:52.875
- All right. But just you.

07:52.917 --> 07:54.959
all: Dooley!

07:52.917 --> 07:54.959
- Right!

07:55.000 --> 07:57.375
Back of the line,

07:55.000 --> 07:57.375
all of you.

07:57.417 --> 07:58.917
Sorry.

07:58.959 --> 08:01.333
- No worries.

08:01.375 --> 08:04.333
That means we get to spend

08:01.375 --> 08:04.333
more time together.

08:04.375 --> 08:07.834
Come on, Harpers.

08:04.375 --> 08:07.834
Let's hop on over there.

08:10.709 --> 08:12.959
- Look, I love that Britt

08:13.000 --> 08:14.291
never gets outraged

08:13.000 --> 08:14.291
by anything,

08:14.333 --> 08:16.333
but his lack of outrage

08:14.333 --> 08:16.333
is outraging me.

08:16.375 --> 08:19.834
- This is not shaping up

08:16.375 --> 08:19.834
to be such a g'day.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.500
- Come on, Harpers.

08:36.375 --> 08:38.667

08:36.375 --> 08:38.667
for the first three versions

08:38.709 --> 08:39.667
of Isaiah's shoes?

08:39.709 --> 08:40.959
- We don't know.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.250
We didn't have to wait in line.

08:43.291 --> 08:45.125
- I once waited three hours

08:45.166 --> 08:47.000
for a tiger pie

08:45.166 --> 08:47.000
in Woolloomooloo.

08:47.041 --> 08:50.000
It was ripper.

- Hey, what's the opposite

08:50.041 --> 08:51.792
of ripper?

08:51.834 --> 08:54.458
Because this is that.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.583
- This one's as feisty

08:54.500 --> 08:56.583
as a boxing kangaroo.

08:56.625 --> 09:00.333
- I should be insulted

08:56.625 --> 09:00.333
by that, but I'm charmed.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.667
- That accent lets you

09:01.458 --> 09:03.667
get away with anything.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.542

09:05.583 --> 09:07.834
- All right,

09:05.583 --> 09:07.834
let's give it a burl.

09:07.875 --> 09:09.166
Here's an easy one.

09:09.208 --> 09:12.208
Down under, we shave

09:09.208 --> 09:12.208

Repeat after me:

"rye-zuh blides."

- Zuh.

- Blides.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.500
all: Blides.

09:21.542 --> 09:22.709
- Now all together.

09:22.750 --> 09:23.959

09:25.125 --> 09:27.041
- Okay, we've got

09:25.125 --> 09:27.041

09:29.333 --> 09:32.208
- Hey, Dooley!

09:29.333 --> 09:32.208
Those people just cut.

09:32.250 --> 09:34.083
What's that all about?

09:32.250 --> 09:34.083
- No idea.

09:34.125 --> 09:36.041
Not here to watch them,

09:34.125 --> 09:36.041
just you.

09:36.083 --> 09:38.583
And you're terrible

09:36.083 --> 09:38.583
at accents.

09:42.667 --> 09:45.125
- You can't give us a ticket

09:42.667 --> 09:45.125
for being bad at accents.

09:45.166 --> 09:47.583
- Can. Did.

09:47.625 --> 09:50.792
Rye-zuh blides,

09:47.625 --> 09:50.792
rye-zuh blides...

09:50.834 --> 09:53.458
- Great. We just got bumped

09:50.834 --> 09:53.458
out of sneaker range.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.625
- And we have a court date

09:53.500 --> 09:55.625
in three weeks.

09:55.667 --> 09:58.834
- One problem at a time.

09:58.875 --> 10:00.834
Those people are out of line.

We need to get them

10:00.875 --> 10:03.792
out of line!

the plan-hatcher

10:14.875 --> 10:16.083
and you were the cook.

10:16.125 --> 10:18.375

10:16.125 --> 10:18.375
a plan, okay?

10:18.417 --> 10:20.208
And you're coming with me,

Hey, look, everybody!

10:31.250 --> 10:34.667
It's NBA superstar

10:31.250 --> 10:34.667
Isaiah Thomas!

10:34.709 --> 10:36.875
- [deep voice] Oh, no.

10:34.709 --> 10:36.875
I've been spotted.

10:36.917 --> 10:39.208
Back down the alley I go.

10:44.875 --> 10:46.625
- Yes!

10:44.875 --> 10:46.625
- Nice!

10:46.667 --> 10:48.625
- Looks like we're back

10:46.667 --> 10:48.625
in shoe-gettin' range.

10:48.667 --> 10:51.458
- We did it! We've won!

10:48.667 --> 10:51.458
- Hold on.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.417
This is the part

10:51.500 --> 10:53.417
where it looks like we've won,

10:53.458 --> 10:54.917
but if we're not careful,

10:54.959 --> 10:56.500
we'll get distracted

10:54.959 --> 10:56.500
by something.

10:56.542 --> 10:57.792
So stay focused.

11:10.375 --> 11:12.875
- Gladys, we have an

11:10.375 --> 11:12.875
Australian exchange student.

11:12.917 --> 11:15.208
- What does that have

11:12.917 --> 11:15.208
to do with tots?

11:15.250 --> 11:16.959
- Did you know

11:15.250 --> 11:16.959
that in Australia

11:17.000 --> 11:19.125
we call tater tots

11:17.000 --> 11:19.125

11:19.166 --> 11:21.792
- Oh, you don't say.

Hot gems!

11:21.834 --> 11:25.583
Get your hot potato gems!

Even though you're cute

11:27.375 --> 11:30.125

11:30.166 --> 11:31.625
- Fair enough.

11:31.667 --> 11:33.125
We'll take four orders

11:31.667 --> 11:33.125

11:35.291 --> 11:36.875
- $16?

11:36.917 --> 11:38.959
- They're organic.

- Hey, kids,

11:42.500 --> 11:43.875
Isaiah Thomas just arrived,

11:43.917 --> 11:45.500
so we'll be opening

11:43.917 --> 11:45.500
the doors shortly.

11:45.542 --> 11:46.875

11:45.542 --> 11:46.875
enough money

11:46.917 --> 11:48.458
for tots and shoes.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.875
- We barely had tot money.

11:50.917 --> 11:52.792
- Yeah, we thought our lesson

11:50.917 --> 11:52.792
was having to wait in line

11:52.834 --> 11:54.291
like everybody else.

11:54.333 --> 11:56.333
- We also said

11:54.333 --> 11:56.333
you had to buy them.

11:56.375 --> 11:58.625
- Yeah, but with your money,

11:56.375 --> 11:58.625
not ours.

11:58.667 --> 12:00.709
- Sorry, kids.

11:58.667 --> 12:00.709
No special treatment.

12:03.291 --> 12:04.875
- Hey, you were right.

12:04.917 --> 12:06.583
It did look like

12:04.917 --> 12:06.583

I'll just go home

12:12.083 --> 12:13.583
and get our money.

We'll all go together.
