Look, Meg, I'm that pretty
dark-haired figure skater

00:37.454 --> 00:38.664
with the horse teeth.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.332
You know, the one who got

00:40.415 --> 00:41.542
what she had coming.

00:41.625 --> 00:42.793
Nice figure eight, Mom.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.553
All right.

00:52.636 --> 00:55.305
Okay, Bonnie,
one two, three, push.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.390
( yelling )

01:03.105 --> 01:04.731
( cracking )

01:04.815 --> 01:06.275
My God, I can walk.

01:06.358 --> 01:07.693
It's a mira...!

01:08.694 --> 01:09.736
Sorry, Dad.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.697
Just get the chair.

01:13.532 --> 01:15.200
Good shot.

01:15.284 --> 01:17.953
Made my brown eye blue
with that one.

01:18.036 --> 01:19.663
Next one's coming
for your head.

01:19.830 --> 01:20.873
Oh, no.

01:20.956 --> 01:22.416
No, help!
Oh, help!

01:22.499 --> 01:24.209
What the hell?

01:24.293 --> 01:25.878
Now is the winter
of your discontent.

01:27.713 --> 01:29.464
Hey, Chris,
you want to race?

01:29.548 --> 01:31.341
On your mark,
get set, go.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.510
First one to the marker
where that Pakistani girl

01:33.594 --> 01:35.345
fell through the ice
after coming to the States

01:35.429 --> 01:37.306
to get treatment for her
severely burned face

01:37.389 --> 01:39.391
which she got when the man
she refused to marry

01:39.474 --> 01:40.726
dumped sulfuric acid
on her wins.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.477
I win.
Yes! Yes!

01:42.561 --> 01:45.230
In your face.
In your face!

01:45.314 --> 01:47.524
In my face.
In my face.

01:48.817 --> 01:49.860
( yells )

01:49.943 --> 01:51.069
Oh, no, Acid Girl!

01:51.153 --> 01:52.154
It's Acid Girl!

01:54.656 --> 01:57.659
( girls chanting ):
...James Woods High

01:57.743 --> 01:59.328
I am high on James Woods High.

01:59.411 --> 02:00.662
Hey, guys.

02:00.746 --> 02:01.872
What do you want, Meg?

02:01.955 --> 02:03.832
I'm here to try out
for cheerleading.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.667
Peter Rabbit
would be wise

02:05.751 --> 02:07.211
to stay out of
Mr. MacGregor's garden.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.962
Why don't you try
the flag girl squad?

02:15.135 --> 02:17.387
Are you trying out
for flag girl?

02:17.471 --> 02:19.556
( garbled )

02:25.229 --> 02:26.563
Yes! I win again, Andy.

02:26.647 --> 02:27.898
Come on, mate.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.942
One more before
the missus notices

02:30.025 --> 02:31.818
I'm not snoozing
on the couch.

02:31.902 --> 02:33.403
Too late.

02:36.740 --> 02:37.824
Hey, careful, Quagmire.

02:37.991 --> 02:38.992
Don't get too close

02:39.076 --> 02:40.452
to that thing.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.496
What the hell.

02:42.579 --> 02:43.872
Did I just get laid?

02:43.997 --> 02:44.998
Nice game, Peter.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.124
Yeah, I'm on a roll.

02:46.208 --> 02:48.168
I whipped Chris
on the ice today, too.

02:48.252 --> 02:49.837
Enjoy it while it lasts.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.756
It's only a matter of time
before he beats you.

02:52.840 --> 02:53.882
What are you talking about?

02:53.966 --> 02:55.592
I'm better than him
at everything.

02:55.676 --> 02:56.969
You name it--
sports, video games

02:57.052 --> 02:58.053
even magic tricks.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.390
Ha, ha, got your nose.

03:01.473 --> 03:02.558
Oh, yeah?

03:02.641 --> 03:04.142
Well, I got your face.

03:04.226 --> 03:06.478
( screaming )

03:07.563 --> 03:08.814
Calm down, Chris.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.899
It's only a trick.

03:10.983 --> 03:12.609
Face it, Peter,
sooner or later

03:12.693 --> 03:14.653
you're going to have
to pass the torch.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.738
I remember the first time
Kevin beat me.

03:16.822 --> 03:18.282
I was so proud of him.

03:18.365 --> 03:21.076
I gave him a little congratulatory punch
in the arm...

03:21.159 --> 03:22.202
and then another

03:22.286 --> 03:24.162
and then everything
got a little hazy.

03:24.246 --> 03:26.498
Kevin went to live with
a foster family for a while.

03:26.582 --> 03:27.791
Anyway, it's inevitable.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.168
Oh, don't feel bad, Joe.

03:29.251 --> 03:31.545
I think I know why
your son beat you.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.548
Apparently, you're a 12-year-old
prepubescent girl.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.425
Which is good

03:36.508 --> 03:38.969
'cause I finally have someone to give this
training bra to.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.262
Here you go, Josephina.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.806
Does that feel good on
your new budding bosoms?

03:42.890 --> 03:44.892
( high-pitched voice ):
It sure does, Mr...

03:44.975 --> 03:46.101
Get the hell off of me!

03:48.353 --> 03:50.397
Well, Rudolph, we finally
figured out

03:50.480 --> 03:51.982
what makes
your nose red.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.568
Is it pixie dust,
or leprechaun tails?

03:54.651 --> 03:55.736
No, it's a tumor.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.863
You mean like a magical
Christmas tumor?

03:57.946 --> 03:59.489
No, a malignant tumor--

03:59.573 --> 04:02.409
the base of which is lodged
deep within your brain.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.077
Oh.

04:04.161 --> 04:05.871
Like a happy, special...

04:05.954 --> 04:07.706
You're going to die.

04:08.123 --> 04:10.667
Hey, everybody,
guess what I am.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.420
The end result of a drunken
backseat grope-fest

04:13.504 --> 04:14.922
and a broken prophylactic?

04:15.005 --> 04:17.174
I'm on the flag girl squad.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.384
Oh, honey,
congratulations.

04:19.468 --> 04:21.553
Hey, Chris, I bet
you can't do this.

04:21.637 --> 04:23.847
I bet I can.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.058
We perform at all
the football games.

04:26.141 --> 04:27.809
I'm practically
a cheerleader.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.102
Oh, Meg,
that's wonderful.

04:29.186 --> 04:30.854
Isn't that
wonderful, Peter?

04:30.938 --> 04:32.231
Yeah. Way to go, Stewie.

04:32.314 --> 04:33.899
All right, Chris,
I'll see you a fork

04:33.982 --> 04:35.317
and raise you
a gravy ladle.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.735
You're on.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.237
So, you're
a flag girl.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.404
That's great, Meg.

04:39.488 --> 04:41.031
Yes, yes.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.991
Now you can be
somewhere else

04:43.075 --> 04:44.660
when the boys
don't call.

04:44.743 --> 04:47.829
( snickering )

04:47.913 --> 04:49.873
All right, saltshaker
up the nose.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.959
I've got pepper.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.418
( loud sneeze )

04:53.502 --> 04:54.586
( laughing)

04:54.670 --> 04:56.421
Yes! I win!

04:56.505 --> 04:57.714
That was fun, Dad.

04:57.798 --> 04:58.799
I'm the man!

04:58.882 --> 05:00.968
Yeah! Yea...

05:01.051 --> 05:04.429
Um, Lois, go get
the medical dictionary

05:04.513 --> 05:07.140
and look up
fork and lung.

05:07.224 --> 05:08.517
Why?

05:08.600 --> 05:09.601
Time's a factor, Lois.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.275
Say, Meg,
looking sharp.

05:16.358 --> 05:18.819
You want to go out
after the game tonight?

05:18.902 --> 05:20.279
Neal, I'm a flag girl now.

05:20.362 --> 05:22.489
I'm way too cool
to be seen with you.

05:22.573 --> 05:23.782
Really?

05:23.866 --> 05:27.494
Not even if I smoke
this corncob pipe?

05:35.627 --> 05:37.004
Hey, you guys.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.423
Are we all ready to cheer at the
game tonight?

05:39.506 --> 05:40.883
We?

05:40.966 --> 05:43.218
You made flag girl, huh?

05:43.302 --> 05:44.928
Yes. So this morning
my mom was all like

05:45.012 --> 05:46.346
"Meg, don't forget
your lunch."

05:46.430 --> 05:48.182
And I'm all like,
"Mom, I'm a flag girl now.

05:48.265 --> 05:49.558
I'm not going
to forget my lunch."

05:49.641 --> 05:51.143
And she's all like,
"Meg, don't forget

05:51.226 --> 05:52.644
your half-time routine
at the game."

05:52.728 --> 05:54.313
Moms.

05:54.438 --> 05:57.107
Hey, maybe we could all, like, hang out
after the game.

05:57.191 --> 05:58.567
Go, team!

06:00.068 --> 06:01.695
Uncool people
are like animals.

06:01.778 --> 06:04.615
You want to go feed the science club
after school?

06:09.036 --> 06:10.204
( whistle blowing )

06:14.499 --> 06:16.710
Look at me.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.795
Look at me.
I'm smoking.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.048
Dog, Dog, look.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.217
You know, alcohol doesn't
really make you warmer.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.511
In fact, it constricts
the blood vessels, causing...

06:25.594 --> 06:26.929
Shut up.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.847
The dog just told me
to shut up.

06:28.931 --> 06:31.475
I demand to know what
you plan to do about this.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.268
Hey, hey, the dog
just told me...

06:33.352 --> 06:34.937
Be quiet, Stewie.

06:37.356 --> 06:38.982
Freezing my nips
off out here.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.317
Oh, look, there's Meg.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.902
Meg.

06:41.985 --> 06:43.111
Meg!

06:43.529 --> 06:44.947
Meg!

06:45.030 --> 06:46.907
Meg!

06:48.033 --> 06:49.201
Hi, there.

06:49.284 --> 06:50.285
Hi, Meg.

06:50.369 --> 06:51.828
Here we go.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.748
( marching band playing
"Electric Avenue" )

07:04.842 --> 07:06.134
Peter, isn't she beautiful?

07:06.218 --> 07:07.928
Yeah, but I think
she's with that guy.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.680
They've been holding
hands all night.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.473
I mean Meg.

07:11.557 --> 07:12.850
Oh, oh, yeah.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.351
Yeah, she's hot.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.313
Aw, this meat stinks
something fierce.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.983
This ought to knock her
down a couple notches.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.073
( crowd gasping )

07:28.156 --> 07:31.201
( all laughing )

07:31.285 --> 07:32.661
Yay, Meg.

07:32.744 --> 07:35.956
I love how these kids
celebrate these days.

07:39.168 --> 07:40.210
What do you got?

07:40.294 --> 07:41.587
What do you got, huh?

07:41.670 --> 07:43.046
Come on.

07:44.548 --> 07:46.300
Come on, ref.
That's charging.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.260
Your feet were
moving. No foul.

07:48.343 --> 07:49.386
No foul?

07:49.469 --> 07:50.721
There's a stupid call.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.764
And I know something
about stupid calls.

07:52.848 --> 07:54.474
( phone ringing )

07:54.558 --> 07:55.976
Hello.

07:56.059 --> 07:58.020
Peter: Lois, I can't take out
the garbage

07:58.103 --> 08:01.273
because I'm at the office
and they're making me stay late.

08:01.356 --> 08:03.483
Peter, the caller ID says
you're calling from the kitchen.

08:03.609 --> 08:05.569
In fact, I can see you.

08:05.736 --> 08:06.778
Can you see me now?

08:06.862 --> 08:07.863
No.

08:07.946 --> 08:09.198
Okay, now
I'm at the office.

08:09.531 --> 08:11.491
The score's tied.
Next basket wins.

08:11.575 --> 08:13.285
Chris, you might finally
beat your old man.

08:13.368 --> 08:14.953
What are you talking
about "old man"?

08:15.037 --> 08:16.330
I'm the white Larry Bird.

08:16.413 --> 08:17.497
What do you got?

08:17.581 --> 08:19.625
What do you got, huh?
Come on.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.627
Your mother and I
are getting a divorce.

08:21.710 --> 08:22.711
You are?

08:23.504 --> 08:24.546
Yes! Yes!

08:24.630 --> 08:26.715
Oh, no, we worked it out.

08:26.798 --> 08:27.883
Yes!

08:27.966 --> 08:29.551
Well, son, you played good

08:29.635 --> 08:31.762
but your dad is
still number one.

08:31.845 --> 08:35.057
Yeah, I don't think
I'll ever beat you.

08:35.140 --> 08:37.726
Hey, Chris, what's
with your leg?

08:37.809 --> 08:38.977
Oh, my God!

08:39.061 --> 08:40.103
That's not your leg!

08:46.902 --> 08:49.029
( Peter groaning )

08:49.112 --> 08:50.280
What's wrong, honey?

08:50.364 --> 08:51.573
I'll tell you
what's wrong.

08:51.740 --> 08:52.908
I'm trying to make
love to you

08:52.991 --> 08:54.576
and you're thinking
about Chris.

08:54.660 --> 08:56.161
Peter, is there something
you need to tell me?

08:56.245 --> 08:58.705
Thanks to you, our son
has a huge wang.

08:58.789 --> 08:59.998
Thanks to me?

09:00.082 --> 09:01.917
Well, he didn't
get it from me.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.252
What are you
talking about?

09:03.335 --> 09:04.378
I'll show you.

09:07.297 --> 09:08.882
All right, stand back, Lois.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.759
Oh, my.

09:10.843 --> 09:12.511
Well, no wonder
he's always slouching.

09:12.594 --> 09:13.762
How the hell
did this happen?

09:13.846 --> 09:15.639
I'm supposed to be
the man of the house.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.182
You must be
so ashamed of me.

09:17.266 --> 09:20.185
Oh, Peter, I care as much about the
size of your penis

09:20.269 --> 09:22.396
as you care about
the size of my breasts.

09:22.479 --> 09:23.856
Oh, my God!

09:27.818 --> 09:30.195
Meg, honey, you can't let those awful kids
get to you.

09:30.279 --> 09:31.446
Oh, they won't.

09:31.530 --> 09:32.614
Because I'm never
going back

09:32.698 --> 09:33.740
to that school again.

09:34.283 --> 09:35.450
Dad, after dinner

09:35.534 --> 09:37.411
could you help me
with my algebra?

09:37.494 --> 09:38.745
Hey, you're
a big man.

09:38.829 --> 09:39.872
You figure it out.

09:39.955 --> 09:41.415
You know, I bet
there's a part of you

09:41.498 --> 09:43.292
that really wants
to be friends with them.

09:43.375 --> 09:44.626
Maybe.

09:44.710 --> 09:45.961
So, be nice to them.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.297
Win your enemies over
with unflappable kindness.

09:48.380 --> 09:49.590
Chris, drink
your milk.

09:49.673 --> 09:51.133
It'll make you
big and strong.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.718
No! No more milk
for him, Lois!

09:52.801 --> 09:53.802
He's had enough!

09:53.886 --> 09:55.470
Give me that.

09:55.554 --> 09:58.098
Meghan, you must
try the brisket.

09:58.182 --> 09:59.683
Allow me to serve it
in the manner

09:59.766 --> 10:00.976
to which you're accustomed.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.605
Come talk to me sometime,
sweetheart.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.940
I know what it takes
to be cool.

10:09.318 --> 10:12.321
She packed my bags...

10:12.404 --> 10:14.698
last night-- preflight.

10:16.950 --> 10:20.078
Zero hour-- 9:00 a.m.

10:23.665 --> 10:27.169
And I'm gonna be high...

10:31.256 --> 10:34.676
as a kite by then.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.833
Oh, God,
it's her.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.835
Look, about
the other night...

11:49.918 --> 11:51.211
Oh, that was
hilarious.

11:51.295 --> 11:53.714
I just wish I'd
known ahead of time.

11:53.797 --> 11:55.340
I would have brought
potato salad.

11:55.424 --> 11:56.425
( laughs )

11:56.508 --> 11:57.509
( chuckles)

11:57.759 --> 12:00.304
Hey, you guys want
tomorrow's Biology test?

12:00.387 --> 12:02.055
Whoa! How'd
you get that?

12:02.139 --> 12:03.724
I spent the night
with Mr. Burler.

12:09.730 --> 12:10.772
Ah, the sun's up.

12:10.856 --> 12:12.399
I'm safe for
another night.

12:12.482 --> 12:13.775
Thanks, Meg.

12:13.859 --> 12:15.527
Wow. Thanks.

12:15.611 --> 12:16.695
See ya.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.322
That was kind of cool.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.406
Yeah.

12:19.489 --> 12:20.949
I'm bored.

12:21.033 --> 12:22.534
Hey, you want to go
push the janitor

12:22.618 --> 12:24.161
knowing he can't
legally push us back?

12:24.244 --> 12:25.245
Sure.

12:25.329 --> 12:26.538
Awesome.

12:26.622 --> 12:27.623
Okay, cool.

12:29.750 --> 12:32.336
Hey, Dad, look at
these little bananas.

12:32.628 --> 12:33.754
( laughs )

12:33.837 --> 12:35.923
Why, you smug
little bastard.

12:36.006 --> 12:37.132
Peter!

12:37.216 --> 12:39.134
Chris, these
are plantains

12:39.218 --> 12:42.137
and there's nothing
wrong with them.

12:42.221 --> 12:44.389
In fact, a lot of women
prefer them

12:44.473 --> 12:48.143
to normal-sized bananas
because they're exotic

12:48.227 --> 12:50.979
and flavorful
and very, very special.

12:51.063 --> 12:53.357
Oh, yeah, sure, Lois,
all the sorority girls

12:53.440 --> 12:55.484
are clamoring for
the plantain section.

12:55.567 --> 12:56.902
Stop with this.

12:56.985 --> 12:59.613
Look, Peter, you're overreacting
to this Chris stuff.

12:59.696 --> 13:02.032
I mean, mine goes inside
of me when I stand up.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.408
How do you think I feel?

13:03.492 --> 13:04.535
Is Dad mad at me?

13:04.618 --> 13:05.869
Oh, of course
not, honey.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.579
Now go pick out
a box of cereal

13:07.663 --> 13:09.915
and meet me
at the ten-inches-or-less line.

13:09.998 --> 13:11.208
Items!

13:12.668 --> 13:14.461
Nice, huh?

13:14.545 --> 13:17.422
Yeah, you like this?

13:17.506 --> 13:18.841
Stop it, Peter.

13:18.924 --> 13:20.592
You're embarrassing me.

13:20.676 --> 13:22.845
Look, I know you're
upset, but...

13:22.928 --> 13:24.555
Oh, my God.
Where's Stewie?

13:24.638 --> 13:25.639
He's around.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.099
Stewie:
Let me out of this

13:27.182 --> 13:28.934
stink-filled
corduroy dungeon!

13:29.017 --> 13:30.227
Peter, that's sick!

13:30.310 --> 13:32.563
It's okay. He's outside
the underwear.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.567
Enjoy your new car,
Mr. Griffin.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.569
Thanks, Jim.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.821
( engine revving )

13:40.904 --> 13:43.991
( loud rock music playing )

13:47.202 --> 13:50.497
Hey, when you pull that
thing into your garage

13:50.581 --> 13:52.958
does the garage say,
"Is it in yet?"

13:53.041 --> 13:54.376
( laughs )

13:59.339 --> 14:00.591
Don't worry, baby.

14:00.674 --> 14:01.800
I'll be gentle.

14:09.057 --> 14:10.642
( loud crash )

14:11.518 --> 14:13.312
( all laughing)

14:17.566 --> 14:19.359
Ow, my pride.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.029
Mom, you were right!

14:22.112 --> 14:23.697
I was nice
to the cool kids

14:23.780 --> 14:25.157
and they didn't spit on me.

14:25.240 --> 14:28.035
Connie D'Amico even invited me
to her Sweet 16.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.453
Oh, how wonderful.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.622
Now, what time do we nail
those snot-nosed punks?

14:31.705 --> 14:33.248
"Nail them"?

14:33.332 --> 14:35.125
You told me to win them
over with kindness.

14:35.209 --> 14:38.003
Yes, and now that they think
you're their friend

14:38.086 --> 14:40.422
it's the perfect time
to exact your revenge.

14:40.506 --> 14:41.632
"Revenge"?

14:41.715 --> 14:43.884
See, Meg, I'm like
one of those bald eagles

14:43.967 --> 14:45.636
you see on
the Discovery Channel:

14:45.719 --> 14:46.803
beautiful to look at

14:46.887 --> 14:48.305
but mess with one of my chicks

14:48.388 --> 14:50.307
and I'll use
my razor-sharp talons

14:50.390 --> 14:52.059
to rip your ( timer dings )
eyes out.

14:52.142 --> 14:54.436
Cookies are done.
Who wants chocolate chip?

14:54.520 --> 14:55.521
Ooh, I do.

14:55.604 --> 14:57.064
But keep talking.

14:57.147 --> 15:00.317
All this stuff about eye-gouging
has got me all frisky.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.486
Really, I've got
about a half a pack

15:02.569 --> 15:03.737
of Rolaids in my diaper.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.120
I'm glad you're interested

15:12.204 --> 15:13.997
in joining the National Gun
Association, Peter.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.082
Let me show you around.

15:15.165 --> 15:16.834
This is
our shooting range.

15:28.053 --> 15:29.888
And here we have
our locker room

15:29.972 --> 15:31.431
with full shower
facilities.

15:31.515 --> 15:35.227
Holy crap, they're all so small.

15:35.310 --> 15:37.396
Well, you see, Peter,
the way we look at it

15:37.479 --> 15:39.606
a man's only as big
as the gun he carries.

15:39.690 --> 15:41.149
Sign me up, Jack

15:41.233 --> 15:43.151
and give me the biggest
freaking gun you got.

15:43.235 --> 15:44.778
Hey, Stewie,
you can come out now.

15:44.862 --> 15:46.363
Ah! Turn off the light.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.240
I'm reading a ghost story.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.745
Pull.

15:54.788 --> 15:55.831
Oh, yeah.

15:55.914 --> 15:58.458
Who's the big
man now, huh?

15:58.542 --> 15:59.918
Madonna or Janet Jackson?

16:00.002 --> 16:01.086
Which Janet Jackson?

16:01.170 --> 16:02.171
Velvet Rope.

16:02.254 --> 16:03.255
Yeah, that one.
Pull!

16:04.464 --> 16:05.632
Peter, what the hell
are you doing

16:05.716 --> 16:06.717
with that thing?

16:06.800 --> 16:07.926
You want to touch it?

16:08.010 --> 16:09.386
Go on. Got to be
careful, though.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.013
You don't want it
to get too excited

16:11.096 --> 16:12.264
and go off in your hair.

16:12.347 --> 16:13.348
This is pathetic.

16:13.432 --> 16:14.433
And all because

16:14.516 --> 16:15.642
you feel inadequate
next to Chris.

16:15.726 --> 16:16.727
Don't be stupid.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.228
I don't need to compete
with my son

16:18.312 --> 16:19.563
or his freakishly
large penis.

16:19.646 --> 16:20.647
I'm a freak.

16:20.731 --> 16:21.982
Don't despair.

16:22.065 --> 16:24.318
Let's just hang a tire
on the end of it

16:24.401 --> 16:26.695
and head on down
to the old swimming hole.

16:27.571 --> 16:29.740
Okay, listen up.

16:29.823 --> 16:32.201
Connie D'Amico's house
is two stories.

16:32.284 --> 16:35.162
Now, if we set up
booby traps here, here...

16:35.245 --> 16:37.289
How'd you get
these blueprints?

16:37.372 --> 16:39.249
Oh, your mother
has her ways.

16:39.333 --> 16:40.501
She has her ways.

16:40.584 --> 16:42.503
Can I have the blueprints
to the D'Amico house?

16:42.586 --> 16:43.587
Sure, here you go.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.256
Now, I've put together
a little flash bomb

16:46.340 --> 16:47.883
to create a diversion.

16:47.966 --> 16:50.761
I used to date the pyro guy
from Whitesnake.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.054
What's Whitesnake?

16:52.137 --> 16:55.349
That's the music mommies
and daddies listen to.

16:55.432 --> 16:56.517
Fire in the hole!

16:59.311 --> 17:00.938
Peter, some of the guys
from the club

17:01.021 --> 17:02.147
are going
hunting tomorrow.

17:02.231 --> 17:03.315
Count me in.

17:03.398 --> 17:04.608
Hunting?

17:04.691 --> 17:06.527
I thought you were going
to play hockey with Chris.

17:06.610 --> 17:07.819
Well, you can
bring him along.

17:07.903 --> 17:09.488
Oh, no, it's
too dangerous.

17:09.571 --> 17:13.617
Lois, Lois, the National Gun
Association is all about safety

17:13.700 --> 17:16.078
especially when
it comes to kids.

17:16.161 --> 17:17.621
Take a look
at our new video.

17:21.834 --> 17:23.460
Man:
Let's face it.

17:23.544 --> 17:24.837
Your kids are going
to get into your guns.

17:24.920 --> 17:25.921
That's a fact.

17:26.046 --> 17:27.631
Gun accidents can be avoided

17:27.714 --> 17:30.175
by introducing your children
to guns as early as possible.

17:30.259 --> 17:32.594
Hi, I'm Petey
the Pistol.

17:32.678 --> 17:34.763
Say, do you ever
get lonely?

17:34.847 --> 17:36.014
Yes.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.391
Me, too.

17:37.474 --> 17:38.767
Hold me.

17:38.851 --> 17:39.893
If you squeeze me

17:39.977 --> 17:41.562
I make bad people go away.

17:41.645 --> 17:42.896
But wait a minute.

17:42.980 --> 17:44.982
I though guns were bad.

17:45.065 --> 17:47.067
Announcer:
Guns are good.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.735
In fact, did you know that

17:48.819 --> 17:51.572
Jesus and Moses used guns
to conquer the Romans?

17:53.615 --> 17:55.826
So, remember, guns
don't kill people--

17:55.909 --> 17:57.619
dangerous minorities do.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.376
See, Lois, they're
responsible.

18:09.256 --> 18:10.883
Hey, check it
out, Chris.

18:10.966 --> 18:12.968
I can write my name
in the snow.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.430
This is fun, Dad.

18:16.513 --> 18:18.056
Son, son, I told you

18:18.140 --> 18:21.685
out here in the wilderness
call me Rooster Cogburn.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.187
You know, Rooster

18:23.270 --> 18:25.397
I was starting to think
you didn't like me anymore.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.024
Chris, look. Tracks.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.318
There must be a deer
around here.

18:29.401 --> 18:31.486
Those are snowmobile tracks.

18:31.570 --> 18:32.571
Shh, there he is.

18:36.325 --> 18:38.035
( gasps )

18:40.120 --> 18:41.121
Ah, such grace.

18:41.205 --> 18:42.956
That's the thing
about hunting.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.541
You got to be patient.

18:44.625 --> 18:45.626
( loud growl )

18:45.709 --> 18:46.919
What the hell
was that?

18:47.002 --> 18:48.170
( screams )

18:49.796 --> 18:52.549
( dance music playing )

18:56.887 --> 18:58.847
Here, put this in
the heating grate

18:58.931 --> 19:00.641
and set it off
in five minutes.

19:00.724 --> 19:01.725
I changed my mind.

19:01.808 --> 19:02.809
I'm not doing it.

19:02.893 --> 19:04.311
These people are
my friends now.

19:04.394 --> 19:05.771
After they pelted
you with meat?

19:05.854 --> 19:06.855
Did you forget how

19:06.939 --> 19:08.232
the neighbor kids
chased after you

19:08.315 --> 19:10.067
and tried to sprinkle
you with Fixin's?

19:10.150 --> 19:12.861
Yes, I did.

19:12.945 --> 19:17.074
Okay, now we're going to play
"Seven Minutes in Heaven"

19:17.157 --> 19:19.451
and it's my party
so I want Doug

19:19.535 --> 19:21.578
to go in the closet
with Meg.

19:23.956 --> 19:26.083
Have fun.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.418
( all giggling )

19:28.502 --> 19:30.754
Okay, everyone, get ready.

19:30.838 --> 19:32.673
Say hello to the lovers.

19:34.299 --> 19:35.384
( screams )

19:37.469 --> 19:40.389
I don't know who should
be more humiliated

19:40.472 --> 19:41.557
Meg or the pig?

19:41.640 --> 19:42.724
She's such a dork.

19:42.808 --> 19:44.560
I think I feel worse
for the pig.

19:44.643 --> 19:46.103
( pig squealing )

19:46.186 --> 19:47.563
Mom, you were right.

19:47.646 --> 19:49.940
I should have just
stuck to the plan.

19:50.023 --> 19:51.024
Well, I figured

19:51.108 --> 19:52.734
you might get
soft on me

19:52.818 --> 19:55.988
so I hired an old friend
to scar them for life.

19:56.071 --> 19:57.072
( doorbell rings )

19:57.155 --> 19:58.448
Hey, there, sweetie.

19:58.532 --> 19:59.533
How old are you?

19:59.616 --> 20:00.617
Sixteen.

20:00.701 --> 20:02.327
18? You're first.

20:02.411 --> 20:03.453
Mom?

20:03.537 --> 20:05.455
I like where
this is going.

20:05.539 --> 20:07.499
Giggety-giggety, giggety.

20:07.583 --> 20:08.876
Don't worry, Chris.

20:08.959 --> 20:10.169
I'll handle the bear.

20:10.252 --> 20:11.920
Say hello to Satan for me.

20:13.881 --> 20:15.799
( screams )

20:15.883 --> 20:17.926
It's a boy,
Mrs. Griffin.

20:18.010 --> 20:19.386
I'm afraid the fever

20:19.469 --> 20:21.471
has affected his motor skills,
Mrs. Griffin.

20:21.555 --> 20:23.223
Looks like he's going
to have to repeat

20:23.307 --> 20:24.308
the fourth grade,
Mrs. Griffin.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.476
Looks like he's going
to have to repeat

20:26.560 --> 20:28.145
the fourth grade,
Mrs. Griffin.

20:28.228 --> 20:29.771
The only way
to get rid of them

20:29.855 --> 20:32.816
is with this special shampoo
and a tiny comb, Mr. Griffin.

20:32.900 --> 20:35.819
Congratulations, you've passed
the fourth grade, Mr. Griffin.

20:35.903 --> 20:37.738
Oh, great. Listen, I got
to leave, though.

20:37.821 --> 20:39.031
I'm going hunting
with my son.

20:39.114 --> 20:41.033
Dad, I know what to do.

20:41.116 --> 20:43.952
I saw it on Fox's
When Bears Attack.

20:44.036 --> 20:46.413
Go away! Go on! Get!

20:46.496 --> 20:50.209
Stay tuned
for an all-new Ally McBeal.

20:50.292 --> 20:51.376
Holy crap.

20:51.460 --> 20:53.003
Chris, that
was amazing.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.671
I mean, I just
froze up

20:54.755 --> 20:56.965
but you handled that bear
like a real man.

20:57.049 --> 20:58.425
I'm proud of you, son.

20:58.509 --> 20:59.801
You are?

20:59.885 --> 21:01.553
'Cause I heard
what you said

21:01.637 --> 21:03.096
about my huge...
you know.

21:03.180 --> 21:04.681
Oh, oh, you...

21:04.765 --> 21:06.850
You heard that, huh?

21:06.934 --> 21:08.810
Well, I was just
being stupid.

21:08.894 --> 21:09.895
Take it from me

21:09.978 --> 21:12.314
that thing you got
there is a blessing.

21:12.397 --> 21:14.733
I mean, every guy
you see with a big house

21:14.816 --> 21:16.818
or a fancy car
or a shiny gold tooth

21:16.902 --> 21:19.530
is really just saying,
"Don't look at my penis"

21:19.613 --> 21:21.573
but you'll never have
to worry about that.

21:21.657 --> 21:22.658
Thanks, Dad.

21:22.741 --> 21:24.159
You're the best.

21:25.202 --> 21:28.372
You know, Dad,
I just realized something.

21:28.455 --> 21:29.790
Your name's Peter.

21:30.082 --> 21:31.333
( laughs )

21:31.416 --> 21:32.876
You're right. It is.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.378
( laughs )

21:34.461 --> 21:35.671
Peter.

21:35.754 --> 21:37.881
( both laugh )
