[Williams] This is it, Ray.

01:17.445 --> 01:18.777
You can't screw up again.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.815
I'm trying to help you, Ray.

01:22.817 --> 01:24.083
I really am.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.318
They're good people.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.756
Your, uh, Aunt Sherry
and cousin Kim.

Real family. Embrace it.

[soft piano music]

01:41.469 --> 01:42.534
Come in.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.206
Hi. Sherry? I'm Ernie Williams.

01:47.208 --> 01:49.475
Hi, how are you, Kim. Ray?

01:52.213 --> 01:54.113
[dramatic piano music]

03:16.964 --> 03:18.263
It's really good.

03:19.733 --> 03:23.402
Oh, I'm glad I got
the family size. [chuckles]

03:24.838 --> 03:25.871
Mom never cooks.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.307
Hey, hey, that's not true.

03:28.309 --> 03:29.374
[scoffs]

03:29.376 --> 03:30.642
I've made some stuff.

03:37.484 --> 03:38.717
This must be really hard.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.694
How many other homes were there?

03:48.696 --> 03:50.329
Kim.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.330
What?

03:51.966 --> 03:53.265
No, that's fine.

03:59.473 --> 04:02.975
Eight, nine, including here.

04:08.549 --> 04:11.717
I never really knew her,
your mom.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.493
[school bell rings]

04:24.298 --> 04:25.731
Yo, Mike.

04:25.733 --> 04:28.033
Sit next to me in physics,
I didn't study?

[chuckles]

04:30.838 --> 04:31.937
Hey, man.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.373
What's up, brother?

04:34.375 --> 04:36.508
-How you doing?
-Extraordinary.

04:36.510 --> 04:37.843
-And you?
-I'm alright, man.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.544
-[Kim] Hey.
-[all] Hey.

04:39.546 --> 04:41.013
How are you?

04:41.015 --> 04:42.881
-[Vic] Wow, let me get one.
-[Kim] So cute.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.950
-[Kim] Stop.
-[Vic laughs]

04:45.753 --> 04:48.287
-[Eric] What's up?
-Ray, this is Eric,
my boyfriend.

04:49.023 --> 04:52.024
-Zoe. Vic.
-[Vic] Yo.

04:52.026 --> 04:55.060
-[Kim chuckles]
-[Vic] You guys
look nothing alike.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.529
-[Zoe] Not at all.
-[Vic] Not a little bit.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.464
What's up, Ray?

05:00.901 --> 05:02.801
[school bell rings]

05:02.803 --> 05:05.404
-[Zoe] Hey, got to go.
-[Vic] Alright.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.973
-See you.
-[Vic] Let me grab my bag.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.675
-What?
-Got something.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.814
-What?
-I made this for you.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.383
You made this?

05:18.385 --> 05:20.452
Well, yeah, yeah.
I mean, it's nothing crazy.

05:20.454 --> 05:21.586
You like?

05:21.588 --> 05:23.989
I love it. Thank you.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.526
How about thanking me
in private?

05:28.395 --> 05:29.428
Eric.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.063
Kim.

05:31.065 --> 05:32.764
-[scoffs]
-What?

05:32.766 --> 05:34.066
I told you,
I don't want my first time

05:34.068 --> 05:35.600
to be a quickie
during lunch break.

05:35.602 --> 05:36.702
Well, then don't put
words in my mouth

05:36.704 --> 05:37.969
'cause that's not what I said.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.706
Let's just talk
about this later.

05:40.708 --> 05:41.840
Yeah.

05:46.613 --> 05:47.746
[Kim sighs] Let's go.

05:47.748 --> 05:51.450
[Vic sighs] Still ain't
knock it out of the park?

05:51.452 --> 05:52.984
Shut up, they're right there.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.754
Goddamn it, no, I haven't.

05:56.623 --> 05:59.491
I feel like this fucking Ray
thing is not going to help.

06:00.094 --> 06:01.093
Definitely not.

06:03.430 --> 06:05.564
They really don't look related.

06:05.566 --> 06:06.598
Told you.

06:07.634 --> 06:12.604
[Dwyer] Nature versus nurture.

06:14.808 --> 06:21.079
Was Richard Ramirez
born a killer?

06:21.081 --> 06:25.117
Or, was he exposed
to violence at an early age

06:25.119 --> 06:28.487
and that turned him
into the Night Stalker?

06:29.490 --> 06:32.023
I mean, a lot of people
suffer tragedy in their lives,

06:32.025 --> 06:34.059
but they don't go
on killing sprees.

06:35.562 --> 06:41.600
So... was there something
in Mr. Ramirez's DNA

06:41.602 --> 06:44.403
that made it so easy
for him to kill.

06:45.672 --> 06:46.938
I mean, we're not alone.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.694
All animals kill.

06:52.695 --> 06:54.712
But humans,
humans have the ability

06:54.715 --> 07:00.051
to check their animal
instincts... most of the time.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.122
Now, back to Mr. Ramirez.

07:04.124 --> 07:08.627
If he were an animal...
what would he be?

07:09.997 --> 07:12.130
Anyone? Come on.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.700
[eerie music]

07:21.175 --> 07:22.941
Great white?

07:22.943 --> 07:24.042
[Dwyer] Hmm.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.744
And why would a great white

07:25.746 --> 07:27.579
be like a serial killer?

07:29.650 --> 07:32.651
Well, uh, they're
solitary predators.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.720
They don't travel
in packs or anything.

07:36.723 --> 07:38.457
And they don't just
hunt for food.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.528
Ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding.

07:43.530 --> 07:44.696
Correct.

07:44.698 --> 07:45.697
Way to go, Ray.

07:47.468 --> 07:51.136
Class, this man comes in
on his first day, participates.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.005
Got a lot of catching up to do.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.644
[soft dramatic music]

08:00.514 --> 08:04.149
[Sherry] So, what are you
planning to do tonight?

08:04.151 --> 08:05.917
[Kim] Just a couple of us
are going to get together

08:05.919 --> 08:07.152
-and hang out.
-Mm-hmm.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.820
-[Kim] Nothing big.
-Okay.

08:08.822 --> 08:13.625
-[Kim] Why are you asking me?
-Well, I was just wondering
if you were thinking

08:13.627 --> 08:16.127
of inviting Ray,
bringing him along.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.232
[Kim] I don't think
that's a good idea, Mom.

08:21.235 --> 08:23.902
[Sherry] Well, he needs
to make some friends.

08:23.904 --> 08:26.538
[Kim] Yeah, but, Mom,
I don't think he'd get along

08:26.540 --> 08:28.073
with my friends very well.

08:28.075 --> 08:30.275
You could introduce him,
maybe he could make some friends

08:30.277 --> 08:32.711
and then he wouldn't
seem like a problem.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.832
-[Eric sighs]
-[Zoe] Wow, first time
you didn't crash.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.568
-[Eric] Oh, God, Zoe.
-[Vic] Can you shut
that please? Thanks.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.103
[Eric] You got to relax on me.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.071
Hey, Vic, will you check
for some hot Cheetos, man?

09:00.073 --> 09:01.673
-[Vic] Yeah.
-I got, like, a craving.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.174
-[Vic] Okay.
-Hey, Ray.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.243
Go up to the counter, ask for

09:05.245 --> 09:06.912
Lucky Duck
scratch tickets, okay?

09:06.914 --> 09:08.713
-What?
-Lucky Duck scratch ticket.

09:08.715 --> 09:09.981
It's a, it's a lottery thing.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.818
[bell dings]

09:21.695 --> 09:23.662
[ominous music]

09:23.664 --> 09:25.096
Sorry.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.932
[group chatter]

09:31.805 --> 09:33.672
[Eric] Seen any Cheetos, man?

09:33.674 --> 09:34.940
[Vic] Nah, no Cheetos.

09:38.779 --> 09:41.212
[Kim] You know what's really
good, though? This stuff.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.714
-Pineapple juice.
-Tastes good. Right?

09:42.716 --> 09:44.583
-Yes.
-I know, it tastes so good.

09:44.585 --> 09:47.686
-So does this.
It's, uh, kid approved.
-No, no, no.

09:47.688 --> 09:50.088
Hey, don't do anything stupid.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.057
You think I'm going
to do something?

09:52.059 --> 09:53.925
-Yes.
-This girl, who do you
think you're dating?

09:53.927 --> 09:55.694
[Kim] You always
do something stupid.

09:55.696 --> 09:58.063
I'm totally going to do
something stupid. [chuckles]

09:58.065 --> 10:00.231
Hey, Ray.
Ray, Ray, Ray. Hey, man.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.071
Lucky Duck, man, come on.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.652
-Yo, Cheetos?
-[Vic] No, no Cheetos.

10:20.654 --> 10:23.989
Damn, that's weird, man.
What kind of liquor store
doesn't have Cheetos?

10:23.991 --> 10:26.858
But, um, Ray wanted to check
on some scratch off tickets

10:26.860 --> 10:28.860
or something,
so I'll hang with him,
meet you in the car, yeah?

10:28.862 --> 10:31.730
-Yeah, cool.
-Cool, man. Alright,
see you in a sec.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.398
Hey, do you have,
uh, any Lucky Ducks?

10:33.400 --> 10:36.968
-Um, Lucky Duck?
-Scratch-offs.

10:36.970 --> 10:40.238
We've got, uh, Big Spender,
Gold Rush, Triple Play.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.642
-No Lucky Ducks, sorry.
-Oh, what a shame, whatever.
We'll get them somewhere else.

10:43.644 --> 10:46.111
It's just, that's the only
thing my mom plays, so.

10:46.113 --> 10:49.681
-Check it out. Check it out.
-[clerk] Hey. Hey!

10:49.683 --> 10:51.149
Fuck me! Hey, have fun, Ray.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.350
You little piece of shit--

10:52.352 --> 10:53.785
-[fist thuds]
-[clerk] Whoa!

10:53.787 --> 10:54.953
[clerk clatters]

10:54.955 --> 10:57.789
[intense music]

12:22.242 --> 12:27.746
-[bell dings]
-Ray. Oh, my God.
Wait, is he okay?

12:28.949 --> 12:30.148
Yeah, he'll be fine.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.283
We should go though.

12:32.285 --> 12:36.054
-Jesus.
-[Ray sighs]

12:36.056 --> 12:37.956
Wait, you got some?

12:38.859 --> 12:40.125
[scoffs] Yeah.

12:43.497 --> 12:44.763
You waited for me?

12:46.366 --> 12:48.066
You're family.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.768
I wouldn't leave
you there alone.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.072
-[Vic] Okay.
-[Zoe] Okay.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.940
-So, go up, up there.
-[Eric] Uh-huh.

12:55.942 --> 12:58.476
Zoe, do you want to just
fucking play?

12:58.478 --> 13:00.879
Yeah, I actually do, but since
you two have the remotes--

13:00.881 --> 13:02.881
Then cut the backseat driving.
Come on, let's go.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.949
Okay, let me get
the sniper first.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.418
-Oh! You made it.
-Now we're on opposing--

13:07.420 --> 13:09.420
[Kim] Yeah, thanks.

13:09.422 --> 13:10.789
No problem.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.924
Oh, way to go, Ray.

13:14.528 --> 13:17.529
[Vic] Oh, Ray got that ass.

13:17.531 --> 13:19.864
[Kim] The only thing Eric ever
got was a bag of chips, huh.

13:19.866 --> 13:22.200
[Vic] He got a lighter once.
Don't forget that lighter.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.469
[Zoe] Yeah, at least
you got out. Not like when he...

13:24.471 --> 13:26.171
[eerie music]

13:26.173 --> 13:28.006
[muffled voices]

13:29.342 --> 13:31.109
It's really funny,
isn't it, Ray?

13:33.213 --> 13:35.413
[Kim] We're just kidding,
Eric, Jesus. [chuckles]

13:36.449 --> 13:38.383
[Vic] Yeah, man, lighten up.

13:39.186 --> 13:42.053
-Here.
-[chuckles]

13:42.055 --> 13:44.255
Alright. So.

14:01.408 --> 14:02.574
[school bell rings]

14:23.630 --> 14:25.296
Hey, Ray, you got a second?

14:27.367 --> 14:28.333
Sure.

14:31.171 --> 14:35.974
Shelters, foster homes,
physical abuse.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.178
No kid deserves your childhood.

14:44.618 --> 14:45.617
I'm fine.

14:49.489 --> 14:50.889
These kids...

14:52.626 --> 14:54.158
they know I love them.

14:55.161 --> 14:57.228
But as you can tell,

14:57.230 --> 14:59.530
they're basically
a bunch of slobs. [laughs]

15:04.271 --> 15:07.171
I can use a hand cleaning up
a couple days after school.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.508
I mean, it doesn't pay much,

15:10.510 --> 15:13.244
but there's always pretty good
snacks in the staff room.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.415
Yeah, okay.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.516
Great.

15:21.121 --> 15:24.656
Just come by Wednesday, last
period's all football players.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.959
It's a disaster area.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.062
Is that it?

15:31.064 --> 15:32.063
That's it.

16:02.395 --> 16:05.330
What actually happens,
if you get into trouble,

16:05.332 --> 16:06.597
what do they do to you?

16:09.970 --> 16:11.369
You want to hit me?

16:12.238 --> 16:13.438
You do.

16:14.341 --> 16:17.709
Come on, Ray,
come on, fucking hit me.

16:17.711 --> 16:19.610
What did I ever do to you?

16:22.515 --> 16:24.048
You didn't do fucking anything.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.184
[slaps]

16:26.186 --> 16:27.752
You're just a fucking pussy.

Hello?

17:57.577 --> 17:58.676
Uh...

17:59.813 --> 18:01.712
I'm from the liquor

Found your wallet?

Thanks for the other night.

Hmm.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.729
I hope you fucked him up good,
whoever he is.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.633
You met him that night.

19:01.474 --> 19:02.907
Your friend?

19:02.909 --> 19:04.142
Who set you up?

19:04.844 --> 19:06.277
He's not my friend.

19:11.618 --> 19:13.618
Look, man, people only push you

19:13.620 --> 19:15.286
as far as you fucking let them.

I just can't get
in trouble again.

you don't get caught.

took your power away.

No, please don't do that.

I don't think that's possible.

to do about this, huh?

30:41.006 --> 30:42.506
Nothing ain't an option, Ray.

going to have milk and cookies

You just want it to stop.

31:21.981 --> 31:24.481
You're too focused
on getting caught, Ray-Ray.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.550
Don't worry about
that shit, alright?

31:27.353 --> 31:29.119
There are ways, baby.

31:29.121 --> 31:30.520
There are ways.

31:32.591 --> 31:34.925
[sighs] Alright.

31:37.963 --> 31:40.898
So, you're in school.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.067
What does every school have?

31:46.906 --> 31:50.607
Pencils. Okay? Sharpen up
a pencil real good,

31:50.609 --> 31:52.676
walk up behind him, bam,

31:52.678 --> 31:55.612
stab him right in
the temple and keep on walking.

31:59.385 --> 32:00.350
Okay?

32:07.059 --> 32:08.926
He takes gym right?

32:08.928 --> 32:10.661
-Right?
-Yeah.

32:10.663 --> 32:13.931
Find out when his gym class is,
when he's taking a shower,

32:13.933 --> 32:16.967
get behind him,
ram his head into the wall.

32:16.969 --> 32:20.404
He'll fall down,
hit his head on the tile, boom.

32:20.406 --> 32:22.539
You tell people he slipped.

32:22.541 --> 32:24.041
I can't do either
of those things.

32:24.043 --> 32:25.442
Hey!

32:25.444 --> 32:27.945
You got one fucking option now.

32:27.947 --> 32:29.379
Fight back.

32:41.994 --> 32:44.227
You can always go
old school on his ass.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.198
Hey.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.299
You can look at it,

32:49.301 --> 32:50.701
I didn't say you can touch it.

32:54.673 --> 32:55.973
You can touch it.

You can touch it.

Touch it.

Go ahead.

33:04.717 --> 33:06.717
Just remember, it ain't yours.

33:06.719 --> 33:07.751
Alright.

33:52.765 --> 33:54.398
I broke up with Eric.

The way he's treated you, Ray.

34:03.575 --> 34:05.075
I'm so sorry.

Violence is a waste
of energy and solves nothing.

35:33.365 --> 35:35.198
Why don't you tell that to Eric?

35:37.436 --> 35:40.337
You know, people only push you
as far as you let them.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.173
That's true.

35:43.175 --> 35:45.342
But it doesn't mean you have
to turn to violence.

35:45.344 --> 35:46.710
I'm not turning to violence.

35:52.784 --> 35:54.351
Then tell someone.

35:55.154 --> 35:56.686
You don't have to be a victim.

35:58.157 --> 35:59.222
If you say so.

36:01.793 --> 36:02.792
Ray, look at me.

36:09.535 --> 36:12.402
There's a line that society
has tattooed collectively

36:12.404 --> 36:13.670
on our brains.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.772
A line that we can't step over.

36:17.609 --> 36:21.178
And if you think violence is
the only action, you're wrong.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.347
Restraint is an action.

39:06.712 --> 39:08.345
Why'd you do it?

39:17.055 --> 39:18.555
'Cause it needed doing.

39:19.624 --> 39:20.990
I was taking care of it.

39:20.992 --> 39:22.058
Bullshit.

39:25.564 --> 39:26.996
Eric's an asshole but
he didn't deserve to get--

39:26.998 --> 39:29.099
I'm not going to explain
myself to you, Ray.

39:29.935 --> 39:31.501
You can't just kill people.

39:31.503 --> 39:33.069
It's easier than you think.

39:34.406 --> 39:36.473
This is what I'm talking about.

39:36.475 --> 39:38.608
You're not up for the task.

39:38.610 --> 39:41.411
Eric knew it.
He fucking smelled it.

39:42.714 --> 39:46.082
You think he'd ever be
scared of you, huh? Nope.

39:49.988 --> 39:51.388
I can never do that.

39:53.425 --> 39:54.557
You asked for help.

39:54.559 --> 39:58.428
Frankly, I was expecting
a little fucking gratitude.

-Here?

40:36.768 --> 40:38.435
How many bodies have you buried?

40:39.704 --> 40:40.737
That's what I thought.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.126
There we go.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.666
I saw a girl.

41:11.002 --> 41:11.968
What?

41:11.970 --> 41:15.472
I saw a girl,
in front of your house.

41:18.844 --> 41:20.844
-She's not going
to say anything.
-Mm.

41:22.247 --> 41:23.813
That depends.

41:25.016 --> 41:26.082
On what?

41:26.084 --> 41:29.786
Well, we need a good story
for why you got in my car

41:29.788 --> 41:31.120
in the middle of the night.

41:37.762 --> 41:39.529

plants at night?

41:58.617 --> 41:59.616
Come on.

42:00.952 --> 42:02.185
Think, Ray.

42:19.804 --> 42:21.638
Couldn't do them during the day.

42:23.742 --> 42:25.542
As much as
I can't stand you right now,

42:25.544 --> 42:26.809
I actually like that.

[Ray] Yeah, I, uh, been
working with him after school.

talk about, Ray-Ray?

Seems like you've been...
somewhere else lately.

you're barely paying attention.

Who's that?

It's my biology teacher.

Hmm. What's his name?

Name?

want to eat?

tell him anything.

You wanted to though,
didn't you?

didn't, Ray Gun.

do that to your partner.

See... I don't usually
interact with civilians,

57:42.059 --> 57:46.862
but I took an exception
to you, because I like you

57:46.864 --> 57:49.631
and I actually looked
forward to you stopping by.

57:52.470 --> 57:53.735
Me too.

57:53.737 --> 57:55.137
And I know that...

I get it.

don't got to worry about that.

58:15.125 --> 58:16.091
Want to know why?

58:17.228 --> 58:21.230
Because I... got your back.

[grunts]

58:23.734 --> 58:25.701
Something to help you
remember that.

I want you to really...
look at it.

58:34.011 --> 58:36.712

right there, huh?

We're good, hot stuff.

58:55.599 --> 58:57.099
Huh? Besides...

58:58.602 --> 59:00.135
I got to get out of town.

59:01.105 --> 59:02.204
What?

59:02.206 --> 59:04.606
Too bad, huh? I know.

59:04.608 --> 59:06.708
Could've gotten into
a lot more trouble together.

59:08.112 --> 59:09.545
Where you going?

59:10.548 --> 59:11.780
[sighs]

59:13.284 --> 59:15.717
Would you mind
walking back from here?

59:18.656 --> 59:19.721
Sure.

59:20.724 --> 59:21.723
Alright.

59:29.567 --> 59:30.732
Ray...

59:31.936 --> 59:33.569
can I borrow
your phone real quick?

59:34.572 --> 59:35.904
Why?

59:35.906 --> 59:39.041
I got to tie up
a couple loose ends.

59:41.845 --> 59:43.845
It's always something, right?

59:43.847 --> 59:45.047
That it is.

59:47.151 --> 59:49.051
Your cousin and that teacher.

[suspenseful music]

59:50.354 --> 59:52.287
-[Shepard] Bye, Radio.
-Hey! Hey!

59:52.289 --> 59:54.122
[Shepard] I'll see you
at Dwyer's.

1:00:23.354 --> 1:00:26.989
-[Dwyer] A little late
for a house call, Mr. Williams.
-[Shepard] Yes, I'm, I'm sorry,

1:00:26.991 --> 1:00:30.025
but, uh,
I was worried about Ray, and,

1:00:30.027 --> 1:00:34.262
well, honestly, he,
he speaks so highly of you, so.

1:00:34.264 --> 1:00:35.964
He's a special kid.

1:00:38.068 --> 1:00:38.984
I agree.

1:00:38.985 --> 1:00:39.901
-Have a seat.
-Oh, thank you.

1:00:41.705 --> 1:00:43.238
This is, uh...

1:00:45.309 --> 1:00:47.075
quite a couch.

1:00:47.077 --> 1:00:48.043
Thanks.

1:00:48.045 --> 1:00:52.381
You know, I don't feel
comfortable talking
about a student

1:00:52.383 --> 1:00:54.650
unless it's in
a professional setting.

1:00:55.386 --> 1:00:57.119

1:00:57.121 --> 1:00:59.388
I'm sensing some hostility here.

1:01:01.325 --> 1:01:02.958
No, I'm just playing it safe.

1:01:02.960 --> 1:01:04.026
Ah.

1:01:05.229 --> 1:01:07.696
-For Ray.
-Sure, sure, for Ray. I get it.

1:01:08.365 --> 1:01:13.201
Well, he mentioned to me
that you all have been spending

1:01:13.203 --> 1:01:15.704
a lot of time together.
A lot of quality time.

1:01:15.706 --> 1:01:17.272
A lot of alone time,

1:01:17.274 --> 1:01:20.375
and, uh, I wanted to speak
with you about that.

1:01:23.814 --> 1:01:25.280
You want something to drink?

1:01:26.150 --> 1:01:27.315
I would love a beer.
