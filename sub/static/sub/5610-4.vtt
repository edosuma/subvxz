40:52.780 --> 40:54.486
AND AS FAR AS
THE BUREAU'S CONCERNED,

40:54.490 --> 40:56.117
YOU ARE OFFICIALLY
RETRAINING.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.190
AND IF
YOU FAIL OUT OF HERE...

40:58.200 --> 41:00.111
YOU ARE OUT.

41:00.120 --> 41:03.123
So do whatever you want
with the Assistant Director.

41:03.130 --> 41:04.700
She can't save you.

41:12.300 --> 41:13.346
THEY BOUGHT IT.

41:13.350 --> 41:14.635
THEY HAVE NO IDEA
YOU WERE THERE.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.346
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I TRUSTED YOU.

41:16.350 --> 41:18.079
OKAY, LOOK, IF MY --

41:18.090 --> 41:20.547
If my allegiance
was to the FBI,

41:20.550 --> 41:22.893
you and Alex would both
be in handcuffs right now.

41:22.900 --> 41:24.299
I did what I could do.

41:24.310 --> 41:26.858
It is my ass on the line, too,
you know.

41:31.910 --> 41:33.775
SO,
WHAT THE HELL DO WE DO NOW?

41:41.410 --> 41:43.492
-UP.
-[ GROANS ]

41:44.830 --> 41:47.663
YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME HOW THIS
WIRE FROM YOUR FAMILY BUSINESS

41:47.670 --> 41:49.877
ENDED UP
AS A PART OF THOSE BOMBS.

41:49.880 --> 41:51.711
I DON'T HAVE TO
TELL YOU ANYTHING.

41:51.720 --> 41:54.462
OH, YOU WILL,
EVENTUALLY.

41:54.470 --> 41:56.335
'CAUSE
YOU'RE MY HOSTAGE NOW,

41:56.340 --> 41:58.547
AND I WILL WAIT
FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES.

42:00.590 --> 42:02.399
Clayton:
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY, LISTEN UP.

42:03.560 --> 42:05.221
THIS ORDER'S JUST COME THROUGH.

42:05.230 --> 42:06.629
PARRISH HAS BEEN IN THE WIND
LONG ENOUGH

42:06.640 --> 42:08.392
AND SHE'S TAKEN
ANOTHER HOSTAGE.

42:08.400 --> 42:10.686
BUT FROM THIS POINT ON,
ALL LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

42:10.690 --> 42:12.601
ARE BEING TOLD
IF THEY SEE PARRISH,

42:12.610 --> 42:14.521
THEY ARE TO TAKE NO PRISONERS.

42:14.530 --> 42:16.907
FROM HERE ON OUT,
IT'S SHOOT TO KILL.
