01:21.166 --> 01:23.157
The golden eagle is not
just a bird.

01:24.709 --> 01:27.155
It's a natural wonder.

01:27.166 --> 01:29.703
But now it's on
the endangered species list,

01:29.709 --> 01:32.155
so the Phoenix Foundation
came up with a project

01:32.166 --> 01:35.158
to ensure its survival.

01:35.166 --> 01:38.158
I was going to follow a pair
of eagles that had mated,

01:38.166 --> 01:40.157
and, hopefully,
find their nest.

01:47.709 --> 01:49.700
It was called
The Dead Horse Point Project.

01:49.709 --> 01:51.700
The idea was
to make sure the eagle eggs,

01:52.208 --> 01:54.199
if there were any,
were protected

01:54.208 --> 01:57.200
from their natural enemies
like hawks, mountain lions,

01:57.208 --> 02:00.200
and, of course, man.

02:01.709 --> 02:03.199
It was a job

02:03.208 --> 02:06.200
Pete Thornton didn't have
to twist my arm to accept.

02:06.750 --> 02:08.741
And to track an eagle,
you've got to sort of...

02:09.208 --> 02:10.744
become one.

02:11.208 --> 02:12.744
Get up there with 'em.

02:19.208 --> 02:21.199
Now, if you don't like heights,

02:21.208 --> 02:23.745
climbing a mountain while
you're carrying a container

02:23.750 --> 02:25.741
with a hang glider
inside it might seem

02:26.250 --> 02:29.742
like a strange thing to do,

02:29.750 --> 02:32.742
especially when the weather
starts to get very cold...

02:34.750 --> 02:36.741
...very fast.

02:44.250 --> 02:46.241
golden eagles mate for life,

02:46.792 --> 02:48.783
and if Pete Thornton's
information was correct,

02:49.250 --> 02:51.241
there was only one pair
in the area.

02:52.792 --> 02:55.249
I was hoping the bird
I'd seen was one of them.

03:06.792 --> 03:09.283
The climb up to look
for those eagles took me

03:09.291 --> 03:11.282
from summer to winter
in the same day.

03:12.792 --> 03:13.781
And there they were...

03:15.792 --> 03:17.282
...sitting on the most
inaccessible roost

03:17.792 --> 03:20.784
I had ever seen.

03:20.792 --> 03:22.783
Of course it didn't seem
inaccessible to them.

03:24.834 --> 03:26.825
It may seem cruel,

03:26.834 --> 03:29.826
but one animal's death means
another will live.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.825
All a part
of nature's balancing act.

03:34.291 --> 03:36.828
Civilization had thrown
that balance out of whack,

03:36.834 --> 03:39.280
and when it came
to those two eagles,

03:39.291 --> 03:40.280
it was my job to see

03:40.834 --> 03:42.290
if they could stick around
long enough

03:42.291 --> 03:43.280
to put the scales back
in order.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.825
When you're hang gliding,
you feel like

03:55.834 --> 03:56.823
you're part of the sky.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.325
Maybe that's why I can fly
hundreds of feet off the ground

04:09.333 --> 04:10.869
without the sweaty palms I get

04:10.875 --> 04:12.866
when I look down
from a stepladder.

04:22.333 --> 04:23.869
I guess the way you look
at the world

04:23.875 --> 04:25.365
depends on where you are.

04:25.375 --> 04:29.869
From up here, it looked
like a pretty nice place.

04:39.375 --> 04:42.367
They say imitation's
the sincerest form of flattery.

04:42.375 --> 04:45.913
That's why I was copying
the eagles' flight path,

04:46.375 --> 04:48.912
so they'd feel comfortable
with me around

04:48.917 --> 04:50.373
and let me follow them
long enough

04:50.917 --> 04:53.374
to find their nest...
wherever it was.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.954
Apparently, I wasn't alone
with the eagles.

05:32.959 --> 05:37.407
There was somebody else
just as hooked on 'em as I was.

05:51.959 --> 05:53.449
Gas is gettin' low.

05:53.458 --> 05:54.447
We better head in.

05:54.959 --> 05:56.950
You said we'd bag some game.

05:56.959 --> 05:58.449
What about that ram?

05:58.458 --> 05:59.948
Everyone has a bighorn
on the wall.

05:59.959 --> 06:00.948
I want something

06:00.959 --> 06:02.950
special.

06:02.959 --> 06:03.994
Watch it, will ya?

06:04.458 --> 06:06.449
Oh, sorry, Mr. Nystrom.

06:08.458 --> 06:09.994
Couple of birds over there.

06:10.458 --> 06:10.992
Move in on them!

06:19.001 --> 06:19.990
You missed.

06:21.458 --> 06:22.994
Hey, those are golden eagles!

06:23.001 --> 06:24.992
I know what they are!

06:25.001 --> 06:26.491
I'd be the first one in the club

06:27.001 --> 06:27.990
to hang one on the wall.

06:28.001 --> 06:29.992
It's against the law!

06:34.500 --> 06:36.491
Missed again.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.491
Ah, this thing is jammed!

06:48.500 --> 06:49.990
You couldn't hit 'em anyway.

06:50.500 --> 06:51.990
Why don't you just fly
this thing?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.992
If you're so good,
why don't you try my crossbow?

06:55.000 --> 06:55.489
Give me!

06:57.500 --> 06:59.491
You don't have a prayer.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.536
Got him!
Pretty good shot.

07:13.542 --> 07:14.998
You just winged him.

07:25.542 --> 07:28.033
I always wanted a matched pair.

07:30.542 --> 07:34.034
Sometimes, the best way
to distract a guy is

07:34.041 --> 07:35.030
to make him see the light.

07:36.542 --> 07:37.031
What's that?

07:41.041 --> 07:42.531
That guy wants
to play games with me,

07:42.542 --> 07:44.578
I'll knock him right out
of the sky!

07:49.041 --> 07:50.030
Ghant, watch it!

07:51.041 --> 07:51.575
What happened?

07:52.041 --> 07:52.575
Eagle hit the skid.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.073
You happy now? He's hurt.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.074
Let's get out of here.

08:22.083 --> 08:24.074
It looked like the eagle

08:24.083 --> 08:25.619
that flew towards the
north face of the mountain

08:25.625 --> 08:27.081
was in shock.

08:27.083 --> 08:29.074
I didn't have enough lift
to get up to it,

08:29.083 --> 08:31.074
so I figured helping the boy
with the wounded one

08:31.083 --> 08:33.073
was my next best choice.

08:37.625 --> 08:39.081
It's okay, Fred, stay still.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.115
Stay, Fred.

08:46.125 --> 08:47.615
Stay here. Calm down.

08:52.125 --> 08:54.116
Stay. Okay?

08:54.625 --> 08:55.614
Stay.

08:55.625 --> 08:57.115
Keep him here, all right?

08:57.125 --> 08:58.114
Mm-hmm.

08:58.625 --> 08:59.614
It might
distract the bird.

09:11.125 --> 09:12.114
Easy, baby.

09:14.125 --> 09:15.114
Come on,
come on.

09:16.667 --> 09:17.656
That's it.

09:17.667 --> 09:19.123
You better
tie the legs together.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.116
The talons are very dangerous.

09:22.125 --> 09:24.161
Here, you can use this.

09:24.166 --> 09:26.157
You got a place
I can work on his wing?

09:26.166 --> 09:28.157
Yeah, my grandpa's cabin.

09:34.667 --> 09:37.659
Oh, come on...

09:42.667 --> 09:43.656
Mom!

09:45.166 --> 09:46.155
Mom!

09:46.166 --> 09:48.157
Someone shot one of the eagles!

09:48.166 --> 09:49.702
What?!

09:51.166 --> 09:52.155
How bad is it?

09:52.166 --> 09:54.157
I think
his wing might be broken.

09:54.166 --> 09:55.702
I'm gonna need some help.

09:55.709 --> 09:56.698
Come on.

09:56.709 --> 09:58.165
We can use the shed.

10:01.709 --> 10:04.200
I'll put a blanket on the table.

10:05.709 --> 10:06.698
Here, Darin, let me get that.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.197
That's great.

10:09.208 --> 10:11.199
You got any rags
we could use for bandages?

10:11.208 --> 10:12.197
I'm gonna have
to set this wing.

10:12.709 --> 10:15.200
Yeah, we got
tons of 'em.

10:18.208 --> 10:19.197
That's great.

10:19.208 --> 10:20.698
There's a knife in my pocket.

10:20.709 --> 10:22.700
Get it.

10:25.750 --> 10:26.739
Darin, no!

10:27.208 --> 10:27.742
But I can do it.
Honey,

10:28.208 --> 10:28.742
you're gonna cut yourself.

10:31.208 --> 10:33.199
Darin!

10:33.208 --> 10:34.744
He's only

10:34.750 --> 10:35.739
ten years old.

10:35.750 --> 10:36.739
I don't know he expects.

10:36.750 --> 10:38.206
Okay, how much
of this do you need?

10:38.208 --> 10:39.197
Uh, just a cou
ple of strips.

10:39.208 --> 10:41.199
Long strips, please.

10:43.208 --> 10:44.243
My name's MacGyver.

10:44.250 --> 10:45.239
Oh, hi.

10:45.250 --> 10:46.740
Susan Cooper.

10:46.750 --> 10:47.739
Hi, Susan.

10:47.750 --> 10:49.741
Listen, I'm really gonna
need your help here.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.741
You're gonna have
to hold the bird

10:51.750 --> 10:52.739
while I wrap the wing.

10:52.750 --> 10:54.741
Um...

10:54.750 --> 10:56.240
Look, I've never done this
before, either,

10:56.750 --> 10:57.739
but it's got to be done.

10:57.750 --> 11:00.241
Okay.

11:02.750 --> 11:05.241
All right, here we go.

11:05.250 --> 11:06.786
Easy does it.

11:12.250 --> 11:13.786
Easy, baby.

11:14.792 --> 11:16.248
Careful.

11:16.250 --> 11:18.787
Here we go.

11:20.792 --> 11:22.248
Easy. Come on.

11:28.291 --> 11:29.781
Oh, I know, I know, I know.

11:34.291 --> 11:35.781
All right.

11:35.792 --> 11:37.783
Oh, good.

11:38.291 --> 11:39.280
Keep ahold of her.

11:39.291 --> 11:40.781
I'm gonna have
to make a splint here.

11:45.291 --> 11:47.282
Hang onto it real tight.

11:51.834 --> 11:53.290
All right,
when we're finished up here,

11:53.834 --> 11:55.290
we'll soak the rags
in antiseptic.

11:55.291 --> 11:56.827
You're sure you ne
ver done this before?

11:56.834 --> 11:58.825
Well, I had a parakeet
one time

11:58.834 --> 12:00.825
that went ten rounds
with a cat.

12:00.834 --> 12:03.280
I patched him up,
and he lived to fight again.

12:03.291 --> 12:05.327
I didn't think
anybody was living up here.

12:05.834 --> 12:07.825
Oh, this was my dad's place.

12:07.834 --> 12:10.325
Darin and I came
out a few weeks ago.

12:10.333 --> 12:12.824
Oh, it's a nice place
for a vacation.

12:12.834 --> 12:14.825
Well, I'm trying
to fix some things.

12:14.834 --> 12:18.326
Yeah, these old cabins
can sure use a lot of work.

12:18.333 --> 12:20.824
Oh, I wouldn't know a hammer
from a chain saw.

12:20.834 --> 12:22.825
No, I meanfixsome things:

12:22.834 --> 12:25.871
Darin... me...

12:28.333 --> 12:30.324
Darin?

12:32.333 --> 12:36.326
Darin!

12:36.333 --> 12:38.324
I thought
he would have stuck around

12:38.333 --> 12:39.869
to see
some of our handiwork.

12:40.333 --> 12:42.870
No. There's a rocky point
just beyond

12:42.875 --> 12:44.365
that ridge up there.
That's where he goes

12:44.875 --> 12:46.365
when we have
an argument.

12:46.375 --> 12:47.364
He's there a lot lately.

13:01.375 --> 13:04.913
Be careful with that ram.

13:04.917 --> 13:06.908
When do we pick up that eagle?
Tomorrow?

13:06.917 --> 13:08.908
There'll be nothing
but feathers left

13:08.917 --> 13:10.373
after the coyotes get through.

13:10.375 --> 13:11.911
What's the point of killing it

13:11.917 --> 13:13.373
if I can't put it in my den?

13:13.375 --> 13:15.912
There is a $5,000 fine
for killing golden eagles.

13:15.917 --> 13:17.373
It is a protected species.

13:17.375 --> 13:19.366
So is the bighorn,
but I bagged one of them.

13:19.917 --> 13:20.906
You know,
I'm really worried

13:20.917 --> 13:22.908
about that guy
in the hang glider.

13:22.917 --> 13:23.906
He saw us shoot that eagle.

13:24.417 --> 13:25.406
Now, if he goes
to the park rangers

13:25.917 --> 13:27.407
and tells them
what he saw, we could...

13:27.417 --> 13:29.408
Listen,
maybe he's got a soft spot.

13:29.417 --> 13:30.907
Everybody does.

13:30.917 --> 13:32.908
Women, booze,
he owes the bookies...

13:32.917 --> 13:35.408
something he doesn't want
out of the bag.

13:35.417 --> 13:36.907
Find him and buy him.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.407
Yeah, but...

13:42.417 --> 13:43.907
That guy
on the hang glider talks,

13:43.917 --> 13:44.952
we could lose the business.

13:45.417 --> 13:46.406
''Business''?

13:46.959 --> 13:48.950
That guy talks,

13:48.959 --> 13:51.951
there'll be federal agents
crawling all over here.

13:51.959 --> 13:54.416
Why do you think
I busted out of prison

13:54.417 --> 13:56.408
and moved
to the middle of nowhere?

13:56.417 --> 13:58.954
They want to put me back
on death row.

13:58.959 --> 14:00.950
I ain't going
to let that happen.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.993
Your mom and I got the arrow out
of the bird's wing.

14:31.001 --> 14:33.447
I think
he's going to be all right.

14:35.001 --> 14:36.992
He's a she.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.457
Oh.

14:38.458 --> 14:39.994
You know about eagles?

14:40.001 --> 14:42.447
I've been studying them
for a few years.

14:42.458 --> 14:43.994
My dad sends me books on them.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.491
Did you see
where the male eagle went?

14:47.500 --> 14:48.990
He landed on the mountain,
I think.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.991
If they don't
get back together...

14:52.001 --> 14:54.492
They have one mate
their whole life.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.991
There could be a nest out there
with eggs in it,

14:57.001 --> 14:57.990
or young eagles, maybe.

14:58.001 --> 15:00.993
If one of the adults dies,
or something,

15:01.001 --> 15:02.491
the young will die too,

15:02.500 --> 15:05.992
'cause one adult
can't take care of them alone.

15:07.500 --> 15:08.990
They aren't going to die.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.491
Not if we have anything
to say about it.

15:12.500 --> 15:13.990
Name's MacGyver.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.991
I know;
I heard you tell Mom.

15:20.500 --> 15:21.990
You know, when
I was your age,

15:22.000 --> 15:23.490
I'd have given anything

15:23.500 --> 15:25.536
to spend time in
a place like this.

15:25.542 --> 15:28.534
Ah, this place is okay.

15:28.542 --> 15:31.989
Darin...

15:32.000 --> 15:33.991
I think your mom's
worried about you.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.537
It's, uh, it's a
good kind of worry,

15:37.000 --> 15:38.536
if you know what I mean.

15:38.542 --> 15:40.999
She just doesn't want
to see you hurt yourself.

15:41.000 --> 15:41.989
Neither do I.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.537
I just want to do things.

15:44.542 --> 15:46.533
She won't let me.

15:46.542 --> 15:47.531
Have you talked to her about it?

15:49.542 --> 15:50.531
Have you tried?

15:50.542 --> 15:52.032
She doesn't listen.

15:52.041 --> 15:56.034
Well, if you don't talk,
what's she going to listen to?

15:58.542 --> 16:00.032
Just a thought.

16:21.583 --> 16:23.039
Any change, Darin?

16:23.583 --> 16:26.074
I think
she's getting weaker.

16:26.083 --> 16:27.573
Hey!

16:27.583 --> 16:29.073
Anybody home?

16:29.083 --> 16:30.573
It's MacGyver!

16:39.083 --> 16:41.074
Hey. How's our patient?

16:41.583 --> 16:43.073
She doesn't like
being in that box.

16:43.083 --> 16:47.076
Wow, it must be great flying on
this hang glider!

16:47.083 --> 16:48.619
Yeah, it is.

16:48.625 --> 16:50.081
So when arewegoing up, huh?

16:50.083 --> 16:51.072
You kidding?

16:51.625 --> 16:52.614
My mom'd never let me go.

16:53.083 --> 16:54.619
You going to stay over?

16:54.625 --> 16:57.617
Well, um...

16:57.625 --> 16:58.614
He can, can't he?

16:59.083 --> 17:00.619
Sure, if he wants to.

17:00.625 --> 17:02.616
Okay, it's after 9:00, honey.

17:02.625 --> 17:04.080
But I was talking to MacGyver.

17:04.083 --> 17:06.118
Well, you can talk
in the morning; let's go.

17:06.125 --> 17:07.615
I want to sleep in the shed.

17:07.625 --> 17:09.115
Oh, Darin, please.

17:09.625 --> 17:11.115
That way I could keep an eye
on the eagle.

17:11.125 --> 17:13.116
The eagle is going
to sleep in her bed.

17:13.125 --> 17:14.615
You're going to sleep in your bed.

17:14.625 --> 17:17.116
I'm not a baby anymore.

17:26.125 --> 17:28.116
You know, the only arguments

17:28.667 --> 17:31.659
I ever had with my mother
were about bedtime.

17:32.125 --> 17:34.662
I finally had to let her
stay up till 10:00.

17:42.125 --> 17:43.661
I wish
you hadn't given him that.

17:43.667 --> 17:44.656
I'm sorry.

17:44.667 --> 17:45.656
I should have asked.

18:03.166 --> 18:06.704
Nature gives people
and animals instincts

18:06.709 --> 18:10.702
that help them to survive,
but up on the mountain,

18:10.709 --> 18:13.701
a part of nature
was in danger of disappearing,

18:13.709 --> 18:16.701
and instinct alone
wasn't going to save it.

18:33.709 --> 18:35.700
Sugar cubes
are a great source of energy.

18:35.709 --> 18:39.702
I figured the eagle
on the mountain might need it.

18:57.208 --> 18:59.199
Morning.

18:59.208 --> 19:01.745
How you doing?

19:01.750 --> 19:03.741
Hmm?

19:06.250 --> 19:08.241
Will you let me touch you?

19:11.250 --> 19:13.741
I bet you miss your mate,
don't you?

19:17.750 --> 19:19.741
Yeah.

19:24.792 --> 19:27.249
If you're going
to scale a mountain,

19:27.250 --> 19:29.787
you need the right things
to do it with.

19:29.792 --> 19:31.248
Susan's dad had been a climber,

19:31.792 --> 19:34.249
and some of the equipment
was still there: rope...

19:39.250 --> 19:41.241
...carabiners...

19:41.250 --> 19:43.787
climber's hammer...

19:46.291 --> 19:47.280
...and a ice ax.

19:47.291 --> 19:50.283
But after that, the pickin's

19:50.291 --> 19:53.283
started getting mighty slim...
tent stakes instead of pitons.

19:55.291 --> 19:59.284
And if Darin's dog didn't mind,
his leash clips

19:59.792 --> 20:02.283
were going to be
my extra carabiners.

20:02.291 --> 20:03.280
They looked good,

20:03.291 --> 20:06.829
if you didn't look too close.

20:11.291 --> 20:13.282
Good morning.

20:15.291 --> 20:16.280
Morning.

20:18.291 --> 20:19.280
How's she doing?

20:19.291 --> 20:20.827
Not so good.

20:20.834 --> 20:22.290
Oh.

20:22.834 --> 20:24.290
What's that?
Oh, it's

20:24.291 --> 20:25.827
a little trick.

20:25.834 --> 20:28.325
Take the inside out of a pen,
you know what you got?

20:28.333 --> 20:29.823
Bird feeder.

20:30.333 --> 20:31.823
Darin said
she won't eat when she's hurt.

20:31.834 --> 20:33.825
Yeah, it's for the male eagle.

20:33.834 --> 20:37.827
Hit that helicopter yesterday;
I figure he's in shock.

20:37.834 --> 20:40.826
Little sugar water
will bring him out of it.

20:40.834 --> 20:42.825
And I could use
this climbing equipment too,

20:42.834 --> 20:45.325
but you don't have half enough
carabiners or pitons.

20:45.333 --> 20:47.870
You wouldn't happen to know
if you got any more?

20:47.875 --> 20:49.866
You're going to look
for the male eagle

20:49.875 --> 20:50.864
on the mountain?

20:51.333 --> 20:52.322
You don't even know
if he's up there.

20:52.333 --> 20:53.869
I saw him fall.

20:54.333 --> 20:56.324
I heard him last night.

20:56.333 --> 20:58.870
I figure he's on
the north face somewhere.

20:58.875 --> 21:01.332
The north face is sheer granite.

21:01.333 --> 21:03.324
Look, Darin said
if the eagles are separated,

21:03.875 --> 21:06.366
they'll never be able to hatch
their eggs or raise their young.

21:06.875 --> 21:09.366
I'm just going to bring the two
of them together, that's all.

21:14.375 --> 21:16.866
Hey, you know what
my dad used this for?

21:16.875 --> 21:18.365
No.
A hat.

21:18.375 --> 21:19.865
It'll help us keep track of you
when you're on

21:19.875 --> 21:21.365
the mountain.
Thanks.

21:28.375 --> 21:31.367
Well, looky, looky, looky,
looky, looky, looky.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.366
Wonder who belongs to that Jeep?

21:34.375 --> 21:35.364
One way to find out.

21:47.417 --> 21:49.908
Look at this stuff.

21:49.917 --> 21:51.908
This must be the guy.

21:51.917 --> 21:53.407
What's that?

21:53.917 --> 21:54.906
Jeep registration.

21:55.417 --> 21:56.406
MacGyver.

21:59.917 --> 22:01.407
Uh, we're not asking
for any trouble.

22:01.917 --> 22:03.407
Listen, why don't you
let me talk to him?

22:03.417 --> 22:05.954
I mean, you're not going
to do anything stupid, are you,

22:05.959 --> 22:07.950
like killing that bank guard
for no reason?

22:07.959 --> 22:10.416
Curry, when you've
already killed one man,

22:10.959 --> 22:12.950
killing another one
don't really matter.

22:13.417 --> 22:15.954
Especially when it means
staying out of the chair.

22:27.083 --> 22:29.620
Some people think of a mountain
as just a big rock.

22:33.625 --> 22:36.617
Well, this one wasn't.

22:37.083 --> 22:38.619
And it's not very often

22:38.625 --> 22:40.616
that you can get
an eagle's-eye view

22:41.125 --> 22:43.616
of your own personal waterfall.

22:44.125 --> 22:46.616
It took a little doing,

22:46.625 --> 22:48.115
but I found out in a hurry

22:48.125 --> 22:50.616
the things
a climber really needs...

22:50.625 --> 22:56.621
a pair of strong hands,
a set of steady nerves,

22:56.625 --> 22:59.116
and a paid-up insurance policy.

23:09.125 --> 23:11.116
There it is... the hang glider.

23:11.667 --> 23:13.123
At least this guy, uh...

23:13.667 --> 23:14.656
MacGyver...

23:14.667 --> 23:18.159
MacGyver... ain't flying
around somewhere.

23:18.166 --> 23:19.656
Well, let's just
wait for him here, then

23:20.166 --> 23:21.656
Well, who knows
if he's going to show?

23:21.667 --> 23:23.157
He could be down
in that cabin

23:23.166 --> 23:25.157
talking to the ranger
on the shortwave.

23:25.667 --> 23:27.658
Well, we're just going to buy him
off anyway, right?

23:28.166 --> 23:30.157
Hey, look, I'm warning you, don
't you do anything...

23:30.166 --> 23:31.656
What makes you think
he wants to be bought?!

23:32.166 --> 23:34.157
He goes
right to the cops,

23:34.166 --> 23:36.657
it's my life
on the line, Curry!

23:37.166 --> 23:40.158
I'll take him out
if I got to...

23:40.166 --> 23:41.702
and anyone else, too.

23:41.709 --> 23:44.701
Now, let's stash the Rover
and walk on down there.

24:16.208 --> 24:17.197
I see MacGyver!

24:17.208 --> 24:18.744
He's climbing the mountain!

24:18.750 --> 24:20.206
Yeah, he went up to look for
the other eagle.

24:20.208 --> 24:23.200
He's almost up to the top!

24:26.750 --> 24:30.197
In a way, mountains
are kind of two-faced.

24:30.208 --> 24:33.746
From a distance,
they can look pretty smooth,

24:33.750 --> 24:36.742
but up close,
you see all the cracks...

24:36.750 --> 24:38.741
places where you
can hammer in a piton,

24:38.750 --> 24:43.244
or, if you've run out,
tent stakes.

24:51.250 --> 24:55.243
Fred! Fred, stop it!

24:58.250 --> 25:00.241
That's some watchdog
you got there.

25:03.250 --> 25:05.241
That hang glider wouldn't happen
to belong

25:05.250 --> 25:06.786
to a man named
MacGyver, would it?

25:07.250 --> 25:08.786
Yes.

25:08.792 --> 25:10.248
Well, I hate to be
the one to bring bad news,

25:10.250 --> 25:11.786
but, well, his
Jeep was crushed

25:11.792 --> 25:13.248
by a big tree at t
he entrance to the park.

25:13.250 --> 25:14.239
Where is he?

25:17.792 --> 25:19.783
Whoa! Is that him up there?

25:20.291 --> 25:21.280
Yep.

25:23.291 --> 25:25.782
What some folks'll do for fun.

25:25.792 --> 25:27.783
Well, we'll wait
right here for him,

25:27.792 --> 25:30.784
if it's okay with you.

25:59.834 --> 26:02.325
Climbing a mountain's
tough enough when your hands

26:02.834 --> 26:05.826
and feet have something solid
to grab onto.

26:05.834 --> 26:09.827
It's another story altogether
when you're hanging in midair

26:09.834 --> 26:12.826
from a tent stake
and a dog leash clip.

26:20.333 --> 26:21.869
Watching that tent stake fall

26:22.333 --> 26:24.324
gave me
a funny kind of feeling...

26:24.875 --> 26:27.867
a feeling that could keep a guy
from making long-range plans.

26:43.375 --> 26:45.366
Oh... oh...

26:45.375 --> 26:50.369
They say drowning men see
their lives flash before them.

26:50.375 --> 26:52.366
Falling men do, too.

26:52.375 --> 26:54.366
At least this man did.

26:54.375 --> 26:57.867
And what I saw
was about 50 years too short.

27:28.417 --> 27:30.908
I knew it was possible
that the eagle would take

27:30.917 --> 27:33.909
one look at me and decide
to fly someplace else,

27:34.417 --> 27:37.409
but that was a possibility
I tried not to think about.

27:37.417 --> 27:40.955
That kid's getting
on my nerves.

27:40.959 --> 27:43.416
I don't like the way
he looks at me...

27:43.417 --> 27:45.408
like he knows something.

27:45.417 --> 27:46.953
How could he possi
bly know anyth?

27:47.417 --> 27:49.408
I don't know how.

27:49.417 --> 27:51.408
He just bugs me.

27:57.417 --> 28:00.454
Your ears can play tricks
on you up in the mountains.

28:00.458 --> 28:03.450
Sound bounces
off rocks and ice,

28:03.458 --> 28:05.449
and even though you hear it,

28:05.458 --> 28:08.950
you don't really know
where it's coming from.

28:08.959 --> 28:12.451
I personally don't know
which is more dangerous...

28:12.458 --> 28:16.451
falling off a wedge of ice
down the side of a mountain

28:16.458 --> 28:20.451
or falling
into a thousand-foot crevice.

28:22.458 --> 28:24.449
And I really don't want
to know.

28:50.500 --> 28:54.493
An animal that's in shock
can be completely unpredictable,

28:54.500 --> 28:56.991
and when you're
out on a mountain ledge

28:57.001 --> 28:58.491
with a snowstorm coming up,

28:58.500 --> 29:01.492
surprises are
the last thing you want.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.993
I really wanted to get
that eagle down to the cabin,

29:24.000 --> 29:26.537
but then I remembered there's
only one kind of climber

29:26.542 --> 29:27.998
who tries to get
down a mountain

29:28.000 --> 29:30.537
in the middle of a snowstorm...

29:30.542 --> 29:33.534
the kind
you never hear from again.

29:47.542 --> 29:49.032
How's the boy?
Is he asleep?

29:49.041 --> 29:51.532
Yeah, he is.

29:53.542 --> 29:57.034
Oh, MacGyver could get caught
in this storm.

29:57.041 --> 29:59.032
I'm going to call the park rangers.

29:59.041 --> 30:01.578
You ain't calling anyone, honey.

30:03.041 --> 30:05.578
You cut my radio?!

30:16.583 --> 30:18.039
My instinct told me

30:18.041 --> 30:21.579
to do whatever I could
to keep that eagle alive.

30:21.583 --> 30:25.075
I guess his instinct
told him to let me.

30:51.625 --> 30:53.616
Feeling a little better, are we?

30:56.083 --> 30:59.120
What do you say
we get off this mountain?

31:21.667 --> 31:25.114
Getting down a mountain should
be easier than climbing it,

31:25.667 --> 31:27.123
but not necessarily.

32:22.709 --> 32:27.703
I'd seen an arrow
like this one before.

33:37.250 --> 33:39.286
The man with the cigar.

33:39.291 --> 33:40.781
I remember now.

33:40.792 --> 33:41.781
He was flying the helicopter

33:41.792 --> 33:43.783
when the eagle was shot.

33:43.792 --> 33:45.783
Darin, are you sure

33:46.291 --> 33:48.282
that man is the s...

34:05.834 --> 34:10.282
What I wanted to do
was get that guy's attention...

34:10.291 --> 34:14.830
and there was enough stuff
in the shed to do it.

34:15.291 --> 34:21.331
A gas stove, an old inner tube,
a bicycle, a grindstone.

34:21.333 --> 34:25.326
The problem was thinking
of what to do with them.

34:26.833 --> 34:29.324
I was right about the kid.

34:29.333 --> 34:31.324
He knows.

34:32.833 --> 34:34.824
Well, then, let's
just get out of here...

34:34.833 --> 34:36.824
I said the kid knows.

34:36.833 --> 34:38.870
Well, what are we gonna?

34:42.875 --> 34:44.331
You want to kill him?

34:44.333 --> 34:45.322
The woman, too.

34:45.333 --> 34:47.324
Well, you're out of your mind!

34:47.333 --> 34:49.324
Then we wait for MacGyver
at the base of the mountain.

34:49.875 --> 34:52.331
Look, I'm a businessman,
and I'm not going to do this!

34:52.333 --> 34:54.870
Listen, Curry, if it weren't
for the take on that bank job

34:54.875 --> 34:57.867
that put me on death row,
you wouldn't have a business.

34:57.875 --> 34:59.365
Now, understand something.

34:59.875 --> 35:02.366
If I go down again,
you go down with me this time.

35:04.375 --> 35:06.866
Ball bearings are
sort of like steel marbles.

35:06.875 --> 35:10.367
If you strike 'em hard enough
against a rough surface

35:10.375 --> 35:13.367
of a grindstone, they'll spark...

35:13.375 --> 35:16.367
just like the flint
in a cigarette lighter.

35:18.917 --> 35:21.909
Add to that a portable stove
with a propane tank

35:22.375 --> 35:24.912
and align it
at just the right angle

35:24.917 --> 35:26.373
with the grindstone
and a nearby window.

35:36.375 --> 35:38.366
Then, after you've
armed yourself

35:38.375 --> 35:41.913
with as many ball bearings
as you happen to have...

35:44.417 --> 35:46.408
...you just switch on the gas,

35:46.417 --> 35:50.410
and that'll give you
a very explosive combination.

36:27.959 --> 36:31.451
I remember using a bicycle
to deliver newspapers,

36:31.458 --> 36:35.451
go to the movies,
ride to Little League games...

36:37.959 --> 36:40.996
...but I never thought
I'd be using one as a slingshot.

36:51.458 --> 36:52.447
Leave her alone!

36:53.001 --> 36:53.990
Ghant, come on...

36:54.458 --> 36:55.994
What do you want?

36:58.458 --> 36:59.994
I'm just being friendly.

37:00.001 --> 37:01.992
Last chance she'll have.

37:08.500 --> 37:09.489
Run, Darin!

37:09.500 --> 37:10.990
Get him!

37:15.001 --> 37:15.990
Come on.

37:16.500 --> 37:18.991
Let me go!
Let me go!

37:19.000 --> 37:20.490
Let me go!

37:21.500 --> 37:22.990
Let me go!

37:31.500 --> 37:31.989
What was that?

37:32.500 --> 37:33.489
I'll take a look.

37:51.542 --> 37:52.998
That grindstone seemed

37:53.000 --> 37:54.536
like a pretty easy target...

37:59.542 --> 38:01.032
...till I tried to hit it.

38:48.583 --> 38:49.572
No!

38:50.583 --> 38:52.073
I got no choice.

39:07.083 --> 39:07.617
Please don't!

39:13.625 --> 39:15.081
Ow!

39:15.083 --> 39:17.074
Ow! Ow!

39:17.083 --> 39:19.119
Ow. Ow!

39:19.125 --> 39:20.615
That was great!

39:20.625 --> 39:22.616
You guys okay?

39:22.625 --> 39:25.116
Yeah.
How'd you blow up the shed?

39:25.125 --> 39:27.116
Well, it wasn't easy.

39:41.125 --> 39:43.116
Well, that's three less predators

39:43.667 --> 39:44.656
we have to worry about.

39:44.667 --> 39:46.123
Three?!

39:46.667 --> 39:48.123
Yeah, the guy
who shot the eagle.

39:48.125 --> 39:49.661
Troopers have his name.

39:49.667 --> 39:52.124
They're issuing a warrant
for his arrest.

39:52.667 --> 39:54.658
How's she doing?

39:54.667 --> 39:57.124
She's dead.

39:57.125 --> 40:00.162
Oh, Darin, oh.

40:00.166 --> 40:02.157
She's dead.

40:02.166 --> 40:03.656
Oh, hon.

40:03.667 --> 40:06.158
And now the whole
family'll die.

40:06.166 --> 40:07.656
Nope.

40:07.667 --> 40:09.157
What do you mean?

40:09.166 --> 40:11.657
If there's a nest,

40:11.667 --> 40:13.658
there's a chance
we can save them.

40:14.166 --> 40:16.157
You really think
there are eggs out there?

40:16.166 --> 40:19.158
If there are, I couldn't
ask for a better guide.

40:19.166 --> 40:22.158
This guy's got an
instinct for survival.

40:22.166 --> 40:25.158
Sure hope he kno
ws we're on his side.

40:25.166 --> 40:26.702
Maybe he'll lead
me to the nest.

40:26.709 --> 40:28.165
What do you think?

40:28.166 --> 40:29.702
Yeah. If the eggs are
ready to hatch.

40:29.709 --> 40:31.700
they can last four or five
days without their mother.

40:33.166 --> 40:35.703
Okay.

40:35.709 --> 40:37.700
Hey, do me a favor, will you?

40:37.709 --> 40:40.200
Signal before you turn.

40:45.208 --> 40:46.197
I better hurry.

40:46.208 --> 40:47.197
Good luck.

40:47.709 --> 40:48.698
Good luck.

41:06.750 --> 41:09.207
I don't think he'll
find that nest.

41:09.208 --> 41:12.200
It could be all the way
over in Monument Valley.

41:12.208 --> 41:13.744
Yeah, maybe you're right.

41:13.750 --> 41:17.743
But he's doing something you
and I haven't done for a while.

41:17.750 --> 41:19.240
He's trying.

41:21.250 --> 41:23.241
You know, I didn't tell you,
before, how proud I was of you;

41:23.750 --> 41:26.241
the way you
handled things today.

41:26.250 --> 41:27.239
Thanks.

42:19.291 --> 42:20.827
Monument Valley's a perfect place

42:20.834 --> 42:23.280
for golden eagles
who want to raise a family.

42:23.291 --> 42:26.283
The nest could have been
anywhere.

42:26.291 --> 42:28.282
But he led me

42:28.291 --> 42:30.828
straight to the tallest butte
of them all.

42:35.834 --> 42:37.290
Landing a hang glider

42:37.291 --> 42:40.328
on a slab of rock the size
of a coffee table isn't easy.

42:42.834 --> 42:46.326
And knowing it's a 500-foot
drop to the desert floor

42:46.834 --> 42:49.826
doesn't make it any easier.

43:49.917 --> 43:53.364
Landing and finding the eggs
was only half the job.

43:53.375 --> 43:57.914
Getting them back in one piece
was the other.

44:16.417 --> 44:18.408
No sign of him yet?

44:18.417 --> 44:20.408
Nope.

44:22.417 --> 44:25.409
Darin, this was
your grandpa's.

44:26.959 --> 44:29.951
I thought you might like it.

44:29.959 --> 44:31.415
Wow.

44:33.417 --> 44:34.953
It's almost like MacGyver's.

44:34.959 --> 44:36.415
I know.

44:41.458 --> 44:43.449
Hey, MacGyver!

44:46.458 --> 44:47.948
Did you find the nest?

44:47.959 --> 44:49.449
Uh-huh.

44:49.458 --> 44:52.450
Are there any eggs?

44:52.959 --> 44:53.948
Three of 'em.

44:53.959 --> 44:54.948
Wow.

44:54.959 --> 44:56.449
How did you do that?!

44:56.959 --> 44:58.449
Birds of a feather...

45:00.001 --> 45:00.990
The padding from this chair

45:01.001 --> 45:03.447
makes good nesting material.

45:05.001 --> 45:06.457
And vegetable oil.

45:06.458 --> 45:07.994
What does that do?

45:08.001 --> 45:08.990
The oil combines

45:09.458 --> 45:10.994
with the fibers of the padding

45:11.001 --> 45:11.990
to create a low-level

45:12.001 --> 45:13.457
spontaneous combustion.

45:13.458 --> 45:15.995
No flame... hopefully,
just the right amount of heat.

45:18.001 --> 45:19.992
Now we've got an incubator.

45:20.001 --> 45:21.491
And we wait.

45:25.500 --> 45:26.489
Darin.

45:26.500 --> 45:28.491
Hmm?
Wake up.

45:28.500 --> 45:29.489
Shh, shh, shh.

45:32.500 --> 45:33.990
They're alive.

45:37.001 --> 45:37.990
It worked.

45:38.001 --> 45:39.992
MacGyver, you saved them.

45:40.500 --> 45:43.992
I had a little help
from a friend.
