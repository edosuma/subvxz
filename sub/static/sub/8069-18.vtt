00:05.839 --> 00:09.243
[theme music]

00:54.555 --> 00:55.989
Turkey sandwich.

00:56.023 --> 00:57.658
With nothing on it?

00:57.691 --> 00:58.926
Well, there's
some turkey on it,

00:58.959 --> 01:01.829
but I bet you could
scrape it off.

01:01.862 --> 01:04.765
Their turkey's very
fresh, their chicken too.

01:04.798 --> 01:06.167
Well, you know what they say--

01:06.200 --> 01:11.272
10 years before menopause, women
go through this poultry phase.

01:11.305 --> 01:13.674
You are right, Roxanne.

01:13.707 --> 01:16.477
When I was in my
30s, I ate nothing

01:16.510 --> 01:18.912
but turkey, chicken, and tuna.

01:18.946 --> 01:21.482
I lived on tuna!

01:21.515 --> 01:25.253
Well, tuna isn't
exactly poultry,

01:25.286 --> 01:27.755
but it's very like poultry.

01:27.788 --> 01:31.992
I mean, you have to put
some kind of dressing on it,

01:32.025 --> 01:33.827
or it-- it tastes like cloth!

01:36.597 --> 01:37.598
Isn't that right, Jacques?

01:40.934 --> 01:42.636
Tossed green, lemon.

01:42.670 --> 01:43.504
Thanks.

01:43.537 --> 01:45.139
Lucky you.

01:45.173 --> 01:46.474
Didn't you order
lunch, Debbie?

01:46.507 --> 01:47.641
No.

01:47.675 --> 01:50.444
My eating has gotten
completely out of control.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.946
I mean, I've been having
breakfast, then lunch,

01:52.980 --> 01:54.215
and then I have dinner.

01:54.248 --> 01:58.252
Well, you just
described my morning.

01:58.286 --> 02:01.722
You know, Roseanne, you
have such a pretty face.

02:01.755 --> 02:04.825
It's a shame you keep it hidden
by all that extra weight.

02:04.858 --> 02:07.127
CRYSTAL: [chuckles]
Rosanne doesn't have

02:07.161 --> 02:08.629
to worry about keeping slim.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.598
Dan's crazy about her
no matter how she looks.

02:15.369 --> 02:16.170
Thanks, Crystal.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.841
Oh, I'm sorry, Roseanne.

02:20.874 --> 02:23.211
I-- I-- I didn't mean
for it to sound like--

02:23.244 --> 02:26.914
uh, well, it's-- it's just she's
so happily married, and-- and--

02:26.947 --> 02:31.619
well-- you're just not on the
market anymore, is all I meant.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.986
No, Crystal, you're right.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.588
I do need to lose weight.

02:34.622 --> 02:35.956
And I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

02:35.989 --> 02:39.927
I'm gonna start now by picking
a day next week to go on a diet.

02:39.960 --> 02:40.828
All right.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.100
Next's bad.

02:52.973 --> 02:53.774
March is out.

03:06.287 --> 03:09.657
[groans] I must've put
these pants in the dryer!

03:13.227 --> 03:14.194
What's the matter with you?

03:14.228 --> 03:16.497
My pants shrank.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.399
How dare they!

03:18.432 --> 03:19.800
Ooh.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.168
I guess they didn't shrink.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.337
I just grew.

03:23.371 --> 03:24.805
I think we've
grown together, oh.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.443
We've gotta go on a diet.

03:29.477 --> 03:30.344
What's this we jazz?

03:30.378 --> 03:31.312
My pants fit fine.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.350
Well, my pants don't fit me.

03:36.384 --> 03:40.053
Well, your pants
don't fit me either.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.088
Ha, ha, ha, Dan.

03:41.121 --> 03:44.858
Let's burn the weight
off with humor.

03:44.892 --> 03:45.926
Look at yourself.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.728
You are too fat!

03:47.761 --> 03:50.831
You've gotta go on a diet.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.065
You go on a diet.

03:52.099 --> 03:54.935
I'm going to dinner.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.304
You've gotta move, Deej.

03:56.337 --> 03:57.671
Make me.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.907
How about a kiss, hot stuff?

03:59.940 --> 04:01.909
I'm out of here!

04:01.942 --> 04:02.910
Wash your hands.

04:02.943 --> 04:07.047
A little sugar free, my pet?

04:07.080 --> 04:08.916
I'm serious, Dan.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.419
We shouldn't be eating
all this fried stuff.

04:11.452 --> 04:12.886
You guys going
on a diet again?

04:12.920 --> 04:13.787
No!

04:13.821 --> 04:15.155
Yes.

04:15.188 --> 04:16.324
So I guess this
means we're gonna

04:16.357 --> 04:17.491
have roast chicken
for three nights

04:17.525 --> 04:20.328
and then get back to reality.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.495
I mean, we're
gonna look better,

04:21.529 --> 04:22.796
and we're gonna feel better.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.599
We won't eat better.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.768
You know how we
hate being like this.

04:27.801 --> 04:28.802
Hey, Roseanne, you know what?

04:28.836 --> 04:30.438
We don't go out a lot.

04:30.471 --> 04:31.739
We don't have a big house.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.807
What's the one
luxury we can afford?

04:33.841 --> 04:36.644
Well, food ain't supposed
to be a luxury, Dan.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.011
I mean, it's supposed
to keep you alive.

04:38.045 --> 04:41.915
It ain't supposed to
provide entertainment value.

04:41.949 --> 04:42.983
What do you guys think?

04:43.016 --> 04:44.151
You think your mom
needs to lose weight?

04:44.184 --> 04:45.819
No, I like you mushy.

04:48.889 --> 04:51.759
You could stand
to lose a few, Mom.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.461
I didn't ask you.

04:53.494 --> 04:54.862
I know, Dad did.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.797
Well, your dad
really shouldn't talk.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.866
Ugh, men are supposed
to get heavy when

04:58.899 --> 04:59.967
they get older, they all do.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.340
But it doesn't
look good on women.

05:06.374 --> 05:09.242
Well, that is about the
dumbest thing you've ever said.

05:09.276 --> 05:10.310
Aw, face it.

05:10.344 --> 05:11.178
You're both tanks.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.285
Hey, you stay out of this!

05:18.318 --> 05:22.322
It's your fault I got
fat in the first place.

05:22.356 --> 05:25.959
Oh, right, like I invented
double Dutch chocolate.

05:25.993 --> 05:29.196
No, but I gained 20
pounds with that pregnancy.

05:29.229 --> 05:31.599
Me too.

05:31.632 --> 05:34.334
20 pounds?

05:34.368 --> 05:37.671
OK, 40 pounds, with each kid.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.239
Me too.

05:39.272 --> 05:42.309
Remember when I was
thin and beautiful?

05:42.342 --> 05:43.644
Honey, you're still beautiful.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.546
You've had three beautiful kids.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.848
[soda cans popping open]

05:50.784 --> 05:54.187
Well, I can't use that
as an excuse forever.

05:54.221 --> 05:55.456
Sure, you can.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.425
No, I can't use that
forever-- a couple more years,

05:57.458 --> 05:59.460
max, but not forever.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.529
Besides, I'm going
on a diet, Dan.

06:01.562 --> 06:02.596
I'm starting right now.

06:02.630 --> 06:03.797
Go.

06:03.831 --> 06:04.765
I'll be here when you get back.

06:08.168 --> 06:11.439
This whole family has got to
start eating better, I swear.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.173
That's 'cause I'm gonna
start shopping better.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.242
'Cause the whole
place is full of junk.

06:15.275 --> 06:20.347
Look at this-- chips,
pretzels, macaroni and cheese.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.649
Ohh, we got Mallomars.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.121
Kitchen's full of junk.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.457
Kids have got to eat.

06:29.490 --> 06:30.991
Yeah, but we don't
have to eat junk.

06:31.024 --> 06:31.892
Yeah, we do.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.761
We need junk.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.863
Dan, look at yourself.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.965
Hey!

06:37.998 --> 06:41.502
I get more exercise in one day
than most guys do in a week.

06:41.535 --> 06:42.936
I'm out there
haulin' and luggin'

06:42.970 --> 06:44.905
and pushing and shoving.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.007
I've got great muscle
tone under here.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.542
Feel that python.

06:48.576 --> 06:49.409
Buff.

06:49.443 --> 06:50.377
Feel right there.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.979
I don't want to
feel right there.

06:52.012 --> 06:55.315
I thought I'd get rid
of some of this junk.

06:55.348 --> 06:56.349
She's flipped out.

06:56.383 --> 06:57.485
Hose her down.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.386
Listen, just because
your pants are tight

06:59.419 --> 07:00.654
one day doesn't mean
we're gonna throw

07:00.688 --> 07:02.355
away $40 worth of groceries.

07:02.389 --> 07:05.092
Well, hey, drastic times are
gonna call for drastic measures

07:05.125 --> 07:06.059
here.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.461
I mean, I can
hardly go on a diet

07:07.495 --> 07:10.330
having to look at all this
horrible, hideous, yet

07:10.363 --> 07:11.398
delicious food.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.700
Here.

07:12.733 --> 07:15.035
Out of sight, out of mind.

07:26.313 --> 07:27.481
All right, thank you.

07:27.515 --> 07:28.682
Yeah.

07:28.716 --> 07:30.417
Now I'm gonna fix myself
something good to eat.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.427
I believe what you're
looking for is in that cabinet.

07:43.764 --> 07:46.534
ROSEANNE: Yeah, I think I did
pretty good today, you know.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.502
I had like a really
light breakfast

07:48.536 --> 07:49.903
and then a really little lunch.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.304
Then I had this diet soda.

07:51.338 --> 07:53.473
Then I had some of these carrot
sticks at Debbie's, you know,

07:53.507 --> 07:56.844
for a snack, and then
a really little dinner.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.345
That's it?

07:58.378 --> 07:59.913
ROSEANNE: That's it.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.448
You did real good, babe.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.716
I did do good.

08:02.750 --> 08:03.617
How'd you do?

08:03.651 --> 08:07.287
I didn't have anything.

08:07.320 --> 08:11.024
Dan, you had a great big
hunk of meatloaf for dinner.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.325
I only ate half that meatloaf.

08:12.359 --> 08:13.393
I threw the rest in the garbage.

08:13.426 --> 08:14.361
Dan.

08:14.394 --> 08:18.031
That's half my
dinner in the trash.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.132
All right.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.034
How many sandwiches
did you have for lunch?

08:21.068 --> 08:23.003
DAN: I had two, but it was
that sliced chicken, remember?

08:27.575 --> 08:29.509
Did you have that diet shake?

08:29.543 --> 08:32.279
And I had a shake.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.547
- Diet shake?
- I had a shake.

08:33.581 --> 08:34.615
The diet shake?

08:34.648 --> 08:36.617
(YELLING) It was a
chocolate shake, OK?

08:36.650 --> 08:38.886
I need a little sugar
in the afternoon.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.291
All right, I
guess you did good.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.258
We both did good.

08:48.696 --> 08:49.496
Yeah.

08:52.700 --> 08:56.403
You know, and as my reward
for doing good, boy,

08:56.436 --> 09:01.541
I am gonna go in there and take
a nice, long hot, private bath.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.911
Boy, I would love to get
10 minutes all to myself.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.245
And you deserve all 10.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.780
I'll stay guard
against all intruders.

09:06.814 --> 09:07.681
[phone ringing]

09:07.715 --> 09:09.049
Oh, that's probably sis.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.350
You just go in
there, take your bath,

09:10.383 --> 09:11.785
and I'll tell her to
call you right back.

09:11.819 --> 09:13.053
Oh, OK.
Thanks, honey.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.488
[phone ringing]

09:22.062 --> 09:22.963
10 minutes.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.908
[water running]

09:37.745 --> 09:38.946
Yeah, Jackie, I'll tell her.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.881
Yeah, Jackie.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.850
Uh-huh.

09:42.883 --> 09:45.285
Uh-huh.

09:45.318 --> 09:47.254
Uh-huh.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.690
Uh-huh.

09:49.723 --> 09:50.658
Yeah, Jackie.

09:50.691 --> 09:51.558
Uh-huh.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.793
Yeah, Jackie.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.762
Yeah, Jackie.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.664
Uh-huh.

09:56.697 --> 09:57.597
Uh-huh.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.066
Yep, no, no.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.201
No, no, no, no, no.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.269
It's just a small grease fire.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.637
Yeah.
Ooh!

10:03.671 --> 10:04.537
[coughs] It's out.

10:04.571 --> 10:05.873
It's out.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.307
Yeah, baking soda.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.810
Uh-huh.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.879
Uh-huh.

10:11.912 --> 10:12.713
Uh-huh.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.449
Jackie, oh!
Jack, I've gotta go.

10:16.483 --> 10:20.253
DJ hurt himself.
Yeah, talk to you later.

10:20.287 --> 10:23.390
Ha Uh-huh.

10:23.423 --> 10:24.925
Uh-huh.

10:24.958 --> 10:29.863
[laughs] Oh, Jackie,
you-- you're the nuttiest.

10:29.897 --> 10:30.831
Mm!

10:30.864 --> 10:32.265
Mm!

10:32.299 --> 10:34.334
Mhm!

10:34.367 --> 10:36.303
Mhm!

10:36.336 --> 10:39.272
Well, look at you!

10:39.306 --> 10:41.208
Gotta go!

10:41.241 --> 10:42.810
I don't believe it.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.511
The very first week you
agree to go on a diet,

10:44.544 --> 10:46.179
I catch you cheating.

10:46.213 --> 10:47.147
Excuse me.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.716
You agreed to go on a diet.

10:48.749 --> 10:49.616
Oh!

10:49.649 --> 10:50.450
Oh!

10:55.022 --> 10:56.356
[grunts]

10:59.392 --> 11:02.763
Oh, ice cream headache,
brain freeze, huh?

11:02.796 --> 11:04.064
Well, you deserve it!

11:04.097 --> 11:07.367
You go have some warm tap water.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.802
I don't even believe you, Dan.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.303
You did say you'd
do this with me.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.772
You said that, and
try to deny it.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.106
[wincing]

11:13.140 --> 11:14.875
And you were cheatin' just
then too, weren't you, Dan?

11:14.908 --> 11:16.676
So don't try to
deny that either.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.045
You did say we'd go on a diet.

11:18.078 --> 11:21.014
And if we are gonna diet, I
say, let's stick to the diet.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.683
Eating potato chips isn't
gonna help anything.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.719
Who's eating potato chips?

11:25.753 --> 11:26.720
What?

11:26.754 --> 11:27.620
You said potato chips.

11:27.654 --> 11:29.723
Who's eating potato chips?

11:29.757 --> 11:31.224
Well, I meant ice cream.

11:31.258 --> 11:33.393
Yeah, but you
said potato chips.

11:33.426 --> 11:35.095
Oh, I can't even
believe you, Dan.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.597
Don't you try to turn
this thing around on me.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.599
I want to see what's going
on in this bathroom here.

11:46.473 --> 11:47.941
Roseanne, you're still
not eating anything.

11:47.975 --> 11:50.043
No.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.678
You sure?

11:51.711 --> 11:53.080
Yeah.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.514
I'm not even hungry.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.649
Well, you have
to eat something.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.251
How about a bran muffin?

11:58.285 --> 12:01.054
No, no, I've been
good for a week now.

12:01.088 --> 12:04.091
One One little muffin's
not going to hurt you.

12:04.124 --> 12:08.561
Arthur ate bran every
day of his life.

12:08.595 --> 12:13.400
So I bet he had a
pretty clean colon.

12:13.433 --> 12:14.935
Yes, he did it.

12:14.968 --> 12:15.969
I like that in a man.

12:18.839 --> 12:22.409
Now, I know you're trying
to be careful, but--

12:22.442 --> 12:24.277
You're the one that
told me I shouldn't hide

12:24.311 --> 12:26.046
under all the extra weight.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.114
Well, of course, I did.

12:27.147 --> 12:30.650
But you can't starve
yourself, Roseanne.

12:30.683 --> 12:32.085
Maybe just a half.

12:32.119 --> 12:32.986
That's right.

12:33.020 --> 12:35.755
You need to keep your energy up.

12:35.789 --> 12:36.890
I'm not even hungry.

12:36.924 --> 12:39.059
I don't even know why
I'm eating this thing.

12:39.092 --> 12:39.893
Have it.

12:42.762 --> 12:46.967
You know, when I need to
lose a few inches, I exercise.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.068
Yeah, it's the best.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.270
When I exercise,
I get so relaxed.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.840
It's like I actually zone out.

12:52.873 --> 12:55.675
You, zone out?

12:55.708 --> 12:57.344
No, really.

12:57.377 --> 13:01.381
I do stretching first then 20
minutes of low impact aerobics

13:01.414 --> 13:03.650
to get my heart rate
up, then a half hour

13:03.683 --> 13:05.919
of toning on my problem zones.

13:05.953 --> 13:08.956
It's really made a
difference in my life.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.091
You know what's
great exercise?

13:11.124 --> 13:16.196
Dodging machine
gunfire on the beach.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.665
Yeah, 'cause, you know, you
get all sweaty, then you can

13:18.698 --> 13:20.800
just dive right into the ocean.

13:20.834 --> 13:21.701
I know.

13:21.734 --> 13:23.170
It's so refreshing.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.839
Hey, Iris, how come
you're all the time

13:25.873 --> 13:29.309
making all these like demented
comments about being blown away

13:29.342 --> 13:30.911
and stuff?

13:30.944 --> 13:31.811
The truth?

13:31.845 --> 13:34.214
Yeah.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.283
I'm shell shocked.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.218
Come on!

13:38.251 --> 13:39.452
Hey!

13:39.486 --> 13:42.489
I stand here all day
listening to women bellyache.

13:42.522 --> 13:45.025
It's my way of saying,
shut up or I'll turn

13:45.058 --> 13:48.896
your hair into a Banzai tree.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.798
You know, Roseanne, if
you would exercise every day

13:51.831 --> 13:53.733
and get your
metabolism going, you

13:53.766 --> 13:55.735
could eat anything you want.

13:55.768 --> 13:57.537
I could eat anything I want.

13:57.570 --> 13:58.571
Oh, that's right.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.173
You'd improve your circulation.

14:00.207 --> 14:04.311
You'd have more
energy during the day.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.079
I could eat anything I want?

14:06.113 --> 14:08.348
Half hour walk every
morning would get you

14:08.381 --> 14:09.983
into good physical condition.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.684
And help suppress
your appetite.

14:11.718 --> 14:12.852
I could eat anything I want?

14:16.156 --> 14:17.024
Jackson!

14:17.057 --> 14:18.125
Morning.

14:18.158 --> 14:19.492
Oh, they weren't in there.
What up, Jack?

14:19.526 --> 14:20.560
Hi, where's your mom?

14:20.593 --> 14:21.929
I'm supposed to give
her a ride to work.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.130
No clue.

14:23.163 --> 14:25.032
Just checked their
bedroom, and nobody's here.

14:25.065 --> 14:27.400
Ohh, probably
went out walking.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.002
Yeah, right.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.803
No, your mom said
that they were gonna

14:30.837 --> 14:32.072
start walking every morning.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.340
I think that's great.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.307
You want some toast?

14:34.341 --> 14:35.508
Yeah, thanks.
Butter?

14:35.542 --> 14:36.343
In the fridge.

14:39.379 --> 14:44.017
Aunt Jackie, how come Mom is
so heavy and you're so thin?

14:44.051 --> 14:44.851
It's genetics.

14:47.654 --> 14:48.488
BOTH: Oh my god!

14:52.392 --> 14:54.261
But it's not all genetics.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.964
You know, a lot of how much you
weigh depends on if you were

14:56.997 --> 15:00.968
a heavy kid, 'cause that's--

15:01.001 --> 15:05.905
that's when all your fat
cells are formed, you know.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.240
And then you only
have a certain number

15:07.274 --> 15:08.808
of fat cells in your body.

15:08.841 --> 15:14.181
And they either get
bigger or smaller

15:14.214 --> 15:16.849
for the rest of your life, so.

15:16.883 --> 15:18.685
But I don't think you guys
are gonna have a problem,

15:18.718 --> 15:20.553
because you're all pretty thin.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.155
But Mom wasn't
a heavy kid, you

15:22.189 --> 15:23.123
guys were both the same size.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.058
Well, it's just a theory, OK?

15:25.092 --> 15:28.128
Plus, there-- there's
also the environment

15:28.161 --> 15:30.530
and there's being
pregnant three times

15:30.563 --> 15:32.199
and having kids around you.

15:32.232 --> 15:35.768
You need to eat constantly
at all hours of the day.

15:35.802 --> 15:41.041
And there's also extra tartar
sauce on her fishsticks,

15:41.074 --> 15:43.876
and extra mayo on
her roast beef,

15:43.910 --> 15:46.446
and extra roast beef
on her kaiser roll.

15:49.882 --> 15:53.386
So basically you're
saying Mom just eats a lot.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.388
No, no.

15:55.422 --> 15:56.389
Well, yeah.

15:56.423 --> 15:57.757
Yeah.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.892
But look, she's out exercising.

15:59.926 --> 16:01.128
She's not exercising.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.096
You said she's walking.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.897
Ha.

16:04.931 --> 16:13.273
You know, a journey of 1,000
miles begins with one step.

16:16.943 --> 16:18.778
Awesome.

16:18.811 --> 16:19.679
Did you make that up?

16:19.712 --> 16:20.513
Uh-huh.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.885
[coughs]

16:26.886 --> 16:27.854
Dan, how's the walk?

16:27.887 --> 16:29.822
Great.

16:29.856 --> 16:30.890
Where are you going?

16:30.923 --> 16:31.724
Pick up your mom.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.134
ROSEANNE: You know,
ordinarily right now,

16:41.168 --> 16:42.869
I'd sure be in the
mood for something

16:42.902 --> 16:47.607
sweet, but not even interested.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.676
MAN (ON TV): Say,
when was the last time

16:49.709 --> 16:52.145
you tasted real butterscotch?

16:52.179 --> 16:55.948
Creamy, smooth,
butterscotch with walnuts,

16:55.982 --> 16:59.286
surrounded by delicious
milk chocolate?

16:59.319 --> 17:00.953
Have a Yummy Bar.

17:00.987 --> 17:01.788
You deserve it.

17:06.593 --> 17:07.527
You OK?

17:07.560 --> 17:09.862
Yeah, yeah, I'm just--

17:09.896 --> 17:10.763
I'm gonna get a--

17:10.797 --> 17:13.566
I'm gonna get a diet soda.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.768
WOMAN (ON TV): This week
only at The King's Table,

17:15.802 --> 17:17.504
our famous surf
and turf platter,

17:17.537 --> 17:20.073
which includes a 10-ounce
charbroiled filet

17:20.107 --> 17:24.811
mignon, a 10-ounce Maine
lobster tail with drawn butter,

17:24.844 --> 17:29.382
and steak fries or cream
spinach, all for only $8.99.

17:29.416 --> 17:33.553
MAN (ON TV): At Bucky Burgers,
our burgers are flame broiled.

17:33.586 --> 17:37.490
Even the bacon we put on our
cheeseburgers is flame broiled.

17:37.524 --> 17:40.193
And we use real cheese, and
all our buns are toasted.

17:40.227 --> 17:43.530
So bring the whole
family to Bucky Burgers.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.098
WOMAN (ON TV): Come on,
kids, let's all go to--

17:45.132 --> 17:46.699
I'm hungry!

17:46.733 --> 17:48.601
Where are you going?

17:48.635 --> 17:50.170
I haven't had a
[inaudible] thing in 10 days!

17:50.203 --> 17:51.271
Don't do this.
Don't do it, Roseanne.

17:51.304 --> 17:52.405
Don't do it.
- I want a cookie!

17:52.439 --> 17:53.340
Want cookie.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.242
I'll walk an extra
mile tomorrow.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.476
You hate yourself tonight!

17:56.509 --> 17:57.444
I'll walk two miles!

17:57.477 --> 17:59.979
Two miles to get
to that one cookie!

18:00.012 --> 18:01.481
Darlene, where's
those Mallomars?

18:01.514 --> 18:02.949
DARLENE: Freezer.

18:02.982 --> 18:04.984
[laughs maniacally]

18:05.985 --> 18:07.454
Mmm!

18:07.487 --> 18:09.989
I thought you said one.

18:10.022 --> 18:11.524
I got one for you.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.326
I don't want it,
and neither do you.

18:13.360 --> 18:14.794
Oh, yes I do, Dan!

18:14.827 --> 18:15.795
I do!

18:15.828 --> 18:16.796
Trust me, I do!

18:16.829 --> 18:17.630
Roseanne!

18:20.133 --> 18:24.036
Now, nobody said this was gonna
be easy, and it's not gonna be.

18:24.070 --> 18:25.572
Food's a tough thing to beat.
It's everywhere.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.106
You can hear it.
You can smell it.

18:27.140 --> 18:30.042
Hell, if you want
to, you can taste it.

18:30.076 --> 18:33.313
But, when that big
calorie counter in the sky

18:33.346 --> 18:36.949
looks down in his book, I
want us to do him proud.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.485
Ah!

18:38.518 --> 18:39.386
[patriotic music playing]

18:39.419 --> 18:40.953
There's gonna be calories.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.389
There's gonna be carbohydrates.

18:42.422 --> 18:46.259
But it's our job to keep them
down, push back, hold them

18:46.293 --> 18:47.294
to three, and force a turnover.

18:47.327 --> 18:48.628
But we can't eat turnovers!

18:48.661 --> 18:50.163
We can't eat have Pop-Tarts!

18:50.197 --> 18:51.431
We've gotta say.
We're gotta say.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.065
We're gonna stick
and move, move, move!

18:53.099 --> 18:54.634
We're the underdogs
in this game, see?

18:54.667 --> 18:56.403
But right now,
we're winning, see?

18:56.436 --> 19:00.407
You'll remember, the final
score, it's up to us.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.074
It's up to us.

19:02.108 --> 19:03.743
It's up--

19:03.776 --> 19:05.545
Well, that was
very inspiring, Dan.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.483
Now give me those cookies!

19:10.517 --> 19:12.419
Becky!

19:12.452 --> 19:16.789
Becky, call
[inaudible] next door!

19:16.823 --> 19:19.426
Well, I put it back, coach.

19:19.459 --> 19:21.628
Way to go, 37.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.864
I didn't eat nothing.

19:24.897 --> 19:29.068
[sighs] Boy, but, I could
sure go for seeing that Bucky

19:29.101 --> 19:29.936
Burger commercial again.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.712
You guys were
walking for an hour.

19:39.746 --> 19:43.015
The Olympics are
only two years away.

19:43.049 --> 19:44.717
Then you still have time.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.386
What event?

19:46.419 --> 19:47.220
Child throwing.

19:50.923 --> 19:53.293
Maybe I should start getting
up and walking with you guys.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.193
Me too.

19:54.227 --> 19:56.796
No, no, these
walks are private.

19:56.829 --> 20:00.900
Ooh, did you guys make
out while you're walking?

20:00.933 --> 20:01.868
ROSEANNE: Dan!

20:01.901 --> 20:02.835
What?

20:02.869 --> 20:03.836
They fit!

20:03.870 --> 20:04.804
They fit!

20:04.837 --> 20:05.772
DAN: Hey!

20:05.805 --> 20:07.640
[clapping]

20:10.176 --> 20:13.179
Now let me try 'em on.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.414
You know, I am so happy.

20:14.447 --> 20:15.448
I mean, I know--

20:15.482 --> 20:16.449
I get it.

20:16.483 --> 20:17.650
It's not that much
or nothing, but--

20:17.684 --> 20:19.118
I mean, it's just a small thing.

20:19.151 --> 20:22.455
But my pants fit, and I mean,
I feel really good about it.

20:22.489 --> 20:24.457
But you know, if I
could do this good,

20:24.491 --> 20:25.825
maybe I can do even better.

20:25.858 --> 20:28.895
I mean, maybe we really
can exercise every day.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.763
And maybe I really can
lose some more weight.

20:30.797 --> 20:31.964
I feel great!

20:31.998 --> 20:33.065
That's great, babe.

20:33.099 --> 20:34.000
You know, I have time.

20:34.033 --> 20:34.901
You know what I'm gonna do?

20:34.934 --> 20:35.802
What?

20:35.835 --> 20:37.103
I'm gonna walk to work.

20:37.136 --> 20:38.771
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm serious.

20:38.805 --> 20:39.872
I'm really walking to work.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.074
I think it's about 2
and 1/2 miles, right?

20:42.108 --> 20:44.243
And we probably walked farther
than that this morning.

20:44.277 --> 20:45.645
Easy.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.947
Yeah, and then maybe I could,
like, walk home from work too.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.349
And I could do that every day.

20:49.382 --> 20:52.352
And that would be like, OK, say
like an extra five miles a day.

20:52.385 --> 20:53.686
Go for it!

20:53.720 --> 20:55.121
I'm gonna do it.

20:55.154 --> 20:56.656
I'll see you guys later.
- Bye, Mom.

20:56.689 --> 20:57.757
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, honey.

20:57.790 --> 20:58.625
DJ: Bye!

20:58.658 --> 21:00.059
Bye, Mommy.

21:00.092 --> 21:00.960
That's great.

21:00.993 --> 21:01.861
That is really great.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.763
I'm really proud of your mom.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.498
Ooh, it's like 13
degrees out there.

21:05.532 --> 21:06.333
I'm not walking in.

21:11.771 --> 21:17.810
3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.

21:17.844 --> 21:18.845
MALE WORKOUT INSTRUCTOR: Chest.

21:18.878 --> 21:19.812
1, 2--

21:19.846 --> 21:20.813
MALE WORKOUT INSTRUCTOR: Back.

21:20.847 --> 21:21.714
2, 3--

21:21.748 --> 21:22.749
MALE WORKOUT INSTRUCTOR: Torso.

21:22.782 --> 21:23.783
4.

21:23.816 --> 21:28.988
1, 2, 3, 4.

21:29.021 --> 21:32.825
1, 2, 3, 4.

21:32.859 --> 21:33.726
And 1--

21:33.760 --> 21:34.627
And two more.

21:34.661 --> 21:37.830
2, 3, 4.

21:37.864 --> 21:40.232
Together, apart.

21:40.266 --> 21:44.003
Down and up Together, apart.

21:44.036 --> 21:45.237
And finish.

21:45.271 --> 21:46.339
See, you did feel them, right?

21:46.373 --> 21:47.239
Oh.

21:47.273 --> 21:48.140
Yes.

21:48.174 --> 21:50.543
I can't move.
