# I know I am, I'm sure I am
I'm West Ham till I die #

00:40.807 --> 00:43.799
[shouting]

00:45.487 --> 00:48.240
Go on, bruv. Go on, bruv.

00:53.247 --> 00:59.436
Fuck me. If I knew we was going to a bar
mitzvah, I'd have brought me fucking skullcap.

00:59.607 --> 01:04.556
Mate, Tottenham's due north.
Are you lost or just fucking stupid?

01:04.727 --> 01:08.436
Still a stand-up comedian, eh, Dunham?
All right, mate.

01:08.607 --> 01:11.917
When the Major was doing your job,
he wasn't nearly so chatty.

01:12.087 --> 01:15.045
Probably 'cause
he wasn't quite so nervous either.

01:15.207 --> 01:18.438
The Major always preferred a scrap
to your yammer.

01:18.607 --> 01:20.916
- What's all that? What is that?
- Yammer?

01:21.087 --> 01:26.445
You reckon? Mate, I think you should get
on the next train and fuck off out of here.

01:26.607 --> 01:29.724
- Before something bad happens.
- [Jeering]

01:29.887 --> 01:32.401
We'd be interested to see exactly what that is.

01:32.567 --> 01:35.604
You're not exactly top-flight mob
these days, are you?

01:35.767 --> 01:38.201
- More like a two-bob mob.
- [Laughter]

01:38.367 --> 01:40.961
See, now, that's just plain rude.

01:41.127 --> 01:44.483
But if you fancy it, who are we to let you down?

01:44.647 --> 01:49.641
- Come on, then!
- Come on, then, you fucking poncey cunt!

01:49.807 --> 01:53.277
- You fucking cunt! You!
- [Chanting]

02:08.607 --> 02:10.279
Fucking have it! Come on.

03:05.647 --> 03:07.638
Let's go.

03:08.727 --> 03:11.082
I'm telling you, you don't need Lewis.

03:11.247 --> 03:18.005
I will trade you Keeshon and Maddux for Lewis.
And I'm gonna be losing out on this deal.

03:18.167 --> 03:22.797
Because Keeshon, he's back
with the old coach. He's back with Parcells.

03:22.967 --> 03:25.686
And they are gonna be an unstoppable team.

03:25.847 --> 03:28.236
You know that. I know that.

03:30.647 --> 03:34.196
Look, man, he was
comeback player of the year, you know.

03:34.367 --> 03:39.077
Not many guys have thrown
over 6,000 yards. Come on.

03:42.487 --> 03:45.684
Let me call you back.
I gotta deal with something.

03:48.327 --> 03:53.720
Buckner. That $10,000.
I think it's a pretty good deal.

03:53.887 --> 03:56.606
We never had a deal, Jeremy.

03:59.847 --> 04:02.520
Look, I know you got screwed here.

04:02.687 --> 04:06.316
But I have my family's reputation to protect.

04:06.487 --> 04:10.924
A Van Holden getting expelled from Harvard.
No way.

04:11.087 --> 04:13.476
I've got a little more at stake here, Matt.

04:14.527 --> 04:16.836
Buckner.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.077
Come on, man.

04:19.247 --> 04:25.004
My dad is definitely gonna get re-elected.
When I graduate, I'll totally hook you up.

04:28.207 --> 04:30.198
Thanks, bro.

04:37.607 --> 04:39.996
You're really saving my ass.

05:11.687 --> 05:16.283
You've reached Carl Buckner. I'm currently
on assignment in Kabul and I'm unreachable.

05:16.447 --> 05:18.597
Leave a message
at the foreign correspondents desk

05:18.767 --> 05:23.557
at the Washington bureau of the Times
and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.

05:23.727 --> 05:25.718
Thanks so much.

06:04.727 --> 06:08.163
This is a security announcement
at Heathrow airport.

06:08.327 --> 06:12.525
Please keep your belongings with you
at all times.

06:12.687 --> 06:14.678
[Matt] My name is Matt Buckner.

06:14.847 --> 06:18.681
Last spring, I got kicked out of Harvard
two months shy of my diploma,

06:18.847 --> 06:23.318
but what I was about to learn, no lvy League
school in the world could teach me.

07:44.727 --> 07:49.562
Mind the gap.
Please stand clear of the closing doors.

07:49.727 --> 07:52.685
Mind the gap. Please stand clear.

08:10.007 --> 08:12.157
[Woman] Matt!

08:14.887 --> 08:17.003
- Hi. Hey.
- Hey.

08:17.167 --> 08:19.556
- Oh, my God.
- It's so good to see you.

08:19.727 --> 08:22.924
You, too. Was that a terrorist attack?
What happened here?

08:23.087 --> 08:26.397
Welcome to match-day madness.
Tottenham was in town last night.

08:26.567 --> 08:30.037
- Are you a soccer fan now?
- Don't let them hear you say soccer.

08:30.207 --> 08:32.640
- Who's "them"?
- The British Empire.

08:33.687 --> 08:36.326
Uncle Matt, meet Ben.

08:36.486 --> 08:39.047
- Can you believe that?
- Hey there, little guy.

08:39.207 --> 08:41.515
- He's adorable.
- Yeah.

08:42.767 --> 08:46.726
It is so good to see you.
But what are you doing here?

08:51.327 --> 08:57.357
It doesn't make sense. Why would you have
been expelled if you didn't do anything wrong?

08:57.527 --> 09:00.280
It was my roommate. He's a total cokehead.

09:00.447 --> 09:04.599
Somebody tipped off campus security
and we got our room searched.

09:04.767 --> 09:06.758
They found his stash in my stuff.

09:06.927 --> 09:10.840
I guess he'd been hiding his shit
in my closet the entire time.

09:11.007 --> 09:13.475
Really?

09:13.647 --> 09:17.606
- Yeah, really.
- You could tell me if you were taking...

09:17.767 --> 09:22.158
- It's not like that.
- So you fought it and they didn't believe you?

09:22.327 --> 09:25.876
Matt. You fought it, right?

09:26.927 --> 09:29.487
Look, you don't know who this guy is.

09:29.647 --> 09:31.683
He's a Van Holden.

09:31.847 --> 09:34.839
I wouldn't have even had a chance.

09:36.207 --> 09:38.801
So what did Dad say?

09:38.967 --> 09:40.446
"You've reached Carl Buckner."

09:40.607 --> 09:43.519
"I'll be in the lvory Coast for 57 years"?

09:43.687 --> 09:46.326
- Kabul this time.
- Whatever.

09:46.487 --> 09:50.241
Seriously, though, when you spoke to him,
what did he say?

09:50.407 --> 09:53.285
- I didn't tell him.
- He doesn't know?

09:55.007 --> 09:59.683
- I probably would have done the same thing.
- Yeah?

09:59.847 --> 10:03.078
Once he finds out his golden boy
got kicked out of Harvard,

10:03.247 --> 10:05.636
he'll dive headfirst
into an empty swimming pool.

10:05.807 --> 10:08.037
- Gee, thanks.
- [Car door closes]

10:08.207 --> 10:11.836
Oh, Steve's home.

10:12.007 --> 10:13.998
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

10:16.807 --> 10:21.005
- I've got a surprise for you.
- Oh, honey, we have a guest.

10:21.167 --> 10:24.125
This is my kid brother, Matt.

10:24.287 --> 10:26.721
Matt. All right, mate? How are you doing?

10:26.887 --> 10:31.005
- It's good to finally meet you.
- And you. Finally made it across the pond?

10:31.167 --> 10:33.158
- Yeah.
- [Baby gurgles]

10:33.327 --> 10:35.795
Who's this? Who's this?

10:35.967 --> 10:38.356
Come here. Oh, I missed you. Come here.

10:38.527 --> 10:40.438
Oh!

10:40.607 --> 10:44.316
- I missed you, little Lord Ben.
- Honey, you want some tea?

10:44.487 --> 10:46.523
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Tea, huh?

10:46.687 --> 10:50.202
- Get over it.
- He's a good-looking little geezer, in't he?

10:50.367 --> 10:52.403
- Sure is.
- Listen, Matt.

10:52.567 --> 10:56.037
I'm really pleased you're here,
but I made some plans for tonight.

10:56.207 --> 10:58.323
I've got this whole romantic evening set up.

10:58.487 --> 11:01.763
I've got the babysitter booked,
and we've got tickets to see Chicago.

11:01.927 --> 11:03.918
- You wouldn't mind if we go?
- [Knocking]

11:04.087 --> 11:06.601
Oh, excuse me.

11:06.767 --> 11:11.682
Shall we go and see who's banging
the door down? What a surprise.

11:11.847 --> 11:15.157
- What are you doing?
- Aye aye! All right, bruv.

11:18.327 --> 11:21.956
- Jesus, Shannon, you look rough.
- You're a funny guy, Pete.

11:22.127 --> 11:25.403
- [Pete laughs]
- Matt, this is Pete, Steve's brother.

11:25.567 --> 11:28.161
- Pete, this is my brother, Matt.
- Hi.

11:28.327 --> 11:31.444
- All right, son?
- Good to meet you.

11:31.607 --> 11:32.835
Hello, Ben.

11:33.007 --> 11:36.795
# I'm West Ham till I die
I'm West Ham till I die

11:36.967 --> 11:39.845
- # I know I am, I'm sure I am... #
- All right.

11:40.007 --> 11:43.841
- I'm taking him to bed.
- All right, babe.

11:45.127 --> 11:47.357
- See you later, Ben.
- Well done.

11:47.527 --> 11:50.997
- I thought you were going to the match.
- Well, technically, yes.

11:51.167 --> 11:54.762
But we got into a bit of a drinking session
last night.

11:54.927 --> 11:58.078
- One thing led to another...
- You've lost your wallet.

11:58.247 --> 12:00.044
- And me keys.
- [Horn beeps]

12:00.207 --> 12:03.483
There's a taxi outside.

12:05.007 --> 12:07.919
Top bloke, my brother.

12:08.087 --> 12:09.406
So...

12:12.407 --> 12:14.967
How are we, my colonial cousin?

12:15.687 --> 12:18.918
- Fine, thanks.
- [American accent] Fine, thanks.

12:20.847 --> 12:23.919
- You couldn't make it a hundred?
- How does piss off sound?

12:24.087 --> 12:25.884
Fuck off, come on.

12:26.047 --> 12:29.164
# Get some drinks in
Get some drinks in

12:29.327 --> 12:33.002
- # Get... #
- Shut up. Just shut up.

12:34.007 --> 12:37.124
I'll tell you what I'll do, all right?

12:37.287 --> 12:40.563
I'll give you a hundred...

12:42.527 --> 12:44.916
...if you take Matt here to the match.

12:45.087 --> 12:48.124
Fuck off, you're having a bubble.

12:48.287 --> 12:51.882
- I can't take a Yank to football.
- Yeah, you can.

12:52.047 --> 12:55.642
And you're gonna be on your best behaviour,
do you understand?

12:59.527 --> 13:02.564
- Go on.
- Well, come on, then.

13:02.727 --> 13:06.322
Cheers, Matt.
We don't get much time on our own.

13:06.487 --> 13:10.878
Right, listen to me.
You don't give him the money, OK?

13:11.047 --> 13:13.322
No way. That's beer for the boys.

13:13.487 --> 13:16.240
- All right.
- All right?

13:16.407 --> 13:18.841
Matt? Where are you going?

13:19.007 --> 13:21.805
I'm going to the soccer game with Pete.

13:21.967 --> 13:25.880
- But you just got here.
- I know, but I'll catch up with you later.

13:26.047 --> 13:29.357
- Have a good time. See you.
- [Pete] Hurry up.

13:29.527 --> 13:32.599
I don't want him hanging out
with Pete and those thugs.

13:32.767 --> 13:35.964
It's all right. He's a big boy.
He can look after himself.

13:36.127 --> 13:38.766
Pick a hand. Come on.

13:41.727 --> 13:44.799
The right hand?
You've just won the star prize.

13:49.407 --> 13:53.400
Yeah? How much do you love me?

13:53.567 --> 13:55.478
- A lot.
- That's not enough.

14:01.967 --> 14:07.599
I'm not being funny, but the last thing
I want to do is to take you to the match.

14:07.767 --> 14:12.318
So here's how it works.
Give me half the money. I'll go to football.

14:12.487 --> 14:17.845
You can see where Churchill took a tom,
or whatever you Yanks do in Jolly Old.

14:18.007 --> 14:22.319
- Tom?
- Tom. A tomtit, shit.

14:22.487 --> 14:26.082
It's rhyming slang.
Like bees and honey for money.

14:26.247 --> 14:29.683
Like I could say to you,
give me the fucking bees.

14:29.847 --> 14:35.319
- I made a promise to Steve.
- Well, Steve ain't here, is he, mate? I am.

14:35.487 --> 14:38.763
You're pissing in the wind
if you think I'm taking you.

14:38.927 --> 14:43.443
- I'm not giving you the money.
- You ain't really got a fucking choice, mate.

14:43.607 --> 14:47.600
And you're starting to get on my tits.
Give me half the money.

14:49.487 --> 14:51.478
Cops!

14:53.127 --> 14:55.766
Well, how fucking stupid do you feel now?

14:55.927 --> 14:59.158
Come on, then, dance for me, Yankee.

15:02.207 --> 15:05.165
Serves you right
for fighting like a bleeding tart.

15:05.327 --> 15:09.445
But try that again
and I will kick the shit out of you.

15:09.607 --> 15:12.326
Yeah, the tom out of me. I get it.

15:12.487 --> 15:14.478
Get up. Come on.

15:15.687 --> 15:18.440
So, I'm guessing you're not much of a fighter.

15:18.607 --> 15:21.121
Fighter? That's probably
the first fight I ever had.

15:21.287 --> 15:24.245
You call that a fight?

15:25.887 --> 15:30.039
Fuck it. I will take you with me.
You might learn something.

15:30.207 --> 15:34.962
- About soccer?
- No, mate. Not about soccer.

15:35.127 --> 15:38.756
And for fuck's sake, stop saying soccer.

15:40.487 --> 15:42.796
Come on, hurry up.

15:45.447 --> 15:48.086
What are you talking about,
baseball is a girls' game?

15:48.247 --> 15:51.478
The Red Sox guy pitches a ball
at 90 miles an hour.

15:51.647 --> 15:55.481
Who cares? All that means is
he can have a wank faster than you.

15:55.647 --> 15:57.842
- Come on.
- Think about it.

15:59.687 --> 16:03.362
I just don't get it.
What is it with you Americans?

16:03.527 --> 16:08.237
You start a fucking war, bottle it,
then we have to come save your arse again.

16:08.407 --> 16:10.477
- Save our ass?
- Yes.

16:10.647 --> 16:14.356
On top of that, you kill half our soldiers
in friendly fire.

16:14.527 --> 16:18.042
- That's called an accident.
- Yeah, accident my arse.

16:18.207 --> 16:20.402
- All right?
- All right, Dunham?

16:20.567 --> 16:25.721
Look, we're sort of
going into my place of business, right?

16:25.887 --> 16:29.197
Shut up and you might have
a better run of things.

16:29.367 --> 16:33.155
Only thing regarded worse than a Yank
around here are coppers and journalists.

16:33.327 --> 16:36.478
- What have you got against journalists?
- How long have you got?

16:36.647 --> 16:41.084
They're lying fucking scum
who'll write anything just to fill papers.

16:41.247 --> 16:44.683
Not your old man, of course.
He's the exception maybe.

16:44.847 --> 16:49.363
These boys don't know about your old man.
If I was you, I'd keep it that way.

16:49.527 --> 16:53.486
Another thing.
What you hear in here stays in here, all right?

16:53.647 --> 16:57.003
No blabbing to brother Steve
about who said what.

16:57.167 --> 16:59.965
What happens at football stays at football.
All right?

17:00.127 --> 17:01.924
Yeah, all right.

17:02.087 --> 17:06.126
Let's have some fun. It's football day!

17:08.727 --> 17:10.718
All right, Pete.

17:11.487 --> 17:14.479
- Aye aye!
- [Cheering]

17:14.646 --> 17:19.323
- How's it going?
- Good, yeah, good. All right, boys?

17:19.487 --> 17:21.682
This is Matt, Shannon's brother. Ned.

17:21.847 --> 17:24.361
- Nice to meet you.
- Dave. Swill.

17:24.527 --> 17:26.915
- Hello, mate.
- Ike.

17:27.087 --> 17:30.363
- And the one with the dodgy haircut's Keith.
- Hey, Keith.

17:30.527 --> 17:34.805
- I'll get the drinks in, then.
- Does that mean I'm getting the drinks in?

17:34.967 --> 17:39.165
Every fucking time. Every fucking time.

17:39.327 --> 17:42.160
- Where's Bovver?
- He's been in the toilet for 15 minutes.

17:42.327 --> 17:46.002
- Dodgy Ruby or something.
- Look, he looks lost.

17:46.167 --> 17:48.920
Ruby Murray means curry.
We call it cockney rhyming slang.

17:49.087 --> 17:52.204

battering one of Birmingham's main lads.

34:56.246 --> 34:59.842
- Here you are, love, sit down.
- Thank you.

35:00.007 --> 35:03.204
I don't know how to thank you
for what you did.

35:03.367 --> 35:06.723
Don't give it another thought.
Yesterday was a good result for us.

35:06.887 --> 35:10.436
We had a laugh, a few pints,
cheered on the mighty Hammers.

35:10.607 --> 35:12.882
We was completely outnumbered,

35:13.047 --> 35:16.881
but we stuck by our mates
and we stood our ground, no matter what.

35:17.047 --> 35:20.164
That's what it's all about.

35:29.847 --> 35:33.442
- Looking at the fucking state of him.
- Don't fucking start, all right?

35:33.607 --> 35:36.838
What did I say to you?
One simple thing: No trouble.

35:37.007 --> 35:40.522
It had nothing to do with me.
He's walking home, he gets jumped.

35:40.687 --> 35:44.043
- He's lucky we was there.
- You're a real hero, ain't you, mate?

35:44.207 --> 35:47.324
And you saw the whole thing from your sofa?

35:47.487 --> 35:50.206
Concentrate on your family
and leave my business to me.

35:50.367 --> 35:53.006
My family? What is it with you, eh?

35:53.167 --> 35:57.957
Do you want mum to visit you in the nick?
Maybe you want the plot next to dad.

35:58.127 --> 36:02.200
- Oh, my God! Matt, what happened?
- Shannon, I'm fine.

36:02.367 --> 36:05.006
Pete, can't you see
what you're doing to this family?

36:05.167 --> 36:07.920
All I see is a scared old man.

36:08.087 --> 36:11.159
- Don't talk to me like that!
- You got the wrong idea.

36:11.327 --> 36:15.559
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Stop it! Steve! Stop it!

36:15.727 --> 36:20.084
Get the fuck out! Get out! Fuck! Shit.

36:20.247 --> 36:22.203
[Baby cries]

36:23.607 --> 36:25.598
Babe, I'm so sorry.

36:29.967 --> 36:33.562
Well, that weren't the smartest of moves, mate.

36:33.727 --> 36:35.718
But thanks, yeah?

36:38.207 --> 36:40.357
- Fancy a pint?
- No.

36:40.527 --> 36:44.520
Oh, come on. You're the one
that's got to buy the bleeding thing.

36:47.767 --> 36:51.999
[Bovver] Get your cash out.
The fat bird's about to sing.

36:53.047 --> 36:55.117
Ah, shot.

36:55.287 --> 36:58.199
Jesus! You two joined
at the fucking hip or what?

36:58.367 --> 37:02.724
- Leave it out, Bov. It's getting old.
- No, I'm starting to wonder about you two.

37:02.887 --> 37:07.324
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you was a couple of gay boys.

37:09.487 --> 37:14.197
Bov, we've known each other
a long time, yeah?

37:14.367 --> 37:17.439
I trust you more than any other bloke I know.

37:17.607 --> 37:21.805
But you're getting dangerously close
to crossing the line with me.

37:21.967 --> 37:27.200
If you've got a problem,
then it's your fucking problem, not mine.

37:27.367 --> 37:30.882
But if you want to discuss it further,
we can go outside.

37:31.047 --> 37:35.962
- Beers, boys.
- Hey, Bov. It's your shot, mate.

37:36.127 --> 37:40.484
Come on. Let's crack on with the game.

37:40.647 --> 37:44.720
[Barman] Pete. Everything all right, mate?

37:50.487 --> 37:54.162
I can't believe you came all this way
and didn't even stay the night.

37:54.327 --> 37:58.081
- I don't want to mess anything else up.
- You didn't mess anything up.

37:58.247 --> 38:02.240
- So you and Steve are OK?
- Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

38:02.407 --> 38:05.205
All right, well, I'll call you from Pete's.

38:09.807 --> 38:13.163
Matt. Please don't go.

38:14.407 --> 38:16.682
Steve feels so horrible about what happened

38:16.847 --> 38:21.079
and he really wants you to stay with us,
and so do I.

38:21.247 --> 38:25.479
- I don't want you to stay with Pete.
- Well, I wanna stay with Pete.

38:26.767 --> 38:29.076
Pete and his thug friends aren't the answer.

38:30.727 --> 38:33.924
What are you talking about? What answer?

38:36.367 --> 38:40.280
I've been begging you to come and visit me
for the last three years

38:40.447 --> 38:43.041
and you didn't even come to my wedding and...

38:43.207 --> 38:45.721
You don't know my husband,
haven't held your nephew,

38:45.887 --> 38:49.118
and you show up on my doorstep yesterday
and you're leaving already.

38:49.287 --> 38:53.075
Look who's talking. You ran
to another fucking country after Mom died.

39:01.887 --> 39:03.684
I'm sorry.

39:08.687 --> 39:11.724
- You come and visit me.
- Yeah, of course.

39:19.687 --> 39:22.247
[Pete] Jeremy Van Holden?

39:23.487 --> 39:25.876
Sounds like a cunt.

39:26.047 --> 39:31.360
Mate, if he'd done that to me,
I'd smash seven shades of shit out of him.

39:33.527 --> 39:36.997
Sounds like these Harvard boys
would slit your throat in your sleep.

39:37.167 --> 39:41.763
What was you studying,
before this geezer stitched you up?

39:41.927 --> 39:45.886
- History.
- History? I teach history.

39:46.047 --> 39:50.837
- You teach?
- Yes, cheeky slag.

39:51.007 --> 39:55.398
History and PE. What, did you think
the GSE paid a bloody wage?

39:55.567 --> 39:58.240
I'm smart as fuck.

39:58.407 --> 40:01.558
Come on, it's brass monkeys out here.

40:03.887 --> 40:06.799
Class, today we have
an extraordinarily distinguished guest.

40:06.967 --> 40:13.202
Mr Buckner is an American who went to the
finest university in the United States, Harvard.

40:13.367 --> 40:15.961
But despite his prestigious education,

40:16.127 --> 40:22.646
Mr Buckner still thinks that baseball
is better than football.

40:22.807 --> 40:24.798
[Boys shout]

40:24.967 --> 40:27.435
I know, boys. It's an utter sin.

40:27.607 --> 40:30.485
It's our job to save this heathen
from his evil ways

40:30.647 --> 40:33.525
and teach him what really matters in life,
and that is?

40:33.687 --> 40:37.157
- Football!
- Exactly. We're going to play five-a-side.

40:37.327 --> 40:40.603
Mr Buckner will be goalie for the away colours.

40:40.767 --> 40:44.555
Now, go easy on him, boys.
You know how these Americans bruise.

40:46.247 --> 40:48.317
[Shouting]

40:50.487 --> 40:54.002
How do we keep this fair?
I let every other ball go through?

40:54.167 --> 40:56.362
I wouldn't worry about that.

40:57.407 --> 40:59.398
All right. You ready?

41:09.007 --> 41:11.396
[Pete] Go on, son.

41:12.207 --> 41:14.243
That's it! That's it!

41:14.407 --> 41:17.160
Ah, beautiful! Beautiful!

41:18.247 --> 41:20.238
Relax, kids.

41:22.807 --> 41:27.722
[Pete] Go on, Duncan. Go on, Duncan,
have it. Take it all the way.

41:29.447 --> 41:31.722
Have it. Have a dig, mate.

41:33.047 --> 41:35.515
- [Cheering]
- [Pete] Oh, beautiful goal!

41:42.367 --> 41:44.517
All right, that's it.

41:57.407 --> 41:59.841
What was that?

42:02.167 --> 42:04.158
Go on, my son.

42:05.847 --> 42:07.883
Beautiful. Sheer beauty.

42:10.327 --> 42:14.115
- Lovely.
- [Boys shouting]

42:14.287 --> 42:16.755
[Blows whistle]

42:16.927 --> 42:21.079
All right. Home team: 10. Away team: 3.

42:21.247 --> 42:24.603
Thanks to some pathetic goalkeeping
from the away keeper.

42:24.767 --> 42:29.477
- All right, get yourselves changed, boys.
- Played.

42:29.647 --> 42:33.526
- That's what I call a real ass-whipping.
- You set me up.

42:33.687 --> 42:36.155
That was like
the junior Olympic football team, right?

42:36.327 --> 42:40.036
No, mate. Just regular English boys.
We've got history next.

42:40.207 --> 42:43.279
Say a few words about
the American War of Independence.

42:43.447 --> 42:48.646
- They'd get a kick out of a real live colonial.
- American history isn't really my specialty.

42:48.807 --> 42:51.719
Mate, they're ten.
Teach them whatever you want.

42:51.887 --> 42:55.323
Well, I sort of have plans
with Shannon this afternoon.

42:55.487 --> 42:58.559
- We'll have a beer later.
- Yeah, see you at the pub.

42:58.727 --> 43:02.003
All right, mate. Who are you? Who are you?

43:02.647 --> 43:07.721
But these kids... He set me up, man. I'm
thinking this is some class of kids, little ones.

43:07.887 --> 43:09.878
Shut up.

43:11.727 --> 43:15.606
- They're coming in everywhere...
- Oh, come on.

43:22.367 --> 43:24.722
No, no. No.

43:24.887 --> 43:26.878
[Cheering]

44:01.007 --> 44:03.646
- Fat cunt.
- Fucking fat bastard.

44:03.807 --> 44:06.879
- Hello, mate.
- Get the fucking chips in.

44:07.047 --> 44:11.040
Well, I'll be fucked.
If it ain't my old mate Bovver.

44:12.407 --> 44:14.875
How are you doing, son, all right?

44:15.047 --> 44:20.121
I'll say one thing, you got some fucking front
showing your face over this side of the water.

44:20.287 --> 44:24.519
There's plenty of people round here love to kick
your fucking arse, given half the chance.

44:24.687 --> 44:28.885
- There's four of 'em stood over there.
- Fucking right, son.

44:29.047 --> 44:34.804
So, Bov, what's all this I'm hearing about
your firm gone all fucking international, eh?

44:37.527 --> 44:42.647
Don't you even fucking think
about ignoring me, you little cunt.

44:42.807 --> 44:48.200
Now, I said what's all this bollocks I'm hearing
about you having a little Yank on the firm?

44:50.847 --> 44:54.078
It's only temporary.

44:54.247 --> 44:57.876
- Temporary, eh?
- [Chatting and laughter]

44:58.047 --> 45:03.599
Do you think I can get a bit of quiet here?
I'm trying to have a fucking conversation!

45:04.527 --> 45:07.837
- [Whispers] What's his problem?
- Shh.

45:08.007 --> 45:11.966
So, look at you, little Bovver.
All grown up now, look.

45:12.127 --> 45:14.163
- Where's your other little girl...?
- [Man] Petey.

45:14.327 --> 45:17.000
Petey? She at home, is she?

45:17.167 --> 45:22.116
Trying to get her little toes
into the Major's big fucking shoes?

45:22.287 --> 45:26.758
I guess we was pretty small back then, son.
Back in your day.

45:30.567 --> 45:33.718
You always did have a bit of bottle, you.

45:33.887 --> 45:38.881
- So tell me, Bov. You come over to Millwall.
- [Woman] Is he a bit of a bully?

45:39.047 --> 45:44.167
- Did you come alone?
- [Woman laughs]

45:44.327 --> 45:47.683
What do you think?
Do you think that'd wind him up?

45:47.847 --> 45:51.681
- [She laughs]
- Excuse me a minute, Bov.

45:54.567 --> 45:59.277
Hello. I'm Tommy. Tommy Hatcher.

45:59.447 --> 46:02.678
- Yeah, I know.
- Oh, you know?

46:02.847 --> 46:05.964
Well, now, you see, that's bad.
That's really, really bad.

46:06.127 --> 46:10.166
You ain't got no fucking excuse
for not keeping that shit cunt of yours quiet.

46:10.327 --> 46:12.887
George, he can't talk to me like that.

46:13.047 --> 46:17.518
George, your bird hasn't stopped
fucking rabbiting since I've walked in here!

46:17.687 --> 46:20.201
Now, can I recommend that you shut her up?

46:20.367 --> 46:24.121
So I can continue my conversation
with our guest there, Bovver,

46:24.287 --> 46:26.278
of the once-proud GSE firm.

46:26.447 --> 46:29.598
- You can't tell me... Oh, my God!
- See what she's doing?

46:29.767 --> 46:33.521
Does she ever fucking, sodding, ever...?

46:33.687 --> 46:36.360
- That's enough!
- That's enough?

46:36.527 --> 46:39.564
I'll tell you when it's enough, son, all right?

46:39.727 --> 46:43.515
Tommy, the Paki's called the Old Bill, mate.
We best fuck off.

46:43.687 --> 46:46.076
Tommy, we best fuck off sharpish, mate.

46:48.887 --> 46:52.084
I'll see you again. Soon, Bov.

47:23.607 --> 47:25.996
I don't reckon I'll be back till tomorrow night.

47:26.167 --> 47:30.843
- Be gentle with her. And remember, left side.
- Left side. Right.

47:35.727 --> 47:39.800
- You seem nervous.
- Nervous? Fuck off.

47:39.967 --> 47:41.958
What's on your mind, then?

47:42.127 --> 47:46.643
Two little words keep every Hammer
in England up all night: United away.

47:46.807 --> 47:49.196
- Oi, oi!
- Aye aye!

47:50.807 --> 47:54.561
- All right, mate. You all right?
- Yeah, all right, big man?

47:54.727 --> 47:56.718
- Hello, Matt.
- All right?

47:58.567 --> 48:00.558
- Where's Bovver?
- Fuck knows.

48:00.727 --> 48:03.719
He's been a pain in the arse all week. PMS.

48:03.887 --> 48:07.846
Pre-Match Stress.
He's being a right cunt at the minute.

48:08.007 --> 48:11.397
- Come on, Pete. The train's in five minutes.
- Yeah, hang on.

48:14.207 --> 48:17.961
His phone's off. I can't believe
he's gonna pull a runner for United away.

48:18.127 --> 48:22.757
They'll be gunning for you, too, after the job
you pulled on their top boy last year.

48:22.927 --> 48:25.441
What happened last year?

48:25.607 --> 48:28.883
- I may have gone a bit over the top.
- Just a bit.

48:29.047 --> 48:32.039
- Where's Dave? Have you heard from him?
- Have you?

48:32.207 --> 48:36.359
Oh, everything's just falling
right into place, isn't it?

48:36.527 --> 48:39.485
- I'll go.
- No, mate.

48:39.647 --> 48:42.719
What? You can't just go up there
with lke and Swill.

48:42.887 --> 48:45.640
No offence, but we can't
take passengers on this trip.

48:45.807 --> 48:50.278
- Go on, piss off. Give you a bell later.
- How many reds d'you reckon'll turn up?

48:50.447 --> 48:52.642
Fuck knows.

48:52.807 --> 48:55.526
- Catch.
- How's that?

48:58.087 --> 49:01.238
The 2.55 train to Manchester...

49:01.407 --> 49:03.523
Oi.

49:03.687 --> 49:06.281
- All right, lads? Bovver?
- Pete.

49:06.447 --> 49:10.804
- I thought we agreed to meet in the car park.
- Decided to wait here.

49:10.967 --> 49:13.720
You want to play the wanker,
that's fine with me.

49:13.887 --> 49:17.357
But leave it out till we've got today out the way.

49:17.527 --> 49:19.518
- All right, mate?
- Sweet.

49:19.687 --> 49:22.520
Come on, boys. Let's have it!

49:27.807 --> 49:32.961
- I'm not lending you any more money.
- For fuck's sake, come on, play the game.

49:33.127 --> 49:38.440
- You never paid me the last time, you cunt.
- You taking the piss or what?

49:39.927 --> 49:43.283
- What are you doing?
- I thought it was just the three of you.

49:43.447 --> 49:48.726
Oh, isn't that sweet?
This what you were planning, eh?

49:48.887 --> 49:51.845
I ain't going in with that fucking mug.

49:52.007 --> 49:54.680
- Sit down, mate.
- Hello, mate.

49:55.927 --> 49:59.966
- Who's calling what here?
- Get on with the game.

50:01.167 --> 50:03.158
He's here now.

50:07.087 --> 50:08.918
[Phone rings]

50:14.447 --> 50:18.201
- Dave, where are you?
- Sorry I missed you. Flight was an hour late.

50:18.367 --> 50:19.959
- Fly faster.
- I'm here.

50:20.127 --> 50:22.880
- What, Manchester?
- Yeah.

50:23.047 --> 50:26.562
There's 40 of them waiting here,
all getting very fucking excited.

50:26.727 --> 50:28.479
Listen.

50:28.647 --> 50:29.875
United!

50:30.047 --> 50:33.926
- Bov.
- Unitedl Unitedl Unitedl

50:34.087 --> 50:35.406
Fuck.

50:35.567 --> 50:37.797
- Do you hear that?
- Yeah, man.

50:37.967 --> 50:41.755
They're waiting here for you.
Don't roll into Manchester.

50:41.927 --> 50:45.317
- All right, nice one.
- All right, laters.

50:45.487 --> 50:49.036
- We are fucked.
- What's happening?

- They're waiting for us at the station.
- They know we're on here?

50:52.807 --> 50:55.799
- Must have had a scout watching us.
- How many?

50:55.967 --> 50:59.482
- 40, 50.
- Can't we just get off at the next station?

50:59.647 --> 51:01.842
Fucking express train.
Don't stop till Manchester.

51:02.007 --> 51:04.885
Is that right, bruv?

51:08.367 --> 51:12.155
Come on, boys.
If we don't show up now, they'll claim a result.

51:12.327 --> 51:15.558
- We gotta get to that station first.
- We just got away.

51:15.727 --> 51:19.003
You shouldn't even be here!
This is what it's all about.

51:19.167 --> 51:21.727

- Fuck him!

Here's the plan. Ike, call Dave.
Tell him what's happening.

51:24.687 --> 51:28.123
It's about 12 miles to Manchester.
We need a couple of cabs immediately.

51:30.687 --> 51:33.679
[Pete] Fuck! Where's all the fucking cabs?

51:38.447 --> 51:41.996
- Pete, I got an idea.
- I thought I told you to shut up.

should've been here ten minutes ago.

- Sorry, guys.

52:17.807 --> 52:19.798
We're with Paramount Pictures,
shooting the new Hugh Grant film.

52:19.967 --> 52:22.356
- We gotta get this gear through.
- Hugh Grant film?

52:24.047 --> 52:25.480

had heard of me.

I'd never felt more confident.

And people could spot it
from a mile away.

I gotta be honest.

[Matt] Once you've taken a few punches
and realise you're not made of glass,

55:18.967 --> 55:25.406
you don't feel alive unless you're
pushing yourself as far as you can go.

55:32.807 --> 55:35.082
So what couldn't you tell me...?

55:39.087 --> 55:42.796

that you're expelled?

55:43.007 --> 55:44.838
- Why didn't you call me?
- I did.

55:45.007 --> 55:47.237
- Your machine answered.
- You could have left a message.

55:47.447 --> 55:52.043
Yeah, well, I'm tired of having a relationship
with your voicemail.

55:52.207 --> 55:55.756

- Hey, Matt!

55:55.927 --> 55:58.395
Matt, come on.

55:58.567 --> 56:00.797
- Shannon says you were set up. Is that true?
- Yes.

- Why didn't you find me?
- Why didn't I find you?

56:03.567 --> 56:06.764
- What's your fucking point?
- My point is, this doesn't look good, Matt.

56:06.927 --> 56:08.519
You say that you're set up.

56:08.687 --> 56:12.566
You don't contact your father?
We could've fought this if you were innocent.

56:12.727 --> 56:14.558
- If I were innocent?
- If you're innocent,

56:14.767 --> 56:17.327
- Why didn't you ask for help?
- You think I'm a drug dealer?

56:17.527 --> 56:19.597
- I don't know.
- What do you think?

56:19.847 --> 56:23.078
- I don't know.
- Well, that's why I didn't find you.

56:23.247 --> 56:28.082
Of course you don't know what to think.
You don't really know anything about me.

56:30.367 --> 56:34.406
- So you came to England?
- Yeah.

- OK, what now, Matt? What's the plan?
- What do you really want?

56:37.927 --> 56:40.395
- It's just a question.
- Listen, Carl.

Do you really expect me
to unburden myself to you?

you're the Dad again?

- Just someone I'd like you to meet.

about you.

It's not a gang, Dad. They're my friends.

- Am I writing about it? No.

I want you to come home with me.

59:13.727 --> 59:15.763
- What?!
- Look.

but as a fellow journalist,

- I'm not going home.
- Jesus...

Look, if it makes you feel better,
I am keeping a journal.

59:42.967 --> 59:45.356
It's one thing you taught me I held onto.

59:46.247 --> 59:47.600
I knew that.

59:48.287 --> 59:50.721
I was just making sure.

playing with Ben.

than he ever was a dad.

a decent bloke now.

when you were growing up.

- You know. Followed in his footsteps.
- What are you talking about? Matt did.

What do you mean?

01:01:40.687 --> 01:01:46.125

with our absentee father than I was.

That's what Matt studied at Harvard.

He was a journalism major.

01:01:55.247 --> 01:01:59.160

- I'm not, I quit. What's the difference?

it makes a huge difference.

he was down there.

01:04:21.727 --> 01:04:26.278
- This time I'd like to make sure of that myself.
- You sure of this, Bov?

01:04:26.487 --> 01:04:29.843
'Cause if you're coming in here like this,
you fucking well better be.

01:04:30.047 --> 01:04:32.163
Yeah, watch out, son.

01:04:42.367 --> 01:04:44.437
- What? This his, is it?
- Yeah.

01:04:44.607 --> 01:04:47.883
Yeah? What the fuck is this?

01:04:50.127 --> 01:04:53.676
Here, Keith, you know about all this
computer stuff. Have a look.

01:04:57.887 --> 01:05:00.242
What's this?

01:05:01.727 --> 01:05:03.843
Fucking cunt.

01:05:05.847 --> 01:05:08.361
Here we go.

01:05:08.527 --> 01:05:11.917
"First match:
West Ham v. Birmingham. Home.

01:05:12.127 --> 01:05:14.482
"Pete brought me to the Brigid Abbey Pub
on Walsh Road,

01:05:14.647 --> 01:05:17.241
"his main hangout,
and introduced me to his gang."

01:05:17.407 --> 01:05:20.843
Oh, look, we're a fucking gang now.

01:05:21.487 --> 01:05:23.523
Make it go up.

01:05:25.207 --> 01:05:28.040
"Bovver is Pete's thuggish righthand man.

01:05:28.207 --> 01:05:30.402
"Keith is sort of Bovver's enforcer."

01:05:30.607 --> 01:05:32.484
You happy now? We're all in there.

01:05:32.647 --> 01:05:34.558
He didn't say nothing about me.

01:05:35.767 --> 01:05:39.077
Wait here. I'll put some clothes on.

01:05:41.287 --> 01:05:45.485
- So you're the Major?
- I was the Major.

01:05:45.647 --> 01:05:49.356
I guess to some I still am.

01:05:51.087 --> 01:05:54.284
Terry here was my righthand man
back in the glory days.

01:05:54.487 --> 01:05:57.320
That was a long time ago, though, mate.

01:05:57.487 --> 01:05:59.557
Why'd you get out of it?

01:06:02.487 --> 01:06:04.478
I was a crazy bastard back then.

01:06:04.647 --> 01:06:08.959
All I fucking cared about was my reputation
amongst the firms of England.

01:06:09.127 --> 01:06:12.517
You've heard all the stories
about Millwall, yeah?

01:06:13.647 --> 01:06:18.198
Last match I went to was Millwall-West Ham.
We're talking a good ten years ago.

01:06:18.367 --> 01:06:22.519
I mean, we'd been waiting for this match
all year.

01:06:22.687 --> 01:06:25.884
At Millwall. Yeah, stepping into their ground.

01:06:26.047 --> 01:06:27.400
Completely outnumbered.

01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:30.843
We were fucking wired from the start.

01:06:31.007 --> 01:06:34.761
Now, Tommy Hatcher,
he was their main man back then.

01:06:35.207 --> 01:06:38.119
He used to bring his 12-year-old boy
to the grounds, Tommy Jr.

01:06:38.287 --> 01:06:42.565
Always banging on how he brought this kid up
to be like a little pitbull.

01:06:45.247 --> 01:06:48.956
Well, we lost that match, three nil.

01:06:49.127 --> 01:06:53.086
And those Millwall cunts
started laughing at us.

01:06:53.967 --> 01:06:57.801
And I just fucking snapped.

01:06:59.287 --> 01:07:01.642
I couldn't let it lie, you know?

01:07:02.647 --> 01:07:06.925
So I assembled all our troops
and we hunted them down.

01:07:09.967 --> 01:07:12.162
[Sombre piano music]

01:07:27.207 --> 01:07:30.279
I saw that little lad go down.

01:07:30.447 --> 01:07:33.519
[Tommy] Wait! No!

01:07:33.687 --> 01:07:38.841
And I saw his skull get crushed
under the boots of the GSE.

01:07:42.967 --> 01:07:45.527
I never went to another match after that.

01:07:45.687 --> 01:07:49.043
And I left "The Major" behind.

01:07:53.607 --> 01:07:56.201
And that's when I met your sister.

01:07:56.727 --> 01:08:00.037
She was my angel. She really saved me.

01:08:00.207 --> 01:08:03.563
Showed me a new life.
Helped me forget all this bollocks.

01:08:05.167 --> 01:08:10.878
And she swore she'd leave me
if I ever returned to it.

01:08:11.407 --> 01:08:15.605
And when it comes back to me, and
believe me, it fucking does, that madness...

01:08:15.767 --> 01:08:20.158
I mean, when I hear the roar of the stadium
on match day,

01:08:20.327 --> 01:08:23.524
the lads calling me to get pissed
out of me fucking tree...

01:08:23.727 --> 01:08:26.924
When I think of that,
I think about getting back into it...

01:08:27.567 --> 01:08:30.798
And Shannon and Ben, they remind me...

01:08:32.327 --> 01:08:35.080
...there's more to life than all this.

01:08:36.767 --> 01:08:40.805
Get all those juicy details, mate?
Writing it all down?

01:08:41.006 --> 01:08:44.078
- What?
- You fucking journo cunt!

01:08:47.447 --> 01:08:50.245
- You sure you know what you're doing here?
- He's fucking undercover.

01:08:50.407 --> 01:08:52.875
- Don't tell him nothing!
- I said, are you sure?

01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:55.362
What? You already knew.

01:08:55.567 --> 01:09:00.197
All I knew is that he studied journalism,
right, at Harvard. But he's dropped out.

01:09:00.367 --> 01:09:03.325
We found his journal,
full of stories about all of us.

01:09:03.527 --> 01:09:06.484
- It's a fucking diary!
- Ned saw you at the Times

01:09:06.647 --> 01:09:08.046
with a couple of journos.

01:09:08.207 --> 01:09:12.439
That was my Dad.
He's the journalist, you knew that.

01:09:12.607 --> 01:09:16.282
- His old man's a journo and you knew.
- That don't mean nothing yet.

01:09:16.447 --> 01:09:19.644
He studies to be a journo,
his old man is a journo.

01:09:19.807 --> 01:09:23.004
What's the difference?
You let one of them get in with us.

01:09:23.207 --> 01:09:26.916
- I wasn't trying to get anything.
- You, shut the...!

01:09:27.127 --> 01:09:30.915
I don't care who he is.
You don't do someone on the deck.

01:09:32.767 --> 01:09:36.965
What's wrong with you? He's gonna
bury us all and you're just gonna watch?

01:09:39.207 --> 01:09:42.643
No. Now, Steve, you're the Major.

01:09:42.846 --> 01:09:44.166
You started this firm.

01:09:44.367 --> 01:09:47.598
We got the biggest ruck of our lives
coming up,

01:09:47.767 --> 01:09:51.282
and your brother's too much
of a bottle-job to lead us.

01:09:52.687 --> 01:09:57.807
The GSE is Pete's firm. All right?
He calls the shots.

01:10:06.407 --> 01:10:09.319
Well, fuck the lot of you!

01:10:09.527 --> 01:10:11.358
GSE.

01:10:12.287 --> 01:10:14.243
Get out of the fucking way! Move!

01:10:16.727 --> 01:10:19.195
Get yourself cleaned up.

01:10:27.407 --> 01:10:29.363
Tommy.

01:10:31.007 --> 01:10:36.639
This is it, mate. We're finally gonna get back
at those fucking Hammer cunts, eh?

01:10:36.847 --> 01:10:40.522
[All chanting] Millwall! Millwall! Millwall!

01:10:49.127 --> 01:10:50.526
The fuck's he doing here?

01:10:50.727 --> 01:10:53.321
Marky, sit down, son. Sweet.

01:10:53.887 --> 01:10:57.800
- That's it. Do as you're told, you mug.
- Fuck off.

01:10:57.967 --> 01:11:02.518
Bovver. You know, we're gonna have
to stop meeting like this, don't you, son?

01:11:02.687 --> 01:11:07.602
People are gonna start to talk. What you doing
up so late on a school night?

01:11:08.367 --> 01:11:13.202
Shouldn't you be at home with your pals all
shitting at the thought of us turning you over?

01:11:13.407 --> 01:11:15.967
What, you had a lover's tiff?

01:11:18.127 --> 01:11:20.197
What do you want, Bov?

01:11:22.407 --> 01:11:24.602
Fucking Yank's an undercover journo.

01:11:28.287 --> 01:11:31.882
He's at our boozer now.
Tom, you gotta give him the chop.

01:11:32.047 --> 01:11:34.402
He's got 'em eating
out of the palm of his hand.

01:11:34.567 --> 01:11:39.118
What makes you think that I'd wanna
sort that out for you, eh?

01:11:39.287 --> 01:11:41.517
Because the Major's there too.

01:11:46.047 --> 01:11:48.880
Stevie Dunham's in there?

01:11:57.727 --> 01:12:00.560
- Thanks, Pete.
- Shut up! History student my arse.

01:12:00.727 --> 01:12:04.276
- Who the fuck are you?
- Sorry I lied about being a history major,

01:12:04.447 --> 01:12:05.766
but I'm not a journalist.

01:12:05.967 --> 01:12:08.162
It don't look fucking good, does it?

01:12:08.367 --> 01:12:12.519
- Why are you keeping a record?
- It's a journal. I've kept that my entire life.

01:12:12.727 --> 01:12:17.198
- Are you working for the Times?
- No. I'm telling you the truth.

01:12:17.367 --> 01:12:19.801
You've gotta trust me, Pete.

01:12:29.767 --> 01:12:33.680
Mate, you've put me right fucking in it.

01:12:33.847 --> 01:12:38.363
If I don't convince those boys that
the head of their firm was not just taken

01:12:38.527 --> 01:12:42.361
by a fucking Yank journo,
the GSE is done.

01:12:45.647 --> 01:12:50.038
So I'm gonna go out there and I'm
gonna tell them that Bov's got it wrong.

01:12:50.207 --> 01:12:52.562
And that you're one of us.

01:12:52.727 --> 01:12:56.356
And I had better be fucking right.

01:13:11.487 --> 01:13:16.515
So, Bovver, is there anything else
you wanna tell us?

01:13:16.687 --> 01:13:19.406
Tom, please.
This is how it's got to go down...

01:13:19.567 --> 01:13:21.797
You fucking... Go on, Marc.

01:13:21.967 --> 01:13:24.686
Afraid you're the only one
going down, little Bovver.

01:13:24.847 --> 01:13:26.724
Grass.

01:13:28.687 --> 01:13:30.996
Fuck!

01:13:31.167 --> 01:13:35.126
This shit with Bovver
could tear this firm apart.

01:13:35.287 --> 01:13:40.281
Mate, I need you.
Stay with us, just through Millwall.

01:13:42.807 --> 01:13:44.798
I'm not gonna help you.

01:13:44.967 --> 01:13:50.485
I made a promise to my wife and kid, all right?
And I'm sticking to it.

01:13:50.647 --> 01:13:56.324
You know, there comes a time
when the best reputation you can have

01:13:56.487 --> 01:13:58.239
is the one with your family...

01:14:00.487 --> 01:14:04.116
- [man] Down, get the fuck down!
- Hello, boys.

01:14:07.047 --> 01:14:08.958
Jesus!

01:14:19.647 --> 01:14:21.763
[Matt] Pete! Pete, come on, man!

01:14:24.927 --> 01:14:26.565
Terry.

01:14:28.127 --> 01:14:29.116
Fuck off!

01:14:32.887 --> 01:14:35.355
Terry!

01:14:37.567 --> 01:14:41.355
Look who's back in the fucking Abbey
after all these years.

01:14:41.527 --> 01:14:43.961
Tommy, I'm done with all this, mate.

01:14:44.127 --> 01:14:46.687
Retired, did you?
Got yourself a Yank wife, did you?

01:14:46.847 --> 01:14:50.044
Had a son of your own, did you?
I had a son once!

01:14:50.207 --> 01:14:52.402
Do you remember him?!
Do you fucking remember him?!

01:14:52.607 --> 01:14:55.201
- I'm sorry!
- It's too late!

01:14:56.007 --> 01:14:57.804
You fuck!

01:14:59.527 --> 01:15:01.404
Tommy!

01:15:04.207 --> 01:15:07.199
- You listen to me.
- Tommy!

01:15:07.367 --> 01:15:12.566
You die tonight, and me and you are even.

01:15:23.087 --> 01:15:25.521
It's done! Let's go!

01:15:38.847 --> 01:15:43.159
- Pete! Over here, mate, quick.
- Jesus, fucking hanging here, like!

01:15:46.767 --> 01:15:50.077
- [Steve] Ah, fucking hell.
- Get him down.

01:15:51.847 --> 01:15:53.997
[Bovver] I've messed.

01:15:54.167 --> 01:15:57.443
Bovver, what the fuck did you do?

01:15:58.127 --> 01:16:01.085
Get a fucking car!

01:16:05.047 --> 01:16:07.720
[Car alarm wails]

01:16:11.487 --> 01:16:12.715
[Terry] Move!

01:16:12.887 --> 01:16:16.516
[Steve] Agh! Fucking hell!
[Terry] Move!

01:16:16.687 --> 01:16:20.043
[Pete] Get in there.
[Terry] Get him the fuck in the car!

01:16:23.007 --> 01:16:25.475
[Terry] Get in! Go!

01:16:26.007 --> 01:16:30.444
Go! Fucking go!
Get out of the way! Move, move!

01:16:42.647 --> 01:16:45.719
Somebody help!
Help us, he's been fucking stabbed!

01:16:45.887 --> 01:16:48.321
Come on, hurry!

01:16:49.887 --> 01:16:53.402
[Matt] Fucking hurry up!
[Man] Resus. Go, go.

01:17:23.287 --> 01:17:26.404
- What did he say?
- He's hanging on.

01:17:41.967 --> 01:17:44.686
Trusting lads.

01:17:44.847 --> 01:17:48.840
You always said trusting lads
was my problem, Bov.

01:17:49.047 --> 01:17:55.202
I trust lads too much.
Trust the Yank too much.

01:17:55.367 --> 01:17:58.677
This is how you prove your point?

01:17:58.847 --> 01:18:06.117
Backstabbing me? Teaming up
with Tommy Hatcher to kill the Major?

01:18:06.927 --> 01:18:09.395
Kill my fucking brother?!

01:18:10.287 --> 01:18:14.405
I'll kill Tommy.
Just say the word and I'll do it.

01:18:16.087 --> 01:18:19.477
I don't need you for that.

01:18:19.647 --> 01:18:24.562
I don't need you for anything anymore.

01:18:28.407 --> 01:18:30.398
Go away.

01:18:31.287 --> 01:18:34.040
Please, I fucked up...

01:18:57.727 --> 01:19:00.082
[automatic door opens]

01:19:11.847 --> 01:19:13.963
Shannon.

01:19:14.127 --> 01:19:17.199
Sick! You're so sick!

01:19:54.687 --> 01:19:56.837
[He gasps]

01:19:57.487 --> 01:19:59.478
[Whispers inaudibly]

01:20:01.887 --> 01:20:04.401
I'm so sorry.

01:20:07.247 --> 01:20:09.477
I know.

01:20:24.567 --> 01:20:27.400
The doctor said that you're gonna be OK.

01:20:28.487 --> 01:20:31.524
He said it's just gonna take a little time.

01:20:39.007 --> 01:20:41.726
We're leaving tomorrow.

01:20:51.607 --> 01:20:54.167
It's not safe for us here now.

01:21:14.567 --> 01:21:17.957
- How is he?
- He's hanging in there.

01:21:18.167 --> 01:21:21.876
- So, what now?
- You let Tommy know I want a straightener.

01:21:22.087 --> 01:21:24.920
- Tomorrow.
- All right.

01:21:25.127 --> 01:21:28.836
We finish this once and for all.
Somewhere quiet.

01:21:29.047 --> 01:21:30.605
Away from Old Bill.

01:21:30.807 --> 01:21:33.560
- Your mate still runs security at Trinity Wharf?
- Yeah.

01:21:33.767 --> 01:21:36.156
- Get hold of him. Set it up.
- Sure.

01:21:37.967 --> 01:21:40.561
Come on.

01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:46.880
[Knocking]

01:21:56.087 --> 01:21:57.759
What's going on?

01:21:57.927 --> 01:22:00.600

Burn it downl

# Want me, come and get me, pig
You want a piece of me

01:42:43.847 --> 01:42:49.717
# Why can't you lie?
Why can't you let me be?

# Well, there are clean-cut sergeants
To the massive

01:43:00.367 --> 01:43:02.483
# But all they ever do
Is take it up their asses

01:43:02.647 --> 01:43:04.558
# And on the day that they end up in jail

01:43:04.727 --> 01:43:07.446

Their badge is their bail

# Now you want treats
With no clip at your hip

01:43:09.847 --> 01:43:12.361
# You gotta fight fist to fist
Ain't life a trip

01:43:12.527 --> 01:43:14.518
# And all the drugs you said
Were killing my brain

01:43:14.687 --> 01:43:19.078
# Look who's got his nose deep
In the cocaine

01:43:19.247 --> 01:43:24.116
# Buy it, buy it, don't deny it
You never know how it feels till you try it
