(whooshing noises)

00:01.913 --> 00:04.689
(ear ringing noise)

00:04.689 --> 00:07.639
(ominous drone and heavy hit)

00:12.969 --> 00:13.985
(water sucking in reverse)

00:15.370 --> 00:16.478
(water sucking in reverse)

00:18.185 --> 00:19.018
(water sucking in reverse)

00:21.113 --> 00:21.946
(water sucking in reverse)

00:23.269 --> 00:24.902
(traffic whizzing by)

00:26.099 --> 00:27.332
(ominous bell tone)

00:28.776 --> 00:29.959
(irritating buzzing sound)

00:31.470 --> 00:32.744
(ominous bell tones)

00:33.909 --> 00:35.175
(haunting wind and
irritating buzzing sound)

00:36.774 --> 00:38.057
(ominous bell tones)

00:39.576 --> 00:41.017

00:45.879 --> 00:48.270

00:55.557 --> 00:58.050
(heavy drum hits)

00:58.050 --> 00:59.408
(tires screeching and glass breaking)

01:11.979 --> 01:14.646
(ominous music)

01:18.911 --> 01:21.661
(sirens blaring)

01:23.182 --> 01:24.854
- [EMT] Clear, clear!

01:24.854 --> 01:25.687
Shocking.

01:32.886 --> 01:33.719
- [Man] Can you save her?

01:33.719 --> 01:35.767
- [EMT] We're gonna do the best we can.

01:35.767 --> 01:38.350
(somber music)

02:57.988 --> 03:00.488
(strong wind)

03:02.292 --> 03:04.542
(knocking)

03:10.034 --> 03:10.867
- Kevin!

03:10.867 --> 03:11.700
- Mr. Faraday.

03:11.700 --> 03:12.820
- So glad to finally meet you, come on in.

03:12.820 --> 03:14.448
- Hi Kevin, I'm Phyllis.

03:14.448 --> 03:16.957
Hi, hi, hi, I'm Phyllis.

03:16.957 --> 03:17.987
- Hi, Jessi.

03:17.987 --> 03:19.890
Nice to meet you.
- Hi, Jessi.

03:19.890 --> 03:21.568
- Welcome back to Pittsburgh.

03:21.568 --> 03:22.707
- It feels good to be back.

03:22.707 --> 03:24.050
(laughing)

03:24.050 --> 03:26.130
- Your Uncle Frank loved you so much.

03:26.130 --> 03:28.203
- Oh, I loved him very much also.

03:29.060 --> 03:30.463
- We are so sorry.

03:31.521 --> 03:32.977
- Thank you.

03:32.977 --> 03:34.600
- It's so nice of you guys

03:34.600 --> 03:36.830
to take care of Kevin's
uncle's things for him.

03:36.830 --> 03:37.663
- [Kevin] Yes.

03:37.663 --> 03:38.573
- Sure, no problem.

03:39.820 --> 03:40.870
- I appreciate it.

03:40.870 --> 03:41.703
- Come on in.

03:41.703 --> 03:43.430
We'll sign the papers,
it's a great little place,

03:43.430 --> 03:44.490
you're gonna love it.

03:48.759 --> 03:50.910
This is all gonna be quite simple.

03:50.910 --> 03:52.430
Since there was a will,

03:52.430 --> 03:54.160
this paperwork will
take care of everything.

03:54.160 --> 03:55.991
- Oh, all right.
- It's all easy peasy.

03:55.991 --> 03:57.371
- (chuckles) Sounds good.

03:57.371 --> 03:58.204
- All right.

03:58.204 --> 03:59.410
- Do you mind if I take a look around?

03:59.410 --> 04:01.120
You don't need me for this, do you?

04:01.120 --> 04:03.639
- It's practically your
house now, darling.

04:03.639 --> 04:04.880
(chuckling)

04:04.880 --> 04:05.713
- Thank you.

04:07.387 --> 04:09.360
- So, I just need you to initial

04:09.360 --> 04:10.820
each of these pages.

04:10.820 --> 04:12.650
There's been a total
inspection on the house,

04:12.650 --> 04:14.928
it's in perfect condition.

04:14.928 --> 04:17.845
(mysterious music)

05:33.676 --> 05:36.588
(strange ringing)

05:36.588 --> 05:39.255
(ominous music)

05:43.822 --> 05:46.989
(haunting whispering)

05:51.482 --> 05:54.399
(mysterious music)

06:05.353 --> 06:06.872
One more.

06:06.872 --> 06:09.789
(mysterious music)

06:23.437 --> 06:25.104
- Are you all right?

06:29.848 --> 06:33.098
- [Mr. Faraday] Congratulations, Kevin.

06:43.407 --> 06:46.232
- Actually, Mr. Faraday,

06:46.232 --> 06:47.550
can I ask you something?

06:47.550 --> 06:48.383
- Sure.

06:49.620 --> 06:53.250
- You were close with my uncle, right?

06:53.250 --> 06:54.243
- [Mr. Faraday] Yes.

06:56.950 --> 07:01.823
- Why did he do what he did?

07:05.960 --> 07:08.693
- Well, your Uncle was acting
very strange at the end.

07:10.140 --> 07:12.093
I can't quite put my finger on it.

07:13.270 --> 07:15.749
We can talk about it over dinner.

07:15.749 --> 07:16.678
- (chuckles) Right.

07:16.678 --> 07:19.370
Drop by later.

07:19.370 --> 07:20.203
- Sounds great.

07:21.910 --> 07:22.743
- Thanks again.

07:22.743 --> 07:23.576
- Thanks.

07:23.576 --> 07:24.409
Nice meeting you.

07:24.409 --> 07:25.641
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

07:25.641 --> 07:26.541
- Enjoy your trip.

07:27.584 --> 07:28.584
- Thank you.

07:32.853 --> 07:35.153
(laughing)

07:35.153 --> 07:35.986
- [Kevin] Oh.

07:35.986 --> 07:38.430
- This is a really old house.

07:38.430 --> 07:41.180
When's the rest of our stuff getting here?

07:41.180 --> 07:44.120
- Well, it's a pretty busy time of year.

07:44.120 --> 07:46.340
The mover said our stuff
should be here next week.

07:46.340 --> 07:47.440
- Well, that's shitty.

07:48.300 --> 07:49.582
- I got it.
- You cool?

07:49.582 --> 07:50.415
- Yeah.

07:55.160 --> 07:57.900
- Well, and do you still have a surprise

07:57.900 --> 07:59.247
for me tomorrow?

07:59.247 --> 08:01.956
- (chuckles) Yes, I sure do.

08:01.956 --> 08:04.699
And you are absolutely going to love it.

08:04.699 --> 08:05.870
- Really?
- Yes.

08:05.870 --> 08:09.737
- Well, I have a surprise for you tonight.

08:09.737 --> 08:10.570
- Oh yeah?

08:10.570 --> 08:11.511
- Yep.

08:11.511 --> 08:13.850
(chuckles)

08:13.850 --> 08:16.070
So, you better hurry up with those boxes

08:16.070 --> 08:17.321
and come and get it.

08:17.321 --> 08:18.408
Okay?
- All right.

08:18.408 --> 08:19.489
(chuckling)

08:19.489 --> 08:21.396
(playful yelp)

08:21.396 --> 08:23.830
(strong wind)

08:23.830 --> 08:25.083
- [Jessi] So this is it?

08:26.480 --> 08:29.620
It's amazing.

08:29.620 --> 08:32.070
- [Kevin] I guess you like your surprise.

08:32.070 --> 08:34.653
As soon as I saw it, I knew
I had to bring you here.

08:35.929 --> 08:38.200
- I love it, I mean...

08:38.200 --> 08:39.820
I studied buildings like this in school,

08:39.820 --> 08:41.520
but it's so much different

08:41.520 --> 08:43.570
to actually be in one.

08:43.570 --> 08:47.393
You know, just completely
surrounded by beauty.

08:48.580 --> 08:51.340
- I see, and all the stuff you're building

08:51.340 --> 08:52.780
that people run to once a week

08:52.780 --> 08:55.910
because they're scared to
death of going to hell.

08:55.910 --> 08:59.060
But you, you see past that.

08:59.060 --> 09:02.730
- I study architecture, that's
nothing really profound.

09:02.730 --> 09:05.388
I just appreciate good work.

09:05.388 --> 09:06.370
- No.

09:06.370 --> 09:08.180
You find deeper meaning in things

09:08.180 --> 09:09.913
that other people just overlook.

09:10.850 --> 09:13.370
Like when you took a chance on me.

09:13.370 --> 09:14.690
That's the something special in you

09:14.690 --> 09:17.413
that I just naturally want to protect.

09:19.170 --> 09:21.183
Whenever you were in the hospital,

09:25.770 --> 09:28.673
I never felt so helpless in my life.

09:29.730 --> 09:33.263
I wanted to make you better.

09:35.190 --> 09:37.390
I couldn't stand seeing
you in so much pain.

09:39.760 --> 09:42.010
- You moved all of our stuff from D.C.

09:42.010 --> 09:44.460
just so I could go to treatment,

09:44.460 --> 09:46.990
and you dropped out of law school.

09:46.990 --> 09:50.033
Kevin, I'm really sorry.

09:51.140 --> 09:52.270
- Don't worry about it.

09:52.270 --> 09:55.423
- I never told you how much it meant.

09:56.470 --> 09:58.503
I never could've made it without you.

10:02.420 --> 10:05.003
(phone buzzes)

10:06.124 --> 10:07.394
- It's work.

10:07.394 --> 10:09.170
I gotta take this.

10:09.170 --> 10:11.087
Hold on one sec, sorry.

10:12.490 --> 10:13.940
Hello?

10:13.940 --> 10:15.272
Yeah, Mr. Lavine.

10:15.272 --> 10:16.956
(strange ringing)

10:16.956 --> 10:18.547
Uh huh.

10:18.547 --> 10:21.236
Yeah, but I'm out with my wife right now.

10:21.236 --> 10:22.319
Yeah, I know.

10:23.779 --> 10:24.612
All right, yeah.

10:24.612 --> 10:26.013
I'll be there.

10:26.013 --> 10:29.132
(strange ringing)

10:29.132 --> 10:31.799
(ominous music)

11:20.577 --> 11:22.562
(growling)

11:22.562 --> 11:25.958
(demonic whispering)

11:25.958 --> 11:27.595
Jessi, what the fuck?

11:27.595 --> 11:30.428
(strange ringing)

11:35.212 --> 11:37.629
Jessi, what's wrong with you?

11:45.074 --> 11:46.907
- I got turned around.

11:50.120 --> 11:50.953
I saw...

11:55.080 --> 11:55.913
No.

11:56.779 --> 12:00.764
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you.

12:00.764 --> 12:03.540
- You know what happened the
last time you disappeared.

12:03.540 --> 12:04.573
For God's sake!

12:07.900 --> 12:09.480
We have to go.

12:09.480 --> 12:10.980
I have to work in the morning.

12:12.811 --> 12:15.478
(ominous music)

13:08.979 --> 13:11.979
(creepy whispering)

13:44.254 --> 13:45.254
- Oh, shit...

13:46.585 --> 13:49.252
(ominous music)

14:21.310 --> 14:24.143
(strange ringing)

14:25.050 --> 14:28.050
(creepy whispering)

14:41.583 --> 14:44.040
- I'm just gonna have a
few sips of beer and leave,

14:44.040 --> 14:47.870
but by the end of the party

14:47.870 --> 14:52.870
I was just hammered and snorting lines

14:53.190 --> 14:55.543
off Rob's table in the living room.

14:58.040 --> 14:59.810
I don't even remember leaving but

15:00.740 --> 15:04.090
what I do remember is just waking up

15:06.170 --> 15:08.563
and just seeing an airbag in my face,

15:09.630 --> 15:11.010
and looking out the front windshield

15:11.010 --> 15:14.190
and just seeing the hood all bent up

15:14.190 --> 15:16.493
and me wrapped around a telephone pole.

15:17.560 --> 15:18.610
- Thanks for sharing.

15:19.670 --> 15:21.470
Jessi, we all wanna welcome you back

15:21.470 --> 15:22.570
to the Black and Gold.

15:25.510 --> 15:26.970
- Our stuff should be here from D.C.

15:26.970 --> 15:28.303
in a couple of weeks and

15:29.419 --> 15:31.990
we should be settled in
to our new home by then.

15:31.990 --> 15:34.170
- Shit, a couple weeks?

15:34.170 --> 15:36.560
Is your stuff being carried
by the Pony Express?

15:36.560 --> 15:38.893
- Patrick, that was rude of you.

15:39.790 --> 15:41.133
Apologize to Jessi.

15:42.920 --> 15:44.530
- Sorry, Jessi.

15:44.530 --> 15:46.623
- So, Jessi, how do you feel right now?

15:48.600 --> 15:52.163
- Um, okay.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.190
I guess.

15:54.190 --> 15:56.651
Could you tell us what's going on?

15:56.651 --> 15:57.873
You seem so distant.

15:59.440 --> 16:00.600
- Well...

16:03.270 --> 16:04.230
Um...

16:06.730 --> 16:11.493
I had a really troubling dream last night.

16:14.185 --> 16:15.585
I was at my grandmother's...

16:16.750 --> 16:19.410
(ominous music)

16:19.410 --> 16:21.553
- [Therapist] Can you tell
us more about your dream?

16:22.725 --> 16:23.558
- Do I have to?

16:25.120 --> 16:27.070
- Well, we'd all like to hear about it.

16:28.539 --> 16:31.206
(ominous music)

16:37.275 --> 16:39.692
(rain falls)

16:41.760 --> 16:44.493
- It was raining so hard.

16:45.390 --> 16:47.230
I always remember in raining in London

16:47.230 --> 16:48.080
when I was a kid.

16:49.337 --> 16:50.250
I don't know if that's true,

16:50.250 --> 16:52.450
but that's the way I remember it.

16:52.450 --> 16:55.320
It's funny how you remember things

16:55.320 --> 16:56.370
differently as a kid.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.393
There was a fire behind her house,

17:04.593 --> 17:06.030
and it was so bright,

17:06.030 --> 17:08.450
I remember the red and yellow

17:08.450 --> 17:10.510
iridescent hues dancing on the walls

17:10.510 --> 17:11.522
as I approached it.

17:13.910 --> 17:15.200
And as I got closer,

17:15.200 --> 17:16.992
I saw the firetruck on the corner.

17:18.310 --> 17:19.630
And there was no fire,

17:19.630 --> 17:21.463
it was the lights from the firetruck.

17:23.170 --> 17:24.970
And there were firemen

17:24.970 --> 17:26.853
leaned over someone on the street,

17:28.528 --> 17:30.778
and they turned around
and they looked at me,

17:32.410 --> 17:36.890
and I screamed because they just had these

17:36.890 --> 17:39.183
blazing yellow eyes just staring at me.

17:42.593 --> 17:44.993
And then the person on
the ground stood up and

17:48.257 --> 17:49.090
it was me.

17:52.075 --> 17:55.415
- [Therapist] What do you think it meant?

17:55.415 --> 17:56.665
- I don't know.

18:00.190 --> 18:02.940
Maybe that someone's watching me.

18:04.287 --> 18:05.770
- Why don't you take your stupid

18:05.770 --> 18:07.830
demonic dreams somewhere else.

18:07.830 --> 18:09.040
Find a priest.

18:09.040 --> 18:09.873
- [Therapist] Riley.

18:09.873 --> 18:10.870
- What is this shit?

18:10.870 --> 18:13.840
- Why are we talking
about stuff like this?

18:13.840 --> 18:15.840
- Offended over a stupid fucking dream.

18:15.840 --> 18:16.895
- [Therapist] Everybody just calm down.

18:16.895 --> 18:18.407
- [Riley] It's fucking stupid.

18:18.407 --> 18:20.429
- [Therapist] Just stop for a second.

18:20.429 --> 18:22.183
Guys, it's Jessi's turn to talk.

18:22.183 --> 18:24.850
(intense music)

18:29.930 --> 18:31.953
- It's fucking funny, you bitch?

18:31.953 --> 18:33.480
You think you could say
whatever the fuck you want

18:33.480 --> 18:34.651
whenever the fuck you want?

18:34.651 --> 18:35.641
You shut the fuck up,

18:35.641 --> 18:36.718
you shut the fuck up!

18:36.718 --> 18:38.324
- [Therapist] Calm down, Jessi.

18:38.324 --> 18:39.277
- Why don't I just come over there--

18:39.277 --> 18:40.110
- Calm down.

18:40.110 --> 18:41.977
- And put my fist down
your fucking throat!

18:41.977 --> 18:43.390
I'm gonna teach you to fuck with me.

18:43.390 --> 18:44.337
You bitch!

18:44.337 --> 18:47.087
(dramatic music)

18:56.186 --> 18:57.186
- Calm down.

18:58.577 --> 19:00.577
Breathe, just calm down.

19:10.130 --> 19:12.267
- Hey, need a ride?

19:12.267 --> 19:13.284
- Oh, no.

19:13.284 --> 19:14.236
No, thanks.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.069
- Come on.

19:26.681 --> 19:28.760
- [Driver] So, where do you live?

19:28.760 --> 19:29.593
- Northside.

19:30.440 --> 19:31.790
- Oh, we're going that way.

19:32.720 --> 19:35.960
- Listen, that girl is always a bitch.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.810
Maybe she needs an ass
kicking or something.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.750
- So where are you from?

19:39.750 --> 19:40.783
- I'm from London.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.170
Well, kinda.

19:43.170 --> 19:45.700
I grew up in Singapore, and London.

19:45.700 --> 19:48.470
My dad's a doctor and he
traveled a lot for work.

19:48.470 --> 19:50.400
- Oh, so what brought you here?

19:50.400 --> 19:51.930
The country, I mean.

19:51.930 --> 19:53.300
- I like to travel.

19:53.300 --> 19:55.970
I am an architecture nut.

19:55.970 --> 19:57.270
I wanted to see the world.

19:58.570 --> 20:02.363
I met my husband, and next
thing you know, can't leave.

20:05.050 --> 20:07.460
He's the best thing that
ever happened to me.

20:07.460 --> 20:08.800
- I'm sure you're the best thing

20:08.800 --> 20:10.200
that's ever happened to him.

20:11.687 --> 20:12.520
- I am.

20:12.520 --> 20:14.853
(chuckling)

20:33.420 --> 20:35.560
Well, this is it.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.260
Thanks so much for cheering me up.

20:38.531 --> 20:39.773
I haven't been in Pennsylvania in a while,

20:39.773 --> 20:42.520
it's nice to know I can have friends here.

20:43.460 --> 20:44.910
- It's cool, anytime.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.780
Just let me know if you
need someone to talk to.

20:46.780 --> 20:48.090
- [Driver] Yeah, if you get lonely,

20:48.090 --> 20:49.550
just call us, we're a support group.

20:49.550 --> 20:50.883
So, don't hesitate.

20:52.440 --> 20:55.050
- Would you like to come in for some tea?

20:55.050 --> 20:56.950
- [Driver] Oh, no, see
I have to go take care

20:56.950 --> 20:57.783
of my little girl,

20:57.783 --> 20:59.730
and the babysitter has to leave, so.

20:59.730 --> 21:00.680
- Oh, come on.

21:00.680 --> 21:02.440
It's a very British thing to do,

21:02.440 --> 21:05.343
and you'll be in and
out before you know it.

21:05.343 --> 21:07.550
- I don't have anywhere to be.

21:07.550 --> 21:08.383
I'm off today.

21:09.490 --> 21:10.850
- Oh, okay.

21:10.850 --> 21:12.836
But I have to call the babysitter first.

21:12.836 --> 21:13.996
- Yes!

21:13.996 --> 21:14.913
Okay, cool.

21:24.530 --> 21:25.363
- Hello?

21:26.970 --> 21:29.340
Yeah, I'm gonna be late.

21:29.340 --> 21:31.270
- So basically, I live at the church.

21:31.270 --> 21:33.373
But I love doing God's work.

21:36.730 --> 21:38.610
This is just a nice little house.

21:38.610 --> 21:40.010
Did your husband inherit it?

21:41.890 --> 21:46.890
- Yeah, from his uncle who
was a world renown historian.

21:47.490 --> 21:50.893
Specialized in Ancient Mesopotamia?

21:53.796 --> 21:55.446
Yeah, he passed away a month ago.

21:58.450 --> 22:01.520
Actually, I think I found

22:01.520 --> 22:04.150
one of his pieces in the house.

22:04.150 --> 22:05.500
Do you guys want to see it?

22:06.600 --> 22:08.773
- I would like to see something like that.

22:10.210 --> 22:11.043
- Yeah.

22:12.579 --> 22:13.412
- Come.

22:15.891 --> 22:19.257
(ominous music)

22:19.257 --> 22:22.090
(strange ringing)

22:25.986 --> 22:28.238
- I wouldn't take this to church.

22:28.238 --> 22:30.150
- I wouldn't take this anywhere.

22:30.150 --> 22:33.243
- It looks like a mentally
challenged person made it.

22:35.421 --> 22:37.383
- It looks really, really old.

22:39.252 --> 22:41.919
- It's at least 3,000 years old.

22:45.683 --> 22:47.672
- I hope I look better at 3,000.

22:47.672 --> 22:49.716
(chuckling)

22:49.716 --> 22:50.716
- It's ugly.

22:54.547 --> 22:55.896
What's going on with us?

22:55.896 --> 22:57.137
- [Woman] I don't know!

22:57.137 --> 22:59.236
The door won't open.

22:59.236 --> 23:01.389
(banging)

23:01.389 --> 23:04.976
(strange ringing)

23:04.976 --> 23:07.643
(ominous music)

24:38.026 --> 24:41.438
(radio chatter)

24:41.438 --> 24:44.271
(strange ringing)

24:49.420 --> 24:50.587
- [Kevin] Hey.

24:57.340 --> 24:58.173
Hey.

25:03.852 --> 25:05.358
What are you doing?

25:05.358 --> 25:06.775
What is all this?

25:12.565 --> 25:13.398
- Oh, hey.

25:14.603 --> 25:15.686
I don't know.

25:22.979 --> 25:24.396
I can't remember.

25:26.477 --> 25:27.310
- Okay.

25:29.032 --> 25:29.865
Okay.

25:30.740 --> 25:32.066
- I can't remember.

25:32.066 --> 25:34.233
- It's all right, come on.

25:48.151 --> 25:50.651
(strong wind)

25:54.003 --> 25:56.670
(ominous music)

26:30.200 --> 26:32.450
(growling)

26:34.995 --> 26:37.662
(ominous music)

27:17.565 --> 27:18.648
- Hey, Jessi.

27:19.544 --> 27:20.377
- Hey.

27:24.827 --> 27:27.577
(loud commotion)

27:46.157 --> 27:48.560
- So, how was your trip this morning?

27:48.560 --> 27:50.420
Public transportation really stinks

27:50.420 --> 27:51.873
when it's this cold outside.

27:56.770 --> 28:00.513
- I think something's wrong with me.

28:02.020 --> 28:03.520
- So, things haven't been going well

28:03.520 --> 28:05.200
since you got back?

28:05.200 --> 28:07.113
- [Jessi] No, they haven't.

28:11.630 --> 28:14.040
- Let's talk about
yesterday's group session.

28:14.040 --> 28:15.450
- What about it?

28:15.450 --> 28:16.580
- [Therapist] There was a minor outburst

28:16.580 --> 28:17.730
that ended the session.

28:20.120 --> 28:21.720
How did you feel about that?

28:21.720 --> 28:23.373
- It was really upsetting to me.

28:24.260 --> 28:25.680
I felt like I was being attacked

28:25.680 --> 28:26.730
by you and that girl.

28:29.680 --> 28:30.980
- You felt like you were being attacked

28:30.980 --> 28:32.510
by me and Riley?

28:32.510 --> 28:33.343
- Yes.

28:39.090 --> 28:41.523
The story was really important to me.

28:42.938 --> 28:44.410
I had this terrible dream,

28:44.410 --> 28:45.960
I've been having terrible dreams

28:45.960 --> 28:49.310
and I've been seeing things,

28:49.310 --> 28:52.903
and what she said was
really derogatory to me.

28:55.230 --> 28:56.360
- [Therapist] Tolerance is the big

28:56.360 --> 28:57.763
prerequisite of the group.

28:59.370 --> 29:00.410
- Yes, I know.

29:02.470 --> 29:04.073
I understand, I just,

29:06.086 --> 29:08.830
I don't like being accused
of something so horrific

29:08.830 --> 29:10.661
as what she said.

29:10.661 --> 29:14.113
It hurt my feelings,
because it's not true.

29:15.030 --> 29:18.635
- You mean about the thing
about you being demonic.

29:18.635 --> 29:19.802
- [Jessi] Yes.

29:21.520 --> 29:24.010
- So tell me, how do you
really feel about that?

29:24.010 --> 29:26.230
- How do I really feel about that?

29:26.230 --> 29:27.930
I think it's fucking ridiculous,

29:27.930 --> 29:29.240
and I think it's fucking ridiculous

29:29.240 --> 29:31.223
that you ask me how I feel bout that.

29:34.210 --> 29:37.070
- Group therapy is about everyone sharing.

29:37.070 --> 29:39.590
Allowing the members to experiment

29:39.590 --> 29:40.953
without fear of failure.

29:45.210 --> 29:49.673
You know, we all have things
that we're suffering from.

29:50.930 --> 29:52.230
Riley's suffering too.

29:52.230 --> 29:54.003
The same way that you are.

29:55.960 --> 29:59.253
- So you're what, asking
me to be sympathetic?

30:00.450 --> 30:02.893
- [Therapist] I want you to be empathetic.

30:05.940 --> 30:10.060
- I told you, something is going on here

30:10.060 --> 30:12.093
and I don't know what it is.

30:16.280 --> 30:17.710
- [Therapist] So what
else is happening to you

30:17.710 --> 30:19.583
on top of the dreams you described?

30:24.370 --> 30:27.023
- I'm having more than
one dream, I told you.

30:29.920 --> 30:34.640
I've been seeing things,
and I'm not relapsing.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.233
Something is happening here.

30:45.180 --> 30:48.550
- Somehow, we got to get to
the bottom of your anxiety.

30:48.550 --> 30:50.210
You were fine when you left the hospital,

30:50.210 --> 30:54.333
but now everything seems to be relapsing.

30:55.690 --> 30:58.910
- I told you, I'm not relapsing.

30:58.910 --> 31:01.387
How many ways do I have to tell you?

31:04.052 --> 31:07.016
Exactly what is it that you want from me?

31:07.016 --> 31:09.849
(strange ringing)

31:13.010 --> 31:15.083
- [Therapist] Are you still
taking your medication?

31:20.526 --> 31:22.555
- Did you lose your intelligence

31:22.555 --> 31:24.829
after you got your degree?

31:24.829 --> 31:26.923
I already fucking told you

31:26.923 --> 31:29.074
something is going on here.

31:29.074 --> 31:30.991
Do you understand that?

31:32.166 --> 31:33.541
Did my husband call you?

31:33.541 --> 31:35.768
Fuck him if he did.

31:35.768 --> 31:38.970
You piece of shit, you
think I'm so stupid.

31:40.062 --> 31:42.562
You are such a disgusting man.

31:43.440 --> 31:46.723
You sit there thinking
you are so fucking smart,

31:46.723 --> 31:47.806
so important.

31:49.617 --> 31:51.252
You don't know shit.

31:51.252 --> 31:52.850
Where'd you get your degree anyway?

31:52.850 --> 31:54.869
Some online fucking university?

31:54.869 --> 31:56.641
- Jessi, you just need to stop this.

31:56.641 --> 32:00.161
- You are such a fucking small man,

32:00.161 --> 32:02.328
in more ways than visible.

32:03.865 --> 32:05.820
- [Therapist] Jessi, I said to stop it.

32:05.820 --> 32:07.178
- You wouldn't know good therapy

32:07.178 --> 32:09.469
if you fell in a room with 30 people

32:09.469 --> 32:12.219
pissing and crying on themselves.

32:15.138 --> 32:17.805
(ominous music)

32:45.006 --> 32:47.408
- What's up, baby brother?

32:47.408 --> 32:48.658
What's shakin'?

32:49.963 --> 32:51.593
- Man, I knew I'd find you here.

32:52.717 --> 32:53.550
- Yeah.

32:55.430 --> 32:56.963
Library's my home now, bro.

32:58.580 --> 33:00.280
Trying to pass this bar and stuff.

33:02.139 --> 33:03.539
When'd you get back in town?

33:04.780 --> 33:05.763
- A few days ago.

33:08.140 --> 33:08.973
How's your knee?

33:11.790 --> 33:12.990
- Three surgeries later.

33:16.126 --> 33:19.942
This world is hard on this body, bro.

33:19.942 --> 33:21.543
So I'm glad we use this.

33:24.360 --> 33:27.010
Athletics is good but sure enough,

33:27.010 --> 33:28.210
they don't last forever.

33:31.591 --> 33:32.530
- Yeah.

33:32.530 --> 33:34.730
Still, I wish I was in
the position you are.

33:37.640 --> 33:41.703
Studying for the bar and
about to finish law school.

33:44.980 --> 33:46.360
- Don't worry about it, man.

33:47.550 --> 33:48.400
You'll get there.

33:49.501 --> 33:50.430
Right now you're taking care

33:50.430 --> 33:53.677
of the love of your life.

33:53.677 --> 33:55.203
She's still the love of your life, right?

33:56.173 --> 33:58.423
(laughing)

33:59.543 --> 34:01.667
Ah, I'm just kidding, man.

34:01.667 --> 34:03.183
I know she is.

34:04.506 --> 34:06.756
(laughing)

34:08.693 --> 34:10.945
Jessi's okay, right?

34:10.945 --> 34:13.612
(ominous music)

34:17.389 --> 34:18.473
- Not really.

34:22.120 --> 34:23.270
- What's going on, bro?

34:30.071 --> 34:33.030
- I may have to have her recommitted.

34:33.030 --> 34:33.862
- Shit.

34:37.480 --> 34:39.072
Well, did she have a relapse?

34:43.340 --> 34:44.833
- She's hallucinating again.

34:49.139 --> 34:49.973
Angry.

34:51.880 --> 34:54.373
Snapping at people, causing fights.

34:55.764 --> 34:57.500
- Damn, man.

34:57.500 --> 34:58.690
- Doing the same thing she did

34:58.690 --> 35:00.390
before we had her last instituted.

35:02.510 --> 35:04.360
- I don't even know what to say, bro.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.120
What did her doctor say?

35:10.555 --> 35:12.755
- I don't think he wants
to see her anymore.

35:14.810 --> 35:18.870
He told me if I don't have
her committed, then he will.

35:23.154 --> 35:26.410
- I mean, does she just wake up one day

35:26.410 --> 35:28.600
and something's wrong with her?

35:28.600 --> 35:30.303
Just started trippin' again?

35:34.720 --> 35:36.470
- That's the strange part about it.

35:39.890 --> 35:44.890
She acts like she's still
taking her medication.

35:48.657 --> 35:51.587
I checked the bottle
and looks about right.

36:00.080 --> 36:02.831
- You gotta figure something out, bro.

36:02.831 --> 36:04.813
You can't let her just go down the drain.

36:10.021 --> 36:12.188
(sobbing)

36:18.870 --> 36:20.820
You find out what the fuck is going on.

36:24.170 --> 36:26.320
You don't give up on
the love of your life.

36:27.550 --> 36:29.333
What the hell are you thinking about?

36:31.989 --> 36:33.389
Now you better buck up, bro.

36:35.910 --> 36:36.753
Take charge.

36:43.040 --> 36:44.363
- What if I can't?

36:50.720 --> 36:53.020
- What if aliens take
over the fucking planet?

36:55.090 --> 36:56.623
What ifs don't mean shit, bro.

37:00.676 --> 37:01.726
You take care of her.

37:04.355 --> 37:05.755
Don't be one of those dudes.

37:08.907 --> 37:09.740
- I am.

37:12.760 --> 37:15.413
Just needed to vent.

37:20.243 --> 37:21.993
- I get it, I get it.

37:27.927 --> 37:28.760
- You know,

37:33.414 --> 37:34.970
things started to get strange

37:36.680 --> 37:39.203
right after we moved
into my uncle's house.

37:42.149 --> 37:44.310
- Did the move cause some sort of trauma?

37:44.310 --> 37:48.213
Like moving to D.C. to here?

37:51.101 --> 37:51.934
- No.

37:53.520 --> 37:57.963
But ever since we moved into that house,

37:59.580 --> 38:01.443
something hasn't been right with her.

38:07.598 --> 38:08.598
- Look, man.

38:11.230 --> 38:13.083
Your uncle fell off the deep end.

38:15.490 --> 38:19.893
I don't know if it was too
much pressure from work.

38:24.850 --> 38:26.450
How could there be a connection?

38:33.013 --> 38:34.263
- I don't know.

38:35.937 --> 38:37.520
But it's not right.

38:47.424 --> 38:49.841
I gotta figure something out.

38:58.290 --> 39:00.500
I'll call you when I get a chance.

39:15.382 --> 39:16.215
Honey?

39:55.947 --> 39:58.030
Dr. Cochran called today.

39:59.304 --> 40:01.213
He told me what happened in his office.

40:06.415 --> 40:09.082
- I don't know what's happening.

40:10.909 --> 40:14.710
I get so angry and I can't control myself.

40:14.710 --> 40:17.210
- He acts like he doesn't
want to see you anymore.

40:19.170 --> 40:21.463
He's talking about having
you committed again.

40:21.463 --> 40:22.671
- What?

40:22.671 --> 40:23.504
- [Kevin] I don't--

40:23.504 --> 40:24.980
- No.

40:24.980 --> 40:29.110
Kevin, don't give up on me.

40:29.110 --> 40:31.210
- I know you've been taking your medicine.

40:35.824 --> 40:38.033
- Something's going on.

40:39.861 --> 40:41.861
And we're gonna get to the bottom of it.

40:47.240 --> 40:48.340
- So you're not gonna send me back

40:48.340 --> 40:49.556
to the hospital, right?

40:49.556 --> 40:50.389
- No, no.

40:54.183 --> 40:55.693
Just try to get some sleep.

40:56.957 --> 40:59.530
We're going somewhere in the morning.

40:59.530 --> 41:00.363
- Where?

41:01.460 --> 41:02.293
- Don't worry about it,

41:02.293 --> 41:04.040
just try not to think about it.

41:04.040 --> 41:05.590
Just get some sleep, all right?

41:10.089 --> 41:10.922
- Okay.

41:11.876 --> 41:14.543
(ominous music)

41:27.896 --> 41:30.396
(strong wind)

41:32.770 --> 41:37.083
- My name is Kevin Anderson,
and this is my wife Jessi.

41:39.107 --> 41:42.050
We came to find out some
things about my uncle.

41:42.050 --> 41:43.263
Frank Anderson.

41:45.240 --> 41:48.084
- Professor Anderson has a nephew.

41:48.084 --> 41:50.480
(chuckles)

41:50.480 --> 41:52.230
I'm sorry to hear about your uncle.

41:53.339 --> 41:54.839
He was a very intelligent man.

41:55.740 --> 41:58.603
Though, he never mentioned
he had any relatives.

41:59.910 --> 42:03.300
- Well, Uncle Frank was very private.

42:03.300 --> 42:08.113
He didn't really share things
unless you were a friend.

42:10.710 --> 42:14.173
Did he seem strange at all near the end?

42:17.190 --> 42:19.530
- Your uncle was always strange.

42:19.530 --> 42:20.997
He always kept to himself.

42:20.997 --> 42:22.997
You never knew where he was coming from.

42:24.070 --> 42:27.403
But at the end, just before
the unfortunate accident,

42:28.270 --> 42:30.623
like he seemed far more
distant than usual.

42:32.010 --> 42:34.393
- Did his mood change much?

42:35.900 --> 42:36.733
- A lot.

42:37.600 --> 42:39.363
He just seemed angry all the time.

42:40.290 --> 42:41.903
He couldn't control himself.

42:43.600 --> 42:44.700
You know, I think it started

42:44.700 --> 42:47.143
when he went to Iraq several months ago.

42:49.214 --> 42:51.063
He made the find of a lifetime.

42:52.610 --> 42:54.670
We research scientists are always looking

42:54.670 --> 42:56.363
for the next great discovery.

42:57.760 --> 42:59.823
Funding is hard to come by these days.

43:00.750 --> 43:01.640
- Yeah.

43:01.640 --> 43:03.240
- But when he found this statue,

43:04.580 --> 43:07.250
he just got very, very strange.

43:07.250 --> 43:10.883
Like he went off the deep end, really.

43:11.880 --> 43:14.303
- Do you know anything about the statue?

43:18.363 --> 43:19.560
- No.

43:19.560 --> 43:23.773
Just he and his assistant,
um, Russell McGinty,

43:24.780 --> 43:26.583
kept everyone else away from it.

43:27.520 --> 43:30.610
The vault was off limits
once that thing got here.

43:30.610 --> 43:31.850
- So how--

43:31.850 --> 43:34.950
- Is there any way that
we can get in touch

43:34.950 --> 43:36.653
with this McGinty?

43:39.210 --> 43:41.823
- He hasn't been to work
since your uncle passed.

43:43.150 --> 43:45.470
I guess he's taking it kind of hard.

43:45.470 --> 43:46.573
But I can't blame him.

43:48.090 --> 43:49.500
Must've called him a million times,

43:49.500 --> 43:51.300
but he won't pick up his cell phone.

43:53.380 --> 43:57.470
- Is there a um, is there
a number or an address

43:57.470 --> 43:58.303
that I can have?

43:58.303 --> 43:59.136
Anything?

44:00.530 --> 44:01.950
- I can get you an address.

44:11.824 --> 44:13.522
Do me a favor.

44:13.522 --> 44:15.900
If you speak to him,
tell him he could take

44:15.900 --> 44:17.855
all the time he needs.

44:17.855 --> 44:18.688
- Cool.

44:18.688 --> 44:19.521
- Excuse me, but how did--

44:19.521 --> 44:22.670
- Thank you for all your help.

44:22.670 --> 44:25.553
If we get in touch with
him, we'll let you know.

44:27.580 --> 44:29.030
- I have to get back to work.

44:29.030 --> 44:31.200
Once again, sorry for your loss.

44:31.200 --> 44:32.033
- Thank you.

44:37.174 --> 44:38.007
Thank you.

44:44.251 --> 44:45.099
- Hey.

44:45.099 --> 44:46.749
Why did you cut me off like that?

44:48.176 --> 44:49.910
- He was lying.

44:49.910 --> 44:50.860
Now do you want them to come and take

44:50.860 --> 44:52.380
that thing out of house
before we figure out

44:52.380 --> 44:53.630
what's going on with you?

44:55.197 --> 44:56.030
Do you trust me?

44:57.180 --> 45:00.370
- So, so what are we gonna do then?

45:00.370 --> 45:02.380
- We're gonna pay that assistant a visit.

45:02.380 --> 45:03.360
Maybe he can shed some light

45:03.360 --> 45:05.780
on that thing that's in our house.

45:05.780 --> 45:07.768
- I'm scared, Kevin.

45:07.768 --> 45:09.660
I don't want to end up like your uncle.

45:09.660 --> 45:11.824
I won't, I won't.

45:11.824 --> 45:12.824
- You won't.

45:14.004 --> 45:15.104
I'm gonna protect you.

45:16.150 --> 45:17.556
When we get there, I'm going in alone.

45:17.556 --> 45:18.389
- What?

45:18.389 --> 45:19.222
- [Kevin] You're staying in the car.

45:19.222 --> 45:20.055
- Why?

45:20.055 --> 45:21.560
- The guy has been M.I.A.
for almost three weeks.

45:21.560 --> 45:23.540
I'm going in alone.

45:23.540 --> 45:24.373
All right?

45:41.220 --> 45:42.630
All right.

45:42.630 --> 45:45.342
Wait here, I'll handle this.

45:45.342 --> 45:46.175
- Okay.

45:48.787 --> 45:49.704
Be careful.

45:51.156 --> 45:51.989
- Yeah.

46:14.113 --> 46:16.780
(ominous music)

46:25.221 --> 46:27.471
(knocking)

46:31.971 --> 46:34.221
(creaking)

46:37.209 --> 46:38.809
I'm looking for Russell McGinty.

46:41.670 --> 46:42.503
- Who are you?

46:43.579 --> 46:45.693
- [Kevin] I am Kevin Anderson.

46:47.520 --> 46:48.470
- What do you want?

46:50.950 --> 46:52.430
- [Kevin] I'm trying to find out

46:52.430 --> 46:53.963
what happened to my uncle.

46:55.910 --> 46:58.580
- Get out of here, somebody
could've followed you here.

46:58.580 --> 46:59.880
- [Kevin] Are you Russell?

47:03.610 --> 47:05.473
I need answers.

47:06.550 --> 47:09.830
Something is happening to my wife,

47:09.830 --> 47:11.780
and I think it's connected to my uncle.

47:14.950 --> 47:15.783
Please.

47:18.890 --> 47:19.723
Please.

47:22.770 --> 47:23.603
- I'm him.

47:26.570 --> 47:28.140
Come in.

47:28.140 --> 47:29.740
They could've followed you here.

47:42.358 --> 47:43.243
- Mhm, thank you.

47:48.230 --> 47:49.680
- Frank was your uncle?

47:49.680 --> 47:50.513
- Yeah.

47:52.380 --> 47:55.513
You worked in his department
at the university, right?

47:56.670 --> 47:57.503
- Yes.

47:58.780 --> 48:01.460
Professor Anderson was a genius,

48:01.460 --> 48:02.383
best in our field.

48:03.446 --> 48:06.113
(ominous music)

48:11.130 --> 48:12.847
- So, what happened to him?

48:13.890 --> 48:16.557
(ominous music)

48:27.090 --> 48:28.790
Is there something wrong with you?

48:29.909 --> 48:32.576
(ominous music)

48:44.620 --> 48:46.692
Why are you living like this?

48:46.692 --> 48:49.359
(ominous music)

48:57.650 --> 48:59.550
- He went to Baghdad seven months ago.

49:02.670 --> 49:04.570
There was a Babylonian artifact

49:04.570 --> 49:07.063
that was having trouble clearing customs.

49:08.510 --> 49:11.197
He wanted to bring it back himself,

49:11.197 --> 49:12.030
thought it would be important

49:12.030 --> 49:14.210
for the university to study.

49:14.210 --> 49:15.810
So when he arrived to Baghdad

49:17.610 --> 49:19.650
to examine the artifact,

49:19.650 --> 49:21.300
he realized it wasn't Babylonian.

49:22.614 --> 49:23.813
It was something different.

49:25.400 --> 49:27.650
Early carbon dating showed it to be around

49:27.650 --> 49:28.773
50,000 years old.

49:34.560 --> 49:36.513
That predates the Sumerians.

49:37.420 --> 49:39.330
This was the oldest artifact

49:39.330 --> 49:40.843
to ever be uncovered.

49:43.270 --> 49:45.120
The Iraqis didn't know what they had.

49:49.020 --> 49:51.250
He brought it back pretending that it was

49:51.250 --> 49:52.650
what they believed it to be.

49:55.060 --> 49:56.060
Babylonian monolith.

49:58.680 --> 50:00.630
- What happened after that?

50:01.858 --> 50:04.525
(ominous music)

50:19.073 --> 50:22.120
- He wouldn't let anybody else examine it.

50:22.120 --> 50:23.363
He did it all himself.

50:26.330 --> 50:28.530
That's when he started acting strange,

50:28.530 --> 50:31.943
and something was truly wrong
with Professor Anderson.

50:34.620 --> 50:35.913
He became paranoid.

50:38.270 --> 50:40.443
Delusional, started seeing things.

50:46.500 --> 50:48.300
- So why didn't you try to help him?

50:49.670 --> 50:52.596
You said that you admired him.

50:52.596 --> 50:55.263
(ominous music)

51:04.907 --> 51:06.300
- He wouldn't let me.

51:06.300 --> 51:08.657
I thought he was going
crazy, but he wasn't.

51:10.474 --> 51:12.891
(whispering)

51:14.194 --> 51:15.527
He wasn't crazy.

51:17.117 --> 51:18.450
He wasn't crazy.

51:19.535 --> 51:21.512
He wasn't crazy.

51:21.512 --> 51:22.845
He wasn't crazy.

51:24.072 --> 51:26.822
He wasn't crazy, he wasn't crazy.

51:28.238 --> 51:30.988
He wasn't crazy, he wasn't crazy.

51:32.067 --> 51:32.900
- [Kevin] Russell.

51:32.900 --> 51:34.256
- He wasn't crazy.

51:34.256 --> 51:35.089
- Hey.

51:36.100 --> 51:39.017
- He wasn't crazy, he wasn't crazy.

51:40.250 --> 51:41.500
- Get a hold of yourself!

51:44.099 --> 51:45.663
- He wasn't crazy.

51:45.663 --> 51:46.496
- Look.

51:48.662 --> 51:53.263
I need to know what happened to my uncle.

51:56.600 --> 51:57.433
I need to know.

51:58.508 --> 52:01.175
(ominous music)

52:15.821 --> 52:18.123
- One night he went home.

52:18.123 --> 52:19.113
And never came back.

52:21.700 --> 52:24.853
Found out the next day he killed himself.

52:27.560 --> 52:29.160
It crushed me, couldn't believe

52:30.020 --> 52:31.390
how someone so brilliant

52:31.390 --> 52:33.263
could just kill themselves.

52:38.140 --> 52:39.570
So I went down to the vault

52:39.570 --> 52:41.223
and examined the artifact myself.

52:44.090 --> 52:45.290
- What did you find out?

52:48.770 --> 52:49.603
- First...

52:50.830 --> 52:54.160
The artifact description
of what he brought back

52:54.160 --> 52:55.610
wasn't what was in the vault.

52:58.380 --> 53:00.703
It looked like a monolith, but it wasn't.

53:02.980 --> 53:05.310
The monolith was just a case.

53:05.310 --> 53:08.413
It was made of some kind
of silica based material.

53:12.870 --> 53:15.033
Someone hid the true form,

53:16.740 --> 53:19.843
and Frank just revealed it.

53:23.840 --> 53:26.860
From his notes, he found out

53:26.860 --> 53:28.483
it was just a statue underneath.

53:30.620 --> 53:31.483
- A statue.

53:32.410 --> 53:33.577
- Yeah.

53:33.577 --> 53:36.167
A monstrously grotesque statue.

53:43.557 --> 53:46.390
- [Kevin] Is that what killed him?

53:50.193 --> 53:54.150
- After he touched it,
things started happening.

53:54.150 --> 53:56.282
- [Kevin] So you think from touch--

53:56.282 --> 53:58.477
- Oh God, I touched it too.

53:58.477 --> 54:00.227
I fuckin' touched it.

54:02.009 --> 54:03.926
(sobs)

54:10.001 --> 54:13.033
- Can we fix this?

54:18.470 --> 54:21.603
My wife touched that statue.

54:33.360 --> 54:38.360
Is there any way we can save her?

54:41.379 --> 54:42.796
Is there any, any way?

54:52.210 --> 54:53.393
- Your wife's dead.

54:54.689 --> 54:56.272
You can't save her.

54:58.452 --> 55:00.223
I'm dead too.

55:00.223 --> 55:03.113
(strange ringing)

55:03.113 --> 55:05.780
(ominous music)

55:09.291 --> 55:11.791
- [Kevin] There has to be s...

55:15.946 --> 55:16.779
- Leave!

55:18.854 --> 55:20.585
- Put that down.

55:20.585 --> 55:22.492
- Fuckin' leave.

55:22.492 --> 55:26.007
(strange ringing)

55:26.007 --> 55:28.424
I'm saving your fuckin' life.

55:37.869 --> 55:39.865
(door slams)

55:39.865 --> 55:42.640
(strange ringing)

55:42.640 --> 55:45.307
(ominous music)

56:01.378 --> 56:03.711
(gun fires)

56:13.767 --> 56:16.684
(mysterious music)

57:16.847 --> 57:19.014
(banging)

57:47.344 --> 57:49.419
- Knock, knock.

57:49.419 --> 57:51.627
Well, hello there.

57:51.627 --> 57:54.377
You are a waste of fucking space.

57:55.898 --> 57:57.786
A waste of space.

57:57.786 --> 58:00.387
What are you still doing around?

58:00.387 --> 58:04.249
You couldn't even kill
yourself, you're so weak.

58:04.249 --> 58:05.082
What?

58:07.307 --> 58:08.724
What do you mean?

58:09.982 --> 58:11.149
Who are you...

58:13.355 --> 58:16.752
Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock.

58:16.752 --> 58:18.781
Cut your fucking wrists.

58:18.781 --> 58:20.080
Do it, just do it.

58:20.080 --> 58:23.547
Your husband doesn't
even like you. (laughs)

58:23.547 --> 58:25.988
You might as well die.

58:25.988 --> 58:28.260
We're going to kill you.

58:28.260 --> 58:30.260
You're all going to die.

58:33.242 --> 58:34.075
What?

58:37.045 --> 58:39.550
I'm fuckin' crazy, this is just great,

58:39.550 --> 58:42.025
I'm just crazy, right?

58:42.025 --> 58:44.966
Now I'm talking to myself.

58:44.966 --> 58:46.519
You think you're crazy?

58:46.519 --> 58:49.273
Look at you, look at you.

58:49.273 --> 58:51.198
You think you're talking to yourself?

58:51.198 --> 58:52.489
Do you?

58:52.489 --> 58:55.313
You're so fucking stupid!

58:55.313 --> 58:57.188
You're so stupid.

58:57.188 --> 58:58.619
I'm talking to you.

58:58.619 --> 59:01.686
Yes, Jessi, I'm talking to you.

59:01.686 --> 59:03.030
Your husband thinks you're crazy,

59:03.030 --> 59:05.733
they all think you're fucking crazy.

59:06.697 --> 59:11.380
Just do it! (laughs)

59:15.732 --> 59:17.104
What are you doing?

59:17.104 --> 59:19.940
(laughing)

59:19.940 --> 59:20.773
You see?

59:20.773 --> 59:23.957
You don't even give a shit about yourself.

59:23.957 --> 59:28.957
We are inside your head
and you don't even know it.

59:28.991 --> 59:32.424
We're in control, we're in control,

59:32.424 --> 59:34.329
and you think you are.

59:34.329 --> 59:36.163
You think you're in control.

59:36.163 --> 59:37.580
You know nothing.

59:40.838 --> 59:42.334
(sobbing)

59:42.334 --> 59:45.102
Why are you doing this to me?

59:45.102 --> 59:47.019
No, this is, this is...

59:50.326 --> 59:54.085
I'm taking my medication,
I'm taking my medication.

59:54.085 --> 59:55.254
This is in my imagination.

59:55.254 --> 59:56.200
I'm dreaming, right?

59:56.200 --> 59:57.060
I'm dreaming.

59:57.060 --> 59:58.802
(laughing)

59:58.802 --> 01:00:00.441
You think you're dreaming?

01:00:00.441 --> 01:00:02.617
Stop talking to yourself.

01:00:02.617 --> 01:00:04.277
You stupid girl.

01:00:04.277 --> 01:00:07.055
You can't fix this with pills.

01:00:07.055 --> 01:00:09.186
You think that doctor's helping you?

01:00:09.186 --> 01:00:11.163
Look, look, look, look.

01:00:11.163 --> 01:00:12.051
Look.

01:00:12.051 --> 01:00:14.570
You're talking to yourself in the mirror.

01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:16.133
Fucking idiot.

01:00:16.133 --> 01:00:19.376
You need to slit your wrists now.

01:00:19.376 --> 01:00:20.543
Slit them now!

01:00:21.424 --> 01:00:24.424
Cut your wrists, just let it all go.

01:00:25.285 --> 01:00:27.576
Just let it all go.

01:00:27.576 --> 01:00:30.243
(ominous music)

01:00:33.243 --> 01:00:35.481
(sobbing)

01:00:35.481 --> 01:00:36.562
No.

01:00:36.562 --> 01:00:38.860
Please, don't hurt me.

01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:39.777
No, no, no.

01:00:41.792 --> 01:00:44.209
I'm not crazy, I'm not crazy.

01:00:52.393 --> 01:00:53.393
Who are you?

01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:55.470
Who are you?

01:00:57.660 --> 01:00:59.412
Who are you?

01:00:59.412 --> 01:01:02.079
(ominous music)

01:01:34.036 --> 01:01:35.453
- Hey, let me go!

01:01:38.104 --> 01:01:38.937
What are you talking about?

01:01:38.937 --> 01:01:39.770
Let me go!

01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:41.204
- You told me lies!

01:01:41.204 --> 01:01:44.284
- Let me go, I'll call security.

01:01:44.284 --> 01:01:45.293
- I'm gonna kill you.

01:01:45.293 --> 01:01:46.126
Tell me.

01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:52.917
- Let me go.

01:01:52.917 --> 01:01:55.167
(coughing)

01:02:10.741 --> 01:02:11.574
I'm sorry.

01:02:12.751 --> 01:02:15.001
(coughing)

01:02:25.041 --> 01:02:26.958
- I can't find my wife.

01:02:31.003 --> 01:02:33.610
This thing is killing her, isn't it?

01:02:38.751 --> 01:02:40.780
- I don't know.

01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:42.350
I didn't even know about the artifact

01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:43.700
until it killed your uncle.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:46.850
I didn't even know about you.

01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:50.200
- Why did you put it in my uncle's house?

01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:53.978
Russell didn't put it there.

01:02:53.978 --> 01:02:55.395
It had to be you.

01:02:58.010 --> 01:02:59.723
- I didn't know what to do with it.

01:03:00.765 --> 01:03:02.583
I knew there was something wrong with it.

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.370
I had to get it out of there.

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.650
I thought it'd be safe
at your uncle's place.

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.900
Until I could find a
better place to put it.

01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:16.190
No one could touch it,
it had to be put away.

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:21.987
- You put it right in my wife's hands.

01:03:21.987 --> 01:03:24.040
- I said I didn't know about you.

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:26.588
He never talked about his relatives.

01:03:26.588 --> 01:03:27.943
He didn't even mention you.

01:03:29.559 --> 01:03:31.809
(coughing)

01:03:33.907 --> 01:03:35.543
- How do I save my wife?

01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:39.283
What can I do?

01:03:40.926 --> 01:03:42.593
How do I destroy this thing?

01:03:45.490 --> 01:03:48.490
- I talked to every
scholar, every historian,

01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:51.930
every archeologist, every anthropologist

01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:53.630
who might know something about it.

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.700
None of them knew this thing even existed.

01:04:10.839 --> 01:04:13.670
If you're gonna move it, use plastic.

01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:16.170
That's what I did, it didn't affect me.

01:04:16.170 --> 01:04:17.003
Don't touch it.

01:04:21.212 --> 01:04:22.306
- You!

01:04:22.306 --> 01:04:23.865
You did this to us!

01:04:23.865 --> 01:04:27.708
You killed my uncle, you killed my wife!

01:04:27.708 --> 01:04:29.327
You did this.

01:04:29.327 --> 01:04:32.077
(dramatic music)

01:04:35.412 --> 01:04:37.046
- I'm sorry.

01:04:37.046 --> 01:04:37.879
(ominous music)

01:04:57.987 --> 01:05:01.737
(muffled voice transmission)

01:05:19.695 --> 01:05:23.445
(muffled voice transmission)

01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:49.847
- Why did you run off like that?

01:05:52.723 --> 01:05:57.723
- I'm sorry, I saw something
outside of the car.

01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:06.653
Am I losing my mind?

01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:15.263
Did you see that guy
and get any information?

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:21.133
- I think he...

01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:26.663
I think he killed himself.

01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:33.403
It's that statue causing all of this.

01:06:37.848 --> 01:06:40.848
I don't know what to do to help you.

01:06:44.777 --> 01:06:47.023
I'm gonna figure something out though.

01:06:48.277 --> 01:06:51.277
But I really don't know what to do.

01:06:54.302 --> 01:06:55.726
- Am I goin crazy?

01:06:55.726 --> 01:06:56.559
- No.

01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.862
(whirring noise)

01:07:01.009 --> 01:07:02.676
What are you seeing?

01:07:04.463 --> 01:07:06.773
- These faces.

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:12.273
They just, they keep looking at me.

01:07:14.102 --> 01:07:15.543
They appear out of nowhere.

01:07:19.330 --> 01:07:21.573
I think they're trying
to tell me something.

01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:24.570
I think...

01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:29.570
- We're gonna beat this.

01:07:33.318 --> 01:07:34.735
I promise we are.

01:07:40.367 --> 01:07:43.367
- I have something else to tell you.

01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:50.333
I'm pregnant.

01:07:52.181 --> 01:07:54.222
(sobbing)

01:07:54.222 --> 01:07:56.889
(ominous music)

01:08:08.247 --> 01:08:10.177
- I'm gonna keep this baby safe too.

01:08:52.424 --> 01:08:53.256
(car door shutting)

01:08:58.125 --> 01:08:58.957
(car door shutting)

01:09:07.854 --> 01:09:09.850
- I'm not ready, I'm not ready.

01:09:09.850 --> 01:09:11.268
- Come on, Jessi.

01:09:18.506 --> 01:09:20.113
Now let's get rid of this thing,

01:09:21.197 --> 01:09:23.167
and let's end this.

01:09:23.167 --> 01:09:24.000
For good.

01:09:31.104 --> 01:09:32.529
You can do it.

01:09:32.529 --> 01:09:37.529
It's time to let go.

01:09:45.049 --> 01:09:47.716
(ominous music)

01:10:00.603 --> 01:10:01.436
It's over.

01:10:03.972 --> 01:10:05.472
It's finally over.

01:10:10.005 --> 01:10:12.505
(strong wind)

01:10:36.655 --> 01:10:38.705
Rise and shine.

01:10:38.705 --> 01:10:39.955
- Good morning.

01:10:42.151 --> 01:10:44.318
- [Kevin] How do you feel?

01:10:45.403 --> 01:10:49.130
- I feel really good, actually.

01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:49.963
Yeah.

01:10:51.810 --> 01:10:53.150
- Great.

01:10:53.150 --> 01:10:55.683
Um, we were supposed
to have dinner tonight.

01:10:57.210 --> 01:10:58.043
- Mm.

01:10:58.043 --> 01:10:59.957
- What do you think?

01:10:59.957 --> 01:11:00.790
You want to?

01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:04.390
- Yeah.

01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:06.959
Let's have dinner, with
Matthew and Phyllis?

01:11:06.959 --> 01:11:08.490
- Yeah.

01:11:08.490 --> 01:11:10.150
- Oh.

01:11:10.150 --> 01:11:12.560
You can invite Jimmy and Asia too.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.507
- Now let's not get carried--

01:11:13.507 --> 01:11:14.907
- I feel really good, Kevin.

01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:18.770
He's your best friend.

01:11:18.770 --> 01:11:20.970
You never get to spend
enough time with him.

01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:24.463
I say, the more the merrier.

01:11:28.290 --> 01:11:29.640
- All right.

01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:31.090
I'll invite Jimmy and Asia too.

01:11:31.090 --> 01:11:32.249
- Okay.

01:11:32.249 --> 01:11:33.805
Good.

01:11:33.805 --> 01:11:36.058
- All right, I'm off to work.

01:11:36.058 --> 01:11:37.558
- All right, baby.

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:39.793
Have a good day.

01:11:41.210 --> 01:11:42.120
- I'll see you tonight.

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:42.953
- All right.

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:54.701
- Phyllis and I, we just
got back from Tennessee,

01:11:54.701 --> 01:11:55.770
we were up in the mountains.

01:11:55.770 --> 01:12:00.030
Let me tell you, it was
absolutely beautiful.

01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:01.860
I mean there are places
you can look out and see

01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:03.250
like five or six states,

01:12:03.250 --> 01:12:05.128
I mean it's crazy.

01:12:05.128 --> 01:12:06.536
- Oh!

01:12:06.536 --> 01:12:09.221
I love your wife's cooking.

01:12:09.221 --> 01:12:11.666
- I didn't know you knew
how to make fried chicken.

01:12:11.666 --> 01:12:13.610
(laughing)

01:12:13.610 --> 01:12:15.788
- She is full of surprises.

01:12:15.788 --> 01:12:17.160
(chuckling)

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.503
- I can make anything.

01:12:19.708 --> 01:12:21.337
As long as I have my ipad.

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:23.517
- So how do you guys like the house?

01:12:25.484 --> 01:12:28.897
- Um, well, it's been interesting

01:12:30.915 --> 01:12:32.053
living here.

01:12:32.053 --> 01:12:32.968
Um

01:12:32.968 --> 01:12:35.390
Well, Frank did a lot
of work on the place.

01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:36.223
- Yeah.

01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:38.387
It was an apartment,

01:12:38.387 --> 01:12:41.802
and he restored it back
to its original condition.

01:12:41.802 --> 01:12:44.330
I believe it was 1850s.

01:12:44.330 --> 01:12:47.150
I mean, he moved walls, he took out doors,

01:12:47.150 --> 01:12:48.217
he did everything.

01:12:48.217 --> 01:12:50.851
And this place is amazing.

01:12:50.851 --> 01:12:53.648
(lighthearted piano music)

01:12:53.648 --> 01:12:55.365
- The music of yours...

01:12:55.365 --> 01:12:57.615
(laughing)

01:12:59.144 --> 01:13:01.066
- So you look good.

01:13:01.066 --> 01:13:02.530
Very happy things are going well

01:13:02.530 --> 01:13:04.113
for the two of you.

01:13:07.170 --> 01:13:09.424
- They just have patience.

01:13:09.424 --> 01:13:11.076
Working things out.

01:13:11.076 --> 01:13:13.326
Oh, it's the best for them.

01:13:14.544 --> 01:13:16.314
- [Matthew] Here, here.

01:13:16.314 --> 01:13:19.897
(lighthearted piano music)

01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:29.020
- So, when my sister passed away,

01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:31.970
I was all kinds of empty.

01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:35.170
It was the closest thing
to me and my family.

01:13:35.170 --> 01:13:36.470
Me and my mom weren't that close,

01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:38.723
and my big sister was my anchor.

01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:42.640
But enough about me.

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:44.610
I want to know more about his uncle

01:13:44.610 --> 01:13:47.740
and what do you think happened to him?

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:53.503
- He seemed very obsessed
those last few days.

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:57.160
He kept saying that he had a message

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.970
that he wanted to tell,

01:13:58.970 --> 01:14:01.070
and that he had figured out the cuneiform.

01:14:02.010 --> 01:14:03.853
It was like he had this
thought in his mind

01:14:03.853 --> 01:14:05.453
that he couldn't get out.

01:14:07.145 --> 01:14:09.320
This old man that I've known for 25 years

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.703
deteriorate into nothing.

01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:14.363
It was very sad to see.

01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:21.997
- We know what killed him.

01:14:23.943 --> 01:14:25.993
We also know what killed Russell McGinty.

01:14:27.230 --> 01:14:29.013
- Do you mean that assistant

01:14:29.013 --> 01:14:31.700
that used to work with
Uncle Frank at the lab?

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:34.113
- I saw something on the news about that.

01:14:35.170 --> 01:14:37.023
He committed suicide too.

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:41.273
- This might sound really strange,

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:45.590
but we found this artifact in the house

01:14:47.919 --> 01:14:50.210
and it's been causing
me some serious problems

01:14:50.210 --> 01:14:51.990
over the last few days.

01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:54.290
- So you think that's
what killed Uncle Frank?

01:14:55.382 --> 01:14:56.513
An artifact?

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:00.386
- That seems a little bit unrealistic.

01:15:00.386 --> 01:15:02.560
(laughing)

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:06.117
- We told you that it would sound strange.

01:15:08.418 --> 01:15:11.018
- I don't really know how
to wrap my head around it.

01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:15.543
It's been kind of a mind trip, really.

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:20.323
- How do you know what
killed this Russell fellow?

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:23.953
- I was there.

01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:27.390
- Wait, what, what?

01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:28.540
You saw him get killed?

01:15:31.158 --> 01:15:32.208
- It was this statue.

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:36.934
It made him do it.

01:15:36.934 --> 01:15:39.184
(laughing)

01:15:40.893 --> 01:15:44.483
- Did you just say the
statue made him do it?

01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:47.800
You two been taking medication?

01:15:49.774 --> 01:15:52.720
- I was on the other side of
his door when it happened.

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.720
- Look, we had a great evening,

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:56.471
but we have to get going.

01:15:56.471 --> 01:15:58.726
- Okay, okay, all right.

01:15:58.726 --> 01:15:59.559
Let's go, come on.
- Let's go.

01:15:59.559 --> 01:16:01.892
- Come on, come on, come on.

01:16:11.988 --> 01:16:13.759
- Let me get your coat.

01:16:13.759 --> 01:16:15.161
- Good to see you again, Matt.

01:16:15.161 --> 01:16:15.994
Take care.

01:16:16.969 --> 01:16:18.552
So good to see you.

01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:21.074
- [Phyllis] Be careful.

01:16:21.074 --> 01:16:21.974
- [Jessi] You too.

01:16:31.499 --> 01:16:34.399
- [Matthew] Thanks so much
for dinner, that was great.

01:16:34.399 --> 01:16:36.791
(laughing)

01:16:36.791 --> 01:16:38.683
- Jimmy and that damn fried chicken.

01:16:38.683 --> 01:16:40.933
(laughing)

01:16:45.828 --> 01:16:49.000
- It was really good to see them though.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.580
Jimmy picked a good woman.

01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:51.473
I like Asia.

01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:57.010
I think it got a little
weird towards the end,

01:16:57.010 --> 01:16:59.500
you know, when you started talking about--

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:00.333
- I know.

01:17:00.333 --> 01:17:01.410
Sorry about that.

01:17:03.330 --> 01:17:05.303
But that's behind us now.

01:17:06.190 --> 01:17:08.190
We need to look forward.

01:17:09.354 --> 01:17:11.007
Focus on ourselves.

01:17:11.007 --> 01:17:11.840
- Yeah.

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:15.908
What about if we go shopping

01:17:15.908 --> 01:17:16.741
tomorrow for the house?

01:17:16.741 --> 01:17:17.574
(strange ringing)

01:17:18.563 --> 01:17:19.896
- You want to spend some money?

01:17:19.896 --> 01:17:20.729
- Yeah.

01:17:22.044 --> 01:17:23.993
I think we deserve it, don't we?

01:17:23.993 --> 01:17:26.795
(strange ringing)

01:17:26.795 --> 01:17:29.462
(ominous music)

01:18:21.216 --> 01:18:23.383
- [Demonic voice] Can you hear us?

01:18:26.364 --> 01:18:29.447
Your people have destroyed our place.

01:18:36.959 --> 01:18:37.792
- Jessi?

01:18:42.984 --> 01:18:43.817
Jessi!

01:18:45.913 --> 01:18:48.580
(ominous music)

01:19:00.428 --> 01:19:02.730
(sirens blaring)

01:19:02.730 --> 01:19:03.563
- Charging.

01:19:06.487 --> 01:19:07.320
Clear.

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:09.487
We're clear, clear, shock!

01:19:11.406 --> 01:19:14.156
(sirens blaring)

01:19:15.558 --> 01:19:17.239
Clear, clear!

01:19:17.239 --> 01:19:19.038
Shocking.

01:19:19.038 --> 01:19:21.705
(ominous music)

01:19:29.337 --> 01:19:30.922
Clear.

01:19:30.922 --> 01:19:31.755
Shocking.

01:19:34.565 --> 01:19:39.565
Start CPR, let's go.

01:19:45.201 --> 01:19:46.821
Clear, clear.

01:19:46.821 --> 01:19:47.654
Shocking.

01:19:48.916 --> 01:19:51.666
(dramatic music)

01:20:12.710 --> 01:20:15.673
- [Female EMT] Did you find her like this?

01:20:15.673 --> 01:20:17.256
- No, I don't know.

01:20:18.356 --> 01:20:19.189
- [Male EMT] What happened?

01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:20.979
- I don't know!

01:20:20.979 --> 01:20:21.812
- [Male EMT] Come on, man.

01:20:21.812 --> 01:20:22.645
Help your wife.

01:20:22.645 --> 01:20:23.728
- I'm trying!

01:20:34.489 --> 01:20:36.163
- Just don't leave.

01:20:36.163 --> 01:20:38.020
All right, we're gonna charge.

01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:38.853
Charging.

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:42.753
Clear, shocking.

01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:46.013
- What was that?

01:20:46.013 --> 01:20:47.013
- Start CPR.

01:20:48.606 --> 01:20:49.730
- What is that?

01:20:49.730 --> 01:20:53.672
- [Demonic voice] We shared this world.

01:20:53.672 --> 01:20:56.339
(ominous music)

01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:02.937
We will remove you from your measure.

01:21:04.606 --> 01:21:06.939
(screaming)

01:21:09.932 --> 01:21:11.932
This is not yours alone.

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:20.340
You destroy where we live too.

01:21:26.431 --> 01:21:28.348
It cannot be tolerated.

01:21:30.535 --> 01:21:31.702
We are coming.

01:21:34.139 --> 01:21:35.722
This is your edict.

01:21:41.743 --> 01:21:45.410
(Jessi speaking in tongues)

01:21:55.997 --> 01:21:56.830
- Jessi.

01:21:57.675 --> 01:21:58.675
Is she okay?

01:22:02.061 --> 01:22:02.894
- [Male EMT] Did you see that shit?

01:22:02.894 --> 01:22:05.477
Do you know what just happened?

01:22:35.472 --> 01:22:38.305
(strange ringing)

01:25:45.347 --> 01:25:48.533
(music fades)
