00:16.685 --> 00:18.895
I don't think I can do this again.

00:19.187 --> 00:21.773
You can if you resist, Eugene.

00:21.898 --> 00:25.402
Show the machine you don't belong
here, and the secret door will open.

00:33.743 --> 00:35.453
Resist.

00:38.790 --> 00:42.043
Eugene, <i>nein.</i>

00:42.127 --> 00:43.128
What the heck?

00:45.630 --> 00:46.631
Ew.

00:48.383 --> 00:49.384
No!

00:55.348 --> 00:58.351
That's right. Resist the pattern, Eugene.

01:03.606 --> 01:05.567
You can kiss me if you want to.

01:07.152 --> 01:10.155
Don't do it, Eugene.

01:10.280 --> 01:11.656
I'm good.

01:15.326 --> 01:17.495
You don't want to?

01:18.204 --> 01:20.790
You? Eugene Root? You're too good for me?

01:21.458 --> 01:23.084
No, no. I didn't mean that. No, wait!

01:28.965 --> 01:31.092
Kiss me. Please.

01:32.343 --> 01:33.470
I'm begging you.

01:36.639 --> 01:38.016
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

01:39.184 --> 01:41.770
If I kiss you, you kill yourself.

01:41.853 --> 01:44.856
If I don't kiss you, you kill yourself.

01:46.191 --> 01:49.194
We're friends, Tracy.
I just want you to be okay.

01:53.782 --> 01:54.866
We're friends.

01:56.117 --> 01:58.119
That's all I wanted to hear. Thank you.

02:01.331 --> 02:04.667
That should open the secret...

02:05.543 --> 02:07.504
You still like me, though, right?

02:09.047 --> 02:12.050
Like, "like me," like me?

02:13.176 --> 02:14.969
Yeah, of course.

02:16.888 --> 02:17.889
I can tell.

02:20.767 --> 02:21.768
Show me.

02:22.268 --> 02:23.853
- Tracy...
- Come on, Eugene.

02:23.937 --> 02:25.271
You said we're friends.

02:26.439 --> 02:27.440
Show me.

02:36.449 --> 02:37.450
Ew.

02:38.117 --> 02:40.161
That was, like... Ugh.

02:40.245 --> 02:43.790
Feel like my eyes are gonna barf.

02:43.873 --> 02:45.583
Do you like my hair like this?

02:46.751 --> 02:47.919
You know what, Tracy?

02:49.796 --> 02:51.381
You're mean.

02:51.464 --> 02:53.049
What?

02:53.925 --> 02:58.555
Yeah, you're mean
and conceited, and you use people.

02:58.763 --> 03:00.390
You are not a nice person.

03:00.473 --> 03:02.016
No, you're not a nice person!

03:02.100 --> 03:05.562
God! I cannot believe
you'd say this to me right now.

03:05.645 --> 03:07.939
I'm gonna kill myself,
and it's going to be your fault.

03:08.022 --> 03:10.316
No. It won't.

03:10.984 --> 03:12.235
Tracy, if you're so shallow

03:12.318 --> 03:13.444
that you need to commit suicide

03:13.528 --> 03:16.114
to get people's attention, go ahead.

03:17.574 --> 03:21.035
But it'll be your fault, not mine.

03:25.790 --> 03:27.792
Let's get out of here.

03:29.878 --> 03:31.045
Damn it. What else?

03:39.387 --> 03:41.472
Who the hell is that?

03:43.892 --> 03:46.060
Troop Leader Pedro?

03:46.728 --> 03:49.314
Haven't thought about you in years.

03:56.988 --> 04:00.825
Remember when we went
on that camping trip?

04:02.493 --> 04:04.787
We went into the woods to collect firewood,

04:04.871 --> 04:07.248
and I told you "Never touch me again"?

04:11.127 --> 04:12.211
I meant it.

04:17.300 --> 04:20.345
<i>Ja,</i> good boy. That should do it.

04:22.722 --> 04:23.932
I don't understand.

04:24.015 --> 04:25.183
Well, who else is there?

04:28.478 --> 04:29.604
Unless...

04:38.738 --> 04:39.822
Dad?

04:47.205 --> 04:49.040
Look at what you did, Eugene.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.214
Look at what you did to your Mom...

04:56.547 --> 04:57.882
...and to me.

04:58.341 --> 04:59.384
I'm so sorry.

05:01.010 --> 05:02.887
What can I do? How can I fix it?

05:09.644 --> 05:11.562
You can finish the job.

05:16.025 --> 05:17.276
Finish the job!

05:21.447 --> 05:22.490
No.

05:24.993 --> 05:26.869
I'm just a kid.

05:27.078 --> 05:29.330
I got scared and I messed up,
but I'm still just a kid.

05:30.915 --> 05:33.960
I'm sorry that you're sad,
but I'm not gonna shoot myself,

05:34.085 --> 05:36.212
and I'm not gonna apologize
for being your son.

05:42.385 --> 05:43.428
Come here.

05:53.229 --> 05:54.439
I love you.

05:58.276 --> 06:00.111
I should've always said that.

06:08.161 --> 06:09.245
I love you, too, Dad.

06:16.085 --> 06:17.128
Yes!

07:10.014 --> 07:11.349
<i>Get on your knees.</i>

07:14.352 --> 07:16.437
Drop it. Disarm.

07:16.521 --> 07:18.523
The gun. Saber.

07:21.776 --> 07:24.529
Let's go for a drive.

07:26.239 --> 07:28.783
<i>Preacher!</i>

07:31.369 --> 07:34.664
<i>A cop-killing,
child-murdering son of a bitch</i>

07:34.747 --> 07:36.541
<i>trying to make his way
through the Pearly Gates?</i>

07:36.624 --> 07:39.460
<i>You really think
there's a place for you in Heaven?</i>

07:39.544 --> 07:42.255
<i>Up there with your wife and child?</i>

07:42.338 --> 07:46.300
<i>Living in peace for all eternity?</i>

07:46.384 --> 07:48.678
<i>No.</i>

07:48.761 --> 07:50.847
<i>I'll tell you where you belong.</i>

08:41.480 --> 08:43.733
<i>You've ignored
your soul for too long.</i>

08:45.902 --> 08:49.780
No more killing. No more drinking.

08:51.449 --> 08:53.284
Your soul is where your goodness lies.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.119
The goodness I know is there.

08:57.455 --> 09:00.875
Then we'll be
together in Heaven, for all eternity.

09:19.352 --> 09:21.103
Preacher.

09:21.187 --> 09:25.233
Welcome, my son. Get on your knees.

09:32.698 --> 09:35.326
Do not be deceived.

09:35.409 --> 09:38.412
God is not mocked,

09:38.496 --> 09:41.958
for whatever one sows, that will he also reap.

09:44.001 --> 09:45.753
And let us not grow weary of doing good...

09:45.836 --> 09:46.921
...doing good.

09:47.004 --> 09:51.133
For, in due season,
we will reap, if we do not give up.

09:52.009 --> 09:53.135
Amen.

09:57.348 --> 10:00.059
Mommy, do I have to eat beets?

10:01.018 --> 10:03.187
Yes, my angel. Beets help us grow.

10:03.312 --> 10:06.232
Can't I eat something else to help me grow?

10:06.357 --> 10:08.818
Like what?

10:08.901 --> 10:10.861
Apple pie?

10:12.113 --> 10:13.531
Here. This will help.

10:26.168 --> 10:27.461
How's your milk?

10:27.545 --> 10:28.838
It's good.

10:28.921 --> 10:30.923
Daddy doesn't mean it.

10:31.924 --> 10:34.218
- You callin' me a fibber?
- Uh-huh.

10:34.552 --> 10:36.929
- Here.
- No.

10:37.054 --> 10:41.392
- No one puts salt in their...
- Hold on. Let's see.

10:50.526 --> 10:51.736
Even better.

10:59.785 --> 11:01.245
God damn!

13:04.243 --> 13:05.244
Uh...

13:05.953 --> 13:07.037
Hello in there.

13:08.372 --> 13:09.707
<i>Uh, sorry about the traffic.</i>

13:09.790 --> 13:11.876
<i>I shouldn't have
taken the interstate, but, anyway...</i>

13:12.543 --> 13:14.503
How are you?

13:14.879 --> 13:16.672
My name is F.J. Hoover.

13:16.755 --> 13:18.799
Second Lieutenant of the Grail organization.

13:18.883 --> 13:22.386
I wanna welcome you to our, uh, custody.

13:28.267 --> 13:29.393
We know what you want.

13:30.352 --> 13:34.148
<i>As you know,
Heaven's probably not gonna happen,</i>

13:34.231 --> 13:36.442
<i>but we can give you the next best thing.</i>

13:37.193 --> 13:40.988
All you have to do is work with us.

13:41.071 --> 13:44.408
So, think about it.

14:29.954 --> 14:34.375
<i>Take the horse, keep to your affairs.</i>

14:34.500 --> 14:35.668
Come back to us.

14:37.962 --> 14:40.047
<i>Your soul is where your goodness lies.</i>

14:40.881 --> 14:42.383
Hey, mister! Hey!

14:42.633 --> 14:44.677
We're headed to Ratwater!

14:45.302 --> 14:47.680
<i>Your soul is where
your goodness lies.</i>

14:48.639 --> 14:52.393
<i>The goodness I know is there.</i>

14:55.354 --> 14:56.438
Hey, mister.

14:59.316 --> 15:00.359
No.

15:01.694 --> 15:03.988
<i>No more killing, no more drinking.</i>

15:04.071 --> 15:06.073
<i>No more killing, no more drinking.</i>

15:06.156 --> 15:08.075
<i>No more killing, no more drinking.</i>

15:08.158 --> 15:09.952
<i>No more killing, no more drinking.</i>

15:10.744 --> 15:14.582
<i>Then we'll be
together in Heaven, for all eternity.</i>

15:51.452 --> 15:53.954
<i>You've gotten weaker.</i>

15:54.371 --> 15:56.707
You know you have.

15:58.542 --> 16:00.878
You really should consider our offer.

16:03.005 --> 16:07.051
<i>We just wanna make you strong again.
It is a win-win situation.</i>

16:08.177 --> 16:10.846
<i>After all,</i>

16:10.929 --> 16:14.099
<i>what more do you have to lose?</i>

16:53.972 --> 16:55.391
<i>Okay, good.</i>

16:56.016 --> 16:58.185
<i>I'm glad we could reach this understanding.</i>

16:58.268 --> 17:01.438
<i>Now, just do what you do.</i>

17:38.142 --> 17:40.310
Made up your mind?

17:42.980 --> 17:44.606
Whiskey.

17:54.032 --> 17:55.075
Where you from?

17:56.660 --> 17:57.911
Texas.

17:57.995 --> 17:59.204
Heard of it.

17:59.580 --> 18:01.665
Well, what brings you to New Orleans?

18:08.422 --> 18:10.716
I'm here to kill a man.

18:29.735 --> 18:31.653
What are you
doing in me room, son?

18:40.954 --> 18:41.997
Get out.

19:10.526 --> 19:14.279
It's okay, Banjo. You're safe with me.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.373
You all right?

19:25.082 --> 19:27.960
There's a finger under the stove.

19:29.086 --> 19:30.420
Oh, yeah.

19:31.755 --> 19:33.048
So, when do you think he's coming back?

19:33.131 --> 19:35.509
Will you stop asking me that?

19:35.592 --> 19:37.803
I don't care if Jesse's coming back, okay?

19:37.928 --> 19:40.055
- And neither should you.
- Don't snap at me.

19:40.138 --> 19:42.599
You've not cornered
the market on being pissed off, all right?

19:43.225 --> 19:45.102
I'm just as angry as you are,
you can trust in that.

19:45.227 --> 19:46.603
I mean, who put him in charge?

19:46.687 --> 19:48.772
Well, not me.
I always thought I was in charge.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.858
What?

19:51.400 --> 19:53.068
- Nothin'.
- No, go on.

19:53.151 --> 19:55.279
Oh, please, you're, like, third in charge.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.155
Third? There's no way.

19:57.239 --> 19:58.532
Figure it out, Cass.

19:58.615 --> 20:00.868
- You ain't in charge of me...
- I never said I was.

20:00.951 --> 20:02.619
- ...or Jesse.
- Well, come on.

20:02.703 --> 20:04.204
Third's a bleedin' joke. It's insulting.

20:04.288 --> 20:05.664
Math is what it is.

20:05.747 --> 20:07.374
I'll have you know, I'm in charge

20:07.457 --> 20:09.042
of a whole heap of people, actually.

20:09.126 --> 20:10.961
<i>- Oh, really?
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

20:11.044 --> 20:13.714
<i>- Like who?
- Like, Little Banjo.</i>

20:14.006 --> 20:16.174
- This is worse than waterboarding.
<i>- Not a person.</i>

20:16.300 --> 20:18.260
<i>- Denis.
- Doesn't listen to you.</i>

20:18.343 --> 20:20.721
<i>And we're working on that!</i>

20:20.846 --> 20:22.806
<i>I hardly think that's fair.</i>

20:22.890 --> 20:24.975
Status report.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.685
<i>I'm not third!</i>

20:27.978 --> 20:29.646
He's on his way.

20:29.730 --> 20:31.648
<i>All right. All right. So, let's just say,</i>

20:31.815 --> 20:33.901
for the sake of argument,
that you're left in charge.

20:33.984 --> 20:37.279
What's your bright idea for us, then?
Curious to hear it.

20:43.702 --> 20:44.995
On a serious note, what do we do?

20:45.078 --> 20:47.080
'Cause I'm starting to worry about it.

20:47.164 --> 20:48.415
Well...

20:51.168 --> 20:52.502
We go to Bimini as planned.

20:53.795 --> 20:55.172
What, just the two of us?

20:56.632 --> 20:57.716
Yeah.

20:58.842 --> 20:59.885
Alone?

21:00.969 --> 21:02.304
Sure.

21:07.851 --> 21:11.355
I guess so. Why not?

21:16.735 --> 21:19.029
No reason.

21:22.908 --> 21:27.079
He'll come back. He always comes back.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.708
Not always.

21:34.461 --> 21:35.671
Oh!

21:35.754 --> 21:36.964
Here he is.

21:37.047 --> 21:38.215
Hey, Cass.

21:38.882 --> 21:40.217
- Hey.
- Hi.

21:40.342 --> 21:41.677
We were just wonderin' about you.

21:41.760 --> 21:42.803
You were wondering.

21:42.886 --> 21:44.846
Yeah. You were just starin'
at me finger on the floor.

21:44.930 --> 21:47.933
I wasn't staring at it, Cassidy.
I was noticing it.

21:48.058 --> 21:50.519
Noticing the floor finger
without a wonder in the world.

21:50.727 --> 21:52.020
Well, you find Him?

21:52.104 --> 21:53.647
I don't wanna talk about God right now.

21:55.315 --> 21:56.900
Does anyone here have a drink?

21:58.694 --> 22:00.737
Now, that. That's bloody leadership.

22:00.862 --> 22:02.906
I got a potation in me room, it's just ripe.

22:03.031 --> 22:04.783
I think you're gonna love it. Come on.

22:05.409 --> 22:06.451
A what?

22:08.578 --> 22:11.415
Hey, save some for me, you wet brains!

22:14.459 --> 22:15.877
"Potation."

23:23.153 --> 23:24.446
Preacher.

23:26.198 --> 23:27.282
No.

23:34.748 --> 23:35.999
Weapons.

23:38.543 --> 23:39.669
Rio.

23:54.309 --> 23:56.186
You leave 'em alone!

24:06.655 --> 24:10.283
That's a pretty
farfetched theory, Cass, even for you.

24:10.367 --> 24:13.537
I'm telling you, mate,
if you watch that movie again, you'll see.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.205
Tyler Durden does exist.

24:16.706 --> 24:18.875
You're telling
me the twist of Fight Club is

24:19.084 --> 24:20.335
there is no twist?

24:20.418 --> 24:22.295
- Exactly!
- How do you figure that?

24:22.379 --> 24:25.549
Well, because nobody
listens to ugly people, Padre, right?

24:25.632 --> 24:28.718
You know, if you're gonna
inspire an anti-materialistic organization

24:28.802 --> 24:31.847
with worldwide designs
on erasing global debt,

24:31.930 --> 24:33.557
you gotta look like Brad Pitt.

24:33.890 --> 24:35.142
I'll give you that.

24:35.225 --> 24:38.019
I wouldn't exactly call Edward Norton ugly.

25:08.341 --> 25:11.011
The Netherlands are the leading
consumers in the foreskin market.

25:11.094 --> 25:12.387
I'll give you 10 to one.

25:12.470 --> 25:14.931
They buy so much at a time,
half goes to waste.

25:15.015 --> 25:17.058
So they've started sneaking
the excess into toothpaste

25:17.142 --> 25:18.685
and baby formula.

25:18.894 --> 25:22.731
<i>Like how Brad Pitt, how
he sells the fat lady soap to rich ladies.</i>

25:26.234 --> 25:29.362
No, I mean Brad Pitt,
because he does exist.

25:29.446 --> 25:30.822
Look, the point is,

25:30.906 --> 25:33.450
what I'm trying to say is
that the Netherlands are like this...

25:33.533 --> 25:34.701
Okay?

25:34.784 --> 25:36.203
Someone's gotta stop 'em.

25:36.286 --> 25:38.288
Come on, Cass. That can't be true.

25:38.371 --> 25:42.375
Widespread reports.
Substantiated reports about it.

25:42.459 --> 25:44.794
Well, if it makes it taste better,
then what's the harm in it?

25:44.920 --> 25:46.379
It's foreskin into baby formula.

25:46.463 --> 25:48.965
It's bloody cannibalism, are you jokin'?

26:07.234 --> 26:09.236
Try some of this.

26:09.319 --> 26:11.321
It's me reserve stock, that's what I call it.

26:11.446 --> 26:14.157
Have a go of that.
I think you'll find that... Oh, shite!

26:14.991 --> 26:16.409
Bollocks.

26:16.493 --> 26:17.619
What is it? Battery acid?

26:17.702 --> 26:18.828
Just try it.

26:23.333 --> 26:25.460
What? Too much Neosporin?

26:25.794 --> 26:27.254
- Can we get a beer now?
- Yeah, all right.

26:27.337 --> 26:30.298
Tulip, get your man a six pack!

26:38.098 --> 26:41.142
That's odd. She normally hops right to that.

26:41.518 --> 26:42.644
I'll go gather some suds.

27:19.556 --> 27:21.141
Where's Tulip?

27:21.224 --> 27:22.726
Not here for her.

27:26.021 --> 27:28.690
So, shall I ask you to beg,

27:28.773 --> 27:30.066
or should I make you?

27:32.694 --> 27:36.489
I was merciful last time,
not sending you back to where you belong.

27:36.573 --> 27:40.118
No, you were chicken shit.

27:40.243 --> 27:42.787
Didn't want your soul in Hell.

27:47.375 --> 27:48.752
Get on your knees.

27:50.754 --> 27:52.422
Didn't hear you, Preacher.

27:54.924 --> 27:56.593
- Get...
- Come here, you shite!

28:46.267 --> 28:47.602
He's gonna kill him.

28:47.685 --> 28:51.189
Not yet. He's taking his time.

28:54.359 --> 28:57.028
Get away from him, you asshole!

28:59.239 --> 29:00.407
Stop.

29:21.970 --> 29:23.471
Hey!

29:24.431 --> 29:26.474
You're not here for her.

29:29.936 --> 29:31.855
That's right, Preacher.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.233
I'm here for you.

29:39.988 --> 29:42.657
Time to get on your knees.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.671
I met a man once.

29:56.754 --> 30:00.258
A bar, a town where I had some business.

30:02.594 --> 30:07.348
He sat down and talked at me
about scalpin' heads.

30:10.393 --> 30:13.897
Comanche, mostly.
Out there on the Colorado.

30:16.733 --> 30:18.067
They were his business.

30:21.154 --> 30:24.240
The noise their heads would make.

30:25.950 --> 30:28.870
That's what he talked most about.

30:28.995 --> 30:33.166
The noise was his main concern.

30:35.752 --> 30:39.422
He tried describing it to me.

30:39.506 --> 30:42.050
"Like a wet sheet torn to pieces."

30:45.053 --> 30:47.931
Only not.

30:48.014 --> 30:49.682
Only different.

30:50.517 --> 30:53.770
He'd been at this business for so long,

30:53.853 --> 30:56.189
the man allowed that he'd fallen into

30:56.272 --> 30:58.483
a captivation over it over the years.

31:00.401 --> 31:05.323
Sittin' in church,
or laying in his bed at night,

31:07.116 --> 31:10.703
he couldn't stop turnin' it over in his mind.

31:12.497 --> 31:16.042
The noise was all he loved.

31:19.170 --> 31:22.131
I shot him dead with all the rest.

31:26.511 --> 31:30.682
But I've been curious
about his noise ever since.

31:32.475 --> 31:35.103
So, go ahead.

31:36.145 --> 31:38.439
But then you're never gonna see Heaven.

31:38.523 --> 31:41.025
Like you said, things I done,

31:42.110 --> 31:44.821
I was never gonna, anyway.

31:45.947 --> 31:48.658
There ain't no such thing as never.

31:50.660 --> 31:52.495
Any man can change himself.

31:54.998 --> 31:56.874
I tried to.

31:59.961 --> 32:02.130
But it's a lie.

32:15.351 --> 32:18.855
William, that's enough.

32:20.023 --> 32:22.233
Time to go back.

32:23.526 --> 32:24.777
Never.

32:24.861 --> 32:25.945
It's up to you.

32:26.029 --> 32:29.157
But your hell is empty
and must be filled with someone.

32:32.327 --> 32:34.537
Like your wife, or your daughter.

32:35.496 --> 32:37.290
You can't do that.

32:38.791 --> 32:41.836
God's gone. Who's going to stop me?

32:59.228 --> 33:01.481
And what about the Preacher?

33:01.981 --> 33:04.859
Leave him. Those are my orders.

33:11.574 --> 33:12.575
Another time.

33:34.722 --> 33:37.975
You're lucky to have
a man like <i>Herr</i> Starr looking out for you.

33:42.105 --> 33:45.608
He has my soul.

33:45.692 --> 33:47.151
Sorry to hear it.

33:49.195 --> 33:50.446
Padre?

33:50.530 --> 33:52.699
Little help here, please?

34:01.833 --> 34:03.251
- I'll meet you there.
- No, no. Listen, listen.

34:03.334 --> 34:05.920
Someone needs to stay with
Denis, warm him up some medicine.

34:06.003 --> 34:08.715
Oh, and keep an eye on
Little Banjo, will you?

34:09.006 --> 34:10.466
Why you going to the hospital, anyway?

34:10.675 --> 34:12.218
Blood run. I'm running low.

34:13.428 --> 34:14.804
Right.

34:20.226 --> 34:22.645
I'm sorry.

34:22.729 --> 34:24.397
I thought I could stop him. I really did.

34:25.064 --> 34:29.026
But that son of a bitch
punched me in the throat and I...

34:29.110 --> 34:31.279
Good thing I was there.

34:31.362 --> 34:33.072
Sounds like you really saved the day.

34:33.740 --> 34:35.074
Shut up, Cass.

34:39.036 --> 34:42.039
Look, whatever, okay?

34:43.708 --> 34:45.501
It all worked out in the end.

35:01.392 --> 35:03.186
Thank you both for coming.

35:03.269 --> 35:04.937
I'll dive right in, while you take a moment

35:05.021 --> 35:07.190
to adjust and acclimate yourselves.

35:07.523 --> 35:08.733
My name is <i>Herr</i> Starr.

35:08.858 --> 35:11.194
My God, you're unattractive.

35:12.195 --> 35:13.613
I'm sorry, I just...

35:14.238 --> 35:16.783
I saw his face and I just had the thought.

35:16.866 --> 35:18.201
Said it out loud.

35:19.118 --> 35:22.205
Jesse has mentioned me to you?
Told you about our dealings?

35:24.248 --> 35:26.000
Your "dealings"?

35:26.083 --> 35:28.211
He hasn't taken you
into his confidence?

35:29.170 --> 35:31.547
Suppose I'm not surprised.
You are holding him back.

35:31.881 --> 35:33.049
You see...

35:33.132 --> 35:37.386
And how do I find a way of saying
this without hurting your feelings?

35:37.470 --> 35:39.305
My God, it's hypnotic, isn't it?

35:39.388 --> 35:41.474
Like a school bus crash. It's...

35:41.557 --> 35:42.767
I can't take my eyes off your face...

35:42.850 --> 35:43.976
Cassidy, shut up.

35:44.060 --> 35:45.228
Well, he's doing all the talking.

35:45.311 --> 35:46.437
Why don't we make him shut up?

35:46.562 --> 35:49.774
I wanna hear what he has to say, okay?

35:49.941 --> 35:53.945
That's right, Tulip, you understand.

35:54.070 --> 35:56.072
Jesse Custer is heading for big things.

35:56.155 --> 36:00.493
Greatness. Glory. Power.
He's a very special person.

36:00.576 --> 36:03.079
And deep down,
whether he's ready to admit it or not,

36:03.162 --> 36:06.624
he knows the two of you just aren't.

36:06.749 --> 36:10.336
So, my question,
what this has been about from the beginning,

36:10.419 --> 36:13.798
that I think we
should really dig into and discuss here,

36:13.923 --> 36:17.468
given that the fate
of the entire universe is at stake is,

36:19.679 --> 36:22.265
"How shall we proceed?"

36:38.781 --> 36:41.200
<i>God is gone...</i>

36:44.203 --> 36:45.788
<i>From our hearts.</i>

36:47.790 --> 36:51.294
<i>From town to town
and cities across the world,</i>

36:53.462 --> 36:54.797
<i>His absence is real.</i>

36:55.172 --> 36:57.425
<i>The loss of Him widely felt,</i>

36:57.508 --> 37:01.470
<i>leaving us poor sinners alone</i>

37:01.554 --> 37:05.141
<i>to grapple with the age-old, eternal question,</i>

37:05.641 --> 37:07.393
<i>"What happens next?"</i>

37:10.479 --> 37:14.734
<i>I answer that question with hope.</i>

37:14.817 --> 37:18.905
<i>God is gone, but His promise remains.</i>

37:18.988 --> 37:23.701
<i>The promise that, when all seems most lost,</i>

37:24.660 --> 37:28.164
<i>His Son will return to save us.</i>

37:32.084 --> 37:38.007
<i>Jesus, or a reasonable
approximation thereof, is coming.</i>

37:38.841 --> 37:42.386
<i>You need not doubt or fear much longer.</i>

37:42.511 --> 37:46.849
<i>All you need to do is get ready.</i>

37:52.730 --> 37:53.856
Hey.

37:58.027 --> 37:59.362
I gave Denis some blood.

38:00.196 --> 38:02.406
His head's... It's at a funny angle,

38:04.867 --> 38:06.035
but he's sleeping.

38:06.619 --> 38:09.080
Thanks.

38:09.538 --> 38:10.706
What happened?

38:11.916 --> 38:13.459
What happened with you?

38:18.547 --> 38:20.758
Let's get something to eat.

38:30.393 --> 38:31.852
Now, look, I'm telling you. I seen it.

38:31.936 --> 38:33.354
I seen it with me own two eyes.

38:33.437 --> 38:35.439
Cass, the amount of
crap you've put in your body...

38:35.731 --> 38:37.108
I'm sure you've seen all kinds of things.

38:37.233 --> 38:38.317
Well, I will have you know

38:38.401 --> 38:41.320
that I was damn near
completely sober at the time, right?

38:41.404 --> 38:42.446
Listen to this.

38:42.571 --> 38:44.240
I was lying by the campfire there,

38:44.323 --> 38:47.743
I hear a bit of a noise,
so I went down to the river to investigate,

38:48.452 --> 38:50.329
and there it was, just...

38:54.083 --> 38:55.251
You know...

38:57.461 --> 38:59.171
Licking an ice cream cone, huh?

38:59.255 --> 39:00.339
"Licking an ice cream"?

39:00.423 --> 39:01.507
How'd you get that from what I just did?

39:01.590 --> 39:02.675
'Cause that's what it looked like.

39:02.758 --> 39:04.885
Like it were eating an ice cream cone.

39:04.969 --> 39:06.971
Where the bloody hell
is it gonna get an ice cream cone?

39:07.096 --> 39:08.097
The ice cream truck?

39:08.180 --> 39:11.475
You're just
trying to ruin my story and I don't like it.

39:11.600 --> 39:14.437
It was drinking river water.

39:14.520 --> 39:15.521
The unicorn?

39:15.604 --> 39:17.356
Honestly. Stood under the stars.

39:17.440 --> 39:19.191
It was just, beautiful scene. Regal.

39:19.275 --> 39:20.276
Majestic creature.

39:20.359 --> 39:21.569
- He was thirsty?
- Well, yeah.

39:21.652 --> 39:23.946
It's clip-clopping
around with an enormous horn on its head.

39:24.030 --> 39:26.449
You know? I can only imagine
the dehydration with that.

39:26.532 --> 39:28.492
And eating all that ice cream
could not have helped.

39:28.617 --> 39:29.952
There wasn't any ice cream!

39:30.036 --> 39:31.412
That's right. Ice cream makes you thirsty.

39:31.495 --> 39:32.538
- Known fact.
- Now, stop it.

39:32.621 --> 39:34.206
We're out in the middle of the forest.

39:34.290 --> 39:36.792
Where in the heck
is it gonna find an ice cream truck?

39:36.876 --> 39:38.669
- Just sayin'...
- Stop it.

39:38.794 --> 39:39.795
Bloody moron.

39:46.802 --> 39:48.429
So, are you gonna say it, or should we?

39:49.472 --> 39:51.640
- What?
- We met your friend.

39:51.974 --> 39:54.727
The one with the head like an old egg.

39:55.394 --> 39:56.520
When?

39:56.604 --> 39:57.688
"The Messiah"?

39:59.648 --> 40:01.275
Come on. That's a joke, right?

40:04.820 --> 40:06.113
Padre. Tell me you're jokin'.

40:07.198 --> 40:08.741
I don't think I have a choice.

40:08.824 --> 40:10.284
What are you talking about?

40:10.367 --> 40:12.119
Course, you have...
You've got lots of choices.

40:12.203 --> 40:13.370
What about finding God?

40:13.788 --> 40:15.206
I found Him already.

40:15.289 --> 40:16.665
What?

40:18.167 --> 40:19.293
Well, sort of.

40:23.047 --> 40:24.840
Do you remember Man-Dog?

40:28.219 --> 40:29.470
No!

40:31.138 --> 40:33.140
I knew there was something about that dog.

40:33.224 --> 40:37.478
Well, I got to thinking,
is it worth finding a God like this?

40:37.561 --> 40:40.940
And honestly, I don't know.

40:42.525 --> 40:44.026
What I do know is, someone worse

40:44.110 --> 40:45.569
is getting set to take his place.

40:45.653 --> 40:47.029
All right. Let him take His place.

40:47.113 --> 40:49.281
They've been
rotating kinky gods on and off the throne

40:49.365 --> 40:50.991
since the beginning of time.

40:51.075 --> 40:52.576
You know? We've always been all right.

40:52.660 --> 40:53.702
Not this time.

40:53.786 --> 40:57.957
Humperdoo being
the savior of the world? No.

41:00.084 --> 41:01.252
I have to do this.

41:02.086 --> 41:03.587
See? Told you.

41:03.671 --> 41:05.923
No, I don't see, I don't see this at all.

41:06.006 --> 41:08.592
Look, you, the Messiah?

41:09.176 --> 41:10.761
No offense, Padre, but that has gotta be

41:10.845 --> 41:12.346
the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

41:12.680 --> 41:14.682
- Why not me?
- Have you met yourself?

41:14.765 --> 41:16.892
Padre, you drink, you fight.

41:16.976 --> 41:18.352
You like to break people's arms

41:18.435 --> 41:19.812
just to hear the sounds they make.

41:19.895 --> 41:22.231
You're just a person like the rest of us, Jess.

41:22.314 --> 41:23.691
No, I'm not, Cass.

41:24.233 --> 41:27.862
See, I was given this power.
Me. Not anyone else.

41:27.945 --> 41:28.988
Me.

41:30.865 --> 41:32.408
You know, a long time ago,
I made this promise...

41:32.491 --> 41:34.493
"A long time ago, I made this promise

41:34.577 --> 41:36.537
"to me dad to be good." We remember.

41:36.620 --> 41:40.499
You made a promise.
You did. What about us?

41:41.292 --> 41:42.459
Well, you can come with me.

41:43.794 --> 41:46.046
Hard part's over, the Saint's gone.

41:46.130 --> 41:48.382
We can go back
to saving the world and having fun.

41:48.465 --> 41:49.842
God, do you remember that time,

41:49.925 --> 41:52.011
and honestly, it feels like ages ago now...

41:52.136 --> 41:55.431
We were talking about
bikinis and hand guns.

41:55.514 --> 41:56.974
Just getting into trouble. Right?

41:57.057 --> 42:01.353
To me that's fun. That's fun.
Not bowing down to Lord Jesse.

42:01.478 --> 42:03.230
Come on, Cass. It's not gonna be like that.

42:03.314 --> 42:05.065
No? Well, what's it gonna be like, then?

42:05.149 --> 42:06.650
'Cause I'm super curious to hear about it.

42:10.029 --> 42:11.071
I don't know.

42:17.286 --> 42:18.287
Guys.

42:20.873 --> 42:21.916
Come on.

42:26.587 --> 42:30.925
I love you, Jesse. Till the end of the world.

42:34.011 --> 42:37.765
But you gotta be honest with me.

42:37.848 --> 42:39.516
What do you need us for?

42:40.517 --> 42:41.518
What...

43:08.671 --> 43:11.966
Tell Satan I want a word.

43:12.049 --> 43:14.510
He'll want a word with you as well.

43:34.530 --> 43:38.367
- Any word?
- Not yet.

43:38.492 --> 43:39.702
Find them!

43:41.578 --> 43:43.455
This way. Come on.

43:50.337 --> 43:52.006
Baby, put the gun down, okay?

43:52.089 --> 43:55.342
She didn't mean
anything to me, all right? I love you.

43:55.426 --> 43:57.303
You can't talk your
way out of this one.

43:57.386 --> 43:58.554
- Not this time.
- Baby.

43:58.637 --> 44:00.597
You gotta believe me, baby. It was just sex.

44:00.681 --> 44:03.183
Just a lot of really great sex.

44:03.267 --> 44:04.601
You son of a bitch!

44:16.739 --> 44:17.990
Oh, my God.

44:18.073 --> 44:19.283
Babies?

44:19.408 --> 44:21.577
Never mind. Keep moving!

44:25.122 --> 44:28.584
Two days. Three at most.

44:28.667 --> 44:32.588
Take the horse, keep to your affairs.

44:32.671 --> 44:34.840
Come back to us.

45:00.949 --> 45:03.243
Where are your friends?

45:03.327 --> 45:05.579
They couldn't make it.

45:05.662 --> 45:07.206
That's too bad.

45:07.289 --> 45:10.793
But I knew you'd make the right decision.

45:12.920 --> 45:14.630
What happens next?
