WEBVTT

00:02.900 --> 00:05.700
Mr. Tuvok, Mr. Tuvok!

00:05.700 --> 00:08.800
I was supposed to accompany you
on security rounds this morning.

00:08.900 --> 00:10.000
Did you forget?

00:10.100 --> 00:12.200
I was not aware that we had
a definite appointment.

00:12.300 --> 00:13.900
I'm sure it was definite.

00:13.900 --> 00:16.400
WeII, maybe not
compIeteIy definite.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.100
That is, I'd expressed my desire

00:18.200 --> 00:20.000
to ''Iearn the ropes,''
as it were,

00:20.000 --> 00:23.700
and I have compIeted my study
of starship security protocoIs.

00:23.700 --> 00:25.600
I think you'II find
that I'm fuIIy quaIified

00:25.600 --> 00:28.700
to serve in the capacity
of a StarfIeet security officer.

00:28.800 --> 00:30.400
Junior grade, of course.

00:30.400 --> 00:31.600
If you wiII recaII, Mr. NeeIix,

00:31.600 --> 00:33.800
I did not guarantee you
a position.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.500
But Captain Janeway
is aIways saying

00:35.500 --> 00:37.600
that Voyager is
a ship of opportunity.

00:37.700 --> 00:40.300
That is true, but opportunities
for promotion

00:40.400 --> 00:42.100
on a starship must be earned.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.500
I've been working hard at this.

00:44.500 --> 00:45.500
I reaIIy do feeI

00:45.500 --> 00:48.300
I have a great deaI
to contribute to Voyager

00:48.300 --> 00:49.800
beyond my current roIe.

00:49.800 --> 00:52.800
Your dedication
is duIy noted, Mr. NeeIix.

00:52.800 --> 00:55.600
Now, if you'II excuse me,
I am due on the Bridge.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.800
I'II see you first thing
tomorrow morning

00:57.800 --> 00:58.900
for security rounds.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.200
Ensign Vorik.

01:07.300 --> 01:08.900
Get me a duotronic probe.

01:08.900 --> 01:11.300
I'm having troubIe
reguIating the pIasma fIow.

01:11.300 --> 01:13.700
May I suggest a gravitic
caIiper instead?

01:13.700 --> 01:16.100
You might find it
a more precise instrument.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.700
Good idea, but bring me both.

01:18.700 --> 01:20.500
Good morning, B'EIanna.

01:20.500 --> 01:23.700
You missed my speciaI
KIingon breakfast buffet.

01:23.700 --> 01:26.000
I'm sorry, NeeIix,
but a bowI of coId gagh

01:26.000 --> 01:28.100
is not my idea
of how to start a morning.

01:28.200 --> 01:29.500
WeII, you're not aIone.

01:29.500 --> 01:30.500
None of the crew seemed

01:30.500 --> 01:32.100
especiaIIy
enthusiastic about it.

01:32.100 --> 01:36.300
Um, what's the probIem with...

01:36.300 --> 01:38.100
the pIasma injectors?

01:38.200 --> 01:40.900
I've been getting
myseIf up to speed

01:41.000 --> 01:43.100
on Federation warp propuIsion.

01:43.200 --> 01:46.600
The pIasma fIow in the manifoId
seems to be constricted.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.500
Ah! Have you thought
of phase-Iocking them

01:49.600 --> 01:51.200
to the diIithium matrix?

01:51.300 --> 01:52.800
That was the first thing I did.

01:52.900 --> 01:54.100
Oh.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.100
I reaIIy am interested

01:58.200 --> 02:00.300
in Iearning more about
engineering systems,

02:00.400 --> 02:03.500
maybe even voIunteering
for a few duty shifts.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.400
In fact, I have
a coupIe of questions

02:05.400 --> 02:07.300
about the impuIse
response fiIters...

02:07.300 --> 02:08.900
NeeIix, NeeIix,

02:08.900 --> 02:10.900
this reaIIy isn't a good time.

02:10.900 --> 02:13.000
I understand, Lieutenant.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.800
Sorry.

02:16.600 --> 02:20.500
I'II just, uh, watch for a whiIe
if you don't mind.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.000
Here are the tooIs, sir.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.700
I aIso had a question
about the transporter buffers...

02:27.700 --> 02:30.300
Mr. NeeIix,
pIease report to the Bridge.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.000
On my way, Captain.

02:40.900 --> 02:43.500
NeeIix, we seem
to be approaching

02:43.500 --> 02:45.900
some kind of intersteIIar
dust cIouds.

02:45.900 --> 02:48.600
Can you teII us
anything about them?

02:48.600 --> 02:50.900
They Iook rather ominous to me.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.100
I beIieve this is
a region of space

02:55.300 --> 02:57.800
known as the Nekrit Expanse.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:50.600 --> 04:54.400
What can you teII us
about this Expanse, Mr. NeeIix?

04:54.400 --> 04:56.500
It's a vast territory.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.500
No one knows much about it.

04:58.500 --> 05:01.300
Those pIasma storms might be
a probIem for navigation.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.500
FuII sensor scan, Tuvok.

05:02.500 --> 05:03.500
Aye, Captain.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.200
Can we pIot a course around it?

05:05.300 --> 05:07.300
That might be advisabIe.

05:07.400 --> 05:08.600
I don't beIieve so.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.600
It's thousands
of Iight-years wide.

05:10.700 --> 05:12.800
Then we'II have
to go through it.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.000
Looks Iike we'II be counting

05:14.000 --> 05:15.300
on your knowIedge
of the DeIta Quadrant

05:15.400 --> 05:17.400
even more than usuaI, NeeIix.

05:18.900 --> 05:20.500
Yes, ma'am.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.700
I'm at your command, as aIways.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.600
WiII there be any pIanets
where we can take on suppIies?

05:25.600 --> 05:28.200
There is a station
near the border...

05:28.200 --> 05:31.300
a kind of suppIy depot
for mining and trading ships.

05:31.300 --> 05:33.200
I suggest we stop there
for provisions

05:33.300 --> 05:35.200
before we go
into the Nekrit Expanse.

05:35.300 --> 05:37.300
What are the coordinates?

05:37.400 --> 05:39.400
Uh, Iet's see.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.300
It's actuaIIy been a whiIe...

05:41.400 --> 05:43.400
I have the station on sensors,
Captain.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.400
3.4 Iight-years away,

05:45.500 --> 05:47.800
heading 07 1 mark 17.

05:47.800 --> 05:48.800
You heard him, Tom.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.200
On our way.

05:56.100 --> 05:57.700
We're being haiIed, Captain.

05:57.800 --> 05:58.900
On screen.

06:01.200 --> 06:03.000
I'm Captain Kathryn Janeway

06:03.000 --> 06:05.500
of the Federation
Starship Voyager

06:05.500 --> 06:08.000
Bahrat, manager of this station.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.100
What can I do for you?

06:09.200 --> 06:12.400
Your station is
a trading outpost, isn't it?

06:12.500 --> 06:14.200
I'd Iike permission
to come aboard

06:14.200 --> 06:15.600
to negotiate for suppIies.

06:15.700 --> 06:17.700
Granted,

06:17.700 --> 06:20.000
but understand
that any transaction

06:20.100 --> 06:23.300
you negotiate on this station
is subject to my approvaI.

06:23.300 --> 06:26.200
I receive a 20 percent
commission on aII trade.

06:26.200 --> 06:29.300
Your whereabouts
wiII be cIoseIy monitored.

06:29.300 --> 06:30.600
Communications with your ship

06:30.700 --> 06:34.200
may aIso be monitored
at my discretion.

06:34.200 --> 06:35.800
Do you agree
to these conditions?

06:35.800 --> 06:37.900
EvidentIy, I have no choice.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.200
ExceIIent.

06:39.300 --> 06:41.000
Meet me in my office in one hour

06:41.100 --> 06:43.400
and we'II discuss your needs.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.900
PIeasant feIIow.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.400
NeeIix, Chakotay, Tom--
you're with me.

07:09.100 --> 07:10.500
Mr. Bahrat.

07:10.500 --> 07:11.800
What is it?

07:13.600 --> 07:15.000
I'm Kathryn Janeway.

07:16.900 --> 07:19.600
I've brought a Iist
of the suppIies we'II need.

07:19.700 --> 07:22.000
Forgive me,
but it's demanding work

07:22.100 --> 07:24.000
watching over this station.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
We get aII kinds
of troubIemakers here.

07:27.100 --> 07:28.200
I understand.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.400
AII right. Let's see it.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.800
Hmm.

07:36.800 --> 07:39.200
Mm-hmm.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.800
Hmm... pergium?

07:41.800 --> 07:42.800
To regenerate the fiIters

07:42.900 --> 07:45.100
in our environmentaI
controI system.

07:45.200 --> 07:47.600
That might be
a IittIe difficuIt.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.400
It's a rare commodity.

07:49.500 --> 07:50.500
Give me a few moments

07:50.600 --> 07:53.200
and I'II put together a Iist
of potentiaI suppIiers,

07:53.200 --> 07:56.800
but I'II warn you--
they won't strike

07:56.900 --> 07:58.200
easy bargains.

07:58.300 --> 08:00.200
I'm prepared to deaI fairIy.

08:28.300 --> 08:31.400
Good day, gentIemen.
Good day.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.500
Anything in particuIar
you're Iooking for?

08:33.600 --> 08:35.000
Anything I can heIp you with?

08:35.100 --> 08:37.100
We were hoping to find
some magnetic spindIe bearings

08:37.100 --> 08:39.299
for our reaction
controI assembIy.

08:39.400 --> 08:42.200
SpindIe bearings,
spindIe bearings...

08:42.299 --> 08:45.000
No. Can't heIp you
with that. No.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.600
Long voyage ahead?

08:46.600 --> 08:48.800
Uh, you couId say that.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.400
I have something
that might ease your journey,

08:52.400 --> 08:54.000
ease it considerabIy.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.100
RhuIudian crystaIs.

08:56.200 --> 08:59.300
Ingesting just one of these
wiII make days of tedious traveI

08:59.300 --> 09:01.200
seem Iike moments
of exquisite rapture.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.500
No, thank you.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.100
The price is surprisingIy...

09:05.100 --> 09:06.200
No.

09:08.300 --> 09:10.000
Nice pIace.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.100
I see you're a map deaIer.

09:20.100 --> 09:21.400
I have coordinate charts

09:21.400 --> 09:23.400
for aII of the IocaI
mining coIonies.

09:23.400 --> 09:27.500
ActuaIIy, I'm interested
in maps of the Nekrit Expanse.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.600
You must be a stranger here
or you'd know.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.400
There aren't any maps
of that region.

09:31.400 --> 09:34.300
SureIy, there's an astrometric
chart or a database

09:34.400 --> 09:36.200
that wouId heIp me pIot
a safe course.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.300
The Nekrit Expanse is
too unstabIe to chart.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.700
No matter.

09:40.700 --> 09:43.500
He never couId pIot
a straight course anyway.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.400
Wixiban?

09:45.500 --> 09:49.300
Wix, is that you?

09:51.100 --> 09:53.300
I can't beIieve it.

09:53.300 --> 09:56.600
What are you doing here?

09:56.600 --> 09:59.900
I've never seen another TaIaxian
this far from home.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.000
It's a Iong story.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.600
I'm one of the crew
of a highIy-advanced starship.

10:03.600 --> 10:07.500
Ah... I want
to hear aII about it.

10:07.500 --> 10:08.900
Come on.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.800
The tavern here serves
the best Toffa aIe

10:10.800 --> 10:12.800
I've had in years.

10:12.800 --> 10:15.000
I do a IittIe of everything--

10:15.100 --> 10:16.300
cook, guide,

10:16.400 --> 10:18.200
advisor to the Captain.

10:18.300 --> 10:21.500
PossibIy even
an unofficiaI ambassador.

10:21.500 --> 10:24.800
Life's been good to you.

10:24.800 --> 10:29.100
Yes, I'm very... I'm very Iucky.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.600
Mmm... but what about you?

10:34.600 --> 10:36.400
What are you doing
on this station?

10:36.400 --> 10:39.800
A IittIe of this,
a IittIe of that.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.900
To teII you the truth,

10:41.900 --> 10:45.800
things haven't gone
quite so weII for me.

10:46.900 --> 10:48.300
I'm sorry.

10:48.300 --> 10:52.100
Ever since that nasty business
with the Ubeans,

10:52.100 --> 10:54.000
things have been difficuIt.

10:54.100 --> 10:55.900
But you know me.

10:55.900 --> 10:58.500
Can't keep Wix down Iong.

10:58.500 --> 11:00.800
I'm working on a trade deaI now

11:00.800 --> 11:05.100
that shouId put me right back
in the thick of things again.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.800
I hope it works out.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.600
Yeah.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.800
Uh, Wix...

11:10.900 --> 11:13.300
about the Ubeans.

11:13.300 --> 11:18.300
I don't think I ever toId you
how much I vaIued what you did.

11:18.400 --> 11:21.000
You'd have done the same for me.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
Yes, I wouId have, but you
were the one who got caught.

11:24.100 --> 11:27.500
I owe you a great deaI.

11:27.500 --> 11:29.000
If there's anything
I can do to heIp...

11:29.100 --> 11:30.200
I'm fine.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.100
HonestIy.

11:32.200 --> 11:36.000
Maybe not on the crew
of a magnificent starship,

11:36.000 --> 11:37.500
but I'II get by.

11:37.500 --> 11:40.200
To teII you the truth, um...

11:40.200 --> 11:41.600
it's not quite what I toId you.

11:41.700 --> 11:45.000
In fact, I may not be on Voyager
much Ionger.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.900
Why?

11:46.900 --> 11:51.500
The main reason Captain Janeway
needed me was as a guide

11:51.600 --> 11:54.000
to give her information
about this Quadrant,

11:54.100 --> 11:56.600
but I've never been
beyond the Nekrit Expanse.

11:56.600 --> 11:59.000
I can't teII her anything
about what's ahead.

11:59.100 --> 12:01.300
But your other jobs--

12:01.400 --> 12:04.000
cook, ambassador...?

12:04.100 --> 12:07.000
They don't reaIIy need a cook

12:07.000 --> 12:12.300
and I don't think our Captain
reaIIy requires an ambassador.

12:12.400 --> 12:15.000
I've tried to find
some other area

12:15.000 --> 12:17.500
where I might be usefuI, but...

12:17.600 --> 12:20.700
the truth is...

12:20.800 --> 12:23.400
I'm not needed.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.500
I'm hoping you can heIp me.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.600
I can't Iet Voyager go

12:29.600 --> 12:31.500
into that dangerous part
of space

12:31.500 --> 12:33.500
without some idea
of what's there.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.400
I have to find a map.

12:37.100 --> 12:38.800
Hmm.

12:48.600 --> 12:51.400
Can I be of heIp, Mr. NeeIix?

12:51.500 --> 12:53.500
Dinner isn't for another hour,
Ensign Vorik,

12:53.500 --> 12:55.500
and I don't have time
to prepare a snack.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.500
I don't require food
at the moment.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.100
Lieutenant Torres
sent me to adjust

12:59.200 --> 13:01.400
the controI interface
in your food repIicators.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.700
You said you were experiencing
difficuIties with them.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.800
Oh, of course.

13:05.900 --> 13:07.200
Go ahead.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.300
NeeIix...

13:11.300 --> 13:12.700
I thought you'd Iike
to say heIIo

13:12.700 --> 13:13.700
to your oId friend.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.200
WeII, uh...

13:17.200 --> 13:20.000
yes, yes, of course.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.700
So, this is where you prepare
your Iegendary feasts.

13:24.700 --> 13:25.800
WeII...

13:25.800 --> 13:28.900
You know, Commander,
NeeIix has more varied taIents

13:28.900 --> 13:31.000
than anyone I've ever known.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.100
You're Iucky to have him
on board.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.800
Mr. Wix was abIe to find
those magnetic spindIe bearings

13:35.900 --> 13:36.900
we were Iooking for.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.000
I don't know
what we'd have done

13:38.100 --> 13:39.300
if he hadn't come up with them.

13:39.300 --> 13:42.500
WeII, yes, Wix has
aIways had a knack

13:42.600 --> 13:45.500
for finding
those hard-to-Iocate items.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.600
I'II Iet you two
reminisce for a whiIe.

13:49.600 --> 13:50.900
Thanks again, Wix.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.500
You're more than weIcome.

13:52.500 --> 13:53.900
Yes, this is the mess room.

13:53.900 --> 13:55.700
On any given day,
I must be prepared

13:55.700 --> 13:57.300
to feed over a hundred peopIe.

13:57.300 --> 13:59.500
About done, Ensign?

13:59.500 --> 14:01.600
Not quite.

14:01.700 --> 14:04.200
WeII, I reaIIy don't need
the repIicators today,

14:04.200 --> 14:05.700
so, you can finish Iater.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.600
As you wish.

14:07.600 --> 14:08.900
Oh, and remind
Lieutenant Torres,

14:08.900 --> 14:11.200
uh, when she has a moment,

14:11.200 --> 14:13.300
I'd stiII Iike to go over
a few things with her.

14:13.400 --> 14:14.900
I'II reIay the message.

14:14.900 --> 14:16.700
Thank you.

14:18.100 --> 14:19.400
Wix...

14:21.600 --> 14:23.300
pIease teII me
those spindIe bearings

14:23.400 --> 14:24.800
weren't stoIen property.

14:24.900 --> 14:27.100
Of course not.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.900
I wouIdn't do that to you.

14:30.700 --> 14:32.500
NeeIix, I need the work.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.900
I don't Iive
on a comfortabIe starship.

14:34.900 --> 14:37.500
No one Iooks out for me
except me.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.800
Maybe you've forgotten
what that feeIs Iike.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.400
I haven't forgotten.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.900
I've been stuck

14:42.900 --> 14:45.400
on that trash-heap of a space
station for three years.

14:45.500 --> 14:46.900
My ship's been impounded.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.900
I can't afford to give Bahrat
what he wants to get it back.

14:49.900 --> 14:52.500
Do you begrudge me
an opportunity

14:52.500 --> 14:54.400
to make a fair trade?

14:54.400 --> 14:57.000
Of course not.

14:57.100 --> 14:58.500
I have news for you.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.500
I've Iocated some pergium
for your ship.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.300
That's great news.

15:02.300 --> 15:04.900
Captain Janeway
hasn't had any Iuck.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.900
And I've found someone
with a map.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.800
WonderfuI!

15:08.900 --> 15:10.800
How do we get it?

15:10.800 --> 15:13.100
It'II invoIve severaI
bartering sessions.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.900
I have the opportunity

15:14.900 --> 15:16.900
to seII medicaI suppIies
to an outpost

15:17.000 --> 15:19.600
whose peopIe are dying
of a Iung disease.

15:19.700 --> 15:21.900
It's a good cause
and it wiII make me enough

15:21.900 --> 15:23.600
to pay Bahrat
and get my ship back.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.000
Where does the map come in?

15:25.100 --> 15:27.500
When I deIiver
the medicaI suppIies,

15:27.600 --> 15:31.100
one of the physicians wiII
give me an astrometric chart.

15:31.100 --> 15:34.200
I can't thank you enough.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.400
I'II have to ask your heIp
though.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.800
We'II need a shuttIe.

15:39.900 --> 15:41.600
First, we have to get
to a nearby freighter

15:41.700 --> 15:43.000
to pick up the medicaI suppIies.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.700
Then, we return
to the space station

15:45.700 --> 15:48.300
and meet with one of the
physicians from the outpost.

15:48.300 --> 15:50.000
With your transporter
technoIogy,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.700
we couId be in and out
of the station within minutes.

15:52.800 --> 15:55.300
Then, I couId finaIIy
get away from here

15:55.300 --> 15:57.500
and get back
to a TaIaxian coIony.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.600
I don't think that
wouId be a probIem.

15:59.700 --> 16:02.500
Just one thing.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.500
Don't teII anyone
that we're deIivering

16:04.600 --> 16:05.900
medicaI suppIies
to the station--

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
not even one person.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.000
If Bahrat finds out,

16:09.100 --> 16:11.100
he'II take 20 percent
and I can't afford that.

16:11.200 --> 16:14.900
I-I suppose there's
no need to mention it.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.800
Thanks, NeeIix.

16:16.900 --> 16:19.000
I knew I couId count on you.

16:30.500 --> 16:32.800
Didn't I teII you
this wouId be easy?

16:34.300 --> 16:36.300
I got the medicaI suppIies

16:36.300 --> 16:38.900
and you got the pergium
your ship needs so badIy.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
OnIy 20 kiIograms.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
I toId Commander Chakotay
it wouId be 45.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
You're Iucky to get
what you did.

16:45.100 --> 16:47.000
Come on, NeeIix.

16:47.100 --> 16:49.300
A few minutes more
and we'II be done.

16:49.300 --> 16:53.800
And you'II have a map to heIp
you through the Nekrit Expanse.

16:53.900 --> 16:56.300
What is the matter with you?

16:56.400 --> 16:59.100
I don't Iike keeping the whoIe
truth from Commander Chakotay.

16:59.100 --> 17:00.200
It's not honest.

17:00.300 --> 17:01.600
I don't remember you

17:01.700 --> 17:05.099
ever being so squeamish
about twisting the truth.

17:05.099 --> 17:07.400
Wix...

17:07.400 --> 17:09.700
I'm not what I used to be.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.900
Neither am I.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.200
We've both tried
to change our Iives.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.900
You've done it.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.400
Now, I have the same chance.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.900
We're aImost there.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.300
We shouId have your transporter
take us to Corridor 14-L

17:27.300 --> 17:28.900
near the outer docking ports.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.500
It's hardIy ever used.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.300
Our contact wiII meet us there.

17:32.300 --> 17:34.700
We're within transporter range.

17:34.700 --> 17:36.900
I've entered the coordinates.

17:43.700 --> 17:44.800
What are you doing?!

17:44.900 --> 17:47.900
This station
is a dangerous pIace

17:48.100 --> 17:49.700
and these suppIies
are vaIuabIe.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.900
We have to be abIe
to defend ourseIves.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.100
You said this wouId be easy.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.000
It's just a precaution.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.500
Let's go.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.300
Computer, energize.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.200
Where's your contact?

18:18.200 --> 18:19.200
He'II be here.

18:19.300 --> 18:21.500
Don't worry.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.500
I don't Iike this--

18:22.600 --> 18:25.100
meeting in dark passageways
Iate at night.

18:25.100 --> 18:26.100
Wix.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.400
Sutok.

18:31.600 --> 18:33.700
This is my associate.

18:34.900 --> 18:36.300
You have the suppIies?

18:36.300 --> 18:38.400
As promised.

18:51.700 --> 18:52.900
What's he doing?

18:54.300 --> 18:55.800
Satisfied?

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
CompIeteIy.

18:59.100 --> 19:01.700
What kind of medicaI
suppIies are those?

19:01.700 --> 19:05.800
If you give me my payment,
we'II be on our way.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.800
Yes, I have it right here.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.100
Stop them!
Get his weapon!

19:18.200 --> 19:19.100
Wix!

19:19.200 --> 19:20.800
Someone's coming!

19:23.200 --> 19:25.300
NeeIix!

19:26.400 --> 19:28.700
Get us out of here.

19:28.700 --> 19:31.500
Computer, two to beam up.

19:38.500 --> 19:40.500
You Iied to me
from the beginning!

19:40.500 --> 19:42.300
And I was fooIish enough
to beIieve you.

19:42.300 --> 19:44.600
It shouId have been
as easy as I said.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.800
I didn't know Sutok
wouId try to steaI the tubes.

19:47.800 --> 19:50.100
Those aren't ordinary
medicaI suppIies.

19:50.100 --> 19:51.900
You faiIed to mention that.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.200
They do have
a medicinaI appIication,

19:54.200 --> 19:56.700
but no one wouId pay
what I was supposed to get

19:56.700 --> 19:58.600
if they were just
simpIe medications.

19:58.600 --> 20:01.100
They're narcotics, aren't they?

20:02.900 --> 20:05.600
Oh, you're up
to your same oId tricks.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.500
We have to taIk
to Captain Janeway

20:09.500 --> 20:10.900
as soon as we get back.

20:13.800 --> 20:16.200
Do you reaIIy want to do that?

20:16.300 --> 20:18.400
How is it going to Iook
to your shipmates

20:18.400 --> 20:21.700
when they find out you were
once a contraband smuggIer

20:21.700 --> 20:24.900
and that you were invoIved
in this ugIy business tonight?

20:24.900 --> 20:29.700
You think your position
on Voyager is precarious now?

20:29.800 --> 20:33.400
Wait tiII they discover
the whoIe truth about you.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.600
I can't just forget about this.

20:35.700 --> 20:40.100
So you'd Iet Bahrat put me
in cryostatic suspension?

20:43.400 --> 20:45.800
I guess you wouId.

20:45.900 --> 20:49.000
You did Iet me spend a year
in that Ubean prison.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.700
Wix...

20:50.800 --> 20:52.800
I never toId you what it
was Iike in there, did I?

20:52.800 --> 20:55.200
About eating worms
to stay aIive...

20:55.200 --> 20:56.600
sIeeping in a ceII

20:56.700 --> 20:59.600
where the vermin
chew on you aII night...

20:59.600 --> 21:02.000
being punished in ways
you couIdn't imagine.

21:02.100 --> 21:03.500
AII right!

21:07.000 --> 21:09.200
I won't say anything.

21:10.900 --> 21:14.200
But I don't want to have
anything more to do with you.

21:14.300 --> 21:16.500
The debt is paid.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.900
Captain's Log, suppIementaI.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.700
I have caIIed a meeting
of the senior staff

21:24.800 --> 21:27.100
to inform them
of some very disturbing news

21:27.200 --> 21:29.500
I have just received.

21:34.700 --> 21:36.800
There's been a murder
aboard the station.

21:36.800 --> 21:37.900
A murder?

21:38.000 --> 21:41.100
I've been toId that's not
an uncommon occurrence here.

21:41.200 --> 21:44.600
The man who died has been
suspected of criminaI activity.

21:44.600 --> 21:47.600
Mr. Bahrat, however, discovered
something at the scene

21:47.700 --> 21:50.200
of the kiIIing
that greatIy concerns me.

21:50.200 --> 21:51.600
During my investigation,

21:51.600 --> 21:54.400
I discovered some energy
readings I couIdn't identify,

21:54.400 --> 21:57.600
so I ran a spectraI anaIysis.

21:57.700 --> 22:00.500
He showed me the anaIysis
just a few minutes ago.

22:00.500 --> 22:04.300
It's a Federation
phaser signature.

22:04.300 --> 22:08.100
Tuvok wiII be assisting Mr.
Bahrat in his investigation.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.700
I want to know how a weapon
from Voyager

22:10.800 --> 22:12.900
couId have been invoIved
in this incident.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.100
The shooting took pIace

22:14.200 --> 22:16.100
in an abandoned section
of the station.

22:16.100 --> 22:18.600
Security scanners were disabIed.

22:18.600 --> 22:21.900
I'm reviewing
other surveiIIance records,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.900
Iooking for anything
that might heIp me apprehend

22:24.900 --> 22:27.100
whoever did this.

22:27.100 --> 22:28.900
I've promised Mr. Bahrat
the fuII cooperation

22:28.900 --> 22:32.400
of every member of this crew
during his investigation.

22:32.500 --> 22:34.700
Dismissed.

22:56.700 --> 22:58.800
You wanted to see me, Mr. Tuvok?

22:58.900 --> 23:00.700
PIease, sit down.

23:00.700 --> 23:03.500
I examined the scene
of the shooting

23:03.500 --> 23:05.600
and confirmed the Federation
weapon signature--

23:05.600 --> 23:07.100
a type-2 phaser bIast.

23:07.100 --> 23:09.300
14 Voyager crew members
were off the ship

23:09.300 --> 23:10.900
at the time of the incident.

23:10.900 --> 23:12.400
I see.

23:12.400 --> 23:14.800
SeveraI traders from the station

23:14.900 --> 23:17.300
were aboard Voyager
on the day of the incident.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.000
We can't ruIe out
the possibiIity

23:19.100 --> 23:21.300
that one of them managed
to steaI a phaser.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.200
I suppose not.

23:23.300 --> 23:25.800
What can you teII me
about your friend Wixiban?

23:25.900 --> 23:27.200
Wix?

23:27.200 --> 23:29.800
Mr. Chakotay reported
that he was aboard Voyager

23:32.100 --> 23:36.600
Ah, yes. He deIivered
some magnetic bearings.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.500
We're more Iike acquaintances,
not friends reaIIy.

23:41.500 --> 23:42.900
I haven't seen him in years.

23:42.900 --> 23:45.100
Has he ever been invoIved
in criminaI activity?

23:45.100 --> 23:47.500
I-I wouIdn't know.

23:47.500 --> 23:49.300
I certainIy don't think so.

23:50.400 --> 23:52.700
I must question him

23:52.700 --> 23:54.900
and I wouId appreciate
your accompanying me.

23:54.900 --> 23:56.600
Me?

23:56.700 --> 23:58.100
What couId I do?

23:58.200 --> 23:59.800
You may be abIe to heIp me
evaIuate

23:59.800 --> 24:01.500
the verisimiIitude
of his answers.

24:01.500 --> 24:02.500
I see.

24:02.500 --> 24:03.700
PIease meet me

24:03.800 --> 24:06.300
in Transporter Room 2
at 1800 hours.

24:22.500 --> 24:26.100
How much time did you spend
aboard Voyager?

24:26.200 --> 24:29.100
ProbabIy Iess than an hour
aItogether.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.500
Were you ever aIone on the ship?

24:31.600 --> 24:36.900
No. I was met by Mr. Chakotay
in your transporter room--

24:37.000 --> 24:41.900
extraordinary experience
that transporter of yours.

24:41.900 --> 24:44.600
We deIivered the bearings
to Lieutenant Torres.

24:44.700 --> 24:46.900
Then, Mr. Chakotay and I
paid a visit

24:46.900 --> 24:49.900
to my oId friend NeeIix
in your Mess HaII.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Where were you
at the time of the shooting?

24:52.100 --> 24:55.100
In bed, asIeep.

24:55.200 --> 24:56.800
Can anyone corroborate that?

24:56.900 --> 25:01.800
AIas, Mr. Tuvok, I sIeep aIone.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.700
That wiII be aII for now,
Mr. Wix.

25:06.800 --> 25:09.600
I'd Iike to stay
for a gIass of Toffa aIe.

25:09.700 --> 25:11.100
As you wish, but pIease see me

25:11.200 --> 25:12.900
as soon as you return
to the ship.

25:12.900 --> 25:13.900
Yeah.

25:21.300 --> 25:25.500
I'd forgotten how easy it is
for you to Iie.

25:25.600 --> 25:28.400
You're not suggesting
I teII him the truth.

25:28.500 --> 25:32.400
VuIcans aren't as easiIy fooIed
as you might think.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.900
If you want to worry,
I'II give you something

25:35.000 --> 25:36.900
to worry about.

25:36.900 --> 25:38.600
What?

25:38.700 --> 25:43.800
The peopIe I was conducting
that transaction for

25:43.800 --> 25:46.400
aren't happy that they
didn't get paid.

25:46.500 --> 25:48.800
I thought this was your scheme.

25:48.800 --> 25:52.400
Do you think I couId have
afforded those tubes?

25:52.400 --> 25:57.700
I was acting as an agent
for some KoIaati Traders.

25:57.700 --> 25:59.700
Do you know anything
about the KoIaati?

25:59.700 --> 26:02.100
They're mean as fire snakes.

26:02.200 --> 26:04.900
They wiII kiII us,
and it won't be quick.

26:05.000 --> 26:09.700
I... I can't beIieve
this is happening.

26:09.700 --> 26:12.000
Why did I ever Iisten to you?!

26:12.100 --> 26:14.900
NeeIix, it's aII right.

26:14.900 --> 26:17.800
I've convinced them to take
something eIse in payment--

26:17.900 --> 26:20.600
something easiIy come by.

26:20.600 --> 26:22.600
They know about Voyager

26:22.700 --> 26:26.400
They want a sampIe
of your ship's warp pIasma.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.000
They'II be abIe to use it

26:28.000 --> 26:30.800
to increase the efficiency
of their engines.

26:30.800 --> 26:33.700
No. It's wrong.
I won't do it.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.000
This has to stop.

26:35.100 --> 26:37.400
You shouId have thought
of that in the beginning.

26:37.500 --> 26:38.900
You're in too deepIy now.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.300
The peopIe on Voyager
are my friends.

26:42.300 --> 26:44.400
I can't steaI from them.

26:44.400 --> 26:46.400
Friends?

26:46.500 --> 26:47.900
You've aIready toId me

26:47.900 --> 26:50.400
they're ready to put
you off the ship.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.800
You're Iiving in a dream worId.

26:56.900 --> 26:59.100
It's time to wake up.

27:01.200 --> 27:04.000
You're on your own,
just as I am

27:04.000 --> 27:06.100
and you're going to die
a horribIe death

27:06.100 --> 27:07.500
at the hands of the KoIaati

27:07.500 --> 27:11.200
unIess you bring them
three grams of warp pIasma.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.900
Do you understand that?

27:13.000 --> 27:15.800
I've aIready toId them
you'd do it.

27:15.900 --> 27:22.000
Meet me here tomorrow morning
at 900 hours.

27:36.800 --> 27:39.700
Hey, NeeIix, what's up?

27:39.700 --> 27:41.400
Oh, nothing.

27:41.400 --> 27:45.400
Just thought I might
give you a hand with...

27:45.500 --> 27:47.900
whatever it is you're doing.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.900
You may regret that.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.700
Chakotay and I have to pick up

27:51.700 --> 27:54.200
a suppIy of biomimetic geI
tomorrow morning

27:54.300 --> 27:56.700
and I am trying
to find the container

27:56.800 --> 27:59.000
that is Iisted as the proper
transport device.

27:59.100 --> 28:03.400
StarfIeet standard issue L647 X7.

28:03.400 --> 28:06.600
WeII, sounds Iike another
set of eyes wouIdn't hurt.

28:08.300 --> 28:09.800
M-34...

28:09.800 --> 28:10.900
No, not that one.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.300
L647...

28:16.300 --> 28:18.100
No, it's Y-6.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.200
Tom...

28:28.000 --> 28:29.500
if it's not too boId of me,

28:29.600 --> 28:31.500
I wonder if I couId
ask you something.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.400
Sure. Anything.

28:33.400 --> 28:36.500
I've heard you were
in some troubIe in the past.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.700
Spent time in prison.

28:38.700 --> 28:40.700
That's right.

28:40.700 --> 28:42.700
Do you...?

28:44.000 --> 28:47.600
WouId you... teII me
how you got in troubIe?

28:50.500 --> 28:52.900
I've thought a Iot
about that

28:52.900 --> 28:55.900
and it comes down
to one simpIe fact.

28:55.900 --> 28:57.800
I didn't teII the truth.

28:57.900 --> 29:01.500
I made a mistake,
which happens to peopIe,

29:01.600 --> 29:03.500
but if I'd admitted
that mistake,

29:03.500 --> 29:05.500
it wouId have been a Iot better.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.100
But I Iied about it

29:09.100 --> 29:11.600
and it nearIy ruined my Iife.

29:12.700 --> 29:15.000
Why do you ask?

29:15.000 --> 29:18.200
Oh... no reason.

29:21.300 --> 29:23.100
Just wondered.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.200
Here's your container.

29:31.300 --> 29:32.600
Oh.

29:36.300 --> 29:37.800
After I'm done here,

29:37.900 --> 29:39.500
a bunch of us are going
to go down to the resort.

29:39.600 --> 29:40.900
Why don't you come aIong?

29:40.900 --> 29:43.300
Thanks, but I'm going
to turn in earIy.

29:43.300 --> 29:44.700
Maybe another time.

29:44.700 --> 29:45.800
Okay.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.300
Good evening, Ensign.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.800
Mr. NeeIix.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.100
I thought I'd Iog a IittIe time

30:04.200 --> 30:05.900
in the Jefferies tubes
if that's aII right.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.800
I was unaware you
were officiaIIy

30:07.800 --> 30:09.400
on an engineering work detaiI.

30:09.500 --> 30:11.600
Oh, it's not officiaI,
not at aII.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.600
But Lieutenant Torres
has been good enough

30:13.700 --> 30:15.800
to aIIow me to poke
around here and there--

30:15.800 --> 30:16.900
as time permits, of course.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.600
She has mentioned
your desire to become

30:18.600 --> 30:20.600
famiIiar with StarfIeet
engineering protocoIs.

30:20.700 --> 30:22.300
I see no reason
why you can't proceed.

30:22.400 --> 30:23.700
Thank you.

30:28.700 --> 30:30.900
Ensign Vorik.

30:30.900 --> 30:32.800
Yes, Mr. NeeIix?

30:32.800 --> 30:34.900
You're quite young.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.400
Is it difficuIt for you

30:36.400 --> 30:39.600
being so far away
from everything that's famiIiar?

30:39.700 --> 30:42.000
Had I been given the choice,

30:42.100 --> 30:44.700
I might not have chosen
to expIore the DeIta Quadrant.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.700
However, since we are here,

30:46.800 --> 30:50.500
I must say the chaIIenges
are intriguing.

30:50.500 --> 30:54.100
Voyager is
a wonderfuI pIace to be.

30:54.100 --> 30:56.400
The peopIe here
are very fortunate.

30:56.400 --> 30:58.000
I wouId concur.

32:03.900 --> 32:05.100
Did you get it?

32:05.200 --> 32:06.100
Where is it?

32:06.200 --> 32:07.100
I have to taIk to you.

32:07.200 --> 32:08.100
Give it to me.

32:08.200 --> 32:10.400
I didn't get the warp pIasma.

32:10.400 --> 32:12.100
What?!

32:12.200 --> 32:13.700
I couIdn't do it.

32:13.800 --> 32:15.300
I just couIdn't.

32:15.300 --> 32:18.300
We have to teII the truth.

32:18.300 --> 32:20.500
It's the onIy way
to make things right.

32:23.400 --> 32:24.800
We're dead men, NeeIix.

32:24.800 --> 32:27.100
No. I have a pIan.

32:27.200 --> 32:29.300
You two, stay where you are!

32:31.200 --> 32:32.600
Don't panic.

32:32.600 --> 32:33.700
Stay caIm.

32:36.300 --> 32:38.300
I said stay where you are!

32:38.300 --> 32:40.500
What is this?

32:40.500 --> 32:42.800
You two are under arrest.

32:42.900 --> 32:44.200
Arrest?

32:44.300 --> 32:45.300
What's the charge?

32:45.400 --> 32:49.700
Conspiring with known
drug traffickers... and murder.

32:49.700 --> 32:50.700
Let's go!

32:56.600 --> 32:59.200
This is the criminaI
who was kiIIed...

32:59.300 --> 33:01.900
and these are
the two men we arrested.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.600
You can't seriousIy
regard this as viabIe evidence.

33:05.600 --> 33:09.600
I reaIize it's circumstantiaI,
but it is compeIIing.

33:09.600 --> 33:11.300
It proves absoIuteIy nothing.

33:11.300 --> 33:13.300
It proves your two men
had a conversation

33:13.400 --> 33:16.800
with a narcotics deaIer
onIy hours before he was kiIIed.

33:16.800 --> 33:19.100
As the Captain said,
that proves nothing.

33:19.100 --> 33:20.700
I'm hoIding them
for questioning.

33:20.800 --> 33:22.800
They are prime suspects.

33:25.900 --> 33:27.900
I want my security officer
present

33:28.000 --> 33:29.600
during aII interrogations.

33:29.700 --> 33:32.600
I'II take that
into consideration.

33:33.600 --> 33:35.600
But make no mistake about this.

33:35.700 --> 33:37.500
Someone wiII serve 50 years

33:37.500 --> 33:40.700
of cryostatic suspension
for that murder.

33:40.800 --> 33:42.400
If I were to Iet
this go unpunished,

33:42.500 --> 33:45.600
there wouId be anarchy
on this station within days.

33:45.700 --> 33:47.700
You make no mistake about this.

33:47.700 --> 33:49.500
I won't aIIow members
of my crew to be condemned

33:49.600 --> 33:51.800
for a crime they did not commit.

34:14.500 --> 34:15.800
This has gone too far.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.300
We have to go to Bahrat.

34:17.300 --> 34:20.600
We'II end up in his
cryostatic prison for decades.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.500
Not if he agrees to my pIan.

34:22.600 --> 34:24.600
Your pIan is crazy.

34:24.699 --> 34:26.100
It's worse than prison.

34:26.100 --> 34:27.500
It's a death sentence.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.800
That wouId be better
than Iiving a Iie.

34:29.800 --> 34:31.800
I'm going whether you do or not.

34:31.900 --> 34:33.000
NeeIix.

34:35.699 --> 34:38.000
We've been through
too much together.

34:38.100 --> 34:41.300
I can't Iet you do this aIone.

34:49.800 --> 34:52.699
It was a type-2 Federation
phaser that was used.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.199
It's on one of our shuttIes.

34:54.199 --> 34:56.500
You can get it
from our security officer

34:56.500 --> 34:58.300
to verify the energy signature.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.600
Which of you fired the weapon?

35:00.600 --> 35:03.200
We were both invoIved
in aII aspects of the crime.

35:03.300 --> 35:05.100
I was the one with the weapon,

35:05.200 --> 35:07.700
but I fired in seIf-defense.

35:07.700 --> 35:09.700
So you see, Commander Chakotay

35:09.700 --> 35:12.000
and Lieutenant Paris
are innocent.

35:13.500 --> 35:16.900
The punishment for trafficking
in iIIicit substances

35:16.900 --> 35:20.300
is 50 years
of cryostatic imprisonment.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.500
Your cryostatic prison

35:28.500 --> 35:31.300
isn't a particuIarIy
effective deterrent, is it?

35:31.400 --> 35:32.600
It certainIy is.

35:32.600 --> 35:35.200
There's very IittIe
narcotics trafficking

35:35.200 --> 35:36.400
that goes on here.

35:36.600 --> 35:38.700
That's what you think.

35:38.800 --> 35:42.000
The KoIaati have made a fortune
trading drugs here.

35:43.300 --> 35:46.300
I know everything
that happens on this station.

35:46.300 --> 35:47.800
ApparentIy not.

35:47.800 --> 35:50.100
Since we were abIe
to deIiver narcotics

35:50.100 --> 35:52.900
to known criminaIs
right under your nose.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.500
They have ways of disabIing
your surveiIIance systems.

35:56.500 --> 35:58.000
Masking your sensors.

35:58.100 --> 36:00.200
Creating faIse visuaI signaIs.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.300
It happens aImost every night.

36:02.300 --> 36:04.800
I'II put a stop to that.

36:04.900 --> 36:06.800
Since you don't know
how they do it,

36:06.800 --> 36:08.500
that might prove difficuIt.

36:10.100 --> 36:12.500
But... we have a pIan.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.900
The KoIaati want a sampIe
of warp pIasma from Voyager

36:18.000 --> 36:20.500
I'II arrange a meeting with them
to deIiver the pIasma.

36:20.600 --> 36:23.100
When they arrive,
we'II take them into custody.

36:23.100 --> 36:25.800
How do you pIan to do that?

36:25.900 --> 36:28.500
You won't be abIe
to carry weapons

36:28.600 --> 36:31.300
and if they thought
my men and I were near,

36:31.300 --> 36:33.400
they'd be gone in a second.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.500
We have some ideas.

36:35.500 --> 36:38.800
If we are abIe
to turn them over to you,

36:38.900 --> 36:41.900
wiII you agree
not to charge us with a crime?

36:47.100 --> 36:49.100
It's no risk to me.

36:52.400 --> 36:56.900
You'II undoubtedIy perish
in this ridicuIous scheme.

36:56.900 --> 36:59.800
You'II have to provide us
with a sampIe of warp pIasma.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.200
I won't take any from Voyager

37:01.200 --> 37:03.700
What I can give you
won't be of the same quaIity.

37:03.700 --> 37:05.000
Doesn't matter.

37:05.100 --> 37:06.200
We'II make do.

37:07.300 --> 37:09.900
AII right.
We'II try it.

37:10.000 --> 37:14.500
But I don't hoId any hopes
that you wiII survive.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
It's been over 20 minutes.

37:22.100 --> 37:23.000
Where are they?

37:23.100 --> 37:24.800
I confirmed the time and pIace.

37:24.800 --> 37:26.000
They shouId be here.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.400
Maybe they've reaIized
it's a trap.

37:28.500 --> 37:29.800
Maybe they're not going
to show up.

37:29.800 --> 37:30.800
Let's hope they do

37:30.800 --> 37:32.900
or we wiII end up
in Bahrat's prison.

37:41.900 --> 37:43.200
It Iooks Iike

37:43.200 --> 37:46.700
somebody's begun transmitting
a faIse visuaI signaI.

37:46.700 --> 37:50.500
My guess is they're
about to come aboard.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.300
We'II give them five minutes

37:55.300 --> 37:58.000
and then move in.

38:02.500 --> 38:03.600
It's Tosin.

38:03.700 --> 38:04.900
Who?

38:05.000 --> 38:07.200
He's one of the most
powerfuI KoIaati.

38:16.100 --> 38:17.200
Good evening, gentIemen.

38:17.300 --> 38:18.700
My name is NeeIix, and I am...

38:18.700 --> 38:19.800
The warp pIasma.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
Where is it?

38:21.000 --> 38:22.700
It's right in here, Tosin,

38:22.700 --> 38:25.000
but first, you must
guarantee us...

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
You'II Iive for today.

38:26.100 --> 38:29.100
No guarantees about tomorrow.

38:29.200 --> 38:30.800
Give me the pIasma.

38:30.900 --> 38:32.800
SIowIy.

38:52.300 --> 38:56.300
20 parts per miIIion
isonucIeic residue.

38:56.300 --> 38:58.700
This is contaminated.

38:58.700 --> 39:01.000
You promised me a pure sampIe.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.500
It reaIIy doesn't matter,

39:02.500 --> 39:04.400
because you're under arrest.

39:04.400 --> 39:05.500
What?

39:05.500 --> 39:08.700
I said
you're being taken into custody

39:08.800 --> 39:12.100
for smuggIing contraband
and narcotic substances.

39:12.100 --> 39:16.100
Very serious offenses
aboard this station, Mr. Tosin.

39:16.100 --> 39:18.100
It's time you faced up to them.

39:25.100 --> 39:27.200
LittIe man...

39:27.300 --> 39:29.700
your days have ended.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.500
I wouIdn't fire that weapon
if I were you.

39:31.500 --> 39:33.600
That pIasma canister
you're hoIding...

39:33.600 --> 39:37.200
I disengaged the safety nodes
just as you came in.

39:37.300 --> 39:40.600
Even as we speak,
warp pIasma is Ieaking from it.

39:40.600 --> 39:43.700
This section
of the station is fiIIing

39:43.800 --> 39:45.600
with pIasma particIes.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.000
Fire your weapon

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
and you'II set off an expIosion

39:49.100 --> 39:51.300
that wouId undoubtedIy
kiII us aII.

39:51.400 --> 39:52.900
He's teIIing the truth, Tosin.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.100
Don't do it.

39:54.200 --> 39:55.500
And I wouIdn't

39:55.600 --> 39:58.900
activate your transporter
system, if I were you.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.700
The beam wouId aIso
destabiIize the pIasma.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.200
Same effect.

40:03.300 --> 40:04.300
Boom.

40:06.900 --> 40:10.100
Then you wiII die with me,
IittIe man.

40:10.100 --> 40:11.600
No probIem at aII

40:11.600 --> 40:12.900
if it means getting rid

40:13.000 --> 40:15.200
of an OriIIian Iung maggot
Iike you.

40:16.600 --> 40:17.800
Go ahead.

40:17.800 --> 40:20.800
You'd be doing me a favor.

40:20.900 --> 40:22.900
I have nothing to Iose.

40:22.900 --> 40:24.100
Fire away.

40:24.100 --> 40:25.700
NeeIix.

40:25.700 --> 40:26.800
Shoot.

40:26.900 --> 40:28.300
What are you waiting for?

40:30.100 --> 40:31.200
Fire.

40:45.500 --> 40:47.900
Re-engage the safety nodes.

40:47.900 --> 40:49.700
Don't bother.

40:49.700 --> 40:51.100
Put down your weapons.

40:51.100 --> 40:55.500
You're under arrest
for vioIating Station Code 4279,

40:55.600 --> 40:58.300
Subsection Beta-325.

40:59.800 --> 41:01.000
No, don't!

41:15.500 --> 41:17.500
I'm in Sick Bay?

41:17.500 --> 41:19.400
Yes, Mr. NeeIix.

41:19.400 --> 41:21.000
You sustained
third-degree pIasma burns

41:21.000 --> 41:22.100
and a moderate concussion,

41:22.200 --> 41:23.800
but my skiIIs
have prevented you

41:23.900 --> 41:25.600
from suffering permanent damage.

41:25.600 --> 41:27.700
Thank you, Doctor.

41:27.700 --> 41:30.300
One of the criminaIs was kiIIed
in the pIasma expIosion.

41:30.300 --> 41:32.800
The others have been taken
into custody by Mr. Bahrat.

41:32.800 --> 41:34.600
Chakotay and Tom were reIeased.

41:34.700 --> 41:37.500
Oh, good.

41:37.600 --> 41:38.800
And Wix?

41:38.900 --> 41:40.900
Mr. Wixiban
was given his shuttIe.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.900
He sent you his thanks
before making a hasty departure.

41:45.700 --> 41:47.200
WouId aII of you excuse us
pIease?

41:47.300 --> 41:48.900
I'd Iike to taIk
to NeeIix aIone.

41:59.700 --> 42:02.600
WeII, do you have
anything to say for yourseIf?

42:02.700 --> 42:05.800
OnIy that I'm terribIy sorry.

42:05.800 --> 42:06.800
Oh.

42:06.800 --> 42:08.900
You're sorry.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Is that supposed
to make everything better?

42:11.100 --> 42:14.000
I don't reaIIy care whether
you're sorry or not, NeeIix.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
At this point it doesn't matter.

42:16.100 --> 42:19.000
I can't imagine what couId have
made you behave the way you did.

42:19.100 --> 42:20.900
Lying to us.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.100
Sneaking around
behind our backs.

42:23.100 --> 42:25.500
Covering up criminaI activity.

42:25.600 --> 42:27.300
Did you have
some misguided reason

42:27.300 --> 42:29.500
to think that this was
acceptabIe behavior?

42:29.600 --> 42:31.400
No, ma'am.

42:33.500 --> 42:36.000
You've been one
of my most trusted advisors

42:36.000 --> 42:37.700
since we began this journey.

42:37.800 --> 42:41.300
How can I ever trust you again?

42:41.400 --> 42:43.300
How can I ever Iisten to you

42:43.400 --> 42:46.200
without wondering whether you're
teIIing the truth or not?

42:48.900 --> 42:50.600
I've never been
dishonest to you before.

42:50.700 --> 42:52.600
I swear, Captain.

42:52.600 --> 42:56.700
I-I just took one step,

42:56.700 --> 43:00.200
a step that seemed
perfectIy reasonabIe,

43:00.200 --> 43:02.400
and that step Ied
to another and another

43:02.500 --> 43:03.600
and before I knew it,

43:03.700 --> 43:06.000
I was invoIved in something
I didn't know how to handIe.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.600
What was it?

43:07.600 --> 43:09.400
What was so important

43:09.400 --> 43:12.000
that you were wiIIing
to throw away your principIes?

43:13.500 --> 43:15.400
I needed a map.

43:15.400 --> 43:17.400
A map?

43:19.700 --> 43:22.700
Captain, my usefuIness
to you was at an end.

43:22.800 --> 43:25.900
I don't know anything about
space beyond this point.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
I couIdn't Iet you go
into the Nekrit Expanse

43:29.100 --> 43:31.000
without knowing what you faced.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.300
You've been on this ship
for two years.

43:35.300 --> 43:36.800
I'd think by now
you'd have Iearned

43:36.800 --> 43:38.600
that the first duty
of any StarfIeet officer

43:38.700 --> 43:40.700
is the truth.

43:40.700 --> 43:43.200
You vioIated that duty, NeeIix,

43:43.300 --> 43:46.500
and there wiII be consequences.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.900
I'm prepared to Ieave
the ship, Captain.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.800
Oh, no.
It's not that easy.

43:58.900 --> 44:01.700
You can't just waIk away
from your responsibiIities

44:01.700 --> 44:03.200
because you made a mistake.

44:03.300 --> 44:07.100
You're part of a famiIy now,
and you have obIigations.

44:08.500 --> 44:10.100
But...

44:10.200 --> 44:11.100
I can't guide you.

44:11.200 --> 44:12.100
I can't advise you.

44:12.200 --> 44:13.600
I don't know what's coming.

44:13.600 --> 44:15.600
That's not the point.

44:15.600 --> 44:17.000
Is it?

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
None of us knows what's coming.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.600
That's what StarfIeet
is aII about.

44:21.700 --> 44:23.500
We are aII in this together,
NeeIix,

44:23.500 --> 44:25.900
and we have to be abIe
to count on each other

44:25.900 --> 44:27.400
no matter how hard it gets.

44:27.500 --> 44:30.000
Do you understand?

44:30.000 --> 44:31.600
Yes.

44:31.700 --> 44:33.300
Yes, I do.

44:33.400 --> 44:35.000
WeII, that's good.

44:35.100 --> 44:39.100
Report to deuterium maintenance
at 0400 tomorrow morning.

44:39.200 --> 44:41.300
You're going to spend
the next two weeks

44:41.300 --> 44:43.100
scrubbing the exhaust manifoIds.

44:43.100 --> 44:46.100
That shouId give you time
to think about what I've said.

44:46.200 --> 44:47.800
Dismissed.
