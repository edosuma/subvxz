00:02.129 --> 00:03.810
Previously on Angel...

00:06.730 --> 00:08.029
Landok, is that you?

00:07.929 --> 00:09.960
Landokmar of the Deathwok Clan.

00:10.929 --> 00:12.650
- The two of you are...?
- Cousins.

00:12.730 --> 00:16.589
Show the cleavage, say the line.
Don't waste more of our time, princess.

00:18.129 --> 00:19.809
I just wanted to act.

00:19.929 --> 00:22.559
- You should've waited for me,
- We waited for months,

00:23.530 --> 00:25.140
We're looking for someone working here.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.539
Fred disappeared 5 years ago.
They never found her.

00:27.730 --> 00:28.890
Here it is.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.460
Fred was holding this book
in my vision,

00:31.929 --> 00:33.009
The portal works both ways,

00:40.770 --> 00:43.509
Cordy? Cordy?

00:48.130 --> 00:49.250
Cordelia?

00:53.530 --> 00:57.880
Oh, no. Oh, my God, no.
How could I have let this happen?

00:58.329 --> 01:00.789
No, she's here somewhere.
She's just hiding.

01:02.530 --> 01:03.609
- What?
- She's gone.

01:05.530 --> 01:08.859
Sucked into the portal.
She's in the Host's dimension.

01:09.730 --> 01:11.760
Where's Cordelia?

01:16.930 --> 01:18.819
Angel?

01:20.530 --> 01:22.349
Wesley!

01:24.730 --> 01:27.219
Mr. Green Mojo Guy's cousin?

01:28.930 --> 01:31.319
Help!

01:34.329 --> 01:35.310
Right.

01:36.730 --> 01:41.400
Good one, Cor. Scream very loudly
so the hell-beasts come to you.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:54.890 --> 01:56.219
Worth a shot.

01:57.290 --> 01:58.519
So...

02:00.290 --> 02:02.819
...silver lining.

02:03.290 --> 02:06.060
It's kind of a pretty place,
when you look at it.

02:07.489 --> 02:10.439
Woodsy woods. Sunny and mild.

02:15.889 --> 02:20.000
Giant hairy hell-beast staring at me.

02:20.689 --> 02:23.500
That's incredibly frightening.
Good hell-beast.

02:24.289 --> 02:27.939
You're a lazy hell-beast, aren't you?
Yes!

02:29.090 --> 02:31.930
You'll stay right there
while I run for my life.

03:32.050 --> 03:34.009
I don't know where she is.

03:34.449 --> 03:36.909
My world, sure,
but who knows if she even....

03:37.449 --> 03:40.539
Because there's the--
With the--

03:42.849 --> 03:45.409
- I wish I could get drunk.
- Let's be logical.

03:46.449 --> 03:48.870
Screw logic.
We're getting Cordy back.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.530
We'll open up another portal.
We'll go in after her.

03:57.250 --> 03:58.900
- Not a good idea.
- I don't care.

03:59.050 --> 04:01.509
We're unprepared. Let's go
to the hotel, do research--

04:02.650 --> 04:06.689
No! I want to jump through the big
swirly hole thingy and save Cordelia.

04:07.449 --> 04:09.479
We might never be able to get back.

04:11.050 --> 04:12.210
It's Cordy.

04:22.449 --> 04:23.750
Oh, crap.

04:29.050 --> 04:31.860
Maybe I have to stand
where the portal opened.

04:44.050 --> 04:46.470
What, out of batteries?
Is it out of batteries?

04:47.050 --> 04:48.870
I don't know.
I don't know how it works.

04:49.449 --> 04:50.639
Damn it!

04:59.649 --> 05:01.050
I just got her back.

05:01.449 --> 05:05.100
There won't be any big swirly
hole-jumping without a big swirly hole.

05:05.649 --> 05:07.680
Yeah, right.

05:09.850 --> 05:12.480
Back to the hotel,
figure out how to make one.

05:13.449 --> 05:15.379
Maybe it's best
that you can't get in.

05:17.649 --> 05:19.470
- What?
- I'm just saying, my world?

05:21.250 --> 05:24.339
You don't want to jump into my world
looking like that.

05:24.850 --> 05:27.199
- Like what?
- Like a human.

05:41.370 --> 05:42.879
I can't die like this!

05:47.170 --> 05:48.540
Oh, thank God!

05:48.970 --> 05:50.689
And also, eew!

05:50.769 --> 05:53.259
Come here, boy! Seekul!

05:55.569 --> 05:57.319
Come here. Come on.

06:01.769 --> 06:03.730
Yes, yes.
Yes, yes, yes.

06:05.370 --> 06:06.600
Good boy, Seekul.

06:07.170 --> 06:08.540
Really cute...

06:08.970 --> 06:10.339
...thing you've got there.

06:10.769 --> 06:13.649
Personally, I've always been
a real thing-lover.

06:14.370 --> 06:18.089
Good boy, good boy.
You found me a cow.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.420
Who you calling "cow," mister?

06:26.370 --> 06:28.089
Um.... Uh-oh.

06:28.769 --> 06:31.300
A fine old cow. Good cow.

06:31.769 --> 06:34.120
Should fetch a pretty price
at the market.

06:34.769 --> 06:37.790
Okay, but you're like Hindu, right?

06:39.569 --> 06:40.829
You don't eat the cows?

06:40.769 --> 06:44.100
Kind of a chatty cow, huh, Seekul?

06:44.970 --> 06:46.439
That'll drive down the price.

06:46.769 --> 06:48.449
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

06:49.170 --> 06:50.149
Start talking,

06:50.449 --> 06:53.779
About my dimension? Sure.
I was there, I came here.

06:54.649 --> 06:57.810
I like here, I don't want to go there.
Is that all? I need--

06:58.250 --> 06:59.300
Sit.

07:02.449 --> 07:05.189
How'd you get from your world to here?

07:06.050 --> 07:07.240
Through a portal.

07:07.850 --> 07:10.199
- How did you open that portal?
- I didn't.

07:13.250 --> 07:14.230
You're not helping.

07:15.649 --> 07:17.930
It's no secret that I hate Pylea.

07:20.449 --> 07:22.100
- Pylea?
- My home dimension.

07:22.850 --> 07:25.019
Back then, I would've done
anything to get out.

07:25.250 --> 07:28.060
So one day, five years ago,
I'm in the woods...

07:28.850 --> 07:31.899
...when suddenly, out of nowhere,
a portal appears.

07:32.449 --> 07:34.410
Like an answer to my prayers.

07:34.850 --> 07:37.410
- You knew it was a portal?
- At first, I didn't.

07:37.850 --> 07:39.389
But when I got closer...

07:40.250 --> 07:43.269
...it goes all bendy, flashy light,
whoosh through the portal...

07:43.850 --> 07:45.290
...bang, I'm in another dimension.

07:46.250 --> 07:48.350
This dimension,
which I love and adore...

07:48.649 --> 07:50.370
...and will never, never, never leave.

07:50.449 --> 07:53.290
But then, who opened the portal?

07:56.449 --> 07:57.709
Gift horse.

07:58.250 --> 07:59.300
Mouth.

08:01.250 --> 08:03.850
So where did you end up
in this dimension?

08:04.850 --> 08:07.620
In an abandoned building,
unlike any I'd ever seen.

08:07.850 --> 08:11.110
That's when I realized
I'd been delivered from hell.

08:12.649 --> 08:14.399
I created Caritas on that spot.

08:15.050 --> 08:17.930
So Pylea's a hell dimension?
Cordy's stuck in hell?

08:18.050 --> 08:19.060
Not literally.

08:21.649 --> 08:24.069
- It runs a close second.
- Hard to believe.

08:24.050 --> 08:25.350
Do you?

08:25.850 --> 08:27.250
Well, try this.

08:27.649 --> 08:31.509
They have no music there.
It doesn't exist.

08:32.450 --> 08:34.169
Do you know what that's like?

08:34.850 --> 08:36.529
No lullabies, no love songs.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.779
I thought I was crazy,
that I had ghosts in my head...

08:40.250 --> 08:43.299
...simply because I could hear music.

08:43.850 --> 08:47.110
I didn't know it was music.
I just knew it was something...

08:48.049 --> 08:49.210
...beautiful...

08:49.850 --> 08:52.549
...and painful and right.

08:52.850 --> 08:55.240
And I was the only one
who could hear it.

08:57.049 --> 09:00.350
Then I wound up here
and heard Aretha for the first time.

09:01.850 --> 09:03.429
Don't kid yourselves.

09:04.250 --> 09:06.419
Cordy's in a very bad place.

09:08.450 --> 09:10.700
- It's cold.
- What? Put on a sweater.

09:11.450 --> 09:13.799
No, no, no. The hot spot is cold.

09:19.250 --> 09:22.340
Certain geographical areas are rife
with psychic energy.

09:22.850 --> 09:25.899
These areas tend to function
as dimensional hot spots.

09:26.450 --> 09:29.889
Natural gateways between worlds.
Caritas is one such spot.

09:30.649 --> 09:32.750
- The catch is--
- Gotta have one of those.

09:33.649 --> 09:38.039
Creating a portal tends to deplete
the hot spot of its psychic energy.

09:39.049 --> 09:40.559
And since we opened one....

09:40.850 --> 09:43.129
The hot spot is cold.
Can't open the portal.

09:43.850 --> 09:46.129
I was right. It was the batteries.

09:46.850 --> 09:49.549
The same probably applies
to the one in the library.

09:50.450 --> 09:52.799
Why not then wait
till the portal recharges?

09:53.450 --> 09:56.500
No time. We have to find
another hot spot, and fast.

09:57.049 --> 09:58.909
- That's not our only problem.
- Of course not.

09:59.450 --> 10:02.960
When separate entities enter a portal,
they tend to...

10:03.649 --> 10:05.440
...well, separate.

10:06.649 --> 10:09.279
Assuming we find a hot spot
and open a portal...

10:09.649 --> 10:14.250
...if we simply jump in, we could
wind up on opposite ends of the world.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.309
- So Landok and Cordy...
- ...didn't arrive together.

10:20.450 --> 10:21.529
She really is alone.

10:22.850 --> 10:23.860
Hey.

10:24.649 --> 10:27.070
Where have you been?
We spoke hours ago.

10:27.649 --> 10:28.730
I'm sorry.

10:28.850 --> 10:32.500
No, it's okay. It's fine.
You bring him up to date.

10:33.049 --> 10:36.950
Two problems. Finding a dimensional
hot spot and figuring out how--

10:38.450 --> 10:40.200
I'm not going.

10:48.049 --> 10:51.379
- What?
- Last night, I lost one of my crew.

10:52.250 --> 10:53.929
I should've been there.

10:55.250 --> 10:58.019
Sorry, but Wes said the trip
was one-way and I can't.

11:03.049 --> 11:05.149
I know that makes me--

11:05.450 --> 11:07.340
I don't know what it makes me.

11:08.450 --> 11:11.679
But I owed it to you
to tell you face to face.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.129
I wish you luck.

11:22.250 --> 11:24.139
Please, find her.

11:34.850 --> 11:39.100
Tough decision. Poor kid.
But I'm right there with him.

11:40.250 --> 11:41.370
Yeah.

11:42.049 --> 11:43.490
Me, too, I guess.

11:43.850 --> 11:46.799
No, about the "not going" part.
You know I'm not going, right?

11:47.450 --> 11:48.320
What?

11:49.250 --> 11:50.620
It's your world. We need a guide.

11:51.049 --> 11:55.019
When I said I love this dimension
and I'll never, never, never leave...

11:55.850 --> 11:58.480
...which "never" did you
not understand?

11:58.850 --> 12:03.169
- First Gunn, now-- I can't believe it!
- I'm sorry. But I'll tell you what.

12:04.250 --> 12:08.179
I've got an idea about finding
your hot spot. Back in a jiff.

12:15.049 --> 12:16.490
Gunn does have...

12:18.049 --> 12:21.210
...responsibilities. Ties.

12:22.850 --> 12:25.059
- People to take care of.
- So do I.

12:26.450 --> 12:27.429
And right now...

12:27.649 --> 12:31.720
...you and I have to figure out
how to save her.

13:00.330 --> 13:01.309
She's a good cow.

13:01.529 --> 13:05.360
Strong. Maybe a little talkative,
but you can whip it out of her.

13:06.330 --> 13:07.730
Skinny.

13:08.129 --> 13:09.460
Ugly too.

13:09.929 --> 13:11.230
One pig.

13:11.730 --> 13:12.600
Two pigs.

13:12.929 --> 13:15.490
For this old cow?
She'll probably croak soon.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.740
A pig and a pint, then. Flib liquor.

13:20.129 --> 13:22.019
Fine. Put the collar on.

13:23.730 --> 13:27.379
Since the last cow died, we're mucking
out the flehegna stables ourselves.

13:28.529 --> 13:29.759
You should see my rash.

13:38.129 --> 13:40.970
I got it, I got it. Okay.

13:41.129 --> 13:42.360
Okay, look.

13:43.529 --> 13:46.649
First of all,
I am a human being, not a cow.

13:47.129 --> 13:49.730
You can't just barter a human being.

13:50.730 --> 13:54.100
Second of all, one pig?
One measly pig?

13:54.330 --> 13:57.419
Third of all,
there's been a huge misunderstanding.

13:58.529 --> 14:01.129
I am an American and I have rights.

14:01.529 --> 14:03.350
Right now I'd like to get back to--

14:04.529 --> 14:05.470
That hurt!

14:06.330 --> 14:10.899
Cows don't talk. They do their job,
if they know what's good for them.

14:13.529 --> 14:16.860
Come by tomorrow and pick up
your stuff. Come on, cow.

14:17.730 --> 14:21.419
If you think I'll follow you--
You've got another thing--

14:22.529 --> 14:23.929
Ow. Coming.

14:53.129 --> 14:55.799
You don't know where
you're going, You're lost.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.090
Miles from anything that grounds you.

14:59.129 --> 15:01.799
I get a deep sense
of longing, separation.

15:02.129 --> 15:05.009
- Is this a bad time?
- It's like you feel cut off.

15:05.730 --> 15:07.759
- Lorne!
- Aggie! How's it going?

15:08.129 --> 15:11.220
You know the business.
Vague predictions, lengthy pauses.

15:11.730 --> 15:13.590
Anything to keep the numbers rolling.

15:14.730 --> 15:16.980
- Hiding from the mob?
- Don't get me started.

15:17.730 --> 15:22.299
It's Hollywood chic, going incognito,
but this hat's chafing my horns.

15:23.129 --> 15:26.110
- So what brings you here?
- Like you don't already know.

15:26.730 --> 15:29.919
I just want to see what kind of spin
you'll put on it.

15:30.929 --> 15:33.529
Dimensional portals, psychic hot spots.
I need one.

15:33.929 --> 15:36.350
- Why?
- Some friends are going on a trip.

15:36.929 --> 15:40.830
And the big flashing neon warning
light in your aura means what?

15:41.730 --> 15:42.710
Eat at Joe's.

15:44.129 --> 15:46.379
- Can you help me find a hot spot?
- No.

15:48.929 --> 15:51.139
Gotta admit I didn't see that coming.

15:51.929 --> 15:55.860
There's ugly conflict vibes coming
off you, pointing at that portal.

15:56.730 --> 16:00.029
You sure it's not the chili
I had for lunch yesterday?

16:00.330 --> 16:02.259
Talk about conflict!

16:05.730 --> 16:08.779
They need it to go to Pylea,
my home dimension.

16:09.330 --> 16:10.909
You're not going?

16:11.129 --> 16:13.940
Aggie, I'd rather have
a hydrochloric acid facial.

16:15.330 --> 16:17.429
Or a hive of wasps nesting
in my throat.

16:18.330 --> 16:22.049
Or watch a junior high production
of Cats, See where I'm going?

16:22.529 --> 16:24.320
- Not Pylea.
- Exactamundo.

16:24.929 --> 16:28.549
Well, that's too bad.
Now they'll never rescue the girl.

16:29.129 --> 16:30.360
Come again?

16:31.529 --> 16:35.179
I can find your hot spot, but on
one condition. You've gotta go.

16:36.330 --> 16:38.399
It's the only way
you'll ever resolve...

16:38.730 --> 16:41.639
...all these issues clouding up
your aura.

16:43.529 --> 16:44.580
And be honest.

16:45.330 --> 16:49.190
Deep down, you've known you have
to take that one last trip home.

16:51.330 --> 16:52.769
It's the "last" that scares me.

16:53.730 --> 16:57.210
Sometimes the journey's taken
simply because it must be taken.

16:57.929 --> 16:59.610
Is that vague enough?

17:01.529 --> 17:04.900
Is that what I sound like?
No wonder people complain.

17:09.890 --> 17:14.240
I could try a binding spell to fuse us
together as we enter the portal.

17:15.289 --> 17:16.660
Good. Let's do that.

17:17.089 --> 17:21.299
We may emerge on the other side as
a freakishly hybridized Siamese twin.

17:23.690 --> 17:25.130
Keep looking.

17:25.490 --> 17:28.368
This is the third reference
I've seen to iron or metal.

17:31.490 --> 17:33.420
Could be how to keep us
from scattering.

17:33.890 --> 17:35.819
We get handcuffed together?
Who has handcuffs?

17:36.890 --> 17:38.049
Well, I...

17:38.690 --> 17:41.319
...wouldn't know.
But I don't think it'd work.

17:42.289 --> 17:46.640
What will work? It's been 12 hours
since she went through that portal.

17:47.089 --> 17:49.690
- What do you want?
- Angel. Good afternoon.

17:50.690 --> 17:53.359
Lawyers. Don't you people sleep
during the day?

17:55.490 --> 17:58.089
Gavin Park and Mr. Hayes.
We represent Wolfram--

17:58.490 --> 17:59.470
Already bored.

18:02.690 --> 18:05.109
- We've come to appraise the hotel.
- What?

18:06.289 --> 18:10.119
Your lease expires soon, and Wolfram
and Hart may buy this building.

18:11.089 --> 18:15.660
You gotta be kidding. You couldn't
turn me, so now you want to evict me.

18:16.490 --> 18:18.700
They're trying to annoy me to death.

18:21.289 --> 18:23.390
We'd like to walk around,
if you don't mind.

18:24.289 --> 18:25.829
You think I mind?

18:30.890 --> 18:32.049
Very well.

18:32.690 --> 18:35.990
We'll contact your real estate company
about your noncompliance.

18:36.289 --> 18:38.180
They'll send you
a notice of obligation.

18:39.289 --> 18:42.059
After that, if you still
refuse to cooperate...

18:42.289 --> 18:46.750
...I'm sure that, in your lease,
there must be one or two loopholes.

18:55.490 --> 18:57.700
How quick can we get
out of this world?

18:59.930 --> 19:03.509
I want to go home.
I want to be in my bed.

19:04.130 --> 19:06.519
I want to order some Thai food.

19:07.130 --> 19:09.619
I want to read the latest issue
of Marie Claire,

19:10.130 --> 19:14.630
I want to be doing anything
but shoveling demon horse poo!

19:17.329 --> 19:19.289
Woman has ears like a bat.

19:20.329 --> 19:22.500
There's gotta be a way
to get this off.

19:22.730 --> 19:24.380
Don't do that.

19:25.730 --> 19:28.819
Who's there? What do you want?

19:29.329 --> 19:31.750
I forget. It's not important.

19:32.329 --> 19:36.160
If you take your collar off,
bad things will happen to your head.

19:36.529 --> 19:39.230
It'll implode.
So, don't take the collar off.

19:40.130 --> 19:42.619
I can't talk to you
if you don't have a head.

19:43.130 --> 19:44.250
Okay.

19:44.930 --> 19:46.160
Are you a human?

19:46.730 --> 19:49.289
Keep shoveling. Go shovel.

19:50.930 --> 19:51.910
Where'd you come from?

19:52.730 --> 19:55.150
Los Angeles.
How long have you been here?

19:55.730 --> 19:56.960
I was born here.

19:57.529 --> 20:01.220
I mean, not really, I just--
Sometimes I think I was.

20:02.329 --> 20:05.099
I mean, I don't think
it was my thoughts.

20:05.329 --> 20:08.029
I forget certain words.
How'd you get here?

20:08.930 --> 20:10.890
Tell me where "here" is first.

20:11.329 --> 20:13.720
Pylea. Well, keep shoveling! Geez!

20:15.529 --> 20:18.759
Another dimension.
You're lost, I can tell.

20:19.130 --> 20:23.450
So many of us are lost even there,
but it's true. I'm not crazy.

20:24.529 --> 20:26.420
Well, crazy, but I'm not wrong.

20:27.529 --> 20:29.740
So how do I get out of here?

20:32.930 --> 20:36.190
Oh, I forgot laughing.

20:38.930 --> 20:39.980
You don't.

20:40.730 --> 20:43.539
They use you as a slave,
and then your body gives.

20:44.329 --> 20:46.329
Zip. Gone.

20:46.730 --> 20:48.980
Well, that's not happening
to me, okay?

20:49.730 --> 20:52.990
I have friends who are gonna
rescue me any time now.

20:53.930 --> 20:58.430
I tried to get back. I didn't have
the math, which is strange, because--

20:59.329 --> 21:01.890
- How'd you get here?
- I'm pretty sure I....

21:02.329 --> 21:04.789
I was sucked in by a portal.

21:05.930 --> 21:07.680
- A portal?
- Yeah.

21:08.329 --> 21:09.380
Where was it?

21:10.130 --> 21:11.849
- Fugitive!
- Oh, no!

21:14.930 --> 21:16.160
Get her! Get her!

21:16.730 --> 21:19.400
What's going on? What's going on?

21:19.730 --> 21:21.410
On your face, cow. On the floor.

21:22.130 --> 21:23.039
No! No!

21:24.529 --> 21:25.970
Let go of me!

21:32.930 --> 21:35.559
A disabled collar. Clever little cow.

21:37.130 --> 21:39.269
You should've stayed in the woods.

21:40.130 --> 21:41.250
Let go of me!

21:41.329 --> 21:42.450
- Wait--
- Face down!

21:56.890 --> 21:59.940
As soon as Wes solves
our scattering problem, we leave.

22:00.490 --> 22:02.559
Don't know if we'll be coming back.

22:07.089 --> 22:08.599
It's 11:16.

22:08.890 --> 22:11.349
Cordy's been gone
for almost 24 hours now.

22:13.690 --> 22:15.299
I think I've covered everything.

22:16.089 --> 22:20.480
Oh, the mortgage for the hotel
is under the company name.

22:21.490 --> 22:24.329
The lease is up in six months.
That's what they tell me.

22:25.089 --> 22:28.460
So, I guess that's it.
Take care of yourself.

22:35.289 --> 22:36.200
How you holding up?

22:36.490 --> 22:38.980
Waiting for Wes to have
that eureka moment.

22:39.490 --> 22:41.589
- Eureka!
- Oh, geez, thank God.

22:41.890 --> 22:43.990
He actually really says "eureka"?

22:46.089 --> 22:48.160
I know how to get us
through the portal!

22:48.490 --> 22:49.650
Let's go.

22:56.289 --> 23:01.000
Six packets of hefroot, four queeks,
a bottle of flib liquor and a spatula.

23:04.089 --> 23:07.529
Vakma, is it?
Earlier, that girl in the barn--

23:08.289 --> 23:10.539
Shut up, cow.

23:11.289 --> 23:14.869
Trensiduf of the Gathwok Clan
was right. You talk too much.

23:15.490 --> 23:17.140
You're spilling my viper's milk.

23:18.490 --> 23:21.049
I'm sorry.
If I wasn't carrying every....

23:22.089 --> 23:23.099
Oh, no.

23:23.809 --> 23:27.109
Stand up straight.
That milk's worth more than you.

23:29.809 --> 23:31.559
Bad cow! Bad!

23:33.410 --> 23:35.619
A Drokken, it's attacking a villager.

23:36.410 --> 23:39.390
Near the forest, by a big yellow rock.

23:50.569 --> 23:55.029
- No one's gonna ask if I'm okay?
- Cursed! My cow is cursed!

23:55.970 --> 23:57.930
No, wait. It's not a curse!

23:58.690 --> 24:01.990
You have to go save this villager,
or the Drokken will--

24:02.890 --> 24:04.259
Cursed! Cursed!

24:04.690 --> 24:07.039
Cursed! Cursed! Cursed!

24:07.529 --> 24:09.670
Here. Stop here.

24:12.930 --> 24:15.700
Here? Isn't this a movie studio?

24:16.529 --> 24:18.809
Makes a certain kind of sense, no?

24:20.130 --> 24:24.200
This is where Aggie said it was.
And she's never wrong about hot spots.

24:24.930 --> 24:27.980
She was doing SkyBar
way before Brad and Jennifer.

24:28.529 --> 24:29.720
You got the book?

24:30.930 --> 24:32.609
Good. Hold that puppy tight, okay?

24:33.329 --> 24:37.789
I don't want to be stuck over there,
waiting for a mystical locksmith.

24:38.730 --> 24:40.450
All right, then.

24:41.730 --> 24:44.359
I suppose we should probably begin.

24:46.529 --> 24:50.990
Should I, I don't know,
put the top up?

24:51.930 --> 24:56.000
Shouldn't be necessary. If I'm right,
we only require a metal enclosure...

24:56.730 --> 24:59.079
...to insure that we travel together.

24:59.730 --> 25:02.009
The car, top up or down, should do it.

25:03.329 --> 25:05.190
I'm almost positive.

25:08.130 --> 25:09.950
Almost?

25:11.130 --> 25:12.920
Ninety-six percent.

25:15.329 --> 25:18.240
It's not like
I've ever done this before.

25:18.930 --> 25:22.619
- I'm under a great deal of pressure--
- Oh, suck it up, English.

25:26.730 --> 25:28.380
Gunn. How did you--?

25:30.329 --> 25:31.410
Got a phone message.

25:31.529 --> 25:35.079
Sounded like the captain of
the Titanic going down with the ship.

25:38.130 --> 25:41.460
I just thought that
someone on this side should...

25:43.529 --> 25:46.269
...know the details, in case.

25:48.329 --> 25:49.980
A back-up man. Terrific idea.

25:50.130 --> 25:52.970
Now that he's going,
someone should stay, mind the store.

25:53.730 --> 25:57.279
- Don't worry. Get me something nice--
- Shut up.

25:59.730 --> 26:02.079
- Everyone set?
- Let's get a move on.

26:02.730 --> 26:05.539
Right. Here goes.

26:18.930 --> 26:19.799
Cool.

26:20.730 --> 26:23.819
- Ninety-six percent, huh?
- Give or take.

26:26.130 --> 26:27.950
Gentlemen, take a good look.

26:30.930 --> 26:32.470
Now, say goodbye.

26:46.849 --> 26:50.779
The sun! The daylight! Quick, hand me
a blanket, or I'll catch on fire!

26:57.650 --> 27:00.420
- Why am I not on fire?
- Yo, that was phat.

27:01.849 --> 27:04.450
It is another dimension.
Perhaps there's some....

27:04.849 --> 27:07.170
Back up, Copernicus. That's suns.

27:09.049 --> 27:10.210
Plural.

27:11.450 --> 27:13.240
Suns, yes.

27:13.849 --> 27:17.359
Perhaps they don't have
the same effect on vampires.

27:18.049 --> 27:19.730
Watch it, all right?

27:20.450 --> 27:21.430
Hey!

27:22.849 --> 27:23.720
Fascinating!

27:24.049 --> 27:25.869
Y'all see that bendy thing?

27:26.450 --> 27:30.490
- So we made it. This is your world?
- Ah, yes. Home sweet hell.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.690
I'm not on fire.

27:33.049 --> 27:37.259
We're together! And we didn't merge
into a freakish four-man Siamese twin.

27:38.450 --> 27:40.589
That was a risk?
How come nobody told me?

27:40.849 --> 27:43.170
Everybody notice
how much fire I'm not on?

27:43.849 --> 27:47.849
A beautiful day in the neighborhood.
May I suggest we hide the car?

27:49.250 --> 27:52.480
It's a bit conspicuous, seeing
we don't have convertibles here.

27:52.849 --> 27:54.640
Or, you know, cars.

27:55.250 --> 27:57.420
Maybe this is
where Cordy came through.

27:58.250 --> 27:59.160
Could be.

27:59.450 --> 28:02.430
Let's gather branches and brush
to cover up the car.

28:03.049 --> 28:06.910
Look, there's some over in
that patch of sun. I'll get them!

28:14.450 --> 28:18.769
I'll give it to you. Tripping to an
alternate universe? Pretty damn cool.

28:19.250 --> 28:21.640
- But I want to find Cordy quick.
- Me too.

28:22.250 --> 28:24.319
I mean, for her sake, of course.

28:26.450 --> 28:30.099
If I know Pylea, she could probably
use a friend about now.

28:35.730 --> 28:39.980
I'd just like to say that I don't know
anything about a curse, okay?

28:40.529 --> 28:43.160
I just have these visions that--

28:45.329 --> 28:47.049
I don't get them very often.

28:47.730 --> 28:51.140
We found the body by Dester's Rock.
A Drokken beast ate him.

28:51.930 --> 28:53.259
Oh, God, it's you.

28:54.329 --> 28:56.789
I'm really sorry about that, honest.

28:57.329 --> 28:59.400
But I didn't make it happen,
I just saw it.

29:00.329 --> 29:03.380
- Before it had come to pass.
- Exactly.

29:03.930 --> 29:06.630
- It is the curse.
- No, no curse!

29:06.930 --> 29:11.140
Just visions. They're not dangerous.
I use them to help people.

29:11.730 --> 29:12.640
Enough.

29:14.130 --> 29:17.319
We must discover beyond doubt
if she's cursed with the sight.

29:20.730 --> 29:22.410
We will commence the test.

29:26.130 --> 29:28.410
Test? But I haven't studied.

29:30.329 --> 29:33.809
- Not much with the humor, huh?
- Bring the instruments.

29:51.930 --> 29:54.839
Now we shall see
if you are truly cursed.

29:56.130 --> 30:00.099
- I pray you are not.
- Please. I'll keep them to myself.

30:01.529 --> 30:04.650
I'll never mention them again.
Please, no, no! No!

30:09.930 --> 30:12.319
That should do it. You ready?

30:12.930 --> 30:14.089
Yeah.

30:14.730 --> 30:17.539
We're a few miles from town.
We'll have to walk.

30:18.329 --> 30:20.220
No problem walking in the sun.

30:20.730 --> 30:24.769
Yes, we're all heartily aware that
you're not on fire. Shall we go?

30:26.130 --> 30:28.059
Don't forget the book.

30:30.930 --> 30:32.299
What's wrong?

30:33.329 --> 30:34.589
That's not funny.

30:34.529 --> 30:37.299
- I wasn't trying to-- What?
- I don't have the book.

30:38.730 --> 30:40.130
- What?
- You had the book.

30:40.529 --> 30:42.140
- I don't have the book.
- Who had the book?

30:42.329 --> 30:43.309
- Wesley.
- Angel.

30:43.529 --> 30:44.720
- No, I didn't. Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't. Yes, you did.

30:45.329 --> 30:46.269
Whoa, whoa!

30:48.329 --> 30:49.519
Did we look in the car?

30:49.529 --> 30:52.579
I checked it to make sure
we didn't leave anything.

30:53.130 --> 30:54.740
Oh. Like, say, the book!

30:57.329 --> 31:00.140
The book was in the car.
That much we know.

31:00.930 --> 31:04.369
But perhaps its only function is
to open portals to Pylea...

31:05.130 --> 31:08.569
...in which case it'd be useless
in Pylea, and therefore...

31:09.329 --> 31:11.119
...it only exists in our dimension.

31:12.930 --> 31:15.390
Ordinarily, I handle bad news
really well.

31:15.930 --> 31:19.119
I drown my sorrows in a
cold gin and tonic, squeeze of lime.

31:20.130 --> 31:22.690
Except for they don't have them here!

31:23.130 --> 31:27.130
We'll figure out a way to get back.
Right now, we got to find Cordelia.

31:27.930 --> 31:30.279
That's why we're here, right?

31:31.529 --> 31:34.089
She needs us. Let's go.

31:39.329 --> 31:42.099
You grabbed the book from me.
You grabbed it.

31:50.130 --> 31:51.599
The tests are complete.

31:51.930 --> 31:55.299
It is the decision
of the Covenant that the girl...

31:56.130 --> 31:57.920
...is afflicted.

31:57.930 --> 32:00.740
She carries the curse of the sight.

32:18.049 --> 32:21.529
Remember, keep your heads down.
Xenophobia. Kind of a watchword here.

32:22.250 --> 32:25.440
Why are they afraid of Xena?
She's kind of fly.

32:26.450 --> 32:30.950
- "Xenophobia." Fear of foreigners.
- Can we pretend I didn't say that?

32:31.250 --> 32:34.160
Over there is Blix's house,
a boyhood chum of mine.

32:35.450 --> 32:38.289
We were buds.
Always watching out for each other.

32:38.450 --> 32:40.769
Close as a Torto demon
and its parasite.

32:41.450 --> 32:43.839
I'll make the approach.
You stay here.

32:44.450 --> 32:45.319
Why?

32:45.650 --> 32:49.509
We might get beaten to death
with sticks. Be right back.

33:04.849 --> 33:08.920
What? Traitor! Deserter! Betrayer!

33:10.250 --> 33:13.579
- We should run. Now!
- Look, traitor!

33:13.849 --> 33:15.950
Traitor! Stop them!

33:18.049 --> 33:19.210
Traitor!

33:24.650 --> 33:27.950
- Seize them!
- After the traitor!

33:33.049 --> 33:34.730
What now? Where do we go?

33:35.450 --> 33:38.890
Probably the nearest dungeon.
We're surrounded.

33:48.809 --> 33:52.809
We've been through a lot together.
We've faced some steep odds.

33:53.769 --> 33:56.609
I got the 20 on the left,
you take the 50 on the right.

34:20.650 --> 34:22.860
I think we're winning!

34:41.610 --> 34:45.469
- Krevlornswath of the Deathwok Clan.
- Constable Narwek.

34:46.409 --> 34:48.829
Lovely to see you again.
How are you?

34:49.409 --> 34:53.659
Krevlornswath of the Deathwok Clan
you have returned. Why?

34:54.210 --> 34:56.739
I've been asking myself
the same question.

34:57.210 --> 35:00.829
Who are these cow scum?
You are all dressed very strangely.

35:02.010 --> 35:04.639
They're humans.
And they're my friends.

35:05.010 --> 35:06.659
Cows are not friends.

35:07.409 --> 35:10.820
They are creatures of labor,
beasts of burden, no more.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.860
I don't know where you've been...

35:14.610 --> 35:18.369
...but clearly you have abandoned
the teachings of your people.

35:21.210 --> 35:23.980
Take him. We'll begin
interrogations immediately.

35:24.809 --> 35:27.650
- You can't do this.
- Watch it. Easy.

35:28.409 --> 35:30.619
You dare use your tongue
in my presence?

35:33.809 --> 35:34.789
Unworthy trash.

35:44.610 --> 35:48.230
For the crime of assault
against your betters...

35:48.809 --> 35:52.320
...you are to be detained
until our Highness passes sentence.

35:53.010 --> 35:55.039
I'm guessing community service is out.

36:03.809 --> 36:05.489
It's too bad.

36:06.809 --> 36:08.769
I really like those orange vests.

36:09.809 --> 36:11.110
Gunn, stop.

36:20.010 --> 36:21.900
Put these things away.

36:30.210 --> 36:32.769
The time has arrived, my brethren.

36:34.409 --> 36:38.340
She is cursed with sight.
Measures must be taken.

36:39.210 --> 36:40.510
Blood must be spilled.

36:48.809 --> 36:52.250
It's no use.
Thing's made out of a magical alloy.

36:53.010 --> 36:55.039
Really? How can you tell?

36:55.409 --> 36:57.730
I can't.
I'm making myself feel better.

37:02.010 --> 37:03.690
You found anything yet?

37:04.409 --> 37:07.250
Sealed up tight.
Six, seven inches thick. You?

37:08.010 --> 37:11.309
No. No, these impenetrable
stone walls--

37:12.210 --> 37:14.980
You say impenetrable,
and I will kick your ass.

37:17.610 --> 37:20.170
I was always horrified
by the Tower of London.

37:21.210 --> 37:22.610
It wasn't that bad.

37:24.210 --> 37:25.440
Yes?

37:26.010 --> 37:27.199
Well....

37:27.809 --> 37:31.880
Compared to this place,
I'm sure it takes on a nostalgic glow.

37:33.210 --> 37:34.860
I wonder if the host's okay.

37:35.010 --> 37:38.909
I'm sure "interrogation" just
means some wrist-slapping.

37:39.809 --> 37:41.460
- That, or he's dead.
- Shut up.

37:42.210 --> 37:45.159
- It may not be wrist-slapping.
- No. Shut up.

37:53.010 --> 37:54.730
How we supposed to hear any--

37:56.010 --> 37:58.150
I hear two men talking in the hall.

37:59.610 --> 38:02.239
- Vampire.
- Talking about a girl with visions.

38:03.210 --> 38:05.769
A Covenant. A curse.

38:06.210 --> 38:08.840
Something about testing
the girl for sight.

38:11.610 --> 38:13.500
He said she screamed.

38:14.010 --> 38:15.730
Those bastards!

38:17.610 --> 38:19.639
They're taking us to a castle.

38:23.010 --> 38:24.730
We're gonna be sentenced.

38:27.809 --> 38:29.349
They're coming.

38:36.809 --> 38:38.489
Out, prisoners.

38:48.210 --> 38:49.369
Be ready.

38:56.849 --> 39:01.349
Oh, am I glad to see you. You're
so much less dead than I expected.

39:02.250 --> 39:05.900
- What did they do to you?
- First there was the parade.

39:07.050 --> 39:11.550
Ticker tape, streamers. Honestly,
I was so touched I almost wept.

39:12.449 --> 39:16.420
Locked me up, pushed me around,
asked a bunch of questions.

39:17.250 --> 39:19.500
- We have a lead on Cordy.
- You found her?

39:22.650 --> 39:26.340
No. We heard two guys talk
about a girl with visions.

39:27.449 --> 39:30.750
- Yikes. I don't like that.
- They mentioned a Covenant.

39:31.650 --> 39:35.550
- Something about tests.
- We need to get out of here.

39:36.449 --> 39:37.849
Silence!

39:38.250 --> 39:42.289
Krevlornswath of the Deathwok Clan,
you and the cows are not to speak.

39:43.050 --> 39:46.769
- De-bunch your panties, Narwek.
- You are a traitor.

39:47.250 --> 39:49.599
You abandoned your life-giver,
betrayed us...

39:50.250 --> 39:53.829
...and now you consort
with these animals.

39:57.449 --> 40:01.800
I will take great pleasure
in watching them kill you slowly.

40:05.849 --> 40:09.039
Do we go in separately or together?
We don't have time.

40:09.449 --> 40:12.289
I've never been sentenced
to death before. Together?

40:13.050 --> 40:14.630
- Listen up.
- After that...

40:14.849 --> 40:18.260
...we'll hang their corpses
in the village square.

40:19.050 --> 40:20.559
Prisoners!

40:22.050 --> 40:26.650
The day of judgement has arrived.
The venerable monarch of Pylea...

40:27.449 --> 40:31.309
...general of the ravenous legions,
eater of enemy flesh...

40:32.250 --> 40:35.969
...prelate of the blood rites
and sovereign of death...

40:36.449 --> 40:39.539
...is prepared to pass sentence
upon you.

40:41.849 --> 40:43.010
One...

40:43.050 --> 40:44.840
Open the doors.

40:46.050 --> 40:47.170
...two....

40:57.449 --> 40:58.820
Hi, guys.

41:38.250 --> 41:40.139
Thank you, thank you very much,
