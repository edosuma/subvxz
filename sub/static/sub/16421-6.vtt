00:04.546 --> 00:06.881
[Mullins] Attention students,
this is Principal Mullins.

00:07.382 --> 00:10.385
Staircases at school will henceforth
be replaced with water slides.

00:11.052 --> 00:12.387
[gasping]

00:12.470 --> 00:13.847
Awesome!

00:14.055 --> 00:15.557
I'm going to bring my pool noodle.

00:16.099 --> 00:19.019
-Gotcha.
-Lawrence?

00:20.020 --> 00:22.063
Oh, that's one of those...

00:22.772 --> 00:24.065
What is that?

00:24.399 --> 00:25.775
[in woman's voice] It's my new invention.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.695
[normal voice]
Oops. It's my new invention.

00:28.778 --> 00:31.281
The voice modulator 9000.

00:31.948 --> 00:33.825
It can make you sound like anyone
you want.

00:33.950 --> 00:37.996
I've programmed in Principal Mullins'
voice and a few others.

00:38.329 --> 00:39.456
So cool.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.416
So, no pool noodle?

00:44.711 --> 00:46.504
[Tomika's voice]
Freddy's a way better skater than me,

00:46.629 --> 00:48.089
I could never shred like him.

00:48.381 --> 00:49.716
Yes, I can; shut up.

00:49.799 --> 00:50.884
Make me.

00:51.092 --> 00:53.219
Yeah, well maybe I will, Tomika.

00:54.512 --> 00:55.597
Wait.

00:56.598 --> 01:00.351
Hey dudes and dudettes,
I wrote a song about Halloween.

01:00.977 --> 01:04.939
The chords are F sharp, D, A,
and E, got it?

01:05.023 --> 01:06.066
All right.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.734
[music playing]

01:07.942 --> 01:10.862
That's it.
L-Train, give me some spooky organ.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.907
-[spooky organ playing]
-Nice.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.326
That's it, let's rock.

01:16.409 --> 01:20.455

And as you can tell by that song
I am super pumped for Halloween tomorrow.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.639
Halloween, that's happening.

02:19.889 --> 02:23.268
My mom's been working
on my Jack Black costume for weeks.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.022
She doesn't really know
what he looks like.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.817
What are you going to wear, Zack?

02:31.234 --> 02:32.318
This.

02:32.527 --> 02:36.281
That's a terrible costume.
Unless your costume is boring guy

02:36.364 --> 02:39.033
who doesn't know how awesome Halloween is.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.452
In which case it's genius.

02:43.329 --> 02:46.833
Unfortunately, Principal Mullins banned
Halloween at Travis Prep.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.001
What?

02:48.209 --> 02:51.629
You can't ban Halloween.
Halloween is like rock and roll.

02:51.713 --> 02:55.133
It belongs to the people.
And there's candy!

02:56.342 --> 02:58.344
We'd love to celebrate Halloween,

02:58.428 --> 03:01.347
but all we get is the stupid
fall harvest festival.

03:01.431 --> 03:02.765
The highlights are a speech

03:02.849 --> 03:05.518
from Principal Mullins
and a contest for best gourd.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.106
The prize is a pizza party
which Clark's class always wins.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.150
The worst part is he can't even
eat cheese!

03:12.317 --> 03:14.861
He just rings the grease into his mouth.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.489
You can't just give up on Halloween.

03:18.698 --> 03:19.866
You're kids.

03:20.074 --> 03:21.576
It's your sacred duty to dress up

03:21.659 --> 03:23.828
and stuff your face with candy until
you puke.

03:24.037 --> 03:28.791
[sighing] Barfing up candy corn
is just a sweet, sweet dream, Mr. Finn.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.712
Do not give in to authority.

03:33.004 --> 03:36.883
Some very wise men called
the Beastie Boys once said,

03:36.966 --> 03:40.345
"You've got to fight for your right
to party."

03:40.428 --> 03:42.430
And by party, they meant Trick or Treat.

03:42.597 --> 03:46.351
Would it kill you
to reference Katy Perry just once?

03:47.185 --> 03:48.186
Yes!

03:50.021 --> 03:53.775
What I'm trying to say
is you've gotta enjoy it while it lasts.

03:53.858 --> 03:56.361
'Cause you get to a certain age
where going house to house

03:56.444 --> 04:03.117
and asking for candy is creepy
or inappropriate or it's not Halloween.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.581
Put your back into it, men.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.709
Do you think they hand out pizza parties
for splotchy squash?

04:13.253 --> 04:16.714
Hey Freddy, are you ready to lose your
third harvest festival in a row?

04:16.881 --> 04:19.968
No one cares about the stupid
harvest festival but you, Clark.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.844
Everyone else likes Halloween.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.388
Face it, hairdo.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.725
As long as Principal Mullins is in charge
there'll be no Halloween here.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.227
[sneezing]

04:29.769 --> 04:31.980
Ma'am, you're obviously sick,
you need to go home.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.273
Yes. I'm sick.

04:33.356 --> 04:36.025
Sick of you hovering,
Vice Principal Sternhagen.

04:36.192 --> 04:38.695
I've never taken a sick day
and I'm not going to start

04:38.778 --> 04:40.446
the day before my harvest festival speech.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.699
Oh, oh, oh. [sneezing]

04:43.324 --> 04:45.410
You know, if your mucus is green,

04:45.493 --> 04:47.078
you should seek medical attention
immediately.

04:47.203 --> 04:48.204
According to whom?

04:48.288 --> 04:50.581
According
to the "What colour is your snot?" chart.

04:51.374 --> 04:56.254
I have never felt better in all my...
[sighing] Oh. [sneezing]

04:58.047 --> 04:59.424
Yup, it's green.

04:59.882 --> 05:01.843
Ugh, that came out of me?

05:02.343 --> 05:04.053
Oh, fine, fine, I'll go home.

05:04.429 --> 05:07.015
Mr. Sternhagen, wipe your face,
you look disgusting.

05:07.807 --> 05:11.644
As acting principal, I'll keep a firm grip
on discipline while you're gone.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.271
You're 12, Clark.

05:13.771 --> 05:15.898
Mr. Sternhagen will be acting principal.

05:16.065 --> 05:18.776
Yes! In your face, Clark!

05:19.027 --> 05:21.612
[sighing] Keep it together,
Arnold, this is not a drill.

05:21.696 --> 05:26.034

06:08.910 --> 06:11.954
You heard what Mr. Finn said.
Every kid deserves a Halloween.

06:12.830 --> 06:14.123
[Lawrence's voice] I say we go for it.

06:14.749 --> 06:18.086
Mm, now that I hear myself say it
I'm on board.

06:27.011 --> 06:29.764
[phone ringing]

06:30.098 --> 06:32.058
Acting Principal Sternhagen,
how may I help you?

06:32.391 --> 06:33.893
[Mullins' voice]
This is Principal Mullins.

06:33.976 --> 06:35.561
Oh, hello ma'am.

06:35.645 --> 06:38.439
I was just busy breaking
children's spirits.

06:39.148 --> 06:40.441
[normal voice] My turn.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.360
[Mullins' voice]
Cancel the harvest festival.

06:42.443 --> 06:44.987
Instead, tomorrow the school will
celebrate Halloween.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.740
I want spooky decorations
and all the kids trick or treating.

06:47.824 --> 06:48.866
But I thought you--

06:48.950 --> 06:52.203
No buts, and no more best gourd contests.

06:52.370 --> 06:56.124
Now it's scariest Halloween contest.
Winning class gets the pizza party.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.416
I thought you hated Halloween.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.545
Just do as I say. Now, hop on one foot.

07:03.005 --> 07:04.715
And say "boing" every time you hop.

07:05.424 --> 07:09.137
Boing, boing, boing, boing,
boing, boing, boing.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.763
Now quit messing around and get back
to work.

07:15.393 --> 07:18.062
-You think he bought it?
-[normal voice] Wait for it.

07:19.105 --> 07:22.525
[Sternhagen] Attention students,
the fall harvest festival is cancelled.

07:22.608 --> 07:26.195
Tomorrow, Travis Prep will officially
celebrate Halloween.

07:26.404 --> 07:29.365
-Yes!
-[cheering]

07:29.574 --> 07:32.702
You think Mr. Finn would be okay
if he knew we tricked Sternhagen?

07:32.785 --> 07:36.038
Halloween!

07:36.831 --> 07:38.207
I think he'd be okay.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.839
I can't believe we're actually going
to have Halloween at school.

07:44.922 --> 07:49.010
I know, it's like Christmas came early
in the form of Halloween.

07:50.052 --> 07:51.220
Well, well.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.388
What do you want, Clark?

07:52.638 --> 07:56.017
Let me finish. Well.

07:56.684 --> 08:00.354
I cant wait to beat you and feast
on all that pizza and glory.

08:00.605 --> 08:05.151
Even though he's lactose intolerant
and cheese gives him diarrhea. Boom!

08:07.320 --> 08:08.946
Shut it, Holden.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.116
[sighing] Our zombie walk is going
to be epic.

08:12.325 --> 08:16.329
Well, our class is building a super scary
haunted house.

08:16.412 --> 08:19.540
Yeah, it's going to kick your
zombie walk's undead butt.

08:20.625 --> 08:25.046
Your haunted house is going to stink worse
than Clark's bathroom after yogurt night.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.842
You're uninvited to yogurt night.

08:34.013 --> 08:37.391
Come on, people, we can do this.
Tomika, you're on guts and maggots.

08:37.475 --> 08:40.353
Zack, blood curdling screams.
Lawrence, rotting corpses.

08:40.436 --> 08:43.272
And, Freddy... Cupcakes.

08:46.609 --> 08:48.736
This thing looks sick.

08:49.111 --> 08:51.489
But is it good enough
to beat Clark's class?

08:51.572 --> 08:52.657
It will be.

08:52.865 --> 08:56.702
Because Tomika's got
the most spine-tingling finish

08:56.786 --> 08:58.412
in Halloween history.

08:58.746 --> 08:59.747
The spider drop.

09:00.373 --> 09:04.919
True. I did it at home last year
and my grandma's still scared to hug me.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.505
Hello pizza party.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.219
Only one candy per trick or treater.

09:13.469 --> 09:19.475
Yes, but I'm famous TV and film star
Jack Black. Skidoosh.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.352
One.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.439
I don't know, Lawrence, it looks scary.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.817
Nothing to worry about, snuggle bunny,

09:27.900 --> 09:30.987
we just want to see how well it works
on a fresh victim.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.823
I probably shouldn't have said victim.

09:34.824 --> 09:37.577
Okay, I'll help but I don't want
to go in alone.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.120
Where have you been?

09:39.704 --> 09:41.330
Gettin' my treats on.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.959
Pro tip: avoid Mr. Yoland's class,
he's giving out free toothbrushes.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.461
What am I supposed to do with that?

09:47.920 --> 09:49.755
Mr. Finn, would you be so kind as

09:49.839 --> 09:53.301
to accompany m'lady on her walk through
our haunted house?

09:53.426 --> 09:56.345
Me? Go in there?

09:57.722 --> 10:01.559
As a modern dude who's a big
believer in girl power,

10:01.642 --> 10:05.396
I would never want
to discourage this strong, confident,

10:05.730 --> 10:08.983
young woman from forging her own path.

10:10.067 --> 10:13.821
Thanks, but I scare easy.
I'd feel better if you went in with me.

10:14.488 --> 10:15.531
Great.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.454
-[screeching]
-[screaming]

10:21.537 --> 10:22.580
Bats!

10:23.289 --> 10:25.458
It's okay, Mr. Finn, they're not real.

10:25.541 --> 10:28.919
[screaming] Fake bats!

10:31.213 --> 10:33.549

10:33.799 --> 10:39.138
Bob for an apple, my dearies? [laughing]

10:39.221 --> 10:42.058
Uh, you go for it, Mr. Finn.

10:42.141 --> 10:45.478
Nice try. I'm going to stick my face
in there and something creepy

10:45.561 --> 10:48.773
is going to pop out and scare me.
Well, Summer, sorry.

10:48.856 --> 10:51.484
Nothing's going to scare-- Ah!

10:51.567 --> 10:53.319
[laughing]

10:56.947 --> 10:58.115
Die, earthling!

10:58.199 --> 10:59.950
Take her, not me.

11:01.619 --> 11:05.122
I didn't mean it, Esme,
I would never let anything happen to you.

11:06.123 --> 11:07.291
[hissing]

11:07.375 --> 11:09.251
Take her, not me!

11:10.252 --> 11:12.171
Again, my bad.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.926
You can see the light through the cobwebs.

11:17.843 --> 11:21.138
Oh. Thank goodness, it's finally over.

11:21.222 --> 11:22.264
[hissing]

11:22.348 --> 11:25.393
[screaming]

11:26.852 --> 11:29.146
That spider was the size of a vehicle.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.191
Whoa, you were really scared, Mr. Finn.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.401
Wha, who me?

11:33.526 --> 11:37.238
Pfft, it was too dark in there
to see which one of us was screaming.

11:38.155 --> 11:39.240
It was him.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.827
Tomika, love the spider drop at the end.

11:42.910 --> 11:45.079
I didn't see it coming.
You guys did a great job.

11:45.162 --> 11:46.247
[all] Thanks.

11:46.414 --> 11:47.623
I'm going to go spread the word.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.709
There is no way we can't win.

11:50.835 --> 11:54.004
She's right. There's nothing scarier
than our haunted house.

11:54.171 --> 11:57.049
[thunder crashing]

11:57.425 --> 12:02.721
[screaming]

12:02.972 --> 12:04.723
Why are you guys screaming?

12:04.932 --> 12:06.183
We tricked Sternhagen.

12:06.308 --> 12:08.519
Principal Mullins never really approved
Halloween.

12:09.645 --> 12:11.439
[thunder crashing]

12:11.772 --> 12:16.485
[screaming]

12:20.781 --> 12:23.868
Why didn't you guys tell me you faked
Principal Mullins approving Halloween?

12:24.076 --> 12:25.536
We were just doing what you told us to.

12:25.619 --> 12:27.788
You said we had to fight
for our right to trick or treat.

12:27.913 --> 12:30.499
Oh, that does sound like something
I would say.

12:30.791 --> 12:34.253
Why am I so darn inspirational?
She's going to kill me.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.464
Mr. Finn?

12:36.881 --> 12:40.676
You never told me you had such a handsome
twin brother.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.265
We may be okay.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.310
Principal Mullins,
shouldn't you be home in bed?

12:49.477 --> 12:52.980
Oh, I took some very strong cold medicine
so I could do my speech,

12:53.063 --> 12:57.234
and usually it makes me a little loopy,
but I feel just fine now, Tomika.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.362
I'm Freddy.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.448
If you say so, Tomika.

13:05.534 --> 13:10.289
We need to get her out of here before
she notices... everything.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.875
♪ Looks like a white winged dove ♪

13:12.958 --> 13:15.211
♪ Sings a song sounds like she's singing ♪

13:15.586 --> 13:18.923
♪ Ooh, baby, ooh, ooh ♪ [humming]

13:19.006 --> 13:21.884
She may have taken too much cold medicine.

13:22.426 --> 13:24.011
[humming]

13:24.470 --> 13:27.515
She definitely took
too much cold medicine.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.268
[gasping]

13:31.393 --> 13:33.687
I could swear I just saw a wolf man.

13:33.771 --> 13:36.190
No, that was Glen, he's just Canadian.

13:36.273 --> 13:38.442
All right, right, of course.

13:38.859 --> 13:41.070
Why don't you rest up a while,
Principal M.

13:43.906 --> 13:46.867
Listen guys, just now, we got lucky.

13:47.034 --> 13:50.871
But when Principal Mullins' cold medicine
wears off we're all going to be busted.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.040
But we're this close to beating Clark.

13:53.123 --> 13:54.124
And winning the pizza party.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.501
And having a real Halloween.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.044
And beating Clark.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.838
I'm competitive.

14:00.839 --> 14:03.676
Look, we could race to take all the
decorations down

14:03.759 --> 14:05.135
and pretend like this never happened,

14:05.553 --> 14:09.265
or we can really go for it
and keep Mullins busy enough

14:09.348 --> 14:11.684
to have the greatest Halloween
of all time!

14:11.767 --> 14:12.851
What do you guys say?

14:12.935 --> 14:14.270
[All] Yeah!

14:14.353 --> 14:15.437
How do we do that, Mr. Finn?

14:15.646 --> 14:16.814
No idea.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.901
I'm a big picture guy. Summer?

14:22.152 --> 14:26.282
Principal Mullins wants to give a speech,
so let her.

14:26.407 --> 14:30.202
Your Earth logic does not compute.
Bleep blorp.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.288
We fake an assembly.

14:32.454 --> 14:34.540
Mullins can give her speech
in the auditorium.

14:34.748 --> 14:37.918
Yeah, while everybody else keeps secretly
celebrating Halloween.

14:38.419 --> 14:40.963
If the whole school
is celebrating Halloween,

14:41.380 --> 14:43.340
then who is she giving the speech to?

14:46.176 --> 14:47.428
You think this will really fool her?

14:47.636 --> 14:48.637
Hit the lights, Zack.

14:48.721 --> 14:49.847
Got it!

14:53.642 --> 14:56.520
Whoa, it looks like a real audience
from up here.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.814
Skinny but real.

14:59.523 --> 15:01.942
Add some sound effects and we're golden.

15:02.192 --> 15:06.614
[crowd] Lawrence, Lawrence,
Lawrence, Lawrence!

15:06.989 --> 15:08.032
Oops, wrong button.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.950
That's what I play when I work out.

15:10.951 --> 15:14.038
Oh, I can't see a thing.
This is the perfect--

15:14.121 --> 15:16.248
-[screaming]
-[thudding]

15:17.541 --> 15:18.626
I'm okay!

15:21.629 --> 15:23.005
He's not.

15:24.214 --> 15:25.841
Okay, Tomika, all set.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.427
Just get Principal Mullins to the stage
and get back to the haunted house

15:28.510 --> 15:29.595
as fast as you can.

15:29.845 --> 15:31.388
We can't win the contest without you.

15:31.805 --> 15:34.224
Got it, over and... [screaming]

15:34.558 --> 15:35.601
[sighing]

15:35.726 --> 15:37.519
Hello, Principal Mullins.

15:37.686 --> 15:40.522
Who's excited for the fall harvest speech?

15:40.731 --> 15:43.525
This girl, that's why I was screaming.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.028
Let me just fix you up a little bit.

15:46.570 --> 15:49.365
Here you go, there's a pretty principal.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.911
Now let's just put this special cold
and flu bag over your head.

15:56.330 --> 15:59.833
Ah, this just feels like a regular
shopping bag.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.710
Oh no, it's prescription.

16:02.169 --> 16:03.671
That makes sense.

16:06.882 --> 16:10.344
Oh. [gasping] [sighing]

16:10.511 --> 16:12.888
It's a packed house, knock 'em dead,
ma'am.

16:13.180 --> 16:17.101
You're not going anywhere, young lady,
I need a helper to wave the corn husks.

16:17.184 --> 16:18.185
I really can't, I--

16:18.268 --> 16:20.396
That's fine, I'll just get someone out
of the audience.

16:20.479 --> 16:21.563
No!

16:22.356 --> 16:23.899
Husk me, woman!

16:26.360 --> 16:29.363
[Man] Students of William B. Travis Prep,

16:29.446 --> 16:34.660
please welcome
your Principal Rosa Lee Mullins!

16:34.743 --> 16:39.790
[applauding]

16:40.040 --> 16:46.171
Solemn as the corn husks waving
in autumn's amber.

16:47.631 --> 16:48.841
Wave the husks.

16:56.765 --> 17:03.772
[music playing]

17:03.856 --> 17:10.863
[music playing]

17:10.946 --> 17:17.953
[music playing]

17:18.037 --> 17:25.044
[music playing]

17:25.127 --> 17:27.671
[music playing]

17:27.796 --> 17:29.465
[applauding]

17:29.548 --> 17:32.509
Now this is what I call a top-notch
Halloween spectacle.

17:32.634 --> 17:33.886
So we're winning the pizza party?

17:34.011 --> 17:36.388
Well, it wouldn't be fair
to say until I've judged the last class.

17:36.513 --> 17:38.015
[growling]

17:38.098 --> 17:39.141
But yes.

17:42.478 --> 17:44.646
He's planning
to give Clark the pizza party.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.106
We've got to get Tomika back.

17:46.273 --> 17:49.234
There's no time.
We may as well face it, it's over.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.403
Not yet, I have a plan.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.282
Will someone please walk in front of me?

17:58.702 --> 18:01.830
And the wind blows the leaves through--

18:01.914 --> 18:04.249
-[cheering]
-Wow, what a finish.

18:04.333 --> 18:07.294
-I wasn't--
-Oh look, the crowd's going wild.

18:10.964 --> 18:13.592
[laughing] Thank you!

18:13.675 --> 18:14.760
You're so kind.

18:16.512 --> 18:20.057
[laughing]

18:22.851 --> 18:25.270
I'll make sure Principal Mullins gets
to her car, just run,

18:25.354 --> 18:27.189
-you might still get there in time.
-Okay.

18:28.649 --> 18:33.028
All right, I just saw perfection,
so you're going to have to dazzle me.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.321
Right this way.

18:35.781 --> 18:40.744
If you dare! [laughing]

18:43.914 --> 18:46.166
[screeching]

18:46.250 --> 18:50.337
Yikes, bats on strings.
My house has real bats, but nice try.

18:54.967 --> 18:59.596
Bob for apples, my dear? [cackling]

18:59.721 --> 19:02.432
No thanks, and you should get
that cackle checked by a doctor.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.563
[screaming]

19:10.649 --> 19:12.151
Bye, earthling.

19:12.317 --> 19:16.238
Ugh, I see they don't use breath mints
on planet boring.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.743
[hissing]

19:21.869 --> 19:25.706
Oh, brooding teen vampire.
My poodle's got scarier fangs.

19:33.338 --> 19:36.717
Oh fantastic,
an empty space where nothing happens.

19:37.217 --> 19:38.302
Amateur hour.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.180
[screaming]

19:42.639 --> 19:44.141
I'm a spider.

19:45.642 --> 19:46.768
Out of my way.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.610
[screaming]

19:57.321 --> 20:02.492
-Spider!
-[screaming]

20:02.993 --> 20:05.162
Gotcha. You've been spidered.

20:06.205 --> 20:09.458
Well, I vowed to give the pizza party
to the class that scared me the most,

20:10.000 --> 20:13.086
and since I just soiled my tunic
Mr. Finn's class wins.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.546
[All] Yeah!

20:14.630 --> 20:17.007
[laughing]

20:17.174 --> 20:20.260
So awesome. But we worked really hard
at being zombies.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.553
Holden even bit a guy.

20:21.887 --> 20:24.264
We deserve that pizza, not these losers.

20:24.431 --> 20:25.515
Losers?

20:25.766 --> 20:27.059
Eat my web.

20:27.267 --> 20:29.394
[gasping]

20:29.519 --> 20:33.440
What in the name
of William B. Travis is going on here?

20:33.523 --> 20:35.651
Principal Mullins,
but I saw you drive away.

20:35.734 --> 20:39.404
Well I forgot my cold and flu bag,
I can't drive home without that.

20:39.488 --> 20:40.864
Look, Principal Mullins,

20:40.948 --> 20:42.950
the kids just wanted
to celebrate Halloween.

20:43.116 --> 20:45.535
You are on very thin ice, Mr. Finn.

20:45.702 --> 20:49.873
Um, you must be mistaken,
'cause I'm famous actor...

20:50.749 --> 20:52.876
[humming]

20:53.168 --> 20:54.253
Jack Black.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.797
[phone ringing]

20:57.714 --> 20:59.841
[gasping] What?

21:00.175 --> 21:03.345
[Man] That's an odd way to greet
the President of the school board.

21:03.428 --> 21:06.598
Oh, Mr. Kincade, what an honour.

21:07.140 --> 21:08.308
[Kincade's voice] Yes, it is.

21:08.517 --> 21:12.145
I'm calling because I heard there was
a Halloween celebration at your school.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.481
Yeah, I was just trying to get
to the bottom of--

21:14.731 --> 21:16.900
And I wanted to commend the person
who thought of it.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.152
I hear it was a huge success.

21:20.237 --> 21:22.281
Success. Ah.

21:22.364 --> 21:24.866
That would be me, all my idea.

21:25.742 --> 21:29.037
Now, I want next year's Halloween event
to be even better.

21:29.204 --> 21:33.333
[Mullins] Whatever you say, Mr. Kincade.
Or can I call you Charles?

21:33.417 --> 21:34.543
You can't.

21:38.839 --> 21:41.466
This is the best Halloween ever!

21:41.883 --> 21:43.343
-Totally.
-It rocks.

21:43.552 --> 21:44.886
Bleep blorp.

21:44.970 --> 21:49.725
I never thought there'd be anything better
than Halloween candy, but Halloween pizza,

21:49.808 --> 21:50.976
I love you.

21:51.727 --> 21:52.894
Trick or treat!

21:52.978 --> 21:54.438
[screaming]

21:56.106 --> 21:58.483
-Happy Halloween, guys.
-Happy Halloween.

22:01.486 --> 22:08.493
[music playing]
