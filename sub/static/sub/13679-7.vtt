00:03.637 --> 00:05.725
Previously on American Gothic...

00:05.753 --> 00:07.219
Alison's weeks from the election...

00:07.239 --> 00:09.191
- Jenny Windham, Channel 12.
- The police have just linked

00:09.206 --> 00:10.658
the DNA of the Silver Bells Killer

00:10.678 --> 00:12.315
to a member of your immediate family.

00:12.435 --> 00:13.412
... and Cam is sober.

00:13.428 --> 00:15.110
My sobriety starts over today.

00:15.329 --> 00:16.686
No one wants to think

00:16.706 --> 00:18.097
their child is troubled.

00:18.100 --> 00:20.785
This one got strangled,
like what Silver Bells does.

00:20.802 --> 00:22.435
He needs help. Now.

00:22.602 --> 00:24.599
Alison told me every detail.

00:24.604 --> 00:26.571
- Why would she...
- That's part of our arrangement.

00:26.591 --> 00:28.975
I'm sorry if you thought
it was more than that.

00:29.389 --> 00:31.611
Christina, my name is
Detective Brady Ross.

00:31.613 --> 00:33.561
Garrett Hawthorne is a suspect

00:33.593 --> 00:35.748
- in the Silver Bells murders.
- Hey.

00:37.828 --> 00:41.321
The blood on the belt is a
match for Mitchell Hawthorne.

00:41.355 --> 00:42.552
It was Dad.

00:48.353 --> 00:50.281
He came to my clinic a few weeks ago.

00:50.301 --> 00:52.854
He cut his hand and needed some stitches.

00:52.904 --> 00:55.466
I saw him again a few nights later.

00:55.777 --> 00:57.979
Uh... He must've been...

00:58.004 --> 01:00.521
I don't know, he must've been stalking me.

01:01.387 --> 01:03.730
We started spending time together,

01:03.895 --> 01:05.767
and he took me to the woods.

01:06.878 --> 01:08.535
Was it him?

01:09.206 --> 01:10.757
No, it was his father.

01:24.946 --> 01:26.909
The drugs should be wearing off.

01:33.431 --> 01:35.453
Am I okay, Doc?

01:36.622 --> 01:38.010
I'm, uh...

01:38.858 --> 01:40.458
I'm not a doctor.

01:42.451 --> 01:44.395
We have a few questions.

01:45.999 --> 01:47.865
After 17 years,

01:47.867 --> 01:50.183
Boston finally has some answers.

01:50.303 --> 01:52.441
We now have irrefutable evidence

01:52.451 --> 01:55.706
tying deceased Hawthorne
Concrete CEO Mitchell Hawthorne

01:55.708 --> 01:57.411
to the Silver Bells murders.

01:58.467 --> 02:02.023
The killings, which
began on June 22, 1999,

02:02.023 --> 02:04.959
haunted the city for the next three years.

02:05.318 --> 02:07.857
17 years ago the city was rocked...

02:07.867 --> 02:08.719
Your turn.

02:08.721 --> 02:10.420
... by a series of murders
that left its citizens

02:10.423 --> 02:12.438
with too many unanswered questions.

02:12.988 --> 02:15.025
Tell us what you told the police.

02:19.604 --> 02:21.106
14 years ago,

02:21.756 --> 02:24.429
I found a few things in Dad's stuff.

02:25.190 --> 02:26.376
Rope,

02:26.917 --> 02:27.808
belts.

02:27.928 --> 02:30.274
They looked just like
what I'd seen on the news.

02:30.276 --> 02:33.416
- And you didn't tell the police?
- Would you believe it?

02:34.885 --> 02:37.184
Any of you, if you saw it,
would it make sense to you?

02:37.696 --> 02:40.687
I thought there must be some
kind of explanation, right?

02:40.715 --> 02:43.846
But the next day, David Morales
was killed by Silver Bells.

02:45.158 --> 02:47.181
So I confronted Dad about it,

02:48.218 --> 02:49.352
and he blew up.

02:49.812 --> 02:51.328
The more he yelled,

02:51.557 --> 02:53.230
the more defensive he got,

02:53.232 --> 02:55.526
the more I began to suspect that...

02:56.407 --> 02:57.604
it was him.

03:02.842 --> 03:04.475
But before I left,

03:04.770 --> 03:06.377
I told him that if I ever heard of

03:06.379 --> 03:08.279
another Silver Bells murder,

03:09.191 --> 03:10.481
I would come back...

03:12.784 --> 03:14.125
... and I would expose him.

03:15.098 --> 03:16.912
Year after year of no killings,

03:16.923 --> 03:19.056
- it felt like...
- Confirmation.

03:21.113 --> 03:22.976
- You didn't think you should tell us?
- Tessa...

03:23.340 --> 03:25.799
You left us alone in
a house with a killer?

03:25.823 --> 03:26.964
I didn't have any proof.

03:28.467 --> 03:29.871
Time to change bandages.

03:29.939 --> 03:31.301
We'll need a few minutes.

03:35.608 --> 03:36.558
Cam...

03:41.498 --> 03:42.763
I need a favor.

03:53.479 --> 03:55.890
I can't reconcile it in my mind.

03:55.962 --> 03:57.061
I can't.

03:58.104 --> 03:59.946
For the rest of our lives...

03:59.998 --> 04:02.228
for the rest of my daughters' lives...

04:03.302 --> 04:05.652
we'll be living under this shadow.

04:07.506 --> 04:09.080
Ending the campaign will take

04:09.092 --> 04:10.861
some of the spectacle away, but...

04:10.873 --> 04:12.215
Ending the campaign?

04:12.731 --> 04:14.411
Let me run some focus groups

04:14.617 --> 04:16.213
before you make any decisions.

04:18.301 --> 04:19.986
Thank you for keeping the faith.

04:34.967 --> 04:36.533
I was just heading out.

04:42.008 --> 04:43.507
I'll call you tomorrow.

04:51.373 --> 04:52.816
I'll be in the guest room.

05:04.925 --> 05:06.664
Tess, I'm really sorry.

05:06.784 --> 05:09.422
I am so, so sorry I couldn't
make it to the hospital.

05:09.454 --> 05:12.169
It would have been nice, since
you're the reason he got stabbed.

05:12.737 --> 05:14.867
I made an assumption about him,

05:15.458 --> 05:16.485
based on the evidence,

05:16.512 --> 05:18.486
and I know I should have
waited for the bigger picture

05:18.824 --> 05:20.282
and, uh, I'm sorry, Tess.

05:21.046 --> 05:22.751
Look... how about

05:23.186 --> 05:25.816
I ask the lieutenant for some time off?

05:25.818 --> 05:27.685
You know, now this case is closed,

05:27.687 --> 05:29.388
maybe we should spend
some more time together,

05:29.388 --> 05:32.577
and we can maybe work on some
of our trust issues, you know...

05:33.137 --> 05:35.059
I feel like we need that.

05:36.251 --> 05:37.733
Do you know how early you have to wake up

05:37.735 --> 05:39.160
for hot air balloon rides?

05:40.779 --> 05:42.966
- No.
- Really early.

05:44.705 --> 05:48.520
The winds are most stable in
the hours right after sunrise.

05:49.569 --> 05:51.532
I was obsessed as a kid.

05:51.777 --> 05:53.478
Too much Jules Verne.

05:55.291 --> 05:56.969
On my tenth birthday, my dad

05:56.995 --> 05:59.609
surprised me at 5:00 a.m.
and took me to the airfields.

06:02.905 --> 06:04.610
I got that as a souvenir.

06:09.159 --> 06:11.061
It's a nice memory, babe.

06:18.804 --> 06:22.341
My tenth birthday was June 22, 1999.

06:25.837 --> 06:27.865
Before he surprised me,

06:29.285 --> 06:32.205
my dad was murdering his first victim.

06:38.395 --> 06:39.938
Was my dad real?

06:41.713 --> 06:43.305
Was Mitchell Hawthorne

06:43.332 --> 06:45.462
just a character that he played

06:45.537 --> 06:47.925
to seem normal so people wouldn't suspect

06:47.947 --> 06:49.215
he was a killer?

06:49.678 --> 06:52.142
Or was he just a normal guy with this...

06:52.147 --> 06:53.922
- this desire...
- Tess. Tess.

06:54.340 --> 06:56.832
Maybe it's not a bad idea

06:57.084 --> 06:59.375
if we go and speak with Dr. Larson.

06:59.660 --> 07:02.764
And we can talk about getting
you back on your medication,

07:02.782 --> 07:04.442
just for a little while.

07:22.516 --> 07:25.254
Thank you for all your
man-hours on this case, everyone.

07:25.281 --> 07:26.766
As we get everything off to the warehouse,

07:26.772 --> 07:28.643
remember we are filing chronologically,

07:28.680 --> 07:30.305
not alphabetically.

07:30.509 --> 07:32.543
Take your time, get it right.

07:41.957 --> 07:43.754
_

07:54.053 --> 07:56.266
I was worried about
what you were gonna say.

07:57.069 --> 07:58.569
But you were smart.

08:01.974 --> 08:03.422
Well, I figured this way,

08:03.432 --> 08:05.576
people would stop asking questions.

08:13.107 --> 08:14.885
Don't second-guess this.

08:16.673 --> 08:19.605
It's best to let your father
take the fall for everything.

09:11.505 --> 09:13.595
_

09:30.214 --> 09:33.061
You just left the first
Silver Bells murder house

09:33.077 --> 09:35.851
doing 80 miles per hour to your in-laws'.

09:37.595 --> 09:38.875
Explain.

09:39.897 --> 09:42.151
My wife mentioned to me that her dad

09:42.210 --> 09:45.663
woke her up at 5:00 a.m. on June 22, 1999.

09:45.663 --> 09:47.992
- How could she possibly remem...
- It was for a birthday

09:48.008 --> 09:49.084
hot air balloon ride. Just...

09:49.159 --> 09:50.751
bear with me here.

09:50.918 --> 09:53.242
Brian Long's security system was disarmed

09:53.274 --> 09:55.103
at 3:48 a.m. the night of his murder.

09:55.223 --> 09:56.821
- Mm-hmm.
- Which gives Mitchell, at most,

09:56.840 --> 09:59.590
one hour and 12 minutes to
kill Brian, pose the body,

09:59.612 --> 10:00.844
clean the crime scene, and make it home

10:00.878 --> 10:02.474
in time for Tessa's birthday.

10:02.834 --> 10:03.823
Okay.

10:03.844 --> 10:06.334
Even if he took the
fastest possible route home,

10:06.454 --> 10:08.625
that leaves him only 32 minutes
for the murder and cleanup.

10:08.652 --> 10:10.018
32 minutes seems doable.

10:10.020 --> 10:11.148
- Does it?
- Yeah.

10:11.169 --> 10:13.455
For a super meticulous
murder by a first-time killer?

10:13.680 --> 10:15.439
Well, not so meticulous.

10:15.692 --> 10:17.838
He left this little piece
of ivory at the crime scene.

10:17.845 --> 10:19.687
Yeah. Okay. Apart from the one tiny clue

10:19.714 --> 10:20.906
that's never gotten us anywhere,

10:20.919 --> 10:22.838
it was a super meticulous murder.

10:22.885 --> 10:23.961
All right.

10:23.974 --> 10:26.551
So what's your working
theory here, Matlock?

10:27.004 --> 10:28.922
Somebody framed your father-in-law?

10:29.506 --> 10:31.426
By putting his blood on a murder weapon

10:31.443 --> 10:33.547
and throwing it into
a tunnel 14 years ago?

10:33.560 --> 10:35.092
Well, I'm not saying it makes sense.

10:35.101 --> 10:37.626
I'm saying I want to run it
down till it does make sense.

10:37.657 --> 10:38.680
Well, I'm going with you.

10:39.236 --> 10:41.469
Someone's got to play
Scully to your Mulder.

10:41.518 --> 10:43.585
You are too close to this.

10:44.755 --> 10:46.355
It shouldn't end like this.

10:46.627 --> 10:47.990
You're one of our best clients.

10:47.992 --> 10:50.025
Stick it out with us while
we discuss some rebranding.

10:50.848 --> 10:51.872
Please.

10:57.529 --> 10:59.635
Sixth client lost this week.

11:01.085 --> 11:02.113
I get it.

11:02.539 --> 11:03.888
- My campaign...
- This is... No.

11:03.891 --> 11:06.253
This is not just your crisis.

11:07.066 --> 11:08.512
The company's going to take a bath.

11:08.533 --> 11:09.693
We need to think about

11:09.712 --> 11:12.492
how we're going to
handle this financially.

11:12.850 --> 11:14.416
What it means for the girls.

11:14.536 --> 11:15.851
Private school.

11:17.121 --> 11:18.525
We can weather this.

11:20.181 --> 11:21.411
But we need to do it together,

11:21.420 --> 11:22.960
and that means you and me

11:23.627 --> 11:25.193
and no one else.

11:25.201 --> 11:27.021
We agreed we could
sleep with other people.

11:27.031 --> 11:28.837
Sleep with other people.

11:29.805 --> 11:31.433
Not text them "I love you."

11:32.077 --> 11:33.201
I never did that.

11:34.238 --> 11:35.196
She did.

11:36.246 --> 11:37.369
Texted you.

11:37.902 --> 11:39.430
When we were at your mom's.

11:45.023 --> 11:46.263
I deleted it.

11:51.909 --> 11:54.107
Should I even fight for this marriage?

12:00.612 --> 12:02.497
What you should do is

12:02.832 --> 12:04.747
go and take advantage of our arrangement.

12:04.777 --> 12:07.023
Just have a little fun.
Blow off some steam.

12:07.045 --> 12:08.562
You don't need her anymore.

12:08.772 --> 12:10.423
The campaign is over.

12:11.305 --> 12:14.280
- Nothing has been decided yet...
- It's over.

12:15.389 --> 12:18.044
She's extending it to stay in your life.

12:23.914 --> 12:25.292
End it.

12:42.606 --> 12:44.472
Uh, Christina?

12:44.499 --> 12:46.508
You don't know me, but Garrett sent me.

12:49.246 --> 12:50.656
You must be the brother I helped,

12:50.681 --> 12:52.713
if that detox story was even true.

12:52.833 --> 12:54.911
It is. And

12:55.415 --> 12:57.822
- thank you for that.
- Okay.

12:58.757 --> 13:00.422
Now that he can't stalk me,

13:00.424 --> 13:02.158
are you taking over for him?

13:02.440 --> 13:04.242
Garrett wants to see you.

13:05.559 --> 13:08.457
He wants to explain himself.

13:09.633 --> 13:11.972
It's all a big misunderstanding?

13:15.084 --> 13:16.604
If... I mean, if you could
just give him a chance...

13:16.607 --> 13:18.106
He is insane.

13:18.108 --> 13:20.093
You're insane. Your family's insane.

13:20.213 --> 13:21.760
Must be in your blood.

13:24.913 --> 13:26.882
Don't ever come near me again.

13:42.699 --> 13:44.901
No, for real, I'll get you next time.

13:46.003 --> 13:48.270
You know I'm good for it.

13:51.153 --> 13:52.773
Hey, man.

13:55.475 --> 13:58.352
Looks like you need something
to take the edge off.

14:12.993 --> 14:14.229
Why...

14:41.619 --> 14:43.542
Hi. This is Tessa Ross.

14:43.582 --> 14:47.295
I need Dr. Larson's next
available appointment, please.

14:48.443 --> 14:49.895
Yes.

14:51.535 --> 14:53.324
Tomorrow is great.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.710
G... great.

14:56.240 --> 14:57.774
I'm sorry, can you hang on a second?

14:57.808 --> 14:59.555
I'm getting another call.

15:02.646 --> 15:04.826
Principal Gates, is this about...

15:05.549 --> 15:07.274
What?

15:07.556 --> 15:10.312
What about child endangerment?

15:10.366 --> 15:11.757
No.

15:11.784 --> 15:14.553
What about obscenely
debasing a national landmark?

15:14.768 --> 15:18.446
Would that be worse than
association with a serial killer?

15:18.856 --> 15:21.417
They said it depended on the landmark.

15:22.762 --> 15:24.570
But, ultimately, no.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.379
The serial killer dad is worse.

15:26.499 --> 15:28.933
And it just... goes on like this?

15:28.987 --> 15:31.245
We did find that having
a serial killer father

15:31.272 --> 15:33.511
is better than being a killer yourself.

15:34.883 --> 15:38.113
But it's still considered
worse than bestiality.

15:40.133 --> 15:44.133
So Conley could pleasure
his dog and still beat me?

15:44.670 --> 15:47.393
The data does support that, yes.

15:57.201 --> 15:59.467
Schedule a press conference for tomorrow.

16:01.868 --> 16:03.468
I'm dropping out.

16:04.436 --> 16:06.499
You're in a living nightmare.

16:06.526 --> 16:09.041
You need this.

16:22.285 --> 16:24.813
Cam? Cam?

16:27.415 --> 16:30.090
God. Jack, you stay right there.

16:32.572 --> 16:34.017
Cam!

16:34.850 --> 16:36.181
Oh...

16:36.301 --> 16:39.294
Tess, I am so sorry.

16:39.334 --> 16:41.351
You're going to rehab right now.

16:41.362 --> 16:43.126
Or you're gonna lose your son.

16:45.277 --> 16:47.617
Let's go to my house, okay?

16:59.763 --> 17:00.800
What are you talking about?

17:00.827 --> 17:03.448
I want Tessa to take care
of Jack while I'm in here.

17:04.242 --> 17:05.559
No way. I'll keep him.

17:05.573 --> 17:07.656
He was abandoned at school
while we were getting high.

17:07.912 --> 17:09.714
Cut yourself some slack.

17:09.915 --> 17:12.597
Your father is a killer. You're
being publically tormented.

17:12.617 --> 17:14.439
I need help. So do you.

17:14.559 --> 17:16.233
And Jack needs to be with stable people.

17:16.354 --> 17:17.619
I'm his mother.

17:17.660 --> 17:18.884
I have rights.

17:18.916 --> 17:22.689
Not if I call Child Protective Services.

17:29.190 --> 17:30.575
Hmm.

17:32.235 --> 17:33.950
Come here, baby.

17:34.266 --> 17:35.745
I love you.

17:35.987 --> 17:37.761
I'll be good.

17:51.582 --> 17:53.397
Oh, I've always lived
in this neighborhood.

17:53.438 --> 17:55.522
And when this house went
for sale, I just knew.

17:55.802 --> 17:57.101
I had to have it, you know?

17:57.103 --> 17:58.318
So it didn't bother you

17:58.350 --> 18:00.471
that it was the scene
of the first SBK murder?

18:00.473 --> 18:03.250
Well, I'm kind of a true crime aficionado.

18:03.309 --> 18:05.563
With an emphasis on Silver Bells-ology.

18:07.198 --> 18:08.370
Um...

18:08.748 --> 18:10.355
So you wouldn't mind
if we borrowed your home

18:10.371 --> 18:12.355
to recreate a few murder scenarios?

18:13.108 --> 18:14.587
As long as I can help.

18:16.556 --> 18:17.755
Fine.

18:17.757 --> 18:19.757
You can be our official timekeeper.

18:21.427 --> 18:22.300
Okay.

18:22.364 --> 18:24.747
I've got 32 minutes to break in,

18:24.764 --> 18:26.344
kill you, pose you

18:26.554 --> 18:27.834
and clean up.

18:28.522 --> 18:30.195
Really like you guys.

18:32.172 --> 18:34.513
Your platelets probably made a huge scab

18:34.535 --> 18:35.772
where the knife went in.

18:37.089 --> 18:39.644
I have an appointment upstairs,

18:39.646 --> 18:41.368
and Jack just wanted to

18:41.415 --> 18:43.819
- say his version of "Get well soon."
- Oh.

18:44.330 --> 18:46.836
I got this off one of the nurses.

18:47.369 --> 18:49.025
Thought you might like it.

18:49.455 --> 18:50.606
Not really.

18:52.289 --> 18:54.392
Okay, well, why don't
you try squeezing him?

18:56.629 --> 18:59.238
Ouch. You're crushing my pancreas.

18:59.358 --> 19:00.232
Ow.

19:00.275 --> 19:01.873
You're crushing my pancreas.

19:01.921 --> 19:03.873
You can record your own message

19:03.900 --> 19:05.469
if you press the left paw.

19:08.321 --> 19:09.407
Why is he with you?

19:14.347 --> 19:15.808
'Cause Cam's in rehab.

19:17.488 --> 19:18.749
Okay.

19:21.682 --> 19:23.521
Do you know if he was able to...

19:23.523 --> 19:25.752
He went by Christina's clinic, yes.

19:26.492 --> 19:28.828
Rough neighborhood,
apparently. Lots of dealers.

19:30.496 --> 19:32.216
Don't blame yourself for that.

19:33.249 --> 19:35.833
You can blame yourself for
not telling us about Dad.

19:39.672 --> 19:40.951
You know, Tess,

19:41.005 --> 19:43.323
I tortured myself about that decision.

19:43.613 --> 19:45.625
For years. Um...

19:46.480 --> 19:48.779
Wondering if I made the right call...

19:50.831 --> 19:52.073
I still wonder.

19:56.322 --> 19:58.458
When I think about everything I missed...

20:05.832 --> 20:08.566
I did what I believed
was the right thing to do.

20:13.011 --> 20:14.538
For everybody.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.605
Why don't you go to your appointment?

20:20.417 --> 20:21.912
He can stay with me for a while.

20:22.406 --> 20:24.771
Are you sure?

20:24.966 --> 20:26.617
Yeah, we'll be okay.

20:28.488 --> 20:30.554
I'll just be upstairs, okay?

20:37.920 --> 20:39.574
I've been to the hospital

20:40.065 --> 20:41.848
twice this week.

20:42.364 --> 20:45.255
I still haven't seen a single dead body.

20:47.106 --> 20:48.439
All right, you know what?

20:48.559 --> 20:51.513
Let's get this out of your system.

21:00.105 --> 21:01.719
When we open the skull,

21:01.721 --> 21:04.121
notice the cerebral hypoxia.

21:04.442 --> 21:06.042
The subject drowned, correct?

21:06.162 --> 21:09.909
- Correct.
- Note the oxygen deprivation's effect

21:10.029 --> 21:12.278
on the brain cells.

21:12.590 --> 21:14.994
I can't talk you out of this?

21:18.938 --> 21:21.078
You would have made a great mayor.

21:24.806 --> 21:27.978
- What'll you do next?
- Not sure.

21:29.615 --> 21:31.781
I could find a way to stay in Boston.

21:31.815 --> 21:33.773
Yeah, the weather's not great, but...

21:34.087 --> 21:35.673
I do love the people.

21:36.332 --> 21:38.100
You'd stay in Boston?

21:39.028 --> 21:40.458
If I had a reason.

21:43.781 --> 21:45.415
Tom confronted me.

21:45.932 --> 21:48.332
He said he knows all about us, that...

21:49.902 --> 21:52.514
... I just add a little
spice to your marriage.

21:56.075 --> 21:57.708
I think it's more than that.

22:01.940 --> 22:03.896
I think you do, too.

22:11.364 --> 22:14.000
But at some point you
have to make a choice.

22:52.865 --> 22:54.247
Bell.

22:54.934 --> 22:56.683
You got to get rid of the fingerprints.

22:56.695 --> 22:58.134
Shut up, you're dead.

23:01.770 --> 23:03.114
Done!

23:03.545 --> 23:05.658
31 minutes, 42 seconds.

23:05.682 --> 23:07.336
See?

23:07.880 --> 23:09.547
Sixth time's a charm.

23:09.549 --> 23:11.060
The timeline works.

23:11.180 --> 23:12.761
- Yeah.
- Let's go home.

23:13.037 --> 23:14.630
The timeline's possible,

23:14.750 --> 23:16.187
but barely, I mean...

23:16.189 --> 23:18.734
that's what? 18 seconds to spare.

23:18.758 --> 23:20.596
All right, well, then you're
missing something simple

23:20.603 --> 23:21.859
like maybe the...

23:21.861 --> 23:23.674
the clock on the
security system was wrong.

23:23.694 --> 23:25.664
No, no. The 3:48 a.m. break-in time

23:25.665 --> 23:27.623
is similar to all the other
murders. It's not that.

23:27.688 --> 23:29.200
That was a new security system.

23:29.398 --> 23:31.431
The Realtor told me
that the Longs upgraded

23:31.458 --> 23:33.555
to a state-of-the-art system
right after the break-in

23:33.571 --> 23:34.887
across the street at the McEwans',

23:34.959 --> 23:36.841
even though the burglar
didn't steal anything.

23:36.843 --> 23:38.729
But he didn't take anything
because the police caught him?

23:38.755 --> 23:40.244
No, no.

23:40.246 --> 23:42.187
He bypassed the alarm,
moved some stuff around,

23:42.209 --> 23:43.828
and got interrupted by the dog.

23:43.948 --> 23:46.118
Neighbors started to call
him the feng shui bandit.

23:46.468 --> 23:49.846
Do you remember exactly
what this bandit moved?

23:49.894 --> 23:51.223
It was weird stuff.

23:51.390 --> 23:53.132
The curtains were retied,

23:53.336 --> 23:55.552
dining room table was slightly off kilter.

23:55.574 --> 23:57.424
The chairs around it
had all been rearranged.

23:57.445 --> 24:00.116
So that one chair was
separate from all the others?

24:01.143 --> 24:02.224
How'd you know that?

24:03.803 --> 24:05.335
Do you think that burglary
across the street...

24:05.338 --> 24:06.720
Wasn't a burglary.

24:07.225 --> 24:09.565
It could have been Silver
Bells' first attempt.

24:09.844 --> 24:12.700
He... he's trying to
set the scene just right,

24:12.717 --> 24:15.336
get a perfect tableau
for posing his victims.

24:15.955 --> 24:18.471
He just didn't count on
being interrupted by a dog.

24:18.591 --> 24:21.156
Oh, that's crazy...

24:21.780 --> 24:22.812
but it totally makes sense.

24:22.822 --> 24:24.168
I wonder if the gnome saw it.

24:24.195 --> 24:25.356
The...

24:25.658 --> 24:27.314
The gnome from outside?

24:27.994 --> 24:31.152
It had a motion-activated
bird-watching cam in it.

24:31.330 --> 24:33.030
It was pointed right at the McEwans'.

24:35.396 --> 24:37.423
I think that footage is still in evidence.

24:37.461 --> 24:39.096
Right, but we only looked
at the night of the murder.

24:39.107 --> 24:41.685
We didn't look at the night of
the burglary across the street.

24:42.298 --> 24:45.158
So, how married are you exactly?

24:45.181 --> 24:48.561
Very publicly married
with two kids, as you know.

24:49.036 --> 24:51.844
And yet you still somehow
find the time for...

24:52.425 --> 24:53.951
CrossFit, I'm guessing?

24:53.953 --> 24:55.819
You have no shame, do you, Jennifer?

24:56.184 --> 24:57.567
What's "shame"?

25:00.800 --> 25:03.042
Madeline, do you have a statement?

25:06.499 --> 25:09.907
- What the hell is going on?
- Alison invited us here.

25:16.909 --> 25:18.916
Why did you invite the press here?

25:21.702 --> 25:23.579
I'm announcing the end of my run.

25:25.414 --> 25:27.995
There's no way I can bounce
back after what Dad did.

25:28.275 --> 25:29.587
We didn't know.

25:30.152 --> 25:31.975
We're victims, too.

25:32.410 --> 25:34.072
They're taking everything good

25:34.099 --> 25:36.814
about the Hawthorne name
and stripping it away.

25:39.369 --> 25:42.081
And we're giving them
exactly what they want.

25:42.493 --> 25:44.366
- Defeat.
- Mom,

25:45.543 --> 25:46.883
it's over.

25:59.923 --> 26:02.166
You have an obstacle in front of you.

26:02.588 --> 26:05.301
You can go over it or around it,

26:05.500 --> 26:07.528
but you cannot let it stop you.

26:10.507 --> 26:13.519
You have everything I ever
wanted at your fingertips,

26:13.866 --> 26:15.998
and much of that is because of me.

26:16.402 --> 26:17.977
My decisions.

26:18.204 --> 26:20.059
My sacrifices.

26:26.738 --> 26:28.717
You will not squander this

26:29.293 --> 26:31.248
for either of us.

26:46.022 --> 26:47.558
Brian Long.

26:48.080 --> 26:49.570
Michael Reid.

26:49.893 --> 26:51.506
Camillia Morgan.

26:51.695 --> 26:53.146
Anita Sandoval.

26:53.603 --> 26:55.023
Samuel Altbrook.

26:55.365 --> 26:57.024
David Morales.

26:57.367 --> 27:00.440
Those are the victims of
the Silver Bells Killer,

27:00.604 --> 27:03.834
and I sympathize so
deeply with their families.

27:04.174 --> 27:07.130
Their loss is incalculable.

27:08.144 --> 27:10.991
I wish, desperately,

27:11.348 --> 27:14.416
that I had known who my father really was

27:14.631 --> 27:16.594
so that I could have stopped him.

27:17.794 --> 27:20.257
I failed in that regard.

27:22.325 --> 27:24.071
But I didn't kill anyone.

27:27.659 --> 27:29.970
My great-grandfather had

27:30.090 --> 27:32.266
one single prized possession:

27:32.826 --> 27:36.229
a theater program autographed
by one of the greatest actors

27:36.239 --> 27:38.311
of that period, Edwin Booth.

27:38.375 --> 27:40.457
A man respected and beloved

27:40.577 --> 27:43.344
for who he was and what he did,

27:43.346 --> 27:46.066
despite the fact that his brother murdered

27:46.082 --> 27:47.910
the president of the United States.

27:49.943 --> 27:53.713
I am the daughter of Mitchell Hawthorne,

27:54.353 --> 27:56.859
but I am no more to blame for what he did

27:56.860 --> 28:00.119
than Edwin Booth was for
what John Wilkes Booth did.

28:00.614 --> 28:04.142
We do not live in biblical times
where children were punished

28:04.422 --> 28:06.197
for the sins of their parents.

28:06.317 --> 28:08.169
This is 2016.

28:08.337 --> 28:10.149
We stand or fall

28:10.269 --> 28:13.769
by our own virtues and our own failings...

28:15.248 --> 28:17.770
... so I won't quit this race.

28:19.432 --> 28:20.610
I can't.

28:20.959 --> 28:24.407
I care too much about Boston

28:24.854 --> 28:26.015
and its people,

28:26.069 --> 28:28.005
its schools and its streets,

28:28.032 --> 28:30.463
its homes and its hospitals.

28:30.850 --> 28:34.128
I know I can affect
positive change in this city,

28:34.130 --> 28:36.099
and I won't stop

28:36.219 --> 28:38.665
until I do exactly that.

28:39.047 --> 28:41.069
What is your strategy
moving forward, Alison?

28:41.071 --> 28:42.522
Alison, do you still think you
have a shot at winning this?

28:42.539 --> 28:44.216
Have you reached out to
any of the other families?

28:44.738 --> 28:46.142
Is your family supportive

28:46.209 --> 28:48.509
of your decision to stay in the race?

28:59.411 --> 29:00.696
You look terrible.

29:03.336 --> 29:05.875
- I'm glad you...
- Your brother said you had an explanation.

29:09.999 --> 29:11.165
I'm sorry.

29:11.496 --> 29:13.167
That's not an explanation.

29:15.551 --> 29:16.960
I felt guilty...

29:17.729 --> 29:19.440
for what my father did...

29:23.565 --> 29:25.279
... and I wanted to know
what happened to you,

29:25.744 --> 29:27.535
how your life turned out.

29:28.686 --> 29:30.380
So I found you...

29:31.736 --> 29:33.080
and I followed you.

29:38.828 --> 29:40.266
You cut your hand.

29:42.364 --> 29:43.666
Yeah.

29:46.984 --> 29:48.383
Chopping carrots?

29:50.140 --> 29:51.314
No.

29:54.043 --> 29:55.343
You're out of your mind.

29:55.345 --> 29:57.487
No, I just wanted to
know that you were okay.

29:58.429 --> 30:00.015
That's all.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.156
I didn't know that...

30:04.354 --> 30:06.469
- I never thought that you... you would...
- What?

30:07.733 --> 30:09.255
Trust you?

30:10.261 --> 30:11.992
Sleep with you?

30:13.778 --> 30:16.690
- Stab you and leave you to die?
- No, mean something to me.

30:18.768 --> 30:20.395
I thought you'd be a housewife

30:20.804 --> 30:23.757
with a husband and two kids
in... in the suburbs somewhere,

30:23.762 --> 30:25.768
and I could just take you
off my list of questions

30:25.784 --> 30:27.375
about everything.

30:28.578 --> 30:31.185
Then I found you and...

30:32.782 --> 30:34.081
you're open...

30:34.315 --> 30:35.805
honest.

30:37.289 --> 30:38.451
You're strange...

30:39.602 --> 30:40.849
fragile.

30:41.790 --> 30:43.452
Beautiful.

30:45.625 --> 30:47.222
What we had...

30:49.933 --> 30:51.418
... was real.

31:08.853 --> 31:10.263
Tell me everything.

31:13.323 --> 31:15.125
That is everything.

31:18.131 --> 31:20.777
You're sure you're not
leaving anything out?

31:22.778 --> 31:24.241
No.

31:29.817 --> 31:31.415
You're good...

31:33.432 --> 31:36.143
but your pulse increases just
a little when you're lying.

31:42.751 --> 31:44.085
Last chance.

31:47.027 --> 31:48.189
Talk to me.

31:53.948 --> 31:55.196
Bye.

32:11.336 --> 32:13.281
I got it from Uncle Garrett.

32:15.184 --> 32:18.793
Can we play with it?

32:20.185 --> 32:22.089
Please, please, please?

32:22.091 --> 32:24.004
If you can get it.

32:42.545 --> 32:45.120
I am happy you changed your mind.

32:45.584 --> 32:46.948
Theme of the day.

32:48.516 --> 32:50.217
Oh.

32:51.487 --> 32:53.220
You got me all wobbly.

32:53.719 --> 32:56.140
It's the first time I
ever did it with heels on.

32:57.994 --> 32:59.894
You should get back out front.

33:00.014 --> 33:02.096
My wife has big news.

33:11.741 --> 33:13.028
See?

33:13.148 --> 33:15.360
The bear didn't sink
through the pool cover.

33:15.562 --> 33:17.048
You won't, either.

33:19.172 --> 33:20.414
It's okay.

33:20.812 --> 33:22.385
Go ahead.

33:35.184 --> 33:36.710
Oh, my God.

33:36.830 --> 33:38.265
I'm coming, girls.

33:38.267 --> 33:40.183
Oh, my God. Help me.

33:40.303 --> 33:42.235
Jack, help them. Help them!

33:42.271 --> 33:43.771
Oh, my God.

33:46.348 --> 33:48.409
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

33:48.411 --> 33:49.810
Oh, my God!

33:52.561 --> 33:54.853
- What happened?
- I went... I'm so sorry.

33:54.880 --> 33:57.072
- I was watching them, and I got distracted.
- It's okay.

33:57.509 --> 33:59.022
We're all okay.

34:00.601 --> 34:02.611
But I think we should go home now.

34:05.128 --> 34:06.527
Huh?

34:06.558 --> 34:08.487
Come on, honey. Come on.

34:14.168 --> 34:16.637
Why didn't you call for help?

34:16.985 --> 34:18.646
It was science.

34:20.313 --> 34:23.654
I wanted to see how oxygen
deprivation affects your brain.

34:25.114 --> 34:27.338
What is wrong with you?!

34:48.049 --> 34:50.214
It's a facility in Maine...

34:51.181 --> 34:53.670
for kids with behavioral
issues like Jack's.

34:53.684 --> 34:56.600
Yeah, I get it. It's a junior loony bin.

35:00.801 --> 35:03.051
What the hell's in our genes, Tess?

35:03.934 --> 35:05.047
You're part mermaid.

35:06.506 --> 35:07.816
It's true.

35:08.327 --> 35:11.705
But, see, you won't grow
your tail and your gills

35:11.709 --> 35:14.474
until you turn 14.

35:25.291 --> 35:28.585
I know some scary things happened today.

35:28.705 --> 35:31.503
And, um, scary things

35:31.556 --> 35:33.418
happen sometimes.

35:33.660 --> 35:35.397
But I want you to know that I will

35:35.399 --> 35:38.238
always be here for you, okay?

35:40.396 --> 35:43.105
There is no one I love more

35:43.542 --> 35:45.525
than the three of you.

36:07.764 --> 36:10.131
You have one new message.

36:10.251 --> 36:12.100
Tessa, it's Dr. Larson.

36:12.102 --> 36:14.102
I got the results back
from your blood work.

36:14.104 --> 36:15.771
Found something interesting.

36:15.773 --> 36:17.492
You are pregnant.

36:17.612 --> 36:20.676
Congratulations. I
know you've been trying.

36:20.678 --> 36:23.482
Contact my office for any
referrals you may need.

36:23.542 --> 36:24.946
Take care.

36:30.654 --> 36:33.653
Squeeze me again, and I'll strangle you.

36:41.531 --> 36:42.862
Wonderful news.

36:42.982 --> 36:46.646
We've received over $80,000 in donations

36:46.673 --> 36:48.454
in the last six hours.

36:48.515 --> 36:52.387
You've completely
reinvigorated your campaign.

36:56.986 --> 36:58.249
I...

36:58.834 --> 37:01.530
called a friend in Hawaii
who's running for senator

37:01.571 --> 37:04.286
and gave you a glowing recommendation.

37:05.022 --> 37:06.848
You can start on Monday,

37:07.124 --> 37:08.670
if you want.

37:10.202 --> 37:12.985
- You're firing me?
- Officially, you're resigning

37:13.019 --> 37:15.843
to pursue other opportunities.

37:17.040 --> 37:18.600
You were right.

37:21.342 --> 37:23.783
I... I had to make a choice.

37:27.143 --> 37:29.651
Alison, this campaign is still

37:29.678 --> 37:31.426
gonna be an uphill battle.

37:32.609 --> 37:35.547
I'd rather lose the race

37:35.567 --> 37:37.147
and keep my family

37:37.853 --> 37:39.855
than the other way around.

37:43.540 --> 37:45.079
Well.

37:46.780 --> 37:49.605
I'll be sure to show you a
copy of my resignation letter

37:49.621 --> 37:51.251
before I release it to the press.

37:52.936 --> 37:54.607
You don't have to.

37:56.764 --> 37:58.329
I insist.

38:38.203 --> 38:40.844
_

38:50.869 --> 38:53.028
You wanted to discuss something?

39:09.646 --> 39:10.831
I'm done, Mom.

39:15.810 --> 39:18.564
I can't keep staring
people I love in the eye...

39:19.857 --> 39:21.350
and lying to them.

39:22.194 --> 39:23.878
Of course you can.

39:24.609 --> 39:26.161
You know what's at stake.

39:36.160 --> 39:38.811
But what if I do want to tell the truth?

39:41.350 --> 39:42.921
What would you do?

39:50.213 --> 39:51.853
Is that what happened with Dad?

39:56.408 --> 39:58.340
He wanted to tell the truth...

40:01.298 --> 40:02.761
... and you killed him?

40:14.711 --> 40:16.367
Oh, Mom.

40:18.749 --> 40:20.545
Oh, my God.

40:33.458 --> 40:36.406
You think if you come
clean, you get the girl back.

40:37.847 --> 40:41.160
That started under false pretenses.

40:42.289 --> 40:45.473
Your lives are connected by murder.

40:45.593 --> 40:47.517
She stabbed you.

40:48.404 --> 40:50.599
It's not the height of romance.

40:51.529 --> 40:53.068
So, tell the truth.

40:53.928 --> 40:55.639
You'll lose her anyway...

40:56.677 --> 40:58.786
... and the whole family would crumble.

41:00.361 --> 41:02.083
You'd have nothing...

41:04.159 --> 41:07.859
... and you'd upend their
lives all over again.

41:12.790 --> 41:15.049
But maybe that's worth it to you.

41:27.850 --> 41:30.108
The records say the footage from the gnome

41:30.109 --> 41:32.423
- was transferred to a thumb...
- A thumb drive.

41:35.079 --> 41:36.139
Ross,

41:36.477 --> 41:38.268
no matter what's on the tape,

41:39.452 --> 41:41.205
it was good police work...

41:43.189 --> 41:44.641
but in all likelihood,

41:44.652 --> 41:45.851
it's Mitchell's face we're gonna see,

41:45.894 --> 41:47.905
so be prepared for that.

41:48.025 --> 41:49.067
I am.

41:52.175 --> 41:54.413
That must be SBK's car.

41:59.362 --> 42:01.131
That right there, that reflection.

42:01.163 --> 42:03.556
That's the killer getting
back in the car, right?

42:03.676 --> 42:05.778
Yeah, the light changing is consistent

42:05.789 --> 42:07.579
with a door opening and closing.

42:08.203 --> 42:09.665
That's the passenger door.

42:12.204 --> 42:14.372
- Maybe he moved over?
- No.

42:14.614 --> 42:17.357
Car takes off as soon as the door shuts.

42:18.642 --> 42:20.668
Someone else is driving.

42:21.263 --> 42:25.598
So, that's how Mitchell
Hawthorne did it all so fast.

42:30.263 --> 42:33.294
The Silver Bells Killer wasn't one person.

42:33.617 --> 42:35.049
It was two.
