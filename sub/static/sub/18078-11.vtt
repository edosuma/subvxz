WEBVTT

00:02.111 --> 00:06.281
And when he comes to, he's starts raving
about how his shrink has been kidnapped.

00:06.365 --> 00:07.574
Where did you take my father?

00:07.658 --> 00:11.662
Well, if we're gonna talk to this guy
Stoddard, we've got quite a trip.

00:11.745 --> 00:14.665
El Presidente's daughter?
You expect me to believe that?

00:14.748 --> 00:17.751
I mean, if she says she's Richter's
daughter, then she's Richter's daughter.

00:17.835 --> 00:19.336
My real name is Marisa.

00:19.419 --> 00:21.421
I just don't know
what to believe anymore.

00:21.505 --> 00:22.673
I'm with the CIA.

00:22.756 --> 00:25.008
We're on our way out.
We're just kidding around.

00:25.092 --> 00:28.303
I was just remembering the first
time lever tortured a guy.

00:28.387 --> 00:30.430
Hey, sucker, you gonna pay.

00:32.015 --> 00:34.268
<i>In 1972,
a crack commando unit...</i>

00:34.393 --> 00:36.061
<i>was sent to prison
by a military court...</i>

00:36.186 --> 00:37.604
<i>for a crime they didn't commit.</i>

00:37.729 --> 00:38.939
<i>These men promptly escaped...</i>

00:39.064 --> 00:40.649
<i>from a maximum-security
stockade...</i>

00:40.774 --> 00:42.359
<i>to the Los Angeles underground.</i>

00:42.442 --> 00:43.944
<i>Today, still wanted
by the government...</i>

00:44.069 --> 00:45.988
<i>they survive
as soldiers of fortune.</i>

00:46.071 --> 00:48.532
<i>If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...</i>

00:48.615 --> 00:49.908
<i>and if you can find them...</i>

00:50.033 --> 00:52.578
<i>maybe you can hire the A-Team.</i>

02:18.956 --> 02:22.584
Running, running, running...

02:22.834 --> 02:26.880
but this thing keeps chomping
right at my butt every night.

02:27.339 --> 02:32.386
And no matter how hard I squeeze Mr.
Pillow...

02:33.553 --> 02:35.472
I'm still afraid to go to sleep.

02:36.431 --> 02:40.477
My problem is that everything
I dream comes true.

02:40.560 --> 02:44.690
Now, if you were me,
wouldn't you be terrified...

02:44.815 --> 02:46.024
to put your head down?

02:46.108 --> 02:48.568
Yes, but only if it was
a bad dream.

02:48.652 --> 02:49.820
Bad?

02:50.153 --> 02:51.989
Bad? You wanna talk bad?

02:52.072 --> 02:53.740
Well, let's talk last night.

02:54.533 --> 02:56.076
I had a nightmare.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.705
See, Springsteen was sick.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.790
I was on stage...

03:01.915 --> 03:03.458
the band was ready.

03:03.583 --> 03:05.711
Clarence was
out there cooking...

03:05.836 --> 03:08.463
and I was the only one who
could fill The Boss' boots.

03:08.547 --> 03:11.967
So I put on my T-shirt, I put on
my jeans, I walk out there...

03:12.050 --> 03:15.095
I open my mouth,
and all I can do is...

03:16.346 --> 03:17.306
Just like a cow.

03:18.682 --> 03:20.017
And the audience is saying...

03:20.100 --> 03:22.477
<i>"Sing Born in the USA.</i>

03:22.602 --> 03:24.401
<i>"Born in the USA."</i>

03:24.470 --> 03:25.981
And I'm going...

03:26.982 --> 03:29.443
And I fall down on all fours...

03:29.568 --> 03:33.238
and I start grazing on the
amp cords and salivating...

03:33.322 --> 03:37.451
and the audience is singing
<i>Jungleland, Jungleland</i>.

03:37.534 --> 03:39.536
And then I exploded.

03:40.537 --> 03:41.413
What do you think?

03:41.496 --> 03:43.915
I think, Murdock,
it's your same old...

03:43.999 --> 03:46.960
anxiety-frustration problems.

03:47.085 --> 03:49.588
If you have any
anxiety-frustration problems.

03:49.629 --> 03:52.966
You really think that I
even know what reality is?

03:53.050 --> 03:55.761
You know everything
about reality, Murdock.

03:56.595 --> 03:57.471
Everything.

03:57.596 --> 04:00.223
But you choose to live
in a fantasy world.

04:01.099 --> 04:04.186
And you build this fantasy
world for everybody to see...

04:04.269 --> 04:05.604
including me.

04:05.729 --> 04:07.814
I said it again
and again and again.

04:07.939 --> 04:11.401
It's time that you deal
with reality.

04:11.943 --> 04:15.072
And I think we ought
to start with the A-Team.

04:15.739 --> 04:19.076
I don't know what
you're talking about.

04:19.159 --> 04:21.577
You know, I can do
these sessions by myself.

04:22.871 --> 04:24.289
Do you hear that?

04:26.541 --> 04:28.126
Yes, I hear it.

04:28.418 --> 04:29.836
It's real.

04:31.171 --> 04:34.966
I'd be very, very, very upset
with you, Murdock...

04:35.425 --> 04:38.387
if you're so good at this
that you're a fraud.

04:38.804 --> 04:40.972
I'd hate to lose you
as a patient.

04:41.223 --> 04:44.351
I mean, you're the
best patient I've got.

04:44.810 --> 04:46.144
In fact...

04:46.603 --> 04:47.938
you could be
a professional patient.

04:48.021 --> 04:51.149
Oh, Doc, I think you're
trying to trip me up here.

04:52.192 --> 04:55.904
I respect the fact that you
want to protect your friends.

04:56.321 --> 04:58.782
But I happen to be
a friend, remember?

04:59.908 --> 05:01.743
All right, I'll tell you what.

05:03.662 --> 05:05.580
I'm gonna go out on a limb...

05:05.956 --> 05:07.624
because I think...

05:08.291 --> 05:10.335
that we're close
to a breakthrough.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.379
You've been
pressing me like crazy.

05:12.587 --> 05:16.174
If I get one more breakthrough
before the month is over...

05:16.883 --> 05:18.552
I win a trip to Hawaii.

05:18.677 --> 05:20.887
Oh, by all means,
give it your best shot, Doc.

05:26.810 --> 05:29.771
I'm about to tell you something
that nobody else knows.

05:30.480 --> 05:31.940
I'm gonna trust you.

05:32.065 --> 05:34.401
- You sure you wanna do this?
- Absolutely.

05:34.526 --> 05:36.695
I'm telling you this because
I want to prove to you...

05:36.820 --> 05:38.488
that you can trust me.

05:38.655 --> 05:40.240
I'm not a doctor.

05:41.908 --> 05:44.619
No, I mean, I'm a doctor in the
sense that I'm a psychologist...

05:44.703 --> 05:46.705
I have a PhD,
but I'm not a medical doctor.

05:46.746 --> 05:48.790
I mean, I can't practice
as a psychiatrist.

05:48.915 --> 05:51.460
- But the army--
- Thinks that I'm an MD.

05:51.626 --> 05:53.044
But I lied.

05:53.170 --> 05:56.173
Because the pay rates
in those days weren't fair.

05:56.339 --> 05:59.676
Do you know that MDs got twice
as much as psychologists?

05:59.759 --> 06:01.136
But you're so well-known.

06:01.219 --> 06:03.096
I know. That's the problem.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.724
I'm so successful
as a psychiatrist...

06:05.807 --> 06:08.727
that I can't go back
and set the record straight.

06:10.187 --> 06:12.647
Is that really the truth?

06:17.110 --> 06:19.404
Are you really
part of the A-Team?

06:29.039 --> 06:30.916
Mommy, Daddy...

06:30.999 --> 06:33.084
what are you doing home early?

06:33.210 --> 06:37.172
You promised that I could stay
up late and watch Johnny.

06:37.547 --> 06:38.798
Who the hell is this guy?

06:38.882 --> 06:41.384
He's a patient. He's had a mental
breakdown. Please don't hurt him.

06:41.468 --> 06:42.969
Uncle Pete...

06:43.136 --> 06:46.389
what are you doing back
from Toronto?

06:52.854 --> 06:54.022
Knock him out.

07:00.070 --> 07:02.364
Oh, Richie...

07:02.447 --> 07:04.699
you always get to play doctor.

07:04.824 --> 07:08.870
Why don't I ever get
to play doctor?

07:15.085 --> 07:16.962
We are out of here.

08:46.926 --> 08:48.595
Hello, emergency?

08:48.928 --> 08:51.097
There has been
a terrible accident.

08:51.222 --> 08:52.724
I think you better come.

08:53.892 --> 08:55.727
What do you mean where?

08:55.852 --> 08:58.480
1347, Old Malibu Road.

08:58.772 --> 09:01.524
My wife fell off
the deck into the ocean.

09:02.025 --> 09:03.443
I'm crying.

09:03.526 --> 09:06.071
No, no,
we have not been drinking.

09:06.529 --> 09:07.989
Why, thank you.

09:08.448 --> 09:09.616
Hurry up.

09:43.108 --> 09:46.653
<i>Now, you see, Wendy,
what is happening here, see...</i>

09:46.903 --> 09:49.864
<i>is the vampire has you trapped.</i>

09:50.824 --> 09:56.786
<i>And you, you are gazing
into his eyes.</i>

09:56.830 --> 09:58.331
See, gazing.

09:58.581 --> 09:59.749
That's it. That's it.

09:59.874 --> 10:02.460
And then you say...

10:04.045 --> 10:06.214
Bite me, please.

10:06.673 --> 10:07.632
Perfect.

10:08.383 --> 10:09.509
Perfect.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.678
- Really?
- Really.

10:12.011 --> 10:13.888
Oh, yes, yes, really.

10:13.972 --> 10:17.475
Oh, Wendy,
I think that you are...

10:17.851 --> 10:20.103
this far from...

10:20.395 --> 10:22.480
nailing down this part.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.901
Excuse me.

10:27.402 --> 10:29.028
Wonder who that could be?

10:29.696 --> 10:31.281
The director, maybe.

10:31.781 --> 10:32.824
Oh, no, no, the...

10:32.907 --> 10:34.826
The director's in Europe
scouting locations.

10:34.951 --> 10:37.704
Now, you just keep rehearsing.

10:41.541 --> 10:43.042
Bite me.

10:46.629 --> 10:47.547
Yes.

10:47.672 --> 10:49.048
You phoned in the emergency?

10:49.132 --> 10:51.593
Something about a woman
falling off a balcony?

10:52.927 --> 10:55.138
Oh, well, maybe things
have been taken care of.

10:55.263 --> 10:56.431
Bite me!

10:56.598 --> 10:57.849
What about the lady?

10:57.974 --> 10:58.850
Lady?

10:58.933 --> 11:01.394
Oh! Well,
she's fully recovered...

11:01.519 --> 11:03.104
as you can see.

11:03.271 --> 11:04.439
Bite me!

11:04.564 --> 11:05.857
Please!

11:06.775 --> 11:08.109
Bite me!

11:08.943 --> 11:09.903
Please.

11:09.986 --> 11:11.154
Bite me.

11:11.279 --> 11:13.281
Sorry for the inconvenience.

11:13.615 --> 11:15.033
No problem.

11:19.037 --> 11:21.164
Bite me, please.

11:27.170 --> 11:29.047
He comes staggering in...

11:29.130 --> 11:31.841
just as I'm about to give her...

11:31.925 --> 11:35.595
the lead in
<i>Rock 'N' Roll Vampire</i>.

11:36.221 --> 11:38.348
Then when he comes to,
he starts raving about...

11:38.431 --> 11:41.643
how his shrink has been
kidnapped in broad daylight...

11:41.726 --> 11:43.645
by American soldiers.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.021
How'd he know you were out here?

11:45.146 --> 11:46.564
It was not a dream.

11:46.815 --> 11:48.107
It was real.

11:48.149 --> 11:50.276
The man was so loose,
he looked like a pretzel.

11:50.360 --> 11:52.111
But they hit me with something.

11:52.654 --> 11:53.947
A drug.

11:53.988 --> 11:56.407
That's why I was loose.
That's why I was acting crazy.

11:56.533 --> 11:57.951
Yeah, sure,
blame it on the medicine.

11:58.034 --> 12:00.245
Oh, that's right, B.A.,
just jump on the bandwagon...

12:00.328 --> 12:02.747
ball up our friendship
like junk mail. Go ahead.

12:02.872 --> 12:05.834
I checked all the newspapers this morning.
Television.

12:05.917 --> 12:08.545
Not a thing about
a kidnapping at the VA.

12:08.670 --> 12:09.671
More nightmares.

12:09.796 --> 12:12.006
You've got all the demons in the book
chasing after you in your sleep.

12:12.131 --> 12:14.384
They were not demons.
They were men.

12:14.509 --> 12:17.053
They snatched my shrink,
and I want him back.

12:17.136 --> 12:20.139
Murdock, why would someone want
to kidnap your psychiatrist?

12:20.598 --> 12:23.101
I don't know.
I mean, all I know is...

12:23.226 --> 12:24.477
they were big...

12:24.686 --> 12:26.437
and they had a chopper.

12:26.521 --> 12:28.022
Sounded like a 500D.

12:28.106 --> 12:29.941
And he was a military doctor.

12:30.024 --> 12:32.735
They burned some files
or something.

12:32.819 --> 12:35.280
He was privy to
a lot of secret stuff.

12:35.446 --> 12:39.826
I mean, the wrong guy could've said the
wrong thing on the couch. I don't know.

12:39.909 --> 12:40.952
Okay, Face.

12:41.035 --> 12:43.580
You go to the hospital and check
out the whereabouts of the doctor.

12:44.038 --> 12:45.540
We'll go to his home.

12:45.707 --> 12:47.500
See if someone could
give us some information.

12:47.625 --> 12:49.294
I really appreciate this,
Hannibal.

12:49.377 --> 12:50.420
Thanks, guys.

12:50.461 --> 12:52.714
Anything to keep you
as an adult.

13:17.030 --> 13:17.989
Miss Richter?

13:18.114 --> 13:19.073
Can I help you?

13:19.198 --> 13:21.576
I'm Colonel Brown,
the United States Air Force.

13:21.659 --> 13:23.453
Used to run with your daddy...

13:23.953 --> 13:25.622
back in med school days.

13:25.747 --> 13:26.956
It was a long time ago.

13:27.081 --> 13:29.500
We went our separate ways,
and he went into psychiatry...

13:29.626 --> 13:30.627
and I went into brain surgery.

13:30.710 --> 13:34.172
Anyhow, I was in town, I
thought for old times' sake...

13:34.297 --> 13:35.673
I'd stop by...

13:36.090 --> 13:37.091
and see if he was around.

13:37.175 --> 13:38.927
Well, I'm sure he's gonna be
sorry that he missed you...

13:39.052 --> 13:41.429
but he's gone up to San Francisco
for a few days to a seminar.

13:41.596 --> 13:42.847
That's a shame.

13:42.972 --> 13:44.807
Maybe we could
sit down and chat.

13:45.141 --> 13:47.101
I could tell you stories
about your daddy--

13:47.226 --> 13:49.812
I'd love to do that, but I'm
afraid I'm just on my way out.

13:49.896 --> 13:52.190
- I've got to go to work.
- Well, some other time.

13:52.273 --> 13:54.943
I'm in town, and if your dad
would like to get together...

13:54.984 --> 13:56.444
you have him call me
over at the Plaza Hotel.

13:56.527 --> 13:58.112
I'll do that.
Thank you for stopping by.

13:58.237 --> 13:59.405
Bye-bye.

14:05.536 --> 14:07.080
You're a regular Sally Field.

14:07.163 --> 14:08.706
Where did you take my father?

14:09.040 --> 14:10.667
ETA's two and a half minutes.

14:10.917 --> 14:12.460
ETA of what?

14:13.836 --> 14:15.129
What do you think, Colonel?

14:15.254 --> 14:17.465
I think she's turned
privacy into an art.

14:17.590 --> 14:18.925
We'll check her out.

14:19.926 --> 14:21.844
Could be hiding somewhere
behind the door.

14:21.970 --> 14:25.139
People with melted faces
and bellies like balloons.

14:31.270 --> 14:32.897
Well, according
to the hospital...

14:32.981 --> 14:35.858
Richter called in this
morning asking for a leave.

14:36.025 --> 14:38.736
Seems his mother's dying
down in Phoenix.

14:38.861 --> 14:39.946
Well, that doesn't add up.

14:40.029 --> 14:41.364
What about the fire
in the office?

14:41.447 --> 14:42.824
Well, apparently,
there was a fire.

14:42.865 --> 14:45.243
The VA thinks it was
just a case of vandalism.

14:45.326 --> 14:46.828
You know,
kids looking for drugs.

14:46.953 --> 14:49.497
We'll go around the backyard.
If there's anybody in there...

14:49.580 --> 14:50.999
we'll find him.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.721
I've got one,
and he's heavily armed.

15:46.929 --> 15:48.765
Yeah, we've got one in the den.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.609
Drop the girl!

17:16.853 --> 17:19.981
I didn't think you were
a brain surgeon.

17:26.319 --> 17:28.865
Colonel Mack Stoddard.
Ring any bells?

17:28.990 --> 17:29.949
No idea.

17:30.032 --> 17:33.202
They just came bursting into the house
and went straight for my father's study.

17:34.495 --> 17:36.706
Which way to the freeway
is it from here?

17:37.373 --> 17:38.833
Next street, take a left.

17:38.916 --> 17:41.961
The question is who is
Colonel Mack Stoddard...

17:42.044 --> 17:44.088
and why is he so hot to get
his hands on my shrink?

17:44.213 --> 17:46.799
My shrink. Nobody else's shrink.
My shrink.

17:46.883 --> 17:49.427
Your father was
like a father to me.

17:49.594 --> 17:51.387
Most of his patients
feel that way.

17:51.554 --> 17:52.889
Yes, but I'm different.
I'm special.

17:52.972 --> 17:54.599
I'm not like all the others.

17:54.682 --> 17:56.475
Yeah, well, they all say that.

17:56.601 --> 17:58.102
Yeah, but I'm different.
I'm special.

17:58.186 --> 18:00.730
Ditto, ditto,
infinity, infinity.

18:00.897 --> 18:04.567
Face, looks like you better find out all
you can about Stoddard, Colonel Mack.

18:04.650 --> 18:07.945
Oh! You know that means hitting
a military base, don't you?

18:08.029 --> 18:10.364
If we didn't throw
these challenges your way...

18:10.406 --> 18:12.158
every now and then,
life would be--

18:12.325 --> 18:13.284
Normal?

18:13.367 --> 18:14.452
Normal.

18:26.297 --> 18:27.590
Excuse me.

18:28.090 --> 18:29.550
Excuse me!

18:29.717 --> 18:32.053
Where is General Fullbright?

18:32.094 --> 18:33.763
He's at lunch.
Try back in an hour.

18:33.888 --> 18:35.681
I would, but I can't.

18:35.848 --> 18:38.226
I have to return to
my assembly point by 2:00.

18:38.309 --> 18:40.186
You see, my troop is leaving
for a two-day jamboree...

18:40.269 --> 18:41.604
and I don't want
to miss the bus.

18:41.687 --> 18:43.356
Jamboree? What are you
talking about, soldier?

18:43.439 --> 18:45.775
Please, I would like
to drop off this prisoner...

18:45.816 --> 18:47.109
and collect my reward.

18:47.235 --> 18:48.486
You're one of the A-Team.

18:49.779 --> 18:51.280
You're Templeton Peck.

18:51.364 --> 18:52.281
I know.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.825
Yes, I captured him. Right
there on the post office.

18:54.992 --> 18:57.787
You see, I was sending a birthday
card to my grandmother...

18:57.912 --> 19:01.374
and I was looking up her ZIP code in
the book when I saw his mug shot.

19:01.457 --> 19:03.668
The guy was standing
right next to me.

19:04.001 --> 19:06.712
Yeah, I should have used
the drive-through window.

19:07.421 --> 19:08.297
Good job.

19:08.381 --> 19:10.508
Yes, it's a square knot
with a half-tied brace.

19:10.591 --> 19:12.134
Look, I better notify
the General, huh?

19:12.218 --> 19:13.219
But what about my reward?

19:13.386 --> 19:14.262
I don't know if you're eligible.

19:14.345 --> 19:16.347
It's for the capture of the
entire A-Team. All three.

19:16.430 --> 19:18.683
Yes, well,
$10,000 divided by three--

19:18.766 --> 19:21.352
You stay right here.

19:21.435 --> 19:22.311
I will.

19:22.478 --> 19:23.854
- Don't move.
- I won't.

19:25.940 --> 19:27.775
Well, that wasn't too tough.

19:43.833 --> 19:45.376
"Colonel Mack Stoddard.

19:45.501 --> 19:49.255
"Military advisor with the federales
against revolutionary forces...

19:49.338 --> 19:51.424
"in Curaguay, South America.

19:51.549 --> 19:54.051
"Review pending,
disciplinary."

19:58.806 --> 20:00.933
Wonder where he keeps
the voodoo dolls.

20:05.479 --> 20:07.940
Well, if we're gonna talk
to this guy Stoddard...

20:08.024 --> 20:09.442
we've got quite a trip.

20:09.567 --> 20:11.360
Curaguay, South America?

20:11.444 --> 20:13.112
Small republic
off the Pacific coast.

20:13.195 --> 20:15.281
Revolutions average
one every 18 months.

20:15.323 --> 20:16.449
That's what I learned
in history class.

20:16.782 --> 20:18.034
How long will it
take us to get there?

20:18.159 --> 20:19.910
Oh, don't worry.
You can stay here.

20:20.077 --> 20:21.746
Owners won't be back
for two weeks.

20:21.871 --> 20:23.372
No way! I'm going.

20:23.497 --> 20:25.499
Look, this is my father
we're talking about.

20:25.583 --> 20:27.376
Hey, man, she can have
my seat on the plane.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.879
Murdock, is your Dr. Richter
a physical man?

20:30.004 --> 20:31.088
Could he escape from Stoddard?

20:31.213 --> 20:32.673
Negative, Colonel.
Strictly non-com.

20:32.757 --> 20:34.258
Well, this review pending...

20:34.383 --> 20:37.303
looks like the doctor was just about
to make a report on Stoddard.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.930
Probably saying he should share
a cell with Charlie Manson.

20:40.097 --> 20:43.017
So Stoddard destroys
all the reports on file...

20:43.100 --> 20:44.977
then grabs the doc
in hopes of...

20:45.269 --> 20:47.521
changing his review pending.

20:47.688 --> 20:48.981
I guess we better pack our bags.

20:49.106 --> 20:50.858
Forget it.
I got a new policy.

20:51.025 --> 20:52.860
I ain't going no further
south than San Diego.

20:52.943 --> 20:56.197
B.A., I have invested 10 years
of therapy in this man.

20:56.322 --> 20:59.033
He's the fourth most
important person in my life.

20:59.408 --> 21:01.660
Besides that, if you help me...

21:01.786 --> 21:04.163
I promise I'll make you a blood brother.
You can eat all my jujubes.

21:04.288 --> 21:05.456
You can count me out.

21:05.539 --> 21:07.416
You gotta help me, pal.
Don't go. Pal!

21:07.500 --> 21:09.752
You're my buddy. Pal, pal,
you've got to help me out here!

21:09.877 --> 21:11.045
No! Forget it!
I'm out of here!

21:11.170 --> 21:12.171
Don't go, please!

21:12.254 --> 21:13.923
Don't go! You can't go!

21:14.632 --> 21:16.175
No! I ain't staying!

21:16.342 --> 21:19.011
I ain't gonna give you guys a chance
to drug me and throw me on a plane.

21:21.222 --> 21:23.391
B.A.! B.A.!

21:29.814 --> 21:31.232
Let him down easy.

21:33.692 --> 21:34.944
What's wrong with him?

21:35.528 --> 21:37.113
Anxiety attack.

21:39.865 --> 21:42.535
Oh, please.

21:46.080 --> 21:47.581
Relax, Murdock.

22:10.396 --> 22:13.774
I was just remembering the first
time I ever tortured a guy.

22:13.941 --> 22:17.236
I was just a shavetail.
It was my first trip overseas.

22:17.736 --> 22:20.322
We were really having a pretty
bodacious time of it, too.

22:20.489 --> 22:22.199
I had this prisoner
who wouldn't talk.

22:22.283 --> 22:24.827
Trashed a whole pack
of cigarettes on the dude.

22:26.287 --> 22:27.496
Nothing.

22:30.749 --> 22:32.877
Then I discovered alligators.

22:33.377 --> 22:37.089
I told you, I filed nothing.

22:37.173 --> 22:39.758
Not even about my God complex?

22:40.634 --> 22:44.221
About the lunatic who wants to rule
the world with extreme prejudice?

22:44.346 --> 22:46.098
Come on, Doc.

22:46.473 --> 22:47.433
What did you tell 'em?

22:47.516 --> 22:48.642
Nothing.

22:49.310 --> 22:50.519
Whatever.

22:51.896 --> 22:54.607
What about those four guys
that were at your house?

22:54.940 --> 22:56.400
I don't know
what you're talking about.

22:56.525 --> 22:59.653
Military types. They were
helping out your daughter.

23:00.404 --> 23:03.365
Yeah. We know about her.

23:04.283 --> 23:07.953
Cute. I wouldn't mind
a little spin with her myself.

23:08.078 --> 23:10.789
Look, for the last time...

23:10.873 --> 23:14.627
I talked to no one.
I did not file the report.

23:14.793 --> 23:16.712
I hope not, for your sake.

23:16.837 --> 23:19.798
I'm going to let you hang
around here for a little while.

23:20.007 --> 23:24.178
If you decide to change your report, I might
consider letting you go in one piece.

23:24.470 --> 23:25.846
Think about it.

23:26.263 --> 23:27.723
Go to hell, Stoddard.

23:27.890 --> 23:29.183
You first.

23:34.313 --> 23:36.857
Well, I think
maybe we gave him...

23:36.941 --> 23:38.192
a little too much of that stuff.

23:38.317 --> 23:39.276
He's going to be real mad...

23:39.360 --> 23:40.611
when he finds out I tricked him.

23:40.736 --> 23:42.363
You know,
our appearances are similar.

23:42.446 --> 23:44.365
Why don't you just tell him
you hit the wrong arm?

23:45.407 --> 23:47.826
You're awfully good at this. Did
you go camping with your father?

23:47.952 --> 23:49.328
He hates camping.

23:49.453 --> 23:51.455
He told me he went camping with
his daughter all the time.

23:51.622 --> 23:53.499
That's my sister Janet
that he's talking about.

23:53.666 --> 23:56.460
You also didn't know the way from
your father's house to the freeway.

23:56.585 --> 23:58.462
It's his house, not mine.

23:58.587 --> 24:00.673
I always knew the way
to my folks house.

24:00.839 --> 24:02.299
Look, guys...

24:02.383 --> 24:06.595
Don't "look, guys" me, lady. Tell me who
you are, or you're in deep trouble.

24:06.720 --> 24:07.972
I told you who I am.

24:08.055 --> 24:11.183
Now wait a minute, Hannibal. I think
you owe this lady an apology.

24:11.267 --> 24:12.726
I would if there was
just one of her.

24:12.851 --> 24:15.437
The girl is trying
to find her father.

24:15.813 --> 24:19.566
Now you're quizzing her like
she's some chameleon con man.

24:20.067 --> 24:21.360
I mean, look at that face.

24:21.527 --> 24:23.070
Don't you believe her?
I mean, I believe her.

24:23.153 --> 24:25.906
If she says she's Richter's daughter,
then she's Richter's daughter.

24:26.031 --> 24:28.033
- I'm a journalist.
- She's a journalist.

24:28.158 --> 24:29.410
I write for <i>Transworld Press</i>.

24:29.493 --> 24:31.412
Well, anybody can
make a mistake.

24:31.537 --> 24:33.122
I'm an international stringer.

24:33.539 --> 24:35.708
Everything from bullfights
to revolutions.

24:35.833 --> 24:37.584
Did you ever do anything
on regressions?

24:37.710 --> 24:39.670
You need professional help.

24:39.795 --> 24:41.297
Yes, that's what I came
down here to get.

24:41.380 --> 24:43.799
You can never travel
too far to get the best.

24:44.133 --> 24:46.385
I'm doing a piece
on Dr. Richter.

24:46.593 --> 24:48.679
It actually started because
he was treating Mr. Murdock...

24:48.804 --> 24:50.472
who was rumored to be
connected to the A-Team.

24:50.556 --> 24:53.142
And now Richter's missing,
that's news.

24:53.309 --> 24:56.645
Hey, you guys are helping me. I
wouldn't think of doing you any harm.

24:57.563 --> 24:59.606
Besides, if you were
so suspicious of me...

24:59.690 --> 25:01.317
Why'd you bring me along
in the first place?

25:01.442 --> 25:04.528
Because I didn't know who you'd
notify of our destination.

25:04.820 --> 25:07.239
This way,
you didn't have the chance.

25:13.787 --> 25:16.498
We're looking for
Colonel Mack Stoddard.

25:16.623 --> 25:18.709
They said to ask in this bar.

25:29.720 --> 25:34.058
<i>Señores</i>, you've come to a place
where Yankees are not welcome.

25:34.350 --> 25:36.894
We do not know this man you talk about.
Now get out!

25:37.061 --> 25:39.396
No, it's nice here.
We're staying.

25:39.897 --> 25:41.065
Bad odds, my friend.

25:41.148 --> 25:43.692
Yeah, you don't wanna
wake up <i>el tigre</i>.

25:44.818 --> 25:46.403
We'll take our chances.

25:47.154 --> 25:50.282
Well, there's always
a time you got to say...

25:50.366 --> 25:52.409
what the heck? What the hey?

25:54.411 --> 25:55.579
Hey, B.A.!

25:56.205 --> 25:58.415
Wake up, B.A.
B.A., wake up!

26:06.298 --> 26:07.674
Wake up, B.A.!

26:14.848 --> 26:16.225
B.A., wake up!

26:33.242 --> 26:34.993
I ain't getting on no plane!

26:59.435 --> 27:00.894
Everybody out!

27:14.408 --> 27:15.742
Hold it right there.

27:16.702 --> 27:19.329
Sorry, your visit to
our country must be cut short.

27:19.455 --> 27:22.374
Well, we've seen most
of the sights anyway.

27:22.541 --> 27:25.502
You guys really make me mad. You
wake me up so I can get killed!

27:25.586 --> 27:28.797
Hey, you may want to kill them, but you
don't want to kill Stoddard's daughter.

27:29.047 --> 27:30.340
Stoddard's daughter?

27:30.424 --> 27:32.426
Welcome to the house
of mirrors, Face.

27:32.551 --> 27:35.512
What're you trying to pull? The colonel
didn't say his daughter was coming.

27:35.596 --> 27:38.765
Listen, my father doesn't tell flunkies
like you who's coming and going.

27:38.807 --> 27:40.851
That's why he's
Colonel Mack Stoddard.

27:41.268 --> 27:43.520
That's why he was able to win
three bronze stars in the war...

27:43.687 --> 27:46.732
to rout an enemy outpost with only a
hunting knife and a broken pistol.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.567
I've heard about that, Phillips.

27:49.693 --> 27:51.904
Then you know all about when he
served with the 82nd Airborne?

27:51.987 --> 27:53.489
Oh, nice try, Phillips.

27:53.614 --> 27:55.782
He was never with the 82nd.
He was with the First Army.

27:55.866 --> 27:58.785
He rotated out twice and did a third
stint during the fall of Saigon.

27:58.869 --> 28:01.246
I just don't know
what to believe anymore.

28:01.413 --> 28:03.916
This is a very special person.

28:03.999 --> 28:06.293
She just might be
out of your class.

28:06.418 --> 28:08.879
I also know about a two-bit
lieutenant named Phillips...

28:08.969 --> 28:11.055
that my dad met on
leave in Bora Bora.

28:12.716 --> 28:13.884
Cover 'em.

28:17.596 --> 28:20.140
Now, these guys have the rest of the
files my father's been waiting for.

28:20.165 --> 28:21.753
That's the reason I've
come all the way down here.

28:21.778 --> 28:23.042
Well, that's what we need.

28:31.902 --> 28:33.195
Freeze!

29:09.314 --> 29:11.024
B.A., get some rope
and tie 'em up.

29:11.650 --> 29:13.610
Lady, you are full of surprises.

29:13.777 --> 29:15.529
Stoddard's daughter.

29:15.612 --> 29:16.738
Oh, I just said that.

29:16.863 --> 29:18.490
I realize that.

29:19.032 --> 29:21.952
I've lost it. I
mean, the magic is gone.

29:22.035 --> 29:26.665
I, of all people, should be able to
see through a con artist. No more.

29:26.832 --> 29:30.794
You guys, you may as well just put me up
on blocks, let kids throw rocks at me.

29:30.919 --> 29:33.338
No, take it easy, Face.
It's just that she's good.

29:33.505 --> 29:36.008
What are you giving him sympathy for?
One problem at a time.

29:36.091 --> 29:38.844
He can go back to LA and brush
up with extension courses.

29:38.927 --> 29:40.596
I'm the one with trauma here.

29:40.762 --> 29:41.597
Ready, Hannibal.

29:41.722 --> 29:43.223
Okay, let's move out.

29:44.516 --> 29:46.310
I'd ask you to join us...

29:47.477 --> 29:49.354
but I'm not sure
which side you're on.

29:49.479 --> 29:53.817
See, you're a busload of people, and
we don't feel like playing driver.

29:57.070 --> 29:59.323
All right, I'm gonna come clean.

29:59.489 --> 30:00.782
Well, this should be good.

30:00.949 --> 30:02.242
I'm with the CIA.

30:02.326 --> 30:05.037
I'm losing it.
I'm just losing it because--

30:05.120 --> 30:08.415
You hold on, I'll hold on. We'll get to
Richter. He'll take care of this whole thing.

30:08.498 --> 30:10.626
Look, how do you think I knew
all about Stoddard's campaigns?

30:10.709 --> 30:12.502
How do you think I knew
how he met Phillips?

30:12.628 --> 30:15.589
What do you think I was doing at
Richter's house when you guys arrived?

30:15.756 --> 30:17.633
These guys busted in, I said
I was Richter's daughter.

30:17.716 --> 30:19.968
When you knocked on the door,
I had to stay in character.

30:20.302 --> 30:22.679
I went the journalist route when
you cracked my daughter rap.

30:22.763 --> 30:26.975
Lady, even if I bought the idea you
were with the CIA, we'd still pass.

30:27.059 --> 30:29.061
See, we don't do business
with the company.

30:29.144 --> 30:32.105
They've got this strange idea
that we're not the good guys.

30:32.189 --> 30:34.232
Well, look, I know you're the good guys.
You've proven that to me.

30:34.316 --> 30:36.985
And what I need you to do
is help me get through this.

30:38.945 --> 30:42.199
Look, what else
would I be doing down here?

30:42.407 --> 30:44.701
Beats me. Tie her up.

30:45.285 --> 30:47.537
Do you know what you're doing?

30:47.663 --> 30:50.999
Look, you know who I am! I'm with the CIA!
This is ridiculous!

30:51.166 --> 30:55.170
Oh, come on! Look,
I helped you guys escape!

30:55.295 --> 30:56.838
And we can't
thank you enough, ma'am.

30:56.922 --> 31:00.967
Now you just relax, and we'll be
back and get you in a little while.

31:01.259 --> 31:02.386
Let's mount up, guys.

31:02.469 --> 31:05.555
I'm an agent, I
have been sent down here.

31:05.806 --> 31:10.352
You let me go.
You guys are in big trouble!

31:34.292 --> 31:35.711
Tell me about it.

31:36.044 --> 31:38.296
El Presidente's
called a cease fire.

31:38.797 --> 31:39.965
Damn.

31:40.632 --> 31:42.259
He's ready to form
a coalition government...

31:42.384 --> 31:44.594
and get rid
of all the US forces.

31:45.429 --> 31:47.681
Not in this lifetime, he won't.

31:48.223 --> 31:49.266
He gets away with this...

31:49.349 --> 31:51.685
then guys like you and me
haven't got a lot to do, do we?

31:56.231 --> 31:58.567
We go after El Presidente.

32:00.610 --> 32:02.779
We break the cease fire
ourselves.

32:04.322 --> 32:08.660
We'll snuff that dude. There's
still plenty of war left.

32:18.503 --> 32:20.547
That's him, that is him!

32:24.176 --> 32:26.386
Stoddard's got
about a dozen men with him.

32:26.595 --> 32:28.597
I'm just so glad he's alive.

32:31.600 --> 32:32.809
Okay.

33:28.824 --> 33:31.409
Oh, God! How could I
have been so stupid?

34:34.639 --> 34:36.181
Intruders!

35:15.305 --> 35:16.598
Far enough!

35:27.776 --> 35:29.903
Just like you said, baby.

35:59.182 --> 36:01.351
They found us about
a half-hour after you left.

36:01.434 --> 36:04.062
They were gonna kill me,
so I gave up you guys.

36:04.187 --> 36:05.480
I told them about the attack.

36:05.647 --> 36:07.023
Save it for your book.

36:08.817 --> 36:10.443
Doc, wake up, Doc.

36:10.902 --> 36:12.070
Wake up!

36:12.779 --> 36:13.822
Is that you, Murdock?

36:13.989 --> 36:16.491
I'm not late for
my weekly session, am I?

36:17.075 --> 36:20.787
You were just about
to answer the question.

36:20.996 --> 36:23.498
Boy, you never
stop pressing, do you?

36:24.708 --> 36:27.752
My God, that's Sarah.
Sarah Teesdale.

36:27.836 --> 36:30.296
Sarah? Lied to again.

36:30.380 --> 36:31.673
You know this woman?

36:31.798 --> 36:33.008
She's my client.

36:33.133 --> 36:35.051
Client? A client?

36:35.844 --> 36:37.804
You trying to tell me a client
goes to all the trouble...

36:37.887 --> 36:40.098
to come down here
to try to find a psychiatrist?

36:40.223 --> 36:44.853
She came to me for help. Though I
have my doubts about her motives.

36:44.978 --> 36:46.229
Join the club.

36:46.438 --> 36:48.273
Visiting time at the zoo.

36:49.315 --> 36:51.234
Stoddard,
you're quite a character.

36:51.401 --> 36:53.445
Regular recruiting poster.

36:53.945 --> 36:58.533
Hiding out here in the bushes playing
Bomba, the Jungle Boy, acting like God.

36:58.616 --> 37:02.746
Doesn't your ego get a little
squeezed in these wide open spaces?

37:04.080 --> 37:05.665
Hey, sucker, you gonna pay.

37:05.749 --> 37:06.833
I'm shaking.

37:06.916 --> 37:08.752
Stoddard, there's something
I wanna tell you.

37:08.918 --> 37:12.922
Careful. She does impressions.
She's got more faces than a crowd.

37:13.089 --> 37:14.674
My real name is Marisa.

37:14.924 --> 37:16.718
I lied to them
to protect my mission.

37:16.843 --> 37:19.679
I was born in this country, but I went
to live in America with my mother...

37:19.763 --> 37:22.515
after my father ordered her
killed if she didn't leave.

37:23.141 --> 37:25.185
They murdered her brother,
my Uncle Thomas.

37:25.310 --> 37:28.438
They didn't approve of his politics.
I've never forgotten.

37:29.481 --> 37:32.067
Now I've come back to see
that he's overthrown.

37:32.233 --> 37:35.570
El Presidente's daughter?
You expect me to believe that?

37:35.737 --> 37:37.447
You should've heard
what we had to believe.

37:37.572 --> 37:41.076
El Presidente has a brother,
never heard from in the media.

37:41.159 --> 37:43.036
What's his name,
where does he live...

37:43.203 --> 37:44.913
and how old is
his oldest daughter?

37:44.996 --> 37:46.498
This is a bonus question, Sarah.

37:46.581 --> 37:48.416
His brother Ernesto
died last year.

37:48.500 --> 37:51.336
Only three sons survive him.
Mario, Luis and Manuel.

37:51.461 --> 37:53.588
His wife Marguerita bore him
no daughters.

37:53.713 --> 37:55.173
Anything else?

37:56.674 --> 38:00.178
No, that's fine.
We have a new recruit.

38:02.597 --> 38:05.975
I cannot believe
you used us this way!

38:10.522 --> 38:13.858
Later. When we come back,
you can waste him yourself.

38:14.651 --> 38:18.279
I'll tell you this, she's not
El Presidente's daughter.

38:18.404 --> 38:19.948
You're sure this time?

38:20.657 --> 38:21.991
Oh, yeah.

38:26.121 --> 38:29.124
I knew there was something groovy
deep down inside that girl.

38:29.165 --> 38:32.669
Doc, if she's your patient,
answer one question for me.

38:32.794 --> 38:33.920
Who is she?

38:34.003 --> 38:38.174
From time to time, everybody.

39:07.120 --> 39:08.413
Get out!

39:21.968 --> 39:24.637
We have to search the camp
for ammunition and arms.

39:24.679 --> 39:26.431
Anything, we can use anything.

39:26.598 --> 39:27.682
Man's talking like
he's got a plan.

39:27.807 --> 39:29.017
You sure we can do this?

39:29.225 --> 39:31.769
No, but I got great instincts.
Come on, Doc.

39:52.207 --> 39:53.583
Look at this.

39:54.083 --> 39:56.169
Look at this!

40:39.712 --> 40:40.964
Rockets.

40:42.382 --> 40:43.841
How would we launch them?

40:46.094 --> 40:47.679
We'll find a way, Doc.

41:49.073 --> 41:50.992
They gotta stop in town
for reinforcements.

41:51.075 --> 41:52.869
If we leave now,
we're in business.

41:58.249 --> 42:00.001
You know, Murdock...

42:00.793 --> 42:03.588
I have always had
complete trust in you.

42:03.921 --> 42:06.591
I don't believe a word
you're saying.

42:33.159 --> 42:34.410
Tell me when.

42:35.912 --> 42:36.996
Now!

44:19.182 --> 44:21.851
Now who's
in the basket, Stoddard?

44:22.393 --> 44:24.061
Throw down your weapons!

44:31.569 --> 44:35.573
There's no percentage. Let's see
you kick up some dust, Stoddard.

44:41.579 --> 44:46.042
You know, Murdock, I'm glad
I'm not the only fraud.

44:46.375 --> 44:48.544
Are you a doctor,
or aren't you a doctor?

44:49.795 --> 44:51.714
I'll see you
at the next session.

44:56.969 --> 44:58.763
Well, guys, I just
don't know what to say.

44:58.888 --> 45:00.973
Good. Then maybe
I'll enjoy my meal.

45:02.099 --> 45:05.394
Since this is the
last day in the house...

45:05.519 --> 45:07.688
the owner being due back
from Paris and all...

45:07.772 --> 45:11.442
I figured, why not take full
advantage of the facility?

45:11.609 --> 45:14.153
A gourmet luncheon. Couldn't
be a better way to say thanks.

45:14.178 --> 45:15.129
How about money?

45:15.154 --> 45:18.658
Well, I thought about that, B.A.,
but it struck me as crass.

45:18.741 --> 45:23.204
You know, considering that you guys
risked your lives to save my shrink...

45:23.287 --> 45:26.832
and get my emotional
shock absorbers back.

45:27.166 --> 45:29.919
So all that I can give you...

45:30.544 --> 45:32.964
is my heartfelt thanks.
- How about money?

45:33.047 --> 45:37.426
I can't help but wonder, was
Betty an agent of the CIA...

45:38.052 --> 45:41.013
a journalist,
Stoddard's daughter...

45:41.097 --> 45:42.974
Richter's patient,
Richter's daughter...

45:43.099 --> 45:45.059
El Presidente's daughter?
Did I leave anything out?

45:45.142 --> 45:49.230
Well, only that Stoddard's got a long time
in a cell to work on that one himself.

45:49.355 --> 45:52.900
I think she's a nut. Pure and simple.
And out to drive everyone else nuts.

45:52.984 --> 45:57.530
No, she was a woman with a highly
developed sense of adventure.

45:57.905 --> 46:01.075
She was a gourmet
of the grandiose...

46:01.200 --> 46:02.743
a belle of the bizarre.

46:02.910 --> 46:04.954
In other words, she was
a woman worthy of my respect.

46:05.037 --> 46:09.917
Whoever she was, I'd say she was just
a very insecure, frightened girl...

46:09.959 --> 46:12.044
and I for one
feel very bad for her.

46:12.378 --> 46:13.379
I think so.

46:13.462 --> 46:14.422
Okay.

46:16.340 --> 46:20.469
So if your bosses at the studio
approve this $12 million budget...

46:20.553 --> 46:22.346
I think we can nail down Burt.

46:22.513 --> 46:24.849
Anything to get
your picture going, darling.

46:25.016 --> 46:25.933
Betty?

46:26.100 --> 46:27.210
Marisa?

46:27.235 --> 46:28.528
Sarah?

46:29.937 --> 46:32.189
Betty? Marisa? Sarah?

46:32.356 --> 46:34.859
I just have
one of those faces, hmm?
