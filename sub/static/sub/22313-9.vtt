00:02.185 --> 00:03.669
<i> Last time</i>
<i>on</i> Superstition...

00:05.080 --> 00:07.840
Calvin and I have agreed
to figure us out before
we involve you.

00:08.025 --> 00:09.633
I'm offering you
an ear and comfort.

00:09.826 --> 00:11.301
<i>Come on!
This is your sanctuary.</i>

00:11.495 --> 00:13.387
<i>It's a place just for you.</i>

00:13.572 --> 00:17.057
I think me and my pals
are doing just fine.

00:17.243 --> 00:20.978
<i>No matter what, parents</i>
<i>protect their children</i>
<i>from monsters.</i>

00:21.505 --> 00:22.521
Bea!

00:22.706 --> 00:23.480
You know what we got?

00:23.673 --> 00:24.982
What do we have?

00:26.285 --> 00:26.942
We have that magic
life square
I always talk about.

00:27.052 --> 00:30.529
- One leg is health.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:30.714 --> 00:33.615
One leg is wealth.

00:33.725 --> 00:35.993
- The most important is love.
- Uh-huh.

00:36.612 --> 00:37.494
Last is?

00:37.687 --> 00:38.454
Time.

00:38.947 --> 00:40.122
Time.

00:40.232 --> 00:42.458
I know that smile of yours.

00:43.693 --> 00:44.634
Huh?

00:44.694 --> 00:49.298
It's not every day we get
"me and you" time.

00:49.458 --> 00:51.341
No infernals to fight.

00:52.536 --> 00:54.136
No services to perform.

00:56.740 --> 00:58.307
No kids interfering.

01:00.135 --> 01:02.269
I see those mimosas
have stirred up a little

01:02.454 --> 01:03.228
mischief in you.

01:06.883 --> 01:09.068
You'll see how much mischief
when I get you inside.

01:13.223 --> 01:15.574
The lock's upside down.

01:15.759 --> 01:18.327
There is an old wives' tale
that doing so keeps

01:18.436 --> 01:19.912
evil spirits
from entering the home.

01:20.989 --> 01:22.664
But who flipped it?

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:00.437 --> 02:01.954
Nothing but Huey.

02:02.139 --> 02:04.039
That cat didn't flip
the lock.

02:04.149 --> 02:04.873
No!

02:05.984 --> 02:07.668
But a cooler cat did.

02:09.821 --> 02:11.547
Uncle Bubba!

02:11.707 --> 02:14.466
But y'all look like Bonnie
and Clyde comin' in
here, man.

02:15.660 --> 02:16.844
How you doing?

02:20.498 --> 02:22.307
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

02:22.493 --> 02:23.308
Just everything.

02:27.631 --> 02:29.606
Ignore Issac!
He's just playing.

02:29.799 --> 02:31.233
None of that
French stuff in here, okay?

02:31.343 --> 02:32.234
Okay.

02:32.344 --> 02:33.694
Now you know what I want.

02:33.879 --> 02:35.404
We gotta make a do
with a dude.

02:35.513 --> 02:37.406
You best to give it me
or I'm gonna
have to take it.

02:37.515 --> 02:38.907
Oh, no!

02:40.235 --> 02:40.909
Already know what it is.
Uncle Bubba
just wanna make sure.

02:41.920 --> 02:42.619
- Measure twice, cut once.
- Okay, okay.

02:42.812 --> 02:45.080
Twenty-six, I'm feeling it.

02:45.857 --> 02:47.166
Hello, 26!

02:49.745 --> 02:52.504
All right, all right!
You up, Buttercup!

02:53.248 --> 02:54.356
Buttercup?

02:54.416 --> 02:57.634
Okay, Uncle Bubba,
maybe enough
with the tape, okay?

02:57.827 --> 02:59.386
Okay. I get it, I get it.

02:59.571 --> 03:00.888
Y'all wanna challenge
Uncle Bubba.

03:01.073 --> 03:02.973
Tapeless it is. Cool, cool.

03:03.166 --> 03:05.517
Now come on here and let me
see what's up all up
in there...

03:05.703 --> 03:09.188
Let me see.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:09.373 --> 03:10.939
Man, if I do this
you gonna owe me, right?

03:11.049 --> 03:12.274
Yeah.

03:12.384 --> 03:15.277
Waist, 34, chest 42,

03:15.387 --> 03:17.529
inseam 35.

03:17.715 --> 03:19.072
You got me.

03:19.258 --> 03:21.033
Come on, bring it in,
bring it in.

03:21.218 --> 03:22.409
How you doin'?

03:24.054 --> 03:24.357
He cannot stand this,
you know what I'm sayin'.

03:24.358 --> 03:24.661
Yeah, no, no.

03:25.556 --> 03:25.871
But I just love seein'
you guys.

03:27.115 --> 03:28.707
And little brother,
actually, it is good
to see you.

03:28.892 --> 03:29.833
You just...

03:30.026 --> 03:31.418
You caught us by
surprise, is all.

03:32.804 --> 03:33.962
Oh, y'all just wanna know
why this crazy negro
is in here.

03:34.072 --> 03:35.756
- No.
- Yes. Why is...

03:37.701 --> 03:38.842
Why are you here?

03:39.035 --> 03:40.552
I have a spiritual problem,

03:40.738 --> 03:43.639
that requires a particular
set of skills.

03:43.748 --> 03:47.267
The kind only my family
can provide.

03:47.453 --> 03:49.311
What's the problem
with your spirit?

03:49.421 --> 03:51.104
Mine is a dandy, Bea.

03:52.657 --> 03:54.399
It's the evil one that
follows me around,
is a whole bucket of bad.

03:56.328 --> 03:57.069
That evil clock...

03:58.497 --> 04:02.199
Well... So thoughtful of you
to leave that evil spirit
to us.

04:02.392 --> 04:04.493
I knew you guys
will understand.

04:10.233 --> 04:14.419
Only Uncle Bubba can put
that smile on Garvey's face.

04:14.605 --> 04:17.172
I'm gonna have a big old
smile on my face.

04:17.281 --> 04:20.132
Once I bounce his crazy ass
back where he belong.

04:20.319 --> 04:21.510
He's not crazy.

04:22.412 --> 04:25.514
Eccentric, OCD.

04:25.674 --> 04:27.724
Acutely superstitious but...

04:27.917 --> 04:28.784
Ultimately harmless.

04:28.844 --> 04:31.728
And he knows how to get
on my last nerve.

04:31.921 --> 04:33.855
Hey, the man
adores you.

04:33.965 --> 04:36.692
Show Uncle Bubba
a little kindness.

04:36.852 --> 04:38.277
I'll make
it worth your while.

04:39.471 --> 04:42.322
I was gonna make it
worth your while,

04:42.508 --> 04:43.865
before he showed up.

04:45.101 --> 04:46.827
You can still.

04:48.271 --> 04:49.955
After you help Uncle Bubba.

04:54.778 --> 04:56.169
I'll be upstairs.

04:57.947 --> 04:58.714
Bea!

05:02.619 --> 05:03.427
Tick-tock!

05:06.623 --> 05:08.265
That is no fair.

05:09.667 --> 05:10.851
Check this out right here.

05:11.036 --> 05:12.644
Oh, my God.

05:12.830 --> 05:14.771
Uncle, this is beautiful.

05:14.964 --> 05:18.650
You know, I was gonna send
it two-day postage,
but it woulda been $13.13,

05:18.836 --> 05:21.111
and three-day would
have been $6.66,

05:21.304 --> 05:23.363
so I thought it would be
best if I just bring it
to you myself.

05:23.549 --> 05:25.907
That's, uh...
Cautious of you.

05:26.068 --> 05:28.493
Do you feel me?
'Cause the Druid says

05:28.679 --> 05:31.163
those numbers
will make you have
very bad nightmares.

05:31.348 --> 05:33.665
Uncle Bubba is an expert
on global superstitions,

05:33.851 --> 05:35.250
and an incredible tailor.

05:35.410 --> 05:36.460
- Thank you.
- Uncle?

05:37.412 --> 05:38.628
-Yeah?
-Wanna see
if he measures up?

05:38.822 --> 05:40.756
Girl, I was thinking
the same thing.

05:40.865 --> 05:42.424
Good God almighty...

05:43.827 --> 05:43.859
He can tell if we're
a good match,
through our measurements.

05:44.586 --> 05:45.510
I call it the measure
of love.

05:46.196 --> 05:47.012
Yeah, it's a science.

05:47.939 --> 05:49.097
Come on, let me look
at ya, man.

05:49.207 --> 05:52.768
Shoulder to wrist
is a perfect 36.

05:52.877 --> 05:54.311
All right,
normal on the chest.

05:54.504 --> 05:56.396
That can be something
to worry about.

05:56.582 --> 05:58.148
He's got
an impressive inseam,

05:58.341 --> 06:00.108
and not
for a white boy neither.

06:00.218 --> 06:03.111
Now had I said,
"For a white boy..."

06:03.221 --> 06:04.988
That would have
been racialistic.

06:05.181 --> 06:06.740
But I said not.

06:06.925 --> 06:08.742
He's sizing up
to be a perfect match.

06:08.927 --> 06:10.243
We are?

06:10.429 --> 06:12.537
You got a
14-inch neck there, Russell.

06:12.723 --> 06:14.706
You should be proud
of that shit.

06:14.892 --> 06:16.416
And confident.

06:17.895 --> 06:17.967
See, why don't the rest
of your family see me
the way he does?

06:18.787 --> 06:19.878
You know what I'm thinking,
baby girl?

06:20.805 --> 06:22.506
I'm thinking
paisley and pleats.

06:25.569 --> 06:30.305
I'm gonna get right on it
after I rid myself
of that evil-ass clock,

06:30.415 --> 06:33.100
which is harmless unless you
touch it the wrong way.

06:33.285 --> 06:35.894
I'm a magnet for
all things paranormal.

06:36.079 --> 06:38.355
I've been struck
by lightning
47 times so far.

06:38.548 --> 06:41.900
I can feel it coming though.
Gives me a chance
to get my feet planted.

06:42.085 --> 06:44.444
You gotta get your
feet right
when lightning come.

06:44.630 --> 06:48.865
Because if you don't, Lord,
cancel Kwanzaa.

06:49.058 --> 06:51.201
It's been a minute though,
so I'm probably due.

06:51.394 --> 06:53.286
And that particular
devil right there

06:53.472 --> 06:55.580
keep finding
its way back to me.

06:55.766 --> 06:58.792
It's a prison that holds
an angry ghost,

06:58.977 --> 07:00.627
that just won't leave me be.

07:02.814 --> 07:04.381
Okay, don't touch it.

07:04.574 --> 07:07.717
Okay? 'Cause you gotta
get some salt,
a lavender candle

07:07.911 --> 07:09.970
and a goat's horn,
and don't even look at it.

07:10.155 --> 07:10.679
Okay.

07:12.749 --> 07:14.099
I'm digging this dude.

07:14.284 --> 07:17.310
I mean, 47 times
stuck by lightning...
Come on.

07:17.496 --> 07:19.938
I'm sure
there's nothing wrong
with this clock either.

07:20.123 --> 07:22.190
Is that a raven or a crow?

07:22.300 --> 07:23.984
Russ, we actually probably
shouldn't touch that.

07:45.782 --> 07:47.841
I don't even wanna know.

07:49.786 --> 07:51.511
Well, hey there, Chief!

07:51.697 --> 07:52.971
Hey, yourself!

07:54.658 --> 07:56.766
I have set up my phone
to give me an alert

07:56.960 --> 07:58.894
anytime Garvey's phone
gets near Russ' car.

08:00.055 --> 08:01.480
- Russ?
- Russ.

08:01.665 --> 08:02.898
Good old Russ!

08:03.007 --> 08:03.565
I don't know about that kid.

08:03.725 --> 08:05.233
He's not a bad kid.

08:05.343 --> 08:07.736
I knew guys like Russ
when I was in the service.

08:07.845 --> 08:09.613
They all look at women
like some hill to climb.

08:09.806 --> 08:12.115
At one point, wasn't I
that hill for you?

08:12.308 --> 08:13.617
- More like a mountain.
- Yeah.

08:13.810 --> 08:15.410
- More like a mountain.
- I climbed it though.

08:15.520 --> 08:16.495
Oh, my God!

08:18.240 --> 08:20.040
I fully embrace
this double standard.

08:20.225 --> 08:21.458
You do.

08:21.651 --> 08:23.418
But she still shouldn't
be with him.

08:23.528 --> 08:24.794
You should shut it down.

08:24.988 --> 08:26.463
Oh, yeah.

08:27.932 --> 08:29.841
Remember when my parents
tried that with us?
Worked flawlessly.

08:30.027 --> 08:31.259
I persisted.

08:32.437 --> 08:33.886
Russ isn't exactly
my first choice for Garvey,

08:35.440 --> 08:36.806
but he does make her feel
like a normal kid
and that's important too.

08:37.708 --> 08:39.851
For your lovely date.

08:40.037 --> 08:41.770
Thank you,
but this is not a date.

08:42.597 --> 08:43.938
Deny all you want,

08:44.048 --> 08:46.942
but I'm an expert
on such matters.

08:47.051 --> 08:50.153
The look in your eyes
says it all.

08:50.346 --> 08:53.782
Personally, I wouldn't argue
with an expert.

08:53.891 --> 08:55.909
But if this isn't
a date,

08:56.094 --> 08:58.036
then I only have to pay
for one meal, right?

08:58.221 --> 08:59.913
Wrong, very wrong!

09:00.523 --> 09:01.581
Thank you.

09:03.192 --> 09:04.133
You tried it.

09:04.193 --> 09:06.503
You know, this might
not be a date but...

09:06.696 --> 09:09.381
The chemistry
is certainly undeniable.

09:09.566 --> 09:13.635
We are two old friends
who fell into the familiar.

09:13.795 --> 09:15.303
Is that what we're
calling it now?

09:15.413 --> 09:16.471
Cute.

09:16.581 --> 09:20.016
Classic case
of sparks versus emotion.

09:20.209 --> 09:23.061
Do I even wanna know
what that alert means
for our daughter?

09:23.246 --> 09:25.689
Actually, you are
off the hook, this is work.

09:25.882 --> 09:28.984
Some big guy in a derby
and a plaid suit

09:29.093 --> 09:30.986
got all freaked out and
started running around
the place backwards

09:31.095 --> 09:33.697
because a black cat
crossed his path.

09:33.890 --> 09:35.198
Who does that?

09:35.391 --> 09:37.450
I just don't understand.
I do not understand.

09:37.636 --> 09:39.619
Where could they go?
Where did the kids go?

09:39.805 --> 09:41.204
-And Garvey
left her dress, man...
-Bubba!

09:41.397 --> 09:43.039
Bubba,
calm down now, okay?

09:43.232 --> 09:45.917
Now I want you to tell us
why you think
you're being haunted.

09:46.103 --> 09:47.460
Someone brought it to me.

09:47.646 --> 09:49.421
It was sent to me
by this weird clockmaker.

09:49.606 --> 09:51.715
Ah, you calling somebody
else weird. You hear that?

09:51.908 --> 09:54.884
Okay, Uncle Bubba,
we are doing whatever
we can. We're trying.

09:55.078 --> 09:56.761
But Garvey wouldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

09:56.947 --> 09:58.179
She's a teenager, Bubba!

09:58.289 --> 10:00.390
You barely get a hello
or a goodbye out of her.

10:00.583 --> 10:03.184
All right, she probably just
was in a hurry
and she'll be right back.

10:03.294 --> 10:04.853
Well, check the cars.

10:04.962 --> 10:05.937
- Really?
- Yes.

10:10.669 --> 10:11.735
Checking the cars.

10:11.928 --> 10:13.486
All right, Bubba,
you got us.

10:13.672 --> 10:15.614
This is what we're doing
with our day now.

10:15.799 --> 10:16.865
So, help us help you.

10:16.974 --> 10:18.450
Tell me about
this damn clock.

10:18.635 --> 10:19.784
Okay, I'll tell you what...

10:19.970 --> 10:21.202
When this clock
was restarted,

10:21.363 --> 10:25.332
not only did the spirit stay
here, it got attached
to me.

10:25.517 --> 10:27.167
It got attached to you?

10:27.352 --> 10:29.044
-Yes.
-Bubba, if we can't
prove it,

10:29.153 --> 10:30.587
how we gonna help you out?

10:31.948 --> 10:33.214
And if we can't help you
out, then you know
what time it is?

10:33.375 --> 10:34.323
What time is it?

10:34.450 --> 10:36.760
Time to get your ass
back to Shadybrook.

10:36.953 --> 10:38.762
Oh, not until
we get this fixed first.

10:38.955 --> 10:39.471
- Bubba!
- Russ!

10:40.382 --> 10:41.130
Garvey!

10:45.002 --> 10:46.478
The cars are still here,

10:46.663 --> 10:48.229
but there is
no sign of them.

10:55.972 --> 10:57.072
Uh-oh!

10:57.181 --> 10:58.990
Uh-oh, what?

10:59.176 --> 11:00.408
They're in that clock.

11:01.477 --> 11:02.827
What?

11:03.013 --> 11:04.412
They must have touched it
the wrong way.

11:04.522 --> 11:05.789
I told them not to do it.

11:05.982 --> 11:07.290
Kids today!

11:30.173 --> 11:31.439
Oh, Russ!

11:31.599 --> 11:33.441
Did you have
to touch that clock?

11:33.601 --> 11:34.734
Where are we?

11:34.920 --> 11:36.486
Well, take a guess.

11:36.679 --> 11:38.655
- I don't know.
- We're in the clock,

11:38.848 --> 11:41.157
or some sort of
clock dimension.

11:41.350 --> 11:45.120
That's impossible!
Garve, people can't just
go into clocks.

11:45.280 --> 11:46.663
Yeah, tell that to my mom.

11:46.856 --> 11:48.206
She spent a few days
in a mirror.

11:48.391 --> 11:49.207
What?

11:49.784 --> 11:51.376
Look, forget it.

11:51.561 --> 11:52.794
We just gotta get
the hell out of here.

12:02.297 --> 12:03.263
What the hell?

12:04.632 --> 12:05.724
Look,

12:07.543 --> 12:08.435
there's a door.

12:10.138 --> 12:11.271
Give me my phone.

12:17.553 --> 12:18.611
No service.

12:22.725 --> 12:24.200
I guess
that's the way to go.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.663
Oh, no.

12:33.495 --> 12:34.836
Garve!

12:47.250 --> 12:49.017
Oh, Garve!

12:49.177 --> 12:51.895
This is amazing. I mean,
we could sell these clocks.

12:52.088 --> 12:53.021
You might see spooky,

12:54.257 --> 12:55.106
but I'm a visionary,
'cause you know what I see?

12:56.200 --> 12:58.151
Hamilton staring at me
from 20-dollar bills.

12:58.336 --> 12:59.760
Andrew Jackson's
on the 20.

12:59.871 --> 13:02.739
Yeah, whatever. Plenty of
room for all the dead
white dudes in my wallet.

13:03.474 --> 13:05.241
Brilliant!

13:06.861 --> 13:08.578
Russ, we are definitely
in some supernatural space.

13:09.864 --> 13:12.332
If we are in a clock,
I mean...

13:12.517 --> 13:14.250
And fiddling with one got us
in here.

13:14.443 --> 13:16.878
Maybe we just need to fiddle
with the right one
to get us out, okay?

13:17.038 --> 13:19.881
- Um...
- Russ, Russ, Russ... Look.

13:20.041 --> 13:21.049
That could send us somewhere
really worse

13:21.209 --> 13:22.467
or trigger something
really bad.

13:22.652 --> 13:23.843
We just...

13:24.029 --> 13:25.845
We need to evaluate
our situation,

13:26.031 --> 13:27.305
feel our options
and go from there.

13:27.490 --> 13:29.474
How do you know this?

13:29.659 --> 13:32.685
Grandpa always said
the best decisions
are the informed ones.

13:33.814 --> 13:35.855
I'm guessing that's
the way to go.

13:36.041 --> 13:37.732
Wait a minute.

13:39.394 --> 13:39.466
You brought this into our
home and you're telling me
the kids are stuck in it?

13:39.744 --> 13:41.236
Yes.

13:43.973 --> 13:45.573
How do we get them out?

13:45.733 --> 13:48.034
Apparently, we're dealing
with a stage four
poltergeist here.

13:48.219 --> 13:49.828
Let's classify later,
Uncle Bubba.

13:50.013 --> 13:51.704
We need
to get the kids back now.

13:51.890 --> 13:53.873
Yeah, but in order
to get through this,

13:54.059 --> 13:54.916
we gotta find out

13:56.094 --> 13:57.293
which spirit or spirits
that are in this clock.

13:58.188 --> 13:59.462
You know what I am saying?
Because,

14:00.690 --> 14:01.297
one of them seems
not to be in
a very chatty mood.

14:02.325 --> 14:02.340
And the only reason
I stopped by here...

14:04.827 --> 14:06.928
...was to... Tagert...
The clock man...

14:07.088 --> 14:08.471
The clock repairman,
he made this.

14:08.664 --> 14:10.056
Tagert is the one
that sent you the clock?

14:10.241 --> 14:12.267
Yes. Or one of his minions.

14:12.427 --> 14:13.852
I thought it was a gift.

14:14.037 --> 14:15.270
Why?

14:15.430 --> 14:17.146
Hell, I don't know.

14:17.340 --> 14:19.065
I borrowed some money
from him,

14:19.250 --> 14:22.527
and I slept with his wife,
but what does that have
to do with him?

14:22.712 --> 14:25.238
Wait a minute,
wait a minute, you...
Wait a minute.

14:25.423 --> 14:26.547
My grandbaby is
in this clock

14:26.608 --> 14:28.575
'cause you couldn't keep it
in your big old pants?

14:28.760 --> 14:31.452
Hey, he wasn't embracing
none of his spousal duties.

14:31.613 --> 14:32.871
Naturally, I had to.

14:33.056 --> 14:33.997
Naturally?

14:34.190 --> 14:35.707
Yeah, but you know what
though?

14:35.892 --> 14:38.251
She went back
and told him everything.

14:38.436 --> 14:40.086
Man, like Dr. King said,

14:41.697 --> 14:43.464
"Bitches be tripping."

14:43.625 --> 14:47.552
Okay, I don't think
Dr. King ever said that.

14:47.737 --> 14:50.847
And Bubba, we're not gonna
refer to women that way
in this house.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.015
Thank you.

14:52.208 --> 14:53.391
I'm sorry.

14:53.576 --> 14:55.143
Okay, why don't you

14:56.712 --> 14:58.813
call May and have her scoop
up this Tagert guy
and bring him back here?

14:58.973 --> 15:01.608
And I'll continue to work
on contacting the spirit.

15:07.723 --> 15:10.241
Listen, just because
we fight like a couple
doesn't make us one.

15:10.427 --> 15:13.244
You just don't wanna admit
to what the rose lady
already knows.

15:13.430 --> 15:14.787
Yeah.

15:14.973 --> 15:16.915
A way to sell another
rose to another idiot.

15:23.773 --> 15:24.672
Thank you.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.741
Still, it's gonna die,

15:27.852 --> 15:30.303
it's gonna dry and
the petals are gonna
be blowing around

15:30.488 --> 15:32.722
with the wind and
we still have 16 years
of stuff

15:32.915 --> 15:34.390
we don't know about
each other.

15:34.583 --> 15:37.727
I mean, you're sexy, but
that still doesn't change...

15:37.920 --> 15:39.395
You do understand what
I'm trying to say, right?

15:39.588 --> 15:41.064
- Yes.
- Thank you.

15:41.257 --> 15:42.523
You think I'm sexy.

15:43.793 --> 15:45.693
- Oh, my God! You gotta
be kidding me.

15:45.853 --> 15:46.819
Hold on.

15:47.005 --> 15:49.906
Issac, hi! I am here
with your son, Casanova.

15:50.099 --> 15:51.324
What's up, Pop?

15:52.710 --> 15:53.993
<i>Hey, I need you guys to pick
up a man named Tagert.</i>

15:54.179 --> 15:55.745
What? Why?

15:57.440 --> 15:57.472
<i>He may have Garvey and Russ</i>
<i>captive in</i>
<i>an enchanted clock.</i>

15:58.883 --> 15:59.374
<i>Don't ask.</i>
<i>Just get over</i>
<i>to Edgewood Drive.</i>

16:01.110 --> 16:02.794
- On it.
- Turn right.

16:06.874 --> 16:08.007
Wait, Russ! Russ!

16:44.320 --> 16:46.254
- Garvey, come here...
- Wait, Russ...

16:47.340 --> 16:48.673
What the...

16:48.858 --> 16:50.258
Look at that!

16:50.418 --> 16:51.509
God! Don't...

16:56.516 --> 16:58.266
What did
I tell you?

16:58.426 --> 17:01.227
Did it ding because
I touched it?

17:01.929 --> 17:03.938
Oh, sorry!

17:04.098 --> 17:05.481
Just keep your hands
to yourself, all right?

17:07.435 --> 17:10.319
Okay, so, since the spirit
is tied to the clock,

17:10.512 --> 17:12.989
I constructed a Ouija board
in a paper plate

17:13.182 --> 17:14.615
as a means
to communicate with it.

17:14.776 --> 17:16.534
- That is clever, Bea.
- Thank you.

17:16.719 --> 17:18.411
This clock looks just like
the Wheel of Fortune,

17:18.596 --> 17:20.538
except the prize
could get the kids back.

17:20.723 --> 17:22.373
-Well, thank you
for that insight.
-Yeah, you're welcome.

17:22.559 --> 17:23.790
Okay, shh, shh!

17:26.287 --> 17:28.755
Help us, lost spirits.

17:28.940 --> 17:30.923
Tell us...

17:31.109 --> 17:32.383
Who are
we communicating with?

17:49.477 --> 17:51.027
Agnes!

17:51.220 --> 17:52.653
Agnes, that's her name.

17:52.814 --> 17:54.322
- Ask Angus...
- Agnes!

17:54.482 --> 17:56.199
Whatever.
Ask her her favorite color.

17:56.392 --> 17:58.076
Ask her
why she took the kids.

17:58.261 --> 18:00.953
Wait a minute,
I know this clock
and this clock knows me.

18:01.139 --> 18:03.581
I could have been giving it
my own command.

18:03.766 --> 18:06.167
I'm not commanding it,
Uncle Bubba,
I'm simply asking it.

18:06.327 --> 18:08.961
Come on, I got this.
Come on, come on.
I got this.

18:09.405 --> 18:10.671
Back up!

18:12.333 --> 18:13.633
What's up, Angie?

18:13.818 --> 18:14.926
It's the Bubster here.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.910
Look here.

18:17.021 --> 18:19.847
You snatched up two of
the kids and we need to be
with them right now.

18:33.854 --> 18:34.862
Hello!

18:40.144 --> 18:42.620
Angie may have
misunderstood me.

18:42.805 --> 18:43.871
Oh, you think?

18:44.031 --> 18:45.039
Garvey!

18:45.959 --> 18:47.208
Russ!

18:48.444 --> 18:49.836
No doors.

19:09.965 --> 19:11.149
What the hell is this?

19:17.473 --> 19:18.447
No service.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.974
What are you doing, man?

19:21.085 --> 19:24.912
It's a Mazuza-fix.
It's a cross
and a Mazuza hybrid,

19:25.072 --> 19:27.665
to dispel on
a cross spectrum

19:27.850 --> 19:29.750
between
that and your ring.

19:30.986 --> 19:33.212
Bubba, my ring is back
in the Alchemy room.

19:33.398 --> 19:34.589
What?

19:35.824 --> 19:35.856
We weren't planning to leave
the way we did, brother.

19:36.158 --> 19:37.758
Oh, man!

19:37.919 --> 19:39.093
You wanna know
what I think is going on?

19:39.253 --> 19:40.261
What's going on?

19:41.163 --> 19:42.763
I think your boy Tagert

19:42.924 --> 19:45.183
teamed up with
that evil spirit, Agnes,

19:45.368 --> 19:50.730
and they're using
this clock environment like
some kind of Venus flytrap.

19:50.915 --> 19:52.607
And you know
who they wanna trap, Bubba?

19:52.767 --> 19:53.816
- Who?
- You!

19:54.009 --> 19:55.109
And they got your ass.

19:56.287 --> 19:57.445
They got me, they got Russ
and they got Garvey,

19:58.681 --> 20:00.114
and our job is to get
those kids
and get outta here,

20:00.224 --> 20:01.407
as quickly as we can,

20:02.351 --> 20:03.910
by any means
necessary, Bubba.

20:04.095 --> 20:05.620
This is why I wore my
superstition jacket, baby!

20:05.780 --> 20:08.289
I got a rabbit foot,
I got crosses.

20:08.399 --> 20:10.458
I got soap, Greek isles.

20:10.618 --> 20:13.294
Yeah, and check this out.
Brass knuckles, with runes.

20:13.454 --> 20:14.587
You likey?

20:16.365 --> 20:17.924
- Runes, huh?
- Yeah.

20:21.370 --> 20:22.211
Yeah, I likey.

20:22.371 --> 20:24.263
I thought you would.

20:31.422 --> 20:34.106
I didn't wanna leave it
in the Alchemy room,
for obvious reasons.

20:35.217 --> 20:36.734
So, Uncle Bubba said that
and then...

20:36.919 --> 20:37.735
And then he...

20:37.920 --> 20:40.821
Commanded the clock
and they were both gone.

20:40.931 --> 20:42.323
- I know, it sounds...
- Perfect!

20:43.726 --> 20:44.784
Good riddance.

20:45.769 --> 20:47.912
No, no...
I just think she...

20:48.097 --> 20:50.248
I got it. I got it.

20:54.278 --> 20:56.587
Tagert, do I need to remind
you that you have four
people in that time trap

20:56.773 --> 20:57.630
you made?

20:58.574 --> 21:00.258
One of them happens
to be my daughter.

21:00.443 --> 21:02.093
Do you have enough
to arrest me?

21:02.278 --> 21:04.095
I think not,

21:04.280 --> 21:05.513
because you have rules.

21:06.582 --> 21:09.850
May, you thirsty?

21:13.922 --> 21:15.147
Yeah.

21:15.333 --> 21:17.692
Yeah, come to think of it,
I'm parched.

21:17.852 --> 21:20.111
Bea, do you have anything
that could help
with a light head?

21:20.296 --> 21:22.822
- Well, I got sweet tea.
- Sweet tea will be great.

21:28.788 --> 21:29.537
Let's take a walk.

21:30.481 --> 21:32.540
I see what this is.

21:32.700 --> 21:34.709
You two are playing
"good cop, black cop."

21:34.869 --> 21:36.210
But I'll tell you
the same deal, brother.

21:39.148 --> 21:41.007
This is not a game.

21:42.451 --> 21:45.678
And I am not your brother.

21:47.623 --> 21:50.558
My daughter and my father
are trapped in that clock.

21:50.667 --> 21:52.351
You gotta tell me
where they are.

21:52.537 --> 21:54.061
Here's something else
for you to consider.

21:54.221 --> 21:55.646
I'm not a cop.

21:55.832 --> 21:57.356
I have no rules.

21:57.542 --> 22:00.067
You're gonna tell me
where there are, Tagert.

22:00.177 --> 22:02.320
No, no, no!

22:02.505 --> 22:04.989
You need to tell me
where they are.

22:05.174 --> 22:06.365
No, we don't do this.

22:06.551 --> 22:07.408
We do not do this.

22:07.568 --> 22:09.744
No. Not today.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.039
Excuse us.

22:17.653 --> 22:19.152
This needs to be done, Ma.

22:19.263 --> 22:21.756
Now, it doesn't have to
happen under this roof,
but it needs to be done.

22:21.916 --> 22:23.841
- We are running out of time.
- Hush your mouth.

22:45.681 --> 22:48.074
Nice kitty, nice kitty!

22:48.701 --> 22:49.617
Stay away!

22:50.536 --> 22:52.370
Get him out!

22:52.555 --> 22:54.121
Just get this thing off me!

22:54.281 --> 22:55.456
Get it off!

22:55.566 --> 22:56.707
Please!

22:58.378 --> 23:00.211
What the hell?

23:09.913 --> 23:11.305
Well done!

23:14.376 --> 23:16.560
I thought you said
we don't...

23:16.746 --> 23:17.770
We don't do this.

23:18.731 --> 23:19.980
But Huey...

23:20.733 --> 23:22.274
That's a different story.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.449
We keep our focus.

23:30.635 --> 23:31.617
We have plans, adapt...

23:31.802 --> 23:32.593
We overcome.

23:32.653 --> 23:34.328
Yeah, as long as
that involves running.

23:40.402 --> 23:41.627
It's human.

23:41.812 --> 23:44.422
It's using human souls
for the clocks.

23:47.242 --> 23:48.175
- Oh, God!
- God!

23:52.581 --> 23:53.597
God!

23:57.252 --> 23:58.644
Oh, God!

23:59.922 --> 24:01.105
Hold on!

24:07.429 --> 24:08.696
Come here.

24:13.268 --> 24:15.703
Russ!

24:16.939 --> 24:19.457
Russ! Russ!

24:21.944 --> 24:23.043
Garvey!

24:23.153 --> 24:24.170
Go! Go!

24:25.447 --> 24:28.549
Russ. Come on...
Please, come up.

24:39.169 --> 24:40.561
Russ!

24:40.721 --> 24:42.563
Russ, come on,
you're so close.

24:42.673 --> 24:44.565
You're so close, Russ,
come on.

24:56.496 --> 24:57.578
Grandpa!

25:04.820 --> 25:06.378
Garvey!

25:09.700 --> 25:11.258
Mr. Hastings!

25:11.368 --> 25:12.510
Grandpa!

25:16.665 --> 25:18.349
Where did he go?

25:20.002 --> 25:21.185
Grandpa!

25:21.370 --> 25:22.686
Grandpa! Where are you?

25:23.505 --> 25:25.022
Exactly where I want them.

25:28.343 --> 25:29.443
Garvey!

25:30.679 --> 25:31.862
Russ!

25:39.539 --> 25:40.579
What are you, a cutter?

25:40.765 --> 25:41.789
Shut up, I need to focus.

25:56.738 --> 25:58.639
What was that with
that crazy X-Men stuff?

25:59.575 --> 26:00.140
You know the rumors
about my family,

26:00.818 --> 26:01.809
that I said were lies?

26:03.062 --> 26:03.894
Well, it's all true.

26:04.080 --> 26:06.730
Ghosts, infernals...
My family...

26:06.916 --> 26:08.232
We fight against all that.

26:08.417 --> 26:09.984
Whoa! Okay!

26:10.093 --> 26:12.570
Look, Russ, I know you must
have some questions.

26:12.755 --> 26:14.863
Some?
How did you do all this?

26:15.057 --> 26:16.824
Look, Russ, no time now.

26:16.984 --> 26:18.242
She's coming.

26:18.427 --> 26:19.493
I can't hold it forever.

26:19.653 --> 26:21.579
Do your X-Men thing then.

26:21.764 --> 26:23.455
I can't,
I'm getting too weak.

26:25.101 --> 26:27.334
Use me as like a boost.
Like, my energy. Like,
leveling up in a video game.

26:27.494 --> 26:28.752
I've never done that before.

26:30.614 --> 26:32.131
Maybe it's about that time.

26:52.594 --> 26:55.529
Garvey, Garvey, I got you.

26:57.432 --> 26:59.533
I feel it, she's gone.

27:00.453 --> 27:01.660
You did it.

27:02.145 --> 27:03.662
We did it.

27:03.848 --> 27:05.164
Come here. Come here.
It's okay.

27:05.349 --> 27:05.998
Come here.

27:06.942 --> 27:07.541
We're gonna get
out of here, okay?

27:08.218 --> 27:09.126
All right, follow me.

27:10.487 --> 27:11.837
Garvey!

27:12.489 --> 27:13.672
Russ!

27:13.858 --> 27:15.049
Am I a lost cause?

27:16.043 --> 27:17.217
Bubba!

27:17.378 --> 27:19.386
This is a maze, brother,
that's all.

27:19.546 --> 27:21.513
And there's always a way out
of a maze.

27:21.699 --> 27:24.224
Well, I mean this from the
heart. I never meant
to hurt Garvey and Russ.

27:27.629 --> 27:28.562
We're gonna
find them.

27:28.722 --> 27:30.189
Now, brother,

27:30.374 --> 27:32.399
you are a walking
encyclopedia for anything

27:32.559 --> 27:34.318
having to do
with superstition.

27:34.503 --> 27:37.529
We gotta take that energy,
that know-how, that smarts,

27:37.715 --> 27:39.406
and just apply it to getting
the kids back.

27:39.566 --> 27:40.324
Yeah.

27:40.509 --> 27:41.533
Hell, yeah!

27:45.522 --> 27:47.915
Agnes said she was cursed,

27:48.075 --> 27:51.669
and made into this clock,
and she now believes
she's God there.

27:51.854 --> 27:53.879
I outsourced that part,
but you can't make an omelet

27:54.064 --> 27:55.547
without breaking
some eggs.

27:55.733 --> 27:57.424
She is not the only spirit
banished in the clock!

27:57.584 --> 27:59.426
There are 83
others in here.

27:59.586 --> 28:00.844
It's a poltergeist trap

28:01.030 --> 28:02.429
for a reason.

28:02.589 --> 28:04.598
It snagged a lot of them

28:04.708 --> 28:06.350
because it's so well-made.

28:06.535 --> 28:08.102
Why? Why?

28:08.262 --> 28:10.104
For banging my wife.

28:12.766 --> 28:15.442
I wanted Bubba to receive
a warm welcome when
I caught him,

28:15.602 --> 28:18.779
so I projected my own
visions of evil from
my favorite horror movie.

28:18.889 --> 28:20.864
Okay, so all of that is
going on
in this little clock.

28:24.019 --> 28:27.621
Yes, and no.

28:27.781 --> 28:29.456
The clock launches them to
a dimensional space.

28:30.859 --> 28:32.793
Since I fed souls to Agnes,

28:32.953 --> 28:35.129
she sees me as her master.

28:35.238 --> 28:38.549
So asking her questions
would only confuse her.

28:38.734 --> 28:40.551
So ask, don't ask,
just get them the hell
out of there.

28:42.037 --> 28:44.888
Tilly picked the worst time
for a vacation.

28:45.074 --> 28:46.974
There may be some racket.
The lights may flash.

28:47.083 --> 28:48.100
But say nothing.

28:50.396 --> 28:53.731
Your master requires
your devotion,
obedience and...

28:58.887 --> 29:00.779
I guess his time ran out.

29:02.224 --> 29:04.158
One, two, three,
don't touch me.

29:04.267 --> 29:05.909
One, two, three,
don't touch me.

29:06.095 --> 29:06.660
One, two, three...

29:07.488 --> 29:07.953
Could you keep it
down, brother?

29:08.839 --> 29:10.122
One, two, three,
don't touch me.

29:10.307 --> 29:12.750
I gotta go do
my cleansing rituals.

29:12.935 --> 29:15.127
I have to rescue Garvey.

29:16.997 --> 29:18.505
Is that Garvey's blood?

29:18.665 --> 29:19.840
Or Russ.

29:26.915 --> 29:28.849
Left their breadcrumbs.
Look!

29:31.586 --> 29:32.519
Garvey!

29:35.131 --> 29:36.106
Russ!

29:40.354 --> 29:41.987
Hang in there, Garve,
hang in there.

29:46.434 --> 29:48.368
Futile.

29:48.478 --> 29:51.038
No one departs
without my consent.

29:51.773 --> 29:53.373
Hand over the girl,

29:53.534 --> 29:55.167
and I'll let you go.

30:09.141 --> 30:10.140
Screw yourself.

30:23.972 --> 30:27.241
Your mistrust of your father
is a waste of resentment.

30:27.401 --> 30:29.201
He is eternally dedicated
to you,

30:29.386 --> 30:30.577
and will never let you down.

30:30.687 --> 30:32.246
That's not the point.

30:32.355 --> 30:33.747
He still left me.

30:33.907 --> 30:36.083
- And my...
- And my mother.

30:36.192 --> 30:39.503
Guilt, regret, resentment,

30:39.688 --> 30:42.464
sadness, and all forms
of non-forgiveness

30:42.657 --> 30:44.424
are the cause of too
much past

30:44.585 --> 30:45.717
and not enough presence.

30:45.903 --> 30:49.680
When we allow ourselves
to miss the present moment,

30:49.865 --> 30:52.099
we miss the opportunities
of this life.

30:52.542 --> 30:53.934
Thank you.

30:56.856 --> 31:00.482
Are you, like,
my great-grandmother
or something?

31:01.009 --> 31:02.568
No.

31:02.753 --> 31:05.445
We are a lot closer
than you think.

31:05.606 --> 31:06.864
Russ, he is...

31:07.049 --> 31:09.491
He is pure at heart.
But his love

31:09.684 --> 31:12.035
and devotion to you
will be his end.

31:12.221 --> 31:13.745
Take care of him.

31:13.931 --> 31:15.706
His life is in
your hands, Garvey.

31:19.861 --> 31:22.087
<i>His life is in
your hands, Garvey.</i>

31:22.272 --> 31:24.381
<i>His life is in
your hands.</i>

31:32.082 --> 31:35.225
Russ! Russ!

31:35.411 --> 31:36.476
Oh, my God!

31:36.637 --> 31:38.061
Garvey!

31:38.247 --> 31:40.898
Garvey!
Help! Help!

31:41.083 --> 31:42.649
Why are you draining souls?

31:42.809 --> 31:44.151
To absorb them.

31:44.260 --> 31:47.237
This grandfather of yours
who comes for you...

31:47.889 --> 31:48.997
I want him.

31:49.057 --> 31:52.659
Carve a rune
onto this clock face
to draw him in.

31:52.819 --> 31:54.328
Right!

31:54.488 --> 31:56.163
Anything else
when I'm at it?

31:56.272 --> 31:57.664
You, I need alive.

31:59.275 --> 32:00.751
Not the boy.

32:00.936 --> 32:03.420
Oh, no, no!

32:03.605 --> 32:06.840
Care to see how fast
I can pierce his throat
with a second hand?

32:07.927 --> 32:10.052
Oh, no! Don't do it, please.

32:10.245 --> 32:11.261
Please!

32:11.447 --> 32:12.429
Okay.

32:13.248 --> 32:14.431
Okay, stop.

32:14.616 --> 32:17.059
Wise choice, now draw it.

32:19.254 --> 32:22.272
A false rune earns him
instant death.

32:25.760 --> 32:29.863
You think your grandfather
is immune because
he is immortal.

32:31.967 --> 32:34.034
The joke's on you, girl!

32:34.144 --> 32:37.371
That is exactly
why I want him.

32:37.531 --> 32:40.791
The fruit of the soul
lies within its experience,

32:40.976 --> 32:46.171
and this immortal is rich
with hundreds of years
of experience.

33:08.410 --> 33:10.445
What the hell is that
on your forehead?

33:15.402 --> 33:18.912
I feel like some kind of
spell is overtaking me.

33:19.072 --> 33:22.582
Oh, man. I'm telling you,
death ain't ladylike and
it's coming looking for me.

33:22.692 --> 33:24.459
I know it, I can feel it.
I feel it.

33:25.320 --> 33:26.420
We gotta keep moving.

33:32.202 --> 33:34.094
Grandpa,
she's coming
for you.

33:34.829 --> 33:36.179
Grandpa, I'm sorry.

33:36.365 --> 33:38.098
She made me carve the rune,
she was gonna kill Russ.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.767
Welcome, immortal!

33:40.927 --> 33:43.937
I sensed your presence
the moment you entered
my realm.

33:44.047 --> 33:48.483
A soul so rich in experience
will be deeply savored.

33:48.676 --> 33:50.402
Look out! She's
behind you, behind you!

33:51.054 --> 33:52.279
There's more.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.491
You can't stop all of us.

33:58.612 --> 33:59.460
She's multiplying!

33:59.521 --> 34:01.371
It's pointless,
immortal.

34:01.557 --> 34:03.790
Get it done, Buttercup.

34:03.900 --> 34:05.792
Issac, you looking
like Sugar Ray...

34:06.361 --> 34:07.836
Oh, Bruce Lee!

34:08.029 --> 34:09.670
Mr. Hastings, please!

34:09.864 --> 34:11.965
Look out behind you!

34:13.217 --> 34:15.302
What is happening
to you, I wonder?

34:15.411 --> 34:18.179
We're waiting on you right
now. Come and get us.
Come and get us.

34:18.373 --> 34:19.639
Come and get us.

34:20.893 --> 34:22.150
Struggle or no,

34:22.210 --> 34:25.562
this soul key will unwind
the immortal times
of your soul

34:25.746 --> 34:28.065
and give it all to me.

34:28.925 --> 34:30.317
Bea!

34:30.476 --> 34:32.235
Come and get us, right now.
We're waiting on you.

34:34.429 --> 34:38.492
It says, take the clock
to Alchemy room,

34:38.652 --> 34:39.826
moon mirror.

34:39.936 --> 34:40.952
Okay, let's go do that.

34:42.005 --> 34:43.163
No, if this were
from Isaac, I'd know.

34:43.273 --> 34:44.164
He'd make sure.

34:44.274 --> 34:45.581
We can't just assume.

34:45.766 --> 34:47.333
Whatever it's asking for,
it could be a trap.

34:47.443 --> 34:48.376
Wait, wait, wait.

34:55.594 --> 35:00.680
"We gotta do
that do, baby girl!"

35:00.841 --> 35:01.848
What is that?

35:02.008 --> 35:03.558
It's Uncle Bubba!

35:03.751 --> 35:05.352
Okay, now, we've gotta
get up there.

35:10.925 --> 35:13.193
Come on, Bea, we're waiting
on you. Bea!

35:13.353 --> 35:14.361
Bubba, the clocks!

35:14.470 --> 35:15.737
Hit the clocks!

35:15.930 --> 35:16.696
Oh!

35:16.806 --> 35:18.281
Oh, I guess...

35:18.467 --> 35:19.741
Yeah, yeah!

35:22.804 --> 35:24.287
No!

35:25.532 --> 35:27.749
No!

35:32.780 --> 35:34.131
Bubba, now!

35:37.118 --> 35:39.136
Come over here, grab my hand.
 Grab my hand.

35:39.321 --> 35:41.555
Plant your feet,
plant your feet!

35:50.340 --> 35:51.273
Hold on!

35:54.677 --> 35:55.986
They've got you, babe!

35:58.006 --> 36:00.240
Baby?

36:00.350 --> 36:01.741
Take your time.

36:02.810 --> 36:03.743
Breathe.

36:03.853 --> 36:05.453
Sit up. Take your time.

36:05.647 --> 36:06.580
I'm okay, baby.

36:08.191 --> 36:09.791
You got my message.

36:09.984 --> 36:12.085
- How about that, baby girl?
- Yeah.

36:14.915 --> 36:16.840
Uncle, how did you get us
out of there?

36:17.025 --> 36:19.634
Like Benjie Franklin said,

36:19.827 --> 36:24.556
"Lightning can be your
enemy but every now and
again it can be your boy."

36:24.741 --> 36:25.599
Amen to that.

36:25.759 --> 36:26.933
Yeah.

36:28.036 --> 36:30.103
Russ, so how does it feel
to help save 83 souls?

36:30.856 --> 36:32.606
Oh, well...

36:32.766 --> 36:37.986
Uh, you know, actually,
Ms. Hastings, I'm about it.

36:38.179 --> 36:40.655
You know, as you guys know,
I'm a man of action as I am.

36:40.848 --> 36:43.617
Oh, man!

36:43.777 --> 36:44.868
- Hey, Russ.
- What?

36:49.449 --> 36:50.790
That hurts!

36:50.900 --> 36:52.626
Oh, no, I'm not...

37:00.943 --> 37:04.429
I got to go, I got to go.
I got to go. I got to go.

37:05.982 --> 37:07.974
I know, I know, but you just
got to find a way to go on
without me.

37:08.084 --> 37:08.975
You know what I mean?

37:09.085 --> 37:11.311
All of my stuff is
at Shadybrooks.

37:11.421 --> 37:13.772
They make a great BLT.
But mostly...

37:13.957 --> 37:16.399
It is wonderfully boring,
you know what I'm saying.

37:16.585 --> 37:18.610
And I do wanna say,
as savior of the day...

37:18.795 --> 37:21.196
You did save the day,
but you know
it was your clock

37:21.389 --> 37:22.989
that got us in the mess
in the first place?

37:23.099 --> 37:24.783
I just wanna say something.

37:24.968 --> 37:27.744
Even though I have
all the lucky charms,

37:29.322 --> 37:32.499
brother, you got the best
one of all, family.

37:34.902 --> 37:35.794
Thank you.

37:37.113 --> 37:38.255
I got something for you.

37:38.440 --> 37:39.798
- Close your eyes.
- Bubba, I'm good.

37:39.983 --> 37:41.424
Close your eyes. No peeking.

37:41.610 --> 37:43.718
Bea, make sure
he do not look.

37:43.911 --> 37:46.012
Oh, man, hold your arms out,
hold your arms out.

37:46.122 --> 37:47.514
- Mmm-hmm.
- How about that?

37:47.623 --> 37:49.432
Put it on...
Yeah, we got you.

37:49.618 --> 37:50.558
Yeah... Mmm-hmm.

37:50.752 --> 37:51.726
Bea, don't let him peak.

37:51.919 --> 37:53.186
- I'm not.
- Okay.

37:53.296 --> 37:55.689
If something
happening crazy, Bubba...

37:55.798 --> 37:57.148
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm,
you're gonna love this.

37:59.093 --> 38:00.360
Now open your eyes.

38:02.022 --> 38:05.490
Now we can
be twinsies!

38:05.675 --> 38:09.077
Twinsies, just what
I always wanted, Bubba.

38:09.270 --> 38:13.164
Okay, let me run Uncle Bubba
back, and give us some
quality time together.

38:13.350 --> 38:14.541
Mmm-hmm.

38:15.777 --> 38:18.336
And in the meantime, you can
have some mimosas waiting,

38:19.113 --> 38:20.880
and nothing else. Hmm?

38:22.301 --> 38:24.301
But wait, wait...
Wait a minute.

38:24.486 --> 38:26.761
Russ drives for all of
them companies,
Uber, Lyft taxi,

38:26.954 --> 38:28.763
- Russ could take Bubba home.
- I'm gonna take... No.

38:28.956 --> 38:30.598
We could kill two birds
with one Bubba.

38:30.792 --> 38:33.310
No, I can drive Uncle Bubba,
thank you.

38:33.495 --> 38:38.523
Come here. Give it here.
Ah. Man,

38:38.708 --> 38:39.899
I appreciate everything.
Thank you.

38:40.009 --> 38:41.075
You're welcome, brother.

38:41.135 --> 38:45.697
All right, all right.
Gotta go. Let's go, Bea.

38:45.882 --> 38:47.032
Let's go.

38:47.809 --> 38:49.034
Take care of Buttercup.

38:49.811 --> 38:50.660
Buttercup.

38:51.354 --> 38:52.412
Buttercup.

38:55.241 --> 38:56.333
Let's go, Bea.

39:01.364 --> 39:02.630
Garvey?

39:05.418 --> 39:06.343
Russ?

39:15.002 --> 39:18.521
Look, I know I'm a freak.
Spent my whole life trying
to hide it from everyone,

39:18.707 --> 39:22.400
now you know.
So if it's too much,
I get it.

39:22.586 --> 39:24.694
I mean, if it was me
I wouldn't even wanna...

39:27.273 --> 39:30.116
I've always thought you were
the most unique girl
in this town.

39:30.226 --> 39:31.109
Today's just confirmed it.

39:33.855 --> 39:36.456
Forget about the thousand
questions I have.

39:36.566 --> 39:37.707
I have an answer for you.

39:39.569 --> 39:40.960
Didn't ask you
any questions.

39:41.070 --> 39:42.379
But you've gotta
be thinking it.

39:44.532 --> 39:47.926
Garvey, I'll keep
every secret

39:48.111 --> 39:51.054
that you ever trust me
to share, to my death.

39:59.714 --> 40:03.775
For letting me see you today
and making me a better guy,

40:03.960 --> 40:05.819
for the most part.

40:07.430 --> 40:09.447
Russ, it's beautiful.

40:27.241 --> 40:28.591
It's so small and delicate.

40:30.077 --> 40:32.470
When people ask you
where you got it from,

40:32.656 --> 40:35.723
only if down the road
you feel okay about it,

40:35.917 --> 40:37.725
maybe you could say
it's from me.

40:37.919 --> 40:42.397
You don't have to,
it's just if you want to
and... I don't...

40:52.767 --> 40:55.994
Hey. Sorry.

40:57.197 --> 40:58.746
She returns to the scene
of the crime.

40:58.940 --> 41:01.541
Sparks versus emotion,
the debate continues.

41:01.651 --> 41:03.418
Uh-huh. No, I'm not staying.

41:03.611 --> 41:06.421
Come on, we've been dancing
around this, Calvin.

41:06.614 --> 41:08.631
I'm really glad that you are
in Garvey's life,

41:08.817 --> 41:14.220
but whatever this is between
me and you has just been
happening way too fast.

41:14.330 --> 41:15.847
I should have never...

41:16.032 --> 41:17.348
Quit apologizing for any
of our moments.

41:18.718 --> 41:21.311
I'm grateful for them.

41:21.496 --> 41:27.650
You just... Now we have time
to figure it all out.

41:31.898 --> 41:35.408
Do you have any idea
what it's like
to be a single mother?

41:38.145 --> 41:44.626
I had her so young and
I lost myself in you
and then you left.

41:46.487 --> 41:48.713
And then I lost myself in
Garvey and now
she's finally...

41:48.898 --> 41:52.634
She's finally old
enough to where I have
a second to try to...

41:52.827 --> 41:54.344
To find May again.

41:55.847 --> 41:59.390
Or are you afraid
I'll leave again?

41:59.576 --> 42:01.809
If I don't do this now,
or at least try to,

42:02.003 --> 42:04.687
I'm just... I'm not gonna
be any good to anybody.

42:10.845 --> 42:12.153
I understand.

42:15.275 --> 42:17.534
I won't pester you
anymore then.

42:17.719 --> 42:20.870
I don't want you to sit
waiting for me
to come around.

42:21.056 --> 42:23.331
I think you should just
go ahead
and live your life, Calvin.

42:29.530 --> 42:30.922
As you wish.

42:35.128 --> 42:36.094
Bye.
