00:07.800 --> 00:10.701
Um...

00:10.740 --> 00:12.708
Take your time.

00:12.740 --> 00:14.537
(phone rings)

00:14.580 --> 00:16.241
Do you have to get that?

00:17.580 --> 00:20.242
It might be my campaign office.

00:21.320 --> 00:23.311
Hello.

00:24.550 --> 00:26.211
Hello?

00:26.260 --> 00:28.251
Hi, Mrs. Florrick.
This is Michael Browning

00:28.290 --> 00:30.326
from Fiscal One. How are you
doing today-- pretty good?

00:30.360 --> 00:31.657
I'm not interested, thank you.

00:31.690 --> 00:33.328
Do you know
you might be paying more

00:33.360 --> 00:35.191
in monthly credit fees
than you should be?

00:35.230 --> 00:38.097
Thank you. Good-bye.
Sizable sav...

00:39.400 --> 00:41.061
Everything
all right?

00:41.100 --> 00:43.159
Yes. Uh, I'm sorry, um,

00:43.210 --> 00:44.802
what was the question again?

00:44.840 --> 00:47.172
The names _of some friends
I can InterVIew?

00:47.210 --> 00:49.144
Just to get a fuller picture?

00:53.420 --> 00:55.115
Can I have a think on that?

00:55.150 --> 00:58.847
Sure. Um, why
don't we turn to...

00:58.890 --> 01:01.108
Will Gardner?

01:01.160 --> 01:03.151
I think it might be a nice
place to start your memoir.

01:03.190 --> 01:05.249
A brush with violence, you
know? And then we go back

01:05.290 --> 01:08.259
to when you got
started in the law.

01:09.700 --> 01:11.691
to find a
structure here.

01:27.620 --> 01:29.542
(phone rings)

01:31.690 --> 01:33.419
Hello.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.587
WOMAN: Hello, Mrs. Florrick,
how are you doing today?

01:35.620 --> 01:37.349
Thank you, I'm not interested.

01:37.390 --> 01:39.426
I am calling from
the Cancer Prevention League.

01:39.460 --> 01:41.451
Thank you, good-bye.

HI, how was school?

02:34.620 --> 02:37.316
Good. M-Mom,
what are you doing?
Nothing.

02:37.350 --> 02:39.454
I just thought we'd grab
some pizza tonight.

02:39.490 --> 02:40.957
Oh, I'm just dropping off
my books. Janine's already

02:40.990 --> 02:43.322
downstairs. I have
college prep tonight.
Oh, right, I forgot.

02:43.360 --> 02:44.384
I'm gonna grab a bite
beforehand. I'll be back

02:44.430 --> 02:46.250
by 11:00.
Okay. Love you.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.791
Oh, and there's a package
by the door. Love you, too.

Hello, Mrs. Solomon.

03:09.420 --> 03:10.387
I wanted to thank you

03:10.420 --> 03:13.309
for your $345 contribution.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.282
Thank you for your $100
contribution,

03:15.320 --> 03:18.483
Mr. Turgensenton-tonkrenlun.

03:18.530 --> 03:19.827
I'm angry, too.

03:19.860 --> 03:21.259
But I want you to know...

03:21.300 --> 03:23.825
(click)

03:23.870 --> 03:26.395
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.897
* You and me both, kid.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.369
Hello, Mr. Tatro?

03:34.410 --> 03:36.241
MAN: Yeah, who's this?

03:36.280 --> 03:38.009
Uh, this is Alicia Florrick,
and I want...

03:38.050 --> 03:40.473
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
it's her. Babe, it's Alicia.

03:40.520 --> 03:41.714
WOMAN: What?

03:41.750 --> 03:43.581
Uh, I wanted to call
and thank you, sir.

03:43.620 --> 03:46.384
MAN: We pretty much gave up.
I called you 30 times.

03:46.420 --> 03:48.388
Can you do it, Alicia?
C-Can you help?

03:48.420 --> 03:50.957
Uh... I'm-I'm sorry, Mr. Tatro,

03:50.990 --> 03:53.424
I think there's...
might be some confusion here.

03:53.460 --> 03:55.451
I'm just calling you
to thank you for your donation.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.798
I didn't make
a donation, Alicia.

03:57.830 --> 04:00.537
I kept leaving messages
at your campaign office because

04:00.570 --> 04:02.504
I couldn't get you at work.

04:02.540 --> 04:04.030
Brett Tatro?

04:04.070 --> 04:06.038
Yes.

04:06.070 --> 04:08.334
Attempted murder.
Yes.

04:08.380 --> 04:09.779
You got me off six years ago.

04:09.810 --> 04:11.778
I was the bouncer at
the strip joint.
Yeah.

04:11.810 --> 04:14.017
I-I'm sorry, I-I didn't
know who you were.

04:14.050 --> 04:15.517
Alicia,

04:15.550 --> 04:17.017
I was arrested four months ago

04:17.050 --> 04:18.381
on first-degree murder charges.

04:18.420 --> 04:19.819
Oh, my God,

04:19.860 --> 04:21.885
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, well, it's the same case,

04:21.920 --> 04:23.649
Alicia. It's the same case.

04:23.690 --> 04:25.453
What do you mean
it's the same case?

04:25.490 --> 04:27.390
I mean the same case
you got me off for--

04:27.430 --> 04:29.398
they're trying me again.

04:29.430 --> 04:31.569
They can't do that, Brett.
You were found not guilty.

04:31.600 --> 04:32.737
Jeff died.

04:34.700 --> 04:37.498
The man they said that I punched
in 2009, he-he just died.

04:37.540 --> 04:39.428
They said it doesn't matter
that you got me off

04:39.480 --> 04:41.539
for attempted murder.

04:41.580 --> 04:45.004
I can now be tried for murder.

04:45.050 --> 04:47.848
Alicia, I... I need your help.

04:47.880 --> 04:50.519
Brett, I...

04:50.550 --> 04:52.654
Let me get you the name
of a good lawyer.

04:52.690 --> 04:54.817
No, wait, no, you're
a good lavwer.
No. I-I mean,

04:54.860 --> 04:57.385
yes, but I'm not
practicing law anymore.

04:57.430 --> 04:59.079
Alicia, I'm going
to court tomorrow.

04:59.130 --> 05:00.597
Just... Just come by
and observe?

05:00.630 --> 05:02.564
I have a good lawyer
for you, Brett.

05:02.600 --> 05:05.569
Let me talk to him,
I will call you back.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.558
Wow.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.602
(indistinct conversations)

05:23.490 --> 05:26.459
Are we incognito?

05:26.490 --> 05:29.687
We are. Laying low.
Thanks for coming.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.459
No problem.

05:31.490 --> 05:32.855
So this case--
it's an old client.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.458
It's really unjust.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.764
After six years, they're
going after him for murder.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.768
I don't know if I can take
the work load, Alicia.

05:38.800 --> 05:41.769
I'm deep in two mail
fraud trials right now.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.859
But you
should do it.

05:43.910 --> 05:45.502
Oh, no. I...

05:45.540 --> 05:46.802
I'd do more harm than good.

05:46.840 --> 05:48.831
What? Why?

05:51.580 --> 05:54.708
Um, because I'm busy
with this memoir, and...

05:56.180 --> 06:00.389
And...
I'm... Well, I'm having...

06:00.420 --> 06:05.426
a crisis of confidence, and
it's taking up all my time.

06:05.460 --> 06:06.722
I see. So it
probably wouldn't help

06:06.760 --> 06:08.796
to tell you to get back
on the horse, then?

06:08.830 --> 06:11.594
It's just different
when you're embarrassed

06:11.630 --> 06:13.894
and everyone's staring at you.

06:13.940 --> 06:16.602
For what?

06:16.640 --> 06:18.062
The election.

06:19.710 --> 06:22.099
Well, here's the good news.

06:22.140 --> 06:23.869
You're not that important.

06:23.910 --> 06:26.617
People aren't
staring at you. People

06:26.650 --> 06:29.483
are way too busy getting
on with their lives, okay?

06:29.520 --> 06:32.080
So... do it.

06:32.120 --> 06:33.656
Help this guy. He
needs your help.

06:33.690 --> 06:35.817
Stop thinking about
yourself, and

06:35.860 --> 06:39.455
think about him.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.627
I can't take another failure.

06:41.660 --> 06:43.491
Mm.

06:43.530 --> 06:45.760
Oh, well, then
don't fail.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.165
We asked for the record...
The defense would like...

06:47.200 --> 06:48.565
...of the earlier trial.
...the transcripts. If I

06:48.600 --> 06:50.158
could finish--
Your Honor,

06:50.210 --> 06:51.905
this is a travesty.
The defense attorney
is arguing

06:51.940 --> 06:53.669
double jeopardy, but

06:53.710 --> 06:55.075
Mr._Tatro is not
beIng accused

06:55.110 --> 06:56.577
of the same crime.
Your Honor, ifI could speak.

06:56.610 --> 06:58.646
In 2009 we needed
to prove that Mr. Tatro

06:58.680 --> 07:02.639
had a specific intent to
kill Mr. Jeffrey Garrix.
And they failed.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.908
They did not...
But now the charge is first-
degree murder, and we don't

07:04.950 --> 07:07.714
need to prove intent.
This is an injustice. My father

07:07.760 --> 07:10.923
is a... _Excuse me.
My-My client IS a father

07:10.960 --> 07:13.724
of three. He's not a criminal.
I can't see what that
has to do with the charge,

07:13.760 --> 07:17.025
Your Honor. In 2009,
Mr. Tatro viciously

07:17.070 --> 07:19.459
and repeatedly punched
and kicked a young man,

07:19.500 --> 07:21.661
putting him into a coma.
A coma he recovered from.

07:21.700 --> 07:23.463
And now that young man has died

07:23.510 --> 07:25.000
_ due to_ those
Injuries In 2009.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.577
Okay, thank you both.

07:27.610 --> 07:30.579
Is this your first
criminal trial, Ms. Audrey?

07:30.610 --> 07:33.545
It is, Your Honor. But it
doesn't have to be

07:33.580 --> 07:35.741
if you rule against
the prosecution.
(Dunaway chuckles)

07:35.780 --> 07:38.715
Unfortunately, ASA Brody
is right on the law.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.786
This is not double jeopardy.
So we'll commence

07:40.820 --> 07:42.629
pretrial motions tomorrow.

07:42.660 --> 07:44.025
(gavelbangs)

07:44.060 --> 07:47.223
Oh, Alicia.
Thank you.

07:47.260 --> 07:49.592
I'm just here to check it out,
Brett, that's all.

07:49.630 --> 07:51.598
Uh, you remember
my wife Josie?
Oh,

07:51.630 --> 07:53.495
yes, hi. I didn't know
you got married.

07:53.540 --> 07:54.734
Five years ago.

07:54.770 --> 07:57.204
Three little girls.
They're adorable.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.879
_ Wouldn't even exist
If you hadn't gotten me off.

07:59.910 --> 08:03.107
Can you believe I'd be halfway
through my sentence right now?

08:03.150 --> 08:05.675
Six years into a
12-year sentence.
What did you think about Amber?

08:05.710 --> 08:08.144
Your lawyer? Good.

08:08.180 --> 08:10.717
She's a little nervous.
She couldn't get
a word in edgewise.

08:10.750 --> 08:12.286
Well, Matan can be rough
on new lavwers.

08:12.320 --> 08:13.856
He was that way with me.

08:13.890 --> 08:15.209
I was just as nervous.

08:15.260 --> 08:16.852
But you won.

08:16.890 --> 08:19.029
MATAN:
Alicia.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.091
Excuse me for a minute.

08:25.230 --> 08:26.891
I didn't know you were
on this, Alicia.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.158
I'm just here observing,
that's all.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.758
It should be more interesting
this time around.

08:30.810 --> 08:33.870
Not so easy to win.
Really? Why's that?

08:33.910 --> 08:35.639
There's a hole in your case.

08:35.680 --> 08:38.877
A hole? What hole?

08:38.910 --> 08:40.673
(short chuckle)
You know, hey,

08:40.720 --> 08:42.585
sorry about the election.

08:42.620 --> 08:45.714
People can be mean at first,
but they'll forget soon enough.

08:45.750 --> 08:48.014
A few months, it'll be like
it never happened.

08:48.060 --> 08:49.823
Just like Peter.

09:00.670 --> 09:03.867
Okay, let's get started.

09:20.320 --> 09:21.685
(phones ring)

09:21.720 --> 09:24.826
_ Alicia?
HI, how are you?

09:24.860 --> 09:26.122
Good,

09:26.160 --> 09:28.025
actually, thank you.

09:28.060 --> 09:29.925
Uh, this is a business call.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.369
What business?

09:31.400 --> 09:33.698
Do you remember Brett Tatro?

09:33.740 --> 09:35.833
Attempted murder.
We fought it our first year.

09:35.870 --> 09:37.269
He called here a few times,
but we don't

09:37.310 --> 09:38.834
take cases like that anymore.

09:40.680 --> 09:43.843
Well, I need, uh,
the file on the case. Uh,

09:43.880 --> 09:44.949
I don't want
to go through David Lee

09:44.980 --> 09:46.299
and deal with the usual hassle.

09:46.350 --> 09:48.011
Are you representing him,
Alicia?

09:49.050 --> 09:50.688
Iam.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.779
Well, that's...

09:52.820 --> 09:54.879
that's... that's great.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.184
Sure, I'll get the files over.
Where?

09:57.230 --> 09:58.879
Oh, just to my apartment.

09:58.930 --> 10:01.296
Oh. Right.
You... Your apartment.

10:01.330 --> 10:02.968
And, Cary,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.298
do you remember if there was
a hole in that case?

10:05.330 --> 10:06.866
Anything we missed
in the defense?

10:06.900 --> 10:09.835
No, but it was
a long time ago. Why?

10:09.870 --> 10:12.998
Matan seems to think _
there's a hole he can exp|0It.
Well,

10:13.040 --> 10:14.803
my guess is you'll
find it in the files.

10:14.840 --> 10:16.808
We were completists back then.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.239
Took notes on everything.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.271
Thanks.

10:22.420 --> 10:24.615
(heavy scraping)

10:28.460 --> 10:30.849
* Ready to bolt

10:30.890 --> 10:34.257

* That's not_ mine
(doorbell rIngs)

10:40.470 --> 10:43.268
* Clocking the hours
that spin round *

10:43.310 --> 10:45.904
* Through the tail end

10:45.940 --> 10:48.807
* There's gold
in those hills ahead *

10:50.850 --> 10:54.240
* We both had a hand in it

10:59.290 --> 11:02.657
* You and me both, kid

11:05.130 --> 11:07.894
* You and me both, kid

11:10.470 --> 11:13.667
* You and me both, kid...

11:15.740 --> 11:18.106
ALICIA:
Sorry, do you mind
ifI record this?

11:18.140 --> 11:19.937
I just don't
want to miss anything.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.436
BRETT:
Uh, no. Sure, sure.

11:21.480 --> 11:22.947
So how's this work again?

11:22.980 --> 11:24.447
ALICIA:
Well,

11:24.480 --> 11:27.813
Stern, Lockhart & Gardner
offer a certain number

11:27.850 --> 11:30.318
of associate hours
to pro bono cases lIke yours.

11:30.350 --> 11:32.955
Free of charge.
Well, I didn't do it.

11:32.990 --> 11:34.309
I didn't beat that guy up.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.850
ALICIA: Jeff Garrix?
BRETT: Yeah, him.

11:35.890 --> 11:37.858
I didn't lay a hand on him.

11:37.890 --> 11:40.154
ALICIA:
Um, where did you meet him?

11:40.200 --> 11:43.226
Was it at the nightclub?
No, it was, uh, it was
earlier than that.

11:43.270 --> 11:46.489
Dakota had a bachelor party
at the Sheraton. 12 guests.

11:46.530 --> 11:48.839
ALICIA: Jeff Garrix was there?
BRETT: Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am,

11:48.870 --> 11:51.839
he thought that they had paid
for topless and bottomless,

11:51.870 --> 11:54.304
so I had to explain
to him the rules.
ALICIA: And he got angry?

11:54.340 --> 11:56.479
Yeah. Silly college kid.
So

11:56.510 --> 11:59.843
then he followed you back
to the Pink Sapphire?

11:59.880 --> 12:01.973
BRETT:
Yeah, Dakota left behind
some business cards.

12:02.020 --> 12:03.942
ALICIA:
And that's where you got
in the fight with him

12:03.990 --> 12:05.287
in the parking lot?
BRETT: Nah, nah,

12:05.320 --> 12:06.912
I wasn't in the parking lot.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.951
The police said they
arrested you for fighting him

12:08.990 --> 12:10.958
in the parking lot.
Yeah, I mean, I know. But like

12:10.990 --> 12:12.252
I told them,
I wasn't there.

12:12.290 --> 12:13.848
Well, where were you?

12:13.900 --> 12:14.992
I was with Lexie.

12:20.970 --> 12:24.508
ALICIA:
The tape recorder is just
to aid me in my note-taking.

12:24.540 --> 12:26.167
LE_XIE:
Sure. AnythIng you need.

12:26.210 --> 12:28.906
You want some water?
No, thank you.

12:28.940 --> 12:30.999
So, um...
(wolf whistles)

12:31.050 --> 12:32.915
...you were with Brett
during the fight?

12:32.950 --> 12:35.111
Oh, yeah. In my
dressing room.

12:35.150 --> 12:36.811
I wasn't feeling
so good that night.

12:36.850 --> 12:38.989
So...

12:39.020 --> 12:41.318
you're that lady with
the husband, right?

12:41.360 --> 12:44.022
ALICIA:
That's kind of vague.

12:44.060 --> 12:45.459
LEXIE:
Yeah, um, I mean

12:45.490 --> 12:48.050
the guy in jail.
With the prostitutes.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.864
Iam.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.868
I thought that was
pretty cool--

12:52.900 --> 12:54.037
you standing
by him.

12:54.070 --> 12:56.493
Thank you.
So, anything else, Lexie?

12:56.540 --> 12:57.939
Anything
about Brett?

12:57.970 --> 12:59.437
Just that he's innocent.

12:59.470 --> 13:01.938
And you'll testify to that?
Definitely.

13:01.980 --> 13:04.107
It's my du...
(click)

13:06.110 --> 13:07.975
ALICIA:
Now, Brett, if you weren't in
the parking lot fight,

13:08.020 --> 13:10.011
how did you get these
bruises on your face?

13:10.050 --> 13:11.187
All right, from-from
Jeff Garrix.

13:11.220 --> 13:13.017
But at the Sheraton.

13:13.060 --> 13:15.551
We got in a fight over whether
he had just topless or not.

13:15.590 --> 13:17.126
DIANE:
Alicia,

13:18.860 --> 13:20.122
do you have a moment?

13:20.160 --> 13:22.151
ALICIA:
Yes, of course.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.122
Thank you, Mr....
(static)

13:24.170 --> 13:26.126
(click)

13:26.170 --> 13:29.230
(phone ringing,
indistinct conversations)

13:29.270 --> 13:31.238
DIANE: _
You've probably notIced

13:31.270 --> 13:33.500
_ a lot of this firm
Is about cooperatIon.

13:33.540 --> 13:36.134
We're a family here,
and we like to work together.

13:36.180 --> 13:38.068
Now, I know you two
are in competition,

13:38.110 --> 13:40.169
and competition is
always a healthy thing,

13:40.220 --> 13:44.042
but I want you to work on
this pro bono case together.

13:44.090 --> 13:45.842
The Brett Tatro case.
I'm already

13:45.890 --> 13:47.152
deep into it, Ms. Lockhart.

13:47.190 --> 13:49.249
Yes, and Cary will be
your second chair.

13:49.290 --> 13:51.178
Use him as your
stalking horse.

13:51.230 --> 13:53.858
That's how we
improve. Okay?

13:53.900 --> 13:56.198
Is there anything
either of you want to say?

13:56.230 --> 13:57.925
No.

13:57.970 --> 13:59.267
All good.
Same here.

14:02.340 --> 14:04.331
You take
the other bouncer-- Daniel.

14:07.310 --> 14:08.971
Yeah, I'll take
Jeff Garrix, too.

14:09.010 --> 14:10.443
He won't talk
to the defense.

14:10.480 --> 14:13.608
He might...
if it's the right defense.

14:16.620 --> 14:19.418
GARRIX:
My lawyer told me
not to talk to you.

14:19.450 --> 14:22.157
Said you'd just try and distort
what I say in court.

14:22.190 --> 14:25.284
KALINDA:
Well, do I look like
someone who would do that?

14:25.330 --> 14:26.991
(Garrix chuckles)

14:27.030 --> 14:28.998
So, how are your legs?

14:29.030 --> 14:31.897
It's my spine. Your client
kicked me in the back,

14:31.930 --> 14:33.488
almost crippled me
for life.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.189
What's your name?

14:35.240 --> 14:37.208
Kalinda.
Kalinda what?

14:37.240 --> 14:38.969
Kalinda none
of your busmess.

14:39.010 --> 14:42.207
Brett Tatro said
that you also had an encounter

14:42.240 --> 14:44.174
at the Sheraton
prior to the parking lot.

14:44.210 --> 14:45.438
Oh, really?
How convenient for him.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.641
He has to explain away
his bruises somehow.

14:47.680 --> 14:51.047
So you're saying there was no
fight earlier in the evening?

14:51.090 --> 14:53.012
I wasn't even
in the room with him.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.311
It was a suite.

14:54.360 --> 14:57.659
Some of us were watching
football in the bedroom.

15:00.960 --> 15:03.360
MAN:
We don't really allow bachelor
parties in here anymore.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.561
It was one of the last ones.
Because of the ﬁght?

15:05.600 --> 15:07.465
And all the noise.
The guests complained.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.434
I had to come down here
and send them out,

15:09.470 --> 15:11.131
and told them to go
to their strip joint,

15:11.170 --> 15:13.070
if that's really what
they wanted to do.

15:13.110 --> 15:14.236
Where's the TV?

15:14.280 --> 15:15.702
We don't have one in here

15:15.740 --> 15:17.241
while we're switching
to flat screen.

15:17.280 --> 15:18.440
CARY:
Was there a TV in here

15:18.480 --> 15:20.175
on the night
of the bachelor party?

15:20.220 --> 15:21.619
MAN:
No.

15:21.650 --> 15:23.538
Garrix couldn't have been
watching football on TV,

15:23.590 --> 15:25.182
because there was no TV.

15:25.220 --> 15:27.017
You're sure?

15:27.060 --> 15:28.413
Positive.

15:28.460 --> 15:29.984
Okay, good.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.588
And get the stripper, too.

15:31.630 --> 15:34.098
The one who went
to the bachelor party.
Dakota.

15:34.130 --> 15:36.223
Yeah. Get her to confirm
that there was no TV.

15:36.260 --> 15:38.728
Good. I will.
KALINDA:
Oh, and, Alicia,

15:38.770 --> 15:41.466
write this down-- 1219 Berkoff.

15:41.500 --> 15:44.333
ALICIA:
Okay, got it. What is it?

15:44.370 --> 15:46.099
It's where
I'm buying you drinks tonight.

15:46.140 --> 15:47.607
ALICIA (laughs):
You don't have to do that.

15:47.640 --> 15:49.335
I was just doing my job.

15:49.380 --> 15:52.372
KALINDA:
8:00 p.m., 1219 Berkoff.

15:56.720 --> 15:59.518
Let go!
No!

15:59.550 --> 16:02.587
(both laughing)

16:19.270 --> 16:21.272
(truck horn honking on tape)

16:21.310 --> 16:23.369
DAKOTA:
Yeah, the bachelor

16:23.410 --> 16:26.140
party started out fine, but
it got kind of touch-and-go.

16:26.180 --> 16:27.340
And did you see the victim,

16:27.380 --> 16:29.268
Jeff Garrix,
in the bedroom?
Mm-hmm.

16:29.320 --> 16:31.242
Was there a TV.
Was he watching
a TV there?

16:31.290 --> 16:32.587
No, 'cause there
wasn't a TV.

16:32.620 --> 16:34.383
CARY:
Okay, good,
great. And

16:34.420 --> 16:36.388
when the bachelor party
followed you back here,

16:36.420 --> 16:39.150
there was a fight
in the parking lot, right?
Yeah.

16:39.190 --> 16:40.293
But Brett wasn't_ there 'cause
he was takIng care

16:40.330 --> 16:41.627
of a sick Lexie, right?

16:43.430 --> 16:46.024
Well, I know
that's what Brett said.

16:47.300 --> 16:49.291
Are you saying
that's not true?

16:49.340 --> 16:52.400
Well, I don't want
to hurt Brett.

16:52.440 --> 16:54.305
Let me stop you
right there, Dakota.

16:54.340 --> 16:56.308
Alicia, why don't we just...
why don't we turn off the tape?

16:58.510 --> 17:00.717
(tape clicks off)

17:02.120 --> 17:04.315
CARY:
Now,

17:04.350 --> 17:06.284
I don't know what
you were gonna say, Dakota,

17:06.320 --> 17:07.810
but I want to tell you,

17:07.860 --> 17:09.384
Brett's whole defense
is his alibi.

17:09.420 --> 17:11.388
You, of course, should
testify to the truth.

17:11.430 --> 17:13.091
Just know that if you
contradict Brett's alibi,

17:13.130 --> 17:14.290
it might hurt him.

17:14.330 --> 17:16.298
You want me to say

17:16.330 --> 17:19.219
Brett's telling the truth?
No.

17:19.270 --> 17:20.737
I want you to be careful

17:20.770 --> 17:23.034
in your understanding
of what you might say.

17:24.370 --> 17:26.531
ALICIA:
Cary, you can't do that.

17:26.570 --> 17:28.276
Do what?
Tell her to lie.

17:28.310 --> 17:29.504
I didn't tell
her to lie.

17:29.540 --> 17:31.098
I told her about
the consequences

17:31.150 --> 17:32.378
of her actions,
that's all.

17:32.410 --> 17:34.173
Oh, come on.
Are you serious?

17:34.220 --> 17:35.744
She was about
to contradict Brett's alibi.

17:35.780 --> 17:37.338
We don't know that.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.415
This is not the way
I want to practice the law.

17:39.450 --> 17:41.281
Oh, what, you
mean successfully?

17:41.320 --> 17:43.584
So, what if
the prosecution gets to her?

17:43.630 --> 17:45.359
They won't.

17:45.390 --> 17:46.584
We have an
aIIbI WItness.

17:46.630 --> 17:49.292
That's all we need.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.622
There's the hole.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.396
It's not Dakota anymore.

17:56.440 --> 17:59.409
It's Dani._
Sorry, DanI.

17:59.440 --> 18:00.771
I just have
a few questions.

18:00.810 --> 18:02.675
Not pink.

18:02.710 --> 18:04.348
What is she, a wedding cake?

18:04.380 --> 18:06.405
You're doing very well.
Yeah.

18:06.450 --> 18:08.839
Saved up my money
from those two years dancing.

18:08.880 --> 18:12.486
By the way, no one here knows
that I used to do that,

18:12.520 --> 18:13.680
so let's keep
it quiet?

18:13.720 --> 18:15.312
What do you need?

18:15.360 --> 18:17.225
_ You know Brett's _
beIng prosecuted agaIn?

18:17.260 --> 18:19.228
I heard. I'm sorry.

18:19.260 --> 18:22.229
Has the prosecution
approached you about that night?

18:22.260 --> 18:23.796
No. Why? Will they?

18:23.830 --> 18:27.368
They might. They think there
was a hole in our last defense.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.493
And I know you had some...

18:29.540 --> 18:31.667
hesitation about
Brett's alibi.

18:31.710 --> 18:33.337
You're wondering
if I'll contradict his alibi?

18:33.380 --> 18:35.871
No, I just want
to lay out the consequences

18:35.910 --> 18:38.470
for contradicting Brett
and Lexie's alibi.

18:38.510 --> 18:40.614
Don't worry
about it.

18:40.650 --> 18:44.211
I see no upside
to dredging up my past

18:44.250 --> 18:46.389
in any shape or form.

18:46.420 --> 18:48.513
Give me a minute, will you?

18:48.560 --> 18:51.552
Of course, Dakot... Dani.

18:52.830 --> 18:55.390
Here's the thing.

18:55.430 --> 18:59.526
I may not be a problem,
but did you hear about Lexie?

18:59.570 --> 19:00.889
No. What?

19:00.940 --> 19:02.896
She died...
four years ago.

19:02.940 --> 19:05.465
Drug overdose.
Really sad.

19:05.510 --> 19:08.399
Maybe that's the hole
in the defense.

19:11.850 --> 19:13.408
MATAN:
I'll drop the charge
to second-degree.

19:13.450 --> 19:14.815
That's the
lowest I'll go.
Come on.

19:14.850 --> 19:16.442
The victim could have died

19:16.480 --> 19:17.708
for any one
in a million reasons.

19:17.750 --> 19:19.945
32 years old, he dies
from a brain hemorrhage

19:19.990 --> 19:22.413
doctors can tie directly
to that fight in 2009.

19:22.460 --> 19:24.758
Matan, you lost six years ago.
Get over it.

19:24.790 --> 19:27.395
I have a stronger
case this time.
Because Lexie's dead?

19:28.560 --> 19:30.289
I don't need Lexie.

19:30.330 --> 19:32.764
I have her testimony from 2009.

19:32.800 --> 19:35.189
Then reject my deal.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.359
What do you have, Matan?

19:38.410 --> 19:40.799
What I have is some advice
for you.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.637
You go to trial, you'll lose.

19:42.680 --> 19:45.706
That's first-degree
murder, 20 years minimum,

19:45.750 --> 19:48.378
serving every
single day.

19:49.850 --> 19:52.410
I'll see you in court.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.195
(indistinct chatter)

20:09.270 --> 20:11.659
AMBER:
HI,

20:11.710 --> 20:14.338
Mrs. Florrick.
I am such a fan.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.529
I'm so glad you'll
be joining me.

20:15.580 --> 20:17.343
Oh, thank you.
I'm glad, too.

20:17.380 --> 20:18.506
I told my mom I'd be
working with you.

20:18.550 --> 20:19.903
She wanted me to
get a pIcture.

20:19.950 --> 20:21.349
Do you mind?
Um...

20:21.380 --> 20:23.848
She loved how
you stood by your husband.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.381
She wants to meet you.
(click)

20:26.420 --> 20:28.285
ALICIA:
Okay, let's

20:28.320 --> 20:30.720
talk strategy for a
minute, Brett. Amber?

20:30.760 --> 20:34.856
Yes. Good. Hold on.
I'm just sending this.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.562
Okay, the whole point is
to win in pretrial motions.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.398
If this goes to trial,
the jury can do anything.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.589
Even if you
are innocent,

20:41.640 --> 20:43.665
Judge Dunaway
isn't my biggest fan.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.769
So I'm gonna need you, Amber,

20:45.810 --> 20:47.573
to take some
of the motions.

20:47.610 --> 20:49.874
I'm ready. Excited really.
How do you want to attack this?

20:49.910 --> 20:51.446
BAILIFF:
_ All ris_e. Court
Is now In seSSIon.

20:51.480 --> 20:53.311
The Honorable Judge
Dunaway presiding.

20:53.350 --> 20:54.419
Thank you all.
You may sit.

20:54.450 --> 20:56.475
Mr. Brody and
Ms. Audrey...

20:56.520 --> 20:59.409
Well, actually, you...
you have someone new here.

20:59.450 --> 21:01.315
Yes, Your Honor.
Alicia Florrick,

21:01.360 --> 21:03.920
asking leave of the court
to join as co-counsel.

21:03.960 --> 21:06.588
Any objections,
Mr. Brody?
None, Your Honor.

21:06.630 --> 21:08.495
We do not hold
the recent election scandal

21:08.530 --> 21:09.895
against Alicia Florrick
at all.

21:09.930 --> 21:11.795
Of course, that's why
you brought it up,

21:11.830 --> 21:13.593
so it won't be held against her.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.631
Yes, Mrs. Florrick,

21:15.670 --> 21:16.796
you are more than welcome
to join the party.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.637
Take a seat.

21:18.670 --> 21:20.433
Now, pretrial motions--
what do you have?

21:20.480 --> 21:22.539
Argue for the inclusion
of the transcript now.

21:22.580 --> 21:24.309
Your Honor, the defense would
like the transcripts to be...

21:24.350 --> 21:25.806
We ask that the record
of the earlier trial be excluded

21:25.850 --> 21:27.738
from the records
as prejudICIal, Your Honor.

21:27.780 --> 21:30.613
The prosecution wants to exclude
this transcript for...

21:30.650 --> 21:33.312
Yes, we do. The jury should have
a clean hearing of the evidence.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.611
We're not arguing that.
They should not

21:34.660 --> 21:35.911
be tainted by the knowledge

21:35.960 --> 21:37.587
of an earlier trial.
Hold on.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.927
Let the defense speak.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.520
Thank you, Your Honor.

21:41.560 --> 21:43.790
I'm not... uh... (sighs)

21:43.830 --> 21:45.661
It's okay.

21:45.700 --> 21:47.463
Take a breath.
Thank you.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.593
(sighs)

21:49.640 --> 21:51.631
The prosecution is trying
to prevent the jury

21:51.670 --> 21:53.535
from hearing Brett's alibi.

21:53.580 --> 21:55.002
One of the witnesses has died,

21:55.040 --> 21:56.803
and our only record
of her testimony

21:56.840 --> 21:58.376
is in this previous trial.

21:58.410 --> 22:00.071
MATAN:
She's exactly right,
Your Honor.

22:00.110 --> 22:02.670
That's exactly why we want
to exclude this transcript.

22:02.720 --> 22:05.746
Because this witness,
a stripper named Lexie Bromwich,

22:05.790 --> 22:07.382
perjured herself
on the stand.

22:07.420 --> 22:08.682
Do you have evidence
to that effect?

22:08.720 --> 22:09.982
Why, I do.

22:10.020 --> 22:12.727
Thank you,
Mrs. Florrick.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.557
Uh, Daniel Cain.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.898
Uh, my occupation now is...

22:16.930 --> 22:19.069
(laughing):
not much.

22:19.100 --> 22:20.897
Beer drinker. (laughs)

22:20.940 --> 22:22.828
Um, but I used

22:22.870 --> 22:25.532
to work as a bouncer
at the Pink Sapphire.

22:25.570 --> 22:27.572
You worked
with the defendant Mr. Tatro?

22:27.610 --> 22:28.736
Yes, I did.

22:28.780 --> 22:29.735
Hey, Brett.

22:29.780 --> 22:31.042
MATAN:
Do you have any memory

22:31.080 --> 22:32.570
of Lexie Bromwich?

22:32.610 --> 22:34.009
Yeah, I do.

22:34.050 --> 22:35.870
I went to her funeral.
Poor kid.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.615
Do you have

22:37.650 --> 22:40.039
reason to disbelieve her
testImony from the ﬁrst trIal?

22:40.090 --> 22:42.615
Yeah. She was high.

22:42.660 --> 22:43.786
Objection.

22:43.830 --> 22:45.582
On what grounds?

22:45.630 --> 22:48.656
On the... give me a sec.
Grounds?

22:50.000 --> 22:52.389
Hearsay?

22:52.430 --> 22:56.560
Mr. Cain, do you have
firsthand knowledge

22:56.600 --> 22:59.637
that Lexie Bromwich was using
drugs on the day in question?

22:59.670 --> 23:00.978
Yes, I do.

23:01.010 --> 23:02.671
I saw her.

23:02.710 --> 23:04.575
Not only that.

23:04.610 --> 23:07.716
She testified for Brett
'cause he was her dealer.

23:14.460 --> 23:16.849
CARY:
So, you were a bodyguard
with Brett that night?

23:16.890 --> 23:20.553
No. No, just afterwards.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.421
One of these college kids
came running in...

23:23.470 --> 23:25.791
From the bachelor party?
Right. Yeah.

23:25.830 --> 23:28.799
He came in screaming, so I went
out to see what was going on.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.501
It was...
(distorted speech)

23:30.540 --> 23:31.700
DISTORTED VOICE:
Your mom won't...

23:31.740 --> 23:33.833
JACKIE:
...mind if we use this.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.701
ZACH:
I don't know.
She uses it for work.

23:36.740 --> 23:38.173
JACKIE:
Well, we have to hear
what you sound like.

23:38.210 --> 23:39.768
You ready?

23:39.810 --> 23:41.209
Now, I'm going
to stand right here.

23:41.250 --> 23:43.070
And remember, enunciate.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.644
(clears throat)

23:44.690 --> 23:47.557
Aung San Suu was born
in 1945 in Rangoon.

23:47.590 --> 23:50.753
Who's that?
That's who
my speech Is on.

23:50.790 --> 23:52.781
JACKIE:
What is she, Persian?

23:52.830 --> 23:55.526
(click)

23:55.560 --> 23:56.720
Hey, Alicia.
Everything all right?

23:56.760 --> 23:58.091
Yeah, sorry to bother you.

23:58.130 --> 23:59.722
I've run into a problem

23:59.770 --> 24:01.795
with some of the evidence

24:01.840 --> 24:04.968
that you dug up
on the Brett Tatro trial.

24:06.710 --> 24:07.836
Cary?

24:09.680 --> 24:11.545
Cary?

24:11.580 --> 24:13.514
I'm sorry.
What's the problem?

24:13.550 --> 24:15.108
Remember when

24:15.150 --> 24:18.608
we co-chaired the trial, we had
an argument over trial strategy?

24:18.650 --> 24:20.117
No.
ALICIA:
Yes.

24:20.150 --> 24:22.015
You thought
that the jury would want someone

24:22.060 --> 24:24.779
to blame for the beating, and
I wanted to put all the emphasis

24:24.830 --> 24:26.252
on the alibi.

24:26.290 --> 24:28.155
Right, right,
it was a good call. We won.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.792
Yes, but you were
collecting evidence

24:29.830 --> 24:30.967
on the other bouncer Daniel.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.558
You wanted to blame him.

24:32.600 --> 24:33.862
Do you have the files on that?

24:33.900 --> 24:35.538
Check the files I sent you.

24:35.570 --> 24:36.969
The interview
with Daniel should be in there.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.537
Yeah, someone recorded over it.

24:39.570 --> 24:42.835
Let me see what I have.

24:53.860 --> 24:57.751
ZACH:
At this moment, Aung San Suu Kyi

24:57.790 --> 24:59.519
is still under house arrest.

24:59.560 --> 25:01.289
(clapping on tape)

25:01.330 --> 25:02.922
That was very good.

25:02.960 --> 25:05.224
You have a very good
speaking voice.

25:05.270 --> 25:06.726
Thanks, Grandma.

25:06.770 --> 25:08.260
What was _her
name agaIn?

25:08.300 --> 25:10.609
Aung San Suu Kyi.
Oh.

25:10.640 --> 25:12.904
You know, your dad was
interested in people like that.

25:12.940 --> 25:14.635
Arabs and Russians

25:14.680 --> 25:16.033
and things like that.

25:16.080 --> 25:18.105
Like who?
Can you remember who?

25:18.150 --> 25:20.641
Some Russian guy. Um,

25:20.680 --> 25:22.079
Vackel?
Vaclav Havel?

25:22.120 --> 25:23.883
Yes.

25:23.920 --> 25:26.718
When he was your age,
he wanted to be like him.

25:26.750 --> 25:28.957
Why? Can you remember why?

25:28.990 --> 25:30.855
Oh, you know, justice.

25:30.890 --> 25:33.085
Things like that.

25:33.130 --> 25:35.690
You're a lot like your dad.

25:35.730 --> 25:37.698
He wants to make things better
for people.

25:37.730 --> 25:38.992
ZACH:
I know.

25:39.030 --> 25:41.635
Give me a hug.

25:42.840 --> 25:44.831
He loves you, you know.

25:44.870 --> 25:47.839
I know.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.871
You're a good boy.

25:49.910 --> 25:54.142
You're gonna change the world
just like your dad.

25:59.920 --> 26:02.184
(phone beeps on, line ringing)

26:02.220 --> 26:03.926
You've reached
Zach's v0Ice maII.

26:03.960 --> 26:06.224
I'm in class right now
or sleeping it off.

26:06.260 --> 26:07.898
(beep)

26:07.930 --> 26:11.627
Zach. Hi. It's Mom.

26:11.670 --> 26:14.332
We haven't talked in a while.

26:14.370 --> 26:15.928
(phone beeps off)

26:15.970 --> 26:17.733
(doorbell rings)

26:20.210 --> 26:22.906
Cary. You could have
sent someone.

26:22.940 --> 26:24.248
Yes, I could have.

26:24.280 --> 26:25.838
ALICIA:
You had all this stuff,

26:25.880 --> 26:27.916
and you never showed it to me?

26:27.950 --> 26:29.247
I did try to show you,

26:29.280 --> 26:31.714
but you wanted to take the case
in another direction.

26:31.750 --> 26:33.889
(laughs)
You didn't try
to show me.
I did.

26:33.920 --> 26:35.751
You always thought
I was more competitive

26:35.790 --> 26:37.781
than I really was.
You were competitive.

26:37.830 --> 26:39.229
Yeah, I was.

26:39.260 --> 26:40.852
(laughs)

26:43.770 --> 26:46.762
Wow. It's a lot of work.

26:46.800 --> 26:47.960
Oh, not really.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.865
So, how's it going?
I don't know.

26:49.900 --> 26:52.937
They're trying to
throw out the alibi.

26:52.970 --> 26:54.733
You know what?

26:54.780 --> 26:57.408
We're better lawyers now.

26:57.440 --> 26:59.249
Makes sense.
We were young.

26:59.280 --> 27:03.148
Yeah, but there's still
something I miss about it.
What?

27:03.180 --> 27:07.913
Looking at the law
as something good.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.851
Do you think
it's not good?

27:12.890 --> 27:16.018
No, I think
it's... neutral.

27:18.930 --> 27:21.160
Kalinda's gone.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.903
I know.

27:26.910 --> 27:29.333
Did you see her?

27:30.780 --> 27:32.805
No. Did you?

27:35.720 --> 27:37.915
She's not really one
for good-byes.

27:39.190 --> 27:41.715
I know.

27:41.760 --> 27:43.955
I'm sorry.

27:43.990 --> 27:46.220
Me, too.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.936
Well... hope you get to use
this stuff against Daniel.

27:53.970 --> 27:55.961
It's like a director's cut.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.706
Wouldn't mind finally
seeing it shown.

27:57.740 --> 27:59.958
Then let's show it.

28:03.010 --> 28:05.478
ALICIA:
Mr. Cain, in a news report
from 2009, you claimed

28:05.510 --> 28:08.308
you were never in the parking
lot where the ﬁght took place.

28:08.350 --> 28:10.443
Is that still true?
Uh-huh.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.311
"Uh-huh," uh, meaning "yes"?

28:12.350 --> 28:13.988
Yes.

28:14.020 --> 28:16.284
Correct. Affirmative. (laughs)
And yet,

28:16.320 --> 28:17.878
in this crime
scene photo,

28:17.930 --> 28:19.124
the front of your clothes seem

28:19.160 --> 28:20.991
to be covered in blood.

28:21.030 --> 28:22.998
So?
So, how did the blood get there?

28:23.030 --> 28:25.169
I cradled his head in my lap.

28:25.200 --> 28:28.829
After you hit him?
No. No, after Brett
hit him, or someone.

28:28.870 --> 28:31.009
So, you were in the parking lot?

28:31.040 --> 28:32.166
Afterward.

28:32.210 --> 28:34.132
After the fight.
Okay.

28:36.040 --> 28:39.043
Did you make a 911
call after the fight?

28:39.080 --> 28:41.514
Did I? No.
Did you have possession
of your cell phone?

28:41.550 --> 28:43.848
I did. Why?

28:43.890 --> 28:46.984
Oh, there's a record of
a 911 call from your cell phone,

28:47.020 --> 28:49.159
but the call was terminated
before you said anything.

28:51.030 --> 28:54.022
DUNAWAY:
Would you like to revise
your testimony, Mr. Cain?

28:54.060 --> 28:57.029
I... guess I called,

28:57.060 --> 28:58.891
but the guy
was bleeding,

28:58.930 --> 29:00.227
and I saw a lot

29:00.270 --> 29:01.828
of other people calling.

29:01.870 --> 29:02.962
I... I'm not lying.

29:05.140 --> 29:07.358
ALICIA:
So it's not
a strip club anymore.

29:07.410 --> 29:09.401
No, it's a charter school.
Okay.

29:09.440 --> 29:10.998
I need you
to get the names

29:11.050 --> 29:12.403
of the people
you worked with here,

29:12.450 --> 29:14.111
a-anyone you can remember.

29:14.150 --> 29:15.777
Why?
Well, we need
another way

29:15.820 --> 29:18.141
to establish your alibi in case
the judge rules against us.

29:18.190 --> 29:22.308
Just anyone you can think of,
and we'll try and locate them.

29:22.360 --> 29:24.021
What's wrong, Brett?
What's going on?

29:26.160 --> 29:28.025
Tell them.

29:28.060 --> 29:30.790
BRETT:
Just so you know,

29:30.830 --> 29:33.799
I'm innocent. I did not touch
that kid in that parking lot.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.137
But?

29:35.170 --> 29:38.139
But I was in the parking lot.

29:38.170 --> 29:40.331
But I-I didn't do this,
Alicia. I didn't.

29:40.370 --> 29:43.009
I was headed back to the car
to get something for Dakota.

29:43.040 --> 29:45.042
That's all.
To get what?

29:46.080 --> 29:48.139
To get what?

29:48.180 --> 29:49.818
You were her dealer?

29:49.850 --> 29:52.148
I was a different person.

29:52.190 --> 29:54.158
I've changed.

29:54.190 --> 29:56.954
So you got Dakota
to lie for you?

29:56.990 --> 29:59.129
You need to help me. Please.

29:59.160 --> 30:01.526
Please. I'm
Innocent.

30:08.170 --> 30:09.990
But we know it's perjury now.
Shh.

30:10.040 --> 30:12.008
We know that the alibi is false.

30:12.040 --> 30:14.201
We_ know that _Brett was
In that parkIng lot.

30:14.240 --> 30:16.470
He told us so. _ _
Yes, but we're not puttIng mm
on the stand,

30:16.510 --> 30:18.899
so we're not
subornIng perjury.
Yes.

30:18.950 --> 30:21.976
Okay, but we are allowing
Dakota's testimony

30:22.020 --> 30:25.512
to be entered into the record,
a testimony we know is false.

30:25.550 --> 30:30.487
We have
to tell the judge.
No. Listen, Amber.

30:30.520 --> 30:33.159
When we argued for
the transcript to be admitted,

30:33.190 --> 30:35.055
we didn't know it was false.

30:35.100 --> 30:36.852
Yes, but we do now.

30:36.900 --> 30:38.162
Right, but that
doesn't matter.

30:38.200 --> 30:42.034
When we argued for it yesterday,
we didn't know.

30:42.070 --> 30:44.903
That doesn't seem right.

30:44.940 --> 30:46.931
I know. But it's legal.

30:47.980 --> 30:50.949
I think I have a lot to learn.

30:50.980 --> 30:53.141
SHERIFF:
All rise.

30:53.180 --> 30:56.115
DUNAWAY:
Thank you.
Please be seated.

30:57.180 --> 31:00.115
I'm allowing the whole

31:00.150 --> 31:02.311
2009 transcript
into evidence...
Your Honor.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.453
Matan, you are welcome
to call your witness to testify

31:04.490 --> 31:06.651
if we do go to trial, and,
Mrs. Florrick, you're welcome

31:06.690 --> 31:09.420
to impeach him, just
like you both did here.
Your Honor,

31:09.460 --> 31:11.564
you mention
"if we do go to trial."

31:11.600 --> 31:14.296
Will you rule on our motion
to dismiss? Our client

31:14.340 --> 31:16.467
was already found
not guilty...
We have one more witness,

31:16.500 --> 31:18.604
Your Honor.

31:18.640 --> 31:20.232
Evan Houston.
Do you want to know

31:20.270 --> 31:22.101
what I do now
or what I did then?

31:22.140 --> 31:25.109
MATAN: Let's try then.
Well, I worked
in a gas station

31:25.150 --> 31:28.142
across the street from the strip
joint, the, um, Pink Sapphire.

31:28.180 --> 31:30.045
(whispering):
Was he in the previous trial?
No.

31:30.080 --> 31:31.445
Someone new.
And did you see
that man

31:31.490 --> 31:33.117
over there _
on the nIght In questIon?

31:33.150 --> 31:35.618
Yeah. He was in
the parking lot.

31:35.660 --> 31:38.220
He was beating
some kid up.
Thank you, sir.

31:38.260 --> 31:40.057
Mr. Houston,
this is your first time

31:40.090 --> 31:41.955
testifying against my client.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.353
Why didn't you come fonNard
six years ago?

31:43.400 --> 31:45.197
I did come forward
SIX years ago.

31:45.230 --> 31:47.460
I told the police the exact
same thing I'm telling you.

31:47.500 --> 31:50.162
What police?
A detective
named Hardy.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.998
ALICIA:
You did? Were you
too sick to testify?

31:53.040 --> 31:55.600
Were you out
of town, sir?
No, I was here.

31:55.640 --> 31:57.676
But the prosecution
didn't want you to testify?

31:57.710 --> 32:00.178
Objection. Argumentative.
Let it go, Matan.
You may answer.

32:00.210 --> 32:03.270
They said they didn't need me.
How did you...

32:03.320 --> 32:04.685
I.D.

32:04.720 --> 32:07.041
my client,
Mr. Houston?

32:07.090 --> 32:08.159
In a lineup.

32:10.190 --> 32:12.454
I wasn't aware my client was in

32:12.490 --> 32:13.388
a lineup.

32:13.430 --> 32:15.091
A photo lineup.

32:17.430 --> 32:20.126
(indistinct chatter)

32:20.170 --> 32:22.559
You looked good in
there, I thought.

32:22.600 --> 32:25.160
No. We're losing.

32:25.210 --> 32:27.235
The judge is gonna allow this
to go to trial.

32:27.270 --> 32:29.170
Iwwmm
with this new witness.

32:29.210 --> 32:32.202
He seemed
conVInced.

32:33.210 --> 32:35.314
You know, when I was an A.S.A.,

32:35.350 --> 32:37.568
I was told to double-check

32:37.620 --> 32:40.282
cases coming through
a certain detective's hands.

32:40.320 --> 32:43.255
Why is that?

32:43.290 --> 32:45.258
'Cause he was
old-school.

32:45.290 --> 32:47.258
If he didn't get
photo array results he liked,

32:47.290 --> 32:50.396
he'd reshuffle the mug shots and
ask the eyewitness to try again.

32:50.430 --> 32:54.434
Or he'd place a finger
on the suspect's photo.

32:54.470 --> 32:56.995
How do you know that?

33:01.080 --> 33:03.503
There was _
an I.A.D. InvestIgatIon.

33:03.540 --> 33:07.340
Inconclusive. They dropped
it about a year ago.

33:09.680 --> 33:12.012
Who was the detective?

33:12.050 --> 33:14.189
Hardy.

33:14.220 --> 33:16.188
(chuckles)

33:16.220 --> 33:20.759
That's why Matan didn't put Evan
on the stand in 2009.

33:20.790 --> 33:23.520
He was worried
about the photo array.

33:23.560 --> 33:27.223
That would
be my guess.

33:27.270 --> 33:28.737
Thank you.

33:30.300 --> 33:32.302
I didn't say anything.

33:35.340 --> 33:37.103
ALICIA:
Thank you for coming in,
Detective Hardy.

33:37.140 --> 33:39.745
No problem. It's my job.
In what way
did the eyewitness,

33:39.780 --> 33:42.374
Evan Houston, I.D. my client?

33:42.420 --> 33:45.389
Was it by lineup or photo array?

33:45.420 --> 33:47.411
HARDY: Photo array.
And did he identify
him right away?

33:47.450 --> 33:50.248
HARDY: Yes.
You didn't need to take him
through the photos a second time

33:50.290 --> 33:53.157
because he was prone
to misidentify?
Objection. Asked and answered.

33:53.190 --> 33:57.126
And yet I'd like to hear
the answer a second time.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.388
Detective?
No,

33:58.430 --> 34:00.125
I did not take him
through a second time.

34:00.170 --> 34:02.058
Isn't there a slang for this
in the department,

34:02.100 --> 34:04.330
the act of running a photo array
past the witness a second time?

34:04.370 --> 34:07.168
Yeah, might be.
H don't know it.

34:07.210 --> 34:10.805
P.O.E.
Process of elimination.
FascmatIng.

34:10.840 --> 34:15.311
Detective, wasn't there an
Internal Affairs investigation

34:15.350 --> 34:17.443
into your use of
these photo arrays...
Objection!

34:17.480 --> 34:19.482
Uh, I haven't even gotten
the question out yet,

34:19.520 --> 34:21.249
Your Honor.
This is disgusting.

34:21.290 --> 34:23.315
I.A.D. investigations
are confidential.
Yes,

34:23.360 --> 34:25.351
but I'm asking
the detective about

34:25.390 --> 34:27.221
a specific practice
that has a crucial bearing

34:27.260 --> 34:29.455
on this case,
his use of photo arrays.

34:29.500 --> 34:32.298
Then ask him the question.
Don't...
I am asking him the question.

34:32.330 --> 34:36.369
Did I.A.D. ever investigate you
for faulty photo arrays,

34:36.400 --> 34:38.265
and is that the
only reason why

34:38.310 --> 34:40.528
Evan Houston was not included
in the first trial?

34:40.570 --> 34:41.707
Excuse me, Your Honor,
I want a ruling.
Was because

34:41.740 --> 34:43.537
Evan Houston
only selected

34:43.580 --> 34:46.469
my client's photo
after being shown his photo

34:46.510 --> 34:49.217
in two separate photo arrays.
Objection! Object-Objection!

34:49.250 --> 34:52.811
All right. Thank you.
Why don't we all calm down now?

34:52.850 --> 34:54.715
Mrs. Florrick, you got
out your question,

34:54.760 --> 34:56.250
which is what
you wanted.

34:56.290 --> 34:57.518
Matan, you registered
your disgust,

34:57.560 --> 34:58.879
which is what
you wanted.

34:58.930 --> 35:01.148
Why don't you all come
up here now?

35:05.330 --> 35:08.367
Where did you hear
of this I.A.D. report,

35:08.400 --> 35:10.436
ma'am?
Your Honor, if there's
no public knowledge

35:10.470 --> 35:13.268
of an I.A.D investigation, that
means the officer was cleared.

35:13.310 --> 35:15.175
Or there was lack of evidence.
Obviously
But that's the whole point.

35:15.210 --> 35:16.575
there was some sort of...
We don't know.
Thank you.

35:16.610 --> 35:19.170
Thank you, Matan.
You might be right,

35:19.210 --> 35:22.646
but I don't know how much
I trust your detective.
Your Honor, that is unfair.

35:22.680 --> 35:24.682
It's based _
on rumor-mongerIng.
Yes,

35:24.720 --> 35:27.314
and that is why I'm asking Mrs.
Florrick how she knows this.

35:27.350 --> 35:29.614
The way she's always known it,
through her husband

35:29.660 --> 35:32.629
or her law partner, Cary Agos.
How do you know about
the I.A.D. report,

35:32.660 --> 35:35.151
Mrs. Florrick?
And if one of them did slip this
to her, they're in trouble,

35:35.200 --> 35:36.394
because this work product

35:36.430 --> 35:38.318
is confidential.
They could be disbarred

35:38.370 --> 35:41.362
or be imprisoned.
Matan, stop.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.231
Mrs. Florrick,
it's a simple question.

35:43.270 --> 35:46.467
How do you know about
the I.A.D. report?

35:46.510 --> 35:48.728
I can't say, Your Honor.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.805
Why can't
you say?

35:50.840 --> 35:52.671
Because I am bound.

35:52.710 --> 35:54.940
Well, that
is unfortunate

35:54.980 --> 35:56.845
because you're gonna have to
unbound yourself pretty quick,

35:56.880 --> 35:58.939
or you'll be found in contempt.
Sheriff.

35:58.990 --> 36:02.517
I would like to consult
WIth counsel,

36:02.560 --> 36:04.255
Your Honor.

36:04.290 --> 36:05.951
You don't want to test me,
Mrs. Florrick.

36:05.990 --> 36:08.220
I'm not testing you, Your Honor.

36:08.260 --> 36:11.866
You take the night
to consult with counsel.

36:11.900 --> 36:13.891
And come in tomorrow
prepared to answer.

36:13.930 --> 36:15.192
(gavelbangs)

36:21.240 --> 36:24.209
(door opens)

36:26.250 --> 36:28.616
Mr. Kingsley-Weaver.
I'm so sorry.

36:28.650 --> 36:30.515
Did we have a meeting today?

36:30.550 --> 36:32.541
I thought we did, unless we got

36:32.590 --> 36:35.957
our wires crossed.
No. Um, I've been... distracted.

36:35.990 --> 36:37.218
Your daughter
let me in.

36:37.260 --> 36:38.955
She's very sweet.
Thank you.

36:38.990 --> 36:40.787
She showed me your pictures
in there.

36:40.830 --> 36:42.855
All the
murder photos.

36:42.900 --> 36:46.222
It's quite grisly.
Can you tell me about it?

36:46.270 --> 36:47.965
It might help me
with the structure.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.333
I... Mm.

37:18.870 --> 37:21.566
ALICIA:
But it's wrong, isn't it?

37:21.600 --> 37:24.706
Cary basically told
the witness to lie.

37:24.740 --> 37:26.332
She was gonna contradict
Brett's alibi.

37:26.370 --> 37:27.860
Did you tell her to lie?

37:27.910 --> 37:30.299
No, but...
Do you believe
in the client?

37:30.340 --> 37:31.978
What do you mean?

37:32.010 --> 37:35.047
Well, do you think that
your client's telling the truth?

37:35.080 --> 37:36.718
I don't know
if he's telling the full truth.

37:36.750 --> 37:38.980
Nobody ever tells
the full truth.

37:39.020 --> 37:40.988
Even
God, you're such a cynic.

37:41.020 --> 37:42.009
No,

37:42.060 --> 37:44.528
just... experienced.

37:44.560 --> 37:46.357
Look,
Alicia,

37:46.390 --> 37:50.053
do you think that your client
beat this guy up?
No.

37:50.100 --> 37:53.968
Then it's all right for you
to do everything within the law

37:54.000 --> 37:55.558
to defend him.

37:55.600 --> 37:57.568
Not even all right.
It's your duty.

37:57.600 --> 37:58.908
But is it all right to lie?

37:58.940 --> 38:01.408
(chuckles)
Not under oath.

38:01.440 --> 38:04.568
Okay.

38:04.610 --> 38:06.771
Here's to experience.

38:06.810 --> 38:07.947
Experience.

38:13.620 --> 38:14.985
(knocking)

38:15.020 --> 38:16.658
Hey.

38:16.690 --> 38:18.658
Hey. Sorry about the mess
I left in the dining room.

38:18.690 --> 38:20.089
That's okay.

38:20.130 --> 38:21.995
You on a case?
I am.

38:22.030 --> 38:24.999
That's good. You're happier
when you're on a case.

38:25.030 --> 38:28.659
Really?
Yeah, I worry about you
when you just sit at home.

38:28.700 --> 38:31.339
(chuckles softly)

38:32.710 --> 38:36.009
I'm thinking
about starting my own firm.

38:36.040 --> 38:38.008
What do you think about that?

38:38.040 --> 38:40.008
But you already
started one, didn't you?

38:40.050 --> 38:42.109
Yeah,
but this would be different.

38:42.150 --> 38:44.516
It would be to help people
I wanted to help.

38:44.550 --> 38:46.882
Can you make money doing that?

38:46.920 --> 38:49.957
(chuckles)
I don't know.

38:49.990 --> 38:52.083
I guess we'll have to see.

38:52.130 --> 38:53.950
I'd have to work out
of the apartment.

38:53.990 --> 38:55.457
In the dining room?

38:55.500 --> 38:56.694
No.

38:56.730 --> 38:59.164
I don't know.

39:03.040 --> 39:06.464
*

39:18.080 --> 39:20.640
Turn it on its side.

39:28.960 --> 39:31.929
Nice. Okay.
You ready?

39:31.970 --> 39:34.666
One, two, three.
Three.

39:41.110 --> 39:43.806
Okay.

39:51.220 --> 39:52.949
Not bad, Mom.

39:52.990 --> 39:54.787
Yep. Back
to basics.

39:54.820 --> 39:56.788
Hey, I could be
your secretary.

39:56.820 --> 40:00.119
(chuckles)
No, I could answer your phone
calls, get you coffee.

40:00.160 --> 40:01.149
Graduate from school.

40:01.190 --> 40:03.021
No, I have to have
an internship.

40:03.060 --> 40:05.028
This can be it.
Yeah.

40:05.070 --> 40:08.028
(phone rings)
We'll see.

40:08.070 --> 40:10.868
Hello.

40:10.900 --> 40:13.869
Hello. Look, if
this is sales,

40:13.910 --> 40:16.037
you'd better hang up now
or I will rip you a new one.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.969
I'm a lawyer, and
that'll be my first case.
Go, Mom.

40:19.010 --> 40:22.013
ZACH:
Hello, Mom. It's me.
Zach.

40:22.050 --> 40:24.689
Hi. How are you?
Good.

40:24.720 --> 40:27.109
I got your call.
Is everything okay?

40:27.150 --> 40:30.153
Yes. Great, in fact.
Really great.

40:30.190 --> 40:32.624
Good. I was thinking
of coming home tomorrow night.

40:32.660 --> 40:35.049
Oh.

40:39.830 --> 40:41.195
(indistinct chatter)

40:41.230 --> 40:43.039
Do you know
what you're gonna do?

40:43.070 --> 40:44.662
Maybe.

40:44.710 --> 40:48.237
If he jails me, I need
you to call Cary Agos.

40:48.270 --> 40:50.579
Sure. Do you think
it'll come to that?

40:50.610 --> 40:52.498
No idea.
SHERIFF:
All rise.

40:52.550 --> 40:55.212
Mrs. Florrick. Mr. Brody.

40:55.250 --> 40:57.138
Up here.

40:57.180 --> 41:00.013
(clears throat)
Well, okay,
Mrs. Florrick,

41:00.050 --> 41:01.813
have you consulted with counsel?

41:01.860 --> 41:03.657
I have, Your Honor.
Are you ready
to tell us

41:03.690 --> 41:06.079
who informed you about
this I.A.D. investigation?

41:06.130 --> 41:08.121
Well, first of all, Your...

41:08.160 --> 41:10.219
No "first of all."
Tell me now or be held

41:10.260 --> 41:11.989
in contempt.
Someone tried to help me,
Your Honor.

41:12.030 --> 41:13.588
Someone who knew
that Detective Hardy was...

41:13.630 --> 41:15.097
Your Honor,
this is outrageous.
Yes,

41:15.140 --> 41:16.266
it is. Mrs. Florrick,

41:16.300 --> 41:18.268
answer the question.
I will tell you

41:18.300 --> 41:21.804
who informed me
of the I.A.D. investigation,

41:21.840 --> 41:24.775
but I want to explain to you
why they did it.

41:24.810 --> 41:27.904
Because justice matters
to them.

41:27.950 --> 41:30.919
They saw an injustice
at the heart of this case,

41:30.950 --> 41:33.612
and I think you've seen it, too,

41:33.650 --> 41:35.515
Your Honor.
Mrs. Florrick,

41:35.560 --> 41:37.255
who told you?

41:37.290 --> 41:40.088
Kalinda Sharma.

41:40.130 --> 41:41.791
Oh, come on.

41:41.830 --> 41:44.298
This is 3.5., Your Honor.
Mrs. Florrick is mentioning

41:44.330 --> 41:46.696
the only person who is
no longer in our jurisdiction.

41:46.730 --> 41:48.129
I answered your question,
Your Honor.

41:48.170 --> 41:50.934
I'm not sure
what more the SA...
Kalinda Sharma

41:50.970 --> 41:53.131
fled our jurisdiction.
We cannot arrest her.

41:53.170 --> 41:54.637
She did not do this.
It's either Cary Agos

41:54.680 --> 41:56.170
or her
husband.

41:56.210 --> 41:59.998
I answered your question,
Your Honor.

42:00.050 --> 42:03.076
Yes, you did.

42:03.120 --> 42:04.587
Thank you, Mrs. Florrick.

42:06.120 --> 42:07.747
On the record.

42:07.790 --> 42:10.918
As to your motion to dismiss,
I will sustain that.

42:10.960 --> 42:12.552
Your Honor...
No, Matan.

42:12.590 --> 42:15.559
You had your shot in 2009.
Let it go.

42:15.600 --> 42:17.124
Mr. Tatro,

42:17.160 --> 42:20.561
your case has been
dismissed with prejudice.

42:20.600 --> 42:22.568
(gavelbangs)

42:22.600 --> 42:24.329
Thank you. Thank you.

42:24.370 --> 42:28.033
I'm so glad this worked out,
Brett.

42:28.070 --> 42:30.231
I want to learn from you.

42:30.280 --> 42:33.841
(chuckles)
No, you don't.

42:35.220 --> 42:38.212
*

42:38.250 --> 42:40.218
* Watching
through the moonlight *

42:40.250 --> 42:43.811
* Feel the softness of the air

42:43.860 --> 42:47.887
* Sleeping in the shadows
of the heavens... *

42:47.930 --> 42:50.728
So...

42:50.760 --> 42:54.196
how's your crisis
of confidence going?

42:54.230 --> 42:55.629
Better.

42:55.670 --> 42:58.036
I'm so glad.

42:59.940 --> 43:02.329
I'm thinking
of starting my own firm

43:02.380 --> 43:05.349
and only taking cases
I believe in,

43:05.380 --> 43:08.008
and I want to know
if you'll join me.

43:08.050 --> 43:09.915
* Your magic

43:09.950 --> 43:11.838
* Can't change your habits,
so let's be light. *
