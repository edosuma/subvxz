00:58.800 --> 01:01.189
Look, sir, the headmaster's on the roof.

01:01.280 --> 01:03.236
(Shouting angrily)

01:04.400 --> 01:06.356
(Ranting)

01:09.680 --> 01:11.830
Get the hell up there and gag him.

01:17.680 --> 01:21.468
All right, everyone back inside now.
Come on, move it.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.076
(Still shouting)

01:32.720 --> 01:34.597
Bloody hell.

01:35.880 --> 01:38.678
That's the end of my bloody life here!

01:38.760 --> 01:41.832
- Let's see them give it to you!
- Come on.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.876
(Sobbing)

01:47.200 --> 01:49.156
- Nobody warned me!
- It's all right.

01:49.240 --> 01:51.515
I've had enough of it... (Sobbing)

02:01.440 --> 02:04.159
We'll soon have this lot sorted, Mr Rimmer.

02:05.080 --> 02:07.992
And I, for one, will be more than happy
working for you.

02:09.479 --> 02:11.232
I could kill the mad old sod.

02:11.320 --> 02:14.312
It's like taking over the
Charge of the Light Brigade mid-gallop.

02:14.400 --> 02:17.073
You'll be glad of the extra remuneration.

02:17.160 --> 02:21.438
Oh, yeah. I've got an ex-wife
and two college fees to fund.

02:22.280 --> 02:25.431
But I'd rather find a deputy
to do the work for me.

02:25.520 --> 02:29.354
I did find this promising candidate
in the Apps file, though.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.954
D'you think you can arrange a meeting
for me after hours?

02:32.040 --> 02:35.396
- In your office?
- No. In my...other office.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.988
Most of the time,
they just need a firm hand, you know.

02:41.480 --> 02:44.438
Andrew Treneman? jack Rimmer.

02:44.520 --> 02:46.670
- What can I get you?
- Er...

02:46.760 --> 02:48.113
Deputy headship?

02:48.200 --> 02:50.236
(Chuckles ) Take a seat.

02:52.200 --> 02:55.670
Yeah, well, anyone can teach
the privileged, eh?

02:55.760 --> 02:57.751
Well, I...

02:57.840 --> 03:02.675
It's just that the last time I applied, I was
told my methods wouldn't go down too well.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.354
Incompatible with
the comprehensive ethos.

03:05.440 --> 03:09.274
Well, the man who told you that is now
sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

03:09.360 --> 03:12.955
What we've got now is a struggle
to keep the padlocks off the gates.

03:13.040 --> 03:14.758
You say you're up for a challenge.

03:14.840 --> 03:18.674
All most our kids leave school with
is an ASBO or a bun in the oven.

03:18.760 --> 03:21.593
How many pupils are currently
on behaviour agreements?

03:21.680 --> 03:22.874
Mm?

03:22.960 --> 03:24.837
The seriously disruptive.

03:24.920 --> 03:27.798
You presumably try to progress them
through the stages.

03:27.880 --> 03:30.758
Well, this is it, Andrew.
This is the task ahead, right?

03:30.840 --> 03:34.435
Why I think I've found the right man
to help me turn the place around.

03:34.520 --> 03:35.873
Cheers, darling.

03:36.760 --> 03:41.151
You'd be prepared to give me a free hand,
then? And your full support?

03:41.240 --> 03:44.232
Absolutely. Whatever it is you need,
you tell me.

03:44.320 --> 03:45.673
OK.

03:47.240 --> 03:49.196
Deal. I accept.

03:49.280 --> 03:52.158
Delighted, Andrew.
And you can start in a month?

03:52.240 --> 03:55.516
- Don't see why not.
- In that case, welcome to Waterloo Road.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.556
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

03:59.560 --> 04:01.596
Can you tell him we want to change
table three

04:01.680 --> 04:03.636
and say I'll call him back at lunch time?

04:04.480 --> 04:06.232
Yes. Clarkson.

04:06.320 --> 04:08.880
Right. Fine. Thank you.

04:09.760 --> 04:13.196
Meetings and Events
aren't available before 9:30.

04:13.280 --> 04:17.273
Anyway, you agree, don't you?
If anyone needs to be sat right at the far end...

04:17.360 --> 04:19.315
Aren't you having any breakfast?

04:19.399 --> 04:22.870
I'm looking for support here, Tom,
or your Uncle Reg could spoil the wedding.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.712
He's not worth crying over.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.872
What, you don't think your Uncle Reg's
personal hygiene's a problem?

04:31.760 --> 04:34.228
Lorna, I...I'm the problem, aren't I?

04:34.320 --> 04:38.393
At last! I've had to worry about every
little detail to get this organised on time,

04:38.480 --> 04:40.232
which I haven't complained about.

04:40.320 --> 04:43.039
- Maybe it would be better to cancel it.
- Cancel it?

04:43.120 --> 04:47.193
Well, seriously,
if it's causing you so much stress.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.236
I'm hardly not coping with it, am I?

04:49.320 --> 04:53.677
Luckily for you, Tom Clarkson,
I'm a very organised person.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.274
''Cancel the wedding''!
Your brother's already in the air.

05:04.480 --> 05:06.436
(Chatting)

05:12.000 --> 05:13.752
Fares.

05:15.560 --> 05:17.198
Fares!

05:17.280 --> 05:19.271
- Aah! Hey!
- Hand it over.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.550
Erm, I think you'll find that belongs to him.

05:27.640 --> 05:29.358
I just need their fares.

05:29.440 --> 05:31.715
- What's your problem, mate?
- I saw you take it.

05:31.800 --> 05:34.394
- Tell him to pay up.
- Keep that mouth of yours shut.

05:34.480 --> 05:36.948
- Hand it over and pay up.
- This is mine.

05:37.040 --> 05:39.270
He'll tell you, innit, Stephen?

05:39.360 --> 05:41.032
- (Groans )
- Innit it, Stephen?

05:41.120 --> 05:43.111
It's Donte's. One, please.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.077
Did you hear me? He's got this boy's ticket.

05:45.160 --> 05:47.310
The police might want to be involved in this.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.311
- What?
- Theft and assault.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.197
There are plenty of witnesses.

05:51.280 --> 05:54.352
You saw this boy kick this other boy,
didn't you?

05:54.440 --> 05:57.591
- Well, what about you?
- See? You can go and shove it.

05:57.680 --> 05:59.875
I think not. Could you dial 999, please?

05:59.960 --> 06:01.951
Hey, get off!

06:05.480 --> 06:08.472
- Mika, will you have some toast?
- No, I said.

06:08.560 --> 06:10.949
- Well, what about a banana?
- Mum.

06:11.040 --> 06:13.474
Chopped up with some yoghurt.
Mm, lovely.

06:13.560 --> 06:15.949
You're always nagging.
No wonder Dad left.

06:16.840 --> 06:19.274
Yeah. Had nothing to do with
his 23-year-old bimbo.

06:19.360 --> 06:23.638
- Well, why can't he come back?
- Mika, I'm sorry, but he doesn't want to.

06:23.720 --> 06:26.473
What? Are you saying
you'd let him if he did?

06:26.560 --> 06:28.596
- Mika...
- (Sighs ) Oh...

06:31.160 --> 06:34.038
Mum, can I have half of next week's
pocket money now?

06:34.120 --> 06:36.873
- Forget it, Chlo.
- But I wanna buy someone a present.

06:36.960 --> 06:40.077
I know who you wanna spend your money
on and I wish you'd grow out of him.

06:40.160 --> 06:42.833
Well, you don't have to fancy
who I fancy, do you?

06:42.920 --> 06:45.275
I know, darling,
but he's just not good enough for you.

06:45.360 --> 06:48.716
Come on, we've got to get going.
Fetch your things.

07:04.160 --> 07:05.912
(Shrieking)

07:06.000 --> 07:08.070
(Siren )

07:08.160 --> 07:10.037
You're a dead man, mister!

07:13.440 --> 07:17.831
I presume you're aware of what happens
if you lie to the police?

07:18.760 --> 07:21.672
- Problem?
- Er, yes. Hello, Officer.

07:21.760 --> 07:24.194
Theft and assault. On this chap here.

07:24.280 --> 07:26.714
- I've made a citizen's arrest.
- Oh, yeah?

07:26.800 --> 07:28.836
He's a liar, yeah? He assaulted me!

07:28.920 --> 07:31.150
That's not true, is it, Stephen?

07:34.720 --> 07:37.632
- Tell the truth.
- Let the lad speak for himself.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.597
Well...Donte kicked me.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.834
And then he stole my buss pass an' all.

07:46.080 --> 07:49.550
Right. And you are...?

07:49.640 --> 07:51.437
Donte Charles.

07:56.560 --> 07:59.597
This is the last time I'll have
to introduce myself as Miss Dickey.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.353
- Hey?
- To our new deputy headmaster.

08:02.440 --> 08:06.228
Well, maybe I'll just say I'm Lorna Clarkson.
After all, I soon will be.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.675
- Don't do that.
- You think it's bad luck?

08:08.760 --> 08:10.716
You're even more of a worrier than me.

08:10.800 --> 08:13.598
- Look, Lorna...
- How's his fancy footwork coming along?

08:13.680 --> 08:16.831
No match for mine yet.
I might have to marry you instead, Izzie.

08:16.920 --> 08:20.799
Don't worry, I'll slap him into shape.
You, lunch-time detention.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.474
Should we invite the deputy headmaster
to the reception?

08:23.560 --> 08:26.028
- Lorna...
- We're going to be seeing him every day.

08:26.120 --> 08:30.398
just calm down, yeah? But if he's
good-looking and single...yes, please.

08:30.480 --> 08:33.232
(Girls) Morning, Mr Clarkson.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.236
I'll catch you later.

08:38.440 --> 08:40.395
Listen, Lorna, we can't do this.

08:40.480 --> 08:42.232
I can't marry you.

08:42.320 --> 08:44.072
- What?
- I mean it.

08:44.159 --> 08:45.912
- (Bell)
- I can't. It's not right.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.798
- What?
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.634
How can a whole busload of kids
simply disappear?

08:56.720 --> 08:58.711
It's like something out of bloody Doctor Who.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.711
Mystery over.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.552
- What's happened?
- Donte Charles has been arrested.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.272
Settle down.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.316
(Chatting continues )

09:26.680 --> 09:29.638
- I said settle down!
- (All go quiet)

09:31.960 --> 09:34.633
jade, Kayleigh, give out the textbooks.

09:35.960 --> 09:39.475
(Tom ) So, who do we think
we're supposed to blame?

09:39.560 --> 09:42.916
Or do we think
it wasn't really anybody's fault?

09:44.160 --> 09:46.116
Because what went wrong...

09:47.520 --> 09:49.590
was all down to fate.

09:51.040 --> 09:53.395
Like when Gareth Southgate
missed that penalty.

09:55.080 --> 09:57.878
Mr Clarkson,
could I have a quick word, please?

09:58.760 --> 10:01.752
- Miss Dickey wants a quickie!
- (Laughter)

10:01.840 --> 10:03.592
All right.

10:04.680 --> 10:06.477
Discuss.

10:10.720 --> 10:13.678
- You've got to tell me you're joking, Tom.
- We can't do this now.

10:13.760 --> 10:17.150
Four years we've been planning this.
You can't just suddenly cancel it.

10:17.240 --> 10:19.196
I just want to do what's best for us.

10:19.280 --> 10:23.990
Lorna, honestly, I just don't think
things are gonna work out for us any more.

10:24.080 --> 10:26.036
- It's because of me, isn't it?
- No!

10:26.120 --> 10:29.874
- You think I've been turning into a wife.
- I'm not blaming you for anything.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.599
I've been so uptight
trying to make everything so perfect.

10:32.680 --> 10:34.033
It's not just the wedding.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.953
Look, I promise you,
I'm just gonna lighten up and enjoy it.

10:38.040 --> 10:39.951
I mean, who cares
where your Uncle Reg sits?

10:40.040 --> 10:43.032
All I care about is
you and me being happy together.

10:43.120 --> 10:46.556
This is it. I can't make you happy any more

10:46.640 --> 10:50.474
Of course you can. You'll make me
the happiest woman in the world.

10:51.680 --> 10:54.035
Lorna, it's...it's over.

10:55.640 --> 10:58.518
Not just the relationship, the wedding...

10:59.440 --> 11:01.237
It's me.

11:02.920 --> 11:04.831
I'm not in love with you.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.314
- Sit down.
- (Door shuts )

11:13.400 --> 11:15.277
Yes, I know who Donte Charles is.

11:15.360 --> 11:18.591
I just want you to know I'm gonna
flay him alive when I get hold of him.

11:18.680 --> 11:22.116
- Hello. Is Mr Rimmer...?
- On the phone.

11:22.200 --> 11:24.077
And you are...?

11:27.160 --> 11:31.153
Yes, we do care about
the behaviour of our pupils.

11:31.240 --> 11:33.196
I think I'd better...

11:35.400 --> 11:38.676
Look, we're sorry about your bus schedule
being interrupted!

11:38.760 --> 11:40.716
You'll just have to knock louder.

11:40.800 --> 11:45.237
Look, we are not in a position
to offer compensation.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.550
I don't think Mr Rimmer's
going to take too kindly

11:47.640 --> 11:50.438
to you listening in
on his private conversations.

11:51.880 --> 11:53.632
(Angrily) Yes? Who is it?

11:55.160 --> 11:57.071
Why don't you get
the bloody parents to pay?

11:57.160 --> 11:58.912
They're the ones who brought them up.

11:59.720 --> 12:03.554
You can't be serious. From what I understand,
this was a minor incident

12:03.640 --> 12:06.916
that's been blown out of all proportion
by some daft, have-a-go hero.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.558
Erm, Headmaster...

12:10.440 --> 12:12.192
Do what you want, then.

12:13.280 --> 12:16.955
joker. Trying to tell me they're
not gonna bus our children to school.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.598
I'm sorry about being late.

12:18.680 --> 12:22.514
You know, I brought you here
to set an example and on your first day...

12:22.600 --> 12:25.433
The, er...have-a-go hero.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.874
- You're winding me up, aren't you?
- I witnessed a crime.

12:29.960 --> 12:32.394
I felt duty-bound to intervene.

12:32.480 --> 12:35.438
Your duty is to this school
and to this headmaster.

12:35.520 --> 12:37.875
Haven't we also got a duty to the pupils?

12:37.960 --> 12:41.316
I mean, to face them with
the consequences of their actions.

12:41.400 --> 12:46.269
Listen, Andrew, this school is
bang-slap in the middle of hoodlum-land.

12:46.360 --> 12:49.557
It may not suit the educational
psychologists to say it,

12:49.640 --> 12:51.596
but it's a hard fact.

12:51.680 --> 12:54.638
- Nicking a bus ticket, well, it's...
- Acceptable?

12:54.720 --> 12:57.359
It's not worth giving me
a bloody headache over.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.192
(Mobile )

13:00.160 --> 13:01.912
jack Rimmer.

13:03.160 --> 13:05.879
Oh, great, the Rochdale Gazette.

13:07.760 --> 13:09.910
Yes, I am aware of the incident.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.755
Yeah, of course we have
an anti-bullying strategy!

13:13.840 --> 13:18.231
Police have got an anti-crime strategy -
doesn't stop it happening.

13:18.320 --> 13:20.629
I am not being complacent!

13:21.520 --> 13:23.476
(Shouting)

13:42.120 --> 13:44.156
Er, Mr Budgen? Andrew Treneman.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.196
Sorry you had to take my class.

13:47.240 --> 13:49.196
That was good timing.

14:41.560 --> 14:44.836
Hi. Erm, I just thought
I'd introduce myself.

14:44.920 --> 14:47.514
Kim Campbell. Head of Pastoral Care.

14:47.600 --> 14:50.910
- Welcome to Waterloo Road Comp.
- Glad to be here.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.709
- So, a bit different from your old school?.
- just a bit.

14:55.800 --> 14:59.634
I think you'll find that the children here
don't really like being regimented.

14:59.720 --> 15:03.759
They must be different from
all the other children I've taught, then.

15:03.840 --> 15:05.796
Yeah, it might be a little bit of a shock.

15:05.880 --> 15:10.874
But don't let me put you off.
You go right ahead and...

15:13.000 --> 15:14.479
OK.

15:25.160 --> 15:29.312
I went, ''I'm coming after you, mate.''
He was wetting himself.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.356
What's your old man gonna say?

15:32.240 --> 15:35.198
Reckon he'll be well wound up, man.
I do mean proper.

15:36.680 --> 15:38.636
(Laughs, yells)

15:38.720 --> 15:41.109
Hey, let's see what it feels like.

15:47.240 --> 15:49.037
You.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.352
Not too...

16:00.200 --> 16:02.156
Together till death.

16:08.280 --> 16:11.238
Are you trying to take advantage of me
cos I'm drunk?

16:23.560 --> 16:26.120
Are you telling me there's somebody else?

16:29.040 --> 16:32.191
Tell me. Is there somebody else?

16:32.280 --> 16:34.475
- No, I...
- You liar!

16:34.560 --> 16:37.916
- Tell me. Is there somebody else?
- No.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.278
About lunch time. We'll have to do it in
the art room, the gym's got their chairs out.

16:45.560 --> 16:47.312
Lorna?

16:53.840 --> 16:55.512
(Sighs )

16:55.600 --> 16:58.160
He can't mean it, Lorna.
It doesn't make any sense.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.988
- Do you think he's got someone else?
- No.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.195
I think he's totally committed to you.

17:04.280 --> 17:07.795
- Maybe it's just last-minute nerves.
- There's got to be something else.

17:07.880 --> 17:10.678
There's got to be something
that he's not telling you.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.829
- Oh, my god, Izzie.
- What?

17:13.920 --> 17:16.957
- It couldn't be cancer, could it?
- What?

17:17.040 --> 17:20.156
His father had prostate cancer last year.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.800
- Tom thought it might be hereditary.
- Come on.

17:22.880 --> 17:25.348
Surely if he'd got cancer,
he would have told you that.

17:26.240 --> 17:29.357
Look, go home and I'll get somebody
to cover your class.

17:29.440 --> 17:32.238
- Will you talk to him, Izzie?
- Course I will.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.956
I'll kill myself if he leaves me.

17:36.040 --> 17:39.555
Lorna, I'll talk to him and find out
what's going on, I promise.

17:39.640 --> 17:41.596
Oh...God...

17:43.000 --> 17:45.355
(Yelling, laughing)

17:45.440 --> 17:47.351
Outside!

17:47.440 --> 17:50.352
- What?
- Outside, please.

17:50.440 --> 17:52.396
(Grumbling)

17:57.520 --> 18:00.193
I want an orderly queue
formed here, please.

18:02.160 --> 18:05.630
My name is Mr Treneman
and I'm your new deputy head.

18:05.720 --> 18:06.789
(All) Oooh!

18:06.880 --> 18:09.075
I'm also here to help teach you English.

18:10.120 --> 18:12.111
- Who is Sarah Gilbert?
- Yeah.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.839
- Down the front there, please.
- Saddo.

18:14.920 --> 18:16.797
- Kelly Cathcart?
- Here.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.677
Down the front the other side, please.

18:18.760 --> 18:22.673
Er, sir, my name's Stacey Walsh
and me and Kelly always sit together.

18:22.760 --> 18:24.910
Yes, you always get grade Es together, too.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.673
Third desk on the right, please.

18:27.760 --> 18:30.718
Kevin Hogan? Back left, please.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.950
- Nadia Adamson.
- Here, sir.

18:33.040 --> 18:34.553
Second desk in the middle.

18:34.640 --> 18:37.074
Mark Hines? Anthony Hedges.

18:37.160 --> 18:39.993
Louise Pallit. Louise Pallit?

18:40.080 --> 18:41.911
Ben Crossley.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.956
Third desk on the right, please.

18:45.480 --> 18:47.835
You...right at the front.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.750
This is a load of crap, man.

18:54.840 --> 18:57.877
Oh, dear. My first detention.

18:57.960 --> 19:00.110
What, a detention just for saying ''crap''?

19:00.200 --> 19:01.997
(Laughter)

19:02.080 --> 19:04.036
For speaking
when I haven't asked you to.

19:04.120 --> 19:06.236
That's a hard-and-fast rule of mine.

19:06.320 --> 19:08.914
If you want to say something,
you put up your hand.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.630
Other than that, I expect silence. You'll use
lunch time to catch up on your spelling.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.632
- No way, man!
- You've just broken my rule again.

19:16.720 --> 19:19.871
- Tomorrow we'll do some comprehension.
- You're picking on me!

19:19.960 --> 19:22.349
Gosh, we are going to be seeing
a lot of each other.

19:22.440 --> 19:27.275
If I were you, I'd want to keep at least
one lunch break free this week.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.792
I'm sorry Donte's interrupted your lesson.

19:33.880 --> 19:37.634
I hate to think of your parents'
hard-earned taxes going to waste, so...

19:39.080 --> 19:40.832
let's get on, shall we?

19:47.200 --> 19:51.034
OK, ladies and gentlemen,
exercise books out, please.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.713
(Beeping)

20:11.160 --> 20:12.639
(Mobile )

20:12.720 --> 20:15.359
Dad? There's this new teacher
and he's picking on me.

20:15.440 --> 20:18.318
You really are a pest, Charles.
You can have this back on Friday.

20:18.400 --> 20:21.676
<i>- I was speaking to me dadI
- I don't care who you were speaking to.</i>

20:21.760 --> 20:25.673
<i>And will you please ask your dad
not to call during my class?</i>

20:28.760 --> 20:32.435
If we hadn't been gazumped, we'd be
enrolling her in Kingsbury College today.

20:32.520 --> 20:35.990
Well, you'll be pleased to hear that
we've just poached their Head of English

20:36.080 --> 20:38.310
for my new deputy. Andrew Treneman.

20:38.400 --> 20:42.313
Yes, we know. It's the only reason
Nicholas persuaded me to give you a trial.

20:43.520 --> 20:47.229
Well, we'll be delighted to offer Lucy
a place here, Mrs Seymour.

20:47.320 --> 20:50.232
Of course, we totally believe in
the comprehensive system.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.788
As so many people do, Mr Seymour.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.871
And then they move house to avoid it.

20:54.960 --> 20:56.916
Or they find God.

20:58.600 --> 21:03.355
We know we're just as guilty as the next,
but how can we condemn our daughter to this?

21:03.440 --> 21:07.353
52% haven't reached a satisfactory level
in basic reading skills.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.556
Oh, it was 55% last year, wasn't it?

21:10.520 --> 21:12.715
I'm sure Lucy's got no worries there.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.916
The great thing about
coming to a comprehensive

21:15.000 --> 21:17.036
is she's gonna see another side of life.

21:17.120 --> 21:20.715
And it's the greatest prep going
for Oxbridge these days, so I hear.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.756
Anyway, let me show you around.

21:22.840 --> 21:27.550
I'm sure that Mr Treneman
will be keen to make your acquaintance.

21:47.040 --> 21:49.600
I think that Scout
is scared of Boo Radley at first

21:49.680 --> 21:52.672
because he's so different to her and jem
and she doesn't unders...

21:52.760 --> 21:53.909
Oi!

21:54.000 --> 21:57.629
- Me son wants his mobile back.
- Excuse me?

21:57.720 --> 22:00.712
- You're not gonna give it him?
- Get out of my class.

22:00.800 --> 22:03.792
- just give me son his mobile back.
- That's not gonna happen.

22:03.880 --> 22:06.394
- It isn't a request.
- (Class ) Ooh!

22:08.200 --> 22:10.236
Can I have your attention, class?

22:10.320 --> 22:12.675
This...is what's known as a thug.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.318
You what? You...

22:20.000 --> 22:23.390
Now you know why his son
is a bully and a thief.

22:23.480 --> 22:24.959
He's not a...

22:25.040 --> 22:28.316
- Go on, Dad! Hit him!
- (Yelling)

22:31.880 --> 22:33.836
Certainly well equipped with computers.

22:33.920 --> 22:37.390
Yeah, one in every classroom soon.
And electronic whiteboards.

22:37.480 --> 22:39.516
Private sector's lagging behind us there.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.830
See? The Government's kept
some of its promises.

22:41.920 --> 22:45.515
Mm. Maybe this place isn't so bad.
I mean, Kingsbury don't have them.

22:45.600 --> 22:48.751
I think you'll find they're missing
their Head of English, too.

22:48.840 --> 22:50.159
(Shouting)

22:50.240 --> 22:53.118
Why don't I get Mr Treneman
to come out and chat to you?

22:53.200 --> 22:57.910
Ah, Miss Haydock. Would you like to show
our guests around your new language lab?

22:58.000 --> 23:00.434
Maybe Lucy would like to try on
your headphones.

23:00.520 --> 23:04.593
- Of course, Headmaster.
- Perhaps you'd like a go. It's a lot of fun.

23:04.680 --> 23:07.638
- What's going on in there?
- Forget it! We'll try somewhere else.

23:07.720 --> 23:11.474
- Look, there's really no need...
- It's a shambles, Mr Rimmer.

23:26.080 --> 23:29.038
- Oh, er, how's Lorna?
- Hey?

23:29.120 --> 23:33.079
Somebody said she'd had to go home.
Another of her migraines?

23:33.160 --> 23:36.436
Oh. Right. Thanks.

23:37.800 --> 23:40.758
Right, well, I hope she feels better soon.

23:56.120 --> 23:58.395
(Cheering)

23:58.480 --> 24:01.119
Let me... just you wait!

24:01.200 --> 24:03.873
- Untie me bloody hands!
- Out!

24:04.760 --> 24:06.716
What are you lot laughing at?

24:11.320 --> 24:13.390
This is gonna come in useful, after all.

24:15.560 --> 24:17.516
Yes. Police, please.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.157
The stupid prat, man.
He made a right arse of himself, and me.

24:24.240 --> 24:27.516
- Been brilliant to have seen it.
- Suppose he goes down for it?

24:27.600 --> 24:29.955
No, your dad'll do him
if he presses charges.

24:30.040 --> 24:33.874
- Look, I'd better go.
- just tell the snobby git to get lost.

24:33.960 --> 24:37.953
- Oh, yeah, get another load of detention.
- Bothered? D'you want me to tell him?

24:38.040 --> 24:42.192
No. If he's chucked me dad in the nick,
I'll slit his throat for him.

24:48.600 --> 24:51.910
Snooty little sod
didn't even have an apology for me.

24:52.760 --> 24:55.194
job should have been yours, mate.
There's no two ways.

24:55.280 --> 24:57.635
Mm, Treneman's welcome to it.

24:58.560 --> 25:00.869
So long as he doesn't
go doubling my workload.

25:01.800 --> 25:05.156
If you ask me, we need to recruit
a division of the Paras

25:05.240 --> 25:08.277
if they want us to drill anything
into those little brickheads.

25:09.840 --> 25:11.751
Tom. Hi, Grantly.

25:11.840 --> 25:13.558
We need a chat.

25:13.640 --> 25:16.552
- A pint of lager, please.
- And another for me, mate, please.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.596
- Grantly?
- Mm-mm.

25:18.680 --> 25:20.636
I'm off to lose a tenner.

25:22.360 --> 25:25.033
- Have you got cancer?
- What?

25:25.120 --> 25:28.112
- just... Have you, Tom, or not?
- No, of course I haven't.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.919
Have you got any other disease
or medical problem?

25:31.000 --> 25:32.479
Not that I'm aware of.

25:33.480 --> 25:36.358
Well, then, you've definitely got
somebody else, haven't you?

25:37.320 --> 25:40.869
Come on, Tom, don't muck about. Since
when does a bloke blow out a relationship

25:40.960 --> 25:43.110
and a shared mortgage
to go and cope on his own?

25:43.200 --> 25:46.909
- I haven't got somebody else.
- Then why the hell can't you marry Lorna?

25:47.000 --> 25:48.956
I told her why.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.110
Well, then, you'd better sit down and tell me.

25:51.200 --> 25:53.156
Because this is not stacking up.

25:57.800 --> 25:59.677
Stupid...

26:05.280 --> 26:07.840
- Sergeant Hendy.
- That's all I need.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.833
- Make a habit of this, do you?
- I'd rather leave it to you chaps.

26:13.360 --> 26:16.989
Dear, oh dear, Clarence.
Been throwing your weight around again?

26:17.080 --> 26:19.071
Three times
he punched my colleague here,

26:19.160 --> 26:22.038
- in front of a classroom of 16-year-olds.
- That right?

26:22.120 --> 26:25.510
Oh, by the way, you do not have to say
anything, but anything you do say...

26:25.600 --> 26:28.831
No, don't bother. I'm guilty, I hit him.
He's a tosser.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.797
I confess, all right?

26:30.880 --> 26:33.553
Not surprising,
given there were 30 witnesses.

26:33.640 --> 26:37.315
Well, that was easy.
Take him down the station and charge him.

26:38.520 --> 26:40.272
Get off. Get off.

26:40.360 --> 26:43.591
With his previous, you won't be
seeing him again this side of 2010.

26:44.680 --> 26:46.477
Good.

26:47.480 --> 26:50.040
Erm, I'd better be getting back
to my classroom.

26:50.120 --> 26:53.556
- I've got Donte Charles in detention.
- Great. More hassle.

26:53.640 --> 26:56.200
- Sorry?
- I was off my truck, recruiting you.

26:56.280 --> 26:59.590
Here half a day and that's the second time
you've had the police round.

26:59.680 --> 27:02.069
- I'm sorry?
- I had two reject parents

27:02.160 --> 27:04.594
from your Kingsbury College
in this morning,

27:04.680 --> 27:07.877
this close to their daughter giving us
a boost up the league table

27:07.960 --> 27:10.235
until they heard the rumpus
from your classroom.

27:10.320 --> 27:12.595
- You lost them.
- No, you lost them!

27:14.160 --> 27:16.116
Are you trying to sabotage me?

27:16.200 --> 27:19.510
I'm trying to help you establish
zero tolerance of bad behaviour!

27:19.600 --> 27:21.909
That's how you'll attract
middle-class parents -

27:22.000 --> 27:23.274
by laying down some rules
and damn well sticking to them.

27:24.760 --> 27:26.432
Which is what I'm off to do.

27:26.520 --> 27:29.114
You carry on like this,
you'll have a punch-up every week!

27:29.200 --> 27:32.476
If that's what it takes.
I've got the stomach for it.

27:33.600 --> 27:36.034
But if every decision I take
is going to be undermined

27:36.120 --> 27:39.078
by the very person who
should be giving me his support...

27:41.520 --> 27:45.433
Look, Izzie, this is none of your business.
It's between me and Lorna.

27:45.520 --> 27:48.318
I've just had to try and
talk her out of killing herself.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.436
I'm supposed to be her bridesmaid on Saturday.

27:50.520 --> 27:54.229
I've been involved in every sodding detail
of your wedding from day one.

27:55.520 --> 27:57.078
I'm sorry.

27:57.160 --> 28:00.357
You don't suddenly tell the woman
you're marrying you're not in love with her.

28:00.440 --> 28:03.159
What the hell else do you do?
Lie and go ahead with it?

28:03.240 --> 28:05.913
Well, you're obviously lying about something.

28:07.120 --> 28:09.190
- I thought I loved her, didn't I?
- What?

28:09.280 --> 28:11.953
And then suddenly, this morning,
you realised you didn't?

28:12.040 --> 28:13.996
No, not just like...

28:14.920 --> 28:18.833
It's obviously myself I've been lying to.
I feel sick about it.

28:21.080 --> 28:23.036
If you'd been having second thoughts,

28:23.120 --> 28:25.839
you should have said something to Lorna
straight off.

28:28.720 --> 28:31.075
I'm just trying do the right thing by her now.

28:33.360 --> 28:36.079
I hope one day she'll be glad about it.

28:36.160 --> 28:37.912
Get real.

28:41.880 --> 28:43.916
There is someone else, isn't there?

28:46.760 --> 28:48.512
Fine.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.956
If you wanna make me say it...

28:52.960 --> 28:55.997
- Yeah, there is.
- Oh, jesus, Tom. I knew it.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.879
Who is it?

29:03.920 --> 29:07.435
If you're so bloody clever, you should be
able to work it out, shouldn't you?

29:08.680 --> 29:10.033
Work out what?

29:52.320 --> 29:54.629
- Izzie. Izzie, wait!
- Sod off, Tom.

29:54.720 --> 29:57.837
- You said I should've talked about it.
- Yeah, go and talk to Lorna.

29:57.920 --> 30:00.798
Look, please... We can't leave it like this.

30:00.880 --> 30:04.634
Well, I can. just don't you ever tell Lorna
what you've just told me.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.631
It's the truth. I love you.

30:08.960 --> 30:11.793
- Rubbish.
- I want you to tell me the truth now.

30:11.880 --> 30:14.075
Tell me what you really feel about me.

30:15.520 --> 30:18.717
Don't you dare think of
blaming any of this on me.

30:26.680 --> 30:29.069
Andrew, can I have a quick word?

30:38.280 --> 30:43.035
Erm...I'd rather you didn't
use my first name in front of the pupils.

30:43.120 --> 30:44.997
What, a state secret, is it?

30:45.080 --> 30:47.389
Perhaps you haven't heard of
the old proverb,

30:47.480 --> 30:49.436
''Familiarity breeds contempt.''

30:49.520 --> 30:52.034
Mm...no. No, you got me there.

30:52.120 --> 30:54.759
Maybe I should have gone to
a posh school like yours.

30:54.840 --> 30:58.037
Whatever advantages I've had,
I'm trying to share them with these kids.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.953
Beginning to understand
why you got a punch in the mouth.

31:01.040 --> 31:02.109
Wait a minute!

31:02.200 --> 31:05.272
I haven't got time to discuss your hang-ups.
I need to speak to Donte.

31:05.360 --> 31:08.511
I've had his social worker on
and he's got to go into care tonight.

31:08.600 --> 31:09.953
Crikey.

31:10.040 --> 31:13.794
- Why?
- Because his father's in a police cell.

31:14.840 --> 31:18.435
He's a single parent.
Er, the mother walked out four years ago.

31:19.120 --> 31:21.634
- He's brought his son up on his own.
- Oh.

31:22.920 --> 31:26.276
Did you not think of the consequences
before you decided to confront him?

31:26.360 --> 31:30.353
He assaulted me. What is it here?
You've lost sight of what's right and wrong.

31:30.440 --> 31:32.396
Excuse me, I'm not gonna be lectured.

31:32.480 --> 31:35.074
These kids know they can create hell
and get away with it,

31:35.160 --> 31:38.197
thanks to teachers like you explaining it away.

31:38.280 --> 31:41.909
Have you any idea what we're dealing with
at Waterloo Road?

31:43.080 --> 31:45.640
70% of our kids
are from single-parent homes.

31:45.720 --> 31:48.234
- It doesn't mean they shouldn't behave.
- No, it doesn't.

31:48.320 --> 31:50.550
But it causes difficulties.

31:50.640 --> 31:52.995
22 of our kids are on ASBOs.

31:53.080 --> 31:55.310
God knows what percentage are on drugs.

31:55.400 --> 31:58.472
We've got the highest underage pregnancy rate
in the whole country.

31:58.560 --> 32:01.632
- Basically, we're talking poverty.
- If you lower your expectations

32:01.720 --> 32:04.029
of what poor kids can achieve,
they'll stay poor.

32:04.120 --> 32:07.396
Yeah, and meanwhile, in the real world,
we've got a kid about to go into care

32:07.480 --> 32:09.789
because of your back-to-basics rubbish.

32:10.640 --> 32:12.471
Oh, another statistic for you.

32:12.560 --> 32:16.553
Over 50% of kids in care end up in prison,
so well done, Andrew.

32:16.640 --> 32:18.756
You've made such a difference already.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.357
Kim.

32:24.040 --> 32:26.713
Obviously, I don't want the boy put into care.

32:35.440 --> 32:37.317
(Bell)

32:38.880 --> 32:41.872
- Hi. We're looking for Clarence Charles.
- Are you his lawyer?

32:41.960 --> 32:44.872
No, I'm his son's pastoral care teacher.
Kim Campbell.

32:44.960 --> 32:47.633
This is Mr Treneman,
the victim of his assault.

32:47.720 --> 32:51.269
- Can we speak to him?
- He's not the chatty type.

32:51.360 --> 32:53.794
We've got a proposition
that he'll want to listen to.

32:56.720 --> 32:59.837
Miss Campbell, what are you doing here?

32:59.920 --> 33:00.955
Oh.

33:01.040 --> 33:04.794
I suggest you sit down, keep your trap shut
and your ears open, Charles.

33:06.080 --> 33:08.036
We're both here for your son's benefit.

33:09.560 --> 33:11.039
He's a thief.

33:11.120 --> 33:14.271
Have you ever had to confiscate anything
from Donte, Mr Charles?

33:14.360 --> 33:16.351
Presumably as a punishment
for something.

33:16.440 --> 33:18.032
Yeah, sometimes.

33:18.120 --> 33:20.714
Right, well, while your child
is at our school,

33:20.800 --> 33:23.155
right, we treat him like our own child.

33:23.240 --> 33:28.792
Yeah? We care for him and, like a parent,
sometimes have to discipline them.

33:30.240 --> 33:32.834
Do you think he should've been using
his phone in class?

33:32.920 --> 33:34.956
He had his reasons.

33:35.040 --> 33:39.591
And so do 29 other pupils, which is why
nobody is allowed to use their phone.

33:40.480 --> 33:42.357
Surely you can see that.

33:42.440 --> 33:45.193
- He called me a thug.
- That's how you behaved.

33:45.280 --> 33:49.398
What do you call someone who punches
people in the face for no good reason?

33:49.480 --> 33:52.677
Look, I'm not proud of what I done, right?
I lost it.

33:52.760 --> 33:54.751
But if my boy asks me for back-up...

33:54.840 --> 33:56.990
You need anger-management classes,
Mr Charles.

33:57.080 --> 33:59.355
Yeah, and I'm gonna get 'em inside,
aren't I?

34:00.600 --> 34:02.033
And while you're inside,

34:02.120 --> 34:05.396
your son is gonna be bedding down
in a local-authority home.

34:09.360 --> 34:12.795
Look...I'm prepared
to give you a second chance.

34:14.239 --> 34:18.438
Drop all the charges
if you're prepared to cooperate.

34:24.120 --> 34:27.635
Today, there was a very serious assault
on a member of my staff.

34:29.880 --> 34:32.553
The man who assaulted him
would like to say something.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.918
- (Microphone feedback)
- Me name's Clarence Charles.

34:44.960 --> 34:47.713
I want to apologise to Mr Treneman,

34:47.800 --> 34:51.110
and anybody in his class,
for my assault on him this morning.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.791
I was out of order.

34:54.880 --> 34:56.835
He could have got me sent to prison

34:56.920 --> 34:59.593
and me son, Donte, put into care.

35:00.920 --> 35:03.195
So I'm very lucky to be let off.

35:04.600 --> 35:07.194
Cos it's not worth it for a stupid mobile...

35:08.040 --> 35:09.996
which shouldn't be used in lessons.

35:10.720 --> 35:12.073
Right, son?

35:13.760 --> 35:16.558
And I'll see he doesn't do it again,
Mr Rimmer.

35:16.640 --> 35:18.835
I give you me word. Thank you.

35:22.760 --> 35:27.151
just so you know,
this is now a zero-tolerance school

35:27.240 --> 35:29.196
for violence against teachers.

35:30.320 --> 35:33.073
There's a big sign
going up outside the gates -

35:33.160 --> 35:36.152
''We always prosecute violent parents.''

35:36.240 --> 35:41.075
And we will exclude any pupil
whose parents assault my staff.

35:43.920 --> 35:46.354
So go home and tell your mums and dads.

35:46.440 --> 35:48.396
I'm not having it.

35:51.480 --> 35:53.835
Teachers, dismiss your tutor groups.

35:59.080 --> 36:01.071
Thanks for saving the day, Kim.

36:02.320 --> 36:04.788
I suppose I should thank you, too.

36:04.880 --> 36:06.632
If you want to.

36:06.720 --> 36:08.676
Oh, God, you're tricky.

36:11.920 --> 36:15.117
Come on, son, let's get summat to eat.
We've got a lot to talk about, yeah?

36:15.200 --> 36:18.670
You what? You just disrespected me
in front of the whole school.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.830
Ain't going nowhere wi' you.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.397
(Mobile )

36:41.720 --> 36:45.918
<i>- Hello?
- Iz? It's me. Did you speak to Tom?</i>

36:47.120 --> 36:50.556
Yeah. Er, Lorna, can I ring you back?
I'm driving.

36:50.640 --> 36:52.392
<i>Sorry.</i>

36:54.520 --> 36:58.308
- Get out.
- For God's sake. Please, just listen to me.

36:59.480 --> 37:01.630
Hurry up.

37:01.720 --> 37:05.110
I've been fighting these feelings
for months. Honest.

37:05.200 --> 37:08.351
But it's not a daft crush.
You're the point of my day.

37:09.720 --> 37:12.632
- I've tried to get you out of my head, but...
- Well, try harder.

37:12.720 --> 37:14.551
What, that's all you've got to say?

37:14.640 --> 37:17.279
What d'you want me to say? ''Move in''?

37:18.640 --> 37:20.870
I want to know what you want
in your life, Izzie.

37:21.720 --> 37:25.110
Cos I don't think I've cooked up
these feelings all by myself.

37:25.200 --> 37:29.034
D'you know, it's almost funny.
You don't know the first thing about my life.

37:29.120 --> 37:31.076
In fact, I don't have a bloody life.

37:31.160 --> 37:33.628
I've got a job and two kids
and that's all I can cope with,

37:33.720 --> 37:37.838
so why don't you take your feelings away
from me and give them back to Lorna?

37:38.880 --> 37:40.677
Now go.

37:41.920 --> 37:43.717
OK.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.911
All right, girls?

37:46.000 --> 37:47.877
Night, Izzie.

37:52.040 --> 37:54.315
- What did he want?
- Nothing.

37:55.200 --> 37:59.079
- Why was he sat in our car, then?
- It's none of your business.

37:59.160 --> 38:01.116
Have you two had an argument?

38:02.000 --> 38:04.753
Mum. Mum!

38:04.840 --> 38:07.593
- I'm talking to you.
- Well, I'm not talking to you.

38:15.120 --> 38:17.588
Mum, are you gonna make us something?

38:17.680 --> 38:19.910
Er, yeah, just a minute.

38:29.920 --> 38:31.672
Tom. Bloody Tom.

38:31.760 --> 38:33.557
(Phone )

38:42.920 --> 38:48.358
Iz? Iz, I'm really sorry to bother you again
but I have to know. Did you speak to Tom?

38:50.960 --> 38:52.712
Yeah, I did.

38:53.600 --> 38:57.354
And you're gonna have to promise me that
you won't tell Tom what I'm gonna tell you.

38:58.600 --> 39:01.398
<i>I think he's just worried
that he's lost the old you.</i>

39:01.480 --> 39:03.436
Is that what he said?

39:04.800 --> 39:06.153
Yeah.

39:06.240 --> 39:08.151
Thanks, Izzie.

39:22.320 --> 39:24.072
Lorna?

39:29.360 --> 39:30.713
Lorna?

39:52.440 --> 39:54.271
Come here.

39:56.800 --> 40:01.476
I just want to prove to you that
being married doesn't mean not sexy.

40:01.560 --> 40:05.269
- Look, what I said today...
- I know I've been hung up lately.

40:05.360 --> 40:08.875
- But not any more, I promise.
- I don't think this is a good idea.

40:08.960 --> 40:11.633
Your foxy lady's back
and she wants her man.

40:11.720 --> 40:14.712
- I've got some marking to do.
- You're nearly as bad as me.

40:14.800 --> 40:16.756
Come on, tiger.

40:23.320 --> 40:26.471
You see? You do still love me.

40:28.640 --> 40:30.551
(Tom sighs )

40:34.040 --> 40:35.996
I need a shower.

40:54.760 --> 40:56.716
Izzie, it's me.

40:58.640 --> 41:01.916
I need to hear you tell me one more time,
just to be sure.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.959
Is there any chance for me with you?
Any chance at all?.

41:12.960 --> 41:14.791
Hello?

41:16.320 --> 41:21.519
Is this clear enough for you, Tom?
You've got no chance.

41:22.560 --> 41:26.394
<i>Truth is, I just don't fancy you.</i>

41:45.640 --> 41:48.074
- (Crowd) Hooray!
- Hooray!

41:48.160 --> 41:49.957
(Wolf-whistles )

41:59.600 --> 42:01.955
To my big brother, Ian,

42:02.040 --> 42:05.953
for coming all the way over from
Sydney, Australia, to be the best man.

42:06.040 --> 42:08.110
To my nieces, Katy and Sarah,

42:08.200 --> 42:10.873
for being such beautiful bridesmaids.

42:12.080 --> 42:15.709
And, erm...for all her hard work
and unstinting support...

42:16.600 --> 42:20.479
the best woman, and our best friend, Izzie.

42:22.960 --> 42:24.598
Only she knows

42:24.680 --> 42:28.559
how much Lorna and I owe her for...
helping us be here today.

42:30.520 --> 42:32.351
She's been our rock

42:32.440 --> 42:34.192
and, er...

42:35.960 --> 42:37.678
Well, she knows.

42:37.760 --> 42:41.196
So, ladies and gentlemen,
if you'll join me in raising your glasses.

42:41.840 --> 42:44.354
To the best man and the bridesmaids.

42:44.440 --> 42:46.510
(All) Best man and bridesmaids.

42:50.760 --> 42:53.194
<i>- (Snoring)
- (Laughter on TV)</i>

43:08.360 --> 43:10.316
<i>(TV on )</i>

43:12.440 --> 43:13.839
(Mobile beeping)

43:13.920 --> 43:15.956
We should all have been at this wedding.

43:16.040 --> 43:18.190
(Man ) Your mum said
you didn't want to go.

43:18.280 --> 43:20.271
Didn't wanna go cos she wouldn't go with you.

43:21.160 --> 43:24.869
Can't stop me taking you out for treats,
though. We'll still have a good time.

43:24.960 --> 43:27.428
- When?
- Oh, I'll fix something up.

43:27.520 --> 43:31.399
- Why don't you go back to Shelley, Dad?
- I don't think so.

43:31.480 --> 43:33.630
Well, why don't we all go back to Dad's?

43:33.720 --> 43:35.551
Don't be daft.

43:35.640 --> 43:37.870
We're fine as we are here.

43:37.960 --> 43:40.394
We are. Flip's sake.

43:40.480 --> 43:44.439
Mika's 16. She could join the army
and get killed in Iraq.

43:44.520 --> 43:48.115
- Oh, thanks.
- You reckon your mother wouldn't mind?

43:48.200 --> 43:51.909
- Only watching telly.
- I'll have to check with her first.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.355
- Who cares what she says?
- Hey.

43:55.520 --> 43:59.115
Mind you, she'll probably accuse me
of spoiling her evening.

43:59.200 --> 44:01.316
I'll just see where Shelley's at.

44:04.400 --> 44:06.356
I'm going to my room.

44:07.320 --> 44:09.709
I first met Lorna when we were students.

44:09.800 --> 44:13.429
She found me crying my eyes out in the
union loos, cos I'd had my handbag stolen

44:13.520 --> 44:16.034
and all I wanted to do was walk under a bus.

44:16.120 --> 44:19.157
But Lorna said it might be better
if I reported the theft,

44:19.240 --> 44:22.516
cancelled my credit cards,
applied for an emergency subsistence grant

44:22.600 --> 44:24.556
and let her buy me a drink.

44:26.120 --> 44:27.951
Well, that's my idea of a true friend.

44:29.240 --> 44:31.595
And so is my other best mate there - Tom.

44:32.760 --> 44:36.514
In fact...I'd say he was the perfect man.

44:36.600 --> 44:38.875
If only he'd give up Man City
and support Newcastle.

44:40.920 --> 44:43.878
Anyway...they're perfect together.

44:45.120 --> 44:47.953
So, to Lorna and Tom.

44:48.040 --> 44:50.031
(All) To Lorna and Tom.

44:51.520 --> 44:53.272
(Chatting)

45:01.280 --> 45:03.475
<i>( # Dance music)</i>

45:22.200 --> 45:24.156
Don't they make a lovely couple?

45:24.240 --> 45:26.549
Yeah. Great.

45:26.640 --> 45:29.279
I reckon we will, too. Don't you, jack?

45:30.120 --> 45:31.473
Uh?

45:31.560 --> 45:34.677
Well, I'm gonna be getting you
on that dance floor, don't you worry.

45:34.760 --> 45:36.716
And no wriggling out.

45:55.800 --> 46:00.032
You be in bed no later than 11:30, right?

46:00.120 --> 46:02.111
Yeah, safe as, Dad.

46:03.760 --> 46:07.036
(Yawns ) I'm knackered.
Think I might go to bed now.

46:07.120 --> 46:09.270
- See you soon.
- See you, Dad.

46:13.080 --> 46:14.832
Lock the door!

46:16.560 --> 46:17.913
It's done.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.956
- Night-night, babe.
- Night.

46:29.680 --> 46:31.477
(Mobile )

46:34.640 --> 46:36.198
<i>Donte?</i>

46:36.280 --> 46:38.589
I'm free. Finally.

46:38.680 --> 46:41.148
(Whispers ) Great. I'll see you in ten, babe.

47:04.640 --> 47:06.471
May I have the honour?

47:06.560 --> 47:10.109
Oh, can you not just drop
the upper-class twit act for one second?

47:10.200 --> 47:13.749
Technically, I'm middle class.
My dad's a dentist.

47:14.640 --> 47:16.835
Twit...obviously can't be helped.

47:19.800 --> 47:22.519
Come on, sit down. Have a drink.

47:23.520 --> 47:25.909
Tell me something else
that I don't know about you.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.353
Well, er...

47:28.400 --> 47:30.356
Did VSO in Rwanda.

47:30.440 --> 47:32.431
That must score a merit in your books.

47:33.840 --> 47:37.674
From Rwanda to Waterloo Road.
You like a challenge, don't you?

47:37.760 --> 47:41.719
Actually, I'd much rather
everyone just did things my way.

47:41.800 --> 47:45.076
Oh, I don't intend on giving you an easy life.

47:45.160 --> 47:47.037
I gathered that.

47:48.400 --> 47:50.356
D'you fancy a twirl, Kim?

47:51.240 --> 47:53.470
I'm all right. Thank you. Ta.

48:00.320 --> 48:02.709
- You've been so brilliant, Izzie.
- Oh, shh...

48:02.800 --> 48:05.792
No, you have. We wouldn't even
be here today if it wasn't for you.

48:05.880 --> 48:08.713
Oh, come on. Tom would have
come to his own senses.

48:08.800 --> 48:11.917
Anyway, he did. And that's what matters.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.638
Talk about scary, though.

48:13.720 --> 48:16.792
I should have expected him to do
a last-minute wobbly on me, though.

48:16.880 --> 48:19.553
D'you remember his 25th?
He wouldn't let me send out invites.

48:19.640 --> 48:22.313
It's like he's allergic to
even saying the word ''tomorrow''.

48:22.400 --> 48:24.630
Well, he signed up for it today.

48:26.640 --> 48:29.552
Look, erm, I'd better go
and check on jimmy and the girls.

48:37.400 --> 48:39.277
jimmy, is everything OK?

48:40.400 --> 48:43.517
What? Wait a minute,
I can't hear what you're saying. What?

48:45.320 --> 48:47.390
What d'you mean, you've gone home?

48:51.880 --> 48:54.792
<i>(DJ) And here's one
to get you all in the romantic mood.</i>

48:54.880 --> 48:56.871
Ooh!

48:56.960 --> 49:00.032
- I think you've had enough, Miss Haydock.
- No, I haven't!

49:16.560 --> 49:18.073
(Car horn )

49:18.920 --> 49:20.717
Yeah, I'm coming!

49:26.480 --> 49:28.471
Tell Mum I've gone to bed.

49:28.560 --> 49:30.790
- You've had it, Chlo.
- Yeah, yeah.

49:31.720 --> 49:33.676
Hurry up, Chlo, come on.

49:37.080 --> 49:39.036
You're looking fine, girl.

49:39.120 --> 49:41.111
(Girl) Come on, Chlo,
what you waiting for?

49:41.960 --> 49:44.872
- Your carriage awaits, my lady.
- Thank you.

49:44.960 --> 49:47.918
- You all right?
- Yo! Yo! Yo! Fasten your seat belts, man!

49:48.000 --> 49:49.956
- It's time to party!
- Whoo!

49:55.280 --> 49:57.191
Izzie?

50:02.640 --> 50:04.596
I thought you'd quit the fags.

50:04.680 --> 50:06.477
Yeah, well, I lied, didn't I?

50:10.560 --> 50:12.676
What's up?

50:12.760 --> 50:15.274
just the usual. jimmy.

50:16.240 --> 50:18.800
I've got to get back to the girls.
I've called a cab.

50:19.680 --> 50:21.875
Like I told you, my mess of a life.

50:25.200 --> 50:27.236
Anything I can do for you, Izzie...

50:28.480 --> 50:30.391
Any time.

50:35.320 --> 50:37.231
All I said today...

50:39.040 --> 50:40.996
about you and Lorna...

50:42.840 --> 50:47.868
I meant it.
I just want you both to be really happy.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.956
I know that.

50:54.680 --> 50:57.433
And I'm really gonna try and make it work.

50:57.520 --> 50:59.476
Well, you better had.

51:02.200 --> 51:04.668
- Oh, just sod off, will you?
- Please.

51:19.360 --> 51:21.316
(Car draws up)

51:21.400 --> 51:24.119
- No, no! What am I doing?
- Izzie, wait.

51:24.880 --> 51:26.791
Hold that cab.

51:27.880 --> 51:31.475
Miss Redpath, can you drop
Miss Haydock off on your way home?

51:31.560 --> 51:34.120
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Right, OK.
- Ooh-ooh!

51:38.520 --> 51:40.272
Good night.

51:59.360 --> 52:02.557
- (Girl laughing) You all right, Chlo?
- I am. Are you?

52:02.640 --> 52:05.154
Chlo, you're looking sexy tonight, girl!

52:05.240 --> 52:07.196
- Turn the music up, man.
- Come on, turn it up!

52:07.280 --> 52:10.352
- All right, chill, chill.
- This song is well good!

52:10.440 --> 52:11.998
Is that loud enough?

52:12.080 --> 52:14.389
- Come on! Up a bit more!
- Louder!

52:14.480 --> 52:16.357
There you go.

52:16.440 --> 52:18.749
That's what I'm talking about, man!

52:18.840 --> 52:20.990
But, see, the problem with you

52:21.080 --> 52:23.878
is that you don't even think
you've got a problem.

52:23.960 --> 52:27.669
Education isn't a science.
You can't just bung x and y together

52:27.760 --> 52:30.479
and get z. All children are different.

52:30.560 --> 52:33.279
Are they? I like to emphasise
what makes them the same.

52:33.360 --> 52:36.193
- But you... Oh, you can't!
- Sorry. Andrew.

52:37.200 --> 52:39.395
- Yes?
- Are you sober?

52:39.480 --> 52:40.674
Yes. Why?

52:40.760 --> 52:43.797
Well, I'm not. And I've just had
a call from the cops.

52:43.880 --> 52:45.757
There's been some incident at the school.

52:55.200 --> 52:57.919
- Hey, Chlo, you drinking tonight?
- Hell, yeah!

52:58.000 --> 52:59.877
Attagirl, man!

52:59.960 --> 53:02.713
- Hey, Chlo, come in the front.
- Yay!

53:04.760 --> 53:06.716
You all right?

53:08.480 --> 53:10.277
You getting through?

53:11.160 --> 53:13.230
(Girl) Oh, my God, Chlo, what you doing?

53:15.120 --> 53:17.076
- Whoa! Look out!
- (Horn )

53:18.320 --> 53:20.038
Cool!

53:20.120 --> 53:21.519
You idiot!

53:21.600 --> 53:23.158
(Laughing)

53:24.280 --> 53:27.238
Police said it was three teenagers
from the estate.

53:30.720 --> 53:33.393
Every blasted thing
they could swing a hammer at.

53:34.480 --> 53:36.436
Pretty purposeful.

53:38.960 --> 53:41.315
Izzie's Year 8s worked on this for weeks.

53:43.480 --> 53:45.277
You see what we're up against now?

53:46.480 --> 53:49.677
This is the aggro we have to deal with,
day in, day out!

53:51.720 --> 53:55.110
just fill in another insurance claim,
that's all you can do!

53:57.120 --> 54:00.430
If I could get me hands on
the little scumbags now!

54:00.520 --> 54:02.590
I've had it up to here with 'em!

54:05.760 --> 54:09.275
- Come on.
- Look around you. It's too late!

54:10.160 --> 54:12.515
All you can do is pick up the pieces.

54:12.600 --> 54:15.034
What, so we just...write them off, do we?

54:15.120 --> 54:18.237
- You've got no idea, have you?
- Listen to yourself.

54:19.120 --> 54:23.352
If you really don't believe
that we can make a difference, resign.

54:23.440 --> 54:25.749
Walk away. Let them rot.

54:28.680 --> 54:30.636
What is it with you?
Why are you doing this?

54:32.400 --> 54:34.630
- Well, it's not for the money.
- Why?

54:34.720 --> 54:36.153
Because...

54:37.640 --> 54:39.949
this is the career I chose.

54:41.760 --> 54:44.558
And...kids like these

54:44.640 --> 54:46.676
have most need of good teachers.

54:48.200 --> 54:51.476
Teachers who...don't underestimate them.

54:53.160 --> 54:57.915
There's plenty of proof.
It's possible to turn schools like this around.

55:00.920 --> 55:02.956
You don't know what it's like

55:03.040 --> 55:05.634
to stand in front of a class every day

55:05.720 --> 55:09.554
and to know that not one child,
and I mean not one,

55:09.640 --> 55:11.596
will even reach grade E.

55:13.600 --> 55:15.716
Well, let's make that our first task.

55:18.600 --> 55:21.512
One grade E at Key Stage 4.

55:23.960 --> 55:25.916
It's an improvement, isn't it?

55:28.640 --> 55:32.155
We could be really ambitious
and make it a D.

55:40.480 --> 55:43.438
The school could be closed
by the end of the year, anyway.

55:45.760 --> 55:47.716
So we have a deal?.

55:51.520 --> 55:54.080
I can't make deals
without a drink in me hand.

56:11.520 --> 56:15.274
- You've had too much to drink, man!
- I can't hear you. What you saying?

56:16.840 --> 56:18.592
Yes!

56:18.960 --> 56:20.916
(All talking at once )

56:25.440 --> 56:26.668
(Horn )

56:30.040 --> 56:31.996
What are you doing in there?

56:36.320 --> 56:38.276
Having a fight?

56:39.120 --> 56:41.839
I broke a glass and knocked the bin. Sorry.

56:42.840 --> 56:46.230
Oh, it's just as well I'm not waiting
to lose my virginity tonight.

56:47.840 --> 56:49.831
Blame Grantly Budgen.

56:49.920 --> 56:52.753
No wonder his wife eats for two.
All he does is drink.

56:54.680 --> 56:56.636
It's funny you should say that.

56:57.720 --> 57:00.314
Because somebody else
is eating for two now.

57:04.280 --> 57:06.840
Nobody can say
that's why we got married, can they?

57:06.920 --> 57:10.629
Because you couldn't have been
forced by a fact you didn't know about.

57:10.720 --> 57:13.109
That's why I made myself wait until tonight.

57:14.160 --> 57:16.720
So I knew you really wanted to marry me.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.752
What are you saying?

57:23.080 --> 57:25.230
I'm pregnant.

57:26.480 --> 57:28.948
You're going to be a father, Tom.

57:34.680 --> 57:38.514
I don't want some poxy rose!
I just want my twin brother!

57:38.600 --> 57:40.750
I just want my brother back!

57:40.840 --> 57:42.592
You snidey cow!

57:42.680 --> 57:45.558
- You don't talk to her like that!
- I'll talk to her how I want!

57:48.400 --> 57:50.960
- Feeling naughty, Miss Haydock?
- (Shrieks )
