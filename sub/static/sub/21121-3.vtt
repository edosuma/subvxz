08:33.443 --> 08:36.168
Let me know if that
abdominal pain returns.

08:38.058 --> 08:40.841
[Sighs] I'm gonna need
you to prepare him.

08:40.866 --> 08:42.238
The state of that arm...

08:42.263 --> 08:44.524
I don't think we're gonna
be able to save his hand.

08:45.548 --> 08:47.566
Great. His job's hard
enough to do with two hands.

08:47.591 --> 08:48.559
How's he going to do it with one?

08:48.584 --> 08:50.004
Maybe the tests will
tell a different story,

08:50.029 --> 08:53.137
- but I wouldn't count on it.
- [Bin lid opens]

08:53.862 --> 08:56.670
[Siren wailing]

08:56.695 --> 08:59.402
- How you doing, Travis?
- [Groans] It hurts.

08:59.427 --> 09:01.355
Morphine will help with that.

09:01.380 --> 09:03.480
You took a hell of a
chance out there tonight.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.809
That pump jack slips,
you could have been caught.

09:05.834 --> 09:07.066
I try not to think about it.

09:07.091 --> 09:09.441
Maybe you should before
you go up there again.

09:09.466 --> 09:12.233
So it's okay for <i>you</i> to go out there,
but not for me?

09:12.258 --> 09:15.692
Yes, because I'm... more expendable.

09:15.717 --> 09:18.085
Wow. You don't have a God
complex like the rest of us?

09:18.110 --> 09:21.441
I used to, but my old life
in <i>México</i> beat it out of me.

09:23.087 --> 09:24.854
It's pretty rough down there, huh?

09:24.879 --> 09:26.411
I was referring to my ex-wife.

09:26.436 --> 09:27.902
[Chuckles]

09:27.927 --> 09:31.328
Anyway, his BP is a little lower
'cause of the morphine.

09:31.353 --> 09:33.933
I'm gonna hang a liter,
if that's okay with you, Boss?

09:33.958 --> 09:36.258
[Siren continues wailing]

09:36.283 --> 09:38.058
[Monitor beeping steadily]

09:38.083 --> 09:41.363
What about Scott?
I thought my appointment was with him.

09:42.016 --> 09:44.718
Scott got pulled onto another case.

09:44.821 --> 09:47.262
Dr. Cummings and I
will take it from here.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.082
But I'll talk to him later, right?

09:49.241 --> 09:51.207
I-I think it'd be really good

09:51.232 --> 09:53.254
- if I talked to him about...
- You know what? We'll see.

09:53.279 --> 09:55.212
Right now let's just focus
on getting you better.

09:55.237 --> 09:56.435
- Okay?
- Okay.

09:56.460 --> 09:57.762
I understand you have a history

09:57.787 --> 09:59.371
of bicuspid aortic regurgitation,

09:59.396 --> 10:00.963
and you've been having chest pains.

10:00.988 --> 10:03.933
Yes, on and off. No pain now.

10:03.958 --> 10:05.886
Okay. Well, we'll do a
cardiac workup with an echo

10:05.911 --> 10:06.848
to check your valve,

10:06.872 --> 10:08.038
and then we can discuss
treatment options

10:08.063 --> 10:09.113
based on your results.

10:09.138 --> 10:11.347
Will the discussion be with Scott?

10:12.029 --> 10:15.683
Um...
well, we'll have to see who's available.

10:15.708 --> 10:18.261
I need to make my amends.
Am I not going to?

10:18.286 --> 10:19.573
Let's talk about it later.

10:19.598 --> 10:21.596
Look, it's my fault
he relapsed last year.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.853
Alan, stop.

10:22.878 --> 10:24.073
I was his sponsor...

10:24.098 --> 10:25.621
Alan!

10:26.323 --> 10:28.656
Look, I was messed up myself. [Sighs]

10:28.681 --> 10:32.224
He hit that kid, and I told him
it was okay to take a drink.

10:32.249 --> 10:34.793
I-I-I need to apologize.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.360
We need a minute.

10:36.385 --> 10:38.552
Yeah. Uh, we will be right outside.

10:39.656 --> 10:41.957
- I need to talk to him.
- You can't talk to him.

10:41.982 --> 10:43.481
So much for Anonymous.

10:43.506 --> 10:45.305
Man,
that was more than I ever needed to know

10:45.330 --> 10:47.249
about my boss' personal life.

10:47.274 --> 10:48.597
Yeah.

10:48.622 --> 10:51.519
Hey, uh, do... do you think I
should ask Scott to talk to him?

10:51.746 --> 10:53.713
Alan seems really upset,
and I don't really

10:53.738 --> 10:55.183
want him to go into
surgery with unresolved...

10:55.208 --> 10:56.566
None of that 12-step crap

10:56.591 --> 10:59.225
is gonna make him any more
or less ready for surgery.

10:59.250 --> 11:00.808
Right. I mean,
studies have shown that if you, uh...

11:00.833 --> 11:02.011
I'm not talking about studies, Paul.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.368
I'm talking about personal experience,

11:03.393 --> 11:05.144
which you don't have, so leave it alone.

11:05.169 --> 11:07.503
Well, I've treated
plenty of addicts before.

11:07.528 --> 11:09.194
But you've never been one.

11:09.286 --> 11:11.409
Believe me, the last thing anyone needs

11:11.434 --> 11:14.816
is a naive 27-year-old
giving them life advice.

11:16.227 --> 11:19.763
I'm sorry, I know you're trying to help.
But it won't.

11:19.844 --> 11:21.811
[Alert tone sounds]

11:22.047 --> 11:24.247
Okay. Um...

11:24.272 --> 11:26.628
Yeah, better get back to it then.

11:27.496 --> 11:28.847
Hey, look.

11:29.129 --> 11:33.580
Look, all I'm saying is that
Paul had to wait for two months

11:33.605 --> 11:34.816
before they let him in the field.

11:34.841 --> 11:36.121
Cain's already out there with Jordan.

11:36.146 --> 11:38.847
- It's been, what, a few weeks?
- Yeah, well, Paul was an intern,

11:38.872 --> 11:41.580
and Cain was an attending
at an ER in Mexico.

11:41.605 --> 11:44.300
I bet you wish you knew
that before you hazed him.

11:44.325 --> 11:46.777
Look, he was a nurse working under me.

11:46.802 --> 11:48.302
Okay? And I didn't haze him.

11:48.327 --> 11:49.659
I told him to stop acting like a doctor.

11:49.684 --> 11:51.628
- Which he was.
- Which I didn't know.

11:51.653 --> 11:53.999
Look, all I'm saying is that the guy...

11:54.024 --> 11:55.293
Look, he just started,

11:55.318 --> 11:56.508
and he already thinks he runs the place.

11:56.533 --> 11:58.166
So you better start kissing his ass

11:58.191 --> 12:00.891
- before you are out of a job.
- [Elevator bell dings]

12:01.714 --> 12:04.867
- I ain't kissing his ass.
- [Speaks indistinctly]

12:05.388 --> 12:08.277
Hassan needs the OR.
The OR is on the base.

12:08.302 --> 12:10.254
- All we need is a ride.
- I already said no.

12:10.279 --> 12:12.535
- Let me talk to your CO.
- As far as you're concerned,

12:12.560 --> 12:13.769
I'm your final say on transport.

12:13.794 --> 12:15.402
So you're just gonna let him die?

12:16.636 --> 12:19.804
I'm sorry, Doc. It's outta my control.

12:21.269 --> 12:22.893
I'm just gonna get one of the
villagers to give us a ride.

12:22.918 --> 12:24.441
- No, you will not.
- You... Hey. Hey.

12:24.466 --> 12:26.232
It's a security risk.
You need to let this go,

12:26.257 --> 12:28.284
Callahan, because it's not gonna happen.

12:28.309 --> 12:29.605
[Crying]

12:29.630 --> 12:31.896
[Speaks Arabic, sniffles]

12:31.919 --> 12:33.322
[Shouting in Arabic]

12:33.347 --> 12:34.441
She says her son needs your help.

12:34.466 --> 12:35.527
I know what she said.

12:35.552 --> 12:37.507
Okay, he's dying, and it's all on you.

12:37.532 --> 12:40.863
[Crying] Doctors... my son...

12:40.888 --> 12:43.676
[Monitor beeping steadily]

12:45.192 --> 12:49.339
So you were saying you
never switched to a day job.

12:49.652 --> 12:51.819
No, sir.

12:51.985 --> 12:54.018
Didn't have a choice.

12:54.278 --> 12:56.378
Didn't want to lose my job.

12:56.403 --> 12:58.222
Already messed things
up with my ex-wife.

12:58.247 --> 12:59.881
Don't wanna be a deadbeat dad, too.

12:59.906 --> 13:01.674
It's hard to imagine a deadbeat dad

13:01.699 --> 13:03.041
working 17 years of night shifts.

13:03.066 --> 13:04.729
Mm. You got kids?

13:04.754 --> 13:06.567
- [Glove snaps]
- Uh, one.

13:06.592 --> 13:09.199
So you know. Do whatever
it takes, right?

13:09.224 --> 13:10.879
- [Door opens]
- Hey, Drew?

13:10.904 --> 13:12.371
- You got a minute?
- Yeah.

13:12.396 --> 13:15.196
Hey... wait, wait,
wait. Is this about me?

13:15.787 --> 13:18.755
Just don't be whispering in the corner.
I can take it.

13:20.576 --> 13:22.340
Okay.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.203
[Exhales]

13:25.228 --> 13:26.793
Lee, I'm sorry to say

13:27.008 --> 13:29.512
that with your arm in its current state,

13:29.537 --> 13:31.937
it's not a viable option for
us to reattach your hand.

13:31.962 --> 13:33.480
So that's it?

13:34.371 --> 13:35.706
It's gone?

13:35.785 --> 13:37.275
- But...
- No hand?

13:37.300 --> 13:38.957
- Well...
- Won't be able to work,

13:38.982 --> 13:41.780
put on my damn pants,
play catch with my kid.

13:42.102 --> 13:44.051
- Well...
- Y'all can't take my hand.

13:44.076 --> 13:45.856
- I need my hand.
- Listen, listen.

13:45.950 --> 13:51.066
There is one possible option,
but it is a real Hail Mary.

13:51.091 --> 13:53.948
Please. What... whatever it
takes to save it, I'll do it.

13:53.973 --> 13:55.097
I'll sign it.

13:55.122 --> 13:58.389
Okay. We can try and attach your hand

13:58.589 --> 14:01.340
to your leg while the arm heals.

14:01.645 --> 14:04.012
Wait. What?

14:04.607 --> 14:06.774
[Clears throat]

14:07.464 --> 14:08.931
Ohh.

14:08.956 --> 14:10.556
It's an innovative approach.

14:10.581 --> 14:13.379
How it works is,
the healthy blood vessels in your leg

14:13.404 --> 14:15.878
keep your hand alive
while your arm heals.

14:15.903 --> 14:18.428
And once we restore normal
blood flow to your arm,

14:18.453 --> 14:20.003
we reconnect your hand.

14:20.028 --> 14:23.238
It's out there, but it has worked.

14:23.409 --> 14:26.488
So my hand will be on my leg?

14:26.587 --> 14:27.752
Yeah.

14:27.777 --> 14:28.993
For a while.

14:29.018 --> 14:30.972
It might be your only
option of saving your hand.

14:30.997 --> 14:32.372
<i>If</i> it works.

14:32.397 --> 14:34.097
Look, I can explain a lot more to you

14:34.122 --> 14:36.300
on our way up to the OR,
but we'd have to do surgery

14:36.325 --> 14:38.125
right away while your
hand is still viable.

14:38.231 --> 14:40.761
Do it. Do it, man. I'm
all in for a chance.

14:40.786 --> 14:41.919
Okay.

14:41.944 --> 14:44.417
- [Inhales deeply]
- [Clattering]

14:44.442 --> 14:45.496
My... my stomach.

14:45.521 --> 14:47.261
[Inhales sharply, gags]

14:47.286 --> 14:51.121
- Hey...
- [Vomits]

14:51.146 --> 14:54.152
- [Gasps, grunts]
- Hey.

14:54.177 --> 14:57.311
His abdomen is diffusely tender.
Let's get him straight to C.T.

14:57.784 --> 15:00.418
Drew, we gotta get this
abdominal issue resolved now.

15:00.443 --> 15:01.968
If he's not cleared for
surgery in the next hour...

15:01.993 --> 15:03.722
He loses any chance of keeping his hand.
I'm on it.

15:07.566 --> 15:08.925
[Siren wailing]

15:08.950 --> 15:11.551
[Thud, tires screech]

15:15.835 --> 15:18.002
[Monitor beeping rapidly] We got you.

15:18.027 --> 15:19.378
Are you okay?

15:19.403 --> 15:21.721
[Monitor continues beeping rapidly]

15:21.746 --> 15:23.641
- You guys okay?
- Yeah. You?

15:23.666 --> 15:26.877
I'm all right. I blew a tire.
I gotta call in another rig.

15:26.902 --> 15:28.401
Hey, what's the ETA?

15:28.426 --> 15:29.839
15 to 20.

15:29.864 --> 15:31.858
He's never gonna make it.
He's got a cardiac tamponade.

15:31.883 --> 15:34.033
Okay, we do this now. You ready, Boss?

15:34.058 --> 15:35.992
- Yeah. Okay.
- On you.

15:36.016 --> 15:37.511
All right. On three.

15:37.536 --> 15:40.268
One, two, three.

15:40.293 --> 15:43.026
[Squish]

15:43.051 --> 15:44.938
I'll intubate. You can open him up.

15:44.963 --> 15:48.765
[Monitor beeping erratically]

15:48.790 --> 15:49.839
Here.

15:49.864 --> 15:52.732
[Erratic beeping continues]

15:55.627 --> 15:57.902
Your tests came back negative
for coronary artery disease,

15:57.927 --> 15:59.916
but you have a large aortic aneurysm

15:59.941 --> 16:01.268
that's causing your chest pain.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.793
What does that mean?

16:02.927 --> 16:04.793
We need to operate immediately.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.589
We're gonna admit you to the hospital

16:06.614 --> 16:08.414
and get you optimized for surgery.

16:08.439 --> 16:09.838
Who's doing the surgery?

16:09.910 --> 16:11.651
Dr. Gordon, the day shift surgeon.

16:11.676 --> 16:13.276
He's on his way right now.

16:13.332 --> 16:15.604
You've got the best
cardiothoracic surgeon

16:15.629 --> 16:17.395
in the county in Scott,

16:17.420 --> 16:18.919
and you're bringing in Dr. Garden?

16:18.944 --> 16:20.846
Uh, D-Dr. Gordon, actually.

16:20.871 --> 16:23.339
Yeah, that is not happening.

16:24.956 --> 16:26.443
[Knocks on door]

16:26.468 --> 16:28.235
Hey, bud. How's he doing?

16:28.369 --> 16:30.628
He's about to lose his hand.
How do you think he's doing?

16:30.653 --> 16:31.839
[Door closes]

16:31.864 --> 16:33.557
Sorry, man. I was just
checking in on you.

16:33.582 --> 16:35.995
- [Door opens]
- Sorry. I'm frustrated.

16:37.809 --> 16:39.643
I can't figure it out.

16:39.668 --> 16:42.676
He's got stomach pains one minute,
he's got none the next.

16:42.715 --> 16:44.355
I've eliminated a ton of things,

16:44.380 --> 16:46.065
but I still can't find
out what's causing it.

16:46.090 --> 16:47.472
Scott's waiting on
the C.T. and the labs.

16:47.497 --> 16:48.996
Maybe he can figure it out.

16:49.021 --> 16:51.021
How long before Lee's
hand is no longer viable?

16:51.046 --> 16:52.646
35 minutes.

16:54.154 --> 16:55.419
[Huffs]

16:55.444 --> 16:56.877
[Clatter]

16:57.067 --> 17:00.759
This guy...
there but by the Grace of God go I.

17:01.064 --> 17:02.689
What do you mean?

17:03.389 --> 17:05.021
He's like everybody I grew up with.

17:05.087 --> 17:07.016
He's hard-working, he's blue collar,

17:07.040 --> 17:08.914
busts his ass trying to provide.

17:08.939 --> 17:12.548
And he finds himself on the
verge of 40 with nothing.

17:12.810 --> 17:15.392
