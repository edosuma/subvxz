00:00.001 --> 00:03.335
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ah, there you are again.</i>
<i>Before we begin, a refresher:</i>

00:08.475 --> 00:10.109
<i>Jane's grandmother</i>
<i>raised her to believe</i>

00:10.111 --> 00:12.678
<i>That her virginity was sacred,</i>
<i>that she should wait.</i>

00:12.680 --> 00:14.179
This is jane's fiancÃ©, michael.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.115
<i>Their life was perfectly</i>
<i>on track until...</i>

00:16.117 --> 00:17.116
There you are, doctor.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.317
<i>You have an insemination</i>

00:18.319 --> 00:19.551
<i>In seven and a pap in eight.</i>

00:19.553 --> 00:20.619
Luisa:
<i>Yeah, an insemination</i>

00:20.621 --> 00:21.687
<i>And a pap, yeah, I got it.</i>

00:21.689 --> 00:25.224
Latin lover narrator:
<i>She does not "got it."</i>

00:25.226 --> 00:26.125
Are you ready
for your insemination?

00:26.127 --> 00:28.127
Hi. Yes.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.195
I artificially inseminated
the wrong woman.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.130
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And the father, rafael,</i>

00:31.132 --> 00:32.631
<i>Is married to petra.</i>

00:32.633 --> 00:35.200
<i>Unfortunately, petra was</i>
<i>boning his best friend.</i>

00:35.202 --> 00:37.636
<i>And michael knows this,</i>
<i>because he's a detective.</i>

00:37.638 --> 00:39.171
<i>But that problem kind of</i>
<i>took care of itself.</i>

00:39.173 --> 00:40.639
<i>Yep, that happened.</i>

00:40.641 --> 00:42.174
<i>Roman zazo died.</i>

00:42.176 --> 00:44.343
<i>Meanwhile...</i>
<i>This is jane's father,</i>

00:44.345 --> 00:47.246
<i>International telenovela star</i>

00:47.248 --> 00:48.714
<i>Rogelio de la vega,</i>

00:48.716 --> 00:51.050
<i>Who her mother is currently</i>
<i>hooking up with.</i>

00:51.052 --> 00:53.185
<i>But jane doesn't know</i>
<i>he's her father... Yet.</i>

00:53.187 --> 00:55.087
<i>And now you are caught up.</i>

00:55.089 --> 00:56.588
â™ª

00:56.590 --> 00:58.223
<i>On the 27th of October,</i>

00:58.225 --> 01:00.659
Way, way back in the year 2000,

01:00.661 --> 01:02.795
Young jane gloriana villanueva

01:02.797 --> 01:06.398
<i>Caught a firefly in her hands.</i>

01:06.400 --> 01:10.369
<i>And so she made</i>
<i>a very important wish.</i>

01:12.238 --> 01:14.706
<i>Actually, two.</i>

01:16.176 --> 01:17.643
<i>And when she was 16,</i>

01:17.645 --> 01:19.278
<i>Both of those wishes</i>

01:19.280 --> 01:21.480
<i>Were finally coming true.</i>

01:21.482 --> 01:23.282
<i>That is, until...</i>

01:23.284 --> 01:24.683
Jane:
Just so you know,

01:24.685 --> 01:26.351
I'm gonna save myself.

01:26.353 --> 01:27.486
Until marriage.

01:29.689 --> 01:32.791
(lyrical song playing)
I can't believe
he dumped me.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.626
Maybe next time...
Just don't tell him

01:34.628 --> 01:36.428
About the whole
virgin-until-marriage-thing.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.663
Xiomara!

01:37.665 --> 01:39.131
Relax.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.299
I don't mean
"have sex."

01:40.301 --> 01:42.701
I just mean put off
the conversation,

01:42.703 --> 01:44.369
Let him think you
like to take it slow.

01:53.213 --> 01:55.347
Really, ma?
"big balls of evil"?

01:59.219 --> 02:02.354
But how will I know when
I've met the right man?

02:07.227 --> 02:09.695
And that little tingly
feeling between your legs.

02:09.697 --> 02:12.164
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And so, that night,</i>

02:12.166 --> 02:14.133
<i>As xo's favorite</i>
<i>breakup song played,</i>

02:14.135 --> 02:16.535
<i>Jane made a final wish.</i>

02:16.537 --> 02:18.403
<i>That she'd meet</i>
<i>the perfect guy,</i>

02:18.405 --> 02:20.239
<i>The one who would wait,</i>

02:20.241 --> 02:22.307
<i>And she'd know-- deep inside--</i>

02:22.309 --> 02:23.442
<i>It was right.</i>

02:24.377 --> 02:25.711
(knocking at door)

02:25.713 --> 02:26.879
Jane:
Ma!
Shh, shh, shh.

02:26.881 --> 02:28.280
Mom, I need my wedges.

02:28.282 --> 02:29.448
Which I told you
not to borrow.

02:29.450 --> 02:30.883
Hang on, honey, one minute!

02:30.885 --> 02:32.417
This is a great moment.
Let's tell her

02:32.419 --> 02:33.785
That I'm her father right now.
Shh, shh.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.387
Why are you
up, honey?

02:35.389 --> 02:37.189
It's only 6:00.

02:37.191 --> 02:38.290
You're not on
breakfast on mondays.
Yeah.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.558
I switched with frankie
so that I could

02:39.560 --> 02:40.893
Have coffee with petra later.

02:40.895 --> 02:42.394
I want to get
to know her a little.

02:44.430 --> 02:45.664
Mama!
I need my shoes!

02:45.666 --> 02:47.266
Come on!

02:47.268 --> 02:49.334
Why is this even locked?

02:49.336 --> 02:50.769
No reason, honey.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.571
Here you go.
Thanks. Ma?

02:52.573 --> 02:53.906
Is everything okay?

02:53.908 --> 02:55.240
Alba:
Jane!

03:00.346 --> 03:02.214
Now?
Mm-hmm.

03:02.216 --> 03:03.715
Rogelio:
My daughter is getting married?

03:03.717 --> 03:05.384
No, wait, I'm on
tour in the fall.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.452
We'll need her to work
around some dates...

03:12.225 --> 03:13.525
Psst.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.594
Ooh...

03:15.596 --> 03:17.362
Yeah, I think...

03:17.364 --> 03:19.331
I think these arepas
are plenty spicy.

03:22.435 --> 03:24.503
Mm-mm. I have to go
to work now...

03:28.374 --> 03:29.875
Abuela?
Huh?

03:29.877 --> 03:31.376
Are you okay?

03:36.616 --> 03:39.751
Then again, we both ended up
unmarried and pregnant, so

03:39.753 --> 03:41.520
You must have really pissed
the big man off.

03:41.522 --> 03:42.454
(gasps)

03:42.456 --> 03:43.855
I'm sorry, honey,

03:43.857 --> 03:45.424
I didn't mean it
as an insult to you,

03:45.426 --> 03:47.459
Just as an insult to her.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.695
Latin lover narrator:
<i>But jane wasn't</i>
<i>insulted at all.</i>

03:49.697 --> 03:52.531
<i>In fact, she'd just had</i>
<i>an epiphany.</i>

03:52.533 --> 03:54.466
My whole life,
I didn't want to end up

03:54.468 --> 03:56.235
An unmarried pregnant woman
like my mom.

03:56.237 --> 03:57.536
But guess what.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.571
I'm an unmarried pregnant woman
like my mom.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.541
The big bad thing, the thing
I was most afraid of...

04:02.543 --> 04:04.343
It happened.

04:04.345 --> 04:07.946
But I'm engaged
to the man that I love

04:07.948 --> 04:09.848
And I'm going to spend
the rest of my life with.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.618
I waited for you.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.519
And now that I'm pregnant,

04:14.521 --> 04:16.388
Why should I wait another year,

04:16.390 --> 04:18.624
Another week,
another minute, even?

04:18.626 --> 04:21.360
Jane... What are you saying?

04:21.362 --> 04:23.495
Let's have sex.

04:23.497 --> 04:26.331
(angelic choir singing)

04:26.333 --> 04:28.500
Oh...

04:37.510 --> 04:39.344
Are you nervous?

04:39.346 --> 04:40.379
Don't be nervous.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.447
That's easy for you to say.

04:42.449 --> 04:43.982
It'll be quick,
I promise.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.417
In and out.

04:45.419 --> 04:46.918
Will you come with me?

04:46.920 --> 04:48.887
That's not really
appropriate.

04:48.889 --> 04:51.556
Just tell them everything
you saw, okay?

04:51.558 --> 04:53.058
Last night, before
roman zazo fell.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.426
You never know
what's important

04:54.428 --> 04:55.894
At the beginning
of an investigation.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.663
No detail's
too small.

04:57.665 --> 04:58.997
We're looking for the
tiniest inconsistencies.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.432
What?

05:00.434 --> 05:01.967
Nothing.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.735
I just... Find it kind of sexy

05:03.737 --> 05:05.504
When you talk all... Cop.

05:05.506 --> 05:06.905
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.740
I've got a 15-minute
break coming up.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.742
The seats in my car lean
all the way back...

05:10.744 --> 05:12.411
I'm not having sex
with you for the first time

05:12.413 --> 05:13.645
In the backseat of your car.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.514
I was totally
kidding.
Mm-hmm.

05:15.516 --> 05:16.948
Female officer:
Jane? Your turn.

05:16.950 --> 05:19.451
You ready?
Mm-hmm.

05:19.453 --> 05:20.752
Okay.

05:24.624 --> 05:25.857
Honey, stop reading

05:25.859 --> 05:27.326
Those articles.

05:27.328 --> 05:28.560
They're just speculating

05:28.562 --> 05:29.628
And you're torturing
yourself.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.396
I know. I know.

05:31.398 --> 05:33.765
Did you know that my dad
wants me to cancel the memorial

05:33.767 --> 05:36.601
And issue a statement
distancing the hotel from zaz?

05:36.603 --> 05:37.836
Well, are you going to do it?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.004
What choice
do I have?

05:39.006 --> 05:40.772
He's the majority owner.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.507
Whatever.
I gotta find zaz's brother

05:42.509 --> 05:45.043
And tell him what happened.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.546
Yeah?
I don't even know
where to find him, though,

05:47.548 --> 05:48.814
'cause zaz hadn't talked
to the guy in ten years.

05:48.816 --> 05:51.483
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Trust me,</i>

05:51.485 --> 05:52.718
<i>She definitely knew.</i>

05:52.720 --> 05:54.519
But I really didn't know zaz.

05:54.521 --> 05:55.554
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Trust me,</i>

05:55.556 --> 05:56.955
<i>She definitely did.</i>

05:56.957 --> 05:59.591
â™ª

06:01.627 --> 06:03.395
My necklace...

06:05.498 --> 06:07.099
I, uh...

06:07.101 --> 06:09.468
I had a-a necklace

06:09.470 --> 06:11.036
I wanted to wear tonight.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.472
I'm sorry.

06:13.474 --> 06:15.907
I think I'm just focusing
on these silly, mundane things

06:15.909 --> 06:18.510
Because I'm just...

06:18.512 --> 06:19.644
(sighs)

06:19.646 --> 06:21.513
I'm just in shock.

06:21.515 --> 06:23.515
Latin lover narrator:
<i>This was absolutely true.</i>

06:23.517 --> 06:25.083
<i>Petra was in shock.</i>

06:25.085 --> 06:28.120
<i>And she knew exactly</i>
<i>what she needed to do.</i>

06:31.791 --> 06:33.058
Nadine:
We interviewed the employees,

06:33.060 --> 06:34.593
And nobody saw anything
suspicious.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.428
It was clearly
a crime of passion.

06:36.430 --> 06:39.131
Which is why we need to bring
petra solano in for questioning.

06:39.133 --> 06:41.099
No way. No. No.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.835
Roman zazo was an associate
of sin rostro...

06:43.837 --> 06:46.671
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Think of sin rostro as</i>
<i>"the big bad wolf."</i>

06:46.673 --> 06:48.607
We're the closest we've been
to this guy in four years.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.175
If we bring
petra in now,

06:50.177 --> 06:51.643
Her lawyer's gonna
start asking questions,

06:51.645 --> 06:52.911
It's gonna expose the
whole investigation.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.679
No signs of
struggle.

06:54.681 --> 06:56.148
It was someone
he knew.

06:56.150 --> 06:57.916
Sir, she's not strong enough

06:57.918 --> 06:59.518
To push him through a window.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.852
What-what about
the unregistered gun?

07:00.854 --> 07:02.754
What...? It wasn't used,
it wasn't even out.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.556
And whoever it was
was having drinks with him.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.992
Two glasses
were found...
One without fingerprints.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.528
Because petra wiped
it down...
Why would she
wipe down a glass

07:09.530 --> 07:10.662
When she knows her prints
are all over that apartment?

07:10.664 --> 07:12.731
So, her husband found out
and he did it.

07:12.733 --> 07:13.999
We have no
evidence he knew.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.934
Which is why we need
to bring her in

07:15.936 --> 07:17.969
And ask some questions...
All right, enough.
I need to think.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.438
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Fyi...</i>

07:19.440 --> 07:20.472
<i>Everything michael said?</i>

07:20.474 --> 07:22.441
<i>Absolutely true.</i>

07:22.443 --> 07:24.676
<i>And yet he is absolutely lying</i>
<i>about the real reason</i>

07:24.678 --> 07:26.778
<i>He needed to keep</i>
<i>petra's affair under wraps.</i>

07:26.780 --> 07:29.681
<i>See, he had made</i>
<i>some calculations...</i>

07:32.685 --> 07:34.653
<i>...Which would leave him...</i>

07:39.125 --> 07:40.659
If sin rostro
took out zaz

07:40.661 --> 07:41.760
And he doesn't know
we're onto him...

07:41.762 --> 07:42.961
Well, we've got a real shot

07:42.963 --> 07:44.162
At the big bad wolf.

07:44.164 --> 07:46.031
But one piece
of evidence

07:46.033 --> 07:47.098
Comes to light
against petra,

07:47.100 --> 07:49.034
We're bringing her in.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.669
(phone chimes)

08:01.047 --> 08:03.615
(elevator dings)

08:15.228 --> 08:17.128
Hey.
Hi.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.231
Did you know the guy?
Who, uh...

08:19.233 --> 08:21.099
Roman zazo.

08:21.101 --> 08:24.069
Yeah.

08:24.071 --> 08:26.271
He was,
he was my, um...

08:26.273 --> 08:28.273
College roommate.

08:28.275 --> 08:31.209
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And maybe it was</i>
<i>the look in his eyes,</i>

08:31.211 --> 08:35.780
<i>But jane felt compelled</i>
<i>to touch rafael's arm.</i>

08:38.050 --> 08:40.652
(heart pounding quickly)

08:45.224 --> 08:47.659
Anyway...

08:47.661 --> 08:49.261
If you need anything,
I'm around.

08:49.263 --> 08:51.229
Lina:
<i>You little liar!</i>

08:51.231 --> 08:53.298
You never told me
you were going to have sex!

08:53.300 --> 08:55.066
Michael seems
like a crier.

08:55.068 --> 08:56.768
What? No.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.203
He's not a crier.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.971
Oh, please, he's so
totally in love with you,

08:59.973 --> 09:01.306
It's all been pent up.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.208
There's a good chance
he cries on release.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.076
Where are you
going, his place?

09:05.078 --> 09:06.745
No, michael's brother--

09:06.747 --> 09:09.080
Who he cannot stand--
is crashing there.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.916
My first time was
in a tanning bed.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.317
Ew.
Ew.
Ew.

09:12.319 --> 09:14.219
She does not want
a tanning bed.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.254
She's gonna want it all
fairy tale telenovela.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.856
That is not true.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.758
I just want it somewhere
between fairy tale telenovela

09:19.760 --> 09:21.259
And the backseat of a car.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.295
You should take one of
those 11th-floor suites.

09:23.297 --> 09:24.729
The cops closed the whole floor.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.031
Luca:
Those are nice.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.033
So, are you nervous?

09:28.035 --> 09:30.068
Nervous? No.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.237
Yes.
Yeah, maybe a little bit.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.305
Mm-hmm.
Well, it's just...

09:33.307 --> 09:34.839
It's such a big deal.

09:34.841 --> 09:36.341
And I want it to be good.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.276
You know? For me.
For him...

09:38.278 --> 09:40.278
Yeah, I changed
my mind.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.247
You're both
gonna cry.
(laughs)

09:42.249 --> 09:43.848
I'll take table eight.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.885
Hey, guys.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.320
Can I get you
something to drink?

09:48.322 --> 09:50.855
Oh, hi.

09:53.793 --> 09:55.594
Rose, dad...

09:55.596 --> 09:57.028
This is jane.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.264
The girl I accidentally
impregnated who's suing me.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.799
Hello.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.734
Can we get

10:02.736 --> 10:04.102
Three waters, please?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.937
Maybe I should get someone else.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.639
Great idea.
Good idea, yeah.
Great idea.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.276
Well, that is one way to meet

10:11.278 --> 10:12.811
The mother of
your grandchild.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.279
I'm going to leave you both.

10:14.281 --> 10:17.949
Thanks for helping my daughter
with her legal woes.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.084
Luisa
can be

10:19.086 --> 10:20.986
A bit of a handful.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.993
What are you doing?

10:27.995 --> 10:29.628
Leave him.
What?

10:29.630 --> 10:31.329
Let's go somewhere.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.397
Together.

10:32.399 --> 10:33.898
You don't love him.

10:34.967 --> 10:38.103
What happened yesterday
was a mistake.

10:38.105 --> 10:40.338
It's not gonna happen again.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.644
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Meanwhile, jane was</i>
<i>trying to put luisa</i>

10:45.646 --> 10:46.678
<i>Far from her mind.</i>

10:46.680 --> 10:47.779
<i>Armed with a key</i>

10:47.781 --> 10:49.280
<i>To the 11th floor suites,</i>

10:49.282 --> 10:51.650
<i>She concentrated</i>
<i>on what lay ahead.</i>

10:51.652 --> 10:54.319
<i>Specifically</i>
<i>getting laid ahead.</i>

10:54.321 --> 10:55.787
<i>Because the truth is</i>

10:55.789 --> 10:58.289
<i>Jane did want</i>
<i>the perfect fairy tale</i>

10:58.291 --> 11:00.291
<i>Telenovela experience</i>
<i>for her first time.</i>

11:00.293 --> 11:04.262
<i>Then again,</i>
<i>perfect doesn't exist.</i>

11:04.264 --> 11:07.065
<i>Especially in telenovelas.</i>

11:07.067 --> 11:09.968
<i>Suddenly, jane saw petra</i>
<i>lurking at the crime scene.</i>

11:16.442 --> 11:18.677
<i>Petra popping pills.</i>

11:18.679 --> 11:20.679
<i>And then...</i>

11:20.681 --> 11:23.014
<i>Her fiancÃ©.</i>

11:23.016 --> 11:25.116
What took you so long?

11:25.118 --> 11:26.851
We're not talking here.

11:37.263 --> 11:39.731
Latin lover narrator:
<i>You will recall we last left</i>
<i>jane witnessing something</i>

11:39.733 --> 11:41.399
<i>That left her</i>
<i>more than mildly unsettled.</i>

11:53.379 --> 11:55.480
You don't go to the crime scene.
You didn't answer my text.

11:55.482 --> 11:56.981
I was with my boss,
trying to keep you out of jail.

11:56.983 --> 11:58.883
They're looking
for any reason to bring you in.

12:00.986 --> 12:04.222
I left the necklace in there.
What?!

12:04.224 --> 12:06.157
When I went to end it,
things got a little...

12:06.159 --> 12:08.426
Violent.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.928
You have to go get it.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.863
Please?

12:11.865 --> 12:13.998
Where were you last night
when zaz was killed?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.100
What?

12:15.102 --> 12:16.167
You heard me.
Where were you?

12:16.169 --> 12:19.070
I was in our suite.

12:20.039 --> 12:21.272
Look, I'm guilty
of having an affair.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.308
That's all!

12:23.310 --> 12:24.409
I love my husband.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.945
If he finds out, he'll leave me.

12:29.882 --> 12:31.382
Jane? Hello.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.484
Hi. Hey.

12:32.486 --> 12:33.785
What are you guys up to?

12:33.787 --> 12:35.053
Are you okay, honey?
Mm-hmm.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.387
I was just talking
to your fiancÃ©

12:36.389 --> 12:37.822
About hotel security.
You know,

12:37.824 --> 12:39.290
After what happened.
Of course.

12:39.292 --> 12:40.825
Thank you. Uh, we're
still on for coffee later,

12:40.827 --> 12:42.060
I hope.
Yeah, yeah. Looking
forward to it.

12:42.062 --> 12:44.496
Great, good.
Uh-huh.

12:45.464 --> 12:48.800
So, what was that all about?
What?

12:48.802 --> 12:50.435
Well, I was upstairs, trying
to get us a room for tonight.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.803
And...
You got us a room?

12:51.805 --> 12:53.238
Yes, but listen.
I saw petra

12:53.240 --> 12:55.106
Outside the crime scene
and then I saw you

12:55.108 --> 12:56.808
Meet her up there.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.810
So, what were you guys
really talking about?

12:58.812 --> 13:00.478
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Part of michael wanted</i>
<i>to tell jane</i>

13:00.480 --> 13:02.247
<i>Everything</i>
<i>right then and there,</i>

13:02.249 --> 13:04.015
<i>Not go any deeper,</i>
<i>not let this thing snowball...</i>

13:04.017 --> 13:05.517
We were talking
about hotel security.

13:05.519 --> 13:06.818
That's it.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.520
<i>...But instead he lied.</i>

13:08.522 --> 13:10.155
Well, I think that you
need to talk to her again

13:10.157 --> 13:11.489
Because I saw her lurking
outside the crime scene

13:11.491 --> 13:12.857
Before you got there.

13:12.859 --> 13:14.859
"lurking"?
Okay, you officially

13:14.861 --> 13:16.494
Watch too many telenovelas.

13:16.496 --> 13:19.497
Michael, I'm saying "lurking"
because she was lurking.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.166
She's standing there
in front of the door.

13:21.168 --> 13:22.267
She wanted to go in.

13:22.269 --> 13:23.268
She changed her mind.

13:23.270 --> 13:24.269
She started to shake.

13:24.271 --> 13:25.336
And then she took a pill!

13:25.338 --> 13:26.504
Trust me.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.339
Something is off!

13:28.341 --> 13:30.175
Her friend was killed.
She's upset.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.343
What's going on with you?

13:32.345 --> 13:34.112
Nothing.
Then why are you dismissing me?

13:34.114 --> 13:35.580
I'm dismissing you 'cause
you're not making any sense.

13:35.582 --> 13:36.981
You're, like,
hormonal or something.

13:39.018 --> 13:40.351
I-I...
Mm-hmm.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.586
Jane?

13:41.588 --> 13:43.855
(sighs)

13:52.198 --> 13:53.932
Mm.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.533
Hi.

13:55.535 --> 13:56.568
Hi.

13:56.570 --> 13:57.936
Are you done with work?

13:57.938 --> 14:00.538
No. No, I had a break.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.508
I had this really strong urge...

14:03.510 --> 14:04.609
Actually "urge" is
not the right word.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.144
I had a need.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.613
I needed a <i>croquetta.</i>

14:08.615 --> 14:12.517
I guess it's a pregnancy
craving or something.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.886
I would offer you some,

14:14.888 --> 14:16.621
But I'm really enjoying it
and if I give you a bite,

14:16.623 --> 14:18.489
I may resent you in
a very serious way.

14:18.491 --> 14:19.891
Okay.
(quiet laugh)

14:21.560 --> 14:22.894
So...

14:22.896 --> 14:24.295
Petra?

14:24.297 --> 14:25.630
How is she doing?

14:25.632 --> 14:28.399
Uh, it must be
really hard for her.

14:28.401 --> 14:31.903
Actually, she's been...
Really strong.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.404
Good. I'm so glad.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.874
Because if she was struggling,
I would understand.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.175
No, yeah, no. I...

14:37.177 --> 14:38.309
You'd think she would be.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.644
But she's, she's...

14:39.646 --> 14:41.412
Been incredible.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.348
(seagull caws)

14:43.350 --> 14:44.949
So, how are you?

14:44.951 --> 14:46.317
Uh...

14:46.319 --> 14:48.219
Is that, is that weird?

14:48.221 --> 14:50.355
I mean, am I allowed
to ask you that?

14:50.357 --> 14:51.923
I think it's all weird,
don't you think?

14:51.925 --> 14:53.391
Yeah.
Yeah.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.393
But, yeah.

14:55.395 --> 14:58.329
I'm adjusting.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.565
What's that?

15:00.567 --> 15:03.434
Oh, it's a... Press release.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.169
Wait, you're a writer.

15:05.171 --> 15:06.938
Can you help me with this?
You're the only one

15:06.940 --> 15:08.673
That calls me a writer.
Do you know that?

15:08.675 --> 15:11.009
Well, are you writing?

15:11.011 --> 15:13.945
Good. So...

15:13.947 --> 15:16.514
I have to issue a statement
about what happened last night.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.516
And I don't know, maybe...

15:18.518 --> 15:20.952
Is there a way to allude
to the same thing

15:20.954 --> 15:23.354
But make it seem
a little, uh...

15:23.356 --> 15:25.256
Nicer?

15:25.258 --> 15:26.524
Uh...

15:26.526 --> 15:28.192
Say "that your
college roommate

15:28.194 --> 15:30.962
"was a troubled young man
who you and the hotel

15:30.964 --> 15:33.498
Have nothing to
do with" nicer?

15:33.500 --> 15:37.435
My dad's trying to protect
the hotel's reputation.

15:40.139 --> 15:41.673
What?

15:41.675 --> 15:43.374
Nothing.

15:44.476 --> 15:46.010
(sighs)
I'm sorry.

15:46.012 --> 15:47.211
I'm judgey.

15:47.213 --> 15:48.646
You should know that about me.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.148
You may end up having
a really judgey kid.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.050
Okay, so what does
"judgey" sound like?

15:52.052 --> 15:53.618
So that I can be prepared.

15:57.556 --> 15:59.624
You told me that you don't want
to be anything like your dad,

15:59.626 --> 16:01.292
Which is easy enough to say.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.027
But actions are what count.

16:03.029 --> 16:04.462
So, what are you doing about it?

16:09.735 --> 16:12.570
I hope the baby's judgey.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.706
Latin lover narrator:
<i>But it happened again.</i>

16:14.708 --> 16:17.542
<i>That quickening</i>
<i>in jane's heart.</i>

16:17.544 --> 16:19.744
<i>Or maybe it was just</i>
<i>the pregnancy hormones</i>

16:19.746 --> 16:21.746
<i>And not her heart at all.</i>

16:21.748 --> 16:23.114
I should get back to work.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.416
Uh, good to see you.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.685
Uh, uh, okay.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.754
(doorbell rings)

16:36.662 --> 16:38.997
Hi.

16:40.632 --> 16:43.634
Some kind of gift
from rogelio, it looks like.

16:47.139 --> 16:49.741
I'm telling you, ma, it was
like electric between us!

16:52.311 --> 16:53.678
Oh.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.146
His headshot.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.348
Well, that's nice to have.

17:00.719 --> 17:04.222
His signature
super spicy salad dressing.

17:05.657 --> 17:07.792
It's some kind of
prepackaged gift.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.494
<i>Bueno...</i>

17:09.496 --> 17:11.729
Whatever.
He's a jerk.

17:24.109 --> 17:26.044
I know, ma.
And I was going to.

17:26.046 --> 17:27.545
But with the pregnancy,

17:27.547 --> 17:28.813
I just don't want
to overwhelm her right now.

17:32.818 --> 17:34.185
Ma, relax.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.821
He agreed to stay away from her.

17:36.823 --> 17:38.623
Hi. I would like your biggest,

17:38.625 --> 17:40.792
Most grandest room, please.

17:53.372 --> 17:55.139
I couldn't ask rafael.
He just kept going on and on

17:55.141 --> 17:56.841
About how great his marriage is.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.676
Rogelio de la vega.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.078
De la vega.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.245
Rogelio de la vega.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.547
Maybe I am hormonal.

18:02.549 --> 18:05.716
Maybe she took that pill
because she had a headache.

18:05.718 --> 18:08.419
Yeah, and maybe you picked
a fight with michael

18:08.421 --> 18:10.154
Because you're still
afraid to have sex.

18:10.156 --> 18:12.090
First of all,
I'm not afraid to have sex.

18:12.092 --> 18:13.424
I've never been
afraid to have sex!

18:13.426 --> 18:15.626
And I didn't pick
a fight with him.

18:15.628 --> 18:16.727
There was something
off with petra.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.229
My gut is telling me.

18:18.231 --> 18:20.565
Oh, sure.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.166
Who should I make it out to?

18:23.469 --> 18:26.270
Oh, it's the, oh, it's...
Oh. Yes.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.706
Maybe she's got a pill problem
and zaz was her dealer.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.708
He was doing something bad.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.577
I heard they found
a gun in his room.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.245
What? Are you serious?

18:34.247 --> 18:35.646
Carmen from dry
cleaning saw the cops

18:35.648 --> 18:37.181
Carrying it out of the room

18:37.183 --> 18:38.683
In one of those
little baggies.

18:38.685 --> 18:41.752
What if petra has
a real drug problem?

18:43.188 --> 18:44.689
Okay, here's what you do.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.524
You need to find a way
to get petra's urine

18:46.526 --> 18:47.725
So you can test it.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.594
Okay, really?
That's your solution?

18:49.596 --> 18:51.629
Desperate times,
desperate measures.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.198
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Desperate times,</i>
<i>desperate measures indeed.</i>

18:55.367 --> 18:56.701
<i>Which is why</i>

18:56.703 --> 18:57.635
<i>Michael was about to commit</i>

18:57.637 --> 18:59.537
<i>A federal offense.</i>

19:02.174 --> 19:04.208
Rafael:
Michael?

19:04.210 --> 19:06.444
Hi. Rafael?

19:08.647 --> 19:10.715
The father of the...
Yes, I know.

19:10.717 --> 19:12.183
Right. Hi.

19:13.452 --> 19:15.520
Look, uh, you
shouldn't be here.

19:15.522 --> 19:16.821
This is an active crime scene.
Don't want anyone

19:16.823 --> 19:18.623
Tampering with the evidence.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.725
Okay. Well, I'd like to speak

19:20.727 --> 19:22.426
With the lead detective then.

19:22.428 --> 19:23.694
That would be me.
How can I help you?

19:23.696 --> 19:25.363
(quiet laugh)

19:25.365 --> 19:26.631
Why don't we start
with you telling me

19:26.633 --> 19:28.232
What you think happened here.

19:28.234 --> 19:29.667
I'm sorry. I can't
discuss the details

19:29.669 --> 19:31.302
Of an open investigation.
The press is all over this!

19:31.304 --> 19:32.370
I got to tell them something.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.437
The press is not my problem.

19:33.439 --> 19:34.472
Well, I have a right to know

19:34.474 --> 19:35.740
What's happening in my hotel!

19:35.742 --> 19:38.509
My crime scene
trumps your hotel.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.748
Don't take it personally.

19:43.750 --> 19:44.882
He's frustrated.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.784
We don't have a lot
of information yet.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.886
But, uh, between us?

19:48.888 --> 19:51.822
We are working on
a few different theories.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.424
Accident, murder.

19:53.426 --> 19:54.759
Maybe crime of passion?

19:54.761 --> 19:58.329
Did you know his girlfriend?

19:58.331 --> 20:00.898
(chuckles)
zaz didn't have a girlfriend.

20:01.733 --> 20:03.534
That you know of.

20:09.975 --> 20:11.809
Thank you for covering for me.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.411
I'll be right back.
You got it.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.512
Excuse me, miss?

20:14.514 --> 20:15.880
Mm-hmm.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.685
(quietly):
Oh, my god.

20:20.687 --> 20:21.953
I know.

20:21.955 --> 20:24.422
(laughing):
Oh, my god!

20:24.424 --> 20:26.791
It is indeed me.

20:26.793 --> 20:27.992
(short breaths)

20:27.994 --> 20:29.527
No, no, no, please, please.

20:29.529 --> 20:30.795
Breathe, just, you know...

20:30.797 --> 20:31.829
<i>Inhala.</i>

20:31.831 --> 20:32.897
<i>Exhala.</i>

20:32.899 --> 20:34.465
<i>Inhala.</i>

20:34.467 --> 20:36.267
<i>Exhala.</i>

20:36.269 --> 20:37.468
It-it happens all the time.

20:37.470 --> 20:38.903
It is very hard
for normal people

20:38.905 --> 20:41.272
Like you...

20:41.274 --> 20:43.441
To believe it
when they see me in person.

20:43.443 --> 20:44.709
Oh!

20:44.711 --> 20:46.277
You know what?

20:46.279 --> 20:47.812
This is really embarrassing,
but I am gonna

20:47.814 --> 20:49.280
Hate myself after
if I don't ask you.

20:50.782 --> 20:52.783
Can I get a selfie?

20:52.785 --> 20:55.386
Oh, yes.
I will love that very much.

20:55.388 --> 20:56.988
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Even though rogelio</i>
<i>knew he could</i>

20:56.990 --> 20:58.923
<i>Get in trouble with xiomara,</i>
<i>he could not resist</i>

20:58.925 --> 21:00.791
<i>Taking a picture</i>
<i>with his daughter.</i>

21:00.793 --> 21:02.827
Silly phone. Okay.

21:02.829 --> 21:04.528
Oh, I was just...
It's not on.

21:04.530 --> 21:06.831
Okay.

21:08.867 --> 21:10.501
Xiomara (gasps):
Look.

21:11.903 --> 21:13.004
Okay. Okay.

21:13.006 --> 21:14.605
He-he couldn't
have told her.

21:14.607 --> 21:15.806
She wouldn't have
snapped a selfie.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.810
Wait. Stop.
To say what exactly?

21:26.852 --> 21:29.387
(doorbell rings)

21:30.889 --> 21:32.890
Jane:
Hello?

21:32.892 --> 21:35.393
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Please note, this was not</i>

21:35.395 --> 21:37.028
<i>The sort of thing</i>
<i>jane usually did.</i>

21:37.030 --> 21:39.297
Anybody home?
<i>And in the event</i>

21:39.299 --> 21:42.967
<i>Someone answered, she had</i>
<i>an excuse clearly planned out.</i>

21:47.873 --> 21:49.940
Hello?

21:49.942 --> 21:52.710
Latin lover narrator:
<i>But no one did answer.</i>

21:56.782 --> 21:58.649
Huh.

22:09.828 --> 22:11.662
(gasps)

22:12.831 --> 22:14.098
Aah!

22:18.737 --> 22:20.671
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Okay, good news.</i>

22:20.673 --> 22:22.673
<i>While petra is washing off</i>
<i>that ridiculous mask,</i>

22:22.675 --> 22:24.942
<i>Jane is concocting something</i>
<i>relatively believable.</i>

22:34.052 --> 22:35.886
Well, I knew we were
meeting up for coffee later.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.488
I just didn't know it would
be in my dressing room.

22:37.490 --> 22:39.390
<i>There's only one problem.</i>

22:47.733 --> 22:49.734
I saw you earlier
outside the crime scene,

22:49.736 --> 22:51.068
And something seemed off,

22:51.070 --> 22:52.903
And then you took
some sort of pill,

22:52.905 --> 22:55.039
So I checked your bathroom
and then your dressing room.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.775
In case you had
a problem.

23:00.078 --> 23:01.779
Well, you were right.

23:01.781 --> 23:03.581
I did take a pill.

23:03.583 --> 23:04.882
A xanax.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.851
I got a prescription
two years ago

23:06.853 --> 23:09.487
After I found out my
husband had cancer.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.789
I've taken three.

23:11.791 --> 23:13.657
One after he
was diagnosed,

23:13.659 --> 23:15.893
One when he had an
eight-hour surgery and...

23:15.895 --> 23:17.661
One today,

23:17.663 --> 23:20.064
After his best friend was
murdered in our hotel.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.565
God. Of course.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.067
I'm so sorry.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.468
Don't be.

23:24.470 --> 23:26.737
You're giving a baby
away to strangers.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.806
Of course you're gonna
want to check up on us.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.775
Let me show you something.

23:34.146 --> 23:36.414
Well, I wanted to put the crib
closer to the window

23:36.416 --> 23:37.882
So the baby could see
the ocean,

23:37.884 --> 23:39.650
But then I read
that could be dangerous,

23:39.652 --> 23:42.153
Because window cords
could be a choking hazard.

23:43.855 --> 23:45.823
Oh, my god.

23:45.825 --> 23:48.826
I can't believe
I'm crying right now.

23:48.828 --> 23:50.895
I'm officially hormonal.

23:52.164 --> 23:54.432
It's beautiful.

23:58.570 --> 24:00.638
â™ª

24:21.526 --> 24:22.993
(weakly):
Uh...

24:25.864 --> 24:27.932
<i>Inhale. Exhale.</i>

24:27.934 --> 24:29.767
(inhales deeply)
<i>inhale.</i>

24:29.769 --> 24:31.469
(exhales)
<i>exhale.</i>

24:31.471 --> 24:33.537
(chuckles)

24:46.718 --> 24:48.586
Ah.

24:54.626 --> 24:56.627
<i>...Porque...</i>

24:56.629 --> 24:59.029
<i>Â¿sÃ­?</i>

25:13.879 --> 25:15.946
â™ª

25:19.618 --> 25:20.985
What happened?

25:26.057 --> 25:27.992
He snowed you, ma.
He's an actor.

25:38.670 --> 25:41.171
No. It's too much
for her to handle right now.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.718
The keycard log places petra
up in her penthouse,

25:54.720 --> 25:56.820
Exactly where she said she was
during the murder.

25:56.822 --> 25:58.322
Still think
she's guilty?

25:58.324 --> 25:59.957
(knock at door)

25:59.959 --> 26:01.592
Sorry. I-I know
you're working.

26:01.594 --> 26:03.761
It's just, I was up
in petra's penthouse, and...

26:03.763 --> 26:06.230
(stammers)
can I talk to you?

26:06.232 --> 26:08.299
Sure.

26:10.168 --> 26:12.670
So, apparently, I am hormonal

26:12.672 --> 26:14.104
Because I snuck up
into petra's suite,

26:14.106 --> 26:15.773
And you were right
and I was wrong.

26:15.775 --> 26:17.041
You snuck into
her suite?

26:17.043 --> 26:18.342
Yeah. I know. I know...

26:18.344 --> 26:19.677
I just... I'm sorry

26:19.679 --> 26:21.345
That I was freaking out
on you before.

26:21.347 --> 26:23.614
I was just so sure that
there was something going on,

26:23.616 --> 26:26.717
But I was wrong,
and she's lovely.

26:26.719 --> 26:28.852
And I promise I wasn't
swayed by the fact

26:28.854 --> 26:31.288
That she gave us the
presidential suite for tonight.

26:31.290 --> 26:32.723
You told her
about tonight?

26:32.725 --> 26:35.359
No, not that... Not that it
was our first time.

26:35.361 --> 26:38.762
Just that we needed
some time to ourselves.

26:38.764 --> 26:40.864
Anyway, I'm sorry
about before.

26:40.866 --> 26:43.300
I really am.

26:43.302 --> 26:45.769
Let me make it up
to you tonight.

26:46.972 --> 26:48.772
Good. Good.

26:48.774 --> 26:50.774
Okay, I'll meet you at 8:00.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.376
And I'll come straight
from church.

26:52.378 --> 26:54.311
Y-you're going to church first?

26:54.313 --> 26:55.779
Yeah. My grandma called,

26:55.781 --> 26:57.881
And she insisted
for some reason.

26:57.883 --> 27:00.784
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
tell her, obviously.

27:00.786 --> 27:02.653
Priest:
<i>God is faithful.</i>

27:02.655 --> 27:05.756
He will not let you be tempted
beyond what you can bear.

27:05.758 --> 27:07.324
And when we are tempted,

27:07.326 --> 27:10.628
He will provide a way out
so that we can endure.

27:23.375 --> 27:24.642
Mom! Shh.

27:24.644 --> 27:26.043
I'm trying to listen
to the priest.

27:31.683 --> 27:33.684
Priest:
God will deliver us from sin

27:33.686 --> 27:35.653
If we choose to follow him.

27:35.655 --> 27:39.823
Will you follow god,
or will you choose instead

27:39.825 --> 27:43.661
To continue to lie
to your <i>abuela?</i>

27:43.663 --> 27:46.830
Yes, jane, I am talking to you.

27:46.832 --> 27:50.167
Abuela taught you
that a lie by omission

27:50.169 --> 27:52.336
Is still a lie.

27:52.338 --> 27:55.706
â™ª tonight's the night
you'll lie in bed â™ª

27:55.708 --> 27:57.341
â™ª you should tell the truth

27:57.343 --> 28:00.344
â™ª but you'll lie instead

28:00.346 --> 28:02.780
â™ª don't have sex, jane

28:02.782 --> 28:05.783
â™ª don't have sex

28:05.785 --> 28:10.287
â™ª can you really lie
to my face? â™ª

28:10.289 --> 28:11.989
Choir:
â™ª can you really lie

28:11.991 --> 28:14.925
â™ª to her face?

28:14.927 --> 28:17.027
â™ª virginity for you and me

28:17.029 --> 28:18.696
â™ª if you keep your legs closed

28:18.698 --> 28:22.032
â™ª keep them closed

28:22.034 --> 28:25.769
â™ª keep them closed...

28:33.812 --> 28:35.713
I'm gonna have sex
with michael tonight.

28:35.715 --> 28:37.347
Hallelujah!

28:46.825 --> 28:48.459
Come on. Relax, ma.

28:48.461 --> 28:50.060
They're practically
married already.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.235
Abuela, you can't forbid it.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.804
I told you because I didn't
feel right not telling you.

29:00.806 --> 29:02.906
I wasn't asking for permission.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.454
And things changed.

29:17.456 --> 29:19.423
I'm pregnant and a virgin.

29:19.425 --> 29:22.926
And I'm... I just don't
think god will forsake me.

29:22.928 --> 29:25.929
I'm sorry, I just don't.

29:27.298 --> 29:28.999
I have to go.

29:29.001 --> 29:31.835
I'm sorry
I disappointed you, abuela.

29:31.837 --> 29:33.403
Honey?

29:33.405 --> 29:35.172
Did you wax?

29:35.174 --> 29:37.775
Clean everything up
down there?

29:37.777 --> 29:40.010
(sighs)
I love you.

29:45.116 --> 29:47.851
(singing in spanish)

30:05.270 --> 30:07.070
(continues singing in spanish)

30:08.540 --> 30:10.374
This is...

30:10.376 --> 30:11.842
Some memorial.

30:11.844 --> 30:13.844
Trust me.
It's very zaz.

30:13.846 --> 30:15.479
How'd you get your
dad to agree?

30:15.481 --> 30:17.548
I thought that he wanted
to distance the hotel.

30:17.550 --> 30:18.882
Because he didn't
want bad press.

30:18.884 --> 30:20.350
Oh.

30:20.352 --> 30:22.219
But then he realized
he'd get even worse press

30:22.221 --> 30:24.288
If word got out
that he forbid his own son

30:24.290 --> 30:25.956
From throwing a memorial
for his college roommate.

30:25.958 --> 30:28.325
Nice work.
Thank you.

30:28.327 --> 30:29.993
(song ends, crowd applauds)

30:29.995 --> 30:32.062
(romantic ballad begins)

30:35.834 --> 30:37.534
What?

30:38.503 --> 30:40.871
I just...

30:40.873 --> 30:42.873
I love this song.

30:42.875 --> 30:44.575
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And maybe it was the music,</i>

30:44.577 --> 30:46.243
<i>Or the moment,</i>
<i>or the vodka cranberry</i>

30:46.245 --> 30:47.911
<i>He had downed too quickly,</i>

30:47.913 --> 30:50.480
<i>But suddenly rafael</i>
<i>was extending his hand.</i>

30:50.482 --> 30:51.882
Dance with me.

30:51.884 --> 30:53.483
What? No.

30:53.485 --> 30:55.252
What? You just said
you love this song.

30:55.254 --> 30:57.154
No.

30:58.156 --> 30:59.489
Dance with me.

31:03.161 --> 31:05.395
Mmm...

31:09.601 --> 31:12.002
(song continues in spanish)

31:26.351 --> 31:28.051
(jane chuckles)

31:33.958 --> 31:36.426
Thank you.

31:36.428 --> 31:37.928
I have to...

31:37.930 --> 31:40.664
I'm gonna go meet with michael,
so... I, um...

31:40.666 --> 31:42.266
I'll see you later.

31:42.268 --> 31:45.602
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Jane told herself</i>

31:45.604 --> 31:48.071
<i>Her heart could be racing</i>
<i>for any number of reasons--</i>

31:48.073 --> 31:51.074
<i>Hormones, nerves,</i>
<i>alba's spicy chicken arepas.</i>

31:51.076 --> 31:52.609
What was happening was nothing.

31:54.545 --> 31:56.980
<i>This was who she wanted.</i>

31:56.982 --> 31:58.382
Wow.

31:58.384 --> 31:59.983
You look...

31:59.985 --> 32:01.251
So do you.

32:08.026 --> 32:09.593
Dance with me?

32:09.595 --> 32:11.295
Oh, no, no dancing.

32:11.297 --> 32:13.030
It's okay.

32:13.032 --> 32:14.965
You're sweating.

32:14.967 --> 32:17.067
Are you nervous?

32:17.069 --> 32:18.402
No.

32:18.404 --> 32:20.470
M-maybe a little.

32:23.641 --> 32:25.709
(whispering): Are you sure
you want to do this?

32:33.451 --> 32:36.286
Yeah?
Yeah, yeah.

32:38.389 --> 32:40.457
(both moaning)

32:45.997 --> 32:47.331
Rafael:
Thank you for coming.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.032
If it's your first time,

32:49.034 --> 32:50.667
We hope it's an experience
you never forget.

32:50.669 --> 32:51.668
Oh.

32:51.670 --> 32:52.669
Oh, my god.

32:52.671 --> 32:53.971
Let us fulfill your every need.

32:53.973 --> 32:55.472
Oh, here.

32:55.474 --> 32:56.573
(louder):
I'm rafael solano...

32:56.575 --> 32:57.574
Turn that off,
actually.

32:57.576 --> 32:58.575
Okay, I'm trying!

32:58.577 --> 32:59.743
...And your pleasure
I...

32:59.745 --> 33:00.978
Is my pleasure.
What if I...?

33:00.980 --> 33:01.979
I'm...
This is off.

33:01.981 --> 33:03.113
It doesn't...
I got it.

33:03.115 --> 33:05.515
There it is.

33:05.517 --> 33:07.584
(sighs)

33:10.254 --> 33:11.655
(laughs nervously)

33:11.657 --> 33:13.590
I guess...

33:13.592 --> 33:14.725
Oh, my god.

33:14.727 --> 33:16.326
I did not expect you to call.

33:16.328 --> 33:20.364
I can't stay
away from you.

33:20.366 --> 33:22.032
I try,

33:22.034 --> 33:23.734
But I can't.

33:23.736 --> 33:27.204
But, lu, now this
is important.

33:27.206 --> 33:30.007
Mmm.

33:30.009 --> 33:31.341
I'm not gonna
leave him.

33:31.343 --> 33:35.445
And you-- I need you
to understand that.

33:35.447 --> 33:38.582
This is just
a temporary thing.

33:40.518 --> 33:43.053
Okay, well, then, let's...

33:43.055 --> 33:45.589
Let's just enjoy it
while it lasts.

33:48.126 --> 33:51.695
Mmm. Do you remember
what we got that first time

33:51.697 --> 33:53.530
That we were together in that,

33:53.532 --> 33:56.066
In that motel
in fort lauderdale?

33:56.068 --> 33:58.035
(laughs)

33:58.037 --> 34:01.238
Powdered doughnuts
from the vending machine.

34:01.240 --> 34:04.041
Go (laughs) get them.

34:04.043 --> 34:06.176
Mmm.

34:11.182 --> 34:14.117
(sighs)

34:14.119 --> 34:16.186
(whistles)

34:26.731 --> 34:29.099
Baby, are you okay?

34:29.101 --> 34:31.234
Are you sure you
want to do this?

34:31.236 --> 34:32.235
I want to.

34:32.237 --> 34:33.303
I do want to.

34:33.305 --> 34:34.337
You do?

34:34.339 --> 34:35.338
Yeah.
Okay.

34:35.340 --> 34:36.540
Okay.

35:02.166 --> 35:04.801
(fire alarm sounds)

35:09.173 --> 35:10.273
Darling?

35:10.275 --> 35:11.274
What's going on?

35:11.276 --> 35:13.243
We should probably evacuate.

35:25.189 --> 35:27.457
It's probably
just a drill.

35:27.459 --> 35:28.758
Woman:
This is not a drill.

35:28.760 --> 35:31.261
Please evacuate
into the hotel lobby.

35:31.263 --> 35:32.829
Come on, hurry!

35:34.765 --> 35:37.534
Think your grandma put in
a call to the big guy?

35:37.536 --> 35:39.536
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And the truth was,</i>

35:39.538 --> 35:42.706
<i>Jane couldn't be sure</i>
<i>it wasn't divine intervention.</i>

35:42.708 --> 35:46.343
<i>Because suddenly, she was</i>
<i>confused about everything.</i>

35:53.651 --> 35:55.652
I should probably
check it out.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.721
Of course.
Yeah, go, go.

36:27.552 --> 36:29.619
Rafael:
Excuse me.

36:31.322 --> 36:33.456
It'll just be a few minutes.

36:33.458 --> 36:34.524
Thanks.

36:37.795 --> 36:40.931
I just saw my sister.

36:40.933 --> 36:43.466
And I know I need
to forgive her, but I can't.

36:43.468 --> 36:45.635
And it's not the mistake,
it's the fact that she lied.

36:47.572 --> 36:49.439
Hey, did you ever get
in touch with aaron?

36:49.441 --> 36:50.807
Aaron?

36:50.809 --> 36:51.908
Zaz's brother.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.743
You mentioned him this morning.

36:53.745 --> 36:56.346
Latin lover narrator: <i>He had not</i>
<i>got in touch with aaron.</i>

36:56.348 --> 36:59.449
<i>In fact, rafael's search for</i>
<i>zaz's brother had been stymied</i>

36:59.451 --> 37:01.785
<i>By one simple fact.</i>

37:01.787 --> 37:04.921
<i>Until this moment,</i>
<i>he never knew his name.</i>

37:04.923 --> 37:08.358
I didn't even know
he had a brother.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.260
No.

37:10.262 --> 37:11.761
Not yet.

37:15.666 --> 37:17.734
You know, the cops think
that he was seeing someone.

37:17.736 --> 37:20.537
Zaz?

37:20.539 --> 37:22.939
Yeah.

37:22.941 --> 37:25.575
I had no idea.

37:25.577 --> 37:28.778
It makes me feel like
I didn't really know him.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.780
Anyways...

37:30.782 --> 37:32.682
I guess we'll find out
who it was.

37:36.587 --> 37:39.723
So, can we talk?

37:39.725 --> 37:42.425
'cause upstairs,

37:42.427 --> 37:44.628
Besides the fire alarm
and the tv thing,

37:44.630 --> 37:47.264
Something seemed off.

37:47.266 --> 37:51.268
Yeah, you're right.

37:51.270 --> 37:53.503
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Jane thought about</i>
<i>what her</i> abuela <i>said,</i>

37:53.505 --> 37:54.571
<i>How lies spiral.</i>

37:54.573 --> 37:56.439
What is it?

37:56.441 --> 37:58.942
<i>Really, what could jane say?</i>

37:58.944 --> 38:01.611
<i>She was having feelings</i>
<i>for another man?</i>

38:01.613 --> 38:03.413
<i>But what if</i>
<i>it was just hormones,</i>

38:03.415 --> 38:06.049
<i>The result of a suddenly</i>
<i>untrustworthy gut?</i>

38:06.051 --> 38:07.851
It was my grandma.

38:07.853 --> 38:10.787
She was so upset about this,
and I tried to push past it,

38:10.789 --> 38:11.821
But, um...

38:11.823 --> 38:12.822
It's, it's okay.

38:12.824 --> 38:13.890
It's okay.

38:13.892 --> 38:15.859
I-I... I understand.

38:15.861 --> 38:17.327
We'll wait, then.

38:21.432 --> 38:23.066
But what are we waiting for?

38:23.068 --> 38:24.701
I-I love you.

38:24.703 --> 38:26.736
You're the person
I want to be with.

38:26.738 --> 38:28.571
So...

38:28.573 --> 38:30.740
There's no reason why we can't
move the wedding up, right?

38:32.910 --> 38:35.745
(cell phone rings)

38:38.749 --> 38:40.817
Nadine, is this
important?

38:44.555 --> 38:46.556
What?

38:46.558 --> 38:48.658
You lied to me.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.560
We have proof your mother's
keycard was used

38:50.562 --> 38:52.829
To access a back stairwell five
minutes before the murder.

38:52.831 --> 38:54.531
A stairwell without cameras.

38:54.533 --> 38:57.400
And your mother,
who is in a wheelchair,

38:57.402 --> 38:58.835
Obviously didn't climb
those stairs.

38:58.837 --> 39:01.438
Look, I'm telling you,
I didn't kill him.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.373
Then why were you
in the stairwell?

39:04.108 --> 39:06.076
I can't say.

39:08.012 --> 39:09.646
You could go to jail.

39:09.648 --> 39:12.849
Then I'll tell them you tampered
with the crime scene.

39:12.851 --> 39:15.118
I won't go to
jail, but you will.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.354
And, of course,
you'd lose jane.

39:17.356 --> 39:19.889
So, I'd figure out a way
out of this if I were you.

39:35.773 --> 39:37.474
I'm proud of you, mom.

39:37.476 --> 39:39.409
Calling jane like that,
I know it wasn't easy.

39:44.815 --> 39:46.015
I wonder if she already...

40:00.431 --> 40:03.867
It's stupid.

40:03.869 --> 40:06.569
I barely even
know the guy.

40:06.571 --> 40:08.905
Part of me thought maybe
for a second with jane's father,

40:08.907 --> 40:10.974
I'd get
the fairy tale, too.

40:10.976 --> 40:12.575
Whatever.

40:12.577 --> 40:14.644
These pistachios suck.

40:41.539 --> 40:44.541
"always and forever, xo."

40:44.543 --> 40:47.610
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Huh.</i>

40:47.612 --> 40:50.079
<i>Maybe she'll get</i>
<i>her fairy tale after all.</i>

40:56.754 --> 40:58.188
I didn't have sex, abuela.

40:59.757 --> 41:01.224
What happened?

41:01.226 --> 41:03.159
We decided to wait
until we were married.

41:04.662 --> 41:06.563
Which is gonna be next week.

41:06.565 --> 41:08.465
(gasps, shouts)
(laughs)

41:18.676 --> 41:21.978
Latin lover narrator: <i>And that</i>
<i>night jane made a final wish.</i>

41:21.980 --> 41:23.847
<i>That she would go to bed</i>

41:23.849 --> 41:26.916
<i>And wake up without feelings</i>
<i>for rafael.</i>

41:30.688 --> 41:33.857
<i>No fireflies were hurt</i>
<i>in the making of this episode.</i>
