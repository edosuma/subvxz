29:20.846 --> 29:22.456
I ripped her arm off.

29:22.499 --> 29:23.849
I'm sure it's fine.
We don't know for sure

29:23.892 --> 29:25.764
if Josefina is actually
in that paper.

29:25.807 --> 29:27.635
Well, we don't
not know that, either.

29:27.678 --> 29:30.246
Um, I'd kind of like
to know where we are.

29:30.290 --> 29:31.770
The Blue Camellia.

29:33.249 --> 29:35.861
Exclusive bar.
Magical patrons only.

29:35.904 --> 29:37.776
You have to know someone
who knows someone.

29:40.256 --> 29:41.997
Are those horns?

29:42.041 --> 29:43.390
So this is where you've been
sneaking off to every night.

29:43.433 --> 29:45.653
Oh, no. You don't get to judge.

29:45.696 --> 29:47.220
Not with the whole
Batgirl and Robin bit

29:47.263 --> 29:48.830
you and Jordan have going on.

29:48.874 --> 29:50.614
You know about that?

29:50.658 --> 29:52.834
Look, guys, um,
I'm not usually

29:52.878 --> 29:55.445
one to get in between
a family beef, but

29:55.489 --> 29:56.707
can we go back
to the part

29:56.751 --> 29:58.405
where you said that
I was the new one?

29:58.448 --> 29:59.972
You've done
this before?

30:00.015 --> 30:01.625
Just a few years,
like, three or four.

30:01.669 --> 30:03.105
Can we talk about that
after we figure out

30:03.149 --> 30:05.194
how to reverse
our paper doll cousin?

30:05.238 --> 30:07.066
Let's ask Roxie. She can help.

30:07.109 --> 30:08.850
Who's Roxie?

30:08.894 --> 30:10.504
I don't care what some banshee
scream-called you.

30:10.547 --> 30:11.897
You know
my rules.

30:11.940 --> 30:14.334
Keep your business
out of my business. Duncan.

30:15.814 --> 30:16.815
Smoke him out.

30:16.858 --> 30:17.772
PATRON:No, no,

30:17.816 --> 30:19.034
wait!

30:19.078 --> 30:21.950
That's Roxie.
She runs the place.

30:21.994 --> 30:25.606
Hide your girlfriends, folks.
Mel Vera is back in the house.

30:30.654 --> 30:33.222
Look, if Lady Picasso here
really is

30:33.266 --> 30:34.833
a manifestor,
especially one who doesn't know

30:34.876 --> 30:36.617
her abracadabra from gesundheit,

30:36.660 --> 30:39.968
then what attacked you was
a being from the negative space.

30:41.361 --> 30:43.580
From the what?KAELA: A negative space.

30:43.624 --> 30:46.322
The term for the unused area
around a drawn figure.

30:46.366 --> 30:48.020
So you're saying

30:48.063 --> 30:51.414
that when my apple manifested,

30:51.458 --> 30:54.678
and Josefina
took a bite...

30:54.722 --> 30:56.898
She became part of the
manifestation, leaving behind...

30:56.942 --> 30:59.901
Unstable negative space.

30:59.945 --> 31:01.729
Kind of like some of the ladies
you've ghosted around here.

31:01.772 --> 31:03.209
[sighs]

31:05.428 --> 31:07.169
All right, how
do we fix it?

31:07.213 --> 31:09.432
Look, I'm just spitting
theories. You want a pressurized

31:09.476 --> 31:11.043
Mumford trap
to catch a problematic dwarf,

31:11.086 --> 31:12.871
I'm your lass.
I don't know

31:12.914 --> 31:14.133
what to tell you
about your little

other than

31:16.657 --> 31:19.138

before your cousin bleeds out.

31:19.834 --> 31:20.922
What?

31:20.966 --> 31:22.576
Bleeds out?

31:22.619 --> 31:23.882
Well, you did rip her arm off.

31:26.841 --> 31:28.277
Oh, my God.

31:34.936 --> 31:38.070
If I'm the cause of this, we
need to go back and fix it now.

31:38.113 --> 31:39.767
Do either of you have any idea
how to do that?

31:39.810 --> 31:41.160
You're the artist.

31:41.203 --> 31:43.858
Yeah, I paint on walls
and canvas,

31:43.902 --> 31:45.773
not negative space beings.

31:45.816 --> 31:47.253
I have Josefina's arm.

31:48.254 --> 31:50.430
Okay, well...

31:50.473 --> 31:52.475
I have some paints in my bag.

31:52.519 --> 31:54.434
Maybe I can go back and fill in
the chaotic space?

31:54.477 --> 31:56.044
We can't just
go rushing back.

31:56.088 --> 31:58.525
Someone's gonna get
hurt. We need a plan.

32:00.222 --> 32:01.876
Kaela, you don't understand.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.095
This is really dangerous.

32:03.138 --> 32:04.226
We can't just
go running back there.

32:04.270 --> 32:05.619
What I can't do is be

32:05.662 --> 32:07.664
the reason
that somebody bleeds out.

32:16.847 --> 32:19.067
Supe totes thanks
for healing me.

32:19.111 --> 32:22.679
And the others.

was the only Whitelighter left.

32:25.204 --> 32:27.119
I'm...

32:27.162 --> 32:29.904
I'm not a Whitelighter, exactly.
I...

32:32.080 --> 32:34.039
Honestly not sure what I am.

32:34.082 --> 32:36.824
Well, whatever you are,
I can see why Maggie likes you.

32:36.867 --> 32:39.696
[soft chuckle]
I'll call her and Mel,

32:39.740 --> 32:41.960
get them to come
help you find your sister.No.

32:42.003 --> 32:44.223
This is a pixie matter.

32:44.266 --> 32:47.400
We'll find her, fix it.

32:47.443 --> 32:48.879
Do you have any idea

32:48.923 --> 32:51.012
what caused your sister
to hulk out?

32:53.362 --> 32:55.843
Maybe the goddess was
displeased with her offering?

32:59.281 --> 33:02.458
But that wouldn't explain
the super cray bat wings.

33:05.548 --> 33:07.637
Be right back.[laughs softly]

33:27.527 --> 33:29.572
[creature roaring]Do you think

33:29.616 --> 33:31.574
we could staple
her back together?

KAELA:
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

33:34.447 --> 33:36.275
Uh, you go for the paints,

33:36.318 --> 33:38.103
and I'll try to cover you.

33:39.582 --> 33:41.497
I'm sorry Josefina!
I'm so sorry.

33:41.541 --> 33:42.585
I'm going.

Well, that didn't work.Yeah.

die because of what I did.

Hey. You couldn't have known.

Who are you?

Um...

The Power of Three.

35:48.711 --> 35:50.322
Yes, it's what we
thought would happen

35:50.365 --> 35:52.280
when we tried that
thing in the gym.

35:52.324 --> 35:54.891
Why'd it work this time?

35:54.935 --> 35:56.937
Maybe because the first time
we tried it,

35:56.980 --> 35:58.199
you thought we were nuts,

35:58.243 --> 36:03.161
and this time, you believed.

36:03.204 --> 36:06.729
And the reason
you're the "new" one

36:06.773 --> 36:08.818
