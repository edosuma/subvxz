OH, MY GOD.

00:08.609 --> 00:09.643
WHAT?

00:09.677 --> 00:11.345
OH, AS A FRIEND,
I GOT TO TELL YOU,

00:11.379 --> 00:12.480
YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.

00:12.513 --> 00:13.681
I WOULD NEVER
HAVE SEX WITH YOU

00:13.714 --> 00:14.682
LOOKING LIKE THIS.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.084
OKAY, I NEED YOU
TO STOP USING

00:16.117 --> 00:17.218
YOUR ABILITY
TO HAVE SEX WITH ME

00:17.251 --> 00:19.053
AS A BAROMETER
FOR HOW I SHOULD DRESS.

00:19.087 --> 00:20.588
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
IT'S INGRAINED.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.256
MORGAN, I'VE BEEN
WORKING NON-STOP.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.257
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO LOOK

00:23.291 --> 00:24.325
MY NORMAL,
GLAMOROUS SELF.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.326
OKAY, NO, I'M SORRY.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.827
BEING BUSY
IS NOT AN EXCUSE.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.229
YOU KNOW,
FEMINISM NOWADAYS,

00:28.262 --> 00:30.231
IT'S ALL ABOUT REMINDING
WORKING WOMEN THAT

00:30.264 --> 00:31.599
THEY HAVE
TO LOOK HOT, TOO.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.334
IT'S LIKE THAT BOOK,

00:33.367 --> 00:34.435
LEAN IN,
BY SHERYL SANDBERG?

00:34.468 --> 00:35.536
YEAH, IT'S ABOUT HOW,
YOU KNOW,

00:35.569 --> 00:37.671
GIRLS HAVE TO LEAN IN,
SO THEIR BOOBS LOOK BIGGER.

00:37.705 --> 00:38.672
UGH...

00:38.706 --> 00:39.840
NO, IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.209
IT'S ABOUT...
SOMETHING ELSE.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.210
I DIDN'T READ IT.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.211
I THINK IT IS.

YOU'VE BEEN WORKING HARD.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.287
GOT ANY BIG
PLANS TONIGHT?

00:53.321 --> 00:54.722
I DO, IN FACT.

00:54.755 --> 00:56.324
I'M PERFORMING A C-SECTION
AND THEN I'M GOING HOME

00:56.357 --> 00:58.259
TO GIVE MYSELF
AN ALLERGY TEST.

00:58.292 --> 01:01.229
I'VE HAD THESE RED ITCHY
HIVES ALONG MY RIBCAGE

IT'S A LANOLIN ALLERGY,

DOING TONIGHT?

01:07.735 --> 01:10.538
YANA AND I ARE GOING
TO DINNER AND A PLAY.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.506
FRIDAY NIGHT
IS A DATE NIGHT.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.242
(Mindy)
THAT'S VERY NICE.

01:14.275 --> 01:15.276
YANA,
WHAT DO YOU DO?

01:15.309 --> 01:16.744
I'M--
HOW YOU SAY IT?

01:16.777 --> 01:18.246
A ASS MODEL.

OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S HOW I KNOW YOU.

01:25.253 --> 01:27.121
YOU WERE SO GOOD
IN THE INTERVIEW.

01:27.155 --> 01:29.390

IS ALSO ACTIVITIES.

THE HELL WAS THAT,
YOU DWEEB?

01:37.898 --> 01:38.866
I WAS COOL,
I THOUGHT.

THAT GUY AND YOU,

01:39.900 --> 01:41.369
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE TOGETHER.

01:41.402 --> 01:42.236
OKAY, MORGAN.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.138
EVEN IF I LIKED HIM,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

01:44.172 --> 01:46.240
HE'S WITH THE SECOND-HOTTEST
WOMAN IN THE UNIVERSE.

01:46.274 --> 01:47.375
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT EVEN
THE SECOND-HOTTEST PERSON

01:47.408 --> 01:48.509
ON THE FLOOR.,

01:48.542 --> 01:50.311
ESPECIALLY SINCE DOUG
BECAME DESIREE.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.312
DAMN IT.

01:51.345 --> 01:52.746
OKAY.
NO, NO, NO.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.348
I WANT YOU TO STAY
ON THAT ELEVATOR.

01:54.382 --> 01:56.350
YOU DO NOT GET OFF OF HERE
UNTIL YOU THINK ABOUT

01:56.384 --> 01:57.218
HOW YOU ACTED JUST NOW.

01:57.251 --> 01:58.419
I HAVE TO BE ALONE
WITH MY THOUGHTS?

02:13.234 --> 02:15.303
CAN YOU PLEASE CHECK
LOST AND FOUND FOR MY PURSE.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.671
IT HAS MY WALLET AND MY KEYS
AND MY PHONE IN IT.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.407
AND, UM, YOU'RE
SUPER CATHOLIC, RIGHT?

02:19.440 --> 02:21.275
JUST DON'T CHECK
THE ZIPPER COMPARTMENT.

02:21.309 --> 02:22.843
MANNY IS IN CHARGE
OF THE LOST AND FOUND,

02:22.876 --> 02:24.278
BUT HE'S ON A DATE.

02:24.312 --> 02:26.780
IT'S, YOU KNOW, FRIDAY NIGHT.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.416
SO THAT'S, LIKE,
OFFICIALLY A THING NOW?

02:28.449 --> 02:29.450
YEAH.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.319
MAN, IT'S LIKE THERE WAS
A TAYLOR SWIFT SONG CALLED

02:31.352 --> 02:32.520
FRIDAY NIGHT DATE NIGHT.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.455
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S ALREADY MY FAVORITE SONG.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.823
WHY DON'T YOU
STAY AT A HOTEL?

02:35.856 --> 02:38.259
YOU LOVE DROPPING TOWELS
ON THE FLOOR.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.827
YOU TWEETED
THAT YESTERDAY.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.962
I CAN'T PAY, BECAUSE
I DON'T HAVE MY WALLET.

YOU KNOW WHAT?
YEAH?

02:42.996 --> 02:43.897
YOU LIVE AROUND HERE.

02:43.931 --> 02:44.798
I SHOULD JUST SPEND THE NIGHT
AT YOUR PLACE.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.734
NO, NO, NO.
CALL ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.436
THE ONLY NUMBER I HAVE
MEMORIZED IS MY THAI PLACE.

02:48.469 --> 02:49.803
THEY'RE NOT GONNA
LET ME SPEND THE NIGHT,

02:49.837 --> 02:50.804
WHICH IS SO UNFAIR,

02:50.838 --> 02:53.774
BECAUSE I KNOW THEY
HAVE MATTRESSES BACK THERE.

02:53.807 --> 02:54.775
PLEASE, DANNY.

02:54.808 --> 02:56.310
NO.

02:56.344 --> 02:57.411
AND YOU CAN'T GET
ON MY COMPUTER,

02:57.445 --> 02:59.780
BECAUSE THE LAST TIME, YOU
CHANGED MY WIFI NETWORK NAME

02:59.813 --> 03:01.282
TO "LEAVE MILEY ALONE"

03:01.315 --> 03:02.616

HOW TO CHANGE IT BACK.

JUST LAYING ABOUT.

WITH YOU?

THINKING ABOUT

HOW WHEN MY MOM
WAS MY AGE,

SHE'S ALREADY MARRIED AND I WAS,
LIKE, FIVE YEARS OLD.

JUST A CHILD BRIDE.

IT'S ALL MESSED UP
OVER THERE.

HEY, HEY.
THAT'S VERY OFFENSIVE.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.708
I'M SORRY.
SORRY.

03:27.741 --> 03:30.778
AH, DANNY.
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

03:30.811 --> 03:32.413
IF I HAD A BOYFRIEND
OR A HUSBAND,

03:32.446 --> 03:34.348
HE WOULD HAVE COME
AND PICKED ME UP TONIGHT

03:34.382 --> 03:35.916
AND I WOULDN'T BE
IN THIS SITUATION.

03:35.949 --> 03:38.252
I'M NEVER GONNA
FIND ANYONE.

03:38.286 --> 03:39.653
I JUST HOPE
MY PARENTS DON'T MIND

IS GONNA DIE WITH ME.

FORGOT ABOUT HIM.

APPEARED TO ME AND SAID,

04:04.512 --> 04:05.879
"IT'S NOT YOUR TIME YET."

04:05.913 --> 04:07.348
OH, MY GOD.

GO THROUGH HER STUFF.

OH, DUDE.
SHE'S GOT TEXTS.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.468
YEAH, LET'S
GO THROUGH IT.

04:37.378 --> 04:38.379
WOW.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.813

NO, NO, NO.

RIGHT NOW.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.084
[laughs]
NO, NO, NO, NO...

04:44.117 --> 04:46.387
YES. IF A GIRL DOESN'T
RESPOND TO ME IMMEDIATELY,

04:46.420 --> 04:48.021
THAT MEANS SHE'S EITHER
STUCK UP, DEAD, OR LIVING

OF WHICH ARE DEAL BREAKERS.

I WOULDN'T NOTICE.

RINSE A TOOTHBRUSH

AFTER YOU USE IT,
IT'S LIKE NO ONE USED IT.

I FEEL A LITTLE WEIRD
TELLING YOU, ACTUALLY.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.902
[both laughing]

07:16.804 --> 07:17.671
(Amy)
SO YOU'RE ENGAGED.

07:17.705 --> 07:19.640
HOW LONG HAVE YOU GUYS
BEEN TOGETHER THEN?

07:19.673 --> 07:21.775
SHORT VERSION?
WE MET IN ST. BARTHS.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.777
WE MET THROUGH MUTUAL FRIENDS
AT THE RESORT'S

07:23.811 --> 07:25.012
COMMUNAL DINING TABLE.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.980
FIRST NIGHT, WE WANTED
TO KILL EACH OTHER.

07:27.014 --> 07:28.582
SECOND NIGHT,
I TOLD THE MAITRE D',

07:28.616 --> 07:31.519
"SEAT ME ANYWHERE
EXCEPT NEXT TO THIS JERK."

07:31.552 --> 07:32.520
CALL IT FATE,

07:32.553 --> 07:34.755
BUT THAT NIGHT,
WE FELL IN LOVE.

07:34.788 --> 07:35.823
AND WE MADE LOVE.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.190
WOW.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.959
AND THAT'S WHERE
WE CAME UP WITH THIS GUY.

07:38.992 --> 07:41.629
YEAH, I'M WITH CHILD.
IT'S A BOY.

07:41.662 --> 07:42.796
IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL PEOPLE,

07:42.830 --> 07:43.897
BUT WE'RE JUST SO EXCITED.

07:43.931 --> 07:46.834
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS.
IT'S SUCH A ROMANTIC STORY.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.101
YEAH.
WHERE'S YOUR RING?

07:48.135 --> 07:50.704
IT WAS A BLOOD DIAMOND AND WE
HAD TO GIVE IT BACK TO AFRICA.

07:50.738 --> 07:51.639
WE GAVE IT BACK.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.040
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
RIGHT?

07:53.073 --> 07:54.508
(both)
SO...

07:54.542 --> 07:56.143
LET'S, AH--WE'RE
GONNA HEAD UP--UPSTAIRS.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.778
OKAY, WE'LL
SEE YOU LATER.
OH.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.146
GOT TO GET STARTED
ON BABY NUMBER TWO,

07:59.179 --> 08:00.648
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
[chuckles]

08:00.681 --> 08:01.715
I DO...

08:01.749 --> 08:04.084
I'M SORRY,
I NEVER GOT YOUR NAME.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.687
IT'S CHLOE.
CHLOE SILVERADO.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.122
CHLOE SILVERADO.

08:09.156 --> 08:12.125
[playful orchestral music]

08:12.159 --> 08:20.167

08:25.238 --> 08:27.240
[sighs]

08:29.309 --> 08:31.779
[phone beeping]

08:31.812 --> 08:33.914
TELL HIM
YOU'RE TAKING A BATH

08:33.947 --> 08:35.783
AND THAT YOUR BOOBS
ARE DIRTY

08:35.816 --> 08:37.818
AND THAT YOU WISH SOMEONE
COULD HELP CLEAN THEM.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.787
NO, I'M SORRY, DR. PRENTICE.
I CAN'T DO THIS.

08:39.820 --> 08:40.854
IT'S GETTING RAUNCHY.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.856
MORGAN, COME ON.
THINK ABOUT IT.

08:42.890 --> 08:45.693
CLIFF IS A NORMAL GUY.
HIS LIFE IS REALLY BORING.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.094
UNTIL ONE NIGHT,

08:47.127 --> 08:50.764
CLIFF GETS INTO A VERY SEXY
TEXT SITUATION WITH A GIRL

08:50.798 --> 08:53.701
THAT GOES
A LITTLE TOO FAR.

08:53.734 --> 08:56.136
MINDY DOES THIS FOR HIM,
CLIFF GETS HOOKED FOR GOOD--

08:56.169 --> 08:57.738
[claps]
MAKE IT SO.

09:04.778 --> 09:07.681
(Mindy)
I CAN'T BELIEVE THE ONLY SNACK
YOU HAD IS SUGAR CUBES.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.850
DANNY? DANNY.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.051
DO YOU KNOW
HOW THE WINDMILL WORKS?

09:11.084 --> 09:13.654
IT IS UNBELIEVABLE.
IT'S SO MESSED UP.

09:13.687 --> 09:14.655
OKAY.
WAIT.

09:14.688 --> 09:15.723
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.691
I THINK IT'D BE BETTER
IF YOU READ YOUR BOOK IN HERE

09:17.725 --> 09:19.026
AND I'LL GO IN THE OTHER ROOM
WITH MY LUDLUM.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.728
[sighs]
ACTUALLY, I'M SLEEPY.

09:20.761 --> 09:21.762
DANNY, CAN WE JUST
GO TO BED NOW, PLEASE?

09:21.795 --> 09:23.063
YEAH.
DIFFERENT BEDS.

09:23.096 --> 09:26.700
SURE. AH, I'M GONNA GRAB YOU
A PILLOW FOR THE COUCH.

09:26.734 --> 09:27.901
THAT'S INTERESTING,

09:27.935 --> 09:29.670
'CAUSE WHEN MY COUSIN
COMES TO VISIT ME,

09:29.703 --> 09:33.040
I GIVE HER MY BED AND THEN,
LIKE, I SLEEP ON THE COUCH.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.809
GREAT, SO YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE
SLEEPING ON COUCHES.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.680
(male narrator on TV)
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE
AFRICAN SUBCONTINENT,

09:39.713 --> 09:41.281
THE POPULATION
HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY

09:41.314 --> 09:42.349
FEW AND FAR BETWEEN.
DANNY?

09:42.382 --> 09:44.718
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?

09:44.752 --> 09:45.552
COME ON.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.287
ARE YOU WATCHING
THE NATURE CHANNEL?

09:47.320 --> 09:48.856
I LOVE THIS.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.390
IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY
I DON'T LIVE IN THOSE PLACES.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.793
YEAH?

09:52.826 --> 09:55.162
NO, DON'T...
I LIKE THIS SIDE SMOOTH.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.197
GREAT.
COZY.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.431
(male narrator on TV)
A THRILLING SEX RITUAL

09:58.465 --> 10:01.334
SO VIGOROUS AND TITILLATING
IT IS SAID TO HAVE INSPIRED--

10:01.368 --> 10:03.036
OH, BOY.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.706
[giggles]
OKAY, DON'T--NO.
STOP.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.140
OF ALL THE THINGS
FROGS DO,

10:07.174 --> 10:09.176
ALL THE VERY INTERESTING
THINGS THEY DO,

10:09.209 --> 10:10.377
YOU'RE GONNA
SHOW ME THIS? NO.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.780
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.081
CREATURE FEATURE.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.348
WHAT IS THIS?

10:15.382 --> 10:17.951
(Mindy)
I REALLY DON'T
LIKE SCARY MOVIES.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.720
OH, GOD.
DON'T GO OVER THERE.

10:19.753 --> 10:22.222
(Mindy)
I CAN'T STOP TALKING
WHEN I'M SCARED.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.124
[gasps]
AH!
OKAY.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.059
DANNY, DANNY,
I'M SO SCARED.

10:26.093 --> 10:27.861
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, LET GO.
DANNY.

10:27.895 --> 10:29.196
WHY DID YOU
MAKE ME WATCH THAT?
LET GO.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.298
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

10:31.331 --> 10:34.301
GET YOUR LEGS OFF ME NOW.
THIS HAS GONE FAR ENOUGH.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.169
WE NEED TO TALK.
OKAY.

10:36.203 --> 10:37.337
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:37.370 --> 10:41.374
I ADMIT IT.
I FARTED.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.176
I DID IT BECAUSE I WAS SCARED,
AND IT WAS WRONG

10:43.210 --> 10:44.211
AND WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.779
NO, NOT ABOUT THAT.

10:45.813 --> 10:47.848
OKAY, I SPILLED RED WINE
ON YOUR SOFA CUSHION.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.249
AND YES,
I TURNED IT OVER.

10:49.282 --> 10:50.784
AND THEN I GOT
CHOCOLATE SYRUP ON THAT.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.419
I WRAPPED IT UP WITH BLANKETS
AND I THOUGHT

10:52.452 --> 10:53.687
YOU'D JUST BLAME IT
ON YOUR MAID.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.322
OKAY, STOP ADMITTING
THINGS TO ME.

10:55.355 --> 10:56.423
I FARTED AGAIN.

10:56.456 --> 10:59.026
STOP!
AND STOP FARTING, OKAY?

10:59.059 --> 11:01.729
WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT THIS.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.964
YOU AND ME.
OKAY?

11:03.997 --> 11:06.934
YEAH, OKAY.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.936
NO, NOT HERE.
NOT IN MY BED. OUT THERE.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.570
I WAS VERY COMFORTABLE
LYING IN YOUR BED.

11:10.603 --> 11:12.339
OKAY, THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE,
ALL RIGHT?
I DON'T KNOW WHY
WE HAVE TO COME OUT HERE.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.007
BUT WHY?
[screams]
OH!

11:14.041 --> 11:17.277
SO CHLOE, HOW MUCH DO
YOU KNOW ABOUT YOUR FIANCE?

11:19.379 --> 11:21.348
(Cliff)
OH, MY GOODNESS, DR. LAHIRI.

11:35.896 --> 11:36.997
WOW.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.203
[phone buzzing]

11:45.305 --> 11:46.506
(both)
YES!

11:46.539 --> 11:47.975
[phone buzzing]

11:49.009 --> 11:50.744
(both)
NO!

11:52.980 --> 11:54.882
SO DANNY PROBABLY TOLD YOU
I WAS CRAZY, RIGHT?

11:54.915 --> 11:56.449
I WOULD NEVER SAY THAT.
YES, HE DID.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.018
LOOK, I DID THE MATH.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.987
DANNY HAD SEX WITH ME
WHILE YOU WERE PREGNANT.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.188
WHAT?

12:01.221 --> 12:02.189
A LOT.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.857
DANIEL,
IS THIS TRUE?

12:03.891 --> 12:06.459
IT IS POSSIBLE.
I THINK IT COULD BE POSSIBLE.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.128
ARGH!
BASTARD.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.230
THAT WAS A LOT HARDER
THAN IT NEEDED TO BE.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.165
I FEEL LIKE I MUST HEAR
EVERY DETAIL,

12:12.199 --> 12:14.001
ALTHOUGH IT WILL BE
PAINFUL TO HEAR IT.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.175
[sighs]

12:23.343 --> 12:27.014
WELL, WELL, WELL.
CLIFF, THE LAWYER
FROM OUR BUILDING.

12:27.047 --> 12:29.549
OH, I'M SORRY.
I THOUGHT, AH...

12:29.582 --> 12:30.550
IS MINDY HERE?

12:30.583 --> 12:32.519
YEAH, MINDY'S HERE.

12:32.552 --> 12:36.924
SHE WOULDN'T MISS HER
ANNUAL VETERANS DAY PARTY.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.258
GET IN HERE MAN.
COME ON.
COME ON.

12:38.291 --> 12:40.027
COME IN, YOU.
THIS IS A
BEAUTIFUL OVERCOAT.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.829
YES, YOU LOOK GREAT,
BY THE WAY.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.263
HEATHER!

12:43.296 --> 12:45.265
HI.
IT'S, AH, MORGAN.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.067
YES.
HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.102
WE'RE ACTUALLY HAVING
A PRETTY COOL EVENT IN HERE.

12:49.136 --> 12:52.105
SOME SINGLE GUYS--
SINGLE GIRLS?

12:52.139 --> 12:54.942
YOU SHOULD, UH,
CHECK IT OUT.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.076
IF YOU THINK YOU
CAN HANDLE IT.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.144
I WAS GONNA FOLD MY LAUNDRY,

12:57.177 --> 13:00.147
BUT I CAN'T MISS
AN EVENT LIKE THIS.

13:00.180 --> 13:03.350
GUESS MY LAUNDRY'S
GETTING FOLDED TOMORROW.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.552
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.554
I MIGHT QUICKLY
FOLD MY LAUNDRY.

13:07.587 --> 13:08.922
YES...

13:08.956 --> 13:11.058
(Mindy)
SO DANNY WAS KIND OF
A SEX FREAK, HUH?

13:11.091 --> 13:12.059
(Amy)
YEAH.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.260
AND THEN THERE
WERE TIMES WHEN

13:13.293 --> 13:14.294
HE DIDN'T EVEN
WANT TO HAVE SEX.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.495
YOU KNOW, HE JUST
WANTED TO EAT

13:15.528 --> 13:16.897
MELTED CHOCOLATE
OFF MY BUTT.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.165
OKAY, IT'S GETTING LATE.

13:18.198 --> 13:19.232
I THINK
MY FIANCEE HAS HEARD

13:19.266 --> 13:21.501
ABOUT AS MUCH
AS SHE CAN HANDLE.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.370
AMY, I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR YOUR HONESTY,

13:23.403 --> 13:26.606
AND, WHILE DEEPLY SADDENED
BY THIS, I THINK I'M GONNA

13:26.639 --> 13:30.844
STICK WITH DANNY, LIKE
HILARY OR HUMA, OR SILDA,

13:30.878 --> 13:32.545
OR, BRIEFLY, MARIA SHRIVER,
BEFORE SHE WAS LIKE,

13:32.579 --> 13:34.347
"WAIT, WHY AM I DOING THIS?
I'M THE RICH ONE--"

13:34.381 --> 13:36.283
OKAY, AMY, I'M GONNA
NEED MY KEY BACK NOW.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.218
SHE HAD YOUR KEY?
YEAH.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.419
WELL, YEAH,
YOU KNOW?

13:39.452 --> 13:41.054
WE WERE SPENDING MOST NIGHTS
TOGETHER AND...

13:41.088 --> 13:42.622
SO, YOU WERE SPENDING
MOST NIGHTS TOGETHER?

13:42.655 --> 13:45.392
YEAH, AND IN THE MORNING,
HE'D MAKE PANCAKES.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.327
PANCAKES?
BLUEBERRY.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.295
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.197
AMY, DO YOU MIND
WAITING HERE FOR ONE SECOND?

13:50.230 --> 13:51.965
HEY, BUDDY.

13:51.999 --> 13:53.233
GUESS WHAT?

13:53.266 --> 13:55.068
THERE IS A SOCIOPATH HERE,
AND IT'S NOT AMY, DANNY.

13:55.102 --> 13:56.469
IT'S YOU.
WHAT?

13:56.503 --> 13:57.504
YOU DO NOT MAKE PANCAKES

13:57.537 --> 13:58.538
FOR SOMEONE WHO
IS "JUST A HOOK-UP."

13:58.571 --> 14:00.140
I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT BY,
LIKE, TEN DIFFERENT GUYS.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.574
OKAY, I'M ITALIAN.
I LIKE TO COOK.

14:01.608 --> 14:02.509
COME BACK HERE.

14:02.542 --> 14:05.078
ADMIT TO ME THAT YOU
ARE NOT THIS COOL PLAYER

14:05.112 --> 14:06.146
WHO CAN JUST HOOK UP
WITH WHOEVER.

14:06.179 --> 14:09.549
FINE. YES, I GUESS I GET
A LITTLE LONELY SOMETIMES.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.351
YOU KNOW, IF IT'S
A LITTLE DRIZZLY OUT

14:11.384 --> 14:13.887
OR IF I SEE PHOTOS
OF THE FIRST FAMILY

14:13.921 --> 14:14.687
DOING THAT EASTER EGG HUNT.

14:14.721 --> 14:17.290
OH, DANNY,
DO YOU GET LONELY SOME--?

14:17.324 --> 14:18.458
YES, THAT'S WHAT
I JUST SAID.

14:18.491 --> 14:19.526
OKAY, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SCREAM AT ME.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.128
CAN WE GO OUT THERE
AND TELL HER TO GO, PLEASE?

14:21.161 --> 14:24.231
YES. BUT FIRST,
YOU NEED TO MAKE THIS RIGHT.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.066
COME.

14:26.099 --> 14:28.068
(Cliff)
IS MINDY STILL
ON THAT SALSA RUN?

14:28.101 --> 14:30.904
YOU HAVE BIGGER THINGS
TO WORRY ABOUT, MY FRIEND,

14:30.938 --> 14:34.374
LIKE THIS TRIPLE WORD SCORE.

14:34.407 --> 14:36.476
YOU KNOW, YOU IMPLIED
YOU WERE BAD AT THIS GAME.

14:36.509 --> 14:40.080
PERHAPS I WAS
BEING DISINGENUOUS.

14:40.113 --> 14:42.882
YOU WERE.

14:47.187 --> 14:47.988
WAIT A SECOND.

14:48.021 --> 14:49.322
THIS IS WAY TOO
MANY LETTERS, MAN.

14:49.356 --> 14:51.358
ARE YOU SURE?
[phone chimes]

14:57.965 --> 14:59.899
HUH.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.436
YEAH.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.638
DADDY LIKES.

15:05.672 --> 15:08.441
HUH?
HUH?

15:08.475 --> 15:09.442
[rattling]

15:09.476 --> 15:11.178
OH, NO.

15:11.211 --> 15:14.181
OH, NO.
MY HIPPO WAS THE HUNGRIEST.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.615
LET'S PLAY AGAIN.
LET'S PLAY AGAIN.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.985
YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY THINK
I'M GONNA TAKE OFF, MAN.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.419
WHAT?
NO, BUT, I LOVE YOU.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.321
[chuckles]
NO.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.423
AND THAT IS WHY
MY BROTHER HAS NO HAIR

15:23.456 --> 15:24.524
ON THE LEFT SIDE
OF HIS BODY.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.193
THAT IS THE MOST
AMAZING STORY

15:26.226 --> 15:27.260
I'VE EVER HEARD
IN MY LIFE.

15:27.294 --> 15:28.028
IT'S CRAZY.
I--

15:28.061 --> 15:29.229
I DON'T--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:29.262 --> 15:31.198
HEY, CLIFF IS ABOUT
TO LEAVE.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.532
WE NEED TO INTRODUCE
HIM TO THIS CHICK

15:32.565 --> 15:35.002
THAT IS CORNERING EVERYBODY
IN ENDLESS CONVERSATIONS.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.303
WHOA.
OH.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.205
AH! YOU CAN'T LEAVE UNTIL

15:38.238 --> 15:40.273
YOU HAVE MET MY FRIEND,
HEATHER.
OH!

15:40.307 --> 15:42.275
YOU HAVE THE BEST STORIES.
HE'S THE BEST LISTENER.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.676
HI. I'M HEATHER.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.146
AH, HI.
I MANAGE A TEETH WHITENING
CLINIC IN CHELSEA.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.514
UH-HUH. RIGHT.
SPARKLE TOOTH CONCEPTS.

15:47.547 --> 15:48.515
(Mindy)
AMY, DANNY HAS SOMETHING

15:48.548 --> 15:49.682
HE'D LIKE TO TELL YOU.

15:49.716 --> 15:52.719
HOW YOU BEEN?

15:52.752 --> 15:54.287
COME ON.
JUST--CAN YOU PLEASE?

15:54.321 --> 15:57.324
FINE. OKAY, SO
I DEFINITELY LIKED YOU,

15:57.357 --> 16:02.162
BUT I GUESS I KEPT IT
GOING ON SO LONG BECAUSE...

16:02.195 --> 16:04.264
[sighs]

16:04.297 --> 16:06.333
MAYBE I WAS
A LITTLE LONELY.

16:06.366 --> 16:07.634
HE WAS LONELY...

16:07.667 --> 16:10.070
THANK YOU
FOR SAYING THAT, DANNY.

16:10.103 --> 16:11.171
YOU'RE WELCOME.

16:11.204 --> 16:13.273
ACTUALLY,
I REALIZE THAT

16:13.306 --> 16:15.442
SHE HAS A LOT MORE TO BE
ANGRY ABOUT THAN I DO.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.476
I DO.

16:17.777 --> 16:21.181
[inhales sharply]

16:21.214 --> 16:22.382
I'M SO SORRY, ANGEL.

16:22.415 --> 16:23.750
APOLOGIZE TO OUR BABY.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.552
I'M SORRY, BABY.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.154
TELL IT TO HIM.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.389
I'M SO--
I'M SO SORRY, BUDDY.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.058
SO WE HAVE A LOT
THAT WE NEED TO WORK ON.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.725
I WILL SAY THAT
I AM HAPPY YOU CAME BY.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.027
IT WAS PAINFUL, FOR SURE,

16:34.061 --> 16:35.295
BUT ULTIMATELY,
I THINK IT WAS WORTH IT.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.164
IT WAS VERY PAINFUL,
BUT IT WAS GOOD AND--
SO WE'RE GONNA...

16:37.197 --> 16:38.231
(Mindy)
CALL IT A NIGHT.

16:38.265 --> 16:39.266
YEAH, LET'S
CALL IT A NIGHT.

16:39.299 --> 16:40.367
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE'LL
GET A BITE TO EAT SOMETIME.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.269
YOU KNOW, ME, YOU, AND MINDY,
WE'LL JUST DO OUR THING.

16:42.302 --> 16:43.270
WHO--WHO'S MINDY?

16:43.303 --> 16:44.104
HER.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.507
CHLOE.
I'M--MY NAME IS CHLOE, DANNY.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.741
MINDY'S
SOMEONE HE WORKS WITH.

16:48.775 --> 16:49.609
YEAH. CHLOE.
CHLOE.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.211
WE GET CONFUSED
ALL THE TIME, SO...

16:51.244 --> 16:52.212
CHLOE, MINDY...
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

16:52.245 --> 16:53.180
WHAT? WHAT?
NOTHING. NOTHING.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.281
WE'RE JUST A COUPLE
IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.283
ARE YOU IN A RELATIONSHIP
WITH EACH OTHER OR NOT?

16:56.316 --> 16:58.151
OF COURSE.
YES!

16:58.185 --> 16:59.286
(Mindy)
LOOK AT--OF COURSE.

16:59.319 --> 17:02.155
THIS IS WHAT...

17:02.189 --> 17:04.791
YES.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.293
YEAH.

17:08.495 --> 17:10.597
YEAH.

17:12.299 --> 17:15.302
OH YEAH.
OKAY, THIS IS REAL.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.536
DANNY NEVER LOOKED
AT ME LIKE THAT.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.705
PLUS, YOU ARE CLEARLY
VERY PREGNANT.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.640
SO...

17:20.673 --> 17:23.042
YOU'RE A LUCKY WOMAN,
CHLOE SILVERADO.

17:23.843 --> 17:25.278
I DON'T KNOW
IF VERY PREGNANT

17:25.312 --> 17:26.513
IS HOW I WOULD
DESCRIBE ME, BUT OKAY.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.115
YEAH. ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GO.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.549
IT'S JUST WEIRD,
BECAUSE YOU'RE AN ATTORNEY,

17:29.582 --> 17:30.550
I'M A TEETH WHITENER...

17:30.583 --> 17:31.818
RIGHT.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.820
WE'RE BOTH JUST SEARCHING
FOR WHAT'S UNDERNEATH

17:33.853 --> 17:36.423
THE FILM OF LIES OR...

17:36.456 --> 17:38.325
WHY DON'T YOU KEEP TALKING,
AND THEN I'LL CATCH UP,

17:38.358 --> 17:41.094
AND WE'LL, UH, BE GOOD.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.462
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

17:42.495 --> 17:43.630
THANK YOU, CLIFF.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.367
MINDY?
IT'S CLIFF.

17:47.400 --> 17:51.171
LISTEN, I JUST WANT TO SAY
THAT I APOLOGIZE

17:51.204 --> 17:54.341
IF OUR TEXTING THING
GOT A LITTLE INTENSE

17:54.374 --> 17:56.209
AND YOU GOT SCARED OFF.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.345
YOU KNOW, BUT LOOK--

17:58.378 --> 18:01.214
NOW THAT I'M HERE, I REALLY--
I JUST, I DON'T KNOW--

18:01.248 --> 18:03.450
I JUST WANT TO GET TO KNOW
YOU BETTER.

18:03.483 --> 18:06.619
I THINK YOU'RE REALLY
COOL AND, YOU KNOW,

18:06.653 --> 18:08.555
THE MOST EXCITING TEXT
I GOT FROM YOU ALL NIGHT

18:08.588 --> 18:12.459
WAS THE FIRST ONE.

18:14.161 --> 18:17.264
MINDY?

18:17.297 --> 18:18.498
MINDY?

18:18.531 --> 18:19.799
OH...

18:23.870 --> 18:24.771
DID YOU GUYS KILL HER?
DID YOU KILL HER?

18:24.804 --> 18:26.373
IS SHE DEAD
BECAUSE OF YOU?

18:26.406 --> 18:28.141
OH, GOD. IT'S HAPPENING.
IT'S HAPPENING.

18:28.175 --> 18:30.610
IF I WANTED TO KILL MINDY,
I WOULDN'T DO IT MYSELF.

18:30.643 --> 18:31.911
HIT MAN, BRO.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.580
YEAH, HE'D CALL SOMEONE
LIKE ME AND I WOULD DO IT.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.415
THAT'S EXACTLY HOW
I ENVISION IT GOING DOWN.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.150
THAT'S NOT WHAT'S
HAPPENING HERE THOUGH.

18:37.184 --> 18:38.385
DID SHE SEND ME
THOSE TEXTS OR NOT?

18:38.418 --> 18:39.652
WE DID.
[sighs]

18:39.686 --> 18:41.421
(Morgan)
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO KNOW
OH, MY GOD.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.890
THAT EVEN THOUGH WE WERE
SEDUCING YOU FOR OUR COWORKER,

18:43.923 --> 18:46.526
I'D BE LYING IF I SAID I WASN'T
A LITTLE TURNED ON MYSELF.

18:46.559 --> 18:49.696
ME TOO, IF THAT
WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

18:49.729 --> 18:50.930
IT WON'T, OKAY?

18:50.963 --> 18:53.166
IT TRULY AND PROFOUNDLY
WILL NOT.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.934
OKAY.
YEP, I CAN SEE
HOW IT WOULDN'T

18:54.967 --> 18:56.068
SO HERE'S WHAT I NEED
YOU GUYS TO DO.

18:56.102 --> 18:58.805
I NEED YOU TO DELETE THOSE
TEXTS BEFORE MINDY SEES THEM.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.373
OR YOU'LL SUE US.

19:00.407 --> 19:01.641
OR I WILL KILL YOU.

19:04.244 --> 19:07.247
I GIVE THIS
PARTY A "C."

19:09.249 --> 19:10.883
OH, THERE YOU ARE.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.419
OH, HEY.
WHAT'S UP?

19:12.452 --> 19:13.953
HEY, I THINK I TALKED
TO EVERYONE AT THE PARTY,

19:13.986 --> 19:16.289
SO I WAS GONNA GO.

19:17.524 --> 19:18.891
DO YOU WANT
TO COME BACK TO MY PLACE?

19:18.925 --> 19:20.760
I'M SORRY--WHA--
WAIT, WHAT?

19:20.793 --> 19:23.796
UM, I JUST THINK
YOU'RE CUTE

19:23.830 --> 19:28.801
AND NICE, SO WHY NOT
CUT TO THE CHASE?

19:28.835 --> 19:31.738
YOU KNOW, I HAVE HAD
A VERY FRUSTRATING EVENING,

19:31.771 --> 19:34.841
SO THAT SOUNDS
PRETTY GOOD.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.376
OKAY.

19:37.910 --> 19:41.648
[sighs]
WELL, THAT COULD
HAVE GONE WORSE, HUH?

19:41.681 --> 19:43.283
JUST DELETE THOSE TEXTS.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.717
MINDY WON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.319
ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.654
I'M GONNA GO CLEAN UP.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.525
(Mindy)
YOU KNOW, DANNY, AT THIS POINT,

19:52.559 --> 19:53.726
IF YOU AND I
POOLED OUR MONEY TOGETHER,

19:53.760 --> 19:54.961
WE COULD BUY GREECE.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.731
I'D HAVE TO SHARE GREECE
WITH YOU THOUGH.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.967
EH, WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.969
YOU KNOW THAT GUY
YOU WERE TELLING ME ABOUT?

20:03.002 --> 20:04.203
THE ONE YOU WORK WITH.

20:05.505 --> 20:08.408
I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW,
HE'S NOT OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE.

20:08.441 --> 20:09.642
YOU'RE GREAT.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.278
THAT'S VERY NICE
OF YOU TO SAY.

20:11.311 --> 20:14.914
I MEAN IT.

20:14.947 --> 20:17.350
HEY.

20:17.384 --> 20:18.985
I LOVE THAT YOU SAID THAT.

20:19.018 --> 20:20.653
AND I'M GONNA DO IT.

20:20.687 --> 20:24.491
WHEN I GET HOME, I'M GONNA
CALL CLIFF AND ASK HIM OUT.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.259
WAIT, WHAT?

20:26.293 --> 20:28.828
CLIFF GILBERT.
YOUR FRIEND, THE ATTORNEY.

20:30.763 --> 20:33.333
WAIT, WHO DID YOU THINK
I WAS TALKING ABOUT?

20:33.366 --> 20:36.569
CLIFF GILBERT,
FROM--FROM DOWN THE HALL.

20:36.603 --> 20:37.604
HE'S LIKE, 50?

20:37.637 --> 20:39.406
NO, I THINK
HE'S YOUNGER THAN YOU.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.574
OH, HE IS?
HIS EYES ARE KIND OF--

20:41.608 --> 20:42.842
THEY'RE CLOSE TOGETHER,
AREN'T THEY?

20:42.875 --> 20:45.345
HIS BEAUTIFUL,
PERFECT BLUE EYES?

20:45.378 --> 20:46.346
I DON'T THINK SO.

20:46.379 --> 20:48.014
CLIFF GILBERT.

20:48.047 --> 20:49.949
HOW ABOUT THAT?

20:49.982 --> 20:51.951
[sighs]

20:54.921 --> 20:57.524
PURSE, YOU'RE HERE!

21:04.497 --> 21:05.798
(Heather)
HI, MINDY, IT'S HEATHER.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.734
GREAT PARTY.
I WISH WE'D GOTTEN TO CHAT MORE.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.001
YOU LOOKED SO PRETTY.

21:09.035 --> 21:12.539
I JUST WANTED TO UPDATE YOU--
CLIFF AND I HUNG OUT LAST NIGHT

21:12.572 --> 21:14.441
AND ONE THING
LED TO ANOTHER...

21:14.474 --> 21:16.876
WELL, IT IS PRETTY EXCITING.

21:16.909 --> 21:18.978
AND I OWE IT ALL TO YOU.
OKAY, BYE.

21:19.011 --> 21:21.047
WHAT THE HELL?

21:21.080 --> 21:23.282
[phone chiming]

21:31.358 --> 21:33.360
GO TO BED.
