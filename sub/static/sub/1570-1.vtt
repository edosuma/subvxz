00:30.290 --> 00:34.660
TEENAGE BOY:
Drink it up, virgins! (laughs)

00:34.694 --> 00:37.029
(coughs)
(pants) How you doing over there, bud?

00:37.063 --> 00:39.498
I was thinking, um,
if the school switched

00:39.533 --> 00:43.002
to waterless urinals, they
could save over 35 gallons

00:43.036 --> 00:45.304
every time these
guys swirlied us.

00:46.473 --> 00:48.507
Yup, those numbers check out.

00:50.010 --> 00:51.810
Wait, Vince, hold up, hold up.

00:51.845 --> 00:55.247
Let's see how virginy
these guys <i>really</i> are.

00:55.282 --> 00:56.949
Have you even touched a boob?

00:56.983 --> 00:58.851
Yeah! I was breast-fed.

00:58.885 --> 01:00.653
Nice! What about you?

01:00.687 --> 01:02.354
I was a formula baby.

01:02.389 --> 01:04.089
My mom's an alcoholic.

01:04.123 --> 01:06.158
Wrong answer!

01:06.192 --> 01:07.560
(coughs)

01:07.594 --> 01:09.028
Next question.

01:09.062 --> 01:12.097
Have either of you ever
gazed into the eyes

01:12.132 --> 01:15.234
of your lover as the
world falls away,

01:15.268 --> 01:18.304
and you realize you're
no longer two people

01:18.338 --> 01:20.839
but one soul united?

01:21.841 --> 01:24.076
Um...
Um...

01:24.110 --> 01:26.579
Gay!
Gay!

01:26.613 --> 01:28.614
(coughing)
(coughing)

01:34.487 --> 01:35.955
Man, we're pathetic!

01:35.989 --> 01:38.424
We got to find
a way to have sex.

01:38.458 --> 01:40.759
And not just for them,
for us, too!

01:40.794 --> 01:43.596
It's not like we haven't tried.

01:43.630 --> 01:45.297
Great. No paper towels.

01:45.332 --> 01:47.666
This day is a <i>beast.</i>

01:50.470 --> 01:52.705
That's it! Prom!

01:52.739 --> 01:54.340
Prom is when girls are
socially conditioned

01:54.374 --> 01:55.874
to put out the most.

01:55.909 --> 01:58.510
Yes, assuming you can
get them to go with you.

01:58.545 --> 02:00.546
How are we gonna get dates?

02:00.580 --> 02:03.649
I don't know. Who-who are guys
that get lots of girls?

02:03.683 --> 02:05.551
Celebrities?
You're right.

02:05.585 --> 02:07.052
We need new head shots.

02:07.087 --> 02:09.288
Dude, our head shots
almost got us

02:09.322 --> 02:11.290
the OshKosh B'gosh campaign.

02:11.324 --> 02:13.192
I'm keeping 'em.

02:15.729 --> 02:18.030
So, in summary,
we're hoping you can tell us

02:18.064 --> 02:19.798
how we can land
two willing ladies

02:19.833 --> 02:21.567
to go to the prom with us.

02:21.601 --> 02:23.435
Now, they don't
have to be smart,

02:23.470 --> 02:25.704
their breasts don't need
to be prizewinners,

02:25.739 --> 02:27.640
but we should know
they're there,

02:27.674 --> 02:28.974
and their asses should...

02:29.009 --> 02:29.975
Stop!

02:30.010 --> 02:31.377
You guys are pigs.

02:31.411 --> 02:33.646
You can't objectify
women like this.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.347
These girls
you're talking about,

02:35.382 --> 02:37.483
they're someone's sister,
someone's daughter.

02:37.517 --> 02:39.885
I-If, if you'll just let
me finish my sentence.

02:39.919 --> 02:43.122
Asses. We'd prefer slightly
too large or boyish.

02:43.156 --> 02:45.157
But this is low-priority.

02:45.191 --> 02:46.552
Look, I'd love
to stay and tell you

02:46.559 --> 02:49.361
how disgusting you are,
but I got to go dump out

02:49.396 --> 02:52.331
to make room for this
hot and cheesy hoagie.

02:53.633 --> 02:55.167
(squawking)

02:57.971 --> 02:59.505
W-Was that
a dodo?

02:59.539 --> 03:01.040
I thought they were extinct.

03:01.074 --> 03:03.308
Nope. Thanks to the
cloning machine at work,

03:03.343 --> 03:05.778
the only thing that's
extinct-- dot, dot, dot--

03:05.812 --> 03:07.446
is extinction.

03:07.480 --> 03:08.580
Come here, you.

03:08.615 --> 03:10.716
It's my week
to take care of Darren.

03:10.750 --> 03:12.017
(kissing)

03:12.052 --> 03:13.485
I wuv you, Dawwen!

03:13.520 --> 03:16.021
Is my little dodo hungry?

03:17.257 --> 03:19.558
(happy grunting)

03:23.396 --> 03:26.165
Ah, the dodo--
<i>Raphus cucullatus.</i>

03:26.199 --> 03:28.600
These magnificent creatures
would still be around today

03:28.635 --> 03:30.502
if not
for the bloodthirsty Dutch

03:30.537 --> 03:33.205
hunting them
to extinction in 1662.

03:33.239 --> 03:35.507
(squawks)
The very same year the world lost

03:35.542 --> 03:38.043
French poet François
le Métel de Boisrobert.

03:38.078 --> 03:40.212
Nobody cares about
your stuff, Francine.

03:42.048 --> 03:43.048
(squawks)

03:44.084 --> 03:45.284
Oh, no, you don't.

03:45.318 --> 03:46.852
Can't let this guy get out.

03:46.886 --> 03:49.388
If the world discovered
the CIA was cloning things,

03:49.422 --> 03:51.390
they'd shut us down
for playing God.

03:51.424 --> 03:52.891
You know who else played God?

03:52.926 --> 03:55.427
George Burns.
And he's dead!

03:59.966 --> 04:02.768
So, we might not know girls,
but we do know math,

04:02.802 --> 04:04.803
and if we ask
every girl in school,

04:04.838 --> 04:08.107
odds are two of 'em are bound
to go to prom with us.

04:08.141 --> 04:10.676
Sorry, not interested.

04:10.710 --> 04:11.677
I don't think so.

04:11.711 --> 04:13.278
In your dreams, nerd!

04:13.313 --> 04:14.346
What...
about...

04:14.380 --> 04:15.147
no...
don't...

04:15.181 --> 04:17.483
you...
understand?

04:19.986 --> 04:21.620
Hey, fellas.
Hi, guys.

04:21.654 --> 04:22.621
Steven.

04:22.655 --> 04:23.822
(speaks Hebrew)

04:23.857 --> 04:25.858
So, since none of us
have dates for the prom,

04:25.892 --> 04:28.427
Snot and I were thinking the
four of us could all hang out.

04:28.461 --> 04:30.329
No girls, no distractions,

04:30.363 --> 04:33.866
just another
hard-core BF weekend!

04:33.900 --> 04:37.035
Sounds great, but Toshi
and I already have dates.

04:37.070 --> 04:37.803

Isn't Darren a boy bird?

05:14.707 --> 05:17.309

can't tell on us.

05:17.343 --> 05:18.710
What? No.

05:18.745 --> 05:21.847
W... We use the cloning
machine at my dad's work

05:21.881 --> 05:24.149
to make prom dates.
Really?

05:24.184 --> 05:26.985
Yeah, man. We find two
of the hottest girls around,

05:27.020 --> 05:29.388
we get their DNA, we clone 'em,

05:29.422 --> 05:32.057
and we bone 'em!
Totally on board.

05:32.091 --> 05:35.661

DNA for our T-n-A?

Field day!

05:57.217 --> 05:58.517

05:58.551 --> 06:00.185
All we need is
another one and...

06:00.220 --> 06:01.887
What are you two
doing in here?!

06:01.921 --> 06:03.856
I know it looks bad--
two teenage boys

06:03.890 --> 06:06.325
in a girls' dressing room--
but I can assure you

06:06.359 --> 06:08.861
we are only here
to collect pubic hair.

06:11.264 --> 06:14.566
Darn! We only got
one DNA sample!

06:14.601 --> 06:16.268
And stay out, perverts!

06:16.302 --> 06:17.569
(hawks, spits)

06:35.421 --> 06:38.290
Okay, we got six hours
to find the cloning machine.

06:38.324 --> 06:41.126
I brought trail mix and water in
case it takes us all night to...

06:41.160 --> 06:42.394
Found it!

06:42.428 --> 06:44.096
Good thing I brought
this trash can

06:44.130 --> 06:47.666
in case we found it right away.

Wait!

06:58.778 --> 07:01.146
(high-pitched whirring)

07:02.715 --> 07:04.750
What are you gonna name yours?

07:04.784 --> 07:07.686
I want mine to have
a sexy stripper name,

07:07.720 --> 07:09.087
like Honey.

07:09.122 --> 07:11.423
I'm gonna name mine after
my great-grandmother,

07:11.457 --> 07:12.658
Glitter.

07:12.692 --> 07:16.461
Naming your sex clone
after your great-grandmother.

07:16.496 --> 07:19.031
That's a nice way to honor her.

07:19.065 --> 07:21.233
(whirring)
Here we go.

07:21.267 --> 07:23.402

They're finally asleep.

07:39.192 --> 07:40.692
Man...

07:40.726 --> 07:41.851
this backfired.

07:42.091 --> 07:45.193
I know. In every cloning movie,
they come out fully grown.

07:45.228 --> 07:47.095
This isn't a movie, Steve!

07:47.130 --> 07:49.431
This is real life!

07:49.465 --> 07:53.135
We waltzed into the
CIA to clone dates

07:53.169 --> 07:55.237
from pubic hair and spit,

07:55.271 --> 07:57.672
and now we're totally
screwed for prom!

07:57.707 --> 08:00.342
Forget prom! What, what are we
gonna do about these babies?

08:00.376 --> 08:02.477
We got to get to school!

08:04.547 --> 08:07.015
"Rainbow Unicorn
Gardens Day Care."

08:07.050 --> 08:08.216
Where is it?

08:08.251 --> 08:10.218
(music box playing lullaby)

08:10.253 --> 08:12.287
Oh, you must be
the new applicants.

08:12.321 --> 08:14.122
Hi. I'm Skyler Montessori,

08:14.157 --> 08:16.558
founder of Rainbow
Unicorn Gardens.

08:16.592 --> 08:18.560
We are an elite,
exclusive day care,

08:18.594 --> 08:20.462
but we strive for diversity.

08:20.496 --> 08:22.464
This one's dirt-poor.

08:22.498 --> 08:23.598
It's fun.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.434
So, can we just drop them off

08:25.468 --> 08:27.035
and pick them up after school?

08:27.070 --> 08:29.037
Oh, no, no, no, no,
not so fast.

08:29.072 --> 08:30.839
We don't take just any children.

08:30.873 --> 08:32.908
There's a rigorous
application process.

08:32.942 --> 08:34.409
We don't have time for this.

08:34.443 --> 08:36.445
We'll find someplace else.

08:37.480 --> 08:38.580
Wait.

08:38.614 --> 08:40.414
Your baby doesn't
have a belly button.

08:40.450 --> 08:41.616
That's, um...

08:41.650 --> 08:43.618
because they're clones.

08:43.653 --> 08:44.920
Clones?

08:44.954 --> 08:46.655
Well, hmm...

08:46.689 --> 08:48.523
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

08:48.558 --> 08:51.626
Stacey over at the Sunshine
Shack doesn't have any clones.

08:51.661 --> 08:53.995
I'll take 'em!
Thank God!

08:55.598 --> 08:57.232
(sputtering nearby)

08:57.266 --> 09:00.335
No! Damien, we
do not eat glue!

09:00.369 --> 09:02.437
The glue is not for eating!

09:04.507 --> 09:06.108
(inhales)

09:08.177 --> 09:10.812
(giggling)

09:10.847 --> 09:12.147
You guys...

09:12.181 --> 09:14.983
you guys are like...
little people.

09:16.652 --> 09:18.620
(bell rings)

09:21.457 --> 09:23.125
I never thought I'd say this,

09:23.159 --> 09:25.127
but crap, school's over.

09:25.161 --> 09:27.596
I know. Is there
anything we can do

09:27.630 --> 09:30.365
to avoid going home
to those babies?

09:30.399 --> 09:32.834
Maybe. Watch this.

09:32.869 --> 09:35.504
Hey, Miss Lane,
Snot and I were just giggling

09:35.538 --> 09:37.706
and talking about
how your ass is disgusting.

09:37.740 --> 09:39.207
Is that the kind of thing

09:39.242 --> 09:41.109
that would land two boys
in detention?

09:41.144 --> 09:43.678
Steve, Snot, detention...

09:43.713 --> 09:47.115
is for boys who
don't tell the truth.

09:53.923 --> 09:55.690
(both sigh)

09:58.227 --> 09:59.628
Oh, there you are!

09:59.662 --> 10:01.630
And only two hours late!

10:01.664 --> 10:04.266
Oh, it's okay, though.
I can always get the next bus.

10:04.300 --> 10:06.601
It's fine. Yeah, it's fine
that I spend my days

10:06.636 --> 10:08.003
taking care
of other people's kids

10:10.506 --> 10:12.474

the only late ones.

10:14.510 --> 10:16.044
What about
those girls' parents?

10:16.078 --> 10:18.513
Actually, those are <i>your</i> girls.
What?!

10:18.548 --> 10:20.482
Yep, they did
a lot of growing today.

10:20.516 --> 10:22.717
When they got here
they couldn't even sit up,

10:22.752 --> 10:26.388
and now I taught them
to-- girls, do it!

10:26.422 --> 10:29.424
They can do...
whatever that's called.

10:29.458 --> 10:31.426
How is this possible?

10:31.460 --> 10:34.095
They must be... five
years old by now.

10:34.130 --> 10:36.097

10:36.132 --> 10:38.233

they're growing,

10:38.267 --> 10:41.002
they're gonna be the right age
for prom by Saturday!

10:41.037 --> 10:43.104
Cool! We can just
leave 'em here!

10:43.139 --> 10:45.307
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, sirs,
this is a day care.

10:45.341 --> 10:46.875

pleased to meet you.

And remember, those books
are for posture only.
