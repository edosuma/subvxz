00:01.293 --> 00:02.658
CARTER: It wasjust
a normal day in Eureka.

00:02.794 --> 00:03.829
Day's not over yet.

00:04.213 --> 00:05.953
Yeah, like that was
going to last.

00:06.298 --> 00:09.586
Hello, 1947.
Confused? Let me clarify.

00:09.801 --> 00:11.132
The five of us got
transported back in time

00:11.261 --> 00:13.673
through some wormhole thingy
thanks to the Bridge Device.

00:13.805 --> 00:15.011
We eventually found
our way back home,

00:15.140 --> 00:17.552
but surprise, home wasn't
exactly the way we left it.

00:17.684 --> 00:19.549
Zane and Jo? Never dated.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.062
But Jo's in charge
of G.D. Security.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.600
And Fargo?
Head of Global Dynamics.

00:23.732 --> 00:26.223
Oh, and Dr. Old Spice
hitched a ride with us
back to the present,

00:26.360 --> 00:28.567
but there's one crappy rule.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.196
We can't tell anyone.

00:30.656 --> 00:33.693
If people ever found out
about our trip,
there'd be trouble.

00:33.825 --> 00:34.780
Just for luck.

00:34.910 --> 00:37.743
And I finally kissed Allison
back in the past.

00:38.956 --> 00:39.945
Which brings us
to the present.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.913
CARTER: l'm head over heels
in love with you

00:42.042 --> 00:44.158
and l have been
since the day we met.

00:44.878 --> 00:45.833
You want to grab
some dinner?

00:46.046 --> 00:47.411
l was thinking...

00:47.714 --> 00:48.703
Maybe breakfast?

00:49.341 --> 00:51.878
l have been
romanticizing
our relationship.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.418
What are you talking...
I'm over it. I'm done.

00:54.555 --> 00:55.635
Why do you have
my grandmother's ring?

00:55.764 --> 00:56.799
What's going on?

00:56.932 --> 00:57.796
BEVERLY: This is
a chance for you

00:57.933 --> 01:00.140
to do what you
intended to do
years ago.

01:00.269 --> 01:01.349
Who are you?

01:01.520 --> 01:02.930
I believe you knew my father,

01:03.397 --> 01:04.386
Adam Barlowe.

01:04.648 --> 01:07.435
You were the architects
of a powerful movement.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.399
I've taken up
my father's cause.

01:09.528 --> 01:10.984
And now there are
thousands of us.

01:11.113 --> 01:13.946
We're the watchdogs
working to control
scientific developments.

01:14.283 --> 01:16.649
This is our latest concern.

01:16.827 --> 01:19.113
GRANT: DED?
It's a weapon of domination.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.736
A plan is already in motion.

01:20.872 --> 01:22.373
And everyone
has a part to play.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.827
Zane, I'm going
to have to take
you in for questioning.

01:24.960 --> 01:25.949
For what?

01:26.086 --> 01:29.078
Potential collusion in the
theft of the DED.

01:50.944 --> 01:51.933
GRANT: You're late, Adam.

01:52.070 --> 01:53.935
Sorry, Doc. I got stuck
unloading fireworks

01:54.072 --> 01:55.858
at the motor pool.

01:56.366 --> 01:57.867
I've got to play
my role, don't I?

02:01.622 --> 02:04.284
Yeah, well with any luck,
you won't need to play it
for much longer.

02:04.416 --> 02:05.826
COOK: Hey, Frank,
put the Dodger game on.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.495
I hate them
leaving you behind.

02:07.628 --> 02:08.617
FRANK: Yeah, yeah.

02:09.254 --> 02:11.791
Listen, scientific
discovery starts
with bold ideas.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.003
We need to ensure
that Eureka doesn't

02:13.133 --> 02:16.296
become just another
brain trust for building
deadlier weapons.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.629
Don't worry, Doc.

02:20.932 --> 02:22.593
I'm not going
to let you down.

02:22.726 --> 02:24.933
Hey, boys.
Taking bets
on the game?

02:25.937 --> 02:28.804
The critics
think Robinson
is a publicity stunt.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.805
They may be right.
You always were
a cynic.

02:30.942 --> 02:32.933

of dreamers
needs one.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.810
Lily Morgan,

02:35.614 --> 02:37.730
Lily's our girl
at the Rad Lab
in Berkeley.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.447
She helped crack
the anti—conversion formula

02:39.576 --> 02:42.283
for the Bridge Device. So
she's not just a pretty face.

02:42.412 --> 02:43.822
She's a wizard

02:52.089 --> 02:53.169

02:54.424 --> 02:55.880

04:59.049 --> 05:00.038
Okay.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.801
Any progress
on the search?

05:01.927 --> 05:03.337
Nope. Still pretty
much screwed.

05:14.815 --> 05:15.804
Actually,
they found nothing.

ofalead.

05:17.943 --> 05:18.853
Not in this case.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.146
I've been scanning
radiation all around town

05:21.279 --> 05:23.565
in order to detect
the DED device.

05:23.698 --> 05:26.735
Here, there's
no radiation at all.

05:28.912 --> 05:29.947
And?

05:30.080 --> 05:32.617

about the old Zane...

05:54.855 --> 05:58.473

that we used to be together

05:58.608 --> 06:01.600
and then I threw
his grandmother's

06:22.132 --> 06:23.121
How did you...

06:23.758 --> 06:26.465
My father took the blueprints
after you disappeared

06:26.595 --> 06:28.927
from the base with a group
of suspected spies.

06:29.431 --> 06:30.796
They weren't spies.

06:30.932 --> 06:32.923
No. They were from
the future.

my father's life
used a technique

06:38.148 --> 06:40.230

traveled back with them.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.572
| just can't believe
you rebuilt it.

06:49.701 --> 06:52.443
We made a few improvements
to the original design.

06:52.579 --> 06:55.571
That's why we needed
the plasma cell
from the DED weapon.

fixed point in time.

We can send you back
to that very same moment.

I want to go back.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.762

to leave all this behind?

07:13.558 --> 07:15.719
I know about
your passion.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.260
How you formed
this consortium
of scientists

07:18.396 --> 07:20.773
who wanted
to protect us
from ourselves.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.890

to restore your legacy.

could accomplish

07:35.830 --> 07:37.912
of the past 63 years

07:38.917 --> 07:41.033
Einstein was a visionary.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.080
You'll be a god.

But your crazy can wait.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.271
What would Dr. Grant
have to gain by being
involved in this?

08:11.408 --> 08:13.990
All I know is
the guy's G.D. profile
looked doctored to me.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.779
And he was alone
in that control room

08:15.912 --> 08:18.745
when that containment
field around the DED
weapon failed.

08:18.873 --> 08:21.740
Come on, someone must have
hacked my personnel file
and stolen my pass code.

08:21.876 --> 08:22.865
Um, uh...

08:23.253 --> 08:24.163

to burst into flames.

SARAH, l have taken steps
to be more cautious.

08:34.305 --> 08:35.590
She's one heck of a house.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.840

08:41.646 --> 08:42.977
I'm afraid
he's not answering.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.185
We're going to have
to find out who else
Grant knows.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.855
Given his unique circumstance
of past employment in Eureka,

08:49.988 --> 08:52.400
Dr. Grant's file would be
stored in G.D. archives.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.817
Well, then let's get
some history

08:53.950 --> 08:54.860
on our town historian.

08:54.993 --> 08:56.608
Uh, Andy,
watch him.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.868
Hey, Lupo,
when this is all over

09:00.123 --> 09:01.704
we're going to
talk about that ring.

09:05.128 --> 09:06.413
JO: Keep an eye on him, Andy.

09:13.887 --> 09:14.876
What?

09:22.145 --> 09:23.260
Getting any readings?

09:23.438 --> 09:25.269
No, but you know
what's more unsettling?

09:25.815 --> 09:26.804
What?

09:27.067 --> 09:28.932
I don't remember
this gorge being
here before.

09:31.446 --> 09:33.402
I'm not getting a signal.
What about you?

09:34.616 --> 09:36.231
No, nothing.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.363

causing interference.

investigation into
Grant's disappearance

09:46.628 --> 09:50.837
in 1947. I had
the sealed files moved from
the archives to my office.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.171
Nice work.
Yeah.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.006
So, uh, what are
you going to tell Zane?

09:54.135 --> 09:56.342
(SIGHS)
I don't know yet.

09:56.471 --> 09:58.803
And what's going on
with you and Allison?
Don't deny it.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.172
I will taze you.

10:00.308 --> 10:02.048
Yeah, we took
the plunge.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.263

Seriously.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.928

took you four years.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.698
JO: All Grant's
classified files.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.412
CARTER: Look for any
names or contacts.

10:35.593 --> 10:36.582
What is this?

10:37.262 --> 10:38.251
Uh, recording wire.

10:38.513 --> 10:41.596
The military used
to use it for dictation
before magnetic tape.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.092

has to say for himself.

Subject in custody
identified himself

10:52.152 --> 10:54.359
as one Jack Carter,
town sheriff.

10:54.863 --> 10:57.024
He's of average height,
weight, intellect.

10:57.824 --> 11:00.486

He's a bit thick—headed
to be quite honest.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.825
In 1947,

11:06.958 --> 11:09.745
Yes, you are
very big and smart.

11:11.254 --> 11:15.213
The army did make an arrest.
A Private Adam Barlowe.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.123
Barlowe?

11:17.886 --> 11:21.595
Uh, yeah. Served 15 years
for stealing classified
plans from Einstein's lab.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.304
Barlowe was released.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.808
Uh, got married.
Moved to Berkeley.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.017
Carter, he had a daughter.

11:31.399 --> 11:32.809
Beverly.
Yeah.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.809
Jo, if she's back...

11:36.154 --> 11:38.691
And she took the DED
device, Carter it...

11:38.823 --> 11:42.441
Yeah, Henry and Allison
are walking into a trap.
Come on, Allison, pick up.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.405
Still no signal.
I can't get a hold of Jack.

11:45.747 --> 11:48.830

So it's Jack now, huh?
This is serious.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.661
Stop it.
No, no. Let me tell you.

11:50.793 --> 11:53.535
I've known for a while now
that the two of you
were meant for each other.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.253
I kind of did, too.
Uh—huh.

We should go out
and celebrate.

40:19.334 --> 40:20.323
Jo, do you want
to come?

40:20.460 --> 40:23.827
No, no, no, no, no.
You two go ahead.
I'll see you tomorrow.

40:40.396 --> 40:42.682
CARTER: Find any mementos
from the past?

40:45.276 --> 40:46.686
A few things.

40:49.697 --> 40:50.948
Got your papen/vork.

40:51.908 --> 40:53.489
It's a
standard redaction.

40:53.701 --> 40:55.817
Everything you're gonna
need to start your new life
someplace else.

40:57.664 --> 40:59.996
And judging from
the credentials
Fargo gave you,

41:01.668 --> 41:03.158
you're going to be able
to write your own ticket.

41:03.336 --> 41:07.124
I don't know what to say.
I appreciate that, I do,

41:08.216 --> 41:10.753
but I'm not sure
a newjob is going to
be strictly necessary.

41:15.682 --> 41:16.671
Johnson & Johnson?

41:16.975 --> 41:18.886
Yeah, an old friend
told me to invest
a while back.

41:19.018 --> 41:21.009
Only this time around
I chose to listen to her.

41:21.562 --> 41:23.553
A thousand shares
from 1947.

41:23.690 --> 41:28.104
Yeah, what with six decades
of stock splits and interest,
I'm what you might call

41:29.654 --> 41:30.643
rolling in it.

41:31.572 --> 41:32.652
(CHUCKLES)

41:34.492 --> 41:35.652
Where are you
going to go?

41:36.285 --> 41:41.029
Well, I always did want
to travel. And now, I can
do it first class.

41:45.670 --> 41:47.661
I think that's everything.

41:50.675 --> 41:53.667
(STAMMERS)
I just wanted
to say thanks

41:55.471 --> 41:56.881
for helping me save her.

41:58.474 --> 41:59.850
I mean,
I don't know...

42:01.769 --> 42:02.929
Um,

42:05.148 --> 42:06.354
thanks.

42:06.482 --> 42:08.643
Please, you don't have
to thank me for that.

42:09.569 --> 42:11.525
After the mess
I got you guys into,
it's the least I could do.

42:11.863 --> 42:12.898
No.

42:13.531 --> 42:17.649
Hey, I'm no good at good—byes,
so tell the others for me.

42:18.369 --> 42:19.449
Sure.

42:20.496 --> 42:22.327
Oh, uh...

42:22.457 --> 42:23.446
(CHUCKLES)

42:23.916 --> 42:25.292
Almost forgot.

42:27.879 --> 42:29.665
From one baseball fan
to another.

42:31.549 --> 42:32.664
I'll be seeing you, sport.

42:35.053 --> 42:36.714
Don't call me sport.

42:44.395 --> 42:45.896
Jackie Robinson?

42:55.448 --> 42:57.655
I'm afraid things
didn't work out
the way we hoped.

43:01.370 --> 43:03.531
But I do have
a new target in mind.

43:04.665 --> 43:05.654
(PHONE BEEPS)
