-Who is my best friend.

08:48.625 --> 08:50.208
'Cause I needed someone
to talk to

08:50.291 --> 08:51.750
after my wife made a cuck-hold
of me.

08:51.834 --> 08:54.792
Okay, "cuck-hold"?
there is no "h" in "cuckold."

08:54.875 --> 08:56.208
You idiot. Right?

08:56.291 --> 08:58.834
Now you're getting another man
to spell "cuckold" for me.

08:58.917 --> 09:00.166
-Mm-hmm.
-DOUG: We had drinks.

09:00.250 --> 09:02.709
We were talking
and I got emotional.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.417
And I accidentally
kissed her neck.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.333
-How do you accidentally kiss
somebody's neck?
-But I didn't have full sex.

09:07.417 --> 09:09.166
Oh, well, when have you
ever done that, Doug?

09:09.250 --> 09:11.667
-Can I just get my own cabin?
-Yes! Please!

09:11.750 --> 09:14.333
If I have to watch him
carefully dry his balls

09:14.417 --> 09:16.083
one more time,
I'm gonna kill myself.

09:16.166 --> 09:18.250
I have a male yeast infection.
It's a real i--

09:18.333 --> 09:19.917
-(SIGHS)
-Would you rather I carelessly

09:20.000 --> 09:21.333
dry my balls?

09:21.417 --> 09:23.709
Okay, this is all
very informative.

09:24.375 --> 09:25.709
Are you taking notes?

09:27.125 --> 09:28.917
-What?
-How long has that
been up there?

09:29.000 --> 09:32.208
Now, the word cloud
is in your room

09:32.291 --> 09:33.333
on all the screens.

09:33.417 --> 09:35.625
-What? Can we get rid of it?
-No.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.166
You can add words to it,
but you can't remove any.

09:38.250 --> 09:41.291
When you get back there,
you're gonna see words like

09:41.375 --> 09:44.125
-"Neck." "Male bitch."
-Mm-hmm.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.083
"The beast of yeast."

09:46.166 --> 09:49.000
You're gonna see words like
"Emotional ragdoll."

09:49.083 --> 09:53.542
"Chunky millstone." "Fucker."
"Worm-dicked little fucker."

09:53.625 --> 09:55.667
Who put that word on there?
We didn't say that word.

09:55.750 --> 09:56.917
-I'd said it.
-When?

09:57.000 --> 09:58.333
Before you got here.

09:58.834 --> 10:00.792
"Stank-ass balls."

10:00.875 --> 10:02.792
Yeah, I said you can shove
your stank-ass balls

10:02.875 --> 10:04.291
in your mouth and choke on them
and die.

10:04.375 --> 10:06.125
How much work did you guys do
before I got here?

10:06.208 --> 10:08.000
She got here 45 minutes early.

10:09.709 --> 10:12.000
I think we did
really good work today.

10:12.083 --> 10:13.458
-Yeah.
-MATT SPENCER:
So, you're at peace?

10:13.542 --> 10:15.750
I'm gonna go fix
some other passengers now.

10:15.834 --> 10:17.583

Faux Capitano in the house!

10:29.500 --> 10:30.583
(ENGLISH ACCENT) Morning.

10:32.500 --> 10:36.000
Sorry it took me so long
to realize that you existed.

10:36.083 --> 10:37.667
No problem.

10:37.750 --> 10:40.917
So, popcorn and dirty jokes.
Who's in?

10:41.000 --> 10:42.250

-So, she said,

10:42.333 --> 10:44.208
"Wait a minute, well, then,
who was that on the ladder?"

10:44.291 --> 10:48.208
-(LAUGHTER)
-(BILLIE LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY)

10:49.792 --> 10:53.041
I want that as a ringtone.
I definitely do!

10:53.125 --> 10:56.834
Wow. Seriously, though,
on a scale of one

10:56.917 --> 11:00.375
to "we're all going to die,"
how fucked did you think

11:00.458 --> 11:02.750
we were when we found out
that I'm just a beard

11:02.834 --> 11:04.792
in a Sergeant Pepper uniform?

11:04.875 --> 11:07.166
Uh, actually, we've been taking
bets on how long you'd last.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.041
Uh, yeah. You owe me 50 bucks.

11:09.125 --> 11:10.417
(LAUGHTER)

11:10.500 --> 11:12.959
I'm-- I'm laughing
because I'm terrified!

11:13.041 --> 11:14.417
(LAUGHTER)

11:14.500 --> 11:17.792
Do you love to drink?
I know my dad did.

11:17.875 --> 11:21.000
Why don't you come down
and enjoy a nice, cold glass...

11:21.083 --> 11:23.709
Hey, Clara.
That's a beautiful top.

11:23.792 --> 11:25.166
Catastrophe-chic!

11:25.250 --> 11:27.291
-Hey, Spike.
-Hey, pal.

11:27.375 --> 11:29.834
Have you ever masturbated
to a constellation?

11:29.917 --> 11:33.375
Yes. Once. Gemini. Twins!

11:33.458 --> 11:35.667
Hey! What are you guys
talking about?

11:35.750 --> 11:38.333
-Star clusters.
-What about you, Frank?

11:38.417 --> 11:40.458
Three years,
time to find the new you?

11:40.542 --> 11:42.834
Yeah, that's funny,
my dad had a funny expression.

11:42.917 --> 11:47.208
He used to say, "Frank,
moderation in all things,

11:47.291 --> 11:48.667
including moderation."

11:48.750 --> 11:50.333
Um, that's moderately funny.

11:50.417 --> 11:54.917
Okay, Frank, what's the craziest
thing you've ever done?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.875
Taking out a bridge loan.

11:56.959 --> 11:59.208
What's the craziest thing
you've ever wanted to do?

12:01.542 --> 12:03.250
I've always wanted to wear
a necklace.

12:03.333 --> 12:05.583
Not a jewelry kind,
but a leather one.

12:05.667 --> 12:07.750
-Uh-huh.
-Maybe with a shell.

12:07.834 --> 12:09.208
All right.

12:09.291 --> 12:10.542
Why stop with a shell?

12:10.625 --> 12:13.458
Maybe you could wear,
I don't know, a dolphin dick.

12:13.542 --> 12:16.709
Yeah, oh, yeah, a dolphin dick.
Hard to come by, though.

12:16.792 --> 12:19.250
-Or you could grow a ponytail.
-(SIGHS)

12:19.333 --> 12:21.291
-Like Spike.
-No, he couldn't. Few can.

12:21.375 --> 12:24.667
I have peculiarly
muscular follicles.

12:24.750 --> 12:27.041
You can be any Frank you want.

12:27.125 --> 12:29.166
-SPIKE: Go for it, Frank.
-Right?

12:29.250 --> 12:30.291
Great.

12:30.375 --> 12:33.125
-You could be punk rock Frank.
-(LAUGHS)

12:33.208 --> 12:34.583
Huh?

12:34.667 --> 12:36.583
You could be
Christian Scientist Frank.

12:36.667 --> 12:39.375
-Occasionally gay Frank.
-Maybe.

12:39.458 --> 12:42.250
-Slightly racist Frank!
-Frank the fiend.

12:42.333 --> 12:45.125
You could be whatever
the fuck you want. Okay?

12:45.208 --> 12:46.792
-Yes.
-You want another Judd martini?

12:46.875 --> 12:47.750
What was that?

12:47.834 --> 12:49.667
Do you want another
Judd martini?

12:51.750 --> 12:53.709
-Yes. Yes, yes.
-Yes, you do! Yes.

12:53.792 --> 12:55.792
-Hell-- Hell yes!
-Yes, you do!

12:55.875 --> 12:58.250
Olivia, can we get
another martini for the man?

12:58.333 --> 13:00.709
-No olive this time, please.
-Make it dirty.

13:02.834 --> 13:05.709
N-- Strictly 19 people,
Mrs. Hines.

13:05.792 --> 13:07.166
I have you down as widowed.

13:07.250 --> 13:09.542
Yes, but James is
my new friend, and I thought--

13:09.625 --> 13:11.458
Wow, I guess grief
wants what it wants, right?

13:11.542 --> 13:13.583
All right, uh, couples,
stand together, please,

13:13.667 --> 13:16.250
and I will approach you
as a double unit, okay?

13:18.583 --> 13:20.500
Iris-- Iris!

13:20.583 --> 13:22.291
Can you please take care
of the widow?

13:22.375 --> 13:24.041
She's very clingy.

13:24.125 --> 13:27.417
Hi. Herman Judd, mogul. You know
that already, though, don't you?

13:27.500 --> 13:29.333
-(LAUGHS)
-You guys look great together.

13:29.417 --> 13:31.500
You make
a very successful merger.

13:31.583 --> 13:34.917
That's CEO talk.
That's CEO talk. Hug?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.250
-Oh.
-(CHUCKLES)

13:37.083 --> 13:40.041
(WHISPERING) One, two, three.

13:40.125 --> 13:42.125
I got it. I did
the math in my head.

13:42.208 --> 13:44.917
Three-second rule, am I right?
Didn't that feel nice?

13:45.000 --> 13:47.834
And nobody crossed any lines.
Look at all these smiles!

13:47.917 --> 13:50.166
I-- I-- There's a laundry cart
blockade on--

13:50.250 --> 13:51.500
What's that? Good, good.

13:51.583 --> 13:53.959
Why don't you guys make your way
over by the skulls over there,

13:54.041 --> 13:55.625
all four Beatles.

13:55.709 --> 13:58.208
Hi. Herman Judd, entreprenaut.

13:58.291 --> 13:59.667
So, do we have to keep paying

13:59.750 --> 14:01.333
now that we're
stranded out here, or--

14:01.417 --> 14:03.792
You know what, why don't
I give you guys

14:03.875 --> 14:05.375
a private tour
of my own quarters?

14:05.458 --> 14:06.875
We're gonna shake things up.

14:06.959 --> 14:09.417
What we have to do
is we have to transform

14:09.500 --> 14:13.041
those faulty sex bots upstairs
from risible into plausible.

14:13.125 --> 14:15.125
They have to be absolutely
convincing,

14:15.208 --> 14:17.709
especially Sarah-slash-Sarah,

14:17.792 --> 14:20.542
who is driving me
slash-wrists insane.

14:20.625 --> 14:22.792
-(LAUGHTER)
-(BILLIE LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY)

14:24.291 --> 14:25.542
-CYRUS: I have an idea.
-That's funny.

14:25.625 --> 14:28.875
What if we connect
a real comms link

14:28.959 --> 14:30.500
to their prop headsets?

14:30.583 --> 14:34.083
That is brilliant! You see,
that is exactly the sort of idea

14:34.166 --> 14:36.458
I should've had
if I weren't a complete fraud.

14:36.542 --> 14:37.959
(LAUGHTER)

14:38.041 --> 14:40.417
We could tell them
exactly what to say.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.583
So, you wouldn't have Nadia
sitting there like,

14:42.667 --> 14:45.417
(FRENCH ACCENT) "I'm Nadia,
and I'm nominal."

14:45.500 --> 14:48.250
(GIGGLES) "And the systems
are nominal." (GIGGLES)

14:48.333 --> 14:50.667
(DANISH ACCENT) Oh, hey,
my name is Mads, and I am from

14:50.750 --> 14:53.417
-Spain or somewhere.
-(LAUGHTER)

14:53.500 --> 14:55.583
(ENGLISH ACCENT)
Uh, hi, my name is Ryan,

14:55.667 --> 14:57.625
and I'm a captain
and an alcoholic.

14:57.709 --> 14:59.291
(LAUGHTER AND GASPING)

14:59.375 --> 15:01.709
Uh, that's-- that's--
that's actually not true.

15:01.792 --> 15:02.959
I'm not a captain.

15:05.667 --> 15:07.291
One of my prized possessions.

15:07.375 --> 15:10.083
First edition
of Billy McFarland's book.

15:10.166 --> 15:12.417
This was way before he became
head of the FBI.

15:12.500 --> 15:17.500
Here are the skulls
of all four Beatles.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.542
All signed.
Not by them, obviously.

15:19.625 --> 15:21.250
That would be impossible.
I signed them.

15:21.333 --> 15:26.125
This is how it all began.
This is when I had my big idea.

15:26.208 --> 15:28.709
This is... not the original.
I threw that one out.

15:29.959 --> 15:32.625
So, I'd better go and have
another drink now.

15:32.709 --> 15:35.417
One of Judd's "my parents
never loved me" parties.

15:35.500 --> 15:36.542
(LAUGHTER)

15:36.625 --> 15:38.709
-Fly safe!
-Fly drunk!

15:38.792 --> 15:42.375
(CHUCKLING) How do you do it?
I thought they'd hate you.

15:42.458 --> 15:44.125
If it's any consolation,
I hate me.

15:44.208 --> 15:46.542
So, what does your husband do?

15:46.625 --> 15:49.583
He's dead. He died in a fire
three months ago.

15:49.667 --> 15:53.083
Oh, right, right. The widow.
Uh, we-- we've mingled already.

15:53.166 --> 15:55.750
No weather in space. Right?

15:58.083 --> 16:00.375
Makes it hard to talk about
the weather,

16:00.458 --> 16:01.834
which I'm kind of illustrating.

16:01.917 --> 16:05.834
I'm sorry, I don't understand
the nature of what you are.

16:05.917 --> 16:08.875
Yeah, my nature is currently
evolving. Look at this. Look.

16:08.959 --> 16:10.792
(AMERICAN ACCENT)
Anybody order a captain?

16:10.875 --> 16:12.166
-Judd champagne?
-Thank you.

16:12.250 --> 16:15.083
Have you seen Mr. Judd's
skulls of the four Beatles?

16:15.166 --> 16:17.834
(ENGLISH ACCENT)
Four Beatles? John Lennon
was cremated, wasn't he?

16:17.917 --> 16:19.250
All right,
keep that to yourself.

16:19.333 --> 16:21.750
I think one of the skulls
is actually Micky Dolenz.

16:23.709 --> 16:26.125
Oh, that is just
pure arse juice.

16:26.208 --> 16:28.750
I don't believe we've had
the pleasure. Herman Judd.

16:28.834 --> 16:30.166
Oh! Karen Kelly.

16:30.250 --> 16:33.375
Ah! Great. Your, uh, nails
are very long and very sharp.

16:33.458 --> 16:36.667
Thank you! I've been practicing
my handshake since grade school.

16:36.750 --> 16:38.250
-Did she break the skin?
-No.

16:38.333 --> 16:41.834
Okay, good. I like you.
You know how to handle people.

16:41.917 --> 16:44.250
Basically a cattle prod
in a dress.

16:44.333 --> 16:45.834
Enjoying your wine, captain?

16:45.917 --> 16:47.000
JUDD: Mm!

16:47.083 --> 16:50.417
Now, Karen, putting your
passenger hat on for a second,

16:50.500 --> 16:53.041
what more can Iris be doing?

16:53.125 --> 16:57.375
Well, there's quite a divide
between staff and passengers.

16:57.458 --> 17:00.542
-Mm.
-Is that really Gone Girl
on an original Kindle?

17:00.625 --> 17:01.750
Sorry, not now. We're talking.

17:01.834 --> 17:04.792
This is a restricted
conversational area. Thank you.

17:05.917 --> 17:10.041
So, I would suggest,
I don't know, maybe a photo?

17:10.125 --> 17:13.000
Everyone together, you know,
laughing, hitting it off.

17:13.083 --> 17:15.542
-Maybe on the bridge!
-(IRIS LAUGHS)

17:15.625 --> 17:17.625
-That's a shitty idea.
-I love this idea.

17:17.709 --> 17:21.291
-As in, that idea is the shit!
-So, we're all agreed

17:21.375 --> 17:24.208
that-- that Karen's idea
is very much the shit.

17:24.959 --> 17:26.333
Claw lady's on to something.

17:26.417 --> 17:30.083
We show the people of Earth
a moment of unity.

17:30.166 --> 17:32.250
We have another slingshot
moment coming up

17:32.333 --> 17:34.458
in less than an hour,
around Enceladus.

17:34.542 --> 17:38.083
This is perfect. We get a bunch
of passengers on the bridge,

17:38.166 --> 17:39.375
get some Mr. Average

17:39.458 --> 17:41.583
to push that fake button we have
for the kids.

17:41.667 --> 17:44.083
(ENGLISH ACCENT) Why would
you put that idea into his head?

17:44.166 --> 17:46.125
If you could have put anything
in there,

17:46.208 --> 17:47.417
why not general anesthetic?

17:47.500 --> 17:50.166
What is your problem,
you big whinebag?

17:50.250 --> 17:51.792
Well, things on the bridge...

17:51.875 --> 17:53.750
Ah, it's a little fluid
right now.

17:53.834 --> 17:56.208
Yeah, tell me about it.
You're at 85 percent fluid.

I don't like it, as a moon.

18:06.041 --> 18:08.542
All right, you middle-aged

18:08.625 --> 18:10.959

to be announced ship-wide.

18:11.041 --> 18:12.333

18:17.500 --> 18:19.041
Oh, hi, honey. Thank you.

18:19.125 --> 18:23.375

Can I join the party? (LAUGHS)

-(KAREN CHUCKLES)
-JUDD: He'll do.

18:27.166 --> 18:29.542
I feel like I'm the prom queen
or something.

Drunk on cheap wine,
I'm ready to lose my virginity.

18:32.583 --> 18:33.500
(LAUGHS) Yeah!

18:33.583 --> 18:35.375
And I would deflower you

I am so proud of you, Frank!

18:36.834 --> 18:39.000

kinda nice, earlier,

18:54.125 --> 18:57.208
to talk, you know, like people,
not barking like dogs.

18:57.291 --> 18:58.792

-(LAUGHS) Yeah.

tiramisu me up too, buddy!

19:04.500 --> 19:07.375
Ah, I'm afraid
there's only one left.

we're out of tiramisu?

-Yeah.
-Oh, my God, this is big.

19:15.625 --> 19:18.375

"I better get it then."

19:24.250 --> 19:25.250
Not "us."

19:25.333 --> 19:27.375
Well, "Us better get it"
isn't a sentence, Doug!

19:27.458 --> 19:30.834

and shove it right up your ass.

19:34.166 --> 19:36.542

I wanted to be a rapper.
