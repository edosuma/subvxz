(people chattering and laughing)

00:19.078 --> 00:19.685
              Where is she?

00:23.098 --> 00:24.248
     Damn, I'm good!

00:24.250 --> 00:27.434
                 O-M to the G.

00:27.511 --> 00:29.586
             Tahlia,
      you are incredible.

00:29.588 --> 00:32.756
 Wow, cool hair!

00:32.758 --> 00:34.516
       Oh, Butler,
snap a few pics, will ya?

00:34.593 --> 00:37.536
       Oh why, oh why, couldn't
       my last name be Senator

00:37.613 --> 00:37.870
             instead of Butler?

00:39.598 --> 00:40.873
      -Ah,
-Yeah, give me that.

00:40.949 --> 00:41.782
Grace: Come here!
  Let me see.

00:43.485 --> 00:45.026
  This one. Yes.

00:45.104 --> 00:47.529
        Perfect!

00:47.606 --> 00:50.107
 Hashtag "naughty list."
    I got to fix it.

00:50.109 --> 00:51.792
                      Oh, yeah.

00:51.868 --> 00:53.201
      You should throw a filt--

00:53.279 --> 00:54.720
      -What do you think?
           -(gasps)

00:54.797 --> 00:56.555
          Hot.

00:56.632 --> 00:59.207
    -Butler: That is hot AF.
        -Tahlia: Mm-hmm.

00:59.285 --> 01:04.212
     Look at your mom.
Girl! she had some swagger.

01:04.290 --> 01:05.230
                  You both look
                 really happy.

01:05.307 --> 01:06.807
         Tahlia: Yeah.

01:06.883 --> 01:09.626
It was all for show.
Obligatory Christmas card photo.

01:09.628 --> 01:11.886
             It's okay to,
         you know, miss her.

01:11.964 --> 01:13.647
       Well, I don't.

01:13.723 --> 01:15.632
      It's kinda hard
     to miss someone

01:15.634 --> 01:16.408
that was never really around
    in the first place.

01:17.803 --> 01:19.970
                          Mm.

01:19.972 --> 01:21.113
Anyway, I am gonna
finish getting ready.

01:21.189 --> 01:21.896
                         Okay.

01:21.974 --> 01:22.739
   Go!

01:24.476 --> 01:25.084
Butler: I am so...

01:25.160 --> 01:26.326
              ¶ ¶

01:37.747 --> 01:40.048
       (Christmas hip-hop
         music playing)

01:48.667 --> 01:49.391
           Thank you.

01:51.520 --> 01:53.337
    All right!

01:53.339 --> 01:54.671
           All: Yeah!

01:54.673 --> 01:55.730
Let me see that.

01:58.677 --> 01:59.234
       Perfect!

02:01.196 --> 02:02.788
                    Thanks, G.
                   Great party.

02:02.865 --> 02:05.015
         Thanks, Perez.
          Shots later.

02:05.017 --> 02:05.615
     Hoo!

02:08.520 --> 02:10.963
   -I mean, it's hard, but--
    -Why is Jen Chen here?

02:11.038 --> 02:13.290
      She's such a vibe killer.
         Did I invite her?

02:14.877 --> 02:15.584
        I-I don't know.

02:17.787 --> 02:18.753
Oh God, she doesn't
remember inviting me.

02:20.199 --> 02:21.882
  I knew it.

02:21.958 --> 02:24.977
Just smile and wave.

02:25.053 --> 02:27.387
         Smiling and... waving.

02:27.464 --> 02:29.297
           Do we know
           who he is?

02:29.375 --> 02:30.374
                  I don't know,
                 but he's hot.

02:30.376 --> 02:30.974
Super hot!

02:33.712 --> 02:35.937
          I mean, he's okay.

02:37.883 --> 02:39.324
           Tahlia:
   Nah! He's too pretty.

02:39.401 --> 02:41.234
    Butler:
Grace is into bad boys.

02:41.311 --> 02:41.610
        -Remember that
       football player?
           -Right.

02:43.889 --> 02:46.740
        -That summer
      was so much fun!
        -Okay, okay.

02:46.816 --> 02:49.609
 You guys, I'm hosting a party.
       Come on, let's go.

02:49.687 --> 02:51.336
     (dance music playing)

03:02.090 --> 03:03.498
                   Ah!

03:03.575 --> 03:04.007
                   Get down.
                  Get down.

03:08.931 --> 03:11.640
           (yelling)

03:14.920 --> 03:16.420
           (clapping)

03:16.422 --> 03:17.845
         Pancake time!

03:17.923 --> 03:19.531
         (Butler claps)

03:19.608 --> 03:22.016
              Mmm, Butler.

03:22.094 --> 03:22.984
 You are literally killing me.

03:24.688 --> 03:26.038
       What are you doing here?

03:26.114 --> 03:27.614
You were in no position
to be left alone last night.

03:28.934 --> 03:30.542
     Oh God.
    (sighs)

03:32.287 --> 03:32.869
How much do you remember?

03:38.627 --> 03:39.534
     Grace: <i> Did I make out</i>
     <i> with someone random?</i>

03:39.611 --> 03:40.710
        Mmm.

03:42.706 --> 03:43.871
      Did I dance on the table?

03:43.949 --> 03:45.282
    (hip-hop music playing)

03:45.284 --> 03:47.676
       (people cheering)

03:49.379 --> 03:52.138
               When your mom's
                a criminal!

03:52.215 --> 03:53.457
    Grace: <i> Did I make</i>
 <i> an inappropriate toast</i>

03:53.459 --> 03:54.900
      <i> that included a dig</i>
          <i> at my mom?</i>

03:54.977 --> 03:55.567
    Grace: All the respon--

03:56.962 --> 03:57.978
    Sure did.

03:58.054 --> 03:58.962
            (groans)

03:58.964 --> 04:00.297
     Look, honey,

04:00.299 --> 04:03.057
I know you've had a rough year
    since she's been gone

04:03.135 --> 04:05.226
  and I will always be
     by your side,

04:05.304 --> 04:06.728
    but it's time
to take it down a notch.

04:06.805 --> 04:08.080
   Don't you think?

04:08.156 --> 04:10.916
How proud are you that I
didn't just break out into song

04:10.993 --> 04:12.251
when I said
"since she's been gone"?

04:12.327 --> 04:13.901
              Honestly, I am
             so proud of you.

04:13.979 --> 04:15.328
    Thank you.

04:15.405 --> 04:16.904
(cell phone ringing and buzzing)

04:16.982 --> 04:17.923
       (gasps)

04:18.000 --> 04:19.423
         (Grace groans)

04:21.487 --> 04:22.152
                       Great.

04:22.154 --> 04:24.170
                      I'm late.

04:24.247 --> 04:25.597
      Okay. Up and at 'em.

04:27.751 --> 04:30.327
 TMZ is reporting on a certain
      toy store heiress

04:30.329 --> 04:33.163
 who got shmammered
and made out with a roast pig

04:33.165 --> 04:34.347
          at her holiday party.

04:34.424 --> 04:36.591
            Well, that's just
           crappy journalism.

04:36.668 --> 04:38.001
             'Cause it wasn't
             a holiday party.

04:38.003 --> 04:40.170
             All I am saying is
               it's not good

04:40.172 --> 04:41.671
        for a company to have
      its CEO acting all cray.

04:41.673 --> 04:42.281
           All eyes are on you.

04:42.357 --> 04:44.599
                    Whatevs.

04:44.676 --> 04:46.618
    <i> Marathon Toys is still</i>

04:46.695 --> 04:48.436

         Reporter:

05:18.060 --> 05:19.467
          Why do they always
          use that picture?

05:19.545 --> 05:21.135
           I literally have
         so many better ones.

05:21.213 --> 05:24.972

05:31.056 --> 05:32.389
       Grace, how nice
     of you to join us.

05:32.391 --> 05:33.832
No prob. Hi, guys.

05:33.909 --> 05:37.169
You know, we set these meetings
   at noon per your request

05:37.245 --> 05:38.670
         to give you ample time
            in the mornings.

05:38.747 --> 05:39.654
      It'd be nice if you could
          be here on time.

05:39.731 --> 05:42.507
Oh wow.

05:42.584 --> 05:44.067
You know,
I've never had a dad.

05:44.069 --> 05:45.569
   I didn't know
this is what it was like.

05:45.571 --> 05:49.631
A lecture in my board room
in front of my board members.

05:52.001 --> 05:52.634
  You're in my seat.

05:58.508 --> 06:00.359
      We get absolutely crushed
          on Cyber Monday.

06:00.435 --> 06:01.360
So apparently
closing down 250 stores

06:01.436 --> 06:02.936
isn't enough
to boost online sales.

06:03.012 --> 06:06.256
There was an article in the
<i> Wall Street Journal </i> last week,

06:06.258 --> 06:07.273
"How Toy Makers Lost
Their Christmas Magic."

06:07.350 --> 06:08.533
      Read it.

06:08.610 --> 06:10.035
            Well, they're
         not exactly wrong.

06:10.112 --> 06:11.277
          I mean,
  we've kind of lost it.

06:11.354 --> 06:12.687
     It's almost like
we just don't care anymore.

06:12.764 --> 06:15.707
 That's definitely true
for some people in this room.

06:15.784 --> 06:16.766
   What is it
we're having for lunch?

06:16.768 --> 06:17.859
        Oh, my God.

06:17.936 --> 06:19.285
      Grace: I'm starving.

06:19.362 --> 06:20.937
           Kids love toys.
       And they always will.

06:20.939 --> 06:23.773
       They're just not playing
        with the same old toys

06:23.775 --> 06:24.958
        that their parents did.
          So sales are down

06:25.034 --> 06:27.794
           because our products
             are uninspired.

06:27.871 --> 06:30.447
Where else can we
possibly cut cost?

06:30.449 --> 06:33.133
 I suggest we discontinue
some of our old inventory

06:33.209 --> 06:35.727
to free up funds needed
for the video game apps.

06:35.804 --> 06:37.287
         I've complied
        a list of toys

06:37.289 --> 06:38.713
   that are frankly bleeding
      this company dry.

06:38.790 --> 06:40.123
  I say we put each to a vote.

06:40.125 --> 06:41.382
 Think that all sounds
     a bit hasty.

06:41.460 --> 06:43.810
 We are out of time, Carter.

06:43.887 --> 06:45.311
  We are on the <i> Titanic,</i>
   <i> </i> and we need to get

06:45.388 --> 06:46.312
 what's left of this company
      into lifeboats.

06:46.389 --> 06:48.240
You guys, I love that movie.

06:48.316 --> 06:49.557
He's so hot.

06:49.635 --> 06:51.392
The Marine Life Finger Puppets.

06:51.470 --> 06:53.470
All in favor
to discontinue?

06:53.472 --> 06:54.320
         Board members:
              Aye.

06:54.397 --> 06:56.063
       Prickly Puddy.

06:56.141 --> 06:57.732
              No one has bought
              that since 2007.

06:57.809 --> 07:00.326
                 All in favor
               to discontinue?

07:00.403 --> 07:00.577
         Board members:
              Aye.

07:03.498 --> 07:03.913
         The Eve Doll.

07:05.651 --> 07:08.485
  The Eve doll is iconic.

07:08.487 --> 07:10.003
  We lose that,
we lose our identity.

07:10.079 --> 07:12.264
  We'll have
a new identity, Carter.

07:12.340 --> 07:13.765
              Eve hasn't turned
             a profit in years.

07:13.842 --> 07:14.090
 We can't do that.

07:16.419 --> 07:17.552
  Eleanor founded this company
       with the Eve doll.

07:20.165 --> 07:20.722
      Grace.

07:27.506 --> 07:28.021
     Discontinue the doll.

07:30.525 --> 07:32.175
       I doubt it's what
      my mom would want,

07:32.177 --> 07:34.602
       but she's not here
       to make that call.

07:34.680 --> 07:38.072
  So... all in favor
to discontinue the Eve doll?

07:40.686 --> 07:41.293
         board members:
              Aye.

07:41.369 --> 07:42.852
             Great.

07:42.854 --> 07:43.578
       We are just about
      done here, right?

07:49.861 --> 07:52.954
 Can't believe you voted
to discontinue Eve so quickly.

07:53.031 --> 07:54.364
          How do you even know
              about that?

07:54.366 --> 07:58.477
  That literally just happened
    in a private boardroom.

07:58.553 --> 08:00.312
               I have spies.
            Spies everywhere.

08:00.388 --> 08:02.630
   -Butler.
-Carter, Carter actually.

08:02.708 --> 08:04.298
           He-- Carter told me.

08:04.376 --> 08:06.151
   That Carter Roth?

08:06.228 --> 08:07.319
   That cutie
from my boardroom.

08:07.395 --> 08:09.488
     We text from time to time.

08:09.564 --> 08:11.472
        At what time?
  Midnight till four a.m.?

08:11.550 --> 08:13.825
 'Cause that's called sexting,
         not texting.

08:13.902 --> 08:17.554
All I am saying is that your mom
     created the Eve doll.

08:17.556 --> 08:18.497
 It should mean more to you
     than anyone else.

08:18.573 --> 08:19.723
      And you just cut
    her head right off.

08:19.725 --> 08:22.334
     -La-la-la-la-la.
  -Oh wow, very mature.

08:22.410 --> 08:23.393
              Hey, we're about
             to go pick up Lex.

08:23.395 --> 08:24.894
        You would fit right in.

08:24.896 --> 08:26.171
        Girl: (laughing)
         I know, right?

08:30.326 --> 08:31.826
Oh, my god, look at that chick.
          (laughing)

08:31.903 --> 08:32.827
     What the hell
are they laughing at?

08:32.904 --> 08:33.962
                 I know. Right.

08:35.924 --> 08:37.515
                Uh, uh, imagine
               those headlines.

08:37.592 --> 08:40.167
 "CEO of Marathon Toys attacks
 a group of 12-year-old girls

08:40.245 --> 08:42.428
 defending her young neighbor."

08:42.505 --> 08:43.429
       -Don't do it.
    -(girls laughing)

08:48.420 --> 08:51.012
           -Hi.
        -Lex: Hi.

08:51.089 --> 08:51.271
      -Butler: Hi, honey.
             -Hi.

08:55.351 --> 08:57.927
    -Thanks for the pickup.
         -No problem.

08:57.929 --> 08:59.445
             None of my nannies
            could drive either.

08:59.522 --> 09:00.613
            I was always
        catching rides home.

09:00.690 --> 09:02.432
Oh, no, Carmen can drive.

09:02.434 --> 09:05.451
  It's just, she always wants
     to hear about my day

09:05.528 --> 09:07.787
or practice my vocab words

09:07.864 --> 09:10.197
or ask if I made
any new friends.

09:10.275 --> 09:12.792
It's just like I just need
    a break sometimes.

09:12.869 --> 09:16.388
              Uh, Lex, who were
             those Dweebettes.

09:16.464 --> 09:18.448
They are in the Christmas
    pageant with me.

09:18.450 --> 09:20.058
The one with the braid
      is Marley.

09:20.135 --> 09:21.893
        She's playing
      the Virgin Mary.

09:21.970 --> 09:23.620
I'm cattle number seven.

09:23.622 --> 09:26.213
  Moooo!

09:26.291 --> 09:27.566
           (chuckles)

09:27.642 --> 09:30.627
Well, cattle are a very
important part of the nativity,

09:30.629 --> 09:32.128
    so that's pretty cool, Lex.

09:32.130 --> 09:33.387
I tried to interest them
    in my magic act,

09:33.465 --> 09:36.908
  but that didn't
go over too well.

09:36.985 --> 09:39.226
          Lex, if these girls
        are being mean to you,

09:39.304 --> 09:41.154
         you just say the word.

09:41.230 --> 09:42.972
          I won't stop until
        every last one of them

09:42.974 --> 09:45.658
       is shipped off to some
     miserable boarding school

09:45.735 --> 09:46.567
          and you'll never have
           to see them again.

09:46.645 --> 09:48.995
        Wow.

09:49.072 --> 09:50.980
(chuckles)
That's kind of aggressive.

09:50.982 --> 09:52.315
  Ignore her.
Grace is having a rough day.

09:52.317 --> 09:55.318
      Discontinued the Eve doll
       at her board meeting.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.429
What? No, you can't
 discontinue Eve.

09:57.505 --> 09:59.246
She's my favorite doll.

09:59.324 --> 10:00.915
               Lex, the company
                is in trouble.

10:00.992 --> 10:04.102
It's, it's way more complicated
    than you can imagine.

10:04.179 --> 10:06.012
  If the company
  is in trouble,

10:06.089 --> 10:07.439
  you should just ask
    Eve for help.

10:07.515 --> 10:10.257
Your mom told me that
whenever I felt lost or alone,

10:10.335 --> 10:12.502
   I could ask Eve for help.

10:12.504 --> 10:13.945
I could make a wish
 and like magic,

10:14.022 --> 10:15.763
it would be all right.

10:15.841 --> 10:17.857
     Yeah, no, I know.
She told me the same thing.

10:17.934 --> 10:20.026
           But, Lex, come on,

10:20.103 --> 10:23.955
 we're both old enough now
to know that magic isn't real.

10:24.032 --> 10:27.441
  No one can fix our problems,
   especially not some doll.

10:27.519 --> 10:30.111
  Magic is real.

10:30.188 --> 10:32.113
  You just need to believe it.

10:32.190 --> 10:34.858
     Okay, well, this super fun
      conversation reminds me.

10:34.860 --> 10:37.451
            Um, Butler, I need
           to stop by the store

10:37.529 --> 10:38.044
         to pick up a box
     of my mom's old things.

10:48.707 --> 10:49.222
           Thank you.

11:17.827 --> 11:18.251
       Let's go.

11:24.075 --> 11:26.008
              ¶ ¶

12:21.390 --> 12:23.891
   Is that your old Eve doll?

12:23.969 --> 12:25.234
          Geez, Lex, you scared
          the crap out of me.

12:27.973 --> 12:30.081
                Yeah, this is
              my old Eve doll.

12:30.158 --> 12:33.326
                 A4114.

12:33.402 --> 12:34.410
      It's the serial number
    on the bottom of her foot.

12:35.981 --> 12:37.738
  I don't know why that number
   just always stuck with me.

12:37.816 --> 12:40.650
      Maybe you are having
       a change of heart

12:40.652 --> 12:41.417
about discontinuing
  the Eve doll.

12:43.822 --> 12:45.822
         Sorry, Lex,
  it's beyond my control.

12:45.824 --> 12:48.749
But it is not beyond Eve's.

12:48.827 --> 12:49.934
    -What is this?
-It's a book of spells.

12:50.011 --> 12:52.261
    I found it in your
   mom's box of stuff.

13:00.188 --> 13:02.338
     "To Eleanor,
this book changed my life."

13:02.340 --> 13:04.857
         "Maybe some other
     little girl can use it.

13:04.934 --> 13:07.786
                Casey."

13:07.862 --> 13:09.436
We could use this
to ask Eve for help, right?

13:09.514 --> 13:12.624
             Oh, sweets. I wish
             it was that easy.

13:12.700 --> 13:14.534
   Maybe it is that easy.

13:14.610 --> 13:15.076
        -Magic is not--
        -Don't say it.

13:16.538 --> 13:17.954
     Magic is real.

13:19.524 --> 13:21.299
                        (sighs)

13:21.376 --> 13:22.625
             Fine. You want
          to hold a seance...

13:25.030 --> 13:25.962
     -we'll hold a seance.
            -Yay!

13:30.626 --> 13:32.385
           -(exhales)
             -Okay.

13:32.461 --> 13:33.294
                We have lit
             all the candles.

13:33.371 --> 13:34.979
                What's next?

13:35.056 --> 13:37.098
       Um, now we need
         some hair.

13:39.210 --> 13:40.467
              Don't look at me.

13:40.545 --> 13:42.895
     (chuckles)
Not yours, the doll's.

13:42.972 --> 13:43.479
              Oh, I'll do that.

13:50.055 --> 13:52.613
"You are now ready to commence
    with the incantation.

13:55.226 --> 13:57.910
"But do so wisely
for it will only work once.

13:59.397 --> 14:02.582
"Repeat the spell until the
transformation is complete.

14:03.751 --> 14:08.921
        <i> "Zamba, tarka,</i>
       <i> ishtu, nebarim.</i>

14:08.998 --> 14:10.181
 <i> Zamba, tarka,</i>
<i> ishtu, nebarim."</i>

14:11.926 --> 14:13.259
        Well, what do you know?

14:15.413 --> 14:18.505
        Turns out magic
   doesn't work after all.

14:18.583 --> 14:20.099
You have to do it too.

14:20.176 --> 14:20.850
  It's your doll.

14:22.420 --> 14:26.105
Come on, Grace.
We're trying to save
 your company here.

14:26.182 --> 14:26.698
       -Mm-hmm.
  -Close your eyes.

14:28.351 --> 14:32.428
 Together:
<i> Zamba, tarka, ishtu, nebarim.</i>

14:32.430 --> 14:36.207
 <i> Zamba, tarka, ishtu, nebarim.</i>

14:36.284 --> 14:39.210
        <i> Zamba, tarka,</i>
       <i> ishtu, nebarim.</i>

14:39.287 --> 14:41.537
 <i> Zamba, tarka, ishtu, nebarim.</i>

14:47.278 --> 14:48.720
              (inhales sharply)
                Okey-dokey.

14:50.448 --> 14:54.541
  So, what do you say tomorrow
  we sacrifice a small animal?

14:54.619 --> 14:56.895
You are not very much fun.

14:56.971 --> 14:59.213
  -Ouch!
-I should get going anyway.

14:59.290 --> 15:01.124
 Carmen's making
her famous meatloaf.

15:01.126 --> 15:04.127
             Meatloaf?
       I'm the un-fun one?

15:04.129 --> 15:06.796
Oh, it isn't as bad
   as it seems.

15:06.798 --> 15:08.555
Where's your mom anyway?

15:08.633 --> 15:09.298
                  I don't know.

15:09.300 --> 15:11.225
                 Um, Singapore,

15:11.302 --> 15:11.734
                      Tokyo...

15:13.229 --> 15:14.987
                      Paris.

15:15.064 --> 15:15.738
You can hang here.

15:17.492 --> 15:19.492
                 So, you're not
                   going out?

15:19.568 --> 15:21.568
I mean, I did just try
to cast a spell on a doll

15:21.646 --> 15:24.480
to save my company
with a 12-year-old. So...

15:24.482 --> 15:25.590
       I kinda deserve
        a night out.

15:25.667 --> 15:28.760
          (chuckles) Whatever.
         I'll see you tomorrow.

15:28.836 --> 15:29.743
       -Good night.
    -Lex: Good night.

15:29.821 --> 15:30.878
  Enjoy your meatloaf.

15:35.493 --> 15:36.384
     What's so special
    about you anyway?

15:46.171 --> 15:48.780
              ¶ ¶

16:08.376 --> 16:11.118
  Grace. You're awake?

16:11.196 --> 16:12.712
          Hi.

16:12.788 --> 16:14.973
         -Hi.
    -Look at you.

16:18.870 --> 16:20.979
       Uh, did we last night...

16:21.055 --> 16:23.556
   Did we what?

16:23.632 --> 16:24.540
                Sleep together?

16:24.542 --> 16:26.800
       We sure did.

16:26.878 --> 16:29.153
 And it was magical.

16:29.230 --> 16:31.397
I've waited a very long time
      for this moment.

16:31.474 --> 16:32.106
                 This moment?

16:34.385 --> 16:34.775
          Am I your first girl?

16:36.221 --> 16:40.498
Yes. And it was everything
 I imagined it would be.

16:43.228 --> 16:43.951
     (giggles)

16:45.654 --> 16:48.172
     I'm sorry,
I don't remember your name.

16:48.249 --> 16:51.992
   It's me. Eve.

16:52.070 --> 16:54.904
Come on.
You don't remember me?

16:54.906 --> 16:56.681
          I hooked up
    with a girl named Eve.

16:59.244 --> 17:00.685
                 Wow, I really
               do have issues.

17:06.099 --> 17:09.101
             Wow! Atlanta!

17:09.178 --> 17:11.345
           Or Hotlanta,
         as they call it?

17:11.422 --> 17:13.347
   Home of the Georgia Peach!

17:13.424 --> 17:15.608
World's largest producer
 of peanuts and pecans!

17:15.684 --> 17:18.094
  And world's busiest airport.

17:18.096 --> 17:20.204
           (mimicking aircraft)

17:20.281 --> 17:21.931
   Let me guess.
It's your first time here?

17:21.933 --> 17:23.357
       Bingo!

17:23.434 --> 17:25.025
          Can I call you a car?

17:25.103 --> 17:26.602
    You can call me Eve!

17:26.604 --> 17:29.455
 I'm so excited!
Can we go outside?

17:29.532 --> 17:32.199
            I mean, you can do
            whatever you want.

17:32.277 --> 17:33.442
   I am not keeping you here.

17:33.444 --> 17:36.445
     But I am gonna get coffee.

17:36.447 --> 17:37.797
  'Cause I need coffee first.

17:37.873 --> 17:40.283
 This place is fancy.

17:40.285 --> 17:42.376
  Almost as fancy
as Eve's modern mansion.

17:42.453 --> 17:43.177
            Almost.

17:49.644 --> 17:51.069
                        Wow!

17:51.145 --> 17:52.645
Dude!
What are you doing?

17:52.721 --> 17:56.799
     Dude.
Jumping on this super-duper
  awesome bouncy couch.

17:56.801 --> 17:58.150
Listen, this was fun. Um,

17:58.227 --> 17:59.318
but, you know,
I've got a big day.

17:59.395 --> 18:03.397
 I've got meetings
and all this other stuff

18:03.474 --> 18:04.916
  I can't think of
off the top of my head.

18:04.992 --> 18:07.343
   So, you smell
what I'm cooking?

18:07.345 --> 18:10.479
                (sniffs)

18:10.481 --> 18:10.755
  You're not cooking anything.

18:12.817 --> 18:14.667
           Oh, is that coffee?

18:14.743 --> 18:15.742
       Uh, yeah.

18:15.820 --> 18:16.418
                   Oh, my gosh,
                  can I try it?

18:18.172 --> 18:21.157
     You know what?
 Don't, don't, don't--
No, no, don't say anything.

18:21.159 --> 18:22.658
  I'm just gonna try it, okay,
         because I like

18:22.660 --> 18:23.175
          trying new things
       and being spontaneous.

18:24.587 --> 18:25.177
       Uh--

18:28.015 --> 18:28.940
            (spits)

18:32.170 --> 18:34.445
           -It's hot.
             -Yeah.

18:34.522 --> 18:36.188
You know, this is true
all around the world.

18:36.265 --> 18:36.897
  Coffee is hot.

18:38.526 --> 18:41.452
You know,
I like it.

18:41.529 --> 18:44.180
Even though I have
severe burns on my tongue,

18:44.182 --> 18:44.864
  I enjoyed the experience
          overall.

18:46.184 --> 18:46.782
           Yeah.

18:48.519 --> 18:50.870
      You know,
do you have butter?

18:50.946 --> 18:51.787
Really want some butter.

18:53.282 --> 18:54.281
                     Okay, Eve.

18:54.359 --> 18:55.207
                    Um, listen.

18:56.711 --> 18:58.952
              I am sure you're
             a really nice girl

18:59.030 --> 19:00.379
                 and we had
                so much fun
             fooling around,

19:00.456 --> 19:02.381
                 but it's time
                for you to go

19:02.458 --> 19:03.215
        because I'm pretty sure
            you're crazy.

19:05.870 --> 19:07.386
    Crazy for you,
     Gracie Girl.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.706
     What did you just call me?

19:10.708 --> 19:11.307
            Only my mom calls--

19:13.060 --> 19:14.152
              Never mind.

19:14.228 --> 19:16.712
       Yeah.

19:16.714 --> 19:17.730
     Only your mom
calls you Gracie Girl.

19:17.806 --> 19:18.397
                      Yeah.

19:20.385 --> 19:20.992
           What do you know
            about my mom?

19:21.068 --> 19:21.901
  Eleanor Martin?

19:23.812 --> 19:25.388
 Founder of Marathon Toys.

19:25.390 --> 19:28.482
   Divine creator
  of the Eve doll.

19:28.559 --> 19:31.151
 Your mother is my hero.

19:31.229 --> 19:33.245
        -(chuckles)
     -Whoo! Eleanor!

19:35.066 --> 19:36.399
                 I get it now.
                  I get it.

19:36.401 --> 19:37.341
            They hired you
          to change my mind.

19:37.418 --> 19:38.918
              Okay, who was it?

19:38.994 --> 19:41.587
          Lex? Butler?

19:41.664 --> 19:42.630
Hey, so, you're an actress
      or something?

19:44.333 --> 19:46.425
                     No, silly.
                      It's me.

19:46.502 --> 19:48.186
              Eve.

19:48.262 --> 19:49.595
                     Your doll.
                     (giggles)

19:51.416 --> 19:52.506
  And I'm your special friend.

19:52.583 --> 19:54.083
          Oh, hell no.

19:54.085 --> 19:54.433
                 Eee!

19:55.920 --> 19:58.087
 Do you want to know what makes
    the Eve doll so special?

19:58.089 --> 19:59.680
          Nope.

19:59.757 --> 20:00.940
             The Eve doll is
           your best friend,

20:01.016 --> 20:02.258
         your secret confidant.

20:02.260 --> 20:05.018
That's great. Literally
what it says on the box.

20:05.096 --> 20:06.278
Thank you. Bye.

20:06.355 --> 20:08.431
        The Eve doll is someone
           you can turn to

20:08.433 --> 20:09.856
               when no one else
                is listening.

20:09.934 --> 20:11.434
Okay, you know what?

20:11.436 --> 20:12.543
You've convinced me.

20:12.620 --> 20:14.528
You're awesome.

20:14.605 --> 20:17.606
 Thank you so much
 for hanging out.

20:17.608 --> 20:18.549
Can you please
just leave me alone now?

20:18.626 --> 20:20.793
          I'm here to help you,
              Gracie Girl.

20:20.869 --> 20:23.203
Quit calling me that!

20:23.281 --> 20:25.205
                   Okay, okay.

20:25.283 --> 20:26.782
       But I'm here to help you

20:26.784 --> 20:28.451
            through the magical
              process of...

20:28.453 --> 20:29.785
                   magic.

20:29.787 --> 20:31.787
         What? No.

20:31.789 --> 20:33.806
That's impossible.

20:33.882 --> 20:34.957
I mean, yeah,
we did the spell but--

20:34.959 --> 20:35.882
               Yeah, the spell.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.309
This is insane.

20:37.386 --> 20:38.627
You are not my doll.

20:38.629 --> 20:40.463
                     Yes, I am.

20:40.465 --> 20:42.298
 I was there for you
when you were eight years old

20:42.300 --> 20:43.148
              and you fell out
             of that tree house

20:43.225 --> 20:44.650
                and you broke
              your collarbone.

20:44.727 --> 20:47.303
  And I was there for you when
  they bullied you in school.

20:47.305 --> 20:49.154
        And I was there for you
       when you became a woman

20:49.231 --> 20:50.564
         on your 13th birthday.

20:50.641 --> 20:51.398
     You had really bad cramps.

20:51.476 --> 20:53.826
       -Okay.
 -Like, really bad.

20:53.902 --> 20:55.253
  Ok-- Shh. Eve.
  (stomps foot)

20:55.329 --> 20:57.480
Okay. You know what?

20:57.482 --> 20:59.482
That's all public knowledge.

20:59.484 --> 21:00.091
It's probably on my
Wikipedia page or something.

21:01.836 --> 21:02.835
   I gotta go.

21:02.911 --> 21:03.594
        Oh, where are we going?

21:03.671 --> 21:05.654
   We are not going anywhere!

21:05.656 --> 21:07.748
I am going somewhere.

21:07.825 --> 21:09.916
The location to which
I will not be disclosing.

21:09.994 --> 21:11.844
And you will be heading
the opposite direction

21:11.920 --> 21:14.163
or I'll be forced
to call the cops.

21:14.165 --> 21:15.606
         The cops? I was a cop.

21:15.683 --> 21:18.017
Oh, I'm an expert in all police
  procedures and protocols.

21:23.007 --> 21:24.097
   Man: Hey, get off my car!

21:24.175 --> 21:25.841
                   See.

21:25.843 --> 21:26.066
       Man:
Get on outta here.

21:30.681 --> 21:31.280
                          Whoo.

21:35.611 --> 21:37.853
Listen up, everybody,
   who is mimosa

21:37.855 --> 21:40.464
and where oh where,
are your bottoms,
  young lady?

21:40.541 --> 21:43.208
            Geez! It is a drink
           made with champagne

21:43.285 --> 21:44.618
              and orange juice.

21:44.695 --> 21:46.879
Hmm. Sounds tasty.

21:46.955 --> 21:47.880
      -Butler: Grace!
   -Tahlia: Over here.

21:47.956 --> 21:49.256
         -Hey!
    -Friends. Oh!

21:52.870 --> 21:55.128
  Oh, hey, seriously,
   whoever decided

21:55.206 --> 21:56.388
  that brunch should
be served this early--

21:56.465 --> 21:56.889
    It's 1:00 in the afternoon.

21:58.543 --> 22:00.392
                Brunch. Cool.

22:00.469 --> 22:03.379
    Br-eakfast and lu-unch.

22:03.381 --> 22:04.813
       Brunch.
     (chuckles)

22:05.733 --> 22:06.991
     (chuckles)

22:07.068 --> 22:10.402
Uh, are you gonna introduce us
     to your lady friend?

22:10.479 --> 22:13.146
              Um... yeah. Sure.

22:13.224 --> 22:14.073
This is my...

22:16.077 --> 22:17.335
        -friend I guess.
         -Best friend.

22:17.411 --> 22:20.579
              We met last night
               in a blackout.

22:20.656 --> 22:23.248
     No, we didn't.
The lights were totally on.

22:23.325 --> 22:25.509
          Girl, you invited
       your hookup to brunch?

22:25.586 --> 22:28.237
            Oh no.
     I did no such thing.

22:28.239 --> 22:29.421
            Chick will not
           leave me alone.

22:29.498 --> 22:31.349
        Hello.

22:31.425 --> 22:33.017
      Hi, new friends.
    I'm Eve. I'm a doll.

22:33.094 --> 22:36.169
Wow. People don't usually
introduce themselves like that

22:36.247 --> 22:37.913
    but... okay.

22:37.915 --> 22:40.749
         Uh, what's happening?
         What's going on here

22:40.751 --> 22:41.934
                  on your body?

22:42.010 --> 22:45.270
This is my evening wear look.

22:45.347 --> 22:46.313
                      Oh!
                  (chuckles)

22:48.442 --> 22:48.866
              Yet it's daytime.

22:50.185 --> 22:50.701
       Butler: I like it.

22:52.354 --> 22:53.612
      Waiter: Here you go.

22:53.689 --> 22:58.358
Oh! I'm gonna need, like,
six more of these... stat.

22:58.436 --> 22:59.768
        I'm afraid I can't
      bring you another one

22:59.770 --> 23:00.744
            till you finish
              that one.

23:00.821 --> 23:01.328
           -So...
         -Oh, yeah.

23:10.038 --> 23:10.754
                          Okay.

23:12.133 --> 23:13.632
       (burps)

23:13.709 --> 23:16.710
           Cool. Uh, can I
         get you anything?

23:16.787 --> 23:17.620
We already ordered.
 Are you hungry?

23:17.622 --> 23:18.804
                    Famished.

23:18.881 --> 23:19.555
      Grace:
Don't encourage her.

23:21.216 --> 23:25.477
 Oh, my gosh. Look at all these
 amazing things to choose from.

23:25.554 --> 23:26.979
              Okay, let's see.
                 Um, okay.

23:27.055 --> 23:28.464
          I'm gonna start
      with the French toast.

23:28.466 --> 23:29.573
           -Okay.
         -And then

23:29.650 --> 23:31.075
       the chicken and waffles.

23:31.152 --> 23:32.818
  And after that,
I'm gonna have the frittata.

23:32.895 --> 23:34.319
       That's fun to say.

23:34.396 --> 23:35.971
Frittata. Frittata.

23:35.973 --> 23:36.363
                   Ta-ta-ta.

23:38.309 --> 23:39.250
           (giggles)

23:39.326 --> 23:42.235
          And then I'm gonna do
              the hoecakes

23:42.313 --> 23:44.830
          and the hush puppies?

23:44.907 --> 23:45.998
         -Hush puppies.
           -Puppies?

23:46.074 --> 23:47.425
   Woof!
(growling)

23:47.501 --> 23:50.669
      -Did she just bark?
      -Uh, is that all?

23:50.746 --> 23:52.579
     Heck no. Mm-mm.
Just getting started. Okay.

23:52.657 --> 23:54.339
           Also do the biscuits
                and gravy.

23:54.416 --> 23:55.674
            Lotta gravy. Lotta,
           lotta, lotta gravy.

23:55.751 --> 23:59.603
  Oh. And do you have butter?

24:02.500 --> 24:03.098
Yeah. We have butter.

24:05.670 --> 24:07.060
           (squeals)

24:10.007 --> 24:11.932
    Mmm.

24:12.009 --> 24:13.901
        Mmm. Mmm.

24:16.438 --> 24:17.288
        Mmm. Mmm.

24:21.109 --> 24:22.576
        Mmm! Mm.

24:24.355 --> 24:26.464
       Mmm. Mmm!

24:26.540 --> 24:27.372
  Mmm!

24:35.457 --> 24:37.132
     -Butler: Damn.
 -That's liquid butter.

24:39.294 --> 24:40.961
                  Do you care?

24:41.038 --> 24:42.963
Butler: Apparently,
   she doesn't.

24:43.040 --> 24:44.982
             -Ah!
            -Hey.

24:45.059 --> 24:47.300
      I'm Hyde Owens.
Owner and head chef here.

24:47.378 --> 24:49.135
      I had to come by
     and compliment you

24:49.213 --> 24:50.379
   on your impressive order.

24:50.381 --> 24:52.881
                  Mmm. Mm.

24:52.883 --> 24:55.067
       Everything is delicious.

24:55.143 --> 24:56.142
             You know, you are
           a really good cook,

24:56.220 --> 24:57.386
          -Chef Hyde.
         -Thank you.

24:57.388 --> 25:00.906
        Your mommy and daddy
      must be so proud of you.

25:00.983 --> 25:03.501
   She is so weird.
     I love her.

25:03.577 --> 25:05.561
   Let me know if you need
    anything else, okay?

25:05.563 --> 25:07.171
  Wanna make sure
you're completely satisfied.

25:07.248 --> 25:09.006
Eve: I wanna make sure
  you're completely
satisfied too, Chef Hyde.

25:09.083 --> 25:12.084
      So let me know if there's
     anything I can do for you.

25:16.924 --> 25:19.666
                   Wow!

25:19.744 --> 25:21.835
               Girl, he likes
                your peaches

25:21.912 --> 25:23.095
             and wants to shake
                 your tree.

25:23.171 --> 25:24.596
           (giggles)

25:24.673 --> 25:26.006
              What Tahlia
           is trying to say

25:26.083 --> 25:28.767
         is that he was totally
           flirting with you.

25:28.844 --> 25:30.027
       -Flirting with me?
       -Tahlia: Oh yeah.

25:30.104 --> 25:32.363
  As in verbally communicating
           the desire

25:32.439 --> 25:33.756
to have romantic relations?

25:33.758 --> 25:35.424
            -Mm-hmm.
             -We--

25:35.426 --> 25:36.441
           Yeah.
   Butter your biscuit.

25:36.518 --> 25:38.035
    That's exactly what I said.

25:38.112 --> 25:38.652
    -Are you gonna eat that?
             -Girl!

25:40.765 --> 25:41.780
      You got a hollow leg
         or something?

25:41.857 --> 25:43.523
   -I do!
-Definitely a hollow head.

25:43.601 --> 25:44.533
     Oh, that too.

25:46.528 --> 25:49.121
   Grace, Butler told me
      about the vote

25:49.197 --> 25:50.606
to discontinue the Eve doll.

25:50.608 --> 25:52.107
     -What's up with that?
            -What?

25:52.109 --> 25:54.701
Geez, what is it with everyone
and that stupid freaking doll?

25:54.779 --> 25:58.371
         Excuse me.
  I'm sitting right here.

25:58.449 --> 26:00.707
         And Eve is not
    a stupid freaking doll.

26:00.785 --> 26:02.618
           Eve is the best doll
            to ever be created

26:02.620 --> 26:04.210
       in the history of dolls.

26:04.288 --> 26:05.804
                  Period.

26:05.881 --> 26:06.897
You are not a part
of this conversation.

26:06.974 --> 26:09.291
Yes, I am.

26:09.293 --> 26:11.126
I can't believe that
you are saying this

26:11.128 --> 26:13.404
after everything that
we have been through, Grace.

26:13.480 --> 26:15.906
            Eve is just a doll,
             and she's dunzo.

26:15.983 --> 26:18.467
            Buh-bye. Sad story.

26:18.469 --> 26:19.301
       Can we all just move on?

26:19.303 --> 26:21.804
               You know what?
                I need air.

26:21.806 --> 26:23.247
           I'm not exactly sure
                what for,

26:23.324 --> 26:25.741
 but I know that's what people
 say when they need a moment.

26:27.478 --> 26:28.702
  Please don't come back.

26:31.165 --> 26:32.581
        (keypad beeping)

26:35.669 --> 26:38.170
        Eve A4618 here.

26:38.246 --> 26:39.746
      How's it going
    with Gracie Girl?

26:39.824 --> 26:41.840
       Eve: <i> Not great.</i>
      <i> Not great at all.</i>

26:41.917 --> 26:45.177
     Marathon Toys is going
        to discontinue--

26:45.253 --> 26:47.253
 now that means not continue--
    to make the Eve doll.

26:47.331 --> 26:49.665
        Oh, this is bad.
           Very bad.

26:49.667 --> 26:50.682
     This is the most bad.

26:50.759 --> 26:52.768
        (man beatboxing)

26:54.855 --> 26:56.171
This man is, like, making

26:56.173 --> 26:57.506
     <i> really strange noises</i>
        <i> with his mouth.</i>

26:57.508 --> 26:58.431
       <i> Hang on a second.</i>

26:58.509 --> 26:59.783
     (continues beatboxing)

26:59.860 --> 27:01.026
     Hippity-Hop Eve
  told me about this.

27:05.866 --> 27:08.274
 ¶ I'm cruising down the ocean
in my fly fly yachty yachty ¶

27:08.352 --> 27:09.351
        -Yeah.
   -You like that?

27:09.353 --> 27:12.112
             Yeah, yeah. Now...

27:12.189 --> 27:13.413
       -Oh, oh.
  -How about you...

27:15.860 --> 27:17.468
        -Ha-ha!
   -Eee! (giggles)

27:20.030 --> 27:21.955
            This is fake, man.
             This ain't real.

27:22.032 --> 27:23.866
Yes, it is.

27:23.868 --> 27:24.791
               This ain't real.

27:24.869 --> 27:26.535
               I'm not fake.
                I'm real.

27:26.537 --> 27:27.811
   Gracie brought me to life.

27:27.888 --> 27:28.812
       Eve A4618:
   <i> Eve, come on now.</i>

27:28.889 --> 27:30.463
     <i> -Get back. Come back.</i>
            <i> </i> -Yeah.

27:30.541 --> 27:32.799
  Listen to me very carefully.

27:32.877 --> 27:35.043
 <i> If Eve is discontinued,</i>

27:35.045 --> 27:37.062
all of us-- you, me,
all of the Eve dolls--

27:37.139 --> 27:39.231
will no longer exist.

27:39.307 --> 27:39.481
        My tummy hurts.

27:41.051 --> 27:44.161
I don't think I can do this.
And you were wrong about butter.

27:44.238 --> 27:45.237
  Well, how much did you eat?

27:45.313 --> 27:47.739
    You know what?
Forget about the butter.

27:47.816 --> 27:49.224
      <i> Now, you went there</i>
        <i> to help Grace.</i>

27:49.226 --> 27:53.061
 But in the process, oh,
you have to save the Eve doll.

27:53.063 --> 27:56.507
Now, do you remember
when little Casey lost her mama.

27:56.583 --> 27:58.175
   Did I throw in the towel?

27:58.252 --> 27:59.659
 No, I didn't.

27:59.737 --> 28:01.236
I shined bright.
 I shined far.

28:01.238 --> 28:02.996
I was a star!

28:03.073 --> 28:04.589
     I am rooting for you.

28:04.666 --> 28:05.683
  We are all rooting for you.

28:05.759 --> 28:07.500
  How dare you doubt yourself!

28:07.578 --> 28:09.836
       (computer beeping)

28:09.914 --> 28:12.839
  You are our only hope, Eve.

28:12.917 --> 28:16.585
 Every time you get bucked off,
 you've gotta pick yourself up

28:16.587 --> 28:18.086
  by the bootstraps
and get back in the saddle.

28:18.088 --> 28:21.256
    Cowgirl! Oh, now I smell
      what you're cookin'.

28:21.258 --> 28:22.090
  Oh, that means I understand.

28:22.092 --> 28:23.775
           Good!

28:23.852 --> 28:26.094
 Because time is running out

28:26.096 --> 28:27.362
         and then poof.

28:28.933 --> 28:29.856
          We're gone.

28:29.934 --> 28:30.657
       Just like that?

28:32.694 --> 28:34.119
       Is that really how
       it's gonna happen?

28:34.196 --> 28:35.713
      Pssh. I don't know.
        Nobody knows.

28:35.789 --> 28:38.531
   You just need to make sure
     that Grace understands

28:38.609 --> 28:40.533
     what an important part
       the Eve doll plays

28:40.611 --> 28:42.553
    in the lives of children
          everywhere.

28:42.629 --> 28:45.280
   <i> You only have four days.</i>

28:45.282 --> 28:48.116
   And if you do not reverse
         that spell,

28:48.118 --> 28:50.802
   you cannot come back home
        to Sunnyvale.

28:50.879 --> 28:52.212
        -Ever.
  -Eve: <i> Copy that.</i>

28:52.289 --> 28:56.233
 Four days, reverse the spell,
     save our Sunnyvale.

28:56.310 --> 28:57.976
  You know what? You can trust
    that Eve is on the case.

28:58.053 --> 28:58.736
          I gotta go.

29:03.133 --> 29:05.192
Here are your notes
from your call with Eve, Eve.

29:09.640 --> 29:11.139
      Great job, Secretary Eve.

29:11.141 --> 29:11.782
What would you do
without me? (giggles)

29:20.150 --> 29:20.749
        Gracie Girl.

29:22.336 --> 29:23.576
       Gracie Girl.

29:23.654 --> 29:25.212
Great.
You're still here.

29:29.918 --> 29:31.602
    (grunts)

29:31.678 --> 29:33.437
     -Grace, are you okay?
       -(laughs wildly)

29:35.666 --> 29:36.607
      Woman::
That's Grace Martin.

29:36.683 --> 29:38.517
              Hey!

29:38.593 --> 29:40.002
    Delete that, stupid cow!
          Delete that!

29:40.004 --> 29:40.852
      -Give me that. Hey.
         -Easy. Easy.

29:40.929 --> 29:42.187
         What happened?
         Are you okay?

29:42.264 --> 29:45.007
       -Butler: Of course
        there's cameras.
          -Thank you.

29:45.009 --> 29:46.617
You saved me.

29:46.693 --> 29:48.176
             You don't have
              to thank me.

29:48.178 --> 29:49.936
             It's my job
            to save you.

29:50.014 --> 29:51.288
      You're my special friend.

29:51.365 --> 29:54.699
   -Dude, you're super weird.
   -Dude, you're super weird!

29:54.776 --> 29:56.293
  Well, I think
you're both weird, okay?

29:56.370 --> 29:58.353
Well, I guess we got that
    in common then.

29:58.355 --> 30:00.280
             Yeah, we have
           a lot in common,

30:00.357 --> 30:02.207
           like needing to save
              the Eve doll.

30:02.284 --> 30:03.950
Grace: Oh wow.
Here we go again.

30:04.028 --> 30:05.861
 Okay, look, uh,
before we go anywhere else...

30:05.863 --> 30:06.711
    (chuckles) ...girl,
  I need to hook you up.

30:08.532 --> 30:09.881
         -Let's go.
       -Butler: Amen.

30:09.958 --> 30:10.974
 What're you gonna
  hook me up to?

30:11.051 --> 30:11.958
      Here's your purse, honey.

30:12.036 --> 30:12.467
        -Thanks.
    -You're welcome.

30:16.874 --> 30:18.056
          Let's take this
      busted ponytail down.

30:19.877 --> 30:20.725
          -Okay.
       -(clicking)

30:20.802 --> 30:22.894
           (clicking)

30:24.381 --> 30:25.714
               Oh, my God.

30:25.716 --> 30:27.232
           (giggling)

30:31.572 --> 30:33.163
                Damn.

30:33.240 --> 30:36.408
 I wish my hair grew like this.

30:36.484 --> 30:37.984
  Silly. Everybody's hair
     grows like this.

30:38.062 --> 30:39.244
                       Oh.

30:39.321 --> 30:41.321
           -I mean...
              -Ow!

30:41.398 --> 30:42.005
       -I wanna show you.
       -This is a sew-in.

30:44.234 --> 30:45.491
     Let's do this.

31:12.429 --> 31:14.187
  You look amazing.

31:14.264 --> 31:16.781
             Tahlia's famous
          four-strand braids.

31:16.858 --> 31:20.102
   -Grace: Oh!
-Ooh. Very Met Ball 2021.

31:20.104 --> 31:21.436
           Grace:
   You look gorg, but...

31:21.438 --> 31:22.704
        we have one more stop.

31:24.291 --> 31:25.624
Eve: Wow!

31:25.700 --> 31:30.295
This place is strangely
making me feel better already.

31:30.372 --> 31:31.537
It's called
retail therapy, Eve.

31:31.615 --> 31:32.005
        It's a thing.

31:33.617 --> 31:34.382
              Hi, guys.

31:36.120 --> 31:38.787
Carmen said she saw you leave
  around noon with a tall,

31:38.789 --> 31:40.063
pretty lady wearing
 an evening gown.

31:40.140 --> 31:41.790
   It's you. It's Eve.
       It worked.

31:41.792 --> 31:42.807
   The spell worked.

31:42.884 --> 31:44.960
   Grace: Just a new friend.
          Calm down.

31:44.962 --> 31:46.811
        (both laughing)

31:46.888 --> 31:49.222
    All right. All right, guys.
            All right.

31:49.299 --> 31:53.393
              Eve here is in
              desperate need
            of a new wardrobe.

31:53.470 --> 31:54.636
      Eee! Let's do it.

31:54.638 --> 31:55.820
          Undress me!

          Ooh!

32:08.502 --> 32:09.760

        <i> ¶ It's a look,</i>
        <i> It's a look ¶</i>

32:21.089 --> 32:22.422
  <i> ¶ Can you see me?</i>
<i> 'Cause, baby, it's a look ¶</i>

32:22.499 --> 32:23.832
  <i> ¶ Caviar, collard greens ¶</i>

32:23.834 --> 32:26.001
     <i> ¶ I keep it real hood</i>
      <i> in my Prada jeans ¶</i>

32:26.003 --> 32:27.852

      <i> the right beat ¶</i>

32:33.844 --> 32:35.935
  <i> ¶ Brownsville, Bev Hills ¶</i>

      <i> ¶ I be everywhere</i>

32:37.105 --> 32:37.287
     <i> ¶ Baby, it's a look ¶</i>

32:39.683 --> 32:42.534
        <i> ¶ It's a look,</i>
        <i> It's a look ¶</i>

32:42.610 --> 32:44.277
    Butler: Here she comes.
         Oh, my God.

32:44.354 --> 32:46.612
 <i> ¶ 'Cause, baby, it's a look ¶</i>

32:46.690 --> 32:48.281
         -Tahlia: Yeah!
          -(cheering)

32:48.358 --> 32:50.450
      -Check.
-Grace/Butler: Mate.

32:50.527 --> 32:52.285
  That Christian Cowan jacket
        is to die for.

32:52.362 --> 32:54.287
      Oh, stop it.
    You're too kind.

32:54.364 --> 32:56.122
           (gasps)
         Christian!

32:56.200 --> 32:57.307
  Ah! What are you doing here?

32:57.384 --> 32:59.625
   Mwah! Mwah! Stop.

32:59.703 --> 33:00.702
 I thought you were
in Capri for the holidays.

33:00.704 --> 33:03.129
    Just here to do
 a major Lectrets ad.

33:03.207 --> 33:04.723
              Ohh.

33:04.799 --> 33:07.559
          Hi. I'm Eve.

33:07.635 --> 33:08.819
        -I'm a doll.
      -You are a doll.

33:08.895 --> 33:11.804
  And this look is everything.
            Love it!

33:11.882 --> 33:12.439
              Kiss, kiss.

33:13.734 --> 33:14.399
              Oh.

33:16.570 --> 33:16.901
Step back. Just two.

33:18.813 --> 33:21.147
        -Gotta run. Bye.
           -Eve: Bye.

33:21.225 --> 33:23.225
       Mwah, mwah, mwah.

33:23.227 --> 33:24.317
  You know,
I wish I can take

33:24.394 --> 33:25.168
 all of these clothes
  back to Sunnyvale.

33:25.245 --> 33:27.579
     Butler:
That's in Utah, right?

33:27.655 --> 33:28.329
               All right. Fine.

33:30.734 --> 33:31.666
       If you're really
  from Sunnyvale, prove it.

33:48.752 --> 33:49.434
                  Okay.

33:51.772 --> 33:53.679
          Okay, th-- this is,
          this is happening.

33:53.757 --> 33:54.647
What? What is it?
Is it an embarrassing tattoo?

33:58.019 --> 33:59.611
      Grace:
That's not a tattoo.

33:59.687 --> 34:00.278
It's my serial number.

34:02.115 --> 34:03.707
              -A.
             -4.

34:03.784 --> 34:04.824
             -1.
           -1-4.

34:06.270 --> 34:08.603
  How do you know
her serial number?

34:08.605 --> 34:09.862
 Wait. Why do you have
   a serial number?

34:09.940 --> 34:11.773
All Eve dolls have one.

34:11.775 --> 34:13.533
  It's how we prove
we're one of a kind.

34:13.610 --> 34:15.552
       Like I said,
    our spell worked.

34:15.629 --> 34:17.370
                   E-Excuse me?
                   What spell?

34:17.447 --> 34:19.464
              Eve is Eve.

34:19.541 --> 34:21.391
Grace's doll
is now life size.

34:26.456 --> 34:28.123
         You're really
         my Eve doll?

34:28.125 --> 34:29.681
     And you're really
     my Gracie Girl.

34:33.813 --> 34:37.239
  ¶ Dress her up
from her head to her toes ¶

34:37.317 --> 34:41.578
   ¶ On the town, at the mall
    Eve loves high fashion ¶

34:42.973 --> 34:43.580
          It's me.

34:50.480 --> 34:51.980
   Lex: So Grace
picked me up from school,

34:51.982 --> 34:53.072
 and she was like,
the company was in trouble,

34:53.150 --> 34:54.666
   and I was like,
"Grace, the spell book."

34:54.742 --> 34:55.908
              And she was like,
                 "No way,"

34:55.985 --> 34:57.076
                and I was like,
                  Yes way."

34:57.154 --> 34:58.320
     -What spell?
-So we did the spell,

34:58.322 --> 34:59.154
  and then you
magically showed up.

34:59.156 --> 35:01.323
     This is so cool.

35:01.325 --> 35:03.341
          Your total's $12,485.

35:09.499 --> 35:11.591
         Yeah, I don't think
       this is going to work.

35:11.668 --> 35:12.758
 Oh, it works at home
    in Sunnyvale.

35:12.836 --> 35:14.669
                 (chuckles)

35:14.671 --> 35:16.947
     -Card number 1-2-3...
           -Uh-huh.

35:17.023 --> 35:17.614
          -...4-5-6...
             -Yeah.

35:17.691 --> 35:19.950
           Clerk:
         ...7-8-9.

35:20.026 --> 35:21.343
       Expiration date: never.

35:21.345 --> 35:24.012
      Classic.
      (laughs)

35:24.014 --> 35:24.621
          Don't worry about it.
               I got it.

35:28.518 --> 35:29.942
       Oh, Grace.

35:30.020 --> 35:31.686
     It is so important
       to give credit

35:31.688 --> 35:32.129
    where credit is due.

35:34.040 --> 35:35.039
 You're the best friend
 a doll could ask for.

35:37.027 --> 35:37.625
                 (chuckles)
              Okay, let's go.

35:39.696 --> 35:41.379
   Uh, role play.
 It's all the rage.

35:44.626 --> 35:46.368
    -(Grace laughing wildly)
     -Devin: Look at this.

35:46.370 --> 35:47.802
She's like a drunk sorority girl
        at a frat party.

35:50.040 --> 35:51.890
            This company
        has suffered enough.

35:51.966 --> 35:53.316
        Are we supposed
       to just stand by

35:53.393 --> 35:54.317
    and let her take us all
        down with her?

35:54.394 --> 35:55.894
   What are you getting at?

35:55.970 --> 35:58.380
      I've combed through
        her contract.

35:58.382 --> 36:00.640
    And it clearly states
  that a C-class executive

36:00.717 --> 36:02.050
         may be removed
         from the board

36:02.052 --> 36:04.068
       if the members
     unanimously agree

36:04.145 --> 36:06.479
   that the behavior of said
   executive is not aligned

36:06.556 --> 36:07.647
      with the core values
        of the company.

36:07.724 --> 36:09.574
    We ask her to resign?

36:09.651 --> 36:11.651
      No, no, no. We don't
       ask her to resign.

36:11.728 --> 36:12.894
        We force her to resign.

36:12.896 --> 36:14.320
       Come on.

36:14.398 --> 36:16.656
    Grace is smart.

36:16.733 --> 36:17.174
    I know she can do
       this job.

36:19.160 --> 36:20.510
              It's time to take
             back this company.

36:28.670 --> 36:30.595
      (indistinct chatter)

36:35.585 --> 36:38.102
       Damn those little THOTS.

36:38.179 --> 36:39.529
        You know what?
       It's about time

36:39.606 --> 36:41.773
           someone bullied them
            into understanding

36:41.849 --> 36:43.366
         that bullying is not
             the answer.

36:43.443 --> 36:45.276
       I don't even know
  where to begin with that.

36:45.353 --> 36:47.595
  -Let's just stay in the car,
           shall we?
    -Nope, not this time.

36:47.597 --> 36:48.205
       -Oh.
-Sorry, not sorry.

36:52.953 --> 36:53.534
          Yo, Marley?

36:55.105 --> 36:57.029
     Grace, no.

36:57.107 --> 36:58.440
             You got a problem
            with my girl Lex?

36:58.442 --> 37:00.108
            What are you even
          talking about, lady?

37:00.110 --> 37:04.128
         Lady? Oh, no.
         I'm no lady.

37:04.205 --> 37:05.797
I know you and your little
  brat friends over here

37:05.873 --> 37:07.206
  are talking crap about Lex.

37:07.284 --> 37:08.283
                 No, we're not.

37:08.285 --> 37:09.634
          Grace, stop, please.

37:09.711 --> 37:12.303
  Oh, girl, you better hope
 you grow into those feet.

37:12.380 --> 37:15.047
         Ha! And you...

37:15.125 --> 37:16.399
     Grace. Don't say freckles.
        Don't say freckles.

37:16.476 --> 37:18.884
           -Freckles.
           -Oh, my...

37:18.962 --> 37:20.553
      Oh, and you think
    you're off the hook?

37:20.630 --> 37:24.390
   Think again, 'cause you
      look like a boy.

37:24.468 --> 37:26.910
    (clears throat)
    I-I am a boy.

37:26.987 --> 37:28.695
       Wow. Your skin
        is flawless.

37:31.232 --> 37:33.917
             Are you done now,
             humiliating me?

37:33.994 --> 37:35.477
    Humiliating you?
Lex, I am protecting you

37:35.479 --> 37:39.314
   from these horrible tweens
     and their mean words.

37:39.316 --> 37:40.999
      You don't even know
  what you're talking about!

37:41.075 --> 37:42.709
     Wait. Wha-- Lex!

37:45.155 --> 37:46.078
          But you were all just
         talking and laughing.

37:46.156 --> 37:48.414
                Yeah. We're 12.

37:48.492 --> 37:49.173
             We talk and laugh.

37:50.585 --> 37:54.496
 Oh. So you weren't,
you weren't talking about Lex?

37:54.498 --> 37:57.165
               No. We like Lex.

37:57.167 --> 37:59.851
       She taught me
a really cool card trick.

37:59.927 --> 38:01.444
   Yeah. I think
 she's wonderful.

38:01.521 --> 38:03.505
   Because she is wonderful.

38:03.507 --> 38:05.282
        You guys are
       all wonderful.

38:05.358 --> 38:07.342
      You know what?
      Freckles rock.

38:07.344 --> 38:08.901
              ¶ ¶

38:21.282 --> 38:23.115
Lex, come on.

38:23.193 --> 38:25.785
        I'm sorry.

38:25.862 --> 38:27.529
    I thought they were teasing
        and bullying you.

38:27.531 --> 38:30.198
You know, it used to be
really fun hanging out with you.

38:30.200 --> 38:33.643
'Cause you know
what I'm going through.

38:33.720 --> 38:36.479
  It was like having
 a cool older sister.

38:36.556 --> 38:38.315
   But lately,
just not that cool.

38:38.391 --> 38:39.223
            What do you want me
               to do, Lex?

38:41.044 --> 38:42.393
   Forget it.

38:42.470 --> 38:42.935
      I'm out.

38:44.548 --> 38:45.155
She's all yours, Eve.

38:52.739 --> 38:54.280
      (crickets chirping)

39:14.744 --> 39:15.468
       What?

39:18.748 --> 39:19.689
What? Why are you just
sitting there staring at me?

39:21.251 --> 39:21.766
         Are you okay?

39:23.253 --> 39:26.646
'Cause I'm trying to be
the best friend that I know how.

39:29.183 --> 39:30.033
        But you still seem sad.

39:31.611 --> 39:32.276
             All the time.

39:34.264 --> 39:34.529
I hate to break it to you,

39:35.765 --> 39:39.434
but it's gonna take
a whole lot of something

39:39.436 --> 39:42.194
to get me as enthusiastic
     as you are...

39:42.272 --> 39:43.938
  about anything.

39:43.940 --> 39:46.549
    That is not the Gracie Girl
           that I know.

39:46.626 --> 39:47.959
       Or maybe you don't
        really know me.

39:48.035 --> 39:49.877
             I do know you.

39:51.615 --> 39:52.222
             And I'm worried.

39:55.969 --> 39:56.676
    You know what?

39:59.714 --> 40:00.563
 Maybe if my mom
had been around more...

40:04.127 --> 40:05.402
 maybe I wouldn't be
  such a monster.

40:05.478 --> 40:06.227
          You're not a monster.

40:08.298 --> 40:09.239
    I just wanted
   a childhood...

40:11.301 --> 40:11.691
 like the other kids.

40:13.303 --> 40:13.651
You know, sometimes...

40:15.138 --> 40:15.578
I wondered if...

40:17.732 --> 40:18.239
she even wanted me.

40:20.067 --> 40:21.643
              Don't say that.

40:21.645 --> 40:22.493
   And now look.

40:24.481 --> 40:26.164
I have to run
the same damn company

40:26.240 --> 40:26.998
that kept her from me.

40:29.836 --> 40:31.377
How's that... for irony?

40:33.823 --> 40:35.932
      (footsteps receding)

40:43.424 --> 40:45.266
              ¶ ¶

40:53.009 --> 40:54.567
Wake up and pee!
The world's on fire!

40:57.681 --> 40:59.280
What?
That's a saying, right?

41:01.442 --> 41:04.109
               Yeah, my mom
            always said that.

41:04.187 --> 41:05.462
     I know, silly.
      I was there.

41:05.538 --> 41:07.297
                        Oh God.

41:07.373 --> 41:09.040
       It's too early for this.

41:09.116 --> 41:09.874
 I got a big day
planned for us.

41:09.951 --> 41:11.634
  Come on. Let's go.

41:11.711 --> 41:13.027
               No, I have
           a big day planned

41:13.029 --> 41:13.753
        to stay in bed all day.

41:16.049 --> 41:17.381
Hey, Grace. You know,
I was thinking about

41:17.458 --> 41:20.885
what you said yesterday,
about not having a childhood,

41:20.962 --> 41:22.428
and I have
the ultimate solution.

41:24.298 --> 41:26.040
             (groans and sighs)

41:26.042 --> 41:27.967
                   Why are you
                 torturing me?

41:28.044 --> 41:30.320
Oh, come on. Pretty,
pretty, pretty please.

41:30.396 --> 41:31.604
With Georgia
sweet peaches on top.

41:38.145 --> 41:40.830
   (singsongy)
 I have coffee.

41:40.907 --> 41:44.667
Yeah. There she is.

41:44.744 --> 41:45.117
                 Give me that.

41:46.746 --> 41:47.837
Oh, she's taking it.

41:50.066 --> 41:51.824
Yes.

41:51.901 --> 41:53.325
Okay, get dressed, okay.

41:53.403 --> 41:53.918
Wait until you see
    my outfit.

41:57.240 --> 41:57.755
            (scoffs)

42:01.411 --> 42:03.261

42:03.337 --> 42:03.970

The place where ca-rowds go

42:08.601 --> 42:10.843
       ca-razy for Cha-ristmas.

42:10.920 --> 42:12.344
       Like I go crazy for you,
             Gracie Girl.

42:29.939 --> 42:30.496
     Over there.

42:44.454 --> 42:45.344
   Merry Christmas!

42:55.648 --> 42:58.357
    <i> (Deck the Halls </i> playing
         over speaker)

43:03.489 --> 43:05.898
Okay, question. Are were really
 going to sit on Santa's lap?

43:05.975 --> 43:07.475
        Yeah.

43:07.477 --> 43:10.086
How else is he gonna know
what we want for Christmas?

43:10.163 --> 43:10.703
             Okay, it's just...

43:12.332 --> 43:13.739
              a lot has changed
              this past year.

43:13.817 --> 43:17.594
              There's been
           an entire movement
           that suggests that

43:17.670 --> 43:20.763
         two women sitting
     on a powerful man's lap

43:20.840 --> 43:22.414
        as he offers them gifts
            while shouting

43:22.492 --> 43:24.767
              "Ho, ho, ho, ho,"

43:26.587 --> 43:29.088
     it's, it's not exactly PC.

43:29.165 --> 43:30.665
 Actually, it's just
    three "Hos."

43:30.667 --> 43:33.092
Come on, please.

43:33.169 --> 43:33.601
            -Please.
             -Okay.

43:35.262 --> 43:36.279
Come on.

43:36.356 --> 43:37.063
                      Grace.

43:38.432 --> 43:40.617
   Oh, hi.

43:40.693 --> 43:42.693
Calum, right?
It's Jen Chen's boyfriend?

43:42.770 --> 43:44.846
                  Uh, no, no,
                not boyfriend.

43:44.848 --> 43:45.938
               Jen and I
          are just friends.

43:46.015 --> 43:48.366
Oh, I thought
you two were like...

43:48.442 --> 43:50.852
                 We're friends.
                 Just friends.

43:50.854 --> 43:53.445
   Oh, that's good.
      I mean...

43:53.523 --> 43:55.131
Calum, I want you
to meet my friend Eve.

43:55.208 --> 43:56.874
              Best friend.

43:56.951 --> 43:58.283
    You are really handsome.

43:58.361 --> 44:00.862
 It would make a perfect match
     for my Gracie Girl.

44:00.864 --> 44:02.454
           (chuckles)

44:02.532 --> 44:03.306
   She says
weird things a lot.

44:03.383 --> 44:05.642
                   (chuckles)
                   Thank you.

44:05.718 --> 44:07.459
                  Uh, it's nice
                  to meet you,

44:07.537 --> 44:09.095
        Eve, and it's good
     to see you again, Grace.

44:10.464 --> 44:11.055
       You too.

44:13.710 --> 44:15.142
           I guess I better get
           a spot in the line.

44:17.046 --> 44:18.880
Oh, well, um,
I mean, you can

44:18.882 --> 44:19.730
  come hang with us.

44:19.807 --> 44:20.773
   I mean, if you want.
        No presh.

44:22.402 --> 44:24.552
     That means pressure.
       I don't know why
    I just shortened that.

44:24.554 --> 44:26.904
            (laughs)

44:26.981 --> 44:27.830
       -Calum: Yeah.
    -(Grace chuckles)

44:29.392 --> 44:32.835
     Look at her. She's so cute
      and so happy and playing

44:32.912 --> 44:35.746
             with her Eve doll.

44:35.823 --> 44:37.899
           Hey, uh, Emma.
       Come meet my friends.

44:37.901 --> 44:38.341
Oh, you know her?

44:40.253 --> 44:42.327
               Yeah, she's
           my little sister.

44:42.405 --> 44:43.571
               What, you think
             I was a grown man

44:43.573 --> 44:43.846
     come to sit on Santa's lap
            by himself?

44:45.909 --> 44:47.517
I mean, to be honest, yeah,
and I was slightly concerned.

44:50.246 --> 44:52.580
           Emma, this is Grace,
             and this is Eve.

44:52.582 --> 44:54.432
     That's my doll's name.

44:54.508 --> 44:57.694
            I know.
       I know her well.

44:57.770 --> 44:59.587
             Did you know,
              Emma, that

44:59.589 --> 45:02.181
          Grace's company makes
             the Eve doll?

45:02.258 --> 45:07.019
     And, Emma, don't you just
   love your Eve doll so much.

45:07.096 --> 45:08.871
  Wait, you make the Eve doll.
       Th-That's so cool.

45:08.948 --> 45:12.433
  Is it true that
if you ask your Eve doll

45:12.435 --> 45:14.435
       for help with something,

45:14.437 --> 45:15.536
         she can magically make
         everything all right?

45:17.123 --> 45:17.830
Uh-huh.

45:19.867 --> 45:21.167
Yeah, no, it is true.

45:22.779 --> 45:23.210
     You know, Emma...

45:24.872 --> 45:26.705
  you may not notice

45:26.783 --> 45:29.225
 that any magic is happening
      in that moment,

45:29.302 --> 45:32.970
but in time, you'll see
  that your Eve doll

45:33.047 --> 45:34.731
made everything just right.

45:37.627 --> 45:40.294
     Emma, I think we need
       something hot...

45:40.296 --> 45:41.312
           chocolate.

45:41.388 --> 45:43.297
        But not too hot.

45:43.299 --> 45:44.741
       -Right? (giggles)
            -Yeah.

45:44.817 --> 45:45.742
Wanna get out of here?

45:45.818 --> 45:47.226
           -Can I?
         -Go ahead.

45:47.303 --> 45:48.411
                Come on.

45:48.488 --> 45:49.570
          -Bye!
      -Calum: Bye.

45:52.233 --> 45:53.532
      (laughs)

46:03.653 --> 46:05.094
           Hey, it's you again.

46:05.171 --> 46:07.321
Hi. And it's you again.

46:07.323 --> 46:09.081
We'll have four
hot chocolates.

46:09.158 --> 46:12.510
And I'm gonna immediately
begin flirting with you
 in three, two, one.

46:12.586 --> 46:16.497
Your eyelashes are as long
   as peacock feathers,

46:16.499 --> 46:19.091
and your smile shines
so bright and so far.

46:19.168 --> 46:20.425
   And your pecs,

46:20.503 --> 46:24.171
they look as delicious
as your juicy chicken tastes.

46:24.173 --> 46:26.440
            Wow. I've never met
            a woman like you.

46:28.678 --> 46:30.602
 You say exactly what you want
       no matter what.

46:30.680 --> 46:32.288
Oh, I like you, Chef Hyde.

46:32.365 --> 46:33.514
       (whispers)
         A lot.

46:33.516 --> 46:36.033
        I really like you, Eve.

46:36.110 --> 46:37.868
    You're truly one of a kind.

46:37.945 --> 46:38.961
                You're a doll.

46:39.038 --> 46:42.114
        Ha. I am, yes.
          Yes, I am.

46:42.191 --> 46:43.040
           (laughing)

46:45.528 --> 46:45.802
           I'm gonna get
      those hot chocolates.

46:52.718 --> 46:55.386
That was really sweet
what you said to my sister.

46:55.462 --> 46:57.371
     She's going through
   a rough time right now

46:57.373 --> 46:58.797
   with our parents' divorce.

46:58.875 --> 47:01.133
            Oh, wow, I'm sorry.

47:01.210 --> 47:03.468
      Yeah, no, she's,
 she's a really sweet girl.

47:03.546 --> 47:04.436
            -She is.
             -Yeah.

47:10.053 --> 47:11.719
      I am... I'm glad
    I ran into you again

47:11.721 --> 47:12.903
         after your...

47:12.980 --> 47:15.072
            Oh, gosh. The luau?

47:15.149 --> 47:16.907
      -Yeah.
-Oh wow. I'm sorry.

47:16.984 --> 47:18.984
        I was a lot that day.

47:19.062 --> 47:19.985
No. What? No.
You were amazing.

47:20.063 --> 47:22.079
      You were the life
       of the party.

47:22.156 --> 47:22.988
   I wish I looked that good
      in a grass skirt.

47:23.066 --> 47:24.081
                 Oh gosh. Stop.

47:24.158 --> 47:25.916
     No, it was amazing.
       On the table.

47:25.993 --> 47:26.843
          -Wow.
      -(laughing)

47:26.919 --> 47:28.235
       -I'm embarrassed.
         -(laughing)

47:28.237 --> 47:31.906
 -Thank you. No...
-Don't be. It was impressive.

47:31.908 --> 47:33.741
      I-I'm going through
  a lot of stress right now,

47:33.743 --> 47:34.925
       -and that day,
     I just felt like--
      -No, no, don't--

47:36.412 --> 47:38.596
  Everybody has stuff
going on in their lives

47:38.672 --> 47:39.021
 that no one else
can possibly understand.

47:40.507 --> 47:42.099
     Wow. Ain't that the truth.

47:45.755 --> 47:46.353
    -Say cheese!
-(camera shutter clicks)

47:55.264 --> 47:56.363
    Okay!

47:58.601 --> 47:59.992
    (Christmas hip-hop music
            playing)

48:05.108 --> 48:06.774
          Oh, no, no. We don't,
          we don't eat those.

48:06.776 --> 48:09.126
  It used to be that you would
     just come to the mall

48:09.203 --> 48:10.869
        to sit on Santa's lap,
             and now it's

48:10.947 --> 48:11.962
   this whole experience.

48:12.039 --> 48:13.280
      Eve: (on microphone)
         <i> Hi, everyone.</i>

48:13.282 --> 48:15.558
    <i> I hope you're having</i>
  <i> a marvelous time today</i>

48:16.210 --> 48:17.301
         <i> I know I am.</i>

48:17.378 --> 48:20.062
Oh, good God. Someone
gave her a microphone.

            <i> I want to give</i>
         <i> a special shout-out</i>

-(song continues, indistinct)

48:52.338 --> 48:55.097
It's our old commercial jingle
      for the Eve doll.

        ¶ Where you are
         be a star ¶

48:58.327 --> 49:00.585
 ¶ Shine bright, shine far... ¶

49:00.663 --> 49:01.495
  Yeah, I know.
It's a little out of date.

49:01.497 --> 49:02.763
           (laughing)

49:04.758 --> 49:05.942
        You know I'm
  a music producer, right?

49:06.018 --> 49:07.443
        -Are you really?
            -Mm-hmm.

49:07.520 --> 49:09.094
   No, I didn't know that.

49:09.172 --> 49:10.595
        It's cool.

       completely sworn off

        where you are ¶

49:45.391 --> 49:46.540
 Yo, what is happening
     over there?

49:46.542 --> 49:49.210
This place is insane.

49:49.212 --> 49:49.768
             Yeah.

49:52.231 --> 49:53.714
                       Uh-huh.

49:53.716 --> 49:54.273
      What?

49:55.718 --> 49:58.177
             Ah.

49:58.254 --> 49:59.644
                  Uh, you know,
                  funny story,

49:59.722 --> 50:02.406
 my grandpa used to say that
there was magic in mistletoe.

50:05.061 --> 50:06.669
      That's interesting.
          (laughing)

50:09.398 --> 50:12.066
I guess, I guess we're supposed
    to kiss or something.

50:12.068 --> 50:14.510

50:20.243 --> 50:21.341
         I have to go.

50:24.413 --> 50:25.929
Yeah, I'm sorry.
 I have to go.

50:26.006 --> 50:27.581
                    Yeah, um...

50:27.583 --> 50:28.357
     -Yeah, I have stuff...
             -Sure.

50:28.434 --> 50:30.768
       -...that I work...
             -Yeah.

50:30.844 --> 50:32.436
...and, uh...
  Uh-huh.

50:32.513 --> 50:34.196
           Well, you know what?

50:34.273 --> 50:35.773
          Maybe we'll bump
       into each other again.

50:35.849 --> 50:38.534
          Or... can I just take
              your number?

50:38.611 --> 50:40.261
   Yeah! Yeah, no,
   let's do that.

50:40.263 --> 50:43.113
Um, Jen Chen has it, so...

50:43.190 --> 50:44.707
Yeah, just ask her and...

50:44.784 --> 50:46.283
         Yeah, we'll talk. Eve?

50:46.360 --> 50:47.710
            (sighs)

50:47.787 --> 50:48.160
       Grace:
 Eve, we gotta go.

50:51.198 --> 50:51.538
          Will I see you again?

50:55.278 --> 50:55.876
 Certainly hope so.

51:00.783 --> 51:03.467
You smell good enough to eat.

51:03.544 --> 51:05.227
         Way too soon.
         We gotta go.

51:05.304 --> 51:06.562
        I want you to be
    my extra special friend.

51:09.292 --> 51:10.066
              Bye!

51:16.465 --> 51:17.889
What is this funny feeling
       in my tummy?

51:17.967 --> 51:19.391
(sighs)

51:19.468 --> 51:21.744
It's like there's butterflies,
like, flying around in there.

51:25.141 --> 51:26.824
I'm really warm.

51:26.900 --> 51:29.067
Like, really warm.

51:29.145 --> 51:31.370
          (singsongy)
    I think you might have
    a crush on Chef Hyde.

51:34.150 --> 51:35.816
  I can't stop smiling
when I think about him.

51:35.818 --> 51:38.319
    And I can't stop
  thinking about him.

51:38.321 --> 51:39.837
 Which means
I can't stop smiling.

51:39.913 --> 51:42.431
          Just be careful, Eve.

51:42.508 --> 51:43.991
          Love has way of
      letting you down hard.

51:43.993 --> 51:45.884
      Tahlia:
Holy Christmas tree!

51:47.830 --> 51:49.254
No wonder
you called us over.

51:49.332 --> 51:50.439
    Pretty impressive, huh?

51:50.516 --> 51:52.015
           We make a good team.

51:52.092 --> 51:53.925
          You never get a tree.

51:54.003 --> 51:56.261
I decided it's time
 to change that.

51:56.339 --> 51:59.173
     Oh, my gosh. Eve and I
     had the greatest day.

51:59.175 --> 51:59.940
   We went to Christmasmania.

52:02.178 --> 52:03.510
            -What?
           -I know.

52:03.512 --> 52:04.436
            I'll never be
         caught dead there,

52:04.513 --> 52:07.957
            but it was actually
               really fun.

52:08.033 --> 52:09.608
             Doing, like,
         the simplest things

52:09.685 --> 52:11.685
 like riding the kiddie train.

52:11.687 --> 52:13.796
        You didn't post
   on Instagram once today.

52:13.873 --> 52:15.372
        -(gasps)
    -Grace: I know.

52:15.449 --> 52:16.707
I was just living in the moment.
         It was like...

52:18.527 --> 52:19.084
being a kid again.

52:24.625 --> 52:25.090
You know what?

52:26.960 --> 52:28.051
 The tree's missing something.

52:28.128 --> 52:28.886
          Hang on.

52:36.729 --> 52:39.471
         (both gasping)

52:39.548 --> 52:41.306
                Special Edition
                Christmas Eve.

52:41.384 --> 52:43.108
         -Yeah.
     -Oh, my gosh.

52:44.645 --> 52:45.327
                        Lex.

52:48.391 --> 52:48.998
                   Could you do
                   the honors?

52:51.151 --> 52:52.284
  Oh, it really is
 a beautiful tree.

52:55.731 --> 52:56.747
     This mean you're not
      mad at me anymore?

52:56.823 --> 52:58.841
I'm working on it.

52:58.918 --> 53:00.584
          Okay. I'll take it.

53:00.661 --> 53:01.177
        Go ahead.

53:23.850 --> 53:25.484
(gasps) Oh, my gosh.
I remember this day.

53:29.281 --> 53:30.206
Your mom sent us
to that kiddie camp.

53:32.693 --> 53:34.601
Look at that cute kid.
   I die. I'm dead.

53:34.603 --> 53:36.937
          No, that was actually

53:36.939 --> 53:38.380
  the opening of
Marathon Toy Store downtown.

53:38.457 --> 53:41.050
And I was there.

53:41.126 --> 53:43.610
  She is right.
Look at your Eve doll.

53:43.612 --> 53:44.544
     She was my special friend.

53:46.799 --> 53:47.631
                She still is.

53:59.144 --> 54:01.478
     Oh, you guys are good.

54:01.555 --> 54:06.133
     (overlapping chatter)

54:06.135 --> 54:08.802
         Guys, guys,
       listen to me.

54:08.804 --> 54:12.806
  Look, I would love to find
 a way to save the Eve doll.

54:12.808 --> 54:15.476
 And maybe saving the Eve doll
    could save the store,

54:15.478 --> 54:20.814
   but... the fact is
 the online market has
changed the toy industry.

54:20.816 --> 54:23.484
            Look, the store,
             the Eve doll,

54:23.486 --> 54:26.762
  I'm sorry, but they're just
   casualties of the times.

54:26.839 --> 54:30.157
  So what? Times
and people are changing.

54:30.159 --> 54:30.766
 Shouldn't the Eve doll
   change with them?

54:33.420 --> 54:35.496
   -Tahlia: Hello.
-Butler: That's right now.

54:35.498 --> 54:36.346
           Give the kids
         what they want.

54:38.334 --> 54:39.424
                   Oh, my gosh.

54:39.502 --> 54:40.559
        It's so simple.

54:42.004 --> 54:46.356
Lex, you just might be
the smartest kid I've ever met.

54:46.433 --> 54:47.783
                  Okay, listen.

54:47.860 --> 54:50.844
Do you think your friends
from school would be interested

54:50.846 --> 54:52.012
       in taking part
 in a creative brainstorm?

54:52.014 --> 54:55.624
  I mean, I can ask.

54:55.701 --> 54:57.351
  Lex, I wanna do it tonight.

54:57.353 --> 54:58.685
        -Really?
    -Grace: Mm-hmm.

54:58.687 --> 55:00.462
             I'll call everyone
                  I know!

55:00.539 --> 55:02.189
  (singing)
Let's have a slumber party!

55:02.191 --> 55:03.632
        -Slumber party.
        -Butler: Yes!

55:03.709 --> 55:06.117
   -Yes!
-(all shouting excitedly)

55:06.195 --> 55:07.970
Here we come!

55:08.047 --> 55:10.139
                   Yes!

55:10.215 --> 55:11.882
 Wait, what's a slumber party?

55:11.958 --> 55:14.051
      We'll explain later!

55:14.127 --> 55:15.978
    (all shouting excitedly)

55:18.131 --> 55:18.764
            All in favor?

55:31.387 --> 55:31.476
                 Devin:
            It's unanimous.

55:32.888 --> 55:35.447
     Thank you, all.
   This was the right
      thing to do.

55:41.564 --> 55:41.953
      Thank you for being
       a part of this.

55:47.086 --> 55:47.626
                 Carter.

55:49.254 --> 55:49.845
    This is a huge mistake.

56:01.917 --> 56:04.768
Yeah, it was close, but we
finally got Carter on board.

56:06.105 --> 56:08.530
Yeah, I'm just glad
it worked out with the voting.

56:08.607 --> 56:10.181
I'd hate to have
to get rid of Grace

56:10.259 --> 56:11.533
the same way I got rid
    of her mother.

56:11.610 --> 56:12.192
   (chuckles)

56:16.615 --> 56:19.190
    Sushi and Poke bowls?

56:19.268 --> 56:20.951
     These kids are 12.

56:21.027 --> 56:22.452
             Trust me, they are
               going to love.

56:22.529 --> 56:25.288
I have the pizza hookup
if it all goes south.

56:25.365 --> 56:26.215
  Just saying.

56:26.291 --> 56:28.050
        (doorbell rings)

56:28.127 --> 56:30.368
        Are we expecting more?

56:30.446 --> 56:31.461
            -Mm-mm.
            -Mmm.

56:31.538 --> 56:31.962
          I'll get it.

56:36.135 --> 56:37.951
              Hi.

56:37.953 --> 56:38.877
         -Calum: Hello.
              -Hi.

56:38.954 --> 56:41.230
                    You must be
                   Emma, right?

56:41.306 --> 56:42.564
Come on in.
It's gonna be amazing.

56:42.641 --> 56:43.807
          -Bye, Calum.
             -Bye.

56:43.884 --> 56:44.558
                   Be good.

56:46.553 --> 56:47.719
        I didn't know
      you were coming.

56:47.796 --> 56:50.130
             Uh, Eve called me.

56:50.132 --> 56:52.149
  Of course she did.

56:52.225 --> 56:54.025
    I mean, I...
 I'm glad she did.

56:57.230 --> 57:01.825
  Um... I-I guess I'll be back
      in the morning, then

57:01.902 --> 57:02.200
               to pick up Emma?

57:03.479 --> 57:06.255
Oh. Okay, yeah.
No, that-that's totally fine.

57:06.331 --> 57:08.832
                    Unless...

57:08.909 --> 57:10.426
 I mean, if you need
someone else for a sleepover,

57:10.502 --> 57:11.042
       I could do a really good
            French braid.

57:12.821 --> 57:13.762
        Uh...

57:13.839 --> 57:15.580
           (laughing)

57:15.658 --> 57:18.082
 (laughing)

57:18.160 --> 57:18.600
              No, okay, I'll...

57:21.330 --> 57:21.595
         I'll see you tomorrow.

57:22.998 --> 57:23.605
        Okay.

57:25.167 --> 57:25.765
       Okay, bye.

57:27.427 --> 57:27.934
     Mm-hmm.

57:32.766 --> 57:33.282
            (sighs)

57:36.011 --> 57:40.238
  Grace: Um, I know I owe
all of you an apology, so...

57:42.367 --> 57:43.850
       I'm really sorry.

57:43.852 --> 57:45.944
       Um, as many of you know,

57:46.021 --> 57:48.297
           I own a toy company,

57:48.373 --> 57:49.206
   and we make the Eve doll.

57:50.617 --> 57:51.208
                        Well...

57:52.695 --> 57:55.712
      things haven't been going
          so well lately,

57:55.789 --> 57:57.455
         and we really need
       to make some changes.

57:57.533 --> 57:57.973
                          So...

57:59.960 --> 58:02.719
           right now
    at Marathon Toys, um,

58:02.796 --> 58:04.813
    what we were thinking was--

58:04.890 --> 58:06.982
  Grace, why don't I
  take it from here?

58:08.393 --> 58:08.934
                 Okay.

58:12.214 --> 58:14.472
           -Hi, guys.
           -Kids: Hi.

58:14.550 --> 58:18.827
    Essentially, we get to help
    make the Eve doll cooler.

58:18.904 --> 58:21.238
    More representative
   of the kids we know.

58:21.314 --> 58:24.833
       And in return, we get
    to eat lots of yummy food

58:24.910 --> 58:27.819
drink caffeine, stay up late,
and watch YouTube slime videos.

58:27.896 --> 58:29.412
           Kids: Oh!

58:29.489 --> 58:32.174
           The current Eve doll
             looks like this.

58:32.251 --> 58:33.959
 And here she is with part one
       of the makeover.

58:36.739 --> 58:38.255
      -Tahlia: Wow!
  -Girl: Oh, my gosh.

58:38.331 --> 58:39.406
      Is she real?

58:39.408 --> 58:41.424
             -Yup.
            -Okay.

58:41.501 --> 58:43.093
         Now don't go crazy,
             everyone.

58:43.169 --> 58:45.428
 Um, this is
my friend Eve,

58:45.505 --> 58:49.416
and she just, she happens
to look a lot like the Eve doll.

58:49.418 --> 58:50.675
             Hi, everybody.

58:50.753 --> 58:52.010
           Kids: Hi!

58:52.087 --> 58:55.680
     I'm so excited to hang out
       with you guys tonight,

58:55.758 --> 58:58.108
         and, uh, this is
     my first slumber party.

58:58.184 --> 59:02.262
        -Oh. Oh!
    -(kids giggling)

59:02.264 --> 59:03.539
              Lex:
       Like I was saying,

59:03.615 --> 59:07.617
the current Eve doll,
though very pretty and polished,

59:07.694 --> 59:09.861
 is limited with just a handful
       of outfit options.

59:09.938 --> 59:11.605
Eve's list of careers are short

59:11.607 --> 59:12.956
        and uninspired.

59:13.033 --> 59:14.532
              Bridal Eve.

59:14.610 --> 59:15.942
        It's not even a career.

59:15.944 --> 59:19.704
   Beauty Pageant Eve, well,
   it's just sad actually.

59:19.782 --> 59:21.557
        But we're taught
         we can grow up

59:21.633 --> 59:22.707
       to be anything
     we dream of being.

59:22.785 --> 59:25.952
         (all cheering)

59:25.954 --> 59:26.728
         Let's do this!

59:26.805 --> 59:29.547
      (shouting excitedly)

59:29.625 --> 59:31.725
              ¶ ¶

59:47.309 --> 59:48.992
     (dance music playing)

01:00:16.004 --> 01:00:17.270
    -(hip-hop music playing)
        -(all shouting)

01:00:39.285 --> 01:00:41.086
    (indistinct whispering)

01:00:45.701 --> 01:00:46.800
              -Oh.
              -Hi.

01:00:49.371 --> 01:00:50.261
  You knew I never had
a slumber party growing up.

01:00:51.631 --> 01:00:52.263
         Not one.

01:00:54.393 --> 01:00:57.727
         I was born a grownup,
        so I've never had one.

01:00:57.804 --> 01:00:59.470
    But I know
this one was good!

01:00:59.548 --> 01:01:01.882
    Where is everyone?

01:01:01.884 --> 01:01:02.899
         Tahlia: Oh, uh,
    most went home already.

01:01:02.976 --> 01:01:04.401
       -(doorbell rings)
         -(both gasp)

01:01:04.477 --> 01:01:05.994
             That must be Calum
            to be pick up Emma.

01:01:06.071 --> 01:01:07.053
        -(Emma giggles)
            -What?

01:01:07.055 --> 01:01:08.497
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, no, wait.

01:01:08.573 --> 01:01:09.665
   Don't open that door. No!

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:10.240
           Don't op--

01:01:12.728 --> 01:01:15.228
   -Hi, Calum.
-Calum: (laughing) Hi. Hi.

01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:17.989
           I, uh, brought
        a little pick-me-up

01:01:18.066 --> 01:01:19.249
         in case you needed it
        after the wild night.

01:01:19.325 --> 01:01:21.067
Grace:
Oh wow.

01:01:21.069 --> 01:01:23.327
  Thank you. That was
really thoughtful of you.

01:01:23.405 --> 01:01:26.831
              Such a gentleman.
             I will take that.

01:01:26.909 --> 01:01:29.092
   -Thank you.
-Oh, okay. You're welcome.

01:01:31.413 --> 01:01:33.004
      That's, that's cute hair.

01:01:33.081 --> 01:01:33.596
              Oh.

01:01:35.417 --> 01:01:36.692
         -I don't know.
          -(all laugh)

01:01:36.768 --> 01:01:37.675
            So, how did it go?

01:01:37.753 --> 01:01:38.843
                   So fun.

01:01:38.921 --> 01:01:39.695
Can we do it again
  next weekend?

01:01:39.771 --> 01:01:41.363
Please say yes.
Please say yes.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.347
                 I don't know.
                   Can we?

01:01:43.425 --> 01:01:47.277
   Oh, yes. She can do it
 again and again and again.

01:01:47.353 --> 01:01:49.738
        Yeah, Eve. Um...

01:01:49.814 --> 01:01:51.540
 I'm sure we can
arrange something.

01:01:51.616 --> 01:01:53.283
                          Okay.

01:01:53.359 --> 01:01:56.119
           Well, you know, uh,
           this is my number

01:01:56.196 --> 01:01:58.163
 in case you want
to call me yourself next time.

01:01:59.458 --> 01:02:00.165
       Right.

01:02:03.278 --> 01:02:03.835
      Thank you.

01:02:06.539 --> 01:02:07.338
          -Emma.
       -Emma, uh--

01:02:08.467 --> 01:02:09.215
               We should go.

01:02:11.286 --> 01:02:12.376
   Bye, Emma.

01:02:12.454 --> 01:02:12.844
              Give me a hug.

01:02:14.957 --> 01:02:15.972
             -Bye.
            -Bye.

01:02:16.049 --> 01:02:16.347
          -Bye, Emma.
            -Bye.

01:02:17.809 --> 01:02:19.735
        All: Bye, Calum.

01:02:22.965 --> 01:02:24.647
      Tahlia:
       Ooh!

01:02:24.724 --> 01:02:25.465
          -Ooh!
      -(laughing)

01:02:25.467 --> 01:02:26.816
                      You guys.

01:02:26.893 --> 01:02:29.819
 Girl, you better lock
that pretty thing down, honey.

01:02:29.896 --> 01:02:31.246
        He's perfection.

01:02:31.323 --> 01:02:32.247
           And did you see
       the size of his feet?

01:02:32.324 --> 01:02:34.140
         Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:02:34.142 --> 01:02:35.658
That means he has
really big toes.

01:02:35.735 --> 01:02:38.495
  Okay, we got work to do,
people, all right. Let's go.

01:02:38.571 --> 01:02:39.755
        Okay. All right.

01:02:39.831 --> 01:02:41.072
      -Latte?
-Team Eve 2.0. Whoo!

01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:45.260
  ¶ I like where we're going ¶

01:02:47.747 --> 01:02:49.005
      ¶ Don't be shy... ¶

01:02:49.082 --> 01:02:52.342
    -(inaudible dialogue)
  -¶ This is your moment ¶

01:02:53.512 --> 01:02:55.829
      (shouting excitedly)

01:02:55.831 --> 01:02:56.846
  ¶ Take turn crossing lines ¶

01:02:56.923 --> 01:02:58.923
         ¶ I got things
          on my mind ¶

01:02:59.001 --> 01:03:03.336
   ¶ I see you lick your lips
      So hard to resist ¶

01:03:03.338 --> 01:03:05.839
  ¶ I been waiting all night ¶

01:03:05.841 --> 01:03:08.191
      ¶ Are you thinkin'
     what I'm thinkin'? ¶

01:03:08.268 --> 01:03:12.103
     ¶ Are you, are you? ¶

01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:14.864
      ¶ Are you thinkin'
     what I'm thinkin'? ¶

01:03:14.941 --> 01:03:16.566
     ¶ Are you, are you? ¶

01:03:16.643 --> 01:03:18.034
             Yeah!

01:03:18.111 --> 01:03:19.519
         Yeah, you were right.

01:03:19.521 --> 01:03:22.130
 I just had to give her a nudge
    in the right direction.

01:03:22.207 --> 01:03:24.024
              Oh, my gosh.
           You are gonna love

01:03:24.026 --> 01:03:25.616
          what she came up with
         for the new Eve doll.

01:03:25.694 --> 01:03:27.043
                I can't believe
               our plan worked.

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.029
          Mission accomplished.

01:03:29.031 --> 01:03:29.796
         Okay, I gotta go. Bye.

01:03:35.295 --> 01:03:36.553
                Yay! Hot cocoa.

01:03:36.629 --> 01:03:39.630
 What's a celebration
without something hot, right?

01:03:39.708 --> 01:03:41.041
    Stop.

01:03:41.043 --> 01:03:42.466
                    What?

01:03:42.544 --> 01:03:43.301
            Not a fan of cocoa?

01:03:43.378 --> 01:03:45.303
  You know what?

01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:46.655
It just occurred to me,
    I actually...

01:03:46.731 --> 01:03:49.566
don't really know who you are
  or where you came from.

01:03:49.642 --> 01:03:51.901
           Oh! Gracie, it's me.

01:03:51.978 --> 01:03:54.162
               Eve. Your doll.

01:03:54.239 --> 01:03:55.831
         From Sunnyvale. Hello!

01:03:55.907 --> 01:03:58.649
Enough with the Sunnyvale BS!

01:03:58.727 --> 01:04:00.168
It's a fictional place
  we put on the box

01:04:00.245 --> 01:04:01.819
that the Eve doll comes in.

01:04:01.897 --> 01:04:03.154
        I have a serial number.
            You know that.

01:04:03.231 --> 01:04:05.674
  Tha-That was a nice
    little detail.

01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:07.175
I don't know how
you figured that one out.

01:04:07.252 --> 01:04:09.069
I don't really care.

01:04:09.071 --> 01:04:10.494
I don't care who you are
 or where you came from

01:04:10.572 --> 01:04:11.329
or what your grand plan was.

01:04:11.406 --> 01:04:13.573
            What just happened?

01:04:13.575 --> 01:04:14.407
              We were so happy.
             What just changed?

01:04:14.409 --> 01:04:15.350
You tell me, Eve.

01:04:15.427 --> 01:04:17.018
"Mission accomplished"?

01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:21.581
I thought you were my friend.
I thought I could trust you.

01:04:21.583 --> 01:04:23.600
Are you stealing my ideas?

01:04:23.676 --> 01:04:24.526
Working for another
   toy company?

01:04:24.603 --> 01:04:25.935
Who was it?
Come on, just tell me.

01:04:26.012 --> 01:04:29.013
You know what, Gracie?
You're supposed to love animals,

01:04:29.091 --> 01:04:30.590
             not act like them.

01:04:30.592 --> 01:04:31.774
Geez, I've been so stupid.

01:04:31.851 --> 01:04:33.851
Wha-What do you
want me to do?

01:04:33.929 --> 01:04:35.929
The little spell again?

01:04:35.931 --> 01:04:37.488
 <i> Zamba, tarka,</i>
<i> ishtu, nebarim.</i>

01:04:41.436 --> 01:04:42.785
 Yeah, no, that's what
      I thought.

01:04:42.862 --> 01:04:44.045
  You're no more magical
        than I am.

01:04:44.122 --> 01:04:46.715
 Just get out of my face.
  I'm so done with you.

01:04:46.791 --> 01:04:48.199
              Yo-You got me.

01:04:48.276 --> 01:04:48.958
Oh, and one more thing...

01:04:51.446 --> 01:04:52.888
           Eve? Eve!

01:05:01.456 --> 01:05:03.047

                  Did you see?

01:05:04.217 --> 01:05:04.724
      Did I see what?

01:05:06.294 --> 01:05:09.979

01:06:29.469 --> 01:06:31.310
    which I can't even begin
       to understand why.

01:06:32.881 --> 01:06:34.714
 Why, why would you even think
 that I would want that job?

01:06:34.716 --> 01:06:36.382
    Marathon was your baby,
          not mine.

01:06:36.384 --> 01:06:39.810
 I was building a business,
an empire from the ground up,

01:06:39.888 --> 01:06:41.904
                           yes.

01:06:41.981 --> 01:06:42.831
                 That took up
               a lot of time--

01:06:42.907 --> 01:06:43.990
       (speaking Spanish)

01:06:46.152 --> 01:06:48.652
    Oh, just throw a little
    shiny object at Grace,

01:06:48.730 --> 01:06:50.079
   and she'll be
too distracted to notice

01:06:50.156 --> 01:06:51.006
       that her mother's
        never around.

01:06:51.082 --> 01:06:52.340
Well, guess what, Mom?

01:06:52.417 --> 01:06:53.458
           I noticed.

01:06:55.237 --> 01:06:58.254
  All those toys,
that stupid little Eve doll,

01:06:58.331 --> 01:07:00.590
those were all just
  sad reminders

01:07:00.666 --> 01:07:02.575
that you loved your company
 more than you loved me.

01:07:02.577 --> 01:07:03.518
       -Enough, Grace.
     -And a doll, Mom?

01:07:05.930 --> 01:07:07.430
        A <i> muneca </i> was
      my best friend.

01:07:09.342 --> 01:07:10.508
                  Listen to me,
                  Gracie Girl.

01:07:10.585 --> 01:07:13.028
         I worked my ass off

01:07:13.104 --> 01:07:14.529
      to give you a better life
          than I ever had.

01:07:14.606 --> 01:07:16.847
                 I am not going
                  to apologize

01:07:16.925 --> 01:07:17.190
     for what I had to do.

01:07:19.761 --> 01:07:20.869
       You might not like
    all the choices I made.

01:07:22.931 --> 01:07:24.864
       But I made
those choices... for you.

01:07:26.935 --> 01:07:27.492
      And now I've ruined
      everything, right?

01:07:29.287 --> 01:07:31.379
  I've completely undone
all your years of hard work.

01:07:34.776 --> 01:07:36.109
      If there's anyone
 that can pull this company

01:07:36.111 --> 01:07:38.611
    out of the ashes, it's you.

01:07:38.613 --> 01:07:40.204
    You've got what it takes
       to be a great CEO.

01:07:40.282 --> 01:07:43.040
   You're smart, opinionated.

01:07:43.118 --> 01:07:45.301
     You look after others.
        You have vision.

01:07:45.378 --> 01:07:46.344
       It doesn't even
      matter anymore.

01:07:47.956 --> 01:07:48.387
           I'm out.

01:07:50.308 --> 01:07:50.899
      They voted me out.

01:07:52.552 --> 01:07:54.894
        (speaks Spanish)

01:07:59.134 --> 01:08:01.317
                 Keep pushing
               forward, Grace.

01:08:04.639 --> 01:08:07.064
        No one believes in you
           more than I do.

01:08:07.142 --> 01:08:08.899
     As soon as you start
    believing in yourself,

01:08:08.977 --> 01:08:10.034
      big things
  are gonna happen.

01:08:11.646 --> 01:08:12.370
        (speaks Spanish)

01:08:20.154 --> 01:08:21.087
       Ma, do you believe
           in magic?

01:08:22.915 --> 01:08:25.100
Like all that stuff you've been
telling me about the Eve doll?

01:08:28.345 --> 01:08:29.178
     You got the box I left
      for you, didn't you?

01:08:35.837 --> 01:08:36.394
        You've got magic
          in you, too.

01:08:38.264 --> 01:08:38.729
               It's everywhere.

01:08:45.846 --> 01:08:46.737
    Are we allowed to hug?

01:08:53.537 --> 01:08:56.522
  (sobbing) I'm sorry
I haven't been to see you.

01:08:56.524 --> 01:08:57.874
   I'm sorry I'm not there
        to help you.

01:09:02.197 --> 01:09:03.546
        Don't go down
      without a fight.

01:09:05.033 --> 01:09:05.423
        I won't, Mama.

01:09:06.718 --> 01:09:07.300
            I won't.

01:09:16.895 --> 01:09:18.969
     Announcer: <i> Welcome</i>
   <i> to the Marathon Toys</i>

01:09:19.046 --> 01:09:19.562
    <i> shareholder's meeting.</i>

01:09:21.307 --> 01:09:24.325
   Hello, I'm Devin Drake...

01:09:24.402 --> 01:09:26.736
   new CEO of Marathon Toys,

01:09:26.812 --> 01:09:29.404
and welcome to our final
shareholder meeting of the year.

01:09:29.482 --> 01:09:31.557
       I'd like to take this
     opportunity to announce

01:09:31.559 --> 01:09:32.908
         the launch
  of an exciting new line

01:09:32.984 --> 01:09:33.492
            of video game apps
            that I know will--

01:09:35.229 --> 01:09:35.620
I have some things to say.

01:09:43.404 --> 01:09:43.752
     Hi, everyone.

01:09:45.907 --> 01:09:49.517
  I'm Grace Martin.
My mother is Eleanor Martin.

01:09:49.594 --> 01:09:51.167
       Twenty years ago,

01:09:51.246 --> 01:09:52.761
     my mother had nothing.

01:09:52.837 --> 01:09:54.639
  We were barely scraping by.

01:09:56.342 --> 01:09:58.100
     But she had a vision.

01:09:58.177 --> 01:10:00.361
  Her vision was the Eve doll

01:10:00.438 --> 01:10:03.013
        which grew into
   this beautiful company.

01:10:03.091 --> 01:10:04.757
     But, as you all know,

01:10:04.759 --> 01:10:06.275
         times change,

01:10:06.352 --> 01:10:09.186
 other voices weigh in, and...

01:10:09.264 --> 01:10:10.430
     sometimes that vision
       can be blurred.

01:10:10.432 --> 01:10:13.708
    Marathon Toys lost sight
         of the magic,

01:10:13.785 --> 01:10:16.527
        of the idea that
        a doll can spark

01:10:16.604 --> 01:10:16.953
           the imagination
            and inspire,

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:22.217
that a doll can build confidence
      and teach tolerance.

01:10:24.203 --> 01:10:26.721
I know the board voted to
discontinue the Eve doll, but...

01:10:28.374 --> 01:10:30.708
     a wise woman told me,

01:10:30.785 --> 01:10:33.052
      never go down
    without a fight.

01:10:35.047 --> 01:10:37.381
       So without further ado,
          I present to you

01:10:37.459 --> 01:10:38.733
            Eve 2.0.

01:10:45.891 --> 01:10:46.565
     (microphone feedback)

01:10:50.638 --> 01:10:54.307
  <i> ¶ Eve's ready</i>
<i> no matter where she goes ¶</i>

01:10:54.309 --> 01:10:57.067
  <i> ¶ Dress her up</i>
<i> from her head to her toes ¶</i>

01:10:57.145 --> 01:10:58.235
 Eve?

01:10:58.313 --> 01:11:01.038
           (cheering)

01:11:04.652 --> 01:11:06.761
     ¶ Dress me up H to T ¶

01:11:06.838 --> 01:11:07.745
       ¶ Dance all night

01:11:07.822 --> 01:11:10.581

01:11:19.925 --> 01:11:22.760

         ¶ Be a star ¶

01:11:41.873 --> 01:11:44.206
      The new line of Eve dolls
         will inspire kids

01:11:44.283 --> 01:11:46.467
  to be unapologetically proud
        of who they are

01:11:46.544 --> 01:11:50.305
     and keep it 100
       24/7, 365.

01:11:50.381 --> 01:11:51.139
     -Woke Eve!
-(audience applauding)

01:11:51.215 --> 01:11:51.922

    Love is Love Eve.

01:11:56.871 --> 01:11:57.928

01:12:10.810 --> 01:12:11.108
   That one's for you, Casey.

01:12:14.405 --> 01:12:16.831
          -CEO Eve!
        -Grace: Ha!

01:12:16.908 --> 01:12:17.332

01:13:54.505 --> 01:13:56.881
       (audience cheering
        and applauding)

01:14:03.831 --> 01:14:06.441
 Stop clapping, stop clapping.
    None of this matters.

01:14:06.517 --> 01:14:09.669
 None of this matters.
She's not CEO. I-I'm the CEO.
     Devin Drake, CEO.

01:14:09.671 --> 01:14:11.929
    Carter: You know,
you really should think
about getting a lawyer.

01:14:12.006 --> 01:14:13.673
  All the evidence
that you framed Eleanor

01:14:13.675 --> 01:14:15.450
     to climb the ladder
      at Marathon Toys

01:14:15.526 --> 01:14:16.117
   has been handed over
   to the authorities.

01:14:16.194 --> 01:14:17.860
       No.

01:14:17.937 --> 01:14:18.569
   I'm afraid
your time's up.

01:14:20.348 --> 01:14:22.181
         Devin Drake,
     you're under arrest

01:14:22.183 --> 01:14:25.108
 for providing false evidence,
      securities fraud,

01:14:25.186 --> 01:14:26.944
           and insider trading.

01:14:27.021 --> 01:14:28.370
    -You have the right to--
    -I know my damn rights.

01:14:28.447 --> 01:14:29.580
            Great.
     Makes my job easier.

01:14:31.375 --> 01:14:32.467
    Devin:
This isn't over, Carter.

01:14:32.543 --> 01:14:33.301
          Wait.

01:14:35.029 --> 01:14:35.461
 Does this mean my mom...

01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:40.141
     She's innocent.

01:14:40.218 --> 01:14:41.809
          I've already arranged
            for her release.

01:14:41.886 --> 01:14:42.810
        You mother will be home
            for Christmas.

01:14:42.887 --> 01:14:44.145
        (gasps)

01:14:44.222 --> 01:14:45.262
        Thank you!

01:14:47.558 --> 01:14:48.307
            Grace, what you did
            up there today...

01:14:50.135 --> 01:14:50.601
     Boss, I'm so proud of you.

01:14:52.213 --> 01:14:52.987
      Thank you.

01:14:53.064 --> 01:14:54.655
  I'll see you
 in the office.

01:14:54.732 --> 01:14:56.139
Eve:
Gracie.

01:14:56.217 --> 01:15:00.328
     You are amazing. You saved
    the Eve doll and the store.

01:15:00.404 --> 01:15:03.313
  Thank you for being here
   and showing up for me.

01:15:03.391 --> 01:15:04.332
 Even after I treated you
     the way that I--

01:15:04.408 --> 01:15:05.315
                No, you're
             my best friend.

01:15:05.393 --> 01:15:07.502
            I would do anything
                 for you.

01:15:10.581 --> 01:15:11.339
    You're my best friend
         too, Eve.

01:15:14.493 --> 01:15:15.176
  Wait, but where were you?

01:15:15.253 --> 01:15:16.344
           Oh, I was with Hyde.

01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:17.586
             -What?
             -Yeah.

01:15:17.663 --> 01:15:21.073
      Gracie, what does it mean
          when a man says

01:15:21.075 --> 01:15:23.592
       "I never saw you coming,

01:15:23.669 --> 01:15:24.519
          and now I'll never be
               the same."

01:15:24.595 --> 01:15:27.671
          Oh, wow!

01:15:27.749 --> 01:15:28.138
      That man's in love.

01:15:29.917 --> 01:15:33.419
      -What? With me?
   -Yes, with you, Eve.

01:15:33.421 --> 01:15:34.587
You know, you seem
to have that effect on people.

01:15:34.589 --> 01:15:35.271
            (sighs)

01:15:38.109 --> 01:15:39.525
         Gracie Girl, it's time
             for me to go.

01:15:40.853 --> 01:15:42.185
            What?

01:15:42.263 --> 01:15:44.613
            No.

01:15:44.690 --> 01:15:45.364
    No, but I'm not ready
      to say goodbye.

01:15:47.769 --> 01:15:50.269
Come back to the house
and celebrate with us.

01:15:50.271 --> 01:15:51.862
             I wish I could.

01:15:51.939 --> 01:15:54.456
        But Sunnyvale needs me.

01:15:54.533 --> 01:15:56.108
         Woke Eve is blowing up
               my phone,

01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:58.611
and she's saying that she wants
to stage a march at the Capitol.

01:15:58.613 --> 01:16:02.131
And Love is Love Eve says that
there is this little sweet girl

01:16:02.207 --> 01:16:04.967
          in Arkansas
    that is hurting so bad

01:16:05.044 --> 01:16:06.786
           that needs to know
          that it gets better.

01:16:06.788 --> 01:16:08.804
             What you have done
             is truly magical.

01:16:10.883 --> 01:16:11.974
     But it's all
    thanks to you.

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:16.053
     What am I gonna do
        without you?

01:16:16.130 --> 01:16:17.229
       You're never without me.

01:16:20.651 --> 01:16:21.150
                 It's time.

01:16:24.972 --> 01:16:26.822
                Sun of suns...

01:16:26.899 --> 01:16:27.364
             moon of moons...

01:16:29.234 --> 01:16:31.752
                 once awakened,
                 now to return.

01:16:37.819 --> 01:16:38.167
             I'll be gone soon.

01:16:39.578 --> 01:16:42.263
                Hyde: Eve.

01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:44.081
             Oh, my God.
        That was an amazing
           performance.

01:16:44.158 --> 01:16:46.100
                       Amazing.

01:16:46.177 --> 01:16:47.326
          Come on.
   We gotta go celebrate.

01:16:47.328 --> 01:16:48.828
     Hyde, I can't.

01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:50.846
       I can't go.

01:16:50.923 --> 01:16:51.831
     I gotta go home
     to Sunnyvale.

01:16:51.833 --> 01:16:53.666
                   Sunnyvale?

01:16:53.668 --> 01:16:55.000
      That's in Arizona, right?

01:16:55.002 --> 01:16:55.184
      Look, I'm going with you.

01:16:56.854 --> 01:16:57.853
          -Me and you.
             -Yeah?

01:16:57.930 --> 01:16:59.113
             -Yeah.
             -Yeah.

01:16:59.190 --> 01:16:59.947
      Oh, my gosh.

01:17:00.024 --> 01:17:03.342
  Oh, wait.
You need to know

01:17:03.344 --> 01:17:05.786
that I'm a very busy doll.

01:17:05.863 --> 01:17:08.122
     -Doing very important
         doll things.
           -Mm-hmm.

01:17:08.199 --> 01:17:09.782
  Do you think you can handle
         all of this?

01:17:11.352 --> 01:17:13.952
 I've never been more sure
of anything in my entire life.

01:17:15.706 --> 01:17:16.288
            (sighs)

01:17:26.367 --> 01:17:27.290
 I love you, Gracie Girl.

01:17:27.368 --> 01:17:28.701
             (sobs)

01:17:28.703 --> 01:17:29.802
     I love you, Eve.

01:18:25.426 --> 01:18:25.983
         Magic is real.

01:18:30.948 --> 01:18:32.489
              ¶ ¶

01:18:40.124 --> 01:18:42.883
Miss Roberts?
I wasn't sure
you would make it.

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:44.218
        I'm glad I did.

01:18:44.295 --> 01:18:46.462
 I'm gonna be around a lot more
       from here on out.

01:18:46.538 --> 01:18:48.380
   I have a business trip,
   she's coming with me.

01:18:50.284 --> 01:18:52.393
   -I got what I wished for.
            -Mmm.

01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:54.395
    Well, I think there's
  another present for you

01:18:54.472 --> 01:18:56.063
    under the tree,

01:18:56.140 --> 01:18:57.806
   so I hope you're okay
  with opening one more.

01:18:57.883 --> 01:18:58.733
      (squeals and laughs)

01:18:58.809 --> 01:18:59.567
                  Come on, Mom.

01:19:08.803 --> 01:19:10.244
                 I'm so happy
                 you're home.

01:19:10.321 --> 01:19:12.395
        Me too, baby.
          Me too.

01:19:12.473 --> 01:19:15.157
 And I'm so excited to have
   a new business partner

01:19:15.234 --> 01:19:17.826
who's a badass boss lady.

01:19:19.313 --> 01:19:21.163
       Tahlia:
 Y'all are so cute.

01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:23.332
             Oww. PDA. Stop.

01:19:23.408 --> 01:19:25.242
He hates it
when I do that.

01:19:25.319 --> 01:19:26.427
     -Whatever.
-I'll get you a drink.

01:19:26.504 --> 01:19:27.486
      (indistinct chatter)

01:19:27.488 --> 01:19:30.080
   Calum:
Merry Christmas, everyone.

01:19:30.157 --> 01:19:31.414
     I come bearing gifts.

01:19:31.492 --> 01:19:32.767
       Many, many gifts.

01:19:35.679 --> 01:19:37.772
    -Merry Christmas, Grace.
    -Merry Christmas, Calum.

01:19:39.834 --> 01:19:42.835
You know, someone
  once told me

01:19:42.837 --> 01:19:43.685
that there's magic in--

01:19:51.436 --> 01:19:52.602
       Get a room, y'all.

01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:53.737
         (all laughing)

01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:05.123
 Thank you, Grace. This is
the best Christmas gift ever.

01:20:08.362 --> 01:20:08.377
        Miss Roberts:
      What'd you get?

01:20:10.698 --> 01:20:11.788
       Lex:
It's a spell book.

01:20:11.866 --> 01:20:12.965
     Whoa!

01:20:14.869 --> 01:20:15.717
  That is so cool.

01:20:34.479 --> 01:20:34.995
  Hyde, this is plastic.

01:20:35.072 --> 01:20:36.321
    (sighs)

01:20:38.817 --> 01:20:40.334
             At least we have
               each other.

01:20:40.411 --> 01:20:41.335
        Aww!
      (laughs)

01:20:45.066 --> 01:20:46.990
       -Merry Christmas.
       <i> -Feliz navidad.</i>

01:20:47.068 --> 01:20:48.083

        Happy Hanukkah.

01:20:52.406 --> 01:20:53.496
