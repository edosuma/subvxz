01:22.625 --> 01:24.625
- I'll let her know.
- All right.

01:30.132 --> 01:31.818
And still no response
from the governor

01:31.842 --> 01:35.387
after inmates at Litchfield Prison
publicly burned food and other supplies

01:35.470 --> 01:37.222
<i>sent to them from the governor's office.</i>

01:37.305 --> 01:38.574
Man. Two hours of this shit.

01:38.598 --> 01:42.435
It's like watchin' that Yule log channel
at Christmas, only taco flavored.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.229
Looks like the log I made this morning.

01:44.312 --> 01:45.689
Too real.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.108
Bet they never thought
we'd last this long.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.401
I love being underestimated.

01:49.484 --> 01:52.195
Like when no one thought
I'd jump off the river bridge.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.281
Did a fuckin' backflip!

01:54.364 --> 01:56.659
Fuck you, Brent Moxley,
and your stupid cousins, too.

01:57.868 --> 02:01.997
Ah, the black is right.
This is kind of boring and... Yuley.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.373
Hey, what else is on?

02:03.456 --> 02:04.958
<i>Deal or No Deal?</i>

02:05.042 --> 02:07.169
- Um, no deal.
<i>- Duck Dynasty.</i>

02:07.252 --> 02:08.169
- I second that.
- Third.

02:08.252 --> 02:09.755
Fourth.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.924
- For real?
- Yeah.

02:12.007 --> 02:14.217
Y'all are some simple bitches.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.887
Well, time for candy.

02:18.346 --> 02:19.640
Nice, ladies.

02:21.892 --> 02:24.436
It's true. If you have heartburn
when you're pregnant,

02:24.519 --> 02:25.520
you'll have a hairy baby.

02:25.603 --> 02:29.232
My cousin had it real bad.
Her girl is like a little monkey.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.109
That's not how science works, though.

02:31.193 --> 02:34.112
Hey. You ladies
look like you could use a drink.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.827
That piss?
'Cause I don't do that no more.

02:39.910 --> 02:41.662
No, silly.
It's yellow drink.

02:46.959 --> 02:48.719
That ain't bad.
Let me get some more of that.

02:53.757 --> 02:54.967
Damn, yo.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.927
Luschek puts mushrooms on everything.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.345
I think those grew in there.

02:59.387 --> 03:00.430
"Artesian."

03:00.513 --> 03:02.933
She likes her a special mustard.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.310
Oh, man, all this shit is rotten. Fuck.

03:05.393 --> 03:07.062
The milk's still good.

03:07.145 --> 03:11.274
No, I don't fuck with lactose.
Look, check the cabinets.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.489
All's they got is coffee.

03:17.572 --> 03:18.991
I need to eat something soon, yo.

03:19.074 --> 03:20.802
Your face is startin'
to look like a McChicken.

03:20.826 --> 03:21.827
- Really?
- I'm serious.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.203
Hey.

03:24.579 --> 03:25.748
Y'all thirsty?

03:26.331 --> 03:27.665
What the hell is that?

03:27.750 --> 03:31.879
Oh, it's my mama's famous yellow drink.
Part of my community service.

03:31.962 --> 03:34.172
Okay, we don't need yellow drink.
We need calories.

03:34.256 --> 03:35.507
This got calories.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.425
It's made from the lemon candy
at commissary.

03:37.509 --> 03:38.778
Exactly like my mama used to make.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.721
You just take the candies,
crunch 'em, right?

03:40.804 --> 03:43.932
And you twirl it around,
and then you get that taste. Here.

03:47.811 --> 03:50.105
- Good, right?
- This shit is tasty.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.482
It's like my mama used to say,

03:53.358 --> 03:56.779
"When life hands you lemons,
make water with a taste."

04:04.369 --> 04:06.830
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

04:07.705 --> 04:08.874
Thank you so much.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.044
It has that smell.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.339
Can you take three?

04:19.216 --> 04:21.029
That was a good time.
We went around...

04:21.053 --> 04:23.055
I'm doing all right now.
I'm in prison.

04:23.138 --> 04:24.389
Called in. Mmm-hmm.

04:24.472 --> 04:27.225
Oh, you know I tell a good story.
I like to tell a good story.

04:27.309 --> 04:28.369
And I really started it all,

04:28.393 --> 04:30.603
'cause I didn't tell stories
about princesses.

04:30.687 --> 04:31.938
But I said...

04:32.898 --> 04:34.538
Hey.

04:35.192 --> 04:38.361
- Look like you could use a drink in here.
- No, I'm fine.

04:39.112 --> 04:42.157
- Oh! But my guest might be thirsty.
- Oh.

04:42.240 --> 04:47.329
Mmm-hmm. She has ulcerative colitis,
so... makes her dehydrated.

04:47.412 --> 04:50.540
Yeah, growin' up,
I used to have imaginary friends.

04:50.623 --> 04:53.043
- Mmm-hmm.
- Until one of 'em stole the other one's

04:53.126 --> 04:54.752
- imaginary Easy-Bake Oven...
- Mmm-hmm.

04:54.837 --> 04:57.255
And ran him flat over
in her imaginary car.

04:57.339 --> 04:58.506
Classic.

04:59.842 --> 05:01.718
So, uh, what's, uh, your friend's name?

05:02.552 --> 05:06.056
Mommy is not imaginary.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.142
She and Daddy are here for visitation.

05:09.226 --> 05:12.062
Oh. I don't think
they're doin' visitation today.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.022
But it's visitation day.

05:14.106 --> 05:16.483
It is visitation day,
but all the doors have been locked.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.068
There's no guards to watch you cry.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.862
I'm not gonna cry in front of Mommy.

05:21.947 --> 05:23.198
That makes her upset.

05:23.281 --> 05:24.592
- And we can't make Mommy upset.
- Hey.

05:24.616 --> 05:26.010
- Then we have a problem.
- Hey, are you okay?

05:26.034 --> 05:27.953
- We don't...
- No?

05:39.839 --> 05:44.261
I am having some of the bad feelings.

05:46.096 --> 05:51.809
Like... like when you're at the swim party
and all the kids are playing Marco Polo,

05:51.894 --> 05:54.854
but you have the menstruation
in your yellow bathing suit.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.400
Those kinds.

06:00.944 --> 06:02.946
Yeah. Those suck.

06:03.947 --> 06:06.366
- All right.
- They suck.

06:06.449 --> 06:10.453
Uh, well, listen, you stay hydrated,
you hear?

06:10.537 --> 06:11.788
Your mama, too.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.373
Yeah, thank you, Grace.

06:18.003 --> 06:22.590
Oh.
You are the best sister ever.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.470
Thank you, but my name's Tiffany.

06:27.554 --> 06:31.016
Suzanne, hair is not for eating!
It's for keeping your brain warm!

06:32.642 --> 06:34.283
Are you a child?
You're smarter than that.

06:34.311 --> 06:36.580
You should know better than
to eat your hair. Hair is not for that.

06:36.604 --> 06:38.082
That's supposed to be
like a blanket on your brain

06:38.106 --> 06:40.317
to keep you cozy, warm, and protected.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.003
Instead, you're just sitting here,
eating it!

06:42.027 --> 06:43.695
Seriously?

06:43.778 --> 06:47.365
I told you.
You a full-blown Slytherin.

06:47.449 --> 06:51.703
And I'm a lion-hearted Gryffindor
with the intelligence of a Ravenclaw.

06:51.786 --> 06:56.458
But how does it even know this?
I lied for every answer.

06:56.541 --> 07:00.003
They ain't all bad.
Snape was a Slytherin.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.505
It turned out he had that selfless love.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.091
I did have a snake once.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.885
A Burmese python named Krueger.

07:07.970 --> 07:11.348
Technically, it was Cal's,
but Krueger liked me best.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.979
- Did you ever talk to it?
- Mmm-hmm. When I was feeding him.

07:17.062 --> 07:19.522
Epic conversations.
Mostly about the merits

07:19.606 --> 07:23.026
of frozen versus fresh mice
and why Mike Powell never loved me back.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.947
You cold-blooded for sure.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.949
Nobody asked you, Hufflepuff.

07:29.032 --> 07:32.619
White girl hitting you
with some mad expelliarmus!

07:33.786 --> 07:35.622
Yo, T, we got a problem.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.332
Yo, what now?

07:37.415 --> 07:40.793
Suzanne won't leave visitation.
She think her mama is here.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.421
Well, tell her it's cancelled.

07:44.089 --> 07:47.425
Dude, she jabberin' like <i>The Exorcist.</i>
I don't want to get puked on.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.469
Well, I can't play Mama right now.

07:49.552 --> 07:52.930
You see a problem, you deal with it.
I got enough goin' on.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.476
So that's how it is?

07:56.559 --> 07:59.354
Come on. I'll help you.

08:00.813 --> 08:05.110
'Cause Hufflepuffs value friendship,
loyalty and compassion.

08:07.945 --> 08:12.409
Hey, yo. Like, how long it take a bunch
of white people to agree on something?

08:12.492 --> 08:14.744
Our MO is to stop speaking
and harbor resentment,

08:14.827 --> 08:15.870
so this could take years.

08:15.953 --> 08:18.956
Perfect. 'Cause we all hungry in here,

08:19.041 --> 08:22.877
and I just burned a week's worth
of everyone's favorite puffed corn snacks.

08:22.961 --> 08:24.379
You've done everything you could.

08:26.048 --> 08:27.090
Man...

08:29.301 --> 08:33.346
All this, uh... waitin' around...

08:34.806 --> 08:36.683
makes me miss her even more.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.604
You know,
when Cal and I would get bored...

08:45.025 --> 08:49.279
we'd make little figures
out of popsicle sticks

08:49.362 --> 08:52.074
and hide them all over the house
for my parents to find.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.535
Well, I'd make the figures.

08:55.618 --> 08:58.246
Cal sniffed the glue,
which was why we got the snake.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.792
- Y'all a weird family.
- Anyway, my point is...

09:06.379 --> 09:08.215
why don't we do something constructive?

09:09.216 --> 09:11.301
Things are finally going well for once.

09:12.927 --> 09:15.138
Why not enjoy the fruits
of our labor a little bit?

09:16.348 --> 09:17.599
Your labor.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.062
The fruits are your fruits.

09:25.732 --> 09:26.816
I mean, um...

09:28.151 --> 09:30.570
we could do somethin' for Poussey.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.948
She never did get a proper memorial.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.659
That's what I'm talkin' about.

09:40.663 --> 09:43.250
There's that Ravenclaw brain.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.418
- Don't get cute.
- I'm sorry.

09:50.882 --> 09:52.175
You woke up.

09:52.259 --> 09:55.178
See? Told you. She full possessed.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.765
That's what you get
for fuckin' with the spirit world.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.309
This is mental illness, not possession.

10:01.393 --> 10:06.022
Man, she need Jesus or... or Hashem.
She needs somethin'.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.275
What she needs is her old routine back.

10:08.358 --> 10:12.529
- Yeah. Well, we ain't in Kansas no more.
- Mmm.

10:14.864 --> 10:15.864
I got an idea.

10:16.908 --> 10:19.494
- Come on.
- Yeah, all right.

10:19.577 --> 10:23.248
But if she start yelling "cunt,"
I'm callin' me a Catholic.

10:23.831 --> 10:27.544
- So you're looking for painters?
- Not exclusively.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.671
It's really whatever inspires you.
Anything.

10:29.754 --> 10:32.799
It could be sculpture. It could be mosaic.
It could be sand art. It...

10:32.882 --> 10:35.760
But it says "Picasso" and some other word
that starts with a "P."

10:35.843 --> 10:37.429
Picasso wasn't only a painter.

10:37.512 --> 10:40.932
He basically invented constructed
sculpture during his Cubist period.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.143
Not to mention his work with collage.

10:43.226 --> 10:44.894
Why you got to be a bitch?

10:44.977 --> 10:47.272
I used to bang my art teacher.
Don't be jealous.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.984
I'm sorry. I just have to ask.

10:52.068 --> 10:53.986
Why only half the face?

10:54.904 --> 10:57.490
- Well, before.
- Uh-huh.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.576
After. Evening look.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.717
It's for our makeover channel on YouTube.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.705
We're on YouTube now, so...

11:05.332 --> 11:09.836
Why don't you think of this
as, like, a makeover for the prison?

11:11.171 --> 11:14.048
You're beautifying the prison
in Poussey's memory.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.968
- I see.
- Mmm-hmm.

11:17.051 --> 11:18.511
We can totally do that. Mmm-hmm.

11:18.595 --> 11:21.138
Yeah, this place could totally use
lots of makeovers.

11:21.223 --> 11:22.224
I mean,

11:22.307 --> 11:24.976
- with all these Picassos walkin' around...
- Yeah.

11:26.978 --> 11:29.356
- Go for it.
- Hmm.

11:31.608 --> 11:34.736
Mmm. I mean, where do we even start?

11:34.819 --> 11:38.240
- So much ugh, so little time.
- I know.

11:39.782 --> 11:43.495
Yes! Yes!

11:48.375 --> 11:49.501
Look at them.

11:49.584 --> 11:51.961
They're like beached whales, but more sad.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.089
Well, no one's forcing them
to be out here.

11:55.172 --> 11:58.217
Yeah, but we need them out here, you know?

11:58.301 --> 11:59.677
If we ever want this shit to end,

11:59.761 --> 12:02.722
we gotta have more bitches
out here than there is in there.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.015
What's with all this "we"?

12:05.475 --> 12:09.521
Last I checked, you were leading
the Guards Gone Wild cavity search.

12:09.604 --> 12:10.730
I'm a changed woman.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.734
More like bipolar.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.486
Look, I got my reasons.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.405
Point is...

12:18.488 --> 12:20.532
I want this thing over, just like you.

12:20.615 --> 12:22.775
But we're never gonna get it done
sitting on our asses.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.452
We need numbers.

12:24.536 --> 12:25.763
All of your ideas are welcome.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.580
This is an opportunity
to express yourself.

12:27.664 --> 12:30.625
We want your creativity, your vision.
No idea is a bad idea.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.294
You running for student body president?

12:33.127 --> 12:34.921
More like a student council position.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.382
Well, you seem extra perky today.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.717
What's not to like?
There are no guards.

12:40.635 --> 12:43.721
Freedom from the male gaze.
Sunshine.

12:43.805 --> 12:45.765
Well, I'm glad
you're enjoying yourself now,

12:45.848 --> 12:48.184
'cause it'll be less fun
when people start getting killed.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.102
You mean more people?

12:50.812 --> 12:54.190
This is not
some shiny extracurricular, Piper.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.442
You're right.
This is actually very important.

12:58.903 --> 13:01.739
Whatever.
It's far too hot to fight with you.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.450
Hot... Come here.

13:03.533 --> 13:04.742
Time out.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.956
- When was the last time you took a shower?
- Seriously?

13:10.039 --> 13:13.501
Yeah. Being antiestablishment
does not mean you have to be dirty.

13:13.585 --> 13:16.003
Activism really brings out
your inner bitch.

13:16.087 --> 13:18.631
What? I work hard all day.

13:18.715 --> 13:21.634
I want to come home to somebody
who...

13:21.718 --> 13:24.178
takes care of themselves.
What? Is that so much to ask?

13:24.261 --> 13:27.014
Okay, so I'm your new project now?

13:27.098 --> 13:28.683
Go back to your little craft fair.

13:28.766 --> 13:31.561
It's not a craft fair.
It's a memorial installation.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.187
You can install it up your ass.

13:33.771 --> 13:36.024
Could you wash your ass?

13:36.107 --> 13:39.736
Fucking <i>guera</i> trying to steal
our people with this arty bullshit.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.530
I think it could be nice.

13:42.614 --> 13:46.451
- Oh, so you're on their side now, too?
- It's not about sides. I'm just saying.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.375
This place can be so ugly
that it's depressing.

13:50.287 --> 13:53.124
Well, if you want to make art so bad,
why don't you do it out here?

13:53.207 --> 13:55.460
- Don't be a dick.
- No, seriously.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.420
We got to make
this place nice and fix it up.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.881
Like you said, it's depressing.
So come on.

14:01.298 --> 14:02.509
Get your crayons.

14:03.426 --> 14:06.262
I've always been
more of a girth gal, myself.

14:06.345 --> 14:09.974
Don't like them long jobbies
that poke your cervix.

14:10.057 --> 14:12.644
Amen to that.

14:12.727 --> 14:14.937
Ain't nothin' like a Fat Albert.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.482
Those fatties stretch you out.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.651
I like to stay tight.

14:19.734 --> 14:22.028
Ain't yoga good for that?

14:22.111 --> 14:28.410
No, but it does make the dirty
wheelbarrow position a lot easier.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.202
How 'bout you, Norma?

14:30.286 --> 14:33.540
What's the dirtiest thing
you've ever done?

14:46.302 --> 14:47.762
Let me see. Let me see.

14:47.845 --> 14:52.016
Damn! I didn't know
you ladies got down like that.

14:52.642 --> 14:56.062
They didn't call it
the sexual revolution for nothin'.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.731
Come on, squirt. What you got?

14:58.815 --> 15:00.942
There was this one guy I dated.

15:01.859 --> 15:02.860
He had a foot thing.

15:02.944 --> 15:06.280
Like high heels and all of that?

15:06.363 --> 15:08.491
No. Foot jobs.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.577
Like hand jobs, but with your feet.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.286
- Whoa.
- How does that even work?

15:12.369 --> 15:15.206
Imagine picking up a hot dog...

15:15.289 --> 15:17.124
- Whoa.
- With your toes,

15:17.208 --> 15:19.502
and then massaging it with your arches.

15:20.712 --> 15:24.131
It gave me calves like a speed skater.

15:24.215 --> 15:25.550
Mmm!

15:35.059 --> 15:38.312
<i>Lorna? I can't believe I'm lookin' at you.</i>

15:40.648 --> 15:41.941
<i>What's the matter?
You hurt?</i>

15:42.024 --> 15:44.986
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.655
<i>Breathe. Right.
Just take a deep breath.</i>

15:47.739 --> 15:49.532
- I'm breathing.
<i>- Good.</i>

15:49.616 --> 15:50.718
<i>Now tell me what's goin' on.</i>

15:50.742 --> 15:52.678
<i>I've been watchin' the news.
They're not sayin' nothin'.</i>

15:52.702 --> 15:55.788
<i>They're just showin' this pile
of burnt chip bags.</i>

15:55.872 --> 15:57.790
<i>Is it true somebody's got a gun in there?</i>

15:57.874 --> 15:59.250
I don't know. I don't know.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.461
Somebody did get shot,
and there was a lot of blood.

16:01.544 --> 16:03.588
And I got nobody in here, baby.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.381
- I got nobody.
<i>- Listen to me.</i>

16:05.465 --> 16:06.883
<i>Go and find someplace to hide.</i>

16:06.966 --> 16:09.844
<i>Someplace safe, away from the guns,
all right? I'm on my way.</i>

16:09.927 --> 16:11.513
You... you're comin' here for me?

16:11.596 --> 16:12.847
<i>Of course I am.</i>

16:12.930 --> 16:14.370
Listen, I got to tell you somethin'.

16:16.809 --> 16:20.563
Vinnie. Vin... Vinnie?
Vinnie, I got somethin' to tell you.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.065
Hon... Hon... Vinnie! Vinnie?

16:26.819 --> 16:28.195
He's coming for me.

16:28.279 --> 16:31.157
Call him back.
You forgot about the Burger King.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.384
That smells good.
Smell that.

16:32.408 --> 16:33.761
That's what I'm talkin'
about right there.

16:33.785 --> 16:34.865
Mmm. I miss coffee.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.412
Thanks for the coffee.

16:41.042 --> 16:42.293
I gotta say...

16:42.376 --> 16:44.378
for a bunch of plantain-loving subhumans,

16:44.461 --> 16:46.589
you Latinos make
a damn good cup of coffee.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.800
Well, if it wasn't for you
soulless white crackers

16:48.883 --> 16:51.177
comin' over and taking land
from us Hispanics...

16:51.928 --> 16:53.489
we never would've had coffee
in the first place.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.431
Actually, that was the Hispanics.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.308
What are you talkin' about?

16:57.391 --> 16:59.936
"Hispanic" refers to people
from Spanish-speaking countries,

17:00.019 --> 17:01.228
which includes the Spanish,

17:01.312 --> 17:03.606
who colonized Latin America,
creating Latinos.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.942
Oh, for serious?
Oh, that's mad interesting.

17:06.901 --> 17:08.611
Have you thought about
expanding your menu?

17:08.694 --> 17:13.825
You know, like, lattes and stuff.
Flat whites, cortados, breves?

17:13.907 --> 17:16.160
Listen to
Chock Full O' Fancy Nuts over here.

17:16.242 --> 17:18.829
I was on the cover
of <i>Barista Magazine</i> twice

17:18.913 --> 17:22.415
before the FBI figured out
I was poisoning Jews and mud people.

17:24.001 --> 17:26.588
Oh, snap. Yo, I know you.

17:27.378 --> 17:28.505
You a subscriber?

17:28.590 --> 17:30.299
Nah, um... from the news.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.760
Yo, that... that black guy,
he got real sick.

17:32.844 --> 17:35.555
Yeah, they all got real sick.
That was the point.

17:35.638 --> 17:37.557
But they enjoyed the drinks going down.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.767
Look, you wanna lend us a hand?

17:39.851 --> 17:41.477
I mean, we could use some help here.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.021
But you gotta promise no poison.

17:44.689 --> 17:47.149
Like I carry around antifreeze.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.276
Promise.

17:50.987 --> 17:54.699
Got a iced coffee
for Princess Buttercream?

18:05.042 --> 18:08.045
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:08.129 --> 18:10.172
Is it me, or is this prison
beginning to feel like,

18:10.256 --> 18:12.592
I don't know, Club Med Punta Cana?

18:12.675 --> 18:15.845
It does seem oddly peaceful today.
Must be the heat.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.890
Or the absence of a patriarchy.

18:19.807 --> 18:22.476
Is that woman really offering
to braid people's pubes?

18:22.559 --> 18:24.687
Full bush for a half a Snickers.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.355
- Not bad.
- Yeah, not bad.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.818
Oh, that's gorgeous.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.403
- That necklace?
- Yeah.

18:32.486 --> 18:33.487
Okay.

18:33.570 --> 18:34.864
Hey, chum.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.634
Five orange Starburst for the necklace.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.302
Make 'em pink ones, we can start to talk.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.662
What fuckin' planet are you on?

18:40.745 --> 18:44.707
I just got a Playtex Gentle Glide
360 Ultra for one yellow. One.

18:45.708 --> 18:47.508
All right, six orange, or I walk.
Final offer.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.378
- No sale.
- Okay.

18:52.840 --> 18:56.886
Six orange, and I won't tear it apart,
rendering it garbage.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.137
That's pretty aggressive.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.806
Come on. This was a lot of work.

18:59.889 --> 19:03.184
Look, I wouldn't be threatening to
destroy it if I didn't think it was great.

19:03.267 --> 19:05.645
- Six orange, going once...
- No! Fine! Fine.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.899
Pleasure doin' business with you.

19:10.399 --> 19:13.527
- You really shouldn't have.
- Oh, of course I should have.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.448
- Oh.
- Well...

19:17.531 --> 19:18.772
- Thank you.
- Fuck you.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.286
But what about visitation?

19:22.369 --> 19:25.081
Now, we done told you, Suzanne.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.000
You in Bitchfield now, right?

19:28.084 --> 19:31.295
Different name,
different visitation schedule.

19:31.378 --> 19:33.965
But almost everything else is the same.

19:34.048 --> 19:36.843
- Mmm. I see.
- Mmm.

19:36.926 --> 19:40.847
So it's like prison within a prison.

19:40.930 --> 19:44.058
Double prison.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.352
Exactly.

19:46.435 --> 19:49.981
And I'm the trap queen.

19:50.064 --> 19:53.818
Now...
First order of bidniss.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.780
I'mma have to confiscate
all your candy.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.741
And maybe the Dr. Miracle's.

19:59.824 --> 20:02.368
Mmm-mmm.
Aren't you gonna do a count first?

20:03.327 --> 20:04.370
There's only two of y'all.

20:04.453 --> 20:08.833
Well, I don't know
how things go in your prison,

20:08.916 --> 20:10.459
but in my old prison,

20:10.542 --> 20:14.171
they did a count
and then a search for contraband.

20:14.255 --> 20:18.425
- Fine. One.
- Two.

20:18.509 --> 20:19.886
You're counted.

20:21.095 --> 20:22.263
Now hand it over.

20:27.935 --> 20:30.980
Oh, my favorites.

20:33.565 --> 20:35.359
Uh... come on.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.493
Whatever.

20:44.576 --> 20:47.038
Wait. You can't leave.

20:47.121 --> 20:49.791
- Why not?
- Mr. Cluckles.

20:51.167 --> 20:52.752
He's contraband. That's a shot.

20:52.835 --> 20:55.212
And have you even looked at my bunk?

20:55.296 --> 20:59.759
Easily two shots.
Although, I would argue three.

21:00.342 --> 21:03.429
Mmm-mmm. I can't do this.
Your ass is too damn crazy.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.807
Please, don't call me that.

21:06.473 --> 21:11.938
Maybe Bitchfield needs more inmates
to make it feel more like Litchfield.

21:12.021 --> 21:14.648
Quantity over quality.

21:14.731 --> 21:16.692
And where are we
supposed to get inmates from?

21:16.776 --> 21:18.986
We done freed the whole damn prison.

21:21.530 --> 21:25.117
Hey, where are the guards at?
Figured they could use a drink.

21:25.201 --> 21:28.287
Yeah, they... they locked up
in Spanish Harlem.

21:30.206 --> 21:31.290
Hmm.

21:31.373 --> 21:32.624
One, two.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.710
- One, two.
- Come on, jab, jab.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.170
- One, one.
- One, one.

21:36.253 --> 21:37.546
- One, two.
- One, two.

21:37.629 --> 21:38.755
Jab, cross.

21:38.840 --> 21:41.968
Come on, jab, cross.
One, one. Come on, one, two.

21:42.051 --> 21:44.971
Let's go! Come on, pump!
Come on. Work with me.

21:45.054 --> 21:46.222
Oh, thank God! Water.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.140
No, you get water
when I say you get water.

21:48.224 --> 21:49.409
We ain't done yet.

21:49.433 --> 21:50.726
But I'm dehydrated.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.937
Tough shit.
Shouldn't drink all that hooch.

21:53.020 --> 21:57.483
Now I want you to punch this face
like it's the person you're most angry at.

21:57.566 --> 21:59.276
Okay, that is so reductionistic.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.653
I'm not, like, angry
at one individual person.

22:01.737 --> 22:05.157
- You gotta want to punch something.
- Yeah, but it's bigger than people.

22:05.241 --> 22:07.910
I want to punch
the prison-industrial complex.

22:07.994 --> 22:11.038
Well, I can't draw that shit,
so punch the pillow!

22:11.122 --> 22:12.456
Okay.

22:13.790 --> 22:18.295
And the clams at the bottom of the mural
represent Poussey's past lovers.

22:19.213 --> 22:24.343
So she dives in search of them.
Always reaching. Always searching.

22:24.426 --> 22:26.637
Yearning to unlock

22:26.720 --> 22:28.890
- the mysteries of their pearls.
- Ah.

22:30.141 --> 22:31.433
Thank you.

22:31.517 --> 22:32.518
Hold up.

22:32.601 --> 22:36.105
What exactly do clams
got to do with Poussey?

22:36.188 --> 22:37.523
She from Philly.

22:38.440 --> 22:41.944
Well, they're sort of vaginal, you know?
Because of their shape.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.571
Well, technically,
oysters make pearls, not clams.

22:44.655 --> 22:48.450
But they're representational here, right?

22:48.534 --> 22:49.911
Do they symbolize pleasure?

22:50.494 --> 22:53.122
Exactly. Yes.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.415
They're orgasms.

22:55.374 --> 22:58.460
- We'll get back to you.
- That means no, doesn't it?

22:58.544 --> 23:00.922
Look, I'm not gonna disrespect Poussey

23:01.005 --> 23:04.091
with some 2,000 Leagues
Under the Vajayjay shit.

23:04.967 --> 23:06.802
Thank you for your effort.
Next.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.431
I... I was already up here,

23:11.348 --> 23:15.519
but I really think hair dolls can work,
you guys.

23:15.602 --> 23:18.564
Jab. Jab. Come on, one, one.

23:18.647 --> 23:20.024
Hey!

23:20.857 --> 23:23.694
Can you wax on,
wax off someplace else?

23:23.777 --> 23:25.612
She getting her rage out, T!

23:25.696 --> 23:27.281
Well, she's buildin' mine, yo!

23:27.364 --> 23:28.633
We tryin' to get some shit done here,

23:28.657 --> 23:30.701
and we can't
with all that huffin' and puffin'!

23:30.784 --> 23:32.369
You're wasting your time!

23:32.453 --> 23:33.745
The hell you know?

23:33.829 --> 23:36.457
I know that Poussey wouldn't have wanted

23:36.540 --> 23:41.545
a wall of nautical sex motifs
or death-themed macaroni art.

23:42.171 --> 23:43.839
She would've wanted something special.

23:43.922 --> 23:45.424
Like hair dolls.

23:45.507 --> 23:51.097
Like everybody coming together to create
something beautiful and memorable.

23:52.264 --> 23:56.018
And what would that look like,
O visionary warrior?

23:56.102 --> 23:58.604
You want to grunt an actual idea, maybe?

24:01.690 --> 24:05.777
So as you can see, it's, like, way less
crowded out here than it is in the dorms.

24:05.861 --> 24:09.365
And also,
we have a thriving artistic community,

24:09.448 --> 24:12.243
which I know is so important to you gays.

24:12.326 --> 24:14.161
What do you think, Von Barlow?

24:14.245 --> 24:16.330
- I mean, I do like the sunlight.
- Uh-huh.

24:16.413 --> 24:19.041
Ah. Well, wait until you
see the nightlife.

24:20.042 --> 24:21.752
And over here is our market district...

24:21.835 --> 24:23.087
When in Lesbos, huh?

24:23.170 --> 24:25.256
You told me to blend.
I'm blending.

24:25.339 --> 24:28.509
Fucking the prison's lead stud
isn't what I meant.

24:28.592 --> 24:31.553
Well, we're not fucking.
We've agreed to take things slow.

24:31.637 --> 24:34.723
Oh.
And what about your other beau?

24:34.806 --> 24:37.934
The one who's in the guard bubble,
probably being sodomized right about now?

24:38.019 --> 24:41.022
Listen, I told your blonde friend
that Joe and I are over.

24:41.105 --> 24:43.440
Wait. You don't think
they're really doing sodomy, do you?

24:43.524 --> 24:45.859
What do you care?
You've got your new crush to worry about.

24:45.942 --> 24:48.612
Listen, I'm just trying to keep
my head above water, okay?

24:48.695 --> 24:50.132
When's this all gonna be over, anyway?

24:50.156 --> 24:52.116
Once she realizes
you're not gonna put out.

24:52.199 --> 24:54.118
...aromatherapy, and Shih Tzu.

24:54.743 --> 24:55.994
Is this one botherin' you?

24:56.078 --> 24:59.123
No. No, no. She's, uh, trying
to trade something for deodorant.

24:59.206 --> 25:01.125
Gum? Look what I have.

25:02.043 --> 25:04.378
Come on. There you go.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.061
Take a cold shower, Vause.
She's with me.

25:06.088 --> 25:08.006
- Shall we, Amelia?
- Yes.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.261
Hey, you okay?

25:14.513 --> 25:16.182
Who the hell are you?

25:16.265 --> 25:19.310
What? It's me.
They brushed my hair.

25:19.393 --> 25:22.271
Your eyebrows. They're plural.

25:22.354 --> 25:25.441
I had three once.
Back in my punk-rock days.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.609
I'm trying to picture that.

25:27.693 --> 25:30.487
- What's that?
- It's Humphrey's.

25:30.571 --> 25:33.449
I thought we'd use it
to lure Piscatella inside,

25:33.532 --> 25:36.202
but I can't figure out the passcode.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.412
You tried 1815?
Battle of Waterloo?

25:38.495 --> 25:40.081
Of course. I'm not an idiot.

25:40.164 --> 25:42.499
- What about "tits" spelled with numbers?
- That, too.

25:42.583 --> 25:46.462
- Oh! Jeffrey Dahmer's birthday.
- I've tried everything! It's useless!

25:46.545 --> 25:50.216
All that hard work was for <i>nichevo!</i>

25:50.299 --> 25:51.883
I'm a failure!

25:51.967 --> 25:55.804
I failed my girls! I failed you!

25:55.887 --> 25:59.350
<i>Ay coño.</i>
Pull yourself together. Here.

26:01.143 --> 26:02.228
What is it?

26:02.311 --> 26:04.355
Just a vitamin.
Works faster this way.

26:05.772 --> 26:06.773
Sniff.

26:10.652 --> 26:11.653
Better?

26:11.737 --> 26:16.950
Oh, my God.
The answer was right under our noses.

26:17.659 --> 26:18.827
So to speak.

26:18.910 --> 26:21.037
Come. I know what we must do.

26:25.041 --> 26:27.169
You look radiant, by the way.

26:31.006 --> 26:32.258
Where you think you're going?

26:32.841 --> 26:35.844
Outside. My husband is coming for me.

26:35.927 --> 26:39.515
You go out there, the pigs are gonna
throw you in Max faster than you can say,

26:39.598 --> 26:41.767
"Please don't throw me in Max."

26:41.850 --> 26:45.771
Well, I have to talk to him.
I have some very important news to share.

26:45.854 --> 26:46.855
Don't he text?

26:46.938 --> 26:48.859
I'm not gonna text my husband
I'm pregnant, okay?

26:49.900 --> 26:52.653
Oops!
You happy now?

26:52.736 --> 26:54.738
Yeah, that's not a good text.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.200
Or is it? I don't know you.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.910
Oh, you should tell him, like,

26:59.993 --> 27:02.246
with one of those
promposal videos online.

27:02.329 --> 27:05.040
My cousin did one
where he jumped out a helicopter.

27:05.123 --> 27:06.625
And it was written on the parachute?

27:06.708 --> 27:09.920
Yeah. But he landed bad
and shattered his pelvis.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.297
Couldn't dance after that.

27:11.380 --> 27:13.215
You know, that's not a bad idea.

27:13.299 --> 27:16.218
I should do something like that.
This is big news, right?

27:16.302 --> 27:17.469
Yeah.

27:17.553 --> 27:20.306
But don't do the parachute thing.
That's copying.

27:20.389 --> 27:23.684
No. No, I wouldn't do that.
Mine is gonna be so much better.

27:26.353 --> 27:27.646
How she even get pregnant?

27:27.729 --> 27:30.482
She didn't.
Ain't you heard of Lorna <i>la Loca?</i>

27:31.066 --> 27:32.943
Oh, that's Lorna <i>la Loca?</i>

27:33.985 --> 27:35.196
She's cuter than I thought.

27:40.158 --> 27:41.285
Nichols?

27:43.204 --> 27:46.707
Ah. Man,
didn't anyone ever teach you to knock?

27:47.291 --> 27:50.043
What, are you tryin' to drown yourself
like a turkey in the rain?

27:52.338 --> 27:54.506
Guess I just needed a soak.

27:57.384 --> 27:58.594
Girl drama?

27:58.677 --> 28:03.974
I'm just having some serious feelings
about, uh... inmate civil liberties.

28:05.976 --> 28:07.561
Yeah, you're not alone.

28:07.644 --> 28:08.854
Girls are the fucking worst.

28:08.937 --> 28:12.316
- Everything okay over there, boss?
- Peachy, thanks.

28:12.399 --> 28:14.860
Starting a lesbian biker cult?

28:14.943 --> 28:17.654
I guess my invite got lost
in the mail, huh?

28:17.738 --> 28:18.822
It's not funny.

28:18.905 --> 28:21.199
How does one destroy an army of clones?

28:21.992 --> 28:23.201
I missed that movie.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.497
Hey, maybe go blonde.
Throw 'em off your scent.

28:26.580 --> 28:30.208
Yeah, I'll be completely anonymous
around here as a six-foot-tall blonde.

28:31.042 --> 28:32.883
Yeah, well,
change is very important, actually.

28:34.004 --> 28:37.883
When my mom would, uh,
catch my dad cheating, she would just...

28:39.301 --> 28:42.721
get a new hairdo, wax the bush,

28:42.804 --> 28:45.015
try some new eye shadow. Whatever.

28:45.098 --> 28:47.684
- Yeah. And that worked for her?
- Well, no.

28:48.852 --> 28:51.104
But fucking his brother did.

28:51.813 --> 28:54.900
Uncle Ray really appreciated
that kinda thing.

28:57.528 --> 28:59.780
See?

28:59.863 --> 29:02.699
Now your eyes
don't look upside down no more.

29:02.783 --> 29:04.243
This is great.

29:04.326 --> 29:06.119
I miss Heroin Barbie.

29:06.202 --> 29:07.413
You're welcome.

29:08.997 --> 29:11.292
I literally want to go fuck myself.

29:12.626 --> 29:14.210
Like, right now.

29:14.295 --> 29:17.464
All right, Vause.
Your idea, your turn.

29:18.507 --> 29:20.592
I'm having second thoughts.

29:20.676 --> 29:21.677
Ha!

29:22.886 --> 29:24.930
Don't be a chickenshit.

29:25.013 --> 29:26.014
Please?

29:26.097 --> 29:27.433
Let us fix your bustedness.

29:28.016 --> 29:31.270
- It's for the community.
- Fine.

29:31.353 --> 29:33.397
- Yay!
- A blank canvas.

29:37.318 --> 29:40.321
I'm thinkin' we go short.
Right off the bat. Mmm-hmm.

29:40.404 --> 29:42.131
Yes, that'll be cute.
What do you think?

29:42.155 --> 29:43.865
I don't know.
That seems a little dramatic.

29:43.949 --> 29:46.868
True. And you do have weird ears.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.537
- No.
- The right one's a little...

29:49.496 --> 29:51.039
No. No. No.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.542
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No. No. Just...

29:55.586 --> 29:58.630
You need to line the top hem
with the edge of the bed,

29:58.714 --> 30:01.425
then fold and tuck for maximum crispness!

30:03.176 --> 30:05.196
- You should really listen to her.
- Thank you.

30:05.220 --> 30:07.699
I was in the army for six years.
I know how to make a goddamn bed.

30:07.723 --> 30:09.766
No wonder they use drones.

30:10.559 --> 30:11.602
This is fucked up.

30:12.394 --> 30:14.747
At least they took us out of that room
with the shit bucket.

30:14.771 --> 30:16.416
This whole fuckin' place is a shit bucket.

30:16.440 --> 30:20.193
Why are we even doin' this?
'Cause some mental case wants playmates?

30:20.276 --> 30:21.945
Same reason I was born.

30:24.573 --> 30:26.116
Here... here she comes.

30:39.045 --> 30:40.381
Boo!

30:43.884 --> 30:45.844
Hmm.

30:49.431 --> 30:50.516
Hmm.

31:09.660 --> 31:11.620
Huh? Huh? Huh?

31:11.703 --> 31:14.456
Look at this, huh?

31:16.249 --> 31:18.251
I worked really hard on that.

31:18.335 --> 31:19.419
Uh...

31:20.629 --> 31:21.963
I'm sorry.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.801
Did you want to go to the Poo?

31:26.968 --> 31:29.638
- 'Cause I can make that happen.
- Oh, God.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.347
Not now. Not now.

31:31.432 --> 31:33.684
Anybody else got somethin'
they want to say?

31:36.687 --> 31:37.688
Huh?

31:38.897 --> 31:40.732
Hmm?

31:43.985 --> 31:46.572
- You want some, too?
- No. No, I don't.

31:49.450 --> 31:52.035
Yo, this is so...

31:52.118 --> 31:53.704
Enjoying yourself?

31:55.664 --> 31:58.875
It's no Judy King slave, but it works.

31:59.876 --> 32:02.003
How long before we gotta return them?

32:03.004 --> 32:06.382
I paid four bags
of mini Reese's Cups for they asses.

32:06.467 --> 32:08.635
We got time. Shit.

32:09.595 --> 32:12.055
And if they get out of line...

32:12.138 --> 32:14.891
we'll crack that whip on 'em.
You feel me?

32:14.975 --> 32:17.060
Yeah.

32:17.143 --> 32:18.770
- Yes, ma'am.
- Clink.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.025
Now what do we do?

32:25.151 --> 32:29.072
Now we settle into a witty banter

32:29.155 --> 32:33.994
that is insightful but also
comically aloof.

32:35.871 --> 32:37.706
Now you start.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.458
Oh. All right.

32:40.041 --> 32:41.251
Women, am I right?

32:44.045 --> 32:45.046
Or not.

32:47.298 --> 32:50.343
Every generation
bucks the established order.

32:50.426 --> 32:51.762
God knows we did it.

32:51.845 --> 32:54.055
I remember '68,

32:54.139 --> 32:59.811
MLK, RFK,
the first interracial <i>Star Trek</i> kiss.

32:59.895 --> 33:01.122
People thought it was Armageddon.

33:01.146 --> 33:06.234
Yet here we are, 50 years later,
and still fighting over the same shit.

33:06.943 --> 33:08.862
If they want to throw a hissy fit,

33:08.945 --> 33:12.783
it's on them to clean up
the Cheerios when it's over.

33:13.950 --> 33:16.471
Just 'cause we're their elders
don't mean we got to wipe their ass

33:16.495 --> 33:20.331
- every time they take a shit, right?
- Exactly.

33:20.415 --> 33:25.045
When the Helots tried to throw off
the yoke of the Spartans at Laconia,

33:25.128 --> 33:28.799
the Gerousia didn't run out
onto the battlefield, did they?

33:28.882 --> 33:30.008
Gerousia?

33:30.091 --> 33:32.844
I think she dated my brother, Sal.

33:32.928 --> 33:34.596
Gerousia Vitti.

33:34.680 --> 33:38.600
From the office-supply Vittis,
not from the pepperoni Vittis.

33:38.684 --> 33:41.728
It means "elder council."

33:41.812 --> 33:45.524
- Point is, we put in our time.
- Yeah, cheers to that.

33:45.607 --> 33:46.650
- Yeah.
- Yeah, cheers.

33:46.733 --> 33:49.069
It's your turn, Footjobs.

33:49.152 --> 33:50.421
Shit!

33:50.445 --> 33:53.323
Jesus, Gina!
The hell you doin' over there?

33:53.406 --> 33:56.159
It's a signal booster.
The service sucks down here.

33:56.242 --> 33:58.620
Kids, always with the screens.

34:00.455 --> 34:02.457
- Oh!
- Oh! That's game.

34:34.614 --> 34:36.824
Full bush.

Revolting women.
My sisters.

34:40.536 --> 34:43.206
Stand united.
Better guards.

34:43.289 --> 34:44.916
Yummy snacks.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.585
Nicer yard.

34:46.668 --> 34:50.255
Maxi Pads.
Cleaner showers.

34:50.338 --> 34:51.422
Voices screaming.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.424
Fight the power!

34:58.429 --> 34:59.723
That's my girl.

35:00.348 --> 35:01.349
Get up there.

35:01.432 --> 35:03.685
Um, I can't.
It's... it's too many people.

35:03.769 --> 35:06.021
You got this. Go.

35:06.104 --> 35:07.147
Go.

35:16.156 --> 35:19.325
Hey, Litchfield, how y'all doin'?
Uh, it's good to be back here.

35:20.493 --> 35:22.096
Uh, I'm gonna do some impressions
for y'all today.

35:25.749 --> 35:27.125
Holy ravioli.

35:27.208 --> 35:30.378
My husband put his mozzarella

35:30.461 --> 35:35.300
all over my baked ziti,
and he told me that he loved me.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.343
Isn't that romantic?

35:37.427 --> 35:38.970
Lorna <i>la Loca!</i>

35:39.595 --> 35:42.808
Hey, blondie.
Does the, uh, carpet match the drapes?

35:45.686 --> 35:48.021
Hey, uh, let me test
the echo in your love cave.

35:48.104 --> 35:50.523
I promise,
you'll only like it a lot.

35:50.606 --> 35:52.150
Nichols!

35:53.318 --> 35:56.237
Oh, what's the matter?
I'm not white enough for you?

35:56.321 --> 35:59.658
Yeah, okay! We get it.

35:59.741 --> 36:02.535
In Russia,
we do not have Happy Meal.

36:02.618 --> 36:05.080
We have Unhappy Meal.

36:06.622 --> 36:08.583
Insult my food...

36:09.500 --> 36:10.711
I kill your family.

36:18.551 --> 36:22.222
So, you see, it's not one structure.

36:22.305 --> 36:27.936
It's a living, breathing example of what
Poussey would've wanted this prison to be.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.481
And who's supposed to build all this?

36:32.816 --> 36:35.110
All of us, as a community.

36:36.027 --> 36:41.407
We'll each do what we can and,
together, create a portrait of Poussey.

36:42.325 --> 36:45.203
It'll be, like, a monument to her legacy.

36:47.914 --> 36:51.584
Right. And then we all do <i>Thriller.</i>

36:51.667 --> 36:53.754
Mmm.

36:54.670 --> 36:57.132
Okay. I know that it seems crazy,

36:57.215 --> 37:00.593
but when Maya Lin conceived
of the Vietnam Memorial,

37:00.676 --> 37:02.037
people thought she was crazy, too.

37:02.095 --> 37:05.891
And now it's one of the most visited
attractions in Washington, DC.

37:05.974 --> 37:09.435
You know, Larry and I did visit there
once, and it was very moving.

37:09.519 --> 37:11.687
Well, this ain't Washington, DC.

37:12.605 --> 37:15.275
- And I don't know who the fuck Larry is...
- Mmm-hmm.

37:15.358 --> 37:19.362
But I'm guessin' the demographic
in here ain't very Larry-like.

37:19.445 --> 37:23.074
Fine. Go with the fuckin'
hair dolls, then. I tried.

37:23.158 --> 37:24.159
Yes.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.702
Just wait. Wait.

37:28.413 --> 37:30.123
Let's at least give her a shot.

37:31.124 --> 37:33.584
I mean, it's this or we have clams.

37:39.800 --> 37:40.801
Fine.

37:41.634 --> 37:44.262
But don't fuck this up, Maya.

37:52.312 --> 37:53.897
There ain't no justice.

37:53.980 --> 37:57.025
Pushin' a cart like a retard
ain't gonna get my finger back.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.795
Yeah, but if we make
enough money selling coffee,

37:58.819 --> 38:00.821
maybe we could hire better representation.

38:00.904 --> 38:03.073
Someone like...
Oh! Johnnie Cock-hand!

38:03.156 --> 38:04.783
Who is Johnnie Cock-hand?

38:04.866 --> 38:07.327
From <i>The BJ Story,</i> my favorite porno.

38:07.410 --> 38:10.288
He totally got that black guy off.
And off.

38:10.371 --> 38:14.125
The world don't work like pornos, Angie.
I wish it did.

38:14.209 --> 38:17.963
The system's busted.
We gotta take matters into our own hands.

38:18.046 --> 38:19.481
Okay, but can you use your good hand?

38:19.505 --> 38:22.425
Because the other one looks like a tampon.
I'm gonna gag and die. Gross.

38:23.802 --> 38:27.347
Whoa. That's quite a talent you got there.

38:28.098 --> 38:29.182
Thanks.

38:29.265 --> 38:34.062
Normally, street art, it scares me,
but this is very pretty.

38:35.939 --> 38:37.357
I wasn't goin' for pretty.

38:37.440 --> 38:41.111
Oh. Well, I...
I like how it tells a story.

38:41.194 --> 38:43.404
How love gives you legs to stand on,

38:43.488 --> 38:47.033
and without it, you're just
a disgusting, deformed cripple.

38:47.117 --> 38:48.409
Can I help you with something?

38:48.493 --> 38:50.161
Oh, it's funny you should ask.

38:50.245 --> 38:53.081
Actually, I was wondering
if I could borrow some of your paints.

38:53.164 --> 38:55.375
My husband's on his way, and I...

38:55.458 --> 38:59.921
I want to make him somethin' special
to tell him the good news.

39:00.005 --> 39:01.547
We're havin' a baby.

39:03.799 --> 39:05.801
That's not always good news.

39:06.594 --> 39:08.679
Of course it is.

39:08.763 --> 39:10.974
- Oh, you don't know my Vinnie.
- I don't have to.

39:11.057 --> 39:12.433
They're all the same.

39:12.517 --> 39:14.519
As soon as shit gets real, they run.

39:14.602 --> 39:16.187
Even if they only have one fucking leg.

39:16.812 --> 39:19.065
What Vinnie and me have is different.

39:19.149 --> 39:20.816
We made vows.

39:20.901 --> 39:23.278
"For better or for worse,
in sickness and in health."

39:24.112 --> 39:25.947
He would never do that to me.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.118
Just borrow the blue.

39:30.201 --> 39:33.746
Oh, it's another sign! It's a boy!

39:34.247 --> 39:35.331
Thank you.

39:36.457 --> 39:40.211
The glory of revolt.
It's like looking in a history textbook.

39:40.295 --> 39:43.298
One made possible
by fetal alcohol syndrome.

39:43.381 --> 39:44.715
Interesting.

39:45.758 --> 39:48.803
- I was thinking more shaken baby.
- Hmm.

39:50.013 --> 39:51.264
Mmm-hmm.

39:52.432 --> 39:56.144
I had thought about art history,
but it just didn't seem practical.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.830
Yeah, I once thought about art history,
and then I passed out drunk.

39:59.940 --> 40:01.274
Damn.

40:01.357 --> 40:04.402
That's a real nice necklace you got.

40:04.485 --> 40:07.072
Personally, I think it'd be cuter on me.

40:07.155 --> 40:09.908
- What you think?
- Yeah.

40:09.991 --> 40:11.867
Shit will make your eyes pop.

40:11.952 --> 40:14.287
Whoa, now back the fuck off.
Come on.

40:14.370 --> 40:16.581
Oh, look like butchy want to play.

40:16.664 --> 40:17.748
Ooh.

40:17.832 --> 40:20.376
Anybody ever tell you size matters?

40:20.961 --> 40:22.003
Motherfucker.

40:22.712 --> 40:24.047
Yeah, fuck off.

40:24.130 --> 40:27.383
That's right.
And it's Mr. Butch to you!

40:28.301 --> 40:29.385
Oh, my God.

40:35.641 --> 40:37.393
God! Fuck.

40:44.109 --> 40:45.276
Holy shit!

40:50.323 --> 40:51.532
What's wrong with him?

40:51.616 --> 40:53.326
It's like half of him is very sad.

40:53.409 --> 40:55.620
Hey, pudding face.
Wake up.

40:55.703 --> 40:57.163
We need your passcode.

40:57.247 --> 40:59.290
Christ. He's a vegetable.

40:59.374 --> 41:01.792
We don't need his brain.
Just his finger.

41:01.876 --> 41:03.294
What are you talking about?

41:04.045 --> 41:07.173
See? It uses a fingerprint.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.760
We are living in the future.

41:11.802 --> 41:13.013
Or they are.

41:13.096 --> 41:14.740
- Someone is.
- Now it's time for the other one.

41:17.767 --> 41:20.228
- What is he doin' here?
- Trying to be a hero.

41:20.311 --> 41:23.106
Quick. Create a diversion
while I get the fingerprint.

41:23.189 --> 41:25.441
- How?
- You're a woman. How?

41:25.525 --> 41:27.027
- Use your sexuality.
- Okay.

41:29.570 --> 41:30.989
Fucking Bond villain.

41:31.656 --> 41:33.116
This side feels a bit tender.

41:33.199 --> 41:36.619
- Is that okay for you?
- Yeah, that... that's good.

41:36.702 --> 41:39.164
- Hey.
- Can I help you?

41:39.955 --> 41:42.458
Do you come often to this place?

41:42.542 --> 41:44.335
I work here, so yes.

41:44.919 --> 41:47.630
I work here, too. I'm an inmate.

42:02.020 --> 42:04.480
What? No, no, no.

42:13.114 --> 42:14.449
I'm not gonna give you drugs.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.451
I don't want drugs.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.203
I want romance.

42:18.286 --> 42:19.662
He isn't interested.

42:19.745 --> 42:21.206
Quiet, grandma.

42:21.289 --> 42:22.790
Okay, I think you need to leave.

42:22.873 --> 42:26.169
That's right.
He's my Bollywood prince.

42:26.252 --> 42:28.796
- Psst.
- Fine. You can have him.

42:31.591 --> 42:33.718
- Oh.
- Did you get it?

42:36.679 --> 42:38.889
Oh. Smart.

42:38.973 --> 42:42.310
And then the princess kissed the knight,

42:42.393 --> 42:44.354
and they ran away from the castle

42:44.437 --> 42:49.442
to a place where her parents
could never find them.

42:51.611 --> 42:53.529
And then they lived happily...

42:54.739 --> 42:55.865
ever...

42:58.409 --> 42:59.410
after!

43:01.121 --> 43:02.872
Until she got pregnant.

43:02.955 --> 43:05.875
And then it was all "baby" this
and "nursery" that.

43:05.958 --> 43:09.837
She even stopped performing oral sex.
Had to do with the hormones.

43:09.921 --> 43:12.799
And suddenly he realized,
"This isn't where I want to be.

43:13.466 --> 43:15.050
I'm a fuckin' knight.

43:16.427 --> 43:18.263
I was born to kill."

43:18.929 --> 43:20.640
And in that moment, he understood...

43:22.933 --> 43:24.269
that he had to disappear.

43:26.687 --> 43:29.482
Into the night.

43:31.526 --> 43:34.195
Uh... I got nothin'.

43:35.113 --> 43:39.575
When in doubt, go with dragons.

43:40.410 --> 43:41.827
I'm gonna be honest.

43:41.911 --> 43:45.665
- I think that Josh boy...
- want it.

43:45.748 --> 43:48.293
He got that thirsty look in his eye.

43:49.084 --> 43:52.797
He could also just be thirsty, like...

43:52.880 --> 43:54.507
for water.

43:54.590 --> 43:55.633
Man.

43:55.716 --> 43:58.511
Why you gotta throw salt
in my game? Like...

43:59.887 --> 44:01.722
Yo, it ain't that serious.

44:01.806 --> 44:04.934
My daughter used to play
that story game with her friends.

44:06.686 --> 44:10.064
We used to have sleepovers
at my house during summer.

44:10.981 --> 44:12.858
They'd set up a tent in the yard...

44:13.818 --> 44:16.196
beg me to make my famous brownies.

44:19.365 --> 44:20.658
You miss her, huh?

44:21.534 --> 44:22.910
You have no idea.

44:27.039 --> 44:28.874
I'll be back.

44:30.918 --> 44:32.002
You got this?

44:33.629 --> 44:34.922
Yeah, I got this.

44:39.469 --> 44:40.949
So the princess got another abortion.

44:41.011 --> 44:44.265
- What? Ugh!
- And, uh, when the king found out,

44:44.349 --> 44:47.435
he freaked and locked her in a tower
for the rest of her life.

44:49.645 --> 44:50.813
The end.

44:51.772 --> 44:53.399
That's what I would do.

44:54.942 --> 44:56.068
You guys are animals.

44:56.151 --> 44:57.152
Hey!

44:57.862 --> 45:01.241
This ain't no damn slumber party.
Back to your bunks!

45:01.324 --> 45:03.200
- Aw.
- Now!

45:03.284 --> 45:05.745
- Aw, man.
- Fucking guards, man.

45:10.583 --> 45:11.834
My wife is in there.

45:11.917 --> 45:14.670
I don't care if Taylor Swift is in there.
No one's gettin' in.

45:14.754 --> 45:17.214
- This is bullshit.
- Okay, sir.

45:17.298 --> 45:19.943
What's your name? Hopper?
Is there somebody else I can talk to?

45:19.967 --> 45:21.808
- Somebody in charge?
- No, I'm in charge, sir.

45:23.554 --> 45:24.597
Vinnie!

45:24.680 --> 45:27.360
- Guys, we got a woman on the roof.
- Vinnie, I'm over here!

45:27.933 --> 45:28.934
Look at this.

45:29.018 --> 45:30.899
- Over here!
- Come on. Let's go.

45:30.978 --> 45:33.398
- Vinnie!
- That what I think it is?

45:33.481 --> 45:35.065
It's a surrender.

45:35.149 --> 45:37.151
Oh. Oh, shoot.

45:37.234 --> 45:38.694
There are words on it.

45:39.362 --> 45:41.864
- "Lasagna in the oven"?
- Vinnie!

45:41.947 --> 45:44.992
- Jesus, is that a threat?
- Holy shit.

45:45.075 --> 45:48.288
Honey, do you get it?
It's our hilarious joke!

45:48.954 --> 45:50.873
I don't think he can hear you.

45:50.956 --> 45:53.167
That woman looks mentally ill.

45:53.876 --> 45:56.587
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- Your wife, I take it?

45:56.671 --> 45:58.756
No. Wrong prison.
Excuse me.

45:58.839 --> 46:00.520
- Excuse me.
- I love you!

46:01.551 --> 46:02.760
Honey!

46:02.843 --> 46:03.969
Vinnie!

46:04.887 --> 46:07.848
- Where are you going?
- Maybe he got diarrhea.

46:08.849 --> 46:10.643
No, he doesn't have diarrhea.

46:12.478 --> 46:13.747
Vinnie!

46:13.771 --> 46:16.231
Where is he go... Vinnie!

46:16.316 --> 46:18.526
Vinnie, honey, I'm here!

46:18.609 --> 46:21.737
Vinnie, where are you going?
I'm right here!

46:21.821 --> 46:24.615
Vinnie! No, don't go!

46:26.241 --> 46:28.578
Maybe you should've went
with another metaphor.

46:48.180 --> 46:49.515
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

47:09.326 --> 47:11.579
- I hope it's a book burning.
- Fingers crossed.

47:26.844 --> 47:29.304
Hi, everyone. Um...

47:30.264 --> 47:32.141
Uh, thank you for bringing your books.

47:33.601 --> 47:35.936
In honor of Poussey,

47:36.020 --> 47:40.400
I'd like to welcome you all to the new
Litchfield Community Library.

47:40.483 --> 47:45.863
Now, as you can see, it's no longer
just one room, but it's everywhere.

47:45.946 --> 47:48.866
Um, so just take your book,
replace it with another.

47:48.949 --> 47:49.992
Kind of like a book swap.

47:50.075 --> 47:54.329
And no, uh, smoking,
'cause, like, you know, paper.

47:54.414 --> 47:56.206
Um, and no stealing.

47:57.041 --> 47:59.168
And no flash photography.

47:59.251 --> 48:01.962
Just be respectful.
Okay.

48:03.881 --> 48:06.341
- Oh, wow. Nice.
- Wow.

48:35.120 --> 48:36.288
So simple.

48:37.372 --> 48:39.291
Maybe I should learn how to read.

48:56.851 --> 48:59.353
You brought her favorite.

49:00.312 --> 49:02.732
Listen, I'm sorry about last night.

49:03.816 --> 49:09.029
I was drunk and insensitive and rude,
and you did not deserve that.

49:09.113 --> 49:10.280
It's okay.

49:11.699 --> 49:13.158
No, it's not.

49:14.827 --> 49:16.746
I know how much she meant to you.

49:18.455 --> 49:20.290
And how much you meant to her.

49:22.585 --> 49:24.169
Look, I get it.

49:24.253 --> 49:27.089
Trust me. I'm pissed off, just like you.

49:27.172 --> 49:28.382
I ain't hungry.

49:29.341 --> 49:30.510
I can't sleep.

49:31.511 --> 49:33.971
And every time I close my eyes, I see her.

49:37.349 --> 49:39.434
At least you're doing something about it.

49:40.435 --> 49:41.896
It don't matter.

49:42.813 --> 49:44.356
She ain't comin' back.

50:11.383 --> 50:14.261
It ain't no Dewey decimal system, but...

50:15.888 --> 50:17.848
it's all right.

50:39.787 --> 50:40.830
Hot, baby!

50:40.913 --> 50:42.748
- Hey. Okay?
- All right.

50:59.849 --> 51:01.684
Another work of art.

51:03.352 --> 51:05.771
You're, like, the Basquiat to my Warhol.

51:07.022 --> 51:08.398
I was gonna say that.

51:27.668 --> 51:29.670
Wait. When is the last time you showered?

51:29.754 --> 51:31.505
You smell like burnt Cheetos.

51:32.464 --> 51:33.548
Oh, shut up.

51:37.302 --> 51:39.429
Are those braids?

51:50.190 --> 51:52.192
Uh-oh.

51:52.276 --> 51:53.736
Pothead alert.

51:59.366 --> 52:03.287
- What the...
- Yes! Signal booster's working. I rule.

52:10.878 --> 52:13.213
Who's Benny?
Your boyfriend?

52:16.216 --> 52:17.217
No.

52:19.261 --> 52:20.637
My son.

52:27.352 --> 52:28.979
How about the little scared cryin' face?

52:29.063 --> 52:30.314
No!

52:30.397 --> 52:33.025
We have to get inside the man's head.

52:33.108 --> 52:36.611
We need Piscatella to believe
he's actually talking to Humphrey.

52:36.696 --> 52:41.658
I see. So you're sayin'
knife, gun, bomb, then prayers' hands.

52:41.742 --> 52:43.577
Oh, give that to me.

52:45.079 --> 52:46.413
"Piscatella...

52:47.581 --> 52:48.833
it's Humps.

52:50.459 --> 52:52.753
We need your help.

52:53.670 --> 52:55.172
Are you there?"

52:56.716 --> 52:59.259
See? Simple, clean.

53:02.805 --> 53:04.890
I still feel it's missing something.

53:20.489 --> 53:21.698
Sorry. We're out.

53:21.782 --> 53:23.617
I waited 20 fucking minutes!

53:23.700 --> 53:25.661
What happened to the cold brew?
It was right here.

53:25.745 --> 53:27.246
I don't know.
Ask your partner.

53:28.372 --> 53:30.582
Oh, hell no.
I know you ain't calling me a thief.

53:30.665 --> 53:33.377
- I sure as hell didn't take it.
- Never trust a white bitch.

53:33.460 --> 53:35.087
Who you callin' a bitch, spic?

53:35.170 --> 53:36.964
Who you calling a spic, cracker?

53:39.133 --> 53:42.094
- They ain't got no coffee!
- What?

53:58.986 --> 54:00.195
Who was that?

54:01.613 --> 54:02.948
Nobody.

54:03.032 --> 54:04.366
What?

54:04.449 --> 54:07.244
Lourdes, I can't hear you.

54:07.327 --> 54:08.662
Stop crying.

54:10.080 --> 54:11.540
What hospital is he in?

54:12.582 --> 54:13.625
What?

54:14.543 --> 54:16.336
Stop crying. I can't hear you.

54:17.504 --> 54:20.007
Well... well, what did the doctor say?

54:24.219 --> 54:25.720
Lourdes, listen to me!

54:27.097 --> 54:29.308
What did the doctor say, Lourdes?

54:38.775 --> 54:40.319
What are you doing?
Let go of me!

54:40.402 --> 54:41.987
What are you doing?

54:42.071 --> 54:43.655
No! It's for the community!

54:43.738 --> 54:46.200
Leanne, no! Please, no!

54:46.283 --> 54:47.868
Let go of me.
