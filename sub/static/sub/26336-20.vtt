This was a bad idea before,
now it's a really bad idea.

00:43.675 --> 00:47.276
I thought that you might
say that. Um...

00:47.345 --> 00:50.747
- $350. That makes $500 total.
- No way, dude.

Spend all day cleaning up

our fine feral friend here.

02:02.053 --> 02:04.310
Well, if you took this job
for glamour and excitement,

02:04.334 --> 02:05.663
you're gonna be disappointed.

02:05.687 --> 02:07.113
And I suppose,
since you outrank me,

02:07.137 --> 02:09.169
I'm gonna be the one

Hey. Oh!

02:26.809 --> 02:28.542
Man.

02:28.610 --> 02:30.577
Hilo, it's good
to see you, my man.

02:30.646 --> 02:33.380
- How you doing?
- Aw... Wow.

02:33.449 --> 02:34.614
You really stepped up.

02:34.683 --> 02:36.349
A long way from sleeping

02:36.418 --> 02:38.885
on a cot at St. Augustine's.
- Yeah.

02:38.954 --> 02:41.088
Hey, uh, what about you, man?

02:41.156 --> 02:44.224
You still, uh, sleeping
at the shelter?

02:44.293 --> 02:46.193
I try.

02:47.629 --> 02:49.340
You know, just to keep me out
of trouble most of the time,

02:49.364 --> 02:51.498
at least.

02:51.567 --> 02:55.902
Hilo... what's going on?

02:55.971 --> 02:59.773
I did something really
stupid yesterday.

02:59.842 --> 03:01.141
What type of gun?

03:01.210 --> 03:03.210
A revolver--
a .38, old.

03:03.278 --> 03:06.113
You, uh, you didn't-- you didn't
get the girl's name, right?

03:06.181 --> 03:07.181
No.

03:07.216 --> 03:08.749
JUNIOR: But he did
give a description,

03:08.817 --> 03:11.218
and I've already alerted HPD.

03:11.286 --> 03:12.630
Get that description
to all the other high schools

03:12.654 --> 03:14.774
on the Island, all right,
then tighten their security.

03:14.823 --> 03:17.591
You know, school shootings are
rarely female, and it's a .38.

03:17.659 --> 03:20.427
A six-shot revolver is not
usually the weapon of choice.

03:20.496 --> 03:21.854
I'm sorry, man,
I should've stopped it.

03:21.878 --> 03:22.630
Hey, hey.

03:22.631 --> 03:25.365
This guy that you know
that set up the sale,

03:25.434 --> 03:26.900
how do we find him?

03:26.969 --> 03:28.179
The money that Ioane got
for the gun

03:28.203 --> 03:29.481
will keep him high
for two or three days.

03:29.505 --> 03:30.437
I wouldn't count on him

03:30.506 --> 03:32.739
showing his face
until the drugs run out.

03:32.808 --> 03:34.219
DANNY: I got a question.
This guy set it up.

03:34.243 --> 03:37.778
Right? So why was he surprised
to see a teenage girl?

03:37.846 --> 03:41.615
Ioane thought he was smart
and-and super anonymous.

03:41.683 --> 03:42.994
He-he set up the buy
at the website.

03:43.018 --> 03:44.329
I don't know the name,
but I do know that

03:44.353 --> 03:47.587
he used a computer
at a public library in Wai'anae.

03:47.656 --> 03:49.790
Junior, have Adam and Jerry
head over there.

03:49.858 --> 03:51.758
Pull the files of
all the computers,

03:51.827 --> 03:53.037
see if they can help us
I.D. this girl.

03:53.061 --> 03:54.172
Have him sit down
with a sketch artist,

03:54.196 --> 03:55.507
see if he can come up
with a composite.

03:55.531 --> 03:57.964
On it. Hilo, with me.

03:59.034 --> 04:00.767
I'm gonna reach out to HPD,

04:00.836 --> 04:03.970
have them, uh, alert us
to any and all activity

04:04.039 --> 04:06.873
that involves a .38 slug
on the Island.

04:06.942 --> 04:08.675
Ah, you know,
look, she, ah,

04:08.744 --> 04:10.555
obviously went through a lot
of trouble to get that gun.

04:10.579 --> 04:11.812
<i>She probably has a plan.</i>

04:11.880 --> 04:13.258
STEVE: <i>Yeah, and we probably</i>

05:09.504 --> 05:10.437
Never mind.

05:10.505 --> 05:11.605
Just a moment, please.

05:11.673 --> 05:13.440
John, the phone's
for you.

05:13.508 --> 05:16.509
That was quite a stunt.

05:16.578 --> 05:21.014
Say, you're the star
of <i>The Captain Outrageous Show.</i>

05:21.083 --> 05:22.816
This is John McGarrett.

05:22.885 --> 05:24.128
LUKELA (over phone):
He's got a gun on me.

05:24.152 --> 05:25.652
He wants you to meet him.

05:25.721 --> 05:26.853
Got it.

05:26.922 --> 05:28.221
I'm on my way.

05:35.831 --> 05:39.432
Hey... I have to go to work.

05:39.501 --> 05:41.701
Take care of your mom
while I'm gone, okay?

05:41.770 --> 05:43.003
Okay?

05:49.611 --> 05:51.711
I have to go.
I love you.

05:51.780 --> 05:53.647
DORIS:
John, if something was wrong,

05:53.715 --> 05:55.615
you would tell
me, right?

05:55.684 --> 05:57.684
JOHN: I'm not gonna lie
to you. I don't know.

05:57.753 --> 05:59.352
Just lock the
door behind me.

05:59.421 --> 06:01.922
I'll try to call you as soon
as I get this straightened out.

06:01.990 --> 06:03.790
(door opens, shuts)

06:13.702 --> 06:15.936
As I live and breathe.

06:18.473 --> 06:19.739
Let him go, Hester.

06:21.209 --> 06:23.777
Don't worry, you're
gonna be all right.

06:23.845 --> 06:25.111
You heard me, cut him loose.

06:26.315 --> 06:29.282
I'm here now, alone, unarmed.

06:29.351 --> 06:31.551
Didn't call it in,
just like you asked.

06:31.620 --> 06:33.887
You're such a good boy, John.

06:37.225 --> 06:40.327
.38. I take it that's the
murder weapon we never found.

06:40.395 --> 06:42.262
The very one.

06:42.331 --> 06:43.797
I stashed it well

06:43.865 --> 06:47.100
and picked it up
the day I got out.

06:47.169 --> 06:48.780
Should've had you on murder
instead of man 2.

06:48.804 --> 06:50.370
Ten years was light.

06:50.439 --> 06:51.805
I shouldn't have served a day.

06:51.873 --> 06:54.374
He was stealing from <i>me.</i>

06:54.443 --> 06:56.376
From a company we
built together.

06:56.445 --> 07:00.447
Besides, it was--
it was self-defense.

07:00.515 --> 07:02.649
A jury of your peers disagreed.

07:04.720 --> 07:07.520
Ten years, John.

07:07.589 --> 07:09.422
Long time.

07:10.625 --> 07:15.161
More than enough to
lose... everything.

07:15.230 --> 07:17.097
The company, for one.
I'm broke.

07:17.165 --> 07:21.001
My wife... left.

07:21.069 --> 07:25.772
My son stopped talking to me.

07:25.841 --> 07:30.510
Prefers his new dad.
Or so I'm told.

07:32.214 --> 07:33.780
Honestly, I don't blame him.

07:33.849 --> 07:37.717
You made sure he grew up
without a father.

07:40.055 --> 07:42.522
(thunder rumbles)

07:42.591 --> 07:45.158
Heard you have a boy
of your own.

07:45.227 --> 07:46.893
Steve, right?

07:48.663 --> 07:51.998
CSU found a slug. .38.

07:52.067 --> 07:53.767
It was fired at close range.

07:53.835 --> 07:55.435
Single gunshot to the chest.

07:55.504 --> 07:57.315
The slug's in pretty bad
condition, so it's unlikely

07:57.339 --> 07:58.516
we're gonna get
a ballistics hit.

07:58.540 --> 08:00.407
(siren approaching)

08:00.475 --> 08:04.077
So, our girl buys a .38,
and less than 24 hours later,

08:04.146 --> 08:05.745
this guy's shot dead with one?

08:05.814 --> 08:08.681
Well, not too many .38s
on the street these days.

08:08.750 --> 08:10.361
I'd say she's more
than likely our shooter.

08:10.385 --> 08:12.318
- We I.D. the vic?
- Yeah.

08:12.387 --> 08:13.753
Michael Carrigan, 43.

08:13.822 --> 08:16.256
He's got a bunch of priors,
including misdemeanor assault

08:16.324 --> 08:17.991
and B and E.

08:18.060 --> 08:19.604
He also had his license
suspended for a DUI,

08:19.628 --> 08:21.661
which might explain
why he's out here

08:21.730 --> 08:23.241
drinking in the early hours
of the morning.

08:23.265 --> 08:26.399
There's a liquor store within
walking distance from here.

08:27.903 --> 08:31.538
Well, this looks to me like
a regular drinking spot here.

08:31.606 --> 08:32.984
I mean, if this was
a premeditated hit,

08:33.008 --> 08:34.107
then it would explain

08:34.176 --> 08:35.909
how our shooter knew
where to find him, no?

08:35.977 --> 08:36.909
TANI:
Yeah, I agree.

08:36.977 --> 08:38.477
Assuming it was our
teenage girl,

08:38.547 --> 08:41.114
what's the connection
with this guy, then?

08:41.183 --> 08:43.450
Junior described her
as suburban, clean-cut.

08:43.518 --> 08:45.085
Yeah, clean-cut, carrying a .38.

08:46.822 --> 08:48.822
STEVE: Yeah, with one less bullet
in it.

08:55.596 --> 08:57.863
JUNIOR: Okay, so sketch artist
just sent this over.

08:57.932 --> 09:00.628
HPD's distributing this image
to all schools island-wide.

09:00.629 --> 09:02.234
And they are also going
to keep Hilo on ice

09:02.235 --> 09:03.568
until this thing plays out.

09:03.637 --> 09:05.603
Well, in the meantime,
I looked a little deeper

09:05.672 --> 09:07.372
into our vic Michael Carrigan.

09:08.441 --> 09:10.041
Carrigan was single,
he had no kids.

09:10.110 --> 09:12.877
His last known address
was with his grandmother.

09:12.946 --> 09:14.479
He was stacking boxes
in a warehouse,

09:14.548 --> 09:16.014
and when I talked to his boss,

09:16.082 --> 09:18.550
he told me that he was
well liked, hard-working,

09:18.618 --> 09:20.852
never had any problems
with anybody that he knew of.

09:20.921 --> 09:22.854
He worked the graveyard shift
last night,

09:22.923 --> 09:24.889
knocked off 7:00 a.m.

09:24.958 --> 09:26.624
He gets off work,
goes and buys a bottle,

09:26.693 --> 09:28.359
then finds a nice place
to drink it,

09:28.428 --> 09:30.562
then gets capped by
a kid in junior high.

09:30.630 --> 09:32.964
Hey, so I just got off
the phone with Noelani.

09:33.033 --> 09:35.533
Approximate time of death
was 9:00 a.m.

09:35.602 --> 09:40.305
She also was able to determine
his blood alcohol level: .17.

09:40.373 --> 09:41.509
Wow, he was wasted.

09:41.510 --> 09:45.043
Also, Noelani found blood
and skin tissue

09:45.111 --> 09:46.978
under his fingernails.

09:47.047 --> 09:49.247
It typed as female DNA
not in the system.

09:49.316 --> 09:50.526
GROVER:
Yet another piece of evidence

09:50.550 --> 09:53.451
pointing to our Ms. Jane Doe
as the shooter.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.197
This still doesn't explain
why she wanted him killed.

09:55.221 --> 09:56.354
We got to dig deeper.

09:56.423 --> 09:57.767
We got to find
some connective tissue

09:57.791 --> 09:59.857
between this guy and our UnSub.

09:59.926 --> 10:01.793
Until then, we need
to focus on

10:01.861 --> 10:03.494
getting that gun off the street.

10:13.139 --> 10:14.672
Yes, yes, it was
a really good flight.

10:14.741 --> 10:15.885
You know why it was
a good flight?

10:15.909 --> 10:18.076
Because they didn't lose
my luggage.

10:18.144 --> 10:19.477
All right, monkey,
time for bed.

10:19.546 --> 10:20.612
I love you very much,

10:20.680 --> 10:21.824
and I can't wait
to see you tomorrow.

10:21.848 --> 10:24.682
All right?
All right, monkey, good night.

10:24.751 --> 10:26.718
My man.

10:26.786 --> 10:27.964
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.

10:27.988 --> 10:29.787
You have anything, um, like,

10:29.856 --> 10:31.289
substantial to eat
in this place?

10:31.358 --> 10:32.957
- Yeah, right over there.
- Right here?

10:33.026 --> 10:36.628
- Yeah.
- Interesting.

10:36.696 --> 10:38.463
I don't know what that is.
Spam musubi.

10:38.531 --> 10:41.032
Sorry? Can't
even say that.

10:41.101 --> 10:42.901
You have anything that comes
from a cow maybe?

10:42.936 --> 10:45.570
Yeah, try the freezer. We have
some White Castle there.

10:45.639 --> 10:46.244
Oh, good.

10:46.268 --> 10:48.107
And the microwave's
over by the ice chest.

10:48.108 --> 10:50.274
Okay. Great.

10:50.343 --> 10:52.310
You here on vacation?

10:52.379 --> 10:54.545
Uh, no, I, uh, start
a new job here tomorrow.

10:54.614 --> 10:57.649
Uh, this island
grows on you.

10:57.717 --> 10:59.751
That's what I hear,
that's what I hear.

10:59.786 --> 11:01.719
Try taking the tie off.
That might be a start.

11:01.788 --> 11:03.921
Yeah, I-I hear that, too.

11:10.263 --> 11:12.697
Give me the cash! Now!

11:13.700 --> 11:14.966
Come on!

11:15.035 --> 11:16.501
Come on!

11:16.569 --> 11:19.337
(cash register beeping)

11:19.406 --> 11:20.872
- Excuse me, sir.
- Shut up!

11:20.940 --> 11:22.040
Okay.

11:22.108 --> 11:24.242
All right.
Just, I-I...

11:24.310 --> 11:26.411
- Hey! You got a death wish?
- No, no, no.

11:26.479 --> 11:27.512
- Shut up.
-Okay.

11:27.580 --> 11:30.014
Just relax, please.
Just stay calm.

11:30.083 --> 11:32.517
You can run, nobody's gonna
see you, nobody knows...

11:32.585 --> 11:33.651
All right,
relax, relax.

11:33.720 --> 11:34.886
Relax, just relax.

11:34.954 --> 11:36.054
Hands up!

11:39.259 --> 11:40.358
(microwave beeps)
(gasps)

11:40.427 --> 11:41.359
(gasps)

11:41.428 --> 11:42.694
No, no, no, no!
(gunshot)

11:42.762 --> 11:43.762
(woman screams)

11:55.608 --> 11:57.642
Hey, hey. Come here,
come here.

12:00.480 --> 12:03.181
Come here. Listen to me.
I want you to keep

12:03.249 --> 12:05.369
pressure on this, okay,
until the ambulance gets here.

12:05.418 --> 12:06.962
Do not let up on this
until the ambulance gets here,

12:06.986 --> 12:09.921
you understand? You're gonna be
okay, all right? Allight?

12:19.666 --> 12:21.043
(glass shatters)
(car alarm blaring)

12:21.067 --> 12:23.534
HPD! Come out
with your hands up!

12:44.657 --> 12:45.757
(grunts)

12:52.332 --> 12:54.732
Hey! HPD. Stop.

12:54.801 --> 12:56.033
Stop!

13:15.121 --> 13:17.155
(panting)

13:21.494 --> 13:23.427
Son of a bitch.

13:25.732 --> 13:27.932
(phone dialing)

13:28.001 --> 13:30.668
OPERATOR:
911. What is your emergency?

13:30.737 --> 13:33.404
Yeah, this is
Detective Danny Williams.

13:33.473 --> 13:35.573
I don't have
a badge number yet.

13:35.642 --> 13:39.977
Failed pursuit of the gunman
from the robbery on Colburn.

13:40.046 --> 13:44.115
Suspect is armed with a .38.
Last seen at the corner of...

13:44.184 --> 13:46.984
Mokauea... and Ahuula.

13:47.053 --> 13:49.053
I don't, I don't know
where I am.

13:49.122 --> 13:53.224
Dispatching units to the area
immediately, Detective.

13:53.293 --> 13:54.892
(phone beeps)

13:59.866 --> 14:02.567
Please tell me you got something
from the library.

14:02.635 --> 14:04.735
Yeah, a lot.
We found the computer

14:04.804 --> 14:06.537
Hilo's friend used
to sell the gun.

14:06.606 --> 14:09.540
Web history shows he listed it
on a shady website,

14:09.609 --> 14:11.676
uh, it's kind of
a wannabe Armslist.

14:11.744 --> 14:14.245
The buyer's account
was created four days ago.

14:14.314 --> 14:16.414
He used a dummy
e-mail account,

14:16.482 --> 14:19.317
but I think I can trace
the IP address.

14:22.589 --> 14:23.855
Here we go.

14:23.923 --> 14:26.068
Uh, it traces back to Wilkinson
High School. Looks like

14:26.092 --> 14:27.803
the e-mail was sent from
their computer lab.

14:27.827 --> 14:29.538
Wilkinson is a public school
out in Wahiawa.

14:29.562 --> 14:32.048
There's easily over
1,000 students there.

14:32.049 --> 14:33.638
We got to reach out
to the school right away.

14:33.662 --> 14:35.662
Get a copy of their yearbook, and get

14:35.668 --> 14:37.501
Junior's friend back up
here to make an I.D.

14:39.405 --> 14:41.873
OWEN:
<i>So, uh,</i>

14:41.941 --> 14:43.441
what's this about?

14:43.509 --> 14:45.576
Before we get into it, uh,
I've been trying to get

14:45.645 --> 14:46.711
in touch with
Bonnie's mom.

14:46.779 --> 14:47.923
I can't seem to get
ahold of her.

14:47.947 --> 14:49.981
- You know where she is?
-Sh...

14:50.049 --> 14:51.415
Like he would have any idea. No.

14:51.484 --> 14:52.964
They only communicate
through lawyers.

14:53.019 --> 14:54.452
(sighs)

14:54.520 --> 14:56.854
I, uh, I-I don't know, sorry.

14:56.923 --> 15:00.024
Can you guys just tell me
why I was dragged out of class?

15:00.093 --> 15:01.425
Yeah.

15:01.494 --> 15:04.295
This man's name
is Michael Carrigan.

15:04.364 --> 15:06.564
Okay. So?

15:06.633 --> 15:08.633
Uh, he was killed
this morning. Uh,

15:08.701 --> 15:10.401
the gun used
was a-a .38.

15:10.470 --> 15:11.936
STEVE: You see,
the thing is, Bonnie,

15:12.005 --> 15:13.704
we have somebody who was present

15:13.773 --> 15:15.806
at the gun sale yesterday.
They say

15:15.875 --> 15:17.308
you bought that
gun in Waialua

15:17.377 --> 15:19.310
off a junkie.
- Wait, wait, wait, what?

15:19.379 --> 15:21.946
I don't know what
you're talking about.

15:22.015 --> 15:23.655
Uh, hang on a second here.
You're accusing

15:23.683 --> 15:25.950
my-my daughter of murder
based on what?

15:26.019 --> 15:27.685
The gun sale
was arranged online,

15:27.754 --> 15:29.487
and we traced
the buyer's IP address

15:29.555 --> 15:31.722
to a computer at this school.
Okay, we also have

15:31.791 --> 15:33.291
an eyewitness who was there

15:33.359 --> 15:35.993
and said Bonnie bought that gun,
so I have to ask you again,

15:36.062 --> 15:37.995
Bonnie, how do you know
Michael Carrigan?

15:38.064 --> 15:39.430
I don't.

15:39.499 --> 15:41.299
DANNY: Well, we'd like
to do a-a DNA test,

15:41.367 --> 15:45.102
uh, to rule you out, also a
thing called a cordite test

15:45.171 --> 15:47.672
where we check your clothes
for, uh, gunshot residue.

15:47.707 --> 15:49.640
No, no. She's not
submitting to anything.

15:49.709 --> 15:51.075
I'm sorry,
Mr. Pearsen,

15:51.144 --> 15:53.077
we're, uh, we're-we're
not done here.

15:53.146 --> 15:56.180
No, I think we are. All you have
is the word of a drug addict

15:56.249 --> 15:58.282
and-and a computer at a school

15:58.351 --> 16:00.484
with over 1,000 kids
in it, right?

16:00.553 --> 16:03.193
So unless you're willing to put the cuffs
on my daughter right now,

16:03.256 --> 16:06.357
conversation's over.

16:06.426 --> 16:07.992
Now, I got to get back

16:08.061 --> 16:10.261
to work, all right?
Come on, Bonnie.

16:10.330 --> 16:11.729
I'm taking you home.

16:21.934 --> 16:24.243
ADAM: We scoured Bonnie's
e-mail, social media accounts,

16:24.244 --> 16:27.650
the works. Nothing as far
as a connection to our victim,

16:27.651 --> 16:29.684
so we started looking
into her parents.

16:29.753 --> 16:31.953
Her dad's not active on the
interwebs, but her mom is,

16:32.022 --> 16:33.255
especially
on Facebook.

16:33.323 --> 16:36.825
Three weeks ago,
Kiana Pearsen posted this photo.

16:36.894 --> 16:40.295
It's of her and Bonnie at a
restaurant, along with this guy.

16:43.934 --> 16:46.167
- Michael Carrigan.
TANI: Wow, chummy.

16:46.236 --> 16:48.537
Looks like Bonnie's mom
was dating our vic.

16:48.605 --> 16:50.872
Right, so why'd she claim
she didn't know him?

16:50.941 --> 16:52.852
Hey, Jerry, where are we at
with tracking the mother?

16:52.876 --> 16:54.387
I tried pinging her phone
but it's off.

16:54.411 --> 16:56.356
I'm gonna have to pull
call records and see what that gets us.

16:56.380 --> 16:57.857
I'll get her picture out
to ports and airports.

16:57.881 --> 16:59.192
Okay, good.
Let's get a search team

16:59.216 --> 17:00.549
over to the mother's house.
Tani,

17:00.617 --> 17:02.350
grab Junior, head to
the father's house.

17:02.419 --> 17:04.486
We need to bring Bonnie in.

17:05.589 --> 17:08.455
- Hey!
WOMAN: Hey!

17:08.525 --> 17:10.692
Hi!
What's up, girl?

17:10.761 --> 17:12.827
Hey!
Hey, how are you?

- How was your shift?
-Pretty good.

17:41.692 --> 17:42.824
I'm glad you're
here now.

17:45.696 --> 17:47.195
MAN: Yeah.
(gunshot)

17:47.264 --> 17:49.130
(people screaming)
(gunshots continue)

17:49.199 --> 17:51.533
WOMAN:
Is that a gunshot?

17:54.271 --> 17:55.937
MALEKO: Yeah, little man
nailed it again.

17:56.006 --> 17:58.039
(laughs)
MAN: Get 'em, brah.

17:58.108 --> 18:00.909
- Yo, I want one of these.
- Koa? What are you doing here?

18:00.978 --> 18:02.811
KOA:
Just...

18:02.879 --> 18:05.313
- Where the hell did you get that?
MALEKO: From me. Relax,

18:05.382 --> 18:06.826
Tani, kid's just got to have
a little fun.

18:06.850 --> 18:08.249
Is someone talking to you?

18:08.318 --> 18:10.318
DAMIN: Everybody chill.
Back up right now.

18:10.387 --> 18:12.220
- Everybody chill.
- Get out of my face.

18:12.289 --> 18:15.056
Maleko, that ain't cool, man.

18:15.125 --> 18:17.005
This boy don't need
to be playing with a heater.

18:18.462 --> 18:19.794
Baby bro, give it here.

18:19.863 --> 18:21.630
- Give me the .38.
TANI: Koa.

18:21.698 --> 18:23.298
Give him the gun now.

18:26.403 --> 18:27.502
Okay.

18:27.571 --> 18:31.272
It's all good, right?

18:31.341 --> 18:32.785
Let's head back inside,
have another drink.

18:32.809 --> 18:34.976
I'm taking you home.

18:35.045 --> 18:36.756
What? What? Come on, no.
Shut up. Get inside now.

18:36.780 --> 18:37.979
Come on, but it
just started.

18:38.048 --> 18:40.949
- Walk, Koa. Shut up.
- It's not a big deal.

18:44.521 --> 18:45.787
Call me after.

18:45.856 --> 18:47.489
All right.

18:59.436 --> 19:02.103
Couldn't sleep?

19:02.172 --> 19:04.105
Yeah, something
like that.

19:07.377 --> 19:10.178
(sighs) Look,

19:10.247 --> 19:11.780
I said I was sorry.

19:11.848 --> 19:14.883
I spoke to the boys.
They know Koa's not in the game.

19:14.951 --> 19:16.518
They better.

19:20.424 --> 19:22.157
Look, Damien,

19:22.225 --> 19:24.526
I know what you do,
but I don't want to get

19:24.594 --> 19:25.860
my brother anywhere
near that.

19:25.929 --> 19:28.763
And he won't be, on my word.

19:31.068 --> 19:32.534
I love you.

19:34.137 --> 19:35.470
Listen.

19:35.539 --> 19:36.905
Last night,
when I was leaving,

19:36.973 --> 19:38.873
I saw you

19:38.942 --> 19:40.775
give the gun
back to Maleko.

19:43.613 --> 19:45.513
What did you
say to him?

19:45.582 --> 19:47.482
- Nothing.
- Yeah?

19:47.551 --> 19:50.218
'Cause I could've sworn that I
heard you say, "Call me after."

19:53.924 --> 19:56.357
After what?

19:56.426 --> 19:59.327
Baby, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

19:59.396 --> 20:02.897
You must've
heard me wrong.

20:02.933 --> 20:04.432
Okay?

20:04.468 --> 20:06.334
(knocking on door)

20:08.939 --> 20:11.639
(knocking continues)

20:13.176 --> 20:15.343
(pounding on door)

20:16.480 --> 20:18.580
Good morning, Mr. Bautista.

20:18.648 --> 20:19.748
I'm Detective
Belden, HPD.

20:19.816 --> 20:21.883
My partner, Detective Iosua.

20:24.321 --> 20:26.721
Your friend Maleko Pane, seems
he was spotted in the vicinity

20:26.790 --> 20:29.457
of a gun homicide last night.
The victim

20:29.526 --> 20:31.860
was from a crew that's been
beefing with yours.

20:31.928 --> 20:34.262
(echoing):
This ring any bells?

20:36.867 --> 20:37.966
DANNY:
Hey, Bonnie.

20:38.034 --> 20:40.935
All right, so you, uh,
you lied to us.

20:45.809 --> 20:47.075
I didn't kill him, I swear.

20:47.144 --> 20:48.643
But... okay, yeah,

20:48.712 --> 20:49.811
I did know him.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.357
TANI: Now that we're all
telling the truth,

20:51.381 --> 20:53.882
do you want to tell us, uh,
where we can find your mother?

20:53.950 --> 20:56.195
I don't know. I've been calling
and texting her ever since

20:56.219 --> 20:58.119
you came to my school,
but I can't get through.

20:58.188 --> 21:00.199
Hold her in the bullpen. We'll
talk when her dad gets here.

21:00.223 --> 21:03.958
No, no, no-- I, I can't talk
about this in front of him.

21:04.027 --> 21:05.160
Please, he has no idea.

21:05.228 --> 21:08.530
Listen, I-I bought
the gun, okay?

21:10.300 --> 21:12.934
Why don't you take a seat?

21:13.003 --> 21:15.014
I waited until last night
to move it to my mom's house

21:15.038 --> 21:16.304
when I knew that
that scumbag

21:16.373 --> 21:18.106
would be at work.
DANNY: Scumbag is, uh,

21:18.175 --> 21:19.207
Michael Carrigan?

21:20.677 --> 21:22.343
TANI:
All right, so,

21:22.412 --> 21:24.345
CSU's at your mother's place
right now.

21:24.414 --> 21:26.494
Would you be able to direct
them to where the gun is?

21:28.852 --> 21:32.420
Um, my bedroom closet.
There's a loose floorboard.

21:36.526 --> 21:38.493
STEVE: So, Bonnie, why'd
you buy a gun?

21:40.397 --> 21:41.996
He beats her.

21:42.065 --> 21:44.866
The past few weeks,
it's gotten a lot worse.

21:44.935 --> 21:48.603
The other day,
he knocked her unconscious.

21:50.040 --> 21:52.807
I was worried
that he would kill her.

21:52.876 --> 21:57.512
So I figured that the next time
he laid a hand on her...

21:58.515 --> 22:00.048
You'd kill him first?

22:00.116 --> 22:02.016
Okay.

22:02.085 --> 22:05.220
Does your father know that-that
Carrigan beat your mother?

22:05.288 --> 22:08.456
He didn't even know
that she had a boyfriend.

22:08.558 --> 22:11.392
Yeah, I-I didn't
tell him anything because

22:11.461 --> 22:12.839
I didn't want it
to be used against my mom

22:12.863 --> 22:13.962
in the divorce.

22:14.030 --> 22:16.564
I-I don't understand.

22:16.633 --> 22:19.634
She has issues--
uh, drinking, pills, too--

22:19.703 --> 22:23.404
just stuff that could be used
against her in a custody battle.

22:23.473 --> 22:25.084
Look, it's-it's not
that my dad's a bad guy,

22:25.108 --> 22:26.507
he's really not, it's just...

22:26.576 --> 22:29.143
I-I don't want to see my mom
any less than I already do.

22:29.212 --> 22:31.279
Okay.

22:31.348 --> 22:33.715
CSU checked the stash spot.
No gun.

22:33.783 --> 22:34.849
BONNIE:
No, it,

22:34.918 --> 22:36.718
it has to be there.
You have to believe me,

22:36.786 --> 22:38.620
I did not kill him.

22:39.890 --> 22:41.389
Guys, a word?

22:42.726 --> 22:44.959
Give us a minute, Bonnie, okay?
Just stay here.

22:49.132 --> 22:51.766
So there's another angle
to this.

22:51.835 --> 22:54.469
Parents always know where
their kids' stash spot is.

22:54.537 --> 22:55.703
My dad knew where mine was.

22:55.772 --> 22:58.206
Right. So her mom
really knows where hers is.

22:58.275 --> 22:59.785
STEVE: All right, so we're
thinking Kiana,

22:59.809 --> 23:02.277
she actually finds the gun
and then, fresh off a beating

23:02.345 --> 23:03.544
from this monster,
she uses it

23:03.613 --> 23:04.646
and kills the guy.

23:04.714 --> 23:05.958
JUNIOR: So chances
are, when we do

23:05.982 --> 23:08.082
get the match back from
the female blood and tissue

23:08.151 --> 23:10.563
from our vic's fingernails, it's
not gonna come back to Bonnie,

23:10.587 --> 23:12.854
it'll be her mom.
- We need to find this woman, now.

23:30.941 --> 23:34.075
We searched Maleko's place.
No gun.

23:35.512 --> 23:40.448
Look, um... Detective,
I-I saw him with the gun.

23:40.517 --> 23:42.116
My boyfriend
called it a .38.

23:42.185 --> 23:43.696
I don't know what
he did with it after...

23:43.720 --> 23:44.953
We arrested him for murder.

23:45.021 --> 23:47.055
We found other evidence
in Maleko's place.

23:47.123 --> 23:48.389
Without you
coming forward,

23:48.458 --> 23:50.325
we never would have
gotten a warrant.

23:50.393 --> 23:53.328
You should feel good
about doing the right thing.

23:53.396 --> 23:54.874
Yeah, I'll let you know
when that kicks in.

23:54.898 --> 23:56.397
Tani.

23:56.466 --> 23:58.433
You're smart.

23:58.501 --> 24:01.035
So here's some advice I hope
you're smart enough to take.

24:01.104 --> 24:03.671
Use this opportunity
to get as far away

24:03.740 --> 24:05.173
from these people as you can.

24:05.241 --> 24:07.508
It's actually not about me,
it's about my brother.

24:07.577 --> 24:09.177
Well, I'd make it
about both of you.

24:09.245 --> 24:12.513
Maybe you know this, maybe
you don't, but Damien's crew

24:12.582 --> 24:16.317
is making a power grab to take
down a set of local dealers.

24:16.386 --> 24:17.906
It's only gonna
get bloodier from here.

24:21.057 --> 24:22.190
Kiana Pearsen's cell records

24:22.258 --> 24:24.092
indicate she placed
one call this morning,

24:24.160 --> 24:28.463
25 minutes before
Michael Carrigan's T.O.D.,

24:28.531 --> 24:29.797
and look who it's to.

24:29.866 --> 24:31.199
DANNY:
The ex-husband.

24:31.267 --> 24:33.301
Okay, that's very interesting,
because Bonnie said

24:33.370 --> 24:34.993
that her folks only spoke
through lawyers.

24:35.017 --> 24:35.938
TANI: Yeah, well,

24:35.939 --> 24:38.284
they hadn't spoken, at least not
by cell phone, in over a year,

24:38.308 --> 24:39.819
up until this phone call
that clocked in

24:39.843 --> 24:41.123
just over two
and a half minutes.

24:41.177 --> 24:43.444
Okay, so what are we thinking?
This is her calling him

24:43.513 --> 24:46.347
and telling him that Carrigan's
been knocking her around?

24:46.416 --> 24:47.715
JERRY:
Certainly appears so.

24:47.751 --> 24:51.386
Because mere moments
after Carrigan was killed,

24:51.454 --> 24:53.121
Owen Pearsen calls her back.

24:53.189 --> 24:55.319
Said call lasted 38 seconds.

24:55.320 --> 24:56.435
STEVE:
That's him calling her

24:56.459 --> 24:57.937
saying "I dealt with the problem."
DANNY: Well,

24:57.961 --> 24:59.271
why don't we ask him
if that's true?

24:59.295 --> 25:02.130
He's on his way here now
to talk to his daughter.

25:02.198 --> 25:03.464
(elevator chimes)

25:03.533 --> 25:04.799
Owen Pearsen.

25:04.868 --> 25:06.134
Where's my daughter?

25:06.202 --> 25:07.680
We'll get to that later.
Right now, you're under arrest

25:07.704 --> 25:09.582
for the murder of Michael Carrigan.
Turn around.

25:09.606 --> 25:10.286
What are you talking about?

25:10.310 --> 25:11.774
- No, I'm not doing...
- Put your hands behind your back.

25:11.775 --> 25:14.208
- What are you talking about?
- Give me that hand.

25:14.277 --> 25:16.210
Come on, man,
it's not what you think.

25:16.279 --> 25:18.746
Yep. Never is.

25:18.815 --> 25:19.914
(zip tie tightens)

25:19.983 --> 25:21.082
Let's go.

25:26.856 --> 25:29.687
Mr. Pearsen, the .38 was exactly
where you said it would be.

25:29.787 --> 25:31.831
<i>Our techs confirmed that it was</i>
<i>in fact the murder weapon,</i>

25:31.855 --> 25:35.524
so why don't you, uh, why don't
you tell us what happened?

25:35.592 --> 25:36.832
DANNY: Oh, we got,
we got ideas,

25:36.894 --> 25:39.661
but we'd like to hear it
from you, if that's okay.

25:39.730 --> 25:40.829
Uh...

25:41.932 --> 25:43.799
I guess it-it started with a...

25:43.867 --> 25:47.502
a phone call from my ex-wife.

25:47.571 --> 25:50.172
She was scared, you know?

25:50.240 --> 25:52.841
Um... Now, I-I don't know

25:52.910 --> 25:54.643
if either of you
guys are married,

25:54.712 --> 25:56.878
but even when
it goes south,

25:56.947 --> 25:59.047
you can't shut off some of those
feelings, you know?

25:59.116 --> 26:01.450
The-the ones that go
right into the core.

26:01.518 --> 26:03.530
And what, you go over to the
ex-wife's house, you tell her

26:03.554 --> 26:05.754
you're gonna take care
of the problem, right?

26:05.823 --> 26:08.757
Kiana guides you to the gun
that she found in Bonnie's room,

26:08.859 --> 26:10.092
or how does that work?

26:10.160 --> 26:13.061
No, no, no, that's not
what happened at all.

26:13.130 --> 26:15.564
No, no-- Kiana had no
idea about any gun.

26:15.632 --> 26:17.332
Neither of us did.

26:17.401 --> 26:22.838
Um, I-I guess that-that Bonnie,
you know, got ahold of it

26:22.906 --> 26:25.273
and then, and then
hid it in her room.

26:25.342 --> 26:27.175
It was that scumbag
Carrigan who found it

26:27.244 --> 26:29.122
when he raided her room looking
for her allowance money.

26:29.146 --> 26:31.113
Wait a minute, this guy was,
this guy was stealing

26:31.181 --> 26:33.115
his girlfriend's kid's money?

26:33.183 --> 26:35.417
This is the guy we're
talking about, yeah, yeah.

26:35.486 --> 26:38.373
I mean, apparently,
he comes home,

26:38.374 --> 26:40.942
uh, looking for drinking money,
you know?

26:41.010 --> 26:44.278
Kiana tries to stop him from
going into Bonnie's room,

26:44.347 --> 26:46.147
he wails on her and goes
into the room anyway,

26:46.182 --> 26:49.350
and within a few minutes,
he's gone.

26:49.419 --> 26:50.659
And that's when she called you?

26:50.687 --> 26:53.755
Yeah. Yeah, I told her
I'd have a word with him.

26:53.823 --> 26:57.759
Look, I was mad as hell, man,
but I did not leave that house

26:57.827 --> 26:59.594
thinking I was
gonna kill the guy.

27:02.332 --> 27:05.099
Kiana told me where
he liked to drink.

27:05.168 --> 27:06.934
I-I figured
I'd go over there and,

27:07.003 --> 27:09.370
you know, slap him around
a little bit, you know?

27:09.439 --> 27:12.540
Like, give him a taste
of his own medicine.

27:12.609 --> 27:14.876
<i>He was, he was pretty hammered</i>
<i>when I got there.</i>

27:14.944 --> 27:18.679
<i>And next thing I know,</i>
<i>he pulls out the gun.</i>

27:18.748 --> 27:21.215
<i>And it was, it was instinct.</i>
<i>I-I knew I had</i>

27:21.284 --> 27:24.118
<i>to get it away from him</i>
<i>or I'd wind up dead.</i>

27:24.187 --> 27:27.455
<i>We fought over it for a bit,</i>
<i>and it accidentally went off.</i>

27:27.524 --> 27:28.756
(gunshot)

27:31.761 --> 27:34.362
(sighs)

27:34.430 --> 27:35.663
I just assumed
the gun was his.

27:35.732 --> 27:37.832
I had no idea Bonnie
was even involved

27:37.901 --> 27:40.334
until you guys showed up
at her school.

27:40.403 --> 27:41.781
STEVE: So then, what,
you call your ex-wife then

27:41.805 --> 27:43.671
and tell her what had happened.

27:43.740 --> 27:46.007
And then she runs,
is that right?

27:46.075 --> 27:48.576
She never would have run if she
had known Bonnie was involved.

27:48.645 --> 27:50.845
Despite
Kiana's issues,

27:50.914 --> 27:53.347
she loves our daughter
unconditionally, for sure.

27:53.416 --> 27:54.849
DANNY:
You know where she is?

27:54.918 --> 27:56.217
- Right now? Any idea?
- No.

27:56.286 --> 27:58.586
But I can give you the name
of a few of her friends.

27:58.655 --> 28:00.388
I doubt she'd go very far.

28:04.794 --> 28:06.994
We need to speak with Kiana.

28:11.568 --> 28:14.468
Kiana Pearsen,
we're with Five-O.

28:15.738 --> 28:17.672
TANI: We spoke with
your ex-husband.

28:17.740 --> 28:20.508
I'm sure you know
why we're here.

28:20.577 --> 28:22.254
- Mm-hmm.
- We're gonna need to get a statement.

28:22.278 --> 28:24.378
Do you think that would be okay?

28:27.350 --> 28:28.683
(sniffles)

28:32.255 --> 28:34.355
Kiana...

28:34.424 --> 28:36.958
once we get
something down,

28:37.026 --> 28:41.662
if you'd like, I can introduce
you to someone who can help.

28:42.765 --> 28:44.265
(crying)

28:46.302 --> 28:47.401
Okay.

29:01.751 --> 29:03.625
<i>(elevator chimes)</i>

29:03.626 --> 29:04.823
You get a statement
from the mother?

29:04.824 --> 29:06.123
Signed, sealed, delivered.

29:06.192 --> 29:08.170
Um, so long as his story
checks out, I can't imagine

29:08.194 --> 29:10.695
a judge is gonna give Owen
Pearsen much jail time.

29:11.798 --> 29:13.397
STEVE:
Hey, Junior,

29:13.466 --> 29:14.810
reach out to HPD, have
them bring Pearsen in

29:14.834 --> 29:17.201
for booking, please.
- Yeah, I already did,

29:17.270 --> 29:18.547
but there's something else
you need to see here.

29:18.571 --> 29:22.006
The lab sent over their
ballistics report on our .38.

29:22.075 --> 29:23.341
TANI:
Please tell me it matches

29:23.409 --> 29:24.709
the slug from the murder scene.

29:24.777 --> 29:27.378
Oh, it's a match for our scene,
along with 14 others.

29:27.447 --> 29:29.613
Wait a minute,
you're saying this one gun

29:29.682 --> 29:31.615
is linked to 14 crimes?

29:31.684 --> 29:33.762
JUNIOR: Mm-hmm. And these are just
the ones we know about.

29:33.786 --> 29:35.753
It's called a community gun,

29:35.822 --> 29:37.455
and the reason
they're so valuable

29:37.523 --> 29:38.889
is because they
get passed around

29:38.958 --> 29:40.524
so much that the cops have

29:40.593 --> 29:42.126
almost no way
of knowing

29:42.195 --> 29:44.708
who was in possession of the damn
thing when a crime is committed.

29:44.709 --> 29:45.463
STEVE: HPD ran

29:45.531 --> 29:47.865
the ballistics and they all
lined up with the same gun.

29:47.934 --> 29:50.401
Some of these cases
are over 40 years old.

29:50.470 --> 29:52.603
46, actually.
A lot of them are still open.

29:54.006 --> 29:54.939
Including one of mine.

29:55.007 --> 29:57.742
Pull up the one on the right.

29:57.810 --> 29:59.321
STEVE: Is that the convenience store
on Colburn?

29:59.345 --> 30:01.490
When I flew in here, the first
night I got here, I went to get

30:01.514 --> 30:02.794
a bite to eat,
and the shop owner

30:02.849 --> 30:05.082
was-was shot with this gun,
apparently.

30:05.151 --> 30:07.591
On your first night in Hawaii,
you were involved in a robbery?

30:07.653 --> 30:09.420
I'm a lucky guy,
what can I say?

30:09.489 --> 30:12.390
Wow. Kind of getting
the shivers.

30:12.458 --> 30:13.557
That's eerie.

30:13.626 --> 30:15.960
Like, quantum-level
interconnected eerie.

30:16.028 --> 30:17.539
- Did the store owner make it?
DANNY: No.

30:17.563 --> 30:19.397
He died on the way
to the hospital.

30:19.465 --> 30:21.966
Uh, I worked the case for a
long time, came up with nothing.

30:22.034 --> 30:24.135
The trace on the gun,
empty, nothing.

30:24.170 --> 30:26.504
I think I may be
able to help you.

30:26.572 --> 30:28.272
The guy who had
this gun

30:28.341 --> 30:30.574
in 2015 is in Halawa.

30:30.643 --> 30:32.443
I know that because
I put him there.

30:32.512 --> 30:33.944
I think we can trace

30:34.013 --> 30:36.914
the chain of ownership and
find out who owned it in 2010.

30:36.983 --> 30:38.315
JERRY:
Okay,

30:38.384 --> 30:41.619
tell me you're not at least
a little freaked out now?

30:41.687 --> 30:43.031
These aren't
just 14 random crimes.

30:43.055 --> 30:44.455
We're linked to two of them.

30:44.524 --> 30:46.657
Three.

30:46.726 --> 30:48.726
Jerry, do me a favor,
pull this one up.

30:54.100 --> 30:57.101
(echoes):
My father worked on this case.

30:58.871 --> 31:00.638
Heard you have
a boy of your own.

31:00.706 --> 31:03.007
Steve, right?

31:04.110 --> 31:05.709
That's right.

31:05.778 --> 31:08.145
Well, he comes from hardy stock.

31:08.214 --> 31:11.382
I'm sure he'll,
he'll find his way.

31:11.451 --> 31:13.284
Wait, wait.

31:13.352 --> 31:15.820
I came out here on good faith.

31:15.888 --> 31:18.656
We had an understanding you were
to send this young man home.

31:18.724 --> 31:20.791
Understanding?

31:20.860 --> 31:23.828
We could never have
an understanding, John.

31:23.896 --> 31:26.063
You've done too much harm.

31:26.132 --> 31:30.134
Spread too much pain
with how stubborn you are.

31:30.203 --> 31:32.169
You never let
anything go, just like,

31:32.238 --> 31:33.437
like during my trial.

31:33.506 --> 31:35.339
When everything
was about to break my way.

31:35.408 --> 31:37.675
You! You and you alone.

31:37.743 --> 31:39.810
You couldn't let it go.

31:39.879 --> 31:41.612
You just, you dug and
you dug and you dug

31:41.681 --> 31:43.681
until you found something
that told those people

31:43.749 --> 31:45.583
what they needed to hear.

31:45.651 --> 31:48.819
So I took a page
out of your book.

31:49.922 --> 31:52.089
I didn't give up.

31:52.158 --> 31:54.892
And now, I'm the dog
with the bone

31:54.961 --> 31:56.360
and here we are.

31:56.429 --> 31:58.863
We are indeed.

31:58.931 --> 32:00.598
But you leave him out of it.

32:00.666 --> 32:02.386
You have a score you want
to settle, Hester?

32:04.403 --> 32:05.569
Settle it with me.

32:15.047 --> 32:16.714
If you insist.

32:16.782 --> 32:18.482
(grunting)
No!

32:18.551 --> 32:20.618
(grunting)

32:20.686 --> 32:22.219
(groaning)

32:24.790 --> 32:26.223
(coughing)

32:28.194 --> 32:31.061
(groaning)

32:32.198 --> 32:34.598
(panting)
(groaning)

32:35.735 --> 32:38.202
(groans)

32:38.271 --> 32:39.770
(groaning continues)

32:39.839 --> 32:42.039
Go-- he's getting away.

32:42.108 --> 32:44.308
Settle down, man. You got shot.

32:44.377 --> 32:46.644
I'm gonna try
to stop the bleeding.

32:48.915 --> 32:50.581
Hey.
(groans)

32:50.616 --> 32:52.316
What's your name, man?

32:52.385 --> 32:53.984
Duke.

32:54.053 --> 32:55.697
Listen, Duke,
I'm not gonna lie to you, man.

32:55.721 --> 32:56.887
You're in bad shape.

32:56.956 --> 32:58.267
All right? But you got
a fighting chance

32:58.291 --> 32:59.568
if we get out of here right now.

32:59.592 --> 33:01.659
And I'm a fighter.
Okay?

33:01.727 --> 33:03.861
Are you? Huh?

33:03.930 --> 33:05.863
- Huh?
- All right.

33:05.932 --> 33:07.498
(groans)
LUKELA: <i>It's been 36 years</i>

33:07.567 --> 33:09.199
<i>since I talked</i>
<i>about that night.</i>

33:09.268 --> 33:12.169
Your father and I...

33:12.238 --> 33:14.338
certainly never discussed it.

33:15.408 --> 33:17.575
He saved my life.

33:19.645 --> 33:22.379
Despite that,
it still felt like a defeat.

33:22.448 --> 33:24.782
(exhales) I'm sorry
about your partner.

33:26.285 --> 33:28.786
Thank you, Steve.

33:28.854 --> 33:30.821
He was a good cop.

33:32.825 --> 33:35.225
I remember that night.

33:35.294 --> 33:37.494
I was six years old.

33:37.563 --> 33:39.330
There was something
about that phone call.

33:41.667 --> 33:42.967
The look
on my father's face when

33:43.035 --> 33:45.469
he left the house that night,
what he said to me...

33:47.206 --> 33:49.773
I just knew something was wrong.

33:49.842 --> 33:51.542
JOHN:
<i>Listen, Steve, um...</i>

33:53.312 --> 33:55.946
Last night I had to leave
because someone was in trouble.

33:56.015 --> 33:58.282
That's what I do.

33:58.351 --> 34:00.317
And the truth is...

34:03.089 --> 34:05.022
...there's a lot
of bad people out there.

34:05.091 --> 34:08.559
And sometimes
decent folks get hurt.

34:08.628 --> 34:12.161
My job's to try
to stop that from happening.

34:12.231 --> 34:15.833
That night, that was
the first time I, uh,

34:15.900 --> 34:18.835
I really understood...

34:18.904 --> 34:21.605
what my old man did every day.

34:23.175 --> 34:25.442
What he risked.

34:26.911 --> 34:28.879
I understood, at that point...

34:28.947 --> 34:31.849
that there was something more
important than himself.

34:34.920 --> 34:36.152
Hmm.

34:36.222 --> 34:38.856
(chuckles)
What's that they say

34:38.924 --> 34:40.257
about the apple? Hmm?

34:40.326 --> 34:42.326
Falling from the tree?

34:42.395 --> 34:43.460
(chuckles)
Hmm?

34:46.264 --> 34:48.465
Did you guys ever get a lead?

34:48.534 --> 34:50.000
No.

34:50.069 --> 34:51.534
Not that we stopped looking.

34:51.603 --> 34:54.705
I still keep a copy
of the file on my desk.

34:54.774 --> 34:57.007
I look at it
from time to time but...

34:57.076 --> 34:58.842
it's always...

34:58.911 --> 35:00.678
just dead ends.

35:04.083 --> 35:06.750
Duke... we got the gun,
which means...

35:06.819 --> 35:08.585
we have the serial number.

35:09.889 --> 35:12.222
I mean, it's possible,
after all these years,

35:12.258 --> 35:14.024
you could actually get your man.

35:24.701 --> 35:26.811
Okay. We're five minutes out.

35:26.934 --> 35:28.567
Thank you.

35:28.636 --> 35:30.169
All right,
Halawa's gonna put

35:30.237 --> 35:31.470
Maleko in the box
for us.

35:33.474 --> 35:35.174
You okay?

35:35.242 --> 35:37.443
Yeah, I'm good.

35:37.511 --> 35:40.145
You seem good.
You seem very chipper.

35:43.517 --> 35:44.917
I know it's crazy, but a...

35:44.985 --> 35:46.585
small part of me just still

35:46.654 --> 35:49.054
feels like a snitch, you know?

35:49.123 --> 35:50.556
Like I sold out
my people.

35:50.624 --> 35:52.024
Okay, that's, that's ridiculous.

35:52.092 --> 35:54.326
They were not your people
to begin with, okay?

35:54.361 --> 35:55.939
And y-you probably saved
your brother's life

35:55.963 --> 35:57.162
by pulling him out of there.

35:59.166 --> 36:01.166
I assume this guy,
he has no idea

36:01.235 --> 36:03.035
that you're the one
who put him in jail?

36:03.103 --> 36:05.237
No. No, he doesn't.

36:05.306 --> 36:07.473
A couple days later,
I broke up with Damien.

36:07.541 --> 36:09.541
He had this
wandering eye,

36:09.610 --> 36:12.644
so that gave me the cover
I needed to break it off clean.

36:12.713 --> 36:14.480
Although, it wasn't
exactly clean,

36:14.548 --> 36:16.982
'cause I trashed
his place, like,

36:17.051 --> 36:19.651
really good before I left.

36:19.720 --> 36:20.886
And then as far as

36:20.955 --> 36:22.654
Maleko's arrest...

36:22.723 --> 36:24.323
I don't think anyone
had any idea.

36:24.391 --> 36:27.259
And then six months later,
I joined the Academy.

36:27.328 --> 36:28.727
And here we are.

36:28.829 --> 36:31.396
- Here we are.
- It's very, uh, it's weird.

36:31.465 --> 36:33.665
What do you mean?
Why is it weird?

36:33.734 --> 36:36.301
The gun that
had you join the HPD

36:36.370 --> 36:38.270
is the same gun
that almost got me killed

36:38.339 --> 36:40.305
when I first arrived here,
you know? Little weird.

36:40.374 --> 36:42.174
Yeah, you're right.
That is weird.

36:42.243 --> 36:44.243
Right?
(phone rings)

36:44.311 --> 36:45.677
What's up, Steve?

36:45.746 --> 36:47.157
STEVE:
<i>Hey, Danny, you got me and Duke</i>

36:47.181 --> 36:48.247
<i>on, uh, on speaker here.</i>

36:48.315 --> 36:50.215
- You guys at the prison yet?
-No.

36:50.284 --> 36:51.862
We're, like, five minutes out.
What's up with the .38?

36:51.886 --> 36:53.819
- You find the original owner yet?
- Yes.

36:53.888 --> 36:55.632
Check this out. That gun
was originally registered

36:55.656 --> 36:57.489
in 1971. The woman
is still alive

36:57.558 --> 36:59.625
and well on the North Shore.

36:59.693 --> 37:01.238
TANI: Did she know Hester?
- No, not personally.

37:01.262 --> 37:03.695
But she did sell the gun
to him in 1972.

37:03.764 --> 37:05.697
Still had the original
sales slip.

37:05.766 --> 37:06.832
Got to love a hoarder.

37:06.901 --> 37:08.534
LUKELA:
Hester had an alias.

37:08.602 --> 37:10.480
One that HPD didn't know about,
so it's not in the file.

37:10.504 --> 37:13.438
Turns out that that alias
has popped up a few times since.

37:13.507 --> 37:15.218
Most recently two years ago
on a lease agreement

37:15.242 --> 37:16.475
in California.

37:16.544 --> 37:19.211
So I guess that means
you're going to California.

37:19.280 --> 37:20.657
Yeah, we're on the way
to the airstrip now.

37:20.681 --> 37:22.481
Okay. Happy hunting.

37:22.550 --> 37:23.582
Thanks, pal. You, too.

37:28.389 --> 37:31.490
Your hair got long.
What can I say?

37:31.559 --> 37:33.025
Time marches on.

37:33.093 --> 37:34.660
A shame about Damien.

37:34.728 --> 37:35.839
Yeah, we all make
choices, don't we?

37:35.863 --> 37:36.863
I thought you got booted

37:36.931 --> 37:38.196
out of the Academy.

37:38.265 --> 37:39.543
DANNY:
Yeah, that's old news, too.

37:39.567 --> 37:41.199
I'd actually like to
get past all that.

37:41.268 --> 37:42.679
Could we, could we
talk about your gun?

37:42.703 --> 37:45.337
What, that? That's not my gun.

37:45.406 --> 37:47.406
Oh. Uh, not-not now,

37:47.474 --> 37:48.740
obviously,
but it was

37:48.809 --> 37:49.741
in 2015.

37:49.810 --> 37:51.810
No, never seen it before.
Sorry.

37:51.879 --> 37:54.513
All right, Maleko,
here's the thing. (sighs)

37:54.582 --> 37:56.014
So this very gun

37:56.083 --> 37:58.584
was used in a homicide
this morning.

37:58.652 --> 38:00.652
What, you think I did it?

38:00.721 --> 38:02.054
DANNY:
Mm-mm. No, knowing

38:02.122 --> 38:04.556
your alibi, it's gonna
probably check out.

38:04.625 --> 38:07.359
Anyway, she's gonna ask you
a question. If you answer it,

38:07.428 --> 38:08.527
I will make
a phone call

38:08.596 --> 38:09.995
and, uh,

38:10.064 --> 38:12.497
I promise you your stay
here will get better

38:12.566 --> 38:14.266
if I make that
phone call.

38:14.335 --> 38:17.536
Why don't you take us
down memory lane?

38:17.605 --> 38:19.838
Where'd you get that gun?

38:19.907 --> 38:21.974
Hmm?

38:28.148 --> 38:29.214
DANNY:
How you doing, man?

38:29.283 --> 38:31.316
Oh, welcome.
You're early.

38:31.385 --> 38:32.785
The service doesn't start
till 6:00.

38:32.820 --> 38:34.064
We're actually not here
for the service.

38:34.088 --> 38:35.365
Uh, I'm Detective
Danny Williams.

38:35.389 --> 38:36.421
This is my partner,

38:36.490 --> 38:37.756
Tani Rey.

38:37.825 --> 38:39.358
How can I help you?

38:39.426 --> 38:41.526
You don't, you don't
recognize me, huh?

38:41.595 --> 38:43.006
Yeah, I-I don't really
recognize you, either,

38:43.030 --> 38:45.041
'cause last time I saw you,
you were wearing a ski mask.

38:45.065 --> 38:48.533
But I do recognize
that tattoo on your wrist.

38:48.602 --> 38:50.736
You, uh,
your remember this?

38:50.804 --> 38:52.515
The guy who bought it from you
sold you out.

38:52.539 --> 38:54.539
So turn around and put your hands
behind your back.

38:57.444 --> 38:58.977
I did unforgiveable things.

38:59.046 --> 39:01.213
But that night changed me.

39:01.281 --> 39:04.549
You know, two months later
I found, I found God.

39:04.618 --> 39:07.285
Uh, I started sweeping
the floors at this place.

39:07.354 --> 39:10.489
Worked my way up to head usher.

39:10.557 --> 39:11.757
Good for you.
Good for you.

39:11.825 --> 39:13.069
You know, there's an active
community of worship

39:13.093 --> 39:14.137
in Halawa, you're gonna
fit right in.

39:14.161 --> 39:15.794
Come on.

39:28.776 --> 39:30.842
All right, this is it, Duke, you ready?
Ready.

39:30.911 --> 39:32.577
Let's go.

39:49.663 --> 39:50.762
When I move,

39:50.831 --> 39:52.531
you take the rear.

40:04.611 --> 40:05.911
(clattering nearby)

40:08.916 --> 40:10.282
(gunshots)

40:10.350 --> 40:12.017
(groans)

40:13.887 --> 40:15.921
(groaning)

40:22.930 --> 40:24.329
(panting)

40:36.443 --> 40:39.544
Duke! Yo, Duke.

40:49.757 --> 40:52.023
Scott Hester.

40:52.092 --> 40:55.594
This is John McGarrett's son.

40:55.662 --> 40:57.162
And my name

40:57.231 --> 40:59.598
is Duke Lukela.

41:01.602 --> 41:04.269
