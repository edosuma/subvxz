for my mom, but my mom wasn't home.

to one day take a vacation together.

I thought of it in the hospital.

11:33.032 --> 11:36.786
You know, you didn't have to take me
to the emergency room like that,

11:36.870 --> 11:37.871
but you did.

11:39.080 --> 11:41.166
You would've done the same
if it was me.

11:41.249 --> 11:43.501
No.
I'd let you die in the street.

11:43.585 --> 11:46.713
And then I'd move your body so it looked
like you were blowing yourself.

11:46.796 --> 11:50.592
And then I'd sell tickets to anybody who
wanted to see a dead kid blowing himself.

11:51.217 --> 11:54.929
You and me are okay now, Murphy.
Just don't piss me off again.

11:55.013 --> 11:57.932
Or some weirdo's gonna be
jerking off to your corpse.

11:58.016 --> 11:59.976
I won't, I swear.

12:00.059 --> 12:02.103
Thanks, Jimmy.
I'll see you around.

12:03.021 --> 12:03.855
Who's that?

12:03.938 --> 12:06.399
That's the dickweed
who took me to the doctor.

12:07.763 --> 12:11.153
[music]

12:11.154 --> 12:15.533
- Thanks for saving my brother.
- [stutters] You're welcome.

12:19.037 --> 12:21.247
- What are you smiling at?!
- Nothing!

12:21.331 --> 12:23.416
Get away from the window, Bridget!

12:23.500 --> 12:26.986
Blow it out your ass,
you fucking splooge socket!

12:29.702 --> 12:31.591
[grunts, thud, groans]

12:31.674 --> 12:36.888
Your lettuce doesn't have
to "romaine" soggy anymore.

12:36.971 --> 12:41.142
[chuckles] You can "leaf" the drying
to the Salad Tosser.

12:41.226 --> 12:43.937
[cheering and applause]

12:44.020 --> 12:46.147
- [woman] I love you!
- We did it!

12:46.231 --> 12:47.232
You did it!

12:47.315 --> 12:51.361
<i>[crowd chanting] Henrietta!
Henrietta!</i>

12:51.444 --> 12:55.824
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.

12:55.907 --> 13:00.328
Tell us, Henrietta, how did you come up
with this brilliant invention of yours?

13:00.411 --> 13:05.291
Well, it's an amazing story.
I can't take credit for it.

13:05.375 --> 13:08.211
Chin up, tits out, Sue.
It's your time to shine!

13:08.294 --> 13:12.298
God gave me the idea when my
washing machine broke down!

13:12.382 --> 13:13.758
[gasps]

13:13.842 --> 13:15.051
That resonates!

13:15.134 --> 13:19.514
<i>You should have seen the first
prototype I built in my garage.</i>

13:19.597 --> 13:23.351
- Oh, my God. She's stealing it.
- Not necessarily.

13:23.434 --> 13:26.104
My husband, Frank,
wanted to put it through a wall!

13:26.187 --> 13:28.606
Oh, yeah. She's stealing it.

13:28.690 --> 13:31.109
<i>[woman] The Salad Tosser,
I always liked it!</i>

13:31.192 --> 13:32.610
<i>That's it for this year, folks!</i>

13:32.694 --> 13:36.155
Put your party pantsuits on, girls!
We did it!

13:36.239 --> 13:38.408
- How could you?
- How could I what?

13:38.491 --> 13:41.578
You took credit for my idea.

13:41.661 --> 13:45.748
Oh, dear sweet Sue.
Let me ask you something.

13:45.832 --> 13:48.501
Who was Christopher Columbus' navigator?

13:48.585 --> 13:52.422
Can you name one fucking fiddle player
in Beethoven's band?

13:52.505 --> 13:55.967
You know how many Irishmen
and test monkeys died at Kitty Hawk

13:56.050 --> 14:00.054
before those two derby-wearing dickheads
had the balls to get on that thing?

14:00.138 --> 14:02.515
Every moment in history needs a name.

14:02.599 --> 14:05.059
And I'm that name.

14:05.143 --> 14:07.395
So, wipe that kicked,
puppy dog look off your face.

14:07.478 --> 14:10.106
The Salad Tosser is mine now.

14:10.189 --> 14:13.192
- You won't get away with this.
- We will take you to court.

14:13.276 --> 14:14.986
Of course you won't.

14:15.069 --> 14:18.114
You invented it while you
were working for Plast-A-Ware,

14:18.197 --> 14:21.576
so Plast-A-Ware owns the idea.

14:21.659 --> 14:27.081
And I am Plast-A-Ware.
Here, celebrate our success.

14:27.165 --> 14:29.897
But not too much. I need
you to come in tomorrow

14:29.898 --> 14:32.629
with five new ideas and
we'll see what sticks.

14:32.712 --> 14:35.006
[cheering and applause]
[Henrietta laughs]

14:35.089 --> 14:36.699
Oh, my God.

14:41.221 --> 14:44.682
- [man] Come on, hurry up.
- Have fun in Duluth, Scoop.

14:44.766 --> 14:47.518
Don't forget your Me-Paper,
you racist fuck.

14:51.439 --> 14:55.109
Now all we have to do
is wait for Dunbarton to realize

14:55.193 --> 14:58.696
he's got no one to run baggage
on the busiest day of the month.

14:58.780 --> 15:00.448
Except for Frank Murphy,

15:00.531 --> 15:03.868
who will just happen to be here,
filling the rubber machine.

15:03.952 --> 15:06.663
And we'll tell Dunbarton
you're the only man

15:06.746 --> 15:08.665
who can pull this airline
out of the shitter.

15:08.748 --> 15:11.542
And I will back you up all the way.

15:11.626 --> 15:15.213
Thanks, Bob.
I know you're taking a big risk for me.

15:15.296 --> 15:17.674
It's way overdue, Frank.

15:17.757 --> 15:22.804
I should've stuck up for you when that
miserable prick fired you on Christmas,

15:22.887 --> 15:25.223
because that's what friends do.

15:26.140 --> 15:29.769
They stick by each other,
through thick and thin.

15:30.853 --> 15:32.146
No matter what.

15:33.773 --> 15:35.400
There's our hero.

15:36.609 --> 15:37.694
[blows kiss]

15:38.444 --> 15:39.404
Love you, Frank.

15:39.487 --> 15:41.281
Packed you a lunch, working man.

15:41.364 --> 15:42.949
Honey, I'm proud of you!

15:43.032 --> 15:46.703
We're a team, Frank.
And I need you now more than ever.

15:46.786 --> 15:49.414
You're the only person I can turn to and...

15:49.497 --> 15:51.249
[snoring]

15:51.332 --> 15:52.625
When have I ever disappointed you?

15:52.709 --> 15:54.711
Just a quick loan, honey.

15:54.794 --> 15:57.588
You can do whatever your heart desires
as long as you're home by 3:00.

15:57.672 --> 15:59.173
I'm getting a hernia supporting you.

15:59.257 --> 16:01.134
The old... [nagging sound]

16:01.217 --> 16:03.177
Blah, blah, blah!

16:03.261 --> 16:05.179
Frank, wait.

16:05.263 --> 16:09.934
Before we leave like this, is there
anything you want to say to me?

16:10.018 --> 16:11.894
Anything at all?

16:11.978 --> 16:15.919
[Pogo] That's the kind of friend I want
to be from now on, Frank.

16:16.019 --> 16:20.919
- What do you say?
- You miserable fucking asshole.

16:21.738 --> 16:23.031
Thanks a lot, fucker!

16:23.114 --> 16:27.368
- I pour my heart out to you and this is...
- No, Bob, not you! Me!

16:27.452 --> 16:29.787
Guys, I'm sorry.
I got to go see Sue.

16:29.871 --> 16:31.331
I can't do this thing with you.

16:31.414 --> 16:34.709
Can't do this?
You just did do this!

16:34.792 --> 16:36.565
Motherfucker, we just
drugged a vegetable

16:36.566 --> 16:38.338
and stuffed him in
the bottom of a plane!

16:38.421 --> 16:39.589
I know, and I'm sorry.

16:39.672 --> 16:43.092
We can't make this go away!
It's a Class-A felony.

16:43.176 --> 16:45.845
- Not in Texas.
- Hey! What y'all doing here?

16:45.928 --> 16:48.139
- Airport stuff.
- Nothing. Nothing.

16:48.222 --> 16:49.807
We were just leaving.
It's okay.

16:49.891 --> 16:53.770
No, it's not okay.
You're messing with our hijacking!

16:53.771 --> 16:56.343
[action music]
[gunshots]

16:56.378 --> 16:59.150
<i>[hijacker] Everybody put
your motherfucking hands up!</i>

16:59.233 --> 17:01.444
No, no. No, no, no, no!
You can't do this today!

17:01.527 --> 17:03.321
They're not supposed to do it
any day.

17:03.404 --> 17:07.861
If anyone asks, a Puerto Rican
put Scoop on that plane.

17:09.827 --> 17:12.329
[slurring] How did we not see that coming?

17:12.413 --> 17:14.040
We were so blind!

17:16.166 --> 17:17.335
Fucking lettuce!

17:17.417 --> 17:18.711
[grunts]

17:18.795 --> 17:20.463
Get out of the street, lady!

17:20.546 --> 17:23.549
You get out of the street, lady!

17:26.719 --> 17:30.264
That's it, Sue.
Get all those feelings out now.

17:30.348 --> 17:34.477
That way it'll be easier for you
to go back to work tomorrow.

17:34.560 --> 17:36.270
I can't go back there.

17:36.354 --> 17:38.314
That would be humiliating.

17:38.398 --> 17:41.442
Day after day,
knowing what they did to me,

17:41.526 --> 17:44.320
everybody looking at me
like I have a fatal disease.

17:44.404 --> 17:46.072
"Oh, poor Sue.

17:46.155 --> 17:48.574
They stole your idea.

17:48.658 --> 17:53.162
Now go get us some fucking ham sandwiches,
hold the mustard."

17:54.997 --> 17:58.376
Well, would your husband dying
make things better?

17:58.459 --> 18:01.879

week is taking place in our own backyard.</i>

hostages and surrender now!

18:16.477 --> 18:20.398
Fuck you! No way!
We demand $10 million

to help out my forgotten
brothers and sisters in Detroit!

18:23.943 --> 18:27.330
- And Oakland!
- Sorry, man. We got to cut bait on Oakland.

18:27.365 --> 18:30.700
[whimpers]
We do not negotiate with terrorists!

18:30.701 --> 18:33.801
[guns cock]

18:34.287 --> 18:38.374

to your fucking house on Sunday.

18:38.458 --> 18:41.419
[phone ringing]

18:41.502 --> 18:43.243
Hello?
Hey, Mom.

18:43.278 --> 18:45.590
- How'd your thing go?
- Are we millionaires now?

18:45.673 --> 18:47.300
[slurring] Your father's in danger.

18:47.383 --> 18:52.221
I need you to find somebody to drive you
to the TV store and pick me up.

18:52.305 --> 18:54.932
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, honey!

18:57.977 --> 19:00.938
My mom's drunk
and I need a ride to go get her!

19:01.022 --> 19:02.356
Take my horse, partner.

19:04.567 --> 19:07.195
- All four hundred of them.
- Seriously?

19:07.278 --> 19:09.655
I'd drive you myself,
but giving up a gram a day

19:09.656 --> 19:12.033
of cocaine habit isn't
as easy as it sounded

19:12.116 --> 19:14.243
when I was on cocaine.

19:14.327 --> 19:16.162
[moaning]

19:17.288 --> 19:21.375
We have a bomb in this suitcase,
and we will use it!

19:21.459 --> 19:23.586
I'm the CEO of the airline.

19:23.669 --> 19:25.922
Let me talk some sense to these people.

19:26.547 --> 19:29.967
What are you fucking
animals doing on my airplane?

19:30.051 --> 19:32.470
- Mr. Dunbarton, no!
- Murphy?!

19:32.553 --> 19:36.724
What the hell are you doing here,
you shamrock-shitting pen-hoarder?

19:36.807 --> 19:40.269
- Fucking up my life, sir!
- This is your last chance.

19:40.353 --> 19:43.731
You've got ten seconds to give up
or we're storming the plane.

19:43.814 --> 19:47.948
Then you've got seven seconds before
I blow this whole place the fuck up!

19:48.444 --> 19:50.279
Well, then we'll do it in five.

19:50.363 --> 19:52.323
This ain't Name That Tune, motherfucker!

19:52.406 --> 19:55.451
I'm gonna start shooting
hostages one at a time.

19:56.327 --> 19:59.038
Go ahead. Say your prayers.

20:00.840 --> 20:04.252
- Nah, I don't think so.
- Frank, what the fuck?

20:04.335 --> 20:07.838
Buddy, if you shot me now,
you'd be doing me a favor.

20:07.922 --> 20:10.883
- My wife hates me... for good reason.
- [crowd gasps]

20:10.967 --> 20:12.969
I haven't been there for her.

20:13.052 --> 20:16.180
The only right decision I ever made
was marrying that woman.

20:16.264 --> 20:18.516
And I spent the last two months
throwing it all away.

20:18.599 --> 20:22.061
- Oh, Frank...
- Who the fuck is this guy?

20:22.144 --> 20:25.398
This morning she gave me
one last chance to fix things.

20:25.481 --> 20:27.191
I should have said I was sorry,

20:27.275 --> 20:31.320
that I think she's a great woman,
a wonderful mother,

20:31.404 --> 20:34.703
and an absolute animal in the sack.
[vomits]

20:34.740 --> 20:36.826
But I blew it.

20:36.909 --> 20:39.870
I'll tell you what.
Let all these other people go.

20:39.954 --> 20:42.206
They've actually got
something to live for.

20:42.290 --> 20:45.793
As for me?
I deserve a bullet.

20:46.711 --> 20:49.255
So, go ahead.
Just shoot me.

20:56.012 --> 20:57.680
- Frank!
- Dad!

20:57.763 --> 20:59.765
Jesus Christ!
You fucking shot me!

20:59.849 --> 21:02.727
Anybody moves,
the next one is in his head!

21:02.810 --> 21:04.228
Somebody do something!

21:04.312 --> 21:05.771
[groans]

21:05.855 --> 21:09.546
Get ready to go in. Forty percent
survival rate is acceptable.

21:09.581 --> 21:13.112
Hey! How did this plane get
in my apartment?

21:13.195 --> 21:14.655
Wha...
[grunting]

21:14.739 --> 21:17.074

- Sweet Jesus!

21:17.158 --> 21:19.243
Those butchers are already
maiming hostages!

21:19.327 --> 21:21.245
You dirty trickers!

21:21.329 --> 21:24.332
- Gave me a sleepy coffee!
- Ah, shit.

21:24.415 --> 21:26.167
Time to call my brother-in-law.

21:26.250 --> 21:29.211
No hair dryers on the tarmac!

22:58.634 --> 23:00.219
Holy shit.

23:01.303 --> 23:04.098
- Holy shit!
- Sweet Jesus! [screaming]

23:05.224 --> 23:09.228
I think Dunbarton would have wanted us
to take the rest of the day off.

23:09.311 --> 23:11.230
- Frank!
- Sue?

23:12.374 --> 23:15.278
[music]

23:15.313 --> 23:17.736
- Ah!
- Oh, my God! Are you okay?

23:17.820 --> 23:20.114
I'll be fine.
It went right through.

23:20.197 --> 23:21.449
And I did kind of ask for it.

23:21.532 --> 23:24.076
I know. I heard everything you said.

23:24.160 --> 23:27.371
Oh. Yeah, I don't think
I was making a whole lot of sense.

23:27.455 --> 23:30.833
I knew exactly what you meant.
And it was beautiful.

23:30.916 --> 23:32.084
- Daddy!
- Dad!

23:32.168 --> 23:34.420
Hey, guys!
I'm sorry you kids had to see that.

23:34.503 --> 23:36.881
Yeah, that was really fucked up.

23:36.964 --> 23:38.507
Yes, it was.

23:38.591 --> 23:40.468
And it's gonna hurt for a while.

23:40.551 --> 23:42.261
But here's how you deal with it:

23:42.344 --> 23:43.679
you just shove it down.

23:43.762 --> 23:46.223
Keep shoving till it goes away.

23:46.307 --> 23:49.393
It will try to come back up,
but just keep shoving it down.

23:49.477 --> 23:50.519
But his face was...

23:50.603 --> 23:52.229
I know, princess, just keep shoving.

23:52.313 --> 23:53.439
We'll take you for ice cream.

23:54.732 --> 23:57.067
- I love you.
- I love you too.

23:58.402 --> 24:00.362
- Gross!
- We're in love.

24:00.446 --> 24:02.490
No, Dad, you're covered in blood!

24:02.573 --> 24:04.700
Well, so were you when I first saw you.

24:11.707 --> 24:15.461
Honey, I'm so sorry
things went sour for you today.

24:15.544 --> 24:17.630
No. Shh. That's not important now.

24:17.713 --> 24:18.881
Yes, it is.

24:18.964 --> 24:20.925
That old broad didn't deserve you.

24:21.008 --> 24:23.177
Your next invention will be even better.

24:23.260 --> 24:27.556
Whatever you want to do,
I will support you one thousand percent.

24:27.640 --> 24:29.808
Thank you, sweetie.

24:30.768 --> 24:34.063
And you didn't have to go to the pawn shop
and buy this old thing back.

24:34.146 --> 24:36.273
I sure as hell did.

24:36.357 --> 24:38.025
And I'll never lose sight of it again.

24:38.108 --> 24:40.528
But it cost $250.

24:40.611 --> 24:43.322
It was worth every penny
of what I traded it for.

24:43.405 --> 24:46.992
- What the fuck?
- [Bill] What are we supposed to watch now?

24:47.076 --> 24:49.703
- [Frank] Watch each other!
- Such a dick!

24:49.787 --> 24:54.124
They'll be fine. Maybe Maureen
will teach Kevin to read.

24:54.208 --> 24:57.545
Frank, it feels like
we have a chance at a new start.

24:57.628 --> 25:00.756
The kids are getting older now and
they're not gonna need us as much anymore.

25:00.839 --> 25:02.800
You could go back to college.

25:02.883 --> 25:04.718
And you could take flight lessons.

25:04.802 --> 25:06.512
Maybe I will.

25:06.595 --> 25:08.514
Come here, beautiful.

25:11.809 --> 25:14.687
- Oh, Frank.
- Latex, my dear?

25:14.770 --> 25:17.189
[Sue] Ooh, I smell cherries.

25:17.910 --> 25:22.428
[music]

25:34.206 --> 25:36.375
One, two, three, baby!

25:36.458 --> 25:38.669
One, two, three, baby!

25:38.752 --> 25:40.504
Baby! Baby! Baby!
Baby! Baby!
