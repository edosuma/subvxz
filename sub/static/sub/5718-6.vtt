WEBVTT

00:03.904 --> 00:05.906
Anyone can go
as Frankenstein.

00:05.973 --> 00:08.876
I wanna go as the man
who dared to defy God

00:08.942 --> 00:10.911
and create Frankenstein.

00:10.978 --> 00:13.914
He's the real monster.

00:13.981 --> 00:15.849
Perfectly normal,
perfectly healthy.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.951
I don't understand.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.387
If Dave's going
trick-or-treating
with Stuart,

00:19.453 --> 00:20.821
why can't he just
stay over there?

00:20.888 --> 00:22.090
Why do I have to babysit?

00:22.156 --> 00:23.624
Dave can't stay
with Stuart.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.494
His grandfather
lives with him,
and sometimes he bites.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.828
You know what else bites?

00:27.895 --> 00:28.929
This.

00:28.996 --> 00:30.731
I'm helping Kendra
set up for her party,

00:30.798 --> 00:32.533
and then
I just have to leave?

00:32.600 --> 00:35.002
You can go back when
we come home from our party.

00:35.069 --> 00:37.571
We won't be long.
Your father tires very easily.

00:40.074 --> 00:42.876
Look, if you're gonna give us
a big, steaming bowl of 'tude,

00:42.943 --> 00:45.879
maybe I won't
let you borrow Gary.

00:45.946 --> 00:47.481
But I already
told Kendra

00:47.548 --> 00:49.250
she could use him
for decoration.

00:49.317 --> 00:51.552
The theme of the party
is ghosts and monsters,

00:51.619 --> 00:53.321
and dead people
and stuff.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.089
So the theme
is Halloween.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.926
Okay, you can borrow
Gary, but be careful.

00:58.992 --> 01:01.429
My parents gave him to me when
I graduated from med school.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.464
Dad, you know
how responsible I am.

01:03.531 --> 01:05.166
I know exactly
how responsible you are,

01:05.233 --> 01:07.201
which is why I'm worried.
(CHUCKLES)

01:07.268 --> 01:08.369
Nothing? Really?

01:10.738 --> 01:12.540
Have him back home
by midnight, all right?

01:12.606 --> 01:14.074
And don't give him
anything to drink.

01:14.142 --> 01:16.577
It literally goes
right through him.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.946
Funny as never, Dad.

01:19.012 --> 01:21.149
I'm surprised you guys
celebrate Halloween, anyway.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.351
Grandma said dad
proposed on Halloween

01:23.417 --> 01:25.953
and messed it up so bad,
he and mom almost broke up.

01:26.019 --> 01:27.188
That's not what happened.

01:27.255 --> 01:28.822
She also said that
would have been better,

01:28.889 --> 01:31.292
because then, mom
could've married
Billy Tanaka, who's rich...

01:31.359 --> 01:34.562
Okay. Thank you, Molly.
Super-constructive.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.197
Then what did happen?

01:37.365 --> 01:38.366
Okay, fine.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.633
It was 1995.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.369
Your mom and I had
been dating for a while,

01:41.435 --> 01:45.406
and I was dressed as
America's sexiest judge,
Lance Ito.

01:48.176 --> 01:51.011
I was still a med student,
and I didn't have much money.

01:51.078 --> 01:52.513
Do you have money now?

01:52.580 --> 01:55.149
'Cause I feel like
I don't have a lot of stuff.

01:55.216 --> 01:57.518
Okay, let me
finish my story.

01:57.585 --> 01:59.587
Anyway, I wanted it
to be special,

01:59.653 --> 02:03.023
so I took your mom
to Captain Spooky's
Halloween carnival.

02:03.090 --> 02:04.358
ALLISON: He knew
I've always loved Halloween,

02:04.425 --> 02:05.559
and I was dressed in a way

02:05.626 --> 02:07.495
that inspired
your dad's favorite joke.

02:07.561 --> 02:08.629
What? No costume?

02:08.696 --> 02:10.097
(BOTH LAUGH)

02:11.699 --> 02:14.302
Ken, you're the
total package.

02:14.368 --> 02:16.036
Smart, funny,

02:16.103 --> 02:19.139
and you have this
mischievous elf-like quality

02:19.207 --> 02:21.675
that I find very sexy.

02:21.742 --> 02:22.776
Ew!

02:24.178 --> 02:25.913
Anyway, I worked
up my courage

02:25.979 --> 02:27.581
and got down
on one knee.

02:29.183 --> 02:31.885
Allison, the verdict is in.

02:31.952 --> 02:34.522
We're really
good together.
You are so right.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.089
Hey, we should
get married.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.258
Why are you kneeling?

02:37.325 --> 02:38.459
I was about to propose.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.093
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.362
Go ahead.

02:41.429 --> 02:43.063
It's too late.
You ruined it.

02:43.130 --> 02:44.164
I didn't ruin it.

02:44.232 --> 02:45.266
Shya!

02:45.333 --> 02:46.800
I've been planning
this for weeks,

02:46.867 --> 02:49.002
and you spoiled it with
one careless mouth fart.

02:49.870 --> 02:50.938
"Mouth fart"?

02:51.004 --> 02:52.606
I apologized, you jerk.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.042
Oh, I'm the jerk?
When you ruined everything?

02:55.108 --> 02:57.745
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa.
Are you proposing?

02:57.811 --> 02:58.812
I was trying to.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.147
Hey!

03:00.214 --> 03:02.683
How about a picture
for old Captain Spooky?

03:02.750 --> 03:04.285
Arr, arr!

03:06.520 --> 03:08.622
They're making me
something called a website.

03:10.424 --> 03:11.825
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

03:14.995 --> 03:17.365
Oh, my God.
That sounds so awkward,

03:17.431 --> 03:19.166
like something
from a movie.

03:19.233 --> 03:20.368
Not a good movie.

03:20.434 --> 03:21.602
One of those crappy ones

03:21.669 --> 03:23.904
mom watches while
she eats chocolate.

03:25.105 --> 03:27.375
Well, we got
engaged anyway.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.610
So we have a bad
proposal story.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.512
But we always
said one day,

03:31.579 --> 03:33.914
we'd look back
at it and laugh.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.048
(LAUGHS)

03:35.115 --> 03:36.817
And that day's
not today.

03:45.859 --> 03:48.629
Okay, Mr. Stanovich,
I'll see you real soon.

03:48.696 --> 03:51.932
Oh, for your follow-up visit,
not, you know, your dirt nap.

03:53.434 --> 03:56.136
Wow, Dr. Park.
That's some costume.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.571
Yeah, maybe next year,

03:57.638 --> 03:59.507
you could come as something
more appropriate for a doctor.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.209
Like, literally anything.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.578
Whatever. At least
my costume makes sense.

04:04.645 --> 04:05.779
What are you
supposed to be?

04:05.846 --> 04:08.349
Duh. I'm Bumble Beyonce.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.723
You don't know.
You don't know Beyonce.

04:17.791 --> 04:20.561
So, what's, uh,
this whole...mess?

04:20.628 --> 04:23.664
I'm Khaleesi from
Game Of Thrones.

04:24.465 --> 04:25.833
Oh.

04:25.899 --> 04:26.967
I'm Pat, an adult,

04:27.034 --> 04:28.736
from this professional
place of business.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.472
Oh, may I?
Uh, sure.

04:31.539 --> 04:33.073
Ah.
Um, Pat.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.241
Remember when I told you

04:34.308 --> 04:35.909
the coffee maker was
broken in the lounge?

04:35.976 --> 04:37.811
Mmm-hmm.
Well, it's worse now.

04:37.878 --> 04:40.781
When you push "brew",
fire comes out.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.784
My advice?

04:43.851 --> 04:45.085
Don't push "brew".

04:48.556 --> 04:49.823
Hey, what's up?

04:52.660 --> 04:54.862
He is not in
the Halloween spirit.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.564
Halloween's stupid, anyway.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.198
All right,
what's the matter?

04:58.265 --> 04:59.299
We finally told the kids

04:59.367 --> 05:01.369
about how I proposed
to Allison on Halloween.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.337
You proposed
on Halloween?

05:03.404 --> 05:05.773
That is so sweet
and original.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.643
No? Why?
It wasn't good?

05:09.710 --> 05:11.545
He slit her throat?

05:13.747 --> 05:16.116
No. This means "stop!"

05:16.183 --> 05:18.752
This means "stop."

05:18.819 --> 05:21.755
You would be a
terrifying crossing guard.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.925
Anyway...

05:24.992 --> 05:27.595
For 20 years, we've had
to tell that crappy story,

05:27.661 --> 05:28.729
and I'm sick of it.

05:28.796 --> 05:29.863
She deserves a better one.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.331
So do it over.

05:31.399 --> 05:33.100
Oh, sure. I'll just
jump in my time machine.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.535
Hey, maybe while
I'm back there,

05:34.602 --> 05:36.504
I'll give the Menendez
parents a heads-up.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.740
No, I mean,
like, re-propose.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.108
That's totally a thing.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.610
(SNAPS FINGERS)
You're right.
That is a thing.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.545
You know what?
I'm gonna re-propose to her.

05:44.612 --> 05:46.013
Oh, you know
what you should do?

05:46.079 --> 05:47.748
Skywriting.

05:47.815 --> 05:51.485
(GASPS) Great idea, because
nothing says, "I love you
but hate the environment",

05:51.552 --> 05:52.986
like skywriting.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.326
You know what?
It's Halloween.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.662
I bet I could do it exactly
the way I first planned it

06:01.729 --> 06:03.363
and she would love that.

06:03.431 --> 06:05.365
I wonder if Captain Spooky's
carnival is still around.

06:05.433 --> 06:07.100
Oh, yeah.
It's still there.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.069
Even after that thing
with the masked fondler
in the hay-bale maze?

06:09.136 --> 06:11.338
That was three years ago,
and they caught that lady.

06:12.239 --> 06:13.273
This is great.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.675
We're supposed to go
to a party, but instead,

06:14.742 --> 06:16.343
I'll take her back there
and surprise her.

06:16.410 --> 06:18.245
I'm even gonna
get her a new ring.

06:18.311 --> 06:19.780
When we got married,
all I could afford

06:19.847 --> 06:21.915
was the heirloom
I bought from my grandmother.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.784
You bought it from
your grandmother?

06:23.851 --> 06:26.286
Yeah, and I did not
get a good deal.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.790
After tonight,
we're gonna have a story

06:29.857 --> 06:32.059
that everyone likes to tell.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.461
(CHUCKLES)

06:33.527 --> 06:35.563
Take me! Please?

06:37.230 --> 06:39.132
Yeah, maybe this isn't
the best costume.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.206
Damona.
DAMONA: Huh?

06:46.273 --> 06:47.908
I have a major problem.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.910
Are you the one who dropped
her lipstick in the toilet?

06:49.977 --> 06:52.646
Leave it, girl.
Just leave it.

06:52.713 --> 06:55.749
No! I gave Pat
a fentanyl lollipop.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.785
You gave him
a super-high-grade narcotic?

06:57.851 --> 06:58.952
By accident!

06:59.019 --> 07:00.654
Oh!

07:00.721 --> 07:02.322
A drug rep gave
me these samples

07:02.389 --> 07:04.224
for patients who
can't swallow pills,

07:04.291 --> 07:06.594
and I was distracted,
and Pat took one off my desk.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.996
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Okay, okay! Stop!

07:09.062 --> 07:10.230
Calm down.

07:10.297 --> 07:11.632
You know what you need?

07:13.634 --> 07:15.068
No!
Okay!

07:15.135 --> 07:16.804
For all we know,
he didn't even
eat that thing.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.672
Hey, everybody!

07:18.739 --> 07:20.173
Everybody!

07:20.240 --> 07:23.110
Every...bo...dy!

07:24.845 --> 07:25.979
He ate that thing.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.447
Mmm-hmm.

07:27.515 --> 07:29.717
Oh, God.
I dosed my boss.
Mmm-hmm.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.853
Hey, Ju...lie.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.622
Do you remember that
lollipop you gave me?

07:34.688 --> 07:35.856
Uh-huh.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.625
Well, I just wanted
to say thank you.

07:37.691 --> 07:40.528
Those things are
scrumdiddlyumptious!

07:40.961 --> 07:42.295
(LAUGHS)

07:42.362 --> 07:44.665
I didn't even know
I knew that word!

07:49.537 --> 07:51.639
Oh! Allison is
gonna love it!

07:51.705 --> 07:53.240
I know.

07:53.306 --> 07:56.043
This re-proposal's
gonna make my original
proposal its bitch.

07:57.545 --> 07:59.246
Sorry. I'm having
trouble with your card.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.881
Uh, I'll try it again.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.250
(CELLPHONE RINGS)

08:03.316 --> 08:04.685
(WHISPERS) Oh, Allison.
Oh.

08:04.752 --> 08:06.019
Hello, my dear.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.287
Ken, are you shopping?

08:07.354 --> 08:08.689
No, I'm at work.

08:08.756 --> 08:11.324
Paging Dr. Ken.
Dr. Kendrick Park...

08:12.192 --> 08:13.360
What's up?

08:13.426 --> 08:15.028
Well, the credit card
company called.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.630
Someone's trying to use
our card at a jewelry store.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.799
A jewelry store?
(CHUCKLES)

08:18.866 --> 08:21.001
A jewelry store?
(LAUGHS)

08:21.068 --> 08:22.670
A jewelry store.

08:22.736 --> 08:25.072
I tell you, everyone
here at the HMO
where I currently am

08:25.138 --> 08:26.674
is wondering why I keep
saying "a jewelry store."

08:27.975 --> 08:29.577
Okay, I guess
I'll just cancel the card.

08:29.643 --> 08:30.844
Oh, no, no, no.
I'll take care of it.

08:30.911 --> 08:33.313
Okay, but I need you
to actually take care of it.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.615
Why wouldn't I?

08:34.682 --> 08:36.283
Because you didn't actually
take care of our taxes

08:36.349 --> 08:38.552
or our mortgage payment,
or the life insurance.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.754
Okay, the life-insurance
thing would have
been a big deal

08:40.821 --> 08:43.591
had one of us died,
but we didn't.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.158
You always ignore
the financial stuff,

08:45.225 --> 08:46.660
and it always falls on me.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.295
Yeah, well, you know,
I'm really busy at work.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.731
Oh. (LAUGHS)
Here we go.

08:50.798 --> 08:52.666
I work, too, Ken.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.501
I was with a patient
when the credit-card
company called.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.770
I'm sorry. It's not
like one of your
patients is gonna die

08:56.837 --> 08:58.572
if you answer your phone.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.273
Oh, and someone's
gonna die if you
answer the phone? Please.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.409
It's family medicine,
not the ER.

09:02.475 --> 09:04.244
The most serious thing
you've dealt with

09:04.311 --> 09:05.879
is an ingrown toenail.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.147
First of all,
you know
that's not true.

09:07.214 --> 09:10.083
And second of all,
that toenail was jacked up!

09:10.618 --> 09:11.652
Whatever.

09:11.719 --> 09:12.753
"Whatever" to you!

09:15.155 --> 09:16.624
Forget it.
I wouldn't re-propose

09:16.690 --> 09:19.359
to that chardonnay-crazed
bog witch
in a million years!

09:35.375 --> 09:36.844
I should just tell
Pat what happened

09:36.910 --> 09:38.111
and take
the consequences.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.546
Are you crazy?

09:39.613 --> 09:41.581
You dosed your boss
without his consent,

09:41.649 --> 09:44.484
and now he is
spinning in a chair!

09:44.551 --> 09:46.654
No, there is
only one thing to do here.

09:47.821 --> 09:48.856
Hey, Pat.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.190
Pat, Pat, Pat.

09:51.692 --> 09:52.793
You know how we need

09:52.860 --> 09:54.294
one of those coffee
makers in the lounge?

09:54.361 --> 09:55.863
Wouldn't it be nice
to have a fancy one

09:55.929 --> 09:57.297
that made lattes
and stuff?

09:57.364 --> 09:59.366
Yes! That would be nice.

10:00.634 --> 10:03.403
I love lattes.
We should totally do that.

10:03.470 --> 10:04.571
Carry on!

10:06.974 --> 10:08.408
And that's how
you do that.

10:15.348 --> 10:16.516
(PANTING)

10:16.583 --> 10:17.751
Clark.
What are you doing here?

10:17.818 --> 10:19.286
I need to talk to you.

10:19.352 --> 10:20.487
If you're ready to discuss

10:20.553 --> 10:22.222
that imaginary friend
you had in college,

10:22.289 --> 10:23.791
you have to make
an appointment.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.225
You know what?

10:25.292 --> 10:27.194
I don't think it's gonna be
productive to talk about Keith

10:27.260 --> 10:29.362
until he is willing
to come in with me.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.900
It's about Ken.
What is it?

10:32.966 --> 10:34.835
That fraud alert
you got earlier?

10:34.902 --> 10:36.636
It was him.

10:36.704 --> 10:37.838
Oh, God!

10:37.905 --> 10:39.239
Look, you can't
know any of this,

10:39.306 --> 10:41.875
but he was out buying
you a new engagement ring

10:41.942 --> 10:44.211
as part of this
super-romantic re-proposal

10:44.277 --> 10:45.946
that he was
planning for tonight.

10:46.013 --> 10:48.181
(CHUCKLING)
Oh, that is so sweet!

10:48.248 --> 10:50.317
That doesn't sound
like Ken at all.

10:50.383 --> 10:51.451
I know. Right?

10:51.518 --> 10:53.787
Wait. what do you mean
he was planning?

10:53.854 --> 10:55.522
Well, then you guys
got into that fight,

10:55.588 --> 10:57.991
and his face turned the color
of an angry Wyoming sunset,

10:58.058 --> 10:59.326
and then I tried on
a pair of earrings

10:59.392 --> 11:01.028
that were stunning
but weren't me.

11:02.863 --> 11:05.232
And now he doesn't even
wanna do it anymore.

11:05.298 --> 11:06.734
Oh, no!

11:06.800 --> 11:09.102
He was trying to be romantic,
and I ruined it!
Mmm-hmm.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.071
Just like I ruined
his first proposal!

11:11.138 --> 11:12.672
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.
(GASPS)

11:12.740 --> 11:14.975
I'm becoming the evil
wife who ruins things,

11:15.042 --> 11:16.409
just like in that movie
I watched last week

11:16.476 --> 11:18.078
while I was
eating chocolate.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.646
(GROANS)
I got to fix this.

11:21.548 --> 11:22.716
Good luck.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.152
Oh, now you show up.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.157
Classic Keith.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.629
Hey, you guys are doing
great work out there!

11:37.330 --> 11:39.299
Hey! Do you like rush?

11:39.366 --> 11:41.134
Do you like rush!

11:41.201 --> 11:43.503
This drum solo is sick.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.839
I mean, you know,
good sick, not sick sick.

11:45.906 --> 11:50.243
Although, if it was
sick sick, I'm sure you
guys could heal it.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.412
'Cause you're doing
great work out there!

11:52.479 --> 11:54.047
(BOTH LAUGH)

11:54.948 --> 11:56.383
This is amazing!

11:58.118 --> 11:59.619
What should we
ask him for next?

11:59.686 --> 12:02.289
Oh! Oh, okay!
How about casual Fridays?

12:02.355 --> 12:04.892
No, no, no, no.
Ultra-casual Fridays.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.860
I'm talking
sweatpants and no bra.

12:06.927 --> 12:07.928
(LAUGHS)

12:07.995 --> 12:09.496
Let these puppies play.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.630
Whoo!

12:10.697 --> 12:11.698
Oh.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.834
Whoa. Where's Pat?

12:13.901 --> 12:15.002
He was just right there.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.369
No. No. No.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.205
No! No! Pat?

12:18.271 --> 12:19.706
You said you'd keep
an eye on him.

12:19.773 --> 12:21.942
No, no, no! You said
you'd keep an eye on him.

12:22.009 --> 12:23.944
You were freaking out so much,
I had to keep an eye on you!

12:24.011 --> 12:25.412
Well, you didn't do
a very good job,

12:25.478 --> 12:27.380
because you let me
let him escape!

12:27.447 --> 12:28.448
(THUD)

12:31.284 --> 12:33.686
Oh!
Hey.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.755
I slammed my
hand in the door.

12:35.823 --> 12:36.924
Check it out.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.859
DAMONA: Oh! Snap!

12:38.926 --> 12:41.061
That's not how
it's supposed to be, right?

12:41.128 --> 12:42.762
Oh, no. Pat, man.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.731
Is it weird
I don't feel anything?

12:44.798 --> 12:46.433
JULIA: Yep. Oh, boy.

12:46.499 --> 12:47.835
Don't play with it.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.169
Oh, Pat!

12:53.606 --> 12:54.607
(DOOR OPENS)

12:56.409 --> 12:58.311
Oh, hey, Molly.
You went
trick-or-treating, too?

12:58.378 --> 13:00.347
That looks like
a rich harvest.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.216
No.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.885
It's Gary!
(GASPS)

13:04.952 --> 13:07.988
Dad is gonna be so mad!
He loves Gary!

13:08.055 --> 13:09.957
It wasn't my fault.
I was driving with him.

13:10.023 --> 13:13.460
I stopped short, and he
wasn't wearing his seatbelt.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.762
Man, you are so dead.

13:15.829 --> 13:16.997
I know.

13:17.064 --> 13:19.266
Dad is gonna
ground me forever.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.334
Or until I die
from lecture poisoning.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.872
Hey, guys.
What's that?

13:24.938 --> 13:25.973
Nothing.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.041
It's my period stuff!

13:28.108 --> 13:29.442
Ew!

13:29.509 --> 13:30.810
Okay. Ah!

13:30.878 --> 13:32.812
I could have accidentally
seen something.

13:37.084 --> 13:38.118
Wife.

13:38.886 --> 13:39.987
Hi, honey.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.922
I'm all ready
for the party.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.390
But what about our fight?

13:43.456 --> 13:44.992
Insults were lobbed.
"Whatevers" were hurled.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.894
Angry texts were written
and then wisely deleted.

13:48.095 --> 13:50.697
Let's just move past it.
It's Halloween.

13:50.763 --> 13:52.832
I've been standing here
dressed as a witch

13:52.900 --> 13:55.602
for almost a minute,
and you haven't said...

13:55.668 --> 13:56.769
"What? No costume?"

13:56.836 --> 13:57.905
(LAUGHS)

13:59.739 --> 14:01.141
Oh, come on!

14:01.208 --> 14:03.043
(SIGHS) All right,
I'm sorry about earlier.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.244
But you were right.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.845
I do work fewer
hours than you,

14:05.913 --> 14:08.281
and it makes sense
for me to handle
the bills and stuff, okay?

14:08.348 --> 14:09.682
Come on.

14:09.749 --> 14:12.285
Now, go throw
on that sexy grim
reaper costume,

14:12.352 --> 14:14.787
and let's do our
Halloween as planned.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.957
Yeah, 'cause I love you,

14:17.024 --> 14:18.858
and there's no
reason for anyone

14:18.926 --> 14:21.728
not to do what they were
planning on doing tonight.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.736
I'm sorry. I just had to say
something. (CHUCKLES)

14:29.802 --> 14:32.505
I feel like this is
a big step in our marriage,

14:32.572 --> 14:34.908
'cause you never admit
when you're wrong.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.609
So this is
progress for you.

14:36.676 --> 14:38.478
Yep. (CHUCKLES)

14:38.545 --> 14:39.612
So, get dressed.

14:39.679 --> 14:41.214
You know, stop talking
for a little bit.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.682
Grab your death stick.

14:42.749 --> 14:46.019
No, no. This is a real
teachable moment for you.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.154
Some mistakes...

14:47.220 --> 14:48.421
Go!

14:48.488 --> 14:49.923
I don't wanna be late.
(CHUCKLES)

14:59.266 --> 15:00.500
Kneecap.

15:02.435 --> 15:03.703
Pliers.

15:05.705 --> 15:06.940
Yum-yum.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.945
Do we really have to do
this whole surgery routine?

15:12.012 --> 15:14.881
The way our costumes line up,
we'd be fools not to.

15:16.283 --> 15:18.018
Fine.
Let's just finish this.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.020
Shinbone.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.689
(GASPS)
It's not in here!

15:22.755 --> 15:23.756
Dad's gonna kill us!

15:23.823 --> 15:24.924
What do you mean "us"?

15:24.992 --> 15:26.526
You're the one
who broke Gary.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.595
But you helped me
cover it up.

15:28.661 --> 15:32.765
Like it or not, your scent
is all over this now, Dave.

15:32.832 --> 15:34.334
Oh, no!

15:34.401 --> 15:36.803
Wait. The Kramers have
a Halloween skeleton
on their porch.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.638
We can just take
one of its shinbones.

15:38.705 --> 15:39.806
That'll work, right?

15:39.872 --> 15:41.975
It better.
I just got all this candy.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.710
I have so much to lose!

15:47.047 --> 15:49.549
Oh, this place
hasn't changed much.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.651
Ah. I see they
added a scarecrow.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.120
Oh, no, that's
just the meth-head

15:53.186 --> 15:55.922
that unloads
the pumpkins.

15:55.989 --> 15:59.092
Cider-keep,
one cup for my lady, please,

15:59.159 --> 16:00.927
for old times' sake.

16:00.994 --> 16:02.962
Oh, crap.
I left my wallet
in my car.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.131
Do you mind paying?

16:04.197 --> 16:05.265
Sure.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.399
Wow.

16:06.466 --> 16:07.634
Just hours ago,

16:07.700 --> 16:10.037
something like
that could have
really set you off.

16:10.103 --> 16:11.371
(CHUCKLING) Okay.

16:11.438 --> 16:12.839
But you realized
you were wrong.

16:12.905 --> 16:14.074
Sure did.

16:14.141 --> 16:16.176
And you took
the necessary steps
to make it right.

16:16.243 --> 16:17.977
Good for you.
That's it.

16:18.045 --> 16:20.080
I take back my apology.

16:20.147 --> 16:21.814
You do dump all
the money stuff on me,

16:21.881 --> 16:23.916
even though I work
every bit as much as you do.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.052
What?
But you just said...

16:25.118 --> 16:26.286
I know what I just said!

16:26.353 --> 16:27.820
I was just trying
to patch things up

16:27.887 --> 16:30.190
so you'd still do
your re-proposal thing.

16:30.257 --> 16:31.858
Wait. You knew about this?

16:31.924 --> 16:33.360
That totally ruins it!

16:33.426 --> 16:34.627
What is it with you?

16:34.694 --> 16:36.529
It's like
your hatred of proposals

16:36.596 --> 16:38.831
is rivaled only by
your love of ruining.

16:38.898 --> 16:40.733
I'm not trying
to ruin anything!

16:40.800 --> 16:42.402
You're the one
who couldn't
accept my apology

16:42.469 --> 16:43.936
without gloating
like an idiot.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.505
Your false apology!

16:45.572 --> 16:48.275
Or, as they call it
in Germany,
"A Portuguese I'm sorry"!

16:49.742 --> 16:51.911
Just do it so
we can go home.

16:52.312 --> 16:53.813
Fine.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.983
I found my speech
from 20 years ago.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.318
Super.

16:58.385 --> 16:59.786
There was also
supposed to be a ring,

16:59.852 --> 17:01.454
but I think we know
how that played out.

17:03.623 --> 17:06.959
"Allison, the verdict is in.
We're really good together."

17:07.026 --> 17:08.361
Not gonna jump in here?

17:08.428 --> 17:10.163
Because this is
where you
ruined the first one.

17:10.230 --> 17:11.564
Hurry up.

17:11.631 --> 17:12.832
There's a box of
chardonnay in the fridge

17:12.899 --> 17:14.867
I actually do wanna spend
the rest of my life with.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.338
Hey! I recognize you two.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.773
You proposed here.
You remember that?

17:20.840 --> 17:23.110
Sure. The carnival doesn't
get a lot of proposals.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.744
Yeah.

17:24.811 --> 17:26.779
I put one of the
polaroids I took of you
on the bulletin board,

17:26.846 --> 17:28.081
next to the picture
of the guy

17:28.148 --> 17:30.350
that keeps trying to
have sex with the pumpkins.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.822
20 years. Wow.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.891
So? How did it go?

17:38.958 --> 17:40.993
Good. You know,
we got married.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.762
Both graduated
and got jobs.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.564
Bought a house,
had two kids.

17:44.631 --> 17:46.466
Beautiful kids.

17:46.533 --> 17:47.967
Well, sounds like
it went pretty good.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.837
Yeah.

17:50.903 --> 17:51.938
I guess it did.

17:53.973 --> 17:55.242
Well, that's good.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.577
I love a story
with a happy ending.

17:57.644 --> 18:00.147
I also love stories
with robots.

18:01.881 --> 18:05.485
Hey, let me take a picture,
like I did 20 years ago.

18:05.552 --> 18:08.355
You know what? I think
I got a better pose for you.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.763
Allison...

18:16.829 --> 18:18.765
I always knew
I loved you,

18:18.831 --> 18:20.800
(VOICE BREAKING) but I had
no idea how amazing it'd be

18:20.867 --> 18:22.802
to build a family
and a life with you.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.204
(SNIFFLES)

18:24.271 --> 18:26.005
But I do now.

18:26.072 --> 18:27.907
And I love you
more than ever.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.845
So, will you marry me...
Again?

18:33.480 --> 18:35.148
I will.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.749
(APPLAUDING)

18:42.222 --> 18:44.123
Hey, buddy, I couldn't
get my flash to work.

18:44.191 --> 18:45.392
You mind
doing that again?

18:47.126 --> 18:48.795
Who can figure these out?

18:57.069 --> 18:59.239
So, we acted out the
proposal two more times

18:59.306 --> 19:01.508
while Captain Spooky
messed with his phone.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.843
Eventually, we just
took a selfie with ours.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.446
Aww!
Aww!

19:06.513 --> 19:08.881
And now we have
a proposal story
that we both like to tell.

19:08.948 --> 19:11.218
Oh, hey, look. There's
a scarecrow in the background.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.552
Yep. That's a scarecrow.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.621
Mmm-hmm.

19:14.687 --> 19:17.524
Cool. Well, things
were boring
and uneventful here.

19:17.590 --> 19:18.858
So... Now that
you're home,

19:18.925 --> 19:20.260
I'm gonna head
over to Kendra's.

19:20.327 --> 19:21.994
Okay. Be home by 12:00.

19:22.061 --> 19:23.296
And bedtime for you.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.498
I'll lie down, but with
all the sugar in my veins,

19:25.565 --> 19:27.600
we both know
it's just a charade.

19:30.737 --> 19:31.838
Oh, hey,
I thought you took Gary

19:31.904 --> 19:33.139
over to Kendra's
for the party.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.575
Oh, yeah.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.577
I was gonna, but I know
how valuable he is to you,

19:37.644 --> 19:39.612
and I just didn't
wanna risk anything.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.481
You know what, Molly?

19:41.548 --> 19:43.115
Sometimes, we don't
give you enough credit
for being responsible.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.951
You don't. But thanks.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.555
(SIGHS)

19:51.224 --> 19:52.225
Molly!

19:58.898 --> 20:00.433
Pat! What happened
to your hand?

20:00.500 --> 20:01.834
I don't know!

20:03.736 --> 20:05.037
Damona?

20:05.104 --> 20:07.307
Who said you could come
to work in sweatpants?

20:08.140 --> 20:10.610
You did, yesterday.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.011
Well, then
I guess it's okay.

20:12.078 --> 20:13.112
(GROANS)

20:13.179 --> 20:15.815
Son of a biscuit! Ah!

20:15.882 --> 20:17.784
All right, everybody
works through lunch.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.288
I miss fun Pat.

20:21.354 --> 20:23.256
Yeah, I do, too,
but I have a feeling

20:23.323 --> 20:25.191
his legacy is
going to live on.

20:25.258 --> 20:26.693
What's that?

20:26.759 --> 20:29.396
Well, yesterday,
I had him sign
30 blank request forms.

20:31.197 --> 20:33.232
I want an electric stapler.
(CHUCKLES)

20:33.300 --> 20:34.601
Ooh! And some
kind of device

20:34.667 --> 20:36.403
that keeps lipstick
out of the toilet.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.340
I'm gonna mark
that one "urgent."

20:44.143 --> 20:47.179
No, I don't know what's
going on, either, Keith.
