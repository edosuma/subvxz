I just felt so strong,

32:08.416 --> 32:11.016
like life had given me a second chance.

Can I... can I talk to
you about something?

But you stopped that.

It was my pleasure.

Truly.

But you have to leave.

33:05.506 --> 33:08.407
It kills me to say this, but...

in an impossible position.

- I wish it could be different.
- It's okay.

I guess my coming here was kind of...

It was my own self-denial.

I know you're right.

33:55.723 --> 33:58.291
Hey, you should get back to sleep.

of getting me not to go to the meeting?

You know, Norman, sometimes
you can be so full of yourself.

35:21.797 --> 35:23.564
No, no... this is not my way

36:18.120 --> 36:20.688
Norman, you do not have autonomy here.

36:20.689 --> 36:22.823
You can't just make unilateral decisions

you're the little dictator.
