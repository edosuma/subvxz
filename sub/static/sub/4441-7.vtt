So how are things
going with Amanda?

00:10.988 --> 00:12.122
Great.
Oh!

00:12.123 --> 00:13.890
She left for San Diego
this morning.

00:13.891 --> 00:16.125
Well, at least she doesn't have
a dog you have to watch.

00:17.161 --> 00:18.295
How about you?

00:18.296 --> 00:19.796
Have you spoken to Dr. Ramos?

00:19.797 --> 00:23.034
Are you kidding me?
No, I'm done with Arturo.

00:23.035 --> 00:25.871
(Whiny): "I can't leave my family.
My kids need me."

00:25.872 --> 00:28.407
Please. That's bullshit.
They're, like, nine years old.

00:28.408 --> 00:30.443
It's his loss.
You look radiant.

00:30.444 --> 00:33.179
People say "radiant"...
what they mean is "fat."

00:33.180 --> 00:35.649
I mean, look at this tub of
"radiance" checking me out.

00:35.650 --> 00:39.787
Where does he get off?
Like we're on the same team.

00:39.788 --> 00:40.889
You gonna finish these fries?

00:40.890 --> 00:41.789

01:00.545 --> 01:01.845
Best coffee in town.

01:01.846 --> 01:03.546
Oh! Coffee!

01:03.547 --> 01:05.715

01:05.716 --> 01:08.152

01:08.153 --> 01:10.187
You know, dude from first
year contracts class?

01:10.188 --> 01:12.690
(Old man voice):
Stomp on that banana!

01:12.691 --> 01:13.991
(Forced laughter)

01:13.992 --> 01:16.227
I don't get it.

01:16.228 --> 01:18.129
That's an... inside joke.

01:18.130 --> 01:20.398
(Laughing):
So funny, though.

01:23.269 --> 01:25.304
Wow, man, it's really
been too long.

01:25.305 --> 01:26.572
You know, I thought
that I would see you

01:26.573 --> 01:28.507
at your dad's banquet, but...

01:28.508 --> 01:30.676
You know, I mean, I understand.

01:30.677 --> 01:32.745
Yeah. Yeah, I was busy...
out of town.

01:32.746 --> 01:34.047
Anyway,
it was great to see you...

01:34.048 --> 01:36.650
Hey, man, listen...
I'm going to the Saloon tonight.

01:36.651 --> 01:39.720
Maybe you should come down.
Have a drink.

01:39.721 --> 01:42.733
Might give us
a chance to... catch up.

01:42.734 --> 01:44.858
- It sounds like fun.
- See?

01:46.862 --> 01:48.096
Yeah.

01:48.097 --> 01:49.664
- Maybe I'll stop by.
- Awesome.

01:49.665 --> 01:51.933
Or should I say...
(Loud whisper): Fresca!

01:51.934 --> 01:54.402
(Forced laughter)
I bet that's funny.

01:54.403 --> 01:55.770
Yeah.

01:55.771 --> 01:57.773
All right, man,
I hope to see you there.

01:57.774 --> 01:59.508
Bye.

01:59.509 --> 02:01.577
He's so cute.

02:01.578 --> 02:04.547
You know, he always had
a massive crush on me.

02:04.548 --> 02:06.515
You think he likes kids?

02:06.516 --> 02:08.818
I don't know and I don't care.

02:08.818 --> 02:10.387
I don't want anything to do
with that guy.

02:10.388 --> 02:12.289
What?!

02:12.290 --> 02:14.898
I mean, I know it's been a while
since you guys have talked,

02:14.899 --> 02:17.460
but you were, like, best friends.
What happened?

02:17.461 --> 02:18.662
WILFRED:
Ryan! Look!

02:18.663 --> 02:21.932
I'm a dog! I'm a dog!

02:21.933 --> 02:24.468
So, who was that
brig-white-teeth guy?

02:24.469 --> 02:27.438
His name is James.
We went to law school together.

02:27.439 --> 02:29.273
And...?

02:29.274 --> 02:31.609
(Sighs heavily)

02:31.610 --> 02:34.846
We both worked for my dad,
and we hated it.

02:34.847 --> 02:36.848
We decided to leave and start

02:36.849 --> 02:38.283
our own boutique
law firm together.

02:38.284 --> 02:39.384
Boutique?

02:39.385 --> 02:40.552
So you'd represent jewelry

02:40.553 --> 02:42.988
and effeminate
trinkets and such?

02:42.989 --> 02:45.190
It was gonna be a place where
the disenfranchised

02:45.191 --> 02:47.426
could get help and where
ethics actually mattered.

02:47.427 --> 02:49.895
We decided to quit
on the same day,

02:49.896 --> 02:52.298
but at the last minute,
James took a promotion

02:52.299 --> 02:53.966
and stayed
with my dad instead.

02:53.967 --> 02:55.401
What a dick!

02:55.402 --> 02:56.969
What did he have
to say for himself?

02:56.970 --> 02:58.972
I never took his calls.

02:58.973 --> 03:00.741
What's he gonna say,
"Yeah, I know you thought

03:00.742 --> 03:02.642
I was your best friend,
but I stabbed you in the back"?

03:02.643 --> 03:05.145
So you're just gonna avoid him
for the rest of your life?

03:05.146 --> 03:07.114
You should at least hear
his side of the story.

03:07.115 --> 03:08.315
I already know
his side of the story.

03:08.316 --> 03:09.750
Well, maybe you got it wrong.

03:09.751 --> 03:11.519
The only way to know
for sure is to talk to him.

03:11.520 --> 03:13.888
I mean, this guy was
your best friend.

03:13.889 --> 03:15.323
Why are you shutting him out?

03:15.324 --> 03:18.326
I'd never do that
to my best friend...

03:18.327 --> 03:19.294
Dennis.

stomping down the hallway.

Maybe.
I don't remember.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.006
Hey, are you hungry?

10:58.007 --> 11:00.175
I'm hungry.

11:00.176 --> 11:02.977
Yeah, sure, whatever.

11:02.978 --> 11:04.946
I just thought that maybe
we should, you know,

11:04.947 --> 11:07.215
- talk about what happened.
- Water under the bridge.

11:07.216 --> 11:08.883
Yeah, but I was just...
We're good.

11:10.620 --> 11:12.187
All right. Cool.

11:19.662 --> 11:20.896
Excuse me.

11:22.699 --> 11:24.066
Hey-ey, what
a coincidence!

11:24.067 --> 11:26.201
What are you doing here?

11:26.202 --> 11:28.537
I'm meeting Dennis
for a drink next door.

11:28.538 --> 11:30.072
Unless you feel like dancing.

11:30.073 --> 11:33.242
We still have a lot of work
to do before the recital.

11:33.243 --> 11:35.377
I'm kinda busy right now.

11:35.378 --> 11:36.745
Go home, Wilfred.

11:36.746 --> 11:38.547
Those teeth in there,
are they James'?

11:38.548 --> 11:41.217
He has less hair
than I remember.

11:41.218 --> 11:41.984
He has hair.

11:41.985 --> 11:42.985
Not as much as me.

11:42.986 --> 11:44.087
He's human.

11:44.088 --> 11:45.689
So, you planning on
dancing together?

11:45.690 --> 11:47.758
Is he a better dancer than me?

11:47.759 --> 11:49.626
You gonna give him
a little treat afterwards?

11:49.627 --> 11:53.163
Christ, will you just stop?!
Go away!

11:53.164 --> 11:55.498
<i>I don't want to dance
with you anymore, okay?</i>

11:55.499 --> 11:57.400
Go dance with your
best friend Dennis.

11:58.635 --> 12:01.403
I can't dance with Dennis.

12:01.404 --> 12:03.638
Why, because Dennis
doesn't exist?

12:03.639 --> 12:06.608
No. Because Dennis is
severely disabled.

12:06.609 --> 12:09.826
He can barely feed himself,
let alone dance.

12:09.827 --> 12:11.613
Oh, but you were gonna go
and have a drink with him?

12:11.614 --> 12:14.282
Drinking is all he has, Ryan.

12:14.283 --> 12:17.485
(Chuckles) Look, you're
obviously upset.

12:17.486 --> 12:19.254
Why don't we...?
I can cancel with Dennis

12:19.255 --> 12:21.456
and we can just go back
to your place,

12:21.457 --> 12:23.692
put on a little bit of Sade...

12:23.693 --> 12:24.793
I said go home!

12:26.862 --> 12:28.763
Can I see your ID?

12:37.648 --> 12:38.681
Dude...

12:49.823 --> 12:52.557
(Banging noise)

12:52.558 --> 12:53.691
Wilfred?

12:53.692 --> 12:54.959
(Banging continues)

12:54.960 --> 12:56.893
Wilfred, are you down here?

13:05.493 --> 13:07.698
(Gasps)
Have a nice night, Ryan?

13:07.699 --> 13:08.465
You scared me.

13:10.535 --> 13:13.770
Your shoes look pretty worn.

13:13.771 --> 13:16.272
Wonder what that's all about.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.940
You shouldn't be down here.
Jenna will be looking for you.

13:18.941 --> 13:21.075
Jenna's asleep.
She won't hear a thing.

13:21.076 --> 13:22.576
I'm going upstairs.

13:22.577 --> 13:23.743
What are you doing?!

13:23.744 --> 13:25.144
I'm dancing!

13:25.145 --> 13:28.512
And after we dance,
I get my treat!

13:28.513 --> 13:30.480
That's how it works!

13:30.481 --> 13:33.348
Wilfred, no!

13:33.349 --> 13:35.883
(Ryan gasping)

13:45.421 --> 13:47.255
Give me my goddamn treat!

13:47.256 --> 13:49.256
Wilfred, please, just go home!

13:49.257 --> 13:52.458
Open this door, Ryan!
Open the door!

13:57.039 --> 14:00.140
I miss you, too, but Comic-Con
sounds like a blast.

14:00.141 --> 14:02.643
Maybe I'll go with you next year.

14:02.644 --> 14:04.511
No, I'd dress up!

14:04.512 --> 14:06.414
I could totally pass
as Harry Potter.

14:08.036 --> 14:09.183
(Knocking)

14:14.223 --> 14:16.691
Hey, Amanda, I'll call you back.

14:19.428 --> 14:20.861
What do you want?

14:20.862 --> 14:23.498
I brought you your slipper.

14:23.499 --> 14:25.433
Where's my other one?

14:25.434 --> 14:28.704
Yeah, you don't want
the other one.

14:28.705 --> 14:30.873
Look, I'm sorry about last night.

14:30.874 --> 14:32.675
I obviously got a little carried away.

14:32.676 --> 14:35.745
I know what you're gonna say,
so you don't need to say it.

14:35.746 --> 14:37.447
- I just think...
- Drop it.

14:37.448 --> 14:41.017
I just want to put all this behind us,
go back to the way things were.

14:43.354 --> 14:45.021
Me, too.

14:45.022 --> 14:46.390
Friends?

14:53.831 --> 14:55.732
(Gasps)

14:55.733 --> 14:57.133
Wilfred, get off me! No!

14:57.134 --> 14:59.569
I want my treat!

14:59.570 --> 15:00.871
I can't take this anymore!

15:00.872 --> 15:02.339
Goddamn it, Wilfred!

15:02.340 --> 15:04.709
I will not let you
ejaculate all over me again!

15:06.647 --> 15:07.814
Hi, Sara.

15:09.683 --> 15:12.718
Dude!
What are you talking about?

15:12.719 --> 15:14.420
You said you wanted a treat.

15:14.421 --> 15:16.088
Is that what all this is about?

15:16.089 --> 15:17.657
All the stalking
and rapey dancing?

15:17.658 --> 15:20.259
- Yeah, because I wanted my treat!
- Exactly!

15:20.260 --> 15:21.194
A handjob!

15:21.195 --> 15:24.931
Handjob?!
I wanted a churro!

15:24.932 --> 15:27.433
Why do you think I've been
trying to dance with you?

15:27.434 --> 15:29.201
Churros only happen
after you dance.

15:29.202 --> 15:31.037
That's the first thing
you learn in conservatory!

15:31.038 --> 15:33.039
What was all this about?

15:33.040 --> 15:34.373
You know, a churro.

15:34.374 --> 15:35.875
They smother those things in sugar.

15:35.876 --> 15:37.747
You've gotta shake
some of that stuff off

15:37.748 --> 15:39.317
before you eat it.
Empty calories.

15:39.318 --> 15:42.554
Wait. That's what's been
bothering you this whole time?

15:42.555 --> 15:45.023
You thought I wanted you
to rip the neck off it?

15:45.024 --> 15:46.792
Well, yeah.

15:46.793 --> 15:49.333
This is what I'm talking about,
Ryan.

15:49.334 --> 15:51.339
You closed the door on me.

15:51.340 --> 15:55.811
If you'd just talked to me,
all of this could have been avoided.

15:55.812 --> 15:57.680
So you didn't actually enjoy that?

15:57.681 --> 15:59.748
Yeah, it was nice.

15:59.749 --> 16:02.742
But it had nothing to
do with you personally.

16:02.743 --> 16:04.041
I ejaculate on everything.

16:04.042 --> 16:06.908
I ejaculate on that...

16:06.909 --> 16:08.409
on this.

16:08.410 --> 16:10.678
I ejaculated in there.

16:10.679 --> 16:12.580
I jizzed in this, in this, in this,

16:12.581 --> 16:14.215
in this, in this in this.

16:14.216 --> 16:16.850
I jizzed over all of this.

16:16.851 --> 16:20.355
This was just an empty jar
I found in the recycle bin.

16:20.356 --> 16:22.759
Look, I had every intention
of quitting.

16:22.760 --> 16:25.494
I mean, I was nervous as
hell, but I was prepared.

16:25.495 --> 16:29.164
But when I got in there
and I was face-to-face...

16:29.165 --> 16:31.699
I froze. I mean,
you've seen your dad.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.000
He's scary as shit.

16:33.001 --> 16:35.536
I was a year out of law school.

16:35.537 --> 16:37.304
I had hundred grand
in student loans.

16:37.305 --> 16:40.040
He offered me a choice:
a fast track to partnership

16:40.041 --> 16:42.843
or be blacklisted by
every judge in the state.

16:42.844 --> 16:45.312
He said that?

16:45.313 --> 16:49.551
- My career would've been over.
- I had no idea.

16:49.552 --> 16:50.684
'Cause you didn't call me back.

16:50.685 --> 16:52.952
I know. I'm sorry.

16:52.953 --> 16:55.355
I missed you, man.

16:55.356 --> 16:57.089
I've missed you, too.

16:59.159 --> 17:00.492
(Grunts)

17:00.493 --> 17:02.160
(Both laugh)

17:03.795 --> 17:05.730
You know what the weird thing is?

17:05.731 --> 17:08.732
I don't think it's ever
been about me with your dad.

17:08.733 --> 17:10.800
<i>I just think he didn't
want to lose you.</i>

17:10.800 --> 17:13.269
I mean, ever since you left,
you're all he talks about.

17:13.270 --> 17:14.736
It's like he's obsessed.

17:14.737 --> 17:17.305
I mean, you know he wants
you back at the firm.

17:17.306 --> 17:19.569
Yeah, well,
that's never gonna happen.

17:19.570 --> 17:21.740
Mm-hmm.

17:21.741 --> 17:24.809
As your friend, be careful.

17:24.810 --> 17:28.845
He will do whatever it
takes to get you back.

17:28.846 --> 17:31.914
He's like...
He's like Darth Vader.

17:31.915 --> 17:35.451
I guess that makes you
Lando Calrissian.

17:35.452 --> 17:37.385
'Cause you double-crossed me.

17:37.386 --> 17:41.822
Oh, yeah.
And I'm smooth, too.

17:41.823 --> 17:43.257

17:43.258 --> 17:45.392
WILFRED:
Ryan, look, I'm a man!

17:45.393 --> 17:47.361
I'm a man!

17:52.133 --> 17:53.800
(Chuckles)

17:58.584 --> 18:01.319
Shit, you know what today is?

18:01.320 --> 18:02.687
The dance recital.

18:02.688 --> 18:04.122
We missed it.

18:04.123 --> 18:06.525
Why didn't you say anything?

18:06.526 --> 18:09.461
Well, I just figured that
after all that happened,

18:09.462 --> 18:11.496
you wouldn't be interested.

18:14.867 --> 18:17.402
