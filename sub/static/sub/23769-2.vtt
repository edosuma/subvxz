WEBVTT

00:18.680 --> 00:19.600
Hey.

00:20.840 --> 00:23.400
So, we didn't really get a chance to talk.

00:24.520 --> 00:25.760
Talk about what?

00:27.720 --> 00:29.240
You know, you and Daniel.

00:32.600 --> 00:35.160
I get carried away sometimes.

00:35.240 --> 00:37.720
Let's not make a big deal
out of this. Okay, Alex?

00:44.560 --> 00:46.680
It doesn't make any sense, Hayley.

00:46.760 --> 00:48.800
She changed too quickly.

00:50.400 --> 00:53.440
She couldn't stand Daniel,
and now suddenly she's all over him.

00:54.040 --> 00:56.840
Be glad you found out now
before you really fell for her.

00:56.920 --> 00:59.360
No, I know you think it's like
you and Leo, but it's not the same.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.360
Brooke doesn't care
about anyone except herself.

01:01.440 --> 01:03.960
That's why she and Daniel
are so perfect for each other.

01:04.040 --> 01:07.880
They probably had a fight and
she's just using you to get back with him.

01:08.880 --> 01:10.040
But...

01:11.040 --> 01:12.920
Daniel didn't even see us.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.120
She went off to Eric's

01:14.200 --> 01:16.560
and then she came back
a completely different person.

01:21.920 --> 01:23.080
What are you doing?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.760
[line ringing]

01:25.840 --> 01:28.400
-[Eric on phone] Hello.
-Hi, Eric. It's Hayley.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.280
-Hey, Hayley.
-I'm here with my brother.

01:30.360 --> 01:32.520
We wanted to find out
what happened with Brooke.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.360
Brooke... Uh, yeah.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.320
I took her to my office.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.720
Yeah, we looked for
the surveillance footage of the accident.

01:38.800 --> 01:41.680
We saw that nobody tampered with the car
and then we called Judy.

01:42.400 --> 01:43.960
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:44.040 --> 01:46.600
Turns out she lost an earring
while walking on that cliff

01:46.680 --> 01:48.640
and was looking all over for it.

01:48.720 --> 01:50.680
Anyway, she was in a real hurry
to get back

01:50.760 --> 01:52.880
to make up with her boyfriend
or something.

01:52.960 --> 01:54.240
So I drove her back.

01:56.360 --> 01:58.880
-Okay. Thanks, Eric.
-You're welcome.

02:01.240 --> 02:02.680
Sorry, bro.

02:06.680 --> 02:08.680
[theme music playing]

02:34.760 --> 02:35.960
[groans]

02:39.800 --> 02:41.080
Morning, sunshine.

02:41.800 --> 02:43.760
[groans] Good morning.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.400
What's this for?
It's not my birthday yet.

02:46.480 --> 02:48.760
-Just open it.
-[yawns]

02:51.480 --> 02:53.680
-Hmm.
-[chuckles softly]

02:56.800 --> 02:58.160
No way!

02:58.240 --> 03:00.160
I've wanted these so bad.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.160
Brooke, what's going on?

03:02.760 --> 03:04.560
You're finally getting rid
of your cast today,

03:04.640 --> 03:07.040
so I thought you might like a new pair.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.320
All right. [chuckles]

03:08.400 --> 03:10.080
Come on, get up! Let's go to the hospital.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.560
Wait.

03:12.640 --> 03:14.360
What made you change your mind?

03:14.960 --> 03:17.640
Yesterday, you could hardly
stand to look at me.

03:18.480 --> 03:21.440
I realized we were meant to be.

03:21.520 --> 03:22.640
[chuckles]

03:25.360 --> 03:26.360
[Leo] Hey.

03:26.440 --> 03:30.240
Hi. Now, I promise,
even though I'm your girlfriend,

03:30.320 --> 03:32.440
there won't be a conflict of interest
with you as our captain.

03:32.520 --> 03:34.160
What about your music, Aspen?

03:34.240 --> 03:37.320
It was your lifelong dream to go
to the London Conservatory.

03:37.400 --> 03:40.080
My dream is to be where my love is.

03:40.720 --> 03:44.800
If that means putting my singing career
on hold for a couple of years, so be it.

03:44.880 --> 03:47.960
But it was a big decision.
Why didn't you talk to me first?

03:48.040 --> 03:51.320
You know me.
Once I make my mind up, that's it.

03:59.320 --> 04:01.640
[water running]

04:10.960 --> 04:14.160
-Where my Eagles at? [whoops]
-[all cheering]

04:17.320 --> 04:19.079
[Daniel] That's what
I'm talking about, baby.

04:19.160 --> 04:21.640
Hey, man, chillin', chillin', chillin'.

04:21.720 --> 04:22.680
It's good to be back.

04:22.760 --> 04:24.680
[Brooke chuckling] Hey!

04:24.760 --> 04:27.240
-Hey.
-[indistinct chatter]

04:28.600 --> 04:30.960
Hey. Wait, wait, wait.
Sophie, will you take a picture of us?

04:31.040 --> 04:32.920
-Yeah, of course.
-We have to send this to your mom.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.120
-My mom?
-Yeah. She'll love it! Come on, smile!

04:35.200 --> 04:37.400
-[chuckles]
-One, two, three.

04:37.480 --> 04:39.520
-[chuckling]
-[indistinct chatter]

04:47.880 --> 04:49.560
[cell phone chimes]

04:51.960 --> 04:53.480
[clicks tongue] Aw.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.320
Look how beautiful they are.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.040
Right?

04:58.120 --> 05:01.000
One day, you're gonna pay for all this.

05:02.160 --> 05:03.600
I thought we were beyond all this.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.400
Tell that to Louis.

05:05.480 --> 05:08.520
He considered me family
and I betrayed his daughter.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.000
[sighs] Stop being so melodramatic.

05:11.080 --> 05:13.720
You did Brooke a favor
in straightening her out.

05:13.800 --> 05:16.920
And that whole "meant to be" mantra?

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
[chuckles] It was very clever.

05:31.440 --> 05:32.600
Look what she wrote.

05:33.440 --> 05:36.000
"Know that you will always be
my white knight."

05:37.880 --> 05:40.040
Now they've even taken her name
off her locker.

05:41.080 --> 05:42.680
Poor Maxy.

05:44.240 --> 05:46.680
I can't believe they replaced her so fast.

05:46.760 --> 05:50.080
Yeah, it's like they want to show us
how dispensable we all are.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.320
Why don't you just phone her?

05:54.240 --> 05:55.280
You think?

05:55.360 --> 05:58.000
Yeah, it's better than
crying over her letter, right?

05:58.080 --> 05:59.840
[Louie chimes]

06:01.200 --> 06:03.880
All right, guys. Louis wants us
to meet him in the lobby.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.120
Let's go.

06:14.280 --> 06:18.760
Hello? We're only
a point and a half ahead of the Eagles?

06:18.840 --> 06:21.640
What is this?
We must do something about this.

06:21.720 --> 06:24.240
[whispering] Let's just switch her
over to the Eagles.

06:28.840 --> 06:34.000
As you know, we don't usually
accept students in the middle of the year,

06:34.080 --> 06:38.160
but Aspen was originally accepted
into the Greenhouse last year, so welcome.

06:38.240 --> 06:39.240
Thank you.

06:39.320 --> 06:42.000
[Louis] So I know we've all
had a rough time recently.

06:42.600 --> 06:45.760
I think it's time we get back
to our normal Greenhouse routine.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.240
We've decided to have a pop quiz to see

06:47.320 --> 06:49.360
how much you've all
really learned so far this year.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.520
Uh, I'm awful at those.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.440
[whispering] Don't worry.
There's probably a twist.

06:53.520 --> 06:56.760
But there's a twist.
Each student will be asked one question.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.960
The goal is to put together
a streak of correct answers

06:59.040 --> 07:01.160
and the team with the longest streak
wins the challenge.

07:01.240 --> 07:02.520
See?

07:02.600 --> 07:04.280
No, this is worse.

07:04.360 --> 07:07.920
Not only will I fail but I'll bring
everybody down with me.

07:08.880 --> 07:10.920
The prize. Yes, Parker.

07:11.040 --> 07:13.360
[all laughing]

07:13.440 --> 07:15.280
The winning team gets a day off
at the beach tomorrow,

07:15.360 --> 07:16.600
with an all-you-can eat barbecue!

07:16.680 --> 07:19.080
[all cheering]

07:19.680 --> 07:21.240
I love California!

07:21.880 --> 07:23.040
[Louis] Uh, Aspen,

07:23.120 --> 07:25.120
we'll be testing material
you may have not learned yet,

07:25.200 --> 07:26.600
so you won't have to participate.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.920
Okay, everyone, so,
back to the clubhouse to prepare.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.120
Suzanne will be there shortly
to begin the quiz.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.520
Yeah! Let's do this, Eagles!

07:33.600 --> 07:37.520
[all cheering] Eagles! Eagles!

07:39.680 --> 07:41.400
[Aspen] Guys, we've got this.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.080
I just wanted you to know

07:45.160 --> 07:47.120
that I had no idea
she planned to give up London for me.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.320
[clicks tongue]
Well, isn't she full of surprises?

07:55.800 --> 07:58.720
Excuse me, Mr. Osmond?
Headmaster Osmond? Sir?

07:58.800 --> 08:00.000
Louis is fine.

08:00.840 --> 08:03.640
I wanted to call Emma.
Do you have her phone number?

08:03.720 --> 08:07.680
Um... Yeah, um,
stop by my office after the challenge

08:07.760 --> 08:09.360
and I'll help you get in touch with her.

08:09.440 --> 08:12.400
Oh, wow. Awesome!
Thank you, sir. Headmaster. Louis.

08:20.960 --> 08:21.960
What did Max want?

08:22.640 --> 08:24.640
Oh, poor boy's missing Emma.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.400
He's a good kid.

08:35.799 --> 08:37.280
Y equals... Good. You got this, okay?

08:37.360 --> 08:40.120
Hey. Let me know if you need help
with that next problem.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.640
Hey, Tracy. Hey, you need help with that?

08:42.720 --> 08:44.760
I swear, I hate linear algebra!

08:44.840 --> 08:48.440
I mean, why can't I remember this formula
for slope-intercept form?

08:48.520 --> 08:50.320
[whispers] I'll be right back, okay.

08:50.400 --> 08:54.000
[in normal voice] Hey, relax.
You got this.

08:54.640 --> 08:56.040
Look.

08:57.520 --> 09:01.680
The formula is y = mx + b.

09:01.760 --> 09:06.680
So the problem is y = 5x + 3.
Can you graph it?

09:08.200 --> 09:10.400
[sighs]

09:10.480 --> 09:16.280
So 5x equals... that?

09:17.600 --> 09:19.320
That's what I'm saying.

09:19.400 --> 09:21.680
I mean, who uses this stuff
in real life anyway?

09:22.800 --> 09:24.440
It's five over one.

09:25.560 --> 09:27.160
What?

09:29.680 --> 09:32.640
Hey. Stand up.
Come on, I want to show you something.

09:32.720 --> 09:36.040
Hey, Tony. Thanks.

09:38.920 --> 09:41.840
Stay with me on this, all right?
Think fast.

09:41.920 --> 09:44.440
Okay. You're standing at center court.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.600
Now dribble the ball
three steps towards me.

09:46.680 --> 09:48.640
I'm the y intercept of three.

09:50.120 --> 09:53.480
Okay. One, two, three.

09:54.400 --> 09:58.800
Good. Now you're gonna walk five steps
forward and one step to the right.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.320
Okay.

10:01.400 --> 10:07.560
So, one, two, three, four, five.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.280
-Then to the right?
-[Sophie] Yeah.

10:10.200 --> 10:13.720
Cool. Stop right there.
Now you're at point B. Okay?

10:13.800 --> 10:17.840
So if you connect point B,
which is you, to me...

10:19.280 --> 10:22.080
Then y = 5x + 3.

10:22.160 --> 10:25.360
-Exactly. Yes!
-Hey, that's not bad.

10:25.440 --> 10:28.320
-You got it. Good.
-Give me some. Thank you.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.640
[chuckles] Of course. Good job.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.400
[chuckling]

10:38.840 --> 10:41.760
Come on, guys,
you're gonna give me whiplash.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.280
First you're together,
then you're at each other's throats.

10:43.360 --> 10:45.880
And now this cuteness?
I can't keep up.

10:45.960 --> 10:49.680
-We were meant to be.
-She says that all the time.

10:49.760 --> 10:52.800
Because it's true, Daniel.
We were meant to be.

10:55.560 --> 10:58.480
Mmm. Okay, that's weird. [scoffs]

11:03.960 --> 11:06.160
Are they testing us on the entire book?

11:06.240 --> 11:09.600
-It could be anything.
-It's 300 pages!

11:09.680 --> 11:12.000
Actually, it's 314 plus the appendix.

11:14.120 --> 11:15.720
Some of it's just pictures though.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.680
All right, listen up. I've got the list
of subjects for the quiz.

11:18.760 --> 11:21.320
-"Linear algebra--"
-"Linear algebra, chapters one to three,

11:21.400 --> 11:23.560
leadership,
American presidents before Lincoln,

11:23.640 --> 11:25.920
computer science, intro to Java,

11:26.000 --> 11:27.840
psychology, learning and motivation,

11:27.920 --> 11:30.480
-art history..."
-I am so screwed.

11:30.560 --> 11:32.440
Don't stress. You'll be fine.

11:32.520 --> 11:35.360
Guys? Can I have your attention, please?
Thank you.

11:35.440 --> 11:39.120
Why is she reading the instructions?
She's not even participating.

11:39.200 --> 11:42.440
Actually, I am.
I don't want any special treatment.

11:44.280 --> 11:47.040
Ravens, put away your books
and gather around.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.200
This challenge has begun.

11:51.080 --> 11:53.360
Okay, Ravens, listen up.

11:53.440 --> 11:56.000
Each student will be
asked a question in turn.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.600
You are not allowed to help each other.

11:58.680 --> 12:00.760
The Eagles are being asked
the exact same questions.

12:00.840 --> 12:03.240
Aspen, are you sure
you want to participate?

12:03.320 --> 12:04.400
Positive.

12:04.480 --> 12:07.760
Okay. Leo, we'll start with you.

12:10.360 --> 12:15.240
Which member of George Washington's
cabinet died after a duel?

12:16.880 --> 12:17.880
Alexander Hamilton.

12:17.960 --> 12:20.160
-That's correct.
-[all cheering]

12:23.120 --> 12:25.760
Okay, I know this.
It's, uh...

12:27.320 --> 12:28.400
Hamilton?

12:29.680 --> 12:32.120
-Yes.
-[all cheering]

12:32.960 --> 12:34.240
[Suzanne] Okay!

12:35.520 --> 12:36.680
Okay, Aspen.

12:36.760 --> 12:40.880
What style of painting was
developed by Georges Seurat?

12:40.960 --> 12:44.280
[scoffs] I hope you're not going
easy on me because I just got here.

12:44.360 --> 12:48.000
Anyway, the answer is clearly pointillism.

12:48.080 --> 12:49.960
-That's correct.
-Do you know,

12:50.040 --> 12:52.120
there is actually
a lovely jubbly painting of his

12:52.200 --> 12:55.600
over at the National Gallery
at Trafalgar Square. It is breathtaking.

12:57.440 --> 13:00.040
Okay... Becca. [chuckles softly]

13:00.120 --> 13:05.160
Daniel. Which performing artist is known
as the King of Rock 'n' Roll?

13:06.480 --> 13:09.120
Why didn't I get this?
I love Michael Jackson.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.400
-Elvis Presley.
-Elvis Presley.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.400
-That's correct.
-Yes. [cheering]

13:13.480 --> 13:15.080
See, I knew that one.

13:15.160 --> 13:17.480
[mouthing] What?

13:17.560 --> 13:20.920
All right. Parker,
I have a math question for you.

13:22.440 --> 13:23.440
Great.

13:25.400 --> 13:30.040
This is a graph.
I want you tell me what the equation is.

13:30.120 --> 13:31.720
[sighs]

13:31.800 --> 13:33.840
Psst. You got this.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.640
Okay.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.800
[indistinct conversation]

13:46.440 --> 13:47.800
Is everything all right, Parker?

13:49.480 --> 13:52.760
-Bro, you okay?
-[whispering] He's fine.

13:58.760 --> 14:03.840
Y = 6x + 9.

14:05.760 --> 14:06.760
That's correct.

14:06.840 --> 14:08.400
[all cheering]

14:08.480 --> 14:11.120
-[Daniel] That's what I'm talking about!
-[Parker] I knew I had it!

14:11.200 --> 14:13.760
[softly] You see?
I told you you could do it.

14:14.600 --> 14:15.680
Good job.

14:15.760 --> 14:19.760
Who was the first African-American player
to join Major League Baseball?

14:20.720 --> 14:24.800
Well, I don't watch baseball,
or any of the sports.

14:25.680 --> 14:29.560
Oh! Uh, I remember this
from our civil rights history course.

14:29.640 --> 14:31.400
Yes! Uh, Jackie Robinson.

14:31.480 --> 14:33.160
-Jackie Robinson.
-That's correct.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.840
[all cheering]

14:34.920 --> 14:37.480
[all cheering]

14:37.560 --> 14:40.160
And now over to our Jackie.

14:42.080 --> 14:47.760
Jackie, what do you call a two-dimensional
array made up of numbers or letters?

14:58.440 --> 15:01.720
I think the answer is a matrix.

15:02.320 --> 15:03.840
Good job, Alex.

15:03.920 --> 15:06.000
-Yes!
-[all cheering]

15:08.920 --> 15:11.720
-Focus, Jackie.
-Leave her alone, you're distracting her!

15:11.800 --> 15:13.480
I'm just trying to help.

15:13.560 --> 15:14.560
[Suzanne] Jackie?

15:17.920 --> 15:20.240
There's a movie trilogy
named after the answer.

15:20.320 --> 15:24.800
You are not allowed to help,
or you'll disqualify the whole team.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.680
Back to the Future?

15:27.760 --> 15:30.200
I'm sorry, Jackie. It was a matrix.

15:30.280 --> 15:32.640
Ravens, you're back to zero points.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.040
It's not your fault, she threw you off.

15:36.120 --> 15:41.080
Hayley, you're up next.
Who composed this famous piece?

15:41.160 --> 15:48.120
-["Hallelujah Chorus" playing]
-♪ ...lelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah ♪

15:48.200 --> 15:50.400
Suzanne, this challenge is ridiculous!

15:50.480 --> 15:52.240
You're just creating tension
between all of us.

15:52.320 --> 15:55.640
The strength of your team relies
on the abilities of its individuals.

15:55.720 --> 15:58.480
Too bad we can't pick
the individuals in our own team.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.400
What about the question I asked you?

16:00.480 --> 16:01.720
It's Handel.

16:01.800 --> 16:06.200
George Frideric Handel.
Born German, then became British.

16:06.280 --> 16:07.480
That's right.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.640
[all applauding]

16:14.440 --> 16:15.440
Judy.

16:15.520 --> 16:16.480
-Hmm?
-Come here.

16:18.440 --> 16:19.560
Look at this.

16:20.360 --> 16:23.280
Tectonic subductions are finally active.

16:24.360 --> 16:29.360
So we've reached the threshold.
Good. How soon can we start?

16:30.040 --> 16:34.640
Pretty soon. I still have to calibrate
the drag coefficient of the magnetite.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.880
That could take at least 72 hours.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.640
How's 24?

16:39.720 --> 16:43.160
You want to start tomorrow?
That's impossible.

16:43.240 --> 16:45.640
Nothing's impossible for you, Marcus.

16:45.720 --> 16:48.760
I'll let the client know that
we'll be ready for the trial run.

16:53.120 --> 16:56.600
Ravens, you have twelve in a row.
Max, it's now your turn.

16:56.680 --> 17:00.360
Maybe we should move Jackie to another
seat so she doesn't ruin our streak.

17:00.440 --> 17:02.600
-She's right.
-How dare you insult her like that?

17:02.680 --> 17:05.760
What did they teach you in that
school in London? How to be rude?

17:05.839 --> 17:07.079
I bet you aced that class.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.200
Guys, let's try and focus, okay?

17:10.000 --> 17:11.720
-[Suzanne] Okay, Max.
-[sighs]

17:11.800 --> 17:15.839
What do you call a geometric entity
with magnitude and direction?

17:15.920 --> 17:18.240
Hey, we just learned this in math class.

17:21.839 --> 17:22.839
I'm drawing a blank.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.520
Come on, even I can get this!

17:27.599 --> 17:30.360
Isosceles triangle?

17:32.560 --> 17:34.160
Is that your answer?

17:34.240 --> 17:35.280
Yes.

17:36.920 --> 17:38.600
I'm sorry, Max. It was a vector.

17:38.680 --> 17:44.600
Of course! Vector!
How could I forget that?

17:47.160 --> 17:48.800
[whispering] Now there's
no pressure on you.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.760
The release of Sgt. Pepper
was in 1967.

17:52.840 --> 17:56.000
-That's correct!
-[all cheering]

17:56.080 --> 17:58.880
All right, Brooke,
you ready for some American lit?

17:58.960 --> 18:02.720
-Yes! It's your favorite subject!
-Yeah. [chuckling]

18:02.800 --> 18:05.720
Which novel ends with the line,

18:05.800 --> 18:11.600
"So we beat on, boats against the current,
borne back ceaselessly into the past"?

18:13.640 --> 18:18.440
We haven't studied American literature yet
at my old school.

18:21.240 --> 18:24.960
-What was that line again?
-"Ceaselessly into the past."

18:25.040 --> 18:27.240
The past, right.

18:29.280 --> 18:31.680
Bloody hell, I have no idea.

18:31.760 --> 18:35.960
Um, maybe we should move Aspen
so she doesn't ruin our streak.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.880
Tom Sawyer? Moby Dick?

18:38.960 --> 18:41.200
You're just guessing. I can't accept that.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.280
Um... [panting]

18:43.360 --> 18:45.400
I have no idea!

18:46.760 --> 18:51.560
I'm so sorry. I am such an idiot!
I have... I have no idea.

18:52.880 --> 18:57.120
[gasping] Oh, my gosh. Sorry!

18:58.240 --> 19:03.040
"Boats against the current.
Boats against the current."

19:03.120 --> 19:04.600
Come on, I know you know this!

19:04.680 --> 19:07.920
Sophie, one more word
and I'll disqualify the entire team.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.280
-Okay, fine. Sorry.
-[indistinct chatter]

19:10.360 --> 19:13.560
[clears throat] Um, I mean...

19:15.440 --> 19:18.400
I don't know. I can't remember.

19:18.480 --> 19:21.800
Well, the answer is The Great Gatsby.

19:21.880 --> 19:25.920
-[clicks tongue] Oh, man.
-Great. Great. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, guys.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.600
Dude, we talked about this
last Friday at lunch!

19:28.680 --> 19:31.800
-You told me the book made you cry.
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.560
[crying] I will never
forgive myself for this!

19:41.640 --> 19:45.360
I single-handedly destroyed
this entire challenge!

19:47.480 --> 19:49.480
You didn't know an answer
to a question, Aspen.

19:49.560 --> 19:50.840
That's all that happened.

19:51.600 --> 19:55.280
Unbelievable. I mean, this girl always
has to be the center of attention.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.680
[continues crying]

19:56.760 --> 19:58.840
I feel sorry for her.

19:58.920 --> 20:02.080
What? Are you serious?
After the way she treated you?

20:03.040 --> 20:05.560
I know how it feels to ruin everything.

20:11.440 --> 20:13.000
[sniffling]

20:14.080 --> 20:18.840
It's not your fault. It's just a game.
And you did your best.

20:24.080 --> 20:25.080
[Leo] It's okay.

20:27.720 --> 20:30.760
Eagles. Ravens.

20:30.840 --> 20:34.320
Congratulations on an exciting challenge.
The results were very close.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.560
The difference between your two teams
was one answer.

20:37.640 --> 20:39.480
[scoffs] Naturally.

20:39.560 --> 20:42.400
Eagles, you had 11
correct answers in a row.

20:42.480 --> 20:45.480
[Eagles cheering]

20:47.440 --> 20:51.680
And Ravens, you had 12 correct answers
in a row. You won by one answer!

20:51.760 --> 20:54.480
[Ravens cheering]

20:55.320 --> 20:57.000
-[Leo] We won!
-[chuckling]

21:02.840 --> 21:05.520
It's on me, guys. Sorry.

21:18.280 --> 21:22.120
Max, what you did for me...

21:23.120 --> 21:24.200
You're a true friend.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.480
Max, this is Emma's number.

21:29.560 --> 21:32.920
When you call her,
please give her our love.

21:36.040 --> 21:38.280
Well, what are you waiting for?

21:38.360 --> 21:40.280
[chuckles]

21:42.280 --> 21:44.000
[sighs]

21:44.080 --> 21:46.720
Hey. Um...

21:46.800 --> 21:50.000
I wanted to apologize
for how I was acting before.

21:51.320 --> 21:55.320
Sometimes I can be a bit... careless.

21:56.800 --> 22:00.440
It's okay.
I can be like that, too, sometimes.

22:34.320 --> 22:35.600
[line ringing]

22:35.720 --> 22:39.000
-[Emma on phone] Hello?
-Hi, Emma? It's me, Max.

22:40.280 --> 22:43.840
So, we didn't get a chance to talk
before you left in such a hurry.

22:45.040 --> 22:48.040
-[Emma] I know.
-[Max] So, how's your mom?

22:48.120 --> 22:51.720
[Emma] Good. I mean, not really.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.000
Emma, you sound weird. Is everything okay?

22:54.080 --> 22:56.840
-I'm sorry, Max, I have to go.
-What, no, wait...

22:56.920 --> 22:57.920
[line disconnects]

23:05.800 --> 23:06.800
[cell phone chimes]

23:10.560 --> 23:12.840
Here's the encrypted IP address.

23:18.920 --> 23:20.680
[line ringing]

23:20.760 --> 23:22.240
[man on phone] Well?

23:22.320 --> 23:23.400
We're ready to go.

23:25.640 --> 23:28.040
-[man] When?
-Tomorrow.

23:28.120 --> 23:30.440
[man] And our tracks are covered, yes?

23:30.520 --> 23:33.560
The only satellite that could have
traced us is no longer functioning.

23:34.840 --> 23:37.400
-We're ready.
-Good.

23:37.480 --> 23:41.200
So, Judy, when will
our earthquake take place?
