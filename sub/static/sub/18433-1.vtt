01:09.000 --> 01:12.276
- What's the charge, sister?
- Half a dollar a dance.

01:12.360 --> 01:14.476
- You mean them women are countesses?
- Some are.

01:14.560 --> 01:17.757
No kiddin'.
Give me five bucks worth.

01:19.960 --> 01:21.791
Thank you, sir.

01:24.680 --> 01:27.797
- I got a ticket to dance with a countess.
- Go to it, buddy.

01:27.880 --> 01:31.634
Want to tell the folks back home
I'm movin' in high society.

01:32.720 --> 01:35.280
- Oh, pardon me. Can I sit down?
- Please.

01:35.360 --> 01:39.399
I've got a ticket to dance.
You a countess?

01:41.320 --> 01:43.629
No kiddin'!

01:43.720 --> 01:46.359
<i>Tell me, how many countesses
are there around here?</i>

01:46.440 --> 01:49.830
Oh, quite a few.

03:15.360 --> 03:19.672
Every statesman, every minister
and diplomat should dedicate himself...

03:19.760 --> 03:22.433
<i>to the cause of world peace.</i>

03:22.520 --> 03:26.229
<i>Ogden, it's Harvey!
Ogden, are you still at that speech?</i>

03:26.320 --> 03:29.756
Here we are, China, Hong Kong,
and you're still trying to save the world.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.877
Let's get out of here. See the town.
We're only staying 24 hours.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.791
All right, Crawford.
We'll finish this after lunch.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.713
Okay, sir.

03:37.800 --> 03:42.112
Can ya believe it? Hong Kong.
By golly, I can see a Chinaman.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.077
I wouldn't be at all surprised.

03:44.160 --> 03:47.948
Look at them.
Packed together like sardines.

03:48.040 --> 03:50.873
That's what I dislike about
the poor. They have no taste.

03:50.960 --> 03:54.191
They indulge in squalor. They pick
the worst neighbourhoods to live in...

03:54.280 --> 03:57.317
eat the worst kind of food
and dress atrociously.

03:57.400 --> 04:00.790
That's the first time I've seen you
smile since we've been on this trip.

04:00.880 --> 04:03.599
That wasn't a smile.
That was a gas pain.

04:03.680 --> 04:06.035
<i>How do you feel, buddy?</i>

04:06.120 --> 04:09.396
- Depressed.
- You should be the happiest man in the world.

04:09.480 --> 04:13.996
Six weeks you'll be divorced,
and possibly the next Secretary of State.

04:14.080 --> 04:16.719
<i>- We'll wait and see.
- Here's the day's paper.</i>

04:16.800 --> 04:20.952
"Ogden Mears, multimillionaire,
son of the richest oilman in the world...

04:21.040 --> 04:24.191
will be the new
Secretary of State. "

04:24.280 --> 04:26.635
Let me see that.

04:26.720 --> 04:31.396
You didn't finish the sentence.
"According to the latest rumour. "

04:31.480 --> 04:34.677
"Son of the richest oilman in the world. "
They won't let you forget it.

04:34.760 --> 04:37.877
That's the burden you must carry.

04:37.960 --> 04:41.396
Harvey, you're a corrupting influence.

04:41.480 --> 04:44.916
Maybe, but I didn't lead you
into politics.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.070
- What else is there to do?
- Murder, arson, rape.

04:47.160 --> 04:49.390
<i>There's plenty of worthy occupations.</i>

04:49.480 --> 04:53.109
<i>- Crawford, sir.
- Come in, Crawford.</i>

04:53.200 --> 04:56.749
Just came over the wire. The President
has appointed Mr Patrick Dowling...

04:56.840 --> 05:01.152
- Secretary of State.
- Dowling, huh? Well, that's show business.

05:01.240 --> 05:04.710
<i>- Who the devil is Patrick Dowling?
- Secretary of State.</i>

05:04.800 --> 05:08.509
- I'll check for more news.
- Thank you, Crawford.

05:08.600 --> 05:12.388
<i>Harvey, I guess you're right. I think
I'll give up trying to save the world.</i>

05:12.480 --> 05:15.870
Tonight we're gonna celebrate
Patrick Dowling's appointment.

05:15.960 --> 05:20.556
Excuse me, sir.
Mr Clark has telephoned.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.312
Mr Clark? Where is he?

05:22.400 --> 05:24.595
Up in the lounge.
He says he's on his way down.

05:24.680 --> 05:27.240
<i>- Show him here.
- Yes, sir.</i>

05:29.160 --> 05:32.232
- Who's Clark?
- He's one of Father's senior directors.

05:32.320 --> 05:34.151
A venerable old gentleman.

05:34.240 --> 05:36.754
We don't want to get stuck with that
old boy for the rest of the evening.

05:36.840 --> 05:38.717
No, I'll get rid of him.

05:38.800 --> 05:42.190
Remember you just got over the flu. Took
a long sea voyage to get away from it all.

05:42.280 --> 05:46.717
<i>- We don't want to be visiting parks and museums.
- Mr Clark, sir.</i>

05:46.800 --> 05:50.839
Ogden, my dear boy, I haven't seen you
since you were in swaddling clothes.

05:50.920 --> 05:53.798
I must say you're
the replica of your father.

05:53.880 --> 05:57.714
Uh, Mr Clark, may I present
my friend Harvey Crothers?

05:57.800 --> 06:00.951
How do you do? I beg
your pardon. Well, sir.

06:01.040 --> 06:04.112
Hudson tells me you're under the weather
and here I am ready to show you the town.

06:04.200 --> 06:07.476
Unfortunately, this is my first day up
after... the flu.

06:07.560 --> 06:10.791
I think perhaps I better stay
inside and just take things easy.

06:10.880 --> 06:14.668
Of course, my dear boy.
I'll not disturb you.

06:14.760 --> 06:17.354
<i>But before I go, I'd like to introduce
some very dear friends of mine.</i>

06:17.440 --> 06:19.271
<i>They're waiting in the lounge.</i>

06:19.360 --> 06:24.036
Well, certainly. Hudson, would you show
Mr Clark's friends in?

06:24.120 --> 06:27.510
<i>- They're alone in the lounge. You can't miss them.
- Yes, sir.</i>

06:28.000 --> 06:32.710
Well, Ogden, too bad you're not up to scratch.
I was looking forward to showing you around.

06:32.800 --> 06:36.270
Yes, well, I'm disappointed. I was
reading about it and it sounds fascinating.

06:36.360 --> 06:40.672
- The botanical gardens and museums...
- Oh, dear me, dear me.

06:40.760 --> 06:44.958
Botanical gardens? Ha, ha, ha!
I think we can do better than that.

06:57.120 --> 06:59.680
I guess I've been
reading the wrong book.

06:59.760 --> 07:02.069
Ogden, these are my friends.

07:02.160 --> 07:05.277
<i>This is Mr Ogden Mears...</i>

07:05.360 --> 07:07.828
<i>Mr Harvey Crothers.</i>

07:07.920 --> 07:10.559
<i>Countess Chiedoff...</i>

07:10.640 --> 07:13.996
<i>Countess Natascha Alexandrov...</i>

07:14.080 --> 07:16.913
<i>Baroness Cavanotchy.</i>

07:17.000 --> 07:19.036
Hello, I'd like a drink.

07:19.120 --> 07:21.509
No, no, Baroness.
It's too early.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.431
Excuse me.
What will you have, ladies?

07:23.520 --> 07:26.193
- Champagne.
- Champagne, champagne.

07:30.680 --> 07:33.717
No, no, don't turn it off.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.314
Music complements
the champagne.

07:36.400 --> 07:39.631
<i>Ladies, would you be seated?</i>

07:51.800 --> 07:53.870
Too bad you're just
getting over the flu, Ogden.

07:53.960 --> 07:57.669
I thought we might go on somewhere
this evening and take the ladies along.

07:57.760 --> 08:00.194
But then the night air
might be dangerous for you.

08:00.280 --> 08:04.114
Oh, I think if I wrap up well
it'll be all right.

08:17.200 --> 08:19.077
Where are the girls?

08:19.160 --> 08:22.197
I don't know. I think they went to the
ladies room as soon as you left.

08:22.280 --> 08:24.874
I must have inspired them
with the same idea.

08:24.960 --> 08:28.748
Let me tell you about
these ladies. Harvey.

08:28.840 --> 08:31.798
They are the daughters
of Russian aristocrats.

08:31.880 --> 08:34.347
Their titles are absolutely genuine.

08:34.440 --> 08:37.477
Their parents escaped to Shanghai
during the Russian Revolution.

08:37.559 --> 08:41.394
Shanghai was a nasty place
in those days.

08:41.480 --> 08:45.439
An international settlement
run by seven nations.

08:45.520 --> 08:48.592
Because they had no country,
their life was worthless.

08:48.680 --> 08:52.753
<i>They could be robbed, murdered.
Nobody bothered.</i>

08:52.840 --> 08:55.991
Countess Natascha,
the one sitting next to you...

08:56.080 --> 08:58.469
<i>has had rather a sad life.</i>

08:58.560 --> 09:01.552
<i>She was the mistress
of a gangster at the age of 14.</i>

09:01.640 --> 09:04.552
How did the others
manage to live?

09:04.640 --> 09:08.030
Many starved,
others committed suicide.

09:08.120 --> 09:10.680
Some of the women
worked in dance halls.

09:10.760 --> 09:14.719
The men had to compete with the cheapest
labour because they couldn't leave the country.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.908
I think Harvey
is very good-looking.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.434
A lot of good that'll do you.
He's penniless.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.273
So what? Haven't you
any romance in your soul?

09:27.360 --> 09:29.749
Money makes me romantic.

09:29.840 --> 09:31.956
I thought Harvey
was the one with the dough.

09:32.040 --> 09:36.909
You have poor instincts, my dear. It's the
other one, Ogden Mears, who has the money.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.551
He's the son of the richest oilman in
the world, and Natascha's got him hooked.

09:41.640 --> 09:44.313
Mr Ogden?
He's very attractive.

09:44.400 --> 09:49.349
Hmph. Leave it to Natascha. She's like
a divining stick finding water.

09:49.440 --> 09:51.829
Only in her case,
she's found oil.

09:51.920 --> 09:55.037
Well, you can have
your big oilman.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.156
He's here today
and gone tomorrow.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.435
But I shall stick to old Papa Clark.

09:59.520 --> 10:02.990
He took me away
from the dance halls.

10:17.280 --> 10:20.750
Listen, Milton...
Pardon me, Mr Milton Clark.

10:20.840 --> 10:23.434
Would you like to dance?

10:23.520 --> 10:25.511
Natascha.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.355
You're very quiet this evening.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.557
Am I? I'm sorry.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.995
Don't apologize.
I like quiet people.

10:47.080 --> 10:50.152
They're either clever or dull.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.708
I would say you're
one of the clever ones.

10:52.800 --> 10:56.270
Thank you.
I'd better keep silent.

10:56.360 --> 10:59.830
Well, whatever you do,
it's very attractive.

10:59.920 --> 11:04.869
- Would you like to dance?
- No. I'd like to sit here and talk with you.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.997
- I regret I speak English so badly.
- You speak it beautifully.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.311
I understand
you were born in Shanghai.

11:12.400 --> 11:15.631
Yes. But my parents
came from Russia.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.676
<i>And now they've moved
to Hong Kong?</i>

11:17.760 --> 11:20.638
My parents died in Shanghai
when I was 13.

11:20.720 --> 11:25.236
- Haven't you any brothers or sisters?
- I was an only child.

11:25.320 --> 11:29.279
Thirteen, a little young
to face the world.

11:29.360 --> 11:32.238
We must all face it
sooner or later.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.788
Some more sooner.

11:34.880 --> 11:37.394
How did you come
to live in Hong Kong?

11:37.480 --> 11:42.235
Well, there was another war,
another revolution. So here we are.

11:42.320 --> 11:47.155
- But let us talk of something more cheerful.
- I'm sorry.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.674
- Would you like to dance?
- I'd love to.

12:11.560 --> 12:15.599
Congratulations, Your Excellency. You
are now a Plenipotentiary Extraordinary.

12:15.680 --> 12:19.116
Will you ring for the steward
and have him bring some ice water?

12:19.200 --> 12:21.430
Oh.

12:23.360 --> 12:26.557
What's this
Plenni-pli-plen-what?

12:26.640 --> 12:28.756
Just came over the radio.
You've been appointed...

12:28.840 --> 12:32.310
Plenipotentiary Extraordinary
to the Court of Saudi Arabia.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.231
I'll never get away
from the oil business.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.038
You been sleeping
on that couch all night?

12:36.120 --> 12:38.190
What's this?
Telephone numbers.

12:38.280 --> 12:40.475
Some of your first
official appointments, I guess.

12:40.560 --> 12:44.109
- And this?
- Some roughneck guy got fresh with Natascha...

12:44.200 --> 12:46.873
<i>- in a nightclub and you clipped him.
- I clipped him?</i>

12:46.960 --> 12:51.750
A brawl in a nightclub? Well, I'm off
to a fine start as Ambassador.

12:51.840 --> 12:56.277
- Steward, sir. - Would you bring
me some Alka-Seltzer and ice water?

12:56.360 --> 12:59.033
Yes, sir.

12:59.120 --> 13:02.112
- Who's Natascha?
- You don't know Natascha?

13:02.200 --> 13:04.475
You ought to. You were pretty
clubby with her last night.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.516
- What do you mean "clubby"?
- From the verb "club. "

13:06.600 --> 13:08.795
To form an association
united by a common interest.

13:08.880 --> 13:13.237
- I don't want to hear any more. Where are we?
- Way out at sea.

13:13.320 --> 13:16.073
- When did we leave Hong Kong?
- Two hours ago.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.993
<i>- That's the first call for lunch.
Coming down?</i>

13:19.080 --> 13:22.675
No, I'm gonna take a bath
and get myself together.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.320
- I'll call ya later then.
- Yeah.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.909
Uh, Hudson.

13:48.800 --> 13:51.189
Just fixing your bath, sir.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.714
What are you doing, Hudson?

14:17.800 --> 14:22.112
- Just making a note of the telephone numbers.
- Don't bother with them.

14:37.480 --> 14:39.710
- Oh!
- I beg your pardon.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.831
Did I startle you?

14:44.920 --> 14:47.718
- Who are you?
- I'm Natascha.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.075
Oh, well, how do you do?

14:50.160 --> 14:53.596
- Are we alone?
- I don't know. Maybe there's somebody under the bed.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.716
I'm sorry.

14:55.800 --> 14:58.473
What are you doing
in that closet?

14:58.560 --> 15:02.189
<i>- Well, sir, if you'll allow me, I'll explain everything.
- Go ahead.</i>

15:02.280 --> 15:04.874
I don't know whether you remember
the Baroness, the Countess and me?

15:04.960 --> 15:06.439
Get to the point.

15:06.520 --> 15:10.035
<i>- After leaving the Pantheon, we finally finished up here.
- And then?</i>

15:10.120 --> 15:13.556
Then you fell asleep, so everyone left,
but I came back to look for my handbag.

15:13.640 --> 15:15.756
Enough of that.
Why are you hiding in that closet?

15:15.840 --> 15:17.637
I've stowed away.

15:17.720 --> 15:20.678
<i>- You what?
- I'm going to America.</i>

15:20.760 --> 15:24.150
- Are you crazy?
- Please don't get excited.

15:24.240 --> 15:26.629
If you let me stay until the purser's
checked all the passengers...

15:26.720 --> 15:28.915
I'll leave your cabin
and will never bother you again.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.118
<i>- If anyone comes, I can hide
in the bathroom or closet.</i>

15:39.320 --> 15:41.880
<i>- Who is it?
- Hudson, sir, with the menu...</i>

15:41.960 --> 15:44.872
<i>in case you should want lunch
before the kitchens close.</i>

15:44.960 --> 15:47.520
Thank you.
Call later, Hudson.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.111
You see how simple it is.

15:58.200 --> 16:02.637
After the purser's checked everyone, no one
will know whether I'm a passenger or not.

16:03.480 --> 16:07.598
Now look, the best thing for you to do is go
straight to the Captain and tell him what happened.

16:07.680 --> 16:10.353
You were visiting friends
and you were left aboard.

16:10.440 --> 16:13.398
But isn't it awkward if he wants
to know where I slept all night?

16:13.480 --> 16:17.393
Of course not! What do you mean?
Tell him the truth.

16:17.480 --> 16:20.233
<i>There's nothing to hide.</i>

16:26.000 --> 16:29.356
<i>- Who is it?
- Alka-Seltzer, sir.</i>

16:33.800 --> 16:35.677
Thank you, sir.

16:41.840 --> 16:45.992
- Look, I must take my bath and get dressed now.
- Yes, of course.

16:48.400 --> 16:50.356
Do you mind leaving?

16:50.440 --> 16:53.512
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I can wait in the next room.

16:53.600 --> 16:57.593
<i>You don't seem to understand. You cannot
wait in this suite. I have friends coming.</i>

16:57.680 --> 17:00.114
- But where can I go?
- That's your problem.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.760
- Please let me stay until the purser's checked everyone.
- No, no.

17:02.840 --> 17:04.910
I promise. After tonight,
you'll never see me again.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.830
You'll have to leave
these premises immediately.

17:06.920 --> 17:09.559
I can't leave dressed like this
in the middle of the day.

17:09.640 --> 17:12.915
- However, you can't stay here.
- I must!

17:13.000 --> 17:15.116
Well, if you insist,
I shall have to ring for the purser.

17:15.200 --> 17:20.797
If you do, I'll scream, tear my clothes
and swear you tried to attack me.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.348
- This is blackmail.
- Yes, blackmail.

17:26.440 --> 17:30.228
- Oh, no, I didn't mean it. That was a stupid thing to say.
- Certainly was.

17:30.320 --> 17:33.596
Of course it isn't blackmail. I don't want
your money. I want to get away from Hong Kong.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.752
- I tried to tell you that last night...
- You've told me enough.

17:36.840 --> 17:38.671
You wouldn't let me explain.

17:38.760 --> 17:41.558
- I'm gonna give you one more chance. Are you going to leave this cabin?
- No.

17:41.640 --> 17:44.234
- If you ring the bell, I'll scream.
- We'll see about that.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.151
- Please, I never meant it.
- Stand away from that bell.

17:46.240 --> 17:48.993
- No, I won't.
- Then I'll ring from the next room.

17:49.080 --> 17:50.911
Oh!

17:51.000 --> 17:54.549
Please, please, I beg you!

17:54.640 --> 17:57.029
Now go ahead and scream.

18:22.760 --> 18:24.990
Where is that steward?

18:32.200 --> 18:35.431
- Steward, would you please send for the purser?
- Yes, sir.

18:35.520 --> 18:37.351
Thank you.

18:39.440 --> 18:41.795
Don't bother. I'll go.

18:41.880 --> 18:44.075
Well, I'm sorry,
but if I succumb to sympathy...

18:44.160 --> 18:47.391
I'd have the whole world
on my neck.

18:47.480 --> 18:52.679
Now, if it's just a question of paying your
fare to wherever you want to go, I'll do that.

18:52.760 --> 18:55.957
But you have to get off
at the next stop.

18:56.040 --> 18:59.271
- It's no use. That's Japan. They'll arrest me.
- Why?

18:59.360 --> 19:02.079
<i>- I haven't a passport.
- You haven't a passport?</i>

19:02.160 --> 19:04.310
How do you expect to land
in the United States?

19:04.400 --> 19:09.030
<i>- I'll get in some way.
- My dear young lady, you haven't a chance.</i>

19:09.120 --> 19:12.237
The best thing for you to do
is return to Hong Kong.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.390
Never.

19:14.480 --> 19:17.313
I'll talk to the purser and see
if we can get you a cabin.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.231
<i>Who is it?</i>

19:19.320 --> 19:22.995
<i>- The purser, Your Excellency.
- Oh.</i>

19:23.080 --> 19:25.435
- Here, in...
- Oh, yeah.

19:29.200 --> 19:32.033
Good afternoon, Your Excellency.

19:32.120 --> 19:36.079
Good afternoon, purser. I'd like to know
if you have an extra berth or cabin.

19:36.160 --> 19:39.357
I'm sorry, sir. We haven't a thing.
We're completely full up.

19:39.440 --> 19:41.874
<i>There might be something
at Kobi, but I doubt it.</i>

19:41.960 --> 19:44.793
- When do we get to Kobi?
- Tomorrow morning at 11.00, sir.

19:44.880 --> 19:48.714
<i>- Thank you.
- Is there anything else I can do for Your Excellency?</i>

19:48.800 --> 19:50.791
No, not a thing. Thank you.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.311
Well, they're full up.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.595
- Full up?
- Yeah.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.671
We'll manage somehow.

20:19.760 --> 20:24.117
Will we? Where do you think
you're gonna sleep tonight?

20:24.200 --> 20:26.873
As soon as it's dark,
I can sleep in one of the lifeboats.

20:26.960 --> 20:30.430
Whatever made you think
you could get away with this?

20:30.520 --> 20:34.832
I didn't think. It was an impulse.
A chance to escape.

20:34.920 --> 20:37.309
Escape? Escape from what?
Have you committed a crime?

20:37.400 --> 20:40.995
Of course not. Escape from despair,
hopelessness, no future.

20:41.080 --> 20:44.516
Nothing to look forward to
but dance halls and prostitution.

20:44.600 --> 20:47.160
But I am determined
not to slowly die and rot.

20:47.240 --> 20:49.231
Well, that's no excuse for your actions.

20:49.320 --> 20:51.754
There's no excuse
for many things in this world.

20:51.840 --> 20:53.956
You're getting off at Kobi,
the next stop.

20:54.040 --> 20:57.953
- Then I can stay?
- Stay? I can't get rid of ya.

20:58.040 --> 21:01.430
Now do you mind going
in the other room while I take a bath?

21:01.520 --> 21:03.590
Not at all, Your Excellency.

21:03.680 --> 21:06.240
- If anyone knocks, don't answer.
- No, Your Excellency.

21:06.320 --> 21:10.029
- Lay off the "Excellency. "
- Yes, sir.

21:19.560 --> 21:21.596
What are you going to do
about food?

21:21.680 --> 21:24.433
It's no hardship to miss
a meal occasionally.

21:24.520 --> 21:28.069
- You want me to break down and weep?
- No, but...

21:28.160 --> 21:32.790
Well, then, mark down what you want
on the menu while I lock the door.

21:44.680 --> 21:47.478
Now, when you hear a knock like this,
you'll know it's me.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.991
<i>It's Crawford.</i>

21:58.480 --> 22:00.436
Come in, Crawford.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.476
Harvey says not to wait
for him for lunch.

22:02.560 --> 22:04.790
He's not feeling too well.
I think he's got an upset stomach.

22:04.880 --> 22:06.711
I've got a little
upset stomach myself.

22:06.800 --> 22:10.190
Excuse me, sir. The kitchens
will be closed in ten minutes.

22:10.280 --> 22:13.033
Oh, here it is.

22:14.440 --> 22:17.398
"Chicken a la king,
potato au gratin, string beans...

22:17.480 --> 22:21.189
"cauliflower, a glass of milk
and caramel ice cream...

22:21.280 --> 22:23.589
with hot chocolate sauce," sir?

22:23.680 --> 22:26.035
That's about it.

22:26.120 --> 22:28.918
Oh, no, sir. It's not bad
for an upset stomach.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.589
<i>Ogden.</i>

24:06.560 --> 24:10.439
Oh, excuse me.

24:16.160 --> 24:17.957
Why don't you go to bed?

24:18.040 --> 24:20.190
I thought I'd wait for you.

24:20.280 --> 24:23.477
Oh, that is, I don't know where to go.

24:23.560 --> 24:26.199
You'd better run along
to your lifeboat.

24:26.280 --> 24:29.795
<i>It's no laughing matter.</i>

24:29.880 --> 24:32.269
However, you can sleep
in the next room.

24:32.360 --> 24:36.353
- Where are you going to sleep?
- That's my business.

24:36.440 --> 24:40.433
There's another bed in the other room,
if you'd care to sleep there.

24:40.520 --> 24:43.398
Thank you. I'm sleeping on the sofa.

25:08.760 --> 25:11.752
I suppose you have
nothing to sleep in.

25:11.840 --> 25:13.876
Oh, don't bother.

25:22.680 --> 25:26.275
- Here, you can use these and this.
- Thank you.

25:26.360 --> 25:29.432
I'm sorry I don't have
any hairpins or toothbrush.

25:29.520 --> 25:32.990
I feel terrible putting you
to all this trouble.

25:33.080 --> 25:38.313
Hmm. You can write me to that effect
when you're off this boat.

26:14.160 --> 26:16.754
Come in.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.198
Ogden, you mustn't.

26:55.640 --> 27:00.475
Please don't turn the radio down.
Keep it up. Keep it up.

27:00.560 --> 27:03.632
Sorry.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.191
Get up out of there.

27:30.280 --> 27:33.352
Oh, I wish you'd let me sleep here.
I feel I'm robbing you of your bed.

27:33.440 --> 27:35.271
You're robbing me of my sleep.

27:35.360 --> 27:38.830
Look. I'm very comfortable here.

27:38.920 --> 27:41.878
<i>Oh! Ah!</i>

27:44.520 --> 27:47.080
<i>- Mr Ogden, are you asleep?
- Yes. What is it?</i>

27:47.160 --> 27:49.515
<i>It's Crawford. Harvey's been in bed
all day with an upset stomach.</i>

27:49.600 --> 27:53.354
<i>- Can ya give him something?
- Just a minute.</i>

28:00.200 --> 28:03.158
- Tell him to take this. He'll feel 100% in the morning.
- Thanks.

28:03.240 --> 28:05.390
- Goodnight, Crawford.
- Goodnight, boss.

28:21.080 --> 28:23.833
Now, you get in the other room
and stay there.

28:23.920 --> 28:26.354
Be careful.
These pyjamas are transparent.

28:26.440 --> 28:30.752
- So are you.
- Goodnight.

28:52.520 --> 28:54.397
Come in.

28:58.280 --> 29:00.714
I believe this is yours.

29:03.120 --> 29:05.270
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.151
Up, come on, get up.
We're gonna be in Kobi in 15 minutes.

29:44.240 --> 29:47.835
<i>Yes, sir, I'll tidy up first.</i>

30:16.680 --> 30:19.035
- Now, what are you going to have for breakfast?
- Oh, anything, sir.

30:19.120 --> 30:22.715
Two boiled eggs... four minutes...
a little bacon, toast and coffee.

30:22.800 --> 30:25.234
Eggs, bacon, toast and coffee.

30:25.320 --> 30:28.278
- Oh, and hot milk to go with the coffee.
- Hot milk.

30:28.360 --> 30:31.477
- Oh, yes, and marmalade.
- And marmalade.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.915
Boiled eggs.
I suppose they're fresh?

30:34.000 --> 30:37.231
I don't know about the eggs.

30:44.520 --> 30:47.080
<i>Who is it?</i>

30:47.160 --> 30:50.357
<i>Steward, sir.</i>

30:50.440 --> 30:53.989
- Good morning, sir. Breakfast?
- Yes.

30:55.400 --> 30:58.039
"Two eggs, bacon, toast and coffee,
hot milk, marmalade. "

30:58.120 --> 30:59.997
<i>That all, sir?</i>

31:00.080 --> 31:03.311
- Yes, and would you serve it in the next room, please?
- Very good, sir.

31:06.920 --> 31:09.195
- What were you doing?
- The bath was overflowing.

31:09.280 --> 31:12.829
<i>So I turned the taps off.</i>

31:18.440 --> 31:20.795
Good morning, boss. I just came
to tell you a batch of reporters...

31:20.880 --> 31:23.155
got on with the pilot and they're
waiting now to interview you.

31:23.240 --> 31:25.993
Morning, Ogden. A batch
of reporters got on with the pilot.

31:26.080 --> 31:29.117
- They're waiting to interview you.
- I can't see anybody before breakfast.

31:29.200 --> 31:31.395
Say about 11.00?
They're in the lounge.

31:31.480 --> 31:34.074
I can keep them busy for a while,
but it might be a good idea...

31:34.160 --> 31:37.072
to bring them here and give them a drink
and sandwich to sweeten them up.

31:37.160 --> 31:40.118
All right, you fix that up.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.998
Harvey, I'll see you after breakfast.
I have to collect myself.

31:43.080 --> 31:46.356
- Oh, how do you feel?
- Oh, great. The stuff you gave me fixed me up...

31:46.440 --> 31:48.749
Good. Fine.
I'll see you after breakfast.

31:48.840 --> 31:51.070
R- Right after breakfast.

32:10.160 --> 32:12.037
What... What
do you want, Hudson?

32:12.120 --> 32:16.113
- To prepare your bath, sir.
- I've had my bath.

32:18.280 --> 32:20.350
<i>Just a moment.</i>

32:20.440 --> 32:23.238
May I have the key,
if you don't mind?

32:30.600 --> 32:33.637
- It's Ogden.
- I beg your pardon, Your Excellency.

32:48.880 --> 32:50.916
- Is that all, sir?
- Yes, that's all.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.831
Thank you, sir.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.550
It's Ogden. Hurry up.

33:01.640 --> 33:03.870
- This door is broken.
- I know.

33:03.960 --> 33:07.157
- Hurry up and eat your breakfast.
- Yes, Your Excellency.

33:09.520 --> 33:14.196
Oh! Like a silver garden.

33:14.280 --> 33:16.350
How lovely.

33:16.440 --> 33:19.079
- Hurry up and eat!
- Oh! Yes, sir.

33:21.800 --> 33:25.679
I ordered boiled eggs and they've
scrambled them, but it doesn't matter.

33:25.760 --> 33:28.558
Will you please hurry up? We're gonna
be in Kobi in just a few minutes now.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.790
I'm doing my best, sir.

33:30.880 --> 33:32.916
You should have been up
and dressed an hour ago.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.355
But I haven't got
any clothes to wear.

33:35.440 --> 33:37.476
What? Y-You have
a dress in there!

33:37.560 --> 33:40.632
That's for the evening. I can't appear at
11.00 in the morning in an evening dress.

33:40.720 --> 33:43.632
You should have thought
about that before.

33:43.720 --> 33:47.395
Wait. There's a dress shop at the top
of the stairs. Ladies dress shop.

33:47.480 --> 33:49.311
- What are your measurements?
- Hmm?

33:49.400 --> 33:51.231
- How tall are you?
- Five foot 7.

33:51.320 --> 33:54.630
What about around here?

33:54.720 --> 33:57.393
Never mind that.
What about here?

33:57.480 --> 33:59.914
- Modesty forbids.
- Oh!

34:00.000 --> 34:04.471
Now, listen. Remember when I leave,
lock both doors.

34:19.480 --> 34:21.311
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

34:21.400 --> 34:24.277
I'd like to have a lady's suit
for someone about 5 feet 7.

34:24.360 --> 34:26.237
I'm afraid we've nothing in stock.

34:26.320 --> 34:29.755
- What's all this?
- Samples, sir. Our main stores are in London and New York.

34:29.840 --> 34:33.628
I'll take anything you have.
A complete lady's outfit will be fine.

34:33.719 --> 34:35.551
Yes, sir.

34:57.640 --> 35:00.712
<i>Ogden!</i>

35:04.240 --> 35:06.151
Here. Here's some clothes.

35:06.240 --> 35:10.472
Hurry up and get dressed. The press
is going to be here in five minutes.

35:10.560 --> 35:12.391
Yes, sir.

35:28.240 --> 35:30.959
- Aren't you ready yet?
- I'm trying to get ready, sir, but...

35:31.040 --> 35:33.838
You are not trying to get ready.
I've had just about enough of this.

35:33.920 --> 35:36.354
- I'm not gonna stand...
- I gave you my measurements, but...

35:36.440 --> 35:38.715
Listen, I'm not interested in
the problem off your measurements.

35:38.800 --> 35:42.156
- I'm interested in you getting out this door right now.
- What is this for?

35:42.240 --> 35:44.356
<i>- If you're not off this boat
in two minutes...</i>

35:48.120 --> 35:50.918
<i>- Who is it?
- Steward, sir.</i>

35:51.000 --> 35:53.150
- Yes, sir?
- Clear these things away.

35:53.240 --> 35:55.993
Yes, sir.

36:14.560 --> 36:17.996
- Aren't you ready yet?
- But it's all too big!

36:18.080 --> 36:21.277
- Haven't they got something smaller?
- That's the smallest they have.

36:21.360 --> 36:24.716
- What am I to do?
- "Do"? Get dressed and get off the boat!

36:24.800 --> 36:28.873
It's absurd. I can't go ashore like
this. I'd be arrested. They don't fit.

36:28.960 --> 36:30.837
Then you'll go as you are.

36:30.920 --> 36:34.037
In your pyjamas?

36:34.120 --> 36:38.033
- Take off those pyjamas.
- Would that look nice?

36:38.120 --> 36:40.588
Take off those pyjamas
or I'll tear them off.

36:40.680 --> 36:42.910
- Oh!
- You heard what I said.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.117
- Take 'em off.
- Oh, please, my nerves.

36:46.200 --> 36:48.475
- Take them off.
- Oh, this is silly.

36:48.560 --> 36:51.393
- You'll see how silly this is.
- Oh!

36:51.480 --> 36:53.311
Ah!

36:57.080 --> 36:59.116
Take 'em off.

36:59.200 --> 37:02.237
Oh, please. Do you want me
to call the Captain?

37:02.320 --> 37:05.471
Oh, but really.
What are we doing?

37:05.560 --> 37:07.391
Ooh! Ooh! Oh, dear!

37:09.320 --> 37:11.754
You'll get off this boat if I...

37:11.840 --> 37:13.831
<i>Who is it?</i>

37:13.920 --> 37:16.434
<i>It's Crawford, sir.</i>

37:17.920 --> 37:20.832
Come in, ladies and gentlemen.
Please be seated.

37:20.920 --> 37:23.150
- How do you do?
- Good morning.

37:23.240 --> 37:26.118
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

37:40.400 --> 37:44.552
Ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce
His Excellency, Ogden Mears?

37:44.640 --> 37:47.950
- How do you do?
- Good morning. How many in your party, Mr Mears?

37:48.040 --> 37:51.157
There are three of us,
Mr Crothers, Mr Crawford and myself.

37:51.240 --> 37:55.313
- I understand you've been made Ambassador to Saudi Arabia.
- Yes, that's right.

37:55.400 --> 37:57.550
Are you going
directly there now?

37:57.640 --> 38:00.757
No, I'll go to Washington
for the usual formalities.

38:00.840 --> 38:04.549
- Is your wife going with you?
- I hope so.

38:04.640 --> 38:07.279
<i>Mr Ambassador,
what is your solution for peace?</i>

38:07.360 --> 38:12.115
The solution for peace
lies in man himself.

38:12.200 --> 38:15.749
<i>In this atomic age
and the power of military might...</i>

38:15.840 --> 38:18.434
- Wait, I'll get you a towel.
- Liberty, freedom and justice...

38:18.520 --> 38:23.275
are generalities that have been
quoted as an excuse for aggression.

38:23.360 --> 38:27.353
<i>- Ah!
- Nature has given us...</i>

38:27.440 --> 38:30.193
<i>the, uh, technological ability to...</i>

38:30.280 --> 38:33.989
...military might, but is built
on the foundation of peace...

38:34.080 --> 38:37.311
and goodwill to all men.

38:37.400 --> 38:41.393
In this atomic age,
only the morality of man...

38:41.480 --> 38:44.392
can help him to survive.

38:44.480 --> 38:46.835
The solution for peace is in truth...

38:46.920 --> 38:50.276
and tolerance and understanding.

38:50.360 --> 38:53.432
<i>- Thank you, gentlemen.
That will be all, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

38:53.520 --> 38:56.592
<i>Refreshments over here, please.
- Ogden, I've got to talk to you.</i>

38:56.680 --> 38:58.511
- Not now, old man.
- But, Ogden!

38:58.600 --> 39:00.431
I'm sorry. I need rest.
I'm going back to bed.

39:00.520 --> 39:05.640
Are you kidding? A dame
in your bathroom. I went to get a towel.

39:05.720 --> 39:09.315
I'll talk to you about that later
on the Promenade Deck.

39:13.280 --> 39:16.158
She says she's a stowaway
and she's going to America.

39:16.240 --> 39:19.118
How did she get
into your pyjamas?

39:19.200 --> 39:23.512
Like a fool, I loaned her a pair
of my pyjamas to sleep in.

39:25.520 --> 39:28.034
Well, you'll have to pay her off.

39:28.120 --> 39:31.317
I offered to pay her expenses back
to Hong Kong, but she won't take it.

39:31.400 --> 39:33.834
That's peanuts.
She's out for big dough.

39:33.920 --> 39:35.956
Why don't you get off the boat
and leave her flat?

39:38.840 --> 39:40.671
Too late.

39:40.760 --> 39:43.354
I've gotta do something.
I just can't leave her...

39:43.440 --> 39:46.159
downstairs in that cabin
with my pyjamas.

39:46.240 --> 39:50.153
It puts me in a terrible spot.
What am I gonna do?

39:50.240 --> 39:54.711
All right. Let's go to lunch
and afterwards you let me talk to her.

40:21.800 --> 40:25.076
Mr Mears.

40:25.160 --> 40:27.594
- Oh!
- That's all right. This is Mr Crothers.

40:27.680 --> 40:29.557
You met him this morning
in the bathroom, I believe.

40:29.640 --> 40:33.076
- How do you do?
- Well, I see you've been playing chess.

40:33.160 --> 40:35.958
- Alone?
- Yes.

40:36.040 --> 40:38.679
I took the liberty of putting on
another pair of your pyjamas...

40:38.760 --> 40:41.228
after the other one
had been ripped off.

40:41.320 --> 40:45.598
- Where's the torn one?
- I hid it. I didn't think you wanted anyone to see it.

40:45.680 --> 40:48.990
- You think I give a damn who sees it?
- You spoilt my move.

40:49.080 --> 40:53.232
Now, now, Ogden. Let's settle
this thing without any bitterness.

40:53.320 --> 40:58.394
Natascha, I understand
you want to go to America.

40:58.480 --> 41:00.436
- Yes.
- Good.

41:00.520 --> 41:04.115
Now, Ogden tells me you have
neither a passport nor a visa.

41:04.200 --> 41:07.397
- I don't need them.
- What makes you think you don't need them?

41:07.480 --> 41:10.074
- Because I haven't got them.
- Fair enough.

41:10.160 --> 41:13.072
- See, she's insane.
- Because I haven't a passport?

41:13.160 --> 41:15.958
What's the use
of arguing with her?

41:16.040 --> 41:18.270
Don't you realize
that you'll be caught?

41:18.360 --> 41:20.191
I have no intention
of being caught.

41:20.280 --> 41:23.158
- But you have to pass the Immigration officers.
- So what?

41:30.840 --> 41:33.718
<i>- Who is it?
- Chief Steward, sir.</i>

41:33.800 --> 41:37.031
Excuse me. Do you mind
closing all your port-holes, sir?

41:37.120 --> 41:39.475
Yes, it seems to be
blowing up out there.

41:39.560 --> 41:41.949
Just a little sloppy. Nothing serious.

41:42.040 --> 41:43.871
Yes.

41:46.120 --> 41:47.951
All clear.

41:51.400 --> 41:55.188
- What are you hiding for?
- Me? I don't know.

41:55.280 --> 41:58.431
However, let's get down to business.

42:04.040 --> 42:07.635
Natascha, I like you.

42:07.720 --> 42:09.551
<i>And I think
I'm a good judge of character.</i>

42:09.640 --> 42:13.792
You mustn't mind Ogden.
He's a little abrupt, but he means well.

42:13.880 --> 42:18.510
<i>Well, you mean well, but he hasn't
approached you in the right way.</i>

42:18.600 --> 42:20.556
I'm sure you don't
want to ruin his career.

42:20.640 --> 42:22.835
All I want is to get to America.

42:22.920 --> 42:26.435
Well, that can be arranged, if you'll
get off at Tokyo and take another boat.

42:36.640 --> 42:40.519
If you get off at Tokyo,
I'll give you $25,000.

42:40.600 --> 42:42.989
You don't seem to understand.
I don't want money.

42:43.080 --> 42:45.230
This is a trick and you're
not getting away with it.

42:45.320 --> 42:47.834
Natascha, how much
do you want?

42:47.920 --> 42:52.072
- I don't want money.
- And I don't want this.

42:52.160 --> 42:54.833
- We'll give you $50,000.
- There's no use in arguing.

42:54.920 --> 42:57.718
Best thing to do is go to the Captain
and tell him the whole story.

42:57.800 --> 43:01.110
Then I'll tell him my side. How you
kidnapped me, locked me in your cabin...

43:01.200 --> 43:04.158
and after attacking me,
tried to get rid of me.

43:04.240 --> 43:08.119
Do you think I give
a hoot for your threats?

43:10.120 --> 43:14.352
Now, wait a minute.
This is getting us nowhere.

43:14.440 --> 43:17.716
Ogden, you can catch
more flies with honey...

43:17.800 --> 43:20.439
than you can with...

43:20.520 --> 43:22.988
With what?

43:23.080 --> 43:25.719
<i>Well, I'd say mustard or vinegar.</i>

43:26.840 --> 43:29.149
Mustard and vinegar?

43:29.240 --> 43:32.835
What's that got to do with it?

43:36.400 --> 43:40.518
Well, you can get more
with honey. Honey, huh.

43:40.600 --> 43:43.990
Now, listen, "Natischa. "
If Ogden goes to the Captain...

43:44.080 --> 43:48.517
he'll believe him before he'll believe
you, and you'll be sent to jail.

43:48.600 --> 43:53.754
If you'll get off the boat at Tokyo
without a scandal, we'll give you $ 75,000.

43:53.840 --> 43:57.549
I don't want money.

43:57.640 --> 44:00.712
Ogden, you're dealing
with an odd character.

44:00.800 --> 44:05.078
This is a hold-up.
I'm going straight to the Captain.

44:05.160 --> 44:07.754
Don't do anything rash, Ogden.

44:11.880 --> 44:13.757
Ogden?

44:15.560 --> 44:19.235
<i>Ogden, before you do anything...</i>

44:39.440 --> 44:41.635
<i>Out!</i>

44:43.400 --> 44:48.030
What do you think
you're doing? Oh.

44:51.560 --> 44:54.199
Harvey, ring for some ice water.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.037
You leave this cabin immediately.

45:48.360 --> 45:50.715
- Well, good morning, Ogden.
- Hello, Harv.

45:50.800 --> 45:52.950
- How do you feel?
- Wonderful.

45:53.040 --> 45:56.112
Good. Say, you had
quite a siege of it.

45:56.200 --> 45:58.430
For a while there,
I thought it was serious.

45:58.520 --> 46:01.273
It was a touch of the old malaria.
I get it every once in a while.

46:01.360 --> 46:03.920
- But now I feel great.
- Good.

46:04.000 --> 46:09.279
- Say, uh, how's the situation down below?
- I don't know what to think.

46:09.360 --> 46:12.238
She stayed up two days and nights
dosing me with quinine...

46:12.320 --> 46:14.675
and taking my temperature.

46:14.760 --> 46:17.797
She wanted to send for the ship's doctor
when she thought it was serious.

46:17.880 --> 46:19.711
Of course I stopped her.

46:19.800 --> 46:23.588
<i>Three days we arrive in Honolulu,
then she says she'll disappear.</i>

46:23.680 --> 46:28.151
- I'll miss her.
- So will I.

46:28.240 --> 46:32.199
I'll miss the tension,
the excitement of it all.

46:44.920 --> 46:47.036
We were wondering
what had become of you.

46:47.120 --> 46:49.714
- Well, I...
- I hope you haven't been seasick.

46:49.800 --> 46:53.190
- Actually, it was quite something else.
- Everybody's been seasick.

46:53.280 --> 46:56.078
At least it'll give them
something to talk about at dinner.

46:56.160 --> 46:58.435
How sick they were,
what they ate.

46:58.520 --> 47:02.195
Daddy says it's surprising what people will
talk about to make themselves interesting.

47:18.600 --> 47:21.592
- I can't do that.
- Oh, yes, you can.

47:21.680 --> 47:25.514
I'll show you.
There. Isn't it wonderful?

47:25.600 --> 47:29.991
I think dancing
stimulates conversation.

47:30.080 --> 47:35.200
Wasn't it Aristotle who used to walk and
lecture around the Lyceum and talk of the soul?

47:35.280 --> 47:39.034
Though Daddy says he never had
a clear idea of what the soul is.

47:39.120 --> 47:43.477
But Daddy has.
He says the soul is desire.

47:43.560 --> 47:45.915
And that the whole of life is desire.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.116
I think it's a wonderful idea.

47:48.200 --> 47:50.873
Well, if you can't shimmy,
we'll just dance ordinary.

47:55.640 --> 47:59.315
Do you believe
in the immortality of the soul?

47:59.400 --> 48:02.198
- Well...
- Daddy does. He believes that when we die...

48:02.280 --> 48:05.955
our souls go on until they're
reborn again through love.

48:06.040 --> 48:08.429
- Love?
- You don't believe in love?

48:08.520 --> 48:10.670
- Well, I...
- Daddy does.

48:10.760 --> 48:15.151
He loves everybody,
except the Communists.

48:15.240 --> 48:18.312
- You're in the Diplomatic Service, aren't you?
- Yes.

48:18.400 --> 48:22.313
How boring it must be
to be diplomatic to everyone.

48:22.400 --> 48:25.437
- But you're Ambassador to Arabia, aren't you?
- Yes, I...

48:25.520 --> 48:27.954
- Have you been there before?
- Oh, yes.

48:28.040 --> 48:31.953
- Do tell me about it. I adore Arabs.
- Well, the Arabs are very inter...

48:32.040 --> 48:36.397
Quite a crowd tonight. You'd never suspect
that most of them have been seasick.

48:36.480 --> 48:40.393
One passenger has been confined
to her cabin ever since we left Hong Kong.

48:40.480 --> 48:43.199
Her empty chair is next to mine
in the dining room.

48:43.280 --> 48:48.115
I'm so intrigued to see
what she looks like.

48:50.600 --> 48:53.398
<i>It's Harvey!</i>

48:56.400 --> 48:58.834
Peek-a-boo.

48:58.920 --> 49:01.388
Well, I-I see you're
enjoying yourself.

49:01.480 --> 49:04.995
I thought I'd come see that you
weren't getting into any mischief.

49:05.080 --> 49:08.311
- Mischief?
- Well, it's a difficult situation.

49:08.400 --> 49:10.755
I'll be glad when it's over.

49:10.840 --> 49:14.913
- You really think you'll be able to land in the States?
- Oh, yes.

49:15.000 --> 49:19.152
I sincerely wish you all the luck
in the world. I know Ogden does.

49:19.240 --> 49:21.435
Ogden?

49:21.520 --> 49:24.637
Oh, yes, he...
He speaks very well of you.

49:24.720 --> 49:26.472
That's surprising.

49:26.560 --> 49:28.596
Well, it's all difficult.

49:28.680 --> 49:32.275
These close quarters. He's very
suspicious. You're very attractive.

49:32.360 --> 49:35.397
<i>That's what he's fighting against.</i>

49:35.480 --> 49:37.471
He seems to have won.

49:37.560 --> 49:39.949
Unfortunately,
it started out the wrong way.

49:40.040 --> 49:41.871
But he'll miss you.

49:41.960 --> 49:44.076
Hmm.

49:44.160 --> 49:46.469
Oh, yes. He said so himself.

49:46.560 --> 49:49.916
He'll be only too glad
to get rid of me.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.195
I don't know.

49:52.280 --> 49:55.272
- What's he doing upstairs?
- Dancing with some young blonde.

49:57.600 --> 50:00.353
- Is she pretty?
- Well, she's young.

50:01.840 --> 50:05.196
Hey, what are you doing?
You put the five in the wrong place.

50:10.400 --> 50:14.109
Electrician to fix the lights
in the sitting room and bedroom.

50:14.200 --> 50:17.988
- Could you come back in half an hour?
- Very well, sir.

50:18.080 --> 50:20.913
It's the electrician to fix the lights
here and in the bedroom.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.878
They've been here every ten minutes,
rapping on the door.

50:23.960 --> 50:27.635
- Now they have a passkey.
- I don't like that passkey business.

50:27.720 --> 50:30.234
I think you'd be safer upstairs dancing.

50:30.320 --> 50:35.713
- Ogden would be furious.
- Not when I tell him about the electrician with the passkey.

50:35.800 --> 50:38.439
Well, if I'm caught, it's better
to be upstairs than down here.

50:38.520 --> 50:42.957
Now that's the spirit! If you stay
down here, you'll go stir crazy.

51:09.080 --> 51:11.150
- You stay here. I'll find Ogden.
- Don't leave me alone!

51:11.240 --> 51:13.071
No. No. I'll only be a minute.

51:13.160 --> 51:16.550
- Excuse me. May I have this dance?
- Harvey!

51:16.640 --> 51:20.792
No, it's all right. How do you do?
I'll meet you back here.

51:31.080 --> 51:33.389
Why aren't you dancing, Captain?

51:33.480 --> 51:36.233
I was just about to ask
this very attractive young lady.

51:36.320 --> 51:40.472
You better be nice to him.
We're all under his control.

51:44.800 --> 51:48.873
I've been wondering about
the immortality of the soul.

51:54.080 --> 51:56.548
<i>Change your partners.</i>

52:03.240 --> 52:06.038
<i>Change your partners.</i>

52:10.880 --> 52:13.348
I don't think I've seen you
throughout the voyage.

52:13.440 --> 52:17.035
- Of course, you're the lady who's been confined to her cabin.
- Yes, yes.

52:17.120 --> 52:20.192
It's a pity you're such a poor sailor.
However, that's our misfortune.

52:26.920 --> 52:30.959
<i>- Change your partners.
- Thank you so much.</i>

52:40.560 --> 52:42.710
Why did you leave the room?

52:42.800 --> 52:45.837
The electricians wanted to fix the lights.
They have a passkey.

52:45.920 --> 52:47.990
- You mean they saw you?
- Of course not.

52:48.080 --> 52:51.038
- Harvey answered the door.
- What was he doing there?

52:51.120 --> 52:54.556
I'm lucky he was there.
Otherwise, they would have seen me.

52:54.640 --> 52:58.394
- What were you and the Captain talking about?
- He asked if I was enjoying the trip.

52:58.480 --> 53:01.552
- What did you tell him?
- I said every moment of it.

53:08.880 --> 53:11.235
<i>Change your partners.</i>

53:16.080 --> 53:19.993
Natascha! What are you
doing away from Hong Kong?

53:20.080 --> 53:22.674
- I'm going to San Francisco.
- Alone?

53:22.760 --> 53:26.389
- I'm looking for a job.
- You don't have to look far. I'll give you a job.

53:26.480 --> 53:29.756
Oh, no. I'm not looking
for that kind of work.

53:38.320 --> 53:41.630
Where have you been?
I haven't seen you around the whole trip.

53:41.720 --> 53:45.076
- I've been confined to my cabin.
- Hiding from someone?

53:45.160 --> 53:48.596
- I've been very sick.
- Where is your cabin?

53:48.680 --> 53:51.478
- None of your business.
- All right, I'll find out from the purser.

54:00.680 --> 54:04.309
- Let's go to the bar and have a drink.
- No, I'm very tired. I'm going to bed.

54:04.400 --> 54:06.231
- I'll go with you.
- No, you won't.

54:06.320 --> 54:09.118
- Then have a drink.
- I'm going straight to my cabin.

54:09.200 --> 54:14.672
You can't get rid of me. I'm either going
to your cabin or we're going to have a drink.

54:14.760 --> 54:16.796
I'll have a drink.

54:21.160 --> 54:24.277
- I told her to meet me here.
- Where are they?

54:24.360 --> 54:27.158
Oh, there they are at the bar.

54:27.240 --> 54:31.153
- I wonder what they're talking about.
- Let's go and listen.

54:50.120 --> 54:52.680
- Yes, sir.
- A martini.

54:52.760 --> 54:54.591
- And you?
- Beer.

54:55.720 --> 54:58.996
Hey, come on, honey,
where is your cabin?

54:59.080 --> 55:02.197
- Wouldn't you like to know?
- Come clean, honey. Don't play the virgin.

55:02.280 --> 55:04.111
Virgin? What's that?

55:04.200 --> 55:07.875
I see I'll have to teach you
the facts of life.

55:07.960 --> 55:11.236
Now, listen, honey, I...

55:18.200 --> 55:22.352
- Still playing hard to get?
- No, hard to please.

55:22.440 --> 55:25.432
What's wrong with me?
Have I got leprosy or something?

55:25.520 --> 55:27.351
Yes.

55:27.440 --> 55:30.750
Whether I have or not,
I'm going with you.

55:36.200 --> 55:39.476
They must be in the other corridor.
I'll go 'round, meet them face on.

55:39.560 --> 55:41.994
Okay.

55:42.080 --> 55:45.277
- Natascha, come on.
- Really, I must say goodnight.

55:45.360 --> 55:49.114
- Why the anticlimax?
- Hello, chum! How've you been?

55:49.200 --> 55:51.839
- Say, how's the wife?
- Who are you?

55:51.920 --> 55:54.992
Are you kidding? I'm the brother
of that guy who sold you the used Pontiac.

55:55.080 --> 55:57.594
- Let's have a drink.
- I don't know you.

55:57.680 --> 55:59.830
Of course you do. You've been talking
to my sister all night.

55:59.920 --> 56:02.150
- That's not your sister.
- It's not my uncle.

56:13.360 --> 56:15.237
<i>Ogden.</i>

56:26.480 --> 56:30.996
I hope you enjoyed yourself,
letting everybody know you were here.

56:31.080 --> 56:33.548
Flaunting and parading
around this ship.

56:33.640 --> 56:37.076
What are you trying to do?
Ruin my career, destroy me?

56:38.440 --> 56:41.557
I was beginning to
believe in you, trust you.

56:41.640 --> 56:44.438
I thought there was something decent,
something worthwhile.

56:44.520 --> 56:47.592
But you're just a common harlot.

56:53.840 --> 56:56.593
Dragging me into
your sordid intrigues.

56:56.680 --> 56:59.148
Leering into the face
of that stupid paramour of yours.

56:59.240 --> 57:01.708
Why don't you go hide
in his cabin?

57:01.800 --> 57:06.828
<i>- Why don't you torment him?
- I won't torment you any longer.</i>

57:06.920 --> 57:12.278
It has not been cheerful for me either
to endure your contempt every day.

57:12.360 --> 57:14.999
I thought I could take it, but I can't.

57:15.080 --> 57:16.911
You win.

57:23.800 --> 57:27.713
No. No, I won't.

57:27.800 --> 57:30.075
You're crazy.

57:33.240 --> 57:35.708
Maybe.

57:39.160 --> 57:42.914
- Where you going?
- To the purser and give myself up.

57:43.000 --> 57:47.073
Oh, don't worry. I'll keep your
spotless reputation out of it.

57:47.160 --> 57:49.799
I'll tell him I've been hiding
in second class.

57:49.880 --> 57:52.155
Why this sudden change
in attitude?

57:53.200 --> 57:57.432
- Why yours?
- You know why.

58:14.040 --> 58:18.272
Good morning, purser. Could you tell
me the cabin number of Miss Natascha...

58:18.360 --> 58:20.749
I don't know her other name,
but I know her quite well.

58:20.840 --> 58:23.229
- Perhaps you mean Miss Gaulswallow.
- Who?

58:23.320 --> 58:25.436
Gaulswallow.

58:25.520 --> 58:28.318
- Yeah, I guess so.
- I don't think she wants to be disturbed.

58:28.400 --> 58:31.039
Okay, but I'd like to
send her some flowers.

58:40.760 --> 58:44.116
Flowers for Miss Gaulswallow.

58:46.360 --> 58:49.033
Oh, dear, dear.
I don't know him.

58:50.680 --> 58:54.559
Take them away.
They take up all the oxygen.

58:54.640 --> 58:58.155
They take up all the oxygen.

59:00.120 --> 59:03.032
Anna Pooh, my old friend.

59:03.120 --> 59:05.270
Oh, that red tongue!

59:05.360 --> 59:07.237
Nurse!

59:07.320 --> 59:09.595
Take my Russian friend away.

59:09.680 --> 59:13.116
He's too big
and I don't like his red tongue.

59:13.200 --> 59:16.670
Ohh, ohh, more colours.

59:18.280 --> 59:20.919
Oh, not that.
No more of that.

59:21.000 --> 59:24.310
I don't like the green either.
Put that right away.

59:24.400 --> 59:27.153
Ooh! How awful.

59:27.240 --> 59:29.356
In the drawer, please.

59:31.560 --> 59:34.518
Give me the chocolates.

59:36.520 --> 59:38.351
The Captain, madam.

59:38.440 --> 59:40.590
Well, I... I...

59:40.680 --> 59:44.912
Captain!
Oh, how nice of you.

59:46.280 --> 59:48.840
Chocolates.

59:48.920 --> 59:51.798
Oh, how perfectly charming.

59:51.880 --> 59:56.271
Nurse, will you
put these by the port-hole?

59:56.360 --> 59:59.477
<i>Just the sort of thing
my nephews will enjoy.</i>

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:03.275
Nurse!
My thermometer.

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:08.438
Give it to me.
I'll shake the thing myself.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.833
Nurse, where's
my thermometer?

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:24.993
I've lost my thermometer.
Or did I swallow it?

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:30.428
<i>Come in!</i>

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:40.029
What was that?
Something flew in and then flew out.

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:44.159
Must have been a bat.

01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:00.432
The man that looked after you since
you were 14, was he a White Russian?

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:02.351
Yes.

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:06.110
Was he married?

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.998
Yes. Separated from his wife.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.639
He was a desperate man.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:17.235
They say he was a gangster,
but he was very kind to me.

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:20.198
God knows what I would have
done without him.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:22.396
Did you love him?

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.516
I was too young.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:26.431
How old was he?

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:30.713
Sixty-three when he died.

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:37.511
What's the matter?

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.431
Me? Nothing.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:45.393
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:50.031
At 10.00 I have to look for Crawford
and send some cablegrams.

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.031
You look worried.

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:56.318
I'm just wondering
how you're going to land in the States.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:58.277
Please don't worry about it.

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:02.194
You have to be realistic.
In two days, you're going to be in Hawaii.

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:07.274
Yes, I'm getting off there. It will be
easier getting into the States that way.

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:11.956
- Suppose you get into trouble.
- Whatever happens, you won't be involved.

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:16.477
You have to be realistic, face facts.
What are your plans?

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:19.996
I can supply you with money,
but supposing you do get into trouble?

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:24.073
- I'd like to be of some help.
- Please don't feel obligated.

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:27.948
The moment we arrive in Honolulu,
I shall have vanished.

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:31.271
You're so remote, so alone.

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.191
That's what saddens me.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:38.634
Don't be sad. That's too easy.

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.551
Be like me.

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:46.551
- At this moment, I'm very happy.
- This moment.

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:49.359
That's all we can ask for.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.271
This moment.

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.999
There'll be many moments.

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.196
I wonder.

01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:59.111
<i>Of course.</i>

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:03.552
Our lives are so different,
so far apart.

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:06.393
No need to be, if we're discreet.

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:12.192
I hate to leave, but it's 10.00
and I have to send those cablegrams.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.309
Oh. Don't worry.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:20.029
I want to help, and I can.
But I must know your plans.

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:24.796
And meanwhile, don't vanish.
We still have two more days.

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.916
<i>I won't.</i>

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:51.075
<i>It's Harvey.</i>

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.631
Good morning.

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:03.029
I just met your boyfriend
who pursued you last night.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:05.680
He's still roaming the boat,
looking for your room number.

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:11.151
<i>Am I intruding?</i>

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:15.916
Two more days.

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:20.438
Yep. I could see it coming.

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.829
Both of you falling in love.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.668
I don't know about Ogden...

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:29.479
but this is a new experience for me.

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:32.950
Well, it happens in the best
of regulated families.

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:37.557
I don't want to fall in love.

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.757
<i>I think he's very fond of you.</i>

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:47.153
However, if you ever got into trouble,
his friendship could be very useful.

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.800
Oh, it's all so hopeless.

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:51.916
I don't agree.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:56.317
Well, in two days, it will be over.

01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:01.150
<i>- You're leaving at Honolulu?
- Yes.</i>

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:05.392
- Have you thought about what you're going to do?
- I have a plan.

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.596
Well, it better be a good one.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.111
Harvey?

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:14.033
If I tell you, promise me
you won't tell Ogden.

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:18.238
- Why?
- He's very conservative. He might object.

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:21.357
- What are you going to do?
- Dive off the boat.

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.716
Oh, honey, where did you get that idea?
You'll break your neck!

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:28.395
Oh, no, no. In Hawaii, they come
in little boats and dive for money.

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:31.597
Some climb aboard
and dive off the boat. I can do that.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:34.319
Why do stars shine so bright

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:37.358
Why does the nightingale
sing at night

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:41.353
Because they believe in love

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:04.159
Why should I look and sigh

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:08.791
How fortunate that
my chair's next to yours.

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:11.997
- I believe in love
- I'll turn this off.

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:14.435
Now we can talk.

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:19.999
I'm interrupting your reading.
How inconsiderate of me.

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:23.834
Nothing's more annoying than to have
someone interrupt your reading.

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:28.311
Daddy says it's a lack
of consideration for other people.

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:31.312
Where's your friend, the Ambassador?

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:35.029
He seems to have erased himself
completely during the voyage.

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:39.193
Daddy says that people who erase
themselves have a profound shyness...

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:42.875
which really means that they're
afraid of exposing themselves.

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:44.837
Hmm.

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:48.593
Oh, the silence is frightening.

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:50.910
Would you like some more music?

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:57.990
Mrs Martha Mears,
wife of Ambassador Ogden Mears...

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.958
<i>will await her husband's arrival
in Honolulu this evening.</i>

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:03.156
<i>Rumours have been rife that
the Ambassador and his wife...</i>

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:05.071
<i>are getting a divorce.</i>

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:09.392
<i>Nevertheless, Mrs Mears says she will
accompany her husband to Washington.</i>

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:12.916
- He's getting a divorce!
- Excuse me.

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:21.716
Your wife's waiting for you in Honolulu.
It just came over the radio.

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.950
I know. I just got a telegram.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.838
She's coming aboard this evening
and she's not getting a divorce.

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:28.751
What about Natascha?

01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:30.671
That's the problem.

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:33.228
You've got to think fast.
We arrive at 9.30.

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:36.790
- You've got to get her out of your cabin!
- Where's she gonna go?

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:39.792
- She can sleep in my cabin.
- That's out.

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:44.431
You didn't let me finish.

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:46.750
I could double in
with Crawford or Hudson.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:49.718
Crawford and Hudson
are staying with two other fellows.

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:54.032
- You can't let her stay where she is.
- Obviously not.

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:57.317
I've got it. You can say
she's married to Hudson.

01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:01.552
- Hudson?
- Say, that's an idea. If she was married to an American citizen...

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:04.598
she could get into the States
without any trouble.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:15.429
- You wish to see me, sir?
- Yes, Hudson. Sit down.

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:17.350
Thank you, sir.

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:21.551
- Would you like a drink?
- Uh, no, thank you, sir.

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:24.438
Uh, Hudson, you are
an American citizen, aren't you?

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:27.956
I've been an American citizen
for the past 16 years, sir.

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:31.794
- Good. I want you to do me a favour.
- Yes, sir.

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:35.714
You remember that attractive lady
I was dancing with last night?

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:37.631
I do, sir.

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:40.075
<i>Well, I want you to marry her.</i>

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:44.158
- Marry who, sir?
- The lady I just mentioned.

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:47.357
It'll only be a temporary affair,
and afterwards, you can get a divorce.

01:08:47.439 --> 01:08:50.716
If I may say so, sir,
this is rather sudden.

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:54.948
I think I will take
a brandy after all, sir.

01:08:55.040 --> 01:09:00.238
I agree it's somewhat extemporaneous,
but it's a matter of urgency.

01:09:00.319 --> 01:09:02.629
If the lady is married to
an American citizen...

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:05.188
she'll have little trouble
getting into the States.

01:09:05.279 --> 01:09:07.999
And when does all this
happen, sir?

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.036
In about ten minutes.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.595
<i>- I still have to speak to the lady, of course.
- She doesn't know yet?</i>

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:19.036
Oh, no, not yet. But don't worry.
We're arranging that.

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:22.395
I think you should
be married before lunch.

01:09:22.479 --> 01:09:24.630
You will have a brandy?

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:26.596
Make it a double, if you please, sir.

01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:30.832
Double brandy, please.
I'll have the same. Thank you.

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:36.996
If I might ask a rather
connubial question, sir...

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:40.435
what happens this evening,
that is, tonight?

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:42.350
After the marriage.

01:09:42.439 --> 01:09:45.078
Oh, nothing that
concerns you, Hudson.

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:49.153
You'll be sleeping in the same room,
but in different beds.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:54.474
I think you should be
getting yourself ready.

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:57.996
I think you can wear an ordinary
lounge suit for the wedding.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:00.071
- Yes, sir.
- Fine.

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:04.711
And while you're getting dressed,
I'll talk to the lady.

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.677
Thank you.

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:17.677
What's this I hear?
I'm to marry Hudson?

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:20.558
- Well, it's an emergency.
- Yes, but Hudson!

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:23.757
It'll solve all our problems.
You'll be married to an American citizen.

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:27.753
You'll have little trouble getting into the
States, and afterwards you can get a divorce.

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:32.516
<i>I've got nothing to wear.
I can't get married in your pyjamas.</i>

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.636
<i>Harvey!</i>

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:37.837
It's all arranged. Captain'll
be down in a couple minutes.

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:41.356
- What did you tell him?
- I gave him a line about how her papers blew overboard.

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:44.238
She met Hudson, they fell in love.
Well, the Captain's on.

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:47.278
He understands the situation,
but it's gonna cost you dough.

01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:50.636
- How's the happy bride?
- I wish I were back in Hong Kong.

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:55.957
That's the Captain.

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:01.151
- How do you do, sir?
- How do you do?

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:05.028
This is to be kept
strictly confidential.

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:08.351
- I understand, Mr Mears.
- Mr Harvey has explained everything.

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:11.637
Good. I assure you
it will be deeply appreciated.

01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:16.032
<i>- We're only too pleased
to help out in such matters.</i>

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:18.918
<i>- Who is it?
- Hudson, sir.</i>

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:22.431
<i>- You're late.
- I'm sorry, sir.</i>

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:25.637
Captain, I'd like to present Hudson,
the, uh, bridegroom.

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:29.156
How do you do?
Now, where's the bride?

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:32.516
Oh, I believe
she's still dressing.

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:34.431
Are you ready?

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:39.879
Oh, the Captain.
It's all too big. Nothing fits! Look!

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:42.269
You're losing weight.
You've been dieting too much.

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:44.555
Let's get on with it.

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:47.916
Countess, bridegroom.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.878
Mr Harvey, you're the best man.
Mr Ogden, the witness.

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:53.030
We'll fill out the forms later.

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.951
Now then.

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:58.077
Do you, Henry Lewisham
Arthur Hudson...

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.799
take this woman to be
your lawful wedded wife...

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:03.189
till death do you part?

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:05.589
Oh! Oh!

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.672
- Well, he's just over-excited.
- Water!

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:16.478
Hudson, whatever
made you faint?

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:19.836
I suppose it was the excitement
of those drastic words.

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.718
- Drastic?
- "Till death do us part. "

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:26.554
- That's no reflection on you, madam.
- Now what's going to happen?

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:28.949
That's what I would like to know.

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.679
Nothing's going to happen.
You'll retire as usual.

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:34.638
Hudson will sleep in the same room,
but in the other bed of course.

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:39.032
- I hope so.
- The other bed. The one near the door.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.588
Just not to obfuscate matters.

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:46.038
Listen, this marriage
is just a formality.

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:50.989
- The moment we get ashore, I want a divorce.
- Whatever your desire is.

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:54.356
I am always at your service.

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:57.876
Hudson, don't let
the champagne go to your head.

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:01.077
- Better go to bed.
- Very well, sir. Goodnight, Mr Ogden.

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:03.469
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Mr Harvey.

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:07.951
Madam, I presume
I'll see you later.

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:13.235
Where are you going?
There's the bedroom.

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:21.480
The whole thing is an awful mess.

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:25.712
- This is Harvey's idea.
- Why can't I sleep on the sofa?

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:29.236
- Natascha, let's don't go into all that again.
- Where do you sleep?

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:32.118
I have to sit up and explain
the situation to Martha.

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:34.509
<i>Why don't you have the Captain explain?</i>

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:36.272
He's gone ashore.

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:39.557
If Martha finds you here without
an explanation, it's gonna create scandal.

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:42.393
I hate to interrupt. But I think
Martha just drove up in a Cadillac.

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:46.598
- Natascha, please go to bed!
- How can I with that man?

01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:58.029
There's no lock on this door.

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:04.593
- That man is crazy.
- Oh, Natascha, please go to bed.

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:08.229
To think of having to do all this
to get a passport. Huh!

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:17.991
- Ice water, sir.
- Oh.

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:22.837
- I'll check to see if Martha's arrived yet.
- Okay.

01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:50.431
Goodnight.

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:01.151
Oh!

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:04.550
In the excitement,
I forgot to brush my teeth.

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:37.759
Boo!

01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:13.996
Goodnight.

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:47.911
Aah!

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:19.110
Hudson, find me some pyjamas.

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:24.075
Oh, you've got mine on.
Find me something to sleep in.

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:27.755
- Hasn't she arrived yet?
- No, not yet. Expected momentarily.

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:30.957
- I'm so nervous.
- Natascha, don't worry.

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:35.511
Please, don't worry. Everything will
work out the minute we get you ashore.

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:39.434
- Do you require a valise, sir?
- No, I'll take them.

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:41.351
Thank you.

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:44.869
- Now, trust me.
- Hmm.

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:50.949
- Goodnight, Hudson.
- Goodnight, sir.

01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:58.271
<i>It's Harvey!</i>

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:04.872
I just heard from Martha. She won't
be coming aboard till 12.00 tomorrow.

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:10.115
Goodnight, Harv.

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:16.868
- Hudson, in the other room. I'm sleeping here tonight.
- Oh.

01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:21.029
- Goodnight, sir.
- Goodnight.

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:28.718
Oh! Oh.

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:36.116
May I come in?

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.760
Excuse me. My medicine.

01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:19.870
<i>Mr Hudson?</i>

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:38.508
<i>Mr Hudson, your tea.</i>

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:41.717
- Oh! Wait a moment!
- Oh!

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.789
Good morning, sir.
Congratulations.

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:49.711
Huh.

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:55.479
Good morning, madam.
Your tea.

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:57.391
Mmm.

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:02.516
- Would you like to order breakfast, sir?
- Hmm?

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:04.909
Oh.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.710
I think I'll have the oatmeal porridge,
the English pork sausages...

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:13.110
Oh, pardon me, madam.
What would you like for breakfast?

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:15.316
Eggs and bacon,
toast and coffee.

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:18.392
Eggs and bacon,
toast and coffee.

01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:35.478
I hate to disturb you,
but there's a little trouble...

01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:37.869
about Mrs Hudson's papers
having been blown overboard.

01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:41.157
They say the marriage isn't legal unless
she produces her identification papers.

01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:46.598
What do they expect the lady to do, jump in the
middle of the Pacific Ocean to recover her papers?

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:52.118
Unfortunately, there's a report that a lady stowaway
is aboard, and they're taking every precaution.

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:55.397
What's a stowaway got to do with it?
All that's involved is a marriage.

01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:57.789
You were witness to that.
You married them.

01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:00.155
Nevertheless, they want
to see the lady's passport.

01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:02.800
She doesn't need a passport
to go ashore in Honolulu.

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:05.474
<i>She's married to an American citizen.</i>

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:08.472
Quite so. But if her papers
of identification are missing...

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:11.074
<i>then a marriage at sea
is not recognized.</i>

01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:14.038
<i>She's an alien and will have to go
before an Immigration board of enquiry.</i>

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:17.795
<i>The purser's asked to see you, sir.</i>

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:22.908
Yes, of course. I'll see him right away.
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:29.229
It's time for me to disappear.

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:32.278
Why? The Captain married you,
and that's a legal fact.

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:37.559
- But the marriage has not yet been consummated, sir.
- Yet? Hmph.

01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:40.279
Hudson, your mind
is running in another channel.

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:43.318
The important thing is the papers.

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:45.595
What are you gonna tell them
about the papers?

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:48.114
Mr Ogden didn't tell me
anything about papers.

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:52.273
Her identification papers,
her birth certificate, her passport!

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:55.318
We've been all through that with you.
What are you gonna tell them?

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:58.995
- Oh, that. I shall tell them the truth, as you told me.
- As I told you?

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:01.548
As you told me to tell it.

01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:05.872
I didn't tell you anything.
You remember that. Go ahead.

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:09.191
I can only tell them
how I met my first wife.

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:11.589
How you first met
your wife. Oh!

01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:15.309
It was a breezy afternoon.
I was walking on the top deck...

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:18.710
and there she was, holding
down some papers in her lap.

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:21.951
<i>- It was love at first sight.
- Ugh!</i>

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:25.350
- Hurry up and get to the point, Hudson.
- Yes, sir.

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:29.672
Suddenly, there was a gust of wind,
and the papers blew overboard.

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:32.672
Hudson, you have literary talent.

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:41.071
We better go, Mr Hudson.
The Immigration officials are waiting.

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:47.437
No, now wait Just one moment.
I think I should go with Hudson.

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:50.478
An excellent idea.
Your presence will be efficacious.

01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:54.838
- Would you like me to go along?
- No, stay here and look after Natascha.

01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:58.348
Don't worry.

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:00.749
Mr Mears, I think we better go.

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:04.637
Come along, Hudson.

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:11.273
<i>- Harvey, you remember what
I told you about Honolulu?</i>

01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:13.999
- You're not going to dive off the boat?
- Now is the time.

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:16.833
While they're questioning Hudson.

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:35.715
<i>Oh!</i>

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:44.636
- I'll see you on the beach at Waikiki.
- Mm-hmm.

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:49.271
- If I'm far off, jump up and down, then I'll recognize you.
- Mm.

01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:52.272
So if I make it,
I'll see you later.

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:57.639
<i>Hmm. Here's another one.</i>

01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:02.157
If you make it?

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:04.993
Wait a minute!
What do you mean, "If you make it"?

01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:06.513
<i>- I'm scared.
- What?</i>

01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:08.511
And here goes.

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:19.069
<i>What's going on out there?</i>

01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:21.390
That's a Hawaiian
diving off the boat.

01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:26.676
Now, Mr Hudson,
we'd like to see your wife.

01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:29.320
I believe she's taking a bath.

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:40.909
Oh, my. How nice.

01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:46.037
<i>Maria, qu'avez vous fait
de nos bagages?</i>

01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:49.078
<i>J'en ai gardé quartre et je vais renvoyer
le reste par IAmerican Express.</i>

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:51.469
<i>- Comme vous me I'avez demandé.
- C'est bon.</i>

01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:54.996
<i>- Est-ce que c'est votre suite?
- Je crois.</i>

01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:58.993
- Ah, Martha!
- Hello, Harvey.

01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:01.719
- Oh, what comfortable quarters you have.
- Oh, yes.

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:04.598
Lovely. Where's Ogden?

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:07.319
Uh, he's up in the lounge
with Hudson.

01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:09.709
You know, Hudson's married now.

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:12.553
Hudson married?
Oh, really? That's odd.

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:16.030
Yes. Ah, well,
the Captain married them.

01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:19.078
- Can I get you something?
- No, it's much too early.

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:24.669
Captain, this is
Mrs Ogden Mears.

01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:28.514
- How do you do? Pardon me.
- How do you do?

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:31.068
- We're still waiting for Mrs Hudson.
- She's taking a bath.

01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:33.799
She should be finished.
I'll go and see.

01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:38.591
Well.

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:45.274
Can I get you something, Captain?

01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:48.033
<i>- No, thanks. But if you don't mind my waiting.
- Quite all right.</i>

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.629
- Hello, Martha.
- Hello, Ogden.

01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:07.078
Well, you've met the Captain.

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:09.799
- Yes, of course.
- We're looking for Mrs Hudson.

01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:12.917
The Immigration officers are in the lounge
and I don't like to keep them waiting.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.754
- Not in the bathroom. I looked all over.
- It's very serious.

01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:21.072
Without her identification papers,
she can't land anywhere. She doesn't exist.

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:26.518
- If she doesn't exist, there's no problem.
- I think we should look for her.

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:29.717
It might be a good idea if you had
another look in the bathroom.

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:33.236
Martha,
would you excuse us for a moment?

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:35.197
All right, Captain.

01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:43.357
Hey!

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:48.108
<i>- Waikiki?
Hop in the back, sister.</i>

01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:50.077
Thank you!

01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:06.754
Whew! That's the strangest thing
I've ever known.

01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:08.671
She's disappeared.

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:15.155
I think we better search
the entire boat.

01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:25.391
Good morning, madam.

01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:28.119
Congratulations, Hudson.
I hear you're married now.

01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:30.270
Well, in a way, yes.

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.351
Hudson, what do you mean?

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:35.910
The marriage has not yet
been consummated.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.151
- What is she, an American?
- No, madam, she is from Hong Kong.

01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:42.357
<i>- Chinese?
- I shouldn't think so, madam.</i>

01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:44.431
<i>She is a Russian emigré.</i>

01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:49.275
- Well, I should like to meet her.
- I'll do my best, madam.

01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:52.191
Well.

01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:55.636
Hudson, it seems as though
your wife has disappeared.

01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:58.518
Oh, that's awful.
Poor Hudson.

01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:02.752
- I was beginning to grow very fond of her.
- What have you done to the lady?

01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:05.957
Oh, nothing, madam.
The marriage was never consummated.

01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:08.508
You've got "consummated"
on the brain.

01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:14.392
- I think I'll go ashore and do some shopping.
- I think I'll go with you, Harvey.

01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:16.277
Don't go yet, Ogden.

01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:18.874
I've just ordered lunch, and there's one
or two things I'd like to discuss with you.

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:22.032
I'll stay and have something with you.
What has madam ordered?

01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:24.236
- A consummated soup, sir.
- What's that?

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:26.629
Consommé, sir.

01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:30.156
- Cold chicken, asparagus and a bottle of Chablis.
- I'll have the same.

01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:34.791
- I'll see you both later.
- The Waikiki Hotel at 5.30 for cocktails.

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:36.711
Uh, you may go, Hudson.

01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:44.874
- Did you hear from Washington?
- I got this letter this morning.

01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:46.791
Here's the substance of it:

01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:50.555
"To allay rumours of divorce, Martha and
you should return to the States together.

01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:55.270
I advise this because of my great
affection for you both. " Etc., etc., etc.

01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:57.237
So.

01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:00.949
If this arrangement
doesn't work out...

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:03.315
how will it affect
my divorce settlement?

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:05.960
You can put that in escrow.

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:10.477
Unfortunately, the only interest I have
is money, having had no children.

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:13.199
- Am I to blame for that?
- No.

01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:15.669
No, neither one of us is to blame.

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:18.433
The desire for happiness
fooled us both.

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:20.590
Happiness, eh?

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:24.479
I was going to say "love"...

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:27.950
but I don't think either one of us
knows what the word means.

01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:31.555
In any case, what are you
gonna do about Washington?

01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:34.234
Well...

01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:38.108
I don't look forward to spending
the rest of my life in Saudi Arabia.

01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:46.709
She has long, dark hair,
wears a sarong...

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:48.631
and looks like a Hawaiian.

01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:51.598
A lot of dames look
like that around here.

01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:54.069
She said she'd meet me
on the beach at Waikiki.

01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:58.073
- I think she's kidding you.
- Maybe.

01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:02.915
- Where's the beach at Waikiki?
- That's the Waikiki Hotel.

01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:22.679
- Can I check this suitcase, please?
- Certainly, sir.

01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:25.069
- What name?
- Harvey Crothers.

01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:27.799
Check Mr Crothers' case
into the cloakroom.

01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:31.953
- Is the Waikiki Beach near here?
- It's just outside, sir.

01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:33.871
That's strange.

01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:53.071
I can't stop!

01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:56.436
Oh! All this jumping up and down
is like running ten miles.

01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:59.318
It's so good
to see you again.

01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:02.198
Let's sit down.

01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:07.989
I didn't think I'd see you again
after that dive. It was perfect.

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:11.436
- What's happening on the boat?
- They're still waiting for you in the lounge.

01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:13.954
<i>- And Ogden?
- He's with his wife.</i>

01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:17.311
Yes.

01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:20.437
I bought you some clothes.
Oh, I know the other ones were too big.

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:24.115
<i>These are smaller. There's a place
you can change next to the pool.</i>

01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:26.111
Meanwhile, I'll book you a room
at the hotel.

01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:29.158
- They might be looking for Mrs Hudson.
- Not a chance.

01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:31.071
I'll book them under my name.

01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:33.958
For the time being,
you're Mrs Harvey Crothers.

01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:38.271
- Remember me?
- Yes, sir.

01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:41.158
- I'd like an outside suite.
- Certainly. For yourself?

01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:44.118
- For my wife. I'm leaving for the mainland.
- Very well.

01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:47.476
- Do you wish to see the rooms now?
- No, I'll wait for my wife.

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:49.790
- Fine.
- Well, here she...

01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:53.475
- Well!
- It doesn't fit. This is too tight.

01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:58.355
I can't breathe.

01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:00.271
You dropped your change.

01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:03.193
Will you sign the register,
Mrs Crothers?

01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:08.275
- C-R-O...
- T-H...

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:15.791
She's not here.

01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:18.713
- Let's have some tea.
- Yeah.

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:25.151
Ah, there he is.

01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:30.679
I'm sorry I'm late. I had to leave
Ogden with the Immigration authorities.

01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:33.877
- It seems they're still looking for Hudson's wife.
- Ah, yes.

01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:36.110
There she is.

01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:38.998
Hudson, you haven't been
drinking before lunch?

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:41.799
The poor man is so distressed
since his wife went away.

01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:44.917
That's the third person
he's mistaken for his wife.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.436
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Martha, this is my wife, Mrs Crothers.

01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:52.274
- Mrs Ogden Mears.
- How do you do?

01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:54.476
How do you do?

01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:01.193
You know, Harvey is so secretive.

01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:04.078
He never told me a word
about his marriage.

01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:07.914
Well, there's not much to tell.
We haven't been married long.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.831
Have we?

01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:12.229
As soon as something develops,
we'll let you know.

01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:15.430
No, I mean,
when did you marry?

01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:18.637
Ah-ha-ha!
That's the secret.

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:21.518
However, you must bring
your wife to Arabia...

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:24.558
once we've refurbished
the Embassy, but not before...

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:26.949
otherwise you'll have to sleep
in a tent like the rest of us.

01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:29.679
<i>A tent? That's rather romantic.</i>

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:33.355
- That depends with whom you share it.
- Hmm.

01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:36.398
- Martha, would you like to dance?
- I'd love it.

01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:39.756
It'll give me a chance to give
some advice to the lovelorn.

01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:55.398
This is the first chance I've had
to speak to you alone.

01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:01.518
There's very little time,
and I've a lot to tell you.

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:04.398
Harvey will be staying behind,
so I'll be in touch with you through him.

01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:06.789
<i>He'll be working on
a passport for you.</i>

01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:08.711
Martha's coming with me.

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:11.598
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:18.034
I got a letter from Washington saying
that Martha should go with me...

01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:20.270
to Saudi Arabia
for appearances' sake.

01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:22.237
Of course.

01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:26.154
Please try to understand.

01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:28.117
Of course.

01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:32.111
For appearances' sake.

01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:36.910
For the esteem of people
I don't give a damn about.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.754
If I had the guts,
I'd rid myself of the whole thing:

01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:43.957
Washington, Saudi Arabia and everything.

01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:46.156
You can't do that.

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:02.477
Be careful.
We're being watched.

01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:04.869
The legal eye is upon us.

01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:12.068
You must believe me when I tell you this
is the first real happiness I've known.

01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:14.230
I love you very much.

01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:19.471
- Your wife looks sad.
- You think so?

01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:22.632
What nonsense.
She's not your wife.

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:26.952
- Martha, you're being silly!
- Not as silly as you think.

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:30.999
I've been talking to someone
who knew her in Hong Kong.

01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:34.516
The boat passes here at 11.00.

01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:38.195
I'll be on deck imagining that
you're sitting here at this table.

01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:40.157
Let's dance.

01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:43.799
I can't.

01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:47.350
I must go to my room
before your wife returns.

01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:51.877
I can't say goodbye.
I can't trust myself.

01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:56.156
Will you excuse me?

01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:05.511
Well, goodbye.
Harvey will take care of everything.

01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:07.909
All right. Thank you.

01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:18.439
What's happened to Mrs Crothers?

01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:21.478
She had a splitting headache
and asked to be excused.

01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:24.028
- She won't be seeing us off?
- I don't think so.

01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:28.193
- She's going straight to bed.
- Can't we go and see her for a moment?

01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:31.078
- It'll be best to let her rest quietly.
- Pardon me, madam.

01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:34.596
- It's time to leave for the boat.
- Oh, so soon?

01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:36.991
Well.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.437
Hudson, I will need these three closets
and Mr Mears can have the end one.

01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:49.351
Very well, madam.

01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:56.038
Your big trunks
I'm having put in the hold...

01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:58.759
so there'll be more room
for madam's wardrobe.

01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:00.671
Okay, Hudson.

01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:24.991
<i>Voil?</i>

01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:32.994
- Hudson, have you found your wife yet?
- Not yet, madam.

01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:35.389
Surely you're not going
to leave without her.

01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:40.190
Whatever happens, I shall deport myself
as a husband and a gentleman.

01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:43.231
Maria.

01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:47.194
Oh! What's this?

01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:52.917
Hudson, does this
belong to your wife?

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.675
I haven't the faintest idea.
We haven't been married that long.

01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:58.591
Oh!

01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:03.037
Perhaps you might know something
about this, Your Excellency.

01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:08.313
It looks like a two-ring circus.

01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:15.471
Ogden, you must be losing
your sense of propriety.

01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:18.677
You not only humiliate me
in front of people...

01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:24.278
but you insult my intelligence by introducing
that woman as Mrs Harvey Crothers...

01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:28.672
and then again as Mrs Hudson
when she's sleeping here in your cabin.

01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:33.557
<i>As Ambassador to Saudi Arabia,
it is not exactly comme il faut...</i>

01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:37.076
to include in your entourage,
the mistress of a gangster.

01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:38.991
A prostitute.

01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:44.589
I wonder what your fate would have
been in similar circumstances.

01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:27.877
Hello.

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:31.111
- Hello, Harvey? Ogden.
- Haven't you left yet?

01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:34.112
- No, I got off with the pilot boat.
- What happened?

01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:36.509
I don't know.
I just couldn't take it.

01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:39.034
Aren't you going to Washington?
What about your career?

01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:40.951
I'd rather be happy
than president.

01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:43.270
<i>Listen, where is everybody?</i>

01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:47.876
- You know who, your wife.
- I think you mean my wife.

01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:50.554
Hudson's giving me
an argument here.

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:52.949
She came down
to the cabaret after you left...

01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:55.429
and she's been by the window,
looking out at the sea ever since.

01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:58.557
- Did you tell her the news?
- I told her there was nothing to worry about.

01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:00.949
The Immigration people have
given her the benefit of the doubt.

01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:03.679
She's now Hudson's wife,
married to an American citizen.

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:06.593
Listen, don't tell her I'm here.
I want to surprise her.

01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:16.310
Ogden!

01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:19.358
- Well, buddy, I hope you're doing the right thing.
- Where is she?

01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:21.954
Right where you left her,
sitting by the window.

01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.749
<i>See you in the morning.</i>

01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:32.191
<i>Yes, sir?</i>

01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:35.192
I'm looking for a young lady. I believe
she's sitting alone by the window.

01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:37.157
Yes, sir.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.831
Ogden!

01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:11.151
See, you can't get rid of me.

01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:13.276
May I have this dance?

01:41:14.305 --> 01:41:20.775
