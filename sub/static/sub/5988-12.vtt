WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:04.737
<i> Previously on</i> Reign...
Gideon, we can't.

00:04.739 --> 00:06.705
I'm sorry, I just, um...
We might be friends,

00:06.707 --> 00:08.407
but our countries
are still enemies.

00:08.409 --> 00:10.376
It's one thing to pretend,
but to let this be real...

00:10.378 --> 00:12.177
You're pregnant.
I've already arranged to give

00:12.179 --> 00:13.679
the child to a loving family.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.247
Amy Dudley is dead.

00:15.249 --> 00:17.583
A servant at the Dudley's
country house found her body.

00:17.585 --> 00:19.218
<i> She was at the bottom</i>
<i> of the stairs</i>

00:19.220 --> 00:20.786
with a broken neck.
And now rumors

00:20.788 --> 00:22.788
are already spreading
that Dudley murdered his wife.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.189
He might hang
as a murderer.

00:24.191 --> 00:25.257
Do you want
to be accused as well?

00:25.259 --> 00:26.525
I didn't kill her.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.093
We cannot be seen together.

00:28.095 --> 00:30.062
I have my kingdom
and the future

00:30.064 --> 00:31.463
of my reign to consider.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.365
I'm going to ask the Vatican
for funds.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.534
I no longer have
French soldiers to rely on.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.137
And Scottish Catholic forces
are severely depleted.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.372
Queen Elizabeth will see
your raising a Catholic army

00:40.374 --> 00:42.307
as an act of aggression.
This is about

00:42.309 --> 00:44.043
taking what is mine.

00:47.314 --> 00:51.316
(whinnying)

00:54.255 --> 00:56.455
So this is what
my receiving line

00:56.457 --> 00:58.290
has been reduced to--

00:58.292 --> 00:59.591
an English spy?

00:59.593 --> 01:01.360
Queen Mary, how was Rome?

01:02.363 --> 01:03.695
I see your
valet Jeffrey

01:03.697 --> 01:05.330
has returned from England.

01:05.332 --> 01:06.565
Are you officially
reporting to him now?

01:06.567 --> 01:09.234
Your trip to the Vatican
has caused some...

01:09.236 --> 01:11.336
problems for me with Elizabeth.

01:11.338 --> 01:14.073
What does she know?
That you wish
to return to Scotland,

01:14.075 --> 01:15.541
but because the Protestants
have taken over,

01:15.543 --> 01:17.276
you need an army
to return home safely

01:17.278 --> 01:18.577
and went to Rome to ask for one.

01:18.579 --> 01:22.314
As I warned you,
she was displeased.

01:22.316 --> 01:24.383
So I shouldn't have gone
to the Vatican, is that it?

01:24.385 --> 01:26.552
Are you all right?

01:26.554 --> 01:29.088
What's happened? Mary.

01:29.090 --> 01:32.424
The Vatican has refused
to fund my mission

01:32.426 --> 01:35.127
to reclaim my throne.
Respectfully.

01:35.129 --> 01:37.196
Gideon, I have
lost everything.

01:37.198 --> 01:40.232
My mother, my husband...
and now my country.

01:40.234 --> 01:42.334
And not even Rome
will help me get it back.

01:43.404 --> 01:45.604
Mary, I...

01:45.606 --> 01:49.441
I'm so sorry.

01:49.443 --> 01:52.411
Even if I tried
to return home, who's to say

01:52.413 --> 01:54.546
Elizabeth would let me cross
the English Channel safely?

01:54.548 --> 01:56.281
I'm trapped here.

01:56.283 --> 02:00.119
I'm going to have to tell
Elizabeth about this.

02:00.121 --> 02:02.387
I know you do.

02:02.389 --> 02:04.523
She'd learn soon enough anyway.

02:07.495 --> 02:08.794
This is for your daughter.

02:08.796 --> 02:10.229
I saw it in Rome.

02:10.231 --> 02:12.397
Agatha will love it.
Thank you.

02:16.804 --> 02:19.338
Mary. Welcome back.
Oh, I'm sorry

02:19.340 --> 02:20.806
I wasn't there to greet you.

02:20.808 --> 02:23.308
I was planning my tour
of the provinces for the spring.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.610
Oh, the regency suits you.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.545
I did see you arriving
from my window.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.614
I couldn't help
but notice you talking

02:28.616 --> 02:32.384
with the English ambassador
at some length.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.253
I was lying to him,

02:34.255 --> 02:37.356
telling him my mission
in Rome was a failure.

02:37.358 --> 02:40.392
The Vatican was
steadfastly behind me.

02:40.394 --> 02:43.529
They've agreed to help me
gather any forces I need.

02:43.531 --> 02:46.732
Oh, you're playing possum
while building a Catholic army.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.534
My enemies in England
and Scotland

02:48.536 --> 02:50.736
can't stop me if they
don't know my plans.

02:50.738 --> 02:54.239
The element of surprise
will help when you arrive.

02:54.241 --> 02:56.575
You do have many Protestants
against you--

02:56.577 --> 02:58.377
that zealot John Knox,

02:58.379 --> 03:00.212
not to mention
the Highland tribes,

03:00.214 --> 03:02.548
with disregard for any monarchy.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.650
Elizabeth cannot know, either.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.785
So Gideon must be
kept in the dark.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.454
Is that difficult for you--
to lie to him?

03:09.456 --> 03:11.456
No, it's not
difficult at all.

03:11.458 --> 03:13.292
Before you left for Rome
I couldn't help but notice

03:13.294 --> 03:15.761
you were spending
a lot of time together.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.563
There seems to be...

03:17.565 --> 03:20.899
a connection between you.

03:20.901 --> 03:24.436
Are you encouraging me to take
an English spy as my lover?

03:24.438 --> 03:26.305
As Francis' mother,

03:26.307 --> 03:28.507
if you want permission,
I give it to you.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.642
Take some comfort.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.377
Just remember:

03:32.379 --> 03:34.446
enjoy him but never trust him.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.381
If forced to take a side,

03:36.383 --> 03:38.650
Gideon will always
choose Elizabeth.

03:43.357 --> 03:46.358
¶ ¶

03:46.360 --> 03:48.527
MAN:
Your Highness?

03:48.529 --> 03:52.364
Your Highness?

03:52.366 --> 03:55.500
As we were saying--
without an heir,

03:55.502 --> 03:57.469
and-and in the wake of the
recent assassination attempt

03:57.471 --> 04:00.939
against you, we urge you
to name a successor immediately.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.407
I am recovered,

04:02.409 --> 04:04.576
healthy and strong.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.412
But I'm sure you have
suggestions for my successor.

04:07.414 --> 04:10.515
We recommend Henry Hastings,
third earl of Huntingdon.

04:10.517 --> 04:12.484
A man of royal blood,

04:12.486 --> 04:13.885
a devout Protestant,

04:13.887 --> 04:15.687
he'd make a fine king.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.022
But, as you've all been

04:17.024 --> 04:18.023
pressuring me for weeks,

04:18.025 --> 04:19.725
I've made my choice.

04:19.727 --> 04:21.994
This is good news, Your Majesty.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.431
Should I die, the English throne

04:26.433 --> 04:28.400
will be passed to my cousin.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.469
Mary, Queen of Scots.

04:30.471 --> 04:31.536
(all murmuring)

04:31.538 --> 04:33.772
Your... cousin?

04:33.774 --> 04:36.742
She's a...
Catholic? A woman?

04:36.744 --> 04:38.710
Yes. She also has a claim

04:38.712 --> 04:41.613
to my throne,
and should she accept

04:41.615 --> 04:43.582
and be named my successor,

04:43.584 --> 04:44.750
she will be publicly admitting

04:44.752 --> 04:46.451
that<i> I</i> am the rightful queen

04:46.453 --> 04:48.920
and hers is the weaker,
secondary claim.

04:48.922 --> 04:51.290
Then why would she do it?

04:51.292 --> 04:52.658
Scotland is Protestant.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.993
She's all but lost her throne.
And Gideon...

04:54.995 --> 04:56.928
Lord Blackburn, has informed me

04:56.930 --> 04:58.730
even her support in Rome
has faded.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.532
But that can change
if she marries

05:00.534 --> 05:03.335
a powerful husband,
forges another alliance.

05:03.337 --> 05:05.504
Which is why I'll demand,
in return,

05:05.506 --> 05:07.506
the power to choose
her next husband.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.408
Not a foreign power,

05:09.410 --> 05:11.677
but a weak Englishman
of my choosing.

05:11.679 --> 05:14.813
Her marriage is the last card
she has to play,

05:14.815 --> 05:16.548
and I intend
to reach across the table

05:16.550 --> 05:18.550
and claim it as my own.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.585
That was shrewd.

05:20.587 --> 05:23.422
You chose the only person
they want less than you--

05:23.424 --> 05:25.524
a Scottish, Catholic woman.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.592
They wanted a successor,

05:27.594 --> 05:29.728
so I gave them one.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.997
Thank you, gentlemen.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.498
Catherine,

05:33.500 --> 05:35.567
I have news.
Important enough

05:35.569 --> 05:37.636
for you to miss
the privy council meeting today?

05:37.638 --> 05:38.704
(door closes)
I hope you're still not

05:38.706 --> 05:40.472
pining for the regency.

05:40.474 --> 05:42.908
Water under the bridge.
I'm sure it is.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.844
Or perhaps this has to do
with your dear wife.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.546
I understand that
she hasn't answered

05:47.548 --> 05:49.681
a single one of your letters.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.683
Must be difficult

05:51.685 --> 05:53.585
to know she'd rather
be in enemy territory

05:53.587 --> 05:55.420
than your bedchambers.

05:55.422 --> 05:57.022
As I said,

05:57.024 --> 06:00.092
I have news.

06:00.094 --> 06:02.694
I told you before
that I did not

06:02.696 --> 06:04.696
frame you
for Francis' poisoning.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.398
Well, I'm here to prove it.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.136
A signed confession
from the royal embalmer

06:11.138 --> 06:14.639
saying that he fled without
removing Francis' organs.

06:14.641 --> 06:17.008
And as I extracted
the truth from him,

06:17.010 --> 06:20.011
he confessed that he'd been
bribed by Cardinal Morel.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.680
the very man who drove

06:21.682 --> 06:22.714
the inquest against you.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.015
You would
have me believe

06:24.017 --> 06:25.650
that the Vatican
has turned against me--

06:25.652 --> 06:27.586
a Catholic royal?

06:27.588 --> 06:30.021
Well, what if<i> he</i> were
simply turned, not the Vatican?

06:30.023 --> 06:31.656
Any man
can be swayed

06:31.658 --> 06:33.558
to a different purpose,
even a man of the cloth.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.128
By whom?
Someone who
does not want you

06:36.130 --> 06:37.763
as ruler of France.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.600
Oh right, someone other than me.

06:41.602 --> 06:45.437
I only stepped in once
the job became open, I swear.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.407
You want to earn back my favor?

06:48.409 --> 06:50.142
Find Cardinal Morel
and bring him to me.

06:50.144 --> 06:51.910
Don't disturb me

06:51.912 --> 06:54.613
till you've completed your task.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.681
Being the regent of France,
I'm extremely busy.

06:56.683 --> 06:58.049
You understand.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.056
Oh.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.992
(mirror clatters)
Christophe.

07:06.994 --> 07:10.595
You can't be in my chambers.

07:10.597 --> 07:14.533
I'm gonna have that secret
passage sealed tomorrow.

07:14.535 --> 07:15.801
I needed to talk to you.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.636
There's nothing to talk about.

07:17.638 --> 07:20.172
I thought we'd finally reached
an understanding-- I won't

07:20.174 --> 07:21.907
tell anyone
what you did to Claude,

07:21.909 --> 07:23.608
you keep the regency.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.076
But now I discover
Bash is assigning me

07:25.078 --> 07:27.145
to Chambord
to clear the chateau grounds

07:27.147 --> 07:29.448
of a wolf infestation.

07:29.450 --> 07:30.949
Yes, it's a nasty pack,
I'm told.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.618
You ordered this.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.153
You're sending me
away for months

07:35.155 --> 07:37.088
because you know
that I will kill again.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.990
But does it really
change anything

07:38.992 --> 07:40.625
for me to be far away?

07:40.627 --> 07:41.927
I'd feel better.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.495
Because you won't see it?
Yes.

07:43.497 --> 07:44.563
Because it won't be happening

07:44.565 --> 07:45.664
under my own roof.

07:45.666 --> 07:48.700
Well. If it will
make you feel better.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.537
Is there really no way
for you to stop?

07:52.539 --> 07:54.506
No.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.107
I'm sure

07:56.109 --> 07:58.643
I will enjoy
hunting in Chambord.

07:58.645 --> 08:01.480
But I will miss you, Catherine.

08:04.084 --> 08:06.218
(sighs)

08:06.220 --> 08:08.487
(laughter,
indistinct conversations)

08:11.825 --> 08:13.225
You look like my friend Greer.

08:13.227 --> 08:14.793
She's a lovely girl,

08:14.795 --> 08:16.061
thriving business,

08:16.063 --> 08:17.596
hasn't been to court in weeks.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.731
She sounds familiar.

08:19.733 --> 08:22.734
I'm sorry
I've been away so often.

08:22.736 --> 08:25.070
Uh, truth be told,
I-I haven't been feeling well.

08:25.072 --> 08:26.805
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.039
I hope it's nothing serious.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.941
No, no, nothing serious.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.811
I really have missed you, Greer.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.212
With Lola gone,
I've been...

08:34.214 --> 08:36.081
I didn't come here

08:36.083 --> 08:37.649
to feel sorry for myself.

08:37.651 --> 08:39.217
I came to share some good news.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.152
I'll be returning
to Scotland soon,

08:41.154 --> 08:42.687
but no one must know.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.089
Mary, that's wonderful.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.757
I want you to come with me.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.092
At the very least,
I'm going to need

08:47.094 --> 08:49.828
a flying squadron
of Scottish spies.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.130
I don't suppose there's any way

08:52.132 --> 08:53.965
you could wait
till summer to return?

08:53.967 --> 08:55.534
Summer?

08:55.536 --> 08:57.702
Greer, I'm coordinating
an entire army

08:57.704 --> 08:59.638
in secret. There's only
a small window of time

08:59.640 --> 09:00.805
that I can return.

09:00.807 --> 09:03.975
Yes, of-of course.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.777
Is this an order then?

09:05.779 --> 09:07.846
I'm sorry.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.781
Please try to understand.

09:09.783 --> 09:10.815
I've made a new life
for myself here,

09:10.817 --> 09:12.250
and though it may seem

09:12.252 --> 09:15.620
insignificant to you,
it is everything to me.

09:15.622 --> 09:18.223
Mary, if you command it,
I will return with you.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.758
But...

09:19.760 --> 09:21.660
I'm asking
for permission to stay.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.863
Of course you have permission.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.598
I'm just surprised.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.767
All right.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.902
I should be returning
to the castle.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.971
Thank y...

09:36.043 --> 09:38.109
(dog barking in distance)

09:44.618 --> 09:46.918
Archbishop Ridolfi. My guards
didn't tell me you're here.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.920
What are you doing
in France?

09:48.922 --> 09:50.221
Have you been
having any problems

09:50.223 --> 09:51.923
getting the support you need
for my mission?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.658
I assure you
I have kept Elizabeth

09:53.660 --> 09:55.293
completely in the dark.
No, my child.

09:55.295 --> 09:56.928
Our plans are moving
as we'd hoped.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.230
But there's been
a new development in England.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.665
Our spies
have learned that Elizabeth

10:00.667 --> 10:01.766
is sending you an offer

10:01.768 --> 10:04.069
to succeed her
as queen of England.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.937
In return,

10:05.939 --> 10:08.006
she will choose
your next husband.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.776
Accepting would mean conceding

10:11.778 --> 10:14.312
that she is the rightful
queen of England.

10:14.314 --> 10:15.880
As for the husband,
she'll choose somebody

10:15.882 --> 10:17.949
benefitting England,
not Scotland.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.684
Mary, when the offer comes,
you are going to accept.

10:19.686 --> 10:21.620
Why?

10:21.622 --> 10:23.288
She seeks to disempower me

10:23.290 --> 10:25.790
by forcing me into a marriage
with whatever weak suitor

10:25.792 --> 10:28.793
she chooses-- most likely
a Protestant, mind you.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.095
Don't worry about the marriage.

10:30.097 --> 10:32.397
Rome will help you,
and you will help Rome.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.332
How does this help Rome?

10:34.334 --> 10:36.701
Mary, we want a Catholic
ruling England.

10:36.703 --> 10:38.837
Once you're officially
named her successor

10:38.839 --> 10:40.205
Elizabeth will be...

10:41.642 --> 10:42.807
...removed.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.110
First, we are

10:45.112 --> 10:47.278
going to help you
retake Scotland.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.348
And then we are going to put you
on the English throne.

10:57.858 --> 11:00.825
(indistinct conversations)

11:00.827 --> 11:03.895
Christophe left
for Chambord this morning.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.697
It will be months before
you see him at court again.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.198
Thank you, Sebastian.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.733
I'd appreciate it

11:08.735 --> 11:09.834
if you'd stop using me

11:09.836 --> 11:12.303
to clean up
your personal affairs.

11:13.407 --> 11:15.774
Ah, Charles.

11:15.776 --> 11:19.244
This is Arturo. He's an old
family friend and a leader

11:19.246 --> 11:22.714
of the finest theater troupe
in Italy. You met him

11:22.716 --> 11:24.249
when you were just a child.
And now

11:24.251 --> 11:26.084
I meet you as King of France.

11:26.086 --> 11:29.387
It is a great honor
to perform for your court.

11:29.389 --> 11:32.357
Mother tells me your troupe
performs all over Europe.
Thanks to

11:32.359 --> 11:34.893
the generous patronage
of the Medici family.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.394
But tonight's performance
will be

11:36.396 --> 11:38.463
unlike anything you have seen.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.799
It is an Italian comedy.

11:40.801 --> 11:44.035
Wonderful. We could
use a happy ending.

11:44.037 --> 11:47.839
What better way to celebrate
your rule and mine, huh?

11:47.841 --> 11:50.909
And I expect both you
and your sister to be there.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.110
(clears throat)
Your Majesty,

11:52.112 --> 11:53.745
Queen Mary wishes
to speak with you.

11:53.747 --> 11:54.746
Privately.

11:54.748 --> 11:56.915
I did not misunderstand.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.750
They plan
to kill Elizabeth

11:58.752 --> 12:00.218
after she names me
her successor.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.287
(scoffs) You know that
I spent time with Elizabeth,

12:02.289 --> 12:04.889
and I liked her.
But she is your foe.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.224
Catherine, she is my cousin.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.859
Mary, her death would mean

12:07.861 --> 12:09.461
the end your rivalry.

12:09.463 --> 12:14.032
You can unite England
and Scotland under your rule.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.935
You yourself said that it's
important not to set a precedent

12:16.937 --> 12:18.369
of killing monarchs.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.405
You wouldn't be killing anyone.
The Vatican would.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.040
How thinly veiled is that?

12:22.042 --> 12:25.944
After a bitter rivalry,
I take Elizabeth's throne

12:25.946 --> 12:27.245
and benefit from her death?

12:27.247 --> 12:29.080
The world would blame me.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.949
There is every chance

12:30.951 --> 12:32.350
I would be struck down
in retaliation.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.918
The Vatican must know that.

12:37.324 --> 12:40.525
I'm just a pawn, aren't I?

12:40.527 --> 12:43.361
Even if I were assassinated,
they'd just...

12:43.363 --> 12:46.264
replace me
with the next Catholic in line.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.067
A man would be their preference,
don't you think?

12:49.069 --> 12:52.504
Certainly, I believe
your thinking is right.

12:52.506 --> 12:56.341
But the question is, what are
you going to do about it?

12:56.343 --> 12:58.076
This is the Vatican.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.178
You can't just say
"No, thank you" and walk away.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.447
If you decline
Rome's advice,

13:02.449 --> 13:05.083
you will lose its gold,
its armies.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.951
And I will be powerless
to take back Scotland

13:06.953 --> 13:08.853
from the Protestants.
So what will you do,

13:08.855 --> 13:11.956
try to save Elizabeth
or your country?

13:15.195 --> 13:17.328
(whinnying)

13:17.330 --> 13:20.064
Here. It's chilly.

13:20.066 --> 13:23.835
Do you treat all your political
hostages so kindly?

13:23.837 --> 13:26.004
Only the ones I find useful.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.273
And you, Lola,
have been very helpful.

13:33.213 --> 13:36.214
Are we taking another detour
to the village?

13:36.216 --> 13:38.383
To that same
gray townhouse,

13:38.385 --> 13:40.919
where you disappear
for several hours?

13:40.921 --> 13:42.487
These tours you give me

13:42.489 --> 13:44.489
of the countryside,
they're so you can see

13:44.491 --> 13:46.558
your lover, Robert Dudley.

13:46.560 --> 13:50.094
I assure you,
he is no longer my lover.

13:50.096 --> 13:54.399
That basket is full of wine
from a vineyard near the coast.

13:54.401 --> 13:57.302
I learned this past week
it's his favorite.

13:57.304 --> 14:00.171
I'm sure you're longing
to have a visit

14:00.173 --> 14:01.306
with your son in Scotland.

14:01.308 --> 14:03.141
That can be arranged,

14:03.143 --> 14:05.276
<i> as long as you're discreet</i>

14:05.278 --> 14:06.911
about what I do
in my free time.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.381
Stay in the carriage.

14:10.383 --> 14:11.482
Just be careful.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.585
Robert Dudley is publicly blamed

14:13.587 --> 14:15.086
for the murder of his wife

14:15.088 --> 14:17.055
and for besmirching
your reputation.

14:17.057 --> 14:19.224
I don't think
it's an exaggeration to say

14:19.226 --> 14:21.993
he is the most hated man
in all of England right now.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.895
I appreciate
your concern.

14:23.897 --> 14:25.196
Stay in the carriage.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.571
You shouldn't be here,
Elizabeth.

14:33.573 --> 14:36.374
It's too dangerous.
Didn't you get my note?

14:36.376 --> 14:37.442
I sent a messenger
this morning.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.277
No one saw me.
(sighs)

14:39.279 --> 14:40.612
Yes. But they know I'm here.

14:40.614 --> 14:43.448
Compliments of a nobleman
in the village.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.433
Lord Vendell.

14:45.434 --> 14:47.417
He and his friends
figured out who I am.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.354
I'll move you immediately.

14:49.356 --> 14:53.524
Where? I'll be eventually
recognized wherever I go.

14:53.526 --> 14:57.528
All of England despises me.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.464
You can't keep coming here,
Elizabeth.

14:59.466 --> 15:00.665
It's too much of a risk.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.467
Even for visits
as innocent

15:02.469 --> 15:04.502
as these.
I have no one
to talk to

15:04.504 --> 15:06.271
at court.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.206
You're gone, William's gone.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.074
Exile is too good for him.

15:10.076 --> 15:13.411
He betrayed you, Elizabeth.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.612
I know.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.447
And I know
I should stop seeing you,

15:16.449 --> 15:18.149
as we have no future...

15:19.519 --> 15:21.386
I'm so alone.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.554
Besides,

15:23.556 --> 15:26.424
you are the only man in England

15:26.426 --> 15:28.927
who can beat me at chess.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.595
¶ Down ¶

15:30.597 --> 15:34.432
¶ Never let you down ¶

15:34.434 --> 15:39.437
¶ I never let you down... ¶

15:39.439 --> 15:42.140
(dogs barking in distance)

15:57.023 --> 15:59.157
What is it?
They're going after Dudley.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.027
He said they knew he was here.

16:03.029 --> 16:04.162
VENDELL: Come out
and face us!

16:04.164 --> 16:06.097
Murderer!

16:06.099 --> 16:07.598
Adulterer!

16:11.004 --> 16:12.503
Go home, Vendell.

16:12.505 --> 16:13.738
You're drunk.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.274
All of you, go home!

16:16.276 --> 16:17.675
This is Robert Dudley!

16:17.677 --> 16:18.710
Wife murderer!

16:18.712 --> 16:20.578
I didn't kill my wife.

16:20.580 --> 16:21.713
VENDELL:
Liar. You brought shame

16:21.715 --> 16:23.381
on Our Majesty, the Queen!

16:23.383 --> 16:24.082
You brought shame

16:24.084 --> 16:25.166
on all of England!

16:25.167 --> 16:26.249
Someone should kill him

16:26.252 --> 16:27.452
for what he's done!

16:27.454 --> 16:28.619
I must fetch my guards.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.054
You cannot intercede
on his behalf,

16:30.056 --> 16:31.556
or all of England will know

16:31.558 --> 16:33.591
you've traveled here
to visit him in secret.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.593
You can't afford
more scandal.
Who wants to see me

16:35.595 --> 16:37.562
duel with this murderer?!

16:37.564 --> 16:38.529
(cheering)
To restore honor

16:38.531 --> 16:39.530
to England!

16:39.532 --> 16:41.232
You want fame,
is that it?

16:41.234 --> 16:43.468
You want to write
your name in history.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.403
You either duel with me,

16:45.405 --> 16:48.606
or I'll slaughter you in the
night like the coward you are.

16:51.244 --> 16:54.145
You would hang for killing
an innocent man.

16:54.147 --> 16:56.581
No one in England
thinks you're innocent.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.716
Grab your sword then.

16:58.718 --> 17:01.619
We duel at dawn.

17:05.692 --> 17:06.758
(men cheering)

17:13.066 --> 17:14.298
ELIZABETH:<i> I know</i>
<i> you're a skilled swordsman,</i>

17:14.300 --> 17:16.667
but you do not have to do this.

17:16.669 --> 17:19.070
You think this is the first time
I've been challenged to a duel?

17:19.072 --> 17:20.671
It won't stop.

17:22.609 --> 17:25.676
Even if I don't fight him today,
he'll kill me.

17:25.678 --> 17:27.378
He thinks he can get away
with it, make himself a hero.

17:29.783 --> 17:32.316
At least
if I die today,

17:32.318 --> 17:33.751
I die fighting for your honor.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.387
And mine.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.624
Robert, this is Lady Lola.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.559
There's something
you have to know:

17:41.561 --> 17:44.662
Vendell is using pistols.

17:44.664 --> 17:49.333
What? How often have
you fired a pistol?

17:49.335 --> 17:50.701
LOLA:
You must reconsider.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.403
Guns are terribly
unreliable.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.238
They often misfire.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.107
Even our soldiers
rarely use them in France.

17:56.109 --> 17:57.175
Robert, please.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.276
It's too late now.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.112
There's no
turning back.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.649
Keep your distance,
so you won't be recognized.

18:11.357 --> 18:12.824
Both these weapons are yours.

18:12.826 --> 18:14.759
Surely you'll just choose
the best for yourself.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.695
Of course not.
I'm an honorable man.

18:24.370 --> 18:25.703
It's a matchlock pistol.

18:25.705 --> 18:26.771
You light
the charge on top,

18:26.773 --> 18:28.206
and then whichever
gun ignites

18:28.208 --> 18:29.607
faster fires first.

18:34.314 --> 18:38.216
Please, Lord,
let his fire first.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.398
It's a misfire!

18:59.772 --> 19:02.240
(gasping)

19:02.242 --> 19:04.475
(indistinct chatter)

19:04.477 --> 19:08.279
ELIZABETH: He had to do it.
He was challenged.

19:15.855 --> 19:18.456
CLAUDE:
What's the play about, anyway?

19:18.458 --> 19:20.925
It's a comedy
about the love lives of royals.

19:20.927 --> 19:23.227
I hear the princess
is worth looking at.

19:23.229 --> 19:24.662
Oh.
Shh!

19:24.664 --> 19:26.197
It's starting.
(applause)

19:31.271 --> 19:35.873
Welcome, all,
to the Kingdom of Glory,

19:35.875 --> 19:37.875
where the summers are cool

19:37.877 --> 19:41.579
and the winters fair.

19:41.581 --> 19:45.516
The king and his queen

19:45.518 --> 19:48.819
share a dance
on a midsummer night,

19:48.821 --> 19:50.788
not a worry on their minds,

19:50.790 --> 19:55.293
except who their daughter
will marry.

19:55.295 --> 19:58.930
(light tune playing)

20:03.903 --> 20:06.971
(knocking)

20:07.941 --> 20:09.840
Gideon. Come in.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.876
Sorry to intrude
at such a late hour,

20:11.878 --> 20:14.912
but an offer has just arrived
from Elizabeth.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.816
She's offered to name
you her successor.

20:18.818 --> 20:22.486
If you accept, she will
choose your next husband.

20:22.488 --> 20:24.922
I see.

20:24.924 --> 20:28.993
I know it must feel insulting--

20:28.995 --> 20:30.828
accepting that your best hope
of ruling anything

20:30.830 --> 20:32.830
is to inherit the job
in another country.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.832
It's a large price
to be paid, for sure.

20:35.802 --> 20:38.236
I have lost Scotland.

20:38.238 --> 20:40.238
I am a queen
without a country.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.507
Becoming Elizabeth's successor
offers the possibility

20:43.509 --> 20:45.576
that someday I may rule again.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.845
That possibility protects me.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.815
It will gain me more
supporters. It's not much,

20:50.817 --> 20:53.017
but right now, Gideon,
what other choice do I have?

20:53.019 --> 20:55.987
Well, there's always
another choice.

20:55.989 --> 20:58.589
You work for Elizabeth.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.891
Your queen would benefit
from this.

21:00.893 --> 21:03.794
Shouldn't you be convincing me
to agree?

21:03.796 --> 21:05.630
Don't sign.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.898
If you sign,
you weaken your own position

21:07.900 --> 21:10.801
and become known as the woman
standing behind Elizabeth,

21:10.803 --> 21:13.671
not a queen in your own right.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.973
Then she'll own you,
like she owns me.

21:15.975 --> 21:18.676
You deserve more, Mary.

21:19.846 --> 21:22.046
Why are you being so kind to me?

21:22.048 --> 21:25.950
Sometimes I get tired
of the lies, the...

21:25.952 --> 21:28.352
tactics.

21:28.354 --> 21:31.522
Or maybe I just don't want you
to marry another Englishman.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.328
(door opens)

21:37.330 --> 21:39.597
(lively music plays)

21:41.768 --> 21:43.301
WOMAN:
Finally, our daughter is happy,

21:43.303 --> 21:45.803
and all is as it should be.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.338
(lively music plays)

21:49.609 --> 21:51.542
(horn blows)

21:51.544 --> 21:55.680
MAN: Behold this king and queen
in a new light,

21:55.682 --> 21:57.315
for they have built
this kingdom

21:57.317 --> 22:00.484
on the blood
of their own subjects.

22:00.486 --> 22:04.021
Years ago, 13 Red Knights

22:04.023 --> 22:06.824
valiantly served the royals

22:06.826 --> 22:11.362
only to be falsely accused
of worshipping a demon--

22:11.364 --> 22:12.697
the Baphomet.

22:12.699 --> 22:14.565
And all were executed

22:14.567 --> 22:16.767
by you...

22:16.769 --> 22:18.636
their wicked queen.

22:18.638 --> 22:21.739
Let the kingdom
heed my warning:

22:21.741 --> 22:24.775
The 13 Knights
shall rise again.

22:24.777 --> 22:27.978
The debt shall be paid!

22:27.980 --> 22:29.380
(whispers):
Stop him!

22:38.891 --> 22:41.792
(gasps)
Oh. Arturo, what was that?

22:41.794 --> 22:43.411
It wasn't part of the play.

22:43.412 --> 22:45.029
I tried to go after him,
but he disappeared.

22:48.868 --> 22:52.903
I've never seen
that mask before, I swear it.

22:52.905 --> 22:54.038
Then what happened?
Who was he?

22:54.040 --> 22:55.039
I don't know.

22:55.041 --> 22:56.741
He wasn't one of my players.

22:58.411 --> 22:59.643
He could be anyone.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.687
What the hell was that play,
Stephan?!

23:09.689 --> 23:10.921
Are you trying
to terrorize me?!

23:10.923 --> 23:12.089
What are talking about?

23:12.091 --> 23:13.858
You're dredging up
the past, onstage,

23:13.860 --> 23:14.859
for everyone to see,

23:14.861 --> 23:16.127
for Charles to see.

23:16.129 --> 23:17.862
I have no idea

23:17.864 --> 23:19.730
what Charles saw in the play

23:19.732 --> 23:21.665
because I wasn't there.

23:21.667 --> 23:24.535
I was tracking down
Cardinal Morel,

23:24.537 --> 23:26.637
whose body washed up
on a riverbank,

23:26.639 --> 23:28.139
his throat slit.

23:28.141 --> 23:31.809
He's been dead
for several weeks, at least.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.944
Well, that's convenient,
for someone.

23:33.946 --> 23:37.748
Eh, clearly Morel was killed
to tie up a loose end.

23:37.750 --> 23:38.783
Let me get this straight:

23:38.785 --> 23:40.017
we're looking for someone

23:40.019 --> 23:41.819
with an aversion to loose ends,

23:41.821 --> 23:44.121
a penchant
for terror tactics,

23:44.123 --> 23:46.023
who wouldn't hesitate
to kill a cardinal?

23:46.025 --> 23:47.725
Oh, Catherine.

23:47.727 --> 23:49.894
I know. It's you.
No.

23:49.896 --> 23:52.530
I'm warning you, someone else
is behind these attacks

23:52.532 --> 23:55.032
and whatever nonsense
happened onstage.

23:56.135 --> 23:57.902
I am your ally.

23:57.904 --> 24:00.838
I will never trust you again.

24:02.642 --> 24:03.774
I'm not your wife.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.776
I won't be frightened
into your arms

24:05.778 --> 24:08.212
by a dead rat
or a dead cardinal.

24:11.918 --> 24:13.584
(door opens)

24:14.754 --> 24:16.887
Do you like your new doll,
Agatha?

24:16.889 --> 24:18.522
She's beautiful.

24:18.524 --> 24:19.990
Father?

24:19.992 --> 24:21.525
Mm-hmm?
Queen Mary's nicer

24:21.527 --> 24:24.161
than Queen Elizabeth,
isn't she?

24:24.163 --> 24:25.930
It's hard to say.

24:25.932 --> 24:27.765
By that I mean we shouldn't say.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.567
(knocking)

24:30.837 --> 24:31.902
I have some work to do now.

24:31.904 --> 24:33.204
Why don't you run along
and play?

24:38.778 --> 24:40.478
Gideon, we need to talk.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.780
(door closes)
I just spoke with a spy

24:42.782 --> 24:45.583
in the village who saw
Archbishop Ridolfi last night.

24:46.719 --> 24:47.985
Ridolfi's a
high level enforcer

24:47.987 --> 24:49.620
from the Vatican--
it's strange

24:49.622 --> 24:50.921
he's made no appearance
at French court.

24:50.923 --> 24:52.723
I'm concerned
that he might be here

24:52.725 --> 24:55.793
negotiating with Mary
in secret.

24:55.795 --> 24:57.828
Maybe she lied to us.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.697
Maybe her trip to Rome
wasn't a failure

24:59.699 --> 25:01.932
and she's gathering strength.

25:01.934 --> 25:03.868
How closely have you been
watching her?

25:03.870 --> 25:05.870
As closely as you've been
watching me.

25:07.540 --> 25:09.840
You're not much of a servant
anymore, Jeffrey, are you?

25:09.842 --> 25:11.242
It's me who serves under you.

25:11.244 --> 25:14.011
Elizabeth sent you
to keep an eye on me,

25:14.013 --> 25:16.814
to make sure I do my job:
seduce Mary and control her.

25:16.816 --> 25:17.948
Well, now's the time.

25:17.950 --> 25:19.283
If Mary's actually headed

25:19.285 --> 25:21.752
to Scotland
with a Catholic army,

25:21.754 --> 25:24.655
she could reclaim her throne
and her power.

25:24.657 --> 25:27.925
Do you realize how-how dangerous
this would be to Elizabeth

25:27.927 --> 25:29.860
to have her successor
just beyond the border

25:29.862 --> 25:32.196
with an entire army
at her command?

25:32.198 --> 25:35.933
That's not a successor,
that's a replacement.

25:35.935 --> 25:38.269
This is all theoretical,
we don't know for sure.

25:38.271 --> 25:40.838
But if Mary's
been lying to me,

25:40.840 --> 25:43.307
if she's still working
with Rome, I'll destroy her.

25:43.309 --> 25:44.642
I know you will.

25:45.578 --> 25:47.077
For Agatha's sake.

25:47.079 --> 25:49.280
What did you say?

25:49.282 --> 25:51.282
I know you'll do

25:51.284 --> 25:53.951
whatever it takes.

25:59.158 --> 26:02.026
(door opens, closes)

26:02.028 --> 26:03.561
At least when they called me
a murderer,

26:03.563 --> 26:05.663
I knew it wasn't true.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.899
It's true now.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.668
They will come for you.

26:10.670 --> 26:13.003
I am leaving, and you need
to pull yourself together

26:13.005 --> 26:14.071
and get out of here.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.306
Go north, try Lancashire.

26:15.308 --> 26:17.074
I want to return to court.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.877
My life is there,
my work, Elizabeth.

26:19.879 --> 26:22.046
I can't just roam around
aimlessly forever.

26:22.048 --> 26:25.249
No purpose,
no way to redeem myself.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.017
I don't know that you can
redeem yourself.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.953
Well, I can't
just be this.

26:28.955 --> 26:31.689
I can't just be this
for the rest of my life.

26:31.691 --> 26:34.658
Just the man
who ruined your reputation.

26:35.895 --> 26:37.895
Let me come back to court,
Elizabeth.

26:37.897 --> 26:39.229
I'll face their hatred,

26:39.231 --> 26:40.864
and day by day,
I will do good work,

26:40.866 --> 26:42.700
I'll do
good statesmanship.

26:42.702 --> 26:44.902
Maybe one day I can be more.

26:44.904 --> 26:46.904
No. You're not thinking clearly.

26:46.906 --> 26:48.489
Elizabeth...

26:48.490 --> 26:50.073
You've already received
death threats from court.

26:50.076 --> 26:52.176
If you come back,
they will kill you.
Then so be it.

26:52.178 --> 26:55.913
There's no outrunning
this scandal, Elizabeth.

26:55.915 --> 26:57.915
God knows I've tried.
Robert...

26:57.917 --> 26:59.817
You should go.

26:59.819 --> 27:01.885
(sighs)

27:01.887 --> 27:04.021
I'll await your permission.

27:12.264 --> 27:14.898
(birds chirping)

27:19.639 --> 27:20.971
Queen Mary.

27:22.074 --> 27:23.907
What are you doing here?

27:23.909 --> 27:25.843
I was thinking about the offer
to succeed Elizabeth

27:25.845 --> 27:27.811
as the next Queen of England.

27:27.813 --> 27:29.913
Struggling with whether
to accept or decline.

27:29.915 --> 27:31.315
Then I thought about

27:31.317 --> 27:34.885
what you said--
there is always another choice.

27:36.222 --> 27:39.189
What if we were actually
honest with each another?

27:40.359 --> 27:42.259
I'm not sure I understand.

27:43.663 --> 27:45.896
I lied to you...

27:45.898 --> 27:47.665
about Rome.

27:47.667 --> 27:49.700
The Vatican is
going to support

27:49.702 --> 27:51.101
my return to Scotland.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.103
I was ordered
to keep it a secret

27:53.105 --> 27:54.405
from my enemies, from England.

27:54.407 --> 27:56.674
Why are you telling me this now?

27:56.676 --> 27:58.676
Despite your complicated history
with Elizabeth,

27:58.678 --> 28:01.111
I believe you want
to keep her safe.

28:02.748 --> 28:04.381
I also believe
that you care for me.

28:05.818 --> 28:07.751
Is Elizabeth's safety
in question?

28:07.753 --> 28:10.921
The Vatican wants something
in exchange for their support:

28:10.923 --> 28:12.923
they want me to accept
Elizabeth's offer

28:12.925 --> 28:15.325
and then when I am
named her successor...

28:16.829 --> 28:18.228
...your queen
will be assassinated

28:18.230 --> 28:20.130
and I will take her throne.

28:20.132 --> 28:22.066
I don't want
to kill my cousin,

28:22.068 --> 28:23.867
but I can't say no
to the Vatican.

28:23.869 --> 28:25.469
They alone support me
in my own country.

28:25.471 --> 28:27.705
Without them, I lose my throne.

28:27.707 --> 28:30.274
And I can't tell Elizabeth
what they're planning.

28:30.276 --> 28:31.842
She'd think you were complicit.

28:31.844 --> 28:33.110
That you're only
coming clean now

28:33.112 --> 28:34.344
because something
had gone wrong.

28:34.346 --> 28:35.946
No, she will come after you,

28:35.948 --> 28:36.980
block your return to Scotland.

28:36.982 --> 28:38.182
You see my dilemma.

28:38.184 --> 28:41.018
I'm stuck between England
and Rome,

28:41.020 --> 28:44.121
and I don't know how
to get myself out of this.

28:44.123 --> 28:46.857
What do you want me to do?

28:46.859 --> 28:50.794
First of all,
tell Elizabeth that I said yes.

28:50.796 --> 28:52.429
It will stall the Vatican.

28:52.431 --> 28:54.264
And then?

28:54.266 --> 28:57.367
I'm going to need your help
playing both sides.

28:57.369 --> 29:00.037
If I deal with Rome, and
you deal with Elizabeth,

29:00.039 --> 29:02.106
we might be able
to save her life

29:02.108 --> 29:04.308
without sacrificing my country.

29:06.278 --> 29:08.278
Will you help me, Gideon?

29:09.882 --> 29:11.448
I know it's a risk...

29:11.450 --> 29:13.217
but I have taken a risk

29:13.219 --> 29:15.152
confiding in you.

29:15.154 --> 29:17.254
Don't fight what's between us.

29:17.256 --> 29:20.758
Mary, what's between us
are lies and sabotage.

29:20.760 --> 29:23.427
Relationship born in deceit
often dies there.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.796
There's more between us
than lies.

29:25.798 --> 29:27.431
You know that.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.533
¶ Flowing through my veins ¶

29:29.535 --> 29:34.304
¶ Everything's about to change ¶

29:34.306 --> 29:37.441
¶ Oh, oh ¶

29:37.443 --> 29:41.111
¶ The storm is coming ¶

29:41.113 --> 29:45.983
¶ Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh ¶

29:45.985 --> 29:49.853
¶ The storm is here ¶

29:50.990 --> 29:54.057
¶ I'm here ¶

29:55.795 --> 29:59.229
¶ Oh, oh ¶

29:59.231 --> 30:03.867
¶ The storm is here ¶

30:03.869 --> 30:07.137
¶ Oh-oh-oh ¶

30:07.139 --> 30:13.177
¶ The storm is coming,
coming, coming ¶

30:13.179 --> 30:15.345
¶ Oh-oh-oh ¶

30:15.347 --> 30:19.416
¶ The storm is here. ¶

30:29.128 --> 30:31.295
Gideon, come in.

30:31.297 --> 30:33.363
I'm writing to our queen.

30:33.365 --> 30:35.899
Telling Elizabeth
your suspicions

30:35.901 --> 30:37.501
about Mary meeting
with the Vatican?

30:37.503 --> 30:40.470
Well, clearly Mary's hoping
to gather her army secretly,

30:40.472 --> 30:43.006
to maintain
the element of surprise

30:43.008 --> 30:45.475
when she attempts to reclaim
her throne from the Protestants.

30:45.477 --> 30:48.045
But once we tell Elizabeth
about Mary's plan...

30:48.047 --> 30:49.279
Elizabeth would never let
the Queen of Scots

30:49.281 --> 30:50.914
win back her throne.

30:50.916 --> 30:52.850
Wherever Mary lands
in Scotland,

30:52.852 --> 30:55.052
Elizabeth will alert
the local Protestants,

30:55.054 --> 30:58.488
who will make things
very difficult for her.

30:58.490 --> 30:59.556
Hmm.

30:59.558 --> 31:01.859
Did you see Mary?

31:01.861 --> 31:04.561
No. No, I'm seeing her
later tonight.

31:04.563 --> 31:08.232
So you haven't sent any
word of this to Elizabeth?
No. Not yet.

31:08.234 --> 31:10.434
Gideon, would you fetch me
some more ink?

31:10.436 --> 31:12.302
It's in the trunk
in the corner.

31:30.956 --> 31:33.624
(clanking)

31:33.626 --> 31:36.026
(groaning)

31:38.097 --> 31:40.297
(both groaning)

31:40.299 --> 31:41.565
(grunting)

31:41.567 --> 31:43.133
Gideon?

31:43.135 --> 31:44.368
(grunts)
Gideon!

31:44.370 --> 31:45.469
(yelling)

31:45.471 --> 31:47.170
(grunts)

31:47.172 --> 31:48.372
(sighs)

32:01.387 --> 32:03.487
(door opens)

32:05.524 --> 32:08.425
I've been wanting to speak with
you since the play last night.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.093
(scoffs)
I didn't write the damn thing.

32:10.095 --> 32:11.428
If you didn't like it...

32:11.430 --> 32:13.196
I didn't come here
to critique the piece.

32:13.198 --> 32:14.264
I saw your reaction

32:14.266 --> 32:16.099
to the man in the Baphomet mask.

32:16.101 --> 32:17.367
The queen he described--

32:17.369 --> 32:19.236
that was you, wasn't it?

32:19.238 --> 32:21.004
Bash, it was theater.

32:22.574 --> 32:25.275
When I was a child,
Henry woke me up one night

32:25.277 --> 32:27.210
and took me out
onto the parapet.

32:27.212 --> 32:28.679
He wanted to
show me something.

32:28.681 --> 32:30.981
It's something
I've never forgotten.

32:30.983 --> 32:32.716
The castle grounds were lined
with pikes.

32:32.718 --> 32:35.218
A severed head
on each one.

32:35.220 --> 32:37.688
Each of the men's faces
was painted with a red cross.

32:37.690 --> 32:41.325
Henry said they were soldiers
who'd fallen into devil worship.

32:41.327 --> 32:43.093
There were 13 of them,

32:43.095 --> 32:46.096
just like the man on stage
referred to "13 Red Knights."

32:46.098 --> 32:47.364
I don't remember any such event.

32:47.366 --> 32:49.399
Perhaps you dreamt it.

32:49.401 --> 32:51.435
No. Now, I've come
to realize

32:51.437 --> 32:53.437
the tales I was
told as a child

32:53.439 --> 32:56.306
to describe the horrors
I saw were usually lies.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.475
Why were those soldiers killed,
Catherine?

32:58.477 --> 33:01.111
I don't believe it had anything
to do with devil worship.

33:01.113 --> 33:03.347
I'm surprised you remember.

33:03.349 --> 33:06.450
It was so long ago,
and you were so very young.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.489
We owed them money,

33:12.491 --> 33:14.324
and we could not pay.

33:14.326 --> 33:18.628
It was your father's idea,
but yes, I went along with it.

33:18.630 --> 33:23.367
I said that they should be
executed quietly, but...

33:23.369 --> 33:26.703
Henry-- he insisted that
their heads be put on pikes.

33:26.705 --> 33:30.307
Strike fear, no one will dare
question our actions.

33:30.309 --> 33:33.510
Still, I had the heads
removed before sunrise.

33:35.047 --> 33:36.580
Dear God.

33:36.582 --> 33:39.216
Well, these are the sins
that I live with.

33:39.218 --> 33:41.385
The dead who haunt me.

33:41.387 --> 33:43.320
Bash, whoever took control

33:43.322 --> 33:45.389
of that play must be found.

33:45.391 --> 33:47.224
What if they really
come after me?

33:47.226 --> 33:49.526
If I'm killed,
who will protect Charles?

33:49.528 --> 33:52.396
The realm will be thrown
into chaos.

33:52.398 --> 33:54.297
I understand.

33:55.701 --> 33:58.335
What's strange is
how much time has passed.

33:58.337 --> 34:00.303
They've been dead
for so long.

34:00.305 --> 34:02.105
Are you sure about that?

34:05.744 --> 34:08.178
(door opens)

34:11.350 --> 34:15.185
I was just thinking of you.

34:15.187 --> 34:17.788
Is that blood
on your sleeve? Are you hurt?

34:17.790 --> 34:20.357
Archbishop Ridolfi
needs to be more careful.

34:20.359 --> 34:22.526
Jeffrey learned
he's here in France,

34:22.528 --> 34:24.494
and guessed he was
strategizing with you.

34:24.496 --> 34:26.596
Has Jeffrey told Elizabeth yet?

34:26.598 --> 34:28.832
He never had the chance.

34:28.834 --> 34:32.803
Gideon... where is he now?

34:32.805 --> 34:35.605
Dead... his body in a trunk.

34:35.607 --> 34:38.241
Oh, my God.

34:38.243 --> 34:40.243
He was going
to warn Elizabeth,

34:40.245 --> 34:41.778
and she would not hesitate

34:41.780 --> 34:43.480
to have you ambushed
by the Protestants.

34:43.482 --> 34:46.133
If I did nothing,

34:46.134 --> 34:48.785
you would have lost your chance
to reclaim the Scottish throne.

34:48.787 --> 34:51.488
I finished Jeffrey's letter
in his handwriting,

34:51.490 --> 34:53.390
saying that you've accepted
Elizabeth's offer

34:53.392 --> 34:55.525
of successorship,
and that Jeffrey's on his way

34:55.527 --> 34:56.827
back to English court.

34:56.829 --> 34:59.496
Of course,
he-he'll never make it.

35:01.533 --> 35:04.167
You turned against
your countryman to save me,

35:04.169 --> 35:05.735
my throne, my future.

35:05.737 --> 35:08.105
I haven't turned
against my queen.

35:08.107 --> 35:10.440
Mary...

35:10.442 --> 35:12.642
we must find a way
to save you both.

35:16.482 --> 35:18.315
(sighs)

35:26.458 --> 35:28.458
Queen Elizabeth.

35:28.460 --> 35:31.261
I have returned
to serve at your side.

35:31.263 --> 35:32.829
And serve me you shall.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.764
After much consideration,

35:34.766 --> 35:37.634
I have decided to raise
Robert Dudley's station

35:37.636 --> 35:39.169
to The Earl of Leicester.

35:39.171 --> 35:40.537
He will be granted all

35:40.539 --> 35:42.439
appropriate
lands and titles.

35:42.441 --> 35:44.474
I am humbled.
And I'm not finished.

35:44.476 --> 35:45.675
I have raised
your station

35:45.677 --> 35:47.444
in order
to serve a greater good.

35:47.446 --> 35:48.645
I have named

35:48.647 --> 35:50.647
Queen Mary Stuart
as my successor,

35:50.649 --> 35:53.617
in exchange
for choosing her next husband,

35:53.619 --> 35:55.418
and I choose you.

35:56.588 --> 35:58.288
Mary has accepted these terms

35:58.290 --> 35:59.489
according to a letter
I just received

35:59.491 --> 36:00.690
from our diplomats
at French court.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.659
You will set sail

36:02.661 --> 36:04.294
for France immediately.

36:04.296 --> 36:05.662
This marriage

36:05.664 --> 36:07.764
will provide peace
between our nations.

36:07.766 --> 36:11.234
My Queen, respectfully,

36:11.236 --> 36:13.537
I wish to serve you here
in England.

36:13.539 --> 36:14.905
And I have decided otherwise.

36:14.907 --> 36:16.740
May I request
a private audience?

36:17.576 --> 36:18.542
No.

36:18.544 --> 36:19.776
Your queen has spoken,

36:19.778 --> 36:21.611
and our decision is final.

36:24.683 --> 36:27.450
Now complete your mission.

36:36.595 --> 36:38.628
Elizabeth.

36:38.630 --> 36:41.698
Do not argue with me here
where anyone could see.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.700
How could you do this to me?

36:43.702 --> 36:46.937
Marry me off
to your rival, your enemy?

36:46.939 --> 36:48.939
You know I love you.

36:48.941 --> 36:51.274
I know, and I believe
you will be loyal to me

36:51.276 --> 36:52.275
until the day you die.

36:52.277 --> 36:53.276
Then why?

36:53.278 --> 36:55.278
To save you.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.780
Live in France with her,

36:56.782 --> 37:00.684
live in Scotland,
I don't care, but live.

37:01.787 --> 37:03.853
(voice breaking):
You will always have my heart.

37:07.492 --> 37:10.527
(Elizabeth crying)

37:10.529 --> 37:12.662
(knocking)

37:12.664 --> 37:14.497
Just a moment.

37:14.499 --> 37:16.399
(sniffles, sighs)

37:18.804 --> 37:20.670
Come in.

37:22.674 --> 37:25.408
I just wanted to return this.

37:25.410 --> 37:26.743
The rest of my
luggage arrived,

37:26.745 --> 37:28.645
so I won't be
needing it anymore.

37:28.647 --> 37:31.715
It was very kind of you
to lend it to me.

37:33.885 --> 37:35.752
Do you play chess?

37:35.754 --> 37:36.987
Do you?

37:36.989 --> 37:39.389
I'm quite skilled, actually.

37:39.391 --> 37:41.992
Perhaps we could
play together.

37:47.699 --> 37:51.334
I know we've not yet
discussed personal matters,

37:51.336 --> 37:54.404
but I will tell you something
about my husband.

37:54.406 --> 37:56.973
I receive a letter from him
nearly every day,

37:56.975 --> 37:58.808
and I haven't read one.

37:58.810 --> 38:01.411
They remain unopened
in a pile

38:01.413 --> 38:04.314
because he lied to me,
and I deplore him.

38:04.316 --> 38:06.349
Even so, without him,

38:06.351 --> 38:09.319
the nights are long and lonely.

38:09.321 --> 38:10.820
I can't imagine
what they must be like

38:10.822 --> 38:12.889
without the man you truly love.

38:12.891 --> 38:15.625
Thank you.

38:15.627 --> 38:18.461
Despite your heartbreak,

38:18.463 --> 38:22.299
I must warn you:
I show no mercy.

38:25.070 --> 38:26.403
Lady Lola,

38:26.405 --> 38:28.405
I expect no less.

38:29.574 --> 38:32.642
I think I've discovered
a way to save both

38:32.644 --> 38:34.444
Scotland and my cousin.

38:34.446 --> 38:36.579
I thought is was impossible
to keep the Vatican on my side

38:36.581 --> 38:39.816
without sacrificing Elizabeth,
but I have found an ally.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.651
What lies ahead
is daunting,

38:41.653 --> 38:43.653
but together,
we will get through this.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.922
Together with
the Englishman?

38:45.924 --> 38:48.425
Did you sleep with him?

38:50.662 --> 38:52.395
Yes.

38:52.397 --> 38:56.533
I didn't think I was capable,
but... apparently...

38:56.535 --> 38:57.934
You are.

38:57.936 --> 39:01.104
And now Gideon is on your side.

39:01.106 --> 39:02.806
What about you?

39:02.808 --> 39:04.441
What do you mean?

39:04.443 --> 39:05.942
Why did you do it?

39:05.944 --> 39:09.112
Was it genuine? Were you
giving into temptation?

39:09.114 --> 39:12.382
Or were you seducing him so
you can get out of this alive?

39:12.384 --> 39:15.352
Honestly, Catherine...

39:15.354 --> 39:17.887
I don't know.

39:21.393 --> 39:23.693
¶ ¶

39:26.932 --> 39:29.499
(sighs)

39:29.501 --> 39:33.103
(gasps)
Who's there?

39:33.105 --> 39:35.038
Christophe.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.774
You are supposed
to be in Chambord.

39:37.776 --> 39:39.542
I'm afraid it didn't suit me.

39:39.544 --> 39:40.877
I kept straying from my post.

39:40.879 --> 39:42.779
What? To kill?

39:42.781 --> 39:46.015
I'm worse away from you,
Catherine. I truly am.

39:46.017 --> 39:50.153
(horn blowing)

39:50.155 --> 39:55.024
¶ Headlights a-burn ¶

39:55.026 --> 40:02.699
¶ Take me down
by the altar... ¶

40:02.701 --> 40:03.967
What is that?

40:03.969 --> 40:04.968
The Red Knights.

40:04.970 --> 40:06.703
(man grunts)

40:06.705 --> 40:08.505
Catherine, watch out!

40:09.040 --> 40:10.874
(horn blowing)

40:13.044 --> 40:15.545
¶ How ¶

40:15.547 --> 40:16.646
(horse whinnying)

40:19.484 --> 40:22.886
¶ How ¶

40:26.992 --> 40:28.525
Are you hurt?

40:28.527 --> 40:30.126
I'm all right.

40:30.929 --> 40:33.430
(gasps)

40:33.432 --> 40:37.667
¶ How far in all... ¶

40:37.669 --> 40:38.835

40:38.837 --> 40:40.437
"Your debt will be paid."
