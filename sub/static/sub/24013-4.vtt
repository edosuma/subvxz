00:48.965 --> 00:52.969
Once upon a time, there was a little troll
that lived in a big village, and...

00:54.387 --> 00:56.639
Morning, Guy, Cooper, Smidge.

00:56.723 --> 01:00.810
-You guys trying to hug a cloud again?
-Oh, please. Been there, hugged that.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.521
We're on a bold new quest.

01:03.605 --> 01:05.482
To hug the sun!

01:05.565 --> 01:07.776
So, want to join us, Biggie?

01:07.859 --> 01:08.943
Load faster!

01:09.027 --> 01:12.489
Oh, I don't know.
Sounds a bit risky for my taste.

01:12.572 --> 01:14.282
Again.

01:14.365 --> 01:17.243
Whenever we invite you
to have the slightest bit of fun,

01:17.327 --> 01:18.953
you always say that.

01:19.037 --> 01:20.121
No, I don't.

01:20.205 --> 01:22.082
Hey, Biggie, want to join us?

01:22.165 --> 01:24.209
We're loitering.

01:24.292 --> 01:26.836
Ooh, sounds a bit risky for my taste.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.214
Hey, Biggie, want a sandwich?

01:29.297 --> 01:32.425
It's chunky peanut butter.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.803
Ooh, sounds a bit risky for my taste.

01:34.886 --> 01:37.430
Hey, Biggie,
want to match outfits with us?

01:37.514 --> 01:40.850
We're mixing stripes and plaid.

01:43.812 --> 01:46.439
See, occasionally
I just panic and run away.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.149
Oh, come on.

01:48.233 --> 01:52.112
Sometimes you got to take a risk
if you want to have some fun.

01:52.195 --> 01:53.113
Oh, my Guh,

01:53.196 --> 01:54.656
I'm flying!

01:55.240 --> 01:57.408
Yay!

02:00.995 --> 02:02.997
Oh, my Guh. I'm stuck!

02:03.081 --> 02:05.291
Don't worry.

02:06.292 --> 02:08.127
I got this!

02:17.345 --> 02:20.140
You have really nice eyes.

02:25.436 --> 02:26.813
-That...
-Was...

02:26.896 --> 02:28.189
Amazing!

02:28.273 --> 02:29.524
I'm speechless!

02:30.108 --> 02:31.609
See how speechless I am?

02:31.693 --> 02:34.028
Speechless. Speechless. Speechless!

02:34.112 --> 02:35.488
Meh. I do what I can.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.365
Not you. Gary.

02:37.448 --> 02:40.201
We had no idea
he could do so much fun stuff.

02:40.285 --> 02:41.202
Oh.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.705
Yeah, Gary controls
all kinds of awesome safety gizmos

02:43.788 --> 02:45.081
I hid throughout town.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.376
And he makes brownies.

02:48.459 --> 02:49.919
Ooh!

02:50.920 --> 02:53.381
Uh-uh-uh. Gary's not a toy.

02:53.464 --> 02:56.050
He should only be used in emergencies

02:56.134 --> 02:57.176
and only by me.

02:58.219 --> 03:01.514
Plus, I need to get him home before I head
to Bergentown for the day.

03:01.598 --> 03:04.684
Gristle's throwing a wedding
for his alligator.

03:04.767 --> 03:07.312
Some people are so weird about their pets,

03:07.395 --> 03:08.563
eh, Gar?

03:08.646 --> 03:09.981
Aww.

03:10.064 --> 03:12.108
It was fun at first sight

03:12.191 --> 03:15.778
and then Branch took it away... forever.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.031
Not necessarily.

03:18.114 --> 03:22.327
Not if we borrow Gary
and take him for a little joyride.

03:22.410 --> 03:23.953
- Who's in?
- Yeah!

03:24.037 --> 03:25.663
Oh, bad idea, guys.

03:25.747 --> 03:29.125
You know how protective Branch is
about Gary.

03:29.208 --> 03:32.420
One glitterade for me and one for--

03:32.503 --> 03:33.630
Gary?

03:34.839 --> 03:36.883
I only took my eyes off him for a second!

03:36.966 --> 03:38.134
Gary?

03:39.302 --> 03:40.345
Gary!

03:42.138 --> 03:43.264
Did you take him?

03:43.348 --> 03:44.224
Did you?

03:44.307 --> 03:46.142
Where is he?

03:46.226 --> 03:48.686
Wait. It's okay, everyone.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.563
He was exactly where I left him.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.357
Parenthood.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.983
Am I right?

03:54.067 --> 03:57.070
Oh, we'll have him back
long before Branch gets home.

03:57.153 --> 03:59.322
You know how long alligator weddings take.

03:59.405 --> 04:04.035
Besides, aren't you curious
about those buttons?

04:04.118 --> 04:05.578
Huh, huh?

04:05.662 --> 04:08.331
Uh, maybe I should just get back
to Mr. Dinkles.

04:08.414 --> 04:09.749
His new babysitter is, um--

04:09.832 --> 04:11.251
-I'll take that as a yes!
-Ah!

04:13.086 --> 04:15.004
Branch, what's taking you so long?

04:15.088 --> 04:16.422
We're gonna be late.

04:16.505 --> 04:19.259
Sorry, just finishing wrapping
their wedding present.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.552
You're giving them nunchucks?

04:21.636 --> 04:23.263
What, you got them the same thing?

04:23.346 --> 04:26.641
Come on. I'll explain on the way
why your gift is so wildly inappropriate.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.270
We're in.

04:33.147 --> 04:34.732
I don't know, guys.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.776
Are you sure this is worth the risk?

04:41.864 --> 04:44.158
I got to see a dentist about that.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.493
- Hmm?
- Huh?

04:45.576 --> 04:48.371
Time to find out
what all these buttons do!

04:48.454 --> 04:52.583
Everyone ready for life
to take a turn for the epic?

04:52.667 --> 04:54.127
- Yeah!
- No.

04:54.210 --> 04:55.878
Majority wins!

04:56.879 --> 04:58.965
Ah, tree!

04:59.048 --> 04:59.882
Don't worry.

04:59.966 --> 05:01.634
I think it's this button!

05:04.554 --> 05:07.140
Whoo-hoo!

05:08.766 --> 05:10.018
I'm on it!

05:11.686 --> 05:13.271
Whoopsie-daisy.

05:16.607 --> 05:17.650
Everyone still alive?

05:17.734 --> 05:19.485
Still alive?

05:21.070 --> 05:24.657
I feel like I'm alive for the first time!

05:26.284 --> 05:27.994
Mm?

05:31.372 --> 05:34.250
Motion detector laser grid engaged.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.586
-Hmm?
-Mm-hmm.

05:37.253 --> 05:38.254
Hmm?

05:38.337 --> 05:40.423
Ha!

05:48.056 --> 05:49.557
Safety bubbles deployed.

05:58.816 --> 06:01.527
Cloud Guy defense system initiated.

06:03.404 --> 06:06.908
We're defying the laws of physics!

06:06.991 --> 06:09.660
Super cool smashy thing...

06:09.744 --> 06:12.163
Smashing.

06:16.459 --> 06:17.502
Hug time!

06:17.585 --> 06:18.753
Mmm.

06:18.836 --> 06:20.088
Wait. Another hug time?

06:20.171 --> 06:23.674
That's the fifth one since we took Gary.
We should be getting him back.

06:23.758 --> 06:24.842
Relax.

06:24.926 --> 06:27.178
Branch said he'll be gone all day.

06:27.261 --> 06:30.515
Besides, there's still
one more button to push.

06:30.598 --> 06:33.726
Break glass only in extreme emergency,

06:33.810 --> 06:36.562
because this button is the most extreme.

06:36.646 --> 06:39.190
Come on, Biggie. It's the most extreme!

06:39.273 --> 06:42.151
That's gonna be so much better
than regular extreme.

06:44.028 --> 06:47.281
I'm sure we have time for one more.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.325
Gary, I'm home early.

06:49.408 --> 06:50.576
You won't believe this.

06:50.660 --> 06:54.122
The alligator's bride
left him at the altar.

06:54.205 --> 06:56.290
So guess who gets to keep
these sweet nunchucks.

06:58.209 --> 07:01.212
For the last time, Branch,
stop spinning those things.

07:01.295 --> 07:02.130
Branch?

07:02.213 --> 07:04.382
Huh? Gary?

07:04.465 --> 07:05.383
Gary?

07:05.466 --> 07:06.717
Gary?

07:06.801 --> 07:09.470
Gary!

07:10.888 --> 07:12.890
You want to do the honors, Biggie?

07:12.974 --> 07:14.809
Ooh, jagged glass.

07:14.892 --> 07:17.353
I'm not sure I'm ready for that much risk.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.729
Okay, then!

07:18.813 --> 07:20.022
-Ready?
-Ready.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.190
-Ready.
-Wait!

07:21.899 --> 07:23.151
My butt itches.

07:24.902 --> 07:25.736
Ready.

07:26.737 --> 07:29.490
Emergency escape cart engaged.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.871
Make way!

07:51.596 --> 07:53.389
Cooper, are you okay?

07:53.473 --> 07:55.725
Never better. Why do you ask?

07:58.978 --> 08:00.646
Hi, Bridget!

08:08.988 --> 08:10.698
Oh, my... Gary.

08:10.781 --> 08:13.910
I never knew I could fun like this before!

08:13.993 --> 08:16.120
I know. I can't stop smiling!

08:17.079 --> 08:19.665
Seriously, I think I'm stuck this way.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.335
-Still worth it!
-Indeed!

08:22.418 --> 08:25.087
Can you believe I almost skipped all this

08:25.171 --> 08:27.673
just 'cause I was so afraid
of Branch finding out that--

08:27.757 --> 08:30.009
My remote control was taken!

08:34.639 --> 08:35.890
Oh.

08:35.972 --> 08:39.684
Despite the look on my face,
know that I'm terrified, too.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.270
Branch, calm down!

08:41.354 --> 08:43.940
You probably
just misplaced Gary somewhere.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.441
No, someone took him.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.943
Was it you?

08:47.026 --> 08:48.694
That puffalo couldn't take Gary.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.238
It doesn't have thumbs!

08:52.615 --> 08:54.033
Yeah, he's clean.

08:54.116 --> 08:55.618
But I've got my eye on you.

08:56.911 --> 08:59.622
Branch, you know I'm here to help,

08:59.705 --> 09:02.583
but don't you think you're going
a little overboard with this search?

09:02.667 --> 09:05.586
No. If anything, I'm going underboard.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.505
Underboard? That's not a thing.

09:07.588 --> 09:09.382
Oh, it's a thing.

09:09.465 --> 09:11.342
All right, boys,
here's Gary's scent again.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.306
They've got the trail.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.017
We got to get Gary back to the bunker
without getting caught.

09:20.101 --> 09:22.436
I can slow down those bloodhound bugs.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.397
Double fingers. Do it.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.898
They're over here!

09:30.528 --> 09:31.904
This way!

09:31.988 --> 09:32.989
No, wait!

09:33.072 --> 09:34.615
Over here?

09:35.324 --> 09:36.951
Right. No, left.

09:37.034 --> 09:38.494
No, no, right. Left. Right.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.246
Left!
Right!

09:40.329 --> 09:42.582
It's like they're coming
from all directions!

09:42.665 --> 09:43.958
There's no escape!

09:45.126 --> 09:47.420
Game over, Trolls. Game over!

09:47.503 --> 09:48.462
Biggie was right.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.881
We never should've done any of this!

09:50.965 --> 09:53.092
No, guys. I was wrong.

09:53.175 --> 09:56.178
I took a risk today
and had the time of my life.

09:56.262 --> 09:59.348
Getting out of this
just means taking a few more.

10:01.183 --> 10:03.519
You are my hero.

10:07.106 --> 10:09.442
Give me back my son!

10:09.525 --> 10:12.612
Uh, what he means is,
have you guys seen Gary?

10:12.695 --> 10:14.363
Uh, nope.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.914
That is one brave Troll.

10:23.998 --> 10:24.832
Mm-hmm.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.544
Uh... um....

10:49.732 --> 10:51.233
Aww!

10:51.317 --> 10:52.985
Hmm?

11:06.499 --> 11:07.416
Gary?

11:07.500 --> 11:10.211
Sweet, beautiful Gary!

11:10.294 --> 11:11.128
Huh.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.047
Looks like he was here the whole time.

11:13.130 --> 11:14.673
You don't say.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.717
Parenthood, am I right?

11:20.596 --> 11:22.598
I'm proud of you, buddy.

11:22.681 --> 11:24.725
I didn't know you had that in you.

11:24.809 --> 11:25.768
I do now.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.813
From this day on,
I'm all about taking risks.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.439
In that case...

11:32.024 --> 11:33.734
Want to join me for a little joyride?

11:35.986 --> 11:37.613
Oh, my Guh.

11:37.696 --> 11:38.656
They'll be back.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.032
Giddyup, Mama!

11:48.833 --> 11:52.670
And next on our safari,
we come to Misty Meadows.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.422
- Ooh!
- Whoa!

11:54.505 --> 11:56.924
Here, you'll witness
the forest's broad diversity.

11:57.007 --> 12:00.136
On our right, you'll see
a pair of striped dopplings.

12:02.304 --> 12:04.098
Good. Show me your wild side.

12:04.181 --> 12:06.183
Now do it like you're keeping a secret.

12:06.267 --> 12:09.311
Powerful. Keep it real, but be silly.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.605
Now ferocious. You're an animal!

12:11.689 --> 12:13.023
Wait, wait, wait.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.109
Sorry, this isn't working.

12:15.192 --> 12:17.194
Yeah, stripes are out, man.

12:23.868 --> 12:24.994
What's that for, DJ?

12:25.077 --> 12:28.581
Sampling sounds
for an experimental album I'm working on.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.796
Eh, it's a work in progress!

12:35.880 --> 12:38.591
Looks like our doppling
has found some purfles,

12:38.674 --> 12:41.760
a rare delicacy
exclusive to Misty Meadows.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.762
Delicacy? Exclusive?

12:46.765 --> 12:47.850
Guy, did you just eat one?

12:47.933 --> 12:50.644
I told you we're not supposed
to disrupt the habitat.

12:50.728 --> 12:53.189
Plus, they cause massive indigestion.

12:53.272 --> 12:54.356
Branch.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.442
I swear, I didn't eat--

13:05.284 --> 13:07.411
Glitter farts--my greatest gift...

13:08.412 --> 13:10.039
...and my greatest curse.

13:10.122 --> 13:13.292
Come on, guys, we promised Branch
that we would keep our hands to ourselves.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.335
Yes, that's right.

13:14.418 --> 13:16.962
'Cause when we interfere with nature
we know nothing about,

13:17.046 --> 13:18.631
we risk destabilizing it.

13:18.714 --> 13:20.216
Understood?

13:20.299 --> 13:22.426
Kitties!

13:22.510 --> 13:24.762
Must pet them!

13:32.853 --> 13:34.730
They're living in squalor.

13:34.813 --> 13:36.315
It's so sad...

13:36.398 --> 13:37.441
Dorable.

13:37.525 --> 13:40.903
We got to give them a good home,
don't we, Poppy?

13:40.986 --> 13:42.655
-Well...
-Poppy, no.

13:42.738 --> 13:44.698
My wilderness guide is very clear.

13:44.782 --> 13:47.409
This is where the swampkins belong.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.495
We have to leave them alone.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.497
Leave them alone?

13:59.588 --> 14:01.507
Gah! I don't care what the guide says!

14:01.590 --> 14:04.260
I won't stand by
while swampkins starve in a muddy pit

14:04.343 --> 14:05.844
like Branch wants them to!

14:05.928 --> 14:06.845
I never said--

14:06.929 --> 14:09.014
I vow, from this day forward,

14:09.098 --> 14:11.809
they'll have a good home, our home!

14:11.892 --> 14:14.645
Everyone,
grab some to take back to your pods.

14:17.314 --> 14:21.902
Aww, I can feel my heart
bubbling inside me.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.739
Nope, not my heart.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.370
Aww!

14:31.453 --> 14:33.330
So cute.

14:33.414 --> 14:34.456
Horrifying.

14:34.540 --> 14:38.210
Poppy, you're toying with forces of nature
you can't possibly understand.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.963
Do you even realize
the ramifications of your actions?

14:41.046 --> 14:43.716
Not really. Why don't you tell me?

14:43.799 --> 14:46.927
Well, this thing isn't super organized,

14:47.011 --> 14:49.471
but, trust me,
it's a long list of eco-disasters.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.557
Such as?

14:51.640 --> 14:52.892
Do you--

14:52.975 --> 14:54.268
I--

14:54.351 --> 14:55.227
But--

14:56.228 --> 14:57.479
You're so annoying.

14:57.563 --> 14:58.647
You know you like it.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.567
Aww.

15:01.650 --> 15:03.569
I've got to scrapbook this.

15:03.652 --> 15:04.486
Careful there.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.155
Don't want to step on you cuties.

15:06.238 --> 15:07.072
Whoop.

15:07.156 --> 15:07.990
Oh. Okay.

15:09.366 --> 15:10.492
Getting...

15:10.576 --> 15:12.328
...kind of hard to walk here.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.621
Just trying...

15:13.704 --> 15:16.081
to chronicle... cuteness!

15:18.459 --> 15:20.586
Okay, fine, no scrapbooking.

15:20.669 --> 15:22.755
Ah, you little heart-melters.

15:25.007 --> 15:29.553
You know, after a while, that cute meow
starts to sound kind of shrill.

15:32.723 --> 15:33.933
What?

15:34.016 --> 15:36.060
Do you want water?

15:36.143 --> 15:38.103
A ball?

15:38.187 --> 15:39.939
A scratch?

15:40.022 --> 15:41.148
A bathroom?

15:41.899 --> 15:43.817
Wardrobe change?

15:43.901 --> 15:46.320
What?

15:46.403 --> 15:48.739
What do you want?

15:48.822 --> 15:50.324
That's it!

15:50.407 --> 15:53.202
You are going for a walk
till this is out of your system!

15:54.411 --> 15:57.331
Well?

15:57.414 --> 15:59.333
You guys worn out yet?

16:04.338 --> 16:07.591
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

16:16.392 --> 16:18.394
What am I doing wrong?

16:18.477 --> 16:21.146
How is everyone
making this work except me?

16:21.230 --> 16:22.481
Poppy!

16:26.151 --> 16:28.946
The swampkins must go back.

16:29.029 --> 16:32.408
But, guys, we can't send them
back to that swamp.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.827
I vowed to give them
a good home, remember?

16:35.661 --> 16:36.829
Unless...

16:39.206 --> 16:42.167
You know, Gary, whenever Poppy
does something that drives me nuts,

16:42.251 --> 16:45.045
nothing calms me down
quite like bird watching.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.755
There's one now.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.425
I'm watching you, bird.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.218
- Okay, little ones.
- Huh?

16:51.301 --> 16:54.346
Who's ready to see their new home?

16:55.556 --> 16:56.974
Poppy, what are you doing?

16:57.057 --> 16:59.852
Oh, hey, Branch.

16:59.935 --> 17:01.562
How are you?

17:01.645 --> 17:03.105
Feeling open-minded?

17:03.188 --> 17:04.606
Not especially, no.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.608
Uh, well, then you probably
don't want to hear

17:07.693 --> 17:10.654
how we moved the swampkins
out of Troll Village.

17:10.738 --> 17:13.198
Oh! That's great. About time.

17:13.281 --> 17:15.659
And gave their habitat a makeover.

17:15.742 --> 17:16.827
You what?

17:18.244 --> 17:21.290
Oh, well, at least it doesn't look
like you changed much.

17:21.373 --> 17:22.374
No, it doesn't,

17:22.458 --> 17:24.251
'cause that's the "before" picture.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.047
You didn't!

17:40.392 --> 17:42.019
Poppy, this is a catastrophe!

17:42.102 --> 17:42.936
The guide says--

17:43.020 --> 17:45.230
I already know
what the guide says, Branch,

17:45.314 --> 17:47.483
that I interfered with nature again.

17:47.566 --> 17:48.442
But so what?

17:48.525 --> 17:50.527
All the swampkins are doing great.

17:55.282 --> 17:56.450
And look!

17:56.533 --> 17:58.535
Even some of their neighbors
came by to play.

18:01.538 --> 18:04.124
Hey, little guys, aren't you so cute?

18:07.878 --> 18:10.589
Those are grossums.
They prey on swampkins.

18:10.672 --> 18:11.965
"Grossums have bad eyesight,

18:12.049 --> 18:15.385
so swampkins stay safe by blending in
with their muddy habitats."

18:15.469 --> 18:19.181
Unless an overzealous, pink-haired Troll
decides to shine a giant light on them

18:19.264 --> 18:22.184
despite her wise and handsome friend's
repeated warnings!

18:22.267 --> 18:23.352
You're so annoying!

18:23.435 --> 18:24.686
You know you like it!

18:26.146 --> 18:27.898
Flee, swampkins! Flee!

18:36.323 --> 18:37.407
Look!

18:37.491 --> 18:39.368
They don't like the lazy river. Ha!

18:39.451 --> 18:41.036
"Fact--grossums can't swim,

18:41.120 --> 18:43.080
so the swampkins build moats
for protection."

18:43.163 --> 18:44.414
The swampkins are saved!

18:52.089 --> 18:55.342
Protect the swampkins! Form a hair-icade!

18:58.637 --> 19:01.056
Ha! Nice work, gang! They're retreating!

19:01.140 --> 19:02.141
Yeah!

19:02.224 --> 19:04.393
Or they're doing their buzz saw attack.

19:05.894 --> 19:07.354
I'm guessing the latter!

19:07.437 --> 19:08.272
Ah!

19:08.355 --> 19:10.440
Guys, if we all die,

19:10.524 --> 19:12.067
I just want to say...

19:12.151 --> 19:14.611
could you scream into the microphone
for my album?

19:17.698 --> 19:19.116
Okay, Branch, I admit it.

19:19.199 --> 19:21.451
I got us into this
by interfering with nature.

19:21.535 --> 19:25.080
But is there anything in your guide
that can help us get out of this mess?

19:26.165 --> 19:27.332
Hello?

19:27.416 --> 19:30.002
Oh. Sorry.
It's so rare you admit you're wrong.

19:30.085 --> 19:31.003
Branch!

19:31.086 --> 19:32.754
Right, okay. Um...

19:32.838 --> 19:33.797
Yes!

19:33.881 --> 19:35.883
It says grossums can be tamed by music!

19:35.966 --> 19:37.134
Perfect!

19:37.217 --> 19:38.677
DJ, drop a beat!

20:03.869 --> 20:05.954
Uh, they don't seem
to like the island sound.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.123
Does it say what kind of music
they do like?

20:08.207 --> 20:10.876
Hmm. On this, the guide is silent.

20:10.959 --> 20:12.377
Fantastic.

20:12.461 --> 20:15.339
Okay, guys, this is gonna take
a little trial and error.

20:15.422 --> 20:17.716
Watch me for the changes
and try to keep up.

20:28.435 --> 20:29.478
Let me try.

20:36.985 --> 20:37.819
We got this.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.788
Ooh! My turn.

21:18.318 --> 21:21.154
Okay, they want to kill me.

21:21.238 --> 21:24.449
Zydeco music just whips them
into a bloodthirsty frenzy.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.451
And I don't blame you, grossums!

21:28.120 --> 21:29.246
So twangy.

21:32.749 --> 21:35.460
It's now or never!
We have to do something!

21:35.544 --> 21:36.461
Do what?

21:36.545 --> 21:38.588
We've practically tried
every kind of music there is.

21:38.672 --> 21:41.425
Not every kind.

21:41.508 --> 21:44.720
DJ, hit me with that sweet cacophony!

21:52.602 --> 21:55.063
Ha ha, it's working!

21:55.147 --> 21:56.023
Crank it up!

22:06.241 --> 22:08.285
-Think they'll find their way back?
-Doubt it.

22:08.368 --> 22:11.788
Like the guide said, bad eyesight.

22:11.872 --> 22:14.666
Well, we put it back to normal.

22:16.168 --> 22:21.006
Yeah, but they're still looking at us
like the sun has died and it's our fault.

22:21.089 --> 22:22.007
What gives?

22:22.090 --> 22:24.217
Maybe that's their happy face?

22:24.301 --> 22:25.886
-Uh...
-Maybe.

22:25.969 --> 22:27.387
I don't know.

22:27.471 --> 22:29.723
Sometimes I don't get
Mother Nature at all,

22:29.806 --> 22:32.309
which is when it's better
to leave her alone.

22:33.310 --> 22:34.603
Aww.

22:34.686 --> 22:38.732
And that's when something
really adorable can happen.
