We're on vacation.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.661
Yo.
This game's layered, man.

04:27.934 --> 04:31.335
Where you going, Portman?
I'm going down to El Honto...

04:31.404 --> 04:34.168
and I'm gonna lock myself
in a motel room...

04:34.240 --> 04:37.266
with a bottle of tequila
and three she-boys.

04:39.545 --> 04:40.978
You're sick, man.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.584
I'm sick of your filth,
Portman.
He speaks.

04:48.921 --> 04:50.047
What's it gonna be, Reaps?

04:50.123 --> 04:51.590
An armed conflict
someplace quiet?

04:51.658 --> 04:55.059
Yeah, a little relaxing
jungle warfare?

04:55.895 --> 04:57.522
Or maybe you're just gonna
stay right here.

04:57.597 --> 04:59.087

Got a problem with that, Duke?

05:12.211 --> 05:14.509
Me, Sarge?
Hell, no, I love my job.

05:14.580 --> 05:16.810

We got us a game.

05:34.934 --> 05:38.461

Shut up, Portman.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.399
Not this time, John.
What?

05:43.142 --> 05:45.940
We can handle this one.
You're bullshitting me.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.808
No, I'm not bullshitting.
We're going to Olduvai.

05:52.218 --> 05:53.207
Olduvai?

05:58.124 --> 06:00.684
Take the leave.
Is that an order?

06:01.828 --> 06:03.693
It's a recommendation.

06:04.831 --> 06:06.526
See you when I get back.

07:53.506 --> 07:55.974
We have a quarantine situation
on Olduvai.

07:56.042 --> 07:57.168
They sent this message...

Why can't UAC rent-a-cops
take care of this bullshit?

12:37.923 --> 12:39.686
Is it always that rough?

12:39.759 --> 12:42.159
Believe me,
it used to be a lot rougher.

12:42.595 --> 12:46.258
There was a time when
Ark travel was susceptible
to, let's say...

12:46.332 --> 12:49.130
major turbulence.
What's he mean?

12:49.702 --> 12:53.194
He means he went
to one galaxy,
his ass went to another.

12:55.141 --> 12:57.735
Call it
a scientific miscalculation.

12:58.277 --> 13:02.543

14:13.185 --> 14:15.415
When can I start
evacuating people out
through the Ark?

14:15.487 --> 14:17.887
We're at a Level 5 quarantine,
nobody goes anywhere.

14:17.957 --> 14:22.223
Ladies, we're under
a Level 5 quarantine...

14:22.294 --> 14:25.821

strip search you girls.

14:25.898 --> 14:28.890
I don't think so.
Hold that thought.

14:28.968 --> 14:32.028
We're under
a Level 5 quarantine,

14:32.104 --> 14:33.833
to strip...

14:33.906 --> 14:36.739
Sergeant,
this is Dr. Samantha Grimm,
the UAC science officer...

14:36.809 --> 14:38.902
assigned to retrieve data
from the lab.

14:38.978 --> 14:41.037
Sergeant.
Dr. Grimm.

14:41.113 --> 14:43.547
Hello, John.
Hello, Samantha.

14:43.616 --> 14:45.049
Hello, Samantha!

14:45.951 --> 14:47.851
Sarge,
this operation is a code red.

14:47.920 --> 14:50.047
We really don't have room
for passengers.

14:50.122 --> 14:53.580
Excuse me, but I have orders
to retrieve data
from three servers:

14:53.659 --> 14:56.924
Anthropology,
Forensic Archeology,
and Genetics.

14:57.029 --> 14:59.224
This is a military operation,
Doctor.

14:59.298 --> 15:02.358
We're really not here
to retrieve
your science homework.

15:02.434 --> 15:06.200
Look, I got an idea.
Why don't you ask your CO
what your orders are?

15:08.874 --> 15:11.672
To contain
and neutralize the threat,
protect the civilians...

15:11.744 --> 15:15.578
and retrieve...
retrieve UAC property.

15:16.148 --> 15:19.015
We finally done here?
Because I've got a job to do.

15:19.318 --> 15:21.946
If you'll follow me?
You chose this, Reaper.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.955
Is this gonna spoil my day?
No, sir.

15:26.025 --> 15:28.186
Tell me you didn't let
a fine-looking piece of ass...

15:28.260 --> 15:30.455
like that get away from you,
Reaper.
She's my sister.

15:30.529 --> 15:32.520
No shit?
Don't do this again, man.

15:32.598 --> 15:33.587
Do what?

15:34.066 --> 15:36.534
There's three sections
to Carmack's lab complex.

15:36.602 --> 15:39.036
Archeology, Genetics,
and Weapons Research.

15:39.104 --> 15:41.072
You test weapons up here?
Well, it's a dead planet.

15:41.140 --> 15:44.041
You want that stuff
tested here, where it's safe,
or in your own backyard?

15:44.109 --> 15:46.577
We're primarily
an archeological operation.

15:46.645 --> 15:49.113
Weapons Research is in
its own separate facility.

15:49.181 --> 15:51.581
It has nothing to do
with Dr. Carmack's work.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.311
How many inside
when the lab shut down?

15:53.385 --> 15:55.979
Only Dr. Carmack's team.
That's six people.

15:56.055 --> 15:58.956
In one of the carbon dating
labs, there was
an internal phone...

15:59.024 --> 16:00.150
left off the hook.

16:00.225 --> 16:02.489
Did you get any information
from it?

16:10.736 --> 16:11.998
Open the door.

16:22.548 --> 16:24.778
Portman, Goat, lead on.

16:33.058 --> 16:35.618
Magnesium, chromium, lead.
It's all normal.

16:35.694 --> 16:37.025
All clear.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.694
Pinky, give us a schematic.

16:43.736 --> 16:45.533
Uploading to you now.

16:49.441 --> 16:51.932
<i>Carmack's lab is isolated</i>
<i>from the rest of the facility.</i>

16:52.811 --> 16:55.177
<i>The airlock is the only way</i>
<i>in or out.</i>

16:58.584 --> 17:00.051
Goat, Portman: Genetics.

17:00.119 --> 17:03.213
Kid, Destroyer:
Carmack's office,
where he sent the mayday from.

17:03.288 --> 17:06.086
Reaper, keep Dr. Grimm here
safe on her salvage op.

17:06.157 --> 17:10.151
Duke and I'll take
the weapons lab, make sure
all the hardware's secure.

17:10.229 --> 17:11.890
Be safe, gentlemen.

17:12.364 --> 17:14.457
Portman, Goat, on you.
It's on.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.775
Clear left.
Clear right.

17:33.385 --> 17:37.617
$5 says this shit ain't
nothing but a disgruntled
employee with a gun.

17:39.758 --> 17:42.886
Fluorescent markings
as rooms are cleared. Go.

17:48.834 --> 17:50.597
They're on the move.

17:52.704 --> 17:54.535
You don't look like a "Mac."

17:55.774 --> 17:58.402
Katsuhiko Kumanosuke Takaashi.

18:00.012 --> 18:01.502
So, Mac.

18:52.564 --> 18:53.826
What the fuck!

19:14.119 --> 19:16.519
Pinky, you getting this?

19:16.622 --> 19:17.782
Jesus.

19:17.856 --> 19:19.255
<i>Very cool.</i>

19:48.086 --> 19:49.075
Cleared.

19:50.422 --> 19:52.652
Where the hell is everybody?

19:55.494 --> 19:56.483
Hey.

20:11.710 --> 20:12.699
Lock in.

20:20.519 --> 20:21.713
It's clear.

20:24.790 --> 20:26.655
How much time you gonna need?

20:26.725 --> 20:28.659
Thirty minutes, tops.

20:29.194 --> 20:30.821
<i>Goat, Portman.</i>

20:30.896 --> 20:32.727
There's another room
to the north.

20:32.798 --> 20:34.390
<i>Past Genetics.</i>

20:35.934 --> 20:37.162
Copy that.

20:55.687 --> 20:58.588
What the hell is that?
You never did time, Portman?

20:58.657 --> 20:59.646
What?

21:01.827 --> 21:05.695
This is a holding cell.
Bullshit.

21:06.398 --> 21:08.127
What makes you think that?

21:10.068 --> 21:11.057
Touch it.

21:15.540 --> 21:19.670
'Cause the walls
are electrified.
You asshole!

21:25.484 --> 21:28.146
Jeez. They leave shit
like this lying around?

21:29.655 --> 21:32.180
I'd hate to see
what they lock up.

21:41.800 --> 21:42.789
"BFG."

21:46.738 --> 21:49.434
Hey, Sarge, what's the deal
with the sister?

21:52.644 --> 21:55.408
Reaper's parents
led the first team
of archeologists to Olduvai.

21:55.480 --> 21:58.108
They died in some accident
when he was a kid.

22:00.786 --> 22:03.482
She followed in their
footsteps, and he didn't.

22:03.755 --> 22:07.122
No, what I meant was,
is she single?

22:12.230 --> 22:14.357
<i>Please provide</i>
<i>DNA verification.</i>

22:19.071 --> 22:21.198
<i>Access denied.</i>

22:57.676 --> 22:59.371
All units report contact.

23:00.011 --> 23:02.138
<i>God damn it,</i>
<i>all units report contact.</i>

23:02.714 --> 23:03.703
Hey.

23:06.785 --> 23:08.377
It was moving.

23:08.487 --> 23:11.047
<i>Friendly fire, Sarge.</i>
<i>Wasting ghosts.</i>

23:11.456 --> 23:13.424
Roger that. Funny, Duke.

23:14.659 --> 23:17.457
So, "Reaper"? As in "Grim"?

23:18.096 --> 23:20.155
They're Marines, Sam,
not poets.

23:20.999 --> 23:22.489
Holy shit!

23:23.635 --> 23:25.068
Oh, yeah, meet Lucy.

23:25.170 --> 23:26.831
Lucy, this is my brother,
John...

23:26.905 --> 23:28.873
another creature
from the long lost past.

23:28.940 --> 23:31.636
You found human remains?
Humanoid.

23:31.710 --> 23:34.270
Lucy and her child
were our first major find.

23:34.346 --> 23:36.473
We're bringing out more
every day.

23:37.849 --> 23:41.717
You re-opened the dig?
I know I should have told you.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.078
I didn't figure it was
the sort of thing...

23:44.156 --> 23:46.647
I could jot down on
a yearly birthday card.

23:47.025 --> 23:49.050
It's been stabilized.
Bullshit.

23:49.494 --> 23:52.463
You wanna talk about safe?
Like you took a desk job?

23:54.132 --> 23:57.158
I'm a forensic archeologist,
John. I'll go where
the work is.

23:57.235 --> 23:59.328
Is that the only reason
you're up here?

23:59.404 --> 24:01.395
You wanna know
why I'm up here?

24:02.374 --> 24:04.137
I'll show you. Come here.

24:06.244 --> 24:09.304
This is Lucy's chromosome
profile. Notice anything?

24:10.615 --> 24:12.981
My molecular genetics
is a little rusty.

24:13.185 --> 24:15.983
What's the first thing
Dad taught us to look for?

24:23.261 --> 24:25.559
She's got 24 pairs
of chromosomes.

24:25.630 --> 24:29.122
Humans only have 23.
But what does
the extra pair do?

24:29.201 --> 24:30.793
Makes her superhuman.

24:30.936 --> 24:32.995
The extra pair makes
her super strong...

24:33.071 --> 24:35.505
super fit, super intelligent.

24:35.774 --> 24:38.368
Her cells divide
50 times faster...

24:38.443 --> 24:40.843
meaning she heals
almost instantly.

24:41.413 --> 24:44.109
The fossil record
indicates these people
had conquered disease.

24:44.182 --> 24:47.413
We found no genetic disorders,
no viruses, no cancers.

24:47.486 --> 24:50.011
So what, they were just
naturally superior?

24:50.589 --> 24:52.147
No. Not naturally.

24:52.724 --> 24:55.693
See, the earliest remains
we found only had 23.

24:56.428 --> 24:59.226
We suspect this extra
chromosome may be synthetic.

24:59.564 --> 25:00.826
Bioengineered?

25:01.800 --> 25:03.825
That's a long word
for a Marine.

25:04.836 --> 25:05.962
Does it ever bother you...

25:06.037 --> 25:08.062
you could've spent your life
looking in a microscope...

25:08.139 --> 25:09.766
instead of a sniper scope?

25:12.377 --> 25:15.244
If they were so smart,
how come they're so dead?

25:16.348 --> 25:17.610
We don't know.

25:18.483 --> 25:20.644
Maybe they just went
with time.

25:21.786 --> 25:24.050
You don't shield a baby
from time.

25:26.458 --> 25:28.187
<i>We got movement up ahead.</i>

25:29.561 --> 25:31.791
You stay here, okay?
Lock the door.

25:42.440 --> 25:44.567
Fucking door has
been ripped open.

25:44.976 --> 25:47.570
There's something
in Carmack's office.

26:42.534 --> 26:43.523
There!

26:45.937 --> 26:47.063
Contact!

26:47.138 --> 26:49.971
<i>Moving east through</i>
<i>Carmack's office! Fast!</i>

26:52.777 --> 26:56.008
<i>Confirmed contact. Moving</i>
<i>fast, over south corridor.</i>

26:56.648 --> 26:57.979
Hold your fire!

27:07.993 --> 27:10.894
If you have a weapon, drop it.

27:15.300 --> 27:16.426
Don't move.

27:28.146 --> 27:31.343
Sam, I told you to stay...
But he knows me, John.

27:31.916 --> 27:34.578
Dr. Carmack, it's me.
Samantha.

27:35.220 --> 27:38.553
Where are the others?
Where are they?

27:38.623 --> 27:40.454
Steve, Hillary...

27:41.459 --> 27:43.188
I'm not gonna hurt you.

27:45.597 --> 27:47.326
I'm not gonna hurt you.

27:48.967 --> 27:50.161
Ah!

27:52.404 --> 27:53.530
Jesus Christ!

27:53.605 --> 27:55.937
Oh, damn.
Get a med kit.

27:56.007 --> 27:57.133
Nice.

27:57.542 --> 27:59.635
I'm not gonna hurt you.

27:59.711 --> 28:01.679
Duke, get him to the infirmary
with Dr. Grimm.

28:01.746 --> 28:04.738
Portman, Kid, go to
the airlock and dig in.

28:05.417 --> 28:08.978
Anything trying to get away
from us will get driven
straight to you.

28:11.723 --> 28:15.352
Now let's see
if we can find the body
that goes with that arm.

28:19.397 --> 28:21.262
It's messed up, huh?

28:23.435 --> 28:24.925
Guy like Carmack...

28:25.570 --> 28:28.198
who's trained to put logic
before emotion...

28:28.840 --> 28:31.104
he's so freaked, huh...

28:31.176 --> 28:33.576
he tears off his own ear?

28:34.879 --> 28:36.176
I tell you, man.

28:37.048 --> 28:40.381
It's shit like that
that gets under your skin.

28:48.259 --> 28:49.248
Do you...

28:54.099 --> 28:57.535
Do you have any?
Do I have any?

29:03.641 --> 29:04.630
What?

29:07.245 --> 29:08.234
You know.

29:10.115 --> 29:11.343
I'm just a little shook up.

29:11.416 --> 29:13.350
I need something
to get my focus, man.

29:13.418 --> 29:15.613
My game face.

30:18.216 --> 30:19.683
God damn it!

30:51.883 --> 30:53.714
I took His name in vain.

31:20.778 --> 31:22.803
Shit.

31:29.587 --> 31:32.420
There is a God.

31:55.446 --> 31:56.743
Ma'am.

31:57.982 --> 31:59.244
Excuse me, ma'am.

32:11.296 --> 32:12.786
Sarge...

32:13.965 --> 32:15.899
I think we found
the rest of that arm.

32:26.377 --> 32:28.470
No, no.

32:28.813 --> 32:32.180
No, no, I don't do nanowalls.
Yes, you do.

32:36.821 --> 32:39.551
You got him? Wait here.

32:41.292 --> 32:42.281
Shit.

33:00.311 --> 33:01.437
Two, three.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.469
You okay?

33:03.581 --> 33:05.481
Did they find the others?
Not yet.

33:05.550 --> 33:07.882
My husband is with them.

33:09.220 --> 33:10.983
I'm sure Steve's fine.

33:12.690 --> 33:15.557
Dr. Carmack, I'm going to
take your blood pressure.

33:20.398 --> 33:23.162
Hey...
It's okay, it's okay.

33:24.469 --> 33:26.869
I can feel it.
What happened in there?

33:27.972 --> 33:30.805
Shut it, shut it down.
Shut it down.

33:38.349 --> 33:39.680
S-Shut it down.

33:43.287 --> 33:44.447
It's inside.

33:46.491 --> 33:47.924
<i>We heard something</i>
<i>in Genetics.</i>

33:47.992 --> 33:49.118
<i>We're re-entering.</i>

33:49.193 --> 33:51.684
<i>That's affirmative, Reaper.</i>

33:57.101 --> 33:58.932
Looks like
we missed the party.

33:59.003 --> 34:00.732
We were just here.

34:02.740 --> 34:04.833
What happened
to all the animals?

34:27.764 --> 34:30.255
Sir, RRTS. We're here to help.

34:33.036 --> 34:34.800
Sir, are you okay?

34:36.306 --> 34:37.295
Okay.

34:40.478 --> 34:42.309
No, no, no. Sir, put it down.

34:46.818 --> 34:48.409
<i>Contact report.</i>

34:48.485 --> 34:49.475
Damn it.

34:50.154 --> 34:52.213
<i>We found another</i>
<i>one of the scientists.</i>

34:52.290 --> 34:54.315
<i>Some weird shit</i>
<i>going on here, Sarge.</i>

34:54.391 --> 34:57.828
Can you ID him?
We got a Dr. Olsen.

34:59.263 --> 35:02.255
He rushed us. Crazy.
Just like Carmack.

35:02.333 --> 35:04.597
Is he dead?
<i>Yeah, very.</i>

35:04.669 --> 35:07.103
<i>Should we bag him and tag him?</i>
Negative.

35:07.171 --> 35:09.264
Continue your search.

35:10.908 --> 35:11.897
Sarge?

36:10.034 --> 36:12.002
What was that?
A monkey.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.865
Some kind of monkey.

36:35.226 --> 36:36.693
Oh, my God.

36:37.862 --> 36:40.160
There's something
in his blood.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.893
What's happening to him?

36:58.916 --> 37:01.976
Move, move, move.
I got him.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.214
Clear!
Go, go, go.

37:06.123 --> 37:08.990
<i>Reaper, what have you got?</i>
We're chasing something.

37:09.060 --> 37:12.257
What do you mean, something?
Something big, not human.

37:12.330 --> 37:13.297
God damn it!

37:13.364 --> 37:14.922
Give me a confirmation
on what you're seeing.

37:14.999 --> 37:16.899
Reaper.
It's in the sewer.

37:18.269 --> 37:19.759
All units, all units.

37:19.837 --> 37:21.828
Southeast corridor
near the med lab.

37:25.843 --> 37:27.310
And I thought
"being in the shit"

37:27.378 --> 37:28.572
was a figure of speech.

37:28.646 --> 37:31.137
Get in the goddamn hole,
Portman.

37:36.554 --> 37:38.920
I can handle things here.
You should go.

37:39.323 --> 37:42.815
I want to stay.
Steve is gonna be okay.

37:44.629 --> 37:47.393
The guys looking for him
are the best.

37:48.466 --> 37:51.435
Go on, go on.
Be with your daughter.

37:51.736 --> 37:52.828
Thank you.

38:01.345 --> 38:02.710
What's going on?

38:05.583 --> 38:08.575
"No blood match."
Can't be good, right?

38:10.187 --> 38:12.052
This is crazy.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.525
Oh, my God!

38:23.634 --> 38:25.761
<i>Tunnel ahead</i>
<i>is the main junction.</i>

38:25.870 --> 38:27.804
<i>It leads back</i>
<i>under the lab complex.</i>

38:27.872 --> 38:30.340
Destroyer, cover the exit.

39:28.499 --> 39:29.989
We got a Dr. Willits.

39:30.534 --> 39:31.796
Steve Willits.

39:34.605 --> 39:35.765
Move out.

39:52.056 --> 39:53.887
"Be sober, be vigilant...

39:54.358 --> 39:56.292
"because your adversary,
the devil...

39:56.360 --> 39:58.920
"walketh about seeking
whom he may devour."

40:00.898 --> 40:02.695
That's real comforting, Goat.

40:02.767 --> 40:04.928
That ain't
freaking me out at all.

40:08.706 --> 40:10.571
Portman!
What the fuck?

40:11.509 --> 40:12.601
Go, go.

40:13.043 --> 40:15.204
Wait! Somebody's down there.
Come on.

40:15.980 --> 40:17.140
Grab an arm.

40:17.214 --> 40:18.511
Goddamn son of a bitch
is heavy!

40:18.582 --> 40:19.571
Hang on.

40:20.518 --> 40:22.145
Quick, he's slipping back.

40:22.420 --> 40:23.785
He's slipping.

40:25.890 --> 40:26.914
Shit.

40:26.991 --> 40:28.583
Portman,
what the hell happened?

40:28.659 --> 40:30.456
I fell in the damn hole.

40:30.528 --> 40:31.517
Shit.

40:31.595 --> 40:34.063
Everybody, on me.
Watch your goddamn footing.

40:34.131 --> 40:35.120
Move.

40:35.599 --> 40:36.588
Shit.

40:51.215 --> 40:52.910
Goat, straight ahead.
Sir.

40:53.250 --> 40:54.274
Portman, you're with me.

40:54.351 --> 40:56.649
John, take the Kid
and go to the right.

41:08.532 --> 41:09.521
Shit!

41:32.590 --> 41:33.955
You lost your folks, right?

41:34.024 --> 41:35.013
Shut up.

41:35.826 --> 41:38.351
Small world. I mean,
I lost my parents, too.

41:40.130 --> 41:41.791
Yeah, I mean,
I woke up one morning...

41:41.866 --> 41:42.958
and everything was gone.

41:43.033 --> 41:44.591
I mean, the only thing left
was me.

41:44.668 --> 41:47.193
They wanted the TV
more than they wanted me.

41:48.572 --> 41:49.561
Ah!

41:50.608 --> 41:52.542
Every time
you open your mouth...

41:52.610 --> 41:54.237
you give away our position.

41:56.247 --> 41:57.509
Wait a minute.

42:02.586 --> 42:04.713
Your pupils are dilated.

42:05.222 --> 42:06.951
Are you high?
What?

42:08.259 --> 42:10.659
No, I got this condition...
I don't give a damn.

42:10.728 --> 42:12.320
You take one more shot
of that shit...

42:12.396 --> 42:14.421
and I'll blow holes in you.
Are we clear?

42:14.632 --> 42:15.621
Okay.

42:24.475 --> 42:25.464
Get down.

42:25.543 --> 42:26.737
I'm sorry, look,
I just needed a little...

42:26.810 --> 42:27.902
Get down!

42:30.314 --> 42:33.112
Goat, I think there's
something coming up on you.

42:37.888 --> 42:39.412
This isn't happening.

42:41.025 --> 42:42.390
My light is down.

42:51.702 --> 42:52.828
I don't see anything.

42:52.903 --> 42:55.303
<i>Don't move. I'm on my way.</i>

42:56.774 --> 42:57.763
Pinky.

42:58.809 --> 43:00.333
<i>Can you see anything?</i>

43:02.513 --> 43:05.073
<i>No. Nothing.</i>

43:19.263 --> 43:20.423
Dr. Willits?

43:27.638 --> 43:28.696
<i>Goat!</i>

43:29.139 --> 43:30.868
<i>Goat, what's your position?</i>

43:30.941 --> 43:32.568
<i>Goat, where are you?</i>

43:33.444 --> 43:34.809
<i>Goat, speak to me.</i>

43:34.878 --> 43:36.971
<i>God damn it, Reaper,</i>
<i>report to me.</i>

43:38.482 --> 43:39.642
You're dead.

43:40.551 --> 43:41.848
<i>Report contact.</i>

44:05.309 --> 44:06.799
Man down.

44:07.611 --> 44:09.238
Man down!

44:10.948 --> 44:11.437
Everyone, get to the Ark now!

44:12.683 --> 44:14.275
Hunegs, report to
the quarantine zone.

44:14.351 --> 44:17.377
Evacuate the entire facility.
Get everyone to the Ark now.

44:17.454 --> 44:19.388
What's going on?
Get to the goddamn Ark.

44:19.456 --> 44:20.616
Let's go. Come on.

44:20.691 --> 44:22.818
We have an emergency. Come on.

44:22.893 --> 44:24.827
Everybody to the Ark.

44:29.800 --> 44:30.994
What happened?

44:31.068 --> 44:32.467
He was talking about devils.

44:32.536 --> 44:33.560
Devils?

44:33.637 --> 44:36.333
All his Bible shit.
Angels. Good and evil.

44:36.407 --> 44:38.375
Devils among us.
Let's get this vest off him.

44:38.442 --> 44:39.807
Now he's clear.

44:41.912 --> 44:42.901
Come on.

44:43.981 --> 44:45.073
Got a weak pulse.

44:45.149 --> 44:46.776
Portman,
get me a line in here.

44:47.785 --> 44:48.877
Come on, man.

44:48.952 --> 44:51.045
Kid, keep pressure
on that wound.

44:51.488 --> 44:53.581
How's the pulse?
I'm losing him.

44:54.825 --> 44:56.952
Sam, give me
a shot of adrenaline.

45:02.299 --> 45:04.233
We lost the pulse.
Okay, let's defib.

45:05.836 --> 45:06.996
Come on, man.

45:10.307 --> 45:11.296
Clear!

45:15.512 --> 45:17.241
Where the hell's Carmack?

45:17.681 --> 45:18.978
He disappeared.

45:19.049 --> 45:20.380
What do you mean,
he disappeared?

45:20.451 --> 45:22.180
He's gone. He disappeared.

45:22.686 --> 45:24.381
I've lost the pulse.
Shit.

45:24.455 --> 45:25.479
Okay.

45:25.556 --> 45:27.353
Gonna defib. Clear!

45:29.827 --> 45:31.624
Come on.
Come on.

45:32.529 --> 45:33.928
No response.
We're losing him.

45:33.997 --> 45:35.897
Sam, give me that adrenaline.

45:45.542 --> 45:46.941
Come on,
you son of a bitch.

45:47.010 --> 45:48.705
Okay, going again.
Clear!

46:11.668 --> 46:12.760
He's gone.

46:22.412 --> 46:24.141
Doctor,
you are going to tell me...

46:24.214 --> 46:26.045
just what the fuck
is going on up here.

46:26.116 --> 46:27.481
What?
Come here.

46:29.653 --> 46:30.745
Come here!

46:32.523 --> 46:33.820
This is "what."

46:36.193 --> 46:37.182
God.

46:37.828 --> 46:39.489
Have you
found anything like this...

46:39.563 --> 46:40.928
on your archeological digs?

46:40.998 --> 46:41.987
No.

46:42.065 --> 46:43.862
Is there any way this thing
came from the outside...

46:43.934 --> 46:44.923
from the surface?

46:45.002 --> 46:46.833
The planet is completely dead.

46:46.904 --> 46:48.804
It came from somewhere, lady.

46:49.006 --> 46:50.337
Portman, shut up!

46:50.407 --> 46:53.137
The atmosphere on the surface
can't support life.

46:53.210 --> 46:54.268
Maybe it doesn't need air.

46:54.344 --> 46:56.039
It could have come from
another planet or something.

46:56.113 --> 46:57.205
What? Like an alien?

46:57.281 --> 46:58.942
Look at that thing!
Portman!

46:59.016 --> 47:00.984
You need to shut the fuck up!

47:01.151 --> 47:02.743
That's not what we saw.

47:03.720 --> 47:06.484
That isn't what Goat and I
shot at in Genetics.

47:06.557 --> 47:09.253
You telling me there's more
of these fucking things?

47:09.326 --> 47:10.953
Where are
your surface entry points?

47:11.028 --> 47:13.929
There's a pressure door at
the end of the north corridor.

47:13.997 --> 47:15.692
Destroyer, Kid, Portman,
get there on the double.

47:15.766 --> 47:16.824
Give me an update.

47:16.900 --> 47:18.765
Yes, sir.
Whatever this thing is...

47:18.836 --> 47:20.929
it cannot get back
through the Ark.

47:21.004 --> 47:23.495
Mac, I want you to arm Pinky
with a weapon...

47:23.574 --> 47:26.702
with some ST grenades,
and seal the Ark door.

47:26.777 --> 47:27.937
There's one other door.

47:28.011 --> 47:29.069
Where?

47:29.146 --> 47:32.081
The entrance
to the archeological dig.

47:32.716 --> 47:34.775
<i>Ark portal activation</i>
<i>in progress.</i>

47:34.885 --> 47:37.046
Don't let anything
through the Ark.

47:39.990 --> 47:42.925
Hey, wait. Wait a minute.
You can't leave me here.

47:42.993 --> 47:44.460
I'm not a soldier.

47:44.528 --> 47:45.961
Why don't you go
fuck yourself?

47:46.029 --> 47:47.053
It's bullshit.

47:47.130 --> 47:48.358
You're supposed to protect me.

47:48.432 --> 47:49.865
Ark secure.

47:49.933 --> 47:52.697
<i>Remaining personnel,</i>
<i>ready for evacuation.</i>

48:01.645 --> 48:03.044
Shit.

48:03.714 --> 48:04.874
Duke.

48:05.716 --> 48:06.944
Hold this open.

48:10.821 --> 48:12.152
Don't be a wuss.

48:31.108 --> 48:33.042
Little tension
between you and Reaper?

48:33.176 --> 48:35.610
We just went
our separate ways.

48:35.913 --> 48:39.474
Why does a talented student
throw it all away
and join the RRTS?

48:40.484 --> 48:41.678
So, what was
he like before?

48:41.785 --> 48:43.480
Who, John?
Yeah.

48:43.553 --> 48:45.077
Empathetic, sensitive.

48:45.155 --> 48:47.385
It's kind of hard for me to
imagine Reaper as sensitive.

48:47.624 --> 48:51.617
I knew Reaper before all the
"drop down and give me 50,
woo-ha" stuff.

48:52.696 --> 48:53.890
Yeah?

48:54.932 --> 48:56.866
Well, it's hua...
Hua.

48:56.934 --> 48:58.299
Yeah.

48:59.603 --> 49:01.298
Do you have a family?

49:01.872 --> 49:04.500
I have Destroyer.
You know, we grew up together.

49:05.742 --> 49:08.575
You know, Duke, I bet
secretly you have a big heart.

49:08.679 --> 49:09.907
Oh, yeah?

49:12.049 --> 49:14.483
And that's not the only
secret big thing I got.

49:15.652 --> 49:16.710
Little rusty, huh?

49:16.787 --> 49:19.517
Oh, lady,
you have no idea.

49:20.057 --> 49:23.458
Right now, having sex
with me is practically
your civic duty.

49:27.564 --> 49:29.589
I need a power bone saw.

49:29.700 --> 49:31.691
A power bone saw?

49:32.102 --> 49:34.502
Girl, I've been waiting
on you my whole life.

49:36.073 --> 49:37.904
There's one
in the procedure room.

49:38.108 --> 49:41.100
Down the corridor,
on the left,
through the nanowall.

49:41.645 --> 49:43.010
Through the nanowall?

49:45.282 --> 49:47.944
All right,
I got it. It's cool.

49:48.051 --> 49:50.349
For you I got it,
'cause you're pretty.

49:50.420 --> 49:51.444
Cool.

49:51.521 --> 49:52.818
I wouldn't do it for a dude,
you know.

49:52.889 --> 49:54.117
Off you go.

49:56.727 --> 49:58.854
We're going back in
through the airlock.

49:59.396 --> 50:01.227
We're not calling in backup?

50:02.966 --> 50:04.365
The Ark is sealed.

50:04.901 --> 50:05.959
Nothing gets back...

50:06.036 --> 50:08.061
until everything
on this planet is dead.

50:08.638 --> 50:10.105
We're going in hot.

50:10.807 --> 50:12.104
You're serious.

50:12.642 --> 50:14.132
Pick up your weapon, Portman.

50:14.211 --> 50:15.906
Come on, Portman, move out.

50:15.979 --> 50:18.243
Didn't y'all see
how that thing greased Goat?

50:19.049 --> 50:21.540
We don't know what
we're dealing with here.

50:22.686 --> 50:24.017
It's SOP to call in
reinforcements...

50:24.087 --> 50:25.054
when a situation...

50:25.122 --> 50:26.111
We are...

50:27.057 --> 50:28.524
the reinforcements.

50:35.766 --> 50:37.233
Now, you shoulder...

50:37.501 --> 50:39.435
your fucking weapon, soldier.

50:53.517 --> 50:56.145
<i>All UAC personnel</i>
<i>evacuated to Earth.</i>

51:17.774 --> 51:18.763
Duke?

51:43.266 --> 51:44.255
Duke?

51:46.803 --> 51:47.792
Duke!

51:50.307 --> 51:52.969
Hey, hey, hey.
It's just a power shortage.

51:53.276 --> 51:54.265
You okay?

51:55.946 --> 51:57.470
Here's your bone saw.

51:58.515 --> 51:59.846
So, which of you
is the oldest?

51:59.916 --> 52:00.974
What?

52:01.685 --> 52:03.710
Oh, me. By two minutes.

52:03.820 --> 52:05.117
Twins? Shit.

52:05.589 --> 52:06.954
Identical, right?

52:14.531 --> 52:16.328
Sam, get back in the lab.

52:39.322 --> 52:40.311
Shit.

52:44.794 --> 52:46.318
Motherfucker!

52:47.230 --> 52:48.288
Close it!

52:58.008 --> 53:00.203
And that's why
I don't do nanowalls.

53:01.711 --> 53:04.339
<i>Pinky, we're entering</i>
<i>the archeological dig.</i>

53:14.724 --> 53:15.952
Secure the exit.

54:10.280 --> 54:12.111
<i> Sam.</i>
<i>I'm coming.</i>

54:13.883 --> 54:16.010
<i>I'm hungry. Let's eat.</i>

54:24.794 --> 54:27.194
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

54:27.297 --> 54:30.027
<i>Careful now.</i>
<i>Not too close, John.</i>

54:32.035 --> 54:33.434
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

54:34.437 --> 54:35.734
<i>Slow down.</i>

54:36.306 --> 54:38.103
<i>Go around. Go around again.</i>

54:38.174 --> 54:40.369
<i>No! Mommy!</i>

54:48.518 --> 54:50.247
Is this where it happened?

54:52.922 --> 54:54.514
Did you find the door?

55:06.770 --> 55:07.759
<i>John?</i>

55:12.976 --> 55:13.965

55:19.316 --> 55:20.305
Thurman.

55:22.552 --> 55:23.780
Look at them.

55:24.421 --> 55:27.447
They weren't trying to stop
something from getting in.

55:28.391 --> 55:30.757
Something stopped them
from getting out.

55:32.429 --> 55:33.521
<i>Mac, stand by.</i>

55:33.763 --> 55:34.752
<i>Destroyer, report.</i>

55:34.831 --> 55:36.355
<i>We've reached</i>
<i>the north airlock.</i>

<i>It's secure.</i>

<i>Console indicates nothing's</i>
<i>come in or out for 26 hours.</i>

55:44.741 --> 55:45.730

55:47.077 --> 55:48.066
Mac.

55:49.179 --> 55:51.909
Mac, Mac, you copy?

55:54.751 --> 55:56.582
Talk to me. Talk to me, Mac.

55:59.055 --> 56:00.044
Shit.

56:02.325 --> 56:03.815
Jesus Christ.

56:10.900 --> 56:13.460
We're in pursuit.
Moving fast out of the dig.

56:13.570 --> 56:14.969
It's getting away.

56:15.138 --> 56:16.537
Pinky, what do you see?

56:16.606 --> 56:18.665
It's big. Very big.

56:19.042 --> 56:21.340
Moving fast,
back towards the lab complex.

56:24.514 --> 56:25.503
Clear.

56:27.417 --> 56:28.941
It's back in the lab.

56:33.323 --> 56:34.312
Clear!

56:35.458 --> 56:36.447
Clear.

56:37.327 --> 56:38.692
Damn, it's fast.

56:39.629 --> 56:40.960
All around defense, men.

56:41.030 --> 56:42.327
Did you get it?

56:44.000 --> 56:45.058
Pinky.
<i>Yes, Sarge?</i>

56:45.135 --> 56:46.329
Anything gets through
that door...

56:46.403 --> 56:47.370
use an ST grenade.

56:47.437 --> 56:49.268
<i>It cannot get back to Earth.</i>

56:50.940 --> 56:53.238
He pops an ST in there,
he's gonna blow the Ark.

56:53.309 --> 56:55.504
Reaper, Kid, pairs,
cover formation.

56:55.578 --> 56:57.273
Sweep the corridors. Go.

56:58.148 --> 57:00.878
Destroyer, you and Portman
stay here. Shut the airlock.

57:00.950 --> 57:02.110
Maintain a perimeter.

57:02.185 --> 57:03.345
He blows the Ark,
how the hell...

57:03.420 --> 57:04.853
are we supposed to
get the fuck home?

57:04.921 --> 57:07.014
Portman,
shut the fucking door.

57:07.290 --> 57:08.655
Where you going?

57:09.025 --> 57:10.515
I'm going to the armory.

57:11.227 --> 57:12.785
I think we're gonna
need something...

57:12.862 --> 57:14.420
with a little bit more kick.

57:44.260 --> 57:45.249
Jesus.

57:46.229 --> 57:48.254
You see
anything like it before?

58:02.445 --> 58:03.434
Heart.

58:11.421 --> 58:12.445
Liver.

58:23.566 --> 58:24.828
Kidneys.

58:25.001 --> 58:26.696
Dogs got kidneys, right?

58:27.003 --> 58:28.368
Pigs got kidneys.

58:37.280 --> 58:39.180
It's had its appendix removed.

58:39.916 --> 58:41.042
It's human.

58:41.918 --> 58:43.283
What the fuck?

59:26.529 --> 59:28.258
Goat knew he was turning.

59:36.005 --> 59:38.132
This thing
didn't butcher Willits.

59:41.511 --> 59:42.910
It is Willits.

59:43.580 --> 59:44.569
What?

59:51.454 --> 59:53.046
This is bullshit, man.

59:53.790 --> 59:55.155
I enlisted
to serve my country...

59:55.224 --> 59:57.215
not get greased protecting
some corporation's...

59:57.293 --> 59:58.692
goddamn science project.

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:03.488
I gotta take a dump.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.427
What? Now?

01:00:06.202 --> 01:00:09.069
Unless you want me shitting
my pants right here.

01:00:15.011 --> 01:00:17.070
<i>Please provide DNA</i>
<i>verification.</i>

01:00:20.583 --> 01:00:23.381
<i>Welcome, Patricia Tallman.</i>
<i>Access granted.</i>

01:00:36.366 --> 01:00:39.130
Big fucking gun.

01:01:05.561 --> 01:01:06.823
Oh, shit.

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:09.352
Portman, I got floor and wall
on your gun cam.

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:12.284
<i>I'm taking a shit,</i>
<i>you fucking gimp.</i>

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:16.525
<i>Fuck you, Portman,</i>
<i>you piece of shit.</i>

01:02:45.194 --> 01:02:46.456
Lost Portman on comm...

01:02:46.529 --> 01:02:48.497
and all I've got on Destroyer
is a wall.

01:02:48.564 --> 01:02:50.031
Portman, come in.

01:02:51.567 --> 01:02:52.659
Destroyer.

01:02:53.236 --> 01:02:54.225
Come in.

01:03:17.393 --> 01:03:18.883
This is Corporal
Dean Portman...

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:22.590
with RRTS 6 Special Ops
on Olduvai, 0310 hours.

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.828
We have encountered
hostile activity.

01:04:55.191 --> 01:04:59.423
I repeat, require immediate
RRTS reinforcements.

01:05:28.157 --> 01:05:31.456
Destroyer, Portman,
where the hell are you?

01:05:41.137 --> 01:05:42.434
Shit.

01:07:21.837 --> 01:07:22.826
Shit.

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:36.911
<i>Oh, God! Jesus!</i>

01:07:37.253 --> 01:07:38.242
Hmm.

01:07:43.159 --> 01:07:45.059
Pinky, you got Portman?
<i>No.</i>

01:08:04.046 --> 01:08:05.513
Holy shit.

01:08:21.096 --> 01:08:22.189
He's gone.

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:29.029
Destroyer?

01:08:29.305 --> 01:08:30.465
And Portman.

01:08:30.538 --> 01:08:31.870
What the fuck happened, man?

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:33.465
I got him, I got him.

01:08:36.812 --> 01:08:38.336
Destroyer, I got you, man.

01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:40.678
What's up, man?

01:08:49.692 --> 01:08:51.158
What the hell is this?

01:08:51.227 --> 01:08:53.694
And whose goddamn blood
is on that window?

01:08:53.761 --> 01:08:54.751
Goat's.

01:08:56.432 --> 01:08:57.591
He killed himself.

01:08:57.666 --> 01:09:00.794
What do you mean,
he killed himself?
He was already dead.

01:09:01.569 --> 01:09:03.629
It's true.
It's Goat.

01:09:04.073 --> 01:09:07.531
He was changing into
one of these motherfuckers
and he killed himself.

01:09:07.609 --> 01:09:09.975
We found two more scientists
at the dig.

01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:11.941
Thurman and a balding guy
with glasses.

01:09:12.014 --> 01:09:13.345
Dr. Clay.

01:09:15.984 --> 01:09:17.577
Did you check their necks?

01:09:17.653 --> 01:09:19.381
Were there open wounds
on their necks?

01:09:19.455 --> 01:09:21.821
We were conducting
a firefight, not an autopsy.

01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:24.689
We came up here to find
six scientists.

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:26.158
Four are known dead...

01:09:26.295 --> 01:09:29.662
and Dr. Willits is
probably KIA somewhere
down in that sewer.

01:09:29.865 --> 01:09:31.924
The only one missing
is Dr. Carmack.

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:34.094
Has Dr. Carmack showed up yet?

01:09:34.937 --> 01:09:36.631
Oh, he's shown up all right.

01:09:37.606 --> 01:09:39.130
Look at the left ear.

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:48.948
Son of a bitch.

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:51.042
I think this other one
is Steve Willits.

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.917
I'm going to run the DNA,
check it against his
med records.

01:09:53.988 --> 01:09:55.650
What are you people
working on up here?

01:09:55.724 --> 01:09:58.318
We're analyzing bones,
artifacts.

01:09:58.394 --> 01:10:00.123
We're not doing
anything like this.

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:01.925
Then what the fuck is that?

01:10:01.997 --> 01:10:06.263
It must be a genetic mutation,
something environmental
or viral.

01:10:06.535 --> 01:10:07.763
I don't know.

01:10:08.604 --> 01:10:10.333
It may even be reversible.

01:10:10.639 --> 01:10:11.731
It's irreversible.

01:10:11.807 --> 01:10:13.172
Not necessarily.

01:10:13.242 --> 01:10:14.937
Dr. Carmack's condition...

01:10:16.111 --> 01:10:17.510
is irreversible...

01:10:20.349 --> 01:10:21.509
No!

01:10:22.851 --> 01:10:25.115
Because Carmack's condition
is that...

01:10:26.288 --> 01:10:27.380
he's dead.

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:30.458
Kid, you and Duke...

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:34.088
get back to the dig
and you make sure
those other dead scientists...

01:10:34.163 --> 01:10:35.528
are really dead.

01:10:42.204 --> 01:10:43.432
I've lost...

01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:45.697
four soldiers.

01:10:46.342 --> 01:10:50.745
What are you people
experimenting with up here?

01:10:53.649 --> 01:10:55.640
I'm not gonna ask you again.

01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:59.950
I told you,
it's an archeological
research center.

01:11:01.423 --> 01:11:03.983
Do you think I'm lying to you?
Is that what you're saying?

01:11:07.997 --> 01:11:09.658
You think
I'm hiding something?

01:11:12.301 --> 01:11:13.893
I'm telling the truth.

01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:21.002
What were you downloading?

01:11:21.076 --> 01:11:23.010
What were you sent to protect?

01:11:25.047 --> 01:11:26.537
The research data.

01:11:28.217 --> 01:11:30.378
Research into what?

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:39.720
<i>Subject was injected</i>
<i>with study agent at 00:03.</i>

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:46.699
<i>Vitals normal, elevated</i>
<i>heart rate attributable</i>
<i>to subject anxiety.</i>

01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:52.637
<i>C- 24 successfully grafted to</i>
<i>subject's marker cells</i>
<i>at 00:09.</i>

01:11:52.708 --> 01:11:55.905
He reconstructed chromosome
mutation on a human subject.

01:11:57.079 --> 01:11:59.274
We were never gonna do
human studies.

01:12:00.082 --> 01:12:01.709
What the hell
are we looking at?

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:06.980
Genesis, Chapter 1.

01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:12.083
<i>Subject moved to protected</i>
<i>observation area at 00:17.</i>

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:21.028
<i>Subject: Curtis Stahl.</i>

01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:24.600
<i>Crime: Multiple murder.</i>

01:12:25.974 --> 01:12:28.875
<i>Status:</i>
<i>Condemned to execution.</i>

01:12:39.221 --> 01:12:40.813
Chromosome 24.

01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:43.847
Oh, my God.

01:12:44.059 --> 01:12:47.825
<i>49 minutes after injection,</i>
<i>genetic mutations...</i>

01:12:47.896 --> 01:12:51.627
<i>began to visually manifest on</i>
<i>subject's extremities.</i>

01:13:02.144 --> 01:13:04.339
This is what you're
here to protect.

01:13:04.847 --> 01:13:06.280
It doesn't make any sense.

01:13:06.348 --> 01:13:08.509
You trusted them.
They lied to you.

01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:11.118
They used you, Sam.

01:13:11.653 --> 01:13:13.712
If he perfected xenogenesis...

01:13:13.789 --> 01:13:15.950
Christ, don't you get it?

01:13:16.024 --> 01:13:18.618
It's this place. It's hell.
It always was.

01:13:22.364 --> 01:13:23.991
This shit ends here.

01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:27.166
What are you doing?

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:28.999
We need to destroy
these discs.

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:30.595
That's UAC property.

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:33.608
Fuck UAC, we take this back,
they'll just...

01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:35.934
We take the data back.

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:40.438
Sarge, do you not see
what's going on here?
I didn't see shit.

01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:43.550
And I ain't paid to see shit.

01:13:43.852 --> 01:13:45.479
I have my orders.
And so do you.

01:13:48.190 --> 01:13:49.657
Is this everything?

01:13:50.959 --> 01:13:53.519
I said, is this everything?

01:13:53.929 --> 01:13:57.160
I, uh, have three
more to download.
Then do it.

01:14:10.879 --> 01:14:11.868
Sarge?

01:14:12.881 --> 01:14:13.905
We got a problem.

01:14:13.982 --> 01:14:16.041
<i>One dead scientist is missing.</i>

01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:17.908
Now.

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:22.390
You just wanna leave her here?

01:14:22.758 --> 01:14:24.350
She's got a job to do.

01:14:27.396 --> 01:14:31.662
Look, this is Portman's comm.
You call if you need help,
okay?

01:14:34.636 --> 01:14:35.967
You gonna be all right?

01:14:38.106 --> 01:14:39.334
I'll be fine.

01:14:39.575 --> 01:14:41.440
Okay. I'll see you soon.

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:47.907
<i>Pinky, are you there? Pinky.</i>

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:51.612
Sarge? Something is cutting
through the Ark door.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.119
You have a visual?

01:14:53.822 --> 01:14:55.551
<i>Oh, I got a visual all right.</i>

01:14:55.757 --> 01:14:57.588
Don't let it get to the Ark!

01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.184
<i>Five.</i>

01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:00.853
Pinky, use the grenade!
<i>Four.</i>

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:02.725
Use the goddamn grenade!
<i>Three, two.</i>

01:15:03.098 --> 01:15:04.565
Throw it!
<i>One.</i>

01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:24.145
Pinky's gone. That fucker ran.

01:15:24.219 --> 01:15:25.208
Shit.

01:15:25.454 --> 01:15:26.751
It got through.

01:15:27.289 --> 01:15:28.551
What the hell is that?

01:15:28.624 --> 01:15:29.989
<i>System reboot.</i>

01:15:30.058 --> 01:15:33.755
<i>Time required to begin</i>
<i>renewed operation:</i>
<i>Five minutes.</i>

01:15:33.829 --> 01:15:35.387
Quarantine cordon is breached.

01:15:35.464 --> 01:15:37.432
This mission is
no longer containment.

01:15:37.499 --> 01:15:39.865
Get all the weapons and ammo
you can. We're going through.

01:15:39.935 --> 01:15:40.924
Move!

01:15:41.103 --> 01:15:42.570
Sam, come in. Over.

01:15:42.638 --> 01:15:44.799
Sam, do you read me? Over.
Come in!

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:47.698
She's not answering.

01:15:48.076 --> 01:15:49.907
<i>Time required to begin</i>
<i>renewed operation...</i>

01:15:49.978 --> 01:15:52.378
<i>four minutes and 45 seconds.</i>

01:15:52.681 --> 01:15:53.943
You got three.

01:16:00.422 --> 01:16:02.652
Sam! Come in, Sam!

01:16:14.937 --> 01:16:15.961
Sam!

01:16:16.171 --> 01:16:18.230
Sam, why didn't you answer
your comm? We gotta go now!

01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:20.138
Why did they take Goat
and not Destroyer?

01:16:20.208 --> 01:16:22.176
Why Carmack
and not Dr. Thurman?

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:24.235
What?
Lucy had
the 24th chromosome...

01:16:24.313 --> 01:16:25.302
but she wasn't a monster.

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:28.508
She died protecting her child,
not devouring it.

01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:31.250
Why did the same chromosome
that made her superhuman...

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.185
turn Stahl into a monster?

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:35.189
Let's go.
Just give me a minute.

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:38.124
We don't have a minute.
Then give me 10 seconds.

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:42.329
This is its tongue.

01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:45.099
This is brain matter
from Portman.

01:16:50.472 --> 01:16:52.099
This is from Destroyer.

01:16:59.848 --> 01:17:01.475
It's choosing, John.

01:17:02.217 --> 01:17:04.242
It's choosing who to infect.

01:17:04.987 --> 01:17:06.818
It's choosing?
How is it choosing?

01:17:06.888 --> 01:17:10.380
There are genetic markers
for psychotic
and violent behavior.

01:17:11.193 --> 01:17:13.388
It could be a specific
neurotransmitter...

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:15.589
it's picking up on,
a ganglion.

01:17:15.897 --> 01:17:18.195
Latching onto numbers
in the DNA code linked to...

01:17:18.266 --> 01:17:20.996
Linked to what? Evil?

01:17:21.169 --> 01:17:23.729
Ten percent of the human
genome is still unmapped.

01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:26.638
Some say it's the genetic
blueprint for the soul.

01:17:27.175 --> 01:17:30.235
Maybe C-24 is what destroyed
the population.

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:33.343
It would explain
why some of them
had to build the Ark...

01:17:33.415 --> 01:17:35.315
to escape to a new beginning.

01:17:35.917 --> 01:17:39.751
Some it made superhuman.
Others, monsters.

01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:43.250
Oh, my God.

01:17:43.892 --> 01:17:45.519
We gotta get out of here now.
What?

01:17:45.594 --> 01:17:47.619
Come on, let's go, come on.

01:17:47.896 --> 01:17:49.921
The people quarantined on
the other side of the Ark...

01:17:49.998 --> 01:17:51.329
they won't all be infected!

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:52.765
What's going on?

01:17:53.835 --> 01:17:56.861
Sarge is going to
kill them all. Come on.

01:17:59.074 --> 01:18:02.703
We uphold quarantine.
Nothing gets to the elevator
back on Earth.

01:18:02.778 --> 01:18:04.803
We can't let them
get to the surface.

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:06.973
If it breathes, kill it.
<i>Five...</i>

01:18:07.082 --> 01:18:09.516
<i>four, three...</i>

01:18:09.951 --> 01:18:12.419
<i>two, one.</i>

01:18:19.895 --> 01:18:21.522
<i>Ark travel complete.</i>

01:18:23.765 --> 01:18:25.733
<i>This is</i>
<i>Corporal Dean Portman...</i>

01:18:25.801 --> 01:18:28.929
<i>with RRTS 6 Special Ops</i>
<i>on Olduvai, 0310 hours.</i>

01:18:30.038 --> 01:18:32.233
<i>We have encountered</i>
<i>hostile activity.</i>

01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:36.106
<i>Require immediate</i>
<i>RRTS reinforcements.</i>

01:18:36.445 --> 01:18:38.003
Yeah, no shit.

01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:41.743
We got 58 minutes before
the auto lockdown is lifted.

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:44.241
Reset it
for another six hours.

01:18:44.319 --> 01:18:46.150
I can't. It's been disabled.

01:18:46.488 --> 01:18:48.388
Same as the topside comm link.

01:18:48.457 --> 01:18:50.015
They're disabling
computers now?

01:18:50.092 --> 01:18:52.287
Yeah,
they're rocket scientists,
remember?

01:20:02.764 --> 01:20:04.857
<i>Ark travel complete.</i>

01:20:05.367 --> 01:20:06.459
Oh, my God.

01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:10.562
Sarge,
what's your position?

01:20:22.384 --> 01:20:23.373
Sarge.

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:25.749
Sarge, come in.
Do you copy?

01:20:26.021 --> 01:20:28.251
Come in, Sarge.
Do you read me? Over.

01:20:28.323 --> 01:20:29.915
<i>Sarge, come in,</i>
<i>do you copy?</i>

01:20:30.225 --> 01:20:31.715
Loud and clear.

01:20:31.793 --> 01:20:33.226
<i>Look, do not kill everybody.</i>

01:20:33.295 --> 01:20:35.126
<i>I repeat,</i>
<i>do not kill everybody.</i>

01:20:35.197 --> 01:20:36.528
Help me.
<i>They're not all infected.</i>

01:20:36.598 --> 01:20:38.896
Help me, help me, please.
<i>Do you copy?</i>

01:20:39.267 --> 01:20:41.531
Copy that.
Help me.

01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:52.068
Clear the rest of this sector
and meet back
at the Ark chamber.

01:21:13.268 --> 01:21:14.792
Jesus Christ,
what the hell are...

01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:16.303
Who the hell's in there?

01:21:17.839 --> 01:21:21.297
Well, don't just stand there,
you dumb son of a bitch.
Help me up.

01:21:27.282 --> 01:21:28.271
It's okay.

01:21:38.793 --> 01:21:39.782
Please...

01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:42.457
help us.

01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:47.828
You don't have to
kill all of them.

01:21:48.069 --> 01:21:52.733
I don't think everyone
is infected, or even capable
of being infected.

01:21:54.376 --> 01:21:57.675
We have orders
to contain this threat
by any means necessary.

01:21:57.746 --> 01:22:00.180
So let's evacuate
the uninfected...

01:22:00.815 --> 01:22:02.214
and blow this place to hell.

01:22:02.284 --> 01:22:04.218
And we have orders
to protect this facility.

01:22:04.286 --> 01:22:06.481
We don't have orders
to kill innocent people.

01:22:09.791 --> 01:22:12.760
We have to stop anything
from getting to the surface...

01:22:13.228 --> 01:22:15.628
by any means...

01:22:16.197 --> 01:22:17.255
necessary.

01:22:18.733 --> 01:22:21.327
Found this little chicken shit
hiding under a pile
of dead bodies.

01:22:21.403 --> 01:22:22.961
Am I glad to see you guys.

01:22:23.038 --> 01:22:25.199
That thing
cut right through the door.

01:22:25.273 --> 01:22:28.333
I tried to use the grenade
but it came at me too fast.

01:22:29.077 --> 01:22:32.308
Followed me through the Ark
and started to kill everybody.

01:22:32.981 --> 01:22:34.005
It was horrible.

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:37.483
There's no wound on his neck.
He's clean.

01:22:40.288 --> 01:22:42.813
I say who's clean...

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:46.493
and who's not.

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:48.990
I mean, it wasn't my fault.

01:22:50.565 --> 01:22:52.795
Hey, I'm not a soldier.
You shouldn't have left me...

01:22:52.867 --> 01:22:53.856
Sarge.

01:22:56.705 --> 01:22:58.764
There's a storeroom
to the south.

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:01.274
It's got, like, 20 people
holed up inside of it.

01:23:01.343 --> 01:23:02.935
We gotta do something.

01:23:04.112 --> 01:23:06.376
Your orders were
to clear that sector.

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:09.078
Is it cleared?

01:23:09.684 --> 01:23:11.515
No, I told them to stay put.

01:23:12.487 --> 01:23:14.421
They're okay.
They're just scared shitless.

01:23:14.889 --> 01:23:16.049
We kill them all.

01:23:20.428 --> 01:23:22.020
Let God sort them out.

01:23:23.631 --> 01:23:24.893
This is wrong.

01:23:25.266 --> 01:23:27.427
I think...
Son, you don't think.

01:23:29.938 --> 01:23:31.303
That's an order.

01:23:33.208 --> 01:23:35.039
We're in the field, soldier.

01:23:35.176 --> 01:23:36.871
Sarge,
if nothing's found them...

01:23:36.945 --> 01:23:40.711
You will obey
the direct order...

01:23:42.617 --> 01:23:44.414
of your commanding officer.

01:23:52.494 --> 01:23:53.620
No.

01:23:56.564 --> 01:23:57.724
Now.

01:23:59.834 --> 01:24:00.960
Go to hell.

01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:02.833
No!

01:24:03.605 --> 01:24:05.163
No.
Holy shit.

01:24:15.583 --> 01:24:19.212
Mutinous insurrection
is punishable...

01:24:20.755 --> 01:24:21.744
by death.

01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:29.458
It was his first mission!
And it's not gonna be
my last.

01:24:29.831 --> 01:24:31.264
I need soldiers.

01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:34.592
I don't need anybody else
but soldiers.

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:11.337
Drop the weapons.

01:25:11.739 --> 01:25:12.831
I mean it.

01:25:13.241 --> 01:25:16.904
I have no intention
of being killed by a madman.
Drop the weapons.

01:25:22.484 --> 01:25:23.849
Ah, there's something
behind me, isn't there?

01:25:37.765 --> 01:25:38.754
On me.

01:25:43.004 --> 01:25:43.993
Get Sam.

01:26:01.656 --> 01:26:02.748
Wait here.

01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:17.059
Listen.

01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:28.481
Withdraw!
Withdraw behind the nanowall.

01:26:29.017 --> 01:26:31.952
Move!
I can't see. I can't see.

01:26:44.666 --> 01:26:45.655
Move.

01:26:52.073 --> 01:26:53.370
Clear!

01:26:57.612 --> 01:26:59.705
Fuck! The wall's not closing!

01:27:25.773 --> 01:27:27.741
I'm not supposed to die.

01:27:30.178 --> 01:27:31.167
Let's go.

01:27:34.882 --> 01:27:36.782
Come on.

01:27:38.886 --> 01:27:39.875
Clear.

01:27:43.291 --> 01:27:45.384
How long
before they get through?

01:27:46.995 --> 01:27:47.984
Not long.

01:27:49.697 --> 01:27:51.221
You've been hit.

01:27:51.733 --> 01:27:52.995
Oh, John.

01:28:08.449 --> 01:28:10.041
Listen to me, Sam.

01:28:11.419 --> 01:28:14.252
You're cold. Shivering.

01:28:16.057 --> 01:28:17.354
It's important.

01:28:17.992 --> 01:28:19.892
This is an ST grenade.

01:28:21.696 --> 01:28:23.425
When they come through...

01:28:24.999 --> 01:28:27.160
you pop the top
and hit the button.

01:28:31.039 --> 01:28:33.473
John, stay with me.
Stay awake.

01:28:34.275 --> 01:28:36.800
John, stay with me, please.

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:44.311
What's that?

01:28:45.086 --> 01:28:48.419
It's C-24.
It's from Carmack's lab.
No.

01:28:48.623 --> 01:28:51.387
It could save you.
No way, forget it.

01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:53.722
You're bleeding to death.

01:28:54.696 --> 01:28:56.994
No way, Sam.

01:28:59.734 --> 01:29:01.463
I've done some bad things.

01:29:05.907 --> 01:29:07.238
I know you.

01:29:08.443 --> 01:29:09.808
You don't know me.

01:29:11.946 --> 01:29:13.243
You don't know.

01:29:14.048 --> 01:29:17.211
You're my brother.
I know you.

01:29:21.522 --> 01:29:22.511
Wait.

01:29:24.459 --> 01:29:25.448
Wait.

01:29:26.728 --> 01:29:29.697
If I should turn into
one of those demons.

01:29:32.567 --> 01:29:34.728
One through the heart,
one through the head...

01:29:34.802 --> 01:29:36.463
don't you hesitate. Okay?

01:29:36.637 --> 01:29:38.002
I won't need to.

01:29:57.392 --> 01:29:58.950
<i>I know you.</i>

01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:01.594
<i>You're my brother.</i>

01:30:09.704 --> 01:30:10.796
Sam?

01:31:59.447 --> 01:32:00.573
<i>Sam.</i>

01:32:27.408 --> 01:32:28.397
<i>Sam.</i>

01:33:31.739 --> 01:33:32.763
Sam.

01:33:44.452 --> 01:33:45.441
<i>John.</i>

01:34:53.688 --> 01:34:54.677
Sam.

01:34:59.393 --> 01:35:00.382
Sam.

01:35:31.959 --> 01:35:35.156
Sam.
You're alive.

01:35:35.796 --> 01:35:36.922
Shh. Don't talk.

01:35:37.631 --> 01:35:40.361
Last man standing, Reaper.

01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:48.171
I think she needs
medical attention.

01:35:53.848 --> 01:35:56.749
Can you get to the elevator?
I'm not sure.

01:35:58.719 --> 01:35:59.811
Try.

01:36:05.493 --> 01:36:07.688
Where are the survivors
Kid found?

01:36:09.196 --> 01:36:11.027
I took care of that problem.

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:16.668
Quarantine's almost over.
Power should be back on
any minute.

01:36:21.442 --> 01:36:26.038
You killed the Kid.
We're all killers, Reaper.

01:36:28.382 --> 01:36:29.872
It's what they pay us for.

01:36:30.885 --> 01:36:34.321
<i>Quarantine complete.</i>
<i>Elevators back on line.</i>

01:36:46.033 --> 01:36:47.295
It's finished.

01:36:49.136 --> 01:36:52.333
What do you say we go outside
and get some fresh air?

01:37:00.514 --> 01:37:04.575
Are you gonna shoot me?
Yeah, I was thinking about it.

01:37:05.352 --> 01:37:08.412
What you got left?
Half a clip. You?

01:37:19.333 --> 01:37:21.301
I've got one round.

01:39:58.792 --> 01:40:01.056
<i>Semper fi,</i> motherfucker.

01:40:03.497 --> 01:40:05.965
Faithful to the Corps, John.

01:42:54.168 --> 01:42:55.362
Ugh.

01:42:56.670 --> 01:42:59.104
<i>Ark portal activation</i>
<i>in progress.</i>

01:43:11.885 --> 01:43:12.874
<i>Five...</i>

<i>four, three...</i>

01:43:15.989 --> 01:43:18.219
<i>two, one.</i>

01:43:32.039 --> 01:43:33.529
Like the Kid said:

01:43:35.809 --> 01:43:36.935
"Go to hell."

01:44:11.411 --> 01:44:12.776
Almost home.
