00:00.320 --> 00:02.588
<i>One of the keys to the reverse cat eye</i>

00:02.613 --> 00:05.108
<i>is you wanna draw the line
as close as you can</i>

00:05.133 --> 00:08.045
<i>to the bottom lashes and extend it out.</i>

00:08.070 --> 00:11.472
<i>However, a trick being
that you can use your pencil</i>

00:11.497 --> 00:13.218
<i>and you can go in the waterline.</i>

00:13.292 --> 00:15.358
<i>- Drag it out.</i>
- So smart.

00:15.441 --> 00:17.374
<i>It looks really good.</i>

00:18.012 --> 00:19.052
<i>It looks gorgeous.</i>

00:19.077 --> 00:20.418
Aah! Oh, my God!

00:20.443 --> 00:22.805
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

00:22.831 --> 00:24.545
<i> ...just keep it the regular cat eye</i>

00:24.570 --> 00:26.604
<i>The thing is that every guy
expects a cat eye</i>

00:26.861 --> 00:28.728
<i>so they're wondering why,
"Why is this reverse?</i>

00:28.753 --> 00:30.425
<i>What is happening?"
They're gonna want to...</i>

00:30.450 --> 00:32.924
<i>They won't ask because they're
a man and they don't know.</i>

00:32.949 --> 00:35.511
<i>But they could actually, like,
say what they think or feel.</i>

00:41.103 --> 00:42.336
Benji, Benji, Benji!

00:42.656 --> 00:44.323
Benji, Benji! Thank God you're here.

00:44.391 --> 00:45.523
I didn't want to have to break in

00:45.548 --> 00:46.897
and have your brother sue me again.

00:46.922 --> 00:49.133
It wasn't a lawsuit.
It was a cease and desist.

00:49.240 --> 00:50.826
And you don't have to break in.

00:50.851 --> 00:51.996
There's a hide-a-key rock.

00:52.021 --> 00:53.854
I don't touch rocks. You know that.

00:53.928 --> 00:55.134
Did you feel the earthquake?

00:55.176 --> 00:57.120
- Earthquake?
- Okay, look at this.

00:57.446 --> 00:59.346
"Seismic activity in the Salton Sea"

00:59.371 --> 01:00.958
indicates that a major earthquake

01:00.983 --> 01:03.489
in Southern California...
That's us, "Is significantly"

01:03.514 --> 01:05.647
more likely in the next 24 hours."

01:05.894 --> 01:07.927
I think that what I just
felt was a pre-shock.

01:08.002 --> 01:09.702
I'm from here. I've never
heard of a pre-shock.

01:09.727 --> 01:11.080
I think you're thinking of aftershock.

01:11.107 --> 01:12.819
I don't think either of us
knows what I'm thinking,

01:12.844 --> 01:15.208
but it's all the KIIS FM
radio DJs were talking about

01:15.233 --> 01:17.781
and they don't just waste their
time chatting about anything.

01:17.806 --> 01:20.091
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

01:20.116 --> 01:21.785
You listen to FM radio?

01:21.810 --> 01:23.810
Do you work in a toll booth?

01:23.978 --> 01:26.160
Okay, I didn't want to
have to tell you this,

01:26.185 --> 01:27.702
but here's the real situation.

01:27.802 --> 01:30.569
My boobs are hurting badly,
and you know that means

01:30.594 --> 01:32.107
something terrible's about to happen.

01:32.132 --> 01:33.572
Just like right before
when they announced

01:33.597 --> 01:35.134
<i>La La Land</i> won best picture.

01:35.159 --> 01:36.150
Your boobs are hurting 'cause

01:36.175 --> 01:37.468
you're gonna have your
period in two days.

01:37.493 --> 01:39.783
Oh, right. Well, fingers crossed.

01:40.121 --> 01:41.640
Look, this is how it works.

01:41.665 --> 01:44.014
Everyone moves here
thinking a big earthquake's

01:44.039 --> 01:45.714
gonna get in the way
of them being famous,

01:45.739 --> 01:47.267
and then neither the earthquake or fame

01:47.292 --> 01:48.991
ever happens to anybody.

01:49.576 --> 01:51.992
Cool, I'll just take
matters into my own hands.

01:52.017 --> 01:53.547
- What are you doing?
- Calling the zoo.

01:53.572 --> 01:54.692
I have to see if they're observing

01:54.717 --> 01:56.741
any odd animal behavior.

01:57.125 --> 01:59.297
Hi, yes, I'm a taxpayer.
I'm calling to see

01:59.322 --> 02:01.648
if you guys have any eyes
on the giraffes.

02:02.723 --> 02:05.033
Oh, they're sleeping, are they?

02:05.607 --> 02:07.084
Would you say that's
suspicious behavior

02:07.109 --> 02:10.376
that they're sleeping
in the middle of the day?

02:11.139 --> 02:12.822
Oh, you wouldn't?

02:14.575 --> 02:16.485
Why do you want to talk to my parents?

02:20.135 --> 02:21.899
I just downloaded this earthquake app

02:21.924 --> 02:23.277
that will give us a ten-second heads up

02:23.302 --> 02:25.989
before the big one
literally kills us all.

02:26.134 --> 02:27.844
Oh, my God. We're on red alert.

02:27.929 --> 02:30.141
Red, Benji. The color of blood.

02:30.198 --> 02:32.209
Your science background's
really spotty.

02:32.322 --> 02:33.630
Did they teach you Creationism

02:33.655 --> 02:34.822
in your Midwest high school?

02:34.847 --> 02:35.897
Take a video of me, quick.

02:35.922 --> 02:37.417
- Quick, quick, quick.
- Don't make me do this.

02:37.442 --> 02:39.455
We don't know how much
time we have left.

02:42.557 --> 02:44.305
Uh, cha-cha-cha. Other way, other way.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.832
Sorry.

02:46.135 --> 02:47.604
Hi, my name is Esther Povitsky

02:47.629 --> 02:49.696
and this is my last willing testament.

02:49.884 --> 02:52.215
Will and testament.

02:52.280 --> 02:54.430
This is my last w-will.

02:54.455 --> 02:55.943
This is my will. Whatever.

02:56.216 --> 02:57.777
When I die, which I expect to happen

02:57.802 --> 02:59.392
imminently in a massive earthquake

02:59.417 --> 03:01.283
<i>or much later in a different
massive earthquake,</i>

03:01.308 --> 03:03.308
<i>please bury me in the following.</i>

03:04.562 --> 03:06.414
The Juicy sweat suit
Britney Spears wore

03:06.439 --> 03:08.134
after her wedding,

03:09.184 --> 03:11.485
replica Heart of the Ocean necklace,

03:11.973 --> 03:14.974
and this rhinestone Von Dutch hat.

03:15.176 --> 03:16.623
- Got that?
- Yeah, I got it.

03:16.698 --> 03:17.831
And my lip kits I leave

03:17.859 --> 03:19.926
to the National Rheumatoid
Arthritis Society

03:19.951 --> 03:22.039
- because I'm selfless.
- Isn't it hard for people

03:22.064 --> 03:23.555
with arthritis to put on lipstick?

03:23.580 --> 03:26.256
Okay, send it to my parents
and CC It'sEstherBitch@gmail,

03:26.281 --> 03:29.044
- please and thank you.
- I love your white-trash box.

03:29.091 --> 03:31.012
- This is great.
- You're so lucky.

03:31.219 --> 03:32.336
You have no idea how many people

03:32.361 --> 03:34.595
would kill to see
what's inside this box.

03:34.916 --> 03:38.885
An Elvis-themed, banana-flavored
peanut butter cup?

03:38.947 --> 03:40.814
It's limited edition, okay?

03:40.839 --> 03:42.240
Those are never coming back.

03:42.265 --> 03:43.566
I'm saving it for the right time.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.285
It says 2004. That right time passed.

03:45.310 --> 03:46.850
Not the right time to eat them.

03:46.875 --> 03:48.285
The right time to sell them.

03:48.357 --> 03:50.257
These are an investment property.

03:51.105 --> 03:53.121
I feel like you and Elvis
have a lot in common

03:53.146 --> 03:55.046
'cause you'll also die in a bathroom.

03:55.502 --> 03:57.031
I like that.

03:57.232 --> 04:00.199
This candle smells like
Season 1 of <i> American Idol.</i>

04:00.262 --> 04:02.162
Probably smells like a urinal cake.

04:02.187 --> 04:04.187
Men are so gross.

04:04.272 --> 04:06.439
And then there's this.

04:06.615 --> 04:08.414
There you go. That's sensible.

04:08.474 --> 04:10.221
It's filled with rare lip tattoos.

04:10.278 --> 04:11.849
Okay, not sensible.

04:12.487 --> 04:14.657
Why'd you bring all this
garbage to my house?

04:14.843 --> 04:17.634
Benji, there's something
I haven't told you.

04:17.704 --> 04:18.803
Is this the story about how you

04:18.829 --> 04:20.189
diarrhead yourself at Coldstone?

04:20.214 --> 04:22.424
That was a solid poop.
It wasn't diarrhea.

04:23.470 --> 04:26.015
When I was little, a tornado came

04:26.040 --> 04:29.075
within 90 miles of my house.

04:29.556 --> 04:31.889
I know. It's scary.

04:31.986 --> 04:33.378
Isn't that really far?

04:33.403 --> 04:34.704
Ever since then I decided

04:34.729 --> 04:35.929
I would throw all my favorite things

04:35.990 --> 04:38.588
in one box so that
when disaster strikes

04:38.686 --> 04:39.821
I'll be ready.

04:39.867 --> 04:42.417
Well, when the apocalypse hits
and you're trying to trade

04:42.442 --> 04:44.308
your Britney merch for gasoline,

04:44.333 --> 04:45.486
I've got us covered.

04:45.547 --> 04:46.512
You have a Furby?

04:46.562 --> 04:47.594
Come on, let me show you.

04:48.109 --> 04:49.687
Suppli...

04:50.038 --> 04:51.984
Supplies.

04:53.127 --> 04:54.360
Oh, my God, you raccoon!

04:54.385 --> 04:55.947
You ate all the food!

04:55.972 --> 04:57.367
I didn't eat all of it.

04:57.399 --> 04:59.033
The creatine was too powdery.

04:59.113 --> 05:01.129
How do you go through 500 protein bars?

05:01.154 --> 05:03.716
- What are you, a teen mom?
- No.

05:04.277 --> 05:05.858
How did you get through the padlock?

05:05.916 --> 05:08.116
You use the same four-digit
code for everything.

05:08.603 --> 05:11.009
Sorry for being a friend
who pays attention.

05:11.059 --> 05:12.737
I think you need to
go back to food therapy.

05:12.803 --> 05:15.682
Okay, I see that you're
upset, and I understand

05:15.757 --> 05:18.558
because now that I think
about it, I'm upset, too.

05:18.583 --> 05:20.717
You should've been
maintaining your inventory.

05:20.742 --> 05:23.409
You have to keep an updated list.

05:23.434 --> 05:25.025
You are so short-sighted.

05:25.066 --> 05:28.101
If there's an actual crisis,
I can't even trust you.

05:28.126 --> 05:29.646
Everybody knows
I'm extremely trustworthy.

05:29.671 --> 05:31.061
Nobody thinks you're trustworthy.

05:31.086 --> 05:33.747
The only person who doesn't
is Sarah M., okay?

05:33.842 --> 05:35.395
But that was in junior high

05:35.420 --> 05:36.486
and she was kissing a teacher.

05:36.511 --> 05:38.810
I had no choice but to Linda Tripp her.

05:39.053 --> 05:41.236
- Benji!
- Oh, my God.

05:41.275 --> 05:42.531
My sister's here?

05:42.577 --> 05:44.610
See, a successful fashion CEO

05:44.635 --> 05:46.501
had the same emergency plan as me.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.377
I have one habit of a
highly-effective person.

05:49.524 --> 05:51.291
Is there anything on my teeth
or my eyebrows?

05:51.316 --> 05:53.416
I mean, besides
seventh-grader makeup, no.

05:53.441 --> 05:55.542
- Okay, let's go.
- Benji!

05:55.737 --> 05:58.404
- Did you guys feel a pre-shock?
- There's no such thing.

05:59.264 --> 06:00.532
Hey, Benj.

06:00.557 --> 06:02.994
Hanging out in the garage,
not strange at all.

06:03.111 --> 06:05.408
I mean, come on. Bill Gates, Tim Allen.

06:05.433 --> 06:06.973
Tons of cool guys hang out in garages.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.708
I'm just another cool guy in a garage.

06:08.873 --> 06:10.810
Alia, uh, your trip looked amazing.

06:10.835 --> 06:13.075
It's so cool that you made
it to Turks and Caicos.

06:13.100 --> 06:14.300
I mean, I've dreamed of going to one,

06:14.331 --> 06:15.846
but both, that's so cool.

06:15.904 --> 06:17.581
Yeah, it was a whirlwind, Cheryl.

06:17.673 --> 06:20.240
Actually, Cheryl's the name of
the turtle I had in college,

06:20.265 --> 06:22.022
- but great try.
- It doesn't matter.

06:22.047 --> 06:24.013
What's important is we're all here

06:24.038 --> 06:26.178
and we're all safe,
and we can all just, like,

06:26.203 --> 06:28.465
share our secrets because
the next stop is the grave.

06:28.490 --> 06:30.557
So let's get to know each
other better tonight.

06:30.699 --> 06:32.598
Oh, we're not staying.
We're going to the Malibu house

06:32.623 --> 06:34.407
to celebrate Vivian's retirement.

06:34.545 --> 06:36.478
I just turned 26. Kill me.

06:36.704 --> 06:37.803
It's time, girl.

06:37.828 --> 06:39.317
Age shaming is so hot right now.

06:39.461 --> 06:41.671
Clara actually made us
stop the car because she was

06:41.696 --> 06:43.937
having a weird breathing fit
while we were driving.

06:43.972 --> 06:46.409
I have anxiety about
the ground shaking so hard

06:46.434 --> 06:48.078
that it opens up
and swallows people whole.

06:48.103 --> 06:49.765
I have that, too. I really do.

06:49.790 --> 06:52.550
And I also have anxiety
about, um, dry drowning.

06:52.584 --> 06:54.150
Have you heard of it?
It's really scary.

06:54.175 --> 06:55.809
I saw an <i> Oprah</i> on it. It's so bad.

06:55.929 --> 06:57.487
I'm so scared.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.523
Everyone on Twitter is going crazy.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.658
Well, everyone in this
house is going rational,

07:01.827 --> 07:04.935
so I'd stay here and enjoy the shelter

07:04.960 --> 07:07.564
and safety, and there's no obligation

07:07.599 --> 07:09.850
to be my apocalyptic bride, FYI.

07:09.928 --> 07:12.473
You can ignore him.
He has a personality disorder.

07:12.538 --> 07:14.571
Um, here's what I know.
I called the zoo,

07:14.606 --> 07:17.014
and all the squirrel monkeys
are seeking higher ground

07:17.074 --> 07:18.724
which is actually an
interesting alert...

07:18.749 --> 07:19.872
Wait, you called earlier

07:19.897 --> 07:21.115
about giraffes, not monkeys.

07:21.140 --> 07:23.040
I called again and spoke
to a supervisor.

07:23.065 --> 07:25.454
She had the real intel.
Ask for Julie if you call.

07:25.517 --> 07:28.342
- She'll hook it up.
- I would not go to Malibu.

07:28.367 --> 07:31.494
If there is an earthquake,
everyone's gonna drown in a tsunami.

07:31.590 --> 07:33.295
I highly recommend hanging out

07:33.320 --> 07:34.491
and drowning in my protection.

07:34.526 --> 07:36.179
Easy, Benj. We're gonna get out of here

07:36.204 --> 07:38.026
once Clara calms down. Is Dean here?

07:38.051 --> 07:39.945
Do you see any coked-out
models anywhere?

07:39.970 --> 07:41.606
- Is Dean here?
- No, no.

07:41.631 --> 07:42.844
- He's not here.
- Perfect.

07:42.878 --> 07:44.543
I wanna grab that bottle
of his good tequila.

07:44.568 --> 07:45.696
- Where is it?
- Yeah, right.

07:45.721 --> 07:47.541
I can't tell you where that tequila is.

07:47.614 --> 07:50.060
This conversation alone
is enough for a penalty.

07:50.141 --> 07:52.233
- Benj.
- It's super-good tequila.

07:52.297 --> 07:54.330
It's really rare 'cause
the cartel that made it

07:54.406 --> 07:56.527
- all died in a shoot-out.
- Please.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.732
- No more spooky talk.
- Okay, you need to go lie down

07:59.757 --> 08:01.691
before you go all full
<i>Girl, Interrupted</i> on us.

08:01.720 --> 08:03.902
Viv, let's find this tequila
and then get out of here.

08:03.955 --> 08:06.184
- I wanna show up Dave Grohl.
- Come here.

08:06.357 --> 08:08.357
Dude, we need them to stay, okay?

08:08.427 --> 08:10.379
If the big one hits
do you think the rescuers

08:10.404 --> 08:12.395
are gonna come save us
if it's just you and me?

08:12.491 --> 08:15.186
No, but if there's
three fashion-forward

08:15.211 --> 08:17.485
Instagram influencers, we're safe.

08:17.517 --> 08:19.031
Okay, agreed. I like your plan.

08:19.057 --> 08:20.172
- Good.
- All right,

08:20.197 --> 08:21.630
this is something you
should know, though.

08:21.664 --> 08:23.798
Clara's been liking my Instagram posts,

08:23.823 --> 08:25.018
and I know you think I'm crazy,

08:25.043 --> 08:26.878
but I really think
she's about to follow back.

08:26.938 --> 08:29.446
You're gonna ruin this with
your sad, little elf moves.

08:29.481 --> 08:31.481
Oh, God. Okay, just look.

08:31.517 --> 08:33.378
Work with me, not at me.

08:33.431 --> 08:36.051
I'm gonna assume the role
of crisis entertainer...

08:36.111 --> 08:38.587
Role I was born to play. You
support me however possible.

08:38.624 --> 08:41.038
Fine, but don't sabotage
stuff with me and Clara.

08:41.097 --> 08:42.197
And please don't screw me over

08:42.232 --> 08:43.744
like you did with
the emergency supplies.

08:43.769 --> 08:45.272
I can't believe
you're still mad about that.

08:45.297 --> 08:47.194
Yeah, I'm mad about that. It
happened two minutes ago, man.

08:47.219 --> 08:49.214
Okay, well, I've forgiven
myself and I've moved on.

08:49.239 --> 08:51.139
I suggest you do the same.

08:51.308 --> 08:52.988
What was... what was that?

08:53.110 --> 08:55.077
I wanted to hit you, but I felt weird.

08:58.694 --> 09:00.087
So, I know it sounds pretentious,

09:00.112 --> 09:02.012
but I was just reading <i>The New Yorker,</i>

09:02.037 --> 09:03.354
and they had this whole thing

09:03.379 --> 09:05.575
about how fear can be an aphrodisiac,

09:05.622 --> 09:07.710
and people make really bad choices...

09:07.796 --> 09:09.950
Like when I stand
on a really high balcony

09:09.975 --> 09:12.943
and I think to myself,
"I could've been a pilot."

09:13.342 --> 09:16.161
Yeah, I think the article
was about that, too, sure.

09:16.212 --> 09:17.874
Anyway, do you have any Xanax?

09:17.974 --> 09:20.002
I could really go for some Xanny tea.

09:20.089 --> 09:21.982
- Xanny tea?
- Benj,

09:22.354 --> 09:23.596
give me the tequila.

09:23.685 --> 09:25.006
Otherwise I'm gonna hire every girl

09:25.031 --> 09:26.543
who's ever dumped you
as one of my interns.

09:26.568 --> 09:28.245
I mean, if you want
interns that can't read,

09:28.270 --> 09:29.685
that's on you, sister.

09:30.564 --> 09:31.933
Oh, my God, what is she wearing?

09:31.958 --> 09:35.432
Hey, guys, it's just me being regular.

09:35.598 --> 09:38.351
JK, limited-edition lip tattoo.

09:38.601 --> 09:40.600
Wh... are you wearing that as a joke?

09:40.649 --> 09:42.616
Why? Is it funny?

09:42.771 --> 09:44.571
Um, I bought it off a 12-year-old

09:44.607 --> 09:45.834
I met on Snapchat.

09:45.954 --> 09:47.808
It looks like you have herpes.

09:47.833 --> 09:49.530
Well, it's a conversation starter.

09:50.943 --> 09:53.289
Uh, uh, want one?

09:53.404 --> 09:55.381
Oh, thanks, maybe next time

09:55.451 --> 09:58.203
when we're headed to
a K-pop music festival.

10:00.276 --> 10:02.510
- That's funny.
- What are you doing?

10:02.535 --> 10:04.234
You look like a circus animal cookie.

10:04.259 --> 10:05.901
They're fashionistas. They're not...

10:05.979 --> 10:07.367
rebellious 12-year-olds.

10:07.517 --> 10:10.022
Are they not engaged?
They're entertained.

10:10.065 --> 10:11.388
So they won't leave.

10:11.412 --> 10:12.678
They're laughing at you.

10:13.108 --> 10:14.875
At me, with me. A laugh's a laugh.

10:14.900 --> 10:16.987
There's no need to be
<i>Precious</i> about it, okay?

10:17.067 --> 10:18.948
Look, are people laughing at Louis C.K.

10:18.973 --> 10:21.608
or are they laughing with him?
Who's to say?

10:21.644 --> 10:23.431
Look, people want to have
a little bit of fun

10:23.456 --> 10:25.180
in a scary time,
and I'm like that standup

10:25.205 --> 10:26.603
that went down with the <i> Titanic.</i>

10:26.628 --> 10:28.312
There wasn't a standup on the <i> Titanic.</i>

10:28.337 --> 10:30.137
You think the band went up cold?
Look it up.

10:30.162 --> 10:31.973
Esther, your mouth
is giving me a headache.

10:31.998 --> 10:33.780
Look, I'm an artist,
and I'm performing,

10:33.805 --> 10:35.822
and I need you to support me.
You gonna?

10:35.858 --> 10:37.609
- I always support you.
- But on the lip tattoo?

10:37.634 --> 10:39.175
Stop trying to make me
your gay best friend.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.537
- Please!
- No!

10:40.562 --> 10:42.696
I think my brain is feeling better.

10:42.731 --> 10:44.564
Oh, good. Great, okay.

10:44.600 --> 10:45.800
Your chakras are probably better, too.

10:45.825 --> 10:47.415
- All right, let's go.
- Hey, hey, hey.

10:47.440 --> 10:49.139
Um, I got a pitch. I'll tell you

10:49.164 --> 10:51.064
where the tequila is, but as insurance

10:51.089 --> 10:52.752
I need you to tell me
that I can move in with you

10:52.777 --> 10:54.708
- when Dean kicks me out.
- No.

10:55.050 --> 10:56.417
If I wanted a weird creature

10:56.442 --> 10:57.870
just wheezing
all over my couch every day

10:57.895 --> 10:59.270
I would get a French bulldog.

10:59.341 --> 11:00.866
It's time for the show-stopper.

11:01.093 --> 11:03.161
Let's go. Let's go.

11:03.579 --> 11:08.198
Hey, guys, um, I figured since
we're all gonna die tonight,

11:08.257 --> 11:09.740
that maybe you guys
could get to know me

11:09.765 --> 11:11.166
a little better real quick?

11:12.298 --> 11:14.298
- Oh, my God.
- This is so cute.

11:14.323 --> 11:15.439
That smells like <i>American Idol.</i>

11:15.464 --> 11:16.564
Is that a Tamagotchi?

11:16.589 --> 11:18.191
I saw this on an episode of <i> Hoarders.</i>

11:18.216 --> 11:20.792
- Tamagotchi.
- It's actually <i> Rugrats</i> Gigapet.

11:20.952 --> 11:22.669
Tamagotchi never did cross-promotion.

11:23.049 --> 11:24.320
But actually if you guys just...

11:24.345 --> 11:27.279
If you do take something out
put it back in its package.

11:28.490 --> 11:31.098
- Oh, my God.
- What happened?

11:31.140 --> 11:32.733
Was that an earthquake?

11:32.778 --> 11:35.295
Doesn't it for it to be
earthquake the ground shake?

11:35.370 --> 11:36.730
I can't even tell if
it was an earthquake.

11:36.755 --> 11:38.385
- There's no reception.
- I don't know.

11:38.410 --> 11:40.143
There's not really good
service in the hills,

11:40.168 --> 11:42.633
plus the blackout probably
took out the signal booster.

11:42.658 --> 11:45.130
All right, everybody. All right, um,

11:45.187 --> 11:46.984
there's no way to really know
what's going on out there

11:47.009 --> 11:51.057
but my guess is yes, most of
Los Angeles is probably on fire

11:51.103 --> 11:53.667
and roving motorcycle gangs
are forming as we speak.

11:53.995 --> 11:55.388
- Please.
- Oh, boy.

11:55.413 --> 11:57.048
I am not leaving this house.

11:57.073 --> 11:58.709
I have had too many bad experiences

11:58.734 --> 12:00.374
with roving motorcycle gangs.

12:00.456 --> 12:01.719
Absolutely, Clara, yes.

12:01.744 --> 12:02.788
More reason for you guys

12:02.813 --> 12:04.433
to just stay here with us.

12:04.733 --> 12:06.041
Wait, where's Esther?

12:06.101 --> 12:07.668
I'm here. I'm safe.

12:08.077 --> 12:10.844
Hey, country mouse,
let's get out of there.

12:10.907 --> 12:13.174
- Okay.
- Come on, there you go.

12:13.255 --> 12:16.323
All right, that's a girl.

12:16.862 --> 12:19.426
My whole life flashed before my eyes.

12:19.921 --> 12:21.495
And you know what I learned?

12:22.256 --> 12:24.324
I should've just had sex
with my hot cousin.

12:24.349 --> 12:26.961
I mean, nobody would've cared.

12:27.183 --> 12:28.783
Okay, that's an interesting takeaway.

12:28.808 --> 12:30.285
Listen up, there's no electricity

12:30.310 --> 12:31.811
so the driveway gate is not gonna open

12:31.836 --> 12:33.155
so we're all stuck here.

12:33.180 --> 12:34.512
I suggest we just have some food

12:34.537 --> 12:37.028
- and sort of settle our nerves.
- Yes.

12:37.294 --> 12:39.275
- Food is good.
- Awesome, great.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.368
So we're trapped here
with no phone and no internet.

12:42.530 --> 12:44.163
I mean, this is just like
that Russian guy's yacht

12:44.188 --> 12:46.522
- all over again.
- Do you guys wanna

12:46.547 --> 12:48.480
at least share hydration tips for fun?

12:48.604 --> 12:50.734
- Uh...
- Find that tequila.

12:50.759 --> 12:52.587
Yeah. -Tear up the
floorboards if you have to.

12:52.612 --> 12:53.953
You guys, does that mean...

12:53.978 --> 12:56.659
You think tequila...
Is tequila hydrating?

12:57.199 --> 12:58.945
So I'm sure most guys make you eggs,

12:58.970 --> 13:02.451
but do most guys make you fluffy eggs?

13:02.818 --> 13:03.933
That's what you should really

13:03.958 --> 13:05.658
be asking yourself when you eat these.

13:05.791 --> 13:07.562
How are pandas endangered?

13:07.743 --> 13:10.128
I see bamboo, like, everywhere.

13:10.212 --> 13:12.209
Your sister wants to try my spa water.

13:12.234 --> 13:14.209
- I'm so excited.
- Hey, super sorry,

13:14.234 --> 13:15.882
- but fridge is off-limits.
- No, it's not.

13:15.907 --> 13:17.229
What are you talking about?

13:17.286 --> 13:19.403
I've been brewing this for
three weeks from a Pinterest.

13:19.428 --> 13:21.295
Get out of my way.

13:24.660 --> 13:25.759
Come on.

13:25.933 --> 13:28.488
Whoa! Get up.

13:35.257 --> 13:37.424
Wait, why are the lights
on in the fridge

13:37.499 --> 13:39.711
- if the power is out?
- Okay,

13:39.771 --> 13:41.346
I turned all the power
off in the house.

13:41.371 --> 13:42.940
- You did this?
- Except for the kitchen

13:42.965 --> 13:44.544
'cause my brother's
truffles are in there

13:44.580 --> 13:46.425
and it's truffle season. I'm not crazy.

13:46.450 --> 13:47.515
Why didn't you tell me?

13:47.540 --> 13:49.046
I wanna be a part of cool plans.

13:49.071 --> 13:50.603
We were supposed to be
working together.

13:50.628 --> 13:53.036
This was our plan to
keep them here, remember?

13:53.156 --> 13:55.722
- You sold the danger.
- Really?

13:55.984 --> 13:57.432
Yeah, you were selling it, honey.

13:57.457 --> 13:58.979
Really, like how good?

13:59.032 --> 14:00.975
Wait, but that's because
I was really scared,

14:01.000 --> 14:02.796
- and you betrayed me.
- I didn't betray you.

14:02.831 --> 14:05.215
You betrayed me. You ate all
the emergency supplies.

14:05.393 --> 14:07.019
That's because you never
told me about them,

14:07.044 --> 14:08.351
which is another betrayal.

14:08.504 --> 14:09.971
Things are starting to add up for you

14:09.996 --> 14:11.830
and it's not looking good, man.

14:11.855 --> 14:13.175
Things are looking great. I look great.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.257
Oh, gosh!

14:15.410 --> 14:17.744
She's having a panic attack.
Do something!

14:24.287 --> 14:25.585
Make her stop!

14:27.830 --> 14:29.605
- What are you doing?
- I'm showing her.

14:29.630 --> 14:31.530
these doll dresses to calm her down.

14:31.709 --> 14:33.824
Okay, Clara, you can pick
anything you see

14:33.849 --> 14:35.706
- except for the pink one.
- Look, the lights are working.

14:35.736 --> 14:36.943
Yay, I'm like Prometheus.

14:36.968 --> 14:38.107
You don't know that reference,

14:38.132 --> 14:39.421
- but that's okay, yay!
- Stop.

14:39.446 --> 14:40.748
That's the worst idea ever.

14:40.773 --> 14:42.274
That's epileptic.

14:42.299 --> 14:43.591
Do you want the pink one?

14:43.616 --> 14:44.616
If you do I'll give it to you

14:44.641 --> 14:46.407
but you have to really want it.

14:46.547 --> 14:48.248
- Come on.
- It's not working.

14:48.273 --> 14:49.444
We lost her, man.

14:49.469 --> 14:50.750
We did everything we could.

14:50.804 --> 14:52.442
Oh, wow, okay.

14:53.141 --> 14:55.359
Benji living your best life.

14:55.384 --> 14:57.161
Okay, is she still freaking out?

14:57.391 --> 14:59.457
Hey, hey! Hi.

14:59.660 --> 15:01.726
This is all in your head, okay?

15:01.848 --> 15:02.957
Get it together, okay?

15:02.982 --> 15:04.882
You're a strong and powerful woman

15:05.092 --> 15:06.826
but if you don't snap
out of it right now

15:06.851 --> 15:08.384
I will drag you back
to the Nordstrom Rack

15:08.409 --> 15:09.830
that I pulled you from
and leave you there

15:09.855 --> 15:11.439
until plaid comes back in style.

15:11.843 --> 15:15.505
- Got it?
- Got it.

15:16.720 --> 15:18.160
Okay.

15:18.185 --> 15:19.435
- That was cool.
- Yeah.

15:19.492 --> 15:21.425
Super clutch.

15:21.575 --> 15:23.575
All right, let's get back
to making omelets and stuff.

15:23.717 --> 15:25.417
- Yeah.
- The lights are back on.

15:25.452 --> 15:26.925
We're getting out of here, but first

15:26.972 --> 15:29.421
where the hell is Dean's tequila?

15:29.547 --> 15:31.790
It's in the garage behind
the water skiing equipment.

15:31.875 --> 15:33.168
It's all yours.

15:33.240 --> 15:35.450
You're so inspiring, Alia.
What's your secret?

15:35.489 --> 15:37.021
You just have to know
how to motivate people

15:37.046 --> 15:39.384
- to do things for you.
- How do you do that?

15:39.466 --> 15:41.252
Find that tequila and I'll tell you.

15:41.354 --> 15:43.287
- Okay.
- I'll help you.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.211
- We're out of here.
- Wait, wait.

15:46.236 --> 15:48.380
- Don't go. Wait, wait.
- Come on, don't leave us.

15:48.742 --> 15:49.982
What about the earthquake?

15:50.119 --> 15:51.919
You guys have each other.

15:54.885 --> 15:56.185
I think if a big one hits

15:56.210 --> 15:58.344
we should just head
our separate ways, man.

15:58.572 --> 16:00.405
We can't even trust each other.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.422
I agree.

16:02.556 --> 16:03.970
I think I'm gonna kayak to Catalina.

16:03.995 --> 16:06.768
I went to summer camp there,
so there's, like, buffalo,

16:06.793 --> 16:08.608
and I know which leaves
to eat and stuff.

16:08.628 --> 16:10.468
I'll probably stick around here.

16:10.861 --> 16:13.204
Start my Norma Desmond phase.

16:13.378 --> 16:14.875
Guess this is probably goodbye.

16:14.900 --> 16:16.687
We're just both pieces
of garbage anyways.

16:16.712 --> 16:17.998
We'll do better without each other.

16:18.023 --> 16:19.658
Yeah, guess so.

16:21.869 --> 16:24.002
Oh, my God! Oh, my God,
it's the earthquake app.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.607
- Relax, man.
- We have ten seconds to live!

16:25.632 --> 16:26.698
- Relax.
- I'm going under!

16:26.723 --> 16:28.018
No, no, no, no, no, just chill.

16:28.043 --> 16:29.403
- Why? I'm scared!
- This is... oh, my God!

16:29.428 --> 16:30.499
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

16:30.524 --> 16:31.893
Don't go to Catalina.

16:31.918 --> 16:33.878
I think you should know that
I smelled your underwear once.

16:33.903 --> 16:35.613
I think you should know
that I watched you do it.

16:35.638 --> 16:37.761
- I did it twice.
- I know. I have it on film.

16:37.786 --> 16:38.818
How do you have it on film?

16:38.852 --> 16:40.139
I hid a camera in your room.

16:40.164 --> 16:41.230
Where's the camera?

16:41.255 --> 16:42.639
Some things go to the grave.

16:42.712 --> 16:44.235
Goodbye.

16:44.632 --> 16:46.337
You smell like zucchini.

16:46.373 --> 16:47.472
I know.

16:48.286 --> 16:50.408
Oh, Dean.

16:50.702 --> 16:52.003
What are you doing?

16:52.078 --> 16:53.444
I didn't know you were home.

16:54.375 --> 16:55.480
Yeah, I was upstairs watching

16:55.515 --> 16:57.998
<i>Million Dollar Listings</i>
marathon on my laptop.

16:58.038 --> 17:00.271
I gotta find out where
those dicks get their ties.

17:00.433 --> 17:02.199
I'm really glad you're here.

17:02.224 --> 17:03.858
Yeah, okay, cool. Not me.

17:03.883 --> 17:04.990
I'm not glad at all.

17:05.015 --> 17:06.949
What's with the... What are you guys...

17:06.973 --> 17:09.344
What is this <i> Eyes Wide Shut</i>
stuff going on here?

17:09.429 --> 17:11.773
I had to turn off all the electricity,

17:11.799 --> 17:13.527
but, uh, your truffles are cool, dude.

17:13.551 --> 17:14.818
And you couldn't reset the breaker?

17:14.843 --> 17:15.931
I mean, it's very easy. You know,

17:15.955 --> 17:17.432
a little ambition wouldn't kill you.

17:17.887 --> 17:19.825
I prefer the drama of candlelight.

17:19.853 --> 17:22.402
Why are you dressed like
an emancipated six-year-old?

17:23.328 --> 17:25.343
- You think?
- That's not a compliment.

17:26.358 --> 17:27.854
Whatever.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.424
I think I know what's going on.

17:39.449 --> 17:40.834
You guys have sex?

17:42.099 --> 17:43.472
No, we're just talking.

17:43.497 --> 17:44.931
- Yeah!
- Come on, dude.

17:44.956 --> 17:46.471
We were playing a game and talking.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.019
- Sex?
- We would never...

17:48.044 --> 17:50.211
- My dick is so dry, all right?
- Same.

17:50.248 --> 17:54.134
Okay, let me just...
Take it from me, okay,

17:54.159 --> 17:56.560
just do it. Just get it
over with, all right?

17:56.585 --> 17:57.780
'Cause one of two things
is gonna happen.

17:57.805 --> 17:59.940
It's either gonna help you
guys figure your stuff out,

17:59.965 --> 18:02.457
or you're gonna ruin and completely
destroy your friendship.

18:02.482 --> 18:04.349
Honestly, it's a win-win situation.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.251
And that's coming from me,
and I know my stuff.

18:06.286 --> 18:09.420
I prefer to be the only whiny
brat in my sexual encounters.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.061
Yeah, and I've heard her
having sex before,

18:11.086 --> 18:12.548
and it sounded like a dogsled race.

18:12.615 --> 18:16.207
It was just barky and sloshy noises.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.380
Oh, okay, man, all right.

18:18.445 --> 18:20.111
Just get it done, dude.

18:20.139 --> 18:22.339
And I wanna give you
a tip, though, Benji.

18:22.867 --> 18:25.270
Don't listen for a second.

18:25.497 --> 18:28.297
If she's a biter, let her be the biter.

18:28.355 --> 18:30.288
You don't be the biter.
Don't bite back.

18:30.377 --> 18:33.245
That's her thing, man. You're welcome.

18:34.914 --> 18:37.215
Look, I just want you to know...

18:38.121 --> 18:40.552
I felt your boner on me
when you hugged me.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.353
- Boner?
- Yeah, you definitely had

18:42.389 --> 18:43.860
at least a half boner.

18:43.885 --> 18:45.535
That was just residual
boner from Clara.

18:45.574 --> 18:46.848
It was old "residge" bone.

18:46.873 --> 18:49.410
I know boners, and that
was a fresh boner.

18:49.435 --> 18:50.814
What are you, a boner expert?

18:50.839 --> 18:52.574
- Yeah.
- If I got half a boner

18:52.599 --> 18:54.532
I would've knocked you
into another zip code.

18:54.575 --> 18:56.605
You know what kind of junk
I'm packing down there?

18:56.629 --> 18:58.256
- Yeah right.
- What do you mean, yeah right?

18:58.281 --> 19:00.247
I get fear boners. Don't
you read <i>The New Yorker?</i>

19:00.272 --> 19:02.750
- Yeah, I've read <i> The New Yorker.</i>
- Fear is an aphrodisiac.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.509
- It was a fear boner.
- Okay.

19:04.544 --> 19:06.377
I get fear boners. That's why
every girl I hook up with

19:06.413 --> 19:07.782
has DUI's. I like the risks.

19:07.807 --> 19:08.929
So you're attracted to me

19:08.954 --> 19:10.362
'cause you're scared of me?

19:10.387 --> 19:13.070
Is it my credit score
that turns you on?

19:13.126 --> 19:14.925
Do you know how many
tortilla chip crumbs

19:14.950 --> 19:16.681
I would have to get through
to get to your vagina?

19:16.706 --> 19:18.183
You think... How would I even do that?

19:21.718 --> 19:24.524
Three point seven. That's
what this is saying, 3.7.

19:24.677 --> 19:27.441
I survived the big one.

19:27.582 --> 19:29.713
Whoo! I'm famous!

19:29.817 --> 19:31.301
I mean, I wouldn't call it a big one.

19:31.326 --> 19:32.735
It's not even big enough to take out

19:32.760 --> 19:34.299
a Malaysian sweatshop.

19:34.388 --> 19:36.572
Dude, I said not to touch my tequila.

19:36.597 --> 19:39.162
I said not to touch my tequila,
and it's not there.

19:39.187 --> 19:40.787
And you're the only person
I told about it, okay?

19:40.812 --> 19:42.164
So you know what I'm gonna do?

19:42.189 --> 19:43.521
I'm gonna apply a penalty this week.

19:43.546 --> 19:45.546
Where's your Fred McGriff
autographed baseball bat?

19:45.571 --> 19:47.926
- I'm going to break it.
- Nice, but you actually

19:47.951 --> 19:49.675
already broke it
for a different penalty.

19:49.700 --> 19:52.061
Yes, I remember that.
Okay, where's your PlayStation?

19:52.165 --> 19:54.648
You broke that with the
Fred McGriff baseball bat

19:54.755 --> 19:57.403
before you... you broke
them all for penalties.

19:57.468 --> 20:00.579
Maybe you should
take it out on his friend.

20:02.784 --> 20:04.097
You know what I'm gonna do?

20:04.237 --> 20:06.127
I'm going to m-bate in your bed.

20:06.267 --> 20:07.366
Do you know what that means?

20:07.481 --> 20:09.385
I'm going to JO in your bed.

20:09.410 --> 20:10.504
Please don't do that.

20:10.529 --> 20:12.562
Like, in the bed or on the bed?

20:12.660 --> 20:15.427
- Come on!
- I have to go.

20:15.821 --> 20:17.194
- Where are you going?
- To read a book.

20:17.219 --> 20:18.654
You're not. Are you gonna listen?

20:18.679 --> 20:20.645
- Yeah.
- That's illegal.

20:20.735 --> 20:23.803
It's not illegal.
It's in the Bill of Rights.

20:24.026 --> 20:25.312
Dean, there's a hidden camera in there.

20:25.337 --> 20:26.469
Sock it all up!
