WEBVTT

00:01.836 --> 00:04.636
- I feel like
we should go somewhere.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.405
How about
the eastern shore?

00:06.440 --> 00:07.723
- Are the men coming?

00:07.758 --> 00:09.725
- I would love
for the men to come.

00:09.760 --> 00:10.926
- When I ask you to do
something, you go,

00:10.978 --> 00:12.644
"let me call your sister,"
and I'm like,

00:12.680 --> 00:14.263
what has she got anything
to do with it?

00:14.315 --> 00:17.883
My sister and my mom,
they do everything together.

00:17.902 --> 00:20.736
That's great and all,
but you have more children.

00:20.771 --> 00:23.355
- I want a better
relationship with my kids.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.275
- We're lookin' pretty good
for the music video.

00:28.746 --> 00:30.729
- Is chris gettin' paid
as a manager?

00:30.765 --> 00:32.414
- Not officially,
I don't think.

00:32.450 --> 00:34.750
- Why is it appropriate
to ask my mom

00:34.785 --> 00:36.285
who is paying the bills?

00:36.337 --> 00:37.569
- I wanted to show up
to something

00:37.588 --> 00:38.754
that wasn't low budget.

00:38.789 --> 00:40.305
- Your mama's low budget.
Watch your mouth.

00:40.341 --> 00:41.974
- Oh!
- Ooh.

00:42.009 --> 00:44.276
- Are you gonna invite
everybody to the girls' trip?

00:44.311 --> 00:47.262
- We should bring
our husbands, and your--

00:47.298 --> 00:48.547
your luggage
is gonna be there.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.248
- Ahh!

00:50.267 --> 00:51.784
- You're being
an asshole, wendy.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.185
- I'm not your child.
Don't yell at me.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.753
- (bleep) it, wendy.
- Oh, my god!

00:54.789 --> 00:56.055
- I'm so done.

00:59.326 --> 01:01.093
- The secret
to this pretty face

01:01.128 --> 01:03.796
is stayin' in the shade.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.798
- If you wanna pop off,

01:05.833 --> 01:08.600
I'll be happy
to get you adjusted.

01:08.619 --> 01:09.785
- I may keep you waiting,

01:09.820 --> 01:13.172
but trust me,
I'm worth it.

01:13.207 --> 01:16.041
- The only thing messier
than two boys is me.

01:17.578 --> 01:21.246
- My blessings are many,
and my patience is none.

01:22.349 --> 01:25.134
- This professor doesn't
just grade on the curve.

01:25.169 --> 01:27.136
She sets the curve.

01:27.171 --> 01:29.822
- The grand dame
can never be duplicated,

01:29.857 --> 01:32.091
imitated, or intimidated.

01:33.811 --> 01:38.831
♪♪

01:38.866 --> 01:41.033
- juju,
can you help me pack?

01:41.068 --> 01:43.819
Come on, babe.
You want a ride?

01:43.854 --> 01:46.071
- Yeah.
- Whoo!

01:46.107 --> 01:48.607
[laughing]
whoo!

01:51.078 --> 01:52.744
We hope you enjoyed
your ride.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.163
- Mom, where
are you going?

01:54.198 --> 01:55.948
- I'm going to
the chesapeake.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.449
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.120
Not 1,000 days,
just for a few days.

02:01.155 --> 02:03.005
- No!
- Look.

02:05.209 --> 02:06.842
You wanna come, too?
You gonna miss me?

02:06.877 --> 02:08.510
- Yeah, I wanna come, too.

02:08.546 --> 02:12.330
- Yeah, well, you guys are
gonna stay here with grandma.

02:12.349 --> 02:14.850
Before covid, we did have
a full-time nanny,

02:14.885 --> 02:17.769
but it's gordon's idea
to have mom keep the kids

02:17.805 --> 02:19.404
while we go to
the chesapeake.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.857
This is my first time
leaving my babies with mom

02:21.892 --> 02:24.726
for consecutive nights
in a row,

02:24.778 --> 02:27.062
and so
I'm a little scared

02:27.114 --> 02:28.780
because, you know,
I want my kids

02:28.816 --> 02:31.016
to be comfortable
with their grandma.

02:31.035 --> 02:33.869
You guys are gonna have
so much fun without us.

02:33.904 --> 02:35.454
- It's okay, jeremiah.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.289
- You don't wanna stay here
with grandma?

02:37.324 --> 02:39.458
- Yeah, I don't wanna stay here
with grandma.

02:39.493 --> 02:42.878
- Why? Why?
- Because I love you.

02:42.913 --> 02:45.363
- Oh, I love you, too.

02:45.382 --> 02:47.416
- So, let's be real
about it, okay?

02:47.468 --> 02:51.086
You and I have not been
on a trip together since when?

02:51.138 --> 02:54.423
New year's eve
2019-'20, right?

02:54.475 --> 02:56.091
- Yeah. So, you should
be excited about going.

02:56.143 --> 02:58.010
- My ideal trip is not
for me to go off

02:58.045 --> 02:59.845
with a bunch of people.
Half of 'em I don't know.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.180
- Okay.

03:01.215 --> 03:03.398
- So, am I excited
about going? No.

03:03.434 --> 03:05.567
Am I going to support you?
Absolutely.

03:05.603 --> 03:08.053
- Gordon doesn't like
couples trips

03:08.072 --> 03:09.221
'cause he doesn't
wanna be bothered

03:09.240 --> 03:11.556
with everybody else's,
like, sh--,

03:11.575 --> 03:13.358
but then he always has
a good time.

03:13.393 --> 03:16.195
Dude,
wait 'til you get there.

03:16.230 --> 03:17.412
Well, I think
you should be excited.

03:17.448 --> 03:18.897
- You know me.

03:18.916 --> 03:20.365
When I get out,
I can be a little extra.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.117
- Right.
So, let's have fun.

03:22.169 --> 03:24.253
- I'm gonna have
a good damn time.

03:24.288 --> 03:25.587
- Okay,
but I will tell you

03:25.623 --> 03:28.257
that there is definitely,
like, a "unh".

03:28.292 --> 03:29.925
Remember I told you
about the video shoot?

03:29.960 --> 03:30.792
- In the parking lot,
yeah.

03:30.844 --> 03:32.044
- And I told you
it was low budget.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.262
- Right.
- Okay.

03:33.297 --> 03:36.632
Candiace was, like,
upset at me.

03:36.684 --> 03:39.084
I wanted to show up to something
that wasn't low budget.

03:39.119 --> 03:40.686
- Your mama's low budget.
Watch your mouth.

03:40.721 --> 03:41.853
- Oh!
- Ooh.

03:41.889 --> 03:42.721
- Talk about me.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.439
Talk about whatever
I got goin' on,

03:44.475 --> 03:46.942
but don't bring anybody's mom
into the equation.

03:46.977 --> 03:49.645
- Oh, hell no.
- Oh, candiace.

03:49.697 --> 03:51.480
[laughing]

03:51.532 --> 03:55.450
if she decides that
she wants to move forward,

03:55.486 --> 03:57.653
I'm in a space
to move forward.

03:57.705 --> 04:01.323
If she decides she wants
to stay in high school,

04:01.375 --> 04:03.125
we can go all the way back
to high school.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.876
- That's between y'all.
I'm gonna have a good time.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.378
- I know,
but I will tell you.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.547
If she tries it again,
we're about to fight.

04:18.342 --> 04:21.760
- It looks so pretty.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.295
Should it come down more?

04:23.314 --> 04:25.797
I feel like that's good.

04:25.816 --> 04:27.816
Okay, let me get
our charcuterie.

04:31.689 --> 04:33.155
Don't you need a cracker?

04:33.190 --> 04:34.539
- No, I don't need
crackers.

04:34.575 --> 04:37.876
Too many carbs for me.
- Oh, it's drinking time?

04:37.911 --> 04:39.995
- Isn't it always?
- Yes.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.364
It's 4:23,

04:42.416 --> 04:44.499
so we have 30 minutes
to talk about business

04:44.535 --> 04:45.650
'cause that's the rule,
right?

04:45.669 --> 04:46.985
- Right, no business
after 5 o'clock.

04:47.004 --> 04:47.919
- Okay.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.289
- We should have the videos
back Friday.

04:50.324 --> 04:52.007
- Really?
- I think.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.875
- And I still get
my three edits, right?

04:53.927 --> 04:55.010
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.628
- I need two clips,

04:56.663 --> 04:59.014
so that we can send to omega
at e-one,

04:59.049 --> 05:01.400
just so she has an idea
of what we got goin' on.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.001
- I am an indie artist,

05:03.020 --> 05:05.220
so there's a lot
at stake for me

05:05.272 --> 05:10.175
as far as finding the
right label that has some cred.

05:10.194 --> 05:11.526
Like, e-one,

05:11.562 --> 05:14.196
they have some of the most
incredible artists--

05:14.231 --> 05:16.782
usher, k. Michelle,
brandy.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.484
I mean, it'd be literally
a dream come true.

05:19.519 --> 05:22.054
Like, I need to sign
yesterday, like, asap.

05:22.089 --> 05:24.456
- Right.
- Doing a distro deal,

05:24.491 --> 05:27.042
I can have control
of my music,

05:27.077 --> 05:29.044
my creative process...
- Right.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.329
- ...The vibe I wanna have.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.030
And they're there to help
with marketing...

05:32.049 --> 05:34.199
- Mm-hmm.
- ...And pushing the project.

05:34.218 --> 05:36.201
- Right, as long as
you're comfortable.

05:36.220 --> 05:38.637
- There is no backup plan.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.973
I'm baring my whole soul,
okay, including my areolas.

05:42.009 --> 05:45.060
That's how I feel with this
whole entire music journey.

05:45.095 --> 05:46.645
- I'm gonna support you.
- Yeah.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.979
- I'm gonna ask
a lotta questions,

05:48.015 --> 05:49.264
so don't get mad at me.

05:49.316 --> 05:51.683
Husbandger is a--
it's a very weird role.

05:51.718 --> 05:54.903
- I may cuss you out,
but if I need it,

05:54.938 --> 05:57.489
then, you know,
we'll go with it.

05:57.524 --> 06:01.276
Anyway, this party that
gizelle and robyn hosted,

06:01.328 --> 06:03.295
it was a lot.

06:03.330 --> 06:05.781
I walked in,
and they're already asking me

06:05.833 --> 06:10.786
about the music video,
and I was sitting next to mia.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.003
So, I asked her.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.589
I'm like,
"did you walk up to my mom

06:14.625 --> 06:16.625
without really
knowing her at all

06:16.677 --> 06:21.380
and ask her if my husband
was on the payroll?"

06:21.415 --> 06:24.933
she said she wasn't asking it
in a shady way.

06:24.968 --> 06:28.887
- I'm not really sure
what other kind of way there is

06:28.922 --> 06:30.522
to ask that question.

06:30.557 --> 06:36.978
- Oh, and then she sees fit
to refer to my music video

06:37.030 --> 06:38.763
as low budget.
- Oh.

06:38.782 --> 06:41.817
- So, I said, "well,
your mother's low budget."

06:41.869 --> 06:44.035
[scoffs]
- jesus.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.037
- And that escalated.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.439
- I wonder why.

06:47.458 --> 06:49.040
- She is always, like,

06:49.076 --> 06:52.961
"oh, everyone
is intimidated by me."

06:52.996 --> 06:56.681
I'm like, bitch, who wants
a big, ol' leaky booty,

06:56.717 --> 07:01.420
big, ol' fake, leaky lips,
a botched clitoris?

07:01.455 --> 07:06.091
Who is really intimidated
by a size 14 foot?

07:06.126 --> 07:08.143
It's now starting
to become a pattern

07:08.178 --> 07:11.012
of any time you feel
intimidated,

07:11.064 --> 07:12.981
or you feel out of place,

07:13.016 --> 07:17.152
you want to project that people
are intimidated by you.

07:17.187 --> 07:19.304
So, I referred to her
as a projector,

07:19.339 --> 07:20.822
and this is the projector.

07:20.858 --> 07:23.909
So, I'm projecting her
insecurities back onto her.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.896
[slowed down]
projection.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.120
That's 'cause a projector
looks like "chh-chh".

07:35.155 --> 07:36.588
- Yeah, it looks
one of those things.

07:36.623 --> 07:37.622
Did you ever have
one of those in school,

07:37.657 --> 07:39.508
overhead projectors?
- Yes.

07:39.543 --> 07:40.959
- Yeah, where the teacher
writes on the thing.

07:40.994 --> 07:43.962
- Yes. I'm just as old as you,
k-kind of, almost.

07:43.997 --> 07:47.048
- Not really but okay.
- Eight years, so yeah.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.099
In the meantime, though,

07:48.135 --> 07:52.854
the girls want us to take
a little couples trip

07:52.890 --> 07:53.805
and--
- couples trip?

07:53.841 --> 07:56.374
- We've never been
on a couples trip, ever.

07:56.410 --> 07:57.576
- Askale and dre,
are they gonna go?

07:57.611 --> 07:58.527
- Yeah.
- I like dre.

07:58.562 --> 07:59.978
I-- I'd like to hang out
with him some more.

08:00.013 --> 08:00.896
- I enjoy them.

08:00.948 --> 08:01.780
What y'all talking about?

08:01.815 --> 08:03.198
- We're just catching up,
just gossip.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.399
- You know, gossip.
- Oh.

08:04.451 --> 08:07.486
- Oh, the men.
- Gossip.

08:07.521 --> 08:10.705
Dre's like a very,
like, calm, quiet.

08:10.741 --> 08:13.041
- I feel like
I'm probably the loudmouth.

08:13.076 --> 08:16.211
Well, then there's
the other one.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.914
- Brother, you need
to control your wife.
She's out of control.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.415
- You should get the (bleep)
out of my face.

08:20.467 --> 08:21.917
- Shut the (bleep) up
and listen to what I'm saying.

08:21.969 --> 08:22.884
- Yo, what?

08:22.920 --> 08:24.553
- You're going down,
you stupid mother----er.

08:24.588 --> 08:25.887
- Bro, why?
- He ----in'--

08:25.923 --> 08:26.972
he ----in' touched me.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.224
- The bald white men bein'
the loudest in the room.

08:29.259 --> 08:30.976
- Well, you know.

08:32.513 --> 08:33.595
- Coming up next...

08:33.647 --> 08:35.780
- (bleep) you, mia!
- (bleep) you!

08:35.816 --> 08:37.649
- Oh! Oh!

08:51.398 --> 08:54.516
[doorbell rings]
- oh.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.520
Hi! Oh, I'm good.
- How are you?

08:58.555 --> 09:00.188
- Okay. Oh, my god, okay.
- I brought you an orchid.

09:00.224 --> 09:02.607
- That's so sweet.

09:02.643 --> 09:03.742
Do you want me
to take something?

09:03.777 --> 09:05.143
- No, that's okay.
- You sure?

09:05.178 --> 09:06.194
- Yeah, I got my,
you know, my setup.

09:06.230 --> 09:07.445

31:21.030 --> 31:22.963
they're older men who lived.

31:22.998 --> 31:25.782
They've done the monogamy
with the one wife,

31:25.834 --> 31:27.634
and the-the spouse,
and the kids.

31:27.670 --> 31:28.568
- Mm-hmm.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.203
- And they--
that's not them.

31:30.238 --> 31:31.905
They don't want that life.
So, then--

31:31.941 --> 31:32.606
- what they want,
is something different.

31:32.641 --> 31:33.340
- Oh, wait,
what's going on?

31:33.375 --> 31:34.374
Why are y'all
in my damn room?

31:34.409 --> 31:37.477
- This is my room, bitch.
Your room is over there.

31:37.513 --> 31:38.478
- What are y'all
talking about?

31:38.514 --> 31:40.264
- We're talking about,
uh, captain save a ho.

31:40.299 --> 31:41.114
- So...

31:41.150 --> 31:42.132
- He's doing
a little bit much.

31:42.184 --> 31:45.102
I can see it going left
if he's already there.

31:45.137 --> 31:45.953
- Mm-hmm.

31:45.988 --> 31:47.253
- And I don't want it
to go left.

31:47.273 --> 31:48.772
I want us all to
have a good time.

31:48.807 --> 31:50.090
- You need to talk
to your friend, mia.

31:50.109 --> 31:51.491
Tell mia to give
him some water.

31:51.527 --> 31:53.310
- I had run it yesterday
for today.

31:53.362 --> 31:54.778
[laughing]

31:54.813 --> 31:56.446
- okay,
whatever works for ya.

31:56.482 --> 31:59.066
- But-- but-- so, uh,
understand and believe.

32:02.771 --> 32:03.603
Excuse me.

32:03.622 --> 32:05.122
- He says exactly
what he's thinking,

32:05.157 --> 32:06.139
which is great.
- Yeah.

32:06.175 --> 32:07.207
Girl, he said exactly
what he was thinking.

32:07.242 --> 32:09.309
Downstairs, he told mia
to shut the (bleep) up.

32:09.345 --> 32:11.128
- Somethin' at home
is not right because--

32:11.163 --> 32:11.962
- she goes hard.

32:11.997 --> 32:13.113
- You guys think
there's something--

32:13.132 --> 32:15.465
is because of her relationship,
her dynamic, with g.

32:15.501 --> 32:16.833
- Absolutely.

32:16.885 --> 32:19.953
It is interesting that
you've got

32:19.989 --> 32:23.473
this huge gap in age
between g and mia.

32:23.509 --> 32:27.144
So, it-it's kind of
giving daddy-daughter.

32:27.179 --> 32:29.429
I mean, red--
it's a red flag to me.

32:29.464 --> 32:31.431
- I'm gonna go find our room
'cause I owe you

32:31.466 --> 32:33.133
some really good sex tonight
for my g-wagon, don't I?

32:33.152 --> 32:34.267
- Oh, my.

32:34.303 --> 32:35.519
- She met him
in the strip club,

32:35.571 --> 32:37.070
and she found her
a high roller.

32:37.106 --> 32:38.772
- Ladies!

32:38.807 --> 32:40.073
- Oh.
- Are you talking sh--?

32:40.109 --> 32:40.857
- Oh, I don't care.

32:40.909 --> 32:41.658
- We were just
talking about you.

32:41.694 --> 32:42.609
- Yes, we are
talking about you.

32:42.645 --> 32:44.177
- Did g tell you to
shut the (bleep) up?

32:44.213 --> 32:45.445
- Probably.

32:45.481 --> 32:46.713
- You guys talk to
each other like that?

32:46.749 --> 32:48.532
- Yeah.
What's wrong with that?

32:48.584 --> 32:50.851
- I mean, you can do that
but not in mixed company

32:50.886 --> 32:52.035
'cause chris and I
do that all the time

32:52.087 --> 32:54.655
but not in mixed company.

32:54.690 --> 32:55.656
- I don't have an issue.

32:55.691 --> 32:57.341
Okay, what else are you
guys talkin' about?

32:57.376 --> 32:58.175
- I don't know what they
were talking about

32:58.210 --> 32:59.042
before I got here,

32:59.094 --> 33:00.544
but I was just
explaining how this trip

33:00.596 --> 33:02.512
can serve as a conduit
for everyone,

33:02.548 --> 33:03.930
not just you and candiace,
but me.

33:03.966 --> 33:04.798
- Yeah.

33:04.833 --> 33:06.383
- You have shared
with me the history

33:06.435 --> 33:07.601
between you and your mom.

33:07.636 --> 33:08.635
- Yeah.
- I have--

33:08.670 --> 33:09.836
I haven't told them
what it is.

33:09.855 --> 33:10.804
- Okay.

33:10.839 --> 33:12.189
- Well, what does that
have to do with me?

33:12.224 --> 33:13.690
- Because of the comment.

33:13.726 --> 33:14.808
- Oh, when I said
your mother.

33:14.843 --> 33:15.692
- Yeah.

33:15.728 --> 33:17.744
- Well, I-I said that
because I first

33:17.780 --> 33:22.449
was responding to
your comments to my mom.

33:22.484 --> 33:25.685
- So, I asked her
who is in charge here

33:25.704 --> 33:27.704
because for me as a ceo,
I always--

33:27.740 --> 33:29.756
that's my job
to identify the problem.

33:29.792 --> 33:30.957
- So, you-- but what--
but there-there is also--

33:30.993 --> 33:31.708
- 'cause you have
to identify the problem

33:31.744 --> 33:32.592
in order to
find the solution.

33:32.628 --> 33:33.760
- There's also reading
the room, mia.

33:33.796 --> 33:34.628
- Right.

33:34.663 --> 33:35.796
- And that's
the wrong time and place.

33:35.831 --> 33:36.963
- I was connecting
with her.

33:36.999 --> 33:37.964
- And that's wonderful.
I-I still--

33:38.000 --> 33:41.468
- I aspire to hopefully
be someone like her

33:41.503 --> 33:42.636
and how she mothers you.
- Well, she-she--

33:42.671 --> 33:43.587
she wasn't found
in the strip club,

33:43.639 --> 33:45.639
but, yes, you can be
like her if you want to.

33:45.674 --> 33:47.424
- And I made a lot of
money, honey, okay?

33:47.476 --> 33:49.226
- Very good.
I know g made it rain on you,

33:49.261 --> 33:51.712
and that's wonderful.
- He sure did.

33:51.747 --> 33:52.763
- Here's what I think.

33:52.815 --> 33:54.564
As the guys, right,
we're just cool.

33:54.600 --> 33:55.766
We're just chill
and relaxed.

33:55.818 --> 33:56.600
- Right.
- And you become friends,

33:56.652 --> 33:57.734
and you meet,
and you wanna hang.

33:57.770 --> 34:00.053
And then, next thing you know,
my wife and your wife,

34:00.072 --> 34:01.571
they are-they are
----in', like, buttin' heads.

34:01.607 --> 34:02.739
Like, (bleep),
well, I like you.

34:02.775 --> 34:03.740
Like, I--
- I'm saying that's y'all--

34:03.776 --> 34:04.658
that's y'all problem,
chris and I are good.

34:04.693 --> 34:05.442
- Right? Exactly.
- It's y'all problem.

34:05.494 --> 34:06.443
- Fine.
- Mia thought I was gonna

34:06.495 --> 34:08.662
be upset when candiace
said I was low budget.

34:08.697 --> 34:10.797
Really? Ha!
That'some funny sh--.

34:10.833 --> 34:11.782
- Right.

34:11.834 --> 34:14.951
- You then made a comment
about my music video

34:15.003 --> 34:16.103
being low budget.

34:16.138 --> 34:17.838
I don't know if that was
just a moment you were having.

34:17.873 --> 34:19.706
You were feeling yourself.
- No, that's business.

34:19.741 --> 34:21.407
- But I would never walk into
your place of business

34:21.427 --> 34:23.043
and call your sh--
low budget.

34:23.078 --> 34:24.127
- Take it as
constructive criticism.

34:24.179 --> 34:25.112
- Yes, yes.

34:25.147 --> 34:26.713
No, ma'am. No, ma'am.
- It-it's business.

34:26.748 --> 34:28.248
- Um, can I
interject real quick?

34:28.267 --> 34:29.082
- No.

34:29.118 --> 34:29.883
- This is not
a business meeting.

34:29.918 --> 34:30.851
This is not
a business retreat.

34:30.886 --> 34:33.153
We are friends trying
to have a good time!

34:33.188 --> 34:35.439
Why does everything have
to be about business?

34:35.474 --> 34:37.657
Father god!

34:37.693 --> 34:39.626
- Oh, this is cute.
- This is really cute.

34:39.661 --> 34:40.727
Are we close?

34:40.763 --> 34:42.028
Oh, we're 15 minutes away.

34:42.064 --> 34:42.762
- Mm-hmm.

34:42.781 --> 34:46.066
I am so ready
for a nice time.

34:46.101 --> 34:47.601
- You have low budget.
We have high budget.

34:47.636 --> 34:49.435
- I did not invite you--
I did not invite you

34:49.455 --> 34:52.105
to my event to
criticize my sh--.

34:52.124 --> 34:53.290
- I wasn't criticizing.
I was asking you a question.

34:53.325 --> 34:55.976
- You were found
on the curb by a pimp,

34:56.011 --> 34:57.777
but I would never
say those things

34:57.796 --> 34:58.995
because it's not
my business.

34:59.047 --> 34:59.830
- But you did.
- So, if I invite you--

34:59.882 --> 35:01.498
if I--
- and my mom was low budget,

35:01.550 --> 35:02.849
if you don't know.
- If this is what you say,

35:02.885 --> 35:04.000
that's what you say.
- You said it.

35:04.052 --> 35:05.502
You said it.
- Y-yes-- yes, I did.

35:05.554 --> 35:06.553
- And you don't
know my mom.

35:06.588 --> 35:07.687
- Your mother-- and you
don't know mine, either.

35:07.723 --> 35:08.555
You see how that works?

35:09.758 --> 35:10.657
- Yeah, I'm fine, girl.
- That was wrong.

35:10.692 --> 35:11.525
Why you checking on her?

35:11.560 --> 35:14.010
- I'm checking on her
because I know

35:14.062 --> 35:17.531
how it feels to have
two people on you

35:17.566 --> 35:18.665
on the trip.
- I'm used to this.

35:18.700 --> 35:20.100
- You know what I'm saying?
- I'm used to children.

35:20.135 --> 35:21.768
- Yes.
- You guys have to understand.

35:21.803 --> 35:25.338
- However, she's had more
than this on her at one time,

35:25.374 --> 35:27.274
and I came to her rescue.

35:27.309 --> 35:29.276
- Who the (bleep) cares
how many businesses

35:29.311 --> 35:31.144
anybody has in this room?

35:31.163 --> 35:33.346
- Hi, hello.

35:33.382 --> 35:34.281
All right.

35:34.316 --> 35:36.583
This is not gonna get
solved here today.

35:36.618 --> 35:40.003
And she still can sit here
with her big-ass feet

35:40.038 --> 35:41.538
and say that my sh--
is low budget.

35:41.590 --> 35:43.206
- What is wrong with
my big-ass feet?

35:43.258 --> 35:45.559
I like my big-ass feet.
- And-and she can do that.

35:45.594 --> 35:46.676
So, don't check on her.
- I was born--

35:46.712 --> 35:48.044
god gave me
these big-ass feet.

35:48.096 --> 35:49.679
- And god made
you basic, too.

35:49.715 --> 35:51.731
- He did.
- Jesus!

35:51.767 --> 35:52.799
Amen!
- But I--

35:52.835 --> 35:53.967
but I will continue to go
back to the fact that--

35:54.002 --> 35:56.269
- jesus! Gvo!

35:58.023 --> 35:59.505
- When the women
get into their issues--

35:59.525 --> 36:00.724
- I know.
It's funny sh--.

36:00.776 --> 36:02.559
Just smile and wave, boys.
- Come on.

36:02.611 --> 36:03.693
- Yes.
- Let's just take a break.

36:03.729 --> 36:04.811
Let's just take a break.

36:04.847 --> 36:05.562
- Excuse me if I pause.
My best friend is calling.

36:05.614 --> 36:06.396
- You-you should
excuse yourself

36:06.448 --> 36:07.447
with your flawed ass.
- Hey, baby.

36:07.482 --> 36:09.065
- You should excuse yourself.
- Hey, sweetie.

36:09.117 --> 36:10.283
- Hi, honey.
- Ys,

36:10.319 --> 36:11.518
and she's gotta
take calls

36:11.553 --> 36:12.369
because she can't handle
the situation.

36:12.404 --> 36:14.704
- Okay.

36:14.740 --> 36:16.856
Let's just take a break.
- My stuff is in here.

36:16.875 --> 36:18.241
This is my room.
- Yes, yes.

36:18.293 --> 36:19.793
- Yes, listen.

36:21.830 --> 36:25.382
- My beautiful bombshell,
smart, rich friends

36:25.417 --> 36:26.800
can understand me.

36:28.136 --> 36:30.370
- Oh, yes. Your mother
is a broke bitch.

36:30.389 --> 36:32.138
Do your night walk,
nightwalker!

36:32.174 --> 36:33.807
- What'd you say?
- Nightcrawler,

36:33.842 --> 36:37.227
get your dog
on the way down, bitch.

36:40.214 --> 36:42.249
♪♪

36:42.284 --> 36:43.583
- all right.

36:43.619 --> 36:45.902
- Very grand.
- Yes, it is.

36:45.938 --> 36:46.903
Oh!
- Oh!

36:46.939 --> 36:48.154
Oh, we might blow away.

36:48.190 --> 36:49.389
Ahh!
- You good?

36:49.408 --> 36:50.907
- I don't know.

36:50.943 --> 36:52.826
- I'm going in.

36:52.861 --> 36:54.694
Ahh, whew.

36:54.729 --> 36:56.363
Hello?

36:56.398 --> 36:58.298
- Ahh! Hold on!

36:58.333 --> 37:00.166
- People who
get me are here.

37:00.202 --> 37:01.868
- Oh, my god,
they're here!

37:01.903 --> 37:03.803
- Do you see-- but do you
see what I'm saying?

37:03.839 --> 37:05.171
- Hello!
- Hey, bitch!

37:05.207 --> 37:06.940
[screaming]

37:06.975 --> 37:08.908
- oh, no, jesus.

37:08.927 --> 37:11.094
- Oh, my god!

37:11.129 --> 37:13.580
- How are you?
- Oh, my god, we made it.

37:13.615 --> 37:14.881
Cute, cute.
- Girl, you gotta twirl for us.

37:14.916 --> 37:16.182
Yes.

37:16.218 --> 37:18.351
- Twirl me straight
to the ladies room.

37:18.387 --> 37:20.186
- This way here.
- Perfect.

37:20.222 --> 37:22.639
- I am super excited
that karen is here.

37:22.691 --> 37:25.942
Finally, somebody
who gets me

37:25.978 --> 37:29.946
and who has class
versus candi-ass.

37:29.982 --> 37:31.781
- Ashley, ashley.
- Hi.

37:31.817 --> 37:33.400
How are you?
- Aww.

37:33.435 --> 37:34.734
Ashley, what is that?

37:34.769 --> 37:36.369
- This is my family.

37:36.405 --> 37:38.238
I had to bring a picture.
- Aww.

37:38.273 --> 37:39.605
- Yeah, I'll just
put it in my room.

37:39.625 --> 37:40.974
How are you?
- You're so corny, I love it.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.275
[laughing]

37:42.311 --> 37:44.744
- candiace, askale,
come here, please!

37:44.779 --> 37:46.680
- Ashley!
- Hi, g.

37:46.715 --> 37:48.114
How are you?
- He's very drunk.

37:48.150 --> 37:50.717
- Oh.

37:50.752 --> 37:51.951
[laughing]

37:51.970 --> 37:53.219
- good to see you, sweetie.
- Exceptionally above average.

37:53.255 --> 37:54.087
- How are the kids doin'?

37:54.122 --> 37:55.288
- Very good.
- Did you bring the baby?

37:55.307 --> 37:56.640
- No, I didn't.
- Ashley.

37:56.675 --> 37:58.391
- Yeah, my husband
has him.

37:58.427 --> 37:59.976
Hello. Hi.
How are you? Hi.

38:00.012 --> 38:01.978
- It's time for rooms!

38:02.014 --> 38:03.596
I am happy
everyone is here.

38:03.632 --> 38:05.148
- The hostess is speaking.

38:05.183 --> 38:06.566
- Welcome to
ashley and karen.

38:06.601 --> 38:08.902
In your room, you will
have gift baskets.

38:08.937 --> 38:11.804
All of the items in here are
from black-owned businesses,

38:11.823 --> 38:13.490
and then the newest
black-owned business.

38:13.525 --> 38:14.991
- Yes.
- My candle.

38:15.027 --> 38:16.776
- Yes.

38:16.811 --> 38:19.162
Okay, girl power.
We can do this.

38:19.197 --> 38:20.447
Maybe wendy and I
will be in bloomingdale's

38:20.482 --> 38:21.865
together one day.
We'll see.

38:21.917 --> 38:22.982
You never know.

38:23.001 --> 38:24.584
She-she's growing.

38:26.038 --> 38:27.337
- It's time for
room assignments.

38:27.372 --> 38:29.005
- Oh, dear.

38:29.041 --> 38:30.373
- Brace ourselves.

38:31.710 --> 38:34.344
- Whoa, whoa.
What about me?

38:34.379 --> 38:35.628
- Baby, stand by me.

38:35.663 --> 38:36.863
They may come for me,
so I need you here.

38:36.898 --> 38:38.031
- Support, support.

38:38.066 --> 38:39.265
[laughing]
- oh, lord.

38:39.301 --> 38:40.600
- Oh, my god.

38:40.635 --> 38:42.435
- Okay, what
I'm thinking is,

38:42.471 --> 38:44.170
I would like for
the first people

38:44.189 --> 38:46.973
to pick their rooms
to be...

38:47.008 --> 38:48.308
Karen.
- Oh.

38:48.343 --> 38:49.693
- And askale.
- Oh.

38:49.728 --> 38:51.844
- And the reason
I say that is because.

38:51.863 --> 38:54.347
- Thank you.
- We were in the cottage crew.

38:54.366 --> 38:56.516
- Ah!
You are so shady.

38:56.535 --> 38:57.784
- Yes, we were.
- The help quarters.

38:57.819 --> 38:58.918
The help quarters.

38:58.954 --> 39:01.187
- After the cottage crew,

39:01.206 --> 39:03.239
I would like for
ashley to pick a room.

39:03.291 --> 39:04.290
- Okay.
- Thank you.

39:04.326 --> 39:06.292
- Ashley, I know it took
a lot for you to be here.

39:06.328 --> 39:08.044
Anything you need,
anything you want,

39:08.080 --> 39:09.462
we are here
to support you.

39:09.498 --> 39:10.830
- Thank you.
That's very nice.

39:10.865 --> 39:13.800
- After ashley...

39:13.835 --> 39:16.302
I would like for mia
to pick a room.

39:16.338 --> 39:18.371
- Ooh.
- So, I'm last.

39:18.390 --> 39:21.057
Th-this is shade because
I put her in the cottage.

39:21.093 --> 39:23.009
- Candiace, you did say--
- yes.

39:23.044 --> 39:25.044
- Mia, we wanted you to feel
welcome in this group.

39:25.063 --> 39:27.063
- I did-- past tense.

39:28.817 --> 39:31.084
- Next, after mia,
is candiace.

39:31.119 --> 39:33.553
- Oh, good and last.
[laughing]

39:33.572 --> 39:35.772
- afterthought.

39:35.824 --> 39:38.241
- And then gizelle and robyn,
if they come,

39:38.276 --> 39:40.076
they can pick
whatever room they like.

39:40.112 --> 39:41.828
Sounds good?
- Very good.

39:41.863 --> 39:43.079
- Let me grab my stuff
and go pick my room.

39:43.115 --> 39:44.080
- Their baskets are here.

39:44.116 --> 39:45.532
- You all right?
- Yeah.

39:45.567 --> 39:47.000
- What's going on?

39:47.035 --> 39:49.069
- Just this girl--

39:49.104 --> 39:50.503
- what is in my eye?

39:50.539 --> 39:52.238
- A eyelash.
- What happened?

39:52.257 --> 39:54.541
- She is mean.

39:54.576 --> 39:56.943
- I'm literally
standing right here.

39:56.978 --> 39:58.878
So, if you're gonna
call me mean...

39:58.913 --> 40:00.296
- I said you're mean.
- You might as well invite me

40:00.348 --> 40:01.581
into the conversation.
- Oh, sh--.

40:01.616 --> 40:02.649
- You can come if you want to.
- Oh, lord.

40:02.684 --> 40:04.684
- Oh, let's-let's do it.
Let's do it.

40:04.719 --> 40:06.436
- I'm gonna head out back.

40:06.471 --> 40:08.421
- I just asked
what happened, that's all.

40:08.457 --> 40:09.606
- I'm just heading
out back here.

40:09.641 --> 40:11.891
- I heard you say
that I was mean.

40:11.926 --> 40:13.526
- Mia, I don't believe
that you called us

40:13.562 --> 40:15.528
broke bitches
when you walked off.

40:15.564 --> 40:17.280
- You did.
You walked through us,

40:17.315 --> 40:18.281
and you said--
- no, I didn't.

40:18.316 --> 40:19.299
- Yes, you did.

40:19.334 --> 40:22.435
- My beautiful bombshell,
smart, rich friends

40:22.471 --> 40:24.103
can understand me.

40:24.122 --> 40:25.655
- Oh, yes.

40:25.707 --> 40:27.574
Yes, your mother
is a broke bitch.

40:27.609 --> 40:28.741
Let's address
the real issue.

40:28.776 --> 40:29.742
- Oh, god.
- The elephant in the room

40:29.777 --> 40:31.494
is that you need
to go to therapy.

40:31.546 --> 40:32.745
[gasps]
- okay.

40:32.780 --> 40:34.998
- Because you have
a problem with people

40:35.050 --> 40:36.782
who aren't where you are.

40:36.802 --> 40:38.117
- I don't have
the problem.

40:38.136 --> 40:39.619
- Classism, classism.

40:39.638 --> 40:41.337
- You are constantly
reminding everyone

40:41.389 --> 40:42.555
of how much money make,

40:42.591 --> 40:43.506
that you only deal
with high rollers.

40:43.558 --> 40:44.474
- You should be proud
of it, black woman.

40:44.509 --> 40:47.894
- But listen, don't do
the hand in my face.

40:47.929 --> 40:48.928
You did that to this one.
- I did the hand.

40:48.963 --> 40:50.263
What are you gonna do?
- Don't do it in my face.

40:50.298 --> 40:51.364
Don't go there with me.

40:51.399 --> 40:52.632
You just got here,

40:52.651 --> 40:54.400
and you barely made it in.

40:54.436 --> 40:55.135
So, watch your
mother----ing mouth.

40:55.170 --> 40:56.569
- Honey, you keep
saying that,

40:56.605 --> 40:57.687
but, quite frankly...
- No, honey.

40:57.739 --> 40:58.688
- I don't give two sh--s about
making it into anywhere.

40:58.740 --> 40:59.906
- I know you don't.

40:59.941 --> 41:00.907
- Because I've already made it.
- I know you don't.

41:00.942 --> 41:02.442
So-so, you can walk
your night crawling ass

41:02.477 --> 41:03.543
out of the room.

41:03.578 --> 41:04.377
- I have no problems
with you.

41:04.412 --> 41:06.162
- No, but-but you're
disrespectful,

41:06.198 --> 41:07.330
is your problem.
- I don't care.

41:07.365 --> 41:08.531
- And somebody needs to tell
you what the (bleep) to do

41:08.583 --> 41:09.716
and where to go.

41:09.751 --> 41:10.917
- What's up, man?
- Who is up for pool?

41:10.952 --> 41:12.185
- Oh, yeah, I am.

41:12.220 --> 41:13.586
I'll shoot some.
I suck, though.

41:13.622 --> 41:14.654
I suck at pool.

41:14.689 --> 41:15.722
- Where is your pimp?

41:15.757 --> 41:17.457
- Calm down.
- Where is your pimp?

41:17.492 --> 41:18.691
- Pimp, where you at?
The ho is here!

41:18.727 --> 41:19.759
- Yes, where is your pimp?

41:19.794 --> 41:21.511
- Your ho has
----in' arrived!

41:21.546 --> 41:22.529
- Yeah, go drop it like
it's hot for your pimp.

41:22.564 --> 41:23.863
- Pimp? Pimp? Pimp?

41:23.899 --> 41:25.048
- 'cause he needs to
put you back in line.

41:25.100 --> 41:25.732
- Okay, there is my pimp.

41:25.767 --> 41:26.599
Hi, pimp. Hi, pimp.
- G,

41:26.635 --> 41:27.333
tell her to shut
the (bleep) up, again.

41:27.369 --> 41:29.669
- How ya doin', pimp?
Come on.

41:29.688 --> 41:30.904
- Where we goin'?
- Oh, my lord.

41:30.939 --> 41:31.771
- Hey, pimp.

41:31.806 --> 41:33.139
- She is hungry.
Feed her.

41:33.175 --> 41:34.908
- I'm so ----ing thirsty.
- Here, do you need--

41:34.943 --> 41:36.643
do you need--
do you need a--

41:36.678 --> 41:38.077
do you need some lettuce?
- Oh, my god.

41:38.113 --> 41:38.811
- You need to grow up.

41:38.847 --> 41:40.480
- You started with me.
- No.

41:40.515 --> 41:42.482
- And you need to
learn how to finish.

41:42.517 --> 41:43.700
- I didn't start sh--.

41:43.735 --> 41:45.851
- You stated some bullsh--.
- That was ----ing low budget.

41:45.871 --> 41:47.036
- And you need to
watch your mouth.

41:47.072 --> 41:47.887
- It was low budget.

41:47.923 --> 41:50.022
- Watch-- your
mother's low budget.

41:50.041 --> 41:51.407
Go cry about it in your room.
- You gotta stop saying that.

41:51.459 --> 41:52.325
Okay.
- Candiace.

41:52.360 --> 41:54.077
- No, no, no, no, no!

41:54.129 --> 41:55.562
- I'm not gonna get into it,
but, candiace, you--

41:55.597 --> 41:57.630
- no! No! No!

41:57.666 --> 41:59.365
- You don't know her mom.
Relax.

41:59.384 --> 42:01.201
- Then don't speak ill.
- (bleep) you.

42:01.236 --> 42:02.869
- (bleep) you, mia!
- (bleep) you!

42:02.904 --> 42:04.103
- You don't
know her story.

42:04.139 --> 42:05.772
- And you don't know
her story, either!

42:05.807 --> 42:07.006
- I do, I've spent
more time with her.

42:07.041 --> 42:07.941
- Goodbye!

42:07.976 --> 42:10.510
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

42:11.980 --> 42:14.013

"the real housewives
of potomac"...

42:14.048 --> 42:15.548
- Oh, wait, I saw some food.
- Oh, they're throwing sh--.

42:15.584 --> 42:17.584
- I don't care!
- My mother is a recovering--

42:17.619 --> 42:18.551
- watch yourself!

42:18.587 --> 42:20.403
- If my mom relapses
because of that bitch,

42:20.438 --> 42:22.188
she better catch
my ass outside.

42:23.992 --> 42:25.575
- Why you look
so good, girl?

42:25.610 --> 42:28.361
[laughing]

42:28.396 --> 42:29.929
- oh, lord, okay.

42:34.869 --> 42:37.537

42:37.572 --> 42:40.240

to forgiveness.

about michael ever in life.

42:44.296 --> 42:45.261
my husband so wrong.
