09:15.163 --> 09:16.164
Take that back.

09:16.207 --> 09:18.209
Take it back to
the blue truck.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.646
Check out the damage
on the fender.

09:19.689 --> 09:21.256
That's the same make and model,

09:21.299 --> 09:23.345
just a different color
with an added bed cover.

09:23.388 --> 09:25.260
You're saying they swapped out
the color somehow?

09:25.303 --> 09:26.827
Well, either that or we
got to put out a warrant

09:26.870 --> 09:28.045
for Penn and Teller.

09:28.089 --> 09:29.046
That's a pretty elaborate plan
just to steal

09:29.090 --> 09:30.047
some construction
equipment.

09:30.091 --> 09:31.222
It wasn't just any equipment.

09:31.266 --> 09:32.310
We got something.

09:32.354 --> 09:34.312
Leon Bournes
is a trained expert

09:34.356 --> 09:36.619
with the type of welding
equipment that was stolen.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.273
Nice to meet you.

09:38.316 --> 09:39.535
What can you tell us?

09:39.579 --> 09:40.754
Everything there is.

09:40.797 --> 09:42.582
Called a thermal lance.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.758
Industrial grade
cutting tool.

09:44.801 --> 09:46.063
Can cut
through anything:

09:46.107 --> 09:48.152
concrete, steel,
you name it.

09:48.196 --> 09:49.893
Can they use it
as a weapon?Could,

09:49.937 --> 09:50.894
but I couldn't imagine
why you'd want to.

09:50.938 --> 09:51.895
Why the hell
would someone

09:51.939 --> 09:53.244
want to steal it?Profit.

09:53.288 --> 09:54.332
This thing costs
a pretty penny.

09:54.376 --> 09:55.638
Nah, nah.
It's more than that.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.074
This crew is professional.

09:57.118 --> 09:58.380
They're gonna use it
to access something

09:58.423 --> 10:00.556
more valuable that can't be got
some other way.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.905
Get a BOLO out
on that blue truck.

10:01.949 --> 10:03.472
Have police units check
back at the crash scene,

10:03.515 --> 10:04.734
search every inch.

10:04.778 --> 10:06.301
That truck caused
the accident.

10:06.344 --> 10:08.477
They must've left
evidence behind.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.610
Thanks, Leon.

10:12.220 --> 10:14.135
ROCKER:
Wally.

10:14.178 --> 10:15.919
What's up, man?

10:15.963 --> 10:17.921
Hey, Rocker.
Man, how you doing?[chuckles]: Hey.

10:17.965 --> 10:19.531
Good. You?I'm good.

10:19.575 --> 10:21.359
Nice.So what have
you been up to,

10:21.403 --> 10:23.231
besides wrecking
the shocks on Black Betty?

10:23.274 --> 10:25.276
[chuckles]Not that I minded. Meant
a lot of overtime for me,

10:25.320 --> 10:26.277
fixing your mistakes.

10:26.321 --> 10:27.714
You didn't hear?

10:27.757 --> 10:29.672
I got my own team
now. 50 Squad.

10:29.716 --> 10:32.675
Nice.Yeah. That means someone else
is doing the driving now.

10:32.719 --> 10:35.330
And I'm sure the current
SWAT mechanic is grateful.

10:35.373 --> 10:37.637
[laughs] Doesn't mean
we haven't missed you

10:37.680 --> 10:39.595
here at SWAT.Thanks.
You working something?

10:39.639 --> 10:42.206
Was on standby.
Got called in.What's the emergency?

10:42.250 --> 10:43.381
A crew stole some
construction equipment,

10:43.425 --> 10:45.557
shot a security guard
in the process.

10:45.601 --> 10:47.385
Geez. Any leads?

10:47.429 --> 10:49.344
Well, so far, sounds like
they covered their tracks.

10:49.387 --> 10:50.780
It's good to see you.
What are you doing here?

10:50.824 --> 10:52.347
Well, I'm actually,
uh, looking for Luca.

10:52.390 --> 10:53.696
Oh, he's on medical leave.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.393
He injured himself
over the summer

10:55.437 --> 10:57.047
in a fall, reaggravated
it last week.

10:57.091 --> 10:58.919
Wow, I'm sorry to hear that.

10:58.962 --> 11:01.791
Uh, what do you need him for?Well, you remember
my '69 GTO?

11:01.835 --> 11:03.750
Sure. It's a beauty.Well, I'm thinking
of selling it,

11:03.793 --> 11:05.969
and I thought maybe Luca
could help me find a buyer.

11:06.013 --> 11:08.015
You love that car. Why sell?Well,

11:08.058 --> 11:10.060
since starting
my own garage, I just...

11:10.104 --> 11:11.714
don't have time to drive it.
It just collects dust.

11:11.758 --> 11:15.370
Just the idea of selling to some
punk millennial just kills me.

11:15.413 --> 11:17.633
Mm.Maybe you could put
the word out to the boys here,

11:17.677 --> 11:19.069
help me find a buyer
that cares about it

11:19.113 --> 11:20.462
as much as you and me?For sure.

11:20.505 --> 11:22.333
We'll find someone worthy.Thanks, brother.

11:22.377 --> 11:23.726
I appreciate you.All right, buddy.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.510
You be safe.You, too.

11:25.554 --> 11:28.731
Come by more often.
We all miss you.[sighs]

11:28.775 --> 11:31.125
Unis found this
at the accident site.

11:31.168 --> 11:33.083
Magnetic sheeting
fit for a truck.

11:33.127 --> 11:35.172
So they just peel it away,
and the truck turns blue.

11:35.216 --> 11:37.566
We found four companies who
sell this particular brand.

11:37.609 --> 11:39.655
Two in the South Bay, one
in Hollywood, one in the Valley.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.918
Shouldn't take long
to vet each one.Already have.

11:41.962 --> 11:43.441
DEACON:
Kendrick Moore.

11:43.485 --> 11:45.356
Owner of Tinseltown Tuning
and Wraps in Panorama City.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.531
HICKS:
This guy's got a history

11:46.575 --> 11:48.316
of B and Es, armed robbery.

11:48.359 --> 11:50.318
Still got two years
left on his parole.

11:50.361 --> 11:51.754
Could be one
of today's crew.

11:51.798 --> 11:53.451
Our thoughts exactly.HICKS:
All right.

11:53.495 --> 11:55.410
Bring him in.

12:00.502 --> 12:03.461
So, she was in the
middle of the road.Right.

12:03.505 --> 12:05.072
She looks at me and asks,

12:05.115 --> 12:06.508
"Do you know the best
way to the hospital?"

12:06.551 --> 12:09.032
I said, "Yeah, just stand
right there, lady."

12:09.076 --> 12:10.381
[Deacon and Hondo laugh]

12:10.425 --> 12:12.514
Hey. I got work
you're keeping me from.

12:12.557 --> 12:13.776
Kendrick!

12:13.820 --> 12:16.213
Big man. Hey, you got
to do me a solid.

12:16.257 --> 12:18.694
I need you to help squash a bet
I got going with my partner.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.217
See, my money says
that you're gonna ask

12:20.261 --> 12:22.480
for a lawyer, and you ain't
gonna tell us a damn thing.

12:22.524 --> 12:24.482
And I'm betting that since
you got a legit business now,

12:24.526 --> 12:25.875
you're gonna see the light.

12:25.919 --> 12:27.355
You're gonna be
helpful right away.HONDO: Ah.

12:27.398 --> 12:29.357
Come on, don't keep us
in suspense, homeboy.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.054
Which one of us is
getting that $50?

12:35.276 --> 12:36.799
What are you even talking about?

12:36.843 --> 12:38.235
HONDO:
Oh, he doesn't know.

12:38.279 --> 12:40.498
You don't know.

12:40.542 --> 12:43.501
A crew shot a security guard
during a robbery today.

12:43.545 --> 12:45.982
Yeah, they used
custom truck wrapping to escape.

12:46.026 --> 12:49.029
Purchased from your shop.

12:50.291 --> 12:52.075
I don't know, Deac.

12:52.119 --> 12:53.468
You getting that
$50 or am I?

12:53.511 --> 12:54.774
Now, hold on.
Maybe he didn't know

12:54.817 --> 12:56.253
what this crew was up to
when he sold it to them.

12:58.386 --> 13:00.040
Whatever you're looking for,

13:00.083 --> 13:01.824
I don't know nothing.Ha! Boom!

13:01.868 --> 13:04.261
Nothing. I told you.
Give me my money.

13:04.305 --> 13:06.524
Damn. Accessory
to attempted murder.

13:06.568 --> 13:07.743
You know, I thought
at least he'd pretend

13:07.787 --> 13:10.224
not to know what
these guys were up to.

13:10.267 --> 13:12.574
At least then you'd
have a chance.

13:14.619 --> 13:17.535
Well, that is
kind of what happened.

13:22.236 --> 13:23.585
We know what
their target is?No.

13:23.628 --> 13:25.413
But Hondo's still working
on Kendrick.

13:25.456 --> 13:26.936
He claims to only know
the buyer's name.

13:26.980 --> 13:29.025
Chester Longwood. Now, Longwood

13:29.069 --> 13:30.113
paid Kendrick earlier this week

13:30.157 --> 13:31.419
for a rush job
on the truck wrap.

13:31.462 --> 13:32.724
Last known associates?

13:32.768 --> 13:34.596
Yeah. These guys.
Seth and Cyrus, they been

13:34.639 --> 13:36.598
in the system since they could
walk. Wasn't until their leader,

13:36.641 --> 13:38.382
Raines, took over
that this crew stepped up

13:38.426 --> 13:40.254
to hitting banks,
companies all over the country.

13:40.297 --> 13:41.603
Yeah, and each time
ending violently,

13:41.646 --> 13:42.822
with multiple
casualties.

13:42.865 --> 13:44.040
Now they're armed
with a thermal lance.

13:44.084 --> 13:45.476
They're just waiting
for the next score.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.435
Contact RHD Bank Squad.
Have 'em circulate the flyers.

13:47.478 --> 13:49.176
Touch base with
Robbery Task Force.

13:49.219 --> 13:50.612
Maybe we can get a step
ahead of these guys.

13:50.655 --> 13:51.961
We can do you
one better.

13:52.005 --> 13:53.441
Kendrick said that the crew
ordered another wrap.

13:53.484 --> 13:55.399
Hondo's waiting
on the delivery right now.

13:55.443 --> 13:56.705
All right.

13:59.403 --> 14:00.927
Why don't you ask
Deacon what he thinks?

14:00.970 --> 14:02.493
What now?

14:02.537 --> 14:04.278
Okay, so I'm about to go out
on a third date with Molly...

14:04.321 --> 14:05.801
Wait a second.
Third date?

14:05.845 --> 14:08.021
I thought you said last week
wasn't even a first date.

14:08.064 --> 14:09.326
Well, apparently,
it was.

14:09.370 --> 14:10.762
And then we went on another,

14:10.806 --> 14:12.895
and I'm taking her out again
tonight for dinner. What?

14:12.939 --> 14:15.115
Yeah, Luca's been joking
about Street being dumb enough

14:15.158 --> 14:17.160
to date the boss's daughter.
Now he's actually doing it.

14:17.204 --> 14:18.901
Told him he better not
let Hicks find out.

14:18.945 --> 14:20.598
I'm thinking
I should just tell him.

14:20.642 --> 14:22.513
Well, that's an interesting
form of career sabotage.

14:22.557 --> 14:25.516
Last year, I almost lost this
job because of keeping secrets.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.518
Now I want to be honest
and that's the wrong move, too?

14:27.562 --> 14:29.477
The relationship
is still new.

14:29.520 --> 14:30.913
What if it flames
out in a week?

14:30.957 --> 14:33.133
Why risk telling
Hicks? Right, Deac?

14:33.176 --> 14:34.917
I don't know.
It seems dicey either way.

14:34.961 --> 14:37.485
Look, there are, what,
eight million people

14:37.528 --> 14:38.747
in the Greater
Los Angeles area.

14:38.790 --> 14:40.444
At least half of
them are women.

14:40.488 --> 14:42.533
Why don't you just date
one of them?

14:42.577 --> 14:44.840
Yeah, but most of 'em
probably have taste.

14:45.841 --> 14:48.148
You guys are a big help.

14:59.637 --> 15:00.638
Everything good with you today?

15:00.682 --> 15:02.162
You're a little quieter
than normal.

15:02.205 --> 15:03.424
Just had a weird morning.

15:03.467 --> 15:05.556
Not gonna
talk about it.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.124
I know you and Annie don't
approve of my home life.

15:08.168 --> 15:09.299
Come on.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.301
You know that wasn't
a judgment of you.

15:11.345 --> 15:13.608
[sighs]Annie's issue

15:13.651 --> 15:16.176
was you talking to Lila about it
and in a way that made it hard

15:16.219 --> 15:17.917
for Annie to explain it
to her. That's all.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.614
I know. And to her credit,

15:19.657 --> 15:22.269
I'm still trying to
figure it all out.

15:22.312 --> 15:25.315
Yeah. Well...

15:25.359 --> 15:27.317
[exhales]

15:27.361 --> 15:29.319
I'm a pretty good
sounding board.

15:29.363 --> 15:31.452
You want to try me?

15:32.496 --> 15:34.324
Ty basically accused me

15:34.368 --> 15:36.457
of caring more for Kira
than I do for him,

15:36.500 --> 15:39.547
saying that I'm throwing
this relationship triangle

15:39.590 --> 15:40.896
out of balance.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.899
Is he right?

15:44.944 --> 15:47.120
Maybe.

15:47.163 --> 15:50.340
Kira and I,
it just works.

15:50.384 --> 15:52.734
With Ty, it's good, but...

15:52.777 --> 15:54.518
it's not the same.Have you talked

15:54.562 --> 15:55.737
to either of them
about any of this?

15:55.780 --> 15:57.434
How can I?
Th-They're getting married.

15:57.478 --> 16:00.263
I'm supposed to be there equally
for the both of 'em.

16:00.307 --> 16:02.309
You want my advice?

16:03.963 --> 16:05.965
Tell her how you feel.

16:06.008 --> 16:07.575
People, they go
into marriages thinking

16:07.618 --> 16:09.142
that it's gonna make
everything better.

16:09.185 --> 16:10.665
A-And in reality,

16:10.708 --> 16:12.275
all it does is shine a light

16:12.319 --> 16:14.147
on all the issues you had
before the wedding.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.888
Annie and I, before we got
married, we took this...

16:16.932 --> 16:18.890
marriage prep course
through the church.

16:18.934 --> 16:22.068
It's like a boot camp
for engaged couples.

16:22.111 --> 16:23.895
On the first day,

16:23.939 --> 16:26.202
we realized how much
we didn't know about each other

16:26.246 --> 16:28.335
because there were things
that we didn't think to share.

16:32.208 --> 16:36.299
You want to make
this relationship work...

16:36.343 --> 16:37.692
make it work.

16:41.130 --> 16:42.392
Hey.

16:42.436 --> 16:43.915
Yeah?

16:43.959 --> 16:47.006
Thanks for not saying
"I told you so."

16:47.049 --> 16:49.008

This thing's got power!

[phone ringing]

17:07.722 --> 17:09.158
Yo.

17:09.202 --> 17:11.291
Hey, it's Kendrick
from Tinseltown Tuning.

17:11.334 --> 17:13.336
The wrap you ordered
came in a day early.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.164
I can get one of my guys
to drop it off now

17:15.208 --> 17:17.427
if you're available, but I'm-a
need someone to sign for it.

17:17.471 --> 17:19.125
Great.
I'll text you the address.

17:19.168 --> 17:21.431
We're only gonna be here
for the next two hours.

Can you make it by then?

17:22.998 --> 17:24.913
My guys'll be there in an hour.

17:24.956 --> 17:27.220
Perfect.

17:31.659 --> 17:32.921
Text just came through
with an address

17:32.964 --> 17:34.966
to a warehouse in Claremont
off the 10.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.318
Address matches to where
we traced the call.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.756
We got 'em.

17:46.587 --> 17:50.112
Wally. Long time no see.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.635
What's up?Well, I brought this photo.

17:51.679 --> 17:53.420
Thought it might help
with a prospective buyer,

17:53.463 --> 17:55.422
unless you've
found one already.

17:55.465 --> 17:57.076
Not yet.

17:57.119 --> 17:58.947
Sorry, been busy
on this case.

17:58.990 --> 18:00.514
Didn't know it was a rush.

18:00.557 --> 18:02.472
Well, do you-- do you got
somewhere I can pin this up?

18:02.516 --> 18:04.474
You know, with a lot of
foot traffic or something?

18:04.518 --> 18:06.259
Wally, man,
what's going on?

18:06.302 --> 18:08.130
Why the full-court press
to sell right now?

18:08.174 --> 18:11.002
Okay, I-I didn't want
to say, but, um...

18:11.046 --> 18:14.528
truth is, my-my auto
shop's not doing so hot

18:14.571 --> 18:16.356
and I need cash or I'm
gonna lose the business.

18:16.399 --> 18:18.097
Wow.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.663
Yeah.Look, I'll talk

18:19.707 --> 18:20.664
to Luca.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.057
And between the two of us,

18:22.101 --> 18:23.841
I promise
we'll find you a buyer.

18:23.885 --> 18:25.626
Give us
a few days, okay?

18:25.669 --> 18:27.410
DEACON:
Rocker, the warrant came
through. We're heading

18:27.454 --> 18:28.542
to a warehouse in Claremont.

18:28.585 --> 18:30.065
Watch our backs
from the situation room?

18:30.109 --> 18:31.066
Absolutely.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.721
[siren wailing]

18:38.682 --> 18:40.641
HONDO: 20-David to Command.
Initiating entry.

18:40.684 --> 18:42.686
Roger. Watch your six.

18:42.730 --> 18:44.210
Tan, move.

18:46.212 --> 18:48.039
TAN:
Three,

18:48.083 --> 18:50.129
two, one.

19:00.313 --> 19:02.141
Left side clear.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.185
Clear.

19:04.447 --> 19:05.579
No one's home.

19:05.622 --> 19:06.406
Where are they?They said
they'd be here

19:06.449 --> 19:08.451
for the next two hours.

19:08.495 --> 19:10.279
Just the door.

19:10.323 --> 19:12.107
Where's the rest of the vault?TAN: Check it out.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.891
Something was used to
cut right through it.

19:13.935 --> 19:15.154
That's the thermal lance.

19:15.197 --> 19:16.285
They must've been practicing
for the real job,

19:16.329 --> 19:17.678
whatever that is.Hey, boss.

19:17.721 --> 19:19.070
Still hot.

19:19.114 --> 19:20.289
They bailed before we got here.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.161
20-David to Command.
The warehouse is empty.

19:22.204 --> 19:23.292
Looks like they left in a hurry,

19:23.336 --> 19:25.599
almost like they knew
we were coming.

19:27.427 --> 19:30.343
ROCKER:
I trusted you.

19:30.386 --> 19:32.345
What are you mixed
up in, Wally?

19:32.388 --> 19:34.999
Why did you warn this crew that
they were about to be raided?

19:35.043 --> 19:37.176
I never wanted this.

19:37.219 --> 19:39.178
And I'm sorry I used you.

19:40.353 --> 19:41.832
They made me do it,

19:41.876 --> 19:43.617
told me
I'd be off the hook.

19:43.660 --> 19:45.096
For what?

19:45.140 --> 19:47.403
This guy, Raines.
[exhales]

19:47.447 --> 19:49.231
Mostly runs a bookie business,

19:49.275 --> 19:52.234
but word is he makes his
real money hiring heist crews

19:52.278 --> 19:53.235
to pull off jobs.

19:53.279 --> 19:54.758
And you're involved
with him?

19:54.802 --> 19:56.020
Why?

19:59.198 --> 20:02.766
I was doing real well
for a while, I swear.

20:02.810 --> 20:05.378
You know,
I had a girlfriend.

20:05.421 --> 20:07.206
Business was booming.

20:07.249 --> 20:11.427
I was a hot hand
at picking the ponies.

20:12.820 --> 20:15.866
Then I started losing.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.303
Bad.

20:18.695 --> 20:20.871
I thought I could get out
from under it.By betraying

20:20.915 --> 20:23.831
a friend instead of asking
for help from any of us?

20:23.874 --> 20:25.528
You don't know these people.

20:25.572 --> 20:27.008
When they found out
I worked at the police garage

20:27.051 --> 20:28.575
and still had friends at SWAT...

20:28.618 --> 20:30.229
DEACON:
You had other
options, Wally,

20:30.272 --> 20:32.100
besides spying on us.

20:39.934 --> 20:42.066
What do I got now?

20:43.111 --> 20:45.287
My business is gone.

20:45.331 --> 20:47.246
I'm gonna go
to jail forever.

20:47.289 --> 20:50.553
Hey. This crew
has already hurt people.

20:50.597 --> 20:52.686
And their next job could be
a bank, somewhere public,

20:52.729 --> 20:54.383
where innocent
civilians are at risk.

20:54.427 --> 20:56.255
You know how dangerous
these guys are.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.126
Okay, I didn't want anyone
to get hurt.

20:58.169 --> 20:59.127
ROCKER:
That's fine.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.433
But it doesn't help us.

21:00.476 --> 21:02.696
[exhales]

21:02.739 --> 21:04.306
Okay, it's not gonna be a bank.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.265
Bank's response time
is too quick for whatever

21:06.308 --> 21:08.005
they're using
the thermal lance for.Okay,

21:08.049 --> 21:09.877
so what's their next job
gonna be? Any detail helps.

21:09.920 --> 21:13.750
I heard 'em talking about some
kind of cash prize or something.

21:13.794 --> 21:15.317
Okay, that's all I know.

21:15.361 --> 21:17.145
I'm telling you the truth.

21:21.236 --> 21:22.759
[door opens]

21:26.372 --> 21:27.808
[door closes]

21:28.939 --> 21:30.332
NICHELLE:
Officer Hondo?

21:31.725 --> 21:33.901
[sighs]Hey. Um... Mich-- No.

21:33.944 --> 21:36.382
Uh, uh, Nichelle.
I get it right?

21:36.425 --> 21:37.339
You did.
Okay. Whew.

21:37.383 --> 21:39.036
How is the driver doing?

21:39.080 --> 21:40.211
He's gonna be just fine,

21:40.255 --> 21:41.778
in large part,
because of you.

21:41.822 --> 21:43.824
I can't thank you enough
for your help.

21:43.867 --> 21:45.216
Getting my van back

21:45.260 --> 21:47.480
would be a good way
to return the favor.

21:47.523 --> 21:49.351
Did you check with the
primary detective on the case?

21:49.395 --> 21:51.310
He said because
the truck hit me

21:51.353 --> 21:52.963
it's evidence and
needs to hold it,

21:53.007 --> 21:54.617
but I need my van.Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

21:54.661 --> 21:57.620
It's just, it's still
an ongoing case.

21:57.664 --> 21:59.796
Look, I helped you
with the victim,

21:59.840 --> 22:01.363
and I just now helped

22:01.407 --> 22:03.539
those detectives
identify the driver.

22:03.583 --> 22:04.845
The way I look at it,

22:04.888 --> 22:07.369
that's twice
the LAPD owes me.

22:07.413 --> 22:08.718
[chuckling]

22:08.762 --> 22:10.677
Okay, I can't really argue
with that.

22:10.720 --> 22:13.897
Look, no promises,
we could loan you a car.

22:13.941 --> 22:16.335
I don't need a car.
I need my van.

22:16.378 --> 22:19.338
I run a shuttle service
for kids from Dorsey.

22:19.381 --> 22:21.078
Dorsey?
I went to Crenshaw.

22:21.122 --> 22:23.385
I won't hold that
against you.
Okay.

22:23.429 --> 22:24.865
I take it that's
where you went.

22:24.908 --> 22:26.823
No, I went to Crestridge,
Baldwin Hills.

22:26.867 --> 22:28.999
That's a private school.
You're shuttling kids

22:29.043 --> 22:31.219
in my neighborhood?It's a long story.

22:31.262 --> 22:33.177
Look, I know that our standard
operating procedures around here

22:33.221 --> 22:35.441
are less than ideal, so I'll
try to speed things along.

22:35.484 --> 22:38.052
Do you have a card? I can reach
out if I make something happen.

22:38.095 --> 22:40.010
A card?
This the '90s?

22:40.054 --> 22:42.970
Just give me your phone.
I'll put my number in.

22:43.971 --> 22:45.886
I work at Gye Nyame.

22:45.929 --> 22:47.670
The book shop
in Leimert Park?Oh, it's not just

22:47.714 --> 22:49.890
a book shop anymore;
it's a community center.

22:49.933 --> 22:51.413
You obviously
haven't been.
No, I haven't.

22:51.457 --> 22:53.110
Not since it changed names.

22:53.154 --> 22:54.503
When did that happen?When I took over.

22:54.547 --> 22:56.157
"Gye Nyame" is
an Ashanti term.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.637
It means "except for God."

22:57.680 --> 22:59.290
It's a... a place of hope.

22:59.334 --> 23:01.641
You should stop by
sometime.

23:01.684 --> 23:05.122
Seriously, call me if you figure
out a way to get my van back.

23:05.166 --> 23:06.515
Please.

23:16.264 --> 23:18.222
[sighs] Hey.

23:18.266 --> 23:21.312
Hey.
Thanks for coming.

23:21.356 --> 23:23.358
I just didn't feel
like this could wait.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.316
Yeah, of course.
What's going on?

23:25.360 --> 23:28.581
Um... I know
I'm violating

23:28.624 --> 23:32.193
one of the "we" rules by
just coming to you, but...

23:32.236 --> 23:34.238
[sighs] I feel like I need
to really talk to you

23:34.282 --> 23:36.327
about what Ty said
to me this morning.

23:36.371 --> 23:38.721
Okay.
What did he say?

23:38.765 --> 23:41.158
He said that I'm more
into you than him,

23:41.202 --> 23:45.467
and that I'm jeopardizing
everything we have.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.730
I was mad at first.

23:47.774 --> 23:51.821
And then I realized...

23:51.865 --> 23:54.258
[sighs] he's right.

23:56.260 --> 23:58.219
Chris...
Wait.

23:58.262 --> 24:00.526
I got into this relationship
because of you.

24:00.569 --> 24:04.312
And I know you love Ty,
so I've tried to.

24:04.355 --> 24:07.620
But... [sighs]

24:07.663 --> 24:09.491
I'm not in love with him.

24:11.406 --> 24:14.627
Not like I am with you.

24:14.670 --> 24:17.325
And I know the
timing's awful

24:17.368 --> 24:19.370
with you guys getting
married in a month.

24:20.981 --> 24:22.678
But...

24:22.722 --> 24:25.812
can you ever see
yourself with just me?

24:29.206 --> 24:31.165
Oh, my God, I completely
ruined things, didn't I?

24:31.208 --> 24:33.515
No. No, no, no, no.No, I did. I know. I did.

24:33.559 --> 24:34.690
Not at all. Chris,

24:34.734 --> 24:37.214
I'm in love with you, too.

24:40.304 --> 24:45.745
[exhales] I've been having
some doubts about the wedding.

24:45.788 --> 24:48.312
Maybe that's why.

24:48.356 --> 24:50.750
Maybe I felt this coming.

24:52.055 --> 24:55.189
I-I need some time
to think about this,
Yeah.

24:55.232 --> 24:59.367
and talk to Ty,
obviously.

24:59.410 --> 25:03.589
We-we-we can, we can talk
to him tonight, together.

25:03.632 --> 25:06.374
[takes deep breath]

25:11.858 --> 25:13.512
The vault door found
at the warehouse

25:13.555 --> 25:15.514
is off a Jefferson 590.

25:15.557 --> 25:18.429
Embassies, banks, armories
all around Los Angeles use it.

25:18.473 --> 25:20.257
It's one of the
strongest on the market.

25:20.301 --> 25:22.825
There's over 40 locations
in Los Angeles County alone.

25:22.869 --> 25:25.219
There's no way we have the
personnel to protect each one.

25:25.262 --> 25:27.482
No, we don't.DEACON:
It's not a bank.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.224
Wally said the crew mentioned
something about a cash prize.

25:30.267 --> 25:31.442
All right, that's
got to be it.

25:31.486 --> 25:32.922
The L.A. Speedway.

25:32.966 --> 25:35.142
They have a huge
cash prize race every year.

25:35.185 --> 25:36.622
I took my son to
it last year.

25:36.665 --> 25:38.145
A $4 million "Dash for Cash,"

25:38.188 --> 25:39.929

25:39.973 --> 25:41.235
There'll be thousands

watching, folks,

27:11.151 --> 27:12.543
Hey!

27:15.721 --> 27:17.592
How's the track?
It running slick?

27:17.636 --> 27:19.072
Do I know you?

27:19.115 --> 27:20.726
Nah, no, I got my rig
right over there.

27:20.769 --> 27:21.944
We're timing after you.

27:21.988 --> 27:23.946
Yeah, well, keep away
from Jimmy's car.

27:23.990 --> 27:25.600
He don't like
people too close.

27:25.644 --> 27:28.255
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure,
no problem. You got it.

27:38.395 --> 27:40.354
Hey, hey, hey.

27:40.397 --> 27:42.138
How'd you get down here?We were called.

27:42.182 --> 27:43.400
No, no, no,

you're the first one in line,

39:01.643 --> 39:04.167
because it isn't
until tomorrow.

39:04.211 --> 39:07.475
I just thought you might need
a shuttle van before that.

39:07.519 --> 39:09.651
What's this?Let me show you.

39:12.175 --> 39:14.439
Buddy of mine runs
a rental shop, owed me a favor.

39:14.482 --> 39:17.572
And since the
LAPD owes you...

39:17.616 --> 39:19.574
[both chuckle]

39:21.402 --> 39:24.666
It's all yours.

39:24.710 --> 39:26.625
Until you get your van back.

39:26.668 --> 39:28.844
[sighs]

39:28.888 --> 39:30.237
Thank you.

39:30.280 --> 39:32.761
This means a lot
to the kids I help.

39:32.805 --> 39:36.548
Is this standard operating
procedure, though,

39:36.591 --> 39:38.419
to come down here
on your off time?

39:38.463 --> 39:41.161
Got to say it's not my typical
interaction with the police.

39:41.204 --> 39:42.510
I was curious.

39:42.554 --> 39:44.469
I mean, it's not every day
you meet a private school

39:44.512 --> 39:45.992
Baldwin Hills girl
who does what you do.

39:46.035 --> 39:48.864
Meaning what? You think
I have an angle?

39:48.908 --> 39:50.475
No, no, not necessarily.

39:50.518 --> 39:52.259
I just-- I care a lot
about this neighborhood,

39:52.302 --> 39:53.956
and I like knowing
what goes on here.
Good.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.525
Because I love where
I'm from, up on the hill.

39:57.569 --> 39:59.527
But a lot of my
friends growing up

39:59.571 --> 40:01.442
lived at the bottom
of that hill.

40:01.486 --> 40:04.489
I've always wanted to feel
more a part of that,

40:04.532 --> 40:06.273
do more, give more.

40:06.316 --> 40:08.449
So, here I am.

40:08.493 --> 40:10.233
How about you?

40:10.277 --> 40:13.889
How does a guy from Crenshaw
become a SWAT sergeant?

40:13.933 --> 40:16.457
Okay, that right there
is a long story.

40:16.501 --> 40:18.198
Which I'd love to
tell you sometime.

40:18.241 --> 40:20.330
How are you getting home?

40:20.374 --> 40:23.421
I was kind of hoping
you might give me a ride.

40:23.464 --> 40:24.639
[both laugh]

40:24.683 --> 40:27.468
Oh, I see.
[clears throat]

40:27.512 --> 40:29.078
Well, that does sound nice,

40:29.122 --> 40:31.994
but, A, I don't get in
cars with strangers.

40:32.038 --> 40:33.692
And, B, I have
a rowdy group

40:33.735 --> 40:37.478
of teenagers arriving
in ten minutes, so...

40:37.522 --> 40:40.089
I can call you an Uber.No, it's-it's cool.

40:40.133 --> 40:41.743
I can get my own, thanks.

40:41.787 --> 40:43.136
But maybe we could
arrange something

40:43.179 --> 40:45.747
to try and cure this,
uh, strangers problem?

40:45.791 --> 40:47.053
Come by the
meeting tomorrow.

40:47.096 --> 40:48.446
Maybe we can talk then.

40:48.489 --> 40:49.751
I'll check my schedule.

40:49.795 --> 40:52.711
Okay, you do that.[chuckles]
