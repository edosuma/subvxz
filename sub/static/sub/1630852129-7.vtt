Whoever I do bring home,
what do you think about,

02:34.153 --> 02:35.738

02:35.822 --> 02:37.198
- It would be
an absolute honor

02:37.282 --> 02:39.075
if I was chosen
to go meet your family,

02:39.158 --> 02:42.078
because, you know,
family is everything to me.

02:42.161 --> 02:44.914
So I would take that
as you committing to me.

02:44.998 --> 02:48.543
And you already know that
my feelings for you are real.

02:48.626 --> 02:51.754
I definitely would be
committed to you.

02:51.838 --> 02:55.091
I think I have shown that
and expressed it to you.

<i>Brooke and I</i>

Will it hurt if I'm not chosen?
Absolutely.

03:03.182 --> 03:05.351
Have I expressed that to him?
Absolutely.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.270
<i>You know, I'm not</i>
<i>expressing my heart</i>

03:07.353 --> 03:09.272

03:09.355 --> 03:12.233
So it'd be, you know,
really amazing.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.068
- I'd like to piggyback
off of that.

03:14.152 --> 03:17.989
I'm excited about meeting an
even bigger family than mine,

03:18.072 --> 03:20.199
'cause I'm used
to the big Italian families,

03:20.283 --> 03:21.826

<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

25:07.505 --> 25:09.090
<i>- [sighs]</i>

25:13.970 --> 25:17.766
<i>[emotional music]</i>

25:17.849 --> 25:19.976
<i>- Hi.</i>
<i>- Hi, gorgeous.</i>

25:21.144 --> 25:22.354
- Mm.

25:22.437 --> 25:24.606
- I am feeling the stress
and the weight

25:24.689 --> 25:28.235
of a big decision
coming up tonight,

25:28.318 --> 25:30.320
and I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

25:30.403 --> 25:32.405
<i>So for me, it's really</i>
<i>important to talk to Brooke,</i>

25:32.489 --> 25:34.282
because for me to consider her,

25:34.366 --> 25:36.952
<i>I need to hear that she does</i>
<i>want a relationship with me</i>

25:37.035 --> 25:39.955
and that she wants to come home
to meet my family.

25:40.038 --> 25:42.791
Yesterday was, like,
a really hard day.

25:42.874 --> 25:44.417
- It was a momentary setback,

25:44.501 --> 25:46.461
but I woke up
with a lot of clarity,

25:46.544 --> 25:50.590
which kind of sent me
into the shower this morning

25:50.674 --> 25:52.634
with butterflies and excitement

25:52.717 --> 25:55.011
at the possibility
of going home with you,

25:55.095 --> 25:57.806
which was so relieving,

25:57.889 --> 26:01.142
because I think that fear
and that uncertainties

26:01.226 --> 26:03.144
were definitely
holding me back.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.981
This whole process
has peeled back layers for me

26:06.064 --> 26:08.733
that I was unaware I even had,

26:08.817 --> 26:11.653
and I think self-sabotage
is one of those layers

26:11.736 --> 26:13.697
that has been uncovered.

26:13.780 --> 26:16.658
And that has been
my defense mechanism

26:16.741 --> 26:19.828
is trying to push Nicci
closer to you.

26:19.911 --> 26:21.246
- Okay.

26:21.329 --> 26:23.373
- And I'm not giving you and me
a fair chance

26:23.456 --> 26:24.749
if I hide my feelings.

26:24.833 --> 26:27.168
I feel confident
in a future with you,

26:27.252 --> 26:29.879
and I'm 100% certain

26:29.963 --> 26:31.381
that I do want
to go home with you,

26:31.464 --> 26:33.842
but I'm still
at the point where

26:33.925 --> 26:38.013
I want to meet your family
as another date, you know?

26:38.096 --> 26:40.849
I know you're patient with me,
and that's what I need

26:40.932 --> 26:42.976
for us to progress
and that we can take this slow,

26:43.059 --> 26:45.645
because I haven't had
as much time with you.

26:45.729 --> 26:48.606
<i>- I'm just happy Brooke</i>
<i>has come around</i>

26:48.690 --> 26:51.026
and wants to pursue
a substantial relationship.

26:51.109 --> 26:54.195
<i>And now I'm sensing that</i>
<i>Brooke just needs some time,</i>

26:54.279 --> 26:57.866
which I think normally
is the best thing to do.

26:57.949 --> 27:01.161
It's just that now's our last
chance to really be together,

27:01.244 --> 27:03.955
so, you know,
I don't know what to do.

27:04.039 --> 27:08.251
<i>I want to feel certain</i>
<i>about my decision,</i>

27:08.335 --> 27:10.920
<i>and right now,</i>
<i>I have no idea.</i>

27:11.004 --> 27:12.464
Thank you for expressing
that to me.

27:12.547 --> 27:13.882
I definitely needed to hear it.

27:14.883 --> 27:17.385
- I don't want to leave this
with regrets, you know?

27:17.469 --> 27:19.721
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah.

27:19.804 --> 27:22.891
I think I just needed
a good night's sleep

27:22.974 --> 27:25.060
to not feel that fear anymore.

27:25.143 --> 27:29.147
<i>My feelings for Danny</i>
<i>grow stronger by the moment,</i>

27:29.230 --> 27:32.734
<i>and I know how much</i>
<i>family means to him.</i>

27:32.817 --> 27:35.445
<i>That would be a huge step</i>
<i>in our relationship</i>

27:35.528 --> 27:37.238
if I got to go meet his family.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.866
- I think you're just
one of the most genuine,

27:39.949 --> 27:43.495
like, mature,
beautiful people...

27:43.578 --> 27:44.913
- Thank you.
- I've ever met.

27:44.996 --> 27:46.915
- Thank you.
You're not too bad yourself.

27:46.998 --> 27:48.708
- And that's why
I'm so drawn to you.

27:52.587 --> 27:55.256
- Do you like country?
- I do.

27:55.340 --> 27:57.926
I just--I won't turn it on.
- Me too.

27:58.009 --> 28:00.053
- You'll never catch me being
like, "You know what we need?"

28:00.136 --> 28:01.471
Except for, like,
if I was, like,

28:01.554 --> 28:03.264
having a day in the country...
- Yeah.

28:03.348 --> 28:04.974
- Driving with
the windows down,

28:05.058 --> 28:06.976
but I would probably put on
Fleetwood Mac over country.

28:07.060 --> 28:09.771
- Fleetwood Mac
is my favorite band!

28:09.854 --> 28:11.481
Can I give you a hug?

28:11.564 --> 28:14.651
- I've been like, "Wah!"
- [laughs]

28:14.734 --> 28:16.945
Okay, cool.
We're, like, the same.

28:17.028 --> 28:18.321
- Yeah.

28:18.405 --> 28:20.907
I still want to talk
to Hina after our date

28:20.990 --> 28:22.992
because at this point,
I'm not sure

28:23.076 --> 28:25.286
where their head is at
in terms of

28:25.370 --> 28:26.955
coming home with me
for Christmas.

28:27.038 --> 28:29.040
Well, I do have a letter
I would like to read to you.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.542
- Okay.
- 'Cause I feel like

28:30.625 --> 28:32.752
it just tells you everything.

28:32.836 --> 28:36.464
I hope that this letter
will show Hina how I truly feel

28:36.548 --> 28:40.385
and that I'm trying
to be more open.

28:41.428 --> 28:45.557
Hina, when I first saw you,
my first thought was,

28:45.640 --> 28:48.726
"Who is this beautiful,
mysterious person?"

28:48.810 --> 28:51.020
The more I learn about you,
I find myself

28:51.104 --> 28:54.858
attracted to your soul,
your mind, and your heart.

28:54.941 --> 28:57.652
I admire the way
you care for others.

28:57.735 --> 29:00.697
To be honest,
I did more time admiring you

29:00.780 --> 29:04.659
than I did vocalizing
my admiration.

29:04.742 --> 29:06.995
I did know the depths
of what I was feeling,

29:07.078 --> 29:09.247
but I didn't want to act
until I knew for sure,

29:09.330 --> 29:12.250
in attempts to protect
both you and I.

29:12.333 --> 29:16.045
I do feel you pulling away,
and our energy is different.

29:16.129 --> 29:18.548
I realize that if I don't
put myself out there,

29:18.631 --> 29:21.676
I may lose someone
really special.

29:21.759 --> 29:23.845
So here's what I do know.

29:23.928 --> 29:25.847
I like you. A lot.

29:25.930 --> 29:28.349
I want to see if this
is something that can be more,

29:28.433 --> 29:31.728
and I don't pursue anything
unless my heart is fully in it.

29:31.811 --> 29:34.522
- Thank you.
That was really thoughtful.

29:35.273 --> 29:38.526
You're not wrong
in that I pulled away.

29:38.610 --> 29:42.238
The pull-away started
the overnight situation.

29:42.322 --> 29:44.449
I was, like, so, so

29:44.532 --> 29:47.202
112% in it with you.

29:47.285 --> 29:50.872
<i>I understand that Amanda's</i>
<i>feelings for me are genuine.</i>

29:50.955 --> 29:52.207
It was the carelessness

29:52.290 --> 29:54.042
throughout the entire process
for me

29:54.125 --> 29:56.878
and her choosing to take
Brianna on the overnight date.

29:56.961 --> 29:59.797
I was trying so hard
to show you, like, "Look. Look.

29:59.881 --> 30:01.341
Look at me.
Look at me,"

30:01.424 --> 30:06.221
and then that felt like
such a profound rejection

30:06.304 --> 30:10.266
that I immediately,
like, coiled.

30:10.350 --> 30:13.770
You hurt me,
so now I'm shut down.

30:13.853 --> 30:16.356
<i>For me, meeting someone's</i>
<i>family is a huge deal.</i>

30:16.439 --> 30:19.108
I'm not sure if I'm ready
to meet Amanda's parents.

30:19.192 --> 30:21.903
I realize that I'm not
where I was before,

30:21.986 --> 30:23.947
and I want to be there.

30:24.030 --> 30:27.075
But, like, I don't know
how I feel anymore.

30:28.201 --> 30:30.078
<i>- I care about Hina a lot.</i>

30:30.161 --> 30:32.372
<i>I support who they are</i>
<i>and the way they're feeling,</i>

30:32.455 --> 30:34.749
but at the same time,
in this moment,

30:34.832 --> 30:36.834
I'm confident of how I feel.

30:36.918 --> 30:39.796
<i>And I want to fight for us.</i>

30:39.879 --> 30:43.591
I feel like the connection
that Hina and I have is real.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.260
<i>narrator:</i>
<i>Okay, now it's time</i>

30:45.343 --> 30:46.970
<i>for your clusterfuck recap.</i>

30:47.053 --> 30:49.264
<i>So Remi is fully in love</i>
<i>with Amanda,</i>

30:49.347 --> 30:51.849
<i>and Amanda is totally into it.</i>

30:51.933 --> 30:54.352
<i>But now that Hina's</i>

30:54.435 --> 30:56.604

<i>at these hotties?</i>

31:07.865 --> 31:09.701
<i>They're about to make</i>
<i>the biggest decision</i>

31:09.784 --> 31:11.452
<i>of their lives.</i>

31:11.536 --> 31:14.122
<i>Maybe I shouldn't</i>
<i>have taken that edible.</i>

31:14.205 --> 31:15.707
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>Let me just take one more</i>

31:15.790 --> 31:16.958
<i>to balance it out.</i>

31:17.792 --> 31:19.377
- Last one.
- Last one.

31:19.460 --> 31:20.628
- Oh, man.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.130
- What's on your mind, Amanda?

31:22.213 --> 31:25.133
- It's been
a very emotional journey,

31:25.216 --> 31:28.511
and I feel like it all
came to a head today,

31:28.595 --> 31:29.846
and just--

31:29.929 --> 31:31.931
it was just--
it was a lot, I feel like.

31:32.015 --> 31:35.602
With Remi,
I admire so much about her.

31:35.685 --> 31:38.271
I think that she's
an amazing person,

31:38.354 --> 31:42.984
and I do feel that Remi
legitimately likes me a lot.

31:43.067 --> 31:45.778
But I'm not sure
if I feel the same way.

31:45.862 --> 31:48.823
But I'm also in this position
now where I'm like,

31:48.906 --> 31:51.159
"Maybe this is the person
I should be choosing,"

31:51.242 --> 31:54.245
because they're sitting here
telling me all these things

31:54.329 --> 31:56.414
that I would want
to hear from someone,

31:56.497 --> 32:00.376
especially after talking
with Hina today.

32:00.460 --> 32:01.669
- How do you feel about Hina?

32:01.753 --> 32:03.004
- Well,
I wrote a letter to Hina,

32:03.087 --> 32:04.255
because I feel like I needed

32:04.339 --> 32:06.341
to get my feelings out
on paper.

32:06.424 --> 32:09.677
And I found out today that they
were having second thoughts

32:09.761 --> 32:12.180
at a time that I thought
they were really into me

32:12.263 --> 32:13.598
and I thought we were good.

32:13.681 --> 32:15.350
- Trust your gut
and your intuition.

32:15.433 --> 32:17.852
- Yeah.
- I feel like Martin reminds me

32:17.935 --> 32:19.354
of a lot about you and Remi.

32:19.437 --> 32:21.272
Martin's great.
We have a connection.

32:21.356 --> 32:23.608
He is a good-looking guy,
and I know he likes me.

32:23.691 --> 32:25.568
And I think
if I choose Martin,

32:25.652 --> 32:28.905
I think maybe there's potential
to grow to like him.

32:28.988 --> 32:30.490
<i>But then there's Winston.</i>

32:30.573 --> 32:33.826
He's not the kind of guy
I would ever date,

32:33.910 --> 32:35.745
but, like,
there is chemistry.

32:35.828 --> 32:37.664
<i>He makes me laugh,</i>
<i>and his personality is,</i>

32:37.747 --> 32:39.540
<i>like, kind of, like,</i>
<i>on par with mine.</i>

32:39.624 --> 32:41.751
So I think, for me,
it comes down to,

32:41.834 --> 32:43.044
am I gonna choose potential

32:43.127 --> 32:45.213
or if I'm gonna
choose chemistry.

32:45.296 --> 32:47.674
- It's all about balancing
the risk versus reward

32:47.757 --> 32:49.300
in my choice tonight.

32:49.384 --> 32:51.719
I have feelings
for Brooke and for Nicci,

32:51.803 --> 32:53.179
sort of in different ways.

32:53.262 --> 32:54.806
<i>Nicci wants a relationship,</i>

32:54.889 --> 32:56.933
she's expressed to me
a lot of times.

32:57.016 --> 32:59.727
And then with Brooke,
it's like, the next date,

32:59.811 --> 33:00.895
the next
getting to know each other

33:00.978 --> 33:02.397
in a different environment.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.731
But there's something
about Brooke, like--

33:03.815 --> 33:06.025
I just, like--
just her smile.

33:06.109 --> 33:07.485
It just hits me,
like, right here.

33:07.568 --> 33:09.946
But I know Nicci,
like, really cares for me,

33:10.029 --> 33:12.490
and she's been there,
and those feelings are proven.

33:12.573 --> 33:17.286
But she seems to me, like,
less emotionally mature,

33:17.370 --> 33:19.080
whereas Brooke
is more independent.

33:19.163 --> 33:20.665
- Yeah. There's something
about Brooke

33:20.748 --> 33:23.126
that just seems so authentic.
- Uh-huh.

33:23.209 --> 33:24.711
- And I'll be real honest
with you, buddy.

33:24.794 --> 33:26.212
Like, I do like Nicci,

33:26.295 --> 33:28.089
but there have been times
throughout this journey

33:28.172 --> 33:30.341
I have questioned her motives.

33:30.425 --> 33:32.885
Questioned her, to be honest.
- Mm-hmm.

33:32.969 --> 33:35.054
- Questioned, like,
"Is the dramatics a front?

33:35.138 --> 33:36.806
Is this really how you feel?"

33:36.889 --> 33:38.599
- You know, and that's a really
interesting point to bring up,

33:38.683 --> 33:40.393
'cause I felt that
with Nicci too.

33:40.476 --> 33:42.186
And I felt that
as I've gotten to know her,

33:42.270 --> 33:45.189
I've believed more, because
she is an emotional person,

33:45.273 --> 33:46.524
and she wears her heart
on her sleeve.

33:46.607 --> 33:49.235
- Totally.
- Yeah.

33:49.318 --> 33:52.280
- What does your
honest-to-God gut say?

33:52.363 --> 33:54.699
<i>- ♪ Would you rather ♪</i>

33:54.782 --> 33:57.201

I want to be the one
