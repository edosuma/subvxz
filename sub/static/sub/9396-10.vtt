00:03.870 --> 00:05.633
Hey, Mouth, have you seen Brooke?

00:05.705 --> 00:09.266
Yeah, she's benefiting with Felix.

00:10.377 --> 00:13.778
If my mom ever asks,
I got the test and I'm fine.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.144
If that's what you want.

00:15.215 --> 00:18.412
Yesterday,
Dan told me that you slept with Keith.

00:18.485 --> 00:21.147
-Is that true?
-No, of course not.

00:21.254 --> 00:24.655
I spent the whole night waiting for you,
all while you were with Chris.

00:24.724 --> 00:28.160
-Can we leave him out of this, please?
-Why? Are you into him?

00:28.228 --> 00:30.753
Just because people say something,
doesn't make it true, Felix.

00:31.164 --> 00:32.927
-Those were rumors.
-Yeah?

00:33.033 --> 00:35.228
How do you think rumors get started?

00:35.301 --> 00:38.168
It's okay,
I already flushed it down the toilet.

00:38.671 --> 00:40.298
I've only done it that one time.

00:40.373 --> 00:41.601
You don't get to have me...

00:41.674 --> 00:44.541
not my body,
and sure as hell not my heart.

00:44.644 --> 00:46.236
We're done.

00:46.646 --> 00:49.046
-We should do this more often.
-Do what?

00:50.016 --> 00:51.381
Be friends.

<i>Nathaniel Hawthorne once wrote.:</i>

01:43.103 --> 01:45.799

01:46.973 --> 01:51.637

<i>''without finally getting bewildered</i>

02:24.711 --> 02:28.306
-Haley.
-Hey, I'm sorry to bother you so early.

02:30.450 --> 02:33.647
Nathan and I had a fight last night
and he didn't come home and--

02:33.720 --> 02:34.812
<i>I talked to him.</i>

02:34.888 --> 02:36.355
-He's okay.
<i>-Well...</i>

02:36.656 --> 02:38.886
-do you know where he is?
-No.

02:39.125 --> 02:40.217
<i>Okay.</i>

02:40.293 --> 02:43.694
The next time you talk to him
can you ask him to come home, please?

02:43.763 --> 02:45.094
Okay, I will.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.498
AII right, look. Don't worry yourself, okay.
I'm sure he's fine.

02:48.568 --> 02:50.468
-AII right?
-Okay, bye, Luke.

02:53.439 --> 02:55.464
Thanks for covering for me, man.

02:55.642 --> 02:58.941
You're welcome, but it sucked.
I don't lie to Haley.

02:59.746 --> 03:02.374
-You just did.
-Why don't you go home? Work it out.

03:02.448 --> 03:04.916
It didn't sound like Haley
was going to school anyway.

03:04.984 --> 03:07.145
Yeah, why would they
have the formal on a Sunday?

03:07.220 --> 03:10.587
I don't know, to keep students
from partying, getting wasted...

03:10.657 --> 03:13.888
-arguing with their wives.
-Yeah, well, it didn't work.

03:15.795 --> 03:17.854
How did it go with Anna, anyway?

03:17.964 --> 03:20.728
Let's just say we didn't exactly
end the night together.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.461
Who did you end up with?

03:26.406 --> 03:28.169
Only in Tree Hill.

03:28.975 --> 03:31.341
-You two realize you're related, right?
-Hi, Brooke.

03:31.411 --> 03:34.346
-Double ew, if Tutor Wife is here.
-She's not.

03:35.114 --> 03:36.513
What's up?

03:36.583 --> 03:38.847
My car is now out of commission.

03:38.918 --> 03:41.682
Thanks to my jealous,
spiteful stain of a neighbor.

03:41.754 --> 03:43.881
And I was sort of thinking that...

03:44.123 --> 03:46.591
you might want to
walk to school together.

03:47.126 --> 03:50.254
Unless, of course,
you're waiting for your boy toy here.

03:50.763 --> 03:53.288
Go ahead, I'll catch up with you guys later.

03:53.366 --> 03:56.767
AII right. Go home, Nate. Work it out.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.052
Angel of the morning.

04:15.355 --> 04:18.449
Okay, look,
I wasn't with Lucas, so just chill out.

04:22.161 --> 04:23.788
Where were you, Anna?

04:24.664 --> 04:27.633
-I stayed at Peyton's.
-That's great.

04:28.301 --> 04:30.861
-Mom and Dad will love that.
-Then don't tell them.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.838
Just let me know
when I need to start packing again.

04:46.352 --> 04:51.312
-New digs for your return, Danny?
-No, new digs for your return.

04:52.191 --> 04:54.921
You did a hell of a job
while I was away, Keith.

04:58.898 --> 05:00.365
What do you say?

05:03.903 --> 05:05.894
-Who do you think did it?
-Felix.

05:06.939 --> 05:09.567
We kind of stopped benefiting.

05:12.512 --> 05:13.809
I'm glad.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.610
I mean,
not about the windshield thing, but...

05:16.683 --> 05:19.811
-about the rest of it.
-Why? Because you don't like him?

05:20.286 --> 05:21.583
No.

05:22.422 --> 05:24.413
Because you're better than that.

05:28.361 --> 05:29.919
I miss this, you know...

05:31.230 --> 05:32.857
talking to you.

05:37.403 --> 05:39.303
What happened to you?

05:40.039 --> 05:41.666
I'm not talking to you.

05:42.608 --> 05:44.007
Okay.

05:44.777 --> 05:47.769
But if it makes you feel any better,
Brooke dumped me.

05:48.681 --> 05:52.139
You told her, didn't you?
About the dollhouse and Tric?

05:53.486 --> 05:55.681
I thought she should know the truth.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.585
Whatever. I deserved it.

05:59.125 --> 06:00.319
It's a rule of life, Mouth...

06:00.393 --> 06:03.328
whatever crap you pull
always catches up to you.

06:03.396 --> 06:06.695
-It's a part of the game.
-It's not a game, Felix.

06:07.533 --> 06:08.761
Come on, Mouth...

06:08.835 --> 06:11.963
it took her less than an hour to crush me
and hook up with Lucas.

06:12.038 --> 06:15.201
-Lucas wouldn't do that, he's with Anna.
-Really?

06:20.246 --> 06:22.180
It's okay to freak out, Mouth.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.843
I did, last night.

06:37.530 --> 06:38.827
Hi.

06:41.267 --> 06:42.427
I'm sorry.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.401
I was....

06:46.105 --> 06:48.471
I was wrong last night, and...

06:48.541 --> 06:51.669
I found your letter from the camp
and I want you to go.

06:51.744 --> 06:55.236
It's not about the camp, Haley.
It's about trust.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.650
I want you to stop working with Chris.

07:02.221 --> 07:06.180
-He's incredibly talented, Nathan.
-I want you to stop seeing him.

07:12.799 --> 07:14.391
I won't do that.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.310
Hey, did you hear about my window?

07:31.250 --> 07:33.480
Somebody bashed in
my car windshield last night.

07:33.553 --> 07:36.920
Do you believe that?
I mean, could things get any worse?

07:40.059 --> 07:41.890
You wanna ask me that again?

07:48.434 --> 07:51.232
-What's this?
-An estimate for my windshield.

07:54.507 --> 07:56.668
-You think I did it?
-I know you did.

07:56.742 --> 07:59.575
I didn't break your window, baby,
just your heart.

08:00.446 --> 08:01.811
Please.

08:05.384 --> 08:08.751
With men like that in the world,
it's a wonder we're not gay.

08:09.388 --> 08:11.686
You see how everybody's looking at me?

08:11.757 --> 08:14.453
-Nobody's taking this seriously.
-Really?

08:14.527 --> 08:17.257
Because half the girls in PE
wouldn't change in front of me.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.163
That's 'cause you look better
than they do naked.

08:22.101 --> 08:24.069
You have any idea who did it?

08:26.973 --> 08:28.998
If you ask me, they did you a favor.

08:29.075 --> 08:31.202
Boys love lesbians.

08:32.979 --> 08:34.275
Come on.

08:35.581 --> 08:38.448
The old P. Sawyer
would have just rolled with this.

08:38.551 --> 08:41.679
I haven't been the old P. Sawyer
in a while, have I?

08:43.022 --> 08:45.422
Hey, your real friends are here for you.

08:59.438 --> 09:00.769
Unbelievable.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.070
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna get out of here.

09:03.142 --> 09:05.076
Do you want to come with me?

09:05.678 --> 09:06.975
Yeah...

09:07.046 --> 09:09.071
I have a quiz next period and if I miss it--

09:09.148 --> 09:13.209
-No, it's cool. I'll see you later.
-Okay.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.705
What's up? Looking for your wife?

09:41.814 --> 09:44.806
You're funny.
You're also done messing with Haley.

09:46.719 --> 09:49.745
-We're just rehearsing, man.
-No, you were rehearsing.

09:49.855 --> 09:51.720
-That's over now.
-Why?

09:52.425 --> 09:53.949
Can't you trust her?

09:54.760 --> 09:59.459
I mean, isn't that what this is about?
You love her, you married her...

10:00.333 --> 10:01.925
but can you trust her?

10:02.902 --> 10:06.394
Because if you can,
you got nothing to worry about, right?

10:08.541 --> 10:11.169
Come on, man.
I don't have a problem with you.

10:16.749 --> 10:19.479
See, you do have a problem with me.
A big problem.

10:19.552 --> 10:22.680
You can smile and act cool if you want to.
But the fact is, man...

10:22.755 --> 10:24.655
I used to destroy guys like you...

10:24.724 --> 10:26.123
daily.

10:26.759 --> 10:29.159
It'd be a shame
if something happened to this hand...

10:29.228 --> 10:31.025
and you couldn't play that guitar anymore.

10:31.097 --> 10:34.658
Just like it'd be a shame
if you were taking advantage of Haley.

10:40.206 --> 10:43.369
Don't cry, rock star.
You'll ruin your makeup.

10:48.648 --> 10:49.910
Pick up.

10:54.353 --> 10:57.720
<i>You've reached Sawyer Dredging.</i>
<i>lf you would like to leave a message...</i>

10:57.790 --> 10:59.985
<i>for Larry Sawyer,please do so after--</i>

11:05.398 --> 11:07.161
-Hey.
-Hey.

11:08.100 --> 11:11.331
So, I saw you cut out of lunch today.

11:13.806 --> 11:16.206
I just wanted to know how you're doing.

11:18.110 --> 11:19.407
Been better.

11:23.816 --> 11:25.579
Hey, come here.

11:32.258 --> 11:33.418
Sit down.

11:42.301 --> 11:44.826
So, do you know who wrote it
on your locker?

11:46.672 --> 11:48.071
No.

11:48.140 --> 11:51.735
I don't even want to know,
I just want it to all go away.

11:52.278 --> 11:53.802
Just, all of it.

12:02.588 --> 12:03.953
You miss Jake, huh?

12:06.792 --> 12:08.123
You should go.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.027
Peyton.

12:11.297 --> 12:15.461
Okay, you can't just walk in here
and ask me something like that.

12:15.534 --> 12:18.901
When is the last time we even had
a conversation about something real?

12:18.971 --> 12:20.632
I just thought you could use a friend.

12:20.706 --> 12:24.665
Yeah, I could use a friend, you know.
You don't qualify as that anymore, Lucas...

12:24.744 --> 12:28.703
because a real friend would know about
all the crap I've been dealing with lately.

12:28.781 --> 12:30.043
Like what?

12:32.618 --> 12:33.949
Just go, please.

12:36.222 --> 12:38.656
Okay, I'll go.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.155
Whatever you think...

12:47.500 --> 12:49.866
I really do care about you, Peyton.

13:03.682 --> 13:06.082
You sneaking away
without saying goodbye?

13:07.153 --> 13:08.620
Actually, I was....

13:10.022 --> 13:11.922
I was thinking about staying.

13:12.758 --> 13:15.818
Dan offered me a management position
at the dealership.

13:16.162 --> 13:18.062
Did you say no to Charleston?

13:18.697 --> 13:21.097
Not yet, but, I might.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.533
-You know I care about you, Keith.
-Yeah.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.167
Then listen to me.

13:29.241 --> 13:32.142
I know how much
teaching in Charleston means to you.

13:32.745 --> 13:35.145
I've seen you light up
when you talk about it.

13:35.214 --> 13:37.944
Not as much as I light up
when I talk about you.

13:39.885 --> 13:43.013
One of the reasons I fell for you
was your independence.

13:44.156 --> 13:46.681
You made your own way in the world.

13:46.759 --> 13:50.286
Your brother's business is his.
Charleston is yours.

13:51.797 --> 13:53.890
Don't let him take that from you.

14:06.612 --> 14:09.240
-Can I give you a piece of advice?
-Nice to see you, too.

14:09.315 --> 14:11.374
Next time you want to lie
about something...

14:11.450 --> 14:13.645
you might want to make sure
your mom is in on it.

14:13.719 --> 14:16.279
She told me
about Nathan sleeping here last night.

14:16.355 --> 14:17.583
Nathan just needed some time.

14:17.656 --> 14:19.920
And if you were here
I'd have done the same thing.

14:19.992 --> 14:22.552
-Lucas Eugene Scott!
-That sounds bad.

14:22.728 --> 14:24.059
''Eugene''?

14:27.700 --> 14:29.895
-Why would you lie to me?
-Yeah, get in line.

14:29.969 --> 14:33.029
-Mom, what are you talking about?
-Dan's heart condition.

14:33.105 --> 14:34.470
Is it genetic?

14:36.208 --> 14:38.301
-Yes.
-Why didn't you tell me?

14:38.477 --> 14:42.504
-What kind of doctor doesn't call me?
-Ma, I told him you were in Florence.

14:42.581 --> 14:46.039
Why? When there's a 50% chance
you have a genetic heart defect!

14:46.118 --> 14:48.109
-Nathan?
-No, he's fine.

14:48.187 --> 14:51.247
-He doesn't have it. He took the test.
-But you didn't?

14:52.024 --> 14:54.549
-Who told you?
-You are taking that test.

14:54.627 --> 14:57.790
-No, I'm not.
-Are you out of your mind?

14:58.063 --> 15:02.727
How can you be so reckless and cavalier
about a potentially fatal condition?

15:02.801 --> 15:03.893
I'm gonna go home.

15:03.969 --> 15:07.234
You're gonna give me the name
of the doctor that you've spoken with...

15:07.306 --> 15:10.173
and you're packing a bag,
because I'm driving you to that test.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.437
No, I'm not taking the test.
I don't want to know!

15:12.511 --> 15:14.604
-Why not?
-For lots of reasons.

15:14.680 --> 15:17.513
Basketball, the way I want to live my life.

15:17.583 --> 15:21.679
Lucas, basketball is a game.
Now, I am glad that you have a talent.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.746
But do you really think
that I will put a game before your life?

15:24.823 --> 15:26.586
-I would.
-Grow up!

15:26.659 --> 15:28.752
That tragic hero crap
only works in the movies.

15:28.827 --> 15:31.523
And you know what they don't show you
after they fade out?

15:31.597 --> 15:33.656
The hero's mother
putting her foot up his ass.

15:33.732 --> 15:37.293
Mom, you can threaten me all you want.
But you can't make me take that test.

15:37.369 --> 15:40.065
I sure as hell can. You think about that!

15:41.040 --> 15:44.407
Until you come to your senses,
your basketball days are over.

15:44.877 --> 15:45.866
Mom.

15:46.345 --> 15:49.746
You need parental permission to play,
and you just lost yours.

15:54.653 --> 15:56.450
-Okay, come on.
-Right.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.057
Hey, guys. What's up? Junk.

16:01.660 --> 16:03.890
How about a little two on two? Come on.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.659
Luke, I don't know much, man,
but I do know one thing.

16:06.732 --> 16:09.132
You damn sure ain't touching
no ball around here.

16:09.201 --> 16:11.601
-What's going on?
-Your mom told us about your heart.

16:11.670 --> 16:15.538
She said you'd be in danger if you played.
We'll be in danger if we let you play.

16:15.607 --> 16:18.167
-She was scary, Luke.
-Guys, I'm fine.

16:18.243 --> 16:21.804
That might be true.
We'll let your mom tell us that for sure.

16:22.581 --> 16:23.946
Let's go, man.

16:44.937 --> 16:48.805
-What's going on with you?
-I heard about your heart test.

16:50.542 --> 16:53.067
-I'm fine.
-Are you sure?

16:56.448 --> 16:58.473
I'm not gonna see Chris anymore.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.344
I don't want him to come between us.

17:01.420 --> 17:03.820
I just don't want anything
to come between us.

17:11.195 --> 17:14.165
-Lucas.
-You told my mom about the heart test.

17:16.602 --> 17:19.469
I'm glad she knows,
if it forces you to reconsider.

17:20.271 --> 17:21.704
You promised me.

17:23.776 --> 17:24.970
Lucas.

17:26.979 --> 17:28.970
What did you see when you died?

17:30.249 --> 17:32.774
After the accident,
when your heart stopped...

17:33.485 --> 17:34.850
what did you see?

17:36.588 --> 17:38.988
Because when my heart failed, I saw you.

17:40.025 --> 17:42.493
Your mother can't bear to lose you.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.354
Neither can I.

17:55.841 --> 17:57.536
I rang the doorbell.

17:59.978 --> 18:02.811
I know, I just didn't want to answer it.

18:05.818 --> 18:08.184
I'm sorry I blew you off at lunch today.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.414
You know,
it's really starting to be a pattern...

18:10.489 --> 18:13.049
you showing up in my room
to apologize to me.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.260
You're right, but....

18:22.367 --> 18:24.062
At my last school...

18:25.370 --> 18:27.395
there were some rumors about me.

18:28.073 --> 18:31.804
About a relationship
I was having with another girl.

18:35.547 --> 18:39.210
I tried to ignore it,
but the stories just kept getting worse.

18:40.419 --> 18:43.286
Until, finally,
my parents decided to move us here.

18:44.323 --> 18:46.848
And that's why Felix
is so protective of me.

18:47.926 --> 18:50.190
He was really happy in our last town.

18:50.762 --> 18:53.697
Okay, but I thought you said
they were just rumors.

18:54.032 --> 18:55.693
It doesn't matter.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.333
You know how high school is.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.999
Once a story gets out...

19:02.274 --> 19:04.003
it might as well be true.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.875
So when I saw your locker...

19:07.946 --> 19:10.574
and the way
that people were looking at you...

19:11.383 --> 19:14.216
I guess it scared me.

19:16.221 --> 19:18.917
It was a horrible time for me, Peyton.

19:24.463 --> 19:26.863
-What are you gonna do?
-I don't know.

19:27.733 --> 19:31.260
You could always just let it go.
I mean, you're not gay...

19:32.104 --> 19:33.298
right?

19:35.007 --> 19:36.304
Come here.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.309
Read that.

19:46.385 --> 19:50.754
''First they put away the dealers,
then they put away the prostitutes...

19:51.256 --> 19:55.522
''then they shooed away the bums,
and beat and bashed the queers.

19:57.829 --> 20:01.287
''Turned away asylum seekers,
fed us suspicions and fears.

20:01.733 --> 20:04.600
''We didn't raise our voice,
we didn't make a fuss.

20:04.736 --> 20:06.761
''It's funny, there was no one left
to notice--

20:06.838 --> 20:08.635
''When they came for us.''

20:10.309 --> 20:12.539
Anna, it's not about who I am, okay?

20:12.611 --> 20:15.739
It's about who they are.
They are people who hate...

20:15.814 --> 20:19.272
and they divide and they feed off people
that don't fight back.

20:21.286 --> 20:25.950
Yeah, I could laugh this off.
But what about the girl that can't?

20:26.825 --> 20:28.349
Who's gonna help her?

20:30.395 --> 20:32.488
Silence only makes them stronger.

21:14.439 --> 21:17.533
Hey, Haley. You here to see Chris?

21:25.083 --> 21:26.209
Sorry.

21:27.586 --> 21:31.352
You know what?
I'll catch him later, it's okay.

21:50.776 --> 21:52.903
-Keith?
-Hey.

21:57.349 --> 21:59.112
I accepted Dan's offer.

22:01.453 --> 22:04.786
You know, Charleston was always about...

22:06.224 --> 22:07.919
hope for me, Jules.

22:08.460 --> 22:11.327
A place where, maybe,
I could find something special.

22:12.197 --> 22:14.256
But I found that right here...

22:16.468 --> 22:17.696
with you.

22:20.706 --> 22:22.640
You've given me that hope.

22:29.081 --> 22:32.244
You are the best. What do I owe you?

22:33.151 --> 22:36.052
Nothing. I called in a couple favors.

22:36.521 --> 22:38.284
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

22:38.357 --> 22:39.722
Hi, Brooke.

22:43.261 --> 22:45.229
-You ready?
-Yeah.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.661
Okay, bye.

22:49.134 --> 22:52.934
-So....
-I guess I'll see you at school.

22:54.272 --> 22:55.364
Yeah.

23:35.280 --> 23:38.147
-Hey, Luke. Can I talk to you?
-Yeah.

23:44.022 --> 23:45.990
I heard that you fixed Brooke's windshield.

23:46.057 --> 23:48.890
-Yeah, you know, she needed some help.
-I want to pay for it.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.655
I took some money out of the bank.

23:50.729 --> 23:53.129
-Mouth, you don't have to do that.
-Please.

23:53.198 --> 23:55.132
-I want to.
-Mouth.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.065
I'm the one who did it.

23:58.670 --> 24:00.297
I broke her windshield.

24:06.344 --> 24:07.709
Miss Sawyer.

24:07.913 --> 24:11.906
You know we have a policy regarding
wardrobe that is offensive or profane.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.419
Does that policy extend to lockers?

24:14.486 --> 24:16.716
'Cause you haven't removed that yet,
have you?

24:16.788 --> 24:17.880
You know the drill.

24:17.956 --> 24:20.424
Go to the office and change
or be sent home.

24:21.626 --> 24:24.652
Okay, Mr. Turner,
have you ever heard of Victor Jara?

24:25.831 --> 24:27.958
No? He was this musician.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.766
He fought injustice with his songs,
and when they broke his hands...

24:31.837 --> 24:34.203
and when they taunted him,
he just sang even louder.

24:34.272 --> 24:35.603
Look, Peyton.

24:35.740 --> 24:38.436
Oppression's not exactly
a mystery to me, okay?

24:39.478 --> 24:41.878
-I feel your pain.
-No, you don't.

24:42.414 --> 24:45.679
I'm sorry, but you don't know
anything about my pain.

24:45.951 --> 24:49.148
Maybe so. But there are counselors
you can talk to...

24:49.221 --> 24:52.452
-literature you can read--
-Okay, I'm not gay, Mr. Turner.

24:52.524 --> 24:55.288
But you know what? If I was,
I wouldn't let other people...

24:55.360 --> 24:57.055
tear me down because of it.

24:57.128 --> 25:01.394
And I sure as hell wouldn't be looking
for my answers in one of your pamphlets.

25:01.800 --> 25:05.600
The policy is clear, Peyton.
Remove the shirt or be suspended.

25:09.441 --> 25:10.669
Fine.

25:12.744 --> 25:14.974
Can you hear my song now, Mr. Turner?

25:18.450 --> 25:20.680
Enjoy your suspension, Miss Sawyer.

25:29.995 --> 25:32.327
You probably think I'm an idiot.

25:32.397 --> 25:34.797
Actually, I'm kind of hoping
you have an evil twin.

25:34.866 --> 25:37.198
Look, vandalizing Brooke's car....

25:37.269 --> 25:40.602
-Mouth, that's just not you.
-I guess that's why I did it.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.470
Girls see me as their little brother.

25:44.543 --> 25:48.001
-They always tell me how nice I am.
-That's 'cause you are nice.

25:48.113 --> 25:50.138
That's why you have
so many friends, Mouth.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.614
And no girlfriend.

25:52.350 --> 25:56.150
Haley fell for Nathan when he was a jerk,
Brooke went for Felix.

25:56.221 --> 26:00.317
Luke, you've screwed up a lot this year,
and you've had a different girl every week.

26:01.326 --> 26:03.988
Sorry, I just....

26:04.396 --> 26:06.489
I tried to be honest with Brooke.

26:06.932 --> 26:10.026
I told her the truth
and then she left with Felix anyway.

26:10.101 --> 26:13.969
-Yeah, to end things with him.
-But I didn't know that at the time.

26:14.973 --> 26:17.168
AII I knew was that,
I was at another party...

26:17.242 --> 26:19.472
where everybody had someone, but me.

26:22.080 --> 26:25.072
And then, I kind of got drunk.

26:25.150 --> 26:27.277
-You were drinking?
-Sort of.

26:28.787 --> 26:32.348
I had one drink, but it was a big one.

26:32.490 --> 26:34.720
The next thing I knew,
I was at Brooke's house.

26:34.793 --> 26:36.852
You drove to Brooke's house wasted?

26:36.928 --> 26:38.361
I rode my bike...

26:38.997 --> 26:40.862
I fell a couple times.

26:42.734 --> 26:45.259
In the morning,
I felt terrible about what I did...

26:45.337 --> 26:48.067
and even worse
when I found out you fixed it.

26:49.874 --> 26:52.775
-You know she thinks Felix did it.
-I know...

26:53.378 --> 26:55.710
and I'm gonna tell her the truth.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.748
You know, I like Brooke a lot.

27:02.487 --> 27:04.512
I guess I have, for a long time.

27:06.291 --> 27:08.782
But it was okay
when you guys were together.

27:10.328 --> 27:13.195
I guess I always thought
your hearts were the same.

27:32.250 --> 27:33.308
Hey!

27:34.486 --> 27:36.113
Hang on a second.

27:37.022 --> 27:38.489
What is this?

27:39.958 --> 27:42.756
-That should cover your window.
-Then you did do it.

27:42.827 --> 27:44.260
No, I didn't.

27:50.001 --> 27:52.299
-Who's the ho?
-She's not a ho.

27:52.704 --> 27:55.434
Her name's Kaela
and she was my last girlfriend.

27:56.341 --> 27:59.401
We dated for two years,
and I was never happier.

28:01.579 --> 28:04.707
Then one day, she passed me a note,
and that was it.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.278
I don't believe you...

28:06.351 --> 28:08.717
because you said
you only do friends with benefits.

28:08.787 --> 28:10.448
I have, since then.

28:10.755 --> 28:12.780
See, I was just like you, Brooke...

28:13.391 --> 28:14.722
doing friends with benefits...

28:14.793 --> 28:17.728
because I was afraid of getting
my heart broken again.

28:19.397 --> 28:21.331
But I guess it doesn't matter.

28:26.738 --> 28:29.332
I'm supposed to believe
you didn't break my windshield...

28:29.407 --> 28:31.432
but you're paying for it anyway?

28:32.110 --> 28:34.772
You don't have to believe it, any of it.

28:37.282 --> 28:38.772
But it's true.

28:52.997 --> 28:54.328
What's with them?

28:55.300 --> 28:57.427
Dan told my mom about the HCM test.

28:57.936 --> 29:01.303
I guess it's my bad
for trusting him to keep a secret, right?

29:01.372 --> 29:02.839
He didn't tell her.

29:04.909 --> 29:06.035
I did.

29:07.312 --> 29:09.473
-I told her.
-Why?

29:10.148 --> 29:13.345
Because I knew that if she found out,
she'd make you take the test.

29:13.418 --> 29:16.785
She's not gonna make me take the test.
And that sucks that you told her...

29:16.855 --> 29:18.379
after I covered for you with Haley!

29:18.456 --> 29:21.016
About where I crashed for a night,
not about my life.

29:21.092 --> 29:23.492
You know, whatever. You promised me.

29:23.895 --> 29:26.523
I guess Dan's not the only one I can't trust.

29:27.532 --> 29:29.261
Luke, he's right, man.

29:29.768 --> 29:32.498
I mean, you're wrong
not to take that test, dog.

29:32.904 --> 29:35.532
Come on, man,
it's not fair to us or your mom.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.241
Unbelievable.

29:37.809 --> 29:39.333
You know what, Skills...

29:39.511 --> 29:42.105
why don't you just run with Nathan
from now on?

29:42.180 --> 29:45.081
How about you take the test
and we all run together?

30:00.398 --> 30:02.093
-Hey.
-Hey.

30:02.867 --> 30:05.062
I was gonna call you in a while.

30:05.804 --> 30:09.137
I'm sorry to just drop by,
I just need somebody to talk to.

30:09.207 --> 30:10.299
Stop.

30:10.975 --> 30:12.875
I just.... I need you, Brooke.

30:16.214 --> 30:20.674
There's so much stuff piling up,
and I don't think I can handle it anymore.

30:20.752 --> 30:23.220
Okay, what's going on? Talk to me.
I mean...

30:23.288 --> 30:26.018
you said you're not feeling like yourself,
but what's wrong?

30:26.090 --> 30:27.421
Just everything.

30:27.492 --> 30:31.485
Karen is really counting on me
at the club and I don't even have a band.

30:31.796 --> 30:35.527
And I'm suspended, and that's
gonna look great on my transcripts...

30:38.536 --> 30:41.664
and I miss Jake and Jenny...

30:42.674 --> 30:46.337
-and my mom.
-Hey, it's gonna be okay.

30:46.411 --> 30:48.936
I should be stronger than this,
you know, I should.

30:49.013 --> 30:52.073
And I don't want to be a person
that needs help...

30:53.218 --> 30:54.947
but I feel all alone.

30:55.653 --> 30:57.280
You are not alone.

30:58.423 --> 31:00.789
You have me no matter what.

31:02.527 --> 31:03.619
Come here.

31:04.562 --> 31:07.531
I'm just glad
you're not seeing Felix anymore.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.030
I missed you.

31:11.269 --> 31:12.361
Yeah....

31:15.974 --> 31:16.998
Hey.

31:18.209 --> 31:20.006
-Oh, God.
-No.

31:20.078 --> 31:22.103
-No, I'm sorry to interrupt.
-No.

31:22.180 --> 31:24.512
-Peyton, don't go.
-It's cool. I'll call you later.

31:24.582 --> 31:25.947
No, Peyton.

31:51.009 --> 31:52.977
-Hey.
-Hey.

31:53.344 --> 31:55.437
-Sounds good.
-Thanks.

31:55.947 --> 31:57.881
It's getting there, you know.

31:58.883 --> 32:00.111
Listen...

32:01.152 --> 32:04.747
I hope you know how much I appreciate
everything that you've done for me.

32:07.859 --> 32:11.022
But I don't really think
we should work together anymore.

32:11.896 --> 32:13.693
So he got to you? Nathan.

32:14.232 --> 32:17.065
No, I just think it's for the best, you know?

32:20.405 --> 32:21.838
It's just as well.

32:22.507 --> 32:24.907
You know those labels from New York.

32:25.877 --> 32:27.970
They offered me a showcase.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.443
I think I'm gonna take it.

32:30.581 --> 32:32.879
-Wow, that's great, Chris.
-Yeah.

32:33.284 --> 32:37.220
I'm leaving tonight, so I won't
be able to play the show at Tric anyway.

32:38.790 --> 32:41.315
So, I guess this is goodbye.

32:48.232 --> 32:49.392
Thanks.

32:52.203 --> 32:54.068
Wait, Haley, come here.

33:03.581 --> 33:06.414
-What are you doing?
-Haley.

33:07.251 --> 33:10.186
Is that what this is all about?
You just hitting on me?

33:10.254 --> 33:12.449
-Haley, it's okay.
-No, it's not okay.

33:12.523 --> 33:15.321
-I can't believe you just did that.
-I want you to take this.

33:15.393 --> 33:17.987
-Come with me to New York.
-What?

33:18.696 --> 33:20.721
In case you missed something,
I'm married.

33:20.798 --> 33:22.026
So you made a mistake.

33:22.100 --> 33:24.660
Are you gonna let that keep you
from the rest of your life?

33:24.736 --> 33:26.101
I did not make a mistake.

33:26.170 --> 33:29.003
You owe it to your music,
you owe it to yourself.

33:29.073 --> 33:33.203
Your dreams are a bus ride away.
I know you want this, Haley.

33:36.547 --> 33:39.846
No, you're wrong. I don't want any of it.

33:40.885 --> 33:43.285
It was always there between us, Haley...

33:44.655 --> 33:46.748
whether you admit it or not.

34:04.809 --> 34:07.403
-You're canceling your club night?
-Yeah.

34:09.112 --> 34:12.378
-Because of the rumors?
-Because I can't sing and dance.

34:14.619 --> 34:17.520
You know what?
I'd really rather be alone right now.

34:19.257 --> 34:21.282
Okay, but...

34:21.893 --> 34:24.190
I just wanted to tell you
how inspired I was...

34:24.262 --> 34:27.288
-when I saw you at school today.
-You know what? That's great.

34:27.364 --> 34:30.300
You were inspired,
but when I needed you to stand by me...

34:30.368 --> 34:33.337
you blew me off.
So I don't need you here now.

34:53.157 --> 34:55.387
Hey, Rick, it's Peyton.

35:03.434 --> 35:05.231
Hey, man. Come on in.

35:05.436 --> 35:07.370
-Is this my apology?
-No.

35:07.638 --> 35:10.903
This is Haley's apology.
I don't owe you one. You know why?

35:11.642 --> 35:15.544
Because nobody wants to lose you, Luke.
Not your mom, not Keith...

35:15.980 --> 35:17.607
not Haley, not me.

35:18.716 --> 35:21.549
-There's nothing wrong with my heart.
-Yeah?

35:21.652 --> 35:23.643
That's what you said
after your car accident.

35:23.788 --> 35:26.518
You told me you didn't want
to be afraid to live your life.

35:26.591 --> 35:28.525
-That's right.
-I don't buy it, Luke.

35:28.593 --> 35:31.357
I think there's something
in your heart you're running from.

35:31.429 --> 35:35.229
-What are you, psychic?
-You can make jokes about it all you want.

35:35.299 --> 35:38.291
You know there's a girl
you have feelings for.

35:38.369 --> 35:41.133
-Nathan--
-Look me in the eye, tell me I'm wrong.

35:43.674 --> 35:44.732
See?

35:45.243 --> 35:49.270
Now you can be mad at me all you want.
You can say your heart's fine.

35:49.347 --> 35:51.747
But until you tell this girl how you feel...

35:52.316 --> 35:54.181
your heart's gonna be flawed.

35:56.087 --> 35:58.021
You need to talk to her, Luke.

36:19.443 --> 36:23.880
Peyton, it's me. Will you call me back?
I'm worried about you, okay?

36:25.983 --> 36:29.544
-She'll be okay.
-You can go.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.613
Do I have to?

36:31.689 --> 36:33.122
-Felix.
-Brooke.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.488
Come on.

36:34.559 --> 36:36.823
Can I just say what I tried to say
at the formal?

36:36.894 --> 36:39.328
-I really wish you--
-I want to be with you.

36:39.764 --> 36:42.255
-...wouldn't.
-I know it was wrong to lie to you...

36:42.333 --> 36:44.164
about taking you home after Tric.

36:44.235 --> 36:46.760
But when you looked at me
the way you did...

36:47.538 --> 36:50.268
it felt so good to be looked at
like that again.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.866
Like you saw the real me...

36:53.744 --> 36:55.541
and you liked what you saw.

36:57.915 --> 37:01.146
-You can't do this to me.
-I can't not do it...

37:02.453 --> 37:04.717
because I'm tired of hiding from it.

37:06.090 --> 37:07.887
I just want you to know...

37:08.926 --> 37:11.053
I never once took you for granted.

37:12.630 --> 37:14.291
Not for a second.

37:26.277 --> 37:27.835
Deb, come in.

37:34.518 --> 37:36.349
I lied to you.

37:38.389 --> 37:39.981
I slept with Keith.

37:43.361 --> 37:45.124
Hey, Jules, it's Keith.

37:48.466 --> 37:51.162
I'm sorry to leave this
on your machine, but...

37:51.936 --> 37:54.564
I just realized something
and I had to say it.

37:56.240 --> 37:57.605
I love you.

37:58.743 --> 38:00.210
<i>Call me.</i>

38:09.987 --> 38:11.614
Nice work, Jules.

38:13.958 --> 38:15.448
Just like we planned.

38:41.352 --> 38:42.410
Hey.

38:43.888 --> 38:45.480
Sorry about this.

38:46.557 --> 38:50.618
-I just had to see you.
-Lucas, what's wrong?

38:52.296 --> 38:54.856
You know how much
I care about you, Anna...

38:56.033 --> 38:57.500
because I do.

38:59.904 --> 39:01.963
But there's somebody else...

39:04.575 --> 39:08.011
and she's a part of my history
that came before you...

39:10.114 --> 39:13.572
and I have been lying to myself
about the way I feel about her.

39:16.954 --> 39:18.922
And I need to see her tonight...

39:21.359 --> 39:23.759
because I feel like she's slipping away.

39:25.796 --> 39:28.594
I'm sorry, Anna.

39:39.477 --> 39:41.035
Looking for me?

39:43.013 --> 39:44.480
High school girls.

39:45.583 --> 39:47.244
Relax.

39:48.786 --> 39:50.617
Is this what you're after?

39:55.359 --> 39:57.088
You got some cash for me?

40:05.569 --> 40:07.196
You know this guy?

40:15.413 --> 40:16.812
Jake.

41:01.725 --> 41:03.124
I knew you'd come.

41:07.064 --> 41:09.965
I was on my way home to Nathan
and I just...

41:11.235 --> 41:12.566
ended up here.

41:13.771 --> 41:17.468
<i>Number 42 now departing</i>
<i>for New York City. Gate five.</i>

41:23.848 --> 41:25.145
You ready?

41:29.987 --> 41:31.420
Brooke, talk to me.

41:33.057 --> 41:35.753
Just tell me how you feel.

41:43.434 --> 41:45.402
I know it's scary...

41:45.769 --> 41:48.260
and I know you had a tough time
with Lucas...

41:49.707 --> 41:52.767
but just tell me
if you can show me your heart.

41:52.843 --> 41:55.676
Because if you do, I'll guard it with my life.

42:00.818 --> 42:02.080
Just say okay.

42:05.489 --> 42:06.581
Okay.

43:20.397 --> 43:21.386
