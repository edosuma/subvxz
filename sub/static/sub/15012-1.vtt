00:40.849 --> 00:43.419
February 14, 1929...

00:43.519 --> 00:46.755
the year of the black bottle,
six-day bicycle races...

00:46.855 --> 00:50.843
flagpole sitting, and the first flight
from Paris to New York.

00:50.943 --> 00:53.053
Mickey Mouse makes his screen debut...

00:53.153 --> 00:57.349
and Herbert Hoover is inaugurated
as the 31 st president with the words...

00:57.449 --> 01:01.645
"We in America today are nearer
to the final triumph over poverty...

01:01.745 --> 01:04.022
than ever before in any land."

01:04.122 --> 01:07.192
Six months later, the New York
stock market will crash...

01:07.292 --> 01:10.654
and bring about the greatest
depression in world history.

01:10.754 --> 01:14.158
In the city of Chicago,
the time is 10:25 a.m.

01:14.258 --> 01:17.261
The temperature... 18 above zero.

02:24.995 --> 02:27.564
Oh, my God.

02:27.664 --> 02:30.334
My God!

03:48.203 --> 03:50.689
In the years following the passage...

03:50.789 --> 03:53.108
of the National
Prohibition Act of 1920...

03:53.208 --> 03:56.987
the nation's underworld rises to power
and battles amongst itself...

03:57.087 --> 03:59.865
just as modern nations
and corporations do.

03:59.965 --> 04:03.202
Open periods of gang warfare are
followed by peace treaties...

04:03.302 --> 04:05.537
and attempts at consolidation
and monopoly...

04:05.637 --> 04:08.165
each of which is shattered
as new warfare erupts...

04:08.265 --> 04:11.210
in quest of the booming
bootlegging and vice profits.

04:11.310 --> 04:17.132
By 1929, the gangs of Chicago
operate 21,207 speakeasies...

04:17.232 --> 04:21.011
and their gross income
reaches $357 million.

04:21.111 --> 04:23.680
Six hundred and 18 members
of the city's underworld...

04:23.780 --> 04:25.891
are murdered within nine years.

04:25.991 --> 04:28.018
Corruption extends
from the mayor's office...

04:28.118 --> 04:30.270
to the humblest side-street speakeasy.

04:30.370 --> 04:32.398
Tell your lousy sister
to keep her lousy mouth shut!

04:32.498 --> 04:34.400
Do me a favor, will you?

04:34.500 --> 04:37.044
I mean, just to give
her tonsils a break...

04:42.299 --> 04:44.218
Two beers.

04:52.434 --> 04:54.837
Nice place you got here.

04:54.937 --> 04:56.855
Thanks.

04:59.566 --> 05:01.844
Do a nice business, huh?

05:01.944 --> 05:04.571
Pays the rent.

05:05.864 --> 05:07.825
What are you trying to do, poison me?

05:10.869 --> 05:14.690
If you don't like the beer, mister,
you don't have to pay for it.

05:14.790 --> 05:17.359
Well, now, ain't you the cat's pajamas?

05:17.459 --> 05:19.361
Did you hear that, Jimmy?

05:19.461 --> 05:22.865
Bright eyes here says
we don't have to pay for this slop.

05:22.965 --> 05:25.784
How 'bout it, bud?
You're drinking this stuff.

05:25.884 --> 05:29.038
Tastes terrible, don't it?

05:29.138 --> 05:32.182
I guess I'm not what
you'd call much of a judge.

05:35.644 --> 05:39.048
What's the matter?
Don't you know when something stinks?

05:39.148 --> 05:41.050
I guess I drunk better at that.

05:41.150 --> 05:44.219
Ah, ya hear that?
Even your friend don't like it.

05:44.319 --> 05:46.972
What more do you want?

05:47.072 --> 05:49.575
All right, bright eyes,
where you getting it?

05:51.201 --> 05:53.729
Fellow named Slauson.

05:53.829 --> 05:56.565
Slauson, Slauson...

05:56.665 --> 05:59.318
Only Slauson I know works for Capone.

05:59.418 --> 06:01.320
Al Capone.

06:01.420 --> 06:04.490
That wouldn't be the same
Slauson, would it?

06:06.592 --> 06:08.827
I think it is.

06:08.927 --> 06:12.539
- How much you move in a week?
- Five barrels.

06:12.639 --> 06:16.001
Five? A swell joint like you got here?

06:16.101 --> 06:19.004
With the right kind of beer,
you could double that, easy.

06:19.104 --> 06:22.174
I'm gonna put 10 barrels in here
tomorrow morning, cost you $55 a barrel.

06:22.274 --> 06:24.343
Look, mister, you trying
to get me knocked off?

06:24.443 --> 06:26.345
I can't buck Capone. Neither can Moran.

06:26.445 --> 06:29.014
Moran?

06:29.114 --> 06:31.934
Only Moran I know drives a streetcar.

06:32.034 --> 06:35.954
That, uh... That wouldn't be
the same Moran, would it?

06:37.706 --> 06:39.500
My mistake.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.861
That's okay. Anybody can make a mistake.

06:42.961 --> 06:47.324
Take me. Why, I could even
be wrong about your beer.

06:47.424 --> 06:51.370
Maybe it's swell,
and it's just you got dirty pipes.

06:51.470 --> 06:53.430
Happens.

06:57.559 --> 07:00.546
Well, now, you know
what you got there, bright eyes.

07:00.646 --> 07:03.465
It's not the pipes at all.
It's green beer.

07:03.565 --> 07:05.609
Here, you can smell it.

07:08.445 --> 07:10.656
See what I mean?

07:19.122 --> 07:24.611
Peter Gusenberg-born Chicago,
Illinois, September 22 of 1898.

07:24.711 --> 07:27.906
Ex-convict. Mail-robber. Burglar.

07:28.006 --> 07:30.617
Hijacker. Professional killer.

07:30.717 --> 07:34.705
When, at the age of 13, he came home
from school to find his mother dead...

07:34.805 --> 07:39.084
his first act was to pry the wedding ring
from her finger and pawn it.

07:39.184 --> 07:44.523
He has been a member of Bugs Moran's
North Side gang for the past seven years.

07:52.406 --> 07:56.743
Ten barrels, starting tomorrow.

07:59.872 --> 08:03.917
And don't forget...
I'm doing you a big favor.

08:40.913 --> 08:42.815
Frank Gusenberg...

08:42.914 --> 08:44.858
younger brother of Peter Gusenberg...

08:44.958 --> 08:48.195
born Chicago, Illinois,
October 11, 1902.

08:48.295 --> 08:52.199
Burglar. Car thief. Extortionist.
Professional gunman.

08:52.299 --> 08:55.494
Member of the North Side gang
for the past nine years.

08:55.594 --> 08:57.871
He is married to two women
simultaneously...

08:57.971 --> 09:00.057
but lives with neither.

09:26.959 --> 09:31.030
Vincenzo DeMora, alias
"Machine Gun" Jack McGurn...

09:31.130 --> 09:34.533
born Brooklyn, New York, July 7, 1903.

09:34.633 --> 09:37.202
When he was nine years old,
his father was murdered.

09:37.302 --> 09:39.455
By the time he was 20,
he had personally killed...

09:39.555 --> 09:42.082
every man connected
with his father's death.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.835
He has recently become a top
trigger man and extortionist...

09:44.935 --> 09:47.254
in the Capone organization.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.982
Just where the hell were you?

09:51.275 --> 09:53.635
Nothing I could do, Jack.

09:53.735 --> 09:56.680
Guy came up like
right out of the woodwork.

09:56.780 --> 09:59.725
First I know, the door is open
and he's blasting away.

09:59.825 --> 10:02.619
- Did you make him?
- Yeah.

10:05.581 --> 10:10.169
One of Moran's boys. Frank Gusenberg.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.896
Alphonse Capone...

10:45.996 --> 10:48.941
alias Al Capone, alias Al Brown...

10:49.041 --> 10:52.945
born Castellamare, Italy,
January 6, 1899.

10:53.045 --> 10:56.281
No criminal record.
Raised in a Brooklyn slum.

10:56.381 --> 10:59.493
He has migrated to Illinois
early in 1919.

10:59.593 --> 11:01.745
Shrewd, ambitious,
and utterly ruthless...

11:01.845 --> 11:05.958
Capone in six short years has climbed
from the status of saloon bouncer...

11:06.058 --> 11:10.129
to become unchallenged leader of Chicago's
most powerful underworld organization.

11:10.229 --> 11:12.631
To his associates,
he is "The Big Fellow."

11:12.731 --> 11:15.426
To the public,
he is "Scarface" Al Capone.

11:15.526 --> 11:17.886
Thank you, Mr. Capone.

11:17.986 --> 11:21.807
Sorry about that raid, Jake. I got a new
captain out there who won't play ball.

11:21.907 --> 11:24.059
- What's wrong with him?
- Playing hard to get.

11:24.159 --> 11:26.061
We had him put down for a yard a week.

11:26.161 --> 11:29.064
He says if we want to operate
in his district, we gotta triple that.

11:29.164 --> 11:33.235
Three hundred, huh? Those guys
must think we're made of money.

11:33.335 --> 11:36.822
Write me out his name. I'll have
the bum transferred to the sticks.

11:36.922 --> 11:38.824
If it helps get him reelected...

11:38.924 --> 11:42.077
half a million in Thompson's
campaign fund's a bargain.

11:42.177 --> 11:44.663
They put Cermak in the mayor's office...

11:44.763 --> 11:47.249
and we're gonna lose 20 million a year.

11:47.349 --> 11:49.251
That's a waste of dough.
We bought one mayor.

11:49.351 --> 11:51.253
He loses out, we buy the next one.

11:51.353 --> 11:53.255
You don't know Tony Cermak, Frank.

11:53.355 --> 11:55.257
Charles "The Fixer" Fischetti...

11:55.357 --> 11:58.093
born Castellamare, Italy,
August 11, 1891.

11:58.193 --> 12:00.095
A second cousin to Al Capone...

12:00.195 --> 12:02.473
Fischetti acts as chairman
at executive meetings.

12:02.573 --> 12:04.808
He his a heavy drinker but never drunk.

12:04.908 --> 12:07.019
His principle value
to the organization...

12:07.119 --> 12:09.313
is his ability
to suborn political leaders...

12:09.413 --> 12:12.232
and public officials
on both state and city levels.

12:12.332 --> 12:15.319
He will be murdered on April 7, 1951.

12:15.419 --> 12:17.363
...and that's where we can get hurt.

12:17.463 --> 12:19.740
He ever tries chiseling
on the Big Fellow's rackets...

12:19.840 --> 12:21.742
he'll think a suitcase fell on him.

12:21.842 --> 12:24.428
Ah, come on, Frank. You know...

12:33.145 --> 12:35.147
Hello, Al.

13:02.257 --> 13:04.259
Meeting will come to order.

13:06.804 --> 13:08.872
Jake.

13:08.972 --> 13:13.127
Jake, we got you down here
for a report on the stockyards district.

13:13.227 --> 13:16.046
How's everything going down there?

13:16.146 --> 13:20.651
I'll read you the figures
and let you tell me, okay?

13:22.361 --> 13:27.266
We took over that territory from Joe
Saltas at the end of last October...

13:27.366 --> 13:30.769
and right away things got better.

13:30.869 --> 13:33.147
For example...

13:33.247 --> 13:36.567
beer sales for the 30-day period
ending December 15...

13:36.667 --> 13:38.736
are up 21.4...

13:38.836 --> 13:40.738
Jake "Greasy Thumb" Guzik...

13:40.838 --> 13:44.366
born Peoria, Illinois, November 9, 1894.

13:44.466 --> 13:48.579
A one-time proprietor of a string
of suburban houses of prostitution...

13:48.679 --> 13:51.790
Guzik is now in charge of all
bootlegging, sales and distribution...

13:51.890 --> 13:53.959
for the Capone syndicate.

13:54.059 --> 13:58.380
He will die of natural causes
on July 11, 1956.

13:58.480 --> 14:01.967
Huh. I've been telling you guys for months
that when it comes to selling beer...

14:02.067 --> 14:04.678
that big Polack don't know
his hat from third base.

14:04.778 --> 14:08.849
For Christ's sake! All I get
outta you guys is talk!

14:08.949 --> 14:10.851
The rest of the time,
you're strutting around...

14:10.951 --> 14:13.187
with dollar cigars in your kissers
like a bunch of bankers!

14:13.287 --> 14:15.856
Oh, big shots.

14:15.956 --> 14:18.108
What... what's wrong, Al?

14:18.208 --> 14:20.127
What's wrong?

14:22.504 --> 14:25.699
You guys just get off
the boat or something?

14:27.926 --> 14:31.388
Am I the only guy around here
knows what's going on in this town?

14:37.019 --> 14:40.339
Now let me give you some real facts...

14:40.439 --> 14:43.342
not the kind of love
and kisses we've been getting...

14:43.442 --> 14:46.011
from our good pal Jake here.

14:46.111 --> 14:48.722
Nobody has to tell me
we're making money...

14:48.822 --> 14:51.266
out in the stockyards
or anyplace else...

14:51.366 --> 14:54.203
on the South Side or the West Side.

14:54.328 --> 14:57.564
But what about the North Side, Jake?

14:57.664 --> 14:59.900
I don't hear no nice
fat figures on that!

15:00.000 --> 15:04.321
Or maybe you figure that end of town
ain't worth holding on to.

15:04.421 --> 15:07.116
We talked about this, Al.

15:07.216 --> 15:09.952
Yeah, we talked about it.

15:10.052 --> 15:12.037
You talked about it!

15:12.137 --> 15:15.666
"We don't want no trouble, Al."
"Forget about it, Al."

15:15.766 --> 15:18.602
"Bugs Moran's just showing off, Al."

15:24.817 --> 15:27.136
That's what I think
of your figures, Jake!

15:27.236 --> 15:29.780
Now you're gonna get some of my figures!

15:31.490 --> 15:34.935
Since Labor Day, Bugs Moran's...

15:35.035 --> 15:37.104
Bugs!

15:37.204 --> 15:39.773
Pushed our beer out of 28...

15:39.873 --> 15:42.568
28 joints south of Chicago Avenue alone.

15:42.668 --> 15:44.903
That don't sound like much, does it?
Twenty-eight joints.

15:45.003 --> 15:47.656
What's 28 joints out of 12,000?
Peanuts, right?

15:47.756 --> 15:50.325
- Right?
- Al, if you'd just listen to reason...

15:50.425 --> 15:52.678
Shut up, Charlie!
Right now I'm doing the talking!

15:56.098 --> 15:58.559
There's something else.

16:00.394 --> 16:02.755
Take our pal Jack McGurn here.

16:02.855 --> 16:05.632
Now, Jack's a nice fellow.
Does as he's told. Keeps his nose clean.

16:05.732 --> 16:08.719
I wish I had a couple
of hundred like him.

16:08.819 --> 16:11.764
So what happens here a month ago?

16:11.864 --> 16:17.077
Damned if a punk of Moran's
don't up and turn a chopper loose on him!

16:18.620 --> 16:20.622
Tony Lombardo.

16:22.833 --> 16:24.751
My pal Tony.

16:26.462 --> 16:28.364
I went to his funeral.

16:28.464 --> 16:32.368
I cried at his funeral.
I bawled like a baby.

16:32.468 --> 16:37.122
Here's a guy never carried
a gun in his whole life.

16:37.222 --> 16:40.626
Middle of the Loop,
4:30 in the afternoon...

16:40.726 --> 16:43.128
two slugs through
the back of the head...

16:43.228 --> 16:45.839
put there by a couple
of Bugs Moran's red hots!

16:45.939 --> 16:47.841
Al, now, now, just think a minute, huh?

16:47.941 --> 16:50.344
I mean, going after Moran,
it just ain't good business.

16:50.444 --> 16:54.807
Business!
I'm talking about staying alive!

16:54.907 --> 16:57.851
Try getting it
through your cement head...

16:57.951 --> 17:01.647
that what Moran's pulled so far,
that's just for openers!

17:01.747 --> 17:04.233
He wants me! He wants me dead!

17:04.333 --> 17:07.111
The way Dion O'Bannion wanted me dead!

17:07.211 --> 17:09.946
The way Hymie Weiss wanted me dead!

17:10.047 --> 17:12.407
Right down there on 22nd street!
Middle of the day!

17:12.508 --> 17:15.719
Damned if that crazy Polack don't
come looking for me with a whole army!

19:57.422 --> 20:00.050
That was Hymie Weiss for you.

20:00.175 --> 20:02.995
And right now, Moran's getting set...

20:03.095 --> 20:06.081
to pull something just as crazy.

20:06.181 --> 20:08.834
Well, the hell with that!

20:08.934 --> 20:12.187
We're gonna get him before he gets me!

20:14.439 --> 20:19.903
I want that Irish son of a bitch... hit.

20:22.447 --> 20:24.349
All right, Al.

20:24.449 --> 20:26.935
You want Moran hit, we hit.

20:27.035 --> 20:29.480
Of course, it's gonna
take a little time.

20:29.580 --> 20:33.817
All right, now wait a minute.
All right, Al, you're sore.

20:33.917 --> 20:36.695
Okay, nobody's saying you
haven't got a right to be sore.

20:36.795 --> 20:38.697
But, now, you remember...

20:38.797 --> 20:40.799
You want to argue with me, Charlie?

20:53.437 --> 20:56.715
Work it out, Frank. Only make it quick.

20:56.815 --> 21:00.552
Quick? I don't know.
To tell the truth, Al...

21:00.652 --> 21:03.389
there's a whole lot about the guy
we don't know to begin with.

21:03.489 --> 21:07.059
Francesco Nittoni,
alias Frank "The Enforcer" Nitti...

21:07.159 --> 21:10.396
born Montedoro, Sicily, January 9, 1887.

21:10.496 --> 21:13.982
Nitti is in charge of the Capone
organization's punishment squad...

21:14.082 --> 21:17.194
made up of accomplished
strong-arm men and professional killers.

21:17.294 --> 21:21.782
On March 19, 1943, while under
indictment for income tax evasion...

21:21.882 --> 21:25.369
Nitti will use a gun for the last time...
to take his own life.

21:25.469 --> 21:28.622
...before we could take the chance
to put him on the spot at all.

21:28.722 --> 21:32.376
I don't want to hear all that.
Everybody wants to argue!

21:32.476 --> 21:34.367
I told you what to do.
How long is it going to take?

21:34.467 --> 21:36.719
I don't know what to tell you.
Honest, I don't.

21:36.819 --> 21:39.741
- Like I told you, we got nothing to go on.
- I can't hear you, Frank.

21:41.151 --> 21:43.721
Five weeks. Six at the most.

21:43.821 --> 21:47.699
Six weeks? What are you gonna use
on him, a bow and arrow?

21:51.370 --> 21:53.272
Something on your mind, Jack?

21:53.372 --> 21:56.775
Well, uh, yes, sir.

21:56.875 --> 22:00.654
Maybe I'm wrong to butt in like this...

22:00.754 --> 22:04.116
but the last couple of months I've been
doing a little checking up on Moran.

22:04.216 --> 22:08.037
He lives at the Belden Essex Apartments
on Lincoln Park West.

22:08.137 --> 22:11.582
Apartment 5-C.
Uses the name George Miller.

22:11.682 --> 22:14.168
He's crazy about his wife and kid.

22:14.268 --> 22:16.503
He stays home most nights.

22:16.603 --> 22:19.798
Never goes anywhere without two torpedoes...
Willie Marks and Ted Newberry...

22:19.898 --> 22:22.468
both bad guys to tangle with.

22:22.568 --> 22:25.804
If that's any help, Mr. Capone.

22:25.904 --> 22:29.533
You left something out, Jack...
where he buys his BVDs.

22:32.536 --> 22:35.105
I said I wish I had a couple
of hundred like him.

22:35.205 --> 22:37.775
Now you know why.

22:37.875 --> 22:39.793
Come here, Jack.

22:47.217 --> 22:49.119
You want to know something, Jack?

22:49.219 --> 22:52.306
I like a guy who can use his head
for something besides a hat rack.

22:55.601 --> 22:58.587
And seeing as how you know
so much about Moran...

22:58.687 --> 23:01.482
I'm giving you the job
of getting rid of him.

23:02.566 --> 23:05.511
If that's okay with you, Frank.

23:05.611 --> 23:09.114
I got no objections.

23:10.741 --> 23:13.519
- Think you can handle it, kid?
- Yes, sir.

23:13.619 --> 23:16.246
There's just one thing, Mr. Capone.

23:17.748 --> 23:21.251
We may have to take some
of Moran's boys with him.

23:24.046 --> 23:27.257
I'll send flowers.

23:31.595 --> 23:33.497
I'm not scared of a war with Capone.

23:33.597 --> 23:35.874
It's gonna be him or me.

23:35.974 --> 23:39.211
If he'd stuck to his word
these past couple of years...

23:39.311 --> 23:41.547
it would be a different story.

23:41.647 --> 23:44.633
But every deal he's made, he's broken.

23:44.733 --> 23:47.219
O'Bannion thought
he could deal with him.

23:47.319 --> 23:49.279
Weiss did too.

23:50.656 --> 23:53.183
Well, I don't have to tell you
how they ended up.

23:53.283 --> 23:55.185
George Clarence Moran...

23:55.285 --> 23:59.273
born St. Paul, Minnesota, July 9, 1893.

23:59.373 --> 24:01.984
Ex-convict. Burglar. Horse thief.

24:02.084 --> 24:04.278
Hijacker. Suspected killer.

24:04.378 --> 24:08.532
Present leader of Chicago's notorious
and long-established North Side Mob...

24:08.632 --> 24:10.659
which, during the past five years...

24:10.759 --> 24:14.163
has been almost constantly at war
with the Capone organization...

24:14.263 --> 24:17.916
for control of the city's bootlegging
and gambling profits.

24:18.016 --> 24:22.046
During these five years, every previous
leader of the North Side gang...

24:22.146 --> 24:24.673
has been murdered
by the Capone interests.

24:24.773 --> 24:27.985
Hymie shook the dirty hand
of that rotten greaseball!

24:29.695 --> 24:33.474
Oh, sure, sure. We've been giving him
a lot of trouble lately.

24:33.574 --> 24:37.061
But I'm telling you here and now
that it's not enough.

24:37.161 --> 24:39.396
Not when you figure
what he's been doing to us...

24:39.496 --> 24:41.982
pushing his slop in our saloons...

24:42.082 --> 24:43.984
hijacking our trucks...

24:44.084 --> 24:47.154
and sending punks like that Jack McGurn
up here to snoop around.

24:47.254 --> 24:49.531
Well, that may be jake with you guys...

24:49.631 --> 24:51.533
but not me.

24:51.633 --> 24:55.204
I say it's time we put Al Capone
and his bums out of business.

24:55.304 --> 24:56.789
For good!

24:56.889 --> 25:00.459
George... with what?

25:00.559 --> 25:04.213
You can start a war with Capone,
but you're not going to win it.

25:04.313 --> 25:07.132
Not when every wop in town
is working for him.

25:07.232 --> 25:09.510
I know some that aren't...
Joe Aiello's mob.

25:09.610 --> 25:12.012
That five-and-dime punk?

25:12.112 --> 25:14.807
Capone don't even know he's alive.

25:14.907 --> 25:17.105
Jimmy, that's no way
to talk about our new partner.

25:17.205 --> 25:18.936
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

25:19.036 --> 25:21.730
- What is this, some kind of rib?
- Sit down, Frank.

25:21.830 --> 25:24.775
Since when do we hook up
with a bunch of crummy spics?

25:24.875 --> 25:26.777
You can count me out.

25:26.877 --> 25:29.363
Don't you pop off to me,
you stupid Kraut.

25:29.463 --> 25:32.090
When it comes to getting Capone,
I don't care who I use.

25:33.300 --> 25:35.202
You remember Deeny O'Bannion?

25:35.302 --> 25:37.204
Remember Hymie Weiss?
Well, you ought to...

25:37.304 --> 25:39.832
because you helped load
their coffins into the hearse.

25:39.932 --> 25:43.711
Or maybe when a friend of yours is gone,
you don't give a damn no more. Well, I do.

25:43.811 --> 25:46.839
And Deeny O'Bannion was my friend,
and I don't forget him.

25:46.939 --> 25:49.550
And I don't forget
who had him knocked off.

25:49.650 --> 25:52.553
Hymie Weiss and me, we was with Deeny...

25:52.653 --> 25:55.405
not 10 minutes before they got him.

25:56.824 --> 25:58.726
Now, remember those greaseballs.

25:58.826 --> 26:01.687
They'd just as soon put a bullet
in your back as eat a pizza.

26:01.787 --> 26:04.915
To hell with them Sicilians.
Be seeing you, Hymie.

26:11.964 --> 26:13.924
Morning, Johnny.

26:27.396 --> 26:29.648
Ah, good morning, boys.

27:12.774 --> 27:14.902
No.

28:06.662 --> 28:09.022
And that's the way Capone operates.

28:09.122 --> 28:13.944
That's the murdering double-crosser
who swore he'd keep out of the North Side.

28:14.044 --> 28:17.364
Well, I'm not waiting around
for Capone to put me in no cemetery.

28:17.464 --> 28:19.491
We nail him before he nails me.

28:19.591 --> 28:22.494
All right, let's nail him
to get it over with.

28:22.594 --> 28:24.663
I just say we do it without the help...

28:24.763 --> 28:27.833
of a two-bit spaghetti
snapper like Joe Aiello.

28:27.933 --> 28:31.253
Frank, you're a dummy, you know that?

28:31.353 --> 28:34.298
Capone's protection
comes from the Mafia.

28:34.398 --> 28:37.259
He can't make a move
without permission of the head wop.

28:37.359 --> 28:39.970
And he can't be the head himself
because he's not Sicilian.

28:40.070 --> 28:42.848
So he's got his own man,
Patsy Lolordo, running the outfit.

28:42.948 --> 28:47.603
Now, your spaghetti snapper,
Joe Aiello, is a pal of Lolordo's.

28:47.703 --> 28:51.398
He helps us knock over Lolordo,
then he takes over the Mafia.

28:51.498 --> 28:55.235
And that's when we take old Scarface
for a nice one-way ride.

28:55.335 --> 28:58.238
And if it don't work,
he'll take us for a ride.

28:58.338 --> 29:00.757
Well, it better work,
because I'm putting you in charge.

29:07.222 --> 29:09.333
Well, I'm not saying
it cannot be done...

29:09.433 --> 29:11.710
especially if Aiello gets us in there.

29:11.810 --> 29:14.671
Albert R. Kachellek,
alias James Clark...

29:14.771 --> 29:18.717
born Krojoencke, Germany,
February 25, 1888.

29:18.817 --> 29:22.388
Ex-convict. Burglar.
Car thief. Suspected killer.

29:22.488 --> 29:25.474
Since marrying Bugs Moran's
sister five years ago...

29:25.574 --> 29:28.685
he has become the number-two man
in the Moran gang.

29:28.785 --> 29:31.271
And then we need a good
driver for the getaway car.

29:31.371 --> 29:34.958
I don't care how you do it.
Just get rid of Patsy Lolordo. Quick.

29:45.969 --> 29:48.372
I learned how to drive
when I was young...

29:48.472 --> 29:50.374
John May...

29:50.474 --> 29:52.710
born Chicago, Illinois,
September 28, 1897.

29:52.810 --> 29:54.712
Married. Seven children.

29:54.812 --> 29:58.382
Twice arrested on charges of safe-blowing
and burglary. No convictions.

29:58.482 --> 30:02.052
Has worked occasionally for
the Moran gang as an auto mechanic.

30:02.152 --> 30:05.723
He has promised his wife he will stay
out of further trouble with the law...

30:05.823 --> 30:07.725
but he is three months
behind in the rent.

30:07.825 --> 30:10.436
I'd really like to help you out, Mr. Clark.
It's just that I don't...

30:10.536 --> 30:13.439
Up to you, Johnny.
You want to do us a favor, fine.

30:13.539 --> 30:16.567
If you don't, that's your luck out.

30:16.667 --> 30:18.235
Here, see?

30:18.335 --> 30:20.571
Well, I'm not really
a trigger man, you see?

30:20.671 --> 30:22.614
Matter of fact, I don't even own a gun.

30:22.714 --> 30:25.325
And if there were
any shooting to start...

30:25.425 --> 30:27.745
Well, I'd tell the cockeyed
world it won't be you.

30:27.845 --> 30:30.497
Think we want some lousy amateur
gummin' up the works?

30:30.597 --> 30:34.001
Why, I wouldn't even let
you kill my own mother.

30:34.101 --> 30:37.046
The Gusenbergs will do
their shooting, Johnny.

30:37.146 --> 30:41.008
All I'm asking you to do
is drive the car.

30:41.108 --> 30:44.178
That, and maybe use a little
muscle if things get rough.

30:44.278 --> 30:49.141
Pay's a hundred bucks.
Now, are you in, or out?

30:49.241 --> 30:51.977
It's a hundred bucks for the whole job?

30:52.077 --> 30:55.439
I'll do it.

30:55.539 --> 30:58.275
Besides, I really need the money.

30:58.375 --> 31:00.878
Come on, darlin'.
Don't you want any more?

31:54.306 --> 31:56.208
Nicholas Sorello...

31:56.308 --> 31:59.169
born Marsala, Sicily, May 13, 1872.

31:59.269 --> 32:02.214
Brought to the United States
by his cousin Dominic Forenza...

32:02.314 --> 32:04.216
when in his late 30's.

32:04.316 --> 32:07.678
Married with five children
and 11 grandchildren.

32:07.778 --> 32:10.556
He has had difficulty learning
the ways of the New World...

32:10.656 --> 32:12.725
and has lived in continual poverty.

32:12.825 --> 32:16.562
He will be murdered
on February 15, 1929...

32:16.662 --> 32:19.022
less than 24 hours after completion...

32:19.122 --> 32:22.417
of the only criminal
activity of his life.

32:36.056 --> 32:38.058
Come in.

32:41.353 --> 32:43.422
Mr. McGurn?

32:43.522 --> 32:46.692
- I'm Nick Sorello.
- Sit down, Nick.

32:48.235 --> 32:51.071
Want a drink? Something to eat?

32:52.781 --> 32:55.184
Thank you, no.

32:55.284 --> 32:58.979
It is kind of you to ask.

32:59.079 --> 33:01.732
Dominic Forenza says
you're a man can be trusted.

33:01.832 --> 33:07.212
Maybe that is because
my memory, it is very bad.

33:08.797 --> 33:10.866
What do you do for a living, Nick?

33:10.966 --> 33:12.868
I have the truck.

33:12.968 --> 33:16.872
Sometimes I'm selling the vegetables.

33:16.972 --> 33:20.501
Sometimes I'm in the moving business.

33:20.601 --> 33:24.505
It's very hard to get a good job
when you talk with accent.

33:24.605 --> 33:26.799
Yeah.

33:26.899 --> 33:29.051
Any trouble with the cops?

33:29.151 --> 33:32.262
No. One time, yes.

33:32.362 --> 33:35.849
They tell me I'm moving the, uh...

33:35.949 --> 33:38.185
stolen goods.

33:38.285 --> 33:40.829
I say, "I do not know this."

33:42.915 --> 33:45.818
They take what is in my truck.
They let me go.

33:45.918 --> 33:47.820
Same thing as in old country.

33:47.920 --> 33:50.798
It's no different here.

33:53.675 --> 33:56.578
Got a job for you, Nick.

33:56.678 --> 33:59.181
Bring it off, you get paid big.

34:01.266 --> 34:04.336
Five hundred bucks.

34:04.436 --> 34:08.297
It honors me to serve you, Mr. McGurn.

34:08.398 --> 34:10.551
You're gonna need a couple paisani...

34:10.650 --> 34:12.860
guys that can keep their traps shut.

34:14.780 --> 34:17.891
Sometime tonight there'll be a car
left in front of your house.

34:17.991 --> 34:20.518
It'll be hot, so ditch it
soon as the job's finished.

34:20.619 --> 34:23.063
Got that? Write this down.

34:23.163 --> 34:25.065
Tomorrow morning, 9:00 on the nose...

34:25.165 --> 34:27.234
you and your boys be on 33rd Street...

34:27.333 --> 34:29.695
half a block west of Robie.

34:29.795 --> 34:31.964
You're gonna need a gun.

34:32.965 --> 34:35.534
A gun?

34:35.634 --> 34:40.789
That is something
I do not have, Mr. McGurn.

34:40.889 --> 34:43.391
Guns make trouble.

35:12.671 --> 35:16.925
No bullets, no trouble, okay?

35:29.771 --> 35:31.773
Okay.

36:10.437 --> 36:12.339
Operator?

36:12.439 --> 36:14.466
Yeah, Lettie, get me the cops.

36:14.566 --> 36:17.219
I just seen a hijack being pulled off.

36:17.319 --> 36:20.264
Johnny and me got our
end of it down pat.

36:20.364 --> 36:23.934
Now all we need to know is...

36:24.034 --> 36:25.936
Yeah?

36:26.036 --> 36:29.231
Mr. Moran, it's Nick Sorello.

36:29.331 --> 36:32.067
Mr. Sorello, I don't think I know you.

36:32.167 --> 36:34.962
Yeah. Yeah.

36:35.645 --> 36:37.631
What label?

36:38.114 --> 36:40.701
How much you asking?

36:40.801 --> 36:43.829
All right, suppose you call me back
in an hour and a half.

36:43.929 --> 36:45.831
Yeah, do that.

36:45.931 --> 36:48.417
- What was all that about?
- A guy named Sorello.

36:48.517 --> 36:51.295
He's got 80-odd cases of Old Log Cabin
he wants to peddle.

36:51.395 --> 36:54.965
- Fifty-six bucks a case.
- Price seems all right.

36:55.065 --> 36:57.526
Yeah, but is he all right?

37:01.989 --> 37:05.726
Monroe 8099, please.

37:05.826 --> 37:08.312
Lieutenant Dellacosta, please.

37:08.412 --> 37:10.481
Oh, hello, Larry. This is George.

37:10.581 --> 37:12.483
Look, Larry, a couple of things.

37:12.583 --> 37:16.278
Let me know if your boys got anything
on a booze hijack last couple of days.

37:16.378 --> 37:19.073
Out near the stockyards. Right.

37:19.173 --> 37:23.619
And while you're at it, see if you got
a make sheet on a wop named Nick Sorello.

37:23.719 --> 37:26.872
Right. I'll call you back
in about an hour, okay?

37:26.972 --> 37:28.974
Thanks, Larry.

37:30.100 --> 37:32.378
Oh, sorry, Jim. What were you saying?

37:32.478 --> 37:35.089
Oh, just that we're about
ready to make our move.

37:35.189 --> 37:38.008
All we need now is to make sure
Lolordo's bodyguards...

37:38.108 --> 37:40.010
change shifts the same time every day.

37:40.110 --> 37:42.446
I've got a couple of boys
checking on that right now.

38:16.939 --> 38:19.441
Bang, bang! You're dead!

38:21.443 --> 38:23.679
Alphonse, bellissima.

38:23.779 --> 38:27.558
Pasqualino.

38:27.658 --> 38:29.618
Come in, come in.

38:46.718 --> 38:48.679
Grazie.

38:57.563 --> 38:59.465
Patsy, uh...

38:59.565 --> 39:02.551
Bugs Moran's been stepping out of line.

39:02.651 --> 39:05.971
I've, uh, told the boys
to go ahead and fix his wagon.

39:06.071 --> 39:08.390
This I do not like to hear, Alphonse.

39:08.490 --> 39:10.976
Maybe if you would talk things over...

39:11.076 --> 39:12.978
Talk, hell!

39:13.078 --> 39:15.481
I talked to O'Bannion,
and he laughed at me.

39:15.581 --> 39:18.108
I talked to Weiss. I pleaded with Weiss!

39:18.208 --> 39:20.736
Three times he tried
to have me bumped off!

39:20.836 --> 39:23.364
Now, Moran is just as bullheaded.

39:23.464 --> 39:26.325
You can't talk any sense
to these peasants.

39:26.425 --> 39:29.344
Every time I try it,
I wind up getting shot at!

39:36.977 --> 39:39.880
I'm not asking you, Patsy.
I'm telling you.

39:39.980 --> 39:42.107
I'm getting rid of Moran.

39:45.444 --> 39:49.181
You and I, we will not quarrel
over the life of a worthless man.

39:49.281 --> 39:51.600
I'm letting Jack McGurn handle it.

39:51.700 --> 39:53.852
He wants two Mafia boys
on the choppers...

39:53.952 --> 39:56.355
Scalise and Anselmi.

39:56.455 --> 39:58.774
Same dough we paid for
knocking off Hymie Weiss, okay?

39:58.874 --> 40:01.084
As you wish, my friend.

40:09.676 --> 40:13.455
Alphonse, something else
troubles you, no?

40:13.555 --> 40:15.708
Yeah.

40:15.808 --> 40:19.169
I've been hearing things, Patsy.

40:19.269 --> 40:22.381
You know how it is. You pick up
a word here and a word there...

40:22.481 --> 40:25.384
you put them together,
and pretty soon you got a picture.

40:25.484 --> 40:27.803
Maybe it's on the level,
and maybe it ain't.

40:27.903 --> 40:30.723
The way I get it...

40:30.823 --> 40:34.727
Joe Aiello is gonna take over
the Mafia in this town...

40:34.827 --> 40:37.062
and they got your name on a bullet.

40:37.162 --> 40:40.482
I have nothing to fear from Aiello.

40:40.582 --> 40:42.651
Don Giuseppe and I are as brothers.

40:42.751 --> 40:45.320
We attended the university
in Palermo together.

40:45.420 --> 40:48.073
We came to this country
only months apart.

40:48.173 --> 40:52.161
We are both members of the inner
counsel of the Brotherhood.

40:52.261 --> 40:56.623
No, Alphonse. I thank you very much
for your concern for me...

40:56.723 --> 40:59.835
but what you have heard is not true.

40:59.935 --> 41:01.812
I know this.

41:18.370 --> 41:20.272
Yeah?

41:20.372 --> 41:23.192
It's Nick Sorello.

41:23.292 --> 41:25.194
- Get in here.
- Get your...

41:25.294 --> 41:27.196
Who else you got out there, Nick?

41:27.296 --> 41:30.366
It's just a couple of...
Two of my good friends.

41:30.466 --> 41:32.743
- They come help me to...
- Get 'em in here.

41:32.843 --> 41:35.704
Hey, Mario! Joe!

41:35.804 --> 41:37.998
Avanti!

41:38.098 --> 41:40.584
Come on, come on!

41:40.684 --> 41:42.644
Come on!

41:55.032 --> 41:59.353
- What'd you have in mind, Nick?
- I ask your pardon, signor.

41:59.453 --> 42:03.065
It's only to watch the whiskey
I have the gun.

42:03.165 --> 42:06.210
You're a very naughty boy, Nick.

42:08.003 --> 42:10.464
All right, let's get it in here.

42:17.471 --> 42:19.373
Dr. Reinhart H. Schwimmer...

42:19.473 --> 42:22.459
born Chicago, Illinois,
September 1, 1896.

42:22.559 --> 42:24.837
Twice married, twice divorced.

42:24.937 --> 42:26.839
Schwimmer has no criminal record...

42:26.939 --> 42:31.093
but is one of that group of men who are
fascinated by the exploits of gangsters.

42:31.193 --> 42:33.512
In the last few months,
he has become acquainted...

42:33.612 --> 42:35.639
with the members
of the Moran organization...

42:35.739 --> 42:38.016
and spends a good deal of time
in their company.

42:38.116 --> 42:41.854
A licensed optometrist, he has
recently abandoned his practice...

42:41.954 --> 42:44.665
and is presently supported
by his widowed mother.

43:24.621 --> 43:27.082
Okay, Nick, get it unloaded.

43:28.917 --> 43:30.861
The money.

43:30.961 --> 43:33.739
Signor, first you pay me the money.

43:35.382 --> 43:38.635
Don't worry about it, Nick.
We'll send you a check.

43:40.971 --> 43:44.708
Your pardon, signor.

43:44.808 --> 43:49.421
Myself, I talked
to Mr. Moran on the telephone.

43:49.521 --> 43:53.050
He said, "Okay, Nick,
I pay you the cash"

43:53.150 --> 43:56.887
Fifty-six dollars a case
for the first-class stuff.

43:56.987 --> 43:59.681
Hey, you tasted, huh?

43:59.781 --> 44:02.434
It's first-class stuff, no?

44:02.534 --> 44:05.104
Okay.

44:05.204 --> 44:08.148
Now you pay me the money...

44:08.248 --> 44:10.709
we take 'em off-a the truck.

44:18.008 --> 44:20.285
Where'd you get it, Nick?

44:20.385 --> 44:24.748
Mr. Moran, he don't say that.
He just say...

44:24.848 --> 44:27.042
A little hijack job, huh, Nick?

44:27.142 --> 44:29.294
Got it off of Dingbat Oberta's
boys, right?

44:30.896 --> 44:33.424
We hear these things, Nick.

44:33.524 --> 44:37.194
You don't pay the Dingbat,
we don't pay you. That's fair.

44:44.868 --> 44:48.021
Okay, move it. You'll get your dough.

44:48.121 --> 44:50.040
Move.

44:55.546 --> 44:57.990
Adam Heyer, born Springfield,
Illinois...

44:58.090 --> 45:00.701
June 26, 1881.

45:00.801 --> 45:04.580
Criminal record: one conviction
for operating a confidence game.

45:04.680 --> 45:08.042
Married twice.
One child, a son by his first wife.

45:08.142 --> 45:10.044
As a qualified accountant...

45:10.144 --> 45:13.255
Heyer acts as bookeeper and collector
for the Moran organization...

45:13.355 --> 45:15.966
- Operator, get me Long Beach 1098...
- ...as well as handling payoffs...

45:16.066 --> 45:17.968
to local politicians and the police.

45:18.068 --> 45:20.095
His wife has been ill
for several years...

45:20.195 --> 45:22.973
and he is careful to conceal
the true nature of his business...

45:23.073 --> 45:25.726
from her and from their friends.

45:25.826 --> 45:28.896
They're all here, Mr. Gusenberg.

45:28.996 --> 45:30.914
Nick.

45:35.794 --> 45:38.572
Stuff checks out. Old Log Cabin uncut.

45:38.672 --> 45:40.174
How many cases?

45:40.274 --> 45:43.494
It's 82. Myself, I counted it.

45:43.594 --> 45:46.872
Nick wouldn't lie to us.
He wants to stay healthy.

45:46.972 --> 45:49.458
Ain't that right, Nick?

45:49.558 --> 45:52.586
That's 82 cases.

45:52.686 --> 45:55.130
Fifty-six dollars a case.

45:55.230 --> 45:58.734
That figures $4,592.

46:03.030 --> 46:05.599
One thousand, 2,000...

46:05.699 --> 46:09.353
3,000, 4,000...

46:09.453 --> 46:15.125
one, two, three, four, five.

46:16.502 --> 46:21.156
We'll make it, uh, even money... $4,500.

46:21.256 --> 46:23.867
Five hundred for handling charges, Nick.

46:23.967 --> 46:26.495
When we help unload
a truck, we get paid.

46:26.595 --> 46:28.514
Check?

46:30.641 --> 46:33.168
Thousand thanks, signor.

46:33.268 --> 46:37.047
Maybe we do business
again some more next time.

46:37.147 --> 46:39.049
You betcha, Nick!

46:39.149 --> 46:42.052
Nothing we like better
than doing business with bright boys.

46:42.152 --> 46:44.471
You're my idea of a bright boy.

46:44.571 --> 46:46.573
Yeah.

46:56.208 --> 46:59.611
Some of the money,
they steal it back from me.

46:59.711 --> 47:02.990
More than $500.

47:03.090 --> 47:05.284
I figured they would.

47:05.384 --> 47:07.911
In fact, I counted on it.

47:08.011 --> 47:10.914
You got one more job to do.

47:11.014 --> 47:13.876
Just when, I don't know yet.

47:13.976 --> 47:16.587
A real easy job, Nick.

47:16.687 --> 47:20.090
Just one simple phone call.

47:20.190 --> 47:22.551
Now remember, Pete.

47:22.651 --> 47:26.472
Frank'll pick you up
tomorrow afternoon at 3:30 sharp.

47:26.572 --> 47:29.892
At exactly 10 till 4:00,
both of you will pick up...

47:29.992 --> 47:33.437
Joe Aiello on the corner
of Walton and Pelilah.

47:33.537 --> 47:36.482
Now, the three of you
have got to be upstairs...

47:36.582 --> 47:39.401
at five to 4:00 on the nose.

47:39.501 --> 47:42.404
- You got all that?
- Don't worry about me. I can handle my end.

47:42.504 --> 47:44.406
You better do your
worrying about Aiello.

47:44.506 --> 47:48.035
I think he's all right, but if something
goes wrong, I'm counting on you, Pete.

47:48.135 --> 47:50.053
See you.

47:54.224 --> 47:56.210
As Mr. and Mrs. Peter J. Gorman...

47:56.310 --> 48:00.130
Peter Gusenberg and an ex-showgirl
named Myrtle Nelson Koppelman...

48:00.230 --> 48:04.343
have occupied Apartment 5C
at 434 Roscoe Street...

48:04.443 --> 48:06.403
for the past seven months.

48:36.183 --> 48:38.602
Hey, Myrt?

48:40.187 --> 48:43.190
You gonna lay there
reading that thing all night?

48:48.028 --> 48:49.930
You made me lose my place.

48:50.030 --> 48:54.159
Yeah? Come on over here.
I'll find it for you.

48:58.622 --> 49:00.749
What are you eating?

49:02.626 --> 49:05.362
What's it look like
I'm eating? A sandwich.

49:05.462 --> 49:08.032
Well, you could have made one for me.

49:08.132 --> 49:11.093
What's the matter?
You bust a leg or something?

49:19.685 --> 49:22.337
Pete, guess what?

49:22.437 --> 49:25.340
You know that coat
you got me for Christmas?

49:25.440 --> 49:29.653
You told me I could exchange it
because it was too big?

49:31.446 --> 49:33.348
So what?

49:33.448 --> 49:36.101
Well, I did, this afternoon...
for a nicer one.

49:36.201 --> 49:39.021
Nicer? What do you mean, nicer?

49:39.121 --> 49:41.857
That coat set me back 750 smackers.

49:41.957 --> 49:44.443
Oh, I know it did, Pete.

49:44.543 --> 49:47.363
You've been awful good to me.

49:47.463 --> 49:51.425
And don't you think for one minute
I don't appreciate it.

49:53.343 --> 49:57.806
It's just, well, this one
I couldn't resist. That's all.

49:59.349 --> 50:02.252
I know. You just sit right there.

50:02.352 --> 50:04.338
I'll go put it on for you.

50:04.438 --> 50:07.441
You'll see how nice it looks.

50:14.406 --> 50:16.558
Yowza, yowza, yowza.

50:16.658 --> 50:18.727
This is Ben, Bernie and all the lads...

50:18.827 --> 50:22.106
coming to you from the College Inn
of the Hotel Sherman.

50:22.206 --> 50:25.818
And now for all you lads and lassies
listening in the great Midwest...

50:25.918 --> 50:28.821
we're gonna play "Stumblin'."

50:28.921 --> 50:32.007
Let's stumble a bit, laddies.

50:40.432 --> 50:42.835
- Isn't it beautiful, Pete?
- How much?

50:42.935 --> 50:46.463
- You don't have to use that tone of voice.
- How much!

50:46.563 --> 50:50.300
It was a bargain, baby. They marked it
way down low. I just knew you'd want me...

50:50.400 --> 50:53.345
- Three thousand. That's all.
- Three grand!

50:53.445 --> 50:55.347
Why, you lousy little gold-digger!

50:55.447 --> 50:58.183
When I picked you out of the line,
all you had to your name...

50:58.283 --> 51:00.477
was a cloth coat with
monkey fur on the collar!

51:00.577 --> 51:02.688
Well, that goes back
tomorrow, you hear me? Back!

51:02.788 --> 51:05.999
Listen, you cheap gangster,
I'm gonna keep...

52:58.445 --> 53:02.057
Hey, you know you're
disturbing the peace?

53:02.157 --> 53:04.059
Let me in!

53:04.159 --> 53:06.603
Cheap gangster!
I'm gonna call the cops...

53:06.703 --> 53:08.939
When interviewed
by the press some weeks later...

53:09.039 --> 53:11.191
Myrtle Koppleman had this to say:

53:11.291 --> 53:14.069
Oh, Pete and I
have been married about a year.

53:14.169 --> 53:16.780
I can't remember exactly
where we were married...

53:16.880 --> 53:18.907
except that it wasn't in Illinois.

53:19.007 --> 53:21.618
I had no idea Pete was a gangster.

53:21.718 --> 53:23.954
He said he was a salesman.

53:24.054 --> 53:28.142
Truly a kinder, more gentle man...
you just couldn't meet one.

53:30.894 --> 53:33.797
On January 7,
the Moran gang puts into effect...

53:33.897 --> 53:37.051
its plan to murder Mafia
chieftain Patsy Lolordo.

53:37.151 --> 53:39.386
The first step is for
Pete and Frank Gusenberg...

53:39.486 --> 53:43.866
to use Joe Aiello's friendship for Lolordo
as a means to enter his apartment.

53:45.242 --> 53:48.829
- Your name Aiello?
- Aiello.

53:50.747 --> 53:52.666
Hop in.

53:54.293 --> 53:56.195
One thing I gotta know, Aiello.

53:56.295 --> 53:59.198
You positive this guy Lolordo
ain't setting us up for a double-cross?

53:59.298 --> 54:02.743
Don Pasqualino and I
are just like blood brothers.

54:02.843 --> 54:06.663
He truly believes we are calling
on him on a business matter.

54:06.763 --> 54:09.249
The men who guard him will know this...

54:09.349 --> 54:11.335
so they will allow us to enter.

54:11.435 --> 54:13.395
Capisce?

54:14.730 --> 54:16.857
Get in.

54:19.193 --> 54:21.111
Take it easy, Aiello.

54:24.948 --> 54:28.060
The second step
of the plan to murder Patsy Lolordo...

54:28.160 --> 54:31.121
is the systematic elimination
of his bodyguards.

56:07.551 --> 56:10.496
Pasqualino!

56:10.596 --> 56:13.557
Dio mio!

57:12.574 --> 57:14.268
Whoo!

57:14.368 --> 57:18.647
You know, Judge, the trouble with
this country today is its morals are shot.

57:18.747 --> 57:21.191
I mean, look at the young people.

57:21.291 --> 57:24.695
Girls smoking cigarettes
right on the streets...

57:24.795 --> 57:27.197
and necking in the back seat of a car...

57:27.297 --> 57:29.783
and wearing skirts so short
you can see everything they got.

57:29.883 --> 57:33.620
And fellas, packing a hip flask full of
rotgut whiskey, driving around half-drunk.

57:33.720 --> 57:35.956
You're perfectly right, Mr. Capone.

57:36.056 --> 57:39.543
I see them in my courtroom every day...
drunk, disorderly, defiant.

57:39.643 --> 57:41.545
I hardly know how to handle them.

57:41.645 --> 57:43.547
What these kids need, Your Honor...

57:43.647 --> 57:46.633
is a good working-over
with a razor strap on their bare behind.

57:46.733 --> 57:49.653
Boys and girls. If any kid of mine...

57:52.281 --> 57:55.450
Excuse me, Your Honor.

57:59.079 --> 58:02.124
Freshen up your drinks, folks.
I'll be right back.

58:13.010 --> 58:14.912
Hello?

58:15.012 --> 58:17.164
Yeah, yeah, this is Al.

58:17.264 --> 58:19.249
Who?

58:19.349 --> 58:21.835
Oh, hello, Marty.

58:21.935 --> 58:25.606
Now, what's so important you got to...

58:32.738 --> 58:34.698
Oh...

58:40.204 --> 58:42.122
Get the boys.

58:56.887 --> 58:59.056
What is it, Al?

59:00.057 --> 59:02.017
What's wrong?

59:05.646 --> 59:07.856
Patsy Lolordo.

59:09.733 --> 59:11.735
He's dead.

59:18.367 --> 59:22.604
Murdered him in his own house!

59:22.704 --> 59:26.124
Shot him! His friend!

59:34.591 --> 59:37.327
Al, there's people...

59:37.427 --> 59:39.747
Al!

59:39.847 --> 59:42.916
All right. Who killed him?

59:43.016 --> 59:45.753
Three men.

59:45.853 --> 59:48.505
Two of Moran's punks...

59:48.605 --> 59:52.176
and Giuseppe Aiello.

59:52.276 --> 59:54.945
Aiello?

59:57.156 --> 59:59.116
Yeah.

01:00:01.451 --> 01:00:04.855
What was it you were saying, Charlie?

01:00:04.955 --> 01:00:08.859
Talk to Moran, pay the guy to lay off?

01:00:08.959 --> 01:00:11.111
Give the poor guy a pass?

01:00:11.211 --> 01:00:13.197
- Al...
- Listen! Let me tell you something!

01:00:13.297 --> 01:00:15.199
I came that close to saying...

01:00:15.299 --> 01:00:19.036
"Maybe you're right for
the first time in your life."

01:00:19.136 --> 01:00:22.890
But no more, Charlie. Moran goes.

01:00:24.641 --> 01:00:26.877
And so does Aiello.

01:00:26.977 --> 01:00:30.230
Him, I take care of.

01:00:30.355 --> 01:00:33.300
You see that? Like an old man.

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:36.970
The union's out to get me. They already made
one try. They came at me with a shotgun.

01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:39.181
Next time shoot a couple back at them.

01:00:39.281 --> 01:00:42.351
I'm not a gunman, George.
I just wasn't cut out to be a gunman.

01:00:42.451 --> 01:00:44.603
What were you cut out for...
to sell neckties?

01:00:44.703 --> 01:00:47.689
Listen, you're in the rackets, brother,
same as the rest of us.

01:00:47.789 --> 01:00:50.984
And the kind of dough I'm paying you,
you either fight back or get out.

01:00:51.084 --> 01:00:53.987
I thought maybe I could run
one of your speaks for you.

01:00:54.087 --> 01:00:56.740
Now, that's my real line.
You know I'm good at it.

01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:58.742
I've got no jobs for saloon keepers.

01:00:58.842 --> 01:01:01.078
I don't know when I will have.

01:01:01.178 --> 01:01:04.056
Either keep the job you've got, or...

01:01:07.851 --> 01:01:10.671
Albert Wienshanker,
alias Albert Wienshank...

01:01:10.771 --> 01:01:14.133
born Chicago, Illinois,
December 23, 1893.

01:01:14.233 --> 01:01:16.135
No criminal record.

01:01:16.235 --> 01:01:19.513
Although Wienshank is not a gangster
in the usual sense of the word...

01:01:19.613 --> 01:01:23.183
he has been associated with the
North Side Mob for the past three years...

01:01:23.283 --> 01:01:26.019
first as an operator of speakeasies,

01:01:26.119 --> 01:01:31.567
now in charge of a non-union cleaning and
dyeing association controlled by Bugs Moran.

01:01:31.667 --> 01:01:34.236
Well, Bert, I know
it isn't easy for you...

01:01:34.336 --> 01:01:37.781
but you do a good job for me,
and I'd sure hate to lose you.

01:01:37.881 --> 01:01:41.118
Listen, why don't you go back home,
give it some more thought?

01:01:41.218 --> 01:01:43.412
Talk it over with Irene again.

01:01:43.512 --> 01:01:46.031
I'll be at the Clark Street garage
Thursday between 10:00 and 10:30.

01:01:46.131 --> 01:01:48.543
Stop by and let me know
one way or the other.

01:01:48.643 --> 01:01:52.880
 I'll do that. If I could just get Irene
to quit being so nervous...

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:55.340
- Well, you know how women are.
- Yeah.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.342
I can't thank you enough, George.

01:01:57.442 --> 01:01:59.803
Forget it. We're old pals,
remember? Hello?

01:01:59.903 --> 01:02:03.182
Mr. Moran? It's Nick Sorello.

01:02:03.282 --> 01:02:05.184
You remember me?

01:02:05.284 --> 01:02:07.644
Yeah, I remember you, Nick.
What about it?

01:02:07.744 --> 01:02:11.732
Maybe pretty soon I get some more.

01:02:11.832 --> 01:02:16.820
Same stuff, like before.
Same price, okay?

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:19.531
Yeah, I guess we can work something out.
How big a load?

01:02:19.631 --> 01:02:24.536
Uh, this I'm not sure.
I do not have delivery yet.

01:02:24.636 --> 01:02:28.374
You understand, Mr. Moran?

01:02:28.474 --> 01:02:31.710
Yeah, I understand.
How soon do you think it'll be?

01:02:31.810 --> 01:02:35.506
Maybe tomorrow. Or maybe two days.

01:02:35.606 --> 01:02:38.759
Okay, call us when you're ready.
I'll have the boys take delivery.

01:02:38.859 --> 01:02:42.054
Uh, Mr. Moran, is one thing.

01:02:42.154 --> 01:02:47.768
Last time, your boys,
they push me around a little bit.

01:02:47.868 --> 01:02:52.356
This time, I do business with you, okay.

01:02:52.456 --> 01:02:55.859
But with your boys, no.

01:02:55.959 --> 01:02:59.530
Okay, make it this Thursday morning around
10:30. Same place. I'll be there myself.

01:02:59.630 --> 01:03:02.241
I guarantee you'll get
everything that's coming to you.

01:03:02.341 --> 01:03:04.368
That's fine.

01:03:04.468 --> 01:03:08.664
Eh, to meet with you is my pleasure.

01:03:08.764 --> 01:03:12.226
Thank you, Mr. Moran.

01:03:13.644 --> 01:03:18.716
Mr. Moran.

01:03:18.816 --> 01:03:22.553
Why don't you step down here? I have
a beautiful LaSalle I think you'll like.

01:03:22.653 --> 01:03:26.598
It has a hot water heater,
safety glass, ventilated crank case.

01:03:26.698 --> 01:03:30.269
The best self-starter on the market.
Only 16,000 miles.

01:03:30.369 --> 01:03:33.147
A lot of pep and zing in this baby.

01:03:33.247 --> 01:03:35.357
I don't know... used car and all.

01:03:35.457 --> 01:03:39.403
Ah, but a used LaSalle, sir.
That's the big difference.

01:03:39.503 --> 01:03:41.488
I'll let you in on a little something.

01:03:41.588 --> 01:03:44.616
Belonged to a Cook County commissioner.

01:03:44.716 --> 01:03:47.911
And I don't have to tell you
how those boys take care of their cars.

01:03:48.011 --> 01:03:50.556
- How much?
- Eight hundred dollars.

01:03:51.890 --> 01:03:54.334
But for you, 750.

01:03:54.434 --> 01:03:57.504
Sold. Provided I can drive her
out of here right now.

01:03:57.604 --> 01:04:00.591
Don't see why not.
How'd you like to finance it?

01:04:00.691 --> 01:04:04.428
Oh, uh, cash on the line,
if that's okay.

01:04:04.528 --> 01:04:07.431
Yes, sir. Can't argue with cash.

01:04:07.531 --> 01:04:10.934
All I need is your name and address
for the bill of sale.

01:04:11.034 --> 01:04:14.271
Oh, yeah. Uh, James Morton.

01:04:14.371 --> 01:04:17.441
212 Hubbard Street...

01:04:17.541 --> 01:04:20.110
Los Angeles, California.

01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:23.655
- Four months in advance.
- Yes, sir. You betcha.

01:04:23.755 --> 01:04:26.784
- I'll get you a receipt for this, Mr....
- Uh, James Morton.

01:04:26.884 --> 01:04:29.553
I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Morton.

01:04:55.746 --> 01:04:57.815
On the evening of February 11...

01:04:57.915 --> 01:05:00.901
Angelo Molina,
a second cousin of Joe Aiello's...

01:05:01.001 --> 01:05:03.445
buys a train ticket to Los Angeles.

01:05:03.545 --> 01:05:05.739
Aware that Al Capone
has discovered his part...

01:05:05.839 --> 01:05:07.741
in the murder of Patsy Lolordo...

01:05:07.841 --> 01:05:11.161
Aiello will use the ticket
to board the train at the last minute...

01:05:11.261 --> 01:05:14.056
in an effort to escape
the vengeance of Capone.

01:05:18.227 --> 01:05:20.462
Who says people are getting fed up?

01:05:20.562 --> 01:05:23.340
The papers? These guys on the radio?

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.359
What do they know?

01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:32.574
Think most guys give a damn
who gets bumped off long as it ain't them?

01:05:35.452 --> 01:05:38.814
Listen, I know people.
I make it my business to know people.

01:05:38.914 --> 01:05:41.358
They get a big kick
reading in the paper...

01:05:41.458 --> 01:05:44.361
where some poor stiff
gets taken for a ride.

01:05:44.461 --> 01:05:46.905
Hello?

01:05:47.005 --> 01:05:49.675
Yeah, Frank?

01:05:51.301 --> 01:05:54.596
Wait for me... at the barbershop.

01:05:56.807 --> 01:05:59.334
Come on, kid.

01:05:59.434 --> 01:06:01.562
Stick around, guys.

01:06:11.655 --> 01:06:14.199
I gotta go pay a bill.

01:06:19.246 --> 01:06:21.165
Board!

01:07:31.527 --> 01:07:34.304
- Who's there?
- Tickets.

01:07:34.404 --> 01:07:36.323
Just a minute.

01:07:58.512 --> 01:08:00.806
Signor Capone...

01:08:04.601 --> 01:08:06.670
Basta!

01:08:06.770 --> 01:08:09.398
Assassino!

01:08:45.142 --> 01:08:47.560
Giuseppe Aiello.

01:09:28.685 --> 01:09:31.255
Mrs. Doody? My friend here and me...

01:09:31.354 --> 01:09:34.425
we're looking for a nice front room,
and your sign out there...

01:09:34.524 --> 01:09:37.594
Come on in. I can't afford
to heat up the whole street.

01:09:37.694 --> 01:09:40.430
- The way they charge for coal nowadays...
- Yeah.

01:09:40.531 --> 01:09:42.850
- You in a band or something?
- With an orchestra.

01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:45.477
One of the cabarets over on Fullerton.

01:09:45.577 --> 01:09:48.814
- The rooms are upstairs.
- Okay.

01:09:48.913 --> 01:09:52.151
Oh, this is a charming
place you have here, Mrs. Doody.

01:09:52.251 --> 01:09:54.653
I don't want no horn-tootin' in here.

01:09:54.753 --> 01:09:57.281
My roomers wouldn't stand
for nothing like that.

01:09:57.381 --> 01:09:59.450
Don't you worry about that, ma'am.

01:09:59.550 --> 01:10:02.970
We only play these things
when we get paid for it.

01:10:05.806 --> 01:10:08.125
Do you want two singles
or just the double?

01:10:08.225 --> 01:10:10.477
One room's enough,
as long as it's a front.

01:10:11.728 --> 01:10:13.630
If you're gonna be sleeping days...

01:10:13.730 --> 01:10:15.632
I'd advise you to take a back room.

01:10:15.732 --> 01:10:19.053
The noise on Clark Street isn't to be
believed, what with the buses and the people

01:10:19.153 --> 01:10:21.055
I said a front room, okay?

01:10:21.155 --> 01:10:23.140
You see, we're out here
from New York, ma'am.

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:27.102
Gets too quiet, we can't go to sleep.
Bet you're the same way.

01:10:27.202 --> 01:10:29.496
I'll show you what I got.

01:10:47.097 --> 01:10:50.000
Oh, it's a nice room, Mrs. Doody.

01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:52.002
We'll take it.

01:10:52.102 --> 01:10:54.338
You get a change of linen twice a week.

01:10:54.438 --> 01:10:57.549
Bathroom's at the end of the hall.
No visitors after 11:00.

01:10:57.649 --> 01:11:00.010
And I don't want no women up here!

01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:02.012
I run a respectable place...

01:11:02.112 --> 01:11:04.014
Well, don't you worry about that, ma'am.

01:11:04.114 --> 01:11:07.851
We'll move our stuff in tomorrow.
How much do we owe you?

01:11:07.951 --> 01:11:11.371
Comes to nine dollars a week.
In advance.

01:11:13.123 --> 01:11:16.585
Your receipt and an extra key
will be on the hall table.

01:11:18.504 --> 01:11:20.406
What's your name?

01:11:20.506 --> 01:11:23.300
He's Mr. White, and I'm Mr. Johnson.

01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:28.747
Hey, lady. What about a phone?

01:11:28.847 --> 01:11:31.892
Pay phone at the end of the hall.

01:11:34.645 --> 01:11:36.630
You'd better give Vic a call.

01:11:36.730 --> 01:11:38.649
Right.

01:11:49.284 --> 01:11:52.079
Long Beach 6599.

01:11:57.251 --> 01:12:00.029
Filling station. O'Meara talking.

01:12:00.129 --> 01:12:02.047
Yeah, hold on.

01:12:14.518 --> 01:12:16.478
Phone.

01:12:21.525 --> 01:12:23.485
Hello?

01:12:24.862 --> 01:12:27.097
He just stepped out. Any message?

01:12:27.197 --> 01:12:30.100
- I'll call him back.
- Okay.

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:33.787
- Who just stepped out?
- Wrong number.

01:12:35.539 --> 01:12:37.775
Okay?

01:12:37.875 --> 01:12:39.793
Okay.

01:13:16.747 --> 01:13:19.316
Out for some fun tonight, eh, boys?

01:13:19.416 --> 01:13:21.443
Well, you've come to the right place.

01:13:21.543 --> 01:13:23.445
I've been here before, you know?

01:13:23.545 --> 01:13:27.341
Thought I recognized you.
That'll be two dollars... apiece.

01:13:46.318 --> 01:13:51.014
All right. The car is in a garage
behind 1723 Wood Street.

01:13:51.114 --> 01:13:53.016
Right here.

01:13:53.116 --> 01:13:55.769
Opens onto an alley
running north and south.

01:13:55.869 --> 01:13:58.647
Take the alley to Bloomingdale
and jog left to Wood.

01:13:58.747 --> 01:14:00.649
East on Webster to Clark...

01:14:00.749 --> 01:14:02.776
south on Clark Street
about half a block...

01:14:02.876 --> 01:14:05.029
and there she is.

01:14:05.129 --> 01:14:07.322
Since you boys come from out of town...

01:14:07.422 --> 01:14:10.200
nobody in the place
is gonna recognize you.

01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:12.761
All you got to do is act like cops.

01:14:19.935 --> 01:14:22.880
Huh. Must be yours.

01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:24.882
That's Moran.

01:14:24.982 --> 01:14:27.926
Probably won't be able to see
his face from across the street...

01:14:28.026 --> 01:14:30.929
but none of his boys are built
like him, so that's no problem.

01:14:31.029 --> 01:14:35.517
He wears brown clothes a lot...
suit, overcoat, hat, shoes.

01:14:35.617 --> 01:14:37.519
Albert Anselmi...

01:14:37.619 --> 01:14:40.230
born Marsala, Sicily, June 11, 1892.

01:14:40.330 --> 01:14:43.275
He is a member of the Mafia
and a professional assassin...

01:14:43.375 --> 01:14:46.570
as is John Scalise,
born Castelvetrano, Sicily...

01:14:46.670 --> 01:14:49.406
January 24, 1895.

01:14:49.506 --> 01:14:51.575
In a period of less than six years...

01:14:51.675 --> 01:14:55.412
these two men, acting together,
have participated in 31 murders...

01:14:55.512 --> 01:14:59.249
including those of Dion O'Bannion
and Earl "Hymie" Weiss.

01:14:59.349 --> 01:15:02.836
There's always the outside chance
you'll be spotted by a legit squad car.

01:15:02.936 --> 01:15:06.715
If it happens before you get there
and they try to stop you, okay.

01:15:06.815 --> 01:15:09.635
That's a rap the lawyers can beat.

01:15:09.735 --> 01:15:11.762
If it happens after you leave...

01:15:11.862 --> 01:15:14.264
you might as well start blasting.

01:15:14.364 --> 01:15:16.742
You got nothing to lose.

01:15:19.119 --> 01:15:21.121
Any questions?

01:15:22.539 --> 01:15:24.500
That's it.

01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:51.802
Hello?

01:15:51.902 --> 01:15:54.471
Jack, great to hear from you, kid.

01:15:54.571 --> 01:15:56.473
How's the weather back there?

01:15:56.573 --> 01:15:58.475
Right around zero, Mr. Capone.

01:15:58.575 --> 01:16:01.311
Sure could use some of that
Miami sunshine up here.

01:16:01.411 --> 01:16:04.022
Yeah, I'll bet you could!

01:16:04.122 --> 01:16:06.567
Anything special you want
to tell me, kid?

01:16:06.667 --> 01:16:10.362
Yes, sir. It's all set
for this Thursday, Mr. Capone.

01:16:10.462 --> 01:16:13.323
In the morning. Around 10:30.

01:16:13.423 --> 01:16:15.701
We got a nice valentine
all ready to deliver.

01:16:15.801 --> 01:16:20.164
Valentine? Hey, that's right.

01:16:20.264 --> 01:16:22.624
This Thursday's Valentine's Day.

01:16:22.724 --> 01:16:26.837
Ain't that a hot one?
A valentine for Bugs!

01:16:26.937 --> 01:16:32.359
Say, Jack, just make sure
it's a great big red valentine, huh?

01:16:36.446 --> 01:16:39.183
At 6:45 on the last
morning of his life...

01:16:39.283 --> 01:16:42.269
John May takes an early bus to work.

01:16:42.369 --> 01:16:45.522
He has been promised a 10-dollar bonus
if he can replace the transmission...

01:16:45.622 --> 01:16:48.584
of one of the gang's cars before noon.

01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:03.374
At 7:02 on the
last morning of his life...

01:17:03.474 --> 01:17:05.709
Pete Gusenberg is considering ways...

01:17:05.809 --> 01:17:07.920
to rid himself of Myrtle Koppleman.

01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:10.355
There are plenty more
where she came from.

01:17:26.538 --> 01:17:29.483
At 7:23 on the
last morning of his life...

01:17:29.583 --> 01:17:32.069
Albert Kachellek, alias James Clark...

01:17:32.169 --> 01:17:34.279
is thinking of buying a new car.

01:17:34.379 --> 01:17:37.341
His status in the gang
demands better than this.

01:17:44.807 --> 01:17:48.585
Ah. You should've woke me, Ma.
I'd have had breakfast with you.

01:17:48.685 --> 01:17:52.089
How do you expect me to
know you were even home...

01:17:52.189 --> 01:17:54.800
coming in at all hours?

01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:57.344
You said you would be here for supper.

01:17:57.444 --> 01:18:00.639
I'm sorry, Ma.
I ran into a couple of friends.

01:18:00.739 --> 01:18:02.641
I might have guessed.

01:18:02.741 --> 01:18:07.104
Where those friends of yours
are concerned, you don't have a mother.

01:18:07.204 --> 01:18:09.690
At 7:30 on the
last morning of his life...

01:18:09.790 --> 01:18:12.776
Reinhart Schwimmer
is in desperate need of money.

01:18:12.876 --> 01:18:15.821
I have to talk to you, Mama.
It's important.

01:18:15.921 --> 01:18:19.283
Listen, Mama, I hate to tell you this,
but... I'm in trouble.

01:18:19.383 --> 01:18:21.160
Not with the police, Reinhart.

01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:23.412
Nothing like that. I owe some money.

01:18:23.512 --> 01:18:27.182
Three hundred dollars. It's gotta
be paid quick, or I'm in a real jam.

01:18:29.268 --> 01:18:33.480
A man with a fine profession
doing such things.

01:18:35.399 --> 01:18:37.301
All right.

01:18:37.401 --> 01:18:40.637
If you promise to stay
away from those gangsters...

01:18:40.737 --> 01:18:42.639
I'll get you the money.

01:18:42.739 --> 01:18:45.909
I will. I give you my word.

01:18:48.537 --> 01:18:51.940
Just be a good boy, Reinhart.

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:54.710
That isn't so much to ask.

01:18:59.381 --> 01:19:01.633
Hello?

01:19:06.013 --> 01:19:07.915
Um, what do you want?

01:19:08.015 --> 01:19:10.542
What?

01:19:10.642 --> 01:19:12.669
Hello? Eddie.

01:19:12.769 --> 01:19:15.172
Yeah, I'm up.

01:19:15.272 --> 01:19:18.901
Yeah, Eddie, I'm up.
I'm up, I'm up, I'm up.

01:19:29.786 --> 01:19:31.688
What's your hurry, honey?

01:19:31.788 --> 01:19:35.626
You think I like sitting around here
and listening to you snore?

01:19:38.378 --> 01:19:40.864
Stick around, hot stuff.

01:19:40.964 --> 01:19:44.510
We'll open a keg of nails.

01:20:23.924 --> 01:20:27.953
- You still here?
- Look, mister, you owe me $25!

01:20:28.053 --> 01:20:30.764
And I don't leave until I get it.

01:20:35.602 --> 01:20:38.338
You know, with a he-man
like me, you ought to pay.

01:20:38.438 --> 01:20:41.258
That'll be the day.

01:20:41.358 --> 01:20:45.220
Why, thanks, lover. See you around.

01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:48.057
At 7:41 on the
last morning of his life...

01:20:48.157 --> 01:20:52.119
Frank Gusenberg is wondering if he
shouldn't go back to one of his wives.

01:20:53.704 --> 01:20:56.039
Can I fix you some breakfast, dear?

01:21:05.674 --> 01:21:08.369
At 8:00 on the
last morning of his life...

01:21:08.469 --> 01:21:11.246
Adam Heyer is calculating
how much the cost...

01:21:11.346 --> 01:21:14.558
of an operation for his wife
will take from his savings.

01:21:31.658 --> 01:21:34.019
You will tell him, Bert.

01:21:34.119 --> 01:21:37.314
You won't back down. Promise me.

01:21:37.414 --> 01:21:39.858
Don't worry, honey. I'm through.

01:21:39.958 --> 01:21:41.860
I'll walk in and say, "So long, George.

01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:43.987
I won't be seeing you anymore,"
and walk out.

01:21:44.087 --> 01:21:45.989
Finished.

01:21:46.089 --> 01:21:48.050
Thank God.

01:21:52.346 --> 01:21:55.098
I'll call you after lunch, around 1:30.

01:21:56.517 --> 01:21:59.503
At 8:15 on the
last morning of his life...

01:21:59.603 --> 01:22:02.881
Albert Wienshank has decided
that his safety and his peace of mind...

01:22:02.981 --> 01:22:06.193
are more important than $20,000 a year.

01:22:50.028 --> 01:22:53.182
Listen to this. Only 600 bucks.

01:22:53.282 --> 01:22:56.185
"Four-cylinder floating power.

01:22:56.285 --> 01:22:58.896
"Freedom from vibration and rumble...

01:22:58.996 --> 01:23:01.857
"that makes driving a constant delight.

01:23:01.957 --> 01:23:04.168
- Increased speed and..."
- Alex.

01:23:08.046 --> 01:23:11.909
- Moran?
- Nah, he's too short.

01:23:12.009 --> 01:23:15.579
You know something, Paul?
That's the sixth guy in there already.

01:23:15.679 --> 01:23:18.624
Nobody told us we got to keep score.

01:23:18.724 --> 01:23:21.168
All we're supposed to do
is count up to one.

01:23:21.268 --> 01:23:23.187
Morning, boys.

01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:28.592
If it ain't good old Reiny.
How's the eye business, Doc?

01:23:28.692 --> 01:23:31.303
Haven't you heard? I, uh, retired.

01:23:31.403 --> 01:23:33.931
Living on my investments.

01:23:34.031 --> 01:23:37.351
He means his old lady
is paying the bills.

01:23:37.451 --> 01:23:39.395
Saw Pete's car out front.

01:23:39.495 --> 01:23:43.165
I thought I'd drop in, say hello,
get a cup of coffee.

01:23:44.917 --> 01:23:46.944
Would you mind helping yourself, Doc?

01:23:47.044 --> 01:23:49.196
The waiter just left.

01:23:49.296 --> 01:23:51.215
Sure.

01:24:05.979 --> 01:24:08.298
How's it going, Pete?

01:24:08.398 --> 01:24:10.359
Okay.

01:24:12.986 --> 01:24:15.973
Say, a fella over at the barbershop...

01:24:16.073 --> 01:24:18.976
gave me a tip on a filly from Miami.

01:24:19.076 --> 01:24:21.270
Indian Broom.

01:24:21.370 --> 01:24:23.272
Long shot.

01:24:23.372 --> 01:24:25.374
Claims it's in the bag.

01:24:28.252 --> 01:24:31.363
I'll make my own mistakes. Okay by you?

01:24:31.463 --> 01:24:33.365
Sure, Pete, sure.

01:24:33.465 --> 01:24:35.868
Just thought I'd pass it along
for what it's worth.

01:24:35.968 --> 01:24:37.928
You know?

01:24:43.308 --> 01:24:45.627
- How's the weather out?
- Still coming down.

01:24:45.727 --> 01:24:48.547
Winds like a handful of razor blades.

01:24:48.647 --> 01:24:51.300
- You guys are getting soft.
- Mr. Miller?

01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:54.486
It's a Mr. Bernstein,
long distance from Detroit.

01:25:03.579 --> 01:25:06.690
Yeah, Abe. George. What's so important?

01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:10.194
What's keeping the guy?

01:25:10.294 --> 01:25:12.212
Bingo!

01:25:14.381 --> 01:25:16.784
Right height, right build,
even the right clothes.

01:25:16.884 --> 01:25:18.911
That's our baby.
I can let him have it right now.

01:25:19.011 --> 01:25:22.539
Ixnay, pal. We'll let him have it...
if he comes out the door.

01:25:22.639 --> 01:25:25.392
Go call Vic. Go on.

01:25:32.316 --> 01:25:36.278
Operator? Hey, get me Long Beach 6...

01:25:39.072 --> 01:25:42.493
Long Beach 6599. Right, right.

01:25:45.662 --> 01:25:48.440
- Yeah, hello?
- Mr. King?

01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:50.734
He just stepped out. Any message?

01:25:50.834 --> 01:25:54.071
Yeah. Tell him his shirts is ready.

01:25:54.171 --> 01:25:56.089
Okay.

01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:18.929
Hey, what's that all about?

01:26:19.029 --> 01:26:20.931
Garlic.

01:26:21.031 --> 01:26:24.159
In case the bullets don't kill you,
you die of the blood poisoning.

01:26:58.443 --> 01:27:01.388
I told him the next time he tries
to jack up the price at the last minute...

01:27:01.488 --> 01:27:03.849
I'd find somebody else
up there to do business with.

01:27:03.949 --> 01:27:06.118
I oughta stick a pineapple in his hat.

01:27:13.292 --> 01:27:15.194
Lousy cops.

01:27:15.294 --> 01:27:17.946
They sure picked
a swell time to get nosy.

01:27:18.046 --> 01:27:21.950
Hell of a rut if Sorello shows up
with the booze with them still in there.

01:27:22.050 --> 01:27:25.596
- Let's get a cup of coffee.
- Yeah, I could use one.

01:27:27.931 --> 01:27:30.793
Okay, Mike. Quiet, Trench.

01:27:30.893 --> 01:27:33.061
George, is that you?

01:27:35.272 --> 01:27:37.925
Hello, boys. Something I can do for you?

01:27:38.025 --> 01:27:39.927
Yeah, you can shut up.

01:27:40.027 --> 01:27:42.429
Now line up, all of you. Face that wall.

01:27:42.529 --> 01:27:44.640
You, over there! Come on, move!

01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:47.518
- Now, wait.
- Let's go.

01:27:47.618 --> 01:27:50.854
You. All right, you two, let's go.

01:27:50.954 --> 01:27:53.982
Listen, buster, you better be kidding.

01:27:54.082 --> 01:27:56.001
Move.

01:27:58.086 --> 01:28:00.364
Lousy flatfeet.

01:28:00.464 --> 01:28:02.908
Wait till they hear about this downtown.

01:28:03.008 --> 01:28:05.285
Move!

01:28:05.385 --> 01:28:08.222
Hey! You!

01:28:09.681 --> 01:28:12.710
You on the car! Let's go! Let's go!

01:28:12.810 --> 01:28:15.524
- Sir, I'm just a mechanic here.
- Let's go.

01:28:15.624 --> 01:28:19.984
All I do is work on the automobiles. I don't
have anything to do with these people.

01:28:20.084 --> 01:28:21.439
Come on. Move!

01:28:21.539 --> 01:28:25.001
 Hands on the wall! Lean on it!

01:30:26.443 --> 01:30:29.722
Lot of guys tell me,
"Get into the stock market, George.

01:30:29.822 --> 01:30:33.726
Pull up a few grand.
Inside a year, you'll be a rich man."

01:30:33.826 --> 01:30:36.645
I say, "What the hell?
I'm already a rich man."

01:30:36.745 --> 01:30:39.706
Besides, I...

01:30:43.794 --> 01:30:45.696
- Must have been a bad accident.
- Yeah.

01:30:45.796 --> 01:30:49.074
- The way people drive today, you're lucky...
- Kenny!

01:30:49.174 --> 01:30:52.870
Hey, Kenny, the cops just killed a bunch
of hoods in the garage up the street!

01:30:52.970 --> 01:30:56.014
One of them was Bugs Moran!

01:31:06.108 --> 01:31:08.026
Frank?

01:31:09.862 --> 01:31:12.431
Can you hear me, Frank?

01:31:12.531 --> 01:31:14.992
Who shot you, Frank?

01:31:16.743 --> 01:31:19.204
Who did it? Who shot you?

01:31:22.166 --> 01:31:24.585
Nobody.

01:31:27.838 --> 01:31:30.074
Nobody shot me.

01:31:30.174 --> 01:31:33.077
Your brother's dead.

01:31:33.177 --> 01:31:36.597
They're all dead. Come on, who did it?

01:31:45.939 --> 01:31:50.094
I've got to tell you, Frank.
You're not going to make it.

01:31:50.194 --> 01:31:52.262
You want me to get a preacher?

01:31:52.362 --> 01:31:55.265
No.

01:31:55.365 --> 01:31:57.684
Just leave me alone.

01:31:57.784 --> 01:32:00.829
You don't want to let them
get away with this. Come on, help us.

01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:05.667
It's cold.

01:32:07.252 --> 01:32:09.505
It's awful cold.

01:32:12.883 --> 01:32:15.302
Fix this thing, will you?

01:32:22.059 --> 01:32:25.504
A few hours after the
St. Valentine's Day Massacre...

01:32:25.604 --> 01:32:28.132
the newspapers manage to locate Moran...

01:32:28.232 --> 01:32:30.843
something the police
have not yet been able to do.

01:32:30.943 --> 01:32:35.180
Just a heavy cold. I thought
I'd better take care of it.

01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:37.224
Where were you, Mr. Moran,
when it happened?

01:32:37.324 --> 01:32:39.518
I... Out of town.

01:32:39.618 --> 01:32:42.020
How long do you expect to be laid up?

01:32:42.120 --> 01:32:44.940
Well, I can't say for sure.

01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:48.694
Uh, maybe a day or two.

01:32:48.794 --> 01:32:52.531
Did you know the cops
are looking for you, Moran?

01:32:52.631 --> 01:32:56.702
I can't imagine why.
Nothing I can tell them.

01:32:56.802 --> 01:32:59.663
This gonna put you out of business?

01:32:59.763 --> 01:33:02.332
You must be a little mixed up, buddy.

01:33:02.432 --> 01:33:05.586
I happen to be in
the real estate business.

01:33:05.686 --> 01:33:09.506
Oh, yeah, I knew some of those fellas...

01:33:09.606 --> 01:33:12.384
just to talk to, you know?

01:33:12.484 --> 01:33:15.487
I even read where it said
they were working for me.

01:33:17.573 --> 01:33:21.602
You can't believe everything
you read in the newspapers.

01:33:21.702 --> 01:33:24.313
Mr. Moran, there are
a lot of people around town...

01:33:24.413 --> 01:33:28.150
who are saying it was actually the police
who killed your... those seven men.

01:33:28.250 --> 01:33:30.986
Do you think it's possible?

01:33:31.086 --> 01:33:34.156
You must be new around here, mister.

01:33:34.256 --> 01:33:37.426
Only Al Capone kills like that.

01:33:39.803 --> 01:33:42.373
Well, make yourselves a drink.

01:33:42.473 --> 01:33:47.336
Hey, you know, I'm always glad
to have you people drop around.

01:33:47.436 --> 01:33:51.548
But believe me, this is one time
I'd like to know the answers.

01:33:51.648 --> 01:33:55.344
Mr. Capone, I wonder if you saw those awful
pictures of those men in the newspapers.

01:33:55.444 --> 01:33:59.556
I glanced at 'em.

01:33:59.656 --> 01:34:01.158
Terrible.

01:34:05.078 --> 01:34:07.773
If you don't mind telling us,
Mr. Capone...

01:34:07.873 --> 01:34:09.775
where were you when it happened?

01:34:09.875 --> 01:34:12.277
Why, right here in Miami.
In fact, I was in a meeting...

01:34:12.377 --> 01:34:16.073
with your district attorney
that same morning.

01:34:16.173 --> 01:34:18.467
Do you know this
Mr. George Moran personally?

01:34:20.886 --> 01:34:23.831
I met him... once. A few years back.

01:34:23.931 --> 01:34:25.916
I doubt if I'd recognize
him on the street.

01:34:26.016 --> 01:34:31.088
The Chicago authorities insist
you were behind the, uh, massacre.

01:34:31.188 --> 01:34:33.649
Any comment on that, Mr. Capone?

01:34:35.734 --> 01:34:37.845
Well, I'm not surprised.

01:34:37.945 --> 01:34:41.765
They've blamed everything on me
since the Chicago Fire.

01:34:41.865 --> 01:34:44.643
Did you hear what Bugs Moran
told the Chicago papers?

01:34:44.743 --> 01:34:48.772
He said,
"Only Al Capone kills like that."

01:34:48.872 --> 01:34:51.191
Yeah?

01:34:51.291 --> 01:34:54.319
Well, I'll tell you what Al Capone says!

01:34:54.419 --> 01:34:56.380
And you can quote me.

01:34:58.507 --> 01:35:01.844
They don't call that guy
"Bugs" for nothing.

01:35:07.224 --> 01:35:10.586
Public indignation
at the St. Valentine's Day Massacre...

01:35:10.686 --> 01:35:13.422
brings to a halt
the most notorious era...

01:35:13.522 --> 01:35:16.300
of open gang warfare
in American history.

01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:20.345
Later in the century, the gangs
will rebuild so that by the 1960s...

01:35:20.445 --> 01:35:23.724
their power will be
far above that of the '20s.

01:35:23.824 --> 01:35:25.976
Once more, law enforcement agencies...

01:35:26.076 --> 01:35:28.812
will be aware of the names
of the syndicate leaders...

01:35:28.912 --> 01:35:31.440
and once more
they will not prosecute them...

01:35:31.540 --> 01:35:34.318
awaiting perhaps the moment
when the public will demand...

01:35:34.418 --> 01:35:36.320
as it did in 1929...

01:35:36.420 --> 01:35:39.323
that the criminals be brought to justice.

01:35:39.423 --> 01:35:43.535
No one is ever brought to trial for the
slaughter of the seven men in this garage...

01:35:43.635 --> 01:35:48.499
but within 19 months, all four of the killers
will themselves die of violence.

01:35:48.599 --> 01:35:52.211
On the evening of May 7, 1929...

01:35:52.311 --> 01:35:54.505
John Scalise and Albert Anselmi...

01:35:54.605 --> 01:35:57.591
are invited to a banquet
at the mansion of Al Capone...

01:35:57.691 --> 01:36:00.386
unaware that he has discovered
their plot to murder him...

01:36:00.486 --> 01:36:02.529
and take over his empire.

01:36:06.241 --> 01:36:08.535
Yeah.

01:36:14.708 --> 01:36:17.486
I want to make a toast.

01:36:17.586 --> 01:36:19.530
To my good friends...

01:36:19.630 --> 01:36:21.657
Giovanni Scalise...

01:36:21.757 --> 01:36:24.201
and Alberto Anselmi.

01:36:24.301 --> 01:36:26.203
Salute.

01:36:26.303 --> 01:36:28.222
May you rot in hell!

01:37:17.354 --> 01:37:19.465
Of the two supposed police officers...

01:37:19.565 --> 01:37:21.467
involved in the massacre...

01:37:21.567 --> 01:37:24.845
Boris Chapman is shot to death
on January 5, 1930...

01:37:24.945 --> 01:37:27.681
while attempting to rob
a St. Louis jewelry store.

01:37:27.781 --> 01:37:30.476
The body of Adolph Moeller
is found in a pond...

01:37:30.576 --> 01:37:32.853
12 miles south of Joplin, Missouri...

01:37:32.953 --> 01:37:35.330
on September 8, 1930.

01:37:39.710 --> 01:37:42.780
Vincenzo DeMora, alias
"Machine Gun" Jack McGurn...

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:46.825
is murdered in a Chicago
bowling alley on February 15, 1936...

01:37:46.925 --> 01:37:48.827
almost exactly seven years...

01:37:48.927 --> 01:37:52.639
after the St. Valentine's Day
Massacre he masterminded.

01:37:58.228 --> 01:38:01.048
George Clarence Moran
disappears from Chicago...

01:38:01.148 --> 01:38:03.926
soon after the mass murder
of his followers.

01:38:04.026 --> 01:38:06.595
While serving a 10-year
sentence for bank robbery...

01:38:06.695 --> 01:38:09.264
in the federal penitentiary
in Leavenworth, Kansas...

01:38:09.364 --> 01:38:13.869
he dies of lung cancer
on February 25, 1957.

01:38:15.287 --> 01:38:18.690
Alphonse Capone, while he
is never tried for complicity...

01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:21.276
in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre...

01:38:21.376 --> 01:38:24.363
his role as the man behind it
goes unquestioned.

01:38:24.463 --> 01:38:26.365
Three months later, he is in prison...

01:38:26.465 --> 01:38:29.368
and more than half
of the remaining 18 years of his life...

01:38:29.468 --> 01:38:32.121
are spent in federal penitentiaries.

01:38:32.221 --> 01:38:35.207
On January 25, 1947...

01:38:35.307 --> 01:38:37.334
Alphonse Capone, his mind gone...

01:38:37.434 --> 01:38:40.713
his body ravaged by syphilis,
dies in his sleep.

01:38:40.813 --> 01:38:45.818
On February 4, his body is interred
in the family plot in a Chicago cemetery.
