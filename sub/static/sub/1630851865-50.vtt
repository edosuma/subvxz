Moon! Hey, Moon!

00:34.559 --> 00:37.199
-Hey, Ollie! S'up?
-My Auntie Char did it!

00:37.320 --> 00:41.400
[gasps] She went around
the whole world on her bicycle!

00:41.720 --> 00:43.680
Whee!

00:44.559 --> 00:46.400
So you know what <i>we </i>should do?

00:46.559 --> 00:49.080
Go on our own around-the-world trip!

00:49.280 --> 00:52.080
But not on a bike. On a tuk tuk!

00:52.919 --> 00:55.400
Actually, I was thinking
we could celebrate.

00:55.519 --> 00:57.919
We can throw my Auntie Char
a welcome-home party,

00:58.080 --> 01:02.559
-here in New York!
-Did someone say party?

01:02.720 --> 01:05.080
Yeah! Let's start brainstorming!

01:05.239 --> 01:08.399
No need for that. I know exactly
what Auntie Char will want.

01:08.520 --> 01:12.000
A piece of New York cheesecake
from Chuck's Cake Truck.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.560
It's her favourite!
So let's go get some

01:14.720 --> 01:17.640
and meet her at our special
picnic spot in Central Park.

01:17.759 --> 01:19.720
-So just a cake, then?
-Uh-huh.

01:19.840 --> 01:20.840
-Nothing else?
-Nope.

01:20.960 --> 01:22.640
Really just a cake
and nothing else?

01:22.839 --> 01:25.160
-That's right!
-But, Ollie,

01:25.320 --> 01:27.160
a party needs more than a cake!

01:27.320 --> 01:30.600
It needs guests, to eat it,
and music, and confetti!

01:30.720 --> 01:32.080
[vacuum cleaner]

01:32.280 --> 01:37.000
Well, sure, if we had a week
to ten days to plan it maybe.

01:37.119 --> 01:40.440
My friend Randy could help us
whip up a party super fast!

01:40.600 --> 01:42.520
It's his job! How about I call

01:42.720 --> 01:44.679
and ask him
to meet us at the truck?

01:44.839 --> 01:47.199
Hmm... Well...

01:47.360 --> 01:50.240
As long as he keeps things
really small and quiet.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.160
Great! I'm ready to party!

01:53.320 --> 01:54.440
Ahem!

01:54.720 --> 01:58.720
I mean, I am ready
to eat some cake. Quietly.

01:58.880 --> 02:01.119
Then let's go find that cake truck!

02:04.839 --> 02:06.880
So, according to my app,

02:07.039 --> 02:11.239
the cake truck is supposed to
stop near the Brooklyn Bridge.

02:11.400 --> 02:14.280
That's a quick trip!
Right, Moon?

02:15.519 --> 02:17.000
Why are you dressed like that?

02:17.160 --> 02:19.040
Well, it's a party, isn't it?

02:19.200 --> 02:21.239
I thought I'd wear something elegant!

02:21.880 --> 02:22.720
Whoa!

02:23.799 --> 02:25.799
As long as you can keep up!

02:26.320 --> 02:28.239
Psst.
Can you hold this, Stanley?

02:28.359 --> 02:32.000
Ollie's a simple cat.
He doesn't think big, like I do!

02:32.200 --> 02:33.880
But I'm sure
he'll want to wear it later.

02:34.040 --> 02:37.320
Good thinking, Moon!
I'll put it in my hat closet.

02:37.480 --> 02:40.959
Let's go! We have to hurry
before Auntie Char gets home!

02:41.640 --> 02:43.079
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

02:43.239 --> 02:44.920
<i>we have reached our cruising altitude</i>

02:45.120 --> 02:49.079
<i>on our way to New York City.</i>
<i>Yay!</i>

02:50.880 --> 02:54.720
According to my app, it should
take us seven minutes to...

02:54.840 --> 02:56.320
-Moon!
-See you there!

02:56.480 --> 02:58.280
Great party coming up!
Hope you can make it!

02:58.440 --> 03:01.920
-Invitations!
-Moon! What are these?

03:02.079 --> 03:05.480
Invitations! Auntie Char
is a great explorer.

03:05.640 --> 03:08.920
Don't you think people will love
hearing about her adventures?

03:09.120 --> 03:11.959
-Well, sure, but we...
-Don't worry, Ollie!

03:12.120 --> 03:14.760
It's not like we're going
to invite the whole city!

03:14.920 --> 03:16.480
[gasps]

03:18.239 --> 03:19.640
Yep, we invited the whole city.

03:19.799 --> 03:22.799
Not the whole city.
That guy didn't get one.

03:22.959 --> 03:25.000
A party?
Can I bring my cousins?

03:25.160 --> 03:27.359
-Sure!
-Ha, ha, ha, ha!

03:27.480 --> 03:29.079
Moon!

03:29.239 --> 03:32.040
This is supposed to be a small
party, for friends and family.

03:32.239 --> 03:36.959
Right. Sorry. I always
get carried away with parties.

03:37.079 --> 03:38.679
It's OK.

03:38.840 --> 03:41.760
There's no party!
It's all a big mistake!

03:41.920 --> 03:45.440
But let's concentrate on getting
to the cake truck, all right?

03:48.200 --> 03:49.920
The truck should be here any minute.

03:50.040 --> 03:52.920
I can already picture
the smile on Auntie Char's face

03:53.079 --> 03:55.399
when she tastes
her favourite cake!

03:56.239 --> 04:01.600
-And looks like Randy found us!
-Hi! Stanley! You party animal!

04:01.760 --> 04:03.959
[special greeting noises]

04:04.119 --> 04:05.720
[laughter]

04:05.880 --> 04:08.359
These are my friends
Ollie and Moon.

04:08.519 --> 04:10.359
Actually, my pal Ollie here

04:10.519 --> 04:13.119
is throwing a <i>big </i>welcome-home
party for his Auntie and...

04:13.280 --> 04:17.880
Small! A small welcome-home
party for his Auntie.

04:18.039 --> 04:22.039
Just a few decorations.
Small and quiet, OK?

04:22.159 --> 04:25.400
You got it!
The customer is always right.

04:25.520 --> 04:27.520
Now, what are we thinking, folks?

04:27.880 --> 04:33.240
I was thinking small and quiet,
but maybe with a Mariachi band?

04:33.360 --> 04:36.800
Big or small, a party
isn't a party without one!

04:36.960 --> 04:39.800
-Wow! Is that a bouncy castle?
-You know it!

04:39.919 --> 04:41.719
-It's not too big.
-Oh, no!

04:41.919 --> 04:43.360
And we can bounce quietly,
right?

04:43.520 --> 04:44.719
Of course!

04:44.919 --> 04:47.680
Actually,
I like everything on this page!

04:47.800 --> 04:48.840
-Fireworks!
-Yes!

04:48.960 --> 04:50.320
-Glitter cannons!
-Yes!

04:50.440 --> 04:51.560
Glow sticks!

04:53.599 --> 04:58.240
And what about you? You should
be as fabulous as your party!

04:58.400 --> 04:59.880
[gasps] Thank you!

05:00.039 --> 05:02.960
With an order of this size,
I'll throw it in for free!

05:03.120 --> 05:04.520
What a deal!

05:04.719 --> 05:08.159
See you at the park
for the party of the century!

05:08.440 --> 05:10.520
You think Ollie's going to be
OK with all this?

05:10.640 --> 05:11.880
Don't worry, Stanley.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.320
Once he sees how amazing this
party is, he'll change his mind.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.000
I just know it!

05:17.159 --> 05:19.760
Guys, here comes the food truck!

05:19.880 --> 05:22.000
Right on time!

05:22.159 --> 05:24.000
Excuse me, I'm lost.

05:24.159 --> 05:28.840
Wow! Are you movie star
Lady MeowMeow?

05:29.039 --> 05:31.159
-[giggles] Scoot?
-Hi, Scoot!

05:31.320 --> 05:35.880
Hi, Ollie! Oh, ma'am,
could I have your autograph?

05:36.039 --> 05:39.039
Scoot, it's me! Moon!

05:39.240 --> 05:41.880
I'm just all dressed up
for Ollie's amazing party!

05:42.560 --> 05:45.599
Moon? Ha!
Well, what do you know?

05:45.719 --> 05:49.719
I thought you were
movie star Lady MeowMeow!

05:49.880 --> 05:51.280
[crowd gasps]

05:51.440 --> 05:53.880
Uh-oh! I'll be in my safe room!

05:55.640 --> 05:57.599
No! The truck's leaving!

05:58.280 --> 05:59.280
Ruuuuun!

05:59.800 --> 06:02.960
Come to the party, Scoot!
It's in the paaaark!

06:03.120 --> 06:06.159
[all] Party in the park? Let's all go!

06:08.680 --> 06:10.560
We missed the truck

06:10.680 --> 06:12.680
and the cake for Auntie Char!

06:14.159 --> 06:15.960
And she says she'll be here soon!

06:16.120 --> 06:18.760
Ugh! It was my party outfit
that did it.

06:18.960 --> 06:22.120
Who knew I looked so much
like movie star Lady MeowMeow?

06:22.240 --> 06:25.680
I'm sorry, Ollie. If only
the truck made more stops.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.919
Wait. Maybe it does!

06:28.080 --> 06:31.440
Let's see...
One last stop today...

06:31.560 --> 06:33.200
[gasps] in Central Park!

06:33.359 --> 06:36.240
Perfect! Let me call Randy
and get rid of this outfit!

06:36.400 --> 06:39.479
Good idea, Moon.
Nothing, and I mean nothing,

06:39.640 --> 06:42.359
can get in our way this time!

06:42.520 --> 06:45.840
You need a fabulous
new party costume?

06:46.000 --> 06:49.560
You got it! How about a dragon?

06:49.719 --> 06:51.520
-Too heavy!
-Oh, of course, yes.

06:51.680 --> 06:53.400
A zebra?

06:53.560 --> 06:55.240
-Too itchy!
-Ah! You're right!

06:55.400 --> 06:56.960
Moon, we need to choose fast!

06:57.120 --> 06:59.599
Just put the next one on
and let's go!

06:59.719 --> 07:03.479
Perfect! Nobody will think
Moon's Lady MeowMeow in this.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.280
Thanks, Randy!

07:05.440 --> 07:06.359
See you at the party!

07:06.640 --> 07:08.560
What a great costume!

07:08.680 --> 07:10.200
It's going to be a hit
at the party.

07:10.520 --> 07:12.479
-Whoa!
-Don't you think, Ollie?

07:13.760 --> 07:16.680
Hi. Uh... Can I have a picture
with the mermaid?

07:16.799 --> 07:20.239
Aw. Isn't he cute, Ol?

07:20.400 --> 07:23.080
We have time for one picture,
right?

07:23.239 --> 07:25.120
One picture, then, on our way.

07:25.280 --> 07:26.479
Whoa!

07:26.640 --> 07:27.760
Say cheese!

07:27.880 --> 07:29.239
Cheese!

07:29.359 --> 07:33.640
Are you a mermaid princess?
Can I have a photo, too?

07:33.919 --> 07:36.400
Oh, Ollie.
We can't disappoint them.

07:36.680 --> 07:39.400
Look at their adorable
little faces!

07:39.599 --> 07:42.440
But, Moon,
look at my adorable little face.

07:43.320 --> 07:45.400
We can't disappoint my Auntie Char!

07:45.560 --> 07:46.680
We have to go now!

07:46.960 --> 07:48.599
You're leaving?

07:50.200 --> 07:53.039
The mermaid has a party
she has to go to now, kids!

07:53.200 --> 07:56.960
But guess what?
You're all invited! So come on!

07:57.120 --> 07:58.200
[cheering]

08:03.120 --> 08:05.159
-There it is!
-Yay!

08:06.479 --> 08:08.120
This is awesome!

08:11.599 --> 08:14.239
Wait! No! I need to get through!

08:14.400 --> 08:17.120
Ah! Cheesecake emergency!

08:17.280 --> 08:19.440
Sorry, I'm all out of cake.

08:20.479 --> 08:22.359
-But...
-Ahem!

08:22.679 --> 08:25.159
So... we're here.

08:25.320 --> 08:27.880
-Where's the party?
-Whoa!

08:28.080 --> 08:31.080
-That's a lot of guests.
-I can't believe it!

08:31.239 --> 08:35.199
All I wanted was a small,
quiet party,

08:35.360 --> 08:37.199
but the whole city is here,

08:37.360 --> 08:39.679
and we don't even have
cheesecake for Auntie Char,

08:40.280 --> 08:42.079
much less all these guests!

08:42.240 --> 08:46.760
Oh, Ollie, it's all my fault.
I didn't listen to you,

08:46.920 --> 08:48.520
and I got carried away instead,

08:48.680 --> 08:51.000
and I've ruined your special party!

08:51.160 --> 08:54.160
I'm so sorry!
But I'm going to make it better!

08:54.640 --> 08:58.319
Randy? Change of plans.
Forget all the stuff I ordered.

08:58.439 --> 09:00.160
We're going smaller and quieter.

09:00.280 --> 09:05.040
I'm gonna need eggs, cream
cheese and a really big spoon.

you went overboard today, Moon,

it still worked out great somehow.

and bouncy castle?

10:23.600 --> 10:27.120
Yeah. Ollie was right. You don't
need all that fancy stuff

towards big parties.
