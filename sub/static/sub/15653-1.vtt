01:18.278 --> 01:21.313
Freedom!

01:51.244 --> 01:52.444
Let's go.

02:20.607 --> 02:21.907
Holy shit.

02:21.909 --> 02:24.076
I've read
all about this place.

02:24.078 --> 02:25.978
Temple of
the nine moons, man.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.913
Sanctuary.
Like churches in <i> highlander.</i>

02:31.851 --> 02:32.985
Ok, just...

02:34.954 --> 02:37.422
These are lords, ok?

02:37.424 --> 02:38.957
Just listen to
what they have to say.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.159
Hear them out.

02:43.164 --> 02:46.698
You finally found
your place in the world.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.100
Our world.

02:49.369 --> 02:50.669
You're welcome.

02:51.838 --> 02:55.807
What you call
Mexico and Texas,

02:55.809 --> 02:59.344
we call tlalticpac,
the first realm.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.647
The realm of light.

03:01.649 --> 03:04.883
It's been our home
for thousands

03:04.885 --> 03:07.786
and thousands of moons.

03:09.722 --> 03:11.990
You really expect us
to give you a piece of it?

03:11.992 --> 03:15.727
We are grateful that you
took down a corrupt lord, so...

03:15.729 --> 03:17.029
Ximena.

03:22.569 --> 03:24.536
Tell them what they've won.

03:24.538 --> 03:27.906
As counselor
to lord venganza verdugo,

03:27.908 --> 03:29.641
it is my duty
to inform you,

03:29.643 --> 03:32.744
we have consulted
with all the lords present here,

03:32.746 --> 03:34.713
and the decision is final.

03:34.715 --> 03:38.150
Los hermanos gecko
shall be named oztomeca.

03:42.655 --> 03:44.523
What the fuck
are you doin'?

03:44.525 --> 03:45.958
Thank you.

03:47.393 --> 03:49.661
We're the collectors.

03:49.663 --> 03:50.896
So we're bagmen.

03:52.832 --> 03:54.399
I am not a bagman.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.768
The decision was not unanimous.

03:58.504 --> 04:00.172
If it were up to me,
you'd be back on the street...

04:02.108 --> 04:06.078
...robbing liquor stores.

04:06.080 --> 04:10.282
However, if you serve us well,
we'll consider a... promotion.

04:10.284 --> 04:12.918
Yeah, I have never robbed
a liquor store in my life.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.586
Thank you.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.755
Well, maybe it's time to
make you one of us, Mr. gecko.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.358
Like your brother.

04:19.360 --> 04:22.828
Well... well, you can
certainly die tryin'.

04:24.297 --> 04:25.797
Really?

04:31.938 --> 04:33.905
I'd like to see that.

04:33.907 --> 04:37.109
We must feast in honor
of this arrangement.

04:38.745 --> 04:40.946
Venganza,

04:40.948 --> 04:44.149
we'd better settle this with the
gods, before i change my mind.

05:08.908 --> 05:11.243
Look.

05:11.245 --> 05:14.713
The tastiest part.
Sure you don't want some?

05:16.616 --> 05:18.183
Knock yourself out.

05:37.804 --> 05:39.805
I'm not gonna
ask you again.

05:39.807 --> 05:43.508
And I am going to
fucking eat you alive!

05:43.510 --> 05:45.010
You were late
on your tribute,

05:45.012 --> 05:46.445
and we are the collectors.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.547
Been that way for what,
six months now?

05:48.549 --> 05:50.882
Jesus Christ, this is the
longest I've been stuck on a job

05:50.884 --> 05:53.051
since I was flippin' burgers
at big kahuna in high school.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.953
I flipped the burgers,
you bussed the tables.

05:54.955 --> 05:58.390
But the point is that the
lords depend on us to deliver.

05:58.392 --> 06:01.493
But for us to deliver,
you need to deliver.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.028
Like fed-fuckin'-ex.

06:03.030 --> 06:06.798
Absolutely, positively
has to be right here, right now.

06:06.800 --> 06:07.699
Three hundred and...

06:07.701 --> 06:09.167
...seventeen.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.136
Three hundred
and seventeen thousand

06:11.138 --> 06:13.572
from the contents
of the safe behind that bar,

06:13.574 --> 06:15.607
unless you want to get lit up
like a Roman candle.

06:18.578 --> 06:19.778
Ok.
Huh.

06:36.729 --> 06:38.697
See this?

06:38.699 --> 06:42.033
This is what happens when you
let a <i> pinche guero loco</i>

06:42.035 --> 06:46.204
and a fucking feed bag
run an operation.

06:51.878 --> 06:55.147
Feed bag? That is
a micro-aggression.

07:08.027 --> 07:09.494
Don't even think about it.

07:16.135 --> 07:18.203
I'm not going to
stand for this.

07:18.205 --> 07:20.739
Then sit down,
'cause this is the game.

07:20.741 --> 07:23.041
You knew that
when you signed up to play.

07:25.044 --> 07:29.815
What if I told you
the game is about to change?

07:31.150 --> 07:33.652
Seth. Come on.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.020
Yeah.

07:52.171 --> 07:54.706
They have no idea
what's coming, do they?

07:57.243 --> 07:58.810
They will.

08:50.129 --> 08:51.730
They're here.

08:51.732 --> 08:54.566
Alonzo's old school.
He's gonna kick like a mule.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.034
I was not the aggressor.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.702
You started
the whole goddamned thing!

08:57.704 --> 08:59.070
After he showed himself
to be the aggressor.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.372
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're like Van damme, then.

09:00.374 --> 09:01.873
You're misunderstood.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.675
Hey, Van damme
was not misunderstood.

09:03.677 --> 09:06.044
He was never appreciated.
There's a difference, you know.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.680
<i>Bloodsport</i> is not just
an action film.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.682
It's an exploration
of the battle

09:10.684 --> 09:13.885
between the proletariat
and the bourgeoisie.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.954
And the triumph
of the human spirit.

09:39.845 --> 09:40.946
You keep this safe, kid.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.948
Always,<i> señor.</i>

09:42.950 --> 09:45.450
You know he's like
170 years old, right?

09:45.452 --> 09:48.219
Yeah. Yeah,
of course I know that,

09:48.221 --> 09:49.955
but he likes it
when I call him "kid".

09:49.957 --> 09:52.057
Don't you, old man?
Makes him feel young.

09:52.059 --> 09:54.092
Yes, sir.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.060
Age is a state of mind.

09:55.062 --> 09:56.728
See?

09:56.730 --> 09:58.597
A <i> viejo</i> like me needs to be
reminded of that.

09:58.599 --> 09:59.698
Here, here.

10:03.402 --> 10:05.437
Oh, my god, wow.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.739
That is amazing.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.074
Where'd you learn to do that?

10:09.076 --> 10:10.775
Bartender I turned.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.311
You see, blood is the conduit
of the soul, brother.

10:13.313 --> 10:16.481
When I bite somebody, there's
some... sharing that happens.

10:16.483 --> 10:19.451
I pick up skills sometimes.
Know what I mean?

10:19.453 --> 10:20.952
Yeah.

10:24.458 --> 10:28.226
Age is just a state of mind.
I'll try and remember that.

10:29.395 --> 10:31.096
Well, I may not be immortal,

10:31.098 --> 10:33.264
but I intend to live
a nice full life,

10:33.266 --> 10:37.102
and then die,
in peace and comfort,

10:37.104 --> 10:38.570
on a beautiful beach.

10:40.406 --> 10:42.107
Yeah,

10:42.109 --> 10:43.842
but you won't be able
to get a boner.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.143
Nice.

10:52.084 --> 10:54.319
It's like a friggin'
junk drawer in there.

10:56.689 --> 10:58.957
"The penitent man shall pass."

10:58.959 --> 11:00.492
Totally.

11:27.186 --> 11:29.454
Peacekeeper.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.156
You can rest when you're dead.

11:31.158 --> 11:33.124
Don't you mean undead?

11:33.126 --> 11:35.126
I have a phone, you know.

11:35.128 --> 11:38.630
My boss is upset.
She wants to call a meeting.

11:38.632 --> 11:40.065
<i>Con los geckos.</i>

11:42.202 --> 11:44.035
What did they do now?

11:57.516 --> 12:00.785
Yo, yo. We got a situation.

12:08.928 --> 12:12.831
Lord venganza, it is my honor
to have an audience with you.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.366
You're not the first, Alonzo.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.402
I've been getting
a lot of complaints.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.237
Come on.

12:19.239 --> 12:22.240
Sit down.

12:38.724 --> 12:40.792
How the fuck could you
let this happen?

12:40.794 --> 12:43.294
You made this happen.
'Sides, he's a mid-boss.

12:43.296 --> 12:44.963
He's got the juice
to call this kinda meeting.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.632
What, 'cause we roughed
him up a little bit?

12:47.634 --> 12:49.167
Seems like a bitch move.

12:59.245 --> 13:04.582
It is totally
and absolutely unacceptable.

13:04.584 --> 13:08.653
It is totally
and absolutely unacceptable.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.922
If someone can't pay...

13:10.924 --> 13:13.591
...we sit down, we discuss it

13:13.593 --> 13:15.760
like civilized men...

13:15.762 --> 13:17.629
...and women, no?

13:21.168 --> 13:22.667
...doña venganza,

13:22.669 --> 13:24.836
you need to teach them a lesson.

13:26.272 --> 13:28.239
All the lords do.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.444
Forget this asshole, all right?
He's just a deadbeat

13:33.446 --> 13:35.013
who hates me
because I'm not a friggin'...

13:35.015 --> 13:37.315
the lords told me
to give you nothing.

13:37.317 --> 13:40.351
I went out on a limb
for you. Both of you.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.424
Lord venganza, he was late.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.493
We can show you the books.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.861
Maybe people don't like
the way we operate,

13:49.863 --> 13:50.929
but we do get it done.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.069
Ma'am.

14:03.777 --> 14:06.644
Señor Alonzo, trust that
i will deal with these men.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.046
But I think
we can all agree...

14:10.716 --> 14:12.083
That you were past due.

14:18.490 --> 14:19.724
You are correct.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.395
Allow me to...

14:24.397 --> 14:26.164
...pay you in full.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.265
Gun!

14:49.054 --> 14:50.788
The fuck?

15:01.834 --> 15:04.569
That... is not how vipers die.

15:05.838 --> 15:08.506
He's not a culebra anymore.

15:08.508 --> 15:09.741
He's worse.

15:10.776 --> 15:12.076
Much worse.

15:17.383 --> 15:19.417
Wait a second,
worse than a snake?

15:19.419 --> 15:21.052
I don't understand.
I thought we'd seen it all.

15:21.054 --> 15:24.088
Don't talk about things
you don't understand, Mr. gecko.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.723
You're right.
I don't understand, because

15:25.725 --> 15:28.026
Alonzo here flashed his fangs
at us last night.

15:28.028 --> 15:29.961
Now you're telling me
he's not one of you?

15:29.963 --> 15:31.562
He's been transformed.

15:31.564 --> 15:32.630
Into what?

15:34.199 --> 15:35.633
Stand down!

15:35.635 --> 15:37.035
These men
are not responsible.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.604
Go outside
and await my instructions.

15:45.978 --> 15:47.378
Never seen one of them
that scared.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.780
They're just caught off guard.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.081
No, I'm not talking about them.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.749
Yes, Emilio,

15:51.751 --> 15:54.052
it's calavera. I don't know how,
but I'm certain it's him.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.787
No, you're not understanding me.

15:55.789 --> 15:56.988
We have to get
the lords together.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.656
Now.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.491
Yes, as soon as I'm done here,
I'm heading over to you.

16:00.493 --> 16:04.062
Ximena. Transformed into what?

16:04.064 --> 16:06.631
This man...
Was taken by calavera.

16:06.633 --> 16:09.067
What?
The skull keeper.

16:09.069 --> 16:13.438
<i>A demon. Summoned by those</i>
<i> who require his unique gifts.</i>

16:13.440 --> 16:15.340
<i>In ancient times,</i>

16:15.342 --> 16:19.110
<i>he served the great armies</i>
<i> by infiltrating enemy lands.</i>

16:19.112 --> 16:23.481
<i>He traveled from</i><i> one village to
the next,</i><i> posing as an artisan.</i>

16:23.483 --> 16:26.284
<i>He destroys tribes from within.</i>

16:26.286 --> 16:29.821
<i>He doesn't kill his victims.</i>

16:29.823 --> 16:31.823
<i>He feasts on their skulls...</i>

16:31.825 --> 16:33.958
On their power.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.126
What power?

16:35.128 --> 16:36.260
Once he has your skull,

16:36.262 --> 16:40.498
he owns your mind.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.000
So this guy's
like a puppet.

16:42.002 --> 16:43.868
But he's not the only one.
Huh?

16:45.537 --> 16:46.871
These are stake guns.

16:46.873 --> 16:48.539
No one brought them.
They were planted.

16:53.178 --> 16:54.879
What does he want?
Whoa!

16:54.881 --> 16:56.280
Hey, hey, hey.
It's all right, boss.

16:56.282 --> 16:58.850
I checked the perimeter.
We're all clear.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.452
Just... let's everybody
just calm down, ok?

17:01.454 --> 17:02.687
He could be one of them.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.021
Then shoot him.

17:05.023 --> 17:08.291
What?
Shoot him in the head.

17:08.294 --> 17:10.862
Culebras can handle bullets,
as long as they're not stakes,

17:10.864 --> 17:14.165
but skull boy's little puppets?

17:14.166 --> 17:16.567
Shoot 'em in the head
and it's like <i> scanners.</i>

17:18.569 --> 17:20.538
No, no, no, no.
There's no way, ok?

17:20.540 --> 17:21.806
There's absolutely no way

17:21.808 --> 17:23.708
this bastard
got into our operation.

18:16.361 --> 18:17.462
Hey.

18:23.635 --> 18:25.470
You ain't authorized to be here.

18:27.539 --> 18:29.974
Are you listening to me?

18:29.976 --> 18:33.044
Stand up!
I said, stand up!

19:05.277 --> 19:07.845
Bring me some friends.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.348
I will bring you some friends.

19:18.190 --> 19:19.557
<i>Amigos.</i>

19:20.759 --> 19:22.660
Help me check something out.

19:35.207 --> 19:37.608
Alonzo said
the game was gonna change.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.143
This couldn't have been
what he meant.

19:39.145 --> 19:41.946
Sure, it could.
Kill a lord, change the rules.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.381
Why do you think
he called a sit-down?

19:43.383 --> 19:45.183
He didn't call anything.

19:45.185 --> 19:48.886
The skull keeper controls
his subjects. Completely.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.388
He is the one we're after.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.390
Ximena,

19:52.392 --> 19:55.459
the lords are gathering. You
and the peacekeeper are with me.

19:55.461 --> 19:58.829
Geckos. Find calavera
and destroy him.

19:58.831 --> 20:00.498
Uh... no, thank you.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.800
We're done with the whole
snake dance, all right?

20:02.802 --> 20:06.337
The skull keeper is not
a culebra. He is from xibalba.

20:06.339 --> 20:09.540
That's hell, Seth.
It's literally from hell.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.343
Oh, good. Then I'm sure
he can find his way back.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.478
Come on, Richard.
This is their problem.

20:16.248 --> 20:17.715
Their problem?

20:21.086 --> 20:22.920
Yeah.

20:22.922 --> 20:26.224
Your precious lord over there
gave us a job, remember?

20:26.226 --> 20:29.560
I am a collector,
not a... ghostbuster.

20:29.562 --> 20:33.064
Mr. gecko, he penetrated
your organization.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.432
He took one of your people.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.169
You are not my people.

20:40.339 --> 20:41.772
Not long ago...

20:43.408 --> 20:46.944
<i>Los hermanos</i> gecko
committed terrible...

20:46.946 --> 20:48.779
Terrible sins.

20:50.215 --> 20:52.583
You ran
south of the border,

20:52.585 --> 20:54.485
searching for redemption.

20:55.787 --> 20:58.256
What exactly did you find?

20:58.258 --> 21:01.092
Well, as I recall, a bar
full of watered-down drinks

21:01.094 --> 21:02.860
and overdressed bloodsuckers.

21:02.862 --> 21:05.796
They told me you were
looking for El Rey.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.632
You were trying
to get to heaven.

21:08.967 --> 21:10.968
If you believe in heaven,
Mr. gecko...

21:12.271 --> 21:14.105
I suggest

21:14.107 --> 21:15.673
you start to
believe in hell...

21:17.109 --> 21:19.110
Because it is coming.

21:24.549 --> 21:26.250
Things get a little real,
and you wanna take off.

21:26.252 --> 21:27.818
I'm stunned.
Look,

21:27.820 --> 21:29.220
you want to work your way
up the food chain,

21:29.222 --> 21:30.655
be my guest, ok?

21:30.657 --> 21:32.623
Go impress your bosses.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.325
Fuck, make yourself a lord!

21:35.728 --> 21:37.061
I'm done looking over
my shoulder

21:37.063 --> 21:38.729
every minute of everyday.

21:38.731 --> 21:41.232
Ah. So that's why
you're running. You're scared.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.770
You selfish little prick.

21:45.772 --> 21:47.405
I stuck around here to help you.

21:47.407 --> 21:50.941
Really? Because I'm not
your people, remember?

21:50.943 --> 21:52.977
You never gave a shit
about me or this place,

21:52.979 --> 21:54.645
about what we've built.

21:56.248 --> 22:00.184
Richard, we are flunkies.

22:00.186 --> 22:03.988
All right? We go to mid-bosses
and we beg for money.

22:05.324 --> 22:08.092
This place is built
on bad blood,

22:08.094 --> 22:09.360
on the body
of a dead kid.

22:09.362 --> 22:12.496
So we're going
to go there again.

22:12.498 --> 22:13.698
I didn't kill Kate.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.666
Carlos did.

22:17.102 --> 22:18.836
Are you even listening to me?

22:18.838 --> 22:20.538
Who touched my safe?

22:20.540 --> 22:22.306
What?

22:22.308 --> 22:25.276
I keep this dial at zero,
and it's not at zero.

22:25.278 --> 22:28.546
I got 75 grand in here
and, I swear to god,

22:28.548 --> 22:30.481
if it's not here, I'm gonna...

22:30.483 --> 22:34.352
You see? It's there.

22:34.354 --> 22:36.120
No, no, no.

22:36.122 --> 22:37.855
No, this is all rearranged.

22:37.857 --> 22:40.224
This skull fucker got somebody
all the way in here.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.366
Did you try
to crack my safe?

22:48.368 --> 22:50.067
What are you talkin' about?

22:51.403 --> 22:52.703
Oh. Nice.

22:52.705 --> 22:55.005
Have you lost your damn mind?

22:55.007 --> 22:56.240
What's going on here?

22:56.242 --> 22:58.476
Why don't you ask him?

22:58.478 --> 23:01.412
I'm sure he knows
all about your precious stash.

23:01.414 --> 23:02.747
I'm askin' you.

23:03.749 --> 23:06.751
Did you or did you not

23:06.753 --> 23:08.152
try to crack my safe?

23:10.188 --> 23:11.255
No.

23:17.162 --> 23:18.829
Ok, but you...
you're sure,

23:18.831 --> 23:21.265
right, you're sure about
what you said back there?

23:22.434 --> 23:25.269
A snake can survive
a bullet, yeah?

23:28.240 --> 23:31.542
I mean, it would hurt
like hell, but... yes.

23:31.544 --> 23:33.411
There's only one way
to find out.

23:33.413 --> 23:34.745
Are you fuckin' k...

23:55.767 --> 23:58.369
<i>Mira,</i> you're not supposed
to park here.

24:37.642 --> 24:39.176
That was a little much.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.514
He- he's coming back.
It's fine.

24:43.516 --> 24:44.982
Come here.

24:47.085 --> 24:49.520
Did you touch this?
No, no, I didn't.

24:49.522 --> 24:50.654
Well, who else knows it's here?

24:50.656 --> 24:51.856
I thought it was only us.

25:03.301 --> 25:05.002
You fuckin' dick!

25:05.004 --> 25:06.003
Relax!

25:06.005 --> 25:07.671
Ow!

25:07.673 --> 25:09.507
Son of a...

25:09.509 --> 25:11.709
Look, if that thing had gotten
to you, you'd be dead already.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.944
All right, just...
stop. Stop!

25:18.383 --> 25:20.784
I got a plan.

25:20.786 --> 25:24.221
Just... go.
Come on. I got...

25:28.059 --> 25:29.593
ah, shit.

25:31.329 --> 25:32.396
I almost forgot.

25:34.466 --> 25:35.966
Sorry, old man.

25:53.852 --> 25:56.120
Ok, ladies and gentlemen.

25:57.822 --> 26:00.424
Your soul speaks.

26:00.426 --> 26:01.759
We have a new operator in town,

26:01.761 --> 26:03.494
<i>your mind dies...</i>

26:03.496 --> 26:06.864
And I think he's trying
to take over this outfit,

26:06.866 --> 26:09.934
like a... tapeworm in our gut.

26:09.936 --> 26:12.202
Well, hawkeye
and trapper John aren't around,

26:12.204 --> 26:14.104
so I am here to perform
a minor procedure.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.940
You see, once our guy
gets a hold of you,

26:15.942 --> 26:18.375
he leaves you
in a state of, uh...

26:18.377 --> 26:20.578
Perpetual Britney.

26:20.580 --> 26:23.113
No lights in the attic.
Nothin' upstairs.

26:24.416 --> 26:28.218
Luckily, I have developed
a field test.

26:28.220 --> 26:32.890
Unfortunately, there may be
a bit of a mess involved...

26:32.892 --> 26:35.526
Worked for those bad guys
in <i> lethal weapon ii.</i>

26:37.095 --> 26:38.963
Boss?
Kalinda.

26:40.031 --> 26:41.365
You are my favorite assistant.

26:41.367 --> 26:44.635
Please don't hurt her,
Mr. gecko.

26:44.637 --> 26:46.203
Please don't hurt her,
Mr. gecko.

26:46.205 --> 26:50.274
I swear. I... I'm me!
I'm really me!

26:50.276 --> 26:51.775
How do I like
my old fashioned?

26:51.777 --> 26:55.346
Rye... rye whiskey
with two orange twists!

27:01.553 --> 27:02.620
Pass.

27:07.892 --> 27:09.893
Now, if nobody else
has anything to hide,

27:09.895 --> 27:11.228
this should go pretty quick.

27:16.067 --> 27:17.301
What the fuck?

27:18.570 --> 27:21.639
Sorry, jefe.
She was making a move.

27:24.976 --> 27:26.644
Well, it looks like
we got our tapeworm.

27:26.646 --> 27:29.013
I saw her in
the warehouse, searching.

27:29.015 --> 27:31.081
We should check.

27:31.083 --> 27:34.418
Everyone else,
hit the showers.

28:36.981 --> 28:38.215
Don't move!

28:41.553 --> 28:43.854
You were right.
Florinda's one of them.

28:43.856 --> 28:45.589
<i>She just blew open your safe.</i>

28:45.591 --> 28:47.524
Bring her over.

28:47.526 --> 28:50.260
With some pipes and chains.

28:50.262 --> 28:52.730
We're gonna figure out
what these two are up to.

28:57.001 --> 28:59.403
That's you in there,
you sneaky weasel?

29:02.373 --> 29:04.742
Guess you don't know
a long con when you see one.

29:04.744 --> 29:06.610
You played a game.

29:06.612 --> 29:08.612
To expose me.

29:08.614 --> 29:10.848
Ding-ding-ding. Level up.

29:10.850 --> 29:14.118
You're too late.
We have what we came for.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.786
Don't even think about...

29:34.939 --> 29:37.741
so these are
the legendary brothers

29:37.743 --> 29:40.577
who think they can
defeat the underworld.

29:40.579 --> 29:42.746
We're the ones
holding the guns, pal.

29:42.748 --> 29:46.750
Like all thieves,
what you think is valuable...

29:46.752 --> 29:48.719
...is merely worthless.

29:48.721 --> 29:51.321
Then why steal from us?
And try and kill venganza?

29:51.323 --> 29:53.490
You didn't need to do all
that to get to my stash.

29:55.493 --> 29:56.927
Answer the question.

29:56.929 --> 30:01.098
Go back to
your needles, Mr. gecko.

30:01.100 --> 30:04.802
You may not be a snake,
but you have your own venom.

30:06.237 --> 30:07.304
What did you say to me?

30:08.973 --> 30:10.407
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
hey, hey, hey...

30:10.409 --> 30:11.942
Don't do it, cris.

30:11.944 --> 30:13.477
Lower your weapons...

30:13.479 --> 30:15.913
...or we all die together.

30:15.915 --> 30:20.150
Ok, ok, ok. All right.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.319
Kinda reminds me of that
time we were in, um...

30:22.321 --> 30:24.188
Tallahassee, remember that?

30:25.456 --> 30:26.723
Yup.

30:30.628 --> 30:32.529
That was quite excellent.

30:32.531 --> 30:34.331
Oh, fuckin' a.

30:38.670 --> 30:39.903
No, no, no,
no, no, no...

31:07.332 --> 31:10.100
God. Great,
the gto's gone.

31:11.336 --> 31:13.237
So's his bike.

31:14.505 --> 31:18.742
She must have taken
the car. Our car.

31:20.078 --> 31:21.378
Tell me you got the...
we got it.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.313
Yeah?
We got it.

31:28.253 --> 31:31.321
Keep going, we're getting close.

31:31.323 --> 31:34.258
This whole hit on venganza.
It still doesn't wash.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.793
I mean, why call a sit-down
just to kill one lord?

31:38.029 --> 31:39.396
Right?

31:39.398 --> 31:41.598
Jesus Christ, he knew.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.000
He knew what?

31:44.168 --> 31:46.036
That I used to shoot up, ok?

31:46.038 --> 31:47.771
How did he know that?

31:47.773 --> 31:50.574
He is not a "he".

31:50.576 --> 31:53.010
He's a force. From hell.

31:53.012 --> 31:54.611
Were you not listening?

31:54.613 --> 31:57.281
Yes, I was listening,
but I also heard her say that...

31:57.283 --> 32:00.417
Skeletor's summoned,
all right? He's a lackey.

32:01.686 --> 32:04.121
You ask me,
somebody sent him to us.

32:10.261 --> 32:11.428
Lights.

32:35.887 --> 32:37.621
What the fuck?

32:39.223 --> 32:40.824
He's over there.

32:40.826 --> 32:42.059
With her.

33:00.511 --> 33:03.580
That's what he stole?
An amulet?

33:14.258 --> 33:16.793
Guess he doesn't
need her anymore.

33:16.795 --> 33:18.996
Oh, god, I'm gonna miss her.

33:21.299 --> 33:25.402
Look at all those skulls.
Where did he get those?

33:26.471 --> 33:28.939
Gotta be our guys.

33:28.941 --> 33:31.041
No. There's way too many.

33:31.043 --> 33:32.342
Shit.

33:32.344 --> 33:33.810
What?

33:33.812 --> 33:35.979
That's why he tried
to whack venganza.

33:35.981 --> 33:38.015
He knew it would force
a meeting of the lords.

33:38.017 --> 33:40.450
Those skulls are her bodyguards.

33:40.452 --> 33:42.452
He sent them back with her.

33:42.454 --> 33:44.254
He's going after
all of 'em.

33:50.561 --> 33:52.162
Venganza.
Emilio.

33:52.164 --> 33:56.566
It's official. Calavera was
one of the captured.

33:56.568 --> 33:58.502
We sentenced him to
the labyrinth centuries ago.

33:58.504 --> 34:00.971
Inside the temple
of the eternal feast.

34:00.973 --> 34:02.672
The twister?

34:02.674 --> 34:05.142
Yes, the twister.

34:05.144 --> 34:07.911
It was destroyed six moons ago
by Carlos madrigal.

34:14.351 --> 34:16.085
The skull keeper
did not escape from hell,

34:16.088 --> 34:18.722
he escaped from our prison.

34:26.164 --> 34:27.264
They all did.

34:27.266 --> 34:28.598
They?

34:28.600 --> 34:29.833
How many more are there?

34:29.835 --> 34:31.668
More than we can survive.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.409
Do you see them, master?

34:43.848 --> 34:45.581
I do.

34:56.860 --> 34:58.862
Shit. He's back at it.

34:58.864 --> 34:59.996
I gotta warn the peace-keeper.

35:01.899 --> 35:03.467
You got him on speed dial?

35:22.653 --> 35:24.121
Yeah.
<i>-He played us.</i>

35:24.123 --> 35:25.555
The whole hit on venganza,

35:25.557 --> 35:27.157
they did it
just to get to the guards!

35:35.634 --> 35:37.400
I'll call you back.

35:43.407 --> 35:45.842
Don't let anyone out, calavera.

35:45.844 --> 35:47.711
Understood.

35:52.917 --> 35:54.751
Brasa, you coward.

35:56.120 --> 35:57.854
How dare you come here.

36:22.346 --> 36:24.381
We gotta get her out of
here. No. We stay and fight!

36:28.519 --> 36:29.786
Ximena. He's right.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.722
He must not get to me.

36:57.682 --> 36:58.848
What the hell are you doing?

36:58.850 --> 37:00.417
Flippin' the burgers.

37:04.655 --> 37:05.755
Hey!

37:06.691 --> 37:08.091
Let him go, asshole!

37:11.562 --> 37:13.263
You will be ours now.

37:47.598 --> 37:49.399
They're all dead.

37:49.401 --> 37:52.068
Now, I'm the only lord left.

37:52.070 --> 37:53.770
I expect a bonus.

37:53.772 --> 37:56.139
This prison gang
from the labyrinth,

37:56.141 --> 37:57.941
they got a leader.

37:57.943 --> 38:01.544
His name is brasa.
A natural enemy of culebras.

38:01.546 --> 38:03.713
Well, it was a good plan.

38:03.715 --> 38:06.116
He hit us hard,
and he hit us fast.

38:06.118 --> 38:07.917
I'm sure there's gonna be
more to come.

38:07.919 --> 38:10.520
You sound as if
you're ready to fight.

38:11.756 --> 38:13.356
As long as there's a bonus.

38:14.625 --> 38:16.426
You know, my brother
likes to remind me

38:16.428 --> 38:18.962
that he's gonna live forever.

38:18.964 --> 38:20.764
You ask me,
that sounds a little overrated.

38:20.766 --> 38:23.033
I'm gonna go out
on my own terms.

38:25.803 --> 38:27.671
I want a free ticket to El Rey.

38:27.673 --> 38:30.240
He wants to die on a beach.

38:30.242 --> 38:32.976
I could make that happen.

38:32.978 --> 38:35.312
But I would not count
on paradise, Mr. gecko.

38:35.314 --> 38:36.813
Why's that?

38:36.815 --> 38:38.848
We are at war.

38:38.850 --> 38:41.818
Culebras have never lived
without their lords.

38:41.820 --> 38:45.155
The clans will fall.
There will be chaos.

38:45.157 --> 38:48.258
And trust me,
we're not ready for that,

38:48.260 --> 38:49.859
and neither are you.

38:56.200 --> 38:58.802
I can't believe
you're actually in.

38:58.804 --> 39:03.006
Well, if there's a heaven,
there's a hell, right?

39:05.176 --> 39:07.777
Maybe it's coming for us.

39:07.779 --> 39:09.612
What do you mean,
"coming for us"?

39:10.848 --> 39:13.083
For the things we've done.

39:15.019 --> 39:16.886
Maybe it's coming to collect.

39:57.027 --> 39:59.429
It's beautiful.

39:59.431 --> 40:00.630
Bring it to me.

40:05.936 --> 40:08.104
It's been too long.

40:21.552 --> 40:23.153
It's transcendent.

40:25.456 --> 40:26.990
Like you.

40:28.859 --> 40:30.760
Are you staring at me?

40:38.536 --> 40:41.137
I didn't think so.

40:42.305 --> 40:48.217
